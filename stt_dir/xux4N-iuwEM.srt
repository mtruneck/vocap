1
0:0:5,96 --> 0:0:9,56
Something new is happening
on planet Earth,


2
0:0:9,56 --> 0:0:13,68
big enough to be seen from space.


3
0:0:13,68 --> 0:0:20,44
Hot spots, buzzing with the energy
of millions of people.


4
0:0:20,44 --> 0:0:26,84
For the first time in human history,
more of us live in cities
than in the country.


5
0:0:26,84 --> 0:0:30,4
But these are cities
on a different scale.


6
0:0:30,4 --> 0:0:35,96
In just 50 years,
we've seen the birth, the growth


7
0:0:35,96 --> 0:0:43,52
and now the dominance
of the megacity.


8
0:0:43,52 --> 0:0:47,36
Sprawling, seething, noisy,
polluted,


9
0:0:47,36 --> 0:0:53,88
crammed with 10 million, 15,
sometimes even 30 million people.


10
0:0:53,88 --> 0:0:58,44
These cities are complicated,
fragile places,


11
0:0:58,44 --> 0:1:2,4
constantly on the edge.


12
0:1:2,4 --> 0:1:8,76
These are places
of overcrowded squalor.


13
0:1:8,76 --> 0:1:13,16
But these are also the most exciting
places on the earth.


14
0:1:13,16 --> 0:1:16,72
Brim with optimism and fun
and energy.


15
0:1:16,72 --> 0:1:19,0
Hey!
HE GRUNTS


16
0:1:19,0 --> 0:1:23,56
Love them or loathe them,
fear them or embrace them,


17
0:1:23,56 --> 0:1:31,56
the megacities are the human future
of the planet.


18
0:1:31,56 --> 0:1:33,48
We have, at the last count,


19
0:1:33,48 --> 0:1:37,8
created 21 of these
extraordinary urban sprawls.


20
0:1:37,8 --> 0:1:43,76
Pulsing and beating entities,
giant organisms in their own right.


21
0:1:43,76 --> 0:1:47,36
And these cities
and our experience of them


22
0:1:47,36 --> 0:1:50,32
is shaped by how
we move around them.


23
0:1:50,32 --> 0:1:53,48
Total chaos!
I would call it anarchy,


24
0:1:53,48 --> 0:1:56,4
but that would be extremely unfair
on anarchists.


25
0:1:56,4 --> 0:2:0,6
In this film, I'm going to be asking
how our megacities can survive


26
0:2:0,6 --> 0:2:3,68
without having
a colossal heart attack.


27
0:2:3,68 --> 0:2:7,64
Motorways, the freeways,
the railways below us


28
0:2:7,64 --> 0:2:10,24
are the veins and the arteries.


29
0:2:10,24 --> 0:2:15,8
But all round the world,
these arteries are getting
clogged up and congested.


30
0:2:15,8 --> 0:2:19,76
They're gobbling ever more
resources...


31
0:2:19,76 --> 0:2:21,92
That's some cow!


32
0:2:21,92 --> 0:2:26,48
..and dumping grotesque amounts
of waste.


33
0:2:26,48 --> 0:2:31,56
So, how does the metropolis
deal with all the stuff
its people don't want?


34
0:2:31,56 --> 0:2:34,28
Solid fat!


35
0:2:34,28 --> 0:2:38,44
Now I want to wipe my nose
but, on the whole, I think I won't.


36
0:2:38,44 --> 0:2:40,6
And what length do people go to


37
0:2:40,6 --> 0:2:44,6
to stop the modern metropolis
from drowning in its own excess?


38
0:2:44,6 --> 0:3:3,84
It's unimaginable,
what he's just lowered himself into.


39
0:3:3,84 --> 0:3:7,84
Why are our great cities
where they are


40
0:3:7,84 --> 0:3:11,4
and why are they the shape they are?


41
0:3:11,4 --> 0:3:12,92
All around the world,


42
0:3:12,92 --> 0:3:15,8
you see the same pattern.


43
0:3:15,8 --> 0:3:18,44
Coastlines and river mouths.


44
0:3:18,44 --> 0:3:19,92
And there's no mystery


45
0:3:19,92 --> 0:3:24,6
in why the great cities love to
dangle their feet in the water.


46
0:3:24,6 --> 0:3:26,92
Because throughout history,


47
0:3:26,92 --> 0:3:31,16
sea lanes and rivers
were the original superhighways


48
0:3:31,16 --> 0:3:38,92
and even today, it's transport -
that basic need to get in and out -


49
0:3:38,92 --> 0:3:41,92
that shapes and stretches


50
0:3:41,92 --> 0:4:0,32
and sometimes even strangles
the cities of the world.


51
0:4:0,32 --> 0:4:4,6
How to move millions of people
around a megacity 24 hours a day,


52
0:4:4,6 --> 0:4:7,28
without bringing the place
to a shuddering halt


53
0:4:7,28 --> 0:4:10,16
and without literally
choking its citizens to death,


54
0:4:10,16 --> 0:4:18,96
is one of the major challenges
we will face in the 21st century.


55
0:4:18,96 --> 0:4:21,4
I'm starting this journey
in one of the poorest,


56
0:4:21,4 --> 0:4:24,8
most chaotic and overcrowded cities
of them all -


57
0:4:24,8 --> 0:4:29,2
Dhaka in Bangladesh.


58
0:4:29,2 --> 0:4:34,24
There's simply no money for fancy
subways or slick freeways here.


59
0:4:34,24 --> 0:4:37,88
And with a population of 13 million,
and rising, to shunt around,


60
0:4:37,88 --> 0:4:44,56
Dhaka is feeling the squeeze.


61
0:4:44,56 --> 0:4:49,28
People still have to move around.
Whatever it takes.


62
0:4:49,28 --> 0:4:55,72
And it's hot, intense
and rather dangerous.


63
0:4:55,72 --> 0:5:0,92
Every great city depends entirely
on its transport system.


64
0:5:0,92 --> 0:5:5,8
But if there's one choke point
all round the world,
it's the morning rush hour,


65
0:5:5,8 --> 0:5:8,4
when millions upon millions
of people


66
0:5:8,4 --> 0:5:10,8
struggle to get to their jobs


67
0:5:10,8 --> 0:5:16,4
and, seemingly, will do
almost anything to make it in.


68
0:5:16,4 --> 0:5:21,24
The megacities are the most
extreme example of this,


69
0:5:21,24 --> 0:5:29,24
and the poorer ones
the most extreme of the extreme.


70
0:5:29,24 --> 0:5:33,52
There are so many people trying
to move around this dense city


71
0:5:33,52 --> 0:5:38,44
that it feels like there isn't
a rush hour, because the entire day
is one massive rush hour.


72
0:5:38,44 --> 0:5:39,72
A rush day.


73
0:5:39,72 --> 0:5:44,24
With just two train lines
to serve a population
the same size as London's,


74
0:5:44,24 --> 0:5:46,6
and only one major highway,


75
0:5:46,6 --> 0:5:51,44
the result is predictable mayhem.


76
0:5:51,44 --> 0:5:56,6
So, how can you get around a city
of 13 million people effectively?


77
0:5:56,6 --> 0:6:1,92
Actually, it's using one of the most
primitive modes of modern transport,


78
0:6:1,92 --> 0:6:3,48
pedal power.


79
0:6:3,48 --> 0:6:7,4
Because Dhaka is
the rickshaw capital of the world.


80
0:6:7,4 --> 0:6:11,8
Noisy, stinking, slow


81
0:6:11,8 --> 0:6:14,48
and extremely dangerous.


82
0:6:14,48 --> 0:6:16,6
CAR HORNS BEEP


83
0:6:16,6 --> 0:6:19,4
But for most people around the world


84
0:6:19,4 --> 0:6:23,2
this is the reality
of urban transport,


85
0:6:23,2 --> 0:6:29,68
not some dinky high-speed train.


86
0:6:29,68 --> 0:6:33,16
There are well over half a million
rickshaws in downtown Dhaka,


87
0:6:33,16 --> 0:6:36,56
that's roughly one
for every 20 people.


88
0:6:36,56 --> 0:6:41,4
Hardly surprising, then,
that 80 percent
of all male newcomers to Dhaka


89
0:6:41,4 --> 0:6:44,24
start out as one of these
human taxis.


90
0:6:44,24 --> 0:6:48,24
They work ten hours a day,
seven days a week,


91
0:6:48,24 --> 0:6:51,28
pulling some seriously heavy loads.


92
0:6:51,28 --> 0:6:57,0
And so, as a new arrival, I think it
only right I should have a go.


93
0:6:57,0 --> 0:7:2,2
Now, I'm a keen cyclist in London,
so how hard can this really be?


94
0:7:2,2 --> 0:7:5,0
MAN SPEAKS BENGALI


95
0:7:5,0 --> 0:7:10,92
TRANSLATION: It isn't the traffic.
He's saying it's difficult to ride
in a...


96
0:7:10,92 --> 0:7:12,84
Straight line? Yeah. Yeah.


97
0:7:12,84 --> 0:7:15,84
What are the most important rules
of the street?


98
0:7:15,84 --> 0:7:20,68
TRANSLATOR SPEAKS BENGALI


99
0:7:20,68 --> 0:7:24,88
The brake is the most important
thing. The brake's the most
important thing, OK.


100
0:7:24,88 --> 0:7:27,96
Is it as easy as riding a bike?


101
0:7:27,96 --> 0:7:37,68
THEY CHATTER IN BENGALI


102
0:7:37,68 --> 0:7:41,8
I think that means it's not as easy
as riding a bike!


103
0:7:41,8 --> 0:7:47,2
Here I go.


104
0:7:47,2 --> 0:7:49,4
HE LAUGHS


105
0:7:49,4 --> 0:7:55,88
Hey!
HE GRUNTS


106
0:7:55,88 --> 0:8:2,56
CHILDREN CHEER


107
0:8:2,56 --> 0:8:8,4
Apparently, there are 600,000
of these in the city.


108
0:8:8,4 --> 0:8:11,0
And I'm beginning to get a sense


109
0:8:11,0 --> 0:8:13,6
of how much human horsepower


110
0:8:13,6 --> 0:8:31,84
it takes to move Dhaka around.


111
0:8:31,84 --> 0:8:35,44
I'm supposed to keep to the left,
but it's so crowded here


112
0:8:35,44 --> 0:8:38,16
I'm being forced
into the middle of the road.


113
0:8:38,16 --> 0:8:44,6
And with a cab on the back,
it's difficult to judge exactly how
tight a gap I can squeeze through.


114
0:8:44,6 --> 0:8:47,4
Oh, my God! Oh, I'm sorry.


115
0:8:47,4 --> 0:8:48,8
Oh, I'm sorry.


116
0:8:48,8 --> 0:8:52,76
What you soon realise is, you can
never get up a good head of steam.


117
0:8:52,76 --> 0:8:56,0
You're constantly
stopping and starting.


118
0:8:56,0 --> 0:9:1,96
And it's far harder and much more
exhausting than it looks.


119
0:9:1,96 --> 0:9:6,96
That was both great fun
and really, really hard work.


120
0:9:6,96 --> 0:9:9,16
More difficult than it seems.


121
0:9:9,16 --> 0:9:13,44
I had a great time doing it
for about 20 minutes,
but I think that's about my lot.


122
0:9:13,44 --> 0:9:18,0
These guys do it for, what,
ten hours at a time or more?


123
0:9:18,0 --> 0:9:19,6
It's astonishing.


124
0:9:19,6 --> 0:9:22,6
They're said to be
as fit as Olympic athletes


125
0:9:22,6 --> 0:9:25,8
and I have to say,
I can well believe it.


126
0:9:25,8 --> 0:9:30,4
Thank you. OK. Thanks, guys.


127
0:9:30,4 --> 0:9:32,56
But Dhaka's reliance on rickshaws


128
0:9:32,56 --> 0:9:35,44
means more than simply
back-breaking labour


129
0:9:35,44 --> 0:9:37,8
for tens of thousands
of its citizens.


130
0:9:37,8 --> 0:9:40,92
It also affects
the shape of the city.


131
0:9:40,92 --> 0:9:44,12
Because if your only means
of getting around is by rickshaw,


132
0:9:44,12 --> 0:9:48,28
then you are restricted to
travelling fairly short distances.


133
0:9:48,28 --> 0:9:50,0
Which means, in turn,


134
0:9:50,0 --> 0:9:56,28
that Dhaka is one of the most
densely-populated metropolises
in the world.


135
0:9:56,28 --> 0:10:1,64
If you look at the map of any
old city and see how it grows,


136
0:10:1,64 --> 0:10:7,2
you can see that it expands
in concentric rings
as the transport gets better.


137
0:10:7,2 --> 0:10:9,48
From horses to bicycles,


138
0:10:9,48 --> 0:10:13,4
to cars and trams
and trains and metro,


139
0:10:13,4 --> 0:10:16,64
the bigger the rings,
the more effective the transport.


140
0:10:16,64 --> 0:10:21,16
There's one very simple truth...


141
0:10:21,16 --> 0:10:25,2
The better the transport,
the bigger the city can grow.


142
0:10:25,2 --> 0:10:29,76
And today's megacities
have taken that simple truth


143
0:10:29,76 --> 0:10:35,4
and pushed it
to the absolute extreme.


144
0:10:35,4 --> 0:10:39,68
London. One of the planet's
first great metropolises.


145
0:10:39,68 --> 0:10:43,84
With a population of 13 million,
including all its surrounding areas,


146
0:10:43,84 --> 0:10:48,6
this city was built not on roads
but on steel.


147
0:10:48,6 --> 0:10:50,72
In the early 19th Century,


148
0:10:50,72 --> 0:10:55,28
London was 30 times smaller
than it is today.


149
0:10:55,28 --> 0:11:0,0
With only horsepower
to move its people around,
it simply couldn't get any bigger.


150
0:11:0,0 --> 0:11:5,52
And then a revolutionary new form
of transport started to reshape
this great metropolis


151
0:11:5,52 --> 0:11:9,36
and all of Britain's
other big cities.


152
0:11:9,36 --> 0:11:14,28
The oldest megacities, like London,
were only ever able to gobble up
the land around them


153
0:11:14,28 --> 0:11:18,24
thanks to whizzy new technologies
like the train.


154
0:11:18,24 --> 0:11:23,48
As the tendrils of train and tram
networks spread out from the centre,


155
0:11:23,48 --> 0:11:26,48
the suburbs followed
and the population mushroomed.


156
0:11:26,48 --> 0:11:30,92
And just when it looked as if
the train companies
couldn't demolish any more houses


157
0:11:30,92 --> 0:11:32,88
to build any more lines,


158
0:11:32,88 --> 0:11:40,56
they had another bright idea -
to go under the houses instead.


159
0:11:40,56 --> 0:11:44,88
From the opening of the first
underground station in 1863,


160
0:11:44,88 --> 0:11:50,0
in just 40 years, the population
trebled to six million.


161
0:11:50,0 --> 0:11:54,0
London's roots would become
criss-crossed by a web of tunnels,


162
0:11:54,0 --> 0:12:0,92
transporting more than
2.5 million people every day.


163
0:12:0,92 --> 0:12:3,6
It was revolutionary.


164
0:12:3,6 --> 0:12:6,8
And in the 150 years or so
since then,


165
0:12:6,8 --> 0:12:9,28
the London Underground
has hugely expanded


166
0:12:9,28 --> 0:12:12,6
and been rebuilt and patched up
and grown and copied.


167
0:12:12,6 --> 0:12:16,44
But everything has its limits.


168
0:12:16,44 --> 0:12:20,72
The number of people you
can squeeze through these tubes


169
0:12:20,72 --> 0:12:25,12
has now reached its maximum.


170
0:12:25,12 --> 0:12:31,32
It's a bit as if you were given
one pair of trousers for life


171
0:12:31,32 --> 0:12:33,64
at the age of 12.


172
0:12:33,64 --> 0:12:36,56
You get bigger and bigger


173
0:12:36,56 --> 0:12:40,92
and, first of all, the trousers
start to squeeze a little bit


174
0:12:40,92 --> 0:12:44,12
and then it's a really painful
squeeze.


175
0:12:44,12 --> 0:12:49,92
Well, this wonderful piece
of world-breaking technology


176
0:12:49,92 --> 0:12:58,0
has now become
London's painful squeeze.


177
0:12:58,0 --> 0:13:1,56
That is the problem
with these arteries of megacities.


178
0:13:1,56 --> 0:13:4,6
Very easily,
they become crammed and sclerotic


179
0:13:4,6 --> 0:13:7,2
and they're on the edge of collapse
again.


180
0:13:7,2 --> 0:13:11,16
The men who built
the London Underground
thought they had their city sorted.


181
0:13:11,16 --> 0:13:13,56
Nothing lasts forever.


182
0:13:13,56 --> 0:13:16,32
Success sucks in many more people


183
0:13:16,32 --> 0:13:19,28
until it starts to feel
like failure.


184
0:13:19,28 --> 0:13:23,48
That doesn't stop people
on the other side of the world
trying just the same thing,


185
0:13:23,48 --> 0:13:30,72
though bigger and faster
than London.


186
0:13:30,72 --> 0:13:34,2
This is the Shanghai Metro.


187
0:13:34,2 --> 0:13:38,56
20 years ago, Shanghai didn't have
an underground at all.


188
0:13:38,56 --> 0:13:41,28
Now it boasts the largest one
in the world,


189
0:13:41,28 --> 0:13:49,4
and they've built it
at an awesome speed.


190
0:13:49,4 --> 0:13:53,4
TRANSLATION: The total soil
excavated after completion
of the networks


191
0:13:53,4 --> 0:13:55,64
will be around 22 million tonnes,


192
0:13:55,64 --> 0:13:59,36
including all the soil that needs
to be dug out of the stations.


193
0:13:59,36 --> 0:14:6,4
22 million tonnes!


194
0:14:6,4 --> 0:14:8,12
I'm very proud of what we've done.


195
0:14:8,12 --> 0:14:12,12
In the last few years, we've managed
to complete the same length of lines


196
0:14:12,12 --> 0:14:15,16
that it's taken 100 years
for foreigners to build.


197
0:14:15,16 --> 0:14:22,32
It's a great method of transport.


198
0:14:22,32 --> 0:14:26,52
I'm sure London's engineers were
just as confident all that time ago.


199
0:14:26,52 --> 0:14:29,8
But the Chinese Government
haven't stopped with a mere subway.


200
0:14:29,8 --> 0:14:32,2
They've spent well over
a billion pounds


201
0:14:32,2 --> 0:14:35,24
on a revolutionary new
overground train system


202
0:14:35,24 --> 0:14:37,52
known as the Maglev.


203
0:14:37,52 --> 0:14:40,96
These trains, built in Germany,
have no wheels.


204
0:14:40,96 --> 0:14:43,56
Using magnetic levitation,


205
0:14:43,56 --> 0:14:48,96
they literally float along the track
at extraordinary speeds.


206
0:14:48,96 --> 0:14:52,28
We're doing 380 kilometres an hour.


207
0:14:52,28 --> 0:14:56,28
385. 388. 390.


208
0:14:56,28 --> 0:15:0,0
400 kilometres an hour.


209
0:15:0,0 --> 0:15:2,52
425, six, seven.


210
0:15:2,52 --> 0:15:7,72
431. We're now doing more than
431 kilometres an hour.


211
0:15:7,72 --> 0:15:10,96
I think that's about
270 miles an hour.


212
0:15:10,96 --> 0:15:13,32
This thing is flying.


213
0:15:13,32 --> 0:15:22,44
It makes a British InterCity train
look like a horse and cart.


214
0:15:22,44 --> 0:15:25,6
And just as the tubes
reshaped London,


215
0:15:25,6 --> 0:15:28,8
it's thought that
these super-fast services


216
0:15:28,8 --> 0:15:36,68
will reshape this entire area
of China.


217
0:15:36,68 --> 0:15:39,0
It's too soon to say


218
0:15:39,0 --> 0:15:43,88
how Maglev trains
might reshape China,


219
0:15:43,88 --> 0:15:49,32
but experts are already talking
about giant urban areas


220
0:15:49,32 --> 0:15:54,4
of perhaps 100 million people each.


221
0:15:54,4 --> 0:15:57,8
This is how futuristic transport


222
0:15:57,8 --> 0:16:6,32
can entirely reshape
the way we think now about cities.


223
0:16:6,32 --> 0:16:10,0
Then again, I'm not so sure.


224
0:16:10,0 --> 0:16:12,96
People's dreams
of futuristic freedom


225
0:16:12,96 --> 0:16:15,76
rarely pan out
the way that's expected,


226
0:16:15,76 --> 0:16:17,8
and there's no clearer example
of that


227
0:16:17,8 --> 0:16:22,4
than what's become
the true curse of the megacity
the world over -


228
0:16:22,4 --> 0:16:25,32
the humble car.


229
0:16:25,32 --> 0:16:30,88
And the people of Shanghai
are in love with that.


230
0:16:30,88 --> 0:16:36,4
In China, just 25 years ago,
private cars were banned.


231
0:16:36,4 --> 0:16:40,0
Now they're joining the roads
of Shanghai alone


232
0:16:40,0 --> 0:16:43,72
at the rate of 1,000 every day.


233
0:16:43,72 --> 0:16:55,2
And China has become
the largest car market in the world.


234
0:16:55,2 --> 0:17:0,8
Meet Shanghai citizens,
Wenbing Wu and his wife Jee Chen.


235
0:17:0,8 --> 0:17:6,32
They've come to the BYD,
or Build Your Dream,
car showroom in Shanghai


236
0:17:6,32 --> 0:17:9,4
to take a look at a new motor.


237
0:17:9,4 --> 0:17:14,88
This would be the first vehicle
that they, or any of their family,
have ever owned.


238
0:17:14,88 --> 0:17:21,8
As far as I'm concerned,
they have no idea of what
they're letting themselves in for.


239
0:17:21,8 --> 0:17:27,44
TRANSLATION: We had to save
every month. We've been saving up
for a really long time.


240
0:17:27,44 --> 0:17:31,8
Wenbing and Jee are typical
of the megacity-dwelling Chinese.


241
0:17:31,8 --> 0:17:36,24
The thing about cars,
is that they are just so appealing.


242
0:17:36,24 --> 0:17:39,52
Who would want to sit
on a sweaty subway


243
0:17:39,52 --> 0:17:44,4
or cram into a crowded bus
when you can cruise
in air-conditioned comfort?


244
0:17:44,4 --> 0:17:47,56
For many of us,
commuting by public transport


245
0:17:47,56 --> 0:17:50,24
is such a gruelling experience


246
0:17:50,24 --> 0:17:53,4
that getting a private car
is a tempting alternative.


247
0:17:53,4 --> 0:17:56,64
But this is about more
than just getting from A to B.


248
0:17:56,64 --> 0:17:59,4
It's about status.


249
0:17:59,4 --> 0:18:1,72
Now, in a place like Shanghai,


250
0:18:1,72 --> 0:18:7,52
having a shiny new car of your own
shows that you have made it.


251
0:18:7,52 --> 0:18:10,64
For this couple,
it's clearly cost them a lot,


252
0:18:10,64 --> 0:18:16,52
but they seem convinced that their
new car's going to be worth it.


253
0:18:16,52 --> 0:18:20,88
Now we've managed to get a car,
all of my family
are really happy about it.


254
0:18:20,88 --> 0:18:25,28
It's like you've realised
what you've been dreaming about
for so long.


255
0:18:25,28 --> 0:18:31,96
So all of us are really happy.


256
0:18:31,96 --> 0:18:36,76
If only we could take them by the
hand and lead them to the streets
of...


257
0:18:36,76 --> 0:18:43,72
Mexico City, say.


258
0:18:43,72 --> 0:18:48,12
For this really is a city
built on tarmac.


259
0:18:48,12 --> 0:18:50,96
Here there are almost
20 million people


260
0:18:50,96 --> 0:18:56,44
and nearly five million cars.


261
0:18:56,44 --> 0:18:58,88
Traffic here is so heavy


262
0:18:58,88 --> 0:19:5,8
that commuters can spend six hours a
day, a third of their waking lives,


263
0:19:5,8 --> 0:19:7,32
sitting in their cars


264
0:19:7,32 --> 0:19:9,68
just trying to get to work.


265
0:19:9,68 --> 0:19:12,88
This is transport
not just shaping the megacity,


266
0:19:12,88 --> 0:19:22,68
it's in danger of killing it.


267
0:19:22,68 --> 0:19:26,4
The motorways, the freeways,
the railways below us


268
0:19:26,4 --> 0:19:31,0
are the veins and the arteries
of any city.


269
0:19:31,0 --> 0:19:35,4
We're in Mexico City, one of the
most congested places on the planet.


270
0:19:35,4 --> 0:19:39,76
These arteries are getting
clogged up and congested.


271
0:19:39,76 --> 0:19:44,2
And we know what happens
if you get too much of that.


272
0:19:44,2 --> 0:19:48,4
You get an urban heart attack.


273
0:19:48,4 --> 0:19:59,6
Mexico City's traffic cops
are fighting a war,
and they are not winning.


274
0:19:59,6 --> 0:20:3,0
I'm with the police helicopter pilot
Captain Oscar Cardenta


275
0:20:3,0 --> 0:20:9,24
to get a whirlybird's-eye-view
of the morning commute.


276
0:20:9,24 --> 0:20:13,68
Just 7:30am.
Already jams are forming down below,


277
0:20:13,68 --> 0:20:18,48
and they stretch as far
as we can see.


278
0:20:18,48 --> 0:20:22,4
Right now,
we're going to be coming up on, uh,


279
0:20:22,4 --> 0:20:26,2
on Periferico, which is usually
very busy at this time of day.


280
0:20:26,2 --> 0:20:29,92
Mexico City's Periferico
is the city's major ring road.


281
0:20:29,92 --> 0:20:35,84
If anything goes wrong here,
the police know it will spawn
rush-hour hell.


282
0:20:35,84 --> 0:20:39,32
How can you help from the air?
I have a traffic specialist


283
0:20:39,32 --> 0:20:42,4
and he's giving orders
to the people on the ground


284
0:20:42,4 --> 0:20:46,32
to detour the traffic,
control the flow.


285
0:20:46,32 --> 0:20:48,88
It isn't long before
Oscar spots trouble.


286
0:20:48,88 --> 0:20:52,4
Something's slowing down
the traffic on a critical flyover.


287
0:20:52,4 --> 0:20:55,8
Left unchecked, this could spell
gridlock, so he's straight onto it


288
0:20:55,8 --> 0:21:2,32
and a team of motorbike
traffic police are despatched.


289
0:21:2,32 --> 0:21:4,4
They're going to need to act quickly


290
0:21:4,4 --> 0:21:9,8
because any hold-ups can degenerate
into city-wide chaos.


291
0:21:9,8 --> 0:21:12,6
This time, it just turns out to be
a broken-down car.


292
0:21:12,6 --> 0:21:20,16
The young couple driving it
have simply run out of petrol.


293
0:21:20,16 --> 0:21:22,56
No hanging around for the AA here.


294
0:21:22,56 --> 0:21:26,0
So dire is the congestion,
that in Mexico City


295
0:21:26,0 --> 0:21:34,2
the police have learned
to improvise.


296
0:21:34,2 --> 0:21:41,48
Unconventional, but it works.


297
0:21:41,48 --> 0:21:46,88
So if we're all going to live
in the megacity, and it rather
looks like most of us will,


298
0:21:46,88 --> 0:21:53,36
are we all condemned to a future
of choking jams
and sweat-packed tube trains?


299
0:21:53,36 --> 0:21:58,8
No, I think that maybe
we don't want to turn our backs
on our low-tech past.


300
0:21:58,8 --> 0:22:4,0
Maybe Dhaka and its half a million
cycle rickshaws


301
0:22:4,0 --> 0:22:8,76
does have something to teach us.


302
0:22:8,76 --> 0:22:10,64
Across the globe


303
0:22:10,64 --> 0:22:19,28
and London is gearing up
for a three-speed revolution.


304
0:22:19,28 --> 0:22:22,12
To get real change in the city,
you need two things.


305
0:22:22,12 --> 0:22:26,64
You need pent-up demand
on the streets
and you need proper leadership.


306
0:22:26,64 --> 0:22:30,0
When the two come together,
change can happen very, very fast.


307
0:22:30,0 --> 0:22:35,8
A good example would be
the London bicycle scheme.


308
0:22:35,8 --> 0:22:39,0
When this got going...


309
0:22:39,0 --> 0:22:41,8
..a lot of people said,
"It's not going to work,"


310
0:22:41,8 --> 0:22:45,56
and within the first ten weeks
there were a million journeys made.


311
0:22:45,56 --> 0:22:49,52
# I seen you riding around
The streets at night


312
0:22:49,52 --> 0:22:52,44
# On your bicycle #


313
0:22:52,44 --> 0:22:57,92
There's no single magic bullet
that's going to solve the megacity
transport crisis.


314
0:22:57,92 --> 0:23:1,4
We have to snaffle ideas
from all over the place,


315
0:23:1,4 --> 0:23:3,56
taking smaller, smarter solutions


316
0:23:3,56 --> 0:23:6,92
which, when you take them together,
can have an impact.


317
0:23:6,92 --> 0:23:9,96
London's first large-scale
public bike-hire scheme


318
0:23:9,96 --> 0:23:17,68
is part of that potential mix.


319
0:23:17,68 --> 0:23:21,8
In the economy of the great cities,


320
0:23:21,8 --> 0:23:25,8
they're always learning and copying
and stealing from each other.


321
0:23:25,8 --> 0:23:28,2
And it's not just
from the hi-tech cities.


322
0:23:28,2 --> 0:23:31,88
So Dhaka in Bangladesh
may be a nightmare,


323
0:23:31,88 --> 0:23:35,2
but it's a nightmare
run on pedal power


324
0:23:35,2 --> 0:23:38,8
and that's something that
modern cities are re-learning.


325
0:23:38,8 --> 0:23:43,32
And so to have a transport system
that really works
you need everything.


326
0:23:43,32 --> 0:23:48,2
You need the taxis and the cars
and the buses.


327
0:23:48,2 --> 0:23:52,2
You need the trains
and you need bicycles


328
0:23:52,2 --> 0:23:57,4
and, of course, decent places
to be able to walk safely, as well.


329
0:23:57,4 --> 0:24:2,8
It's a bit like fusion food,
you know, that we eat all the time.


330
0:24:2,8 --> 0:24:8,8
You bring in all sorts of lessons,
all sorts of flavours


331
0:24:8,8 --> 0:24:9,8
and you mix them up


332
0:24:9,8 --> 0:24:12,2
and with a bit of luck
and leadership,


333
0:24:12,2 --> 0:24:19,68
you get a city that's moving again.


334
0:24:19,68 --> 0:24:24,4
This is an example of how the
megacity can function at its best.


335
0:24:24,4 --> 0:24:27,52
A bit of technological innovation,
some risk,


336
0:24:27,52 --> 0:24:32,8
fingers crossed, and openness
to what's worked elsewhere.


337
0:24:32,8 --> 0:24:34,12
And what goes for transport


338
0:24:34,12 --> 0:24:36,48
goes for what is transported,
as well.


339
0:24:36,48 --> 0:24:39,84
And not just people.


340
0:24:39,84 --> 0:24:42,8
Moving all of those commuters
around,


341
0:24:42,8 --> 0:24:46,8
that's just one layer
of the amazing web of activity.


342
0:24:46,8 --> 0:24:49,8
Because these people
need to be clothed and fed


343
0:24:49,8 --> 0:24:52,48
and kept warm and watered,


344
0:24:52,48 --> 0:24:56,2
and that means
that the megacity's routes


345
0:24:56,2 --> 0:25:1,0
stretch far beyond
the ordinary city boundaries,


346
0:25:1,0 --> 0:25:4,68
to far-off generators
providing the electricity


347
0:25:4,68 --> 0:25:9,6
or distant mountain reservoirs
providing the piped water.


348
0:25:9,6 --> 0:25:14,12
But the greatest appetite is,
of course, for food.


349
0:25:14,12 --> 0:25:21,44
The megacities are monstrous hungry.


350
0:25:21,44 --> 0:25:24,52
24 hours a day, seven days a week,


351
0:25:24,52 --> 0:25:27,76
they suck in an astonishing array
of food.


352
0:25:27,76 --> 0:25:30,48
Flown, shipped and driven in
from all round the world,


353
0:25:30,48 --> 0:25:46,76
and we expect it served how,
when and where we want it.


354
0:25:46,76 --> 0:25:51,8
London is no exception. It's one
very hungry and thirsty megacity.


355
0:25:51,8 --> 0:25:55,4
Every year, London eats
seven million tonnes of food


356
0:25:55,4 --> 0:26:0,56
and downs 94 million litres
of bottled water alone.


357
0:26:0,56 --> 0:26:6,48
London's total food footprint
is 125 times its size.


358
0:26:6,48 --> 0:26:12,0
In other words, it requires
the equivalent of the entire
productive land of mainland Britain


359
0:26:12,0 --> 0:26:22,76
to feed London.


360
0:26:22,76 --> 0:26:26,2
Such is the megacity's demand
for fresh food,


361
0:26:26,2 --> 0:26:30,8
we're forced to grow it
on an increasingly industrial scale.


362
0:26:30,8 --> 0:26:36,6
Even the humble lettuce
gets the treatment.


363
0:26:36,6 --> 0:26:41,36
This farm produces over
60 million lettuces every year.


364
0:26:41,36 --> 0:26:48,84
And to do that, it takes a
well-drilled small army of pickers.


365
0:26:48,84 --> 0:26:52,28
Plants get lifted, and then
creeping just behind is a machine


366
0:26:52,28 --> 0:26:57,6
with yet more workers
bagging and packing.


367
0:26:57,6 --> 0:27:2,2
Within another 24 to 48 hours,
they'll have been
whisked down a motorway,


368
0:27:2,2 --> 0:27:5,8
unloaded, sorted, packed,
loaded up again,


369
0:27:5,8 --> 0:27:8,92
and now they're in your fridge
perhaps.


370
0:27:8,92 --> 0:27:17,8
Or they might end up here,
in one of the strangest supermarkets
I've ever been to.


371
0:27:17,8 --> 0:27:22,32
It is supersized.


372
0:27:22,32 --> 0:27:27,0
It looks like an ordinary
supermarket, but it plainly isn't.


373
0:27:27,0 --> 0:27:30,68
The aisles are too big, the trolleys
in those aisles are too big


374
0:27:30,68 --> 0:27:34,6
and the people doing the picking
are all dressed in uniforms.


375
0:27:34,6 --> 0:27:38,8
Because the food that
they're choosing, they're not
going to take home and eat.


376
0:27:38,8 --> 0:27:42,4
They're not going to wash with
the shampoo that they're selecting


377
0:27:42,4 --> 0:27:45,2
or drink the drinks
they're taking off the shelves.


378
0:27:45,2 --> 0:27:48,2
They are buying for online shoppers


379
0:27:48,2 --> 0:27:57,68
and they're being told what to pick
and how to pick it by a computer.


380
0:27:57,68 --> 0:28:3,12
So right now,
to help feed the megacity,
welcome to the mega supermarket.


381
0:28:3,12 --> 0:28:6,8
The shelves of this unique
London Tesco online store


382
0:28:6,8 --> 0:28:9,8
groan with 22,500 items,


383
0:28:9,8 --> 0:28:15,6
spread over the equivalent
of three football pitches.


384
0:28:15,6 --> 0:28:19,6
There are no bright and shiny signs
enticing you to buy here,


385
0:28:19,6 --> 0:28:26,36
just series of numbers and codes
guiding the pickers.


386
0:28:26,36 --> 0:28:29,96
When we pick,
we have to pick by location.


387
0:28:29,96 --> 0:28:33,0
OK. So pick by location first...


388
0:28:33,0 --> 0:28:36,4
It's the numbers of the aisles
you're looking for? Yes.


389
0:28:36,4 --> 0:28:40,6
So you're looking for 61. Yeah.
D2. Right.


390
0:28:40,6 --> 0:28:44,2
Almond milk. Almond?


391
0:28:44,2 --> 0:28:49,8
That's the one. That's the one.
That's the one.


392
0:28:49,8 --> 0:28:55,0
Sharon and her fellow workers
end up picking a total
of 1,800 orders every day.


393
0:28:55,0 --> 0:28:58,76
That's like shopping
600,000 times for groceries a year.


394
0:28:58,76 --> 0:29:1,48
Quite a lot,
it's a battle with the clock


395
0:29:1,48 --> 0:29:5,12
to juggle up to six separate
customer orders at one go.


396
0:29:5,12 --> 0:29:8,12
They've all booked
their delivery slots.


397
0:29:8,12 --> 0:29:13,0
And how quick do you have to be
normally, when you're not surrounded
by people like me?


398
0:29:13,0 --> 0:29:17,0
Erm, we've got a time bar
at the bottom


399
0:29:17,0 --> 0:29:21,8
that tells us
how quickly we're going.


400
0:29:21,8 --> 0:29:26,4
At the moment, it's red and...
You're not going fast enough? No.


401
0:29:26,4 --> 0:29:28,24
I'm well out of time.


402
0:29:28,24 --> 0:29:32,2
So they're possibly waiting for me,
but...


403
0:29:32,2 --> 0:29:36,76
So there's a specific van
waiting for you? Yeah.


404
0:29:36,76 --> 0:29:42,12
Being ordered around by a computer
might make this a seemingly
alienating job,


405
0:29:42,12 --> 0:29:46,8
but I'm reassured there is
a personal touch, however small.


406
0:29:46,8 --> 0:29:49,76
So, what happens if
you get to your number


407
0:29:49,76 --> 0:29:53,16
and what they want isn't there?


408
0:29:53,16 --> 0:29:55,4
We have to put a substitution in.


409
0:29:55,4 --> 0:29:59,92
I mean, like, I've substituted
this morning, erm, red wine.


410
0:29:59,92 --> 0:30:5,8
They wanted Cabernet Sauvignon.
Yeah. I substituted it with Shiraz.


411
0:30:5,8 --> 0:30:11,8
Right. Shiraz is better anyway!


412
0:30:11,8 --> 0:30:15,0
The megacity says,
"Make it bigger, do it faster."


413
0:30:15,0 --> 0:30:17,4
These people are presumably
shopping online


414
0:30:17,4 --> 0:30:20,6
because their own lives
are so stressed and under the cosh,


415
0:30:20,6 --> 0:30:23,0
they haven't got time to shop
for themselves.


416
0:30:23,0 --> 0:30:26,4
The result is that they produce
a whole other group of people


417
0:30:26,4 --> 0:30:30,6
who are also rushing around,
shopping against the clock.


418
0:30:30,6 --> 0:30:34,2
But it's a curious business.
What you choose to put in your mouth


419
0:30:34,2 --> 0:30:37,0
or put down your throat
or clean yourself with,


420
0:30:37,0 --> 0:30:39,2
these are intimate decisions


421
0:30:39,2 --> 0:30:43,4
and we rely
if not on the kindness of strangers


422
0:30:43,4 --> 0:30:46,0
then the choice of strangers.


423
0:30:46,0 --> 0:30:55,4
The honesty of strangers.
The hard work of strangers.


424
0:30:55,4 --> 0:30:58,8
Of course, all this consumption
inevitably has a consequence.


425
0:30:58,8 --> 0:31:4,68
Our modern megacities spew out
huge quantities of waste.


426
0:31:4,68 --> 0:31:8,8
Every year, London throws away
20 million tonnes of the stuff.


427
0:31:8,8 --> 0:31:11,56
Trying to cope
with just some of the deluge


428
0:31:11,56 --> 0:31:13,96
is causing a massive strain
for megacities.


429
0:31:13,96 --> 0:31:17,8
An astonishing 40,000 miles
of sewers


430
0:31:17,8 --> 0:31:20,56
lurk beneath Greater London.


431
0:31:20,56 --> 0:31:22,84
Uncoiled and laid end-to-end,


432
0:31:22,84 --> 0:31:26,4
they'd stretch twice
around the world.


433
0:31:26,4 --> 0:31:31,6
But the original sewer system,
a Victorian labyrinth of 450 miles
of interconnecting tunnels,


434
0:31:31,6 --> 0:31:33,48
still serves the city above.


435
0:31:33,48 --> 0:31:38,2
And just like that other Victorian
innovation, the London Underground,


436
0:31:38,2 --> 0:31:41,12
the sewers are struggling to cope.


437
0:31:41,12 --> 0:31:46,52
The arteries of the megacity
are clogging up.


438
0:31:46,52 --> 0:31:53,96
I came into television to start with
because I was looking for glamour.


439
0:31:53,96 --> 0:31:55,76
HE LAUGHS
Now you've got it!


440
0:31:55,76 --> 0:31:59,0
'Rob Smith's one of 39 flushers


441
0:31:59,0 --> 0:32:4,6
'who maintain Central London's
sewer network, and they do it
the old-fashioned way - by hand.'


442
0:32:4,6 --> 0:32:9,8
Are you ready to go then?
Ready to go. Come this way.


443
0:32:9,8 --> 0:32:13,6
Here we go.


444
0:32:13,6 --> 0:32:16,8
Here it is.


445
0:32:16,8 --> 0:32:23,24
It smells exactly as you expect.
I don't have to describe it.


446
0:32:23,24 --> 0:32:29,8
The Victorian sewer system
was built when London
was a mere toddler of a megacity,


447
0:32:29,8 --> 0:32:31,84
home to only 2.5 million people.


448
0:32:31,84 --> 0:32:37,0
150 years later,
it has to deal with the end product
of at least ten million.


449
0:32:37,0 --> 0:32:40,2
The biggest headache for Rob
and the small army of flushers


450
0:32:40,2 --> 0:32:43,4
is not just what
all those millions eat,


451
0:32:43,4 --> 0:32:48,0
but what it's cooked in, too.


452
0:32:48,0 --> 0:32:49,76
Wow.


453
0:32:49,76 --> 0:32:51,8
HE CHUCKLES


454
0:32:51,8 --> 0:32:55,2
Yeah. So, that's fat? That's fat.


455
0:32:55,2 --> 0:32:58,6
Where does it come from?


456
0:32:58,6 --> 0:33:1,4
About a couple of miles up
in that direction.


457
0:33:1,4 --> 0:33:3,84
We've got Leicester Square,
Trafalgar Square.


458
0:33:3,84 --> 0:33:9,2
So, is this fat from restaurants
and kebab shops and so on?


459
0:33:9,2 --> 0:33:12,6
Exactly. Yeah.
Yeah, that's where it comes from.


460
0:33:12,6 --> 0:33:16,8
So when we talk about, you know, you
eat too much fat, too many burgers
and chips,


461
0:33:16,8 --> 0:33:20,6
your arteries get furred up...
Same with the sewers.


462
0:33:20,6 --> 0:33:24,72
This is London's arteries getting
furred up with fat. That's right.


463
0:33:24,72 --> 0:33:30,2
It's astonishing
and very, very disgusting, as well!


464
0:33:30,2 --> 0:33:32,8
I suppose we'd better go
and take a closer look.


465
0:33:32,8 --> 0:33:35,88
I think we ought to
now we're down here.


466
0:33:35,88 --> 0:33:39,52
WATER GUSHES


467
0:33:39,52 --> 0:33:41,72
That is truly foul.


468
0:33:41,72 --> 0:33:45,0
Really hard. That's old fat, that.


469
0:33:45,0 --> 0:33:54,96
Oh, right. We'll go back up the top.
Back up again? Yeah.


470
0:33:54,96 --> 0:34:0,72
There we go. That's the product
of our fast-food burger-eating,


471
0:34:0,72 --> 0:34:3,8
chip-eating, kebab-eating lifestyle.


472
0:34:3,8 --> 0:34:7,0
Solid fat.


473
0:34:7,0 --> 0:34:10,36
Choking up the sewers
underneath London.


474
0:34:10,36 --> 0:34:13,6
Now I want to wipe my nose
but, on the whole,


475
0:34:13,6 --> 0:34:17,52
I think I won't.


476
0:34:17,52 --> 0:34:22,0
Across the globe, the consequences
of the waste crisis in Mexico City


477
0:34:22,0 --> 0:34:26,8
are on an epic and al fresco scale
compared to London's sewers.


478
0:34:26,8 --> 0:34:29,96
This is what's known
as the Grand Canal.


479
0:34:29,96 --> 0:34:34,44
No gondolas, no palazzos
and no tourists either.


480
0:34:34,44 --> 0:34:38,8
It's a hundred-mile-long open sewer,


481
0:34:38,8 --> 0:34:44,4
designed to transport waste water
to the central sewage works.


482
0:34:44,4 --> 0:34:48,0
I fear it is time for me
to experience sewer cleaning


483
0:34:48,0 --> 0:34:55,0
on an altogether different level.


484
0:34:55,0 --> 0:34:58,4
I'm told that at this moment,


485
0:34:58,4 --> 0:35:3,76
clever people
are working on a form of television
that you can actually smell.


486
0:35:3,76 --> 0:35:9,24
And all I can say is, be very glad
they haven't got there yet!


487
0:35:9,24 --> 0:35:15,28
The reek here is unbelievable.


488
0:35:15,28 --> 0:35:18,6
These canals were designed
100 years ago


489
0:35:18,6 --> 0:35:22,68
to handle the run-off
from Mexico City's rainy season.


490
0:35:22,68 --> 0:35:24,96
But their history
has been overtaken.


491
0:35:24,96 --> 0:35:27,76
The modern mania
for casually throwing things away


492
0:35:27,76 --> 0:35:31,4
reaches its inevitable consequence
here.


493
0:35:31,4 --> 0:35:42,6
Clogged and festering, almost
everything gets tossed in here.


494
0:35:42,6 --> 0:35:47,8
And the truth is, we are becalmed
on a sea of plastic,


495
0:35:47,8 --> 0:35:52,0
dead dogs - there's one just there -
and much worse.


496
0:35:52,0 --> 0:35:56,0
I am, quite literally,
up a certain creek


497
0:35:56,0 --> 0:35:59,4
with a paddle,
which is doing me no good.


498
0:35:59,4 --> 0:36:4,2
I won't give you the statistics
about how much excrement the average
human produces each year,


499
0:36:4,2 --> 0:36:7,2
you don't want to know,
except that it's lots,


500
0:36:7,2 --> 0:36:11,0
or as the scientists would say,
lots and lots.


501
0:36:11,0 --> 0:36:14,4
And so a city the size of this one,
with nearly 20 million people,


502
0:36:14,4 --> 0:36:20,6
produces the equivalent
of an Olympic swimming pool-full
of excrement every minute,


503
0:36:20,6 --> 0:36:24,8
and something has to happen to it.


504
0:36:24,8 --> 0:36:30,56
But blockages can't be got rid of
from the relative safety of a boat,
or with a spade,


505
0:36:30,56 --> 0:36:32,4
as in London's ancient sewers.


506
0:36:32,4 --> 0:36:38,16
This calls for someone
with a diver's license, a cool head
and a very strong stomach.


507
0:36:38,16 --> 0:36:44,32
When it comes to unclogging,
Ricardo Vazquez is the go-to guy.


508
0:36:44,32 --> 0:36:46,44
Is it dangerous,
what you're doing now?


509
0:36:46,44 --> 0:36:50,24
HE SPEAKS SPANISH


510
0:36:50,24 --> 0:36:57,44
TRANSLATION: It's dangerous because
of all the pollution in the water.
Also because of the glass and nails.


511
0:36:57,44 --> 0:37:0,68
Is there anything
you wish you hadn't found?


512
0:37:0,68 --> 0:37:3,16
Dead bodies.


513
0:37:3,16 --> 0:37:5,64
Two or three every year.


514
0:37:5,64 --> 0:37:9,96
I hope you have a good day today.
I hope it's not too bad.


515
0:37:9,96 --> 0:37:12,56
I should say that Health and Safety


516
0:37:12,56 --> 0:37:15,24
have insisted
that I can't go down there.


517
0:37:15,24 --> 0:37:22,88
And I think, for the first time
in my life, I'm thinking,
"Go Health and Safety!"


518
0:37:22,88 --> 0:37:27,2
Once he's submerged,
the only contact Ricardo
will have with the outside world


519
0:37:27,2 --> 0:37:29,12
is via a radio in his suit.


520
0:37:29,12 --> 0:37:38,2
His suit is the only thing between
him and the highly toxic broth.


521
0:37:38,2 --> 0:37:43,0
That's one of the most bizarre
things I've ever seen. I mean...


522
0:37:43,0 --> 0:37:47,68
It's unimaginable,
what he's just lowered himself into.


523
0:37:47,68 --> 0:37:50,12
With glass, nails, sewage


524
0:37:50,12 --> 0:37:55,52
and maybe even the odd
decomposing animal to contend with,
it's a risky operation.


525
0:37:55,52 --> 0:37:58,48
Ricardo now has to dive
to the bottom of the tank


526
0:37:58,48 --> 0:38:1,8
and clear out the filters.


527
0:38:1,8 --> 0:38:4,6
Down there, I'm told
it's completely pitch black.


528
0:38:4,6 --> 0:38:6,68
So you can't see anything at all.


529
0:38:6,68 --> 0:38:11,8
What you know is that horrible
things are blocking up the system.


530
0:38:11,8 --> 0:38:14,2
And if they're allowed
to keep blocking it up,


531
0:38:14,2 --> 0:38:23,4
the entire sewage system
starts to malfunction.


532
0:38:23,4 --> 0:38:32,48
There's a metre of just solid trash
at this bottom of this, as well,
so there's no ground, if you like.


533
0:38:32,48 --> 0:38:37,36
After five minutes,
a radio message comes from the deep.


534
0:38:37,36 --> 0:38:38,84
He's found a tree.


535
0:38:38,84 --> 0:38:42,84
While still submerged,
working by touch alone,


536
0:38:42,84 --> 0:38:46,2
Ricardo sets about
dislodging the offending tree.


537
0:38:46,2 --> 0:38:51,28
I can't think of somebody
who is more useful
to the people of Mexico City


538
0:38:51,28 --> 0:38:57,28
than the man who's just gone
down there.


539
0:38:57,28 --> 0:38:59,6
Blockage dealt with,


540
0:38:59,6 --> 0:39:7,0
Ricardo's winched out for a shower
and a strong dose of disinfectant.


541
0:39:7,0 --> 0:39:10,6
The size of the megacity
food-and-waste footprint


542
0:39:10,6 --> 0:39:13,36
threatens the future of the planet.


543
0:39:13,36 --> 0:39:19,68
But the metropolis has always been
a great engine for innovation
and radical change.


544
0:39:19,68 --> 0:39:24,0
And the solutions aren't all
top-down or about civil engineering.


545
0:39:24,0 --> 0:39:29,6
They can start off deceptively small
and simple.


546
0:39:29,6 --> 0:39:31,64
Cooking oil.


547
0:39:31,64 --> 0:39:33,48
In every city in the world,


548
0:39:33,48 --> 0:39:38,2
this stuff is as common
as cigarette butts and beer cans.
It's everywhere.


549
0:39:38,2 --> 0:39:42,88
Megacities produce millions
of gallons of it all the time


550
0:39:42,88 --> 0:39:46,0
and it's normally seen as a problem.


551
0:39:46,0 --> 0:39:50,48
You've seen what happens
when you stick it down drains
and that is not pretty.


552
0:39:50,48 --> 0:39:54,92
But imagine if it was, in fact,
liquid gold.


553
0:39:54,92 --> 0:39:58,8
An answer to transport problems.


554
0:39:58,8 --> 0:40:1,2
It's a pretty weird idea,


555
0:40:1,2 --> 0:40:5,2
but often, salvation...


556
0:40:5,2 --> 0:40:7,2
is in the detail.


557
0:40:7,2 --> 0:40:10,68
This restaurant has signed up
to a pioneering scheme


558
0:40:10,68 --> 0:40:16,12
that takes all their waste oil,
which would simply get poured away,
adding to London's sewer blockages,


559
0:40:16,12 --> 0:40:19,12
and transforms it
into something useful.


560
0:40:19,12 --> 0:40:22,12
And it's all thanks to this man.


561
0:40:22,12 --> 0:40:26,72
Every day, Nigel Jewison and his
team do their restaurant round,


562
0:40:26,72 --> 0:40:31,4
picking up drums of dirty, used oil.


563
0:40:31,4 --> 0:40:34,92
But the HQ for Operation Cooking Oil
is here,


564
0:40:34,92 --> 0:40:37,0
down in the heart of old London.


565
0:40:37,0 --> 0:40:40,28
Crammed in among
the grimy railway arches,


566
0:40:40,28 --> 0:40:45,44
this mini refinery is a magnet
for London's cabbies.


567
0:40:45,44 --> 0:40:50,48
Hundreds of them queue here
every week to get their fill.


568
0:40:50,48 --> 0:40:54,36
You can see the lovely quality
of that oil. That's, er...


569
0:40:54,36 --> 0:40:57,72
And this is how we like it.
Classy restaurant, classy oil.


570
0:40:57,72 --> 0:41:3,32
That's not always the case, though.
There's a few restaurants I won't
eat at, even with their good names,


571
0:41:3,32 --> 0:41:5,2
after seeing their waste oil.


572
0:41:5,2 --> 0:41:9,8
So this is a very straightforward
filtration system.


573
0:41:9,8 --> 0:41:13,12
Dirty oil becomes less dirty oil,


574
0:41:13,12 --> 0:41:17,0
sits in these tanks
and becomes clean-ish oil,


575
0:41:17,0 --> 0:41:19,12
and then, eventually, clean oil.


576
0:41:19,12 --> 0:41:24,56
At which point, it can be made
into fuel for the taxis.


577
0:41:24,56 --> 0:41:29,4
Hiya, Pete. How's it going?
Busy on the streets?
It's OK. It could be better!


578
0:41:29,4 --> 0:41:32,8
It always can. Always better.
Hello there. Hiya.


579
0:41:32,8 --> 0:41:35,64
Have you been doing it for a while,
using the biodiesel?


580
0:41:35,64 --> 0:41:39,2
Is it good for you,
as a taxi driver? Fantastic. Why?


581
0:41:39,2 --> 0:41:42,48
It's cheaper, for a start.
It's cleaner. Yeah.


582
0:41:42,48 --> 0:41:48,0
With the new legislation coming on
the older cabs, it could be a way
to get us to last a bit longer.


583
0:41:48,0 --> 0:41:51,68
Do you notice the lack of
black smoke and smells?


584
0:41:51,68 --> 0:41:56,48
Definitely. But because it smells
of fish and chips,
you're always hungry!


585
0:41:56,48 --> 0:42:2,48
If you go to classier restaurants,
it would smell of garlic and
all sorts of stuff. Garlicky cabs.


586
0:42:2,48 --> 0:42:7,16
One of my dreams when I first
started up, when people started
talking about smells,


587
0:42:7,16 --> 0:42:12,2
was that, if I could collect
all the Chinese restaurants, on
another round, Indian restaurants,


588
0:42:12,2 --> 0:42:16,8
we could open up a filling station
with Chinese-smelling fuel,
Indian-smelling fuel.


589
0:42:16,8 --> 0:42:20,36
So you could choose your
nationality of fuel!


590
0:42:20,36 --> 0:42:22,4
It'd be brilliant, wouldn't it?


591
0:42:22,4 --> 0:42:32,4
But it's good news for you guys.
I think it's very good. It's a shame
they can't put it in buses. Yes.


592
0:42:32,4 --> 0:42:37,8
Coming to the amount of cooking oil
in the city centre, around London,


593
0:42:37,8 --> 0:42:42,6
how widespread could this be
in fuelling taxis, fuelling cars?


594
0:42:42,6 --> 0:42:47,6
If we can collect all the oil
in London, we could probably fuel
all the taxis,


595
0:42:47,6 --> 0:42:54,4
which would be a fantastic thing.
Amazing. It would be.


596
0:42:54,4 --> 0:43:0,32
If a great city like London had to
rely on the elected politicians
and the planners for its solutions,


597
0:43:0,32 --> 0:43:5,8
I think it would be
a much less interesting
and more constipated sort of place.


598
0:43:5,8 --> 0:43:9,32
Very often, the big ideas are found


599
0:43:9,32 --> 0:43:13,4
in the little nooks
and side streets of the city.


600
0:43:13,4 --> 0:43:17,2
And the job of the politicians
is to get hold of those ideas


601
0:43:17,2 --> 0:43:19,8
and, using their taxes
and their rules,


602
0:43:19,8 --> 0:43:28,92
to ensure that they then spread
and seed much more widely.


603
0:43:28,92 --> 0:43:31,72
Putting old cooking oil to good use
is one thing,


604
0:43:31,72 --> 0:43:35,4
but what about all the other stuff
we chuck away without a thought?


605
0:43:35,4 --> 0:43:39,2
Well, that ends up here,
in a landfill site.


606
0:43:39,2 --> 0:43:43,6
London is near to the bottom of
the European cities landfill league,


607
0:43:43,6 --> 0:43:49,64
only recycling about 25 percent
of its waste.


608
0:43:49,64 --> 0:43:54,2
And it's running out of space
to dump its growing, growling


609
0:43:54,2 --> 0:43:56,88
mountains of rubbish.


610
0:43:56,88 --> 0:44:1,88
The truth is that we in the West
throw away far too much.


611
0:44:1,88 --> 0:44:5,16
I do. You probably do, as well.


612
0:44:5,16 --> 0:44:8,4
And when we think about it,
we may feel a bit guilty.


613
0:44:8,4 --> 0:44:13,4
And increasingly,
we're being kind of mildly bullied


614
0:44:13,4 --> 0:44:17,52
by councils and government
to throw away less.


615
0:44:17,52 --> 0:44:21,4
But when you come
to a place like this,


616
0:44:21,4 --> 0:44:24,24
you realise why.


617
0:44:24,24 --> 0:44:27,4
Perhaps we do have to learn
from those parts of the world


618
0:44:27,4 --> 0:44:40,2
where they recycle everything
they possibly can.


619
0:44:40,2 --> 0:44:44,4
In Dhaka, it isn't a case
of recycling with a conscience.


620
0:44:44,4 --> 0:44:48,68
This is the extreme end
and it's driven by necessity.


621
0:44:48,68 --> 0:44:54,36
Here, entire communities
are completely reliant
on salvaging the scraps,


622
0:44:54,36 --> 0:44:56,2
the megacity's leftovers,


623
0:44:56,2 --> 0:45:1,88
to carve out some kind of living.


624
0:45:1,88 --> 0:45:6,2
It's sort of like when a large
animal is killed in the jungle


625
0:45:6,2 --> 0:45:9,12
and the carcass
is picked completely.


626
0:45:9,12 --> 0:45:12,2
And this is an urban version
of the same thing.


627
0:45:12,2 --> 0:45:18,84
Rather than microbes
doing the picking, it's little boys.


628
0:45:18,84 --> 0:45:23,36
Dhaka's main rubbish dump
is the size of a small town,


629
0:45:23,36 --> 0:45:26,28
and a town with its own people.


630
0:45:26,28 --> 0:45:30,0
Here, anything that can be
melted down or reshaped and reused


631
0:45:30,0 --> 0:45:33,28
is bagged up
and carted off to be resold.


632
0:45:33,28 --> 0:45:36,28
And when I say anything,
I really do mean anything.


633
0:45:36,28 --> 0:45:38,8
What are you looking for?


634
0:45:38,8 --> 0:45:40,12
TRANSLATOR SPEAKS BENGALI


635
0:45:40,12 --> 0:45:46,64
Plates, cartons, bottles. Plastic...
Plastic. I can understand that.


636
0:45:46,64 --> 0:45:49,6
And what does she do with them
when she's got them?


637
0:45:49,6 --> 0:45:51,84
SHE SPEAKS BENGALI


638
0:45:51,84 --> 0:45:54,2
TRANSLATION:
Takes it to the shops and sell it.


639
0:45:54,2 --> 0:45:57,0
Everything there
is scrunched and dirty.


640
0:45:57,0 --> 0:46:0,0
These are not bottles
that could ordinarily be recycled.


641
0:46:0,0 --> 0:46:4,2
This is absolutely
the leavings of the leavings,
the scraps of the scraps,


642
0:46:4,2 --> 0:46:5,8
the final pickings


643
0:46:5,8 --> 0:46:8,48
after everybody else
further up the food chain


644
0:46:8,48 --> 0:46:12,0
has taken what's worth something.


645
0:46:12,0 --> 0:46:16,92
Here, even the insidious plastic
shopping bag is given another life,


646
0:46:16,92 --> 0:46:20,64
melted down and recycled.


647
0:46:20,64 --> 0:46:23,52
In a sort of most unpleasant way,
I suppose,


648
0:46:23,52 --> 0:46:25,56
poverty is very efficient.


649
0:46:25,56 --> 0:46:31,4
Everything is used.


650
0:46:31,4 --> 0:46:33,84
This might seem like
a rather hardcore solution


651
0:46:33,84 --> 0:46:36,48
to the waste problem
of the metropolis,


652
0:46:36,48 --> 0:46:41,6
but perhaps the Dhaka necessity
for re-use and recycling


653
0:46:41,6 --> 0:46:44,4
has lessons for us at home.


654
0:46:44,4 --> 0:46:49,2
The longer all of us live in the
city, the more disconnected we get.


655
0:46:49,2 --> 0:46:52,48
More of our food is processed
and pre-packaged.


656
0:46:52,48 --> 0:46:56,16
It arrives in cartons
and little plastic boxes.


657
0:46:56,16 --> 0:47:1,0
And instead of being sure
about when something has gone off


658
0:47:1,0 --> 0:47:4,8
and it's no longer acceptable,


659
0:47:4,8 --> 0:47:7,0
we rely on those rather timid
sell-by dates.


660
0:47:7,0 --> 0:47:9,68
"If in doubt, chuck it out."


661
0:47:9,68 --> 0:47:19,52
Which is a wasteful way of living
and of eating.


662
0:47:19,52 --> 0:47:22,32
Dinner with Simon and Fran,


663
0:47:22,32 --> 0:47:25,8
another pair
of metropolis innovators.


664
0:47:25,8 --> 0:47:27,96
They call themselves freegans.


665
0:47:27,96 --> 0:47:31,2
There's bread here.
That's £1.30 for that.


666
0:47:31,2 --> 0:47:37,4
£1.30 that'd cost in the shop.
It's good bakery bread.
Nothing wrong with that at all.


667
0:47:37,4 --> 0:47:38,8
Large whites.


668
0:47:38,8 --> 0:47:42,76
Can you find a date on there?
The 16th. That's yesterday.


669
0:47:42,76 --> 0:47:44,84
Bread doesn't just go off overnight.


670
0:47:44,84 --> 0:47:47,44
What are these? Diet Pepsi.


671
0:47:47,44 --> 0:47:51,0
I'll just pass them to you.
There's a lot of it.


672
0:47:51,0 --> 0:47:55,0
You'll be belching for a week! Yeah!


673
0:47:55,0 --> 0:47:59,4
It makes me feel gaseous
and horrible!


674
0:47:59,4 --> 0:48:3,12
Just look at this!


675
0:48:3,12 --> 0:48:7,32
Twice a week for the past two years,
Simon and Fran
have sifted through the skips


676
0:48:7,32 --> 0:48:11,72
of the back of London's high-street
stores and they've yet to go hungry.


677
0:48:11,72 --> 0:48:15,6
Apart from the fact that
it's good news for you,
does it make you angry?


678
0:48:15,6 --> 0:48:17,8
It does. Because of the waste.


679
0:48:17,8 --> 0:48:23,2
Because there's people in the world
who are starving, and we have an
abundance and we throw it away.


680
0:48:23,2 --> 0:48:26,0
What's that? Hold on a minute.


681
0:48:26,0 --> 0:48:30,8
What have you got? Ha-ha!
Chocolates. Chocolate. OK.


682
0:48:30,8 --> 0:48:32,76
Not bad.


683
0:48:32,76 --> 0:48:35,8
Why would that be thrown away?
I have no idea. What's the...?


684
0:48:35,8 --> 0:48:40,4
February.
Chocolates don't just go off.


685
0:48:40,4 --> 0:48:45,8
'I don't generally make a habit
of routing through rubbish bins,
and it does feel a little odd.


686
0:48:45,8 --> 0:48:49,8
'Legally speaking, however,
what's thrown away is fair game.'


687
0:48:49,8 --> 0:48:54,96
And so to the getaway vehicle!
THEY LAUGH


688
0:48:54,96 --> 0:48:58,44
What's the range of stuff
that you're picking up?


689
0:48:58,44 --> 0:49:1,92
Meats. A lot of meat that we find.
Yeah. Cheese. Milk.


690
0:49:1,92 --> 0:49:3,4
Yoghurts. Yoghurts.


691
0:49:3,4 --> 0:49:8,0
What would you say to people who
say, "It's past its best-by date?"


692
0:49:8,0 --> 0:49:10,6
Use your common sense
and have a look at it.


693
0:49:10,6 --> 0:49:14,8
Best-by date, obviously it's saying,
"If you want it perfect,
eat it before then."


694
0:49:14,8 --> 0:49:18,44
But, you know,
the food's still perfectly edible.


695
0:49:18,44 --> 0:49:22,0
Have you ever been unable
to feed yourselves


696
0:49:22,0 --> 0:49:25,2
by freegan...
lifting of stuff out of bins?


697
0:49:25,2 --> 0:49:27,4
Not in London. No.


698
0:49:27,4 --> 0:49:34,2
There's too much abundance and
waste to not be able to do it. Yeah.


699
0:49:34,2 --> 0:49:38,8
Simon and Fran's fight
against the waste footprint
is only half the battle.


700
0:49:38,8 --> 0:49:43,32
Managing to work out
how to supply a metropolis
with all the resources it needs


701
0:49:43,32 --> 0:49:47,32
requires an equally smart way
of thinking.


702
0:49:47,32 --> 0:49:52,8
Food often travels
thousands of miles
before it arrives on our plates.


703
0:49:52,8 --> 0:49:55,36
It's inefficient, it's wasteful.


704
0:49:55,36 --> 0:50:6,0
But to find a solution, perhaps
we need to travel back in time.


705
0:50:6,0 --> 0:50:11,8
Away, at last,
from the madness of the megacity.


706
0:50:11,8 --> 0:50:17,6
Birdsong, nature...
Back in the countryside.


707
0:50:17,6 --> 0:50:20,6
Except that
I'm not in the countryside.


708
0:50:20,6 --> 0:50:24,28
I am inside Mexico City


709
0:50:24,28 --> 0:50:29,2
and we're on our way to see
its famous floating farms.


710
0:50:29,2 --> 0:50:33,68
They go right the way back as an
idea to the original Aztec city,


711
0:50:33,68 --> 0:50:36,44
which was built on a lake.


712
0:50:36,44 --> 0:50:40,88
And the way they fed themselves was,
the created little floating islands,


713
0:50:40,88 --> 0:50:48,6
and on those islands, they grew
the plants they needed to eat.


714
0:50:48,6 --> 0:50:53,32
In the 16th century, Mexico City,
or Tenochtitlan,


715
0:50:53,32 --> 0:50:55,8
was the largest city in the world.


716
0:50:55,8 --> 0:50:59,6
The Aztecs' floating islands,
or farms, were vast rafts


717
0:50:59,6 --> 0:51:4,4
made out of reeds,
fertilised with mud from the lake,
and organic waste.


718
0:51:4,4 --> 0:51:9,12
The result was highly productive.
An amazing two-thirds
of the city's food


719
0:51:9,12 --> 0:51:13,12
was grown within the city limits.


720
0:51:13,12 --> 0:51:16,16
DOG BARKS


721
0:51:16,16 --> 0:51:18,2
Now we're in the 21st century,


722
0:51:18,2 --> 0:51:22,28
one of the questions is,
could we go right the way back?


723
0:51:22,28 --> 0:51:29,6
Could we learn to grow more of our
own food actually inside the city?


724
0:51:29,6 --> 0:51:33,16
Pedro Castillo
is keeping traditions alive


725
0:51:33,16 --> 0:51:39,4
from before the Spanish Conquest.


726
0:51:39,4 --> 0:51:41,76
It's a beautiful. Claro.


727
0:51:41,76 --> 0:51:45,4
His fertile little holding
of vegetables


728
0:51:45,4 --> 0:51:49,2
is home to livestock and
an abundance of fruit and vegetables,


729
0:51:49,2 --> 0:51:52,32
which are all sold back
to downtown Mexico City


730
0:51:52,32 --> 0:51:54,56
a couple of miles away.


731
0:51:54,56 --> 0:51:58,16
Why did they start to grow the food
on the island?


732
0:51:58,16 --> 0:52:1,52
And is it a good way of growing
food, to have a floating farm?


733
0:52:1,52 --> 0:52:5,8
HE SPEAKS SPANISH


734
0:52:5,8 --> 0:52:8,0
TRANSLATION:
It was more about necessity.


735
0:52:8,0 --> 0:52:14,28
It was the lack of space, the lack
of room to cultivate their crops
that brought them here.


736
0:52:14,28 --> 0:52:17,52
And then they noticed
it was very good for farming.


737
0:52:17,52 --> 0:52:26,6
So, you yourself,
what do you grow here
and where do you sell what you grow?


738
0:52:26,6 --> 0:52:29,84
They grow lettuce, spinach, tomato,


739
0:52:29,84 --> 0:52:31,76
corn, radish.


740
0:52:31,76 --> 0:52:33,88
< HE SPEAKS SPANISH


741
0:52:33,88 --> 0:52:37,68
Normally, they sell it in the market
here in Xochimilco,


742
0:52:37,68 --> 0:52:43,32
but right now, they're selling to
very selective restaurants
in Mexico City. Very good.


743
0:52:43,32 --> 0:52:49,4
Pedro makes a mean tamale, that's a
kind of corn dough served in leaves.


744
0:52:49,4 --> 0:52:50,68
Mm. Very good.


745
0:52:50,68 --> 0:52:56,16
And like all good farmers, Pedro does
a nice line in home brew, as well.


746
0:52:56,16 --> 0:53:0,2
This is a traditional tipple
which is made out of cactus sap.


747
0:53:0,2 --> 0:53:6,28
It's got a kind of caramel taste.
And it would be extremely rude
not to sample it properly.


748
0:53:6,28 --> 0:53:7,92
It is damn fine!


749
0:53:7,92 --> 0:53:16,2
Mm! Very good.
HE SPEAKS SPANISH


750
0:53:16,2 --> 0:53:26,12
TRANSLATION: You're offering it
to the mother earth.


751
0:53:26,12 --> 0:53:29,56
Of course, this is very much
a Mexico City story.


752
0:53:29,56 --> 0:53:34,52
You don't get tamales
and floating farms most places.


753
0:53:34,52 --> 0:53:36,56
But perhaps there's a lesson here.


754
0:53:36,56 --> 0:53:39,8
Because although
they're built by humans,


755
0:53:39,8 --> 0:53:42,4
cities depend on nature.


756
0:53:42,4 --> 0:53:45,4
We're inside nature,
we're part of nature.


757
0:53:45,4 --> 0:53:51,0
And the great cities that we build
thrive or die


758
0:53:51,0 --> 0:53:59,4
because of the natural world
around them.


759
0:53:59,4 --> 0:54:3,6
We tear up the past
and we ignore nature at our peril.


760
0:54:3,6 --> 0:54:8,2
Just like Mexico City, London
used to grow a substantial amount
of its own food


761
0:54:8,2 --> 0:54:11,4
within a few short miles
of the centre.


762
0:54:11,4 --> 0:54:15,6
This fertile farmland,
known as the breadbasket of London,


763
0:54:15,6 --> 0:54:19,84
is better known today
as Heathrow Airport,


764
0:54:19,84 --> 0:54:23,0
where food, very often similar food,


765
0:54:23,0 --> 0:54:28,8
now arrives from South America,
Africa, Asia.


766
0:54:28,8 --> 0:54:32,4
I'm not saying we should rip up
and plough what we've built over,


767
0:54:32,4 --> 0:54:37,88
but we do need to be more clever
about how we use what we've got.


768
0:54:37,88 --> 0:54:43,0
If the future shape of metropolis
seems to be ever more dense
and increasingly high rise,


769
0:54:43,0 --> 0:54:49,4
then, maybe, some of the answers
to feeding the city
have to be urban ones.


770
0:54:49,4 --> 0:54:54,52
For decades, people have imagined
a science-fiction future.


771
0:54:54,52 --> 0:54:57,8
A vertical city
and farms in the sky.


772
0:54:57,8 --> 0:55:0,2
It's not entirely far-fetched.


773
0:55:0,2 --> 0:55:10,2
Architects are already hard at work.


774
0:55:10,2 --> 0:55:14,2
Nearer to hand, inside
this inner-city London terrace,


775
0:55:14,2 --> 0:55:21,92
the seeds of something pretty big
could be growing.


776
0:55:21,92 --> 0:55:27,56
Like most ground-breaking ideas,
they start small.


777
0:55:27,56 --> 0:55:33,56
This is a mini hydroponic
and aquaponic farm.


778
0:55:33,56 --> 0:55:39,0
There is no soil here.
The plants are grown under light,
in mineral solutions and water,


779
0:55:39,0 --> 0:55:44,56
fertilised by fish droppings.


780
0:55:44,56 --> 0:55:48,72
Fresh eggs are laid daily
in a rooftop coop.


781
0:55:48,72 --> 0:55:54,6
I'm under no illusion
that a few salad plants and hens
are going to solve the food crisis,


782
0:55:54,6 --> 0:55:58,4
but think how much neglected space
London has to offer


783
0:55:58,4 --> 0:56:3,76
a whole city of potential
21st century urban farmers.


784
0:56:3,76 --> 0:56:5,68
Farmers like Paul Smith.


785
0:56:5,68 --> 0:56:9,6
Our big plan is to grow food
all around the city,


786
0:56:9,6 --> 0:56:14,36
in warehouses, empty buildings
and old derelict spaces.


787
0:56:14,36 --> 0:56:17,12
When you're growing
inside a building,


788
0:56:17,12 --> 0:56:21,52
the best way to make use
of the space is to grow upwards,
create vertical installations,


789
0:56:21,52 --> 0:56:23,6
layers of food within buildings.


790
0:56:23,6 --> 0:56:27,36
This a movement
happening all around the world
that we hope to be part of.


791
0:56:27,36 --> 0:56:30,56
We're trying to demonstrate
you can get the best of both worlds.


792
0:56:30,56 --> 0:56:33,24
You can have an ecological
food system in the city,


793
0:56:33,24 --> 0:56:38,92
and if you do that,
we'll have a much lower
food footprint for everybody.


794
0:56:38,92 --> 0:56:44,28
If we can get enough people
growing food in cities,
it'll be one part of the picture.


795
0:56:44,28 --> 0:56:47,32
The city has an absolute,
in our view, critical role


796
0:56:47,32 --> 0:56:57,6
in fulfilling the future food needs
of a place like London.


797
0:56:57,6 --> 0:57:1,2
Over the next century,
disasters permitting,


798
0:57:1,2 --> 0:57:4,64
the growth of the megacities
will stretch onwards.


799
0:57:4,64 --> 0:57:9,4
In the last hour, in the time that
it's taken to watch this programme,


800
0:57:9,4 --> 0:57:13,92
7,500 people have moved
from the country to a big city.


801
0:57:13,92 --> 0:57:21,6
In that hour,
the world's slum population
has gone up by 3,000 people.


802
0:57:21,6 --> 0:57:24,68
Shanghai's underground,
already the longest in the world,


803
0:57:24,68 --> 0:57:29,36
will have grown
by a further five metres.


804
0:57:29,36 --> 0:57:33,88
And so is the inexorable rise
and the dominance of the megacity


805
0:57:33,88 --> 0:57:39,76
a cause for despair or hope?


806
0:57:39,76 --> 0:57:42,28
There's no single answer
to any of this.


807
0:57:42,28 --> 0:57:48,4
We need the planners. We need
the Shanghai-sized ambitions.


808
0:57:48,4 --> 0:57:51,24
But we also need
the kick from the streets.


809
0:57:51,24 --> 0:57:54,8
We need the stroppy cyclists,
the backyard innovators,


810
0:57:54,8 --> 0:57:58,76
and the idealistic freegans
trying new ways of living.


811
0:57:58,76 --> 0:58:6,4
Because cities don't belong
to the town hall or the architects
or the commissars.


812
0:58:6,4 --> 0:58:9,6
Cities belong to citizens.


813
0:58:9,6 --> 0:58:13,68
Are they going to be
new urban nightmares


814
0:58:13,68 --> 0:58:18,68
or are they going to be places
where we dream new dreams
and bring them into effect?


815
0:58:18,68 --> 0:58:23,4
Well, that's up to me. And you.
