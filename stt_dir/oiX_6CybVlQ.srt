0:0:4,93 --> 0:0:7,4
MALE SPEAKER: What's going
on back there?


3
0:0:7,4 --> 0:0:12,0
CHRIS CHRISTENSON: That's old
Chief Two Beers, little


4
0:0:12,0 --> 0:0:13,726
dismount before the trip.


5
0:0:13,726 --> 0:0:17,67



6
0:0:17,67 --> 0:0:21,614
Hopefully they're done
before it gets dark.


7
0:0:21,614 --> 0:0:23,586
Just busted him.


8
0:0:23,586 --> 0:0:47,77
[MUSIC PLAYING]


9
0:0:47,77 --> 0:0:50,256
BRAD GERLACH: He calls me and
says, hey man, let's go do


10
0:0:50,256 --> 0:0:52,34
some motorcycle riding.


11
0:0:52,34 --> 0:0:53,4
Bring it on, dude.


12
0:0:53,4 --> 0:0:54,42
I'm ready to go.


13
0:0:54,42 --> 0:1:24,676
[MUSIC PLAYING]


14
0:1:24,676 --> 0:1:26,66
How do you-- hey, how do you
[INAUDIBLE] gas [INAUDIBLE]?


15
0:1:26,66 --> 0:1:28,644
CHRIS CHRISTENSON: Lefty
loosey, righty tighty.


16
0:1:28,644 --> 0:1:31,15
BRAD GERLACH: Yeah, I know that,
but I mean did you press


17
0:1:31,15 --> 0:1:32,93
it down or something?


18
0:1:32,93 --> 0:1:34,571
Great, got to get
it on footage.


19
0:1:34,571 --> 0:1:35,834
Hey, hey, hey, hey, Chris.


20
0:1:35,834 --> 0:1:38,31
How do you get the gas
tank open, man?


21
0:1:38,31 --> 0:1:39,88
CHRIS CHRISTENSON:
You just do.


22
0:1:39,88 --> 0:1:40,94
BRAD GERLACH: Spin it?


23
0:1:40,94 --> 0:1:42,66
I looked at a couple
of his boards.


24
0:1:42,66 --> 0:1:44,136
I was like, oh man, this
guy looks like he


25
0:1:44,136 --> 0:1:44,88
knows how to shape.


26
0:1:44,88 --> 0:1:46,912
I just called him up to--


27
0:1:46,912 --> 0:1:48,63
hey, I want to get a board.


28
0:1:48,63 --> 0:1:49,93
CHRIS CHRISTENSON: The
conversation was probably like


29
0:1:49,93 --> 0:1:52,53
five minutes on the phone before
I even knew who he was.


30
0:1:52,53 --> 0:1:54,25
BRAD GERLACH: When he really
knew it was me after a while,


31
0:1:54,25 --> 0:1:55,3
I was like, oh shit.


32
0:1:55,3 --> 0:1:56,21
Sorry, dude.


33
0:1:56,21 --> 0:1:57,49
CHRIS CHRISTENSON: What was
your last name again?


34
0:1:57,49 --> 0:1:58,41
He's all, Gerlach.


35
0:1:58,41 --> 0:2:2,21
I'm like, oh OK, OK.


36
0:2:2,21 --> 0:2:5,57
BRAD GERLACH: He's kind of
a grump, you know, so--


37
0:2:5,57 --> 0:2:7,65
He's [GROWLING], you know?


38
0:2:7,65 --> 0:2:10,38
CHRIS CHRISTENSON: It's a big
commitment to sponsor


39
0:2:10,38 --> 0:2:11,735
someone like Brad.


40
0:2:11,735 --> 0:2:13,32
These guys are like
50 boards a year.


41
0:2:13,32 --> 0:2:15,73
And I don't have those cards
in my deck right now.


42
0:2:15,73 --> 0:2:17,88
BRAD GERLACH: Oh, we just ended
up becoming friends.


43
0:2:17,88 --> 0:2:19,73
CHRIS CHRISTENSON: Friends are
first to me anyway, so--


44
0:2:19,73 --> 0:2:22,34
Brad seems like a
complete nut.


45
0:2:22,34 --> 0:2:24,7
And he is a complete nut.


46
0:2:24,7 --> 0:2:27,17
And he's always a good
time, and you never


47
0:2:27,17 --> 0:2:29,726
know what to expect.


48
0:2:29,726 --> 0:2:33,14
BRAD GERLACH: Those are called
"foors," fake doors.


49
0:2:33,14 --> 0:2:35,108
Do you ever do that
with words?


50
0:2:35,108 --> 0:2:37,568
You put two words together
like sweaty


51
0:2:37,568 --> 0:2:39,536
balls, "swalls." Woo!


52
0:2:39,536 --> 0:2:46,916



53
0:2:46,916 --> 0:2:50,86
"Swalls!"


54
0:2:50,86 --> 0:2:53,355
The exciting part was that we're
going to meet in New


55
0:2:53,355 --> 0:2:57,1
York, pick the bikes up in New
York City, and then head up


56
0:2:57,1 --> 0:2:58,2
north to New England.


57
0:2:58,2 --> 0:3:0,15
And I'm always looking
for waves.


58
0:3:0,15 --> 0:3:3,1
And I'm always in some car,
boat, or airplane.


59
0:3:3,1 --> 0:3:5,71
And the most comfortable way to
go looking for waves is on


60
0:3:5,71 --> 0:3:7,82
motorcycle, for sure.


61
0:3:7,82 --> 0:3:11,71
It's really fun to cruise with
one of your best buds.


62
0:3:11,71 --> 0:3:13,6
CHRIS CHRISTENSON: Obviously
we have surfing in common.


63
0:3:13,6 --> 0:3:15,33
But when we get together, it's
kind of like the last thing we


64
0:3:15,33 --> 0:3:16,58
usually talk about.


65
0:3:16,58 --> 0:3:19,75



66
0:3:19,75 --> 0:3:22,59
BRAD GERLACH: Think about when
we first got going in New


67
0:3:22,59 --> 0:3:25,7
York, couple times driving
along, and then all of a


68
0:3:25,7 --> 0:3:26,38
sudden going like--


69
0:3:26,38 --> 0:3:29,77
I had a couple of visions of
eating it and I was like, OK


70
0:3:29,77 --> 0:3:30,65
just let it go.


71
0:3:30,65 --> 0:3:31,9
Let it go.


72
0:3:31,9 --> 0:3:35,1
Because it's just
like [SIGHING].


73
0:3:35,1 --> 0:3:35,75
Think about it.


74
0:3:35,75 --> 0:3:37,11
You can just eat it so easily.


75
0:3:37,11 --> 0:3:38,36
You're just like, splatter.


76
0:3:38,36 --> 0:3:41,65



77
0:3:41,65 --> 0:3:43,54
Hey, cheers.


78
0:3:43,54 --> 0:3:44,862
Here's to not eating
shit, huh?


79
0:3:44,862 --> 0:3:51,585



80
0:3:51,585 --> 0:3:54,12
That guy just threw a cigarette
butt at you.


81
0:3:54,12 --> 0:3:56,0
[INAUDIBLE]


82
0:3:56,0 --> 0:3:58,57
Welcome to the Hamptons.


83
0:3:58,57 --> 0:3:59,56
CHRIS CHRISTENSON: This
guy needs to ride


84
0:3:59,56 --> 0:4:0,41
a motorcycle backwards.


85
0:4:0,41 --> 0:4:1,59
Look at that hair.


86
0:4:1,59 --> 0:4:2,26
BRAD GERLACH: Which guy?


87
0:4:2,26 --> 0:4:3,7
CHRIS CHRISTENSON: Right here.


88
0:4:3,7 --> 0:4:4,38
BRAD GERLACH: What?


89
0:4:4,38 --> 0:4:5,55
That's who you're
talking about.


90
0:4:5,55 --> 0:4:6,63
That's who he's talking about.


91
0:4:6,63 --> 0:4:8,4
CHRIS CHRISTENSON: No,
there's another one.


92
0:4:8,4 --> 0:4:10,62
BRAD GERLACH: There's
another one?


93
0:4:10,62 --> 0:4:11,205
The guy with the--


94
0:4:11,205 --> 0:4:11,47
oh.


95
0:4:11,47 --> 0:4:12,16
What?


96
0:4:12,16 --> 0:4:14,72
The guy with the blonde hair?


97
0:4:14,72 --> 0:4:16,68
Now he stopped talking and
looked over and said--


98
0:4:16,68 --> 0:4:18,455
CHRIS CHRISTENSON: Yeah,
we're talking to you.


99
0:4:18,455 --> 0:4:21,279
What the fuck you want?


100
0:4:21,279 --> 0:4:22,25
BRAD GERLACH: We're just
wondering where we


101
0:4:22,25 --> 0:4:23,86
could get the same--


102
0:4:23,86 --> 0:4:25,7
is that a beanie?


103
0:4:25,7 --> 0:4:27,17
Because that's cool shit, man.


104
0:4:27,17 --> 0:4:27,73
I need that.


105
0:4:27,73 --> 0:4:28,216
I need that.


106
0:4:28,216 --> 0:4:29,466
I need that.


107
0:4:29,466 --> 0:4:44,28



108
0:4:44,28 --> 0:4:47,5
CHRIS CHRISTENSON: There she
is, the mighty Atlantic.


109
0:4:47,5 --> 0:4:49,16
BRAD GERLACH: Oh, shit.


110
0:4:49,16 --> 0:4:50,41
Pumping.


111
0:4:50,41 --> 0:4:53,23



112
0:4:53,23 --> 0:4:55,4
CHRIS CHRISTENSON: Think we're
going to surf this whole trip?


113
0:4:55,4 --> 0:4:58,9
BRAD GERLACH: Oh, look
at that little--


114
0:4:58,9 --> 0:4:59,34
maybe low tide.


115
0:4:59,34 --> 0:5:1,902



116
0:5:1,902 --> 0:5:3,4
CHRIS CHRISTENSON: There's
definitely a swell.


117
0:5:3,4 --> 0:5:5,266
Those tides are so high.


118
0:5:5,266 --> 0:5:6,516
BRAD GERLACH: Yeah.


119
0:5:6,516 --> 0:5:8,92



120
0:5:8,92 --> 0:5:10,17
Settle down, would you?


121
0:5:10,17 --> 0:5:13,52



122
0:5:13,52 --> 0:5:15,14
CHRIS CHRISTENSON: If we can
find it where the beach maybe


123
0:5:15,14 --> 0:5:17,53
like goes in and then hooks
around that way, it'll


124
0:5:17,53 --> 0:5:19,6
probably pick up swell.


125
0:5:19,6 --> 0:5:21,87
BRAD GERLACH: We don't have any
surf connection up here.


126
0:5:21,87 --> 0:5:23,53
Like there's enough swell right
now where people are


127
0:5:23,53 --> 0:5:25,68
like, oh god, you could've
come around the corner.


128
0:5:25,68 --> 0:5:28,76
It was was like four feet
and pitching out.


129
0:5:28,76 --> 0:5:31,57



130
0:5:31,57 --> 0:5:33,33
Oh you guys are playing
around a shore break.


131
0:5:33,33 --> 0:5:37,3
Stingy and Doobag are over here
doing four foot aerial


132
0:5:37,3 --> 0:5:41,67
reverse and varials and
shuvits and what not.


133
0:5:41,67 --> 0:5:48,6
Because the waves offer that
kind of playfulness, you know?


134
0:5:48,6 --> 0:5:51,68
CHRIS CHRISTENSON: See
that right there?


135
0:5:51,68 --> 0:5:53,59
BRAD GERLACH: Maybe.


136
0:5:53,59 --> 0:6:9,22
CHRIS CHRISTENSON: Let's go up
another 20 more mansions.


137
0:6:9,22 --> 0:6:10,47
BRAD GERLACH: Chicken!


138
0:6:10,47 --> 0:6:16,64



139
0:6:16,64 --> 0:6:19,22
Honey, I shrunk the kids.


140
0:6:19,22 --> 0:6:20,36
Look at that thing
right there.


141
0:6:20,36 --> 0:6:24,35
Paddling into it, you're
seven inches tall.


142
0:6:24,35 --> 0:6:26,31
You and me are hooting because
that thing feels like it's


143
0:6:26,31 --> 0:6:28,15
about 30 feet.


144
0:6:28,15 --> 0:6:29,15
Look at that right.


145
0:6:29,15 --> 0:6:29,33
Look at it.


146
0:6:29,33 --> 0:6:32,1
Off the bottom, boof into the
lip, around that, we're in


147
0:6:32,1 --> 0:6:32,76
France by supper.


148
0:6:32,76 --> 0:6:34,83
You're on that next one.


149
0:6:34,83 --> 0:6:38,95
Whoa, big cut back, float that
section, come around there.

0:6:38,95 --> 0:6:38,49

151
0:6:38,49 --> 0:6:39,403

155
0:6:41,77 --> 0:6:42,695

156
0:6:42,695 --> 0:6:43,61
Oh god, see.


157
0:6:43,61 --> 0:6:45,3
I told you.


158
0:6:45,3 --> 0:6:47,391
Just around the corner.


159
0:6:47,391 --> 0:6:51,12
I neglected to mention that
Stinger or Doobag are only two


160
0:6:51,12 --> 0:6:54,14
inches tall.


161
0:6:54,14 --> 0:6:57,63
Let's get out of the leathers.


162
0:6:57,63 --> 0:7:1,215
This board here was
a gift from Skip.


163
0:7:1,215 --> 0:7:3,2
This thing's 26 years old.


164
0:7:3,2 --> 0:7:4,508
Chris was [INAUDIBLE].


165
0:7:4,508 --> 0:7:11,46



166
0:7:11,46 --> 0:7:13,455
CHRIS CHRISTENSON: We brought
Harleys, then we got some Skip


167
0:7:13,455 --> 0:7:15,55
Fryes, and we got
an 11-footer.


168
0:7:15,55 --> 0:7:20,142
You know, it's just such a
different trip by bringing all


169
0:7:20,142 --> 0:7:21,85
the standard boards, you know.


170
0:7:21,85 --> 0:7:24,7
It's just fun to mix it up,
ride something that you


171
0:7:24,7 --> 0:7:26,49
normally wouldn't bring
on a surf trip.


172
0:7:26,49 --> 0:8:19,14
[MUSIC PLAYING]


173
0:8:19,14 --> 0:8:22,49
BRAD GERLACH: Of course we're
hoping to catch some surf.


174
0:8:22,49 --> 0:8:26,7
But yeah, we didn't get it.


175
0:8:26,7 --> 0:8:29,54
But we're kind of surfing on
those motorcycles anyway.


176
0:8:29,54 --> 0:8:43,26
[MUSIC PLAYING]


177
0:8:43,26 --> 0:8:45,406
CHRIS CHRISTENSON: And if the
waves were insane out here all


178
0:8:45,406 --> 0:8:47,62
the time, this would be
the best place in the


179
0:8:47,62 --> 0:8:48,604
world to live, huh?


180
0:8:48,604 --> 0:8:50,408
BRAD GERLACH: This would be a
great place to have a surf


181
0:8:50,408 --> 0:8:52,48
trip, when there's just waves.


182
0:8:52,48 --> 0:8:54,16
And just come out, go around.


183
0:8:54,16 --> 0:8:56,968
You come here in the
fall time, get all


184
0:8:56,968 --> 0:9:0,904
the colors, you know?


185
0:9:0,904 --> 0:9:4,375
It looks like Hansel and
Gretel live here.


186
0:9:4,375 --> 0:9:6,24
CHRIS CHRISTENSON: These bikes
are perfect for this type of


187
0:9:6,24 --> 0:9:6,92
riding, too.


188
0:9:6,92 --> 0:9:8,58
Riding through the coastal
towns, it's


189
0:9:8,58 --> 0:9:9,77
almost like an instinct.


190
0:9:9,77 --> 0:9:11,795
Like the other guy can just make
a facial expression, and


191
0:9:11,795 --> 0:9:14,245
you what he's going to do,
or you know which way


192
0:9:14,245 --> 0:9:14,98
he's going to turn.


193
0:9:14,98 --> 0:9:18,165
Instincts take over with
every [INAUDIBLE]


194
0:9:18,165 --> 0:9:19,946
and different communications.

196
0:9:29,31 --> 0:9:32,74
BRAD GERLACH: Going through the
beauty of New England with


197
0:9:32,74 --> 0:9:36,81
the lakes and the rivers and the
trees hanging over and the


198
0:9:36,81 --> 0:9:40,35
cherry blossoms and the
beautiful, perfect little


199
0:9:40,35 --> 0:9:43,72
gingerbread houses-- it's like,
is there a better place


200
0:9:43,72 --> 0:9:46,156
in the world to ride
a motorcycle?

BRAD GERLACH: That's it.


204
0:10:6,116 --> 0:10:8,995
I just wanted to pull over and
look down one of these streets


205
0:10:8,995 --> 0:10:9,781
just to check it out.


206
0:10:9,781 --> 0:10:12,43

had to make a phone call.

make it all by myself.

it with everyone else.

to the very next level.

I will ring your bell.
