###12 According to a report by the United Nations, since 1947 more than 150 million people have been witnesses to UFO sightings throughout the world. More than 20,000 of those have been documented landings.
###26 A Roper poll conducted in the United States reported that 70% of the U.S. population believe that the government is not telling the public everything it know about UFOs and extraterrestrials.
###39 We're dealing with the biggest story of the millennium.
###41 Visits to planet earth by alien spacecraft.
###43 Successful cover-up of the best data.
###45 Bodies and wreckage!
###47 For 58 years.
###48 The bottom line is I don't believe
###50 the claim of the Air force that...
###53 all sightings can be explained.
###54 This is the biggest secret
###56 in the history of the human race
###57 and particularly in the history
###58 of modern government.
###59 We are being engaged as a planet and
###62 as a species by other beings.
###64 The Canadian government is how I actually proved
###68 that the U.S. government was covering up their collection
###71 of UFO sightings and records.
###73 America and Britain had made it very clear,
###76 to allot of countries who have the same sort of sightings
###79 and the same resources, that this is something that
###81 they better not let out.
###83 Not until we say it's OK.
###85 If we would get off of this 'ego-trip',
###88 this western scientific 'ego-trip', we would not become the virus
###92 of the universe that we are.
###94 Nobody really wants us out there.
###96 The dependence on oil could be ended over night.
###99 We're being slowly conditioned to understand that there is life
###103 outside this planet and that we probably live in a
###106 universe and a galaxy, teeming with life.
###108 I had my own UFO sighting and said, well, case closed.
###111 There's nothing like seeing one for yourself
###113 to end the debate.
###115 Are we absolutely sure that we are not alone in this universe?
###119 We invite you now to come with us upon a great
###122 and wondrous journey.
###123 An adventure, perhaps, into your very own
###125 past
###126 present
###127 and future.
###129 See and hear the real stories
###130 and most importantly
###132 be introduced to the actual individuals
###134 who have volunteered to come forward to speak the truth.
###198 Do Flying saucers exist?
###201 Are extraterrestrials real?
###204 Is there a government cover-up?
###207 For nearly 60 years, denial has been the only
###210 official position of the governments of the world,
###213 relative to UFOs,
###214 alien abductions
###216 and extraterrestrial contactee reports.
###219 Endless debates have raged over the
###221 thousands of documented cases, that have been
###223 brought forward without official recognition.
###225 Some have been monumental incidents
###228 involving 100's or even 1000's of people.
###236 A flying disc crashed.
###238 The debris and alien bodies were flown to Wright Field Air force Base, in Dayton, Ohio.
###250 A triangular shaped object
###252 illuminated the entire forest with white light.
###254 The object had a pulsing red light on top
###256 and a bank of blue lights underneath.
###258 It left ground traces, and radioactive anomalies.
###261 This was a multiple witness sighting by military personnel.
###273 100's of reports of lighted objects
###275 frequently described as enormous and triangular in shape.
###278 Air force F16s chased many of these objects.
###282 The Belgian government cooperated with civilian UFO investigation.
###293 A huge V shaped object hovered over Phoenix
###295 for 10 to 15 minutes,
###297 observed by tens of thousands of people.
###304 Hundreds of objects appearing alone and in clusters
###307 appear throughout Mexico,
###309 observed by tens of thousands of people.
###323 Flying saucers are real.
###326 On the Blackvault you can download documents
###329 that prove that the United States Air Force bases
###332 have been breached by UFOs, (their restricted airspace.)
###335 That missile silos have mysteriously been shut down
###338 due to UFOs hovering over the base.
###342 I think you download that and you read it,
###344 err, you conclude, yeah, OK. UFOs pose
###346 a national security threat to the U.S. government.
###348 In 1952 I was an 8th grader
###350 and old enough to read for myself
###352 the big screen headlines that July about
###355 UFOs flying over the nation’s capitol,
###357 and the air force planes not being able to catch them.
###361 They're there, and they're paying attention.
###364 Incidents happened in the Soviet Union before it collapsed
###368 Incidents happened all over the northern U.S.
###371 at I.C.B.M. bases,
###373 where they came down
###375 hovered over the silos
###377 and played hell with the electronics.
###380 Pictures were taken.
###382 Hundreds of witnesses watched them.
###386 It's highly classified, you'll never hear about it.
###388 except from whistleblowers and bigmouths like me!
###392 While I was attending Northrop Aeronautical Institute
###395 and working for
###397 Douglas Aircraft in El Segundo, California.
###401 I had heard about George Adamski in one of the
###406 Sunday newspapers.
###407 He had his story and his pictures of contacts
###410 plus pictures of his ships.
###412 Well I had, by that time, seen so many
###414 during the day and the night
###415 that I felt
###417 I would like to go up and meet this gentleman.
###420 On the weekend he would entertain people
###422 who had come to see him.
###424 Military people, engineers, scientists.
###427 People from all walks of life.
###429 He had taken some beautiful pictures of the
###432 scout craft as well as the carrier ships.
###435 I went up to see him.
###436 He had a 6 inch telescope that he used
###438 to take the pictures of the flying saucers.
###441 And in using that scope,
###442 when I had finished
###444 I was just about to take my eye off the eyepiece
###447 when there was a blue/white streak
###450 that went by
###451 and I jerked my head up to see if I could see it and I didn't.
###456 I looked at his 15 inch telescope dome
###460 which was a couple of hundred yards from his house
###464 and there was a BIG flare of blue/white light
###468 and then it kind of closed back down, no noise.
###471 At first I thought it was an explosion, but it
###473 was a little slower than that.
###475 And there was an elliptical flying saucer
###479 Looked to me like it was hovering above the ground.
###482 So I heard it increase its frequency
###485 and it got brighter and brighter,
###486 and it was really pretty hard to look at.
###488 And it shot straight up,
###490 until it looked like one of the stars.
###493 If you've ever been to Mount Panama at night, on a dark night,
###496 boy they're big and bright!
###498 And it stopped for an instant, and then it shot over the horizon over San Diego.
###503 We have more than 1 witness who have been involved in the
###507 tracking of these objects on radar.
###508 and many people say,
###510 well look if this stuff is real,
###511 why are there no radar reports?
###513 I said, we have them!
###513 We actually have the radar tapes!
###515 From the F.A.A.!
###516 This is not just UFOs, and this is not just not
###520 being visited by guys from other planets.
###525 I was to learn later that
###528 our security,
###529 our intelligence people,
###530 our military people,
###531 concluded and learned,
###533 we're not merely dealing with inter-planetary visitation.
###537 We were being visited by guys from other star systems.
###541 Which, technologically we know what that means.
###543 They're not just from another like planet like Venus or Mars or somewhere!
###548 These guys are from other stars.
###550 I’m convinced after studies since 1958
###556 that the evidence is overwhelming
###557 and planet earth is being visited by
###559 intelligently controlled extraterrestrial spacecraft,
###562 in other words, some UFOs are alien spacecraft.
###565 Most are not, I don't care about those!
###567 Most isotopes aren't fissionable,
###569 I don't care about the ones that aren't,
###570 if I'm going to build a reactor!
###572 If somebody who had the clearance to carry nuclear weapons
###575 or launch nuclear weapons
###577 saw these objects over a nuclear facility
###580 and reported it, and have documents to prove it happened
###583 this is dispositive
###584 that's what someone who is wanting to look into this
###587 who says, well, could this really be true and I don't know about it?
###590 They need to look at that, and we've assembled it.
###592 We have a 600 page book of
###593 top secret documents and the transcripts of these witnesses.
###596 We have videotape.
###597 So I began watching the newspapers for any newspaper reports,
###601 I started buying magazines that had a UFO article in the magazine
###604 and collecting these and
###606 from those I would get names and addresses.
###609 And I often called the people that wrote the articles to get them.
###612 Then I would go interview those people myself,
###614 and if they took pictures,
###615 then I would try to get a copy of the pictures.
###617 and frequently did!
###619 And then I began,
###621 trading the pictures that I already had with other people that had pictures,
###624 to get more pictures, and
###625 eventually built a library of pictures, probably
###627 the largest in private hands in the world
###629 its over 4000, pictures of real UFOs.
###632 Now, if I can collect that many alone,
###634 as a single individual
###636 working by myself,
###638 how many pictures do you think the government has got,
###640 when every government employee is a potential investigator,
###644 and every agent is a trained investigator,
###647 all collecting and contributing to the government files
###651 they must have hangers full of pictures!
###653 What Air force manual 10-206 says is that
###656 a U.S. Air force pilot,
###658 who sees a UFO.
###660 Has to report it in a particular way and manner.
###663 They outline in this form, exactly how to report it.
###667 They say, list the size.
###669 The shape.
###670 Direction of travel.
###671 How big the object was.
###673 What were the wind conditions like?
###675 And you go through this big form,
###676 and say, you know,
###677 your UFO sighting.
###679 The manual then goes on to state
###681 that you have to forward this
###683 to the NORAD installation.
###685 This is that one Air force base that claims
###687 Oh no, we haven't collected these things since 1969.
###691 The problem is that this form
###692 was last updated in October of 2004.
###695 In 1977 I proposed and became a director of a
###701 proposed extraterrestrial communications study
###704 done in conjunction with the
###706 Jimmy Carter Whitehouse.
###708 Jimmy Carter, of course, had had a close encounter
###713 with a UFO, in the company of
###716 10 members of the Leary Georgia Lions Club in 1969
###721 while he was running for governor of Georgia.
###723 While he was governor of Georgia in 1973,
###726 he had filed an official UFO report, it's now
###731 on the internet, so everybody can see it.
###736 The 1976
###738 U.S. Presidential campaign was extraordinary,
###741 because it was waged between Jimmy Carter,
###745 on the one hand, he's had a close encounter.
###748 And the first campaign, waged on a platform,
###752 which included a disclosure plank, of sorts.
###756 Jimmy Carter was asked, on various occasions,
###759 and this is documented.
###761 Once elected, would he open up
###763 the extraterrestrial UFO files.
###766 And he said:
###767 YES
###767 HE WOULD.
###768 We have over 450 military and intelligence witnesses.
###773 Some are, they range from,
###775 Generals and Brigadier Generals.
###777 To Air Traffic Controllers and Strategic Air Command personnel,
###781 in the Air force.
###782 To civilian people in the F.A.A.
###785 The Federal Aviation Administration.
###788 To Astronauts and Cosmonauts.
###790 And it's an enormous database of,
###793 of people who have up close and personally seen
###796 UFOs or worked in those projects,
###800 in their capacity as a government or military person.
###804 Even with the massive amount of pressure
###806 governments can exert to maintain the ongoing cover-up,
###810 people continue to come forward and tell
###812 what they have personally experienced.
###815 Whoosh! - Like that!
###816 15 miles in a fraction of a second.
###819 I disengaged the autopilot
###821 to push the nose over because
###822 we were on a collision course.
###824 And when I did,
###826 I just saw it head-on. It was 300 feet in diameter.
###829 We knew that, but we had only known that
###830 because somebody was telling us, 300 feet in diameter!
###832 So at that time, I heard a hell of a noise!
###834 and I said to Fred,
###835 What the hell was that?
###837 He said:
###837 Well, the navigator and the radioman ducking,
###841 fell, hit their head, one hit, hurt their arm,
###843 they were scrambling on the deck, so a hell of a noise!
###845 I thought it had hit us underneath!
###847 So I said, well, where in the hell did it go?
###849 And Fred said, it's right over to the right.
###851 I couldn't see it, so it drifted far.
###854 About 5 miles away,
###856 It never got to the altitude
###857 that we were at.
###859 A few hundred feet below.
###860 I begin to watch it, well,
###862 we knew then it was a friendly encounter,
###864 it just wanted us to see it!
###866 So then I went to engage the autopilot again.
###869 The magnetic compass was going like this!
###873 and the Bird Dogs, which is a directional finder,
###876 Two of the Bird Dogs are pointing right at this thing,
###878 just vibrating like this!
###879 And it was allot of the electrical things in the airplane,
###881 that went haywire!
###883 So, I told Fred
###884 Did you see that coming?
###885 He said, as it was coming closer it was doing this!
###889 And so, I went back to the vacuum operated desk
###892 The whole airplane was vacuum operated and hydraulically operated controls,
###895 so I'd go back to that side.
###896 So then we'd sit there and watch it for a while,
###898 because it just paced us, stayed with us!
###900 And so the other crew
###901 knew how to land the large engines
###902 so I was sent back and they came forth.
###904 Al Jones,
###905 which was the Regional Plane Commander,
###907 took my seat.
###909 And was still there. He was watching it.
###911 And as I was walking back off,
###913 he decided he was going to chase it!
###916 And so he disengaged the autopilot!
###917 When I get back off,
###919 I wanted to see how the passengers were doing.
###920 They were all on the right hand side.
###922 they could see it underneath the wing!
###923 And then I thought, Oh hell!
###925 I recognized the doctor back there
###927 He was a psychiatrist
###929 out of the Thesdon Naval hospital.
###931 Plus a lot of other things.
###932 So I said, I had better talk to him first.
###935 Carnet would say:
###936 Did you see what we saw back there Doctor?
###938 And he grinned at me and looked at me straight in the eyes,
###940 and he says, yeah that was
###941 a flying saucer!
###942 I didn't look at it!
###943 I don't believe in such things!
###945 When I was 16 years old
###948 I was walking down the street in Arlington, Virginia
###950 and saw 7 red light type UFOs over Washington,
###955 that made headlines around the world,
###958 and, since then, I have seen
###961 8, alien vehicles on 8 occasions.
###964 The sightings I've had,
###965 are more,
###966 things flying right by,
###968 or blueish green orb things!
###970 I've had 5 sightings.
###972 I've never reported them.
###973 Because I don't need the grief.
###975 But the trick is, you know
###977 you can't mention the company name
###978 or be a company uniform.
###979 Two of my friends,
###981 excellent pilots, one of them was a famous pilot,
###984 and yet, they both got fired
###986 for doing interviews like this,
###987 but they were in uniform.
###988 Since I've been a child
###989 I'm looking up into the sky thinking,
###992 is there more than just us human beings,
###995 in this huge universe?
###997 Now I do believe there is more life forms.
###1000 Different life forms.
###1001 And more dimensions
###1003 than we can perceive.
###1005 I've had several sightings.
###1006 Probably, the closest sighting,
###1010 would have been,
###1011 back in 1974.
###1013 I was driving back,
###1015 between Ottawa and Montreal,
###1017 going towards Montreal.
###1020 I remember going on the highway,
###1022 and we came within, literally,
###1024 probably, several hundred feet
###1027 of a huge, huge ship!
###1029 And at first...
###1030 you know, we were driving away here,
###1032 and I'm thinking,
###1034 Am I really seeing this?!?!
###1036 And we slowed down.
###1038 And sort of peeked out.
###1039 and an enormous, enormous ship,
###1041 I would have to say,
###1042 that it was 2 or 3 times the size
###1045 of a 747!
###1047 And it completely, silently glided over, across the highway
###1051 and we saw it go off into the distance.
###1054 So there was no mistaking
###1055 that that was not anything at that time
###1058 that would have existed conventionally or militarily.
###1062 I was a Lieutenant from the Bulgarian Air force.
###1065 My plane was the MIG 21.
###1067 What I believe?
###1068 I believe there is much more going on
###1070 than we can see with our naked eye.
###1073 Being in the 3rd Battalion, 7th Marine regiment,
###1077 we were pretty active, we were on the East coast
###1079 in an area called, 'The Punchbowl'.
###1082 Which is just down the road from Heartbreak Ridge.
###1085 We had a lull in the fighting, so,
###1089 we just sat around and played poker.
###1092 And somebody looked up and said,
###1093 What the heck is that!?
###1095 and we all looked up.
###1096 and there was err, it look for all of the world,
###1099 like a chrome hubcap,
###1102 sitting up above us.
###1103 And if you looked at it
###1105 it kind of had a watery, shimmery look
###1108 and a little bit of a blueish white periphery.
###1113 And from time to time, it would appear to be
###1116 elliptical and sometimes circular.
###1120 So I imagine it was rocking a little bit.
###1125 There was just a hint of a dome
###1127 sometimes on it.
###1129 Well we watched it,
###1131 and our Colonel came out and took a look at it,
###1134 and he made a phone call.
###1137 Pretty soon, 4 F86 D model, saber jets came out,
###1144 and they tried to get to the object,
###1148 and it appeared that they hit some barrier,
###1152 which you couldn't see,
###1153 because they would stall out and do a
###1156 one and a half turn spin and then pull out at the bottom.
###1160 The flying saucer finally decided to leave,
###1165 and it got very, very bright.
###1167 And it was pretty difficult to look directly at it.
###1171 But it rose straight up and it went through the overcast.
###1176 Now, when it went through the overcast,
###1178 there were three black rings that radiated from the flange of the craft,
###1185 and went from the flange of the craft
###1187 all the way over the horizon, with no sound at all.
###1191 And what it looked like was,
###1192 somebody dropping a pebble into a glassy pool of water,
###1195 and the rings were spreading out.
###1197 In January of 2005.
###1200 5.24pm, I was driving south on Interstate 25, south of Denver.
###1206 and I see this black object,
###1209 coming up the road, above the road, in the sky.
###1213 and I thought, that's curious, what is that?
###1215 As I get closer, as we close,
###1216 I see that it is a,
###1219 solid
###1220 object.
###1221 I thought it might have been Canadian geese, for a start,
###1224 I thought it might have been a piece of plastic,
###1225 blown up in the breeze, like a kite.
###1228 But I could see it was a solid object
###1230 it was not affected by breeze in anyway.
###1232 It was flying on a straight course.
###1235 It looked black, it may have been some color
###1236 but because it was silhouetted against the sky,
###1238 it looked very dark.
###1240 It looked like a plank. It looked like a board.
###1242 An oblong shape.
###1243 It was bizarre!
###1244 It had a couple of little bumps on the leading edge, on one end,
###1248 and I thought, well if it's just junk,
###1250 that would be random, perhaps,
###1251 it certainly wouldn't be symmetrical,
###1253 and I looked at the other side, and sure enough
###1254 it had the identical bumps on the other side of the leading edge!
###1258 So it was an anomalous object,
###1262 Could I identify it?
###1263 Heck no! I couldn't relate to it!
###1265 It had no sweepback, no anhedral, no dihedral.
###1268 It didn’t have any external power plants,
###1271 no wings, no tail empennage.
###1274 flight control surfaces or
###1278 probes.
###1280 A search of the term 'Fastwalkers' on the internet,
###1283 immediately reveals references that 'Fastwalker' is a codename,
###1288 used by various government agencies to refer to UFOs or
###1292 as they are sometimes called,
###1294 Non Reference Targets.
###1298 Craft that I recorded that did the 180 degree turn
###1302 down on this portion of the screen.
###1305 They're called 'Fastwalkers', because of their speed.
###1309 The whole episode took about half a second to perform, or less!
###1315 And we're talking milliseconds!
###1317 And that kind of lets you know,
###1319 that it's not an earth satellite that we're looking at,
###1321 because it's moving so fast.
###1323 Plus the fact,
###1326 our satellites don't change direction,
###1329 180 degrees without changing speed, or 90 degrees.
###1333 And I have seen many of the shadows
###1336 go up and do a 90 degree, right across the screen.
###1340 Sometimes, you'll see 3 or 4 objects
###1343 in formation, looks like formation flying,
###1345 and one will branch off to the left and one will go to the right.
###1348 Somebody coined the phrase, 'Fastwalker'.
###1353 It's appropriate.
###1355 The Fastwalkers are these very rapid moving,
###1359 electrogravidic and anti-gravity discs and craft of various shapes.
###1364 The N.S.A. actually for a long time called these E.T.Vs,
###1368 Extra-Terrestrial Vehicles,
###1370 and from the military who have tracked these objects,
###1374 they've been called Fastwalkers because,
###1376 as apposed to 'Slowalkers', which are satellites.
###1379 Because they move at enormous speeds,
###1381 for example, they've been tracked at going 10's of
###1383 thousands of miles per hour in the atmosphere
###1385 and making a right hand turn without decelerating.
###1388 Well, you can't do that with a conventional system.
###1391 You have to correct the gravity and mass inertia.
###1393 and that's what these things are doing.
###1395 So these have been tracked on,
###1397 dedicated and classified radar systems.
###1399 Occasionally, people who are on an ordinary system,
###1402 will pick them up.
###1403 Today, the internet is literally alive with websites,
###1406 that are filled with detailed reports,
###1408 many of which, include convincing videos,
###1410 and pictures of unknown crafts and alien like creatures.
###1414 I live in Phoenix, Arizona.
###1416 I am a sky watcher, a UFO hunter.
###1419 I have a website called www.cnufos.com
###1422 I’ve had an interest in UFOs my whole life.
###1425 But officially that started on April 15th of 2004,
###1428 when I walked my dog in the middle of the night,
###1431 looked up in the sky and saw some strange lights.
###1433 I've got over 200 UFO video clips on my website.
###1437 I'm more interested in the day footage.
###1439 Now, the day footage is completely different
###1441 because that's harder to dismiss.
###1443 You know, so I would have to say every other month,
###1445  it seems like I'm catching something.
###1448 And I go out everyday.
###1450 Pretty much, 6 days a week, a couple of hours a day.
###1453 You know, you add all those hours up and that's allot of time.
###1456 Just to catch one thing for 20 seconds!
###1458 But that's more than most people see in a lifetime, so,
###1461 I think that's better than nothing.
###1463 Well I'm involved in the political resolution of the
###1468 I prefer to call it,
###1470 the Truth Embargo that the government have imposed,
###1473 on the facts regarding the extraterrestrial presence.
###1477 That presence has been established, I think,
###1481 many times over
###1482 by the citizen science research that has been going on since the 1940's.
###1486 The government did studies, but they were primarily for show.
###1490 and the issue from a government standpoint has been managed,
###1494 very intensely,
###1496 since 1947, at minimum!
###1499 Managed in a sense that,
###1501 the government was going to deal with it,
###1503 but deal with it within the national security structure,
###1506 and never acknowledge that there is anything to this.
###1509 But in fact there is!
###1510 We are being engaged as a planet and as a species
###1514 by other beings.
###1516 Possibly multiple species!
###1518 This has just been proven beyond any doubt at all,
###1521 by anyone who reads the research who isn't
###1524 compromised by being,
###1527 either an idiot or,
###1528 an employee of the government management of the issue,
###1531 can only arrive at one conclusion.
###1533 The evidence is overwhelming.
###1535 Videotape.
###1536 Daylight discs.
###1537 Night time discs.
###1539 Photographs.
###1540 Direct pilot sightings by the thousands!
###1543 Millions of sightings around the world.
###1545 There are testimonies from direct government involvement,
###1548 and of course, you've got an entire contactee
###1551 body of evidence that is now,
###1552 in the tens of thousands of reports.
###1555 Now, like never before,
###1556 astounding events are transcending national and geographical boundaries,
###1560 currently happening in Brazil and Mexico.
###1564 Unprecedented UFO sightings,
###1566 are sweeping the entire area of south and central America.
###1570 Does the key to understanding,
###1571 UFOs and aliens,
###1572 and their relationship with each of us,
###1574 laying being able to simply perceive
###1576 what is in a higher spectrum?
###1578 Like seeing the infrared range,
###1580 or other dimensional frequencies?
###1582 Images gathered from infrared cameras in Mexico
###1585 and special cameras used in Brazil
###1588 seem to indicate that the aliens and their crafts
###1590 may in fact be all around us.
###1594 Jaime Maussan is one of Mexico’s foremost journalists.
###1597 Internationally known and respected,
###1599 for more than three decades of journalistic work,
###1602 his investigations and reporting in the UFO field
###1604 have made him an icon to UFO researchers, worldwide.
###1608 Jaime's weekly network television show,
###1610 60 Minutes,
###1611 in Mexico, reaches millions of people each week,
###1614 and regularly carries segments on the subject of UFOs.
###1618 This flap has been recorded on video.
###1623 It means that we have evidence to prove
###1626 that something is really happening,
###1629 in the Mexican Republic.
###1631 The video camera has become,
###1633 the most important instrument,
###1636 to really capture this new reality.
###1641 Even the Mexican Army,
###1643 the Air force in Mexico,
###1646 recorded UFOs.
###1648 The video was given to me,
###1650 and I released that to the world!
###1652 In that case, that happened,
###1654 on March the 5th, 2004.
###1659 The soldiers were able to record something that
###1661 they couldn't see with their own eyes!
###1664 and that's amazing!
###1665 That was the first time,
###1667 someone recorded something, that
###1672 they were not able to see!
###1678 With Jaime Maussan, aboard a plane
###1681 coming from San Antonio to Mexico City, flying,
###1684 over a place called,
###1686 San Luis Potosi'
###1688 to film a UFO, following the plane!
###1690 It was the detected by the radars
###1692 and they have everything on film.
###1694 So, for us it is normal.
###1695 Maybe because we are searching for it.
###1697 Maybe because we are trying to look for this reality.
###1701 Maybe they are following us!
###1702 I don't know, but it happened to me,
###1704 that at least 50 times! Maybe more!
###1707 There are objects that we cannot see with our own eyes,
###1711 but
###1712 THEY
###1712 ARE
###1712 THERE
###1713 They are watching us.
###1715 In the last months, in Mexico,
###1717 after thousands of videos,
###1720 we have been registering some of the most spectacular videos.
###1724 You can see hundreds and hundreds of objects
###1728 making formations, and flying together
###1731 exactly, the same thing that you can see,
###1736 in the military video.
###1738 These formations moving at the same speeds,
###1741 in the same direction,
###1745 at the same altitude.
###1753 As the more one researches, the more one discovers,
###1756 that literally 10's of thousands of very credible people of every age,
###1761 occupation,
###1762 and nationality are claiming,
###1763 that they have had personal contact
###1766 with either aliens, or interdimensional beings.
###1768 Credible researchers now say that as many as 60 different species
###1772 of intelligent, super conscious beings,
###1774 have been interacting with humanity for millions of years.
###1778 Physically, they look, they're humanoid.
###1781 Their skin is as white as a piece of paper.
###1785 Throughout much of their adult life
###1787 they are the same height that I am.
###1789 5'11, 6 feet tall.
###1791 Their eyes are perhaps twice as large as ours.
###1795 They're typically blue eyes with white pupils.
###1797 Although, when they get older, especially the men,
###1801 their eyes take on a pink shade.
###1804 Their eyes stretch further around the sides of their head than human eyes do.
###1809 And their ears and their nose,
###1812 are only about half the size of human ears and noses,
###1816 and their ears lay back along the side of their head more than a human does.
###1821 Their lips are not as prominent as humans,
###1824 and they don't have teeth, they just have ridges,
###1828 because they are plant eaters, they don't eat meat.
###1831 How can we know for sure,
###1833 exactly how many extraterrestrial races
###1835 are visiting us or interacting with humanity?
###1838 There are different sources,
###1841 disclosing some of that information.
###1843 I find one of the most credible to be whistleblowers.
###1845 People who have worked in these various secret projects,
###1850 who in some way have kind of,
###1852 been given information that gives them an idea,
###1854 of exactly how many races are here.
###1857 One of those sources is a,
###1860 Sergeant who worked in the, for 22 years in the Air force,
###1864 Clifford Stone.
###1866 And he was involved in these top secret projects,
###1870 that involve the retrieval of crashed discs.
###1873 And in that process he was able to get quite a bit of information on
###1878 how many extraterrestrial races are visiting us.
###1880 And he came up with the figure of 57!
###1884 Others have come up with slightly more.
###1887 Another prominent whistleblower,
###1891 a former employee of the C.I.A.
###1893 is John Lear.
###1894 And he talks about, over 60 races,
###1897 that are visiting the Earth.
###1898 On one night I saw between 200 and 300,
###1903 different tall, white individuals,
###1906 there were so many, I couldn't count them!
###1908 Lined up along the mountains to the east of the lawn,
###1911 where the ammunition bunker was.
###1914 On the night that the tall white lady known as Pamela
###1918 was supposed to finish her final exam,
###1921 to be head of the technology transfer team,
###1925 to go into Livermore.
###1927 In amongst those two or three hundred tall whites,
###1930 That's just an estimate, because I,
###1932 I couldn't, there was a crowd of people and I couldn't count them all.
###1936 There were also American Air force personnel,
###1941 nobody below the rank of Colonel.
###1943 There were others like a four star General.
###1946 A three star General,
###1947 There were several of them.
###1949 There were also several American government people,
###1952 in civilian clothing over there.
###1954 Could it be possible that our universe is not only immense,
###1958 but that it is full of life,
###1959 and that there is a great diversity of this life,
###1962 spread throughout own own local galaxy,
###1964 and even our solar system.
###1966 Equally outstanding is the recent revelation by the government of Brazil,
###1970 of their intent to turn over the official UFO files,
###1973 dating back to as early as 1954, to the people of Brazil.
###1977 Well, the Varginha case is probably the
###1980 best well documented case that we have in Brazil,
###1983 and probably in the world.
###1985 You know that over 80 witnesses came forward,
###1990 first hand witnesses came forward,
###1992 during the first weeks, and they are still coming after it happened
###1997 during all of these years we still
###1999 keep getting witnesses that come forward and tell us
###2002 pieces of the big story, that we know already, in comprises,
###2008 the capture of at least,
###2011 two alien creatures
###2012 in Aselo, Varginha.
###2014 We know for a fact, because we have it all documented,
###2017 plus the witnesses have confirmed and cross confirmed
###2022 that one alien was captured in the morning of that day
###2027 which was a Saturday.
###2028 About 10.30
###2029 by a Fire Department and some personnel from the Army.
###2034 Another creature was seen, on the same day
###2037 by middle-afternoon, by three girls.
###2040 It was them who called attention of all the city
###2044 to the fact that, strange creatures had been seen.
###2048 Because when the first one was seen and captured in the morning,
###2051 it didn't draw too much attention.
###2053 but in the afternoon when the girls saw another creature,
###2058 and then, spread the word to everybody,
###2061 We saw the devil!
###2062 That's what they thought they saw.
###2063 That night of the Saturday, January 20th 1996
###2067 that second creature, probably the same one saw by the girls,
###2071 was also captured. By a police car, actually a military police car.
###2078 with two policeman inside.
###2081 The one who was sitting in the passenger seat was Marco Eli Chereze,
###2085 and he was lucky enough to be the one, who spotted the creature
###2090 and grabbed it with his bear hands,
###2094 got back to the car,
###2095 put the creature in his lap,
###2096 and took it to hospital.
###2098 25 days after that, he died, on February 15th,
###2102 of some bacteria attacks,
###2107 proving that his immune system,
###2112 was absolutely destroyed.
###2116 Army personnel and authorities kept it all secret for lots of time,
###2121 until the UFO researchers started protesting,
###2124 along with the press,
###2126 and we gave so much pressure, that eventually,
###2128 information was released about it.
###2129 The exobiological aspect that the probability of life out there
###2133 has actually increased over what it was in 1950.
###2136 and the err, indication that there may be ways
###2140 of traveling faster than the speed of light.
###2141 So hey, they can get here from there!
###2144 It doesn't mean that they are coming in 5 minutes,
###2146 or they're coming every hour of everyday, but you know,
###2149 they might be able to traverse just huge distances,
###2151 in a period of weeks or months or something,
###2153 instead of spending hundreds or thousands of years.
###2155 Well, look at the UFO sightings.
###2157 Maybe they provide the answer that they are here!
###2160 There was talk in the War Room, about a study that was underway.
###2165 And this study became  initiated in 1961,
###2169 as the result of an event that occurred,
###2172 early February, in 1961.
###2175 Where a flight of UFOs were flying from the Soviet sector to the east,
###2181 over the Warsaw pact, towards the west, over the NATO lines.
###2186 These, objects were very high and were very fast.
###2192 They were in formation.
###2194 They appeared to be circular in shape.
###2197 And they were obviously under intelligent control.
###2201 They came in a formation of what appeared to be,
###2205 almost 100 of them.
###2208 And they flew  in formation,
###2210 at a high rate of speed from the east, over NATO
###2214 over the channel, southern coast of England, where they turned,
###2220 flew north and disappeared from NATO radar over the Norwegian sea.
###2225 We found out that the Soviets had gone on alert.
###2228 The Warsaw pact had gone on alert because they had picked them up.
###2232 All of our Air force and radar sensory devices picked them up.
###2241 NATO thought those objects belonged to the Russians.
###2244 We found later that the Russians thought they belonged to us.
###2249 Both forces, were to find out later,
###2254 that they didn't belong to any of us.
###2257 That they belonged to somebody else!
###2260 And of course, the BIG question is:
###2262 Who the hell do they belong to?
###2263 Who are they? What are they?
###2265 Where are they from?
###2267 They demonstrated incredibly high technology.
###2272 They were not jets.
###2273 There were no contrails.
###2276 They were circular, they were metallic.
###2279 They were in formation.
###2281 They moved, obviously, under intelligent control.
###2285 NATO - SHAPE.
###2287 Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers,
###2289 initiated a study in 1961,
###2293 which was underway when I arrived in 1963.
###2297 To determine what the hell these things were!
###2299 Some experts now claim, that societies exist
###2302 in our universe, at every conceivable level of social and spiritual development.
###2307 Societies and civilizations that express themselves
###2310 in countless manners of physical forms and spiritual ways.
###2315 Have great wars and conflicts occurred within our own Solar System?
###2320 Does our true planetary past include rebellions
###2323 and disputes that have raged throughout our heavens?
###2326 In our distant past,
###2328 have massive spacecrafts rained destruction down from the heavens?
###2332 Ravishing continents and destroying advanced civilizations?
###2336 GENESIS 6:1
###2339 When men began to increase in number on the Earth,
###2342 and daughters were born to them,
###2343 the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful,
###2346 and they married any of them they chose.
###2349 The historical record is plain!
###2351 This has been a phenomenon that has been around since our recorded history.
###2356 The Vedas, the Hindu Vedas, which are among the oldest writings in the world,
###2360 talk about the flying Vimana's,
###2362 and how that they were used to launch weapons, and blow up cities and
###2367 all this stuff, you know,
###2369 Again, we've got Ezekiel, and it just goes all the way back.
###2374 So they've been here all along.
###2376 If their game plan was like an Independence Day type invasion,
###2380 where they were going to blow up everything and eat everybody or whatever,
###2384 It would have happened, long before now!
###2386 My main question was: Is God out there too?
###2389 If God is on this planet, is he out there too?
###2392 and those questions were answered by reading the bible.
###2394 And that really set me on this journey,
###2396 to understanding the abduction phenomenon.
###2398 What is the reasoning for this?
###2402 Who is doing this?
###2403 And all those questions that we all ask.
###2405 We think of aliens and we think of angels as,
###2408 you know, divine beings, that we have no idea of,
###2411 and we don't see and we don't communicate with on a daily basis.
###2415 But it is not only the bible and other holy works
###2418 that are filled with references to UFOs and extraterrestrials.
###2422 Drawings, paintings, stone carvings and even coins,
###2426 reflect strange humanoid like creatures and their flying crafts.
###2430 Serious researchers now say that the real question
###2433 is not whether there are abductions occurring,
###2436 but are the abductions to help, or to harm us?
###2439 And they Greys were authorized to, sort of like a Noah's Ark,
###2444 to develop a full genetic and DNA bank
###2449 of all flora and fauna on this planet, so as to
###2452 replant it, centuries down the road, after the catastrophe.
###2457 Can you imagine, any President,
###2461 whether it be Bush or Clinton or whatever, standing before the public, and saying, yes,
###2467 I am aware that we have this joint program with some aliens,
###2472 to upgrade our biological computers.
###2474 To build better bodies to house our souls in future incarnations.
###2480 You can't talk about things like that!
###2482 He wouldn't be able to do the job that we hired him to do.
###2485 What we know of the reptilians by a number of
###2489 abductees, contactees and also whistleblowers is that
###2493 there seems to be
###2495 allot of evidence supporting the existence of this race of beings,
###2499 on the planet for thousands of years.
###2501 In other words that we might consider them to be an indigenous Earth species
###2506 an advanced, non-human species, that has lived on the Earth for thousands of years,
###2511 and actually may have played quite an important role,
###2514 in the genetic manipulation or engineering,
###2518 which supposedly has happened when it comes to humanity.
###2522 There are various groups, individuals, species,
###2526 who from time to time, come and visit this planet, and ZOOP around,
###2530 and I think that to try to ascribe any one particular motive to them is err,
###2537 tantamount to us looking up at the air at a Boeing 767 aircraft and saying:
###2544 Are those people good or bad?
###2546 You know, you just can't ask that.
###2548 It's just, it's a group of people, a group of intelligent beings
###2552 some of them are good, some of them are not so good.
###2555 But I will say this, I don't think there is any reason for great fear and anxiety.
###2560 Most recently, two new terms have emerged that also describe human/alien interaction.
###2566 The most widely used is the word Experiencer,
###2569 for those who have had some sort of experience, good or bad.
###2574 and Participator, which has been coined to explain the cases where the individual may have been
###2580 an abductee originally but has transcended the situation by now,
###2584 volunteering to participate with his abductors.
###2588 My contact with extraterrestrial intelligence occurred,
###2592 when I was aboard my sailing boat in Hawaii, in the Honolulu harbor.
###2596 and it was early one morning, it was about 5am and I had gotten up early,
###2601 and I had gotten a cup of coffee and I had gone back to my bunk
###2604 and I was just laying there completely dressed,
###2606 trying to err, just look at the beautiful sunrise that was occurring through the
###2612 large skylight above my bed,
###2614 and then suddenly, the most incredible energy enveloped me,
###2618 and the whole room began to, like glow and glisten and a beautiful woman
###2623 materialized right next to my bed!
###2626 And at first I thought I was dreaming or hallucinating,
###2630 and I said, you can't be real! And she said, well I am!
###2633 and I said, well why are you here? And she said,
###2637 I'm here as a representative of a group of friends that want you to come to a briefing.
###2644 The room was lit up completely, but my eyes were closed.
###2648 I knew somehow, not to open my eyes!
###2652 There was something telling me:
###2653 Don't open your eyes because you won't like what you're going to see!
###2658 Eventually, I did open my eyes, because I could hear noise in the room,
###2662 there was like a scuffling on, the floor, I opened my eyes,
###2666 there were three, small, grey beings with big black eyes
###2672 and big heads, and very skinny, spindly limbs,
###2677 They pulled me up out of the bed,
###2681 and then with one behind me and one each side of me holding my elbows,
###2687 walked me towards the window.
###2689 And I'm thinking, well the windows are closed guys,
###2692 so you had better open them before we go any further!
###2694 So there was this rationality and irrationality going on at the same time.
###2699 I boarded what could be called a saucer.
###2703 It was some type of an interdimensional vehicle,
###2706 that took me to the briefing that was occurring
###2709 on a planet, a local planet here in our system,
###2712 it was Jupiter.
###2714 And the whole planet just radiated with the energy.
###2717 And I spent time there with these incredible people, or beings,
###2723 and I got a glimpse of mankind’s destiny or future, as it was possible.
###2729 And as we approached the window, I closed my eyes.
###2733 And as I did, I felt this stickiness.
###2737 It was like, it was a stickiness and a feeling
###2741 of something being pulled very slowly across my face.
###2744 It wasn't painful, it was just very, very weird!
###2747 The next, I opened my eyes, because I felt cold, I felt wind on my face,
###2753 and I was aware that I was now floating, outside of the window, 3 stories up
###2759 looking down at the car park, with a very bright light above my head.
###2764 I couldn't really see what was above my head,
###2766 I was just aware of this very bright light.
###2768 One little grey on each elbow, I was aware of them,
###2772 and we floated up into the craft!
###2775 And people have said: Well, then you were abducted!
###2778 And I said, no, I went very willingly.
###2781 And they've also asked,
###2782 how can you tell if you were to meet an extraterrestrial?
###2786 And I would have to say, the energy field.
###2788 Because, when they're in your presence,
###2791 they absolutely resonate at a frequency that is so much higher.
###2796 It can only be described as dealing with them could be described as ecstasy!
###2801 I had been taken in the middle of the night, while I was asleep,
###2807 I was asleep through the whole thing until all of a sudden,
###2811 I felt some pressure going up my nose,
###2815 and it startled me so much, that I opened my eyes.
###2820 And when I opened my eyes, I saw this large headed being,
###2824 with grey skin, large black eyes, and small other features,
###2832 that was looking down at me.
###2835 He had long fingers that he was using to hold this instrument,
###2840 that he was using to shove up my nose!
###2844 I feel knowledge is power.
###2847 And some day,
###2849 maybe next week,
###2851 maybe tomorrow,
###2852 maybe in 5 years from now,
###2854 we're going to get all of the proof we need that somebody exists.
###2859 Hey an E.T. might show up and I might actually get an interview!
###2862 The point is, that the more that we know about this subject,
###2866 then the less legend can take over.
###2869 If you see a craft hanging near you,
###2873 don't get out of the car, don't stop the car.
###2876 Don't see what's happening.
###2878 If you see one coming towards you,
###2881 you don't have to be an abductee, if you don't want to be!
###2884 They go away, evidently.
###2886 We have 10's and 10's of people telling us:
###2889 Listen, I don't want to do that anymore, and they let them go.
###2893 What we call abductions, or certain categories of abductions,
###2898 took place as a result of an authorized genetic upgrade of the human race.
###2905 trying to get us out of our war-like ways,
###2907 and act-illogically ecocidal ways.
###2911 The indigenous reptilians seem to
###2914 have a very strong interest in the biosphere of Earth being
###2918 stable, that it's not jeopardized unduly,
###2922 and some who have kind of,
###2925 analyzed what the reptilians have been doing, or had some kind of interaction,
###2928 believe that this is because, the reptilians view humanity as a resource,
###2933 and they don't want that resource to damage itself, or damage the biosphere.
###2937 They had about 18 scientists and all had been
###2939 working on various stages of the project,
###2942 gathered around a big oval table in Los Alamos Headquarters,
###2946 with Edward Teller, the head of the Atomic Energy Commission,
###2950 sitting at the head of the table,
###2952 One of the aliens, on the opposite side of the table from my engineering friend,
###2957 put in a white shirt and slacks so he would look less alien,
###2960 but he still had his alien, bigger head and bigger eyes, black eyes,
###2965 and he was sitting in the conference,
###2968 he could understand everybody else because he was telepathic,
###2971 and the only way he could communicate though,
###2973 was with the signs that he had developed with my engineer friend,
###2976 to answer the question.
###2977 But here was a man, an alien from another planet,
###2980 sitting in a conference, in 1968
###2983 in Los Alamos Headquarters,
###2985 on the progress of learning how to bridge the gap,
###2987 between the alien technology and ours.
###2989 They were going to suggest to the American generals,
###2992 additional technology exchange projects,
###2995 and I think they were using me as the test guinea-pig,
###2998 to take me onboard the scout craft,
###3001 and then they could test my reaction,
###3003 to what I was impressed with and what I wasn't with.
###3005 My life changed and I was never, ever quite the same.
###3009 So, the study itself, was not as complete as it could have been.
###3014 They concluded what they wanted to conclude.
###3015 1: There was not a threat involved.
###3018 2: They weren’t the Soviets.
###3021 3: The evidence was overwhelming, they were extraterrestrial.
###3025 4: There were four groups involved.
###3030 Four different groups.
###3032 And they were all humanoid.
###3035 But they were not human.
###3037 Only one of the four was what we consider to be human.
###3042 One group out of the four looked so much like us,
###3046 I mean, almost identical to us,
###3049 these guys could have put on a suit and a tie!
###3053 The females,
###3054 because we encountered some of them as well.
###3058 They could have put on a dress, suit and tie, coat or jacket,
###3062 sit down with you, next to you in a restaurant,
###3065 sit next to you in a theatre,
###3067 and you'd never know!
###3069 These extraterrestrials, they have a body like ours.
###3079 and these extraterrestrial vehicles,
###3090 I’m using this in a large sense, or the people inside the craft -
###3112 It's very difficult,
###3113 because they make themselves seen and known to people on Earth,
###3120 so it's probably logical that they are inside a craft,
###3124 instead of coming from somewhere else without a craft.
###3143 They will have to have a soul like we do.
###3149 They'd have to have some kind of body,
###3152 otherwise they would be angels.
###3162 How can countries, one of which actually borders with the United States,
###3166 be having UFO visitations by the hundreds,
###3169 when other major nations of our world insist, that they are not?
###3174 And even more importantly,
###3176 how can these countries' governmental policy,
###3178 both official and otherwise be,
###3181 that they never have had UFO or alien contact?
###3185 The only logical explanation,
###3187 is in fact that governments are willing to lie.
###3190 For the past 9 years I have been researching into the,
###3193 United States government files,
###3195 on what they have on the UFO phenomenon,
###3196 and all sorts of different conspiracies.
###3199 And I've reached 183'000 pages,
###3202 of government documents on the internet!
###3204 There is a political block,
###3205 what I call a 'Truth Embargo',
###3207 instituted by the government,
###3208 that they are not ready to formally acknowledge,
###3212 this "presence".
###3213 Anything that involved absolute proof,
###3215 like hardware and bodies,
###3216 were siphoned off completely into another track.
###3219 They just can't allow information to come out overnight,
###3221 so people would be perturbed
###3223 and actually demand that something be done about it.
###3226 They stonewall it, deny it, lie about it, for, you know,
###3231 30 or 40 years,
###3232 and then finally just announce it as if it's fact and everybody goes,
###3235 yeah, OK!
###3236 It's clear we're dealing with a cosmic 'Watergate'.
###3239 Meaning, some few people within major governments,
###3241 have known since at least July 1947,
###3244 when two crashed flying saucers and several alien bodies were recovered in New Mexico,
###3248 that indeed, some UFOs are alien spacecraft.
###3251 The government setup Project Bluebook, the Air force did,
###3256 in order to investigate this subject on a,
###3260 let me say, a low level.
###3261 Researchers,
###3263 mostly, regular citizens,
###3266 have proven without a doubt there's an extraterrestrial presence
###3268 and we're being engaged, the evidence is overwhelming.
###3271 In some cases, you can actually point to where the Air force explanation
###3274 completely contradicts,
###3276 what’s inside the sighting report itself.
###3279 The word UFO is actually a disinformation term,
###3282 that was invented after they knew that they weren’t unidentified,
###3285 and they knew they didn't fly!
###3287 So it's sort of a, mind play.
###3290 When we had first evidence of E.T. visitation,
###3295 and hardware and so on, and so on came along,
###3300 the U.S. government took the attitude,
###3301 that they couldn't release this
###3303 to the general public, because it had extreme implications for defense.
###3308 We don't want our enemies to know that we've got one,
###3311 because then they might try to get one.
###3312 To the extent that we might be able to back-engineer the technology,
###3315 we don't want to err,
###3317 tell somebody else that we're trying to do such a thing.
###3320 Gus Grissom, who was probably the person that I was closest to,
###3324 felt that they were Spam in a can,
###3326 and that the Astronauts were just a public relations campaign,
###3329 for a secret military program that was spending much more.
###3333 The military space program was getting,
###3335 you know, was a gleaming jewel,
###3337 compared to the junk that N.A.S.A. was getting at the time.
###3339 You can get a certain amount of information out through the large media,
###3342 but it's very superficial and very brief,
###3344 that's what we've found.
###3345 The in-depth sort of, disclosure of what's really going on,
###3349 who's behind it, what the agenda is,
###3352 that is almost always stopped,
###3353 or if they try to do it,
###3355 it gets turned into something ridiculous.
###3357 I almost hate the term UFOs because,
###3359 they really aren't unidentified to
###3362 the people that know what's going on, or the researchers too.
###3368 allot of people that have the answers,
###3371 felt it was safe to come out of the water,
###3372 so they're putting out their information on the internet,
###3376 and, you know, disguised or whatever,
###3378 but, so these other agents who say they're
###3382 scanning all the time to counteract what's
###3384 being said by other people from Intel to think it was safe to OK,
###3388 they can put this out, or they feel like it's the right thing to do now.
###3392 You know, enough is enough.
###3393 Mankind has a right to know type of thing.
###3395 When I worked for Douglas, I was assigned to the Douglas Skyrocket.
###3399 They wanted me to wire up a camera out on the wing tip
###3403 to look through a course window, back at the canopy.
###3407 So that they could monitor the pilot, to see what he was doing.
###3412 While I went through the hanger, which was secured.
###3417 Well, there were two gentlemen in there, and they introduced themselves.
###3420 One was Naval Intelligence, and the other one was C.I.A.
###3424 And I started working, doing my job, wiring up the camera.
###3430 Well they sat around and talked and it became very apparent to me,
###3433 that they were there for that purpose, to talk!
###3436 They knew about all my flying saucer experiences,
###3440 all the way from Korea!
###3441 They told me, Intelligence, the C.I.A. Intelligence group,
###3445 had three intelligence digests.
###3449 Flying saucer photographs,
###3451 and witness documentation,
###3452 from all over the world!
###3454 And they said that I should probably try to get those three copies,
###3459 and that's when I wrote to Admiral Freeman,
###3463 and wasn't able to get the documents, incidentally.
###3469 In addition to that,
###3471 they told me that I should,
###3474 tell people about what my experiences have been.
###3480 They said tell everybody you can!
###3484 Because they can't!
###3486 They were not aloud to talk about it.
###3488 There is this curtain of ridicule that's been drawn up around the,
###3491 UFO phenomenon,
###3493 and as long as that curtain of ridicule holds solid,
###3497 the scientists will be afraid to
###3500 contribute to anything, to looking into UFOs.
###3506 And part of that curtain of ridicule involves the fact that,
###3509 hardly any decent papers have gotten into the refereed, scientific literature.
###3515 So that curtain of ridicule may be slightly opened up now that they have a
###3520 paper that they can refer to if they feel like writing their own papers on UFOs.
###3526 The secrecy has invaded, like a cancer, many institutions,
###3531 including the media, the government and corporations.
###3533 I got into more and more controversial and exotic subjects,
###3538 and I found myself a journalist without a journal!
###3541 There is definitely very tight control,
###3543 over the flow of information of certain topics,
###3545 through our corporate controlled mass media.
###3548 They seem to take it upon themselves to be the gatekeepers of information.
###3554 Part of this information that they are keeping from us,
###3557 is the just absolutely immense wealth of
###3560 information, concerning the UFO phenomenon,
###3564 and the fact that it can be tracked and documented,
###3566 all the way back through history.
###3569 The only institution that is more corrupt,
###3572 than what I'm describing as this rogue,
###3574 transnational, cleptocracy,
###3576 is the major media.
###3579 More worse than the congress, worse than the Whitehouse,
###3582 worse than anything at the normal level of clearances at the Pentagon,
###3585 is big media.
###3587 Big media does not report the truth about these things,
###3590 because they are not free to.
###3591 And we think in the United States and in the western world,
###3594 we really have a free press,
###3595 we have a free press on everything that's non-important,
###3598 on the really important issues, it's very controlled,
###3601 and this is the most important issue.
###3602 This is the biggest secret in the history of the human race.
###3605 The known modern history of government.
###3608 And they have co-operated with keeping the secret.
###3611 How is this cover-up contained,
###3615 and maintained through international borders,
###3619 and if it is, are their motivations the same?
###3622 The best guess is that,
###3625 since America has such overwhelming economic power,
###3631 the only worse thing than America being mad at you,
###3635 is for America to ignore you.
###3637 So many countries economies depend on America, that I think
###3643 that they take their orders from America in some ways.
###3646 When it comes to the cover-up,
###3648 I think that's one of them.
###3649 The U.S. government is not only pressuring the Brazilian government,
###3654 but it's making pressure
###3656 over almost all countries
###3658 that are some how aligned politically, aligned to the United States.
###3662 Now, all south America, except maybe for Chile and Venezuela,
###3668 who has Chavez, who is a rebel!
###3670 All the rest of Latin America, is very aligned to U.S. politics.
###3677 So, all these countries, will do just exactly,
###3680 what the U.S. President tells them,
###3683 it is, keep this under wraps!
###3686 Recent media polls show that over 100 million people in the United States alone,
###3691 believe that there is some form of extraterrestrial life.
###3694 45% believe that the Earth has been visited by extraterrestrial beings.
###3699 Nationally known journalists continue to turn a deaf ear to the public’s demands
###3703 for true investigative reporting on a daily basis.
###3708 Accepting instead, the dribble of denial from numerous government agencies as fact,
###3713 while refusing to interview the legions of researchers,
###3716 who have made serious scientific investigation,
###3718 of UFOs and alien contact, their life's work.
###3723 What else are the governments of the world, not saying?
###3728 What if there is positive proof that UFOs do in fact exist?
###3733 What if that proof has existed for years, but
###3736 has been hidden neatly within the fabric of a system of lies and grand deception?
###3741 We need to be very concerned about the way in which this whole
###3744 area has been managed by the national security agencies responsible.
###3748 By maintaining secrecy, keeping people in the dark, it means that
###3752 we really don't know whether this secrecy, and
###3757 withholding the information,
###3758 withholding the technologies,
###3760 from the general public arena,
###3761 is really for the best interest of all of us.
###3764 The problem has been since the early 1950's,
###3767 and err, I have the government documents!
###3771 The United States government has instituted a policy
###3774 of denial and control over the information.
###3778 Nothing happening there folks!
###3780 Nothing happening there folks!
###3782 And if somebody persists in saying, but I saw it!
###3785 Then they are ridiculed.
###3786 You got a screw loose, something’s not right with him!
###3789 This is absolutely just unconscionable,
###3792 in a country that pays lip service to freedom and individual liberty.
###3798 Because there have been so many people,
###3800 whose lives have been wrecked,
###3802 whose families have been wrecked,
###3804 because of this policy of denial and ridicule,
###3807 over a phenomenon that has happened worldwide for centuries!
###3811 Disclosure has a very defined definition. It means,
###3815 the formal acknowledgement by the governments of the world,
###3818 of the extraterrestrial presence.
###3819 As fellow inhabitants of planet Earth, we live in a rapidly changing world.
###3824 The advent of modern communication networks and the internet,
###3827 has made maintaining the UFO cover-up,
###3829 a difficult and demanding undertaking.
###3833 Brian Vike of HBCC UFO, has the number 1 UFO website to send information to.
###3840 Him and Rense and UFOCasebook,
###3844 are the three places that I always send my footage to because,
###3847 they will only put verified sightings on their site,
###3850 they just won't put junk up there.
###3852 And I know they get over 3 or 4, up to 10 million hits a month!
###3856 For over half a century, the United States,
###3859 Great Britain and a host of aligned countries,
###3862 have been able to maintain a vast web of secrecy
###3865 over what is actually happening worldwide,
###3867 relative to aliens, or what are generally known as E.B.Es.
###3870 Extraterrestrial Biological Entities.
###3873 But that is rapidly changing,
###3875 and disclosure,
###3876 the lifting of the truth embargo,
###3878 is now taking place.
###3880 I'll be getting over 500'000 hits this month.
###3883 But the interesting thing about that is,
###3886 that a couple of thousand of those hits each month, are from the military.
###3889 As far as sharing information on the internet, that is the best way to do it,
###3893 and probably the safest way.
###3895 Only because, I know I've sent DVDs to people and they haven't received them.
###3899 And I would email them and say, look, I'm going to send you a DVD,
###3903 can you analyze it for me, and let me know what you think this is?
###3906 2 weeks later, they'll email me and say, well I never got it!
###3909 I'm just waiting for that day, when they come knocking on my door
###3912 and want to talk to me about it, but uh, until that day, I think,
###3916 I think they know who I am, I think they know we're here. I think,
###3919 this is the way it's going to be done from here on out.
###3922 Because the military definitely doesn't want
###3924 to talk about it anymore!
###3926 Everything at night to them is a flare or an airplane.
###3928 On the contrary, we have all this evidence that shows otherwise.
###3932 Like a dawning of a new day, the internet is quickly sweeping away the darkness.
###3938 The truth will not be stopped.
###3946 We're in this strange reality,
###3949 which we're caught between two worlds,
###3951 between 2 paradigms.
###3953 And the bridge between,
###3955 or the door between these two paradigms is what is now called,
###3958 'The Disclosure Event'.
###3961 Recently in Washington D.C.,
###3962 a press conference was held in conjunction with an international event,
###3967 The X-Conference
###3968 Where a panel of eminent scientists and researchers broke the silence,
###3972 and spoke out and called for a full international disclosure
###3976 and an end to the truth embargo relative to UFOs and extraterrestrials.
###3981 If I was an 'in-the-know' person, high up in government or finance,
###3988 and I knew about the extraterrestrial issue,
###3990 and I knew about some extraterrestrial technology,
###3992 and I knew what it could do when it was released,
###3995 my position would be this:
###3997 Let's keep that technology under wraps as long as possible,
###4002 while we sell as much of the rest of the oil as we can,
###4006 for as much as possible.
###4008 And then we'll all take that money,
###4010 and we'll use that to own the extraterrestrial technology.
###4013 Alright.
###4014 The point is. There's always people 'in-the-know', and 'out-of-the-know'.
###4018 Sometimes it's about stuff, you know, you're in or you're out.
###4022 But there are some things you can't have, the 'in-the-know' and 'out-of-the-know'.
###4026 Basically, what we're calling on today,
###4030 is for the government of the United States,
###4033 to take the issue of extraterrestrial life,
###4038 where it has been stuck in conflict,
###4041 for the last 60 years, and take it out of the military intelligence agencies,
###4048 and put it into the department of education,
###4051 and the scientific departments, where it belongs.
###4055 Take it out of the threat scenario agencies,
###4058 where it is funded as a potential threat,
###4062 and put it into the opportunity agencies, where it is funded as
###4067 a matter of education and advancement of knowledge, for mutual benefit.
###4074 There is an overwhelming mass of proven,
###4077 real,
###4078 government documents, that have been released
###4081 largely, through the Freedom of Information Act,
###4084 that show decades of, for example,
###4088 airspace violations.
###4091 Very sensitive places by objects,
###4092 doing what appear to be, the impossible.
###4096 We have these documents from the 1940's.
###4098 We have them from the 1950's.
###4099 We have them from the 1960's, 70's, 80's and beyond.
###4103 So these airspace violations continue.
###4105 They are provocative.
###4106 They are at times, seemingly confrontational.
###4110 You have pilots who have been going,
###4112 who have been charged with going up to get these things,
###4114 and they have described them at times, saying, yes-
###4116 it appears to be a metallic disc shape, there it goes!
###4121 I began on this topic by trying to do reverse engineering on gravity control devices in 1968,
###4127 but now I'm officially looking at leaked question documents.
###4132 Some of the documents tell an amazing story.
###4135 One of the leaked documents started with F.D.R.
###4138 and F.D.R. had setup, through Vannevar Bush,
###4142 the committee called the non-terrestrial science and engineering committee.
###4145 These were the guys, after the recovery of a crashed flying saucer in 1942,
###4150 who were given the parts and were told to figure out how they worked.
###4155 They came back to F.D.R. in 1944, and asked for money.
###4159 And he said: No, we got to win the war first and beat the Nazis.
###4163 And then in 1947, it was Vannevar Bush who went to
###4168 President Truman, who didn't know about all of this, and said,
###4171 by the way, we have these craft, we could do some reverse engineering in order to
###4175 improve our country, to improve our culture, to improve our standard of living,
###4179 and that was when the money started to flow.
###4181 July 2002, right here in the Washington D.C. area,
###4186 there was, yet again, an airspace, jet chase.
###4190 By 2 F-16 jet interceptors,
###4192 which were chasing, a 'blue-ish' object, right outside D.C.
###4199 My opinion right now is, the person who is going to wait for hard evidence,
###4202 is going to be left behind when the delouse comes.
###4212 Exopolitics offers a bridge out of:
###4216 The permanent warfare state.
###4218 The permanent warfare economy.
###4221 Out of the permanent warfare industry,
###4224 into transforming the permanent warfare industry,
###4227 into a co-operative peaceful space age society,
###4232 integrated with universal society.
###4235 So I began to look outside of the, kind of, conventional sphere,
###4239 I began to explore theories,
###4240 for what it is that really is driving international politics.
###4244 And so then I came up with this area of an undisclosed,
###4249 extraterrestrial presence that is kept from the general public.
###4252 So that really did help me understand what was going on,
###4255 and what is driving international politics.
###4258 What's important is the structural blinders,
###4264 and the structural belief patterns,
###4267 and the structural paradigm,
###4270 if the Exopolitics model can come in,
###4275 and establish itself as the dominant paradigm,
###4279 such that, structurally, within Academia,
###4283 the Earth is no longer flat!
###4286 It is now round!
###4288 Intelligent life no longer ends at the geostationing orbit,
###4292 the universe is now, highly populated.
###4296 It's that sort of sea change that we need,
###4300 to unleash the huge public investment,
###4304 and private explosion of creativity and co-operation,
###4310 to turn our spaceship around, to be able to survive,
###4315 the environmental pressures,
###4318 that are coming now, which have been the result
###4322 of the embargo that we have been under.
###4333 Are we, the people of Earth, on the verge of technological destruction?
###4337 Has our use and testing of nuclear weapons,
###4340 already triggered an inter dimensional countdown,
###4343 that is now moving us as a planet,
###4345 towards some kind of interstellar intervention?
###4348 Even though there's clearly no evidence, I want to emphasize this,
###4351 that these extraterrestrial civilizations are hostile towards us,
###4355 I think they're very worried about our hostility.
###4358 I always turn this on it's head.
###4359 Because most of these sort of,
###4360 documentaries, you know, always like alien invasion and all this stuff,
###4363 No, no, no, no, no, no!
###4364 The issue is, if they were hostile, we would know it by now.
###4368 It's clear to me, that what's going on is that they're very concerned
###4371 that at the time that humanity reached the ability to go into space,
###4377 early space exploration, the 1950's, we also had already developed
###4381 weapons of mass destruction
###4382 and thermal nuclear hydrogen bombs and stuff.
###4385 And that the co-incidence of that, the coming together of those 2 things,
###4389 put a big red flag over Earth!
###4391 And so, if you look at the databases from the 50's, 60's, 70's, on forward,
###4395 not only in the United States, but in Great Britain,
###4397 in the Soviet Union, and in China,
###4400 that wherever we had space, aerospace and nuclear facilities,
###4405 there were allot of these so called, UFOs, being seen.
###4408 These groups, that are interested in us,
###4410 at least seem to show some benevolence,
###4413 I think, would probably step in and keep us
###4416 from blowing the hell out of ourselves, if push comes to shove.
###4420 The onset of the whole UFO phenomenon, beginning about 1946/47
###4426 I don't think it's co-incidence that
###4428 that coincided with our development of nuclear weapons.
###4431 And I think, that out in the universe, they were horrified.
###4434 They said, oh my God, the kids have found the matches!
###4439 Well they don't want us to destroy ourselves,
###4441 and they don't want us to destroy this planet,
###4443 and yet they're prohibited from directly,
###4447 intervening in our affairs and our evolution,
###4449 so I think that we've got crop circles, and animal mutilations and
###4453 abductions and sightings, and increasing sightings and all like that,
###4458 so that it's not directly impacting on us and yet over this conditioning period,
###4462 we are coming to understand, that we're not the only ones in the universe,
###4466 and I think they're trying to kind of, boost us up the evolutionary ladder,
###4471 so that we can grow to be full class members of the intergalactic community,
###4478 instead of destroying ourselves through our petty bickering wars, and nuclear holocaust.
###4485 Like a dawning of a new day, the internet is quickly sweeping away the darkness.
###4490 The truth will not be stopped.
###4493 We're now seeing this wall of censorship cracking apart in the United States.
###4498 Just recently, we had a
###4500 major T.V. network special,
###4503 and I found it absolutely amazing because, Peter Jennings of A.B.C., flat,
###4508 just very matter-of-factly told a national audience
###4512 that the Robertson Panel, of the 1950's,
###4515 and the Operation Bluebook, Project Bluebook, of the 1960's,
###4519 were not really scientific based investigations, they were just public relations efforts,
###4524 to try to get people not to be thinking about UFOs.
###4528 So in other words, all you folks out there who are old enough to have been,
###4532 seen all the newspaper reports on the Robertson Panel and heard what Bluebook said,
###4537 It was just hogwash, never mind!!
###4540 The non-human intelligence presence, has been here for a long time,
###4544 that, Colonel Philip Corso said there are 57 different races,
###4548 and that some accords were made to talk about their presence,
###4552 whether it be Hollywood movies or whatever, including the A.B.C. special,
###4556 that if it isn't done soon, they will probably do it!
###4561 Extraterrestrials are not a national security issue!
###4567 They're an educational and social issue for our society.
###4571 And they may be a spiritual issue!
###4574 When I retired from the military,
###4576 I went to work for the Federal Emergency Management Agency,
###4580 and I worked with them for 14 years.
###4582 So I've got 42 years of government service behind me,
###4585 and throughout all those years,
###4587 I had the very highest security classification you could have,
###4591 Top Secret.
###4592 When I was in N.A.T.O. in 1963, through 1967,
###4597 I had Cosmic Top Secret,
###4600 Which was and still is, the highest level of security in N.A.T.O.
###4606 That's how I got involved in this, this crazy UFO field!
###4610 Through the 1950's, 60's and 70's we referred to aliens as extraterrestrials,
###4616 but now that science has been catching up with us,
###4620 to a certain degree,
###4622 we have changed our definition, of an alien.
###4626 It's probably more accurate to call them extra dimensional beings.
###4631 Because that would explain their ability to traverse vast distances.
###4637 They operate in more dimensions,
###4638 I mean, even the current theoretical model of the universe,
###4643 is upwards of 30 dimensions!
###4647 So we're living in a multi dimensional universe.
###4649 And so it's not uncommon to theorize that we're going to encounter beings,
###4656 that operate in more dimensions than we do.
###4659 And that would explain allot of the phenomenon related to UFOs.
###4663 How they're able to appear and disappear, move very fast,
###4667 do all the things that the E.T.s do, walk through walls,
###4671 have remarkable psychic abilities,
###4673 and communicate telepathically,
###4676 It would really go a long way to explain the phenomenon surrounding it.
###4680 What looks like magic to us, can really be explained,
###4683 through extra dimensionality.
###4685 Are any of us really prepared for the kind of paradigm shift
###4689 that would come with not just disclosure,
###4692 but with contact and communication with intelligences from other worlds?
###4696 Is it possible,
###4697 that as a species we have reached the point that our minds
###4700 actually filter and generate acceptable constructs,
###4703 which all too often become our day to day realities?
###4708 There is so little of your reality that is really based on truth,
###4716 that it is just, stunning!
###4722 I heard that there are other worlds that are inhabited.
###4727 and Father Rapile answered,
###4747 Would you believe that it would just be our tiny world that would be giving glory to God?
###4752 There has to be many more worlds, many more planets,
###4755 that exist, with inhabitants that would be giving glory to God, it is not just us.
###4761 If I told you that uh,
###4763 you know, the very nature of the Moon and Mars
###4765 and most of the planets in the Solar System
###4768 is being kept from you for specific reasons,
###4770 to make you think that you're completely alone,
###4772 and that these planets can't be colonized.
###4773 Back in the 1950's, the big question was:
###4776 Do they come from Mars?
###4777 Or do they come from Venus?
###4780 And by the 1960's and 70's we had gotten a little more
###4783 sophisticated in our intellect and in our thinking,
###4786 and the question became:
###4787 Well, do they come from Alfa Centauri?
###4790 or Zeta Reticula 4? You know.
###4793 Now up to the day, and we've gotten even more sophisticated,
###4797 and now the question is:
###4798 Do they come from another planet?
###4800 Or do they come from another dimension?
###4802 Or are they perhaps time travelers?
###4804 Do they come from another time? OK.
###4807 And in my study of all of this,
###4809 I have kind of come to the conclusion that the answer,
###4813 is, YES!
###4815 The more you know about this field, it becomes almost paralyzing.
###4818 Because the more you know, the less you know.
###4820 The more you know, and the more open minded that you are about this,
###4825 the more you realize that every answer you find, just leads to,
###4828 you know, a thousand more questions.
###4830 Vast sums of money are being siphoned through these different agencies,
###4835 into the coffers of the C.I.A., which then forwards this money onto the D.O.D.
###4841 and this money is funneled through the D.O.D. and goes into the Black Projects,
###4846 which the D.O.D. has direct oversight over.
###4850 So the C.I.A. is kind of like the bagman, that collects the money.
###4853 It goes to the Department of Defense, that actually administers
###4856 how this money is going to be spent on different Black Projects.
###4859 So, the size. How much are we talking about?
###4862 I think the best indication for just how much we are talking about here,
###4866 are the auditing irregularities that the Inspector General of the D.O.D.
###4871 has himself identified.
###4872 He identified, in 3 years, it was 1998, 1999, and the year 2000.
###4881 In those 3 years, he identified,
###4884 on average, 1.7 trillion dollars,
###4887 could not be accounted for,
###4889 in the Department of Defense budget.
###4891 In other words, this was money that was being moved around
###4895 in ways that could not be accounted for.
###4897 And I think, what that indicates is, the true size of the Black budget.
###4902 We're looking at an infrastructure,
###4905 that is funded by as much as,
###4906 1.7 trillion dollars a year.
###4909 Now when you consider that the whole D.O.D. budget, officially,
###4912 is just over 400 billion dollars,
###4917 We're talking about a vast infrastructure,
###4919 that is,
###4919 Four times greater than the entire D.O.D. budget!
###4924 As Jack Nicholson would say: You can't handle the truth!
###4927 Is it possible that ancient and secret societies exist,
###4930 that have always had the real, but hidden information?
###4934 And have they, as a result of their ongoing familial knowledge,
###4937 been manipulating and governing,
###4939 virtually all countries down through the centuries?
###4942 Researchers point to the Illuminati,
###4945 and the power elite and their use of propaganda,
###4947 as carried by the mainstream media.
###4950 Many believe that these powerful few actually control almost all information,
###4954 by implanting false knowledge and beliefs into our human collective reality.
###4959 Essentially, everything that you would want to know has been covered up.
###4963 From the electro genetic magnificence of your DNA,
###4967 being a spiritual antenna to the creator,
###4970 to the most amazing, perfagering mystery score mathematics,
###4974 that is essentially freeing to humanity,
###4976 in essence, also very, very clear,
###4980 that everything in our world, is a divine creation,
###4985 where as the math is the expressive tool of the creator for creationism.
###4990 The United States government, the leader of the free world,
###4993 is totally controlled by a wealthy oligarchy,
###4997 a small, handful of people,
###4998 that are just super rich.
###5000 Most of them are not even in government.
###5002 But they tell the government what to do.
###5005 These are the people who are behind the UFO secrecy.
###5009 They don't care if you know there's E.T.s out there,
###5013 but if you know there's E.T.s out there,
###5015 then you will know that there is alternative technology.
###5021 And this could upset the monopolies,
###5024 over energy, fuel, transportation, communications, pharmaceuticals.
###5030 And that's what they don't want.
###5032 After all,
###5033 who would continue to pay all these ever increasing prices for gasoline,
###5038 that’s polluting the air,
###5039 choking us all,
###5041 killing our kids.
###5042 Why would we do that if we knew, beyond any shadow of a doubt,
###5046 that there was non-polluting energy sources out there?
###5050 This is what it's all about.
###5051 It comes back to the old journalistic adage.
###5054 Follow the money.
###5056 Everything has been covered up.
###5058 Toxicities of the pharmaceuticals.
###5061 You're not learning the truth about vaccinations.
###5063 You're not learning the truth about various medications.
###5065 The pharmaceutical industrialists,
###5068 which I prefer to call the,
###5069 Military Medical Petrochemical Pharmaceutical Cartel!
###5074 Essentially has control of the media, the mainstream media.
###5077 And so it has control over the mass mind.
###5080 And as a result of those powers that they assert,
###5084 people are not given factual information
###5087 upon which to make informed decisions.
###5089 They're given propaganda.
###5091 And as a result, the choices that people are making are genocidal.
###5096 And I say genocidal with a strict definition, meaning,
###5099 the mass killing of people for economic, political and/or ideological reasons.
###5104 And those pharmaceutical industrialists are
###5107 intimately connected to those people who wish to control populations.
###5111 They've published literature of what their intent is.
###5114 Not only how best to control populations, why populations need to be controlled,
###5119 but ultimately, affecting the technologies that are in place to do just that
###5124 Currently, a 50% reduction in general,
###5127 of the planets population has been targeted for illimination.
###5131 The Disclosure Project is oriented towards putting together
###5133 credible government documents and these witnesses, so that
###5137 there is an undeniable case made that this is real and not fictitious.
###5141 It started really in 19... the early 1990's.
###5144 After I had briefed President Clinton's first C.I.A. director of this problem.
###5150 It was made very clear to me that the executive branch,
###5152 of the U.S. government, did not want to do this because,
###5155 I'm quoting.
###5156 "The President was concerned he would end up like Jack Kennedy."
###5159 And I'm not kidding.
###5160 That was said to me by President Clinton's closest friend.
###5162 Could it be that much of what we believe is illusion?
###5166 Is it possible that the history of human civilization is not as we have been told?
###5171 Have we as people, been purposefully dumbed down?
###5175 And, have our governments only served to strengthen the bonds,
###5178 that bind us to our ignorance?
###5180 Not only of our past, but of our present and potential future?
###5185 Officials in these agencies no longer represent the best interests of humanity,
###5189 but are now representing the interests of a particular extraterrestrial race,
###5193 that they have been compromised by.
###5195 So we pay a heavy price if we don't make this open.
###5199 If we don't bring in transparency and accountability,
###5201 into this whole process,
###5203 it means that we don’t know whether or not,
###5206 those that are behind the policies,
###5208 are actually implementing these policies for the best
###5211 interest of humanity, which is what they claim,
###5214 or for the best interest of a particular extraterrestrial race.
###5217 Some of the questions that we must ask include:
###5220 Are there bases on our moon?
###5222 Are there structures and life forms on Mars,
###5225 and many of the other local planets?
###5227 Have our governments made deals and treaties with other life forms,
###5230 that affect the future of all of us on planet Earth?
###5241 These people will continue, zipping through our atmosphere
###5247 checking our nuclear plants and so forth and so on.
###5251 They have never been hostile.
###5253 They pose no air security problems, whatever.
###5258 The Air force knows this and the Air force has made statements to that effect.
###5262 That UFOs pose NO threat.
###5266 THEY ARE HERE.
###5268 Not just the Greys, but the others, who look and act like us.
###5273 Perhaps they are here to instruct us.
###5275 To help us safeguard our planet.
###5277 Definitely rules and regulations are governing everything.
###5282 And the councils have the history books
###5284 of all the planets and all of the records.
###5287 So when a planet reaches the point that it can support life,
###5291 That's a very momentous time in the history of that planet.
###5296 At that time, the planet is given it's life charter.
###5299 We're dealing with a BIG, BIG story.
###5303 It's not just them.
###5305 As I've said, if it was that simple,
###5307 it would have probably been out some time back.
###5310 It's really about us.
###5312 It's who we are, what we are, how we came to be.
###5315 and where we might end up going, sometime.
###5319 Life is never allowed to just simply spontaneously develop.
###5324 If it did, it would be very chaotic.
###5327 If we could integrate,
###5329 I call it the spiritual, but the esoteric or whatever.
###5332 But I mean true esoteric, I don't mean religion necessarily,
###5335 because there is a difference I think, between religion and spirituality.
###5338 To produce a thinking, intelligent human being,
###5341 would have taken millions more years,
###5343 than what's happening by normal evolution,
###5347 than it would have taken.
###5348 and it would have still, not of got to the point we are now.
###5351 They create life on other planets, because this is the way they were created.
###5356 By what they called the Archaic ones, the ones' from the very beginning,
###5361 have been doing this forever.
###5363 Mankind was developed as a species, as a spiritual being.
###5367 And I think we've gotten so far away from who we really are,
###5370 that it's very hard for us to go back there and digest,
###5374 that maybe we have cosmic brothers and sisters.
###5376 We fight among ourselves for diversity.
###5379 I mean, if anybody walks in here and looks totally different
###5381 we fight among ourselves.
###5382 Now I'm thinking, oh my God!
###5384 What are the E.T.s that are involved, thinking about,
###5387 the way we handle ourselves, with people that are so different from us,
###5390 They're probably scared to death to appear because of what we might do to them.
###5394 We have not handled diversity very well.
###5397 One day, I would hope that the people of Earth,
###5403 would stand up and extend their hand in friendship
###5406 to these people, we have never done that here on this planet.
###5410 You know, we've shot at them.
###5413 We've done everything. We've fired radar, we've fired lasers, everything.
###5417 We need to say.......Hi!
###5420 There are other extraterrestrial groups who are human looking,
###5424 such as the Pleiadians, the famous Pleiadians of Billy Meyer and others.
###5428 And they are much more intent on trying to assist humanity, to
###5434 become free of this kind of manipulation from,
###5437 other races, that really try to use humanity as a resource.
###5441 Let's think about it.
###5442 You can't say, whoopee! Star kids!
###5444 These wonderful advanced children have been transformed by
###5447 contact with people from the stars,
###5449 when in the same breath you say, there's no such things as UFOs.
###5453 The question of UFOs and extraterrestrials,
###5455 most people just think is something entertaining.
###5457 In reality, it's something that is central to
###5461 how we're going to be able to go forward as a civilization.
###5464 Because that issue involves,
###5467 sciences, technologies, energy and propulsion systems,
###5470 that could give us a whole new civilization.
###5473 It's terribly important the whole thing come apart,
###5474 because it's all one package,
###5476 and it's part of our bright and very,
###5478 I think, hopeful future.
###5480 And I think of these star kids growing up and being our leaders.
###5482 Our presidents, congress people, senators.
###5485 University professors.
###5489 Leaders in medicine and science and so forth.
###5493 I think what brilliant and expansive future we're going to have,
###5497 but we have to get from point A to point B, and
###5500 this cover-up is just stultifying us in a very painful way.
###5504 Is it possible that an intergalactic federation exists,
###5508 and that this collective of different member beings,
###5510 are in the process of offering the people of Earth,
###5513 membership in a federation of planets?
###5516 Most importantly for all of us and our children,
###5519 some of these researchers say,
###5520 that acceptance of their invitation to federation membership,
###5524 would end all war,
###5526 starvation and dependency upon fossil fuel based energy systems,
###5530 for our entire planet.
###5533 Part of the problem with the UFO cover-up coming apart;
###5535 You've got to uncover the whole thing at the same time.
###5537 You can't half uncover it.
###5539 People who try, they only look stupid!
###5546 but, they are doing it for us, they are praying for us!
###5555 We are the lowest of the category in the evolutionary scale.
###5560 He really believes that humanity is the lowest of the category of the evolutionary scale.
###5565 With all the proof that he gave you of the ecological problem,
###5568 of the war problem,
###5570 of the, choosing evil problem, and all that.
###5573 This is his belief system.
###5575 We all have a responsibility to find out what the truth is about something like this.
###5579 People have to take responsibility for looking into what the truth is.
###5583 We've put together the means, for people to do that.
###5586 Now, people have to take the initiative.
###5587 And we need all the help we can get!
###5589 I would ask people to help us network this to,
###5591 anyone and any institution that can help.
###5595 The reason this is so critical, is that-
###5597 We've reached a point in our civilization,
###5599 where, for us to go forward, as a people,
###5603 we're going to have to end this kind of illegal secrecy.
###5606 And we're going to have to allow this information and these technologies,
###5610 to get out and begin to fix many of these large problems.
###5614 I've always believed our destiny is in the stars.
###5619 That's a hope that I have.
###5621 Generations yet to come, will travel out there.
###5625 And we'll become a part of that community.
###5630 That's a dream that I won't live to see, but,
###5633 it's a dream I hold dear.
###5636 That we'll make it.
###5638 That we will survive as a species.
###5642 Because I think we've got some,
###5644 I jokingly say, we have some good friends in high places.
