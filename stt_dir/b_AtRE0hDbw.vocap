###2 MING: Good afternoon, my friends.
###4 My mane is Ming, and I'm delighted today
###6 to introduce my friend the renowned social psychologist
###10 David DeSteno and the author of this book, "The Truth About
###13 Trust."
###15 I first got to know David-- thank you, Dana.
###19 I first got to know David through his highly innovative
###21 work in studying the science of compassion, which
###25 is a topic I'm very passionate about.
###28 David and his lab, they are renowned for devising
###31 very creative methods in studying
###34 how emotional states affect behavior.
###37 And they are also known for studying moral behavior
###40 in real time.
###42 Real time, not fake time like the other labs, real time.
###47 David is most interested to figure out
###50 how to foster prosocial behavior all around the world.
###55 And he told me that in summary his work
###58 can be summarised in three words, vice and virtue.
###63 Vice and virtue, there's one that I prefer over the other.
###67 And with that, my friends, let's please welcome my friend
###70 David DeSteno.
###70 
###75 DAVID DESTENO: And thank you for having me.
###77 It's a real honor to be with you here and share
###79 this work with you.
###80 And as you can probably guess by the title today,
###82 I'm going to talk about trust.
###85 I think it probably comes as no surprise to you
###87 that issues and dilemmas of trust pervade our lives.
###91 Trust determines who we want to work with, who we love
###95 and who would marry, who we trust to learn from,
###99 who we'll go to for support.
###102 Now, we all can remember the big stuff,
###103 the times trust really matters.
###105 Is a new business partner going to be trustworthy,
###108 or is he going to skim profits?
###110 Is a spouse being faithful or unfaithful?
###114 Is a child using drugs even when she swears, trust me.
###117 Trust me.
###118 Trust me.
###118 I'm not.
###119 But issues of trust aren't just about those potentially
###122 momentous situations.
###124 Issues of trust pervade our common daily life.
###127 Will my neighbor remember and I trust him to really feed my dog
###131 while I'm away, or am I going to come home and the dog's hungry?
###134 The mechanic, is he really being honest when
###136 he says my car need a new transmission?
###139 Was the salesperson when I bought this suit really honest
###141 when he told me it makes me look thin?
###144 You can tell me.
###145 I don't know.
###145 I won't comment on that.
###146 But whether it's big or whether it's small,
###149 what all of these issues have in common is a simple dynamic.
###152 They really depend on trust.
###154 And we know the more we trust individuals,
###158 we can gain a lot more by working
###160 together and cooperating.
###162 But in reality, as you probably can guess,
###164 trust is a double-edged sword.
###166 Yes, we can gain more by working together.
###168 That's why we have trust in the first place.
###170 But trusting somebody also makes us vulnerable to that person.
###175 It means that our outcomes are dependent on them being
###177 competent, on them having integrity,
###179 on them working with us.
###182 And so given that trust is so central to human life,
###186 you would hope, you would like to think that we really
###189 understand how it works, that we can make really good decisions
###192 about who we should trust or whether we're
###194 going to be trustworthy ourselves.
###196 But I'm here to tell you we're not really good about that.
###198 And until recently, the science underlying that
###200 hasn't been really good about it.
###202 And so in some ways, that's what led me to write this book.
###206 As a scientist, I really wanted to work
###207 on correcting a lot of the misconceptions that
###210 are out there to empower people to make better
###213 decisions but also so that we can work together
###217 to nudge us all to nudge society to become more
###220 trustworthy and cooperative overall.
###223 So to do that, you have to start like you
###225 would with anything else.
###226 You have to get rid of the misconceptions
###227 and figure out how trust really works.
###230 And so that's what I want to talk about today in general.
###233 In the book, I talk about lots of issues
###234 that I'm not going to talk about today.
###235 We talk about issues of how trust
###237 affects learning and academic success.
###239 One of the best predictors of a child's academic success
###243 isn't how much they like their teacher.
###245 It's how much they trust their teacher.
###247 And they trust that the teacher is
###248 competent in telling them and giving them information.
###251 We talk about how trust affects our relationships
###254 and especially romantic ones and how
###256 it can function to smooth out the bumps in those in ways that
###259 operate even below our conscious awareness
###261 to keep harmony with those we love.
###264 In the book, I talk about how trust
###265 is affected by power and money.
###267 There's great work out there showing
###268 that people's trustworthiness tracks socioeconomic status.
###272 This is work by my friend Paul Piff.
###273 He's a psychologist at Berkeley where
###275 he shows that higher SES correlates
###277 to increased untrustworthiness.
###280 But really it's not about being in the 1%.
###283 It's not a birthright of the 1% that makes you untrustworthy.
###285 It's simply about money and power
###288 relative to those around you.
###290 And so any of you, if we put you in a position
###292 even for 10 minutes where you feel elevated sense of power,
###295 it becomes a lot more difficult in some ways
###298 to actually be trustworthy.
###300 And also how and when can you trust yourself?
###302 It's already February.
###303 A lot of New Year's resolutions have gone by the wayside,
###306 so if it's a good thing to know.
###308 But today what I want to talk about is three broader themes.
###311 And the first is what does it mean to be trustworthy
###313 and how can we understand how trust operates within ourselves
###316 and our own trustworthiness?
###318 The second is can we actually detect
###321 whether somebody else is going to be trustworthy?
###323 In some ways, this has been the holy grail
###325 of governmental research and security research.
###328 And we've been pretty bad at it.
###329 But I have some new data I want to share
###331 with you that suggests we can do it.
###333 And then finally, the question that's probably
###335 closest to my heart in the work that I normally do,
###337 which is, how can we increase trustworthiness and thereby
###340 increase our own and each other's resilience around us?
###344 So let's start with the first question.
###348 Most of us, when we think about trust,
###349 we think about it as this stable trait.
###353 A person's trustworthy or they're not.
###356 But I want to convince you that that's probably
###359 not the best way to think about it.
###361 That's not how it really works.
###363 Growing up, we have this idea that it's a typical motif,
###366 right?
###367 You see it in cartoons all the time.
###368 There's an angel on one shoulder and a devil on the other,
###371 and they whisper into your ears.
###372 And if you grow up listening to the angel,
###374 well then you're going to be a good person.
###376 You're going to be trustworthy.
###377 Everybody is going to love you.
###378 Everything's going to be good.
###379 There's just one problem with that.
###382 And that is if you actually look at the scientific data,
###387 it doesn't really hold up.
###388 What we've learned over the past decade especially
###391 in psychological science is that people's moral behavior
###393 is a lot more variable than any of us would have expected.
###396 And it's a lot more influenced by the situation.
###399 And so if you want to control your own behavior
###401 and predict the behavior of those around you,
###402 you need to realize that it's not a stable trait.
###405 You need to understand how it's affected by the situation.
###409 And so my model for understanding trustworthiness,
###413 it's better to think of it as a scale, the old school
###416 type of type with the plates that go up
###418 and down as opposed to a digital one.
###420 In any one moment, your mind, whether you know it or not,
###424 is weighing two types of cost.
###426 It's weighing costs and benefits in the short term
###430 versus costs and benefits in the long term.
###432 And those usually correlate with what's good for me
###434 in an expedient fashion right now versus what's good for me
###438 to do even if it costs me in the moment to built a reputation
###442 and to build social bonds in the long term.
###445 And depending upon the situation, which decision you
###449 choose can change from moment to moment.
###452 You can think about it.
###453 If my friend Ming loans me money,
###456 in the moment if I don't pay him back, well, I'm ahead.
###459 I've profited in the short term.
###460 But long term, it's probably a poor decision
###462 because he's not going to give me money again.
###464 I'm going to get a reputation as being a cheater.
###466 But if I can get away with it, my mind,
###468 unbeknownst to me and my own moral codes that I endorse,
###471 will try to push me to be a bit untrustworthy.
###475 And so I want to suggest to all of you
###477 who think this can't happen to me
###479 and that you are completely honest
###481 and trustworthy and wonderful, it can happen to any of us.
###485 And let me show you an example of how it happens
###487 and also why you probably don't think it's true of you
###490 even though it is.
###492 So the first issue is how do you study trustworthiness?
###495 I can't really walk around with a clipboard and say, Cindy,
###497 are you a trustworthy person?
###499 Because what people will probably say is they'll
###501 do one of two things.
###502 Either they know they're not and they'll, yes I am.
###504 Because who wants to say I'm not?
###505 But what happens more frequently is
###509 they think they are, and they predict they will be,
###511 but when push comes to shove, time and again our behavior
###513 isn't what we expect.
###515 And so the way that we have to study trustworthiness is not
###518 by asking people or looking at their past reputations
###521 but by staging events in real time as opposed
###524 to fake time where we can actually see when push comes
###528 to shove, what will people actually do
###531 when real rewards are on the line?
###533 So let me give you an example of how we do this.
###536 So we set up an experiment in our lab to look at this,
###538 and it's rather simple.
###540 We bring people into the lab.
###541 These are normal community members
###544 or even undergraduates from the Boston community
###547 all known to be trustworthy people.
###549 We bring them in and say, look, we've
###551 got two tasks that need to be done.
###553 One is really long and onerous and it's
###556 these terrible logic problems, and circling letters
###561 E, and random digit strings, and all the things
###563 that you would feel like is a big waste of your time.
###566 Or you can do a fun photo hunt on the computer.
###572 Here's a coin.
###573 I want you to flip the coin, and whatever one you get,
###577 it will determine whether you do the photo hunt or the logic
###580 problems.
###580 And whichever one you don't do, the person
###582 sitting in the next room is going to get.
###586 And we're going to trust you to do this the right way.
###589 Is that OK?
###589 They say sure.
###591 And then we let them go.
###592 What do you think happens?
###593 
###596 A lot of people just assign themselves to the good task.
###600 Any guesses for how many?
###603 80%?
###605 Close, 90%.
###607 We've done this many, many times.
###609 So it's not a fluke finding.
###610 We've done it in our lab.
###611 Other people have copied the methodology.
###613 90% of people-- well they do one other thing.
###615 Some of them don't flip the coin and just
###617 say, oh, I got the good task when they come out.
###619 Or some of them, because we have them on hidden video,
###621 flip the coin repeatedly until they get the answer they want,
###625 which is the same as not flipping at all.
###627 But they feel better about themselves.
###629 And so these are people who we asked them
###631 before, if you don't flip the coin, is that untrustworthy?
###634 They said, oh, it would be terribly untrustworthy.
###636 But they do it.
###637 And if you ask them when they come out,
###639 we have them rate on a computer how trustworthily they
###643 just acted.
###643 So here higher numbers mean higher trust
###645 on a one to seven scale.
###647 So when they're judging themselves doing this,
###650 they're above the midpoint.
###651 So they say, yeah, it was OK.
###653 I was trustworthy.
###655 If you take those same people and you now
###657 have them watch somebody else do this,
###660 they condemn the person for it.
###662 That person was not trustworthy.
###664 When I did it, it was OK.
###665 When that person did it, they're definitely not trustworthy.
###669 Now, the interesting thing about this
###672 is these were people who are normal people.
###677 And so when we see people like Lance Armstrong or Bernie
###679 Madoff, you think, oh, it's something wrong.
###681 Those people are morally corrupt and untrustworthy.
###686 No, well, yes what they did was untrustworthy.
###689 But the same process-- on a smaller scale, of course,
###691 and we can only study on a smaller scale in the lab--
###694 happens with us.
###695 It happens with any of you.
###696 Now, the question is, well, why don't we realize this?
###700 Why don't we learn to stop trusting ourselves?
###702 Well, the reason why is our mind whitewashes our own behavior.
###707 So if you ask these subjects, why did you not flip the coin?
###712 They'll say things.
###713 They'll create stores like, well, yeah, I should have,
###716 but today I was late for an appointment.
###718 And if I'm not there, somebody depending on me.
###720 And so it was OK.
###721 So they'll create all kinds of justifications
###723 for why it was OK for them in the situation
###725 and how it doesn't reflect on the fact
###727 that they're an untrustworthy person
###728 but they can be untrustworthy.
###730 Now, in some way that's a good thing.
###732 It has to be adaptive, because if any of us
###735 felt like we couldn't trust ourselves,
###738 that alternative is much worse.
###739 Because it means we're not going to save money for the future
###742 because we know future us is going to go blow it a casino.
###745 We're not going to diet and take care of our health
###748 because we assume three days from now
###749 I'm going to gorge on ice cream or chocolate cake.
###752 We're stuck with ourselves.
###753 If somebody else is untrustworthy,
###755 we can stop interacting with them.
###757 We can't stop interacting with ourself,
###759 and so we need to trust ourselves even
###761 when we make mistakes.
###763 So that's OK, but what I'm here to do
###764 is to help you try and learn that
###765 so that you can decrease the probability that you're
###768 actually going to make those mistakes.
###769 But what I haven't told you yet is
###771 that there's any evidence that people actually
###773 recognize what they did was wrong.
###776 So let me give you an example.
###778 So in psychology we had this method
###780 which is called cognitive load.
###782 And it's a way to kind of tie up people's mental resources
###784 so they can engage in rationalization.
###787 And the way it works is we give them
###788 random digit strings of numbers, say like seven digits.
###791 And you have to remember these digits.
###793 So what we're doing is you'll get a string of numbers,
###795 and you'll have to say 7-6-5-4-1-0, 7-6-5-4-1-0,
###798 and then you'll have to answer a question,
###800 how trustworthily did you just act?
###802 And you have to remember these numbers because I'm
###803 going to have you enter them in a minute,
###804 and you've got to get them right.
###806 And so what this does is it ties up your mind.
###808 It prevents your mind from engaging in rationalization.
###811 So when we did this experiment again,
###813 and we have 90% of people who did cheat even though they said
###817 they wouldn't, what you find is on the white bars
###822 on the bottom, those who were under cognitive load,
###824 there's no difference in how you judge yourself
###827 or how you judge others.
###828 And those are significantly less.
###829 You see yourself as less trustworthy
###831 than when you have the time to rationalize.
###833 So the second, the moment that you're
###835 committing the transgression, your mind knows it.
###838 You feel in your gut.
###841 You feel that pang of guilt.
###843 But what happens is you don't want
###844 to think of yourself as untrustworthy.
###846 And so your mind engages in this rationalization.
###850 The good you tamps away, tamps down the guilt so
###853 that it can create a view of you.
###855 Well, I had a reason, and it's OK.
###858 And I am trustworthy.
###860 So the point is to remember that all of us,
###862 even if we think of ourselves as trustworthy,
###864 I'm sure most of you in general are trustworthy,
###866 but your mind is making these calculations.
###868 Here when we gave them anonymity-- or at least
###870 they thought they were anonymous.
###872 They didn't know we have them on hidden video-- their mind's
###874 impulses for short-term gain created a story.
###877 It pushed them to say, well, I can get away with it now.
###880 Even not consciously, it just pushes
###881 them to make this decision as an impulsive way.
###884 And then they justify it because the long-term consequences
###887 they believe are not there, because they
###889 believe they're anonymous.
###890 
###893 Let's turn to the second question.
###896 The second question is, can I trust you?
###900 How do you figure, how do you determine
###903 that question about somebody?
###904 Now, as we all know, human society
###907 flourishes when we cooperate with each other
###911 and when we trust each other.
###913 The problem is if one person doesn't
###915 uphold his or her end of the bargain,
###919 that person can gain at the other's expense.
###921 And so what you have is a very dynamic yet delicate balance
###924 that we every day have to navigate through and optimize
###928 our outcomes.
###929 If we make the wrong decision over and over again,
###933 we're going to have a problem.
###935 So here what we try to do is we try to use people's reputation.
###939 Now, as I just told you, reputation
###942 isn't a great predictor, and so often we're wrong.
###945 But the problem that confronts us other times
###947 is sometimes we have to decide if we're
###949 going to trust somebody new who we don't know anything about.
###952 And we don't know their reputation,
###953 yet we're negotiating with them.
###955 What do you do there?
###956 You have the opportunity for establishing
###958 a long-term relationship or you have the opportunity
###960 for being screwed over in a way that you couldn't predict.
###964 And if you're wrong, well, time and time again that's
###967 going to cause you a lot of problems.
###970 It's a very non-optimal outcome to be wrong.
###975 So given all that, it would be nice
###977 if we could actually detect if somebody else was
###979 going to be trustworthy.
###981 Now, as I said at the beginning of this talk,
###983 people have been looking for the Holy Grail of what
###985 signifies deception or untrustworthiness
###987 for a long time.
###989 Is it a true smile?
###991 Does that mean I can trust you?
###992 Is it shifty eyes?
###993 Does that mean I can't trust you?
###996 And the TSA spent $40 million on this program
###999 to look for these single microexpressions
###1002 that in GAO testimony before Congress
###1005 has been shown to be utterly useless.
###1008 And the problem is I think the reason why we haven't found how
###1011 we can detect trustworthiness is we've been going about it
###1014 in really the wrong way.
###1016 There is not going to be one marker.
###1018 There is not going to be one golden cue.
###1021 Cues to trustworthiness are going to be subtle and dynamic.
###1023 Why is that the case?
###1025 Well, it's very adaptive if I'm standing here
###1029 and you're looking and me and all of a sudden I
###1031 see a major threat behind you to show fear.
###1034 Because that lets you know even without turning around
###1037 very quickly, there's something dangerous there.
###1039 But trust isn't something that you
###1041 want to communicate very easily or untrustworthiness.
###1044 Why?
###1044 I mean, imagine if you're trustworthy person
###1047 and you had a clear tell.
###1049 It's like walking around with a big T on your forehead
###1052 that says, I'm trustworthy.
###1053 What would happen?
###1056 Everybody would want to cooperate with you,
###1058 more of them so they could probably take advantage of you
###1060 because they know they could.
###1061 Or if you were untrustworthy and you walked around with a big U
###1064 on your forehead, well, everybody would ignore you.
###1066 And nobody would cooperate with you.
###1067 And your outcomes would be poor.
###1069 And so trust signals have to be played close to the vest.
###1072 We have to interact with each other.
###1074 I can get a feeling for you.
###1075 You can get a feeling for me.
###1076 And then we can decide and reveal our cards very slowly.
###1080 So they're going to be subtle and dynamic.
###1081 They're also going to be the context dependent.
###1083 What signals trust in any one specific culture may vary.
###1087 What signals trust in any one situation may vary.
###1090 Think about it.
###1090 There's different kinds of trust.
###1092 There's integrity.
###1093 So can I trust that you're going to do
###1096 the best job you can to help me?
###1098 Are you meaning well toward me?
###1100 That's different than trusting your competence.
###1103 If you don't have the competence to help me,
###1105 all the intention in the world is going to be useless.
###1109 And so the cues I look for for competence versus integrity
###1112 may be very different, and we have to think about that.
###1114 But the main reason why I think we haven't
###1116 found the cues to trust is that they're going to occur in sets.
###1119 I mean, think about it, right?
###1122 If touching my face means I'm going to be untrustworthy,
###1125 if I do this, am I doing that because I've got an itch
###1129 or because I'm going to cheat you?
###1131 Don't know by one thing.
###1132 You can't tell.
###1134 The only way you can begin to read cues to trustworthiness
###1137 is to look for them occurring in sets so you can disambiguate
###1139 the meaning of any single one.
###1142 And that's what the field typically doesn't do.
###1144 And so I'm going to quickly tell you about two experiments
###1147 that we did to show how trust can be read.
###1149 The first one is kind of exploratory.
###1151 We threw out everything that we had known before,
###1153 and we simply started to try and identify what cues actually
###1156 predict real monetary trustworthy behavior
###1160 and to demonstrate that they do this in an accurate way.
###1163 And the second part was designed to actually confirm
###1167 in a very tightly controlled, highly precise way
###1171 that these are the cues that matter.
###1173 And I'll show you what I mean by that in a second.
###1176 We have an exploratory phase and a confirmatory phase.
###1180 So how did we do this I will start
###1182 with the exploratory phase.
###1184 What are candidates for signals related to trust?
###1188 Well, we brought 86 people into the lab
###1192 and we put them into dyads, which are groups of two.
###1194 The only requirement is you couldn't know the person
###1197 with whom you were now going to interact.
###1200 We gave them five minutes to have a get-to-know-you
###1203 conversation.
###1203 You could talk about anything you want.
###1206 We gave them a list of topics, but they
###1208 could talk about anything they wanted.
###1210 And you're going to play a game for real money, a game that
###1213 pits self-interest versus being trustworthy, communal interest.
###1217 And I'll show you how the game works in a second.
###1219 And then we gave them topics to start,
###1220 but they could talk about anything that they wanted.
###1223 So we brought them in.
###1224 They simply sat across from each other
###1226 at a table, half the subjects.
###1228 And we had three cameras on them that were time
###1230 locked so we could record every single gesture,
###1234 every single cue they made.
###1236 Now, we also had another group of subjects
###1239 who conversed in their get to know you
###1241 in separate rooms over Google Chat
###1244 or Gchat-- any type of internet chat.
###1247 And the logic for this is the same amount of information
###1251 is being exchanged in the conversation,
###1252 but in one condition you have access
###1254 to the person's nonverbal cues.
###1257 In the other you don't.
###1259 And then we brought them into separate rooms
###1261 if they weren't in separate rooms already.
###1263 And we said, you're going to play this game.
###1265 We gave each of them four tokens.
###1268 And the tokens are worth $1 to each of them
###1271 but $2 to their partner.
###1274 And so this game is called the give some game.
###1276 And it's a nice analog for self-interest
###1278 versus communal interest.
###1279 Because if you want to be selfish,
###1281 you can try and get the other person to give you all of his
###1283 and give nothing.
###1284 And that means you'll have $12 and he'll have nothing.
###1288 But the most trustworthy thing to do if you really
###1290 implicitly trust each other and want to benefit each other
###1292 is to exchange all you have at the same time,
###1294 because then you all started with four
###1296 and now you have eight.
###1297 And so we had people making real decisions
###1300 and we paid them accordingly.
###1302 And we also had them tell us what
###1303 they thought their partner was going to do.
###1306 Now, the nice thing about it was whether or not
###1309 you talked to your partner over an internet chat
###1313 or face to face, the amount of trustworthy behavior
###1316 didn't change, which is nice.
###1318 I think it's because people are now becoming very used
###1320 to communicating over internet mediated platforms.
###1324 And so it's not like being face to face
###1325 made people more trustworthy.
###1327 There was people who were cheating and being
###1329 cooperative at equal levels in both cases.
###1331 But here the axis is error, the amount that you were off.
###1337 And so lower bars mean accuracy in terms of absolute value.
###1341 If you were in the presence of the other person,
###1344 your guess for how much that person
###1346 was going to be trustworthy or cheat you in absolute dollars
###1349 was significantly greater.
###1351 So what this tells us is that people are picking up on a cue.
###1355 There is some information there that your mind is gleaning
###1358 from body language, whether you know it or not.
###1361 And so what we did next was we ran
###1363 models of all these possible combinations of cues
###1366 to see what would matter.
###1367 And the model that predicted untrustworthiness
###1371 the best consisted of four cues, touching your hands,
###1375 touching your face, crossing your arms, and leaning away.
###1378 If you think about it, what does this really mean?
###1380 Well, we know from the nonverbal literature
###1382 that fidgeting with your hands and touching
###1384 your face repeatedly is usually a marker of anxiety
###1388 and not feeling comfortable.
###1390 Crossing your arms and leaning away
###1392 is a marker of I don't want to affiliate with you.
###1394 Put them together, what does it mean?
###1396 It means, I don't really want to be with you.
###1398 I don't like you.
###1399 And I'm nervous because I'm going
###1401 to screw you over in a minute.
###1402 And so none of these cues predict it on their own,
###1406 but together they did.
###1408 So the more often you saw a partner show this set of cues,
###1413 the smaller number of tokens you expected that person
###1415 to share with you, which meant the more selfish you thought
###1418 that person was going to be.
###1419 And the more often you yourself or any subject
###1422 emitted this four set of cues, the less trustworthy you
###1425 actually were, the more tokens you
###1428 kept and tried to get from the other person without sharing.
###1430 And so in some sense, what we're showing is ground truth here.
###1433 These cues are predicting actual financial cheating
###1436 versus cooperative behavior.
###1437 Now, the most interesting part about it
###1439 was if you asked our subjects, so what did you use?
###1443 They had no idea.
###1444 Or they would suggest it was other cues that
###1446 didn't predict anything.
###1447 Yeah, I showed you they were more accurate when
###1449 they saw the person.
###1450 And they adjusted their numbers and guesses accordingly.
###1454 So what this means is your mind is using these cues
###1457 even though you're not aware of what they are.
###1460 It's still building intuitions with them.
###1463 But how do you know those are the right cues?
###1465 People are doing lots of things.
###1466 How do I know that when I'm crossing my arms,
###1468 it's not that my left pupil is dilating
###1470 and that's the magic cue.
###1472 Well, being scientists, we needed to have precise control.
###1475 No matter what actor I had, I couldn't
###1477 get them to have exceedingly precise control
###1480 of every expression they're emitting.
###1482 So what do you do?
###1483 You need a robot.
###1485 So this robot, her name is Nexi.
###1488 She was designed and created by my collaborator Cynthia
###1490 Breazeal at MIT's Media Lab.
###1492 And so we simply used Nexi.
###1493 And I'll show you a video of it in a moment.
###1496 But the experiment was simple.
###1497 We repeated the same thing we did before,
###1500 except we replaced one of the people with the robot.
###1504 So now you're talking to this robot.
###1506 And the robot will emit the cues and express the cues
###1510 that we think signify untrustworthiness or not
###1514 in a very, very precisely controllable way.
###1516 The robot was controlled by two people, one
###1518 who was the voice of the robot, the other who would control
###1521 whether or not she made the cues.
###1523 Because you don't want the same person doing it,
###1525 because they might give cues in their vocal tone.
###1527 And because I know a lot of you are engineers,
###1529 I'll give you a quick idea of how this worked.
###1531 The one person here you can see who
###1533 is sitting in front of the computer,
###1535 there's a webcam on her face.
###1536 As she moves her head, it's gotten by the webcam.
###1540 The robot's head moves in real time.
###1541 She's wearing a mic here, so as she speaks,
###1543 it picks up the phonemes and the robot's mouth
###1545 moves in real time.
###1547 The next person controls whether the robot
###1548 gives these untrustworthy cues or other similar cues.
###1551 And the third person is our robot mischief person
###1555 who basically controls and monitors the system.
###1558 Because every once in awhile, it would go haywire
###1560 and the robot would like it's doing something crazy,
###1564 like it's possessed or something.
###1566 It would break down.
###1567 But normally it worked wonderfully and just fine.
###1570 And so we had participants, 65 participants
###1572 from the community.
###1573 We brought in 31 of them.
###1575 We showed that we had seen the cues
###1577 that Nexi meant untrustworthy.
###1580 The others didn't.
###1582 Here's a picture of it crossing its arms.
###1584 Here's a picture of it touching its face.
###1586 I'll show you a video in a second.
###1587 So the first part is people have to get used to the fact
###1589 that they're talking to a robot.
###1590 So we had this kind of part where they just
###1592 acclimated to it.
###1593 And here's what that looks like.
###1595 [VIDEO PLAYBACK]
###1595 NEXI: So my name's Nexi.
###1597 What's your name?
###1599 KIM: My name's Kim.
###1600 NEXI: Kim?
###1601 It's very nice to meet you.
###1602 KIM: You too.
###1604 NEXI: To get started today, why don't I
###1606 tell you a little bit about myself?
###1607 KIM: OK.
###1609 NEXI: I was born and built at the MIT Media
###1612 Lab two years ago.
###1614 So I guess in human years, I'm pretty young.
###1618 But in robot years, that's more like being 20.
###1622 KIM: (NERVOUS LAUGH).
###1623 DAVID DESTENO: So you can see she's a little uncomfortable.
###1626 In fact, we had to put that black barrier on the bottom
###1628 because people were afraid it was
###1630 going to go Terminator on them and kill them.
###1632 So we needed that little barrier.
###1634 But they quickly acclimated to this, as you'll see.
###1637 [VIDEO PLAYBACK]
###1637 KIM: That's basically all I do for fun though.
###1639 I don't have a lot of time.
###1641 NEXI: Did you grow up in Upstate New York?
###1645 KIM: Yeah, I did until I was 18, when I moved out here.
###1650 NEXI: It seems like that must have
###1651 been a big transition for you.
###1654 KIM: It was.
###1655 It was a really big transition.
###1658 But I kind of decided that it wasn't the life that I wanted.
###1663 DAVID DESTENO: So they would self disclose.
###1665 We heard about pets dying and all these things.
###1667 One person kept asking the robot if it believed in God.
###1671 That person was hard.
###1674 But for the most part, people behave.
###1675 And just so you can tell what it looks like face on,
###1677 I'll just show you a 10-second clip.
###1678 [VIDEO PLAYBACK]
###1679 NEXI: We all share a big, open room.
###1681 There are lots of cords and gadgets.
###1684 So it's probably not like your house.
###1688 But it's home for me.
###1691 Why don't you tell me about where you're from?
###1694 MAN: Well, I was born in Lawrence, Massachusetts,
###1697 and I had a residency in Somerville right now.
###1701 I've been doing residential the past four months.
###1704 DAVID DESTENO: And so we then had
###1706 them play this game with the robot.
###1708 We told them, look, the robot's got an artificial intelligence
###1710 algorithm that it's going to decide how much money it wants
###1713 to give you and how much money it thinks
###1715 you're going to give it based on how the interaction went.
###1718 It didn't, but that's what we told them.
###1720 And then we asked them questions about how much they
###1722 trusted the robot, et cetera.
###1723 So what happened?
###1725 So to make a long story short, what happened is these are,
###1730 for those of you who are mathematically inclined,
###1732 these are standardized regression coefficients.
###1735 When Nexi made the cues that signaled untrustworthiness
###1738 in the human to human interactions,
###1740 people reported trusting it less.
###1741 Now, the important thing is they didn't
###1743 report liking it less, because I was worried,
###1745 oh, they just might think it's doing something weird.
###1747 No, they liked it equally, but they trusted it less.
###1750 Now, that's important, because to me that makes it real.
###1752 Because we all have friends that we
###1754 like who we wouldn't trust with our money.
###1757 And so OK, and the less they trusted
###1759 it, the fewer tokens they predicted Nexi would give them,
###1763 basically meaning they thought Nexi was going
###1764 to be selfish and cheat them, and the smaller amount of money
###1768 in that game they actually gave it.
###1770 And so what this tells us is that we
###1773 know these are the cues because we manipulated them
###1775 with exact precision here while nothing else was happening
###1778 or things were happening that we could control.
###1780 And so cues to trustworthiness can
###1781 be imperfectly assessed, but better than chance.
###1785 And so the TSA starts to need to look
###1788 for cues in sets in a context-dependent way.
###1791 But in some ways, the more interesting part of this
###1793 is that what it suggests is that technology is now good enough
###1797 that the mind will now use these cues to ascribe
###1799 moral intent to robots, or to avatars, or to virtual agents.
###1805 So while you may not get it from R2-D2,
###1809 you will probably get it from Wall-E. See, I'll hear aww.
###1813 Wall-E is not human in the least,
###1817 but he has enough human characteristics in the eyes
###1820 and in the hands that he can move them
###1822 in a way that pings our mind's mental machinery
###1828 to make us feel trust, or warmth,
###1830 or compassion toward him.
###1831 So what does this mean?
###1832 It's a whole Pandora's box, because in some ways it's good.
###1835 So for people like Cynthia who want to design these robots
###1838 and she's working on the smaller ones
###1840 so that they can actually accompany kids
###1842 for medical treatment where parents can't go.
###1844 Think radiation treatments for kids with cancer.
###1846 They can go with the children.
###1849 They'll seem more trustworthy, more comforting.
###1853 But like any other science, it's not good or bad.
###1855 It depends on the uses of the people who want them.
###1858 We all know trust sells, so if I'm
###1859 a marketer, what does this mean?
###1861 It means that I have the perfect trustworthy or untrustworthy
###1864 person that I can show you.
###1865 Because in a human, stuff leaks.
###1867 No matter how much we're going to try and control it,
###1870 which is why we could pick up on untrustworthiness.
###1872 There is no leaking here.
###1874 We can control everything.
###1875 And so as we're conversing more and more with automated agents
###1878 and avatars, our trust is going to be manipulated in ways
###1882 that we could never have known before
###1885 or that our mind is not ready to defend against.
###1889 OK, finally, the last part of the talk,
###1892 how do we go about enhancing trustworthiness and enhancing
###1896 the compassion and resilience of each other?
###1900 To let you know just how powerful this can be
###1903 and how quickly trust can change and compassion can change,
###1906 let me give you of my favorite examples.
###1908 Some of you may know this story.
###1909 It's called the Christmas Eve truce of World War I.
###1914 So it was 1914, and the British were
###1915 fighting the Germans outside of Ypres, Belgium.
###1919 And it had been a long and a bloody battle.
###1921 And they were each in their trenches separated
###1923 by the no-man's land in between.
###1926 And on Christmas Eve, as the Brits
###1927 looked across the no-man's land, they
###1930 started to see lights appear.
###1932 And then they started to hear songs.
###1934 And at first, they didn't know what
###1935 they were because they were in German,
###1936 and they didn't speak German.
###1937 But then they soon recognized the melodies.
###1939 And what they were were Christmas carols.
###1942 And what happened next was amazing.
###1944 The men came out of their trenches,
###1946 and they started celebrating together.
###1948 They started exchanging trinkets.
###1950 They started talking about their families, showing pictures,
###1953 celebrating.
###1953 Now, these were men who hours ago
###1957 were trying to kill each other.
###1958 And no one would have ever trusted if I walked out,
###1961 was an open shot, I couldn't trust
###1963 that you weren't going to shoot me.
###1964 They always had shot each other before,
###1966 but here they were celebrating with each other
###1968 in a very communal way, by their own words, very amazing.
###1971 Here we were laughing and chatting
###1973 to men who only a few hours before we were trying to kill.
###1976 Now, if that's not a big change in how trustworthy somebody can
###1979 be, I don't know what is.
###1982 So the question is, how do we display such trust
###1984 and compassion in one moment and such cruelty the next?
###1988 Because if we can understand that,
###1989 then we can do something about it.
###1991 But to answer that question, what we have to realize first
###1994 is how do we address a different one?
###1996 How do we identify who is worthy to help?
###1999 The world is full of more people than we could possibly help.
###2002 Not that we don't want to help them,
###2003 but it could be overwhelming.
###2005 And there's this phenomenon that we know of in psychology called
###2008 compassion fatigue, which is when you're confronted
###2010 with people over and over and over again who need help,
###2013 you begin to dial it down.
###2015 I have this experience that I'm not
###2016 proud of when I go with my daughter to New York,
###2019 and we're walking by, and there was a homeless person.
###2021 She was like, daddy, help this person.
###2023 And then I realized that in that moment,
###2025 I'm completely ignoring this person,
###2027 because it's a common thing that I face all the time.
###2030 And if I stopped to try and help every person,
###2032 it would be overwhelming.
###2033 And so we have to understand how our mind goes
###2035 about deciding whose pain is worthy to feel,
###2038 who it's worth to help, and who it's worth
###2041 be trustworthy toward.
###2042 And once we understand that, then we can figure out,
###2045 OK, how do we increase the number of people
###2047 to whom we should feel that?
###2049 Well, one way that I think our mind does it is it
###2052 uses a simple metric.
###2053 And that metric is similarity.
###2056 So it comes back to this is Robert Trivers, who
###2060 was the discoverer of reciprocal altruism, which is basically
###2062 the idea, why do we help people in the biological sense?
###2065 It's I scratch your back today.
###2067 You'll scratch mine tomorrow.
###2068 In some ways, that's what similarity is.
###2070 When there's a lot of people who need my help, going back
###2074 to that equation of short-term versus long-term gain,
###2079 who should I help?
###2079 Who is it worth it for me to help?
###2080 What your mind does shaped by evolution is it
###2082 decides the person who is more similar to me is the person
###2086 that it's worth helping, because that's more likely
###2088 the person who's going to pay me back and be around later.
###2091 At least initially that's how it works.
###2093 And so what we wanted to do was to see
###2095 how deeply embedded this bias is.
###2098 If I said to you, if an American soldier's on the battlefield
###2101 and he comes across an American soldier and a member
###2103 of the Taliban and both of them are suffering the same wounds,
###2107 who is he or she going to feel more compassion for?
###2109 And if I said the American soldier,
###2110 you might not find that surprising.
###2112 But what I want to argue is that it's not
###2113 dependent on longstanding conflict.
###2115 It's this unconscious computation
###2117 that your mind makes.
###2118 And so we tried to strip that down to as basic a level
###2121 as we could.
###2122 And we did that by using something
###2123 called motor synchrony, which is people basically moving
###2126 together in time.
###2127 You see it in the military.
###2129 You see it in conga lines.
###2131 You see it lots of places.
###2133 You see it in lots of rituals.
###2135 And the idea is that if two people are moving together,
###2139 that's a marker that for here and now, their outcomes,
###2142 their purposes, their goals are joined.
###2145 And so we wanted to see if we could actually
###2147 show this effect at that level.
###2149 So we brought people into a lab, and they
###2150 thought it was a music perception study.
###2152 So they sat across from each other.
###2154 And there was sensors on the table,
###2155 and they had earphones on.
###2156 They didn't talk.
###2158 All they had to do was as you hear
###2160 the tones in your earphone, tap the sensor.
###2163 And so it was constructed so that the two people would
###2166 either be tapping in time or completely
###2168 randomly and out of time.
###2170 That was it.
###2172 Then what happens is they see the person
###2174 they were tapping with get cheated.
###2175 This party is staged, but they don't know it.
###2177 They believe it's real.
###2178 They see this person get cheated in a way that
###2180 makes that person have to do a lot of extra work
###2184 that they shouldn't have had to do.
###2186 And then what happens is we give them
###2188 a chance to decide if they want to go and help that person
###2191 and relieve that person's burden.
###2194 And that's what we look at.
###2197 So what happens?
###2198 We asked the people, how similar were you
###2201 to that person in the experiment?
###2203 The simple act of tapping your hands-- they didn't talk.
###2206 They didn't do anything-- made them
###2208 feel that they were more similar to the other person.
###2210 Now, if you ask them why, they'll create a story.
###2213 They'll say, oh, I think we were in the same class.
###2217 Or I think I've met this person somewhere
###2220 or we share the same goals.
###2222 They don't know.
###2223 They never talked to this person before.
###2225 None of that was true.
###2225 But because they had this intuition
###2227 that they felt more similar, they
###2228 had to create a story for it.
###2230 How much compassion did you feel for this person
###2233 when they got cheated and got stuck doing this onerous
###2235 work that they weren't supposed to do?
###2238 Remember, in both cases, the amount of suffering
###2240 is exactly the same.
###2242 Yet they feel more compassion for this person
###2245 if they were just tapping in time with them.
###2249 How many wanted to go help this person?
###2251 This I found truly amazing.
###2252 6 out of 34 people would say, oh,
###2255 I'll go help that person who was harmed
###2257 and cheated versus 17 of 35.
###2262 We had a threefold difference.
###2264 When you tapped your hands in time with this person,
###2266 50% of them said, I want to go help
###2268 this person who was wronged.
###2271 That's a huge effect if it's scalable.
###2273 How much time did they spend helping?
###2277 These are seconds.
###2278 So if you tapped your hands with this person,
###2281 you spent a lot more time knowing that everything you did
###2285 would relieve that person's burden.
###2287 And if you look at it-- again these
###2289 are regression coefficients-- if you tapped your hand in time
###2292 with this person, yes, you felt more similar to them.
###2295 And yes you like them more.
###2297 But what actually predicted the compassion you feel?
###2300 Not how much you like them but how similar you felt to them
###2304 If you tapped with them, you felt more similar.
###2306 That predicted how much compassion
###2308 you felt toward them even though the level of suffering
###2310 was the same objectively.
###2313 And the amount of compassion you felt for them directly
###2315 predicted how much time, how much effort you
###2318 put into relieving their pain.
###2320 Now, what this suggests is that compassion and trustworthiness
###2324 are flexible.
###2324 Because if you're going to be trustworthy to me,
###2326 that means you're going to sacrifice
###2327 your own immediate outcomes to benefit me like these people
###2332 did here.
###2333 Can I trust you to help me?
###2334 Can trust you not to shoot me back
###2338 with the Brits and the Germans.
###2339 
###2342 Where I live, what this means is trying
###2345 to solve some of the more contentious things
###2348 we have in Boston, which is Yankees versus Red Sox.
###2350 But what that means basically is not
###2351 thinking about your new neighbor as the guy
###2353 who hates the dreaded Yankees.
###2355 Think about him as the guy who likes Starbucks
###2357 as much as you do.
###2359 If you can actually retrain your mind to find similarities
###2363 that you have with people, it will
###2364 increase your trustworthiness toward them and the compassion
###2368 that you feel toward them.
###2371 When you think about social media,
###2374 there are tremendous ways to do this.
###2376 We can use the computational power of social media
###2379 in ways to connect people that have never
###2380 been connected before.
###2381 Think about things like profiles on Facebook or other things.
###2386 We have vast knowledge of what people like and don't like,
###2390 what they've done or haven't done.
###2394 Perhaps what you can do is find what people in conflict
###2396 have in common very rapidly in the background
###2401 and surface that information to them.
###2403 And if you do, then it should function
###2405 in just the same way as tapping your hands.
###2406 There's nothing magic about tapping your hands.
###2408 We've done it with wearing the same wristband colors,
###2410 et cetera.
###2411 Anything that you can do to highlight similarity
###2413 with someone will make your goals
###2415 seems more joined, which will increase the compassion you
###2418 feel to them if they're suffering,
###2419 which will increase how trustworthy you
###2421 are toward them even in ways that don't involve compassion.
###2426 So at Google, I'm really interested and open
###2429 to talking with any of you about if you
###2430 have ideas about using the computational power
###2432 that you all have to kind of nudge trustworthiness
###2436 and compassion in the world.
###2439 But that's all kind of a top-down way.
###2441 This is a way that we have to remind ourselves,
###2443 OK, think about this person as similar to me or not.
###2446 It will be nice if we had a way that could make it automatic,
###2449 a way that works from the bottom up so that we don't
###2451 have to stop and remind ourselves.
###2454 And one way that we can do this--
###2455 and I know it's an idea close to Ming's heart,
###2458 and I'm really honored to be here
###2460 to be able to talk with him about it-- is mindfulness.
###2465 If you read the paper or know anything
###2467 about mindfulness, what you'll know
###2469 is that it is enjoying a renaissance.
###2472 And we know it does all kinds of wonderful things.
###2475 And probably many of you have more experience
###2477 with it here thanks to Ming's course.
###2481 It will increase your creativity.
###2483 It will increase your productivity.
###2485 It's good for your health.
###2486 It'll lower your blood pressure.
###2488 It'll even increase your scores on standardized tests.
###2491 These are all good things.
###2493 But if you think about it, it's not
###2494 what it was originally designed for.
###2497 If you look at what Buddha said or many
###2499 of the other ancient meditation teachers-- well
###2500 this is a quote by Buddha.
###2501 I teach one thing and one only.
###2504 That is suffering and the end of suffering.
###2507 There weren't LSATs and GMATs back then.
###2510 So all these other things that meditation does are wonderful,
###2514 and they're great.
###2515 But one of the main purposes was to foster compassion and end
###2518 suffering and to increase our being good to each other
###2521 and being trustworthy to each other.
###2522 And so what we decided to do was actually
###2524 put that idea to a test.
###2526 And so we brought people into the lab.
###2528 These were people who had never meditated before.
###2530 They were members of the Boston community.
###2532 And they were all equally interested in meditation,
###2536 doing a class for eight weeks.
###2537 We assigned half of them to actually take
###2539 a mindfulness class led by a Buddhist lama.
###2543 And they also would go home during the week
###2546 with MP3s created by the lama that they would practice.
###2549 The other half were put on a wait list.
###2551 So this way we had groups that were equally interested
###2553 in medication, because you might imagine that if we just
###2555 recruited people who wanted to meditate,
###2557 they might have been different types of people
###2559 in the first place.
###2559 So both groups were equally interested, but only half
###2562 of them actually got the course.
###2563 The other half got it after we did the measure.
###2566 After eight weeks, we brought them back to the lab.
###2568 Now, they thought they were coming
###2569 to have their memory, and their executive control,
###2571 and all these cognitive measures tested, which we did.
###2574 But before we did those, what we really were interested in
###2576 is what was going to happen in the waiting room.
###2578 And so in our waiting room, we had three chairs.
###2582 Two were filled by actors and the third was for the subject.
###2585 And so when the subject arrived, what did the subject do?
###2587 Well, all them except one sat down.
###2589 We couldn't get that other guy to sit down no matter what.
###2591 But most of them sat down.
###2593 And then a third actor would enter the room.
###2597 This person was on crutches, had one of those foot
###2600 boots you wear when your ankle is broken.
###2601 And as she'd walk down the hall entering the room,
###2603 she would kind of wince in pain and looked
###2605 noticeably uncomfortable.
###2607 And she'd enter the room, and there weren't any chairs.
###2610 And so she'd lean against the wall.
###2611 And the question was, what would the person do?
###2613 The actors were told to busy themselves in their iPhone
###2616 and to not pay attention.
###2617 Now, in psychology we call this a bystander effect
###2620 where this really limits helping.
###2621 If you're in a situation where you
###2623 see somebody in pain and other people aren't helping,
###2625 that tends to decrease anybody's odds of helping,
###2628 because you say, oh, it's not a big deal
###2629 or maybe I shouldn't help.
###2630 And so this situation is one that
###2632 makes being counted on that you're trustworthy to come
###2635 and help the lowest it possibly can.
###2639 So what happens?
###2640 
###2642 So people who were in the control group, only very
###2649 small percentage of them helped, like 16%.
###2654 Among those who meditated, 50% of them helped.
###2657 That's a threefold increase.
###2659 And that's a threefold increase in the situation that
###2661 is designed to actually work the most
###2665 against your willing to help.
###2668 Now, if that can happen after eight weeks
###2670 and if that is scalable, that is a huge, huge effect
###2675 that you can count on other people.
###2677 You can trust them that they're going to help you.
###2680 Now, why does it work that way?
###2684 It works that way because one part of mindfulness
###2687 is this idea of equanimity.
###2690 And that means realizing that I am similar to you,
###2692 and you are similar to me.
###2693 Friends are enemies, are enemies can become friends.
###2696 And what that does is it trains the mind
###2698 to see us all as valuable and interlinked.
###2700 And it breaks down the categories
###2702 that we put on each other of we're different in religion.
###2704 We're different in sports teams you like, et cetera.
###2707 And I think that's why it works.
###2708 And then it becomes automatic.
###2709 It does the same thing that my little tapping example
###2711 was doing.
###2713 And so when it comes down to it, really what I want to say
###2716 is that in the end, it's trust or it's dust.
###2719 And what I mean by that is without trust,
###2722 our ability to be resilient as a society is exceedingly low.
###2727 And so how can we build it up?
###2730 Anything we can do to nudge it up
###2732 is important to being resilient.
###2736 In the fall of 2012, I don't know how many of you remember
###2738 out here, but on the East Coast, super storm Sandy hit New York.
###2742 And it was a devastating storm.
###2745 And there are neighborhoods that still aren't recovered.
###2748 But the AP did a great study.
###2751 Controlling for the amount of damage that occurred,
###2753 they looked at what was the single most important predictor
###2757 of a neighborhood's resilience.
###2760 The single most important predictor
###2762 was how much neighbors trusted each other.
###2765 How much they know that the other person
###2767 they could count on them, that that person was
###2768 going to have compassion for them,
###2770 that they were going to work together.
###2772 The neighborhoods that were higher in trust
###2774 were the neighborhoods that got up and running
###2776 in terms of commerce, and support,
###2778 and social services faster than anything.
###2780 And that's why I say in the end, it really is trust or dust.
###2782 If we don't trust, we're harming everybody.
###2784 But of course there were people in neighborhoods who price
###2787 gouged and who did things they shouldn't.
###2789 And so really my message in the book is, yes, trusting is good.
###2794 We should all trust.
###2795 But trusting wisely is better.
###2798 And so it's my hope that any of you who read this or come
###2801 into contact with this work, it will empower you to think
###2805 about the way trust actually works
###2808 and the forces that impinge on it
###2809 to make better decisions about who you can trust
###2811 but also how to foster trustworthiness in yourself.
###2816 And I thank you so much for listening to me.
###2818 
###2823 MING: Thank you, my friend.
###2824 We have time for questions.
###2826 Anybody have any questions?
###2827 AUDIENCE: Two fairly related questions,
###2830 in the earlier test about looking for cues,
###2833 so I'm just wondering how you came
###2836 to the domain of different things
###2838 you were looking for that could conceivably
###2840 be a cue in your analysis.
###2843 Because you could say whether the pinkie is touching
###2845 the hand and the hand's touching is or not.
###2848 And then along with that, with whether you
###2851 were going into it starting off focused on physical cues
###2855 or if you were also considering the types of issues
###2859 that were brought up in conversation, which could then
###2863 play into the talking with a robot
###2866 or talking over the internet.
###2869 DAVID DESTENO: So let me do the second one first.
###2871 We were primarily interested in physical cues.
###2874 There's lots of work out there as well
###2875 on linguistics and the type of phrasing
###2878 that people use as well as vocal tone.
###2881 We weren't looking for those.
###2882 It doesn't mean that those don't matter.
###2884 And so I'm not saying these are the only cues that matter,
###2886 but these are sufficient to predict.
###2887 The more that we know about, our accuracy will go.
###2891 But we were interested in the actual physical, biological
###2894 motion cues.
###2895 How did we get them?
###2896 We simply started with the brute force method,
###2899 was looking for individual cues that
###2901 had some predictive ability at all.
###2903 Because even if they're not predictive greatly
###2906 on their own, they have to have some predictive power
###2908 on their own.
###2909 And then we would begin to do is to assemble
###2911 different subsets just trying to maximize the amount of accuracy
###2914 that we can predict.
###2915 So it was a very bottom-up approach.
###2917 And then once we have those four sets,
###2918 those predicted the greatest amount of variance
###2921 in people's selfish monetary behavior.
###2924 Which is then why, again, it was really
###2925 important to use the robot.
###2926 Because you're right.
###2927 This was a correlational method.
###2928 Who knows what we could be picking up.
###2929 Maybe on every time I cross my arm, it was my pinkie.
###2932 And so we could actually manipulate it with precision
###2934 with the robot to validate it.
###2935 MING: If you could put a pinkie down here,
###2937 it's not trustworthy.
###2938 
###2942 That's what I learned from a movie.
###2943 AUDIENCE: Let's see if I can word this the right way.
###2945 It seems like the general conclusion
###2947 from the research or your conclusion
###2949 is you're saying we should be more trusting of others,
###2953 like sort of the hope for the better world.
###2955 And the question is, is there also then some drive for people
###2959 themselves to be trustworthy?
###2961 Like in the example you gave in the beginning
###2963 about people in a marriage, one cheated on the other,
###2967 is it to say, put that aside.
###2969 Trust that person.
###2970 Or is there some other conclusion in that sense?
###2972 DAVID DESTENO: It's a good question.
###2974 What we know from all the-- so people
###2975 like Martin Nowak at Harvard is a straight mathematician,
###2978 evolutionary biologist.
###2979 And so they run these fantastic models.
###2981 And what we know is that if you are
###2982 untrustworthy in the short run, you will profit immensely.
###2986 But over time, that profit then starts to go down.
###2988 And so in the long run, people who are trustworthy
###2990 profit the most in terms of everything and even as a group.
###2994 And so we know that's the better outcome.
###2996 But if you can be untrustworthy and not get caught,
###3000 you're going to profit.
###3001 So how do we try to balance those?
###3003 And so what we're trying to do is
###3004 to make everybody want to be more
###3005 trustworthy but at the same time also make better decisions.
###3008 It will be impossible to have a world where
###3010 everybody is trustworthy.
###3012 Because if everybody's trustworthy,
###3013 you stop even looking and caring.
###3015 You just automatically say, yes, I'll trust you.
###3017 And then if there's a mutation or whatever that causes people
###3019 to be more untrustworthy, they're
###3022 going to profit like crazy.
###3024 Until then everybody starts caring,
###3025 and so it's always going to be in an equilibrium.
###3027 The question is, can we increase the set point
###3029 for trustworthiness to a higher level?
###3032 And so it's about increasing your own trustworthiness
###3034 but about deciding if you can trust somebody else wisely.
###3037 So yes, if you know absolutely nothing,
###3039 it's better to trust than not trust in the long run
###3042 in terms of quantifying the benefits that can happen.
###3045 But it's certainly not as good as making
###3047 an informed correct decision.
###3048 And so my hope is to try and open people's eyes
###3051 to how trust really works so that you
###3052 can make better decisions.
###3054 AUDIENCE: So similar to that question, trust over time,
###3058 have you done any research into how analysis of trust
###3063 has to change, how much it needs to be
###3064 dependent on data changing?
###3067 Like the first study was on the initial get to know you,
###3071 how much I trust you as a person.
###3073 And then the question is later on, something happens.
###3078 How much should future events be added into that evaluation?
###3081 DAVID DESTENO: You mean at what point will I
###3084 change my judgment of whether I can trust you?
###3087 It's dependent on a lot of things.
###3088 It's often dependent on the magnitude of what you have held
###3092 up your end for what you haven't.
###3095 But I guess my argument is that you
###3097 need to look at each situation if it's important and new.
###3101 Because even somebody who has been always trustworthy,
###3104 if the costs and benefits change--
###3105 the reason they're always trustworthy is the cost
###3107 and benefits are rather stable.
###3109 Take that person and change the cost and benefits
###3111 either by dangling a reward that is immense in front of them
###3115 or giving them anonymity so they won't get caught,
###3117 like our people, and they'll change.
###3118 So I think there's not a clear time frame.
###3122 I think we all adjust at different rates
###3124 depending upon the magnitude.
###3126 But my message is no matter what you think, consider
###3129 the situation.
###3130 If it's somebody you always trusted,
###3131 consider has their power changed?
###3133 Has anything else changed?
###3135 Because they may not want to be untrustworthy just
###3137 like our subjects did, but they will
###3138 be and construct a story for why.
###3140 AUDIENCE: Hi and thank you for coming.
###3142 I have a question actually kind of related to that.
###3144 So have you done any study in how people's relationship
###3148 long term potentially changes how sensitive or not sensitive
###3152 they are to social cues?
###3153 I can imagine someone who perhaps
###3155 does all of the social cues that you mentioned
###3157 in terms of lying, but perhaps like a brother and sister,
###3160 for example.
###3160 They've gotten numb to it over time,
###3161 and maybe they can't pick up on it anymore.
###3163 Or do you have a sort of sense of how long-term relationships
###3167 can change how people pick up on that?
###3169 DAVID DESTENO: Two things on that,
###3170 we haven't done that work, but what
###3171 we know from the nonverbal literature in general
###3174 is that people have a what are often termed accents.
###3178 So there's a kind of panhuman way of doing it.
###3181 But then different cultures or even different families
###3183 or individuals will have modifications of that.
###3186 And so the longer you are with someone,
###3188 you can learn that for this person,
###3190 this is that person's tell in some ways.
###3193 And it will be some combination of these.
###3195 But other things added to that will increase your accuracy
###3197 for that person.
###3198 But another thing in terms of long term, what does trust
###3201 do, it's beneficial.
###3202 So there's great work done by Sandra Murray.
###3204 She's psychologist who studies romantic relationships.
###3206 And one thing that the trust does in our relationships
###3208 is it smooths out the bumps, as I said.
###3212 So we've probably all had times when our significant other
###3214 does something and it makes us go hmm,
###3217 whether it's you think the person's flirting with someone
###3220 or they're working late or what is it.
###3221 Well, if you inherently trust this person,
###3224 at a very nonconscious level, that trust erases that hmm.
###3229 It just gives you an intuition that everything's fine.
###3232 And if you trust that intuition, that's good.
###3234 Because lots of times we'll do something
###3236 that we're not trying to be untrustworthy.
###3238 It's just an inadvertent thing.
###3239 But if a person interprets that as, oh, you're untrustworthy,
###3242 it can start you into kind of a death spiral.
###3244 And so the good thing about trusting someone
###3246 over the long time in a relationship
###3248 is that it helps smooth out those bumps
###3249 so there aren't mistakes made.
###3251 So that one person doesn't interpret the other person
###3253 as flirting or doing something with somebody else
###3254 that they shouldn't have.
###3256 Now, if they keep doing it, well, then you're
###3257 going to know it's real.
###3258 But that's a benefit of trust long term.
###3261 MING: Thank you, my friend.
###3263 So the book is "The Truth About Trust"
###3265 available where books are sold, also
###3266 available at the back of this room.
###3268 And David will be around to sign books.
###3269 And my friends, David DeSteno.
###3271 DAVID DESTENO: Thank you all.
###3273
