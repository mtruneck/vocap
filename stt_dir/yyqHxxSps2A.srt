CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: We`re celebrating a
birthday today on CNN STUDENT NEWS, and we


2
0:0:4,529 --> 0:0:9,61
are sharing some of your thoughts on police
officers using pushups as punishment. I`m


3
0:0:9,61 --> 0:0:25,57
Carl Azuz. It all starts right now.


4
0:0:25,57 --> 0:0:30,14
Football games often start with a coin toss
and a national anthem. Sunday`s pregame ceremonies


5
0:0:30,14 --> 0:0:35,47
in Kansas City also included a moment of silence.
The Kansas City Chiefs held the moment for


6
0:0:35,47 --> 0:0:39,36
the victims of domestic violence and their
families. It`s an issue with an immediate


7
0:0:39,36 --> 0:0:44,83
connection to the Kansas City community and
the Chiefs team. Jovan Belcher was a linebacker


8
0:0:44,83 --> 0:0:49,96
for Kansas City. Police reports say that on
Saturday, Belcher shot and killed his girlfriend,


9
0:0:49,96 --> 0:0:54,42
Cassandra Perkins. He drove to the team`s
practice facility where he then took his own


10
0:0:54,42 --> 0:0:58,87
life. When violence like this occurs, you
might expect the issue of gun control to come


11
0:0:58,87 --> 0:1:2,58
up, you might not expect it to come up during
a half-time show.


12
0:1:2,58 --> 0:1:4,759
And that`s what happened on Sunday night.


13
0:1:4,759 --> 0:1:9,92
NBC`s Bob Costas talked about it during the
Sunday night football broadcast. He quoted


14
0:1:9,92 --> 0:1:15,7
another sports reporter, Jason Whitlock, whom
Costas agreed with. Here is what he said,


15
0:1:15,7 --> 0:1:19,92
quote: "Our current gun culture ensures that
more and more domestic disputes will end in


16
0:1:19,92 --> 0:1:25,759
the ultimate tragedy. Handguns do not enhance
our safety. They tempt us to escalate arguments


17
0:1:25,759 --> 0:1:29,549
and bait us into embracing confrontation rather
than avoiding it."


18
0:1:29,549 --> 0:1:34,74
Now, there was an immediate reaction to this
online. It was not necessarily about gun control,


19
0:1:34,74 --> 0:1:39,99
it was about Costas discussing the issue during
a sports program. One sports talk show host


20
0:1:39,99 --> 0:1:45,3
said, quote, "I will gladly debate Jason Whitlock
and Bob Costas on gun control, but we tuned


21
0:1:45,3 --> 0:1:49,49
in for an NFL game! Ridiculous programming
decision!"


22
0:1:49,49 --> 0:1:53,319
Another person on Twitter said, quote, "Big
ups to Bob Costas for standing up for gun


23
0:1:53,319 --> 0:1:57,429
control. Hopefully, some day we can actually
have a conversation about it as a nation."


24
0:1:57,429 --> 0:2:2,149
So, on our blog today we are tossing it to
you to get your take. We are focusing on what


25
0:2:2,149 --> 0:2:6,799
Bob Costas did. Should he have weighed in
on the issue of gun control during halftime,


26
0:2:6,799 --> 0:2:11,26
or was this an issue of a bad decision or
bad timing? We are looking for your thoughts


27
0:2:11,26 --> 0:2:12,95
at cnnstudentnews.com


28
0:2:12,95 --> 0:2:18,4
U.S. government is getting closer to the edge
of the fiscal cliff. Congress and the president


29
0:2:18,4 --> 0:2:23,189
have until January 1 to agree on the plan
to lower the country`s debt. That could include


30
0:2:23,189 --> 0:2:27,65
how the government takes in money through
taxes and how it spends money. If they don`t


31
0:2:27,65 --> 0:2:31,819
come up with the deal, we know that taxes
will go up for all Americans, and government


32
0:2:31,819 --> 0:2:36,5
spending will also get cut. Ted Rowlands looks
at what that might mean for one city.


33
0:2:36,5 --> 0:2:37,319
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


34
0:2:37,319 --> 0:2:41,59
TED ROWLANDS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: First and
foremost, there`s the Rock Island Arsenal.


35
0:2:41,59 --> 0:2:47,159
If Congress doesn`t act, defense spending
will be slashed by 55 billion next year and


36
0:2:47,159 --> 0:2:52,959
450 billion over ten years. Which many fear
could put the Arsenal in jeopardy. The Arsenal


37
0:2:52,959 --> 0:2:57,939
is the area`s largest employer. And though
it`s not clear how any cuts would impact the


38
0:2:57,939 --> 0:3:3,49
installation specifically, the mere prospect
has people worried.


39
0:3:3,49 --> 0:3:9,4
Next, is healthcare, another major employer
in the quad cities. If Congress doesn`t act,


40
0:3:9,4 --> 0:3:14,239
Medicare reimbursement will initially drop
by two percent. Trinity Medical Center in


41
0:3:14,239 --> 0:3:17,769
Rock Island is already budgeting for the fiscal
cliff.


42
0:3:17,769 --> 0:3:22,26
Other possible fiscal cliff cuts that could
hit Rock Island include the Army Corps of


43
0:3:22,26 --> 0:3:26,269
Engineers. They are here in part to manage
the locks along the Mississippi.


44
0:3:26,269 --> 0:3:30,609
There is cuts to public education, which the
National School Board Association said could


45
0:3:30,609 --> 0:3:33,65
have a profound effect if Congress doesn`t
act.


46
0:3:33,65 --> 0:3:39,599
And there are potential cuts to social services.
More than 12 percent of Rock Island`s population


47
0:3:39,599 --> 0:3:45,98
lives below the poverty line. And of course,
there are the tax hikes.


48
0:3:45,98 --> 0:3:51,549
At Theo`s coffee shop, people have a lot to
say about Washington D.C. and the fiscal cliff.


49
0:3:51,549 --> 0:3:56,76
James Cheeks says he`s counting on Congress
to prevent his taxes from going up.


50
0:3:56,76 --> 0:4:1,65
JAMES CHEEKS, CUSTOMER: Scary. You know, it`s
scary. Where then money is going to come from?


51
0:4:1,65 --> 0:4:4,799
You know, how am I going to pay this extra
tax hike?


52
0:4:4,799 --> 0:4:8,709
ROWLANDS: The potential effects of the fiscal
cliff aren`t necessarily any more or less


53
0:4:8,709 --> 0:4:13,56
significant here in Rock Island than they
would be in any other city across the country.


54
0:4:13,56 --> 0:4:18,609
The bottom line is, if Congress doesn`t act,
there will be significant repercussions for


55
0:4:18,609 --> 0:4:22,389
the entire country. Ted Rowlands, CNN, Rock
Island, Illinois.

UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Today`s "Shoutout" goes
out to Mr. Lind`s social studies classes at


59
0:4:27,819 --> 0:4:30,6
Highland High School in Ault, Colorado.


60
0:4:30,6 --> 0:4:35,63
Which of these technologies is celebrating
its 20th birthday this week? Here we go, is


61
0:4:35,63 --> 0:4:39,53
it the cell phone, artificial heart, DVD or
text message?


62
0:4:39,53 --> 0:4:45,65
You`ve got three seconds, go!


63
0:4:45,65 --> 0:4:53,36
If you guessed the text message, you are right.
The first one was sent 20 years ago this week.


64
0:4:53,36 --> 0:4:55,889
That`s your answer and that`s your "Shoutout."


65
0:4:55,889 --> 0:4:58,199
(END VIDEO CLIP)


66
0:4:58,199 --> 0:5:3,69
AZUZ: The text of the first text message -- "Merry
Christmas." The engineer was sending it to


67
0:5:3,69 --> 0:5:10,75
his boss who was at a Christmas party. What
started as two words has exploded in the 2.2


68
0:5:10,75 --> 0:5:15,449
trillion texts. That`s how many are sent every
year just in the U.S., so it works out to


69
0:5:15,449 --> 0:5:18,9
about 6 billion per day.


70
0:5:18,9 --> 0:5:22,289
Text messaging is slowing down a little bit.
So, some analysts start wondering if it`ll


71
0:5:22,289 --> 0:5:27,38
BRB. But for a lot of people, especially you
guys, it`s the most common form of communication.


72
0:5:27,38 --> 0:5:32,69
So, the idea of texting disappearing any time
soon might just make you LOL.


73
0:5:32,69 --> 0:5:38,77
Well, the CNN Heroes program is all about
honoring people who are making a difference.


74
0:5:38,77 --> 0:5:44,169
People like Malala Yousafzai. She`s the Pakistani
teenager who was shot by the Taliban because


75
0:5:44,169 --> 0:5:49,539
of her support for girls` right to education
in her home country. Malala is recovering


76
0:5:49,539 --> 0:5:51,8
from the attack and she has a message for
her supporters.

78
0:5:52,71 --> 0:5:57,56
ANDERSON COOPER, CNN ANCHOR: "Thank you so
much for the outpouring of love and support.


79
0:5:57,56 --> 0:6:2,55
I thank the people who supported me without
distinguishing religion and color. People


80
0:6:2,55 --> 0:6:8,3
have actually supported a cause, not an individual.
Let`s work together, she says. Let`s work


81
0:6:8,3 --> 0:6:10,3
together to educate girls around the world.

KAREEN WYNTER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The red
carpet outside L.A.`s Shrine Auditorium buzzed


88
0:6:28,36 --> 0:6:34,49
with excitement, but this time the bright
lights shined on some special stars, everyday


89
0:6:34,49 --> 0:6:35,83
people changing the world.


90
0:6:35,83 --> 0:6:38,47
COOPER: Welcome to CNN Heroes, an All-Star
Tribute


91
0:6:38,47 --> 0:6:43,599
WYNTER: Out of thousands of nominations submitted
by CNN`s global audience, ten amazing men


92
0:6:43,599 --> 0:6:48,789
and women were singled out for their remarkable
heroic efforts to make the world a better


93
0:6:48,789 --> 0:6:55,36
place. People like Razia Jan, who is providing
a free education to hundreds of girls in rural


94
0:6:55,36 --> 0:6:55,629
Afghanistan.


95
0:6:55,629 --> 0:7:0,419
RAZIA JAN, "HEROES" HONOREE: I think education
is the only thing in the world that can go


96
0:7:0,419 --> 0:7:2,56
forward and make life better.


97
0:7:2,56 --> 0:7:7,93
WYNTER: And Leo McCarthy, who gives scholarships
to kids who pledge not to drink after his


98
0:7:7,93 --> 0:7:9,96
daughter was killed by a young driver.


99
0:7:9,96 --> 0:7:15,9
LEO MCCARTHY: Let`s change a culture and keep
these promising, vibrant kids alive.


100
0:7:15,9 --> 0:7:21,77
WYNTER: Olympic swimmer Kolin Jones helped
celebrate Wanda Butts golden moment. Motivated


101
0:7:21,77 --> 0:7:27,18
by her son`s tragic drowning, she created
a non- profit that helped more than 1200 children


102
0:7:27,18 --> 0:7:28,289
learn how to swim.


103
0:7:28,289 --> 0:7:33,539
WANDA BUTTS, "HEROES" HONOREE: It is unbelievable
to me that I have come this far from such


104
0:7:33,539 --> 0:7:34,849
a tragedy with my son.


105
0:7:34,849 --> 0:7:40,729
WYNTER: It was an unforgettable night capped
off with the unveiling of the CNN Hero of


106
0:7:40,729 --> 0:7:47,28
the Year: Pushpa Basnet, founder of a Children`s
Home in Nepal that helps kids whose parents


107
0:7:47,28 --> 0:7:47,61
are in prison.


108
0:7:47,61 --> 0:7:50,8
PUSHPA BASNET, CNN HERO OF THE YEAR: And thank
you so much for everyone who brought it for


109
0:7:50,8 --> 0:7:51,659
me and who believed in my dream.


110
0:7:51,659 --> 0:8:2,61
WYNTER: The hope is that their heroic example
will inspire countless others.


111

Kareen Wynter, CNN, Los Angeles.


112
0:8:4,97 --> 0:8:6,99
(END VIDEOTAPE)


113
0:8:6,99 --> 0:8:10,46
AZUZ: Last week, we told you about some Rhode
Island police officers who made a group of


114
0:8:10,46 --> 0:8:15,74
young people do pushups instead of arresting
or reporting them for allegedly vandalizing


115
0:8:15,74 --> 0:8:16,689
a mailbox.


116
0:8:16,689 --> 0:8:21,409
On our blog, 75 percent of you sided with
the police, saying, you supported the push-up


117
0:8:21,409 --> 0:8:25,849
punishment. Hannah wrote: "Although more could`ve
been done to ensure the alleged vandalism


118
0:8:25,849 --> 0:8:30,479
wouldn`t happen again, it was a perfectly
good punishment. Anybody would rather do push-ups


119
0:8:30,479 --> 0:8:31,28
than pay a fine.


120
0:8:31,28 --> 0:8:35,789
From Robbie, "The punishment would only be
OK it if was a small, harmless crime, but


121
0:8:35,789 --> 0:8:38,909
it was a larger crime, it shouldn`t be an
option."


122
0:8:38,909 --> 0:8:43,38
Christine says, "As much as a punishment was
needed, it wasn`t up to the police officers


123
0:8:43,38 --> 0:8:46,7
themselves to decide what it would be."


124
0:8:46,7 --> 0:8:50,47
Mr. Mike`s juvenile detention class says "The
police officers let the suspects off with


125
0:8:50,47 --> 0:8:54,16
a good warning as opposed to arresting them
on the spot!"


126
0:8:54,16 --> 0:8:57,63
And Hong wrote, "I`m not surprised by this
punishment, because it`s quite popular in


127
0:8:57,63 --> 0:9:1,79
my home country. This type of punishment does
not cause any harm."


128
0:9:1,79 --> 0:9:7,57
Today`s before we go segment is a tale where
cuisine meets convenience.


129
0:9:7,57 --> 0:9:11,88
This vending machine in a California mall
seems a little fishy. It`s because it`s filled


130
0:9:11,88 --> 0:9:18,19
with caviar, fish eggs. Now you can snack
while you shop in style. The prices run anywhere


131
0:9:18,19 --> 0:9:26,39
from 12 bucks to 500. Add it all up, and this
machine`s filled with $50,000 in merchandise.


132
0:9:26,39 --> 0:9:30,75
Some critics say caviar doesn`t belong in
the food court, but if shoppers are willing


133
0:9:30,75 --> 0:9:36,26
to pay, it seems like an eggselent idea. If
you do have any official complaints, you could


134
0:9:36,26 --> 0:9:39,35
take it up with the sturgeon general. But
you might have to vent for yourself because


135
0:9:39,35 --> 0:9:41,29
you could just be fighting an upstream battle.


136
0:9:41,29 --> 0:9:45,49
We just hope you won`t start a row, because
that would be in bad taste. We hope you have


137
0:9:45,49 --> 0:11:45,49
a great rest of the day. CNN STUDENT NEWS.
