[MUSIC]


3
0:0:14,19 --> 0:0:18,41
The 435i is lower, stiffer, and
generally sportier than


4
0:0:18,41 --> 0:0:19,45
the 3 Series.


5
0:0:19,45 --> 0:0:22,96
But the biggest news is probably
the name, which to me


6
0:0:22,96 --> 0:0:24,87
is plain wrong.


7
0:0:24,87 --> 0:0:29,5
It's like renaming Coca Cola,
Vegetable Bum Water.


8
0:0:29,5 --> 0:0:30,792
Actually, it's not quite
that bad, as you know.


9
0:0:30,792 --> 0:0:32,32
But you get the gist.


10
0:0:32,32 --> 0:0:35,8
The 3 Series coupe was
a motoring staple.


11
0:0:35,8 --> 0:0:38,256
It didn't need renaming.


12
0:0:38,256 --> 0:0:41,0
After several aborted attempts
to record a [INAUDIBLE]


13
0:0:41,0 --> 0:0:43,29
camera on the roads around
Lisbon, I'm resorting to


14
0:0:43,29 --> 0:0:43,78
voice-over.


15
0:0:43,78 --> 0:0:45,72
It just wasn't happening.


16
0:0:45,72 --> 0:0:47,246
It's a man thing.


17
0:0:47,246 --> 0:0:48,6
--434--


18
0:0:48,6 --> 0:0:50,76
Please turn left
in 100 metres.


19
0:0:50,76 --> 0:0:52,54
I need to be rid of you.


20
0:0:52,54 --> 0:0:55,43
This is a curious car, because
at first it seems ridiculous


21
0:0:55,43 --> 0:0:59,93
that a 306-horsepower BMW coupe
that will smash up to 62


22
0:0:59,93 --> 0:1:3,48
miles an hour in 5.1 seconds,
could come across as a bit


23
0:1:3,48 --> 0:1:5,66
uninteresting.


24
0:1:5,66 --> 0:1:8,6
This one is at least fitted with
the optional 8-speed auto


25
0:1:8,6 --> 0:1:12,46
which is, as I have to keep
saying, is plain brilliant.


26
0:1:12,46 --> 0:1:15,2
Optional electric dampers ride
well in comfort, a little bit


27
0:1:15,2 --> 0:1:16,76
spiky in spots.


28
0:1:16,76 --> 0:1:20,32
The 435i is so fast and
discreet, you wonder if BMW


29
0:1:20,32 --> 0:1:22,81
could have made it any more
ordinary looking--


30
0:1:22,81 --> 0:1:25,7
except for those weird arrow
bits on the front wings, which


31
0:1:25,7 --> 0:1:28,13
look like seals' ears.


32
0:1:28,13 --> 0:1:29,78
The problem here is
a familiar one--


33
0:1:29,78 --> 0:1:32,97
the 435i is so accomplished,
you wonder if it borders on


34
0:1:32,97 --> 0:1:34,19
the boring.


35
0:1:34,19 --> 0:1:36,59
So I wandered into the faded
glory of Estoril.


36
0:1:36,59 --> 0:1:38,8
And couldn't really hide my
disappointment at the


37
0:1:38,8 --> 0:1:41,37
normalness of it all.


38
0:1:41,37 --> 0:1:42,57
I know the M4--


39
0:1:42,57 --> 0:1:44,87
now that sounds completely
wrong to my ears--


40
0:1:44,87 --> 0:1:48,47
will be the hot shoe, but a
300-horsepower, rear-drive BMW


41
0:1:48,47 --> 0:1:50,41
should make you tingle
just a bit.


42
0:1:50,41 --> 0:1:51,9
Shouldn't it?


43
0:1:51,9 --> 0:1:55,22
The steering is quick, the car
changes direction beautifully,


44
0:1:55,22 --> 0:1:58,39
the motor does that
BMW growly thing.


45
0:1:58,39 --> 0:2:0,87
But it's just not
that enlivening.


46
0:2:0,87 --> 0:2:3,9
Nor was the message from BMW.


47
0:2:3,9 --> 0:2:6,55
The pre-track briefing
stipulated, no drifting.


48
0:2:6,55 --> 0:2:9,49
Talk about red rag to a bull.


49
0:2:9,49 --> 0:2:12,22
So here we are at Estoril.


50
0:2:12,22 --> 0:2:14,48
Four laps.


51
0:2:14,48 --> 0:2:16,88
And, curiously, in the briefing


52
0:2:16,88 --> 0:2:20,686
at the end, no drifting.


53
0:2:20,686 --> 0:2:25,5
I'm a bit like a 14-year-old
being told not to smoke, when


54
0:2:25,5 --> 0:2:26,78
someone says, no drifting.


55
0:2:26,78 --> 0:2:29,58
It's a bit, red rag to a bull.


56
0:2:29,58 --> 0:2:32,47
So I'm going to try and resist
drifting, cause it's not big,


57
0:2:32,47 --> 0:2:34,19
and it's not clever.


58
0:2:34,19 --> 0:2:35,65
But this is a rear-wheel
drive BMW.


59
0:2:35,65 --> 0:2:39,11
And what are rear-wheel drive
BMWs for, if not to kind of


60
0:2:39,11 --> 0:2:40,33
play with the back of the car?


61
0:2:40,33 --> 0:2:40,94
Isn't that the whole point?


62
0:2:40,94 --> 0:2:42,64
Otherwise you just buy
an Audi, don't you?


63
0:2:42,64 --> 0:2:43,74
I don't know.


64
0:2:43,74 --> 0:2:45,275
We'll discuss that later on.


65
0:2:45,275 --> 0:2:46,56
What have we got here then?


66
0:2:46,56 --> 0:2:50,47
We have a strange car, because
this is 10,000 pounds more


67
0:2:50,47 --> 0:2:56,55
than an M135i, and yet,
it has less torque.


68
0:2:56,55 --> 0:2:59,7
So I'm not quite sure what
they're trying to do in


69
0:2:59,7 --> 0:3:1,52
performance terms.


70
0:3:1,52 --> 0:3:3,54
The chassis immediately
feels better balanced.


71
0:3:3,54 --> 0:3:7,34
Longer wheelbase, everything
about it just feels a little


72
0:3:7,34 --> 0:3:9,891
bit more grown up.


73
0:3:9,891 --> 0:3:11,96
And I really like the
rear axle location.


74
0:3:11,96 --> 0:3:14,34
The rear axle is far better
located in this car than it is


75
0:3:14,34 --> 0:3:15,41
in the 1 Series.


76
0:3:15,41 --> 0:3:17,85
It deals with this torque
without thinking about it.


77
0:3:17,85 --> 0:3:18,76
Steering--


78
0:3:18,76 --> 0:3:20,65
really nice and quick,
actually.


79
0:3:20,65 --> 0:3:21,85
Very impressed by that.


80
0:3:21,85 --> 0:3:24,705
Brake pedal-- firm.


81
0:3:24,705 --> 0:3:26,5
Why am I doing this
on the track?


82
0:3:26,5 --> 0:3:28,96
Who's going to come and do
a track in their 435i?


83
0:3:28,96 --> 0:3:30,215
Not many people.


84
0:3:30,215 --> 0:3:32,23
We're just on a normal
street tire.


85
0:3:32,23 --> 0:3:36,1
But even so, the performance
of the car.


86
0:3:36,1 --> 0:3:39,3
A few years ago, this would have
been just about bordering


87
0:3:39,3 --> 0:3:41,38
on supercar performance.


88
0:3:41,38 --> 0:3:43,11
It's incredible.


89
0:3:43,11 --> 0:3:43,71
Transmission--


90
0:3:43,71 --> 0:3:46,83
love this 8-speed ZF.


91
0:3:46,83 --> 0:3:49,97
I know I crap on about it,
but it's just so good.


92
0:3:49,97 --> 0:3:52,735
Matched with this turbo-charged
straight-six, it


93
0:3:52,735 --> 0:3:54,27
works brilliantly, really
brilliantly.


94
0:3:54,27 --> 0:3:57,298



95
0:3:57,298 --> 0:4:0,332
Remember, no drifting
please, no drifting.


96
0:4:0,332 --> 0:4:1,57
and I mean, no drifting.


97
0:4:1,57 --> 0:4:5,5
[CAR ENGINE]


98
0:4:5,5 --> 0:4:6,3
Okay, no drifting.


99
0:4:6,3 --> 0:4:10,72



100
0:4:10,72 --> 0:4:13,977
BMW, I mean, it's a bit like
leaving plates of cake out at


101
0:4:13,977 --> 0:4:15,68
tea-time, and saying,
don't eat it.


102
0:4:15,68 --> 0:4:18,329
Your cars are brilliant
at going sideways, so


103
0:4:18,329 --> 0:4:20,14
I'm going to do it.


104
0:4:20,14 --> 0:4:21,42
Morally wrong not to.


105
0:4:21,42 --> 0:4:24,5



106
0:4:24,5 --> 0:4:26,482
Really nice chassis.


107
0:4:26,482 --> 0:4:29,22
I get the hint of what
an M3 might be like


108
0:4:29,22 --> 0:4:30,13
now, it's pretty exciting.


109
0:4:30,13 --> 0:4:32,44
Because this structure
is stiff.


110
0:4:32,44 --> 0:4:34,205
Everything about it
is high quality.


111
0:4:34,205 --> 0:4:37,687



112
0:4:37,687 --> 0:4:41,38
Can a BMW be called
a 4 Series?


113
0:4:41,38 --> 0:4:42,77
That's a philosophical
question.


114
0:4:42,77 --> 0:4:45,55
That's a deeply philosophical
question, isn't it?


115
0:4:45,55 --> 0:4:47,6
I'm not sure it can, actually.


116
0:4:47,6 --> 0:4:50,7
I struggle with the
group four.


117
0:4:50,7 --> 0:4:51,87
It doesn't sound quite
right to me.


118
0:4:51,87 --> 0:4:57,54
[CAR ENGINE]


119
0:4:57,54 --> 0:4:59,91
This guy has more performance
than most of the people that


120
0:4:59,91 --> 0:5:1,75
buy it will ever need, OK?


121
0:5:1,75 --> 0:5:5,18
It really does.


122
0:5:5,18 --> 0:5:6,362
But--


123
0:5:6,362 --> 0:5:9,17
and there is a "but" here, as
I cruise into the pit lane.


124
0:5:9,17 --> 0:5:13,5
The "but," for me, is that
despite driving so well, and


125
0:5:13,5 --> 0:5:16,45
being so fast, this is quite
an ordinary-feeling car.


126
0:5:16,45 --> 0:5:16,79
You know?


127
0:5:16,79 --> 0:5:19,27
It doesn't feel that special
to me at all.


128
0:5:19,27 --> 0:5:21,54
Well over 40 grand in the UK.


129
0:5:21,54 --> 0:5:24,25
Cabin is quite ordinary
3 Series.


130
0:5:24,25 --> 0:5:26,59
The whole thing is
quite ordinary.


131
0:5:26,59 --> 0:5:27,78
Leaves a lot of space
for the M3.


132
0:5:27,78 --> 0:5:31,49
A lot of space for the M3.


133
0:5:31,49 --> 0:5:34,27
And so, underneath all that
gloss and perfection, there


134
0:5:34,27 --> 0:5:36,75
really is a very good
performance car.


135
0:5:36,75 --> 0:5:39,51
One that keeps BMW well ahead
of its German rivals in this


136
0:5:39,51 --> 0:5:41,1
particular sector.


137
0:5:41,1 --> 0:5:43,87
And, as if to acknowledge the
fact that it might need some


138
0:5:43,87 --> 0:5:47,54
added spice, BMW will be
offering a load M Performance


139
0:5:47,54 --> 0:5:50,26
modifications as aftermarket
parts--


140
0:5:50,26 --> 0:5:53,135
suspension, brakes, a locking
differential, and a power kit


141
0:5:53,135 --> 0:5:56,74
that adds 34 horsepower, and
37 foot pounds of torque,


142
0:5:56,74 --> 0:6:0,68
taking it back up to kind
of M135i levels of poke.


143
0:6:0,68 --> 0:6:4,31
The only problem is, they
didn't let us drive one.


144
0:6:4,31 --> 0:6:5,55
Just remember--


145
0:6:5,55 --> 0:6:6,17
no drifting.


146

149
0:6:15,17 --> 0:6:15,66

Of course we're going to do
some drifting, you know?
