1
0:0:2,919 --> 0:0:13,79
Ancient people saw them as messages from the
Gods, as supernatural winds that blew from


2
0:0:13,79 --> 0:0:21,17
the realm of spirits.


3
0:0:21,17 --> 0:0:27,779
Modern science has linked these polar light
shows, called auroras, to vast waves of electrified


4
0:0:27,779 --> 0:0:34,68
gas hurled in our direction by the sun.


5
0:0:34,68 --> 0:0:45,51
Today, researchers from a whole new generation
see this dynamic substance, plasma, as an


6
0:0:45,51 --> 0:0:55,829
energy source that may one day fuel humanityÕs
expansion into space.


7
0:0:55,829 --> 0:1:13,909
What can we learn, and how far can we go,
by tapping into the strange and elusive fourth


8
0:1:13,909 --> 0:1:28,729
state of matter?


9
0:1:28,729 --> 0:1:34,609
Since the dawn of rocketry, weÕve relied
on the same basic technology to get us off


10
0:1:34,609 --> 0:1:43,81
the ground. Fill a cylinder with volatile
chemicals, then ignite them in a controlled


11
0:1:43,81 --> 0:1:46,329
explosion.


12
0:1:46,329 --> 0:1:50,679
The force of the blast is what pushes the
rocket up.


13
0:1:50,679 --> 0:1:57,49
Nowadays, chemical rockets are the only ones
with enough thrust to overcome EarthÕs gravity


14
0:1:57,49 --> 0:2:2,28
and carry a payload into orbit. But they are
not very efficient.


15
0:2:2,28 --> 0:2:11,98
The heavier the payload, the more fuel a rocket
needs to lift it into space. But the more


16
0:2:11,98 --> 0:2:17,75
fuel a rocket carries, the more fuel it needs.


17
0:2:17,75 --> 0:2:24,15
For long-range missions, most spacecraft rely
on their initial launch speed to essentially


18
0:2:24,15 --> 0:2:27,739
coast to their destination.


19
0:2:27,739 --> 0:2:33,849
Flight planners often design routes that give
the craft a gravity assist by sending it around


20
0:2:33,849 --> 0:2:41,61
the moon or another planet.


21
0:2:41,61 --> 0:2:46,68
One small cadre of scientists believes it
has a quicker and more efficient way to get


22
0:2:46,68 --> 0:2:48,549
around in space.


23
0:2:48,549 --> 0:2:56,54
Dr. Ben Longmier and his team from the University
of Michigan have traveled to Fairbanks, Alaska


24
0:2:56,54 --> 0:3:4,439
to play a small part in a much larger push
to revolutionize space travel and exploration.


25
0:3:4,439 --> 0:3:10,629
The team plans to use helium balloons to send
components of a new type of rocket engine


26
0:3:10,629 --> 0:3:20,29
to an altitude of over 30 kilometers, above
99% of EarthÕs atmosphere.


27
0:3:20,29 --> 0:3:28,489
The purpose is to test these components within
the harsh environment of space.


28
0:3:28,489 --> 0:3:35,709
While astronauts train to live and work in
zero gravity, or to move around in bulky space


29
0:3:35,709 --> 0:3:43,769
suits, these would-be space explorers are
preparing to negotiate some of EarthÕs harshest


30
0:3:43,769 --> 0:3:46,29
environments.


31
0:3:46,29 --> 0:3:51,959
Once they launch their payload, they have
to retrieve it wherever it comes down in AlaskaÕs


32
0:3:51,959 --> 0:4:1,5
vast snowy wilderness. The idea they are pursuing
is nothing short of revolutionary.


33
0:4:1,5 --> 0:4:8,129
ItÕs a type of rocket that promises far greater
gas mileage than other rockets, and enough


34
0:4:8,129 --> 0:4:12,5
power to reach distant targets.


35
0:4:12,5 --> 0:4:19,86
It runs on the same fuel that nature uses,
literally, to power the universe.


36
0:4:19,86 --> 0:4:33,5
To understand it, we go back to the early
moments of time and space.


37
0:4:33,5 --> 0:4:39,63
Not long after its explosive beginnings, the
universe was awash in vast stores of hydrogen


38
0:4:39,63 --> 0:4:43,66
gas.


39
0:4:43,66 --> 0:4:49,98
But even as the universe continued to expand,
gravity began to draw clumps of matter into


40
0:4:49,98 --> 0:4:59,2
ever-denser concentrations. The earliest stars
took shape, immense balls of hydrogen gas,


41
0:4:59,2 --> 0:5:3,0
hundreds of times the mass of our sun.


42
0:5:3,0 --> 0:5:9,7
As they contracted inward, they heated up
and ignited.


43
0:5:9,7 --> 0:5:15,69
Intense radiation now began to flow through
the voids. That had the effect, all through


44
0:5:15,69 --> 0:5:22,92
the universe, of stripping electrons away
from the primordial gas.


45
0:5:22,92 --> 0:5:29,23
The universe became filled, not with solids,
liquid, or gas, but with a fourth state of


46
0:5:29,23 --> 0:5:35,37
matter: plasma.


47
0:5:35,37 --> 0:5:48,62
On our planet, plasma occurs only in rare
circumstances: in a hot flame, a bolt of lightning,


48
0:5:48,62 --> 0:5:52,73
or in a blown electrical transformer.


49
0:5:52,73 --> 0:5:58,89
Made up of negatively charged electrons and
positively charged ions, plasma is in most


50
0:5:58,89 --> 0:6:6,19
cases electrically neutral since the charges
balance each other out.


51
0:6:6,19 --> 0:6:13,69
That led the physicist Irving Langmuir in
the 1920s to compare it to the clear liquid,


52
0:6:13,69 --> 0:6:17,0
plasma, that carries blood cells through our
bodies.


53
0:6:17,0 --> 0:6:23,65
The development of radio led to the discovery,
high above the Earth, of a natural plasma


54
0:6:23,65 --> 0:6:31,69
ceiling, the ionosphere. It hovers above us,
reflecting some radio frequencies and absorbing


55
0:6:31,69 --> 0:6:34,95
others.


56
0:6:34,95 --> 0:6:40,91
The discovery of immense radiation belts beyond
our atmosphere opened the way to the study


57
0:6:40,91 --> 0:6:46,24
of plasma in space.


58
0:6:46,24 --> 0:6:55,74
Unlike most matter on Earth, plasma conducts
electricity and responds to magnetic fields.


59
0:6:55,74 --> 0:7:3,47
These properties influence the formation of
structures like galaxies and nebulae.


60
0:7:3,47 --> 0:7:16,53
They power high velocity jets that roar out
of newborn stars or black holes.


61
0:7:16,53 --> 0:7:22,18
Studies of one giant nearby ball of plasma
show what a complex and volatile substance


62
0:7:22,18 --> 0:7:28,74
it can be.


63
0:7:28,74 --> 0:7:37,4
In the core of our sun, high heat and crushing
pressures cause hydrogen atoms to crash together.


64
0:7:37,4 --> 0:7:43,25
That sets off a nuclear reaction in which
hydrogen atoms fuse into heavier ones like


65
0:7:43,25 --> 0:7:48,66
helium and carbon, generating heat.


66
0:7:48,66 --> 0:7:56,31
This heat slowly rises to the surface of the
sun in vast plumes of plasma.


67
0:7:56,31 --> 0:8:2,6
You can see evidence of this process, called
convection, in a pattern of ever evolving


68
0:8:2,6 --> 0:8:5,28
blobs known as granules.


69
0:8:5,28 --> 0:8:12,64
They are like the tops of thunderstorms.


70
0:8:12,64 --> 0:8:20,65
Even as energy builds within, the sunÕs gravity
and density can stifle its escape.


71
0:8:20,65 --> 0:8:31,96
What carries it out are magnetic fields generated
by the rising and sinking motion of hot plasma.


72
0:8:31,96 --> 0:8:37,519
They twist and wrap around, channeling energy
to the surface.


73
0:8:37,519 --> 0:8:47,939
The fields can power immense loops of hot
gas, about 60,000 degrees Celsius, that rise


74
0:8:47,939 --> 0:8:55,939
up from the solar surface and fall back.


75
0:8:55,939 --> 0:9:11,959
The sun can also erupt in giant waves of plasma
that fly out from its surface.


76
0:9:11,959 --> 0:9:18,639
Called coronal mass ejections, they can reach
up to 6 million miles per hour as they hurtle


77
0:9:18,639 --> 0:9:22,19
out across the solar system.


78
0:9:22,19 --> 0:9:42,629
When the solar wave strikes, it slams into
EarthÕs own magnetic field.


79
0:9:42,629 --> 0:9:48,519
Because solar particles are charged, a portion
follows the orientation of EarthÕs magnetic


80
0:9:48,519 --> 0:9:57,48
field lines. Finding an opening at the poles,
they race down into the atmosphere.


81
0:9:57,48 --> 0:10:10,24
You know this is happening when you see the
beautiful lights of the aurora borealis in


82
0:10:10,24 --> 0:10:18,66
the far north, or the aurora australis in
the south.


83
0:10:18,66 --> 0:10:25,779
They appear when charged solar particles collide
with oxygen molecules in the upper atmosphere,


84
0:10:25,779 --> 0:10:49,42
causing them to glow blue, red, and green
depending on altitude.


85
0:10:49,42 --> 0:10:56,339
Flying through a zone called the thermosphere,
some 350 kilometers above the earth, astronauts


86
0:10:56,339 --> 0:11:2,589
in the international space station watch in
awe as the aurora shimmers, framed by the


87
0:11:2,589 --> 0:11:12,339
glow of stars and cities at night.


88
0:11:12,339 --> 0:11:22,24
ItÕs the explosive properties of plasma that
have motivated the collaboration between NASA,


89
0:11:22,24 --> 0:11:30,3
BenÕs team, and a company that heÕs affiliated
with: the Ad Astra Rocket Company of Houston,


90
0:11:30,3 --> 0:11:32,6
Texas.


91
0:11:32,6 --> 0:11:37,689
Because plasma does not occur naturally on
Earth, the challenge is to create it, then


92
0:11:37,689 --> 0:11:44,11
harness it in a rocket engine.


93
0:11:44,11 --> 0:11:50,8
In the lab, the teams do this by injecting
argon gas into a chamber. They bombard it


94
0:11:50,8 --> 0:11:58,569
with radio waves, which strip electrons from
the gas and turn it into a plasma.


95
0:11:58,569 --> 0:12:4,839
The soup of electrons and ions accelerates
as it moves through a magnetic field generated


96
0:12:4,839 --> 0:12:11,379
by superconducting magnets. Then itÕs hit
with a second blast of radio waves that heats


97
0:12:11,379 --> 0:12:13,399
it up to a million degrees Celsius.


98
0:12:13,399 --> 0:12:22,699
This hot plasma blasts out the back and propels
the craft.


99
0:12:22,699 --> 0:12:29,22
As part of their design process, Ben and team
are testing some of the specialized components


100
0:12:29,22 --> 0:12:34,73
of their rocket in the harsh environment of
space.


101
0:12:34,73 --> 0:13:10,9
A simple frame will carry an array of novel
sensors. One holds a colony 


102
0:13:10,9 --> 0:13:13,319
of bacteria.


103
0:13:13,319 --> 0:13:19,959
Another is a series of tiny GoPro cameras
converted to record the intensity of infrared


104
0:13:19,959 --> 0:13:25,4
and ultraviolet light normally hidden to the
human eye.


105
0:13:25,4 --> 0:13:32,329
Argon gas is used to insulate instruments
against the cold, with chemical packets added


106
0:13:32,329 --> 0:13:36,249
for warmth.


107
0:13:36,249 --> 0:13:48,529
The frame is stabilized with tiny gyroscopes,
and outfitted with GPS devices for tracking.


108
0:13:48,529 --> 0:13:57,329
The idea of using plasma to power rockets
is not a new one.


109
0:13:57,329 --> 0:14:3,509
The Polish physicist Stanislav Ulam is said
to have been inspired by atom bomb tests in


110
0:14:3,509 --> 0:14:12,379
the 1940s. He speculated that waves of plasma
from small nuclear detonations could propel


111
0:14:12,379 --> 0:14:19,249
a spacecraft to extreme speeds.


112
0:14:19,249 --> 0:14:26,649
In the 1950s, that idea animated dreams of
exploring the solar system in spacecraft like


113
0:14:26,649 --> 0:14:33,189
this 360-ton Mars-bound vehicle.


114
0:14:33,189 --> 0:14:39,379
The idea gained funding in the Orion project,
with the idea of driving a spacecraft with


115
0:14:39,379 --> 0:14:48,199
nuclear pulses and landing on Mars in only
a month. Concerns about radioactive exhaust


116
0:14:48,199 --> 0:14:55,629
helped doom the project.


117
0:14:55,629 --> 0:15:1,879
Plasma rockets, energized by nuclear reactions,
were revived in the Daedalus and Nerva projects


118
0:15:1,879 --> 0:15:8,579
of the 1960s, and again at the beginning of
this century as part of a journey to JupiterÕs


119
0:15:8,579 --> 0:15:13,939
moon Europa. Rising costs killed that mission.


120
0:15:13,939 --> 0:15:22,579
BenÕs efforts rely on simpler, far less expensive
methods.


121
0:15:22,579 --> 0:15:30,85
Their payload has flown all night up to an
altitude of over 100,000 feet. Then in the


122
0:15:30,85 --> 0:15:53,79
low air pressure, the balloon burst and the
payload parachuted to the ground.


123
0:15:53,79 --> 0:16:7,5
They know exactly where it is. But that doesnÕt
mean retrieving it will be easy.


124
0:16:7,5 --> 0:16:13,98
It takes nearly all day to travel well-packed
trails to a point about seven miles from their


125
0:16:13,98 --> 0:16:34,619
prize. The rest of the way will take them
through forests and over hills.


126
0:16:34,619 --> 0:16:57,59
A brave attempt through the deep snow. The
team gets to within two miles.


127
0:16:57,59 --> 0:17:6,73
The next day, a long hike and snow shoes finally
gets them to the payload.


128
0:17:6,73 --> 0:17:26,74
To this team, the effort is worth it, for
plasma rockets could finally have their day.


129
0:17:26,74 --> 0:17:33,59
A real world test, being designed by the private
company, Ad Astra, could take place as early


130
0:17:33,59 --> 0:17:38,7
as 2016.


131
0:17:38,7 --> 0:17:43,53
It fits a real world need.


132
0:17:43,53 --> 0:17:49,2
Flying at an altitude of three hundred fifty
kilometers, the International Space Station


133
0:17:49,2 --> 0:17:55,32
whips around the Earth every one and a half
hours.


134
0:17:55,32 --> 0:18:3,56
To stay aloft, it must maintain a speed of
28,000 kilometers per hour. But its solar


135
0:18:3,56 --> 0:18:9,93
panels and crew modules smack into so many
tiny molecules in the upper atmosphere that


136
0:18:9,93 --> 0:18:14,71
it gradually slows down and loses altitude.


137
0:18:14,71 --> 0:18:22,81
To stay aloft, the station uses up around
4,000 kilograms of fuel per year. That fuel


138
0:18:22,81 --> 0:18:28,44
must be flown up from Earth, which in turn
reduces the amount of food, water, people,


139
0:18:28,44 --> 0:18:34,9
and equipment that a resupply mission can
deliver.


140
0:18:34,9 --> 0:18:42,4
The idea is to use a plasma rocket to help
boost the station to a higher altitude, powered


141
0:18:42,4 --> 0:18:49,32
by electricity generated by solar panels aboard
the station.


142
0:18:49,32 --> 0:18:57,5
Ben is also working on lower power rockets
for much smaller spacecraft. The idea is to


143
0:18:57,5 --> 0:19:3,35
mount them on tiny desktop-sized craft called
Cube Sats.


144
0:19:3,35 --> 0:19:9,39
Based on this miniature model, he imagines
sending small, solar-powered rockets to remote


145
0:19:9,39 --> 0:19:16,32
locations in the solar system to collect scientific
data, prospect for minerals, or even look


146
0:19:16,32 --> 0:19:20,77
for evidence of life.


147
0:19:20,77 --> 0:19:27,42
From there, the idea is to one day scale up
the technology to power a human mission to


148
0:19:27,42 --> 0:19:30,71
Mars.


149
0:19:30,71 --> 0:19:36,99
After weeks spent accelerating in earth orbit,
the rocket would make a break for Mars. Cutting


150
0:19:36,99 --> 0:19:43,1
flight time from a year to several months
would lower costs and crew hazards.


151
0:19:43,1 --> 0:19:52,97
BenÕs ultimate goal is to help boost a whole
new approach to space travel thatÕs now emerging.


152
0:19:52,97 --> 0:20:4,92
May 2012 marked a major milestone in the rise
of free enterprise in space. The SpaceX Company


153
0:20:4,92 --> 0:20:13,0
successfully docked an unmanned space capsule
with the International Space Station. It followed


154
0:20:13,0 --> 0:20:19,15
that up six months later with the first commercial
resupply mission.


155
0:20:19,15 --> 0:20:35,29
ThatÕs just the beginning. NASA is looking
to companies to supply orbital launch services,


156
0:20:35,29 --> 0:20:46,28
and to be long-term partners in future manned
missions beyond the moon.


157
0:20:46,28 --> 0:20:53,0
Hoping to make big bucks, companies are developing
orbital habitats and space planes, laying


158
0:20:53,0 --> 0:21:3,8
the groundwork for missions geared to mining,
exploration, and even tourism.


159
0:21:3,8 --> 0:21:14,45
To Ben, this new race to space will go to
the swift and 
the innovative.


160
0:21:14,45 --> 0:21:19,89
Today, because of weather and winds, he and
his team have chosen to launch their payload


161
0:21:19,89 --> 0:21:31,15
from the spectacular Ruth Glacier in Denali
National Park.


162
0:21:31,15 --> 0:21:37,63
Amid the rugged terrain, this immense river
of ice sweeps down into a perfect natural


163
0:21:37,63 --> 0:22:4,16
runway.


164
0:22:4,16 --> 0:22:17,97
With dusk approaching, balloon and payload
are ready.


165
0:22:17,97 --> 0:22:58,73
The balloon drifts up through the dense polar
air.


166
0:22:58,73 --> 0:23:4,87
With night falling, it rises up to the edge
of space.


167
0:23:4,87 --> 0:23:16,88
Meanwhile, overhead, a solar storm is raging.


168
0:23:16,88 --> 0:23:23,52
Aboard the International Space Station, astronaut
Don Pettit is making observations to complement


169
0:23:23,52 --> 0:23:28,42
what BenÕs team finds.


170
0:23:28,42 --> 0:23:35,13
He passes over the Arctic several times during
the balloonÕs flight.


171
0:23:35,13 --> 0:23:40,71
The auroras he photographs are an indicator
of the amount of solar particles that will


172
0:23:40,71 --> 0:23:44,15
pummel BenÕs rocket components.


173
0:23:44,15 --> 0:23:51,74
This is a time of high solar activity, approaching
the peak of an 11-year cycle.
