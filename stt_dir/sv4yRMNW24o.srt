0:0:14,84 --> 0:0:17,4
SUROOSH ALVI: Since it was the
Muslim holy month of Muharram,


4
0:0:17,4 --> 0:0:20,27
which is especially significant
for the Shia, we


5
0:0:20,27 --> 0:0:22,51
decided to head to Sadr City.


6
0:0:22,51 --> 0:0:23,41
It's Friday.


7
0:0:23,41 --> 0:0:25,84
We're going to check
out the big prayer.


8
0:0:25,84 --> 0:0:27,71
Apparently, it's a
sight to be seen.


9
0:0:27,71 --> 0:0:30,87
Everybody prays on the streets
for a huge distance from the


10
0:0:30,87 --> 0:0:33,5
mosque all the way out.


11
0:0:33,5 --> 0:0:36,3
Now, just a few years back, the
idea of Westerners paying


12
0:0:36,3 --> 0:0:39,39
a little visit to Sadr City
would have been unthinkable as


13
0:0:39,39 --> 0:0:41,7
it was the heart of the
insurgency against the


14
0:0:41,7 --> 0:0:43,12
American occupation--


15
0:0:43,12 --> 0:0:46,4
the home of firebrand cleric
Muqtada Al-Sadr


16
0:0:46,4 --> 0:0:48,19
and his Mahdi Army.


17
0:0:48,19 --> 0:0:51,4
Even now, it took a lot of work
and a Mahdi Army escort


18
0:0:51,4 --> 0:0:52,686
to get us in.


19
0:0:52,686 --> 0:0:54,98
It's supposedly forbidden
to fight during


20
0:0:54,98 --> 0:0:56,12
the month of Muharram.


21
0:0:56,12 --> 0:0:59,6
But with heightened Sunni-Shia
tensions, the Iraqi army


22
0:0:59,6 --> 0:1:2,37
thought it was a good idea to
have the bomb squad present


23
0:1:2,37 --> 0:1:3,62
just in case.

SUROOSH ALVI: More than 13,000
people turned out to pray and


29
0:1:21,79 --> 0:1:24,8
to listen to a cleric who
influences the attitudes of an


30
0:1:24,8 --> 0:1:28,127
even greater number of
Iraq's Shia majority.

about the westernization of


34
0:2:3,21 --> 0:2:6,62
Iraqi youth since the American
occupation and


35
0:2:6,62 --> 0:2:7,6

38

SUROOSH ALVI: The cleric made
it clear that getting the US


39
0:2:30,365 --> 0:2:32,226
out of Iraq wasn't enough.


40
0:2:32,226 --> 0:2:35,95
He wants to eliminate American
influence of any kind.


41
0:2:35,95 --> 0:2:38,0
We headed back to the
neighborhood of Karrada to


42
0:2:38,0 --> 0:2:41,35
meet up with Waleed and get
a tour of his old haunts.


43
0:2:41,35 --> 0:2:42,496
Hey, welcome to Iraq, buddy.


44
0:2:42,496 --> 0:2:44,84
Welcome home.


45
0:2:44,84 --> 0:2:47,18
Waleed wanted to check out
Acrassicauda's old practice


46
0:2:47,18 --> 0:2:50,606
space, that is, if
we could find it.


47
0:2:50,606 --> 0:2:53,3
There's a strange feeling
walking around, considering


48
0:2:53,3 --> 0:2:56,2
the last time I was here I
wasn't even allowed to get out


49
0:2:56,2 --> 0:2:57,92
of our armored car.


50
0:2:57,92 --> 0:3:0,56
WALEED: It's been a very, very
long time since I've last


51
0:3:0,56 --> 0:3:2,35
walked this street.


52
0:3:2,35 --> 0:3:6,65
This is filled with memories
of starving nights with the


53
0:3:6,65 --> 0:3:10,53
band hitting the shit out of the
instruments, rocking out,


54
0:3:10,53 --> 0:3:13,12
and trying to figure out--
how the fuck are we


55
0:3:13,12 --> 0:3:13,47
going to go back home?


56
0:3:13,47 --> 0:3:15,27
SUROOSH ALVI: This is basically
10 years ago.


57
0:3:15,27 --> 0:3:16,52
WALEED: Yeah.


58
0:3:16,52 --> 0:3:18,48



59
0:3:18,48 --> 0:3:19,16
This is it.


60
0:3:19,16 --> 0:3:20,261
SUROOSH ALVI: It's
been rebuilt.


61
0:3:20,261 --> 0:3:25,1
WALEED: Yep, completely
changed now.


62
0:3:25,1 --> 0:3:29,1
SUROOSH ALVI: It's like
art galleries.


63
0:3:29,1 --> 0:3:31,77
If we hadn't been sure this was
the spot, we would have


64
0:3:31,77 --> 0:3:32,75
walked right by it.


65
0:3:32,75 --> 0:3:35,31
The practice space got
completely bombed


66
0:3:35,31 --> 0:3:36,49
out during the war.


67
0:3:36,49 --> 0:3:41,16
And today it's unrecognizable,
which I guess is a good thing.


68
0:3:41,16 --> 0:3:44,138
WALEED: The area changed
so much that it


69
0:3:44,138 --> 0:3:46,97
looks completely different.


70
0:3:46,97 --> 0:3:48,83
SUROOSH ALVI: Waleed wanted to
see if his childhood home was


71
0:3:48,83 --> 0:3:49,73
still standing.


72
0:3:49,73 --> 0:3:53,24
But on our way there, we were
re-introduced to one of the


73
0:3:53,24 --> 0:3:55,29
most notorious features
of Baghdad--


74
0:3:55,29 --> 0:3:57,99
checkpoints.


75
0:3:57,99 --> 0:4:1,24
Car bombs are such an issue in
Baghdad that hundreds of the


76
0:4:1,24 --> 0:4:3,36
checkpoints that were originally
established by the


77
0:4:3,36 --> 0:4:6,59
American military are still
in place today.


78
0:4:6,59 --> 0:4:8,22
WALEED: Look at this
fucking shit, man.


79
0:4:8,22 --> 0:4:11,34
Have you noticed, every street
has a checkpoint, every area


80
0:4:11,34 --> 0:4:13,27
has a checkpoint of
entrance and exit.


81
0:4:13,27 --> 0:4:15,25
It's so sad.


82
0:4:15,25 --> 0:4:18,6
Literally, you have to plan
your day to the T.


83
0:4:18,6 --> 0:4:20,87
SUROOSH ALVI: Because it
slows everything down.


84
0:4:20,87 --> 0:4:23,82
Not only does it make getting
around a nightmare, but doing


85
0:4:23,82 --> 0:4:26,41
anything other than staring
straight ahead and hoping you


86
0:4:26,41 --> 0:4:29,53
get through can throw your
entire day into a tailspin.


87
0:4:29,53 --> 0:4:31,63
Put it down.


88
0:4:31,63 --> 0:4:32,645
What are they saying?


89
0:4:32,645 --> 0:4:33,762
You can't film?


90
0:4:33,762 --> 0:4:37,11
WALEED: They're like, don't
film near a police patrol.


91
0:4:37,11 --> 0:4:39,25
SUROOSH ALVI: After inspecting
our press credentials and


92
0:4:39,25 --> 0:4:41,99
undergoing a thorough search, we
were allowed to slowly make


93
0:4:41,99 --> 0:4:44,77
our way to Waleed's old house.


94
0:4:44,77 --> 0:4:47,4
WALEED: Everything
is blockaded.


95
0:4:47,4 --> 0:4:49,705
You can't really access the
house or the neighborhood.


96
0:4:49,705 --> 0:4:52,43
So we had to turn around, go
all the way back, and then


97
0:4:52,43 --> 0:4:53,87
come through here.


98
0:4:53,87 --> 0:4:55,712
SUROOSH ALVI: Did it get bombed,
this neighborhood?


99
0:4:55,712 --> 0:4:57,84
WALEED: Yeah, and it looks
pretty fucking different.


100
0:4:57,84 --> 0:5:10,0



101
0:5:10,0 --> 0:5:12,8
That's pretty fucking insane.


102
0:5:12,8 --> 0:5:13,715
This used to be my
old library.


103
0:5:13,715 --> 0:5:20,184



104
0:5:20,184 --> 0:5:24,92
It's like a fucking
junkyard, man.


105
0:5:24,92 --> 0:5:26,82
SUROOSH ALVI: Right before
Waleed left the country, he


106
0:5:26,82 --> 0:5:28,87
received a series of
death threats.


107
0:5:28,87 --> 0:5:31,59
His work as a fixer for foreign
journalists and as a


108
0:5:31,59 --> 0:5:34,65
member of a heavy metal band
made him a target.


109
0:5:34,65 --> 0:5:35,94
WALEED: I'll show
you right here.


110
0:5:35,94 --> 0:5:38,99
So at 6:00 in the morning,
I would leave.


111
0:5:38,99 --> 0:5:43,97
And there was a note right here,
an envelope, right here.


112
0:5:43,97 --> 0:5:48,82
And when I opened it, it was a
very, very frank letter of--


113
0:5:48,82 --> 0:5:53,37
we shall cleanse the soil of our
country from the stench of


114
0:5:53,37 --> 0:5:54,7
people like you.


115
0:5:54,7 --> 0:5:57,18
So I went kind of crazy, and I
went into the street, and I


116
0:5:57,18 --> 0:5:59,8
started screaming and yelling,
like if you're a man just come


117
0:5:59,8 --> 0:6:0,66
up right now.


118
0:6:0,66 --> 0:6:4,14
I came back after two weeks, and
I left at a different time


119
0:6:4,14 --> 0:6:6,2
this time in the morning.


120
0:6:6,2 --> 0:6:9,5
And there was another
one of those.


121
0:6:9,5 --> 0:6:9,82
SUROOSH ALVI: Waiting for
you when you walked in.


122
0:6:9,82 --> 0:6:10,55
WALEED: Waiting for me.


123
0:6:10,55 --> 0:6:14,35
So what I realized is that the
person who had dropped it had


124
0:6:14,35 --> 0:6:19,52
to have been watching over from
somewhere around here,


125
0:6:19,52 --> 0:6:22,73
where he can see me leaving the
apartment and going down.


126
0:6:22,73 --> 0:6:25,14
And that's when I knew that
the danger was very, very


127
0:6:25,14 --> 0:6:28,79
imminent on my family
because of me.


128
0:6:28,79 --> 0:6:32,15
So yeah, three days after
that, I was in Jordan.


129
0:6:32,15 --> 0:6:34,37
SUROOSH ALVI: But the death
threats against anyone who's


130
0:6:34,37 --> 0:6:37,44
not on the straight and narrow
continue to this day.


131
0:6:37,44 --> 0:6:40,37
And as we would learn, these
threats are not empty.


132
0:6:40,37 --> 0:6:52,79
