1
0:0:0,7 --> 0:0:5,71
a california man wants to start to be
uh... uh... trial that would basically


2
0:0:5,71 --> 0:0:11,919
at happy scientist question the literal
interpretation of genesis so uh...


3
0:0:11,919 --> 0:0:16,289
in his name is doctor joseph master
apollo and he is a creationist


4
0:0:16,289 --> 0:0:20,75
he believes that uh... scientists have
absolutely no proof of that aleutian and


5
0:0:20,75 --> 0:0:25,849
that no scientists can't disprove the
literal interpretation of genesis so


6
0:0:25,849 --> 0:0:28,319
he's creating this so-called mini trial


7
0:0:28,319 --> 0:0:32,79
where he will i'd choose all listen
potential judges


8
0:0:32,79 --> 0:0:34,409
and the scientists that would adn


9
0:0:34,409 --> 0:0:35,48
debate him


10
0:0:35,48 --> 0:0:38,19
wud agree on one of the judges on the
list


11
0:0:38,19 --> 0:0:39,829
and then they would go ahead and debate


12
0:0:39,829 --> 0:0:45,58
and if the scientist wins he gets ten
thousand dollars


13
0:0:45,58 --> 0:0:47,3
how okie


14
0:0:47,3 --> 0:0:50,2
the so the sign this might have probable
being


15
0:0:50,2 --> 0:0:53,26
orders for reuniting saying okay


16
0:0:53,26 --> 0:0:56,83
genesis definitely didn't happen there
was no talking snake it's i don't know


17
0:0:56,83 --> 0:0:59,46
how you disprove that


18
0:0:59,46 --> 0:1:4,36
it's from his the creation of skin
pigment stability is so-so r_t_c_


19
0:1:4,36 --> 0:1:8,17
student of us would but how in the world
is this guy i think he's gonna win


20
0:1:8,17 --> 0:1:9,24
his case


21
0:1:9,24 --> 0:1:12,56
where he's gonna prove the genesis did
have


22
0:1:12,56 --> 0:1:13,69
at ok self


23
0:1:13,69 --> 0:1:16,9
i reread genesis today


24
0:1:16,9 --> 0:1:20,18
in the first after dot creates man-woman
right but then a second chapter what


25
0:1:20,18 --> 0:1:23,32
happened that when he created because
all of the site in adams light yellow


26
0:1:23,32 --> 0:1:25,13
like ten one one and bright


27
0:1:25,13 --> 0:1:29,1
dot offers animals in adams like man i
really into the animal's i'd like a


28
0:1:29,1 --> 0:1:34,23
female companion was afraid what initial
female companion sheila disappeared


29
0:1:34,23 --> 0:1:38,23

30
0:1:38,23 --> 0:1:39,2
woman


31
0:1:39,2 --> 0:1:40,34
desperate corporate


32
0:1:40,34 --> 0:1:43,83
and apparently people are living like
nearly a thousand years at that time


33
0:1:43,83 --> 0:1:47,21
i want so i know that that would be
really difficult to prove uh...


34
0:1:47,21 --> 0:1:50,84
scientifically but that we again so we
come back to the guy who's good for the


35
0:1:50,84 --> 0:1:52,32
winter though who knows


36
0:1:52,32 --> 0:1:54,2
proving this literally have


37
0:1:54,2 --> 0:1:56,21
okay you have a parking state


38
0:1:56,21 --> 0:1:57,45
yet you're gonna


39
0:1:57,45 --> 0:2:0,52
you know that goes with the opposing
years old


40
0:2:0,52 --> 0:2:3,71
and by the way so we have today is
arguing to your right to know in all


41
0:2:3,71 --> 0:2:7,6
these different cases is a copy of the
like insects


42
0:2:7,6 --> 0:2:8,53
bridal


43
0:2:8,53 --> 0:2:9,839
is set


44
0:2:9,839 --> 0:2:13,619
will leave you with a legally doses that
so we all started inserts


45
0:2:13,619 --> 0:2:15,94
haven't even had kids in the kids have
sex


46
0:2:15,94 --> 0:2:20,99
emigrated ups u


47
0:2:20,99 --> 0:2:22,49
but they didn't get mad at the rate


48
0:2:22,49 --> 0:2:24,529
but all the good wishes for the bible
too


49
0:2:24,529 --> 0:2:26,799
story about how they


50
0:2:26,799 --> 0:2:29,989
so some this is a guy that believes in
the literal interpretation of that now


51
0:2:29,989 --> 0:2:31,37
said like a billion times


52
0:2:31,37 --> 0:2:32,26
uh... but


53
0:2:32,26 --> 0:2:36,989
is yours again to say about scientists
he says may abolitionists are not stupid


54
0:2:36,989 --> 0:2:38,62
people there bright


55
0:2:38,62 --> 0:2:42,64
but they are bright enough to know there
is no scientific evidence they can get


56
0:2:42,64 --> 0:2:44,819
uh... in a mini trial


57
0:2:44,819 --> 0:2:48,979
uh... and you know he as as a contest
rules state that evidence must be


58
0:2:48,979 --> 0:2:54,19
scientific which means it is objective
valid reliable and calibrated


59
0:2:54,19 --> 0:2:57,459
is an interesting thing to say because
what kind of scientific evidence are you


60
0:2:57,459 --> 0:3:0,359
gonna provide


61
0:3:0,359 --> 0:3:2,139
on the job


62
0:3:2,139 --> 0:3:4,199
there's a little thing called miracles


63
0:3:4,199 --> 0:3:5,969
wouldn't do it


64
0:3:5,969 --> 0:5:5,969
