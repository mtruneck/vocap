9
0:0:11,38 --> 0:0:14,47
TYLER MANSON: Growing up in
Ventura, California, the


10
0:0:14,47 --> 0:0:18,21
Malloys were pretty much
the hometown heroes.


11
0:0:18,21 --> 0:0:21,8
And Dan, being the youngest of
the three brothers, I sort of


12
0:0:21,8 --> 0:0:26,2
watched closely as he went
through his competitive years


13
0:0:26,2 --> 0:0:30,39
and went from winning major
competitions to completely


14
0:0:30,39 --> 0:0:34,59
giving up competing and dropping
his major sponsors in


15
0:0:34,59 --> 0:0:38,78
order to spend more time at
home working with a local


16
0:0:38,78 --> 0:0:42,89
company, Patagonia, local
board builders, and just


17
0:0:42,89 --> 0:0:47,1
different ideas in terms of
buildings surfboards and what


18
0:0:47,1 --> 0:0:48,53
it means to be a pro surfer.


19
0:0:48,53 --> 0:0:49,97
This is a new car for you?


20
0:0:49,97 --> 0:0:53,21
DAN MALLOY: Yeah, me and my
brother, Keith, have been


21
0:0:53,21 --> 0:0:56,56
experimenting for last couple
years with just trying to use


22
0:0:56,56 --> 0:0:59,74
a little bit less
gas and stuff.


23
0:0:59,74 --> 0:1:2,6
And so we got this
little thing.


24
0:1:2,6 --> 0:1:7,85
I think it's an '82 VW Rabbit
truck, and it gets 40 miles to


25
0:1:7,85 --> 0:1:10,295
the gallon of diesel.


26
0:1:10,295 --> 0:1:12,1
Or we put biodiesel in it.


27
0:1:12,1 --> 0:1:14,33
I think this battery
pack's done.


28
0:1:14,33 --> 0:1:15,7
Round two.


29
0:1:15,7 --> 0:1:18,99
[ENGINE SOUNDS]


30
0:1:18,99 --> 0:1:21,44
TYLER MANSON: Nice.


31
0:1:21,44 --> 0:1:22,69
Nice.


32
0:1:22,69 --> 0:1:25,97



33
0:1:25,97 --> 0:1:30,173
RY CRAIKE: Dan's super mellow,
just absolutely rips.


34
0:1:30,173 --> 0:1:31,46
He charges.


35
0:1:31,46 --> 0:1:33,885
THOMAS CAMPBELL: The best.


36
0:1:33,885 --> 0:1:35,73
He's one of the most incredible


37
0:1:35,73 --> 0:1:37,44
athletes I've ever seen.


38
0:1:37,44 --> 0:1:40,55
One of the best tube riders
in the world, by far.


39
0:1:40,55 --> 0:1:41,73
ALEX KNOST: He's a nice guy.


40
0:1:41,73 --> 0:1:45,28
I think that's probably the most
inspirational thing about


41
0:1:45,28 --> 0:1:47,51
Dan is he's still a cool guy.


42
0:1:47,51 --> 0:1:50,72
And he's been there and done
that for so fucking long that


43
0:1:50,72 --> 0:1:52,9
you think he'd be a total
asshole, but he's


44
0:1:52,9 --> 0:1:55,12
pretty far from it.


45
0:1:55,12 --> 0:1:57,68
DAN MALLOY: So this whole area
is where I grew up and learned


46
0:1:57,68 --> 0:2:0,11
how to surf and where
my family and all


47
0:2:0,11 --> 0:2:1,7
my friends are from.


48
0:2:1,7 --> 0:2:4,673
This is where they blast the
Patagonia surfboards, and this


49
0:2:4,673 --> 0:2:6,21
is the retail store
right here.


50
0:2:6,21 --> 0:2:9,62
So it's really cool to be
working with them, because


51
0:2:9,62 --> 0:2:12,957
it's a part of our community,
rather than working for one of


52
0:2:12,957 --> 0:2:17,1
the surf companies down in San
Diego or Newport Beach, which


53
0:2:17,1 --> 0:2:20,89
I don't really have very much
interest in the scenes down


54
0:2:20,89 --> 0:2:23,74
there and the communities
down there.


55
0:2:23,74 --> 0:2:27,8
And so it's really, really fun
to be a part of something


56
0:2:27,8 --> 0:2:29,5
right at home.


57
0:2:29,5 --> 0:2:32,39
We were really clueless to the
whole surf scene when we were


58
0:2:32,39 --> 0:2:36,17
little kids, and this spot right
here, called Emma Wood,


59
0:2:36,17 --> 0:2:38,5
we thought it was the best
surf break in the world.


60
0:2:38,5 --> 0:2:41,85
We'd just come straight out
of Ojai, turn right on the


61
0:2:41,85 --> 0:2:48,14
freeway, and go right down
here to Emma Wood.


62
0:2:48,14 --> 0:2:50,742
It's a really neat spot.


63
0:2:50,742 --> 0:2:55,5
There's a little wedgie left
and a little right.


64
0:2:55,5 --> 0:2:57,526
There's a little left
right there.


65
0:2:57,526 --> 0:3:0,435
A bunch of the kids surf here
too, so it's fun to paddle out


66
0:3:0,435 --> 0:3:4,445
and check out all the groms,
see who's ripping.


67
0:3:4,445 --> 0:3:7,65
And just a ton of good memories
along this whole part


68
0:3:7,65 --> 0:3:9,1
of the coast.


69
0:3:9,1 --> 0:3:11,13
I think it's called Green Con
Parkway or something, but we


70
0:3:11,13 --> 0:3:14,46
always just called it Summer
Beach because it was one of


71
0:3:14,46 --> 0:3:15,495
the beaches that we would
go to in the summertime.


72
0:3:15,495 --> 0:3:18,96
And it was another place
that we thought was


73
0:3:18,96 --> 0:3:19,91
a really good wave.


74
0:3:19,91 --> 0:3:25,83
And it's fun, but it's not
a really good wave.


75
0:3:25,83 --> 0:3:29,9
So this is my brother,
Keith's, house,


76
0:3:29,9 --> 0:3:31,65
and I live here too.


77
0:3:31,65 --> 0:3:33,4
I rent a room from him.


78
0:3:33,4 --> 0:3:37,78
And we have a ton of
surfboards in here.


79
0:3:37,78 --> 0:3:44,45
It's kind of a collection
over our whole lives.


80
0:3:44,45 --> 0:3:46,575
ALEX KNOST: Dan's funny because
he can ride any kind


81
0:3:46,575 --> 0:3:47,3
of surfboard.


82
0:3:47,3 --> 0:3:49,28
MANUEL CARO: You put Dan Malloy
on a piece of wood with


83
0:3:49,28 --> 0:3:52,28
a door handle on it, and
he'll probably still


84
0:3:52,28 --> 0:3:53,47
surf better that you.


85
0:3:53,47 --> 0:3:56,23
CHRIS CHRISTENSON: He was one
of the first pro guys to


86
0:3:56,23 --> 0:4:0,164
really be open to trying
something besides their 6' 2",


87
0:4:0,164 --> 0:4:1,21
6' 3" thrusts.


88
0:4:1,21 --> 0:4:3,49
RY CRAIKE: Dan was definitely
riding some different boards,


89
0:4:3,49 --> 0:4:6,24
some of those wooden ones
and the quads and stuff.


90
0:4:6,24 --> 0:4:9,24
And it looked like they were
going insane for him.


91
0:4:9,24 --> 0:4:12,41
He'd just come flying out of
these pits, just right into


92
0:4:12,41 --> 0:4:14,3
the biggest carve.


93
0:4:14,3 --> 0:4:15,93
ALEX KNOST: It's encouraging,
but it's also


94
0:4:15,93 --> 0:4:16,8
belittling, you know?


95
0:4:16,8 --> 0:4:18,61
He's fucking that good.


96
0:4:18,61 --> 0:4:21,11
KASSIA MEADOR: He just surfs
so well and so insane, and


97
0:4:21,11 --> 0:4:26,18
it's just cool to have people
like that out there surfing


98
0:4:26,18 --> 0:4:29,37
and pushing the limits and
riding different boards.


99
0:4:29,37 --> 0:4:31,4
CHRIS CHRISTENSON: He's a good
enough surfer to feel what


100
0:4:31,4 --> 0:4:33,8
those boards have to offer, and
his mind was open enough


101
0:4:33,8 --> 0:4:35,91
where to put them to
get that feeling.


102
0:4:35,91 --> 0:4:38,73
From one of the first guys
that's showing up in the


103
0:4:38,73 --> 0:4:42,46
videos on that equipment and
ripping them in good ways, and


104
0:4:42,46 --> 0:4:44,89
then both doors just went
boom and everyone came


105
0:4:44,89 --> 0:4:45,475
rushing into it.


106
0:4:45,475 --> 0:4:48,25
TYLER MANSON: What's your
dad's surfing history?


107
0:4:48,25 --> 0:4:50,48
DAN MALLOY: He grew
up in Los Angeles.


108
0:4:50,48 --> 0:4:54,97
When they were 10 years old, he
moved to Topanga He wanted


109
0:4:54,97 --> 0:4:56,24
to learn how to surf.


110
0:4:56,24 --> 0:4:59,37
And one year, he asked his
parents for a surfboard for


111
0:4:59,37 --> 0:5:2,13
Christmas, and he
didn't get it.


112
0:5:2,13 --> 0:5:4,42
So I think he ripped
an old longboard


113
0:5:4,42 --> 0:5:7,7
apart, and made this.


114
0:5:7,7 --> 0:5:10,41
TYLER MANSON: He grew up with
a rough crowd of surfers?


115
0:5:10,41 --> 0:5:13,26
DAN MALLOY: Yeah, he was
actually the youngest of a


116
0:5:13,26 --> 0:5:14,44
crew of guys.


117
0:5:14,44 --> 0:5:16,7
They were called the
Topanga Bombers.


118
0:5:16,7 --> 0:5:21,24
And at that time, surfing
was rebel guys.


119
0:5:21,24 --> 0:5:23,79
And at his high school,
the Beach Boys played.


120
0:5:23,79 --> 0:5:26,9
He said him and his friends, the
Topanga Bombers, all came


121
0:5:26,9 --> 0:5:30,6
with eggs and egged the Beach
Boys off the stage.


122
0:5:30,6 --> 0:5:32,18
And they left and didn't
come back.


123
0:5:32,18 --> 0:5:34,4
And it was right at the
beginning of the dance.


124
0:5:34,4 --> 0:5:35,29
[LAUGHS].


125
0:5:35,29 --> 0:5:37,15



126
0:5:37,15 --> 0:5:41,26
This is that Rich Pavel from
Sprout, the finless one, and


127
0:5:41,26 --> 0:5:43,2
that board is really,
really good.


128
0:5:43,2 --> 0:5:44,74
TYLER MANSON: So you brought
that board to Sri Lanka?


129
0:5:44,74 --> 0:5:45,6
DAN MALLOY: Yeah.


130
0:5:45,6 --> 0:5:48,48
I took that one to Sri Lanka
and surfed it a ton.


131
0:5:48,48 --> 0:5:52,2
That one was shaped for
Kelly, and I still


132
0:5:52,2 --> 0:5:53,4
have to give it back.


133
0:5:53,4 --> 0:5:57,2
He totally knows that I
have it still, and I


134
0:5:57,2 --> 0:5:57,82
need to give it back.


135
0:5:57,82 --> 0:6:1,16
But there's a big ethical
dispute in surfing, whether


136
0:6:1,16 --> 0:6:6,32
you should use jet skis or not
to get into waves, and I kind


137
0:6:6,32 --> 0:6:9,45
of agree with all the
anti-jet ski talk.


138
0:6:9,45 --> 0:6:12,81
But then every once in while,
you can get in a situation


139
0:6:12,81 --> 0:6:14,53
that would be impossible
to get in.


140
0:6:14,53 --> 0:6:18,83
Part of it's just it's loud and
smells like gas, and when


141
0:6:18,83 --> 0:6:23,61
you get a good wave, you don't
feel like the accomplishment--


142
0:6:23,61 --> 0:6:25,28
I don't know.


143
0:6:25,28 --> 0:6:26,82
It's almost just a different
experience.


144
0:6:26,82 --> 0:6:31,4
And on big days, you'll catch
maybe 30 or 40 waves on it


145
0:6:31,4 --> 0:6:34,1
with a jet ski, and if you're
paddling you might only catch


146
0:6:34,1 --> 0:6:35,31
three or four.


147
0:6:35,31 --> 0:6:39,6
But it's like that whole
quantity and quality thing.


148
0:6:39,6 --> 0:6:42,45
Those four waves and that whole
experience are super


149
0:6:42,45 --> 0:6:44,8
quiet and nice and with
a couple friends.


150
0:6:44,8 --> 0:6:49,19
And you don't feel as safe,
but that can feel OK, too.


151
0:6:49,19 --> 0:6:50,89
TYLER MANSON: This is?


152
0:6:50,89 --> 0:6:52,94
DAN MALLOY: Kind of the
latest version of--


153
0:6:52,94 --> 0:6:56,3
Danny Hess and I have been
working on some boards.


154
0:6:56,3 --> 0:6:58,196
Or he's been working on them,
and I've been getting to ride


155
0:6:58,196 --> 0:7:1,28
them, I guess is how
it should be put.


156
0:7:1,28 --> 0:7:3,5
Actually, what I've been riding
the most around here in


157
0:7:3,5 --> 0:7:8,32
the summertime, as far as
shortboards go, are these.


158
0:7:8,32 --> 0:7:10,23
Fletch is also my neighbor.


159
0:7:10,23 --> 0:7:12,29
He lives about four houses up.


160
0:7:12,29 --> 0:7:16,2
He's been shaping me boards for
about three years now, and


161
0:7:16,2 --> 0:7:18,19
this is a model we've been
working on a ton.


162
0:7:18,19 --> 0:7:20,0
And it's coming out
pretty good.


163
0:7:20,0 --> 0:7:21,595
This board is the best
shortboard that


164
0:7:21,595 --> 0:7:23,26
I have right now.


165
0:7:23,26 --> 0:7:27,7
But my dad made about
10 or 12 of these.


166
0:7:27,7 --> 0:7:30,71
They're replicas of the boards
that they use to make and ride


167
0:7:30,71 --> 0:7:32,67
in the '20s or around
that era.


168
0:7:32,67 --> 0:7:36,4
I guess it was from the early
1900s to, maybe, the '30s they


169
0:7:36,4 --> 0:7:38,83
were still around,
I'm guessing.


170
0:7:38,83 --> 0:7:43,22
And they're a replica of the
Tom Blake-style paddle


171
0:7:43,22 --> 0:7:46,18
surfboards.


172
0:7:46,18 --> 0:7:47,6
You got it?


173
0:7:47,6 --> 0:7:48,45
TYLER MANSON: Yeah.


174
0:7:48,45 --> 0:7:48,49
DAN MALLOY: OK.


175
0:7:48,49 --> 0:7:50,6
And it fills up with
water pretty quick.


176
0:7:50,6 --> 0:7:52,52
Oh, I don't know if
there's a cork.


177
0:7:52,52 --> 0:7:57,88
But I think a wine cork fits
in there, so let's see.


178
0:7:57,88 --> 0:7:59,13
This is Tom Blake.


179
0:7:59,13 --> 0:8:2,28



180
0:8:2,28 --> 0:8:6,97
Tom Blake was just this crazy
innovator, one of the people


181
0:8:6,97 --> 0:8:9,92
who set the standard for
the surfing lifestyle.


182
0:8:9,92 --> 0:8:13,15
He was this kind of crazy,
eccentric guy who--


183
0:8:13,15 --> 0:8:17,41
I think, vegan, vegetarian, in
Hawaii, at a time when they


184
0:8:17,41 --> 0:8:20,19
were having luaus and eating
pig and barbecuing and all


185
0:8:20,19 --> 0:8:21,32
this stuff.


186
0:8:21,32 --> 0:8:25,6
He lived in a little tiny boat
by himself and was one of the


187
0:8:25,6 --> 0:8:28,5
first people to go, let's make
the boards really, really


188
0:8:28,5 --> 0:8:30,73
light and, through a bunch of
different experiments, came up


189
0:8:30,73 --> 0:8:32,38
with these hollow,
wooden boards.


190
0:8:32,38 --> 0:8:34,659
And all of the sudden, they were
these amazing tools for


191
0:8:34,659 --> 0:8:37,37
life guarding and surfing.


192
0:8:37,37 --> 0:8:38,2
Everything was better.


193
0:8:38,2 --> 0:8:41,13
And then one day, he put a fin
on the back to see if it would


194
0:8:41,13 --> 0:8:42,799
help him steer a little
bit better.


195
0:8:42,799 --> 0:8:46,4
And that was probably the most
important innovation.


196
0:8:46,4 --> 0:8:50,1
All of the sudden, you could
completely control the board


197
0:8:50,1 --> 0:8:54,56
and go down the line, which was
totally setting everyone


198
0:8:54,56 --> 0:8:55,54
up to get barreled.

DAN MALLOY: I was riding a 7'
2" Greg Liddle about a week


202
0:9:24,98 --> 0:9:26,18
ago or something like that.


203
0:9:26,18 --> 0:9:28,12
I was just not that much
in the mood to surf.


204
0:9:28,12 --> 0:9:33,46
And those boards paddle well
and are easy to carry, so I


205
0:9:33,46 --> 0:9:34,35
just grabbed it.


206
0:9:34,35 --> 0:9:36,4
It didn't have a fin in it, but
I was just going to go on


207
0:9:36,4 --> 0:9:38,63
my stomach or maybe go on
my knees or something.


208
0:9:38,63 --> 0:9:39,73
I just wanted to get
in the water.


209
0:9:39,73 --> 0:9:42,315
And I got a couple waves and
stood up, and it felt like it


210
0:9:42,315 --> 0:9:43,64
was really going fast.


211
0:9:43,64 --> 0:9:45,74
Even though it didn't have a
fin, the way that it's shaped,


212
0:9:45,74 --> 0:9:47,31
you could really still
go down the line.


213
0:9:47,31 --> 0:9:51,4
So I got all psyched, and it's
the board I've been riding in


214
0:9:51,4 --> 0:9:52,7
the last few days.


215
0:9:52,7 --> 0:9:54,22
Or I've had about four sessions
now without a fin,


216
0:9:54,22 --> 0:9:56,42
and I'm totally having
fun with it.


217
0:9:56,42 --> 0:9:59,84
You've got to concentrate
super-hard and totally focus.


218
0:9:59,84 --> 0:10:2,74
In littler waves like that, you
don't usually have to pay


219
0:10:2,74 --> 0:10:3,49
that much attention.


220
0:10:3,49 --> 0:10:6,23
So on days like today, it's
kind of soft and you can


221
0:10:6,23 --> 0:10:7,98
experiment with different
stuff.


222
0:10:7,98 --> 0:10:9,15
Usually, that's what
makes it fun.


223
0:10:9,15 --> 0:10:12,83
If you go out on board you're
super used to, it can be a


224
0:10:12,83 --> 0:10:13,56
little bit boring.


225
0:10:13,56 --> 0:10:13,875
[LAUGHS].


226
0:10:13,875 --> 0:10:14,49
It depends.
