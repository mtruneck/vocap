MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: We have
a big fire behind us.


5
0:0:19,31 --> 0:0:21,79
There's going to be an even
bigger fire at 12 o'clock.


6
0:0:21,79 --> 0:0:23,4
And we're doing it
for a reason.


7
0:0:23,4 --> 0:0:38,91



8
0:0:38,91 --> 0:0:41,88
This is Belfast, capital city of
Northern Ireland, and long


9
0:0:41,88 --> 0:0:44,335
considered the European
capital of terrorism.


10
0:0:44,335 --> 0:0:47,21
To outsiders, it's a city
defined by the centuries-long


11
0:0:47,21 --> 0:0:50,24
conflict between Catholics and
Protestants, which, reduced to


12
0:0:50,24 --> 0:0:52,67
its simplest parts, pits
nationalist Catholics


13
0:0:52,67 --> 0:0:55,58
demanding unity with Republic
of Ireland against unionist


14
0:0:55,58 --> 0:0:58,46
Protestants who want to remain
part of the United Kingdom.


15
0:0:58,46 --> 0:1:1,66
In 1969, the modern version of
the Troubles, as the conflict


16
0:1:1,66 --> 0:1:4,2
is locally known, kicked off
when British troops were


17
0:1:4,2 --> 0:1:6,24
dispatched to Northern Ireland
to quell a spike


18
0:1:6,24 --> 0:1:7,46
in sectarian violence.


19
0:1:7,46 --> 0:1:10,67
It would turn into a 30 year
troop deployment, a violent


20
0:1:10,67 --> 0:1:13,39
civil war that claimed
3,600 lives.


21
0:1:13,39 --> 0:1:16,28
In 1998, after years of
killings, bombings, hunger


22
0:1:16,28 --> 0:1:18,75
strikes, kneecappings, torture,
and terror, the


23
0:1:18,75 --> 0:1:21,19
political parties of Northern
Ireland and representatives of


24
0:1:21,19 --> 0:1:23,92
both Catholic and Protestant
paramilitary groups signed the


25
0:1:23,92 --> 0:1:25,35
Good Friday Agreement.


26
0:1:25,35 --> 0:1:27,79
Weapons were decommissioned,
paramilitary prisoners were


27
0:1:27,79 --> 0:1:29,83
released, and peace
came to Ulster.


28
0:1:29,83 --> 0:1:31,97
But it's been a tenuous,
brittle peace.


29
0:1:31,97 --> 0:1:33,52
We went to Northern Ireland
during the height of the


30
0:1:33,52 --> 0:1:36,25
marching season, when unionists
bang their drums and


31
0:1:36,25 --> 0:1:38,86
celebrate a centuries-old
Protestant military victory


32
0:1:38,86 --> 0:1:40,17
over a Catholic king.


33
0:1:40,17 --> 0:1:42,69
Tensions were high and, we soon
discovered, while the war


34
0:1:42,69 --> 0:1:44,745
may have ended, the conflict
is far from over.

0:1:52,32 --> 0:2:29,84



38
0:2:29,84 --> 0:2:31,15
MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: Our guide to
the Catholic side of the


39
0:2:31,15 --> 0:2:34,69
conflict was Gerry Foster, a
former member of the INLA, a


40
0:2:34,69 --> 0:2:36,81
Catholic paramilitary group
that's a lot like the


41
0:2:36,81 --> 0:2:39,83
better-known IRA, but with more
references to socialism


42
0:2:39,83 --> 0:2:40,93
and Che Guevara.


43
0:2:40,93 --> 0:2:43,67
GERRY FOSTER: I was in prison
for a [INAUDIBLE] bomb,


44
0:2:43,67 --> 0:2:46,15
attacked [INAUDIBLE] party
headquarters, which would have


45
0:2:46,15 --> 0:2:50,225
been the biggest pro-British
party in Ireland at that time.


46
0:2:50,225 --> 0:2:52,375
And their leadership was
having a meeting.


47
0:2:52,375 --> 0:2:53,49
And [INAUDIBLE]


48
0:2:53,49 --> 0:2:55,77
a young lad and planted
a bomb.


49
0:2:55,77 --> 0:2:59,42
The intention was to wipe them
out, to kill them all.


50
0:2:59,42 --> 0:3:1,95
The bomb did go off and did
destroy the building.


51
0:3:1,95 --> 0:3:4,782
But the British were able
to get out of the


52
0:3:4,782 --> 0:3:5,88
building just before--


53
0:3:5,88 --> 0:3:8,545
no one was hurt-- just before
the bomb went off.


54
0:3:8,545 --> 0:3:11,285
There was a feeling
of disappointment.


55
0:3:11,285 --> 0:3:13,83
And now that sounds a bit mad
now-- looking back and you


56
0:3:13,83 --> 0:3:15,51
were disappointed that people
weren't killed.


57
0:3:15,51 --> 0:3:17,73
But I'm talking about how
I felt at that time.


58
0:3:17,73 --> 0:3:21,31
I had that naivete that if we
got rid of the British, the


59
0:3:21,31 --> 0:3:22,46
world would be great.


60
0:3:22,46 --> 0:3:24,81
MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: This guy with
Gerry is Alistair Little.


61
0:3:24,81 --> 0:3:27,26
Alistair joined the Ulster
Volunteer Force, a Protestant


62
0:3:27,26 --> 0:3:29,39
paramilitary organization,
before he was


63
0:3:29,39 --> 0:3:30,84
old enough to drive.


64
0:3:30,84 --> 0:3:33,9
He was convicted of murder
and spent 13 years in the


65
0:3:33,9 --> 0:3:35,46
notorious H-block of
the Maze Prison.


66
0:3:35,46 --> 0:3:37,97
Upon his release, Alastair,
repentant for the crimes he


67
0:3:37,97 --> 0:3:40,93
committed, teamed up with Gerry,
his former enemy, and


68
0:3:40,93 --> 0:3:42,73
dedicated himself to peace
work between the two


69
0:3:42,73 --> 0:3:43,37
communities.


70
0:3:43,37 --> 0:3:45,33
ALISTAIR LITTLE: When I was a
paramilitary, I didn't care.


71
0:3:45,33 --> 0:3:46,48
I would have done anything.


72
0:3:46,48 --> 0:3:49,15
I'm on record, and it's been
published where I would have


73
0:3:49,15 --> 0:3:53,305
wanted to go onto a bus and take
all the Protestants off


74
0:3:53,305 --> 0:3:54,555
it and kill everybody on.


75
0:3:54,555 --> 0:3:57,46



76
0:3:57,46 --> 0:3:59,62
MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: So when
you went to jail, it


77
0:3:59,62 --> 0:4:2,18
was for dong what?


78
0:4:2,18 --> 0:4:3,435
For shooting somebody, right?


79
0:4:3,435 --> 0:4:4,99
ALISTAIR LITTLE: Yeah, There's
a number of charges.


80
0:4:4,99 --> 0:4:10,1
But the main charge was going
into a house of a a Catholic


81
0:4:10,1 --> 0:4:12,396
nationalist gang, shooting
them dead.


82
0:4:12,396 --> 0:4:15,8



83
0:4:15,8 --> 0:4:16,64
MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: In Belfast,
Protestant and Catholic


84
0:4:16,64 --> 0:4:19,4
communities zigzag across
the landscape, often


85
0:4:19,4 --> 0:4:20,48
abutting each other.


86
0:4:20,48 --> 0:4:22,88
If the political murals and
flags don't provide enough of


87
0:4:22,88 --> 0:4:25,48
a guide to neighborhood divides,
the confused visitor


88
0:4:25,48 --> 0:4:28,46
can simply follow the peace
walls, unsightly physical


89
0:4:28,46 --> 0:4:31,3
barriers that, 13 years after
the Good Friday Agreement,


90
0:4:31,3 --> 0:4:34,52
still separate communities
by religion.


91
0:4:34,52 --> 0:4:37,37
ALISTAIR LITTLE: There's more
peace walls exist today than


92
0:4:37,37 --> 0:4:39,1
there was during the conflict.


93
0:4:39,1 --> 0:4:42,53
In the whole of Northern
Ireland, there's over 80 walls


94
0:4:42,53 --> 0:4:45,78
and gates that separate
communities.


95
0:4:45,78 --> 0:4:47,87
GERRY FOSTER: So the gates are
closed, because once it starts


96
0:4:47,87 --> 0:4:49,357
for young people, it
only escalates and


97
0:4:49,357 --> 0:4:50,31
gets worse and worse.


98
0:4:50,31 --> 0:4:52,854
So it's easier now just to
close the gates at night,


99
0:4:52,854 --> 0:4:53,738
leave it at that.


100
0:4:53,738 --> 0:4:54,74
MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: And
they do close them?


101
0:4:54,74 --> 0:4:54,96
GERRY FOSTER: Yeah.


102
0:4:54,96 --> 0:4:56,6
MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: Yeah.


103
0:4:56,6 --> 0:4:59,35
I mean, these are
really enormous.


104
0:4:59,35 --> 0:5:1,69
Are they to prevent people
from hurling things over?


105
0:5:1,69 --> 0:5:2,36
Petrol bombs?


106
0:5:2,36 --> 0:5:2,844
ALISTAIR LITTLE: Yeah.


107
0:5:2,844 --> 0:5:4,78
They increased the height
of that because


108
0:5:4,78 --> 0:5:5,748
they were still throwing.


109
0:5:5,748 --> 0:5:7,69
GERRY FOSTER: Still throwing.


110
0:5:7,69 --> 0:5:10,65
GERRY FOSTER: Because the past
hasn't really been dealt with


111
0:5:10,65 --> 0:5:14,17
politically, there's still
tensions, there's still fears,


112
0:5:14,17 --> 0:5:15,42
there's still suspicions.


113
0:5:15,42 --> 0:5:23,9



114
0:5:23,9 --> 0:5:24,85
MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: What's the
kind of mix now between those


115
0:5:24,85 --> 0:5:25,77
two communities?


116
0:5:25,77 --> 0:5:27,59
What is the level of
interaction, whether it's


117
0:5:27,59 --> 0:5:30,17
people dating one
another, kids--


118
0:5:30,17 --> 0:5:31,77
do they see the divide
the way that you guys


119
0:5:31,77 --> 0:5:33,69
did 20 years ago?


120
0:5:33,69 --> 0:5:36,45
ALISTAIR LITTLE: In Belfast,
in the city center, there


121
0:5:36,45 --> 0:5:39,49
would be more of that now
happening among students or


122
0:5:39,49 --> 0:5:42,75
through peace work that's been
done through community groups.


123
0:5:42,75 --> 0:5:46,21
In the housing estate that I
grew up in, in the early years


124
0:5:46,21 --> 0:5:50,78
of the conflict, if a girl had
been going with a Catholic,


125
0:5:50,78 --> 0:5:53,2
they might have been tied to
a lamp post and their heads


126
0:5:53,2 --> 0:5:54,83
sheared or a placard
put around there--


127
0:5:54,83 --> 0:5:55,75
MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: Has that
actually happened?


128
0:5:55,75 --> 0:5:56,88
ALISTAIR LITTLE: Yeah.


129
0:5:56,88 --> 0:5:58,46
MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: That's
like Nazi Germany shit.


130
0:5:58,46 --> 0:5:59,91
ALISTAIR LITTLE: Well,
especially in Belfast--


131
0:5:59,91 --> 0:6:0,98
MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: Shaving
heads and--


132
0:6:0,98 --> 0:6:4,84
ALISTAIR LITTLE: If you'd have
got a Republican girl or a


133
0:6:4,84 --> 0:6:8,5
nationalist girl going with a
soldier, they would have been


134
0:6:8,5 --> 0:6:9,49
tarred and feathered.


135
0:6:9,49 --> 0:6:11,79
So they would have had
tar poured over them.


136
0:6:11,79 --> 0:6:12,58
MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: Let's
be clear about is.


137
0:6:12,58 --> 0:6:13,97
That's not a metaphorical
thing.


138
0:6:13,97 --> 0:6:15,57
You mean literally tarred
and feathered?


139
0:6:15,57 --> 0:6:16,27
ALISTAIR LITTLE: Yeah.


140
0:6:16,27 --> 0:6:17,432
MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: And
that's happened?


141
0:6:17,432 --> 0:6:17,82
GERRY FOSTER: Yeah.


142
0:6:17,82 --> 0:6:20,635
ALISTAIR LITTLE: Yeah.


143
0:6:20,635 --> 0:6:22,72
MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: In a small
loyalist enclave nestled


144
0:6:22,72 --> 0:6:25,51
between Catholic neighborhoods
and the Falls Road, we came


145
0:6:25,51 --> 0:6:28,3
across a throng of kids stacking
pallets for the


146
0:6:28,3 --> 0:6:30,85
evening's pre-July 12 bonfire.


147
0:6:30,85 --> 0:6:33,77
Identifying himself as a former
UVF prisoner, Alistair


148
0:6:33,77 --> 0:6:36,33
negotiated our entry
into the area.


149
0:6:36,33 --> 0:6:38,445
ALISTAIR LITTLE: It's a
commemoration of the Battle of


150
0:6:38,445 --> 0:6:44,9
the Boyne in 1690, King William
defeating King James.


151
0:6:44,9 --> 0:6:48,75
So they would have lit beacons
all along the way to send a


152
0:6:48,75 --> 0:6:51,3
message, which was just
a celebration of that.


153
0:6:51,3 --> 0:6:54,99
It's also very symbolic
in terms of identity.


154
0:6:54,99 --> 0:6:58,32
Notice, you can see the flags
that they're burning as the


155
0:6:58,32 --> 0:7:2,5
flags of the Republic of
Ireland, which is seen as the


156
0:7:2,5 --> 0:7:3,3
enemy or foreign state.


157
0:7:3,3 --> 0:7:5,89



158
0:7:5,89 --> 0:7:6,73
MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: You guys
aren't going to burn


159
0:7:6,73 --> 0:7:8,5
that one, are you?


160
0:7:8,5 --> 0:7:9,3
MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: You're going
to burn that one, right?


161
0:7:9,3 --> 0:7:11,87



162
0:7:11,87 --> 0:7:13,12
MICHAEL MOYNIHAN:
Who's this guy?


163
0:7:13,12 --> 0:7:15,36



164
0:7:15,36 --> 0:7:17,22
MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: What's
on his head?


165
0:7:17,22 --> 0:7:18,8
MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: Yeah?


166
0:7:18,8 --> 0:7:20,98
Why does he have a penis
on his head?


167
0:7:20,98 --> 0:7:22,23
MICHAEL MOYNIHAN:
He's a wank dog.


168
0:7:22,23 --> 0:7:24,806



169
0:7:24,806 --> 0:7:26,832
MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: Fuck a Pope.


170
0:7:26,832 --> 0:7:28,918
Fuck a Pope?


171
0:7:28,918 --> 0:7:30,168
You don't like the Pope?


172
0:7:30,168 --> 0:7:33,64



173
0:7:33,64 --> 0:7:34,491
MICHAEL MOYNIHAN:
Pope's a dick.


174
0:7:34,491 --> 0:7:35,333
All right.


175
0:7:35,333 --> 0:7:36,6
There we go.


176
0:7:36,6 --> 0:7:39,385
For all the Americans out there,
what's the celebration?


177
0:7:39,385 --> 0:7:40,635
Explain it to them.


178
0:7:40,635 --> 0:7:47,56



179
0:7:47,56 --> 0:7:50,39
MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: The kids
over here are sort of


180
0:7:50,39 --> 0:7:52,14
impregnated with all
these phrases.


181
0:7:52,14 --> 0:7:54,44
When you ask them a little more
about them, they don't


182
0:7:54,44 --> 0:7:55,85
seem to know what they're
talking about.


183
0:7:55,85 --> 0:7:58,62
But they do hate the IRA.


184
0:7:58,62 --> 0:7:59,76
They hate Fenians.


185
0:7:59,76 --> 0:8:1,1
One kid said, don't
use "Fenian,"


186
0:8:1,1 --> 0:8:2,21
because it's too nice.


187
0:8:2,21 --> 0:8:3,3
Call them Taigs.


188
0:8:3,3 --> 0:8:6,39
And they really, really cannot
stand Catholics.


189
0:8:6,39 --> 0:8:9,35
And the strange thing about it
is on every side that you see


190
0:8:9,35 --> 0:8:11,56
here, and even right behind
us, are Catholic


191
0:8:11,56 --> 0:8:12,8
neighborhoods.


192
0:8:12,8 --> 0:8:14,76
And they have a sort of
weird siege mentality.


193
0:8:14,76 --> 0:8:17,64
They said people throw petrol
bombs, people throw rocks into


194
0:8:17,64 --> 0:8:18,4
the estate.


195
0:8:18,4 --> 0:8:20,5
So I suppose it's a bit
understandable.


196
0:8:20,5 --> 0:8:23,17



197
0:8:23,17 --> 0:8:26,42
ALISTAIR LITTLE: One of the
difficulties a lot of people


198
0:8:26,42 --> 0:8:29,13
involved in peace work
would encounter--


199
0:8:29,13 --> 0:8:31,29
and many don't understand--


200
0:8:31,29 --> 0:8:33,284
is that they ask young people to
do things that they're not


201
0:8:33,284 --> 0:8:34,484
prepared to do themselves.


202
0:8:34,484 --> 0:8:39,869
If the conflict gives them a
sense of importance, and if it


203
0:8:39,869 --> 0:8:42,36
seems significant as a young
person, if there's a sense of


204
0:8:42,36 --> 0:8:45,1
belonging with each other
because they're involved in


205
0:8:45,1 --> 0:8:48,9
something special, if they
believe that they're standing


206
0:8:48,9 --> 0:8:50,81
up for the community--


207
0:8:50,81 --> 0:8:55,53
all of those things give them
such a sense of identity.


208
0:8:55,53 --> 0:8:58,18

give all that up, there's no


209
0:8:58,18 --> 0:8:59,38
adult would give that up.
