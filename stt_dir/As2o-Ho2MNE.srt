1
0:0:8,9 --> 0:0:14,11
Why did you want to be an astronaut?


2
0:0:14,11 --> 0:0:21,34
In the late ’60s I was seven, eight, nine
years old, and what was going on in the news


3
0:0:21,34 --> 0:0:26,85
at that time that really excited a seven,
eight, nine year old boy was the Space Race.


4
0:0:26,85 --> 0:0:32,44
The “2001: A Space Odyssey,” that science
fiction movie came out, and in reality people


5
0:0:32,44 --> 0:0:37,51
were flying Gemini and people were starting
to fly Apollo and starting to go to the moon,


6
0:0:37,51 --> 0:0:41,989
and the whole purpose of it, which was clear
to everybody, was to put a human being on


7
0:0:41,989 --> 0:0:46,37
the moon by the end of decade. Within the
’60s, and so as a kid growing up, it didn’t


8
0:0:46,37 --> 0:0:51,969
matter where you were, whether you were in
Malaysia or Canada or here in Houston, this


9
0:0:51,969 --> 0:0:56,2
is a pretty exciting thing, and it really
captured my imagination. I had a National


10
0:0:56,2 --> 0:1:2,48
Geographic big picture of the moon above my
bed on the wall and I was watching the exploits.


11
0:1:2,48 --> 0:1:9,1
On July 20, 1969, like so many other people,
I sat and looked at a bad, grainy little television


12
0:1:9,1 --> 0:1:13,869
and watched those first steps on the moon
and then went outside with my family, but


13
0:1:13,869 --> 0:1:20,63
really alone, looked up at the moon and thought,
that’s what I want to do when I grow up;


14
0:1:20,63 --> 0:1:25,36
I’m going to grow up to be something, why
don’t I grow up to be that, that is an interesting


15
0:1:25,36 --> 0:1:30,979
thing, that’s a new challenge for humanity.
But then when I look around I’m thinking,


16
0:1:30,979 --> 0:1:35,95
I’m a nine year old kid and I’m a Canadian,
what are my odds? Not very good. But I thought,


17
0:1:35,95 --> 0:1:39,459
well, up until yesterday people couldn’t
even go and walk on the moon and now they


18
0:1:39,459 --> 0:1:48,149
can, so maybe I can, too. I started getting
ready that night, what do I need to do next?


19
0:1:48,149 --> 0:1:54,63
And I need to learn to fly and to scuba dive
and to stay in shape and other languages and


20
0:1:54,63 --> 0:1:59,759
study in university and all of those things.
To become an engineer, a fighter pilot, a


21
0:1:59,759 --> 0:2:5,39
test pilot and all of that, which was fun
and fascinating, but also all to help maybe


22
0:2:5,39 --> 0:2:9,59
in the lifelong dream of having a chance to
be an astronaut and to follow in the footsteps


23
0:2:9,59 --> 0:2:15,63
of Buzz and Neil. Amazingly enough it worked.


24
0:2:15,63 --> 0:2:21,68
Tell me a little of that story. Tell me about
where you grew up.


25
0:2:21,68 --> 0:2:27,969
I was born in Sarnia, Ontario; a small town,
it’s where oil was pretty much discovered


26
0:2:27,969 --> 0:2:34,7
in North America. It’s an industrial town
right on the Great Lakes, beautiful little


27
0:2:34,7 --> 0:2:39,84
spot, and my father got hired by an airline
when I was about seven or eight and then we


28
0:2:39,84 --> 0:2:43,849
moved to a farm closer to Toronto because
he was flying for Air Canada based out of


29
0:2:43,849 --> 0:2:48,849
Toronto. I spent my childhood basically in
two towns, Sarnia for the first half of it,


30
0:2:48,849 --> 0:2:53,65
starting kindergarten and grade school there,
and then Milton, Ontario, near Toronto, living


31
0:2:53,65 --> 0:2:59,799
on a farm for the rest of middle school and
for high school. My parents still live on


32
0:2:59,799 --> 0:3:3,15
a farm near Milton, Ontario.


33
0:3:3,15 --> 0:3:9,4
How did that place and those people help make
you the person that you are?


34
0:3:9,4 --> 0:3:16,76
I’ve raised three kids, my wife and I have
three kids. I’ve observed through direct


35
0:3:16,76 --> 0:3:23,6
contact the adults they are now is partially
the product of where they came from and what


36
0:3:23,6 --> 0:3:27,93
we did. With them growing up, but partially
how they were wired at birth. There are fundamental


37
0:3:27,93 --> 0:3:35,53
differences, and I’m sure I’m no different
than my kids. I am born with whatever I was


38
0:3:35,53 --> 0:3:39,7
born with, what height I’m going to be and
what color my eyes are and how my particular


39
0:3:39,7 --> 0:3:47,709
synapses all fire, but I’m also very much
the product of the environment; my value system,


40
0:3:47,709 --> 0:3:51,459
the educational system that I went through,
the people that I met, the people that inspired


41
0:3:51,459 --> 0:3:59,34
me or the people that oppressed me. I’m
very much a product of all of that. So any


42
0:3:59,34 --> 0:4:4,84
successes I’ve had, partially it’s due
to genetics, partially it’s due to the people


43
0:4:4,84 --> 0:4:9,799
that have trained me and taught me and shaped
me over the years, and I have lots of people


44
0:4:9,799 --> 0:4:15,79
that I could directly thank for helping get
me to where I am today. For teaching me something


45
0:4:15,79 --> 0:4:21,19
critical or maybe teaching me something in
general that helped me perceive things the


46
0:4:21,19 --> 0:4:28,539
way that I do. I think, if you want to grow
up to be an astronaut, growing up as a kid


47
0:4:28,539 --> 0:4:31,37
in southern Ontario is a pretty good place
to come from.


48
0:4:31,37 --> 0:4:36,139
Pick up the story from there for me and give
me a thumbnail sketch of big steps in your


49
0:4:36,139 --> 0:4:42,65
education and your career that have led you
to be here at this point.


50
0:4:42,65 --> 0:4:51,71
I went to a little tiny rural school called
Percy W. Merry. I was doing well in school;


51
0:4:51,71 --> 0:4:57,139
I was in grade three or four and skipped one
of those grades. Fortunately the Ontario educational


52
0:4:57,139 --> 0:5:2,819
system in the province of Ontario in Canada,
had decided that they should have, what at


53
0:5:2,819 --> 0:5:5,74
the time they called “enrichment,” sort
of like trying to pick out the kids that were


54
0:5:5,74 --> 0:5:10,46
doing real well, how to challenge them, and
how to maybe put them in a different educational


55
0:5:10,46 --> 0:5:15,12
environment so that they could really learn
and be challenged. I got into that program


56
0:5:15,12 --> 0:5:20,3
and for three years I was in an enrichment
program, really teaching us to think more


57
0:5:20,3 --> 0:5:25,539
critically, more analytically, think on a
different scale then just getting these exercises


58
0:5:25,539 --> 0:5:32,16
done in time for this test. I went to two
different high schools, and there was two


59
0:5:32,16 --> 0:5:36,47
different tracks, one the high school track
to go to the university and one not. At the


60
0:5:36,47 --> 0:5:40,419
time you went to an extra year of high school
if you’re going to university, nice preparation


61
0:5:40,419 --> 0:5:48,259
for the course that I decided to follow. I
was a ski instructor; there’s a great opportunity


62
0:5:48,259 --> 0:5:57,43
for outdoor activities in Canada and to be
able to have the combination of the natural


63
0:5:57,43 --> 0:6:1,72
environment, the physical challenges of downhill
skiing and racing. Being a ski instructor,


64
0:6:1,72 --> 0:6:7,22
for me I learned a lot about managing speed
and managing energy. I learned to fly as a


65
0:6:7,22 --> 0:6:11,61
teenager; there’s a program in Canada called
Air Cadets, it’s sort of like the Civil


66
0:6:11,61 --> 0:6:16,5
Air Patrol in the United States but it’s
a little closer to the Canadian air force,


67
0:6:16,5 --> 0:6:21,25
and they teach young Canadians, whether it’s
Sea Cadets, Army Cadets or Air Cadets, they


68
0:6:21,25 --> 0:6:24,569
teach them a bunch of technical things, they
teach them self-discipline, they give them


69
0:6:24,569 --> 0:6:28,75
levels of responsibility that they might not
get otherwise as teenagers, and in my case,


70
0:6:28,75 --> 0:6:32,819
I spent one summer learning to be a glider
pilot and getting my glider pilot’s license.


71
0:6:32,819 --> 0:6:39,39
Right at the age of 16 I became a powered
pilot. A significant percentage of commercial


72
0:6:39,39 --> 0:6:43,71
pilots in Canada, something like half of them,
went through Air Cadets, so it’s a great


73
0:6:43,71 --> 0:6:48,979
program set up by the country that allows
young Canadians to pursue an area of specialized


74
0:6:48,979 --> 0:6:54,229
interest that then makes them useful to the
country later on. Then I went to our military


75
0:6:54,229 --> 0:6:58,949
academies, which in our case was called Royal
Roads Military College and then the Royal


76
0:6:58,949 --> 0:7:6,75
Military College of Canada, RMC, studying
engineering. If you’re going to get into


77
0:7:6,75 --> 0:7:10,189
the air force or any phase of the military
you have two different ways, you can come


78
0:7:10,189 --> 0:7:15,629
in directly or you can come through the military
college system and I chose, I figured, well,


79
0:7:15,629 --> 0:7:20,74
the odds of being an astronaut are pretty
lousy and I need something else as a real


80
0:7:20,74 --> 0:7:25,69
career, and so I decided I want to study engineering
and then maybe I’ll be able to be a pilot,


81
0:7:25,69 --> 0:7:29,5
and then maybe I’ll be able to be a pilot
as my profession for my whole life. Maybe


82
0:7:29,5 --> 0:7:34,479
I’ll get to be an astronaut, and fortunately,
all of those things worked out, but I would


83
0:7:34,479 --> 0:7:39,77
have been happy at each one of those stages
as I worked my way through. When I came out


84
0:7:39,77 --> 0:7:44,9
of military college I was lucky enough to
be able to do a, master’s work, graduate


85
0:7:44,9 --> 0:7:49,5
level work. Then go on to fly and be able
to fly Canada’s new fighter at the time


86
0:7:49,5 --> 0:7:54,34
which is our version of the F-18, we called
it the CF-18. I flew those for NORAD [North


87
0:7:54,34 --> 0:7:57,75
American Aerospace Defense Command], then
I did exchange to the U.S. Air Force Test


88
0:7:57,75 --> 0:8:3,55
Pilot School, and then flew as an exchange
pilot, a Canadian flying F-18s with the U.S.


89
0:8:3,55 --> 0:8:10,5
Navy in Patuxent River. So that long, convoluted
flow from an advanced education program as


90
0:8:10,5 --> 0:8:17,4
a ten year old kid or eleven year old kid
in the enrichment program in elementary/middle


91
0:8:17,4 --> 0:8:23,46
school in Canada, all the way through to getting
selected as an astronaut. I see myself very


92
0:8:23,46 --> 0:8:30,58
much a product of all of those structures
and capabilities that Canada provided me.


93
0:8:30,58 --> 0:8:36,479
To fly as an astronaut is to assume some risks
that most people don’t have in their lives;


94
0:8:36,479 --> 0:8:44,89
question is, what is it you feel that we get
or learn as a result of flying people in space


95
0:8:44,89 --> 0:8:50,98
that makes it worth taking the risk?


96
0:8:50,98 --> 0:8:54,35
Almost everything worthwhile carries with
it some sort of risk, whether it’s starting


97
0:8:54,35 --> 0:9:2,75
a new business, whether it’s leaving home,
whether it’s getting married, or whether


98
0:9:2,75 --> 0:9:8,7
it’s flying in space. You are taking a risk:
you are going from one known set of circumstances


99
0:9:8,7 --> 0:9:14,6
into a new set of circumstances, and everybody
takes some of those risks during their life.


100
0:9:14,6 --> 0:9:21,9
It’s a natural progression of maturity,
of the desire to do something with yourself,


101
0:9:21,9 --> 0:9:28,54
the desire to have a measure of success and
increased capability and increased comfort


102
0:9:28,54 --> 0:9:34,92
in your life. Also maybe the desire to be
able to look back at your life and say, I


103
0:9:34,92 --> 0:9:40,2
did something worthwhile in the time that
I was alive. That manifests itself all different


104
0:9:40,2 --> 0:9:46,47
ways in human behavior. People try and answer
those questions to themselves doing all different


105
0:9:46,47 --> 0:9:51,98
sorts of things. I made the choice early on
what I thought was important was technical;


106
0:9:51,98 --> 0:9:56,66
I think it’s important to push back the
level of what we can do technically, and I


107
0:9:56,66 --> 0:10:3,29
chose aerospace, and as a fighter pilot, I
helped defend North America by using the latest


108
0:10:3,29 --> 0:10:8,3
of aerospace technology, but that wasn’t
where I wanted to end up. I wanted to then


109
0:10:8,3 --> 0:10:14,87
get into aircraft design and testing and try
and make airplanes safer, make airplanes more


110
0:10:14,87 --> 0:10:23,7
capable. We burnt a hydrogen-fueled engine
on the wingtip of an F-18 trying to understand


111
0:10:23,7 --> 0:10:29,8
how to build a vehicle that could get you
across the Pacific in an hour. Doing high


112
0:10:29,8 --> 0:10:33,2
angle of attack testing of F-18s, trying to
make airplanes that could fly where airplanes


113
0:10:33,2 --> 0:10:38,56
could never fly before, that was really interesting
to me, and it was risky. I lost a good friend


114
0:10:38,56 --> 0:10:44,45
a year for ten years as a fighter pilot and
a test pilot. I knew that it was risky. My


115
0:10:44,45 --> 0:10:49,23
wife knew that we go to funerals on a fairly
regular basis of people that are just doing


116
0:10:49,23 --> 0:10:56,54
their job, but you can’t make that omelet
without breaking some eggs. You cannot do


117
0:10:56,54 --> 0:11:0,64
it. You have to be able to take some risks.
Some things are worth taking a risk for. Even


118
0:11:0,64 --> 0:11:5,74
if you decide, OK, I’m going to spend my
whole life sitting at my kitchen table and


119
0:11:5,74 --> 0:11:11,13
going in between there and my bed and hiding
from risks, your house, eventually the ceiling


120
0:11:11,13 --> 0:11:16,36
falls down; there’s an earthquake, a hurricane,
a lightning storm, a tornado or whatever.


121
0:11:16,36 --> 0:11:21,19
There’s no guarantees, you may as well try
and do something worthwhile in the meanwhile


122
0:11:21,19 --> 0:11:26,76
and minimize the risks where you can. For
me, spaceflight is just a natural extension


123
0:11:26,76 --> 0:11:33,74
of all of that. For the first time in history,
if we muster all of our best of capabilities,


124
0:11:33,74 --> 0:11:39,27
we can just now safely start to leave the
Earth, to go away from our planet, and to


125
0:11:39,27 --> 0:11:46,56
be part of that, to be able to be one of the
early explorers that is opening the capability


126
0:11:46,56 --> 0:11:53,16
of leaving Earth, is fundamentally interesting
to me but I also judge it as a very worthwhile


127
0:11:53,16 --> 0:11:57,48
thing. It’s an important thing in this stage
of human development, like the first sailboats


128
0:11:57,48 --> 0:12:2,68
that left land or the first vehicles that
could drive safely and conveniently on the


129
0:12:2,68 --> 0:12:8,38
surface, or the first airplanes. We’re at
that level and I’ve wanted to be a part


130
0:12:8,38 --> 0:12:14,92
of it my whole life. I’ve devoted 20 years
as an astronaut, and now there’s risk involved.


131
0:12:14,92 --> 0:12:22,7
I’m going to fly a Russian spaceship as
the left-seater, sort of like the co-pilot


132
0:12:22,7 --> 0:12:28,2
and then live on a space station for six months
and we might die in the effort but I might


133
0:12:28,2 --> 0:12:33,2
die driving home from work tonight. I’m
going to manage things as best I can so that


134
0:12:33,2 --> 0:12:39,5
I live a long and healthy life, but a long,
healthy and worthwhile life.


135
0:12:39,5 --> 0:12:46,25
You’re about to launch to the International
Space Station for Expeditions 34 and 35. Chris,


136
0:12:46,25 --> 0:12:50,0
tell me what are the goals of this flight
and what are your jobs going to be on this


137
0:12:50,0 --> 0:12:51,85
mission?


138
0:12:51,85 --> 0:12:57,3
The space station is there for a purpose and
that is to do science that can’t be done


139
0:12:57,3 --> 0:13:2,38
on the surface of the Earth. That is the core
purpose of the space station, and so our job,


140
0:13:2,38 --> 0:13:6,8
as the people on board, is to make sure that
that science gets done. Everything else is


141
0:13:6,8 --> 0:13:12,24
sort of downstream of that. Yes, we need to
fix things as they break; sometimes we have


142
0:13:12,24 --> 0:13:18,7
to go outside on spacewalks; sometimes we
have to use the robot arm and grab a new delivery


143
0:13:18,7 --> 0:13:22,16
truck that’s full of equipment, but the
core of it is to run those hundred and ten


144
0:13:22,16 --> 0:13:27,72
experiments that are running on board, and
that’s our main job, to be the lab technicians


145
0:13:27,72 --> 0:13:31,61
as well as the plumbers and the delivery men
and all the rest of it, but really the lab


146
0:13:31,61 --> 0:13:36,6
technicians that keep the International Space
Station as the big international laboratory


147
0:13:36,6 --> 0:13:37,31
that it is.


148
0:13:37,31 --> 0:13:41,82
Now you didn’t do any of that the last time
you visited the International Space Station.


149
0:13:41,82 --> 0:13:45,64
What are you looking forward to about the
station, on this trip?


150
0:13:45,64 --> 0:13:50,5
On my first spaceflight I went to the Russian
space station, Mir and built a piece of it


151
0:13:50,5 --> 0:13:54,86
using space shuttle Atlantis. The second spaceflight
went to the international, the early, small


152
0:13:54,86 --> 0:14:0,8
International Space Station, and built a piece
of it using space shuttle Endeavour. And both


153
0:14:0,8 --> 0:14:7,74
times I thought, wow, wish I could stay; what
a desirable thing to do in life, be able to


154
0:14:7,74 --> 0:14:12,3
leave Earth and not just go build something
and come back but to leave Earth for a while,


155
0:14:12,3 --> 0:14:19,81
change your zip code for a while and really
become a resident. Both places I just felt


156
0:14:19,81 --> 0:14:26,76
so jealous of the experience as we undocked
and left. And this time after a lot of lucky


157
0:14:26,76 --> 0:14:31,39
coincidences and a lot of hard work, now I
get to be one of those crew members that stays


158
0:14:31,39 --> 0:14:38,13
for an extended period away from the planet,
and it’s been a long road getting there,


159
0:14:38,13 --> 0:14:42,28
it’s been a huge amount of qualifications
necessary to get there, a lot of luck to get


160
0:14:42,28 --> 0:14:46,67
there, but for me, it’s really a culmination
of all the things that I’ve done for the


161
0:14:46,67 --> 0:14:53,44
last 20 years as an astronaut. I’m really
looking forward to not just visiting space


162
0:14:53,44 --> 0:15:2,44
but moving to Earth orbit and having all of
the internal changes, the understanding and


163
0:15:2,44 --> 0:15:5,94
the revelation that comes with that. I’m
really looking forward to it.


164
0:15:5,94 --> 0:15:9,55
During your time there you’re going to have
a number of crewmates, some who are there


165
0:15:9,55 --> 0:15:13,24
before you, some who will arrive later, two
of them that you’re going to be with the


166
0:15:13,24 --> 0:15:17,4
whole time, and one of them, Tom Marshburn,
you’re already “flown” with, although


167
0:15:17,4 --> 0:15:20,28
it was underwater on a NEEMO [NASA Extreme
Environment Mission Operations] mission. Has


168
0:15:20,28 --> 0:15:25,31
the experience of that mission, working with
that crewmate, helped you guys prepare for


169
0:15:25,31 --> 0:15:26,95
this flight?


170
0:15:26,95 --> 0:15:31,97
I count myself hugely lucky to be flying with
a group of people, the group of humans that


171
0:15:31,97 --> 0:15:37,36
I’m flying in space with. I’ve known all
of them for a long time; Pavel Vinogradov


172
0:15:37,36 --> 0:15:42,64
and I trained together for a Mir flight back
in the early ’90s. He came over to my house,


173
0:15:42,64 --> 0:15:47,38
I gave him his first Jet Ski ride back in
about 1994, so we’ve been training together


174
0:15:47,38 --> 0:15:53,51
for a long time. Tom and I have climbed mountains
together as part of [National] Outdoor Leadership


175
0:15:53,51 --> 0:15:57,82
School, as you say, we’ve lived at the bottom
of the ocean together, and through all of


176
0:15:57,82 --> 0:16:2,5
that what’s important is shared experience.
If you’re going to take a small group of


177
0:16:2,5 --> 0:16:7,3
people and ask them to do something that is
really complicated or has really high stakes


178
0:16:7,3 --> 0:16:13,94
and potential for really complex things to
happen, then it is great to have had a shared


179
0:16:13,94 --> 0:16:19,82
experience in advance, and as deep and representative
an experience as possible. When something


180
0:16:19,82 --> 0:16:24,6
hard happens, if you can look at each other
and remember back when we saw this before,


181
0:16:24,6 --> 0:16:28,31
or remember when we were out Jet Skiing together,
or remember when we were living on the bottom


182
0:16:28,31 --> 0:16:38,1
of the ocean, that really gives you a foundation
to build upon, to rely on and a shared confidence


183
0:16:38,1 --> 0:16:44,5
in your ability to deal with the unknown.
I think the process by which we select astronauts


184
0:16:44,5 --> 0:16:48,79
and cosmonauts, the way we train together,
not just the technical training but the psychological


185
0:16:48,79 --> 0:16:54,59
and the interpersonal training that we get
is a really important and vital part of being


186
0:16:54,59 --> 0:16:56,9
successful in spaceflight.


187
0:16:56,9 --> 0:17:1,3
Any time you make a spaceflight you’re going
to miss certain things on Earth. On this flight,


188
0:17:1,3 --> 0:17:5,1
it turns out you’re going to be away for
Christmas and New Year’s. What are your


189
0:17:5,1 --> 0:17:8,449
thoughts about spending those holidays in
space?


190
0:17:8,449 --> 0:17:12,329
My family lives all around the world. I have
a son who lives in China, a son who lives


191
0:17:12,329 --> 0:17:16,939
in Germany and a daughter who lives in Ireland
and my wife is back and forth, United States


192
0:17:16,939 --> 0:17:23,559
and Canada, so really at the Christmas holiday
is when we get together. This year we’ve


193
0:17:23,559 --> 0:17:28,59
decided to bump it up a little and we’re
going to get together for Christmas in Kazakhstan.


194
0:17:28,59 --> 0:17:32,9
Makes a nice card, Christmas in Kazakhstan,
that’s where we’ll be this year. So we’re


195
0:17:32,9 --> 0:17:37,44
going to celebrate a little early. On the
actual day, the traditional day, the twenty-fifth,


196
0:17:37,44 --> 0:17:41,98
of course, it’ll be like the times when
I was working here in Houston in Mission Control


197
0:17:41,98 --> 0:17:46,71
on Christmas Day, which I did several times.
It’ll be either we’ll shift the date;


198
0:17:46,71 --> 0:17:50,72
I’ll phone in and have a video conference
or talk to each of my family members all around


199
0:17:50,72 --> 0:17:56,129
the world. It’s an understood part of the
job. This is a very special year for us as


200
0:17:56,129 --> 0:18:0,759
a family and everyone understands that it’s
not going to be normal and this’ll be a


201
0:18:0,759 --> 0:18:4,74
year, even though it’s not typical, a year
to talk about for the rest of our lives.


202
0:18:4,74 --> 0:18:9,669
I want to get you to set the scene for me.
Tell me about the International Space Station


203
0:18:9,669 --> 0:18:14,929
that you’re going to arrive at. Tell me,
what’s there now? What are the modules and


204
0:18:14,929 --> 0:18:20,759
the different facilities there that are there
to support you and your crewmates, your mission


205
0:18:20,759 --> 0:18:24,149
and yourselves?


206
0:18:24,149 --> 0:18:30,48
So you’re in a spaceship, and you wake up
and in the far distance you see a star, and


207
0:18:30,48 --> 0:18:35,549
it’s like almost miraculous in that all
the other stars stay the way they are but


208
0:18:35,549 --> 0:18:40,289
this one star, as you approach it gets bigger
and bigger and bigger, and then it stops being


209
0:18:40,289 --> 0:18:43,929
a point of light and starts becoming this
three-dimensional thing, and the closer you


210
0:18:43,929 --> 0:18:48,669
get to it, the more you’re sort of staring
at it in incredulity and fascination because


211
0:18:48,669 --> 0:18:54,5
it turns this big bug of appendages and things
sticking out. Then it becomes enormous and


212
0:18:54,5 --> 0:19:0,33
then it’s the size of a small town that
you are approaching, it’s huge. I felt that


213
0:19:0,33 --> 0:19:4,47
way coming up to Mir, I felt that way coming
up to station even when it was small, and


214
0:19:4,47 --> 0:19:9,12
now, from our little Soyuz looking out the
window to come to station, as big as it is


215
0:19:9,12 --> 0:19:15,289
now, we’ll see it, of course, the Japanese
module, the European module, then all the


216
0:19:15,289 --> 0:19:20,25
American segments up the middle, all of the
Russian segments in the back, the huge truss


217
0:19:20,25 --> 0:19:27,7
and the huge solar arrays: it’s a place
away from Earth that humans have built. It’s


218
0:19:27,7 --> 0:19:36,23
truly a big outpost or a big first great landing
in another part of the universe and it feels


219
0:19:36,23 --> 0:19:41,49
miraculous to sneak up on one of those and
to find it in space, then drive ourselves


220
0:19:41,49 --> 0:19:46,35
in and dock with our little spaceship, equalize
pressure, open the hatch and go into this


221
0:19:46,35 --> 0:19:54,169
thing. It’s every science fiction book,
it’s every Arthur C. Clarke’s imagination


222
0:19:54,169 --> 0:20:0,85
of what the orbital module might look like
as you come up, and it’s this little astronaut


223
0:20:0,85 --> 0:20:5,799
kid’s dream to be able to do that. It’s
a massive, capable, human creation orbiting


224
0:20:5,799 --> 0:20:10,559
the world, and I’m really looking forward
to opening that hatch.


225
0:20:10,559 --> 0:20:16,649
One of the pieces that were invaluable in
putting that together is Canadarm2. That’s


226
0:20:16,649 --> 0:20:22,69
a hunk of technology that you delivered to
the space station. Tell me what else is still


227
0:20:22,69 --> 0:20:28,419
to come for Canadian robotics and the station,
for Canadarm and Dextre [Special Purpose Dexterous


228
0:20:28,419 --> 0:20:31,95
Manipulator] and other things that are still
in the pipeline.


229
0:20:31,95 --> 0:20:36,46
The space station, as far as construction
goes, is almost finished. There’s a Russian


230
0:20:36,46 --> 0:20:42,35
laboratory to come up and there are other
piece parts to go on but fundamentally it’s


231
0:20:42,35 --> 0:20:48,98
built. That was job one for Canadarm2, to
grab things out of the back of the shuttle


232
0:20:48,98 --> 0:20:53,59
or to hand off from the shuttle’s arm to
the Canadarm2, take them around, build the


233
0:20:53,59 --> 0:20:58,529
station incrementally like a huge Meccano
set or a huge LEGO set, getting bigger and


234
0:20:58,529 --> 0:21:5,99
bigger. But that crane phase for the Canadarm,
the construction phase, is pretty much finished.


235
0:21:5,99 --> 0:21:11,99
Now it’s really just an extension of ourselves
on the outside. When we need to go out and


236
0:21:11,99 --> 0:21:15,769
look at something, it’s nice to have a camera
on the end that you can go have a good close


237
0:21:15,769 --> 0:21:25,49
look. When a new spaceship comes up, some
of them reach out, grab one, take it around,


238
0:21:25,49 --> 0:21:31,149
plug it in and help deliver all of the equipment
to station and then return them back to Earth


239
0:21:31,149 --> 0:21:39,96
or get rid of them again. Then also like a
cherry picker or like a Wichita lineman, sometimes


240
0:21:39,96 --> 0:21:46,62
you need to go out and fix something. You
need to use both hands and with the Canadarm2,


241
0:21:46,62 --> 0:21:51,759
as a spacewalker, you can click your feet
into the foot restraint and the arm can drive


242
0:21:51,759 --> 0:21:57,44
you around as if you were a tool on the end
of a surgeon’s probe, and then it’ll get


243
0:21:57,44 --> 0:22:3,39
you exactly where you need. As Suni [Williams]
and Aki [Hoshide] did recently in fixing the


244
0:22:3,39 --> 0:22:8,82
big electrical box on the outside of space
station. The arm is just a wonderful extension


245
0:22:8,82 --> 0:22:16,74
and tool for us to be able to work on the
outside of the space station. Canadarm2 after


246
0:22:16,74 --> 0:22:22,2
having helped build the station all the way
through continues to keep the station vital


247
0:22:22,2 --> 0:22:28,62
and capable. When something comes up with
new experiments, fresh food and clean clothes,


248
0:22:28,62 --> 0:22:34,399
that’s what we do, the grabbing and installing
and have our Christmas morning as a result


249
0:22:34,399 --> 0:22:36,1
of Canadarm2’s work.


250
0:22:36,1 --> 0:22:41,419
You’ve mentioned that the assembly of the
station that has gone, taken over ten years,


251
0:22:41,419 --> 0:22:47,34
pretty much done, and the focus now is turning
on to science. How do you explain to people


252
0:22:47,34 --> 0:22:56,61
what the potential is for what kind of science
return the station can provide?


253
0:22:56,61 --> 0:23:1,34
Having the laboratory like the space station
functions on two different levels. One is


254
0:23:1,34 --> 0:23:7,69
the obvious one that you have a laboratory
with basically no gravity. You can then do


255
0:23:7,69 --> 0:23:13,999
experiments that are impossible anywhere else—well,
maybe you can go to the top of a building,


256
0:23:13,999 --> 0:23:17,97
drop your experiment and it falls. The time
that it’s falling is sort of weightless;


257
0:23:17,97 --> 0:23:24,23
we do that, drop it down old mine shafts so
it can fall a couple thousand meters, but


258
0:23:24,23 --> 0:23:28,58
that’s only a short period of seconds and
there’s still the air drag slowing it down.


259
0:23:28,58 --> 0:23:32,71
You can put it in the back of an airplane
and maybe get 20 seconds of good weightlessness.


260
0:23:32,71 --> 0:23:39,149
On the space station we have perpetual absence
of gravity, and so there are all sorts of


261
0:23:39,149 --> 0:23:44,19
experiments that you can do on space station
that you can’t do anywhere else, and that


262
0:23:44,19 --> 0:23:50,2
is the fundamental core of it. But the other
part is, there are some things that are just


263
0:23:50,2 --> 0:23:58,369
fundamentally exciting to people and one of
them is exploration and leaving Earth. To


264
0:23:58,369 --> 0:24:2,899
be able to do this thing that is new in the
human experience is fundamentally exciting.


265
0:24:2,899 --> 0:24:7,35
When I sit next to somebody on a bus or in
an airplane and they find out that I’m one


266
0:24:7,35 --> 0:24:11,169
of the humans that leaves Earth, that’s
all we talk about from then on because no


267
0:24:11,169 --> 0:24:14,669
matter whom they are, this is an interesting
thing. This is new in the human experience.


268
0:24:14,669 --> 0:24:20,789
This is something that is sort of joyous and
exciting to hear about, and as a result of


269
0:24:20,789 --> 0:24:27,779
that it brings people together. That fundamental
shared excitement of something new in humanity’s


270
0:24:27,779 --> 0:24:33,299
experience, no matter where you’re from,
it brings people together and so it doesn’t


271
0:24:33,299 --> 0:24:37,809
just bring astronauts together or people on
the bus together, but it brings scientists


272
0:24:37,809 --> 0:24:45,129
and researchers together. Not only have we
built a place where you can do experiments


273
0:24:45,129 --> 0:24:49,45
with no gravity, where we have a lot of electricity,
a lot of time, a really good environment,


274
0:24:49,45 --> 0:24:55,94
but also it challenges and it inspires people
from all around the world to try and use this


275
0:24:55,94 --> 0:24:59,549
new experience, to bring them together, to
get people from one corner of the world talking


276
0:24:59,549 --> 0:25:5,299
to people from the other corner of the world
that without this shared new capability and


277
0:25:5,299 --> 0:25:9,39
challenge, they would never have spoken to
each other. And so it functions on both those


278
0:25:9,39 --> 0:25:14,35
levels, we see it every day on board station,
and a lot of the work that goes on is the


279
0:25:14,35 --> 0:25:20,179
daughter or granddaughter of that type of
great harmony of environments.


280
0:25:20,179 --> 0:25:25,669
Let’s talk about some of that research.
One of the areas that station research focuses


281
0:25:25,669 --> 0:25:32,159
on is finding out how being in that environment
affects a human body and what we can do to


282
0:25:32,159 --> 0:25:38,919
counteract the bad effects. Tell me about
two or three of the human life sciences investigations


283
0:25:38,919 --> 0:25:42,95
that you’re going to be involved with.


284
0:25:42,95 --> 0:25:49,69
If you’re going to do experiments on a space
station, some of them are going to be just


285
0:25:49,69 --> 0:25:53,59
taking advantage of the lack of gravity. Some
of them are going to be to look at the world,


286
0:25:53,59 --> 0:25:59,539
at the universe, to test equipment and to
just look at things that are different because


287
0:25:59,539 --> 0:26:4,619
there’s no gravity. One of the big differences
is how a human body functions when you take


288
0:26:4,619 --> 0:26:9,49
away gravity. Some of it is obvious. When
you swallow your food it doesn’t sit in


289
0:26:9,49 --> 0:26:15,429
the bottom of your stomach, it floats around.
When you are floating inside the station your


290
0:26:15,429 --> 0:26:20,86
balance system doesn’t know which way is
up. You don’t stand up and your body never


291
0:26:20,86 --> 0:26:29,33
has to push the blood back up to your head
again. For six months you don’t have to


292
0:26:29,33 --> 0:26:35,539
hold your head up, that’s how lazy you can
be. The resulting changes in the human body


293
0:26:35,539 --> 0:26:42,549
are one of the things that we study. One of
the experiments we have on board is called


294
0:26:42,549 --> 0:26:44,59
Vascular [Cardiovascular Health Consequences
of Long-Duration Space Flight], and it’s


295
0:26:44,59 --> 0:26:48,889
looking at what happens to the cardiovascular
system when you live in an environment like


296
0:26:48,889 --> 0:26:56,59
that. The heart actually shrinks. You’re
aging on a rapidly accelerated scale, your


297
0:26:56,59 --> 0:27:2,619
heart actually shrinks and your blood vessel
response changes; it actually sets us up to


298
0:27:2,619 --> 0:27:6,82
cardiovascular problems. If you had something
that was pretty low grade on Earth, after


299
0:27:6,82 --> 0:27:12,759
six months of an environment like that, a
risk of a heart attack or a stroke might actually


300
0:27:12,759 --> 0:27:18,379
be quite a bit higher. We have a sequence
of experiments that’s taking blood samples


301
0:27:18,379 --> 0:27:23,499
and monitoring our body while we’re exercising
and doing different things to try and understand


302
0:27:23,499 --> 0:27:29,889
what’s going on with our cardiovascular
system. It also challenges people to try and


303
0:27:29,889 --> 0:27:34,21
do the science in orbit. We have an experiment
called Microflow [Microflow technology demonstration]


304
0:27:34,21 --> 0:27:39,399
that used to be a big piece of equipment installed
at a hospital, they would try to figure out


305
0:27:39,399 --> 0:27:44,33
how can we actually sample the crew member’s
blood while they’re in orbit and get looking


306
0:27:44,33 --> 0:27:50,32
at the individual cellular level, as a result,
have got it down to the size of a toaster.


307
0:27:50,32 --> 0:27:56,249
It’s like Tony Stark in “Iron Man,”
where he’s trying to see if that thing in


308
0:27:56,249 --> 0:28:0,23
his chest has made his blood radioactive,
he puts this little thing in, tests his blood


309
0:28:0,23 --> 0:28:5,259
and looks at it. Now on orbit we have a thing
the size of a toaster, it’s not quite movie


310
0:28:5,259 --> 0:28:12,519
grade yet, but we can take a tiny amount of
blood, and using an optical system that was


311
0:28:12,519 --> 0:28:15,639
very recently developed, that little bit of
blood goes through there and it can give us


312
0:28:15,639 --> 0:28:22,649
results in blood analysis within ten minutes.
There’s a capability driven by an opportunity,


313
0:28:22,649 --> 0:28:28,799
driven by a set of circumstances that then
has great opportunity on Earth. If you can


314
0:28:28,799 --> 0:28:33,7
now do blood work with a very small machine,
then remote communities can do it and food


315
0:28:33,7 --> 0:28:39,779
processing factories can do it. It’s taking
this challenge and some of the limitations


316
0:28:39,779 --> 0:28:43,96
of what we’re doing, coming up with a new
product and then realizing that this is going


317
0:28:43,96 --> 0:28:49,61
to be good all over the place. That’s a
piece of hardware we’ll be testing on our


318
0:28:49,61 --> 0:28:55,149
crew. There’s a lot of orthostatic stuff
as well. The final piece I want to talk to


319
0:28:55,149 --> 0:29:9,789
you about is the aging process; the loss of
bone and the loss of muscle strength it is


320
0:29:9,789 --> 0:29:13,169
so rapid for astronauts in space. It’s as
if you spent months, years, or even decades


321
0:29:13,169 --> 0:29:21,379
on Earth, happens in just a few months in
orbit. Using changes in exercise and changes


322
0:29:21,379 --> 0:29:30,71
in diet, we have basically found a way to
beat that type of osteoporosis so that we


323
0:29:30,71 --> 0:29:35,739
can have crews that used to come back with
significant bone loss, now come back basically


324
0:29:35,739 --> 0:29:41,98
with no bone loss at all. This is really important
if we’re going to leave Earth, go to an


325
0:29:41,98 --> 0:29:47,149
asteroid or go to Mars, we don’t want the
person to show up on Mars as a jellyfish.


326
0:29:47,149 --> 0:29:51,989
They have to show up and be able to put on
their spacesuit, go out and explore the surface,


327
0:29:51,989 --> 0:29:56,399
or if after six months on station you have
an emergency spacewalk you need to be strong


328
0:29:56,399 --> 0:30:1,97
and fit with a good skeleton to go fight the
suit and work outside. For the people here


329
0:30:1,97 --> 0:30:8,95
on Earth that are naturally aging, getting
osteoporosis and muscle wasting, there is


330
0:30:8,95 --> 0:30:15,9
a combination of specific resistive exercise,
a regimen of exercise, and a specific type


331
0:30:15,9 --> 0:30:20,759
of diet, that we have proven in this environment.
It will allow an astronaut to stay healthy


332
0:30:20,759 --> 0:30:26,36
for the full six months, and therefore improving
health of people on Earth and allowing us


333
0:30:26,36 --> 0:30:28,379
to go further out into the solar system.


334
0:30:28,379 --> 0:30:34,169
And station is also packed with a lot of specialized
gear for science research in other scientific


335
0:30:34,169 --> 0:30:38,809
disciplines, too. Give me a couple of examples
of the different kinds of other science you’re


336
0:30:38,809 --> 0:30:42,269
going to be working on.


337
0:30:42,269 --> 0:30:48,249
We don’t know what the universe is made
of, strangely enough. We’ve been looking


338
0:30:48,249 --> 0:30:52,929
up at the sky, see things, but we really fundamentally
are just discovering that we don’t even


339
0:30:52,929 --> 0:30:57,239
really know what the universe is made of.
If you measure how fast stars and galaxies


340
0:30:57,239 --> 0:31:2,82
are moving away from each other the gravity,
gravitational pull numbers, it all doesn’t


341
0:31:2,82 --> 0:31:6,929
make sense unless you say, there must be something
out there causing these other effects. We


342
0:31:6,929 --> 0:31:11,85
call it dark matter and dark energy, by all
of our theories there should have been the


343
0:31:11,85 --> 0:31:17,7
same amount of matter and antimatter created
at the beginning of the universe. So how are


344
0:31:17,7 --> 0:31:22,389
you going to figure that out? It’s hard
down here on the surface; the atmosphere filters


345
0:31:22,389 --> 0:31:27,7
most of that information. So we decided a
little over a year ago to mount on top of


346
0:31:27,7 --> 0:31:36,34
the space station a seven-ton magnet that
collects the matter and the tiny little particles


347
0:31:36,34 --> 0:31:46,6
of the universe. It’s already processed
32 billion different particles from the universe.


348
0:31:46,6 --> 0:31:51,559
The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer and all of
the different sensors that are in it are trying


349
0:31:51,559 --> 0:31:58,6
to understand what the stuff of the universe
is: what are the origins of it and therefore


350
0:31:58,6 --> 0:32:2,19
what’s the future of it and what is our
place in it. That’s a really hard thing


351
0:32:2,19 --> 0:32:5,879
to do on the surface of the Earth, it’s
even hard to do on a satellite, but the station


352
0:32:5,879 --> 0:32:11,19
is a huge, powerful, stable platform above
the atmosphere for decades, and so it’s


353
0:32:11,19 --> 0:32:18,789
a great place to mount a long-term sensing
experiment like that. We also have a sensor


354
0:32:18,789 --> 0:32:24,359
on the outside looking at all the x-ray sources
in the universe, trying to understand black


355
0:32:24,359 --> 0:32:33,889
holes and some of the less visible stars out.
On the inside without gravity, heat doesn’t


356
0:32:33,889 --> 0:32:38,419
rise; seems simple but it’s hard to get
your mind around what that means. If you put


357
0:32:38,419 --> 0:32:44,2
a pot of water on a hot plate, it doesn’t
boil right because you don’t get cold water


358
0:32:44,2 --> 0:32:47,98
at the top and hot water at the bottom then
the heat rises and causes those nice convection


359
0:32:47,98 --> 0:32:52,21
patterns. So what happens if you take a tube
of water on the space station and you heat


360
0:32:52,21 --> 0:32:58,249
one end? Does the water just get warm at this
end and stay cold down here? Well, there was


361
0:32:58,249 --> 0:33:3,529
an Italian physicist, Marangoni, who realized
that surface tension, if you take a glass


362
0:33:3,529 --> 0:33:10,799
of wine and you swirl your glass of wine around
and you see how it sticks to the wine glass,


363
0:33:10,799 --> 0:33:18,39
that’s the surface tension, the viscosity
of the wine. That viscosity changes with temperature,


364
0:33:18,39 --> 0:33:24,49
so if you have a tube of water and you heat
one end, the Marangoni Effect, viscosity of


365
0:33:24,49 --> 0:33:27,84
the water, changes as you heat it; in effect,
the water starts to move around due to an


366
0:33:27,84 --> 0:33:42,529
entirely different process than we normally
can see 
on Earth. If you start thinking about it,


367
0:33:42,529 --> 0:33:46,47
you can then study all sorts of fundamental
fluid physics that we just can never study


368
0:33:46,47 --> 0:33:52,869
on Earth. We can look at how stars form because
here we have an environment with particulate


369
0:33:52,869 --> 0:33:58,45
in it just like little bits of matter in the
universe and get it spinning and see how those


370
0:33:58,45 --> 0:34:3,739
things behave over time, how they flow with
these Marangoni currents. We can design a


371
0:34:3,739 --> 0:34:10,95
blood sensor with just a tiny little bit of
human blood, but because we understand due


372
0:34:10,95 --> 0:34:15,379
to the Marangoni forces how it will flow,
we can then take a tiny blood sample and just


373
0:34:15,379 --> 0:34:20,3
using the viscosity of it, move it around
and sample it, so that’s an application


374
0:34:20,3 --> 0:34:26,86
for here on Earth. When you’re welding something
it’s not just gravity that’s moving the


375
0:34:26,86 --> 0:34:31,6
liquid metal around but it’s a lot of those
Marangoni forces. The viscosity forces melt


376
0:34:31,6 --> 0:34:38,15
the flux and the metal all together, and we
can better understand how welding works and


377
0:34:38,15 --> 0:34:48,98
improve quality of welding. So the space station
is this incredible, unique laboratory, an


378
0:34:48,98 --> 0:34:55,34
environment that has been really hard to build,
but we’ve created this thing. So many of


379
0:34:55,34 --> 0:35:0,5
the leading minds of the world, right up to
Nobel laureates, are using that capability


380
0:35:0,5 --> 0:35:6,3
up there to push further back into our understanding
of fundamental processes and where we are


381
0:35:6,3 --> 0:35:7,59
in the universe.


382
0:35:7,59 --> 0:35:12,44
And for the crew, you’re not only there
to help run those experiments, you’re there


383
0:35:12,44 --> 0:35:18,42
to make sure that the station continues to
operate so that those experiments can run.


384
0:35:18,42 --> 0:35:25,34
What do you do during the day? What’s a
crew member’s day like on board the station?


385
0:35:25,34 --> 0:35:31,76
For the people that have been out on a sailboat
or a ship for a long time, where you get out


386
0:35:31,76 --> 0:35:36,47
of sight of land, you’re there for some
purpose. Maybe you’re transporting equipment


387
0:35:36,47 --> 0:35:43,12
somewhere, you’re going to do research,
going to go look at coral reef life, or maybe


388
0:35:43,12 --> 0:35:46,42
you’re just out for a day sailing and you
want to get a tan or go visit or just have


389
0:35:46,42 --> 0:35:52,64
a nice time. Part of your day is to do what
you went for, to look at the coral reef or


390
0:35:52,64 --> 0:35:58,43
to lay back and look at your tan, but part
of it is getting the sailboat ready when you’re


391
0:35:58,43 --> 0:36:3,45
about to take it out of harbor. It is operating
the sailboat, steer it, get the sail trimmed


392
0:36:3,45 --> 0:36:10,0
right; you have to pay attention, things break.
Your compass starts sticking, your radio or


393
0:36:10,0 --> 0:36:14,12
the toilet in the sailboat doesn’t work
properly—part of your day is going to be


394
0:36:14,12 --> 0:36:19,66
that. Then part of your day is just taking
care of yourself as a human being, you need


395
0:36:19,66 --> 0:36:25,39
to sleep, eat, and wash. Space station’s
exactly the same. You spend part of your day


396
0:36:25,39 --> 0:36:30,63
just being a person. You wake up in the morning,
take care of all of your typical morning activities:


397
0:36:30,63 --> 0:36:36,57
breakfast, read the news, use the toilet,
get cleaned up, maybe exercise. We don’t


398
0:36:36,57 --> 0:36:41,58
get exercise for free on the space station
just by walking around, raising our arm or


399
0:36:41,58 --> 0:36:47,92
picking up water, you don’t fight gravity
ever, therefore you can be so lazy and you


400
0:36:47,92 --> 0:36:51,58
have to deliberately exercise, sort of like
if you were living on a boat, you have to


401
0:36:51,58 --> 0:36:56,49
deliberately exercise. Then part of your day
is fixing things. It’s a big, complicated


402
0:36:56,49 --> 0:37:0,24
structure and things break, so part of the
life of an astronaut is fixing everything


403
0:37:0,24 --> 0:37:7,75
from a cord in the back of a laptop that has
stopped working to the air purification system,


404
0:37:7,75 --> 0:37:13,47
or maybe something as huge as going outside
to replace or repair a big piece of the station


405
0:37:13,47 --> 0:37:18,31
that has broken. Another part of the day is
running the experiments on board, which is


406
0:37:18,31 --> 0:37:22,72
the real core purpose of being there. Your
days are divided up just like that. Every


407
0:37:22,72 --> 0:37:28,6
day you’re a human being staying alive,
a technician keeping the space station alive,


408
0:37:28,6 --> 0:37:31,98
and a scientist doing research.


409
0:37:31,98 --> 0:37:36,82
When you arrive on the Soyuz spacecraft, you’re
going to join the International Space Station


410
0:37:36,82 --> 0:37:43,31
crew as a flight engineer, but in the midst
of your mission, when Expedition 35 begins,


411
0:37:43,31 --> 0:37:47,1
you’re going to become the commander of
the International Space Station. How’s that


412
0:37:47,1 --> 0:37:50,45
change life for you?


413
0:37:50,45 --> 0:37:56,64
I’m lucky enough to be able to spend just
a little under six months, on the space station.


414
0:37:56,64 --> 0:38:5,8
It is a long time, six months, a lot of things
can happen, but for the first half, which


415
0:38:5,8 --> 0:38:11,34
I count myself really lucky, is that I don’t
have to show up there and be in charge. I


416
0:38:11,34 --> 0:38:17,74
show up and the commander will be Kevin Ford,
and what a great opportunity for me to learn


417
0:38:17,74 --> 0:38:21,62
because eventually I’m going to be asked
to command the space station, but I don’t


418
0:38:21,62 --> 0:38:27,53
have to jump in and be full speed, running
and take over right away. I can do a bunch


419
0:38:27,53 --> 0:38:32,78
of on the job training. I can “fleet up,”
as they say in the Navy, and I can do my job,


420
0:38:32,78 --> 0:38:38,76
be a flight engineer answerable to the commander,
and listen to all the ways that Kevin has


421
0:38:38,76 --> 0:38:42,22
decided. Kevin is learning them from Suni
Williams who learned them from Gennady Padalka


422
0:38:42,22 --> 0:38:49,14
so there’s this long pedigree of refined
and proven ways to do things that are never


423
0:38:49,14 --> 0:38:53,2
going to be seen properly here on our simulators.
There’s always subtle differences, so I


424
0:38:53,2 --> 0:39:0,7
will have three months to really learn how
Kevin’s running things and look at it: if


425
0:39:0,7 --> 0:39:3,68
I were the commander I would do that; I would
do that differently, I wouldn’t do that,


426
0:39:3,68 --> 0:39:9,38
and I’ll be able to pick and choose. Come
March, when it’s time for Kevin and his


427
0:39:9,38 --> 0:39:14,22
crew to get into their Soyuz and go home,
he and I will have a ceremony on board, salute


428
0:39:14,22 --> 0:39:21,54
each other, and from that moment on the health
of my crew, the space station, and all of


429
0:39:21,54 --> 0:39:26,78
the things we’re trying to do productively,
are all resting on my shoulders, weightlessly,


430
0:39:26,78 --> 0:39:33,63
but resting on my shoulders. I need to be
ready for that. I’ve been training with


431
0:39:33,63 --> 0:39:38,96
that in mind for several years here on Earth,
working to build the crew, to make sure we


432
0:39:38,96 --> 0:39:43,83
have the skills but also the relationship
that would allow us to be healthy and productive


433
0:39:43,83 --> 0:39:48,36
during that time, and also making sure that
I understand things well enough. No matter


434
0:39:48,36 --> 0:39:52,82
what breaks on the station or no matter what
experiment’s going on, I have to have some


435
0:39:52,82 --> 0:39:59,1
understanding so that I can make the right
decisions, as things happen during the six


436
0:39:59,1 --> 0:40:5,67
months. At this stage in my career, in my
50s, I’ve been an astronaut 20 years, flown


437
0:40:5,67 --> 0:40:13,35
a couple times, I consider it a huge lucky
break, because I’ve been gathering experience,


438
0:40:13,35 --> 0:40:17,28
I’ve been trying to see how to do these
things. I’ve been learning from other people,


439
0:40:17,28 --> 0:40:25,12
and to be given the opportunity to command
what is essentially the world’s spaceship,


440
0:40:25,12 --> 0:40:32,26
now at this stage of my career, I consider
it a great responsibility but also a great


441
0:40:32,26 --> 0:40:38,84
turn of events and a great challenge and opportunity
for myself. I’m really looking forward to


442
0:40:38,84 --> 0:40:39,46
it.


443
0:40:39,46 --> 0:40:43,32
You’re also going to be the first Canadian
astronaut to command the space station. What’s


444
0:40:43,32 --> 0:40:49,74
it mean for Canada and Canada’s space agency
to have a commander?


445
0:40:49,74 --> 0:40:54,75
Canada had its first spacecraft go to orbit
50 years ago; it was called Alouette. We were


446
0:40:54,75 --> 0:40:59,39
the third nation on Earth to have a satellite
in space. We did it cooperatively—it was


447
0:40:59,39 --> 0:41:4,9
on an American rocket, but a Canadian satellite,
so it kind of laid the grounds for how we’re


448
0:41:4,9 --> 0:41:9,45
doing everything. We have some specialty back
home in Canada. We have a set of our own interests,


449
0:41:9,45 --> 0:41:13,69
in this case, the upper atmosphere and the
northern lights. Living in the north, we had


450
0:41:13,69 --> 0:41:19,35
a need, a capability, we cooperated with another
nation and we got ourselves into space. So


451
0:41:19,35 --> 0:41:26,1
we’ve been in the game from the beginning
right on the accomplishments of Alouette,


452
0:41:26,1 --> 0:41:33,84
that very first satellite. Canada has almost
linearly built our capability and our responsibility


453
0:41:33,84 --> 0:41:39,87
and therefore our international respect over
time. We went from that to sensing satellites,


454
0:41:39,87 --> 0:41:45,2
telecommunications satellites, RADARSAT, the
first Canadian to fly on the shuttle, Canadarm


455
0:41:45,2 --> 0:41:51,29
which did so many things from the Hubble telescope
to all of the satellites. It grabbed and released,


456
0:41:51,29 --> 0:41:56,6
and then with the other arm, onto the space
station. We’ve had Canadians go, from Mark


457
0:41:56,6 --> 0:42:0,68
Garneau, our first who was a payload specialist
back in the early ’80s, through to Julie


458
0:42:0,68 --> 0:42:7,37
Payette who was the main flight engineer running
the space shuttle during her last flight,


459
0:42:7,37 --> 0:42:13,6
and then Bob Thirsk who lived on station as
a flight engineer. Even though no one could


460
0:42:13,6 --> 0:42:18,62
map it out on purpose that way, it has appeared
fairly linearly and progressive to now where


461
0:42:18,62 --> 0:42:25,55
Canada is in a position to have a Canadian
command the International Space Station. Each


462
0:42:25,55 --> 0:42:30,14
has been a door opening of possibilities for
young Canadian kids: this is something you


463
0:42:30,14 --> 0:42:34,38
can do, this isn’t just a dream but this
is an actual career choice; this is a thing


464
0:42:34,38 --> 0:42:41,84
that can happen in your life. As a result,
this is a big deal in Canada. This is a brand


465
0:42:41,84 --> 0:42:49,41
new capability. It’s something to be proud
of, something to look at in perspective of


466
0:42:49,41 --> 0:42:53,46
time, look backwards and see how we got here,
look forwards and say, look where this is


467
0:42:53,46 --> 0:43:0,97
going. We’re going to other planets eventually
and Canada is part of this. I feel the responsibility


468
0:43:0,97 --> 0:43:6,12
of that as the first Canadian to do it. Fundamentally,
for me it’s the first time. Regardless,


469
0:43:6,12 --> 0:43:11,5
it’s a big deal for me, but also it’s
a big deal for my country, for my space agency


470
0:43:11,5 --> 0:43:19,23
and for where I’m from, and I’m happy
that people are interested in it. I’m fundamentally


471
0:43:19,23 --> 0:43:26,56
happy that this is a continuation of all of
those capabilities and it continues to open


472
0:43:26,56 --> 0:43:29,32
opportunities for the Canadians that follow
after me.


473
0:43:29,32 --> 0:43:37,53
What’ll it mean to you to have been that
Canadian who was first?


474
0:43:37,53 --> 0:43:41,76
I hate to jinx something by talking about
things in advance because I would like things


475
0:43:41,76 --> 0:43:48,93
to go well; that’s been my goal for a decade,
preparing for this flight of getting myself


476
0:43:48,93 --> 0:43:55,33
into a position to try and do this job well.
Since the outset I’ve said I want to come


477
0:43:55,33 --> 0:44:0,72
back with a healthy crew, with a crew that
sort of my measure is, would they want to


478
0:44:0,72 --> 0:44:4,68
go do this again right away and if they want
to go do this again, then it was a good human


479
0:44:4,68 --> 0:44:10,4
experience. I want to come back with a healthy
space station, and having done as much of


480
0:44:10,4 --> 0:44:21,32
the science as we possibly could in our six
months on the station. If through luck and


481
0:44:21,32 --> 0:44:27,7
the work of the crew we get all those things
done, then of course this is one of the pinnacles


482
0:44:27,7 --> 0:44:33,53
of what I was asked to do during my life,
and this is a big event for me personally.


483
0:44:33,53 --> 0:44:40,19
It takes a lot of work, a lot of focus, but
it deserves it and I’m really working hard


484
0:44:40,19 --> 0:44:45,77
hoping that when we land at the end of May
that I’ll be able to look back and say I


485
0:44:45,77 --> 0:44:51,14
did what I set out to do and I handed the
station off to Pavel Vinogradov in as good


486
0:44:51,14 --> 0:44:57,71
a state as I possibly could. It’s something
that I can look back on as an accomplishment


487
0:44:57,71 --> 0:45:0,94
and a threshold of my life that was really
important for me.


488
0:45:0,94 --> 0:45:6,51
Anyone who has taken a look at your biography
sees that among many interests that you have,


489
0:45:6,51 --> 0:45:11,42
music is one of them, and you’ve got some
special music plans for this mission. Tell


490
0:45:11,42 --> 0:45:18,49
me about your plans for recording music and
a sing-along with students all across Canada.


491
0:45:18,49 --> 0:45:23,44
On board the space station there’s a Canadian
guitar. It’s a Larrivee, made in Vancouver.


492
0:45:23,44 --> 0:45:27,74
That’s just luck, I didn’t get the guitar
up there, but it turns out when they bought


493
0:45:27,74 --> 0:45:32,83
one in a local guitar shop here in Houston,
they ended up buying a Larrivee, which is


494
0:45:32,83 --> 0:45:37,39
great, it’s a nice guitar. I play guitar
in a couple bands and sing. I’ve fronted


495
0:45:37,39 --> 0:45:43,14
bands here in Houston for 20 years, and it’s
just a natural extension for me to play music


496
0:45:43,14 --> 0:45:47,92
no matter where I am, whether it’s at Star
City or Tsukuba, Japan, or on board the space


497
0:45:47,92 --> 0:45:53,38
station; I played guitar on board Mir when
I was there back in 1995. I thought, since


498
0:45:53,38 --> 0:46:1,71
I’m there long enough; why not write music
about the experience of traveling in space.


499
0:46:1,71 --> 0:46:8,16
The early sailors, the early miners, the early
cowboys, the pioneers that moved into a new


500
0:46:8,16 --> 0:46:17,81
human environment, all of them have recorded
the experience not just in journals, but also


501
0:46:17,81 --> 0:46:26,39
in song and in music. To be able to use that
new environment to help inspire art in the


502
0:46:26,39 --> 0:46:32,7
form of music is a way that I thrive on Earth.
I’m not by any means the world’s best


503
0:46:32,7 --> 0:46:37,82
musician, but I love it and I’ve had lots
of people to play music with. To be able to


504
0:46:37,82 --> 0:46:43,23
do that on space station is fairly new in
the human experience and I want to make the


505
0:46:43,23 --> 0:46:47,45
most of it. You can record it lots of different
ways. You can write a journal, a blog every


506
0:46:47,45 --> 0:46:53,45
day, take a million photographs out the window,
try and capture this new human experience


507
0:46:53,45 --> 0:46:59,38
different ways. For me, music is a great way
to do that recording. I’ve half-written


508
0:46:59,38 --> 0:47:4,2
a bunch of songs and I’ve completed some.
I’ve made sure that we have the equipment


509
0:47:4,2 --> 0:47:9,11
on board, not just the guitar but the right
combinations of pickups, microphones, recording


510
0:47:9,11 --> 0:47:15,97
equipment, and files and how to get it down
to the ground, so that we have a reasonable


511
0:47:15,97 --> 0:47:21,14
recording studio on the International Space
Station. I’m going to have the chance to


512
0:47:21,14 --> 0:47:28,1
float weightless inside the Cupola with the
world rolling by underneath playing a guitar


513
0:47:28,1 --> 0:47:33,63
inside probably the most scenic recording
studio that’s ever existed, and a chance


514
0:47:33,63 --> 0:47:39,95
to record the songs that I have written, to
work and write new songs or expand the songs


515
0:47:39,95 --> 0:47:50,28
while I’m up there, and for the rest of
my life, to have those as my souvenirs, my


516
0:47:50,28 --> 0:47:58,14
memories of living away from the Earth. My
brother, who I write songs with, said, imagine


517
0:47:58,14 --> 0:48:2,38
if the first people going to Mars, if when
they sit around their mess table on the six


518
0:48:2,38 --> 0:48:5,83
months on the way to Mars and they sing old
space songs and one of the songs they sing


519
0:48:5,83 --> 0:48:10,67
is something that you wrote on board the space
station, a space shanty or whatever, what


520
0:48:10,67 --> 0:48:19,81
an interesting idea, and it’s not inconceivable,
so I’m really looking forward to that. Playing


521
0:48:19,81 --> 0:48:25,94
music in space also attracts a lot of interest
from other musicians. Lots of musicians of


522
0:48:25,94 --> 0:48:30,21
all different levels, right up to some pretty
famous bands have said, hey, we would love


523
0:48:30,21 --> 0:48:35,73
to play with you while you’re up there or
record something and we’ll incorporate you


524
0:48:35,73 --> 0:48:41,31
into our concert or something like that. I’ve
been looking at what’s the best way to do


525
0:48:41,31 --> 0:48:47,12
that. One of them is with schools across Canada.
How do you get involved with all the grade


526
0:48:47,12 --> 0:48:51,66
school and high school bands across the country,
and there are couple good programs that exist.


527
0:48:51,66 --> 0:49:0,1
One is called MusiCounts, and they try to
have one Canadian celebrity song a year that


528
0:49:0,1 --> 0:49:4,5
is then learned by the school choirs and played
during the year and it’s themed for the


529
0:49:4,5 --> 0:49:8,4
year or some sort of particular theme. This
year they decided to make a space theme and


530
0:49:8,4 --> 0:49:13,6
they teamed me with one of the musicians in
the Canadian band called Barenaked Ladies,


531
0:49:13,6 --> 0:49:17,44
guy named Ed Robertson; Ed’s a great songwriter,
he’s from the part of the world that I’m


532
0:49:17,44 --> 0:49:21,8
from. So we’ve been working together for
about a year now on a song, and actually this


533
0:49:21,8 --> 0:49:32,32
week we just recorded sort of the final version
of the song, and it will be put into full


534
0:49:32,32 --> 0:49:36,39
orchestrated form and sent to schools so that
the high school bands all have their particular,


535
0:49:36,39 --> 0:49:39,66
the third trumpet has his part to play and
the whole thing put together, choirs will


536
0:49:39,66 --> 0:49:45,5
learn the words, and then I will be recording
a part of it on the space station as well


537
0:49:45,5 --> 0:49:50,45
and sending it down. There will then be a
way to have the Barenaked Ladies’ version


538
0:49:50,45 --> 0:49:55,92
of it with me adding in harmonies and singing
verses and playing a little bit of guitar,


539
0:49:55,92 --> 0:50:2,82
and then at school concerts throughout the
school year, they will be able to play along


540
0:50:2,82 --> 0:50:7,55
with us. They’ll be able to use our recording,
our music, or even conceivably the whole thing


541
0:50:7,55 --> 0:50:13,31
happening live or partially live with my recording
and Ed Robertson and company. It’s a really


542
0:50:13,31 --> 0:50:20,69
nice different way, to tie the newness of
the experience and the imaginative part of


543
0:50:20,69 --> 0:50:26,94
the experience with people all across the
country. It’s a real privilege to be a part


544
0:50:26,94 --> 0:50:27,45
of that.


545
0:50:27,45 --> 0:50:29,68
Sounds like it’ll be fun.


546
0:50:29,68 --> 0:50:32,36
Oh yeah, it’ll be fun, too.


547
0:50:32,36 --> 0:50:39,41
Any increment on the space station has the
plan to remain flexible to respond to things


548
0:50:39,41 --> 0:50:45,48
that you made reference to earlier. Sometimes
that means going outside. What is, as we speak


549
0:50:45,48 --> 0:50:50,16
today, what is the plan for spacewalks during
your time on board?


550
0:50:50,16 --> 0:50:55,2
We have a richness of experience in our crew.
People have done multiple spacewalks in the


551
0:50:55,2 --> 0:51:4,32
past, both on the Russian side and on the
U.S. side or the Canadian side, so we’ve


552
0:51:4,32 --> 0:51:9,85
been training for years to do spacewalks.
There are all sorts of things that we have


553
0:51:9,85 --> 0:51:13,3
looked at and said, if this fails we have
to go out and do a spacewalk within this number


554
0:51:13,3 --> 0:51:19,92
of days to go fix it—electrical things,
cooling things or something like that. So


555
0:51:19,92 --> 0:51:26,87
we’re ready to go do those. Right now, as
of today, there is nothing broken on the space


556
0:51:26,87 --> 0:51:32,5
station that will absolutely, black and white,
hard-require us to go outside, but sort of


557
0:51:32,5 --> 0:51:37,12
like maintenance on your car—well, I think
I can get another hundred miles out or another


558
0:51:37,12 --> 0:51:42,16
thousand miles out before I have to change
the oil or get the air conditioner fixed.


559
0:51:42,16 --> 0:51:46,58
Well, another thousand miles go by and you
go, maybe another 500—there’s a lot of


560
0:51:46,58 --> 0:51:50,73
things on station like that, too. You don’t
want to replace things that don’t need replacing,


561
0:51:50,73 --> 0:51:55,32
but there is some sort of regular maintenance
required to keep a machine running, and, unlike


562
0:51:55,32 --> 0:51:58,87
your car, where if it breaks you can just
pull over to the side and call AAA or call


563
0:51:58,87 --> 0:52:3,35
a tow truck, if the station has a serious
problem we have to continue to live and survive


564
0:52:3,35 --> 0:52:11,23
up there, so it’s a real balance, juggling,
guessing game as to when you have to go outside


565
0:52:11,23 --> 0:52:19,76
and fix things. We’re trying to make sure
that the crew can go outside and do any of


566
0:52:19,76 --> 0:52:24,59
the spacewalks it may be asked to do, everything
from something minor like retrieving a payload,


567
0:52:24,59 --> 0:52:27,89
the MISSE [Materials International Space Station
Experiment] payload that is collecting particles


568
0:52:27,89 --> 0:52:33,13
of the universe, it’s been out there collecting
them for years, we can fold that up like a


569
0:52:33,13 --> 0:52:36,66
big suitcase and bring it inside, and that
would be a good thing to do. There are cameras


570
0:52:36,66 --> 0:52:40,83
and lights outside that have failed that decrease
our capability to see what we’re doing;


571
0:52:40,83 --> 0:52:47,28
some of those need to be swapped out. There
are covers that need to go on certain parts


572
0:52:47,28 --> 0:52:53,86
of the station to improve and lengthen their
life because of all the thermal cycles and


573
0:52:53,86 --> 0:52:56,32
the micrometeorite damage. There’s a big
long shopping list of stuff we really should


574
0:52:56,32 --> 0:52:59,31
do as soon as we get outside and have the
spare time. Like doing maintenance on your


575
0:52:59,31 --> 0:53:2,32
house; I have to clean out the gutters—that
can wait a little while but the next time


576
0:53:2,32 --> 0:53:6,39
it rains it’s going to be a mess. That’s
kind of the boat we’re in. So as a crew


577
0:53:6,39 --> 0:53:13,81
we’re trained, we’re ready, and we’re
optimistic that something’ll break.


578
0:53:13,81 --> 0:53:19,56
The landscape of spaceflight is changing these
days. Now we’ve got private companies even


579
0:53:19,56 --> 0:53:24,19
flying supply ships to the space station and,
and all the different countries in the world


580
0:53:24,19 --> 0:53:29,4
working together instead of competing. Is
this the kind of arrangement, that you see


581
0:53:29,4 --> 0:53:34,26
continuing on into the future of human space
exploration?


582
0:53:34,26 --> 0:53:40,12
Space travel is hard. It’s easy to do if
you’re willing to kill people regularly—like


583
0:53:40,12 --> 0:53:45,71
in the early days of aviation, planes crashed
all the time, people got injured, it was sort


584
0:53:45,71 --> 0:53:49,11
of [the attitude] “you know, it’s a risky
business, OK, people are going to die.”


585
0:53:49,11 --> 0:53:56,22
That’s not acceptable in space travel. Because
of the complexity, the cost and the visibility


586
0:53:56,22 --> 0:54:3,63
of it, we want it to be safe, as safe as we
possibly can, and therefore it takes a lot


587
0:54:3,63 --> 0:54:8,76
of preparation and it’s expensive and it’s
rare. When something takes a lot of preparation


588
0:54:8,76 --> 0:54:13,3
and it’s expensive and rare, it’s hard
to do as one person, it’s hard to do as


589
0:54:13,3 --> 0:54:18,86
a small group or even as an individual company,
sometimes even as a nation. I mean, Canada


590
0:54:18,86 --> 0:54:22,76
has not decided to launch their own people
into space because of the complexity and the


591
0:54:22,76 --> 0:54:27,87
cost; we would rather share the costs with
another country or another group of countries


592
0:54:27,87 --> 0:54:34,67
in order to make it as economically logical
as possible, and the whole world is doing


593
0:54:34,67 --> 0:54:39,11
that for the International Space Station,
or at least 15 of the leading nations of the


594
0:54:39,11 --> 0:54:45,47
world. That makes sense. If we had some huge
breakthrough in engines so that suddenly getting


595
0:54:45,47 --> 0:54:49,67
to space was just as easy as driving to the
corner store, if you could just have your


596
0:54:49,67 --> 0:54:55,44
“Back to the Future” little thing on top
of your car where you throw in a banana peel


597
0:54:55,44 --> 0:54:59,5
and “poof!” you’re off to space, the
whole game would be different and people would


598
0:54:59,5 --> 0:55:4,0
be going all the time. But it is still complex,
hard, dangerous and expensive, and so for


599
0:55:4,0 --> 0:55:11,98
the foreseeable future it is going to be,
both at the business level and at the governmental


600
0:55:11,98 --> 0:55:16,8
level, an international venture to build and
live on the space station, go to the moon,


601
0:55:16,8 --> 0:55:26,38
go to asteroids, and go to Mars. I think it’s
the right thing to do. I think as a species,


602
0:55:26,38 --> 0:55:30,65
as a shared group of people living on the
surface of this planet, it makes sense if


603
0:55:30,65 --> 0:55:35,44
we’re going to leave it and go somewhere
else in the solar system that we should try


604
0:55:35,44 --> 0:55:39,55
and do it as collectively as possible, both
to share the cost of it but also to share


605
0:55:39,55 --> 0:55:46,1
the benefits of it. So it’s kind of driven
by the physics and the complexity, but there’s


606
0:55:46,1 --> 0:55:51,73
certain purity and a beauty to that. The result
that we’re doing it internationally and


607
0:55:51,73 --> 0:55:56,9
collectively, I think, is a really good one,
and I hope that we can prolong that as long


608
0:55:56,9 --> 0:56:6,75
as possible and not turn it into just a purely
competitive, a one-shot deal or kind of a


609
0:56:6,75 --> 0:56:10,37
thoughtless, selfish way of exploring the
universe. I really like the way we’re doing


610
0:56:10,37 --> 0:56:13,62
it as a species right now and I want to help
prolong that.


611
0:56:13,62 --> 0:56:20,66
What is it that we are learning now on this
space station that is preparing us for future


612
0:56:20,66 --> 0:56:24,99
exploration further beyond Earth orbit?


613
0:56:24,99 --> 0:56:30,81
On the space station, let’s look at something
really simple; a little pump that has to move


614
0:56:30,81 --> 0:56:37,32
water around like the pump in your radiator
in your car. Well, pumps have liquid in there,


615
0:56:37,32 --> 0:56:42,22
the pump spins and it moves the liquid through.
Without gravity the liquid doesn’t stay


616
0:56:42,22 --> 0:56:47,26
in the bottom part of the pipe. It will stick
to the walls of the pipe and the pump will


617
0:56:47,26 --> 0:56:52,23
just be spinning and moving air through the
middle, so a pump doesn’t work in space.


618
0:56:52,23 --> 0:56:56,41
You need to redesign it, and once redesigned,
it doesn’t cool itself normally because


619
0:56:56,41 --> 0:57:1,91
heat doesn’t rise, so how do you keep your
pump from overheating? Seems trivial and simple,


620
0:57:1,91 --> 0:57:5,75
but you have to solve that problem. How do
you build a space pump? How do you build a


621
0:57:5,75 --> 0:57:11,66
space fan? How do you build a space computer,
a space toilet, a space everything? How do


622
0:57:11,66 --> 0:57:20,51
you make sure that it’s going to work? Because
if you say, let’s go to the biggest rock


623
0:57:20,51 --> 0:57:25,3
in the asteroid belt; OK, and now we are,
our spaceship needs pumps. Well, if you launch


624
0:57:25,3 --> 0:57:28,6
from Earth and you start leaving Earth and
you find out that you had a bad idea how to


625
0:57:28,6 --> 0:57:32,91
build pumps, then you can’t just turn around
and come home and you’re fundamentally flawed.


626
0:57:32,91 --> 0:57:38,49
You need to test those somewhere, and you
can’t test things perfectly here on the


627
0:57:38,49 --> 0:57:42,52
surface of the Earth because you can’t escape
gravity and the effects of gravity, so the


628
0:57:42,52 --> 0:57:49,92
space station is the test-bed for the spaceships
of the future. Just by its very nature we’re


629
0:57:49,92 --> 0:57:53,91
learning what works and what doesn’t work,
how to collect solar energy from the sun,


630
0:57:53,91 --> 0:58:0,3
make it power and cool a spaceship; how to,
what thrusters, what fuel should you use,


631
0:58:0,3 --> 0:58:4,83
how do you have your thrusters work; what
material do you build your spaceship from—if


632
0:58:4,83 --> 0:58:8,87
you know you’re going to get peppered by
micrometeorites and ultraviolet energy from


633
0:58:8,87 --> 0:58:14,41
the sun and radiation from the universe, what
do you build it out of? We’re experimenting


634
0:58:14,41 --> 0:58:20,38
deliberately, and just by de facto, just by
being there, with all of those things on the


635
0:58:20,38 --> 0:58:27,76
space station, and it is our big proving ground.
It is our test track for building spaceships


636
0:58:27,76 --> 0:58:33,26
in the future, and it is therefore the diving
board, the launching board, that’s going


637
0:58:33,26 --> 0:58:35,54
to allow us to confidently go further away
from Earth.
