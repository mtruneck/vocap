###27 KEVIN JONES: So here we are in this crazy
###31 place, Red Rocks, Colorado.
###33 And we're at the "TB20" premiere.
###36 MIKE HATCHETT: TB is Totally Board, and
###37 20 is our 20th film.
###40 Feel like we accomplished something there, and feel like
###43 that was a major, I guess, milestone.
###46 Whatever-- sounds kind of cheesy or whatever, but to get
###48 to 20 years, I'm happy to be able to actually work in the
###52 snowboard industry for 20 years.
###55 TRAVIS ROBB: When you hit a 20-year
###56 thing, it's a big deal.
###57 It's more about everybody at this point that's ever been
###61 involved, ever put effort into it.
###64 That's really what the movie's about.
###65 DAVE HATCHETT: I honestly never envisioned that Standard
###68 Films would last this long.
###69 And we have definitely outlasted every other film
###71 company out there.
###72 We were before they all started, and
###74 we're still there now.
###75 JIM RIPPEY: Standard films is notorious for getting up
###77 early, and getting onto those obstacles, and getting out
###80 there and getting the shots.
###82 And it takes a lot of hard work.
###84 And that's a big part of their success.
###86 KEVIN JONES: There wasn't 6,000 film crews
###89 like there is today.
###90 If you wanted to have any kind of living back then, you had
###93 to make it in Standard Films, period.
###95 [CHEERING]
###107 
###113 MIKE HATCHETT: Yeah, so we're here at Alpine Meadows, and we
###114 got a triple line built--
###117 three jumps in a row.
###118 Kind of like a rhythm section, like a moto section.
###121 So we're lucking out, killer weather.
###124 25 foot of snow base here still.
###126 Record snow year here in Tahoe.
###129 Could be sick.
###130 
###135 GJERMUND BRATEN: This is the line I'd like
###137 to pull a Four Loko.
###139 I had a Four Loko at the after party last night.
###142 -Did you?
###142 Ooh.
###143 GJERMUND BRATEN: Killed me.
###144 
###147 MIKE HATCHETT: One person should shoot right here.
###149 This is cool.
###151 I like this.
###152 
###158 GJERMUND BRATEN: I was so stoked to get invited to shoot
###160 with Standard.
###161 It's especially big because it's "TB20," and that's kind
###168 of a big deal.
###169 [MUSIC - MEAN JEANS, "STEVE DON'T PARTY NO MORE]

###200 [CHEERING]
###212 JEREMY JONES: I feel like Standard Films not only had a
###214 huge influence on snowboarding but in action
###216 sports movies in general.
###219 DAVE HATCHETT: If it's snowboarding, we show it.
###221 We're not a freestyle company.
###223 We're not a big mountain film company.
###224 We show rails, we show park, we show backcountry booters,
###228 we show it all.
###229 JEREMY JONES: Putting all their energy on getting the
###232 best riders, filming them all season, and whittling down
###236 their stuff to three-minute parts where you just show the
###239 best stuff, and really letting the
###242 snowboarding do the talking.
###244 [MUSIC - MEAN JEANS, "STEVE DON'T PARTY NO MORE]
###245 
###270 -Yeah!
###272 MIKE HATCHETT: Yeah, Gulli!
###273 
###277 Nice work.
###278 That was sick.
###280 When I got out of school, I imagined myself as a fashion
###282 photographer or a commercial photographer, shooting fruit
###285 and toothpaste or whatever-- cars.
###287 I was going to be in the studio with a flash.
###290 I wasn't thinking about shooting snowboarding.
###292 And then Dave invited me out to go rock climbing.
###293 And he takes me climbing for the day, and I'm kind of
###296 checking their scene out.
###297 I'm like, how long you guys staying here for?
###300 Two months.
###302 Two months?
###303 In your car, living in your car?
###306 That lifestyle never occurred to me.
###308 Then he invites me out to go snowboarding,
###309 which I'd never done.
###311 Got hooked on that pretty much instantly.
###313 DAVE HATCHETT: I just told him, man, you've got to come
###314 up here and check this sport out.
###315 This is going to be awesome.
###316 It's really, really fun, and it's so
###318 much funner than skiing.
###319 And you're going to really dig it because it's like surfing.
###321 MIKE HATCHETT: I think by the third weekend,
###323 I'm like, fuck school.
###325 I'm getting out of here.
###326 I'm going to go live in my car for two years.
###327 DAVE HATCHETT: Mike and I started this film company
###329 called Fusion Films, which was kind of a precursor to
###331 Standard Films.
###332 And we really just--
###334 we went in the backcountry, because we
###335 needed to get footage.
###336 And the ski resorts will just get chopped up so quick, and
###339 it just wasn't aesthetically that rad to film.
###341 So we were just looking across the street from Donner Ski
###344 Ranch, and we just knew it was all virgin, untracked powder,
###347 and it was a lot easier to work back there and get shots.
###349 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###356 DAVE HATCHETT: It was is just the very first times that
###358 anyone filmed snowboarding in the backcountry or anywhere.
###361 So we kind of got this idea, I'll be the rider.
###363 Mike will be the cinematographer.
###365 We'll get some friends of ours, and we'll all just be
###368 together, and we'll make this movie.
###369 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###378 DAVE HATCHETT: The movie came out pretty good.
###379 It was a pretty fun to watch movie.
###383 At the time, it was cutting edge.
###385 And financially, it just bombed.
###388 We just didn't sell enough videos.
###389 And then we tried to get sponsorship again the next
###391 year, and it didn't happen.
###392 MIKE HATCHETT: After we had made "Totally Board," I worked
###394 for Fall Line Films for two years.
###396 And Dave and I--
###397 Dave was filming with Mack Dawg.
###399 And Dave's like, dude, you and Mack Dawg should start your
###402 own company.
###403 Jerry and Artie aren't treating you very
###405 good at Fall Line.
###406 And it was his, actually, idea.
###408 You guys should put the big mountain stuff in with the
###411 freestyle, and we should make a movie.
###412 JIM RIPPEY: So they basically said, hey, let's meet the
###416 minds, and let's create something together that brings
###419 both aspects of snowboarding.
###420 You go to Alaska and get your big mountain riding.
###423 We'll mix the best of that big mountain riding with all the
###426 jibbing and freestyle park type stuff.
###429 DAVE HATCHETT: We were just pretty much just sitting in
###430 the house one day, and I said hey, let's send out a proposal
###433 and see if we can kind of try and do what we did with Fusion
###436 Films, but let's just do it in a new environment.
###438 Maybe we can get sponsorship this time.
###440 And within a week, we raised about $80,000 through Wave
###443 Rave and Burton and several other sponsors.
###446 And that was kind of when Standard Films was born.
###448 That year, we made Standard Films' first movie, "TB2--A
###451 New Way of Thinking."
###453 This season at Lake Tahoe is the season I've been waiting
###456 for all my life.
###457 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###477 TOM BURT: It turned out that most of the areas that people
###481 ride were developed by us.
###484 Almost everything was new, besides for--
###488 there's a handful of backcountry skiers who had
###489 been skiing things, but not necessarily like what we were
###493 looking for as far as steeper, more technical lines.
###497 DAVE HATCHETT: Me and Tom Burt were some of the first guys to
###499 ever jump the I-80 drop, which is a big famous drop that all
###503 the film crews race to now.
###505 It's a big 50-foot, pretty good sized drop.
###508 And all throughout the Tahoe backcountry, we definitely did
###512 several first descents, and we were certainly the first film
###514 crews to go out there and work certain areas and certain
###517 circs and ride certain lines, without a doubt.
###520 JIM RIPPEY: The Hatchetts were basically filming the kind of
###521 stuff that I wanted to ride anyway, so it fit perfectly.
###525 I like to ride freestyle and ride in the parks, but I also
###529 wanted to go to places like Alaska and get on the steep
###532 stuff that really got my adrenaline going.
###535 JEREMY JONES: They were really, at that time, defining
###539 how to shoot skiing or snowboarding in Alaska.
###544 And a lot of the stuff that they developed over those
###548 years is just kind of second nature in that whole big
###553 mountain scene.
###554 DAVE DOWNING: I mean, I saw "TB2" when it came out, and it
###557 blew me away.
###559 The whole thing blew me away-- the Alaska footage.
###561 Terry's whole part is, like, five minutes long and it's all
###564 at Squaw Valley.
###565 And it's just crazy.
###566 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###573 TRAVIS ROBB: Along the way, all those guys did something
###576 that stuck with the people and inspired them to pursue board
###581 sport culture.
###582 DAVE HATCHETT: We definitely became recognized as one of
###584 the biggest film companies in the industry for quality of
###588 cinematography and the quality of the writing.
###590 So that's something that Standard Films will always be
###593 known for, is just a really high-quality product.
###595 JEREMY JONES: Part of me is pissed off at those guys
###597 because they did hold such a high standard that it was like
###601 you could do something amazing, but you let go of
###604 your grab too early, and it's on the floor, because it
###607 wasn't just perfect.
