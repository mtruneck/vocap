###0 somebody's as senior vice president kevin brown in sotheby's isn't realistic
###4 company well underground states that as he recently two years ago sold eight
###10 an apartment in manhattan for six point five million dollars now that's not
###15 farfetched of course apartments in new york are extremely expensive
###19 the person who purchased the apartment
###21 was at chinese woman how she is identified we don't know exactly who she
###26 is admits she was purchasing the six point five million dollar apartment
###30 for her to year-old daughter
###33 of peace it does business and my wife's trainees at a two year old need we have
###37 a six point five million dollar bar in new york
###39 we do not before skepticism and we really wealthy
###44 your two-year-old needs to be able to stretch out in a nice apartment in new
###47 york city
###48 belittling kiddo why wife now wide
###51 mentioned you
###52 now kevin brown explains in detail he says i have
###55 well her daughter was going to see and go to columbia or n_y_u_ or maybe harbor
###60 and so she needed to be in the center of the city and that was why she was
###64 picking this one particular apartment
###66 so i said our college and honor and she said well see still
###70 and i was just shocked unloaded she does with specificity
###74 let's go to the columbia renoir u
###76 enhance his yet her two-year-old daughter department at
###80 i got bad news for harbored would be a telecommute
###84 that seven boston that's going to be about five hours
###87 place it's kinda fast and she went with that uh... i think it was definitely
###91 more of a real estate investment that anything else because she did purchase
###95 that apartment two years ago
###96 and a half frank's did increase significantly
###100 as i mentioned she takes six point five million dollars for it
###103 however it now costs
###105 eight point nine million dollars motorola so in essence you just made
###110 more than enough money um... on her investments you pay for her daughter's
###114 education
###116 uh... under review for graduated for a pc
###119 indeed going to do it
###121 live weather is is the most of the daughter honestly is that in china
###124 uh... there's been sp some laws passed recently
###127 where the state
###128 uh... you'd only own one property but not the i don't think that would apply
###131 here
###132 i was kisses in the u_s_ is not in china
###134 nose was a recent she wanted to years ago
###136 but i don't and bring them up because i'm not sure if there was some other
###139 tricky pretty do
###142 position for tax reasons as sarah to say that she bought it for a daughter
###146 because otherwise it's just
###147 wait to absurd now there have been some accusations as i mentioned we don't have
###151 this woman is that a lot of people are speculating and death thinking that
###155 maybe she is related to some corrupt politician in china which is why the
###159 powerful this kind of money abhe disposal
###163 and i like the smugness this you soon
###165 rooms that are two-year-old limited to an ivy league school relies on let's
###168 talk about that for a second right so let's think about hypothetical where as
###172 she's not related to some crop politician and she doesn't know people
###176 who can pull strings right
###177 and she's just a mother
###179 assumes that her daughter is going to get into one of the school speak about
###182 the amount of pressure that puts on her daughter
###185 the who donated a pressured soooo pressure anyway but what i wanna say
###190 instance that it could
###191 are backing so that's really interesting i was a ship because
###194 so uh... we have a friend uh... polyester but that's what i see
###199 his son is an absolute genius like
###201 leaving in season for the words are
###204 his accused
###205 two forty
###207 two forty is off the freakin chart and
###211 he was reading newspapers at the age of three

###254 detective so before you read this up
###256 okay and then second of all that within the constitution of the why what my
###260 two-year-old
