###15 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: We're in Nazca, Peru and we're going to
###17 show you something crazy.
###18 It's called scissor dancing.
###20 And we're going to have to go way, way off the beaten track
###22 to see it in it's true form.
###24 My co-pilot for this trip will be Anthony.
###26 Hi, buddy.
###26 What's up?
###27 How you doing?
###27 ANTHONY VERLAINE: Fine, thanks.
###28 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Let's get on the road because we got a long
###29 journey ahead of us.
###30 ANTHONY VERLAINE: Yup.
###30 Let's go.
###31 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: All right.
###31 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###48 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Oh, boy.
###49 Goodbye, pavement.
###52 Dirt roads here on in.
###54 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###62 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: So, we're lucky enough to take these
###64 dusty roads and find ourselves in Andamarca, which is a
###68 remote village in the Andes.
###69 ANTHONY VERLAINE: OK, so we're going to be in a really
###70 authentic place--
###71 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Yeah.
###72 ANTHONY VERLAINE: Not in fucking Lima.
###73 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Yeah, exactly.
###73 ANTHONY VERLAINE: Amazing.
###74 So Krishna, are we going to see scissor dancer?
###77 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Yeah, scissor dancing.
###78 ANTHONY VERLAINE: What is that?
###79 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: It's a centuries old tradition where
###81 two dancers and two musicians play.
###83 The dancers wear elaborate costumes and they hold
###86 scissors in one hand.
###87 They do really death defying sort of acts of great daring.
###93 Just sort of crazy shit.
###94 The origins of scissor dancing are kind of mysterious too.
###97 Like in the 16th century when the conquistadors came around
###101 and saw them doing these feats of strength, endurance.
###104 And they thought to themselves, man, these guys
###106 must have made a pact with the devil in order
###109 to keep this up.
###110 ANTHONY VERLAINE: Pact with the devil, cool.
###111 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Yeah.
###112 I'm actually starting to feel a little
###114 nauseous on these roads.
###116 We've been going up and down and we're
###117 like, dusty and windy--
###120 ANTHONY VERLAINE: And the altitude, like 5,000 meters
###122 height now.
###124 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: (COUGHING) Maybe that's why
###125 I'm coughing so much.
###126 
###131 We've made it to Andamarca, a tiny remote village high in
###134 the Peruvian Andes.
###136 
###140 We're at an elevation of something like 12,000 feet.
###143 The journey was arduous.
###144 And honestly, we feel like shit.
###146 I'm going to go meet our troop of scissor dancers alone
###149 because Anthony was feeling so badly that he has to lie down
###152 and take some more oxygen.
###154 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###156 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Is it a competition, the dance?
###158 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###159 
###166 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: And so we're going to collect supplies for
###168 the competition?
###169 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###172 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: So what are you going to do with the
###173 needles and the worms?
###174 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###175 
###178 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###179 
###192 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Their butts?
###193 MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.
###195 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###196 
###210 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###212 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###215 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: During our walk, the group explained that
###217 cactus needles and another sharp objects are used to
###219 prove the dancer's resistance to pain.
###222 The team that performs the most extreme feats would be
###225 deemed victorious by the town.
###227 What's the meaning of scissor dancing?
###229 What significance does it have both to your culture and to
###232 yourself personally?
###233 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###234 
###248 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###249 
###256 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: One question I've
###257 always had is why scissors?
###259 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###262 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Uh-huh.
###263 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###264 
###280 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: So all day today Anthony was in bed
###282 because he succumbed to what seemed to be altitude sickness
###286 at first, but might be something a
###287 little bit more serious.
###288 ANTHONY VERLAINE: I feel really sick because of the
###290 altitude, so our driver tries some local medicine on me.
###293 
###314 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: It's the morning of the competition.
###316 And we're headed up a hill overlooking the town so the
###318 group can practice for tonight.
###319 
###323 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###324 
###329 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###330 
###332 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###333 
###340 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: From what I understand you don't actually
###341 live in Andamarca anymore.
###343 You live in Lima.
###344 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###346 
###371 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: I can't wait.
###372 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###374 
###376 ANTHONY VERLAINE: I survived.
###379 Krishna, Krishna, Krishna.
###381 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Good to see you, buddy.
###382 How you feeling?
###383 ANTHONY VERLAINE: Better.
###383 Much better.
###383 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Good.
###384 Good.
###385 You ready to find some moves?
###386 ANTHONY VERLAINE: Definitely ready.
###387 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Awesome.
###388 That's great.
###389 How was the hospital?
###389 ANTHONY VERLAINE: Weird.
###391 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Weird.
###392 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###394 
###400 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Terrible at this.
###400 ANTHONY VERLAINE: Yeah.
###403 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###405 
###415 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Jump, go like that, jump, [INAUDIBLE]
###417 toes.
###418 Jump like that.
###419 That's going to be impossible for us.
###422 Do you want to give it a try?
###424 Here we go.
###425 ANTHONY VERLAINE: OK.
###427 
###430 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###432 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###433 
###435 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###437 
###441 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###442 
###469 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Oh, look.
###470 They're starting.
###471 Ola.
###474 Remember this song?
###474 Remember that move?
###475 ANTHONY VERLAINE: Yeah.
###476 I do remember.
###476 We almost died on it.
###479 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Yeah, we almost died doing that move.
###480 So we're here at the town square where a bunch of the
###482 towns people have gathered to watch these two teams of
###485 dancers go at it head-to-head in a series of escalating
###490 one-upsmanship kind of moves.
###492 Wow!
###494 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###512 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Wow.
###513 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###517 [APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
###520 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: It looks like they've started the
###521 second part of the competition.
###524 So we'll have our eyes out for needles, and back flips, and
###527 any kind of things that they're going to do.
###529 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###536 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Bravo!
###538 
###542 Some guy just came and whipped us a few times.
###545 ANTHONY VERLAINE: Ow!
###546 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Ow!
###546 I think we're not supposed to cross this line.
###549 But honestly, I have no idea.
###550 And the whipping had increasing--
###552 ANTHONY VERLAINE: Actually, I like it.
###553 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: You kind of liked it?
###556 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: He's going to wear it.
###558 [MUSIC PLAYING]

###606 [LAUGHTER AND CHEERING]
###611 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###622 [APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
###626 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Now they're starting to ramp this up.
###628 They're bringing out nails, knives, and other crazy stuff.
###633 Oh, boy.
###634 
###639 They're spilling their blood as a sacrifice to the Apus.
###642 In return, the mountain God relieves them of their pain.
###645 The crazier the stunt, the less pain they feel.
###647 
###650 Oh, I got to drink more booze.
###653 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###661 [APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
###666 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###669 ANTHONY VERLAINE: I'm pretty sure one of the guys is going
###671 to pass away before the end of the contest.
###674 Because they do the craziest things with their head.
###676 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###690 [APPLAUSE]
###691 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###706 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: So let's put some costumes on.
###707 Come on.

###710 
###712 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###714 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Oh, my balls.

###724 [APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
###729 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: Yeah, Anthony!
###731 
###733 [LAUGHTER AND CHEERING]
###742 KRISHNA ANDAVOLU: This is something that's off the
###743 beaten track.
###744 We had to travel through dusty roads, brave
###746 elevation, brave sickness.
###748 But we really saw scissor dancing in its purest form.
###751 And we have to really thank everyone for making us feel so
###754 at home and making us feel part of their living tradition
###757 of scissor dancing.
###758 So gracias!
