0:0:16,864 --> 0:0:19,44
MIKE HATCHETT: Dave broke his
femur in 1994, and that was


3
0:0:19,44 --> 0:0:21,83
kind of the beginning
of the end for Dave.


4
0:0:21,83 --> 0:0:24,63
And he had dabbled around
filming a little bit.


5
0:0:24,63 --> 0:0:27,16
But that next year's when he
actually, in '95, when he


6
0:0:27,16 --> 0:0:28,655
picked up a camera and actually
started shooting.


7
0:0:28,655 --> 0:0:34,634
[MUSIC PLAYING]


8
0:0:34,634 --> 0:0:36,45
DAVE HATCHETT: Definitely, the
first couple of years were


9
0:0:36,45 --> 0:0:39,17
tough behind the camera and
watching all the new riders


10
0:0:39,17 --> 0:0:39,87
ride the lines.


11
0:0:39,87 --> 0:0:42,35
And especially when one of the
rookies would blow it, I'm


12
0:0:42,35 --> 0:0:44,32
like, dude, I could
ride that thing.


13
0:0:44,32 --> 0:0:46,12
Come on.


14
0:0:46,12 --> 0:0:49,792
But at the same time, it was
kind of a relief to not be so


15
0:0:49,792 --> 0:0:51,44
putting your ass on the line.


16
0:0:51,44 --> 0:0:53,62
And the kind of riding
that I did--


17
0:0:53,62 --> 0:0:56,43
the big mountain riding and just
going fast through rock


18
0:0:56,43 --> 0:1:0,25
lines and trying to flash these
wicked chutes and rocky,


19
0:1:0,25 --> 0:1:1,57
peppery lines--


20
0:1:1,57 --> 0:1:4,154
it's a bit of a relief, for
sure, to be behind the camera.


21
0:1:4,154 --> 0:1:6,36
MIKE HATCHETT: He doesn't have
any formal experience or


22
0:1:6,36 --> 0:1:8,88
training, other than me
just saying, here's a


23
0:1:8,88 --> 0:1:11,39
camera, there you go.


24
0:1:11,39 --> 0:1:11,96
Focus.


25
0:1:11,96 --> 0:1:12,355
Composition.


26
0:1:12,355 --> 0:1:13,78
I just explained a few
things to him.


27
0:1:13,78 --> 0:1:15,595
And he just basically started
pointing and shooting.


28
0:1:15,595 --> 0:1:17,145
So that's how Dave learned.


29
0:1:17,145 --> 0:1:18,85
DAVE HATCHETT: One of my
favorite shots that I've ever


30
0:1:18,85 --> 0:1:22,19
shot of a snowboarder was Tom
Burt doing the Tom Burt Spines


31
0:1:22,19 --> 0:1:23,24
up on Donner.


32
0:1:23,24 --> 0:1:25,6
And I actually had to
rope in to film it.


33
0:1:25,6 --> 0:1:27,8
I had to use snowboards
as a belay.


34
0:1:27,8 --> 0:1:29,78
And I put a harness on it, and
I got down on this ledge.


35
0:1:29,78 --> 0:1:32,1
And I got this kind of cool shot
where I kind of panned


36
0:1:32,1 --> 0:1:34,23
the camera, and he came down,
and he fell away.


37
0:1:34,23 --> 0:1:35,0
And it just looked
really cool.


38
0:1:35,0 --> 0:1:36,2
It gave it a really
cool perspective.


39
0:1:36,2 --> 0:1:46,385
[MUSIC PLAYING]


40
0:1:46,385 --> 0:1:48,51
DAVE HATCHETT: And the line
was just incredible.


41
0:1:48,51 --> 0:1:50,29
The line had never been
snowboarded before.


42
0:1:50,29 --> 0:1:53,155
It was one of the steepest,
gnarliest spines for sure, at


43
0:1:53,155 --> 0:1:54,91
that point, that anyone
had ever done.


44
0:1:54,91 --> 0:1:57,37
And Tom greased it really well
on the snowboard, and I got


45
0:1:57,37 --> 0:1:58,52
the shot really good, too.


46
0:1:58,52 --> 0:2:0,31
So it was kind of really
satisfying to see those


47
0:2:0,31 --> 0:2:4,15
elements come together as a
team, as Tom as a rider, and


48
0:2:4,15 --> 0:2:5,99
me as a filmer.


49
0:2:5,99 --> 0:2:9,22
It was almost as satisfying as
riding it myself, although I


50
0:2:9,22 --> 0:2:10,81
don't know if I'd actually
ride that line.


51
0:2:10,81 --> 0:2:11,435
Maybe.


52
0:2:11,435 --> 0:2:15,16
JEREMY JONES: When Stanner was
shooting TB6, I was up there


53
0:2:15,16 --> 0:2:16,255
just dirtbagging it.


54
0:2:16,255 --> 0:2:19,88
And the Hatchetts saw my tracks
in the mountains and


55
0:2:19,88 --> 0:2:22,27
were like, we'd love to
look at that footage.


56
0:2:22,27 --> 0:2:25,62
They had already had TB6 pretty
darn close to cut, and


57
0:2:25,62 --> 0:2:27,27
then they got this footage and
were like, we've got to put


58
0:2:27,27 --> 0:2:28,1
this in the movie.


59
0:2:28,1 --> 0:2:49,385
[MUSIC PLAYING]


60
0:2:49,385 --> 0:2:51,95
JEREMY JONES: Still to this day,
going down to Spreckels


61
0:2:51,95 --> 0:2:55,532
Theatre in San Diego for the
premiere, I'm still like, I'm


62
0:2:55,532 --> 0:2:57,89
in there, I don't know
exactly how much.


63
0:2:57,89 --> 0:3:3,75
And then my stuff comes on at
the end of the movie, and just


64
0:3:3,75 --> 0:3:8,0
seemingly, the place erupted in
like the loudest cheer I'd


65
0:3:8,0 --> 0:3:8,56
ever heard.


66
0:3:8,56 --> 0:3:11,556
And I was shaking after that.


67
0:3:11,556 --> 0:3:13,54
It was one of the highlights
of my snowboard career.


68
0:3:13,54 --> 0:3:26,845
[MUSIC PLAYING]


69
0:3:26,845 --> 0:3:29,6
MIKE HATCHETT: We used to do all
the main world premieres


70
0:3:29,6 --> 0:3:32,21
at Spreckels Theatre.


71
0:3:32,21 --> 0:3:34,87
And look, this is the second
row totally full.


72
0:3:34,87 --> 0:3:39,21
I think it sat 1,200 people at
the time, and it was packed.


73
0:3:39,21 --> 0:3:40,29
You couldn't even stand.


74
0:3:40,29 --> 0:3:42,52
There was not a seat available
in the place.


75
0:3:42,52 --> 0:3:45,32
JEREMY JONES: Hearing all these
people who didn't know


76
0:3:45,32 --> 0:3:46,67
who I was--


77
0:3:46,67 --> 0:3:48,24
I was unheard of--


78
0:3:48,24 --> 0:3:52,68
and just a full house of one of
the loudest cheers of the


79
0:3:52,68 --> 0:3:54,763
night was a really cool thing.


80
0:3:54,763 --> 0:4:10,539



81
0:4:10,539 --> 0:4:13,55
JUSSI OKSANEN: When I grew up,
I liked Standard movies, but


82
0:4:13,55 --> 0:4:17,18
I've never really appreciated
the powder riding


83
0:4:17,18 --> 0:4:18,204
and lines and stuff.


84
0:4:18,204 --> 0:4:22,11
And the first day I went
out, I went with


85
0:4:22,11 --> 0:4:25,21
Burt and Noah Salasnek.


86
0:4:25,21 --> 0:4:30,44
And they were riding some lines
in Tahoe Donner and it


87
0:4:30,44 --> 0:4:31,165
was so humbling.


88
0:4:31,165 --> 0:4:34,42
I was just like, holy shit.


89
0:4:34,42 --> 0:4:39,9
And it just put everything in
perspective, like what those


90
0:4:39,9 --> 0:4:41,91
guys were doing and how
good they were.


91
0:4:41,91 --> 0:4:44,7
LONNIE KAUK: Michael would
always just randomly send


92
0:4:44,7 --> 0:4:46,26
these videos to my dad.


93
0:4:46,26 --> 0:4:48,28
And my dad would be like, yo,
dude, check this out.


94
0:4:48,28 --> 0:4:49,86
And I'd be like, dude,
that is the sickest


95
0:4:49,86 --> 0:4:51,13
thing I've ever seen.


96
0:4:51,13 --> 0:4:52,9
It's just so cool.


97
0:4:52,9 --> 0:4:53,75
I was like, who are
these guys?


98
0:4:53,75 --> 0:4:57,27
Like, these guys were just
shredding all the time.


99
0:4:57,27 --> 0:4:58,76
Like, that's what
I want to do.


100
0:4:58,76 --> 0:5:0,11
MIKE HATCHETT: I had heard
about Lonnie through the


101
0:5:0,11 --> 0:5:2,83
grapevine, obviously, ripping
the park in Mammoth.


102
0:5:2,83 --> 0:5:5,1
And everybody would always say,
Lonnie just laps the park


103
0:5:5,1 --> 0:5:7,63
all day to the bitter
end and just stomps


104
0:5:7,63 --> 0:5:8,67
everything, goes huge.


105
0:5:8,67 --> 0:5:12,47
And I just looked, and I could
just tell that if he was given


106
0:5:12,47 --> 0:5:15,7
the opportunity with the right
film crew and the right riders


107
0:5:15,7 --> 0:5:18,315
that he was probably going to
shine and do really well.


108
0:5:18,315 --> 0:5:26,644
[MUSIC PLAYING]


109
0:5:26,644 --> 0:5:29,9
LONNIE KAUK: There's
no future, yeah.


110
0:5:29,9 --> 0:5:31,59
But the future was just the
next day when you could go


111
0:5:31,59 --> 0:5:34,52
shred and then watching the
movies and seeing the guys.


112
0:5:34,52 --> 0:5:36,76
But then I'm like, damn,
I'm so far from this.


113
0:5:36,76 --> 0:5:38,1
And I started--


114
0:5:38,1 --> 0:5:41,785
I got a job at Mammoth,
being a janitor.


115
0:5:41,785 --> 0:5:44,71
And it's so funny, because today
was the first time I met


116
0:5:44,71 --> 0:5:45,62
Kevin Jones.


117
0:5:45,62 --> 0:5:47,99
And I was like, dude, you've
got no idea, dude.


118
0:5:47,99 --> 0:5:51,24
Last time I seen you, I was
freaking mopping the floor at


119
0:5:51,24 --> 0:5:52,84
Main Lodge, dude.


120
0:5:52,84 --> 0:5:54,15
So that's pretty sick.


121
0:5:54,15 --> 0:5:56,11
MIKE HATCHETT: I finally
decided, you know what, I


122
0:5:56,11 --> 0:5:59,8
think it's time to give Lonnie
a chance, give him a shot at


123
0:5:59,8 --> 0:6:0,39
filming with us.


124
0:6:0,39 --> 0:6:3,21
And I've always gone the extra
mile for Lonnie, because I've


125
0:6:3,21 --> 0:6:5,81
known his dad, and I've known
his upbringing in


126
0:6:5,81 --> 0:6:6,92
Yosemite and stuff.


127
0:6:6,92 --> 0:6:9,67
And I'm stoked to see
how far he's come.


128
0:6:9,67 --> 0:6:11,91
XAVIER DE LE RUE: It's like, to
be honest, growing up where


129
0:6:11,91 --> 0:6:14,71
we grew up, it's just impossible
to think about


130
0:6:14,71 --> 0:6:17,13
where we've been getting.


131
0:6:17,13 --> 0:6:19,815
And Mike definitely
helped me a lot.


132
0:6:19,815 --> 0:6:23,54
And has been basically giving
me so much opportunities.


133
0:6:23,54 --> 0:6:27,45
Like right now, my career has
just got to the next level


134
0:6:27,45 --> 0:6:29,24
because of Standard Films.


135
0:6:29,24 --> 0:6:31,92
JUSSI OKSANEN: Those guys
just worked so hard.


136
0:6:31,92 --> 0:6:34,5
And that's all I knew.


137
0:6:34,5 --> 0:6:36,635
So I just went with the flow,
because I didn't really speak


138
0:6:36,635 --> 0:6:38,2
English or anything.


139
0:6:38,2 --> 0:6:39,73
I really wanted to work,
but I was just kind


140
0:6:39,73 --> 0:6:41,69
of out of my element.


141
0:6:41,69 --> 0:6:44,94
And then being in the
backcountry too, that was--


142
0:6:44,94 --> 0:6:48,42
I've never ridden powder before,
really, that year.


143
0:6:48,42 --> 0:6:51,6
TIM MANNING: Off the resort is
a whole other situation.


144
0:6:51,6 --> 0:6:55,54
So we sometimes called it
snowboard film tryouts,


145
0:6:55,54 --> 0:6:58,41
because we'd take a crew of guys
in the backcountry for


146
0:6:58,41 --> 0:7:1,61
their first time and try to
survive throughout the day.


147
0:7:1,61 --> 0:7:5,78
Keep them away from cornices,
keep them away from dangerous


148
0:7:5,78 --> 0:7:8,2
situations that they had
no idea what they


149
0:7:8,2 --> 0:7:9,37
were involved with.


150
0:7:9,37 --> 0:7:12,62
But we knew that if we could
just get them to these jumps


151
0:7:12,62 --> 0:7:16,6
that we wanted to build, it was
a fairly safe situation.


152
0:7:16,6 --> 0:7:17,54
And then they could
do their stuff.


153
0:7:17,54 --> 0:7:20,98
JEREMY JONES: The Hatchett
brothers are incredible


154
0:7:20,98 --> 0:7:24,4
teachers of everything
to do with filming.


155
0:7:24,4 --> 0:7:27,715
So these riders that come up--


156
0:7:27,715 --> 0:7:31,47
Jussi Oksanen and Kevin
Jones, you name it--


157
0:7:31,47 --> 0:7:34,84
they showed these guys where to
build jumps, how to build


158
0:7:34,84 --> 0:7:40,3
jumps, just doing everything
they could to help everyone to


159
0:7:40,3 --> 0:7:42,93
go into the mountains safely
and ride cool stuff.


160
0:7:42,93 --> 0:7:54,834



161
0:7:54,834 --> 0:7:59,345
CHAS GULDEMOND: Obviously, the
TB series was amazing.


162
0:7:59,345 --> 0:8:3,17
All those older guys just
murdered it, and we're still


163
0:8:3,17 --> 0:8:6,22
trying to live up to
what they did then.


164
0:8:6,22 --> 0:8:9,69
But now, kind of in our own way,
spinning like maniacs and


165
0:8:9,69 --> 0:8:12,97
hitting big park jumps, and
it's kind of crazy.


166
0:8:12,97 --> 0:8:17,59
But I'm pretty stoked to be part
of this generation, as


167
0:8:17,59 --> 0:8:19,83
well as jealous to not
be in the generation


168
0:8:19,83 --> 0:8:22,175
of all those dudes.


169
0:8:22,175 --> 0:8:26,64
MIKE HATCHETT: TB4 to 6 was when
the pendulum just swang,


170
0:8:26,64 --> 0:8:28,84
and the video sales were going
through the ceiling,


171
0:8:28,84 --> 0:8:32,0
sponsorships were up, all the
riders were getting paid good.


172
0:8:32,0 --> 0:8:32,799
And it was just like, yeah.


173
0:8:32,799 --> 0:8:35,51
It was just all of a sudden
like, yeah, I can buy a house


174
0:8:35,51 --> 0:8:37,77
now, I can make a living
off of this.


175
0:8:37,77 --> 0:8:40,57
And that lasted until like
2010, and then it slowly


176
0:8:40,57 --> 0:8:42,1
started tapering off.


177
0:8:42,1 --> 0:8:44,59
And now, it's just a completely


178
0:8:44,59 --> 0:8:44,69
different ball game.


179
0:8:44,69 --> 0:8:47,24
Now, you just really don't make
that much of money making


180
0:8:47,24 --> 0:8:47,92
a snowboard video.


181
0:8:47,92 --> 0:8:52,46
And I never got into it to make
money, so I don't feel


182
0:8:52,46 --> 0:8:52,95
much different.


183
0:8:52,95 --> 0:8:54,69
I got into it because I like
to make movies, and I like


184
0:8:54,69 --> 0:8:55,44
snowboarding.


185
0:8:55,44 --> 0:8:58,61
So the money thing's
never really--


186
0:8:58,61 --> 0:9:0,63
it was great when it was there,
and we made good cash.


187
0:9:0,63 --> 0:9:2,34
And I saved some of it
and then lost it all.


188
0:9:2,34 --> 0:9:4,4
And now I--


189
0:9:4,4 --> 0:9:6,47
it's like making TB2 again--


190
0:9:6,47 --> 0:9:8,16
broke and making a video.


191
0:9:8,16 --> 0:9:9,41
But it still feels good.


192
0:9:9,41 --> 0:11:9,41
