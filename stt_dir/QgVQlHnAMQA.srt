out of the shot.


3
0:0:3,475 --> 0:0:6,33



4
0:0:6,33 --> 0:0:7,41
Vice, we need a wrangler
on the next one.


5
0:0:7,41 --> 0:0:9,8
We need a camera C.


6
0:0:9,8 --> 0:0:12,36
We need a wrangler, what else?


7
0:0:12,36 --> 0:0:14,44

8
0:0:14,44 --> 0:0:16,51

0:0:16,51 --> 0:0:18,73
Oh, Escalades with the scooters
attached on the


10
0:0:18,73 --> 0:0:21,1
sides, like some on Batman
and Robin shit.


11
0:0:21,1 --> 0:0:22,97
No, I'm just fucking around,
because we don't even need


12
0:0:22,97 --> 0:0:25,8
this footage, in case I say
something funny, dude.


13
0:0:25,8 --> 0:0:29,91
I mean, it could happen
sometime, fucking dickhead.


14

DAVID: I would like to hear,
though, like, we came here and


15
0:0:32,9 --> 0:0:32,84
we have to--


16
0:0:32,84 --> 0:0:34,635
EDDIE HUANG: Why don't you
just host the show?


17
0:0:34,635 --> 0:0:36,48
Like, instead of telling
me to say what you


18
0:0:36,48 --> 0:0:39,2
would like to hear--


19
0:0:39,2 --> 0:0:41,18
DAVID: Let's go.


20
0:0:41,18 --> 0:0:45,18
Right so we came all the way
to Taiwan, and I just think


21
0:0:45,18 --> 0:0:47,42
that you can't come here without
eating stinky tofu.


22
0:0:47,42 --> 0:0:48,99
It's something I grew up
with when I was a kid.


23
0:0:48,99 --> 0:0:50,39
It's something you don't
have in the States.


24
0:0:50,39 --> 0:0:52,3
You probably don't really
know anything about it.


25
0:0:52,3 --> 0:0:53,985
It's something that is very,
very specific and


26
0:0:53,985 --> 0:0:54,55
official for me.


27
0:0:54,55 --> 0:0:57,222
So I think right now we're
going to go try that.


28
0:0:57,222 --> 0:0:58,904
EDDIE HUANG: Official!

[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]


31
0:1:25,32 --> 0:1:36,94



32
0:1:36,94 --> 0:1:41,29
Shen Keng is originally not
known just for its stank tofu,


33
0:1:41,29 --> 0:1:43,39
but it's known for
tofu in general.


34
0:1:43,39 --> 0:1:46,165
Because the water has
a flavor of coal.


35
0:1:46,165 --> 0:1:47,98
It has the essence of coal.


36
0:1:47,98 --> 0:1:52,63
So it gives it a little kind of
smokey charcoal flavor in


37
0:1:52,63 --> 0:1:54,87
the food, especially
the tofu that they


38
0:1:54,87 --> 0:1:55,92
make with this water.


39
0:1:55,92 --> 0:1:57,21
So it's called stinky tofu.


40
0:1:57,21 --> 0:1:58,2
I call it stank tofu.


41
0:1:58,2 --> 0:2:0,82
But proper is stinky
tofu, chou doufu.


42
0:2:0,82 --> 0:2:5,26



43
0:2:5,26 --> 0:2:7,96
So watch what happens when
I press down on this.


44
0:2:7,96 --> 0:2:9,419
Look how tender this tofu is.


45
0:2:9,419 --> 0:2:10,72
Look at that.


46
0:2:10,72 --> 0:2:14,41
That tofu is silky, dude,
it just falls out.


47
0:2:14,41 --> 0:2:16,44
For anyone that's like, I don't
like tofu, I don't eat


48
0:2:16,44 --> 0:2:18,99
tofu, I beg you, look at this.


49
0:2:18,99 --> 0:2:20,14
Taste this.


50
0:2:20,14 --> 0:2:23,91
When you have good tofu, it can
take on the flavor of coal


51
0:2:23,91 --> 0:2:25,1
through the water.


52
0:2:25,1 --> 0:2:25,82
It has leather.


53
0:2:25,82 --> 0:2:27,1
It has tannins.


54
0:2:27,1 --> 0:2:31,83
It has umami that you can't even
get in animal proteins.


55
0:2:31,83 --> 0:2:32,39
Right?


56
0:2:32,39 --> 0:2:35,74
And tofu, you can do dishes that
let the essence of the


57
0:2:35,74 --> 0:2:38,71
tofu speak for itself,
like this one.


58
0:2:38,71 --> 0:2:42,69
And it's just a touch of lard
and some shallot soup, right.


59
0:2:42,69 --> 0:2:46,11
You could have this one, where
you get the very stinky tofu,


60
0:2:46,11 --> 0:2:51,5
and you combat it with sesame
oil, sugar, rice wine, soy,


61
0:2:51,5 --> 0:2:52,93
basil, and garlic.


62
0:2:52,93 --> 0:2:55,56
Give it the aromatics, and
ginger, and they come together


63
0:2:55,56 --> 0:2:56,97
for a very deep,
powerful dish.


64
0:2:56,97 --> 0:2:58,88
You could do a coal.


65
0:2:58,88 --> 0:3:1,23
And this is regular flavored
silken tofu.


66
0:3:1,23 --> 0:3:3,22
This took on the flavor
of the tea.


67
0:3:3,22 --> 0:3:5,43
What this dish is showcasing
is the tea.


68
0:3:5,43 --> 0:3:6,96
And the funkiness is
coming from the


69
0:3:6,96 --> 0:3:7,84
thousand year old egg.


70
0:3:7,84 --> 0:3:11,9
So this is just cooking
science, right?


71
0:3:11,9 --> 0:3:12,15
I love this.


72
0:3:12,15 --> 0:3:15,53
Because every dish has to
have these elements.


73
0:3:15,53 --> 0:3:18,84
But they're choosing which
vehicle to bring those


74
0:3:18,84 --> 0:3:19,6
elements out.


75
0:3:19,6 --> 0:3:23,19
They're choosing which ones
to showcase in every dish.


76
0:3:23,19 --> 0:3:25,92
And it's fucking amazing how
this entire restaurant is


77
0:3:25,92 --> 0:3:26,99
specializing in tofu.


78
0:3:26,99 --> 0:3:30,26
And they're just firing on all
cylinders and showing you the


79
0:3:30,26 --> 0:3:31,2
versatility.


80
0:3:31,2 --> 0:3:33,14
It's really fucking cool.


81
0:3:33,14 --> 0:3:35,6
It's like the Randall Cunningham
tofu restaurant.


82
0:3:35,6 --> 0:3:36,99
There's not one way to
play quarterback.


83
0:3:36,99 --> 0:3:38,1
There's not one way to cook.


84
0:3:38,1 --> 0:3:39,3
There's not one way
to eat tofu.


85
0:3:39,3 --> 0:3:41,22
And this is living proof, man.


86
0:3:41,22 --> 0:3:42,554
This is fucking on fire.


87
0:3:42,554 --> 0:3:46,56



88
0:3:46,56 --> 0:3:58,3



89
0:3:58,3 --> 0:3:59,71
-How did that happen?


90
0:3:59,71 --> 0:4:2,53



91
0:4:2,53 --> 0:4:4,44
EDDIE HUANG: So this
is called gua sha.


92
0:4:4,44 --> 0:4:5,85
And he's scraping me.


93
0:4:5,85 --> 0:4:8,23
Gua sha is kind of a
diagnostic step.


94
0:4:8,23 --> 0:4:11,69
When you gua sha, it will show
you where the injuries are in


95
0:4:11,69 --> 0:4:14,97
your body, and where there's
issues with your muscles or


96
0:4:14,97 --> 0:4:18,19
nerves or pressure points.


97
0:4:18,19 --> 0:4:19,589
Like this one hurts a lot.


98
0:4:19,589 --> 0:4:23,21
And then he will target
those areas.


99
0:4:23,21 --> 0:4:26,43
Doing the ba guan is very, very
good for relieving the


100
0:4:26,43 --> 0:4:29,39
pressure in your pressure
points, circulation.


101
0:4:29,39 --> 0:4:33,15
And also, that's how your body
has healing, is blood brings


102
0:4:33,15 --> 0:4:34,67
the nutrients.


103
0:4:34,67 --> 0:4:36,8
And blood circulation health
with all sorts


104
0:4:36,8 --> 0:4:38,41
of healing and immunity.


105
0:4:38,41 --> 0:4:42,41
So if you have a cold, if you
have the flu, headache, this


106
0:4:42,41 --> 0:4:44,795
is a very good thing
to come do.


107
0:4:44,795 --> 0:4:58,15



108
0:4:58,15 --> 0:5:8,34



109
0:5:8,34 --> 0:5:10,92
EDDIE HUANG: Shorty at home, you
know who you are, the kids


110
0:5:10,92 --> 0:5:13,77
going to be sleeping
like this.


111
0:5:13,77 --> 0:5:14,95
I've had MRIs.


112
0:5:14,95 --> 0:5:16,96
I've had x-rays and
things like that.


113
0:5:16,96 --> 0:5:21,87
This guy, just by using this
instrument and gua sha, he was


114
0:5:21,87 --> 0:5:24,43
able to see things that
cost thousands of


115
0:5:24,43 --> 0:5:26,4
dollars on the MRI x-ray.


116
0:5:26,4 --> 0:5:28,88
And he also gave me the added
bonus telling me that's what's


117
0:5:28,88 --> 0:5:31,13
affecting my stomach
and intestines.


118
0:5:31,13 --> 0:5:33,1
Now, I want viewers to know
this is not voodoo.


119
0:5:33,1 --> 0:5:34,44
This is not some cult.


120
0:5:34,44 --> 0:5:39,27
This is thousands, 5,000 years
of Eastern medicine.


121
0:5:39,27 --> 0:5:41,38
And it's not better than
Western medicine.


122
0:5:41,38 --> 0:5:43,41
They are very good used
in conjunction.


123
0:5:43,41 --> 0:5:56,19



124
0:5:56,19 --> 0:6:0,815



125
0:6:0,815 --> 0:6:4,34



126
0:6:4,34 --> 0:6:7,98
EDDIE HUANG: So the first step
in a tea ceremony, pour hot


127
0:6:7,98 --> 0:6:9,22
water over your teapot.


128
0:6:9,22 --> 0:6:12,9
The reason he's getting it hot
is because the clay will react


129
0:6:12,9 --> 0:6:12,87
to the heat.


130
0:6:12,87 --> 0:6:14,91
So that's the amount of tea that
you would put into a pot


131
0:6:14,91 --> 0:6:17,8
like, about one fifth.


132
0:6:17,8 --> 0:6:19,59
He poured in 100 degrees
Celsius boiling


133
0:6:19,59 --> 0:6:20,96
water into the pot.


134
0:6:20,96 --> 0:6:23,72
Then he let it sit like
maybe two seconds, and


135
0:6:23,72 --> 0:6:24,59
then dumped it off.


136
0:6:24,59 --> 0:6:27,69
So a lot of the things we do,
whether it's cooking, whether


137
0:6:27,69 --> 0:6:30,28
it's drinking tea, you
throw out the first.


138
0:6:30,28 --> 0:6:33,2
And you see how he is constantly
seasoning his pots


139
0:6:33,2 --> 0:6:34,94
with the first that
he's throwing out?


140
0:6:34,94 --> 0:6:36,32
He's pouring the tea
over the pots.


141
0:6:36,32 --> 0:6:37,38
He's seasoning them.


142
0:6:37,38 --> 0:6:40,99
And it's that overflow with the
100 degrees Celsius water,


143
0:6:40,99 --> 0:6:43,13
push it down, and then
let it hang out.


144
0:6:43,13 --> 0:6:48,59



145
0:6:48,59 --> 0:6:51,22
And you see the color of it,
it's like light golden color.


146
0:6:51,22 --> 0:6:59,99



147
0:6:59,99 --> 0:7:14,91



148
0:7:14,91 --> 0:7:17,75
EDDIE HUANG: Just like you'd
smell the nose on a wine.


149
0:7:17,75 --> 0:7:27,21



150
0:7:27,21 --> 0:7:32,61



151
0:7:32,61 --> 0:7:35,88
Before we left Taiwan,
I had to take you to


152
0:7:35,88 --> 0:7:38,5
[FOREIGN LANGUAGE],
Old Street.


153
0:7:38,5 --> 0:7:42,34
And not to be nostalgic about
the past, or not to be like,


154
0:7:42,34 --> 0:7:45,37
it was better back then, or
be really somber about it.


155
0:7:45,37 --> 0:7:49,33
But just to show you this is
a 5,000 year old culture.


156
0:7:49,33 --> 0:7:51,55
The medicine is different.


157
0:7:51,55 --> 0:7:53,45
We have a different
way of life.


158
0:7:53,45 --> 0:7:54,75
And it's not better.


159
0:7:54,75 --> 0:7:55,2
It's not worse.


160
0:7:55,2 --> 0:7:56,76
It's just what it is.


161
0:7:56,76 --> 0:8:0,35
And then lastly I wanted to show
you how tea, in a lot of


162
0:8:0,35 --> 0:8:3,7
ways, is similar to wine,
and how stinky tofu


163
0:8:3,7 --> 0:8:4,38
is similar to cheese.


164
0:8:4,38 --> 0:8:7,97
If there's one thing to learn
from "Fresh Off the Boat" it's


165
0:8:7,97 --> 0:8:10,725
no culture is better or
worse than another.


166
0:8:10,725 --> 0:8:13,43



167
