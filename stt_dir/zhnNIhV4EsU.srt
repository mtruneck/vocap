relying on them to detect
bombs being


404
0:22:16,12 --> 0:22:17,93
brought into Baghdad.


405
0:22:17,93 --> 0:22:20,648
No wonder so many people
were getting killed.

408
0:22:35,62 --> 0:22:37,89
SUROOSH ALVI: Now, with these
units being sold to the Iraqis


409
0:22:37,89 --> 0:22:41,12
at up to $60,000 each,
you'd expect a


410
0:22:41,12 --> 0:22:42,74
little production value.


411
0:22:42,74 --> 0:22:46,12
But instead, they're a cheap
piece of plastic with an AM/FM


412
0:22:46,12 --> 0:22:49,28
radio antenna on it and
no power supply.


413
0:22:49,28 --> 0:22:52,17
The cards they speak of, the
ones that supposedly calibrate


414
0:22:52,17 --> 0:22:55,58
the device to detect different
types of explosives, are


415
0:22:55,58 --> 0:22:58,6
little more than business
cards with words like C4


416
0:22:58,6 --> 0:22:59,74
written on them.

0:23:0,99 --> 0:23:19,11



419
0:23:19,11 --> 0:23:21,8
SUROOSH ALVI: The wands are
the invention of Jim


420
0:23:21,8 --> 0:23:24,3
McCormick, a British businessman
who sold them to


421
0:23:24,3 --> 0:23:27,37
the Iraqi government for
a total of $85 million,


422
0:23:27,37 --> 0:23:29,63
promising that they
would save lives.


423
0:23:29,63 --> 0:23:31,83
But what they did was
the exact opposite.


424
0:23:31,83 --> 0:23:34,67
They allowed bombs to slip past
checkpoints, while making


425
0:23:34,67 --> 0:23:35,945
McCormick rich.


426
0:23:35,945 --> 0:23:39,19
But the most insane part of the
story is that, in spite of


427
0:23:39,19 --> 0:23:42,71
the obvious uselessness of the
device, and in spite of the


428
0:23:42,71 --> 0:23:46,3
arrest and trial of Jim
McCormick, the Iraqi military


429
0:23:46,3 --> 0:23:48,85
and police are still
using them at every


430
0:23:48,85 --> 0:23:50,277
checkpoint in the city.

SUROOSH ALVI: With our time in
Baghdad drawing to a close, we


436
0:24:41,13 --> 0:24:42,755
headed back to Waleed's place.


437
0:24:42,755 --> 0:24:44,76
We wanted to see how he
was dealing about the


438
0:24:44,76 --> 0:24:47,45
home he left behind.


439
0:24:47,45 --> 0:24:49,42
WALEED NESYIF: The electricity's
coming back.


440
0:24:49,42 --> 0:24:50,24
SUROOSH ALVI: Generator's
kicking in.


441
0:24:50,24 --> 0:24:50,91
WALEED NESYIF: Yeah.


442
0:24:50,91 --> 0:24:53,61
So my family has, basically,
three lines right now-- two


443
0:24:53,61 --> 0:24:56,45
generators and one governmental
line.


444
0:24:56,45 --> 0:24:56,83
SUROOSH ALVI: Yeah.


445
0:24:56,83 --> 0:24:58,57
WALEED NESYIF: So whenever
one goes off, the


446
0:24:58,57 --> 0:24:59,42
other one kicks in--


447
0:24:59,42 --> 0:25:0,3
SUROOSH ALVI: That's good.


448
0:25:0,3 --> 0:25:0,7
WALEED NESYIF: --and
so on and so forth.


449
0:25:0,7 --> 0:25:2,7
SUROOSH ALVI: So they have
electricity around the clock.


450
0:25:2,7 --> 0:25:7,37
So what was it like for you to
come home after eight years?


451
0:25:7,37 --> 0:25:9,7
WALEED NESYIF: The difference
which between eight years ago


452
0:25:9,7 --> 0:25:10,97
and now, it's titanic.


453
0:25:10,97 --> 0:25:16,27
The city is in this complete
state of sterile living.


454
0:25:16,27 --> 0:25:19,16
Everybody's trying to
keep it together,


455
0:25:19,16 --> 0:25:21,48
but nothing is together.


456
0:25:21,48 --> 0:25:26,6
I don't think Iraq found its
comfortable middle ground yet,


457
0:25:26,6 --> 0:25:29,87
because the city still exists
within two extremes.


458
0:25:29,87 --> 0:25:33,99
You have the religious massive
extreme, and then you have the


459
0:25:33,99 --> 0:25:37,79
other wanting to be westernized
without really


460
0:25:37,79 --> 0:25:41,24
understanding what
westernism is.


461
0:25:41,24 --> 0:25:42,75
SUROOSH ALVI: So what is your
family telling you now that


462
0:25:42,75 --> 0:25:43,88
you're here?


463
0:25:43,88 --> 0:25:45,55
What's it like for them?


464
0:25:45,55 --> 0:25:47,43
WALEED NESYIF: They're
praying for the days


465
0:25:47,43 --> 0:25:49,96
of Saddam to return.


466
0:25:49,96 --> 0:25:54,76
In 1991, America came and
destroyed literally 75% of


467
0:25:54,76 --> 0:25:57,69
Iraqi infrastructure and
all of the cities.


468
0:25:57,69 --> 0:25:58,99
It was all destroyed,
completely.


469
0:25:58,99 --> 0:26:0,2
SUROOSH ALVI: Yeah.


470
0:26:0,2 --> 0:26:2,45
WALEED NESYIF: Saddam restored
everything within six months.


471
0:26:2,45 --> 0:26:4,59
People started saying, it was
like, well, if Saddam was able


472
0:26:4,59 --> 0:26:6,25
to do it during the section--


473
0:26:6,25 --> 0:26:7,32
and he nothing, really.


474
0:26:7,32 --> 0:26:9,86
The country had just come
out of a major war.


475
0:26:9,86 --> 0:26:13,11
Why is America incapable
of doing the same?


476
0:26:13,11 --> 0:26:16,11
The worst thing America
has done to Iraq


477
0:26:16,11 --> 0:26:18,17
and Iraqis is this.


478
0:26:18,17 --> 0:26:25,36
They made a dictator look like
an angel in comparison to what


479
0:26:25,36 --> 0:26:28,12
we have right now.


480
0:26:28,12 --> 0:26:30,76
SUROOSH ALVI: And that's what
America accomplished.


481
0:26:30,76 --> 0:26:32,46
They made Saddam look good.


482
0:26:32,46 --> 0:26:35,12



483
0:26:35,12 --> 0:26:36,86
Nostalgia is a powerful thing.


484
0:26:36,86 --> 0:26:40,38
It can make the past seem better
in the present, even


485
0:26:40,38 --> 0:26:44,3
when that past was ruled over by
a tyrant who murdered those


486
0:26:44,3 --> 0:26:46,95
who opposed him and treated
the majority of Iraq's


487
0:26:46,95 --> 0:26:51,62
population, the Shia, like
second class citizens.


488
0:26:51,62 --> 0:26:54,53
For all of America's efforts,
for the billions of dollars


489
0:26:54,53 --> 0:26:59,9
spent and more than a million
lives lost, today Iraq is


490
0:26:59,9 --> 0:27:1,48
looking to the past instead
of the future.
