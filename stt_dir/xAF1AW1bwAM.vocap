###13 SIMON OSTROVSKY: We'd finally arrived at the Havat Gilad
###15 outpost in the West Bank, which is home to some of the
###18 most hardcore settlers.
###20 This was a community that was prepared to live at the top of
###23 a hill in the Palestinian territories, in defiance of
###26 both international and Israeli law.
###30 There to tell us about their lives were Simcha and Yosef, a
###33 pair of teenagers who are busy doing what settlers in the
###36 area did best--
###37 building a house without a permit.
###41 When they hear somebody say the West Bank, they think that
###44 it's a war zone, it's dangerous.
###46 You're living right next door to Arabic villages.
###49 Are you fearful for your own safety, moving out here?
###52 There's no fence around the settlement at all.
###54 You're kind of exposed.
###55 SIMCHA: I don't feel any--
###57 like I'm afraid.
###58 I have God here.
###62 Yeah.
###63 
###66 You getting used to it.
###68 SIMON OSTROVSKY: But you can even hear the call to prayer
###70 going now from the nearby Arabic town.
###74 SIMCHA: Actually annoying.
###76 SIMON OSTROVSKY: Simcha didn't seem to have much sympathy for
###79 his Palestinian neighbors or their culture.
###81 But then again, he was kind of pissed because a couple of
###84 weeks ago they'd apparently burned down a house he'd
###86 helped build, and killed his dog.
###91 SIMCHA: Came in the morning, and they saw nobody here.
###93 And then came two guys and just burned the house.
###96 So after, all of our guys, they went to the village and
###100 start fighting there, and it was a big mess, yeah.
###106 SIMCHA: From our guys?
###107 No.
###109 SIMCHA: I think so.
###112 
###115 SIMCHA: Yeah, probably they're afraid.
###120 SIMCHA: We don't meet girls.
###122 That's one of the problems.
###123 
###127 SIMCHA: Lonely?
###128 No, I never get lonely.
###131 [HAMMERING]
###134 [GUITAR STRUMMING]
###160 SIMON OSTROVSKY: So you're going to start
###160 a settlement band?
###162 SIMCHA: Yeah.
###163 We're going to just make Jewish blues, some kind of
###167 something like that.
###168 
###171 SIMCHA: Kind of.
###172 
###175 SIMCHA: Ah, yeah.
###177 
###187 SIMON OSTROVSKY: Simcha struck me as an oddly-normal teen for
###190 someone who is taking part in a blatant land grab.
###193 But the settlers don't see it that way.
###195 In their view, God had promised the Jews this land.
###199 End of story.
###200 [SPEAKING HEBREW]
###215 SIMON OSTROVSKY: What do you think the Arabs want?
###216 [SPEAKING HEBREW]
###250 SIMON OSTROVSKY: Does it make you angry that most of the
###252 international community agrees with the Palestinians in that
###255 you shouldn't be in the West Bank?
###257 [SPEAKING HEBREW]
###270 SIMON OSTROVSKY: Have you personally had any problems
###272 with Israeli police?
###274 [SPEAKING HEBREW]
###280 SIMON OSTROVSKY: Simcha and I left Yosef to do some
###282 construction while we took a stroll around the settlement.
###285 I suppose if you do like everybody else here, you have
###288 to start your own family soon.
###291 SIMCHA: Yeah.
###291 SIMON OSTROVSKY: But you also have to go to the military, so
###293 how do you do both?
###294 SIMCHA: I do military and I'm done.
###298 SIMON OSTROVSKY: But you want to go to the army?
###300 SIMCHA: Yeah, I want to go the army, yeah.
###302 SIMON OSTROVSKY: Can you imagine a situation where
###303 you'd be part of a unit that was ordered to provide
###306 security for a demolition?
###308 SIMCHA: Never.
###309 
###311 No.
###312 SIMON OSTROVSKY: What about the demolition of a
###314 Palestinian's house?
###317 SIMCHA: I'll be happy to do it.
###319 That will be my dream.
###323 SIMON OSTROVSKY: Simcha introduced me to Yair, a
###325 19-year-old who was about to enlist in the army.
###328 Yair's house had recently been destroyed by the police, and
###331 he seemed even more vocally opinionated than both Yosef
###334 and Simcha.
###335 I wonder if you tried to look at it from the perspective of
###339 the Palestinians.
###341 Their fathers were here, their grandfathers were here, and
###343 their great-great-grandfathers were here.
###345 They don't know any other country.
###347 YAIR: They do.
###347 SIMON OSTROVSKY: They might say, where are
###348 we supposed to go?
###349 YAIR: You know how many countries have Arab
###352 [INAUDIBLE]?
###352 22.
###354 We have one.
###356 And now we have half of it.
###358 Not even all of it.
###359 And the little piece we have, they want to
###361 steal from us again.
###363 SIMON OSTROVSKY: Would be really stupid of me to say
###365 that the Canaanites were here before Israel?
###368 Maybe their descendants can claim to have
###371 more rights than Jews.
###372 YAIR: You see the Canaanites now?
###374 You see them anywhere?
###376 SIMON OSTROVSKY: No, I'm just trying to make a point that
###378 history moves in many places, and many different ways.
###381 YAIR: History moves.
###382 Again, the Jewish people didn't move a millimeter.
###385 SIMON OSTROVSKY: But even Israel says
###386 this isn't your property.
###388 YAIR: I feel sorry for the government that they feel that
###393 they still, in Poland and Germany.
###395 And they think, oy, Obama.
###398 Oy, we are afraid of Obama.
###400 We are afraid of all the rest of the world.
###402 We are not in 1945 anymore.
###403 That's it.
###404 No Jew is going into the burning places anymore.
###407 That's it.
###408 Finish.
###409 Done.
###409 SIMON OSTROVSKY: Is it true that settlers sometimes attack
###411 a Palestinian village as a reprisal against the Israeli
###414 police destroying a settler's house?
###417 YAIR: Uh, I heard about those things, but as a settler, I
###423 never did that.
###423 I never saw that.
###424 I have no idea what they're speaking about.
###427 I believe that it's a manipulation of the media.
###430 Every media guy has a agenda.
###433 My father always says that the only true thing in the
###436 newspaper is the date.
###437 That's it.
###439 This is my ideology.
###440 This is what I believe in.
###441 I believe that the Israeli people should
###443 live anywhere in Israel.
###448 SIMON OSTROVSKY: I headed back to meet with Simcha and Yosef,
###450 who'd taken a break from construction, and were
###453 ordering a pizza from a nearby settlement called Kedumim.
###457 The goal for Havat Gilad and Kedumim is to eventually merge
###460 and form a settlement block, which would, in turn, separate
###463 the Palestinian villages on either side of it.
###466 In the meantime, I headed back to Tel Aviv across the Green
###470 Line, and into Israel proper.
###472 
###475 [SIREN]
###478 SIMON OSTROVSKY: There's tons of soldiers and police here
###480 today because they're expecting a confrontation with
###484 the Palestinian demonstrators.
