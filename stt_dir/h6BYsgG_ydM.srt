'If I get promoted to loan
supervisor, that's an extra 160 a month.


2
0:0:31,107 --> 0:0:33,467
'Four months, weekend in Zurich.


3
0:0:33,467 --> 0:0:38,387
'Lf I get it. I should've ironed my...
Why didn't I iron my fucking tie? '


4
0:0:38,387 --> 0:0:42,547
- Mark, I thought you'd be out by now.
- Nope, not out yet.


5
0:0:42,547 --> 0:0:44,347
Haven't been in yet.


6
0:0:44,347 --> 0:0:49,627
- 'Lovely soft face. '
- It's just Barbara and Lucy. Relax.


7
0:0:49,627 --> 0:0:54,987
You're right. Totally right.
I'll laugh. Have a nice laugh.


8
0:0:54,987 --> 0:0:58,347
Will Jeff's charity squash stuff
count for much?


9
0:0:58,347 --> 0:1:3,27
Mark, it'll be fine. I'm sure you'll get it.


10
0:1:3,27 --> 0:1:5,107
'Ohh... '


11
0:1:5,107 --> 0:1:8,347
Sophie, have you ever been to Zurich?


12
0:1:8,347 --> 0:1:10,467
- What?
- 'Too much. Too much! '


13
0:1:10,467 --> 0:1:13,507
Very clean, apparently. Ruthlessly clean.


14
0:1:13,507 --> 0:1:17,67
Talking of which, badminton.
Still on for Wednesday?


15
0:1:17,67 --> 0:1:19,787
- Yep.
- I was thinking, afterwards...


16
0:1:19,787 --> 0:1:24,107
Hi, Sophie. Hey, fuckface, you're on.


17
0:1:24,107 --> 0:1:31,107
'Forget it, mate, you're dead in the water.
I'm gonna be relaxing all over you. '


18
0:1:31,107 --> 0:1:33,227
Welcome to my world.


19
0:1:33,227 --> 0:1:35,627
Man, I am so glad you got me in here.


20
0:1:35,627 --> 0:1:37,787
Nice.


21
0:1:37,787 --> 0:1:42,627
Wicked. So let's go down to the studio
and start riffing on some shit.


22
0:1:42,627 --> 0:1:48,587
Totally, yeah. Although obviously one of
us must be on reception at any one time.


23
0:1:48,587 --> 0:1:53,307
- That's important.
- OK, I get it. The code, right?


24
0:1:53,307 --> 0:1:58,667
We bide our time and pick our moment
to really shake shit up and get noticed.


25
0:1:58,667 --> 0:2:1,787
Yeah. Although
the best way to get noticed


26
0:2:1,787 --> 0:2:6,227
is to pick up a four-pinter on the way in,
ask Ron if he wants a latte...


27
0:2:6,227 --> 0:2:9,587
Jesus, what happened?
You've got a Blair Witch ear!


28
0:2:9,587 --> 0:2:14,187
Oh. Yeah, that's Toni's.
You know, next-door Toni?


29
0:2:14,187 --> 0:2:19,547
Oh, the one you wrote, er -
- Toni's Theme for?


30
0:2:19,547 --> 0:2:21,587
She's like some kind of drug.


31
0:2:21,587 --> 0:2:25,227
Kind of like ketamine but...
with nicer hair.


32
0:2:25,227 --> 0:2:31,907
So, you're all set, ain't you? You are
a music studio reception runner now.


33
0:2:31,907 --> 0:2:34,467
- Gets the women hot.
- Yeah?


34
0:2:34,467 --> 0:2:39,907
Oh, yeah. It's a savage garden, my friend.
A savage garden.


35
0:2:39,907 --> 0:2:43,307
'Shall I ask what he means? '


36
0:2:43,307 --> 0:2:46,67
'The interview went really well.


37
0:2:46,67 --> 0:2:50,587
'Glad I didn't mention the phones.
Keep the big idea on ice for now.


38
0:2:50,587 --> 0:2:53,667
'Maybe should've mentioned
the blind kids.


39
0:2:53,667 --> 0:2:58,67
'Although it could've sounded like
I just did it for my CV.'


40
0:2:58,67 --> 0:3:0,307
- Mark?
- Hey, Sophie.


41
0:3:0,307 --> 0:3:2,907
Barbara said to tell you there's news.


42
0:3:2,907 --> 0:3:6,267
- What... They didn't give it to Jeff?
- No, they didn't.


43
0:3:6,267 --> 0:3:9,107
Yes!


44
0:3:9,107 --> 0:3:11,947
No. Mark, let me... Sit down.


45
0:3:11,947 --> 0:3:16,827
Erm, they didn't give it to Jeff
but they didn't give it to you either.


46
0:3:16,827 --> 0:3:19,387
Is this...? Is this a funny joke?


47
0:3:19,387 --> 0:3:23,587
No. Mark, listen,
this is weird, really weird.


48
0:3:23,587 --> 0:3:28,147
But Barbara asked me to temporarily
take over the supervisor role.


49
0:3:28,147 --> 0:3:32,387
Well, good.
That's good. Great.


50
0:3:32,387 --> 0:3:35,547
- Well, I'll get on with these.
- Oh, let me...


51
0:3:35,547 --> 0:3:38,147
It doesn't matter! It doesn't matter.


52
0:3:38,147 --> 0:3:40,987
So what - congratulations -
what happened?


53
0:3:40,987 --> 0:3:44,867
Barbara thought no one
came up to the required standard


54
0:3:44,867 --> 0:3:50,267
- and decided as an interim...
- Sure, sure, but what's the real deal?


55
0:3:50,267 --> 0:3:53,987
- Does there need to be a...?
- No! I mean, you know how...


56
0:3:53,987 --> 0:3:59,27
how I think of you, but you've got to say
I'm the better loan manager, right?


57
0:3:59,27 --> 0:4:1,387
- Well...
- You've got to say that.


58
0:4:1,387 --> 0:4:3,947
You're very good at your job, Mark.


59
0:4:3,947 --> 0:4:6,667
- Thanks, boss.
- That's all right.


60
0:4:6,667 --> 0:4:9,667
- Can you finish the Hertfordshire file?
- Yeah.


61
0:4:9,667 --> 0:4:12,387
- By tonight?
- You're serious?


62
0:4:12,387 --> 0:4:15,867
- It's not a big...
- No, totally, that's fine, fine.


63
0:4:15,867 --> 0:4:18,307
Yeah, I'll do that. Fine.


64
0:4:18,307 --> 0:4:22,27
'Just dance a death clog dance
over my hopes and dreams


65
0:4:22,27 --> 0:4:24,707
'and leave a girl turd in my happy place.


66
0:4:24,707 --> 0:4:27,867
'Shit, I should have
milked those blindies dry! '


67
0:4:27,867 --> 0:4:32,627
Yeah, so this is really very similar to
a much larger version


68
0:4:32,627 --> 0:4:36,347
of the old graphics equaliser
that you have on your hi-fi


69
0:4:36,347 --> 0:4:40,627
in that it takes the graphics,
which is another word for music


70
0:4:40,627 --> 0:4:42,627
and equalises them...


71
0:4:42,627 --> 0:4:48,107
'I've lost her. She's gone. I'm actually
quite boring when I put my mind to it. '


72
0:4:48,107 --> 0:4:52,347
- And the Chemical Brothers are in?
- Yeah, yeah. They're great.


73
0:4:52,347 --> 0:4:54,507
Really great group. Lovely guys.


74
0:4:54,507 --> 0:4:56,747
'Come on, this is it. '


75
0:4:56,747 --> 0:5:1,307
So, just sitting here you can almost
feel your mojo expanding.


76
0:5:1,307 --> 0:5:5,627
- Have you seen my book?
- No, I...


77
0:5:5,627 --> 0:5:8,507
- Oh, hi.
- Hi.


78
0:5:8,507 --> 0:5:12,387
Is that Burroughs And The Drug Culture?
I love that book.


79
0:5:12,387 --> 0:5:15,107
Me too. I've been reading it for a year.


80
0:5:15,107 --> 0:5:18,987
I'm on the bit where Kerouac
finishes his Benzedrine high


81
0:5:18,987 --> 0:5:22,627
looks at his novel
and realises he wasn't holding a pen.


82
0:5:22,627 --> 0:5:26,227
Course, Ginsberg's in the corner,
ain't he, laughing.


83
0:5:26,227 --> 0:5:28,627
- But crying at the same time.
- Yeah.


84
0:5:28,627 --> 0:5:32,747
'Oh, great, they've clicked.
Brilliant, I hear clicking. '


85
0:5:32,747 --> 0:5:35,227
...it shits on Birdsong.
- So, Jez,


86
0:5:35,227 --> 0:5:38,947
could you have a look
at that thing for me on reception?


87
0:5:38,947 --> 0:5:42,707
The thing? Oh, that. I fixed that.


88
0:5:42,707 --> 0:5:45,947
Did you? Well, it's, er, gone again.


89
0:5:45,947 --> 0:5:48,547
No, I fixed it. Twice.


90
0:5:48,547 --> 0:5:52,107
I was just down there.
It's definitely not working.


91
0:5:52,107 --> 0:5:53,827
'Fuck off. '


92
0:5:53,827 --> 0:5:56,707
- What isn't?
- The thing you fixed.


93
0:5:56,707 --> 0:5:58,827
I'm just showing Toni around...


94
0:5:58,827 --> 0:6:2,987
Jeremy, I'm fine.
Your thing sounds... important.


95
0:6:2,987 --> 0:6:5,147
- Maybe...
- Hans.


96
0:6:5,147 --> 0:6:7,587
Super Hans.


97
0:6:7,587 --> 0:6:10,667
Super Hans could show me
the other equipment?


98
0:6:10,667 --> 0:6:13,867
'It's cool, there's a bond of trust.


99
0:6:13,867 --> 0:6:23,27
'He won't break the bond of trust. '


100
0:6:23,27 --> 0:6:25,427
- Ow!
- Sorry.


101
0:6:25,427 --> 0:6:28,187
'Yeah, sorry. You'll be sorry, bitch!


102
0:6:28,187 --> 0:6:31,27
'What a horrible... I couldn't hate her.


103
0:6:31,27 --> 0:6:37,67
'Why didn't I tell them the phones thing?
The phones thing rocks!


104
0:6:37,67 --> 0:6:39,987
'Sophie, climbing over
my dead body to...


105
0:6:39,987 --> 0:6:44,587
'It's not her fault. She doesn't
even realise, she's just a stooge.


106
0:6:44,587 --> 0:6:49,187
'A beautiful, stupid, ugly, shitting,
filthy, grasping stooge! '


107
0:6:49,187 --> 0:6:51,627
- Whoops!
- Ha.


108
0:6:51,627 --> 0:6:54,547
'Come on, Mark, don't let this ruin things.


109
0:6:54,547 --> 0:6:56,867
'Besides, once you're going steady


110
0:6:56,867 --> 0:7:1,227
'you can put her handbag in the fridge
and tell her she's going mad. '


111
0:7:1,227 --> 0:7:3,627
What's funny?


112
0:7:3,627 --> 0:7:6,267
Nothing, sorry. Good shot.


113
0:7:6,267 --> 0:7:10,507
'It's just a game. A grown-up game.
Mousetrap. Downfall.


114
0:7:10,507 --> 0:7:16,987
'Hunt The Yorkshire Ripper. It's not
her fault. Didn't mention the phones! '


115
0:7:16,987 --> 0:7:21,307
Phew! 15-9. Well played.
Shall we call it a day?


116
0:7:21,307 --> 0:7:24,987
- What?
- Sorry, I've been invited to dinner.


117
0:7:24,987 --> 0:7:28,307
- Aren't we going for dinner?
- You never said.


118
0:7:28,307 --> 0:7:31,347
- I thought we said.
- I don't think we said.


119
0:7:31,347 --> 0:7:35,227
- The whole team's going and...
- The whole team. The team.


120
0:7:35,227 --> 0:7:38,547
- Sorry, it's really rude, but I thought...
- Fine.


121
0:7:38,547 --> 0:7:41,707
'It's all fine. Everything is clear.


122
0:7:41,707 --> 0:7:44,267
'I love her. She is going to kill me. '


123
0:7:44,267 --> 0:7:48,107
It's all totally fine.


124
0:7:48,107 --> 0:7:54,267
'She's my guest, I invited her.
Why am I making Ron lattes all day? '


125
0:7:54,267 --> 0:7:58,667
Jez! Just, er, showing Toni
the drum loop from Bomb Dog.


126
0:7:58,667 --> 0:8:3,227
'She'll get bored of him,
just like she got bored of me. '


127
0:8:3,227 --> 0:8:6,707
OK, see you.
You sure you can get home from here?


128
0:8:6,707 --> 0:8:8,147
Uh-huh.


129
0:8:8,147 --> 0:8:11,387
'You can never go home again.
Winter's coming.


130
0:8:11,387 --> 0:8:15,107
'Is this Stalingrad?
Is this where it all ends?


131
0:8:15,107 --> 0:8:18,947
'Or is this... where it all starts?!


132
0:8:18,947 --> 0:8:22,427
'This is a good idea. This is a great idea!


133
0:8:22,427 --> 0:8:27,467
'It's exactly what they're looking for
and not expecting! Just do it! '


134
0:8:27,467 --> 0:8:31,147
- Alan, Mike, Barbara, mind if I butt in?
- Mark.


135
0:8:31,147 --> 0:8:35,27
I'm not going to tuck in,
courtesy of the expense account,


136
0:8:35,27 --> 0:8:38,227
I just wanted to share with you
my vision...


137
0:8:38,227 --> 0:8:40,467
- Mark!
- Can this wait?


138
0:8:40,467 --> 0:8:44,427
Can JLB's future wait till tomorrow?
I don't think so.


139
0:8:44,427 --> 0:8:46,947
And you'll agree when you hear the idea


140
0:8:46,947 --> 0:8:50,187
I was just too darn scared
to spill at interview.


141
0:8:50,187 --> 0:8:54,107
- I know you wanted...
- Reroute the phones.


142
0:8:54,107 --> 0:8:56,627
'This was definitely a good idea. '


143
0:8:56,627 --> 0:9:0,467
Simple as that, reroute the phones
to everyone's mobiles.


144
0:9:0,467 --> 0:9:5,267
24-hour, face-to-face, round-the-clock
customer-freaking-service.


145
0:9:5,267 --> 0:9:9,867
It's like, hey, I'm clocking off,
finger to the customer! Not any more!


146
0:9:9,867 --> 0:9:12,907
Probably best
if you go home now, old son.


147
0:9:12,907 --> 0:9:16,387
I've worked with blind kids!
I'm the full package!


148
0:9:16,387 --> 0:9:20,667
I'll have my action plan on your desk
first thing in the morning.


149
0:9:20,667 --> 0:9:23,187
'This was definitely a good idea.


150
0:9:23,187 --> 0:9:29,387
'There's no chance
this wasn't a good idea. '


151
0:9:29,387 --> 0:9:31,427
Call yourself a mate, mate?


152
0:9:31,427 --> 0:9:34,227
- What?
- Oh, yeah, right, "What?"


153
0:9:34,227 --> 0:9:35,987
I saw you leave her flat today.


154
0:9:35,987 --> 0:9:39,587
She wanted bongo lessons,
she has a passion for percussion.


155
0:9:39,587 --> 0:9:44,267
She hasn't got a bongo. You weren't
carrying a... There was no bongo.


156
0:9:44,267 --> 0:9:47,747
- You don't need a drum to...
- Look, I'm next door,


157
0:9:47,747 --> 0:9:50,387
I heard your... noise, last night.


158
0:9:50,387 --> 0:9:53,227
Oh, that. That was press-ups.


159
0:9:53,227 --> 0:9:56,947
Well, you certainly seemed
to enjoy the last few a lot.


160
0:9:56,947 --> 0:10:0,467
Mate, sometimes you've got
to push for the burn.


161
0:10:0,467 --> 0:10:3,187
'Uh-oh, it's the human time bomb. '


162
0:10:3,187 --> 0:10:7,467
- Hey, Jeremy.
- Hey, man. Good to see you.


163
0:10:7,467 --> 0:10:11,907
We're just hangin' out with the band.
Long day at the studio.


164
0:10:11,907 --> 0:10:13,947
So, how are you doing?


165
0:10:13,947 --> 0:10:17,27
- Good. I'm feeling pretty good.
- Great.


166
0:10:17,27 --> 0:10:22,547
The way I see it now, if Barbara thinks
Sophie's right for the job


167
0:10:22,547 --> 0:10:26,907
then Sophie's right for the job.


168
0:10:26,907 --> 0:10:31,27
'Barbara, thought we should
follow-up re: The phones thing.


169
0:10:31,27 --> 0:10:34,907
'Oh, you're not here.
Well, I'll leave my idea in your desk,


170
0:10:34,907 --> 0:10:39,867
'give you time to think about it.
My new idea is urine. Loads of urine.


171
0:10:39,867 --> 0:10:45,347
'What do you think about that? Don't you
think that will be just the ticket?


172
0:10:45,347 --> 0:10:48,507
'You're getting some too. '


173
0:10:48,507 --> 0:10:51,827
JLB Credit, fuck off, please.


174
0:10:51,827 --> 0:10:54,67
'What? From Sophie?


175
0:10:54,67 --> 0:10:58,987
'Application letter to...?
She did it. She stiffed me.


176
0:10:58,987 --> 0:11:2,387
'Well, Sophie's drawer's
getting a dousing too.


177
0:11:2,387 --> 0:11:4,707
'Or I could park a turd on her desk.


178
0:11:4,707 --> 0:11:8,387
'Bit freaky. Pissing's OK.
Pissing's just horseplay.


179
0:11:8,387 --> 0:11:13,827
'Oh, my God! Oh, no! I didn't do it!
It was a joke - she did it to me last week.


180
0:11:13,827 --> 0:11:15,267
'Shit! '


181
0:11:15,267 --> 0:11:18,587
- Mark?
- Sophie, I didn't realise you were here.


182
0:11:18,587 --> 0:11:21,347
Yeah, working late. What are you doing?


183
0:11:21,347 --> 0:11:24,227
Oh, just likewise. Er, working late.


184
0:11:24,227 --> 0:11:27,867
- Left a file here somewhere.
- Right.


185
0:11:27,867 --> 0:11:30,787
Mark, I'm glad
I bumped into you actually.


186
0:11:30,787 --> 0:11:35,347
About the other night at the restaurant,
I just wanted you to know...


187
0:11:35,347 --> 0:11:38,467
- 'Don't notice the piss. '
- Yeah, Mark?


188
0:11:38,467 --> 0:11:41,467
Yeah, totally.


189
0:11:41,467 --> 0:11:43,987
Oh, I knew she had these somewhere.


190
0:11:43,987 --> 0:11:47,747
- Let me get those for you.
- Oh. Thanks, Mark.


191
0:11:47,747 --> 0:11:50,67
Erm, listen, do you want to...?


192
0:11:50,67 --> 0:11:55,667
Better not, thanks.
Got a lot to do. Thanks.


193
0:11:55,667 --> 0:12:6,107
'Yeah, I've got to take the letter-shaped
knife out of my back. Judas!


194
0:12:6,107 --> 0:12:9,27
'OK, they're a bit crinkled. So what?


195
0:12:9,27 --> 0:12:12,267
"'Hello, police,
someone broke into my office


196
0:12:12,267 --> 0:12:17,427
"'and crinkled my papers. " I think not. '


197
0:12:17,427 --> 0:12:19,427
- Hello, Mark?
- Sophie?


198
0:12:19,427 --> 0:12:24,667
I'm coming in if you're decent.
I'm going for a coffee.


199
0:12:24,667 --> 0:12:29,667
- What happened?
- It's not piss.


200
0:12:29,667 --> 0:12:34,627
So, I offer a mixture of therapy with other
disciplines such as careers guidance.


201
0:12:34,627 --> 0:12:39,227
But mainly you're
a careers guidance counsellor?


202
0:12:39,227 --> 0:12:43,747
I want to make it clear, I'm here
for careers guidance, not therapy.


203
0:12:43,747 --> 0:12:46,387
Not therapy. OK.


204
0:12:46,387 --> 0:12:49,867
- What are you saying?
- I'm just interested in why...


205
0:12:49,867 --> 0:12:55,107
I don't want to talk about any difficult
feelings I may be experiencing,


206
0:12:55,107 --> 0:12:58,587
my mother, my father
or my so-called childhood.


207
0:12:58,587 --> 0:13:1,147
Fine, fine.


208
0:13:1,147 --> 0:13:5,987
Well, I like to kick things off
with a bit of word association. It's...


209
0:13:5,987 --> 0:13:8,547
- Therapy?
- Not really, no.


210
0:13:8,547 --> 0:13:13,667
I'll say a word and you tell me the very
first thing that pops into your mind.


211
0:13:13,667 --> 0:13:15,667
'He's trying to therapise me. '


212
0:13:15,667 --> 0:13:19,947
- Let's start with an obvious one - work.
- 'Snake pit. '


213
0:13:19,947 --> 0:13:22,27
Snake charmer.


214
0:13:22,27 --> 0:13:25,667
Just say the first thing
that comes to mind. Money.


215
0:13:25,667 --> 0:13:28,347
- 'Everything. '
- Not everything.


216
0:13:28,347 --> 0:13:30,27
- Children.
- 'Blind. '


217
0:13:30,27 --> 0:13:32,27
- Er, short.
- Father.


218
0:13:32,27 --> 0:13:33,867
- 'Fuehrer. '
- Football.


219
0:13:33,867 --> 0:13:35,907
- Mother.
- 'Sophie. '


220
0:13:35,907 --> 0:13:38,67
Fuck! No, not fuck.


221
0:13:38,67 --> 0:13:42,187
Mark, I really get the feeling
you're resisting something.


222
0:13:42,187 --> 0:13:46,467
Can I change those? What score
did I get? It wasn't good, was it?


223
0:13:46,467 --> 0:13:50,307
- You don't get a score.
- Right, sure you don't.


224
0:13:50,307 --> 0:13:52,747
Maybe we should try something else.


225
0:13:52,747 --> 0:13:58,267
Have you done a Rorschach test?


226
0:13:58,267 --> 0:14:0,107
What do you see?


227
0:14:0,107 --> 0:14:3,787
'A hairy twat. A hungry, devouring twat. '


228
0:14:3,787 --> 0:14:6,507
A kitten?


229
0:14:6,507 --> 0:14:10,107
After that hook
we need to hit something, yeah?


230
0:14:10,107 --> 0:14:13,507
'They don't know about
my massive musical brain.


231
0:14:13,507 --> 0:14:16,507
'To them, I'm just
a mild-mannered janitor. '


232
0:14:16,507 --> 0:14:20,627
- The chorus is working.
- 'The chorus is like the Frog Chorus!


233
0:14:20,627 --> 0:14:23,267
' Someone needs to tell them.


234
0:14:23,267 --> 0:14:26,587
'I'm an outsider but I'm on the inside.


235
0:14:26,587 --> 0:14:30,627
'This is my moment.
Go on, do it, cross the drawbridge.


236
0:14:30,627 --> 0:14:32,667
'Make the splash. '


237
0:14:32,667 --> 0:14:37,67
Maybe you should just
mess things up a bit.


238
0:14:37,67 --> 0:14:38,507
Sorry?


239
0:14:38,507 --> 0:14:44,467
I mean, don't you think it'd be better
if the sound was more kaz-zow?!


240
0:14:44,467 --> 0:14:46,507
Yeah. OK.


241
0:14:46,507 --> 0:14:49,67
Not so much A to B to C,


242
0:14:49,67 --> 0:14:52,227
but more sort of A to D


243
0:14:52,227 --> 0:14:55,867
and then back to A and then to X!


244
0:14:55,867 --> 0:14:58,947
You know, just better. Like your first CD.


245
0:14:58,947 --> 0:15:7,27
I mean, obviously I don't want to butt in.
I mean... It's your song.


246
0:15:7,27 --> 0:15:12,747
Cos like I say, at the moment
it is very duh-duh-duh-duh.


247
0:15:12,747 --> 0:15:16,907
Oh, God, we're doing the fucking song.


248
0:15:16,907 --> 0:15:19,27
When's it gonna finish?


249
0:15:19,27 --> 0:15:22,227
Fuckin' hell.


250
0:15:22,227 --> 0:15:27,67
Where as I'm thinkin' it should be more...


251
0:15:27,67 --> 0:15:33,427
Whereas, like I say,
at the moment it is more kind of...


252
0:15:33,427 --> 0:15:36,547
Which it doesn't have to be.


253
0:15:36,547 --> 0:15:40,147
Yeah. No.


254
0:15:40,147 --> 0:15:43,907
Yeah, that's great. Thanks, mate.


255
0:15:43,907 --> 0:15:45,987
No problem, mate.


256
0:15:45,987 --> 0:15:50,947
'This was definitely a good idea. There's
no chance this wasn't a good idea. '


257
0:15:50,947 --> 0:15:54,227
Yeah, anyone could see that.
No, I'll tell him.


258
0:15:54,227 --> 0:15:58,147
All right, Mr T. Cheers then.


259
0:15:58,147 --> 0:16:0,427
Sorry, mate, you're out.


260
0:16:0,427 --> 0:16:5,267
- Fired? But...
- Ron's tough. I did everything I could.


261
0:16:5,267 --> 0:16:8,227
- What? You didn't do shit.
- Earlier.


262
0:16:8,227 --> 0:16:12,667
Had it out with him earlier -
I threatened to walk, he wouldn't have it.


263
0:16:12,667 --> 0:16:14,747
So are you gonna walk now?


264
0:16:14,747 --> 0:16:17,387
Steady on, mate, I'm not Spartacus.


265
0:16:17,387 --> 0:16:22,907
That's pretty bloody obvious.
Well, I refuse.


266
0:16:22,907 --> 0:16:28,547
I'm not going.
So what are you gonna do about that?


267
0:16:28,547 --> 0:16:32,627
I'm still here, Super Hans.
Still standing here. You lose.


268
0:16:32,627 --> 0:16:35,507
- Ron? He won't go.
- I see through you.


269
0:16:35,507 --> 0:16:38,987
Trying to get me out
so you can muscle in on my woman.


270
0:16:38,987 --> 0:16:41,787
No, all right. OK. I'll put him on.


271
0:16:41,787 --> 0:16:45,267
...lay down and...


272
0:16:45,267 --> 0:16:52,107
OK. No, that won't be necessary because
I'll be leaving the premises immediately.


273
0:16:52,107 --> 0:16:58,227
Thank you, Ron.


274
0:16:58,227 --> 0:17:0,387
'That's your entire life. '


275
0:17:0,387 --> 0:17:3,707
You see, he's not Lennon,
but she is Yoko.


276
0:17:3,707 --> 0:17:7,27
I'm Lennon
but Yoko has gone off with Paul.


277
0:17:7,27 --> 0:17:11,907
I mean, imagine that.
That's the scenario we're talking.


278
0:17:11,907 --> 0:17:16,427
- Don't they mind you not going in?
- They think I'm ill.


279
0:17:16,427 --> 0:17:22,267
I'm screwing the system
and there's not a thing they can do.


280
0:17:22,267 --> 0:17:25,107
Sophie's gonna pay. She'll pay all right.


281
0:17:25,107 --> 0:17:30,107
Yeah, I mean, what's wrong with revenge
and plagues and pestilence and all that?


282
0:17:30,107 --> 0:17:33,147
- Exactly!
- Suddenly you can't wreak revenge?


283
0:17:33,147 --> 0:17:38,187
It's political correctness gone mad.


284
0:17:38,187 --> 0:17:41,987
Jeremy, have you seen
Strangers On A Train?


285
0:17:41,987 --> 0:17:45,107
Yeah, sure. No one suspects the chef.


286
0:17:45,107 --> 0:17:49,467
It's about these two guys
who take care of each other's enemies.


287
0:17:49,467 --> 0:17:53,907
OK, right. And what happens in the end?


288
0:17:53,907 --> 0:17:55,827
I can't remember.


289
0:17:55,827 --> 0:17:58,987
But I'm pretty sure
it all turns out all right.


290
0:17:58,987 --> 0:18:5,387
'Happy painting, God bless. '


291
0:18:5,387 --> 0:18:8,547
- This is the ultimate.
- Yes, sirree.


292
0:18:8,547 --> 0:18:10,507
It's payback time.


293
0:18:10,507 --> 0:18:15,187
- And she's paying back in fear dollars.
- So what are you gonna say?


294
0:18:15,187 --> 0:18:18,107
I'm gonna cut her up
and leave her in buckets.


295
0:18:18,107 --> 0:18:22,307
No, you... Don't say that!
Jesus, that's horrible.


296
0:18:22,307 --> 0:18:26,107
Just say... something like...


297
0:18:26,107 --> 0:18:29,387
Ask is Mrs Hugh Jass there.


298
0:18:29,387 --> 0:18:34,227
No, no, she's got a thing about her bum.
How about Mike Hunt? No, no.


299
0:18:34,227 --> 0:18:36,507
What shall I say then? Oh, hello?


300
0:18:36,507 --> 0:18:41,867
Er, it's, erm...
I'm watching you.


301
0:18:41,867 --> 0:18:46,27
Not in a horrible way, just I can see you.


302
0:18:46,27 --> 0:18:49,587
Yes, I can. You're eating spaghetti.


303
0:18:49,587 --> 0:18:52,667
Linguine. Whatever.


304
0:18:52,667 --> 0:18:55,67
Well, I'm outside.


305
0:18:55,67 --> 0:18:58,27
I'm behind a bush.


306
0:18:58,27 --> 0:19:2,587
No, I'm not gonna tell you.
Look, I'm in charge here, I'm the one...


307
0:19:2,587 --> 0:19:6,947
There's no need to go over the top,
I'm just shitting you up a bit.


308
0:19:6,947 --> 0:19:10,107
- Jeremy, she's got an air gun!
- Sophie, I...!


309
0:19:10,107 --> 0:19:13,267
- She's going to...
- Oh, God! Jesus!


310
0:19:13,267 --> 0:19:17,507
- Bollocks, that kills!
- She's coming, we've got to...


311
0:19:17,507 --> 0:19:21,547
'Why not come clean?
You can say... You could say...


312
0:19:21,547 --> 0:19:25,427
'No, there is no possible way
of making this look...!


313
0:19:25,427 --> 0:19:33,27
'Oh, fuck! '


314
0:19:33,27 --> 0:19:35,227
Lucky you had those boots.


315
0:19:35,227 --> 0:19:38,67
Yeah, I suppose everything
turned out all right.


316
0:19:38,67 --> 0:19:40,107
Yeah, she got the message.


317
0:19:40,107 --> 0:19:43,107
'I've made a psycho call
to the woman I love,


318
0:19:43,107 --> 0:19:48,307
'I've kicked a dog to death, and now I'm
going to pepper-spray an acquaintance.


319
0:19:48,307 --> 0:19:50,507
'I mean, what's happened to me? '


320
0:19:50,507 --> 0:19:54,547
- You still up for this?
- Yeah, it's fine. I'm on it.


321
0:19:54,547 --> 0:19:58,187
- Great. The plan again?
- I give Super Hans the pizza,


322
0:19:58,187 --> 0:20:1,907
pepper-spray him,
kick him in the nuts and grab his wallet


323
0:20:1,907 --> 0:20:6,427
- so it looks like a robbery.
- That's the spirit.


324
0:20:6,427 --> 0:20:8,147
Go for it, buddy.


325
0:20:8,147 --> 0:20:11,627
'What am I doing? I can't do this!


326
0:20:11,627 --> 0:20:15,187
'There's no way I can do this! '


327
0:20:15,187 --> 0:20:18,747
Do I look like I eat pizza?


328
0:20:18,747 --> 0:20:22,67
There's no pizza.
It's me, Mark.


329
0:20:22,67 --> 0:20:27,507
I'm here to pepper-spray Super Hans
and kick him in the nuts but I can't.


330
0:20:27,507 --> 0:20:31,507
I can't, all right?
It's all gone over the edge of reason.


331
0:20:31,507 --> 0:20:35,627
- Mark?
- It would really help if you could scream.


332
0:20:35,627 --> 0:20:38,387
- Screaming?
- Yeah, and tell Jeremy...


333
0:20:38,387 --> 0:20:42,187
Why haven't you pepper-sprayed him?


334
0:20:42,187 --> 0:20:44,307
Jez? Is this for real?


335
0:20:44,307 --> 0:20:46,627
Er, I am not Jeremy, I am...


336
0:20:46,627 --> 0:20:51,707
Oh, lookee lookee at this!
What a very big surprise!


337
0:20:51,707 --> 0:20:54,107
Another late-night bongo lesson?


338
0:20:54,107 --> 0:20:57,747
Jeremy, we're two single people
having a great time.


339
0:20:57,747 --> 0:21:0,747
If you can't handle that,
go back to the '50s.


340
0:21:0,747 --> 0:21:4,267
Yeah. Yeah, maybe you should
make a move, mate.


341
0:21:4,267 --> 0:21:7,667
OK, mate, I'll make a move.
How about this for a move?


342
0:21:7,667 --> 0:21:10,747
Oh! Oh, fuck me!


343
0:21:10,747 --> 0:21:13,507
That's enough! Jez, there's no need to...


344
0:21:13,507 --> 0:21:18,107
Fuck! Oh, you sprayed me!
You fucking sprayed me!


345
0:21:18,107 --> 0:21:24,507
It's for your own good.


346
0:21:24,507 --> 0:21:28,147
OK, enough careers guidance...


347
0:21:28,147 --> 0:21:36,147
I need therapy.


348
0:21:36,147 --> 0:21:38,987
How could it have been
for my own good?


349
0:21:38,987 --> 0:21:41,507
I don't want to talk about it any more.


350
0:21:41,507 --> 0:21:44,947
You didn't kick him in the nuts -
that's something.


351
0:21:44,947 --> 0:21:47,667
You can build on that. The spray's gone.


352
0:21:47,667 --> 0:21:49,947
Where is it?


353
0:21:49,947 --> 0:21:51,987
Just tell me where it is.


354
0:21:51,987 --> 0:21:56,747
Look, Mr Klugman has a little mantra
that I'm finding very helpful.


355
0:21:56,747 --> 0:22:0,427
Heal and grow. Not to be patronising


356
0:22:0,427 --> 0:22:11,627
but perhaps you want to have
a good think about that.


357
0:22:11,627 --> 0:22:14,387
- Sophie?
- 'Heal and grow. Heal and grow. '


358
0:22:14,387 --> 0:22:17,347
Good to see you. Come in.


359
0:22:17,347 --> 0:22:22,627
- Mark, are you OK?
- I've been feeling a little low lately but...


360
0:22:22,627 --> 0:22:26,667
- What happened with...?
- Oh, that. That's nothing.


361
0:22:26,667 --> 0:22:29,427
Jeremy just hit me, with the ladle.


362
0:22:29,427 --> 0:22:33,987
Jesus, Jeremy!
You can't just hit people with ladles!


363
0:22:33,987 --> 0:22:36,467
He shouldn't have pepper-sprayed me.


364
0:22:36,467 --> 0:22:40,507
What? What's going on, Mark?
You've been away for...


365
0:22:40,507 --> 0:22:43,547
Sophie, Sophie, relax. I'm fine.


366
0:22:43,547 --> 0:22:45,387
Life is fine.


367
0:22:45,387 --> 0:22:48,67
'Cool, wet grass. Cool, wet grass. '


368
0:22:48,67 --> 0:22:51,547
I'm having therapy.
I'm going to the solarium.


369
0:22:51,547 --> 0:22:54,987
I have spoken with
the Citizens Advice Bureau.


370
0:22:54,987 --> 0:22:57,747
There's nothing inside killing me.


371
0:22:57,747 --> 0:23:0,107
Yeah? Good.


372
0:23:0,107 --> 0:23:3,907
Because I... I wanted
to apologise about the work thing.


373
0:23:3,907 --> 0:23:8,27
- I know how much you wanted it.
- 'Lying bitch! Not bitch. '


374
0:23:8,27 --> 0:23:10,587
It's fine, fine, fine.


375
0:23:10,587 --> 0:23:13,187
I've let go of all that stuff.


376
0:23:13,187 --> 0:23:15,27
- Yeah?
- Totally.


377
0:23:15,27 --> 0:23:17,67
Oh, that's great, really.


378
0:23:17,67 --> 0:23:20,67
And you're well out of it, it's all politics.


379
0:23:20,67 --> 0:23:22,707
The joke is, I don't really want the job


380
0:23:22,707 --> 0:23:26,387
but Barbara made me
write an application letter.


381
0:23:26,387 --> 0:23:28,747
Ahh. Right.


382
0:23:28,747 --> 0:23:33,947
'Jesus, so she didn't... I'm such
a cockmuncher. No, not cockmuncher. '


383
0:23:33,947 --> 0:23:37,147
So I just wanted to say
I enjoyed badminton


384
0:23:37,147 --> 0:23:41,467
and I hope when you're back on my team
we can get back to normal.


385
0:23:41,467 --> 0:23:44,307
- Your team.
- 'Heal and grow! Heal and grow! '


386
0:23:44,307 --> 0:23:48,307
Well, I guess it's very nice
for the big lady to come down here


387
0:23:48,307 --> 0:23:50,667
and talk to the little man.


388
0:23:50,667 --> 0:23:55,347
I'm just surprised you can see me
from up there in your ivory tower.


389
0:23:55,347 --> 0:23:57,947
If you're gonna be like that then fuck off.


390
0:23:57,947 --> 0:24:0,307
Sophie! Sophie, don't go!


391
0:24:0,307 --> 0:24:2,347
Sophie, I...


392
0:24:2,347 --> 0:24:7,747
Hey, Mark, I found it.


393
0:24:7,747 --> 0:26:7,747
It's for your own good.
