###105 MALE SPEAKER: Uh uh.
###106 MALE SPEAKER: Patrick, Patrick, flip of the day?
###107 P-STONE: Gees.

###111 That speaks for itself.
###114 ROBBIE RUSSO: Gnarly.
###115 
###122 MALE SPEAKER: How'd you get on Anti-Hero?
###124 ROBBIE RUSSO: I went to skate of the year when they won one.
###127 And then I talked to Darren, one of the guys, and Retta

###169 hit up earlier.
###169 MALE SPEAKER: Are you bummed you didn't do the--
###172 ROBBIE RUSSO: Yeah.
###174 I wanted to do it but the cops came.

###180 MALE SPEAKER: Fucking Robbie.
###183 MALE SPEAKER: How much money is on the line?
###185 MALE SPEAKER: Robbie's got hot hands.
###186 Two bucks.
###187 MALE SPEAKER: So tell me, do you have
###188 homework on this trip?
###188 ROBBIE RUSSO: Yeah, journal.

###201 PATRICK O'DELL: We just got done at the park.
###203 It's the end of the second day.
###205 We're going to pick up Spike Jonze.
###208 I think that's kind of cool because its been real
###209 Anti-Hero heavy so far with the tents
###211 and Anti-Hero lifestyle.
###213 Adding Spike Jonze into the mix might make it a little
###216 more Girl skateboards.
###218 He's probably got the gnarliest tent ever.
###220 
###231 SPIKE JONZE: How's it going?
###233 MALE SPEAKER: How are you?
###234 SPIKE JONZE: I totally spaced out.
###237 MALE SPEAKER: So you don't know who we are?
###239 SPIKE JONZE: [LAUGHTER]
###240 MALE SPEAKER: We came for you.
###241 SPIKE JONZE: How pretty is this place?
###243 MALE SPEAKER: It's nice.
###244 SPIKE JONZE: It's insane.
###245 MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, you got your tent?
###248 SPIKE JONZE: I think Brink might have me hooked up, but I
###251 think Eric's not coming in until Monday, so
###253 I can use his stuff.
###254 MALE SPEAKER: So what made you decide to come on the trip?
###257 SPIKE JONZE: Just to get out of town.
###260 Works been stressful.
###261 And just get out on the road with the guys.
###265 And plus, I haven't been on a trip with
###269 those guys in a while.
###270 In plus, if they're going out with the Anti-Hero guys, which
###274 sounds like a one time thing.
###276 How often is that going to happen?
###277 I think the last time I went camping was for a Girl camping
###282 trip, and it was messy.
###282 MALE SPEAKER: What do you mean messy?
###285 SPIKE JONZE: Just drunken beyond drunken.
###290 MALE SPEAKER: Cover your eyes.
