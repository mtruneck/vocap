###1 MORNING. LAST TIME WHEN WE ENDED THE LECTURE WE
###4 WERE TALKING ABOUT THE TWO MOST RECENT DISCOVERED
###7 PLANT GROWTH REGULATORS AND WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE
###10 AUXINS AND THE GIBBERELLINS. AND WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO
###19 DO TODAY IS TO CONTINUE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT SOME OF
###22 THE GROWTH REGULATORS AND TO SHOW YOU HOW MANY OF
###25 THESE GROWTH REGULATORS, IN FACT, ALL OF THEM IN ONE
###28 WAY OR ANOTHER IMPACT ON MANY OF THE ACTIVITIES OF
###31 YOUR LIFE HAVE A LOT TO DO WITH THE FOODS THAT YOU
###34 EAT. AFTER THE DISCOVERY OF THE AUXINS AND
###37 GIBBERELLINS IN THE EARLY 1950'S AND A LITTLE BIT
###42 EARLIER, PEOPLE BELIEVED THAT THERE MUST BE OTHER
###44 PLANT GROWTH REGULATORS THAT WERE OUT THERE. AND SO
###47 THERE WAS A LARGE AMOUNT OF RESEARCH THAT WAS PUT
###51 FORWARD INTO TRYING TO FIND OTHER GROWTH REGULATORS.
###53 OTHER COMPOUNDS WHICH IN VERY LOW CONCENTRATIONS WOULD
###57 EFFECT PROFOUNDLY GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT IN PLANTS.
###60 THE QUESTION WAS, HOW WOULD YOU FIND THESE. DON'T
###63 
###65 IN THE 1950'S, WE DIDN'T HAVE THE SENSE THAT CHEMICAL
###69 ANALYSIS THAT WE HAVE TODAY. SO, PEOPLE HAD TO RESORT
###72 TO OTHER SYSTEMS IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO FIND OR TO BE
###76 ABLE TO DETECT THESE OTHER COMPOUNDS THAT WERE
###78 PROBABLY PRESENT IN VERY, VERY LOW AMOUNTS. AND, ONE
###82 OF THE WAYS THEY DID IT, WILL BE ILLUSTRATED IN THIS
###84 FIRST SORT OF PORTION OF THE LECTURE. I WANT TO TALK
###88 TO YOU ABOUT THE SYSTEM THAT WAS DEVELOPED TO HELP
###90 PEOPLE DETECTOR TO FIND NEW GROWTH REGULATORS. AND
###93 THIS SYSTEM DEPENDS UPON THE FACT THAT IF WE MAKE A
###97 CROSS SECTION OF THE STEM, IN THE CENTER OF THE STEM
###104 IS THE PITH. THESE PITH ARE UNDIFFERENTIATED
###109 PARENCHYMA CELLS WHICH YOU HAVE ALREADY SEEN BEFORE
###117 WHEN WE TALKED THE STEM. NOT ONLY ARE THESE CELLS
###121 UNDIFFERENTIATED PARENCHYMA CELLS, BUT BECAUSE THEY
###124 ARE LOCATED IN THE CENTER, THEY ARE ESSENTIALLY FREE
###128 OF ANY MICROBIAL CONTAMINATION AND THEY ARE SAID TO BE
###131 
###136 CONTAMINATION. AND SO WHAT WAS DONE WAS TO USE THESE
###141 CELLS IN A TECHNIQUE WHICH WAS KNOWN AS TISSUE
###144 CULTURE. SOME OF YOU HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE OR HAVE
###148 READ SOMETHING ABOUT THIS. LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW THEY
###152 DID THIS. WE HAD AN ERLENMEYER FLASK, ERLENMEYER
###157 FLASK. SO HERE WE HAVE A FLASK. AND WE HAVE A MEDIUM
###164 HERE WHATEVER IT COULD BE, SOME KIND OF CULTURE
###167 MEDIUM. AND, INTO THIS ERLENMEYER FLASK WE PUT THE
###172 PITH. THE PITH TISSUE. AND THEN WHAT THESE WORKERS
###179 DID WAS THEY BEGAN TO TAKE PLANTS AND TO EXTRACT THEM,
###185 TO FRACTIONATE THEM, TO BREAK THEM DOWN IN TO SMALLER
###187 AND SMALLER FRACTIONS. AND THEN TO INCLUDE THE
###194 FRACTIONS INTO THE CULTURE MEDIUM. AND THEN TO SEE
###202 WHAT HAPPENED. WHAT WAS THE RESULT. WHAT KIND OF
###205 PHENOMENOLOGY DID THE PARENCHYMA CELLS, THE PITH CELLS
###210 BEGIN TO SHOW. AND COMING FROM THIS WORK WAS THE
###213 DISCOVERY OF THE THIRD GROUP OF PLANT GROWTH
###223 A GROUP OF
###223 GROWTH REGULATORS WHICH IN VERY LOW CONCENTRATIONS
###226 STIMULATED CELL DIVISION. SO, IF YOU LOOKED INSIDE OF
###231 THIS FLASK, WHICH ORIGINALLY HAD THE PARENCHYMA CELLS
###234 IN IT, WE NOW HAD A LARGE UNDIFFERENTIATED MASS OF
###246 CELLS. AND, BIOLOGISTS HAD TO GIVE A NAME TO THIS
###253 LARGE UNDIFFERENTIATED MASS OF CELLS, SO THEY CALL IT
###255 A CALLUS, CALLUS. YOU WILL SEE IT REFERRED TO THIS
###261 WAY IN YOUR TEXT BOOK. A LARGE UNDIFFERENTIATED MASS
###263 OF CELLS. WHEN THEY THEN LOOKED TO SEE WHAT WAS IN
###267 THIS FRACTION THAT WAS CAUSING THESE CELLS TO DIVIDE
###271 VERY RAPIDLY, THEY DISCOVERED A GROUP OF COMPOUNDS
###276 WHICH WE COLLECTIVELY CALL TODAY, CYTOKININS. THAT
###282 IS, THEY STIMULATE CELL DIVISION, CYTOKINESES WHICH IS
###286 WHERE THE TERM CYTOKININS COMES FROM. CYTOKINESES.
###289 THEY STIMULATE CELL DIVISION. CYTOKININS ARE PROBABLY
###296 OF THE GROWTH REGULATORS WE ARE GOING TO TALK ABOUT,
###298 THE ONES WHICH WE DON'T HAVE MUCH EVIDENCE FOR THEIR
###302 
###306 VERY PROFOUND EFFECTS ON GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT. SO,
###308 LET'S LIST SOME OF THE GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE
###315 CYTOKININS. THE FIRST CHARACTERISTIC WAS THE BASIS OF
###323 THEIR DISCOVERY. THEY STIMULATE CELL DIVISION. THE
###330 SECOND CHARACTERISTIC IS A VERY INTERESTING ONE, THEY
###333 DELAY SENESCENCE.
###342 SENESCENCE OR DEATH. AND THIS IS
###346 AN INTERESTING TOPIC, ONE WHICH HAS NOT BEEN STUDIED
###349 TOO MUCH, BUT IS OBVIOUSLY ONE WHICH MIGHT HAVE A LOT
###353 OF PRACTICAL VALUE. A THIRD SORT OF THING THAT
###359 CYTOKININS DO IS IN, LET'S SAY, IN COMBINATION WITH
###371 OTHER GROWTH REGULATORS, THEY CAN AFFECT PLANT
###379 DEVELOPMENT.
###394 AND LET'S TALK ABOUT HOW THEY DO THIS
###399 AND I WANT TO FOCUS ON ONE OF THE GROWTH REGULATORS
###401 THAT THEY WORK IN COMBINATION WITH. ONE THAT YOU HAVE
###405 SEEN BEFORE, ALTHOUGH, THIS IS NOT THE ONLY ONE IN
###407 WHICH THEY HAVE EFFECTS. AND THIS COMBINATION HAS TO
###411 DO WITH AUXIN AND CYTOKININS. IF IN THIS TISSUE
###423 IF IN THIS
###423 TISSUE CULTURE FLASK THAT WE DREW BEFORE, WE INCLUDE
###426 BOTH AUXINS AND CYTOKININS. IN THE MEDIUM WE CAN
###434 PROFOUNDLY EFFECT THE CALLUS TISSUE AND IN ORDER TO
###439 SUMMARIZE A LARGE NUMBER OF EXPERIMENTS I AM GOING TO
###442 MAKE THIS GRAPH FOR YOU OVER HERE. ON THIS GRAPH WE
###446 ARE GOING TO HAVE AUXIN ON THE Y AXIS AND THIS WOULD
###452 BE INCREASING CONCENTRATIONS OF AUXIN WITH ZERO DOWN
###457 AT THE BOTTOM. EVERYBODY CLEAR ABOUT THAT? AND ON
###460 THE X AXIS WE ARE GOING TO PUT CYTOKININ WITH
###465 INCREASING CONCENTRATIONS IN THIS DIRECTION. SO, IF
###473 THE FLASK CONTAINED NO AUXIN OR NO CYTOKININ IT WOULD
###476 BE ZERO. AND IF IT HAD A LOT OF AUXIN BUT A LOW LEVEL
###480 OF CYTOKININ IT WOULD HAVE A HIGH RATIO OF AUXIN TO
###484 CYTOKININ OR IF IT HAD A LOT OF CYTOKININ BUT LOW
###488 LEVELS OF AUXIN, IT WOULD HAVE A HIGH RATIO OF
###490 CYTOKININ TO AUXIN. THE FIRST THING THAT WAS FOUND IS
###493 IF YOU INCLUDED IN THIS MEDIUM, AUXIN AND CYTOKININ IN
###498 
###501 ABOUT THE SAME RATIO 1 TO 1. WHAT YOU FOUND IS THAT
###504 THE CALLUS REMAINED UNDIFFERENTIATED.
###507 UNDIFFERENTIATED CALLUS. ON THE OTHER HAND, IF THE
###516 RATIO OF THE AUXIN AND THE CYTOKININ IN THE FLASK, I
###520 WILL SHOW YOU SOME PICTURES OF THESE IN A MOMENT, WAS
###523 FAVORING AUXIN SO THAT IS, YOU HAD A HIGH AMOUNT OF
###527 AUXIN RELATIVE TO A LOW AMOUNT OF CYTOKININ, THE
###531 CALLUS FORMED ROOTS. CALLUS FORMED ROOTS. AND, IF
###539 YOU HAD A HIGH LEVEL OF CYTOKININ, THAT IS SOME PLACE
###543 OVER HERE AND A LOW LEVEL OF AUXIN AND YOU PUT THAT IN
###548 TO THE CULTURE MEDIUM THE CALLUS FORMED SHOOTS. SO
###558 SIMPLY BY VARYING THE RATIO ON THE AMOUNTS AS WELL,
###561 ONE COULD EFFECT IN A VERY PROFOUND WAY THE
###564 DEVELOPMENT OF THESE CALLUS CELLS SETTING THEM OFF ON
###568 A COURSE OF DEVELOPMENT WHICH WAS VERY DIFFERENT,
###570 EITHER SHOOTS OR ROOTS OR REMAINING THE SAME. WE
###574 DON'T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THIS PROCESS. IT IS A VERY
###576 
###580 REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THIS RATIO IS EFFECTING
###583 THE DIFFERENTIATION. FOURTH EFFECT OF CYTOKININS IS
###590 THAT THEY OVERCOME APICAL DOMINANCE.
###599 WHICH AS WE SAID
###600 WAS DUE TO AUXIN. SO, LET'S LOOK AT THAT STATEMENT
###607 OVER HERE. IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE, WE HAVE A SHOOT
###613 WITH STRONG APICAL DOMINANCE.
###622 THAT MEANS THAT, WE
###624 WILL JUST MAKE ONE HERE, THAT THE AXILLARY BUDS DON'T
###627 GROW OUT.
###639 IF ON THE OTHER HAND, YOU NOW ADD CYTOKININ
###649 AND USUALLY YOU CAN TAKE A DROP OF LIQUID AND JUST PUT
###652 A DROP OF LIQUID ON TOP OF THAT AXILLARY BUD, IF YOU
###655 ADD CYTOKININ TO THIS AND YOU WAIT FOR SOME TIME, WHAT
###661 YOU FIND, HERE ARE THE LEAVES, IS THAT THE AXILLARY
###664 BUD GROWS OUT.
###674 GROWS OUT. WE DON'T KNOW HOW THIS
###677 HAPPENS, BUT WE KNOW THAT THE CYTOKININ IS ABLE TO
###681 OVERCOME THAT STRONG REPRESSION OF AXILLARY BUD OUT
###684 GROWTH BY SOME METHOD THAT WE HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT.
###688 HOWEVER, THIS IS INSTRUCTIVE BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME
###692 
###695 WITH. KNOWN AS WITCH'S BROOM, IN WHICH, IF YOU LOOK
###702 AT THE DISEASE THE PLANT HAS ON THE BRANCH, ALL OF THE
###706 AXILLARY BUDS ARE RELEASED. ALL THE AXILLARY BUDS
###709 GROW OUT.
###717 AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE BROOM OF A WITCH.
###719 SO THIS IS WHY IT IS CALLED WITCH'S BROOM. NOW, HOW
###722 DOES THIS DISEASE CAUSE THESE AXILLARY BUDS TO GROW
###726 OUT? ESSENTIALLY THIS DISEASE, WHICH IS CAUSED BY
###731 A BACTERIUM, EITHER THE BACTERIUM PRODUCES CYTOKININ
###743 OR CAUSES THE PLANT TO PRODUCE MORE CYTOKININ.
###756 THE NET EFFECT IS THAT THERE IS A LARGE AMOUNT
###760 OF CYTOKININ WHERE THE BACTERIUM HAS INFECTED THE
###762 PLANT AND THIS RESULTS IN A CHANGE IN THE RATIO OF
###766 CYTOKININ TO AUXIN AND THE BUDS ALL GROW OUT MAKING
###769 THIS STRUCTURE. AND MANY OF YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THIS
###772 BEFORE AND NOT REALIZED THAT IT IS CAUSED BY
###774 A DISEASE. NOW, WE SAID THAT CYTOKININS ALSO
###777 STIMULATE CELL DIVISION AND THIS WAS TAKEN UP BY THE
###781 
###783 YOU CAN ALSO BACTERIAL DISEASES WHICH INFECT PLANTS.
###787 CYTOKININS AGAIN ARE EITHER PRODUCED BY THE BACTERIUM
###790 OR THE PLANT MAKES MORE BACTERIUM, AND THIS RESULTS IN
###793 THE PRODUCTION OF TUMORS. TUMORS. AND THESE TUMORS
###798 MIMIC WHAT ONE MIGHT FIND IN A MICROBIAL SYSTEM IN
###804 WHICH WE HAVE CANCER GROWING AND SO MANY PEOPLE WERE
###808 STUDYING CYTOKININS FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF TRYING
###811 TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS MIGHT BE A MODEL SYSTEM FOR
###815 HELPING US TO UNDERSTAND SOMETHING ABOUT CANCER.
###819 THESE FIRST SLIDES I WANT TO SHOW YOU NOW ARE
###821 GOING TO BE ONES THAT SHOW VARIOUS ASPECTS OF
###825 CYTOKININS. HERE IS A TISSUE CULTURE SYSTEM IN WHICH
###832 WE HAVE PITH CELLS WHICH HAVE BEEN PLACED ON TO AN
###835 AGAR MEDIUM. THIS IS ASEPTIC. AND THEN IF WE ADD
###839 VARIOUS THINGS TO THE AGAR MEDIUM, AND IN THIS CASE,
###841 IF WE ADD CYTOKININS TO THE AGAR MEDIUM WE CAN
###844 STIMULATE THE PITH CELLS TO START DIVIDING TO ENLARGE
###847 
###850 KNOWN AS CALLUS. IF IN THE CULTURE MEDIUM YOU INCLUDE
###853 A HIGH LEVEL OF CYTOKININ TO AUXIN, YOU CAN CAUSE THE
###857 PITH CELLS TO FORM SHOOTS, THIS IS A TOBACCO PLANT IN
###861 CULTURE. AND IF YOU NOW CHANGE THE RATIO SO THAT YOU
###865 HAVE HIGH LEVELS OF AUXINS TO CYTOKININS YOU CAN CAUSE
###869 THE PITH CELLS TO FORM ROOTS. A VERY PROFOUND
###872 DIFFERENCE. AND YOU CAN MAKE KIND OF A SUMMARY CHART
###875 WHERE THIS ONE THEY HAVE THE AUXIN ON THE TOP AND THE
###879 CYTOKININ ON THE SIDE. BUT THE WHOLE POINT IS THAT
###881 HIGH LEVELS OF CYTOKININ, LOW LEVELS OF AUXIN YOU GET
###884 SHOOTS. HIGH LEVELS OF AUXIN LOW LEVELS CYTOKININ YOU
###887 GET ROOTS AND IN BETWEEN YOU HAVE THIS
###889 UNDIFFERENTIATED PHASE. HERE IS A PEA PLANT NOW, THIS
###893 IS A CONTROL WITH THE APEX UP HERE. THE AXILLARY BUD
###896 WOULD BE LOCATED HERE AND WOULD BE INHIBITED FROM
###898 GROWING OUT. IF YOU ADD A DROP OF CYTOKININ TO THAT
###901 AXILLARY BUD AND YOU WAIT FOR SOME TIME, YOU OVERCOME
###904 
###907 TO GROW OUT. HERE IS WITCH'S BROOM, AGAIN, WHICH SOME
###910 OF YOU MAY HAVE SEEN. ALL OF THE AXILLARY BUDS HAVE
###912 BEEN RELEASED FROM APICAL DOMINANCE DUE TO THIS
###916 BACTERIUM. THERE IS A TUMOR OR A GALL. MOST PEOPLE
###919 CORRECTLY CALL THIS A TUMOR. TUMORS CAN GET TO BE
###922 QUITE LARGE. FOR THOSE OF YOU AGAIN WHO HAVE BEEN UP
###924 TO DAVIS LONG THE QUAD, SOME OF THE TREES WHICH LINE
###927 THE QUAD HAVE THESE LARGE TUMORS ON THEM. THEY ARE
###930 LIKELY, ALTHOUGH NOT PROVEN, TO BE A RESULT OF AN
###934 INFECTION FROM A BACTERIUM WHICH AGAIN IS EITHER
###937 ITSELF MAKES CYTOKININ OR IT IS CAUSING THE TREES
###940 NATURAL SYSTEM TO BEGIN TO MAKE CYTOKININ. OKAY, SO
###944 THESE ARE THE CYTOKININS. THEY ARE OF THE GROWTH
###947 REGULATORS WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT. THE ONES WHICH ARE
###949 MOST DIFFICULT TO STUDY. THEY ARE ONES WHICH HAVE NOT
###953 HAD A LOT OF WORK RECENTLY DONE ON THEM, BUT IT IS A
###956 FIELD WHICH IS RIPE FOR STUDY BECAUSE THERE IS SO MANY
###959 
###962 FAR WE HAVE CONSIDERED 3 GROWTH REGULATORS. AUXINS,
###965 GIBBERELLINS AND CYTOKININS. EACH OF THESE GROWTH
###969 REGULATORS ARE TRANSPORTED THROUGHOUT THE PLANT VIA
###971 THE VASCULAR SYSTEM. THE PLANT MAY MAKE THEM IN
###974 SOMEPLACE AND MAY MOVE THEM SOMEPLACE ELSE VIA THE
###976 VASCULAR SYSTEM. THIS FOURTH GROWTH REGULATOR THAT WE
###979 WANT TO TALK ABOUT NOW, UNLIKE THE PREVIOUS 3 IS NOT
###983 TRANSPORTED IN THE VASCULAR SYSTEM. AND THE REASON IT
###986 IS NOT TRANSPORTED IN THE VASCULAR SYSTEM IS BECAUSE
###988 IT IS A GAS. AND IT IS DISTRIBUTED AROUND THE PLANTS
###991 IN THE AIR. NOW HOW WAS THIS PARTICULAR GROWTH
###994 REGULATOR DISCOVERED? THE WORK WHICH BEGAN OF THE
###998 DISCOVERY OF THE GROWTH REGULATORS REALLY GOES BACK TO
###1001 THE TIME THAT HOUSES AND ROOMS WERE FIRST ILLUMINATED
###1005 WITH GAS LAMPS OR HEATED WITH GAS STOVES. PEOPLE
###1008 NOTICED THAT IN ROOMS WHICH WERE EITHER ILLUMINATED
###1012 WITH GAS LIGHT OR GAS OR HEATED WITH GAS, THAT THE
###1017 
###1019 EFFECTS. THE FIRST EFFECT SHOWED THAT THE PETALS ON
###1025 THE FLOWERS THAT WERE GROWING IN THE ROOMS DISCOLORED.
###1027 THE SECOND EFFECT WAS A NEW ONE THAT PEOPLE HADN'T
###1034 REGULARLY SEEN. THE PLANTS DISPLAYED AN UNUSUAL
###1041 PHENOMENON, AND I WILL DRAW IT FOR YOU, BUT I WANT TO
###1043 GIVE YOU THE NAME, CALLED EPINASTY. WHAT DOES
###1049 EPINASTY LOOK LIKE? IF THIS IS THE STEM AND THESE
###1056 ARE THE LEAVES, THESE ARE THE LEAVES, IN THE EPINASTY
###1063 RESPONSE WHAT WE FOUND HAPPENING WAS THAT THE LEAVES
###1069 BEGAN TO CURL BACK ON THEMSELVES. EPINASTY. LEAVES
###1076 BEGAN TO CURL BACK ON THEMSELVES. ANOTHER
###1082 CHARACTERISTIC OF THE PLANTS THAT WERE GROWING IN THE
###1084 ROOMS THAT WERE HEATED OR ILLUMINATED BY GAS WAS THAT
###1087 THE LEAVES AND THE PETALS FELL OFF OR AS BIOLOGISTS
###1097 SAY, THEY ABSCISED. THEY FELL OFF. THEY DROPPED TO
###1103 THE GROUND. NOT GOOD IF YOU WANT TO HAVE PLANTS IN
###1105 YOUR ROOM. FURTHER STUDY OF WHY THESE LEAVES OR
###1109 
###1114 IF WE DRAW HERE A STEM. A STEM. AND HERE WE
###1120 HAVE A PETIOLE. HERE WOULD BE THE BLADE. THE WHOLE
###1128 THING WOULD OBVIOUSLY BE THE LEAF. WHAT PEOPLE
###1130 NOTICED OR WHAT INVESTIGATORS NOTICED WAS THAT PRIOR
###1135 TO THE LEAVES FALLING OFF, THAT A ZONE BEGAN TO
###1143 WEAKEN. BECAME WEAK.
###1152 WHATEVER THIS GAS WAS DOING, IT
###1154 WAS PROMOTING A WEAKENING OF THIS ZONE. PROBABLY
###1158 PROMOTING SOME KIND OF ENZYMATIC ACTIVITY. AND THE
###1162 LEAVES THEN DROPPED AND THE PETALS DROPPED VERY
###1164 EASILY. BECAUSE THIS ZONE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE
###1168 FALLING OR THE ABSCISSION OF THE LEAVES AND THE PETALS
###1171 IT WAS CALLED THE ABSCISSION ZONE. THE ABSCISSION
###1177 ZONE. AND THIS GAS SEEMED TO AFFECT WHAT WAS GOING ON
###1182 IN THE ABSCISSION ZONE. NOW, FURTHER ANALYSIS OF THE
###1189 GAS THEN WAS UNDERTAKEN TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT
###1192 WAS THAT WAS CAUSING ALL OF THESE EFFECTS. AND, FROM
###1195 THIS WORK THE DISCOVERY WAS MADE OF THE FOURTH PLANT
###1200 
###1209 A GAS. PEOPLE FOUND THAT IN THE ROOMS THAT THEY LIVED
###1216 IN IF THEY CONTAINED THE GAS THAT THEY USED, CONTAINED
###1221 ETHYLENE, THAT WE SAW ALL OF THESE EFFECTS, EXCEPT IN
###1226 ONE HOUSEPLANT THAT PEOPLE HAD THEY DIDN'T SEE THE
###1229 EFFECTS. WHEREAS, ALL OF THE OTHER PLANTS IN THE
###1232 ROOMS WERE LOSING THEIR LEAVES AND THE PETALS WERE
###1234 FALLING OFF. THIS PLANT UP HERE IN FRONT KNOWN AS
###1238 THE CAST IRON PLANT, SEEMED NOT TO BE EFFECTED BY THE
###1244 ETHYLENE, BY WHAT WAS IN THE GAS. THEREFORE, IN
###1248 PROPER VICTORIAN HOMES WHICH WERE HEATED AND
###1251 ILLUMINATED BY GASLIGHT THIS WAS THE ONLY PLANT THAT
###1254 COULD BE FOUND. AND IF YOU PICTURES OF VICTORIANS
###1257 HOME THAT ARE ILLUMINATED BY GASLIGHT THIS SHOULD BE
###1260 THE ONLY PLANT THAT SHOULD BE GROWING IN THOSE HOUSES.
###1262 CALLED THE CAST IRON PLANT. AND IT APPEARS NOT TO BE
###1267 SUSCEPTIBLE OR NOT TO BE SENSITIVE TO THE COMPOUND
###1271 WHICH WAS ETHYLENE. ETHYLENE TURNED OUT TO BE THEN
###1274 
###1277 THEIR HOUSES. AND AFTER IT WAS DISCOVERED, IT WAS
###1281 THEN FOUND TO HAVE PROFOUND EFFECTS ON DEVELOPMENT AND
###1284 WE NOW CONSIDER IT A FOURTH PLANT GROWTH REGULATOR.
###1288 NOT ONLY IS IT A FOURTH PLANT GROWTH REGULATOR, BUT IT
###1290 IS THE MOST IMPORTANT COMMERCIALLY OF ALL OF THE
###1293 GROWTH REGULATORS THAT WE WILL TALK ABOUT HERE. AND,
###1295 IT IS THE ONE WHICH IMPACTS DAILY ON YOUR LIVES. I
###1299 WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT
###1300 ETHYLENE DOES.
###1304 PROBABLY, THE MAJOR ASPECT OR THE MAJOR WAY
###1306 ETHYLENE IMPACTS ON YOUR LIFE IS THAT IT AFFECTS OR WE
###1312 COULD EVEN SAY STIMULATES FRUIT RIPENING. AND
###1322 THEREFORE, BECAUSE IT AFFECTS FRUIT RIPENING BECAUSE
###1325 FRUITS ARE A MAJOR PART OF OUR DIETS THIS PARTICULAR
###1328 SUBSTANCE GAINED A LARGE AMOUNT OF ATTENTION. NOT
###1333 ONLY CAN ETHYLENE AFFECT FRUIT RIPENING, BUT IT
###1337 AFFECTS IT IN A VERY UNUSUAL NUMBER OF WAYS. AND ONE
###1341 
###1343 CHARACTERISTIC THAT ETHYLENE, WHICH I WILL ABBREVIATE
###1347 AS E, ETHYLENE STIMULATES ITS OWN FORMATION. THAT IS,
###1359 IT IS AUTOCATALYTIC.
###1366 STIMULATES ITS OWN FORMATION.
###1370 IF YOU HAVE A FRUIT WHICH IS OVER RIPE, AND IS
###1376 PRODUCING ETHYLENE, IF YOU HAVE A FRUIT THAT IS
###1383 PRODUCING ETHYLENE, IT WILL CAUSE THAT FRUIT TO MAKE
###1388 MORE ETHYLENE. IT WILL MAKE MORE ETHYLENE. IT THE
###1391 AUTOCATALYTIC. SO, IF YOU HAVE A DAMAGED APPLE OR AN
###1395 OVER RIPE APPLE, IT IS IN THE VICINITY OF OTHER FRUITS
###1400 WHICH ARE NOT RIPE OR NOT DAMAGED, THIS CAN CAUSE THE
###1404 OTHER FRUITS TO BEGIN TO MAKE ETHYLENE AND TO SPOIL
###1408 VERY QUICKLY. AND THIS IS THE BASIS FOR THE SAYING,
###1413 THAT ONE ROTTEN OR ONE OVERRIPE APPLE WILL SPOIL THE
###1416 BARREL. IT IS THAT ONE APPLE WHICH IS PRODUCING
###1420 A LARGE AMOUNT OF ETHYLENE, IF IT IS IN THE VICINITY
###1422 OF OTHER FRUITS THAT ARE OTHERWISE HEALTHY AND NOT YET
###1425 RIPE WILL CAUSE THOSE OTHER FRUITS TO START MAKING
###1428 
###1431 TO OVERRIPEN. ETHYLENE HAS WIDE APPLICATIONS. WE
###1436 KNOW THAT IT IS INVOLVED IN THE RIPENING OF A LARGE
###1439 NUMBER OF FRUITS. AND JUST TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF
###1443 A COUPLE OF THE FRUITS THAT MANY OF YOU ARE FAMILIAR
###1446 WITH. MANY CITRUS; ORANGE, GRAPEFRUIT, LEMONS, A LOT
###1457 OF SQUASH FRUITS AND APPLES. ALL OF THESE FRUITS HAVE
###1465 THEIR RIPENING AFFECTED BY ETHYLENE. THE RIPENING
###1470 PROCESS CAN BE GREATLY SPEEDED UP IF THERE IS ETHYLENE
###1474 PRESENT. AND MANY OF YOU KNOW WHEN YOU GO TO THE
###1477 STORE, ESPECIALLY IF YOU GET TO THE PRODUCE MARKET
###1479 EARLY IN THE MORNING, AND YOU ARE ONE OF THE FIRST
###1481 SHOPPERS THERE. TO GO OVER TO THE BANANA'S AND YOU
###1483 KIND OF SURREPTITIOUSLY TOUCH THE BANANAS, YOU WILL
###1486 FIND THAT THEY'RE WARM. NOT ONLY ARE THEY WARM, BUT
###1490 MOST OF THE BANANA'S ARE GREEN WHEN YOU GET THEM NOW
###1492 IN THE STORES IN BERKELEY AND THAT IS BECAUSE
###1494 BANANA'S, WHICH ARE ANOTHER FRUIT THAT IS AFFECTED BY
###1499 
###1504 THEN THE PRODUCE LADY OR MAN PRIOR TO PUTTING THE
###1509 BANANA'S OUT FOR YOU TO EAT TAKES THE BANANA'S AND
###1514 PUTS THEM IN A ROOM AND GASSES THEM WITH ETHYLENE.
###1518 AND WHEN THIS IS DONE, THIS TRIGGERS THE RIPENING
###1521 PROCESS AND CAUSES THE BANANA'S TO BEGIN TO RIPEN.
###1524 THE STARCH THEN IN THE BANANA IS CONVERTED TO THE
###1527 SUGARS. AND THIS IS WHY IF YOU HAVE A BANANA AND IT
###1530 IS NOT RIPE, IF YOU TAKE AN APPLE, AN OVERRIPE APPLE,
###1534 OR IN THIS CASE TAKE A DAMAGED APPLE BECAUSE THIS ALSO
###1537 AS YOU WILL SEE STIMULATES ETHYLENE. YOU TAKE THE
###1539 APPLE AND YOU PUT IT IN A BAG AND THEN TAKE THE GREEN
###1544 BANANA AND PUT IT IN THE BAG AND THEN CLOSE THE BAG SO
###1548 THAT THE ETHYLENE GAS CAN ACCUMULATE, YOU CAN ACTUALLY
###1552 CAUSE THE BANANA TO RIPEN AND VERY QUICKLY GET
###1555 SOMETHING LIKE THIS, WHICH IS VERY BROWN AND IN WHICH
###1558 THE SUGARS HAVE BEEN FORMED AS A RESULT OF THE STARCH
###1561 DISAPPEARING. SO THIS IS A VERY PRACTICAL EXAMPLE.
###1564 
###1568 EXAMPLE OF ETHYLENE'S RESULTS ARE FOUND IN SOME OF
###1571 THESE FRUITS; YOU GUYS KNOW THESE AS KIWI'S AND
###1573 AVOCADO'S. THESE ARE TWO FRUITS WHICH MOST OF YOU, AT
###1577 LEAST WE CAN GROW KIWI'S PRETTY WELL IN THE BAY AREA,
###1580 AND IN SOME PLACES WE CAN GROW AVOCADO'S. IF YOU
###1582 LEAVE THEM ON THE PLANT THEY GENERAL DON'T RIPEN OR
###1585 THEY DON'T RIPEN UNTIL THE FRUIT'S BEGIN TO DRY AND
###1587 ARE NO LONG ERE GOOD TO EAT. THE REASON THEY DON'T
###1590 RIPEN IS BECAUSE THERE IS NO ETHYLENE PRODUCTION OR
###1593 VERY LITTLE ETHYLENE PRODUCTION CARRYING ON IN THE
###1595 FRUIT. BUT, BY PICKING THESE FRUITS YOU ARE DAMAGING
###1598 THEIR ENDS BY BREAKING THEM OFF OF THE PLANT, AND THAT
###1601 DAMAGE ACTUALLY STARTS ETHYLENE PRODUCTION AND CAUSES
###1604 THE RIPENING OF THE FRUITS. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT
###1607 EFFECT OF ETHYLENE IN CONTROLLING RIPENING YOUR
###1609 FRUITS.
###1610 NOW, BECAUSE ETHYLENE IS SO IMPORTANT IN THE
###1618 OF PEOPLE
###1618 HAVE PUT A LOT OF TIME INTO TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW
###1621 WE CAN PROLONG THE SHELF LIFE THE FRUITS BY TREATING
###1624 FRUITS WITH ETHYLENE OR BY PREVENTING ETHYLENE
###1626 ACCUMULATING. YOU SHOULD REALIZE THAT ETHYLENE IS
###1629 A NATURALLY OCCURRING COMPOUND. WE HAVE BEEN EXPOSED
###1632 TO IT ALL OF OUR EVOLUTION AS HUMANS. SO IT IS NOT
###1634 SOMETHING THAT HAS TO BE REGULATED BY THE GOVERNMENT.
###1637 WHAT WAS FOUND, WAS THAT IN TRYING TO UNDERSTAND HOW
###1641 ETHYLENE CAUSES RIPENING, AND HOW WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO
###1645 SLOW DOWN RIPENING, SURE YOU COULD STORE THESE
###1648 BANANA'S IN A ROOM AND CONSTANTLY CHANGE THE AIR IN
###1652 THE ROOM TO PREVENT THE ACCUMULATION OF ETHYLENE AND
###1655 THERE BY PREVENT THE AUTOCATALYTIC RESPONSE. OR
###1657 PERHAPS THERE WAS ANOTHER WAY, A MORE ECONOMICAL WAY.
###1660 AND SO WHAT WORKERS WERE ABLE TO FIND IS THAT IF YOU
###1663 STORED BANANA'S AND MANY FRUITS IN ROOMS WHICH CONTAIN
###1668 5 TO 10 PERCENT CO2 THAT YOU COULD INHIBIT RIPENING.
###1677 
###1684 OUR GLOBE TODAY, BUT IT WILL CHANGE TOMORROW, SURELY
###1688 THAT THE NORMAL CO2 LEVELS ARE 0.03 TO 0.04 PERCENT.
###1695 SO, WE ARE GREATLY INCREASING THE ATMOSPHERE WITH CO2
###1699 AROUND THESE FRUITS THAT ARE IN STORAGE. AND WHEN YOU
###1703 STORE FRUITS IN AN ATMOSPHERE THAT HAS 5 TO 10 PERCENT
###1706 CO2, WHAT APPEARS TO HAPPEN IS THAT THE PROCESSES
###1713 AFFECTED BY ETHYLENE ARE SLOWED DOWN OR INHIBITED.
###1730 MAY BE THAT THE RECEPTOR FOR THE ETHYLENE ALSO BINDS
###1734 CO2 SO THAT THE TWO GASSES COMPETE FOR THE SAME
###1737 RECEPTOR. THIS IS THE BASIS THEN FOR BEING ABLE TO
###1742 PROLONG THE SHELF LIFE OF MANY FRUITS BY MANIPULATING
###1745 THE ATMOSPHERE. THERE ARE ALSO PROBLEMS HOWEVER, AND
###1747 SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE ENCOUNTERED THIS. IF FRUITS ARE
###1749 STORED FOR TOO LONG IN A CO2 ATMOSPHERE OR IN TOO HIGH
###1753 CO2, AND I WILL SHOW YOU A PICTURE OF THIS, THEY CAN
###1755 BE DAMAGED. AND SO SOME OF YOU I KNOW I HAVE, HAVE
###1758 CUT OPEN APPLES AND FOUND THEM LOOKING GOOD ON THE
###1761 
###1764 ON THE INSIDE IS AN INDICATION THAT THEY WERE STORED
###1767 EITHER FOR TOO LONG OR TOO MUCH OF A TIME IN AN
###1770 ETHYLENE ATMOSPHERE. VERY IMPORTANT GROWTH REGULATOR.
###1774 THE OTHER POINT I WANTED TO MENTION WITH REGARD TO
###1776 ETHYLENE AND MANY OF YOU ARE AWARE OF THIS, IS THAT
###1779 WHEN YOU RECEIVE FLOWERS, FOR EXAMPLE, VALENTINE'S DAY
###1782 IS COMING UP. YOU FREQUENTLY RECEIVE A LITTLE PACKET
###1784 OF POWDER WITH THE FLOWERS WHICH YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO
###1788 PUT INTO THE LIQUID AND TO PROLONG THE SHELF LIFE OF
###1791 THE FLOWERS. THESE PACKETS CONTAIN RELATIVELY
###1794 INNOCUOUS COMPOUNDS WHICH AS THE CO2 DOES COMPETE WITH
###1800 OR SOMEHOW RETARDED THE EFFECT OF ETHYLENE AND
###1803 THEREBY, PROLONG THE LIFE OF THE FLOWERS. YOU CAN
###1806 ALSO, BY THE WAY, TAKE AN ASPIRIN AND PUT AN ASPIRIN
###1809 IN THE WATER BECAUSE ASPIRIN ITSELF, THE COMPOUND
###1813 SALICYLIC ACID ALSO COMPETES OR IN SOME WAY INHIBITS
###1816 THE ETHYLENE RIPENING OR THE ETHYLENE MATURING PROCESS
###1819 
###1822 THESE FLOWERS. NOW, ANOTHER ASPECT OF ETHYLENE, WHICH
###1826 WE WANT TO CONSIDER, IS THAT IN SOME CROPS WHICH ALSO
###1829 MAKES ETHYLENE COMMERCIALLY IMPORTANT, AND THE ONES
###1831 THAT I WANT TO MENTION TO YOU ARE PINEAPPLE
###1837 AND MANGOS. THESE CROPS YOU CAN STIMULATE THEM TO
###1843 FLOWER
###1851 WITH ETHYLENE. AND SO, FOR A FARMER THIS CAN
###1855 COMMERCIALLY BE A VERY IMPORTANT ADDED BONUS TO HIS OR
###1859 HER CROPS BECAUSE YOU CAN CAUSE ALL OF THE PLANTS TO
###1862 FLOWER AT ONE TIME. ALL OF THEM TO SET FRUIT AT ONE
###1865 TIME AND THEN YOU CAN HARVEST THEM ALL AT ONE TIME.
###1867 SO, FOR SOME PLANTS YOU CAN STIMULATE FLOWERING WITH
###1870 ETHYLENE. IN CALIFORNIA, WE DON'T NORMALLY
###1873 GROW MANGO AND PINEAPPLES BUT ETHYLENE STILL SERVES
###1876 BESIDES CONTROLLING FRUIT RIPENING, ANOTHER VERY
###1879 IMPORTANT, EXTREMELY IMPORTANT PROCESS. IN THE
###1883 CENTRAL VALLEY, IF YOU GUYS GO THROUGH THE CENTRAL
###1885 VALLEY IN THE FALL AND YOU HAPPEN TO PASS A CHERRY
###1888 
###1891 VERY LABOR INTENSIVE AS FAR AS HARVESTING THE FRUIT.
###1895 IF YOU TREAT THOSE TREES WITH A COMPOUND WHICH
###1898 STIMULATES NATURAL ETHYLENE PRODUCTION IN THESE
###1901 PLANTS, IN THE WALNUT PLANT OR IN THE CHERRY PLANTS,
###1904 WHAT THIS DOES IS IT ACTIVATES THE ABSCISSION ZONE.
###1914 ACTIVATES THE ABSCISSION ZONE. SO THESE CHERRY FRUITS
###1918 AND WALNUTS ARE ALREADY JUST SORT OF WEAKLY ATTACHED
###1921 TO THE PLANT. THEY ARE VERY TENUOUS AS FAR AS THEIR
###1924 ATTACHMENT. AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS IS, THE FARMER WILL
###1927 SPREAD A TARP BENEATH THE TREES THAT HAVE BEEN TREATED
###1930 WITH THE ETHYLENE INDUCING COMPOUND AND TAKE
###1934 A MACHINE, WHICH LOOKS LIKE SOMETHING FROM THE SCIENCE
###1936 FICTION MOVIE, WHICH HAS TWO BIG CLAWS ON IT. AND THE
###1940 MACHINE COVERS THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF THE TREE AND
###1942 SHAKES THE TREE AND IN THE PROCESS THE FRUITS ARE
###1946 PICKED, SO TO SPEAK, AND THEY FALL DOWN ON THE GROUND.
###1948 AND THIS SAVES A LOT OF LABOR AND A LOT OF TIME AND
###1951 
###1954 IF YOU HAD TO PICK THEM INDIVIDUALLY. LET ME SHOW YOU
###1957 NOW SOME PICTURES OF ETHYLENE. AND LET'S GET THIS
###1961 BACK HERE AGAIN. WE SEEM TO BE --
###1973 OKAY. SO, THIS
###1976 FIRST SLIDE IS MEANT TO SHOW YOU EPINASTY WHICH OCCURS
###1981 IN PLANTS TREATED WITH ETHYLENE. HERE IS THE NORMAL
###1985 PLANT. THAT WOULD BE THE KIND OF SITUATION YOU WOULD
###1987 SEE IN PLANTS IN WHICH THE GAS IN THE ROOM WAS
###1991 CONTAMINATED WITH ETHYLENE. HERE IS THE CAST IRON
###1994 PLANT. AGAIN, IF A MOVIE IS SUPPOSED TO BE AS REAL AS
###1998 IT IS AS FAR AS THE SETTING FOR VICTORIAN HOME, THIS
###2001 IS THE ONLY PLANT THAT YOU SHOULD FIND GROWING IN THAT
###2004 PARTICULAR SITUATION. HERE ARE BANANA'S, AGAIN
###2006 BANANA'S ARE PICKED AS MOST OF YOU KNOW, GREEN. AND
###2009 THEN THEY ARE HELD IN CO2 ATMOSPHERE, CO2 ENRICHED
###2013 ATMOSPHERE, REMOVED FROM THAT ATMOSPHERE BEFORE THEY
###2016 ARE TO BE PUT OUT AND THEN TREATED WITH ETHYLENE. AND
###2019 THE LAST SLIDE I WANT TO SHOW YOU ARE APPLES WHICH
###2022 
###2025 WHICH THE CO2 CONCENTRATION WAS EITHER NOT WELL
###2028 REGULATED OR THE APPLES WERE LEFT TOO LONG IN THIS
###2031 ATMOSPHERE AND THIS IS THE TYPE OF DAMAGE THAT YOU
###2033 WOULD SEE IN THOSE SORTS OF FRUITS. SO, IF ANY OF YOU
###2036 HAVE EVER ENCOUNTERED ANYTHING LIKE THIS, THESE ARE
###2038 A RESULT MOST LIKELY OF HIGH LEVELS OF CO2 IN THE
###2042 ATMOSPHERE. OKAY. SO, THAT IS THE FOURTH GROUP OF
###2050 GROWTH REGULATORS, A VERY IMPORTANT GROUP. THE MOST
###2052 IMPORTANT COMMERCIALLY OF ALL OF THE REGULATORS THAT
###2054 WE WILL CONTINUE WITH. FINALLY, IN THE LAST 15 OR 20
###2058 MINUTES I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE LAST GROUP OF
###2060 GROWTH REGULATORS. IT HAS A VERY INTERESTING HISTORY
###2063 OF DISCOVERY. AND THIS GROWTH REGULATED GROUP WAS
###2066 DISCOVERED TWICE INDEPENDENTLY AT THE SAME TIME. AND
###2070 LET ME TELL YOU ABOUT THE TWO DIFFERENT GROUPS THAT
###2073 DISCOVERED IT AT THE SAME TIME. THE FIRST GROUP THAT
###2076 DISCOVERED IT WAS IN WALES, IN THE UNITED KINGDOM.
###2079 
###2083 DORMANT BUDS, WHICH YOU CAN JUST SEE NOW BEGINNING TO
###2085 BURST ON THE OUTSIDE, DORMANT BUDS COULD BE CAUSE TO
###2090 BURST PREMATURELY, THAT IS, THE LEAVES COULD BE CAUSE
###2093 TO COME OUT PREMATURELY IF YOU REMOVE THE SCALES THAT
###2097 WERE COVERING OVER THE END OF THE BUD. SO, THESE
###2100 SCALES THEY HYPOTHESIZE CONTAIN SOME COMPOUNDS, SOME
###2104 SOLUTION, SOME MATERIAL WHICH KEPT THE BUDS DORMANT.
###2108 AND, WHEN THEY EXTRACTED, AND HERE IS ONE IN WHICH THE
###2112 BUD SCALES HAVE BEEN REMOVED AND THINGS ARE BEGINNING
###2114 TO COME OUT, WHEN THESE INDIVIDUALS IN WALES
###2117 EXTRACTED, THEY COLLECTED A LOT OF SCALES FROM THESE
###2119 BUDS, AND EXTRACTED THEM, THEY FOUND A COMPOUND WHICH
###2124 WHEN APPLIED BACK TO THE PLANT COULD KEEP IT DORMANT.
###2128 AND THEY CALLED THIS COMPOUND DORMIN BECAUSE IT KEPT
###2136 OR MAINTAINED DORMANCY.
###2145 NOW WHILE THEY WERE CARRYING
###2146 OUT THIS WORK IN WALES, FARMERS IN DAVIS FOR THE
###2150 CENTRAL VALLEY OF CALIFORNIA BECAME INCREASINGLY
###2156 WAS
###2156 ASSOCIATED WITH THE INCREASE PLANTING OF COTTON. WHAT
###2159 FARMERS FOUND WAS THAT IN JUNE OF EVERY YEAR THE
###2164 COTTON BOWLS, THAT IS, THE THINGS WHICH KEPT ALL THE
###2167 COTTON HAIRS TOGETHER INSIDE. COTTON BOWLS WOULD FALL
###2171 OFF OF THE PLANT. THEY WOULD LOSE 10 TO 30 PERCENT OF
###2174 THESE COTTON BOWLS IN JUNE. SO CALLED JUNE DROP. AND
###2181 THEY WERE CONCERNED OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE IT DECREASED THE
###2183 AMOUNT OF COTTON, WHICH THEY HARVESTED AND THEREFORE,
###2186 DECREASED HOW MUCH MONEY THEY GOT. AND SO, THEY
###2189 BROUGHT THIS PROBLEM TO PEOPLE AT DAVIS, U C DAVIS,
###2193 AND THEY ASKED THEM, COULD THEY HELP TO DETERMINE WHAT
###2196 IT WAS THAT WAS CAUSING THESE COTTON BOWLS TO DROP TO
###2200 THE GROUND, THIS SO CALLED JUNE DROP. AND THE PEOPLE
###2202 AT DAVIS DISCOVERED THAT PRIOR, JUST PRIOR TO THE
###2207 FALLING OF THE COTTON FROM THE PLANTS, THAT A COMPOUND
###2210 WAS INCREASING IN THE PLANT AND THAT THIS COMPOUND
###2214 WHEN APPLIED BACK TO THE PLANT AFTER IT WAS EXTRACTED
###2216 
###2221 OFF. AND BECAUSE THESE FALLING OFF IS THE SAME AS
###2226 ABSCISING, THIS COMPOUND WHICH THEY ISOLATED IT AND
###2233 IDENTIFIED WAS KNOWN AS ABSCISING. THIS COMPOUND
###2234 WHICH THEY ISOLATED AND IDENTIFIED WAS KNOWN AS
###2234 ABSCISIC ACID. THIS COMPOUND WHICH CAUSED THE COTTON
###2241 BOWLS TO FALL OFF. AND WE NOW KNOW THAT ABSCISIC ACID
###2247 AND DORMIN ARE THE SAME COMPOUND. THEY ARE COMPOUNDS
###2253 WHICH IN THIS CASE CAUSE THE COTTON'S TO ABSCISE AND
###2258 IN THE CASE OF THE DORMANT TO MAINTAIN DORMANCY.
###2263 ABSCISIC ACID IS A 5TH GROWTH REGULATOR. AND PROBABLY
###2269 IF WE HAD TO SUMMARIZE WHERE IT WORKS MOST OR WHAT ITS
###2272 EFFECTS ARE, WE COULD SAY THAT ABSCISIC ACID, WHICH I
###2276 WILL ABBREVIATE AS ABA ABSCISIC ACID, IS A GROWTH
###2282 REGULATOR INVOLVED WITH RESPONSES TO PLANTS TO STRESS.
###2304 AND LET ME GIVE YOU SOME EXAMPLES NOW OF THE RESPONSES
###2309 OF PLANTS TO STRESS. LET'S LOOK AT A PLANT WHICH IS
###2313 GROWING IN SOIL IN WHICH THE WATER IS GRADUALLY BEING
###2318 
###2323 IS GROWING IN SOIL AND WE NOW HAVE, FIRST OF ALL, THE
###2327 DEPLETION OF WATER. DEPLETION OF WATER IN THE SOIL.
###2337 NOW, IN THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION WE KNOW THAT WATER
###2341 IS GOING LIKE THIS, AND WE WILL TALK ABOUT THIS MORE,
###2345 AND IS EXITING THE PLANT THROUGH THE LEAVES, THROUGH
###2347 THE STOMATA.
###2356 WATER LEAVES. NOW, IF THE PLANT DID NOT
###2358 HAVE ANY WAY OF CONTROLLING WATER THAT IT WAS LOSING,
###2364 BECAUSE IT IS NOT BEING ABLE TO REPLACE IT FROM THE
###2367 SOIL, THAT PLANT WOULD DRY, WOULD DRY OUT. SO, WHEN
###2372 THERE IS A DEPLETION OF WATER IN THE SOIL, THIS IS
###2375 SENSED BY THE ROOTS, WHICH MAKE ABA. MAKE ABA.
###2388 THIS ABA MOVES TO THIS STOMATA AND CAUSES THEM TO
###2398 CLOSE.
###2406 AND THEREBY, PREVENT THE PLANT FROM DRYING
###2408 OUT. THERE ARE A LOT OF MUTANT PLANTS AND ONE OF THE
###2415 MUTANT PLANTS IS CALLED DROOPY. IN DROOPY, THIS PLANT
###2421 CANNOT MAKE ABA. CAN'T MAKE ABA. SO IF YOU PUT A
###2434 PLANT LIKE THAT IN SOIL WHICH IS DEPLETED IN ITS
###2438 
###2442 CAN'T TELL THEM TO CLOSE BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE THAT
###2445 SIGNAL TO MAKE. AND THOSE PLANTS THEN LOOK WILTED.
###2448 HOWEVER, IF YOU TAKE DROOPY AND YOU SPRAY IT
###2451 WITH ABA YOU CAN GET THAT PLANT THEN TO ILLUSTRATE OR
###2455 TO SHOW A NORMAL RESPONSE TO THE ENVIRONMENT. ANOTHER
###2460 WAY IN WHICH ABA SEEMS TO BE INVOLVED IN STRESS IS IN
###2465 PLANTS THAT ARE GROWING IN SOILS THAT ARE VERY SALTY.
###2468 IN CALIFORNIA, AND IN MANY PORTIONS OF THE WORLD A
###2472 LARGE AMOUNT OF AGRICULTURAL LAND IS BEING LOST TO THE
###2475 FACT THAT SALT WATER IS COMING IN OR SALTS ARE
###2478 ACCUMULATING IN THE SOILS AND THIS IS PREVENTING THE
###2481 PLANTS TO GROW. WE ARE LOSING A LARGE AMOUNT OF
###2483 AGRICULTURAL LAND THAT WAY. ABA IN PLANTS THAT ARE
###2488 EXPOSED TO THE SALTY ENVIRONMENT, ABA SEEMS TO
###2491 TRIGGER, SO IN A SALTY ENVIRONMENT
###2501 TRIGGERS THE
###2504 PRODUCTION OF PROTEINS
###2512 ALLOWING PLANTS TO RESIST THIS
###2517 ENVIRONMENT OR AT LEAST TO TOLERATE IT. PERHAPS THE
###2534 
###2539 INTERESTING HAS TO DO WITH SEED GERMINATION. MOST OF
###2546 YOU KNOW THAT THE SEED IS FORMED AT THE END OF THE
###2550 GROWING SEASON AND THEN USUALLY THE CLIMATE CHANGES
###2554 SOMEHOW. IF YOU COME FROM THE EAST, THE CLIMATE GETS
###2557 REALLY COLD. HERE IT GETS COLD BUT NOT AS COLD AS THE
###2560 EAST. AND SO, WE VIEW THE SEED AS A WAY OF ALLOWING
###2563 THE PLANT TO PASS THROUGH THIS BAD PERIOD OF TIME WHEN
###2567 GROWTH WOULD NOT NORMALLY OCCUR. THE PLANT REMAINS
###2570 DORMANT. BUT THERE HAS TO BE SOME WAY FOR THAT SEED
###2573 TO KNOW THAT THE COLD PERIOD HAS NOW GONE PAST AND
###2579 THAT THE CLIMATE OUTSIDE CAN ALLOW THE SEED TO
###2581 GERMINATE AND TO GROW. AND THIS IS WHERE ABA HAS
###2584 A VERY STRONG EFFECT. WHAT WE FIND IS THAT IN SEED
###2589 COATS FOLLOWING ABA AND OTHER RELATED COMPOUNDS ARE AT
###2614 HIGH LEVELS.
###2620 HIGH LEVELS. AND THIS INHIBITS
###2623 GERMINATION. AND WHAT HAPPENS, APPARENTLY, IS THAT
###2634 COLD OR PERIODS OF COLD YIELD A BREAKDOWN IN ABA. AND
###2651 
###2654 THE ABA LEVELS AND THE OTHER INHIBITOR LEVELS HAVE
###2657 DROPPED TO SUCH A CONCENTRATION THAT GERMINATION CAN
###2660 NOW GO ON. SOME OF US HERE IN CALIFORNIA RECEIVE
###2664 SEEDS WHICH NORMALLY WOULD GROW IN A COLD CLIMATE AND
###2667 WE ARE TOLD THAT IF WE WANT TO GET THOSE SEEDS TO
###2670 GERMINATE WE HAVE TO ALSO GIVE THEM ALONG PERIOD OF
###2673 COLD. WE ARE TOLD TO PUT THEM IN A REFRIGERATOR OR
###2676 FREEZER. THIS PROCESS OF COLD TREATMENT IS CALLED
###2684 STRATEGY STRATIFICATION AND BASICALLY, YOU ARE DOING
###2691 THE SAME THING THAT THE COLD NORMALLY WOULD DO BY
###2695 KEEPING YOUR SEEDS IN THE REFRIGERATOR YOU ARE CAUSING
###2698 THESE INHIBITORY COMPOUNDS INCLUDING ABA TO GRADUALLY
###2702 BE REDUCED. I WANT TO MENTION TO YOU THAT THIS SAME
###2706 KIND OF SYSTEM OPERATES IN PLANTS WHICH GROW IN
###2709 ENVIRONMENTS THAT ARE NOT NECESSARILY COLD. LIKE FOR
###2711 EXAMPLE, THE DESERT. IN THE DESERT THE BIG ISSUE OF
###2715 A SEED GETTING STARTED IS HAVING ENOUGH WATER. HOW IS
###2719 
###2722 ALLOW IT TO ESTABLISH ITS ROOT SYSTEM? IN THIS
###2725 PARTICULAR SITUATION WHAT HAPPENS IS THAT, HERE IS THE
###2731 SEED AND THE SEED COAT, THE INHIBITOR IS IN THE
###2736 COAT, INHIBITOR IS IN THE COAT, AND THEN WHAT HAPPENS
###2741 IS THAT IF THE RAIN IS A SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH RAIN TO
###2745 ALLOW THE SEED TO ESTABLISH ITSELF, IT IS ALSO
###2751 A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF RAIN TO HAVE WASHED OUT THE
###2755 INHIBITOR. SO, IF WE CAN WASH OUT THE INHIBITOR, THAT
###2759 IS TELLING THE SEED THERE IS ENOUGH WATER TO
###2761 GERMINATE, ENOUGH WATER TO ESTABLISH YOURSELF. NOW,
###2765 THERE ARE WAYS OF TRICKING THE SYSTEM IN THE DESERT
###2768 AND THIS SOMETIMES HAPPENS. IF YOU HAVE A LOT OF
###2771 SHORT RAINS, TINY RAINS, AND EACH ONE OF THEM WASHES
###2775 OUT A BIT OF THE INHIBITOR BUT NOT ALL OF IT,
###2778 EVENTUALLY YOU WILL HAVE WASHED OUT MOST OR A LARGE
###2781 AMOUNT OF THE INHIBITOR AND THE SEED THINKS THAT IT IS
###2784 TIME TO GERMINATE. AND UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES THE
###2786 
###2789 FOR IT TO ESTABLISH ITSELF. BUT IN GENERAL, THIS
###2792 SYSTEM WORKS WELL IN TELLING THE SEED TO GERMINATE
###2795 WHEN THERE IS AN ADEQUATE AMOUNT OF WATER. FINALLY, I
###2798 WANT TO MENTION ONE OTHER ASPECT OF SEED GERMINATION
###2801 CONTROLLED BY ABA AND OTHER INHIBITORS. SOME OF YOU
###2804 MAY HAVE PURCHASED CORN BEFORE IN THE STORE AND AFTER
###2807 YOU OPEN THE HUSK UP AND YOU FIND THE EAR, WHEN YOU
###2810 LOOK INSIDE ON THE COB YOU WOULD SEE SOMETIMES THERE
###2814 IS SEEDS THAT ARE ACTUALLY GERMINATING. THEY ARE
###2816 REALLY FRUITS IN WHICH THE SEEDS GERMINATE DIRECTLY ON
###2819 THE COB OR THE EAR. IN THESE PARTICULAR PLANTS FOR
###2823 WHATEVER REASON, THEY HAVE ESCAPED DORMANCY ON
###2826 INHIBITION TO GERMINATION BY ABA OR OTHER GROWTH
###2830 REGULATORS AND WE CALL THIS PRECOCIOUS GERMINATION
###2833 VIVIPARY. WE CALL THIS PRECOCIOUS
###2838 GERMINATION VIVIPARY. IT IS A FAIRLY COMMON CURRENCY
###2845 ON MANY PLANTS AND IT USUALLY, IF YOU SEE IT, IS
###2847 
###2853 INHIBITION SYSTEM FOR GERMINATION. LET ME SHOW YOU
###2857 SOME PICTURES NOW. THE FIRST ONE IS GOING TO JUST
###2859 REMIND YOU OF THE COTTON BOWL AND THESE WERE THE
###2863 THINGS THAT FELL OFF IN JUNE THAT THE FARMER'S THEN
###2865 BROUGHT TO THE PEOPLE AT DAVIS TO ALLOW THEM TO TRY
###2869 AND FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON. HERE ARE THE
###2871 DORMANT BUDS. THESE ARE WHERE THE DORMIN WAS
###2874 EXTRACTED FROM. THESE PARTICULAR BUDS SCALES FROM THE
###2877 OUTSIDE. AND AGAIN DORMIN AND ABA TURN OUT TO BE THE
###2880 SAME. HERE IS A SEEDLING GERMINATING. PRESUMABLY THE
###2884 SEED COAT WOULD HAVE IN IT INHIBITORS WHICH HAVE TO BE
###2887 REDUCED BY COLD AND THAT REDUCTION IN THE INHIBITOR
###2892 LEVEL TELLS THE SEED THAT IT IS TIME TO GERMINATE.
###2894 HERE IS VIVIPARY. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO HAVE EVER BEEN
###2897 TO A MANGROVE SWAMP AND LOOKED AT SOME OF THE
###2900 MANGROVES, THESE THINGS HANGING FROM THE MANGROVES, I
###2902 WILL SHOW YOU A PICTURE OF THIS NOW, THIS IS THE FRUIT
###2906 
###2909 AS THE FRUIT, AFTER POLLINATION, WHILE IT IS STILL
###2912 ATTACHED TO THE TREE THE SEEDLING GERMINATES. THERE
###2915 IS NO PERIOD OF DORMANCY AND THIS IS KNOWN
###2918 AS VIVIPARY. OKAY. I WILL SEE YOU GUYS ALL ON
###2922 MONDAY. HAVE A NICE WEEKEND.
