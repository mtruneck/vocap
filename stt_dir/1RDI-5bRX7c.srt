1
0:0:1,267 --> 0:0:2,868
TRAVIS:
Now on Rocket City Rednecks...


2
0:0:2,868 --> 0:0:5,4
We become doomsday preppers


3
0:0:5,4 --> 0:0:7,239
as we create a portable
apocalypse shelter


4
0:0:7,239 --> 0:0:9,508
that's bulletproof.


5
0:0:9,508 --> 0:0:12,244
But when local marauders
try to take us on...


6
0:0:12,244 --> 0:0:13,779
Take cover, everybody,
take cover.


7
0:0:13,779 --> 0:0:18,184
Can we survive our own
homegrown Armageddon?


8
0:0:18,184 --> 0:0:19,418
Oh, oh!


9
0:0:19,418 --> 0:0:20,886
I'm Travis Taylor.


10
0:0:20,886 --> 0:0:22,888
I'm a rocket scientist in
the space and defense industry


11
0:0:22,888 --> 0:0:25,724
here in my hometown of
Huntsville, Alabama,


12
0:0:25,724 --> 0:0:27,393
where my daddy helped
build the rockets


13
0:0:27,393 --> 0:0:28,961
that sent us to the moon.


14
0:0:28,961 --> 0:0:31,73
DADDY: Have y'all been drinking
rocket fuel again?


15
0:0:31,73 --> 0:0:34,467
TRAVIS: Sometimes big science
moves too slow for me,


16
0:0:34,467 --> 0:0:37,536
so come the weekend,
I round up my best friend Rog...


17
0:0:37,536 --> 0:0:38,771
ROG: Hey!


18
0:0:38,771 --> 0:0:40,973
TRAVIS: ...my nephew Michael
and my buddy Pete


19
0:0:40,973 --> 0:0:42,441
to tackle important problems


20
0:0:42,441 --> 0:0:45,478
with a little down-home
ingenuity.


21
0:0:45,478 --> 0:0:50,82
ROG: Damn it, boy!


22
0:0:50,82 --> 0:0:51,25
TRAVIS: Right on.


23
0:0:51,25 --> 0:0:56,956
Hey, is there any more beers
in the cooler?


24
0:0:56,956 --> 0:0:57,957
PETE: I got some more cars.


25
0:0:57,957 --> 0:0:58,791
TRAVIS: Alright.


26
0:0:58,791 --> 0:1:0,226
Me and the guys,


27
0:1:0,226 --> 0:1:2,661
we're getting ready to destroy
a giant dollhouse.


28
0:1:2,661 --> 0:1:4,396
ROG: They playing house, man.


29
0:1:4,396 --> 0:1:6,532
MICHAEL:
Three grown men playing house.


30
0:1:6,532 --> 0:1:9,368
I show up and see Uncle Travis
playing with a dollhouse.


31
0:1:9,368 --> 0:1:10,503
I don't know what's
gotten in to him.


32
0:1:10,503 --> 0:1:11,937
ROG: What in the world?


33
0:1:11,937 --> 0:1:13,439
DADDY: I was kind of hoping
y'all wouldn't see this.


34
0:1:13,439 --> 0:1:15,608
ROG: Ain't that the dollhouse
he had when he was a little boy?


35
0:1:15,608 --> 0:1:17,76
TRAVIS: It's the dollhouse
you used to play with.


36
0:1:17,76 --> 0:1:18,11
ROG: Whatever.


37
0:1:18,11 --> 0:1:19,278
TRAVIS: Uh-huh,
I remember going over


38
0:1:19,278 --> 0:1:20,946
and seeing you with that
Ken doll right there.


39
0:1:20,946 --> 0:1:22,47
ROG: Mine was camouflaged.


40
0:1:22,47 --> 0:1:22,915
TRAVIS: Uh-huh.


41
0:1:22,915 --> 0:1:24,483
Now that everybody's here,


42
0:1:24,483 --> 0:1:26,886
Pete and I get to do something
that I've always wanted to do.


43
0:1:26,886 --> 0:1:30,789
Light that thing up and
throw it over in there.


44
0:1:30,789 --> 0:1:35,628
The bomb's about to hit
in three, two, one.


45
0:1:35,628 --> 0:1:37,229
Wow, oh, look at that!


46
0:1:37,229 --> 0:1:38,731
Look at it go!


47
0:1:38,731 --> 0:1:42,234
Man, I think it needs a bigger
fireball than that.


48
0:1:42,234 --> 0:1:44,27
Now that's a fireball!


49
0:1:44,27 --> 0:1:45,804
Now, there are a lot of folks
out there


50
0:1:45,804 --> 0:1:48,7
who call themselves preppers.


51
0:1:48,7 --> 0:1:50,809
They build shelters in their
homes to protect themselves


52
0:1:50,809 --> 0:1:54,513
from stuff like a nuclear war
or an asteroid strike


53
0:1:54,513 --> 0:1:57,16
or a civil war or whatever.


54
0:1:57,16 --> 0:1:58,951
I wanted to demonstrate
what would happen


55
0:1:58,951 --> 0:2:1,453
to the average house during
something like that,


56
0:2:1,453 --> 0:2:3,689
and show why that's not
such a good idea.


57
0:2:3,689 --> 0:2:6,492
This is what's gonna happen if
you're stuck in your shelter


58
0:2:6,492 --> 0:2:8,36
and there's a multiple
thousand degree...


59
0:2:8,36 --> 0:2:11,697
Oh, there goes the structure,
it's collapsed!


60
0:2:11,697 --> 0:2:13,232
If you know that something's
about to happen,


61
0:2:13,232 --> 0:2:15,434
like a missile attack
or something like that,


62
0:2:15,434 --> 0:2:16,802
you don't want to be
stuck in one place,


63
0:2:16,802 --> 0:2:18,771
you want to get as far away
from that as possible...


64
0:2:18,771 --> 0:2:20,272
Woo!


65
0:2:20,272 --> 0:2:22,508
...'cause otherwise you might be
like the doll in the dollhouse


66
0:2:22,508 --> 0:2:23,943
and get dry roasted.


67
0:2:23,943 --> 0:2:25,578
MICHAEL: He's gone now.


68
0:2:25,578 --> 0:2:27,413
ROG: I told Ken to
get out of there.


69
0:2:27,413 --> 0:2:33,485
But he wouldn't listen.


70
0:2:33,485 --> 0:2:36,222
TRAVIS: The answer for surviving
doomsday is simple.


71
0:2:36,222 --> 0:2:37,756
You got to get away from this.


72
0:2:37,756 --> 0:2:40,793
This weekend we're going to
apply our ingenuity


73
0:2:40,793 --> 0:2:42,528
to create an apocalypse shelter


74
0:2:42,528 --> 0:2:45,231
that will survive the most
likely doomsday scenario


75
0:2:45,231 --> 0:2:46,832
here in Huntsville, Alabama,


76
0:2:46,832 --> 0:2:49,668
and that's either a military
or a terrorist attack.


77
0:2:49,668 --> 0:2:51,67
I've heard that
during the Cold War


78
0:2:51,67 --> 0:2:54,39
the Soviets made Huntsville
one of the top cities


79
0:2:54,39 --> 0:2:58,811
for a nuclear attack right after
Washington, DC, and San Diego.


80
0:2:58,811 --> 0:3:1,914
Huntsville is a major hub of
the defense and space industry,


81
0:3:1,914 --> 0:3:4,316
and today a terrorist group
or a rogue state


82
0:3:4,316 --> 0:3:7,786
might also want to hit it
for the same reason.


83
0:3:7,786 --> 0:3:10,789
But most doomsday scenarios have
a lot of the same elements,


84
0:3:10,789 --> 0:3:14,393
whether it's an attack or a
pandemic or an asteroid strike.


85
0:3:14,393 --> 0:3:17,896
If the apocalypse happens,
you want to get out of Dodge,


86
0:3:17,896 --> 0:3:20,966
and that means our survival
plans will have to be mobile.


87
0:3:20,966 --> 0:3:22,34
ROG: Man, stank.


88
0:3:22,34 --> 0:3:23,435
TRAVIS: Woo.


89
0:3:23,435 --> 0:3:26,38
So we went back to the garage
to figure this thing out.


90
0:3:26,38 --> 0:3:27,473
So what do you got to do


91
0:3:27,473 --> 0:3:30,42
if you're gonna be on the move
after the Armageddon?


92
0:3:30,42 --> 0:3:31,21
ROG: Well, the main thing
you need


93
0:3:31,21 --> 0:3:32,611
is food, water and shelter,
right?


94
0:3:32,611 --> 0:3:33,712
TRAVIS: Food, water and shelter.


95
0:3:33,712 --> 0:3:35,281
Well, that's your key
right there.


96
0:3:35,281 --> 0:3:36,515
MICHAEL: If it's the end
of the world,


97
0:3:36,515 --> 0:3:37,95
I don't know what I'd want
to take with me.


98
0:3:37,95 --> 0:3:39,285
You'd probably want to take
a bar of soap,


99
0:3:39,285 --> 0:3:41,954
you'd smell yourself
after a few weeks or something,


100
0:3:41,954 --> 0:3:45,424
but I don't really know what
else would you want to take.


101
0:3:45,424 --> 0:3:47,393
TRAVIS: So it's all
got to be mobile.


102
0:3:47,393 --> 0:3:50,729
In a real apocalypse, you're
gonna have to stay on the move.


103
0:3:50,729 --> 0:3:52,464
And you're gonna have to do it
on foot.


104
0:3:52,464 --> 0:3:55,401
You won't have cars, or
you won't have them very long.


105
0:3:55,401 --> 0:3:57,536
You won't have oil
or a power grid


106
0:3:57,536 --> 0:3:59,838
or any other modern convenience.


107
0:3:59,838 --> 0:4:2,908
So everything you have you'll
have to carry on your back.


108
0:4:2,908 --> 0:4:5,144
And that's why the design
of our shelter


109
0:4:5,144 --> 0:4:7,713
is going to revolve
around backpacks.


110
0:4:7,713 --> 0:4:10,82
The packs will carry
all our gear.


111
0:4:10,82 --> 0:4:11,75
Then we can connect them
together


112
0:4:11,75 --> 0:4:13,452
as supports for the shelter.


113
0:4:13,452 --> 0:4:17,423
We'll add a tent, roof and walls
made out of bulletproof Kevlar,


114
0:4:17,423 --> 0:4:21,894
and we'll have a five-man,
mobile doomsday bunker.


115
0:4:21,894 --> 0:4:24,129
We were thinking about
what kind of backpack


116
0:4:24,129 --> 0:4:26,732
would be strong enough to
withstand Armageddon,


117
0:4:26,732 --> 0:4:30,2
and then Daddy comes rolling out
the perfect material...


118
0:4:30,2 --> 0:4:31,236
DADDY: Look out.


119
0:4:31,236 --> 0:4:33,872
TRAVIS: A waterproof barrel.


120
0:4:33,872 --> 0:4:35,441
DADDY: 27.5 pounds.


121
0:4:35,441 --> 0:4:38,21
ROG: Boy, that's heavy
without nothing in it.


122
0:4:38,21 --> 0:4:42,281
DADDY: Of course, first thing,
we've got a problem.


123
0:4:42,281 --> 0:4:43,248
TRAVIS: What'd you say it was?


124
0:4:43,248 --> 0:4:45,5
DADDY: 27 pounds.


125
0:4:45,5 --> 0:4:46,452
TRAVIS: Even though
they're heavy,


126
0:4:46,452 --> 0:4:49,488
I like these barrels better
than a standard fabric pack.


127
0:4:49,488 --> 0:4:52,458
They're rigid and they'll help
repel incoming gunfire.


128
0:4:52,458 --> 0:4:53,425
And I've got some ideas about


129
0:4:53,425 --> 0:4:55,361
how we can make
the barrels useful


130
0:4:55,361 --> 0:4:57,296
in life after the apocalypse.


131
0:4:57,296 --> 0:4:58,664
TRAVIS: Oh, it ain't that bad,
actually.


132
0:4:58,664 --> 0:4:59,998
MICHAEL: Yeah, but you ain't
got nothing in it.


133
0:4:59,998 --> 0:5:1,166
PETE: Yeah.


134
0:5:1,166 --> 0:5:2,501
DADDY: Once we get those barrels
loaded up


135
0:5:2,501 --> 0:5:3,969
with everything we need,


136
0:5:3,969 --> 0:5:6,605
not one of us is gonna be able
to lift them off the floor.


137
0:5:6,605 --> 0:5:8,34
TRAVIS: You three start working.


138
0:5:8,34 --> 0:5:10,42
Me and Pete are gonna start
thinking about


139
0:5:10,42 --> 0:5:11,577
how we're gonna build a tent.


140
0:5:11,577 --> 0:5:15,914
ROG: Yeah, Michael and I are
headed outside to get to work.


141
0:5:15,914 --> 0:5:18,684
How many beers we gonna
take with us?


142
0:5:18,684 --> 0:5:20,819
MICHAEL: I would say a couple
a piece anyhow.


143
0:5:20,819 --> 0:5:23,222
ROG: A couple a piece?
I hear ya.


144
0:5:23,222 --> 0:5:24,823
MICHAEL: Me and Rog are sitting
on side of the garage,


145
0:5:24,823 --> 0:5:26,625
and we got to talking about
what we were gonna do


146
0:5:26,625 --> 0:5:31,23
at the end of the world
if we run out of beer.


147
0:5:31,23 --> 0:5:33,198
I don't think you could tote
enough beer in your pack


148
0:5:33,198 --> 0:5:35,0
to get you very long.


149
0:5:35,0 --> 0:5:38,3
Probably SOL.


150
0:5:38,3 --> 0:5:40,239
That's sad.


151
0:5:40,239 --> 0:5:41,407
TRAVIS: Spread it out
and see what we got.


152
0:5:41,407 --> 0:5:43,742
Pete and I are unrolling
the bulletproof Kevlar


153
0:5:43,742 --> 0:5:47,312
we're gonna use to make the top
and walls of the shelter.


154
0:5:47,312 --> 0:5:50,15
We've got to lay down on it
to see how much we need to use.


155
0:5:50,15 --> 0:5:51,316
Yeah, see,
that's plenty of room.


156
0:5:51,316 --> 0:5:52,451
PETE: Oh, yeah.


157
0:5:52,451 --> 0:5:54,286
TRAVIS: Alright, so we need
twice this.


158
0:5:54,286 --> 0:5:56,355
Then Rog comes in and sees us.


159
0:5:56,355 --> 0:5:57,723
ROG: Y'all gonna leg wrestle,
hold on,


160
0:5:57,723 --> 0:5:59,992
y'all stay down there
and leg wrestle one time.


161
0:5:59,992 --> 0:6:1,26
TRAVIS: You get down there
and leg wrestle with him.


162
0:6:1,26 --> 0:6:3,195
ROG: I ain't gonna do it
with Pete.


163
0:6:3,195 --> 0:6:4,496
I'm not going to
mess around with Pete.


164
0:6:4,496 --> 0:6:6,832
He's got that black belt
in aikido.


165
0:6:6,832 --> 0:6:8,434
But I think I can take Travis.


166
0:6:8,434 --> 0:6:9,368
Let's do it.


167
0:6:9,368 --> 0:6:10,436
TRAVIS: Come on.


168
0:6:10,436 --> 0:6:12,37
ROG: Phew, man,
hold them glasses.


169
0:6:12,37 --> 0:6:13,672
MICHAEL: Alright, I'm gonna
hold his glasses.


170
0:6:13,672 --> 0:6:15,4
TRAVIS: Damn,
this floor is hard.


171
0:6:15,4 --> 0:6:16,275
TRAVIS: You ready?
ROG: Yeah.


172
0:6:16,275 --> 0:6:17,843
TRAVIS: One...
ROG: One...


173
0:6:17,843 --> 0:6:19,11
TRAVIS: You can't even get
your leg up there.


174
0:6:19,11 --> 0:6:20,612
TRAVIS: Two...
ROG: Two...


175
0:6:20,612 --> 0:6:21,847
ROG: Three.
TRAVIS: Three.


176
0:6:21,847 --> 0:6:25,417
TRAVIS: Oh! Rog, you put
your ass into it.


177
0:6:25,417 --> 0:6:26,618
ROG: That's how you do it, man.


178
0:6:26,618 --> 0:6:29,121
TRAVIS: Rog is the champion
leg wrestler.


179
0:6:29,121 --> 0:6:31,256
ROG: Well, I guess now we know
if there's any leg wrestling


180
0:6:31,256 --> 0:6:34,726
that needs to be done after
the apocalypse, I'm the guy.


181
0:6:34,726 --> 0:6:35,694
TRAVIS: You whooped me.


182
0:6:35,694 --> 0:6:37,93
Actually,
a post-apocalyptic world


183
0:6:37,93 --> 0:6:39,998
is probably gonna be
pretty dangerous.


184
0:6:39,998 --> 0:6:41,533
If a missile hits Huntsville,


185
0:6:41,533 --> 0:6:44,603
we might have terrorists or
foreign troops coming in,


186
0:6:44,603 --> 0:6:47,639
or we could have roaming bands
of marauders coming after us,


187
0:6:47,639 --> 0:6:51,109
so I put our resident
optical sensor expert in charge


188
0:6:51,109 --> 0:6:53,178
of creating a simple
early warning system.


189
0:6:53,178 --> 0:6:56,648
That will let us know if
our camp is ever infiltrated.


190
0:6:56,648 --> 0:6:58,851
Alright, Pete, show me what
you got going on in here.


191
0:6:58,851 --> 0:7:3,856
PETE: Okay, this is our
garage door opener/sentry post.


192
0:7:3,856 --> 0:7:5,791
MICHAEL: Pete came up with this
really cool defense system


193
0:7:5,791 --> 0:7:7,926
using lasers to set up
a perimeter.


194
0:7:7,926 --> 0:7:10,863
PETE: There's gonna be three
sensor posts like right here.


195
0:7:10,863 --> 0:7:12,264
Our camp will be in the middle.


196
0:7:12,264 --> 0:7:13,866
This laser shoots over
to this guy,


197
0:7:13,866 --> 0:7:15,734
this laser shoots
over to this guy,


198
0:7:15,734 --> 0:7:17,503
and this receiver picks up
that laser beam.


199
0:7:17,503 --> 0:7:18,837
Just like a garage door opener,


200
0:7:18,837 --> 0:7:20,873
but using a laser will give us
a lot longer distance.


201
0:7:20,873 --> 0:7:21,84
TRAVIS: Right, right.


202
0:7:21,84 --> 0:7:23,342
MICHAEL: And if somebody
crosses it


203
0:7:23,342 --> 0:7:26,178
or breaks the plane of the
laser, a siren's gonna go off.


204
0:7:26,178 --> 0:7:30,115
PETE: And we've got just a small
five-watt solar panel.


205
0:7:30,115 --> 0:7:32,584
So that'll charge up
the batteries.


206
0:7:32,584 --> 0:7:34,19
The great thing
about this system


207
0:7:34,19 --> 0:7:36,188
is that it uses a bunch of
inexpensive stuff


208
0:7:36,188 --> 0:7:38,257
you can buy at
any hardware store.


209
0:7:38,257 --> 0:7:40,459
So you won't need
a generator or gas.


210
0:7:40,459 --> 0:7:44,229
It's off the shelf,
and it's off the grid.


211
0:7:44,229 --> 0:7:47,32
TRAVIS: Now I'm having Michael
weld together some square frames


212
0:7:47,32 --> 0:7:49,268
that will attach to the barrels.


213
0:7:49,268 --> 0:7:51,103
MICHAEL: That's the first
finished product.


214
0:7:51,103 --> 0:7:52,304
TRAVIS: It goes right there,


215
0:7:52,304 --> 0:7:53,839
and then we'll ratchet strap it
here, right?


216
0:7:53,839 --> 0:7:54,907
MICHAEL: Yeah.


217
0:7:54,907 --> 0:7:56,375
TRAVIS: Just go around
and hold it.


218
0:7:56,375 --> 0:7:59,278
Then we'll put a pack right
here, like that right there,


219
0:7:59,278 --> 0:8:0,879
and that's how we'll carry it.


220
0:8:0,879 --> 0:8:3,115
PETE: Once we got that frame
attached to the barrel,


221
0:8:3,115 --> 0:8:5,183
it was my job to give it
a test run.


222
0:8:5,183 --> 0:8:8,186
Seeing what happens
just standing up there.


223
0:8:8,186 --> 0:8:11,256
ROG: Stay with it, man.


224
0:8:11,256 --> 0:8:13,292
TRAVIS: You look like
you're walking around okay.


225
0:8:13,292 --> 0:8:16,361
Go get him a shotgun with
birdshot in it, Daddy.


226
0:8:16,361 --> 0:8:17,563
DADDY: What are you gonna do
with birdshot?


227
0:8:17,563 --> 0:8:18,53
TRAVIS: See if he can
shoot a gun


228
0:8:18,53 --> 0:8:20,599
while he's holding that thing.


229
0:8:20,599 --> 0:8:23,936
After any apocalyptic situation,
if things go bad,


230
0:8:23,936 --> 0:8:26,872
you can bet that the bad guys
are going to be heavily armed.


231
0:8:26,872 --> 0:8:29,541
So we're gonna have to be
heavily armed, too.


232
0:8:29,541 --> 0:8:31,9
ROG: Stay with it, Pete.


233
0:8:31,9 --> 0:8:35,581
TRAVIS: I'm gonna stand behind
you in case you fall back.


234
0:8:35,581 --> 0:8:37,482
We set up a target
using that Kevlar


235
0:8:37,482 --> 0:8:38,984
that we're gonna use
to make the shelter,


236
0:8:38,984 --> 0:8:45,357
'cause we wanted to see how
bulletproof it really is.


237
0:8:45,357 --> 0:8:46,592
He didn't fall.


238
0:8:46,592 --> 0:8:49,328
Both Pete and that Kevlar
held up pretty good.


239
0:8:49,328 --> 0:8:51,296
[gunshot]


240
0:8:51,296 --> 0:8:56,568
So it looks like we're ready
to go ahead with our plans.


241
0:8:56,568 --> 0:8:59,871
First thing, we got to make
four more of those backpacks.


242
0:8:59,871 --> 0:9:1,39
MICHAEL: Alright, there's that


243
0:9:1,39 --> 0:9:3,442
and I need one more
ratchet strap now.


244
0:9:3,442 --> 0:9:5,344
ROG: It's the end of the world,
man, we need everything.


245
0:9:5,344 --> 0:9:7,813
MICHAEL: Alright, here's one
that goes right here.


246
0:9:7,813 --> 0:9:9,648
TRAVIS: Next we'll connect them
all together


247
0:9:9,648 --> 0:9:11,116
to make the base of the shelter.


248
0:9:11,116 --> 0:9:12,651
ROG: There's the A,
where's the A at?


249
0:9:12,651 --> 0:9:14,653
MICHAEL: I got an A mark
and a G mark.


250
0:9:14,653 --> 0:9:16,922
There's so many pieces that
make up the frame,


251
0:9:16,922 --> 0:9:18,357
we labeled them alphabetically


252
0:9:18,357 --> 0:9:19,858
so we can keep them
all straight.


253
0:9:19,858 --> 0:9:22,794
DADDY: There's  an A, a G, a D,
and me, and the chimpanzee.


254
0:9:22,794 --> 0:9:23,929
TRAVIS: Chimpanzee, agree,


255
0:9:23,929 --> 0:9:26,999
one day soon he'll be
a celebri-tee.


256
0:9:26,999 --> 0:9:28,433
ROG: I got a C.


257
0:9:28,433 --> 0:9:30,102
DADDY: Okay, wait a minute,
you've got it right here.


258
0:9:30,102 --> 0:9:32,471
ROG: Where's D?
DADDY: There you go.


259
0:9:32,471 --> 0:9:35,507
ROG: We got this crazy,
complicated contraption.


260
0:9:35,507 --> 0:9:37,476
And you can't find
all the pieces,


261
0:9:37,476 --> 0:9:39,578
the frame's labeled
up to the letter Q,


262
0:9:39,578 --> 0:9:43,48
and we're supposed to put this
together during the Armageddon?


263
0:9:43,48 --> 0:9:45,117
We can't even put it together
in the garage.


264
0:9:45,117 --> 0:9:47,519
TRAVIS: I'm confused, man.


265
0:9:47,519 --> 0:9:49,21
MICHAEL: I want to make things
a little simpler


266
0:9:49,21 --> 0:9:52,124
by making a color code
instead of just letters.


267
0:9:52,124 --> 0:9:54,192
Now, I can make this one
yellow with a dot.


268
0:9:54,192 --> 0:9:57,562
But I think that might have made
things even more confusing.


269
0:9:57,562 --> 0:9:59,164
That'll be the green one
right there.


270
0:9:59,164 --> 0:10:0,265
ROG: Look at that boy going.


271
0:10:0,265 --> 0:10:2,768
You ought to be a tagger
for a living, man.


272
0:10:2,768 --> 0:10:4,703
This is gonna be the prettiest
y'all ever seen.


273
0:10:4,703 --> 0:10:8,473
TRAVIS: Yeah, but how are
we gonna make the tent now?


274
0:10:8,473 --> 0:10:10,275
[horn honks]


275
0:10:10,275 --> 0:10:12,344
What's Sloth doing here?


276
0:10:12,344 --> 0:10:14,646
ROG: My neighbor Sloth is
one of them doomsday preppers.


277
0:10:14,646 --> 0:10:15,781
So when I told him


278
0:10:15,781 --> 0:10:18,15
we were making a mobile
apocalypse shelter,


279
0:10:18,15 --> 0:10:20,752
he said he'd bring some of his
buddies over to check it out.


280
0:10:20,752 --> 0:10:21,82
TRAVIS: I can't see
none of them,


281
0:10:21,82 --> 0:10:23,255
they're all wearing camouflage.


282
0:10:23,255 --> 0:10:25,23
SLOTH: Well, Rog told me
y'all been prepping


283
0:10:25,23 --> 0:10:26,692
some kind of portable shelter.


284
0:10:26,692 --> 0:10:29,94
And, you know, I've been doing
a little prepping, too.


285
0:10:29,94 --> 0:10:30,62
TRAVIS: Yeah?


286
0:10:30,62 --> 0:10:31,663
If I didn't know better,


287
0:10:31,663 --> 0:10:34,566
I'd say that Sloth thinks
that him and his buddies


288
0:10:34,566 --> 0:10:36,968
are better prepared for doomsday
than we are.


289
0:10:36,968 --> 0:10:38,203
Is that a challenge?


290
0:10:38,203 --> 0:10:39,438
SLOTH: If y'all are gonna be out
running around


291
0:10:39,438 --> 0:10:41,94
traipsing about
through the woods,


292
0:10:41,94 --> 0:10:44,342
we're gonna come hunt y'all down
and take your stuff from you.


293
0:10:44,342 --> 0:10:50,982
TRAVIS: Oh, you think so?
SLOTH: Oh, I know so.


294
0:10:50,982 --> 0:10:52,918
DADDY: W...or is than an M?


295
0:10:52,918 --> 0:10:54,92
TRAVIS: We're building
a doomsday shelter.


296
0:10:54,92 --> 0:10:57,689
MICHAEL: That's a B.
Is that A over there?


297
0:10:57,689 --> 0:10:59,991
TRAVIS: But since I think the
best way to survive Armageddon


298
0:10:59,991 --> 0:11:1,493
is to get away from it,


299
0:11:1,493 --> 0:11:3,528
we're making our shelter mobile.


300
0:11:3,528 --> 0:11:5,263
DADDY: There you go.


301
0:11:5,263 --> 0:11:7,199
TRAVIS: When our buddy Sloth
found out about it,


302
0:11:7,199 --> 0:11:10,669
he stopped by and challenged us
to a doomsday duel.


303
0:11:10,669 --> 0:11:11,937
SLOTH: If y'all gonna be out
running around


304
0:11:11,937 --> 0:11:14,506
traipsing about
through the woods,


305
0:11:14,506 --> 0:11:16,842
we're gonna come hunt y'all down
and take your stuff from you.


306
0:11:16,842 --> 0:11:18,81
TRAVIS: Oh, you think so?
SLOTH: Oh, I know so.


307
0:11:18,81 --> 0:11:20,312
SLOTH: Look at this team, man,
are you kidding me?


308
0:11:20,312 --> 0:11:21,446
TRAVIS: If he gets too close,


309
0:11:21,446 --> 0:11:23,381
we'll have to leg wrestle him,
Rog.


310
0:11:23,381 --> 0:11:24,816
You know you'll whoop him then.


311
0:11:24,816 --> 0:11:27,52
SLOTH: Since we can't use
real guns,


312
0:11:27,52 --> 0:11:30,355
I figure we'd go with this--
paintballs.


313
0:11:30,355 --> 0:11:33,258
TRAVIS: Looks like we got
a doomsday showdown here.


314
0:11:33,258 --> 0:11:35,761
Team Sloth versus Team Travis.


315
0:11:35,761 --> 0:11:37,129
We got an air horn up in there.


316
0:11:37,129 --> 0:11:38,296
SLOTH: Alright.


317
0:11:38,296 --> 0:11:39,431
TRAVIS: Y'all go on down
about a mile or so


318
0:11:39,431 --> 0:11:40,265
down back past the church
or something.


319
0:11:40,265 --> 0:11:41,399
SLOTH: Okay.


320
0:11:41,399 --> 0:11:42,601
TRAVIS: And when you hear
the air horn,


321
0:11:42,601 --> 0:11:43,602
we'll say that's
the end of the world.


322
0:11:43,602 --> 0:11:44,836
SLOTH: Alright.


323
0:11:44,836 --> 0:11:46,104
TRAVIS: And then, everybody,
it's go time.


324
0:11:46,104 --> 0:11:48,64
This competition might seem
like a lot of fun,


325
0:11:48,64 --> 0:11:50,976
but in an actual
doomsday scenario,


326
0:11:50,976 --> 0:11:53,612
mobs and bandits could be
a serious problem.


327
0:11:53,612 --> 0:11:55,13
So tomorrow morning


328
0:11:55,13 --> 0:11:58,216
we're gonna put our apocalypse
shelter to the test.


329
0:11:58,216 --> 0:12:0,519
Not only are we gonna take it
out into the woods,


330
0:12:0,519 --> 0:12:2,454
and deploy it,
and see if it works,


331
0:12:2,454 --> 0:12:4,322
we're gonna do it
while being hunted


332
0:12:4,322 --> 0:12:7,526
by Mad Max-style marauders.


333
0:12:7,526 --> 0:12:10,128
DADDY: Paint "loser" on
the side of that truck.


334
0:12:10,128 --> 0:12:12,998
TRAVIS: There you go, Daddy,
that's the spirit.


335
0:12:12,998 --> 0:12:16,134
The only problem is we haven't
even finished our shelter yet,


336
0:12:16,134 --> 0:12:18,103
and we don't even know how
we're gonna make the tent.


337
0:12:18,103 --> 0:12:20,705
Oh, no, no, no, we got extra--
we do an A with the poles.


338
0:12:20,705 --> 0:12:22,774
Then Rog had a brainstorm.


339
0:12:22,774 --> 0:12:24,643
ROG: Hey, we got them things.


340
0:12:24,643 --> 0:12:27,612
Let's tape them together and
make a covered wagon-hickey.


341
0:12:27,612 --> 0:12:29,114
TRAVIS: So hand me some of that.


342
0:12:29,114 --> 0:12:30,515
DADDY: I've got those
fiberglass rods


343
0:12:30,515 --> 0:12:32,317
I used to make
bow and arrows with.


344
0:12:32,317 --> 0:12:34,553
They're really strong,
but they're flexible.


345
0:12:34,553 --> 0:12:37,155
So we're gonna take a few of
those and connect them together,


346
0:12:37,155 --> 0:12:39,991
and they'll be the frame
for our tent.


347
0:12:39,991 --> 0:12:42,828
TRAVIS: Now if we have another
one right there...


348
0:12:42,828 --> 0:12:44,229
DADDY: We Velcroed them
into place,


349
0:12:44,229 --> 0:12:48,66
and they formed the perfect dome
to stretch that Kevlar over.


350
0:12:48,66 --> 0:12:49,534
ROG: Stay with it.


351
0:12:49,534 --> 0:12:51,603
TRAVIS: All the way, so you can
shove it up under the barrel.


352
0:12:51,603 --> 0:12:52,771
MICHAEL: There you go.


353
0:12:52,771 --> 0:12:55,73
TRAVIS: There it is,
there's your tent.


354
0:12:55,73 --> 0:12:58,76
This whole thing took a lot
longer than we thought it would.


355
0:12:58,76 --> 0:13:1,446
It was dark by the time
we had that frame all together.


356
0:13:1,446 --> 0:13:4,82
And now we've got to work
into the night


357
0:13:4,82 --> 0:13:6,718
to put together our bug-out bags
and have everything in it


358
0:13:6,718 --> 0:13:9,688
we need for the end
of civilization.


359
0:13:9,688 --> 0:13:12,958
Doomsday is tomorrow.


360
0:13:12,958 --> 0:13:14,459
Let's load it up.


361
0:13:14,459 --> 0:13:18,83
Let's figure out what we got to
do to get it all in the packs.


362
0:13:18,83 --> 0:13:20,866
I want to make this
a real world test.


363
0:13:20,866 --> 0:13:23,735
We're focusing on a single
doomsday scenario--


364
0:13:23,735 --> 0:13:26,504
a missile or bomb attack
on Huntsville.


365
0:13:26,504 --> 0:13:28,44
It's big enough to
knock out the grid


366
0:13:28,44 --> 0:13:31,9
and call for an evacuation
of the city,


367
0:13:31,9 --> 0:13:34,613
a disaster the size of
Hurricane Katrina or bigger.


368
0:13:34,613 --> 0:13:36,615
It'll be chaos!


369
0:13:36,615 --> 0:13:40,518
Experts say that looting and
mob behavior can begin quickly


370
0:13:40,518 --> 0:13:43,755
when the grid goes down
and police are unavailable.


371
0:13:43,755 --> 0:13:46,925
So hoards of bandits
like Sloth's boys


372
0:13:46,925 --> 0:13:49,628
could actually be targeting
people who are already prepared.


373
0:13:49,628 --> 0:13:50,929
SLOTH: We're gonna get
geared up,


374
0:13:50,929 --> 0:13:53,298
and then we'll a do check
on these paintball guns.


375
0:13:53,298 --> 0:13:55,333
TRAVIS: But the guys and I
have added a little twist


376
0:13:55,333 --> 0:13:57,68
to our doomsday shelter


377
0:13:57,68 --> 0:14:0,639
that I think is gonna give them
marauders a real surprise.


378
0:14:0,639 --> 0:14:3,174
SLOTH: They're probably gonna be
headed up toward the river.


379
0:14:3,174 --> 0:14:4,509
So what we'll do is
we'll get geared up,


380
0:14:4,509 --> 0:14:5,911
and we'll just start
heading north,


381
0:14:5,911 --> 0:14:8,213
and as soon as we hear that
buzzer Travis was talking about,


382
0:14:8,213 --> 0:14:12,25
we'll go hunt them down
and get them.


383
0:14:12,25 --> 0:14:14,152
TRAVIS: It's zero hour.


384
0:14:14,152 --> 0:14:16,54
The apocalypse is
about to begin.


385
0:14:16,54 --> 0:14:17,822
Imagine that
the missiles have fallen


386
0:14:17,822 --> 0:14:19,391
or the asteroid has struck.


387
0:14:19,391 --> 0:14:22,93
The grid is down,
so there's no electricity,


388
0:14:22,93 --> 0:14:25,563
and once there's no electricity,
things fall apart quick.


389
0:14:25,563 --> 0:14:28,333
You can't buy gas because
the pumps won't work.


390
0:14:28,333 --> 0:14:31,136
You can't drive because
the highways are jammed.


391
0:14:31,136 --> 0:14:33,71
You can't use an ATM.


392
0:14:33,71 --> 0:14:36,107
The phone lines and cell towers
are down.


393
0:14:36,107 --> 0:14:38,677
Crowds of panicked people
are trying to flee,


394
0:14:38,677 --> 0:14:40,378
and other crowds are looting.


395
0:14:40,378 --> 0:14:41,513
The cities are burning,


396
0:14:41,513 --> 0:14:44,215
and the marauding hordes
are on the rampage.


397
0:14:44,215 --> 0:14:48,386
It's time to bug out,
rocket city style.


398
0:14:48,386 --> 0:14:49,688
Here we go, end of the world.


399
0:14:49,688 --> 0:14:52,624
[horn blares]


400
0:14:52,624 --> 0:14:58,229
SLOTH: Uh-oh.
We got to hurry up.


401
0:14:58,229 --> 0:15:0,332
MAN: They work.
We're good to go.


402
0:15:0,332 --> 0:15:4,703
SLOTH: Alright,
let's go get 'em.


403
0:15:4,703 --> 0:15:6,905
TRAVIS: We're carrying food
and water for three days--


404
0:15:6,905 --> 0:15:9,441
enough to get us to another
supply source.


405
0:15:9,441 --> 0:15:10,608
We've got our weapons...


406
0:15:10,608 --> 0:15:11,81
DADDY:
Is the gun already loaded?


407
0:15:11,81 --> 0:15:14,512
TRAVIS: My gun's full of ammo.


408
0:15:14,512 --> 0:15:15,981
...and some power tools.


409
0:15:15,981 --> 0:15:19,5
Best of all, we've got
our mobile shelter.


410
0:15:19,5 --> 0:15:19,951
PETE: Let's head towards
the tree,


411
0:15:19,951 --> 0:15:20,819
at least there's some cover.


412
0:15:20,819 --> 0:15:22,2
TRAVIS: Everybody be ready,


413
0:15:22,2 --> 0:15:24,89
they could be in this
tall grass somewhere.


414
0:15:24,89 --> 0:15:25,39
ROG: Here's a cow trail.


415
0:15:25,39 --> 0:15:26,758
MICHAEL: Hey, where's the cow?


416
0:15:26,758 --> 0:15:28,293
If this is the end of the world,
we could...


417
0:15:28,293 --> 0:15:29,961
TRAVIS: We could eat cows.


418
0:15:29,961 --> 0:15:31,496
PETE: We could blind it
with a paintball gun


419
0:15:31,496 --> 0:15:33,31
and then wrestle it
to the ground.


420
0:15:33,31 --> 0:15:33,965
MICHAEL: Yeah.
TRAVIS: Yeah.


421
0:15:33,965 --> 0:15:35,533
[laughter]


422
0:15:35,533 --> 0:15:36,801
DADDY: There's a place
right through here we can camp.


423
0:15:36,801 --> 0:15:38,503
TRAVIS: I don't think
there's anybody


424
0:15:38,503 --> 0:15:40,372
who knows these woods
better than Daddy.


425
0:15:40,372 --> 0:15:42,807
So he found us a good spot
to set up.


426
0:15:42,807 --> 0:15:44,109
DADDY: You'll have to walk
around this limb.


427
0:15:44,109 --> 0:15:46,845
That's kind of part of the plan.


428
0:15:46,845 --> 0:15:49,647
In major disasters,
you don't want to be in a city.


429
0:15:49,647 --> 0:15:53,18
Sometimes the worst thing
you can face is other people.


430
0:15:53,18 --> 0:15:54,319
I'm a country boy.


431
0:15:54,319 --> 0:15:55,653
When things go bad,


432
0:15:55,653 --> 0:15:58,39
the safest place to be
is out in these woods.


433
0:15:58,39 --> 0:15:59,391
Right over here, guys.


434
0:15:59,391 --> 0:16:0,759
TRAVIS: Good-looking spot,
Daddy.


435
0:16:0,759 --> 0:16:3,628
DADDY: We chose this place
for its tactical advantages.


436
0:16:3,628 --> 0:16:7,665
We could see the road, but the
folks on the road can't see us.


437
0:16:7,665 --> 0:16:9,701
MICHAEL: Let's come out
of these packs.


438
0:16:9,701 --> 0:16:12,437
DADDY: We got a good field
of vision on all sides,


439
0:16:12,437 --> 0:16:14,239
and we got tree cover up above.


440
0:16:14,239 --> 0:16:16,875
It's a good, safe spot for
a defensive position.


441
0:16:16,875 --> 0:16:18,243
If they approach,


442
0:16:18,243 --> 0:16:19,711
they're gonna have to come
out of the southwest.


443
0:16:19,711 --> 0:16:24,849
PETE: So that's where we got
to set up our sensor system.


444
0:16:24,849 --> 0:16:27,352
DADDY: Come here and help us
figure this thing out.


445
0:16:27,352 --> 0:16:29,54
MICHAEL: There's G.


446
0:16:29,54 --> 0:16:30,989
Where's D? Is this D?


447
0:16:30,989 --> 0:16:31,89
ROG: That's E.


448
0:16:31,89 --> 0:16:33,158
MICHAEL: E, oh, D's up there.


449
0:16:33,158 --> 0:16:36,494
ROG: Hey, you got a C
over there?


450
0:16:36,494 --> 0:16:38,43
You got any threes?


451
0:16:38,43 --> 0:16:39,397
MICHAEL: Go fish.


452
0:16:39,397 --> 0:16:42,2
ROG: Oh, go fish, dang.


453
0:16:42,2 --> 0:16:46,337
TRAVIS: Daddy, catch that end.


454
0:16:46,337 --> 0:16:48,306
MICHAEL: We got the Kevlar sheet
stretched tight


455
0:16:48,306 --> 0:16:49,874
and pegged down at the base.


456
0:16:49,874 --> 0:16:52,877
With a little practice, we could
set this thing up pretty fast.


457
0:16:52,877 --> 0:16:54,813
TRAVIS: It looks kind of like
an igloo or something.


458
0:16:54,813 --> 0:16:55,88
PETE: It does.


459
0:16:55,88 --> 0:16:57,282
TRAVIS:
That's a lot of hard work.


460
0:16:57,282 --> 0:16:58,349
I think we ought to
eat something.


461
0:16:58,349 --> 0:17:0,285
I'll get the MREs out.


462
0:17:0,285 --> 0:17:2,654
ROG: I saw that Travis
had packed some MREs.


463
0:17:2,654 --> 0:17:6,57
I thought I'd bring something
a little bit tastier.


464
0:17:6,57 --> 0:17:7,759
PETE: Oh, heck, yes.
DADDY: Oh, man.


465
0:17:7,759 --> 0:17:9,561
TRAVIS: You been carrying that
all day long?


466
0:17:9,561 --> 0:17:10,795
ROG: Yeah.


467
0:17:10,795 --> 0:17:13,431
TRAVIS: It ain't bad.
Give me one of them.


468
0:17:13,431 --> 0:17:14,999
Rog?


469
0:17:14,999 --> 0:17:16,434
ROG: It's the end of the world,
man.


470
0:17:16,434 --> 0:17:19,7
TRAVIS: Yeah, it's the last
pizza you'll ever get.


471
0:17:19,7 --> 0:17:21,172
PETE: Oh, that ain't no good.
Man.


472
0:17:21,172 --> 0:17:22,6
[alarm sounds]


473
0:17:22,6 --> 0:17:24,275
MICHAEL: Oh, hold on, get down.


474
0:17:24,275 --> 0:17:26,678
TRAVIS: Sloth's marauders
hit us.


475
0:17:26,678 --> 0:17:27,946
Take cover.


476
0:17:27,946 --> 0:17:30,215
But our early warning system
gave us the time


477
0:17:30,215 --> 0:17:32,35
to get into our
bulletproof shelter.


478
0:17:32,35 --> 0:17:35,453
Still, the best defense is
always a good offense.


479
0:17:35,453 --> 0:17:37,188
So we took the fight
to the enemy.


480
0:17:37,188 --> 0:17:38,356
Let's go get 'em.


481
0:17:38,356 --> 0:17:39,791
MICHAEL: Let's do it,
let's do it.


482
0:17:39,791 --> 0:17:41,426
TRAVIS: Spread out, everybody
spread out and take some trees.


483
0:17:41,426 --> 0:17:43,428
Oh! Oh, oh, oh!


484
0:17:43,428 --> 0:17:49,501
Then Daddy was down.


485
0:17:49,501 --> 0:17:51,536
[alarm sounds]
MICHAEL: Hold on, get down!


486
0:17:51,536 --> 0:17:53,571
TRAVIS: We built a portable
doomsday shelter


487
0:17:53,571 --> 0:17:55,6
that we're defending from Sloth


488
0:17:55,6 --> 0:17:58,61
and his group of
marauding bandits.


489
0:17:58,61 --> 0:18:1,913
Oh, shoot, that come
right by my head!


490
0:18:1,913 --> 0:18:4,382
But just when it looked like
we're getting the upper hand...


491
0:18:4,382 --> 0:18:5,85
Everybody spread out
and take some trees.


492
0:18:5,85 --> 0:18:8,586
Oh! Oh, oh, oh!


493
0:18:8,586 --> 0:18:11,523
I saw Daddy hit the ground.


494
0:18:11,523 --> 0:18:12,657
MICHAEL: You alright, Papa?


495
0:18:12,657 --> 0:18:14,259
DADDY: He got my head.
[laughs]


496
0:18:14,259 --> 0:18:15,627
PETE: You okay?


497
0:18:15,627 --> 0:18:17,595
DADDY: I mean, it cut right
across the top of my head


498
0:18:17,595 --> 0:18:19,597
and knocked my hat off.


499
0:18:19,597 --> 0:18:21,432
TRAVIS: Stay low, Daddy.


500
0:18:21,432 --> 0:18:23,1
DADDY: That was a close one.


501
0:18:23,1 --> 0:18:25,97
They just knocked my hat off,
so I'm still in the game.


502
0:18:25,97 --> 0:18:28,973
I'm fine, keep going.


503
0:18:28,973 --> 0:18:31,643
TRAVIS: We could have stayed
safe inside the Kevlar igloo...


504
0:18:31,643 --> 0:18:34,112
Alright, let's go get 'em.


505
0:18:34,112 --> 0:18:39,25
...but we weren't about to let
those marauders surround us.


506
0:18:39,25 --> 0:18:43,288
Go, go, press advantage.


507
0:18:43,288 --> 0:18:46,824
PETE: Go!


508
0:18:46,824 --> 0:18:51,229
SLOTH: Guys, retreat, retreat!


509
0:18:51,229 --> 0:18:53,97
PETE: Is everybody good?
Everybody okay?


510
0:18:53,97 --> 0:18:54,666
ROG: Shoot, man.


511
0:18:54,666 --> 0:18:56,0
TRAVIS: I think they left.


512
0:18:56,0 --> 0:18:57,969
The alarm system worked good,
man.


513
0:18:57,969 --> 0:19:0,338
We'd have been in trouble
had it not gone off.


514
0:19:0,338 --> 0:19:1,739
SLOTH: I thought they were
gonna be sitting ducks,


515
0:19:1,739 --> 0:19:3,908
and we were gonna just walk in
and take their stuff.


516
0:19:3,908 --> 0:19:7,378
And then that alarm went off,
and we were in a firefight.


517
0:19:7,378 --> 0:19:8,746
We'll be back, though.


518
0:19:8,746 --> 0:19:9,948
TRAVIS: Let's get this thing
loaded up,


519
0:19:9,948 --> 0:19:10,915
and let's get down to the river
and get away


520
0:19:10,915 --> 0:19:12,817
so they can't ambush us again.


521
0:19:12,817 --> 0:19:15,386
We've proven that our
shelter concept works.


522
0:19:15,386 --> 0:19:16,854
But I know they're coming back,


523
0:19:16,854 --> 0:19:20,191
and that's why we made
this thing mobile.


524
0:19:20,191 --> 0:19:21,726
When civilization collapses,


525
0:19:21,726 --> 0:19:23,661
you're going to want to
be able to move.


526
0:19:23,661 --> 0:19:25,263
In the Balkan War in the '90s,


527
0:19:25,263 --> 0:19:27,899
people survived by fleeing
the cities to the woods


528
0:19:27,899 --> 0:19:30,34
and keeping ahead of
the bad guys.


529
0:19:30,34 --> 0:19:35,6
So we're gonna tear this thing
down and get back on the move.


530
0:19:35,6 --> 0:19:37,8
We got to get going.


531
0:19:37,8 --> 0:19:39,811
Putting the bolts in this jar
right here.


532
0:19:39,811 --> 0:19:42,614
Since we need to get out of here
as fast as we can,


533
0:19:42,614 --> 0:19:43,982
we're leaving the main part
of the frame


534
0:19:43,982 --> 0:19:49,254
still connected together.


535
0:19:49,254 --> 0:19:50,555
ROG: Crap.


536
0:19:50,555 --> 0:19:52,624
MICHAEL: You all right?
ROG: Yeah, I'm all right.


537
0:19:52,624 --> 0:19:53,691
TRAVIS: Let's go.


538
0:19:53,691 --> 0:19:54,826
None of us are real happy


539
0:19:54,826 --> 0:19:57,28
about putting these backpacks
on again.


540
0:19:57,28 --> 0:19:59,63
I'm checking my luggage
next time.


541
0:19:59,63 --> 0:20:2,3
But we're carrying part
of the frame by hand.


542
0:20:2,3 --> 0:20:3,601
Alright, here we are.


543
0:20:3,601 --> 0:20:6,37
Because we're gonna deploy
our secret weapon


544
0:20:6,37 --> 0:20:7,405
once we're at the river.


545
0:20:7,405 --> 0:20:8,873
PETE: Alright, guys, it's clear.


546
0:20:8,873 --> 0:20:11,643
TRAVIS: These backpacks don't
just turn into a shelter,


547
0:20:11,643 --> 0:20:15,446
they also turn into a boat.


548
0:20:15,446 --> 0:20:16,948
DADDY: When I saw those barrels,


549
0:20:16,948 --> 0:20:19,817
I thought,
those things can float.


550
0:20:19,817 --> 0:20:22,42
MICHAEL: Push them all the way
through, Rog.


551
0:20:22,42 --> 0:20:26,791
DADDY: So our shelter can also
transform into a water vehicle.


552
0:20:26,791 --> 0:20:28,359
PETE: It's not going, Michael?


553
0:20:28,359 --> 0:20:30,962
MICHAEL: Yeah, it's just...
ROG: Stay with it.


554
0:20:30,962 --> 0:20:32,997
MICHAEL: On the riverbank,
it ain't as easy as you'd think.


555
0:20:32,997 --> 0:20:36,501
DADDY: Most of this country
was explored by waterways.


556
0:20:36,501 --> 0:20:37,735
MICHAEL: There it is.


557
0:20:37,735 --> 0:20:40,4
DADDY: And escaping from
Armageddon by boat


558
0:20:40,4 --> 0:20:42,206
is a lot easier than
doing it by foot.


559
0:20:42,206 --> 0:20:44,609
TRAVIS: Hey, let's put all
the guns in here,


560
0:20:44,609 --> 0:20:46,678
and then our shoes when we get
ready to get out in the water.


561
0:20:46,678 --> 0:20:47,779
We don't need
to get them all wet.


562
0:20:47,779 --> 0:20:49,447
MICHAEL: Here's a gun.


563
0:20:49,447 --> 0:20:51,582
TRAVIS: We ready?


564
0:20:51,582 --> 0:20:54,85
Woo, the water's cold,
by the way.


565
0:20:54,85 --> 0:20:55,386
Daddy, you get on,
I'll push you.


566
0:20:55,386 --> 0:20:56,788
ROG: He got the best spot.


567
0:20:56,788 --> 0:20:58,423
MICHAEL: Yeah, I did get
the best spot.


568
0:20:58,423 --> 0:21:1,59
TRAVIS: We're out, we're out,
get on, Pete, get on.


569
0:21:1,59 --> 0:21:3,161
PETE: We're gone, guys.


570
0:21:3,161 --> 0:21:4,962
TRAVIS: Alright.


571
0:21:4,962 --> 0:21:7,31
SLOTH: There they are,
there they are!


572
0:21:7,31 --> 0:21:9,1
PETE:
Paddle for your lives, boys.


573
0:21:9,1 --> 0:21:10,535
SLOTH:
Let's see if we can get 'em.


574
0:21:10,535 --> 0:21:12,437
ROG: I had my own secret weapon.


575
0:21:12,437 --> 0:21:13,805
TRAVIS: Go that way.


576
0:21:13,805 --> 0:21:15,807
ROG: I knew Charlie packed
some battery-powered drills,


577
0:21:15,807 --> 0:21:18,42
so I thought I'd bring along
a big paint stirrer,


578
0:21:18,42 --> 0:21:21,779
so now we have
an outboard motor.


579
0:21:21,779 --> 0:21:25,35
[laughter]


580
0:21:25,35 --> 0:21:27,785
SLOTH: I thought we had them
trapped down by the riverbank.


581
0:21:27,785 --> 0:21:29,754
Oh, man.


582
0:21:29,754 --> 0:21:31,255
I knew they were
gonna be mobile,


583
0:21:31,255 --> 0:21:37,462
but I didn't know they were
gonna have a doggone boat.


584
0:21:37,462 --> 0:21:38,596
That's it.


585
0:21:38,596 --> 0:21:40,732
They got away.


586
0:21:40,732 --> 0:21:42,934
Good effort, guys.


587
0:21:42,934 --> 0:21:44,635
I mean, if it wouldn't have been
for that stupid trip wire,


588
0:21:44,635 --> 0:21:45,87
I think we'd have had them.


589
0:21:45,87 --> 0:21:47,872
MAN: Yeah.
SLOTH: We'll get 'em next time.


590
0:21:47,872 --> 0:21:49,674
SLOTH: It ain't
the end of the world.


591
0:21:49,674 --> 0:21:52,11
[laughs]


592
0:21:52,11 --> 0:21:53,411
TRAVIS: We got away from them.


593
0:21:53,411 --> 0:21:55,213
They're over yonder,
and we're out of range.


594
0:21:55,213 --> 0:21:57,749
Our barrel boat is
floating just fine.


595
0:21:57,749 --> 0:21:59,25
It's taking us on down the river


596
0:21:59,25 --> 0:22:1,986
to our new lives
after Armageddon.


597
0:22:1,986 --> 0:22:3,221
Kind of peaceful for
the end of the world.


598
0:22:3,221 --> 0:22:4,255
DADDY: Hand me the fishing rod,


599
0:22:4,255 --> 0:22:5,556
I want to see if I can
catch us a fish.


600
0:22:5,556 --> 0:22:6,591
TRAVIS: A fishing rod?


601
0:22:6,591 --> 0:22:7,692
DADDY: Yeah.


602
0:22:7,692 --> 0:22:9,727
TRAVIS: We didn't bring
a fishing rod.


603
0:22:9,727 --> 0:22:10,895
ROG: It's at the bottom
of this barrel.


604
0:22:10,895 --> 0:22:12,23
TRAVIS: Your barrel's over here.


605
0:22:12,23 --> 0:22:13,531
DADDY: No, I didn't pack it,


606
0:22:13,531 --> 0:22:15,867
I told you to pack it and put it
in that middle barrel.


607
0:22:15,867 --> 0:22:17,235
TRAVIS: I didn't bring
any fishing stuff.


608
0:22:17,235 --> 0:24:17,235
MICHAEL: Well, it's in one of
these other barrels.
