JIM LEHRER: Good evening from the Magness
Arena at the University of Denver in Denver,


2
0:0:5,43 --> 0:0:12,34
Colorado. I'm Jim Lehrer of the PBS NewsHour,
and I welcome you to the first of the 2012


3
0:0:12,34 --> 0:0:17,35
presidential debates between President Barack
Obama, the Democratic nominee, and former


4
0:0:17,35 --> 0:0:22,21
Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, the Republican
nominee.


5
0:0:22,21 --> 0:0:27,85
This debate and the next three — two presidential,
one vice- presidential — are sponsored by


6
0:0:27,85 --> 0:0:31,7
the Commission on Presidential Debates.


7
0:0:31,7 --> 0:0:37,239
Tonight's 90 minutes will be about domestic
issues, and will follow a format designed


8
0:0:37,239 --> 0:0:43,93
by the commission. There will be six roughly
15-minute segments, with two-minute answers


9
0:0:43,93 --> 0:0:49,73
for the first question, then open discussion
for the remainder of each segment.


10
0:0:49,73 --> 0:0:55,539
Thousands of people offered suggestions on
segment subjects of questions via the Internet


11
0:0:55,539 --> 0:1:1,8
and other means, but I made the final selections,
and for the record, they were not submitted


12
0:1:1,8 --> 0:1:4,759
for approval to the commission or the candidates.


13
0:1:4,759 --> 0:1:12,2
The segments, as I announced in advance, will
be three on the economy and one each on health


14
0:1:12,2 --> 0:1:20,9
care, the role of government, and governing,
with an emphasis throughout on differences,


15
0:1:20,9 --> 0:1:26,99
specifics and choices. Both candidates will
also have two-minute closing statements.


16
0:1:26,99 --> 0:1:32,84
The audience here in the hall has promised
to remain silent. No cheers, applause, boos,


17
0:1:32,84 --> 0:1:39,24
hisses — among other noisy distracting things
— so we may all concentrate on what the


18
0:1:39,24 --> 0:1:46,119
candidates have to say. There is a noise exception
right now, though, as we welcome President


19
0:1:46,119 --> 0:2:11,25
Obama and Governor Romney. (Cheers, applause.)


20
0:2:11,25 --> 0:2:20,69
Gentlemen, welcome to you both.


21
0:2:20,69 --> 0:2:28,68
Let's start the economy, segment one. And
let's begin with jobs. What are the major


22
0:2:28,68 --> 0:2:37,64
differences between the two of you about how
you would go about creating new jobs? You


23
0:2:37,64 --> 0:2:41,87
have two minutes — each of you have two
minutes to start. The coin toss has determined,


24
0:2:41,87 --> 0:2:41,87
Mr. President, you go first.


25
0:2:41,87 --> 0:2:45,989
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Well, thank you very
much, Jim, for this opportunity. I want to


26
0:2:45,989 --> 0:2:49,6
thank Governor Romney and the University of
Denver for your hospitality.


27
0:2:49,6 --> 0:2:54,76
There are a lot of points that I want to make
tonight, but the most important one is that


28
0:2:54,76 --> 0:3:0,2
20 years ago I became the luckiest man on
earth because Michelle Obama agreed to marry


29
0:3:0,2 --> 0:3:6,79
me. (Laughter.) And so I just want to wish,
Sweetie, you happy anniversary and let you


30
0:3:6,79 --> 0:3:10,519
know that a year from now, we will not be
celebrating it in front of 40 million people.


31
0:3:10,519 --> 0:3:11,319
(Laughter.)


32
0:3:11,319 --> 0:3:18,9
You know, four years ago we went through the
worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.


33
0:3:18,9 --> 0:3:23,92
Millions of jobs were lost. The auto industry
was on the brink of collapse. The financial


34
0:3:23,92 --> 0:3:30,599
system had frozen up. And because of the resilience
and the determination of the American people,


35
0:3:30,599 --> 0:3:32,209
we've begun to fight our way back.


36
0:3:32,209 --> 0:3:38,409
Over the last 30 months, we've seen 5 million
jobs in the private sector created. The auto


37
0:3:38,409 --> 0:3:45,249
industry has come roaring back and housing
has begun to rise. But we all know that we've


38
0:3:45,249 --> 0:3:49,95
still got a lot of work to do. And so the
question here tonight is not where we've been


39
0:3:49,95 --> 0:3:58,969
but where we're going. Governor Romney has
a perspective that says if we cut taxes, skewed


40
0:3:58,969 --> 0:4:3,579
towards the wealthy, and roll back regulations
that we'll be better off.


41
0:4:3,579 --> 0:4:7,969
I've got a different view. I think we've got
to invest in education and training. I think


42
0:4:7,969 --> 0:4:12,99
it's important for us to develop new sources
of energy here in America, that we change


43
0:4:12,99 --> 0:4:16,26
our tax code to make sure that we're helping
small businesses and companies that are investing


44
0:4:16,26 --> 0:4:21,6
here in the United States, that we take some
of the money that we're saving as we wind


45
0:4:21,6 --> 0:4:27,94
down two wars to rebuild America and that
we reduce our deficit in a balanced way that


46
0:4:27,94 --> 0:4:30,37
allows us to make these critical investments.


47
0:4:30,37 --> 0:4:35,15
Now, it ultimately is going to be up to the
voters, to you, which path we should take.


48
0:4:35,15 --> 0:4:39,87
Are we going to double down on the top-down
economic policies that helped to get us into


49
0:4:39,87 --> 0:4:46,56
this mess, or do we embrace a new economic
patriotism that says, America does best when


50
0:4:46,56 --> 0:4:49,52
the middle class does best? And I'm looking
forward to having that debate.


51
0:4:49,52 --> 0:4:51,0
MR. LEHRER: Governor Romney, two minutes.


52
0:4:51,0 --> 0:4:54,199
MR. ROMNEY: Thank you, Jim. It's an honor
to be here with you, and I appreciate the


53
0:4:54,199 --> 0:4:58,2
chance to be with the president. I am pleased
to be at the University of Denver, appreciate


54
0:4:58,2 --> 0:5:2,33
their welcome and also the presidential commission
on these debates.


55
0:5:2,33 --> 0:5:5,889
And congratulations to you, Mr. President,
on your anniversary. I'm sure this was the


56
0:5:5,889 --> 0:5:11,61
most romantic place you could imagine here
— here with me, so I — (laughter) — congratulations.


57
0:5:11,61 --> 0:5:17,11
This is obviously a very tender topic. I've
had the occasion over the last couple of years


58
0:5:17,11 --> 0:5:22,15
of meeting people across the country. I was
in Dayton, Ohio, and a woman grabbed my arm,


59
0:5:22,15 --> 0:5:25,65
and she said, I've been out of work since
May. Can you help me?


60
0:5:25,65 --> 0:5:31,509
Ann yesterday was a rally in Denver, and a
woman came up to her with a baby in her arms


61
0:5:31,509 --> 0:5:36,83
and said, Ann, my husband has had four jobs
in three years, part-time jobs. He's lost


62
0:5:36,83 --> 0:5:41,669
his most recent job, and we've now just lost
our home. Can you help us?


63
0:5:41,669 --> 0:5:47,539
And the answer is yes, we can help, but it's
going to take a different path, not the one


64
0:5:47,539 --> 0:5:53,52
we've been on, not the one the president describes
as a top-down, cut taxes for the rich. That's


65
0:5:53,52 --> 0:5:54,77
not what I'm going to do.


66
0:5:54,77 --> 0:5:59,949
My plan has five basic parts. One, get us
energy independent, North American energy


67
0:5:59,949 --> 0:6:4,84
independent. That creates about four million
jobs. Number two, open up more trade, particularly


68
0:6:4,84 --> 0:6:9,58
in Latin America; crack down on China if and
when they cheat. Number three, make sure our


69
0:6:9,58 --> 0:6:13,78
people have the skills they need to succeed
and the best schools in the world. We're far


70
0:6:13,78 --> 0:6:20,139
away from that now. Number four, get us to
a balanced budget. Number five, champion small


71
0:6:20,139 --> 0:6:20,789
business.


72
0:6:20,789 --> 0:6:26,6
It's small business that creates the jobs
in America. And over the last four years small-business


73
0:6:26,6 --> 0:6:30,22
people have decided that America may not be
the place to open a new business, because


74
0:6:30,22 --> 0:6:36,21
new business startups are down to a 30-year
low. I know what it takes to get small business


75
0:6:36,21 --> 0:6:37,87
growing again, to hire people.


76
0:6:37,87 --> 0:6:42,479
Now, I'm concerned that the path that we're
on has just been unsuccessful. The president


77
0:6:42,479 --> 0:6:47,8
has a view very similar to the view he had
when he ran four years ago, that a bigger


78
0:6:47,8 --> 0:6:52,61
government, spending more, taxing more, regulating
more — if you will, trickle-down government


79
0:6:52,61 --> 0:6:57,27
would work. That's not the right answer for
America. I'll restore the vitality that gets


80
0:6:57,27 --> 0:6:59,5
America working again.


81
0:6:59,5 --> 0:6:59,53
Thank you.


82
0:6:59,53 --> 0:7:4,43
MR. LEHRER: Mr. President, please respond
directly to what the governor just said about


83
0:7:4,43 --> 0:7:9,8
trickle-down — his trickle-down approach.
He's — as he said yours is.


84
0:7:9,8 --> 0:7:14,479
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, let me talk specifically
about what I think we need to do.


85
0:7:14,479 --> 0:7:20,349
First, we've got to improve our education
system. And we've made enormous progress drawing


86
0:7:20,349 --> 0:7:26,12
on ideas both from Democrats and Republicans
that are already starting to show gains in


87
0:7:26,12 --> 0:7:30,53
some of the toughest-to- deal-with schools.
We've got a program called Race to the Top


88
0:7:30,53 --> 0:7:37,25
that has prompted reforms in 46 states around
the country, raising standards, improving


89
0:7:37,25 --> 0:7:41,86
how we train teachers. So now I want to hire
another hundred thousand new math and science


90
0:7:41,86 --> 0:7:47,4
teachers and create 2 million more slots in
our community colleges so that people can


91
0:7:47,4 --> 0:7:51,43
get trained for the jobs that are out there
right now. And I want to make sure that we


92
0:7:51,43 --> 0:7:54,56
keep tuition low for our young people.


93
0:7:54,56 --> 0:7:59,849
When it comes to our tax code, Governor Romney
and I both agree that our corporate tax rate


94
0:7:59,849 --> 0:8:6,39
is too high. So I want to lower it, particularly
for manufacturing, taking it down to 25 percent.


95
0:8:6,39 --> 0:8:12,319
But I also want to close those loopholes that
are giving incentives for companies that are


96
0:8:12,319 --> 0:8:16,25
shipping jobs overseas. I want to provide
tax breaks for companies that are investing


97
0:8:16,25 --> 0:8:18,349
here in the United States.


98
0:8:18,349 --> 0:8:23,34
On energy, Governor Romney and I, we both
agree that we've got to boost American energy


99
0:8:23,34 --> 0:8:24,379
production.


100
0:8:24,379 --> 0:8:31,379
And oil and natural gas production are higher
than they've been in years. But I also believe


101
0:8:31,379 --> 0:8:36,27
that we've got to look at the energy source
of the future, like wind and solar and biofuels,


102
0:8:36,27 --> 0:8:38,23
and make those investments.


103
0:8:38,23 --> 0:8:42,75
So, all of this is possible. Now, in order
for us to do it, we do have to close our deficit,


104
0:8:42,75 --> 0:8:47,2
and one of the things I'm sure we'll be discussing
tonight is, how do we deal with our tax code,


105
0:8:47,2 --> 0:8:51,7
and how do we make sure that we are reducing
spending in a responsible way, but also how


106
0:8:51,7 --> 0:8:55,73
do we have enough revenue to make those investments?
And this is where there's a difference because


107
0:8:55,73 --> 0:9:2,78
Governor Romney's central economic plan calls
for a $5 trillion tax cut, on top of the extension


108
0:9:2,78 --> 0:9:7,0
of the Bush tax cuts, so that's another $2
trillion, and $2 trillion in additional military


109
0:9:7,0 --> 0:9:13,17
spending that the military hasn't asked for.
That's $8 trillion. How we pay for that, reduce


110
0:9:13,17 --> 0:9:18,82
the deficit and make the investments that
we need to make without dumping those costs


111
0:9:18,82 --> 0:9:22,23
on the middle-class Americans I think is one
of the central questions of this campaign.


112
0:9:22,23 --> 0:9:26,68
MR. LEHRER: Both of you have spoken about
a lot of different things, and we're going


113
0:9:26,68 --> 0:9:30,68
to try to get through them in as specific
a way as we possibly can.


114
0:9:30,68 --> 0:9:34,5
But first, Governor Romney, do you have a
question that you'd like to ask the president


115
0:9:34,5 --> 0:9:36,6
directly about something he just said?


116
0:9:36,6 --> 0:9:39,39
MR. ROMNEY: Well, sure. I'd like to clear
up the record and go through it piece by piece.


117
0:9:39,39 --> 0:9:44,5
First of all, I don't have a $5 trillion tax
cut. I don't have a tax cut of a scale that


118
0:9:44,5 --> 0:9:48,65
you're talking about. My view is that we ought
to provide tax relief to people in the middle


119
0:9:48,65 --> 0:9:53,36
class. But I'm not going to reduce the share
of taxes paid by high- income people. High-income


120
0:9:53,36 --> 0:9:56,94
people are doing just fine in this economy.
They'll do fine whether you're president or


121
0:9:56,94 --> 0:9:57,55
I am.


122
0:9:57,55 --> 0:10:1,98
The people who are having the hard time right
now are middle- income Americans. Under the


123
0:10:1,98 --> 0:10:5,9
president's policies, middle-income Americans
have been buried. They're — they're just


124
0:10:5,9 --> 0:10:12,91
being crushed. Middle-income Americans have
seen their income come down by $4,300. This


125
0:10:12,91 --> 0:10:18,4
is a — this is a tax in and of itself. I'll
call it the economy tax. It's been crushing.


126
0:10:18,4 --> 0:10:22,47
The same time, gasoline prices have doubled
under the president, electric rates are up,


127
0:10:22,47 --> 0:10:28,63
food prices are up, health care costs have
gone up by $2,500 a family.


128
0:10:28,63 --> 0:10:31,8
Middle-income families are being crushed.
And so the question is how to get them going


129
0:10:31,8 --> 0:10:36,46
again, and I've described it. It's energy
and trade, the right kind of training programs,


130
0:10:36,46 --> 0:10:41,6
balancing our budget and helping small business.
Those are the — the cornerstones of my plan.


131
0:10:41,6 --> 0:10:45,26
But the president mentioned a couple of other
ideas, and I'll just note: first, education.


132
0:10:45,26 --> 0:10:50,54
I agree, education is key, particularly the
future of our economy. But our training programs


133
0:10:50,54 --> 0:10:55,2
right now, we got 47 of them housed in the
federal government, reporting to eight different


134
0:10:55,2 --> 0:11:0,1
agencies. Overhead is overwhelming. We got
to get those dollars back to the states and


135
0:11:0,1 --> 0:11:3,89
go to the workers so they can create their
own pathways to getting the training they


136
0:11:3,89 --> 0:11:6,44
need for jobs that will really help them.


137
0:11:6,44 --> 0:11:10,93
The second area: taxation. We agree; we ought
to bring the tax rates down, and I do, both


138
0:11:10,93 --> 0:11:15,83
for corporations and for individuals. But
in order for us not to lose revenue, have


139
0:11:15,83 --> 0:11:20,25
the government run out of money, I also lower
deductions and credits and exemptions so that


140
0:11:20,25 --> 0:11:23,77
we keep taking in the same money when you
also account for growth.


141
0:11:23,77 --> 0:11:29,0
The third area: energy. Energy is critical,
and the president pointed out correctly that


142
0:11:29,0 --> 0:11:34,83
production of oil and gas in the U.S. is up.
But not due to his policies. In spite of his


143
0:11:34,83 --> 0:11:40,37
policies. Mr. President, all of the increase
in natural gas and oil has happened on private


144
0:11:40,37 --> 0:11:45,86
land, not on government land. On government
land, your administration has cut the number


145
0:11:45,86 --> 0:11:52,74
of permits and license in half. If I'm president,
I'll double them. And also get the — the


146
0:11:52,74 --> 0:11:56,91
oil from offshore and Alaska. And I'll bring
that pipeline in from Canada.


147
0:11:56,91 --> 0:12:1,65
And by the way, I like coal. I'm going to
make sure we continue to burn clean coal.


148
0:12:1,65 --> 0:12:5,58
People in the coal industry feel like it's
getting crushed by your policies. I want to


149
0:12:5,58 --> 0:12:10,69
get America and North America energy independent,
so we can create those jobs.


150
0:12:10,69 --> 0:12:15,71
And finally, with regards to that tax cut,
look, I'm not looking to cut massive taxes


151
0:12:15,71 --> 0:12:20,13
and to reduce the — the revenues going to
the government. My — my number one principle


152
0:12:20,13 --> 0:12:22,58
is there'll be no tax cut that adds to the
deficit.


153
0:12:22,58 --> 0:12:27,7
I want to underline that — no tax cut that
adds to the deficit. But I do want to reduce


154
0:12:27,7 --> 0:12:33,31
the burden being paid by middle-income Americans.
And I — and to do that that also means that


155
0:12:33,31 --> 0:12:38,5
I cannot reduce the burden paid by high-income
Americans. So any — any language to the


156
0:12:38,5 --> 0:12:39,85
contrary is simply not accurate.


157
0:12:39,85 --> 0:12:40,89
MR. LEHRER: Mr. President.


158
0:12:40,89 --> 0:12:46,35
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, I think — let's talk
about taxes because I think it's instructive.


159
0:12:46,35 --> 0:12:53,83
Now, four years ago when I stood on this stage
I said that I would cut taxes for middle-class


160
0:12:53,83 --> 0:12:59,48
families. And that's exactly what I did. We
cut taxes for middle-class families by about


161
0:12:59,48 --> 0:13:6,39
$3,600. And the reason is because I believe
we do best when the middle class is doing


162
0:13:6,39 --> 0:13:7,91
well.


163
0:13:7,91 --> 0:13:13,36
And by giving them those tax cuts, they had
a little more money in their pocket and so


164
0:13:13,36 --> 0:13:19,43
maybe they can buy a new car. They are certainly
in a better position to weather the extraordinary


165
0:13:19,43 --> 0:13:23,31
recession that we went through. They can buy
a computer for their kid who's going off to


166
0:13:23,31 --> 0:13:27,14
college, which means they're spending more
money, businesses have more customers, businesses


167
0:13:27,14 --> 0:13:29,94
make more profits and then hire more workers.


168
0:13:29,94 --> 0:13:36,52
Now, Governor Romney's proposal that he has
been promoting for 18 months calls for a $5


169
0:13:36,52 --> 0:13:42,85
trillion tax cut on top of $2 trillion of
additional spending for our military. And


170
0:13:42,85 --> 0:13:48,12
he is saying that he is going to pay for it
by closing loopholes and deductions. The problem


171
0:13:48,12 --> 0:13:53,2
is that he's been asked a — over a hundred
times how you would close those deductions


172
0:13:53,2 --> 0:13:56,68
and loopholes and he hasn't been able to identify
them.


173
0:13:56,68 --> 0:13:58,25
But I'm going to make an important point here,
Jim.


174
0:13:58,25 --> 0:13:58,9
MR. LEHRER: All right.


175
0:13:58,9 --> 0:14:5,13
PRESIDENT OBAMA: When you add up all the loopholes
and deductions that upper income individuals


176
0:14:5,13 --> 0:14:8,75
can — are currently taking advantage of
— if you take those all away — you don't


177
0:14:8,75 --> 0:14:13,8
come close to paying for $5 trillion in tax
cuts and $2 trillion in additional military


178
0:14:13,8 --> 0:14:19,36
spending. And that's why independent studies
looking at this said the only way to meet


179
0:14:19,36 --> 0:14:25,14
Governor Romney's pledge of not reducing the
deficit — or — or — or not adding to


180
0:14:25,14 --> 0:14:29,24
the deficit, is by burdening middle-class
families.


181
0:14:29,24 --> 0:14:34,53
The average middle-class family with children
would pay about $2,000 more. Now, that's not


182
0:14:34,53 --> 0:14:38,92
my analysis; that's the analysis of economists
who have looked at this. And — and that


183
0:14:38,92 --> 0:14:43,24
kind of top — top-down economics, where
folks at the top are doing well so the average


184
0:14:43,24 --> 0:14:49,91
person making 3 million bucks is getting a
$250,000 tax break while middle- class families


185
0:14:49,91 --> 0:14:54,12
are burdened further, that's not what I believe
is a recipe for economic growth.


186
0:14:54,12 --> 0:14:55,39
MR. LEHRER: All right. What is the difference?


187
0:14:55,39 --> 0:14:55,81
MR. ROMNEY: Well —


188
0:14:55,81 --> 0:14:57,9
MR. LEHRER: Let's just stay on taxes for —


189
0:14:57,9 --> 0:14:57,96
MR. ROMNEY: But I — but I — right, right.


190
0:14:57,96 --> 0:15:0,14
MR. LEHRER: OK. Yeah, just — let's just
stay on taxes for a moment.


191
0:15:0,14 --> 0:15:0,91
MR. ROMNEY: Yeah. Well, but — but —


192
0:15:0,91 --> 0:15:1,53
MR. LEHRER: What is the difference?


193
0:15:1,53 --> 0:15:3,97
MR. ROMNEY: — virtually every — virtually
everything he just said about my tax plan


194
0:15:3,97 --> 0:15:4,33
is inaccurate.


195
0:15:4,33 --> 0:15:4,92
MR. LEHRER: All right, go —


196
0:15:4,92 --> 0:15:9,63
MR. ROMNEY: So — so if — if the tax plan
he described were a tax plan I was asked to


197
0:15:9,63 --> 0:15:14,26
support, I'd say absolutely not. I'm not looking
for a $5 trillion tax cut. What I've said


198
0:15:14,26 --> 0:15:19,59
is I won't put in place a tax cut that adds
to the deficit. That's part one. So there's


199
0:15:19,59 --> 0:15:23,96
no economist can say Mitt Romney's tax plan
adds 5 trillion (dollars) if I say I will


200
0:15:23,96 --> 0:15:26,64
not add to the deficit with my tax plan.


201
0:15:26,64 --> 0:15:31,46
Number two, I will not reduce the share paid
by high-income individuals. I — I know that


202
0:15:31,46 --> 0:15:34,46
you and your running mate keep saying that,
and I know it's a popular things to say with


203
0:15:34,46 --> 0:15:39,79
a lot of people, but it's just not the case.
Look, I got five boys. I'm used to people


204
0:15:39,79 --> 0:15:43,75
saying something that's not always true, but
just keep on repeating it and ultimately hoping


205
0:15:43,75 --> 0:15:46,83
I'll believe it — (scattered laughter) — but
that — that is not the case, all right?


206
0:15:46,83 --> 0:15:51,16
I will not reduce the taxes paid by high-income
Americans.


207
0:15:51,16 --> 0:15:57,8
And number three, I will not, under any circumstances,
raise taxes on middle-income families. I will


208
0:15:57,8 --> 0:16:1,91
lower taxes on middle-income families. Now,
you cite a study. There are six other studies


209
0:16:1,91 --> 0:16:5,87
that looked at the study you describe and
say it's completely wrong. I saw a study that


210
0:16:5,87 --> 0:16:10,81
came out today that said you're going to raise
taxes by 3(,000 dollars) to $4,000 on — on


211
0:16:10,81 --> 0:16:13,18
middle-income families. There are all these
studies out there.


212
0:16:13,18 --> 0:16:17,39
But let's get to the bottom line. That is,
I want to bring down rates. I want to bring


213
0:16:17,39 --> 0:16:21,27
down the rates down, at the same time lower
deductions and exemptions and credits and


214
0:16:21,27 --> 0:16:24,44
so forth so we keep getting the revenue we
need.


215
0:16:24,44 --> 0:16:30,13
And you think, well, then why lower the rates?
And the reason is because small business pays


216
0:16:30,13 --> 0:16:35,15
that individual rate. Fifty-four percent of
America's workers work in businesses that


217
0:16:35,15 --> 0:16:40,72
are taxed not at the corporate tax rate but
at the individual tax rate. And if we lower


218
0:16:40,72 --> 0:16:44,66
that rate, they will be able to hire more
people.


219
0:16:44,66 --> 0:16:46,12
For me, this is about jobs.


220
0:16:46,12 --> 0:16:46,65
MR. LEHRER: All right. That's where we started.


221
0:16:46,65 --> 0:16:48,88
MR. ROMNEY: This is about getting jobs for
the American people.


222
0:16:48,88 --> 0:16:49,56
MR. LEHRER: Yeah.


223
0:16:49,56 --> 0:16:53,42
Do you challenge what the governor just said
about his own plan?


224
0:16:53,42 --> 0:16:59,34
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, for 18 months he's
been running on this tax plan. And now, five


225
0:16:59,34 --> 0:17:6,59
weeks before the election, he's saying that
his big, bold idea is "never mind." And the


226
0:17:6,59 --> 0:17:13,19
fact is that if you are lowering the rates
the way you describe, Governor, then it is


227
0:17:13,19 --> 0:17:17,549
not possible to come up with enough deductions
and loopholes that only affect high-income


228
0:17:17,549 --> 0:17:25,49
individuals to avoid either raising the deficit
or burdening the middle class. It's — it's


229
0:17:25,49 --> 0:17:27,49
math. It's arithmetic.


230
0:17:27,49 --> 0:17:32,85
Now, Governor Romney and I do share a deep
interest in encouraging small-business growth.


231
0:17:32,85 --> 0:17:40,549
So at the same time that my tax plan has already
lowered taxes for 98 percent of families,


232
0:17:40,549 --> 0:17:48,57
I also lowered taxes for small businesses
18 times. And what I want to do is continue


233
0:17:48,57 --> 0:17:54,1
the tax rates — the tax cuts that we put
into place for small businesses and families.


234
0:17:54,1 --> 0:18:1,48
But I have said that for incomes over $250,000
a year that we should go back to the rates


235
0:18:1,48 --> 0:18:5,259
that we had when Bill Clinton was president,
when we created 23 million new jobs, went


236
0:18:5,259 --> 0:18:9,62
from deficit to surplus and created a whole
lot of millionaires to boot.


237
0:18:9,62 --> 0:18:13,889
And the reason this is important is because
by doing that, we can not only reduce the


238
0:18:13,889 --> 0:18:19,299
deficit, we can not only encourage job growth
through small businesses, but we're also able


239
0:18:19,299 --> 0:18:24,48
to make the investments that are necessary
in education or in energy.


240
0:18:24,48 --> 0:18:28,11
And we do have a difference, though, when
it comes to definitions of small business.


241
0:18:28,11 --> 0:18:33,879
Now, under — under my plan, 97 percent of
small businesses would not see their income


242
0:18:33,879 --> 0:18:39,24
taxes go up. Governor Romney says, well, those
top 3 percent, they're the job creators. They'd


243
0:18:39,24 --> 0:18:40,86
be burdened.


244
0:18:40,86 --> 0:18:45,62
But under Governor Romney's definition, there
are a whole bunch of millionaires and billionaires


245
0:18:45,62 --> 0:18:49,899
who are small businesses. Donald Trump is
a small business. And I know Donald Trump


246
0:18:49,899 --> 0:18:55,75
doesn't like to think of himself as small
anything, but — but that's how you define


247
0:18:55,75 --> 0:19:1,539
small businesses if you're getting business
income. And that kind of approach, I believe,


248
0:19:1,539 --> 0:19:6,7
will not grow our economy because the only
way to pay for it without either burdening


249
0:19:6,7 --> 0:19:15,87
the middle class or blowing up our deficit
is to make drastic cuts in things like education,


250
0:19:15,87 --> 0:19:21,9
making sure that we are continuing to invest
in basic science and research, all the things


251
0:19:21,9 --> 0:19:23,639
that are helping America grow. And I think
that would be a mistake.


252
0:19:23,639 --> 0:19:24,539
MR. LEHRER: All right.


253
0:19:24,539 --> 0:19:26,769
MR. ROMNEY: Jim, let me just come back on
that — on that point.


254
0:19:26,769 --> 0:19:28,269
MR. LEHRER: Just for the — just for the
record —


255
0:19:28,269 --> 0:19:29,549
MR. ROMNEY: These small businesses we're talking
about —


256
0:19:29,549 --> 0:19:31,69
MR. LEHRER: Excuse me. Just so everybody understands
—


257
0:19:31,69 --> 0:19:31,929
MR. ROMNEY: Yeah.


258
0:19:31,929 --> 0:19:34,149
MR. LEHRER: — we're way over our first 15
minutes.


259
0:19:34,149 --> 0:19:35,2
MR. ROMNEY: It's fun, isn't it?


260
0:19:35,2 --> 0:19:36,25
MR. LEHRER: It's OK. It's great.


261
0:19:36,25 --> 0:19:36,96
PRESIDENT OBAMA: That's OK.


262
0:19:36,96 --> 0:19:39,45
MR. LEHRER: No problem. No, you don't have
— you don't have a problem, I don't have


263
0:19:39,45 --> 0:19:43,34
a problem, because we're still on the economy,
but we're going to come back to taxes and


264
0:19:43,34 --> 0:19:46,269
we're going to move on to the deficit and
a lot of other things, too.


265
0:19:46,269 --> 0:19:47,149
OK, but go ahead, sir.


266
0:19:47,149 --> 0:19:48,39
MR. ROMNEY: You bet.


267
0:19:48,39 --> 0:19:52,23
Well, President, you're — Mr. President,
you're absolutely right, which is that with


268
0:19:52,23 --> 0:19:56,58
regards to 97 percent of the businesses are
not — not taxed at the 35 percent tax rate,


269
0:19:56,58 --> 0:20:1,149
they're taxed at a lower rate. But those businesses
that are in the last 3 percent of businesses


270
0:20:1,149 --> 0:20:6,71
happen to employ half — half — of all
of the people who work in small business.


271
0:20:6,71 --> 0:20:11,58
Those are the businesses that employ one quarter
of all the workers in America. And your plan


272
0:20:11,58 --> 0:20:15,37
is take their tax rate from 35 percent to
40 percent.


273
0:20:15,37 --> 0:20:19,779
Now, I talked to a guy who has a very small
business. He's in the electronics business


274
0:20:19,779 --> 0:20:22,34
in — in St. Louis. He has four employees.


275
0:20:22,34 --> 0:20:26,86
He said he and his son calculated how much
they pay in taxes. Federal income tax, federal


276
0:20:26,86 --> 0:20:31,769
payroll tax, state income tax, state sales
tax, state property tax, gasoline tax — it


277
0:20:31,769 --> 0:20:34,999
added up to well over 50 percent of what they
earned.


278
0:20:34,999 --> 0:20:42,6
And your plan is to take the tax rate on successful
small businesses from 35 percent to 40 percent.


279
0:20:42,6 --> 0:20:49,399
The National Federation of Independent Businesses
has said that will cost 700,000 jobs. I don't


280
0:20:49,399 --> 0:20:56,6
want to cost jobs. My priority is jobs. And
so what I do is I bring down the tax rates,


281
0:20:56,6 --> 0:21:0,769
lower deductions and exemptions — the same
idea behind Bowles-Simpson, by the way. Get


282
0:21:0,769 --> 0:21:5,909
the rates down, lower deductions and exemptions
to create more jobs, because there's nothing


283
0:21:5,909 --> 0:21:10,83
better for getting us to a balanced budget
than having more people working, earning more


284
0:21:10,83 --> 0:21:14,86
money, paying — (chuckles) — more taxes.
That's by far the most effective and efficient


285
0:21:14,86 --> 0:21:17,23
way to get this budget balanced.


286
0:21:17,23 --> 0:21:20,659
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Jim, I — you may want to
move on to another topic, but I would just


287
0:21:20,659 --> 0:21:28,19
say this to the American people. If you believe
that we can cut taxes by $5 trillion and add


288
0:21:28,19 --> 0:21:34,909
$2 trillion in additional spending that the
military is not asking for — $7 trillion,


289
0:21:34,909 --> 0:21:41,33
just to give you a sense, over 10 years that's
more than our entire defense budget — and


290
0:21:41,33 --> 0:21:46,7
you think that by closing loopholes and deductions
for the well-to-do, somehow you will not end


291
0:21:46,7 --> 0:21:52,309
up picking up the tab, then Governor Romney's
plan may work for you.


292
0:21:52,309 --> 0:21:59,94
But I think math, common sense and our history
shows us that's not a recipe for job growth.


293
0:21:59,94 --> 0:22:6,249
Look, we've tried this — we've tried both
approaches. The approach that Governor Romney's


294
0:22:6,249 --> 0:22:13,929
talking about is the same sales pitch that
was made in 2001 and 2003. And we ended up


295
0:22:13,929 --> 0:22:21,419
with the slowest job growth in 50 years. We
ended up moving from surplus to deficits.


296
0:22:21,419 --> 0:22:25,85
And it all culminated in the worst financial
crisis since the Great Depression.


297
0:22:25,85 --> 0:22:30,95
Bill Clinton tried the approach that I'm talking
about. We created 23 million new jobs. We


298
0:22:30,95 --> 0:22:37,639
went from deficit to surplus, and businesses
did very well.


299
0:22:37,639 --> 0:22:42,73
So in some ways, we've got some data on which
approach is more likely to create jobs and


300
0:22:42,73 --> 0:22:48,6
opportunity for Americans, and I believe that
the economy works best when middle-class families


301
0:22:48,6 --> 0:22:52,83
are getting tax breaks so that they've got
some money in their pockets and those of us


302
0:22:52,83 --> 0:22:58,11
who have done extraordinarily well because
of this magnificent country that we live in,


303
0:22:58,11 --> 0:23:1,499
that we can afford to do a little bit more
to make sure we're not blowing up the deficit.


304
0:23:1,499 --> 0:23:2,139
MR. LEHRER: OK. (Inaudible) —


305
0:23:2,139 --> 0:23:5,679
MR. ROMNEY: Jim, the president began this
segment, so I think I get the last word, so


306
0:23:5,679 --> 0:23:6,7
I'm going to take it. All right? (Chuckles.)


307
0:23:6,7 --> 0:23:7,629
MR. LEHRER: Well, you're going to get the
first word in the next segment.


308
0:23:7,629 --> 0:23:10,24
MR. ROMNEY: Well, but — but he gets the
first word of that segment. I get the last


309
0:23:10,24 --> 0:23:11,33
word of that segment, I hope. Let me just
make this comment.


310
0:23:11,33 --> 0:23:12,379
PRESIDENT OBAMA: (Chuckles.) He can — you
can have it. He can —


311
0:23:12,379 --> 0:23:13,179
MR. ROMNEY: First of all —


312
0:23:13,179 --> 0:23:14,299
MR. LEHRER: That's not how it works.


313
0:23:14,299 --> 0:23:16,83
MR. ROMNEY: Let me — let me repeat — let
me repeat what I said — (inaudible). I'm


314
0:23:16,83 --> 0:23:22,24
not in favor of a $5 trillion tax cut. That's
not my plan. My plan is not to put in place


315
0:23:22,24 --> 0:23:26,33
any tax cut that will add to the deficit.
That's point one. So you may keep referring


316
0:23:26,33 --> 0:23:29,389
to it as a $5 trillion tax cut, but that's
not my plan.


317
0:23:29,389 --> 0:23:29,779
PRESIDENT OBAMA: OK.


318
0:23:29,779 --> 0:23:34,71
MR. ROMNEY: Number two, let's look at history.
My plan is not like anything that's been tried


319
0:23:34,71 --> 0:23:39,389
before. My plan is to bring down rates but
also bring down deductions and exemptions


320
0:23:39,389 --> 0:23:44,369
and credits at the same time so the revenue
stays in, but that we bring down rates to


321
0:23:44,369 --> 0:23:49,46
get more people working. My priority is putting
people back to work in America. They're suffering


322
0:23:49,46 --> 0:23:54,279
in this country. And we talk about evidence
— look at the evidence of the last four


323
0:23:54,279 --> 0:24:0,46
years. It's absolutely extraordinary. We've
got 23 million people out of work or stop


324
0:24:0,46 --> 0:24:1,61
looking for work in this country.


325
0:24:1,61 --> 0:24:2,21
MR. LEHRER: All right.


326
0:24:2,21 --> 0:24:5,72
MR. ROMNEY: It's just — it's — we've got
— we got — when the president took office,


327
0:24:5,72 --> 0:24:10,919
32 million people on food stamps; 47 million
on food stamps today. Economic growth this


328
0:24:10,919 --> 0:24:16,39
year slower than last year, and last year
slower than the year before. Going forward


329
0:24:16,39 --> 0:24:19,889
with the status quo is not going to cut it
for the American people who are struggling


330
0:24:19,889 --> 0:24:20,169
today.


331
0:24:20,169 --> 0:24:24,69
MR. LEHRER: All right. Let's talk — we're
still on the economy. This is, theoretically


332
0:24:24,69 --> 0:24:32,35
now, a second segment still on the economy,
and specifically on what do about the federal


333
0:24:32,35 --> 0:24:38,11
deficit, the federal debt. And the question
— you each have two minutes on this — and,


334
0:24:38,11 --> 0:24:43,8
Governor Romney you go first because the president
went first on segment one. And the question


335
0:24:43,8 --> 0:24:48,759
is this: What are the differences between
the two of you as to how you would go about


336
0:24:48,759 --> 0:24:50,649
tackling the deficit problem in this country?


337
0:24:50,649 --> 0:24:54,659
MR. ROMNEY: Well, good. I'm glad you raised
that. And it's a — it's a critical issue.


338
0:24:54,659 --> 0:25:0,539
I think it's not just an economic issue. I
think it's a moral issue. I think it's, frankly,


339
0:25:0,539 --> 0:25:5,34
not moral for my generation to keep spending
massively more than we take in, knowing those


340
0:25:5,34 --> 0:25:8,98
burdens are going to be passed on to the next
generation. And they're going to be paying


341
0:25:8,98 --> 0:25:13,179
the interest and the principle all their lives.
And the amount of debt we're adding, at a


342
0:25:13,179 --> 0:25:15,95
trillion a year, is simply not moral.


343
0:25:15,95 --> 0:25:19,94
So how do we deal with it? Well, mathematically
there are — there are three ways that you


344
0:25:19,94 --> 0:25:26,11
can cut a deficit. One, of course, is to raise
taxes. Number two is to cut spending. And


345
0:25:26,11 --> 0:25:30,649
number three is to grow the economy because
if more people work in a growing economy they're


346
0:25:30,649 --> 0:25:33,57
paying taxes and you can get the job done
that way.


347
0:25:33,57 --> 0:25:37,499
The presidents would — president would prefer
raising taxes. I understand. The problem with


348
0:25:37,499 --> 0:25:41,799
raising taxes is that it slows down the rate
of growth and you could never quite get the


349
0:25:41,799 --> 0:25:46,539
job done. I want to lower spending and encourage
economic growth at the same time.


350
0:25:46,539 --> 0:25:50,539
What things would I cut from spending? Well,
first of all, I will eliminate all programs


351
0:25:50,539 --> 0:25:55,34
by this test — if they don't pass it: Is
the program so critical it's worth borrowing


352
0:25:55,34 --> 0:25:59,749
money from China to pay for it? And if not,
I'll get rid of it. "Obamacare" is on my list.


353
0:25:59,749 --> 0:26:2,59
I apologize, Mr. President. I use that term
with all respect.


354
0:26:2,59 --> 0:26:3,289
PRESIDENT OBAMA: I like it.


355
0:26:3,289 --> 0:26:7,169
MR. ROMNEY: Good. OK, good. (Laughter.) So
I'll get rid of that. I'm sorry, Jim. I'm


356
0:26:7,169 --> 0:26:11,549
going to stop the subsidy to PBS. I'm going
to stop other things. I like PBS. I love Big


357
0:26:11,549 --> 0:26:15,19
Bird. I actually like you too. But I'm not
going to — I'm not going to keep on spending


358
0:26:15,19 --> 0:26:18,49
money on things to borrow money from China
to pay for it. That's number one.


359
0:26:18,49 --> 0:26:22,919
Number two, I'll take programs that are currently
good programs but I think could be run more


360
0:26:22,919 --> 0:26:26,44
efficiently at the state level and send them
to state.


361
0:26:26,44 --> 0:26:30,369
Number three, I'll make government more efficient,
and to cut back the number of employees, combine


362
0:26:30,369 --> 0:26:35,35
some agencies and departments. My cutbacks
will be done through attrition, by the way.


363
0:26:35,35 --> 0:26:39,509
This is the approach we have to take to get
America to a balanced budget. The president


364
0:26:39,509 --> 0:26:45,2
said he'd cut the deficit in half. Unfortunately,
he doubled it. Trillion-dollar deficits for


365
0:26:45,2 --> 0:26:50,799
the last four years. The president's put it
in place as much public debt — almost as


366
0:26:50,799 --> 0:26:54,139
much debt held by by the public as all prior
presidents combined.


367
0:26:54,139 --> 0:26:56,39
MR. LEHRER: Mr. President. two minutes.


368
0:26:56,39 --> 0:27:0,999
PRESIDENT OBAMA: When I walked in the Oval
Office, I had more than a trillion dollar


369
0:27:0,999 --> 0:27:6,549
deficit greeting me, and we know where it
came from. Two wars that were paid for on


370
0:27:6,549 --> 0:27:13,1
a credit card. Two tax cuts that were not
paid for, and a whole bunch of programs that


371
0:27:13,1 --> 0:27:19,139
were not paid for. And then a massive economic
crisis.


372
0:27:19,139 --> 0:27:24,549
And despite that, what we've said is, yes,
we had to take some initial emergency measures


373
0:27:24,549 --> 0:27:30,139
to make sure we didn't slip into a Great Depression.
But what we've also said is, let's make sure


374
0:27:30,139 --> 0:27:33,33
that we are cutting out those things that
are not helping us grow.


375
0:27:33,33 --> 0:27:39,149
So, 77 government programs — everything
from aircrafts that the Air Force had ordered


376
0:27:39,149 --> 0:27:45,9
but weren't working very well. Eighteen government
— 18 government programs for education that


377
0:27:45,9 --> 0:27:52,1
were well- intentioned but weren't helping
kids learn. We went after medical fraud in


378
0:27:52,1 --> 0:27:56,82
Medicare and Medicaid very aggressively — more
aggressively than ever before, and have saved


379
0:27:56,82 --> 0:28:1,9
tens of billions of dollars. Fifty billion
dollars of waste taken out of the system.


380
0:28:1,9 --> 0:28:6,519
And I worked with Democrats and Republicans
to cut a trillion dollars out of our discretionary


381
0:28:6,519 --> 0:28:11,7
domestic budget. That's the largest cut in
the discretionary domestic budget since Dwight


382
0:28:11,7 --> 0:28:12,59
Eisenhower.


383
0:28:12,59 --> 0:28:18,369
Now, we all know that we've got to do more.
And so I've put forward a specific $4 trillion


384
0:28:18,369 --> 0:28:21,19
deficit-reduction plan.


385
0:28:21,19 --> 0:28:26,49
It's on a website. You can look at all the
numbers, what cuts we make and what revenue


386
0:28:26,49 --> 0:28:27,61
we raise.


387
0:28:27,61 --> 0:28:34,989
And the way we do it is $2.50 for every cut,
we ask for a dollar of additional revenue,


388
0:28:34,989 --> 0:28:39,57
paid for, as I indicated earlier, by asking
those of us who have done very well in this


389
0:28:39,57 --> 0:28:42,519
country to contribute a little bit more to
reduce the deficit.


390
0:28:42,519 --> 0:28:47,94
And Governor Romney earlier mentioned the
Bowles-Simpson commission. Well, that's how


391
0:28:47,94 --> 0:28:52,58
the commission — bipartisan commission that
talked about how we should move forward suggested


392
0:28:52,58 --> 0:28:58,519
we have to do it — in a balanced way with
some revenue and some spending cuts. And this


393
0:28:58,519 --> 0:29:0,72
is a major difference that Governor Romney
and I have.


394
0:29:0,72 --> 0:29:5,45
Let — let me just finish this point because
you're looking for contrast. You know, when


395
0:29:5,45 --> 0:29:11,82
Governor Romney stood on a stage with other
Republican candidates for the nomination,


396
0:29:11,82 --> 0:29:22,799
and he was asked, would you take $10 of spending
cuts for just $1 of revenue, and he said no.


397
0:29:22,799 --> 0:29:28,489
Now, if you take such an unbalanced approach,
then that means you are going to be gutting


398
0:29:28,489 --> 0:29:34,59
our investments in schools and education.
It means that — Governor Romney talked about


399
0:29:34,59 --> 0:29:38,57
Medicaid and how we could send it back to
the states, but effectively this means a 30


400
0:29:38,57 --> 0:29:43,269
percent cut in the primary program we help
for seniors who are in nursing homes, for


401
0:29:43,269 --> 0:29:44,749
kids who are with disabilities —


402
0:29:44,749 --> 0:29:45,47
MR. LEHRER: Mr. President, I'm sorry —


403
0:29:45,47 --> 0:29:48,309
PRESIDENT OBAMA: And that is not a right strategy
for us to move forward.


404
0:29:48,309 --> 0:29:49,59
MR. LEHRER: Way over the two minutes.


405
0:29:49,59 --> 0:29:50,399
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Sorry.


406
0:29:50,399 --> 0:29:53,529
MR. LEHRER: Governor, what about Simpson-Bowles.
Will you support Simpson-Bowles?


407
0:29:53,529 --> 0:29:56,299
MR. ROMNEY: Simpson-Bowles, the president
should have grabbed that.


408
0:29:56,299 --> 0:29:57,899
MR. LEHRER: No, I mean do you support Simpson-Bowles?


409
0:29:57,899 --> 0:30:2,1
MR. ROMNEY: I have my own plan. It's not the
same as Simpson- Bowles. But in my view, the


410
0:30:2,1 --> 0:30:5,639
president should have grabbed it. If you wanted
to make some adjustments to it, take it, go


411
0:30:5,639 --> 0:30:7,8
to Congress, fight for it.


412
0:30:7,8 --> 0:30:9,82
PRESIDENT OBAMA: That's what we've done, made
some adjustments to it; and we're putting


413
0:30:9,82 --> 0:30:11,95
it forward before Congress right now, a $4
trillion plan, (a balanced ?) —


414
0:30:11,95 --> 0:30:14,119
MR. ROMNEY: But you've been — but you've
been president four years. You've been president


415
0:30:14,119 --> 0:30:17,889
four years. You said you'd cut the deficit
in half. It's now four years later. We still


416
0:30:17,889 --> 0:30:19,19
have trillion- dollar deficits.


417
0:30:19,19 --> 0:30:23,48
The CBO says we'll have a trillion-dollar
deficit each of the next four years. If you're


418
0:30:23,48 --> 0:30:28,2
re-elected, we'll get to a trillion-dollar
debt. You have said before you'd cut the deficit


419
0:30:28,2 --> 0:30:31,94
in half. And this four — I love this idea
of 4 trillion (dollars) in cuts. You've found


420
0:30:31,94 --> 0:30:36,7
$4 trillion of ways to reduce or to get closer
to a balanced budget, except we still show


421
0:30:36,7 --> 0:30:39,919
trillion dollar deficits every year. That
doesn't get the job done.


422
0:30:39,919 --> 0:30:45,399
Let me come back and say, why is that I don't
want to raise taxes? Why don't I want to raise


423
0:30:45,399 --> 0:30:51,179
taxes on people? And actually, you said it
back in 2010. You said, look, I'm going to


424
0:30:51,179 --> 0:30:55,509
extend the tax policies that we have. Now,
I'm not going to raise taxes on anyone because


425
0:30:55,509 --> 0:30:59,49
when the economy's growing slow like this,
when we're in recession you shouldn't raise


426
0:30:59,49 --> 0:31:0,649
taxes on anyone.


427
0:31:0,649 --> 0:31:5,29
Well, the economy is still growing slow. As
a matter of fact, it's growing much more slowly


428
0:31:5,29 --> 0:31:9,169
now than when you made that statement. And
so if you believe the same thing, you just


429
0:31:9,169 --> 0:31:13,799
don't want to raise taxes on people. And the
reality is it's not just wealthy people — you


430
0:31:13,799 --> 0:31:17,749
mentioned Donald Trump — it's not just Donald
Trump you're taxing; it's all those businesses


431
0:31:17,749 --> 0:31:21,999
that employ one-quarter of the workers in
America. These small businesses that are taxed


432
0:31:21,999 --> 0:31:27,369
as individuals. You raise taxes and you kill
jobs. That's why the National Federation of


433
0:31:27,369 --> 0:31:32,97
Independent Businesses said your plan will
kill 700,000 jobs. I don't want to kill jobs


434
0:31:32,97 --> 0:31:33,539
in this environment.


435
0:31:33,539 --> 0:31:36,33
Let me make one more point. And that's — and
that —


436
0:31:36,33 --> 0:31:37,94
MR. LEHRER: Let's let him answer the taxes
thing for a moment, OK?


437
0:31:37,94 --> 0:31:38,73
MR. ROMNEY: OK.


438
0:31:38,73 --> 0:31:39,799
MR. LEHRER: Mr. President.


439
0:31:39,799 --> 0:31:41,85
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, we've had this discussion
before.


440
0:31:41,85 --> 0:31:47,749
MR. LEHRER: No, about the idea that in order
to reduce the deficit there has to be revenue


441
0:31:47,749 --> 0:31:48,85
in addition to cuts.


442
0:31:48,85 --> 0:31:51,95
PRESIDENT OBAMA: There has to be revenue in
addition to cuts. Now, Governor Romney has


443
0:31:51,95 --> 0:31:53,96
ruled out revenue. He's — he's ruled out
revenue.


444
0:31:53,96 --> 0:31:55,9
MR. LEHRER: That's true, right?


445
0:31:55,9 --> 0:31:55,639
MR. ROMNEY: Absolutely.


446
0:31:55,639 --> 0:31:56,48
PRESIDENT OBAMA: OK, so —


447
0:31:56,48 --> 0:31:57,109
MR. LEHRER: Completely?


448
0:31:57,109 --> 0:32:1,58
MR. ROMNEY: I — look, the revenue I get
is by more people working, getting higher


449
0:32:1,58 --> 0:32:5,879
pay, paying more taxes. That's how we get
growth and how we balance the budget. But


450
0:32:5,879 --> 0:32:10,82
the idea of taxing people more, putting more
people out of work — you'll never get there.


451
0:32:10,82 --> 0:32:14,139
You never balance the budget by raising taxes.


452
0:32:14,139 --> 0:32:19,299
Spain — Spain spends 42 percent of their
total economy on government. We're now spending


453
0:32:19,299 --> 0:32:21,32
42 percent of our economy on government.


454
0:32:21,32 --> 0:32:25,32
I don't want to go down the path to Spain.
I want to go down the path of growth that


455
0:32:25,32 --> 0:32:29,2
puts Americans to work, with more money coming
in because they're working.


456
0:32:29,2 --> 0:32:30,2
MR. LEHRER: Yeah.


457
0:32:30,2 --> 0:32:34,97
But Mr. President, you're saying in order
to get it — the job done, it's got to be


458
0:32:34,97 --> 0:32:35,769
balanced. You've got to have —


459
0:32:35,769 --> 0:32:39,39
PRESIDENT OBAMA: If we're serious, we've got
to take a balanced, responsible approach.


460
0:32:39,39 --> 0:32:43,9
And by the way, this is not just when it comes
to individual taxes.


461
0:32:43,9 --> 0:32:50,649
Let's talk about corporate taxes. Now, I've
identified areas where we can, right away,


462
0:32:50,649 --> 0:32:54,749
make a change that I believe would actually
help the economy. The — the oil industry


463
0:32:54,749 --> 0:33:1,94
gets $4 billion a year in corporate welfare.
Basically, they get deductions that those


464
0:33:1,94 --> 0:33:7,609
small businesses that Governor Romney refers
to, they don't get. Now, does anybody think


465
0:33:7,609 --> 0:33:14,559
that ExxonMobil needs some extra money when
they're making money every time you go to


466
0:33:14,559 --> 0:33:18,82
the pump? Why wouldn't we want to eliminate
that?


467
0:33:18,82 --> 0:33:24,609
Why wouldn't we eliminate tax breaks for corporate
jets? My attitude is if you got a corporate


468
0:33:24,609 --> 0:33:29,7
jet, you can probably afford to pay full freight,
not get a special break for it.


469
0:33:29,7 --> 0:33:34,419
When it comes to corporate taxes, Governor
Romney has said he wants to, in a revenue-neutral


470
0:33:34,419 --> 0:33:40,96
way, close loopholes, deductions — he hasn't
identified which ones they are — but thereby


471
0:33:40,96 --> 0:33:46,559
bring down the corporate rate. Well, I want
to do the same thing, but I've actually identified


472
0:33:46,559 --> 0:33:48,109
how we can do that.


473
0:33:48,109 --> 0:33:52,769
And part of the way to do it is to not give
tax breaks to companies that are shipping


474
0:33:52,769 --> 0:33:59,83
jobs overseas. Right now you can actually
take a deduction for moving a plant overseas.


475
0:33:59,83 --> 0:34:4,73
I think most Americans would say that doesn't
make sense. And all that raises revenue.


476
0:34:4,73 --> 0:34:11,56
And so if we take a balanced approach, what
that then allows us to do is also to help


477
0:34:11,56 --> 0:34:15,37
young people, the way we already have during
my administration, make sure that they can


478
0:34:15,37 --> 0:34:20,61
afford to go to college. It means that the
teacher that I met in Las Vegas, wonderful


479
0:34:20,61 --> 0:34:25,84
young lady, who describes to me — she's
got 42 kids in her class.


480
0:34:25,84 --> 0:34:30,99
The first two weeks, she's got them — some
of them sitting on the floor until finally


481
0:34:30,99 --> 0:34:36,679
they get reassigned. They're using textbooks
that are 10 years old. That is not a recipe


482
0:34:36,679 --> 0:34:39,81
for growth; that's not how America was built.


483
0:34:39,81 --> 0:34:44,45
And so budgets reflect choices. Ultimately
we're going to have to make some decisions.


484
0:34:44,45 --> 0:34:49,4
And if we're asking for no revenue, then that
means that we've got to get rid of a whole


485
0:34:49,4 --> 0:34:54,71
bunch of stuff, and the magnitude of the tax
cuts that you're talking about, Governor,


486
0:34:54,71 --> 0:35:0,95
would end up resulting in severe hardship
for people, but more importantly, would not


487
0:35:0,95 --> 0:35:1,77
help us grow.


488
0:35:1,77 --> 0:35:6,12
As I indicated before, when you talk about
shifting Medicaid to states, we're talking


489
0:35:6,12 --> 0:35:13,18
about potentially a — a 30 — a 30 percent
cut in Medicaid over time. Now, you know,


490
0:35:13,18 --> 0:35:20,28
that may not seem like a big deal when it
just is — you know, numbers on a sheet of


491
0:35:20,28 --> 0:35:24,43
paper, but if we're talking about a family
who's got an autistic kid and is depending


492
0:35:24,43 --> 0:35:29,12
on that Medicaid, that's a big problem. And
governors are creative. There's no doubt about


493
0:35:29,12 --> 0:35:33,64
it. But they're not creative enough to make
up for 30 percent of revenue on something


494
0:35:33,64 --> 0:35:37,92
like Medicaid. What ends up happening is some
people end up not getting help.


495
0:35:37,92 --> 0:35:41,63
MR. ROMNEY: Jim, let's — we — we've gone
on a lot of topics there, and — so I've


496
0:35:41,63 --> 0:35:44,7
got to take — it's going to take a minute
to go from Medicaid to schools to —


497
0:35:44,7 --> 0:35:45,7
PRESIDENT OBAMA: (Inaudible.)


498
0:35:45,7 --> 0:35:45,95
MR. LEHRER: Come back to Medicaid, here, yeah,
yeah, right.


499
0:35:45,95 --> 0:35:48,45
MR. ROMNEY: — oil to tax breaks and companies
overseas. So let's go through them one by


500
0:35:48,45 --> 0:35:53,43
one. First of all, the Department of Energy
has said the tax break for oil companies is


501
0:35:53,43 --> 0:35:57,31
$2.8 billion a year. And it's actually an
accounting treatment, as you know, that's


502
0:35:57,31 --> 0:35:59,74
been in place for a hundred years. Now —


503
0:35:59,74 --> 0:36:0,18
PRESIDENT OBAMA: It's time to end it.


504
0:36:0,18 --> 0:36:7,73
MR. ROMNEY: And — and in one year, you provided
$90 billion in breaks to the green energy


505
0:36:7,73 --> 0:36:13,58
world. Now, I like green energy as well, but
that's about 50 years' worth of what oil and


506
0:36:13,58 --> 0:36:18,34
gas receives, and you say Exxon and Mobil
— actually, this $2.8 billion goes largely


507
0:36:18,34 --> 0:36:20,89
to small companies, to drilling operators
and so forth.


508
0:36:20,89 --> 0:36:25,93
But you know, if we get that tax rate from
35 percent down to 25 percent, why, that $2.8


509
0:36:25,93 --> 0:36:29,26
billion is on the table. Of course it's on
the table. That's probably not going to survive,


510
0:36:29,26 --> 0:36:31,86
you get that rate down to 25 percent.


511
0:36:31,86 --> 0:36:38,55
But — but don't forget, you put $90 billion
— like 50 years worth of breaks — into


512
0:36:38,55 --> 0:36:44,66
solar and wind, to — to Solyndra and Fisker
and Tesla and Ener1. I mean, I — I had a


513
0:36:44,66 --> 0:36:48,6
friend who said, you don't just pick the winners
and losers; you pick the losers. All right?


514
0:36:48,6 --> 0:36:52,42
So — so this is not — this is not the
kind of policy you want to have if you want


515
0:36:52,42 --> 0:36:54,19
to get America energy-secure.


516
0:36:54,19 --> 0:36:58,12
The second topic, which is you said you get
a deduction for getting a plant overseas.


517
0:36:58,12 --> 0:37:3,27
Look, I've been in business for 25 years.
I have no idea what you're talking about.


518
0:37:3,27 --> 0:37:4,9
I maybe need to get a new accountant.


519
0:37:4,9 --> 0:37:5,36
MR. LEHRER: Let's —


520
0:37:5,36 --> 0:37:8,51
MR. ROMNEY: But the — the idea that you
get a break for shipping jobs overseas is


521
0:37:8,51 --> 0:37:9,32
simply not the case.


522
0:37:9,32 --> 0:37:9,81
MR. LEHRER: Let's have —


523
0:37:9,81 --> 0:37:11,81
MR. ROMNEY: What we do have right now is a
setting —


524
0:37:11,81 --> 0:37:11,9
MR. LEHRER: Excuse me.


525
0:37:11,9 --> 0:37:14,49
MR. ROMNEY: — where I'd like to bring money
from overseas back to this country.


526
0:37:14,49 --> 0:37:18,71
And finally, Medicaid to states, I'm not quite
sure where that came in, except this, which


527
0:37:18,71 --> 0:37:23,61
is, I would like to take the Medicaid dollars
that go to states and say to a state, you're


528
0:37:23,61 --> 0:37:29,22
going to get what you got last year plus inflation
— inflation — plus 1 percent. And then


529
0:37:29,22 --> 0:37:32,48
you're going to manage your care for your
poor in the way you think best.


530
0:37:32,48 --> 0:37:38,52
And I remember as a governor, when this idea
was floated by Tommy Thompson, the governors,


531
0:37:38,52 --> 0:37:43,51
Republican and Democrats, said, please let
us do that. We can care for our own poor in


532
0:37:43,51 --> 0:37:48,6
so much better and more effective a way than
having the federal government tell us how


533
0:37:48,6 --> 0:37:50,36
to care for our poor.


534
0:37:50,36 --> 0:37:54,68
So let states — one of the magnificent things
about this country is the whole idea that


535
0:37:54,68 --> 0:37:58,97
states are the laboratories of democracy.
Don't have the federal government tell everybody


536
0:37:58,97 --> 0:38:3,16
what kind of training programs they have to
have and what kind of Medicaid they have to


537
0:38:3,16 --> 0:38:4,82
have. Let states do this.


538
0:38:4,82 --> 0:38:7,6
And by the way, if a states get — gets in
trouble, why, we could step in and see if


539
0:38:7,6 --> 0:38:9,8
we could find a way to help them. But —


540
0:38:9,8 --> 0:38:9,42
MR. LEHRER: Let's go.


541
0:38:9,42 --> 0:38:13,14
MR. ROMNEY: But — but the right — the
right approach is one which relies on the


542
0:38:13,14 --> 0:38:13,47
brilliance —


543
0:38:13,47 --> 0:38:13,47
MR. LEHRER: Two seconds.


544
0:38:13,47 --> 0:38:15,31
MR. ROMNEY: — of our people and states,
not the federal government.


545
0:38:15,31 --> 0:38:18,24
MR. LEHRER: Two seconds and we're going on,
still on the economy on another — but another


546
0:38:18,24 --> 0:38:19,45
part of it.


547
0:38:19,45 --> 0:38:19,93
PRESIDENT OBAMA: OK.


548
0:38:19,93 --> 0:38:25,2
MR. LEHRER: All right? All right, this is
this is segment three, the economy, entitlements.


549
0:38:25,2 --> 0:38:31,3
First answer goes to you. It's two minutes.
Mr. President, do you see a major difference


550
0:38:31,3 --> 0:38:32,93
between the two of you on Social Security?


551
0:38:32,93 --> 0:38:39,0
PRESIDENT OBAMA: You know, I suspect that
on Social Security, we've got a somewhat similar


552
0:38:39,0 --> 0:38:43,47
position. Social Security is structurally
sound. It's going to have to be tweaked the


553
0:38:43,47 --> 0:38:50,11
way it was by Ronald Reagan and Speaker — Democratic
Speaker Tip O'Neill. But it is — the basic


554
0:38:50,11 --> 0:38:55,25
structure is sound. But — but I want to
talk about the values behind Social Security


555
0:38:55,25 --> 0:38:59,25
and Medicare and then talk about Medicare,
because that's the big driver —


556
0:38:59,25 --> 0:38:59,85
MR. LEHRER: Sure — it — you bet.


557
0:38:59,85 --> 0:39:1,97
PRESIDENT OBAMA: — of our deficits right
now.


558
0:39:1,97 --> 0:39:8,9
You know, my grandmother, some of you know,
helped to raise me. My grandparents did. My


559
0:39:8,9 --> 0:39:14,31
grandfather died awhile back. My grandmother
died three days before I was elected president.


560
0:39:14,31 --> 0:39:17,94
And she was fiercely independent. She worked
her way up, only had a high school education,


561
0:39:17,94 --> 0:39:24,85
started as a secretary, ended up being the
vice president of a local bank. And she ended


562
0:39:24,85 --> 0:39:30,29
up living alone by choice. And the reason
she could be independent was because of Social


563
0:39:30,29 --> 0:39:36,17
Security and Medicare. She had worked all
her life, put in this money and understood


564
0:39:36,17 --> 0:39:40,3
that there was a basic guarantee, a floor
under which she could not go.


565
0:39:40,3 --> 0:39:44,7
And that's the perspective I bring when I
think about what's called entitlements. You


566
0:39:44,7 --> 0:39:49,7
know, the name itself implies some sense of
dependency on the part of these folks. These


567
0:39:49,7 --> 0:39:53,55
are folks who've worked hard, like my grandmother.
And there are millions of people out there


568
0:39:53,55 --> 0:39:55,55
who are counting on this.


569
0:39:55,55 --> 0:40:2,29
So my approach is to say, how do we strengthen
the system over the long term? And in Medicare,


570
0:40:2,29 --> 0:40:7,59
what we did was we said, we are going to have
to bring down the costs if we're going to


571
0:40:7,59 --> 0:40:12,37
deal with our long- term deficits, but to
do that, let's look where some of the money


572
0:40:12,37 --> 0:40:17,2
is going. Seven hundred and sixteen billion
dollars we were able to save from the Medicare


573
0:40:17,2 --> 0:40:23,51
program by no longer overpaying insurance
companies, by making sure that we weren't


574
0:40:23,51 --> 0:40:26,7
overpaying providers.


575
0:40:26,7 --> 0:40:29,78
And using that money, we were actually able
to lower prescription drug costs for seniors


576
0:40:29,78 --> 0:40:35,72
by an average of $600, and we were also able
to make a — make a significant dent in providing


577
0:40:35,72 --> 0:40:39,78
them the kind of preventive care that will
ultimately save money through the — throughout


578
0:40:39,78 --> 0:40:40,63
the system.


579
0:40:40,63 --> 0:40:46,9
So the way for us to deal with Medicare in
particular is to lower health care costs.


580
0:40:46,9 --> 0:40:51,93
But when it comes to Social Security, as I
said, you don't need a major structural change


581
0:40:51,93 --> 0:40:54,13
in order to make sure that Social Security
is there for the future.


582
0:40:54,13 --> 0:40:55,76
MR. LEHRER: We'll follow up on this.


583
0:40:55,76 --> 0:41:0,4
First, Governor Romney, you have two minutes
on Social Security and entitlements.


584
0:41:0,4 --> 0:41:5,57
MR. ROMNEY: Well, Jim, our seniors depend
on these programs. And I know any time we


585
0:41:5,57 --> 0:41:9,21
talk about entitlements, people become concerned
that something's going to happen that's going


586
0:41:9,21 --> 0:41:14,7
to change their life for the worst, and the
answer is, neither the president nor I are


587
0:41:14,7 --> 0:41:20,18
proposing any changes for any current retirees
or near retirees, either to Social Security


588
0:41:20,18 --> 0:41:25,59
or Medicare. So if you're 60 or around 60
or older, you don't need to listen any further.


589
0:41:25,59 --> 0:41:29,2
But for younger people, we need to talk about
what changes are going to be occurring.


590
0:41:29,2 --> 0:41:33,17
Oh, I just thought about one, and that is
in fact I was wrong when I said the president


591
0:41:33,17 --> 0:41:37,7
isn't proposing any changes for current retirees.
In fact, he is on Medicare. On Social Security,


592
0:41:37,7 --> 0:41:38,68
he's not.


593
0:41:38,68 --> 0:41:45,67
But on Medicare, for current retirees he's
cutting $716 billion from the program. Now,


594
0:41:45,67 --> 0:41:50,71
he says by not overpaying hospitals and providers,
actually just going to them and saying we're


595
0:41:50,71 --> 0:41:54,95
going to reduce the rates you get paid across
the board, everybody's going to get a lower


596
0:41:54,95 --> 0:41:57,96
rate. That's not just going after places where
there's abuse, that's saying we're cutting


597
0:41:57,96 --> 0:42:2,67
the rates. Some 15 percent of hospitals and
nursing homes say they won't take anymore


598
0:42:2,67 --> 0:42:5,35
Medicare patients under that scenario.


599
0:42:5,35 --> 0:42:11,17
We also have 50 percent of doctors who say
they won't take more Medicare patients. This


600
0:42:11,17 --> 0:42:15,92
— we have 4 million people on Medicare Advantage
that will lose Medicare Advantage because


601
0:42:15,92 --> 0:42:24,23
of those $716 billion in cuts. I can't understand
how you can cut Medicare $716 billion for


602
0:42:24,23 --> 0:42:26,39
current recipients of Medicare.


603
0:42:26,39 --> 0:42:29,29
Now, you point out, well, we're putting some
back; we're going to give a better prescription


604
0:42:29,29 --> 0:42:34,91
program. That's one — that's $1 for every
15 (dollars) you've cut. They're smart enough


605
0:42:34,91 --> 0:42:36,98
to know that's not a good trade.


606
0:42:36,98 --> 0:42:42,49
I want to take that $716 billion you've cut
and put it back into Medicare. By the way,


607
0:42:42,49 --> 0:42:46,98
we can include a prescription program if we
need to improve it, but the idea of cutting


608
0:42:46,98 --> 0:42:52,21
$716 billion from Medicare to be able to balance
the additional cost of "Obamacare" is, in


609
0:42:52,21 --> 0:42:56,99
my opinion, a mistake. And with regards to
young people coming along, I've got proposals


610
0:42:56,99 --> 0:43:1,43
to make sure Medicare and Social Security
are there for them without any question.


611
0:43:1,43 --> 0:43:3,6
MR. LEHRER: Mr. President.


612
0:43:3,6 --> 0:43:7,2
PRESIDENT OBAMA: First of all, I think it's
important for Governor Romney to present this


613
0:43:7,2 --> 0:43:13,45
plan that he says will only affect folks in
the future. And the essence of the plan is


614
0:43:13,45 --> 0:43:20,2
that he would turn Medicare into a voucher
program. It's called premium support, but


615
0:43:20,2 --> 0:43:23,2
it's understood to be a voucher program. His
running mate —


616
0:43:23,2 --> 0:43:23,91
MR. LEHRER: And you — and you don't support
that?


617
0:43:23,91 --> 0:43:26,4
PRESIDENT OBAMA: I don't. And — and let
me explain why.


618
0:43:26,4 --> 0:43:28,25
MR. ROMNEY: Again, that's for future people
—


619
0:43:28,25 --> 0:43:28,78
PRESIDENT OBAMA: I understand.


620
0:43:28,78 --> 0:43:29,82
MR. ROMNEY: — right, not for current retirees.


621
0:43:29,82 --> 0:43:33,5
PRESIDENT OBAMA: For — for — so if you're
— if you — you're 54 or 55, you might


622
0:43:33,5 --> 0:43:39,41
want to listen, because this — this will
affect you. The idea, which was originally


623
0:43:39,41 --> 0:43:48,25
presented by Congressman Ryan, your running
mate, is that we would give a voucher to seniors,


624
0:43:48,25 --> 0:43:54,3
and they could go out in the private marketplace
and buy their own health insurance. The problem


625
0:43:54,3 --> 0:43:59,76
is that because the voucher wouldn't necessarily
keep up with health care inflation, it was


626
0:43:59,76 --> 0:44:4,3
estimated that this would cost the average
senior about $6,000 a year.


627
0:44:4,3 --> 0:44:9,25
Now, in fairness, what Governor Romney has
now said is he'll maintain traditional Medicare


628
0:44:9,25 --> 0:44:15,25
alongside it. But there's still a problem,
because what happens is those insurance companies


629
0:44:15,25 --> 0:44:20,44
are pretty clever at figuring out who are
the younger and healthier seniors.


630
0:44:20,44 --> 0:44:26,35
They recruit them leaving the older, sicker
seniors in Medicare. And every health care


631
0:44:26,35 --> 0:44:30,59
economist who looks at it says over time what'll
happen is the traditional Medicare system


632
0:44:30,59 --> 0:44:35,88
will collapse. And then what you've got is
folks like my grandmother at the mercy of


633
0:44:35,88 --> 0:44:41,9
the private insurance system, precisely at
the time when they are most in need of decent


634
0:44:41,9 --> 0:44:42,12
health care.


635
0:44:42,12 --> 0:44:48,87
So I don't think vouchers are the right way
to go. And this is not my own — only my


636
0:44:48,87 --> 0:44:55,94
opinion. AARP thinks that the — the savings
that we obtained from Medicare bolster the


637
0:44:55,94 --> 0:45:2,18
system, lengthen the Medicare trust fund by
8 years. Benefits were not affected at all


638
0:45:2,18 --> 0:45:8,3
and ironically if you repeal "Obamacare" — and
I have become fond of this term, "Obamacare"


639
0:45:8,3 --> 0:45:12,73
— (laughter) — if you repeal it, what
happens is those seniors right away are going


640
0:45:12,73 --> 0:45:17,41
to be paying $600 more in prescription care.
They're now going to have to be paying copays


641
0:45:17,41 --> 0:45:21,4
for basic check-ups that can keep them healthier.


642
0:45:21,4 --> 0:45:30,16
And the primary beneficiary of that repeal
are insurance companies that are estimated


643
0:45:30,16 --> 0:45:35,2
to gain billions of dollars back when they
aren't making seniors any healthier. And I


644
0:45:35,2 --> 0:45:40,15
— I don't think that's right approach when
it comes to making sure that Medicare is stronger


645
0:45:40,15 --> 0:45:40,8
over the long term.


646
0:45:40,8 --> 0:45:44,8
MR. LEHRER: We'll talk about — specifically
about health care in a moment, but what is


647
0:45:44,8 --> 0:45:46,64
— do you support the voucher system, Governor?


648
0:45:46,64 --> 0:45:53,68
MR. ROMNEY: What I support is no change for
current retirees and near-retirees to Medicare


649
0:45:53,68 --> 0:45:57,5
and the president supports taking $716 billion
out of that program.


650
0:45:57,5 --> 0:45:58,55
MR. LEHRER: What about the vouchers?


651
0:45:58,55 --> 0:45:59,51
MR. ROMNEY: So that's — that's number one.


652
0:45:59,51 --> 0:45:59,99
MR. LEHRER: OK. All right.


653
0:45:59,99 --> 0:46:4,22
MR. ROMNEY: Number two is for people coming
along that are young. What I'd do to make


654
0:46:4,22 --> 0:46:9,63
sure that we can keep Medicare in place for
them is to allow them either to choose the


655
0:46:9,63 --> 0:46:14,79
current Medicare program or a private plan
— their choice. They get to — and they'll


656
0:46:14,79 --> 0:46:19,27
have at least two plans that will be entirely
at no cost to them. So they don't have to


657
0:46:19,27 --> 0:46:22,2
pay additional money, no additional $6,000.
That's not going to happen.


658
0:46:22,2 --> 0:46:23,31
They'll have at least two plans.


659
0:46:23,31 --> 0:46:27,49
And by the way, if the government can be as
efficient as the private sector and offer


660
0:46:27,49 --> 0:46:32,27
premiums that are as low as the private sector,
people will be happy to get traditional Medicare,


661
0:46:32,27 --> 0:46:36,2
or they'll be able to get a private plan.
I know my own view is I'd rather have a private


662
0:46:36,2 --> 0:46:39,46
plan. I — I'd just as soon not have the
government telling me what kind of health


663
0:46:39,46 --> 0:46:42,76
care I get. I'd rather be able to have an
insurance company. If I don't like them, I


664
0:46:42,76 --> 0:46:46,19
can get rid of them and find a different insurance
company. But people will make their own choice.


665
0:46:46,19 --> 0:46:50,99
The other thing we have to do to save Medicare,
we have to have the benefits high for those


666
0:46:50,99 --> 0:46:55,8
that are low-income, but for higher-income
people, we're going to have to lower some


667
0:46:55,8 --> 0:46:59,13
of the benefits. We have to make sure this
program is there for the long term. That's


668
0:46:59,13 --> 0:47:0,13
the plan that I've put forward.


669
0:47:0,13 --> 0:47:4,2
And by the way, the idea came not even from
Paul Ryan or — or Senator Wyden, who's a


670
0:47:4,2 --> 0:47:8,9
co-author of the bill with — with Paul Ryan
in the Senate, but also it came from Bill


671
0:47:8,9 --> 0:47:12,4
Clinton's — Bill Clinton's chief of staff.
This is an idea that's been around a long


672
0:47:12,4 --> 0:47:17,25
time, which is saying, hey, let's see if we
can't get competition into the Medicare world


673
0:47:17,25 --> 0:47:22,92
so that people can get the choice of different
plans at lower cost, better quality. I believe


674
0:47:22,92 --> 0:47:23,35
in competition.


675
0:47:23,35 --> 0:47:27,9
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Jim, if I — if I can just
respond very quickly, first of all, every


676
0:47:27,9 --> 0:47:33,14
study has shown that Medicare has lower administrative
cost than private insurance does, which is


677
0:47:33,14 --> 0:47:38,94
why seniors are generally pretty happy with
it. And private insurers have to make a profit.


678
0:47:38,94 --> 0:47:44,27
Nothing wrong with that; that's what they
do. And so you've got higher administrative


679
0:47:44,27 --> 0:47:52,0
costs, plus profit on top of that, and if
you are going to save any money through what


680
0:47:52,0 --> 0:47:57,95
Governor Romney's proposing, what has to happen
is is that the money has to come from somewhere.


681
0:47:57,95 --> 0:48:3,58
And when you move to a voucher system, you
are putting seniors at the mercy of those


682
0:48:3,58 --> 0:48:11,47
insurance companies. And over time, if traditional
Medicare has decayed or fallen apart, then


683
0:48:11,47 --> 0:48:18,89
they're stuck. And this is the reason why
AARP has said that your plan would weaken


684
0:48:18,89 --> 0:48:24,81
Medicare substantially, and that's why they
were supportive of the approach that we took.


685
0:48:24,81 --> 0:48:29,45
One last point I want to make. We do have
to lower the cost of health care. Not just


686
0:48:29,45 --> 0:48:30,1
in Medicare and —


687
0:48:30,1 --> 0:48:30,96
MR. LEHRER: We'll talk about that in a minute.


688
0:48:30,96 --> 0:48:31,83
PRESIDENT OBAMA: — but — but overall.


689
0:48:31,83 --> 0:48:33,5
MR. LEHRER: Go. OK.


690
0:48:33,5 --> 0:48:34,3
PRESIDENT OBAMA: And so —


691
0:48:34,3 --> 0:48:35,42
MR. ROMNEY: That's — that's a big topic.
Could we — could we stay on Medicare?


692
0:48:35,42 --> 0:48:35,53
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Is that a — is that a separate
topic? I'm sorry.


693
0:48:35,53 --> 0:48:38,93
MR. LEHRER: Yeah, we're going to — yeah.
I want to get to it, but all I want to do


694
0:48:38,93 --> 0:48:39,4
is very quickly —


695
0:48:39,4 --> 0:48:40,49
MR. ROMNEY: Let's get back to Medicare.


696
0:48:40,49 --> 0:48:41,58
MR. LEHRER: — before we leave the economy
—


697
0:48:41,58 --> 0:48:42,35
MR. ROMNEY: Let's get back to Medicare.


698
0:48:42,35 --> 0:48:42,9
MR. LEHRER: No, no, no, no —


699
0:48:42,9 --> 0:48:46,29
MR. ROMNEY: The president said that the government
can provide the service at lower —


700
0:48:46,29 --> 0:48:46,29
MR. LEHRER: No.


701
0:48:46,29 --> 0:48:47,37
MR. ROMNEY: — cost and without a profit.


702
0:48:47,37 --> 0:48:47,84
MR. LEHRER: All right.


703
0:48:47,84 --> 0:48:51,37
MR. ROMNEY: If that's the case, then it will
always be the best product that people can


704
0:48:51,37 --> 0:48:53,28
purchase. But my experience —


705
0:48:53,28 --> 0:48:53,3
MR. LEHRER: Wait a minute, Governor.


706
0:48:53,3 --> 0:48:56,92
MR. ROMNEY: My experience is the private sector
typically is able to provide a better product


707
0:48:56,92 --> 0:48:57,7
at a lower cost.


708
0:48:57,7 --> 0:49:2,49
MR. LEHRER: Can we — can the two of you
agree that the voters have a choice, a clear


709
0:49:2,49 --> 0:49:3,87
choice between the two of you —


710
0:49:3,87 --> 0:49:4,25
MR. ROMNEY: Absolutely.


711
0:49:4,25 --> 0:49:4,64
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Yes.


712
0:49:4,64 --> 0:49:5,15
MR. LEHRER: — on Medicare?


713
0:49:5,15 --> 0:49:5,54
MR. ROMNEY: Absolutely.


714
0:49:5,54 --> 0:49:10,4
MR. LEHRER: All right. So, to finish quickly,
briefly, on the economy, what is your view


715
0:49:10,4 --> 0:49:15,54
about the level of federal regulation of the
economy right now? Is there too much, and


716
0:49:15,54 --> 0:49:21,28
in your case, Mr. President, is there — should
there be more? Beginning with you — this


717
0:49:21,28 --> 0:49:25,19
is not a new two-minute segment — to start,
and we'll go for a few minutes and then we're


718
0:49:25,19 --> 0:49:26,84
going to go to health care. OK?


719
0:49:26,84 --> 0:49:32,4
MR. ROMNEY: Regulation is essential. You can't
have a free market work if you don't have


720
0:49:32,4 --> 0:49:36,6
regulation. As a business person, I had to
have — I needed to know the regulations.


721
0:49:36,6 --> 0:49:40,81
I needed them there. You couldn't have people
opening up banks in their — in their garage


722
0:49:40,81 --> 0:49:45,9
and making loans. I mean, you have to have
regulations so that you can have an economy


723
0:49:45,9 --> 0:49:47,55
work. Every free economy has good regulation.


724
0:49:47,55 --> 0:49:50,34
At the same time, regulation can become excessive.


725
0:49:50,34 --> 0:49:51,96
MR. LEHRER: Is it excessive now, do you think?


726
0:49:51,96 --> 0:49:53,7
MR. ROMNEY: In some places, yes, in other
places, no.


727
0:49:53,7 --> 0:49:53,82
MR. LEHRER: Like where?


728
0:49:53,82 --> 0:49:58,8
MR. ROMNEY: It can become out of date. And
what's happened in — with some of the legislation


729
0:49:58,8 --> 0:50:3,34
that's been passed during the president's
term, you've seen regulation become excessive


730
0:50:3,34 --> 0:50:8,48
and it's hurt the — it's hurt the economy.
Let me give you an example. Dodd- Frank was


731
0:50:8,48 --> 0:50:13,72
passed, and it includes within it a number
of provisions that I think have some unintended


732
0:50:13,72 --> 0:50:18,2
consequences that are harmful to the economy.
One is it designates a number of banks as


733
0:50:18,2 --> 0:50:21,95
too big to fail, and they're effectively guaranteed
by the federal government.


734
0:50:21,95 --> 0:50:26,2
This is the biggest kiss that's been given
to — to New York banks I've ever seen. This


735
0:50:26,2 --> 0:50:31,32
is an enormous boon for them. There's been
— 122 community and small banks have closed


736
0:50:31,32 --> 0:50:33,62
since Dodd-Frank. So there's one example.


737
0:50:33,62 --> 0:50:35,45
Here's another. In Dodd-Frank, it says that
—


738
0:50:35,45 --> 0:50:36,55
MR. LEHRER: You want to repeal Dodd-Frank?


739
0:50:36,55 --> 0:50:39,62
MR. ROMNEY: Well, I would repeal it and replace
it. You — we're not going to get rid of


740
0:50:39,62 --> 0:50:43,95
all regulation. You have to have regulation.
And there's some parts of Dodd-Frank that


741
0:50:43,95 --> 0:50:49,21
make all the sense in the world. You need
transparency, you need to have leverage limits


742
0:50:49,21 --> 0:50:50,68
for institutes —


743
0:50:50,68 --> 0:50:51,18
MR. LEHRER: Well, here's a specific — let's
— excuse me —


744
0:50:51,18 --> 0:50:53,43
MR. ROMNEY: Let me mention the other one.
Let's talk the —


745
0:50:53,43 --> 0:50:56,23
MR. LEHRER: No, no, let's do — right now,
let's not. Let's let him respond.


746
0:50:56,23 --> 0:50:56,84
MR. ROMNEY: OK.


747
0:50:56,84 --> 0:51:0,68
MR. LEHRER: Let's let him respond to this
specific on Dodd-Frank and what the governor


748
0:51:0,68 --> 0:51:1,34
just said.


749
0:51:1,34 --> 0:51:8,11
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, I think this is a great
example. The reason we have been in such a


750
0:51:8,11 --> 0:51:17,26
enormous economic crisis was prompted by reckless
behavior across the board. Now, it wasn't


751
0:51:17,26 --> 0:51:22,68
just on Wall Street. You had — loan officers
were — they were giving loans and mortgages


752
0:51:22,68 --> 0:51:27,49
that really shouldn't have been given, because
they're — the folks didn't qualify. You


753
0:51:27,49 --> 0:51:31,79
had people who were borrowing money to buy
a house that they couldn't afford. You had


754
0:51:31,79 --> 0:51:37,26
credit agencies that were stamping these as
A-1 (ph) great investments when they weren't.


755
0:51:37,26 --> 0:51:43,93
But you also had banks making money hand-over-fist,
churning out products that the bankers themselves


756
0:51:43,93 --> 0:51:50,35
didn't even understand in order to make big
profits, but knowing that it made the entire


757
0:51:50,35 --> 0:51:52,41
system vulnerable.


758
0:51:52,41 --> 0:51:59,39
So what did we do? We stepped in and had the
toughest reforms on Wall Street since the


759
0:51:59,39 --> 0:52:3,15
1930s. We said you've got — banks, you've
got to raise your capital requirements. You


760
0:52:3,15 --> 0:52:7,24
can't engage in some of this risky behavior
that is putting Main Street at risk. We're


761
0:52:7,24 --> 0:52:12,0
going to make sure that you've got to have
a living will, so — so we can know how you're


762
0:52:12,0 --> 0:52:16,65
going to wind things down if you make a bad
bet so we don't have other taxpayer bailouts.


763
0:52:16,65 --> 0:52:21,3
In the meantime, by the way, we also made
sure that all the help that we provided those


764
0:52:21,3 --> 0:52:24,95
banks was paid back, every single dime, with
interest.


765
0:52:24,95 --> 0:52:31,43
Now, Governor Romney has said he wants to
repeal Dodd-Frank, and, you know, I appreciate,


766
0:52:31,43 --> 0:52:36,94
and it appears we've got some agreement that
a marketplace to work has to have some regulation,


767
0:52:36,94 --> 0:52:40,77
but in the past, Governor Romney has said
he just wants to repeal Dodd-Frank, roll it


768
0:52:40,77 --> 0:52:48,34
back. And so the question is does anybody
out there think that the big problem we had


769
0:52:48,34 --> 0:52:56,69
is that there was too much oversight and regulation
of Wall Street? Because if you do, then Governor


770
0:52:56,69 --> 0:53:1,68
Romney is your candidate. But that's not what
I believe.


771
0:53:1,68 --> 0:53:3,32
MR. ROMNEY: (Inaudible) — sorry, Jim. That
— that's just not — that's just not the


772
0:53:3,32 --> 0:53:6,35
facts. Look, we have to have regulation of
Wall Street.


773
0:53:6,35 --> 0:53:6,97
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Yeah.


774
0:53:6,97 --> 0:53:10,87
MR. ROMNEY: That — that's why I'd have regulation.
But I wouldn't designate five banks as too


775
0:53:10,87 --> 0:53:16,63
big to fail and give them a blank check. That's
one of the unintended consequences of Dodd-Frank.


776
0:53:16,63 --> 0:53:19,8
It wasn't thought through properly. We need
to get rid of that provision, because it's


777
0:53:19,8 --> 0:53:22,49
killing regional and small banks. They're
getting hurt.


778
0:53:22,49 --> 0:53:26,44
Let me mention another regulation of Dodd-Frank.
You say we were giving mortgages to people


779
0:53:26,44 --> 0:53:30,7
who weren't qualified. That's exactly right.
It's one of the reasons for the great financial


780
0:53:30,7 --> 0:53:35,7
calamity we had. And so Dodd-Frank correctly
says we need to —


781
0:53:35,7 --> 0:53:35,9
MR. LEHRER: All right.


782
0:53:35,9 --> 0:53:38,29
MR. ROMNEY: — have qualified mortgages,
and if you give a mortgage that's not qualified,


783
0:53:38,29 --> 0:53:43,42
there are big penalties. Except they didn't
ever go on to define what a qualified mortgage


784
0:53:43,42 --> 0:53:43,54
was.


785
0:53:43,54 --> 0:53:44,4
MR. LEHRER: All right.


786
0:53:44,4 --> 0:53:47,89
MR. ROMNEY: It's been two years. We don't
know what a qualified mortgage is yet. So


787
0:53:47,89 --> 0:53:53,85
banks are reluctant to make loans, mortgages.
Try and get a mortgage these days. It's hurt


788
0:53:53,85 --> 0:53:54,75
the housing market —


789
0:53:54,75 --> 0:53:55,15
MR. LEHRER: All right —


790
0:53:55,15 --> 0:53:59,97
MR. ROMNEY: — because Dodd-Frank didn't
anticipate putting in place the kinds of regulations


791
0:53:59,97 --> 0:54:4,56
you have to have. It's not that Dodd- Frank
always was wrong with too much regulation.


792
0:54:4,56 --> 0:54:6,79
Sometimes they didn't come out with a clear
regulation.


793
0:54:6,79 --> 0:54:6,99
MR. LEHRER: OK.


794
0:54:6,99 --> 0:54:11,26
MR. ROMNEY: I will make sure we don't hurt
the functioning of our — of our marketplace


795
0:54:11,26 --> 0:54:14,93
and our businesses, because I want to bring
back housing and get good jobs.


796
0:54:14,93 --> 0:54:20,8
MR. LEHRER: All right, I think we have another
clear difference between the two of you. Now


797
0:54:20,8 --> 0:54:25,7
let's move to health care, where I know there
is a clear difference — (laughter) — and


798
0:54:25,7 --> 0:54:28,86
that has to do with the Affordable Care Act,
"Obamacare."


799
0:54:28,86 --> 0:54:34,4
And it's a two-minute new segment, and it's
— that means two minutes each. And you go


800
0:54:34,4 --> 0:54:39,66
first, Governor Romney. You wanted repeal.
You want the Affordable Care Act repealed.


801
0:54:39,66 --> 0:54:39,87
Why?


802
0:54:39,87 --> 0:54:46,39
MR. ROMNEY: I sure do. Well, in part, it comes,
again, from my experience. I was in New Hampshire.


803
0:54:46,39 --> 0:54:50,61
A woman came to me, and she said, look, I
can't afford insurance for myself or my son.


804
0:54:50,61 --> 0:54:55,11
I met a couple in Appleton, Wisconsin, and
they said, we're thinking of dropping our


805
0:54:55,11 --> 0:54:58,91
insurance; we can't afford it. And the number
of small businesses I've gone to that are


806
0:54:58,91 --> 0:55:2,7
saying they're dropping insurance because
they can't afford it — the cost of health


807
0:55:2,7 --> 0:55:6,73
care is just prohibitive. And — and we've
got to deal with cost.


808
0:55:6,73 --> 0:55:11,64
And unfortunately, when — when you look
at "Obamacare," the Congressional Budget Office


809
0:55:11,64 --> 0:55:18,81
has said it will cost $2,500 a year more than
traditional insurance. So it's adding to cost.


810
0:55:18,81 --> 0:55:22,62
And as a matter of fact, when the president
ran for office, he said that by this year


811
0:55:22,62 --> 0:55:28,13
he would have brought down the cost of insurance
for each family by $2,500 a family. Instead,


812
0:55:28,13 --> 0:55:33,46
it's gone up by that amount. So it's expensive.
Expensive things hurt families. So that's


813
0:55:33,46 --> 0:55:34,94
one reason I don't want it.


814
0:55:34,94 --> 0:55:40,65
Second reason, it cuts $716 billion from Medicare
to pay for it. I want to put that money back


815
0:55:40,65 --> 0:55:42,69
in Medicare for our seniors.


816
0:55:42,69 --> 0:55:47,37
Number three, it puts in place an unelected
board that's going to tell people, ultimately,


817
0:55:47,37 --> 0:55:50,83
what kind of treatments they can have. I don't
like that idea.


818
0:55:50,83 --> 0:55:56,45
Fourth, there was a survey done of small businesses
across the country. It said, what's been the


819
0:55:56,45 --> 0:56:0,81
effect of "Obamacare" on your hiring plans?
And three-quarters of them said, it makes


820
0:56:0,81 --> 0:56:6,5
us less likely to hire people. I just don't
know how the president could have come into


821
0:56:6,5 --> 0:56:11,87
office, facing 23 million people out of work,
rising unemployment, an economic crisis at


822
0:56:11,87 --> 0:56:15,93
the — at the kitchen table and spent his
energy and passion for two years fighting


823
0:56:15,93 --> 0:56:19,95
for "Obamacare" instead of fighting for jobs
for the American people.


824
0:56:19,95 --> 0:56:25,78
It has killed jobs. And the best course for
health care is to do what we did in my state,


825
0:56:25,78 --> 0:56:31,11
craft a plan at the state level that fits
the needs of the state. And then let's focus


826
0:56:31,11 --> 0:56:36,34
on getting the costs down for people rather
than raising it with the $2,500 additional


827
0:56:36,34 --> 0:56:36,66
premium.


828
0:56:36,66 --> 0:56:39,67
MR. LEHRER: Mr. President, the argument against
repeal.


829
0:56:39,67 --> 0:56:44,37
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, four years ago when
I was running for office I was traveling around


830
0:56:44,37 --> 0:56:50,32
and having those same conversations that Governor
Romney talks about. And it wasn't just that


831
0:56:50,32 --> 0:56:55,9
small businesses were seeing costs skyrocket
and they couldn't get affordable coverage


832
0:56:55,9 --> 0:56:59,1
even if they wanted to provide it to their
employees; it wasn't just that this was the


833
0:56:59,1 --> 0:57:4,62
biggest driver of our federal deficit, our
overall health care costs. But it was families


834
0:57:4,62 --> 0:57:9,65
who were worried about going bankrupt if they
got sick — millions of families, all across


835
0:57:9,65 --> 0:57:10,21
the country.


836
0:57:10,21 --> 0:57:15,86
If they had a pre-existing condition they
might not be able to get coverage at all.


837
0:57:15,86 --> 0:57:23,1
If they did have coverage, insurance companies
might impose an arbitrary limit. And so as


838
0:57:23,1 --> 0:57:27,72
a consequence, they're paying their premiums,
somebody gets really sick, lo and behold they


839
0:57:27,72 --> 0:57:32,84
don't have enough money to pay the bills because
the insurance companies say that they've hit


840
0:57:32,84 --> 0:57:39,44
the limit. So we did work on this alongside
working on jobs, because this is part of making


841
0:57:39,44 --> 0:57:42,92
sure that middle-class families are secure
in this country.


842
0:57:42,92 --> 0:57:48,7
And let me tell you exactly what "Obamacare"
did. Number one, if you've got health insurance


843
0:57:48,7 --> 0:57:54,27
it doesn't mean a government take over. You
keep your own insurance. You keep your own


844
0:57:54,27 --> 0:57:59,19
doctor. But it does say insurance companies
can't jerk you around. They can't impose arbitrary


845
0:57:59,19 --> 0:58:5,18
lifetime limits. They have to let you keep
your kid on their insurance — your insurance


846
0:58:5,18 --> 0:58:11,67
plan till you're 26 years old. And it also
says that they're — you're going to have


847
0:58:11,67 --> 0:58:17,95
to get rebates if insurance companies are
spending more on administrative costs and


848
0:58:17,95 --> 0:58:21,11
profits than they are on actual care.


849
0:58:21,11 --> 0:58:26,6
Number two, if you don't have health insurance,
we're essentially setting up a group plan


850
0:58:26,6 --> 0:58:32,2
that allows you to benefit from group rates
that are typically 18 percent lower than if


851
0:58:32,2 --> 0:58:35,43
you're out there trying to get insurance on
the individual market.


852
0:58:35,43 --> 0:58:38,56
Now, the last point I'd make before —


853
0:58:38,56 --> 0:58:38,85
MR. LEHRER: Two minutes —


854
0:58:38,85 --> 0:58:39,6
PRESIDENT OBAMA: — before —


855
0:58:39,6 --> 0:58:39,81
MR. LEHRER: Two minutes is up, sir.


856
0:58:39,81 --> 0:58:42,71
PRESIDENT OBAMA: No, I — I think I've — I
had five seconds before you interrupted me


857
0:58:42,71 --> 0:58:50,73
— was — (laughter) — that the irony
is that we've seen this model work really


858
0:58:50,73 --> 0:59:0,22
well in Massachusetts, because Governor Romney
did a good thing, working with Democrats in


859
0:59:0,22 --> 0:59:7,97
the state to set up what is essentially the
identical model. And as a consequence, people


860
0:59:7,97 --> 0:59:14,85
are covered there. It hasn't destroyed jobs.
And as a consequence, we now have a system


861
0:59:14,85 --> 0:59:18,62
in which we have the opportunity to start
bringing down cost, as opposed to just —


862
0:59:18,62 --> 0:59:19,43
MR. LEHRER: Your five —


863
0:59:19,43 --> 0:59:21,23
PRESIDENT OBAMA: — leaving millions of people
out in the cold.


864
0:59:21,23 --> 0:59:23,76
MR. LEHRER: Your five seconds went away a
long time ago. (Laughter.)


865
0:59:23,76 --> 0:59:24,34
PRESIDENT OBAMA: That —


866
0:59:24,34 --> 0:59:29,28
MR. LEHRER: All right, Governor. Governor,
tell the — tell the president directly why


867
0:59:29,28 --> 0:59:31,47
you think what he just said is wrong about
"Obamacare."


868
0:59:31,47 --> 0:59:33,22
MR. ROMNEY: Well, I did with my first statement.


869
0:59:33,22 --> 0:59:33,98
PRESIDENT OBAMA: You did.


870
0:59:33,98 --> 0:59:35,14
MR. ROMNEY: But I'll go on.


871
0:59:35,14 --> 0:59:35,9
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Please elaborate.


872
0:59:35,9 --> 0:59:36,67
MR. ROMNEY: I'll elaborate.


873
0:59:36,67 --> 0:59:37,6
Exactly right.


874
0:59:37,6 --> 0:59:42,18
First of all, I like the way we did it in
Massachusetts. I like the fact that in my


875
0:59:42,18 --> 0:59:47,59
state, we had Republicans and Democrats come
together and work together. What you did instead


876
0:59:47,59 --> 0:59:51,62
was to push through a plan without a single
Republican vote. As a matter of fact, when


877
0:59:51,62 --> 0:59:56,48
Massachusetts did something quite extraordinary,
elected a Republican senator to stop "Obamacare,"


878
0:59:56,48 --> 1:0:0,51
you pushed it through anyway. So entirely
on a partisan basis, instead of bringing America


879
1:0:0,51 --> 1:0:4,92
together and having a discussion on this important
topic, you pushed through something that you


880
1:0:4,92 --> 1:0:8,68
and Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid thought was
the best answer and drove it through.


881
1:0:8,68 --> 1:0:15,48
What we did, in a legislature 87 percent Democrat,
we worked together. Two hundred legislators


882
1:0:15,48 --> 1:0:19,13
in my legislature — only two voted against
the plan by the time we were finished.


883
1:0:19,13 --> 1:0:20,67
What were some differences?


884
1:0:20,67 --> 1:0:24,81
We didn't raise taxes. You've raised them
by a trillion dollars under "Obamacare." We


885
1:0:24,81 --> 1:0:29,61
didn't cut Medicare. Of course, we don't have
Medicare, but we didn't cut Medicare by $716


886
1:0:29,61 --> 1:0:33,63
billion. We didn't put in place a board that
can tell people ultimately what treatments


887
1:0:33,63 --> 1:0:35,11
they're going to receive.


888
1:0:35,11 --> 1:0:40,45
We didn't — we didn't also do something
that I think a number of people across this


889
1:0:40,45 --> 1:0:43,44
country recognize, which is put — put people
in a position where they're going to lose


890
1:0:43,44 --> 1:0:49,9
the insurance they had and they wanted. Right
now, the CBO says up to 20 million people


891
1:0:49,9 --> 1:0:54,19
will lose their insurance as "Obamacare" goes
into effect next year. And likewise, a study


892
1:0:54,19 --> 1:0:59,18
by McKinsey & Company of American businesses
said 30 percent of them are anticipating dropping


893
1:0:59,18 --> 1:1:4,83
people from coverage. So for those reasons,
for the tax, for Medicare, for this board


894
1:1:4,83 --> 1:1:9,79
and for people losing their insurance, this
is why the American people don't want — don't


895
1:1:9,79 --> 1:1:13,57
want "Obamacare." It's why Republicans said,
do not do this.


896
1:1:13,57 --> 1:1:16,96
And the Republicans had a — had a plan.
They put a plan out. They put out a plan,


897
1:1:16,96 --> 1:1:22,69
a bipartisan plan. It was swept aside. I think
something this big, this important has to


898
1:1:22,69 --> 1:1:26,75
be done in a bipartisan basis. And we have
to have a president who can reach across the


899
1:1:26,75 --> 1:1:31,7
aisle and fashion important legislation with
the input from both parties.


900
1:1:31,7 --> 1:1:35,29
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Governor Romney said this
has to be done on a bipartisan basis. This


901
1:1:35,29 --> 1:1:39,2
was a bipartisan idea. In fact, it was a Republican
idea.


902
1:1:39,2 --> 1:1:44,13
And Governor Romney, at the beginning of this
debate, wrote and said, what we did in Massachusetts


903
1:1:44,13 --> 1:1:50,2
could be a model for the nation. And I agree
that the Democratic legislators in Massachusetts


904
1:1:50,2 --> 1:1:55,99
might have given some advice to Republicans
in Congress about how to cooperate, but the


905
1:1:55,99 --> 1:2:1,74
fact of the matter is, we used the same advisers,
and they say it's the same plan.


906
1:2:1,74 --> 1:2:7,25
It — when Governor Romney talks about this
board, for example — unelected board that


907
1:2:7,25 --> 1:2:13,21
we've created — what this is, is a group
of health care experts, doctors, et cetera,


908
1:2:13,21 --> 1:2:21,84
to figure out how can we reduce the cost of
care in the system overall, because the — there


909
1:2:21,84 --> 1:2:25,66
are two ways of dealing with our health care
crisis.


910
1:2:25,66 --> 1:2:30,66
One is to simply leave a whole bunch of people
uninsured and let them fend for themselves,


911
1:2:30,66 --> 1:2:35,4
to let businesses figure out how long they
can continue to pay premiums until finally


912
1:2:35,4 --> 1:2:39,26
they just give up and their workers are no
longer getting insured, and that's been the


913
1:2:39,26 --> 1:2:44,63
trend line. Or, alternatively, we can figure
out how do we make the cost of care more effective.


914
1:2:44,63 --> 1:2:46,7
And there are ways of doing it.


915
1:2:46,7 --> 1:2:52,61
So at — at Cleveland Clinic, one of the
best health care systems in the world, they


916
1:2:52,61 --> 1:2:59,9
actually provide great care cheaper than average.
And the reason they do is because they do


917
1:2:59,9 --> 1:3:3,92
some smart things. They — they say, if a
patient's coming in, let's get all the doctors


918
1:3:3,92 --> 1:3:10,9
together at once, do one test instead of having
the patient run around with 10 tests. Let's


919
1:3:10,9 --> 1:3:14,87
make sure that we're providing preventive
care so we're catching the onset of something


920
1:3:14,87 --> 1:3:22,74
like diabetes. Let's — let's pay providers
on the basis of performance as opposed to


921
1:3:22,74 --> 1:3:30,26
on the basis of how many procedures they've
— they've engaged in. Now, so what this


922
1:3:30,26 --> 1:3:35,92
board does is basically identifies best practices
and says, let's use the purchasing power of


923
1:3:35,92 --> 1:3:41,63
Medicare and Medicaid to help to institutionalize
all these good things that we do.


924
1:3:41,63 --> 1:3:48,13
And the fact of the matter is that when "Obamacare"
is fully implemented, we're going to be in


925
1:3:48,13 --> 1:3:55,47
a position to show that costs are going down.
And over the last two years, health care premiums


926
1:3:55,47 --> 1:4:0,74
have gone up, it's true, but they've gone
up slower than any time in the last 50 years.


927
1:4:0,74 --> 1:4:5,23
So we're already beginning to see progress.
In the meantime, folks out there with insurance,


928
1:4:5,23 --> 1:4:7,24
you're already getting a rebate.


929
1:4:7,24 --> 1:4:13,37
Let me make one last point. Governor Romney
says we should replace it. I'm just going


930
1:4:13,37 --> 1:4:18,54
to repeal it, but we can replace it with something.
But the problem is he hasn't described what


931
1:4:18,54 --> 1:4:22,26
exactly we'd replace it with other than saying
we're going to leave it to the states.


932
1:4:22,26 --> 1:4:28,18
But the fact of the matter is that some of
the prescriptions that he's offered, like


933
1:4:28,18 --> 1:4:32,46
letting you buy insurance across state lines,
there's no indication that that somehow is


934
1:4:32,46 --> 1:4:36,93
going to help somebody who's got a pre-existing
condition be able to finally buy insurance.


935
1:4:36,93 --> 1:4:41,16
In fact, it's estimated that by repealing
"Obamacare," you're looking at 50 million


936
1:4:41,16 --> 1:4:45,44
people losing health insurance at a time when
it's vitally important.


937
1:4:45,44 --> 1:4:49,87
MR. LEHRER: Let's let the governor explain
what you would do if "Obamacare" is repealed.


938
1:4:49,87 --> 1:4:51,53
How would you replace it? What do you have
in mind?


939
1:4:51,53 --> 1:4:55,29
MR. ROMNEY: Let — well, actually — actually
it's — it's — it's a lengthy description,


940
1:4:55,29 --> 1:5:0,0
but number one, pre-existing conditions are
covered under my plan. Number two, young people


941
1:5:0,0 --> 1:5:4,7
are able to stay on their family plan. That's
already offered in the private marketplace;


942
1:5:4,7 --> 1:5:7,64
you don't have — have the government mandate
that for that to occur.


943
1:5:7,64 --> 1:5:12,93
But let's come back to something the president
— I agree on, which is the — the key task


944
1:5:12,93 --> 1:5:17,74
we have in health care is to get the costs
down so it's more affordable for families,


945
1:5:17,74 --> 1:5:23,24
and — and then he has as a model for doing
that a board of people at the government,


946
1:5:23,24 --> 1:5:27,15
an unelected board, appointed board, who are
going to decide what kind of treatment you


947
1:5:27,15 --> 1:5:27,7
ought to have.


948
1:5:27,7 --> 1:5:28,2
PRESIDENT OBAMA: No, it isn't.


949
1:5:28,2 --> 1:5:34,82
MR. ROMNEY: In my opinion, the government
is not effective in — in bringing down the


950
1:5:34,82 --> 1:5:39,34
cost of almost anything. As a matter of fact,
free people and free enterprises trying to


951
1:5:39,34 --> 1:5:43,62
find ways to do things better are able to
be more effective in bringing down the costs


952
1:5:43,62 --> 1:5:48,96
than the government will ever be. Your example
of the Cleveland clinic is my case in point,


953
1:5:48,96 --> 1:5:53,92
along with several others I could describe.
This is the private market. These are small


954
1:5:53,92 --> 1:5:58,16
— these are enterprises competing with each
other, learning how to do better and better


955
1:5:58,16 --> 1:5:58,52
jobs.


956
1:5:58,52 --> 1:6:2,54
I used to consult to businesses — excuse
me, to hospitals and to health care providers.


957
1:6:2,54 --> 1:6:9,28
I was astonished at the creativity and innovation
that exists in the American people. In order


958
1:6:9,28 --> 1:6:12,81
to bring the cost of health care down, we
don't need to have a — an — a board of


959
1:6:12,81 --> 1:6:19,5
15 people telling us what kinds of treatments
we should have. We instead need to put insurance


960
1:6:19,5 --> 1:6:25,3
plans, providers, hospitals, doctors on targets
such that they have an incentive, as you say,


961
1:6:25,3 --> 1:6:29,87
performance pay, for doing an excellent job,
for keeping costs down, and that's happening.


962
1:6:29,87 --> 1:6:31,77
Intermountain Health Care does it superbly
well.


963
1:6:31,77 --> 1:6:32,7
PRESIDENT OBAMA: They do.


964
1:6:32,7 --> 1:6:36,41
MR. ROMNEY: Mayo Clinic is doing it superbly
well, Cleveland Clinic, others. But the right


965
1:6:36,41 --> 1:6:42,8
answer is not to have the federal government
take over health care and start mandating


966
1:6:42,8 --> 1:6:47,82
to the providers across America, telling a
patient and a doctor what kind of treatment


967
1:6:47,82 --> 1:6:53,8
they can have. That's the wrong way to go.
The private market and individual responsibility


968
1:6:53,8 --> 1:6:54,45
always work best.


969
1:6:54,45 --> 1:6:58,76
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Let me just point out, first
of all, this board that we're talking about


970
1:6:58,76 --> 1:7:4,69
can't make decisions about what treatments
are given. That's explicitly prohibited in


971
1:7:4,69 --> 1:7:6,4
the law.


972
1:7:6,4 --> 1:7:11,98
But let's go back to what Governor Romney
indicated, that under his plan he would be


973
1:7:11,98 --> 1:7:18,7
able to cover people with pre-existing conditions.
Well, actually, Governor, that isn't what


974
1:7:18,7 --> 1:7:24,17
your plan does. What your plan does is to
duplicate what's already the law, which says


975
1:7:24,17 --> 1:7:31,89
if you are out of health insurance for three
months then you can end up getting continuous


976
1:7:31,89 --> 1:7:39,76
coverage and an insurance company can't deny
you if you've — if it's been under 90 days.


977
1:7:39,76 --> 1:7:44,56
But that's already the law. And that doesn't
help the millions of people out there with


978
1:7:44,56 --> 1:7:49,19
pre-existing conditions. There's a reason
why Governor Romney set up the plan that he


979
1:7:49,19 --> 1:7:53,5
did in Massachusetts. It wasn't a government
takeover of health care. It was the largest


980
1:7:53,5 --> 1:8:0,42
expansion of private insurance. But what it
does say is that insurers, you've got to take


981
1:8:0,42 --> 1:8:4,98
everybody. Now, that also means that you've
got more customers.


982
1:8:4,98 --> 1:8:11,9
But when Governor Romney says that he'll replace
it with something but can't detail how it


983
1:8:11,9 --> 1:8:17,909
will be in fact replaced, and the reason he
set up the system he did in Massachusetts


984
1:8:17,909 --> 1:8:22,529
is because there isn't a better way of dealing
with the pre-existing conditions problem,


985
1:8:22,529 --> 1:8:25,949
it — it just reminds me of — you know,
he says that he's going to close deductions


986
1:8:25,949 --> 1:8:28,4
and loopholes for his tax plan.


987
1:8:28,4 --> 1:8:32,15
That's how it's going to be paid for. But
we don't know the details. He says that he's


988
1:8:32,15 --> 1:8:40,659
going to replace Dodd-Frank, Wall Street reform.
But we don't know exactly which ones. He won't


989
1:8:40,659 --> 1:8:44,569
tell us. He now says he's going to replace
"Obamacare" and assure that all the good things


990
1:8:44,569 --> 1:8:49,739
that are in it are going to be in there and
you don't have to worry.


991
1:8:49,739 --> 1:8:53,639
And at some point, I think the American people
have to ask themselves, is the reason that


992
1:8:53,639 --> 1:9:1,259
Governor Romney is keeping all these plans
to replace secret because they're too good?


993
1:9:1,259 --> 1:9:5,88
Is — is it because that somehow middle-class
families are going to benefit too much from


994
1:9:5,88 --> 1:9:12,889
them? No, the — the reason is because when
we reform Wall Street, when we tackle the


995
1:9:12,889 --> 1:9:18,19
problem of pre-existing conditions, then,
you know, these are tough problems, and we've


996
1:9:18,19 --> 1:9:22,559
got to make choices. And the choices we've
made have been ones that ultimately are benefiting


997
1:9:22,559 --> 1:9:24,19
middle-class families all across the country.


998
1:9:24,19 --> 1:9:25,279
MR. LEHRER: All right, we're going to move
to a —


999
1:9:25,279 --> 1:9:26,859
MR. ROMNEY: No, I — I have to respond to
that —


1000
1:9:26,859 --> 1:9:26,98
MR. LEHRER: No, but —


1001
1:9:26,98 --> 1:9:32,21
MR. ROMNEY: — which is — which is my experience
as a governor is if I come in and — and


1002
1:9:32,21 --> 1:9:37,389
lay down a piece of legislation and say it's
my way or the highway, I don't get a lot done.


1003
1:9:37,389 --> 1:9:40,849
What I do is the same way that Tip O'Neill
and Ronald Reagan worked together some years


1004
1:9:40,849 --> 1:9:46,59
ago. When Ronald Reagan ran for office, he
laid out the principles that he was going


1005
1:9:46,59 --> 1:9:50,719
to foster. He said he was going to lower tax
rates. He said he was going to broaden the


1006
1:9:50,719 --> 1:9:54,889
base. You've said the same thing: You're going
to simplify the tax code, broaden the base.


1007
1:9:54,889 --> 1:9:55,699
Those are my principles.


1008
1:9:55,699 --> 1:9:59,63
I want to bring down the tax burden on middle-income
families. And I'm going to work together with


1009
1:9:59,63 --> 1:10:4,63
Congress to say, OK, what are the various
ways we could bring down deductions, for instance?


1010
1:10:4,63 --> 1:10:8,869
One way, for instance, would be to have a
single number. Make up a number — 25,000


1011
1:10:8,869 --> 1:10:13,96
(dollars), $50,000. Anybody can have deductions
up to that amount. And then that number disappears


1012
1:10:13,96 --> 1:10:18,11
for high-income people. That's one way one
could do it. One could follow Bowles-Simpson


1013
1:10:18,11 --> 1:10:22,389
as a model and take deduction by deduction
and make differences that way.


1014
1:10:22,389 --> 1:10:27,539
There are alternatives to accomplish the objective
I have, which is to bring down rates, broaden


1015
1:10:27,539 --> 1:10:32,19
the base, simplify the code and create incentives
for growth.


1016
1:10:32,19 --> 1:10:37,7
And with regards to health care, you had remarkable
details with regards to my pre-existing condition


1017
1:10:37,7 --> 1:10:41,499
plan. You obviously studied up on — on my
plan. In fact, I do have a plan that deals


1018
1:10:41,499 --> 1:10:45,489
with people with pre-existing conditions.
That's part of my health care plan. And what


1019
1:10:45,489 --> 1:10:50,61
we did in Massachusetts is a model for the
nation, state by state. And I said that at


1020
1:10:50,61 --> 1:10:55,94
that time. The federal government taking over
health care for the entire nation and whisking


1021
1:10:55,94 --> 1:11:0,63
aside the 10th Amendment, which gives states
the rights for these kinds of things, is not


1022
1:11:0,63 --> 1:11:3,69
the course for America to have a stronger,
more vibrant economy.


1023
1:11:3,69 --> 1:11:13,7
MR. LEHRER: That is a terrific segue to our
next segment, and is the role of government.


1024
1:11:13,7 --> 1:11:18,78
And let's see, role of government and it is
— you are first on this, Mr. President.


1025
1:11:18,78 --> 1:11:24,489
The question is this. Do you believe — both
of you — but you have the first two minutes


1026
1:11:24,489 --> 1:11:28,219
on this, Mr. President — do you believe
there's a fundamental difference between the


1027
1:11:28,219 --> 1:11:33,159
two of you as to how you view the mission
of the federal government?


1028
1:11:33,159 --> 1:11:36,869
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, I definitely think
there are differences.


1029
1:11:36,869 --> 1:11:38,519
MR. LEHRER: And — yeah.


1030
1:11:38,519 --> 1:11:41,809
PRESIDENT OBAMA: The first role of the federal
government is to keep the American people


1031
1:11:41,809 --> 1:11:48,369
safe. That's its most basic function. And
as commander in chief, that is something that


1032
1:11:48,369 --> 1:11:55,28
I've worked on and thought about every single
day that I've been in the Oval Office.


1033
1:11:55,28 --> 1:12:0,9
But I also believe that government has the
capacity — the federal government has the


1034
1:12:0,9 --> 1:12:7,26
capacity to help open up opportunity and create
ladders of opportunity and to create frameworks


1035
1:12:7,26 --> 1:12:12,13
where the American people can succeed. Look,
the genius of America is the free enterprise


1036
1:12:12,13 --> 1:12:18,659
system, and freedom, and the fact that people
can go out there and start a business, work


1037
1:12:18,659 --> 1:12:21,71
on an idea, make their own decisions.


1038
1:12:21,71 --> 1:12:27,53
But as Abraham Lincoln understood, there are
also some things we do better together.


1039
1:12:27,53 --> 1:12:33,469
So in the middle of the Civil War, Abraham
Lincoln said, let's help to finance the Transcontinental


1040
1:12:33,469 --> 1:12:42,999
Railroad. Let's start the National Academy
of Sciences. Let's start land grant colleges,


1041
1:12:42,999 --> 1:12:48,289
because we want to give these gateways of
opportunity for all Americans, because if


1042
1:12:48,289 --> 1:12:52,46
all Americans are getting opportunity, we're
all going to be better off. That doesn't restrict


1043
1:12:52,46 --> 1:12:55,639
people's freedom; that enhances it.


1044
1:12:55,639 --> 1:13:1,469
And so what I've tried to do as president
is to apply those same principles. And when


1045
1:13:1,469 --> 1:13:6,989
it comes to education, what I've said is we've
got to reform schools that are not working.


1046
1:13:6,989 --> 1:13:10,929
We use something called Race to the Top. Wasn't
a top-down approach, Governor. What we've


1047
1:13:10,929 --> 1:13:17,23
said is to states, we'll give you more money
if you initiate reforms. And as a consequence,


1048
1:13:17,23 --> 1:13:21,639
you had 46 states around the country who have
made a real difference.


1049
1:13:21,639 --> 1:13:26,55
But what I've also said is let's hire another
hundred thousand math and science teachers


1050
1:13:26,55 --> 1:13:31,349
to make sure we maintain our technological
lead and our people are skilled and able to


1051
1:13:31,349 --> 1:13:38,219
succeed. And hard-pressed states right now
can't all do that. In fact, we've seen layoffs


1052
1:13:38,219 --> 1:13:43,349
of hundreds of thousands of teachers over
the last several years, and Governor Romney


1053
1:13:43,349 --> 1:13:48,239
doesn't think we need more teachers. I do,
because I think that that is the kind of investment


1054
1:13:48,239 --> 1:13:53,36
where the federal government can help. It
can't do it all, but it can make a difference,


1055
1:13:53,36 --> 1:13:57,619
and as a consequence, we'll have a better-trained
workforce, and that will create jobs, because


1056
1:13:57,619 --> 1:14:0,469
companies want to locate in places where we've
got a skilled workforce.


1057
1:14:0,469 --> 1:14:3,79
MR. LEHRER: Two minutes, Governor, on the
role of government, your view.


1058
1:14:3,79 --> 1:14:7,239
MR. ROMNEY: Well, first, I love great schools.
Massachusetts, our schools are ranked number


1059
1:14:7,239 --> 1:14:12,9
one of all 50 states. And the key to great
schools: great teachers. So I reject the idea


1060
1:14:12,9 --> 1:14:16,4
that I don't believe in great teachers or
more teachers. Every school district, every


1061
1:14:16,4 --> 1:14:18,429
state should make that decision on their own.


1062
1:14:18,429 --> 1:14:24,17
The role of government — look behind us:
the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.


1063
1:14:24,17 --> 1:14:32,159
The role of government is to promote and protect
the principles of those documents. First,


1064
1:14:32,159 --> 1:14:36,679
life and liberty. We have a responsibility
to protect the lives and liberties of our


1065
1:14:36,679 --> 1:14:41,119
people, and that means the military, second
to none. I do not believe in cutting our military.


1066
1:14:41,119 --> 1:14:44,71
I believe in maintaining the strength of America's
military.


1067
1:14:44,71 --> 1:14:50,719
Second, in that line that says, we are endowed
by our Creator with our rights — I believe


1068
1:14:50,719 --> 1:14:56,42
we must maintain our commitment to religious
tolerance and freedom in this country. That


1069
1:14:56,42 --> 1:15:1,5
statement also says that we are endowed by
our Creator with the right to pursue happiness


1070
1:15:1,5 --> 1:15:5,94
as we choose. I interpret that as, one, making
sure that those people who are less fortunate


1071
1:15:5,94 --> 1:15:8,999
and can't care for themselves are cared by
— by one another.


1072
1:15:8,999 --> 1:15:13,21
We're a nation that believes we're all children
of the same God. And we care for those that


1073
1:15:13,21 --> 1:15:17,36
have difficulties — those that are elderly
and have problems and challenges, those that


1074
1:15:17,36 --> 1:15:21,92
disabled, we care for them. And we look for
discovery and innovation, all these thing


1075
1:15:21,92 --> 1:15:28,5
desired out of the American heart to provide
the pursuit of happiness for our citizens.


1076
1:15:28,5 --> 1:15:33,809
But we also believe in maintaining for individuals
the right to pursue their dreams, and not


1077
1:15:33,809 --> 1:15:38,539
to have the government substitute itself for
the rights of free individuals. And what we're


1078
1:15:38,539 --> 1:15:44,51
seeing right now is, in my view, a — a trickle-down
government approach which has government thinking


1079
1:15:44,51 --> 1:15:49,15
it can do a better job than free people pursuing
their dreams. And it's not working.


1080
1:15:49,15 --> 1:15:52,909
And the proof of that is 23 million people
out of work. The proof of that is one out


1081
1:15:52,909 --> 1:15:57,999
of six people in poverty. The proof of that
is we've gone from 32 million on food stamps


1082
1:15:57,999 --> 1:16:3,17
to 47 million on food stamps. The proof of
that is that 50 percent of college graduates


1083
1:16:3,17 --> 1:16:4,809
this year can't find work.


1084
1:16:4,809 --> 1:16:5,7
PRESIDENT OBAMA: (Inaudible) —


1085
1:16:5,7 --> 1:16:9,61
MR. ROMNEY: We know that the path we're taking
is not working. It's time for a new path.


1086
1:16:9,61 --> 1:16:12,71
MR. LEHRER: All right, let's go through some
specifics in terms of what — how each of


1087
1:16:12,71 --> 1:16:19,42
you views the role of government. How do — education.
Does the federal government have a responsibility


1088
1:16:19,42 --> 1:16:22,289
to improve the quality of public education
in America?


1089
1:16:22,289 --> 1:16:26,3
MR. ROMNEY: Well, the primary responsibility
for education is — is of course at the state


1090
1:16:26,3 --> 1:16:29,9
and local level. But the federal government
also can play a very important role. And I


1091
1:16:29,9 --> 1:16:33,98
— and I agree with Secretary Arne Duncan.
He's — there's some ideas he's put forward


1092
1:16:33,98 --> 1:16:37,409
on Race to the Top — not all of them but
some of them I agree with, and congratulate


1093
1:16:37,409 --> 1:16:41,639
him for pursuing that. The federal government
can get local and — and state schools to


1094
1:16:41,639 --> 1:16:42,699
do a better job.


1095
1:16:42,699 --> 1:16:47,59
My own view, by the way, is I've added to
that. I happen to believe — I want the kids


1096
1:16:47,59 --> 1:16:51,789
that are getting federal dollars from IDEA
or — or Title I — these are disabled kids


1097
1:16:51,789 --> 1:16:56,999
or — or poor kids or — or lower-income
kids, rather. I want them to be able to go


1098
1:16:56,999 --> 1:17:1,929
to the school of their choice. So all federal
funds, instead of going to the — to the


1099
1:17:1,929 --> 1:17:5,599
state or to the school district, I'd have
go — if you will, follow the child and let


1100
1:17:5,599 --> 1:17:8,67
the parent and the child decide where to send
their — their — their student.


1101
1:17:8,67 --> 1:17:13,67
MR. LEHRER: How do you see the federal government's
responsibility to — as I say, to improve


1102
1:17:13,67 --> 1:17:15,559
the quality of public education in this country?


1103
1:17:15,559 --> 1:17:18,749
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, as I've indicated,
I think that it has a significant role to


1104
1:17:18,749 --> 1:17:23,48
play. Through our Race to the Top program,
we've worked with Republican and Democratic


1105
1:17:23,48 --> 1:17:27,4
governors to initiate major reforms, and they're
having an impact right now.


1106
1:17:27,4 --> 1:17:31,82
MR. LEHRER: Do you think you have a difference
with your views and those of Governor Romney


1107
1:17:31,82 --> 1:17:33,21
on — about education and the federal government?


1108
1:17:33,21 --> 1:17:39,219
PRESIDENT OBAMA: You know, this is where budgets
matter because budgets reflect choices. So


1109
1:17:39,219 --> 1:17:48,11
when Governor Romney indicates that he wants
to cut taxes and potentially benefit folks


1110
1:17:48,11 --> 1:17:56,42
like me and him, and to pay for it, we're
having to initiate significant cuts in federal


1111
1:17:56,42 --> 1:17:59,99
support for education, that makes a difference.


1112
1:17:59,99 --> 1:18:4,78
You know, his running mate, Congressman Ryan,
put forward a budget that reflects many of


1113
1:18:4,78 --> 1:18:10,34
the principles that Governor Romney's talked
about. And it wasn't very detailed. This seems


1114
1:18:10,34 --> 1:18:15,69
to be a trend. But — but what it did do
is to — if you extrapolated how much money


1115
1:18:15,69 --> 1:18:21,39
we're talking about, you'd look at cutting
the education budget by up to 20 percent.


1116
1:18:21,39 --> 1:18:27,869
When it comes to community colleges, we are
seeing great work done out there all over


1117
1:18:27,869 --> 1:18:31,929
the country because we have the opportunity
to train people for jobs that exist right


1118
1:18:31,929 --> 1:18:35,489
now. And one of the things I suspect Governor
Romney and I probably agree on is getting


1119
1:18:35,489 --> 1:18:39,5
businesses to work with community colleges
so that they're setting up their training


1120
1:18:39,5 --> 1:18:39,619
programs —


1121
1:18:39,619 --> 1:18:40,869
MR. LEHRER: Do you agree, Governor?


1122
1:18:40,869 --> 1:18:42,599
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Let — let — let me just
finish the point.


1123
1:18:42,599 --> 1:18:43,57
MR. ROMNEY: Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.


1124
1:18:43,57 --> 1:18:45,34
PRESIDENT OBAMA: I suspect it'll be a small
agreement.


1125
1:18:45,34 --> 1:18:47,579
MR. ROMNEY: It's going over well in my state,
by the way, yeah.


1126
1:18:47,579 --> 1:18:53,159
PRESIDENT OBAMA: The — where their partnering
so that — they're designing training programs,


1127
1:18:53,159 --> 1:18:56,36
and people who are going through them know
that there's a job waiting for them if they


1128
1:18:56,36 --> 1:19:0,389
complete them. That makes a big difference.
But that requires some federal support.


1129
1:19:0,389 --> 1:19:7,329
Let me just say one final example. When it
comes to making college affordable — whether


1130
1:19:7,329 --> 1:19:11,53
it's two-year or four-year — one of the
things that I did as president was we were


1131
1:19:11,53 --> 1:19:17,989
sending $60 billion to banks and lenders as
middle men for the student loan program, even


1132
1:19:17,989 --> 1:19:22,9
though the loans were guaranteed. So there
was no risk for the banks or the lenders but


1133
1:19:22,9 --> 1:19:23,809
they were taking billions out of the system.


1134
1:19:23,809 --> 1:19:28,789
And we said, why not cut out the middle man?
And as a consequence, what we've been able


1135
1:19:28,789 --> 1:19:36,409
to do is to provide millions more students
assistance, lower or keep low interest rates


1136
1:19:36,409 --> 1:19:42,929
on student loans. And this is an example of
where our priorities make a difference. Governor


1137
1:19:42,929 --> 1:19:50,86
Romney, I genuinely believe, cares about education.
But when he tells a student that, you know,


1138
1:19:50,86 --> 1:19:55,76
you should borrow money from your parents
to go to college, you know, that indicates


1139
1:19:55,76 --> 1:20:1,489
the degree to which, you know, there may not
be as much of a focus on the fact that folks


1140
1:20:1,489 --> 1:20:7,99
like myself, folks like Michelle, kids probably
who attend University of Denver just don't


1141
1:20:7,99 --> 1:20:7,989
have that option.


1142
1:20:7,989 --> 1:20:12,699
And for us to be able to make sure that they've
got that opportunity and they can walk through


1143
1:20:12,699 --> 1:20:16,94
that door, that is vitally important — not
just to those kids. It's how we're going to


1144
1:20:16,94 --> 1:20:18,559
grow this economy over the long term.


1145
1:20:18,559 --> 1:20:20,15
MR. LEHRER: We're running out of time.


1146
1:20:20,15 --> 1:20:20,15
MR. ROMNEY: Jim, Jim —


1147
1:20:20,15 --> 1:20:23,19
MR. LEHRER: I'm certainly going give you a
chance to respond to that. Yes, sir, Governor.


1148
1:20:23,19 --> 1:20:26,11
MR. ROMNEY: Mr. — Mr. President, you're
entitled, as the president, to your own airplane


1149
1:20:26,11 --> 1:20:29,19
and to your own house, but not to your own
facts — (laughter) — all right? I'm — I'm


1150
1:20:29,19 --> 1:20:34,4
not going to cut education funding. I don't
have any plan to cut education funding and


1151
1:20:34,4 --> 1:20:37,92
grants that go to people going to college.
I'm planning on continuing to grow, so I'm


1152
1:20:37,92 --> 1:20:39,469
not planning on making changes there.


1153
1:20:39,469 --> 1:20:43,889
But you make a very good point, which is that
the — the place you put your money makes


1154
1:20:43,889 --> 1:20:50,249
a pretty clear indication of where your heart
is. You put $90 billion into — into green


1155
1:20:50,249 --> 1:20:55,199
jobs. And — and I — look, I'm all in favor
of green energy. Ninety billion (dollars)


1156
1:20:55,199 --> 1:20:59,239
— that — that would have — that would
have hired 2 million teachers. Ninety billion


1157
1:20:59,239 --> 1:21:3,389
dollars. And these businesses — many of
them have gone out of business. I think about


1158
1:21:3,389 --> 1:21:6,65
half of them, of the ones have been invested
in, they've gone out of business. A number


1159
1:21:6,65 --> 1:21:10,55
of them happened to be owned by — by people
who were contributors to your campaigns.


1160
1:21:10,55 --> 1:21:15,44
Look, the right course for — for America's
government — we were talking about the role


1161
1:21:15,44 --> 1:21:20,21
of government — is not to become the economic
player picking winners and losers, telling


1162
1:21:20,21 --> 1:21:25,679
people what kind of health treatment they
can receive, taking over the health care system


1163
1:21:25,679 --> 1:21:29,55
that — that has existed in this country
for — for a long, long time and has produced


1164
1:21:29,55 --> 1:21:33,119
the best health records in the world. The
right answer for government is to say, how


1165
1:21:33,119 --> 1:21:36,949
do we make the private sector become more
efficient and more effective?


1166
1:21:36,949 --> 1:21:41,699
How do we get schools to be more competitive?
Let's grade them. I propose we grade our schools


1167
1:21:41,699 --> 1:21:45,65
so parents know which schools are succeeding
and failing, so they can take their child


1168
1:21:45,65 --> 1:21:49,769
to a — to a school that's being more successful.
I don't — I don't want to cut our commitment


1169
1:21:49,769 --> 1:21:53,429
to education; I wanted to make it more effective
and efficient.


1170
1:21:53,429 --> 1:21:58,67
And by the way, I've had that experience.
I don't just talk about it. I've been there.


1171
1:21:58,67 --> 1:22:2,889
Massachusetts schools are ranked number one
in the nation. This is not because I didn't


1172
1:22:2,889 --> 1:22:7,489
have commitment to education. It's because
I care about education for all of our kids.


1173
1:22:7,489 --> 1:22:7,82
MR. LEHRER: All right, gentlemen, look —


1174
1:22:7,82 --> 1:22:8,449
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Jim, I — (inaudible) —


1175
1:22:8,449 --> 1:22:12,2
MR. LEHRER: Excuse me, one sec — excuse,
me sir. (Laughter.) We've got — we've got


1176
1:22:12,2 --> 1:22:16,829
— barely have three minutes left. I'm not
going to grade the two of you and say you've


1177
1:22:16,829 --> 1:22:20,34
— your answers have been too long or I've
done a poor job —


1178
1:22:20,34 --> 1:22:21,4
PRESIDENT OBAMA: You've done a great job,
Jim.


1179
1:22:21,4 --> 1:22:25,789
MR. LEHRER: Oh, well, no. But the fact is,
government — the role of government and


1180
1:22:25,789 --> 1:22:31,989
governing, we've lost a (pod ?), in other
words, so we only have three minutes left


1181
1:22:31,989 --> 1:22:38,969
in the — in the debate before we go to your
closing statements. And so I want to ask finally


1182
1:22:38,969 --> 1:22:43,65
here — and remember, we've got three minutes
total time here.


1183
1:22:43,65 --> 1:22:48,86
And the question is this: Many of the legislative
functions of the federal government right


1184
1:22:48,86 --> 1:22:56,449
now are in a state of paralysis as a result
of partisan gridlock. If elected in your case,


1185
1:22:56,449 --> 1:22:59,769
if re-elected in your case, what would you
do about that?


1186
1:22:59,769 --> 1:23:0,3
Governor?


1187
1:23:0,3 --> 1:23:4,15
MR. ROMNEY: Jim, I had the great experience
— it didn't seem like it at the time — of


1188
1:23:4,15 --> 1:23:9,349
being elected in a state where my legislature
was 87 percent Democrat, and that meant I


1189
1:23:9,349 --> 1:23:13,219
figured out from day one I had to get along
and I had to work across the aisle to get


1190
1:23:13,219 --> 1:23:17,889
anything done. We drove our schools to be
number one in the nation. We cut taxes 19


1191
1:23:17,889 --> 1:23:18,3
times.


1192
1:23:18,3 --> 1:23:18,929
MR. LEHRER: Well, what would you do as president?


1193
1:23:18,929 --> 1:23:23,139
MR. ROMNEY: We — as president, I will sit
down on day one — actually the day after


1194
1:23:23,139 --> 1:23:27,36
I get elected, I'll sit down with leaders
— the Democratic leaders as well as Republican


1195
1:23:27,36 --> 1:23:31,76
leaders and — as we did in my state. We
met every Monday for a couple hours, talked


1196
1:23:31,76 --> 1:23:35,59
about the issues and the challenges in the
— in the — in our state, in that case.


1197
1:23:35,59 --> 1:23:40,829
We have to work on a collaborative basis — not
because we're going to compromise our principle(s),


1198
1:23:40,829 --> 1:23:42,289
but because there's common ground.


1199
1:23:42,289 --> 1:23:46,729
And the challenges America faces right now
— look, the reason I'm in this race is there


1200
1:23:46,729 --> 1:23:50,699
are people that are really hurting today in
this country, and we face — this deficit


1201
1:23:50,699 --> 1:23:55,139
could crush the future generations. What's
happening in the Middle East? There are developments


1202
1:23:55,139 --> 1:24:2,249
around the world that are of real concern.
And Republicans and Democrats both love America,


1203
1:24:2,249 --> 1:24:6,699
but we need to have leadership — leadership
in Washington that will actually bring people


1204
1:24:6,699 --> 1:24:12,179
together and get the job done and could not
care less if it's a Republican or a Democrat.


1205
1:24:12,179 --> 1:24:14,26
I've done it before. I'll do it again.


1206
1:24:14,26 --> 1:24:15,139
MR. LEHRER: Mr. President.


1207
1:24:15,139 --> 1:24:17,579
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, first of all, I think
Governor Romney's going to have a busy first


1208
1:24:17,579 --> 1:24:21,86
day, because he's also going to repeal "Obamacare,"
which will not be very popular among Democrats


1209
1:24:21,86 --> 1:24:23,96
as you're sitting down with them.


1210
1:24:23,96 --> 1:24:25,179
(Laughter.)


1211
1:24:25,179 --> 1:24:32,92
But look, my philosophy has been I will take
ideas from anybody, Democrat or Republican,


1212
1:24:32,92 --> 1:24:36,889
as long as they're advancing the cause of
making middle-class families stronger and


1213
1:24:36,889 --> 1:24:41,1
giving ladders of opportunity into the middle
class. That's how we cut taxes for middle-class


1214
1:24:41,1 --> 1:24:44,44
families and small businesses. That's how
we cut a trillion dollars of spending that


1215
1:24:44,44 --> 1:24:49,94
wasn't advancing that cause. That's how we
signed three trade deals into law that are


1216
1:24:49,94 --> 1:24:54,469
helping us to double our exports and sell
more American products around the world. That's


1217
1:24:54,469 --> 1:24:59,249
how we repealed "don't ask, don't tell." That's
how we ended the war in Iraq, as I promised,


1218
1:24:59,249 --> 1:25:3,489
and that's how we're going to wind down the
war in Afghanistan. That's how we went after


1219
1:25:3,489 --> 1:25:5,699
al-Qaida and bin Laden.


1220
1:25:5,699 --> 1:25:12,289
So we've — we've seen progress even under
Republican control of the House or Representatives.


1221
1:25:12,289 --> 1:25:17,9
But ultimately, part of being principled,
part of being a leader is, A, being able to


1222
1:25:17,9 --> 1:25:22,989
describe exactly what it is that you intend
to do, not just saying, I'll sit down, but


1223
1:25:22,989 --> 1:25:24,969
you have to have a plan.


1224
1:25:24,969 --> 1:25:30,659
Number two, what's important is occasionally
you've got to say now to — to — to folks


1225
1:25:30,659 --> 1:25:35,55
both in your own party and in the other party.
And you know, yes, have we had some fights


1226
1:25:35,55 --> 1:25:40,449
between me and the Republicans when they fought
back against us, reining in the excesses of


1227
1:25:40,449 --> 1:25:45,179
Wall Street? Absolutely, because that was
a fight that needed to be had. When — when


1228
1:25:45,179 --> 1:25:49,3
we were fighting about whether or not we were
going to make sure that Americans had more


1229
1:25:49,3 --> 1:25:53,179
security with their health insurance and they
said no, yes, that was a fight that we needed


1230
1:25:53,179 --> 1:26:0,26
to have. And so part of leadership and governing
is both saying what it is that you are for,


1231
1:26:0,26 --> 1:26:2,559
but also being willing to say no to some things.


1232
1:26:2,559 --> 1:26:6,11
And I've got to tell you, Governor Romney,
when it comes to his own party during the


1233
1:26:6,11 --> 1:26:10,989
course of this campaign, has not displayed
that willingness to say no to some of the


1234
1:26:10,989 --> 1:26:12,84
more extreme parts of his party.


1235
1:26:12,84 --> 1:26:18,769
MR. LEHRER: That brings us to closing statements.
There was a coin toss. Governor Romney, you


1236
1:26:18,769 --> 1:26:21,21
won the toss, and you elected to go last.


1237
1:26:21,21 --> 1:26:24,53
So you have a closing two minutes, Mr. President.


1238
1:26:24,53 --> 1:26:27,599
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well, Jim, I want to thank
you and I want to thank Governor Romney, because


1239
1:26:27,599 --> 1:26:31,3
I think this was a terrific debate and I very
much appreciate it.


1240
1:26:31,3 --> 1:26:34,69
And I want to thank the University of Denver.


1241
1:26:34,69 --> 1:26:45,679
You know, four years ago we were going through
a major crisis, and yet my faith and confidence


1242
1:26:45,679 --> 1:26:52,53
in the American future is undiminished. And
the reason is because of its people. Because


1243
1:26:52,53 --> 1:26:57,219
of the woman I met in North Carolina who decided
at 55 to go back to school because she wanted


1244
1:26:57,219 --> 1:27:1,469
to inspire her daughter, and now has a new
job from that new training that she's gotten.


1245
1:27:1,469 --> 1:27:6,389
Because of the company in Minnesota who was
willing to give up salaries and perks for


1246
1:27:6,389 --> 1:27:11,79
their executives to make sure that they didn't
lay off workers during a recession. The auto


1247
1:27:11,79 --> 1:27:16,659
workers that you meet in Toledo or Detroit
take such pride in building the best cars


1248
1:27:16,659 --> 1:27:22,9
in the world — not just because of a paycheck,
but because it gives them that sense of pride,


1249
1:27:22,9 --> 1:27:24,38
that they're helping to build America.


1250
1:27:24,38 --> 1:27:27,659
And so the question now is, how do we build
on those strengths? And everything that I've


1251
1:27:27,659 --> 1:27:31,82
tried to do and everything that I'm now proposing
for the next four years in terms of improving


1252
1:27:31,82 --> 1:27:37,11
our education system, or developing American
energy, or making sure that we're closing


1253
1:27:37,11 --> 1:27:40,809
loopholes for companies that are shipping
jobs overseas and focusing on small businesses


1254
1:27:40,809 --> 1:27:44,429
and companies that are creating jobs here
in the United States, or — or closing our


1255
1:27:44,429 --> 1:27:49,34
deficit in a responsible, balanced way that
allows us to invest in our future — all


1256
1:27:49,34 --> 1:27:56,159
those things are designed to make sure that
the American people, their genius, their grit,


1257
1:27:56,159 --> 1:28:3,139
their determination is — is channeled, and
— and — and they have an opportunity to


1258
1:28:3,139 --> 1:28:3,57
succeed.


1259
1:28:3,57 --> 1:28:7,809
And everybody's getting a fair shot and everybody's
getting a fair share. Everybody's doing a


1260
1:28:7,809 --> 1:28:10,38
fair share and everybody's playing by the
same rules.


1261
1:28:10,38 --> 1:28:16,409
You know, four years ago I said that I'm not
a perfect man and I wouldn't be a perfect


1262
1:28:16,409 --> 1:28:21,21
president. And that's probably a promise that
Governor Romney thinks I've kept. But I also


1263
1:28:21,21 --> 1:28:26,21
promised that I'd fight every single day on
behalf of the American people and the middle


1264
1:28:26,21 --> 1:28:28,999
class and all those who are striving to get
in the middle class.


1265
1:28:28,999 --> 1:28:34,969
I've kept that promise and if you'll vote
for me, then I promise I'll fight just as


1266
1:28:34,969 --> 1:28:35,57
hard in a second term.


1267
1:28:35,57 --> 1:28:37,499
MR. LEHRER: Governor Romney, your two-minute
closing.


1268
1:28:37,499 --> 1:28:42,28
MR. ROMNEY: Thank you, Jim and Mr. President.
And thank you for tuning in this evening.


1269
1:28:42,28 --> 1:28:46,559
This is a — this is an important election.
And I'm concerned about America. I'm concerned


1270
1:28:46,559 --> 1:28:52,119
about the direction America has been taking
over the last four years. I know this is bigger


1271
1:28:52,119 --> 1:28:58,559
than election about the two of us as individuals.
It's bigger than our respective parties. It's


1272
1:28:58,559 --> 1:29:2,57
an election about the course of America — what
kind of America do you want to have for yourself


1273
1:29:2,57 --> 1:29:4,199
and for your children.


1274
1:29:4,199 --> 1:29:7,449
And there really are two very different paths
that we began speaking about this evening.


1275
1:29:7,449 --> 1:29:10,69
And over the course of this month we're going
to have two more presidential debates and


1276
1:29:10,69 --> 1:29:14,829
vice presidential debate. We'll talk about
those two paths. But they lead in very different


1277
1:29:14,829 --> 1:29:19,329
directions. And it's not just looking to our
words that you have to take in evidence of


1278
1:29:19,329 --> 1:29:20,849
where they go; you can look at the record.


1279
1:29:20,849 --> 1:29:24,449
There's no question in my mind that if the
president were to be re-elected you'll continue


1280
1:29:24,449 --> 1:29:29,88
to see a middle-class squeeze with incomes
going down and prices going up. I'll get incomes


1281
1:29:29,88 --> 1:29:35,39
up again. You'll see chronic unemployment.
We've had 43 straight months with unemployment


1282
1:29:35,39 --> 1:29:40,519
above 8 percent. If I'm president, I will
create — help create 12 million new jobs


1283
1:29:40,519 --> 1:29:42,78
in this country with rising incomes.


1284
1:29:42,78 --> 1:29:47,53
If the president's re-elected, "Obamacare"
will be fully installed. In my view, that's


1285
1:29:47,53 --> 1:29:51,409
going to mean a whole different way of life
for people who counted on the insurance plan


1286
1:29:51,409 --> 1:29:55,69
they had in the past. Many will lose it. You're
going to see health premiums go up by some


1287
1:29:55,69 --> 1:30:1,139
$2,500 per — per family. If I'm elected,
we won't have "Obamacare." We'll put in place


1288
1:30:1,139 --> 1:30:5,34
the kind of principles that I put in place
in my own state and allow each state to craft


1289
1:30:5,34 --> 1:30:9,479
their own programs to get people insured.
And we'll focus on getting the cost of health


1290
1:30:9,479 --> 1:30:10,889
care down.


1291
1:30:10,889 --> 1:30:16,889
If the president were to be re-elected, you're
going to see a $716 billion cut to Medicare.


1292
1:30:16,889 --> 1:30:20,479
You'll have 4 million people who will lose
Medicare advantage. You'll have hospitals


1293
1:30:20,479 --> 1:30:23,469
and providers that'll no longer accept Medicare
patients.


1294
1:30:23,469 --> 1:30:27,159
I'll restore that $716 billion to Medicare.


1295
1:30:27,159 --> 1:30:31,949
And finally, military. If the president's
re-elected, you'll see dramatic cuts to our


1296
1:30:31,949 --> 1:30:36,78
military. The secretary of defense has said
these would be even devastating. I will not


1297
1:30:36,78 --> 1:30:41,36
cut our commitment to our military. I will
keep America strong and get America's middle


1298
1:30:41,36 --> 1:30:42,869
class working again.


1299
1:30:42,869 --> 1:30:43,34
Thank you, Jim.


1300
1:30:43,34 --> 1:30:44,55
MR. LEHRER: Thank you, Governor.


1301
1:30:44,55 --> 1:30:46,3
Thank you, Mr. President.


1302
1:30:46,3 --> 1:30:51,229
The next debate will be the vice presidential
event on Thursday, October 11th at Center


1303
1:30:51,229 --> 1:30:56,199
College in Danville, Kentucky. For now, from
the University of Denver, I'm Jim Lehrer.


1304
1:30:56,199 --> 1:32:56,199
Thank you, and good night. (Cheers, applause.)
