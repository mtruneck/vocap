2
0:0:0,3 --> 0:0:3,19
We've been sending creatures up
into space for a long time.


3
0:0:3,19 --> 0:0:6,62
And tardigrades, among other
microorganisms, are special in


4
0:0:6,62 --> 0:0:8,88
that they can withstand these
extremes of temperature.


5
0:0:8,88 --> 0:0:11,21
So they decided, well, let's see
if they can withstand the


6
0:0:11,21 --> 0:0:12,52
real vacuum.


7
0:0:12,52 --> 0:0:14,89
And the perfect vacuum
is in space.


8
0:0:14,89 --> 0:0:17,55
As we send tardigrades
into space, the


9
0:0:17,55 --> 0:0:19,41
question has to arise--


10
0:0:19,41 --> 0:0:21,3
maybe tardigrades came
from space, if they


11
0:0:21,3 --> 0:0:22,55
can withstand it.

14
0:0:50,24 --> 0:0:52,0
I consider myself
a naturalist.


15
0:0:52,0 --> 0:0:56,24
I've been called a naturalist
in a classical sense, which,


16
0:0:56,24 --> 0:0:58,49
for example-- and I'm not
comparing myself-- but Charles


17
0:0:58,49 --> 0:1:0,52
Darwin was a naturalist.


18
0:1:0,52 --> 0:1:2,552
He made a contribution
to science.


19
0:1:2,552 --> 0:1:6,29
So basically, I'm just an
ordinary person, and I like


20
0:1:6,29 --> 0:1:9,445
nature, like most people do.


21
0:1:9,445 --> 0:1:12,65
And being in nature sort of
wants to make me study it a


22
0:1:12,65 --> 0:1:13,9
little bit more.


23
0:1:13,9 --> 0:1:16,13



24
0:1:16,13 --> 0:1:18,46
I wanted to make a contribution
to science--


25
0:1:18,46 --> 0:1:19,54
modestly.


26
0:1:19,54 --> 0:1:22,3
I didn't think I'd do anything
great, but something.


27
0:1:22,3 --> 0:1:24,88
Maybe something that somebody
hadn't done.


28
0:1:24,88 --> 0:1:29,5
And in just looking for various
things to do, the word


29
0:1:29,5 --> 0:1:30,44
tardigrade came up.


30
0:1:30,44 --> 0:1:32,755
Didn't even really know what
a tardigrade was till


31
0:1:32,755 --> 0:1:34,5
I looked into it.


32
0:1:34,5 --> 0:1:38,63



33
0:1:38,63 --> 0:1:41,94
So tardigrades are little
microscopic creatures.


34
0:1:41,94 --> 0:1:44,27
They're about a millimeter
or less in size.


35
0:1:44,27 --> 0:1:45,29
They're very tiny.


36
0:1:45,29 --> 0:1:48,22
Basically, it's a little
caterpillar-like creature.


37
0:1:48,22 --> 0:1:50,4
Looks like a caterpillar
with eight legs.


38
0:1:50,4 --> 0:1:52,21
And it has claws which
look like bear claws.


39
0:1:52,21 --> 0:1:54,63
That's why it's called
a water bear.


40
0:1:54,63 --> 0:1:55,66
They have a mouth.


41
0:1:55,66 --> 0:1:57,71
They have a digestive tract.


42
0:1:57,71 --> 0:1:59,17
They have muscles.


43
0:1:59,17 --> 0:2:1,13
They have a nervous system,
so they're similar


44
0:2:1,13 --> 0:2:3,42
to us in that way.


45
0:2:3,42 --> 0:2:5,3
They're like insects
in that they have


46
0:2:5,3 --> 0:2:7,37
that hard-shell skin.


47
0:2:7,37 --> 0:2:10,97
They reproduce with eggs, and
then they molt their skin and


48
0:2:10,97 --> 0:2:15,28
they use their whole body
to facilitate digestion.


49
0:2:15,28 --> 0:2:17,23
We don't really know
how they evolved.


50
0:2:17,23 --> 0:2:19,9
We can't even guess.


51
0:2:19,9 --> 0:2:22,58
We don't know what other species
they're related to,


52
0:2:22,58 --> 0:2:23,73
because they're so different.


53
0:2:23,73 --> 0:2:27,49
And of course, their ability
to withstand--


54
0:2:27,49 --> 0:2:31,38
as far as heat, they can survive
120 degrees Celsius,


55
0:2:31,38 --> 0:2:33,69
which is 240 degrees
Fahrenheit.


56
0:2:33,69 --> 0:2:37,63
200 or 300 degrees below 0,
vacuum of space, 1,000


57
0:2:37,63 --> 0:2:42,4
atmospheres of pressure, x-rays,
ultraviolet radiation.


58
0:2:42,4 --> 0:2:47,258
So tardigrades can survive
all of these extremes.


59
0:2:47,258 --> 0:2:51,1
Now, if you're looking for
tardigrades and you want to


60
0:2:51,1 --> 0:2:54,92
find a good habitat, trees like
this, which have deep


61
0:2:54,92 --> 0:2:57,315
furrows in the bark, are best.


62
0:2:57,315 --> 0:3:0,19
So tardigrades have gone into
space, where there's a perfect


63
0:3:0,19 --> 0:3:4,39
vacuum, and also there's a lot
of solar radiation and


64
0:3:4,39 --> 0:3:7,48
ultraviolet and x-ray
radiation in space.


65
0:3:7,48 --> 0:3:8,8
And it's very intense.


66
0:3:8,8 --> 0:3:11,75
It's something more than we
can create here on earth.


67
0:3:11,75 --> 0:3:13,7
So that was a great way to test
them, and they came back


68
0:3:13,7 --> 0:3:15,817
and survived.

0:3:15,817 --> 0:3:27,28
[JAZZY ELECTRONICA MUSIC]


70
0:3:27,28 --> 0:3:29,38
Did tardigrades come
from space?


71
0:3:29,38 --> 0:3:30,41
Anything is possible.


72
0:3:30,41 --> 0:3:32,28
We might have come from
another galaxy.


73
0:3:32,28 --> 0:3:36,88
The problem is distances across
space are so large, and


74
0:3:36,88 --> 0:3:39,23
even if you're traveling as fast
as anything can travel,


75
0:3:39,23 --> 0:3:42,68
which is the speed of light, it
would take hundreds, if not


76
0:3:42,68 --> 0:3:45,47
thousands, of years to
go from one galaxy or


77
0:3:45,47 --> 0:3:47,13
one planet to another.


78
0:3:47,13 --> 0:3:50,405
So in that timeframe,
anything can happen.


79
0:3:50,405 --> 0:3:53,6
You can't colonize
planets that way.


80
0:3:53,6 --> 0:3:55,76
Not now-- not as
far as we know.


81
0:3:55,76 --> 0:3:58,2
So the answer right now is,
anything is possible.


82
0:3:58,2 --> 0:4:0,71
I don't have a personal
theory about it.


83
0:4:0,71 --> 0:4:3,33
Do I believe in extraterrestrial
life--


84
0:4:3,33 --> 0:4:5,2
that life exist outside
this planet?


85
0:4:5,2 --> 0:4:6,76
Yeah, I do believe that.


86
0:4:6,76 --> 0:4:9,59
Just because I believe in
odds and possibilities.


87
0:4:9,59 --> 0:4:11,34
And because the universe
is infinite.


88
0:4:11,34 --> 0:4:13,88
If you can just grasp that,
which is hard enough to do.


89
0:4:13,88 --> 0:4:17,5



90
0:4:17,5 --> 0:4:19,88
There might be other forms of
life right under our noses,


91
0:4:19,88 --> 0:4:22,99
such as tardigrades, which are
right here, which did come


92
0:4:22,99 --> 0:4:23,77
from other planets.


93
0:4:23,77 --> 0:4:25,98
We don't know that, though.


94
0:4:25,98 --> 0:4:28,51
When I did a little research
on it, I found out there


95
0:4:28,51 --> 0:4:32,42
wasn't really that much known
about tardigrades.


96
0:4:32,42 --> 0:4:37,12
In fact, I read one scientific
paper and found that New


97
0:4:37,12 --> 0:4:40,17
Jersey, the state I was living
at the time, had zero


98
0:4:40,17 --> 0:4:42,36
tardigrades showing
on the map.


99
0:4:42,36 --> 0:4:44,58
So I said, well, let's see
if I can a tardigrade.


100
0:4:44,58 --> 0:4:47,84



101
0:4:47,84 --> 0:4:51,77
I visited all 21 counties in
New Jersey and found that


102
0:4:51,77 --> 0:4:54,8
tardigrades are ubiquitous,
which means they're


103
0:4:54,8 --> 0:4:55,23
everywhere.


104
0:4:55,23 --> 0:4:59,72
So I wrote a scientific paper,
found various species, took


105
0:4:59,72 --> 0:5:2,7
photographs, identified
the trees--


106
0:5:2,7 --> 0:5:3,41
their habitat.


107
0:5:3,41 --> 0:5:5,86
And that paper will
be published soon.


108
0:5:5,86 --> 0:5:8,86
It's being reviewed now by
one of the prominent


109
0:5:8,86 --> 0:5:10,71
tardigradologists.


110
0:5:10,71 --> 0:5:14,97
And perhaps have even found a
new species of tardigrade, so


111
0:5:14,97 --> 0:5:16,19
that's under review now.


112
0:5:16,19 --> 0:5:19,4
I've sent my slides
off for analysis.


113
0:5:19,4 --> 0:5:21,14
Now, wait a second.


114
0:5:21,14 --> 0:5:23,87
This could also be a good
tardigrade habitat.


115
0:5:23,87 --> 0:5:25,99
This is just ordinary moss.


116
0:5:25,99 --> 0:5:31,52
You just take a piece of moss
out and place it into a coin


117
0:5:31,52 --> 0:5:34,8
envelope or a paper bag.


118
0:5:34,8 --> 0:5:37,47
And what you'll find is, even
though it's dry right now,


119
0:5:37,47 --> 0:5:40,74
once you rehydrate it,
tardigrades will appear.


120
0:5:40,74 --> 0:5:43,9
So we're going to place this
moss into the envelope.


121
0:5:43,9 --> 0:5:48,1
How do tardigrades go into
what's called cryptobiosis or


122
0:5:48,1 --> 0:5:49,47
suspended animation?


123
0:5:49,47 --> 0:5:51,2
I mean, that's pretty
fascinating.


124
0:5:51,2 --> 0:5:53,14
They just curl up into
a little ball.


125
0:5:53,14 --> 0:5:56,66
They create a very hard shell,
and somehow, some way, within,


126
0:5:56,66 --> 0:6:0,31
there's a seed of moisture,
a molecule of water, that


127
0:6:0,31 --> 0:6:2,54
preserves them inside
this encrustment.


128
0:6:2,54 --> 0:6:5,77
The lifespan of a tardigrade,
if it was just moving around


129
0:6:5,77 --> 0:6:7,85
in the water and you were
observing it, might be the


130
0:6:7,85 --> 0:6:8,73
only 6 months.


131
0:6:8,73 --> 0:6:11,68
But because it dries out,
rehydrates, dries out,


132
0:6:11,68 --> 0:6:13,62
rehydrates, dries out,
rehydrates--


133
0:6:13,62 --> 0:6:16,82
this could be done over a period
of many, many years.


134
0:6:16,82 --> 0:6:18,89
This is how they preserve
themselves.


135
0:6:18,89 --> 0:6:21,608
Sometimes, they can be 100
years old that way.
