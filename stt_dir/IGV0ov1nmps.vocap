###1 BEN EBBRELL: Hey.
###1 We're SORTEDFood.
###2 And today, we're here to show you a YouTube Crush cocktail.
###5 BARRY TAYLOR: This is our pomegranate kiss.
###7 BEN EBBRELL: And it needs to start off with a loving kiss.
###8 MIKE HUTTLESTONE: OK.
###9 I've got this covered.
###9 BARRY TAYLOR: Oh, god.
###10 MIKE HUTTLESTONE: You carry on.
###11 BEN EBBRELL: So here, we've got 3/4 bottle
###13 of pomegranate juice.
###14 Reduce down in a pan with a couple of tablespoons of sugar
###18 until it becomes really, really syrupy and sweet.
###21 BARRY TAYLOR: Mike, have you done this before?
###23 BEN EBBRELL: Apply and smear.
###26 MIKE HUTTLESTONE: There you go.
###28 Not bad.
###28 BEN EBBRELL: Job done.
###29 Now, for the actual cocktail-- I'll leave that to one side.
###32 Baz, 50-50 pomegranate juice.
###35 Why?
###36 Because it's tropical and every Valentine's drink
###38 needs to be pink-- so 50-50.
###39 BARRY TAYLOR: Of course, it has to be.
###41 How much?
###42 BEN EBBRELL: 50-50, so that's fine.
###43 Equal measure of ginger ale, and that's
###45 there for the fiery kick.
###47 MIKE HUTTLESTONE: Yeah.
###47 Fiery passion-- also important to a relationship.
###49 BARRY TAYLOR: What are you getting at, Mike?
###50 MIKE HUTTLESTONE: I'm talking like I'm an expert.
###51 [LAUGHTER]
###52 BEN EBBRELL: It's all about balancing flavors.
###54 There we go.
###56 And then perhaps a little bit of a cliche,
###59 but we've got to pop a cork.
###62 There we go.
###63 MIKE HUTTLESTONE: Don't aim it towards me.
###63 BARRY TAYLOR: [INAUDIBLE] impress the date by--
###66 BEN EBBRELL: And we've crushed up some ice.
###69 Our ginger and pomegranate in over the ice.
###72 BARRY TAYLOR: Look how pretty that is.
###73 MIKE HUTTLESTONE: Mm-hmm.
###74 BEN EBBRELL: And then finish it with the fizz.
###76 BARRY TAYLOR: Ben, did you make this one for yourself
###77 rather than your date?
###78 MIKE HUTTLESTONE: This is what he's
###79 going to be drinking by himself on Valentine's night.
###82 BEN EBBRELL: Beautiful.
###83 Every Valentine loves a perfume fragrance.
###86 BARRY TAYLOR: Indeed.
###87 BEN EBBRELL: So here, we've got some basil.
###88 It might sound weird.
###89 MIKE HUTTLESTONE: Yeah.
###90 BARRY TAYLOR: A little bit.
###90 BEN EBBRELL: So basil with ginger, absolutely beautiful.
###93 That can go in there.
###94 Top it right up now those bubbles have died.
###96 BARRY TAYLOR: Be generous.
###99 BEN EBBRELL: And finish it with a pincher
###102 berry, or a physalis fruit.
###103 And that just sits on top of there.
###106 MIKE HUTTLESTONE: Nice.
###107 BEN EBBRELL: Basil, pincher berry, pomegranate, ginger,
###111 champagne-- that's our YouTube Crush
###114 cocktail for your Valentine sorted.
###118 BARRY TAYLOR: Look.
###119 How easy is that?
###120 MIKE HUTTLESTONE: But if you missed any of it,
###121 you can check out the full recipe in the description box
###124 below.
###124 BEN EBBRELL: Here.
