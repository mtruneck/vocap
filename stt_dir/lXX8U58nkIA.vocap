###2 and if behavior were fixed, we'd still be living in caves. We couldn't learn how to
###6 drive a car. We couldn't alter our patterns. Fortunately, people grow up, get old and die
###19 and that gives the new generation a chance for newer responses to the environment. By
###26 responses, I mean reactions. All you get in the environment is a reaction. If you've been
###32 brought up as a baby, with bears an lions all tame and you go into the woods you'd be
###41 torn to pieces, if you use that reaction system. If you're brought up with wolves and lions
###48 and elephants all tamed and you walk into the jungle you won't live very long, with
###54 that attitude. But no one can know except the reaction they get. Is that clear? I was
###63 told that a rattle snake has rattles on it's tail, and they move to warn you. They don't
###70 move to warn you, they move period. A rattle snake doesn't know to warn you he's going
###77 to bite, that is his reaction to you and it makes noise. All snakes tails move, did you
###83 know that? When they see people whether the rattle is there or not. The normal person
###91 projects - the rattles are there to warn you, or an animal looks hideous or has patterns
###97 that look like eyes to scare you. There is some animals that have circles on the back
###103 of the head and they say the purpose of that is so that if something approaches from the
###108 rear, they'll think it is eyes - they don't think about those things. Knowing the difference
###117 between human project and human reactions. That is why love would be impossible - the
###127 actions that generate love 200 years ago are not the same as they are today. So a person
###134 says do you think there is enough love in the world? I don't know what they're talking
###139 about and I don't think they know. If they say "do you feel that people are being oriented
###146 to their environment" - I know what they're talking about. But if they say "do you think
###151 love will prevail?" - I don't think they know what they're talking about. Love-do they mean
###157 extending maximum courtesy to people regardless of the person? Well that would be ridiculous.
###165 You can't have a word like love without defining what you mean by it. If by love you mean greeting
###176 everyone fairly and then doing a survey asking how you can relate to that person. After that
###184 survey you say I might be able to relate to them in 3 months if they listen - you don't
###191 know that, so you try. You, what you do is manipulate variables in languages and the
###200 environment, if it works you take it on, if it doesn't work you can easily get mad at
###207 the person depending on your reaction, or you can say the person doesn't have enough
###212 to close that to understand what I'm talking about. When a child says "I love my mommy"
###221  - if mommy - if the child knows that mommy feeds her, washes her, prevents her from when
###227 she gets injuries, takes care of her, she associates love with moms devotion to her
###234 needs. When a guy says to a girl "I love you" she says "what have you done to prove that?"
###241 She doesn't say that. How do you manifest that? When a guy says to a girl, "I love you
###250 very much, more than anything in the world, more than my life itself" the girl might be
###256 flattered, but he said nothing. Now, if a person says "how can I meet your needs?" Well,
###265 if he is a nazi you say "go out and kill some jews!" You'd be meeting his needs. But is
###273 meeting another persons needs love? Not necessarily. Love is not only meeting their needs but giving
###281 them tools to fulfill their needs. Do you know what that means? Like you - prepare that
###287 drink because you feel it is nourishing, more nourishing than other systems. Ok, now if
###294 a person drinks that and has a very negative attitude that will not nourish a person. Now
###301 let me tell you again. If you're born with a good brain, high quality tissue, all the
###310 neurons in place, everything there, good, it has no mechanism remember for knowing that
###318 which is relevant. The brain doesn't know anything until it experiences something, like
###323 a certain bird with checkerboard pattern, when it lands on you, then it pecks at your
###330 skin and hurts you, then you stay away from birds with checkerboard pattern, but you can't
###337 inherit that knowledge, like look at the bird and stay away from it without experience.
###345 You can't walk a tight rope unless you get on something and try to balance yourself,
###350 over a long period of time. If you use a long bamboo pole, there is a thing called inertia,
###356 the bamboo pole doesn't flex as fast as you do, so you can do this and maintain stability
###363 with a long pole, and then you can shorten the pole and that'll give you more and more
###370 experience in balancing. There is some people who learn to balance faster than others, that
###376 is the structure of the semicircular canal of the ear, and physical structure can give
###382 you a propensity toward learning to balance a little faster than the other guy, I don't
###388 know if you understand that. Propensity means, if you have 2 normal eyes, 1 has half the
###396 quality of the vision of the other you become asymmetric, you know what I mean? If they're
###407 symmetric you stand a better chance. If the brain is clean, meaning has no toxins in it,
###409 your response to the environment will not be based on the cleanliness of the brain but
###415 the tribe you're brought up with. If they say Moses is angry or Loeb did this, or that,
###423 that is using the brain well, if it corresponds to the environment, but you can't study anything
###430 apart from the environment. Can you understand that? Any problem with that? If you say "use
###442 your head" a person - you're telling them to use tools they don't have, is what you're
###447 saying "use your head! Think about it!" well that doesn't tell them anything, unless you
###453 give them tools, they don't know what tools are, so you have to show them what tools are.
###460 Somebody wanted a bullet once that travels around a corner, when you fire a gun it'd
###469 go round the corner, so he shaved one end of the bullet so it was asymmetric instead
###480 of even 1 side was shaved, so the wind turned the bullet around, if the gun - if it didn't
###483 rotate. Do you understand? If the bullet rotates that doesn't do that. So an inventive mind
###490 is not an inborn process it's a person with a hell of a lot of tools, that ask questions
###500 that are relevant. How can I make a bullet turn? I don't know. If you're boat is asymmetric,
###508 not uniform, oddly shaped, point to 1 side it'll go round in circles if you make a boat
###516 like that. Do you understand? How big should a rudder be on an airplane? Nobody knows
###521 - they build an airplane and the rudder is too small, and it doesn't work too well, so
###527 they make it larger, sometimes they make it too large. Just finding the right size meaning
###534 the best size for that plane is called research  - "I don't know". A person that doesn't know
###542 anything would be a metaphysician because they make assumptions. It's alright to make
###550 assumptions as long as you're - "these are my assumptions" or "I'm speculating". Now
###556 there are scientists that are trying to find out - "what is the universe?" Is the universe
###564 saying - I was reading that guy - what's his name?
###571 - [UNKNOWN]
###571 - Kurz? - Kurzweil?
###573 He gets off in the middle of the book, and he says "does the universe - is the universe
###579 intelligent?" Now what the hell does that mean? - Is the universe intelligent? - He's
###585 trying to say that the universe may have a built in program to evolve - he may be saying
###592 that. But if planets explode, and they're all different distances, and they wobble,
###597 I don't know what he means by "does evolution have an end goal?" Even if evolution did,
###606 say evolution makes a man more neural associations, it has nothing to do with real value, because
###614 it only has to do with that organism, do you know that means? If your brain evolved and
###620 your eyes become more efficient, in relation to what? So how can you say the universe is
###629 evolving or becoming intelligent, except in relation to something. If you don't know what
###636 that means, if the universe suddenly said the sun is too bright we don't need that much
###641 sunlight for the amount of trees on earth, and the sun dimmed down, cause it doesn't
###647 need all that burst of light. Then you can say the conservation of energy seems to be
###656 built in, in some areas it does exist and other areas it does not exist. They say the
###663 earth when it spins, wobbles a little, wobbles meaning doing that, and some day it'll wobble
###672 more than others, so, is there a purpose to the wobble? No but there's a cause to the
###680 wobble, not a purpose, always a cause to the wobble. You know what that means? They say
###687 that planets explode- well, if you live 1 billionth of a second no planet ever explodes,
###698 do you know what that means? The higher you go on an airplane, waves move, the higher
###704 you go, the smaller they become and more still it appears, you can't see waves 6 miles up,
###712 all you can see is patterns in the ocean that look frozen, the closer you get, the more
###719 fluid. So, what is the true nature of things? That's not the question. "What is your response
###727 to nature?" Is the question. Do you know what that means? What is your range of response
###735 to nature? You can't see a bacteria wagging it's little tail, so all your books on life
###741 have to do with your receptors, not what's around you. If you wrote you wrote a book
###748 on the absolute truth, it'd be a ridiculous book because absolute truth freezes things
###755  - "this is the truth - waves don't move they're stationary" - well from high altitude - yes.
###762 If you lived 1 billionth of a second lighting would be fixed, like a photograph, you wouldn't
###768 see it go down, so you can see your experience change. They say that - I don't know how true
###779 it is but - certain types of insects see better than we do, they can see a grain of sand fall,
###788 we don't. We just see it impact. There - probably a magnetometer can sense radio waves
###797  - we can't. So, man builds instruments if he wants to know those things. But the primitive
###806 man just looks at the world and grins, he doesn't look at an airplane and say "how does
###815 that damn thing fly?" he has no curiosity except he'll look at it - with his primitive
###823 tools, but he can't say "they've really advanced that, the people who made that - they have
###828 an advanced way of thinking" - you understand? He can't say that. Now you might see a person
###836 brought up in this culture, going to church on Sunday, they're just as primitive as the
###842 head-hunters of the Amazon. Do you understand that? Alright, I also mentioned many times
###850 that Indians take turkey feathers or big feathers and make a hat, and if you point it out, the
###858 dancing around the fire with that hat does absolutely nothing, they do not remove the
###864 hat and say "thank you for being so extensional". Do you understand that? Ok, are they bad?
###873 No - are they mean? No, they're riding existing paths. Their brain has a road right through
###879 it as rigid as any other road and they're riding that path. That's why when a person
###888 says "let's be reasonable", they're trying to superimpose experience with three words
###895 "let's be reasonable" - you can be reasonable, you can learn to be reasonable - more so.
###902 Do you know what that means? Or "may I have your attention?" you can only have the attention
###909 they can give you, do you know what that means? When an officer walks into an army tent they
###915 say "attention!" meaning he's about to say something, which you have to listen for "all
###920 you guys ought a be at point A at 4 o'clock" well that's behavioral manipulation with few
###928 words - Yes?
