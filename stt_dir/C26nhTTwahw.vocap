###16 In Japan, it's pretty common when the customers come into
###19 the restaurant [JAPANESE].
###21 Something like that.
###22 But I want to give the customer a good impression, so
###27 we just sing that only one time together.
###31 [SINGING IN JAPANESE]
###37 MASARU OGASAWARA: It means "Welcome to our restaurant."
###41 Some people hate greetings because it's so noisy, loud.
###45 But it's pretty important.
###47 When I come to Toronto, I'm not sure about that we are
###49 being so successful.
###51 So at the beginning, I really want to say, thank you so much
###55 for coming to this small restaurant.
###58 I love greetings.
###59 I love the shouting.
###60 It's totally different from the other Japanese
###62 restaurants.
###63 It's our style.
###64 It's Guu style.
###65 It's my style.
###67 
###82 Hi.
###82 This is Masaru Ogasawara.
###83 I'm a operational manager at the Guu Toronto.
###87 And kind of the executive chef too.
###90 I don't eat sushi every single day.
###93 But I can go to Izakaya every single day.
###97 Izakaya is the Japanese style pubs.
###100 Every Japanese people, after work, they go to the Izakaya
###104 and having the beer.
###108 Izakaya is the not so high-end dining restaurant.
###111 We don't serve any sushi.
###113 But our tapas dishes is pretty good.
###117 Our price is a pretty low, but some Japanese restaurants
###121 overprice the dishes, is so we are pretty honest
###123 to serving our food.
###127 I'm proud to be Japanese, so I want to serve the real taste
###132 Japanese dish for Torontonians.
###134 We serve a lot of dishes.
###135 So something, they don't like it.
###138 Something, they love it.
###140 So I think it's a good experience for Izakaya dining.
###142 -[SPEAKING JAPANESE]
###145 -Nice order.
###147 MASARU OGASAWARA: At our restaurant, Kakimayo is that
###149 most popular dish.
###151 Kakimayo is the baked Pacific oyster with white sauce,
###157 spinach, mayo, with cheese on the top too.
###160 I serve the Kakimayo on their shells.
###163 Customers see those.
###164 They like our presentation.
###165 Everybody order the dishes.
###167 Ikapiri is the deep fried squid legs with spicy ketchup
###173 sauce, with some hint of deep friend garlic tips.
###176 We just deep fry slightly and we toss the [INAUDIBLE]
###181 like a spicy ketchup.
###182 [INAUDIBLE]
###182 dishes [INAUDIBLE]
###184 
###186 popular food.
###186 Yeah.
###187 I'm pretty proud of it.

###191 [JAPANESE].
###192 [CHEERING]
###194 MASARU OGASAWARA: I went out with
###195 Natsuhiko, Kenta, and Yumeho.
###198 Kenta has been working together for three lives.
###200 He's a nice manager.
###202 Natsuhiko, I was working with him almost seven years.
###205 He's my best friend.
###206 And Yumeho is the administrator.
###208 We are working with [INAUDIBLE].
###210 They are my friends.
###212 Kind of my family.

###215 Let's go to get spaghetti now, OK?
###217 -OK.
###218 MASARU OGASAWARA: Yeah.
###218 Let's go to Enoteca.
###220 Enoteca sociale.
###221 [SPEAKING JAPANESE]
###224 [CHEERING]
###228 NATSUHIKO: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]
###230 
###232 KENTA: Yeah.
###233 MASARU OGASAWARA: Actually, my dad used to own the Italian
###235 restaurant in Japan.
###236 Japanese Italian food is pretty good.
###238 So, yeah.
###239 Sometimes better than authentic
###240 Italian food, I guess.
###242 Yeah.
###243 KENTA: [SPEAKING JAPANESE]
###245 MASARU OGASAWARA: Here, you go, sir.
###246 KENTA: Thank you, sir.
###247 MASARU OGASAWARA: Here you go, lady.
###248 Here you go, gentleman.
###250 
###253 CHRIS JACKSON: How are you guys doing?
###254 Come on in.
###254 Chris.
###255 Great to see you guys again.
###256 
###259 LUCA GATTI: Hi, I'm Luca from Enoteca Sociale.
###264 And we're just about to cook the crew from Guu some bites.
###267 You guys like everything?
###269 Perfect.
###270 We'll feed you all night.
###271 MASARU OGASAWARA: I need a beer.
###273 You need a beer too?
###275 LUCA GATTI: The cuisine in this restaurant is Roman food
###279 with a little Toronto flair.
###281 What we do differently from a lot of Italian restaurants in
###283 the city is we use not very many
###285 ingredients in our dishes.
###287 But the little ingredients that we do use, we treat them
###289 with extreme care so they all stand out quite nice.
###293 Treating the ingredients very simply can be a challenge,
###296 because you can't really hide behind certain spices and
###299 certain flavors.
###299 You have to make sure the ingredients that you source
###302 are the best ingredients as possible.
###304 
###306 We're lucky here in Ontario.
###308 We have some great local farmers
###310 that do amazing things.
###312 So I always make sure to support the local farmers that
###314 are willing to go out of their way and
###315 grow an amazing product.
###317 All right.
###318 Main course time.
###318 The main purpose of this dish is to have a
###321 lot of fun with it.
###322 The chicken is completely deboned except for the wings.
###325 This way, it's super easy for the customers to
###328 tear right into it.
###330 Just finish it with a knife directly in the middle of it,
###332 and she's done.
###335 -[SPEAKING JAPANESE]
###337 KENTA: Wow, it's so crispy.
###339 MASARU OGASAWARA: Oh.
###340 ALL: Wow.
###343 MASARU OGASAWARA: So good.
