1
0:0:0,8 --> 0:0:3,179
PROFESSOR: SO IT'S MY PLEASURE TO WELCOME
ALL OF YOU TO THIS


2
0:0:3,179 --> 0:0:7,62
LAST PART OF BIO 1B. MY NAME IS BRUCE BALDWIN
AND I'LL BE THE


3
0:0:7,62 --> 0:0:12,67
INSTRUCTOR FOR THE LAST PART OF THE COURSE.
AND MY OFFICE HOURS


4
0:0:12,67 --> 0:0:15,99
ARE GOING TO BE HELD RIGHT AFTER LECTURE ON
MONDAY, WEDNESDAY AND


5
0:0:15,99 --> 0:0:21,5
FRIDAY OVER IN THE BIO 1B AREA WHERE JOHN
HUELSENBECK HELD HIS,


6
0:0:21,5 --> 0:0:25,64
SO JUST OUTSIDE OF MIKE MOSER'S OFFICE, OVER
AT 263 ON THE NORTH


7
0:0:25,64 --> 0:0:30,57
WING OF THE BUILDING HERE ON THIS FLOOR. IF
YOU CAN'T MAKE THOSE


8
0:0:30,57 --> 0:0:34,36
OFFICE HOURS, JUST REACH ME AT THAT E-MAIL
ADDRESS,


9
0:0:34,36 --> 0:0:42,83
BBALDWIN@BERKELEY.EDU AND I'LL GET BACK TO
YOU AS SOON AS I CAN.


10
0:0:42,83 --> 0:0:46,1
THE WAY WE'RE GOING TO OPERATE THIS PART OF
THE SEMESTER I THINK


11
0:0:46,1 --> 0:0:50,53
IS PRETTY MUCH THE WAY THAT JOHN AND ALLEN
DID WHICH IS THAT I'LL


12
0:0:50,53 --> 0:0:54,64
GIVE MY LECTURES AND AFTER I'VE GIVEN THE
LECTURE, I'LL POST A


13
0:0:54,64 --> 0:1:1,17
PDF ON BSPACE OF THIS, OF THE LECTURES SLIDES.
AND IF YOU GO TO


14
0:1:1,17 --> 0:1:4,62
THE 1B SITE, YOU CAN FIND MY SYLLABUS ALREADY
POSTED WITH THE


15
0:1:4,62 --> 0:1:10,75
READINGS THERE AND THE ROUGH TOPICS FOR THE
REST OF THE SEMESTER


16
0:1:10,75 --> 0:1:16,4
INDICATED. BUT THE EXAMS' GOING TO BE ON THE
LECTURE MATERIAL.


17
0:1:16,4 --> 0:1:19,57
AND, OF COURSE, THE LECTURES ARE BEING VIDEO
CAST HERE AS WELL.


18
0:1:19,57 --> 0:1:25,18
BUT I REALLY HIGHLY RECOMMEND YOU TO READ
THE READINGS TO GET A


19
0:1:25,18 --> 0:1:29,18
LITTLE MORE CONTEXT AND FILL IN A LOT OF,
A LOT MORE DETAIL ABOUT


20
0:1:29,18 --> 0:1:33,11
THE TOPICS I'M GOING TO GO OVER BECAUSE THE
BOOK IS ACTUALLY IS


21
0:1:33,11 --> 0:1:36,28
EXCELLENT. I WAS REALLY SURPRISED TO SEE HOW
GOOD IT IS FOR THE


22
0:1:36,28 --> 0:1:39,83
BOTANY PART OF THE COURSE. SO I HIGHLY RECOMMEND
YOU DO READ


23
0:1:39,83 --> 0:1:44,92
THOSE READINGS. THOUGH I'M JUST CURIOUS HERE,
HOW MANY OF YOU


24
0:1:44,92 --> 0:1:48,84
HAVE EVERY HAD EXPOSURE TO PLANT AND FUNGAL
DIVERSITY SAY IN HIGH


25
0:1:48,84 --> 0:1:48,84



26
0:1:48,84 --> 0:1:53,56
SCHOOL BIOLOGY? CAN YOU RAISE YOUR HANDS IF
YOU HAVE. ACTUALLY


27
0:1:53,56 --> 0:1:58,83
MORE THAN I GUESSED. THIS IS OFTEN AN OVERLOOKED
TOPIC, AND,


28
0:1:58,83 --> 0:2:2,1
BUT IT'S ACTUALLY CENTRAL TO BIOLOGY, THOUGH
MANY STUDENTS FEEL


29
0:2:2,1 --> 0:2:5,58
LIKE THIS IS JUST SOMETHING THEY HAVE TO GET
THROUGH. BUT, YOU


30
0:2:5,58 --> 0:2:8,869
KNOW, PLANTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR OXYGENATED
ATMOSPHERE, FOR


31
0:2:8,869 --> 0:2:13,17
OUR OZONE LAYER THAT PROTECTS US FROM UV RADIATION,
FOR


32
0:2:13,17 --> 0:2:16,12
ESSENTIALLY ALL OF OUR FOOD, AND ACTUALLY
THE BULK OF OUR


33
0:2:16,12 --> 0:2:21,17
MEDICINES, PHARMACEUTICALS, WHICH ARE EITHER
BASED DIRECTLY ON


34
0:2:21,17 --> 0:2:25,87
PLANT PRODUCTS OR BOTANICAL PRODUCTS OR IN
MANY CASES WERE


35
0:2:25,87 --> 0:2:28,97
INSPIRED BY THOSE PRODUCTS. AND IF YOU'RE
INTERESTED IN


36
0:2:28,97 --> 0:2:32,37
LEARNING MORE ABOUT THAT, THERE'S AN EXCELLENT
COURSE IN MEDICAL


37
0:2:32,37 --> 0:2:37,73
ETHNOBOTANY, IB 117 THAT TOM CARLSON TEACHES
HERE IN FALL AND


38
0:2:37,73 --> 0:2:42,34
SUMMER SESSIONS THAT HAS BEEN REALLY VALUABLE
TO A LOT OF


39
0:2:42,34 --> 0:2:49,319
ASPIRING PHYSICIANS, MEDICAL TYPES. AND IT
MIGHT BE INTERESTING


40
0:2:49,319 --> 0:2:54,849
TO KNOW FOR YOU THAT BACK IN THE 1700S, 1800S,
THAT ANY


41
0:2:54,849 --> 0:2:58,209
SELF-RESPECTING PHYSICIAN WOULD ALSO BE AT
LEAST AT SOME LEVEL A


42
0:2:58,209 --> 0:3:1,62
BOTANIST. AND THE PEOPLE THAT REALLY LEAD
TO THE CREATION OF


43
0:3:1,62 --> 0:3:6,52
BOTANY AS A FIELD WERE PHYSICIANS. MDS WERE
SOME OF THE FIRST


44
0:3:6,52 --> 0:3:10,98
REALLY MAJOR CONTRIBUTORS. SO THE RELEVANCE
OF THIS TO BIOLOGY


45
0:3:10,98 --> 0:3:14,53
AND MEDICINE IS REALLY IMPORTANT. AND I HOPE
THAT BECOMES MORE


46
0:3:14,53 --> 0:3:20,67
CLEAR AS WE GO ALONG. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS
ABOUT THE OVERALL


47
0:3:20,67 --> 0:3:24,56
SORT OF WAY WE'RE GOING TO PROCEED HERE? YEAH?


48
0:3:24,56 --> 0:3:27,44
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]


49
0:3:27,44 --> 0:3:34,22
PROFESSOR: YEAH. THE LECTURE MATERIAL ONLY.
BUT THE READINGS


50
0:3:34,22 --> 0:3:36,94
SUPPLEMENT THE LECTURE, YOU KNOW, GIVE YOU
A LITTLE MORE CONTEXT.


51
0:3:36,94 --> 0:3:37,69



52
0:3:37,69 --> 0:3:40,629
FILL, FLUSH IT OUT A BIT BETTER FOR YOU. SO
I HIGHLY RECOMMEND


53
0:3:40,629 --> 0:3:46,64
THAT.


54
0:3:46,64 --> 0:3:48,739
SO TODAY WHAT I'M GOING TO DO IS JUST BASICALLY
GIVE YOU


55
0:3:48,739 --> 0:3:51,68
AN INTRODUCTION TO WHAT ARE PLANTS. THAT MY
SEEM LIKE AN


56
0:3:51,68 --> 0:3:55,75
ABSOLUTELY RIDICULOUSLY SIMPLE QUESTION, BUT
IT'S NOT REALLY.


57
0:3:55,75 --> 0:3:59,22
AND THEN TO, WE'RE GOING START RIGHT IN TO
LOOKING AT SOME OF THE


58
0:3:59,22 --> 0:4:3,51
COOLEST OF THE BOTANICAL ORGANISMS IN THE
BROAD SENSE, THE FUNGI,


59
0:4:3,51 --> 0:4:7,23
SOME OF THEIR IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTICS, AND
THE MAJOR GROUPS OF


60
0:4:7,23 --> 0:4:13,66
WHICH THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF ADVANCES IN RECENT
YEARS. SO WHAT


61
0:4:13,66 --> 0:4:18,449
WE CALL PLANTS AND WHAT REALLY KIND OF DICTATES
THE, THE OVERALL


62
0:4:18,449 --> 0:4:21,439
SUBJECT MATTER FOR THIS PART OF THE COURSE
REALLY GOES ALL THE


63
0:4:21,439 --> 0:4:26,589
BACK TO ARISTOTLE, TO THE ANCIENT GREEKS.
ARISTOTLE CONCERNED


64
0:4:26,589 --> 0:4:31,5
HIMSELF WITH WHAT ANIMALS WERE, AND BASICALLY
DEFINED ANIMALS AS


65
0:4:31,5 --> 0:4:35,74
GROUPS, I'M PARAPHRASING HERE, BUT MORE OR
LESS ORGANISMS WITH


66
0:4:35,74 --> 0:4:42,65
SENSORY AND PERCEPTIVE CAPABILITIES THAT COULD
MOVE FREELY ABOUT,


67
0:4:42,65 --> 0:4:47,949
COULD EXPERIENCE PAIN AND PLEASURE, FEAR,
COULD RESPOND QUICKLY


68
0:4:47,949 --> 0:4:52,199
TO STIMULI, THAT SORT OF THING. THOSE WERE
THE ANIMALS. THE


69
0:4:52,199 --> 0:4:56,49
PLANTS ARE EVERYTHING ELSE, OKAY, THE RESIDUUM.
THE THINGS THAT


70
0:4:56,49 --> 0:5:1,189
ALSO SHARE WITH THE ANIMALS IS ABILITY TO
NURSE THEMSELVES, TAKE


71
0:5:1,189 --> 0:5:5,319
CARE OF THEMSELVES, REPRODUCE BUT DON'T REALLY
HAVE ANYTHING


72
0:5:5,319 --> 0:5:8,379
GOING ON UP HERE. YOU KNOW, THEY'RE PRETTY
MUCH DEVOID OF


73
0:5:8,379 --> 0:5:12,869
SENSORY AND PERCEPTIVE CAPABILITIES. AND THIS
WAS MORE OR LESS


74
0:5:12,869 --> 0:5:17,529
ENSHRINED IN THE TAXONOMY BY LINNAEUS WHO'S
BEEN CONSIDERED THE


75
0:5:17,529 --> 0:5:22,229
FATHER OF TAXONOMY. HE WAS ACTUALLY A PHYSICIAN
AS I WAS JUST


76
0:5:22,229 --> 0:5:26,729
MENTIONING. ALSO A BOTANIST AND A ZOOLOGIST.
AND HE CAME UP


77
0:5:26,729 --> 0:5:30,409
WITH THREE MAJOR KINGDOMS OF EXISTENCE, FORMAL
TAXA. ONE OF


78
0:5:30,409 --> 0:5:30,409



79
0:5:30,409 --> 0:5:33,289
THEM WAS THE MINERAL KINGDOM, WHICH IS THE
NON-LIVING KINGDOM.


80
0:5:33,289 --> 0:5:37,74
AND WE'LL LEAVE THAT TO THE GEOLOGISTS AND
SUCH. BUT ALSO THE


81
0:5:37,74 --> 0:5:43,36
ANIMALS AND THE PLANTS. SO THAT VIEW CAME
ABOUT -- LINNAEUS


82
0:5:43,36 --> 0:5:48,58
THAT'S ABOUT THE MID 1700S -- BUT WE HAVE
THIS VIEW OF ANIMALS AS


83
0:5:48,58 --> 0:5:51,36
THINGS THAT CAN MOVE ABOUT, HAVE SENSORY AND
PERCEPTIVE


84
0:5:51,36 --> 0:5:55,889
CAPABILITY. THE NAME ANIMAL, THE ETYMOLOGY
LITERALLY MEANS SOUL,


85
0:5:55,889 --> 0:5:58,819
SO THINGS WITH A SOUL. WHEREAS PLANTS DON'T
HAVE A SOUL.


86
0:5:58,819 --> 0:6:2,659
THEY'RE, ZOOLOGY IS SCIENCE FOCUSED ON ANIMALS.
PLANTS ARE


87
0:6:2,659 --> 0:6:6,249
BASICALLY EVERYTHING ELSE AS I JUST MENTIONED.
AND BOTANY IS THE


88
0:6:6,249 --> 0:6:10,71
SCIENCE FOCUSED ON EVERYTHING BUT ANIMALS.
SO BOTANY HAS REALLY


89
0:6:10,71 --> 0:6:18,36
HAD A HUGE SCOPE OF FOCUS ORGANISMALLY THROUGHOUT
HISTORY. AND


90
0:6:18,36 --> 0:6:23,21
IT WASN'T UNTIL ABOUT THE LATE 1960S, A LITTLE
OVER 40 YEARS AGO


91
0:6:23,21 --> 0:6:27,369
WHEN MICROSCOPY BECAME A LOT MORE ADVANCED.
WE HAVE ELECTRON


92
0:6:27,369 --> 0:6:30,169
MICROSCOPY COMING INTO THE SCENE AND PEOPLE
REALLY GET INTO THE


93
0:6:30,169 --> 0:6:35,699
DETAILS OF UNICELLULAR ORGANISMS THAT THIS
FIVE KINGDOM VIEW OF


94
0:6:35,699 --> 0:6:40,449
LIFE WAS PROPOSED. AND IN HERE WE HAVE AGAIN
THE PLANTS AND THE


95
0:6:40,449 --> 0:6:44,969
ANIMALS. BUT PULLED OUT OF THE PLANTS ARE
NOW THE FUNGI.


96
0:6:44,969 --> 0:6:48,18
THESE OTHER GROUPS THAT, THIS MAJOR GROUP
OF THINGS THAT DON'T


97
0:6:48,18 --> 0:6:51,909
MOVE FREELY ABOUT THAT ARE NON-PHOTOSYNTHETIC,
THAT ARE NOT


98
0:6:51,909 --> 0:6:56,39
AUTOTROPHS, THEY CAN'T PRODUCE THEIR OWN FOOD.
AND THESE ARE


99
0:6:56,39 --> 0:7:1,169
THE MAIN MULTI-CELLULAR GROUPS HERE. AND THEN
AMONG THE


100
0:7:1,169 --> 0:7:5,179
UNICELLULAR GROUPS THERE WERE TWO MAJOR GROUPS.
ONE, THE


101
0:7:5,179 --> 0:7:9,619
PROTISTA BASICALLY WAS ALL THESE UNICELLULAR
LIFE FORMS THAT WERE


102
0:7:9,619 --> 0:7:14,96
BECOMING MUCH BETTER UNDERSTOOD. THERE WERE
EUCARYOTES. AND


103
0:7:14,96 --> 0:7:20,339
THEN THE MONERA BASICALLY TAKES IN ALL OF
THE PROCARYOTES WHICH


104
0:7:20,339 --> 0:7:20,409



105
0:7:20,409 --> 0:7:24,809
ARE UNICELLUAR ORGANISMS. WE'RE TALKING HERE
ABOUT WHAT, WHAT'S


106
0:7:24,809 --> 0:7:28,29
BEEN LOOSELY CALLED BACTERIA. AND SOME PEOPLE
WOULD INCLUDE


107
0:7:28,29 --> 0:7:33,419
VIRUSES THERE BUT WE CAN DEBATE ABOUT WHETHER
THOSE SHOULD REALLY


108
0:7:33,419 --> 0:7:39,199
BE CONSIDERED FORMS OF LIFE. THOUGH JUST TO
MAKE SURE


109
0:7:39,199 --> 0:7:41,569
EVERYBODY'S ON THE SAME PAGE HERE, THE PROCARY-,
OR THE


110
0:7:41,569 --> 0:7:48,219
EUCARYOTES, THIS LITERALLY MEANS, EU MEANS
TRUE, SO THESE ARE THE


111
0:7:48,219 --> 0:7:54,8
TRUE NUCLEI BEARERS. CARRION REFERS TO A KERNEL
OR THE NUCLEUS.


112
0:7:54,8 --> 0:7:58,749
SO THESE ARE ORGANISMS THAT POSSESS A MEMBRANE-BOUND
NUCLEUS


113
0:7:58,749 --> 0:8:2,839
WHERE THE NUCLEAR CHROMOSOMES ARE LOCATED.
AND MEMBRANE-BOUND


114
0:8:2,839 --> 0:8:7,649
ORGANELLES THAT ARE IMPORTANT FOR VARIOUS
METABOLIC PROCESSES,


115
0:8:7,649 --> 0:8:12,719
FOR EXAMPLE, MITOCHONDRIA ARE ORGANELLES THAT,
WHERE RESPIRATION


116
0:8:12,719 --> 0:8:16,61
REACTIONS ARE LOCATED. AND THOSE ORGANISMS
THAT ARE


117
0:8:16,61 --> 0:8:20,479
PHOTOSYNTHETIC AND HAVE PLASTIDS, CHLOROPLASTS,
FOR EXAMPLE,


118
0:8:20,479 --> 0:8:25,759
WHERE THE REACTIONS OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS ARE
LOCALIZED, SO THOSE ARE


119
0:8:25,759 --> 0:8:28,599
EUCARYOTES. AND AS I MENTIONED THEY INCLUDE
THE PROTISTS, THE


120
0:8:28,599 --> 0:8:32,34
ANIMALS, PLANTS, AND THE FUNGI, FOUR OF THE
FIVE KINGDOMS. AND


121
0:8:32,34 --> 0:8:37,89
THEN THE PROCARYOTES, BEFORE THE NUCLEUS LITERALLY,
THESE ARE


122
0:8:37,89 --> 0:8:42,18
THINGS PRESUMABLY MORE PRIMITIVE THAT LACK
A NUCLEUS AND


123
0:8:42,18 --> 0:8:46,81
MEMBRANE-BOUND ORGANELLES AND JUST THIS ONE
KINGDOM, THE MONERA.


124
0:8:46,81 --> 0:8:49,26
THIS IS THE SYSTEM THAT WAS IN PLACE WHEN
I WAS A GRAD STUDENT,


125
0:8:49,26 --> 0:8:53,5
WHEN I FIRST WAS INVOLVED IN TEACHING BOTANY
AS A GSI. AND THIS


126
0:8:53,5 --> 0:8:59,87
WAS PRETTY MUCH HELD IN PLACE UNTIL THE 1990S.
AND WHAT HAPPENED


127
0:8:59,87 --> 0:9:7,13
TO CHANGE THIS VIEW WAS THAT IN 19, LATE 1980S,
THAT KARY MULLIS


128
0:9:7,13 --> 0:9:11,32
BASICALLY FIGURED OUT THE IDEA OF PCR WHILE
HE WAS TRIPPING ON


129
0:9:11,32 --> 0:9:16,2
LSD. AND THAT BECAME THE METHOD BY WHICH MOLECULAR
BIOLOGY


130
0:9:16,2 --> 0:9:16,2



131
0:9:16,2 --> 0:9:20,64
UNDERWENT THIS HUGE REVOLUTION AND WE WERE
ABLE TO SEQUENCE THE


132
0:9:20,64 --> 0:9:25,89
DNA RELATIVELY EASILY FOR A WIDE ARRAY OF
DIFFERENT ORGANISMS.


133
0:9:25,89 --> 0:9:28,49
AND WE DIDN'T EVEN HAVE TO ISOLATE THOSE ORGANISMS.
YOU CAN


134
0:9:28,49 --> 0:9:32,4
IMAGINE A LOT OF THESE UNICELLULAR ORGANISMS
VERY DIFFICULT TO


135
0:9:32,4 --> 0:9:35,78
ACTUALLY ISOLATE. IF YOU CAN'T CULTURE THEM,
IT'S GOING TO BE


136
0:9:35,78 --> 0:9:39,57
VERY DIFFICULT TO DISCOVER THEM. AND SO THERE
WAS A HUGE AMOUNT


137
0:9:39,57 --> 0:9:44,27
OF UNDISCOVERED DIVERSITY AMONG THE UNICELLULAR
ORGANISMS THAT


138
0:9:44,27 --> 0:9:48,63
WAS DISCOVERED BY PCR, JUST ENVIRONMENTAL
PCR WHERE WE ACTUALLY


139
0:9:48,63 --> 0:9:53,25
ARE AMPLIFYING DNA OUT OF ROSS OIL SAMPLES
OR SEA WATER, AND ALL


140
0:9:53,25 --> 0:9:56,3
OF A SUDDEN ALL THIS LIFE BECOME EVIDENT THAT
NOBODY HAD EVEN


141
0:9:56,3 --> 0:10:4,62
SEEN YET. AND WHAT THAT REVEALED WAS THAT
THERE WAS A MAJOR


142
0:10:4,62 --> 0:10:9,21
OVER SIMPLIFICATION OF THIS VIEW OF THE PROCARYOTES.
PROKARYOTES


143
0:10:9,21 --> 0:10:13,8
ACTUALLY BROKE INTO TWO MAJOR DOMAINS OF LIFE,
WHAT WE COULD CALL


144
0:10:13,8 --> 0:10:19,0
THE TRUE BACTERIA, HERE, AND THEN THIS OTHER
GROUP CALLED THE


145
0:10:19,0 --> 0:10:24,59
ARCHAEA. THESE, AND THE NAME REFERS TO ARCHAIC.
THESE ANCIENT,


146
0:10:24,59 --> 0:10:29,8
THIS PRESUMABLY ANCIENT GROUP THAT HAS REALLY
BIZARRE BIOLOGY


147
0:10:29,8 --> 0:10:34,63
THAT SEEMS TO PREDATE THE OXYGENATED ATMOSPHERE
IN MANY CASES.


148
0:10:34,63 --> 0:10:38,87
SO THIS, THE PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSES THEN SHOWED
THAT THE


149
0:10:38,87 --> 0:10:43,24
EUCARYOTES, WHICH I'LL GET TO IN A, BACK TO
IN A MOMENT, WERE


150
0:10:43,24 --> 0:10:46,83
ALSO MUCH MORE INTERESTING AND DIVERSE THAN
THOUGHT. BUT THEY


151
0:10:46,83 --> 0:10:51,33
REPRESENT BASICALLY A GROUP ON PAR WITH DIVERSITY
TO THESE TWO


152
0:10:51,33 --> 0:10:54,86
MAJOR GROUPS OF PROCARYOTES. SO PROCARYOTES
ARE JUST VASTLY


153
0:10:54,86 --> 0:10:58,12
MORE DIVERSE THAN PEOPLE THOUGHT. THEY BROKE
INTO TWO REALLY


154
0:10:58,12 --> 0:11:3,2
ANCIENT DIVERGENT GROUPS. HERE YOU CAN SEE
A ROOTED TREE OF


155
0:11:3,2 --> 0:11:5,26
LIFE. AND THE ROOTING OF THE TREE OF LIFE
IS NOT A TRIVIAL


156
0:11:5,26 --> 0:11:5,26



157
0:11:5,26 --> 0:11:9,56
EXERCISE BECAUSE YOU DON'T HAVE AN OUTGROUP
OBVIOUSLY TO LIFE.


158
0:11:9,56 --> 0:11:14,5
YOU CAN'T USE ROCKS OR, YOU KNOW, MINERALS
FOR THAT. GET INTO


159
0:11:14,5 --> 0:11:19,5
HOW ONE DOES THAT, BUT IT'S NOT EASY AND VERY
CONTROVERSIAL.


160
0:11:19,5 --> 0:11:22,28
BUT THE BACTERIA THEN ARE HERE. AND HERE YOU
CAN SEE THE


161
0:11:22,28 --> 0:11:26,4
ARCHAEA. IN THIS ANALYSIS COMING OUT SISTERED
TO ALL THE


162
0:11:26,4 --> 0:11:30,41
EUCARYOTES. THOUGH IN THIS VIEW HERE WE SEE
THAT ACTUALLY THE


163
0:11:30,41 --> 0:11:34,38
ARCHAEA ARE MORE CLOSELY RELATED TO THE EUCARYOTES
THAN THEY ARE


164
0:11:34,38 --> 0:11:39,78
TO THE OTHER PROCARYOTES IN THE BACTERIA.
SO THAT WAS A REALLY


165
0:11:39,78 --> 0:11:43,25
SURPRISE. AND THERE'S SOME CONTROVERSY ABOUT
THIS THAT PERHAPS


166
0:11:43,25 --> 0:11:46,42
THE ARCHAEA, OR THAT THERE MAY BE GENES THAT
HAVE BEEN INHERITED


167
0:11:46,42 --> 0:11:50,28
BY HORIZONTAL TRANSFER FROM BOTH OF THESE
GROUPS THAT WERE


168
0:11:50,28 --> 0:11:55,88
INVESTED IN THE ORIGINAL EUCARYOTES. BUT,
THE MAIN POINT HERE


169
0:11:55,88 --> 0:12:1,0
IS THAT THEY'RE JUST THESE TWO MAJOR GROUPS
OF PROKARYOTES. AND


170
0:12:1,0 --> 0:12:3,84
THE ARCHAEA ARE REALLY COOL BECAUSE THESE
INCLUDE THE


171
0:12:3,84 --> 0:12:8,79
EXTREMOPHILES WHICH LITERALLY MEAN THE LOVERS
OF EXTREME


172
0:12:8,79 --> 0:12:15,17
CONDITIONS. PHILE JUST MEANS LOVE. AND THIS
IS BASICALLY A


173
0:12:15,17 --> 0:12:20,6
CATEGORY THAT INCLUDES THE MAJORITY OF THESE
ARCHAEA. AND THEY


174
0:12:20,6 --> 0:12:26,13
BREAK INTO THREE MAJOR GROUPS. THE HALOPHILES
WHICH ARE LOVERS


175
0:12:26,13 --> 0:12:33,93
OF SALTY CONDITIONS OR SALINE CONDITIONS.
AND IF YOU FLY OVER


176
0:12:33,93 --> 0:12:37,16
THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AND LOOK DOWN AT THE
SOUTH END ON THE EAST


177
0:12:37,16 --> 0:12:43,43
SIDE, YOU'LL SEE THESE AREAS WHERE THESE SALT
FLATS WHERE SALT IS


178
0:12:43,43 --> 0:12:47,66
BEING HARVESTED. AND YOU CAN SEE THE ARCHAEA
HERE IMPARTING THIS


179
0:12:47,66 --> 0:12:50,77
RED COLORATION. THESE ARE ORGANISMS THAT GENERALLY
CAN'T


180
0:12:50,77 --> 0:12:54,8
SURVIVE EXCEPT UNDER REALLY HIGH SALINITY
WHICH WOULD BE AT SUCH


181
0:12:54,8 --> 0:12:58,97
A HIGH LEVEL THAT ANY SELF-RESPECTING EUCARYOTE
WOULD BE, HAVE


182
0:12:58,97 --> 0:12:58,97



183
0:12:58,97 --> 0:13:2,44
THEIR DNA AND THEIR PROTEINS DENATURED. IT
WOULD BE A TOTAL


184
0:13:2,44 --> 0:13:6,1
DISASTER. IT WOULD BE FATAL. BUT THESE ORGANISMS
REALLY


185
0:13:6,1 --> 0:13:10,78
REQUIRE EXTREME CONDITIONS LIKE THIS. AND
WE CAN FIND THESE


186
0:13:10,78 --> 0:13:13,32
THINGS GROWING IN NATURAL ENVIRONMENTS IN,
FOR EXAMPLE, PLACES


187
0:13:13,32 --> 0:13:17,38
LIKE THE GREAT SALT LAKE, VARIOUS SALT FLATS
OUT IN THE DESERT


188
0:13:17,38 --> 0:13:22,6
THAT ARE OCCASIONALLY INUNDATED AFTER STORMS
AND THE LIKE. AND


189
0:13:22,6 --> 0:13:25,4
THAT'S A REALLY INTERESTING GROUP. THESE ARE
MOSTLY AEROBIC


190
0:13:25,4 --> 0:13:30,94
ORGANISMS THAT REQUIRE OXYGEN. THE THERMOPHILES
ARE ANOTHER


191
0:13:30,94 --> 0:13:36,15
MAJOR GROUP. AND THESE ARE EVEN MORE FANTASTIC
REALLY BECAUSE


192
0:13:36,15 --> 0:13:42,18
THESE REQUIRE SUCH WARM CONDITIONS THAT THEY
WOULD ESSENTIALLY,


193
0:13:42,18 --> 0:13:47,76
YOU KNOW, BOIL ALIVE OR, YOU KNOW, BASICALLY
COOK ANY, ANY


194
0:13:47,76 --> 0:13:52,279
EUCARYOTE. AND THESE ARE FOUND IN SUCH PLACES
AS THESE


195
0:13:52,279 --> 0:13:55,81
HYDROTHERMIC VENTS DOWN IN RIFT ZONES AT THE
BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN,


196
0:13:55,81 --> 0:13:58,98
THESE BLACK SMOKERS HERE WHERE IT CAN GET
UP TO 120 DEGREES


197
0:13:58,98 --> 0:14:5,57
CELSIUS, WELL OVER BOILING. AND THIS IS A
SITU-, THESE ARE


198
0:14:5,57 --> 0:14:9,79
BASICALLY PRIMARY PRODUCERS DOWN IN THIS INTERESTING
ECOSYSTEM AT


199
0:14:9,79 --> 0:14:12,82
THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN WHERE WE HAVE SOME
BIZARRE EUCARYOTES AS


200
0:14:12,82 --> 0:14:17,47
WELL. AND THEN WE ALSO FIND THESE THINGS AROUND
ACTUALLY


201
0:14:17,47 --> 0:14:21,62
VOLCANIC VENTS AND, YOU KNOW, THESE HOT SPRINGS
SITUATIONS AND


202
0:14:21,62 --> 0:14:25,48
GEYSERS LIKE IN THE YELLOWSTONE AREA, AROUND
THE OLD FAITHFUL


203
0:14:25,48 --> 0:14:29,96
GEYSER BASE AND IN PLACES LIKE THAT. AND SOME
OF THESE GUYS ARE


204
0:14:29,96 --> 0:14:34,95
ACTUALLY ABLE TO, THEY'RE AUTOTROPHS THAT
ARE ABLE TO PRODUCE


205
0:14:34,95 --> 0:14:40,29
THEIR OWN ENERGY FROM HYDROGEN SULFIDE. SO
THEY'RE ABLE TO MAKE


206
0:14:40,29 --> 0:14:44,9
USE OF CHEMICALS THAT ARE POISONOUS TO US.
SO THESE ARE, ARE


207
0:14:44,9 --> 0:14:49,73
REALLY PRETTY AMAZING ORGANISMS. AND THEN
ALSO THERE'S A GROUP


208
0:14:49,73 --> 0:14:49,779



209
0:14:49,779 --> 0:14:53,91
CALLED METHANOGENS WHICH LIVE IN THE GUTS
OF RUMINANTS IN AN


210
0:14:53,91 --> 0:14:59,91
ANAEROBIC ENVIRONMENT. OXYGEN IS DEADLY TO
THESE THINGS. AND


211
0:14:59,91 --> 0:15:5,97
THEY CAN, THEY HELP CATTLE AND OTHER RUMINANTS
DIGEST CELLULOSE


212
0:15:5,97 --> 0:15:8,89
AND THE LIKE, SO THEY'RE REALLY IMPORTANT
ECOLOGICALLY AND THEY


213
0:15:8,89 --> 0:15:12,49
PRODUCE METHANE AS A WASTE PRODUCT. THAT'S
WHERE THE METHANE


214
0:15:12,49 --> 0:15:20,11
THAT WE ASSOCIATE WITH CATTLE IS, COMES FROM
IN PART. AND AN


215
0:15:20,11 --> 0:15:24,19
INTERESTING SORT OF CIRCULARITY HERE IS THAT
THESE ARCHAEA, THESE


216
0:15:24,19 --> 0:15:30,74
EXTREMOPHILES ARE ACTUALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR
PCR. SO THE DNA


217
0:15:30,74 --> 0:15:35,42
POLYMERASES PRODUCED BY SOME OF THESE THERMOPHILES
ARE STABLE AT


218
0:15:35,42 --> 0:15:39,89
BOILING TEMPERATURES AS I MENTIONED, AND THAT
ALLOWED PCR TO


219
0:15:39,89 --> 0:15:43,2
ACTUALLY BE FEASIBLE BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO DENATURE
THE DNA DURING


220
0:15:43,2 --> 0:15:46,83
THESE CYCLES OF DNA DENATURATION, AND THEN
AMPLIFYING, OR


221
0:15:46,83 --> 0:15:51,5
ANNEALING THE PRIMERS AND EXTENDING THE PRIMERS.
AND IT'S,


222
0:15:51,5 --> 0:15:54,95
ORIGINALLY THERMO BASILIS AQUATICUS FROM YELLOWSTONE
NATIONAL


223
0:15:54,95 --> 0:15:59,9
PARK THAT WAS USED TO ALLOW FOR PCR, SO THIS
ARCHAEA GROUP WAS


224
0:15:59,9 --> 0:16:4,79
DISCOVERED BECAUSE OF THE ARCHAEA. AND WITHOUT
THE ARCHAEA, WE


225
0:16:4,79 --> 0:16:8,9
WOULDN'T HAVE DISCOVERED THE ARCHAEA, SO IT'S
KIND OF AN


226
0:16:8,9 --> 0:16:13,82
INTERESTING SITUATION THERE. NOW TAKING THE
ARCHAEA ASIDE, THE


227
0:16:13,82 --> 0:16:18,48
REMAINING TRUE BACTERIA ARE NO LESS INTERESTING
IN TERMS OF THEIR


228
0:16:18,48 --> 0:16:23,529
METABOLIC COMPLEXITY. IN FACT, THEY SHOW EVERY
MAJOR MODE OF


229
0:16:23,529 --> 0:16:27,29
NUTRITION IN METABOLISM, EVEN MORE SO THAN
WE GET IN ARCHAEA


230
0:16:27,29 --> 0:16:30,79
BECAUSE NONE OF THE ARCHAEA ARE CAPABLE OF
PHOTOSYNTHESIS. TRUE


231
0:16:30,79 --> 0:16:34,52
PHOTOSYNTHESIS WHERE WE'RE TAKING THE ENERGY
FROM LIGHT AND USING


232
0:16:34,52 --> 0:16:40,16
THAT TO FIX INORGANIC CARBON INTO SUGARS.
THAT'S ONLY SOMETHING


233
0:16:40,16 --> 0:16:45,57
THAT THE CYANOBACTERIA, THIS GROUP HERE HAS
FIGURED OUT HOW TO DO


234
0:16:45,57 --> 0:16:45,57



235
0:16:45,57 --> 0:16:48,58
IN A MAJOR WAY. THERE ARE SOME OTHER, THERE
ISN'T ANOTHER MINOR


236
0:16:48,58 --> 0:16:53,47
EXAMPLE, BUT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE CYANOBACTERIA
INNOVATED


237
0:16:53,47 --> 0:16:58,7
THE CAPABILITY FOR PHOTOSYNTHETIC, PHOTOSYNTHESIS.
AND IT'S


238
0:16:58,7 --> 0:17:2,25
BECAUSE OF THESE CYANOBACTERIA THAT WE HAVE
AN OXYGENATED


239
0:17:2,25 --> 0:17:6,519
ATMOSPHERE WHICH AROSE ABOUT 1.8 BILLION YEARS
AGO AND ALLOWED


240
0:17:6,519 --> 0:17:12,11
FOR THE EUCARYOTES TO REALLY COME INTO BEING.
AND THESE


241
0:17:12,11 --> 0:17:15,789
CYANOBACTERIA ARE ALSO REALLY IMPORTANT FOR
NITROGEN FIXATION.


242
0:17:15,789 --> 0:17:18,659
YOU'RE PROBABLY AWARE THAT OUR ATMOSPHERE
IS MOSTLY COMPRISED OF


243
0:17:18,659 --> 0:17:23,879
NITROGEN GAS, BUT THAT NITROGEN IS UNAVAILABLE
TO ORGANISMS.


244
0:17:23,879 --> 0:17:27,619
AND IT'S ONLY THROUGH THE ACTION OF NITROGEN
FIXERS LIKE THESE


245
0:17:27,619 --> 0:17:32,379
CYANOBACTERIA THAT CAN, THAT WE HAVE NITROGEN
AVAILABLE WHICH IS


246
0:17:32,379 --> 0:17:36,19
AN ESSENTIAL NUTRIENT FOR ORGANISMS. AND IT'S
EASILY LOST FROM


247
0:17:36,19 --> 0:17:41,779
ECOSYSTEMS BY, IT'S EASILY LEACHED OUT OF
SOILS, FOR EXAMPLE, SO


248
0:17:41,779 --> 0:17:46,49
IT'S REALLY CRITICAL FUNCTIONS HERE. AS WE'LL
GET TO NEXT TIME,


249
0:17:46,49 --> 0:17:52,61
THE CYANOBACTERIA ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL
OF OUR PHOTOSYNTHETIC


250
0:17:52,61 --> 0:17:54,559
EUCARYOTES ESSENTIALLY. THAT MAY SOUND A LITTLE
STRANGE BUT


251
0:17:54,559 --> 0:18:1,779
WE'LL GET TO THAT AND IN GOOD TIME HERE. OKAY,
SO I THINK THAT


252
0:18:1,779 --> 0:18:6,72
OF YOU'VE BEEN ALREADY INTRODUCED TO THESE
CONCEPTS OF MAJOR


253
0:18:6,72 --> 0:18:9,919
MODES OF LIVING, THE AUTOTROPHS AND THE HETEROTROPHS
IN THE


254
0:18:9,919 --> 0:18:13,72
ECOLOGY PART. BUT I'LL JUST REVIEW THIS BRIEFLY.
BASICALLY


255
0:18:13,72 --> 0:18:16,929
AUTOTROPHS ARE ORGANISMS THAT CAN GENERATE
THEIR OWN FOOD FROM


256
0:18:16,929 --> 0:18:24,47
INORGANIC MATERIALS OR FROM NON-ORGANIC, BY,
WITHOUT THE


257
0:18:24,47 --> 0:18:28,69
REQUIREMENT OF NON-ORGANIC SOURCES BASICALLY.
SO THE


258
0:18:28,69 --> 0:18:31,57
PHOTOAUTOTROPHS, INCLUDING THE CYANO- OR THE,
BASICALLY THE


259
0:18:31,57 --> 0:18:35,499
CYANOBACTERIA THAT WE TALKED ABOUT SO FAR,
I JUST MENTIONED THEM.


260
0:18:35,499 --> 0:18:35,499



261
0:18:35,499 --> 0:18:38,169
THE CHEMOAUTOTROPHS, I ALLUDED TO THOSE. THESE
ARE THINGS LIKE


262
0:18:38,169 --> 0:18:41,83
SULFOLOBUS HERE, WHICH I REALIZE KIND OF LOOKS
LIKE A PEPPERONI


263
0:18:41,83 --> 0:18:46,419
PIZZA HERE, BUT THAT'S ACTUALLY A CELL. THAT'S
ONE OF THESE,


264
0:18:46,419 --> 0:18:52,369
THESE ARCHAEA THAT CAN BASICALLY DERIVE ENERGY
FROM HYDROGEN


265
0:18:52,369 --> 0:18:59,429
SULFIDE. AND HETEROTROPHS THEN ARE BASICALLY
EVERYTHING ELSE


266
0:18:59,429 --> 0:19:4,2
THAT FEED ON EITHER OTHER ORGANISMS DIRECTLY
OR ON THE PRODUCTS


267
0:19:4,2 --> 0:19:8,19
OF THOSE ORGANISMS, SO ORGANIC SUBSTANCES.
AND, OF COURSE, WE


268
0:19:8,19 --> 0:19:12,529
DON'T REALLY UNDERSTAND EXACTLY HOW LIFE EVOLVED,
THE ORIGINAL


269
0:19:12,529 --> 0:19:14,419
ORGANISMS, BUT IT'S THOUGHT THAT THE ORIGINAL
ORGANISMS WERE


270
0:19:14,419 --> 0:19:19,49
HETEROTROPHS, AND THEY WERE FEEDING ON ORGANIC
COMPOUNDS THAT


271
0:19:19,49 --> 0:19:23,639
WERE PRODUCED BY NON-ORGANIC MEANS BY, BUT
NOT BY LIVING


272
0:19:23,639 --> 0:19:29,529
ORGANISMS. SO IN SOME SORT OF PRIMORDIAL SOUP.
BUT SUBSEQUENT


273
0:19:29,529 --> 0:19:32,59
TO THAT AFTER THE EVO-, EVOLOUTION OF AUTOTROPHS,
THE AUTOTROPHS,


274
0:19:32,59 --> 0:19:35,39
WHICH ARE GOING TO BE WHAT WE'RE GOING TO
REALLY FOCUS ON IN THIS


275
0:19:35,39 --> 0:19:40,32
BOTANICAL PART OF THE COURSE AFTER THE FUNGI,
THEY, THEY REALLY


276
0:19:40,32 --> 0:19:45,159
KIND OF CREATED THE CONDITIONS FOR LIFE TO
EXIST HERE TO A GREAT


277
0:19:45,159 --> 0:19:54,679
EXTENT. OKAY, SO THIS AGAIN IS JUST THAT FIVE
KINGDOM SYSTEM IN


278
0:19:54,679 --> 0:19:58,279
THE CONTEXT OF NOW THIS THREE DOMAIN SYSTEM.
NOW A DOMAIN IS NOT


279
0:19:58,279 --> 0:20:1,669
REALLY A FORMAL TAXON. IT'S AN INFORMAL GROUP,
BUT THESE ARE


280
0:20:1,669 --> 0:20:5,98
GOOD GROUPS. BACTERIA, THE ARCHAEA BEING EQUIVALENT
TO THE OLD


281
0:20:5,98 --> 0:20:11,239
MONERA. ALL THE OLD PROCARYOTES HERE. AND
THEN WE CONSIDER


282
0:20:11,239 --> 0:20:15,929
THE, ALL THE EUCARYOTES A SINGLE DOMAIN OF
LIFE, INCLUDING THESE


283
0:20:15,929 --> 0:20:19,94
OLD FOUR KINGDOMS THAT ARE NO LONGER RECOGNIZED
AS KINGDOMS PER


284
0:20:19,94 --> 0:20:27,49
SAY. AND THIS KIND OF LUMPING ALL OF THESE
GROUPS INTO ONE BIG


285
0:20:27,49 --> 0:20:30,58
EUCARYOTE DOESN'T MEAN THAT THOSE EUCARYOTES
ARE LESS DIVERSE


286
0:20:30,58 --> 0:20:30,69



287
0:20:30,69 --> 0:20:32,97
THAN WE THOUGHT BEFORE. IT'S ACTUALLY THAT
THEY'RE, THEY'RE


288
0:20:32,97 --> 0:20:36,549
EVEN MORE DIVERSE AND MORE COMPLEX IN THEIR
RELATIONSHIPS AND


289
0:20:36,549 --> 0:20:40,899
THAT THIS IS A VAST OVER SIMPLIFICATION HERE
OF THE RELATIONSHIPS


290
0:20:40,899 --> 0:20:47,679
OF, OF EUCARYOTES. YOU JUST PUT THEM INTO
THOSE FOUR CUBBIES.


291
0:20:47,679 --> 0:20:51,429
AND HERE YOU CAN SEE THE OVERALL TREE OF LIFE.
AND SORT OF,


292
0:20:51,429 --> 0:20:58,82
WELL, IT'S ROOTED HERE. BUT IT'S LAID OUT
IN SORT OF AN


293
0:20:58,82 --> 0:21:2,73
UNROOTED GENERAL PERSPECTIVE WITH THE ARCHAEA
HERE IN PINK.


294
0:21:2,73 --> 0:21:6,2
THESE ARE THOSE EXTREMOPHILES AND RELATIVES.
THE TRUE BACTERIA,


295
0:21:6,2 --> 0:21:9,649
INCLUDING THE CYANOBACTERIA THAT I MENTIONED
THAT ARE


296
0:21:9,649 --> 0:21:13,889
PHOTOSYNTHETIC. AND HERE'S ALL THE EUCARYOTE
UP HERE IN GRAY.


297
0:21:13,889 --> 0:21:19,32
AND HIGHLIGHTED HERE ARE THE MAJOR TERRESTRIAL
MULTICELLULAR


298
0:21:19,32 --> 0:21:25,45
GROUPS THAT OCCUR ON LAND. THE FUNGI, THE
ANIMALS, AND THE LAND


299
0:21:25,45 --> 0:21:28,869
PLANTS. AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THEY'RE JUST
LITTLE TWIGS IN THIS


300
0:21:28,869 --> 0:21:33,739
BIG EUCARYOTIC BRANCH OF LIFE AND THAT THEY'RE
NOT VERY CLOSELY


301
0:21:33,739 --> 0:21:37,7
RELATED TO ONE ANOTHER. IN FACT, BASED ON
THE RELATIONSHIPS IT


302
0:21:37,7 --> 0:21:40,61
LOOKS LIKE THEY'VE EACH INDEPENDENTLY BEEN
DERIVED FROM


303
0:21:40,61 --> 0:21:44,97
UNICELLULAR ORGANISMS. SO MULTICELLULARITY'S
ARISEN MULTIPLE


304
0:21:44,97 --> 0:21:51,239
TIMES IN EACH OF THESE GROUPS. I MEAN, IT
HAS ARISEN


305
0:21:51,239 --> 0:21:54,84
INDEPENDENTLY IN EACH OF THOSE GROUPS. THOUGH
YOU MIGHT WONDER


306
0:21:54,84 --> 0:21:58,249
ABOUT VIRUSES. I MEAN THEY'RE CLEARLY CRITICALLY
IMPORTANT IN


307
0:21:58,249 --> 0:22:4,389
MEDICINE I MEAN AND HUMAN HEALTH. THEY CLEARLY
EVOLVED VERY


308
0:22:4,389 --> 0:22:10,159
QUICKLY. THEY HAVE NUCLEIC ACIDS. THEY HAVE
DNA OR RNA. BUT


309
0:22:10,159 --> 0:22:13,47
THEY'RE INERT UNLESS THEY'RE IN THE PRESENCE
OF THE LIVING CELLS


310
0:22:13,47 --> 0:22:18,119
OF ONE OF THESE GROUPS. AND UNFORTUNATELY
THEY DON'T HAVE VERY


311
0:22:18,119 --> 0:22:21,119
MUCH, WELL, THEY DON'T HAVE VERY MUCH DNA
TYPICALLY. AND IT


312
0:22:21,119 --> 0:22:21,119



313
0:22:21,119 --> 0:22:24,59
LOOKS LIKE THEY'VE INHERITED THEIR DNA IN
MANY CASES BY


314
0:22:24,59 --> 0:22:30,489
HORIZONTAL TRANSFER FROM THEIR HOSTS. AND
SO THESE ARE VERY


315
0:22:30,489 --> 0:22:35,409
DIFFICULT TO, TO ACTUALLY ANALYZE IN THE CONTEXT
OF THE REST OF


316
0:22:35,409 --> 0:22:38,809
THE TREE OF LIFE AND FIGURE OUT HOW THEY EVOLVED.
ONE THING WE


317
0:22:38,809 --> 0:22:42,129
CAN SAY IS THAT THEY'RE MOBILE, THEY ARE MOBILE
GENETIC ELEMENTS


318
0:22:42,129 --> 0:22:47,7
ESSENTIALLY, COMPARABLE IN A LOT OF RESPECTS
TO PLASMIDS THAT


319
0:22:47,7 --> 0:22:53,32
LIVE INSIDE BACTERIAL CELLS OR TRANSPOSONS
THAT LIVE ACROSS


320
0:22:53,32 --> 0:22:57,769
BASICALLY ALL OF LIFE. AND THEY MAY HAVE THEIR
ORIGINS FROM


321
0:22:57,769 --> 0:23:1,379
SUCH THINGS AS PLASMIDS OR TRANSPOSONS, BUT
WE'RE NOT SURE. AND


322
0:23:1,379 --> 0:23:4,649
THEY MAY HAVE VARIOUS DIFFERENT ORIGINS. SO
THEY'RE SORT OF LEFT


323
0:23:4,649 --> 0:23:7,46
OUT OF THIS PICTURE, BUT WE'RE NOT CONSIDERING
THEM UNIMPORTANT.


324
0:23:7,46 --> 0:23:15,1
THEY'RE JUST DIFFICULT TO INCLUDE.


325
0:23:15,1 --> 0:23:16,159
OKAY, SO NOW I WANT TO JUST


326
0:23:16,159 --> 0:23:18,539
GIVE YOU A GENERAL PERSPECTIVE ON THE ORGANISMS
WE'RE REALLY


327
0:23:18,539 --> 0:23:24,649
GOING TO FOCUS ON FOR THE REST OF SEMESTER.
THOUGH FIRST OFF


328
0:23:24,649 --> 0:23:29,48
WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE FUNGI AS I MENTIONED
HERE, WHICH


329
0:23:29,48 --> 0:23:33,7
USED TO BE CALLED PLANTS. NOWADAYS PEOPLE
THAT STUDY FUNGI ARE


330
0:23:33,7 --> 0:23:40,129
CALLED MYCOLOGISTS RATHER THAN BOTANISTS.
MYCOLOGY. MYCOLOGY


331
0:23:40,129 --> 0:23:46,419
IS THE STUDY OF FUNGI. AND SOME BOTANY DEPARTMENTS
THAT STILL


332
0:23:46,419 --> 0:23:49,46
EXIST USUALLY INCLUDE MYCOLOGISTS. FOR EXAMPLE,
OUR PLANT AND


333
0:23:49,46 --> 0:23:53,409
MICROBIAL BIOLOGY DEPARTMENT INCLUDES A COUPLE
OF MYCOLOGISTS


334
0:23:53,409 --> 0:23:57,419
THERE. SO THIS LINNEAN OR ARISTOTLE, YOU KNOW,
HOLDOVER FROM THE


335
0:23:57,419 --> 0:24:2,96
ANCIENT GREEKS INCLUDE, IS STILL SEEN IN OUR
DEPARTMENTAL


336
0:24:2,96 --> 0:24:8,69
ORGANIZATIONS. AND THEN THE SO-CALLED ALGAE
WHICH ARE BASICALLY


337
0:24:8,69 --> 0:24:16,409
MARINE OR AQUATIC, TYPICALLY MARINE OR AQUATIC
PHOTOSYNTHETIC


338
0:24:16,409 --> 0:24:19,669
ORGANISMS. YOU CAN SEE THAT THEY FALL OUT
ALL OVER THE PLACE,


339
0:24:19,669 --> 0:24:20,57



340
0:24:20,57 --> 0:24:25,119
THAT THEY'RE NOT A MONOPHYLETIC GROUP OR A
CLADE, AND THAT THE


341
0:24:25,119 --> 0:24:28,889
ALGAE ARE MUCH, MUCH MORE WIDELY SCATTERED
IN THE TREE OF LIFE


342
0:24:28,889 --> 0:24:33,73
THAN ANYBODY GUESSED PRIOR TO THIS MOLECULAR
BIOLOGY REVOLUTION


343
0:24:33,73 --> 0:24:37,639
BACK IN THE '90S. BUT AS WE'LL GET TO NEXT
TIME, THEY'RE


344
0:24:37,639 --> 0:24:41,249
ACTUALLY IN SOME REGARD MORE CLOSELY RELATED
THAN THEY APPEAR


345
0:24:41,249 --> 0:24:44,45
BASED ON THIS TREE. SO THAT'S WHEN WE START
TALKING ABOUT THE


346
0:24:44,45 --> 0:24:47,6
ORIGIN OF PHOTOSYNTHESIS NEXT TIME. BUT JUST
KEEP THAT IN THE


347
0:24:47,6 --> 0:24:52,409
BACK OF YOUR MIND. AND THEN FINALLY THE THINGS
THAT WE CAN ALL


348
0:24:52,409 --> 0:24:58,69
AGREE ARE ACTUALLY PLANTS, THE LAND PLANTS,
THE TRUE GREEN


349
0:24:58,69 --> 0:25:2,59
PLANTS, THESE ARE, THAT OCCUR ON TERRESTRIAL
HABITATS, THESE ARE


350
0:25:2,59 --> 0:25:7,779
A NATURAL GROUP, A MONOPHYLETIC GROUP THAT
WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT


351
0:25:7,779 --> 0:25:14,34
FOR MOST OF THE SEMESTER. AND YOU CAN SEE
THAT THEY'RE CLOSELY


352
0:25:14,34 --> 0:25:20,519
RELATED TO SOME BUT NOT ALL OF THE ALGAE.
OKAY, SO LET'S FOCUS


353
0:25:20,519 --> 0:25:23,669
IN ON THE FUNGI NOW. THIS IS GOING TO BE THE
TOPIC FOR THE REST


354
0:25:23,669 --> 0:25:26,7
OF LECTURE TODAY. AND IT WILL SPILLOVER NEXT
TIME INTO TALKING


355
0:25:26,7 --> 0:25:31,159
ABOUT THEM IN TERMS OF THEIR ECOLOGICAL IMPORTANCE.
BUT YOU CAN


356
0:25:31,159 --> 0:25:34,259
SEE THAT THE FUNGI ARE REALLY DISTANTLY RELATED
TO THE LAND


357
0:25:34,259 --> 0:25:38,539
PLANTS, THE PLANTS IN THE STRICTEST SENSE.
AND THAT THEY'RE


358
0:25:38,539 --> 0:25:40,71
ACTUALLY, I ALREADY MENTIONED THAT THEY'VE
INDEPENDENTLY EVOLVED


359
0:25:40,71 --> 0:25:46,769
MULTICELLULARITY RELATIVE TO THE PLANTS AND
THE ANIMALS ACTUALLY.


360
0:25:46,769 --> 0:25:50,6
BUT YOU CAN SEE THEY'RE QUITE CLOSELY RELATED
TO ANIMALS, THAT


361
0:25:50,6 --> 0:25:53,739
THEY'RE ACTUALLY MUCH MORE CLOSELY RELATED
TO ANIMALS THAN THEY


362
0:25:53,739 --> 0:25:56,779
ARE TO PLANTS. AND REALLY WE SHOULD BE INCLUDING
FUNGI AND


363
0:25:56,779 --> 0:26:0,98
ZOOLOGY DEPARTMENTS IF SUCH DEPARTMENTS STILL
EXISTED RATHER THAN


364
0:26:0,98 --> 0:26:6,21
BOTANY DEPARTMENTS. AND THAT WAS A REALLY
MAJOR SURPRISE. BUT


365
0:26:6,21 --> 0:26:6,21



366
0:26:6,21 --> 0:26:11,899
THERE'S SOME THINGS IN HINDSIGHT THAT MAKE
SENSE ABOUT THAT.


367
0:26:11,899 --> 0:26:15,869
THOUGH, AND ACTUALLY THE FUNGI ARE MORE CLOSELY
RELATED TO


368
0:26:15,869 --> 0:26:19,82
ANIMALS THAN TO ANY PHOTOSYNTHETIC ORGANISM.
AND NEITHER THE


369
0:26:19,82 --> 0:26:24,369
ANIMALS NOR THE FUNGI SHOW ANY EVIDENCE OF
HAVING EVER HAD


370
0:26:24,369 --> 0:26:29,759
PLASTIDS, EVER HAD ANY KIND OF PHOTOSYNTHETIC
APPARATUS THAT THEY


371
0:26:29,759 --> 0:26:33,409
MAY HAVE LOST. THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT THAT
EVER WAS THE CASE.


372
0:26:33,409 --> 0:26:36,58
AND THEY SHARE A COMMON ANCESTOR BASED ON
FOSSIL AND MOLECULAR


373
0:26:36,58 --> 0:26:40,47
CONSIDERATIONS ABOUT A BILLION YEARS AGO,
WHICH SOUNDS LIKE A


374
0:26:40,47 --> 0:26:44,769
LONG TIME AGO, BUT EUCARYOTES STARTED REALLY
EVOLVING ALMOST


375
0:26:44,769 --> 0:26:48,73
TWICE THAT LONG AGO, I MEAN BACK ALMOST 2
BILLION YEARS AGO. SO


376
0:26:48,73 --> 0:26:53,619
THAT'S NOT REALLY ALL THAT LONG AGO IN THE
OVERALL HISTORY OF THE


377
0:26:53,619 --> 0:26:56,379
EUCARYOTES. AND THAT'S REFLECTED PRETTY NICELY
IN THIS TREE.


378
0:26:56,379 --> 0:27:3,179
SO LET'S FOCUS NOW IN ON CHARACTERISTICS OF
THE FUNGI. THE FUNGI


379
0:27:3,179 --> 0:27:6,989
HAVE SOME REALLY AMAZING FEATURES THAT MAKE
THEM ENDLESSLY


380
0:27:6,989 --> 0:27:11,32
FASCINATING TO EVERYONE. FUNGI I THINK ARE
REALLY FASCINATING


381
0:27:11,32 --> 0:27:15,48
TO THE LAY PUBLIC AND EVERYONE BECAUSE THEY'RE
SO DIFFERENT FROM,


382
0:27:15,48 --> 0:27:20,7
FROM OTHER ORGANISMS. AND YOU CAN SEE THEY
INCLUDE A WIDE ARRAY


383
0:27:20,7 --> 0:27:24,96
OF MULTICELLULAR ORGANISMS. AND THERE ALSO
ARE SOME UNICELLULAR


384
0:27:24,96 --> 0:27:28,95
FUNGI AS WELL, THE YEASTS. AND THERE ARE ABOUT
A HUNDRED


385
0:27:28,95 --> 0:27:33,9
THOUSAND SPECIES OF FUNGI THAT ARE RECOGNIZED
THAT HAVE ACTUALLY


386
0:27:33,9 --> 0:27:36,989
BEEN DESCRIBED, BUT THERE ARE PROBABLY VASTLY
MORE FUNGI THAT


387
0:27:36,989 --> 0:27:41,629
REMAIN UNDESCRIBED AND REMAIN TO BE DISCOVERED.
AND THAT'S


388
0:27:41,629 --> 0:27:46,379
ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR THE YEASTS, THESE UNICELLULAR
FUNGI WHICH MAY


389
0:27:46,379 --> 0:27:49,379
INCLUDE MORE THAN A HUNDRED THOUSAND TAXA.
THERE'S ONLY LIKE


390
0:27:49,379 --> 0:27:55,91
1500 DESCRIBED, BUT THERE MAY BE LIKE 150,000
YEASTS THAT AWAIT


391
0:27:55,91 --> 0:27:56,21



392
0:27:56,21 --> 0:27:59,929
DESCRIPTION. SO THE YEAST MAY ACTUALLY OUT
NUMBER THE


393
0:27:59,929 --> 0:28:4,9
MULTICELLULAR FUNGI. BUT THEY'RE JUST, THERE'S
NOT A LOT OF


394
0:28:4,9 --> 0:28:10,489
MORPHOLOGY TO GO ON THERE TO DESCRIBE THEM.
OKAY, IN TERMS OF


395
0:28:10,489 --> 0:28:15,139
MAJOR FUNGAL CHARACTERISTICS THEN, OF COURSE,
THEY'RE EUCARYOTES.


396
0:28:15,139 --> 0:28:19,49
THEY HAVE MEMBRANE-BOUND NUCLEI AND MITOCHONDRIA,
BUT NO


397
0:28:19,49 --> 0:28:23,729
PLASTIDS. THEY DON'T HAVE ANY EVIDENCE OF
HAVING EVER BEEN


398
0:28:23,729 --> 0:28:28,29
PHOTOSYNTHETIC. THEIR BODIES ARE NON-MOTILE.
OF COURSE THIS


399
0:28:28,29 --> 0:28:30,649
IS ONE OF THE REASON THEY WERE CONSIDERED
PLANTS BACK IN THE OLD


400
0:28:30,649 --> 0:28:35,749
SENSE. I SHOULD SAY THEIR MAIN ADULT BODIES
ARE TYPICALLY


401
0:28:35,749 --> 0:28:39,489
NON-MOTILE. THERE ARE SOME EXCEPTIONS. AND
THAT'S ONE OF THE


402
0:28:39,489 --> 0:28:43,639
THINGS THAT I THINK YOU MAY HAVE ALREADY FOUND
OUT IF YOU TOOK 1A


403
0:28:43,639 --> 0:28:45,509
AND TALKED ABOUT ANIMALS THERE. WHEN YOU START
TALKING ABOUT


404
0:28:45,509 --> 0:28:48,559
THE DIVERSITY OF LIFE, THERE ARE ALWAYS EXCEPTIONS
TO THE RULES.


405
0:28:48,559 --> 0:28:50,909
BUT WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON THE GENERAL --
 YEAH?


406
0:28:50,909 --> 0:28:52,169
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]


407
0:28:52,169 --> 0:28:57,489
PROFESSOR: OH, MOTILE JUST MEANS THE ABILITY
TO MOVE. YEAH,


408
0:28:57,489 --> 0:29:3,33
SORRY, BE ABLE TO MOVE AROUND FREELY. THANKS
FOR ASKING. AND


409
0:29:3,33 --> 0:29:7,279
THEY HAVE A FILAMENTOUS TYPE OF BODY. AND
THAT MAY STRIKE YOU


410
0:29:7,279 --> 0:29:11,49
AS WEIRD IF YOU'VE SEEN MUSHROOMS. THOSE SEEM
LIKE BIG SOLID


411
0:29:11,49 --> 0:29:15,2
OBJECTS, BUT THEY'RE ACTUALLY MADE UP OF FILAMENTS,
DISCREET


412
0:29:15,2 --> 0:29:19,239
FILAMENTS THAT ARE ALL INTERWOVEN, THAT ARE
WEAVED, WEAVED


413
0:29:19,239 --> 0:29:24,7
TOGETHER. AND WE CALL THESE FILAMENTS HYPHAE,
OR THAT'S, THAT'S


414
0:29:24,7 --> 0:29:28,97
ACTUALLY PLURAL. HYPHA WOULD BE SINGULAR.
AND THESE MAKE UP


415
0:29:28,97 --> 0:29:33,979
TOGETHER WHAT'S CALLED THE BODY OF THE FUNGUS,
THE MYCELIUM.


416
0:29:33,979 --> 0:29:37,64
OKAY, SO THAT'S WHAT WE CALL, THIS REFERS
TO BODY OF FUNGUS.


417
0:29:37,64 --> 0:29:37,639



418
0:29:37,639 --> 0:29:44,249
THAT'S WHAT IT LITERALLY MEANS. AND THESE
ARE HETEROTROPHS.


419
0:29:44,249 --> 0:29:50,789
THEY NEED ORGANIC CARBON THAT'S BEEN FIXED
BY SOME OTHER


420
0:29:50,789 --> 0:29:54,109
ORGANISMS. BUT THEY CAN'T ACTUALLY ENGULF
IT. THEY DON'T HAVE


421
0:29:54,109 --> 0:29:58,539
A WAY TO ACTUALLY SWALLOW BIG CHUNKS OF ORGANIC
MATERIAL. THEY


422
0:29:58,539 --> 0:30:3,509
AREN'T CAPABLE OF PHAGOCYTOSIS, YOU KNOW,
LIKE AN AMOEBA, TO


423
0:30:3,509 --> 0:30:8,59
SURROUND SOMETHING AND DIGEST IT. THEY HAVE
TO ACTUALLY


424
0:30:8,59 --> 0:30:11,889
ENZYMATICALLY DEGRADE ORGANIC MATERIAL OUTSIDE
THEIR BODIES.


425
0:30:11,889 --> 0:30:17,559
THEY HAVE TO BASICALLY EXUDE ENZYMES INTO
THEIR ENVIRONMENT,


426
0:30:17,559 --> 0:30:20,109
BREAK DOWN THAT MATERIAL, AND THEN ABSORB
IT THROUGH THEIR


427
0:30:20,109 --> 0:30:27,35
HYPHAE. SO THEY HAVE AN ABSORPTIVE MODE OF
NUTRITION. AND


428
0:30:27,35 --> 0:30:30,549
THEY ACTUALLY, THEY DO HAVE CELL WALLS. NOW
REMEMBER ANIMALS


429
0:30:30,549 --> 0:30:36,109
DON'T HAVE CELL WALLS. ALL THE EUCARYOTES
HAVE CELL MEMBRANES,


430
0:30:36,109 --> 0:30:39,429
BUT ONLY CERTAIN EUCARYOTES HAVE CELL WALLS
WHICH ARE OUTSIDE THE


431
0:30:39,429 --> 0:30:43,889
CELL MEMBRANES. THESE IN PART SOME RIGIDITY,
RIGIDNESS TO THE,


432
0:30:43,889 --> 0:30:46,559
TO THE CELLS. THIS IS ONE OF THE REASONS THAT
THEY WERE


433
0:30:46,559 --> 0:30:51,95
CONSIDERED PLANTS IS THAT PLANTS ALSO HAVE
CELL WALLS UNLIKE


434
0:30:51,95 --> 0:30:57,809
ANIMALS. BUT THESE CELL WALLS IN FUNGI ARE
COMPRISED MOSTLY OF


435
0:30:57,809 --> 0:31:2,809
CHITIN, WHICH IS THE SUBSTANCE THAT MAKES
UP THE EXOSKELETONS OF


436
0:31:2,809 --> 0:31:7,779
ARTHROPODS LIKE INSECTS AND CRUSTACEANS. SO
FUNGI ACTUALLY, AS


437
0:31:7,779 --> 0:31:10,499
ONE OF THEIR MAJOR CONSTITUENTS, THEY SHARE
A LOT WITH THE


438
0:31:10,499 --> 0:31:14,419
ARTHROPODS, WHICH YOU PROBABLY DIDN'T REALIZE
BUT THAT'S A


439
0:31:14,419 --> 0:31:18,499
PRETTY, INTERESTING SIMILARITY THERE. UNLIKE
IN PLANTS WHERE


440
0:31:18,499 --> 0:31:22,8
THE CELL WALLS ARE MADE UP OF CELLULOSE. NOW
BOTH CHITIN AND


441
0:31:22,8 --> 0:31:25,7
CELLULOSE ARE COMPLEX CARBOHYDRATES, BUT THEY
HAVE VERY DIFFERENT


442
0:31:25,7 --> 0:31:29,69
COMPOSITION. AND THERE'S A REALLY FUNDAMENTAL
DIFFERENCE HERE


443
0:31:29,69 --> 0:31:29,69



444
0:31:29,69 --> 0:31:37,519
BETWEEN PLANTS AND FUNGI. ALSO THE FUNGI STORE
THEIR CARBON AS


445
0:31:37,519 --> 0:31:41,999
A COMPLEX CARBOHYDRATE LIKE PLANTS, BUT IN
PLANTS THEY STORE


446
0:31:41,999 --> 0:31:46,299
THEIR, THEIR CARBOHYDRATES AS STARCH. WHEREAS
IN FUNGI THEY


447
0:31:46,299 --> 0:31:49,94
STORE IT AS GLYCOGEN JUST LIKE WE DO. SO THEY
SHARE WITH


448
0:31:49,94 --> 0:31:54,899
ANIMALS THIS STORAGE SUBSTANCE OF GLYCOGIN.
SO THAT'S ANOTHER


449
0:31:54,899 --> 0:31:59,57
INTERESTING SIMILARITY WITH ANIMALS. WITH,
ACTUALLY WITH ALL


450
0:31:59,57 --> 0:32:4,539
ANIMALS HERE AS OPPOSED TO JUST SOME HERE.
OKAY, THE LIFE CYCLE


451
0:32:4,539 --> 0:32:9,45
OF FUNGI INCLUDES SPORES. AND IN THIS REGARD
THEY'RE SIMILAR TO


452
0:32:9,45 --> 0:32:14,729
PLANTS. PLANTS ALSO HAVE SPORES IN THEIR LIFE
CYCLES. AND


453
0:32:14,729 --> 0:32:18,249
THAT'S ONE THING THAT HAS BEEN POINTED TO
AS A BOTANICAL OR


454
0:32:18,249 --> 0:32:22,509
PLANT-LIKE FEATURE EVEN THOUGH IT'S NOT DIAGNOSTIC
OF A CLOSE


455
0:32:22,509 --> 0:32:24,909
RELATIONSHIP WITH PLANTS. AND I ALREADY MENTIONED
THAT THEY'RE


456
0:32:24,909 --> 0:32:30,889
BOTH UNICELLULAR AND MULTICELLULAR. OKAY,
SO ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT


457
0:32:30,889 --> 0:32:34,83
CHARACTERISTICS OF FUNGI? WE'RE GOING TO GET
INTO MORE OF THAT


458
0:32:34,83 --> 0:32:41,2
IN A SECOND HERE. SO HERE WE SEE SOME FUNGI
HYPHAE. HERE YOU


459
0:32:41,2 --> 0:32:45,409
CAN SEE AN ENLARGED PIECE OF THE MYCELIUM
WHERE YOU CAN SEE THESE


460
0:32:45,409 --> 0:32:49,369
INDIVIDUAL FILAMENTS MAKING UP THESE, I MEAN
I'M SURE YOU'VE SEEN


461
0:32:49,369 --> 0:32:53,95
THIS SORT OF THING ON MOLDY FOOD AND SUCH.
AND IT LOOKS PRETTY


462
0:32:53,95 --> 0:32:57,659
DISGUSTING WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT IT, YOU KNOW,
JUST WITH OUR BARE


463
0:32:57,659 --> 0:33:0,33
NAKED EYES. BUT WHEN YOU GET DOWN TO THE MICROSCOPIC
LEVEL, IT'S


464
0:33:0,33 --> 0:33:4,559
INCREDIBLY NEAT. AND AS I MENTIONED, THESE
HYPHAE ARE, WELL, I


465
0:33:4,559 --> 0:33:7,599
DON'T THINK I MENTIONED THEY'RE TUBULAR FILAMENTS,
AND THEY GROW


466
0:33:7,599 --> 0:33:12,769
FROM THEIR TIPS. THEY HAVE A REALLY HIGH SURFACE
AREA TO VOLUME


467
0:33:12,769 --> 0:33:17,159
RATIO. THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT IS THEY CAN
REALLY COME INTO


468
0:33:17,159 --> 0:33:21,469
CONTACT WITH THEIR ENVIRONMENT VERY EFFICIENTLY.
THERE'S A LOT


469
0:33:21,469 --> 0:33:21,47



470
0:33:21,47 --> 0:33:24,259
OF SURFACES IN CONTACT WITH THE ENVIRONMENT.
AND THAT'S


471
0:33:24,259 --> 0:33:29,99
CRITICAL BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO DIGEST THEIR
FOOD OUTSIDE THEIR


472
0:33:29,99 --> 0:33:32,94
BODY. AND SO IT'S IN PARTS SO THEY HAVE THIS
CONTACT, THEIR


473
0:33:32,94 --> 0:33:36,929
SURFACE AREA TO VOLUME RATIO IS CRUCIAL. ENHANCES
THEIR


474
0:33:36,929 --> 0:33:43,8
ABSORPTION. AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THE MYCELIUM
IS EXTENSIVE IN


475
0:33:43,8 --> 0:33:47,69
THE CASE OF SOME OF THESE MACRO FUNGI UNDERGROUND.
WHAT WE SEE


476
0:33:47,69 --> 0:33:51,409
ON THE SURFACE IS JUST THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG.
THE VAST


477
0:33:51,409 --> 0:33:56,309
MAJORITY OF THE MYCELIUM IS NOT THE FRUITING
BODIES WHERE THE


478
0:33:56,309 --> 0:34:1,479
SPORES, THOSE SEXUAL SPORES ARE PRODUCED.
BUT THE UNDER, USUALLY


479
0:34:1,479 --> 0:34:6,289
WHAT'S IN MANY OF THESE TERRESTRIAL FUNGI,
THE SUBTERRANEAN PART


480
0:34:6,289 --> 0:34:10,76
OF THE ORGANISM THAT'S IN CONTACT WITH SUBSTRATE
THAT THEY CAN


481
0:34:10,76 --> 0:34:14,22
DIGEST. THEY'RE JUST GETTING THEIR FRUITING
BODIES HERE UP INTO


482
0:34:14,22 --> 0:34:16,81
THE ATMOSPHERE SO THEY CAN DISPERSE THEIR
SPORES. I MEAN


483
0:34:16,81 --> 0:34:24,79
TELEOLOGICALLY SPEAKING, THAT'S, THAT'S THE
END RESULT OF THAT.


484
0:34:24,79 --> 0:34:29,7
OKAY. AND HERE YOU CAN SEE THE DEVELOPMENT
OF, OF THE FRUITING


485
0:34:29,7 --> 0:34:35,13
BODY OF A TYPICAL MUSHROOM. AND THIS IS OBVIOUSLY
NOT AT THE


486
0:34:35,13 --> 0:34:42,49
TYPICAL RATE HERE. THIS IS, THIS IS ACCELERATED
GREATLY. BUT


487
0:34:42,49 --> 0:34:46,78
IT MAKES, BUT I WANT TO MAKE THE POINT THAT
THE FRUITING BODIES


488
0:34:46,78 --> 0:34:51,9
OF FUNGI CAN DEVELOP INCREDIBLY FAST. SO WHEN
THEY GO TO


489
0:34:51,9 --> 0:34:55,929
PRODUCE SEXUAL FRUITING BODIES LIKE THIS,
THEY REALLY INVEST A


490
0:34:55,929 --> 0:35:1,33
HUGE AMOUNT OF THEIR ENERGY IN THIS. AND IT'S,
IT CAN HAPPEN IN


491
0:35:1,33 --> 0:35:6,3
A MATTER OF HOURS THAT YOU CAN SEE THE EMERGENCE
OF A FRUITING


492
0:35:6,3 --> 0:35:9,52
BODY. SO IT'S BASICALLY AN OVERNIGHT PHENOMENON.
AND I THINK


493
0:35:9,52 --> 0:35:13,54
YOU PROBABLY MAYBE YOU'VE SEEN THAT IN YOUR
OWN EXPERIENCE, BUT


494
0:35:13,54 --> 0:35:21,68
IT'S A PRETTY AMAZING CAPABILITY OF FUNGI.
AND HERE JUST WE SEE


495
0:35:21,68 --> 0:35:22,36



496
0:35:22,36 --> 0:35:26,52
A LITTLE BIT OF DETAIL OF THE FUNGAL HYPHAE.
AND THERE ARE A


497
0:35:26,52 --> 0:35:29,74
COUPLE OF MAJOR TYPES OF HYPHAE THAT WE SEE,
AND THESE BREAK OUT


498
0:35:29,74 --> 0:35:33,83
PHYLOGENETICALLY. SO THERE ARE CERTAIN MAJOR
GROUPS OF FUNGI


499
0:35:33,83 --> 0:35:37,0
THAT HAVE THIS TYPE AND OTHER MAJOR GROUPS
THAT HAVE THIS TYPE.


500
0:35:37,0 --> 0:35:40,6
SO THIS IS ACTUALLY HELPFUL TO UNDERSTAND,
TO UNDERSTAND


501
0:35:40,6 --> 0:35:44,76
RELATIONSHIPS OF FUNGI TO ONE ANOTHER. SO
THERE'S ONE TYPE


502
0:35:44,76 --> 0:35:50,9
CALLED COENOCYTIC, AND THIS IS BASICALLY WHERE
THE FILAMENT IS


503
0:35:50,9 --> 0:35:56,51
COMPLETELY OPEN INSIDE. THERE ARE NO PARTITIONS,
OR SEPTAE THAT


504
0:35:56,51 --> 0:36:2,35
BREAK UP THE HYPHA INTO CELL-LIKE UNITS. THOUGH
WE HAVE AN OPEN


505
0:36:2,35 --> 0:36:9,6
CYTOPLASM INSIDE THE HYPHA AND WE HAVE THE
NUCLEI IN HERE, NOT


506
0:36:9,6 --> 0:36:15,64
SEPARATED FROM ONE ANOTHER BY CELL MEMBRANES.
THE ALTERNATIVE


507
0:36:15,64 --> 0:36:19,28
TO THAT ARE THESE SEPTATE HYPHAE WHERE YOU
CAN SEE THESE, THESE


508
0:36:19,28 --> 0:36:23,61
SEPTAE THAT, THAT DO BREAK UP THE MYC-, THE
HYPHA INTO


509
0:36:23,61 --> 0:36:26,42
PARTITIONS. BUT YOU, I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN
SEE IT FROM THE


510
0:36:26,42 --> 0:36:30,61
BACK OF THE ROOM, BUT THERE'S A LITTLE HOLE
INSIDE THESE SEPTAE


511
0:36:30,61 --> 0:36:34,17
IN THE CENTER OF THESE PARTITIONS THAT ALLOW
CYTOPLASM TO MOVE


512
0:36:34,17 --> 0:36:39,71
FREELY THROUGH, THOUGH THEY DO HAVE SOME PARTITIONING
OF LARGER


513
0:36:39,71 --> 0:36:45,36
PARTS OF THEIR CELLS LIKE THE NUCLEI HERE.
BUT THEY, CYTOPLASM


514
0:36:45,36 --> 0:36:49,31
CAN MOVE FREELY THROUGH HERE. AND SO THE HYPHA
IS STILL CAPABLE


515
0:36:49,31 --> 0:36:53,85
OF RAPIDLY MOBILIZING RESOURCES TO GROWING
PLACES. FOR EXAMPLE,


516
0:36:53,85 --> 0:36:56,54
IF THEY'RE GOING TO PRODUCE A FRUITING BODY,
THEY CAN SHUNT


517
0:36:56,54 --> 0:36:59,57
RESOURCES QUICKLY TO DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE
HYPHA.


518
0:36:59,57 --> 0:37:3,1
STUDENT: DR. BALDWIN.


519
0:37:3,1 --> 0:37:5,31
PROFESSOR: YEAH?


520
0:37:5,31 --> 0:37:7,88
STUDENT: IS THE WHOLE [INAUDIBLE]



521
0:37:7,88 --> 0:37:10,89
PROFESSOR: WELL, YEAH, WE DON'T REALLY HAVE
CELLS IN THE TYPICAL


522
0:37:10,89 --> 0:37:16,5
SENSE IN FUNGI. AND IT'S, IT'S A DIFFERENT
KIND OF SITUATION


523
0:37:16,5 --> 0:37:22,6
REALLY. YOU CAN THINK THOUGH OF EACH OF THESE
PARTITIONED-OFF


524
0:37:22,6 --> 0:37:26,78
AREAS AS CELL LIKE. THEY ARE CELL-LIKE IN
A SENSE. AND I'LL


525
0:37:26,78 --> 0:37:31,85
GET MORE TO THAT SHORTLY. SO, BUT FUNGI ARE
WEIRD. I MEAN


526
0:37:31,85 --> 0:37:35,1
JUST FACE IT, THEY'RE NOT LIKE YOU AND ME.
THEY'RE VERY


527
0:37:35,1 --> 0:37:39,12
DIFFERENT AND NOT LIKE PLANTS IN THIS REGARD.
THEY REALLY DO


528
0:37:39,12 --> 0:37:45,78
HAVE AN UNUSUAL BIOLOGY. AND THEY'RE NOT ALL
A BUNCH OF


529
0:37:45,78 --> 0:37:50,17
DECOMPOSERS LIKE YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD IN HIGH
SCHOOL BIOLOGY. I


530
0:37:50,17 --> 0:37:53,36
MEAN WE OBVIOUSLY KNOW THERE ARE SOME REALLY
HORRENDOUS PARASITES


531
0:37:53,36 --> 0:37:58,12
AS WELL. THEY ARE PARASITIC ON LIVING ORGANISMS
IN PART. BUT


532
0:37:58,12 --> 0:38:1,66
THERE ARE ACTUALLY EVEN SOME PREDATORY FUNGI.
IT'S PROBABLY


533
0:38:1,66 --> 0:38:5,13
HARD TO REALIZE THAT A FUNGUS CAN BE A PREDATOR,
AN ACTIVE


534
0:38:5,13 --> 0:38:9,83
PREDATOR, BUT THERE ARE SOME OF THESE SPECIALISTS.
AND THIS ONE


535
0:38:9,83 --> 0:38:13,44
GROUP OF ASCOMYCETES -- WE'LL GET TO THAT
PART OF THE FUNGI


536
0:38:13,44 --> 0:38:17,57
LATER -- IT'S THE MOST DIVERSE GROUP THAT
ACTUALLY PRODUCE THESE


537
0:38:17,57 --> 0:38:22,84
HYPHAL LOOPS THAT CAN ACTUALLY ACT AS NOOSES.
AND YOU CAN SEE


538
0:38:22,84 --> 0:38:28,6
HERE A HAPLESS NEMATODE IS UNFORTUNATELY GOING,
TRYING TO GET


539
0:38:28,6 --> 0:38:32,52
THROUGH ONE OF THESE HOOPS AND NOW IT'S CONSTRICTED
AROUND IT AND


540
0:38:32,52 --> 0:38:37,8
IT'S DIGESTED THEN BY THE FUNGUS. SO THERE
ARE SOME REALLY


541
0:38:37,8 --> 0:38:43,2
BIZARRE INNOVATIONS THERE. AND THEY'RE NOT
JUST DEVIOUS, RIGHT,


542
0:38:43,2 --> 0:38:48,17
THE FUNGI ARE NOT JUST DOING THINGS TO OTHER
ORGANISMS THAT ARE,


543
0:38:48,17 --> 0:38:51,38
THAT ARE NEGATIVE. THEY ALSO HAVE SOME REALLY
IMPORTANT, IN


544
0:38:51,38 --> 0:38:56,2
FACT ABSOLUTELY CRUCIAL POSITIVE INTERACTIONS
WITH OTHER


545
0:38:56,2 --> 0:39:1,9
ORGANISMS. AND THIS IS THE ONE THAT'S REALLY
FUNDAMENTAL TO


546
0:39:1,9 --> 0:39:1,9



547
0:39:1,9 --> 0:39:6,27
BASICALLY OUR SURVIVAL AS WELL AS THE SURVIVAL
OF MOST PLANTS.


548
0:39:6,27 --> 0:39:10,48
AND THAT'S WHAT'S CALLED THE MYCORRHIZAE.
MYCORRHIZAE LITERALLY


549
0:39:10,48 --> 0:39:16,4
MEANS FUNGUS ROOT. SO IT'S AN ASSOCIATION
BETWEEN A ROOT OF A


550
0:39:16,4 --> 0:39:21,96
PLANT AND FUNGUS. AND IT'S A MUTUALISM, SO
IT'S A TYPE OF


551
0:39:21,96 --> 0:39:25,86
SYMBIOTIC ASSOCIATION THAT'S ACTUALLY POSITIVE
TO BOTH PARTNERS.


552
0:39:25,86 --> 0:39:33,4
REMEMBER MUTUALISM IS BOTH PARTNERS BENEFIT,
NOT JUST ONE LIKE IN


553
0:39:33,4 --> 0:39:36,82
A COMMENSALISM. THIS IS A MUTUALISM. AND WHAT
YOU CAN SEE


554
0:39:36,82 --> 0:39:40,93
HERE IS A FUNGAL HYPHA THAT'S IN CONTACT WITH
ROOT CELLS OF A


555
0:39:40,93 --> 0:39:45,61
PLANT HERE. AND WHAT THE FUNGUS GETS OUT OF
THIS ASSOCIATION


556
0:39:45,61 --> 0:39:49,47
WITH THESE PLANT CELLS IS IT ACTUALLY GAINS
CARBOHYDRATES. IT'S


557
0:39:49,47 --> 0:39:53,5
GETTING FOOD FROM THE PLANT. AND THAT MIGHT
SEEM LIKE A BAD


558
0:39:53,5 --> 0:39:58,86
THING FOR THE PLANT, BUT THE PLANT'S GAINING
INORGANIC MINERALS


559
0:39:58,86 --> 0:40:1,92
AND SOME REALLY CRUCIAL ONES LIKE NITROGEN
AND PHOSPHORUS THAT


560
0:40:1,92 --> 0:40:5,57
ARE DIFFICULT, THAT COULD BE LIMITING IN THE
ENVIRONMENT. BUT


561
0:40:5,57 --> 0:40:9,4
THE FUNGUS IS REALLY EFFICIENT AT ABSORBING.
AND IT CAN ALSO,


562
0:40:9,4 --> 0:40:13,17
IT'S VERY EFFICIENT AT ABSORBING WATER AS
WELL, SO THE PLANT


563
0:40:13,17 --> 0:40:15,91
GETS, GETS A LOT OUT OF THIS ASSOCIATION.
AND WE KNOW THAT


564
0:40:15,91 --> 0:40:20,17
BECAUSE IF YOU, IF YOU PREVENT THIS ASSOCIATION
FROM FORMING IN


565
0:40:20,17 --> 0:40:25,12
PLANTS, THEY DO MUCH MORE POORLY IN MOST CASES.
THERE ARE SOME


566
0:40:25,12 --> 0:40:27,74
PLANTS THAT DON'T NEED THIS BUT THE VAST MAJORITY
OF PLANTS NEED


567
0:40:27,74 --> 0:40:33,97
THIS KIND OF AN ASSOCIATION. AND THERE ARE
A COUPLE OF TYPES OF


568
0:40:33,97 --> 0:40:39,82
THESE MYCORRHIZAE. ONE'S CALLED ECTOMYCORRHIZAL,
ECTO JUST


569
0:40:39,82 --> 0:40:44,51
REFERRING TO BEING OUTSIDE THE ROOT. SO THESE
ARE FUNGI THAT


570
0:40:44,51 --> 0:40:48,76
DON'T ACTUALLY PENETRATE THE INDIVIDUAL ROOT
CELLS. THEY JUST


571
0:40:48,76 --> 0:40:55,11
CLOAK THE OUTSIDE OF THE ROOT. AND THEIR HYPHAE
WILL PENETRATE


572
0:40:55,11 --> 0:40:55,11



573
0:40:55,11 --> 0:41:0,45
BETWEEN THE CELL WALLS, BUT THEY WON'T GO
INSIDE OF A CELL WALL.


574
0:41:0,45 --> 0:41:4,34
SO YOU CAN SEE HERE THE DIFFERENT CELLS OF
THE PLANT ROOT. AND


575
0:41:4,34 --> 0:41:7,74
THIS IS THE HYPHA. YOU CAN SEE IT'S BEING
INTRUDED IN HERE, BUT


576
0:41:7,74 --> 0:41:12,35
THEY'RE ONLY GOING IN THE INTERCELLULAR SPACES
BETWEEN THE CELLS,


577
0:41:12,35 --> 0:41:15,66
AND THEY'RE NOT ACTUALLY PENETRATING THE CELL
WALLS. AND WE SEE


578
0:41:15,66 --> 0:41:19,49
THESE TYPE OF FUNGI, WHICH IS A SPECIAL GROUP,
SORT OF LINEAGES,


579
0:41:19,49 --> 0:41:24,52
ASSOCIATE WITH THE ROOTS OF TREES IN TEMPERATE
OR BOREAL


580
0:41:24,52 --> 0:41:30,5
ENVIRONMENTS. SO NON-TROPICAL TREES, BOTH
CONIFERS, LIKE PINES


581
0:41:30,5 --> 0:41:33,91
AND SPRUCES AND THINGS LIKE THAT AS WELL AS
HARDWOODS LIKE


582
0:41:33,91 --> 0:41:40,16
BIRCHS, ET CETERA, OAKS, AND OTHER FLOWERING
PLANT TREES IN


583
0:41:40,16 --> 0:41:45,29
TEMPERATE REGIONS. OKAY, SO THOSE ARE THE
ECTOMYCORRHIZAL


584
0:41:45,29 --> 0:41:52,57
FUNGI. NOW THE VAST MAJORITY OF PLANTS HAVE
THIS TYPE OF


585
0:41:52,57 --> 0:41:56,8
ASSOCIATION. SO ALL THE HERBACEOUS PLANTS,
PLANTS THAT DON'T


586
0:41:56,8 --> 0:42:3,1
PRODUCE WOOD. HERBS, AND A LOT OF TROPICAL
TREES HAVE THIS TYPE


587
0:42:3,1 --> 0:42:8,76
OF ASSOCIATION CALLED AN ARBUSCULAR, WELL,
IT'S AN ARBUSCULAR


588
0:42:8,76 --> 0:42:12,6
MYCORRHIZAE FORMED FROM ARBUSCULAR MYCORRHIZAL
FUNGI. REMEMBER


589
0:42:12,6 --> 0:42:16,71
THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN THE PLANT AND THE
FUNGUS IS CALLED THE


590
0:42:16,71 --> 0:42:22,15
MYCORRHIZAE OR MYCHORRHIZA, SINGULAR. AND
WE CALL THE FUNGI BY


591
0:42:22,15 --> 0:42:26,81
THAT NAME, MYCORRHIZAL FUNGUS BECAUSE ONLY
PARTICULAR FUNGI WILL


592
0:42:26,81 --> 0:42:31,52
HAVE THESE TYPES OF ASSOCIATIONS WITH PLANTS.
AND HERE YOU CAN


593
0:42:31,52 --> 0:42:37,7
SEE THAT THE FUNGAL HYPHA NOT ONLY GOES IN
BETWEEN THE ROOT CELLS


594
0:42:37,7 --> 0:42:42,37
OF THE PLANT BUT ALSO PENETRATES THE CELL
WALL. SO HERE YOU CAN


595
0:42:42,37 --> 0:42:47,41
SEE THIS WEIRD TREE-LIKE BRANCHING PATTERN
OF THE FUNGAL HYPHA


596
0:42:47,41 --> 0:42:52,33
WHERE IT'S COMING INTO CONTACT WITH THE CELL
MEMBRANE. AND YOU


597
0:42:52,33 --> 0:42:57,52
CAN SEE THIS REALLY DENSE AREA HERE WHERE
THESE DENDRITIC OR


598
0:42:57,52 --> 0:42:57,52



599
0:42:57,52 --> 0:43:2,71
TREE-LIKE BRANCHING PATTERNS OF THE FUNGAL
HYPHA ARE IN CONTACT


600
0:43:2,71 --> 0:43:6,56
WITH THE ACTUAL CELL MEMBRANE OF THE PLANT.
SO THEY PENETRATE


601
0:43:6,56 --> 0:43:9,37
THE CELL WALL, AND THEN THEY'RE COVERING THE
OUTSIDE OF THE CELL


602
0:43:9,37 --> 0:43:11,48
MEMBRANE. THEY'RE NOT PENETRATING THE CELL
MEMBRANE OF THE


603
0:43:11,48 --> 0:43:14,91
PLANT CELL. THEY'RE NOT PUNCTURING IT. THEY'RE
JUST COVERING


604
0:43:14,91 --> 0:43:19,51
IT. AND SO THEY HAVE A LOT BETTER CONTACT
AREA WITH THE PLANT.


605
0:43:19,51 --> 0:43:24,74
AND THERE'S A LOT MORE SURFACING CONTACT HERE
FOR TRANSFERRING


606
0:43:24,74 --> 0:43:29,12
SUBSTANCES. SO THAT'S THE MORE COMMON ASSOCIATION.
AND WE SEE


607
0:43:29,12 --> 0:43:32,75
THIS IN, THIS TYPE OF ASSOCIATION IN MORE
THAN 80 PERCENT OF


608
0:43:32,75 --> 0:43:36,68
PLANT FAMILIES, INCLUDING SOME OF THE EARLIEST
DIVERGING PLANT


609
0:43:36,68 --> 0:43:42,69
FAMILIES. SO THESE GUYS WERE PROBABLY CRITICAL
TO THE ORIGINAL


610
0:43:42,69 --> 0:43:48,39
COLONIZATION OF LAND BY PLANTS, OF TERRESTRIAL
PLANTS. AND SO


611
0:43:48,39 --> 0:43:51,67
THE MYCORRHI-, THIS PARTICULAR GROUP IS ACTUALLY
JUST A FEW,


612
0:43:51,67 --> 0:43:54,1
THERE'S ONLY A COUPLE HUNDRED SPECIES OF THESE
TYPES OF FUNGI


613
0:43:54,1 --> 0:43:59,37
THAT WE KNOW OF TODAY, BUT THEY'RE REALLY
IMPORTANT. AND HERE


614
0:43:59,37 --> 0:44:5,59
YOU CAN JUST SEE A CARTOON OF THIS TREE-LIKE
DENDRITIC PATTERN OF


615
0:44:5,59 --> 0:44:9,59
THE FUNGAL HYPHA. AND IT'S SORT OF, IT HASN'T
PUNCTURED THE


616
0:44:9,59 --> 0:44:13,2
CELL MEMBRANE HERE. YOU CAN SEE THE CELL MEMBRANE
OF THE PLANT


617
0:44:13,2 --> 0:44:16,51
ROOT JUST RUNNING ALONG THE OUTSIDE THERE.
SO IT'S JUST SORT OF


618
0:44:16,51 --> 0:44:26,23
LIKE STICKING ITS, ITS FINGERS INTO, INTO
SORT OF [INAUDIBLE]


619
0:44:26,23 --> 0:44:30,0
LIKE SITUATION WHERE IT'S NOT PUNCTURING BUT
JUST GETTING IN


620
0:44:30,0 --> 0:44:36,14
CONTACT. OKAY, SO A LITTLE BIT OF TIME LEFT.
I JUST WANT TO


621
0:44:36,14 --> 0:44:40,97
INTRODUCE YOU TO THE FIVE MAJOR GROUPS OF
FUNGI. FOUR OF THESE


622
0:44:40,97 --> 0:44:43,77
WE ACTUALLY RECOGNIZED IN THE PAST. BUT ONE
OF THESE THAT WE


623
0:44:43,77 --> 0:44:50,7
DIDN'T UNTIL DNA EVIDENCE. AND YOU CAN SEE
THAT THE FUNGI FORM A


624
0:44:50,7 --> 0:44:50,7



625
0:44:50,7 --> 0:44:53,59
MONOPHYLETIC GROUP. SO HERE'S THE ROOT OF
THE FUNGAL TREE RIGHT


626
0:44:53,59 --> 0:44:57,56
HERE. IT'S LAYING ON ITS SIDE. AND THESE ARE
THE FIVE TERMINAL


627
0:44:57,56 --> 0:45:4,82
GROUPS WITH EXAMPLES OUT HERE. WE HAVE TWO
MAJOR CLADES OF BIG


628
0:45:4,82 --> 0:45:8,2
MACRO FUNGI THAT PRODUCE THESE BIG FRUITING
BODIES THAT ARE


629
0:45:8,2 --> 0:45:12,99
SISTER TO EACH OTHER, THE ASCOMYCOTA AND THE
BASIDIOMYCOTA, THESE


630
0:45:12,99 --> 0:45:17,35
BEING THE TRUE MUSHROOMS. AND THESE BEING
THE SAC FUNGI. I'LL


631
0:45:17,35 --> 0:45:21,72
SHOW YOU SOME MORE EXAMPLES IN A MINUTE. THESE
ARE THE ONES


632
0:45:21,72 --> 0:45:25,94
YOU'RE PROBABLY FAMILIAR WITH. AND THEN I'LL
TALK ABOUT THESE


633
0:45:25,94 --> 0:45:31,3
IN A MOMENT HERE. THIS INCLUDES MOST BUT NOT
ALL THE ORGANISMS


634
0:45:31,3 --> 0:45:33,75
THAT HAVE BEEN BEEN CALLED FUNGI IN THE PAST.
AND YOU'RE GOING


635
0:45:33,75 --> 0:45:37,89
TO SEE SOME THINGS IN LAB THIS COMING WEEK
THAT ARE THINGS WE


636
0:45:37,89 --> 0:45:41,22
USED TO THINK WERE FUNGI BUT TURN OUT NOT
TO BE. BUT THEY HAVE


637
0:45:41,22 --> 0:45:48,3
KIND OF SIMILAR LIFESTYLES. SO HERE'S THE
SISTER GROUP. A


638
0:45:48,3 --> 0:45:51,58
CHYTRIDIOMYCOTA, THESE ARE ORGANISMS THAT
HAVE BEEN CALLED


639
0:45:51,58 --> 0:45:55,63
CHYTRIDS. THAT'S THE SHORTHAND NAME. AND THERE
ARE ONLY ABOUT


640
0:45:55,63 --> 0:46:1,72
A THOUSAND SPECIES OF THESE COMPARED TO LIKE
65,000 OF THESE AND


641
0:46:1,72 --> 0:46:6,3
ABOUT 30,000 OF THESE. SO REALLY SMALL DIVERSITY.
BUT THEY'RE


642
0:46:6,3 --> 0:46:8,28
VERY INTERESTING BECAUSE THEY'RE ONE OF THE
EARLY DIVERGING


643
0:46:8,28 --> 0:46:11,41
LINEAGES HERE. AND IT WAS QUESTIONABLE WHETHER
THEY WERE EVEN


644
0:46:11,41 --> 0:46:14,71
REALLY FUNGI IN THE PAST, BUT THE MOLECULAR
DATA REALLY NAILED


645
0:46:14,71 --> 0:46:21,46
THAT DOWN. AND HERE YOU CAN SEE SOME OF THESE
CHYTRIDS.


646
0:46:21,46 --> 0:46:23,86
THEY'RE REALLY INTERESTING BECAUSE THEY'RE
THE ONLY GROUP OF


647
0:46:23,86 --> 0:46:30,62
FUNGI THAT HAS SPORES AND GAMETES THAT CAN
ACTUALLY MOVE AROUND


648
0:46:30,62 --> 0:46:35,2
WITH FLAGELLAE THAT HAVE A SINGLE FLAGELLUM,
WHIP-LIKE FLAGELLUM.


649
0:46:35,2 --> 0:46:39,6
AND IN THAT REGARD THEY'RE REALLY SIMILAR
TO SOME OF THE CLOSE


650
0:46:39,6 --> 0:46:39,19



651
0:46:39,19 --> 0:46:43,9
RELATIVES OF THE ANIMALS, AND UNICELLULAR
FORMS I SHOULD SAY.


652
0:46:43,9 --> 0:46:50,46
THEY, THIS WHIP-LIKE FLAGELLUM IS SOMETHING
THEY SHARE WITH A


653
0:46:50,46 --> 0:46:55,54
COMMON ANCESTOR WITH THE ANIMALS. SO IN THE
BROAD SENSE THIS BIG


654
0:46:55,54 --> 0:47:0,55
FUNGAL ANIMAL GROUP ARE CALLED THE UNIKONTS
WHICH IS NOT A NAME


655
0:47:0,55 --> 0:47:3,93
YOU HAVE TO KNOW BUT IT MEANS BASICALLY HAVING
A SINGLE WHIP-LIKE


656
0:47:3,93 --> 0:47:7,87
FLAGELLUM. AND WE SEE THAT IN THESE CHYTRID
ZOOSPORES. AND


657
0:47:7,87 --> 0:47:12,2
HERE YOU CAN SEE A LITTLE ANIMATION OR IT'S
NOT ANIMATION, THIS


658
0:47:12,2 --> 0:47:15,16
IS ACTUALLY REAL LIFE. YOU CAN SEE ONE OF
THESE SWIMMING


659
0:47:15,16 --> 0:47:17,46
ZOOSPORES. AND THEY CAN REALLY GET IT ON.
THEY CAN REALLY MOVE


660
0:47:17,46 --> 0:47:20,87
FAST. YOU CAN SEE THEM MOVING. I MEAN YOU
HAVE A HARD TIME


661
0:47:20,87 --> 0:47:25,87
KEEPING THEM IN THE FIELD OF VIEW UNDER A
MICROSCOPE. AND HERE


662
0:47:25,87 --> 0:47:28,22
YOU CAN SEE THEY'RE BEING EXUDED OUT OF THE
TIP OF THIS


663
0:47:28,22 --> 0:47:32,5
SPORANGIUM HERE. THERE'S ONE BEING EXUDED
OUT. AND AS SOON AS


664
0:47:32,5 --> 0:47:35,78
THEY'RE RELEASED, THEY TAKE OFF AT TOP SPEED.
AND THEN THEY CAN


665
0:47:35,78 --> 0:47:43,64
SETTLE DOWN ONTO THE ENVIRONMENT, PRODUCE
THESE HYPHAE, AND THEN


666
0:47:43,64 --> 0:47:46,3
A SPORANGIUM. SO THEY CAN, SOME OF THESE HAVE
A REALLY SIMPLE


667
0:47:46,3 --> 0:47:50,48
LIFE CYCLE. OTHERS PRODUCE BIG FILAMENTS.
YOU CAN SEE ONE OF


668
0:47:50,48 --> 0:47:58,3
THESE HERE. THIS IS ALLOMYCES. AND THE CHYTRIDS
ARE REALLY


669
0:47:58,3 --> 0:48:1,13
IMPORTANT ECOLOGICALLY FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS.
THEY'RE IN THE


670
0:48:1,13 --> 0:48:4,12
SOIL. THEY'RE IMPORTANT TO DECOMPOSERS. THEY'RE
IN AQUATIC


671
0:48:4,12 --> 0:48:9,1
SITUATIONS. THEY'RE IMPORTANT THERE. SOME
OF THEM ARE IMPORTANT


672
0:48:9,1 --> 0:48:12,34
IN THE GUTS OF RUMINANTS, LIKE I MENTIONED
THE METHANOGEN


673
0:48:12,34 --> 0:48:16,28
BACTER-, OR ARCHAEA. SOME OF THEM ARE IMPORTANT
AS DIGEST-, IN


674
0:48:16,28 --> 0:48:20,43
THE DIGESTIVE TRACTS OF UNGULATES. BUT YOU
PROBABLY HAVE HEARD


675
0:48:20,43 --> 0:48:23,7
ABOUT THEM IF IN ANY REGARD BECAUSE THEY'RE
ONE OF THE MAIN


676
0:48:23,7 --> 0:48:23,81



677
0:48:23,81 --> 0:48:27,84
FACTORS IN AMPHIBIAN DECLINE WORLDWIDE. AND
THIS WASN'T A


678
0:48:27,84 --> 0:48:32,13
PHENOMENON THAT WE KNEW ABOUT UNTIL FAIRLY
RECENTLY, OVER THE


679
0:48:32,13 --> 0:48:38,15
LAST 10, 20 YEARS. THIS PHENOMENON OF CHYTRIDIOMYCOSIS.
THIS


680
0:48:38,15 --> 0:48:42,43
CHYTRID INFECTION OF PARTICULARLY FROGS AND
TOADS HAS LEAD TO THE


681
0:48:42,43 --> 0:48:48,22
EXTINCTION AND RAPID DEMISE OF LOTS OF ANURANS
WORLDWIDE. AND


682
0:48:48,22 --> 0:48:51,46
IT'S A REALLY SERIOUS DISEASE THAT'S SPREAD
INTO CALIFORNIA AND


683
0:48:51,46 --> 0:48:55,34
OTHER PLACES FAMILIAR TO US. AND IT'S BEEN
A HUGE PROBLEM TO


684
0:48:55,34 --> 0:48:58,8
ORGANISMS THAT ARE ALREADY HAVING PLENTY OF
TROUBLE. SO THESE


685
0:48:58,8 --> 0:49:3,27
CAN BE A REALLY AGGRESSIVE PATHOGENS, PATHOGENIC
DISEASE-CAUSING


686
0:49:3,27 --> 0:49:10,57
ORGANISMS. OKAY, SO WE'RE OUT OF TIME. BUT
NEXT TIME WE'LL


687
0:49:10,57 --> 0:49:12,91
GET INTO THE REST OF THESE FUNGI, TALK A LITTLE
BIT ABOUT THEIR


688
0:49:12,91 --> 0:49:20,51
LIFE CYCLE. SO HAPPY HALLOWEEN. SEE YOU MONDAY.
OR IN


689
0:49:20,51 --> 0:49:21,17
OFFICE HOURS.
