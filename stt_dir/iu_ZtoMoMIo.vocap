###0 SAM BARCLAY: Ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls,
###1 hello and welcome.
###2 This is the Smoke's Poutinerie third annual World Poutine
###7 Eating Championships.
###8 There is no bigger stage in all of world sports.
###11 No one denies this.
###12 
###16 My name is Sam Barclay.
###17 I'm from Major League Eating.
###19 We are the world body that governs and sanctions all
###22 stomach centric sports.
###23 And coming up in a matter of moments, on that very stage,
###28 is the Smoke's Poutinerie third annual World Poutine
###31 Eating Championships.
###32 There is no bigger stage in all of world sports.
###35 TIM JANUS: My name is Tim Janus.
###36 They call me Eater X. I'm the number three ranked
###39 competitive eater on the planet, and I'm here for the
###41 Smoke's Poutinerie World Poutine Eating Championship.
###45 I didn't do a lot for this contest, mainly because we
###48 don't have a Smoke's Poutinerie in New York City.
###51 If you're going to practice, which we don't do very much
###53 anyways, it really helps to have the exact food you're
###56 going to be eating in the contest.
###57 I think we're going to be duking it out.
###59 It's a capacity contest, but speed is the name of the game.
###63 It's a very quick food, so at the end it's going to come
###65 down to who has more room left.
###67 And we're all pretty big eaters in that sense.
###71 JIM REEVES: Hi.
###71 My name is Jim Reeves from Buffalo, New York.
###73 They just call me Buffalo Jim Reeves.
###75 I love this contest.
###76 I've done it all three years.
###77 This will be my third year doing it.
###78 I'm currently ranked number 18 in the world.
###80 I'm the current world record holder over watermelon.
###82 I've eaten 13.22 pounds of watermelon in 15 minutes.
###85 I'm pork rind eating champion of the world, 50 hamburgers in
###88 8 minutes and 100 whole jalapenos in 8 minutes.
###91 The first National Buffalo Wing Festival, 10 years ago,
###93 my brother-in-law was in from out of town, he
###95 dared me to do it.
###96 I did it.
###96 I did pretty well.
###97 Poutine is one of the most difficult foods to eat,
###99 absolutely.
###100 People don't think so, because everybody loves french fries,
###102 but the reality of it is they're really pasty.
###104 And when you try eating them fast, all that dryness and all
###107 that pastiness starts to gum up your mouth, just like
###109 peanut butter does.
###110 So it's actually more difficult than eating hot dogs
###112 or hamburgers.
###113 BOB SHOUDT: My name's Bob Shoudt, Notorious BOB.
###116 Most people go for the gold stuff.
###118 This is real pine, though, I went for pine.
###121 I've always been eating in eating contests all my life.
###123 I'm 45 years old.
###124 Once you start getting money to eat, you keep eating and
###128 keep getting money.
###129 This is a cool trophy here.
###131 So you want to get your picture
###133 taken with that trophy.
###134 It kicks ass.
###135 You've seen the trophy, you know it kicks ass.
###138 LARELL MARIE MELE: My name is Larell Marie
###139 The Real Deal Mele.
###140 I'm ranked number 30 in the world of MLE.
###143 I think now that women are more aware of competitive
###146 eating it's becoming a lot more equal field.
###149 It's not just the men anymore.
###150 The women are having equal opportunity and awareness.
###154 So it's not become disgusting anymore.
###156 It's something cool to be doing.
###158 And especially if you can beat some of the
###159 guys, it's even better.
###161 MICAH COLLINS: They call me Wing Kong, or the Candyman.
###163 I am from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.
###165 I'm 13th in the world right now.
###166 It started as a bad joke and a lot of beer.
###169 I actually hold the world baked bean record--
###171 5 pounds, 4 ounces in 58 seconds.
###174 This morning I did about nine pounds of cabbage with about a
###177 gallon of water, so that flushed everything through and
###181 I feel great.
###182 I'm ready to go.
###182 I'm stretched out and ready.
###184 
###193 SAM BARCLAY: Let the contest begin.
###196 
###233 TIM JANUS: I tied for second today.
###236 I'm happy.
###237 I feel like I could eat more.
###239 It's great poutine.
###240 I was a little conservative with the water, so I have a
###243 lot of space left.
###244 But I'm happy with the results.
###245 It was a good contest.
###246 BOB SHOUDT: Second place.
###247 I'm proud of that.
###248 It's a good contest.
###249 I really wanted to be next to that trophy at the end, but
###252 it's something to shoot for next year year.
###254 I have to stay hungry and focused and come
###255 back strong next year.
###256 JOEY CHESTNUT: I'm Joey Chestnut, world champion
###257 competitive eater, ranked number one in the world.
###260 Today I was able to come out champion of the poutine eating
###262 championships and dominate the field and take home the
###265 poutine eating title to California.
###267 Today I was just eating with my left hand.
###270 If I had to drink something I would drink with my right.
###273 But I'm left handed, so I was doing all my real eating work
###274 with my left hand.
###276 And I just try to get into a rhythm.
###278 You get into a rhythm, breathe, swallow, do the same
###280 thing over and over again.
###281 I had somebody behind me, yelling at me, coaching me,
###284 yelling at me every time I slowed down,
###285 which always helps.
###286 Besides some awesome trophies, I'm walking away with two
###289 grand cash.
###290 
###292 Even if there was no cash involved, I'd love to come
###294 here and win it again.
###295
