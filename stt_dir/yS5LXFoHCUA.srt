0:0:2,7 --> 0:0:5,7
<i>You asked out a girl</i>
<i>stuck in an MRI machine</i>


2
0:0:5,7 --> 0:0:7,87
<i>without ever seeing her face,</i>


3
0:0:7,87 --> 0:0:9,327
<i>Remember no matter</i>
<i>what she looks like</i>


4
0:0:9,327 --> 0:0:12,607
<i>be sure to play it cool,</i>


5
0:0:12,607 --> 0:0:14,367
Yes!


6
0:0:14,367 --> 0:0:16,847
Yes! You are smokin' hot!


7
0:0:16,847 --> 0:0:20,527
ln your face!


8
0:0:20,527 --> 0:0:23,767
<i>That night we went out</i>
<i>on our first date,</i>


9
0:0:23,767 --> 0:0:27,927
<i>Had our first dinner,</i>


10
0:0:27,927 --> 0:0:31,927
<i>Rented our first movie,</i>


11
0:0:31,927 --> 0:0:34,127
<i>Took our first long drive,</i>


12
0:0:34,127 --> 0:0:36,247
Look out!


13
0:0:36,247 --> 0:0:38,407
<i>Killed our first raccoon,</i>


14
0:0:38,407 --> 0:0:47,527
<i>Ever since then every date we've</i>
<i>been on has always ended the same way,</i>


15
0:0:47,527 --> 0:0:49,47
No!


16
0:0:49,47 --> 0:0:51,527
Cox wants me back at the hospital.


17
0:0:51,527 --> 0:0:59,807
- But the page is addressed to Lillian.
- That's me.


18
0:0:59,807 --> 0:1:3,407
<i>What a drag,</i>


19
0:1:3,407 --> 0:1:19,967
<i>That was probably the wrong time</i>
<i>to ask for a quickie,</i>


20
0:1:19,967 --> 0:1:22,127
l have been coerced


21
0:1:22,127 --> 0:1:25,647
by the forces of evil into
conducting rounds this morning.


22
0:1:25,647 --> 0:1:27,847
Why do you have to do rounds?


23
0:1:27,847 --> 0:1:30,287
Because l'm sleepy. How's that?


24
0:1:30,287 --> 0:1:33,7
To make this a more
palatable experience for <i>moi</i>


25
0:1:33,7 --> 0:1:36,847
l am not going to call you by
your names. l'll be referring to you


26
0:1:36,847 --> 0:1:40,647
by whatever distinguishing physical
characteristic occurs to me.


27
0:1:40,647 --> 0:1:42,927
You, Chicken Beak.


28
0:1:42,927 --> 0:1:46,247
What causes pneumonia
presenting with diarrhoea?


29
0:1:46,247 --> 0:1:48,47
- Legionella.
- Nice job.


30
0:1:48,47 --> 0:1:51,687
lt turns out your mind's
just as sharp as your nose.


31
0:1:51,687 --> 0:1:53,807
And you, Dye Job.


32
0:1:53,807 --> 0:1:58,247
What are the elements
of Whipple's triad?


33
0:1:58,247 --> 0:2:6,887
<i>It's hard to describe how scary</i>
<i>it is when you don't know an answer,</i>


34
0:2:6,887 --> 0:2:9,967
l can't remember. l am so sorry.


35
0:2:9,967 --> 0:2:12,167
What are you sorry about?


36
0:2:12,167 --> 0:2:14,527
Dr Kelso yells at us
when we don't know...


37
0:2:14,527 --> 0:2:15,967
Children,


38
0:2:15,967 --> 0:2:19,247
you can't let that bloated bag
of hate affect you.


39
0:2:19,247 --> 0:2:23,847
Being a doctor is as much about
finding the answers as knowing them.


40
0:2:23,847 --> 0:2:27,87
For instance, take Clarabelle's
patient here, Mr Yeager.


41
0:2:27,87 --> 0:2:29,367
We have no idea what's wrong with him.


42
0:2:29,367 --> 0:2:35,607
So we have run tests for everything
and according to these results...


43
0:2:35,607 --> 0:2:38,927
Everything seems
to have come back negative.


44
0:2:38,927 --> 0:2:42,887
Which doesn't necessarily mean
that Clarabelle is a failure.


45
0:2:42,887 --> 0:2:45,887
lt just means
that she's got to keep trying,


46
0:2:45,887 --> 0:2:48,727
no matter how frustrated she might get.


47
0:2:48,727 --> 0:2:52,7
Now, of course, if you
are lazy and incompetent,


48
0:2:52,7 --> 0:2:56,7
then, yes, that will buy you
a one-way ticket out of here.


49
0:2:56,7 --> 0:2:57,767
Doug.


50
0:2:57,767 --> 0:3:2,247
Listen carefully. Kelso can't do a thing
to you if you answer a question wrong.


51
0:3:2,247 --> 0:3:6,927
lt doesn't work that way. Moving on.
Not you. You still have work to do.


52
0:3:6,927 --> 0:3:12,767
Johnny No-Tan? l'd like you to
present the next patient to me.


53
0:3:12,767 --> 0:3:14,847
l love you.


54
0:3:14,847 --> 0:3:16,567
Now say it in Spanish.


55
0:3:16,567 --> 0:3:18,367
<i>Te amo,</i>


56
0:3:18,367 --> 0:3:21,47
Now... say it like Astro.


57
0:3:21,47 --> 0:3:26,407
l ruv roo.


58
0:3:26,407 --> 0:3:30,127
- You are very, very cute.
- l know.


59
0:3:30,127 --> 0:3:33,127
l've been thinking
about this ''l love you'' thing.


60
0:3:33,127 --> 0:3:35,887
lt's gonna make
everything so much better.


61
0:3:35,887 --> 0:3:39,527
l mean, we're so in sync.
Better conversation,


62
0:3:39,527 --> 0:3:43,47
better dancing...


63
0:3:43,47 --> 0:3:44,647
And?


64
0:3:44,647 --> 0:3:49,247
Way better shrumpdown.


65
0:3:49,247 --> 0:4:5,167
Yeah!


66
0:4:5,167 --> 0:4:12,647
l'm so sorry. That has never
happened to me before.


67
0:4:12,647 --> 0:4:15,47
<i>Man she's beautiful,</i>


68
0:4:15,47 --> 0:4:18,607
<i>I wish I was that piece of bacon,</i>
<i>Wait a second,</i>


69
0:4:18,607 --> 0:4:20,167
<i>I am that piece of bacon,</i>


70
0:4:20,167 --> 0:4:21,967
That's right.


71
0:4:21,967 --> 0:4:25,407
You mind not staring at me
while l'm eating?


72
0:4:25,407 --> 0:4:27,7
l hate it.


73
0:4:27,7 --> 0:4:29,407
- But l'm not.
- What am l doing right now?


74
0:4:29,407 --> 0:4:31,527
- Eating.
- What are you doing?


75
0:4:31,527 --> 0:4:38,487
Staring.


76
0:4:38,487 --> 0:4:41,207
There. Now no one gets to eat it.


77
0:4:41,207 --> 0:4:50,167
- You happy?
- Not really.


78
0:4:50,167 --> 0:4:52,327
You know what's great?


79
0:4:52,327 --> 0:4:55,607
Even when our dates get interrupted,
we can have a date here.


80
0:4:55,607 --> 0:4:58,327
Let's say
you wanted to watch a movie.


81
0:4:58,327 --> 0:5:2,87
We could go to the conference room
and watch that video on STDs.


82
0:5:2,87 --> 0:5:4,567
lt's funny and it makes you think.


83
0:5:4,567 --> 0:5:8,247
Maybe it would be good
if we actually had a date that


84
0:5:8,247 --> 0:5:11,647
- ends.
- How does a date with you end?


85
0:5:11,647 --> 0:5:13,927
lt can range from a kiss at the door


86
0:5:13,927 --> 0:5:17,727
to ''all l have for breakfast
is yoghurt and l'm out of bowls,


87
0:5:17,727 --> 0:5:20,647
so you'll have to eat off my stomach.''


88
0:5:20,647 --> 0:5:23,167
Tonight. Dinner. Hyde's.


89
0:5:23,167 --> 0:5:29,247
lt's a date.


90
0:5:29,247 --> 0:5:31,847
Judging from the ataxia dysarthria,


91
0:5:31,847 --> 0:5:35,847
l've concluded that Mr Yeager
is suffering from... kuru.


92
0:5:35,847 --> 0:5:37,607
- Kuru?
- Kuru.


93
0:5:37,607 --> 0:5:39,407
- Kuru?
- Yes, kuru.


94
0:5:39,407 --> 0:5:42,407
- l'd actually never thought of that.
- Hell, yeah.


95
0:5:42,407 --> 0:5:45,647
Were you aware that the only
documented cases of kuru


96
0:5:45,647 --> 0:5:48,767
were members of a cannibalistic tribe
in Papua New Guinea?


97
0:5:48,767 --> 0:5:51,367
- l was not.
- Actually, doc,


98
0:5:51,367 --> 0:5:53,407
l was in New Guinea last week.


99
0:5:53,407 --> 0:5:55,927
- Really?
- No.


100
0:5:55,927 --> 0:6:0,327
- Do you happen to know what a zebra is?
- He just mocked me.


101
0:6:0,327 --> 0:6:3,407
lt's a diagnosis of an obscure disease


102
0:6:3,407 --> 0:6:8,607
when it's more likely to be a common
illness with uncommon symptoms.


103
0:6:8,607 --> 0:6:11,687
ln other words,
if you hear hoof beats,


104
0:6:11,687 --> 0:6:15,767
you just go ahead
and think horsies, not zebras.


105
0:6:15,767 --> 0:6:23,607
Mm-kay, Mr Silly Bear?


106
0:6:23,607 --> 0:6:25,687
- What's wrong?
- lt's personal.


107
0:6:25,687 --> 0:6:28,247
Why won't you ever open up to me?
l came to you


108
0:6:28,247 --> 0:6:32,487
when l thought l had a broken tailbone
and it was just a really bad pimple.


109
0:6:32,487 --> 0:6:35,407
lt's a sex thing. OK?


110
0:6:35,407 --> 0:6:41,607
Like a gender issue or like intercourse?
Because l'm book-smart on both.


111
0:6:41,607 --> 0:6:48,647
Carla? Use me.


112
0:6:48,647 --> 0:6:51,807
- Last night, when l was with Carla...
- Dude, l can't talk.


113
0:6:51,807 --> 0:6:54,367
l gotta figure this Mr Yeager thing out.


114
0:6:54,367 --> 0:6:57,167
Cool.


115
0:6:57,167 --> 0:6:59,367
My horse didn't finish the race.


116
0:6:59,367 --> 0:7:2,407
l'm at the filling station,
but my credit card's declined.


117
0:7:2,407 --> 0:7:4,367
- l'm on the jet ski...
- l got it!


118
0:7:4,367 --> 0:7:8,287
- Good. l had no idea what to say...
- No. Mr Yeager.


119
0:7:8,287 --> 0:7:12,207
Where you go...?
Who am l going to talk to about sex?


120
0:7:12,207 --> 0:7:15,327
Let's get our talk on.


121
0:7:15,327 --> 0:7:17,887
Player to player.


122
0:7:17,887 --> 0:7:20,967
<i>Afternoon rounds</i>
<i>that day began like any other,</i>


123
0:7:20,967 --> 0:7:25,887
This patient is hypoglycaemic. What
are the signs of an insulinoma, Dr Reid?


124
0:7:25,887 --> 0:7:27,567
Elevated C-peptide levels.


125
0:7:27,567 --> 0:7:31,167
Score! But before you do
your crazy end-zone dance,


126
0:7:31,167 --> 0:7:34,527
tell me the spinal fluid findings
in Guillaume-BarrÃ© syndrome.


127
0:7:34,527 --> 0:7:37,87
- Xanthochromia?
- Wrong!


128
0:7:37,87 --> 0:7:41,487
<i>And then it happened, Suddenly</i>
<i>Dr Kelso didn't seem as frightening,</i>


129
0:7:41,487 --> 0:7:45,247
Dr Reid, what do you
have to say for yourself?


130
0:7:45,247 --> 0:7:47,287
Win some, lose some.


131
0:7:47,287 --> 0:7:53,327
<i>In fact nothing he did</i>
<i>seemed to scare us,</i>


132
0:7:53,327 --> 0:7:57,647
<i>Not any more,</i>


133
0:7:57,647 --> 0:8:4,407
<i>Not even the most horrible thing</i>
<i>he could think of,</i>


134
0:8:4,407 --> 0:8:7,727
All right, welcome to the lCU!
No, really, sit down.


135
0:8:7,727 --> 0:8:11,527
For women that don't know how to cook.
l put the Yellow Pages in there.


136
0:8:11,527 --> 0:8:15,727
What do you want? Mexican? ltalian?
Japanese? American cuisine?


137
0:8:15,727 --> 0:8:20,447
lt's a cook...
l'm flat-linin'. Beep!


138
0:8:20,447 --> 0:8:21,967
Save him!


139
0:8:21,967 --> 0:8:26,447
Tip your nurses.


140
0:8:26,447 --> 0:8:30,927
<i>And I think he knew</i>
<i>who was behind it,</i>


141
0:8:30,927 --> 0:8:34,807
Cox.


142
0:8:34,807 --> 0:8:40,247
<i>Talk to me</i>


143
0:8:40,247 --> 0:8:43,447
You know,
that's really getting annoying.


144
0:8:43,447 --> 0:8:49,647
Every time you say it, it makes me
not want to talk to you all the more.


145
0:8:49,647 --> 0:8:52,567
<i>Talk to me</i>


146
0:8:52,567 --> 0:8:58,847
All right, fine!


147
0:8:58,847 --> 0:9:2,647
Last night, Turk and l were,
you know, messin' around.


148
0:9:2,647 --> 0:9:7,207
- lt's really hot, like always.
- Hot like how? Describe it.


149
0:9:7,207 --> 0:9:9,207
Dude!


150
0:9:9,207 --> 0:9:13,367
So suddenly, things aren't happening.
You know what l mean?


151
0:9:13,367 --> 0:9:17,327
The only change is that we said
''l love you'' to each other.


152
0:9:17,327 --> 0:9:18,767
lt's true.


153
0:9:18,767 --> 0:9:22,967
l have never said ''l love you''
to a woman before.


154
0:9:22,967 --> 0:9:25,167
Then how do you
get them to sleep with you?


155
0:9:25,167 --> 0:9:29,407
lt's three little words.
lt shouldn't have this effect, right?


156
0:9:29,407 --> 0:9:34,767
Anyway, l told him it wasn't his fault.
These things happen occasionally.


157
0:9:34,767 --> 0:9:36,847
Try constantly.


158
0:9:36,847 --> 0:9:41,767
l have cold hands, and...


159
0:9:41,767 --> 0:9:45,727
So when l saw you this morning
and l said ''How's your penis?''


160
0:9:45,727 --> 0:9:49,807
and you didn't wanna talk about it...


161
0:9:49,807 --> 0:9:52,407
Dude. lt's not me.


162
0:9:52,407 --> 0:9:54,487
lt's me.


163
0:9:54,487 --> 0:9:57,727
Last night, for the first time
ever in our relationship,


164
0:9:57,727 --> 0:9:59,647
no matter how long we tried,


165
0:9:59,647 --> 0:10:9,847
l was unable to have an...


166
0:10:9,847 --> 0:10:13,967
Dr Cox, l got the sed rate back
on Mr Yeager. Say ''how do'' to that.


167
0:10:13,967 --> 0:10:16,407
But then
l'm due back at the hootenanny.


168
0:10:16,407 --> 0:10:20,207
l noticed he had a rash. l realised
he's been having jaw claudication,


169
0:10:20,207 --> 0:10:22,767
- which led me to...
- Temporal arteritis.


170
0:10:22,767 --> 0:10:27,767
Of course. Nurse, start Mr Yeager on
solumedrol and get the surgery resident?


171
0:10:27,767 --> 0:10:30,127
He needs a temporal
artery biopsy stat.


172
0:10:30,127 --> 0:10:32,407
Newbie, l can handle this.


173
0:10:32,407 --> 0:10:34,727
- You're off, aren't you?
- l'm with you.


174
0:10:34,727 --> 0:10:37,487
Fair enough.
Let's go treat the patient.


175
0:10:37,487 --> 0:10:47,327
<i>I am so on top of things tonight</i>
<i>it's scary,</i>


176
0:10:47,327 --> 0:10:51,487
Hell, yeah.


177
0:10:51,487 --> 0:10:54,447
<i>You're only 80 minutes late,</i>
<i>She'll still be here,</i>


178
0:10:54,447 --> 0:10:56,207
<i>Please be here, Come on Alex,</i>


179
0:10:56,207 --> 0:11:1,167
<i>Please be here,</i>


180
0:11:1,167 --> 0:11:3,447
You gotta be kidding me.


181
0:11:3,447 --> 0:11:6,567
There's a waste of a gift certificate.


182
0:11:6,567 --> 0:11:8,927
Cancel the cobbler!


183
0:11:8,927 --> 0:11:12,327
She's not having an orgasm.


184
0:11:12,327 --> 0:11:19,407
Still not seeing what the problem is.


185
0:11:19,407 --> 0:11:25,367
l've never even had an orgasm.


186
0:11:25,367 --> 0:11:28,127
l'm sorry.
l should be more surprised.


187
0:11:28,127 --> 0:11:32,207
That'd be nice.


188
0:11:32,207 --> 0:11:36,127
- l want to talk to you about rounds.
- Here we go. Bring it on.


189
0:11:36,127 --> 0:11:39,567
They're all yours.


190
0:11:39,567 --> 0:11:41,927
You will be leading them from now on.


191
0:11:41,927 --> 0:11:45,407
You've stunned me, but you
haven't dropped me to the mat.


192
0:11:45,407 --> 0:11:49,87
Waiting for the roundhouse here.
The old haymaker,


193
0:11:49,87 --> 0:11:52,87
when the yelling starts
and the voice gets high-pitched.


194
0:11:52,87 --> 0:11:55,7
''Daddy, l've been bad.
Daddy, l've been a bad boy.''


195
0:11:55,7 --> 0:11:59,567
''Oh, Daddy!
Daddy, l've been bad.''


196
0:11:59,567 --> 0:12:3,647
lf you're not gonna play, it's no fun.


197
0:12:3,647 --> 0:12:7,847
Hey, Alex, l am so sorry. l went
to the restaurant but just missed you.


198
0:12:7,847 --> 0:12:10,87
Then l called, but there was no answer,


199
0:12:10,87 --> 0:12:14,87
then l stopped by, and l guess
you didn't see me which was odd,


200
0:12:14,87 --> 0:12:19,727
cos l was standing next to
the pizza guy while you were paying him.


201
0:12:19,727 --> 0:12:23,87
We're still cool, right?


202
0:12:23,87 --> 0:12:28,767
- Look, JD...
- ''Look, JD, we're still great?''


203
0:12:28,767 --> 0:12:32,327
l think you're a really good guy.
OK? But...


204
0:12:32,327 --> 0:12:35,567
- Alex dumped me.
- The blind girl you've been dating?


205
0:12:35,567 --> 0:12:37,647
- She's not blind.
- Of course not.


206
0:12:37,647 --> 0:12:40,527
How'd you drop the ball?
Don't tell me you cried,


207
0:12:40,527 --> 0:12:42,847
or l'll ban you
from the men's room again.


208
0:12:42,847 --> 0:12:48,127
l was so excited what we were
doing here, l forgot about our date.


209
0:12:48,127 --> 0:12:53,127
<i>You didn't forget, You kept looking</i>
<i>at your watch, I saw you,</i>


210
0:12:53,127 --> 0:12:56,727
l assumed that you were
afraid of missing <i>Judging Amy,</i>


211
0:12:56,727 --> 0:12:59,327
lt never occurred to me
you were choosing work


212
0:12:59,327 --> 0:13:2,927
over being with
that sweet little biscuit.


213
0:13:2,927 --> 0:13:4,927
That means a lot coming from you,


214
0:13:4,927 --> 0:13:8,7
Mr Right-here-with-me
two-hours-after-his-shift-


215
0:13:8,7 --> 0:13:11,327
and-last-Monday-night-too... guy.


216
0:13:11,327 --> 0:13:13,807
- What?
- You heard me.


217
0:13:13,807 --> 0:13:16,527
Newbie, what're you saying?


218
0:13:16,527 --> 0:13:21,167
That you want to be like me?


219
0:13:21,167 --> 0:13:33,927
Do you understand that
l just barely want to be like me?


220
0:13:33,927 --> 0:13:37,247
l can't even pretend
l can give you tips on intercourse.


221
0:13:37,247 --> 0:13:39,847
l got one for you.
Stop calling it that.


222
0:13:39,847 --> 0:13:43,807
My therapist thinks my trouble in bed
stems from a fear of intimacy,


223
0:13:43,807 --> 0:13:48,47
but l think it's because any type
of repetitive motion makes me nauseous.


224
0:13:48,47 --> 0:13:52,327
And since l was a kid,
l've had nightmares about being crushed.


225
0:13:52,327 --> 0:13:54,567
That poor shrink.


226
0:13:54,567 --> 0:13:58,887
The one thing l do know is that
l've sabotaged a lot of relationships


227
0:13:58,887 --> 0:14:3,527
by never talking things out
with the guy that l'm seeing.


228
0:14:3,527 --> 0:14:8,567
- Thanks.
- Sure.


229
0:14:8,567 --> 0:14:12,407
So...
You've really never had...


230
0:14:12,407 --> 0:14:14,367
No.


231
0:14:14,367 --> 0:14:19,647
- Not even by yourself?
- Gross.


232
0:14:19,647 --> 0:14:23,167
ls it easy?


233
0:14:23,167 --> 0:14:25,327
When's your next laundry night?


234
0:14:25,327 --> 0:14:27,167
Ted.


235
0:14:27,167 --> 0:14:30,87
l need you to take care
of some lawyer crap for me.


236
0:14:30,87 --> 0:14:36,327
lt'd be great if you would go to traffic
court for me and make this go away.


237
0:14:36,327 --> 0:14:39,967
l don't think so.


238
0:14:39,967 --> 0:14:41,967
Excuse me?


239
0:14:41,967 --> 0:14:47,207
No, Bob! l have my own things
l need to take care of.


240
0:14:47,207 --> 0:14:52,47
Of course.


241
0:14:52,47 --> 0:14:54,287
Walk off, bitch.


242
0:14:54,287 --> 0:14:57,247
How is it, exactly,
that you just said that


243
0:14:57,247 --> 0:14:59,647
and your pants are still dry?


244
0:14:59,647 --> 0:15:2,127
Don't you understand


245
0:15:2,127 --> 0:15:5,247
what you did
when you spoke to those interns?


246
0:15:5,247 --> 0:15:8,687
You took away the fear.


247
0:15:8,687 --> 0:15:13,967
You...
are a wonderful person,


248
0:15:13,967 --> 0:15:23,7
and... l love you.


249
0:15:23,7 --> 0:15:26,887
<i>I have to ask Alex</i>
<i>for another chance, I have to,</i>


250
0:15:26,887 --> 0:15:31,87
<i>OK she's with a hot guy, Stay calm,</i>
<i>She's gonna be psyched to see you,</i>


251
0:15:31,87 --> 0:15:33,407
JD. Hey.


252
0:15:33,407 --> 0:15:34,847
<i>Or not,</i>


253
0:15:34,847 --> 0:15:38,807
l don't prioritise you over my job,
but l'd like to.


254
0:15:38,807 --> 0:15:41,87
l wanted to be a doctor for so long,


255
0:15:41,87 --> 0:15:43,807
l sort of forgot
how to want anything else.


256
0:15:43,807 --> 0:15:47,7
And now l meet you, and...


257
0:15:47,7 --> 0:15:52,47
l'll do anything in the world
if you give me a second chance.


258
0:15:52,47 --> 0:15:56,407
l'm sorry.


259
0:15:56,407 --> 0:16:2,367
l'll leave you guys alone.


260
0:16:2,367 --> 0:16:4,447
OK, Rowdy,


261
0:16:4,447 --> 0:16:6,607
fetch!


262
0:16:6,607 --> 0:16:8,607
Hey, sweetie?


263
0:16:8,607 --> 0:16:11,47
- We have to talk.
- No time for talk.


264
0:16:11,47 --> 0:16:13,567
We have a problem
we need to take care of.


265
0:16:13,567 --> 0:16:16,127
Why are you wearing
a nose-breathing thingy?


266
0:16:16,127 --> 0:16:20,567
Baby, bear with me.
l got big ideas.


267
0:16:20,567 --> 0:16:24,207
l've been having all these
thoughts going through my head,


268
0:16:24,207 --> 0:16:26,727
and l'm afraid if l tell you,
l'd scare you away.


269
0:16:26,727 --> 0:16:32,807
That's the last thing that l wanna...
Take that damn thing off.


270
0:16:32,807 --> 0:16:35,847
Oh, God.


271
0:16:35,847 --> 0:16:43,87
Baby, there's nothing
that could scare me away.


272
0:16:43,87 --> 0:16:46,767
Since we said ''l love you'',
l've been feeling all this pressure.


273
0:16:46,767 --> 0:16:49,407
And wondering about the future.
Our future.


274
0:16:49,407 --> 0:16:52,167
Are we gonna get married?
Are we gonna have kids?


275
0:16:52,167 --> 0:16:54,527
lf so, when will l get my figure back?


276
0:16:54,527 --> 0:16:58,687
Where are we gonna live? Will my mother
live with us? How big a house?


277
0:16:58,687 --> 0:17:1,87
How many bathrooms?
What if she walks in on you


278
0:17:1,87 --> 0:17:5,887
while you're in the bathroom, you fall,
and l can't afford the funeral costs?


279
0:17:5,887 --> 0:17:9,7
That's a little scary.


280
0:17:9,7 --> 0:17:12,487
l guess l just need to know
you think about that stuff too.


281
0:17:12,487 --> 0:17:17,767
Carla?


282
0:17:17,767 --> 0:17:21,607
No, l don't.


283
0:17:21,607 --> 0:17:24,687
- But l love it that you do.
- Yeah?


284
0:17:24,687 --> 0:17:27,407
That's what
makes this relationship work.


285
0:17:27,407 --> 0:17:30,287
We're so different.
l keep us in the present,


286
0:17:30,287 --> 0:17:35,767
you look out for what's up ahead.


287
0:17:35,767 --> 0:17:38,527
Besides, there is no way in hell


288
0:17:38,527 --> 0:17:41,127
your mother's ever
going to live with us.


289
0:17:41,127 --> 0:17:44,87
lf she ever walks in on me
while l'm in the bathroom,


290
0:17:44,87 --> 0:17:46,447
she's getting a trip to Florida.


291
0:17:46,447 --> 0:17:50,527
- No, she's not.
- l'm tell...


292
0:17:50,527 --> 0:17:54,47
Ladies and germs,
if you get this shorthand down,


293
0:17:54,47 --> 0:17:56,647
it has a way of making your day
go quicker.


294
0:17:56,647 --> 0:18:0,7
''CTD'' being ''circling the drain.''
Your patient is on the way out.


295
0:18:0,7 --> 0:18:4,7
''SOB'', ''shortness of breath''
and ''WNL'', ''within normal limits''.


296
0:18:4,7 --> 0:18:6,87
Elvis, feel free to write this down,


297
0:18:6,87 --> 0:18:9,407
any time before
you leave the building.


298
0:18:9,407 --> 0:18:12,167
- You paged me?
- l didn't page you.


299
0:18:12,167 --> 0:18:16,647
<i>And that's when Dr Cox started</i>
<i>poking the old bear with a stick,</i>


300
0:18:16,647 --> 0:18:18,767
l'm sick
of the grill 'em and drill 'em.


301
0:18:18,767 --> 0:18:21,287
What do you say
we shake things up?


302
0:18:21,287 --> 0:18:26,327
You kids ask me the questions,
and l'll just give you the answers.


303
0:18:26,327 --> 0:18:29,407
Dr Cox, could l talk to you?


304
0:18:29,407 --> 0:18:33,807
Sure, Bob, but you have to raise
your hand like all the other children.


305
0:18:33,807 --> 0:18:37,127
- l just think it's inappropriate...
- Bob-o?


306
0:18:37,127 --> 0:18:39,687
Now, you've got five
good ones right there.


307
0:18:39,687 --> 0:18:44,487
What do you say you put 'em up
in the air like you just don't care?


308
0:18:44,487 --> 0:18:46,687
Get over here, right now.


309
0:18:46,687 --> 0:18:50,807
<i>Maybe he felt sorry for Kelso and</i>
<i>didn't wanna take the one thing he had,</i>


310
0:18:50,807 --> 0:18:54,7
<i>Maybe he just hated rounds,</i>


311
0:18:54,7 --> 0:18:56,87
Get the hell outta my lCU!


312
0:18:56,87 --> 0:18:58,607
<i>But if you didn't</i>
<i>know Dr Cox like I did</i>


313
0:18:58,607 --> 0:19:2,7
<i>you would've believed</i>
<i>his performance too,</i>


314
0:19:2,7 --> 0:19:5,527
<i>I guess the key</i>
<i>to a lot of things is balance,</i>


315
0:19:5,527 --> 0:19:9,487
<i>Whether it's balance of power,,,</i>


316
0:19:9,487 --> 0:19:12,967
Dr Simotas, stop smiling.


317
0:19:12,967 --> 0:19:17,247
l hate smiling.


318
0:19:17,247 --> 0:19:21,487
<i>,,,balance in love,,,</i>


319
0:19:21,487 --> 0:19:24,367
<i>,,,or sometimes,,,</i>


320
0:19:24,367 --> 0:19:30,127
<i>,,,just balance,</i>


321
0:19:30,127 --> 0:19:46,487
<i>For some of us</i>
<i>it seems too far out of reach,</i>


322
0:19:46,487 --> 0:20:24,767
<i>Too difficult to achieve,</i>


323
0:20:24,767 --> 0:20:30,167
<i>But the important thing</i>
<i>is just to never stop trying,</i>


324
0:20:30,167 --> 0:20:33,167
<i>Especially if you</i>
<i>like girls named Alex,</i>


325
0:20:33,167 --> 0:22:33,167
<i>And chicken salad,</i>
