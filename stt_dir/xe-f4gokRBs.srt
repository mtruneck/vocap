Hey it's me Destin. Welcome back to Smarter Every Day. Today we're gonna do awesome science with


2
0:0:4,0 --> 0:0:8,0
Orbix Hot Glass here at Lookout Mountain Alabama. Goggle up.


3
0:0:8,0 --> 0:0:12,0
Science is about to happen. We're gonna use a high speed camera and learn about Prince Rupert's Drop.


4
0:0:12,0 --> 0:0:16,0
[whispers] It's never been done on the internet. You're gonna learn something.


5
0:0:16,0 --> 0:0:18,0
Let's go.


6
0:0:18,0 --> 0:0:22,5



7
0:0:22,5 --> 0:0:24,0
OK we are here inside the shop with


8
0:0:24,0 --> 0:0:28,0
Cal. Cal owns the place. Can you show me how to make a Prince Rupert's Drop?


9
0:0:28,0 --> 0:0:32,0
(Cal) Sure. I'm gonna gather some glass, drop it in a bucket of


10
0:0:32,0 --> 0:0:34,0
cold water.


11
0:0:34,0 --> 0:0:36,0



12
0:0:36,0 --> 0:0:41,5
[sizzling sound]


13
0:0:41,5 --> 0:0:44,0
(Destin) So after it cools down, this is what you're left with.


14
0:0:44,0 --> 0:0:48,0
It kinda looks like a tadpole, but it has some really interesting mechanical properties.


15
0:0:48,0 --> 0:0:52,0
We can actually hit this thing with a hammer and it won't break.


16
0:0:52,0 --> 0:0:56,0
OK I'm ready. [bang]
Didn't go.


17
0:0:56,0 --> 0:1:0,0
OK I think Cal is kind of a pansy so I.. You think you can break it? [laugh]


18
0:1:0,0 --> 0:1:4,0
So we're gonna try again only this time I'm gonna make him hit it really hard


19
0:1:4,0 --> 0:1:8,0
and I'm gonna record it with high speed. Does that work? Think you can break it? Alright. Let's do it.


20
0:1:8,0 --> 0:1:12,0
The challenge is on.
(Cal) Just hit it?
- Yep.


21
0:1:12,0 --> 0:1:16,0
[bang] [shattering] [laughs]
So do you think you actually broke it? I don't think


22
0:1:16,0 --> 0:1:20,0
you did. You think you broke it?
- I know I broke it. [laugh]


23
0:1:20,0 --> 0:1:24,0
- Let's look at the high speed.


24
0:1:24,0 --> 0:1:26,0
[music]


25
0:1:26,0 --> 0:1:28,0



26
0:1:28,0 --> 0:1:32,0
OK so the drop broke, but technically it wasn't the


27
0:1:32,0 --> 0:1:36,0
hammer that broke it. If you look close in the high speed you can see that it's the wiggling of the


28
0:1:36,0 --> 0:1:40,0
tail that makes it go. This is the mystery of the


29
0:1:40,0 --> 0:1:44,0
Prince Rupert's Drop. You can try


30
0:1:44,0 --> 0:1:48,0
as hard as you can to break the bulb, but you can't.


31
0:1:48,0 --> 0:1:52,0
But, if you even nick the tail, the entire thing will explode. Not shatter,


32
0:1:52,0 --> 0:1:56,0
but actually explode. Let's go outside and I'll show you more.


33
0:1:56,0 --> 0:2:0,0
OK we're gonna just run an obscene frame rate here. We have this


34
0:2:0,0 --> 0:2:4,0
Phantom V1610. So, glass breaking occurs


35
0:2:4,0 --> 0:2:8,0
so fast that you have to have like hundreds of thousands of frames per second, so we're gonna


36
0:2:8,0 --> 0:2:12,0
have a lower resolution and we have to have a lot of light as well. We're also gonna use this Miro over


37
0:2:12,0 --> 0:2:16,0
here to run about 3000 frames per second so we can get a wide shot to see the whole event.


38
0:2:16,0 --> 0:2:20,0
as well.
3..2..1.. go.


39
0:2:20,0 --> 0:2:24,0

      [Awesome Music by Gordon McGladdery}


41
0:2:26,0 --> 0:2:56,0



42
0:2:56,0 --> 0:3:0,0
OK now we understand what a Prince Rupert Drop does, but at this point


43
0:3:0,0 --> 0:3:4,0
we don't quite understand why it does it. Let's take a closer look.


44
0:3:4,0 --> 0:3:8,0
OK this is called a polariscope and basically what it is is it's a filtered piece of


45
0:3:8,0 --> 0:3:12,0
glass that's polarized. I have another filter here. You can see if I turn it,


46
0:3:12,0 --> 0:3:16,0
then I can block out the light. Now if I put this on the camera


47
0:3:16,0 --> 0:3:20,0
that you're looking through here, and then I put the Prince Rupert's Drop in between


48
0:3:20,0 --> 0:3:24,0
the two pieces of glass, you should be able to see the internal stresses built up


49
0:3:24,0 --> 0:3:28,0
inside the Prince Rupert's Drop. So to understand how these stresses got here, let's


50
0:3:28,0 --> 0:3:32,0
use the color grey to represent nice and strong solid glass. We use red


51
0:3:32,0 --> 0:3:36,0
to represent molten glass and because of the thermal expansion coefficient it's safe to assume that the


52
0:3:36,0 --> 0:3:40,0
higher the temperature the larger this glass wants to be. Blue represents glass that's cooling


53
0:3:40,0 --> 0:3:44,0
off, or transitioning between the two states. Because of that same thermal expansion coefficient 


54
0:3:44,0 --> 0:3:48,0
this glass is shrinking and basically pulling in on itself. Think of a


55
0:3:48,0 --> 0:3:52,0
Prince Rupert's Drop as a bunch of little infantessimal pieces of glass with each piece trying to interact


56
0:3:52,0 --> 0:3:56,0
with the pieces around it. When the molten glass is first dripped into the water, the


57
0:3:56,0 --> 0:4:0,0
outside layer touches the water and immediately solidifies. This locks in that


58
0:4:0,0 --> 0:4:4,0
outside shape of the drop. The inside of the drop however is still a hot expanded


59
0:4:4,0 --> 0:4:8,0
liquid. As heat's transferred to the water that glass on the inside slowly begins to


60
0:4:8,0 --> 0:4:12,0
cool down, and pulls in against that outside layer. The problem is that


61
0:4:12,0 --> 0:4:16,0
because it's already locked in as a round solid, it only compresses tighter against


62
0:4:16,0 --> 0:4:20,0
itself. This actually makes it stronger. Kind of like how an arch compresses and gets stronger when


63
0:4:20,0 --> 0:4:24,0
you put your weight on it only this is in all directions. And because the cooling glass can't


64
0:4:24,0 --> 0:4:28,0
move that outside layer it begins to pull against itself, causing it to be


65
0:4:28,0 --> 0:4:32,0
in extremely high tension. It then hardens in this state of tension and there you have it, a


66
0:4:32,0 --> 0:4:36,0
Prince Rupert's Drop. The outside is in extremely high compressive stress and the inside is in


67
0:4:36,0 --> 0:4:40,0
extremely high tensile stress. If one link in this tension chain is ever cut, it


68
0:4:40,0 --> 0:4:44,0
breaks on down the line, feeding off of its own stored up energy just like a chemical


69
0:4:44,0 --> 0:4:48,0
explosive does. The difference here is that instead of releasing chemical potential energy


70
0:4:48,0 --> 0:4:52,0
mechanical strain energy is released. This wave of energy is what we call a


71
0:4:52,0 --> 0:4:56,0
failure front. You can directly measure the velocity of that failure front as long as


72
0:4:56,0 --> 0:5:0,0
you have a camera fast enough. Let's give it a shot at 130,000 frames


73
0:5:0,0 --> 0:5:4,0
per second.
3..2..1..go.


74
0:5:4,0 --> 0:5:8,0
Got it?

86
0:5:52,0 --> 0:5:56,0
With the helmet. [laugh] It's a sad looking cat.


87
0:5:56,0 --> 0:6:0,0
You've never caught the cat on fire, ever?
- Never.
- Not even once?


88
0:6:0,0 --> 0:6:4,0
- Never.
- These things are named for a guy named Prince Rupert, imagine that,


89
0:6:4,0 --> 0:6:8,0
who lived in Bavaria back in the 1600s.
Here, here.


90
0:6:8,0 --> 0:6:12,0
[shins banging on concrete laughter through pain]


91
0:6:12,0 --> 0:6:16,0
He brought these over as a gift to King Charles II in England who gave them to his


92
0:6:16,0 --> 0:6:20,0
Royal Society to try to figure out.
Yep ready. [clang]


93
0:6:20,0 --> 0:6:22,0
Holy smokes!


94
0:6:22,0 --> 0:6:24,0



95
0:6:24,0 --> 0:6:28,0
- Aah the tension's killing me. [shatter]
-(Destin in background) NO DON'T BLOW UP!


96
0:6:28,0 --> 0:6:32,0
- You know it blow.. blowed up?
- Yep, it blowed up.


97
0:6:32,0 --> 0:6:33,0
- It BLOWED UP Y'ALL! [laugh]


98
0:6:33,0 --> 0:6:35,0



99
0:6:35,0 --> 0:6:36,0
Captioning in different languages welcome.
Please contact Destin if you can help.
