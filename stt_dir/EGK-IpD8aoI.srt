1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:0,29



2
0:0:0,29 --> 0:0:1,556
FREDDY CORBIN: Where
your thumb is.


3
0:0:1,556 --> 0:0:2,2
Push an arrow.


4
0:0:2,2 --> 0:0:2,448
I'm on!


5
0:0:2,448 --> 0:0:3,117
MALE SPEAKER: Little
green light.


6
0:0:3,117 --> 0:0:3,34
Yeah.


7
0:0:3,34 --> 0:0:3,61
FREDDY CORBIN: I'm on.


8
0:0:3,61 --> 0:0:4,19
MALE SPEAKER: There we go.


9
0:0:4,19 --> 0:0:4,65
FREDDY CORBIN: OK.


10
0:0:4,65 --> 0:0:5,437
MALE SPEAKER: Ready to come.


11
0:0:5,437 --> 0:0:6,8
FREDDY CORBIN: And then
you got the zoom.


12
0:0:6,8 --> 0:0:8,102
See?


13
0:0:8,102 --> 0:0:9,49
Forward, backward,
the zoom thing?


14
0:0:9,49 --> 0:0:9,98
MALE SPEAKER: Yep.


15
0:0:9,98 --> 0:0:10,505
FREDDY CORBIN: OK.


16
0:0:10,505 --> 0:0:10,85
Folks--


17
0:0:10,85 --> 0:0:11,1
MALE SPEAKER: We're zooming.


18
0:0:11,1 --> 0:0:11,48
We're zooming.


19
0:0:11,48 --> 0:0:11,95
FREDDY CORBIN: I love ya.


20
0:0:11,95 --> 0:0:12,655
It's going to be a good thing.


21
0:0:12,655 --> 0:0:14,28
OK, so you can turn it off.


22
0:0:14,28 --> 0:0:18,28
Da, da--


23
0:0:18,28 --> 0:0:19,28
MALE SPEAKER: Hey, you're
going second, right?


24
0:0:19,28 --> 0:0:22,38
FREDDY CORBIN: Da, da.


25
0:0:22,38 --> 0:0:24,5
MALE SPEAKER: The biggest
nerds in the world.


26
0:0:24,5 --> 0:0:26,97



27
0:0:26,97 --> 0:0:27,46
FREDDY CORBIN: OK.


28
0:0:27,46 --> 0:0:28,64
I leave Malibu to my brother.


29
0:0:28,64 --> 0:0:30,52
All the Jesus shit to Eileen.


30
0:0:30,52 --> 0:0:32,49
And everything else
goes to John.


31
0:0:32,49 --> 0:0:34,14
EDDY DEUTSCHE: Last will and
testament right here.


32
0:0:34,14 --> 0:0:36,187
Al, you get everything, baby.


33
0:0:36,187 --> 0:0:37,61
MALE SPEAKER: Right on.


34
0:0:37,61 --> 0:0:38,2
EDDY DEUTSCHE: Everything.


35
0:0:38,2 --> 0:0:39,58
MALE SPEAKER: Igor?


36
0:0:39,58 --> 0:0:40,62
IGOR MORTIS: I want
Eddy's machines.


37
0:0:40,62 --> 0:0:42,6
EDDY DEUTSCHE: And Igor can
have a couple machines.


38
0:0:42,6 --> 0:0:43,765
But you get to pick them.


39
0:0:43,765 --> 0:0:44,54
And Freddy--


40
0:0:44,54 --> 0:0:46,43
FREDDY CORBIN: But you're
going to be dead.


41
0:0:46,43 --> 0:0:48,2
MALE SPEAKER: You can't leave
shit to each other.


42
0:0:48,2 --> 0:0:49,43
MALE SPEAKER: Guy?


43
0:0:49,43 --> 0:0:50,775
GUY ATCHINSON: Amy gets
everything except the tattoo


44
0:0:50,775 --> 0:0:52,83
shit, which I'm giving
to Mad Jack.


45
0:0:52,83 --> 0:0:53,815
MALE SPEAKER: All right.


46
0:0:53,815 --> 0:0:55,6
And Igor?


47
0:0:55,6 --> 0:0:57,46
IGOR MORTIS: I'm taking
it all with me.


48
0:0:57,46 --> 0:0:58,42
EDDY DEUTSCHE: He doesn't
have anything.


49
0:0:58,42 --> 0:0:59,38
That's why!


50
0:0:59,38 --> 0:1:0,82
IGOR MORTIS: Bad omen.


51
0:1:0,82 --> 0:1:2,15
FREDDY CORBIN: Just
don't get nervous.


52
0:1:2,15 --> 0:1:5,62
I know you're going to
jump 9,000 feet.


53
0:1:5,62 --> 0:1:7,84
Just don't get nervous.


54
0:1:7,84 --> 0:1:12,928



55
0:1:12,928 --> 0:1:15,226
MALE SPEAKER: Ahh,
right on the pad.


56
0:1:15,226 --> 0:1:17,52
MALE SPEAKER: Eddy!


57
0:1:17,52 --> 0:1:18,856
Was it fun?


58
0:1:18,856 --> 0:1:19,805
MALE SPEAKER: He doesn't
remember.


59
0:1:19,805 --> 0:1:21,236
He missed most of the jump.


60
0:1:21,236 --> 0:1:22,486
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.


61
0:1:22,486 --> 0:1:25,61



62
0:1:25,61 --> 0:1:27,25
MALE SPEAKER: Smiling
all the way down.


63
0:1:27,25 --> 0:1:42,8



64
0:1:42,8 --> 0:1:42,38
FREDDY CORBIN: Go nuts.


65
0:1:42,38 --> 0:1:47,21
You can pull all my videos
off the shelf.


66
0:1:47,21 --> 0:1:49,16
Here's some water.


67
0:1:49,16 --> 0:1:51,86
I need some for work.


68
0:1:51,86 --> 0:1:53,345
Here.


69
0:1:53,345 --> 0:1:56,32
Now he's going to want this.


70
0:1:56,32 --> 0:1:57,17
Go ahead.


71
0:1:57,17 --> 0:1:58,43
It's cheap.


72
0:1:58,43 --> 0:2:1,95
Now this is a cool photo.


73
0:2:1,95 --> 0:2:5,39
This is doing the last
tattoo at Realistic.


74
0:2:5,39 --> 0:2:7,535
That's Howie the Cosmic
Commander.


75
0:2:7,535 --> 0:2:12,1
This would probably be about
June or May of '91.


76
0:2:12,1 --> 0:2:15,2
And you'll recognize those
screens in the tattoo time.


77
0:2:15,2 --> 0:2:18,74
Realistic Studio was
opened up in '74.


78
0:2:18,74 --> 0:2:21,85
I had the honor of working
there in '90 and '91.


79
0:2:21,85 --> 0:2:25,28
And what it was was Ed went over
to Japan after hanging


80
0:2:25,28 --> 0:2:29,23
out with Jerry in Hawaii and
stuff, and when he came back


81
0:2:29,23 --> 0:2:32,97
he wanted to open up, basically,
the United States'


82
0:2:32,97 --> 0:2:38,24
first appointment only non
walk-in tattoo shop.


83
0:2:38,24 --> 0:2:39,38
There was no sign.


84
0:2:39,38 --> 0:2:42,6
You couldn't see it
from the street.


85
0:2:42,6 --> 0:2:45,29
That's where Bob
Roberts worked.


86
0:2:45,29 --> 0:2:46,48
Greg Irons worked there.


87
0:2:46,48 --> 0:2:47,59
Phillip sat in there.


88
0:2:47,59 --> 0:2:50,17
Leo Zulueta worked there.


89
0:2:50,17 --> 0:2:54,57
What happened was, Realistic,
the lease was coming up, and


90
0:2:54,57 --> 0:2:57,81
Eddy wanted to move
to San Francisco.


91
0:2:57,81 --> 0:2:59,71
And we wanted to work together,
but we didn't want


92
0:2:59,71 --> 0:3:2,61
to work in that back
room format.


93
0:3:2,61 --> 0:3:5,13
We wanted a walk-in
tattoo shop.


94
0:3:5,13 --> 0:3:8,99
We, basically, were going to
open up a shop and we were


95
0:3:8,99 --> 0:3:12,97
going to hire Igor Mortis and
Dan Higgs, and that's where


96
0:3:12,97 --> 0:3:15,39
the whole Temple Dude
tattoo came from.


97
0:3:15,39 --> 0:3:17,64
Because we were going to work
a convention, I think in New


98
0:3:17,64 --> 0:3:19,54
Orleans together, but we weren't
going to really be


99
0:3:19,54 --> 0:3:21,87
able to talk about
the shop yet.


100
0:3:21,87 --> 0:3:24,84
But we felt, out of respect, we
should go to Ed first and


101
0:3:24,84 --> 0:3:27,31
ask Ed if he wanted
to own the shop.


102
0:3:27,31 --> 0:3:31,93
And we were driving across the
Bay Bridge he actually brought


103
0:3:31,93 --> 0:3:33,3
it up, so what are you
going to do Fred?


104
0:3:33,3 --> 0:3:33,95
Your lease is coming up.


105
0:3:33,95 --> 0:3:35,2
I been wanting to talk
you about that.


106
0:3:35,2 --> 0:3:36,66
I got this idea.


107
0:3:36,66 --> 0:3:41,89
He drove from the bridge to
Columbus and was like, this is


108
0:3:41,89 --> 0:3:44,7
where I wanted to open up
when I first got back.


109
0:3:44,7 --> 0:3:48,43
And the next morning he
had the place rented.


110
0:3:48,43 --> 0:3:49,64
That's how he operates.


111
0:3:49,64 --> 0:3:51,99
He just gets shit done.


112
0:3:51,99 --> 0:3:57,72
So we opened up Tattoo City on
July 1 of '91, and I worked


113
0:3:57,72 --> 0:4:0,2
there till about '96.


114
0:4:0,2 --> 0:4:2,35
If I were to be really truthful,
it was really


115
0:4:2,35 --> 0:4:5,92
difficult working with Eddy
Deutsche and Ed Hardy, because


116
0:4:5,92 --> 0:4:8,34
I had only been tattooing
a few years.


117
0:4:8,34 --> 0:4:11,58
And Eddy was amazing
from the gate.


118
0:4:11,58 --> 0:4:14,68
And Ed Hardy was the best
tattooer in the world.


119
0:4:14,68 --> 0:4:16,24
Like living in a fishbowl.


120
0:4:16,24 --> 0:4:19,339
We opened up Tattoo City and
people are coming in and just


121
0:4:19,339 --> 0:4:20,56
expecting me to be able to--


122
0:4:20,56 --> 0:4:22,87
I want a back piece of this,
and I want this.


123
0:4:22,87 --> 0:4:25,54
And I wasn't ready to do big
tattoos like that yet.


124
0:4:25,54 --> 0:4:26,86
There were some that
I could do.


125
0:4:26,86 --> 0:4:30,51
I could do a big Jesus head back
piece or a big rock of


126
0:4:30,51 --> 0:4:32,52
ages maybe because they
were simple enough.


127
0:4:32,52 --> 0:4:35,84
But I couldn't do wind bars or
Japanese water back then, and


128
0:4:35,84 --> 0:4:36,69
stuff like that.


129
0:4:36,69 --> 0:4:38,71
I still had to learn how
to do all that stuff.


130
0:4:38,71 --> 0:4:42,53
I did feel a lot of pressure, to
be honest, to be able to do


131
0:4:42,53 --> 0:4:47,3
anything because I worked for
Ed Hardy at Tattoo City.


132
0:4:47,3 --> 0:4:50,14
I think a big dynamic of one of
the reasons that I got into


133
0:4:50,14 --> 0:4:55,12
drugs even was because there
was so much pressure.


134
0:4:55,12 --> 0:4:56,84
I never got into heroin
and stuff because I


135
0:4:56,84 --> 0:4:58,4
had a career going.


136
0:4:58,4 --> 0:5:0,52
Like, I work for Ed Hardy.


137
0:5:0,52 --> 0:5:2,11
I didn't take this
shit lightly.


138
0:5:2,11 --> 0:5:6,1
I'd start popping Valiums
at the end of the day.


139
0:5:6,1 --> 0:5:10,4
And I'll say, it kind of helped
for a while, because


140
0:5:10,4 --> 0:5:13,73
you're working all day and
you're tattooing somebody,


141
0:5:13,73 --> 0:5:14,91
that's a pretty serious thing.


142
0:5:14,91 --> 0:5:15,56
You know what I mean?


143
0:5:15,56 --> 0:5:16,66
It's not like a haircut.


144
0:5:16,66 --> 0:5:17,93
It doesn't grow back.


145
0:5:17,93 --> 0:5:19,62
And I remember the first
time I used to--


146
0:5:19,62 --> 0:5:20,65
this was before cable--


147
0:5:20,65 --> 0:5:22,94
I used to love David
Letterman.


148
0:5:22,94 --> 0:5:26,33
And I'd watch David Letterman
and I remember smoking a joint


149
0:5:26,33 --> 0:5:30,22
and taking a couple Valiums and
feeling that feeling, that


150
0:5:30,22 --> 0:5:32,19
kind of calmness and serenity.


151
0:5:32,19 --> 0:5:33,91
Like, oh, wow.


152
0:5:33,91 --> 0:5:35,95
This feels really good.


153
0:5:35,95 --> 0:5:37,94
And I got into--


154
0:5:37,94 --> 0:5:40,99
when I started getting my ribs
tattooed I started taking some


155
0:5:40,99 --> 0:5:42,9
dilaudids and some
morphine pills.


156
0:5:42,9 --> 0:5:46,38
And my brother, unfortunately at
the time, was getting into


157
0:5:46,38 --> 0:5:47,81
heroin and using heroin.


158
0:5:47,81 --> 0:5:50,65
And there was nobody shooting
up, there was no junkies


159
0:5:50,65 --> 0:5:53,17
hanging around, it was like,
let's just buy a little bit


160
0:5:53,17 --> 0:5:54,35
and smoke it on some foil.


161
0:5:54,35 --> 0:5:59,19
And it seemed at the time, not
innocent, but not harmful.


162
0:5:59,19 --> 0:6:2,31
It didn't seem as harmful
as it really was.


163
0:6:2,31 --> 0:6:5,51
And ironically Ed had given me
a month off because I was


164
0:6:5,51 --> 0:6:7,16
doing so good.


165
0:6:7,16 --> 0:6:11,18
I mean, we had closed Realistic
and opened up Tattoo


166
0:6:11,18 --> 0:6:14,64
City and I was working
my ass off.


167
0:6:14,64 --> 0:6:17,23
He said, Freddy, you've
been doing so good.


168
0:6:17,23 --> 0:6:19,48
You should take a
month off, dude.


169
0:6:19,48 --> 0:6:22,43
And that was the month
I got strung out.


170
0:6:22,43 --> 0:6:26,69
Because I just laid around my
house and covered the windows


171
0:6:26,69 --> 0:6:31,1
and slept for-- would just go
into my room and not come out.


172
0:6:31,1 --> 0:6:35,6
And I would try the 90 meetings
in 90 days thing.


173
0:6:35,6 --> 0:6:36,1
It's just not me.


174
0:6:36,1 --> 0:6:38,86
And then I would go through
periods of just


175
0:6:38,86 --> 0:6:41,8
giving up even trying.


176
0:6:41,8 --> 0:6:43,93
I had gone to Amsterdam and I
was living in the Red Light


177
0:6:43,93 --> 0:6:45,946
District and I was
using a lot.


178
0:6:45,946 --> 0:6:47,89
And some crazy shit went down.


179
0:6:47,89 --> 0:6:49,59
My brother got in
a car accident.


180
0:6:49,59 --> 0:6:52,16
My brother was a paraplegic.


181
0:6:52,16 --> 0:6:55,15
I called Ed and let him know
what was going on and that's


182
0:6:55,15 --> 0:6:57,73
kind of when I got canned at
Tattoo City and stuff.


183
0:6:57,73 --> 0:6:59,94
I wanted to tell Ed that I was
strung out because I really,


184
0:6:59,94 --> 0:7:0,99
really respected him.


185
0:7:0,99 --> 0:7:2,35
But Ed's business.


186
0:7:2,35 --> 0:7:4,735
So I always knew that Ed would
be like, well, Freddy, I love


187
0:7:4,735 --> 0:7:7,65
ya and I appreciate you telling
me but you gotta go.


188
0:7:7,65 --> 0:7:9,14
And I was fine with that.


189
0:7:9,14 --> 0:7:11,15
But I wanted to kind
of go to him--


190
0:7:11,15 --> 0:7:12,59
it sounds silly in
retrospect--


191
0:7:12,59 --> 0:7:15,43
but I wanted to kind of get
clean and then go to Ed and


192
0:7:15,43 --> 0:7:16,61
say here's what's
been going on.


193
0:7:16,61 --> 0:7:20,32
But in the midst of my grandiose
plan of trying to do


194
0:7:20,32 --> 0:7:23,23
this and figure out all this
crazy shit, because it's like


195
0:7:23,23 --> 0:7:27,21
you're getting caught
up in a shit storm.


196
0:7:27,21 --> 0:7:28,74
He basically canned me.


197
0:7:28,74 --> 0:7:32,29
And then, from what my mom tells
me and Eddy and stuff,


198
0:7:32,29 --> 0:7:34,32
that he was really concerned
at first.


199
0:7:34,32 --> 0:7:35,45
It was like, what are
we going to do?


200
0:7:35,45 --> 0:7:36,48
We gotta get him into rehab.


201
0:7:36,48 --> 0:7:39,74
But by the time I was walking
through the gate, he was


202
0:7:39,74 --> 0:7:42,3
yelling at me and screaming at
me and all kinds of shit.


203
0:7:42,3 --> 0:7:46,12
So I think he just got
kind of angry.


204
0:7:46,12 --> 0:7:48,8
Then it was like
all eyes on me.


205
0:7:48,8 --> 0:7:49,71
Around the world.


206
0:7:49,71 --> 0:7:53,1
What's Freddy going to
do kind of shit.


207
0:7:53,1 --> 0:7:55,48
It's just really good gossip.


208
0:7:55,48 --> 0:7:57,18
That's pretty much it.


209
0:7:57,18 --> 0:8:2,16
It's like, I think there's
a couple dynamics.


210
0:8:2,16 --> 0:8:4,32
There's it's great gossip.


211
0:8:4,32 --> 0:8:5,87
There's the hater aspect.


212
0:8:5,87 --> 0:8:9,21
And then there's the concerned
friend aspect of it, too.


213
0:8:9,21 --> 0:8:10,61
There were people that really
loved me that were


214
0:8:10,61 --> 0:8:12,11
concerned about me.


215
0:8:12,11 --> 0:8:15,0
There were a lot of people
that were stoked.


216
0:8:15,0 --> 0:8:17,57
I don't mean stoked to
see me go down, but


217
0:8:17,57 --> 0:8:20,53
like, I had '66 Chevelle.


218
0:8:20,53 --> 0:8:22,31
I was young, I was making
money, I was


219
0:8:22,31 --> 0:8:23,4
working for Ed Hardy.


220
0:8:23,4 --> 0:8:25,92
I was kind of rolling.


221
0:8:25,92 --> 0:8:28,55
JASON MCAFEE: I don't really
know if I think that's the way


222
0:8:28,55 --> 0:8:30,82
people wanted to see
it go for Freddy.


223
0:8:30,82 --> 0:8:33,34
Even though he might say that,
I don't really think so.


224
0:8:33,34 --> 0:8:36,69
I think people love him and
never really want to be like,


225
0:8:36,69 --> 0:8:37,98
yeah, fucking Freddy's
fucked up.


226
0:8:37,98 --> 0:8:39,58
Or Freddy fuckin' blah, blah.


227
0:8:39,58 --> 0:8:41,919
I think that could be
his own little thing


228
0:8:41,919 --> 0:8:44,71
going on with him.


229
0:8:44,71 --> 0:8:47,84
I didn't know about the Tattoo
City thing, and why he got


230
0:8:47,84 --> 0:8:53,0
fired, or the stuff with him and
Ed, or drugs or whatever


231
0:8:53,0 --> 0:8:55,61
had been going on with him.


232
0:8:55,61 --> 0:8:56,94
He was very open about it.


233
0:8:56,94 --> 0:9:0,51
He's a very open person, and was
very like, hey, man, just


234
0:9:0,51 --> 0:9:2,65
want you to know, this is
what's happened and


235
0:9:2,65 --> 0:9:3,71
you might get shit.


236
0:9:3,71 --> 0:9:6,73
And people are always going to
be like, oh, Freddy Corbin


237
0:9:6,73 --> 0:9:8,33
because he's messed
up or whatever.


238
0:9:8,33 --> 0:9:11,24
But he's been through
some bad shit.


239
0:9:11,24 --> 0:9:14,24
People dying, his brother
getting in an accident and


240
0:9:14,24 --> 0:9:17,44
being paralyzed, his brother
dying recently.


241
0:9:17,44 --> 0:9:19,2
Things just with
his whole life.


242
0:9:19,2 --> 0:9:21,99
Like, he's had a pretty
rough run.


243
0:9:21,99 --> 0:9:25,7
And he's come out on top
and been amazing.


244
0:9:25,7 --> 0:9:27,45
There's something about him,
that his soul and his heart is


245
0:9:27,45 --> 0:9:29,16
just so genuine and so real.


246
0:9:29,16 --> 0:9:33,38
And no matter if he was drugs or
not or weed or whatever the


247
0:9:33,38 --> 0:9:36,49
fuck he was doing, there's this
part of him that you just


248
0:9:36,49 --> 0:9:38,76
care about and I love
no matter what.


249
0:9:38,76 --> 0:9:40,78
FREDDY CORBIN: Of course I
wanted to do the right thing,


250
0:9:40,78 --> 0:9:41,97
whatever that was.


251
0:9:41,97 --> 0:9:44,64
So I got off dope.


252
0:9:44,64 --> 0:9:47,38
I stayed clean for a little
while, but not long.


253
0:9:47,38 --> 0:9:51,64
And then I ended up going back
to Amsterdam and kind of just


254
0:9:51,64 --> 0:9:53,29
bailing the whole scene.


255
0:9:53,29 --> 0:9:56,22
I continued to use in Amsterdam
for a while, and


256
0:9:56,22 --> 0:9:58,94
even here in Oakland for a
little bit, and then just


257
0:9:58,94 --> 0:9:59,54
wasn't happy.


258
0:9:59,54 --> 0:10:1,16
It just wasn't working for me.


259
0:10:1,16 --> 0:10:4,92
Just staying well and
just darkness,


260
0:10:4,92 --> 0:10:6,92
just living in darkness.


261
0:10:6,92 --> 0:10:11,67
So my friend Vinny was always
really cool about being really


262
0:10:11,67 --> 0:10:16,72
supportive in a non-judgmental
kind of way, was always there


263
0:10:16,72 --> 0:10:18,33
for me as a friend.


264
0:10:18,33 --> 0:10:22,5
And even my wife Lisa, who was
then my girlfriend, as


265
0:10:22,5 --> 0:10:27,75
stubborn as we both can be,
and as much as we're on


266
0:10:27,75 --> 0:10:31,11
opposite ends of the spectrum
when it comes to things like


267
0:10:31,11 --> 0:10:35,47
religion or going to India or
shit like that, she was always


268
0:10:35,47 --> 0:10:36,53
there for me, too.


269
0:10:36,53 --> 0:10:39,2
So the two of them are really
instrumental in me kind of


270
0:10:39,2 --> 0:10:41,14
getting my shit together.


271
0:10:41,14 --> 0:10:42,23
LISA CORBIN: A lot
of us have gone


272
0:10:42,23 --> 0:10:43,93
through the similar things.


273
0:10:43,93 --> 0:10:46,67
It is helpful to have other
people because they can kind


274
0:10:46,67 --> 0:10:48,55
of call you on your shit.


275
0:10:48,55 --> 0:10:50,77
But there are times when
we were all just


276
0:10:50,77 --> 0:10:52,75
like, what can we do?


277
0:10:52,75 --> 0:10:54,17
At a loss.


278
0:10:54,17 --> 0:11:1,58
And there are times with Freddy
that were very scary.


279
0:11:1,58 --> 0:11:4,86
Knowing Freddy has been a
journey, and sometimes I've


280
0:11:4,86 --> 0:11:9,28
had to hold on with the tightest
ropes I've ever had


281
0:11:9,28 --> 0:11:12,51
to hold on to in
my entire life.


282
0:11:12,51 --> 0:11:16,3
And I go through all that doubt
of, what am I doing?


283
0:11:16,3 --> 0:11:18,19
Am I crazy?


284
0:11:18,19 --> 0:11:19,91
But there was always
something there.


285
0:11:19,91 --> 0:11:21,18
There's always that bond.


286
0:11:21,18 --> 0:11:23,28
There was always that
connection.


287
0:11:23,28 --> 0:11:29,15
And it's just been amazing to
see him pull through that.


288
0:11:29,15 --> 0:11:30,852
There must have been something
deep down that


289
0:11:30,852 --> 0:11:31,82
made him want to live.


290
0:11:31,82 --> 0:11:34,87
And then we have Sonny,
our awesome son.


291
0:11:34,87 --> 0:11:39,5
And he's just sort of taken, I
think, some of that energy and


292
0:11:39,5 --> 0:11:44,59
put it into him and they have
a beautiful relationship.


293
0:11:44,59 --> 0:11:46,365
Makes me jealous sometimes.


294
0:11:46,365 --> 0:11:49,195
FREDDY CORBIN: [HUMMING]


295
0:11:49,195 --> 0:11:50,65
Ready for the dip?


296
0:11:50,65 --> 0:11:54,45
Can you dip?


297
0:11:54,45 --> 0:11:56,96
Oh, that's the sound.


298
0:11:56,96 --> 0:11:59,54
I guess you do the right thing,
good things happened.


299
0:11:59,54 --> 0:12:4,776
Because I was always petrified
of having a kid, because I had


300
0:12:4,776 --> 0:12:5,85
been strung out for
so many years.


301
0:12:5,85 --> 0:12:7,925
So it was just like, I wouldn't
be a good father.


302
0:12:7,925 --> 0:12:11,14
I could never do this or
how would this work?


303
0:12:11,14 --> 0:12:14,0
The two things that petrified me
the most were getting clean


304
0:12:14,0 --> 0:12:15,38
and having a kid.


305
0:12:15,38 --> 0:12:17,35
And I eventually was
able to get clean.


306
0:12:17,35 --> 0:12:20,46



307
0:12:20,46 --> 0:12:24,55
Sonny, my son, has just been the
coolest thing in my life.


308
0:12:24,55 --> 0:12:27,52
Because I think when we were
talking earlier, I said I


309
0:12:27,52 --> 0:12:30,57
could have never imagined having
a kid, and I can't even


310
0:12:30,57 --> 0:12:33,82
imagine what it would be
like to not have him.


311
0:12:33,82 --> 0:12:36,66
And I named him after
Sonny, kind of.


312
0:12:36,66 --> 0:12:40,9
But Sonny was such a notorious
fuck-up, Sonny Tufts, that it


313
0:12:40,9 --> 0:12:42,86
was like, did you name
him after Sonny?


314
0:12:42,86 --> 0:12:45,36
Well, not really.


315
0:12:45,36 --> 0:12:48,233
I really just kind of learned
how much I loved that name and


316
0:12:48,233 --> 0:12:51,16
how endearing it was to me
because of my friend and


317
0:12:51,16 --> 0:12:54,27
because of knowing him so long
and stuff like that.


318
0:12:54,27 --> 0:12:55,37
JASON MCAFEE: I tell
him all the time.


319
0:12:55,37 --> 0:13:0,34
I'm just like, dude, from when I
met you to now, it's insane.


320
0:13:0,34 --> 0:13:4,41
When I met him, he lived three
blocks up in this dark,


321
0:13:4,41 --> 0:13:7,87
shitty, fuckin' depressing
apartment.


322
0:13:7,87 --> 0:13:10,795
it was just this den of, like,
you sat on a couch and you


323
0:13:10,795 --> 0:13:12,36
would melt in it and
almost fall asleep.


324
0:13:12,36 --> 0:13:16,86
I would get there and just be
like, 11:00 in the morning


325
0:13:16,86 --> 0:13:19,48
coming to work, and
I was just--


326
0:13:19,48 --> 0:13:23,53
And just to see where he's come
from to like, getting


327
0:13:23,53 --> 0:13:28,16
married, having a baby, owning
the two successful shops.


328
0:13:28,16 --> 0:13:33,58
His house, his life, he's
changed so, so much.


329
0:13:33,58 --> 0:13:35,9
And definitely, it's Sonny.


330
0:13:35,9 --> 0:13:38,52
Seeing him be a dad
is unbelievable.


331
0:13:38,52 --> 0:13:42,83
I've never seen someone attack
it so strongly and so


332
0:13:42,83 --> 0:13:44,51
passionately and become--


333
0:13:44,51 --> 0:13:48,335



334
0:13:48,335 --> 0:13:49,585
he's a rad dad.


335
0:13:49,585 --> 0:13:52,565



336
0:13:52,565 --> 0:13:53,41
FREDDY CORBIN: Look at you.


337
0:13:53,41 --> 0:13:54,7
There you go.


338
0:13:54,7 --> 0:13:56,43
Do it.


339
0:13:56,43 --> 0:13:58,53
Do it.


340
0:13:58,53 --> 0:13:59,42
Yes.


341
0:13:59,42 --> 0:14:1,86
Yay!


342
0:14:1,86 --> 0:14:3,49
Yeah.


343
0:14:3,49 --> 0:14:6,29
You conquered.


344
0:14:6,29 --> 0:14:8,85
TIM HENDRICKS: It's hard to tame
a free spirit, and he's


345
0:14:8,85 --> 0:14:11,1
the ultimate free spirit.


346
0:14:11,1 --> 0:14:14,8
So I think this is one way of
doing it organically and


347
0:14:14,8 --> 0:14:19,67
naturally, is having a kid
and having a family.


348
0:14:19,67 --> 0:14:20,82
He's still Freddy.


349
0:14:20,82 --> 0:14:22,82
Nothing changed about him.


350
0:14:22,82 --> 0:14:24,84
I admire people like that.


351
0:14:24,84 --> 0:14:27,43
He's an extremely fun time.


352
0:14:27,43 --> 0:14:30,16
Freddy could have fun
in a cardboard box.


353
0:14:30,16 --> 0:14:32,23
MAX SCHAAF: The weirdest
thing to me is, he


354
0:14:32,23 --> 0:14:33,33
goes to Burning Man.


355
0:14:33,33 --> 0:14:36,25
And he's like, it
was insane, bro.


356
0:14:36,25 --> 0:14:38,39
And I never want to
go to Burning Man.


357
0:14:38,39 --> 0:14:41,6
I just don't have any desire to,
but when Freddy tells you


358
0:14:41,6 --> 0:14:42,43
about it you're like, what?


359
0:14:42,43 --> 0:14:43,2
What?


360
0:14:43,2 --> 0:14:45,46
Oh my god, really?


361
0:14:45,46 --> 0:14:48,18
Because he's just that cool.


362
0:14:48,18 --> 0:14:50,31
FREDDY CORBIN: I feel like
Burning Man prepared me for


363
0:14:50,31 --> 0:14:55,28
India, because at Burning
Man, anything goes.


364
0:14:55,28 --> 0:14:58,6
You could be talking to some
really cool fuckin' people


365
0:14:58,6 --> 0:15:1,13
that are just really down, and
the next thing you know you've


366
0:15:1,13 --> 0:15:5,92
got some crazy dude tripping on
acid who's flailing and not


367
0:15:5,92 --> 0:15:8,0
knowing where the fuck
he is, or whatever,


368
0:15:8,0 --> 0:15:10,65
because there's no rules.


369
0:15:10,65 --> 0:15:12,2
And India is the same way.


370
0:15:12,2 --> 0:15:14,36
India is no rules.


371
0:15:14,36 --> 0:15:15,77
We have this term.


372
0:15:15,77 --> 0:15:17,54
It's like, both and.


373
0:15:17,54 --> 0:15:23,61
It's profound, profane, and
then a little bit more.


374
0:15:23,61 --> 0:15:25,43
India is so intense.


375
0:15:25,43 --> 0:15:27,3
You could see a dead person
in the street.


376
0:15:27,3 --> 0:15:27,54
There's lepers.


377
0:15:27,54 --> 0:15:28,58
There's people begging.


378
0:15:28,58 --> 0:15:31,15
There's poor kids begging,
running around


379
0:15:31,15 --> 0:15:32,26
with no pants on.


380
0:15:32,26 --> 0:15:35,17
There's just a lot of poverty.


381
0:15:35,17 --> 0:15:38,79
A cliche that people say is
that India is the most


382
0:15:38,79 --> 0:15:40,655
beautiful and the most
horrific place that


383
0:15:40,655 --> 0:15:41,88
you'll every go.


384
0:15:41,88 --> 0:15:43,29
And it's true.


385
0:15:43,29 --> 0:15:45,72
So you'll be out boating
and you'll see a


386
0:15:45,72 --> 0:15:49,25
carcass floating by.


387
0:15:49,25 --> 0:15:50,77
A bloated human body
will just--


388
0:15:50,77 --> 0:15:54,27
I've seen a dog with a hand in
it's mouth cruising off like,


389
0:15:54,27 --> 0:15:55,94
I got some food.


390
0:15:55,94 --> 0:15:57,44
It's just bizarre.


391
0:15:57,44 --> 0:15:59,94
First time I was there, I was
like, if I stayed at this one


392
0:15:59,94 --> 0:16:4,48
hotel, I could maybe bring
Lisa and her mom here.


393
0:16:4,48 --> 0:16:5,505
Her mom's really cool.


394
0:16:5,505 --> 0:16:9,63
And I'm just like, why am I
wasting my time trying to turn


395
0:16:9,63 --> 0:16:12,26
them on to something that
I think is really cool?


396
0:16:12,26 --> 0:16:15,37
My wife has no desire
to go to India.


397
0:16:15,37 --> 0:16:16,84
It's too dirty for her.


398
0:16:16,84 --> 0:16:18,74
She won't even go camping.


399
0:16:18,74 --> 0:16:22,94
If there's not a toilet,
she's not interested.


400
0:16:22,94 --> 0:16:24,19
LISA CORBIN: Freddy's spiritual
side is very


401
0:16:24,19 --> 0:16:25,99
separate from our
relationship.


402
0:16:25,99 --> 0:16:28,7
It's not something that we
share or do together.


403
0:16:28,7 --> 0:16:34,48
So his trips to India, or
Burning Man, or Brazil, or the


404
0:16:34,48 --> 0:16:38,85
tea ceremonies, or the parties
that he goes to, like the


405
0:16:38,85 --> 0:16:40,57
alchemy parties.


406
0:16:40,57 --> 0:16:44,0
Freddy, I think, maybe got
opened up to different things,


407
0:16:44,0 --> 0:16:47,97
but I think he's always
been a spiritual.


408
0:16:47,97 --> 0:16:51,81
JASON MCAFEE: His spiritual side
is, all over the place,


409
0:16:51,81 --> 0:16:53,78
in a good way.


410
0:16:53,78 --> 0:16:56,5
I think Freddy believes and
dabbles in a little


411
0:16:56,5 --> 0:16:59,5
bit of all of it.


412
0:16:59,5 --> 0:17:1,12
There's obviously a lot Jesuses
here and a lot of


413
0:17:1,12 --> 0:17:2,54
Christian stuff and
all this stuff.


414
0:17:2,54 --> 0:17:5,76
And he even sometimes will say
that's what he is and what he


415
0:17:5,76 --> 0:17:7,29
does, is he's a Christian.


416
0:17:7,29 --> 0:17:12,55
But he believes so much in
Buddha and all these other


417
0:17:12,55 --> 0:17:15,73
kinds of religions and forms
of religion that I think he


418
0:17:15,73 --> 0:17:19,28
takes pieces from all of it.


419
0:17:19,28 --> 0:17:21,92
He's definitely got a
lot of spirituality.


420
0:17:21,92 --> 0:17:26,27
Wherever it comes from, I
couldn't really pinpoint.


421
0:17:26,27 --> 0:17:28,45
FREDDY CORBIN: I don't feel
bound by any dogma of any


422
0:17:28,45 --> 0:17:29,74
religion whatsoever.


423
0:17:29,74 --> 0:17:34,93
And I consider myself a
Christian because I'm down for


424
0:17:34,93 --> 0:17:39,82
Jesus and I believe in what he
was here for, as well as


425
0:17:39,82 --> 0:17:43,8
Buddha or Martin Luther
King or Gandhi or


426
0:17:43,8 --> 0:17:45,83
anybody of that nature.


427
0:17:45,83 --> 0:17:49,21
I'm just kind of into
positive energy.


428
0:17:49,21 --> 0:17:51,45
And I think we're all God's
fuckin' children.


429
0:17:51,45 --> 0:17:54,485
We're all brothers and sisters
no matter what religious sect


430
0:17:54,485 --> 0:17:57,905
or color or size or
sex or whatever.


431
0:17:57,905 --> 0:18:1,13



432
0:18:1,13 --> 0:18:3,41
Huh, Son?


433
0:18:3,41 --> 0:18:4,66
And don't trust the
government.


434
0:18:4,66 --> 0:18:10,17



435
0:18:10,17 --> 0:18:12,1
LISA CORBIN: I think, actually,
when Freddy's


436
0:18:12,1 --> 0:18:17,5
brother passed away because
of his involvement in his


437
0:18:17,5 --> 0:18:20,6
spirituality, it really helped
them through it.


438
0:18:20,6 --> 0:18:24,27
Because I think that he was in
a place where he was able to


439
0:18:24,27 --> 0:18:29,47
accept it and felt that it was
maybe the universe had


440
0:18:29,47 --> 0:18:35,7
actually let things happen
in a way that was best.


441
0:18:35,7 --> 0:18:42,25
He handled it in a way, I think,
that was the best--


442
0:18:42,25 --> 0:18:44,55
I don't know.


443
0:18:44,55 --> 0:18:47,51
He got through it and I think
he got through it because of


444
0:18:47,51 --> 0:18:49,25
what he believes in.


445
0:18:49,25 --> 0:18:52,22
And it didn't send him over
the edge, because a lot of


446
0:18:52,22 --> 0:18:53,4
those things--


447
0:18:53,4 --> 0:18:53,85
Freddy lives on the edge.


448
0:18:53,85 --> 0:18:55,95
A lot of us have lived
on the edge.


449
0:18:55,95 --> 0:18:57,1
And it's one of those things.


450
0:18:57,1 --> 0:18:58,7
Death can be one of
those things that


451
0:18:58,7 --> 0:19:0,94
might put you there.


452
0:19:0,94 --> 0:19:2,86
FREDDY CORBIN: My brother
was kind of a lone wolf.


453
0:19:2,86 --> 0:19:7,51
I was one of his few friends so
I decided to do his funeral


454
0:19:7,51 --> 0:19:11,68
on the Ganges, just take his
ashes to India and do it


455
0:19:11,68 --> 0:19:14,29
there, do his little
funeral there.


456
0:19:14,29 --> 0:19:18,17
And it's-- they call
it a puja.


457
0:19:18,17 --> 0:19:21,87
So you do a puja for the dead
and then you do a puja for the


458
0:19:21,87 --> 0:19:24,11
people that you love
that are alive.


459
0:19:24,11 --> 0:19:26,87
And so the first day was a lot
of burning, and certain


460
0:19:26,87 --> 0:19:30,2
incense and smoke and stuff.


461
0:19:30,2 --> 0:19:34,36
And then the ones for your
living loved ones, a lot of


462
0:19:34,36 --> 0:19:35,92
flowers, water.


463
0:19:35,92 --> 0:19:40,6
The living day one, I had to
hold this pitcher of water


464
0:19:40,6 --> 0:19:43,38
over the shiva lingam, which is
basically like a penis and


465
0:19:43,38 --> 0:19:44,95
vagina statue.


466
0:19:44,95 --> 0:19:48,22
It represents fertility
and the cycle of life.


467
0:19:48,22 --> 0:19:51,1
I had to pour this huge pitcher
of water over it.


468
0:19:51,1 --> 0:19:53,86
They fill it up and then
I'd have to hold it.


469
0:19:53,86 --> 0:19:55,45
And then they fill
it up again.


470
0:19:55,45 --> 0:19:58,13
And by the third time, I'm
kind of holding my arm.


471
0:19:58,13 --> 0:20:0,17
I came home and I said to Lisa--
because she had been


472
0:20:0,17 --> 0:20:2,38
wanting to get pregnant
for a while.


473
0:20:2,38 --> 0:20:5,29
I came home and I said to Lisa,
I said, well, if you're


474
0:20:5,29 --> 0:20:7,5
ever going to get pregnant,
it's going to happen now,


475
0:20:7,5 --> 0:20:10,16
babe, because I had to hold this
penis water thing over


476
0:20:10,16 --> 0:20:11,81
these flowers.


477
0:20:11,81 --> 0:20:13,46
And I was just kind of
joking about it.


478
0:20:13,46 --> 0:20:19,45
And she said, well, if I get
pregnant, I'll turn Hindu.


479
0:20:19,45 --> 0:20:20,71
She literally said that.


480
0:20:20,71 --> 0:20:23,4
And right after we got married
and got locked into this


481
0:20:23,4 --> 0:20:26,52
house, she turns up pregnant.


482
0:20:26,52 --> 0:20:31,95
And I'm convinced that
definitely helped.


483
0:20:31,95 --> 0:20:34,35
I'm not saying that was
the cause of it.


484
0:20:34,35 --> 0:20:36,6
Obviously, sperm had a
lot to do with it.


485
0:20:36,6 --> 0:20:41,43
But I think stuff like that
helps, and my beliefs.


486
0:20:41,43 --> 0:20:43,92
That intention is a big part
of anything that we do.


487
0:20:43,92 --> 0:20:47,82



488
0:20:47,82 --> 0:20:49,7
Peel it.


489
0:20:49,7 --> 0:20:51,42



490
0:20:51,42 --> 0:20:52,92
All right.


491
0:20:52,92 --> 0:20:53,82
That was cool.


492
0:20:53,82 --> 0:22:53,82
