1
0:0:0,49 --> 0:0:4,27
today they were voting on background
checks on the government robo has


2
0:0:4,27 --> 0:0:8,219
already incredibly watered down is not
universal background checks


3
0:0:8,219 --> 0:0:10,269
there was johnnie loopholes in it


4
0:0:10,269 --> 0:0:13,389
and uh... then they want to add more
loopholes


5
0:0:13,389 --> 0:0:16,859
now normal isn't having that passes
actually


6
0:0:16,859 --> 0:0:20,819
bless your heart snow a lot of you out
there were saying oh aging sebi adrian b


7
0:0:20,819 --> 0:0:23,19
he got this right he said that


8
0:0:23,19 --> 0:0:25,289
uh... gun control laws in the past


9
0:0:25,289 --> 0:0:28,32
well to be fair that's only half true


10
0:0:28,32 --> 0:0:31,259
uh... i fought the assault-weapons ban
was going to pass of course is that he


11
0:0:31,259 --> 0:0:32,49
got crotch


12
0:0:32,49 --> 0:0:34,2
on a forty votes


13
0:0:34,2 --> 0:0:36,64
freer tho busted even have a filibuster


14
0:0:36,64 --> 0:0:37,82
and then uh...


15
0:0:37,82 --> 0:0:41,8
uh... high-capacity magzine that i said
that was in the past


16
0:0:41,8 --> 0:0:42,719
net income goes either


17
0:0:42,719 --> 0:0:47,0
i got about forty six votes that also
didn't get a majority soda all i was


18
0:0:47,0 --> 0:0:48,95
sure right about that stuff


19
0:0:48,95 --> 0:0:52,5
but i actually thought and i was i even
of at some point i guess i think the


20
0:0:52,5 --> 0:0:53,72
background checks


21
0:0:53,72 --> 0:0:55,39
would be a fig leaf


22
0:0:55,39 --> 0:0:58,73
that they would say all right here you
go get some background checks nine new


23
0:0:58,73 --> 0:0:59,889
much anyway


24
0:0:59,889 --> 0:1:2,289
well you know we kill the relevant
portions the spell


25
0:1:2,289 --> 0:1:5,28
and that it would be you know obama
moment it with a mission accomplished up


26
0:1:5,28 --> 0:1:9,98
their and that's a historic gun control
legislation


27
0:1:9,98 --> 0:1:12,23
and particularly i fought back


28
0:1:12,23 --> 0:1:14,96
because bloomberg came to a twelve
million dollars


29
0:1:14,96 --> 0:1:18,5
now twelve million dollars makes a lot
of nevers and politics is pressuring you


30
0:1:18,5 --> 0:1:19,21
run ads against


31
0:1:19,21 --> 0:1:23,26
certain politicians apparently they
haven't gotten that memo yet


32
0:1:23,26 --> 0:1:25,73
they definitely got that are a mammal


33
0:1:25,73 --> 0:1:29,189
because then or is this thing out money
for decades


34
0:1:29,189 --> 0:1:32,6
now things might turn around a couple
years i'll tell you i am i turn around


35
0:1:32,6 --> 0:1:36,84
in my body and a couple years two things
that happen


36
0:1:36,84 --> 0:1:40,32
those bloomberg ads are gonna run and
then the politicians are gonna start to


37
0:1:40,32 --> 0:1:41,64
feel the pain of that


38
0:1:41,64 --> 0:1:43,89
and it's already become immediate to
them


39
0:1:43,89 --> 0:1:47,79
animator dot all man all i didn't know
you have that much money


40
0:1:47,79 --> 0:1:51,57
whether there are a had more money okay
my battles which my book


41
0:1:51,57 --> 0:1:53,299
the same thing that's going to happen is


42
0:1:53,299 --> 0:1:54,96
base root out today


43
0:1:54,96 --> 0:1:56,79
so uh... the main


44
0:1:56,79 --> 0:2:2,62
background check by board of drums up
compromise obviously didn't pass right


45
0:2:2,62 --> 0:2:4,36
why is that a screw-up


46
0:2:4,36 --> 0:2:7,77
because you're supposed to put a fig
leaf on a this is how washington


47
0:2:7,77 --> 0:2:8,979
normally works


48
0:2:8,979 --> 0:2:12,389
and say we solve it and move on


49
0:2:12,389 --> 0:2:16,64
but you didn't do that so what happened
was anger


50
0:2:16,64 --> 0:2:20,51
live so they're trying to cut the same
time anything into it


51
0:2:20,51 --> 0:2:21,48
hang on this


52
0:2:21,48 --> 0:2:23,82
it's the n_r_a_ overplaying their hand


53
0:2:23,82 --> 0:2:26,969
the bill was already incredibly weak


54
0:2:26,969 --> 0:2:28,87
you should have just take it


55
0:2:28,87 --> 0:2:31,489
instead you jump the shark


56
0:2:31,489 --> 0:2:34,509
there's signifi enter in the country now
look


57
0:2:34,509 --> 0:2:35,89
it stretches out


58
0:2:35,89 --> 0:2:41,64
across everyone but it started at this
moment when buying city and of course as


59
0:2:41,64 --> 0:2:44,82
the head of the senate businesses role
but he does time to time as the vice


60
0:2:44,82 --> 0:2:45,799
president


61
0:2:45,799 --> 0:2:47,779
uh... ceremony only


62
0:2:47,779 --> 0:2:52,839
uh... window votes were announcers what

63
0:2:52,839 --> 0:2:57,909

64
0:2:57,909 --> 0:2:59,389

0:2:59,389 --> 0:3:1,95
on his vote the yeas are fifty four


66
0:3:1,95 --> 0:3:5,64
the nature of forty-six under the
previous order requiring sixty votes


67
0:3:5,64 --> 0:3:7,939
reduction in this amendment


68
0:3:7,939 --> 0:3:9,209
the amendment


69
0:3:9,209 --> 0:3:11,43
is not agreed to


70
0:3:11,43 --> 0:3:13,959
it not been reading but i got your name


71
0:3:13,959 --> 0:3:19,459
who cares majority doesn't rule anymore
the minority rules because harried in


72
0:3:19,459 --> 0:3:22,55
his infinite stupidity didn't fix a
filibuster


73
0:3:22,55 --> 0:3:26,65
hindu reform on that not meeting for for
what he did it at that link report

80
0:3:44,69 --> 0:3:46,89
so even though they have plenty of all
it's a passenger or any


81
0:3:46,89 --> 0:3:49,319
it got killed anyway that's when


82
0:3:49,319 --> 0:3:51,409
uh... two women in vertigo started


83
0:3:51,409 --> 0:3:52,43

show shea


86

who's stopping jhrlaw funner


88
0:4:0,349 --> 0:4:3,259
from grabbing his third clap


89
0:4:3,259 --> 0:4:5,719
she's a hero tucson arizona

0:4:5,719 --> 0:4:9,339
they always say like our differences and
they have any both are in a magazine


91
0:4:9,339 --> 0:4:14,89
or guns don't kill people well patricia
may says that that's not true


92
0:4:14,89 --> 0:4:17,9
i saw on my own eyes the war does he
have a more bullets he had killed more


93
0:4:17,9 --> 0:4:21,959
people he killed she knows she's the one
at the concert magazine away

starters hussein issue should be ashamed


97

from the rafters right


98
0:4:30,879 --> 0:4:33,599
there of course escort her out of the
chamber


99
0:4:33,599 --> 0:4:37,36
and in the capital poisonous for out of
the building when reporters definite


100
0:4:37,36 --> 0:4:41,689
and what what the police do and they
talked her here's what she says


101
0:4:41,689 --> 0:4:42,98
when i was told


102
0:4:42,98 --> 0:4:44,19
it was done


103
0:4:44,19 --> 0:4:46,49
i decided that i could not stay


104
0:4:46,49 --> 0:4:47,969
still any longer


105
0:4:47,969 --> 0:4:50,38
that they needed to be ashamed of
themselves


106
0:4:50,38 --> 0:4:52,249
they have no souls


107
0:4:52,249 --> 0:4:53,689
they have no compassion


108
0:4:53,689 --> 0:4:55,949
for the experiences that people have
lived through


109
0:4:55,949 --> 0:4:59,739
having a child or loved one murdered by
a gun


110
0:4:59,739 --> 0:5:0,999
issue and i must say


111
0:5:0,999 --> 0:5:4,129
there are nim barris man to our country


112
0:5:4,129 --> 0:5:7,629
as giving that's harsh way to get a
lotta gabby giffords


113
0:5:7,629 --> 0:5:10,319
she's of course a congresswoman was shot
mad


114
0:5:10,319 --> 0:5:14,65
and she did not pull back either she put
out a statement say moments ago the u_s_


115
0:5:14,65 --> 0:5:18,209
senate decided to do the unthinkable
about gun violence


116
0:5:18,209 --> 0:5:19,169
nothing


117
0:5:19,169 --> 0:5:20,71
at all


118
0:5:20,71 --> 0:5:22,479
he went on to say


119
0:5:22,479 --> 0:5:24,269
over two years ago


120
0:5:24,269 --> 0:5:27,99
when i was shot point-blank in their
head


121
0:5:27,99 --> 0:5:30,759
the u_s_ senate shows and do nothing


122
0:5:30,759 --> 0:5:33,759
four months ago twenty first graders
lost their lives


123
0:5:33,759 --> 0:5:35,72
and a brutal attack on their school


124
0:5:35,72 --> 0:5:39,159
and the u_s_ senate shows to do nothing


125
0:5:39,159 --> 0:5:41,56
it's clear to me that members of the
u_s_ senate


126
0:5:41,56 --> 0:5:43,21
refused to change the laws


127
0:5:43,21 --> 0:5:46,21
to reduce gun violence then we need to
change


128
0:5:46,21 --> 0:5:48,36
the members of the u_s_ senate


129
0:5:48,36 --> 0:5:49,569
damn straight


130
0:5:49,569 --> 0:5:51,819
but that's my khana language


131
0:5:51,819 --> 0:5:52,84
you either


132
0:5:52,84 --> 0:5:55,33
get a lot of ninety one percent of the
country


133
0:5:55,33 --> 0:5:57,809
when you get the hell out of the this
place


134
0:5:57,809 --> 0:6:1,77
that this is what we need to spend money
time energy resources


135
0:6:1,77 --> 0:6:6,439
to make sure but the people who voted
against this bill that they'd leave


136
0:6:6,439 --> 0:6:8,39
politically


137
0:6:8,39 --> 0:6:9,39
politically


138
0:6:9,39 --> 0:6:10,669
we go to get them


139
0:6:10,669 --> 0:6:12,84
well that pitchfork


140
0:6:12,84 --> 0:6:16,7
and if it takes bloomberg's miami you
grab bloomberg's money


141
0:6:16,7 --> 0:6:17,749
everything's getting different safe


142
0:6:17,749 --> 0:6:20,699
shame on you i got shot on the head


143
0:6:20,699 --> 0:6:22,56
out your fellow congresswoman


144
0:6:22,56 --> 0:6:25,27
i got shot padding you didn't know
anything about it


145
0:6:25,27 --> 0:6:27,539
well then that's what we know s


146
0:6:27,539 --> 0:6:29,56
this isn't coming for your guns


147
0:6:29,56 --> 0:6:31,229
this is the simplest


148
0:6:31,229 --> 0:6:33,129
piece of legislation


149
0:6:33,129 --> 0:6:37,28
hate week you can just buy a gun without
doing a background check


150
0:6:37,28 --> 0:6:39,949
we need to know what your credibility or
terrorist


151
0:6:39,949 --> 0:6:43,489
but there are a so strong it doesn't
matter you can buy a gun even if you're


152
0:6:43,489 --> 0:6:46,34
on the terrorist watchlist did you know
that


153
0:6:46,34 --> 0:6:49,449
that's why it because it ad already has
this


154
0:6:49,449 --> 0:6:53,329
congress lock stock and barrel they got
locked up


155
0:6:53,329 --> 0:6:56,449
and they shot it today


156
0:6:56,449 --> 0:6:57,36
ashamed


157
0:6:57,36 --> 0:7:2,129
at the very least they should be ashamed


158
0:7:2,129 --> 0:7:4,699
so now were nowhere


159
0:7:4,699 --> 0:7:8,61
nowhere we've gotten awfully


160
0:7:8,61 --> 0:7:12,399
but that andrew will rise and now let me
tell you the third reason


161
0:7:12,399 --> 0:7:15,489
why they will eventually lose on this


162
0:7:15,489 --> 0:7:19,2
because unfortunately there will be
another tragedy


163
0:7:19,2 --> 0:7:21,71
solely a matter of time


164
0:7:21,71 --> 0:7:24,409
the mass shootings keep on coming in


165
0:7:24,409 --> 0:7:26,919
i wish that hell they didn't


166
0:7:26,919 --> 0:7:28,189
but they do


167
0:7:28,189 --> 0:7:30,11
you think there won't be another


168
0:7:30,11 --> 0:7:32,13
horrible tragic nationally


169
0:7:32,13 --> 0:7:35,69
and you think it won't happen relatively
soon


170
0:7:35,69 --> 0:7:38,61
you they would have to wait a couple of
years i wish we waited forever and never


171
0:7:38,61 --> 0:7:40,439
happen again


172
0:7:40,439 --> 0:7:44,44
but it's gonna happen again and again
that and again


173
0:7:44,44 --> 0:7:46,99
and then the next time


174
0:7:46,99 --> 0:7:47,509
you wanna cnr


175
0:7:47,509 --> 0:7:50,439
is going to be real anger


176
0:7:50,439 --> 0:7:52,79
because you know why


177
0:7:52,79 --> 0:7:55,61
you didn't do the one thing you're
supposed to do most of all


178
0:7:55,61 --> 0:7:58,509
you're supposed to protect the citizens


179
0:7:58,509 --> 0:8:0,399
protecting the citizens isn't


180
0:8:0,399 --> 0:8:3,929
going in and being a country like iraq
had been the packers


181
0:8:3,929 --> 0:8:6,76
starting senseless war so defense
contractors


182
0:8:6,76 --> 0:8:9,71
an auto companies gain get paid in get
rich


183
0:8:9,71 --> 0:8:11,33
protecting our sentences


184
0:8:11,33 --> 0:8:13,65
is making sure that what young kids


185
0:8:13,65 --> 0:8:15,659
don't get shot and killed in a


186
0:8:15,659 --> 0:8:17,629
classes they went to


187
0:8:17,629 --> 0:8:20,9
it's pretty it


188
0:8:20,9 --> 0:8:23,25
something you're not only for becca
gotten stable from getting shot of the


189
0:8:23,25 --> 0:8:25,2
head


190
0:8:25,2 --> 0:8:29,45
you know as all these people are saying
uganda has had you know she


191
0:8:29,45 --> 0:8:31,16
but the answer is obvious


192
0:8:31,16 --> 0:8:32,76
of course they don't


193
0:8:32,76 --> 0:8:36,5
of course they don't all they care about
is


194
0:8:36,5 --> 0:8:38,19
who signs my checks


195
0:8:38,19 --> 0:8:42,62
and if there are a signing my checks i
don't give a damn who gets murdered


196
0:8:42,62 --> 0:10:42,62
that's what the boat was about today
