###1 CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: A royal rule changed, the possibility of invisibility, and a fighter
###5 who is fighting back against bullying. That`s just some of what we are talking about today
###9 on CNN STUDENT NEWS.
###17 A lot of young people are out looking for a job, but not working one. A new report says
###29 youth employment in the U.S. is at its lowest level since the Second World War. We are talking
###35 about people ages 16 to 24. The Annie E. Casey Foundation says that only half of them had
###40 jobs in 2011, and if you just look at teenagers, only one in four had a job last year. In the
###46 year 2000 almost half of them did. The reasons - the lingering effects of the great recession.
###52 A lot of the entry level jobs the young people used to count on like those at clothing stores
###57 or restaurants, for example, are going to more experienced or more educated workers.
###62 One side effect is that young people aren`t getting the early work experience that would
###66 help them later on.
###68 Some organizations want to give students the chance to get that experience, but not through
###73 job - at school, and not during regular classes either. This is part of something called the
###77 time collaborative, and for around 20,000 students it means they are going to be spending
###82 more time at school. We are talking about more than 40 schools in five states. Next
###87 school year, they are going to be open an additional 300 hours, so it works out to about
###92 90 minutes extra a day on average. It won`t necessarily mean more time in science or language
###99 arts classes, though that it`s possible. The organizers say the extra time could be spent
###103 on internships, on apprenticeships or music or arts programs. One goal would be to help
###109 low performing students do better. An analyst says the program could help increase test
###115 scores, but it can also increase dropout rates. He said that if the extra time looks and feels
###120 like the rest of the school day, then those at-risk students might not go for it.
###126 A middle schooler who spoke to one of our affiliates said students don`t want more time
###130 in school. She said students want to get a break from learning. What do you say? We want
###134 to hear your thoughts on this. Let`s say your school adds the extra time, an extra hour
###139 and a half. How would you want to spend it? More academics, the focus on music and drama
###143 programs, getting internship or apprenticeship credit. Tell us and tell us only your first
###148 names on our blog cnnstudentnews.com.

###153 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: See, if you can I.D. me. I was born in London in 1926 and I still
###161 live there. I have a royal title, but I don`t actually run my country`s government. I ascended
###166 to the throne in 1952.
###170 I`m the United Kingdom`s Queen Elizabeth II, and I have one younger sister, but no brothers.
###180 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###182 AZUZ: Now, here is why that last part`s important. If Queen Elizabeth did have any brothers,
###187 even if they were younger than she, she wouldn`t be queen. It all has to do with the order
###192 of succession. In the U.S. , succession has to do with who takes over as president if
###196 something happens to the current president. Well, for the British monarchy, succession
###200 is about who becomes king or queen. This is Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge. She is married
###206 to Prince William, Queen Elizabeth`s grandson and the couple is expecting a baby. Now, you
###211 might have heard about that. Right now, the British order of succession goes from the
###215 queen to William`s dad, Prince Charles, and then to Prince William. For more than 300
###221 years, the law said that a monarch`s first born son was heir to the throne. If he had
###225 big sisters, he jumped in line ahead of them. But the royal rules of succession are changing.
###232 From now on, the firstborn child will be heir, so William and Catherine`s baby will be next
###238 in line for the throne and it won`t matter whether it`s a boy or girl.
###243 Just eight days left for you to send us an "I-Report" and maybe get a place on our show.
###247 We want to know how are you celebrating the season of giving. You have to be at least
###251 13 years old. The video has to be 30 seconds or less, and no music, just you and the camera.
###257 Please make sure to watch for our email. After you submit your video, you get all the details

###266 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today`s "Shoutout" goes out to Mrs. Ross` CWP class at Eastmont High
###273 School in East Wenatchee, Washington.
###277 The word "camouflage" comes from what language. You know what to do, is it Latin, Celtic,
###283 Greek or French? You`ve got three seconds, go!
###293 Camouflage comes from a French word that means "to disguise." That`s your answer and that`s
###299 your "Shoutout."
###300 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###302 AZUZ: And that`s what camouflage is meant to do: to disguise. Usually military troops
###308 or their equipment although you probably know somebody who just like to wear it from time
###312 to time. Now, you know camo when you see it. You might think that the patterns in it are
###316 kind of random, but that`s actually not the case. Chris Lawrence explains why there`s
###321 a lot to look at when you are designing clothing to make people disappear.
###324 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###325 CHRIS LAWRENCE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: A lot is riding on the next generation design to outfit
###329 troops. It`s only been eight years since the Army spent $5 billion on camo that critics
###335 say didn`t fool anyone. Soldiers complained to the point the Army abandoned its one size
###341 fits all universal pattern.
###343 (on camera): So, they were looking for camouflage that they could use everywhere.
###346 GUY CRAMER, HYPER STEALTH/ADS: Correct. And it didn`t work anywhere.
###350 LAWRENCE: Guy Cramer is one of the designers competing to win the Army`s next multimillion
###354 dollar contract. This summer, he showed us the science behind every shape, size and shade
###361 of these pixels.
###361 (on camera): You now have your camouflage.
###365 CRAMER: So we are trying to trick the brain into seeing things that aren`t actually there.
###368 LAWRENCE (voice over): Digital patterns recreate shapes already found in nature. And 3-D layering
###374 creates depth and shadows where non exist. That`s today`s design. But developers already
###381 have one eye on tomorrow.
###383 CRAMER: What`s coming up down the road, and very quickly, is the Harry Potter cloak.
###388 RUPERT GRINT, ACTOR: What is that?
###389 LAWRENCE: With that fictional cloak, Harry isn`t just camouflage, he is invisible.
###393 DANIEL RADCLIFFE, ACTOR: My body is gone!
###395 LAWRENCE (on camera): How invisible are we talking here? If I walk into a room with the
###402 soldier wearing one of these cloaks?
###404 CRAMER: You wouldn`t see him at all. He would be completely invisible to you.
###409 LAWRENCE (voice over): This is not make believe. The military has seen the so-called quantum
###413 stealth technology. It works by banding the light around an object, even concealing most
###419 of a person shadow. Imagine what that could do for a sniper hiding in the field or the
###425 American pilots who ejected over Libya when their fighter jets crashed last year.
###430 CRAMER: They could actually pull out very similar to what they carry with a survival
###434 blanket, throw it over top of them. And unless you walked right into them, you wouldn`t know
###439 that they were there.
###440 LAWRENCE: So, what was once firmly in the world of make believe, could quickly become
###445 quite real.
###445 (END VIDEOTAPE)
###446 AZUZ: All right, and this one is going to sound a little strange at first: a plan to
###450 stop bullying by encouraging fighting. It makes a little more sense when you find out
###454 that one of the program`s organizers is a mixed martial arts` champion, and his goal
###459 is to keep fighting in the ring instead of at his school. Have a look.
###463 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###465 ROB MCCULLOUGH: Hey, I`m Rob McCullough, and we can make an impact on bullying. This campaign
###474 is about anti-bullying and it`s about the epidemic that`s going on nowadays in our schools.
###479 And it`s about kids being picked on, kids, you know, being bullied and for them to find
###484 a safe haven through sports. Anti-bullying is similar to what we are doing with L.A.
###490 Boxing. We go to schools in neighboring areas that we have gyms, so that we know that there
###494 is a safe haven for these kids to go to.
###496 I dealt with bullying growing up as a kid, because I was always the new guy at the school.
###501 I was always moving.
###502 The message I`m trying to convey to these kids at the assemblies is that with a little
###508 hard work and motivation and a positive mental attitude, you can, you know, you can literally
###513 do anything you want to do.
###516 Some of the people that we`ve had do assemblies with us, is Dana White, the president of the
###522 UFC, TRT`s Michael Bisping, Rampage Quinton Jackson. The list goes on. We are not fighting
###528 because we don`t like each other or because we are bullying each other, we are fighting
###531 because it`s a sport. Sport did that for me, and it did that for a lot of my friends that
###534 are professional athletes.
###535 It gives you something to focus on.
###538 Join the movement, impact your world.
###541 (END VIDEOTAPE)

###547 Your World" link on our home page. Our last story today is sweet. It`s a gingerbread house.
###554 It`s the White House. It`s both. It`s the work of a woman in Alabama who calls herself
###558 "the gingerbread lady. Normally, it takes her about 12 hours to finish one of her confectionary
###563 creations. This one took 12 days. OK, it might just be a replica of a real life building,
###570 but it`s filled with a lot of personal touches, so it`s definitely not just like some cookie
###574 cutter copy. We don`t know how much it would sell for, but making it probably took a lot
###578 of dough and the story delicious, getting to make puns at the end, that`s just the icing
###583 on the house, yo. I hope you enjoy the rest of your day. For CNN STUDENT NEWS, I`m Carl
###586 Azuz.
