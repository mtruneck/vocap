RICHARD FREEMAN: We're here on
the banks of the River Lea,


4
0:0:19,78 --> 0:0:23,29
where something has been
attacking and killing full


5
0:0:23,29 --> 0:0:25,99
grown Canada geese, which
are big, powerful birds.


6
0:0:25,99 --> 0:0:30,27
It's interesting that at the
time of the Olympics, we have


7
0:0:30,27 --> 0:0:32,9
an Olympic monster
in the river.

Hi.

to meet you.

to discuss the great Olympic

monster of the River Lea.

RICHARD FREEMAN: Yes,
well, fascinating.


15
0:0:40,885 --> 0:0:43,28
So what was it you
saw, and when?


16
0:0:43,28 --> 0:0:46,39
MIKE WELLS: We were sat on the
back deck of my boat, and


17
0:0:46,39 --> 0:0:48,25
there were a group
of Canada geese.


18
0:0:48,25 --> 0:0:49,83
And there was one goose
a little bit


19
0:0:49,83 --> 0:0:51,3
separated from the group.


20
0:0:51,3 --> 0:0:55,76
Suddenly, this goose
went vertically


21
0:0:55,76 --> 0:0:56,75
down into the water.


22
0:0:56,75 --> 0:1:0,93
Me and Steve kind of looked at
each other in amazement, and


23
0:1:0,93 --> 0:1:3,2
we were kind of looking to
see if it reappeared.


24
0:1:3,2 --> 0:1:4,48
RICHARD FREEMAN: There have
been a number of theories


25
0:1:4,48 --> 0:1:7,32
about what the creature in the
River Lea is, some of them


26
0:1:7,32 --> 0:1:8,73
more fanciful than others.


27
0:1:8,73 --> 0:1:11,75
Some people have suggested
crocodiles and alligators.


28
0:1:11,75 --> 0:1:13,78
These are tropical reptiles.


29
0:1:13,78 --> 0:1:16,2
And they are formidable beasts,
they can kill full


30
0:1:16,2 --> 0:1:18,28
grown tigers, but they're not
going to be found in the


31
0:1:18,28 --> 0:1:19,66
middle of London.


32
0:1:19,66 --> 0:1:21,7

Same with pythons.


34
0:1:23,7 --> 0:1:27,81
I investigated a very similar
case in Lancashire in 2002.


35
0:1:27,81 --> 0:1:30,46
Witnesses there said there was
something the size of a car


36
0:1:30,46 --> 0:1:33,58
swimming around, attacking
full grown swans.


37
0:1:33,58 --> 0:1:36,38
And I was saying to my
colleague, there is no way a


38
0:1:36,38 --> 0:1:37,77
big predator can live
in this lake.


39
0:1:37,77 --> 0:1:38,79
There's no way.


40
0:1:38,79 --> 0:1:41,47
Half an hour later, I was eating
my words, because I saw


41
0:1:41,47 --> 0:1:44,97
it come to the surface no more
than six feet away from me,


42
0:1:44,97 --> 0:1:46,75

river or not, I don't know.


46
0:1:52,87 --> 0:1:56,6
The river starts in Luton, and
it ends up in the Thames, so


47
0:1:56,6 --> 0:1:57,34
the creature could
be anywhere.


48
0:1:57,34 --> 0:2:0,5
It's a tradition to give
monsters names.


49
0:2:0,5 --> 0:2:2,4
The Loch Ness monster
is called Nessie.


50
0:2:2,4 --> 0:2:4,5
The monster of Loch Morag
is called Morag.


51
0:2:4,5 --> 0:2:7,78
The monster of Lake Okanagan
in Canada is Ogopogo.

FEMALE SPEAKER: So another
fallacy of the Green Games is


57
0:2:27,89 --> 0:2:30,9
what's actually happening to
places like Leyton Marshes,


58
0:2:30,9 --> 0:2:32,35
which is, if you've ever been
there, it's one of those parts


59
0:2:32,35 --> 0:2:34,42
of London that makes you think
that you're not actually in


60
0:2:34,42 --> 0:2:36,94
London, if you ignore
the pile up.


61
0:2:36,94 --> 0:2:39,53
So when they started digging all
this green land up, they


62
0:2:39,53 --> 0:2:41,22
suddenly went, oh, there's a
reason why there's been mounds


63
0:2:41,22 --> 0:2:43,4
of earth and piles of
earth on top of it.


64
0:2:43,4 --> 0:2:45,47
It's because there's a lot of
asbestos from the buildings


65
0:2:45,47 --> 0:2:47,2
from before the Second
World War.


66
0:2:47,2 --> 0:2:48,91
Oh, dear, this is a problem.


67
0:2:48,91 --> 0:2:50,64
And the other thing they've done
to that now is because


68
0:2:50,64 --> 0:2:52,53
it's a greenfield site-- don't
know if you know what a


69
0:2:52,53 --> 0:2:55,65
greenfield site is, but it's
a patch of land that hasn't


70
0:2:55,65 --> 0:2:57,17
actually been developed on--


71
0:2:57,17 --> 0:2:59,12
once you've put a temporary
structure like a basketball


72
0:2:59,12 --> 0:3:1,82
court on there, it suddenly
become a Brownfield site.


73
0:3:1,82 --> 0:3:4,5
So it sets this legal precedent,
which then means


74
0:3:4,5 --> 0:3:7,18
you can then sell that land
and the sky above it for

It's the opposite
of what it says.

0:4:12,35 --> 0:4:15,75
So you see a big sign saying,
improving the image of

ripping some building down and

digging a major hole
in the ground.


100

the image of destruction, and

means degeneration.

The games were started
in 1612.


111

pig and attempting to sing
at the same time.


124
0:5:30,36 --> 0:5:32,13
Well, it's a piglet, really,
rather than a pig, but if you


125
0:5:32,13 --> 0:5:34,84
imagine the piglet, it's going
to wriggle quite a lot, and so


126
0:5:34,84 --> 0:5:36,242
you've got to try and
hold it while

traditional English backsword
such as this, which is the

steel sword, obviously when
you're training to sword


134
0:5:52,725 --> 0:5:57,52
fight, it's a very dangerous
art and skill to learn.


135
0:5:57,52 --> 0:5:59,36
So traditionally, people
would use a wooden

157

There's certainly some other

think you could quite
easily replace.


159
0:6:53,73 --> 0:6:56,41
Probably synchronized

the more compelling evidence

a pesticide factory, Union


200
0:8:49,15 --> 0:8:51,27
Carbide owned pesticide
factory in Bhopal.


201
0:8:51,27 --> 0:8:54,66
This was a factory that was in
a very poor state, and it's


202
0:8:54,66 --> 0:8:56,59
true to say that even the
safety systems had been


203
0:8:56,59 --> 0:8:57,27
switched off.


204
0:8:57,27 --> 0:8:59,2
So unfortunately, the
people there didn't


205
0:8:59,2 --> 0:9:0,45
stand much of a chance.


206
0:9:0,45 --> 0:9:3,4
The gas was incredibly
poisonous.


207
0:9:3,4 --> 0:9:5,41
In the first 72 hours,
there was 7,000 to


208
0:9:5,41 --> 0:9:8,16
10,000 people killed.


209
0:9:8,16 --> 0:9:11,8
Now, we accept that Dow never
owned or operated the plant,


210
0:9:11,8 --> 0:9:14,31
as we are so often told in the
media, but they did acquire


211
0:9:14,31 --> 0:9:16,32
Union Carbide out right.


212
0:9:16,32 --> 0:9:18,9
And they have a very strange
relationship with Union


213
0:9:18,9 --> 0:9:21,215
Carbide, which is one of
not just ownership.


214
0:9:21,215 --> 0:9:24,14
They're effectively
one and the same.


215
0:9:24,14 --> 0:9:27,56
High level executives from one
sit on the board of the other.


216
0:9:27,56 --> 0:9:29,66
MEREDITH ALEXANDER: Dow
Chemical in Bhopal is


217
0:9:29,66 --> 0:9:32,35
responsible for a situation
that is seeing generation


218
0:9:32,35 --> 0:9:35,29
after generation of children
born with the most appalling


219
0:9:35,29 --> 0:9:36,575
birth defects.


220
0:9:36,575 --> 0:9:41,7
The tragic irony of them
sponsoring the Paralympics is


221
0:9:41,7 --> 0:9:42,76
pretty overwhelming,
to be frank.


222
0:9:42,76 --> 0:9:45,8



223
0:9:45,8 --> 0:9:47,41
MALE SPEAKER: Sponsors
like BP--


224
0:9:47,41 --> 0:9:51,57
these large people who've been
associated with all kinds of


225
0:9:51,57 --> 0:9:53,61
forms of pollution--


226
0:9:53,61 --> 0:9:57,625
are actually now wearing the
green jacket of being the eco


227
0:9:57,625 --> 0:10:0,79
heroes rescuing this wonderful
park land that we're going to


228
0:10:0,79 --> 0:10:2,4
be handed back.


229
0:10:2,4 --> 0:10:4,1



230
0:10:4,1 --> 0:10:6,24
MEREDITH ALEXANDER: Rio Tinto
is providing the medals that


231
0:10:6,24 --> 0:10:8,37
actually go around the
athlete's neck.


232
0:10:8,37 --> 0:10:11,77
These are one of the most iconic
images of the Games.


233
0:10:11,77 --> 0:10:15,42
But unfortunately, the metal
comes from mines that are


234
0:10:15,42 --> 0:10:17,44
really environmentally
problematic.


235
0:10:17,44 --> 0:10:20,76
And the local communities are
fighting to get those mines


236
0:10:20,76 --> 0:10:22,91
either closed down or run
more responsibly.


237
0:10:22,91 --> 0:10:25,64



238
0:10:25,64 --> 0:10:26,62
BENNY WENDA: My name
is Benny Wenda.


239
0:10:26,62 --> 0:10:28,1
I am from West Papua.


240
0:10:28,1 --> 0:10:30,95
I am also ex political prisoner
and independent


241
0:10:30,95 --> 0:10:35,42
leader, and now I'm
living in exile.


242
0:10:35,42 --> 0:10:39,11
Rio Tinto is a part of the
problem in West Papua.


243
0:10:39,11 --> 0:10:42,24
Even the human rights
violations, our mountain been


244
0:10:42,24 --> 0:10:44,76
destroyed, our river polluted.


245
0:10:44,76 --> 0:10:50,25
These companies are indirectly
or directly support Indonesia


246
0:10:50,25 --> 0:10:52,83
committed genocide my people.


247
0:10:52,83 --> 0:10:54,87
Rio Tinto need to admit it.


248
0:10:54,87 --> 0:10:56,45
Their gold is the blood
of my people.


249
0:10:56,45 --> 0:11:1,25



250
0:11:1,25 --> 0:13:1,25
