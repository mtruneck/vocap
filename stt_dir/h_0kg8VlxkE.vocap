###16 THOMAS MORTON: Hi, it's Thomas.
###17 We're in Kurdistan in northern Iraq near the Iran border.
###21 We are hanging out with the women fighters of PJAK, Free
###24 Life for Kurdistan Party.
###26 [GUNFIRE]
###29 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###35 THOMAS MORTON: This is northern Iraq, a suburban
###38 paradise of shopping malls, fast food, and the most
###41 advanced movie technology on the planet.
###43 Holy shit.
###44 They are so far ahead of us in dimensional cinema.
###47 It's a pretty far cry from southern Iraq, probably
###50 because it sat out the war that's still ravaging the rest
###52 of the country almost a decade after we started it.
###56 Northern Iraq, also called Iraqi Kurdistan, is a
###59 semi-autonomous state with its own regional government mostly
###62 made up of Iraq's Kurdish ethnic minority.
###65 The Kurds are mountain folk who live in the overlap
###66 between Iraq, Syria, Turkey, and Iran, but don't really
###69 belong to any of them.
###71 The Kurdish goal for the last century or so has been to
###73 carve out a homeland for
###74 themselves, a greater Kurdistan.
###77 Which they've gone about the traditional way by forming
###79 guerrilla armies, blowing up a bunch of crap, and generally
###82 making trouble for the countries whose territory they
###84 consider their own.
###86 So far, the place they've had the most success is Iraq,
###89 though through no small help of the USA.
###92 We're on the corner of Texas Avenue and New Mexico Lane in
###94 the middle of the American village in Kurdistan in
###97 northern Iraq.
###98 Kurdistan is, kind of, a major exception to what's happened
###100 over the last 10 years in Iraq.
###102 It's where the rest of the country has fallen into
###105 bloodshed and divisive fighting, it's blossomed.
###108 They've had a tremendous industry spring up here.
###110 There's developments everywhere.
###112 They're building gated communities that look like
###113 they're somewhere in Southern California, and it's nice.
###119 HIWA OSMAN: We are looking to the West as models for us to
###123 conduct our affairs by.
###125 And what we are seeing from the ruling parties in Baghdad,
###130 they are looking to East and to the immediate
###134 neighborhoods.
###135 You go to any other nation in the region, you will find that
###139 their anti-Americanism runs rife.
###143 The only nation that accepts America fully, despite the few
###149 occasions of betrayal in history,
###152 is the Kurdish nation.
###153 THOMAS MORTON: Throughout their history, the Kurds have
###155 been particularly adept at playing their enemies against
###157 each other.
###158 In the '80s, this meant joining with Iran against
###160 Saddam Hussein which put them at odds with then Iraqi allies
###163 us, meaning America.
###166 Once Saddam got the upper hand, though, and started his
###168 infamous Anfal genocide campaign against them, marked
###171 by mass civilian killings and the indiscriminate use of
###173 chemical weapons, the Kurdish rebels went from terrorists to
###176 freedom fighters in American eyes.
###179 During the first Gulf War, when George Bush spontaneously
###182 called on the Iraqis to rise up against Saddam, the Kurds
###185 took this as a sign of America's full-fledged support
###187 and launched a massive assault on the retreating Iraqi Army,
###190 which failed miserably.
###193 During the subsequent bloodshed and refugee crisis,
###195 US military was forced, largely through bad press, to
###198 make good on their implicit promise and actually give the
###200 Kurds their support.
###202 To this end, they established a no-fly zone at the 36th
###205 parallel to keep the Iraqi Army at bay.
###207 And the rest has been smooth sailing for Iraqi Kurdistan.
###211 I mean, there was a bloody, fractious civil war for a few
###213 years over which rebel group would lead the new country.
###216 But otherwise, Kurdistan has been doing well for itself and
###219 is generally held up as one of the few success stories of
###221 American interventionism.
###223 ROBERT BAER: They absolutely love us.
###225 They give us the oil, they give us anything.
###226 I mean, we've done more for the Kurds
###227 than anybody in history.
###229 We beat their enemy.
###233 THOMAS MORTON: While Iraq is more or less a lock for the
###234 Kurds, Kurds in Turkey, Syria, and Iran, are still fighting
###237 for independence and even basic civil rights using
###241 guerrilla warfare and suicide bombings to their ends.
###245 The US State Department considers most of these groups
###247 terrorist organizations, which is a bit confusing considering
###250 their support for the old Peshmerga guerrillas, who are
###253 now running the show in the entire Kurdish government.
###255 One of these new groups, PJAK, was formed in 2004 right after
###259 the American invasion to specifically target American
###261 enemy Iran.
###263 PJAK has become notorious for their largely female fighting
###266 force and bears a conveniently vague relationship with the
###269 also gender equal PKK, who fight American ally Turkey.
###273 
###279 We're on the road from Erbil to Rania.
###282 Rania is up in the hills.
###284 Today is the eighth or ninth birthday of PJAK, and they're
###287 having a little festival up here that we are going
###290 to take part in.
###291 The PJAK birthday party was being held at a secret
###293 mountain bee farm close to the Iranian border.
###296 It was technically a media event, but since having higher
###298 ups from all the major Kurdish guerrilla groups in one
###301 location made the risk of an Iranian or Turkish rocket
###304 strike especially risky, security precautions were
###307 taken that effectively made us the only media covering it.
###310 So it was kind of like a personal press
###312 conference just for us.
###313 So we're here.
###314 We just, we've been driving in the mountains for a while.
###319 This doesn't look like Iraq.
###320 And I think, actually, we're pretty close to Iran.
###322 
###327 PJAK was designated a terrorist organization by the
###329 Obama administration this year, which made me a little
###332 nervous that running the receiving line here might turn
###334 into a personal Hanoi Jane moment, or moments.
###339 Actually, PJAK occupies a sort of political gray zone where
###342 you're not allowed to give them money, but the government
###344 isn't really trying to stop them from doing
###346 their thing in Iran.
###348 Most likely because the thing they do kind of ties in with
###350 the things we want to do, which is,
###352 namely, fuck with Iran.
###354 The Kurdish Independence Movement
###356 is notoriously factional.
###357 It's your basic "Life of Brian" alphabet soup.
###360 There's the KDP, the PUK, the PKK, the KCK, PJAK, All of
###366 whom have the same ultimate goal but just slightly
###368 different ways of trying to accomplish it.
###371 We tried to get a guy from the PKK to explain the whole
###373 spread for us, although he claimed he wasn't
###375 part of PKK but KCK.
###377 We're not exactly sure there's a difference, though.
###380 RAJ VALAT: Today, approximately 50 million Kurds
###385 living in four parts of Kurdistan.
###387 It's the same problem, but this is in Iran, in
###390 Turkey, or in Syria.
###392 We are one people, and basically, the solution that
###397 we want to see is democratic autonomy for Kurds and
###403 democracy for Turkey, for Iran, for Syria,
###407 for Iraq, as well.
###408 
###417 THOMAS MORTON: PJAK's emergence from the
###418 anti-Turkish PKK seems like a pretty transparent attempt to
###421 snag American support while still
###422 fighting one of its allies.
###424 PKK's leader, though supposedly not PJAK's, even
###427 told the press in its early days that if the CIA wanted to
###430 use PJAK to destabilize Iran, it would be a great idea.
###434 Who supports the Kurds?
###435 Like who are your allies outside of the area?
###438 RAJ VALAT: Our allies are our people.
###442 And our allies are mountains.
###445 That's all.
###447 THOMAS MORTON: Not entirely sold on this reply, we figured
###449 spending a day in the mountains with some of their
###451 female fighters would help answer the question of who
###453 PJAK's real allies are.
