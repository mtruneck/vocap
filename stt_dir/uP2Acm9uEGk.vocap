###6 In that case, I will move on to introduce Colonel Gordon Fullerton who got is bachelor's
###14 and master's degree from Caltech in mechanical engineering, did ROTC and went on to the Air
###23 Force where, well, I guess he has flown, in the course of his career about 135 different
###33 types of airplanes.
###34 16,000 flying hours.
###39 He flew F86 interceptors, B47 Bombers before going to Air Force test pilot school in the
###53 mid `60s.
###54 In '66, he was chosen by the Air Force for the Manned Orbiting Laboratory which was going
###61 to be the Air Force's Space Station.
###67 That program was cancelled in 1969 and the MOL, well, some of the MOL astronauts came
###77 over to NASA and became NASA astronauts.
###80 That was in the heyday of Apollo.
###85 And Gordon was support crew on the last four Apollo missions.
###90 Then went on to be the test pilot on three of the first five approach and landing tests.
###100 If you remember, that is when the Shuttle Enterprise, which was not designed for orbital
###106 flight but was designed to test basically the last 50,000 feet down to the ground, was
###111 dropped from the 747.
###113 Went onto pilot the third Shuttle flight, which was one of the orbital flight tests.
###121 That was the flight which landed in New Mexico.
###124 And then commanded STS-51F which was the first flight of the instrument pointing system.
###138 That was also the flight, I am trying to think, where you lost the engine, which we talked
###147 about.
###147 That was the one flight where we had an engine shutdown.
###151 And we went over that in some detail.
###157 I think they should hear about it from what it seemed like inside the cockpit, now that
###162 they have heard kind of the technical details.
###164 In any case, after leaving the Astronautic Office, Gordon has moved into pilot's heaven
###171 which is Edwards Air Force Base, the Dryden Test Flight Center where he basically spends
###179 all his time.
###180 Well, not all of his time because there is management stuff as well.
###183 Unfortunately, that is the price you pay.
###185 But basically he gets to fly airplanes for a living.
###189 And lots of different kinds, including the career aircraft and the B52 which launches
###195 various test aircraft and a whole bunch of other airplanes.
###204 If you remember in the whole systems engineering approach to things, we talk about the conceived
###211 design, manufacture, test and operation.
###215 So this is basically the final lecture and this is the test and operation of the Space
###222 Shuttle from a pilot's point of view.
###224 So, with that, I will give it to you, Gordon.
###226 Thanks.
###230 I was sitting at your place back in 1958 when I was a grad student at Caltech for a year
###241 before heading off to the Air Force.
###243 Wow, almost 50 years ago.
###248 But the real blessing of my life is to be able to do what I love to do for as long as
###253 I have done it, beyond all reason.
###257 Anyway, I hope to share some of that with you this morning.
###260 This is my first time through this pitch.
###261 Feel free to holler out any questions as we go and we will stumble through it together.
###269 I planned to talk about three different phases of the orbiter test program.
###282 The first were called ALT, the Approach and Landing Test, that consisted of really 13
###290 flights, five captive inert flights where the enterprise was flown on top of the 747
###297 but nobody in the cockpit.
###298 The controls were locked.
###300 That was to clear the envelope for the kind of unlikely looking combination of a 747 with
###307 an orbiter on top.
###309 And then there were three "captive active" flights where we were manned up in the orbiter
###314 with the systems running, the electronics, the hydraulics were active.
###319 The controls were free to move a little bit, not full throw.
###323 And we also determined how high the combination could get.
###328 Because altitude was not 50,000 feet, it was more like 28,000 feet max even with the 747
###338 engines over boosted.
###341 Followed by three "free flights" were we actually pushed the button, munched off the top and
###347 glided to a landing.
###351 The orbital flight test, prior to the Shuttle Program, OFT consisted of four flights.
###356 STS 1 through 4 of varying durations.
###362 STS-1 was planned for just a couple days to get up and get down and have a look at how
###370 things looked after it flew.
###371 STS-2 was supposed to be five days.
###373 They had a fuel cell problem that cut their flight short, unfortunately for the crew.
###379 Then I was on STS-3.
###383 We were scheduled for seven days.
###385 And, because of a raging dust storm at the planned landing site, we got an extra day.
###392 A real blessing.
###393 With no tests to do, we had a free day on orbit.
###398 And ended up with eight days.
###401 STS-4 planned and flew seven days, landing on the fourth of July with President Reagan
###408 out there to watch.
###410 And then we got into operational flights of which there had been a lot.
###415 Something over a hundred.
###418 The last flight to fly, the return to flight was STS-114, but the number system went through
###428 a couple of phases.
###429 There have not been 114 flights.
###432 I don't know how many it has been, but there had been a bunch.
###437 I will talk about three, well, more than three flights, but the ALT flights.
###444 If you have to have a crew patch, that is a major hurdle that you have to overcome.
###452 When you are assigned to a crew, get the patch designed and then get it approved by upper
###457 management.
###462 Part of the OFT, STS-3 in 1982 and finally then an operational flight 51F in 1985.
###476 Prior to any of these flights, I worked into a dream job for really systems engineering,
###483 I guess, and for a pilot.
###486 I had been to test pilot school.
###489 I was intrigued with all the airplanes I flew with a cockpit design and was very aware of
###498 the flaws of cockpit design.
###499 It seems like sometimes engineers lie awake nights trying to make it hard to operate subsystems.
###508 I got in at the beginning of the orbiter crew interface and became, before it was over,
###520 sort of the Czar who was responsible to sign off all the drawings, lots of reviews.
###526 It was a great responsibility because I was immediately and early into subsystem design
###536 because you have to know what the subsystem does to make any intelligent choice of what
###540 the controls and displays should be.
###544 This is a view of, not the Enterprise, but probably, I don't know whether it is a simulator
###553 or the real airplane, they look alike, but one of the orbital capable shuttles.
###560 This is like the little old ladies always say when you're out on display for Armed Forces
###566 Day and look at all the things, how do you remember what they all do?
###572 Well, that really is a challenge to make things straightforward.
###578 And I became painfully aware, especially later on when we had a lot of experiments coming
###587 in, that engineers in their little ivory tower building a system in the lab are so totally,
###596 personally familiar with how their stuff works that it doesn't bother them that the switches
###602 are unlabeled or labeled illogically.
###605 And they bring that all in and want to put it in the orbiter.
###610 And when the crew says wait a minute, I have to remember, before I turn on switch A, switch
###618 C and D have got to be turned on in this order or the whole thing will blow up?
###624 And they say oh, yeah, that is the way it is.
###626 And they know it so well personally.
###629 And, yet, when you are overwhelmed with a whole lot of experiments, I am sure you ran
###634 into it on your flight, that all the stuff that is just totally familiar to the guy that
###643 invented it becomes a challenge when you are faced with a whole lot of them and a limited
###648 amount of time to learn it.
###650 And so, standardization of what the scheme, especially in the software.
###658 While there are a lot of gadgets, in fact, if you count all the switches, gauges, circuit
###668 breakers, upstairs, downstairs and the mid deck, there are about 2,100 total in the orbiter
###674 cockpit.
###677 But the real challenge is what shows up on the screens here.
###683 So the software was a bigger thing in making them all play together.
###690 Here is a higher view in the overhead panel above your head.
###693 And the forward cockpit has a lot of other switches.
###697 An example of what I am talking about, this array of switches right here controls the
###707 reaction control system valving and then the orbital maneuvering system.
###716 Back in Apollo, which I worked on when I first came to Johnson Space Center, I learned, while
###725 lying many hours in the Apollo crew simulator, that that had the worst cockpit every designed
###733 by man.
###736 As an example, it had a helium pressurization system to push the propellants for the reaction
###745 control jets out of the tanks and then the valves that went to the various arrays of
###751 thrusters all around the command module.
###754 And one would think logically, if you have something to turn on the helium, you label
###760 that helium on/off.
###762 And then the manifold, the next branch in the Christmas tree manifold would be system
###771 A versus system B or something like that.
###773 And, in fact, it had names like that.
###775 But they put the switches in a long room and labeled them A through H, right there on the
###783 panel.
###785 No clue as to what you were throwing, so every move you made in the cockpit, some of these
###790 things were critical, required you to either be a metal giant or open a checklist and say
###799 to pressurize system B, I have got to throw B on and then A next and then H last or something
###809 like that.
###810 Obviously, unacceptable.
###814 It became my career and mania to try to improve that.
###821 The first orbiter simulator built was called the OAS, Orbiter Aeroflight Simulator.
###829 It was on a moving based platform like the standard airline simulators you see today.
###838 This is Fred Hayes and I sitting in the cockpit.
###842 This one was built originally to be the Enterprise.
###845 And the Enterprise was OV-101 in the scheme of things, a numbering of orbiters as they
###855 were built.
###857 101 had only the systems it needed to fly the approach and landing test.
###863 The plan was to retrofit it later to make it into orbit capable.
###868 But before the ALT program it had just what you needed and only that to fly in the atmosphere
###878 very short flights.
###879 But this is our first chance to look at what we had and what we were getting into as far
###886 as pilot concerns.
###890 Now, I guess you have had all the subsystems, right?
###892 You were all completely briefed and experts on subsystems by the people that had preceded
###898 me here in the course.
###900 I will give you, though, a quick review here, the avionics system.
###907 The Shuttle is build with inside the outer mole line as the pressure vessel that is roughly
###915 back to the forward bulkhead of the payload bay and is imbedded inside basically aluminum
###924 structure with a thermal protection system applied to the outside.
###930 And most of the avionics are in racks right up here, right in there with you in the cockpit
###938 on the middeck.
###939 The stowage lockers are aft of the racks full of black boxes and lots of wires.
###948 And the other place there were avionics is back here just after the aft bulkhead of the
###953 payload bay.
###954 And there are some areas where they put items like rate gyros and accelerometers.
###961 A lot way back.
###970 From a systems engineering standpoint, Fred Hayes and I were out at Palmdale where they
###978 built all the orbiters.
###980 It seems like the testing always happens after 2:00 AM, tests would run around the clock.
###992 And we were out there way after midnight in the cockpit participating in the first time
###999 they were going to close the loop between the rate gyros and the flight control system
###1004 which is contained back up here in the nose and the general purpose computers.
###1011 The whole orbiter was suspended on some big airfield bag so it had compliance to move.
###1018 And the hydraulic system was on powered by a facility hydraulic source.
###1025 The elevons were powered and the rudder speed brake was powered and the process let us down
###1033 for the very first time that we were going to close the loop between the software up
###1040 here and the rate gyros particularly and accelerometers mounted in the back.
###1047 And it was a milestone.
###1049 And we had people stationed around the back to see if anything spit out hydraulic fluid
###1056 or whatever.
###1059 Anyway, we went up to the glass shield and pushed the button to go into CSS, Control
###1064 Stick Steering, which hooked the stick up now to the flight control system.
###1071 I will never forget.
###1075 We pushed the button and a rumble started.
###1081 And the rumble built very rapidly to a violent rumble.
###1084 I mean we were being bounced around the cockpit.
###1087 This is 150,000 pounds of airplane dancing on these rubber bags.
###1095 And it didn't take us long to say this doesn't feel good.
###1099 We pulled the button that downloads back to direct control so there is no feedback.
###1105 And the upshot of it was that these rate gyros are mounted on this flexible bulkhead.
###1110 And that had been taken into account properly.
###1115 And so there was a structural resonance that was just diversion.
###1121 In spite of all the Grounds tests down at Downy and the Iron Bird mockups and everything,
###1129 when we put it in the real airplane it tried to jump off the supports.
###1138 And Fred and I were in the cockpit, our eyes were big, and we called the control room which
###1146 were people back in an adjacent room.
###1148 It seems like most spacecraft tests, traditionally, are done with engineers all locked up in windowless
###1154 room, no view of the real hardware.
###1156 Down at the Cape they are miles away when the spacecraft is either out on the pad or
###1163 in the main checkout building.
###1166 And so they said no, the procedure says this is OK and we want you to re-engage.
###1174 We tried one more time.
###1177 And this time the guy stationed in back that were watching said this doesn't look good.
###1182 They started hollering on the loop so we pitched it off.
###1186 And we went into a raging argument.
###1190 We need to complete this test, the engineers were saying.
###1193 And we were saying we don't want to break something.
###1196 And they got people out of bed down in California, controls engineers.
###1201 And so, it was a memorable night.
###1207 The resolution was finally a redesign of the mounting area back there and reanalysis of
###1216 the vibrational modes of the aft bulkhead sorted all out.
###1221 Here is what we had for a crew interface.
###1231 You saw in the earlier picture, upfront three CRTs, monochrome, green, it was either green
###1238 or nothing on the screen, and we had two keyboards, three CRTs.
###1245 There was always this little concern, when you are punching on a keyboard, you want to
###1249 be sure it is selected to the CRT you think you are doing something on.
###1255 Another marginal design, but that is what we ended up with.
###1258 You notice we have a hexadecimal keyboard here.
###1262 We have some strange keys called item and electric and ops which had to do with this
###1273 truly unique way you cause things to happen through software.
###1277 And lots of things were critical through software.
###1281 And then this rather dim green screen.
###1284 This was way before the days, I guess, Bill Gates was still here at MIT or maybe even
###1290 hadn't registered yet.
###1292 I don't know.
###1292 It was way before Windows 1.0.
###1296 And so it seems almost comical now when you compare it to even modern airliner crew interface
###1305 with glass cockpits, but we were breaking new ground here.
###1311 And it, even at the time, seemed antiquated because that is all they were willing to embrace
###1318 in the way of computer control and design.
###1323 And it was unique.
###1324 And it causes lots of headaches and delays.
###1333 The big thing about the orbiter with its data process system, the decision was made that
###1343 everything is going to be done with these all powerful general purpose computers in
###1349 which there were five in an array that worked together.
###1353 Flight control, system management, navigation, inertial subsystem control of everything.
###1361 And so, the result was the software loads, as they were built, had lots of flaws when
###1370 they came down, yet we couldn't fix them.
###1374 We had cases as dumb as a display that showed the Freon loop A pump on.
###1384 And, when it got through the entire software belt, it was backwards.
###1389 It would say off when it was really on.
###1392 Seems like a simple fix, right?
###1394 Go back to the programmer and rewrite the code.
###1400 But we couldn't do it.
###1401 We had to live with it for a long period of time through training until another whole
###1405 load was built.
###1407 Because the load that would fix this dumb little bi-level mistake was also the one that
###1415 steered you during ascent.
###1418 So everything was frozen and there was great fear of changing anything that would ricochet
###1422 through to something truly critical.
###1425 And so, even when we got to STS-3, we flew with a book about this thick of program notes
###1437 that told you, line after line, what was wrong, what was backwards, what was a trap.
###1446 And really a big challenge to the crew to embrace and live with because there just wasn't
###1452 time in the program to build another load, check it out through all the different labs
###1459 that had to certify it.
###1466 That is load for modular software where you can change something here and be assured you
###1472 are not bollixing up something else in the same machine.
###1480 OMS, RCS.
###1481 These are the two pods.
###1483 On either side of the vertical tail are a couple big OMS, propellant tanks, oxidizer
###1490 and fuel hypergolic.
###1491 We didn't need any ignition system.
###1493 As soon as these came together in a thruster you had thrust.
###1499 And there were, I think, 44 main thrusters.
###1504 Here are four yaw jets firing out to the side.
###1508 S&B pitch jets.
###1511 The same thing repeated on the other side.
###1513 And up in the nose are the forward RCS.
###1516 They had jets that fired up and out to the side and down.
###1520 And I mentioned the controls in the cockpit, which we did.
###1526 One of my great successes was getting the orbiter panels to be arranged in a plumbing
###1536 layout so that you could see what you were pressurizing when you turned on the helium
###1540 for a given let and that sort of thing.
###1544 Helium tanks are what pressurized in a really cleaver system of OH control.
###1553 That is when you are in zero G and you have propellant floating around randomly.
###1560 And you turn on the helium to push it toward the outlet.
###1564 If the outlet is uncovered, the helium is going to squirt right out.
###1570 But they had an elaborate system of surface tension kind of baffles that kept and trapped
###1577 fuel near the outlet of the tank so that when the thrust came on and all the propellant
###1584 went down where it should, it sort of recharged this chamber at the bottom of the tanks to
###1592 keep it flowing smoothly and not lose all the pressurization.
###1598 I remember my first impression of what reaction control jets would be like was based on science
###1613 fiction movies where you would see the spacecraft out there and there were little squirts of
###1620 jets that nudge you around.
###1622 And we went out to the Ground test facility at White Sands on a fieldtrip out there where
###1629 they actually had the forward RCS setup, and they were going to do real firings of the
###1636 main jets out there.
###1639 And we were probably a couple hundred feet away from the test setup.
###1644 We were out there waiting for this sequence of jet firing to start on a test.
###1653 And the first firing of one of the main jets, which are right up around 900 pounds thrust,
###1661 was just this short pulse.
###1662 And everybody went about three feet off the ground.
###1666 I mean it was like you fired a howitzer.
###1669 It was just stunning.
###1671 Wham, wham, and it just blew you away.
###1676 And the realization of we are going to be in the cockpit here, and these things are
###1679 firing right outside the windshield.
###1683 They did.
###1684 In space, the ignition transient ricochets through the structure.
###1689 You can hear this kind of bombing effect.
###1692 But once they are on, if it is a long duration firing, it is silent.
###1698 And the same way visually, you can see a flash when the fuel is led a little bit in front
###1705 of the oxidizer to make sure you don't overheat something.
###1708 And so, there is incomplete combustion at the ignition.
###1711 You can see a flash go out there.
###1712 But what is on during an OMS burn, for instance, when these OMS engines are firing and you
###1718 are looking back at the aft, you see the flash and they are on and they are pushing and you
###1722 can feel it.
###1723 But otherwise invisible is the way I remember.
###1728 On the other hand, there are vernier jets, little guys.
###1731 I don't know if they are shown here.
###1733 But there are little 25 pound thrusters or something used 98% of the time on orbit.
###1740 You really are doing that kind of thing with the vernier jets.
###1745 And you cannot hear those or see anything when they are going off.
###1749 In fact, we got everybody quiet and kind of held onto the walls just trying to see if
###1756 we could barely detect when a vernier jet fired physically in a cockpit.
###1762 Interesting.
###1769 The orbiter is one giant heat transfer machine.
###1776 Lots of calories of heat energy pumped around from one end to the other.
###1785 And so, there are water loops within the cabin that transfer the heat to Freon loops.
###1793 The fluid is pumped through the radiators to reject heat.
###1800 In spite of all these heat rejection systems then there are heaters everywhere, whole banks
###1808 of heaters to keep stuff from freezing.
###1810 Then for the landing and takeoff phases, there are flash evaporators that flash water and/or
###1819 ammonia.
###1823 When you are down in the atmosphere you use ammonia to cool the loops.
###1832 And, of course, the payload bay doors are closed.
###1835 And it turns out STS-3, a major test of it was test all these loops and how the structure
###1844 responded to long durations of given attitudes with the sun shining on one side and cold
###1851 space on the other side and how the structure would distort or hopefully not distort and
###1858 how all that system would work.
###1860 As it turned out, if you like lots of redundancy, this is probably the weak point I thought
###1867 in the whole orbiter design, we've got three engines.
###1872 We proved that you can get there with only two.
###1876 But the Freon loops, there were two redundant through the radiators.
###1882 And if one Freon loop pumped quick you are in a severe emergency.
###1888 That means stop everything and power down severely.
###1891 Turn off all the computers except one, get in a proper attitude and go into a panic reconfiguration
###1904 to come back and land.
###1905 Originally, the design had three Freon loops.
###1909 It could use one and go on with no concern.
###1916 But, as it turned out, the heat loads were so high and the weight criticality determined
###1927 that all we had electrical power to run were two loops.
###1933 And so we ended up with a single Freon loop which fortunately, as far as I know, never
###1939 failed.
###1940 But if it had it would have been a crash deorbit landing under severely powered down conditions.
###1950 While it is kind of mundane and people don't think about it as a primary system, the thermal
###1958 control really was critical.
###1962 Payload bay doors, this is a busy chart but indicates these are really complicated.
###1970 60 feet long and something like 120 little motor driven latches to latch them closed.
###1983 And you don't just go chunk close like the bomb bay on a B52 and it is closed.
###1990 To close the payload bay doors you get them close and then the latches along the bulked,
###1997 all in a zipper fashion, have to sequentially close.
###2000 And then you go down the center section to latch the two left and right doors together.
###2009 All software controlled.
###2013 And there was a lot of concern that we address on STS-3 particularly about whether this is
###2019 all going to work.
###2021 If you have been floating around with these pointed to dark space, would they distort
###2027 to where the zipper scheme would work?
###2030 We worried about it enough that part of our emergency training, contingency training,
###2040 a lot of time was spent underwater in the neutral buoyancy tank looking at a system
###2047 going out EVA with a series of come-alongs, you know, the kind of things you use to pull
###2058 the motor out a car, that kind of thing, that we could go down there and hookup and latch
###2068 the doors shut to actually manually get them shut and then latch them shut with these.
###2077 Fortunately, that has never been used.
###2079 And this complex system has worked good, but it was scary the first time we flew it on
###2086 STS-3.
###2087 That was a big concern.
###2090 What I have got here is hydraulic system.
###2098 Hydraulics are hydrazine powered turbines that run at some ridiculous RPM, like 200,000
###2108 RPM to drive hydraulic pumps back here in the backend.
###2112 And then they are crucial during launch because they have got to hold the elevons in position.
###2119 But they also have to provide the muscle to gimbal the main engines and keep you steering
###2128 straight during launch.
###2131 During entry they are what you use to fly when you get into a dynamic pressure situation.
###2137 Control the rudder speed brake and the body flap.
###2140 The body flap is a big surface that sticks out underneath the main engine bells and is
###2148 a slow moving trem device.
###2150 The body flat is always moved.
###2152 You go through this mach 25 to mach zero envelope.
###2159 And the trem conditions necessary with these big elevons varies a lot.
###2167 So, to desaturate the elevons and keep them basically faired with the wing, the body flap
###2174 is your trim device.
###2176 And it is like this row of tables long and this wide.
###2181 I remember asking to see the motor.
###2185 It is driven by a whole lot of mechanical advantage by a hydraulic motor.
###2191 A guy took me around.
###2194 I couldn't find the actuator for the body flap.
###2196 He showed me.
###2197 The motor was this big around and this long, a little hydraulic motor.
###2201 So you can do anything with mechanical advantage.
###2205 But it didn't have to move very fast.
###2207 Finally, on the system pictures here, the RMS.
###2214 Hopefully, you have heard about this.
###2216 It was built by Spara up in Canada.
###2219 The Canadians main contribution to the orbiter program.
###2223 A pretty magical device.
###2225 It can go on either side, but for our flights mounted on the left-hand side or the right
###2233 if you're looking out the back windows at it.
###2236 And it had joints logically called the shoulder joint, elbow, wrist joint.
###2245 All electric motor driven.
###2249 But the interesting thing was a control.
###2252 You had hand controllers mounted in the aft part on the right console in the back where
###2259 you looked out.
###2260 And you could work in the mode where you actually drive in the end left, right, up, down, in,
###2266 out without regard to whatever joint was done.
###2270 That is all resolved by the software.
###2272 And worked well.
###2274 The end effector was a cleaver kind of a hallow cylindrical device.
###2280 It would rotate inside and three cables that would be curved around the periphery inside
###2292 this cavity when activated.
###2295 I put this over a post on whatever you wanted to grab onto with a knob on the end.
###2302 You go over the post and then rotate the inner barrel and the cables would wrap up and grab
###2307 onto the post.
###2308 And then they would retract in to rigidize.
###2311 And that was the grabber on the RMS.
###2314 And we flew this on STS-3.
###2318 I will show you later.
###2319 Anyway, that is the subsystem review.
###2325 Let me show you how things went during approach and landing tests.
###2331 Now, let's see.
###2332 I have never figured out how to imbed video and PowerPoint so I am going to be doing it
###2341 manually.
###2341 Any questions while we are waiting on this to come up?
###2361 Well, this is the desert around where I live and a Gila monster and a Joshua tree to set
###2368 the scene.
###2369 And here you have OV-101.
###2373 The numbering system, as it turned out, is kind of interesting.
###2378 They built OV-99 as the structural test article.
###2382 It was strictly built to be in the lab and do all the structural testing on it.
###2389 101 then was the first orbiter build, the Enterprise, being hauled from Palmdale across
###2398 the backgrounds and the desert roads to get over to Edwards in these scenes.
###2403 And 101 was the ALT airplane.
###2406 You can see kind of phony looking RCS.
###2410 It has, as I mentioned, only the systems that you needed to fly atmospheric flight.
###2418 This was a big thing getting it across the country.
###2423 It had a Pitot boom on it.
###2426 It has just simulated thermal protection.
###2430 Styrofoam painted to look kind of like they thought the space vehicles would look but
###2437 wasn't real.
###2438 It was put in the mating and docking device which is at NASA Dryden where I work now.
###2446 Hoisted it up.
###2446 And then the 747 and 905, the first Shuttle carrier aircraft, was pulled under and they
###2454 mated them up.
###2455 I remember flying out to Edwards and seeing this unlikely combination.
###2460 And the first time I saw the two together, I thought they cannot be serious.
###2466 But then I realized I was going to be in it.
###2470 There were 13 total flights.
###2474 This is a taxi test.
###2477 When you have an aerodynamic test you can sneak up, and so you do baby steps.
###2481 This was just a high speed down the runway to see if it would rotate and if anything
###2486 would shake alarmingly.
###2489 And that will look good.
###2494 Preparations proceeded for the first of the captive inert flights.
###2499 This is Fitz Fulton and Tom McMurtry, both real good friends, and they were the crew
###2505 on the 747 for this first milestone flight.
###2509 A lot of people were out watching and wondering if it would fly, which it did very well.
###2515 And off it went.
###2517 You notice a longer front attached structure there.
###2523 And the orbiter is purposely on there at angle of attack to produce lift.
###2532 I flew a 747 for ferry flights now and to haul orbiters back to the Cape when they land
###2539 at Edwards, as the last one did.
###2542 And the nose, that front bipod is much shorter so that the orbiter is down for less drag
###2550 for the combination.
###2553 But this setup here was so that we could get the orbiter off the top and not the tail.
###2564 There is a rumble.
###2564 The crew noticed a shaking.
###2566 It is still the case when you fly.
###2569 These vertical fins were added onto the horizontal stabs to increase directional stability because
###2575 the orbiter blanks a lot of flow over the normal vertical.
###2578 In fact, they overdid it a little bit.
###2581 There is too much structural stability which has resulted in the weird situation.
###2588 Your cross-wind limit, when you have an orbiter onboard, is greater than when it is not because
###2599 you have so much directional stability and a crosswind.
###2601 There is a strong weathervaning and you run out of normal rudder without an orbiter, so
###2606 you are good only to 15 knots crosswind with the orbiter on.
###2611 The limit is 20 knots.
###2613 And it is a good limit.
###2615 I have flown them both ways in cross winds.
###2617 And, indeed, at those numbers you run out of rudder as you land and are rolling out.
###2622 The strong weathervane intensity is leading you out this side of the runway.
###2629 Anyway, that looked good.
###2630 And so I came back and we had a big post-flight party.
###2635 ALT was great for parties.
###2636 We had 13 post-flight parties.
###2639 And, at the same time we were doing the ALT flights, we are developing a Shuttle training
###2651 aircraft.
###2652 This is Gulfstream II with big side force generators on the belly.
###2659 That is an airborne simulator.
###2661 The left seat is set up with orbiter instruments.
###2665 And the right seat was the standard gulfstream cockpit that had flown thousands of dives
###2674 at the ground in the SGA preparing for the whole idea of first time for sure unpowered
###2687 landing that you have to do right the first time.
###2689 And back in the simulator here for lots more runs.
###2698 And it was a great time because everything was brand new, very interesting.
###2705 This is a camera and an actual model.
###2708 This is before the days of computer generated video.
###2713 It flew the little camera down to landing.
###2716 And we learned a lot about [NOISE OBSCURES]
###2719 characteristics.
###2721 One that we really wondered about, when you made a lateral input to roll the orbiter in
###2730 the simulator, it would bang you.
###2732 It was this lateral lurch, we call it.
###2737 It would jolt you sideways.
###2738 And we thought this cannot be real.
###2740 It doesn't make any sense.
###2741 No airplane we ever flew does that.
###2743 We squawked it.
###2745 They came back and said the equations are all worked out so we live with it and thought
###2751 it was just an artifact that snuck in there and didn't worry about it.
###2757 Now, the captive-active started where we actually got in and cranked things up.
###2770 On the second flight, I was chasing in a T-38.
###2774 And Engle and Truly were in the cockpit.
###2775 And I noticed a shiny look on the side.
###2782 That big X on the CRT is what happens when the computer that is driving that CRT quits.
###2788 That is sort of the panic symbol when the X shows up.
###2794 Anyway, I noticed a leak, as it turned out to be.
###2798 We had that severe hydrazine leak.
###2800 Hydrazine is bad stuff to have leaking.
###2803 And one of the APU supply tanks let go.
###2809 Plus, they had an over temp.
###2813 We found things that were wrong that made these captive flights worthwhile.
###2819 If we had just gone and launched off on the first one, it could have been more exciting
###2826 than it needed to be.
###2830 We had five of those.
###2831 And Fred Hayes and I got the odd numbered flights, one, three and five.
###2836 Five more post-flight parties.
###2837 And then we decided we were ready to go.
###2844 Well, this is the last of the captive-active flights.
###2847 The scheme by which we plan to get off of here and not take off the tail of the 747
###2854 was that the 747 would go as high as it could go.
###2857 It could get up to around 27,000 feet with engines over-boosted.
###2863 Pratt & Whitney said you could go this long with extra power.
###2867 And then nose over and speed up to 240 knots.
###2872 It was climbing maybe to 190, 200 knots.
###2877 With a little downhill push, we got up to 240.
###2880 At 240 the SEA pilots would go to idle power and air brakes up to put drag on the carrier.
###2891 At that condition of 240 knots and the angle of attack of the orbiter, it was actually
###2899 lifting more than its own weight.
###2902 So the result is we really dropped the carrier, as it turns out.
###2907 There is three-quarters of a G difference between the two.
###2911 And so, we got a lot of use.
###2913 For some reason Fred's left shoulder, he is in the left seat and he mashed the separation
###2919 button after Fitz on the carrier aircraft hollered "carrier ready," that is they were
###2925 back at idle with the speed brakes up, pushed the go button and bang, all seven explosive
###2935 bolts would blow.
###2938 Control Room was in Houston, strange enough.
###2940 We are talking to people back in the old JSC Control Room when we are out at Edwards flying
###2947 these flights.
###2948 It was just like they were there.
###2949 And we were coming up on a condition.
###2953 And this was in August of '77.
###2957 All the ALT flights happened in 1977.
###2960 You notice there is a tail cone on here.
###2966 The tail cone was flown on the first three flights.
###2969 That makes a big difference.
###2972 It smoothes the flow s that the buffet on the tail, the carrier aircraft was less, and
###2979 it just about doubled the L/D of the orbiter.
###2983 We are going to arm.
###2991 And we had two chases, one off to the right and in trail separation.
###3004 Just like the engineer said and the load cells that we had on there, testing exactly which
###3012 was the thing tugging before we did it, said we could do straight up.
###3016 This is slow motion.
###3018 Nothing is leaking.
###3019 The vortex is out at the wing tips causing condensation and away we went.
###3027 And simultaneous with this bang that shutters through the airplane with all these explosive
###3032 volts a big X on the CRT in front of me.
###3039 We had cue cards and we had practiced this.
###3044 My job, while Fred flew, he actually got a vertical clear from this chase pilot and then
###3053 rolled into a bank and a lateral clear from the guy that was chasing from behind and knew
###3058 that it was OK to push over.
###3060 Because we are only now at 200 knots and we wanted to get to 300.
###3064 And it took a considerable pushover to get up to speed.
###3069 Meanwhile, I am pulling circuit breakers on rate gyros and turning off accelerometers
###3074 at our preplanned procedure to accommodate flaws in the redundancy management.
###3085 When you lose one computer you also take out part of the sensors in the flight control
###3091 system.
###3091 And, to be sure that a subsequent failure wouldn't put you in worse shape, it took about
###3096 a minute's worth of manual reconfiguration on my part.
###3099 And I kind of missed the whole first part of the flight.
###3102 When I turned around I realized hey, this thing is flying good, it is smooth and is
###3106 on speed.
###3107 And Fred was flying.
###3109 We flew a rectangular pattern out of a downwind leg here as we nosed over.
###3115 And I got my chance to roll into a left 90 degree turn and fly base leg.
###3121 And, as I put the stick over to roll, we got this big lateral arch just like the simulator
###3127 said.
###3130 It just stunned me.
###3131 Son of a gun, they were right after all.
###3133 It was just the nature of something flying at high alpha and rotating about a stability
###3141 axis and the cockpit gets slid sideways.
###3143 It has big elevons so it flies like a fighter.
###3146 It really does.
###3147 And you are doing it all with a little stick that doesn't move much.
###3151 Anyway, we came down final at 290, I think it was, flared out.
###3158 My job was to put the gear down, a critical function.
###3160 And we are landing on lakebed 1-7 on the dry lake at Edwards which is something like ten
###3170 miles long, so we have pretty good margins there.
###3174 And Fred took the airplane back from ALT and I got to fly base leg.
###3180 But we touched down at about 185, I think it was, nice and smooth.
###3186 It was beautiful.
###3187 The speed brake comes out to help cushion the de-rotation, nose gear down and he raised
###3196 a little dust as he rolled to a stop.
###3198 So it was a good day.
###3200 Now, we had a really good post-flight party after this one.
###3208 And see the rudder speed brake flared there and the elevons fold up.
###3219 And so, now Fred truly did it again.
###3223 A couple weeks later or thereabouts they got their turn and they did much the same flight,
###3236 repeated it.
###3237 Oh, one thing.
###3240 You see the Pitot boom out there.
###3243 The Pitot boom is strictly on the Enterprise, put out there to get good air data out in
###3247 front of this big blivit of an airplane which is hard to get good measurements.
###3254 Let me get the next one going here, if I can figure out how to get out of this.
###3270 The excitement came later.
###3272 On STS-1, I looked out there when were on final, I had to look out and look at the Pitot
###3289 boom, and it is going through an arch of about three feet.
###3294 It was built with the perfect resonance of everything else with the airplane, and it
###3299 was just a blur out there going back and forth.
###3302 And I really thought it was going to break off.
###3304 Was that your only Pitot source or did you have the normal ones [OVERLAPPING VOICES]?
###3313 Good question.
###3315 Somehow we had at least inertially derived ones.
###3318 Everything looked good.
###3320 And, actually, it still put out good airspeed, even though it was a blur.
###3324 And I think the beta averaged out.
###3326 Anyway, it wasn't a problem we noticed other than visually it looked like it was going
###3335 to break off.
###3336 They changed and stiffened it up so it wasn't a problem on subsequent flights.
###3340 Now, you can see here we are at free flight four now which was the other crew's turn.
###3347 The tail cone is off and our final pressure glide slope with the tail cone on was 11 degrees.
###3359 With tail cone off it was 23 degrees, halves your L/D.
###3365 So you really are in a steep dive.
###3371 Normal ILS into Logan out here would be 2.5 degrees so you are coming down gangbusters.
###3380 And it is even worse in ALT than it was in the orbital missions which were coming down
###3387 with the same configuration but much heavier.
###3390 Heavier you've got more gravity working for you and you can fly shallower.
###3393 It doesn't seem to figure, but that is the way it is.
###3396 So 19 degrees is a normal return from orbit.
###3401 Final pressure glide slope we were up in the 20s.
###3404 Kind of catching up a little.
###3411 One of our jobs on the flight preceding this was to try the braking.
###3417 We just let it roll out on the first couple flights.
###3420 They wanted to do brake tests.
###3422 And Fred jumped on the brakes after we touched down and another resonance problem, interaction
###3428 between the structure and the anti-skid, and I thought it was going to break the airplane.
###3439 It was just violent shuttering, shaking, everything rattling in the cockpit.
###3444 And I hollered to Fred, get off the brakes, we are going to brake something.
###3447 He said no, the card says we have got to do max braking.
###3450 I was pleading with him to get off the brakes, which he did.
###3453 Easy fix.
###3454 When they flew the next flight here they did hard braking, and it was smooth.
###3460 They went in to change the resister and the feedback electrons, and that did it.
###3467 I mean it was instant fix.
###3470 So there still is reason to do flight tests because surprises happen.
###3482 Now free flight five, it turns out there was a little brake here.
###3489 We are back at Houston and Prince Charles, who wasn't married yet at that time, came
###3497 by on a visit.
###3499 And we gave him a ride in the simulator.
###3504 He had some flying time.
###3506 And he got into a horrendous PIO.
###3508 I mean he was out of control and crashed in the simulator.
###3513 And felt bad.
###3514 And we said that is because you're not used to the stick and everything.
###3517 And that was his tour.
###3518 Now, for this flight, he was actually out along the runway.
###3523 They had him out there so he could watch.
###3526 The objective here was to land on the concrete runway, put it right on the line, there is
###3531 a white line 5,000 feet down, and Fred was really working at it, putting in a lot of
###3537 inputs.
###3537 Look at the elevons going there.
###3539 You see them?
###3542 And he is making roll commands.
###3546 And so we logged a couple landings.
###3556 And down and rolled to a stop.
###3564 Afterwards, we called out and he came up to say hello.
###3566 He said oh, you made me feel good.
###3568 You guys did as bad as I did.
###3571 There he is right there with his binoculars.
###3575 Well, that scared everybody to death.
###3578 It looked worse from outside than it did in the cockpit.
###3580 And the flight control flaw that we found, though, was serious.
###3585 You've got elevons that do both pitch and roll.
###3590 So, in the software, when you are asking for both pitch and roll at the same time, it has
###3594 got to decide which one do I move?
###3598 This is just a supposition of what would come.
###3608 The software had to give priority.
###3610 And they decided to give priority to pitch.
###3613 And roll was taken second priority when you had to limit the commands to the elevons to
###3622 within the capability of the hydraulic system.
###3627 The result was a lag in roll response when you are working pitch hard.
###3632 And the lag was up around two-tenths to three-tenths of a second.
###3636 You may be aware if you studied flight control systems.
###3640 Any kind of system that has a quarter second delay between input and response is asking
###3650 for a PIO, Pilot Induced Oscillation.
###3655 And we had a big time in roll.
###3657 Fred was clanking back and forth to stop and roll trying to level the wings out there that
###3661 first skip.
###3662 I heard the controller banging over there.
###3666 And I suggested if you get off maybe it will damp.
###3670 We're doing this and, sure enough, that is what he did.
###3675 He stopped the inputs, the airplane damped right away and then it went OK.
###3681 But it was something we had to fix, obviously.
###3690 Here is a picture just a micro-second after liftoff on one of the last two.
###3700 Well, there was a decision with a lot of debate about do we go back and fix the flight control
###3706 and fly some more ALT?
###3708 But this is a huge production and it was costing time and we weren't getting into orbit.
###3712 A decision was made now we will do it in simulators and in-flight simulators and fix the problem,
###3718 but press on.
###3719 That was the end of ALT, at the end of which, when you do flight tests, you talk about opening
###3724 the envelope of an airplane.
###3725 Well, the envelope of the Space Shuttle is 400 nautical miles altitude and mach 25.
###3732 And in ALT we got the four miles and 0.3 mach.
###3736 It is really down in the lower left corner, but worth doing.
###3743 Test results.
###3745 I mentioned as we went we had that APU fuel leak.
###3748 Fixed it.
###3749 Didn't come back.
###3752 The buffet lifter drag was right on what we expected, no surprises there.
###3757 Handling qualities were good, even with the lurch.
###3760 It was not a problem.
###3763 I mentioned the Pitot boom, the anti-skid.
###3766 SCA did the job, although it struggled to get up.
###3771 With the tail coming off, it could only get to about 18,000 feet.
###3775 So this was not a good program to build up your flying time.
###3780 It was about a total, in three flights, of about 12 minutes of flying time.
###3789 And the biggie I mentioned was the handling qualities and the PIO tendency that we fixed
###3798 with lots of studies later and changes in the way the control equations were written.
###3805 And, as a final thing, they did some more flights with the nose lowered down and determine
###3810 what the ferry flight performance of the combination is.
###3814 I, later after flying in space, checked out on the 747 and still fly it on the ferry flights.
###3821 And it does the job.
###3824 It burns lots of gas.
###3826 I figured out that the combination across the country, the mileage is about 300 feet
###3836 per gallon, so a football field per gallon of fuel.
###3840 40,000 pounds an hour is the field flow.
###3844 It goes about 1.5 times its own length when we get on the gas, but it gets there.
###3855 I don't have to buy the fuel.
###3857 A lot of people said wasn't this scary, ALT?
###3860 Actually, from a risk standpoint, we had ejection seats.
###3865 If anything had gone wrong, anywhere along the line, we could have pulled the handle
###3871 and jumped out.
###3873 The scariest part of it was when we got in, and during the captive flights, we would just
###3879 walk up a stairway and crawl through the hatch.
###3881 And the same way getting out.
###3883 But after the captive active flights, we would land still on the orbiter.
###3892 And they had this cherry picker to get us out.
###3896 Now, the situation here is it's a round hatch hedged at the bottom.
###3900 They only wanted on person at a time on the end of this thing.
###3907 You open a round hatch and then they bring this up, the guy on the ground.
###3913 And he doesn't want to get too close and ding so he leaves about this much of a gap from
###3919 this round hatch which is 60 feet above the ground that you have got to crawl out on your
###3924 knees, then stand up and then make the leap across the thing onto this wobbly cage up
###3931 there.
###3932 That is how our captive actives went.
###3937 Where you wearing flight suits for all these tests?
###3944 Yeah, we were wearing flight suits and helmets like you would in a 518 or any fighter.
###3952 Not pressure suits.
###3953 We didn't have a severe cabin pressure risk at 25,000 feet.
###3962 Let me get into the full screen mode here.
###3968 I put in some thoughts about what is different when you test an aircraft versus a spacecraft.
###3975 With an airplane you can do little baby steps, incremental tests.
###3978 You can do static runs of the propulsion up to the full power in the airplane itself.
###3984 Then you taxi it slow and then faster and faster down the runway.
###3988 You can rotate the nose a little bit.
###3991 The first flight you will fly slow and leave the gear down and then land it soon and check
###3996 everything.
###3997 And you could hold off for a perfect day to do it.
###4000 And then you go faster and faster to expand the envelope.
###4004 If anything goes wrong you can peel off and get back on the ground quick.
###4010 And, as I mentioned, you can always pull the handle and bail out if things go really bad.
###4015 When you have a spacecraft it is all or nothing.
###4021 You have got to use the propulsion at its full power.
###4025 All the critical systems and subsystems have got to work.
###4031 You cannot make a quick abort.
###4034 Long delays like days are sometimes required to get back to the conditions where you can
###4039 make an appropriate landing.
###4041 And the weather could turn sour at the time.
###4047 When you are going to flight test the spacecraft you have got to have a lot of redundancy in
###4054 the design to allow for the bad day that has to carry it through in a considerable amount
###4061 of time.
###4061 You necessarily have got to test everything to the limit, wind tunnels, CVD, thermal vacuum
###4070 because the environment is lots more stressful.
###4074 You have got to have a lot of instrumentation so that you can tell what did go wrong or
###4079 be sure that everything went right.
###4080 You are talking about an army of controllers in a control room to pull it off with a complex
###4088 system like the Shuttle.
###4090 And lots of simulation to get everybody trained.
###4094 A biggie is to verify the software.
###4096 I mentioned the software is guaranteed to be wrong on the first release and several
###4102 subsequent.
###4102 It is just the nature of building software.
###4107 And so getting that checked out is a major one.
###4112 Procedures.
###4113 When we flew the orbital flight, the stack of checklists just laid on top of each other
###4124 was about this high, for 51F, and it weighed 210 pounds.
###4129 It was called the Flight Data File.
###4135 And then lots of time and expense getting everybody really ready to go.
###4143 And being sure that when you're going into an unknown part of the envelope that the margins
###4150 on the flight control are adequate.
###4152 So the surprises and the aeroderivatives that hit you can be accommodating.
###4157 I have rambled on a long time here.
###4162 We can take the five-minute break, I can answer questions, however you want to do it.
###4167 Maybe it's time for a stretch.
###4168 Let's do a two-minute break.
###4172 These people are tough.
###4176 All right.
###4178 Break is over.
###4180 The next assignment for me was being put on an orbital flight test, and specifically STS-3.
###4198 A two man crew, Jack Lousma, a Marine, and myself from the Air Force, we were in pressure
###4211 suits, you will notice there, and on ejection seats in the Columbia.
###4216 This is OV-102.
###4219 101 was the Enterprise.
###4222 102 was the Columbia.
###4224 And our countdown went smoothly.
###4228 This was in March of '82.
###4230 And this is a signature moment in your life when the SRBs light.
###4237 I mean it looks smooth and nice as we are flying through a cloud here on launch, logging
###4246 weather time I might add, but it is rough and noisy and rattley.
###4257 And the acceleration is right away, and it builds up to 3Gs.
###4263 When the main engines are throttled back, the whole 3Gs.
###4266 And so, it is no doubt you are on your way somewhere really fast wherever the solids
###4270 want to go.
###4274 Everything worked good right up to MECO.
###4277 And the external tank, as you saw, drifted away.
###4280 And then here come the first order of business, opening the payload bay doors so we can start
###4288 rejecting heat with the radiators that are mounted on the inside.
###4293 We are tailed down.
###4295 And as you watch here, we are going right over Los Angeles at the time.
###4301 This is just north of LA.
###4303 You can see LA.
###4307 Sorry, this is Santa Monica, LAX and Palos Verdes right there.
###4322 Anyway, the first thing we had to do is get out of Theodolite, that is a sighting device
###4329 that surveyors use, and take a daunting number of readings on little targets that were pasted
###4339 around inside the payload bay and on the doors to measure where they were.
###4343 And we did that through the flight all the way along.
###4347 It wasn't fast enough.
###4350 Out in front of the nose there were some dark patches.
###4352 That is where tile were, white tile, and fell off during launch.
###4356 They actually found some washed up on the beach.
###4358 Fortunately, none of the black tile on the bottom fell off but we did lose some on the
###4364 top.
###4364 Zero G is really one of the delights.
###4371 There are two really good things about flying in orbit, weightlessness and the view out
###4379 the window.
###4379 And that is like nothing that you experience, even flying high-performance airplanes.
###4386 We had the RMS cranked up.
###4389 That was my job as RMS operator.
###4392 And we had a package in the back, the plasma diagnostic package to grab and move out there.
###4398 There are some things that show you the housekeeping area.
###4400 In the corner there is the john.
###4411 And long duration spaceflight exercise is important.
###4414 It is really not a big deal on a seven-day flight.
###4419 Jack is a Marine, as I mentioned.
###4427 He has got to have his daily ration of pushups, so here we go.
###4431 How about a one-handed pushup, Jack?
###4434 How about a no-handed pushup?
###4447 This is a quick summary.
###4449 We went our seven days.
###4451 And the lakebed at Edwards, they had a really wet spring, was unusable, so we went to White
###4458 Sands, New Mexico.
###4460 The first day, right as we are about to light the OMS engines to start deorbit, they said
###4468 hold off because this terrible dust storm is going on.
###4472 And then we waited a delightful day with nothing in the flight plane much to enjoy ourselves,
###4480 and then came down the next day.
###4482 Now we find another gotcha in handling quantities here.
###4489 Right here Jack thought the nose might be coming down too fast and tried to stop it,
###4494 and ended up doing a little wheelie.
###4498 Subsequent analysis showed that the whole response of the vehicle changes when you are
###4503 down on the main gear only.
###4505 And nobody thought of that.
###4507 It would seem like, well, they are worried about pitch in the air but not while you are
###4516 rolling on the main gear trying to de-rotate.
###4518 So it resulted in more software changes.
###4521 Another thing we learned, they were pushing for auto-land.
###4531 We flew the whole turn onto final and down final hands off in auto-land.
###4536 The program wanted to take this out of the hands of the crew, so here on the third flight
###4545 they had us sitting there watching the airplane fly down to pre-flare.
###4549 And then the first chance Jack got to grab the stick was at the last minute to do the
###4555 flare and landing.
###4557 And that was dumb when you look back, really dumb.
###4559 And so, now all flight commanders, if it has been auto down to 40,000 feet where you go
###4567 subsonic, we will fly manually all the way down to get a feel for the airplane.
###4571 It makes a lot more sense.
###4573 That is the way flights are done now.
###4574 Here is where we started from orbit.
###4578 This is how Cape Canaveral looks.
###4581 Right here is the shuttle landing strip that is down there.
###4584 You can see it.
###4585 And the launch pads are these two dots.
###4588 And so, that is where usually a shuttle flight starts and ends.
###4594 Here is a picture of our payload bay on STS-3.
###4597 And we did have a payload.
###4600 Previous crews had pretty much empty payload bay, but we had an environmental measurement
###4608 thing, a lot of instrumentation.
###4611 Then this PDP, Plasma Diagnostic Package that we actually had something to grab with the
###4619 manipulator arm, as you see here.
###4620 I looked around and found, I don't know if you can recognize this, but that is Cape Cod
###4628 back there.
###4628 A picture of MIT.
###4633 Not a good picture.
###4634 There have got to be lots of better ones.
###4636 And here is where we ended up, the White Sands area near Alamogordo, New Mexico.
###4642 What we learned, this is a pretty cryptic summary.
###4651 Training was a real problem.
###4653 The first two crews that flew STS-1 and STS-2 had all the attention of the training people
###4663 in the simulators.
###4664 They had priority, properly so.
###4668 We, on the third flight, had low priority and really struggled.
###4675 And what we found, when we got in the simulators, is when they didn't work right nobody could
###4680 explain why.
###4683 Many times we try on ascent and crash and burn.
###4686 And you always were scratching your head is this real?
###4689 Is this the way the orbiter flies or is it some flaw in the simulator?
###4692 Early on you are developing not only the orbiter but the training facilities.
###4700 And the people didn't understand the system.
###4702 We had more exposure from ALT to subsystems than the people that were supposed to be the
###4708 experts.
###4709 It was a group learning process and a long way from what happens now when crews go in.
###4716 And they get the straight word right from the beginning on how things are.
###4720 The tiles fell off.
###4723 Not good.
###4723 They changed the bonding scheme, improved the quality control and, fortunately for the
###4732 program, no critical tiles fell off.
###4735 But that was alarming.
###4737 We looked out there, we reported it, took pictures of it looking at these gaps in the
###4744 system right out in front of the windshield.
###4746 But Ground said don't worry, that is a cool area during entry.
###4753 Entry is at 40 degrees angle of attack so it is cool on top.
###4758 They were right.
###4759 Everything was fine.
###4763 Another tile thing was after the flight, actually, delay that.
###4769 It was really more after the next flight.
###4772 I mentioned how the ride is.
###4776 The first two minutes were rough and exciting.
###4780 The next six or seven are unbelievably smooth when you get on the main engines, and then
###4789 more vibration that you are getting sitting in the chairs now.
###4792 And it is just a steady relentless push.
###4794 It is just a spectacular right.
###4798 But you are back in the seat.
###4803 Had an APU oil overheat during that 3G part.
###4809 Actually, about two minutes before MECO, Ground called and said we needed to shut down one
###4815 APU.
###4815 We were up past the point where we could live without all three APUs running.
###4821 I had a chance to test what I worked on years previously with the cockpit design.
###4828 You are concerned about visibility when you are squashed in the seat at 3Gs and access.
###4835 And the APU switches, we had to put them down here.
###4840 And, I remember worrying specifically, if we have got to get to the APU switches, the
###4848 guy on the right seat under 3Gs, can he lift the helmet and look over there and find the
###4852 correct switch?
###4853 And you do not want to shut down the wrong one, one of the good ones.
###4858 And it turned out, I guess with the adrenaline lifting this heavy helmet at 3Gs, I did it
###4868 without even thinking about it and went right to the switch.
###4870 So it worked.
###4877 General habitability was good in the orbiter.
###4879 The first time anybody lived there for eight days.
###4886 A good way to think about living in the orbiter, think of it as a camping trip.
###4890 You go on a camping trip you don't worry about hot water, showers and all the niceties of
###4897 home.
###4899 You get in that frame of mind and it is fine.
###4901 The food is adequate, the facilities are OK, although in our case the toilet ground to
###4911 a halt.
###4912 It is a drum that rotates to centrifugally sling all fecal material out and contain it.
###4920 And it ground to a halt.
###4922 We were in a real camping trip for a while on that, although it worked out.
###4933 The arm worked great, RMS.
###4936 The main jets I mentioned earlier.
###4939 Of course, you don't use the main jets much.
###4943 It would be hard to sleep with them booming away, but you use the Verniers most of the
###4947 time.
###4947 Verniers are critical to smooth operation over long periods of time.
###4952 We spent a lot of time, for instance, tail sun.
###4959 For like three days we put the tail right at the sun and stayed in that inertial attitude.
###4965 And so it cooked the backend while the front end of the orbiter is cold.
###4971 We took all the Theodolite measurements, opened and closed the doors.
###4976 All of that worked fine.
###4978 The systems handled it.
###4979 A lot of it was ground analysis.
###4981 And how the temperatures were, were extensively instrumented.
###4986 And we did notice a strange thing.
###4992 Not strange but it became apparent.
###4995 When you are in orbit, when you are on the sunny side of the earth, as soon as the sun
###5004 comes up it is high noon bright, but there is no atmosphere around to diffuse the light.
###5011 When we were at tail sun, it is hidden behind perfectly eclipsed by the aft structure.
###5018 And so, there is no sun ball to be seen anywhere, even though it is bright sunny from just the
###5026 reflections of the structure you can see out the window.
###5030 I noticed, looking at the radiators, which are very, very smooth concave surfaces out
###5038 there and shiny silver colored.
###5041 It looked like there were bright diamonds all along the surface when we were tail sun.
###5049 And I finally figured out it was just little specks of dust on the radiators, which you
###5054 wouldn't even notice normally.
###5056 But exactly tail sun, the sun's rays are coming right down exactly tangent to that surface.
###5064 And the least little thing on it would flare.
###5068 And interesting effect which took me a while to figure out what all these bright spots
###5076 on the radiators are.
###5084 Entry on STS-3 was done to an about 1:00 in the morning landing at White Sands, New Mexico.
###5093 We started the entry.
###5094 Halfway around the world it is dark, and most of the entry was in the dark.
###5100 The plasma light show that happens, as you get down in the atmosphere, the ionization
###5105 that happens produces a spectacular scene out the windshield.
###5111 I mean it also had us thinking about the missing tiles that are going.
###5119 But a night entry is really a show.
###5124 The next flight was a day entry which was not nearly as spectacular.
###5129 I mentioned about grabbing the stick too late, unfair to Jack, and then the de-rotation.
###5141 Now onto part three.
###5143 How am I doing?
###5145 I might make it yet.
###5146 STS-51F was a whole different situation than the earlier test flights.
###5160 One big difference is there were seven people instead of two.
###5165 With seven we had to add a little bit on the patch to put the extra two names.
###5169 This is the ninth flight.
###5172 There are nineteen stars.
###5175 Primary experiments.
###5175 This was a science flight.
###5176 It was a space lab but without the laboratory.
###5179 All equipment in the payload bay full stem to stern with telescopes mostly.
###5185 And all the telescopes mounted on the pointing system we had were solar telescopes.
###5191 So we had the sun in the accurate part of the sky.
###5197 Here is Orion and Leo, the backwards question mark.
###5206 Nineteen stars.
###5211 A lot of symbology here.
###5221 A short entertaining video.
###5233 We had seven people, including three mission specialists, which Dr.
###5242 Hoffman was when he was down in Houston.
###5245 And we had two payload specialists, guys who were not full time astronauts.
###5251 They were solar physicists.
###5253 And they were the experts on the solar telescopes that we had and went along to fly.
###5259 First try here at main engine ignition ended three seconds after ignition.
###5263 We felt the spacecraft rock around, the noise and then nothing.
###5271 And we had a pad shutdown because the left engine, the automatic system detected a failure,
###5280 a slow-acting valve and it shut us off.
###5282 So we are there wondering if we are on fire and whether we ought to race out and so forth.
###5287 It was tense for a while but there wasn't a fire, just this automatic shutdown.
###5293 We crawled out.
###5295 We were told there would be a two-week delay, so we took the kids to Disneyland and had
###5304 a good time, went back home and started the whole training cycle again.
###5308 And came back two weeks later and got a good start this time.
###5314 But not after lying on our back on the pads strapped in for five hours because of some
###5321 software glitches that had to be fixed and computers reloaded and tested.
###5328 And one of our reports was five hours is the limit.
###5332 I mean you are lying on your back with your feet up in a pressure suit strapped in.
###5338 That is more than is reasonable to ask prior to launch.
###5348 On the way up, well, I will mention that later.
###5350 Here is the instrument system.
###5352 This baby was built in Germany.
###5355 It is this gimbal device that held these four solar telescopes and the star trackers.
###5363 Here is a physics experiment.
###5365 The OMS engines are lit and produces one-sixteenth of a G.
###5370 The thrust of the orbital maneuvering engines.
###5373 If you are trying to sleep, that is what happens when the OMS engines come on.
###5377 And you saw the water going across.
###5384 It is déjà vu.
###5386 We had the same old PDP package on this, but with a difference this time.
###5392 We took it out of the payload bay and brought it up here.
###5394 That is my right ear you are looking at in profile out the window.
###5399 It is crowded up there with seven people up on the flight deck all trying to get a view
###5405 here, but we let go of it.
###5407 And it had a momentum wheel in there to cause it to spin up slowly.
###5413 And we backed away from it and flew a couple of very challenging loops around it.
###5422 Here is a sequel to the hairbrush.
###5426 This is not me.
###5426 It is Story Musgrave who has the same hairdo as I do.
###5433 And he is getting spiffed up for the TV show.
###5437 That is all we did is horse around for seven days.
###5460 It got extended a day to eight days again.
###5464 And this landing was back at Edwards, runway 23 on August 6th when it was 105 degrees,
###5473 lots of heat waves.
###5477 This landing was by far the most forward CG because we still had all that equipment in
###5482 the payload bay.
###5484 And we were almost the heaviest orbiter landing, so getting the nose down before it fell down,
###5492 crashed and broke the nose gear was one of my primary concerns on this one.
###5521 More about the actual launch itself.
###5524 There is the customary view.
###5525 They put a camera right in close and got this really close-up view, but it was about 5.5
###5538 minutes after this picture.
###5541 We had delayed five hours.
###5542 It is late afternoon so very quickly heading out over the Atlantic we were in darkness.
###5550 And then, bang.
###5551 Remember the left engine got us on the pad abort?
###5558 Well, the center engine shut down.
###5562 We were at 3Gs and all of a sudden we are at 2Gs or something like that.
###5567 Instant square wave cutoff and acceleration.
###5573 Looking there and confirming the center engine shut down.
###5576 What happened was there are a number of sensors on the main engines.
###5581 The particular one that got us was the fuel high pressure turbo pump.
###5589 A piece of machinery running at 75,000 RPM high pressures.
###5599 The high-tech gear that makes the main engine so efficient, IISP, but really run at the
###5606 limits of metallurgy and technology.
###5611 The sensor that senses the output temperature was a series of four platinum wires in the
###5616 cavity in the output of that turbo pump.
###5622 They had some tendency for the wires to burn through.
###5625 When they burn through, they showed over-temp was the electrical result of a burn through,
###5633 one of these sensors.
###5634 Well, we had two burn throughs.
###5636 And the software said that must mean there are two sensors that say you are too hot,
###5643 I will shut the motor off.
###5644 And it did.
###5646 With no reaction we just kept going straight and smooth, but it now put us into what is
###5660 called an abort.
###5661 Well, here is the crew.
###5664 There are seven of us.
###5666 I need to practice this more.
###5673 But, anyway, it was a two shift operation.
###5675 We were going to work around the clock, so we had a red team and a blue team.
###5679 And I was the commander so I had a striped shirt.
###5684 Abort to orbit.
###5684 We had to call from the ground, confirm what we knew already, which means turning that
###5689 rotary knob to ATO, abort to orbit, kind of an oxymoron in a way.
###5694 It is not really an abort.
###5695 It is pressing on and pushing the button behind it.
###5698 It loads the software in to do a couple of things, lower the insertion target.
###5704 We had tried to get as high orbit as performance would permit, but now we are going lower.
###5711 Engine down costs you total performance.
###5715 And we also started dumping OMS fuel.
###5720 We had to turn on the OMS engines, and we ended up dumping 4500 pounds of OMS fuel,
###5726 a little bit of extra thrust but a significant loss of weight to allow the remaining performance
###5734 to get us to an acceptable orbit.
###5738 And, interestingly, the last sim we did in training in Houston, before we went to the
###5744 Cape to fly about two days before, was an integrated sim where we are tied into all
###5751 the controllers and everybody is working as a team.
###5753 And the very last run we had was an ATO, abort to orbit.
###5759 And, son of a gun, that is what we did.
###5761 We always had trouble starting a watch.
###5765 And you try to do everything internally on the crew so that if you lose communication
###5769 with the ground you can complete the emergency properly on your own.
###5775 On ATOs before, we had to start a stopwatch at the time we started the OMS dump.
###5782 And we had a chart to go in to find out how many minutes of OMS dump we needed to do given
###5787 at what velocity we lost the engine.
###5791 And Story's job was to do the watch.
###5793 In the excitement of all the other stuff we had to do to get the OMS on, we would always
###5799 forget the watch.
###5799 But this time he got the watch going so we actually did it right.
###5803 And we knew that when we got to where we burned out all the available fuel, which we did,
###5811 we went to a fuel depletion cutoff, that we would be really close to having to do right
###5821 away another OMS burn to get an acceptable orbit.
###5824 We are right on the boundary, as it turned out.
###5829 We dumped the right amount of OMS, every last drop of main propellant gone, we were just
###5836 on the boundary of not having to do the first OMS burn and we could relax 45 minutes later
###5846 halfway around the world to do the final circularization.
###5849 So it worked out good, except we were in a lot lower orbit than we had planned.
###5855 And everything about this space lab flight depended on the orbit, so we were into a giant
###5860 re-plan.
###5861 Here is a nice picture of the IPS.
###5865 Gordon, I also explain the situation of the inhibit switch on and off.
###5875 I don't know how much you were aware of what was going on there in the cockpit.
###5882 There is a switch in the cockpit.
###5888 You have a lot of parameters that are monitored in the software on the main engines which,
###5893 if they go out of tolerance, will shut the engine off.
###5897 In fact, that is exactly why we lost the center engine.
###5904 But, right after that engine shutdown, we were in a state where we really don't want
###5908 to lose another engine.
###5909 Because if, with only one left, we did not have the performance to get to orbit, we would
###5915 have had to have gone to Zaragoza, Spain and land in the middle of the night where it was
###5922 a 10,000 foot overcast and raining.
###5925 I mean if we pulled that off we would have deserved some kind of metal.
###5931 And so, as a preplanned procedure, when you lose one engine before, the point where you
###5939 can stagger into orbit on one remaining engine you inhibit the limits.
###5945 You throw a switch that says you're telling the engines to keep running regardless of
###5953 over-temps or anything because you take the chance, which is a big one if something let
###5958 go, to not be susceptible that got us for the first engine, that is a sensor failure.
###5968 And so we did that.
###5969 We inhibited the limits until we got to a point in the energy profile where we were
###5975 "press to MECO." That is the call.
###5977 Press to MECO means that you are now at a velocity where you can make it into acceptable
###5985 low orbit on one engine if you should lose another one.
###5991 Press to MECO then the plan was we will re-enable the limits so we are not hanging it out on
###5999 a possible second engine failure.
###6003 And we would accept a second engine failure because we knew we could make it on one engine.
###6007 So we did that, the call came up, we went to enable.
###6012 And then, before we got there, we got another call from the ground that said go back to
###6017 inhibit.
###6018 Well, it wasn't time to get a full explanation.
###6021 We dutifully did it.
###6023 What they saw on the ground is more failures on the right engine.
###6028 Remember the left got us on the pad abort?
###6030 The center engine shut down on the way up.
###6032 And, to make everything equal, the right engine, the same sensors they can see on the ground,
###6039 it is not visible in the cockpit, each of those four platinum wires they saw starting
###6045 to go.
###6047 Clearly a design problem here.
###6050 And they could tell those were going to go and get us that second engine, so that is
###6055 why we went back to inhibit for the rest of the way.
###6058 It made a good war story, but we got there.
###6064 We started operating the IPS.
###6070 A platform built in Germany with all the telescopes.
###6075 These are start trackers to align where it is.
###6079 And this baby could point.
###6082 The spec was one arch second of accuracy.
###6086 An arch second is the size of a dime.
###6089 If you are standing at the capital and looking at dime at the Lincoln Memorial, that is how
###6096 much.
###6098 But, when we cranked it up, it didn't work worth a hoot.
###6102 They just couldn't get it to stabilize or point where it was supposed to.
###6106 And, for three days, the payload specialists and the MSs were in constant communication
###6112 with the ground.
###6114 And they patched the software in a major way and kept sending up new software loads to
###6119 get this thing to work.
###6121 And viola, on the third day they finally got it right, then it worked well and got a lot
###6129 of good solar science.
###6134 Just an aside, when you are looking at pictures from space, you tend to think you walk around
###6143 out here and the atmosphere is this big ocean of air above you, right?
###6146 Lots of air way up there.
###6150 This little bitty blue line right there, barely perceptible, there always appears on any sunlit
###6157 picture showing the limb of the earth, that is the same blue as the scattering that causes
###6166 the sky to be blue.
###6167 And that is how thick it is.
###6170 It is just this little thin shell of atmosphere around.
###6174 At 18,000 feet three miles up you have lost half the atmospheric pressure.
###6185 And that is laying on an 8,000 mile diameter globe.
###6190 And so that is where all of human history has happened, in that little shell over there
###6198 laying around the globe.
###6199 A philosophical point for you engineers.
###6205 What is flying on orbit like?
###6208 Well, it is one of the 215 pounds of checklist.
###6214 Here I am checking propellant usage against what we've got and where we are because we
###6219 dumped 4,500 pounds of crucial fuel that we needed to make the planned most maneuvers
###6229 that ever been done in the orbit on our mission.
###6235 We didn't want an extra blip out of an RCS thruster, and it worked very well.
###6241 We got through seven days and even had enough to have another day of science on the eighth
###6247 day.
###6247 Flying is mostly watching the clock.
###6251 Everything happens according to time.
###6255 And, since you have 16 sunrises and sunsets every 24 hours, you never know what time it
###6261 is without looking at a watch.
###6264 And you are looking at a crew activity plan with everything laid out.
###6269 And we even had an alarm system you could set in the CRT to make a tone to wake you
###6280 up.
###6280 It is a lot of clock watching to pull off a complex mission like this.
###6285 It is just the way life is on orbit.
###6287 Now, here is one of our really serious high-level scientific objectives.
###6296 This was the official name, the Carbonated Beverage Test.
###6299 I don't know if it was an MIT guy or not.
###6304 He was a real serious academic type.
###6309 An Indian I think.
###6312 Anyway, he built a Coke can that had a lot of pressure regulators in there and laminar
###6323 flow annular things.
###6327 So many that this Coke can only held four ounces of Coke.
###6331 But he talked to the White House.
###6334 Reagan was president.
###6335 And somebody on the staff approved we are going to fly these Coke cans and see if they
###6342 had a system to provide pop in orbit with the regular kind of carbonation and dispense
###6349 OK.
###6351 We got the briefing and we had the four stowed in a locker.
###6355 And I got them out at the start of the test.
###6357 But 30 days before launch, all of a sudden this big thing came down.
###6363 Pepsi got wind of this experiment and went to the White House staff and they got Pepsi
###6370 put on.
###6371 Pepsi went into a crash program to fly more cans of Pepsi.
###6379 Here is Carl trying the Pepsi.
###6384 You notice that looks a lot like a shaving cream can.
###6389 Well, that's how the Pepsi came out, just like shaving cream, this frothy ball of stuff.
###6395 I mean theirs was the last minute deal.
###6397 It didn't have any pressure regulators in it.
###6401 It just went out there.
###6407 Now we worried about having to make a judgment, which tasted better.
###6411 Well, the problem was we didn't have any kind of refrigerator so they are both warm.
###6418 Warm pop is not my favorite.
###6424 And so, they were not anything anybody fought over, either kind.
###6436 If you let the Pepsi float around it would coalesce a little CO2 in random fashion, but
###6443 the physics of it, Carl found by blowing very carefully on the edge you could get it spinning
###6451 up.
###6453 And spinning Pepsi would have the froth at the poles and the liquid around the equator.
###6460 And we always had a tall guy standing by in case it drifted into something.
###6471 This is the end of the experiment here.
###6472 He got it into his mouth without touching any of it.
###6479 We had the same PDP but, as I mentioned and as you saw in the movie, we let go of it.
###6486 We actually maneuvered all around the orbit and looked at the wake through the plasma,
###6490 let go of it.
###6491 The proximity ops were very extensive and challenging and many, many maneuvers.
###6498 That is in the Caribbean.
###6500 The tongue of the ocean.
###6501 A spectacular coral reef around very deep water.
###6505 Here is the Gibraltar.
###6508 The rock, I believe, is out on the point.
###6512 The Mediterranean here and the Atlantic here.
###6518 You've heard you cannot see borders in space.
###6520 Not true.
###6521 This is Israel this way and Egypt this way and the Gaza strip along here, which has been
###6529 in the news as of late.
###6533 And in the same area the Dead Sea, the Sea of Galilee.
###6536 Here is most of Israel in one picture.
###6538 A little closer to home.
###6544 This is most of New Jersey.
###6546 Long Island.
###6547 There is Manhattan.
###6548 Hudson River and East River.
###6551 There are about 10,000 copies of this picture.
###6558 This is Southern California.
###6560 This is San Diego right here.
###6561 Los Angeles.
###6563 And, in high rise print, you can see water here which is San Francisco Bay.
###6569 And the center of it all is the Antelope Valley right here where I live and where Edwards
###6576 is right here.
###6578 This is the San Andreas Fault right through here.
###6584 Closer up of LA which, at the end of 51F, we came right by Catalina Island, right up
###6592 the Harbor Freeway into Edwards.
###6594 And we went by Harbor Freeway at about mach 3.
###6603 And closer up of the dry lake at Edwards.
###6606 And the landing.
###6608 Flight test results most of which I have mentioned already.
###6615 And, to finish up, I have reports on a memory stick here, the pilot reports we wrote as
###6624 crews which you can take at your leisure.
###6628 If you are interested, copy it off.
###6630 They are available.
###6632 Not great works of art, but the specific things that we learned on doing the flight test.
###6641 And these are just thoughts of transitioning into operation from test mode, which I got
###6650 to see the whole gamut from beginning to full operational.
###6653 I apologize for running over.
###6656 I don't think anybody minded.
###6660 As you see, everybody is listening very intently.
###6664 Thank you very much for taking the time.
###6666 [APPLAUSE]
