CODEX: Last night was a
miscommunication, that's all.

When I was on the phone with
Fawkes yesterday, I'm pretty


420
0:11:34,13 --> 0:11:35,57
sure I heard rock sound effects
in the background.


421
0:11:35,57 --> 0:11:37,451
Which meant he was ready to give
Venom her sentence, which


422
0:11:37,451 --> 0:11:38,93
is super intense on the
leadership side.


423

Plus, I just dance around
things too much.


424
0:11:40,9 --> 0:11:43,66
I should have just come out and
said, Do you want to get


425
0:11:43,66 --> 0:11:45,57
together tonight for a date?


426
0:11:45,57 --> 0:11:47,435
Sure, part of me is, like,
Is he the jerk I


427
0:11:47,435 --> 0:11:48,33
thought he was before?


428
0:11:48,33 --> 0:11:50,32
Or is that just a facade, hiding
the really cool dude


429
0:11:50,32 --> 0:11:53,3
who made me feel pretty, and
awesome, and who I impulsively


430
0:11:53,3 --> 0:11:55,19
went way too far with?


431
0:11:55,19 --> 0:11:56,67
I'll just wait for
him to call me.


432
0:11:56,67 --> 0:11:57,36
Or I could text him.


433
0:11:57,36 --> 0:11:57,69

parts in here.


441
0:12:6,43 --> 0:12:8,98

van art whipped it

0:12:42,14 --> 0:12:43,76
right up for me.


463
0:12:43,76 --> 0:12:45,8
The likenesses are
pretty special.


464
0:12:45,8 --> 0:12:48,36
And, potentially, could end
up on the side of a van.


465
0:12:48,36 --> 0:12:49,75

0:12:52,74 --> 0:12:54,15
But I'm in support.

ZABOO'S MOM: Hello, Sujan.


484

It's my birthday soon, and for
me the best present would be

of your voice.

0:13:19,82 --> 0:13:21,5
ZABOO: OK?


490
0:13:21,5 --> 0:13:21,59
You met my mom.


491
0:13:21,59 --> 0:13:24,3
You know that OK would never
be used to describe her.

Sometimes people change.

you find out they aren't
jerks anymore.

they really are the jerks that
you thought they were, you

ZABOO: You know, a human
red-haired female priest with


613
0:16:32,26 --> 0:16:35,55
an elite herald tunic
isn't uncommon.

you should--

0:16:37,35 --> 0:16:37,82
You're right.

0:16:37,82 --> 0:16:38,94
Because we're dating.


618
0:16:38,94 --> 0:16:39,75
I should be able to do that.

0:16:39,75 --> 0:16:40,89
ZABOO: Yeah, you
go, girlfriend.

0:16:40,89 --> 0:16:41,29

don't you just get drunk and


623
0:16:44,23 --> 0:16:45,4
show up at his doorstep?


624
0:16:45,4 --> 0:16:46,48

0:16:49,609 --> 0:16:50,6
CODEX: Hi.


628
0:16:50,6 --> 0:16:50,94
It's Codex.


629
0:16:50,94 --> 0:16:52,42
Uh, did you get your jacket?


630
0:16:52,42 --> 0:16:53,22
FAWKES: I did.


631
0:16:53,22 --> 0:16:55,27
CODEX: I kind of thought you'd
pick it up yourself.

0:16:55,27 --> 0:16:56,7
FAWKES: You can't
undo the past.


633
0:16:56,7 --> 0:16:58,53
But you can certainly
not repeat it.

set a time now?

To go out together?

0:17:4,16 --> 0:17:5,455
For-- for a date?


639
0:17:5,455 --> 0:17:7,31
FAWKES: Yeah, I thought I made
this clear between us.


640
0:17:7,31 --> 0:17:8,609
I don't date.

0:17:9,99 --> 0:17:9,53
No.

No, that certainly was not
clear, because I don't do one

0:17:28,42 --> 0:17:29,49
I am a good girl.

The worst thing I've ever done
is sniff a permanent marker.

0:17:32,8 --> 0:17:34,88
But it was only 15 seconds,

about that date?

Eh, that rhymes.


660
0:17:41,79 --> 0:17:44,73
But with a little logic, and a
mild panic attack, I convinced

for a non date-

calmly, and then we
will go out again.


665
0:17:50,98 --> 0:17:51,96
We have to.


666
0:17:51,96 --> 0:17:53,31

Um, why are we not going
out again, again?

in one-on-one combat in the

you have earned my respect.

However, I have a strict
one date only policy.

then I move on.

have so much in common.

to play the

you know what?

0:18:31,41 --> 0:18:33,23

here, or I would never have

great chemistry.

That's something.

how we were all base and

go out again.

But the thing is, I kind of
told the guild about us.

about our one night of

up in conversation.

So I'm just gonna tell the guild
that we're still going


718
0:19:14,4 --> 0:19:16,615

longer, and I would appreciate

it if you would cover for me.

a lot of thought into this.

Your best friend's boyfriend
broke up with her.

Do you, A, pamper her with a
trip to a relaxing day spa; B,

take her out for salsa dancing;
or C, comfort her

ZABOO: Why C?


771
0:20:32,1 --> 0:20:34,34
VORK: The majority of multiple
choice answers are always C.


772
0:20:34,34 --> 0:20:37,55
In addition, comfort requires
emotional commitment, and


773
0:20:37,55 --> 0:20:40,29
salsa dancing is performed
in poor lighting.


774
0:20:40,29 --> 0:20:42,55

and start a-mining.

It's so nice to hear
your voice.

for my birthday?

ZABOO: Uh, yes, but I'm
not gonna make it.


789
0:21:0,11 --> 0:21:2,7
And I notice that you invited
Dad, and he's dead, so he's


790

probably not gonna
make it, either.

0:21:28,46 --> 0:21:29,36
ZABOO: C.


810
0:21:29,36 --> 0:21:31,6
BLADEZZ: He stuck you
with the bill, too.


811
0:21:31,6 --> 0:21:32,87
I have to take lessons
from this guy--


812
0:21:32,87 --> 0:21:33,24
CODEX: Shut up.


813
0:21:33,24 --> 0:21:34,26
It was a great second date.


814
0:21:34,26 --> 0:21:35,44
We are so into each other.


815
0:21:35,44 --> 0:21:35,695
BLADEZZ: Hm.


816
0:21:35,695 --> 0:21:36,65
CODEX: And I why don't
we talk about


817
0:21:36,65 --> 0:21:37,81
something that's your business?


818
0:21:37,81 --> 0:21:38,69
Like my computer?


819
0:21:38,69 --> 0:21:40,65
That you supposedly fixed,
that barely works?


820
0:21:40,65 --> 0:21:41,77
How am I supposed to play?


821
0:21:41,77 --> 0:21:42,98
BLADEZZ: Oh, OK.


822
0:21:42,98 --> 0:21:45,545
Give me 50 bucks for a second
house call, I'll check it out.


823
0:21:45,545 --> 0:21:46,61
CODEX: 50 bucks?


824
0:21:46,61 --> 0:21:47,805
I told you, I'm really poor.


825
0:21:47,805 --> 0:21:50,92
You're supposed to
be my friend.


826
0:21:50,92 --> 0:21:52,86
BLADEZZ: Jesus, woman, you
need to be tranqed.


827
0:21:52,86 --> 0:21:53,335
CODEX: I'm sorry.


828
0:21:53,335 --> 0:21:55,33
It's just, I'm so stressed
right now.


829
0:21:55,33 --> 0:21:57,2
I just have to have
a computer.


830
0:21:57,2 --> 0:21:59,806
For the guild hall, for living--
it's, like, so


831
0:21:59,806 --> 0:22:0,48
important--


832
0:22:0,48 --> 0:22:1,15
BLADEZZ: OK.


833
0:22:1,15 --> 0:22:2,25
Don't leak.


834
0:22:2,25 --> 0:22:5,39
If you need quick dough,
Bladezz'll hook you up.


835
0:22:5,39 --> 0:22:6,64
Go.


836
0:22:6,64 --> 0:22:13,42



837
0:22:13,42 --> 0:22:15,53
OLLIE: So, Sherman.


838
0:22:15,53 --> 0:22:17,97
Just, um, who are you
to Simon here?


839
0:22:17,97 --> 0:22:18,825
CODEX: Uh, it's complicated--


840
0:22:18,825 --> 0:22:19,49
BLADEZZ: She's my cousin.


841
0:22:19,49 --> 0:22:20,81
OLLIE: The one who
had boob surgery?


842
0:22:20,81 --> 0:22:21,18
BLADEZZ: Yeah.


843
0:22:21,18 --> 0:22:22,17
She made 'em smaller.


844
0:22:22,17 --> 0:22:23,72
OLLIE: Went too far.


845
0:22:23,72 --> 0:22:25,54
So, you ever work
in food service?


846
0:22:25,54 --> 0:22:26,51
CODEX: I used to
be a musician.


847
0:22:26,51 --> 0:22:27,88
OLLIE: Musician, eh?


848
0:22:27,88 --> 0:22:29,98
Well, I used to be
semi-professional myself.


849
0:22:29,98 --> 0:22:31,49
Heh heh heh--


850
0:22:31,49 --> 0:22:32,815
pirate balladeer.


851
0:22:32,815 --> 0:22:36,21
(SINGING) So, they whacked me
up, they whacked me down, the


852
0:22:36,21 --> 0:22:38,6
first mate cracked me upon the
crown, and then they boogered


853
0:22:38,6 --> 0:22:41,137
me round and round, when
I was just a shaver.


854
0:22:41,137 --> 0:22:42,51
[LAUGHTER]


855
0:22:42,51 --> 0:22:43,79
CODEX: That's a lovely
baritone.


856
0:22:43,79 --> 0:22:47,576
OLLIE: Oh, I also sing
first tenor.


857
0:22:47,576 --> 0:22:48,75
Well, I--


858
0:22:48,75 --> 0:22:51,52
I'd like to throw you a life
jacket, lass, but, um, I'm not


859
0:22:51,52 --> 0:22:52,52
hiring right now.


860
0:22:52,52 --> 0:22:54,28
No, business is in the bilge.


861
0:22:54,28 --> 0:22:55,57
BLADEZZ: Aw, come on, boss.


862
0:22:55,57 --> 0:22:57,3
She's old and reliable
looking.


863
0:22:57,3 --> 0:22:58,28
Can't she swab something?


864
0:22:58,28 --> 0:23:0,44
CODEX: Well, look-- you
have a computer.


865
0:23:0,44 --> 0:23:0,85
Drool.


866
0:23:0,85 --> 0:23:1,785
OLLIE: Oh, that.


867
0:23:1,785 --> 0:23:4,18
Never turn on the blasted
contraption.


868
0:23:4,18 --> 0:23:6,7
CODEX: Wait, you've never
turned it on?


869
0:23:6,7 --> 0:23:7,52
Poor thing.


870
0:23:7,52 --> 0:23:8,87
Uh, do you need it?


871
0:23:8,87 --> 0:23:10,68
OLLIE: Oh, aye, yes.


872
0:23:10,68 --> 0:23:16,6
It-- it serves me well
as a paperweight.


873
0:23:16,6 --> 0:23:17,77
CODEX: Can I stay
here and use it?


874
0:23:17,77 --> 0:23:18,75
To help you?


875
0:23:18,75 --> 0:23:19,83
With business?


876
0:23:19,83 --> 0:23:20,533
OLLIE: How?


877
0:23:20,533 --> 0:23:21,34
CODEX: Uh--


878
0:23:21,34 --> 0:23:22,25
websites.


879
0:23:22,25 --> 0:23:24,35
Yes, websites, and, and
social networking.


880
0:23:24,35 --> 0:23:26,42
They can all get people
into your restaurant.


881
0:23:26,42 --> 0:23:27,17
Right?


882
0:23:27,17 --> 0:23:28,46
OLLIE: You can do that?


883
0:23:28,46 --> 0:23:29,34
CODEX: Yes.


884
0:23:29,34 --> 0:23:31,12
OLLIE: Well, slog
my jolly boat--


885
0:23:31,12 --> 0:23:32,29
BLADEZZ: Whoa, whoa, whoa.


886
0:23:32,29 --> 0:23:34,84
OK, I'm cool with throwing you
a bone, but if there's fun,


887
0:23:34,84 --> 0:23:37,575
white-collar work to be done,
I'll be the guy paid to do it.


888
0:23:37,575 --> 0:23:38,805
OLLIE: Oh, no way, lad.


889
0:23:38,805 --> 0:23:40,68
Gotta have you where
I need you.


890
0:23:40,68 --> 0:23:41,72
Grub master.


891
0:23:41,72 --> 0:23:42,606
Below decks.


892
0:23:42,606 --> 0:23:44,3
BLADEZZ: Bu,bu, but I--I--


893
0:23:44,3 --> 0:23:45,11
CODEX: Then I will do it.


894
0:23:45,11 --> 0:23:46,4
I am the lassie for the job.


895
0:23:46,4 --> 0:23:47,92
OLLIE: Never say
old Black Ollie


896
0:23:47,92 --> 0:23:49,67
didn't parlay with progress.


897
0:23:49,67 --> 0:23:53,35
You see, I'll give you a split
of the booty, if you can crew


898
0:23:53,35 --> 0:23:55,17
up those tables out there.


899
0:23:55,17 --> 0:23:57,5
Deal?


900
0:23:57,5 --> 0:23:58,4
CODEX: Aye, aye, Captain.


901
0:23:58,4 --> 0:24:0,13
[LAUGHTER]


902
0:24:0,13 --> 0:24:1,12
OLLIE: Arrgh--


903
0:24:1,12 --> 0:24:2,655
CODEX: Arrgh--


904
0:24:2,655 --> 0:24:3,905
Heh heh--


905
0:24:3,905 --> 0:24:6,4



906
0:24:6,4 --> 0:24:7,65
Bladezz got me a job.


907
0:24:7,65 --> 0:24:9,93
That he's pissed at me for
getting, but, whatever.


908
0:24:9,93 --> 0:24:10,57
A job.


909
0:24:10,57 --> 0:24:13,43
It's been so long, it feels
weird coming out of my mouth.


910
0:24:13,43 --> 0:24:14,5
Job.


911
0:24:14,5 --> 0:24:14,95
Job.


912
0:24:14,95 --> 0:24:16,6
Job.


913
0:24:16,6 --> 0:24:16,93
OK.


914
0:24:16,93 --> 0:24:17,38
I'll stop.


915
0:24:17,38 --> 0:24:20,26
I'm not technically qualified,
or getting paid up front--


916
0:24:20,26 --> 0:24:21,38
which is so like me--


917
0:24:21,38 --> 0:24:23,32
but I think I can do this.


918
0:24:23,32 --> 0:24:25,15
Social media can't
be that hard.


919
0:24:25,15 --> 0:24:27,17
Every bozo on the internet
claims to be an expert.


920
0:24:27,17 --> 0:24:29,98
And, I think I worked out the
whole Fawkes thing, so by the


921
0:24:29,98 --> 0:24:32,22
end of week, I will have a brand
new computer, and be


922
0:24:32,22 --> 0:24:34,2
innocuously broken up in
a face-saving manner.


923
0:24:34,2 --> 0:24:36,25
Life is pretty good right now.


924
0:24:36,25 --> 0:24:37,45
Why did I say that?


925
0:24:37,45 --> 0:24:39,24
I just totally jinxed it.


926
0:24:39,24 --> 0:24:41,74
Ohh--


927
0:24:41,74 --> 0:24:43,78
CLARA: I can't believe
you got a job, Codex.


928
0:24:43,78 --> 0:24:45,12
I'm so jealous.


929
0:24:45,12 --> 0:24:46,39
Is it glamorous?


930
0:24:46,39 --> 0:24:47,64
Are you wearing a
pencil skirt?


931
0:24:47,64 --> 0:24:49,57
VORK: The important question
is, can I get a discount on


932
0:24:49,57 --> 0:24:50,32
foodstuffs?


933
0:24:50,32 --> 0:24:51,6
Namely, discounted to free.


934
0:24:51,6 --> 0:24:53,51
CODEX: It's a little early to
be asking for free stuff.


935
0:24:53,51 --> 0:24:55,53
I've gotta get paying customers
in here first.


936
0:24:55,53 --> 0:24:58,27
But it is nice to have a
working computer again.


937
0:24:58,27 --> 0:24:59,45
I named her Harriett.


938
0:24:59,45 --> 0:25:1,62
CLARA: Do people really hate
Cheesybeards' food that much?


939
0:25:1,62 --> 0:25:3,14
I thought their cosmos
were good.


940
0:25:3,14 --> 0:25:4,66
ZABOO: Some of these comments
are horrible.


941
0:25:4,66 --> 0:25:5,78
Leaky disaster.


942
0:25:5,78 --> 0:25:7,8
Tastes like butt pirate butt.


943
0:25:7,8 --> 0:25:8,32
VORK: Ahh--


944
0:25:8,32 --> 0:25:8,83
CODEX: I know.


945
0:25:8,83 --> 0:25:10,86
And Ollie doesn't even
own the domain name.


946
0:25:10,86 --> 0:25:12,95
I had to get Cheesybeards.info.


947
0:25:12,95 --> 0:25:14,42
CLARA: You get to buy
domain names?


948
0:25:14,42 --> 0:25:17,22
Ah, you're such a
jet-setter now.


949
0:25:17,22 --> 0:25:17,72
Wah--


950
0:25:17,72 --> 0:25:18,71
MR. WIGGLY: What's wrong?


951
0:25:18,71 --> 0:25:19,622
Are you guys-- ?


952
0:25:19,622 --> 0:25:20,78
Oh.


953
0:25:20,78 --> 0:25:21,53
I thought it was one
of the kids.


954
0:25:21,53 --> 0:25:23,32
CLARA: Honey, Codex got a job.


955
0:25:23,32 --> 0:25:25,65
She's working from work and
having so much fun right now.


956
0:25:25,65 --> 0:25:26,93
MR. WIGGLY: You have
a job, Bunny.


957
0:25:26,93 --> 0:25:29,24
It's the most important
job of all.


958
0:25:29,24 --> 0:25:30,456
Being a mom.


959
0:25:30,456 --> 0:25:33,788
[BLENDER SOUND]


960
0:25:33,788 --> 0:25:34,264
Gabby?


961
0:25:34,264 --> 0:25:36,17
CLARA: Meh.


962
0:25:36,17 --> 0:25:37,7
Oo, Codex--


963
0:25:37,7 --> 0:25:39,67
I saw that picture of you and
Fawkes that Bladezz posted.


964
0:25:39,67 --> 0:25:42,52
Talk about a two- hander.


965
0:25:42,52 --> 0:25:43,1
What?


966
0:25:43,1 --> 0:25:45,61
TINKERBALLA: I don't want that
disaster porn on the forums.


967
0:25:45,61 --> 0:25:47,14
Some of us have sensitive
stomachs.


968
0:25:47,14 --> 0:25:47,93
ZABOO: Don't worry, Codex.


969
0:25:47,93 --> 0:25:50,24
I'll create a separate forum
topic for you to post pictures


970
0:25:50,24 --> 0:25:51,95
and videos for those of us,
you know, who want to


971
0:25:51,95 --> 0:25:53,22
celebrate your love.


972
0:25:53,22 --> 0:25:55,13
Also, I've been doing my friend
research, and have


973
0:25:55,13 --> 0:25:57,27
learned how to braid hair in
eight different styles.


974
0:25:57,27 --> 0:25:59,25
Mostly from Hairly
Legal magazine.


975
0:25:59,25 --> 0:25:59,87
CODEX: No, no, no, no, no--


976
0:25:59,87 --> 0:26:0,62
Tink is right.


977
0:26:0,62 --> 0:26:3,5
From now on, I'll keep my
relationship with Fawkes on


978
0:26:3,5 --> 0:26:4,19
the down low.


979
0:26:4,19 --> 0:26:5,0
For the good of the guild.


980
0:26:5,0 --> 0:26:6,36
No matter how it's going.


981
0:26:6,36 --> 0:26:6,7
Ooh--


982
0:26:6,7 --> 0:26:7,46
BLADEZZ: Move.


983
0:26:7,46 --> 0:26:9,38
I have to keep up with
guild hall farming.


984
0:26:9,38 --> 0:26:10,5
CODEX: Don't be mad at me.


985
0:26:10,5 --> 0:26:11,73
I can't help it if Ollie
gave me a job


986
0:26:11,73 --> 0:26:12,58
that's better than yours.


987
0:26:12,58 --> 0:26:13,61
BLADEZZ: Hey, I'm the rogue.


988
0:26:13,61 --> 0:26:15,24
I'm supposed to do the
backstabbing here.


989
0:26:15,24 --> 0:26:16,62
CODEX: A lot of the bad
internet comments are


990
0:26:16,62 --> 0:26:18,3
specifically about you.


991
0:26:18,3 --> 0:26:19,99
Horrible food, cooked
by sleepy-looking


992
0:26:19,99 --> 0:26:20,84
feather-haired kid?


993
0:26:20,84 --> 0:26:23,3
BLADEZZ: They're called
layers, hater.


994
0:26:23,3 --> 0:26:26,41
You guys can weep, but as I'm
up to 25K on guild hall


995
0:26:26,41 --> 0:26:29,48
farming, prepare for bloody
axes and iron maidens.


996
0:26:29,48 --> 0:26:30,73
TINKERBALLA: Correction.


997
0:26:30,73 --> 0:26:32,39
Fairy and unicorn tapestries.


998
0:26:32,39 --> 0:26:35,45
Clara, check our numbers.


999
0:26:35,45 --> 0:26:37,64
CLARA: Tink and I are
up 60 K. Eat it--


1000
0:26:37,64 --> 0:26:38,73
VORK: 60 K?


1001
0:26:38,73 --> 0:26:41,18
I've been practicing classic
Keynesian economics and I'm


1002
0:26:41,18 --> 0:26:42,41
only up to 27.


1003

need to vacuum seal them?

1497
0:40:13,52 --> 0:40:15,42
Because that is my specialty.

selling in-game products, but

are too thin.

That was the deal.

FAWKES: Well, I've never had
the experience of being a


1513
0:40:41,52 --> 0:40:43,91

this would be a good

0:40:53,53 --> 0:40:54,96
This is a second date.

myself, if you were to role


1526
0:41:3,72 --> 0:41:4,84
play yourself?


1527
0:41:4,84 --> 0:41:7,35
Then it would be the first time
for role playing us to do


1528
0:41:7,35 --> 0:41:9,28
it on a fainting couch.


1529
0:41:9,28 --> 0:41:9,99

1530
0:41:9,99 --> 0:41:12,92
Thanks for playing along, but,
as of tomorrow, I'm telling

the guild that we are officially
broken up.


1532

fake relationship with the


1533
0:41:18,28 --> 0:41:19,82
pretend me.


1534
0:41:19,82 --> 0:41:20,97
Hm.


1535
0:41:20,97 --> 0:41:23,25
This is indeed a meta
meta moment.


1536
0:41:23,25 --> 0:41:24,82
CODEX: I guess.

0:41:24,82 --> 0:41:26,48
It was barely fun while
it didn't last.

0:41:27,73 --> 0:41:36,91



1540
0:41:36,91 --> 0:41:39,595
It's just a little reminder
of what you're passing up.

breeze in here?

One of the most common types of
romance novels is about the

with anything that


1546
0:41:53,66 --> 0:41:55,985
moves, until he meets the one
right girl who makes him hang


1547
0:41:55,985 --> 0:41:57,82
up his man parts to
settle down for a

0:41:57,82 --> 0:41:59,47
long, one-lady life.

0:41:59,47 --> 0:42:1,63
She usually ends up pregnant
in the epilogue.


1550
0:42:1,63 --> 0:42:3,75
Thank God I called it off
with Fawkes before that.


1551
0:42:3,75 --> 0:42:5,91
Now, I just have to make up a
good story to tell the guild


1552
0:42:5,91 --> 0:42:8,13
about our equitable parting,
and I can close the book on


1553
0:42:8,13 --> 0:42:9,48
the whole thing.

0:42:9,48 --> 0:42:11,21
Meanwhile, I'm filming that
commercial with Bladezz


1555
0:42:11,21 --> 0:42:12,45

learn how to make

1557
0:42:14,72 --> 0:42:17,8
I just looked at my wrist, and
I'm not wearing a watch.


1558
0:42:17,8 --> 0:42:21,45
So dumb.


1559
0:42:21,45 --> 0:42:23,155
Yeah, pregnant gamer tees
are a great idea.


1560
0:42:23,155 --> 0:42:25,0
I don't know why people
wouldn't be into them.

CLARA: We went to, like, four
game stores wearing


1562
0:42:26,57 --> 0:42:29,64

we were a reality show prank.

wanted us to pose for his

Nice website.

0:42:39,21 --> 0:42:40,33
TINKERBALLA: Hey, what's
up with Vork?


1570
0:42:40,33 --> 0:42:42,26
He created a password-protected
channel,


1571
0:42:42,26 --> 0:42:44,47
and he's been in there with
strangers all day.

1:15:33,92 --> 1:15:37,546
BLADEZZ: I wanna vomit, but
it would match the decor.


2743
1:15:37,546 --> 1:15:39,22
KEVINATOR: Anyone ever tell you
your character looks like


2744
1:15:39,22 --> 1:15:42,11
that cheesy pirate dude?


2745
1:15:42,11 --> 1:15:43,23
BLADEZZ: Look like that dude?


2746
1:15:43,23 --> 1:15:44,925
Buddy, I am that dude.


2747
1:15:44,925 --> 1:15:45,61
KEVINATOR: No way.


2748
1:15:45,61 --> 1:15:47,26
Say "taste my pirate patty."


2749
1:15:47,26 --> 1:15:48,685
BLADEZZ: Ahem--


2750
1:15:48,685 --> 1:15:50,56
taste my pirate patty.


2751
1:15:50,56 --> 1:15:51,2
KEVINATOR: Dude!


2752
1:15:51,2 --> 1:15:52,69
You're the dude!


2753
1:15:52,69 --> 1:15:53,94
Walk with me?


2754
1:15:53,94 --> 1:15:58,19



2755
1:15:58,19 --> 1:15:59,68
CODEX: That was close.


2756
1:15:59,68 --> 1:16:0,9
Good job.


2757
1:16:0,9 --> 1:16:1,56
ZABOO: Thanks, best friend.


2758
1:16:1,56 --> 1:16:3,46
Being nice to my mom was
a trippy experience.


2759
1:16:3,46 --> 1:16:6,92
Kinda like that movie Psycho,
but with a happy ending.


2760
1:16:6,92 --> 1:16:7,195
Hey.


2761
1:16:7,195 --> 1:16:10,96
You forward slash
hand-holded me.


2762
1:16:10,96 --> 1:16:12,28
CODEX: Ah, I was just-- eh--


2763
1:16:12,28 --> 1:16:13,84
trying it out.


2764
1:16:13,84 --> 1:16:15,94
BLADEZZ: Man, Kevinator is all
over me about being the


2765
1:16:15,94 --> 1:16:16,84
Cheesybeards dude.


2766
1:16:16,84 --> 1:16:17,34
CODEX: We know.


2767
1:16:17,34 --> 1:16:18,62
You're insufferable.


2768
1:16:18,62 --> 1:16:20,9
BLADEZZ: But he wants me to come
to the gaming convention.


2769
1:16:20,9 --> 1:16:22,32
Make me a guest.


2770
1:16:22,32 --> 1:16:25,9
And I hooked us all
up with tickets.


2771
1:16:25,9 --> 1:16:28,42
You guys can be my manservant
entourage.


2772
1:16:28,42 --> 1:16:29,95
CLARA: A gaming convention?


2773
1:16:29,95 --> 1:16:31,13
CODEX: There's gonna
be a convention?


2774
1:16:31,13 --> 1:16:31,9
With the game?


2775
1:16:31,9 --> 1:16:33,2
VORK: Where did my grief go?


2776
1:16:33,2 --> 1:16:34,46
ZABOO: There's seriously
a convention?


2777
1:16:34,46 --> 1:16:35,768
CLARA: We're going
to a convention--


2778
1:16:35,768 --> 1:16:37,38
MR. WIGGLY: Yeah, honey,
about that--


2779
1:16:37,38 --> 1:16:37,68
CLARA: Wooooo--


2780
1:16:37,68 --> 1:18:37,68
