###0 You know, if we're going to talk about trips that we've taken, you know, when I was a candidate
###6 for office, first trip I took was to visit our troops.
###11 And when I went to Israel as a candidate, I didn't take donors, I didn't attend fundraisers,
###18 I went to Yad Vashem, the — the Holocaust museum there, to remind myself the — the
###25 nature of evil and why our bond with Israel will be unbreakable.
###31 And then I went down to the border towns of Sderot, which had experienced missiles raining
###36 down from Hamas. And I saw families there who showed me where missiles had come down
###43 near their children's bedrooms, and I was reminded of — of what that would mean if
###48 those were my kids, which is why, as president, we funded an Iron Dome program to stop those
###54 missiles.
###55 So that's how I've used my travels when I travel to Israel and when I travel to the
###61 region.
###63 And the central question at this point is going to be, who's going to be credible to
###71 all parties involved?
###73 And they can look at my track record — whether it's Iran sanctions, whether it's dealing
###77 with counterterrorism, whether it's supporting democracy, whether it's supporting women's
###82 rights, whether it's supporting religious minorities — and they can say that the president
###87 of the United States and the United States of America has stood on the right side of
###91 history. And — and that kind of credibility is precisely why we've been able to show leadership
###98 on a wide range of issues facing the world right now.
