2
0:0:0,16 --> 0:0:1,4
STEVE SPANGLER: So today's
questions.


3
0:0:1,4 --> 0:0:4,4
Who likes a lot of these lights
and these lights here


4
0:0:4,4 --> 0:0:7,11
and some batteries and this
thing and some electrical tape


5
0:0:7,11 --> 0:0:9,43
and a whole thing of super
strong magnets?


6
0:0:9,43 --> 0:0:10,25
Who?


7
0:0:10,25 --> 0:0:12,5
This guy.


8
0:0:12,5 --> 0:0:15,13
I'm Steve Spangler and I'm all
about making science fun.


9
0:0:15,13 --> 0:0:18,15
For the last 20 years, I've
been teaching ways to turn


10
0:0:18,15 --> 0:0:21,16
ordinary science experiments
into unforgettable learning


11
0:0:21,16 --> 0:0:22,17
experiences.


12
0:0:22,17 --> 0:0:24,81
I have an amazing team who will
do whatever it takes to


13
0:0:24,81 --> 0:0:27,54
affect the way people
think about science.


14
0:0:27,54 --> 0:0:31,25
And to do that I live by one
motto, make it big, do it


15
0:0:31,25 --> 0:0:32,855
right, give it class.


16
0:0:32,855 --> 0:0:38,26



17
0:0:38,26 --> 0:0:40,81
As a kid you probably had a
whole bunch of these Christmas


18
0:0:40,81 --> 0:0:43,5
lights, you know the strand
that breaks, and somebody


19
0:0:43,5 --> 0:0:44,91
throws them away and you
figured this out.


20
0:0:44,91 --> 0:0:46,58
You figured that you could take
a pair of scissors-- no,


21
0:0:46,58 --> 0:0:48,23
not while it's plugged in--
you could take a pair of


22
0:0:48,23 --> 0:0:51,21
scissors, cut it, strip the
ends off and get something


23
0:0:51,21 --> 0:0:53,11
that looks like this.


24
0:0:53,11 --> 0:0:56,89
This now, was perfect to be able
to learn how to use and


25
0:0:56,89 --> 0:0:57,82
make circuits.


26
0:0:57,82 --> 0:1:0,36
So you'd find yourself a big
battery, because you needed to


27
0:1:0,36 --> 0:1:2,41
have a good supply
of energy there.


28
0:1:2,41 --> 0:1:4,69
Because you never wanted
to hook up just one.


29
0:1:4,69 --> 0:1:5,55
You'd want to hook
up multiples.


30
0:1:5,55 --> 0:1:6,94
So you'd hang onto this one.


31
0:1:6,94 --> 0:1:9,65
And this one would hook up
and use alligator clips.


32
0:1:9,65 --> 0:1:13,29
And, low and behold, if you
completed the circuit, it


33
0:1:13,29 --> 0:1:14,54
looked like this.


34
0:1:14,54 --> 0:1:17,44
You see, as a kid, I
was easily amused.


35
0:1:17,44 --> 0:1:19,6
You could do parallel circuit
and series circuits and


36
0:1:19,6 --> 0:1:24,12
switches and whatever else you
wanted to but, in short order,


37
0:1:24,12 --> 0:1:28,42
LEDs gave way to all of
this material here.


38
0:1:28,42 --> 0:1:31,82
And this, was the new battery
and bulbs unit.


39
0:1:31,82 --> 0:1:33,95
LEDs, light emitting diodes.


40
0:1:33,95 --> 0:1:36,1
They come in all these different
sizes and shapes and


41
0:1:36,1 --> 0:1:38,51
colors, and they run off such
a small amount of energy.


42
0:1:38,51 --> 0:1:41,62
This is a watch battery, so
instead of that huge one we


43
0:1:41,62 --> 0:1:44,74
had before, now you just have
this small little battery.


44
0:1:44,74 --> 0:1:48,1
In this state here, this will
last 30, maybe 40 days


45
0:1:48,1 --> 0:1:52,55
constantly on, and this is the
basis of today's project.


46
0:1:52,55 --> 0:1:54,95
It's amazing what you
can find online.


47
0:1:54,95 --> 0:1:56,6
I want to show you how
to make a throwie.


48
0:1:56,6 --> 0:2:0,19
A throwie is a device that was
invented back in 2005, by


49
0:2:0,19 --> 0:2:2,2
Graffiti Research Lab.


50
0:2:2,2 --> 0:2:6,51
The idea was this-- what if
you could make light in a


51
0:2:6,51 --> 0:2:10,6
device that you could throw and
have it stick to a metal


52
0:2:10,6 --> 0:2:14,13
object and literally, graffiti
the side of a bridge or a


53
0:2:14,13 --> 0:2:17,26
building, something like that,
using light as a graffiti


54
0:2:17,26 --> 0:2:18,84
source instead of
a can of paint.


55
0:2:18,84 --> 0:2:20,94
And that's exactly what
a throwie is.


56
0:2:20,94 --> 0:2:22,91
Still don't understand what
we're talking about?


57
0:2:22,91 --> 0:2:25,308
Take a look at this video from
Graffiti Research Lab.


58
0:2:25,308 --> 0:3:0,87
[MUSIC PLAYING]


59
0:3:0,87 --> 0:3:2,69
Here's what you're going
to need, some LEDs.


60
0:3:2,69 --> 0:3:5,2
Now, LEDS come in all
shapes and sizes.


61
0:3:5,2 --> 0:3:6,8
These are 10 millimeter LEDs.


62
0:3:6,8 --> 0:3:10,7
They're super bright and
they're probably--


63
0:3:10,7 --> 0:3:10,9
I don't know--


64
0:3:10,9 --> 0:3:13,39
$0.20, $0.30 cents apiece if
you're buying a bag of 100 of


65
0:3:13,39 --> 0:3:14,84
them, in bulk, online.


66
0:3:14,84 --> 0:3:16,7
To power them you're going to
need to have these watch


67
0:3:16,7 --> 0:3:17,57
batteries here.


68
0:3:17,57 --> 0:3:20,7
These are CR 2032s,
very, very common.


69
0:3:20,7 --> 0:3:21,77
It's a three volt battery.


70
0:3:21,77 --> 0:3:24,58
Again, in quantity, maybe
$0.30, $0.40.


71
0:3:24,58 --> 0:3:26,15
You're going to need to have
some electrical tape.


72
0:3:26,15 --> 0:3:28,8
And finally, neodymium
magnets, so


73
0:3:28,8 --> 0:3:29,9
super strong magnets.


74
0:3:29,9 --> 0:3:31,71
And that's what's going
to hold it in place.


75
0:3:31,71 --> 0:3:34,446
So let's start by making a red
LED throwie and you're going


76
0:3:34,446 --> 0:3:35,64
to start with the LED.


77
0:3:35,64 --> 0:3:38,92
Now, these are 10 millimeter
super brights.


78
0:3:38,92 --> 0:3:42,33
And you're going to open up the
little ends like this, so


79
0:3:42,33 --> 0:3:44,49
that you can take the watch
battery and kind of put it


80
0:3:44,49 --> 0:3:45,24
right in between.


81
0:3:45,24 --> 0:3:48,15
No extra wires needed, just hold
it in place and it works.


82
0:3:48,15 --> 0:3:50,79
If for some reason it doesn't
work, it just means that you


83
0:3:50,79 --> 0:3:53,17
have the LED probably
reversed.


84
0:3:53,17 --> 0:3:55,4
So if you put in place and it
doesn't work, it doesn't mean


85
0:3:55,4 --> 0:3:56,9
the battery is bad or
the LED is bad.


86
0:3:56,9 --> 0:3:59,8
Try just reversing it since this
is polarity sensitive,


87
0:3:59,8 --> 0:4:2,1
meaning plus goes to plus
and minus goes to minus.


88
0:4:2,1 --> 0:4:3,29
And it's ready to go.


89
0:4:3,29 --> 0:4:5,54
It's just a simple
little diode.


90
0:4:5,54 --> 0:4:7,33
It starts with a piece
of electrical tape.


91
0:4:7,33 --> 0:4:10,32
If you pull off a piece of the
tape, you can now make the


92
0:4:10,32 --> 0:4:12,22
throwie like this.


93
0:4:12,22 --> 0:4:16,1
And you want to just tape the
leads in place around the


94
0:4:16,1 --> 0:4:22,14
battery so it's making constant
contact and this, is


95
0:4:22,14 --> 0:4:23,21
a simple circuit.


96
0:4:23,21 --> 0:4:24,96
Now, I guess it could
be tossed around.


97
0:4:24,96 --> 0:4:26,3
You could do something
with it.


98
0:4:26,3 --> 0:4:29,82
But it's not sticky and that's
where the magnet comes in.


99
0:4:29,82 --> 0:4:33,11
Well, to turn the LED and the
watch battery into a throwie,


100
0:4:33,11 --> 0:4:35,74
you're going to need to have a
super strong neodymium magnet.


101
0:4:35,74 --> 0:4:38,41
Now, these little guys have
become expensive over the last


102
0:4:38,41 --> 0:4:40,62
year and a half or two years,
so that's the most expensive


103
0:4:40,62 --> 0:4:42,86
part of the project, but you
really do need these small


104
0:4:42,86 --> 0:4:45,9
little neodymium magnets.


105
0:4:45,9 --> 0:4:46,18
Here's how it works.


106
0:4:46,18 --> 0:4:49,93
We use the watch battery to
complete the circuit here with


107
0:4:49,93 --> 0:4:54,45
the LED and then, we put the
magnet right on the lead so it


108
0:4:54,45 --> 0:4:56,38
literally, holds it in place.


109
0:4:56,38 --> 0:4:58,4
Now, this whole thing gets
wrapped with the electrical


110
0:4:58,4 --> 0:5:2,6
tape and you have yourself
a throwie.


111
0:5:2,6 --> 0:5:4,12
We have everything in place
now we just need to have


112
0:5:4,12 --> 0:5:5,56
something metal.


113
0:5:5,56 --> 0:5:8,95
That's where the trash can
lid comes into place.


114
0:5:8,95 --> 0:5:10,31
And that's what you
call a throwie.


115
0:5:10,31 --> 0:5:12,14
Now, you just need more.


116
0:5:12,14 --> 0:5:17,49
What a perfect way to be able
to combine science and art.


117
0:5:17,49 --> 0:5:21,75
What if you had a throwie that
you could turn on and off


118
0:5:21,75 --> 0:5:23,34
using this little plastic tab?


119
0:5:23,34 --> 0:5:24,84
It's easy to make.


120
0:5:24,84 --> 0:5:26,79
Higginsworth actually
came up with this.


121
0:5:26,79 --> 0:5:29,61
This is a little plastic
tab here that you


122
0:5:29,61 --> 0:5:30,72
just pull in and out.


123
0:5:30,72 --> 0:5:32,92
And it's made out of this
little plastic here.


124
0:5:32,92 --> 0:5:35,75
So we just took a piece of
recycled packaging material,


125
0:5:35,75 --> 0:5:36,7
cut it up in there.


126
0:5:36,7 --> 0:5:37,38
It was perfect.


127
0:5:37,38 --> 0:5:40,22
And this electrical tape that
you see here, has another


128
0:5:40,22 --> 0:5:43,41
piece of electrical tape here
that won't stick to this, so


129
0:5:43,41 --> 0:5:45,88
that it's easy to be able
to slide it in and out.


130
0:5:45,88 --> 0:5:48,11
Wrap the electrical tape around,
put it on the magnet


131
0:5:48,11 --> 0:5:51,4
side, and watch this as you
pull, it lights up.


132
0:5:51,4 --> 0:5:53,5
When you're done playing
with it you are


133
0:5:53,5 --> 0:5:55,24
back as you were before.


134
0:5:55,24 --> 0:5:58,91
So let's say you're making a
throwie, you've got your LEDs.


135
0:5:58,91 --> 0:5:59,78
You've got the battery.


136
0:5:59,78 --> 0:6:2,225
You've got your electrical
tape.


137
0:6:2,225 --> 0:6:4,75
The only thing you're missing
is, of course, those super


138
0:6:4,75 --> 0:6:7,44
expensive neodymium magnets.


139
0:6:7,44 --> 0:6:9,21
Is there another way to get
it to stick to something?


140
0:6:9,21 --> 0:6:11,86
Well, how about Velcro?


141
0:6:11,86 --> 0:6:14,56
So we just went out and bought
some of the sticky back Velcro


142
0:6:14,56 --> 0:6:17,8
and cut the Velcro so that
you put, for example,


143
0:6:17,8 --> 0:6:19,14
the hook side here.


144
0:6:19,14 --> 0:6:22,47
And now, it's easy to be able to
throw it onto the loop side


145
0:6:22,47 --> 0:6:23,76
and it sticks perfectly.


146
0:6:23,76 --> 0:6:26,23
Which got me to thinking, what
if you could make an entire


147
0:6:26,23 --> 0:6:28,99
suit, a jumpsuit,
out of Velcro?


148
0:6:28,99 --> 0:6:33,47
And you had, oh, I say, 150 or
so friends that would throw


149
0:6:33,47 --> 0:6:36,93
throwies on that jumpsuit.


150
0:6:36,93 --> 0:6:39,1
Take a look at this.


151
0:6:39,1 --> 0:6:41,2
Well, you know how to make a
throwie using the Velcro.


152
0:6:41,2 --> 0:6:44,13
The only thing you need now is
something to throw the Velcro


153
0:6:44,13 --> 0:6:46,63
to and that's where Higginsworth
comes in.


154
0:6:46,63 --> 0:6:49,61
Higginsworth, you have the
Velcro and it's the other side


155
0:6:49,61 --> 0:6:51,81
and it sticks.


156
0:6:51,81 --> 0:6:52,195
It's perfect.


157
0:6:52,195 --> 0:6:53,445
But that's not very fun.


158
0:6:53,445 --> 0:6:56,702
It would be fun if there are
hundreds of them like this.


159
0:6:56,702 --> 0:7:5,134



160
0:7:5,134 --> 0:7:6,622
Now, that's cool.


161
0:7:6,622 --> 0:7:25,47



162
0:7:25,47 --> 0:7:27,82
Now, I have three Velcro people


163
0:7:27,82 --> 0:7:29,11
and hundreds of friends.


164
0:7:29,11 --> 0:7:30,33
Watch this.


165
0:7:30,33 --> 0:7:31,58
Go!


166
0:7:31,58 --> 0:8:13,244



167
0:8:13,244 --> 0:8:15,24
Let's here it for
Velcro, people!


168
0:8:15,24 --> 0:8:52,1



169
0:8:52,1 --> 0:8:53,6
HIGGINSWORTH: What kind of ice
cream do we get to try?


170
0:8:53,6 --> 0:8:55,4
FEMALE SPEAKER: Caramel cone,
cookies and cream, mango


171
0:8:55,4 --> 0:8:56,65
sorbet and Belgian chocolate.


172
0:8:56,65 --> 0:10:56,65
