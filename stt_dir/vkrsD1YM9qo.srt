FROM A SENATOR SO SOMEONE IN THE COMMUNITY

PROVIDED THAT SENATOR BOXER THIS STATEMENT
SHE SAYS WE HAVE RECEIVED THE LETTER FROM


3
0:0:7,359 --> 0:0:11,69
SENATOR BOXER AND CONGRESSMAN MARKY WHO WILL
RESPOND IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS AS


4
0:0:11,69 --> 0:0:14,589
AN INDEPENDENT SAFETY AGENCY.
WE WILL REVIEW ALL AVAILABLE INFORMATION IN


5
0:0:14,589 --> 0:0:19,79
MAKING A JUDGMENT AS TO WHETHER THE PLANT
WOULD MEET SAFETY STANDARDS IF RESTART WERE


6
0:0:19,79 --> 0:0:22,95
PERMITTED.
WHAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE THE NRC DO?


7
0:0:22,95 --> 0:0:28,83
>> >>GUEST SPEAKER: I DON'T THINK EDISON'S
BEEN OPEN AND HONEST WITH THE NRC OR WITH


8
0:0:28,83 --> 0:0:35,98
THE PEOPLE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.
SO IT'S HARD TO LET A PLANT RUN WHEN THE OWNER


9
0:0:35,98 --> 0:0:55,9
OF THE PLANT HASN'T BEEN OPEN AND HONEST.

11
0:1:8,74 --> 0:1:16,39
IN MEXICO SAYS THE PROBLEM APPEARS TO BE IMPROVING.
THE STUDY COMES FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF SAN

FRONTERAS REPORTER ADRIAN FLORIDO JOINS US


13
0:1:19,979 --> 0:1:23,49
FROM THE NEWS CENTER.
HOW BIG OF A DECLINE ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?


14
0:1:23,49 --> 0:1:31,409
>> >>GUEST SPEAKER: WELL, AT THE END OF 2011,
THE REPORT THAT THE USD PUTS OUT EVERY YEAR


15
0:1:31,409 --> 0:1:37,479
SAID THAT DRUG VILE NS WAS STILL INCREASING
IN MEXICO, BUT IT SEEMS TO BE LEVELING OFF.


16
0:1:37,479 --> 0:1:41,92
IT WAS INCREASING AT A SLOWER RATE THAN IT
HAD AT YEARS PAST.


17
0:1:41,92 --> 0:1:46,93
THIS YEAR THEY'RE SAYING IT MIGHT HAVE DECREASED
IN 2011 THERE WERE 27,000 HOMICIDES IN MEXICO.


18
0:1:46,93 --> 0:1:50,89
THIS LAST YEAR THERE WERE ESTIMATED TO BE
ABOUT 20 TO 25,000 NATIONALLY.


19
0:1:50,89 --> 0:1:53,859
>> >>DWANE: DO WE KNOW HOW MANY OF THOSE WERE
DRUG RELATED MURDERS?


20
0:1:53,859 --> 0:1:58,509
>> >>GUEST SPEAKER: IT'S ALWAYS KIND OF TRICKY
TO TELL BECAUSE IT'S DIFFICULT DATA TO COLLECT.


21
0:1:58,509 --> 0:2:3,29
IT WAS ESPECIALLY TRICKY FOR THE RESEARCH
INSTITUTE THIS YEAR BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T ABLE


22
0:2:3,29 --> 0:2:8,909
TO GET DATA FROM THE MEXICAN GOVERNMENT.
BASED ON SCOURING OF NEWS REPORTS ON TALLIES


23
0:2:8,909 --> 0:2:13,98
THAT THE NATION'S LARGEST NEWSPAPERS KEEP,
THEY ESTIMATED THAT BETWEEN 25 AND 50% OF

FLORIDO.
AT LEAST 30 PEOPLE HAVE DIED FROM THE FLU


26
0:2:22,33 --> 0:2:28,56
IN SAN DIEGO SINCE NOVEMBER. THE YOUNGEST
WAS 42 AND THE OLDEST PERSON WAS NOIFNLT ALL


27
0:2:28,56 --> 0:2:34,77
BUT ONE OF THOSE PATIENTS HAD UNDERLYING HEALTH
PROBLEMS. THE AGENCY HAS CONFIRMED 3,000 CASES


28
0:2:34,77 --> 0:2:40,44
OF THE FLU THIS SEASON BUT SAYS THE NUMBER
IS LOW BECAUSE MANY CASES AREN'T RECORDED.


29
0:2:40,44 --> 0:2:49,78
THERE'S STILL TIME TO GET A FLU SHOT. TO FIND
A LOCATION NEAR YOU CALL 211 OR VISIT SDIZ.ORG.


30
0:2:49,78 --> 0:2:55,42
WE HAVE AN UPDATE ON A STORY WE'VE BEEN FOLLOWING
FOR QUITE SOME TIME HERE AT KPBS.


31
0:2:55,42 --> 0:3:1,849
RESEARCHERS HAVE DISCOVERED THE FIRST U.S.
CASES OF WHOOPING COUGH THAT MAY BE IMMUNE


32
0:3:1,849 --> 0:3:4,87
TO THE VACCINE.
MOST OF THE FOLKS WHO GOT SICK WERE ALREADY


33
0:3:4,87 --> 0:3:6,97
IMMUNIZED.
SCIENTISTS DON'T BELIEVE THE NEW STRAIN IS


34
0:3:6,97 --> 0:3:12,87
MORE DEADLY BUT SUSPECT THE NEW VACCINE MAY
NOT FIGHT AGAINST IT. THE NEW BUG HAS BEEN


35
0:3:12,87 --> 0:3:18,25
IDENTIFIED IN JAPAN, FINLAND AND FRANCE.
BOB FILNER WANTS THE NUCLEAR TOIR REGULATORY

SHE SPOKE WITH THE MAYOR ABOUT SAN ONOFRE


38
0:3:26,22 --> 0:3:31,4
INCLUDING A RANGE OF OTHER TOPICS.
>> >>AMITA: MAYOR BOB FILNER, WELCOME TO THE


39
0:3:31,4 --> 0:3:36,36
PROGRAM.
THE BIG NEWS THIS WEEK IS THE JUDGE THROWING


40
0:3:36,36 --> 0:3:42,989
OUT IRWIN JACOBS REMODELING PLAN FOR PLAZA
DE PANAMA ON GROUNDS THAT IT VIOLATED CITY


41
0:3:42,989 --> 0:3:47,58
CODE.
HOW DOES A PLAN LIKE THIS GET PAST THE CITY


42
0:3:47,58 --> 0:3:52,85
ATTORNEYS OFFICE, PAST THE CITY COUNCIL WITHOUT
ANYONE SEEING IT VIOLATED CITY LAW.


43
0:3:52,85 --> 0:3:56,69
>> >>GUEST SPEAKER: I THINK THEY WERE TOLD
THAT.


44
0:3:56,69 --> 0:4:3,54
I TOLD THEM THAT AT A CITY COUNCIL MEETING,
THEY CHOSE NOT TO LISTEN.


45
0:4:3,54 --> 0:4:9,4
THEY THOUGHT THEY COULD BULLY THEIR WAY THROUGH
THE WHOLE SYSTEM.


46
0:4:9,4 --> 0:4:12,18
WE APPRECIATE DR.ÊJACOBS PHILANTHROPY AND
WILLINGNESS TO HELP.


47
0:4:12,18 --> 0:4:19,39
WE ALSO AGREE WITH THE END RESULT THAT IS
TO GET THE CARS OUT OF BALBOA PARK.


48
0:4:19,39 --> 0:4:24,439
I THINK THAT CAN BE DONE NOW AT A MUCH CHEAPER,
LESS LOWER TECHNOLOGY WAY THAT WILL PRESERVE


49
0:4:24,439 --> 0:4:28,289
BOTH THE TOPOLOGY AND GEOGRAPHY OF THE PARK,
BUT KEEP CARS OUT.


50
0:4:28,289 --> 0:4:33,83
WE HAVE AÊ I WROTE A PLAN 20 YEARS WHEN I
WAS ON THE CITY COUNCIL TO PARK CARS IN THE


51
0:4:33,83 --> 0:4:37,619
PERIMETER OF BALBOA PARK, PARKING STRUCTURE
OUTSIDE, AND THEN USE A TRAM SYSTEM TO GET


52
0:4:37,619 --> 0:4:42,499
PEOPLE INTO THE PARK.
THAT TRAM SYSTEM BECOMES PART OF THE EXPERIENCE


53
0:4:42,499 --> 0:4:46,229
OF BALBOA PARK.
>> >>AMITA: DO YOU EXPECT SOMETHING LIKE THAT


54
0:4:46,229 --> 0:4:49,589
TO HAPPEN BEFORE THE CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION
IN 2015?


55
0:4:49,589 --> 0:4:52,629
>> >>GUEST SPEAKER: I DO, BECAUSE THE CENTENNIAL
CELEBRATION WOULD HAVE REQUIRED SOMETHING


56
0:4:52,629 --> 0:4:55,18
LIKE THAT ANYWAY BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE
TO KEEP CARS OUT.


57
0:4:55,18 --> 0:5:6,649
SO WE WOULD HAVE HAD TO DO THIS IN ANY CASE.
SO LET'S START NOWVMENT SHOW THAT IT WORKS


58
0:5:6,649 --> 0:5:10,569
AND BUILD FROM THERE.
>> >>DWANE2: ON THE TOPIC OF ALLOWING MEDICAL


59
0:5:10,569 --> 0:5:15,419
MARIJUANA DISPENSARIES TO OPERATE WITHIN THIS
CITY, YOU'RE WORKING ON AN ORDINANCE YOU SAY


60
0:5:15,419 --> 0:5:20,159
IS SIMILAR TO ONE THAT WAS ADOPTED BY THE
CITY COUNCIL TWO YEARS AGO.


61
0:5:20,159 --> 0:5:23,489
BUT THAT WAS SUCCESSFULLY REPEALED.
HOW DO YOU MAKE SURE THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN?


62
0:5:23,489 --> 0:5:29,409
>> >>GUEST SPEAKER: THIS IS A BALANCE WE HAVE
TO TRY TO STRIKE I'M GOING TO ATTEMPT TO DO


63
0:5:29,409 --> 0:5:31,169
WITHIN ABOUT THREE OR FOUR WEEKS.
THAT IS ON THE ONE HAND THE STATE REFERENDUM


64
0:5:31,169 --> 0:5:34,18
AND HUMANITARIAN CONCERNS REQUIRE WE PROVIDE
ACCESS TO MEDICAL MARIJUANA TO PEOPLE WHO


65
0:5:34,18 --> 0:5:36,5
NEED IT, WHO HAVE CANCER A DOCTOR'S PRESCRIPTION,
IN CHRONIC PAIN.


66
0:5:36,5 --> 0:5:39,68
ON THE OTHER HAND, WE DON'T WANT NEIGHBORHOODS
TO BE INTRUDED ON, CHILDREN TO HAVE ACCESS


67
0:5:39,68 --> 0:5:44,29
TO MARIJUANA, AND WE HAVE TO RESTRICT IT TO
THOSE WHO NEED MEDICAL MARIJUANA.


68
0:5:44,29 --> 0:5:49,949
THAT'S A BALANCING ACT THAT'S HANDLED PARTIALLY
THROUGH ZONEING AND THE CITY COUNCIL PREVIOUSLY


69
0:5:49,949 --> 0:5:54,159
I THINK WAS TOO RESTRICTIVE.
I THINK IF WE RESTRICT TO INDUSTRIAL AND COMMERCIAL


70
0:5:54,159 --> 0:6:0,179
ZONES, FOR EXAMPLE, IF WE HAVE A PERM TT FEE
THAT IS REAL THAT WOULD JUST KEEP FLY BY NIGHT


71
0:6:0,179 --> 0:6:3,77
PEOPLE OUT THAT WE HAVE STRICT REQUIREMENTS
ABOUT DISTANCES FROM SCHOOLS AND CHURCHES,


72
0:6:3,77 --> 0:6:6,8
FOR EXAMPLE, WE COULD HAVE THE BALANCE THAT
WE NEED.


73
0:6:6,8 --> 0:6:12,999
WE'RE GOING TO TRY TO STRIKE THAT BALANCE.
IT'S NOT EASY BUT WE WILL TRY TO DO THAT.


74
0:6:12,999 --> 0:6:16,83
>> >>AMITA: SEVERAL PROMINENT DEVELOPERS AND
OTHER SUPPORTERS OF CARL DEMAIO'S IN THE NOVEMBER


75
0:6:16,83 --> 0:6:19,49
ELECTION ARE HELPING TO PAY DOWN YOUR CAMPAIGN
DEBT.


76
0:6:19,49 --> 0:6:24,419
DID YOU SOLICIT THAT MONEY?
>> >>GUEST SPEAKER: WE WERE LEFT WITH IN THE


77
0:6:24,419 --> 0:6:31,909
SCHEME OF THING AS PRETTY LOW AS THESE THINGS
GO, ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS.


78
0:6:31,909 --> 0:6:35,729
WE ASKED OUR PREVIOUS CONTRIBUTORS AND ANYBODY
WHO WANTED TO SUPPORT ME IN MOVING FORWARD


79
0:6:35,729 --> 0:6:39,58
TO BRING DOWN THAT DEBT.
THE CITY LAW REQUIRES ME TO DO THAT WITHIN


80
0:6:39,58 --> 0:6:42,189
SIX MONTHS OR YOU CANNOT RAISE MONEY AFTER
THAT.


81
0:6:42,189 --> 0:6:44,58
I INVITE ANYBODY AND EVERYBODY WHO WANTS TO
CRIB TEUT DO THAT.


82
0:6:44,58 --> 0:6:48,639
EVERYBODY KNOWS FROM MY 30 YEARS IN POLITICS
NOBODY CAN BUY ME WITH A CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTION.


83
0:6:48,639 --> 0:6:53,849
I'M GOING TO BE AN INDEPENDENT NO MATTER WHAT.
I'M NOT EVEN SURE ALWAYS WHO HAS BEEN GIVING


84
0:6:53,849 --> 0:6:57,29
BECAUSE WE PUT A REPORT AFTER SIX MONTHS.
SO EXCUSE MEÊ I INVITE PEOPLE, WE HAVE A


85
0:6:57,29 --> 0:7:1,83
500 DOLLAR LIMIT OB CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS
TO MAYORAL CANDIDATES AND ANYBODY WHO WANTS


86
0:7:1,83 --> 0:7:7,259
TO JOIN IN TO HELPING ME WITH THAT, WE WELCOME.
>> >>AMITA: YOU'VE SPOKEN ABOUT THE NEED FOR


87
0:7:7,259 --> 0:7:10,36
THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO TO PLAN FOR CLIMATE
CHANGE FOR SEA LEVEL RISE.


88
0:7:10,36 --> 0:7:14,429
AND YET, THERE ARE THESE FLOOD PROJECTION
MAPS THAT SHOW THE SAN DIEGO CONVENTION CENTER


89
0:7:14,429 --> 0:7:18,159
EXPANSION UNDER WATER IN 38 YEARS.
HOW CONCERNED ARE YOU ABOUT THOSE MAPS?


90
0:7:18,159 --> 0:7:22,309
>> >>GUEST SPEAKER: I'M VERY CONCERNED.
AS I SAID, DURING THE CAMPAIGN, IF WE WANT


91
0:7:22,309 --> 0:7:26,459
TO PROTECT OUR BEACHES, WE SHOULD GET OUR
HEAD OUT OF THE SAND.


92
0:7:26,459 --> 0:7:31,3
THAT IS, WE HAVE TO TAKE THIS SERIOUSLY.
OBVIOUSLY, INTERNATIONALLY, NATIONALLY, STATE


93
0:7:31,3 --> 0:7:35,55
WIDE, AND LOCALLY.
WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY IN SAN DIEGO TO DO


94
0:7:35,55 --> 0:7:39,169
WHAT RVE WE CAN.
WE CAN'T STOP THE GLACIERS FROM MELTING, BUT


95
0:7:39,169 --> 0:7:43,58
WE CAN TAKE IN OUR ENERGY SITUATIONS, USE
OF OUR WATER, OUR CARBON EMISSIONS, WE CAN


96
0:7:43,58 --> 0:7:46,879
TAKE STEPS HERE.
I'VE ASKED A COUPLE PEOPLE TO CHAIR A COMMITTEE


97
0:7:46,879 --> 0:7:50,809
WHICH WE'LL ANNOUNCE SOON TO COME UP WITH
A VERY STRATEGIC CLIMATE MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR


98
0:7:50,809 --> 0:7:55,29
SAN DIEGO WHICH WILL REQUIRE THINGS LIKE,
YOU KNOW, 0 ENERGY KINDS OF BUILDINGS IN THE


99
0:7:55,29 --> 0:7:57,199
FUTURE.
AND WE HAVE TO CONTRIBUTE WHATEVER WE CAN


100
0:7:57,199 --> 0:7:59,369
TO THIS EFFORT.
>> >>AMITA: AS YOU KNOW, SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA


101
0:7:59,369 --> 0:8:4,699
EDISON WANTS TO REOPEN SAN ONOFRE NUCLEAR
POWER PLANT AT A REDUCED CAPACITY.


102
0:8:4,699 --> 0:8:7,229
SEVERAL CITIES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ARE
PRESSURING FEDERAL REG YRLTS NOT TO LET THAT


103
0:8:7,229 --> 0:8:10,11
HAPPEN UNTIL A TRIAL LIKE PUBLIC HEARING IS
HELD.


104
0:8:10,11 --> 0:8:14,309
IN WHICH EDISON HAS TO PROVE THAT THIS PLANT
IS SAFE TO REOPEN.


105
0:8:14,309 --> 0:8:17,309
WHAT'S YOUR POSITION?
>> >>GUEST SPEAKER: I THINK THAT HEARING IS


106
0:8:17,309 --> 0:8:19,449
CRITICAL AND NECESSARY.
WE DON'T WANT TO BE A FREE MOUND, WE DON'T


107
0:8:19,449 --> 0:8:24,989
WANT TO BE A CHERNOBYL.
WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE A SITUATION AS THEY


108
0:8:24,989 --> 0:8:29,69
HAD IN JAPAN.
I MEAN, THE SAFETY OF NUCLEAR PLANTS IS VERY


109
0:8:29,69 --> 0:8:32,61
SHAKY.
IF THEY'RE ON EARTHQUAKE FAULTS OR NEAR THE


110
0:8:32,61 --> 0:8:38,629
OCEAN AS SAN ONOFRE IS, AND IN THIS CASE WHEN
A STEAM GENERATOR HAS SOME PROBLEMS WITH SOME


111
0:8:38,629 --> 0:8:43,509
OF THE CRITICAL COMPONENTS, AS SOMEONE WHO
HAS TO CARE PRIMARILY ABOUT THE SAFETY OF


112
0:8:43,509 --> 0:8:49,8
OUR CITIZENS, I WILL BE A VOICE FOR SAYING
UNLESS YOU CAN ASSURE US, ALL OF OUR CITIZENS


113
0:8:49,8 --> 0:8:51,75
OF THE SAFETY OF THAT PLANT, WE SHOULD NOT
REOPEN IT.


114
0:8:51,75 --> 0:8:56,69
WE HAVE TO HAVE A HEARING TO DO THAT.
>> >>AMITA: SO FAR THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO HASN'T


115
0:8:56,69 --> 0:9:0,61
TAKE AN FORMAL POSITION ON THIS.
DO YOU WANT TO SEE THAT HAPPEN?


116
0:9:0,61 --> 0:9:3,44
>> >>GUEST SPEAKER: I HAVE AND I WOULD HOPE
IF THE CITY COUNCIL WILL NOT, I WILL SPEAK


117
0:9:3,44 --> 0:9:7,23
AS THE MAYOR AT THOSE HEARINGS AND SAYÊ I
THINK THEIR PLAN FOR RUNNING IT AT A REDUCED


118
0:9:7,23 --> 0:9:13,5
LEVEL TO SEE HOW SAFE IT IS IS VERY IRRESPONSIBLE.
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT NUCLEAR ACCENT.


119
0:9:13,5 --> 0:9:16,18
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO
CAN BE AT RISK.


120
0:9:16,18 --> 0:9:19,37
SO I DON'T WANT TO SEE IT OPEN BEFORE IT'S
PROVEN SAFETY FIRST.


121
0:9:19,37 --> 0:9:22,47
>> >>AMITA: SAN DIEGO MAYOR BOB FILNER, THANK
YOU FOR COMING ON THE PROGRAM.


122
0:9:22,47 --> 0:9:25,519
>> >>GUEST SPEAKER: THANK YOU.
>> >>DWANE: COUNTY SUPERVISORS VOTED FOUR


123
0:9:25,519 --> 0:9:33,209
TO ONE TO APPROVE A SOLAR POWER PLANT IN RAMONA.
THE SOUL OMP RD PROJECT WILL COM COVER 43


124
0:9:33,209 --> 0:9:35,779
ACRES WITH SOLAR PANELS WHERE A DAIRY FARM
IS KURNLTLY LOCATED.


125
0:9:35,779 --> 0:9:38,91
SOME NEIGHBORS SAY THE PLANT WILL BE AN EYE
SORE.


126
0:9:38,91 --> 0:9:42,35
MOSTLY POSITIVE REACTION FROM SAN DIEGANS
WE SPOKE TO ABOUT NEWS THE POSTAL SERVICE


127
0:9:42,35 --> 0:9:45,25
PLANS TO SUSPEND SATURDAY MAIL DELIVERY THIS
SUMMER.


128
0:9:45,25 --> 0:9:49,87
THE PLAN TO SHRINK DELIVERY FROM SIX DAYS
TO FIVE WOULD ONLY AFFECT FIRST CLASS MAIL


129
0:9:49,87 --> 0:9:54,35
BEGINNING IN AUGUST WHILE PACKAGES, MAIL ORDER,
MEDICINES, PRIORITY AND EXPRESS MAIL WOULD


130
0:9:54,35 --> 0:9:57,16
STILL GET DELIVERED ON SATURDAYS.
THE POSTAL SERVICE LOST 16ÊBILLION DOLLARS


131
0:9:57,16 --> 0:10:1,57
LAST YEAR AND THINKS THE MOVE WILL SAVE ABOUT
TWO BILLION A YEAR.


132
0:10:1,57 --> 0:10:5,99
>> >>GUEST SPEAKER: IT'S ABOUT TIME.
IF THEY'RE GOING BANKRUPT THEY'VE GOT TO CUT


133
0:10:5,99 --> 0:10:9,379
THEIR EXPENSES.
ALL THE BUSINESSES HAVE CUT BACK, THEY NEED


134
0:10:9,379 --> 0:10:11,759
TO.
>> >>GUEST SPEAKER: EVERYBODY E MAILS AND


135
0:10:11,759 --> 0:10:15,919
IT'S A CHANGING TIME AND THEN THEY LET EVERYBODY
TAKE THEIR BUSINESS LIKE UPSÊ


136
0:10:15,919 --> 0:10:20,589
>> >>GUEST SPEAKER: MY OPINION IS IT'S A LONG
TIME COMING, IT REALLY IS.


137
0:10:20,589 --> 0:10:28,73
AS FAR AS THE POSTAL ESTABLISHMENT, THEY NEED
TO LET THE GOVERNMENT JUST GET OUT OF IT ALL


138
0:10:28,73 --> 0:10:33,899
TOGETHER AND LET IT BE A COMPANY RUN SO THEY'LL
MAKE THE MONEY THEY NEED TO MAKE AND HAVE


139
0:10:33,899 --> 0:10:35,679
THE GOVERNMENT STAW STOP TAKING THE MONEY
THEY'RE MAKING NOW.


140
0:10:35,679 --> 0:10:39,339
>> >>GUEST SPEAKER: I THINK THERE IS A PLACE
FOR THE POST OFFICE, BUT IT IS A BUSINESS


141
0:10:39,339 --> 0:10:43,779
SO THEY DO NEED TO MAKE THAT DECISION.
I AGREE WITH IT.


142
0:10:43,779 --> 0:10:47,68
>> >>DWANE: AND HERE'S WHAT A LOCAL REPRESENTATIVE
WITH THE POSTAL SERVICE SAID QUOTE THERE IS


143
0:10:47,68 --> 0:10:50,939
NO LONGER SUFFICIENT VOLUME TO SUSTAIN SIX
DAYS OF MAIL DELIVERY.


144
0:10:50,939 --> 0:10:52,67
WE DEVELOPED THIS APPROACH WORKING WITH OUR
CUSTOMERS TO UNDERSTAND THEIR DELIVERY NEEDS


145
0:10:52,67 --> 0:10:56,389
AND BY IDENTIFYING CREATIVE WAYS TO GENERATE
SIG SIGNIFICANT COST SAVINGS.


146
0:10:56,389 --> 0:11:1,66
THE MOVE ACCENTS PACKAGE DELIVERY HAS GONE
UP 14% SINCE 2010, WHILE LETTERS AND OTHER


147
0:11:1,66 --> 0:11:6,89
MAIL HAS DECLINED WITH THE INCREASING USE
OF E MAIL, AND INTERNET SERVICES.


148
0:11:6,89 --> 0:11:11,199
PEOPLE FACING A TERMINAL ILLNESS WILL HAVE
A NEW OPTION FOR CARE IN THE NORTH COUNTY.


149
0:11:11,199 --> 0:11:16,449
A SIX BEDROOM HOSPICE HOUSE WILL OPEN IN CARLSBAD
A.ONE MILLION DOLLAR FEDERAL GRANT FROM THE


150
0:11:16,449 --> 0:11:19,99
CITY MADE IT POSSIBLE.
THIS COMES IN THE WAKE OF SAN DIEGO HOSPICE


151
0:11:19,99 --> 0:11:25,69
FILING FOR BANKRUPTCY AND AS WE REPORT SAID
LAST NIGHT, SCRIPPS HEALTH IS ADDING HOSPICE


152
0:11:25,69 --> 0:11:27,439
CARE.
PUBLIC SCHOOL LEADERS SAY TEEPER PREPARATIONS


153
0:11:27,439 --> 0:11:31,3
PROGRAMS LEAVE INSTRUCTORS WELL VERSED IN
THEORY BUT NOT SO WELL EQUIPPED TO MANAGE


154
0:11:31,3 --> 0:11:34,22
A CLASSROOM.
KYLA CALVERT TELLS US HOW HIGH TECH HIGH CHARTER


155
0:11:34,22 --> 0:11:37,37
SCHOOL CREATED THEIR OWN TEACHER TRAINING
PROKING PROGRAMS AND DEVELOPED A GRADUATE


156
0:11:37,37 --> 0:11:40,72

IN THE ADVISORY CLASS AT HIGH TECH MIDDLE
SCHOOL IN POINT LOMA.


158
0:11:44,529 --> 0:11:49,149
THAT MAGIC WORD WAS PROJECT TOAP YOU.
STUDENTS STARTED THIS UNIT BY BRAIN STORMING


159
0:11:49,149 --> 0:11:53,439
QUESTIONS; QUESTIONS THEY HAD ABOUT ANYTHING.
THEN THEY CATEGORIZE THE QUESTIONS OF THE


160
0:11:53,439 --> 0:11:55,42
CLASS.
>> >>GUEST SPEAKER: THROUGH CREATING THOSE


161
0:11:55,42 --> 0:12:0,31
CATEGORIES WE FOUND SIMILARITIES IN OUR QUESTIONS
AND ALSO FOUND HOW OUR QUESTIONS ABOUT OURSELF


162
0:12:0,31 --> 0:12:4,389
CONNECT WITH QUESTIONS ABOUT THE WORLD.
>> >>GUEST SPEAKER: THEN GROUPS OF STUDENTS


163
0:12:4,389 --> 0:12:8,459
CHOSE ONE OF THE BROAD QUESTION CATEGORIES.
>> >>GUEST SPEAKER: WE'RE MAKING THAT ONE


164
0:12:8,459 --> 0:12:11,24
QUESTION AND THEN WE'RE TRYING TO LOOK OUT
FOR WHAT CAN WE MAKE OUT OF THAT QUESTION.


165
0:12:11,24 --> 0:12:15,4
LIKE, WHAT PRODUCT CAN WE MAKE.
>> >>GUEST SPEAKER: HER GROUP'S IDEA FOR A


166
0:12:15,4 --> 0:12:18,509
PROJECT WAS A FAMILY TREE.
>> >>GUEST SPEAKER: WE'RE DOING A 3 D TREE


167
0:12:18,509 --> 0:12:22,61
AND PUTTING OUR ANCESTORS AND MAKING AN ARTICLE
ABOUT ONE ANCESTOR AND WHAT KIND OF HISTORY


168
0:12:22,61 --> 0:12:26,329
THEY TOOK IN.
>> >>GUEST SPEAKER: STUDENTS ARE READING OTHER


169
0:12:26,329 --> 0:12:33,37
GROUPS PROJECT IDEAS AND LEAVING THEIR COMMENTS
ABOUT WHAT WILL WORK AND WHAT MIGHT NOT ON


170
0:12:33,37 --> 0:12:38,519
BRIGHT POST IT NOTES.
AT THE 11 HIGH TECH HIGH CHARTER SCHOOLS IN


171
0:12:38,519 --> 0:12:42,89
SAN DIEGO, PROJECT BASED CLASSES ARE THE NORM.
STUDENTS DESIGNED PROJECTS ARE EVERYWHERE


172
0:12:42,89 --> 0:12:44,47
ON THE SIX SCHOOLS.
ON THE WALLS AND CEILINGS, DECORATING THE


173
0:12:44,47 --> 0:12:48,11
BATHROOMS.
SINCE THE FIRST HIGH TECH HIGH SCHOOL STARTED


174
0:12:48,11 --> 0:12:51,6
IN 2000.
THAT GREW INTO A STATE LICENSED TEACHER CREDENTIALING


175
0:12:51,6 --> 0:12:54,93
PROGRAM AND THEN INTO TWO MASTER DEGREE PROGRAMS
IN TEACHER AND SCHOOL LEADERSHIP WHICH STARTED


176
0:12:54,93 --> 0:12:58,689
IN 2007.
BEN DAILY, CHIEF ACADEMIC OFFICER OF THE HIGH


177
0:12:58,689 --> 0:13:5,55
TECH HIGH GRADUATE SCHOOL OF EDUCATION SAYS
THEY'RE OFFERING THE KIND OF HANDS ON TRAINING


178
0:13:5,55 --> 0:13:10,11
THAT'S MISSING FROM MANY TRADITIONAL PROGRAMS.
>> >>GUEST SPEAKER: IT'S NOT LIKE IN TRADITIONAL


179
0:13:10,11 --> 0:13:16,509
GRADUATE SCHOOLS, THERE'S NONE OF THAT RK
THERE'S NOTHING PRACTICAL AND IN OUR SCHOOL


180
0:13:16,509 --> 0:13:21,249
NOTHING THEORETICAL.
WE'RE SAYING WHATEVER THAT BALANCE IS, WE


181
0:13:21,249 --> 0:13:30,35
THINK IT'S A LITTLE OUT OF WHACK AND WE'RE
TRYING TO SWING IT BACK TO MORE PRACTD OWS


182
0:13:30,35 --> 0:13:34,91
BASED MODEL.
>> >>GUEST SPEAKER: HE POINTS TO THAT PRACTICALITY


183
0:13:34,91 --> 0:13:39,92
AS THE MAJOR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THIS PROGRAM
AND THE TRADITIONAL CREDENTIALING PROGRAM


184
0:13:39,92 --> 0:13:45,35
HE WENT THROUGH WHEN HE FIRST STARTED TEACHING.
>> >>GUEST SPEAKER: IT'S APPLIED, INTEGRATED


185
0:13:45,35 --> 0:13:49,87
INTO WHAT I'M DOING.
SO MY ACTION RESEARCH WHICH IS AROUND DEMOCRATIC


186
0:13:49,87 --> 0:13:53,759
LEARNING AND COLLABORATIVE DESIGN WHICH YOU
GUYS SAW EARLIER TODAY, YOU KNOW, I RESEARCH


187
0:13:53,759 --> 0:13:58,3
THAT IN THE FIRST YEAR AND PREPARED CREATED
A THESIS PROPOSAL, AN OUT LINE OF WHAT I WAS


188
0:13:58,3 --> 0:14:0,41
GOING TO DO IN MY RESEARCH, AND THAT'S WHAT
I'VE DONE THIS YEAR.


189
0:14:0,41 --> 0:14:3,29
>> >>GUEST SPEAKER: THE GRADUATE SCHOOL STUDENTS
WORK FULL TIME AND ATTEND EVENING CLASSES


190
0:14:3,29 --> 0:14:8,59
WUNSZ A WEEK DURING THEIR FIRST YEAR, AND
ONCE EVERY OTHER WEEK DURING THEIR SECOND


191
0:14:8,59 --> 0:14:13,269
WHEN THEY'RE CONDUCTING THEIR RESEARCH PROJECTS.
WHAT THEY DO IN THOSE CLASSES CAN BE PRETTY


192
0:14:13,269 --> 0:14:15,699
SIMILAR TO WHAT THE MIDDLE SCHOOLERS WERE
WORKING ON.


193
0:14:15,699 --> 0:14:19,18
A RECENT FIRST YEAR SESSION STARTS WITH A
CLASS DISCUSSION, THEN STUDENTS BREAK INTO


194
0:14:19,18 --> 0:14:23,329
A GROUPS TO GET PEER FEEDBACKS FOR THE PROJECTS.
>> >>GUEST SPEAKER: SOME SORT OF STRUCTURE


195
0:14:23,329 --> 0:14:26,29
PEOPLE CAN INTERACT WITH AND IT WOULD MAKE
MUSIC.


196
0:14:26,29 --> 0:14:31,939
>> >>GUEST SPEAKER: WHILE MANY THE GRADUATE
STUDENTS WORK IN ONE OF HIGH TECH HIGH SCHOOLS


197
0:14:31,939 --> 0:14:37,809
THEY COME FROM TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS.
MUL LIS UH SAYS INTEGRATEING PROJECT BASED


198
0:14:37,809 --> 0:14:40,89
WORK AND STUDENT FEEDBACK INTO HER TRADITIONAL
CLASSROOM CAN BE STRESSFUL.


199
0:14:40,89 --> 0:14:44,18
>> >>GUEST SPEAKER: MY BENCH MARK'S GO TOOK
LOOKED AT THERE'S THIS PRESSURE I HAVE TO


200
0:14:44,18 --> 0:14:48,329
GO BACK AND TEACH ACCORD TO THE DI DISTRICT'S
CURRICULUM, BUT I'VE CHOSEN NOT TO.


201
0:14:48,329 --> 0:14:51,529
BUT TO TEACH IN THE WAY I THINK MY STUDENTS
ARE RESPONDING TO.


202
0:14:51,529 --> 0:14:53,76
SO I FEEL THAT THE CLASH HAS BEEN MORE INTERNALLY
FOR ME.


203
0:14:53,76 --> 0:14:57,949
>> >>GUEST SPEAKER: STACEY DIRECTS THE TEACHER
LEADERSHIP PROGRAM AS THE GRADUATE SCHOOL


204
0:14:57,949 --> 0:15:2,129
MOVES THROUGH THE ACCREDITATION PROCESS, THEY'RE
NOT LOOKING TO REVOLUTIONIZE TEACHER ACCREDITATIONÊ


205
0:15:2,129 --> 0:15:5,329
>> >>GUEST SPEAKER: OUR GOAL IS NOT TO CREATE
A BUNCH MORE HIGH TECH HIGHS.


206
0:15:5,329 --> 0:15:11,91
THE GOAL IS FOR PEOPLE TO EMERGE FROM OUR
PROGRAMS WITH A BETTER SENSE OF WHAT THE EDUCATION


207
0:15:11,91 --> 0:15:34,759
IN THE SCHOOL THAT THEY KIND OF ASPIRE AND
DREAM ABOUT LOOKS LIKE AND TO HAVE MADE SOME


208
0:15:34,759 --> 0:15:38,5
STEPS TOWARDS THAT WHILE THEY'RE HERE.
>> >>GUEST SPEAKER: BUT LEARNING TO RUN HER


209
0:15:38,5 --> 0:15:43,66
CLASSROOM MORE LIKE SHE MIGHT IF SHE WORKED
AT A HIGH TECH SCHOOL IS WHAT DREW HAWN TO


210
0:15:43,66 --> 0:15:48,249
THE SCHOOL SCIVMENT ID GO TO THEIR EXHIBITIONS
AND COME AWAY FEELING LIKE THESE KIDS LOVE


211
0:15:48,249 --> 0:15:52,68
WHAT THEY'RE LEARNING AND I DIDN'T EVEN NEED
TO FIND THE TEACHER.


212
0:15:52,68 --> 0:15:58,589
THE KIDS WERE HAPPY, FELT PROUD, AND I REMEMBER
GOING HOME AND THINKING WHY CAN'T MY STUDENTS


213
0:15:58,589 --> 0:16:1,72
ARE V THAT.
>> >>GUEST SPEAKER: THE GRADUATED SCHOOL STUDENTS


214
0:16:1,72 --> 0:16:7,5
MAY LEAVE THE PROGRAM EQUIPPED TO LEAD PROJECT
BASED CLASSES AND SCHOOLS AND TO CHANGE THE


215
0:16:7,5 --> 0:16:9,76
FACE OF PUBLIC EDUCATION.
KYLA CALVERT, KPBS NEWS.

>> >>DWANE: SAN DIEGANS DRIVE MORE HIGHWAY
MILES EACH DAY THAN JUST ABOUT ANYONE ELSE


217
0:16:18,35 --> 0:16:21,329
IN THE STATE.
IN FACT, AMERICANS SPENT FIVE AND A HALF BILLION


218
0:16:21,329 --> 0:16:27,629
HOURS IDLING IN TRAFFIC IN 2011. THE COST
IS MORE THAN JUST TIME.

MATT FREEDMAN HAS THIS STORY.
>> >>GUEST SPEAKER: WASHINGTON IS WELL KNOWN


220

>> >>GUEST SPEAKER: AND BEING STUCK IN TRAFFIC


224
0:16:51,93 --> 0:16:54,3
ISN'T JUST AN INCONVENIENCE, IT COSTS EVERYONE
MONEY.


225
0:16:54,3 --> 0:17:0,8
THE LATEST URBAN MOBILITY REPORT SAYS CLOGGED
ROADS COST AMERICANS 121ÊBILLION DOLLARS


226
0:17:0,8 --> 0:17:10,49
IN TIME AND MONEY IN 2011.
>> >>GUEST SPEAKER: IT'S HORRIBLE, ALWAYS


227
0:17:10,49 --> 0:17:22,73
BACK TO BACK, AND THE ROADS ARE WORSE ENOUGH.
THIS TAKES FOREVER.


228

I USED TO LIVE IN L.A. BUT IT TAKES AS LONG
FOR ME TO COMMUTE.

A SAYS DRIVERS SHOULD CONTACT LAW MAKERS AND
ASK THEM TO MAKE TRANSPORTATION FUNDINGA BIGGER

235
0:18:35,89 --> 0:18:49,7
SCHEDULES SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO DRIVE OR COMMUTE
IN 
THE PEEK OF RUSH HOUR, THAT'S HELPFUL.


236
0:18:49,7 --> 0:18:54,39
MORE TELECOMMUTING WOULD BE HELPFUL.
>> >>GUEST SPEAKER: STILL A REPORT FINDS THAT


237
