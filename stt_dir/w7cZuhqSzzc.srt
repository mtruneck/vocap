AS PAINLESSLY AS POSSIBLE


185
0:12:35,2 --> 0:12:37,523

TO MAKE THEM SUFFER?

APPROACH OTHER PEOPLE,

FOR THEIR LIVES AND
SCREAMING IN PAIN,

THE SAME FLESH,

COULD NOT BE MORE ACCURATE.


194
0:14:46,18 --> 0:14:49,521

THE TARGETED PEOPLE,

198
0:15:0,966 --> 0:15:7,39

OF SUCH CRUELTY

A FAMILY OR TWO FAMILIES?

Goldhagen: IN THESE HILLS,


206
0:16:28,654 --> 0:16:32,157
THE GUATEMALAN MILITARY
CONDUCTED A SCORCHED-EARTH
CAMPAIGN


207
0:16:32,157 --> 0:16:36,561
AGAINST MAYA
AND LEFTIST INSURGENTS.


208
0:16:36,561 --> 0:16:39,564
THE MAYAN PEOPLE, THEY SAID,
WERE INHERENTLY SUBVERSIVE


209
0:16:39,564 --> 0:16:47,606
AND AN IMPEDIMENT TO PROGRESS.


210
0:16:47,606 --> 0:16:49,941
THE GOVERNMENT STRATEGY
WAS SUMMED UP


211

212
0:16:52,944 --> 0:17:1,62

YOU HAVE TO DRAIN THE POND."

OF PLAN DE SANCHEZ,


214
0:17:5,123 --> 0:17:27,379
THEY DRAINED THE POND
ON JULY 18, 1982.

0:17:27,379 --> 0:17:31,249
Woman: THE MILITARY WOULD
SEPARATE THE WOMEN AND THE MEN.


216
0:17:31,249 --> 0:17:35,253
SOMETIMES THEY WOULD TAKE
THE INFANTS OUT OF
THE WOMEN'S ARMS


217
0:17:35,253 --> 0:17:37,723
AND SIMPLY SMASH THEM
ON THE GROUND,


218
0:17:37,723 --> 0:17:39,958
KILL THEM RIGHT THERE
IN FRONT OF EVERYBODY.


219
0:17:39,958 --> 0:17:41,96
THEY CUT TONGUES OUT.


220
0:17:41,96 --> 0:17:43,962
THEY OPENED
PREGNANT WOMEN'S BELLIES


221
0:17:43,962 --> 0:17:46,465
AND DASHED FETUSES
AGAINST TREES.


222
0:17:46,465 --> 0:17:49,468
THEY BURNED PEOPLE ALIVE.


223
0:17:49,468 --> 0:17:53,4
WE KNOW THIS BECAUSE
THERE WERE PEOPLE


224
0:17:53,4 --> 0:17:57,509
WHO, EVEN IN THE MIDST
OF THIS MAYHEM AND MASS KILLING,


225
0:17:57,509 --> 0:18:0,11
SOMEHOW MANAGED TO HIDE--
BEHIND A DOOR,


226

OF CORN HUSKS--


227

TO GUATEMALA DID I REALIZE


229

HOW REMOTE
THESE MOUNTAIN VILLAGES
REALLY ARE.


230
0:19:29,367 --> 0:19:32,504

THESE SUBSISTENCE FARMERS


231

A THREAT TO THE WELL-BEING
OF THE COUNTRY,


232
0:19:35,407 --> 0:19:39,411
BUT THEY DID NOT POSE
A THREAT TO ANYONE.


233
0:19:39,411 --> 0:20:53,285
THE GUATEMALAN PERPETRATORS
OBLITERATED ONE SUCH COMMUNITY
AFTER ANOTHER.


234
0:20:53,285 --> 0:20:58,256
Goldhagen:
EVERYWHERE I GO, THE FACES
OF CHILDREN HAUNT ME THE MOST.


235
0:20:58,256 --> 0:21:0,692
I HAVE CHILDREN, TOO,


236
0:21:0,692 --> 0:21:3,862
AND IT'S HARD NOT TO THINK
ABOUT THEM AS I HEAR STORIES


237
0:21:3,862 --> 0:21:7,432
OVER AND OVER ABOUT THE CRUELTY

238

MOST OF THEM
CHILDREN AND
THE OTHERS WOMEN.


240
0:21:13,939 --> 0:21:17,442
SO THERE WASN'T
A SINGLE ADULT MALE,
SO WHICH CAN--


241
0:21:17,442 --> 0:21:19,945
YOU KNOW,
YOU CAN SAY
LETS YOU UNDERSTAND


242
0:21:19,945 --> 0:21:21,947
THAT THESE ARE NOT
COMBAT DEATHS.


243
0:21:21,947 --> 0:21:24,95
OH, NO. YEAH, YOU KNOW,
IT'S VERY COMMON
IN MASS MURDERS


244
0:21:24,95 --> 0:21:24,95
FOR THE PERPETRATORS
TO DO THIS TO CHILDREN...


245
0:21:24,95 --> 0:21:27,452
YEAH.


246
0:21:27,452 --> 0:21:29,454

AND THE HOLOCAUST.

IS IN CHARGE OF COLLECTING
AND CATALOGUING THE BONES.


249
0:21:35,961 --> 0:21:38,463
THEY PORTRAY A MESSAGE.
WHEN THEY DO THIS,


250
0:21:38,463 --> 0:21:41,466
THEY ARE ALSO KILLING
THE SEED OF EVIL,
ACCORDING TO THEM,


251
0:21:41,466 --> 0:21:43,401
WHETHER IT BE
IN NAZI GERMANY


252
0:21:43,401 --> 0:21:45,904
OR WHETHER IT BE
IN GUATEMALA
IN THE 1980s.


253
0:21:45,904 --> 0:21:49,908
BUT THIS IS THE BONE LAB
OF THE FORENSIC
ANTHROPOLOGY LABORATORY.


254
0:21:49,908 --> 0:21:52,811
FREDY IS AMASSING
A RECORD OF THE ATROCITIES


255
0:21:52,811 --> 0:21:54,879

257

FAMILIES WITH THE REMAINS
TO BURY PROPERLY.


258

THE BONES HOLD THE STORY


259
0:22:2,954 --> 0:22:5,924
OF WHAT HAPPENED TO
A PERSON DURING THEIR LIFE


260
0:22:5,924 --> 0:22:8,927
AND MIGHT EVEN TELL US
WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM


261
0:22:8,927 --> 0:22:10,929
DURING THE EVENT
OF THEIR DEATH


262
0:22:10,929 --> 0:22:12,731
AND EVEN WHAT HAPPENED
TO THEM AFTER DEATH.


263
0:22:12,731 --> 0:22:16,735

WE CAN SEE...HOW...


264
0:22:16,735 --> 0:22:20,739
AND IF YOU WANT, I'LL
ALLOW YOU TO FEEL THE
DIFFERENCE SO YOU CAN SEE.


265
0:22:20,739 --> 0:22:23,241
THIS IS A VERY SHARP CUT,
AND IF YOU RUN YOUR HAND
THROUGH IT,


266
0:22:23,241 --> 0:22:23,241
IT'S VERY, VERY SMOOTH.


267
0:22:23,241 --> 0:22:25,744
MM-HMM.


268
0:22:25,744 --> 0:22:28,913
YOU SEE, THAT WAS CAUSED
BY A MACHETE STRIKING


269
0:22:28,913 --> 0:22:32,884
THE RIGHT SIDE OF THE HEAD
AND ALSO CUTTING THE ATLAS.


270
0:22:32,884 --> 0:22:35,42
AND, YOU SEE,
WHEN YOU MATCH IT UP
ANATOMICALLY,


271
0:22:35,42 --> 0:22:35,42
YOU CAN SEE THAT
THIS TRAUMA HERE...


272
0:22:35,42 --> 0:22:38,123
RIGHT.


273
0:22:38,123 --> 0:22:40,125
IS RELATED
TO THIS STRIKE HERE,


274
0:22:40,125 --> 0:22:42,861
AND BASICALLY WHAT
THEY TRIED TO DO HERE IS
DECAPITATE THE PERSON.


275
0:22:42,861 --> 0:22:45,363
NOW, WHAT WE'VE SEEN
USUALLY IS THAT


276
0:22:45,363 --> 0:22:48,366
THESE PEOPLE WERE NOT
VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE
OF ANATOMY,


277
0:22:48,366 --> 0:22:51,36
SO THE DECAPITATIONS,
AS YOU'D EXPECT,


278
0:22:51,36 --> 0:22:54,372
WERE NOT ALWAYS SUCCESSFUL,
SO YOU HAVE REPEATED BLOWS
TO THE HEAD.

TO SEPARATE THE HEAD
FROM THE BODY.

OF EVEN CRIMES OF PASSION.

THERE'S A WORD


282

I DON'T THINK I'LL EVER HEAR
THE SAME WAY AGAIN.


283

IF THE KILLERS WERE
SIMPLY DOING THEIR DUTY


284

TO WIPE OUT AN INSURGENCY,
AS THEY CLAIM,


285
0:23:10,955 --> 0:23:14,459
THEY WOULD EXECUTE THEIR VICTIMS
QUICKLY AND BE DONE WITH IT.


286
0:23:14,459 --> 0:23:19,464
YOU HAVE TO WONDER WHY
WE SEE SO MUCH EVIDENCE
OF SUCH MURDEROUS PASSION,


287
0:23:19,464 --> 0:23:21,966
ESPECIALLY AGAINST
WOMEN AND CHILDREN.


288
0:23:21,966 --> 0:23:24,469
THIS IS A CHILD HERE,
A VERY YOUNG CHILD.


289
0:23:24,469 --> 0:23:26,471
I WOULDN'T EVEN DARE
TO TELL YOU THE AGE


290
0:23:26,471 --> 0:23:28,973
UNLESS WITH
THE ANTHROPOLOGIST
WORKING ON THE CASE,


291
0:23:28,973 --> 0:23:31,976
AND YOU CAN COMPARE--
THIS IS THE FIRST RIB.


292
0:23:31,976 --> 0:23:34,979
WOW.


293
0:23:34,979 --> 0:23:37,982
SO...AND IF
YOU COMPARE THIS


294
0:23:37,982 --> 0:23:39,984
TO THAT ONE,
YOU CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE.


295
0:23:39,984 --> 0:23:42,487

ABOUT THAT BIG, SO THIS
IS A VERY, VERY SMALL--

300
0:23:52,13 --> 0:23:54,632

THERE'S A--A WAY OF...

HUMANLY
UNDERSTANDING THIS


302
0:23:56,634 --> 0:24:0,71

BEYOND WHAT I BELIEVE
HUMANS CAN DO,


303
0:24:0,71 --> 0:24:2,574
BUT OBVIOUSLY--I MEAN,
THE MORE I SAY THAT,
THE MORE I TEND TO--


304
0:24:2,574 --> 0:24:4,576
IT'S HARD FOR ME
TO BELIEVE


305
0:24:4,576 --> 0:24:6,578
THAT YOU'RE
SAYING THIS,
GIVEN WHAT YOU--


306
0:24:6,578 --> 0:24:10,81
BECAUSE I WANT TO BELIEVE
THAT WE'RE NOT CAPABLE
OF THESE THINGS,

EVEN THOUGH--
I WANT TO BELIEVE
THAT THIS IS WRONG.


308
0:24:12,584 --> 0:24:14,586
SO DOING THIS
HAS TO BE WRONG.


309
0:24:14,586 --> 0:24:17,88
IF I ACCEPTED THIS
AS RIGHT AND IF
I EXCUSE IT,

DO THIS ANYMORE.

FOR THE KILLERS TO COMMIT

THERE'S A LOT
TO MAKE SENSE OF HERE.


696
0:51:10,467 --> 0:51:13,47
IT SEEMS TO ME WE'VE BEEN
MISSING A CRITICAL POINT


697
0:51:13,47 --> 0:51:15,972
IN UNDERSTANDING THESE HORRORS.


698
0:51:15,972 --> 0:51:19,476
THE MASTERMINDS OF GENOCIDE
USE DIFFERENT MEANS


699

TO GET RID OF UNWANTED PEOPLE.

0:51:39,629 --> 0:51:45,635
SO WHAT WE OFTEN THINK OF
AS GENOCIDE IS NEVER JUST
ABOUT KILLING.

0:51:45,635 --> 0:51:48,471
WHAT THE PERPETRATORS WANT
MOST OF ALL


707
0:51:48,471 --> 0:51:59,983
IS TO ELIMINATE
A SUBSTANTIAL PART OR ALL
OF THE TARGETED GROUP.


708
0:51:59,983 --> 0:52:2,919
TERMS LIKE "GENOCIDE"
OR EVEN "MASS MURDER"


709
0:52:2,919 --> 0:52:9,926
ARE INADEQUATE TO DESCRIBE
THE PHENOMENON WE HAVE
REPEATEDLY WITNESSED.

0:52:9,926 --> 0:52:14,998
AS A POLITICAL SCIENTIST,
I LIVE AND WORK IN A WORLD
OF ISMS.


711
0:52:14,998 --> 0:52:19,769
THIS ONE WE SHOULD CALL
ELIMINATIONISM.


712
0:52:19,769 --> 0:52:26,276
REFRAMING THE WAY WE THINK
ABOUT THESE DEEDS IS NOT JUST
AN INTELLECTUAL EXERCISE.

IT'S A CRITICAL COMPONENT
OF UNDERSTANDING

0:52:28,778 --> 0:52:34,784
THAT GENOCIDE IS ONE PART
OF A LARGER PHENOMENON

INCLUDES KILLING OR NOT.

WAS ALSO DIFFERENT.

1:1:38,861 --> 1:1:41,197
Woman: OUR GOVERNMENT IS
FLAT OUT WRONG


866
1:1:41,197 --> 1:1:44,633
IN THEIR REFUSAL TO RECOGNIZE
THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE.


867
1:1:44,633 --> 1:1:49,305
WE MUST CALL GENOCIDE
BY ITS NAME.


868
1:1:49,305 --> 1:1:51,34
Schiff: WE CAN'T
HAVE THE KIND
OF LEADERSHIP


869
1:1:51,34 --> 1:1:54,81
THAT WE NEED
IN STOPPING GENOCIDE
GOING ON TODAY


870
1:1:54,81 --> 1:1:58,314
IF WE'RE EQUIVOCAL
ABOUT THE MURDER
OF OTHER PEOPLE


871
1:1:58,314 --> 1:2:2,618
BECAUSE IT MIGHT
OFFEND AN ALLY.


872
1:2:2,618 --> 1:2:4,86
I SHOULD THINK THAT
IT WOULD BE A NO-BRAINER


873
1:2:4,86 --> 1:2:6,222
THAT A RESOLUTION BE PASSED
TO ACKNOWLEDGE THIS.


874
1:2:6,222 --> 1:2:7,623
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?


875
1:2:7,623 --> 1:2:9,458
WELL, IT SHOULD BE
A NO-BRAINER.


876
1:2:9,458 --> 1:2:12,461
AS IT IS, IT'S
AN ENORMOUSLY
DIFFICULT CHALLENGE.


877
1:2:12,461 --> 1:2:16,732
WHEN THE GENOCIDE
RESOLUTION WAS IN
COMMITTEE LAST FALL,


878
1:2:16,732 --> 1:2:18,1
THE PRESIDENT
OF THE UNITED STATES


879
1:2:18,1 --> 1:2:21,237
WAS ON THE PHONE,
CALLING COMMITTEE
MEMBERS AT THEIR HOME


880
1:2:21,237 --> 1:2:22,772
TO URGE THEM TO VOTE
AGAINST IT.


881
1:2:22,772 --> 1:2:22,772
FOR THIS RESOLUTION?


882
1:2:22,772 --> 1:2:24,573
FOR THIS RESOLUTION.


883
1:2:24,573 --> 1:2:27,676
WE ALL DEEPLY REGRET
THE TRAGIC SUFFERING
OF THE ARMENIAN PEOPLE


884
1:2:27,676 --> 1:2:31,514
THAT BEGAN IN 1915.


885
1:2:31,514 --> 1:2:33,482
THIS RESOLUTION IS NOT
THE RIGHT RESPONSE


886
1:2:33,482 --> 1:2:35,618
TO THESE HISTORIC MASS KILLINGS.


887
1:2:35,618 --> 1:2:36,719
THE PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE


888
1:2:36,719 --> 1:2:37,887
IS THAT THIS IS CLEARLY


889
1:2:37,887 --> 1:2:39,221
A VERY SENSITIVE SUBJECT


890
1:2:39,221 --> 1:2:40,689
FOR ONE OF OUR CLOSEST ALLIES.


891
1:2:40,689 --> 1:2:43,492
YOU HAD MEMBERS
OF THE JOINT CHIEFS OF
STAFF CALLING MEMBERS,


892
1:2:43,492 --> 1:2:46,228
YOU HAD
THE SECRETARY OF
STATE CALLING MEMBERS.


893
1:2:46,228 --> 1:2:50,299
I'VE NEVER SEEN
A FULL-COURT PRESS LIKE
THIS ON ANY RESOLUTION.


894
1:2:50,299 --> 1:2:52,501
I DON'T THINK
WE STRENGTHEN
OUR RELATIONSHIP


895
1:2:52,501 --> 1:2:54,97
EVEN WITH AN ALLY
WHEN WE TURN A BLIND EYE


896
1:2:54,97 --> 1:2:58,774
TO SOME
OF THE WORST CHAPTERS
IN HUMAN HISTORY.


897
1:2:58,774 --> 1:3:2,111
Goldhagen: OUR POLITICIANS
MAY FAIL TO LEARN FROM HISTORY,


898
1:3:2,111 --> 1:3:4,447
BUT THERE IS AMPLE EVIDENCE
THAT MASS MURDERERS


899
1:3:4,447 --> 1:3:6,482
HAVE LEARNED QUITE WELL.


900
1:3:6,482 --> 1:3:8,25
Man: SUDANESE PRESIDENT
OMAR AL-BASHIR


901
1:3:8,25 --> 1:3:9,685
HAS BEEN ACCUSED
OF MASTERMINDING


902
1:3:9,685 --> 1:3:12,54
A CAMPAIGN
OF GENOCIDE IN DARFUR.


903
1:3:12,54 --> 1:3:15,791
Goldhagen: 20 YEARS BEFORE
THE RECENT CRISIS IN DARFUR,


904
1:3:15,791 --> 1:3:18,461
THE SAME SUDANESE GOVERNMENT
KILLED AND EXPELLED


905
1:3:18,461 --> 1:3:25,668
EVEN MORE PEOPLE
IN SOUTHERN SUDAN.


906
1:3:25,668 --> 1:3:27,703
AFTER KILLING TWO MILLION THEN,


907
1:3:27,703 --> 1:3:30,84
THE SUDANESE LEADER
OMAR AL-BASHIR LEARNED


908
1:3:30,84 --> 1:3:36,745
THAT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY
WOULD LET HIM DO IT AGAIN.


909
1:3:36,745 --> 1:3:50,392
WHY DOES THE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY FAIL TO INTERVENE
TIME AND TIME AGAIN?


910
1:3:50,392 --> 1:3:54,296
JUST TELL ME.


911
1:3:54,296 --> 1:3:55,965
Madeleine Albright:
AS OUR REPORT EMPHASIZES,


912
1:3:55,965 --> 1:3:58,767
THE CHOICE WE FACE IN TRYING
TO PREVENT GENOCIDE


913
1:3:58,767 --> 1:4:2,638
IS RARELY A CASE
OF ALL OR NOTHING.


914
1:4:2,638 --> 1:4:5,641
THERE IS A BROAD RANGE
OF FOREIGN POLICY OPTIONS


915
1:4:5,641 --> 1:4:9,411
BETWEEN STANDING ASIDE
AND ORDERING IN THE MARINES.


916
1:4:9,411 --> 1:4:12,648
Goldhagen: THE CO-CHAIR
OF A RECENT TASK FORCE
ON THE SUBJECT,


917
1:4:12,648 --> 1:4:15,384
FORMER SECRETARY OF STATE

918
1:4:15,384 --> 1:4:18,254
SERVED AS U.S. AMBASSADOR
TO THE UNITED NATIONS


919
1:4:18,254 --> 1:4:20,823
DURING THE BOSNIAN
AND RWANDAN GENOCIDES.


920

[ELEVATOR PINGING]


921
1:4:32,134 --> 1:4:34,503
Goldhagen: YOU KNOW,
IF ONE IS SIMPLY NAIVE,


922
1:4:34,503 --> 1:4:39,642
ONE SEES A WORLD
OF POWERFUL COUNTRIES
USUALLY LOOKING ON


923
1:4:39,642 --> 1:4:42,978
WITH SOME INEPTITUDE
AT BEST AT COUNTRIES


924
1:4:42,978 --> 1:4:44,713
THAT ARE POOR
AND NOT VERY POWERFUL


925
1:4:44,713 --> 1:4:47,116
IN WHICH THEIR LEADERSHIP
IS SLAUGHTERING PEOPLE,


926
1:4:47,116 --> 1:4:49,585
AND YOU WONDER
HOW CAN THIS BE?


927
1:4:49,585 --> 1:4:51,287
IF YOU GO TO PEOPLE
AND YOU SAY,


928
1:4:51,287 --> 1:4:53,155
"YOU CAN PREVENT
MASS MURDER,"


929
1:4:53,155 --> 1:4:55,124
THEN MOST PEOPLE
WILL THINK,


930
1:4:55,124 --> 1:4:57,59
"OK. I'LL DO
THE BEST I CAN."


931
1:4:57,59 --> 1:5:0,229
THE PROBLEM IS
THAT WORLD LEADERS


932
1:5:0,229 --> 1:5:2,431
OR LEADERS GENERALLY
ARE DISTRACTED.


933
1:5:2,431 --> 1:5:3,799
THERE'S SO MUCH
TO DO.


934
1:5:3,799 --> 1:5:5,434
IT ISN'T AS IF
THEY'RE NOT
DOING ANYTHING.


935
1:5:5,434 --> 1:5:7,636
THERE'S NO WAY
TO DESCRIBE
TO SOMEONE


936
1:5:7,636 --> 1:5:10,172
THAT HAS NEVER BEEN
IN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT


937
1:5:10,172 --> 1:5:14,243
OR ANY GOVERNMENT
HOW MANY THINGS ARE
HAPPENING EVERY HOUR


938
1:5:14,243 --> 1:5:18,914
AND REQUIRE ATTENTION
AND REQUIRE WILL
AND REQUIRE RESOURCES.


939
1:5:18,914 --> 1:5:22,84
THE QUESTION
IS WHETHER YOUR
GOVERNMENTAL SYSTEM


940
1:5:22,84 --> 1:5:27,22
IS SET UP IN A WAY
THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO
START FROM SCRATCH.


941
1:5:27,22 --> 1:5:28,824
WE CAN TALK
ABOUT RWANDA,


942
1:5:28,824 --> 1:5:31,193
WHERE THERE WERE MANY
DIFFERENT PLAYERS INVOLVED


943
1:5:31,193 --> 1:5:33,295
AND PEOPLE HAD
DIFFERENT DEGREES
OF KNOWLEDGE


944
1:5:33,295 --> 1:5:35,497
AT DIFFERENT TIMES
ABOUT WHAT WAS GOING ON.


945
1:5:35,497 --> 1:5:37,566
IT SEEMS THAT THERE WAS
A CLEAR LACK OF WILL--


946
1:5:37,566 --> 1:5:39,535
NOT GOODWILL IN THE SENSE
OF COURSE PEOPLE DIDN'T WANT


947
1:5:39,535 --> 1:5:41,36
THE PEOPLE THERE
TO BE SLAUGHTERED,


948
1:5:41,36 --> 1:5:44,173
BUT WILL ACTUALLY
TO TAKE THE SACRIFICE


949
1:5:44,173 --> 1:5:45,374
OR MAKE THE SACRIFICE
THAT WAS NECESSARY


950
1:5:45,374 --> 1:5:46,775
SEE, I DISAGREE
WITH YOU.


951
1:5:46,775 --> 1:5:50,479
THE BELGIANS PULLED OUT,
DALLAIRE WAS--
YOU KNOW THE STORY.


952
1:5:50,479 --> 1:5:54,917
DALLAIRE WAS
CRYING OUT
FOR MORE SUPPORT.


953
1:5:54,917 --> 1:5:57,286
MAYBE NOT EVERYONE
COULD HAVE BEEN SAVED,


954
1:5:57,286 --> 1:5:58,621
BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE
COULD HAVE BEEN SAVED.


955
1:5:58,621 --> 1:6:0,789
I MEAN, THIS IS
AN ISSUE THAT WEIGHS
VERY HEAVY


956
1:6:0,789 --> 1:6:2,191
ON ALL OUR HEARTS.


957
1:6:2,191 --> 1:6:3,692
WE WERE AT THE SAME
TIME DEALING


958
1:6:3,692 --> 1:6:6,729
WITH SOMALIA,
BOSNIA, HAITI,


959
1:6:6,729 --> 1:6:8,864
A FEW OTHER THINGS
THAT WERE GOING ON,


960
1:6:8,864 --> 1:6:12,568
AND I THINK THAT
PEOPLE DID NOT
FULLY UNDERSTAND


961
1:6:12,568 --> 1:6:15,4
ALL THE HUTU-TUTSI
RIVALRY


962
1:6:15,4 --> 1:6:17,106
AND THE INTERNAL
THINGS THAT WERE
BUILDING UP.


963
1:6:17,106 --> 1:6:20,242
THAT, I THINK, WAS
SOMETHING THAT HAD
NOT BEEN PAID


964
1:6:20,242 --> 1:6:21,81
ENOUGH ATTENTION TO.


965
1:6:21,81 --> 1:6:24,146
IT IS MUCH EASIER
EX POST FACTO


966
1:6:24,146 --> 1:6:27,383
TO SAY WE KNEW THESE
KINDS OF THINGS
WERE GOING ON,


967
1:6:27,383 --> 1:6:30,519
BUT AT THE TIME
I WAS AMBASSADOR AT
THE UNITED NATIONS,


968
1:6:30,519 --> 1:6:36,725
AND I CAN TELL YOU
THAT THE INFORMATION
WAS NOT THERE.


969
1:6:36,725 --> 1:6:39,528
Goldhagen: I DON'T KNOW
WHAT KIND OF INFORMATION
ALBRIGHT NEEDED,


970
1:6:39,528 --> 1:6:42,64
BUT EVEN MORE THAN
DURING THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE,


971
1:6:42,64 --> 1:6:44,266
INFORMATION
ABOUT THE RWANDAN GENOCIDE


972
1:6:44,266 --> 1:6:48,671
WAS AVAILABLE TO ANYONE
WITH ACCESS TO TV OR NEWSPAPER,


973
1:6:48,671 --> 1:6:50,739
AS THERE WERE MULTIPLE
SOURCES OF INFORMATION


974
1:6:50,739 --> 1:6:52,474
COMING STRAIGHT FROM RWANDA,


975
1:6:52,474 --> 1:6:56,879
WHERE EVERYONE KNEW.

INCLUDING EMMANUEL GATARI,


978

MADE THEIR WAY
TO A TECHNICAL SCHOOL,

WHICH WAS BEING PROTECTED
BY U.N. PEACEKEEPERS.


980
1:7:54,47 --> 1:7:58,44
AS THE LIVES OF EMMANUEL
AND THE OTHERS WITH HIM
HUNG IN THE BALANCE,

FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS


982
1:8:0,42 --> 1:8:25,33

THEIR CITIZENS FROM RWANDA.

1:8:56,865 --> 1:9:0,169
FOR SECURITY, FOR PROTECTION,

AND THEY WITHDREW
AND LEFT THEM THERE


988

TO BE MASSACRED
IN COLD BLOOD.


989
1:9:13,382 --> 1:9:18,2
THIS IS REALLY SOMETHING
THAT THE U.N.


990
1:9:18,2 --> 1:9:20,55
SHOULD BE ABLE TO EXPLAIN.


991
1:9:20,55 --> 1:9:24,159
HOW DO YOU WITHDRAW PEOPLE WHO
ARE SUPPOSED TO PROTECT PEOPLE


992
1:9:24,159 --> 1:9:27,29
AT A TIME THAT IS
SO CRITICAL,


993
1:9:27,29 --> 1:10:53,782
AT A TIME WHEN YOU SEE
THE KILLINGS HAD
ALREADY STARTED?


994
1:10:53,782 --> 1:10:56,151
Goldhagen: A LACK OF INFORMATION
IS NOT THE REASON


995
1:10:56,151 --> 1:10:59,621
WORLD LEADERS FAIL TO INTERVENE
TO STOP GENOCIDES.


996
1:10:59,621 --> 1:11:5,761
THE PROBLEM IS A LACK OF WILL.


997
1:11:5,761 --> 1:11:9,97
FOR MORE THAN HALF A CENTURY,
PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD


998
1:11:9,97 --> 1:11:12,167
HAVE EXPECTED THE MEN AND WOMEN
HERE AT THE UNITED NATIONS


999
1:11:12,167 --> 1:11:15,17
TO PROTECT THEM,


1000
1:11:15,17 --> 1:11:20,275
AND TIME AND AGAIN,
THE U.N. HAS LET
THOSE PEOPLE DOWN.


1001
1:11:20,275 --> 1:11:23,545
I LOOK AROUND AT THE MANY STATES
HERE THAT HAVE TERRORIZED,


1002
1:11:23,545 --> 1:11:26,782
OPPRESSED, AND ELIMINATED
THEIR OWN PEOPLE,


1003
1:11:26,782 --> 1:11:30,352
AND I THINK, "WHY WOULD ANYONE
LOOK TO THIS BODY


1004
1:11:30,352 --> 1:11:36,358
TO COMBAT THESE EVILS
AROUND THE WORLD?"


1005
1:11:36,358 --> 1:11:39,94
IN 1948,
THE UNITED NATIONS ADOPTED


1006
1:11:39,94 --> 1:11:42,931
AN ANTIGENOCIDE CONVENTION
THAT LEGALLY DEFINED GENOCIDE


1007
1:11:42,931 --> 1:11:45,1
AND AUTHORIZED ITS MEMBER STATES


1008
1:11:45,1 --> 1:11:49,104
TO STOP AND PUNISH ACTS
OF MASS MURDER.


1009
1:11:49,104 --> 1:11:53,141

BUT TOTALLY INEFFECTIVE.

ALSO PROMOTE INTERVENTION

AND ASSISTANCE,

OF CAPACITY,

RECONCEPTUALIZING
CONCEPTS THE WAY
YOU HAVE


1032

WITH SOVEREIGNTY,
BUT YOU'RE


1033
1:12:57,939 --> 1:12:59,307
IN A MINORITY THERE,

1034
1:12:59,307 --> 1:13:0,342
ABSOLUTELY.

AND EVEN IN THIS
HALL IN PARTICULAR,


1036
1:13:2,544 --> 1:13:3,812
YOU WOULD BE
IN A MINORITY


1037

IF YOU WERE TO
STAND UP AND TO GIVE
AND SPEECH HERE,


1038

AND IT SEEMS TO ME
THAT SOVEREIGNTY


1039
1:13:9,818 --> 1:13:11,553
IS AN IMPORTANT
PRINCIPLE,


1040
1:13:11,553 --> 1:13:15,157
BUT WE SHOULD
MAKE CLEAR THAT IT
DOES NOT GO SO FAR


1041
1:13:15,157 --> 1:13:18,86
AS TO ALLOW
GOVERNMENTS TO
SLAUGHTER THEIR PEOPLE


1042

AND THAT THAT IN ITSELF,
THOSE ACTS IN ITSELF

YOUR RESPONSIBILITY


1044
1:13:25,1 --> 1:13:28,37
AND YOU DON'T
WELCOME HELP,
YOU HAVE NO WILL,


1045
1:13:28,37 --> 1:13:30,405
WE WILL TAKE
OTHER MEASURES.


1046
1:13:30,405 --> 1:13:35,77
AND THESE OTHER MEASURES
WE NEED TO DEVELOP
TO BE A CREDIBLE THREAT,


1047
1:13:35,77 --> 1:13:39,614
BUT MEANWHILE,
I'M JUST DOING WHAT IS
IN MY CAPACITY TO DO.


1048
1:13:39,614 --> 1:13:41,45
AND YOU'RE DOING
IT WELL.


1049
1:13:41,45 --> 1:13:44,252
Goldhagen, voice-over:
THERE ARE WELL-MEANING PEOPLE
HERE TO BE SURE,


1050
1:13:44,252 --> 1:13:46,254
BUT I'M AFRAID THEY'RE PART
OF AN INSTITUTION


1051
1:13:46,254 --> 1:13:49,458
THAT IS SET UP TO FAIL.


1052
1:13:49,458 --> 1:13:51,59
THE U.N. IS NOT THE SOLUTION,


1053
1:13:51,59 --> 1:13:53,228
AS ITS APPALLING RECORD SHOWS,


1054
1:13:53,228 --> 1:13:55,13
BUT I DO THINK WE CAN
DESIGN A SYSTEM


1055
1:13:55,13 --> 1:14:0,68
THAT WILL EFFECTIVELY STOP
OR PREVENT FUTURE GENOCIDES.


1056
1:14:0,68 --> 1:14:5,407
THE FIRST COMPONENT MUST BE
SWIFT DIPLOMATIC INTERVENTION.


1057
1:14:5,407 --> 1:14:9,878
A RECENT EPISODE HERE IN KENYA
MAY OFFER A PROMISING MODEL
FOR THE FUTURE.


1058
1:14:9,878 --> 1:14:12,681
Man: WHAT WAS ONCE ONE
OF AFRICA'S MOST
STABLE DEMOCRACIES


1059
1:14:12,681 --> 1:14:15,917
IS RIGHT NOW ONE OF THE MOST
VIOLENT PLACES IN THE WORLD.


1060
1:14:15,917 --> 1:14:19,321
EXTREME CHAOS FOLLOWING
A DISPUTED ELECTION IN KENYA,


1061
1:14:19,321 --> 1:14:21,256
MOBS TORCHING A CHURCH
WITH HUNDREDS


1062
1:14:21,256 --> 1:14:22,958
OF REFUGEES INSIDE.


1063
1:14:22,958 --> 1:14:25,527
WITNESSES SAY DOZENS OF PEOPLE,
INCLUDING CHILDREN,


1064
1:14:25,527 --> 1:14:28,597
WERE BURNED ALIVE OR HACKED
TO DEATH WITH MACHETES,


1065
1:14:28,597 --> 1:14:31,99
AND THERE ARE NEW FEARS TODAY
THAT KENYA IS IN DANGER


1066
1:14:31,99 --> 1:14:37,5
OF BECOMING THE NEXT RWANDA.


1067
1:14:37,5 --> 1:14:40,142
Goldhagen: IN JANUARY 2008,
A SPATE OF KILLINGS


1068
1:14:40,142 --> 1:14:44,646
FOLLOWED THE REELECTION
OF KENYAN PRESIDENT MWAI KIBAKI.


1069
1:14:44,646 --> 1:14:46,648
Man: CLEARLY, I THINK,
THE IMMEDIATE TRIGGER


1070
1:14:46,648 --> 1:14:50,252
FOR THAT VIOLENCE WAS
THE DISPUTED ELECTION
RESULTS THAT HAPPENED,


1071
1:14:50,252 --> 1:14:52,154
BUT BEYOND THAT, I THINK
THERE WERE ALSO


1072
1:14:52,154 --> 1:14:54,656
OTHER UNDERLYING ISSUES
THAT CAME TO THE FORE,


1073
1:14:54,656 --> 1:14:57,626
ISSUES OF DISCONTENTMENT,
ISSUES OF MARGINALIZATION,


1074
1:14:57,626 --> 1:15:0,61
RIFTS BETWEEN ETHNIC GROUPS
IN THE COUNTRY,


1075
1:15:0,61 --> 1:15:2,564
ISSUES OF LAND,
ISSUES OF HISTORICAL
INJUSTICES.


1076
1:15:2,564 --> 1:15:4,9
SO ALL THESE THINGS
CAME UP TOGETHER,


1077
1:15:4,9 --> 1:15:6,801
AND I THINK THAT
THE ELECTION RESULTS,


1078
1:15:6,801 --> 1:15:8,403
THE WAY IT WAS HANDLED,
THE PROCESS,


1079
1:15:8,403 --> 1:15:10,38
WAS REALLY LIKE THE MATCH
THAT WAS THROWN


1080
1:15:10,38 --> 1:15:11,72
INTO A BARREL OF OIL.


1081
1:15:11,72 --> 1:15:14,376
[SINGING IN NATIVE LANGUAGE]


1082
1:15:14,376 --> 1:15:17,879
Goldhagen: IN THE RIFT VALLEY,
MEMBERS OF THE PRESIDENT'S
TRIBE, THE KIKUYU,


1083
1:15:17,879 --> 1:15:19,414
WERE TARGETED.


1084
1:15:19,414 --> 1:15:21,616
1,500 OR MORE WERE KILLED,


1085
1:15:21,616 --> 1:15:31,96
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS
WERE EXPELLED FROM THEIR HOMES.


1086
1:15:31,96 --> 1:15:34,496
IF THE KIKUYU HAD
TRIED TO HOLD
THEIR GROUND,


1087
1:15:34,496 --> 1:15:36,498
WOULD THE VIOLENCE
HAVE ESCALATED


1088
1:15:36,498 --> 1:15:38,433
TO PRODUCE DEATHS
ON A MASSIVE SCALE?


1089
1:15:38,433 --> 1:15:40,635
ABSOLUTELY.
I THINK THE KILLINGS


1090
1:15:40,635 --> 1:15:42,103
WOULD HAVE
DEFINITELY INCREASED.


1091
1:15:42,103 --> 1:15:46,241
I THINK IT WOULD HAVE
DRAWN IN, ALSO,
MORE COMMUNITIES.


1092
1:15:46,241 --> 1:15:51,68
Goldhagen: WITHIN DAYS,
FORMER U.N. SECRETARY GENERAL
KOFI ANNAN HAD FLOWN TO NAIROBI


1093
1:15:51,68 --> 1:15:55,15
ALONG WITH REPRESENTATIVES
OF OTHER AFRICAN COUNTRIES.


1094
1:15:55,15 --> 1:16:0,722
I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT
THAT ALL KENYANS


1095
1:16:0,722 --> 1:16:5,393
RESPOND WITH SYMPATHY
AND UNDERSTANDING


1096
1:16:5,393 --> 1:16:7,495
AND NOT TRY TO REVENGE.


1097
1:16:7,495 --> 1:16:10,665
Goldhagen:
THE U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE
CONDOLEEZZA RICE ARRIVED


1098
1:16:10,665 --> 1:16:12,67
SOON AFTER.


1099
1:16:12,67 --> 1:16:14,135
THEY CAME TO MEDIATE,
TO PRESSURE,


1100
1:16:14,135 --> 1:16:15,737
AND WITH THREATS OF SANCTIONS.


1101
1:16:15,737 --> 1:16:17,505
Kiai: I DON'T THINK
I'VE EVER SEEN IN AFRICA


1102
1:16:17,505 --> 1:16:20,609
SUCH INTENSE
INTERNATIONAL ENGAGEMENT
ON AN ISSUE,


1103
1:16:20,609 --> 1:16:23,245
AND THAT REALLY HELPED.


1104
1:16:23,245 --> 1:16:25,814
Goldhagen: THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS
OF THE DIPLOMATIC INTERVENTION


1105
1:16:25,814 --> 1:16:28,116
IN KENYA REMAIN TO BE SEEN.


1106
1:16:28,116 --> 1:16:29,651
THE VIOLENCE STOPPED,


1107
1:16:29,651 --> 1:16:31,386
BUT THE RACISTS
AND POLITICAL ROOTS


1108
1:16:31,386 --> 1:16:33,121
OF THE CONFLICT RUN DEEP,


1109
1:16:33,121 --> 1:16:35,19
AND KENYAN POLITICAL LEADERS
COULD START UP


1110
1:16:35,19 --> 1:16:37,192
THE VIOLENCE AGAIN,


1111
1:16:37,192 --> 1:16:39,461
BUT THE IMMEDIATE RESPONSE
OF WORLD LEADERS


1112
1:16:39,461 --> 1:16:43,31
WAS A POWERFUL STATEMENT
AND THE KIND OF RAPID REACTION


1113
1:16:43,31 --> 1:16:49,4
THAT COULD SAVE MANY LIVES
IN THE FUTURE.


1114
1:16:49,4 --> 1:16:52,274
DIPLOMACY OF COURSE
DOES NOT ALWAYS WORK.


1115
1:16:52,274 --> 1:16:54,576
Christiane Amanpour:
THE U.N. IS ACCUSING
THE SUDANESE GOVERNMENT


1116
1:16:54,576 --> 1:16:58,98
OF RESUMING BOMBING RAIDS
AGAINST REBELS IN SOUTH DARFUR,


1117
1:16:58,98 --> 1:17:2,25
AND IT ALSO SAYS THAT
DISPLACED VILLAGERS LIKE THESE


1118
1:17:2,25 --> 1:17:7,22
ARE STILL BEING ATTACKED
BY JANJAWEED MILITIA.


1119
1:17:7,22 --> 1:17:8,723
Goldhagen: WHEN THE SUDANESE
GOVERNMENT WAS MURDERING


1120
1:17:8,723 --> 1:17:11,526
ITS OWN PEOPLE IN THE WESTERN
REGION OF DARFUR,


1121
1:17:11,526 --> 1:17:16,831
WORLD LEADERS SENT ENVOYS
TO KHARTOUM.


1122
1:17:16,831 --> 1:17:33,481
BUT THE OIL-RICH REGIME CARES
LITTLE ABOUT WORLD OPINION.


1123
1:17:33,481 --> 1:17:34,849
THEY CONTINUE TO KILL,


1124
1:17:34,849 --> 1:17:41,589
AND THE WORLD HAS DONE
NOTHING MEANINGFUL TO STOP THEM.


1125
1:17:41,589 --> 1:17:44,25
WE NEED TO STOP PROVING
TO POLITICAL LEADERS


1126
1:17:44,25 --> 1:17:48,96
THAT WE WILL STAND BY AS THEY
SLAUGHTER THEIR OWN PEOPLE.


1127
1:17:48,96 --> 1:17:51,333
IF DIPLOMACY FAILS, COUNTRIES
COMMITTING MASS ELIMINATIONS


1128
1:17:51,333 --> 1:17:54,569
SUCH AS SUDAN HAVE TO BE KICKED
OUT OF THE U.N.


1129
1:17:54,569 --> 1:17:57,439
AND ALL INTERNATIONAL
ORGANIZATIONS,


1130
1:17:57,439 --> 1:18:0,675
AND ALL TRADE MUST BE CUT OFF.


1131
1:18:0,675 --> 1:18:3,411
LEADERS THAT CONTINUE TO KILL
MUST KNOW THAT WE WILL


1132
1:18:3,411 --> 1:18:10,485
SWIFTLY AND FORCEFULLY DESTROY
THEIR MILITARY CAPABILITY.


1133
1:18:10,485 --> 1:18:13,421
Felde: SOME PEOPLE HAVE
TALKED ABOUT SOME KIND
OF RAPID RESPONSE FORCE.


1134
1:18:13,421 --> 1:18:16,157
I WOULD OF COURSE
BE FOR INTERVENTION,


1135
1:18:16,157 --> 1:18:19,27
MILITARY INTERVENTION
WHEN PEOPLE ARE
BEING SLAUGHTERED.


1136
1:18:19,27 --> 1:18:21,529
IT SEEMS QUITE OBVIOUS
THAT HAVING SOME KIND
OF FORCE


1137
1:18:21,529 --> 1:18:24,232
THAT COULD INTERVENE
RAPIDLY AND EFFECTIVELY


1138
1:18:24,232 --> 1:18:26,67
IN MANY OF THE COUNTRIES
WHERE IT DOESN'T TAKE


1139
1:18:26,67 --> 1:18:28,36
A GREAT DEAL OF FORCE
TO STOP THESE THINGS


1140
1:18:28,36 --> 1:18:31,39
IS AN ABSOLUTE MORAL
AND POLITICAL NECESSITY.


1141
1:18:31,39 --> 1:18:36,177
SOME WOULD SAY THAT IF
WE'RE GOING TO INTERVENE
MILITARILY IN DARFUR


1142
1:18:36,177 --> 1:18:37,345
WHAT ABOUT CONGO?


1143
1:18:37,345 --> 1:18:38,513
CERTAINLY, MORE PEOPLE
HAVE DIED THERE


1144
1:18:38,513 --> 1:18:39,714
IN THE PAST 10 YEARS.


1145
1:18:39,714 --> 1:18:41,483
SO PERHAPS THEN
YOU'RE SUGGESTING


1146
1:18:41,483 --> 1:18:43,351
WE SHOULD INTERVENE
THERE, AS WELL.


1147
1:18:43,351 --> 1:18:47,55
THESE KINDS
OF ARGUMENTS I ALSO
FIND UNPERSUASIVE.


1148
1:18:47,55 --> 1:18:49,357
IT IS QUITE TRUE THAT
THE UNITED STATES IS NOT


1149
1:18:49,357 --> 1:18:50,492
THE POLICEMAN
OF THE WORLD,


1150
1:18:50,492 --> 1:18:51,893
EVEN THOUGH IT IS
THE GUARANTOR


1151
1:18:51,893 --> 1:18:53,661
OF MUCH OF ORDER
IN THE WORLD.


1152
1:18:53,661 --> 1:18:55,864
IT REMAINS THAT,
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN


1153
1:18:55,864 --> 1:18:57,599
THAT IF INTERVENING
IN DARFUR IS


1154
1:18:57,599 --> 1:18:59,768
THE RIGHT THING TO DO
TO SAVE LIVES


1155
1:18:59,768 --> 1:19:2,57
THAT WE SHOULD NOT DO IT
BECAUSE WE CAN'T
INTERVENE EVERYWHERE.


1156
1:19:2,57 --> 1:19:6,174
I DON'T FIND
THE ARGUMENTS AGAIN
PERSUASIVE THAT,


1157
1:19:6,174 --> 1:19:9,31
WELL, YOU SHOULDN'T
DO SOMETHING BECAUSE
YOU CAN'T DO EVERYTHING.


1158
1:19:9,31 --> 1:19:12,18
OUR PROBLEM IS THAT WE
DO LITTLE OR NOTHING
AT ALL.


1159
1:19:12,18 --> 1:19:13,882
Silajdzic:
THE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY MUST HAVE


1160
1:19:13,882 --> 1:19:19,821
A MECHANISM THAT
WILL QUICKLY REACT
TO GENOCIDE.


1161
1:19:19,821 --> 1:19:21,389
THERE IS NO
WAITING THERE,


1162
1:19:21,389 --> 1:19:23,892
THERE IS NO
OTHER CONSIDERATION.


1163
1:19:23,892 --> 1:19:25,96
HUMAN LIFE
MUST BE SAVED.


1164
1:19:25,96 --> 1:19:27,862
WE MUST ALL AGREE
TO THIS.


1165
1:19:27,862 --> 1:19:29,864
IF THERE IS
MASS KILLING
SOMEWHERE,


1166
1:19:29,864 --> 1:19:32,167
THE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY HAS
THE RIGHT


1167
1:19:32,167 --> 1:19:37,205
TO INTERVENE.


1168
1:19:37,205 --> 1:19:40,642
YOU KNOW, WHEN IT
BECOMES TOO LATE,
IT'S TOO LATE.


1169
1:19:40,642 --> 1:19:43,178
Man: IN MANY INSTANCES,
DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS


1170
1:19:43,178 --> 1:19:44,879
ARE GONNA BE
UNSUCCESSFUL,


1171
1:19:44,879 --> 1:19:47,148
PARTICULARLY ONCE
THE KILLING STARTS.


1172
1:19:47,148 --> 1:19:48,783
THE ONLY WAY YOU ARE
GONNA STOP THAT


1173
1:19:48,783 --> 1:19:50,652
IS THROUGH THE USE
OF MILITARY FORCE,


1174
1:19:50,652 --> 1:19:52,687
BUT IT'S GONNA BE
VERY DIFFICULT


1175
1:19:52,687 --> 1:19:57,91
TO GET A WIDE CONSORTIUM
OF COUNTRIES TO AGREE


1176
1:19:57,91 --> 1:19:58,293
THAT THERE'S
AN AUTOMATIC TRIGGER


1177
1:19:58,293 --> 1:20:0,128
FOR MILITARY
INTERVENTION.


1178
1:20:0,128 --> 1:20:4,65
IN DARFUR, YOU NEED
AFRICAN GOVERNMENTS
ON BOARD,


1179
1:20:4,65 --> 1:20:6,267
YOU NEED MIDDLE EASTERN
GOVERNMENTS ON BOARD.


1180
1:20:6,267 --> 1:20:7,902
THIS HAS PROVED
VERY DIFFICULT
TO ACCOMPLISH.


1181
1:20:7,902 --> 1:20:11,206
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT A DIPLOMAT,
AND I SAY WHY?


1182
1:20:11,206 --> 1:20:12,74
WHY DO WE NEED THEM
ON BOARD?


1183
1:20:12,74 --> 1:20:17,745
I MEAN, YOU HAVE
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS
OF PEOPLE BEING SLAUGHTERED.


1184
1:20:17,745 --> 1:20:20,281
WHY DO WE NEED TO GET
MIDDLE EASTERN GOVERNMENTS


1185
1:20:20,281 --> 1:20:21,549
OR AFRICAN GOVERNMENTS
ON BOARD?


1186
1:20:21,549 --> 1:20:23,985
WHY NOT CREATE
A NO-FLY ZONE,


1187
1:20:23,985 --> 1:20:26,2
WHY NOT BOMB THEIR
MILITARY INSTALLATIONS?


1188
1:20:26,2 --> 1:20:27,689
FORGET ABOUT THE DIPLOMACY
FOR A MINUTE.


1189
1:20:27,689 --> 1:20:31,926
WOULD IT BE EFFECTIVE,
AND THEN HOW DO WE WEIGH
IF IT WOULD BE


1190
1:20:31,926 --> 1:20:34,863
THE MORALITY OF IT
VERSUS THE DIPLOMACY OF IT?


1191
1:20:34,863 --> 1:20:37,298
FROM THE MORAL
PERSPECTIVE, YOU'RE
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.


1192
1:20:37,298 --> 1:20:38,733
I MEAN, WE DO HAVE
A MORAL OBLIGATION.


1193
1:20:38,733 --> 1:20:41,736
IF WE'RE
IN A POSITION TO ACT


1194
1:20:41,736 --> 1:20:44,772
AND WE HAVE THE ACTUAL
CAPABILITY TO DO SO,


1195
1:20:44,772 --> 1:20:46,274
THEN I THINK WE SHOULD,


1196
1:20:46,274 --> 1:20:48,676
BUT IF YOU HAVE
A SITUATION WHERE YOU'RE


1197
1:20:48,676 --> 1:20:51,946
NOT ABLE TO GET SUPPORT
OF OTHER GOVERNMENTS,


1198
1:20:51,946 --> 1:20:54,449
IT MAY BE
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE.


1199
1:20:54,449 --> 1:20:55,984
Goldhagen: GETTING THE SUPPORT
OF OTHER GOVERNMENTS


1200
1:20:55,984 --> 1:20:58,553
SOUNDS GOOD,
BUT AS HARIS SILAJDZIC


1201
1:20:58,553 --> 1:21:1,422
EXPERIENCED DURING THE DAYS
OF THE BOSNIAN GENOCIDE,


1202
1:21:1,422 --> 1:21:3,691
CONVINCING LEADERS
TO INTERVENE MILITARILY


1203
1:21:3,691 --> 1:21:5,727
IS EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT.


1204
1:21:5,727 --> 1:21:8,363
WHAT WAS IT LIKE
FOR YOU TRYING TO MOBILIZE


1205
1:21:8,363 --> 1:21:11,633
THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY,
THE POLITICAL LEADERS


1206
1:21:11,633 --> 1:21:14,269
OF THE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES,
OF THE UNITED STATES,


1207
1:21:14,269 --> 1:21:17,639
THE U.N., AND SO ON
TO DO SOMETHING?


1208
1:21:17,639 --> 1:21:22,176
WELL, THAT IS
VERY FRUSTRATING,
THE POWERLESSNESS,


1209
1:21:22,176 --> 1:21:23,745
VERY FRUSTRATING.


1210
1:21:23,745 --> 1:21:25,88
IT'S HARD TO MOVE
THE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY


1211
1:21:25,88 --> 1:21:27,549
TO REALLY DO SOMETHING.


1212
1:21:27,549 --> 1:21:32,287
IT'S THE PHILOSOPHY

1:35:19,88 --> 1:35:24,918
THEY ARE
RATIONAL CALCULATORS
OF COSTS AND BENEFITS.


1382
1:35:24,918 --> 1:35:25,986
AFTER ALL,
THESE PEOPLE HAVE RISEN


1383
1:35:25,986 --> 1:35:27,855
TO THE PINNACLE OF POWER
IN THEIR COUNTRIES,


1384
1:35:27,855 --> 1:35:29,256
AND SO WHAT WE NEED
TO DO IS THINK


1385
1:35:29,256 --> 1:35:33,961
ABOUT THEIR
COST-BENEFIT CALCULUS.


1386
1:35:33,961 --> 1:35:36,196
LIKE RÍOS MONTT,
ALL POLITICAL LEADERS


1387
1:35:36,196 --> 1:35:39,266
WHO INITIATE
GENOCIDES AND ELIMINATIONS


1388
1:35:39,266 --> 1:35:41,168
KNOW THAT
THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY


1389
1:35:41,168 --> 1:35:44,838
IS UNLIKELY TO INTERFERE
WITH THEIR DEADLY PLANS.


1390
1:35:44,838 --> 1:35:48,609
Woman: THIS IS CASE NUMBER
IT-95-5/18-I,


1391
1:35:48,609 --> 1:35:51,44
THE PROSECUTOR
VERSUS RADOVAN KARADZIC.


1392
1:35:51,44 --> 1:35:52,713
Goldhagen: WE HAVE
INTERNATIONAL COURTS,


1393
1:35:52,713 --> 1:35:54,415
AND THEY DO SOME GOOD,


1394
1:35:54,415 --> 1:35:57,718
BUT THEY ARE UNBEARABLY
SLOW AND INEFFECTIVE...


1395
1:35:57,718 --> 1:35:59,386
Man: GOOD AFTERNOON,
YOUR HONOR.


1396
1:35:59,386 --> 1:36:4,625
AND THE KILLING CONTINUES.


1397
1:36:4,625 --> 1:36:8,162
SO WHAT SHOULD WE DO?


1398
1:36:8,162 --> 1:36:10,464
FROM THE TRAGEDIES
IN RWANDA AND ELSEWHERE,


1399
1:36:10,464 --> 1:36:12,733
WE'VE SEEN THAT
THE INSTITUTIONS WE RELY ON


1400
1:36:12,733 --> 1:36:15,536
TO COMBAT GENOCIDE DON'T WORK,


1401
1:36:15,536 --> 1:36:18,705
AND IT'S CLEAR THAT AS IN KENYA
TIMELY INTERVENTION


1402
1:36:18,705 --> 1:36:20,307
CAN GET POLITICAL LEADERS


1403
1:36:20,307 --> 1:36:24,178
TO STOP
THE ELIMINATIONIST ASSAULT.


1404
1:36:24,178 --> 1:36:27,648
IN DEALING WITH A RECALCITRANT
GENOCIDAL LEADER IN DARFUR,


1405
1:36:27,648 --> 1:36:30,83
WE'VE LEARNED THAT
TO BE EFFECTIVE


1406
1:36:30,83 --> 1:36:33,52
INTERVENTION MUST OFTEN
BE FORCEFUL


1407
1:36:33,52 --> 1:36:36,29
AND THAT, AS WAS
THE CASE IN BOSNIA,


1408
1:36:36,29 --> 1:36:42,296
RELATIVELY LITTLE FORCE CAN
ACHIEVE EXTRAORDINARY RESULTS,


1409
1:36:42,296 --> 1:36:46,66
AND WE KNOW ABOVE ALL
THAT GENOCIDES ARE POLITICAL


1410
1:36:46,66 --> 1:36:48,569
AND THEY ARE INITIATED
BY A FEW LEADERS


1411
1:36:48,569 --> 1:36:54,74
WHOSE COST-BENEFIT CALCULATIONS
CAN BE CHANGED.


1412
1:36:54,74 --> 1:36:57,778
WE NEED TO CHANGE
THAT CALCULATION.


1413
1:36:57,778 --> 1:37:0,347
Goldhagen: DO WE NEED TO
HAVE A NEW INTERNATIONAL
ORIENTATION


1414
1:37:0,347 --> 1:37:2,916
TOWARDS INTERVENTION
AND GENOCIDE?


1415
1:37:2,916 --> 1:37:4,251
DEFINITELY.


1416
1:37:4,251 --> 1:37:5,619
HOW WOULD YOU REWRITE
THE RULES


1417
1:37:5,619 --> 1:37:9,423
OF THE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY ON THIS?


1418
1:37:9,423 --> 1:37:15,128
FIRST, GENOCIDE
NEVER HAPPENS
AS A SURPRISE.


1419
1:37:15,128 --> 1:37:19,867
NEVER.


1420
1:37:19,867 --> 1:37:25,506
THE SIGNS ARE
USUALLY AVAILABLE
AND APPARENT,


1421
1:37:25,506 --> 1:37:30,41
AND SO THERE SHOULD
BE A DEBATE


1422
1:37:30,41 --> 1:37:34,248
AT THE U.N.
SECURITY COUNCIL,


1423
1:37:34,248 --> 1:37:37,317
AT THE LEVEL
OF THE EUROPEAN
UNION,


1424
1:37:37,317 --> 1:37:38,652
AT THE LEVEL
OF AFRICAN UNION,


1425
1:37:38,652 --> 1:37:43,29
OR OTHER
POWERBROKERS


1426
1:37:43,29 --> 1:37:48,95
TO SET UNDER
WHICH CIRCUMSTANCES


1427
1:37:48,95 --> 1:37:52,533
INTERVENTION WOULD
BE DEEMED NECESSARY.


1428
1:37:52,533 --> 1:37:55,569
SO YOU DON'T
WAIT UNTIL IT
HAS HAPPENED.


1429
1:37:55,569 --> 1:37:57,838
THERE MUST BE
PREVENTIVE MEASURES.


1430
1:37:57,838 --> 1:38:1,775
SO I THINK WE
SHOULD GO BACK TO
THE DRAWING BOARD.


1431
1:38:1,775 --> 1:38:4,444
Goldhagen, voice-over: BACK
TO THE DRAWING BOARD INDEED.


1432
1:38:4,444 --> 1:38:8,582
GIVEN EVERYTHING I'VE
SEEN AND STUDIED,
THIS MUCH IS CLEAR.


1433
1:38:8,582 --> 1:38:12,953
INSTEAD OF THE U.N.,
WE NEED AN INTERNATIONAL
WATCHDOG ORGANIZATION


1434
1:38:12,953 --> 1:38:16,123
MADE UP OF DEMOCRATIC NATIONS
THAT WILL ENFORCE


1435
1:38:16,123 --> 1:38:22,462
A ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY
ON GENOCIDE AND ELIMINATIONISM.


1436
1:38:22,462 --> 1:38:25,499
EACH OF THE MEMBERS MUST HAVE
THE RIGHT TO INTERVENE


1437
1:38:25,499 --> 1:38:27,534
INDIVIDUALLY OR COLLECTIVELY


1438
1:38:27,534 --> 1:38:30,704
TO STOP CAMPAIGNS
OF ELIMINATION,


1439
1:38:30,704 --> 1:38:33,774
BUT INTERVENTION,
EVEN FORCEFUL INTERVENTION,


1440
1:38:33,774 --> 1:38:35,375
IS NOT ENOUGH.


1441
1:38:35,375 --> 1:38:36,91
BY THE TIME WE INTERVENE,


1442
1:38:36,91 --> 1:38:39,947
TENS OF THOUSANDS
CAN BE DEAD OR HOMELESS.


1443
1:38:39,947 --> 1:38:43,617
WE NEED AN EFFECTIVE SYSTEM
OF PREVENTION.


1444
1:38:43,617 --> 1:38:46,353
WE'VE GOT TO STOP GENOCIDES
BEFORE THEY HAPPEN


1445
1:38:46,353 --> 1:38:48,889
BY SHOWING POLITICAL LEADERS
THAT THE COSTS TO THEM


1446
1:38:48,889 --> 1:38:53,493
WILL FOR SURE
FAR OUTWEIGH THE BENEFITS.


1447
1:38:53,493 --> 1:38:56,196
THE U.S. HAS A BOUNTY PROGRAM
FOR GETTING PEOPLE


1448
1:38:56,196 --> 1:38:58,31
TO HUNT DOWN TERRORISTS.


1449
1:38:58,31 --> 1:39:0,167
WHY NOT HAVE
DEMOCRATIC COUNTRIES DO THE SAME


1450
1:39:0,167 --> 1:39:3,804
FOR LEADERS WHO PERPETRATE
GENOCIDES AND ELIMINATIONS?


1451
1:39:3,804 --> 1:39:6,273
LET'S SAY FOR EXAMPLE,
THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY


1452
1:39:6,273 --> 1:39:9,176
DECLARED THE LEADERS
OF COUNTRIES
THAT COMMIT GENOCIDE


1453
1:39:9,176 --> 1:39:10,344
TO BE OUTLAWS.


1454
1:39:10,344 --> 1:39:13,547
THEY CAN BE HUNTED DOWN
UNTIL THEY EITHER


1455
1:39:13,547 --> 1:39:16,116
GIVE THEMSELVES UP
OR UNTIL THEY'RE KILLED.


1456
1:39:16,116 --> 1:39:17,751
WOULD MILOSEVIC
UNDER THESE CIRCUMSTANCES


1457
1:39:17,751 --> 1:39:22,155
HAVE EVER INITIATED
THE SLAUGHTER OF BOSNIANS?


1458
1:39:22,155 --> 1:39:23,657
I DON'T THINK
HE WOULD.


1459
1:39:23,657 --> 1:39:29,162
HE COUNTED
WITH POWERFUL
FRIENDS


1460
1:39:29,162 --> 1:39:32,232
AND MOST OF ALL
WITH THE FACTUAL
SITUATION


1461
1:39:32,232 --> 1:39:34,267
ON THE GROUND,
KNOWING THAT


1462
1:39:34,267 --> 1:39:38,939
THE INTERNATIONAL
COMMUNITY IS IN LOVE
WITH THE STATUS QUO.


1463
1:39:38,939 --> 1:39:42,509
WE MUST SHOW
THAT IT DOESN'T PAY.


1464
1:39:42,509 --> 1:39:48,248
IF PEOPLE KNEW
THAT AT THE END
OF THE DAY


1465
1:39:48,248 --> 1:39:50,517
THEY'D BE
THE LOSERS,


1466
1:39:50,517 --> 1:39:53,286
THEY WOULD
NEVER INVEST


1467
1:39:53,286 --> 1:39:55,188
IN A LOSING
ENTERPRISE.


1468
1:39:55,188 --> 1:39:57,391
IT'S BECAUSE
GENOCIDE IS
A POLITICAL GAME,


1469
1:39:57,391 --> 1:39:59,526
IT'S A POWER PLAY,
IT'S WORSE,


1470
1:39:59,526 --> 1:40:1,995
IT'S EVERYTHING.


1471
1:40:1,995 --> 1:40:7,3
IF PEOPLE INVOLVED
IN KNEW AT THE END
OF THE DAY


1472
1:40:7,3 --> 1:40:8,802
THEY'D BE
THE LOSERS,


1473
1:40:8,802 --> 1:40:13,674
THEY WOULD NOT
PLAY THE GAME,
THAT'S FOR SURE.


1474
1:40:13,674 --> 1:40:15,409
Goldhagen: WHAT IS
THE ALTERNATIVE TO DEALING


1475
1:40:15,409 --> 1:40:17,944
FORCEFULLY
WITH GENOCIDAL LEADERS?


1476
1:40:17,944 --> 1:40:19,579
THE STATUS QUO,


1477
1:40:19,579 --> 1:40:26,286
MORE MASS MURDER,
MORE LIVES DESTROYED.


1478
1:40:26,286 --> 1:40:30,323
THE KEY TO STOPPING GENOCIDE
IS TO FOCUS ON THE LEADERS.


1479
1:40:30,323 --> 1:40:34,361
THE KEY TO GETTING US TO ACT IS
TO IDENTIFY WITH THE VICTIMS,


1480
1:40:34,361 --> 1:40:36,663
TO THINK OF EACH ONE
AS IF HE OR SHE WERE


1481
1:40:36,663 --> 1:40:40,1
YOUR DAUGHTER OR SON,
YOUR SISTER OR BROTHER,


1482
1:40:40,1 --> 1:40:42,102
YOUR MOTHER
OR YOUR FATHER.


1483
1:40:42,102 --> 1:40:48,241
WE'RE GONNA "T"
INTO CAR--CAR--
CARMEN--


1484
1:40:48,241 --> 1:40:49,576

HOW TO READ IT.

1:40:49,576 --> 1:40:51,878
Goldhagen, voice-over:
MY JOURNEY ENDS WITH MY FATHER


1486
1:40:51,878 --> 1:40:54,614
AT THE PLACE WHERE HIS BEGAN.


1487
1:40:54,614 --> 1:40:59,319
SHORTLY AFTER THE GERMANS
AND THE ROMANIAN ALLIES
ENTERED MY FATHER'S TOWN,


1488
1:40:59,319 --> 1:41:1,888
THEY SLAUGHTERED 800 JEWS.


1489
1:41:1,888 --> 1:41:4,558
MY FATHER AND HIS FAMILY
WERE NEARLY EXECUTED


1490
1:41:4,558 --> 1:41:6,96
ON A DIRT ROAD
BEHIND THEIR HOUSE


1491
1:41:6,96 --> 1:41:12,766
SOMEWHERE IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.


1492
1:41:12,766 --> 1:41:13,834
DO YOU SEE
ANY TRACKS?


1493
1:41:13,834 --> 1:41:16,336
THEY SHOULD BE
STRAIGHT AHEAD.


1494
1:41:16,336 --> 1:41:18,205
IF WE END HERE,
THE TRACKS SHOULD
BE RIGHT DOWN HERE.


1495
1:41:18,205 --> 1:41:20,941
HERE THEY ARE.


1496
1:41:20,941 --> 1:41:22,342
TATI, SEE
THE TRACKS?


1497
1:41:22,342 --> 1:41:23,677
I DON'T KNOW.
DO YOU SEE THEM?


1498
1:41:23,677 --> 1:41:24,911
YES, THEY'RE
RIGHT THERE.


1499
1:41:24,911 --> 1:41:26,88
OH, I SEE.
YEAH. THAT WAS HERE.


1500
1:41:26,88 --> 1:41:34,621
I LIVED RIGHT HERE.


1501
1:41:34,621 --> 1:41:37,924
I RAN OUT WITH MY
FATHER BEYOND
FROM THERE.


1502
1:41:37,924 --> 1:41:39,25
OUT THE OTHER SIDE?


1503
1:41:39,25 --> 1:41:41,361
YES. I REMEMBER WE
RAN OVER A FENCE,


1504
1:41:41,361 --> 1:41:43,363
AND AS WE WERE
RUNNING, A SOLDIER
SPIED US


1505
1:41:43,363 --> 1:41:44,831
AND BEAT MY FATHER
VERY SEVERELY


1506
1:41:44,831 --> 1:41:46,333
WITH THE BUTT
OF HIS RIFLE


1507
1:41:46,333 --> 1:41:48,101
AND PUT US AGAINST--
SAID, "WAIT HERE,"


1508
1:41:48,101 --> 1:41:50,637
PUT US AGAINST--
OF COURSE THERE
WAS A FENCE--


1509
1:41:50,637 --> 1:41:52,139
AGAINST THE FENCE,


1510
1:41:52,139 --> 1:41:58,845
AND THEN HE TOLD ME
TO TELL THE FAMILY
TO COME--


1511
1:41:58,845 --> 1:41:59,846
TO COME OUT.


1512
1:41:59,846 --> 1:42:0,847
SO HE SENT YOU BACK
TO THE HOUSE?


1513
1:42:0,847 --> 1:42:2,215
HE SENT ME
BACK TO THE HOUSE,


1514
1:42:2,215 --> 1:42:7,387
AND WE SAW NEIGHBORS
STANDING BEYOND
THIS RAILWAY,


1515
1:42:7,387 --> 1:42:10,39
AND WE REALIZED
THAT THEY'RE
LOOKING AT US


1516
1:42:10,39 --> 1:42:14,995
IN A CERTAIN WAY
THAT THEY--
IN AN OMINOUS WAY.


1517
1:42:14,995 --> 1:42:24,7
THEY--WHICH DIDN'T--
WHICH DIDN'T BODE WELL,
TO SAY THE LEAST.


1518
1:42:24,7 --> 1:42:26,94
NOW THAT WE'RE HERE,
IS THIS--HAS IT
CHANGED YOUR VIEW?


1519
1:42:26,94 --> 1:42:29,509
YOU SEE, THE POINT IS
THAT THE SCHOLARLY ELEMENT--


1520
1:42:29,509 --> 1:42:33,68
THE SCHOLAR WITHIN ME
IMMEDIATELY TAKES OVER THE--


1521
1:42:33,68 --> 1:42:38,985
AND OVERSHADOWS
THE EMOTIONS
OF THE SURVIVOR


1522
1:42:38,985 --> 1:42:42,622
WHO REVISITS THE SCENE
OF HIS NEAR DEATH.


1523
1:42:42,622 --> 1:42:46,86
SO AS I TALK TO YOU,
I BEGIN TO REFLECT,


1524
1:42:46,86 --> 1:42:49,95
DRAW HISTORICAL ANALOGIES,
AND SO ON,


1525
1:42:49,95 --> 1:42:52,332
SO THEREFORE,
IT HAS A CERTAIN
TEMPERING EFFECT


1526
1:42:52,332 --> 1:42:54,501

AS I CONFRONT

WHERE I WALKED,


1529
1:42:57,571 --> 1:43:3,109
AND REFLECTED ON MY BLOOD
LYING IN THE DUST HERE,


1530
1:43:3,109 --> 1:43:6,58
BUT WHEN I REMEMBER
THAT MOMENT
AS I WALKED


1531
1:43:6,58 --> 1:43:8,315
AND I JUST COULDN'T
BELIEVE--


1532
1:43:8,315 --> 1:43:12,485
YES, I DID REFLECT
UPON HOW I WOULD LIE DEAD.


1533
1:43:12,485 --> 1:43:14,821
WHAT DOES IT MEAN
TO BE DEAD


1534
1:43:14,821 --> 1:43:17,357
AND TO LIE
IN YOUR BLOOD?


1535
1:43:17,357 --> 1:43:39,346

AS I WALKED, AND...

Goldhagen, voice-over:
I HAD BEEN WORKING
ON "WORSE THAN WAR"


1570
1:46:45,665 --> 1:46:50,603
FOR ABOUT 10 YEARS BEFORE
THE FILM PROJECT BEGAN.


1571
1:46:50,603 --> 1:46:52,906
WHEN I WRITE A BOOK,
I CAN PRETTY MUCH SAY
WHATEVER I WANT TO,


1572
1:46:52,906 --> 1:46:55,575
AND IF I DECIDE SOMETHING
NEEDS 20 PAGES OF ELABORATION,


1573
1:46:55,575 --> 1:46:56,776
THEN I DO IT.


1574
1:46:56,776 --> 1:46:58,278
EVEN THOUGH I HAD THOUGHT
AT THE BEGINNING,


1575
1:46:58,278 --> 1:47:1,181
"WELL, I KNOW WHAT
THIS FILM SHOULD SAY,"


1576
1:47:1,181 --> 1:47:2,615

AND INFINITELY BETTER
THAN ANYTHING


1578
1:47:4,284 --> 1:47:8,221
I WOULD HAVE PRODUCED
HAD I BEEN THE FILMMAKER


1579
1:47:8,221 --> 1:47:11,24

PRODUCED A NICE TWO-HOUR LECTURE

1584
1:47:21,101 --> 1:47:26,206
IN SOME WAYS
OBVIOUSLY MORE POWERFUL.

AND GIDEON OUR SON CAME WITH US.

WAS 7 YEARS OLD,

HE'S VERY CLOSE MY PARENTS.

1590
1:47:42,522 --> 1:47:45,625
HE WAS DEEPLY INTERESTED IN
GOING TO WHERE GRANDPA WAS FROM.

SO THEY CAME
ON THE TRIP WITH US,


1592

AND IT WAS SOMETHING THAT MADE
MY FATHER ENORMOUSLY HAPPY.


1593
1:47:51,931 --> 1:47:54,434
THAT ONE OF HIS GRANDCHILDREN
COULD SEE WHERE


1594

AND WHERE HE SUFFERED

1596
1:47:58,838 --> 1:48:1,674

IF ONE CAN SAY SUCH A THING,


1597
1:48:1,674 --> 1:48:12,719
TWICE AS MOVING AND MEMORABLE
AND MEANINGFUL FOR HIM.


1598
1:48:12,719 --> 1:48:15,155
THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT
MY FATHER INFLUENCED


1599
1:48:15,155 --> 1:48:19,125
MY INITIAL DIRECTION
OF WORKING ON THE HOLOCAUST,


1600
1:48:19,125 --> 1:48:20,827
BUT IT'S LESS BECAUSE
HE WAS A SURVIVOR


1601
1:48:20,827 --> 1:48:23,429
THAN HE WAS A PROFESSOR
WHO STUDIED THIS,


1602
1:48:23,429 --> 1:48:25,632
AND I GREW UP
WITH THIS MATERIAL IN MY HOME


1603

ALWAYS WITH THE PURPOSE
NOT OF TELLING A TALE OF WOE,


1604

WHICH IT IS,
BUT OF UNDERSTANDING
AND EXPLAINING.

OR DISCUSSING IT,

TO ONE OF THE PRISON CAMPS.

1:49:28,394 --> 1:49:33,266
IT'S ACTUALLY A WORK CAMP
FOR PRISONERS WHO CONFESSED


1621
1:49:33,266 --> 1:49:35,335
TO THEIR CRIMES,
OR AT LEAST SOME CRIMES,


1622
1:49:35,335 --> 1:49:38,705
TO CONFESS TO HAVING
PARTICIPATED IN THE GENOCIDE.


1623
1:49:38,705 --> 1:49:41,507
IF YOU CAN BELIEVE THAT,
THERE ARE ABOUT 1,000 PEOPLE
IN THIS PRISON.


1624
1:49:41,507 --> 1:49:43,376
THERE WERE NO GUARDS.

AND PICKS AND MACHETES,

FOR WHAT HIS NAME IS,

IT'S A TIME
OF HUMAN SHARING,


1643
1:50:32,625 --> 1:50:34,56
AND YET THAT SAME HAND--
I SHAKE THE HAND.


1644
1:50:34,56 --> 1:50:40,266
I THINK THE SAME HAND ACTUALLY
WAS WIELDING A MACHETE

AND STRIKING AND KILLING


1646
1:50:42,568 --> 1:50:45,938

AND YOU CAN'T FLINCH,


1648
1:50:48,908 --> 1:50:51,577
AND YOU CAN'T SAY,
"I DON'T WANT TO DO IT,"


1649
1:50:51,577 --> 1:50:54,414
AND YOU HAVE TO DO IT
BECAUSE IT'S PART


1650
1:50:54,414 --> 1:50:56,582
OF WHAT YOU NEED TO DO
WHEN YOU INTERVIEW SOMEBODY,


1651
1:50:56,582 --> 1:50:59,385
AND THAT'S JUST THE BEGINNING
OF SITTING ACROSS FROM SOMEONE


1652
1:50:59,385 --> 1:51:1,988
WHO THEN BEGINS TO TELL YOU
OF THE HORRIBLE THINGS,


1653
1:51:1,988 --> 1:51:3,923

THAT HE DID,
