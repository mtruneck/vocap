0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:6,41



2
0:0:6,41 --> 0:0:8,119
DAN SANTORO: I grew up in
Woodbridge, New Jersey.


3
0:0:8,119 --> 0:0:10,426
I was paying for community
college and it wasn't much, it


4
0:0:10,426 --> 0:0:11,995
was like $800 a semester.


5
0:0:11,995 --> 0:0:15,46
And to me it was like, what a
waste of my fucking money.


6
0:0:15,46 --> 0:0:19,19
So I dropped out and then I
started working as a sign


7
0:0:19,19 --> 0:0:23,34
painter for Wegmans in upstate
New York, sort of gourmet


8
0:0:23,34 --> 0:0:24,15
grocery store.


9
0:0:24,15 --> 0:0:25,69
And they were looking
for someone to do


10
0:0:25,69 --> 0:0:27,16
hand painted signs.


11
0:0:27,16 --> 0:0:31,5
I had all these countless
amounts of like paint markers


12
0:0:31,5 --> 0:0:32,439
and stuff at my disposal.


13
0:0:32,439 --> 0:0:34,81
So I would just come in and then
I'd spend the rest of the


14
0:0:34,81 --> 0:0:37,25
day drawing friends' tattoos
too at the time.


15
0:0:37,25 --> 0:0:40,86
Like a lot of people were having
friends be like, oh Dan


16
0:0:40,86 --> 0:0:43,61
draws, you know like
draw me that tree.


17
0:0:43,61 --> 0:0:49,76



18
0:0:49,76 --> 0:0:51,7
BERT KRAK: Well we've all
been friends with


19
0:0:51,7 --> 0:0:52,91
Dan for a long time.


20
0:0:52,91 --> 0:0:56,33
I kind of always knew that
eventually we would work


21
0:0:56,33 --> 0:1:1,0
together because he has the same
ideas all of us as far as


22
0:1:1,0 --> 0:1:3,65
what a tattoo should
look like.


23
0:1:3,65 --> 0:1:7,93
He really enjoys painting
and creating new stuff.


24
0:1:7,93 --> 0:1:10,4
We don't want to keep pulling
the same things out of the


25
0:1:10,4 --> 0:1:11,36
same books.


26
0:1:11,36 --> 0:1:14,54
But if we take those same
things and repaint them


27
0:1:14,54 --> 0:1:17,33
ourselves, well then it kind
of does become a different


28
0:1:17,33 --> 0:1:18,76
thing, it becomes our own.


29
0:1:18,76 --> 0:1:21,33



30
0:1:21,33 --> 0:1:23,54
I say this is how we keep
our skills sharp.


31
0:1:23,54 --> 0:1:32,67



32
0:1:32,67 --> 0:1:34,46
STEVE BOLTZ: You know the flash
at Smith Street, there's


33
0:1:34,46 --> 0:1:36,81
certain shops, aesthetics,
obviously that


34
0:1:36,81 --> 0:1:38,7
we're trying to emulate.


35
0:1:38,7 --> 0:1:40,82
The whole idea of it being
crushed in flash is like-- and


36
0:1:40,82 --> 0:1:43,92
that's a more old school
approach to a tattoo shop.


37
0:1:43,92 --> 0:1:48,1
Well there was a shop in China
called Swallow Tattoo, there's


38
0:1:48,1 --> 0:1:49,57
photos of this guy Swallow.


39
0:1:49,57 --> 0:1:52,9
He was a Chinese tattooer
standing in the shop.


40
0:1:52,9 --> 0:1:54,9
And I mean everything is covered
in flash, I mean like


41
0:1:54,9 --> 0:1:58,65
the front of everything, little
spots, like this little


42
0:1:58,65 --> 0:2:0,93
side of the fridge would have
designs all down it,


43
0:2:0,93 --> 0:2:2,91
everything was covered
in flash.


44
0:2:2,91 --> 0:2:4,5
I just think it's such
a good look.


45
0:2:4,5 --> 0:2:6,94
I mean obviously you're
in a tattoo shop, it


46
0:2:6,94 --> 0:2:8,8
should look like that.


47
0:2:8,8 --> 0:2:9,33
You know what I mean?


48
0:2:9,33 --> 0:2:11,17



49
0:2:11,17 --> 0:2:14,63
I think that place is kind of
exactly what we want Smith


50
0:2:14,63 --> 0:2:15,45
Street to look like.


51
0:2:15,45 --> 0:2:18,76
So that anywhere you turn, you
see a tattoo design, and then


52
0:2:18,76 --> 0:2:21,82
are still thinking
about tattoos.


53
0:2:21,82 --> 0:2:24,16
Like tattoo heads get it, or
they understand this is hand


54
0:2:24,16 --> 0:2:28,7
painted Flash, and that there is
sort of tattooing revival.


55
0:2:28,7 --> 0:2:31,43
But like regular people who just
walk into the shop, like


56
0:2:31,43 --> 0:2:34,47
I think to them it's sort
of run of the mill.


57
0:2:34,47 --> 0:2:37,3
And actually we get reggies in
there sometimes and say that,


58
0:2:37,3 --> 0:2:39,54
like this is all hand painted
by the four of us.


59
0:2:39,54 --> 0:2:41,14
And they can't even wrap
their heads around it.


60
0:2:41,14 --> 0:2:43,6
Like what do you mean,
like you painted it?


61
0:2:43,6 --> 0:2:44,45
What do you mean
you painted it?


62
0:2:44,45 --> 0:2:47,71
Like with a brush and paper,
they can't even fathom that.


63
0:2:47,71 --> 0:2:54,87



64
0:2:54,87 --> 0:2:57,29
DAN SANTORO: This whole wall
at this point is 100% us.


65
0:2:57,29 --> 0:2:59,81
Like this set, which actually
turned out to be this entire


66
0:2:59,81 --> 0:3:1,98
row, Eli had done
the first three.


67
0:3:1,98 --> 0:3:5,39
He had done the parrots, the
eagles, and I think the owl.


68
0:3:5,39 --> 0:3:8,21
So he did these little triptychs
of like three


69
0:3:8,21 --> 0:3:9,1
different birds.


70
0:3:9,1 --> 0:3:11,16
And then Steve kind of followed
his lead I think


71
0:3:11,16 --> 0:3:13,5
first, if I'm not mistaken.


72
0:3:13,5 --> 0:3:14,15
Right?


73
0:3:14,15 --> 0:3:16,5
So then he did like these sets
of pin-ups, and then I


74
0:3:16,5 --> 0:3:19,12
followed him, and then
Burt, and so on.


75
0:3:19,12 --> 0:3:23,27
I did the roses, Burt did
the geishas, and Eli did


76
0:3:23,27 --> 0:3:24,52
crosses, and so on.


77
0:3:24,52 --> 0:3:26,335
And then eventually it was like,
oh we might as well just


78
0:3:26,335 --> 0:3:28,8
do the whole row.


79
0:3:28,8 --> 0:3:31,23
If you were actually here to see
how much we talk and argue


80
0:3:31,23 --> 0:3:34,66
about where sheets going to
go, it's just stupid.


81
0:3:34,66 --> 0:3:38,13
And then it will last like that
for a week until someone


82
0:3:38,13 --> 0:3:40,8
does another sheet, and then
everybody sits on the couch,


83
0:3:40,8 --> 0:3:43,98
stares at the wall and says,
All right what's going in


84
0:3:43,98 --> 0:3:46,68
next, or where is this one
going, or whatever.


85
0:3:46,68 --> 0:3:48,43
ELI QUINTERS: I don't know of
any other shops in New York


86
0:3:48,43 --> 0:3:50,13
that do all their own stuff.


87
0:3:50,13 --> 0:3:53,38
Aaron Coleman I know in Arizona,
that shop's all their


88
0:3:53,38 --> 0:3:54,71
own hand-painted stuff.


89
0:3:54,71 --> 0:3:58,95
And I think Black Heart has
recently done a bunch of flash


90
0:3:58,95 --> 0:4:0,17
for their shop as well.


91
0:4:0,17 --> 0:4:4,48
But I mean it's a pretty
rare thing really.


92
0:4:4,48 --> 0:4:6,58
And it's kind of funny when you
think about it, you know


93
0:4:6,58 --> 0:4:9,14
it's been so advantageous
for us to have it.


94
0:4:9,14 --> 0:4:13,82
And it's been so fun to do it,
it's really worked out.


95
0:4:13,82 --> 0:4:16,13
But not a lot of people do it.


96
0:4:16,13 --> 0:4:17,209
It's one of those things.


97
0:4:17,209 --> 0:4:21,149
Tattooing goes through those
stages, sort of coming out of


98
0:4:21,149 --> 0:4:23,24
real big custom lonely stage.


99
0:4:23,24 --> 0:4:25,73
Or it's getting back into people
who are realizing they


100
0:4:25,73 --> 0:4:30,11
can pick something off the
wall and if somebody does


101
0:4:30,11 --> 0:4:32,82
happen to have the same design
it doesn't necessarily mean


102
0:4:32,82 --> 0:4:33,7
anything bad.


103
0:4:33,7 --> 0:4:34,93
You now what I mean?


104
0:4:34,93 --> 0:4:37,14
Like certain designs
are just classic.


105
0:4:37,14 --> 0:4:38,73
STEVE BOLTZ: Oh I have to
have something custom.


106
0:4:38,73 --> 0:4:43,59
You know if it's on the wall
then it's very common and


107
0:4:43,59 --> 0:4:44,64
everybody has that.


108
0:4:44,64 --> 0:4:46,32
I want something
that's unique.


109
0:4:46,32 --> 0:4:49,43
But let's face it, the most
unique tattoos are always the


110
0:4:49,43 --> 0:4:51,15
ones that suck the most.


111
0:4:51,15 --> 0:4:53,72
The best tattoos are the ones
you've seen a million times.


112
0:4:53,72 --> 0:4:56,11
There's strength in that
crawling panther


113
0:4:56,11 --> 0:4:57,56
because you know it.


114
0:4:57,56 --> 0:5:0,87
Whether you have tattoos or
ever been in a tattoo shop


115
0:5:0,87 --> 0:5:2,36
that has power, I
think that it's


116
0:5:2,36 --> 0:5:4,68
recognizeability, it's iconic.


117
0:5:4,68 --> 0:5:6,34
I think it's up to the tattoo
artist to save the customer


118
0:5:6,34 --> 0:5:7,7
from themselves.


119
0:5:7,7 --> 0:5:10,3
In other words, like when I
first got into tattoos and I


120
0:5:10,3 --> 0:5:12,46
knew nothing about them,
I thought the


121
0:5:12,46 --> 0:5:15,12
ugliest shit was so cool.


122
0:5:15,12 --> 0:5:17,31
People come in and they
want something bad.


123
0:5:17,31 --> 0:5:19,98
It's kind of our job to say,
hey, you know what, like, we


124
0:5:19,98 --> 0:5:23,9
can give you something better,
or every other teenage girl


125
0:5:23,9 --> 0:5:24,47
comes in asking for that
tattoo, are you


126
0:5:24,47 --> 0:5:25,65
sure you want that.


127
0:5:25,65 --> 0:5:27,53
ELI QUINTERS: You have to sort
of educate or otherwise you


128
0:5:27,53 --> 0:5:29,1
just come off like a dick.


129
0:5:29,1 --> 0:5:31,53
You're just like, no, you got
to tell them why the design


130
0:5:31,53 --> 0:5:32,21
won't work.


131
0:5:32,21 --> 0:5:36,41
You've got to explain to
them what looks better.


132
0:5:36,41 --> 0:5:39,42
A lot of the customer's hold on
to it and they think about


133
0:5:39,42 --> 0:5:42,6
it, and they apply that
to their next tattoo.


134
0:5:42,6 --> 0:5:46,31
BERT KRAK: I think we want for
our customers to stay focused


135
0:5:46,31 --> 0:5:48,69
on what they see and hear.


136
0:5:48,69 --> 0:5:52,3
I don't really think there's one
design in here that any of


137
0:5:52,3 --> 0:5:56,2
us would be upset
with tattooing.


138
0:5:56,2 --> 0:5:59,18
Well actually there's one design
that we all hate in the


139
0:5:59,18 --> 0:6:0,43
shop, Dan loves it.


140
0:6:0,43 --> 0:6:3,57



141
0:6:3,57 --> 0:6:4,42
That band design.


142
0:6:4,42 --> 0:6:7,32
STEVE BOLTZ: It can be a little
confusing and a little


143
0:6:7,32 --> 0:6:9,99
bit overwhelming to a reggie to
come in there and see all


144
0:6:9,99 --> 0:6:11,9
that flash.


145
0:6:11,9 --> 0:6:13,87
And then a lot of it looking
very classic and then yes,


146
0:6:13,87 --> 0:6:16,64
there's like a sheet painted
on cardboard.


147
0:6:16,64 --> 0:6:19,17
There's sheets in there and
designs in there, that


148
0:6:19,17 --> 0:6:21,8
obviously we think are amazing,
that are very foxy,


149
0:6:21,8 --> 0:6:23,54
very simple, and clunky,
or whatever.


150
0:6:23,54 --> 0:6:26,8
And Dan's sheets are good
examples of that.


151
0:6:26,8 --> 0:6:29,13
He does some really
experimental--


152
0:6:29,13 --> 0:6:31,61
he manages to stay very
traditional and very by the


153
0:6:31,61 --> 0:6:34,73
book, but just completely off
the wall at the same time in


154
0:6:34,73 --> 0:6:37,17
imagery that you might not
necessarily see on every


155
0:6:37,17 --> 0:6:38,45
tattoo sheet.


156
0:6:38,45 --> 0:6:41,75
ELI QUINTERS: And he gets a
little more creative with it,


157
0:6:41,75 --> 0:6:45,43
their very unique, and very
clever, and very like well


158
0:6:45,43 --> 0:6:46,25
thought out.


159
0:6:46,25 --> 0:6:49,15
He's got one design,
the great mother.


160
0:6:49,15 --> 0:6:53,2
It's like a crystal with a
little person inside of it,


161
0:6:53,2 --> 0:6:54,33
and it's so weird,
I've never seen


162
0:6:54,33 --> 0:6:55,6
anything like it anywhere.


163
0:6:55,6 --> 0:6:58,51
But it's so smart, you know what
I mean, the way he used


164
0:6:58,51 --> 0:7:0,63
color in it, the way some of the
color doesn't go all the


165
0:7:0,63 --> 0:7:2,68
way up to the lines.


166
0:7:2,68 --> 0:7:5,5
Dan's much more studied in
the folk arts then I am.


167
0:7:5,5 --> 0:7:7,59
He really enjoys folk
art all across


168
0:7:7,59 --> 0:7:9,95
the board, most cultures.


169
0:7:9,95 --> 0:7:15,4
So I think he really knows how
to make tattoo flash look like


170
0:7:15,4 --> 0:7:18,1
that, look like very genuine
like folk art.


171
0:7:18,1 --> 0:7:21,22



172
0:7:21,22 --> 0:7:23,15
STEVE BOLTZ: We all buy
obviously a lot of books and a


173
0:7:23,15 --> 0:7:24,86
lot of tattoo related books.


174
0:7:24,86 --> 0:7:28,62
And Dan definitely brings in
books that we don't expect,


175
0:7:28,62 --> 0:7:30,81
that have great imagery in
them, that are not tattoo


176
0:7:30,81 --> 0:7:31,77
related all.


177
0:7:31,77 --> 0:7:33,54
And I think also it's
like he's sort of


178
0:7:33,54 --> 0:7:36,37
searching those sources.


179
0:7:36,37 --> 0:7:40,33
Obviously the recycled imagery
we love and is powerful.


180
0:7:40,33 --> 0:7:42,45
But we're also always
constantly


181
0:7:42,45 --> 0:7:44,65
looking for one new design.


182
0:7:44,65 --> 0:7:47,135
DAN SANTORO: I'd really like
to talk about this.


183
0:7:47,135 --> 0:7:52,2
This is a drawing from the
little Korean woman at the


184
0:7:52,2 --> 0:7:53,6
local bodega.


185
0:7:53,6 --> 0:7:58,77
She draws these things on the
sides of cigarette cartons.


186
0:7:58,77 --> 0:8:2,4
I just think they're super cool,
like this little old


187
0:8:2,4 --> 0:8:4,92
Korean woman that just peddles
cigarettes and like it's a


188
0:8:4,92 --> 0:8:7,58
little piece of outsider art in
Carroll Gardens that a lot


189
0:8:7,58 --> 0:8:9,56
of people don't even
pay attention to.


190
0:8:9,56 --> 0:8:11,65
I actually wouldn't mind turning
that in to a sheet of


191
0:8:11,65 --> 0:8:13,79
flash at some point.


192
0:8:13,79 --> 0:8:17,43
BERT KRAK: Dan's process is more
I think where he won't


193
0:8:17,43 --> 0:8:19,1
come to us with it.


194
0:8:19,1 --> 0:8:23,36
He'll start it or finish it
and then present it to us.


195
0:8:23,36 --> 0:8:27,24
I think it was last summer he
started doing these really


196
0:8:27,24 --> 0:8:32,99
loose super kind of folk art
style paintings, that were


197
0:8:32,99 --> 0:8:35,28
totally different for all of us,
none of us had ever really


198
0:8:35,28 --> 0:8:37,72
tried to do anything
like that before.


199
0:8:37,72 --> 0:8:42,3
And I think he really kind of
blew us all way with that.


200
0:8:42,3 --> 0:8:45,99
Just from him doing that it kind
of like helped all of us


201
0:8:45,99 --> 0:8:50,9
to do things a little
bit looser.


202
0:8:50,9 --> 0:8:52,16
The paper wasn't even really
watercolor paper, it was just


203
0:8:52,16 --> 0:8:56,22
some really weird junk that I
would have never even thought


204
0:8:56,22 --> 0:8:57,74
to paint on it.


205
0:8:57,74 --> 0:9:0,57
DAN SANTORO: I don't want to be
too cliche and say, like, I


206
0:9:0,57 --> 0:9:2,8
realize that I didn't really
have to follow rules.


207
0:9:2,8 --> 0:9:6,97
But yeah, once I painted on
cardboard I think everybody at


208
0:9:6,97 --> 0:9:11,57
the shop was kind of like why
are you wasting your time.


209
0:9:11,57 --> 0:9:14,19
Because this is something you
do when you're on the phone,


210
0:9:14,19 --> 0:9:16,93
but you don't spend eight hours
on a painting of it.


211
0:9:16,93 --> 0:9:18,86
So I did it and everybody was
like, wow that actually looks


212
0:9:18,86 --> 0:9:20,45
really cool.


213
0:9:20,45 --> 0:9:24,19
I'm also really influenced
by old game boards.


214
0:9:24,19 --> 0:9:28,8
Really naively painted game
boards that were something


215
0:9:28,8 --> 0:9:29,73
that people just would've
done at home.


216
0:9:29,73 --> 0:9:33,6



217
0:9:33,6 --> 0:9:34,92
This one is--


218
0:9:34,92 --> 0:9:38,71
I love the birds, than I was
just thinking about Sweetheart


219
0:9:38,71 --> 0:9:39,49
of the Rodeo.


220
0:9:39,49 --> 0:9:43,83
So it just kind of has like a
lot of the themes that I think


221
0:9:43,83 --> 0:9:46,26
go with real Americana
painting.


222
0:9:46,26 --> 0:9:49,65
It's funny because tattooing
kind of desensitizes you to


223
0:9:49,65 --> 0:9:52,56
anything other than painting
for the sake of painting.


224
0:9:52,56 --> 0:9:53,9
You know what I mean?


225
0:9:53,9 --> 0:9:55,71
So a lot of these things are
just all the things that give


226
0:9:55,71 --> 0:9:58,96
me a certain feeling.


227
0:9:58,96 --> 0:10:0,59
STEVE BOLTZ: How sick
are those things?


228
0:10:0,59 --> 0:10:2,2
Really off the wall.


229
0:10:2,2 --> 0:10:5,25
But so cool, right?


230
0:10:5,25 --> 0:10:8,19
He doesn't really like let them
hang around or show you,


231
0:10:8,19 --> 0:10:11,47
he does them and then
he takes them home.


232
0:10:11,47 --> 0:10:13,86
They're awesome, they're
so different.


233
0:10:13,86 --> 0:10:16,67
And I think that you could
probably see those somewhere


234
0:10:16,67 --> 0:10:19,12
out of context and not even
think about tattoos, or that a


235
0:10:19,12 --> 0:10:20,37
tattooer did them.


236
0:10:20,37 --> 0:12:20,37
