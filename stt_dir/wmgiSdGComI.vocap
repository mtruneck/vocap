###23 The morning of the 15th started off with relatively
###27 passive demonstrations in the center of Ramallah.
###29 And then at about 1:30 PM, some of those people and
###34 others who weren't there headed to the
###36 Israeli prison Ofer.
###37 [PEOPLE CHANTING IN PROTEST]
###42 Once the crowds reached Ofer--
###44 [SIRENS]
###44 --they were cut off by an Israeli, I suppose, blockade
###47 or checkpoint.
###48 And there was border guards, heavily armed with M16s that
###52 shot volleys of steel bullets coated with rubber, and a
###58 "skunk" truck, which is kind of a-- it looks like a water
###61 cannon truck, but actually it shoots out this kind of acrid,
###65 horrendous-smelling unknown liquid.
###68 [SMALL EXPLOSIONS, CHEERS]
###70 The Palestinians threw rocks continuously for maybe four or
###75 five hours.
###76 [SHOUTS AND GUNFIRE]
###80 The Israeli defense forces are fairly predictable in terms of
###83 their action towards these kind of demonstrations.
###87 There were volleys of tear gas roughly every
###90 15 minutes or so.
###91 [TEAR GAS EXPLOSIONS]
###97 Once the volley hits the ground in and around the
###100 Palestinian protesters, the teenagers go over and pick up
###103 these canisters, put them into these rock slings that they
###106 have, and swing them back at the Israelis.
###109 [MAN CHANTING]
###113 It's a lot of rubber bullets flying around, pinging off the
###116 metal around us.
###117 [MUFFLED VOICE OVER LOUDSPEAKER]
###119 [SUDDEN SHOUTS]
###120 [GUNSHOT]
###120 [VOICES CRYING IN UNISON, CLAPPING]
###123 [SECOND GUNSHOT]
###126 A guy just to my right was hit in the head with a rubber
###129 bullet, and it was not a pretty sight.
###131 There was a huge gash in his forehead.
###133 [SIRENS AND SHOUTING]
###149 The medics, I don't know how they do it.
###151 They swoop in a matter of seconds, pick these people up,
###154 and get them out of there.
