###12 CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: It`s Wednesday, I`m Carl Azuz. This is CNN STUDENT NEWS. Just
###16 a few minutes, we`re going to explain how musician can make money off of viral video.
###21 First of all, we are taking a look inside President Obama`s cabinet. These are the president`s
###25 top advisers who run different parts of the U.S government. Getting into the cabinet is
###30 a two step process. Step one, the president has to nominate you, step 2, the U.S. Senate
###36 has to confirm you. The Founding Fathers gave the Senate that power in the Constitution.
###39 It`s called advice and consent. Chuck Hagel has been on both sides of this process. He
###45 served two terms in the Senate, now he`s President Obama`s pick to be the new U.S. Secretary
###49 of Defense. Yesterday, he was approved by the Senate for that job. The vote was originally
###54 set for a couple of weeks ago, but there were some controversy around Hagel because of some
###59 of the things he`s said in the past. His confirmation vote was delayed by a filibuster. It`s a legislative
###64 tactic that`s used to block and delay action, and if you`ve studied up on this, it happens
###69 only in the Senate. The U.S. House of Representatives doesn`t have a filibuster.
###73 And this is how it works: the Senate allows for unlimited debate. In order to filibuster
###77 something, a bill, a vote, whatever -- once the Senator is given the floor, he or she
###82 just keeps it. You don`t even have to talk about the issue that`s being delayed. Originally
###87 senators had to actually talk when they wanted to filibuster. The record for that belongs
###92 to former South Carolina Senator Strom Thurmond. In 1957, he went for more than 24 hours. Now,
###99 you don`t need to speak continuously in order to filibuster. What you need if you want to
###105 end one, is 60 votes. It takes three fifths of the Senate. To end that debate and the
###111 filibuster. Yesterday, the vote to end the debate on Chuck Hagel`s confirmation was 71
###116 to 27. That`s stopped the filibuster, and opened the door for the vote on Hagel to be
###120 the new U.S. Secretary of Defense.

###125 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What`s the word: it`s an adjective that describes natural or raw
###130 oil before it goes to the refining process. Crude. That`s the word.
###134 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###141 AZUZ: When gas prices make you want to scream, try not to deafen the guy in the convenience
###149 store. It`s not usually his fault. Store mark up barely adds to the price of gas. If you
###154 really want to blame someone, you could blame OPEC. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting
###159 Countries, a group of 12 nations, has a significant influence on the cost of crude oil.
###165 For every dollar you spend on gas, crude takes the biggest chunk -- about 72 cents. The second
###171 largest factor in the price -- taxes. The U.S. federal government has a tax on every
###175 gallon bought. So do state and local governments whose taxes depend on where you live. They
###180 all add up to approximately 13 cents on every gas dollar. Unfortunately for drivers, we
###186 can`t just take oil from the ground, filter out the dirt and stick it into our gas tanks.
###189 We`ve got to pay for the cost of refining, the process of turning crude into actual gasoline.
###195 That covers about eight cents on our rapidly shrinking dollar. And then, actually getting
###199 gasoline to stations and maybe throwing in an advertisement here and there makes up seven
###204 cents on the buck. Now, all that adds up to a dollar, 100 percent of the cost of gas.
###210 So you can see how an actual filling station has practically no influence on the price.
###215 It does get a cent or two, but if you go inside and buy a drink and a donut, that helps keep
###220 their business fueled.
###223 Thanks to the Oscar nominated movie "Lincoln" there has been some talk lately about the
###226 13th Amendment, which abolished slavery.

###230 DANIEL DAY-LEWIS, ACTOR: Settles the fate for all coming time, not only of the millions
###236 now in bondage, but of unborn millions to come.
###241 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###242 AZUZ: The movie sent one man on a hunt for Mississippi`s role in the 13th Amendment.
###246 The amendment was ratified in 1865, but Mississippi didn`t officially sign on until this year.
###252 Except Mississippi lawmakers did ratify the 13th in 1995. The Mississippi`s Secretary
###258 of State`s office never sent the paperwork to Washington.
###261 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
###262 KEN SULLIVAN, UNIV. OF MISSISSIPPI MEDICAL CENTER: I don`t think there was any dark plot
###266 or any -- any kind of a plan to not get this done. I think it was just an error, and I`m
###270 just glad that it`s corrected.
###271 AZUZ: 18 years later, Mississippi`s vote is officially on the books.
###275 RANJAN BATRA, RESEARCHER, UNIV. OF MISSISSIPPI MEDICAL CENTER: What I`ve done or Ken has
###277 done is really just dotting an "i" or crossing a "t". But I think -- I think it`s an important
###283 "I` to dot and in important "t" to cross.
###285 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###286 AZUZ: Over in Europe, scientists are testing food samples. They are looking for traces
###289 of horse meat and products that were labeled as beef. Officials are conducting investigations
###294 about this, companies are pulling products off the shelves. Some consumers are buying
###298 and eating less meat. A lot of people have been affected by this scandal, but farmers
###303 may turn out to benefit.
###304 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###305 NIC ROBERTSON, CNN SR. INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: The family`s focus -- quality food close to
###310 the customer. Husband Mike helps butcher the beef when it comes back from the abattoir.
###314 MICHAEL BELCHER, FARMER: The supply chain is so small and we know everything about the
###318 animal, and there`s nothing that we don`t know about it.
###321 ROBERTSON: They`ve been farming here for four generations. Nothing frustrates them more
###326 than the horse meat scandal.
###328 They blame big food chains driving down costs to maximize profit. Supermarket greed that
###335 led them to take their own meat to market.
###338 BELCHER: I can survive on what Mr. Supermarket charges the consumer. I can`t survive on what
###344 he wants to pay me as the producers.
###346 ROBERTSON: And this is where the family meat ends up, on the table in the farmer`s market,
###351 100 mile south in London. One of several farmer`s markets they sell their product to, and over
###356 the past few weeks, they tell us that business is up.
###362 Customers like the direct access to the meat produced at Marshhouse (ph) farm.
###366 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I find the quality of the meat is very much better, and I know where
###371 it comes from. And I know that it has been raised humanely.
###376 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I would avoid processed, packaged stuff that`s, you know, all we see
###381 now at the moment. You don`t know what`s -- you don`t what`s in it. This here, you`ve talked
###386 to the farmers directly, they -- they prepare, they bring it in, and you can see exactly
###391 what it is and they can tell you exactly what it is. You can trust them.
###394 ROBERTSON: It seems that people don`t want the processed meat that`s in the supermarkets.
###398 For Mike and his family and the customers that come here, this can only mean peace of
###405 mind. Nic Robertson, CNN, London.
###407 (END VIDEOTAPE)
###407 AZUZ: All right, we`ve got another story for you about unexpected financial upside. It
###413 starts with the "Harlem Shake." Yes, the viral videos -- no we are not making one. Now, if
###417 you`ve seen you`re probably more focused on the dancing than the music. But someone did
###421 write the song, it`s his intellectual property, and every time someone clicks on the Harlem
###426 shake video, he`s getting paid.
###428 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###430 (MUSIC)
###431 AZUZ: The students at Colorado college broke every library code in the book with their
###437 version. "The Harlem Shake" even has this year`s Daytona 500 winner Jimmy Johnson dancing,
###443 and employees at San Antonio Sea World. Now, Baauer, the song`s creator, is poised to hit
###449 it big. He gets a piece of the ad revenue -- every time someone clicks on a Harlem Shake
###454 video.
###454 BILL WERDE, EDITORIAL DIRECTOR, BILLBOARD MAGAZINE: This could be a meaning for revenue
###455 stream -- if you figure a couple of dollars per 1,000 streams -- and you multiply that
###459 by millions -- you start to see that this is real money.
###461 AZUZ: Real money is right. As of last week 100,000 "Harlem Shake" videos have been viewed,
###468 some 400 million times on Youtube. And that`s boosting record sales. "The Harlem Shake"
###473 was the top song download on iTunes U.S. last week, and one of the top downloads on iTunes
###478 Europe. Baauer isn`t the only artist riding the viral video wave.
###483 (MUSIC)
###483 AZUZ: South Korean artist Psy hit pay dirt last year with Youtube phenomenon "Gangham
###489 Style" with more than a billion hits.
###491 WERDE: "Billboard" has reported that Psy made upwards of $2 million just from the streams
###497 of "Gangham Style", that was without selling a single track.
###499 AZUZ: But corporate America sees a financial opportunity in the viral video market. Pepsi
###504 is now promoting soda with its very own "Harlem Shake."
###507 (MUSIC)
###508 AZUZ: I asked about the "Harlem Shake" on Twitter yesterday. Most people were tweeting
###513 they love it. Tell us what you think. If you`re on Facebook, find us at Facebook.com/cnnstudentnews
###519 and say whether you love or hate the "Harlem Shake."
###522 (END VIDEOTAPE)

###524 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Is this legit? In nature, penguins are found only in the Southern Hemisphere
###529 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###539 AZUZ: The penguins` bodies are designed to move through the water. But getting them in
###545 the water -- that can be tricky. At least for this one. Walking down the board, he`s
###550 fine. Going off the board -- ah-ah. He takes another (pass coming up and chickens out again.
###557 This is some serious penguin trepidation. The bird is flightless, but he is frightful.
###562 One more chance, probably just going to turn around again, but this time, a little too
###567 close to the edge. It wasn`t exactly a swan dive, but sometimes when you need to get over
###572 your fear, you just got to wing it. Really, there was no pengoing (ph) off the board,
###577 he just had to get the courage to dive in with both feet, bird brain.
###580 We`ll pull our resources and meet you back here for more CNN STUDENT NEWS tomorrow. One
###583 more thing, teachers -- don`t forget to hit our homepage and show your feedback on today
###587 show. Thanks for watching. Have a great day.
