3
0:0:14,19 --> 0:0:16,72
CELERINO CASTILLO: My name
is Celerino Castillo III.


4
0:0:16,72 --> 0:0:19,79
I was born and raised
here in South Texas.


5
0:0:19,79 --> 0:0:22,7
I ended up in the law
enforcement field because my


6
0:0:22,7 --> 0:0:24,16
father used to be in
law enforcement.


7
0:0:24,16 --> 0:0:26,44
My sister, the same thing,
in law enforcement.


8
0:0:26,44 --> 0:0:31,41
And I decided to go to school,
get my degree, and become a


9
0:0:31,41 --> 0:0:33,47
law enforcement officer.


10
0:0:33,47 --> 0:0:36,84
It was in Vietnam that I
actually saw one of my friends


11
0:0:36,84 --> 0:0:39,61
died on an overdose of heroin.


12
0:0:39,61 --> 0:0:43,88
And right after a firefight,
we found him with a needle


13
0:0:43,88 --> 0:0:45,72
still stuck in his arm.


14
0:0:45,72 --> 0:0:50,24
And basically, what I did was I
picked up an AK-47 from the


15
0:0:50,24 --> 0:0:55,53
enemy and double tapped him on
the chest to show that he died


16
0:0:55,53 --> 0:0:57,67
in a blaze of glory, as
they say, instead of


17
0:0:57,67 --> 0:1:0,22
going home as a junkie.


18
0:1:0,22 --> 0:1:2,9
And I promised myself that if
I survived that war that I


19
0:1:2,9 --> 0:1:4,86
would become a federal
drug agent.


20
0:1:4,86 --> 0:1:9,75
I was accepted into
the DEA in 1979.


21
0:1:9,75 --> 0:1:12,99
Having a lot of knowledge of my
Vietnam experience, I was


22
0:1:12,99 --> 0:1:15,48
assigned to the jungles
of Peru.


23
0:1:15,48 --> 0:1:17,57
I ended up doing a lot of search
and destroy missions


24
0:1:17,57 --> 0:1:19,7
down there, working hand-in-hand
with the


25
0:1:19,7 --> 0:1:22,43
Colombians and the Peruvians.


26
0:1:22,43 --> 0:1:25,43
And we had what was called a big
major operation, Operation


27
0:1:25,43 --> 0:1:27,95
Condor, but there was a contract
put on my head, so I


28
0:1:27,95 --> 0:1:29,46
ended up having to leave.


29
0:1:29,46 --> 0:1:33,97
And instead of sending me back
to the States, they sent me to


30
0:1:33,97 --> 0:1:39,64
Salvador and Guatemala to train
the anti-narcoterrorist


31
0:1:39,64 --> 0:1:44,5
units, and do undercover work,
and run all different kinds of


32
0:1:44,5 --> 0:1:47,72
raids, and search-and-destroy
missions and so forth.


33
0:1:47,72 --> 0:1:51,59
Reagan, at one time, said that
we needed to stop communism in


34
0:1:51,59 --> 0:1:52,69
the backyard.


35
0:1:52,69 --> 0:1:55,73
RONALD REAGAN: In the Communist
world, we see


36
0:1:55,73 --> 0:2:0,4
failure because it does such
violence to the spirit.


37
0:2:0,4 --> 0:2:2,58
CELERINO CASTILLO: Of course,
that was not the fact because


38
0:2:2,58 --> 0:2:5,32
it was really not the Communists
we were fighting.


39
0:2:5,32 --> 0:2:9,165
We were just running covert
operations to help the CIA run


40
0:2:9,165 --> 0:2:11,25
their operations.


41
0:2:11,25 --> 0:2:14,19
And we ended up training--


42
0:2:14,19 --> 0:2:20,2
instead of drug interdiction
individuals, we were training


43
0:2:20,2 --> 0:2:24,33
the death squads, which went out
and slaughtered close to


44
0:2:24,33 --> 0:2:27,59
250,000 people in
Latin America.


45
0:2:27,59 --> 0:2:31,15
I was a cop, a detective, and
a DEA agent, which took me


46
0:2:31,15 --> 0:2:35,85
into Mexico working drug cases
and smuggling cases from


47
0:2:35,85 --> 0:2:38,67
Mexico into the United States.


48
0:2:38,67 --> 0:2:43,7
And at that time period, we had
a task force that combined


49
0:2:43,7 --> 0:2:46,85
DEA, county, and the
police department.


50
0:2:46,85 --> 0:2:48,86
I used to do a lot of
undercover work.


51
0:2:48,86 --> 0:2:51,26
And basically, what
I was doing, I


52
0:2:51,26 --> 0:2:52,24
played different parts.


53
0:2:52,24 --> 0:2:56,76
I played being a Mexican, a drug
trafficker buying large


54
0:2:56,76 --> 0:2:58,405
quantities of cocaine.


55
0:2:58,405 --> 0:3:2,1
We were infiltrating
drug cartels.


56
0:3:2,1 --> 0:3:6,65
With informants, we were
introduced to different


57
0:3:6,65 --> 0:3:7,82
members of the cartels.


58
0:3:7,82 --> 0:3:11,35
And at that time period, you
actually knew who they were.


59
0:3:11,35 --> 0:3:12,91
There weren't that
many of them.


60
0:3:12,91 --> 0:3:15,13
You got to remember one thing,
that in Mexico when you work


61
0:3:15,13 --> 0:3:17,95
with a federal official,
he actually


62
0:3:17,95 --> 0:3:19,885
has become your informant.


63
0:3:19,885 --> 0:3:22,43
And he gets paid with
federal funds.


64
0:3:22,43 --> 0:3:24,77
The majority of them
were corrupt.


65
0:3:24,77 --> 0:3:26,69
They pretty well ran
the whole thing.


66
0:3:26,69 --> 0:3:28,64
We were the law, as they say.


67
0:3:28,64 --> 0:3:33,2
Mexican authorities were known
to do the most outrageous


68
0:3:33,2 --> 0:3:34,57
thing you could think of.


69
0:3:34,57 --> 0:3:37,99
And basically what happened,
it was my first taste of


70
0:3:37,99 --> 0:3:40,33
torturing people.


71
0:3:40,33 --> 0:3:46,82
I remember when my senior agents
with the DEA would bust


72
0:3:46,82 --> 0:3:50,55
somebody down in Mexico, and
they would actually hang them


73
0:3:50,55 --> 0:3:57,105
upside down and use that
mineral water.


74
0:3:57,105 --> 0:4:0,7
And they shake it and
run it down his nose


75
0:4:0,7 --> 0:4:1,15
to clear his sinuses.


76
0:4:1,15 --> 0:4:7,66
And, of course, he had the same
effect of waterboarding.


77
0:4:7,66 --> 0:4:9,88
And they used a cattle
prod up here, too.


78
0:4:9,88 --> 0:4:13,67
You know, get you wet and use
the cattle prod on your


79
0:4:13,67 --> 0:4:16,31
private parts.


80
0:4:16,31 --> 0:4:17,56
It was just torture.


81
0:4:17,56 --> 0:4:20,1



82
0:4:20,1 --> 0:4:21,6
I couldn't understand.


83
0:4:21,6 --> 0:4:22,83
He said, well, no, this is
what we do in Mexico.


84
0:4:22,83 --> 0:4:25,26
And this is what we'll
continue to do.


85
0:4:25,26 --> 0:4:26,99
He says, we've done
it for many years.


86
0:4:26,99 --> 0:4:29,235
And you guys aren't going
to come in here and tell


87
0:4:29,235 --> 0:4:30,485
us not to do it.


88
0:4:30,485 --> 0:4:32,39



89
0:4:32,39 --> 0:4:34,5
It's the Rio Grande River.


90
0:4:34,5 --> 0:4:36,4
In the United States it's
known as the Rio Grande.


91
0:4:36,4 --> 0:4:39,9
In Mexico it's known as
the Rio Bravo River.


92
0:4:39,9 --> 0:4:44,87
It connects all the way
from El Paso down to


93
0:4:44,87 --> 0:4:46,84
Brownsville, Texas.


94
0:4:46,84 --> 0:4:50,41
It's used for all kinds of
illegal activity coming


95
0:4:50,41 --> 0:4:53,4
across to the US.


96
0:4:53,4 --> 0:4:56,76
You could actually see the
contraband coming across.


97
0:4:56,76 --> 0:5:1,77
Hundreds and hundreds empty
gallon containers of water


98
0:5:1,77 --> 0:5:7,8
that are used as floaters to
bring the people across, and


99
0:5:7,8 --> 0:5:12,65
clothes that has been dropped
there that's wet.


100
0:5:12,65 --> 0:5:15,8
And they change into clean
clothes, and they drop the old


101
0:5:15,8 --> 0:5:16,33
clothes there.


102
0:5:16,33 --> 0:5:22,4
And they continue on to the
shopping areas in Hidalgo and


103
0:5:22,4 --> 0:5:25,386
in McAllen, where the coyotes
will actually come and pick


104
0:5:25,386 --> 0:5:28,2
them up and take them
to safe houses.


105
0:5:28,2 --> 0:5:32,36
The safe house has also become
what as known as stash houses


106
0:5:32,36 --> 0:5:34,38
for the drug trade.


107
0:5:34,38 --> 0:5:38,78
And basically, they're killing
two birds with one stone by


108
0:5:38,78 --> 0:5:42,44
having a safe house for the
illegal immigrants and looks


109
0:5:42,44 --> 0:5:43,37
like nobody--


110
0:5:43,37 --> 0:5:44,56
you know, people live there.


111
0:5:44,56 --> 0:5:48,38
I mean, you would think because
of the stuff that's


112
0:5:48,38 --> 0:5:51,92
outside the house, but in
reality, they even have a


113
0:5:51,92 --> 0:5:55,2
little storage room, which is
probably for the drugs.


114
0:5:55,2 --> 0:5:58,43
Well, the coyotes are
individuals who actually do


115
0:5:58,43 --> 0:5:59,89
the smuggling.


116
0:5:59,89 --> 0:6:3,46
They're experts at what they
do because they do tracking


117
0:6:3,46 --> 0:6:4,46
and so forth.


118
0:6:4,46 --> 0:6:7,1
And they do surveillance,
countersurveillance, on the


119
0:6:7,1 --> 0:6:9,37
border patrol to find out
when they're in and


120
0:6:9,37 --> 0:6:10,876
when they're out.


121
0:6:10,876 --> 0:6:15,68
If we were to stop drug
trafficking today, our banking


122
0:6:15,68 --> 0:6:17,47
systems would collapse.


123
0:6:17,47 --> 0:6:20,57
Just about on every corner
you'll find a bank, brand-new


124
0:6:20,57 --> 0:6:23,25
banks that they're
shooting up.


125
0:6:23,25 --> 0:6:26,49
And, of course, the economy is
supposed to be down, and yet,


126
0:6:26,49 --> 0:6:27,71
here are the banks.


127
0:6:27,71 --> 0:6:33,2
What the cartels are doing is
using a lot of emails to go


128
0:6:33,2 --> 0:6:34,5
open a bank account.


129
0:6:34,5 --> 0:6:38,19
And then every month
they deposit


130
0:6:38,19 --> 0:6:40,74
$9,000 into those banks.


131
0:6:40,74 --> 0:6:45,2
And then they ask those people
to go back into the ATMs and


132
0:6:45,2 --> 0:6:46,4
take money out.


133
0:6:46,4 --> 0:6:49,43
So basically, that's how
they're doing it.


134
0:6:49,43 --> 0:6:53,13
75% of the drugs that come into
this country come through


135
0:6:53,13 --> 0:6:56,48
the point of entry, which
indicates that apparently


136
0:6:56,48 --> 0:7:0,4
somebody's being paid off at
the bridge of allowing all


137
0:7:0,4 --> 0:7:2,42
these drugs to come in.


138
0:7:2,42 --> 0:7:7,59
Drug cartels control
both the Mexican


139
0:7:7,59 --> 0:7:10,39
border and the US border.


140
0:7:10,39 --> 0:7:14,31
To them, to America, they are
more addicted to drug money


141
0:7:14,31 --> 0:7:15,8
than they are to drugs.


142
0:7:15,8 --> 0:7:18,24
I don't think that drug
trafficking will ever stop.


143
0:7:18,24 --> 0:7:20,6
It's too big of a monster now.


144
0:7:20,6 --> 0:7:23,73
They created a beast, and it's
going to be very difficult.


145
0:7:23,73 --> 0:7:26,56
It's like they've never been
able to stop the illegal


146
0:7:26,56 --> 0:7:27,15
immigration.


147
0:7:27,15 --> 0:7:29,4
They'll never stop
the drug war.


148
0:7:29,4 --> 0:7:32,23
The cartels have controlled this
side of the border and


149
0:7:32,23 --> 0:7:35,93
the US side, because they
have the money to do it.


150
0:7:35,93 --> 0:7:38,8
America is more addicted to drug
money than they are to


151
0:7:38,8 --> 0:7:44,46
drugs because of greed, money,
there is so much money.


152
0:7:44,46 --> 0:7:49,3
We have a generation of
individuals that are willing


153
0:7:49,3 --> 0:7:53,52
to take somebody's life
for $50, $100.


154
0:7:53,52 --> 0:9:53,52
