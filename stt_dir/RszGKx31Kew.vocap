###3 I'm telling you, you gonna like this.
###5 Let me change back to basketball games,
###8 I didn't come here to watch soccer.
###9 It's not about the soccer.
###11 Man, she better be hot.
###13 Listen, Mexican sideline reporters,
###16 and American sideline reporters are two different things.
###19 - Yeah, you know how you never see Hannah Storm
###20 from the waist down?
###21 - Yeah. - She's the opposite.
###23 No one knows what her face looks like.
###26 All: Oh!
###29 - <i>Gol!</i>
###31 - Man, look at that.
###32 She's so hot, I would hit Alyssa Milano in the head
###35 with Fran Drescher just to get to her.
###37 - Yo, you know what?
###38 Shorty make me want to brush up on my <i>habla español.</i>
###41 - She is so hot, elderly couples from long island
###44 spend the winter at her.
###46 - [Laughs]
###47 - I could not play football with her on the sidelines.
###49 I'd be dropping passes or running the wrong plays,
###52 showing up to the wrong game.
###53 - You did that stuff anyway.
###56 - Look, if anything ever happened to me and...
###59 Suzanne, hey.
###61 How you doing, baby?
###62 You're home early.
###63 - Hi. - All right.
###65 - Hey, guys.
###66 - Okay.
###67 - And that's our cue.
###68 - All right, it's been real.
###70 - Good to see you.
###71 - Next week? - Hopefully.
###77 Hey, babe, are you gonna be here next Sunday?
###79 - Uh, I don't know.
###81 Why? You want to go out?
###84 Oh, we could take the ferry over to bainbridwe
###87 and have some brunch.
###89 - Oh, no, I was thinking about having the guys over again.
###92 I mean, but if you're gonna be here,
###93 we'll just go to a bar.
###96 - How come I can't be here if the guys are over?
###99 - Well, I don't want to disturb you.
###101 - I never said you disturbed me.
###104 - That's 'cause you're not here while we're watching the game.
###106 I mean, if you were,
###108 then you'd probably be disturbed.
###110 - Oh, I get it.
###112 You don't want me here when you're watching the game
###114 with your little friends.
###116 - Why does this have to be about you?
###118 I'm just trying to watch the game.
###120 - I like basketball.
###121 How come I can't watch?
###123 - You can.
###124 Just not with us.
###128 Baby.
###129 Look, I love you.
###131 But every now and then,
###132 I just need some time with the boys, you know?
###134 Man time.
###136 - Well, I'm gonna be here,
###138 so you can just go to your funky little bar
###140 and have your man time.
###142 - Sweetheart, don't be like that.
###144 Look, what's for dinner, baby?
###147 - I don't know, baby.
###149 Why don't you ask your boys?

###171 - please pass the milk.
###174 - Are you sure you want me to do it?
###176 Maybe you want one of your boys to pass the milk.
###181 - I hope you're not like this when my mother gets here.
###183 - Oh, see, I was thinking maybe you didn't want me around
###185 when she's here.
###186 I've already interfered with your man time.
###188 I don't want to interfere with your mama time.
###191 - Is grandma coming?
###192 - Couple of weeks.
###193 And please, don't call her grandma.
###195 You know she hates that.
###196 - Why is she staying here?
###197 - I asked the same thing.
###198 - She's moving into a new apartment,
###200 and it's not ready yet.
###201 - Kevin, she's gonna be sleeping in your room,
###203 so make sure it's clean.
###204 - I made my bed.
###206 - We mean, if there's anything in there
###208 you don't want her to see,
###209 get it out of there now.
###215 - Whose bathroom is she gonna use?
###216 - Ours.
###226 - So he told you to your face
###227 he didn't want you to see the game with him?
###229 - Yes.
###230 Can you believe that?
###232 - That's great.
###233 Suzanne, that name loves you.
###234 Shoot, I'm jealous.
###236 - Uh, hello!
###237 Are you paying attention?
###239 He told me he doesn't want me around.
###241 - He's telling you how heels.
###243 I mean, I wish I had a man that honest.
###246 No games.
###247 No trying to figure out if he really has money,
###249 or is he just saying that so you won't get mad?
###251 - So you think Nick's right?
###254 - What do you think?
###255 Do you think he's right?
###256 - No, which is why I was thinking
###258 that next Sunday, you and I could go to no hitter,
###261 get the table right next to his,
###263 and prove to him that we fit in.
###266 - A little stalker-y, don't you think?
###269 - You cannot stalk your own husband.
###271 - Mm.
###272 You could be the first.
###278 - Ooh.
###279 Lord, I haven't slept in a little boy's bed
###281 since you peed in mine when you were five.
###283 Remember?
###285 - So what happened at your old building?
###287 - Oh, they're tearing it down.
###289 Apparently some guy cut corners when they were putting it up,
###291 so now the whole thing is falling apart.
###293 - Sounds like Lindsay Lohan.
###295 - Uh... - Hang on.
###297 - Well, you know, it works for me.
###299 I got temporary housing fees, and with that money,
###301 I was able to buy myself a new watch.
###304 Bam!
###305 - Ooh.
###306 Don't tell Suzanne about that.
###307 She might try to put you out.
###309 - Hmm, I wish she'd try.
###311 - Hey, Marilyn, can you...
###312 - I know. You want me to take you shopping.
###314 - I've been saving up to buy something.
###316 - Saving up? I'm impressed.
###318 What is it?
###319 - A pair of baby puff pants.
###322 - What is a baby puff?
###323 - It's P. Diddy's daughter.
###324 She has her own clothing line.
###326 - What's in the collection,
###327 leather onesies and platinum sippy cups?
###329 - How much do these things cost anyway?
###332 - $150.
###333 - $150?
###335 I'm not letting you spend that money
###336 on some baby pants.
###337 - Girl, I can make that outfit for $20.
###339 All I need is some fabric and my.
###342 - Really?
###343 You can make clothes?
###344 - Where do you think they come from?
###345 - Stores.
###347 - I told you not to put these kids in public school.
###356 - Hey, mom.
###360 - Kevin, what are you doing?
###363 - I'm building a tent,
###364 because one day, the world's gonna end,
###366 and we're gonna be roaming the streets like nomads.
###368 Only the strong will survive,
###370 and I'll be ready.
###372 Can you open this?
###373 - No.
###379 - Hey, baby.
###380 - Did you tell him he could do that?
###383 - Yeah.
###384 He wanted to sleep under a bush outside.
###385 - Well, I would have appreciated it
###387 if you had talked to me about it.
###390 Or maybe this is another one of those conversations
###392 you can only have with your boys.
###396 - All right.
###398 Game, set.
###399 Uh.
###400 Match.
###402 But you are being unreasonable.
###405 - I'm not being unreasonable.
###407 - Okay, you're not.
###409 - Don't patronize me.
###410 - I'm not patronizing you.
###412 I'm agreeing with you.
###414 - But if you don't believe in what you're agreeing to,
###416 then you're patronizing me,
###418 and I don't want you to give up your principles
###420 just to please me
###421 or start lying to me and doing things behind my back
###424 because you think I can't handle the truth.
###426 Nick, I married you for who you are.
###427 - What are you talking about?
###429 I mean, are we arguing?
###430 Are we agreeing? What?
###432 - You want me to take you back through it?
###434 - No, no, look.
###435 Do you want to come watch the game with us on Sunday?
###438 - Are you asking me?
###440 - I thought that's what I just did.
###442 - No, you asked me if I wanted to come.
###444 You didn't say you wanted me to come.
###446 - Okay.
###448 Suzanne, I would like for you to come watch the game
###452 with me and the boys on Sunday.
###455 Would you like to go with me?
###457 - Why you got to say it like I'm two?
###459 Okay, okay.
###461 I'm just playing.
###462 Yes, thank you.
###464 I would love to come.
###467 [Chuckles]
###471 - Man, she got all up in your head.
###480 -Day six.
###483 - It's getting rough out here.
###485 I miss my family and...
###489 I'm almost out of honey o's.
###492 [Mechanical whirring]
###496 - Wow.
###498 You're good at that.
###499 Where'd you learn how to sew?
###500 - School.
###502 They used to actually teach you stuff.
###503 See, you used to get out of school,
###505 you had a diploma, could get a job,
###507 and lead a life.
###508 Now you get out of school,
###509 you're in debt, dumb, and back at home.
###511 - What's a diploma?
###513 - Oh, lord.
###515 Anyway, we didn't wear designers back then.
###518 And there was none of this shopping all year long.
###520 Oh, no, you got your new clothes at the end of August,
###522 and they had to last you the whole year.
###524 - But what if they went out of style?
###526 - Then you went right with them.
###527 [Both chuckle]
###529 - Excuse me, ma'am.
###531 Mind if you use your plug?
###534 - What you supposed to be?
###535 - The future.
###537 - Go ahead.
###540 See, that's the problem with imagination.
###542 - [Chuckles]
###545 [All cheering]
###548 - Oh. - Oh.
###549 - [Scoffs] Can I get you guys something else?
###551 - <i>Si, si,</i> a plate of nachos, <i>por favor.</i>
###555 - I'm not Spanish.
###556 - I know, but you got me speaking in tongues.
###558 - Man, I would love to get lost at sea with you.
###561 - In that scenario, we'd both end up dead.
###564 - Listen, I want to apologize for the behavior of my friends.
###566 It's their make-a-wish day.
###568 But if you'd like to get together
###569 and I could apologize more, you know, vigorously...
###572 - Whatever, Robin Thicke.
###573 Walking away.
###574 - Watching you walk.
###576 - Hey, hey, hey.
###577 All: Hey. - Look who I got with me.
###579 Hoo-hoo. - Hi.
###580 - Hey, guys.
###581 - What's up, guys?
###582 [Clears throat]
###583 - There you go, 'zanne.
###585 - Nick, you didn't mention you were bringing Suzanne.
###587 - Ah, you know, it's funny.
###589 Nick didn't want me to come,
###590 but I said, "I like your friends.
###593 I like basketball."
###595 I thought this would be fun.
###596 - Well, good for you.
###597 - Great story.
###599 Um, Nick, I have got to show you
###602 this autographed Jersey they have out front.
###604 - I saw it on the way in.
###605 - No, you didn't. This way, please.
###611 What the hell is wrong with you, man?
###612 - You heard her. I told her not to come.
###614 - Well, then what is she doing here?
###616 - I asked her to come.
###619 - Why would you do that?
###620 - Dude, I'm married.
###622 Now, where's this autographed Jersey?
###629 [All cheering]
###631 - Oh, yes, baby.
###632 - Whoo.
###633 - That's what I'm talking about.
###634 - Here you go, sweetie.
###635 - Uh, <i>gracias.</i>
###637 - Does your wife know you speak Spanish?
###640 - Uh, <i>no comprende?</i>
###642 - [Chuckles] "Sweetie," huh?
###644 [Laughs]
###646 Somebody's looking for a big tip.
###647 Ooh!
###648 - Oh!
###649 - Did you guys see that?
###651 All: No.
###652 - Oh.
###655 - Oh, damn.
###656 - Rondo is playing like a little girl.
###658 Why doesn't he just take it to the hole?
###660 - Because every time he does, they put him on his back.
###662 - Thank you.
###663 - I like the kid.
###664 - Me too.
###665 - Ten bucks says he scores next time up the floor.
###669 - Definitely.
###670 - I'm in. I want some of that action.
###671 - Okay, y'all must like losing your money.
###673 Honey, can I have $10?
###676 - [Chortles]
###680 - Yes! - Oh, man.
###683 - You're gonna give me a chance to win my money back, right?
###686 - All right, Danny DeVito, trying to man up.
###688 - [Chuckles]
###692 - Ten bucks says that's a ten.
###694 - No way. I'm taking that bet.
###697 - [Chuckles] Booyah.
###699 [Laughs]
###701 [Humming rhythmically]
###703 What? What?
###705 20 bucks that's a charge.
###707 - No, no way.
###708 - All right, that's my last $20.
###711 - Ha!
###712 - Oh, my God.
###713 - Come to mama.
###714 - That's it. I'm done. No more.
###715 - Me too.
###716 - What about you, Martin?
###717 You want to go again, double or nothing?
###719 - Uh, I think I'm gonna have to go with nothing.
###721 I am Toni Braxton broke.
###722 - [Groans]
###723 - Well, I guess we're done here.
###724 I'll see you guys next week.
###726 - Yeah, definitely.
###728 - All right, guys. - Yeah, see you later, Nick.
###732 - [Chuckling] That was fun.
###733 - Yeah.
###741 - Hey, guys. We're home.
###743 - Hey, everybody.
###744 Hey, Kevin.
###747 - So how was the game?
###750 - Oh, it was good.
###752 - Ooh.
###753 [Chuckles]
###755 - Mom, dad, look what me and Marilyn made.
###759 - Oh, my God, those are amazing.
###762 You made those, Marilyn?
###763 - That's right.
###764 Stick with me. You might learn something.
###766 - I can't believe it.
###767 They look just like the real baby puffs.
###769 But here's the best part.
###771 Bam!
###772 I got my own designer logo.
###774 - Go take those off.
###775 I need to finish the inside seams.
###777 - Okay.
###778 - Nice work, Marilyn.
###779 - You're lucky I'm staying here,
###781 or I'd be charging you a grip.
###785 - Today was a good day.
###786 Plus, I got some spa money.
###788 - I am tickled pink that you had a good time.
###792 - Oh, come on.
###794 Don't pout.
###796 Admit it.
###797 The guys had a blast, and you know it.
###799 - It may have looked that way to you,
###800 but what you just witnessed
###801 was a master performance of a show called
###803 "men holding back 'cause a woman was there."
###806 - [Chuckles] Okay.
###808 You are just mad because you wanted it to suck
###811 and it didn't.
###813 - You wouldn't say that if it was you.
###815 - Oh, no, see, that's where you're wrong,
###817 because women don't need to change their behavior
###819 just because there's a man in the room.
###821 Now, if you'll excuse me,
###823 I have some spa appointments to book.
###825 Oh.
###827 And I want my $65.
###832 - <i>Buenos dias,</i> ladies.
###834 - Hi.
###837 <i>- Gracias.</i> <i>- De nada.</i>
###840 For you?
###842 - Thank you.
###843 - You're very welcome. <i>Chbo.</i>
###847 - I love this spa.
###849 - Mm. - Ooh.
###851 That boy would make me get my weave wet.
###852 [Laughter]
###854 - And I know he broke,
###855 but he almost makes me want to slum it.
###858 [Chuckles]
###860 - Well, I'm glad I don't know what his name is,
###861 'cause I might accidentally say it in my sleep.
###864 [Laughter]
###865 - For the purpose of this conversation,
###867 let's just call him...
###868 Nick!
###869 - Nick, hi.
###872 - Hey.
###873 Who's ready to get pampered?
###880 - Avocado hot stone shiatsu massage.
###883 Whoo, that sounds messy.
###885 What are you guys gonna do?
###886 - Uh, I'm getting the Nicky massage.
###891 - I'm getting the first lady,
###892 and my cousin here is going for Oprah's big "o."
###894 - It's organic.
###896 - Mm, that sounds good.
###898 - Oh, Suzanne, look, cucumber water.
###901 - I have water.
###902 - No, no, not this water.
###904 What's wrong with your man? - What?
###906 - You know Jevonne's boyfriend just cheated on her.
###908 I mean, we're trying to cheer her up.
###909 We can't do that with your man here.
###911 - Well, I didn't know he was coming.
###912 - How can you not know he was coming?
###914 - He's my husband.
###915 How am I supposed to know what he's doing?
###918 Is that the cucumber water?
###919 - Girl, sit down.
###923 - So what do you say, spalding?
###925 You want to surf the web?
###926 No?
###929 Yeah, you're right.
###931 I guess I do need to conserve the battery.
###935 How about just one video?
###937 Let's go for a classic.
###940 Let's see.
###941 I used to listen to this song when I was a kid.
###943 It's called <i>the good life.</i>
###946 It's good, right?
###948 Shh.
###949 Try not to sing so loud.
###954 - Kevin.
###957 - Shh.
###958 - I know you're in there.
###960 - We don't want no trouble.
###962 Ain't got nothing here for you.
###963 And I'm telling you, you don't want to come check.
###965 - Whatever.
###966 When Marilyn wakes up from her nap,
###968 tell her I went to the mall.
###970 [Door clicks shut]
###971 - [Exhales sharply]
###972 It's about to get violent.
###976 - Ooh.
###977 Now, this would look good on your toes.
###981 - Mojo melon, huh?
###982 Uh, okay.
###984 Suzanne, you didn't tell me Nick knows so much about toes.
###988 - I didn't know.
###989 - I didn't think most black men cared about feet at all
###991 till we saw <i>boomerang.</i>
###993 That changed everything.
###995 - Oh, my God.
###996 <i>Boomerang.</i>
###997 [Laughs] Eddie Murphy.
###998 Oh, for years, I wouldn't date anybody
###1000 that didn't have a mustache.
###1001 All that chocolate.
###1003 - Can you believe Halle Berry
###1004 played the plain girl in that movie?
###1006 - I know, right?
###1007 And earth a kitt.
###1008 "I am not wearing any panties, Marcus."
###1012 [Laughing]
###1020 You put this on,
###1022 me and your toes are gonna need a moment to ourselves.
###1024 - [Laughs]
###1026 - Oh, here.
###1030 [Scoffs] Look at this.
###1031 Another reality show...
###1033 <i>Real housewives of hip-hop.</i>
###1035 - What?
###1036 Now, you know there only but three wives in all of rap.
###1038 Everybody else is just a baby mama.
###1041 That's what they should name the show,
###1042 <i>the real House of baby mamas.</i>
###1044 - [Laughs]
###1045 - See, I couldn't have all those cameras in my house.
###1048 - Oh, they might catch some of that toe activity.
###1050 - How are you doing, <i>señoritas?</i>
###1052 - Good. - Ooh, I'm great.
###1054 - Fine.
###1055 - Fantastic. I'll be back to check on you in a few.
###1058 - Those pants are tight.
###1059 - I know.
###1061 - Those pants make skinny jeans look like sweats.
###1063 - I know.
###1065 - And that shirt was so tight,
###1066 I bet he could only breathe through one lung at a time.
###1068 [Hyperventilating]
###1070 [Laughter]
###1071 Look, you do push-ups, dude.
###1072 We get it, all right?
###1073 The auditions for <i>twilight</i> are over.
###1075 - Right.
###1076 - Shamar Moore called.
###1077 He wants to challenge you to a eyebrow wax-off.
###1079 - Oh, that's funny.
###1080 - You can't get tighter than that.
###1082 It's impossible.
###1083 - It's ridiculous.
###1084 - Nick?
###1086 We're ready for your pedicure.
###1088 - [Grunts]
###1089 - Uh, you're getting a pedicure?
###1091 - Well, I was gonna get some of these lumps
###1093 on my head worked on,
###1095 but getting my feet cleaned up just seemed like the way to go.
###1098 [Laughs]
###1099 All right, ladies,
###1100 I will see you on the other side.
###1102 - All right.
###1103 - Next time, bring you.
###1105 Uh, uh, uh.
###1106 - Oh, let's make a plan.
###1108 You better work.
###1109 [Laughs] Look at him.
###1110 He looks so funny.
###1111 [Laughs]
###1112 Bye, Nick.
###1114 - Hey.
###1123 - Hey.
###1124 - Hey, sweetie. Look at you.
###1126 [Both chuckle]
###1127 - Marilyn, are you leaving?
###1128 - Yeah, they got my place.
###1130 And as sad as it makes me to have to leave here,
###1133 got to go.
###1134 Fresh white carpet awaits.
###1136 Hey, turn around here and let me take a good look
###1138 at your little fine self.
###1140 That is a nice jacket. Where'd you get it?
###1142 - It's a baby puff.
###1144 - For $100?
###1145 - Since I saved the money by making the pants,
###1147 I got the jacket instead.
###1149 - Lindsey, the only reason I made you those pants
###1152 was because I was trying to teach you
###1153 the value of a dollar.
###1155 And then you turn around and pay $100 for that?
###1158 Girl, you missed my point entirely.
###1160 - I'm sorry, Marilyn, but you kind of missed my point too.
###1164 - And what would that be?
###1166 - I wanted some baby puff.
###1169 - You know, you ain't too old to get choked.
###1173 I'm surprised more kids don't go missing.
###1183 - Hey, babe.
###1184 Where's Kevin?
###1186 - Uh, he smelled.
###1187 I made him take down his tent and get in the shower.
###1191 You look relaxed.
###1192 - My feet feel so good from that pedicure,
###1194 I can't stand up.
###1195 - [Laughs]
###1196 - All that soaking, massaging, moisturizing,
