1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:55,23



2
0:0:55,23 --> 0:0:57,77
DAVID CHOE: This is an awesome
ride, and she doesn't want to


3
0:0:57,77 --> 0:0:58,73
be on camera.


4
0:0:58,73 --> 0:1:0,12
Actually very monumental--


5
0:1:0,12 --> 0:1:2,54
our first Asian ride that we've
ever got in my entire


6
0:1:2,54 --> 0:1:4,39
life of hitchhiking.


7
0:1:4,39 --> 0:1:7,27
She's half Chinese
and half Spanish.


8
0:1:7,27 --> 0:1:10,98
She said her father would be
upset at her for picking up


9
0:1:10,98 --> 0:1:11,42
hitchhikers.


10
0:1:11,42 --> 0:1:12,39
But she picked us up
because she saw our


11
0:1:12,39 --> 0:1:15,15
faces and we were Asian.


12
0:1:15,15 --> 0:1:17,4
And she said Asians don't
hitchhike unless they really


13
0:1:17,4 --> 0:1:20,6
have to because they have
too much pride.


14
0:1:20,6 --> 0:1:22,555
Little did she know, she
picked up the two worst


15
0:1:22,555 --> 0:1:23,9
Koreans on the planet.


16
0:1:23,9 --> 0:1:29,4
So we got a ride from Lena,
my favorite gay, Asian


17
0:1:29,4 --> 0:1:31,6
grandmother.


18
0:1:31,6 --> 0:1:34,606
She's been a wonderful ride.


19
0:1:34,606 --> 0:1:37,36
She gave us close to
a 300 mile ride.


20
0:1:37,36 --> 0:1:39,62
We passed out of Texas.


21
0:1:39,62 --> 0:1:42,915
We're going to head
into Oklahoma.


22
0:1:42,915 --> 0:1:45,66
I learned in this 300 miles
how horrible my gaydar is.


23
0:1:45,66 --> 0:1:47,24
I had no idea.


24
0:1:47,24 --> 0:1:49,612
She came out of the
closet in 1974.


25
0:1:49,612 --> 0:1:52,42
Her father still hasn't
forgiven her.


26
0:1:52,42 --> 0:1:53,99
She got artificially
inseminated by


27
0:1:53,99 --> 0:1:55,61
a Portuguese man.


28
0:1:55,61 --> 0:1:57,6
She doesn't like the gays these
days because they're not


29
0:1:57,6 --> 0:1:58,732
really gay.


30
0:1:58,732 --> 0:2:0,57
All the people that say they're
gay now are actually


31
0:2:0,57 --> 0:2:1,45
just bisexuals.


32
0:2:1,45 --> 0:2:3,84
And they need to just
pick a side already.


33
0:2:3,84 --> 0:2:6,22
I mean, I should have known
because of the haircut, but


34
0:2:6,22 --> 0:2:7,75
she kept talking
about her song.


35
0:2:7,75 --> 0:2:10,494
I asked her about her husband
or boyfriend.


36
0:2:10,494 --> 0:2:12,42
And then she just looked in
the rear view like I was


37
0:2:12,42 --> 0:2:15,34
crazy, and she goes, I'm gay.


38
0:2:15,34 --> 0:2:18,16
And I was like, oh shit, all
right, well excuse me.


39
0:2:18,16 --> 0:2:19,913
Sweet lady, was going to
give us a ride all


40
0:2:19,913 --> 0:2:20,91
the way to New York.


41
0:2:20,91 --> 0:2:25,58
Instead we [INAUDIBLE] stop in
Yukon, Oklahoma City, home of


42
0:2:25,58 --> 0:2:27,654
Garth Brooks and Toby Keith.


43
0:2:27,654 --> 0:2:30,86



44
0:2:30,86 --> 0:2:32,28
So here we are with Mike.


45
0:2:32,28 --> 0:2:38,19
He's taking us towards Tulsa.


46
0:2:38,19 --> 0:2:39,946
DAVID CHOE: Yeah, fuck yeah.


47
0:2:39,946 --> 0:2:41,196
DAVID CHOE: Yeah.


48
0:2:41,196 --> 0:2:44,12



49
0:2:44,12 --> 0:2:45,37
DAVID CHOE: Nah, man we're just
on a great adventure.


50
0:2:45,37 --> 0:2:48,7



51
0:2:48,7 --> 0:2:49,99
Mike's been fishing all day.


52
0:2:49,99 --> 0:2:51,6
Did you catch anything?


53
0:2:51,6 --> 0:2:54,841
Mike didn't catch
anything, but--


54
0:2:54,841 --> 0:2:56,7
MIKE: I didn't do anything.


55
0:2:56,7 --> 0:2:59,37
DAVID CHOE: Mike's a little
tipsy because he's been


56
0:2:59,37 --> 0:2:59,95
drinking all day.


57
0:2:59,95 --> 0:3:4,38
And he was nice enough to offer
us some wheat beer.


58
0:3:4,38 --> 0:3:7,78
And you promise not
to kill us.


59
0:3:7,78 --> 0:3:11,39
DAVID CHOE: OK, all right,
I feel better now.


60
0:3:11,39 --> 0:3:12,84
DAVID CHOE: How many beers
have you had today?


61
0:3:12,84 --> 0:3:15,485



62
0:3:15,485 --> 0:3:19,67
DAVID CHOE: [LAUGH]


63
0:3:19,67 --> 0:3:20,59
Thumbs up.


64
0:3:20,59 --> 0:3:23,28
Everyone in the Bible Belt
likes to DUI, likes


65
0:3:23,28 --> 0:3:25,38
to drink and drive.


66
0:3:25,38 --> 0:3:28,21
You ever picked up two
Chinamen before?


67
0:3:28,21 --> 0:3:29,46
Two orientals?


68
0:3:29,46 --> 0:3:33,29



69
0:3:33,29 --> 0:3:35,85
DAVID CHOE: You're
a Vietnam vet?


70
0:3:35,85 --> 0:3:37,14
DAVID CHOE: Mike is
a Vietnam vet.


71
0:3:37,14 --> 0:3:40,1
And that's why he has picked
up two Chinamen before he's


72
0:3:40,1 --> 0:3:41,93
ever picked us up before.


73
0:3:41,93 --> 0:3:45,475
What do you think about
the war now?


74
0:3:45,475 --> 0:3:46,437
DAVID CHOE: All right.


75
0:3:46,437 --> 0:3:48,361
You like George Bush?


76
0:3:48,361 --> 0:3:51,34



77
0:3:51,34 --> 0:3:52,86
DAVID CHOE: Tell me about your
love for George Bush.


78
0:3:52,86 --> 0:3:56,45



79
0:3:56,45 --> 0:3:58,1
DAVID CHOE: Well, I mean, you
almost looked like you had a


80
0:3:58,1 --> 0:4:0,77
tear coming down in your eye
when you talk about him.


81
0:4:0,77 --> 0:4:2,1
DAVID CHOE: Tell me
how much him.


82
0:4:2,1 --> 0:4:3,37
Tell me how much you
love that man.


83
0:4:3,37 --> 0:4:3,96
MIKE: Love him.


84
0:4:3,96 --> 0:4:4,855
DAVID CHOE: Love him.


85
0:4:4,855 --> 0:4:5,32
MIKE: Love him.


86
0:4:5,32 --> 0:4:7,42
DAVID CHOE: And his daddy.


87
0:4:7,42 --> 0:4:10,305
DAVID CHOE: And his daddy.


88
0:4:10,305 --> 0:4:13,45
DAVID CHOE: And Ronald Reagan.


89
0:4:13,45 --> 0:4:14,776
DAVID CHOE: Fucking rule, man.


90
0:4:14,776 --> 0:4:21,54



91
0:4:21,54 --> 0:4:23,67
DAVID CHOE: I don't get
involved in politics.


92
0:4:23,67 --> 0:4:25,444
I'm a lover, not a fighter.


93
0:4:25,444 --> 0:4:26,51
MIKE: Oh, motherfucker
you've got to


94
0:4:26,51 --> 0:4:27,46
get involved in politics.


95
0:4:27,46 --> 0:4:28,36
DAVID CHOE: I'm--


96
0:4:28,36 --> 0:4:30,29
MIKE: Kiss my ass, man.


97
0:4:30,29 --> 0:4:36,32
DAVID CHOE: Hey Mike, we rolled
through Amarillo, we


98
0:4:36,32 --> 0:4:38,37
were warned by the whites and
the Mexicans that the blacks


99
0:4:38,37 --> 0:4:41,28
are the worst people.


100
0:4:41,28 --> 0:4:42,24
DAVID CHOE: Yeah.


101
0:4:42,24 --> 0:4:44,16
That's true?


102
0:4:44,16 --> 0:4:45,97
MIKE: Well, yeah, I guess.


103
0:4:45,97 --> 0:4:47,67
DAVID CHOE: What's wrong with
the blacks out in Oklahoma?


104
0:4:47,67 --> 0:4:50,64



105
0:4:50,64 --> 0:4:54,6
DAVID CHOE: What do they do?


106
0:4:54,6 --> 0:4:56,58
DAVID CHOE: They'll
kill your ass.


107
0:4:56,58 --> 0:4:58,56
You wouldn't have picked
us up if we were black.


108
0:4:58,56 --> 0:5:9,45



109
0:5:9,45 --> 0:5:10,7
DAVID CHOE: Wow.


110
0:5:10,7 --> 0:5:13,42



111
0:5:13,42 --> 0:5:15,78
One of the best drunk-driving
DUI hell rides


112
0:5:15,78 --> 0:5:19,63
I've had in a while.


113
0:5:19,63 --> 0:5:22,258
DAVID CHOE: No, we're going to
hang out here, get some grub.


114
0:5:22,258 --> 0:5:25,18
At the--


115
0:5:25,18 --> 0:5:27,5
DAVID CHOE: What, you
can't [INAUDIBLE]


116
0:5:27,5 --> 0:5:28,316
MIKE: That's bad, man.


117
0:5:28,316 --> 0:5:29,185
DAVID CHOE: Why, what's bad?


118
0:5:29,185 --> 0:5:31,35
MIKE: I scared you all.


119
0:5:31,35 --> 0:5:33,16
MIKE: [INAUDIBLE]


120
0:5:33,16 --> 0:5:34,41
fucking turds, man.


121
0:5:34,41 --> 0:5:36,77



122
0:5:36,77 --> 0:5:38,8
DAVID CHOE: We're off into
the sunset, wish us luck.


123
0:5:38,8 --> 0:5:40,194
Wish us luck.


124
0:5:40,194 --> 0:5:42,122
MIKE: Well, I can't do that.


125
0:5:42,122 --> 0:5:43,372
Hey.


126
0:5:43,372 --> 0:5:45,2



127
0:5:45,2 --> 0:5:46,66
DAVID CHOE: You're a sweet
guy too, buddy.


128
0:5:46,66 --> 0:5:50,108
To be completely honest, you
did scare us a little bit.


129
0:5:50,108 --> 0:5:51,74
MIKE: I did?


130
0:5:51,74 --> 0:5:52,34
Why?


131
0:5:52,34 --> 0:5:54,62
DAVID CHOE: Well, it was
probably, like, the sixth time


132
0:5:54,62 --> 0:5:55,78
the car almost flipped over.


133
0:5:55,78 --> 0:5:57,42
[LAUGH]


134
0:5:57,42 --> 0:5:58,292
MIKE: [INAUDIBLE]


135
0:5:58,292 --> 0:6:0,89



136
0:6:0,89 --> 0:6:4,32
DAVID CHOE: Mike, you're
a great guy, and I


137
0:6:4,32 --> 0:6:6,29
appreciate the ride.


138
0:6:6,29 --> 0:6:8,83
DAVID CHOE: We're not
scared of you.


139
0:6:8,83 --> 0:6:10,67
DAVID CHOE: Mike, we're
completely all good.


140
0:6:10,67 --> 0:6:12,5
Mike, come on.


141
0:6:12,5 --> 0:6:13,62
So long, Mike.


142
0:6:13,62 --> 0:6:14,87
DAVID CHOE: I love you too.


143
0:6:14,87 --> 0:6:20,28



144
0:6:20,28 --> 0:6:23,71
DAVID CHOE: So Mike, one of the
best hell rides I've had


145
0:6:23,71 --> 0:6:27,34
in my entire life, a scholar
and a gentleman to be sure,


146
0:6:27,34 --> 0:6:31,4
basically gave us the grand tour
of Oklahoma blasting his


147
0:6:31,4 --> 0:6:32,545
favorite band, Hinder.


148
0:6:32,545 --> 0:6:34,78
His stereo was on repeat,
so we heard the same


149
0:6:34,78 --> 0:6:36,735
song about 17 times.


150
0:6:36,735 --> 0:6:39,82
He liked to scream at young,
black teenagers when we were


151
0:6:39,82 --> 0:6:41,39
pulled up at red lights.


152
0:6:41,39 --> 0:6:43,39
And blast Hinder, fuck
yeah, what do you


153
0:6:43,39 --> 0:6:45,22
think about my music?


154
0:6:45,22 --> 0:6:47,57
And in the last hour, drove
around, pretty much in the


155
0:6:47,57 --> 0:6:51,39
same one-mile radius of
where he picked us up.


156
0:6:51,39 --> 0:6:53,62
So actually we backtracked.


157
0:6:53,62 --> 0:6:58,102
So we're nowhere near Tulsa.


158
0:6:58,102 --> 0:7:1,255
And now I'm drunk, also.


159
0:7:1,255 --> 0:7:3,622
So we'll see where we
end up tonight.


160
0:7:3,622 --> 0:7:12,59



161
0:7:12,59 --> 0:7:13,84
Thanks guys, how far
you guys going?


162
0:7:13,84 --> 0:7:18,63



163
0:7:18,63 --> 0:7:25,92
So it's day seven, this is
"Thumbs Up." It's exactly one


164
0:7:25,92 --> 0:7:28,84
week going on this trip.


165
0:7:28,84 --> 0:7:30,79
There's this thing that happens
when you walk a lot


166
0:7:30,79 --> 0:7:32,82
carrying a lot of stuff
and it's hot outside.


167
0:7:32,82 --> 0:7:36,3
Your butt cheeks, if you're a
little bit overweight, they


168
0:7:36,3 --> 0:7:36,97
rub together.


169
0:7:36,97 --> 0:7:38,85
Your asshole starts
to hurt a lot.


170
0:7:38,85 --> 0:7:41,8
I'm pretty tired,
pretty hungry.


171
0:7:41,8 --> 0:7:44,868
But being so tired, I end up
getting reinvigorated, full of


172
0:7:44,868 --> 0:7:48,179
life by the kindness of
strangers, like the drunk


173
0:7:48,179 --> 0:7:49,13
people like Mike.


174
0:7:49,13 --> 0:7:52,95
I guess it takes a bit of
alcohol to turn a lot humans


175
0:7:52,95 --> 0:7:55,42
into humans.


176
0:7:55,42 --> 0:7:59,619
I guess being drunk turns you
from being this robot into a


177
0:7:59,619 --> 0:8:2,83
compassionate being that's like,
hey, there's two fucking


178
0:8:2,83 --> 0:8:4,806
humans on the side
of the road.


179
0:8:4,806 --> 0:8:5,32
It's hot outside.


180
0:8:5,32 --> 0:8:7,25
They look like they
are going to die.


181
0:8:7,25 --> 0:8:9,25
I'm going to pick them up.


182
0:8:9,25 --> 0:8:13,871
[COUGH]


183
0:8:13,871 --> 0:8:33,751



184
0:8:33,751 --> 0:8:37,672
G-BERRY: So what kind of
haircut we giving your


185
0:8:37,672 --> 0:8:38,922
partner, man?


186
0:8:38,922 --> 0:8:43,75



187
0:8:43,75 --> 0:8:47,775
DAVID CHOE: So what's going
on with Oklahoma?


188
0:8:47,775 --> 0:8:49,683
G-BERRY: Man, Oklahoma
is the place to be.


189
0:8:49,683 --> 0:8:53,145
We went to three states where
the second we rolled into


190
0:8:53,145 --> 0:8:59,62
town, like,


191
0:8:59,62 --> 0:9:0,39
G-BERRY: Is that right?


192
0:9:0,39 --> 0:9:1,7
DAVID CHOE: Yeah.


193
0:9:1,7 --> 0:9:4,496
G-BERRY: I mean, is that how
feel like blacks are here in


194
0:9:4,496 --> 0:9:5,444
Oklahoma, man?


195
0:9:5,444 --> 0:9:6,33
DAVID CHOE: That's
what they said.


196
0:9:6,33 --> 0:9:8,816
G-BERRY: I'm a black man, and
I'm proud to be black.


197
0:9:8,816 --> 0:9:9,38
You know what I'm saying?


198
0:9:9,38 --> 0:9:10,23
DAVID CHOE: I can see that.


199
0:9:10,23 --> 0:9:13,662
G-BERRY: So if a person tell
you to watch out for the


200
0:9:13,662 --> 0:9:15,211
blacks, whoever that person was
that told you to watch out


201
0:9:15,211 --> 0:9:16,628
for the blacks, you really
need to watch


202
0:9:16,628 --> 0:9:18,62
out for that person.


203
0:9:18,62 --> 0:9:20,46
DAVID CHOE: Hey, I got another
question for you guys.


204
0:9:20,46 --> 0:9:21,23
G-BERRY: Wassup, man?


205
0:9:21,23 --> 0:9:23,155
DAVID CHOE: How come black
people don't pick up


206
0:9:23,155 --> 0:9:24,405
hitchhikers?


207
0:9:24,405 --> 0:9:27,91



208
0:9:27,91 --> 0:9:28,21
DAVID CHOE: All right.


209
0:9:28,21 --> 0:9:31,59
Even if they look like
two nice Chinamen.


210
0:9:31,59 --> 0:9:32,84
G-BERRY: Man.


211
0:9:32,84 --> 0:9:39,11



212
0:9:39,11 --> 0:9:40,1
DAVID CHOE: I'm just saying.


213
0:9:40,1 --> 0:9:42,8
G-BERRY: Man, I'm
not stopping.


214
0:9:42,8 --> 0:9:43,8
For nobody.


215
0:9:43,8 --> 0:9:45,3
I don't care if it's another
black person.


216
0:9:45,3 --> 0:9:46,554
See you when you get
there, brother.


217
0:9:46,554 --> 0:9:58,25



218
0:9:58,25 --> 0:9:59,275
DAVID CHOE: It's all good.


219
0:9:59,275 --> 0:10:25,71



220
0:10:25,71 --> 0:10:26,951
G-BERRY: [LAUGH]


221
0:10:26,951 --> 0:10:28,201
I'm just saying.


222
0:10:28,201 --> 0:10:36,433



223
0:10:36,433 --> 0:10:41,363
DAVID CHOE: Because they put
you in a little closet, and


224
0:10:41,363 --> 0:10:42,86
you never see anybody.


225
0:10:42,86 --> 0:10:43,58
G-BERRY: Oh, man.


226
0:10:43,58 --> 0:10:45,27
DAVID CHOE: Yeah, it's like
solitary confinement.


227
0:10:45,27 --> 0:10:46,884
G-BERRY: How long?


228
0:10:46,884 --> 0:10:49,319
DAVID CHOE: It was three months,
which is nothing


229
0:10:49,319 --> 0:10:51,267
compared to 14 years.


230
0:10:51,267 --> 0:10:53,215
But they were trying to put
me in there for 7 years.


231
0:10:53,215 --> 0:10:57,844
And I don't know.


232
0:10:57,844 --> 0:11:0,249
DAVID CHOE: Like, Japanese
food, rice.


233
0:11:0,249 --> 0:11:4,97
[LAUGH]


234
0:11:4,97 --> 0:11:5,54
DAVID CHOE: Yeah, it
was tough, man.


235
0:11:5,54 --> 0:11:8,642
They didn't really
like me too much.


236
0:11:8,642 --> 0:11:11,65
DAVID CHOE: Come on--
of course I do.


237
0:11:11,65 --> 0:11:13,38
DAVID CHOE: [LAUGH]


238
0:11:13,38 --> 0:11:14,626
G-BERRY: He has officialy
been hood hawked.


239
0:11:14,626 --> 0:11:15,89
Hood hawk by G-Berry, man.


240
0:11:15,89 --> 0:11:17,45
HARRY KIM: The hood hawk.


241
0:11:17,45 --> 0:11:17,87
G-BERRY: Good to meet you.


242
0:11:17,87 --> 0:11:19,12
DAVID CHOE: Have a nice day.


243
0:11:19,12 --> 0:11:58,11



244
0:11:58,11 --> 0:12:0,93
DAVID CHOE: Still in Tulsa,
Oklahoma, having a tough time


245
0:12:0,93 --> 0:12:2,72
getting out.


246
0:12:2,72 --> 0:12:7,41
Amazingly, Danielle picked us
up on the side of the road.


247
0:12:7,41 --> 0:12:9,36
And her house is under
renovation.


248
0:12:9,36 --> 0:12:13,3
And so I asked her if I could
paint it, and she said yes.


249
0:12:13,3 --> 0:12:14,745
DANIELLE: It's got to be
nice, though, because I


250
0:12:14,745 --> 0:12:14,885
want to keep it.


251
0:12:14,885 --> 0:12:16,9
It can't be something that,
when you guys leave, I


252
0:12:16,9 --> 0:12:17,66
roll-paint over it.


253
0:12:17,66 --> 0:12:19,23
DAVID CHOE: Of course, I will
I'll make you beautiful.


254
0:12:19,23 --> 0:12:20,721
DANIELLE: Make it good.


255
0:12:20,721 --> 0:13:0,913



256
0:13:0,913 --> 0:13:3,88
my boyfriend would lose his
mind if he walked in here.


257
0:13:3,88 --> 0:13:5,86
DAVID CHOE: OK, let's just
do it really quick.


258
0:13:5,86 --> 0:13:8,485
Just to see how.


259
0:13:8,485 --> 0:13:10,86
What the fuck is
going on here?


260
0:13:10,86 --> 0:13:12,29
DANIELLE: [LAUGH]


261
0:13:12,29 --> 0:13:13,799
DAVID CHOE: What the fuck is
these two chinks doing here


262
0:13:13,799 --> 0:13:14,87
playing instruments while
you're dancing?


263
0:13:14,87 --> 0:13:16,16
Put your clothes back on.


264
0:13:16,16 --> 0:13:16,45
DANIELLE: Two chicks?


265
0:13:16,45 --> 0:13:17,2
DAVID CHOE: Chinks.


266
0:13:17,2 --> 0:13:19,84
[LAUGH]


267
0:13:19,84 --> 0:13:21,44
DANIELLE: I don't
talk like that.


268
0:13:21,44 --> 0:13:23,293
HARRY KIM: Oh shit, dude.


269
0:13:23,293 --> 0:13:24,62
DANIELLE: This is
my [INAUDIBLE]


270
0:13:24,62 --> 0:13:26,12
DAVID CHOE: Hi, how's
it going.


271
0:13:26,12 --> 0:13:29,41
I'm Dave and Harry.


272
0:13:29,41 --> 0:13:32,292
We're doing a portrait of your
fiancee on the wall here.


273
0:13:32,292 --> 0:13:33,542
DANIELLE: On the wall.


274
0:13:33,542 --> 0:13:42,984



275
0:13:42,984 --> 0:13:43,956
DAVID CHOE: Thank you.


276
0:13:43,956 --> 0:13:44,442
DANIELLE: Bye.


277
0:13:44,442 --> 0:13:44,928
DAVID CHOE: Bye.


278
0:13:44,928 --> 0:13:45,414
DANIELLE: You guys take
care of yourselves.


279
0:13:45,414 --> 0:13:46,386
HARRY KIM: Thank you
for everything.


280
0:13:46,386 --> 0:13:47,358
DANIELLE: All right.


281
0:13:47,358 --> 0:13:48,816
DAVID CHOE: Awesome.


282
0:13:48,816 --> 0:13:51,119
Awesome, awesome, awesome.


283
0:13:51,119 --> 0:13:58,95



284
0:13:58,95 --> 0:14:3,91
So as the sun sets in beautiful
Tulsa, Oklahoma, we


285
0:14:3,91 --> 0:14:7,58
have experienced many great
adventures in the barber shop,


286
0:14:7,58 --> 0:14:12,32
and also witht the Duchess of
Darkness, who's actually not


287
0:14:12,32 --> 0:14:13,81
dark at all, and a
sweet, beautiful


288
0:14:13,81 --> 0:14:16,798
butterfly on the inside.


289
0:14:16,798 --> 0:14:20,63
You know sometimes we get a raw
deal and we need to change


290
0:14:20,63 --> 0:14:22,8
our situation in life.


291
0:14:22,8 --> 0:14:26,73
So this seems as great a spot as
any right to hop a freight


292
0:14:26,73 --> 0:14:27,85
out of town.


293
0:14:27,85 --> 0:14:29,85
Still heading east.


294
0:14:29,85 --> 0:14:32,82
Many amazing cities to come--


295
0:14:32,82 --> 0:14:38,565
Memphis, Tennessee, New Orleans,
Miami, and a big


296
0:14:38,565 --> 0:14:40,5
hurricane on the way.


297
0:14:40,5 --> 0:14:54,89
So till next time,
"Thumbs Up."


298
0:14:54,89 --> 0:15:0,191
We rolled into Little Rock,
Arkansas last night.


299
0:15:0,191 --> 0:15:1,755
And tried to hitchhike out.


300
0:15:1,755 --> 0:15:5,5
And the state troopers
stopped us.


301
0:15:5,5 --> 0:15:9,16
It is just a little bit past
midnight, I believe.


302
0:15:9,16 --> 0:15:12,99
And we are in Arkansas.


303
0:15:12,99 --> 0:15:17,23
And we got pulled over by
these nice officers.


304
0:15:17,23 --> 0:15:21,46
They've amazingly not given
us any tickets.


305
0:15:21,46 --> 0:15:24,1
They're going to tell us a
little bit about Arkansas and


306
0:15:24,1 --> 0:15:25,6
hitchhikers and stuff
like that.


307
0:15:25,6 --> 0:15:27,7
O. CRAIG: We don't see a whole
lot of hitchhikers on the


308
0:15:27,7 --> 0:15:28,34
interstate course.


309
0:15:28,34 --> 0:15:30,88
It's illegal for anyone
to be hitchhiking on a


310
0:15:30,88 --> 0:15:32,6
controlled-access highway.


311
0:15:32,6 --> 0:15:34,328
We don't have a whole lot
of problem with that.


312
0:15:34,328 --> 0:15:35,192
DAVID CHOE: Have you guys ever
picked up hitchhikers?


313
0:15:35,192 --> 0:15:37,27
O. CRAIG: Oh, yes.


314
0:15:37,27 --> 0:15:40,83
We usually make sure they're
either aware that they're not


315
0:15:40,83 --> 0:15:42,87
supposed to be on the
interstate, and get them off


316
0:15:42,87 --> 0:15:43,77
the highway.


317
0:15:43,77 --> 0:15:46,66
And of course, if they're
non-compliant, then we wind up


318
0:15:46,66 --> 0:15:47,11
having to arrest them.


319
0:15:47,11 --> 0:15:48,2
Though we hate to do that.


320
0:15:48,2 --> 0:15:50,35
But sometimes you
have to do that.


321
0:15:50,35 --> 0:15:51,7
DAVID CHOE: Right.


322
0:15:51,7 --> 0:15:55,442
So thank you so much for not
punishing us for, you know--


323
0:15:55,442 --> 0:15:58,61
and anything else you
guys want to say?


324
0:15:58,61 --> 0:15:59,558
Thumbs Up, America.


325
0:15:59,558 --> 0:16:0,808
HARRY KIM: Thumbs up.


326
0:16:0,808 --> 0:16:17,614



327
0:16:17,614 --> 0:16:21,98
DAVID CHOE: We just jumped a
freight in Little Rock that


328
0:16:21,98 --> 0:16:24,659
has ceramics in it.


329
0:16:24,659 --> 0:17:0,88



330
0:17:0,88 --> 0:17:3,52
Memphis on the rails.


331
0:17:3,52 --> 0:17:8,125



332
0:17:8,125 --> 0:17:11,54
I don't who this guy is, but
I see his shit everywhere.


333
0:17:11,54 --> 0:17:14,3
I guess he's been hopping
for 40 years.


334
0:17:14,3 --> 0:17:15,4
I like his style.


335
0:17:15,4 --> 0:17:16,325
It's nice and smooth.


336
0:17:16,325 --> 0:17:18,237
Old school hobo.


337
0:17:18,237 --> 0:17:21,405
Hobo, short for hoe boys--


338
0:17:21,405 --> 0:17:25,19
dudes that used to
swing the hoe,


339
0:17:25,19 --> 0:17:29,67
riding the rails, vagabonds.


340
0:17:29,67 --> 0:17:32,64
Never came back, jack.


341
0:17:32,64 --> 0:17:37,61



342
0:17:37,61 --> 0:17:39,865
We're in a pretty dangerous
situation right now.


343
0:17:39,865 --> 0:17:42,685
We're in one the biggest yards
I've ever been in, and we


344
0:17:42,685 --> 0:17:43,41
can't find our way out.


345
0:17:43,41 --> 0:17:45,35
And there's like 300
tracks here.


346
0:17:45,35 --> 0:17:46,922
It's like a--


347
0:17:46,922 --> 0:17:48,86
what's that video
game? "Frogger"?


348
0:17:48,86 --> 0:17:49,69
HARRY KIM: [LAUGH]


349
0:17:49,69 --> 0:17:50,79
DAVID CHOE: It's like "Frogger."
We're, like, going


350
0:17:50,79 --> 0:17:53,97
in between the cars, and
they're like [BOOM]


351
0:17:53,97 --> 0:17:56,85



352
0:17:56,85 --> 0:17:58,29
All right, let's get
out of here.


353
0:17:58,29 --> 0:18:2,13



354
0:18:2,13 --> 0:18:3,68
Heavy fucking metal.


355
0:18:3,68 --> 0:18:8,33



356
0:18:8,33 --> 0:18:10,655
We just made it through
the "Frogger" maze.


357
0:18:10,655 --> 0:18:13,84
And the only thing is, we're
not really close to any


358
0:18:13,84 --> 0:18:15,49
civilization.


359
0:18:15,49 --> 0:18:16,74
So--


360
0:18:16,74 --> 0:18:20,825



361
0:18:20,825 --> 0:18:21,31
sorry.


362
0:18:21,31 --> 0:18:25,95
There's no train cops around,
so I feel pretty--oh shit.


363
0:18:25,95 --> 0:18:27,2
Let's get down.


364
0:18:27,2 --> 0:18:33,8



365
0:18:33,8 --> 0:18:36,384
We're a little bit outside
Memphis, I think.


366
0:18:36,384 --> 0:18:40,96
We we're going to try to hitch
it into town right now, but


367
0:18:40,96 --> 0:18:41,488
we're pretty tired.


368
0:18:41,488 --> 0:18:44,22
It was long, funky ride,
and really screechy.


369
0:18:44,22 --> 0:18:55,71



370
0:18:55,71 --> 0:18:59,73
We got picked up two
the weirdest


371
0:18:59,73 --> 0:19:1,26
Grateful Dead fans ever.


372
0:19:1,26 --> 0:19:4,23
MALE SPEAKER 1: GDF, baby.


373
0:19:4,23 --> 0:19:8,1
DAVID CHOE: Love Jerry Garcia,
but are into rap, graffiti,


374
0:19:8,1 --> 0:19:9,555
ex-vegetarians, and they'll
punch you in the face.


375
0:19:9,555 --> 0:20:14,95



376
0:20:14,95 --> 0:20:17,7
DAVID CHOE: We are in
Memphis, Tennessee.


377
0:20:17,7 --> 0:20:20,17
And a lot of things just
happened all at once.


378
0:20:20,17 --> 0:20:21,18
First of all, we're in barbecue


379
0:20:21,18 --> 0:20:23,98
territory in bush country.


380
0:20:23,98 --> 0:20:27,69
We were just walking down
Midtown Memphis and we ran


381
0:20:27,69 --> 0:20:31,3
into this amazing restaurant,
Casa Blanca Cafe.


382
0:20:31,3 --> 0:20:36,12
And then we aw the Jaguar and
were checking it out, and


383
0:20:36,12 --> 0:20:39,34
Aimer, the owner and the amazing
human being that owns


384
0:20:39,34 --> 0:20:45,16
the shop came out and told
us about the time he--


385
0:20:45,16 --> 0:20:46,11
this thing goes 180.


386
0:20:46,11 --> 0:20:48,62
He got ticketed for 155.


387
0:20:48,62 --> 0:20:50,49
Cops never caught him.


388
0:20:50,49 --> 0:20:52,6
Amazing human being all in all,
so we started talking.


389
0:20:52,6 --> 0:20:54,96
He's from Palestine, he's
from Jerusalem.


390
0:20:54,96 --> 0:20:56,18
While we we're talking,
he mentioned


391
0:20:56,18 --> 0:20:57,29
his ex-wife was Jewish.


392
0:20:57,29 --> 0:21:0,85
And that's like the same
thing as me marrying a


393
0:21:0,85 --> 0:21:2,89
Japanese girl or--


394
0:21:2,89 --> 0:21:5,56
AIMER: The story of me
and my ex-wife Karen.


395
0:21:5,56 --> 0:21:7,35
Is amazing.


396
0:21:7,35 --> 0:21:11,89
We got married when we
[INAUDIBLE] we start to go out


397
0:21:11,89 --> 0:21:13,28
almost every night.


398
0:21:13,28 --> 0:21:17,9
Before I mean, she [INAUDIBLE]
ask all kind of question.


399
0:21:17,9 --> 0:21:19,36
And after that, we
got in love.


400
0:21:19,36 --> 0:21:23,29
And her people before,
95% from the people,


401
0:21:23,29 --> 0:21:25,5
we know each other.


402
0:21:25,5 --> 0:21:27,86
And when they find that I am
Arab, they start to hate me


403
0:21:27,86 --> 0:21:30,33
and they start to take
her away from me.


404
0:21:30,33 --> 0:21:32,46
Telling all some bad
things about me.


405
0:21:32,46 --> 0:21:33,57
He's going to kill you--


406
0:21:33,57 --> 0:21:35,653
DAVID CHOE: Your relationship
just could


407
0:21:35,653 --> 0:21:37,6
start an entire war.


408
0:21:37,6 --> 0:21:41,975
I mean, that's like, the most
taboo sex, like Jew on Arab


409
0:21:41,975 --> 0:21:44,87
porn, it's insane.


410
0:21:44,87 --> 0:21:47,66
AIMER: I mean, even her brother,
and her mother, and


411
0:21:47,66 --> 0:21:49,85
her all her brothers, nobody
came to the wedding.


412
0:21:49,85 --> 0:21:51,17
DAVID CHOE: No one came
to the wedding?


413
0:21:51,17 --> 0:21:52,14
AIMER: No one.


414
0:21:52,14 --> 0:21:52,58
No one.


415
0:21:52,58 --> 0:21:54,53
And nobody's spoke to
her for three years.


416
0:21:54,53 --> 0:21:56,238
DAVID CHOE: Was the sex
good, at least?


417
0:21:56,238 --> 0:21:58,19
AIMER: It was awesome.


418
0:21:58,19 --> 0:21:59,17
[LAUGHTER]


419
0:21:59,17 --> 0:22:1,85
DAVID CHOE: And then actually,
a second question, which is


420
0:22:1,85 --> 0:22:3,55
even more important than
that question.


421
0:22:3,55 --> 0:22:5,835
And that question is,
can we get a ride?


422
0:22:5,835 --> 0:22:7,132
in the Jaguar.


423
0:22:7,132 --> 0:22:8,52
AIMER: Let's go.


424
0:22:8,52 --> 0:22:9,572
DAVID CHOE: No, you
give us a ride.


425
0:22:9,572 --> 0:22:10,822
You give us a ride.


426
0:22:10,822 --> 0:22:14,0



427
0:22:14,0 --> 0:22:15,606
Our best ride so far.


428
0:22:15,606 --> 0:22:16,856
Thumbs Up, America.


429
0:22:16,856 --> 0:22:25,41



430
0:22:25,41 --> 0:22:29,6
We are still in Memphis,
Tennessee.


431
0:22:29,6 --> 0:22:33,22
Unbelievable luck yesterday,
we ran into Aimer, a


432
0:22:33,22 --> 0:22:35,74
Palestinian man who let us
stay at his mansion.


433
0:22:35,74 --> 0:22:39,1
And cooked us the most amazing
lunch, and then dinner, and


434
0:22:39,1 --> 0:22:40,86
then breakfast this morning.


435
0:22:40,86 --> 0:22:43,29
Dropped us off in his Jaguar
at the wonderful


436
0:22:43,29 --> 0:22:45,41
Wonder Bread Factory.


437
0:22:45,41 --> 0:22:50,7
Wonder Bread, delicious,
amazing, wonder, white bread.


438
0:22:50,7 --> 0:22:55,25
And it's a good thing because
we are heading into the


439
0:22:55,25 --> 0:22:56,99
Mississippi.


440
0:22:56,99 --> 0:23:0,55
So far we've cut through states
that have a lot of


441
0:23:0,55 --> 0:23:3,69
hatred towards a black people
from the whites.


442
0:23:3,69 --> 0:23:6,28
And now we're going to sort of
flip-flop and head into the


443
0:23:6,28 --> 0:23:8,12
states where there's a lot of
hatred toward white people


444
0:23:8,12 --> 0:23:9,3
from the blacks.


445
0:23:9,3 --> 0:23:11,88
So what better way to start the
day with some white bread.


446
0:23:11,88 --> 0:23:15,3
Also Wonder Bread is
the most amazing


447
0:23:15,3 --> 0:23:18,14
ingredient for budget eating.


448
0:23:18,14 --> 0:23:21,45
So we're going try to score some
free Wonder Bread or buy


449
0:23:21,45 --> 0:23:24,62
some at the bread discount
store thrift store.


450
0:23:24,62 --> 0:23:26,6
And I will show you some tricks
of the trade and some


451
0:23:26,6 --> 0:23:29,675
of Dave Choe's favorite
Wonder Bread recipes.


452
0:23:29,675 --> 0:23:46,14



453
0:23:46,14 --> 0:23:48,97
This is my makeshift
cooking show.


454
0:23:48,97 --> 0:23:53,46



455
0:23:53,46 --> 0:23:55,64
I'm going to show you how to
eat really healthy and


456
0:23:55,64 --> 0:23:56,89
nutritious on the road.


457
0:23:56,89 --> 0:24:1,4
We've got Wonder Bread,
sardines, we have Tang.


458
0:24:1,4 --> 0:24:2,97
And we have peanut butter.


459
0:24:2,97 --> 0:24:12,602
When you eat this, and chew this
up in your mouth, that's


460
0:24:12,602 --> 0:24:14,62
what it looks like.


461
0:24:14,62 --> 0:24:15,68
Do you know what that is?


462
0:24:15,68 --> 0:24:17,4
That's glue in your stomach.


463
0:24:17,4 --> 0:24:21,825
And say this is your stomach,
and you have glue going down.


464
0:24:21,825 --> 0:24:25,31
It squeezes your stomach into
a pasty knot, and you're not


465
0:24:25,31 --> 0:24:26,39
hungry forever.


466
0:24:26,39 --> 0:24:27,495
It's a great diet plan.


467
0:24:27,495 --> 0:24:29,97
You don't get hungry.


468
0:24:29,97 --> 0:24:31,57
And it's really hard to force
down after a while.


469
0:24:31,57 --> 0:24:32,92
I mean, I can't even
talk right now.


470
0:24:32,92 --> 0:24:33,93
I've got peanut butter
and Wonder Bread


471
0:24:33,93 --> 0:24:35,49
all mixed right there.


472
0:24:35,49 --> 0:24:38,6
So this is more of
a survival thing.


473
0:24:38,6 --> 0:24:40,5
Now, they've got sardines
and all kinds of sauces.


474
0:24:40,5 --> 0:24:42,75
But the best one to bring on
the road is any kind of


475
0:24:42,75 --> 0:24:44,82
sardine with any kind of oil.


476
0:24:44,82 --> 0:24:48,2
This one has soybean oil
with hot green chilis.


477
0:24:48,2 --> 0:24:50,19
Olive oil's good, but we're
not doing gourmet today.


478
0:24:50,19 --> 0:24:52,9
So here, we've got a delicious
fish's head sandwich for you.


479
0:24:52,9 --> 0:24:53,24
HARRY KIM: Mmm.


480
0:24:53,24 --> 0:24:54,6
DAVID CHOE: Mmm.


481
0:24:54,6 --> 0:24:55,21
HARRY KIM: Send it over.


482
0:24:55,21 --> 0:24:59,7
DAVID CHOE: With green chilis.


483
0:24:59,7 --> 0:24:59,64
All right.


484
0:24:59,64 --> 0:25:1,765
Who doesn't like Tang.


485
0:25:1,765 --> 0:25:7,94
Tang is the astronaut drink made
for astronauts, used in


486
0:25:7,94 --> 0:25:12,16
space, delicious on a summer
day with water.


487
0:25:12,16 --> 0:25:13,96
You never think Tang
and Wonder Bread.


488
0:25:13,96 --> 0:25:17,85
But boy, you're in for a special
treat right now.


489
0:25:17,85 --> 0:25:19,99
When I've got for you today--


490
0:25:19,99 --> 0:25:21,23
Tang balls.


491
0:25:21,23 --> 0:25:22,63
And what are Tang balls?


492
0:25:22,63 --> 0:25:23,75
Exactly what it sounds like.


493
0:25:23,75 --> 0:25:28,34
A delicious, tangy, sweet,
delicious, after-dinner


494
0:25:28,34 --> 0:25:29,34
dessert treat.


495
0:25:29,34 --> 0:25:31,0
Gets the fish oil taste
out of your mouth.


496
0:25:31,0 --> 0:25:34,21
Gets the peanut butter taste
out of your mouth.


497
0:25:34,21 --> 0:25:35,3
Delicious.


498
0:25:35,3 --> 0:25:37,78
Never tasted anything like it.


499
0:25:37,78 --> 0:25:40,2
Bon appetit, America.


500
0:25:40,2 --> 0:25:52,302
Bon appetit,


501
0:25:52,302 --> 0:25:54,79
Here we are at the Mississippi
River.


502
0:25:54,79 --> 0:25:57,4
We've traveled the state
so far by car,


503
0:25:57,4 --> 0:26:0,19
automobiles, and trains.


504
0:26:0,19 --> 0:26:4,24
And we're really liking the
look of this river.


505
0:26:4,24 --> 0:26:6,7
This dirty, amazing,
fucking river.


506
0:26:6,7 --> 0:26:25,6



507
0:26:25,6 --> 0:26:27,8
Hello, Old Miss.


508
0:26:27,8 --> 0:26:32,31
M-I-S-S-I-S-S-I-P-P-I. I'm
pretty sure we just crossed


509
0:26:32,31 --> 0:26:33,89
over somewhere over
the state line.


510
0:26:33,89 --> 0:26:36,43
We couldn't get a ride so we
just walked and hiked, it's


511
0:26:36,43 --> 0:26:41,1
hot outside, from Memphis
into the state line for


512
0:26:41,1 --> 0:26:43,234
Mississippi.


513
0:26:43,234 --> 0:26:45,667
And we are on one of
the back roads.


514
0:26:45,667 --> 0:26:47,647
You can heard the harmonica
music in


515
0:26:47,647 --> 0:26:48,87
the background somewhere.


516
0:26:48,87 --> 0:26:53,89
We'll try to catch a boat
on the river, we'll see.


517
0:26:53,89 --> 0:26:55,14
Looks like the jungle.


518
0:26:55,14 --> 0:28:55,14
