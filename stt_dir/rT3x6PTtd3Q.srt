gallup has are released its of latest
report on obesity in america and they


2
0:0:4,89 --> 0:0:8,99
have found out which states are the most
obese and which states are the most


3
0:0:8,99 --> 0:0:12,59
healthy so why are we going to take a
look at the eleven states with the


4
0:0:12,59 --> 0:0:14,37
lowest obesity rates


5
0:0:14,37 --> 0:0:17,8
colorado comes in at number one on the
eighteen point seven percent of the


6
0:0:17,8 --> 0:0:21,67
residence in colorado are peace coming
in number two is massachusetts and


7
0:0:21,67 --> 0:0:26,24
montana connecticut california new tires
on a rhode island idaho new jersey


8
0:0:26,24 --> 0:0:31,0
and washington mom sound anne as you
know i'm not surprised that colorado's


9
0:0:31,0 --> 0:0:31,809
lotto


10
0:0:31,809 --> 0:0:33,45
hippies biking karun


11
0:0:33,45 --> 0:0:34,579

12
0:0:34,579 --> 0:0:37,939
those guys it i don't know why but i
feel like colorado their all super


13
0:0:37,939 --> 0:0:40,22
fidelity in the mountains


14
0:0:40,22 --> 0:0:41,2
the green in that


15
0:0:41,2 --> 0:0:45,4
and they don't work hard at work in the
lines are all on by x


16
0:0:45,4 --> 0:0:46,98
drawing malcolm's


17
0:0:46,98 --> 0:0:51,19
of a big believer yet colorado make
sense that present resembles a lot of


18
0:0:51,19 --> 0:0:53,17
translate means


19
0:0:53,17 --> 0:0:57,86
we favor top ten year rightly so um...
you know i i'd look at the margin of air


20
0:0:57,86 --> 0:1:1,32
with this gallup study and i think that
they're underestimating the margin of


21
0:1:1,32 --> 0:1:4,7
error and all discuss why in just a
little bit but al let's look at the ten


22
0:1:4,7 --> 0:1:7,27
states with the highest obesity agreed
sentiment


23
0:1:7,27 --> 0:1:11,66
coming in a number one is of west
virginia in fact in west virginia i has


24
0:1:11,66 --> 0:1:13,529
been the most of the state


25
0:1:13,529 --> 0:1:15,8
for the third year


26
0:1:15,8 --> 0:1:19,46
uh... coming in over to his mississippi
than arkansas louisiana alabama kentucky


27
0:1:19,46 --> 0:1:24,43
tennessee of high oklahoma and i wanna
unity secure anyway that was a pattern


28
0:1:24,43 --> 0:1:25,35
here


29
0:1:25,35 --> 0:1:29,35
okay nida self is a very well
represented


30
0:1:29,35 --> 0:1:31,54
and they're almost allred states


31
0:1:31,54 --> 0:1:36,18
bell-violin said that i wasn't but there
you know they're purple


32
0:1:36,18 --> 0:1:37,149
is so it's


33
0:1:37,149 --> 0:1:39,95
and i know i've been in west virginia
excitement


34
0:1:39,95 --> 0:1:42,71
we were at the end of the most part of
that


35
0:1:42,71 --> 0:1:46,45
they sell six on top of that that


36
0:1:46,45 --> 0:1:51,22
patients dogs dogs


37
0:1:51,22 --> 0:1:56,1
seventy and i was prepared for the pratt
state three years of war


38
0:1:56,1 --> 0:1:57,19
that's incredible


39
0:1:57,19 --> 0:2:2,2
um... while just to give you an idea of
you know what we're dealing with overall


40
0:2:2,2 --> 0:2:4,399
about twenty six point two percent


41
0:2:4,399 --> 0:2:6,74
of the united states is all these


42
0:2:6,74 --> 0:2:10,11
however i do have an issue with the way
that they did the study now i have the


43
0:2:10,11 --> 0:2:12,66
study was basically based on self
reporting


44
0:2:12,66 --> 0:2:16,29
they called about three hundred fifty
thousand americans in all fifty states


45
0:2:16,29 --> 0:2:20,25
uh... hands-off reporting already makes
me a little skeptical of the results


46
0:2:20,25 --> 0:2:25,409
that they also uh... ask for their front
and their weight so they can calculate


47
0:2:25,409 --> 0:2:26,889
b_m_i_


48
0:2:26,889 --> 0:2:30,659
the issue of the sea bass at v_m_i_'s we
always do you agree to solve this


49
0:2:30,659 --> 0:2:32,329
v_m_i_'s bs


50
0:2:32,329 --> 0:2:36,629
they dislike super strong gusting
kentucky west virginia right


51
0:2:36,629 --> 0:2:38,599
that fault lines


52
0:2:38,599 --> 0:2:42,929
nowpublic really the other thing that is
is is all of those things are poor


53
0:2:42,929 --> 0:2:46,879
and i wanted to leave therefore you are
the more likely you are to be obese is


54
0:2:46,879 --> 0:2:49,21
very ironic when you think about it


55
0:2:49,21 --> 0:2:55,6
but it makes sense this you're jumping
it was mostly courtroom who


56
0:2:55,6 --> 0:2:57,259
seagram's fast food is really cheap


57
0:2:57,259 --> 0:3:0,889
i go six happens in west virginia i
think they were ridiculous if you


58
0:3:0,889 --> 0:3:2,189
remember boost


59
0:3:2,189 --> 0:3:4,6
two dollars three dollars but couldn't
believe how


60
0:3:4,6 --> 0:3:7,169
well was it may be why it's it's not
that good


61
0:3:7,169 --> 0:3:11,59
you know i couldn't possibly permission
but before i i i believe those numbers i


62
0:3:11,59 --> 0:3:11,949
think that


63
0:3:11,949 --> 0:3:15,59
you know they might not be exactly right
but within the right context


64
0:3:15,59 --> 0:3:16,119
i think some of those


65
0:3:16,119 --> 0:3:19,899
statistics with a few more outdoor
activities in opening a groovy serotypes


66
0:3:19,899 --> 0:3:20,779
aside


67
0:3:20,779 --> 0:3:22,319
uh... they're more likely to be fair


68
0:3:22,319 --> 0:3:25,959
in the states where there's a lot of
poverty they likely to be more of these


69
0:3:25,959 --> 0:3:28,589
yep definitely in and uh... and of
course in


70
0:3:28,589 --> 0:3:30,599
you always know that it's about


71
0:3:30,599 --> 0:3:35,66
what you eat like healthy nutrition
means more attend the exercising too


72
0:3:35,66 --> 0:3:39,22
exercise is good to keep your muscles
healthy your bones health the


73
0:3:39,22 --> 0:3:39,959
abut


74
0:3:39,959 --> 0:3:42,76
at the end of the day the most important
thing is what you put in your body and


75
0:3:42,76 --> 0:3:43,689
what you eat


76
0:3:43,689 --> 0:3:45,11
so you can you'd like


77
0:3:45,11 --> 0:3:50,99
the six hot dogs and and do a little bit
of exercise the exercise means nothing


78
0:3:50,99 --> 0:3:53,549
site and by the winters in connecticut
california massachusetts


79
0:3:53,549 --> 0:3:57,27
so the richest states in the country
there on the most fit


80
0:3:57,27 --> 0:3:58,699
cop so


81
0:3:58,699 --> 0:5:58,699
as part of it
