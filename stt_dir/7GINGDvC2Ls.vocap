###23 NIALL ROWNTREE: We see the animal's motionless.
###24 There's no life signs.
###26 But just to be sure, you touch the eye.
###29 The animal's completely dead.
###32 OK?
###33 No suffering, nice clean kill.
###37 ALEX MILLER: Where's the bullet hole?
###37 NIALL ROWNTREE: The bullet hole is exactly where you were
###39 told to put it.
###40 The bullet hole's there.
###42 So it was where you were practicing this morning.
###45 
###62 NIALL ROWNTREE: The tragic thing with this is we couldn't
###63 get the [INAUDIBLE]
###64 in white.
###66 
###71 ALEX MILLER: Yeah.
###73 It's dead now.
###74 NIALL ROWNTREE: Yeah.
###74 ALEX MILLER: Cutting it's just like slicing a steak.
###75 NIALL ROWNTREE: Exactly.
###76 The first thing we're gonna do is we're
###77 gonna bleed the animal.
###78 So we do that with [INAUDIBLE] top of the breastbone with the
###80 knife there [INAUDIBLE], OK?
###81 Did you see that?
###83 
###88 And if you remove your hat, my friend, this is the
###92 bit you came for.
###93 You put that on your head [INAUDIBLE], and you can shake
###96 my hand if you wish.
###98 And you've joined the elite club.
###101 ALEX MILLER: Murder club.
###103 NIALL ROWNTREE: OK, make an incision and cut all the way
###106 up to the [INAUDIBLE].
###107 We start the breastbone.
###109 Turn her sideways.
###110 
###114 And what you can do here is put your hand on the top of it
###116 and give it a push down like that [INAUDIBLE].
###121 And what you'll do here is you'll do a quick check on the
###123 health of the animal.
###124 What you're looking at that there, the stomach of the
###126 animal is quite healthy.
###128 So that's your first indication that this animal,
###129 having killed it, is perfectly OK for the human food chain.
###132 
###150 ALEX MILLER: Death buggy.
###151 1, 2, 3.
###153 
###159 NIALL ROWNTREE: We're off.
###159 Ready?
###160 ALEX MILLER: Yeah.
###161 
###168 Right, now we're bringing my kill back to the base, where
###174 we're gonna slit it up and turn it into real, genuine
###179 chunks of meat.
###181 I can really smell deer blood on my face.
###186 This seems a lot kinder than battery farming or
###190 something like that.
###191 They just throw chickens into tiny, little fences and let
###196 them eat each other and shit on each other and live and die
###200 in equal amounts of abject horror.
###205 [LAUGHTER]
###207 
###213 NIALL ROWNTREE: Well, what we'll do is we'll process the
###214 animal, clean it out.
###216 We'll take out its [INAUDIBLE]
###217 its heart, liver, and lungs.
###219 We take its head clean off, and then
###221 we'll skin the animal.
###222 [INAUDIBLE].
###224 On three.
###225 1, 2, 3.
###226 
###230 You're looking right into the womb.
###232 ALEX MILLER: Is that the womb?
###233 NIALL ROWNTREE: That's the womb there you're looking at.
###234 
###237 ALEX MILLER: Whoa.
###238 NIALL ROWNTREE: She'd have been mated in early October.
###240 ALEX MILLER: OK, so when would she give birth?
###243 NIALL ROWNTREE: She'll give birth probably around about
###246 36th of June would have been when the calf was born.
###248 
###251 ALEX MILLER: Oh, god.
###252 Oh, my god.
###253 NIALL ROWNTREE: That's [INAUDIBLE]
###253 the sack there, OK?
###254 And there's the fetus.
###255 So you can see it is a whole little deer.
###259 ALEX MILLER: Right, can I--
###259 NIALL ROWNTREE: And if you look at it carefully, you can
###262 see it's a little female.
###266 Hopefully it's [INAUDIBLE].
###268 NIALL ROWNTREE: Has it?
###269 Has it?
###270 OK.
###271 ALEX MILLER: Yeah.
###271 It's like a deer.
###271 I can feel the bones inside it.
###273 NIALL ROWNTREE: Yeah.
###274 Oh, it is like a deer.
###274 Well, it is a deer.
###275 ALEX MILLER: Yes, it is a deer.
###276 
###280 NIALL ROWNTREE: [INAUDIBLE].
###281 
###286 And there you go.
###287 It's comes out.
###288 [INAUDIBLE].
###291 That's the head off.
###292 
###299 ALEX MILLER: It's like a Giger drawing.
###301 NIALL ROWNTREE: See, that's coming off.
###303 ALEX MILLER: Yeah.
###303 What's interesting about this is that every step further we
###307 get into the kind of grotesque dismemberment, it actually
###312 becomes a lot easier to handle.
###314 
###318 NIALL ROWNTREE: There you go.
###318 [INAUDIBLE].
###319 
###322 ALEX MILLER: I feel like such a psycho.
###326 NIALL ROWNTREE: Are you glad--
###327 ALEX MILLER: I finally-- yeah, like I finally justified 25
###330 years of eating lots and lots of meat.
###334 NIALL ROWNTREE: We had a group of ladies here a couple years
###336 ago, and they asked if we could arrange testosterone
###339 courses for London [INAUDIBLE].
###341 
###344 ALEX MILLER: I'm kind of interested.
###346 I mean, I'm a little bit disturbed that I'm not more
###348 disturbed by the whole process.
###350 I thought I was gonna be feeling really squeamish.
###352 But it all seems quite natural.
###354 It seems, I don't know, just like a trade.
###358 You know what I mean?
###359 It just seems like dealing with a physical issue in a
###362 physical manner.
###363 It's all very competent, all very serious.
###367 It all makes sense, you know?
###368 NIALL ROWNTREE: Uh-huh.
###369 [BAGPIPES PLAYING]
###376 ALEX MILLER: That night was Burns' night, a night in honor
###378 of Scottish people's favorite poet.
###381 We'd been invited along, but we weren't the guest of honor.
###385 That privilege is always reserved for locally produced
###387 venison haggis.
###388 
###393 
###415 -[SINGING]
###416 [INAUDIBLE].
###419 ALEX MILLER: Everyone was getting pretty smashed, and so
###420 was I. Perhaps that's why I agreed to wear a Scottish bow
###423 tie and read a poem I'd never read full of words I didn't
###427 understand.
###427 [APPLAUSE]
###428 ALEX MILLER: I've got a couple of disabilities.
###430 The first is that I'm reading a Robert Burns poem in an
###434 English accent, and the second is that I'm quite drunk.
###436 So--
###437 [INTERPOSING VOICES]
###438 
###439 [LAUGHTER]
###440 ALEX MILLER: I think you'll find they're my
###442 special power, my friend.
###444 You'll all be wearing them in six months.
###446 Don't worry about that.
###447 -[INAUDIBLE].
###448 ALEX MILLER: [INAUDIBLE] the poem I'm gonna read is called
###450 "The Trogger."
###453 "As I come down by Annan side, intending for the border,
###457 amang the Scroggie banks and braes,
###459 what met I but a trogger.
###461 He laid me down upon my back, I thought he was but joking,
###464 till he was in me to the hilts, O the
###468 deevil tak sic troggin!
###470 What could I say, what could I do, I bann'd and sair misca'd
###474 him, but whiltie-whaltie gae'd his eye the mair that I
###479 forbade him.
###480 He stell'd his foot against a stane, and doubl'd ilka stroke
###485 in, till I gaed daft amang his hands, O the
###488 deevil tak sic troggin!
###491 Then up we raise, and took the road, and in by Ecclefechan,
###496 where the brandy-stoup we gart it clink, and the strang-beer
###500 ream the quench in.
###502 Bedown the bents o' Bonshaw braes, we took the partin'
###506 yokin'; but I've claw'd a sairy cut systine, O the
###511 deevil tak
###513 sic troggin!" [APPLAUSE]
###521 ALEX MILLER: Peace out.
