###1 There's not enough feeling or emotion in what Jacque says. That's true, there isn't. But
###10 if you're emotionally attached to something, it means you're subjective. There are people
###17 that nail pieces of wood together, then they kiss it, before that, they don't kiss it.
###23 Till you nail it so it looks like a cross, then you kiss it. You know what I mean? So,
###29 what was the day before it was a cross? 2 pieces of wood, or some copper that wasn't
###35 cast in a form of a cross. And a cross is a crucifix which was long before people wore
###44 it, it was to crucify people, so it was a symbolic, depending on what culture you come
###52 from. That's why I can't accept anything except the sciences - the shape of an airplane wing
###60 is designed for a certain lift. The shape of the plane is designed for certain conditions.
###68 So, you can't - when I say you can't exceed your environment, that means you can't exceed
###76 what you've been exposed to. You can't, if somebody gave you a brand new microscope,
###82 and you said the objective lenses are insufficient. If you're a cannibal, you know what I mean?
###90 If you give a cannibal a watch. He doesn't look at it and say, "the gears are not precise,
###97 they're 10,000th of an inch off" - he can't say that. That's what I mean by a person can't
###104 exceed their environment. If you got in an airplane if you're able to, you know, 2000
###112 years from now, a guy might look at our plane and say "I'll never get into that crate."
###120 Our airplanes would come through as a crate, or something else. But certainly, if you're
###127 born 2000 years from now, you couldn't have same values and survive. The nation that can't
###137 exceed it's own environment will be surpassed. Do you know what that means? Another country
###144 will surpass us. If China can't get passed where they're at, if they stop and just take
###151 in manufacturing and don't go into automation and modification, they will remain. There
###158 are many nations out there that are so primitive they do things the way they did a thousand
###166 years ago, and that's up the Amazon river. The natives build rafts the same way they
###173 did a thousand years ago, no change. They bond a bundle of read together, tie it all
###181 together, cause that's all they ever see, they never leave the area. So if you say "they're
###191 stupid" - no they're not, they live in a fixed environment, where things are fairly uniform
###205 and not enough change. They don't have visitors from other tribes that bring them other things,
###205 otherwise they might be brought up to hate other tribes or they might be brought up to
###209 trade. The nations that trade undergo change, cause they meet people that are different,
###215 and they get things that are different. No nation all developed a vase. If a nation developed
###224 a vase and you're nation didn't, and they show you how they carry water, orange juice
###229 around, you don't have any means of doing it except this way, so you undergo change.
###236 The more nations that meet and share ideas, not just meet, if they share ideas they undergo
###243 modification. But if my people undergo too much modification, I can't control them, so
###252 I put a fence around my country and keep out forgein ideologies. Or if books that come
###259 into my country that change people, so I can't control them, I forbid pornography or whatever
###265 it is I forbid. Am I right, am I wrong? All nations wish to survive, they can't if people
###277 read different kinds of books, different kinds of characters, different kinds of social systems,
###284 you can't control your people that way. So you say "I believe in democracy" nobody believes
###291 in democracy, they believe in what they've been conditioned to believe in. They can't
###296 believe in democracy otherwise they go hear communism, socialism, free love and all, they'd
###303 say "I don't know enough about them to make up my mind which is right" they'd speak like
###309 that - "I don't know enough about it." Do you understand what I'm saying? I'm upsetting
###315 the apple cart, so that there are no values except the values that preserve nature man
###322 and his relationship to his fellow man and nature. This is the only laws I know of, well
###329 if you don't care of the forest, we let them burn and die, we will suffer. If we polute
###335 the oceans, we will suffer, those are things I accept. I don't know any other system. Will
###344 they do that in the future? I think they'll control things in the future, weather, hurricanes,
###349 earthquakes, everything. Man will learn to control things, in his behalf, not - the other
###358 organisms that he keeps alive would be supportive to that culture, do you understand that? That's
###366 why it'd be very difficult to deal with people who came from another planet, with a different
###372 gavitational field, different lighting systems, if they develop - they don't have to look
###379 like us, whatever they develop they'd be reflecting their culture. So a guy says, I'd like to
###385 share ideas with you, well only if they lived here and they had all kinds of methods of
###393 evaluation. But they wouldn't want to associate with us because we're too limitted. If they've
###402 been around longer. So, I can't say that Fresco tells the truth, I can only say that Fresco's
###410 world is based upon survey, related to man and his relationship to the environment. That's
###418 what I mean by mechanistic. Cause I asked once, a writer of a scientific book, "you
###426 think man is a machine?" he says "that's the old mechanistic point of view that man is
###432 a machine." He didn't say "what do you mean by machine?" There was no semantics at the
###438 time, you know what I mean? To know what a man is talking about. By machine I mean that
###445 the eyes can not move to that position unless there's a muscle that pulls it there, unless
###450 there's a mechanism in the brain, or a bright light cause the eye to look at it. So I want
###457 to make little dolls, with little magnets in their heads, you don't see, if I hold a
###462 magnet there, the eyes will focus on it, if I move it, but not really. Normal people would
###470 think gee the machine is looking at where ever you hold that. I can simulate that. You
###478 can make a machine to have facial expressions in sympathy. If you say "I bought a new car
###484 and I lost it, i forgot to put the brakes on, it went off a" - the machines eyebrows
###488 change - say "my god, I'm sorry to hear that"  - but it won't feel anything. It'll react
###497 as though it felt something. A machine can't feel. Bad or good about you, it can only react
###505 to the way it's circuits are built. Do you understand that? That's why a machine will
###512 never say I'm going to take over, cause it doesn't have ambition. It doesn't say "your
###518 wife is prettier than mine", or "that machine looks nicer than the other machine" it has
###524 no such reaction, nor can it be given that. No matter how you circuit a machine it can
###531 say that, "that machine is rusting, and it's going to disintegrate" and it can even cry,
###538 but it won't feel anything. It's like a movie of an actor doing, and you know that he didn't
###546 lose his wife, and he didn't get shot, although he got shot in the movie, the movie can't
###553 feel, it can simulate feeling and that's why a person says, "he's a good actor" meaning
###560 he can get you to cry or she can get you to cry. Y'say "they're good actors," and sometimes
###568 people use that in marrying a rich man, a girl might say "you're so wonderful, I love
###575 you" and the rich man feels flattered and he marries her, then she spends a lot of money
###584 on a lot of things. That's simulating love. Do you know what I mean? A prostitute that
###591 says "you're a lousy lay" after the day is over, you won't come back. She says "I really
###596 enjoyed that sexual" - you know, after all there are people that simulate good and bad,
###605 right and wrong. Knowing the difference is difficult, if they're good at it. A salesman
###611 who sells you something, simulates being your friend "let me advise you that the Ford car
###618 is better built than any other car today, believe me, I'm doing you a favor" is he a
###624 car salesman? Or a fireman? You know, what is he? If he's a salesman and a church goer,
###633 that believes in god, he'll say "I say a chevy's best if you live in rough terrain, or a jeap'd
###641 be better than a chevy" you know what I mean? That's an honest guy. He says "that's what
###646 I know about cars" but a person can't work for general motors and say "get yourself an
###653 Italian car" I bought a Totra a Czechoslovakian car, you know the Totra? I bought it and a
###663 mechanic said "I'm not gunna work on your car, it's from a communist country" he said
###671 that to me. I said "is there a communist shit? Or a Greek shit? Or a Greek pain? Or a communist
###681 pain?" there's no such thing as communist science or Czechoslovakian science, there's
###688 only science and they call people scientists that are not generalists, that are in one
###696 field. He's an optical scientist. He knows how to grind lenses. But he's not a scientist.
###705 To me a scientist's one who's interested in everything, has loyality to methodology. That
###711 means, if a Greek comes up with a cure for cancer you honor him. If a Japenese scientist
###718 comes up with a cure for cancer, you honor him. You honor any human being worthy of honor.
###724 but you don't honor only your own kind. He was an american, that's what I like about
###732 it. Patriotism pulls a shield up infront of us so we can't see things as they are. We
###739 can't even hear the differences of nations. We get mad at them. If they don't uphold american
###745 values, or our concepts of freedom and democracy, we get mad at people and that's what they
###752 want you to do. They want you to have loyality to what they teach. But if you have loyality
###758 to methodology, you get rid of a fountain pen, if it leaks and you buy a ballpoint pen,
###766 because no matter where it was invented if it works better than the other pen, you use
###772 it. If Filipinos come up with a new type of eye glass, that gives you better vision, you
###778 use it. You honor them, because you don't  - "gee I hope a Greek did it, 'cause I'm
###783 greek." You blind yourself. You understand? I don't like traditional Jews, or traditional
###791 Catholics, or traditional Americans, you understand? Or any traditional group. But not because
###798 they're Filipinos, because of their values, and the values they pick up. So if you discriminate
###807  - "I don't wanna live nextdoor to a clansman, because he's - let's go out and beatup a Jew
###815 or a nigger or a Filipino, or any damn foreigner" I don't find that fulfilling, I find that
###822 to be a limitted viewpoint. Racial prejudice is like patriotism toward a certain race.
###830 "I'm a Greek and I'm proud of it" once you do that, you damage a person. Say "I'm a Greek,
###838 and I like certain Greeks, and Filipinos, and certain blacks, and certain Italians"
###843  - if you meet Italian gangsters you say "Italians are gangsters" that's when you're projecting,
###849 one set of values into all Italians. Anyway, that ought to give you some perspective of
###857 the world you live in.
