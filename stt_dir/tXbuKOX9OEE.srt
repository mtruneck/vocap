[MUSIC PLAYING]


2
0:0:1,51 --> 0:0:4,625
So why is it that you guys are
so infatuated with fire.


3
0:0:4,625 --> 0:0:7,28
It seems like every time we do
an experiment, your comment


4
0:0:7,28 --> 0:0:10,17
is, more fire, we need more--
well, truth be told, I'm


5
0:0:10,17 --> 0:0:11,61
infatuated with fire as well.


6
0:0:11,61 --> 0:0:15,28
And this is the kind of episode
where most shows would


7
0:0:15,28 --> 0:0:16,85
say, don't try anything
at home.


8
0:0:16,85 --> 0:0:18,24
And that's kind of
the problem.


9
0:0:18,24 --> 0:0:20,0
This is what we want you
to be able to try.


10
0:0:20,0 --> 0:0:21,57
So, a couple things said.


11
0:0:21,57 --> 0:0:23,25
You're going to be using
flammable materials.


12
0:0:23,25 --> 0:0:25,5
There's a couple things
that you need.


13
0:0:25,5 --> 0:0:26,4
First of all, safety glasses.


14
0:0:26,4 --> 0:0:29,56
And secondly, you need
a fire extinguisher.


15
0:0:29,56 --> 0:0:32,479
You don't have those two, you
can't do this at home.


16
0:0:32,479 --> 0:0:34,5
And third, if you're a kid,
you got to have adult


17
0:0:34,5 --> 0:0:35,12
supervision.


18
0:0:35,12 --> 0:0:39,21
If you're an adult who is
careless, you need to have a


19
0:0:39,21 --> 0:0:42,0
better adult to give you better
adult supervision.


20
0:0:42,0 --> 0:0:42,96
Make sense?


21
0:0:42,96 --> 0:0:43,74
I think you're going like this.


22
0:0:43,74 --> 0:0:44,27
Watch.


23
0:0:44,27 --> 0:0:45,17
So here are the things
we need.


24
0:0:45,17 --> 0:0:46,7
So we need some isopropyl
alcohol--


25
0:0:46,7 --> 0:0:49,3
this is just rubbing
alcohol, 70%--


26
0:0:49,3 --> 0:0:51,98
something to mix it in, water--
just in case we get


27
0:0:51,98 --> 0:0:52,91
into trouble--


28
0:0:52,91 --> 0:0:55,15
some tongs, and of course,
the lighter.


29
0:0:55,15 --> 0:0:56,45
So here's what happens,
let's start


30
0:0:56,45 --> 0:0:58,3
with the rubbing alcohol.


31
0:0:58,3 --> 0:1:2,1
And now, we need something
that will catch on fire.


32
0:1:2,1 --> 0:1:3,88
Ah, this is perfect.


33
0:1:3,88 --> 0:1:5,43
Lunch money.


34
0:1:5,43 --> 0:1:8,45
I don't know even a lunch that
you could buy using a dollar,


35
0:1:8,45 --> 0:1:10,76
but a long time ago, this, I
guess, was your lunch money.


36
0:1:10,76 --> 0:1:12,68
All right, so this goes down--


37
0:1:12,68 --> 0:1:14,8
and you always borrow this.


38
0:1:14,8 --> 0:1:16,32
This is where we say, don't try
this at home, try it at a


39
0:1:16,32 --> 0:1:17,33
friend's home, right?


40
0:1:17,33 --> 0:1:20,12
Well you always use a friend's
bill as well.


41
0:1:20,12 --> 0:1:22,69
So you say, can I please borrow
some money, and they,


42
0:1:22,69 --> 0:1:24,28
of course, will only
give you a dollar.


43
0:1:24,28 --> 0:1:26,74
It's a hundred times better if
you could get a hundred dollar


44
0:1:26,74 --> 0:1:28,46
bill, but good luck.


45
0:1:28,46 --> 0:1:29,74
So this dips down inside.


46
0:1:29,74 --> 0:1:31,895
This is our flammable
material, here.


47
0:1:31,895 --> 0:1:32,27
OK.


48
0:1:32,27 --> 0:1:33,38
You ready?


49
0:1:33,38 --> 0:1:34,21
Watch this.


50
0:1:34,21 --> 0:1:36,2
This is off to the
side like this.


51
0:1:36,2 --> 0:1:39,232
And now let's light it
and see what happens.


52
0:1:39,232 --> 0:1:41,96
Oh, that's a nice flame,
looks good.


53
0:1:41,96 --> 0:1:43,6
And--


54
0:1:43,6 --> 0:1:44,89
perfect.


55
0:1:44,89 --> 0:1:45,53
It's out.


56
0:1:45,53 --> 0:1:47,31
Well, there was a little
bit of trickery.


57
0:1:47,31 --> 0:1:49,84
Although we used all the
materials that you see on the


58
0:1:49,84 --> 0:1:52,25
table, if you had done it
exactly the way I just showed


59
0:1:52,25 --> 0:1:53,62
you, there would have
been a problem.


60
0:1:53,62 --> 0:1:55,2
And I'll show you what
that looks like.


61
0:1:55,2 --> 0:1:58,1
We actually used a real dollar
bill, but this solution here


62
0:1:58,1 --> 0:2:1,19
isn't actually just 70%
rubbing alcohol.


63
0:2:1,19 --> 0:2:3,53
Let me show you what would
happen if you would have used


64
0:2:3,53 --> 0:2:5,42
real rubbing alcohol in
its full strength.


65
0:2:5,42 --> 0:2:8,7



66
0:2:8,7 --> 0:2:10,49
Now we pull it out of the
way so that nothing


67
0:2:10,49 --> 0:2:12,14
else catches on fire.


68
0:2:12,14 --> 0:2:16,5
Watch what happens with
pure rubbing alcohol.


69
0:2:16,5 --> 0:2:18,44
It burns and it burns.


70
0:2:18,44 --> 0:2:23,49
And then, it continues to burn,
and it burns, and you'll


71
0:2:23,49 --> 0:2:25,75
notice that it continues
to burn.


72
0:2:25,75 --> 0:2:29,83
And well, this is a problem,
because now you've destroyed


73
0:2:29,83 --> 0:2:32,35
money, and you might think
that there's going to be


74
0:2:32,35 --> 0:2:34,48
another problem on
top of that.


75
0:2:34,48 --> 0:2:37,91
Come to find out, the way the
law reads, you can destroy


76
0:2:37,91 --> 0:2:39,24
money and not go to jail.


77
0:2:39,24 --> 0:2:41,955
You just can't destroy money
and try to pass it.


78
0:2:41,955 --> 0:2:43,34
That's counterfeit, right.


79
0:2:43,34 --> 0:2:46,79
And I think you can see there's
just no possible way


80
0:2:46,79 --> 0:2:49,18
that I think you can
probably pass that.


81
0:2:49,18 --> 0:2:51,12
You know as a kid, you would
take a penny and you'd go to


82
0:2:51,12 --> 0:2:54,4
the circus or that place, and
you'd put it in that machine


83
0:2:54,4 --> 0:2:56,92
and crank it, and it would
flatten the penny and put a


84
0:2:56,92 --> 0:2:59,57
logo on there or you just got
a name or your birthday, or


85
0:2:59,57 --> 0:3:0,56
whatever it is.


86
0:3:0,56 --> 0:3:3,44
That is kind of the same thing
that we're doing here.


87
0:3:3,44 --> 0:3:7,445
It's destroying the penny, but
by law, that's OK to do


88
0:3:7,445 --> 0:3:9,19
because you'd never take
that penny and then


89
0:3:9,19 --> 0:3:10,24
try to pass it again.


90
0:3:10,24 --> 0:3:10,83
Same thing here.


91
0:3:10,83 --> 0:3:11,76
We're not trying to pass it.


92
0:3:11,76 --> 0:3:13,66
The whole goal is that you're
not lighting the


93
0:3:13,66 --> 0:3:14,75
bill on fire at all.


94
0:3:14,75 --> 0:3:16,675
I just wanted you to see what
would happen if you really had


95
0:3:16,675 --> 0:3:18,8
done it the way I told you.


96
0:3:18,8 --> 0:3:19,35
Here's the secret.


97
0:3:19,35 --> 0:3:22,8
First of all, 70% rubbing
alcohol-- isopropyl alcohol--


98
0:3:22,8 --> 0:3:26,9
means that there's seven parts
of the isopropyl alcohol to


99
0:3:26,9 --> 0:3:27,57
three parts water, right.


100
0:3:27,57 --> 0:3:29,22
So there's already water
in this mixture.


101
0:3:29,22 --> 0:3:31,41
And at the very beginning, I
said, this is everything that


102
0:3:31,41 --> 0:3:32,11
you'll need.


103
0:3:32,11 --> 0:3:34,18
The secret was sitting in front
of you the entire time


104
0:3:34,18 --> 0:3:35,61
and it was actually
right here.


105
0:3:35,61 --> 0:3:38,45
It's the water that's
in this pitcher.


106
0:3:38,45 --> 0:3:42,38
What we want is we want to add
more water to the isopropyl


107
0:3:42,38 --> 0:3:44,68
alcohol so that what
happens is that we


108
0:3:44,68 --> 0:3:46,84
burn off that fuel--


109
0:3:46,84 --> 0:3:50,96
but by the time the fuel burns
off, the evaporating water


110
0:3:50,96 --> 0:3:52,9
that has coated the
dollar bill as


111
0:3:52,9 --> 0:3:54,45
well begins to evaporate.


112
0:3:54,45 --> 0:3:57,56
And as it begins to evaporate,
it cools the bill down.


113
0:3:57,56 --> 0:3:59,44
So here's the mixture that
you're going to need.


114
0:3:59,44 --> 0:4:2,2
This all varies, so you're going
to have to experiment a


115
0:4:2,2 --> 0:4:2,49
little bit.


116
0:4:2,49 --> 0:4:6,0
And I think you can do the
dollar to experiment.


117
0:4:6,0 --> 0:4:9,99
Here's 70% rubbing alcohol,
and we're going to add--


118
0:4:9,99 --> 0:4:11,81
I'm going to put about
300 milliliters.


119
0:4:11,81 --> 0:4:15,4
I'm going to add about 200
milliliters, which again, is


120
0:4:15,4 --> 0:4:18,18
going to be about 3/4 of a cup
if you're doing it that way,


121
0:4:18,18 --> 0:4:20,1
of water, and there's
your mixture.


122
0:4:20,1 --> 0:4:23,7
It looks just like rubbing
alcohol, and that entire


123
0:4:23,7 --> 0:4:25,97
mixture got put back
into the bottle.


124
0:4:25,97 --> 0:4:28,25
So I hadn't dumped that last
little part out and put it


125
0:4:28,25 --> 0:4:31,36
back into bottle so that you
didn't know that I had done


126
0:4:31,36 --> 0:4:32,44
anything to it.


127
0:4:32,44 --> 0:4:33,67
There is a little secret.


128
0:4:33,67 --> 0:4:36,74
If you use this mixture right
here, it's going to burn


129
0:4:36,74 --> 0:4:39,21
awfully blue, so you
need some salt.


130
0:4:39,21 --> 0:4:41,48
And if you put some salt inside,
the sodium from the


131
0:4:41,48 --> 0:4:43,6
salt will help kind of
color it yellow.


132
0:4:43,6 --> 0:4:46,46
The salt dissolves with
no problem at all.


133
0:4:46,46 --> 0:4:47,47
Good.


134
0:4:47,47 --> 0:4:48,72
And now just kind
of stir it up.


135
0:4:48,72 --> 0:4:52,32



136
0:4:52,32 --> 0:4:52,46
All right.


137
0:4:52,46 --> 0:4:55,37
Now our special watered-down
mixture goes


138
0:4:55,37 --> 0:4:58,28
back into the container.


139
0:4:58,28 --> 0:4:59,81
That's perfect.


140
0:4:59,81 --> 0:5:1,63
And now we're ready to go.


141
0:5:1,63 --> 0:5:4,24
This is the set up.


142
0:5:4,24 --> 0:5:6,78
This looks awfully science-y,
so you could


143
0:5:6,78 --> 0:5:8,18
substitute a bowl.


144
0:5:8,18 --> 0:5:9,23
That'll be perfect.


145
0:5:9,23 --> 0:5:10,72
You need a friend's
dollar bill.


146
0:5:10,72 --> 0:5:11,87
Friend?


147
0:5:11,87 --> 0:5:13,5
Got a dollar bill, that's
perfect, and now


148
0:5:13,5 --> 0:5:14,36
you're ready to go.


149
0:5:14,36 --> 0:5:14,91
All right.


150
0:5:14,91 --> 0:5:17,48
So now we put the mixture out.


151
0:5:17,48 --> 0:5:19,5
Again, we're telling them
that, look, it's


152
0:5:19,5 --> 0:5:20,5
just rubbing alcohol.


153
0:5:20,5 --> 0:5:22,265
But you know that it's
a mixture of


154
0:5:22,265 --> 0:5:23,81
rubbing alcohol and water.


155
0:5:23,81 --> 0:5:24,92
And now, here's the
cool thing.


156
0:5:24,92 --> 0:5:27,36
When you take this, the secret
is you've got to completely


157
0:5:27,36 --> 0:5:28,88
soak the dollar bill.


158
0:5:28,88 --> 0:5:31,81
If you don't soak the dollar
bill, then it's easy for it to


159
0:5:31,81 --> 0:5:32,52
catch on fire.


160
0:5:32,52 --> 0:5:34,51
So just make sure it's
completely soaked.


161
0:5:34,51 --> 0:5:38,45
Move this container off to the
side, and now we're simply


162
0:5:38,45 --> 0:5:40,3
going to light this on fire.


163
0:5:40,3 --> 0:5:42,6
What's going to burn, instead
of the dollar


164
0:5:42,6 --> 0:5:43,34
bill, is the fuel.


165
0:5:43,34 --> 0:5:45,1
Look at that nice yellow
kind of look there.


166
0:5:45,1 --> 0:5:46,63
And--


167
0:5:46,63 --> 0:5:48,6
it's perfectly fine.


168
0:5:48,6 --> 0:5:50,35
Now if you're trying this and
you see that it starts to


169
0:5:50,35 --> 0:5:53,38
burn, just shake it for a second
and it will come out,


170
0:5:53,38 --> 0:5:55,5
and you may have to tweak
the formula just


171
0:5:55,5 --> 0:5:56,31
a little tiny bit.


172
0:5:56,31 --> 0:5:58,6
But your dollar bill is back.


173
0:5:58,6 --> 0:6:0,33
You can't tell this, but right
now, it's cool to the touch.


174
0:6:0,33 --> 0:6:3,21
So anybody who touches it will
be amazed that it feels cold.


175
0:6:3,21 --> 0:6:4,92
It was just on fire,
but it's cold.


176
0:6:4,92 --> 0:6:7,91
And of course, that adds to the
secret and kind of gives


177
0:6:7,91 --> 0:6:10,64
away that part of it, that it's
the evaporating water


178
0:6:10,64 --> 0:6:12,18
that kind of keeps this safe.


179
0:6:12,18 --> 0:6:14,58
All right, so this is the true
test of your solution, if it


180
0:6:14,58 --> 0:6:15,95
really is going to work.


181
0:6:15,95 --> 0:6:17,92
This makes you a little
bit nervous.


182
0:6:17,92 --> 0:6:19,77
All right, so there's the
hundred dollar bill.


183
0:6:19,77 --> 0:6:22,44
This goes down inside
like this.


184
0:6:22,44 --> 0:6:25,81
I'm going to make sure that
every little piece of this is


185
0:6:25,81 --> 0:6:27,772
completely soaked.


186
0:6:27,772 --> 0:6:31,5
If you paid your dues in the
local science club, you've


187
0:6:31,5 --> 0:6:32,495
done well--


188
0:6:32,495 --> 0:6:33,92
I'll move this out
of the way--


189
0:6:33,92 --> 0:6:36,49
hopefully everything
will be just fine.


190
0:6:36,49 --> 0:6:39,11
Watch.


191
0:6:39,11 --> 0:6:39,9
There it burns.


192
0:6:39,9 --> 0:6:42,702
It's looking good, it's
looking good, and--


193
0:6:42,702 --> 0:6:44,39
bam.


194
0:6:44,39 --> 0:6:44,8
It's there.


195
0:6:44,8 --> 0:6:46,8
Look at this.


196
0:6:46,8 --> 0:6:50,3
There is my good hundred
dollar bill.


197
0:6:50,3 --> 0:6:51,7
I know what you're thinking.


198
0:6:51,7 --> 0:6:53,22
Let's say you're watching us
from another country, and


199
0:6:53,22 --> 0:6:54,94
you're thinking well, does
it work with my money.


200
0:6:54,94 --> 0:6:58,15
We have this huge following in
the UK, so you just use your


201
0:6:58,15 --> 0:6:59,93
UK, your pounds.


202
0:6:59,93 --> 0:7:1,78
Do you have any pounds?


203
0:7:1,78 --> 0:7:3,85
This is a pound, got it.


204
0:7:3,85 --> 0:7:5,42
Let's see if it works.


205
0:7:5,42 --> 0:7:7,54
This goes down into the
water like this.


206
0:7:7,54 --> 0:7:9,775
I've never tried this before,
so this will be interesting.


207
0:7:9,775 --> 0:7:12,8



208
0:7:12,8 --> 0:7:14,435
OK, ready?


209
0:7:14,435 --> 0:7:16,2
This is really thin
and flimsy.


210
0:7:16,2 --> 0:7:18,32
Your money is going to be
much better than this.


211
0:7:18,32 --> 0:7:20,28
Let's just see if this is OK.


212
0:7:20,28 --> 0:7:22,304
Watch.


213
0:7:22,304 --> 0:7:23,73
That's looking pretty good.


214
0:7:23,73 --> 0:7:25,286
And--


215
0:7:25,286 --> 0:7:26,56
that's truly amazing.


216
0:7:26,56 --> 0:7:26,94
Look at that.


217
0:7:26,94 --> 0:7:31,14
With just notebook paper, it's
still perfectly fine.


218
0:7:31,14 --> 0:7:32,28
That's pretty cool.


219
0:7:32,28 --> 0:7:34,44
All right, so you want to try
this and you want to use


220
0:7:34,44 --> 0:7:35,32
paper, right?


221
0:7:35,32 --> 0:7:37,82
And you might say, I'm
not using my money--


222
0:7:37,82 --> 0:7:39,71
although that is the
best way to do it.


223
0:7:39,71 --> 0:7:42,52
You can do it the original way
that I learned how to do it


224
0:7:42,52 --> 0:7:44,74
using a man's handkerchief.


225
0:7:44,74 --> 0:7:46,55
I know you don't use these
today, but just head to the


226
0:7:46,55 --> 0:7:49,14
local department store, you can
find a piece of cloth or a


227
0:7:49,14 --> 0:7:50,5
man's handkerchief.


228
0:7:50,5 --> 0:7:53,2
We just need to have ceilings
that are higher than what you


229
0:7:53,2 --> 0:7:56,11
see here, otherwise it's going
to be a much more exciting


230
0:7:56,11 --> 0:7:58,38
science experiment than
I'd ever want.


231
0:7:58,38 --> 0:8:0,37
Let's go to bigger and
higher ceilings.


232
0:8:0,37 --> 0:8:2,87
Taller ceilings, safety glasses,
we're going to use


233
0:8:2,87 --> 0:8:6,13
the man's handkerchief, and we
need a fire extinguisher, so


234
0:8:6,13 --> 0:8:7,22
make sure that you
have a fire--


235
0:8:7,22 --> 0:8:8,41
Bo, you got a fire
extinguisher?


236
0:8:8,41 --> 0:8:9,37
OK, here's your job.


237
0:8:9,37 --> 0:8:10,17
Stand close by.


238
0:8:10,17 --> 0:8:11,27
You hang on to this.


239
0:8:11,27 --> 0:8:13,25
If anything bad happens and
I start to catch on


240
0:8:13,25 --> 0:8:15,16
fire, take me off.


241
0:8:15,16 --> 0:8:16,86
Pull the pin and
go for it, OK.


242
0:8:16,86 --> 0:8:19,29
Don't get overactive, I'm not
catching on fire, just stay


243
0:8:19,29 --> 0:8:20,96
there, all right.


244
0:8:20,96 --> 0:8:23,2
See this, so excited to maybe
get to pull the fire


245
0:8:23,2 --> 0:8:23,97
extinguisher.


246
0:8:23,97 --> 0:8:24,9
OK, here we go.


247
0:8:24,9 --> 0:8:24,8
Are we ready.


248
0:8:24,8 --> 0:8:27,44
So here is the cloth.


249
0:8:27,44 --> 0:8:32,62
Now this one here, you really
got to work on kind of getting


250
0:8:32,62 --> 0:8:33,75
it nice and wet.


251
0:8:33,75 --> 0:8:35,82
OK, nice and wet.


252
0:8:35,82 --> 0:8:39,6
And now you're going to take
this out, and we're going to


253
0:8:39,6 --> 0:8:40,85
wring it out.


254
0:8:40,85 --> 0:8:42,919



255
0:8:42,919 --> 0:8:45,3
The other thing I can tell you
is that you want to make sure


256
0:8:45,3 --> 0:8:47,49
that your hands now
are not wet.


257
0:8:47,49 --> 0:8:50,76
So now, dry your hands off.


258
0:8:50,76 --> 0:8:54,4
OK, perfect.


259
0:8:54,4 --> 0:8:56,9
Now my hands are
completely dry.


260
0:8:56,9 --> 0:8:58,81
All right, move this
out of the way.


261
0:8:58,81 --> 0:9:1,3
It's time for fire.


262
0:9:1,3 --> 0:9:6,46
Hopefully, the water will
keep it nice and safe.


263
0:9:6,46 --> 0:9:7,75
Here we go.


264
0:9:7,75 --> 0:9:9,79
Oh, this is looking good.


265
0:9:9,79 --> 0:9:11,6
So here it is.


266
0:9:11,6 --> 0:9:13,62
Now this is a pretty good flame,
you definitely don't


267
0:9:13,62 --> 0:9:15,36
want to do this in your house.


268
0:9:15,36 --> 0:9:16,54
This is outside.


269
0:9:16,54 --> 0:9:19,39
Here's the flame.


270
0:9:19,39 --> 0:9:21,11
Look at that, isn't
that awesome.


271
0:9:21,11 --> 0:9:22,54
Look.


272
0:9:22,54 --> 0:9:24,45
To the touch, it's fine.


273
0:9:24,45 --> 0:9:26,83
It's not singed.


274
0:9:26,83 --> 0:9:27,897
Ta-da.


275
0:9:27,897 --> 0:9:29,18
Take your bow.


276
0:9:29,18 --> 0:9:30,84
The secret is water.


277
0:9:30,84 --> 0:9:33,64
It keeps the material from
catching on fire.


278
0:9:33,64 --> 0:9:35,3
And whether you're doing it with
a dollar bill or you're


279
0:9:35,3 --> 0:9:37,99
doing it with a handkerchief,
the secret is trapping water


280
0:9:37,99 --> 0:9:41,46
close to the surface, because
the evaporation of that water


281
0:9:41,46 --> 0:9:43,1
produces this cooling effect.


282
0:9:43,1 --> 0:9:46,39
Water is this great
conductor of heat.


283
0:9:46,39 --> 0:9:47,65
And we're not just messing
around with this.


284
0:9:47,65 --> 0:9:49,98
This is actually being used as
a fire-fighting technique.


285
0:9:49,98 --> 0:9:53,1
They're finding ways to be able
to take water, make it


286
0:9:53,1 --> 0:9:55,63
sticky, so to speak, and to put
it on a structure like a


287
0:9:55,63 --> 0:9:57,19
building and try to keep
it from burning.


288
0:9:57,19 --> 0:9:58,82
And believe it or not,
you might have played


289
0:9:58,82 --> 0:10:0,21
with it as a toy.


290
0:10:0,21 --> 0:10:2,43
The toy is called Gravi-Goo.


291
0:10:2,43 --> 0:10:5,34
It's actually a powder that
you can see inside.


292
0:10:5,34 --> 0:10:9,12
It's really a very, very high
molecular weight polymer,


293
0:10:9,12 --> 0:10:11,19
polymer just being a long
chain of molecules.


294
0:10:11,19 --> 0:10:13,64
Look, we haven't used much there
at all, you can see that


295
0:10:13,64 --> 0:10:15,3
little bit sitting
in the bottom.


296
0:10:15,3 --> 0:10:17,82
Let me add the water.


297
0:10:17,82 --> 0:10:20,22
And now you just keep on pouring
it back and forth.


298
0:10:20,22 --> 0:10:24,23
The super-absorbent polymer will
literally pull itself out


299
0:10:24,23 --> 0:10:27,1
of the beaker like a
self-siphoning gel.


300
0:10:27,1 --> 0:10:30,15
So here's the batch that
I made previously.


301
0:10:30,15 --> 0:10:32,825
This is probably four or
five of these batches.


302
0:10:32,825 --> 0:10:35,275
And now, I'm going to get my
hands inside so we can kind of


303
0:10:35,275 --> 0:10:37,92
play with it, and you can
see what it looks like.


304
0:10:37,92 --> 0:10:42,96



305
0:10:42,96 --> 0:10:45,53
It's extremely sticky,
and it's almost


306
0:10:45,53 --> 0:10:49,19
completely made of water.


307
0:10:49,19 --> 0:10:52,51
Here's the test, nothing
terribly scientific, but


308
0:10:52,51 --> 0:10:53,49
here's our board.


309
0:10:53,49 --> 0:11:0,27
And let's take some of this
polymer in the water and put


310
0:11:0,27 --> 0:11:2,63
it on the board like this.


311
0:11:2,63 --> 0:11:4,28
Perfect.


312
0:11:4,28 --> 0:11:6,69
Now we just test it
with the fire.


313
0:11:6,69 --> 0:11:8,55
Watch the side of the board
without the polymer.


314
0:11:8,55 --> 0:11:9,8
Watch.


315
0:11:9,8 --> 0:11:14,91



316
0:11:14,91 --> 0:11:17,3
It doesn't take long at all
for that to start on fire.


317
0:11:17,3 --> 0:11:18,28
Watch this over here.


318
0:11:18,28 --> 0:11:24,1



319
0:11:24,1 --> 0:11:26,625
See, it's the heat-absorbing
properties of the water that


320
0:11:26,625 --> 0:11:28,8
are keeping the board safe.


321
0:11:28,8 --> 0:11:30,42
Now eventually, it'll catch on
fire because it will burn all


322
0:11:30,42 --> 0:11:31,4
the way through.


323
0:11:31,4 --> 0:11:37,23
But it definitely is better
than no water at all to be


324
0:11:37,23 --> 0:11:39,65
able to help mitigate
any of the damage.


325
0:11:39,65 --> 0:11:43,635
Am I saying that this toy right
here is going to save a


326
0:11:43,635 --> 0:11:44,59
burning structure?


327
0:11:44,59 --> 0:11:47,33
No, but I think the science
of it is very, very solid.


328
0:11:47,33 --> 0:11:50,425
If you can get water close to
the structure and allow the


329
0:11:50,425 --> 0:11:53,257
heat from the fire to be able
to cause the water to


330
0:11:53,257 --> 0:11:56,29
evaporate, it only makes sense
that you're going to buy time


331
0:11:56,29 --> 0:12:0,44
for firefighters as they try
to save the property.


332
0:12:0,44 --> 0:12:4,591
Who would have thought that the
science of toys could help


333
0:12:4,591 --> 0:12:8,2
possibly save a burning
structure.
