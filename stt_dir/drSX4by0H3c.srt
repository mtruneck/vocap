0:0:30,54 --> 0:0:35,22
in my forearm oozing
a purulent gleet.

0:0:35,22 --> 0:0:41,39
I stir and begin to vomit,
begging for an antidote.

I find Jean-Claude sitting
next to me.

18
0:1:19,88 --> 0:1:23,89

midday sun without water, each

If the powder did contain TTX,
the ascorbic acid in the lime
