0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:4,93



2
0:0:4,93 --> 0:0:5,96
WAKA FLOCKA: Hi, man.


3
0:0:5,96 --> 0:0:6,892
What do you do?


4
0:0:6,892 --> 0:0:8,372
It's your boy Flocka.


5
0:0:8,372 --> 0:0:12,48
My wildest party night ever.


6
0:0:12,48 --> 0:0:15,13
My first time ever I drank
Cuervo Gold, all right?


7
0:0:15,13 --> 0:0:16,5
I was like 18.


8
0:0:16,5 --> 0:0:18,622
That shit right there
had me so fucked up.


9
0:0:18,622 --> 0:0:21,8
It was at skating rink called
Golden Glove on the East Side.


10
0:0:21,8 --> 0:0:23,502
I was so drunk.


11
0:0:23,502 --> 0:0:26,44
I swear to God, I was seeing
leprechauns and shit.


12
0:0:26,44 --> 0:0:30,946
And I had to pee, so I took
my shoe off, pissed in my


13
0:0:30,946 --> 0:0:34,72
sneaker, and put my fucking
shoe back on.


14
0:0:34,72 --> 0:0:35,8
I didn't even know it.


15
0:0:35,8 --> 0:0:36,62
I went home with a girl--


16
0:0:36,62 --> 0:0:37,7
[INAUDIBLE] girl at the time.


17
0:0:37,7 --> 0:0:39,89
So I come back, and [INAUDIBLE]
like, maybe


18
0:0:39,89 --> 0:0:40,91
somebody pissed.


19
0:0:40,91 --> 0:0:42,23
Man, you pissed?


20
0:0:42,23 --> 0:0:43,15
My foot felt wet.


21
0:0:43,15 --> 0:0:44,3
FEMALE SPEAKER: What's
wrong with you, Waka?


22
0:0:44,3 --> 0:0:46,88
WAKA FLOCKA: I was like, oh.


23
0:0:46,88 --> 0:0:47,57
That shit was crazy.


24
0:0:47,57 --> 0:0:49,33
I never drunk Cuervo
Gold to this day.


25
0:0:49,33 --> 0:2:49,33
