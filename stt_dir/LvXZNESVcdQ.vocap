###3 STEVE SPANGLER: So I woke up this morning thinking about
###5 this, a little Alka-Seltzer and some film canisters.
###12 Actually, it's something I did in my son's fourth
###14 grade class last week.
###18 Imagine 25 kids dropping Alka-Seltzer into this,
###22 another one of these like this, and then just
###25 letting them go.
###26 Ready?
###27 Go!
###28 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###29 STEVE SPANGLER: Bam!
###30 There's one.
###32 Yikes!
###33 Come on.
###34 Why can't they all go at one time?
###35 There's two.
###36 Now that was a cool one.
###39 See, what's stupid about that is that, if you pop it in that
###41 direction, it just throws water everywhere.
###44 And this is why kids like this so much.
###46 So here I was in my son's fourth grade class.
###49 And I'm showing them Newton's law, because they're going to
###51 do this whole unit on rockets.
###53 And we're doing, for every action, there's an equal and
###54 opposite reaction.
###55 And while I'm trying to show them that, kids are wanting to
###59 find out what these are, because they don't know what
###61 these little things are.
###62 And I'm calling them film canisters, because that's what
###63 they're called.
###64 Little did I realize that, if you're in fourth grade now,
###66 you've probably never seen your parent use
###69 35 millimeter film.
###70 You have no idea that it's a film canister.
###73 This week, it's all about flying film canisters.
###75 I want to show you some cool things to be able to do with
###77 them, a way to be able to launch a bunch of them at one
###80 time, and what happens if you take it to an extreme level.
###82 While this is fun, what if you could do this
###84 with a trash can?
###86 So here's everything you need, just some Alka-Seltzer.
###88 You can find the generic stuff.
###90 It's an effervescent tablet.
###91 You're going to need to have some film canisters and, of
###93 course, some water.
###94 The cool thing about this is that you get the reaction
###97 without using vinegar and baking soda.
###99 So your traditional vinegar and baking soda would work in
###102 here just fine, but this means that the Alka-Seltzer tablet
###105 reacts with water.
###107 Inside the Alka-Seltzer tablet is sodium bicarbonate, which
###110 is baking soda.
###111 But they also put some powdered citric acid.
###113 And those two combined dry are just fine.
###116 But they have to be careful of these as they're packaging
###118 them, making sure there's no moisture that gets in.
###121 You can always tell Alka-Seltzer that has been
###122 tampered with and the moisture has gotten inside, because the
###126 package will pop up.
###127 And many times, they'll explode like those little--
###129 you know those packets that you hit and the little bombs?
###131 And they get bigger and bigger.
###132 And then they finally explode.
###134 So it's very, very simple.
###135 Of course, the water goes inside.
###136 What's kind of cool is to just vary the amount of water
###138 inside, because you want to know what gives you the
###140 biggest bang.
###141 In this particular case, we could even divide the tablet
###143 into quarters.
###144 There's still enough pressure that's inside to
###146 be able to do this.
###148 And now we've got the reaction.
###149 I could either figure out how high the top pops off, or
###153 watch this.
###154 I can actually take a tube.
###156 So here's a little plastic tube.
###157 This can go inside and go upside down like this.
###160 So when it pops, ultimately, the cap stays there.
###164 The entire lid comes off.
###166 And we get a nice little pop that looks this way.
###168 If I do it the other way--
###169 
###171 I think we took out a light.
###174 If we do it this way, then, of course, then it just throws
###177 water everywhere.
###178 So this sits in and it--
###180 See, that's really cool, because it shoots off.
###182 And so it's more like a little rocket, which means this idea
###185 is fantastic as well.
###186 Look at this, just different ways to be able to make it.
###188 Here's the film canister here.
###190 But you'll notice that there's an actual pill vial here and,
###193 I don't know, some little thing for the cap and some
###196 fins here on the side.
###197 So now watch.
###198 This will go in perfect.
###201 Now the Alka-Seltzer goes in like this.
###203 Got it.
###204 The whole thing goes upside down.
###205 And you're just going to put the lid on, shake
###207 the whole thing up.
###209 Now you wait for that bad boy to go.
###211 You can actually see the bubbling inside.
###214 Newton was right.
###214 For every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction.
###218 See, if that reaction is cool, then it means that 10 of them
###221 at once would be fantastic.
###223 50 of them would be amazing.
###225 This just means that we need more people.
###227 And I think I know where to go get more people.
###230 All right, so here's the idea.
###231 I just want to launch a bunch of them at one time.
###234 And I can't put them down fast enough.
###236 That's why I've just asked a few friends to stop doing
###239 their work making science gadgets and to come and help
###242 me with this.
###242 Fair enough?
###243 All right, so everybody around the table.
###244 Grab the new little canisters.
###247 Everybody grab one.
###248 Dump it out.
###248 Put the safety glasses on.
###249 You need safety glasses.
###251 And we'll fill them up with water, OK?
###254 We couldn't find enough of these film canisters, so we
###256 actually had them made.
###257 So these are film canisters, believe it or not, that are
###260 made just to do what we're talking about today.
###263 There you go.
###263 Here's some more.
###264 All right, half full, half full, let's do, I don't know,
###269 15, 20 more?
###270 FEMALE SPEAKER: Yeah.
###271 
###274 STEVE SPANGLER: Dump those out.
###275 FEMALE SPEAKER: Those are hot.
###276 MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, some are.
###277 Some aren't and some are--
###278 [LAUGHTER]
###279 STEVE SPANGLER: Now you just halve them.
###280 So you're going to need half for each one.
###283 All right, on your marks, get set, drop them in.
###286 Drop, drop, drop, drop, drop.
###288 Drop them all in first.
###289 Cap them.
###290 Cap them.
###291 Oh, somebody's bad.
###293 Cap them.
###294 Cap them.
###294 And ready, set go!
###295 [SCREAMS]
###295 [LAUGHTER]
###299 STEVE SPANGLER: Put them upside down.
###300 Go faster!
###301 [LAUGHTER]
###301 STEVE SPANGLER: Yeah.
###303 [LAUGHTER]
###307 [CHEERS]
###308 STEVE SPANGLER: That's perfect.
###312 This is just a mess, all right?
###314 So I was looking for huge popping all over the place.
###317 This is what happens when you can't launch them
###319 all at the same time.
###320 I have a friend, however.
###321 His name is Science Bob.
###322 And he claims to be able to do a bunch of film canisters all
###325 at one time.
###326 And there's a little trick he has with magnets.
###328 I think you'll like it.
###329 Take a look at this.
###330 SCIENCE BOB: With a little creativity, I found a way that
###332 we actually just need one person.
###334 A regular film canister with the water in it.
###337 And then into that goes this acrylic spacer.
###340 That will keep the tablet separated from the water.
###343 The tablet goes on top.
###344 And then the cap goes on.
###347 And then a magnet goes on here, which will put that on
###349 to the bottom of a board.
###351 And then all we've got to do is flip the board over.
###354 And our chemicals will mix.
###356 But I don't think my classroom has quite enough vertical
###359 space for this one.
###360 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###361 SCIENCE BOB: I've snuck into the auditorium
###363 here to try this out.
###364 Underneath this board are 200 film canisters with the little
###369 spacer in them, the Alka-Seltzer, and the water.
###371 When I flip this over, they'll mix.
###373 And we should launch 200 of these film canisters, more or
###376 less, again, all at once.
###378 Are you ready?
###379 Here we go.
###381 There they are.
###382 I'll flip them over.
###384 I'd better get out of the way here.
###386 All right.
###387 Well, see?
###387 There's a little one.
###389 There they go.
###389 Oh, now they're going.
###390 That was good.
###391 Oh, that's awesome.
###392 Look at that.
###394 That's crazy.
###396 Oh my gosh.
###396 Look at that.
###397 
###400 See?
###401 Just one last one.
###403 All right.
###404 That was awesome.
###405 Where do you guys keep the brooms?
###408 Brooms?
###409 Are they over here?
###410 Brooms?
###412 STEVE SPANGLER: All right, as cool as Science Bob's idea is
###414 for launching all those film canisters at one time, I had a
###417 television producer here recently that wanted me to
###419 launch the can, but this is the can that he
###423 wanted me to launch.
###424 This is a trash can.
###425 And I don't care how much Alka-Seltzer you try to put in
###427 there, what kind of seal you can get across the top, I just
###430 couldn't get a good launch on something like this.
###432 So we headed out to the parking lot.
###434 And the other thing that we thought that we would use to
###436 launch it, since the Alka-Seltzer is nothing but
###438 compressed air, actually, compressed carbon dioxide, we
###441 thought, could we compress air in such a way that we could
###443 cause this to launch up into the air.
###446 We knew that most of the air is made of nitrogen, so why
###448 not launch it with nitrogen?
###449 It's not going to be bad for the environment.
###451 The only problem is you've got to change it from a gas to a
###454 liquid and allow it to expand.
###456 This is the part of the program I have to tell you,
###458 don't try this at home.
###459 We got this video footage, because we videotape
###463 everything that we do for television and send it to the
###466 producers and get their approval.
###467 So what you're about to see was actually filmed in our
###470 parking lot.
###471 And we just let the cameras roll.
###472 And well, take a look.
###473 Here's what happened.
###475 OK, ready?
###476 Let's try it out.
###477 OK, here's what's going to happen.
###478 We're going to take it over there.
###479 We're going to cap it.
###480 And then we're going to drop it in.
###482 Ready?
###483 OK.

###539 STEVE SPANGLER: Well, I guess that wasn't
###542 really a very good idea.
###544 Just stick with the film canisters.
###546 Stay in school.
###546 Learn to read.
###547 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###548 STEVE SPANGLER: That's it.
###550 All right, it's a wrap, guys.
