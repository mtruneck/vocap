1
0:0:3,7 --> 0:0:5,998
This is our world


2
0:0:5,998 --> 0:0:11,92
a warm, comfortable, familiar place


3
0:0:11,92 --> 0:0:15,288
But walk away from the fire
and look up


4
0:0:15,288 --> 0:0:18,85
our thoughts soon leave home


5
0:0:18,85 --> 0:0:21,482
Are we just insignificant specks?


6
0:0:21,482 --> 0:0:26,776
Is the universe welcoming or hostile?


7
0:0:26,776 --> 0:0:32,271
We could stand here forever wondering


8
0:0:32,271 --> 0:0:38,364
or we could turn our back
on this beach, leave home


9
0:0:38,364 --> 0:0:46,56
to see the universe,
from here to its edge


10
0:0:46,56 --> 0:0:50,652
to discover its wonders


11
0:0:50,652 --> 0:0:55,247
confront its horrors


12
0:0:55,247 --> 0:0:59,542
beautiful new worlds


13
0:0:59,542 --> 0:1:6,935
malevolent dark forces


14
0:1:6,935 --> 0:1:10,431
the beginning of time


15
0:1:10,431 --> 0:1:14,627
the end of the world


16
0:1:14,627 --> 0:1:19,722
Would we have the courage
to see it through


17
0:1:19,722 --> 0:1:23,817
or would we run for home?


18
0:1:23,817 --> 0:1:47,593
There is only one way to find out


19
0:1:47,593 --> 0:1:50,39
The edge of space


20
0:1:50,39 --> 0:1:58,482
only 100km up,
just an hour's drive from home


21
0:1:58,482 --> 0:2:0,48
Down there, life continues


22
0:2:0,48 --> 0:2:2,278
The traffic keeps moving


23
0:2:2,278 --> 0:2:21,758
stocks go on trading
and Star Trek is still showing


24
0:2:21,758 --> 0:2:27,652
But we have to leave all this behind


25
0:2:27,652 --> 0:2:36,143
To dip our toe
into the vast dark ocean beyond


26
0:2:36,143 --> 0:2:38,94
Into the shallows


27
0:2:38,94 --> 0:2:42,237
not too far from home


28
0:2:42,237 --> 0:3:5,912
onto.. the moon


29
0:3:5,912 --> 0:3:9,509
Dozens of astronauts
have come this way before us


30
0:3:9,509 --> 0:3:15,802
12 of them have walked
on the moon itself


31
0:3:15,802 --> 0:3:19,398
Just over 400,000km from home


32
0:3:19,398 --> 0:3:21,996
3 days in a spacecraft


33
0:3:21,996 --> 0:3:29,688
So close, it's as if
we've barely left home


34
0:3:29,688 --> 0:3:32,285
Familiar, safe


35
0:3:32,285 --> 0:3:39,278
within the sight of earth


36
0:3:39,278 --> 0:3:41,975
It looks like a deserted battlefield


37
0:3:41,975 --> 0:3:46,471
bombarded by millions of
meteorites and asteroids


38
0:3:46,471 --> 0:3:48,169
But it's quieter now


39
0:3:48,169 --> 0:3:57,6
It's obvious there have been no major
collisions for millions of years


40
0:3:57,6 --> 0:3:59,58
This brings back memories


41
0:3:59,58 --> 0:4:5,351
the Apollo 11, lunar module


42
0:4:5,351 --> 0:4:9,347
Neil Armstrong's first footprints


43
0:4:9,347 --> 0:4:11,545
looks like they were made yesterday


44
0:4:11,545 --> 0:4:14,542
there is no air to change them


45
0:4:14,542 --> 0:4:19,536
They should survive for millions of years


46
0:4:19,536 --> 0:4:27,29
may be longer than us


47
0:4:27,29 --> 0:4:29,826
Our time is limited


48
0:4:29,826 --> 0:4:35,42
We need to take our own giant leap


49
0:4:35,42 --> 0:4:44,81
further than any human as ever travels


50
0:4:44,81 --> 0:4:49,406
Out of the darkness, a friendly face


51
0:4:49,406 --> 0:4:51,903
the goddess of love


52
0:4:51,903 --> 0:4:54,8
Venus


53
0:4:54,8 --> 0:4:59,595
The morning star, the evening star


54
0:4:59,595 --> 0:5:2,492
Sometimes she welcomes
the new day in the east


55
0:5:2,492 --> 0:5:6,988
others she says good night in the west


56
0:5:6,988 --> 0:5:11,683
The planet's spectacular yellow
clouds reflect the sunlight


57
0:5:11,683 --> 0:5:16,78
That's why this is the solar system's
brightest planet


58
0:5:16,78 --> 0:5:18,576
a sister to our planet


59
0:5:18,576 --> 0:5:22,771
She is about the same size
and gravity as earth


60
0:5:22,771 --> 0:5:26,867
We should be safe here


61
0:5:26,867 --> 0:5:31,462
But the Venus Express space probe
is telling us these dazzling clouds


62
0:5:31,462 --> 0:5:34,359
are made of deadly sulfuric acid


63
0:5:34,359 --> 0:5:39,55
that the planet's atmosphere
is choked with carbon dioxide


64
0:5:39,55 --> 0:5:46,647
It's ringing alarm bells


65
0:5:46,647 --> 0:5:52,541
Venus is one angry goddess


66
0:5:52,541 --> 0:5:54,938
The air is noxious,


67
0:5:54,938 --> 0:5:56,836
the pressure unbearable


68
0:5:56,836 --> 0:5:58,335
and it's hot,


69
0:5:58,335 --> 0:6:2,131
approaching 500 degree Celsius


70
0:6:2,131 --> 0:6:3,529
Stay too long


71
0:6:3,529 --> 0:6:14,418
and we'd be corroded,
suffocated, crushed and baked


72
0:6:14,418 --> 0:6:18,14
Noting can survive here


73
0:6:18,14 --> 0:6:19,513
Like this,


74
0:6:19,513 --> 0:6:22,41
it's a Soviet
Venera robotic probe


75
0:6:22,41 --> 0:6:38,194
its heavy armor has been wrecked
by the extreme atmosphere


76
0:6:38,194 --> 0:6:39,992
So lovely from earth,


77
0:6:39,992 --> 0:6:57,374
up close, this goddess is hideous


78
0:6:57,374 --> 0:6:59,971
She is the sister from hell


79
0:6:59,971 --> 0:7:3,268
pockmarked by thousands of volcanos


80
0:7:3,268 --> 0:7:7,663
All that carbon dioxide in its atmosphere
is trapping the sun's heat


81
0:7:7,663 --> 0:7:11,659
This is global warming gone wild


82
0:7:11,659 --> 0:7:14,856
Before it was cold,
maybe Venus was calm


83
0:7:14,856 --> 0:7:19,251
more like her sister planet earth


84
0:7:19,251 --> 0:7:29,74
If that's true,
this could be our planet's future


85
0:7:29,74 --> 0:7:32,437
Beginning to think
we shouldn't be out here


86
0:7:32,437 --> 0:7:35,633
that we should turn back


87
0:7:35,633 --> 0:7:39,629
But there's something
hypnotic about the sun


88
0:7:39,629 --> 0:7:45,124
Like Medusa, too terrible to look at,
too powerful to resist


89
0:7:45,124 --> 0:7:47,421
luring us onwards,


90
0:7:47,421 --> 0:7:52,716
on, like a moth to a flame


91
0:7:52,716 --> 0:7:56,612
Dwarfed by, scorched by the sun,


92
0:7:56,612 --> 0:7:59,809
it's Mercury


93
0:7:59,809 --> 0:8:4,504
Get too close to the sun,
this is what happens


94
0:8:4,504 --> 0:8:7,201
Temperature swing wildly here


95
0:8:7,201 --> 0:8:11,397
At night, it's -170 degrees


96
0:8:11,397 --> 0:8:15,792
come midday, it's 400+


97
0:8:15,792 --> 0:8:17,99
burnt, frozen


98
0:8:17,99 --> 0:8:20,188
and look at those scars


99
0:8:20,188 --> 0:8:25,182
a sign that Mercury
had a violent past


100
0:8:25,182 --> 0:8:30,77
The Messenger space probe,
it's telling us something strange


101
0:8:30,77 --> 0:8:34,473
For its size, this little planet
has a powerful gravitational pull


102
0:8:34,473 --> 0:8:37,67
It must be heavier than it looks


103
0:8:37,67 --> 0:8:42,664
It's like a huge ball of iron
covered with a thin veneer of rock


104
0:8:42,664 --> 0:8:48,159
The core of what was
once much larger planet


105
0:8:48,159 --> 0:8:52,454
Maybe a stray planet
slammed into Mercury


106
0:8:52,454 --> 0:9:0,246
blasting away its out layers
in a deadly game of cosmic pinball


107
0:9:0,246 --> 0:9:2,144
Whole planets on the loose


108
0:9:2,144 --> 0:9:6,64
destroying anything in their path,
even entire planets


109
0:9:6,64 --> 0:9:8,738
and we are in the middle of it:


110
0:9:8,738 --> 0:9:13,433
vulnerable, exposed, small


111
0:9:13,433 --> 0:9:17,329
everything is telling us to turn back


112
0:9:17,329 --> 0:9:20,426
but who could defy this


113
0:9:20,426 --> 0:9:26,819
the sun, in all its mesmerizing splendor


114
0:9:26,819 --> 0:9:30,515
Our light, our lives


115
0:9:30,515 --> 0:9:34,111
Everything we do
is controlled by the sun


116
0:9:34,111 --> 0:9:36,9
depends on it


117
0:9:36,9 --> 0:9:37,308
and more than that


118
0:9:37,308 --> 0:9:42,203
it's the Greek god Helios
driving his chariot across the sky


119
0:9:42,203 --> 0:9:45,899
The Egyptian god Ra, reborn everyday


120
0:9:45,899 --> 0:9:49,595
the summer solstice sun rising
at Stonehenge


121
0:9:49,595 --> 0:9:51,494
For millions of years


122
0:9:51,494 --> 0:9:58,886
this was as close as it got to
staring into the face of god


123
0:9:58,886 --> 0:10:1,983
150 million kilometers from home


124
0:10:1,983 --> 0:10:5,479
a 20-year journey by plane


125
0:10:5,479 --> 0:10:7,377
switch it off


126
0:10:7,377 --> 0:10:9,475
and it's so far away


127
0:10:9,475 --> 0:10:15,69
we wouldn't know about it
for a whole 8 minutes


128
0:10:15,69 --> 0:10:22,661
It's so big, you could fit
a million earths inside it


129
0:10:22,661 --> 0:10:33,251
So heavy, its gravity controls
the entire solar system


130
0:10:33,251 --> 0:10:35,248
But who needs numbers


131
0:10:35,248 --> 0:10:40,543
we've got the real thing


132
0:10:40,543 --> 0:10:42,641
We see it everyday


133
0:10:42,641 --> 0:10:46,437
a familiar face in our sky


134
0:10:46,437 --> 0:10:51,332
up close, it's unrecognizable


135
0:10:51,332 --> 0:10:56,327
a turbulent sea of incandescent gas


136
0:10:56,327 --> 0:11:3,12
The thermometer rises
to over 5,000 degrees


137
0:11:3,12 --> 0:11:4,718
Down in the core,


138
0:11:4,718 --> 0:11:17,705
it's got to be
tens of millions of degrees


139
0:11:17,705 --> 0:11:20,901
Hot enough to trigger a nuclear reaction


140
0:11:20,901 --> 0:11:26,995
turning millions of tons of
matter into energy, every second


141
0:11:26,995 --> 0:11:31,491
More than all the energy
ever made by mankind


142
0:11:31,491 --> 0:11:34,987
Back home,
we see this energy as light


143
0:11:34,987 --> 0:11:39,782
feel it as heat


144
0:11:39,782 --> 0:11:45,176
But up close, there is nothing
comforting about the sun


145
0:11:45,176 --> 0:11:48,573
It's so full of electrical
and magnetic activity


146
0:11:48,573 --> 0:11:56,565
It's bursting out in this
huge incandescent gas loops
called prominences


147
0:11:56,565 --> 0:12:0,96
Each one releasing more energy
than ten million volcanos


148
0:12:0,96 --> 0:12:3,358
You could get the earth
through one of these loops


149
0:12:3,358 --> 0:12:13,248
and still have tens of thousands
of kilometers to spare


150
0:12:13,248 --> 0:12:15,245
And when they burst through


151
0:12:15,245 --> 0:12:18,542
it's exposing a cooler layers below


152
0:12:18,542 --> 0:12:22,938
making sunspots


153
0:12:22,938 --> 0:12:26,134
They're a fraction cooler
than their surroundings


154
0:12:26,134 --> 0:12:27,433
it's why they look black


155
0:12:27,433 --> 0:12:30,13
but they are still hotter
than anything on earth


156
0:12:30,13 --> 0:12:32,328
and they are massive too


157
0:12:32,328 --> 0:12:38,921
Some of these are
at least 50,000km across


158
0:12:38,921 --> 0:12:41,119
a solar flare


159
0:12:41,119 --> 0:12:43,916
a superheated stream of electrified gas


160
0:12:43,916 --> 0:12:50,909
blasting deadly radiation out into space


161
0:12:50,909 --> 0:12:54,105
But one day,
all this will stop


162
0:12:54,105 --> 0:13:2,597
the sun's fuel will be spent


163
0:13:2,597 --> 0:13:10,688
When it dies, that will be it
for the earth as well


164
0:13:10,688 --> 0:13:15,84
This god creates life and destroys it


165
0:13:15,84 --> 0:13:25,973
demands we keep our distance


166
0:13:25,973 --> 0:13:29,269
This comet has strayed too close


167
0:13:29,269 --> 0:13:32,266
It's been boiled away
by the sun's heat


168
0:13:32,266 --> 0:13:47,51
creating a tail stretches
for millions of kilometers


169
0:13:47,51 --> 0:13:49,448
It's freezing in here


170
0:13:49,448 --> 0:13:52,46
There's no doubt
where these comets come from


171
0:13:52,46 --> 0:13:56,941
the icy wastes of deep space


172
0:13:56,941 --> 0:14:1,636
But look at all these steam,
the geysers and dust


173
0:14:1,636 --> 0:14:6,831
it's the sun again,
melting the comet's frozen heart


174
0:14:6,831 --> 0:16:6,831
A kind of vast dirty snowball
covered in grimy tar
