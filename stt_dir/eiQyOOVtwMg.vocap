###17 LUIS CEDENO: The fact of the matter is that Chavez has
###18 never spoken about crime and violence.
###21 To not recognize that crime and violence is the number one
###26 issue is overlooking a huge reality of what Venezuelan
###31 people are living today.
###32 Now apparently, at last, the president has said that crime
###38 is a problem--
###39 after 12, 13 years--
###41 but this time of ours, too little too late.
###45 RYAN DUFFY: With the government not addressing the
###47 crime and violence issue until very recently, local news
###50 reporters have taken it upon themselves
###52 to educate the public.
###54 Right now we're on our way to meet Davis Ramirez who's the
###56 local crime reporter for El Universal.
###59 We're going to tag along with him on
###60 his beat around Caracas.
###63 DAVIS RAMIREZ MIRANDA: [SPEAKING SPANISH]

###105 RYAN DUFFY: During our interview, Davis got a call
###107 about a body that was found in downtown Caracas bound,
###110 tortured, and decomposing.
###112 We sped off to the scene.
###113 DAVIS RAMIREZ MIRANDA: [SPEAKING SPANISH]

###154 RYAN DUFFY: In 2008, the year that crime became the number
###157 one public issue, the government stopped releasing
###159 official figures to the public.
###162 Now reporters like Davis are forced to construct these
###164 numbers on their own.

###246 RYAN DUFFY: After a day of chasing bodies, we hit another
###248 regular stop on Davis's beat, Caracas' only morgue.
###252 And the only place to get an accurate count of the victims.
###255 DAVIS RAMIREZ MIRANDA: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###256 
###263 RYAN DUFFY: So are this many journalists here every day?
###265 DAVIS RAMIREZ MIRANDA: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###267 RYAN DUFFY: Are there official government channels that are
###269 here as well, or is it all opposition coverage?
###272 DAVIS RAMIREZ MIRANDA: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###273 
###288 RYAN DUFFY: There's kind of this weird duality to this.
###290 Where on one hand it feels really uncomfortable and
###292 really predatory, and you're just standing around waiting
###296 on something terrible to happen.
###298 On the other hand, it's information service.
###300 There's no other way to find out these statistics and the
###303 actual homicide numbers because the government doesn't
###305 release them.
###306 So there really is no other way to get this information
###309 than to be here waiting for people to die.
