0:0:24,566 --> 0:0:28,486
Sitting in a big white room alone 


2
0:0:28,486 --> 0:0:39,789
Tilt my head back, feel the tears fall down 


3
0:0:39,789 --> 0:0:43,501
Close my eyes to see in the dark 


4
0:0:43,501 --> 0:0:54,721
I feel young, broken, so scared 


5
0:0:54,721 --> 0:0:58,266
I don't wanna be here anymore


6
0:0:58,266 --> 0:1:9,903
I wanna be somewhere else normal and free, like I used to be 


7
0:1:9,903 --> 0:1:14,532
But I have to stay in this big white room 


8
0:1:14,532 --> 0:1:24,959
With little old me 


9
0:1:24,959 --> 0:1:32,592
I'm going crazy, I'm losing my mind 


10
0:1:32,592 --> 0:1:40,475
I'm going crazy, in this big white room of mine 


11
0:1:40,475 --> 0:1:48,441
I'm going crazy, I'm losing my mind 


12
0:1:48,441 --> 0:2:5,41
I'm going crazy, in this big white room of mine 


13
0:2:5,41 --> 0:2:8,503
Sitting in a big white room alone


14
0:2:8,503 --> 0:2:18,596
Close the door don't want the pain to come in 


15
0:2:18,596 --> 0:2:21,766
I clench my fist and try to stay strong


16
0:2:21,766 --> 0:2:32,402
 I cry, feel sick my hearts beating b-b-b-b-beating beating out of control 


17
0:2:32,402 --> 0:2:35,53
Can I run, run faster than you


18
0:2:35,53 --> 0:2:46,166
I wanna feel my body again, feel the wind in my hair - yeah


19
0:2:46,166 --> 0:2:50,295
But I have to stay in this big white room


20
0:2:50,295 --> 0:2:59,554
Cuz' no one else cares no


21
0:2:59,554 --> 0:3:6,561
I'm going crazy, I'm losing my mind 


22
0:3:6,561 --> 0:3:13,777
I'm going crazy, in this big white room of mine 


23
0:3:13,777 --> 0:3:20,7
I'm going crazy, I'm losing my mind 


24
0:3:20,7 --> 0:3:27,165
I'm going crazy, in this big white room of mine 


25
0:3:27,165 --> 0:3:33,46
Everybody's looking at me, everybody's staring at me


26
0:3:33,46 --> 0:3:40,679
What do I do now - smile, yeah, yeah


27
0:3:40,679 --> 0:3:46,184
Everybody's looking at me, everybody's staring at me


28
0:3:46,184 --> 0:4:6,955
What do I do now - smile, yeah, yeah


29
0:4:6,955 --> 0:4:14,87
I'm going crazy, I'm losing my mind 


30
0:4:14,87 --> 0:4:21,94
I'm going crazy, in this big white room of mine 


31
0:4:21,94 --> 0:4:27,976
I'm going crazy, I'm losing my mind 


32
0:4:27,976 --> 0:4:34,733
I'm going crazy, in this big white room of mine 


33
0:4:34,733 --> 0:4:41,74
I'm going crazy, I'm losing my mind 


34
0:4:41,74 --> 0:6:41,74
I'm going crazy, in this big white room of mine
