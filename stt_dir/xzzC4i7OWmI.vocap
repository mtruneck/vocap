###13 -Come on, I see the pig's teeth.
###17 
###20 -Let me touch it.
###25 -Who killed it?
###26 EDDIE HUANG: Chef Creole.

###54 EDDIE HUANG: 'Sup, Hasai FOBs.
###56 We are here in Little Haiti, about to see the world famous
###59 Chef Creole.
###60 CHEF CREOLE: What?
###60 What?
###62 What?
###62 EDDIE HUANG: We're going to tailgate with him and his
###64 friends.
###64 -Good job, Chef.
###65 That was delicious, man.
###66 EDDIE HUANG: Then we're going to hit the
###67 water, get on a boat.
###69 Palm trees are sexy, dude.
###71 Palm trees are very sexy.
###72 And see how Haitians do in Miami.
###74 Peace, peace, y'all.
###76 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###79 EDDIE HUANG: What's up, Chef Creole?
###80 CHEF CREOLE: Hey!
###81 What's up?
###82 EDDIE HUANG: It's good.
###82 How are you doing?
###82 CHEF CREOLE: How you doing?
###83 EDDIE HUANG: Good, good, good.
###84 Thank you for having me here today, man.
###87 Really excited.
###87 CHEF CREOLE: I feel bad for you.
###89 When you're coming from New York, it's cold.
###91 EDDIE HUANG: Yeah.
###92 CHEF CREOLE: Look at you.
###93 EDDIE HUANG: Oh, you saw me.
###93 I was tanning on the street earlier.
###94 CHEF CREOLE: Yeah, I was like Eddie's out of his mind!
###97 He's up here in Miami, getting butt naked!
###100 EDDIE HUANG: A panda escaped from the zoo.
###104 I like it.
###105 CHEF CREOLE: Do you?
###106 EDDIE HUANG: Conch.
###107 CHEF CREOLE: We got conch, got shrimp, got lobster.
###110 Let's go in the kitchen and play around for a little bit.
###113 EDDIE HUANG: Let's do it.
###114 CHEF CREOLE: You know, Little Haiti's real interesting.
###115 You know it's a Creole culture.
###118 And one of the things that people need to understand is
###121 that Louisiana is Creole.
###124 EDDIE HUANG: Yes.
###124 CHEF CREOLE: The language of Haiti is Creole.
###127 EDDIE HUANG: Creole, yeah.
###127 CHEF CREOLE: The Louisiana Creole that you know about,
###130 it's the same Creole that's here from Haiti.
###133 Look at this.
###134 This is what I call big time cooking.
###136 EDDIE HUANG: Red beans and rice.
###137 CHEF CREOLE: Red beans and rice, baby.
###138 In Creole, it's called [INAUDIBLE].
###142 Look at this.
###142 EDDIE HUANG: Mango snapper.
###143 CHEF CREOLE: Look at this snapper.
###144 Hey look, this ain't just snapper that we just take, put
###148 it under hot water and give it to the people.
###150 Bull shit, man.
###152 Got to clean the damn thing.
###154 Clean it right.
###155 Then we got to cut it so all the seasonings
###158 get right up in there.
###159 See all the fish we're cooking?
###160 EDDIE HUANG: Yeah.
###161 CHEF CREOLE: I mean, we're into production, baby.
###163 This is bang, bang, bang.
###165 EDDIE HUANG: A lot of people say, Chef, when he cooks he
###167 puts his foot in it.
###168 And you know something?
###170 It's true.
###170 It's not nice to say on TV.
###172 CHEF CREOLE: No, that's the best compliment someone could
###173 tell you is you put your foot in the shit.
###176 Well, look at that bad boy.
###179 EDDIE HUANG: He's smiling.
###180 CHEF CREOLE: He's smiling.
###181 EDDIE HUANG: He's still smiling.
###182 What temperature are you going to do this at?
###184 CHEF CREOLE: This is at 250 to 275, eight hours--
###189 slow!
###190 EDDIE HUANG: There you go.
###191 CHEF CREOLE: Slow, baby!
###192 We come under here, look at that!
###194 EDDIE HUANG: Wow, get up in the guts.
###196 CHEF CREOLE: This is how we do business, baby.
###199 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###205 CHEF CREOLE: I've always learned in life, you got to
###208 build your army.
###209 OK, watch your hands now.
###210 Watch your hands.
###211 And your army is what you call your support system.
###213 EDDIE HUANG: Yeah.
###215 CHEF CREOLE: The best support system you could have is
###217 grassroots.
###219 If for some reason you're not pleased with the next level--
###223 you're like, look guys, this is a little bit too
###225 superficial for me.
###226 EDDIE HUANG: Look at you, you've got the promo!
###228 CHEF CREOLE: I got the promo.
###229 We don't play, baby.
###230 We rock and roll.
###232 At least you're not going to be shunned out.
###235 Because the first adopters, they will always keep it real.
###237 They'll always get your back.
###238 EDDIE HUANG: You nailed it on the head, man.
###239 The grassroots and your first supporters-- those are the
###242 people you do it for.
###243 That's your family.
###244 The other thing I wanted to ask you about is
###247 gentrification, right?
###248 I really want to see it happen with people like you opening
###252 Chef Creole's.
###252 Serving the community that's here.
###254 Providing an environment that other people can also enjoy.
###257 CHEF CREOLE: Right.
###258 EDDIE HUANG: But it's very, very evident from jump, when
###260 you come to Chef Creole, who that restaurant is inspired by
###265 and who you are paying tribute to, and
###268 they will never change.
###269 Because he got money.
###270 He got money.
###271 He look expensive.
###272 -See that stomach right there?
###274 That stomach is expensive.
###276 But for these prices, I tell you, I'm fed and we're good.
###279 The family is here, everyone's here.
###281 The family over here, family over here.
###284 EDDIE HUANG: And I think that's the thing with
###286 gentrification that people have to remember.
###288 It's like, who came before?
###289 What are the traditions of this neighborhood?
###291 How can we come in and integrate into this
###293 neighborhood, not come in and take it over.
###296 Do it in a way that everyone can participate, because
###298 that's what you do with your restaurant.
###300 CHEF CREOLE: Something that I would normally sell for $12, I
###303 would turn around and say look, we're in the 'hood.
###306 We're in the 'hood.
###308 I'm going to run a special, $4.99.
###311 Now we're talking business.
###313 Now you've got the people that encompasses that area, now
###318 you've got them involved.
###319 EDDIE HUANG: And you're investing.
###320 You've invested in these people.
###324 CHEF CREOLE: Let's go.
###326 -I'm excited.
###328 Chef Creole is bringing us a pig.
###330 That things about, what, 100 pounds?
###332 Can't wait.
###333 We're hungry.
###335 I've got all my friends waiting
###336 for me at the tailgate.
###338 That's where we party like rock stars.
###340 
###348 CHEF CREOLE: Yeah!
###349 Yeah!
###350 EDDIE HUANG: Very good.
###353 -Oh, that shit just looks beautiful, man.
###354 Look at that thing.
###356 It's gorgeous.
###357 Can't wait to get some onto this bread right now.
###360 EDDIE HUANG: There's some real Axe Body Spray
###362 vibrations out here.
###363 CHEF CREOLE: The game's about to start and we're going to
###365 get out of here, man.
###366 We're going to go in the water and get some
###369 real natural salt.
###369 You know what I mean?
###370 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###381 EDDIE HUANG: Ready, let's go.
###383 Everything's better on the water.
###384 CHEF CREOLE: Everything's better on the water.
###386 All the negativity that followed you jumped off a
###390 bridge away because they knew you were coming here.
###391 EDDIE HUANG: I don't know, my producer's still here.
###393 [LAUGHTER]
###396 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###409 CHEF CREOLE: That's the island over there, guys.
###411 You see it?
###412 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###421 CHEF CREOLE: OK, one, two, three, four, five, six, and we
###427 got seven on the--
###428 one, two, three, four, five.
###429 Can't lose none of the puppies in the litter, baby.
###432 
###435 EDDIE HUANG: You know, we rarely put chefs on "Fresh Off
###438 the Boat." Because I want to get into culture in ways
###443 outside of the restaurant, outside of chefs.
###446 But sometimes the best way into a story
###449 is a chef, you know?
###450 This dude grew up on these streets.
###453 He reps it hard.
###453 He reps his family.
###455 And I feel blessed just to be a part of it.
###456 To come and see how in a lot of ways they've kind of
###459 recreated their own Haiti in Miami.
###463 And that's the goal of the show is to try to go find
###466 these underdogs.
###467 Try to go find these stories that other people thought were
###470 inappropriate for food shows.
###471 This is how people live.
###473 This is how people eat.
###474 This is how culture is created,
###476 preserved, and survived.
###477 So I hope you all enjoyed it.
###479 I hope you all enjoyed Miami.
###480 And I hope overall you all enjoy the real life reality
###483 that we give you on "Fresh Off the Boat." All right?
###485 It's your boy, Eddie Huang.
###488 We out.
