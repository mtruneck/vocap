heavy metal band.

0:0:22,12 --> 0:0:24,4
They escaped Iraq,
went to Syria.

Now they live here in Turkey.

0:0:25,93 --> 0:0:27,72
These guys play fast and loud.

0:0:27,72 --> 0:0:30,18
They've obviously listened to a

practice space, right?


15
0:1:13,8 --> 0:1:14,24
MARWAN: Yeah, different
studios.


16
0:1:14,24 --> 0:1:15,93
Whatever's like available,
you know?


17
0:1:15,93 --> 0:1:18,47
We just go down there,
down like


18
0:1:18,47 --> 0:1:20,85
crossing the street, here.


19
0:1:20,85 --> 0:1:23,6
We've got like three or four
studios that we go-- and


20
0:1:23,6 --> 0:1:24,16
different every time.


21
0:1:24,16 --> 0:1:26,42

better than

the situation before.

we had of our own was back in


25
0:1:33,58 --> 0:1:34,38
Baghdad, in Iraq.


26
0:1:34,38 --> 0:1:38,77
And after the war situation got
bad, this place got bombed


27
0:1:38,77 --> 0:1:39,87
and explode.


28
0:1:39,87 --> 0:1:44,3

still shaped as a building,

but you go inside,
there's nothing.

0:1:45,63 --> 0:1:47,53

0:1:47,53 --> 0:1:51,19
So then we start on the run.


32
0:1:51,19 --> 0:1:53,39
We left to Syria.


33
0:1:53,39 --> 0:1:56,32
And Syria, also, we didn't have
practice space, because


34
0:1:56,32 --> 0:1:58,35
we couldn't like afford
to rent a studio.

have a studio that

0:2:2,84 --> 0:2:4,79
fits our kind of music.

got here to Istanbul, Turkey,


40
0:2:9,394 --> 0:2:14,26
then we find different studios
with different equipment.
