###3 THOMAS: It's the gift booth, right?
###5 Or the accessories booth?
###7 CHRISTOPHE: The leatherman booth.
###9 THOMAS: It's a working elevator
###11 here inside The Eagle.
###13 Oh, wow.
###14 
###26 Leathermen used to be the deepest, darkest mystery that
###28 the gay subculture had.
###30 The sex lives and drug intake of these tough homos made even
###33 the rowdiest, straight Hell's Angels look like pussies.
###35 They were like a gang of butt-fucking werewolves.
###38 CHRISTOPHE: Splits your balls, your left and your right.
###41 THOMAS: When AIDS came on the scene, the leathermen were
###42 right on the firing line.
###44 Today, catching one in full regalia outside the small
###46 handful of leather clubs that remain is like spotting a
###49 leprechaun.
###50 Fearing that they may soon be totally extinct, I decided to
###52 dive head first into their world.
###55 The last of the great New York leather bars is The Eagle, so
###57 I started my quest there.
###59 Luckily, I soon met the best guy I could have hoped for.
###62 Christophe Andre is a long-time leatherman.
###63 And he was the winner of last year's Mr.
###65 Eagle beauty pageant.
###66 He also sells handcuffs and dildos in an
###68 elevator at the bar.
###70 CHRISTOPHE: So that's $287.74.
###75 Do you want a bag for this?
###78 Now what happens tonight is tonight we call Code on
###83 Thursdays at The Eagle.
###84 THOMAS: OK.
###85 I think I saw that sign.
###86 CHRISTOPHE: And basically what we try to encourage here is
###89 for men to come in in leather gear, all leather gear, as
###93 much as possible.
###94 We encourage no running shoes.
###97 We encourage no dress shoes or suits, ties, dress shirts,
###102 polo shirts, and definitely no cologne.
###106 THOMAS: Why?
###107 CHRISTOPHE: Gay men do not like cologne.
###107 THOMAS: No?
###108 CHRISTOPHE: No, we like the natural smell of a man.
###110 THOMAS: Is that enforced under punishment of expulsion if you
###116 catch somebody with cologne who sneaks in?
###119 They're out.
###120 CHRISTOPHE: So the only thing that I will do for you is just
###122 give you that leatherman look, a little crease.
###125 Just kind of fold you up here a little bit.
###129 THOMAS: Nice and flabby.
###130 CHRISTOPHE: Make you look a little more relaxed.
###131 THOMAS: Nice [INAUDIBLE].
###132 
###135 CHRISTOPHE: There you go.
###136 THOMAS: The leather scene supposedly started with guys
###138 coming home from World War II who missed all the
###140 freewheeling sex and bro-ing down the army provided.
###144 As a result, a big military vibe runs
###146 through the whole scene.
###148 That baker hat they all wear was swiped from the Nazis, as
###150 was a lot of other gear, like jack boots and riding crops.
###154 On my first night in The Eagle, I saw a couple dressed
###156 completely like biker cops.
###158 CHRISTOPHE: I spoke to you guys about this before.
###161 This is the current Mr. Eagle.
###162 This is Rick Weber.
###164 So he's Mr. Eagle, the year 2007.
###167 This is Thomas from Vice magazine.
###170 THOMAS: Pleasure to meet you.
###171 RICK: Nice meeting you.
###172 CHRISTOPHE: And the camera man.
###174 This is Matthew.
###177 This is Rick Weber.
###178 [LAUGHTER]
###181 THOMAS: Since grooming is so vital, a lot a leather bars
###183 have their own house barbers.
###185 This is Jake, The Eagle's barber.
###188 The second he saw me he said, I can't wait to get rid of
###191 that little Harry Potter thing you've got going.
###194 He was hands down the scariest fag I'd never met.
###196 So I said all right.
###198 I have to hold this mic up to my mouth because it's loud as
###201 shit in here.
###203 So we're over in the barber's corner.
###206 There's some pretty heavy guy on guy on harness with guys
###212 around him action going on on a screen above the bar.
###217 I've been watching, people have got wrist
###219 and arm bands on.
###222 And I'm going to ask Christophe in a little while
###225 if this stuff about left and right arm is
###227 really adhered to.
###229 They fetishized the living shit out of the
###231 whole haircut process.
###233 They've got an actual barber's chair in one
###234 corner of the room.
###236 All the products they use are these 1950s era old man
###239 things, like pomade and talcum powder.
###242 And they keep the chair facing the dick
###243 porn to keep you hard.
###245 The whole thing's a production.
###246 Over the course of my shave, I was slapped in the head,
###249 kissed on the neck, and gingerly humped.
###251 All while Jake assured me that he was taking it easy on me.
###254 I guess this is the leather equivalent of watching the big
###256 game in a La-Z-Boy while being serviced by Hooters girls.
###260 CHRISTOPHE: Look at you!
###261 THOMAS: New person.
###262 MALE SPEAKER: My god!
###263 CHRISTOPHE: Look at you.
###264 THOMAS: I'm now getting showered with adulation for
###267 having sat through a haircut.
###268 MALE SPEAKER: It's beautiful!
###270 CHRISTOPHE: You're a new man.
###271 MALE SPEAKER: Jake is a great barber.
###273 CHRISTOPHE: Have you looked in a mirror?
###276 This new hair will get you a lot of attention.
###278 THOMAS: Oh, yeah?
###279 CHRISTOPHE: Yeah, I think so.
###281 THOMAS: Getting back to my question about the arm bands.
###284 CHRISTOPHE: You know, flagging is not done as much anymore.
###286 And it's something that you see very little
###288 of now in New York.
###289 You see, it started out, I believe, in San Francisco.
###293 But you really don't see it as much in New York.
###295 So anyone that wants to flag whatever
###297 they're in the mood for.
###298 So anything that's on the left pocket, or the arm, or the
###304 wrist indicates usually that you're a top.
###307 You're the dominant of the two.
###308 THOMAS: You're giving it.
###309 CHRISTOPHE: Right.
###310 Anyone that has it on the right means they want to
###313 receive it.
###314 Some of them are very common sense.
###316 Yellow, you kind of know what that means.
###318 It's piss.
###320 Red is fisting.
###322 The light blue here is cocksucker or cock-suckee.
###327 THOMAS: Can I ask what the other colors are?
###329 CHRISTOPHE: OK, sure.
###330 THOMAS: [INAUDIBLE].
###330 What's after light blue, if it's cocksucker?
###333 CHRISTOPHE: So we did these.
###333 So that's fisting, piss, cocksucker.
###336 There is the navy blue, which is just basic fucking.
###340 Black is S&M. Pink--
###344 what do you think pink might be?
###347 THOMAS: Dresses?
###348 I don't know, transvestites?
###350 CHRISTOPHE: No, toys.
###351 THOMAS: Toys!
###352 OK, that makes sense.
###353 CHRISTOPHE: Toys.
###355 Brown--
###355 I don't even think I want to even discuss brown.
###357 THOMAS: That's fine.
###359 
###361 CHRISTOPHE: Oh, we got a cab, yes!
###363 And a big one.
###364 Just the ones I like.
###366 THOMAS: We went home and got a couple hours of sleep.
###367 Then I had to go help Christophe move his bike for
###370 the street sweeper.
###371 So we're back in Christophe's apartment.
###374 So far the leather community doesn't seem too bad.
###376 Due to fair warning, I didn't venture into the upstairs
###380 bathrooms, where supposedly a lot of the action is.
###383 The one thing everybody bought and, like, one after the other
###388 sliding in was the amyl nitrate poppers.
###392 I think it's just, like, kind of a concentrated stimulant,
###398 or something.
###398 I thought it was supposed to relax your ass.
###401 But he was saying that most commonly use it just right
###405 before getting in the sack.
###406 Or I don't know if they have a sack.
###408 I'm really not sure what it does, actually.
###410 We'll give that a shot when the mood is right.
###415 Eager to see what that scene's all about.
###420 We're back at Code night again.
###422 I'm actually dressed to code tonight.
###424 The shirt's a little blousie.
###426 Now that we've been introduced to the scene, I think we'll
###428 just cut back and enjoy the--
###430 
###433 I don't know what it would be called, the fringe benefits?
###435 It's not even that.
###436 CHRISTOPHE: [LAUGHS].
###437 Enjoy some things.
###438 Well, this is a collar.
###440 You know, basically what a collar can
###442 stand for, many things.
###444 Someone gets collared, they're a boy, they're a slave.
###449 It really identifies with being more submissive, a
###454 bottom, maybe [INAUDIBLE] a submissive boy.
###456 These are what we call a ball stretcher.
###459 Your balls come through.
###461 THOMAS: They go through that?
###462 How much are those?
###464 CHRISTOPHE: It's a range from $12 and up.
###466 THOMAS: Can I try that one on?
###467 I guess I'd have to figure out my size, wouldn't I?
###470 CHRISTOPHE: Well, we start at one inch.
###472 THOMAS: Oh, OK.
###473 CHRISTOPHE: And they're not easy to get on.
###475 Some guys can get them on really quickly.
###477 Some guys you need to really struggle.
###479 So it's a matter of just taking this like this.
###482 And just kind of--
###484 THOMAS: Dropping them in.
###485 CHRISTOPHE: --popping them in.
###486 As soon as you've got them in, you're able just to pull out
###489 and push this up that way.
###491 
###496 I may have to help you.
###497 [INTERPOSING VOICES]
###498 THOMAS: Oh, and now I'll drop in like that?
###502 OK, and then you let go?
###504 Wow!
###505 Oh, that's funny.
###507 CHRISTOPHE: It can hurt.
###508 THOMAS: It's not bad, though.
###510 Do you want a shot of my disgusting looking balls in
###513 this thing?
###515 MATTHEW: [INAUDIBLE]
###516 new frontiers here.
###517 THOMAS: I don't know if you can show that or not.
###519 And so you just wear this around?
###521 CHRISTOPHE: You can wear this around the entire day.
###525 So let's say you're going to be--
###527 
###533 you choose your pocket.
###535 THOMAS: All right.
###536 Christophe helped me get fully geared up.
###538 And finally, I was ready to experience the leather world
###541 as a leatherman.
###542 First stop, the fabled upstairs bathroom.
###546 I'll see how it turns out.
###548 How do I get there?
###550 CHRISTOPHE: That way.
###551 
###555 THOMAS: [WHISTLES].
###556 
###558 So it's an intense scene in that bathroom.
###565 
###568 Jake had previously told me [INAUDIBLE] urinals, kind of
###572 with a wall in between them.
###574 And then once the wall stopped around here, like chest level,
###579 it was chain-linked fence.
###580 And you were standing across from people kind of pissing at
###584 the same time.
###584 What they didn't tell me is that pissing here usually may
###587 mean having some guy go down on you while another guy's
###591 getting butt-fucked right next to you.
###593 But it's pretty Roman.
###595 And it smelled genuinely unique.
###599 
###602 I couldn't begin to describe the elements I assume are
###605 going into that aroma.
###608 Shit, piss, and tile cleaner being only three of many.
###614 I decided to go up to the roof to cool off and get a
###616 little fresh air.
###618 We just came up to the roof, which is kind
###621 of the cigar lounge.
###622 And there's some dudes, like, maybe 10 yards that way.
###627 When we got up here and walked down, one of them was going
###630 down on the other.
###631 And now they're just fucking.
###632 [CHUCKLES].
###634 It's kind of empty otherwise.
###635 It's like a nice little smoker's lounge, or whatever,
###639 cigar area.
###640 And they're just totally going at it.
###644 You know, I really had a lot of fun with the leathermen.
###647 All the weird rules, the fancy clothes, the butt grabbing and
###650 close contact and camaraderie.
###653 It was like being in a secret club for tough guys.
###655 At the same time, though, it never got me hard or made me
###659 want to fuck any of the guys I was hanging out with.
###662 So I guess there's this sort of disconnect there between me
###665 and the folks who are really into it and get off on being
###669 tied up, whipped.
###671 In any case, dudes know how to party.
###675 Ah!
###675 [LAUGHS].
###676 Oh, no, no.
###676 [INAUDIBLE].
###678 CHRISTOPHE: He's a wimp!
###679 THOMAS: I've got sensitive nips.
###682 There we go.
###683
