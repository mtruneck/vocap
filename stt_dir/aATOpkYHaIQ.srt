0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:2,11
STEVE SPANGLER: So today I'm
on a quest to find out what


2
0:0:2,11 --> 0:0:5,14
floats and what sinks.


3
0:0:5,14 --> 0:0:6,32
I'm Steve Spangler.


4
0:0:6,32 --> 0:0:8,235
And I'm all about making
science fun.


5
0:0:8,235 --> 0:0:11,23
For the last 20 years, I've
been teaching ways to turn


6
0:0:11,23 --> 0:0:14,24
ordinary science experiments
into unforgettable learning


7
0:0:14,24 --> 0:0:15,28
experiences.


8
0:0:15,28 --> 0:0:17,87
I have an amazing team who will
do whatever it takes to


9
0:0:17,87 --> 0:0:20,64
affect the way people
think about science.


10
0:0:20,64 --> 0:0:22,95
And do that, I live
by one motto.


11
0:0:22,95 --> 0:0:24,6
Make it big.


12
0:0:24,6 --> 0:0:25,34
Do it right.


13
0:0:25,34 --> 0:0:26,59
Give it class.


14
0:0:26,59 --> 0:0:31,27



15
0:0:31,27 --> 0:0:33,28
So let's find out simple
things that


16
0:0:33,28 --> 0:0:35,6
will float and sink.


17
0:0:35,6 --> 0:0:37,45
Dennis, it's time to
play float or sink.


18
0:0:37,45 --> 0:0:38,7
Do you want to pick something?


19
0:0:38,7 --> 0:0:40,86



20
0:0:40,86 --> 0:0:42,81
That's perfect.


21
0:0:42,81 --> 0:0:44,9
Dust remover.


22
0:0:44,9 --> 0:0:46,515
I wonder-- rocket science--
what do you think?


23
0:0:46,515 --> 0:0:47,35
DENNIS: Floats.


24
0:0:47,35 --> 0:0:49,375
STEVE SPANGLER: Oh, you might
want to think it again.


25
0:0:49,375 --> 0:0:50,26
DENNIS: Sinks.


26
0:0:50,26 --> 0:0:52,1
STEVE SPANGLER: See, always
trust your first thing.


27
0:0:52,1 --> 0:0:54,53
See, that's why he didn't
do well in school.


28
0:0:54,53 --> 0:0:55,22
Float or sink?


29
0:0:55,22 --> 0:0:55,78
What do you think?


30
0:0:55,78 --> 0:0:57,2
MALE SPEAKER: Well, it's
going to sink.


31
0:0:57,2 --> 0:0:57,55
STEVE SPANGLER: OK, let's
check and see.


32
0:0:57,55 --> 0:0:58,28
No, you're wrong.


33
0:0:58,28 --> 0:0:58,75
It floats.


34
0:0:58,75 --> 0:1:0,98
You're fired.


35
0:1:0,98 --> 0:1:2,2
Why don't we test this?


36
0:1:2,2 --> 0:1:3,906
Your stapler, float or sink?


37
0:1:3,906 --> 0:1:4,936
DENNIS: Sink.


38
0:1:4,936 --> 0:1:5,61
Definitely sink.


39
0:1:5,61 --> 0:1:6,28
STEVE SPANGLER: Are you sure?


40
0:1:6,28 --> 0:1:6,875
You want to change?


41
0:1:6,875 --> 0:1:7,455
DENNIS: Sink.


42
0:1:7,455 --> 0:1:7,96
STEVE SPANGLER: OK.


43
0:1:7,96 --> 0:1:8,54
Here we go.


44
0:1:8,54 --> 0:1:9,565
Nope, it floats.


45
0:1:9,565 --> 0:1:10,17
DENNIS: No, it doesn't.


46
0:1:10,17 --> 0:1:11,5
STEVE SPANGLER: Oh
wait, it sinks.


47
0:1:11,5 --> 0:1:12,22
All right, so it sinks.


48
0:1:12,22 --> 0:1:13,93
All right, so you
won that one.


49
0:1:13,93 --> 0:1:14,6
FEMALE SPEAKER: Sink.


50
0:1:14,6 --> 0:1:15,66
STEVE SPANGLER: All right.


51
0:1:15,66 --> 0:1:17,84
Let's check and see
how smart she is.


52
0:1:17,84 --> 0:1:20,24
All of her pens.


53
0:1:20,24 --> 0:1:24,739
Some float and some sink.


54
0:1:24,739 --> 0:1:26,65
FEMALE SPEAKER: And some are
ruined and some are--


55
0:1:26,65 --> 0:1:27,165
STEVE SPANGLER: I'm sorry.


56
0:1:27,165 --> 0:1:28,21
FEMALE SPEAKER: Watered down.


57
0:1:28,21 --> 0:1:29,24
STEVE SPANGLER: Look.


58
0:1:29,24 --> 0:1:32,48
The amazing thing is
all the pens float.


59
0:1:32,48 --> 0:1:35,48
But the scissors sink.


60
0:1:35,48 --> 0:1:38,43
Isn't that an interesting
thing to have happen?


61
0:1:38,43 --> 0:1:39,56
All right.


62
0:1:39,56 --> 0:1:41,81
I want you to get
back to work.


63
0:1:41,81 --> 0:1:45,46
Enjoy your day working at
Steve Spangler Science.


64
0:1:45,46 --> 0:1:46,6
FEMALE SPEAKER: I love my job.


65
0:1:46,6 --> 0:1:48,85
STEVE SPANGLER:And
this is great.


66
0:1:48,85 --> 0:1:49,36
There you go.


67
0:1:49,36 --> 0:1:50,65
FEMALE SPEAKER: You
know what--


68
0:1:50,65 --> 0:1:51,31
STEVE SPANGLER: There you go.


69
0:1:51,31 --> 0:1:53,6
Hey, let's see how iPhone
float or sink.


70
0:1:53,6 --> 0:1:56,96



71
0:1:56,96 --> 0:1:59,89
STEVE SPANGLER: Renee, what
would float or sink?


72
0:1:59,89 --> 0:2:1,95
Let's see her hand.


73
0:2:1,95 --> 0:2:2,76
It sinks.


74
0:2:2,76 --> 0:2:5,53
Notice how it sinks very low.


75
0:2:5,53 --> 0:2:6,58
MALE SPEAKER: Get a
piece of her car.


76
0:2:6,58 --> 0:2:8,332
STEVE SPANGLER: Yes.


77
0:2:8,332 --> 0:2:10,546
MALE SPEAKER: Pull off
a piece of her car.


78
0:2:10,546 --> 0:2:12,3
STEVE SPANGLER: OK,
there you go.


79
0:2:12,3 --> 0:2:12,486
Hey!


80
0:2:12,486 --> 0:2:13,854
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'm
just kidding.


81
0:2:13,854 --> 0:2:15,625
STEVE SPANGLER: I got
to get out of here.


82
0:2:15,625 --> 0:2:18,67



83
0:2:18,67 --> 0:2:20,252
Oh, that's perfect!


84
0:2:20,252 --> 0:2:21,94
Here, can I have that?


85
0:2:21,94 --> 0:2:23,24
Thanks, Higginsworth.


86
0:2:23,24 --> 0:2:24,695
This is going to be perfect.


87
0:2:24,695 --> 0:2:27,59



88
0:2:27,59 --> 0:2:31,9
This is perfect Diet Coke ready
in our tank of floating


89
0:2:31,9 --> 0:2:34,92
and sinking wonders and
mysteries of the universe.


90
0:2:34,92 --> 0:2:37,112
Float or sink?


91
0:2:37,112 --> 0:2:37,825
Let's see.


92
0:2:37,825 --> 0:2:40,78
Here we go.


93
0:2:40,78 --> 0:2:41,22
Yes.


94
0:2:41,22 --> 0:2:42,34
It's a floater.


95
0:2:42,34 --> 0:2:45,5
If you're a science person, you
can't just sit there and


96
0:2:45,5 --> 0:2:47,54
say, well, it just floats
and I don't know why.


97
0:2:47,54 --> 0:2:51,799
So I took all my lunch money,
and now I'm going to test all


98
0:2:51,799 --> 0:2:53,469
of these cans.


99
0:2:53,469 --> 0:2:54,423
There we go.


100
0:2:54,423 --> 0:2:56,808
Ready?


101
0:2:56,808 --> 0:2:58,12
That's a sinker.


102
0:2:58,12 --> 0:2:58,96
All right.


103
0:2:58,96 --> 0:3:1,59
And a floater goes over here.


104
0:3:1,59 --> 0:3:2,84
Here we go.


105
0:3:2,84 --> 0:3:4,93



106
0:3:4,93 --> 0:3:5,93
Two sinkers.


107
0:3:5,93 --> 0:3:6,4
Got it?


108
0:3:6,4 --> 0:3:8,63
All right, here we go.


109
0:3:8,63 --> 0:3:10,6
And here we go.


110
0:3:10,6 --> 0:3:11,616
And this one is a--


111
0:3:11,616 --> 0:3:13,74
look at this.


112
0:3:13,74 --> 0:3:15,18
All right, here we go.


113
0:3:15,18 --> 0:3:16,2
Sink and sink.


114
0:3:16,2 --> 0:3:17,31
All right, so this is it.


115
0:3:17,31 --> 0:3:19,99
These are the sinkers
right here.


116
0:3:19,99 --> 0:3:22,735
These are the floaters
over here.


117
0:3:22,735 --> 0:3:26,0
It's our job to figure out the
difference between the sinkers


118
0:3:26,0 --> 0:3:27,6
and the floaters.


119
0:3:27,6 --> 0:3:29,5
I know exactly what
you're thinking.


120
0:3:29,5 --> 0:3:31,22
The scientific way would be to
first of all look at the


121
0:3:31,22 --> 0:3:33,77
volume of each can, because
we'll need to see if the


122
0:3:33,77 --> 0:3:35,13
amount in each can
is the same.


123
0:3:35,13 --> 0:3:38,26
That means we need to take a
look at the amount right here.


124
0:3:38,26 --> 0:3:39,51
Let's line them up.


125
0:3:39,51 --> 0:3:43,86



126
0:3:43,86 --> 0:3:45,2
Take a look at this.


127
0:3:45,2 --> 0:3:48,205
355, 355, 355.


128
0:3:48,205 --> 0:3:51,19
If you're metrically challenged,
that's 12 ounces.


129
0:3:51,19 --> 0:3:51,99
Stick with metrics.


130
0:3:51,99 --> 0:3:52,72
355.


131
0:3:52,72 --> 0:3:56,49
Now let's take a look at
the ones that floated.


132
0:3:56,49 --> 0:3:57,74
There's one.


133
0:3:57,74 --> 0:3:59,37
There's one.


134
0:3:59,37 --> 0:4:1,9
Here's one.


135
0:4:1,9 --> 0:4:3,13
And here's this guy here.


136
0:4:3,13 --> 0:4:5,47
It's the same, 355.


137
0:4:5,47 --> 0:4:6,99
Each one of these has
the same amount of


138
0:4:6,99 --> 0:4:8,48
liquid that's inside.


139
0:4:8,48 --> 0:4:11,23
And we can only speculate that
the volume of the can is


140
0:4:11,23 --> 0:4:13,24
exactly the same, because look,
they're identical all


141
0:4:13,24 --> 0:4:15,14
the way across.


142
0:4:15,14 --> 0:4:17,91
It must be what's inside the
can that makes all the


143
0:4:17,91 --> 0:4:19,64
difference.


144
0:4:19,64 --> 0:4:20,98
Time to look at the label.


145
0:4:20,98 --> 0:4:23,71
Let's move this out of the way
and analyze cans from each of


146
0:4:23,71 --> 0:4:25,7
the two groups.


147
0:4:25,7 --> 0:4:27,836
Float goes over here.


148
0:4:27,836 --> 0:4:30,8
The sink goes over here.


149
0:4:30,8 --> 0:4:31,98
And these--


150
0:4:31,98 --> 0:4:33,78
Here's something that Americans
haven't read in a


151
0:4:33,78 --> 0:4:36,32
long time, judging
from waistline.


152
0:4:36,32 --> 0:4:40,37
140 calories in this one,
0 calories in this one.


153
0:4:40,37 --> 0:4:43,1
But that doesn't really mean
anything until you go down a


154
0:4:43,1 --> 0:4:44,69
little bit further.


155
0:4:44,69 --> 0:4:47,3
The only noticeable difference,
in the one that


156
0:4:47,3 --> 0:4:51,6
sinks, it's 39 grams
of carbohydrates.


157
0:4:51,6 --> 0:4:54,39
The noticeable difference, the
one that floats, 0 grams of


158
0:4:54,39 --> 0:4:55,16
carbohydrates.


159
0:4:55,16 --> 0:4:56,77
But what does that
really mean?


160
0:4:56,77 --> 0:5:2,81
Carbohydrates mean sugar,
a lot of sugar.


161
0:5:2,81 --> 0:5:7,19
And the average American
consumes nearly 50 gallons of


162
0:5:7,19 --> 0:5:10,43
this sugar-packed soda
every single year.


163
0:5:10,43 --> 0:5:12,8
That's a lot of sugar.


164
0:5:12,8 --> 0:5:14,53
And if you think about it,
there should be a weight


165
0:5:14,53 --> 0:5:17,64
difference between the cans
because if density equals mass


166
0:5:17,64 --> 0:5:20,91
divided by volume, and the
volume is the same on both of


167
0:5:20,91 --> 0:5:23,61
them, it means the amount of
stuff in each of those cans


168
0:5:23,61 --> 0:5:24,65
must be different.


169
0:5:24,65 --> 0:5:25,8
It's time to weigh it.


170
0:5:25,8 --> 0:5:28,1
All right, take a
look at this.


171
0:5:28,1 --> 0:5:32,21
389 grams for the
one that sinks.


172
0:5:32,21 --> 0:5:36,41
And the diet, 370 grams.


173
0:5:36,41 --> 0:5:38,485
That's nearly 20 grams.


174
0:5:38,485 --> 0:5:40,11
And it's all sugar.


175
0:5:40,11 --> 0:5:43,42
But what does that
really look like?


176
0:5:43,42 --> 0:5:45,83
A packet of sugar, that's
easy enough.


177
0:5:45,83 --> 0:5:50,9
How many packets of sugar are
in that can of regular soda?


178
0:5:50,9 --> 0:5:51,69
Well, of course, there's
more than one.


179
0:5:51,69 --> 0:5:53,19
How about this 1, 2.


180
0:5:53,19 --> 0:5:55,36
Keep going, 3.


181
0:5:55,36 --> 0:5:56,73
And I got a bunch of them.


182
0:5:56,73 --> 0:5:57,73
Just stop me when we're ready.


183
0:5:57,73 --> 0:6:1,21
4, 5, 6-- no, keep going--


184
0:6:1,21 --> 0:6:4,647
7, 8, 9, 10-- no, keep going--


185
0:6:4,647 --> 0:6:11,97
11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17,
18 packets of sugar.


186
0:6:11,97 --> 0:6:14,72
Nutritionists say the equivalent
of sugar in that


187
0:6:14,72 --> 0:6:18,64
can of soda is nearly
18 packets of sugar.


188
0:6:18,64 --> 0:6:21,37
Now, let's say you go home and
on your way home, you're


189
0:6:21,37 --> 0:6:24,45
thirsty, so you go get one of
those bladder busting cups


190
0:6:24,45 --> 0:6:25,9
that's 60 ounces.


191
0:6:25,9 --> 0:6:29,64
That's nearly 100
packs of sugar.


192
0:6:29,64 --> 0:6:32,12
So let's say that you just
wanted one of these a day.


193
0:6:32,12 --> 0:6:34,3
365 days, what could
that do to you?


194
0:6:34,3 --> 0:6:40,64
Well, after 365 days, you've
eaten the equivalent of 3,650


195
0:6:40,64 --> 0:6:41,71
teaspoons of sugar.


196
0:6:41,71 --> 0:6:46,5
That's 32 pounds, or 14.5
kilograms of sugar.


197
0:6:46,5 --> 0:6:48,8
All this talk of sugar
is making me hungry.


198
0:6:48,8 --> 0:6:51,96
And who doesn't like
a gummy bear?


199
0:6:51,96 --> 0:6:53,37
You ever heard of a kid being
all hyped up on sugar?


200
0:6:53,37 --> 0:6:56,6
Well, my question is so how
much energy is in just one


201
0:6:56,6 --> 0:6:57,62
tiny little gummy bear?


202
0:6:57,62 --> 0:6:59,67
Let's go figure it out.


203
0:6:59,67 --> 0:7:1,43
Well, this is where we
need safety glasses.


204
0:7:1,43 --> 0:7:4,32
And we're also going to need
a strong oxidizer.


205
0:7:4,32 --> 0:7:6,18
This is where we're using
this oxidizer here


206
0:7:6,18 --> 0:7:8,2
called potassium chlorate.


207
0:7:8,2 --> 0:7:9,96
And this is the part where I
have to tell you don't try


208
0:7:9,96 --> 0:7:11,27
this at home.


209
0:7:11,27 --> 0:7:12,8
Try it at a chemistry
teacher's home.


210
0:7:12,8 --> 0:7:14,13
Wait until you get to college.


211
0:7:14,13 --> 0:7:14,86
I don't care.


212
0:7:14,86 --> 0:7:16,85
Just don't try it at home.


213
0:7:16,85 --> 0:7:22,21
Potassium chlorate has oxygen
molecules that we can liberate


214
0:7:22,21 --> 0:7:26,84
fairly easily with some heat
and an organic material.


215
0:7:26,84 --> 0:7:30,24
And potassium chlorate has a
fairly high melting point.


216
0:7:30,24 --> 0:7:31,72
That's why we're going to
need to use some fire.


217
0:7:31,72 --> 0:7:36,61



218
0:7:36,61 --> 0:7:39,35
You can see that it's
finally melting.


219
0:7:39,35 --> 0:7:43,13
And it's just about ready
for some gummy bears.


220
0:7:43,13 --> 0:7:45,93
So let's see how much energy
we can release by simply


221
0:7:45,93 --> 0:7:48,18
dropping three of
the gummy bears


222
0:7:48,18 --> 0:7:49,91
into our strong oxidizer.


223
0:7:49,91 --> 0:7:51,16
Watch.


224
0:7:51,16 --> 0:7:56,22



225
0:7:56,22 --> 0:7:58,97
There's a tremendous amount of
energy being release in just


226
0:7:58,97 --> 0:8:0,8
three gummy bears.


227
0:8:0,8 --> 0:8:2,97
The strong oxidizer touches
the organic,


228
0:8:2,97 --> 0:8:3,97
which is the sugar.


229
0:8:3,97 --> 0:8:7,66
In fact, we're just figuring out
how much energy is trapped


230
0:8:7,66 --> 0:8:10,6
in three gummy bears.


231
0:8:10,6 --> 0:8:14,5
What remains from this smoky
mess is just a small amount of


232
0:8:14,5 --> 0:8:18,19
carbon that's at the bottom
of the beaker.


233
0:8:18,19 --> 0:8:20,46
Well, the producers at the Ellen
DeGeneres Show liked


234
0:8:20,46 --> 0:8:21,13
that experiment.


235
0:8:21,13 --> 0:8:23,375
But they wanted to know what
would happen if we took it to


236
0:8:23,375 --> 0:8:24,47
an extreme level.


237
0:8:24,47 --> 0:8:26,58
And I'd never seen anybody
do it in a


238
0:8:26,58 --> 0:8:29,15
five liter flask before.


239
0:8:29,15 --> 0:8:31,34
The question was just how much
smoke would it produce.


240
0:8:31,34 --> 0:8:32,64
They weren't worried
about that.


241
0:8:32,64 --> 0:8:34,97
And trust me, there was
a tremendous number of


242
0:8:34,97 --> 0:8:37,429
firefighters that
were on the set.


243
0:8:37,429 --> 0:8:38,51
Take a look.


244
0:8:38,51 --> 0:8:41,15
Have you ever heard somebody
talk about a sugar high?


245
0:8:41,15 --> 0:8:42,84
They say kids have
a sugar high?


246
0:8:42,84 --> 0:8:44,175
So I have gummy bears.


247
0:8:44,175 --> 0:8:45,75
So these are little
gummy bears.


248
0:8:45,75 --> 0:8:47,59
And they're packed
with energy.


249
0:8:47,59 --> 0:8:50,91
So when you get them to a kid,
of course, they're crazy.


250
0:8:50,91 --> 0:8:53,92
So here's what I have here
is I have this liquid.


251
0:8:53,92 --> 0:8:56,175
It's not just gummy bears you
feed to a kid that is crazy.


252
0:8:56,175 --> 0:8:57,84
It's just candy in general.


253
0:8:57,84 --> 0:8:59,81
I have a liquid here that's
full of oxygen.


254
0:8:59,81 --> 0:9:1,68
And it's a great oxidizer.


255
0:9:1,68 --> 0:9:3,3
So what I'm going to do is take
some of the gummy bears


256
0:9:3,3 --> 0:9:4,61
and I'm going to drop
them down inside.


257
0:9:4,61 --> 0:9:6,68
And I'm going to show you how to
release the energy from the


258
0:9:6,68 --> 0:9:7,672
gummy bears.


259
0:9:7,672 --> 0:9:8,95
ELLEN DEGENERES: What's
the liquid in there?


260
0:9:8,95 --> 0:9:10,52
STEVE SPANGLER: It's
an oxidizer.


261
0:9:10,52 --> 0:9:11,75
It's called potassium
chlorate.


262
0:9:11,75 --> 0:9:12,92
It's an oxidizer.


263
0:9:12,92 --> 0:9:14,415
So you stand back just
a little bit.


264
0:9:14,415 --> 0:9:15,46
You're perfect right there.


265
0:9:15,46 --> 0:9:16,6
OK, ready?


266
0:9:16,6 --> 0:9:17,135
So I'm going to drop them
in here like this.


267
0:9:17,135 --> 0:9:18,175
So watch this.


268
0:9:18,175 --> 0:9:18,945
Oh, beautiful.


269
0:9:18,945 --> 0:9:20,79
Look at the energy
that comes out.


270
0:9:20,79 --> 0:9:21,56
Isn't that amazing?


271
0:9:21,56 --> 0:9:22,17
ELLEN DEGENERES:
That's amazing.


272
0:9:22,17 --> 0:9:22,885
STEVE SPANGLER: That glow.


273
0:9:22,885 --> 0:9:23,435
ELLEN DEGENERES: Wow.


274
0:9:23,435 --> 0:9:24,455
STEVE SPANGLER: Wow.


275
0:9:24,455 --> 0:9:27,78
It never does that at home.


276
0:9:27,78 --> 0:9:28,9
ELLEN DEGENERES:
And the noise!


277
0:9:28,9 --> 0:9:29,606
STEVE SPANGLER: Do you
hear it howling?


278
0:9:29,606 --> 0:9:31,79
So we call it screaming
gummy bears.


279
0:9:31,79 --> 0:9:35,4
And the fumes are only slightly
toxic, which is nice.


280
0:9:35,4 --> 0:9:36,204
ELLEN DEGENERES: Oh,
that's nice.


281
0:9:36,204 --> 0:9:37,596
So I'm glad I'm not wearing--


282
0:9:37,596 --> 0:9:38,27
STEVE SPANGLER: No, it's fine.


283
0:9:38,27 --> 0:9:39,682
And the nice thing about
this is that it


284
0:9:39,682 --> 0:9:40,96
smells like a campfire.


285
0:9:40,96 --> 0:9:43,33
Well, in order to make candy,
believe it or not, you need to


286
0:9:43,33 --> 0:9:45,94
know something about the
chemistry of sucrose.


287
0:9:45,94 --> 0:9:47,75
And this is a simple
sucrose molecule.


288
0:9:47,75 --> 0:9:48,1
Take a look.


289
0:9:48,1 --> 0:9:49,82
The black here represents
carbon.


290
0:9:49,82 --> 0:9:50,82
There are 12 of the carbons.


291
0:9:50,82 --> 0:9:53,75
There are 22 hydrogens, which
are the white ones.


292
0:9:53,75 --> 0:9:57,27
And there are 11 oxygens
that you see here.


293
0:9:57,27 --> 0:9:59,365
And the difference between
somebody who really knows how


294
0:9:59,365 --> 0:10:1,43
to make candy and somebody like
me who's just cooking


295
0:10:1,43 --> 0:10:5,36
sugar is that the chef knows how
long to cook that sugar so


296
0:10:5,36 --> 0:10:8,72
that they can literally just
make the water molecules start


297
0:10:8,72 --> 0:10:9,95
to evaporate.


298
0:10:9,95 --> 0:10:12,88
While we're not going to cook
that molecule, there is a way,


299
0:10:12,88 --> 0:10:15,35
using some chemistry, that we
can make all those water


300
0:10:15,35 --> 0:10:18,19
molecules come right off.


301
0:10:18,19 --> 0:10:20,18
For this demonstration, we're
going to need to have some


302
0:10:20,18 --> 0:10:24,43
gloves and some powdered
sugar.


303
0:10:24,43 --> 0:10:26,94
Into the beaker it goes.


304
0:10:26,94 --> 0:10:29,86
And that's the perfect amount.


305
0:10:29,86 --> 0:10:33,23
And the reason for the safety
glasses and the gloves, this


306
0:10:33,23 --> 0:10:35,35
bad stuff right here,
sulfuric acid.


307
0:10:35,35 --> 0:10:36,82
If you read the label,
you would think that


308
0:10:36,82 --> 0:10:38,0
sulfuric acid is strong.


309
0:10:38,0 --> 0:10:40,6
Is says 18 molar, which
indicates the


310
0:10:40,6 --> 0:10:41,43
strength of the acid.


311
0:10:41,43 --> 0:10:44,0
However, chemically speaking,
it's a fairly weak acid.


312
0:10:44,0 --> 0:10:46,62
The real danger around sulfuric
acid, believe it or


313
0:10:46,62 --> 0:10:48,75
not, is when it gets in
contact with water.


314
0:10:48,75 --> 0:10:50,87
And since we know that there's
water there in sugar, it


315
0:10:50,87 --> 0:10:53,2
should be an easy way for
us to pull it out.


316
0:10:53,2 --> 0:10:54,8
So here's what happens.


317
0:10:54,8 --> 0:10:55,87
We take the sulfuric
acid and pour the


318
0:10:55,87 --> 0:10:57,66
sulfuric acid into here.


319
0:10:57,66 --> 0:10:59,25
And now we mix it around.


320
0:10:59,25 --> 0:11:1,62
Watch what happens as it
starts to turn black.


321
0:11:1,62 --> 0:11:4,51
We mix it around like this and
really get it mixed up.


322
0:11:4,51 --> 0:11:7,59
It starts to become very, very,
very hot as we mix it.


323
0:11:7,59 --> 0:11:9,93
And now watch what happens
when it takes off.


324
0:11:9,93 --> 0:11:14,3



325
0:11:14,3 --> 0:11:16,97
What you see coming off is all
of that water vapor, some


326
0:11:16,97 --> 0:11:21,2
fumes, and of course we have
the black carbon remaining


327
0:11:21,2 --> 0:11:23,176
from that simple
sugar molecule.


328
0:11:23,176 --> 0:11:24,88
Higginsworth, you're
a good friend.


329
0:11:24,88 --> 0:11:26,545
Thanks for letting me
have your soda.


330
0:11:26,545 --> 0:11:28,74
You take that and buy
whatever you want.


331
0:11:28,74 --> 0:11:29,62
HIGGINSWORTH: Thanks, Steve.


332
0:11:29,62 --> 0:11:31,252
STEVE SPANGLER: You're
a good guy.


333
0:11:31,252 --> 0:11:34,14
Little does Higginsworth know
that his body is going to


334
0:11:34,14 --> 0:11:36,1
change with all that sugar.


335
0:11:36,1 --> 0:11:38,54
It's going to transform
into something


336
0:11:38,54 --> 0:11:39,942
that looks like this.


337
0:11:39,942 --> 0:11:44,91



338
0:11:44,91 --> 0:11:46,9
