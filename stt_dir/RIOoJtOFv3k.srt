1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:18,19



2
0:0:18,19 --> 0:0:22,54
GREG HUNT: Well, I mean,
Dylan's like so good.


3
0:0:22,54 --> 0:0:25,52
He can pretty much do what
he wants, when he wants.


4
0:0:25,52 --> 0:0:28,46



5
0:0:28,46 --> 0:0:30,55
I don't know, how in depth
you want going to get.


6
0:0:30,55 --> 0:0:34,71
I guess I could say that the
first year of Dylan was like


7
0:0:34,71 --> 0:0:35,73
really incredible.


8
0:0:35,73 --> 0:0:38,32
It's like when he got
the Year's Best Am


9
0:0:38,32 --> 0:0:39,18
in skateboard MAG.


10
0:0:39,18 --> 0:0:43,27
And every time we'd go out he
would get something amazing.


11
0:0:43,27 --> 0:0:47,11
And then the second year,
he kind of wasn't


12
0:0:47,11 --> 0:0:49,49
really as on it.


13
0:0:49,49 --> 0:0:51,63
He was just kind of like,
whatever man.


14
0:0:51,63 --> 0:0:53,58
He was just being a kid.


15
0:0:53,58 --> 0:0:58,4
He was partying, or whatever,
but he wasn't as focused, I


16
0:0:58,4 --> 0:0:59,62
think, as he should have been.


17
0:0:59,62 --> 0:1:1,7
HEATH KIRCHART: We had
like an Alien house.


18
0:1:1,7 --> 0:1:1,73
It was me and Greg.


19
0:1:1,73 --> 0:1:6,0
And it was just basically like,
to kind of like, get


20
0:1:6,0 --> 0:1:8,24
people motivated to go film
together and everything.


21
0:1:8,24 --> 0:1:12,36
And that's when Dylan got on,
and he was in [INAUDIBLE]


22
0:1:12,36 --> 0:1:13,77
Beach, kind of not doing much.


23
0:1:13,77 --> 0:1:15,53
So Greg was like, let's
get him up here,


24
0:1:15,53 --> 0:1:16,41
get him in the house.


25
0:1:16,41 --> 0:1:17,7
We can go skate all time.


26
0:1:17,7 --> 0:1:19,6
It'll be like good
for the video.


27
0:1:19,6 --> 0:1:22,1
We'll get him out, maybe
motivate you to go skate and


28
0:1:22,1 --> 0:1:25,65
stuff like that, kind
of push each other.


29
0:1:25,65 --> 0:1:27,49
I guess it didn't really
work out that way.


30
0:1:27,49 --> 0:1:30,98
DYLAN RIEDER: Yeah, it was
a weird, weird scene.


31
0:1:30,98 --> 0:1:32,87
Like I lived in the
living room.


32
0:1:32,87 --> 0:1:36,96
All my shit's spread out,
fucking like, stay up till


33
0:1:36,96 --> 0:1:38,59
4:00 in the morning,
sleep all day.


34
0:1:38,59 --> 0:1:41,7
HEATH KIRCHART: Just clothes
everywhere, play guitar at


35
0:1:41,7 --> 0:1:42,61
fucking 3:00 in the morning.


36
0:1:42,61 --> 0:1:44,61
Learning how to play guitar,
not even playing, just


37
0:1:44,61 --> 0:1:46,15
learning how to play it.


38
0:1:46,15 --> 0:1:49,76
He would sleep til like 2, 3
o'clock in afternoon, in the


39
0:1:49,76 --> 0:1:52,91
living room, with just like
people walking over him and


40
0:1:52,91 --> 0:1:53,986
stuff like that.


41
0:1:53,986 --> 0:1:56,25
And then, just like, hey, we're
going filming in an


42
0:1:56,25 --> 0:1:57,46
hour, like get up.


43
0:1:57,46 --> 0:2:1,83
And then just like,
no, he just slept.


44
0:2:1,83 --> 0:2:4,76
Having to walk over an
18-year-old kid, in your


45
0:2:4,76 --> 0:2:7,79
living room, to go skate, and
wondering why he's not up,


46
0:2:7,79 --> 0:2:10,21
like out there as
much as I am.


47
0:2:10,21 --> 0:2:11,41
It just was discouraging.


48
0:2:11,41 --> 0:2:14,87
And, I've just never seen
someone so unmotivated.


49
0:2:14,87 --> 0:2:18,5
DYLAN RIEDER: I definitely
kind of faded away, for a


50
0:2:18,5 --> 0:2:19,23
little bit.


51
0:2:19,23 --> 0:2:23,0
Kind of got lost in my own head,
maybe some other things.


52
0:2:23,0 --> 0:2:27,45
MARK OBLOW: The Alien thing was
a starting off of a whole


53
0:2:27,45 --> 0:2:28,85
other side of Dylan.


54
0:2:28,85 --> 0:2:33,7
It was when he really started
to get addicted to drugs.


55
0:2:33,7 --> 0:2:37,515
Like, his skating, in my
opinion, was like falling.


56
0:2:37,515 --> 0:2:39,73
JASON DILL: Dylan conked
out for a while.


57
0:2:39,73 --> 0:2:41,605
He was his own Bad News Bear.


58
0:2:41,605 --> 0:2:46,428
He was fucked up all the time.


59
0:2:46,428 --> 0:2:49,886
He was just doped up.


60
0:2:49,886 --> 0:2:51,87
He was so stupid.


61
0:2:51,87 --> 0:2:53,37
He was stupid.


62
0:2:53,37 --> 0:2:55,58
You couldn't talk to him.


63
0:2:55,58 --> 0:2:57,593
And I thought I was fucked up.


64
0:2:57,593 --> 0:3:1,623
Man, he passed me right
by, but he never


65
0:3:1,623 --> 0:3:2,56
had a drinking problem.


66
0:3:2,56 --> 0:3:5,48
MARK OBLOW: I mean, I really
was having a hard time with


67
0:3:5,48 --> 0:3:6,58
the whole thing.


68
0:3:6,58 --> 0:3:8,69
I've been with the kid
since he's 11.


69
0:3:8,69 --> 0:3:11,6
Like, he's like a son, like a
brother, like a friend, all


70
0:3:11,6 --> 0:3:13,14
these things to me.


71
0:3:13,14 --> 0:3:16,23
And I'd go on trips with him
and he'd be the kid before


72
0:3:16,23 --> 0:3:19,91
that was like getting all the
tricks, boom, boom you'd be


73
0:3:19,91 --> 0:3:21,9
like, all right, you don't
need anything of Dylan.


74
0:3:21,9 --> 0:3:24,39
And he'd come on trips, and
he wouldn't get anything.


75
0:3:24,39 --> 0:3:28,85
It was literally the last year
when everyone was expecting


76
0:3:28,85 --> 0:3:35,35
like all his fucking gnarliest
shit, and that's when the year


77
0:3:35,35 --> 0:3:38,9
that it really all took a hold
of him and he just fucking


78
0:3:38,9 --> 0:3:41,38
started to just melt.


79
0:3:41,38 --> 0:3:45,72
He started having a hard time
when he was in public, like


80
0:3:45,72 --> 0:3:46,62
skating and stuff.


81
0:3:46,62 --> 0:3:48,56
Because he constantly
was feeling like


82
0:3:48,56 --> 0:3:49,55
he was being judged.


83
0:3:49,55 --> 0:3:52,22
And there was a point when he
came to me and was like, I


84
0:3:52,22 --> 0:3:52,81
want to quit.


85
0:3:52,81 --> 0:3:55,7
I don't want to, I can't
handle it anymore.


86
0:3:55,7 --> 0:3:58,83
It's too much.


87
0:3:58,83 --> 0:3:59,75
It was just fuck it.


88
0:3:59,75 --> 0:4:2,0
It all had kind of hit
into him at once.


89
0:4:2,0 --> 0:4:10,146
And then, that was his outlet
was, pop some pills.


90
0:4:10,146 --> 0:4:11,94
INTERVIEWER: What kind
of drugs, like


91
0:4:11,94 --> 0:4:14,97
they were saying pills?


92
0:4:14,97 --> 0:4:16,47
It's up to you, whatever
you want to do.


93
0:4:16,47 --> 0:4:17,459
DYLAN RIEDER: No, no
it's all good.


94
0:4:17,459 --> 0:4:19,79
I mean fucking pharmaceuticals,
man they kind


95
0:4:19,79 --> 0:4:21,98
of fucking solve your problems
for the time being.


96
0:4:21,98 --> 0:4:27,35



97
0:4:27,35 --> 0:4:29,71
Drugs will win in
the long run.


98
0:4:29,71 --> 0:4:31,668
I didn't even know what was
going on by the time of the


99
0:4:31,668 --> 0:4:32,91
end of video.


100
0:4:32,91 --> 0:4:35,66
I was pretty far gone.


101
0:4:35,66 --> 0:4:38,79
I didn't really care.


102
0:4:38,79 --> 0:4:46,17
I mean I did, but at the same
time I was trying to fucking


103
0:4:46,17 --> 0:4:48,58
not think pretty much
about anything.


104
0:4:48,58 --> 0:4:51,27
MARK OBLOW: He was that talented
that he could pull


105
0:4:51,27 --> 0:4:56,9
off something like that
without being at 100%.


106
0:4:56,9 --> 0:5:2,5
But the people that knew his
100% knew that that video was


107
0:5:2,5 --> 0:5:4,37
not even close.


108
0:5:4,37 --> 0:5:6,45
GREG HUNT: And especially
towards like the last few


109
0:5:6,45 --> 0:5:8,64
months of filming, like the
real critical time, he was


110
0:5:8,64 --> 0:5:10,58
just kind of like not
really there.


111
0:5:10,58 --> 0:5:13,2
There's always kind of like an
idea of like, hey you know


112
0:5:13,2 --> 0:5:15,69
it'd be good to get like a
couple more lines, or like


113
0:5:15,69 --> 0:5:17,87
some tranny stuff would
be really cool.


114
0:5:17,87 --> 0:5:19,67
Especially if you're someone
young like him and you already


115
0:5:19,67 --> 0:5:21,3
have a good foundation
of a [INAUDIBLE]


116
0:5:21,3 --> 0:5:26,35
you can kind of like mold
it a little bit.


117
0:5:26,35 --> 0:5:29,75
And he just wasn't really
super focused at all.


118
0:5:29,75 --> 0:5:31,67
So, I don't know, it was kind of
rough on me, because I had


119
0:5:31,67 --> 0:5:33,82
really, like, high
expectations.


120
0:5:33,82 --> 0:5:40,12
And I'm not saying his part
isn't good, but he'll admit


121
0:5:40,12 --> 0:5:43,9
this first, he had high
expectations too.


122
0:5:43,9 --> 0:5:46,51
And he knew, and in a lot of
ways, I think he feels like,


123
0:5:46,51 --> 0:5:49,12
not that he blew it, but he
could come through a lot


124
0:5:49,12 --> 0:5:49,97
better than he did.


125
0:5:49,97 --> 0:5:51,85
HEATH KIRCHART: I feel like his
part in the Alien video


126
0:5:51,85 --> 0:5:54,64
was good, but like, this is like
a kid that's like a real


127
0:5:54,64 --> 0:5:55,79
talent at skating.


128
0:5:55,79 --> 0:5:57,92
And I don't think he lived
up to this talent


129
0:5:57,92 --> 0:5:59,62
in that video part.


130
0:5:59,62 --> 0:6:1,56
There were certain people
pouring as much as they could


131
0:6:1,56 --> 0:6:4,67
into this video, and then here
there was this young kid that


132
0:6:4,67 --> 0:6:7,4
we got to be in the
video, to help the


133
0:6:7,4 --> 0:6:9,46
video, just piling out.


134
0:6:9,46 --> 0:6:13,9
I didn't know this, but at the
premier, after his part he got


135
0:6:13,9 --> 0:6:17,1
up and just left, just walked
out on the video.


136
0:6:17,1 --> 0:6:20,0
Hearing that, I mean there was
just numerous things, like, I


137
0:6:20,0 --> 0:6:22,77
don't care if your fucked up
on pills, or what, like you


138
0:6:22,77 --> 0:6:24,65
don't go to your fucking video
premiere where everyone in


139
0:6:24,65 --> 0:6:27,81
this team worked hard, and walk
out after your own part.


140
0:6:27,81 --> 0:6:29,56
Just don't even show up if
you're going to do that.


141
0:6:29,56 --> 0:6:31,0
DYLAN RIEDER: Well
I went to it.


142
0:6:31,0 --> 0:6:34,16
It was fucked, like I
was so out of it.


143
0:6:34,16 --> 0:6:35,92
And I remember there
was like no seats.


144
0:6:35,92 --> 0:6:38,48
And I just remember it was like
a really weird situation


145
0:6:38,48 --> 0:6:39,6
in my head.


146
0:6:39,6 --> 0:6:42,2
And I guess there was like seats
saved for me, but I was


147
0:6:42,2 --> 0:6:45,33
so far gone that I didn't
even realize it.


148
0:6:45,33 --> 0:6:48,3
I remember watching my part
and then I just left.


149
0:6:48,3 --> 0:6:50,38
And I remember walking down the
aisle and seeing Carter,


150
0:6:50,38 --> 0:6:51,87
like that's going to be the only
thing I really remember,


151
0:6:51,87 --> 0:6:53,98
like when walking out.


152
0:6:53,98 --> 0:6:55,755
I guess he like super bummed.


153
0:6:55,755 --> 0:6:57,18
INTERVIEWER: He was
bummed you left?


154
0:6:57,18 --> 0:7:0,325
DYLAN RIEDER: Like he was
pretty pissed off.


155
0:7:0,325 --> 0:7:2,58
INTERVIEWER: Did you ever
come out and say shit?


156
0:7:2,58 --> 0:7:4,26
HEATH KIRCHART: I'm not really
that type of guy, because like


157
0:7:4,26 --> 0:7:7,72
I just like keep it bottled up,
and bottled up, and just


158
0:7:7,72 --> 0:7:10,19
slowly, over time, will just
like hate someone.


159
0:7:10,19 --> 0:7:12,32
And just like, be like, all
right well fuck that.


160
0:7:12,32 --> 0:7:14,94
I just hate him now.


161
0:7:14,94 --> 0:7:18,36
And that's kind of like the
way I went with Dylan.


162
0:7:18,36 --> 0:7:20,86
I just like, this fucking kid,
and just like, he would annoy


163
0:7:20,86 --> 0:7:23,34
the fuck out of me.


164
0:7:23,34 --> 0:7:25,7
I just kind of like bottled it
all in, and just turned it


165
0:7:25,7 --> 0:7:26,406
into like hatred towards him.


166
0:7:26,406 --> 0:7:29,38
INTERVIEWER: But, supposedly
that all ended.


167
0:7:29,38 --> 0:7:29,98
And now he's like--


168
0:7:29,98 --> 0:7:31,9
HEATH KIRCHART: Well, yeah, like
that was like, Dylan, I


169
0:7:31,9 --> 0:7:35,2
kind of like, I mean, I was kind
of just over the whole


170
0:7:35,2 --> 0:7:35,78
Dylan thing.


171
0:7:35,78 --> 0:7:38,0
Just like, whatever, like he's
not that motivated to skate,


172
0:7:38,0 --> 0:7:42,6
and he did a lot of bullshit.


173
0:7:42,6 --> 0:7:44,88
He did a lot bullshit, like
walk out on a premier.


174
0:7:44,88 --> 0:7:47,79
You just don't act that way.


175
0:7:47,79 --> 0:7:51,29
But then time went on, and later
on I found out that he


176
0:7:51,29 --> 0:7:52,61
had this gnarly pill
problem, and


177
0:7:52,61 --> 0:7:55,0
everything, kind of got help.


178
0:7:55,0 --> 0:7:57,45
I think, he got ultimatums
from these companies,


179
0:7:57,45 --> 0:8:0,36
basically like listen, like
these checks are here, but


180
0:8:0,36 --> 0:8:2,27
their not yours until you clean
your act up, you're


181
0:8:2,27 --> 0:8:3,13
done, you're cut off.


182
0:8:3,13 --> 0:8:5,12
MARK OBLOW: We were going to
definitely drop him from


183
0:8:5,12 --> 0:8:6,87
Gravis, and drop him
from Analog.


184
0:8:6,87 --> 0:8:10,26
Because it was like, we just
can't keep this going.


185
0:8:10,26 --> 0:8:13,42
There's always excuses, and it
was basically like we tried to


186
0:8:13,42 --> 0:8:18,19
get him to go to rehab that day,
and basically he didn't


187
0:8:18,19 --> 0:8:19,17
want to go.


188
0:8:19,17 --> 0:8:22,35
He wanted to try and
do it on his own.


189
0:8:22,35 --> 0:8:24,98
And I didn't think he could
do it, Moe didn't


190
0:8:24,98 --> 0:8:26,14
think he could do it.


191
0:8:26,14 --> 0:8:29,53
But, the thing with Dylan was he
was always like honest and


192
0:8:29,53 --> 0:8:32,38
straight with us, and so he just
said, hey, give me six


193
0:8:32,38 --> 0:8:36,69
days and if I can't do
it in six days, then


194
0:8:36,69 --> 0:8:37,65
I'll go to a clinic.


195
0:8:37,65 --> 0:8:40,11
So we said fuck, OK.


196
0:8:40,11 --> 0:8:44,26
And no one thought he could do
it, but he actually did it.


197
0:8:44,26 --> 0:8:49,87
DYLAN RIEDER: Fuck man, I just
got my priorities have changed


198
0:8:49,87 --> 0:8:52,26
since that video.


199
0:8:52,26 --> 0:8:55,47
I'm just more focused on my
skating, pretty much.


200
0:8:55,47 --> 0:8:59,2
Like all that shit's in
the past that I did.


201
0:8:59,2 --> 0:9:1,11
I really don't even think about
it anymore, now it's


202
0:9:1,11 --> 0:9:3,5
like a new chapter for me.


203
0:9:3,5 --> 0:9:7,45
GREG HUNT: And I think that's
why now, over the past year,


204
0:9:7,45 --> 0:9:11,56
he's like seriously,
like, on a mission.


205
0:9:11,56 --> 0:9:14,65
So I think now he's like
super on point.


206
0:9:14,65 --> 0:9:16,81
HEATH KIRCHART: I mean, I went
on a trip with him last year,


207
0:9:16,81 --> 0:9:19,86
and completely different
guy, 180--


208
0:9:19,86 --> 0:9:22,95
with skating, really motivated,
just like, wow,


209
0:9:22,95 --> 0:9:26,34
like, everyone's going to the
bar, Dylan's going out with


210
0:9:26,34 --> 0:9:27,943
Greg with the generator
and the lights to


211
0:9:27,943 --> 0:9:29,15
try to go film tricks.


212
0:9:29,15 --> 0:9:31,3
I've seen the tricks
that he's done.


213
0:9:31,3 --> 0:9:36,35
On that trip, I saw stuff that
he did that was like really


214
0:9:36,35 --> 0:9:38,78
impressive, really
impressive stuff.


215
0:9:38,78 --> 0:9:41,17
ANTHONY VAN ENGELEN: I don't
think in the past six months


216
0:9:41,17 --> 0:9:42,96
there hasn't been a time when we
go out, even if it's just a


217
0:9:42,96 --> 0:9:45,28
mellow day, it turns
into a gnarly day.


218
0:9:45,28 --> 0:9:47,18
The kick from Smith was
just something that


219
0:9:47,18 --> 0:9:49,16
happened one day.


220
0:9:49,16 --> 0:9:51,66
I mean, that's just the
testament to what's going on


221
0:9:51,66 --> 0:9:54,12
with him right now, it's just
like that's like something


222
0:9:54,12 --> 0:9:56,66
he'll just wake up
and run into.


223
0:9:56,66 --> 0:9:58,64
I mean, could you imagine then
the shit that he's thinking


224
0:9:58,64 --> 0:9:59,31
about doing?


225
0:9:59,31 --> 0:10:6,96
JASON DILL: What you saw in
Minefield great, super sick.


226
0:10:6,96 --> 0:10:7,59
You have no idea.


227
0:10:7,59 --> 0:10:11,12
I mean the kid is just,
he's in the window.


228
0:10:11,12 --> 0:10:13,84
Me and Abe talk about
the window, 1924


229
0:10:13,84 --> 0:10:15,11
you have this window.


230
0:10:15,11 --> 0:10:20,436
When you're in the window,
you can do anything.


231
0:10:20,436 --> 0:10:25,4
BILL STROBECK: Dylan, he's a
young, agile, skateboarder.


232
0:10:25,4 --> 0:10:27,23
I mean, he's in his
window, for sure.


233
0:10:27,23 --> 0:10:29,39
Like, he's fucking killing
it right now.


234
0:10:29,39 --> 0:10:32,35
ATRO SAARI: The last year now
that I've seen him skate and


235
0:10:32,35 --> 0:10:35,31
going to [INAUDIBLE] and he's
just fucking destroyed it.


236
0:10:35,31 --> 0:10:38,94
Just, fucking manpower,
he's not like this


237
0:10:38,94 --> 0:10:40,3
flimsy little guy.


238
0:10:40,3 --> 0:10:43,29
He's just like stylish, fucking
buffed out, and is


239
0:10:43,29 --> 0:10:44,98
just ready to kill.


240
0:10:44,98 --> 0:10:48,87
Yeah, he's working on this
clip for Gravis.


241
0:10:48,87 --> 0:10:54,93
And I'd say, that's going to
be pretty god damn good.


242
0:10:54,93 --> 0:10:57,71
Not a single filler in it.


243
0:10:57,71 --> 0:11:1,405
This stuff was supposed to be
kind of the bangers of the


244
0:11:1,405 --> 0:11:2,28
Alien video.


245
0:11:2,28 --> 0:11:4,8
He's catching up on
the missing year.


246
0:11:4,8 --> 0:11:7,45
DYLAN RIEDER: Yeah, I'm super
stoked in what I have so far,


247
0:11:7,45 --> 0:11:10,62
I mean, fuck it.


248
0:11:10,62 --> 0:11:15,15
It's such a short period of
time to do video a parts.


249
0:11:15,15 --> 0:11:18,17
I've been filming with Greg
I think a year now.


250
0:11:18,17 --> 0:11:20,26
GREG HUNT: I'd like to think
that people's perception of


251
0:11:20,26 --> 0:11:21,85
Dylan is going to change.


252
0:11:21,85 --> 0:11:24,95
Because I think right now, I
think people don't really--


253
0:11:24,95 --> 0:11:28,9
I think he's kind of like a
little mis-perceived maybe,


254
0:11:28,9 --> 0:11:29,59
you know what I mean?


255
0:11:29,59 --> 0:11:33,53
When this footage comes out, I
think it's going to change a


256
0:11:33,53 --> 0:11:35,55
lot of people's minds because
it's so good.


257
0:11:35,55 --> 0:11:39,67
And it's not just like he's like
technically good, he's


258
0:11:39,67 --> 0:11:41,46
fucking gnarly.


259
0:11:41,46 --> 0:11:43,62
ANTHONY VAN ENGELEN: We all knew
what he was capable of,


260
0:11:43,62 --> 0:11:46,15
but now he finally knows.


261
0:11:46,15 --> 0:11:49,2
He always ripped, but now
he's fucking gnarly.


262
0:11:49,2 --> 0:11:51,98
And I don't know when this thing
comes out, if his thing


263
0:11:51,98 --> 0:11:55,3
will be out, but anybody whose
been talking shit, or


264
0:11:55,3 --> 0:11:59,79
whatever, this kid's like
fucking tough as nails, Dude.


265
0:11:59,79 --> 0:12:2,79
He's like one of the gnarliest
skaters alive right now.


266
0:12:2,79 --> 0:12:7,21
And people will see,
just that.


267
0:12:7,21 --> 0:12:14,55



268
0:12:14,55 --> 0:12:17,3
I don't know, I told them to
film for another two years and


269
0:12:17,3 --> 0:12:19,71
make, Dylan the Movie.


270
0:12:19,71 --> 0:12:21,18
They made one of Bruce Irons.


271
0:12:21,18 --> 0:12:23,33
I thought it was sick.


272
0:12:23,33 --> 0:12:24,56
Bruce Irons the Movie.


273
0:12:24,56 --> 0:12:25,472
INTERVIEWER: Who's that?


274
0:12:25,472 --> 0:12:27,105
ANTHONY VAN ENGELEN:
Pro surfer, Bruce


275
0:12:27,105 --> 0:12:29,67
Irons, Vulcan made it.


276
0:12:29,67 --> 0:12:31,14
They should make fucking
Dylan the Movie.


277
0:12:31,14 --> 0:14:31,14
