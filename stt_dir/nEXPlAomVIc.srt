4
0:2:51,919 --> 0:2:52,79

5
0:2:52,79 --> 0:2:58,499
citing alleged


6
0:2:58,499 --> 0:2:59,399
article


7
0:2:59,399 --> 0:3:3,409
scored in bringing this far down the
road this looks like worksheets


8
0:3:3,409 --> 0:3:6,359
source


9
0:3:6,359 --> 0:3:13,869
assaulted


10
0:3:13,869 --> 0:3:16,79
fetuses


11
0:3:16,79 --> 0:3:22,689
for shit


12
0:3:22,689 --> 0:3:27,769
with a little bit


13
0:3:27,769 --> 0:3:33,379
if there are certainly


14
0:3:33,379 --> 0:3:40,919
repertory resume soon


15
0:3:40,919 --> 0:3:48,19
and seeing all the rest


16
0:3:48,19 --> 0:3:49,759
you want to look at the ranch


17
0:3:49,759 --> 0:3:54,979
this early in the week


18
0:3:54,979 --> 0:3:56,619
looked at


19
0:3:56,619 --> 0:3:58,909
attempt this over the slope


20
0:3:58,909 --> 0:4:1,159
uh...


21
0:4:1,159 --> 0:4:3,499
when it comes down to


22
0:4:3,499 --> 0:4:5,599
is that for the past two years


23
0:4:5,599 --> 0:4:9,4
de la mot has had the piss poorest
record of any united states border


24
0:4:9,4 --> 0:4:15,849
patrol sector in the south and state of
texas cast


25
0:4:15,849 --> 0:4:17,419
it's likely to get on that


26
0:4:17,419 --> 0:4:20,239
the attitude of this division


27
0:4:20,239 --> 0:4:22,449
sucks


28
0:4:22,449 --> 0:4:26,26
it is so bad that i have been required
to take steps


29
0:4:26,26 --> 0:4:28,279
to ameliorate the situation


30
0:4:28,279 --> 0:4:31,669
mister lacey has come all the way from
washington d_c_


31
0:4:31,669 --> 0:4:35,539
to demonstrate a system which he himself
has devised his invention will prove a


32
0:4:35,539 --> 0:4:39,499
great whom to all of us in the
accomplishment of our goals


33
0:4:39,499 --> 0:4:46,22
so we get those plans


34
0:4:46,22 --> 0:4:50,199
pakistanis


35
0:4:50,199 --> 0:4:55,149
this map like matrix you're looking at
represents an area forty square miles


36
0:4:55,149 --> 0:4:56,91
the import


37
0:4:56,91 --> 0:4:58,499
generated


38
0:4:58,499 --> 0:5:0,3
ideal sensors


39
0:5:0,3 --> 0:5:3,71
small electronic modules of one of the
earth covenants


40
0:5:3,71 --> 0:5:4,86
and so sensitive


41
0:5:4,86 --> 0:5:6,84
will pick up the quantum and park


42
0:5:6,84 --> 0:5:10,34
every guy declines in their private a
search on across the border


43
0:5:10,34 --> 0:5:12,59
it it


44
0:5:12,59 --> 0:5:15,84
that's enough


45
0:5:15,84 --> 0:5:19,879
any activity in the neighborhood you'll
sensors will generate a signal on screen


46
0:5:19,879 --> 0:5:21,539
like this


47
0:5:21,539 --> 0:5:24,339
there for example you can observe an
imaginary illegal aliens heading from


48
0:5:24,339 --> 0:5:27,759
quadrant c_-five quadrant c six


49
0:5:27,759 --> 0:5:29,969
well how do you regulate the underwear


50
0:5:29,969 --> 0:5:34,8
oh question it


51
0:5:34,8 --> 0:5:37,74
or the army leader i mean how do you
uh... keep it from malfunction since to


52
0:5:37,74 --> 0:5:40,689
fix it asshole fast enough


53
0:5:40,689 --> 0:5:42,529
why it


54
0:5:42,529 --> 0:5:45,83
as i say dislike most artificial so to
speak


55
0:5:45,83 --> 0:5:49,699
the actual geol sensors will be buried
throughout her sectors muriel gluck


56
0:5:49,699 --> 0:5:51,479
bertelsmann


57
0:5:51,479 --> 0:5:52,909
that's right


58
0:5:52,909 --> 0:5:54,37
then transmit signal


59
0:5:54,37 --> 0:5:58,68
to this console whenever an illegal
alien enters the area with a very


60
0:5:58,68 --> 0:6:4,819
but shortly so stay sensitivity two feet
and that


61
0:6:4,819 --> 0:6:5,75
brittany


62
0:6:5,75 --> 0:6:7,34
p_g_ or sensors


63
0:6:7,34 --> 0:6:9,879
or we detect objects appalled

70
0:6:29,29 --> 0:6:33,29
effect us it'll be a need for so many
agents on patrol


71
0:6:33,29 --> 0:6:38,49
means consumable savings for tax payer
what what you're trying to say here's


72
0:6:38,49 --> 0:6:42,43
once we go on but stars planning state


73
0:6:42,43 --> 0:6:44,889

whatever distresses me we should have
been asked


86
0:7:26,69 --> 0:7:29,529
we didn't sign on to the border patrol
here to mess with computers and radar


87
0:7:29,529 --> 0:7:31,2
screens


88
0:7:31,2 --> 0:7:34,4
a lot of us in a room here turned out
promotions


89
0:7:34,4 --> 0:7:36,8
because we didn't want bestjobs


90
0:7:36,8 --> 0:7:40,61
