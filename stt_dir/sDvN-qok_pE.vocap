###0 Look upon my works ye mighty, and despair.
###4 I was recently described as a ubiquitous know-it-all.
###7 I'm an author and journalist.
###8 In the past, I was responsible for making London's Design
###11 Museum and was briefly, hilariously, and
###13 catastrophically, the creative director of
###16 the Millennium Dome.
###17 What's deplorable about the Olympic merchandise, it
###21 assumes a very low level of
###24 intelligence amongst the public.
###26 How is the person who consumes this bit of tat going to be
###29 changed or enhanced by possession of it?
###32 It's ugly, it's cynical, and it's stupid.
###36 Several design principles have been violated here.
###38 This is an ugly travesty.
###41 Mindless, stupid, cynical, patronizing, exploitative,
###46 manipulative, ugly, and useless.
###50 We want to revive our industry and revive the credibility of
###53 our great nation by putting something like this for sale?
###57 I mean what purpose is this meant to serve?
###59 It's not a clever photograph, and it shows this sort of
###63 laborious conceit of the London Eye as a target.
###68 Given the ever-present threat of terrorist activity, that
###71 seems to me to be an unfortunate lapse of taste.
###75 But I think al-Qaeda is probably too--
###77 I think their aesthetics are too advanced to take much
###79 interest in this sort of thing.
###81 Appalling.
