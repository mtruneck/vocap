1
0:1:19,209 --> 0:1:20,667
- Ladies and gentlemen,


2
0:1:20,667 --> 0:1:23,209
lot 22:


3
0:1:23,209 --> 0:1:26,459
an Edgar Brandt
wrought-iron wall mirror


4
0:1:26,459 --> 0:1:28,5
and console table.


5
0:1:28,5 --> 0:1:33,875
I shall open the bidding
at £30.


6
0:1:33,875 --> 0:1:37,84
Do I see £30?


7
0:1:37,84 --> 0:1:38,209
£30.


8
0:1:38,209 --> 0:1:39,625
- Is this what you came for,
Poirot?


9
0:1:39,625 --> 0:1:40,792
- Yes, it is, Hastings.


10
0:1:40,792 --> 0:1:42,917
I thought for the vestibule,
you know, by the door.


11
0:1:42,917 --> 0:1:44,125
- £40.


12
0:1:44,125 --> 0:1:45,417
- How high will you go?


13
0:1:45,417 --> 0:1:46,75
- £90.


14
0:1:46,75 --> 0:1:48,42
- £50.
- It will be enough.


15
0:1:48,42 --> 0:1:49,834
- Thank you.


16
0:1:49,834 --> 0:1:51,417
- £60.


17
0:1:51,417 --> 0:1:56,875
And £70.


18
0:1:56,875 --> 0:1:58,84
- Here.


19
0:1:58,84 --> 0:2:0,459
- £80.
Thank you, madam.


20
0:2:0,459 --> 0:2:3,625
£90.


21
0:2:3,625 --> 0:2:6,5
At £90, then.


22
0:2:6,5 --> 0:2:9,42
At £90.


23
0:2:9,42 --> 0:2:11,167
Any more?


24
0:2:11,167 --> 0:2:19,375
- £100.


25
0:2:19,375 --> 0:2:26,125
- It's with you, sir.


26
0:2:26,125 --> 0:2:36,584
- £120.


27
0:2:36,584 --> 0:2:41,459
- Sir?


28
0:2:41,459 --> 0:2:44,334
At £120, then.


29
0:2:44,334 --> 0:2:46,5
Any more?


30
0:2:46,5 --> 0:2:51,375
Sold to Mr. Chevenix.


31
0:2:51,375 --> 0:2:53,625
- Well, that was a bit
of bad luck, Poirot.


32
0:2:53,625 --> 0:2:54,834
I thought you had it there.


33
0:2:54,834 --> 0:2:56,84
- So, Hastings, did I.


34
0:2:56,84 --> 0:2:57,542
- Mr. Poirot.


35
0:2:57,542 --> 0:2:59,917
You are Hercule Poirot,
are you not,


36
0:2:59,917 --> 0:3:1,417
the detective?


37
0:3:1,417 --> 0:3:2,584
- Yes.


38
0:3:2,584 --> 0:3:4,875
- No hard feelings, I hope?


39
0:3:4,875 --> 0:3:6,292
- Non.


40
0:3:6,292 --> 0:3:9,84
- Good. My card.


41
0:3:9,84 --> 0:3:13,125
Tell me, what do you know
about modern art, Mr. Poirot?


42
0:3:13,125 --> 0:3:14,209
I'm a collector.


43
0:3:14,209 --> 0:3:16,334
Also I deal in paintings
and sculptures.


44
0:3:16,334 --> 0:3:17,459
That's my business.


45
0:3:17,459 --> 0:3:19,209
And I have to tell you,


46
0:3:19,209 --> 0:3:22,42
I'm not a man
who's easily fooled.


47
0:3:22,42 --> 0:3:23,875
- That is self-evident,
monsieur.


48
0:3:23,875 --> 0:3:25,334
- So it may surprise you
to learn


49
0:3:25,334 --> 0:3:27,334
that I believe
I'm being defrauded.


50
0:3:27,334 --> 0:3:29,5
I want you
to look into it.


51
0:3:29,5 --> 0:3:32,209
- The services of Hercule Poirot
are not inexpensive.


52
0:3:32,209 --> 0:3:33,625
- Maybe I'll give you
the mirror.


53
0:3:33,625 --> 0:3:34,959
What do you say?


54
0:3:34,959 --> 0:3:36,584
I've got a place,
Hamborough Close,


55
0:3:36,584 --> 0:3:37,917
near Whimperley.


56
0:3:37,917 --> 0:3:39,584
How about tomorrow?


57
0:3:39,584 --> 0:3:41,375
- That is out of the question.


58
0:3:41,375 --> 0:3:42,584
- The day after, then.


59
0:3:42,584 --> 0:3:45,417
Let me know.


60
0:3:45,417 --> 0:3:47,834
- Well, that was a bit
of a cheek, wasn't it?


61
0:3:47,834 --> 0:3:49,917
- Yes, indeed, Hastings.


62
0:3:49,917 --> 0:3:54,5
This Gervase Chevenix,


63
0:3:54,5 --> 0:3:55,917
it does not occur to him


64
0:3:55,917 --> 0:3:58,25
that Poirot is also
a man of importance,


65
0:3:58,25 --> 0:4:0,917
a man of affairs?


66
0:4:0,917 --> 0:4:4,0
And yet he summons me like
a mere nobody, an obedient dog.


67
0:4:4,0 --> 0:4:5,959
- Oh, I take it you'll refuse.


68
0:4:5,959 --> 0:4:9,84
- To refuse, yes,
it is my first instinct.


69
0:4:9,84 --> 0:4:10,417
But, you know, Hastings,


70
0:4:10,417 --> 0:4:14,959
a man with so much arrogance
as this...


71
0:4:14,959 --> 0:4:18,417
Even he may be vulnerable
in ways he cannot see.


72
0:4:18,417 --> 0:4:21,584
- And he did offer you
that mirror.


73
0:4:21,584 --> 0:4:24,25
- That too.


74
0:4:24,25 --> 0:4:28,5
- I'll get the tickets
tomorrow.


75
0:4:28,5 --> 0:4:30,917
- And do you take this man


76
0:4:30,917 --> 0:4:34,375
to be
your lawfully wedded husband?


77
0:4:34,375 --> 0:4:36,167
- I do.


78
0:4:36,167 --> 0:4:37,959
- Well, there we are, then.


79
0:4:37,959 --> 0:4:41,334
Now, let me see.


80
0:4:41,334 --> 0:4:42,834
Do you have a ring?


81
0:4:42,834 --> 0:4:45,709
- Yes.


82
0:4:45,709 --> 0:4:49,459
- That's right.


83
0:4:49,459 --> 0:4:52,459
John Lake, Ruth Chevenix,


84
0:4:52,459 --> 0:5:1,792
I am pleased to declare you
man and wife.


85
0:5:1,792 --> 0:5:13,167
- I wish it didn't have
to be like this.


86
0:5:13,167 --> 0:5:35,167
- I do love you.


87
0:5:35,167 --> 0:5:45,5
- Merci.


88
0:5:45,5 --> 0:5:47,42
- Mr. Poirot?
- Oui?


89
0:5:47,42 --> 0:5:48,792
- My name's Susan Cardwell.


90
0:5:48,792 --> 0:5:50,709
Do you mind if I join you?


91
0:5:50,709 --> 0:5:52,84
- Not at all, mademoiselle.


92
0:5:52,84 --> 0:5:57,834
Asseyez-vous,
s'il vous plaît.


93
0:5:57,834 --> 0:5:59,75
This is my associate,
Captain Hastings.


94
0:5:59,75 --> 0:6:0,792
How do you do?


95
0:6:0,792 --> 0:6:2,292
- May I offer you
a cup of coffee?


96
0:6:2,292 --> 0:6:4,625
- Oh, I won't, thank you.


97
0:6:4,625 --> 0:6:7,584
My fiancé, Hugo,
told me to look out for you.


98
0:6:7,584 --> 0:6:9,709
Actually, he's not my fiancé,


99
0:6:9,709 --> 0:6:11,125
not officially, anyway.


100
0:6:11,125 --> 0:6:12,334
- Hugo?


101
0:6:12,334 --> 0:6:13,667
- Oh, Hugo Trent,


102
0:6:13,667 --> 0:6:14,834
Gervase's nephew.


103
0:6:14,834 --> 0:6:16,84
He's meeting you at the station,


104
0:6:16,84 --> 0:6:18,834
so he suggested
I come on the same train.


105
0:6:18,834 --> 0:6:21,42
- Are you staying
with Monsieur Chevenix?


106
0:6:21,42 --> 0:6:23,709
- Unfortunately, yes.


107
0:6:23,709 --> 0:6:25,125
Well, I've only met him once,


108
0:6:25,125 --> 0:6:29,0
and he was
absolutely horrible to me.


109
0:6:29,0 --> 0:6:31,42
- He doesn't approve of you?


110
0:6:31,42 --> 0:6:33,209
- It's not that.
It's just--


111
0:6:33,209 --> 0:6:36,209
Well, it's--
it's Hugo and me.


112
0:6:36,209 --> 0:6:38,84
You see, Gervase
has always had his heart set


113
0:6:38,84 --> 0:6:40,42
on Hugo marrying
his daughter, Ruth.


114
0:6:40,42 --> 0:6:42,5
- But he's not inclined
to do that.


115
0:6:42,5 --> 0:6:44,25
- No.


116
0:6:44,25 --> 0:6:46,84
But you see,
Ruth was adopted.


117
0:6:46,84 --> 0:6:48,792
I suppose Gervase thinks
marrying her to his nephew


118
0:6:48,792 --> 0:6:53,209
will--will make her
more completely his.


119
0:6:53,209 --> 0:6:55,375
- But he can't force them
to marry, can he?


120
0:6:55,375 --> 0:6:56,917
- He can try.


121
0:6:56,917 --> 0:6:58,792
He will try.


122
0:6:58,792 --> 0:7:0,375
I think he enjoys it--


123
0:7:0,375 --> 0:7:5,417
manipulating other people.


124
0:7:5,417 --> 0:7:7,42
I really hate him, you know.


125
0:7:7,42 --> 0:7:8,542
I do.


126
0:7:8,542 --> 0:7:23,5
And I'm not going to let him
spoil my life.


127
0:7:23,5 --> 0:7:25,84
Here's Hugo.


128
0:7:25,84 --> 0:7:26,584
- Susan.


129
0:7:26,584 --> 0:7:28,209
Darling.
- Mwah.


130
0:7:28,209 --> 0:7:29,959
- You must be Mr. Poirot.


131
0:7:29,959 --> 0:7:31,42
- Monsieur.


132
0:7:31,42 --> 0:7:32,834
- And...
- Arthur Hastings.


133
0:7:32,834 --> 0:7:34,584
- Hugo Trent.


134
0:7:34,584 --> 0:7:37,417
Look, I'm supposed to be
driving you to Hamborough Close.


135
0:7:37,417 --> 0:7:39,584
But I've got to stop off
at my studio.


136
0:7:39,584 --> 0:7:40,792
Do you mind terribly?


137
0:7:40,792 --> 0:7:42,25
- Not at all.
- It's on the way.


138
0:7:42,25 --> 0:7:47,334
- Bon.


139
0:7:47,334 --> 0:7:49,375
- And these are my designs,


140
0:7:49,375 --> 0:7:51,209
all of them.


141
0:7:51,209 --> 0:7:54,625
What we're doing here
is revolutionary, Mr. Poirot.


142
0:7:54,625 --> 0:7:56,709
What do you think?


143
0:7:56,709 --> 0:7:59,709
- I think
it is most remarkable.


144
0:7:59,709 --> 0:8:1,292
- Is it all metal?


145
0:8:1,292 --> 0:8:2,667
- Tubular steel.


146
0:8:2,667 --> 0:8:5,209
You see, who needs wood,
Captain Hastings?


147
0:8:5,209 --> 0:8:7,875
Wood expands. It perishes.
It dries out.


148
0:8:7,875 --> 0:8:10,792
But metal, metal is perfect.


149
0:8:10,792 --> 0:8:13,417
You see, triangulated joinery.


150
0:8:13,417 --> 0:8:14,584
There's no fuss.


151
0:8:14,584 --> 0:8:16,125
- Oh, yes, I see.


152
0:8:16,125 --> 0:8:20,75
- Hugo.
- Give me a minute, Lawrence.


153
0:8:20,75 --> 0:8:22,875
Look at this.


154
0:8:22,875 --> 0:8:35,167
Sit down.


155
0:8:35,167 --> 0:8:36,417
What do you think?


156
0:8:36,417 --> 0:8:39,5
- I think...


157
0:8:39,5 --> 0:8:42,667
that it is perfectly conceived.


158
0:8:42,667 --> 0:8:44,917
- This is the future,
Mr. Poirot.


159
0:8:44,917 --> 0:8:47,292
And I could sell thousands,
if only--


160
0:8:47,292 --> 0:8:49,5
- Uncle Gervase.


161
0:8:49,5 --> 0:8:51,542
- He does not support
this enterprise?


162
0:8:51,542 --> 0:8:54,417
- Just getting this far
has been a struggle.


163
0:8:54,417 --> 0:8:56,0
Now the banks are closing in,


164
0:8:56,0 --> 0:8:57,709
and I may have to sell
my designs


165
0:8:57,709 --> 0:8:58,834
just to pay them off.


166
0:8:58,834 --> 0:8:59,959
- Hugo.


167
0:8:59,959 --> 0:9:1,917
They telephoned
while you were out.


168
0:9:1,917 --> 0:9:3,792
They won't give you
any more time.


169
0:9:3,792 --> 0:9:5,834
- I'll have to speak to them.


170
0:9:5,834 --> 0:9:8,459
Excuse me, Mr. Poirot.


171
0:9:8,459 --> 0:9:11,584
Lawrence will have
to drive you.


172
0:9:11,584 --> 0:9:40,459
Damn it to hell.


173
0:9:40,459 --> 0:9:43,417
- Mm.
Quite a place.


174
0:9:43,417 --> 0:9:44,75
- Good afternoon, gentlemen.


175
0:9:44,75 --> 0:9:46,375
Mr. Chevenix
is waiting for you.


176
0:9:46,375 --> 0:9:47,792
- Merci.


177
0:9:47,792 --> 0:9:52,417
- Enter!


178
0:9:52,417 --> 0:9:54,0
- Monsieur Poirot, sir.


179
0:9:54,0 --> 0:9:55,959
- Oh, Mr. Poirot.


180
0:9:55,959 --> 0:9:58,42
Good of you to come.


181
0:9:58,42 --> 0:10:1,0
You've brought your secretary.


182
0:10:1,0 --> 0:10:4,542
- This is my associate,
Captain Hastings.


183
0:10:4,542 --> 0:10:5,667
- Oh, yes.


184
0:10:5,667 --> 0:10:7,584
I saw him at the auction.


185
0:10:7,584 --> 0:10:9,25
Well, what do you think?


186
0:10:9,25 --> 0:10:10,417
Hung it this morning.


187
0:10:10,417 --> 0:10:12,5
Looks good, doesn't it?


188
0:10:12,5 --> 0:10:14,542
- Yes, indeed.


189
0:10:14,542 --> 0:10:17,42
- Shall I come back later,
Mr. Chevenix?


190
0:10:17,42 --> 0:10:18,209
- Yes.


191
0:10:18,209 --> 0:10:20,959
You can sort out
that stuff on Matisse.


192
0:10:20,959 --> 0:10:24,292
This is Miss Lingard,
my research assistant.


193
0:10:24,292 --> 0:10:25,625
- How do you do?


194
0:10:25,625 --> 0:10:26,834
- Mademoiselle Lingard.


195
0:10:26,834 --> 0:10:29,334
- We're working
on a study of fauvism


196
0:10:29,334 --> 0:10:32,292
for the British Museum
of Modern Art.


197
0:10:32,292 --> 0:10:34,292
Oh, Miss Lingard,


198
0:10:34,292 --> 0:10:36,792
is that architect here?


199
0:10:36,792 --> 0:10:38,959
- I believe so,
Mr. Chevenix.


200
0:10:38,959 --> 0:10:43,42
- Have him come in,
will you?


201
0:10:43,42 --> 0:10:45,875
£10,000, Mr. Poirot--


202
0:10:45,875 --> 0:10:47,875
not a drop in the ocean.


203
0:10:47,875 --> 0:10:51,42
That's how much I've paid him,
John Lake.


204
0:10:51,42 --> 0:10:53,5
- And this is the fraud
you wish me to investigate?


205
0:10:53,5 --> 0:10:55,167
- Yes.


206
0:10:55,167 --> 0:10:57,292
- For what purpose
did you give him the money?


207
0:10:57,292 --> 0:10:59,5
- A big development
in London:


208
0:10:59,5 --> 0:11:1,917
shops, offices, apartments.


209
0:11:1,917 --> 0:11:5,84
He's building it,
and he's gotten me to invest.


210
0:11:5,84 --> 0:11:7,709
So far, he hasn't even
laid a brick.


211
0:11:7,709 --> 0:11:13,209
And I'm beginning to wonder
if he ever will.


212
0:11:13,209 --> 0:11:14,875
- You wanted to see me,
Gervase?


213
0:11:14,875 --> 0:11:16,459
- Come in, Lake.


214
0:11:16,459 --> 0:11:18,625
There's someone
I want you to meet.


215
0:11:18,625 --> 0:11:22,167
This is Hercule Poirot.


216
0:11:22,167 --> 0:11:23,917
- The detective.


217
0:11:23,917 --> 0:11:26,5
- Yes.


218
0:11:26,5 --> 0:11:28,792
Why don't you take Mr. Poirot
into the garden


219
0:11:28,792 --> 0:11:30,75
and get him some tea?


220
0:11:30,75 --> 0:11:32,42
I'll see you at dinner.


221
0:11:32,42 --> 0:11:33,792
We'll eat in the hall,
quarter past 8:00.


222
0:11:33,792 --> 0:11:35,875
Do try not to be late.


223
0:11:35,875 --> 0:11:39,125
Snell rings the first gong
at eight minutes past the hour


224
0:11:39,125 --> 0:11:40,875
and the second at 8:15.


225
0:11:40,875 --> 0:11:42,959
I'll see you then.


226
0:11:42,959 --> 0:11:53,667
- Gentlemen.


227
0:11:53,667 --> 0:11:57,42
I--I don't suppose--


228
0:11:57,42 --> 0:11:59,5
You're not here on business,
Mr. Poirot.


229
0:11:59,5 --> 0:12:1,875
- That is precisely
why I am here, Monsieur Lake.


230
0:12:1,875 --> 0:12:3,292
- Oh.


231
0:12:3,292 --> 0:12:4,875
That's typical of Gervase.


232
0:12:4,875 --> 0:12:13,542
He likes to spring
his surprises.


233
0:12:13,542 --> 0:12:15,375
Let me introduce you.


234
0:12:15,375 --> 0:12:17,459
This is Mrs. Vanda Chevenix.


235
0:12:17,459 --> 0:12:19,292
Hercule Poirot,
Captain Hastings.


236
0:12:19,292 --> 0:12:21,542
- Madame.
- How do you do?


237
0:12:21,542 --> 0:12:24,417
- And her daughter,
Miss Chevenix.


238
0:12:24,417 --> 0:12:26,5
- Ruth.


239
0:12:26,5 --> 0:12:28,292
- Mademoiselle.
- Hello.


240
0:12:28,292 --> 0:12:30,584
- Hello.


241
0:12:30,584 --> 0:12:34,125
- Apparently, Mr. Poirot is
doing some work for your father.


242
0:12:34,125 --> 0:12:35,459
- For Gervase?


243
0:12:35,459 --> 0:12:36,625
Really?


244
0:12:36,625 --> 0:12:37,875
- Oui.


245
0:12:37,875 --> 0:12:41,5
- It is about the death.


246
0:12:41,5 --> 0:12:43,709
- What death,
Madame Chevenix?


247
0:12:43,709 --> 0:12:47,75
- Safra warned me
there would be a death.


248
0:12:47,75 --> 0:12:50,42
She told me
not to be afraid.


249
0:12:50,42 --> 0:12:52,5
- Who's Safra?


250
0:12:52,5 --> 0:12:56,125
- She was a servant
of Amenhotep.


251
0:12:56,125 --> 0:12:58,5
She is my spiritual guide.


252
0:12:58,5 --> 0:13:0,292
- Oh, come on, Vanda.


253
0:13:0,292 --> 0:13:3,167
I'm sure Mr. Poirot doesn't want
to hear about all that.


254
0:13:3,167 --> 0:13:5,334
- Au contraire, mademoiselle.


255
0:13:5,334 --> 0:13:11,417
Poirot interests himself always
in matters of the occult.


256
0:13:11,417 --> 0:13:14,42
You permit?


257
0:13:14,42 --> 0:13:26,209
Merci.


258
0:13:26,209 --> 0:13:27,875
It is very old.


259
0:13:27,875 --> 0:13:32,459
- It is 3,000 years old.


260
0:13:32,459 --> 0:13:33,75
It was hers.


261
0:13:33,75 --> 0:13:37,417
- This belonged to Safra?


262
0:13:37,417 --> 0:13:40,167
- She is never wrong.


263
0:13:40,167 --> 0:13:41,625
- I...


264
0:13:41,625 --> 0:13:43,709
I think I'd better be going.


265
0:13:43,709 --> 0:13:45,667
- I'll walk round with you.


266
0:13:45,667 --> 0:13:47,42
Excuse me.


267
0:13:47,42 --> 0:13:49,667
- Right.


268
0:13:49,667 --> 0:14:11,42
- Tea?


269
0:14:11,42 --> 0:14:12,292
- Evening, Hugo.


270
0:14:12,292 --> 0:14:13,75
- Where are you going, Ruth?


271
0:14:13,75 --> 0:14:15,84
- I dropped my brooch somewhere.


272
0:14:15,84 --> 0:14:16,209
Outside, I think.


273
0:14:16,209 --> 0:14:17,625
- Oh.


274
0:14:17,625 --> 0:14:19,42
- Have you spoken to Gervase?


275
0:14:19,42 --> 0:14:20,125
- Yes.


276
0:14:20,125 --> 0:14:50,917
He's impossible.


277
0:14:50,917 --> 0:14:54,167
- Entrez.


278
0:14:54,167 --> 0:14:56,25
- Oh, you're not ready yet.


279
0:14:56,25 --> 0:14:58,292
- Well, we have plenty of time,
mon ami.


280
0:14:58,292 --> 0:14:59,459
- Are you sure?


281
0:14:59,459 --> 0:15:2,167
I could have sworn
I heard the first gong.


282
0:15:2,167 --> 0:15:10,125
- Non.
Let me see.


283
0:15:10,125 --> 0:16:3,334
Non, it is
six minutes past 8:00 only.


284
0:16:3,334 --> 0:16:5,5
- What was that?
- I do not know.


285
0:16:5,5 --> 0:16:17,542
- It was a gunshot.


286
0:16:17,542 --> 0:16:20,792
- Good evening, Miss Ruth.


287
0:16:20,792 --> 0:16:28,125
- Oh, good evening,
Miss Lingard.


288
0:16:28,125 --> 0:16:31,792
Is something the matter?


289
0:16:31,792 --> 0:16:33,125
- I'm not late, am I?


290
0:16:33,125 --> 0:16:34,625
- Did you hear it, Susan?
- What?


291
0:16:34,625 --> 0:16:36,125
- I thought I heard a shot.


292
0:16:36,125 --> 0:16:37,292
- Just now?


293
0:16:37,292 --> 0:16:39,459
I thought it was
a car backfiring.


294
0:16:39,459 --> 0:16:40,5
- Ruth.


295
0:16:40,5 --> 0:16:41,792
- What's going on?


296
0:16:41,792 --> 0:16:44,167
- We thought we heard
a gun going off.


297
0:16:44,167 --> 0:16:45,917
- Oh, yes, I thought
I heard something.


298
0:16:45,917 --> 0:16:48,584
- It came from upstairs.


299
0:16:48,584 --> 0:16:49,792
- No, it was a car.


300
0:16:49,792 --> 0:16:50,875
It came from over there.


301
0:16:50,875 --> 0:16:52,167
- I heard it too.


302
0:16:52,167 --> 0:16:55,417
- Snell?


303
0:16:55,417 --> 0:16:56,709
- Yes, ma'am.


304
0:16:56,709 --> 0:16:58,834
- It is 8:15.


305
0:16:58,834 --> 0:17:0,5
Time for the second gong.


306
0:17:0,5 --> 0:17:3,667
- Yes, ma'am.


307
0:17:3,667 --> 0:17:6,42
- But where
is Monsieur Chevenix?


308
0:17:6,42 --> 0:17:8,25
- He is never late.


309
0:17:8,25 --> 0:17:25,375
- He was working in the study,
ma'am.


310
0:17:25,375 --> 0:17:27,542
- This door must be broken open
immediately.


311
0:17:27,542 --> 0:17:55,625
- Here, let me.


312
0:17:55,625 --> 0:18:4,625
- Poirot.


313
0:18:4,625 --> 0:18:41,792
- I told you,
Safra is never wrong.


314
0:18:41,792 --> 0:18:43,209
- Evening, Poirot.


315
0:18:43,209 --> 0:18:44,792
- Chief Inspector Japp.


316
0:18:44,792 --> 0:18:46,292
- Right, where's the body?


317
0:18:46,292 --> 0:18:55,792
- This way, Chief Inspector.


318
0:18:55,792 --> 0:19:15,667
Chief Inspector.


319
0:19:15,667 --> 0:19:16,709
- Suicide.


320
0:19:16,709 --> 0:19:18,375
- So it would appear.


321
0:19:18,375 --> 0:19:19,917
- I'd say it was obvious.


322
0:19:19,917 --> 0:19:21,875
The bullet must have gone
straight through his head


323
0:19:21,875 --> 0:19:25,84
and hit the mirror.


324
0:19:25,84 --> 0:19:31,25
- So it would appear.


325
0:19:31,25 --> 0:19:37,5
- He left a note.


326
0:19:37,5 --> 0:19:40,209
"Sorry."


327
0:19:40,209 --> 0:19:42,917
I suppose that says it all.


328
0:19:42,917 --> 0:19:44,42
- Hmm.


329
0:19:44,42 --> 0:19:51,0
Look at this,
Chief Inspector.


330
0:19:51,0 --> 0:19:52,959
- What is it?


331
0:19:52,959 --> 0:19:56,0
- It is a small fragment
of the looking glass.


332
0:19:56,0 --> 0:19:58,25
- Well, there must be splinters
all over the place.


333
0:19:58,25 --> 0:19:59,667
Who found the body?


334
0:19:59,667 --> 0:20:0,875
- We did.


335
0:20:0,875 --> 0:20:2,792
We heard a shot
at about ten past 8:00,


336
0:20:2,792 --> 0:20:15,959
and then we broke in the door.


337
0:20:15,959 --> 0:20:20,834
- Let me see.


338
0:20:20,834 --> 0:20:21,875
Ah.


339
0:20:21,875 --> 0:20:23,584
Just as I thought.


340
0:20:23,584 --> 0:20:25,375
He locked himself in.


341
0:20:25,375 --> 0:20:27,625
That more or less wraps it up.


342
0:20:27,625 --> 0:20:29,667
- You believe so?


343
0:20:29,667 --> 0:20:32,0
- Well, we've got a dead man.


344
0:20:32,0 --> 0:20:34,42
You heard a shot,
he's alone in the room,


345
0:20:34,42 --> 0:20:36,84
the gun's in his hand,
and the door was locked.


346
0:20:36,84 --> 0:20:44,75
- Well, what about the windows?


347
0:20:44,75 --> 0:20:46,209
- Fastened.


348
0:20:46,209 --> 0:20:53,584
- And this one.


349
0:20:53,584 --> 0:20:55,334
- This one too.


350
0:20:55,334 --> 0:20:56,625
Right.


351
0:20:56,625 --> 0:20:57,875
Well, I'd better go
and have a word


352
0:20:57,875 --> 0:20:59,5
with Mrs. Chevenix,


353
0:20:59,5 --> 0:21:6,542
not that there's much to say.


354
0:21:6,542 --> 0:21:9,625
You know, it does look
like suicide, Poirot.


355
0:21:9,625 --> 0:21:12,417
- Oui, c'est possible,
mon ami.


356
0:21:12,417 --> 0:21:14,709
And yet...


357
0:21:14,709 --> 0:21:26,334
there are many things
I wish to know.


358
0:21:26,334 --> 0:21:28,75
For example,


359
0:21:28,75 --> 0:21:30,542
why was the mirror broken?


360
0:21:30,542 --> 0:21:32,292
And why was there mud
on the shoes


361
0:21:32,292 --> 0:21:36,42
belonging
to Mademoiselle Ruth Chevenix?


362
0:21:36,42 --> 0:21:38,42
Voilà.


363
0:21:38,42 --> 0:21:39,584
- Footprints.


364
0:21:39,584 --> 0:21:41,667
- Yes, Hastings, they are
the footprints of a lady


365
0:21:41,667 --> 0:21:44,84
and directly outside the study
of Monsieur Chevenix.


366
0:21:44,84 --> 0:21:46,709
- But the French window
was locked from the inside.


367
0:21:46,709 --> 0:21:47,917
- But this window, Hastings,


368
0:21:47,917 --> 0:21:49,5
it can be locked
from the outside.


369
0:21:49,5 --> 0:21:53,167
Regarde.


370
0:21:53,167 --> 0:21:57,584
By raising the metal catch so


371
0:21:57,584 --> 0:22:3,875
and then, with a push...


372
0:22:3,875 --> 0:22:9,292
- Good Lord.


373
0:22:9,292 --> 0:22:11,917
- You know, Chief Inspector,


374
0:22:11,917 --> 0:22:17,459
life is one
of the great illusions.


375
0:22:17,459 --> 0:22:20,917
- I'm afraid I don't quite agree
with that, Mrs. Chevenix.


376
0:22:20,917 --> 0:22:23,959
- Gervase knew that.


377
0:22:23,959 --> 0:22:26,167
He and I, you see,


378
0:22:26,167 --> 0:22:29,417
we met on the same plane.


379
0:22:29,417 --> 0:22:31,625
- On holiday?


380
0:22:31,625 --> 0:22:35,167
- The spiritual plane.


381
0:22:35,167 --> 0:22:38,417
He was one of the great ones.


382
0:22:38,417 --> 0:22:40,959
He, too, found it hard
to conform


383
0:22:40,959 --> 0:22:47,167
to the silly standards
of the everyday world.


384
0:22:47,167 --> 0:22:50,459
And he believed me


385
0:22:50,459 --> 0:22:53,75
about the death.


386
0:22:53,75 --> 0:22:57,417
- You'd been told
about his death?


387
0:22:57,417 --> 0:23:1,84
- Oh, yes.


388
0:23:1,84 --> 0:23:3,584
Safra told me.


389
0:23:3,584 --> 0:23:5,75
She knew.


390
0:23:5,75 --> 0:23:8,75
- Did she, indeed?


391
0:23:8,75 --> 0:23:11,0
Mrs. Chevenix,
can you tell me


392
0:23:11,0 --> 0:23:15,834
where I might be able
to get hold of this Safra?


393
0:23:15,834 --> 0:23:19,167
- She used to live in Egypt.


394
0:23:19,167 --> 0:23:21,959
- But she moved?


395
0:23:21,959 --> 0:23:23,5
- No.


396
0:23:23,5 --> 0:23:26,5
- Perfectly conceived.


397
0:23:26,5 --> 0:23:27,834
- Oh, hello, Mr. Poirot.


398
0:23:27,834 --> 0:23:31,375
- Oh, Mr. Poirot.


399
0:23:31,375 --> 0:23:35,84
- Monsieur Trent...


400
0:23:35,84 --> 0:23:38,375
Did you see your uncle
earlier this evening?


401
0:23:38,375 --> 0:23:40,42
- Yes.


402
0:23:40,42 --> 0:23:42,209
It must have been about 7:00.


403
0:23:42,209 --> 0:23:44,84
He was dressed for dinner.


404
0:23:44,84 --> 0:23:45,542
I--I went to see him


405
0:23:45,542 --> 0:23:47,25
to ask him to help me
with my business.


406
0:23:47,25 --> 0:23:49,834
But he wouldn't listen.


407
0:23:49,834 --> 0:23:52,84
- He wanted Hugo
to marry Ruth.


408
0:23:52,84 --> 0:23:54,5
- No marriage to Ruth,
no money for me.


409
0:23:54,5 --> 0:23:56,584
That's what it boiled down to.


410
0:23:56,584 --> 0:23:58,417
- So, Monsieur Trent,


411
0:23:58,417 --> 0:24:2,334
you had no reason, therefore,
to celebrate.


412
0:24:2,334 --> 0:24:3,584
- None at all.


413
0:24:3,584 --> 0:24:4,75
- It was not you, then,


414
0:24:4,75 --> 0:24:6,459
that opened this bottle
of champagne?


415
0:24:6,459 --> 0:24:8,25
- No.


416
0:24:8,25 --> 0:24:9,709
- Curious.


417
0:24:9,709 --> 0:24:11,584
The bottle of champagne,
it is opened,


418
0:24:11,584 --> 0:24:22,0
and yet the contents
are not consumed.


419
0:24:22,0 --> 0:24:24,375
- Ah, there you are, Poirot.


420
0:24:24,375 --> 0:24:26,917
You got any idea where I can
get hold of this Safra,


421
0:24:26,917 --> 0:24:28,834
some sort of friend
of Mrs. Chevenix?


422
0:24:28,834 --> 0:24:31,84
- Safra's dead.


423
0:24:31,84 --> 0:24:35,42
She's Vanda's spirit guide.


424
0:24:35,42 --> 0:24:37,0
- Ah.


425
0:24:37,0 --> 0:24:38,542
I might as well be off, then.


426
0:24:38,542 --> 0:24:41,125
- You believe there is nothing
to investigate?


427
0:24:41,125 --> 0:24:43,459
- Gervase Chevenix
shot himself.


428
0:24:43,459 --> 0:24:45,167
I'm sure of it.


429
0:24:45,167 --> 0:24:47,459
- In that event,
Chief Inspector, d'accord.


430
0:24:47,459 --> 0:24:49,834
We will return at once
to London.


431
0:24:49,834 --> 0:24:52,625
There are, perhaps,
two questions


432
0:24:52,625 --> 0:24:55,959
that you might be able
to answer for me.


433
0:24:55,959 --> 0:25:1,5
- Oh, yes.


434
0:25:1,5 --> 0:25:3,625
- First question:


435
0:25:3,625 --> 0:25:8,792
was Monsieur Chevenix
right-handed or left-handed?


436
0:25:8,792 --> 0:25:11,42
- What's the other question?


437
0:25:11,42 --> 0:25:12,75
- It is more simple.


438
0:25:12,75 --> 0:25:17,834
If Monsieur Chevenix
shot himself,


439
0:25:17,834 --> 0:25:40,584
what has happened
to the bullet?


440
0:25:40,584 --> 0:25:42,167
- Oh, hello, Miss Chevenix.


441
0:25:42,167 --> 0:25:43,5
- Could I see Mr. Poirot,
please?


442
0:25:43,5 --> 0:25:47,5
- Yes.
Follow me down this way.


443
0:25:47,5 --> 0:25:48,584
Miss Chevenix is here.


444
0:25:48,584 --> 0:25:49,75
- Ah, mademoiselle.


445
0:25:49,75 --> 0:25:51,917
- Mr. Poirot,
I need to see you.


446
0:25:51,917 --> 0:25:56,25
- Please to sit down,
mademoiselle.


447
0:25:56,25 --> 0:25:57,917
- Is it true
that Gervase hired you


448
0:25:57,917 --> 0:26:1,792
to investigate John Lake?


449
0:26:1,792 --> 0:26:3,375
- Oui, mademoiselle.


450
0:26:3,375 --> 0:26:5,167
Monsieur Chevenix believed


451
0:26:5,167 --> 0:26:6,959
that he was the object
of a fraud.


452
0:26:6,959 --> 0:26:9,584
- Well, I've come to tell you
that the case is over.


453
0:26:9,584 --> 0:26:12,42
I don't know
what he offered to pay you,


454
0:26:12,42 --> 0:26:18,417
but I hope
that will cover it.


455
0:26:18,417 --> 0:26:20,42
- Mademoiselle,


456
0:26:20,42 --> 0:26:26,167
the company
of Monsieur John Lake,


457
0:26:26,167 --> 0:26:28,0
what is it called?


458
0:26:28,0 --> 0:26:30,209
- It's Northgate Development.


459
0:26:30,209 --> 0:26:33,292
But I'm telling you, Mr. Poirot,
there is nothing to investigate.


460
0:26:33,292 --> 0:26:37,875
- May I ask, mademoiselle...


461
0:26:37,875 --> 0:26:42,792
Were you close
to your guardian?


462
0:26:42,792 --> 0:26:46,292
I was grateful to Gervase.


463
0:26:46,292 --> 0:26:49,84
And he wasn't just my guardian.


464
0:26:49,84 --> 0:26:50,959
He was actually my uncle.


465
0:26:50,959 --> 0:26:53,209
- But he adopted you.


466
0:26:53,209 --> 0:26:58,292
- I was what is quaintly called
a love child.


467
0:26:58,292 --> 0:27:0,209
My father
was Gervase's younger brother.


468
0:27:0,209 --> 0:27:1,709
He was killed in the war.


469
0:27:1,709 --> 0:27:4,625
And my mother was a typist.


470
0:27:4,625 --> 0:27:6,292
- Ah.


471
0:27:6,292 --> 0:27:8,209
And where is she now?


472
0:27:8,209 --> 0:27:9,75
- I don't know.


473
0:27:9,75 --> 0:27:12,917
When my father died,
she wrote to Gervase.


474
0:27:12,917 --> 0:27:14,625
He couldn't have
any children of his own,


475
0:27:14,625 --> 0:27:15,667
so he adopted me.


476
0:27:15,667 --> 0:27:16,875
- I see.


477
0:27:16,875 --> 0:27:25,84
Please to sit down,
mademoiselle.


478
0:27:25,84 --> 0:27:28,209
Tell me, mademoiselle,


479
0:27:28,209 --> 0:27:34,584
on the night of the death
of Monsieur Chevenix,


480
0:27:34,584 --> 0:27:36,584
where were you at 8:00?


481
0:27:36,584 --> 0:27:38,959
- I was in the house.


482
0:27:38,959 --> 0:27:40,667
- But you went out, I think.
- Did I?


483
0:27:40,667 --> 0:27:42,25
- Oh, yes, there was mud
on your shoes.


484
0:27:42,25 --> 0:27:44,292
I remarked on the fact.


485
0:27:44,292 --> 0:27:46,584
- You don't miss a thing,
do you?


486
0:27:46,584 --> 0:27:47,959
Well, yes.


487
0:27:47,959 --> 0:27:49,834
I went out twice.


488
0:27:49,834 --> 0:27:53,167
At about 6:00, I went to pick
some daisies just by the study.


489
0:27:53,167 --> 0:27:57,209
- And later?


490
0:27:57,209 --> 0:28:0,584
It must have been
just after 8:00,


491
0:28:0,584 --> 0:28:2,42
I realized
I'd dropped my brooch,


492
0:28:2,42 --> 0:28:3,542
and I went back to get it.


493
0:28:3,542 --> 0:28:5,625
- It is as simple as that.


494
0:28:5,625 --> 0:28:8,875
- If you don't believe me,
you can ask Miss Lingard.


495
0:28:8,875 --> 0:28:10,417
- Mademoiselle Lingard?


496
0:28:10,417 --> 0:28:28,292
- She was in the lounge
when I came in.


497
0:28:28,292 --> 0:28:29,459
Mr. Poirot.


498
0:28:29,459 --> 0:28:30,75
- Mademoiselle Lingard.


499
0:28:30,75 --> 0:28:32,542
- Captain Hastings.
- Miss Lingard.


500
0:28:32,542 --> 0:28:34,375
- Ah, you quite startled me.


501
0:28:34,375 --> 0:28:36,334
- Still working on the book,
I see.


502
0:28:36,334 --> 0:28:37,875
- Well, yes.


503
0:28:37,875 --> 0:28:39,584
I was paid
until the end of the month,


504
0:28:39,584 --> 0:28:41,5
and the book's
so nearly finished,


505
0:28:41,5 --> 0:28:43,375
it's a shame to stop now.


506
0:28:43,375 --> 0:28:46,792
- But this is not, I believe,
a fauve painting.


507
0:28:46,792 --> 0:28:49,625
- No, it's later.


508
0:28:49,625 --> 0:28:53,417
But it's
such a beautiful painting,


509
0:28:53,417 --> 0:28:55,25
so sad.


510
0:28:55,25 --> 0:28:57,0
- Yes, indeed.


511
0:28:57,0 --> 0:28:58,834
Mademoiselle Lingard,


512
0:28:58,834 --> 0:29:0,959
I wonder if I might
ask you some questions


513
0:29:0,959 --> 0:29:3,875
concerning the death
of Monsieur Gervase Chevenix.


514
0:29:3,875 --> 0:29:5,667
On the night of his death,


515
0:29:5,667 --> 0:29:7,917
as the study door
was being broken open,


516
0:29:7,917 --> 0:29:10,834
I noticed that you bent down
to retrieve something.


517
0:29:10,834 --> 0:29:14,292
- Oh, yes.


518
0:29:14,292 --> 0:29:16,459
It was this.


519
0:29:16,459 --> 0:29:18,167
- Oh, looks like a bullet.


520
0:29:18,167 --> 0:29:19,75
- That's what I thought.


521
0:29:19,75 --> 0:29:23,584
But in fact,
it's a cuff link.


522
0:29:23,584 --> 0:29:26,334
I believe it belongs
to Mr. Trent.


523
0:29:26,334 --> 0:29:28,417
I was meaning
to give it back to him.


524
0:29:28,417 --> 0:29:30,542
- I wonder what it was doing
outside the study.


525
0:29:30,542 --> 0:29:31,75
- I've no idea.


526
0:29:31,75 --> 0:29:33,292
- If you permit,
I shall return it to him


527
0:29:33,292 --> 0:29:34,5
on your behalf.


528
0:29:34,5 --> 0:29:36,75
- Oh, thank you.


529
0:29:36,75 --> 0:29:40,0
- One final question,
Mademoiselle Lingard.


530
0:29:40,0 --> 0:29:43,125
Ruth Chevenix.


531
0:29:43,125 --> 0:29:44,792
- What about her?


532
0:29:44,792 --> 0:29:46,334
- I understand
that you saw her


533
0:29:46,334 --> 0:29:48,292
just before the body
was discovered.


534
0:29:48,292 --> 0:29:49,625
- Yes.


535
0:29:49,625 --> 0:29:52,75
It was just after we all
heard the shot.


536
0:29:52,75 --> 0:29:54,834
She was with me
in the living room.


537
0:29:54,834 --> 0:29:56,959
- Ah.


538
0:29:56,959 --> 0:30:0,209
It is as I thought.


539
0:30:0,209 --> 0:30:2,584
Merci.


540
0:30:2,584 --> 0:30:6,167
- Well, that seems
to back up Ruth's story.


541
0:30:6,167 --> 0:30:8,0
- Tell me, Hastings,
what was your opinion


542
0:30:8,0 --> 0:30:9,292
of Mademoiselle Ruth?


543
0:30:9,292 --> 0:30:10,917
- Well, I don't know.


544
0:30:10,917 --> 0:30:14,334
I'd like to know why she seemed
so keen to defend John Lake.


545
0:30:14,334 --> 0:30:15,875
- Précisément.


546
0:30:15,875 --> 0:30:18,125
And that is also the question
that exercises


547
0:30:18,125 --> 0:30:25,25
the little gray cells
of Poirot.


548
0:30:25,25 --> 0:30:27,209
- All right, Poirot, you win.


549
0:30:27,209 --> 0:30:29,0
It wasn't suicide.


550
0:30:29,0 --> 0:30:31,917
- From what comes this
change of mind, Chief Inspector?


551
0:30:31,917 --> 0:30:33,334
- Well, it's like you said.


552
0:30:33,334 --> 0:30:35,584
Gervase Chevenix
was right-handed.


553
0:30:35,584 --> 0:30:38,292
But when we found him,
the gun was in his left hand.


554
0:30:38,292 --> 0:30:39,5
- Oui.


555
0:30:39,5 --> 0:30:40,834
- And as for the bullet,


556
0:30:40,834 --> 0:30:43,667
it's vanished into thin air.


557
0:30:43,667 --> 0:30:45,584
- Isn't it in the wall?


558
0:30:45,584 --> 0:30:48,625
- Nowhere.


559
0:30:48,625 --> 0:30:51,84
And here's something


560
0:30:51,84 --> 0:30:54,709
that you ought to see...


561
0:30:54,709 --> 0:30:58,334
The last will and testament
of Gervase Chevenix,


562
0:30:58,334 --> 0:31:1,25
leaving his fortune--
and it's a tidy sum--


563
0:31:1,25 --> 0:31:4,84
to Vanda and Ruth Chevenix.


564
0:31:4,84 --> 0:31:6,459
They split it 50/50.


565
0:31:6,459 --> 0:31:9,834
Oh, and there's a bequest
of £2,000


566
0:31:9,834 --> 0:31:13,417
to Hugo Trent.


567
0:31:13,417 --> 0:31:14,709
- Ah.


568
0:31:14,709 --> 0:31:16,792
So he received his capital
after all.


569
0:31:16,792 --> 0:31:18,125
- Ah, yes.


570
0:31:18,125 --> 0:31:21,84
But there's something else.


571
0:31:21,84 --> 0:31:24,584
We found this
in one of his desk drawers,


572
0:31:24,584 --> 0:31:26,209
unlocked.


573
0:31:26,209 --> 0:31:34,875
Anyone could have seen it.


574
0:31:34,875 --> 0:31:36,5
- A second will.


575
0:31:36,5 --> 0:31:37,709
- Yes,


576
0:31:37,709 --> 0:31:44,875
but unsigned.


577
0:31:44,875 --> 0:31:47,25
- What does it entail?


578
0:31:47,25 --> 0:31:49,792
- It's completely barmy.


579
0:31:49,792 --> 0:31:51,709
Vanda Chevenix gets everything


580
0:31:51,709 --> 0:31:54,917
if Hugo Trent and Ruth Chevenix
don't marry each other.


581
0:31:54,917 --> 0:31:56,959
- I say.


582
0:31:56,959 --> 0:31:58,459
That sounds like
a motive for murder


583
0:31:58,459 --> 0:31:59,584
if ever I heard one.


584
0:31:59,584 --> 0:32:0,625
- Right.


585
0:32:0,625 --> 0:32:3,417
That's what I thought too.


586
0:32:3,417 --> 0:32:5,542
- So you are suggesting
that Monsieur Chevenix


587
0:32:5,542 --> 0:32:8,209
was killed to prevent him
from signing this new will?


588
0:32:8,209 --> 0:32:13,42
- Right.


589
0:32:13,42 --> 0:32:14,917
- It is possible, yes.


590
0:32:14,917 --> 0:32:17,334
- But there's one thing
I'd like to know, Poirot.


591
0:32:17,334 --> 0:32:19,25
- What is that,
Chief Inspector?


592
0:32:19,25 --> 0:32:21,709
- What exactly were you doing
at Hamborough Close?


593
0:32:21,709 --> 0:32:25,334
How did you get mixed up
in all this?


594
0:32:25,334 --> 0:32:26,75
Fraud?


595
0:32:26,75 --> 0:32:40,84
- That is what Monsieur Chevenix
believed.


596
0:32:40,84 --> 0:32:42,209
- Northgate Development.


597
0:32:42,209 --> 0:32:44,292
Not quite what you'd expect,
is it?


598
0:32:44,292 --> 0:32:46,792
- Well, if this place is just
a front, Captain Hastings,


599
0:32:46,792 --> 0:32:52,0
it's exactly what I'd expect.


600
0:32:52,0 --> 0:33:1,709
Yeah, the door's open.


601
0:33:1,709 --> 0:33:5,417
It's very quiet.


602
0:33:5,417 --> 0:33:7,375
There doesn't seem
to be anybody about.


603
0:33:7,375 --> 0:33:9,167
- Place is deserted.


604
0:33:9,167 --> 0:33:12,917
- Must've done a buck.


605
0:33:12,917 --> 0:33:14,959
- I say, Poirot.


606
0:33:14,959 --> 0:33:20,125
Come and look at this.


607
0:33:20,125 --> 0:33:23,84
Pond Street, Harrow.


608
0:33:23,84 --> 0:33:24,792
It's a scale model
of the development.


609
0:33:24,792 --> 0:33:27,917
- Does it not remind you
of something, Hastings?


610
0:33:27,917 --> 0:33:30,334
- Looks a bit like
Hamborough Close.


611
0:33:30,334 --> 0:33:35,917
- It is the work
of the same hand.


612
0:33:35,917 --> 0:33:40,584
Hastings, do you smell smoke?


613
0:33:40,584 --> 0:33:54,5
Yes.


614
0:33:54,5 --> 0:33:55,875
- God, there's someone in there.


615
0:33:55,875 --> 0:33:57,5
Japp!


616
0:33:57,5 --> 0:34:1,75
- What is it?


617
0:34:1,75 --> 0:34:7,792
Blimey.


618
0:34:7,792 --> 0:34:9,625
- It's John Lake.


619
0:34:9,625 --> 0:34:13,25
- Come on, get him outside.


620
0:34:13,25 --> 0:34:14,584
- Oh, sacre bleu.


621
0:34:14,584 --> 0:34:18,292
The fire, it is spreading!


622
0:34:18,292 --> 0:34:19,667
Chief Inspector,


623
0:34:19,667 --> 0:34:25,75
Hastings, follow me!


624
0:34:25,75 --> 0:34:27,792
Careful, Captain Hastings.


625
0:34:27,792 --> 0:34:50,167
- Ugh, I can't see.


626
0:34:50,167 --> 0:35:3,584
Good Lord.


627
0:35:3,584 --> 0:35:6,542
- Mr. Poirot.


628
0:35:6,542 --> 0:35:8,334
I'm sorry.


629
0:35:8,334 --> 0:35:10,42
I've been foolish.


630
0:35:10,42 --> 0:35:12,417
- You wish to tell me
about Northgate Development,


631
0:35:12,417 --> 0:35:13,625
Monsieur Lake?


632
0:35:13,625 --> 0:35:16,5
- Yes.


633
0:35:16,5 --> 0:35:20,0
Yes.


634
0:35:20,0 --> 0:35:22,292
I didn't know what I was doing.


635
0:35:22,292 --> 0:35:24,292
That's the truth of it.


636
0:35:24,292 --> 0:35:28,459
I was out of my depth.


637
0:35:28,459 --> 0:35:32,375
To start with,
I was just the architect.


638
0:35:32,375 --> 0:35:36,125
Then they asked me
if I'd like to be a partner.


639
0:35:36,125 --> 0:35:37,75
I didn't know anything
about business,


640
0:35:37,75 --> 0:35:40,625
but I was flattered.


641
0:35:40,625 --> 0:35:43,125
- And so you helped them
to raise the finance?


642
0:35:43,125 --> 0:35:44,334
- Yes.


643
0:35:44,334 --> 0:35:47,292
- And they disappeared with it,
leaving you to carry the can.


644
0:35:47,292 --> 0:35:49,334
- That's right.


645
0:35:49,334 --> 0:35:53,292
When Gervase called you in,
I was afraid.


646
0:35:53,292 --> 0:35:55,792
I panicked.


647
0:35:55,792 --> 0:35:58,292
I just wanted
to get rid of the evidence.


648
0:35:58,292 --> 0:36:2,375
- So it was you
that started the blaze.


649
0:36:2,375 --> 0:36:4,75
- I set a device,


650
0:36:4,75 --> 0:36:6,375
a timer.


651
0:36:6,375 --> 0:36:13,459
- Which misfired.


652
0:36:13,459 --> 0:36:15,417
- If you--


653
0:36:15,417 --> 0:36:27,875
if you hadn't found me...


654
0:36:27,875 --> 0:36:29,42
- Mr. Poirot.


655
0:36:29,42 --> 0:36:30,25
- Mademoiselle.


656
0:36:30,25 --> 0:36:31,75
- Chief Inspector.


657
0:36:31,75 --> 0:36:34,709
I have to go in.


658
0:36:34,709 --> 0:36:36,459
- I'm sorry, miss,
no visitors.


659
0:36:36,459 --> 0:36:38,625
- But you don't understand.
I must see him.


660
0:36:38,625 --> 0:36:39,667
- It's family only.


661
0:36:39,667 --> 0:36:42,42
Those are doctor's orders.


662
0:36:42,42 --> 0:36:45,75
- I am family, Chief Inspector.


663
0:36:45,75 --> 0:36:49,459
I'm his wife.


664
0:36:49,459 --> 0:36:54,459
John and I were married
a week ago.


665
0:36:54,459 --> 0:36:57,875
Can I go in?


666
0:36:57,875 --> 0:37:6,875
- Your husband awaits you.


667
0:37:6,875 --> 0:37:10,84
- Well, well, well.


668
0:37:10,84 --> 0:37:13,459
- So Ruth
secretly married John.


669
0:37:13,459 --> 0:37:15,834
Well, good luck to her
is all I can say.


670
0:37:15,834 --> 0:37:17,542
- But you also have plans
for the marriage,


671
0:37:17,542 --> 0:37:18,75
Mademoiselle Susan.


672
0:37:18,75 --> 0:37:20,209
- Yes, and from now on,


673
0:37:20,209 --> 0:37:22,167
I'll be helping Hugo
with his business.


674
0:37:22,167 --> 0:37:24,292
- But what brings you here,
Mr. Poirot?


675
0:37:24,292 --> 0:37:25,5
Do you want to place an order?


676
0:37:25,5 --> 0:37:27,209
- Oh, non, non, non.
Non, non, Monsieur Trent.


677
0:37:27,209 --> 0:37:28,375
It is just this.


678
0:37:28,375 --> 0:37:32,25
It belongs, I think, to you?


679
0:37:32,25 --> 0:37:34,209
- Yes.


680
0:37:34,209 --> 0:37:36,209
Yes, it is mine.


681
0:37:36,209 --> 0:37:38,42
Where did you find it?


682
0:37:38,42 --> 0:37:41,0
- Monsieur Trent, on the night
that your uncle died,


683
0:37:41,0 --> 0:37:43,417
did you see Monsieur John Lake?


684
0:37:43,417 --> 0:37:44,584
- No.


685
0:37:44,584 --> 0:37:46,375
No, he was in the library.


686
0:37:46,375 --> 0:37:47,834
- You heard the shot?


687
0:37:47,834 --> 0:37:49,84
- Yes.


688
0:37:49,84 --> 0:37:50,542
Susan heard it too.


689
0:37:50,542 --> 0:37:51,875
- Yes.


690
0:37:51,875 --> 0:37:53,5
I was dashing down the corridor.


691
0:37:53,5 --> 0:37:55,584
I thought it was
a car backfiring.


692
0:37:55,584 --> 0:37:57,667
- But why were you dashing,
Mademoiselle?


693
0:37:57,667 --> 0:37:59,875
- Well, I'd got muddled
with the gongs,


694
0:37:59,875 --> 0:38:1,75
and I was terrified
of being late.


695
0:38:1,75 --> 0:38:4,375
You see, I thought I'd
already heard the first gong.


696
0:38:4,375 --> 0:38:6,209
- Yes, I thought I heard it too.


697
0:38:6,209 --> 0:38:9,334
- Exactly, Hastings.


698
0:38:9,334 --> 0:38:19,75
And yet I, Hercule Poirot,
did not hear.


699
0:38:19,75 --> 0:38:21,5
The case is solved.


700
0:38:21,5 --> 0:38:22,834
- Solved? How?


701
0:38:22,834 --> 0:38:24,84
- Ah, Hastings.


702
0:38:24,84 --> 0:38:26,459
Did you not hear the testimony
of Mademoiselle Cardwell?


703
0:38:26,459 --> 0:38:28,542
And do you not recollect
the bottle of champagne?


704
0:38:28,542 --> 0:38:30,209
- It's gonna take
more than champagne


705
0:38:30,209 --> 0:38:31,542
to solve this case, Poirot.


706
0:38:31,542 --> 0:38:33,875
What about the bullet,
for instance?


707
0:38:33,875 --> 0:38:36,459
- You shall have the bullet,
Chief Inspector.


708
0:38:36,459 --> 0:38:42,667
Soon you shall have everything.


709
0:38:42,667 --> 0:38:44,84
I have asked you all
to come here


710
0:38:44,84 --> 0:38:45,875
so that you might learn
the true facts


711
0:38:45,875 --> 0:38:48,709
concerning the death
of Monsieur Gervase Chevenix.


712
0:38:48,709 --> 0:38:50,625
- He is not dead.


713
0:38:50,625 --> 0:38:52,542
- Madame?


714
0:38:52,542 --> 0:38:56,667
- He is on a different
spiritual plane, that's all.


715
0:38:56,667 --> 0:38:59,42
- There, there.


716
0:38:59,42 --> 0:39:2,959
- First, we must accept the fact
that this was not suicide.


717
0:39:2,959 --> 0:39:7,292
Monsieur Chevenix
did not kill himself, non.


718
0:39:7,292 --> 0:39:9,209
He was killed


719
0:39:9,209 --> 0:39:12,542
and by someone
in this very room.


720
0:39:12,542 --> 0:39:14,167
- It's not possible!


721
0:39:14,167 --> 0:39:16,709
- There was no one in here
when we broke in.


722
0:39:16,709 --> 0:39:18,459
And the door was locked
from the inside.


723
0:39:18,459 --> 0:39:20,167
Gervase had the key.


724
0:39:20,167 --> 0:39:21,917
And the windows were fastened.


725
0:39:21,917 --> 0:39:24,209
- Anyway, no one would have
wanted to kill him.


726
0:39:24,209 --> 0:39:26,167
- Indeed?


727
0:39:26,167 --> 0:39:28,25
And yet it was you,
Mademoiselle Cardwell,


728
0:39:28,25 --> 0:39:30,75
you yourself who told to me
that you hated him


729
0:39:30,75 --> 0:39:33,334
and that you would let nothing
stand in between you


730
0:39:33,334 --> 0:39:34,75
and Monsieur Hugo Trent.


731
0:39:34,75 --> 0:39:36,459
- That's not fair.


732
0:39:36,459 --> 0:39:38,84
- And you, Monsieur Trent?


733
0:39:38,84 --> 0:39:41,459
You were desperate
to see your business succeed.


734
0:39:41,459 --> 0:39:43,959
- It's true.
I--I needed money.


735
0:39:43,959 --> 0:39:46,875
- Money which you now have,
Monsieur,


736
0:39:46,875 --> 0:39:48,792
money which you would
never have received


737
0:39:48,792 --> 0:39:57,625
without the death of your uncle.


738
0:39:57,625 --> 0:40:0,292
You also, Monsieur Lake.


739
0:40:0,292 --> 0:40:2,42
Oh, yes.


740
0:40:2,42 --> 0:40:5,709
You are afraid from the moment
you set eyes on Poirot.


741
0:40:5,709 --> 0:40:8,167
You have not only
committed arson.


742
0:40:8,167 --> 0:40:10,25
You also persuaded
Monsieur Chevenix


743
0:40:10,25 --> 0:40:13,167
to part with a sum
of £10,000.


744
0:40:13,167 --> 0:40:15,84
- That wasn't my fault.


745
0:40:15,84 --> 0:40:16,917
- Non?


746
0:40:16,917 --> 0:40:21,0
I think Monsieur Chevenix
might have disagreed.


747
0:40:21,0 --> 0:40:23,875
And you also.


748
0:40:23,875 --> 0:40:26,417
You had every good reason
to wish your guardian dead,


749
0:40:26,417 --> 0:40:27,625
Madame Lake.


750
0:40:27,625 --> 0:40:30,42
- I had no reason at all.


751
0:40:30,42 --> 0:40:31,292
And anyway,
even if it was murder,


752
0:40:31,292 --> 0:40:32,417
it couldn't have been me.


753
0:40:32,417 --> 0:40:33,5
- Non?


754
0:40:33,5 --> 0:40:34,542
- I told you, Mr. Poirot.


755
0:40:34,542 --> 0:40:36,25
Miss Ruth
was in the living room with me


756
0:40:36,25 --> 0:40:37,875
when Mr. Chevenix was killed.


757
0:40:37,875 --> 0:40:40,125
- At what time was that,
Mademoiselle Lingard?


758
0:40:40,125 --> 0:40:42,0
And at what time
did Mr. Chevenix die?


759
0:40:42,0 --> 0:40:43,75
- We know what time he died.


760
0:40:43,75 --> 0:40:44,834
We heard the shot.


761
0:40:44,834 --> 0:40:47,42
- Non, non, non.


762
0:40:47,42 --> 0:40:49,292
You were deceived.


763
0:40:49,292 --> 0:40:54,625
At 8:00, Monsieur Chevenix
was indeed in his study


764
0:40:54,625 --> 0:40:57,125
working at his desk.


765
0:40:57,125 --> 0:41:0,625
But he was not alone
in the room.


766
0:41:0,625 --> 0:41:4,75
He turned.


767
0:41:4,75 --> 0:41:7,542
- The gun was silenced.


768
0:41:7,542 --> 0:41:12,167
No one heard the shot.


769
0:41:12,167 --> 0:41:14,75
So...


770
0:41:14,75 --> 0:41:21,625
let us now consider the language
of the bullet.


771
0:41:21,625 --> 0:41:26,375
Hastings, please to sit.


772
0:41:26,375 --> 0:41:28,209
The gun was discovered


773
0:41:28,209 --> 0:41:31,75
in the left hand
of Monsieur Chevenix.


774
0:41:31,75 --> 0:41:34,542
- Good. My card.


775
0:41:34,542 --> 0:41:36,25
- And yet
from our very first meeting,


776
0:41:36,25 --> 0:41:39,667
I knew that Monsieur Chevenix
was right-handed.


777
0:41:39,667 --> 0:41:43,625
But if the bullet
was fired from behind...


778
0:41:43,625 --> 0:41:45,834
Hastings?


779
0:41:45,834 --> 0:41:48,0
Comme ça,


780
0:41:48,0 --> 0:41:49,625
how could it possibly
hit the mirror,


781
0:41:49,625 --> 0:41:51,542
which is to the side?


782
0:41:51,542 --> 0:41:52,834
- It couldn't have.


783
0:41:52,834 --> 0:41:53,959
- Non.


784
0:41:53,959 --> 0:41:55,292
So now let us suppose


785
0:41:55,292 --> 0:41:57,84
that the door to the study
was open.


786
0:41:57,84 --> 0:42:4,292
If you please, Monsieur Snell.


787
0:42:4,292 --> 0:42:6,167
Thank you.


788
0:42:6,167 --> 0:42:8,709
And again, Hastings?


789
0:42:8,709 --> 0:42:12,709
The gun comme ça.


790
0:42:12,709 --> 0:42:15,667
- It would've hit the gong.


791
0:42:15,667 --> 0:42:18,42
So that was the gong I heard.


792
0:42:18,42 --> 0:42:20,209
- Well, then how did the mirror
get broken?


793
0:42:20,209 --> 0:42:23,834
- The murderer wanted to make
an appearance of suicide.


794
0:42:23,834 --> 0:42:26,584
But what if the sound
of the gong has been heard?


795
0:42:26,584 --> 0:42:28,834
Then it would be known
that the door to the study


796
0:42:28,834 --> 0:42:30,917
was open and not closed.


797
0:42:30,917 --> 0:42:34,584
Quickly, the door is closed


798
0:42:34,584 --> 0:42:37,42
and locked.


799
0:42:37,42 --> 0:42:38,84
The gun is placed


800
0:42:38,84 --> 0:42:40,959
into the left hand
of the dead man.


801
0:42:40,959 --> 0:42:43,542
The key goes into the pocket.


802
0:42:43,542 --> 0:42:47,125
The suicide note of one word
is easily forged


803
0:42:47,125 --> 0:42:54,25
and the mirror
deliberately smashed.


804
0:42:54,25 --> 0:42:55,75
When I first came here,


805
0:42:55,75 --> 0:42:57,75
you will remember,
Chief Inspector,


806
0:42:57,75 --> 0:43:0,125
that I discovered a fragment
of the looking glass


807
0:43:0,125 --> 0:43:2,334
attached to this brass ornament,


808
0:43:2,334 --> 0:43:6,209
the base of which
was also slightly damaged.


809
0:43:6,209 --> 0:43:9,334
It was then
that I saw the light.


810
0:43:9,334 --> 0:43:11,375
- So what happened then?


811
0:43:11,375 --> 0:43:13,375
How did the killer leave?


812
0:43:13,375 --> 0:43:16,625
- The killer left
through the window,


813
0:43:16,625 --> 0:43:21,25
cleverly closing the latch
from the outside.


814
0:43:21,25 --> 0:43:22,584
Voilà.


815
0:43:22,584 --> 0:43:23,959
- So who was it?


816
0:43:23,959 --> 0:43:29,125
Who was the murderer?


817
0:43:29,125 --> 0:43:34,209
- Who entered the house
that night from the garden?


818
0:43:34,209 --> 0:43:36,959
And who would have lost
everything


819
0:43:36,959 --> 0:43:41,542
if Monsieur Chevenix had lived
to sign his new will?


820
0:43:41,542 --> 0:43:43,209
- What new will?


821
0:43:43,209 --> 0:43:45,709
- The will that disinherited you
completely


822
0:43:45,709 --> 0:43:48,292
if you did not marry
Monsieur Hugo Trent.


823
0:43:48,292 --> 0:43:50,459
But it was too late,
Madame Lake,


824
0:43:50,459 --> 0:43:52,292
for you were already married.


825
0:43:52,292 --> 0:43:53,584
- No!


826
0:43:53,584 --> 0:43:54,625
You're wrong!


827
0:43:54,625 --> 0:43:55,917
Stop him!


828
0:43:55,917 --> 0:43:57,875
- Non, monsieur,
Poirot is never wrong.


829
0:43:57,875 --> 0:43:59,25
The will,
it was left in this room.


830
0:43:59,25 --> 0:44:0,667
You could have seen it
at any time.


831
0:44:0,667 --> 0:44:2,792
But it was too late to undo
what you had already done.


832
0:44:2,792 --> 0:44:4,0
Oh, yes, you were married


833
0:44:4,0 --> 0:44:5,917
but to the man
your guardian most disliked.


834
0:44:5,917 --> 0:44:7,5
- I was going to tell him.


835
0:44:7,5 --> 0:44:8,959
I hated lying.


836
0:44:8,959 --> 0:44:10,584
I'd planned to tell him
that very night.


837
0:44:10,584 --> 0:44:12,459
- Non, not to tell him, madame--
to kill him.


838
0:44:12,459 --> 0:44:13,875
- You're wrong!


839
0:44:13,875 --> 0:44:15,584
- There's not a word of truth
in your story.


840
0:44:15,584 --> 0:44:19,417
It's a lie from start to finish.


841
0:44:19,417 --> 0:44:33,584
- That is for a jury to decide.


842
0:44:33,584 --> 0:44:35,625
- Are you sure you're gonna
be all right, Vanda?


843
0:44:35,625 --> 0:44:37,84
- Yes, yes.


844
0:44:37,84 --> 0:44:39,334
Good night, Hugo.


845
0:44:39,334 --> 0:44:48,459
- Good night,
Mrs. Chevenix.


846
0:44:48,459 --> 0:44:50,667
Poor Ruth.


847
0:44:50,667 --> 0:45:5,209
I still don't believe it.


848
0:45:5,209 --> 0:45:29,375
- I hope you know
what you're doing, Poirot.


849
0:45:29,375 --> 0:45:31,542
- Vanda.


850
0:45:31,542 --> 0:45:40,375
Wake up.


851
0:45:40,375 --> 0:45:43,375
- Who is it?


852
0:45:43,375 --> 0:45:47,875
- It's Safra, Vanda.


853
0:45:47,875 --> 0:46:15,334
Come downstairs.


854
0:46:15,334 --> 0:46:20,42
It was you, Vanda.


855
0:46:20,42 --> 0:46:22,25
You killed him.


856
0:46:22,25 --> 0:46:23,459
- No.


857
0:46:23,459 --> 0:46:31,84
- You know it was.
You killed Gervase.


858
0:46:31,84 --> 0:46:34,792
Come down.


859
0:46:34,792 --> 0:46:43,959
Come down!


860
0:46:43,959 --> 0:46:46,5
You killed him


861
0:46:46,5 --> 0:46:48,917
because you hated him.


862
0:46:48,917 --> 0:46:53,209
Now you must make amends!


863
0:46:53,209 --> 0:46:54,834
- I didn't.


864
0:46:54,834 --> 0:46:57,417
- What have you hidden


865
0:46:57,417 --> 0:47:1,209
in your locket, Vanda?


866
0:47:1,209 --> 0:47:5,834
The bullet
that killed your husband!


867
0:47:5,834 --> 0:47:12,209
- No.


868
0:47:12,209 --> 0:47:20,5
- You must write a note
admitting it!


869
0:47:20,5 --> 0:47:24,209
And then...


870
0:47:24,209 --> 0:47:32,125
- No.


871
0:47:32,125 --> 0:47:37,959
- It is enough.


872
0:47:37,959 --> 0:47:39,5
I knew that you would
try something,


873
0:47:39,5 --> 0:47:40,834
Mademoiselle Lingard.


874
0:47:40,834 --> 0:47:42,834
But this?


875
0:47:42,834 --> 0:47:44,5
- It's diabolical.


876
0:47:44,5 --> 0:47:47,25
- I had to save her.


877
0:47:47,25 --> 0:47:50,125
I had to save Ruth.


878
0:47:50,125 --> 0:47:52,375
- Yes, I know.


879
0:47:52,375 --> 0:47:53,75
And in order to save her,


880
0:47:53,75 --> 0:47:57,959
you killed
Monsieur Gervase Chevenix.


881
0:47:57,959 --> 0:47:59,417
And you are the real mother


882
0:47:59,417 --> 0:48:1,584
of Ruth Chevenix,
are you not?


883
0:48:1,584 --> 0:48:3,5
The typist
with whom the brother


884
0:48:3,5 --> 0:48:6,375
of Monsieur Gervase Chevenix
fell in love.


885
0:48:6,375 --> 0:48:8,292
- How did you know?


886
0:48:8,292 --> 0:48:11,292
- There could be
no other explanation.


887
0:48:11,292 --> 0:48:15,0
And in the museum,
that was when I saw.


888
0:48:15,0 --> 0:48:19,375
- But it's
such a beautiful painting,


889
0:48:19,375 --> 0:48:23,834
so sad.


890
0:48:23,834 --> 0:48:28,84
- It was a painting of a mother
who loses her child.


891
0:48:28,84 --> 0:48:30,375
And it was then that I saw


892
0:48:30,375 --> 0:48:32,542
that you were also a mother


893
0:48:32,542 --> 0:48:35,292
who had lost her child.


894
0:48:35,292 --> 0:48:37,125
And you came to this house,
I think,


895
0:48:37,125 --> 0:48:39,25
to check up on the daughter
that you had lost,


896
0:48:39,25 --> 0:48:42,917
so you took up the position
of a researcher.


897
0:48:42,917 --> 0:48:45,459
- Yes.


898
0:48:45,459 --> 0:48:47,417
- And while you were working,


899
0:48:47,417 --> 0:48:51,209
you stumbled
across the new will.


900
0:48:51,209 --> 0:48:55,42
- He was going to ruin her life
with his...


901
0:48:55,42 --> 0:48:58,625
pride and his snobbery.


902
0:48:58,625 --> 0:49:3,334
- And so you decided to take
matters into your own hand.


903
0:49:3,334 --> 0:49:5,25
You killed
Monsieur Gervase Chevenix


904
0:49:5,25 --> 0:49:8,209
exactly as I described.


905
0:49:8,209 --> 0:49:10,917
You then left the study,


906
0:49:10,917 --> 0:49:20,417
taking care to leave
no footprints in the soil.


907
0:49:20,417 --> 0:49:22,417
But unknown to you,


908
0:49:22,417 --> 0:49:24,75
a few moments later,
Ruth Chevenix appeared


909
0:49:24,75 --> 0:49:31,167
in search of a brooch
which she had lost.


910
0:49:31,167 --> 0:49:32,834
She found it


911
0:49:32,834 --> 0:49:37,42
but, in doing so,
left behind her own footprints.


912
0:49:37,42 --> 0:49:38,834
It was then necessary
to continue


913
0:49:38,834 --> 0:49:40,417
the illusion of suicide


914
0:49:40,417 --> 0:49:43,334
and to establish
a false time of death.


915
0:49:43,334 --> 0:49:46,125
It was very clever,
that idea of yours


916
0:49:46,125 --> 0:49:50,417
to imitate a gun.


917
0:49:50,417 --> 0:49:53,417
You then went
into the living room


918
0:49:53,417 --> 0:49:59,875
and were there
when Ruth Chevenix came in.


919
0:49:59,875 --> 0:50:2,875
- Good evening, Miss Ruth.


920
0:50:2,875 --> 0:50:5,334
- Oh, good evening,
Miss Lingard.


921
0:50:5,334 --> 0:50:7,959
- I found it most significant
that you did not tell to me


922
0:50:7,959 --> 0:50:9,709
that Ruth Chevenix
entered the living room


923
0:50:9,709 --> 0:50:11,292
from the garden.


924
0:50:11,292 --> 0:50:13,917
- Well, how could I?


925
0:50:13,917 --> 0:50:18,292
It would have incriminated her.


926
0:50:18,292 --> 0:50:21,292
- And there was now
but one thing left to do:


927
0:50:21,292 --> 0:50:23,5
the bullet.


928
0:50:23,5 --> 0:50:25,84
- I found it by the gong


929
0:50:25,84 --> 0:50:28,917
when you were
breaking open the door.


930
0:50:28,917 --> 0:50:32,709
I wanted to drop it
inside the study,


931
0:50:32,709 --> 0:50:35,75
but I didn't get the chance.


932
0:50:35,75 --> 0:50:39,959
- And the cuff link
of Monsieur Trent?


933
0:50:39,959 --> 0:50:42,459
- I stole that from his room.


934
0:50:42,459 --> 0:50:46,25
I knew you'd seen me
picking up the bullet,


935
0:50:46,25 --> 0:50:48,5
so I had to have
something to show you.


936
0:50:48,5 --> 0:50:50,42
- Yes.


937
0:50:50,42 --> 0:50:57,209
You almost succeeded
in confusing Poirot.


938
0:50:57,209 --> 0:51:1,0
Chief Inspector.


939
0:51:1,0 --> 0:51:7,542
- I think you'd better come
along with me, Miss Lingard.


940
0:51:7,542 --> 0:51:10,584
Mr. Poirot.


941
0:51:10,584 --> 0:51:14,0
I don't want Ruth to see me.


942
0:51:14,0 --> 0:51:17,0
I don't care
what happens to me,


943
0:51:17,0 --> 0:51:20,917
but please...


944
0:51:20,917 --> 0:51:29,417
Don't let her see me.


945
0:51:29,417 --> 0:51:32,584
- You have my word.


946
0:51:32,584 --> 0:53:32,584
- Thank you.
