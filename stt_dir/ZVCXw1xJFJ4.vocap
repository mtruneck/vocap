###17 The following program is brought to you in living colour on NBC.
###41 Lieutenant Spock. Status report!
###43 I estimate it will fire in 23.4 seconds.
###46 Engineering, all power to the aft shields.
###48 There is none to give, is there?
###50 Evasive manoeuvres, Mr Tyler!
###51 The helm is not responding, sir!
###53 Captain Pike, we are on emergency power. Warp drive going critical.
###56 Thank you, Number One!
###57 10 seconds.
###58 All hands, this is the captain! Prepare for saucer separation.
###62 I repeat, stand by to...
###97 Space, the final frontier.
###100 These are the new voyages of the Starship Enterprise
###104 Its five-year mission, to explore strange new worlds.
###108 To seek out new life and new civilizations.
###111 To boldly go where no man has gone before.
###242 [Kirk] The Enterprise
###243 [Spock] Captain Kirk, I do not make this request lightly,
###246 but it is urgent that you alter course for gateway immediately.
###249 Mr Spock, I'm afraid, I don't know what good a starship can do.
###254 I'm sure the scientists, there at project "Timepiece," can handle this situation.
###257 I knew this wouldn't work.
###258 Captain, as I'm sure Lt Uhura has told you,
###261 my request has priority one authorization.
###263 You can confirm this with Starfleet Command, but you must comply.
###267 Spock out.
###269 Well. Priority one it is!
###272 Lt Uhura, sound Red Alert.
###274 Helm, set course for "Gateway".
###276 Aye, sir. Coming to course zero one one mark three zero.
###279 Commander, do you foresee any difficulty in
###281 navigating the time waves, within the Gateway system?
###285 Mr DeSalle should have no difficulty, Captain.
###288 Very good, Commander Kargh.
###289 Helm, you heard our first Officer. Maximum warp!
###292 Aye, sir.
###322 Welcome, Captain!
###323 Dr MacGregor, Thank you.
###324 This is my chief medical officer, Dr Leonard McCoy
###326 My 1st Officer, Commander Kargh.
###328 How do you do?
###332 This is Commander Spock.
###333 Commander? There are no Vulcans in Starfleet.
###339 Captain, as you know, project "Timepiece" was established as a permanent research facility
###345 shortly after your discovery of the artefact on this planet.
###348 Of course, Doctor. Your reputation does precede you.
###350 Then I hope you will take us seriously when we tell you,
###355 that the natural course of time has been altered.
###365 These figures, represent the flow of time.
###367 The natural flow of time, yes.
###369 Here are the readings I took only a few hours ago.
###372 This is at least a magnitude ten variation.
###374 10.2! From that point on, history is no longer correct.
###378 And if that's not enough, the same anti-protons signature
###381 shows up again, only a few months ago.
###383 Corresponding to our battle with the planet devouring weapon.
###386 commonly known as the doomsday machine.
###389 Our battle?
###390 Captain, until this shift in time,
###393 Mr Spock was your first Officer, aboard the Enterprise.
###399 Enterprise?
###401 There's no ship named...
###402 According to my research, you and the crew of the Farragut,
###405 were assigned many of the same missions,
###406 had many of the same experiences,
###409 shared many of the same crises as the crew of the Enterprise.
###412 Parallel time-line development is not without president.
###415 Does that includes letting Matt Decker die senselessly in a shuttlecraft?
###418 Yes, including even that.
###421 That and your discovery of this planet and the vortex.
###425 Captain, you loaned Cmdr Spock to us as a research consultant.
###428 He was protected from the changes in the time-line.
###431 As are we all, here on "Gateway".
###433 Cmdr Spock, the Farragut has done battle with several of these killers
###437 since this "doomsday war" began.
###438 And Matt Decker was killed flying a shuttlecraft into the doomsday weapon.
###442 When you detonated the Constellation inside that same device
###445 Dr MacGregor instruments registered a smaller,
###448 yet otherwise identical anti-proton surge.
###451 So what you're really saying is, you expect us to go back in time,
###455 and change history so things go your way?
###458 Well, this is our life! Our history.
###461 How do we know your "correct" history is the right one?
###464 The best one?
###465 Because Jim here, in your time-line, billions of people are dead!
###472 As you pointed out, Doctor,
###474 Vulcan and dozens of other worlds, have been destroyed,
###476 in the 14 years since the first of these machines appeared.
###480 In my time-line, those worlds are still there.
###482 Vibrant, thriving, filled with life.
###486 So, that's what we're supposed to do?
###487 Use the vortex to travel back in time,
###490 to 2254 and stop these things, before they can start a war?
###494 Without the proper preparation, you would be annihilated
###497 along with everything else in your path.
###499 First, we must gather more information.
###502 And exactly how do we do that?
###507 Sorry, I asked.
###511 It is our hope that by following this smaller, more recent pulse,
###514 from your encounter with the doomsday weapon,
###516 we might get some sense as to how these time- deviations occur and how we might counter them.
###521 The pulse leads to Earth in the 1960s.
###524 A most tumultuous time in your history.
###526 So much so, in fact, that I am having difficulty getting an accurate reading.
###530 Commander Spock, I have located the pulse.
###533 The energy signature proceeds through time until, ...there.
###538 This must be the focal point.
###539 The temporal foci should bring us within immediate proximity of whatever
###542 is causing the disturbance.
###544 Our research indicates that
###545 you will automatically return when your mission is a success.
###549 Donâ€™t ask me how the Guardian knows.
###552 Five years to go!
###555 Four!
###557 This was easier with my veins full of cordrazine.
###559 Three.
###561 Two.
###562 Now, Captain.
###578 Commander, I thought you said we were heading for the 1960s?
###583 This looks more like, the end of the century.
###587 The beginning, actually!
###588 The readings indicate we have successfully travelled to 2006,
###592 where the anti-proton readings are the strongest.
###594 well done, Spock. Now what?
###597 The signal emanates from that direction.
###600 And what do you suggest we do? Knock?
###608 Yes?
###609 Good afternoon, Miss...
###611 Oh, my...
###615 It's you!
###626 My name is Jim Kirk. We were hoping...
###628 Of course!
###631 Captain Kirk.
###633 Won't you come in, please?
###644 My name is Veronica.
###647 I'm so delighted that you've finally made it.
###650 Ma'am.... Veronica, you were expecting us?
###654 Well, I must admit, I had my doubts.
###658 I've been waiting a long time. Please, sit down.
###674 He always said you'd show up. Sooner or later.
###678 He made this tape for you.
###690 Yes, it works, it works! Just sit down!
###698 Hello there.
###700 Commodore Decker.
###703 Yes.
###705 He made this two years ago.
###707 He died 8 months later.
###710 Commodore Matthew Decker.
###712 This is my report.
###716 If you watching this tape, it means someone from Starfleet, has come looking for me.
###723 I betting it's Jim Kirk.
###726 But, whoever it is,
###729 I'm sorry I missed seeing you.
###733 Now first of all: Please, don't worry.
###736 I did fine.
###738 Thanks to Veronica.
###740 You know that I commandeered a shuttlecraft from the Farragut.
###744 And after setting a course down the maul of that...
###751 Planet-killer.
###753 I locked the autopilot, in case I
###757 lost my nerve.
###759 One minute, I was staring into the face of the devil incarnate.
###767 And the next I'm...
###770 flat on the floor,
###772 of the shuttlecraft.
###777 Drifting in space. I must have blacked out.
###781 The thing was gone.
###783 The spaceships were gone.
###786 The radio was silent.
###790 All I could do was set a course for Earth.
###793 But when I got here...
###796 I discovered, I was stuck in the past.
###800 I was in pretty bad shape.
###804 That was when Veronica found me.
###807 And nursed me back to health, as it were.
###810 helped me to find my place,
###813 make a home, here in the 20th century.
###817 Well, 21st now I guess.
###820 How many men can say that they have seen three centuries?
###826 I suppose I should apologize to Admiral Leslie,
###830 for not trying harder to get back where I started,
###834 But,... you have met Veronica.
###841 And now, it seems the years have finally caught up with me.
###846 So, this is my final report.
###851 Decker, out.
###860 But this does not explain the tricorder readings.
###863 Veronica, did Matt leave anything else?
###867 You might say that. Yes.
###884 Does this explain your tricorder readings?
###886 Yes, Captain. The shuttlecraft, which disappeared along with Commodore Decker.
###890 If the micro-tapes are still intact,
###892 Check it out, Spock.
###897 Matt wanted me to give this to you.
###918 Welcome back!
###919 Since you're here, I assume...
###922 Fascinating. Commodore Decker's sensor data would indicate
###926 that the weapon's conversion drive emits chronitons.
###928 Chronitons?
###929 A quantum particle of time.
###932 Concentrations of chronitons can cause anomalous behaviour in the local time flow.
###936 The Klingon Empire studied the use of chronitons.
###939 They were highly unstable.
###942 Dr MacGregor, I noticed the Enterprise
###944 was mentioned several times throughout your logs.
###945 Oh Yes, Captain. The Enterprise seems to have a knack for
###948 being at the centre of things.
###951 Enterprise.
###953 Fascinating.
###956 [Computer] Working...
###957 The Enterprise was the first ship, to encounter the planet killer.
###959 Yes, Captain.
###960 And it was destroyed almost immediately.
###962 Also true, Doctor.
###964 In your time-line, not in mine.
###966 Then the Enterprise is the key
###969 Was it not supposed to be there, so that its crew would survive?
###971 Or perhaps it is the planet killer, which was in the wrong place.
###975 The wrong time, Mr Kargh.
###977 Do you mean that thing came from the future?
###979 Yes, Doctor.
###980 It arrived in your time where there was no power great enough to stop it.
###984 And it began burning worlds to fuel its anti-proton engine.
###990 The "Doomsday War". Which was never supposed to happened.
###996 Mr Kargh, you said chronitons were unstable.
###998 Yes, sir.
###1000 Could that be what happened, then? When we detonated the Constellation,
###1003 could we have somehow of caused a dangerous chroniton-burst?
###1006 And a smaller reaction from the shuttlecraft could have triggered
###1009 the chronitons to send Commodore Decker back in time.
###1011 Commander Spock
###1013 Could we somehow use that to our advantage?
###1015 Cause a reaction that would send this thing back to its own time?
###1018 No, Captain.
###1019 One starship would not be able to generate
###1021 a reaction of sufficient magnitude.
###1024 Understood.
###1026 And two?
###1027 Two ships, would have a better chance.
###1030 Jim, what are you thinking? We don't have two ships.
###1035 Yes, we do, Bones!
###1040 We have the Enterprise.
###1041 The Enterprise is in the past.
###1044 Time-travel, Captain?
###1046 We know exactly where and when the Enterprise will
###1048 encounter the first doomsday machine. If we could be there at the same time...
###1052 Captain, the slingshot effect is not precise.
###1055 We could emerge hours or weeks from our target.
###1061 That may not be necessary.
###1073 Shuttlecraft McAuliffe. You have been cleared for restricted airspace.
###1076 Continue on this heading until instructed to land.
###1079 Affirmative. McAuliffe out.
###1082 If this area wasn't so heavily shielded we would...
###1084 We would have used the transporter.
###1086 Where would be the fun of it?
###1129 Professor Daniels discovered this about eight months ago.
###1132 A natural dam burst downstream and all of this was exposed.
###1136 The Federation pronounced it off-limits
###1138 and certainly we all had clearance level Alpha.
###1140 No kidding.
###1141 I'm trying to figure out what it's for.
###1143 Colonization, perhaps.
###1144 - Or invasion. - Or research or espionage
###1147 or purely voyeurism. The "why" has been our biggest question.
###1152 You have studied it, of course.
###1154 Not as much as we'd like.
###1156 To tell you the truth, we are a little afraid of it.
###1159 That is wise.
###1161 If you intend to use this, to take the Farragut back in time,
###1165 my primary concern is whether or not it will operate, once it's cut loose and towed into space.
###1170 It's my thought too, but you might have to use your tractor beam, to control...
###1173 No, we won't.
###1176 Mr DeSalle?
###1177 Well, sir,
###1178 I think I can fly Farragut
###1180 straight into this thing.
###1183 What? You mean down here?
###1185 You have the precise dimensions, right?
###1187 Well, of course.
###1188 There's got to be less than a 100 feet clearance behind there.
###1191 If we're wrong about the way this thing works...
###1193 Yes, we'll wind up as cave paintings. I know.
###1196 Maybe, a test using a shuttlecraft?
###1199 [Communicator rings] Kirk, here.
###1201 Captain, long range sensors have picked up a doomsday-machine.
###1204 Heading and distance?
###1206 Sir, it's on a direct course to planet "Gateway"
###1209 Here?
###1210 They have been known to track the Warp signatures of starships, for several hundred light years.
###1215 They followed us.
###1217 Estimates put it in firing range in two hours!
###1219 Keep me posted, Lieutenant. Kirk out.
###1222 Well that's, that. We don't have time for a test!
###1225 Mr DeSalle, a starship is a creature of space.
###1228 It's not meant to be flown in the atmosphere and certainly not at the velocities we're discussing here.
###1233 Yes, sir.
###1235 But I think I can do this.
###1238 Kirk to Farragut.
###1239 Rand here, Captain.
###1241 Lt, notify the hangar deck
###1244 and prepare the crew for collision.
###1245 - Sir? - You heard me, Rand.
###1247 Captain, I know Chris Pike.
###1249 He will not be easy to convince.
###1251 Commander?
###1253 Open your mind, Jim.
###1256 Our minds are merging.
###1258 My thoughts, to your thoughts.
###1260 This one memory - I share with you.
###1266 Talos.
###1268 Spock, what are you doing to him?
###1279 Thank you.
###1280 Spock.
###1284 Jim, are you okay?
###1286 I'm fine, Bones, fine.
###1289 Right now we've got to get Mr DeSalle back in the driver's seat.
###1292 - Spock, you will remain here. - Agreed, Captain.
###1294 Youâ€™re not really going to do this?
###1296 Well, considering our options, doctor, we don't have a choice.
###1299 It's insane, we know nothing about this device.
###1304 I can transmit the specifications from my office.
###1307 But someone will have to stay to activate it.
###1309 I do have some experience in that regard.
###1320 [Intercom] All decks, this is the captain speaking.
###1323 You all know what we're about to do.
###1325 Youâ€™re aware of what's at stake.
###1327 No matter what happens, I want you all to know,
###1330 that there's no other crew, I'd rather serve with.
###1334 On any vessel.
###1336 Kirk out.
###1337 Status report, Mr Scott?
###1339 Engineering ready as always, Captain.
###1341 DeSalle?
###1341 Helm standing by.
###1342 Rand?
###1343 Navigation ready, sir.
###1344 Mr Kargh?
###1345 Ship's systems show green, Captain.
###1346 Structural and aerodynamic force fields at maximum.
###1349 Lt Uhura?
###1350 All decks report ready, sir. Telemetry output established with the Vulcan's tricorder.
###1354 Opinion, Doctor?
###1356 I think you're a damn fool.
###1357 And that guy with the ears is even worse.
###1360 I'll take that as a "yes," then Bones.
###1362 Mr DeSalle, Red Alert. Take us in.
###1366 Aye, sir.
###1376 Lt Uhura, open a channel to the surface.
###1378 Aye, sir.
###1379 Cmdr Spock, our nose is pointed towards the barn!
###1382 I suggest you open the door.
###1384 Very well, Captain.
###1390 What are you?
###1391 A question!
###1393 Gateway, I wish to...
###1395 Since before your sun burned hot in space,
###1398 and before your race was born
###1400 I have awaited, a question.
###1408 Range to go: 50 kilometres.
###1409 Come on, Spock.
###1415 Gateway, I wish to view the history of the planet Earth!
###1419 Now, DeSalle.
###1444 Hold your positions, everyone.
###1448 Lt Uhura, status report.
###1449 All decks report ready, Captain.
###1451 No injuries or casualties, sir.
###1453 Mr Rand?
###1454 All astro-navigation landmarks, confirmed.
###1457 We are 14 years in the past, Captain. The year 2254.
###1460 Well-done, Mr DeSalle. Well-done.
###1462 Sir.
###1467 The Enterprise.
###1479 Scanning.
###1482 Confirmed. Registry NCC-1701. Constitution class.
###1487 And in a hurry to get wherever it's going.
###1489 Hail them, Lieutenant.
###1490 Hailing frequencies open.
###1492 This is Captain James T. Kirk of the USS Farragut, calling the Enterprise.
###1497 This is the U.S.S. Enterprise, Capt Christopher Pike, commanding.
###1501 And Steve Garrovick is Captain of the Farragut.
###1504 So who the devil are you?
###1506 That's going to be, somewhat difficult to explain.
###1509 But it's absolutely vital that you listen to what I have to say.
###1512 I invite you to beam aboard the Farragut.
###1514 Bring your senior staff with you if you prefer.
###1516 Captain, I have verified their ship's registry and command codes.
###1520 But much of the vessels internal configuration
###1523 does not match fleet specifications.
###1525 - I can explain that, too. - I just bet you can.
###1530 How about this, "Captain"?
###1532 You and your senior officers beam over here.
###1534 And I promise, I'll have a security team standing by.
###1537 Pike out.
###1539 Number one, care to hear this explanation?
###1542 Certainly, sir.
###1543 Dr Boyce, meet us in the transporter room.
###1577 You bring a Klingon to my ship, and I'm supposed to trust you?
###1580 All explanations are off, take them to the brig.
###1583 No, wait!
###1584 Captain Pike, you're right.
###1588 At least sort of... It's well...
###1596 We're from your future.
###1597 Well, Doctor?
###1598 They are as they appear to be. Two humans and one Klingon.
###1602 Completely normal. As for if they are from the future...
###1604 Fleet personal roster, shows a James T. Kirk
###1608 assigned to USS  Farragut, Lieutenant Junior Grade.
###1611 Captain Pike, you were about...
###1612 You still havenâ€™t said why you are commanding the Farragut.
###1614 I have been in command of the Farragut for the last ten years. Since Garrovick died.
###1618 It's not in the computer.
###1620 We could have destroyed you with our torpedoes,
###1621 long before we were in range of your phasers. Have you asked yourselves why we didn't?
###1626 I can think of a hundred reasons.
###1627 Perhaps to commandeer the Enterprise, as you did Farragut.
###1630 I didn't commandeer the Farragut. You are approaching a source of
###1633 high temporal disturbance, am I right?
###1635 [Intercom] Spock here. Captain, we are approaching
###1638 the coordinates of the temporal disturbance.
###1640 Thank you, Lieutenant.
###1642 have Mr Tyler reduce speed to half impulse.
###1644 And when you get there, you'll find a device that's so destructive,
###1647 it will be laying waste to planets for many years to come.
###1650 Chris, someone told me that you were going to be difficult to convince.
###1654 He told me to remind you that you once lost your heart on a world
###1657 where leaves sing and dreams find life.
###1660 Who told you that?
###1662 Another Starfleet officer who holds his former Captain in high regard.
###1667 They tell me he is going to be my first Officer in the future.
###1671 At least, if we survive, to face the future.
###1677 Commander Spock.
###1680 Report.
###1681 Captain, we're approaching the coordinates of the time ripple.
###1685 And we are not the only one.
###1696 Raise the Klingon.
###1697 No response, Captain.
###1699 It's not the same.
###1700 No. But maybe this is what they looked like before giving years of battle.
###1704 Or perhaps this is a design from the opposing side.
###1708 The winning side.
###1710 Do you have something to share?
###1713 Captain, that is an unmanned weapon from the future.
###1718 That's ridiculous. It would have been impossible for a technology to have advanced so quickly.
###1723 It is not our weapon.
###1724 But we do have an idea on how to destroy this thing.
###1726 My science officer will provide you with the necessary specifications.
###1730 Chris, our two ships are going to have to work together,
###1733 if we are going to destroy this thing.
###1739 You have one minute to beam back to your ship and transmit the data.
###1744 Kirk to Farragut.
###1745 Get us back quick, Rand. And stand-by to raise
###1748 the deflector shields, as soon as we're aboard.
###1749 Yes, sir.
###1753 Red Alert.
###1754 Shields at full intensity.
###1758 Red Alert. All hands man your battle stations.
###1761 This is not a drill.
###1764 - You know what to do, Mr Kargh? - Aye, sir.
###1767 Rand, plot an intercept course.
###1769 Let's see if we can take some of the heat off the Klingons
###1776 Ships weapons at full charge, Captain.
###1778 I suggest you target these coordinates.
###1780 Very good. Mr Tyler, one quick pass, to get its attention.
###1784 Aye, sir.
###1795 I think you've got its attention, Captain.
###1797 Recharge weapons. Number one, what's your summary of Kirk's data?
###1800 I'd say they are being optimistic, Captain.
###1805 That was a disruptor hit.
###1808 Captain, the Klingon is firing at the Enterprise.
###1811 - Hail them. - The Klingon is hailing us, sir.
###1813 I'm Captain James T....
###1815 Stay out of this fight, Earther.
###1818 We don't need help from your garbage scow. And your weapons of peace.
###1822 And your weakling starship. This prize is ours!
###1827 Commander, without our help, there will be no prize. You will die.
###1832 With honour. (Evasive action)
###1835 Father.
###1836 Who dares?
###1839 I am Kargh.
###1841 Son of Korogh and Bregia.
###1843 (I speak the truth)
###1844 Sir.
###1845 The Enterprise is signalling, ready!
###1848 I see my son in you
###1852 But greatly changed.
###1855 What sort of trick is this?
###1857 It is no trick, father.
###1859 We are joined with the Earthers to stop this killing machine.
###1863 Then together we shall!
###1865 Then afterwards, you'll join me
###1868 in skinning the Earthers!
###1871 (Torpedoes fired)
###1872 Father!
###1885 Captain, it's turning back towards us.
###1888 What the hell have they gotten us into?
###1890 Deflector modifications completed.
###1892 Waiting on the signal from Farragut.
###1894 I'm getting pretty damn tired of waiting for this Captain Kirk!
###1897 We'll send that monster back where it came from.
###1907 Captain.
###1908 I see it, Mr Kargh.
###1910 As soon as we're into position, fire into that thing.
###1915 Captain, engineering reports, deflector is over 120 percent.
###1918 It was never made for this kind of work.
###1921 The Enterprise wants to live as much as we do, number one.
###1923 You won't fail us!
###1930 It is preparing to fire, Captain.
###1932 Keep us out of reach, DeSalle.
###1933 That was my plan, sir.
###1939 Kyle, take over navigation.
###1940 Dr McCoy to the bridge. Medical emergency.
###1947 You call that, staying out of reach, Mister?
###1949 No, sir.
###1951 Uhura, can you raise the Enterprise?
###1952 I'll try, sir.
###1954 Enterprise, this is Farragut.
###1956 Come in, Enterprise... do you read?
###1959 Farragut calling Enterprise. Please respond.
###1961 - Acknowledge. - Aye, sir.
###1963 - This is crazy. - Steady, Mr Tyler.
###1965 In order to make this work, we have to stay right in the line of fire. This is suicide.
###1968 It's turning towards us again.
###1981 - Mr DeSalle. - I'm trying, Captain.
###1988 Status, Mr Scott?
###1989 The circuits overloaded, Captain!
###1998 - How long do you intend this to go on? - As long as it takes.
###2001 Captain, the Enterprise cannot survive another attack.
###2003 Sir, Enterprise is charging weapons.
###2005 Anti-proton readings are spiking. The planet killer is also preparing to fire.
###2008 They'll be destroyed...
###2009 Kyle! DeSalle!
###2011 Primary systems failing.
###2012 Can't control the circuits, sir.
###2014 I am getting high anti-proton readings.
###2015 All hands brace for impact.
###2017 Enterprise hold your fire.
###2027 Well I'll be damned!
###2028 The Farragut distracted it. Made it stop firing at us.
###2031 Kirk took the heat of us.
###2033 Let's see if we can do the same for him.
###2035 - Under and over, Mr Tyler. - Aye, sir.
###2037 Captain. I have been studying the data from their planet-killer.
###2040 There may be a way to slow it down, but it involves a...
###2043 ... considerable amount of waste.
###2049 All this, for a history we don't know?
###2051 For people we may or may not become?
###2054 Captain. Call it off while you still can.
###2057 Shield energy is fluctuating, Captain.
###2065 Sir, the Enterprise, it is gone!
###2068 Gone?
###2074 They intercepted the beam meant for us - and then
###2077 Vaporized!
###2089 Casualty reports coming in from all decks, sir.
###2094 - Kyle. - Sir?
###2096 Class-K planetoid, bearing two three zero.
###2098 Are we going to hide, Captain?
###2100 Hide? Your damn right, Mr Kargh. Because I'm not ready to die with honour.
###2110 Kirk, this is Pike. Veer off!. Veer off!
###2113 Captain, it's...
###2114 Do it, helm, full thrusters.
###2123 (Success)
###2124 That will take the wind out of her. Right or not.
###2125 Kirk, if that fancy ship of yours, can get off the mat,
###2129 it's time we finished this thing off.
###2130 Aye, Aye, Captain.
###2132 Helm, firing position.
###2138 - Keep it steady, Mr Tyler. - I'm trying, sir.
###2141 - Number one? - Readings are off the scale, Captain.
###2144 It is working.
###2149 Lt Uhura, stand down from red alert and hail the Enterprise.
###2152 Coming on screen, sir.
###2154 - Captain. - Captain.
###2156 Well, Kirk.
###2157 I'm surprised to see that fancy ship, of yours, still in one piece.
###2160 Looks like the Enterprise will be around, for a few more years, as well.
###2164 Although may heaven help the engineer that's got to oversee that refit.
###2167 Refit?
###2171 What makes you think she needs a refit?
###2174 Thanks for your help. The Guardian should retrieve us soon.
###2177 - Good luck, Captain Kirk. - The same, Captain Pike.
###2194 Mr Kargh?
###2195 I have no explanation, Captain.
###2198 All indications are that by correcting the time-line,
###2201 we should be returned to our own history.
###2203 It seems Mr Kargh miscalculated.
###2205 The planet-killer moved ahead in time by only a few years.
###2208 How few?
###2209 - Uncertain. - We will have to go after it.
###2210 Request permission to return to duty.
###2212 Granted, Lieutenant. Assume your station.
###2215 Mr Kargh, feed your time calculations to the navigation console.
###2218 - Rand - you have to follow it. - Sir?
###2220 It gives off time ripples.
###2222 You and DeSalle will have to track it by the flow of time.
###2225 Flows, eddies, bent blades of grass. Whatever it takes.
###2229 - Yes, sir. - Understood, Captain.
###2232 Mr Kargh,
###2233 Prepare their calculations for a sling-shot effect.
###2236 Hold on, Kirk. Our two ships together, barely survived last time.
###2240 The Enterprise will see this through.
###2242 Out of the question, Chris.
###2243 The Enterprise could never survive the pounding of breakaway.
###2246 Shall I alert Starfleet, Captain?
###2249 No.
###2250 Even telling that many people, may contaminate the future.
###2253 Just keep your eyes open for us.
###2255 Kirk out!
###2256 Helm, let's go.
###2266 600 days to go...
###2267 400,.. 300,.. Mr Rand.
###2270 I see it.
###2271 Adjusting course.
###2278 Farragut, do you read?
###2280 Farragut, do you read?
###2282 We're still in the past.
###2284 Farragut, do you read?
###2285 Mr Kargh?
###2286 Our time coordinates are correct, Captain.
###2288 I think I can clear up the signal, sir.
###2290 On screen, Lieutenant.
###2292 Farragut, do you read?
###2294 - Pike calling Farragut. - Pike?
###2296 Where's Enterprise? How did you know where to find us?
###2299 Find you? I wasn't even looking.
###2301 It is possible the currents in time we were followingâ€¦
###2304 Also washed Pike up on the same shore.
###2307 And the planet-killer is less than 15 minutes behind us.
###2310 I was afraid you were going to say that, Mr Kargh.
###2312 Kirk, I've got a J-class full of green cadets on a training mission.
###2316 A J-class vessel may not have enough power...
###2317 That's why you are headed for the hangar deck, Mr Kargh.
###2319 I want you to find out how many shuttlecraft and how much anti-matter, we can spare.
###2324 - Mr Scott. - Aye, sir.
###2325 Take the mains offline and ramp them up 25 points past the red line.
###2329 I don't want that thing to have any trouble finding us at the supper table.
###2332 Now on your way.
###2335 Fleet Captain, shall we make sure our guest receives the appropriate welcome?
###2341 Your place or mine?
###2351 Scott to Bridge.
###2353 It's time to ring the dinner bell.
###2355 Alright, beasty.
###2358 Come and get it!
###2409 Stand-by, DeSalle.
###2416 The Doomsday machine is coming in range.
###2418 - That's your cue, Mr DeSalle. - Aye, sir.
###2431 Five,
###2432 Four,
###2433 Three,
###2435 Two,
###2436 One,
###2438 Zero.
###2443 Sir,
###2443 I am getting massive anti-proton readings.
###2445 On screen.
###2449 Shields. Full reverse. Get us out of here.
###2458 Life support's gone!
###2459 Main power failure. Switching to auxiliary.
###2461 Auxiliary will not be enough for the deflector charge, Captain.
###2464 We need more power.
###2465 More direct power!
###2468 Captain, that heading will take us right...
###2469 Right into the belly of that beast.
###2478 Kirk, what the blazes are you doing?
###2480 Saving the future.
###2483 Not alone.
###2487 Computer, this is captain.
###2489 - Destruct sequence! Code One... - Captain, I'm getting new readings.
###2491 From where?
###2502 This is Admiral Kirk. Get out of there, NOW!
###2505 Do it, helm, full thrusters.
###2519 It's not dead, just knocked out for a while.
###2521 Then let's finish it!
###2522 The anti-proton charge will only overload when the machine is operating.
###2525 He's right. The chance will come soon enough. I suggest you begin your repairs.
###2529 I'm getting pretty damn tired of this!
###2531 Is time travel just something you guys do in the future?
###2535 Chris, it's good to see you on your feet.
###2537 I'm guessing that you're from the future, Admiral?
###2541 That is a logical assumption.
###2543 2373 to be precise.
###2546 You both look, remarkably well.
###2550 Ambassador Spock and I have been through death and life together.
###2554 That is an understatement.
###2558 Admiral, I assume your appearance here is no accident.
###2562 No.
###2563 In our time-line, the destruction of the Farragut was insufficient,
###2566 to stop the planet killer.
###2567 We pulled every ship out of mothballs to fight those things.
###2570 Science, of the 24th Century, is sufficiently advanced to destroy a doomsday-machine.
###2575 Without sacrificing a starship or her crew.
###2578 And if we can stop this one, this war will never occur.
###2582 But we have to get it from our time to yours.
###2585 - It's as simple as that. - Captain Pike
###2587 I am reading high levels of delta- radiation aboard your vessel.
###2591 The baffle plating around our reactor took the worst beating.
###2594 We're making repairs. Pike out.
###2600 Admiral?
###2603 They don't say goodbye in the future?
###2605 No, more than that, he knows something.
###2609 Let's see your readings from the Guardian.
###2611 Captain?
###2614 There it is.
###2616 Farragut to Kirk. Admiral, I know what you and Spock are trying to do.
###2621 You can't do this.
###2622 Things have to follow their natural course.
###2625 It's not the natural course, if it's because that thing attacked.
###2628 Isn't that what we are trying to do, here?
###2630 making right what the doomsday machine put wrong?
###2632 But this isn't wrong.
###2634 Chris Pike's accident is part of your history.
###2637 It should be part of mine.
###2638 Not this time
###2640 Admiral, there's got to be another way.
###2642 Captain, believe me when I say, this is the better way.
###2646 The Enterprise transporters have been activated.
###2649 Someone just beamed aboard the Daedalus.
###2651 Admiral.
###2652 - Kirk! - He's stopped transmitting, sir.
###2655 Open that door and you will flood this ship with delta radiation.
###2657 Not if we seal this room and recirculate the air.
###2659 Captain. Chris, you cannot.
###2662 Maybe you're right.
###2670 They'll die if we don't get them out.
###2680 Chris!
###2685 Chris!
###2691 Ambassador, you are needed back aboard the Enterprise.
###2695 Captain, Enterprise has reactivated her transporter.
###2702 Status report, Mr Scott.
###2703 - Everything's ready, Captain. - Well done, Scotty.
###2705 - Kargh, contact both ships. - Yes, sir.
###2707 We have played tag with doomsday long enough.
###2710 It's time we finished this.
###2721 Readings off the scale.
###2726 Anti-proton energy was at sufficient levels, Captain.
###2730 It has gone back where it came from.
###2732 Well done, Admiral, well done!
###2734 Captain,
###2735 I am getting dangerously high readings of delta radiation, from the cadet vessel.
###2740 Located near the aft reactor room.
###2744 No fatalities as best as I can tell.
###2749 Fleet Captain Pike has suffered severe radiation poisoning.
###2752 The Daedalus will make it to Starbase 11, where he will receive the best medical attention.
###2757 I wish we could have done more.
###2758 We will, Captain.
###2760 We will.
###2761 It's only a matter of time.
###2764 Oh, Jim
###2765 Contact Carol.
###2767 It's a boy.
###2800 [Tanoy] Dr Donovan, please report to astrophysics lab...
###2808 [Two beeps = No]
###2814 Do not despair.
###2816 There are alternatives.
###2818 The Spock, you know will soon arrive.
###2821 His plan will work, Captain.
###2824 It is a foregone certainty.
###2827 But I must know it is what you want.
###2829 [Two beeps = No]
###2831 Captain, do you remember what Dr Boyce often said about living one's life to the fullest?
###2838 One lives life as it happens.
###2841 Meeting it head on,
###2843 or turning his back on it and withering away.
###2846 Do not choose to wither away.
###2850 Live long and prosper.
###2857 Energize.
###2862 [One beep = Yes]
###2865 Captain Pike?
###2867 Captain Pike?
###2870 You remember these Gentlemen? They wanted to visit you.
###2902 Spock to Enterprise. One to beam-up.
###2915 [Gateway] Time has resumed its shape. All is as it was before.
###2923 Many such journeys are possible.
###2925 Let me be your Gateway.
