###13 RYAN DUFFY: Whereas in America, hip-hop long ago
###15 migrated from the ghettos to the gated communities, in
###18 Venezuela it's all of the guns, none of the glamour, and
###21 more of the violence.
###22 So we headed back to Petare to meet up with El Prieto, the
###25 king of Venezuelan hip-hop.
###27 EL PRIETO: [RAPPING IN SPANISH]
###28 
###38 RYAN DUFFY: As a former member of the massively popular
###40 hip-hop collective Guerrilla Seca, Prieto commands the
###43 respect of Petare and was an ideal insider tour guide
###47 through the city's most dangerous slums.
###49 
###60 Did you just catch that teenager with a handgun?
###62 MALE SPEAKER 1: Did you just see that?
###64 MALE SPEAKER 2: He's our security.
###65 RYAN DUFFY: Oh, he's with security.
###67 All right.
###68 Don't worry.
###69 The teenager with the handgun is our security apparently.
###72 
###76 We headed up to El Prieto's house where his underage
###79 security detail was standing guard.
###83 How are you doing?
###84 I'll shake that hand without the gun in it.
###85 
###88 Can you talk a little bit about the way that growing up
###90 here has influenced your music career?
###93 EL PRIETO: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###94 
###113 RYAN DUFFY: Sorry, that little child has a huge gun.
###117 Right behind that wall.
###120 Sorry, it's a little bit distracting.
###121 EL PRIETO: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###123 RYAN DUFFY: It's not something I'm used to
###124 seeing all the time.
###125 I understand it's different for you.
###126 EL PRIETO: [SPEAKING SPANISH]

###147 MALE SPEAKER 3: [SPEAKING SPANISH]

###212 RYAN DUFFY: Considering all the 13-year-olds we saw
###214 carrying guns, this seemed like a reasonable prediction.
###217 Before we left, Prieto quieted the streets so he could show
###220 off his freestyle skills.

###260 RYAN DUFFY: Prieto's optimism was a nice closing note.
###262 But he was also flanked by a bunch of guys
###264 with guns at the time.
###266 While all these guns look great in his music videos, in
###269 the streets of Caracas they're a terrifying reminder of
###272 Venezuela's epidemic of violence, and could very well
###276 be the undoing of Chavez's socialist revolution.
