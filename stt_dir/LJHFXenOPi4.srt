2
0:0:8,29 --> 0:0:10,66
NARRATOR: People are getting
killed in Karachi every day.


3
0:0:10,66 --> 0:0:14,12
There's gang violence, tons of
mafia, sectarian killings, and


4
0:0:14,12 --> 0:0:16,38
in more recent years,
suicide bombings.


5
0:0:16,38 --> 0:0:19,43
But for the political parties,
it's a massive turf war.


6
0:0:19,43 --> 0:0:22,8
And while politicians and
businessmen would never admit


7
0:0:22,8 --> 0:0:24,71
that they engage in
assassinating their rivals,


8
0:0:24,71 --> 0:0:29,5
someone is hiring the so-called
target killers.


9
0:0:29,5 --> 0:0:31,6
We wanted to interview one of
the men responsible for this


10
0:0:31,6 --> 0:0:34,605
dirty work, so we arranged a
meeting with a target killer.


11
0:0:34,605 --> 0:0:37,94
It was uncomfortable for
everyone involved.


12
0:0:37,94 --> 0:0:39,86
We negotiated the terms
of the interview--


13
0:0:39,86 --> 0:0:43,41
in a moving car and with his
motorcycle helmet on.


14
0:0:43,41 --> 0:0:46,83
And not surprisingly, the guy
who kills people for money--


15
0:0:46,83 --> 0:0:48,718
he wanted to get paid.

that was intense.


75
0:3:54,49 --> 0:3:55,74
INTERVIEWER: That was--


76
0:3:55,74 --> 0:3:59,415



77
0:3:59,415 --> 0:4:8,71
yeah, that was really strange
sitting next to someone who's


78
0:4:8,71 --> 0:4:10,21
killed 35 people.


79
0:4:10,21 --> 0:4:12,85
And you could just tell from
his demeanor and from his


80
0:4:12,85 --> 0:4:14,965
eyes, he was a hard dude.


81
0:4:14,965 --> 0:4:21,17
And there's 600 guys like that
roaming around the city.


82
0:4:21,17 --> 0:4:24,66
Anytime anyone has a beef to
settle with someone else--


83
0:4:24,66 --> 0:4:27,52
they want to kill them-- just
hire one of these guys and


84
0:4:27,52 --> 0:4:30,17
don't pay them that
much money, and


85
0:4:30,17 --> 0:4:31,72
they'll do the work.


86
0:4:31,72 --> 0:4:35,3
It's lawless, wild,
and chaotic here.


87
0:4:35,3 --> 0:4:37,84



88
0:4:37,84 --> 0:4:40,96
And that is some scary shit.


89
0:4:40,96 --> 0:6:40,96
