###0 We've been sending creatures up into space for a long time.
###3 And tardigrades, among other microorganisms, are special in
###6 that they can withstand these extremes of temperature.
###8 So they decided, well, let's see if they can withstand the
###11 real vacuum.
###12 And the perfect vacuum is in space.
###14 As we send tardigrades into space, the
###17 question has to arise--
###19 maybe tardigrades came from space, if they
###21 can withstand it.

###28 [THEME MUSIC]
###50 I consider myself a naturalist.
###52 I've been called a naturalist in a classical sense, which,
###56 for example-- and I'm not comparing myself-- but Charles
###58 Darwin was a naturalist.
###60 He made a contribution to science.
###62 So basically, I'm just an ordinary person, and I like
###66 nature, like most people do.
###69 And being in nature sort of wants to make me study it a
###72 little bit more.
###73 
###76 I wanted to make a contribution to science--
###78 modestly.
###79 I didn't think I'd do anything great, but something.
###82 Maybe something that somebody hadn't done.
###84 And in just looking for various things to do, the word
###89 tardigrade came up.
###90 Didn't even really know what a tardigrade was till
###92 I looked into it.
###94 
###98 So tardigrades are little microscopic creatures.
###101 They're about a millimeter or less in size.
###104 They're very tiny.
###105 Basically, it's a little caterpillar-like creature.
###108 Looks like a caterpillar with eight legs.
###110 And it has claws which look like bear claws.
###112 That's why it's called a water bear.
###114 They have a mouth.
###115 They have a digestive tract.
###117 They have muscles.
###119 They have a nervous system, so they're similar
###121 to us in that way.
###123 They're like insects in that they have
###125 that hard-shell skin.
###127 They reproduce with eggs, and then they molt their skin and
###130 they use their whole body to facilitate digestion.
###135 We don't really know how they evolved.
###137 We can't even guess.
###139 We don't know what other species they're related to,
###142 because they're so different.
###143 And of course, their ability to withstand--
###147 as far as heat, they can survive 120 degrees Celsius,
###151 which is 240 degrees Fahrenheit.
###153 200 or 300 degrees below 0, vacuum of space, 1,000
###157 atmospheres of pressure, x-rays, ultraviolet radiation.
###162 So tardigrades can survive all of these extremes.
###167 Now, if you're looking for tardigrades and you want to
###171 find a good habitat, trees like this, which have deep
###174 furrows in the bark, are best.
###177 So tardigrades have gone into space, where there's a perfect
###180 vacuum, and also there's a lot of solar radiation and
###184 ultraviolet and x-ray radiation in space.
###187 And it's very intense.
###188 It's something more than we can create here on earth.
###191 So that was a great way to test them, and they came back
###193 and survived.

###207 Did tardigrades come from space?
###209 Anything is possible.
###210 We might have come from another galaxy.
###212 The problem is distances across space are so large, and
###216 even if you're traveling as fast as anything can travel,
###219 which is the speed of light, it would take hundreds, if not
###222 thousands, of years to go from one galaxy or
###225 one planet to another.
###227 So in that timeframe, anything can happen.
###230 You can't colonize planets that way.
###233 Not now-- not as far as we know.
###235 So the answer right now is, anything is possible.
###238 I don't have a personal theory about it.
###240 Do I believe in extraterrestrial life--
###243 that life exist outside this planet?
###245 Yeah, I do believe that.
###246 Just because I believe in odds and possibilities.
###249 And because the universe is infinite.
###251 If you can just grasp that, which is hard enough to do.
###253 
###257 There might be other forms of life right under our noses,
###259 such as tardigrades, which are right here, which did come
###262 from other planets.
###263 We don't know that, though.
###265 When I did a little research on it, I found out there
###268 wasn't really that much known about tardigrades.
###272 In fact, I read one scientific paper and found that New
###277 Jersey, the state I was living at the time, had zero
###280 tardigrades showing on the map.
###282 So I said, well, let's see if I can a tardigrade.
###284 
###287 I visited all 21 counties in New Jersey and found that
###291 tardigrades are ubiquitous, which means they're
###294 everywhere.
###295 So I wrote a scientific paper, found various species, took
###299 photographs, identified the trees--
###302 their habitat.
###303 And that paper will be published soon.
###305 It's being reviewed now by one of the prominent
###308 tardigradologists.
###310 And perhaps have even found a new species of tardigrade, so
###314 that's under review now.
###316 I've sent my slides off for analysis.
###319 Now, wait a second.
###321 This could also be a good tardigrade habitat.
###323 This is just ordinary moss.
###325 You just take a piece of moss out and place it into a coin
###331 envelope or a paper bag.
###334 And what you'll find is, even though it's dry right now,
###337 once you rehydrate it, tardigrades will appear.
###340 So we're going to place this moss into the envelope.
###343 How do tardigrades go into what's called cryptobiosis or
###348 suspended animation?
###349 I mean, that's pretty fascinating.
###351 They just curl up into a little ball.
###353 They create a very hard shell, and somehow, some way, within,
###356 there's a seed of moisture, a molecule of water, that
###360 preserves them inside this encrustment.
###362 The lifespan of a tardigrade, if it was just moving around
###365 in the water and you were observing it, might be the
###367 only 6 months.
###368 But because it dries out, rehydrates, dries out,
###371 rehydrates, dries out, rehydrates--
###373 this could be done over a period of many, many years.
###376 This is how they preserve themselves.
###378 Sometimes, they can be 100 years old that way.

###399 [SPEAKING WITH SCOTTISH ACCENT]
###399 Now there's a wee little tardigrade for you.
###403 So what we want to do is actually get
###405 to look at him close-up.
###406 We'll change this objective to a tighter, more powerful lens.
###409 
###414 OK.
###415 Now let's see close-up how he looks.
###416 [JAZZY ELECTRONICA MUSIC]
###422 So when you're looking through the microscope and you're
###423 seeing this little tardigrade moving around in his
###426 environment, he's in the moment.
###427 He's in the now.
###429 He's not thinking about the future.
###430 He's not thinking about the past.
###433 All he's doing is living and enjoying the present moment.
###436 So if we can be more like that--
###438 I'm not saying, let's be like tardigrades.
###440 But what I am saying is, if we can learn acceptance, I think
###443 everybody will be a lot happier.
###444 And I know I've been a lot happier since I've accepted
###447 and embraced life as it is.
