###0 after the tiny into bob dole out personality in the shana pre way who is
###4 a lawyer i wrote this plot for c_n_n_ dot com in in the blog she talks about
###8 our own personal experience with right uh... after she was raped she did become
###11 pregnant and she had decided to have the baby and she had a little girl that she
###16 logs is happy with her decision
###19 but even though she made that decision she has to deal with
###22 consequences if people don't
###24 really think about
###25 and not consequences that
###27 the father of the child wants to have custody
###31 you know we honestly i did forget panel was blown away by so article
###36 and by the concept so and you know
###39 as she points out an article
###41 thirty-one u_s_ states
###44 allow a man who fathered through rape
###47 to get custody of his case right so that show
###52 kanu uh...
###54 an issue an unexplained this puts and extra conundrum among women because
###60 then
###61 their those guys have leverage
###63 and they get into a situation where they say well you could testify against him
###67 but then i will would want visitation rights
###69 or maybe i dropped a visitation rights request if you don't have so far
###74 power
###75 how does that stresses that
###78 under what
###80 muncy
###81 could be states possibly give visitation rights
###84 for the fathers who got the kids through rain
###87 i mean you are not a bad parent
###89 my god i can't recall what would you do anything slightly wrong and i think it
###93 is a way
###94 you're telling me and i know that's an exaggeration
###96 but you know what's really trying to find some way press them make their mom
###100 okay
###101 so this is missus knots
###104 and nonetheless the reform say no no it's ok so cadre person
###108 but apparently thirty percent women choose to have the kid anyway which on
###112 blown away by can't believe that that is an incredible statistic tunes different
###116 studies indicate that thirty percent of women decide to have the baby even if
###119 they were great
###120 but now it is very short standing up my insurance they wanna make that i
###124 understand that right
###126 but for that
###127 republicans they think no we don't want you to have that choice a person an
###131 amendment for example and another two thousand nine uh... acted by the way
###134 paul ryan and eighteen
###136 co-sponsored
###137 would say that
###138 even in a case of rape and incest in fact the g_o_p_ platform the dangerous
###142 path two days ago
###144 says the u_n_ a case of rape and incest it doesn't matter you loss happy kid
###148 that two thousand nine act
###150 makes it criminal
###152 if you have an abortion even if you are right
###155 the so that they know what a mess
###157 the you get raped you have to have the rapist said
###161 and then if you don't they put new wordpress
###164 but if you do have the kid
###166 then you're tethered the rapist for
###168 eighteen years you've got a cm over and over again as it is visitation rights
###172 if anyone different states
###174 for your kid
###176 it's mindboggling
###177 how can anybody both of these people
###179 i know at look as i read this story of her as an actually you know wait out the
###184 facts
###184 iced x_-rated
###186 asked why this happens like why is it that we have these laws that protect the
###190 rapist as opposed to those who have been right threat why would you give these
###194 men visitation rights
###195 and i think it comes to argument that
###199 a lot of you know hateful people liked i can say about legitimate rate maybe
###204 these guys out there think wealth you know we don't know if she was
###208 legitimately rapes so why are we going to take this man child away from him
###212 bingo
###213 anything sebab perspective to date always look at it from a male
###217 perspective and a very calm and i wouldn't want my child taken away and
###220 look
###221 and other state rate is what madeleine panel will be the guide with a quote all
###226 the time we have these crazy rape ideas
###228 abortion ideas for the first place
###229 places obviously marital rape is in town he says that in his book
###233 so
###234 but you know
###236 and what they always say when they say america roe versus wade to and how could
###240 be talked about it
###241 when he had agent on this program just another day saying that you know these
###245 women they offer a lot
###248 and so they could be lying and then you take away the poor fathers his patients
###254 but look this is not a thing you'd idbi proving the court of law you know just
###258 said oh yeah i think that guy who did something wrong
###260 on on twenty investigation rights though is
###263 proven accord a while imperial
###266 if the jury of your peers and charges that are at center
###269 but it's because they don't care and out they don't they are care and also you
###273 have to keep in mind first of all allot of great is unreported in the u_s_ and i
###278 know weitzman reported it's because it's tremendously difficult to prove that
###282 you've been raped
###283 okay because of course to you and that man has to be guilty beyond a reasonable
###286 doubt
###287 and it's difficult when it's a game of he said she said so even if she said no
###292 even if there was afb you know for physical altercation with she tried to
###296 push him off
###297 improve that that's a very difficult thing to prove
###299 so these guys get to continue making these ridiculous arguments about
###303 legitimate rape
###304 where and then at the same time women will get raped in guys get away with it
###308 because they know they can get away with it looks every seven percent country
###311 thinks that
###312 abortion should be believed
###314 some believe additionally your honor all circumstances
###317 but great majority finishing the legal under most circumstances you noted
###321 anybody hannah says beyond twenty weeks you think that it should not be legal
###324 now most people things beyond twenty four weeks it's our lead others arias
###328 was seventy seven percent of us degraded it should not be illegal right in all
###332 sorts of only seventeen percent say illegal under all circumstances
###336 yet but those guys are somehow incharge
###339 now look i was sure you charter graphic file these are the long's that work
###343 past
###344 to restrict abortion rights
###346 uh... since nineteen ninety five
###349 the have added up to seven hundred and
###352 keen different laws
###354 passable most all by republicans
###357 to take away your rights
###358 in all the different states
###360 since nineteen ninety-five and you see a big jump to in twenty ten that's when
###365 even the more radical right wing
###366 republicans take over
###371 it's happening all across the country they're taking away our rights and what
###375 times you don't realize it until you get run into a situation like this woman did
###378 or for c_n_n_
###380 and then you're
###380 cac bo leaving one
###382 that to you
###383 yet but they warned and they are
###385 and they do it all over the country
