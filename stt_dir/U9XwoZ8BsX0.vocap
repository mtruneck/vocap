###5 ANTWUAN DIXON: What you want to do?
###7 Go trip by the pool?
###8 MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.
###9 ANTWUAN DIXON: And talk?
###11 
###13 Yeah, [INAUDIBLE].
###15 
###21 Got my little weights out there.
###23 I already worked out this morning.
###26 I woke up at 7:00, and then I was going to go to the park,
###29 but those fools didn't want to go.
###34 Fucking hot out here, man.
###37 Shits cool, right?
###38 You like it-- the house?
###39 MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.
###40 ANTWUAN DIXON: [COUGHING]
###41 It's cool.
###43 I just be chilling.
###45 So I wake up early, since I don't drink
###48 normally, like I used to.
###51 I'll probably have, like, a beer or some
###53 shit, but that's nothing.
###55 You know, just like poolside chilling.
###58 You're sitting by the pool, you got to have
###61 a beer and a blunt.
###62 That's like mandatory, you know?
###65 It's not how I used to get wasted.
###68 MALE SPEAKER: Welcome back to the show.
###70 Since we started the show, there's a short
###72 list of people that--
###73 like, dream episodes.
###76 And I think Antwuan Dixon, for me, is one of those people
###79 that just like really blew up-- came out with
###81 the "Baker 3" video.
###82 No one had ever heard of him.
###84 At the premiere, people were yelling at the screen,
###86 standing on their seats.
###88 It was a really triumphant entrance into skating.
###91 Antwuan Dixon is a legend.
###93 I mean, from the tattoos all over his face to him being one
###97 of the most gifted skateboarders--
###99 and you'll see from this footage, he goes to this
###101 contest, and people just swarm him.
###104 Kids are like breaking it off, and Antwuan comes in--
###107 no skateboard--
###108 nothing--
###110 and almost, like, wins the contest.
###112 Shows up--
###113 kids are worshipping him.
###114 Older skaters are trying to give him drugs and alcohol.
###118 And it was like he emerged from the contest victorious.
###122 The stuff I filmed is from 10:00 AM till about 8:00 PM.
###126 He's in and out of handcuffs.
###128 I'd never been surrounded by that many cops.
###130 And then I think at about 8:00 PM, I kind of had
###132 enough, and I left.
###134 The paradox is that he's actually kind of a mellow dude
###136 when he's not drunk, when people
###138 aren't giving him drugs.
###139 I'm hoping to explore that.
###141 Who is Antwuan Dixon?
###143 What's his story?
###144 And this is it--
###146 Antwuan Dixon episode.
###147 Hope you enjoy it.
###148 
###155 MALE SPEAKER: What are you going to ask Jim and Erik
###158 about Lizard?
###159 Antwuan?
###159 MALE SPEAKER: What about Lizard?
###160 I'm going to do a Lizard episode
###162 and an Antwuan episode.
###164 How'd you first hear of him?
###167 ERIK ELLINGTON: First heard of Antwuan probably five
###169 or six years ago.
###170 And Angel [INAUDIBLE]
###172 from [INAUDIBLE]
###173 showed me a tape.
###174 I don't know how he got it.
###176 But he was like, yo, check this kid out.
###178 And he was like 15, just killing it.
###183 ANTWUAN DIXON: How'd you get approached to get on Baker?
###185 
###188 ANTWUAN DIXON: By Erik and Andrew at the trade show while
###191 I was watching Eric.
###195 They show him doing Baker at Carlsbad.
###199 And then I seen them, and they're like,
###201 wait, Antwuan Dixon?
###202 I'm like, yeah, like, you know what I'm saying?
###208 What the fuck?
###209 They know me?
###210 That's why I was like, yeah, like--
###213 [INAUDIBLE]
###214 so I'm like, yeah.
###215 And he goes and gets Andrew.
###219 They're like, yeah, some--
###220 blah, blah, blah, blah.
###223 So we like your fucking [INAUDIBLE].
###224 We want to give you a board.
###226 And I was like, for real?
###228 Like, damn.
###230 ERIK ELLINGTON: Me and Andrew asked him if he wanted to get
###232 boards from Baker.
###234 And he was like, yeah-- just real humble, mellow kid--
###236 really, really mellow.
###238 And he's like, yeah sure.
###240 JIM GRECO: Filming the "Baker 3," hear about this kid that
###244 they put on that was just like the most unbelievable thing.
###251 Then I finally seen this part at the premiere, and I was
###254 like fucking blown away.
###255 I couldn't believe my eyes.
###257 ANTWUAN DIXON: You know, it's like, my first premiere, my
###260 name's on the fucking TV.
###262 People were like not really saying nothing.
###265 You know, they're like, what the fuck was this?
###266 But it was so crazy.
###268 I was like looking, and then they're clapping and clapping
###271 as it's going on, and then after it, the
###275 people just went crazy.
###277 
###283 Once it was over, I walked out of there dog, I felt like--
###287 
###289 it was the craziest thing-- like, the craziest
###293 overwhelming feeling, like--
###296 you know like--
###298 like, it was weird, but it wasn't like--
###301 [BREATHING FAST]--
###302 not at the time.
###302 I was just feeling like a--
###304 [BREATHING SLOW]--
###306 like, oh my-- it was weird, like [BREATHING FAST]-- like
###308 finna cry or--
###310 I can't even fucking explain it.
###311 It was just like probably just so fucking happy.
###314 Every little kid's dream-- wants to get
###316 on Baker, you know?
###317 MALE SPEAKER: After that, it was like it was like being on
###320 was like a green light to just be the best or something like
###323 that, because for a certain period of time, he was getting
###327 like two or three tricks a day-- like
###329 gnarly shit, easily.
###330 And it was all "Baker 3," and then I made this "Baker Has a
###333 Death Wish." He has a full-length part in
###335 that one, you know.
###336 That was all of Antwuan--
###338 those three videos--
###339 that's his career to me so far.
###343 ERIK ELLINGTON: So when we approached Antwuan-- like,
###345 we're starting Death Wish as a board company.
###347 You want to ride for it?
###348 He was just automatically into it because he'd been writing
###351 on his grip tape forever and stuff like that.
###353 MALE SPEAKER: And he hadn't been pro yet?
###354 ERIK ELLINGTON: No.
###355 He turned pro for Death Wish.
###356 There was a demand for his board.
###357 And he's really a charismatic dude, so at signings and
###365 stuff, he's just kind of the center of attention.
###369 And it just seems like once all that stuff comes together,
###372 you just go, oh, yeah, he should be pro.
###374 SHANE HEYL: Just to watch him do a three flip or a crook
###377 back 180, it's just like how do you do it like that?
###380 And you have all these other kids trying
###382 to mimic his style.
###384 That's just how he skates.
###385 He's just chilling--
###386 arms down, kind of relaxed-- and that's how he does it.
###388 And you see people faking the funk, where it's just like
###391 they're trying so hard to be like him.
###393 It's like, come on, man.
###394 You can't do that.
###396 MALE SPEAKER: What skaters did you look up to?
###399 ANTWUAN DIXON: There was one dude that I loved out of
###406 everybody, and I still do.
###409 MALE SPEAKER: Who's that?
###410 ANTWUAN DIXON: His name is Gailea Momolu--
###413 best gnarly [INAUDIBLE]--
###414 you know what I'm saying?--
###416 black power--
###417 real quick.
###418 I don't know, it's just like that's why I do [INAUDIBLE]
###422 and [INAUDIBLE].
###422 He's the man of that shit, and I used to just love how he did
###425 it, so I wanted to learn it like him.
###428 So that's why he's my favorite.
###429 He does bomb ass [INAUDIBLE] flips, like gnarly tail slide,
###433 gnarly [INAUDIBLE] lip, gnarly [INAUDIBLE] back lip, gnarly
###435 [INAUDIBLE] back lip.
###437 He's the fucking shit.
###439 He's so good.
###440 My other favorite skaters are Theotis Beasley.
###443 That's my baby.
###444 He's been there, you know?
###447 Just like how he's seen me-- just like how I've seen him,
###450 we came from nothing to something,
###451 you know what I mean?
###452 Two little hood niggers--
###454 you know?-- fuck.
###457 THEOTIS BEASLEY: Yeah, I knew him for years--
###459 yeah, kind of like my brother.
###460 We all grew up around the same area-- me, Antwuan, and
###464 [INAUDIBLE], but them two is on Death
###466 Wish, and I'm on Baker.
###468 Just everybody in the same area happened to be like part
###471 of the same family, and that's real tight.
###473 And Antwuan, yeah, that's my boy.
###474 And he always looked out for me.
###477 And it was fun when we always go on trips together--
###481 everybody together, it's real fun.
###484 ANTWUAN DIXON: And then my other one is fucking Moose.
###490 Oh, my God, that kid is ridiculous.
###492 He is so fucking good.
###494 He's the coolest, nicest little kid, man.
###497 Fuck yeah, Moose.
###497 You're the man, dude.
###498 You're going to be the fucking-- his favorite
###500 skater's [INAUDIBLE], but if he's consistent like the
###504 motherfucker, he's going to be like that fool, I swear.
###507
