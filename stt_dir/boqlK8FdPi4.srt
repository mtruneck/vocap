0:6:7,35 --> 0:6:8,54
that's for sure.


204
0:6:8,54 --> 0:6:9,95
Yeah.


205
0:6:9,95 --> 0:6:12,52
EDDY MORETTI: Do you eat the
fish out of this river?


206
0:6:12,52 --> 0:6:13,837
LOU: No, not now.


207
0:6:13,837 --> 0:6:15,9
[LAUGHTER]


208
0:6:15,9 --> 0:6:17,3
LOU: Years ago, yeah,
but not no more.


209
0:6:17,3 --> 0:6:18,67
EDDY MORETTI: We're in the
middle of nowhere, and you


210
0:6:18,67 --> 0:6:20,642
can't eat the fish.


211
0:6:20,642 --> 0:6:23,46
OK, let's go look at this close
and read this thing,


212
0:6:23,46 --> 0:6:26,37
"the first thing you notice
about the wood bison is its


213
0:6:26,37 --> 0:6:29,6
majestic appearance, and
rightly so." What


214
0:6:29,6 --> 0:6:29,99
they've done is--


215
0:6:29,99 --> 0:6:33,39
this is reclaimed land.


216
0:6:33,39 --> 0:6:36,97
So, and this is, like, they've
made it into a park.


217
0:6:36,97 --> 0:6:39,44
It's called Wood Bison Park,
I think, and they're


218
0:6:39,44 --> 0:6:41,1
very proud of it.


219
0:6:41,1 --> 0:6:43,85
And they put a herd
of bison back in.


220
0:6:43,85 --> 0:6:45,73
There's a few over here.


221
0:6:45,73 --> 0:6:48,16
The most interesting thing about
this park is if you look


222
0:6:48,16 --> 0:6:53,1
over there, that's Suncor
spewing out pollution.


223
0:6:53,1 --> 0:6:56,59
LOU: And this stuff, here,
it's not snow.


224
0:6:56,59 --> 0:6:59,34
That's what they call,
"sinkered snow."


225
0:6:59,34 --> 0:7:0,71
EDDY MORETTI: What's
sinkered snow?


226
0:7:0,71 --> 0:7:2,97
LOU: Basically it's
humidity from what


227
0:7:2,97 --> 0:7:3,89
you see, right there.


228
0:7:3,89 --> 0:7:4,65
EDDY MORETTI: Yeah.


229
0:7:4,65 --> 0:7:6,47
LOU: It creates its
own weather, so it


230
0:7:6,47 --> 0:7:8,43
creates its own snow.


231
0:7:8,43 --> 0:7:11,58
EDDY MORETTI: This plant
produces its own weather.


232
0:7:11,58 --> 0:7:12,82
This is fake snow.


233
0:7:12,82 --> 0:7:15,68
This is condensation from
all of that polluted


234
0:7:15,68 --> 0:7:17,59
steam that's rising.


235
0:7:17,59 --> 0:7:19,87
And if you look at it,
it just looks weird.


236
0:7:19,87 --> 0:7:21,42
It doesn't look like
proper snow.


237
0:7:21,42 --> 0:7:24,32
It's all freaky.


238
0:7:24,32 --> 0:7:26,64
It's polluted--


239
0:7:26,64 --> 0:7:28,14
it's pollution.


240
0:7:28,14 --> 0:7:31,35
It's fake snow.


241
0:7:31,35 --> 0:7:32,4
[GASP]


242
0:7:32,4 --> 0:7:33,3
EDDY MORETTI: I can't
feel my fingers.


243
0:7:33,3 --> 0:7:34,6
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: Me neither,
me neither.


244
0:7:34,6 --> 0:7:36,54
EDDY MORETTI: OK.


245
0:7:36,54 --> 0:7:39,905
GEORGE POITRAS: We don't
disagree with development.


246
0:7:39,905 --> 0:7:44,59
We don't disagree that
energy is required


247
0:7:44,59 --> 0:7:46,35
throughout the world.


248
0:7:46,35 --> 0:7:50,72
We disagree when the President
of the United States, though,


249
0:7:50,72 --> 0:7:57,64
suggests, at any expense, that
his solution to the United


250
0:7:57,64 --> 0:8:1,62
States' energy crisis should
come from the oil sands versus


251
0:8:1,62 --> 0:8:3,33
Saudi Arabia, now.


252
0:8:3,33 --> 0:8:7,44
Because like anywhere, we
will, still, be the


253
0:8:7,44 --> 0:8:10,54
inhabitants of the
land once the


254
0:8:10,54 --> 0:8:12,42
resources have been exploited.


255
0:8:12,42 --> 0:8:13,57
EDDY MORETTI: So this is it--


256
0:8:13,57 --> 0:8:14,956
Fort Chip--


257
0:8:14,956 --> 0:8:15,37
GEORGE POITRAS: Yeah.


258
0:8:15,37 --> 0:8:20,12
EDDY MORETTI: Fort Chipewyan,
oldest settled community in


259
0:8:20,12 --> 0:8:22,5
Alberta, 1788.


260
0:8:22,5 --> 0:8:26,43
They came up over the northern
part of Canada, and--


261
0:8:26,43 --> 0:8:27,2
GEORGE POITRAS: Yeah.


262
0:8:27,2 --> 0:8:28,6
EDDY MORETTI: --settled here.


263
0:8:28,6 --> 0:8:32,14
Anthropologists trace these
communities back 12,000 years?


264
0:8:32,14 --> 0:8:34,314
GEORGE POITRAS: About
12,000 years, yeah.


265
0:8:34,314 --> 0:8:35,178
EDDY MORETTI: Wow.


266
0:8:35,178 --> 0:8:39,37
PAT MARCEL: If we could survive,
you know, almost on a


267
0:8:39,37 --> 0:8:43,7
daily basis, we didn't
destroy anything--


268
0:8:43,7 --> 0:8:46,15
we've been here 10,000
years, and look


269
0:8:46,15 --> 0:8:49,35
for the Indian footprint.


270
0:8:49,35 --> 0:8:50,79
You won't see it.


271
0:8:50,79 --> 0:8:54,85
I never said I was against
development, but it's got to


272
0:8:54,85 --> 0:8:57,39
be sustainable development.


273
0:8:57,39 --> 0:9:0,78
Everything has to fit
in a certain way


274
0:9:0,78 --> 0:9:2,69
to make things work.


275
0:9:2,69 --> 0:9:6,58
If you throw something out of
balance, something's out of


276
0:9:6,58 --> 0:9:8,27
kilter, right away.


277
0:9:8,27 --> 0:9:10,7
Things go wrong.


278
0:9:10,7 --> 0:9:11,15
We've got cancer rates.


279
0:9:11,15 --> 0:9:13,41
We've got arsenic in moose.


280
0:9:13,41 --> 0:9:14,4
That's only the start.


281
0:9:14,4 --> 0:9:16,38
That's only in 60 years.


282
0:9:16,38 --> 0:9:17,91
Everybody will dispute that.


283
0:9:17,91 --> 0:9:21,64
Each level of government that
comes here will dispute that.


284
0:9:21,64 --> 0:9:22,46
But we know.


285
0:9:22,46 --> 0:9:23,67
We're the people
who are dying.


286
0:9:23,67 --> 0:9:26,23
We should know who's dying,
here, and of what.


287
0:9:26,23 --> 0:9:29,66
If I'm put in a corner,
you know,


288
0:9:29,66 --> 0:9:32,47
I'm going to do something.


289
0:9:32,47 --> 0:9:35,18
And that's what I started to
feel like, you know, like I'm


290
0:9:35,18 --> 0:9:37,86
being pushed.


291
0:9:37,86 --> 0:9:40,0
SIMON DYER: There are five
First Nations in the Fort


292
0:9:40,0 --> 0:9:42,93
McMurray area.


293
0:9:42,93 --> 0:9:45,68
Two of the most impacted by oil
sands development are the


294
0:9:45,68 --> 0:9:48,85
Mikisew Cree First Nation and
the Athabasca Chipewyan First


295
0:9:48,85 --> 0:9:51,21
Nation, who live downstream of
Fort McMurray in the community


296
0:9:51,21 --> 0:9:52,93
of Fort Chipewyan.


297
0:9:52,93 --> 0:9:57,99
And they obviously have been a
lot of concerns about use of


298
0:9:57,99 --> 0:9:59,83
the Athabasca River-- still
being able to fish, still


299
0:9:59,83 --> 0:10:2,3
being able to eat the fish,
still being able to get out on


300
0:10:2,3 --> 0:10:5,68
the land and trap and pass
on their traditions.


301
0:10:5,68 --> 0:10:8,7
Fort McKay First Nation, which
is, actually, right in the oil


302
0:10:8,7 --> 0:10:12,115
sands area-- they, actually,
have, obviously, oil sands on


303
0:10:12,115 --> 0:10:14,1
the reserve lands, and they're,
actually, developing


304
0:10:14,1 --> 0:10:16,27
a portion of those in
partnership with Shell


305
0:10:16,27 --> 0:10:18,125
LINDSAY TELFER: You know, it's
kind of-- they got the raw end


306
0:10:18,125 --> 0:10:18,7
of the stick.


307
0:10:18,7 --> 0:10:20,47
They're, sort of, screwed
both ways.


308
0:10:20,47 --> 0:10:23,2
So why not get some money.


309
0:10:23,2 --> 0:10:24,2
Right, like--


310
0:10:24,2 --> 0:10:24,81
EDDY MORETTI: That's
short thinking.


311
0:10:24,81 --> 0:10:26,4
You shouldn't be thinking
like that.


312
0:10:26,4 --> 0:10:26,38
LINDSAY TELFER: I,
totally, agree.


313
0:10:26,38 --> 0:10:29,24
I'm not-- you know-- but I try
to understand where they're


314
0:10:29,24 --> 0:10:30,23
coming from.


315
0:10:30,23 --> 0:10:33,88
Their community is surrounded
by these mines.


316
0:10:33,88 --> 0:10:37,29
Their land is just
being taken away.


317
0:10:37,29 --> 0:10:40,96
And I think that they're
starting to realize, as well,


318
0:10:40,96 --> 0:10:43,71
that they're getting a bit of
a raw end of the stick.


319
0:10:43,71 --> 0:10:46,68
The Treaty 8 First Nations have
just called for a class


320
0:10:46,68 --> 0:10:49,49
environmental social impact
assessment in the region.


321
0:10:49,49 --> 0:10:51,0
EDDY MORETTI: Hasn't there
been one already?


322
0:10:51,0 --> 0:10:52,38
LINDSAY TELFER: No.


323
0:10:52,38 --> 0:10:56,92
The mercury levels in moose
meat have skyrocketed.


324
0:10:56,92 --> 0:10:59,54
And so now they're at-- can
we eat moose anymore.


325
0:10:59,54 --> 0:11:0,86
Can they-- you know,
caribou have been


326
0:11:0,86 --> 0:11:2,525
pushed out of the region.


327
0:11:2,525 --> 0:11:4,17
And so they're not there.


328
0:11:4,17 --> 0:11:6,99
And so the subsistence lifestyle
of many of the


329
0:11:6,99 --> 0:11:11,21
northern First Nations is
rapidly disappearing.


330
0:11:11,21 --> 0:11:14,88
If you want to destroy a
culture, then all you need to


331
0:11:14,88 --> 0:11:16,95
do is lock up their food.


332
0:11:16,95 --> 0:11:19,65
And that's what she sees these
processes as doing-- is


333
0:11:19,65 --> 0:11:24,49
locking up their food to force
them into buying into what


334
0:11:24,49 --> 0:11:27,63
they see as the "white
man world."


335
0:11:27,63 --> 0:11:30,19
EDDY MORETTI: We were up in Fort
Chipewyan the other day.


336
0:11:30,19 --> 0:11:32,95
We flew up there, and we were
talking to the chief there.


337
0:11:32,95 --> 0:11:34,63
What's the water quality
like there?


338
0:11:34,63 --> 0:11:39,14
Are you concerned at all about
contamination in the water.


339
0:11:39,14 --> 0:11:40,0
I mean--


340
0:11:40,0 --> 0:11:42,2
MELISSA BLAKE: We test water
quality, so I would suggest


341
0:11:42,2 --> 0:11:45,54
that the testing that's done is
probably giving assurances


342
0:11:45,54 --> 0:11:48,3
to residents that whatever
you drink is appropriate.


343
0:11:48,3 --> 0:11:50,3
EDDY MORETTI: If you knew that
people wouldn't drink the


344
0:11:50,3 --> 0:11:53,76
water from the rivers, would
that be enough for you to--


345
0:11:53,76 --> 0:11:54,61
MELISSA BLAKE: I still won't.


346
0:11:54,61 --> 0:11:55,0
EDDY MORETTI: No.


347
0:11:55,0 --> 0:11:56,51
MELISSA BLAKE: I put it through
a filtering system.


348
0:11:56,51 --> 0:11:57,51
EDDY MORETTI: Right.


349
0:11:57,51 --> 0:11:59,176
MELISSA BLAKE: That's what gives
me my assurance that


350
0:11:59,176 --> 0:12:1,2
when it comes out of my
tap, I can drink it.


351
0:12:1,2 --> 0:12:3,72
So nobody is going to go back to
the belief that they could


352
0:12:3,72 --> 0:12:5,99
ever take water from a stream,
probably, and--


353
0:12:5,99 --> 0:12:8,37
EDDY MORETTI: Which was shocking
to me, because I'm


354
0:12:8,37 --> 0:12:11,49
living in New York for about a
decade, and I thought this far


355
0:12:11,49 --> 0:12:14,64
north, we're eating snow and
drinking from the river.


356
0:12:14,64 --> 0:12:16,34
MELISSA BLAKE: Why would
anybody anywhere?


357
0:12:16,34 --> 0:12:18,69
EDDY MORETTI: Returning to the
land as some kind of idyllic


358
0:12:18,69 --> 0:12:20,9
idea is, probably--


359
0:12:20,9 --> 0:12:22,89
those days are gone, right?


360
0:12:22,89 --> 0:12:24,14
MELISSA BLAKE: I
wouldn't know.


361
0:12:24,14 --> 0:12:26,74



362
0:12:26,74 --> 0:12:28,2
PAT MARCEL: Yeah, and it
has been a concern


363
0:12:28,2 --> 0:12:30,58
for a good many years.


364
0:12:30,58 --> 0:12:34,42
They just dumped all the
dioxins and [INAUDIBLE]


365
0:12:34,42 --> 0:12:36,52
directly into the Athabasca.


366
0:12:36,52 --> 0:12:39,4
And people are wondering how
come we're getting sick, here,


367
0:12:39,4 --> 0:12:40,54
and dying of rare cancers.


368
0:12:40,54 --> 0:12:43,59
But they dump 4,000
other chemicals


369
0:12:43,59 --> 0:12:47,14
every day in the Athabasca.


370
0:12:47,14 --> 0:12:48,96
GEORGE POITRAS: Even 20 years
ago, you could go in the


371
0:12:48,96 --> 0:12:53,21
river, which a lot of our people
do for cultural and


372
0:12:53,21 --> 0:12:53,91
other reasons.


373
0:12:53,91 --> 0:12:57,51
They were able to scoop water
from the river and drink it


374
0:12:57,51 --> 0:13:2,7
without any concern about
contaminants in the water.


375
0:13:2,7 --> 0:13:3,65
Today, nobody would
drink the water.


376
0:13:3,65 --> 0:13:4,75
You couldn't.


377
0:13:4,75 --> 0:13:5,11
EDDY MORETTI: Really?


378
0:13:5,11 --> 0:13:6,54
GEORGE POITRAS: Nobody would
drink the water.


379
0:13:6,54 --> 0:13:9,5
SIMON DYER: If we just look at
the mining perspective, all


380
0:13:9,5 --> 0:13:11,33
these oil sands mines
are either side of


381
0:13:11,33 --> 0:13:12,1
the Athabasca River.


382
0:13:12,1 --> 0:13:16,81
So oil sands companies, oil
sands mines, basically,


383
0:13:16,81 --> 0:13:19,37
extract water directly from
the Athabasca River.


384
0:13:19,37 --> 0:13:24,21
The typical oil sands mine takes
between 2 and 1/2 and 4


385
0:13:24,21 --> 0:13:28,44
barrels of water to extract
one barrel of bitumen.


386
0:13:28,44 --> 0:13:30,59
Because the process, of course,
pollutes that water so


387
0:13:30,59 --> 0:13:33,31
much, it's, largely, not,
actually, returned to the


388
0:13:33,31 --> 0:13:33,79
Athabasca River.


389
0:13:33,79 --> 0:13:35,94
The vast majority of
it gets dumped into


390
0:13:35,94 --> 0:13:37,46
these tailings ponds.


391
0:13:37,46 --> 0:13:41,76
So these are, basically, oily
lagoons full of waste water


392
0:13:41,76 --> 0:13:44,17
and suspended hydrocarbons.


393
0:13:44,17 --> 0:13:48,9
The working hypothesis is that,
you know, the portion of


394
0:13:48,9 --> 0:13:50,54
that tailings is thickened,
and incorporated into the


395
0:13:50,54 --> 0:13:53,21
terrestrial reclaimed
landscape.


396
0:13:53,21 --> 0:13:54,91
LINDSAY TELFER: We're starting
to get more information on the


397
0:13:54,91 --> 0:13:55,53
health effects.


398
0:13:55,53 --> 0:13:57,59
I mean, the thing with health
effects is that it's long


399
0:13:57,59 --> 0:13:58,63
term, right.


400
0:13:58,63 --> 0:14:2,44
They often come after too much
development, and so what we're


401
0:14:2,44 --> 0:14:5,76
seeing, now, are some very clear
signs that there are


402
0:14:5,76 --> 0:14:8,36
downstream health effects.


403
0:14:8,36 --> 0:14:9,41
EDDY MORETTI: Who's
being affected?


404
0:14:9,41 --> 0:14:11,7
LINDSAY TELFER: The First
Nations communities.


405
0:14:11,7 --> 0:14:16,48
PAT MARCEL: This is a
huge experiment, and


406
0:14:16,48 --> 0:14:19,9
I warned the companies.


407
0:14:19,9 --> 0:14:23,97
I said, "what looks bad in
eastern Canada, might look


408
0:14:23,97 --> 0:14:28,21
even worse here." Because you're
not only going to kill


409
0:14:28,21 --> 0:14:30,78
the river, you're going
to kill First Nations.


410
0:14:30,78 --> 0:14:33,1
This thing's out of control--


411
0:14:33,1 --> 0:14:36,83
produce, produce, produce,
you know.


412
0:14:36,83 --> 0:14:39,1
And that's where we're going.


413
0:14:39,1 --> 0:14:42,21
Why the mad rush to take
all this oil out?


414
0:14:42,21 --> 0:14:43,1
Take your time.


415
0:14:43,1 --> 0:14:44,3
Develop safely.


416
0:14:44,3 --> 0:14:46,59
Make sure it's sustainable.


417
0:14:46,59 --> 0:14:49,43
Instead of taking it all
out in 40 years,


418
0:14:49,43 --> 0:14:51,65
make it last 200 years.


419
0:14:51,65 --> 0:14:57,65
So it doesn't stop, because
man is greedy.


420
0:14:57,65 --> 0:15:2,97
Man can have a handful of money,
more than what he needs


421
0:15:2,97 --> 0:15:6,355
to survive, but he'll
still want more.


422
0:15:6,355 --> 0:15:11,31



423
0:15:11,31 --> 0:15:13,9
SIMON DYER: We need to
communicate what's going on in


424
0:15:13,9 --> 0:15:13,79
the oil sands.


425
0:15:13,79 --> 0:15:15,95
We need to ensure that
this gets better,


426
0:15:15,95 --> 0:15:17,46
rapidly better, quickly.


427
0:15:17,46 --> 0:15:18,48
We need to ensure there
is a moratorium


428
0:15:18,48 --> 0:15:19,87
until we improve that.


429
0:15:19,87 --> 0:15:21,527
And we need to use this
as a stepping


430
0:15:21,527 --> 0:15:22,98
stone to change things.


431
0:15:22,98 --> 0:15:25,15
America, of course, uses
more than 20 million


432
0:15:25,15 --> 0:15:26,43
barrels of oil a day.


433
0:15:26,43 --> 0:15:27,73
LINDSAY TELFER: Obviously
there's been no plan.


434
0:15:27,73 --> 0:15:29,73
That's why it spiraled
out of control.


435
0:15:29,73 --> 0:15:31,39
Our communities have spiraled
out of control.


436
0:15:31,39 --> 0:15:33,1
Development spiraled
out of control.


437
0:15:33,1 --> 0:15:37,8
PAT MARCEL: I never said I was
against development, but it's


438
0:15:37,8 --> 0:15:39,8
got to be sustainable
development.


439
0:15:39,8 --> 0:15:41,731
So at this fast pace--


440
0:15:41,731 --> 0:15:44,29
you know, development
right now--


441
0:15:44,29 --> 0:15:46,99
we are losing our youth.


442
0:15:46,99 --> 0:15:48,27
ANTHONY: It's absolutely
crazy.


443
0:15:48,27 --> 0:15:50,785
The infrastructure's
not meant for this.


444
0:15:50,785 --> 0:15:52,67
RALPH KLEIN: At some
point, they will


445
0:15:52,67 --> 0:15:56,2
say enough is enough.


446
0:15:56,2 --> 0:15:57,52
We've reached our limits.


447
0:15:57,52 --> 0:15:59,99
There is no room to move.


448
0:15:59,99 --> 0:16:1,97
LINDSAY TELFER: The growing
emissions of the oil sands are


449
0:16:1,97 --> 0:16:4,73
enough to prevent Canada,
single-handedly, from meeting


450
0:16:4,73 --> 0:16:5,95
our Kyoto commitments.


451
0:16:5,95 --> 0:16:8,91
The reality is Canada signed
and ratified Kyoto.


452
0:16:8,91 --> 0:16:9,14
EDDY MORETTI: Mhm.


453
0:16:9,14 --> 0:16:10,22
LINDSAY TELFER: It's
international law.


454
0:16:10,22 --> 0:16:12,73
Whether we like it or not, we
have an obligation to meet it.


455
0:16:12,73 --> 0:16:14,59
The conservative governments
have been backtracking and


456
0:16:14,59 --> 0:16:18,57
backtracking, trying to figure
out a way to get us out of it.


457
0:16:18,57 --> 0:16:19,86
Basically, they said
it's impossible.


458
0:16:19,86 --> 0:16:20,96
They won't do it.


459
0:16:20,96 --> 0:16:23,46
It will trash our economy,
none of which is true.


460
0:16:23,46 --> 0:16:24,17
We can do it.


461
0:16:24,17 --> 0:16:25,46
It won't trash our economy.


462
0:16:25,46 --> 0:16:28,67
Suncor, one of the biggest oil
sands operators, came out just


463
0:16:28,67 --> 0:16:31,27
this week and said, "eh, it
won't trash our economy."


464
0:16:31,27 --> 0:16:32,7
RALPH KLEIN: These oil
companies know--


465
0:16:32,7 --> 0:16:33,2
EDDY MORETTI: Mhm.


466
0:16:33,2 --> 0:16:37,87
RALPH KLEIN: --that they are
going to have to curtail their


467
0:16:37,87 --> 0:16:39,72
emissions of greenhouse gases.


468
0:16:39,72 --> 0:16:41,59
EDDY MORETTI: And eventually
start bringing them down.


469
0:16:41,59 --> 0:16:42,76
RALPH KLEIN: By the year 2020.


470
0:16:42,76 --> 0:16:43,37
EDDY MORETTI: Right


471
0:16:43,37 --> 0:16:45,4
RALPH KLEIN: OK it's a longer
period of time.


472
0:16:45,4 --> 0:16:50,58
It's not 2010 as the
Kyoto protocol--


473
0:16:50,58 --> 0:16:51,9
EDDY MORETTI: --demands
or dictates.


474
0:16:51,9 --> 0:16:52,18
RALPH KLEIN: --dictates.


475
0:16:52,18 --> 0:16:53,53
EDDY MORETTI: Right.


476
0:16:53,53 --> 0:16:55,85
RALPH KLEIN: It's a longer
period of time, but it is


477
0:16:55,85 --> 0:16:57,46
legislated.


478
0:16:57,46 --> 0:17:0,42
SIMON DYER: Canada could meet
its Kyoto commitments by using


479
0:17:0,42 --> 0:17:2,21
a combination of regulations
and incentives


480
0:17:2,21 --> 0:17:3,24
to make this happen.


481
0:17:3,24 --> 0:17:3,5
EDDY MORETTI: Right.


482
0:17:3,5 --> 0:17:5,69
SIMON DYER: For the cost of a
couple of dollars on the cost


483
0:17:5,69 --> 0:17:8,63
of a barrel of oil, companies
could be completely carbon


484
0:17:8,63 --> 0:17:12,54
neutral-- that's have a net zero
greenhouse gas emission


485
0:17:12,54 --> 0:17:15,25
footprint-- because you know,
it's most efficient when you


486
0:17:15,25 --> 0:17:16,46
have large point sources.


487
0:17:16,46 --> 0:17:18,27
And that's what the
oil sands are.


488
0:17:18,27 --> 0:17:20,67
So we have solutions out there,
but we're choosing not


489
0:17:20,67 --> 0:17:21,91
to use them.


490
0:17:21,91 --> 0:17:25,4
LINDSAY TELFER: Alberta,
southern Alberta has the


491
0:17:25,4 --> 0:17:28,71
strongest possibility for solar
and wind in Canada.


492
0:17:28,71 --> 0:17:31,31
Yet we don't have-- we don't
put any money towards it.


493
0:17:31,31 --> 0:17:34,22
And in fact, we capped our wind
energy production at 900


494
0:17:34,22 --> 0:17:34,5
megawatts--


495
0:17:34,5 --> 0:17:35,5
EDDY MORETTI: Smart.


496
0:17:35,5 --> 0:17:36,825
LINDSAY TELFER: --so we couldn't
build anymore.


497
0:17:36,825 --> 0:17:37,22
EDDY MORETTI: Brilliant.


498
0:17:37,22 --> 0:17:42,18
LINDSAY TELFER: So I mean, we
need to be creating that


499
0:17:42,18 --> 0:17:44,92
environment for innovation
within the province.


500
0:17:44,92 --> 0:17:47,1
And I think people want
to see us going there.


501
0:17:47,1 --> 0:17:48,49
I don't think that they want to
see us putting all our eggs


502
0:17:48,49 --> 0:17:50,36
in the oil sands basket.


503
0:17:50,36 --> 0:17:55,52
The community is saying, "no
more." And if the government


504
0:17:55,52 --> 0:17:58,66
doesn't respond, then there's
going to be--


505
0:17:58,66 --> 0:18:0,64
I think that there's going
to be some uprising.


506
0:18:0,64 --> 0:18:3,97
And my question to the Alberta
government has always been, do


507
0:18:3,97 --> 0:18:6,88
we really want to be the final
frontier of a dying resource.


508
0:18:6,88 --> 0:18:8,68
Or do we, actually, want
to be the innovators


509
0:18:8,68 --> 0:18:9,98
of something new.


510
0:18:9,98 --> 0:18:13,51
And I think that we've got the
innovation and the technical


511
0:18:13,51 --> 0:18:16,56
ability and the know-how in this
province to, actually, be


512
0:18:16,56 --> 0:18:18,2
leaders of a new energy
frontier.


513
0:18:18,2 --> 0:20:18,2
