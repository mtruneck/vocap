###6 You know, the hot tub is cool now
###8 But they poisoned it
###9 I know, right… how?
###11 Sing me some harmonies!
###13 It's a small picture in a shop somewhere
###16 And I know who it is!
###18 It's Mormon Judy
###20 And cow people.
###21 A little pitchy
###22 But mmm
###23 Good stuff!
###24 Governor Romney's black
###26 I mean, uh, I think "black" can be judged—
###29 How do I do this?
###30 Dude, I don't have a Jet-Ski…
###32 Not the kind you're talking about.
###34 Plus everyone can see that I'm not black.
###37 I mean, this isn't scientific stuff!
###39 I heard there's not going to be a test!
###42 But I mean, I do want you to support me and be my man…
###45 That's beautiful!
###46 I know he's black…
###48 Ahmed, how did you know about whodunnit in the lounge?
###53 I didn't know.
###54 Oh, you didn't! Oh, oh, well they started clapping
###56 for the mad cow!
###58 Until someone sold him
###61 And then, and then when he died, they had him stuffed!
###64 Like that water buffalo…
###65 Stuffed.
###67 That dude's the sickest.
###68 We hate him.
###69 Because he had eggs for a bath.
###71 Gonna throw up tonight.
###73 Ahhh, but if you throw up
###75 Then it's as a jealous woman.
###78 In horrible weather, I sneeze and I just lose the puppets.
###83 I'm thinking, Governor Romney won't do that, ok?
###85 And this has got me thinking…
###88 I see a purple
###90 idiot
###91 Who speaks German
###92 With a big, spunky, Irish Labradoodle puppy.
###95 Ohh, he got me
###96 And I want you to feel bad
###98 'Cause I've got funny radiation coming up on my desk and it's too much
###101 Ah come on, I'm not a robot, okay.
###102 I wish.
###104 Then I could go higher, and you could rotate my arm
###105 and send me whooshing into space
###107 Can you hear me?
###109 Now Matt, shush, because the sofa bears don't know.
###112 Go ride off, and I'll defeat 17 bears while you're gone
###115 But first I want you two to turn and look at each other.
###119 Yeah.
###121 Oh, now that's nice.
###123 Just stare deeply into each other's eyes.
###125 Yeah.
###127 Good, now say the first thing that pops into your brain!
###129 I don't want to touch sandpaper.
###131 I like "The Wiz"!
###132 Okay, all right
###134 Now I want to try something
###135 Why don't we go, "mmmm"
###136 Just go, "mmmmmmmmm"
###139 "Mmmmmmmmmmmm…."
###140 "Mmmmmmm…"
###141 "Mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm…"
###144 Yeah, ok, good, that's what I want you to do.
###146 Now follow my lead.
###148 I'm jumping in a pimento shower.
###150 I wanted the music first.
###152 In the tragic square of the Fresh Prince
###155 There went a perfect brown baby.
###158 The guards can see we're all out of weapons, no machetes
###162 Lotion raw bruises
###165 Lotion raw bruises.
###168 Drink
###169 Or sip
###170 A wench
###171 At our hotel
###172 Wolf government
###173 Anchovies
###174 When they laugh at you, you'll drown
###176 Eye of the Sparrow
###179 This girl slipped on my arrow.
###183 
###184 I love you two, okay?
###187 Now I want you to turn and look at me.
###189 [snoring sounds]
###190 Ahmed?
###193 Yeah
###194 Uhhh, he's asleep…
###195 Ah! Oh!
###197 It's party time, chumps!
###199 Drink! [Drink!]
###200 Or sip! [Sip!]
###201 A wench at our hotel!
###203 Wolf government!
###204 Anchovies!
###205 If they laugh at you, you'll drown!
###208 Eye of the Sparrow!
###209 Eye of the Sparrow!
###210 That girl slipped on my arrow!
###214 Drink!
###215 Or sip!
###216 Anchovies!
###217 GO!
