1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:3,451



2
0:0:3,451 --> 0:0:4,701
LIZARD KING: No.


3
0:0:4,701 --> 0:0:8,381



4
0:0:8,381 --> 0:0:10,353
[LAUGHING].


5
0:0:10,353 --> 0:0:14,79



6
0:0:14,79 --> 0:0:15,283
Oh!


7
0:0:15,283 --> 0:0:18,241
[LAUGHING].


8
0:0:18,241 --> 0:0:20,213
That's what Mike was
talking about.


9
0:0:20,213 --> 0:0:21,463
[LAUGHING].


10
0:0:21,463 --> 0:0:26,129



11
0:0:26,129 --> 0:0:27,115
FEMALE SPEAKER: Kick your ass.


12
0:0:27,115 --> 0:0:28,101
LIZARD KING: Ha ha!


13
0:0:28,101 --> 0:0:29,351
Did you just see that?


14
0:0:29,351 --> 0:0:32,57



15
0:0:32,57 --> 0:0:33,63
DON NGUYEN: Can't stand still.


16
0:0:33,63 --> 0:0:35,53
He just has to keep
moving and shit.


17
0:0:35,53 --> 0:0:39,27
Yeah, he's always been the
same-- super fucking hyper.


18
0:0:39,27 --> 0:0:41,18
ANDREW REYNOLDS: Like, out
of everybody on a tour or


19
0:0:41,18 --> 0:0:43,87
something like that, he's
probably up first--


20
0:0:43,87 --> 0:0:48,2
him and Antwuan, but Antwuan's
mellow-- but he's up first and


21
0:0:48,2 --> 0:0:51,3
just jumping and punching near
your face and stuff first


22
0:0:51,3 --> 0:0:54,66
thing from like 8:00 all day
long, until he goes to bed.


23
0:0:54,66 --> 0:0:56,84
I don't know where
he gets it from.


24
0:0:56,84 --> 0:0:58,43
He's just hyped up.


25
0:0:58,43 --> 0:1:5,31
LIZARD KING: [SINGING]


26
0:1:5,31 --> 0:1:8,16
DON NGUYEN: There was 26 fools
rolling in three vans.


27
0:1:8,16 --> 0:1:9,84
MALE SPEAKER: That was nuts.


28
0:1:9,84 --> 0:1:11,51
DON NGUYEN: The sessions that
were going down were


29
0:1:11,51 --> 0:1:12,59
in-fucking-sane.


30
0:1:12,59 --> 0:1:15,0
MALE SPEAKER: Is there like
sober van and wastoid van?


31
0:1:15,0 --> 0:1:19,0
DON NGUYEN: Yeah, there's like
the boss van, the fucking


32
0:1:19,0 --> 0:1:25,39
syrup van, and then our van was
just like, whatever man.


33
0:1:25,39 --> 0:1:29,67
MALE SPEAKER: Do you ever give
Lizard or Antwuan talks about


34
0:1:29,67 --> 0:1:31,782
their drinking, or drugs,
or anything?


35
0:1:31,782 --> 0:1:33,8
JIM GRECO: Yep.


36
0:1:33,8 --> 0:1:33,76
To each his own.


37
0:1:33,76 --> 0:1:34,57
Everybody's different.


38
0:1:34,57 --> 0:1:39,59
Like Dustin, Dustin Dollin, he's
fueled by the alcohol.


39
0:1:39,59 --> 0:1:43,74
But yet it destroys his body,
so that's where it gets him.


40
0:1:43,74 --> 0:1:46,89
But he's invincible
on the alcohol.


41
0:1:46,89 --> 0:1:49,44
Lizard is similar.


42
0:1:49,44 --> 0:1:54,96
Lizard's similar, but he
rips drunk or sober.


43
0:1:54,96 --> 0:1:58,0
He's got a little bit more
common sense than Dustin.


44
0:1:58,0 --> 0:1:59,1
LIZARD KING: Oh,
you're on acid?


45
0:1:59,1 --> 0:2:2,6
He's like, go skate the bowl.


46
0:2:2,6 --> 0:2:4,33
What do you mean, go
skate the bowl?


47
0:2:4,33 --> 0:2:5,885
I'm like, I can't skate
the bowl right now.


48
0:2:5,885 --> 0:2:8,11
I don't want to skate
the bowl right now.


49
0:2:8,11 --> 0:2:8,6
I'm fucked up.


50
0:2:8,6 --> 0:2:10,195
He's like, no, try it.


51
0:2:10,195 --> 0:2:11,525
Let's go test it out.


52
0:2:11,525 --> 0:2:14,84
Went outside, we walked inside,
went to the bowl,


53
0:2:14,84 --> 0:2:17,4
shredded the fuck out
of the bowl, right?


54
0:2:17,4 --> 0:2:19,63
I came back, turned to
him, and was like,


55
0:2:19,63 --> 0:2:21,77
skating on acid is tight.


56
0:2:21,77 --> 0:2:22,96
It's the best shit ever.


57
0:2:22,96 --> 0:2:24,43
JIM GRECO: I just tell him how
it was like for me about


58
0:2:24,43 --> 0:2:25,92
drinking and shit.


59
0:2:25,92 --> 0:2:28,53
That it affects you.


60
0:2:28,53 --> 0:2:29,8
Choices you're making now.


61
0:2:29,8 --> 0:2:35,48
And just to be careful and try
to figure out in your head


62
0:2:35,48 --> 0:2:39,461
what you want to do before
you ruin your chances.


63
0:2:39,461 --> 0:2:40,0
LIZARD KING: He's always
like, dude, I'm


64
0:2:40,0 --> 0:2:40,76
going to pray for you.


65
0:2:40,76 --> 0:2:44,56
I mean, I know you don't want me
to, but I'm going to do it.


66
0:2:44,56 --> 0:2:46,62
He's not into the whole
Satan thing.


67
0:2:46,62 --> 0:2:49,49
I think he thinks of me as a
jinx, maybe, or something.


68
0:2:49,49 --> 0:2:50,94
He's just a nutcase, kind of.


69
0:2:50,94 --> 0:2:54,48
I mean, all of us are
nutcases, but--


70
0:2:54,48 --> 0:2:56,24
MALE SPEAKER: When you're on
death wish, do any of the


71
0:2:56,24 --> 0:2:57,68
other pros like Andrew--


72
0:2:57,68 --> 0:3:0,235
like, some of the older dudes,
do they ever give you pep


73
0:3:0,235 --> 0:3:1,96
talks or coach talks?


74
0:3:1,96 --> 0:3:2,77
LIZARD KING: Yeah, yeah.


75
0:3:2,77 --> 0:3:8,99
Sometimes like how if I got
sober, how much better I'd be


76
0:3:8,99 --> 0:3:11,176
at skating, and fucking--


77
0:3:11,176 --> 0:3:13,79
a bunch of shit, and how I'm
a drug addict and shit.


78
0:3:13,79 --> 0:3:15,6
I think it's pretty funny.


79
0:3:15,6 --> 0:3:18,27
That's all we do, pretty much,
shit is pretty funny.


80
0:3:18,27 --> 0:3:20,8
But then the older guys are
all sober and shit.


81
0:3:20,8 --> 0:3:23,33
Well, not all off them,
but, I mean, Shane,


82
0:3:23,33 --> 0:3:26,65
Drew, fucking Jim.


83
0:3:26,65 --> 0:3:28,18
It's kind of weird.


84
0:3:28,18 --> 0:3:32,69
And the best part is they'll
still put footage out that's


85
0:3:32,69 --> 0:3:36,3
really old of them, but it's
of them partying and shit,


86
0:3:36,3 --> 0:3:37,87
just to make the part
more hijinks


87
0:3:37,87 --> 0:3:40,51
and exciting or something.


88
0:3:40,51 --> 0:3:42,64
MALE SPEAKER: You think you'll
eventually quit drinking and


89
0:3:42,64 --> 0:3:43,47
be like those dudes?


90
0:3:43,47 --> 0:3:44,7
Go into that rag?


91
0:3:44,7 --> 0:3:44,99
LIZARD KING: Me?


92
0:3:44,99 --> 0:3:46,72
Fuck, I don't know.


93
0:3:46,72 --> 0:3:48,44
I probably should.


94
0:3:48,44 --> 0:3:50,3
But I'm kind of like, I
like being a pile of


95
0:3:50,3 --> 0:3:51,55
shit, though, you know?


96
0:3:51,55 --> 0:3:53,72



97
0:3:53,72 --> 0:3:55,67
We should make another cruiser
board that's like


98
0:3:55,67 --> 0:3:56,84
a AA meeting directory.


99
0:3:56,84 --> 0:3:58,34
MALE SPEAKER: [LAUGH].


100
0:3:58,34 --> 0:4:1,34
And when you get sober, you
get the sobriety cruiser.


101
0:4:1,34 --> 0:4:3,585
It's like the AA book.


102
0:4:3,585 --> 0:4:5,49
[LAUGHTER].


103
0:4:5,49 --> 0:4:7,33
LIZARD KING: Isn't that
like, 8 o'clock,


104
0:4:7,33 --> 0:4:10,98
Tuesday, fucking pep talk.


105
0:4:10,98 --> 0:4:12,23
That would be fucking
hilarious.


106
0:4:12,23 --> 0:6:12,23
