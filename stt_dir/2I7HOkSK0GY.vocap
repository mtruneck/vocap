###0 THOMAS MARTIN (OFFSCREEN): Hi, I'm Baby Balls.
###2 My bosses think I'm a nerd, so they like to send me to live
###4 with different people to figure out
###5 what they're all about.
###7 Anyway this is that.
###9 It's called Balls Deep.
###10 ANNOUNCER (OFFSCREEN): How's everybody doing?
###12 [CROWD CHEERS]
###15 ANNOUNCER (OFFSCREEN): Everybody get to your seats.
###16 It's time now for [INAUDIBLE] fight night nine.
###20 THOMAS MARTIN: Hi, I'm Thomas Martin, with VBS, and we're
###22 going go meet up with Matt Ruskin who is a mixed martial
###25 arts fighter who's training for a big cage
###28 match down in Georgia.
###30 We're going to follow him through his routine and see if
###32 I can keep up, try not to get my ass kicked and then go
###35 enjoy a fight.
###37 Mixed martial arts, or MMA, is the official name of what's
###40 usually called Ultimate Fighting.
###42 There's a small set of rules to keep anyone from getting
###44 killed, like you can't gouge his eyes out or attack their
###47 groin, but otherwise it's just two guys in shorts whaling on
###51 each other until one is knocked out or gives up.
###53 It's basically the closest sports come to an actual
###56 street brawl.
###58 MMA has grown into one of the most popular
###59 new sports in America.
###60 Matt is a relative newcomer to the sport.
###62 He's got a few matches under his belt but is still
###64 struggling to make a name for himself.
###66 We're here in midtown Manhattan at the Gracie
###69 Academy and we're going to go meet up with Matt.
###72 Do we need to take off our shoes?
###73 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Yeah.
###74 THOMAS MARTIN: I kind of wish I didn't wear my fucking like
###76 candy land fucking socks.
###78 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): You're going to train too.
###80 ROB: You're what?
###81 THOMAS MARTIN: I'm going to train--
###83 ROB: Those are the prettiest socks on a man I've ever seen.
###85 I don't think I want to train with you with those cute
###87 little socks.
###88 [LAUGHTER]
###89 ROB: I might just want to snuggle up on the mat with you
###91 and hold you real tight.
###92 Cute little thing, you.
###94 MALE SPEAKER: Come on, let's go get changed up.
###95 Grab your stuff.
###99 THOMAS MARTIN: In the pro leagues like the UFC and IFL,
###101 the winnings can get up to hundreds of thousands of
###103 dollars, but where Matt is at right now, all his time and
###106 money go into his training.
###108 If he wins this fight he stands to
###110 pocket a whopping $300.
###112 MATT RUSKIN: I weigh in four weeks from today.
###114 Fight night is four weeks from tommorow, and I have until
###116 right before I step in that cage to be 171.
###120 THOMAS MARTIN (OFFSCREEN): The weight class system is like
###121 institutionalized cheating.
###123 It's supposed to prevent unfair matches but what
###125 happens is the bigger dudes just starve themselves down to
###128 the lowest class they can, then put all the weight back
###130 on the day of the fight.
###131 MATT RUSKIN: Right now we're at right below 187.
###135 So we got about 16 pounds to go.
###139 THOMAS MARTIN: How often do you do the Jiu-jitsu versus
###141 everything else?
###142 MATT RUSKIN: Try to even everything out about two, two
###144 three days a week for boxing, two to
###145 three days a week Jiu-jitsu.
###147 MMA is, is mixture of games.
###149 If you're a submission grappler then obviously your,
###152 your goal is to get the fight to the
###153 floor as quick as possible.
###155 Or if you're more of a striker you know, you want to, to keep
###157 the fight standing up.
###159 I'm more a ground and pound.
###161 My submissions aren't that great but if I get you on the
###163 ground hold a position and just start blasting--
###166 THOMAS MARTIN: That's a good technique.
###167 MATT RUSKIN: Yeah.
###167 THOMAS MARTIN: It's like a, like a traditional school
###169 fighting technique.
###170 MATT RUSKIN: Uh-huh.
###172 CARL: The position that Julio is in on the bottom
###175 is called the guard.
###176 He's still in kind of neutral position.
###178 The man on the top is trying to get past his legs so he
###181 gets more of a dominant position.
###183 If you feel pain or if you feel like you're going to pass
###186 out from a choke--
###187 [TAPS THE MAT]
###187 just do that.
###188 That means--
###189 It's kind of like saying uncle.
###191 We'll just go from here.
###192 We'll just roll and try to make each other say uncle.
###195 THOMAS MARTIN: I have no idea what I'm doing.
###198 [GRUNTS IN PAIN]
###202 CARL: If you pain just tap.
###205 THOMAS MARTIN: Despite looking like two dudes humping on a
###207 mat, Jiu-Jitsu is really mentally involved.
###209 You have to remain fully aware of what each of you limbs and
###213 each of your opponent's limbs are doing at all times while
###216 planning what they're all going to be doing five moves
###218 down the road.
###220 Ow!
###221 [INAUDIBLE]
###221 CARL: You alright?
###222 THOMAS MARTIN: Yeah.
###223 It's not about having like holds or anything like, in
###225 like wrestling whatever, it's like--
###227 CARL: Oh, there are about--
###227 THOMAS MARTIN: It's like pain.
###229 CARL: Litterally, the idea is that it
###230 will destroy the joint.
###232 THOMAS MARTIN: Uh-huh.
###233 CARL: Right here is pressure on the joint.
###236 If you don't give up I'm going to probably pop the capsule on
###240 your elbow.
###241 THOMAS MARTIN (OFFSCREEN): Do all MMA fights end
###243 with a knock out?
###244 MATT RUSKIN: Knock out, submission, verbal submission,
###247 versus a tap out--
###248 THOMAS MARTIN (OFFSCREEN): Yeah, OK.
###248 MATT RUSKIN: The referee can stop it.
###250 In case somebody is getting too much punishment they can
###253 directly step in and end the fight.
###255 If you get a cut over the eye and blood is pouring into your
###257 face, you can't see, they're going to, they're
###260 going to stop it.
###261 The other way to win is by decision.
###263 Let's say it goes three rounds and it goes to the judges and
###265 they score, score a decision.
###269 MALE SPEAKER: He's doing fine.
###270 I mean he could be ready in four weeks I think.
###273 MALE SPEAKER: Thank you.
###273 THOMAS MARTIN: Thanks again man.
###274 MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]
###274 MALE SPEAKER: Next week.
###275 THOMAS MARTIN: Alright.
###275 Hey Rob.
###276 Thanks for uh--
###278 ROB: No problem my man, no problem.
###281 Is he crazy?
###282 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): [LAUGHTER]
###283 ROB: What's wrong with him?
###284 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): [INAUDIBLE]
###285 THOMAS MARTIN: No, it's not working.
###286 ROB: Man, I've got shoes bigger than you.
###288 You better get the fuck off me man.
###291 MATT RUSKIN: Right now we are on Saint Mark's Boulevard in
###294 Staten Island and we're heading back to my house.
###298 I'm going to drop my stuff off and then start running.
###301 
###304 It's like a locker room.
###305 It serves the purpose.
###307 THOMAS MARTIN: Got a nice little mantle.
###309 MATT RUSKIN: Vitamins, laundry, vitamins, Jack
###313 Daniels, supplements.
###314 THOMAS MARTIN: Gamma O?
###316 MATT RUSKIN: It's a testosterone booster.
###319 It heals your body a lot quicker so we can keep the
###321 intensity of the workouts up.
###323 Without that stuff, or without any kind of supplements you
###325 have to take obviously, like, days off to recover from a
###328 really, really, intense workout.
###331 This is the best invention ever for somebody that is
###334 trying to diet and cut weight.
###335 THOMAS MARTIN (OFFSCREEN): Eating is the biggest part of
###337 the training.
###337 MATT RUSKIN: This is what it makes.
###338 THOMAS MARTIN: Aw sweet.
###339 THOMAS MARTIN (OFFSCREEN): You're basically on the South
###340 Beach diet for a month while spending all your energy
###344 working out every day.
###345 It makes you constantly pissed off, which is good for the
###347 fight, but not so awesome for hanging out with buds or
###350 trying to keep a girlfriend.
###351 MATT RUSKIN: When I'm not cutting weight I mean I'll,
###353 I'll eat a lot more obvious than this.
###355 THOMAS MARTIN: Well what do you normally do on like a
###357 night like this?
###357 Just come back and--
###358 MATT RUSKIN: A night like this I'll come back.
###361 I usually cook Tuesdays and Thursdays, I do some sprints.
###366 Usually every night before I go to bed is usually on phone.
###369 Talk to my girlfriend for a few hours.
###371 And I just tell her about the day and everything, and
###373 that's about it.
###374 Wake up do it all again tommorow.
###378 Yeah, he's going to come around with me.
###379 
###382 Alright, I'm about to give him a goo energy gell.
###386 Here take that.
###387 THOMAS MARTIN: Banana blitz, [INAUDIBLE]
###390 acid--
###391 MATT RUSKIN: Oh my-- would you stop?
###392 Cheers!
###393 THOMAS MARTIN: Here we go.
###393 Cheers!
###394 Oh, just take it all down?
###397 It's like frosting.
###399 Let's get ramp up and go fucking sprinting.
###402 I don't have to go do this in a rubber, rubber suit like the
###405 one you're wearing.
###406 MATT RUSKIN: No, this is just good to get used to running in
###409 this getting, getting a good sweat going.
###411 Ready?
###412 THOMAS MARTIN: Yep.
###412 Alright, we're just going?
###413 
###416 Do you do running punches ever?
###418 Or is that a no?
###419 That's just for showboaters?
###421 MATT RUSKIN: What we're going for now is recovery time.
###423 What we're looking for is the time it takes to go from
###426 sprinting a hundred yards to jogging when you're
###428 [PANTS HEAVILY]
###430 to [BREATHES CALMLY]
###430 THOMAS MARTIN: Back to--
###431 MATT RUSKIN: Back to normal breathing patterns, that's
###432 your recovery time.
###434 Once that time drops like--
###435 You can recover in like maybe 10 seconds five seconds, then
###439 you're in shape.
###440 THOMAS MARTIN: Alright.
###441 Fuck!
###444 He's long gone.
###445 
###454 So it's going to go up, this is just the first week?
###456 Yeah, by uh next week we're going to do two, and if you
###459 can do four five minute rounds of sprints
###463 you're in good shape.
###463 THOMAS MARTIN (OFFSCREEN): You can fight a man?
###465 MATT RUSKIN: Yeah.
###465 MATT RUSKIN: Alright.
###466 
###469 Today w'ere down in Dumbo down by the Brooklyn Bridge at
###473 Gleason's gym we're going to go to, uh, Matt Ruskin's
###475 boxing training.
###477 It's been a few days since I did the, the
###479 sprints with math.
###480 I've been trying to just keep up some sort of health regimen
###483 versus my usual lying on the couch at tonight.
###487 This is kind of an old, old school traditional boxing gym.
###491 Matt described it to me as a prison yard up there, so I was
###495 careful not to wear like rainbow colored socks.
###498 Hey Matt how are you?
###500 MATT RUSKIN: Thomas this is Mike.
###500 MIKE SMITH: How are you doing Mike?
###502 THOMAS MARTIN: Alright.
###503 MIKE SMITH: You see the bell?
###504 THOMAS MARTIN: No.
###505 MIKE SMITH: You see the bell up there.
###506 THOMAS MARTIN: Yeah.
###506 MIKE SMITH: It's like the red light, green
###507 light, the yellow light.
###509 Red light means rest, green light means go.
###511 [BUZZER SOUNDS]
###515 THOMAS MARTIN: Ah fuck.
###516 MATT RUSKIN: Don't jump way up in the air.
###517 Just allow enough room to for the rope to
###519 move under your feet.
###520 
###523 THOMAS MARTIN: There we go.
###526 MATT RUSKIN: See you're not too bad.
###527 THOMAS MARTIN: Oh!
###528 MIKE SMITH: Stop anybody in the gym, I've got an open
###530 challenge to anybody in the gym.
###531 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): I'll fight him right now!
###532 MIKE SMITH: This guy right here [INAUDIBLE]
###534 anybody, open challenge.
###536 We've been training Matt for a while for the stand up, for
###539 the stand up portion, there's a boxing portion.
###542 THOMAS MARTIN (OFFSCREEN): Uh-huh.
###542 MIKE SMITH: You know, try to tighten up his hands, because
###544 MMA you have to know a little bit of everything.
###546 Now I got a little Jiu-Jitsu, good wrestler, decent boxer.
###549 That's what makes this sport so interesting and uh, hard,
###554 because you got to know a little bit of everything.
###555 
###558 THOMAS MARTIN (OFFSCREEN): Mike is going to be the guy in
###559 Matt's corner for this match.
###562 He'll be the one mopping up his sweat and blood between
###563 rounds and whispering strategies into his ear like
###568 fuck him up good and hit him in the face.
###570 
###577 Boxing is a really good time I liked it a
###578 lot more than jujitsu.
###579 It felt like real fighting rather than some sort of weird
###582 body chess.
###584 I suppose that makes me more of a striker than a floor man.
###587 All the accounting grunting and sweating totally cranks up
###590 your testosterone I was started getting pumped up to
###592 kick some ass, which I guess is how Matt must
###594 feel all the time.
###596 MATT RUSKIN: The weight, the weight is slowly coming off.
###598 THOMAS MARTIN: So what are you what are you at?
###600 MATT RUSKIN: Right now, about 184.
###602 THOMAS MARTIN: Is that good?
###603 Are you on track?
###604 MATT RUSKIN: We're on track.
###605 I'm exhausted.
###606 
###613 THOMAS MARTIN: What have you got qued up?
###615 This is you?
###615 MATT RUSKIN (OFFSCREEN): This is the video from, from the
###617 last fight.
###617 I mean, you're walking into a cage and they're going to lock
###620 the door and it's going to be you and some other guy trying
###623 to kill each other for the next potentially 12 minutes.
###627 It didn't really know what to expect of this kid.
###629 He came out pretty aggressive, I was like fuck it, take him
###632 down where I feel comfortable.
###634 He was clamped on their pretty good.
###635 And this is where I raise up.
###638 THOMAS MARTIN (OFFSCREEN): [INAUDIBLE]
###638 MATT RUSKIN (OFFSCREEN): Boom, Boom!
###639 THOMAS MARTIN (OFFSCREEN): Ooooh!
###640 MATT RUSKIN (OFFSCREEN): Three clean shots
###642 landed to the face.
###642 I think one of those knocked his tooth lose.
###644 Gave him some him some more hard shots.
###647 [LAUGHS]
###650 MATT RUSKIN (OFFSCREEN): Yeah I guess that--
###651 There you get the tap and over.
###656 That was a good win.
###657 Best feeling in the world.
###660 MATT RUSKIN (OFFSCREEN): MMA emerged in the US
###661 in the early '90s.
###662 Originally the idea was to pair up different schools of
###665 fighting to see which was the best.
###667 Like, who would win between a boxer and a karate guy.
###670 Over time, as folks figured out what moves did and didn't
###673 work, a uniform fighting style developed.
###676 Since the early days MMA has been plagued by controversy
###678 over its supposed brutality.
###680 MATT RUSKIN: Fighting has been around forever.
###682 People like to watch a fight.
###684 It appeals to to our human instincts.
###687 A fight could break out in a basketball game, a fight could
###688 break out in hockey.
###690 Any sport you know when you've got guys competing there's a
###694 potential for a fight.
###696 We just cut through the games and just
###698 get down to the fight.
###699 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Get the hooks in!
###701 
###706 MATT RUSKIN: Dana White, the president, of the UFC brought
###708 up a great point.
###709 What's more brutal than the NFL?
###712 300 pound guys colliding into each other, you know breaking
###715 bones all the time.
###716 
###720 You know the whole point of boxing is you're trying to
###722 knock somebody out.
###723 The whole point of mixed martial arts is you are trying
###724 to beat them in a fight, however your style is.
###727 You can get knocked out in boxing get up, get knocked out
###730 again, get up, get knocked out again.
###732 Mixed martial arts you get clipped-- in my second fight I
###735 got clipped.
###736 I was dazed.
###737 I mean I don't think I was out for more than a few seconds,
###740 but they stopped it so I wouldn't take any more
###743 unneccesary punishment.
###744 But there's always someone out there better than you.
###748 Some Iraq pictures.
###750 Fuckin' weapons cache we found one day.
###753 RPGs, RPKs, AKs, all that shit.
###757 My first boxing match ever.
###759 THOMAS MARTIN (OFFSCREEN): That guy's bicep is like
###761 bigger than like both my legs.
###762 MATT RUSKIN: Yeah, he was a big mother fucker.
###765 Bing.
###766 THOMAS MARTIN (OFFSCREEN): You get in your ow licks?
###768 MATT RUSKIN (OFFSCREEN): Yeah, I got in my own licks.
###769 We, we fought to a, to a draw.
###772 THOMAS MARTIN: I can only imagine this
###773 in the fucking desert.
###774 MATT RUSKIN (OFFSCREEN): [LAUGHS]
###775 Fucking microwave is what is.
###777 THOMAS MARTIN: Yeah?
###778 MATT RUSKIN: You get a mix of everybody in this sport.
###780 When you sit down with a bunch of guys after one of these
###783 events and you really get their stories these are all
###787 working guys.
###788 One guy may be a plumber.
###790 One guy, hey, I'm a cop, I work as a personal trainer.
###793 You look at, at boxing years ago, like high level
###797 pro-boxers used to have a second job.
###799 I train people during the day.
###802 I'm either training for a fight or training people.
###803 I really don't have any spare time.
###807 THOMAS MARTIN (OFFSCREEN): The one thing I kept hearing was
###809 how pure MMA is versus other sports.
###812 All the guys seem really sincere, like they're in it
###814 for the love of fighting instead of just
###816 trying to make a living.
###817 I'm sure as it gets bigger and more money comes in it'll
###819 start attracting the douchebags, but right now it
###822 feels like it's sort of in its golden age.
###825 So we're on our way to go to a thing called conditioning.
###828 He told me it's going to make him puke, so I'm just assuming
###831 that it's going to make me really fucking puke.
###834 He's stopped off right now to check in and try to buy some
###836 sports drink he likes.
###838 MATT RUSKIN: I got some good stuff for recovery,
###839 rest and all that.
###840 THOMAS MARTIN (OFFSCREEN): Body enhancing chemicals.
###841 
###845 MATT RUSKIN: You can tell I'm really not feeling this today.
###847 
###850 THOMAS MARTIN: I'm exhausted.
###852 MATT RUSKIN: You really haven't seen tired before
###854 you've seen this.
###855 ALAN SPINDELL: We're going to do the fight matrix, where we
###857 do the 15 pound dumbbells, the crosses, the straight punches
###861 and then the down punches.
###862 Baby uppecuts, wider
###864 uppercuts, and turning uppercuts.
###865 THOMAS MARTIN (OFFSCREEN): I'm already completely lost.
###868 Then we'll go to explosives.
###869 ALAN SPINDELL: One, Two, [INAUDIBLE]
###872 One, two--
###874 Then Kettle Bells- Come up, snap your hips up--
###877 All these moves are Jiu-Jitsu based--
###879 hammer throws, stradled, right hand dominatnt.
###884 Boom, control.
###886 THOMAS MARTIN: Can he add a few more elements?
###887 This is a ten pound weighted vest.
###890 THOMAS MARTIN: Oh great.
###891 Matt does this course twice a week at a local high school.
###894 It's basically a Looney Tunes workout.
###896 ALAN SPINDELL: Russian Twist, over unders.
###898 MATT RUSKIN (OFFSCREEN): He kind of reminded me of like Al
###901 Brooks's really enthusiastic sports cousin.
###904 ALAN SPINDELL: Blast, blast them.
###906 Boom, boom, boom.
###907 THOMAS MARTIN: OK, I totally zoned out when he was about
###909 half way through those 30 or 40 different steps, so I'll
###915 just follow what Matt does.
###916 ALAN SPINDELL: Grab your balls and let's get going.
###919 
###929 MARIO: Uh Matt [INAUDIBLE]
###932 usually [INAUDIBLE]
###934 die.
###935 TENAISHA: Yeah.
###936 MARIO: And he was right next to me all the way.
###938 
###969 TENAISHA: He promised to take it easy but
###971 he look like he's--
###972 MARIO: Going to throw up.
###973 TENAISHA: Yeah.
###975 
###981 THOMAS MARTIN: [GRUNTING WITH EXERTION]
###992 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): You're right there, you're two
###993 steps away, let's go.
###995 Alright good.
###996 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Round two!
###997 Ready for another one?
###998 THOMAS MARTIN: That's, that's that's the warm up.
###1001 The real workout consists of running up and down eight
###1003 flights of stairs while carrying a 10 pound weight
###1006 then jumping on a treadmill at full speed and sprinting for
###1008 20 seconds, then doing a whole suite of weightlifting and
###1011 these weird rope pull-ups, and then you do the whole thing
###1014 two more times.
###1015 It's easily the most exercise I've ever done in my life.
###1019 I feel like I'm in an alternate state right now.
###1023 I feel like I'm peaking on shrooms.
###1025 My body feels totally alien to me.
###1028 
###1032 Oh good Matt's barfing.
###1035 I feel bad that I didn't but I feel bad enough.
###1040 I'll see you uh, next week have a good weekend--
###1043 MATT RUSKIN: Take care man.
###1044 THOMAS MARTIN: Rest.
###1045 MATT RUSKIN: Ah, later.
###1046 THOMAS MARTIN: I kind of cut corners.
###1048 Um it was slighty painful but everybody, everybody
###1050 was nice about it.
###1052 I can feel, I can feel in my muscles at the moment that
###1055 within four or five hours I'm going to be
###1057 sorer than I ever have.
###1060 And uh, right now I'm just going to go get some, some
###1062 fucking cytomax and see if I can chill before
###1066 the pain sets in.
###1067
