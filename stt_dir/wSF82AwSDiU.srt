1
0:0:7,497 --> 0:0:9,138
Inspired by the last talker


2
0:0:9,138 --> 0:0:12,983
I'm gonna have a little song 
about Internet porn.


3
0:0:12,983 --> 0:0:15,515
No, just kidding.


4
0:0:15,515 --> 0:0:19,62
The widespread use of Internet porn
is one of the fastes moving


5
0:0:19,62 --> 0:0:23,749
most global experiment ever 
unconsciously conducted.


6
0:0:23,749 --> 0:0:30,72
Nearly every young guy with Internet access 
becomes an eager test subject.


7
0:0:30,72 --> 0:0:32,459
Canadian researcher 
Simon Lajeunesse found


8
0:0:32,459 --> 0:0:36,327
that most boys 
seek pornography by age 10.


9
0:0:36,327 --> 0:0:41,338
Driven by a brain that is suddenly 
fascinated by sex.


10
0:0:41,338 --> 0:0:45,134
Now, users perceive Internet porn 
as far more compelling


11
0:0:45,134 --> 0:0:48,48
than porn of the past. 
Why is that?


12
0:0:48,48 --> 0:0:50,68
Unending novelty.


13
0:0:50,68 --> 0:0:52,379
In this Australian experiment,


14
0:0:52,379 --> 0:0:57,882
it's not mere nudity but novelty 
that gets arousals skyrocketing.


15
0:0:57,882 --> 0:1:1,567
Subjects watch 22 porn displays.
See that spike?


16
0:1:1,567 --> 0:1:6,782
That's where searchers switch to porn
the guys hadn't seen before.


17
0:1:6,782 --> 0:1:11,705
What happened?
The erections in their brains fired up.


18
0:1:11,705 --> 0:1:13,499
Why all the excitement?


19
0:1:13,499 --> 0:1:17,421
Mother nature likes to keep 
a male fertilizing willing females


20
0:1:17,421 --> 0:1:19,942
as long as any 
new ones are around.


21
0:1:19,942 --> 0:1:22,393
In that top line the ram,


22
0:1:22,393 --> 0:1:28,283
he needs more and more time 
to make with the same old you.


23
0:1:28,283 --> 0:1:37,3
But if you keep switching females
-- the bottom line -- well she's not the same.


24
0:1:37,3 --> 0:1:43,617
He can get the job done in 2 minutes flat 
and keep going until he's utterly exhausted.


25
0:1:43,617 --> 0:1:46,445
This is known 
as the Coolidge effect.


26
0:1:46,445 --> 0:1:51,324
Without the Coolidge effect 
there would be no Internet porn.


27
0:1:51,324 --> 0:1:54,886
This old mammalian program 
the Coolidge effect perceives


28
0:1:54,886 --> 0:2:2,159
each novel female on a guy's screen 
as a genetic opportunity.


29
0:2:2,159 --> 0:2:6,52
To keep a guy fertilizing 
the screen his brain releases


30
0:2:6,52 --> 0:2:11,835
the "go get it" neurochemical dopamine
for each novel made or image.


31
0:2:11,835 --> 0:2:13,8
Eventually the ram will tire


32
0:2:13,8 --> 0:2:15,587
but as long as 
the guy can keep clicking


33
0:2:15,587 --> 0:2:18,742
he can keep going 
as so will his dopamine.


34
0:2:18,742 --> 0:2:22,826
With internet porn a guy can see 
more hot babes in 10 minutes


35
0:2:22,826 --> 0:2:27,459
than his ancestors could see 
in several lifetimes.


36
0:2:27,459 --> 0:2:31,342
The problem is he has 
a hunter-gather brain.


37
0:2:31,342 --> 0:2:37,523
A heavy user brain rewires 
itself to this genetic bonanza


38
0:2:37,523 --> 0:2:44,287
so it carefully becomes associated
with this porn harem.


39
0:2:44,287 --> 0:2:48,698
Such behaviours that are associated 
with this are being alone,


40
0:2:48,698 --> 0:2:52,25
voyeurism, clicking, 
searching, multiple tabs


41
0:2:52,25 --> 0:2:57,295
fast-forwarding, constant novelty shock 
and surprise.


42
0:2:57,295 --> 0:2:59,95
As one young guy once asked:


43
0:2:59,95 --> 0:3:4,415
Are we the first generation 
to masturbate left handed?


44
0:3:4,415 --> 0:3:9,48
Now, real sex, in contrast,
is courtship, touching,


45
0:3:9,48 --> 0:3:13,669
being touched, smells, pheromones, 
emotional connection,


46
0:3:13,669 --> 0:3:17,31
interaction with a real person.


47
0:3:17,31 --> 0:3:23,435
Now, what happens when our guy
finally gets with a real mate.


48
0:3:23,435 --> 0:3:26,614
Well, researchers don't know 
much about the effects


49
0:3:26,614 --> 0:3:29,644
of Internet porn for several reasons.


50
0:3:29,644 --> 0:3:34,774
In 2009, when Lajeunesse 
tried to study porn'’s impact


51
0:3:34,774 --> 0:3:39,717
he couldn't find any college age males 
who weren't using it.


52
0:3:39,717 --> 0:3:45,659
So the first serious dilemma is
that studies have no control groups.


53
0:3:45,659 --> 0:3:48,973
Now, this creates a huge blind spot.


54
0:3:48,973 --> 0:3:52,852
Imagine if all guys
started smoking at age 10


55
0:3:52,852 --> 0:3:55,122
and there were no groups 
that didn't.


56
0:3:55,122 --> 0:3:59,89
We would think that lung cancer 
is normal for all guys.


57
0:3:59,89 --> 0:4:5,898
Undaunted by his lack of non-users 
Lajeunesse asked 20 male students:


58
0:4:5,898 --> 0:4:11,185
Is Internet porn affecting you 
or your attitude towards women?


59
0:4:11,185 --> 0:4:14,353
They answered: 
"No, I don't think so."


60
0:4:14,353 --> 0:4:19,186
But they've been using it for about decade 
then pretty much non-stop.


61
0:4:19,186 --> 0:4:24,361
This is like asking a fish 
what it thinks about water?


62
0:4:24,361 --> 0:4:26,892
Which bring us to a second problem.


63
0:4:26,892 --> 0:4:31,331
Researchers haven't asked porn users 
about the symptoms


64
0:4:31,331 --> 0:4:35,539
Zimbardo described in
"The Demise of Guys."


65
0:4:35,539 --> 0:4:38,25
Arousal addiction symptoms 
are easily mistaken


66
0:4:38,25 --> 0:4:44,37
for a such thing as ADHD, 
social anxiety, depression,


67
0:4:44,37 --> 0:4:50,326
concentration problems, performance anxiety, 
OCD and a host of others.


68
0:4:50,326 --> 0:4:55,745
Now, healthcare providers often assume 
that these conditions are primary


69
0:4:55,745 --> 0:5:1,545
perhaps the cause of addiction but 
never really the result of an addiction.


70
0:5:1,545 --> 0:5:5,943
As a consequence they often 
medicate these guys


71
0:5:5,943 --> 0:5:11,292
without really inquiring about
if they have an Internet addiction.


72
0:5:11,292 --> 0:5:13,958
Guys never realise 
that they could overcome these


73
0:5:13,958 --> 0:5:18,59
symptoms simply 
by changing their behaviour.


74
0:5:18,59 --> 0:5:21,511
Now, the third problem
is it's hard to believe that


75
0:5:21,511 --> 0:5:26,608
sexual activity can cause addiction 
because sex is healthy.


76
0:5:26,608 --> 0:5:28,627
But Internet porn is not sex.


77
0:5:28,627 --> 0:5:32,807
Internet porn is 
as different from real sex


78
0:5:32,807 --> 0:5:36,867
as today’s video games 
are from checkers.


79
0:5:36,867 --> 0:5:39,828
Watching the screen 
full of naked body parts


80
0:5:39,828 --> 0:5:45,212
won't automatically protect one 
from arousal addiction.


81
0:5:45,212 --> 0:5:48,579
In this Dutch study
-- here's the title --


82
0:5:48,579 --> 0:5:53,435
they found that in fact of all activities 
on the Internet


83
0:5:53,435 --> 0:5:57,45
porn has the most potential 
to become addictive.


84
0:5:57,45 --> 0:5:58,216
Here's why.


85
0:5:58,216 --> 0:6:0,618
This ancient programme, 
the reward circuit,


86
0:6:0,618 --> 0:6:4,773
evolved to drive us towards 
natural rewards


87
0:6:4,773 --> 0:6:9,195
such as sex, 
bonding and food.


88
0:6:9,195 --> 0:6:13,482
As a consequence extreme versions
of natural rewards


89
0:6:13,482 --> 0:6:17,747
have a unique ability
to capture us.


90
0:6:17,747 --> 0:6:24,892
For example: high-calorie foods or hot novel babes
give us extra dopamine.


91
0:6:24,892 --> 0:6:30,753
Too much dopamine though can override 
our natural satiation mechanisms.


92
0:6:30,753 --> 0:6:34,18
For example: give rats unlimited access


93
0:6:34,18 --> 0:6:39,228
to junk food and almost all of them 
will binge to obesity.


94
0:6:39,228 --> 0:6:42,665
This is also why 4 out of 5 Americans
are overweight


95
0:6:42,665 --> 0:6:45,201
and about half of those are obese.


96
0:6:45,201 --> 0:6:47,6
That is addicted to food.


97
0:6:47,6 --> 0:6:51,366
Now, in contrast the natural rewards 
drugs such as


98
0:6:51,366 --> 0:6:59,521
cocaine or alcohol only hook about 10% of users
whether they are rats or humans.


99
0:6:59,521 --> 0:7:6,933
This binge mechanism for food or sex
was once an evolutionary advantage.


100
0:7:6,933 --> 0:7:10,381
In essence, it is getting it while 
the getting is good.


101
0:7:10,381 --> 0:7:14,152
Now, you can think of wolves packing 
away 20 pound of meat per kill


102
0:7:14,152 --> 0:7:18,433
or it's mating season 
and you're the alpha male.


103
0:7:18,433 --> 0:7:21,872
What if mating season never ends?


104
0:7:21,872 --> 0:7:26,71
All those hits of dopamine can tell 
your brain to do two things.


105
0:7:26,71 --> 0:7:30,11
First they say: "Man, you've hit 
the evolutionary jackpot."


106
0:7:30,11 --> 0:7:35,745
Second, they kick in a molecular 
switched called Delta-FosB.


107
0:7:35,745 --> 0:7:39,738
I know it is fancy word, 
but dopamine kicks in Delta-FosB


108
0:7:39,738 --> 0:7:44,657
and that starts to accumulate 
in the brain's reward circuit.


109
0:7:44,657 --> 0:7:48,974
Now, with excess chronic consumption 
of drugs or natural rewards,


110
0:7:48,974 --> 0:7:52,969
this build up a Delta-FosB 
starts to alter the brain


111
0:7:52,969 --> 0:7:57,947
and promote the cycle 
of binging and craving.


112
0:7:57,947 --> 0:8:1,217
If the binging continues 
the Delta-FosB builds up


113
0:8:1,217 --> 0:8:4,611
and it can lead to brain changes 
seen in all addicts.


114
0:8:4,611 --> 0:8:8,23
So the dominos 
are excess consumption


115
0:8:8,23 --> 0:8:12,554
excess dopamine,
Delta-FosB, brain changes.


116
0:8:12,554 --> 0:8:16,48
One of the first changes 
is a numbed pleasure response.


117
0:8:16,48 --> 0:8:23,931
It kicks in so everyday pleasures 
really don't satisfy a porn addict.


118
0:8:23,931 --> 0:8:26,741
At the same time other 
physical changes in the brain


119
0:8:26,741 --> 0:8:29,647
make the brain 
hyper-reactive to porn.


120
0:8:29,647 --> 0:8:35,529
Everything else in porn users life is sort of boring,
but porn is super exciting.


121
0:8:35,529 --> 0:8:40,112
Finally his willpower arose 
as it's frontal cortex changes.


122
0:8:40,112 --> 0:8:41,988
I can't emphasize this enough.


123
0:8:41,988 --> 0:8:45,462
All addictions share 
these same brain changes


124
0:8:45,462 --> 0:8:52,32
and the same molecular switch 
that kicks them in -- Delta-FosB.


125
0:8:52,32 --> 0:8:55,2
Now scientists have used 
brain scans to measure


126
0:8:55,2 --> 0:8:57,336
these changes in drug addicts.


127
0:8:57,336 --> 0:9:2,55
Up-here these scans show a reduced 
pleasure response in drug addicts.


128
0:9:2,55 --> 0:9:6,59
These and several other changes 
have also been seen in gambling addicts,


129
0:9:6,59 --> 0:9:13,622
food addicts, very recently in video game addicts
and now in internet addicts.


130
0:9:13,622 --> 0:9:18,947
I apologize for filling up the slide 
with brain studies just notice the dates


131
0:9:18,947 --> 0:9:22,66
but I want you to know
that they exist.


132
0:9:22,66 --> 0:9:27,175
So far all brain research points 
only in one direction.


133
0:9:27,175 --> 0:9:32,78
Constant novelty at the click 
can cause addiction.


134
0:9:32,78 --> 0:9:36,506
We know this because
when scientist examined


135
0:9:36,506 --> 0:9:38,425
former Internet addicts they found


136
0:9:38,425 --> 0:9:42,367
that these brain changes 
were reversing themselves.


137
0:9:42,367 --> 0:9:46,988
Unfortunately, none of these studies
isolate porn users,


138
0:9:46,988 --> 0:9:49,124
but they do include them.


139
0:9:49,124 --> 0:9:51,413
Here's the game changer.


140
0:9:51,413 --> 0:9:55,622
A last we have a group of guys 
who are no longer using Internet porn.


141
0:9:55,622 --> 0:10:1,592
That's right! Heavy users are voluntarily 
giving it up by the thousands.


142
0:10:1,592 --> 0:10:7,35
These guys are the missing control group 
in the great porn experiment.


143
0:10:7,35 --> 0:10:12,285
They're showing experts what changing
one single variable can do.


144
0:10:12,285 --> 0:10:16,442
I called it "The Resurrection of Guys" 
as opposed to "the Demise of Guys."


145
0:10:16,442 --> 0:10:18,722
Now, before I continue 
probably you wanna know


146
0:10:18,722 --> 0:10:23,149
why any porn loving guy 
in his right mind would give it up.


147
0:10:23,149 --> 0:10:27,82
Two words: 
erectile dysfunction.


148
0:10:27,82 --> 0:10:31,737
Internet porn is killing 
young men's sexual performance.


149
0:10:31,737 --> 0:10:35,519
Now, Zimbardo said young guys 
are flaming out with women,


150
0:10:35,519 --> 0:10:39,126
this survey by Italian neurologists confirms


151
0:10:39,126 --> 0:10:45,447
what we have witnessed 
over the last few years.


152
0:10:45,447 --> 0:10:50,182
Sexual enhancement drugs often stop working
for these guys, if they ever did,


153
0:10:50,182 --> 0:10:54,103
because the problem isn’'t 
below the belt where viagra works.


154
0:10:54,103 --> 0:10:56,669
Nor is their problem really psychological.


155
0:10:56,669 --> 0:10:59,489
It's due to physical changes 
in the brain.


156
0:10:59,489 --> 0:11:1,78
Those addiction related changes.


157
0:11:1,78 --> 0:11:6,215
Their numb brains are sending weaker 
and weaker signals to their bananas.


158
0:11:6,215 --> 0:11:10,309
(Laughter)
As doctor Foresta says:


159
0:11:10,309 --> 0:11:13,433
"It starts with lower reactions
to porn's sites.


160
0:11:13,433 --> 0:11:16,391
Then there is 
a general drop in libido,


161
0:11:16,391 --> 0:11:20,815
and in the end it becomes impossible 
to get an erection.


162
0:11:20,815 --> 0:11:23,309
There are 3 take-aways
from this.


163
0:11:23,309 --> 0:11:28,477
First, Foresta is describing 
a classic addiction process


164
0:11:28,477 --> 0:11:31,276
-- gradual desensitization.


165
0:11:31,276 --> 0:11:36,137
Second, Internet porn is qualitatively 
different from playboy.


166
0:11:36,137 --> 0:11:40,769
Widespread youthful ED 
has never been seen before.


167
0:11:40,769 --> 0:11:48,111
And finally ED is often the only symptom 
that gets these guys' attention.


168
0:11:48,111 --> 0:11:52,771
The question is what less symptoms
are they missing?


169
0:11:52,771 --> 0:11:56,793
Most don't figure 
that out until after they quit.


170
0:11:56,793 --> 0:12:0,6
Here's a guy in his late 20s.


171
0:12:0,6 --> 0:12:4,95
"I've been to psychologists and psychiatrists
for the last 8 years...


172
0:12:4,95 --> 0:12:8,86
have been diagnosed with depression, 
severe social anxiety,


173
0:12:8,86 --> 0:12:10,645
severe memory impairment 
and a few others.


174
0:12:10,645 --> 0:12:14,307
Have tried Fexer, Ritalin,
Xanax, Paxil


175
0:12:14,307 --> 0:12:17,764
dropped out at two different colleagues, 
been fired twice,


176
0:12:17,764 --> 0:12:20,849
used pot to calm 
my social anxiety.


177
0:12:20,849 --> 0:12:22,782
I've been approached
by quite a few women


178
0:12:22,782 --> 0:12:25,84
I guess due to my looks and status


179
0:12:25,84 --> 0:12:28,48
but they quickly flew away 
due to my incredible weirdness.


180
0:12:28,48 --> 0:12:32,105
I've been a hardcore porn addict
since age 14.


181
0:12:32,105 --> 0:12:34,547
For the last 2 years 
I've been experimenting


182
0:12:34,547 --> 0:12:38,92
and finally realised 
that porn was an issue.


183
0:12:38,92 --> 0:12:41,434
I stopped it completely 
2 months ago.


184
0:12:41,434 --> 0:12:45,152
It has been very difficult
but so far incredibly worth it.


185
0:12:45,152 --> 0:12:48,973
I've since quit 
my remaining medication.


186
0:12:48,973 --> 0:12:51,541
My anxiety is nonexistent.


187
0:12:51,541 --> 0:12:55,62
My memory and focus are sharper 
than they've ever been.


188
0:12:55,62 --> 0:12:59,215
I feel like a huge "chick magnet" 
and my ED is gone too.


189
0:12:59,215 --> 0:13:5,447
I seriously think I had a rebirth, 
a second chance at life."


190
0:13:5,447 --> 0:13:10,151
This is why pockets of guys are peering
all over the web -- body building sites,


191
0:13:10,151 --> 0:13:14,591
sports sites, pickup artists sites --
wherever men congregate.


192
0:13:14,591 --> 0:13:18,397
In essence, they are seeking 
a neurochemical rebirth.


193
0:13:18,397 --> 0:13:22,365
Here's a group on reddit.com 
who called themselves "Fapstronauts."


194
0:13:22,365 --> 0:13:25,666
Fapping is slang for solo sex,


195
0:13:25,666 --> 0:13:29,494
but what they really mean
is giving up porn.


196
0:13:29,494 --> 0:13:35,986
They've added about 2,000 members 
since I captured this picture a month ago.


197
0:13:35,986 --> 0:13:41,192
This movement to unhook from porn 
is growing rapidly.


198
0:13:41,192 --> 0:13:46,67
In fact, groups are springing up all across
the web and in Europe too.


199
0:13:46,67 --> 0:13:51,356
But there is a bizarre fly 
in the ointment.


200
0:13:51,356 --> 0:13:58,698
Guys in the early 20s aren't regaining 
their erectile health as quickly as older guys.


201
0:13:58,698 --> 0:14:6,134
How can a 50-year-old get his mojo back 
quicker then a 20-something?


202
0:14:6,134 --> 0:14:10,453
The answer, even though older guys 
have been using porn a whole lot longer


203
0:14:10,453 --> 0:14:14,538
they didn't start 
on today’'s Internet porn.


204
0:14:14,538 --> 0:14:17,57
Now, we know 
this is a key variable because


205
0:14:17,57 --> 0:14:20,562
the older guys didn'’t start 
having sexual problems


206
0:14:20,562 --> 0:14:27,664
until after they got 
high-speed Internet. (Laughter)


207
0:14:27,664 --> 0:14:31,781
Now, today'’s young teens 
start on high-speed Internet


208
0:14:31,781 --> 0:14:37,65
when their brains are at their peek 
of dopamine production and neuroplasticity.


209
0:14:37,65 --> 0:14:43,926
This is also when they are the most vulnerable
to addiction, but there is another risk.


210
0:14:43,926 --> 0:14:47,96
By adulthood teens strengthen 
heavily used circuits


211
0:14:47,96 --> 0:14:49,425
and prune back unused ones.


212
0:14:49,425 --> 0:14:56,47
So, by age 22 or so a guy's sexual taste
can be like deep roots in his brain.


213
0:14:56,47 --> 0:15:1,936
This can cause panic if a guy has escalated
to extreme porn


214
0:15:1,936 --> 0:15:6,96
or porn that no longer matches 
his sexual orientation.


215
0:15:6,96 --> 0:15:14,83
Fortunately brains are plastic so his taste 
can revert once he quits porn.


216
0:15:14,83 --> 0:15:17,443
As a guy returns 
to normal sensitivity


217
0:15:17,443 --> 0:15:21,749
his brain looks around for the rewards
it evolve to see


218
0:15:21,749 --> 0:15:25,358
such as friendly interaction 
and of course real mates.


219
0:15:25,358 --> 0:15:29,498
Here's one more example of 
what we hear everyday:


220
0:15:29,498 --> 0:15:33,589
"I feel like the next Sir Isaac Newton 
or Leonardo da Vinci.


221
0:15:33,589 --> 0:15:35,596
Since I quit a month ago, 
I've literally:


222
0:15:35,596 --> 0:15:40,299
started a business, taken up piano, 
been studying French every day,


223
0:15:40,299 --> 0:15:44,366
been programming, drawing,
writing, started managing my finances


224
0:15:44,366 --> 0:15:48,721
and I have more awesome ideas 
than I know what to do with.


225
0:15:48,721 --> 0:15:51,53
My confidence is sky-high.


226
0:15:51,53 --> 0:15:54,346
I already feel like 
I can talk to any girl!


227
0:15:54,346 --> 0:16:0,641
I am the same guy who took 2,5 extra years
to graduate from college


228
0:16:0,641 --> 0:16:3,433
because of procrastination 
and depression."


229
0:16:3,433 --> 0:16:5,749
I'll conclude with a wish:


230
0:16:5,749 --> 0:16:8,234
I'd like to see Zimbardo's guys


231
0:16:8,234 --> 0:16:11,952
who are wiping out and their 
caregivers and the experts


232
0:16:11,952 --> 0:16:15,903
listen to the thousands of men 
who are teaching us


233
0:16:15,903 --> 0:16:19,508
about arousal addiction by escaping it.


234
0:16:19,508 --> 0:16:20,917
Thanks for listening.


235
0:16:20,917 --> 0:18:20,917
(Applause)
