###2 SAM SMYTH: How about this one?
###4 What you know about an age 14 Antwuan Dixon?
###9 No tattoos.
###10 Who else we got?
###12 How about an age 12 David Gonzalez?
###17 Tony Tave.
###18 More Antwuan.
###20 So this is it.
###21 This is the television where Sean and Mo were discovered.
###25 This is their stuff.
###26 This is the early VHS tapes.
###29 See, this is Malto's.
###31 13 years old when filmed, 14 now.
###42 I don't know why I wasn't thrown off right off the bat.
###44 That white hat looked insane.
###46 SEAN MALTO: I wasn't really filming for a "sponsor me"
###48 video at all.
###48 I just was skating.
###50 I just love skating.
###51 I was a 13-year-old kid, and skating was still new to me,
###56 and we were just having fun.
###58 I didn't even send it in actually.
###60 The guys at Escapist sent it in.
###61 I was on flow for a good two and a half years.
###64 That was a long time I was tripping on it.
###67 SAM SMYTH: I think he went to a Tampa Am when I was still
###70 flowing him.
###71 And I think Toy Machine hit him up and maybe Flip, too.
###77 And he shut them down, so I was like OK, he's solid.
###84 SEAN MALTO: I sent in eight sponsor tapes, thinking is
###87 this going to happen?
###88 And then you have Mike Mo, who was on flow for six months,
###93 was on probably his second sponsor tape, and we go on the
###95 first trip together, and I was like, damn, is it that easy
###99 for other people?
###101 SAM SMYTH: So, look we got two tapes, three DVDs.
###105 This is over a year and a half flow period.
###110 I mean, that's how you get on the team.
###112 
###116 The kid had motivation.
###118 He had drive.
###118 He really wanted on.
###120 So we made his dream a reality.
###123 This is Mike Mo's.
###124 Mike Mo only did two tapes.
###126 
###134 SEAN MALTO: Yeah, Sam called me.
###135 He was like, hey, we want to start giving you boards.
###138 I had Eric Koston posters hanging up on my wall, so I
###141 was like, no way.
###142 I was super psyched.
###144 And then I remember telling my mom about it and my aunt, she
###147 was in town at the time.
###149 And they went, and they looked on the site.
###151 And it was right when Yeah Right! was going on.
###153 And I think one of the trailers was Koston yelling in
###156 that homeless dude's face after everybody came in the
###159 car, and they were like, these are the guys
###161 are giving you boards?
###162 And I was like, yeah.
###164 SAM SMYTH: After we had just known each other through
###167 video, there was this opportunity to actually get
###171 Sean and Mo on a trip with some of the other team, and
###175 that was to Toronto, Canada.
###177 SEAN MALTO: They're going on a trip to Canada, and they were
###179 like hey, do you want to go?
###182 [BLEEP]
###182 of course I want to go.
###184 Yeah, go hang out the Girl team in Canada.
###186 I was psyched on that.
###188 So that was the first trip that me and
###190 Mike Mo went on together.
###192 SAM SMYTH: Mo and Sean were in the same boat, being that they
###195 didn't really know any of the guys too much.
###198 I was pretty much the only one they really knew.
###200 They told me later that they really tripped out when they
###203 saw, at baggage claim, Koston grabbing golf clubs.
###209 
###212 There was probably l a period when I was telling him, look
###216 dude, you're 100%.
###218 We were just waiting for the opportunity to get him on the
###222 road with the boys.
###223 I don't think he was totally wondering where he was going
###227 until that Canada trip, but that was what for sure
###230 solidified it.
###232 SEAN MALTO: After the Yes We Canada trip, that free DVD
###235 came out, and then they had a little part of me and Mike Mo.
###241 And that was our introduction to the team.
###245 When that came out that was like, you're
###247 on, and I was psyched.
###252 I get to hang out with these guys for a long time.
###255 I get to travel with them every year.
###257 It was a dream come true.
###259 SAM SMYTH: I'm super proud of these guys.
###262 I can take all the credit.
###265 Those are the dudes that are doing it themselves, and
###268 they've come a super, super long way.
###271 And I didn't have to much to do it that,
###277 besides noticing them.
###280 But the fact that it was me that noticed them makes me
###283 super proud.
###284 SEAN MALTO: Filming for Pretty Sweet now, it's just a
###288 different caliber, I guess.
###290 When you're in a video with Guy Mariano and Mike Johnson
###293 and Cory Kennedy and stuff.
###296 Yeah, it's crazy.
###297 You have a lot of pressure to come through and have a good
###300 video part, which it's still fun.
###303 You go out.
###304 You can mess around and stuff, but there's a time where you
###307 got to get serious.
###307 And all right, I have to sit here and try this trick for
###311 three hours and hopefully land it.
###315 
###321 SAM SMYTH: What was your question?
###321 Sorry.
###322 I had zoned out.
###323
