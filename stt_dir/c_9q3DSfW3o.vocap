###19 Life is just unreal, just the way it works.
###21 That's exactly what I'm thinking about every time I
###24 cut something open.
###25 
###30 When I start taking stuff out, I look at the inner workings.
###36 And I'm just amazed by it.
###39 I think it's so beautiful.
###40 
###44 A carrot!
###46 A carrot?
###47 Ugh.

###68 Fashion and taxidermy were two very separate things that I
###71 was really interested in.
###72 
###75 The love of anatomy got me into fashion, because I saw
###78 clothes as wearable sculptures that people could wear to
###83 either express themselves or turn into a different person.
###86 
###92 This to me is what fashion is.
###94 It's not really trends.
###95 It's just more about crazy self-expression and becoming
###98 who you want to be.
###99 
###104 I think the first mouse that I did that came out well, I was
###108 so excited.
###109 I was just, like, shit.
###111 I'm going to do this so much more now.
###113 I'm going to fucking do it.
###115 I'm going to do it.
###116 
###119 Whenever I go hiking, I've always got a little cooler and
###122 Tupperware and Ziploc bags and gloves.
###126 And more often than not I'll find something on a hike.
###130 And then when it's the season to trap, I'll go trapping.
###133 
###137 So a friend called me, and told me about a lot of pests
###141 that were on his property, and just gave me the invitation to
###146 come up there and trap.
###149 We set the traps really early in the morning, before all the
###153 animals wake up.
###154 
###157 I always had this connection to the outdoors and science,
###159 and always seen the two as one and the same.
###164 We got something.
###166 I think it's actually even better for women to hunt.
###169 Because I think--
###170 not to be stereotypical or sexist--
###172 but I think women are more intuitive.
###174 They're just a little quieter.
###176 So this guy is small, so he'll fall right out.
###179 We have stuff to prove, but there's kind
###181 of nothing to prove.
###182 Chippy.
###182 With guys it's like, I got to prove that I can
###184 shoot this big gun.
###186 And I got to prove I can catch, like, 45,000 minks this
###189 season, and all this stuff.
###190 Whereas a women would just be like, I caught a chipmunk and
###194 I'm going to put a cherry in its hands and make taxidermy
###197 out of it and just be happy.
###198 
###206 I grew up in Miami, Florida.
###208 My parents were pretty conservative.
###211 My mom was a biology teacher, which had a huge influence on
###214 my love of nature, my love of anatomy.
###218 My dad was an accountant.
###219 And I think he always wanted me to be a doctor, or a
###222 lawyer, or something.
###223 And when he found out I wanted to be artist, he was like,
###225 well you better be really fucking good.
###227 Or else I'll have said I told you so.
###230 
###234 My family is pretty traditional Hindu in that
###236 they're nonviolent.
###238 They don't hunt.
###239 They don't kill animals.
###240 And they're vegetarian.
###241 
###246 Whoo!
###249 Fuck.
###250 
###257 Oh, so we caught a woodchuck.
###260 He's dead.
###260 And he's going to turn into a piece of art.
###262 
###264 So pumped.
###265 Such an adrenaline rush.
###267 We have to go to the general store and get a bigger cooler.
###272 Yeah, I'm OK with killing something and eating it.
###274 And I'm actually feeling better about killing something
###276 and making art out of it and eating it.
###278 Because it seems so much more natural.
###281 It seems so much more real.
###282 And it's super satisfying when you finally do get to get your
###286 hands on something and take it down.
###289 It's a huge accomplishment.
###291 So end of the trapping day, and I got one big one, which
###295 is the biggest thing I'll have mounted, ever.
###298 And one little one, which is still pretty awesome,
###300 because he's cute.
###302 
###311 What I'm going to do right now is skin him, take his guts
###314 out, and all that.
###316 So what I'm going to do is just make a cut right down the
###318 back, all the way down here, and just take it apart.
###322 
###332 I did a lot of dissection in high school.
###334 And I was always the kid who was so ready to dissect
###338 whatever it was.
###339 And this time was dissecting a mouse.
###343 I had never dissected a mouse before.
###345 I was always really curious about their anatomy and stuff.
###349 Because you hear that thing about, their
###351 bones are like rubber.
###352 They just squeeze into whatever.
###353 And I read a bit about taxidermy.
###355 I got some books.
###356 And then got an X-acto knife and some Borax, and
###359 just went at it.
###361 I cut this open and was so amazed by its tiny bones, the
###366 little world inside its body.
###368 It's just fucking fantastic.
###371 He's heavy, oh my god.
###373 Putting him down.
###374 There's that tension and excitement there.
###377 But then there's also the thing, the feeling of, I've
###380 got to keep my hands steady so I don't fuck this up.
###382 
###391 It's deeply reflective when you cut something open.
###393 You see all of its inner workings.
###395 And every time I'm just amazed by this anatomy, and seeing
###400 the structure of an animal.
###402 You're dealing with death.
###403 And death is not pretty.
###404 It's not fun.
###406 There's nothing really light-hearted about it.
###408 
###414 What it does is take something that's ended, for whatever
###417 reason, and give it a second life, give it a new
###422 way to enjoy it.
###423 I think it's a lot more healthy if we remember it.
###425 Not to dwell on it, but to remember and to memorialize,
###428 and to face the reality that is that things and people and
###434 stuff dies.
