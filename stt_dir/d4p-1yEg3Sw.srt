1
0:0:0,17 --> 0:0:3,85
you know i see job listing iran yes
mitch mcconnell for that senate seat in


2
0:0:3,85 --> 0:0:6,549
kentucky vote she decided not to


3
0:0:6,549 --> 0:0:10,9
i'd understand why after listening to
some of the tapes


4
0:0:10,9 --> 0:0:13,2
there were recorded mcconnell's office
so caroline insider


5
0:0:13,2 --> 0:0:16,55
in the mcconnell campaign record of this
strategy sessions


6
0:0:16,55 --> 0:0:20,14
where they're talking about how they
would destroy any political opponent


7
0:0:20,14 --> 0:0:35,79
including actually job first we'll hear
from uh... mitch mcconnell himself


8
0:0:35,79 --> 0:0:37,12
do them out


9
0:0:37,12 --> 0:0:39,85
must be contributing and all of them


10
0:0:39,85 --> 0:0:43,74
bob what about that means hit 'em hit
'em hard that applies ashley judd in


11
0:0:43,74 --> 0:0:44,98
anyone else


12
0:0:44,98 --> 0:0:47,76
so they're being proactive about this
and we have this


13
0:0:47,76 --> 0:0:50,64
his mother chalmers a report on david
corn


14
0:0:50,64 --> 0:0:52,64
several suburban forty seven percent


15
0:0:52,64 --> 0:0:56,7
story during campaign has the tapes from
inside source was which mitch


16
0:0:56,7 --> 0:0:59,4
mcconnell's campaign is very upset about


17
0:0:59,4 --> 0:1:2,19
uh... partly because of what it reveals
about what they were saying about


18
0:1:2,19 --> 0:1:7,39
actually job so uh... on issue or
whether they would use


19
0:1:7,39 --> 0:1:8,939
hard oppression


20
0:1:8,939 --> 0:1:10,78
that she talked about in our book


21
0:1:10,78 --> 0:1:11,89
again sir


22
0:1:11,89 --> 0:1:13,84
so there's an interesting words


23
0:1:13,84 --> 0:1:19,4
accused


24
0:1:19,4 --> 0:1:26,19
joint terrorism or are file


25
0:1:26,19 --> 0:1:28,3
printout nine


26
0:1:28,3 --> 0:1:32,19
so is eco sure to use their depression i
guess ornamental breakdown well


27
0:1:32,19 --> 0:1:36,37
later in the tapes they wind up joking
about different episodes that she had


28
0:1:36,37 --> 0:1:37,4
and a lot


29
0:1:37,4 --> 0:1:38,75
affan laugh and laugh


30
0:1:38,75 --> 0:1:43,63
so i think that was of course quite mad
about this you put out a statement


31
0:1:43,63 --> 0:1:46,95
the decaying depression is a laughing
matter and you know it's a


32
0:1:46,95 --> 0:1:49,939
participants all the structure
specializing in the ritz


33
0:1:49,939 --> 0:1:53,2
uh... my new force these tapes were made
a time when they thought they were


34
0:1:53,2 --> 0:1:55,57
probably gonna run against him


35
0:1:55,57 --> 0:1:59,6
so it now that's not the only thing they
had again so there were used


36
0:1:59,6 --> 0:2:2,289
what they interpreted as her
interpretation


37
0:2:2,289 --> 0:2:8,529
of christianity as


38
0:2:8,529 --> 0:2:23,919
uh... from


39
0:2:23,919 --> 0:2:27,819
so now in reality in our book she talks
record how she's a christian often and


40
0:2:27,819 --> 0:2:32,499
prays often et cetera so that one's very
sketchy and then they were thing you


41
0:2:32,499 --> 0:2:35,45
using things the answer such as her
saying


42
0:2:35,45 --> 0:2:39,85
this you know i have kids and grandkids
of this world and except now is all this


43
0:2:39,85 --> 0:2:41,19
fair game


44
0:2:41,19 --> 0:2:45,9
i say the asme yes politics is


45
0:2:45,9 --> 0:2:49,439
oftentimes dirty advising him running
yes a republican who had mental health


46
0:2:49,439 --> 0:2:51,109
issues


47
0:2:51,109 --> 0:2:53,609
using i would bring it up


48
0:2:53,609 --> 0:2:54,669
tear it up


49
0:2:54,669 --> 0:2:56,859
approve probably bring two-by-four


50
0:2:56,859 --> 0:2:57,839
mckay


51
0:2:57,839 --> 0:3:0,609
so am i surprised that mitch mcconnell


52
0:3:0,609 --> 0:3:3,65
who you-know-what here's a guy who sings
in italy's charismatic person in the


53
0:3:3,65 --> 0:3:5,609
entire world


54
0:3:5,609 --> 0:3:8,279
traumatic isn't always a gobbled right


55
0:3:8,279 --> 0:3:12,389
but he is a legal are among the senate
behavior he got there by accident now we


56
0:3:12,389 --> 0:3:14,939
got there through two things


57
0:3:14,939 --> 0:3:18,189
being really good politics and being in
the wheeling and dealing behind the


58
0:3:18,189 --> 0:3:18,8
scenes


59
0:3:18,8 --> 0:3:21,469
and by being able to have to jobs like
this


60
0:3:21,469 --> 0:3:24,819
and number two by selling out to the
corporations amino you know the largest


61
0:3:24,819 --> 0:3:25,51
cell


62
0:3:25,51 --> 0:3:29,219
a save the leader of the republicans
well those days work for right


63
0:3:29,219 --> 0:3:30,879
and so


64
0:3:30,879 --> 0:3:32,829
he was going to try to bury


65
0:3:32,829 --> 0:3:35,829
accidentally guess what worked actually
jordan said monday


66
0:3:35,829 --> 0:3:37,589
even enter the race


67
0:3:37,589 --> 0:3:41,159
and partly based on some as if they had
already running against our even when


68
0:3:41,159 --> 0:3:44,699
she didn't know about these tapes over
meat being made behind ur back that


69
0:3:44,699 --> 0:3:47,84
they're gonna ask mitch mcconnell about
that the press is


70
0:3:47,84 --> 0:3:50,579
it is a is a spare to use them and the
whole thing though


71
0:3:50,579 --> 0:3:53,91
i remember chair that was recalled to be
fair then use it


72
0:3:53,91 --> 0:3:57,649
they consider using it enemy that they
had internally


73
0:3:57,649 --> 0:3:59,519
that's also different part of the
equation


74
0:3:59,519 --> 0:4:2,89
should you have at least consider that
internally


75
0:4:2,89 --> 0:4:5,509
definitely to be honest with you but a
validation couple doesn't want to answer


76
0:4:5,509 --> 0:4:9,899
that question that's what i hear this
virus back and forth where if you notice


77
0:4:9,899 --> 0:4:12,849
he steadfastly refuses the answer


78
0:4:12,849 --> 0:4:14,349
the question asked


79
0:4:14,349 --> 0:4:17,749
and what is it appropriate for members
of your staff to talk about actually


80
0:4:17,749 --> 0:4:19,239
cares


81
0:4:19,239 --> 0:4:23,149
depression as a


82
0:4:23,149 --> 0:4:27,829
well as you know last month my wife's
ethnicity was attacked by a a left-wing


83
0:4:27,829 --> 0:4:29,9
group in kentucky


84
0:4:29,9 --> 0:4:32,18
and then apparently they also


85
0:4:32,18 --> 0:4:34,99
bug my headquarters


86
0:4:34,99 --> 0:4:36,159
so i think that pretty well


87
0:4:36,159 --> 0:4:45,74
sums up the way the political left is
operating in kentucky


88
0:4:45,74 --> 0:4:49,27
in this transmission yet as i indicated
ob


89
0:4:49,27 --> 0:4:52,81
last month they were attacking my wife
ethnicity


90
0:4:52,81 --> 0:4:55,93
and apparently also unbeknownst to us at
the time they were bugging our


91
0:4:55,93 --> 0:4:57,459
headquarters quite


92
0:4:57,459 --> 0:5:0,159
anek sony and uh...


93
0:5:0,159 --> 0:5:1,529
this is what you get


94
0:5:1,529 --> 0:5:5,309
from the political left in america these
days patch


95
0:5:5,309 --> 0:5:10,529
that finally did it last week they were
attacking my wife ethnicity


96
0:5:10,529 --> 0:5:14,49
and apparently also bugging my
headquarters much like nixon and


97
0:5:14,49 --> 0:5:20,49
watergate that's what the political left
dozens does ride


98
0:5:20,49 --> 0:5:22,779
here's what you're prolly not gonna do


99
0:5:22,779 --> 0:5:25,46
mister kyle office talking std


100
0:5:25,46 --> 0:5:27,969
groups that


101
0:5:27,969 --> 0:5:29,71
however you are determined


102
0:5:29,71 --> 0:5:31,93
now did they actually by this
headquarters no


103
0:5:31,93 --> 0:5:34,739
in fact his own staff look for a bug
going fine


104
0:5:34,739 --> 0:5:38,549
but it's a really clever political
strategies say they bug why cousin


105
0:5:38,549 --> 0:5:42,489
f_b_i_ gets involved and they'll figure
out if it was a


106
0:5:42,489 --> 0:5:46,32
an actual staffer that works for
mcconnell or someone planted a bike


107
0:5:46,32 --> 0:5:47,939
in the middle of that investigation


108
0:5:47,939 --> 0:5:51,89
there are a lot of other josie is a
who's your source now you tell us who


109
0:5:51,89 --> 0:5:54,12
your sources because it was a bug it's
illegal


110
0:5:54,12 --> 0:5:55,879
and hence we got investigated


111
0:5:55,879 --> 0:5:57,18
all that smart


112
0:5:57,18 --> 0:5:59,3
has what it does those two things one


113
0:5:59,3 --> 0:6:1,81
itgroup it tries to find out who


114
0:6:1,81 --> 0:6:2,55
the guy


115
0:6:2,55 --> 0:6:5,21
who's leaking this stuff in the
democrats and liberals as


116
0:6:5,21 --> 0:6:6,959
inside your organization


117
0:6:6,959 --> 0:6:11,599
they're very clever way and number two
ish if the conversation away from


118
0:6:11,599 --> 0:6:15,129
what you're talking about a recession is
that appropriate


119
0:6:15,129 --> 0:6:17,749
when it was an appropriate to possibly


120
0:6:17,749 --> 0:6:19,319
bugger headquarters


121
0:6:19,319 --> 0:6:21,879
now mother jones as we didn't put
bargain headquarters we don't know


122
0:6:21,879 --> 0:6:23,3
anything about bugging


123
0:6:23,3 --> 0:6:24,16
we have a source


124
0:6:24,16 --> 0:6:26,3
or not to reveal that source


125
0:6:26,3 --> 0:6:30,29
turns up in transform pretty clever men


126
0:6:30,29 --> 0:6:32,43
and right now has to do it is gone


127
0:6:32,43 --> 0:6:36,72
and he doesn't have those problems he's
casting himself as the victim here and


128
0:6:36,72 --> 0:6:38,819
he's basically saying batter out


129
0:6:38,819 --> 0:6:39,99
who's next


130
0:6:39,99 --> 0:6:41,65
where i come at me


131
0:6:41,65 --> 0:8:41,65
micah molter
