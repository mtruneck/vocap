###1 CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: You might get in trouble for having a messy room, but some students
###5 are helping clean up their country by trashing their school. That`s coming up. I`m Carl Azuz,
###10 this is CNN STUDENT NEWS.
###16 We are going to start things off today in Egypt. The country is going through some problems,
###29 some political unrest right now. People are angry with Egypt`s president and their protesting
###34 against him. If that sounds familiar, it should: nearly two years ago, Egypt was part of what
###40 some called the Arab Spring: the series of uprisings across the Middle East and Northern
###45 Africa. That led to Egypt`s long time leader being forced out of power. Egypt held its
###50 first free elections after that, and Mohamed Morsi was elected president. We reported on
###55 Monday that Morsi announced that any decisions he makes can`t be reviewed or overturned.
###61 He says he is trying to protect Egypt as it build its new government. The protesters say,
###67 President Morsi is grabbing up power, kind of like a dictator. Some of those protests
###71 have turned violent. Hundreds of people have been injured, at least one person was killed.
###76 We are going to hop across the Atlantic and head to Washington, D.C, specifically to the
###80 White House for a meeting between a president and a president-elect. Enrique Pena Nieto
###86 was elected Mexico`s president back in July. Now, he`s officially going to become president,
###91 to take office on Saturday. Yesterday, he was in Washington, D.C. for a meeting with
###95 U.S. President Obama.
###97 Immigration, security and the drug war in Mexico have been some of the biggest issues
###101 for these two countries recently. They were expected to come up in yesterday`s meeting,
###105 too, but President Elect P said he wants the relationship between the U.S. and Mexico to
###110 go beyond that. He said one of his biggest goals is to strengthen the economic ties between
###115 the neighboring nations. The U.S. is Mexico`s biggest trading partner, sharing billions
###120 of dollars in imports and exports.
###122 A lot of the action in our next story is happening at the U.S. Capitol. That`s where members
###126 of Congress are considering the fiscal cliff and how to avoid going over it. Now, really,
###132 what this comes down to, is debt. The U.S. government has it: trillions of dollars worth.
###136 It`s got to try to find ways to reduce that debt, and that`s where the fiscal cliff comes
###141 in. Now, it`s not an actual cliff, it`s an economic one. And it involves two main things:
###147 one, how the government takes in money through taxes and two, how it spends money.
###153 If the country goes over this fiscal cliff, taxes will go up for everyone, plus government
###158 spending cuts will automatically go into a fact. That would effect the military, national
###163 parks and other government services. If Congress and the president can agree on ways to cut
###168 government debt, then the country won`t go over the cliff. They`ve been working on that
###172 for a while, both sides have presented ideas, there was even the special super committee
###176 in Congress that tried to come up with ways to reduce the debt. So far, though, no deal.
###182 And the deadline now is January, First. If a deal is not reached by then, that`s when
###187 the U.S. would go over this fiscal cliff.

###191 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Is this legit? Salmonella is a type of virus.
###198 This one is not true. Salmonella are bacteria that can cause food poisoning and other health
###204 problems.
###205 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###208 AZUZ: Back in June, 41 people in 20 U.S. states got sick because of a salmonella outbreak.
###214 Officials with the FDA, the Food and Drug Administration, traced this outbreak to a
###218 peanut butter plant in New Mexico. On Monday, regulators shut it down. Back in 2011, new
###225 food safety laws gave the FDA the power to shut facilities down. This is the first time
###230 it`s done it. And an FDA report found the conditions at the plant might have led to
###234 the products there being contaminated with salmonella. A spokeswoman for the company
###239 that owns this plant says it`s working with officials to get the proper health and safety
###244 procedures in place.

###246 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today`s "Shoutout" goes out to coach Cochran`s, coach Julian`s and
###251 Mrs. McClanahan`s classes at Winfield High School in Winfield, West Virginia.
###257 What Central American country is highlighted on this map?
###261 You know what to do. Is it Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras or Nicaragua? You`ve got three seconds,
###268 go!
###270 That`s Guatemala, a country that`s home to more than 14 million people. That`s your answer
###280 and that`s your "Shoutout."
###282 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###284 AZUZ: A German fashion designer who lives in Guatemala came up with an idea to help
###289 clean up the country: stuff trash inside empty plastic bottles. After a hurricane ripped
###294 through her village, she realized her bottles could be used to rebuild. That`s when the
###299 ecobrick was born.
###301 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###304 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I`m Susanna Heise (ph), I`m the founder of the Pura Vida Movement.
###313 We are here in like Atitlan (ph), and this is in Guatemala in Central America. And this
###324 is called the most beautiful lake on earth.
###327 In the `60s, this new material plastic came. That was totally new for them, plastic is
###335 also -- it`s not a bad material, it helped them a lot. But nobody told them like, look,
###342 this is not a leaf, this is not going to decompose. This is going to stay here for 20, 30, 50,
###349 100, 500 years.
###350 CHRIS BARRY, FMR. PEACE CORP VOLUNTEER: The trash problem is affecting these communities
###355 in several ways. Tourism is a big issue. Cyanobacteria blows up in the lake. Tourists are no longer
###362 allowed to swim, and that region is very much dependent on tourism.
###365 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is the Pura Vida, famous Pura Vida wall, built out of 1,000
###372 ecobricks. And these ecobricks have been (inaudible) by many children, kindergarten children.
###378 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It is trash and it is a container for trash. And when it`s filled
###383 with trash, it has sufficient integrity to be a building block.
###387 BARRY: And you use those as a basic building material, and you are also -- are able to
###391 clean up the community and teach about environment education and importance of maintaining a
###397 clean environment around you, trash management, all that kind of good stuff.
###402 GERSON GUITZ, HUG IT FORWARD: We are building a two-classroom school in a community in Pachai
###408 (ph). This school serves about 200 kids. As you can see, it takes about 6,000 bottles
###415 to finish a whole construction, and this is the last square that we are making right now.
###418 And we are tying all the bottles, all the bottles have to be the same height.
###422 BARRY: People are really catching on to the idea. Projects are growing in El Salvador,
###426 Guyana, I`ve heard of a similar type building in Thailand.
###430 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It makes me so glad that the idea of the (inaudible) is spreading from
###435 like Atitlan towards all Guatemala, towards the whole world. That`ll be a part of the
###441 solution and not a part of the problem anymore.

###447 AZUZ: All around Indianapolis, people are showing their support for Chuck Pagano. He
###452 is the head coach of the NFL`s Indianapolis Colts and he`s fighting cancer. A team cheerleader
###457 offered to shave her head if the team`s mascot could raise $10,000 for cancer research. He
###464 raised $22,000. The cheerleader says she was happy to lose her locks for the cause.
###469 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
###470 MEGAN M., COLTS CHEERLEADER: I wasn`t freaked out. I was just so excited and proud of our
###475 city for pulling together for a great cause. The cheers were deafening, it was just phenomenal,
###480 I was able to have another cheerleader join me at the last minute and be able to hold
###484 her hand while we both went through this process. It was just absolutely phenomenal, and, you
###489 know, everyone hopes to make an impact in their life, and I was just lucky enough that
###492 Blue (ph) came up with this idea and we were able to do something really good.
###495 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###496 AZUZ: Yesterday, we told you about the college basketball record set by Jack Taylor. Most
###501 of you think, he is a basketball star. On our blog, Haylie wrote, "Taylor deserves the
###506 new record because if you have skill, you should be able to shine!"
###510 Brandon says "It`s unusual for anyone to score that many points. Plus, he had the help of
###514 his coach and the team to get him the ball to make those shots."
###518 And Ashley argues, "If Taylor`s team members thought of him as a ball hog, they wouldn`t
###523 have continuously passed the ball to him."
###525 Brennan believes that scoring 138 points would not make him a hero because he basically embarrassed
###531 the other team, and that beat down could turn those other players off to basketball.
###536 Mark says, that while Taylor`s skills are exceptional, "his teammates deserve more credit
###541 for things like playing great defense and hustling down the floor."
###545 And from Olivia, "I do think he was a ball hog, but does that term always have to be
###549 negative? He did his job and what he was told to do. He is a star and the ball hog, and
###554 there is nothing wrong with that.
###556 Remember, when you were a kid, and you would sit in the cart at the grocery store, that
###560 was kind of fun, right? This is the grownup version. It`s 12 feet long, 9 feet tall. That
###566 guy must need a lot of groceries.
###568 This is just a publicity stunt, the super-sized cart draws lots of lookers and shoppers, or
###573 at least that`s the plan. The store`s owner spent two years and tens of thousands of dollars
###578 building it. He admits, he`s better with food than four wheelers. So, it`s possible he had
###584 to work out some buggies, probably needed a detailed map to figure it all out, that`s
###588 when you call on a cartographer.
###588 It`s time for us to hit the road, for CNN STUDENT NEWS, I`m Carl Azuz. See you later.
