the guys can just go out, get
the feel of the bike.

And then we have two qualifying
periods, both half


40
0:2:38,68 --> 0:2:42,16
an hour each, and it's their
best lap time from either of


41
0:2:42,16 --> 0:2:44,405

them their grid position.

difficult things as a

0:3:58,91 --> 0:4:0,5

with yourself.

0:4:0,5 --> 0:4:3,43
You look at your lap time,
you're 2 seconds or 3 seconds

0:4:3,43 --> 0:4:7,3
behind the leaders, that seems
like an eternity as a rider.

You're working with 13-
to 16-year-old kids.

throws a big curve ball into

mentally are really strong,


71
0:4:16,579 --> 0:4:19,96
and some kids, just the
slightest little excuse they


72
0:4:19,96 --> 0:4:22,32
can think of, then their
attitude goes out the window


73
0:4:22,32 --> 0:4:24,91

don't even really want to
