1
0:0:1,3 --> 0:0:3,0
Prof: I do want to talk
about chords.


2
0:0:3,0 --> 0:0:8,675
Last time we worked through
this idea of the scale and how


3
0:0:8,675 --> 0:0:14,55
you can build triads on each of
the members of the scale.


4
0:0:14,55 --> 0:0:17,687
And we talked about a triad
being a configuration of three


5
0:0:17,687 --> 0:0:20,99
pitches where you take the
first, the third and the fifth.


6
0:0:20,99 --> 0:0:25,54
The first of the triad--this is
a term that we'll be going over


7
0:0:25,54 --> 0:0:26,89
today--is called the what?
 


8
0:0:26,89 --> 0:0:30,73
The root of the triad so if we
have >


9
0:0:30,73 --> 0:0:35,8
C, E, G, the C is the root of
the triad.


10
0:0:35,8 --> 0:0:38,707
The lowest note of this
aggregate of three is the root


11
0:0:38,707 --> 0:0:39,53
of the triad.
 


12
0:0:39,53 --> 0:0:43,8
So we can build triads on each
of the members of the scale,


13
0:0:43,8 --> 0:0:45,511
and we said that some of these
chords tend to be used a lot


14
0:0:45,511 --> 0:0:47,916
more than others,
that the tonic (I) is very


15
0:0:47,916 --> 0:0:50,58
important,
the dominant (V) is important,


16
0:0:50,58 --> 0:0:52,658
the sub-dominant right next to
and below the dominant is


17
0:0:52,658 --> 0:0:54,806
important,
and we're going to be talking


18
0:0:54,806 --> 0:0:56,14
about the VI chord today.
 


19
0:0:56,14 --> 0:0:57,47
We could give that a name.
 


20
0:0:57,47 --> 0:0:59,612
We could call it the
sub-mediant but that's probably


21
0:0:59,612 --> 0:1:0,619
getting too technical.
 


22
0:1:0,619 --> 0:1:2,25
We'll just call it the VI chord.
 


23
0:1:2,25 --> 0:1:4,968
So we've got a I chord built on
the first degree of the scale,


24
0:1:4,968 --> 0:1:7,578
a V chord built on the fifth
degree of the scale,


25
0:1:7,578 --> 0:1:10,498
a IV chord built on the--a IV
chord built on the fourth


26
0:1:10,498 --> 0:1:12,87
degree,
and a VI chord built on the


27
0:1:12,87 --> 0:1:13,819
sixth degree.
 


28
0:1:13,819 --> 0:1:17,867
Now I had an interesting
discussion in section this past


29
0:1:17,867 --> 0:1:21,989
week and a couple of really good
questions were asked.


30
0:1:21,989 --> 0:1:23,665
I started by saying,
"Could you come up with


31
0:1:23,665 --> 0:1:26,198
any kind of--
well, you tell me in fifty


32
0:1:26,198 --> 0:1:30,989
words or less what I said in
lecture yesterday about harmony.


33
0:1:30,989 --> 0:1:32,29
How does harmony work?
 


34
0:1:32,29 --> 0:1:35,393
Can you come up with a visual
image of how harmony


35
0:1:35,393 --> 0:1:36,28
works?"
 


36
0:1:36,28 --> 0:1:37,91
So we tried out a couple of
things.


37
0:1:37,91 --> 0:1:41,503
One of the things that we
discussed was this type of


38
0:1:41,503 --> 0:1:45,45
imagery here where you have
vertically these pillars,


39
0:1:45,45 --> 0:1:47,47
if you will,
or we could even call--


40
0:1:47,47 --> 0:1:50,262
the more I sort of looked at
this--sort of call them tree


41
0:1:50,262 --> 0:1:51,6
trunks almost.
 


42
0:1:51,6 --> 0:1:55,275
And these tree trunks were the
chords and at the base of each


43
0:1:55,275 --> 0:1:57,876
of these chords at least
conceptually,


44
0:1:57,876 --> 0:2:1,319
theoretically,
is this thing called the root.


45
0:2:1,319 --> 0:2:4,519
So I like this tree metaphor
here.


46
0:2:4,519 --> 0:2:8,826
So we've got the root here of
the--and then the trunk and then


47
0:2:8,826 --> 0:2:11,933
up above, of course,
this florid canopy would


48
0:2:11,933 --> 0:2:13,77
musically be the what?
 


49
0:2:13,77 --> 0:2:15,84
The melody. Okay.
 


50
0:2:15,84 --> 0:2:17,86
So we might think about that.
 


51
0:2:17,86 --> 0:2:20,306
Now in the course of this,
a student asked a very good


52
0:2:20,306 --> 0:2:23,3
question that I should have
pointed out a long time ago,


53
0:2:23,3 --> 0:2:25,717
and that is:
when an orchestra plays or an


54
0:2:25,717 --> 0:2:29,126
ensemble plays and they're
looking at their music and


55
0:2:29,126 --> 0:2:33,169
they're reading their music,
do they play a chord?


56
0:2:33,169 --> 0:2:37,162
Does the violin play a chord
and are the trumpets--each


57
0:2:37,162 --> 0:2:41,819
trumpet playing a chord and the
viola--is it playing a chord?


58
0:2:41,819 --> 0:2:43,378
What do you think?
 


59
0:2:43,378 --> 0:2:43,772
No.
 


60
0:2:43,772 --> 0:2:50,199
It's just playing one note--one
note of a chord.


61
0:2:50,199 --> 0:2:52,95
And once again we,
our ears, hear this aggregate


62
0:2:52,95 --> 0:2:55,697
of sound and then we say,
"Oh, it's got that,


63
0:2:55,697 --> 0:2:58,144
that, that, that,"
and we extrapolate out of that


64
0:2:58,144 --> 0:3:0,36
information that it is this
particular chord.


65
0:3:0,36 --> 0:3:4,694
But if you were to look at what
the YSO has on its stands


66
0:3:4,694 --> 0:3:6,938
nobody's playing the chord.
 


67
0:3:6,938 --> 0:3:10,758
They're just playing individual
notes that all together form a


68
0:3:10,758 --> 0:3:11,258
chord.
 


69
0:3:11,258 --> 0:3:14,28
And we pointed out,
however, that one individual


70
0:3:14,28 --> 0:3:16,873
has a--
the music that has all of these


71
0:3:16,873 --> 0:3:19,43
parts on it--
and that, of course,


72
0:3:19,43 --> 0:3:22,2
is the conductor who has the
full conducting score--


73
0:3:22,2 --> 0:3:24,59
the full score--in front of him
or her.


74
0:3:24,59 --> 0:3:27,242
So that was one interesting
question that came up,


75
0:3:27,242 --> 0:3:30,383
so keep this in mind if you're
wondering about this idea of


76
0:3:30,383 --> 0:3:30,979
chords.
 


77
0:3:30,979 --> 0:3:32,949
So we could say this is the
root, maybe this is the third


78
0:3:32,949 --> 0:3:33,758
and that's the fifth.
 


79
0:3:33,758 --> 0:3:37,573
These other instruments are
filling in these things at


80
0:3:37,573 --> 0:3:41,53
various spots to produce this
aggregate of the chord.


81
0:3:41,53 --> 0:3:45,39
Supposing this--we mentioned
this also, this idea--supposing


82
0:3:45,39 --> 0:3:48,729
we had other things kind of
running around there.


83
0:3:48,729 --> 0:3:52,514
Without those other things
running around we would have a


84
0:3:52,514 --> 0:3:56,639
good sort of model of homophonic
texture, sort of block chords


85
0:3:56,639 --> 0:3:58,598
changing in that fashion.
 


86
0:3:58,598 --> 0:4:1,151
If you put in other little
strands of melody,


87
0:4:1,151 --> 0:4:3,878
it changes it more toward
polyphonic texture.


88
0:4:3,878 --> 0:4:7,419
Let's review another point and
I'll get to a second question


89
0:4:7,419 --> 0:4:8,439
that was asked.
 


90
0:4:8,439 --> 0:4:10,938
Why do we have to change chords?
 


91
0:4:10,938 --> 0:4:14,598
We talked about this last time.
 


92
0:4:14,598 --> 0:4:17,55
Why do we change chords?
 


93
0:4:17,55 --> 0:4:18,41
Yeah.
 


94
0:4:18,41 --> 0:4:19,56
Student:
>


95
0:4:19,56 --> 0:4:19,819
Melody?
 


96
0:4:19,819 --> 0:4:23,807
Prof: Because the melody
changes and not all harmonies


97
0:4:23,807 --> 0:4:26,0
are concordant with every note.
 


98
0:4:26,0 --> 0:4:30,519
Someone asked me,
"Well, why are some notes


99
0:4:30,519 --> 0:4:35,519
consonant and why are other
notes dissonant?"


100
0:4:35,519 --> 0:4:38,774
And the answer has to do with
ratios and string sizes and


101
0:4:38,774 --> 0:4:41,1
lengths of pipe and things like
that,


102
0:4:41,1 --> 0:4:44,603
but generally speaking,
pitches that are right next to


103
0:4:44,603 --> 0:4:47,132
each other--
very close to each other--are


104
0:4:47,132 --> 0:4:47,74
dissonant.
 


105
0:4:47,74 --> 0:4:51,43
If you get a highly irrational
ratio like nine to eight,


106
0:4:51,43 --> 0:4:54,43
which is the whole tone,
or seventeen or eighteen to


107
0:4:54,43 --> 0:4:56,391
seventeen--
which, just depending upon your


108
0:4:56,391 --> 0:4:59,442
internal tuning,
is the half step--those


109
0:4:59,442 --> 0:5:2,959
irrational ratios are very
dissonant,


110
0:5:2,959 --> 0:5:4,221
>
 


111
0:5:4,221 --> 0:5:5,67
or >
 


112
0:5:5,67 --> 0:5:8,177
that kind of sound,
but if you allow a little space


113
0:5:8,177 --> 0:5:10,805
in there--
Let's say you go to a


114
0:5:10,805 --> 0:5:14,47
three-to-two ratio or a
six-to-five--


115
0:5:14,47 --> 0:5:17,709
even a six-to-five ratio,
it gets more consonant.


116
0:5:17,709 --> 0:5:19,23
Let's see how this would play
out.


117
0:5:19,23 --> 0:5:24,786
Here for example we have the
pitch C and either note above or


118
0:5:24,786 --> 0:5:27,9
below it is dissonant.
 


119
0:5:27,9 --> 0:5:28,199
These are very close together.
 


120
0:5:28,199 --> 0:5:29,889
Now let's play this on the
piano.


121
0:5:29,889 --> 0:5:30,48
So here is a C.
 


122
0:5:30,48 --> 0:5:31,541
>
 


123
0:5:31,541 --> 0:5:33,586
If I play the D above it,
>


124
0:5:33,586 --> 0:5:35,238
it's dissonant,
>


125
0:5:35,238 --> 0:5:36,42
the D below it,
it's dissonant,


126
0:5:36,42 --> 0:5:38,583
but let's say I go down to the
A below it, <<plays


127
0:5:38,583 --> 0:5:39,95
piano>>
 


128
0:5:39,95 --> 0:5:41,769
allowing a little separation
between the two pitches now.


129
0:5:41,769 --> 0:5:42,916
>
 


130
0:5:42,916 --> 0:5:43,596
What about that?
 


131
0:5:43,596 --> 0:5:44,66
Consonant or dissonant?
 


132
0:5:44,66 --> 0:5:45,738
Sounds a lot better.
 


133
0:5:45,738 --> 0:5:48,274
What about this,
now going down to the G against


134
0:5:48,274 --> 0:5:48,759
the C?
 


135
0:5:48,759 --> 0:5:50,89
>
 


136
0:5:50,89 --> 0:5:52,44
Yeah, it sounds fine,
>


137
0:5:52,44 --> 0:5:55,228
sounds well,
kind of bland or revving in


138
0:5:55,228 --> 0:5:56,23
neutral there.
 


139
0:5:56,23 --> 0:5:57,589
What about this?
 


140
0:5:57,589 --> 0:5:58,87
>
 


141
0:5:58,87 --> 0:6:0,206
Yeah, it sounds sort of nice.
 


142
0:6:0,206 --> 0:6:0,99
What about this?
 


143
0:6:0,99 --> 0:6:2,69
>
 


144
0:6:2,69 --> 0:6:4,947
Yeah, not so much,
but if you think about it--so


145
0:6:4,947 --> 0:6:8,62
it's not that--if you--it's not
that we're allowing even more


146
0:6:8,62 --> 0:6:9,54
space here.
 


147
0:6:9,54 --> 0:6:12,831
What we've done is taken this
pitch and played it all the way


148
0:6:12,831 --> 0:6:16,18
down an octave below it so we're
actually getting back to this


149
0:6:16,18 --> 0:6:18,87
configuration of the pitch right
next to it,


150
0:6:18,87 --> 0:6:21,675
and we could--then of course we
could go down one more step


151
0:6:21,675 --> 0:6:23,79
>
 


152
0:6:23,79 --> 0:6:26,644
and we would get the octave,
which is a duplication of


153
0:6:26,644 --> 0:6:27,519
two-to-one.
 


154
0:6:27,519 --> 0:6:31,889
So that's a very wide sort of
ratio there.


155
0:6:31,889 --> 0:6:33,89
So that's something to think
about.


156
0:6:33,89 --> 0:6:37,108
The closer these pitches are
together, the more likely they


157
0:6:37,108 --> 0:6:41,197
are to be dissonant--and the
desire to have some space added


158
0:6:41,197 --> 0:6:41,889
there.
 


159
0:6:41,889 --> 0:6:43,6
Questions about that?
 


160
0:6:43,6 --> 0:6:45,79
Okay.
 


161
0:6:45,79 --> 0:6:49,139
Let's go on now to talk about
chord progression.


162
0:6:49,139 --> 0:6:51,516
Anybody want to do--what's your
understanding of what a chord


163
0:6:51,516 --> 0:6:52,19
progression is?
 


164
0:6:52,19 --> 0:6:54,206
If I said "chord
progression"--I think we


165
0:6:54,206 --> 0:6:55,779
have that term up on the board
today.


166
0:6:55,779 --> 0:6:59,279
What is a chord progression?
 


167
0:6:59,279 --> 0:7:1,819
I--let's see.
 


168
0:7:1,819 --> 0:7:2,944
Are you going to?
 


169
0:7:2,944 --> 0:7:3,274
Yeah.
 


170
0:7:3,274 --> 0:7:4,69
Fire away.
 


171
0:7:4,69 --> 0:7:6,62
Student:
>


172
0:7:6,62 --> 0:7:7,826
Prof: Nice and loud,
a little bit louder.


173
0:7:7,826 --> 0:7:8,29
I couldn't hear.
 


174
0:7:8,29 --> 0:7:9,838
Student: A sequence of
chords that sound good together?


175
0:7:9,838 --> 0:7:10,476
Prof: Okay.
 


176
0:7:10,476 --> 0:7:10,653
Good.
 


177
0:7:10,653 --> 0:7:11,79
Excellent.
 


178
0:7:11,79 --> 0:7:13,264
A sequence of chords that sound
good together,


179
0:7:13,264 --> 0:7:16,49
kind of make sense together;
we could say that sort of march


180
0:7:16,49 --> 0:7:18,259
along in a purposeful fashion.
 


181
0:7:18,259 --> 0:7:24,0
>
 


182
0:7:24,0 --> 0:7:26,232
--that kind of make sense
together.


183
0:7:26,232 --> 0:7:27,19
All right?
 


184
0:7:27,19 --> 0:7:30,266
They seem to be going somewhere
and there's this sort of force


185
0:7:30,266 --> 0:7:33,249
of pull or gravity in music
having to do with some chords


186
0:7:33,249 --> 0:7:35,6
wanting to go to other chords.
 


187
0:7:35,6 --> 0:7:37,55
So we've got a chord
progression.


188
0:7:37,55 --> 0:7:39,3
We've talked about the root of
the triad.


189
0:7:39,3 --> 0:7:40,339
>
 


190
0:7:40,339 --> 0:7:45,5
The root of the triad is the
bottom-most pitch of that triad.


191
0:7:45,5 --> 0:7:46,817

192

193
0:7:48,918 --> 0:7:50,87
C, E, G, but we decided to
start with the


194
0:7:50,87 --> 0:7:51,896

195
0:7:51,896 --> 0:7:54,581
E, G and then put the C up on

0:7:54,581 --> 0:7:55,509
C, E, G, C.
 


197
0:7:55,509 --> 0:7:57,73
Well, that'd be what's called a
chord inversion.


198
0:7:57,73 --> 0:8:0,281
We're not going to get into
that 'cause that takes us into


199
0:8:0,281 --> 0:8:3,182
heavy-duty music theory,
but it's--if we don't have root


200
0:8:3,182 --> 0:8:6,348
position then we've got some
other note of the triad in the


201
0:8:6,348 --> 0:8:8,624
bass,
and we've got some kind of


202
0:8:8,624 --> 0:8:12,312
chord inversion,
so that's what that particular


203
0:8:12,312 --> 0:8:14,28
term means up there.
 


204
0:8:14,28 --> 0:8:17,92
What are we going to do to hear
these chords?


205
0:8:17,92 --> 0:8:20,24
How do we hear chord
progressions?


206
0:8:20,24 --> 0:8:21,0
How do we hear harmony?
 


207
0:8:21,0 --> 0:8:22,509
What are we listening for again?
 


208
0:8:22,509 --> 0:8:26,709
Obviously, we've talked about
it again and again and again.


209
0:8:26,709 --> 0:8:29,406
We're going to be listening for
the bass.


210
0:8:29,406 --> 0:8:29,879
Okay?
 


211
0:8:29,879 --> 0:8:32,424
And all of our musical
experience tells us to listen to


212
0:8:32,424 --> 0:8:34,37
melody;
melody's beautiful--that's what


213
0:8:34,37 --> 0:8:35,605
we want to hear,
but now to get a sense of


214
0:8:35,605 --> 0:8:37,33
harmony we're going to listen to
the bass.


215
0:8:37,33 --> 0:8:39,62
And we said last time we want
to do two things.


216
0:8:39,62 --> 0:8:42,672
We want to figure out if the
harmony is changing,


217
0:8:42,672 --> 0:8:46,36
and if it is changing whether
it's changing at a regular or


218
0:8:46,36 --> 0:8:47,57
irregular rate.
 


219
0:8:47,57 --> 0:8:52,48
By regular rate we mean that
the amount of time that each


220
0:8:52,48 --> 0:8:57,97
chord holds is exactly the same;
every chord holds for the same


221
0:8:57,97 --> 0:8:58,34
length of time.
 


222
0:8:58,34 --> 0:9:2,51
If one chord holds twice as
long or only half as long,


223
0:9:2,51 --> 0:9:6,918
then we have an irregular
harmonic change--irregular rate


224
0:9:6,918 --> 0:9:8,73
of harmonic change.
 


225
0:9:8,73 --> 0:9:11,539
So let's begin with our first
example here this morning.


226
0:9:11,539 --> 0:9:13,58
It's from Richard Wagner.
 


227
0:9:13,58 --> 0:9:16,466
It's the beginning of his
Ring cycle and we're


228
0:9:16,466 --> 0:9:18,169
going to listen to this.
 


229
0:9:18,169 --> 0:9:19,149
Well, how do we hear the bass?
 


230
0:9:19,149 --> 0:9:22,178
How do we tell if the harmony
is changing?


231
0:9:22,178 --> 0:9:25,288
What I do is try to sing the
bass.


232
0:9:25,288 --> 0:9:27,72
I don't know whether it's
easier for gentlemen or not


233
0:9:27,72 --> 0:9:29,87
because our voices are sort of
in the bass,


234
0:9:29,87 --> 0:9:32,936
but maybe this is payback time
since ladies are always singing


235
0:9:32,936 --> 0:9:33,59
the melody.
 


236
0:9:33,59 --> 0:9:37,629
So we'll focus on the bass and
we'll try to sing the bass,


237
0:9:37,629 --> 0:9:41,841
and if we find that in singing
the bass our voice is not


238
0:9:41,841 --> 0:9:44,657
changing,
probably the harmony hasn't


239
0:9:44,657 --> 0:9:45,288
changed.
 


240
0:9:45,288 --> 0:9:49,106
If we have to sing a different
pitch, then probably the harmony


241
0:9:49,106 --> 0:9:49,97
has changed.
 


242
0:9:49,97 --> 0:9:53,29
So let's try that as an initial
modus operandi here and we'll


243
0:9:53,29 --> 0:9:54,0
see how it works.
 


244
0:9:54,0 --> 0:9:55,85
So here's an example from
Wagner.


245
0:9:55,85 --> 0:9:58,45
>
 


246
0:9:58,45 --> 0:10:1,298
See if you can find the pitch.
 


247
0:10:1,298 --> 0:10:2,36
Sing it.
 


248
0:10:2,36 --> 0:10:5,809
I want to hear the sound.
 


249
0:10:5,809 --> 0:10:9,9
Louder, please.
 


250
0:10:9,9 --> 0:10:33,96
>
 


251
0:10:33,96 --> 0:10:35,99
Did it change? No.
 


252
0:10:35,99 --> 0:10:39,85
He just keeps that same E-flat
chord for about six minutes at


253
0:10:39,85 --> 0:10:41,82
the beginning of the Overture to
Rheingold,


254
0:10:41,82 --> 0:10:44,395
and on the basis of that you
know there's going to be a very


255
0:10:44,395 --> 0:10:45,269
long opera.
 


256
0:10:45,269 --> 0:10:47,394
If he's going to sit there on
one chord for that amount of


257
0:10:47,394 --> 0:10:49,408
time, it's going to go on for a
long period of time.


258
0:10:49,408 --> 0:10:49,696
Okay.
 


259
0:10:49,696 --> 0:10:53,2
Let's listen to an example from
the realm of pop music this


260
0:10:53,2 --> 0:10:53,48
time.
 


261
0:10:53,48 --> 0:10:54,895
What about this one?
 


262
0:10:54,895 --> 0:10:56,29
Is it changing?
 


263
0:10:56,29 --> 0:10:59,9
I think this is Dave Matthews
Band.


264
0:10:59,9 --> 0:11:0,46
What about this one?
 


265
0:11:0,46 --> 0:11:2,7
See if you can sing the pitch.
 


266
0:11:2,7 --> 0:11:12,95
>
 


267
0:11:12,95 --> 0:11:16,279
Sing it.
 


268
0:11:16,279 --> 0:11:24,778
>
 


269
0:11:24,778 --> 0:11:26,447
What about that one?
 


270
0:11:26,447 --> 0:11:27,7
Did it change?
 


271
0:11:27,7 --> 0:11:28,91
No.
 


272
0:11:28,91 --> 0:11:32,538
So that one didn't change
either.


273
0:11:32,538 --> 0:11:35,528
We're going to have some that
change, and we're going to work


274
0:11:35,528 --> 0:11:37,82
through this progressively in
just a moment.


275
0:11:37,82 --> 0:11:41,279
I want to make one other point
before we launch into that,


276
0:11:41,279 --> 0:11:45,408
and that is the following:
that composers use the rate of


277
0:11:45,408 --> 0:11:48,504
harmonic change--
whether it's changing or not


278
0:11:48,504 --> 0:11:50,44
changing--
to sort of make us feel


279
0:11:50,44 --> 0:11:53,59
different ways about the music
that we are listening to.


280
0:11:53,59 --> 0:11:57,73
It gives a sense of what this
music is all--


281
0:11:57,73 --> 0:12:0,84
really all about and since,
as we were saying,


282
0:12:0,84 --> 0:12:4,192
so much classical music doesn't
have a text with it we've got to


283
0:12:4,192 --> 0:12:7,438
have some markers in there to
know what the composer is trying


284
0:12:7,438 --> 0:12:8,769
to communicate to us.
 


285
0:12:8,769 --> 0:12:13,899
Here's a famous example from
Mozart's G Minor Symphony.


286
0:12:13,899 --> 0:12:26,389
>
 


287
0:12:26,389 --> 0:12:27,58
And so on.
 


288
0:12:27,58 --> 0:12:30,72
So if I separated this noodling
here, <<plays


289
0:12:30,72 --> 0:12:30,82
piano>>
 


290
0:12:30,82 --> 0:12:35,743
which is just a kind of
arpeggio <<plays


291
0:12:35,743 --> 0:12:37,166
music>>
 


292
0:12:37,166 --> 0:12:43,62
patterning of the chord and
just have the chord stay there--


293
0:12:43,62 --> 0:12:46,575
>
 


294
0:12:46,575 --> 0:12:49,529
>
 


295
0:12:49,529 --> 0:12:49,99
All right.
 


296
0:12:49,99 --> 0:12:51,649
So those are the chords
underneath.


297
0:12:51,649 --> 0:12:53,899
You notice at the beginning
>


298
0:12:53,899 --> 0:12:58,676
one-two, two-two,
three-two, four-two,


299
0:12:58,676 --> 0:13:3,84
one-two, two-two,
three-two, four-two.


300
0:13:3,84 --> 0:13:5,519
At the beginning <<plays
piano>>


301
0:13:5,519 --> 0:13:8,596
these chords are holding for
four measures or a total of


302
0:13:8,596 --> 0:13:9,379
eight beats.
 


303
0:13:9,379 --> 0:13:26,9
Then as it goes on,
>


304
0:13:26,9 --> 0:13:28,58
what happens here?
 


305
0:13:28,58 --> 0:13:29,139
>
 


306
0:13:29,139 --> 0:13:30,82
Change, change,
change, change--changing on


307
0:13:30,82 --> 0:13:32,7
every beat--then <<plays
piano>>


308
0:13:32,7 --> 0:13:34,6
change, change,
change, change,


309
0:13:34,6 --> 0:13:35,168
change.
 


310
0:13:35,168 --> 0:13:37,519
Then we're getting two changes
per beat.


311
0:13:37,519 --> 0:13:40,98
So what's happened to the rate
of harmonic change here?


312
0:13:40,98 --> 0:13:42,669
Is it regular or irregular?
 


313
0:13:42,669 --> 0:13:43,38
Students: Irregular.
 


314
0:13:43,38 --> 0:13:46,548
Prof: Highly irregular,
and what is happening to it?


315
0:13:46,548 --> 0:13:48,97
It's getting faster and faster
and faster.


316
0:13:48,97 --> 0:13:52,61
So here in the G Minor Symphony
we feel as--


317
0:13:52,61 --> 0:13:55,779
oh, it's so full of tension,
angst,


318
0:13:55,779 --> 0:14:0,84
anxiety, perhaps passion,
it's driving somewhere,


319
0:14:0,84 --> 0:14:4,636
and one of the things that's
driving it is its accelerating


320
0:14:4,636 --> 0:14:6,34
rate of harmonic change.
 


321
0:14:6,34 --> 0:14:9,255
The amount of time that each
chord is holding is getting


322
0:14:9,255 --> 0:14:12,649
shorter and shorter and shorter
as we drive into that cadence.


323
0:14:12,649 --> 0:14:15,22
Now the cadence is
>


324
0:14:15,22 --> 0:14:18,503
--cadence is simply the end of
a musical phrase,


325
0:14:18,503 --> 0:14:22,414
particularly in this case the
end of a chord progression,


326
0:14:22,414 --> 0:14:25,139
where we are at a point of
arrival;


327
0:14:25,139 --> 0:14:27,87
the cadence brings us to a
point of arrival.


328
0:14:27,87 --> 0:14:29,908
So that's a piece of Mozart.
 


329
0:14:29,908 --> 0:14:32,177
Let's turn to a piece of
Beethoven now,


330
0:14:32,177 --> 0:14:35,519
his Symphony number Six,
the Pastoral Symphony.


331
0:14:35,519 --> 0:14:37,48
Let's listen to just a bit of
it.


332
0:14:37,48 --> 0:14:43,509
>
 


333
0:14:43,509 --> 0:14:48,179
Can you pick out the bass?
 


334
0:14:48,179 --> 0:14:59,29
Can you sing the bass pitch?
 


335
0:14:59,29 --> 0:15:0,889
Now we can.
 


336
0:15:0,889 --> 0:15:4,61
>
 


337
0:15:4,61 --> 0:15:5,693
Prof: Well,
it's difficult;


338
0:15:5,693 --> 0:15:6,22
it's not easy.
 


339
0:15:6,22 --> 0:15:7,82
Can you pick out the--no.
 


340
0:15:7,82 --> 0:15:9,95
I was having trouble picking
out the bass.


341
0:15:9,95 --> 0:15:12,634
They're so--sometimes you can
do it, and sometimes you can't


342
0:15:12,634 --> 0:15:13,0
do it.
 


343
0:15:13,0 --> 0:15:15,948
We're going to focus now on
some passages where we can do


344
0:15:15,948 --> 0:15:19,4
it, and we're going to see how
Beethoven is setting up some


345
0:15:19,4 --> 0:15:20,48
chord progressions here.
 


346
0:15:20,48 --> 0:15:23,2
So here we've got--let's see.
 


347
0:15:23,2 --> 0:15:27,149
We've got some chords set out
and we're going to--


348
0:15:27,149 --> 0:15:32,785
we've got some chords set out
here and we're in the key of C


349
0:15:32,785 --> 0:15:35,643
at this point,
and we're going to hear


350
0:15:35,643 --> 0:15:38,831
Beethoven go to a tonic chord,
then a sub-dominant chord,


351
0:15:38,831 --> 0:15:42,418
then a tonic chord,
then a dominant chord and so on.


352
0:15:42,418 --> 0:15:45,327
We're just going to watch and
listen to--maybe even sing along


353
0:15:45,327 --> 0:15:47,139
with--the bass as he changes
chords.


354
0:15:47,139 --> 0:15:54,9
>
 


355
0:15:54,9 --> 0:16:24,35
>
 


356
0:16:24,35 --> 0:16:30,27
And let's work--we'll hear that
again, but as you can see


357
0:16:30,27 --> 0:16:32,155
>
 


358
0:16:32,155 --> 0:16:36,82
and then hold on that
>


359
0:16:36,82 --> 0:16:40,9
and then the changes came a
little bit faster and faster.


360
0:16:40,9 --> 0:16:41,538
So let's listen to that again.
 


361
0:16:41,538 --> 0:16:45,932
And we will then get over to
here, where he's sitting on the


362
0:16:45,932 --> 0:16:50,621
tonic chord, and we want to see
how long he's going to hold this


363
0:16:50,621 --> 0:16:51,514
tonic chord.
 


364
0:16:51,514 --> 0:16:52,259
Okay?
 


365
0:16:52,259 --> 0:16:55,33
>
 


366
0:16:55,33 --> 0:17:3,84
>
 


367
0:17:3,84 --> 0:17:6,753
Irregular, huh,
because we held a long time


368
0:17:6,753 --> 0:17:7,309
there.
 


369
0:17:7,309 --> 0:17:10,539
Now, moving faster.
 


370
0:17:10,539 --> 0:17:17,609
>
 


371
0:17:17,609 --> 0:17:18,92
Sing.
 


372
0:17:18,92 --> 0:17:20,509
>
 


373
0:17:20,509 --> 0:17:21,38
Sing with me.
 


374
0:17:21,38 --> 0:17:36,98
>
 


375
0:17:36,98 --> 0:17:38,66
Okay.
 


376
0:17:38,66 --> 0:17:41,376
So he's up to something here
with this rate of harmonic


377
0:17:41,376 --> 0:17:41,828
change.
 


378
0:17:41,828 --> 0:17:43,798
We almost fell asleep on that
tonic chord.


379
0:17:43,798 --> 0:17:47,0
He's doing the opposite of what
Mozart did.


380
0:17:47,0 --> 0:17:50,157
He's trying to relax us here by
slowing down the rate of


381
0:17:50,157 --> 0:17:51,48
harmonic change here.
 


382
0:17:51,48 --> 0:17:53,92
That held for about thirty
seconds, that tonic chord.


383
0:17:53,92 --> 0:17:57,49
Almost all classical music
involves irregular rates of


384
0:17:57,49 --> 0:18:0,855
harmonic change,
a point I think will become


385
0:18:0,855 --> 0:18:4,46
apparent later on,
but that is perhaps why this is


386
0:18:4,46 --> 0:18:8,519
the Pastoral Symphony--
this idea of being relaxed,


387
0:18:8,519 --> 0:18:12,9
being outdoors among the--
amidst nature and being in a


388
0:18:12,9 --> 0:18:15,96
very relaxed sort of state of
mind.


389
0:18:15,96 --> 0:18:20,848
The rate of harmonic change has
slowed down considerably here.


390
0:18:20,848 --> 0:18:21,49
Okay.
 


391
0:18:21,49 --> 0:18:26,608
Now for the rest of the session
today,


392
0:18:26,608 --> 0:18:30,981
what I'd like to do is take
examples from the realm of pop


393
0:18:30,981 --> 0:18:35,815
music and use them as paradigms
for what happens in the world of


394
0:18:35,815 --> 0:18:37,349
classical music.
 


395
0:18:37,349 --> 0:18:38,96
Why would I do that?
 


396
0:18:38,96 --> 0:18:41,896
Why, when dealing with harmony
and bass lines,


397
0:18:41,896 --> 0:18:45,878
do I want to start by focusing
on popular music and then apply


398
0:18:45,878 --> 0:18:48,49
those principles to classical
music?


399
0:18:48,49 --> 0:18:52,29
What does pop music do for us
that's very helpful?


400
0:18:52,29 --> 0:18:52,99
Marcus?
 


401
0:18:52,99 --> 0:18:54,47
Student: It's,
like, very regular.


402
0:18:54,47 --> 0:18:55,332
Prof: Okay.
 


403
0:18:55,332 --> 0:18:57,25
It's not like;
it is very regular,


404
0:18:57,25 --> 0:18:57,73
Marcus.
 


405
0:18:57,73 --> 0:19:0,48
I'm always telling my kids,
"Don't like"--no.


406
0:19:0,48 --> 0:19:3,103
It is indeed very
regular--So it is indeed very


407
0:19:3,103 --> 0:19:6,553
regular so that's one thing,
and by regular we mean these


408
0:19:6,553 --> 0:19:8,99
patterns keep repeating again
and again.


409
0:19:8,99 --> 0:19:10,23
So Marcus is absolutely right.
 


410
0:19:10,23 --> 0:19:13,95
That's the big-ticket
item--it's regular.


411
0:19:13,95 --> 0:19:17,406
It oftentimes repeats and it
can be symmetrical in that


412
0:19:17,406 --> 0:19:17,92
sense.
 


413
0:19:17,92 --> 0:19:19,519
Another observation?
 


414
0:19:19,519 --> 0:19:21,278
Roger?
 


415
0:19:21,278 --> 0:19:27,328
Student:
>


416
0:19:27,328 --> 0:19:28,236
Prof: Okay.
 


417
0:19:28,236 --> 0:19:28,488
Yeah.
 


418
0:19:28,488 --> 0:19:29,95
It's--that's another point.
 


419
0:19:29,95 --> 0:19:33,717
It's more obvious because there
are probably fewer lines there,


420
0:19:33,717 --> 0:19:36,209
so that you can focus on the
primary line,


421
0:19:36,209 --> 0:19:38,31
the basic line--the bass line.
 


422
0:19:38,31 --> 0:19:38,64
Yeah.
 


423
0:19:38,64 --> 0:19:42,14
So there's--it's probably
simpler in that sense.


424
0:19:42,14 --> 0:19:44,67
Any other observations?
 


425
0:19:44,67 --> 0:19:48,19
Well, here's one other that you
might not have thought of,


426
0:19:48,19 --> 0:19:52,383
and that is that most of the
chords in rock music in


427
0:19:52,383 --> 0:19:56,318
particular tend to be
root-position chords,


428
0:19:56,318 --> 0:19:59,63
and for that reason they're
easier to hear.


429
0:19:59,63 --> 0:20:2,17
When you start getting
inversion, "what note is


430
0:20:2,17 --> 0:20:4,96
it, what chord is it,"
that obfuscates the issue.


431
0:20:4,96 --> 0:20:8,513
So because so much popular
music and particularly rock


432
0:20:8,513 --> 0:20:12,605
music has those chords in root
position we can track them more


433
0:20:12,605 --> 0:20:13,41
readily.
 


434
0:20:13,41 --> 0:20:15,538
And then finally we could add
that--


435
0:20:15,538 --> 0:20:19,487
the idea that maybe with a lot
of electronic basses and things


436
0:20:19,487 --> 0:20:23,249
like that that they play--
they tend to play the bass just


437
0:20:23,249 --> 0:20:23,689
louder.
 


438
0:20:23,689 --> 0:20:24,13
Okay?
 


439
0:20:24,13 --> 0:20:27,463
So all of these factors,
particularly the idea of


440
0:20:27,463 --> 0:20:29,41
regularity and repetition.
 


441
0:20:29,41 --> 0:20:36,549
So let's take a couple of
examples here.


442
0:20:36,549 --> 0:20:39,89
Okay. I think we have something.
 


443
0:20:39,89 --> 0:20:43,45
I've chosen something called
Badly Drawn Boy.


444
0:20:43,45 --> 0:20:44,64
I had this in my collection.
 


445
0:20:44,64 --> 0:20:46,5
Anybody ever heard of this?
 


446
0:20:46,5 --> 0:20:47,86
Is--okay.
 


447
0:20:47,86 --> 0:20:47,674
One, two.
 


448
0:20:47,674 --> 0:20:49,44
This is not--okay,
three.


449
0:20:49,44 --> 0:20:52,111
So this is--is that--is it
"Badly Drawn Boys"


450
0:20:52,111 --> 0:20:53,15
or "Boy"?
 


451
0:20:53,15 --> 0:20:56,279
Boy. What? Singular. Okay.
 


452
0:20:56,279 --> 0:20:58,89
We're going to hear just a few
seconds of this.


453
0:20:58,89 --> 0:21:2,846
See if you can determine how
many chords we have


454
0:21:2,846 --> 0:21:6,13
here--whether we have a chord
change.


455
0:21:6,13 --> 0:21:9,493
If so, how many chords are
involved in this chord change


456
0:21:9,493 --> 0:21:12,859
and are they changing at a
regular or irregular rate?


457
0:21:12,859 --> 0:21:38,619
>
 


458
0:21:38,619 --> 0:21:39,769
What about that?
 


459
0:21:39,769 --> 0:21:42,64
Regular or irregular?
 


460
0:21:42,64 --> 0:21:43,88
Student: Is it regular?
 


461
0:21:43,88 --> 0:21:44,32
Prof: Regular,
yeah.


462
0:21:44,32 --> 0:21:45,41
>
 


463
0:21:45,41 --> 0:21:47,98
And then we go on to the next
one.


464
0:21:47,98 --> 0:21:49,21
And how many chords were
involved there?


465
0:21:49,21 --> 0:21:51,598
Difference of opinion.
 


466
0:21:51,598 --> 0:22:2,279
So how many--well,
let's hear it again.


467
0:22:2,279 --> 0:22:13,25
>
 


468
0:22:13,25 --> 0:22:23,21
>
 


469
0:22:23,21 --> 0:22:26,69
So two, yeah. Regular?
 


470
0:22:26,69 --> 0:22:27,308
Student:
>


471
0:22:27,308 --> 0:22:29,503
Prof: So we have just
two chords here,


472
0:22:29,503 --> 0:22:31,65
just changing back and forth
between two.


473
0:22:31,65 --> 0:22:36,95
Here is another example:
Justin Timberlake.


474
0:22:36,95 --> 0:22:39,25
Sorry, but it's a good example.
 


475
0:22:39,25 --> 0:22:40,329
Let's listen to this.
 


476
0:22:40,329 --> 0:22:41,799
How many chords are involved?
 


477
0:22:41,799 --> 0:22:44,339
Regular or irregular?
 


478
0:22:44,339 --> 0:23:8,9
>
 


479
0:23:8,9 --> 0:23:12,15
>
 


480
0:23:12,15 --> 0:23:14,74
Regular or irregular?
 


481
0:23:14,74 --> 0:23:16,5
Hmm?
 


482
0:23:16,5 --> 0:23:17,92
How many think regular?
 


483
0:23:17,92 --> 0:23:19,338
Raise your right hand.
 


484
0:23:19,338 --> 0:23:21,46
Raise your left hand if you
think it's irregular.


485
0:23:21,46 --> 0:23:24,29
Yeah, it's regular,
and with-- each chord was


486
0:23:24,29 --> 0:23:26,66
holding for two beats there in
duple meter.


487
0:23:26,66 --> 0:23:28,308
How many chords were there
altogether?


488
0:23:28,308 --> 0:23:32,48
Yeah, I think there were four
chords there so we had change.


489
0:23:32,48 --> 0:23:33,46
Yes, there was change.
 


490
0:23:33,46 --> 0:23:36,95
It was regular and it happened
to involve four chords.


491
0:23:36,95 --> 0:23:37,259
Okay.
 


492
0:23:37,259 --> 0:23:40,298
Pop music--we've been using
some pop music here.


493
0:23:40,298 --> 0:23:43,46
We've talked about why we use
the pop music.


494
0:23:43,46 --> 0:23:45,825
Let's talk about what the
difference between pop and


495
0:23:45,825 --> 0:23:46,798
classical music is.
 


496
0:23:46,798 --> 0:23:51,57
We've touched on this a little
bit before but let's play with


497
0:23:51,57 --> 0:23:51,98
this again.
 


498
0:23:51,98 --> 0:23:54,788
Let's say you go home for
Thanksgiving break and your


499
0:23:54,788 --> 0:23:57,327
grandmother says,
"What have you been doing


500
0:23:57,327 --> 0:23:58,298
at Yale?"
 


501
0:23:58,298 --> 0:24:0,182
"Well, I've been taking
this course on music and we've


502
0:24:0,182 --> 0:24:2,65
been studying classical music
and some popular music,"


503
0:24:2,65 --> 0:24:3,704
and she says,
"What's the difference?


504
0:24:3,704 --> 0:24:4,6
Tell me.
 


505
0:24:4,6 --> 0:24:6,116
What's the difference between
popular music and classical


506
0:24:6,116 --> 0:24:6,72
music?"
 


507
0:24:6,72 --> 0:24:9,358
How would you explain to your
grandmother what the difference


508
0:24:9,358 --> 0:24:9,578
is?
 


509
0:24:9,578 --> 0:24:12,981
Maybe six, seven,
eight different bullet points


510
0:24:12,981 --> 0:24:13,5
here.
 


511
0:24:13,5 --> 0:24:16,41
Who can get us started?
 


512
0:24:16,41 --> 0:24:18,588
We've talked about some of
these already,


513
0:24:18,588 --> 0:24:21,74
having to do with the nature of
the harmony--


514
0:24:21,74 --> 0:24:25,42
that pop music tends to have
simpler harmonies,


515
0:24:25,42 --> 0:24:28,308
and that those harmonies tend
to be more repetitious,


516
0:24:28,308 --> 0:24:33,105
that they tend to have
harmonies that have chords in


517
0:24:33,105 --> 0:24:34,608
root position.
 


518
0:24:34,608 --> 0:24:37,678
And here is one other thing you
might not think of and then I'm


519
0:24:37,678 --> 0:24:40,5
going to stop and I'm going to
let you add things here.


520
0:24:40,5 --> 0:24:43,821
They tend to be just triads
whereas in classical music


521
0:24:43,821 --> 0:24:45,64
>
 


522
0:24:45,64 --> 0:24:48,45
we can have a triad but we can
also add a seventh note with


523
0:24:48,45 --> 0:24:49,0
>
 


524
0:24:49,0 --> 0:24:53,64
one, three, five,
seven, nine,


525
0:24:53,64 --> 0:24:58,279
eleven, that kind of thing.
 


526
0:24:58,279 --> 0:25:1,228
It gets more dissonant,
the more notes that you add


527
0:25:1,228 --> 0:25:1,7
there.
 


528
0:25:1,7 --> 0:25:5,73
So classical music does involve
more complex chords.


529
0:25:5,73 --> 0:25:11,609
Okay. What else here?
 


530
0:25:11,609 --> 0:25:14,23
Oscar.
 


531
0:25:14,23 --> 0:25:16,259
Student: Pop music tends
to have a vocal part?


532
0:25:16,259 --> 0:25:18,539
Prof: Pop music tends to
have a vocal part.


533
0:25:18,539 --> 0:25:20,298
Why?
 


534
0:25:20,298 --> 0:25:24,63
Student: Maybe it wants
to be popular.


535
0:25:24,63 --> 0:25:26,39
Prof: Well,
because it wants to be popular.


536
0:25:26,39 --> 0:25:28,118
>
 


537
0:25:28,118 --> 0:25:30,348
There may be a circular
argument there.


538
0:25:30,348 --> 0:25:33,115
Well, okay, but if you're going
to have a singer,


539
0:25:33,115 --> 0:25:35,48
what's that singer going to be
singing?


540
0:25:35,48 --> 0:25:36,22
Student: A melody.
 


541
0:25:36,22 --> 0:25:38,509
Prof: A melody?
 


542
0:25:38,509 --> 0:25:41,608
Well, but classical music has
melody.


543
0:25:41,608 --> 0:25:44,118
We have a violinist play a
melody.


544
0:25:44,118 --> 0:25:47,646
If we have a singer,
the singer's going to be


545
0:25:47,646 --> 0:25:49,9
singing a text.
 


546
0:25:49,9 --> 0:25:49,301
Right?
 


547
0:25:49,301 --> 0:25:52,29
And we talked about this
before--that classical music,


548
0:25:52,29 --> 0:25:54,58
probably eighty-five percent of
it,


549
0:25:54,58 --> 0:25:57,518
does not involve a text,
and that's a whole different


550
0:25:57,518 --> 0:26:1,308
ballgame because then you have
to communicate meaning in a


551
0:26:1,308 --> 0:26:3,769
completely different sort of
way.


552
0:26:3,769 --> 0:26:7,545
Maybe you communicate meaning
by slowing down your harmonic


553
0:26:7,545 --> 0:26:11,19
motion to make us feel relaxed
so that each of these--


554
0:26:11,19 --> 0:26:14,412
with pop music you have--you
know what the thing means


555
0:26:14,412 --> 0:26:18,314
principally because of the text,
but with the classical music


556
0:26:18,314 --> 0:26:21,798
you've got these sort of
subliminal symbols in there,


557
0:26:21,798 --> 0:26:25,16
subliminal signifiers that we
got to pick up on.


558
0:26:25,16 --> 0:26:26,858
And we'll be talking more and
more about that.


559
0:26:26,858 --> 0:26:29,175
So we do have--that's a very
important point that Oscar


560
0:26:29,175 --> 0:26:29,818
raises there.
 


561
0:26:29,818 --> 0:26:34,605
We've got text in pop music
that tells us what this music


562
0:26:34,605 --> 0:26:35,289
means.
 


563
0:26:35,289 --> 0:26:37,48
Anything else?
 


564
0:26:37,48 --> 0:26:42,17
Carolyn.
 


565
0:26:42,17 --> 0:26:48,0
Student:
>


566
0:26:48,0 --> 0:26:49,12
Prof: Okay.
 


567
0:26:49,12 --> 0:26:51,548
If you go to hear a symphony of
mid-Beethoven,


568
0:26:51,548 --> 0:26:54,759
on-- each movement will
probably last fifteen minutes.


569
0:26:54,759 --> 0:26:57,556
If you put on a CD,
we could have-- what's the


570
0:26:57,556 --> 0:27:1,286
timing on the Justin Timberlake
thing there or any one of the


571
0:27:1,286 --> 0:27:1,97
tracks?
 


572
0:27:1,97 --> 0:27:3,839
Pick up the "Duke of
Earl" one there.


573
0:27:3,839 --> 0:27:5,91
Do they give us timings?
 


574
0:27:5,91 --> 0:27:6,198
Okay.
 


575
0:27:6,198 --> 0:27:9,25
I can't read it but two minutes
and fifty seconds,


576
0:27:9,25 --> 0:27:12,372
two minutes--this one's only
two minutes, three minutes and


577
0:27:12,372 --> 0:27:14,68
twenty seconds,
that kind of thing.


578
0:27:14,68 --> 0:27:16,94
They're short,
whereas Beethoven,


579
0:27:16,94 --> 0:27:19,13
as mentioned,
is much longer.


580
0:27:19,13 --> 0:27:23,64
What does that opportunity of
length provide us?


581
0:27:23,64 --> 0:27:28,89
It provides us the opportunity
to be more diversified in terms


582
0:27:28,89 --> 0:27:30,58
of the mood of the music.
 


583
0:27:30,58 --> 0:27:35,0
So in classical music you can
have rather wide mood swings.


584
0:27:35,0 --> 0:27:38,618
Remember we had in that one
piece <<plays


585
0:27:38,618 --> 0:27:39,798
piano>>
 


586
0:27:39,798 --> 0:27:43,259
and then <<plays
piano>>


587
0:27:43,259 --> 0:27:45,729
there was a modulation tying
them together,


588
0:27:45,729 --> 0:27:48,608
but those were completely
different sentiments.


589
0:27:48,608 --> 0:27:52,654
Usually, with a piece of
popular music you get a single


590
0:27:52,654 --> 0:27:54,756
ethos,
a single feeling,


591
0:27:54,756 --> 0:27:58,279
a single mood associated with
the piece,


592
0:27:58,279 --> 0:28:1,358
and the piece will tend to be
shorter.


593
0:28:1,358 --> 0:28:4,276
Any more that we could push on
that?


594
0:28:4,276 --> 0:28:4,858
Yeah.
 


595
0:28:4,858 --> 0:28:8,369
Student:
>


596
0:28:8,369 --> 0:28:10,7
Prof: Okay. That's--yeah.
 


597
0:28:10,7 --> 0:28:12,38
Most classical music is written
down.


598
0:28:12,38 --> 0:28:13,838
We've talked--we spent a lot of
time talking about that--


599
0:28:13,838 --> 0:28:16,548
the most popular music,
virtually all of it--


600
0:28:16,548 --> 0:28:19,38
although after the fact people
try to write it down.


601
0:28:19,38 --> 0:28:23,39
You can go buy a score of the
Beatles,


602
0:28:23,39 --> 0:28:27,201
for example--although they
didn't design this initially


603
0:28:27,201 --> 0:28:29,484
with music,
but after the fact,


604
0:28:29,484 --> 0:28:32,69
people sort of listen to it and
make written--


605
0:28:32,69 --> 0:28:36,215
put in written form what had
originally been just an aurally


606
0:28:36,215 --> 0:28:38,69
conceived artistic statement.
 


607
0:28:38,69 --> 0:28:40,38
Anything else? Roger?
 


608
0:28:40,38 --> 0:28:46,19
Student:
>


609
0:28:46,19 --> 0:28:47,63
Prof: Yeah.
 


610
0:28:47,63 --> 0:28:50,22
Oh, so we've got the difference
between acoustical instruments,


611
0:28:50,22 --> 0:28:52,945
which are sort of natural wood
and strings and that sort of


612
0:28:52,945 --> 0:28:55,39
thing,
and electronically amplified


613
0:28:55,39 --> 0:28:58,262
sound in which it might be sent
to a mixer or perhaps a


614
0:28:58,262 --> 0:29:1,903
synthesizer that could play with
those partials that we talked


615
0:29:1,903 --> 0:29:3,49
about,
and maybe turn a


616
0:29:3,49 --> 0:29:6,595
clarinet--somebody playing at a
keyboard and you want that


617
0:29:6,595 --> 0:29:8,608
keyboard to sound like a
trumpet,


618
0:29:8,608 --> 0:29:11,353
well, you just turn a mixing
board and you can get those


619
0:29:11,353 --> 0:29:13,48
pitches to sound like a trumpet.
 


620
0:29:13,48 --> 0:29:15,159
Or, for example,
let's say you're Cher and


621
0:29:15,159 --> 0:29:18,4
you're getting in to your early
sixties and you really can't hit


622
0:29:18,4 --> 0:29:21,731
that high note anymore;
you can get electronically that


623
0:29:21,731 --> 0:29:23,798
particular sound to be enhanced.
 


624
0:29:23,798 --> 0:29:25,47
And let's say you can't hold
that.


625
0:29:25,47 --> 0:29:28,817
Let's say Pavarotti at the end
of his life couldn't hold notes


626
0:29:28,817 --> 0:29:31,672
as long as he could when he was
recording in nineteen


627
0:29:31,672 --> 0:29:32,66
seventy-eight.
 


628
0:29:32,66 --> 0:29:35,567
Well, you can just--an engineer
will just sit there and isolate


629
0:29:35,567 --> 0:29:38,334
that second of sound and then
give a "times three"


630
0:29:38,334 --> 0:29:40,21
command and "boom,"
well,


631
0:29:40,21 --> 0:29:42,9
look at Pavarotti hold out that
note.


632
0:29:42,9 --> 0:29:45,588
Well, it's the miracle of the
engineer and not the singer.


633
0:29:45,588 --> 0:29:49,107
So there are a lot of
acoustical things and sort of


634
0:29:49,107 --> 0:29:52,486
tricks of synthetic things going
on in pop music.


635
0:29:52,486 --> 0:29:53,118
Yeah.
 


636
0:29:53,118 --> 0:29:56,392
Student: Well,
not just the chord progression


637
0:29:56,392 --> 0:29:58,828
but also the structure of the
piece.


638
0:29:58,828 --> 0:30:2,279
Like in popular music there's
often a couple of verses and a


639
0:30:2,279 --> 0:30:5,906
chorus and a bridge and you can
predict each different movement


640
0:30:5,906 --> 0:30:10,19
of the piece,
and that's more regular than--


641
0:30:10,19 --> 0:30:11,65
Prof: Couldn't say it
better myself.


642
0:30:11,65 --> 0:30:14,568
Say that nice and loud so
everyone can hear it.


643
0:30:14,568 --> 0:30:18,43
Student: The structure
of a popular piece is often more


644
0:30:18,43 --> 0:30:22,38
predictable in pattern and
verses and bridges and choruses


645
0:30:22,38 --> 0:30:25,961
whereas with classical music you
really can't predict what part


646
0:30:25,961 --> 0:30:29,569
of the movement you're at as
well as you can with--


647
0:30:29,569 --> 0:30:30,71
Prof: Right. Exactly.
 


648
0:30:30,71 --> 0:30:33,538
It's not --and that ties in
with the harmony also,


649
0:30:33,538 --> 0:30:35,788
which is also a lot more
predictable.


650
0:30:35,788 --> 0:30:38,288
And so generally speaking what
we end up with classical


651
0:30:38,288 --> 0:30:39,91
music-it's much more
diversified.


652
0:30:39,91 --> 0:30:40,97
It's much more varied.
 


653
0:30:40,97 --> 0:30:42,22
It's much more complex.
 


654
0:30:42,22 --> 0:30:44,63
We've got contrapuntal lines
operating in it.


655
0:30:44,63 --> 0:30:48,29
It has the capacity for
expansion.


656
0:30:48,29 --> 0:30:52,595
It can take us through the full
panoply of human emotions within


657
0:30:52,595 --> 0:30:54,769
one particular composition..
 


658
0:30:54,769 --> 0:30:58,25
And it perhaps allows the
opportunity for more personal


659
0:30:58,25 --> 0:31:0,757
interpretation,
"exactly what does this


660
0:31:0,757 --> 0:31:3,64
music mean,"
more personal interpretation,


661
0:31:3,64 --> 0:31:5,73
because we're not tied to a
text;


662
0:31:5,73 --> 0:31:7,961
we're not linked in to a
particular text that tells us


663
0:31:7,961 --> 0:31:8,72
what it's about.
 


664
0:31:8,72 --> 0:31:12,66
So those are just a few ideas
as we pursue this.


665
0:31:12,66 --> 0:31:16,753
Well, what I'd like to do now
is move here to a couple of


666
0:31:16,753 --> 0:31:19,912
additional pieces,
and we're going to use an


667
0:31:19,912 --> 0:31:24,0
example of pop music now with a
three-chord chord progression.


668
0:31:24,0 --> 0:31:27,364
We've heard I guess it was
Badly Drawn Boy--Boys there with


669
0:31:27,364 --> 0:31:29,22
a two-chord chord progression.
 


670
0:31:29,22 --> 0:31:31,769
Now we're going to hear Beach
Boys, I guess,


671
0:31:31,769 --> 0:31:35,92
with a three-chord chord
progression and it's going to be


672
0:31:35,92 --> 0:31:36,93
sub-dominant (IV),
dominant (V),


673
0:31:36,93 --> 0:31:37,88
tonic (I).
 


674
0:31:37,88 --> 0:31:40,21
Is it regular or irregular?
 


675
0:31:40,21 --> 0:31:47,799
>
 


676
0:31:47,799 --> 0:31:48,809
And try to sing the bass.
 


677
0:31:48,809 --> 0:32:5,98
 
 


678
0:32:5,98 --> 0:32:7,48
Can you sing that bass?
 


679
0:32:7,48 --> 0:32:8,39
You sing it for me.
 


680
0:32:8,39 --> 0:32:9,539
Here's the tonic.
 


681
0:32:9,539 --> 0:32:10,369
>
 


682
0:32:10,369 --> 0:32:13,42
>
 


683
0:32:13,42 --> 0:32:15,14
Good.
 


684
0:32:15,14 --> 0:32:17,69
Good. Louder. That's it.
 


685
0:32:17,69 --> 0:32:19,23
>
 


686
0:32:19,23 --> 0:32:19,458
Okay.
 


687
0:32:19,458 --> 0:32:21,652
So that's all you got to do,
and you can hear the


688
0:32:21,652 --> 0:32:22,75
>
 


689
0:32:22,75 --> 0:32:25,657
holding for twice as long as
the other, so you got irregular


690
0:32:25,657 --> 0:32:26,94
rate of harmonic change.
 


691
0:32:26,94 --> 0:32:29,48
So that's I, IV, V, I.
 


692
0:32:29,48 --> 0:32:34,42
And let's go to a little bit
more of Beethoven.


693
0:32:34,42 --> 0:32:37,21
We're going to go now to the
last movement of his


694
0:32:37,21 --> 0:32:39,477
Pastoral Symphony,
and I keep hitting on the


695
0:32:39,477 --> 0:32:41,24
Pastoral Symphony 'cause
in two weeks--


696
0:32:41,24 --> 0:32:43,858
or maybe three weeks--we're
going to go hear,


697
0:32:43,858 --> 0:32:46,917
I guess, the Saybrook Orchestra
play the Pastoral


698
0:32:46,917 --> 0:32:47,529
Symphony.
 


699
0:32:47,529 --> 0:32:50,83
So I'm spending a little extra
time on the Pastoral


700
0:32:50,83 --> 0:32:50,798
Symphony here.
 


701
0:32:50,798 --> 0:32:53,868
And the last movement opens
with this sort of sound.


702
0:32:53,868 --> 0:32:59,5
We have these pitches
>


703
0:32:59,5 --> 0:33:3,513
and all listen and then you can
tell me what instrument is


704
0:33:3,513 --> 0:33:4,43
playing it.
 


705
0:33:4,43 --> 0:33:6,461
So we have those sorts of
sounds <<plays


706
0:33:6,461 --> 0:33:7,14
piano>>
 


707
0:33:7,14 --> 0:33:9,903
and then another instrument
will come in with <<plays


708
0:33:9,903 --> 0:33:10,619
piano>>
 


709
0:33:10,619 --> 0:33:12,94
and play that.
 


710
0:33:12,94 --> 0:33:15,246
It's all--these are all notes
of a C triad,


711
0:33:15,246 --> 0:33:16,509
>
 


712
0:33:16,509 --> 0:33:27,278
C, E, G, C, E,
all notes of a C triad.


713
0:33:27,278 --> 0:33:30,336
Now we happen to be in the key
of F here so that means he's


714
0:33:30,336 --> 0:33:34,165
starting out with the dominant,
which gets us to the point that


715
0:33:34,165 --> 0:33:37,91
all pieces have to end in the
tonic one way or another,


716
0:33:37,91 --> 0:33:39,92
but not all pieces begin with
the tonic.


717
0:33:39,92 --> 0:33:42,318
So this one happens to begin
with a sort of dominant chord.


718
0:33:42,318 --> 0:33:44,72
So this is a little bit of
dominant preparation.


719
0:33:44,72 --> 0:33:47,779
>
 


720
0:33:47,779 --> 0:33:50,9
So tell me what instruments are
playing here.


721
0:33:50,9 --> 0:34:7,4
>
 


722
0:34:7,4 --> 0:34:11,159
And then the strings come in.
 


723
0:34:11,159 --> 0:34:12,76
So what was the first
instrument?


724
0:34:12,76 --> 0:34:14,48
Anybody pick that up,
on that one playing?


725
0:34:14,48 --> 0:34:18,121
On the quiz or test next week
or--on Thursday--we'll give you


726
0:34:18,121 --> 0:34:19,822
three--at least three plays.
 


727
0:34:19,822 --> 0:34:20,429
Robert?
 


728
0:34:20,429 --> 0:34:20,96
Student: Clarinet.
 


729
0:34:20,96 --> 0:34:22,1
Prof: Clarinet.
 


730
0:34:22,1 --> 0:34:24,208
Yes, it was a clarinet up
there, nice and high,


731
0:34:24,208 --> 0:34:26,742
and then another instrument
came in with <<plays


732
0:34:26,742 --> 0:34:27,65
piano>>.
 


733
0:34:27,65 --> 0:34:30,21
What instrument was that?
 


734
0:34:30,21 --> 0:34:34,954
French horn,
yeah, but notice that if we


735
0:34:34,954 --> 0:34:41,159
take this aggregate--
>


736
0:34:41,159 --> 0:34:44,289
and we're back to that same
idea of the octave,


737
0:34:44,289 --> 0:34:45,67
the fifth, the fourth and the
third,


738
0:34:45,67 --> 0:34:48,28
sort of, so it's again sort of
primordial,


739
0:34:48,28 --> 0:34:51,789
this particular acoustical
basis of so much of music.


740
0:34:51,789 --> 0:34:54,543
So that's our dominant
preparation and then the melody


741
0:34:54,543 --> 0:34:56,309
starts, so let's listen to this.
 


742
0:34:56,309 --> 0:34:57,659
Let me play it here a little
bit.


743
0:34:57,659 --> 0:35:9,36
>
 


744
0:35:9,36 --> 0:35:11,28
So it has a kind of
antecedent-consequent phrase


745
0:35:11,28 --> 0:35:13,121
structure with the <<plays
piano>>


746
0:35:13,121 --> 0:35:13,53
chord.
 


747
0:35:13,53 --> 0:35:15,905
Once we get up there,
that's sort of the end of the


748
0:35:15,905 --> 0:35:18,139
antecedent phrase and we have a
chord change.


749
0:35:18,139 --> 0:35:20,3
What we're working with here
are the same chords.


750
0:35:20,3 --> 0:35:23,11
We've sort of gone from the
Beach Boys to Beethoven here.


751
0:35:23,11 --> 0:35:25,699
We've got the same chords
operating.


752
0:35:25,699 --> 0:35:28,13
It's going to be a I chord,
then a IV chord,


753
0:35:28,13 --> 0:35:30,28
and we'll drop down to the IV
chord.


754
0:35:30,28 --> 0:35:32,59
Then we'll come to a V chord,
to a I chord,


755
0:35:32,59 --> 0:35:34,77
to a IV chord,
to a V chord,


756
0:35:34,77 --> 0:35:36,443
to a I chord,
just as we were doing with the


757
0:35:36,443 --> 0:35:37,38
Beach Boys.
 


758
0:35:37,38 --> 0:35:47,179
 
 


759
0:35:47,179 --> 0:35:48,69
We'll resuscitate Beethoven
here.


760
0:35:48,69 --> 0:35:50,469
>
 


761
0:35:50,469 --> 0:35:53,11
How many of you have ever heard
this before, while Lynda's


762
0:35:53,11 --> 0:35:53,989
getting this set?
 


763
0:35:53,989 --> 0:35:56,181
Let's see if we could sing it
together because we're going to


764
0:35:56,181 --> 0:35:57,679
do this in a different way in a
second.


765
0:35:57,679 --> 0:36:13,449
Let's sing >
 


766
0:36:13,449 --> 0:36:15,369
Okay. So let's sing this.
 


767
0:36:15,369 --> 0:36:20,505
That's the melody and we're
going to sing


768
0:36:20,505 --> 0:36:23,46
>
 


769
0:36:23,46 --> 0:36:26,365
beneath--we're going to sing
Beethoven's bass beneath


770
0:36:26,365 --> 0:36:27,539
Beethoven's melody.
 


771
0:36:27,539 --> 0:36:31,28
>
 


772
0:36:31,28 --> 0:36:31,614
Okay.
 


773
0:36:31,614 --> 0:36:32,82
This is the intro.
 


774
0:36:32,82 --> 0:36:33,625
That's fine.
 


775
0:36:33,625 --> 0:36:35,99
We'll listen to it.
 


776
0:36:35,99 --> 0:36:37,179
Here comes the horn.
 


777
0:36:37,179 --> 0:36:45,88
>
 


778
0:36:45,88 --> 0:37:33,949
>
 


779
0:37:33,949 --> 0:37:35,619
Okay.
 


780
0:37:35,619 --> 0:37:39,3
So that's an example of a
classical composer,


781
0:37:39,3 --> 0:37:41,659
admittedly in a pretty
straightforward situation,


782
0:37:41,659 --> 0:37:45,188
using the same three-chord
chord progressions we find in


783
0:37:45,188 --> 0:37:46,28
the Beach Boys.
 


784
0:37:46,28 --> 0:37:48,57
Let's enlarge this further.
 


785
0:37:48,57 --> 0:37:51,42
Let's move to a four-chord
chord progression.


786
0:37:51,42 --> 0:37:52,34
We're going to switch the board.
 


787
0:37:52,34 --> 0:37:56,17
 
 


788
0:37:56,17 --> 0:37:59,186
And we're going to go to the
kind of music that I grew up


789
0:37:59,186 --> 0:38:0,5
with as a kid.
 


790
0:38:0,5 --> 0:38:0,766
It's always fun.
 


791
0:38:0,766 --> 0:38:3,141
This is Gene Chandler and the
"Duke of Earl"


792
0:38:3,141 --> 0:38:5,875
so we're going to listen to a
little bit of it and we're going


793
0:38:5,875 --> 0:38:7,13
to chart the bass here.
 


794
0:38:7,13 --> 0:38:7,858
I'm trying to remember.
 


795
0:38:7,858 --> 0:38:9,51
I think actually it's in the
same key as Beethoven.


796
0:38:9,51 --> 0:38:18,98
>
 


797
0:38:18,98 --> 0:38:21,356
And then we'll see exactly what
it is that he's doing here so


798
0:38:21,356 --> 0:38:23,99
we're going to try to lock in on
the bass.


799
0:38:23,99 --> 0:38:24,5
Here we go.
 


800
0:38:24,5 --> 0:38:27,5
>
 


801
0:38:27,5 --> 0:38:35,34
>
 


802
0:38:35,34 --> 0:38:36,8
So sing the bass with me.
 


803
0:38:36,8 --> 0:38:56,59
>
 


804
0:38:56,59 --> 0:38:59,829
So we've got four chords
operating here and they're


805
0:38:59,829 --> 0:39:1,19
changing regularly.
 


806
0:39:1,19 --> 0:39:2,55
What are those four chords?
 


807
0:39:2,55 --> 0:39:4,768
Well, we talked a little bit
about this before.


808
0:39:4,768 --> 0:39:8,521
Now we have what's called a VI
chord and we're not moving


809
0:39:8,521 --> 0:39:12,101
directly to the IV chord;
we're moving to another


810
0:39:12,101 --> 0:39:16,11
chord--here a VI chord,
>


811
0:39:16,11 --> 0:39:18,23
which happens to be a minor
chord.


812
0:39:18,23 --> 0:39:20,3
>
 


813
0:39:20,3 --> 0:39:21,949
There's the IV chord
>


814
0:39:21,949 --> 0:39:23,38
and there's [V}-- <<plays
piano>>


815
0:39:23,38 --> 0:39:24,789
back to the I here.
 


816
0:39:24,789 --> 0:39:26,82
So you sing this nice and loud
for me, please.


817
0:39:26,82 --> 0:39:27,681
>
 


818
0:39:27,681 --> 0:39:28,46
There's the tonic.
 


819
0:39:28,46 --> 0:39:29,389
Ready, go.
 


820
0:39:29,389 --> 0:39:30,8
>
 


821
0:39:30,8 --> 0:39:32,1
>
 


822
0:39:32,1 --> 0:39:35,79
Good.
 


823
0:39:35,79 --> 0:39:38,59
One more time.
 


824
0:39:38,59 --> 0:39:40,99
> Louder.
 


825
0:39:40,99 --> 0:39:44,98
>
 


826
0:39:44,98 --> 0:39:45,18
>
 


827
0:39:45,18 --> 0:39:45,422
Okay.
 


828
0:39:45,422 --> 0:39:49,371
Now watch what happens as we
continue with this I,


829
0:39:49,371 --> 0:39:51,63
VI, IV, V, I progression.
 


830
0:39:51,63 --> 0:39:54,909
Do we have a regular or
irregular rate of change here?


831
0:39:54,909 --> 0:39:56,44
Let's go on to the next section.
 


832
0:39:56,44 --> 0:40:0,909
>
 


833
0:40:0,909 --> 0:40:17,51
>
 


834
0:40:17,51 --> 0:40:35,619
I, VI, IV, V, I, VI, IV, V.
 


835
0:40:35,619 --> 0:40:40,389
So what happened in that middle
section?


836
0:40:40,389 --> 0:40:41,82
Yeah.
 


837
0:40:41,82 --> 0:40:45,55
Student:
>


838
0:40:45,55 --> 0:40:47,9
Prof: Good. Yeah.
 


839
0:40:47,9 --> 0:40:52,8
If we are >
 


840
0:40:52,8 --> 0:40:54,896
and then it went on and on and
on, longer, longer,


841
0:40:54,896 --> 0:40:56,61
longer, and then
>


842
0:40:56,61 --> 0:40:58,579
but it was the same pattern.
 


843
0:40:58,579 --> 0:41:3,322
They just elongated each
measure by its same amount so we


844
0:41:3,322 --> 0:41:6,71
had harmony changing on each
measure,


845
0:41:6,71 --> 0:41:9,956
and then in that middle section
each chord was changing at the


846
0:41:9,956 --> 0:41:11,179
rate of two measures.
 


847
0:41:11,179 --> 0:41:13,994
So the whole piece,
then, would be a piece


848
0:41:13,994 --> 0:41:17,84
involving irregular rate of
change-- the entire piece.


849
0:41:17,84 --> 0:41:18,201
Okay.
 


850
0:41:18,201 --> 0:41:21,813
So that's the "Duke of
Earl" progression:


851
0:41:21,813 --> 0:41:23,909
the basic I,
VI, IV, V, I.


852
0:41:23,909 --> 0:41:28,429
Now we'll play a passage of
Mozart--a symphony by Mozart


853
0:41:28,429 --> 0:41:32,949
here that he wrote at the ripe
old age of nine years.


854
0:41:32,949 --> 0:41:36,26
This is Mozart at age nine.
 


855
0:41:36,26 --> 0:41:38,485
He had actually written a
couple of symphonies by this


856
0:41:38,485 --> 0:41:38,78
time.
 


857
0:41:38,78 --> 0:41:40,494
This is his Symphony No.
 


858
0:41:40,494 --> 0:41:43,139
5 in B-flat so let's listen to
this.


859
0:41:43,139 --> 0:41:46,811
We're just going to listen and
see if anything strikes you as


860
0:41:46,811 --> 0:41:47,67
interesting.
 


861
0:41:47,67 --> 0:42:18,679
>
 


862
0:42:18,679 --> 0:42:21,315
I think we just should keep
right on going just to get the


863
0:42:21,315 --> 0:42:22,1
point across.
 


864
0:42:22,1 --> 0:42:23,61
We'll just let it run.
 


865
0:42:23,61 --> 0:42:27,8
 
 


866
0:42:27,8 --> 0:42:31,4
>
 


867
0:42:31,4 --> 0:42:34,409
So you can sing this bass.
 


868
0:42:34,409 --> 0:42:43,18
>
 


869
0:42:43,18 --> 0:42:46,721
So that's Mozart using the
"Duke of Earl"


870
0:42:46,721 --> 0:42:48,349
harmony--not really.
 


871
0:42:48,349 --> 0:42:50,409
This is a point I brought up in
my section the other day.


872
0:42:50,409 --> 0:42:53,923
There are lots of legal cases
where people try to sue somebody


873
0:42:53,923 --> 0:42:56,516
else for stealing a song;
they try to sue them for


874
0:42:56,516 --> 0:42:58,46
stealing a bass line or
something like that.


875
0:42:58,46 --> 0:43:1,17
You can get away--you can sue
people for stealing melody.


876
0:43:1,17 --> 0:43:4,351
You can never--there's a strong
legal precedent for not being


877
0:43:4,351 --> 0:43:6,579
able to make a claim about
stolen bass,


878
0:43:6,579 --> 0:43:9,199
because these basses are
limited in number,


879
0:43:9,199 --> 0:43:11,76
they involve rather simple
harmonic progressions,


880
0:43:11,76 --> 0:43:13,518
and they've been used over the
centuries.


881
0:43:13,518 --> 0:43:15,478
It's not as if Gene Chandler
sat around here studying Mozart


882
0:43:15,478 --> 0:43:15,909
symphonies.
 


883
0:43:15,909 --> 0:43:16,449
I don't know.
 


884
0:43:16,449 --> 0:43:17,612
Maybe he did,
said, "Oh,


885
0:43:17,612 --> 0:43:19,11
I like that harmonic
progression.


886
0:43:19,11 --> 0:43:19,84
I'm going to use that
here."


887
0:43:19,84 --> 0:43:19,992
No.
 


888
0:43:19,992 --> 0:43:22,898
Everybody's been using that,
sort of since time immemorial


889
0:43:22,898 --> 0:43:25,9
or at least since the sixteenth
century.


890
0:43:25,9 --> 0:43:31,5
Now let's go on here to listen
to some music of Rossini--


891
0:43:31,5 --> 0:43:34,51
composer Gioachino Rossini--
coming after Mozart,


892
0:43:34,51 --> 0:43:37,11
and he likes chord progressions
too,


893
0:43:37,11 --> 0:43:41,16
so we're going to listen to a
passage of Rossini and see what


894
0:43:41,16 --> 0:43:43,619
he does by way of his chord
selection.


895
0:43:43,619 --> 0:43:46,514
So the point of this is:
once you get these kind of


896
0:43:46,514 --> 0:43:48,599
progressions locked in your
ears,


897
0:43:48,599 --> 0:43:53,367
you go to a concert and you can
begin to chart what the piece is


898
0:43:53,367 --> 0:43:55,789
doing in terms of its harmony.
 


899
0:43:55,789 --> 0:43:58,376
Yeah, you're not going to be
able to hear all of it and,


900
0:43:58,376 --> 0:44:0,679
indeed, you may not be able to
hear most of it.


901
0:44:0,679 --> 0:44:1,989
I don't hear most of it.
 


902
0:44:1,989 --> 0:44:3,818
But there are moments,
and they're moments that give


903
0:44:3,818 --> 0:44:5,11
me pleasure
>


904
0:44:5,11 --> 0:44:6,233
when I can say,
"Oh, yeah.


905
0:44:6,233 --> 0:44:7,619
That's what he's doing
there."


906
0:44:7,619 --> 0:44:9,48
I might not know what key he's
in.


907
0:44:9,48 --> 0:44:11,476
I don't really care what key
he's in 'cause I don't have


908
0:44:11,476 --> 0:44:13,643
absolute pitch,
but I can find well,


909
0:44:13,643 --> 0:44:17,52
maybe it's a I,
VI, IV, V, I chord progression


910
0:44:17,52 --> 0:44:20,309
or a I, V, I progression or I,
IV, V, I.


911
0:44:20,309 --> 0:44:22,94
We--you get different kinds of
patterns.


912
0:44:22,94 --> 0:44:26,699
A Pachelbel bass pattern is
another one.


913
0:44:26,699 --> 0:44:30,306
So let's listen to a pattern
that Rossini is using here in


914
0:44:30,306 --> 0:44:31,699
this opera overture.
 


915
0:44:31,699 --> 0:44:34,79
>
 


916
0:44:34,79 --> 0:44:38,25
So the first thing we got to do
is sort of lock on to the tonic.


917
0:44:38,25 --> 0:44:42,63
>
 


918
0:44:42,63 --> 0:44:46,329
>
 


919
0:44:46,329 --> 0:44:48,32
And it's taking me a while.
 


920
0:44:48,32 --> 0:44:51,71
It's taking me a while to lock
on to that tonic.


921
0:44:51,71 --> 0:44:52,407
I don't know.
 


922
0:44:52,407 --> 0:44:55,39
The bass isn't as loud as in
some of the pop music


923
0:44:55,39 --> 0:44:56,329
>
 


924
0:44:56,329 --> 0:44:58,789
but I think it--
>


925
0:44:58,789 --> 0:45:1,7
but I think that's what the
tonic is.


926
0:45:1,7 --> 0:45:4,456
So don't be--don't despair if
you don't initially land on the


927
0:45:4,456 --> 0:45:5,19
tonic here.
 


928
0:45:5,19 --> 0:45:7,409
It takes a while so--but I
think we've got it identified.


929
0:45:7,409 --> 0:45:8,159
>
 


930
0:45:8,159 --> 0:45:9,659
All right. Let's go on.
 


931
0:45:9,659 --> 0:45:13,639
>
 


932
0:45:13,639 --> 0:45:20,268
>
 


933
0:45:20,268 --> 0:45:24,139
So he went
>.


934
0:45:24,139 --> 0:45:25,869
What would you guess those two
chords are?


935
0:45:25,869 --> 0:45:27,239
We said this is the tonic.
 


936
0:45:27,239 --> 0:45:28,23
>
 


937
0:45:28,23 --> 0:45:31,57
The other one's probably going
to be the dominant.


938
0:45:31,57 --> 0:45:33,708
If you ever hear music rocking
back and forth repeatedly


939
0:45:33,708 --> 0:45:35,226
between two chords,
it's probably tonic,


940
0:45:35,226 --> 0:45:36,199
>
 


941
0:45:36,199 --> 0:45:37,32
dominant, tonic, dominant.
 


942
0:45:37,32 --> 0:45:38,86
Remember we had that even with
the Strauss.


943
0:45:38,86 --> 0:45:41,1
>
 


944
0:45:41,1 --> 0:45:42,862
The timpani played that tonic,
dominant, tonic,


945
0:45:42,862 --> 0:45:43,989
dominant, tonic,
dominant.


946
0:45:43,989 --> 0:45:46,286
So if you hear two chords
rocking, it's probably tonic and


947
0:45:46,286 --> 0:45:46,73
dominant.
 


948
0:45:46,73 --> 0:45:47,47
Okay.
 


949
0:45:47,47 --> 0:45:49,84
Let's see how he expands this a
little bit.


950
0:45:49,84 --> 0:45:56,51
>
 


951
0:45:56,51 --> 0:46:3,36
>
 


952
0:46:3,36 --> 0:46:4,739
So what was that?
 


953
0:46:4,739 --> 0:46:7,713
Well, that's the "Duke of
Earl" passage.


954
0:46:7,713 --> 0:46:8,199
Right?
 


955
0:46:8,199 --> 0:46:9,724
So we are sitting there in
Woolsey Hall with New Haven


956
0:46:9,724 --> 0:46:11,5
Symphony or whatever,
New York Philharmonic.


957
0:46:11,5 --> 0:46:11,557
"Oh, yeah.
 


958
0:46:11,557 --> 0:46:12,949
That's the 'Duke of Earl'
passage."


959
0:46:12,949 --> 0:46:16,867
So yes, it was the
>


960
0:46:16,867 --> 0:46:19,48
I, VI, IV, V,
I progression.


961
0:46:19,48 --> 0:46:20,1
All right.
 


962
0:46:20,1 --> 0:46:21,55
Let's see what happens next.
 


963
0:46:21,55 --> 0:46:26,44
>
 


964
0:46:26,44 --> 0:46:26,78
Okay.
 


965
0:46:26,78 --> 0:46:30,873
So what happened next was he
then started to run that faster,


966
0:46:30,873 --> 0:46:32,51
>
 


967
0:46:32,51 --> 0:46:34,918
twice as fast as it had been
before, changing rate of


968
0:46:34,918 --> 0:46:35,8
harmonic pattern.
 


969
0:46:35,8 --> 0:46:37,1
Okay?
 


970
0:46:37,1 --> 0:46:44,17
>
 


971
0:46:44,17 --> 0:46:49,429
What was that
>?


972
0:46:49,429 --> 0:46:51,36
What chord's there probably?
 


973
0:46:51,36 --> 0:46:53,75
Daniel, what do you think?
 


974
0:46:53,75 --> 0:46:55,59
What chord's there?
 


975
0:46:55,59 --> 0:46:56,4
Student: Dominant.
 


976
0:46:56,4 --> 0:46:59,686
Prof: Just dominant
time, >


977
0:46:59,686 --> 0:47:2,849
, going faster and faster,
and then what happens?


978
0:47:2,849 --> 0:47:5,719
>
 


979
0:47:5,719 --> 0:47:7,969
Sing the tonic.
 


980
0:47:7,969 --> 0:47:15,409
>
 


981
0:47:15,409 --> 0:47:17,329
The end of that was all just
the tonic.


982
0:47:17,329 --> 0:47:18,71
He just sat there on the tonic
forever.


983
0:47:18,71 --> 0:47:22,233
It's a good example of sort of
real time and psychological time


984
0:47:22,233 --> 0:47:22,86
in music.
 


985
0:47:22,86 --> 0:47:25,382
You knew it was time to start
clapping as soon as that chord


986
0:47:25,382 --> 0:47:27,5
hit that, <<plays
piano>>


987
0:47:27,5 --> 0:47:28,322
it stopped going back and
forth, tonic,


988
0:47:28,322 --> 0:47:29,36
dominant, just sitting there.
 


989
0:47:29,36 --> 0:47:30,46
That piece is over.
 


990
0:47:30,46 --> 0:47:33,443
The rest is just a big mud pie
in your face.


991
0:47:33,443 --> 0:47:33,929
Okay?
 


992
0:47:33,929 --> 0:47:35,599
It's just >
 


993
0:47:35,599 --> 0:47:38,615
tonic or maybe throwing an
anchor overboard to bring this


994
0:47:38,615 --> 0:47:40,914
ship to an end--
whatever sort of analogy or


995
0:47:40,914 --> 0:47:42,849
visual imagine you want to bring
to it,


996
0:47:42,849 --> 0:47:45,86
but it's--the piece has ended.
 


997
0:47:45,86 --> 0:47:48,0
Even though we are continuing
to hear sound,


998
0:47:48,0 --> 0:47:49,443
harmonically,
psychologically,


999
0:47:49,443 --> 0:47:52,53
we know we're finished when he
hits that particular tonic.


1000
0:47:52,53 --> 0:47:54,34
Okay. I think our time is up.
 


1001
0:47:54,34 --> 0:47:55,768
I'll see you Wednesday evening.
 


1002
0:47:55,768 --> 0:47:59,836
And look for an e-mail early
this afternoon about individual


1003
0:47:59,836 --> 0:48:1,63
help tomorrow afternoon.
 


1004
0:48:1,63 --> 0:50:1,63
