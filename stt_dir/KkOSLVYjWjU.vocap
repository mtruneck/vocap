###108 I'll trade me for Malto.
###110 -Myself for Robbie.
###112 
###114 -I trade myself for Malta.
###116 -So that means you're basically trading the whole
###118 team.
###118 -You're putting yourself on Girl.
###118 -Yeah.
###119 -Yeah.
###120 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): I already tried that.
###122 [INAUDIBLE]
###124 -I'd trade Mike for Julien.
###125 MIKE (OFFSCREEN): You can't trade me because I already
###127 traded you.
###128 All right?
###129 ALEX (OFFSCREEN): --same company maybe.

###138 -We'll take Johnzo for Spike.
###142 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Hey, you guys.
###144 
###154 [CHEERS]
###156 
###165 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Yours is a little different

###175 Carol, and they can have Bujnits.

###185 
###188 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Can I ask you a serious question?
###190 -Serious question?
###191 Is this the time or the place for it?
###192 OK, what?
###192 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): If you could trade one skater
###195 from Anti-Hero for a skater from Girl,
###197 who would you trade?
###198 
###202 -All right, let's--
###205 shit.
###206 It's like a chess match.
###207 So you want to take an equally strong piece, if you know
###210 you're going to lose one.
###212 I don't have an answer for that, honestly, dude.
###215 The mixture of people here is like-- there's nothing
###217 interchangeable about anyone.
###219 Sorry, no answer.
###220 -I wouldn't trade anybody, dude.
###223 And if you say I have to, I'll just quit skating.
###227 -OK, wait, fuck that PC answer last time.
###230 We'll go Andy Roy for Sean Sheppi.
###234 Tomorrow.

###256 are all signed up.
###257 Where do we got you, Spike?
###259 Oh, we got your number right here.
###262 Man, we didn't put too much thought into these, so it's
###265 nothing personal if you're offended or something.
###267 -Sweet.
###268 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): There you go.
###268 -[INAUDIBLE] appropriate.
###269 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): All right.
###271 Julian hooked up a race.
###272 Time trials.
###274 -I already ate shit a couple times because
###278 I'm not that good.
###279 I'm in the race, and I think it's going to be a pretty
###283 sorry performance, but I'm psyched.
###285 I'm glad to be included.
###287 [INAUDIBLE] race is about to start.
###289 Julien's announcing.
###290 [INTERPOSING VOICES]
###293 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): One lap to pick up speed, and then

###318 I think it's Heil Hitler, is where the line comes from.
###321 
###327 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): One of my favorite things probably
###329 was being totally surprised when we went to do the time
###333 trials, and we pulled up at the skate park.
###336 Nobody said anything.
###337 We didn't know, and we just got out.
###339 And, well, Julien and whoever else helped him [INAUDIBLE],
###343 thankfully, had all the numbers for all of us to be
###347 pinned on our backs, and we had that little race.
###350 And it felt like we were BMXing or
###352 doing something different.
###353 You know what I mean?
###354 It didn't feel jokey or weird.
###355 It was like, dang, this is really fun.
###357 Why would we not do this?

###400 just started racing.
###402 Seemed like the best use to put it to.
