1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:1,25



2
0:0:1,25 --> 0:0:4,356



3
0:0:4,356 --> 0:0:6,5
JOHN MCAFEE: They are trying to
arrest me for coming into


4
0:0:6,5 --> 0:0:7,26
the country illegally.


5
0:0:7,26 --> 0:0:10,97
We know that this is merely a
move to keep me from doing my


6
0:0:10,97 --> 0:0:12,12
press conference.


7
0:0:12,12 --> 0:0:13,86
-You're not allowed to
leave the hotel.


8
0:0:13,86 --> 0:0:16,103
JOHN MCAFEE: No, dude, if I had
not left that hotel, do


9
0:0:16,103 --> 0:0:18,522
you know what would have
happened tonight?


10
0:0:18,522 --> 0:0:21,642
They would come and get me,
with no one watching, at 2


11
0:0:21,642 --> 0:0:24,27
o'clock in the morning
for something.


12
0:0:24,27 --> 0:0:24,96
Trust me.


13
0:0:24,96 --> 0:0:26,26
-Hey, let me tell
you something.


14
0:0:26,26 --> 0:0:29,76
JOHN MCAFEE: Guatemalan jails
have beds, dude, and food.


15
0:0:29,76 --> 0:0:31,68
It's pretty awesome.


16
0:0:31,68 --> 0:0:33,12
I'm not too concerned.


17
0:0:33,12 --> 0:0:34,37
And you should not be.


18
0:0:34,37 --> 0:0:38,4



19
0:0:38,4 --> 0:0:39,2
Federales.


20
0:0:39,2 --> 0:0:40,95
We don't mess with Federales.


21
0:0:40,95 --> 0:0:41,82
-What's the problem?


22
0:0:41,82 --> 0:0:47,508
JOHN MCAFEE: The problem is
they're trying to detain me.


23
0:0:47,508 --> 0:0:48,8
-For what reason?


24
0:0:48,8 --> 0:0:51,41
JOHN MCAFEE: I think this--
excuse me, sir.


25
0:0:51,41 --> 0:0:51,715
No, no.


26
0:0:51,715 --> 0:0:54,5
This gentleman here
was the one who


27
0:0:54,5 --> 0:0:55,725
detained me, right here.


28
0:0:55,725 --> 0:0:58,834
You should get a picture of
him, and these three guys,


29
0:0:58,834 --> 0:1:0,144
right here.


30
0:1:0,144 --> 0:1:2,108
These three guys, right here.


31
0:1:2,108 --> 0:1:4,72
-For what reason?


32
0:1:4,72 --> 0:1:5,545
JOHN MCAFEE: I'm not sure.


33
0:1:5,545 --> 0:1:8,736
But I was just standing here,
And they were just-- this one


34
0:1:8,736 --> 0:1:12,419
here, this guy came
up to me, here.


35
0:1:12,419 --> 0:1:13,892
May I smoke, sir?


36
0:1:13,892 --> 0:1:16,112
-Yes, you can smoke.


37
0:1:16,112 --> 0:1:19,444
You can definitely smoke.


38
0:1:19,444 --> 0:1:20,8
JOHN MCAFEE: OK.


39
0:1:20,8 --> 0:1:21,32
Make sure you get a
picture of him.


40
0:1:21,32 --> 0:1:21,66
Come here.


41
0:1:21,66 --> 0:1:24,32
-Can we not bring you
into the hotel?


42
0:1:24,32 --> 0:1:25,57
JOHN MCAFEE: What's that?


43
0:1:25,57 --> 0:1:29,2



44
0:1:29,2 --> 0:1:31,45
-So is the arm longer
than you thought?


45
0:1:31,45 --> 0:1:34,2
JOHN MCAFEE: It's
long, isn't it?


46
0:1:34,2 --> 0:1:36,72
It's a long arm, now,
is this not proof?


47
0:1:36,72 --> 0:1:37,97
Is this not proof?


48
0:1:37,97 --> 0:1:47,879



49
0:1:47,879 --> 0:1:48,368
Excuse me, sir.


50
0:1:48,368 --> 0:1:49,835
I'm sorry.


51
0:1:49,835 --> 0:1:51,92
And they could take me back
to police tonight?


52
0:1:51,92 --> 0:1:52,626
-No, never.


53
0:1:52,626 --> 0:1:53,398
JOHN MCAFEE: Are you sure?


54
0:1:53,398 --> 0:1:54,234
Can you promise me, sir?


55
0:1:54,234 --> 0:1:54,652
-I am sure.


56
0:1:54,652 --> 0:1:56,356
JOHN MCAFEE: Because I'm not
worried about anything else.


57
0:1:56,356 --> 0:1:56,852
-Of course.


58
0:1:56,852 --> 0:1:57,844
They won't take you to police.


59
0:1:57,844 --> 0:1:58,34
No, never.


60
0:1:58,34 --> 0:1:59,83
Never.


61
0:1:59,83 --> 0:2:1,3
I will go with you?


62
0:2:1,3 --> 0:2:3,32
I will go with you?


63
0:2:3,32 --> 0:2:6,15
We are going to speak with
the vice minister.


64
0:2:6,15 --> 0:2:7,11
JOHN MCAFEE: Sure.


65
0:2:7,11 --> 0:2:7,59
-OK?


66
0:2:7,59 --> 0:2:8,7
Yeah?


67
0:2:8,7 --> 0:2:8,71
JOHN MCAFEE: You will
come with me.


68
0:2:8,71 --> 0:2:9,51
Is that true?


69
0:2:9,51 --> 0:2:9,99
-He is coming.


70
0:2:9,99 --> 0:2:12,4
Yes, I am going with you.


71
0:2:12,4 --> 0:2:13,89
Just wait a minute.


72
0:2:13,89 --> 0:2:14,1
-John.


73
0:2:14,1 --> 0:2:15,844
-We are waiting for
[INAUDIBLE]


74
0:2:15,844 --> 0:2:16,778
your passport.


75
0:2:16,778 --> 0:2:17,712
And afterwards, we will go.


76
0:2:17,712 --> 0:2:18,962
I told them already.


77
0:2:18,962 --> 0:2:21,385



78
0:2:21,385 --> 0:2:22,635
-You blow from here.


79
0:2:22,635 --> 0:2:25,197



80
0:2:25,197 --> 0:2:28,63
-So I guess I should tell
Jeff not to come?


81
0:2:28,63 --> 0:2:31,98
JOHN MCAFEE: No, tell
Jeff to come.


82
0:2:31,98 --> 0:2:32,348
I think this will be short.


83
0:2:32,348 --> 0:2:55,855



84
0:2:55,855 --> 0:2:57,84
-Where are they taking
you, John?


85
0:2:57,84 --> 0:2:58,26
-Whoa, whoa, whoa.


86
0:2:58,26 --> 0:2:59,94
Wait.


87
0:2:59,94 --> 0:3:2,21
-John, where are you're going?


88
0:3:2,21 --> 0:3:3,622
JOHN MCAFEE: To jail.


89
0:3:3,622 --> 0:3:4,872
-When will you be out?


90
0:3:4,872 --> 0:5:4,872
