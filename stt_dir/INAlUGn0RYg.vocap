###4 SHANE SMITH: Chernobyl, it's empty now.
###7 You know that, right?
###8 Because they had the reaction.
###9 PELLA KAGERMAN: Yeah, I know.
###11 SHANE SMITH: They had a bad reaction to radiation.
###14 So it's totally deserted.
###15 But then all the wolves and the bears came.
###17 So you've got three-eyed wolves and five-legged bears
###21 that are in Chernobyl now.
###22 So we're going to go.
###23 And we're going to hunt them.
###24 PELLA KAGERMAN: But is this serious?
###26 SHANE SMITH: Yeah, it's serious.
###28 MALE SPEAKER: It's the 20th anniversary of the meltdown of
###30 the Chernobyl reactor, which was the biggest nuclear
###32 catastrophe in human history besides
###34 Hiroshima and Nagasaki.
###36 Even now, there's an area the size of Great Britain that's
###38 still radioactive.
###39 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###53 SHANE SMITH: In Italy, or all over the place, in Eastern
###55 Europe, too, they come up to you with little wagons of
###58 panini and birra--
###59 birra, birra, panini, birra, birra, panini, birra--
###63 
###66 they yell out.
###67 And you go, oh, [SPEAKING ITALIAN].
###68 
###71 But here, they don't have that.
###73 
###86 MALE SPEAKER: Where are we going?
###89 MALE SPEAKER: Chernobyl.
###91 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###97 SHANE SMITH: Neutron.
###97 Neutron.
###98 We're in Chernobyl, which was apparently 600 times worse
###105 than Hiroshima.
###106 The only guys that survived here were the firemen, because
###111 they were bombed when they were putting out the fires.
###114 It's the same as the doctors in Hiroshima.
###117 They lived because they got drunk.
###120 So we've been drinking, haven't we, Pella?
###121 PELLA KAGERMAN: Yes.
###122 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###130 SHANE SMITH: There's a lot of people living here.
###134 There's a whole city here.
###136 Look.
###137 That's not good.
###139 YURI TATARCHUCK: Some people work here,
###140 some people live here.
###141 SHANE SMITH: But isn't it dangerous to live here?
###143 YURI TATARCHUCK: Actually, this territory was evacuated
###144 in 1986, after the accident.
###147 But in the period of time from 1986 to 1988, more than 1,500
###152 people came back here.
###154 
###156 After the explosion of 1986, April 26, on the reactor unit
###160 number 4, it was made decision to evacuate.
###163 April 27 was the date of the evacuation of Pripyat town.
###167 And later in the week, it was evacuated
###169 neighborhood villages.
###170 And afterwards, it was established Chernobyl
###172 exclusion zone.
###173 Average level of radiation in Chernobyl nowadays is 35 micro
###177 roentgens per hour.
###178 And the natural background we consider from 12 to 20.
###182 SHANE SMITH: So it's double.
###183 YURI TATARCHUCK: It's double, yes.
###184 SHANE SMITH: What's going on here, now?
###185 YURI TATARCHUCK: They hunted some animals just to
###188 investigate what's going on, what processes are going on,
###191 what kind of mutation or changes
###193 are possible in nature.
###194 SHANE SMITH: Were there a lot of mutant animals?
###195 YURI TATARCHUCK: It was very clear that some species are
###198 very contaminated.
###199 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###206 SHANE SMITH: Apparently, I have radiophobia.
###208 Radiophobia is when you come to Chernobyl, people think
###212 that they get a sore throat, or their eyes water, or they
###215 have diarrhea.
###216 And it's not because of the actual radiation is infecting
###218 you with cancer.
###219 But it's because you think you're afraid.
###221 It's all psychosomatic.
###223 
###225 This is [INAUDIBLE].
###228 This is going to help us live.
###229 
###234 So that used to be a whole village.
###237 And they buried the village.
###238 YURI TATARCHUCK: Right.
###239 The big elements of the houses were buried there on the side
###242 of the hill.
###244 MALE SPEAKER: Oh, it's going bananas, dude.
###247 We're at 400.
###248 SHANE SMITH: We're at 400?
###252 This is the reactor that blew up.
###253 MALE SPEAKER: So that's all concrete, right?
###255 YURI TATARCHUCK: No.
###256 The northern wall, for example, is concrete.
###260 And as for the western wall, it's made of metal.
###265 And the roof, also metal.
###266 SHANE SMITH: What happened?
###267 Why did it blow up?
###268 What went on?
###269 YURI TATARCHUCK: First of all, it was the
###270 construction of reactor.
###272 SHANE SMITH: It was the Russians, those bastards.
###274 YURI TATARCHUCK: It was Soviet.
###275 SHANE SMITH: Soviet bastards.
###276 YURI TATARCHUCK: It wasn't Russian or Ukrainian.
###278 Was Soviet!
###279 SHANE SMITH: They blew us up.
###280 YURI TATARCHUCK: [INAUDIBLE].
###282 SHANE SMITH: Holy shit.
###283 YURI TATARCHUCK: Environment [INAUDIBLE].
###284 
###290 SHANE SMITH: This is the radioactive town of Pripyat.
###293 And apparently, there's wolves and bears living in these
###295 buildings now.
###297 And they're not mutated.
###299 They're changed.
###300 There's no mutations.
###301 They're changes.
###302 
###312 YURI TATARCHUCK: Look, we can see the civil defense.
###315 These procedures were never used.
###317 SHANE SMITH: So if there was a meltdown or a war, you'd just
###320 put a mask on and--
###321 YURI TATARCHUCK: And you escape to the shelters.
###323 SHANE SMITH: Are there shelters here?
###324 YURI TATARCHUCK: A shelter is any kind of a basement.
###327 
###333 SHANE SMITH: As you can see, not so different from us.
###337 They liked to play some basketball, some volleyball,
###340 maybe a bit of track.
###343 This is in high school.
###345 How to kill a tank, how to attack,
###348 how to throw a grenade--
###350 oh, that's amazing.
###351 How to spot what different kind of plane,
###354 F-111, B-52, F-14.
###356 Nuclear energy is the future, then.
###358 YURI TATARCHUCK: I think yes.
###359 SHANE SMITH: If this is the future, then we're fucked.
###363 
###372 YURI TATARCHUCK: This amusement park was planned to
###374 open on the first of May, 1986.
###376 So it was never opened.
###379 SHANE SMITH: This is what happens when we play with
###381 technology we don't understand.
###382 YURI TATARCHUCK: Now here we measure, and it shows
###385 average 100, 150.
###387 SHANE SMITH: Why so much?
###388 175--
###389 YURI TATARCHUCK: It's not too much.
###390 Look.
###391 
###393 SHANE SMITH: 200.
###395 YURI TATARCHUCK: On the soil, under the snow,
###397 there is the most.
###398 SHANE SMITH: Why here so much?
###399 YURI TATARCHUCK: It's mostly under the snow.
###401 Mostly, it's absorbing all this dust and this radiation.
###404 SHANE SMITH: It's at fucking 600, dude.
###406 YURI TATARCHUCK: More than 600.
###408 Without snow, it's 1,500.
###410 SHANE SMITH: Really?
###411 Did you see that fucking thing there, dude?
###413 The thing went up to 800.
###416 800 is bad.
###418 800 is very bad.
###419 MALE SPEAKER: 1,283, 1,273, 1,284, [INAUDIBLE], 1,294,
###423 1,300, 1,300, 1,297, 1,300, 1,300, 1,275.
###427 SHANE SMITH: We bribed our guide to get
###429 some machine guns.
###431 And we're going to hunt the radioactive wild boars.
###433 Now, what we have to do is be very quiet.
###436 We're in a deserted building.
###438 And we have to wait a little bit.
###439 And when we see the wild boars-- there's hundreds of
###441 them with big fucking toothed fangy things.
###444 And when we see them, we're going to shoot them with
###446 machine guns.
###447 [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING]
###455 SHANE SMITH: So after we shot at the boars, they ran into
###458 the forest.
###459 And me and Pella go running after them.
###460 And they're like, no, no, no, no.
###462 If you go in there-- it's called the red forest.
###464 It's the most radioactive place on earth.
###467 And if you go in there, you're going to die.
###469 You really feel like this is the apocalypse here.
###471 There's no fear of death because everything is dead.
###475 The ground will kill you.
###477 The water will kill you.
###478 The trees will kill you.
###480 My shoes are radioactive right now.
###482 The beasts are fucking-- they show no fear
###483 because they're mutants.
###486 Everything's been destroyed.
###487 Everything's been killed, abandoned.
###491 It's some heavy, heavy fucking shit here, dude.
###494 It's going to be OK.
###497 It's going to be OK.
###499 PELLA KAGERMAN: It was a bit too much?
###500 SHANE SMITH: It's going to be OK.
###502 I gotta throw these shoes away.
###504 I think they're radioactive.
