CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome to CNN STUDENT
NEWS. I`m Carl Azuz. It`s Thursday, but the


2
0:0:17,64 --> 0:0:22,5
political world is still buzzing about President
Obama`s State of the Union address. These


3
0:0:22,5 --> 0:0:27,39
speeches can give an idea of what issues a
president wants to focus on. Tuesday night,


4
0:0:27,39 --> 0:0:31,509
he talked a lot about the economy, specifically
creating job for the American middle class.


5
0:0:31,509 --> 0:0:37,26
It`s something that Senator Marco Rubio discussed
in the Republican response, too. Why is there


6
0:0:37,26 --> 0:0:40,23
so much attention on this?


7
0:0:40,23 --> 0:0:46,59
In 2009, when he took the oath for the first
time, about 133 million Americans were employed,


8
0:0:46,59 --> 0:0:50,55
and that number was already dropping dramatically
as we came out of the Bush years, and it kept


9
0:0:50,55 --> 0:0:57,579
dropping until February of 2010 when it hit
its lowest point. Then we began this long


10
0:0:57,579 --> 0:1:6,13
slow grind backup to where we are today. Right
now we have 1.2 million more jobs than we


11
0:1:6,13 --> 0:1:10,289
did when President Obama first took office.
That`s not nearly as robust as people would


12
0:1:10,289 --> 0:1:16,66
like to see. But more importantly, think about
this: the jobs we lost over here simply weren`t


13
0:1:16,66 --> 0:1:20,61
as good as the jobs we gained back over here.
I`m going to explain what I`m talking about.


14
0:1:20,61 --> 0:1:24,329
Rutgers University did a study where they
talked to a lot of people who`d lost jobs


15
0:1:24,329 --> 0:1:29,86
and then regained other jobs. They found that
22 percent of those people said the jobs that


16
0:1:29,86 --> 0:1:35,259
they have now pay about the same as the job
they lost before. Beyond that, another 24


17
0:1:35,259 --> 0:1:39,84
percent said, they`re being paid more than
they were before, but now look at this number:


18
0:1:39,84 --> 0:1:46,25
because it`s the big one: more than half the
people say, their new job pays less than their


19
0:1:46,25 --> 0:1:50,689
old job. These are the people who really are
struggling out there. They are working as


20
0:1:50,689 --> 0:1:56,52
hard as they can and they just cannot move
ahead in any way, shape or form.


21
0:1:56,52 --> 0:2:0,939
Next story today: remember that massive blizzard
that hit the north- eastern U.S. last weekend?


22
0:2:0,939 --> 0:2:5,939
Look at this video from Connecticut and watch
how much snow is building up around this clock


23
0:2:5,939 --> 0:2:12,44
post. This is just one night. Some parts of
the state got up to three feet of snow. In


24
0:2:12,44 --> 0:2:16,72
the city of Waterbury, all of the schools
have been closed since the blizzard hit. You


25
0:2:16,72 --> 0:2:21,5
might think that sounds all right, but when
the city asked for help shoveling the snow,


26
0:2:21,5 --> 0:2:23,91
a lot of the students showed up to pitch in.


27
0:2:23,91 --> 0:2:24,92
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


28
0:2:24,92 --> 0:2:28,43
FRANCHESA VILLAR, STUDENT: Because this is
our community, everybody needs to help out,


29
0:2:28,43 --> 0:2:29,55
and we`re all a family.


30
0:2:29,55 --> 0:2:32,28
MAYOR NEIL O`LEARY, WATERBURY, CONNECTICUT:
You`ve got teachers here, you`ve got adults


31
0:2:32,28 --> 0:2:36,58
here, as you can see. You`ve got a bunch of
students here. So, you know, this is, you


32
0:2:36,58 --> 0:2:38,36
know - I`m amazed at the turnout, to be honest
with you.


33
0:2:38,36 --> 0:2:41,5
ARIANNA MCDONALD, STUDENT: Like if you had
been staying in the house for like four days


34
0:2:41,5 --> 0:2:44,67
straight without school, so we just wanted
to come help, especially elementary schools.


35
0:2:44,67 --> 0:2:45,629
(END VIDEO CLIP)

0:2:45,629 --> 0:2:46,59

37
0:2:46,59 --> 0:2:50,739
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today`s "Shoutout" goes
out to Ms. Krueger`s world geography class


38
0:2:50,739 --> 0:2:56,37
at Orr Middle class in Las Vegas, Nevada.
What religious observance marks the start


39
0:2:56,37 --> 0:3:2,959
of Lent? You know what to do. Is it Palm Sunday,
Shrove Tuesday, Ash Wednesday or Good Friday?


40
0:3:2,959 --> 0:3:9,8
You`ve got three seconds, go!


41
0:3:9,8 --> 0:3:16,98
Lent starts on Ash Wednesday, and ends six
and a half weeks later on Easter. That`s your


42
0:3:16,98 --> 0:3:19,98
answer and that`s your "Shoutout."


43
0:3:19,98 --> 0:3:21,78
(END VIDEO CLIP)


44
0:3:21,78 --> 0:3:26,4
AZUZ: Those six and a half weeks start this
week. Yesterday, it was Ash Wednesday, religious


45
0:3:26,4 --> 0:3:30,799
ceremonies around the world marked the observance.
In Vatican City, the home of the Roman Catholic


46
0:3:30,799 --> 0:3:36,879
Church, Pope Benedict XVI led an Ash Wednesday
mass. This is the last one he`ll lead as pope.


47
0:3:36,879 --> 0:3:41,239
On Monday, he announced his resigning at the
end of this month. So with Ash Wednesday,


48
0:3:41,239 --> 0:3:44,519
Lent has officially started, here`s a look
at what that`s all about.


49
0:3:44,519 --> 0:3:44,92
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


50
0:3:44,92 --> 0:3:51,19
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: For Christians, Lent is
a season of prayer, of paying penance for


51
0:3:51,19 --> 0:3:57,9
sins and for sacrifice. That`s the one act
we all associate with Lent, giving something


52
0:3:57,9 --> 0:4:1,54
up.


53
0:4:1,54 --> 0:4:8,69
Lent is for Christians, the period leading
up to Easter. The period lasts for 40 days


54
0:4:8,69 --> 0:4:13,45
and corresponds to the 40 days that Jesus
is said to have fasted in the desert before


55
0:4:13,45 --> 0:4:18,13
beginning his life of ministry.


56
0:4:18,13 --> 0:4:23,4
Most of us associate Lent with Catholicism,
but the truth is, there are many different


57
0:4:23,4 --> 0:4:30,52
kinds of Christians that celebrate Lent. Eastern
Orthodox Christians, various mainline Protestant


58
0:4:30,52 --> 0:4:36,99
denominations, Presbyterians and Methodists,
among them. And in recent years, we`ve seen


59
0:4:36,99 --> 0:4:41,51
a trend toward Evangelical churches, which
have traditionally avoided Lent, expressing


60
0:4:41,51 --> 0:4:46,919
interest in it and beginning to celebrate
it or observe it in some fashion.


61
0:4:46,919 --> 0:4:52,779
Some give up chocolate. In recent years, there
have been Christians that have given up Facebook,


62
0:4:52,779 --> 0:4:57,279
or social networking for 40 straight days,
which is, you know, impossible for some of


63
0:4:57,279 --> 0:5:3,1
us to imagine. It really varies widely what
people choose to give up for Lent.


64
0:5:3,1 --> 0:5:6,3
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I`m planning on giving
up any kind of sweets, chocolate, cake, gummies.


65
0:5:6,3 --> 0:5:9,44
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: For a Lent, I`m going
to be giving up meat.


66
0:5:9,44 --> 0:5:12,95
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I`m going to give up fat
food. Fat burgers, in particular.


67
0:5:12,95 --> 0:5:17,5
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I really want to try
to be a healthier person. I want to start


68
0:5:17,5 --> 0:5:18,149
working out and eating right.


69
0:5:18,149 --> 0:5:21,43
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: There`s always some time
during Lent that you think about you wish


70
0:5:21,43 --> 0:5:25,729
you didn`t give it up. But when you get to
the end you always feel good about it.


71
0:5:25,729 --> 0:5:26,55
(END VIDEO CLIP)


72
0:5:26,55 --> 0:5:30,339
AZUZ: So, what would you give up? Whether
or not you observe Lent, what`s something


73
0:5:30,339 --> 0:5:35,1
you enjoy that you`d try giving up for 40
days? Vegetables don`t count. Check out our

0:5:36,909 --> 0:5:38,77
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


76
0:5:38,77 --> 0:5:43,839
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Is this legit? The word
"valentine" comes from the Latin word for


77
0:5:43,839 --> 0:5:45,219
heart.


78
0:5:45,219 --> 0:5:52,169
Nope. It comes from St. Valentine, the patron
saint of love.


79
0:5:52,169 --> 0:5:55,2
(END VIDEO CLIP)


80
0:5:55,2 --> 0:6:1,469
AZUZ: You don`t need to live in Lovejoy, Georgia,
Romance, Arkansas or Valentine, Texas to feel


81
0:6:1,469 --> 0:6:7,219
the love this Valentine`s Day. 62 percent
of adults say they celebrate it. And let me


82
0:6:7,219 --> 0:6:13,289
count the ways how. Many people buy stuff,
candy stuff, gifty stuff, cards, jewelry,


83
0:6:13,289 --> 0:6:18,959
flowers. Those little hearts that say "I do."
The average person will likely drop $130 bucks


84
0:6:18,959 --> 0:6:24,779
on Valentine`s Day and men are the bigger
spenders. They`ll shell out between $150 and


85
0:6:24,779 --> 0:6:31,529
$175, about twice what women will spend. Many
of those who procrastinate might find themselves


86
0:6:31,529 --> 0:6:36,8
in flower shops. The application FourSquare
(ph) says they are the most popular spot for


87
0:6:36,8 --> 0:6:42,8
last minute Valentine shoppers, and afterward,
likely a French restaurant or a cupcake shop.


88
0:6:42,8 --> 0:6:49,29
Two popular places to celebrate love. Of course,
here is another way: sustained smooching,


89
0:6:49,29 --> 0:6:52,95
liplocked lovers in Thailand are going for
the Guinness world record. It`s currently


90
0:6:52,95 --> 0:6:59,7
set at 50 hours and 25 minutes. Yes, two people
actually kiss that long. Will their romantic


91
0:6:59,7 --> 0:7:5,709
record be broken up? Until we know for sure,
our lips are sealed.


92
0:7:5,709 --> 0:7:9,93
Finally today, we`re going from smooches to
pooches. And one in particular, that`s getting


93
0:7:9,93 --> 0:7:14,33
a lot of love. His name is Banana Joe, he
is the top dog at this year`s Westminster


94
0:7:14,33 --> 0:7:20,349
Kennel Club Dog Show. Joe is an affenpinscher.
That means monkey terrier in German. He is


95
0:7:20,349 --> 0:7:25,159
the first of his breed to take home top honors.
At Westminster, winning the title is hard


96
0:7:25,159 --> 0:7:29,719
enough, but when good dogs face off against
bad hair, that`s when the fir really flies.


97
0:7:29,719 --> 0:7:30,219
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


98
0:7:30,219 --> 0:7:34,18
JEANNE MOOS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Who hasn`t
had an important occasion when you want to


99
0:7:34,18 --> 0:7:39,52
look your very best, and then you venture
outside, only to discover it`s a dreaded bad


100
0:7:39,52 --> 0:7:40,37
hair day.


101
0:7:40,37 --> 0:7:45,2
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Oh, it is. It was. We
had to buy an umbrella and a poncho outside


102
0:7:45,2 --> 0:7:45,649
of the hotel to get him here.


103
0:7:45,649 --> 0:7:48,8
MOOS (on camera): You put the poncho on him
or on you?


104
0:7:48,8 --> 0:7:48,55
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Him.


105
0:7:48,55 --> 0:7:53,2
MOOS (voice over): Day one of the Westminster
Kennel Club Dog Show in New York was rainy,


106
0:7:53,2 --> 0:7:57,39
foggy, slushy, enough to curl even a showdog`s
hair.


107
0:7:57,39 --> 0:8:1,599
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: They can curl, they can
go frizzy on you, just like, you ladies, they


108
0:8:1,599 --> 0:8:2,39
can have a bad hair day.


109
0:8:2,39 --> 0:8:5,93
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: And his hair going, and
soaking this up.


110
0:8:5,93 --> 0:8:10,959
MOOS: Rain left this long haired dachshund
with ridges. They blow- dried him, then used


111
0:8:10,959 --> 0:8:13,43
a special comb to try and smooth him out.


112
0:8:13,43 --> 0:8:16,11
(on camera): Whose hair got it worse? His
or yours?


113
0:8:16,11 --> 0:8:17,11
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Mine doesn`t count.


114
0:8:17,11 --> 0:8:20,81
MOOS (voice over): Sure, there are worse things
that could happen than getting rained on.


115
0:8:20,81 --> 0:8:26,839
You dog carrier could crash. But rainy weather
is a big deal to a dog with dreadlocks.


116
0:8:26,839 --> 0:8:29,19
(on camera): So they are naturally occurring
dreadlocks?


117
0:8:29,19 --> 0:8:29,669
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes.


118
0:8:29,669 --> 0:8:31,279
MOOS (voice over): Or a bearded collie?


119
0:8:31,279 --> 0:8:34,2
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If you look good coming
out of the shower, then come out of the shower,


120
0:8:34,2 --> 0:8:35,0
but if you don`t ...


121
0:8:35,0 --> 0:8:35,399
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Then ...


122
0:8:35,399 --> 0:8:36,37
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Then dry your hair.


123
0:8:36,37 --> 0:8:40,32
MOOS: Danny, the cavalier King Charles spaniel,
required flat ironing.


124
0:8:40,32 --> 0:8:41,849
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Everything wants to go
the wrong direction.


125
0:8:41,849 --> 0:8:44,79
MOOS (on camera): I just came from makeup
and they just did that to me.


126
0:8:44,79 --> 0:8:50,68
(voice over): But if rain makes for a bad
dog hair day, this looks counterintuitive.


127
0:8:50,68 --> 0:8:51,92
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yeah!


128
0:8:51,92 --> 0:8:54,81
MOOS (on camera): What is this thing?


129
0:8:54,81 --> 0:8:57,15
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It`s actually a fog machine,
but it gets him soaking wet, sorry.


130
0:8:57,15 --> 0:9:3,11
MOOS (voice over): First, she soaked Beowulf,
then she blow dried and fluffed him, to give


131
0:9:3,11 --> 0:9:6,53
him more volume. And then there are dogs like
Violet (ph).


132
0:9:6,53 --> 0:9:8,16
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: A curl and then the tail--


133
0:9:8,16 --> 0:9:8,84
MOOS (on camera): The rain didn`t do this?


134
0:9:8,84 --> 0:9:9,9
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: No.


135
0:9:9,9 --> 0:9:10,91
MOOS (voice over): Violet never left the indoors.


136
0:9:10,91 --> 0:9:13,12
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: She`s having a good hair
day.


137
0:9:13,12 --> 0:9:17,76
MOOS: When it`s a bad dog hair day, you can
always get rid of the bad hair.


138
0:9:17,76 --> 0:9:19,12
(on camera): Can I have this?


139
0:9:19,12 --> 0:9:20,19
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Yes, you may.
