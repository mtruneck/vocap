1
0:0:4,5 --> 0:0:6,219
What would happen
if I walked out that door right now,


2
0:0:6,219 --> 0:0:9,498
and never came back?


3
0:0:9,498 --> 0:0:12,177
You need to start
behaving like an adult


4
0:0:12,177 --> 0:0:14,419
instead of behaving like a child.


5
0:0:14,419 --> 0:0:20,738
Maybe you need to start
behaving like my mum.


6
0:0:20,738 --> 0:0:24,18
Can you remember anything
from last night?


7
0:0:24,18 --> 0:0:30,458
Finn?


8
0:0:30,458 --> 0:0:32,498
What the fuck? Karim?


9
0:0:32,498 --> 0:0:35,779
'Look, it's about Tix.
She collapsed this morning.'


10
0:0:35,779 --> 0:0:53,578
Is it serious?


11
0:0:53,578 --> 0:0:56,377
'She went into
cardiac arrest during the night.


12
0:0:56,377 --> 0:1:0,57
'The doctors there
managed to revive her but she...'


13
0:1:0,57 --> 0:1:1,136
What?


14
0:1:1,136 --> 0:1:3,521
She... She's very, very weak


15
0:1:3,521 --> 0:1:9,69
so they don't know
if she'll come round.


16
0:1:9,69 --> 0:1:11,429
What about you, Rae?


17
0:1:11,429 --> 0:1:12,87
You and Tix are really close.


18
0:1:12,87 --> 0:1:17,229
Kester says you're thinking about
stopping his sessions.


19
0:1:17,229 --> 0:1:20,29
Have you got people there for you?


20
0:1:20,29 --> 0:1:54,829
I've got loads of people
I can talk to.


21
0:1:54,829 --> 0:2:39,909
Oh, Tix!


22
0:2:39,909 --> 0:2:45,229
'Dear Diary, I've been to a place
this dark once before.


23
0:2:45,229 --> 0:2:48,29
'Nearly made the biggest mistake.


24
0:2:48,29 --> 0:2:51,669
'I couldn't risk
going back that low again.


25
0:2:51,669 --> 0:2:55,69
'I needed to talk to someone.


26
0:2:55,69 --> 0:2:58,87
'I didn't deserve to be happy.
Not after what I did to Tix.


27
0:2:58,87 --> 0:3:7,829
'Never mind that
I'm fat, loud and annoying!


28
0:3:7,829 --> 0:3:10,588
'Maybe Finn and Chloe
weren't lost to me.


29
0:3:10,588 --> 0:3:12,95
'Maybe they weren't even going out.


30
0:3:12,95 --> 0:3:15,589
'Maybe it was just a kiss.


31
0:3:15,589 --> 0:3:18,668
'Either way, I had to face them
sooner or later.'


32
0:3:18,668 --> 0:3:21,59
My God, what an effin' night!
My head's bangin'!


33
0:3:21,59 --> 0:3:23,69
Are you all right?


34
0:3:23,69 --> 0:3:23,789
Brilliant.


35
0:3:23,789 --> 0:3:25,95
Where the bloody hell
did you get to?


36
0:3:25,95 --> 0:3:27,476
Dunno.


37
0:3:27,476 --> 0:3:29,235
Woke up in a bloody field.


38
0:3:29,235 --> 0:3:31,755
And then, thank God, I saw Chop
in his car.


39
0:3:31,755 --> 0:3:33,317
Have you spoke to Izzy?


40
0:3:33,317 --> 0:3:34,636
No.


41
0:3:34,636 --> 0:3:35,844
No-one knows where she is.


42
0:3:35,844 --> 0:3:36,686
She'll be fine.


43
0:3:36,686 --> 0:3:39,365
What if she went back with him?


44
0:3:39,365 --> 0:3:41,124
And what if she went back with him?


45
0:3:41,124 --> 0:3:43,206
She's single, isn't she?
It's her decision.


46
0:3:43,206 --> 0:3:44,765
Eurgh. Oh, my god.


47
0:3:44,765 --> 0:3:46,404
Whose idea was it to meet for food?


48
0:3:46,404 --> 0:3:48,724
It was my idea.
This is supposed to be


49
0:3:48,724 --> 0:3:50,924
the debrief.
The best part about the night out


50
0:3:50,924 --> 0:3:52,566
is the debrief in the morning.


51
0:3:52,566 --> 0:3:54,285
Well, fuck the debrief.


52
0:3:54,285 --> 0:3:57,404
I can't eat when it feels like
someone's taken a piss on my soul.


53
0:3:57,404 --> 0:3:58,4
I'm gonna...


54
0:3:58,4 --> 0:4:1,284
Hang on! One minute. What?
What about the debrief?


55
0:4:1,284 --> 0:4:3,924
Archie's right, mate.
I don't need a debrief.


56
0:4:3,924 --> 0:4:6,886
I need a shower
and a shit-load of peppermint tea.


57
0:4:6,886 --> 0:4:8,445
I'll see yous later.


58
0:4:8,445 --> 0:4:9,645
See ya.


59
0:4:9,645 --> 0:4:20,605
Oh...


60
0:4:20,605 --> 0:4:22,365
I'm going to, um...


61
0:4:22,365 --> 0:4:33,205
going to the toilet.


62
0:4:33,205 --> 0:4:35,885
Oh, my God, Rae. I kissed him!


63
0:4:35,885 --> 0:4:38,285
- Who?
- Finn!


64
0:4:38,285 --> 0:4:41,244
You know I didn't really like him
that much


65
0:4:41,244 --> 0:4:44,406
although I just fancied him
cos he was so fit.


66
0:4:44,406 --> 0:4:46,405
And now I really do like him.


67
0:4:46,405 --> 0:4:52,885
Oh, it's so nice when that happens.


68
0:4:52,885 --> 0:4:58,165
Get off me!


69
0:4:58,165 --> 0:5:0,125
- Rae?
- What?


70
0:5:0,125 --> 0:5:3,364
Well, me and Finn
haven't spoken about it yet but


71
0:5:3,364 --> 0:5:5,406
we'll deffo be going out
by the end of next week.


72
0:5:5,406 --> 0:5:9,645
And then, well, you know...


73
0:5:9,645 --> 0:5:11,525
Rae, I'm talking about...


74
0:5:11,525 --> 0:5:14,285
Sex. Yeah. I get it.


75
0:5:14,285 --> 0:5:16,206
It's a really exciting time for you.


76
0:5:16,206 --> 0:5:21,685
Yeah, it is.


77
0:5:21,685 --> 0:5:33,485
Ooh...


78
0:5:33,485 --> 0:5:47,605
I'm just going to go.


79
0:5:47,605 --> 0:5:48,645
Mum?


80
0:5:48,645 --> 0:5:52,685
I'm just putting
my wedding face on.


81
0:5:52,685 --> 0:5:54,326
Oh, I look like a dog's dinner.


82
0:5:54,326 --> 0:5:56,725
You don't, Mum.


83
0:5:56,725 --> 0:6:0,45
You look lovely.


84
0:6:0,45 --> 0:6:1,125
How's Tix?


85
0:6:1,125 --> 0:6:4,525
Not good.


86
0:6:4,525 --> 0:6:6,965
Rae, I'm glad you've come home.


87
0:6:6,965 --> 0:6:8,445
I'm sorry.


88
0:6:8,445 --> 0:6:16,485
It's fine. We're fine.


89
0:6:16,485 --> 0:6:17,805
Mum?


90
0:6:17,805 --> 0:6:18,805
Mm?


91
0:6:18,805 --> 0:6:22,325
I need to talk to you
about something.


92
0:6:22,325 --> 0:6:26,125
Well, go on then, spit it out.


93
0:6:26,125 --> 0:6:30,525
I saw something weird this morning.


94
0:6:30,525 --> 0:6:32,725
I saw Karim...


95
0:6:32,725 --> 0:6:35,125
Saw what?


96
0:6:35,125 --> 0:6:38,485
Well, he was with someone.


97
0:6:38,485 --> 0:6:42,485
A woman.


98
0:6:42,485 --> 0:6:43,885
What woman?


99
0:6:43,885 --> 0:6:46,725
I don't know.


100
0:6:46,725 --> 0:6:58,325
He kissed her.


101
0:6:58,325 --> 0:6:59,965
Look out the window.


102
0:6:59,965 --> 0:7:4,565
Hamal, let's go.


103
0:7:4,565 --> 0:7:9,725
Yeah, I see.


104
0:7:9,725 --> 0:7:12,885
Everyone's got family, Rae.


105
0:7:12,885 --> 0:7:15,925
His sister.


106
0:7:15,925 --> 0:7:18,485
Why do you hate him so much, Rae?


107
0:7:18,485 --> 0:7:21,245
I don't hate him. I don't know him.


108
0:7:21,245 --> 0:7:23,966
Well, why have you never bothered to
get to know him?


109
0:7:23,966 --> 0:7:27,765
Rae?


110
0:7:27,765 --> 0:7:32,5
Look, I know he's never gonna be
your proper dad.


111
0:7:32,5 --> 0:7:33,525
He's a good man


112
0:7:33,525 --> 0:7:38,925
and he is a part of this family and
you need to start accepting that.


113
0:7:38,925 --> 0:7:40,806
I can't force you to be
part of this family.


114
0:7:40,806 --> 0:7:46,805
It's you who needs to decide
whether you want to or not.


115
0:7:46,805 --> 0:7:50,925
Who is my proper dad?


116
0:7:50,925 --> 0:7:53,445
What do you mean?


117
0:7:53,445 --> 0:8:2,965
I know it was you
who's been writing the letters.


118
0:8:2,965 --> 0:8:5,685
I just wanna know who he is.


119
0:8:5,685 --> 0:8:8,725
Is his name even Victor?


120
0:8:8,725 --> 0:8:11,165
Yeah, his name's Victor.


121
0:8:11,165 --> 0:8:14,5
Well, were there any real letters?


122
0:8:14,5 --> 0:8:19,125
Has he ever tried to get in touch?


123
0:8:19,125 --> 0:8:20,405
Um...


124
0:8:20,405 --> 0:8:23,645
Well, does he not know where we live?


125
0:8:23,645 --> 0:8:24,805
Yeah.


126
0:8:24,805 --> 0:8:26,606
What? He knows or he doesn't know?


127
0:8:26,606 --> 0:8:31,5
He knows.


128
0:8:31,5 --> 0:8:33,846
I started writing those letters
when you were six, Rae.


129
0:8:33,846 --> 0:8:36,205
I know it was a stupid thing to do


130
0:8:36,205 --> 0:8:38,926
but I don't know, I guess I thought
that he might be coming back.


131
0:8:38,926 --> 0:8:40,965
But once I started, well...


132
0:8:40,965 --> 0:8:43,285
well, I didn't know how to stop.


133
0:8:43,285 --> 0:8:45,365
But once I stared, well...


134
0:8:45,365 --> 0:8:47,446
well, I didn't know how to stop.


135
0:8:47,446 --> 0:8:54,5
I didn't know to stop.
I didn't know how to stop.


136
0:8:54,5 --> 0:8:58,885
It's fine.
I mean, we'll talk about it later.


137
0:8:58,885 --> 0:9:14,485
You've got enough to do.


138
0:9:14,485 --> 0:9:18,365
Here he is.


139
0:9:18,365 --> 0:9:34,605
Are you all right? Nice to see you.


140
0:9:34,605 --> 0:9:38,485
'So what if my mum
was starting a new life?


141
0:9:38,485 --> 0:9:41,685
'So what if Chloe and Finn
were lost to me?


142
0:9:41,685 --> 0:9:45,126
'No matter what happened,
I'd always have the rest of the gang.


143
0:9:45,126 --> 0:10:10,445
'And I'd always have my diary.'


144
0:10:10,445 --> 0:10:14,404
Excuse me, I left a little blue bag
in here when I was here this morning.


145
0:10:14,404 --> 0:10:18,204
- Denim bag?
- Yeah. Um, well, can I have it
back, please? It's got, like,


146
0:10:18,204 --> 0:10:19,924
really important documents in it.


147
0:10:19,924 --> 0:10:22,86
I gave it to one of your friends
as they left.


148
0:10:22,86 --> 0:10:35,655
- Which friend?
- A pretty girl.


149
0:10:35,655 --> 0:10:38,346
'I can't believe Chloe
would say that.


150
0:10:38,346 --> 0:10:40,546
'Sometimes I think
she's being a bitch on purpose.


151
0:10:40,546 --> 0:10:42,148
'Sometimes... I love Finn.


152
0:10:42,148 --> 0:10:44,227
'I love Finn!


153
0:10:44,227 --> 0:10:46,363
'I think I'd even snog his armpits.


154
0:10:46,363 --> 0:10:47,723
'I'd love to snog his armpit!


155
0:10:47,723 --> 0:10:50,723
'But Chloe doesn't bloody realise
not everyone is rich.


156
0:10:50,723 --> 0:10:59,604
'Not everyone is rich.
If Archie wasn't gay...'


157
0:10:59,604 --> 0:11:3,124
Chloe!


158
0:11:3,124 --> 0:11:5,603
Oh, Chloe, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean it!


159
0:11:5,603 --> 0:11:9,85
I just write whatever comes into my
head. Chloe, please, I'm sorry.


160
0:11:9,85 --> 0:11:10,764
Stay away from me.


161
0:11:10,764 --> 0:12:35,164
Right? And stay away from Finn.


162
0:12:35,164 --> 0:12:43,765
'I've been to a place
this dark once before.'


163
0:12:43,765 --> 0:12:46,684
'Nearly made the biggest mistake.


164
0:12:46,684 --> 0:12:52,164
'But what was the mistake?


165
0:12:52,164 --> 0:12:55,524
'Ever cutting myself in the first
place?


166
0:12:55,524 --> 0:13:3,284
'Or not cutting deep enough?'


167
0:13:3,284 --> 0:13:6,644
'Dear Mum...'


168
0:13:6,644 --> 0:13:12,684
'I am so sorry.'


169
0:13:12,684 --> 0:13:16,884
'I'm so sorry that
I fucked everything up.'


170
0:13:16,884 --> 0:13:22,244
'It's not your fault.'


171
0:13:22,244 --> 0:13:23,964
'I'm not hungry.


172
0:13:23,964 --> 0:13:28,4
'For the first time in months,
I don't care about food.


173
0:13:28,4 --> 0:13:30,643
'I don't care about filling the gap
by eating,


174
0:13:30,643 --> 0:13:32,325
'or by hurting myself a little.


175
0:13:32,325 --> 0:13:34,964
'The gap's too wide now.


176
0:13:34,964 --> 0:13:38,764
'I tried so hard to be someone
everybody could like.


177
0:13:38,764 --> 0:13:40,683
'But no matter how hard I try,


178
0:13:40,683 --> 0:13:44,325
'I'll always be the same,
ridiculous, pointless blob.


179
0:13:44,325 --> 0:13:46,244
'I'll always hurt people.


180
0:13:46,244 --> 0:13:50,3
'And I'll always let people down.'


181
0:13:50,3 --> 0:13:55,843
'I'm so sorry, Mum.'


182
0:13:55,843 --> 0:14:0,84
'I just hate myself so much more
than I could ever love anything.


183
0:14:0,84 --> 0:14:3,964
'And I guess I did
achieve one thing.


184
0:14:3,964 --> 0:14:57,164
'I wrote the most boring suicide
note in the history of the world.'


185
0:14:57,164 --> 0:14:59,804
Hiya! Tix?


186
0:14:59,804 --> 0:15:2,364
What's going on? Are you all right?


187
0:15:2,364 --> 0:15:6,804
You're in hospital.
You're in a coma.


188
0:15:6,804 --> 0:15:8,364
Is this a dream?


189
0:15:8,364 --> 0:15:10,604
Is it my imagination?


190
0:15:10,604 --> 0:15:11,964
Are you an angel?


191
0:15:11,964 --> 0:15:15,284
Look, you don't need
to know everything.


192
0:15:15,284 --> 0:15:18,925
You're in a coma and I'm here to
tell you that you need to wake up.


193
0:15:18,925 --> 0:15:22,164
I don't want to wake up.
I want to be dead.


194
0:15:22,164 --> 0:15:27,285
Why do you think I was on that
bridge in the first place?


195
0:15:27,285 --> 0:15:41,444
Let me show you what the world
would be like without Rae.


196
0:15:41,444 --> 0:15:44,724
This is what happens
if you don't wake up.


197
0:15:44,724 --> 0:15:47,124
It's closed.


198
0:15:47,124 --> 0:15:49,603
Because I don't wake up?
What are you trying to say?


199
0:15:49,603 --> 0:15:51,763
Well, when you stopped coming here,


200
0:15:51,763 --> 0:15:56,84
other people stopped coming here
because it reminded them of you.


201
0:15:56,84 --> 0:16:0,124
A chip shop reminds people of me?!


202
0:16:0,124 --> 0:16:3,524
Maybe this wasn't the best place to
start.


203
0:16:3,524 --> 0:16:4,844
Where are we now?


204
0:16:4,844 --> 0:16:6,445
Her Majesty's Prison, Lincoln.


205
0:16:6,445 --> 0:16:9,644
11 months in the future.


206
0:16:9,644 --> 0:16:13,84
No!


207
0:16:13,84 --> 0:16:16,124
No, no! This can't have happened!


208
0:16:16,124 --> 0:16:19,325
They can't be together -
they're the opposite of each other!


209
0:16:19,325 --> 0:16:21,364
I made you some fairy cakes.


210
0:16:21,364 --> 0:16:23,324
Oh, brilliant.


211
0:16:23,324 --> 0:16:26,165
Well, that's not getting me
beaten up, is it?


212
0:16:26,165 --> 0:16:30,444
What happens to Chop?


213
0:16:30,444 --> 0:16:32,764
Lovely dress, dear.


214
0:16:32,764 --> 0:16:36,83
Victor said that he just doesn't want
to be part of the Country Club any
more.


215
0:16:36,83 --> 0:16:40,164
What about you, Arnold?
Are you a member of any societies?


216
0:16:40,164 --> 0:16:42,164
No, not really.


217
0:16:42,164 --> 0:16:44,524
Chop's name's Arnold?!


218
0:16:44,524 --> 0:16:50,644
Do you want more wine, Arnold?
No thanks, I don't drink no more.


219
0:16:50,644 --> 0:16:54,4
'Come on, honey!'


220
0:16:54,4 --> 0:17:2,685
Oh, not Finn! Not Finn!


221
0:17:2,685 --> 0:17:4,684
What?!


222
0:17:4,684 --> 0:17:7,3
Do you know,
it has been so difficult


223
0:17:7,3 --> 0:17:8,483
but I'm so glad we waited,


224
0:17:8,483 --> 0:17:10,923
cos tonight's going to
be really special.


225
0:17:10,923 --> 0:17:14,245
Oh, you know... you know what?
If we wait until Mauritius,


226
0:17:14,245 --> 0:17:16,364
then it'll be really special.


227
0:17:16,364 --> 0:17:18,603
No, because now's really special.


228
0:17:18,603 --> 0:17:21,125
Ooh, one of the candles
has gone out!


229
0:17:21,125 --> 0:17:30,884
This is horrible. I don't want to
see any more of this.


230
0:17:30,884 --> 0:17:32,4
What the fuck?


231
0:17:32,4 --> 0:17:33,845
Whoops!
What was that last one?


232
0:17:33,845 --> 0:17:38,204
Forget about it.


233
0:17:38,204 --> 0:17:40,84
We were talking today about


234
0:17:40,84 --> 0:17:43,644
what everyone was going to go on to
do and...


235
0:17:43,644 --> 0:17:48,84
I'd always thought that me and you
could've been on the radio together.


236
0:17:48,84 --> 0:17:51,844
Like a joint DJ slot.


237
0:17:51,844 --> 0:17:57,284
No crap. Only cool tunes. No Crap FM.


238
0:17:57,284 --> 0:18:0,484
Look, Rae...


239
0:18:0,484 --> 0:18:3,364
I really miss ya.


240
0:18:3,364 --> 0:18:7,484
It's bullshit that you're gone.
I hate it.


241
0:18:7,484 --> 0:18:9,164
Everyone hates it.


242
0:18:9,164 --> 0:18:11,324
Anyway, look...


243
0:18:11,324 --> 0:18:12,924
He really misses me.


244
0:18:12,924 --> 0:18:14,204
I know.


245
0:18:14,204 --> 0:18:16,524
He really misses me.


246
0:18:16,524 --> 0:18:18,164
Yep.


247
0:18:18,164 --> 0:18:20,765
Will he ever have sex with me
if I wake up?


248
0:18:20,765 --> 0:18:22,644
I can't answer that.


249
0:18:22,644 --> 0:18:24,324
Will he ever kiss me?


250
0:18:24,324 --> 0:18:32,364
I can't answer that either.


251
0:18:32,364 --> 0:18:34,484
Where is everything?


252
0:18:34,484 --> 0:18:35,844
It's gone.


253
0:18:35,844 --> 0:18:37,525
No-one lives here any more.


254
0:18:37,525 --> 0:18:40,684
Why?


255
0:18:40,684 --> 0:18:45,164
Your mum and Karim didn't work out.


256
0:18:45,164 --> 0:18:48,325
She blamed yourself for your death.
She had a breakdown.


257
0:18:48,325 --> 0:18:51,84
Where does she live?


258
0:18:51,84 --> 0:18:52,805
With your Uncle Martin in King's
Lynn.


259
0:18:52,805 --> 0:18:53,884
No!


260
0:18:53,884 --> 0:18:56,243
No, this isn't how it's meant to be!


261
0:18:56,243 --> 0:18:58,843
What?! Did you just think
you could slip out of the world


262
0:18:58,843 --> 0:19:0,845
with nothing happening because of
it?


263
0:19:0,845 --> 0:19:13,684
Do you think anyone can do that?


264
0:19:13,684 --> 0:19:14,923
There's one more reason


265
0:19:14,923 --> 0:19:16,203
why you should wake up.


266
0:19:16,203 --> 0:19:17,443
I don't want to know any more.


267
0:19:17,443 --> 0:19:19,763
No. This is nice. When you wake up,


268
0:19:19,763 --> 0:19:22,405
Finn's at the side of your bed,
holding your hand.


269
0:19:22,405 --> 0:19:25,204
Your mum and Karim are in the
corner.


270
0:19:25,204 --> 0:19:28,4
There's balloons and music.


271
0:19:28,4 --> 0:19:32,964
And it's perfect.


272
0:19:32,964 --> 0:19:35,4
OK.


273
0:19:35,4 --> 0:19:36,444
I'm ready.


274
0:19:36,444 --> 0:19:41,324
Close your eyes.


275
0:19:41,324 --> 0:19:50,324
Good luck!


276
0:19:50,324 --> 0:19:53,124
Oh, my God!


277
0:19:53,124 --> 0:19:55,44
Are you all right?


278
0:19:55,44 --> 0:19:57,483
Why did you step into the road like
that?


279
0:19:57,483 --> 0:20:0,445
How long was I unconscious for?
I don't know.


280
0:20:0,445 --> 0:20:2,204
Maybe a second.


281
0:20:2,204 --> 0:20:4,324
Oh. oh, what about the coma?


282
0:20:4,324 --> 0:20:6,564
What coma?
Oh, no, no!


283
0:20:6,564 --> 0:20:8,365
I don't know what
you're talking about.


284
0:20:8,365 --> 0:20:15,244
Oh, everything's still shit!


285
0:20:15,244 --> 0:20:17,684
Why were you on the bridge?


286
0:20:17,684 --> 0:20:21,284
I was going for a walk.


287
0:20:21,284 --> 0:20:23,845
How can you drive anyway?
I thought you were like 14.


288
0:20:23,845 --> 0:20:25,604
I'm 17.


289
0:20:25,604 --> 0:20:29,804
17 and you still shout names at me
in the street.


290
0:20:29,804 --> 0:20:31,963
Well, you're always looking at us
like knobheads.


291
0:20:31,963 --> 0:20:35,563
That's because you shout the words
"fat bitch" in my face every other
day.


292
0:20:35,563 --> 0:20:39,324
Are you going to tell anyone
that I ran you over?


293
0:20:39,324 --> 0:20:43,84
I don't care enough to tell anyone.


294
0:20:43,84 --> 0:20:51,684
Look, um, sorry for calling you
Jabba and that.


295
0:20:51,684 --> 0:20:54,844
Yeah, well, I don't mind but...


296
0:20:54,844 --> 0:20:58,524
it's so uninventive and so unfunny,


297
0:20:58,524 --> 0:21:0,485
it makes me want to punch myself
in the tit.


298
0:21:0,485 --> 0:21:2,164
I'm sorry.


299
0:21:2,164 --> 0:21:4,5
I didn't know you was all right.


300
0:21:4,5 --> 0:21:5,244
Exactly.


301
0:21:5,244 --> 0:21:8,4
It shouldn't matter.


302
0:21:8,4 --> 0:21:11,4
You don't treat people like dirt.


303
0:21:11,4 --> 0:21:15,204
I already know I'm shit.
I don't need reminding.


304
0:21:15,204 --> 0:21:16,323
Do you want me to ring anyone?


305
0:21:16,323 --> 0:21:18,163
No.
But what about your mum or someone?


306
0:21:18,163 --> 0:21:19,643
No! But what about your mates?


307
0:21:19,643 --> 0:21:23,283
I said "no", all right? Look,
I haven't got anyone to ring anyway.


308
0:21:23,283 --> 0:21:25,643
Why don't you just go home? I said
you didn't have to wait with me.


309
0:21:25,643 --> 0:21:27,763
What were you doing on the bridge?


310
0:21:27,763 --> 0:21:30,885
Look, I'm not going anywhere
until you've rang someone.


311
0:21:30,885 --> 0:21:37,124
Who do you call in an emergency?


312
0:21:37,124 --> 0:22:2,444
'There was one person missing.'


313
0:22:2,444 --> 0:22:3,564
Come in.


314
0:22:3,564 --> 0:22:5,564
I was looking for Kester.


315
0:22:5,564 --> 0:22:7,925
Dr Gill has taken leave of absence.


316
0:22:7,925 --> 0:22:9,404
Oh.


317
0:22:9,404 --> 0:22:13,644
You must be Rae.


318
0:22:13,644 --> 0:22:23,124
Dr Gill said you might be back.


319
0:22:23,124 --> 0:22:25,244
Hello?


320
0:22:25,244 --> 0:22:29,44
Anybody home?


321
0:22:29,44 --> 0:22:40,444
Hello?


322
0:22:40,444 --> 0:22:44,964
Hello? It's Rae.


323
0:22:44,964 --> 0:22:48,284
Rae, what are you doing here?


324
0:22:48,284 --> 0:22:51,645
I called your number
and your wife gave me this address.


325
0:22:51,645 --> 0:23:11,226
Jesus, what have you been doing?


326
0:23:11,226 --> 0:23:14,556
I'm, er, really sorry that you
had to see me like that, Rae.


327
0:23:14,556 --> 0:23:15,915
Like what?


328
0:23:15,915 --> 0:23:21,715
I didn't see anything.


329
0:23:21,715 --> 0:23:25,675
What happened to your
bookshelf?


330
0:23:25,675 --> 0:23:29,347
Oh, yeah, it thought it could
beat me but I had a hammer so


331
0:23:29,347 --> 0:23:33,467
there was only ever gonna
be one winner.


332
0:23:33,467 --> 0:23:38,307
Why are you on leave from work?


333
0:23:38,307 --> 0:23:41,467
Well, I thought...


334
0:23:41,467 --> 0:23:46,387
with what happened with Tix
and then with you leaving...


335
0:23:46,387 --> 0:23:49,948
I thought it would be a good idea
to take some time off and,
you know,


336
0:23:49,948 --> 0:23:58,987
sort myself out.


337
0:23:58,987 --> 0:24:1,787
I like your flat.


338
0:24:1,787 --> 0:24:6,27
Yeah, it's nice, isn't it?


339
0:24:6,27 --> 0:24:8,906
I never thought I'd be living
in a one-bedroom apartment
and, um,


340
0:24:8,906 --> 0:24:14,387
assembling a flat-pack
wine rack in my late 40s.
But there you go.


341
0:24:14,387 --> 0:24:19,147
You know, it's really nice,
it's really nice to have,
um, some...


342
0:24:19,147 --> 0:24:21,427
space.


343
0:24:21,427 --> 0:24:25,507
It's nice to um, have...


344
0:24:25,507 --> 0:24:35,587
a fresh start.


345
0:24:35,587 --> 0:24:37,707
What happened with Tix,


346
0:24:37,707 --> 0:24:39,947
it wasn't your fault.


347
0:24:39,947 --> 0:24:43,67
And me walking out...


348
0:24:43,67 --> 0:24:45,907
wasn't your fault.


349
0:24:45,907 --> 0:24:49,627
I like that you're a mess.


350
0:24:49,627 --> 0:24:52,427
That's what makes you real.


351
0:24:52,427 --> 0:25:7,507
Like us.


352
0:25:7,507 --> 0:25:8,627
Oh...


353
0:25:8,627 --> 0:25:22,587
Yeah...


354
0:25:22,587 --> 0:25:28,387
I nearly did something stupid.


355
0:25:28,387 --> 0:25:30,907
How stupid are we talking?


356
0:25:30,907 --> 0:25:33,787
The stupidest.


357
0:25:33,787 --> 0:25:37,907
What made you want
to do something like that?


358
0:25:37,907 --> 0:25:41,27
I just can't see a way out.


359
0:25:41,27 --> 0:25:43,707
I can't see any way out.


360
0:25:43,707 --> 0:25:46,827
Of what?


361
0:25:46,827 --> 0:25:48,867
Of being me.


362
0:25:48,867 --> 0:25:52,787
Did anything in particular
happen?


363
0:25:52,787 --> 0:25:54,867
Loads of stuff happened.


364
0:25:54,867 --> 0:25:58,787
I was upset about Tixy.


365
0:25:58,787 --> 0:26:0,67
I stood her up.


366
0:26:0,67 --> 0:26:2,147
I forgot all about her.


367
0:26:2,147 --> 0:26:7,787
Look, she over-exercised and
her body couldn't take it.
That's not your fault.


368
0:26:7,787 --> 0:26:9,867
Anything else?


369
0:26:9,867 --> 0:26:12,347
Chloe found my diary.


370
0:26:12,347 --> 0:26:16,427
So know everyone's going to
know how messed up I am.


371
0:26:16,427 --> 0:26:18,507
But that's not everything.


372
0:26:18,507 --> 0:26:21,427
It was my mum's wedding today.


373
0:26:21,427 --> 0:26:25,147
It's the reception now.


374
0:26:25,147 --> 0:26:27,266
She's going to be so angry
that I missed it.


375
0:26:27,266 --> 0:26:30,306
I had a kind of argument with
her this morning.


376
0:26:30,306 --> 0:26:34,347
And she told me that my dad
has never tried to get in
touch.


377
0:26:34,347 --> 0:26:39,507
And that I need to make more
of an effort if I want to be part
of the family.


378
0:26:39,507 --> 0:26:43,347
You've never talked much
about your dad, have you?


379
0:26:43,347 --> 0:26:46,987
He left when I was really little.


380
0:26:46,987 --> 0:26:53,267
And, yes, I'm pretty lucky
in a way cos I never got
to know him.


381
0:26:53,267 --> 0:26:57,547
I'm not angry about it.


382
0:26:57,547 --> 0:27:3,227
I don't even think about him.


383
0:27:3,227 --> 0:27:5,427
I remember when I was seven,


384
0:27:5,427 --> 0:27:7,786
I went over to Chloe's house
for a sleepover


385
0:27:7,786 --> 0:27:12,267
and we got up cos she'd had this
brilliant idea.


386
0:27:12,267 --> 0:27:14,306
She'd been watching people
sledging on TV


387
0:27:14,306 --> 0:27:18,308
and she wanted us to get an empty
pillowcase, put our legs in,


388
0:27:18,308 --> 0:27:22,667
and sledge down the stairs.


389
0:27:22,667 --> 0:27:26,347
Huh... It's funny now but...


390
0:27:26,347 --> 0:27:29,186
we were there crying our eyes
out and Chloe's dad


391
0:27:29,186 --> 0:27:31,106
came running out of the lounge.


392
0:27:31,106 --> 0:27:33,186
And he had to pick one of us
up first.


393
0:27:33,186 --> 0:27:36,28
And he reached over me
and picked up Chloe.


394
0:27:36,28 --> 0:27:39,627
And afterwards,
we were sitting in the lounge


395
0:27:39,627 --> 0:27:44,67
and her dad, well, he just sat
with her on his lap.


396
0:27:44,67 --> 0:27:46,827
He stroked her hair.


397
0:27:46,827 --> 0:27:47,908
Did you wish it was you?


398
0:27:47,908 --> 0:27:49,267
Maybe.


399
0:27:49,267 --> 0:27:51,827
I don't know.


400
0:27:51,827 --> 0:27:54,228
I guess I just feel like
I missed out on something.


401
0:27:54,228 --> 0:27:57,227
I felt sad about that.


402
0:27:57,227 --> 0:28:0,707
I still feel sad about that.


403
0:28:0,707 --> 0:28:3,67
I mean...


404
0:28:3,67 --> 0:28:5,227
it's not fair, is it?


405
0:28:5,227 --> 0:28:8,148
That little seven-year-old
doesn't have a dad.


406
0:28:8,148 --> 0:28:9,987
It's not her fault.
Er,


407
0:28:9,987 --> 0:28:12,748
you are that seven-year-old, Rae.
You're talking about yourself.


408
0:28:12,748 --> 0:28:14,307
Yeah, I know I am.


409
0:28:14,307 --> 0:28:16,267
But what I'm saying is...


410
0:28:16,267 --> 0:28:19,308
it's not right to do that to
a seven-year-old.


411
0:28:19,308 --> 0:28:22,147
To do that to you.
To leave you.


412
0:28:22,147 --> 0:28:23,707
Fine.


413
0:28:23,707 --> 0:28:27,387
It's not fucking right
to do that to me.


414
0:28:27,387 --> 0:28:30,827
I wouldn't do that
if I were someone's parent.


415
0:28:30,827 --> 0:28:33,67
I wouldn't do that.


416
0:28:33,67 --> 0:28:35,548
So why do I have to wind up
with some prick for a dad


417
0:28:35,548 --> 0:28:38,827
who doesn't even want to see
his own kid?!


418
0:28:38,827 --> 0:28:41,627
His own fucking kid.


419
0:28:41,627 --> 0:28:44,307
He doesn't even know what
I'm like.


420
0:28:44,307 --> 0:28:59,387
He doesn't deserve to know
you, Rae.


421
0:28:59,387 --> 0:29:1,587
What?


422
0:29:1,587 --> 0:29:2,828
How do you do that?


423
0:29:2,828 --> 0:29:4,27
Do what?


424
0:29:4,27 --> 0:29:9,867
Five minutes ago, I said I wasn't
even angry about it.


425
0:29:9,867 --> 0:29:13,227
I didn't do anything.


426
0:29:13,227 --> 0:29:15,67
Rae!


427
0:29:15,67 --> 0:29:19,227
Rae, look at me.


428
0:29:19,227 --> 0:29:21,788
Whatever situation you find
yourself in,


429
0:29:21,788 --> 0:29:26,787
there is always, always,
always a way out. Yeah?


430
0:29:26,787 --> 0:29:28,67
Yeah.


431
0:29:28,67 --> 0:29:31,986
I am not going to leave you and I am
not going to give up on you.


432
0:29:31,986 --> 0:29:35,386
And your dad did whatever your dad
did. Not because of anything you did.


433
0:29:35,386 --> 0:29:37,786
And not because of anything
you are.


434
0:29:37,786 --> 0:29:42,147
So you can't spend the rest of
your life being afraid of
people rejecting you.


435
0:29:42,147 --> 0:29:44,508
You have to start
by not rejecting yourself.


436
0:29:44,508 --> 0:29:46,987
You don't deserve it.


437
0:29:46,987 --> 0:29:50,668
So, from now on, people either accept
you for who you are,


438
0:29:50,668 --> 0:29:52,67
or they can fuck off


439
0:29:52,67 --> 0:29:59,427
because you're an amazing
person, Rae.


440
0:29:59,427 --> 0:30:1,748
I think we can probably still,
er, make the reception.


441
0:30:1,748 --> 0:30:3,547
No...


442
0:30:3,547 --> 0:30:5,27
I can't go.


443
0:30:5,27 --> 0:30:7,827
I can't face them all.


444
0:30:7,827 --> 0:30:9,27
Yeah...


445
0:30:9,27 --> 0:30:12,147
Yeah, I think you can.


446
0:30:12,147 --> 0:30:22,387
Come on.


447
0:30:22,387 --> 0:30:24,307
Oh...!


448
0:30:24,307 --> 0:30:26,387
Stupid bloody dress!


449
0:30:26,387 --> 0:30:27,747
Oh...


450
0:30:27,747 --> 0:30:29,947
Don't turn around!


451
0:30:29,947 --> 0:30:41,667
I'm not turning around.


452
0:30:41,667 --> 0:30:44,507
I'm ready.


453
0:30:44,507 --> 0:30:47,27
Wow!


454
0:30:47,27 --> 0:30:48,827
Do I look all right?


455
0:30:48,827 --> 0:30:52,507
You look fantastic.
Right.


456
0:30:52,507 --> 0:30:54,107
Let's do this.


457
0:30:54,107 --> 0:30:57,947
I'm not going in.


458
0:30:57,947 --> 0:31:0,387
What?


459
0:31:0,387 --> 0:31:2,387
I can't go in on my own.


460
0:31:2,387 --> 0:31:11,427
Yes, you can.


461
0:31:11,427 --> 0:31:14,467
Go on.


462
0:31:14,467 --> 0:31:17,547
Go on!


463
0:31:17,547 --> 0:31:54,27
Just...


464
0:31:54,27 --> 0:32:0,467
This is awful.
Maybe I can just hide.


465
0:32:0,467 --> 0:32:5,307
Oh, my goodness. I am so
sorry I'm late.


466
0:32:5,307 --> 0:32:6,907
Wow, Mrs Hottie-Pants!


467
0:32:6,907 --> 0:32:8,307
Look at you!


468
0:32:8,307 --> 0:32:12,107
Right, where did you get to
last night?


469
0:32:12,107 --> 0:32:14,786
I had to get a taxi back about
three-ish to escape from that
drug-dealer man.


470
0:32:14,786 --> 0:32:17,708
Really?
Izzy, where the fuck have
you been?


471
0:32:17,708 --> 0:32:19,187
At home. Why?


472
0:32:19,187 --> 0:32:21,827
I was worried about ya.
Everyone was.


473
0:32:21,827 --> 0:32:23,988
What happened between
you and Kendo?
How do you care?


474
0:32:23,988 --> 0:32:26,107
I don't. I just...


475
0:32:26,107 --> 0:32:32,707
Just do what you want, yeah?


476
0:32:32,707 --> 0:32:47,427
Um, Rae, can I have a word,
please?


477
0:32:47,427 --> 0:32:52,107
Right, I'm only here because
of your mum.


478
0:32:52,107 --> 0:32:53,746
I don't know what to say.


479
0:32:53,746 --> 0:32:57,466
Have you told everyone?
No, I haven't told everyone, Rae.


480
0:32:57,466 --> 0:33:0,68
And do you know why?
Because I'm a good person.


481
0:33:0,68 --> 0:33:2,107
I know you're a good person.


482
0:33:2,107 --> 0:33:5,906
I won't tell anyone, Rae, but
you need to stay away from us.


483
0:33:5,906 --> 0:33:8,26
I don't want to be anywhere
near you.


484
0:33:8,26 --> 0:33:25,419
And they were my friends first,
so that's the way it's going to be.


485
0:33:25,419 --> 0:33:33,539
'There's a feeling I get.
And its roots are deep and rotten.


486
0:33:33,539 --> 0:33:36,838
'It's when you realise
something is fading into a memory


487
0:33:36,838 --> 0:33:49,614
'before your very eyes.'


488
0:33:49,614 --> 0:33:51,535
Hi. Hi, everyone.


489
0:33:51,535 --> 0:33:54,414
I know it's usually the groom
who says a few words.


490
0:33:54,414 --> 0:33:57,576
But we thought it'd be better
if I took the honours.


491
0:33:57,576 --> 0:33:59,455
Um...


492
0:33:59,455 --> 0:34:1,455
Oh, Karim...


493
0:34:1,455 --> 0:34:3,495
my beastie.


494
0:34:3,495 --> 0:34:6,401
I love you so much.


495
0:34:6,401 --> 0:34:7,201
Aw!


496
0:34:7,201 --> 0:34:8,96
I want him to feel at home tonight,
OK?


497
0:34:8,96 --> 0:34:14,361
So let's all show him
how we party in Lincolnshire!


498
0:34:14,361 --> 0:34:16,401
We've both...


499
0:34:16,401 --> 0:34:20,641
Yeah, we've had quite a difficult
time recently, so it's, um,


500
0:34:20,641 --> 0:34:22,722
it's really nice that we've got
something


501
0:34:22,722 --> 0:34:28,481
we can all celebrate... together.


502
0:34:28,481 --> 0:34:34,481
Does anyone else
want to say anything?


503
0:34:34,481 --> 0:34:35,641
Fuck it.


504
0:34:35,641 --> 0:34:45,321
Yeah, I do.


505
0:34:45,321 --> 0:34:48,322
Hello.


506
0:34:48,322 --> 0:34:49,362
Hello.


507
0:34:49,362 --> 0:34:51,82
Er... um...


508
0:34:51,82 --> 0:34:56,2
Well, firstly, I just want to say
congratulations to my mum and Karim.


509
0:34:56,2 --> 0:34:59,882
I'm really sorry
I missed the ceremony.


510
0:34:59,882 --> 0:35:3,682
Karim makes my mum really happy.


511
0:35:3,682 --> 0:35:6,202
And that's all I care about.


512
0:35:6,202 --> 0:35:9,83
Well, that's all anyone
should care about.


513
0:35:9,83 --> 0:35:10,602
Hear, hear.


514
0:35:10,602 --> 0:35:13,162
And we deserve a bit of happiness.


515
0:35:13,162 --> 0:35:15,362
We deserve to smile more and...


516
0:35:15,362 --> 0:35:18,115
we've definitely done that
since he arrived.


517
0:35:18,115 --> 0:35:25,234
Hooray!


518
0:35:25,234 --> 0:35:27,434
Um...


519
0:35:27,434 --> 0:35:30,354
And the second thing is...


520
0:35:30,354 --> 0:35:35,514
I just want to tell everyone
the truth about me.


521
0:35:35,514 --> 0:35:37,374
Um...


522
0:35:37,374 --> 0:35:42,94
in the spring,
I was admitted to a mental home


523
0:35:42,94 --> 0:35:45,134
because I kept trying
to hurt myself.


524
0:35:45,134 --> 0:35:47,294
I'm actually mad.


525
0:35:47,294 --> 0:35:51,94
And I do really weird things like...


526
0:35:51,94 --> 0:35:54,855
I turn light switches on and off
in divisions of eight.


527
0:35:54,855 --> 0:35:57,54
I've... I've cut myself.


528
0:35:57,54 --> 0:35:59,854
Um, I burn myself with hot water.


529
0:35:59,854 --> 0:36:2,933
Well, I used to. And I've got this
really funny relationship


530
0:36:2,933 --> 0:36:5,686
with the larder in our house
where my mum keeps


531
0:36:5,686 --> 0:36:7,86
sweets and biscuits and crisps,


532
0:36:7,86 --> 0:36:9,888
and all the things that we shouldn't
eat.


533
0:36:9,888 --> 0:36:14,87
Sorry, Mum. Um...


534
0:36:14,87 --> 0:36:17,167
And, er, I keep a diary...


535
0:36:17,167 --> 0:36:19,207
of all my thoughts.


536
0:36:19,207 --> 0:36:23,567
And most of the time, I don't even
think about what I'm writing.


537
0:36:23,567 --> 0:36:27,247
Like when I write
about my friends...


538
0:36:27,247 --> 0:36:29,567
when they make me angry.


539
0:36:29,567 --> 0:36:34,407
But it doesn't mean
that I don't love them.


540
0:36:34,407 --> 0:36:35,767
And, you know,


541
0:36:35,767 --> 0:36:37,487
I write a lot about boys.


542
0:36:37,487 --> 0:36:42,687
I fantasise quite a lot about,
um, doctors, teachers,


543
0:36:42,687 --> 0:36:45,447
actors, pop stars, any man


544
0:36:45,447 --> 0:36:51,287
that I've come in contact with
anywhere, really. But...


545
0:36:51,287 --> 0:36:57,167
Well, some more than others.


546
0:36:57,167 --> 0:37:0,287
So, um, well, that's the truth.


547
0:37:0,287 --> 0:37:1,887
So, thanks.


548
0:37:1,887 --> 0:37:20,527
Thanks for listening.


549
0:37:20,527 --> 0:37:22,87
Hello! Hello!


550
0:37:22,87 --> 0:37:25,7
I say, vive I'amour!


551
0:37:25,7 --> 0:37:29,527
Vive la vie!


552
0:37:29,527 --> 0:37:32,288
I need to say something.
I need to say something.


553
0:37:32,288 --> 0:37:35,407
Izzy, I fuckin' love you.


554
0:37:35,407 --> 0:37:36,848
It's the truth. I love ya.


555
0:37:36,848 --> 0:37:47,87
Come here.


556
0:37:47,87 --> 0:37:49,848
I need to say...
I need to say something.


557
0:37:49,848 --> 0:37:53,367
I'm, er...


558
0:37:53,367 --> 0:37:59,207
Er, I'm just so pleased
to be included in your special day


559
0:37:59,207 --> 0:38:1,248
and the wonderful celebration.


560
0:38:1,248 --> 0:38:5,767
Aw.


561
0:38:5,767 --> 0:38:13,407
Come here, babe.


562
0:38:13,407 --> 0:38:18,647
Come out here.


563
0:38:18,647 --> 0:38:22,967
That was very brave of you.


564
0:38:22,967 --> 0:38:25,807
You look like you're having
a nice time.


565
0:38:25,807 --> 0:38:28,727
I'm having an awful time, Rae.


566
0:38:28,727 --> 0:38:30,247
Why? What happened?


567
0:38:30,247 --> 0:38:39,207
My best friend never came
to my wedding.


568
0:38:39,207 --> 0:38:41,248
I had to think about everything
today.


569
0:38:41,248 --> 0:38:42,847
And...


570
0:38:42,847 --> 0:38:45,807
I know this morning
I said I was fine


571
0:38:45,807 --> 0:38:52,287
about the letters
and about Dad, but...


572
0:38:52,287 --> 0:38:55,167
I'm not fine.


573
0:38:55,167 --> 0:38:59,847
I don't think I've been fine for
years. Well...


574
0:38:59,847 --> 0:39:2,206
I wrote them because I wanted to
make you feel


575
0:39:2,206 --> 0:39:3,648
like you had someone there.


576
0:39:3,648 --> 0:39:6,247
Mum...


577
0:39:6,247 --> 0:39:13,727
I did have someone there.


578
0:39:13,727 --> 0:39:18,167
Have I still got a chance
to be part of this family?


579
0:39:18,167 --> 0:39:20,447
Rae!


580
0:39:20,447 --> 0:39:25,7
You are this family!


581
0:39:25,7 --> 0:39:27,288
I love you more than anything
on earth.


582
0:39:27,288 --> 0:39:30,287
If I didn't, I'd be in Tunisia,
wouldn't I?


583
0:39:30,287 --> 0:39:35,727
Where it's 30 bloody degrees
every day!


584
0:39:35,727 --> 0:39:41,247
Come here.


585
0:39:41,247 --> 0:39:44,167
Mum?


586
0:39:44,167 --> 0:39:46,726
We'll never be a hugging family,
will we?


587
0:39:46,726 --> 0:39:48,528
May I have the bride and groom,
please?


588
0:39:48,528 --> 0:39:53,967
Right, that's me, so come on!


589
0:39:53,967 --> 0:39:55,847
Hi, everyone. Hi, again.


590
0:39:55,847 --> 0:39:59,967
Oh, look, thank you for coming
to celebrate our wedding.


591
0:39:59,967 --> 0:40:1,607
We really appreciate it


592
0:40:1,607 --> 0:40:5,128
and we wondered if you'd join us
in our first dance.


593
0:40:5,128 --> 0:40:35,47
It's a really special song for us.


594
0:40:35,47 --> 0:40:37,88
I can't believe
you just did that.


595
0:40:37,88 --> 0:40:39,7
Listen, Chloe,


596
0:40:39,7 --> 0:40:42,126
the things you read,
like the things about Archie,


597
0:40:42,126 --> 0:40:44,486
I don't care what you tell people
about me


598
0:40:44,486 --> 0:40:48,168
but you can't say anything
about anyone else, it's not fair.


599
0:40:48,168 --> 0:40:51,727
What things?


600
0:40:51,727 --> 0:40:55,927
Look, Rae, what I said in there,
I didn't mean it.


601
0:40:55,927 --> 0:41:7,207
Look, you can have it back.


602
0:41:7,207 --> 0:41:8,646
This is what you're angry about?


603
0:41:8,646 --> 0:41:14,607
Wouldn't you be angry
if your best mate said you didn't
deserve someone?


604
0:41:14,607 --> 0:41:16,687
Oi, what are you laughing at?


605
0:41:16,687 --> 0:41:18,727
Chloe!


606
0:41:18,727 --> 0:41:21,927
What? I didn't mean it.


607
0:41:21,927 --> 0:41:24,326
Well, me and Finn
aren't going out now anyway.


608
0:41:24,326 --> 0:41:29,447
You know, we spoke about it and we
just decided we're different people.


609
0:41:29,447 --> 0:41:30,607
Oh...


610
0:41:30,607 --> 0:41:32,368
Now, we both know
that's total bollocks,


611
0:41:32,368 --> 0:41:34,967
because he's not interested.


612
0:41:34,967 --> 0:41:38,527
So, you're welcome to him, I guess.


613
0:41:38,527 --> 0:41:39,807
Am I a bitch, Rae?


614
0:41:39,807 --> 0:41:41,46
Everyone can be a bitch.


615
0:41:41,46 --> 0:41:43,648
Yeah, but it's like
some more than others, isn't it?


616
0:41:43,648 --> 0:41:47,927
Chloe...


617
0:41:47,927 --> 0:41:49,408
you're not a bitch.


618
0:41:49,408 --> 0:41:51,287
All right then, I'm not.


619
0:41:51,287 --> 0:41:54,7
You coming in? Yeah.


620
0:41:54,7 --> 0:41:56,446
The precious gift of
one of the greatest songs


621
0:41:56,446 --> 0:41:58,526
of all time. And if anyone asks you


622
0:41:58,526 --> 0:42:1,168
who made you rock out to this,
you tell them


623
0:42:1,168 --> 0:42:2,967
it was Arnold Peters.


624
0:42:2,967 --> 0:42:4,847
Yeah?


625
0:42:4,847 --> 0:42:8,127
? How many special people
change?


626
0:42:8,127 --> 0:42:11,647
? How many lives are living strange?


627
0:42:11,647 --> 0:42:17,87
? Where were you
while we were getting high...? ?


628
0:42:17,87 --> 0:42:19,247
Archie? Yeah?


629
0:42:19,247 --> 0:42:21,327
Where's Finn?


630
0:42:21,327 --> 0:42:23,688
Er, he said something about
going to the chippy.


631
0:42:23,688 --> 0:42:28,607
? ..Where were you
while we were getting high? ?


632
0:42:28,607 --> 0:43:7,327
? Someday you will find me
Caught beneath the landslide


633
0:43:7,327 --> 0:43:8,727
Finn.


634
0:43:8,727 --> 0:43:10,567
Why didn't you tell me?


635
0:43:10,567 --> 0:43:17,408
I'm so sorry.


636
0:43:17,408 --> 0:43:19,967
I...I want to tell you something.


637
0:43:19,967 --> 0:43:23,487
What?


638
0:43:23,487 --> 0:43:26,166
I'm not... I'm no good with words.
I'm not...


639
0:43:26,166 --> 0:43:53,967
I'm no good with speaking.


640
0:43:53,967 --> 0:43:55,967
Finn...


641
0:43:55,967 --> 0:44:0,608
don't say it if you don't mean it.


642
0:44:0,608 --> 0:44:2,727
I don't believe you.


643
0:44:2,727 --> 0:44:13,127
I don't... I don't care
if you don't believe me.


644
0:44:13,127 --> 0:44:45,367
So, what now?


645
0:44:45,367 --> 0:44:47,526
Your Auntie Bet's got terrible
spelling.


646
0:44:47,526 --> 0:44:52,527
"Congratulations on your weeding."


647
0:44:52,527 --> 0:44:55,847
Aw, thanks for my wedding card, Rae.


648
0:44:55,847 --> 0:44:57,167
What wedding card?


649
0:44:57,167 --> 0:45:1,887
The one you left on your desk.


650
0:45:1,887 --> 0:45:7,927
Oh, fuck!


651
0:45:7,927 --> 0:45:10,767
That's not for you.


652
0:45:10,767 --> 0:45:12,928
Oh, who else?
It's for your other mum, is it?


653
0:45:12,928 --> 0:45:18,567
Well, you talk more
random shite sometimes, you.


654
0:45:18,567 --> 0:45:19,927
Ooh!


655
0:45:19,927 --> 0:45:26,567
They are... Er, it is their... home
in...


656
0:45:26,567 --> 0:45:34,47
They had born... They are born.


657
0:45:34,47 --> 0:46:3,7
Les petite oiseaux,
puisque ils sont jeunes...


658
0:46:3,7 --> 0:46:7,7
So why don't you tell me
how you're feeling?


659
0:46:7,7 --> 0:46:9,407
Same old.


660
0:46:9,407 --> 0:46:11,566
I just wish I could make Tix better.


661
0:46:11,566 --> 0:46:16,367
Well, it's a good sign
that she made it through the night.


662
0:46:16,367 --> 0:46:19,7
So I... I don't get where I am.


663
0:46:19,7 --> 0:46:22,767
I tried to do something stupid.


664
0:46:22,767 --> 0:46:26,48
So, do you think
I need to come back into hospital?


665
0:46:26,48 --> 0:46:29,87
No.


666
0:46:29,87 --> 0:46:30,728
So do you think I'm better?


667
0:46:30,728 --> 0:46:32,447
No.


668
0:46:32,447 --> 0:46:34,247
So, what?


669
0:46:34,247 --> 0:48:34,247
I think you're ready
to start therapy.
