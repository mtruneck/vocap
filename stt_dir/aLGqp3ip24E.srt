0:0:17,6 --> 0:0:19,63
NICK SWARDSON: Hey this is Nick
Swardson, and this is


3
0:0:19,63 --> 0:0:21,25
probably the craziest
party that I


4
0:0:21,25 --> 0:0:23,89
remember from my childhood.


5
0:0:23,89 --> 0:0:28,1
I was 14 years old and I hung
out with a lot of the shady


6
0:0:28,1 --> 0:0:29,7
and the shady crowd.


7
0:0:29,7 --> 0:0:31,16
We had Starter jackets
and silver


8
0:0:31,16 --> 0:0:33,74
chains and hats on sideways.


9
0:0:33,74 --> 0:0:36,515
So there was this one kid who
was like extra shitty.


10
0:0:36,515 --> 0:0:39,33
He was crashing in this
abandoned house--


11
0:0:39,33 --> 0:0:42,97
like super old, like the
yard was all cruddy.


12
0:0:42,97 --> 0:0:45,61
One night we're like, let's just
fucking break in there


13
0:0:45,61 --> 0:0:47,91
and like we'll throw
a big-ass party.


14
0:0:47,91 --> 0:0:49,99
So we go into this place,
we get a fucking bunch


15
0:0:49,99 --> 0:0:50,68
of bottles of booze.


16
0:0:50,68 --> 0:0:53,1
And we're partying and we're
boozing, we're just pounding


17
0:0:53,1 --> 0:0:55,71
vodka, whatever the hell we
can get our hands on.


18
0:0:55,71 --> 0:0:57,63
Anything that was breakable,
we would break.


19
0:0:57,63 --> 0:1:0,38
We would break light bulbs,
threw the bathtub down the


20
0:1:0,38 --> 0:1:4,41
stairs, we were graffiti-ing So
we just totally decimated


21
0:1:4,41 --> 0:1:5,2
this house.


22
0:1:5,2 --> 0:1:9,14
And then everybody was like
starting to pass out.


23
0:1:9,14 --> 0:1:12,36
So this kid decides to go up on
the top floor and throw a


24
0:1:12,36 --> 0:1:14,13
Molotov cocktail.


25
0:1:14,13 --> 0:1:15,95
So he lights a Molotov
cocktail, throws


26
0:1:15,95 --> 0:1:16,94
it against the wall.


27
0:1:16,94 --> 0:1:19,7
Of course has no plan on how
to put the fucking fire out


28
0:1:19,7 --> 0:1:20,74
that he just set.


29
0:1:20,74 --> 0:1:23,22
So he ran downstairs and was
screaming, and we were all


30
0:1:23,22 --> 0:1:24,6
like hung over and fucking
fucked up.


31
0:1:24,6 --> 0:1:26,83
He was like, we got to get
the fuck out of here.


32
0:1:26,83 --> 0:1:29,43
So we all escape out
of this house, and


33
0:1:29,43 --> 0:1:31,22
it's totally torched.


34
0:1:31,22 --> 0:1:33,77
The next day there was cops
everywhere just around the


35
0:1:33,77 --> 0:1:34,4
neighborhood.


36
0:1:34,4 --> 0:1:35,96
We looked out the window, we
were smoking weed which made


37
0:1:35,96 --> 0:1:37,1
it even more paranoid.


38
0:1:37,1 --> 0:1:39,4
And I turned to my buddy, I go,
we got to get the fuck out


39
0:1:39,4 --> 0:1:39,42
of here, man.


40
0:1:39,42 --> 0:1:41,39
The cops are going to come,
they're going to find us.


41
0:1:41,39 --> 0:1:43,475
So I took off my Starter jacket,
I took off my chains,


42
0:1:43,475 --> 0:1:44,75
took off my hat.


43
0:1:44,75 --> 0:1:47,82
I put on a Polo shirt that I
found in his closet and I put


44
0:1:47,82 --> 0:1:50,43
on these tiny little
tennis shorts.


45
0:1:50,43 --> 0:1:52,64
And I grabbed a tennis racquet,
and I walked out the


46
0:1:52,64 --> 0:1:55,51
back of his door and walked in
through this whole sea of


47
0:1:55,51 --> 0:1:57,38
police and they're all
staring at me.


48
0:1:57,38 --> 0:1:59,27
I'm walking with my tennis
racquet, and I look like this


49
0:1:59,27 --> 0:2:1,71
nice kid from the '80s.


50
0:2:1,71 --> 0:2:5,8
The city bus pulls up and I jump
on it and I take it home


51
0:2:5,8 --> 0:2:7,5
like 10 blocks to my house.


52
0:2:7,5 --> 0:2:9,22
And I called my friend and I
was like, I made it home.


53
0:2:9,22 --> 0:2:11,84
And just as I talked to him on
the phone, the cops broke in


54
0:2:11,84 --> 0:2:13,6
the door and they were
all arrested.


55
0:2:13,6 --> 0:2:15,3
I was the only one
that got away.


56
0:2:15,3 --> 0:2:16,28
Yep.


57
0:2:16,28 --> 0:4:16,28
