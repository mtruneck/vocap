2
0:0:13,89 --> 0:0:14,67
MALE SPEAKER: Good afternoon.


3
0:0:14,67 --> 0:0:19,39
I hope everyone is having a
wonderful Big Tent Conference.


4
0:0:19,39 --> 0:0:24,22
We do this because we care
a lot about information.


5
0:0:24,22 --> 0:0:27,8
We care exactly for the same
reasons you do, because of the


6
0:0:27,8 --> 0:0:29,5
impact that it can have.


7
0:0:29,5 --> 0:0:31,81



8
0:0:31,81 --> 0:0:36,86
I think about what these
devices represent.


9
0:0:36,86 --> 0:0:41,61
When I look at this, I say
to myself, Oh my God.


10
0:0:41,61 --> 0:0:44,62
This device is really a
small supercomputer.


11
0:0:44,62 --> 0:0:47,99
And this is a slightly larger
supercomputer, all connected


12
0:0:47,99 --> 0:0:51,91
over this fast network to
these powerful servers.


13
0:0:51,91 --> 0:0:55,79
But then I realize that this is
just really the beginning


14
0:0:55,79 --> 0:0:58,73
of something much,
much bigger.


15
0:0:58,73 --> 0:1:1,1
And the numbers tell
the story.


16
0:1:1,1 --> 0:1:4,76
There are now 1.3 million
activations of


17
0:1:4,76 --> 0:1:8,32
Android devices per day.


18
0:1:8,32 --> 0:1:11,29
And that number has doubled
in the last six months.


19
0:1:11,29 --> 0:1:13,86
A little bit of math will tell
you that we're on our way to


20
0:1:13,86 --> 0:1:17,43
more than a billion or so of
these kinds of devices pretty


21
0:1:17,43 --> 0:1:20,6
soon, there are more than
a half a billion now.


22
0:1:20,6 --> 0:1:21,86
And of course everyone's waiting
for the announcement


23
0:1:21,86 --> 0:1:25,12
of the major competitor
on Friday.


24
0:1:25,12 --> 0:1:26,63
And everyone's very excited
about that, which is


25
0:1:26,63 --> 0:1:27,23
wonderful--


26
0:1:27,23 --> 0:1:30,75
another great competitor, a
smaller percentage than we


27
0:1:30,75 --> 0:1:32,23
have at this point.


28
0:1:32,23 --> 0:1:34,72
The fact of the matter is that
both these platforms are


29
0:1:34,72 --> 0:1:39,64
completely changing everything
we do, the way we live, the


30
0:1:39,64 --> 0:1:42,63
way we operate in
so many ways.


31
0:1:42,63 --> 0:1:45,35
It would never have occurred to
me in all my years of doing


32
0:1:45,35 --> 0:1:48,83
this sort of thing that you'd
have start-ups that would all


33
0:1:48,83 --> 0:1:52,17
be about what people want, what
information they want,


34
0:1:52,17 --> 0:1:54,45
how to meet other people, where
they should go, what


35
0:1:54,45 --> 0:1:56,87
they should do, how they should
entertain themselves.


36
0:1:56,87 --> 0:1:58,71
But not only are those start-ups
being formed,


37
0:1:58,71 --> 0:2:0,86
especially here in New York,
but they're going to be


38
0:2:0,86 --> 0:2:4,84
successful because of the
sheer logic of numbers.


39
0:2:4,84 --> 0:2:10,919
But even more interesting is to
imagine what's going to be


40
0:2:10,919 --> 0:2:15,8
possible with these devices
over the next few years.


41
0:2:15,8 --> 0:2:19,46
Imagine these not just as pieces
of hardware but as


42
0:2:19,46 --> 0:2:20,99
ecosystems.


43
0:2:20,99 --> 0:2:24,5
Ecosystems that are highly
personal that you've opted


44
0:2:24,5 --> 0:2:26,88
into, so you've let us know
these things, where we can


45
0:2:26,88 --> 0:2:28,89
help give you advice.


46
0:2:28,89 --> 0:2:30,73
They serve as your assistant.


47
0:2:30,73 --> 0:2:32,68
They suggest things.


48
0:2:32,68 --> 0:2:34,79
This is all in the works.


49
0:2:34,79 --> 0:2:40,55
So now imagine a few
steps farther.


50
0:2:40,55 --> 0:2:42,6
What does the future
look like?


51
0:2:42,6 --> 0:2:43,89
This is not the end.


52
0:2:43,89 --> 0:2:45,61
This is the beginning.


53
0:2:45,61 --> 0:2:48,76
And this is where it gets
particularly interesting.


54
0:2:48,76 --> 0:2:52,45
All of us have been trapped in
this model, the traditional PC


55
0:2:52,45 --> 0:2:55,26
model of everything
right there.


56
0:2:55,26 --> 0:2:58,7
The most interesting thing about
computers is that they


57
0:2:58,7 --> 0:3:3,25
almost disappear because they
become so commonplace.


58
0:3:3,25 --> 0:3:5,77
I'll give you a scenario.


59
0:3:5,77 --> 0:3:9,62
When you wake up in the morning,
the room is alive.


60
0:3:9,62 --> 0:3:13,13
And the room knows roughly how
to wake you at the optimal


61
0:3:13,13 --> 0:3:14,89
point in your REM cycle.


62
0:3:14,89 --> 0:3:17,45
It knows what you need in the
morning and it alerts you


63
0:3:17,45 --> 0:3:20,85
through complex and powerful
screens the things that you


64
0:3:20,85 --> 0:3:23,47
care about, so that you know
whether you have a crisis


65
0:3:23,47 --> 0:3:27,34
today or whether you can relax
and stay in bed for a while.


66
0:3:27,34 --> 0:3:29,18
Pretty straightforward.


67
0:3:29,18 --> 0:3:31,73
What's interesting about
this new world


68
0:3:31,73 --> 0:3:33,7
is that these devices--


69
0:3:33,7 --> 0:3:37,94
again all opt-in, all in ways
that you've set up--


70
0:3:37,94 --> 0:3:40,61
help you every day
along the way.


71
0:3:40,61 --> 0:3:43,6
Not only do they measure your
heart rate and how you're


72
0:3:43,6 --> 0:3:47,31
doing, but they also make your
life so much more efficient.


73
0:3:47,31 --> 0:3:52,0
How much time do you spend,
wasting, making travel


74
0:3:52,0 --> 0:3:54,97
reservations, trying to figure
out where the bus is, how do I


75
0:3:54,97 --> 0:3:56,81
get from here to there,
and so forth.


76
0:3:56,81 --> 0:4:1,39
They anticipate what you need,
where you're going, because of


77
0:4:1,39 --> 0:4:4,6
the things that you have told
it, the things that


78
0:4:4,6 --> 0:4:5,62
it thinks you want.


79
0:4:5,62 --> 0:4:8,91
And all of a sudden you begin
to realize it's not just an


80
0:4:8,91 --> 0:4:12,78
assistant, it's really a
very smart assistant.


81
0:4:12,78 --> 0:4:15,4
Now as these devices get
stronger and as they become


82
0:4:15,4 --> 0:4:19,99
more capable, they can
do other things.


83
0:4:19,99 --> 0:4:24,41
Now there's no better example
of this than in medicine.


84
0:4:24,41 --> 0:4:29,74
The app that I want, I
call, Where's My Mom.


85
0:4:29,74 --> 0:4:33,32
Many people have elderly
parents.


86
0:4:33,32 --> 0:4:37,24
I want computers to help monitor
how my mom's doing.


87
0:4:37,24 --> 0:4:38,85
How was her day?


88
0:4:38,85 --> 0:4:38,78
Is she good?


89
0:4:38,78 --> 0:4:40,41
Is she bad?


90
0:4:40,41 --> 0:4:43,77
In case there's some alert or
something that she needs.


91
0:4:43,77 --> 0:4:46,97
The good news is she's in good
health but you never know.


92
0:4:46,97 --> 0:4:47,86
Why can't we do that?


93
0:4:47,86 --> 0:4:49,7
Well, in fact people
are building those


94
0:4:49,7 --> 0:4:50,97
devices right now.


95
0:4:50,97 --> 0:4:53,68
But now let's go one
step further.


96
0:4:53,68 --> 0:4:57,51
Eventually over the next decade,
you'll be able to


97
0:4:57,51 --> 0:5:1,29
actually have things that you
ingest, it will transmit


98
0:5:1,29 --> 0:5:7,24
through WiFi, it will say what's
going on inside of you.


99
0:5:7,24 --> 0:5:9,1
You can decide if you want
to do this or not.


100
0:5:9,1 --> 0:5:10,69
But trust me, your health
will be better.


101
0:5:10,69 --> 0:5:13,51
You guys don't look like you're
very happy about this.


102
0:5:13,51 --> 0:5:16,83
But people are developing
this stuff now.


103
0:5:16,83 --> 0:5:19,23
What about transdermal
measurement?


104
0:5:19,23 --> 0:5:20,11
These are devices--


105
0:5:20,11 --> 0:5:23,95
you hold your phone and again
without pricking your skin, it


106
0:5:23,95 --> 0:5:26,59
can measure your blood pressure,
your various other


107
0:5:26,59 --> 0:5:28,9
vital signs, and so forth.


108
0:5:28,9 --> 0:5:32,5
We're going to build the systems
so the doctor calls


109
0:5:32,5 --> 0:5:35,35
you and says, you better get
yourself to the hospital right


110
0:5:35,35 --> 0:5:39,17
now, rather than you
calling the doctor.


111
0:5:39,17 --> 0:5:43,16
And that's the ultimate
inversion of this model, that


112
0:5:43,16 --> 0:5:45,83
these devices, that the
micro-miniaturization, the


113
0:5:45,83 --> 0:5:49,32
technology that we've taken
that's been so heavy and hard


114
0:5:49,32 --> 0:5:53,71
to use for most of us becomes
embedded inside of us.


115
0:5:53,71 --> 0:5:56,53
There's a new generation of
technology, social robots,


116
0:5:56,53 --> 0:5:59,95
that can actually recognize
gestures and can actually


117
0:5:59,95 --> 0:6:5,45
interact, all of which will be
put to the service of us.


118
0:6:5,45 --> 0:6:8,81
So when you think about this
from an art perspective and a


119
0:6:8,81 --> 0:6:13,13
culture perspective, it says
that these devices, which


120
0:6:13,13 --> 0:6:16,84
we're so incredibly excited
about, will be seen as so


121
0:6:16,84 --> 0:6:19,22
extraordinarily primitive.


122
0:6:19,22 --> 0:6:24,0
And that the ability to build
systems that interact, that


123
0:6:24,0 --> 0:6:27,2
help us, that monitor
us-- again because


124
0:6:27,2 --> 0:6:29,1
we want them to--


125
0:6:29,1 --> 0:6:32,316
will make a huge,
huge difference


126
0:6:32,316 --> 0:6:33,9
in everybody's lives.


127
0:6:33,9 --> 0:6:36,99
And the most exciting thing
about this is that in the


128
0:6:36,99 --> 0:6:43,17
spread of this, it happens not
just for us, the wealthy,


129
0:6:43,17 --> 0:6:44,84
developed world.


130
0:6:44,84 --> 0:6:48,51
But the same story at a
slower scale works in


131
0:6:48,51 --> 0:6:50,57
the developing world.


132
0:6:50,57 --> 0:6:53,26
So we sit there and we go, well,
we're really excited.


133
0:6:53,26 --> 0:6:54,22
We can use Google here.


134
0:6:54,22 --> 0:6:56,5
We can watch YouTube
and so forth.


135
0:6:56,5 --> 0:7:1,53
In a country with no schools,
no textbooks, and the only


136
0:7:1,53 --> 0:7:4,35
thing they have are these
devices, these devices are


137
0:7:4,35 --> 0:7:6,82
life-changing.


138
0:7:6,82 --> 0:7:10,2
And over the next three to
five years, the next five


139
0:7:10,2 --> 0:7:12,79
billion will get low-end
smartphones


140
0:7:12,79 --> 0:7:14,6
of one kind or another.


141
0:7:14,6 --> 0:7:19,23
It will finally enable them to
join our conversation, to get


142
0:7:19,23 --> 0:7:22,63
the benefits of the information,
the culture, the


143
0:7:22,63 --> 0:7:26,25
art, and all the things that you
all have worked so hard.


144
0:7:26,25 --> 0:7:29,64
It's extraordinary to imagine
all of the world now being


145
0:7:29,64 --> 0:7:32,95
able to participate at the state
of the art, at the level


146
0:7:32,95 --> 0:7:36,15
of technology that we're
talking about today.


147
0:7:36,15 --> 0:7:38,53
This is I think why we're so
excited about our partnerships


148
0:7:38,53 --> 0:7:41,5
with you all and why we're
putting so much money in this


149
0:7:41,5 --> 0:7:42,28
kind of stuff.


150
0:7:42,28 --> 0:7:45,78
I thought what I should do is
pause and perhaps ask people's


151
0:7:45,78 --> 0:7:49,14
comments or questions
as we begin


152
0:7:49,14 --> 0:7:50,64
the rest of the afternoon.


153
0:7:50,64 --> 0:7:52,77
Who would like to start with
questions or comments on this


154
0:7:52,77 --> 0:7:54,2
or on anything else?


155
0:7:54,2 --> 0:7:58,18



156
0:7:58,18 --> 0:8:0,316
In the back, go ahead,
yes sir.


157
0:8:0,316 --> 0:8:1,566
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]


158
0:8:1,566 --> 0:8:17,58



159
0:8:17,58 --> 0:8:20,46
what in the future the
individual's responsibility


160
0:8:20,46 --> 0:8:23,3
for themselves will
be or could be?


161
0:8:23,3 --> 0:8:26,8
And how does that change in
our relationship to larger


162
0:8:26,8 --> 0:8:28,195
corporations who would have
to run these systems?


163
0:8:28,195 --> 0:8:30,95



164
0:8:30,95 --> 0:8:33,21
MALE SPEAKER: Very
good question.


165
0:8:33,21 --> 0:8:36,78
The technology can be programmed
to be more of a


166
0:8:36,78 --> 0:8:39,799
nanny state or more of a
libertarian model, for


167
0:8:39,799 --> 0:8:43,429
purposes of discussion,
if you want to imagine


168
0:8:43,429 --> 0:8:45,44
the two most extremes.


169
0:8:45,44 --> 0:8:48,86
I believe societies will
ultimately choose somewhere


170
0:8:48,86 --> 0:8:51,54
along that arc.


171
0:8:51,54 --> 0:8:54,4
And I think societies will
choose different points based


172
0:8:54,4 --> 0:8:59,1
on culture, legal precedent,
sort of the way they run.


173
0:8:59,1 --> 0:9:3,21
Autocracies, for example, will
be much less interested in


174
0:9:3,21 --> 0:9:4,36
your personal freedom than a


175
0:9:4,36 --> 0:9:6,99
democracy, for obvious reasons.


176
0:9:6,99 --> 0:9:10,7
And there's lots of
evidence of that.


177
0:9:10,7 --> 0:9:12,18
That's the first observation.


178
0:9:12,18 --> 0:9:13,43
It will vary.


179
0:9:13,43 --> 0:9:16,16



180
0:9:16,16 --> 0:9:18,99
All of these systems, in my
view, will ultimately be


181
0:9:18,99 --> 0:9:23,27
designed around, the individual
has to opt in.


182
0:9:23,27 --> 0:9:26,93
It's simply too scary to imagine
these things being


183
0:9:26,93 --> 0:9:31,61
imposed on people, I argue and
I feel very strongly that in


184
0:9:31,61 --> 0:9:35,3
the hawks versus doves argument,
the hawks tend to


185
0:9:35,3 --> 0:9:39,86
win and there tends to be
a stripping of privacy.


186
0:9:39,86 --> 0:9:43,61
There tends to be a loss of
individual responsibility, if


187
0:9:43,61 --> 0:9:45,87
you will, the ability to
make your own choice.


188
0:9:45,87 --> 0:9:49,27
But I do think that societies
will make those decisions but


189
0:9:49,27 --> 0:9:51,51
in different levels.


190
0:9:51,51 --> 0:9:54,26
And the technology
will serve that.


191
0:9:54,26 --> 0:9:55,73
The second part of your question
was, what are the


192
0:9:55,73 --> 0:9:57,25
responsibilities of
global companies?


193
0:9:57,25 --> 0:10:0,43
We spend a lot of time at Google
thinking about this.


194
0:10:0,43 --> 0:10:3,82
And the conclusion we've come
to, is we have a set of


195
0:10:3,82 --> 0:10:5,92
principles that we believe
in to make the


196
0:10:5,92 --> 0:10:7,63
world a better place.


197
0:10:7,63 --> 0:10:11,72
And we will push them as hard
as we can up to the point


198
0:10:11,72 --> 0:10:14,75
where we're violating the laws
of the other country.


199
0:10:14,75 --> 0:10:17,93
So we will take a position--
when there's an ambiguity--


200
0:10:17,93 --> 0:10:20,72
for free expression, openness,
freedom of


201
0:10:20,72 --> 0:10:23,92
choice, we trust you.


202
0:10:23,92 --> 0:10:27,59
When it comes to literally
violating the law of the other


203
0:10:27,59 --> 0:10:32,35
country, then we're forced to
back away, sometimes in our


204
0:10:32,35 --> 0:10:35,89
view for the wrong reasons.


205
0:10:35,89 --> 0:10:38,69
Most global companies
will come to that.


206
0:10:38,69 --> 0:10:40,47
Our attitude is seen in many


207
0:10:40,47 --> 0:10:43,65
countries is American hegemony.


208
0:10:43,65 --> 0:10:45,79
It's important to understand
that my message, which plays


209
0:10:45,79 --> 0:10:47,62
well in the US, does not
necessarily play


210
0:10:47,62 --> 0:10:50,71
well in other countries.


211
0:10:50,71 --> 0:10:51,53
More questions?


212
0:10:51,53 --> 0:10:52,78
Yes, yes, ma'am.


213
0:10:52,78 --> 0:11:1,47



214
0:11:1,47 --> 0:11:2,96
AUDIENCE: What I brought
up before about market


215
0:11:2,96 --> 0:11:7,96
saturation, I'd like to hear
your thoughts on making the


216
0:11:7,96 --> 0:11:12,29
availability of any kind of a
creative work, whether it's a


217
0:11:12,29 --> 0:11:17,97
newspaper, a work of art, but
making it available so broadly


218
0:11:17,97 --> 0:11:23,34
that it therefore saturates a
market, which tends to push


219
0:11:23,34 --> 0:11:25,8
pricing down.


220
0:11:25,8 --> 0:11:32,4
Which tends to then support
industries as a whole but not


221
0:11:32,4 --> 0:11:36,54
the smaller company, not
the smaller individual.


222
0:11:36,54 --> 0:11:39,3
And is that where we're going?


223
0:11:39,3 --> 0:11:42,8
Where it becomes almost like the
old motion picture studio


224
0:11:42,8 --> 0:11:44,52
model for all creative works?


225
0:11:44,52 --> 0:11:47,9
And that that's the only way
to make money is if the


226
0:11:47,9 --> 0:11:50,17
companies own all of this,
because of this market


227
0:11:50,17 --> 0:11:51,8
saturation.


228
0:11:51,8 --> 0:11:52,99
MALE SPEAKER: I agree with the
first half of your question


229
0:11:52,99 --> 0:11:55,4
and not the conclusion.


230
0:11:55,4 --> 0:11:58,5
So the rough analysis of what's
going on is that we


231
0:11:58,5 --> 0:12:2,24
went from an era of scarcity
to an era of abundance.


232
0:12:2,24 --> 0:12:5,87
That the distribution models
of the past were largely


233
0:12:5,87 --> 0:12:9,32
limited by physical constraints,
the difficulty of


234
0:12:9,32 --> 0:12:12,32
copying et cetera, et cetera.


235
0:12:12,32 --> 0:12:14,24
So you had high cost of
distribution, high cost of


236
0:12:14,24 --> 0:12:15,38
manufacturing.


237
0:12:15,38 --> 0:12:17,83
In the digital world, you have
essentially no cost of


238
0:12:17,83 --> 0:12:20,49
distribution and no cost
of manufacturing.


239
0:12:20,49 --> 0:12:22,58
So you've gone from the
era of scarcity


240
0:12:22,58 --> 0:12:24,42
to the era of abundance.


241
0:12:24,42 --> 0:12:27,63
In an era of abundance, there
are many, many strategies to


242
0:12:27,63 --> 0:12:28,74
make money.


243
0:12:28,74 --> 0:12:32,25
Unfortunately, the people who
made the money in the era of


244
0:12:32,25 --> 0:12:35,52
scarcity often don't make the
transition to the next.


245
0:12:35,52 --> 0:12:38,58
They struggle for all
sorts of reasons.


246
0:12:38,58 --> 0:12:39,4
In the newspapers--


247
0:12:39,4 --> 0:12:41,59
which is an easy one
to understand--


248
0:12:41,59 --> 0:12:44,0
there are number of newspapers
that were formed that are new


249
0:12:44,0 --> 0:12:47,33
that are doing very well, that
adopted an advertising model


250
0:12:47,33 --> 0:12:49,3
as opposed to a subscription
model.


251
0:12:49,3 --> 0:12:52,81
The Politico and Huffington
Post, as to Huffington Post


252
0:12:52,81 --> 0:12:54,74
run out of here.


253
0:12:54,74 --> 0:12:58,59
And so those are some examples
of new ventures, new business


254
0:12:58,59 --> 0:13:1,93
models where they ditched
the old model.


255
0:13:1,93 --> 0:13:4,4
And it's fine to keep the old
model but the point is, it's a


256
0:13:4,4 --> 0:13:5,54
hybrid model.


257
0:13:5,54 --> 0:13:10,22
So it does not then follow that
all the content is owned


258
0:13:10,22 --> 0:13:12,18
by big companies.


259
0:13:12,18 --> 0:13:15,15
I think what it means is that
at each point in the value


260
0:13:15,15 --> 0:13:18,3
chain of distribution, you
have to come up with a


261
0:13:18,3 --> 0:13:20,9
strategy to build an audience
that will get you enough


262
0:13:20,9 --> 0:13:23,86
market that you can
monetize it.


263
0:13:23,86 --> 0:13:26,77
The old model of hey, I'm going
to restrict access to my


264
0:13:26,77 --> 0:13:30,33
content works if you have
something which you can get


265
0:13:30,33 --> 0:13:32,33
the subscription revenue for.


266
0:13:32,33 --> 0:13:34,71
It doesn't generally work in a
world where everything's so


267
0:13:34,71 --> 0:13:36,2
easily copyable.


268
0:13:36,2 --> 0:13:37,95
That's where we are.


269
0:13:37,95 --> 0:13:40,5
A lot of people are struggling
with this.


270
0:13:40,5 --> 0:13:42,14
We do have a lot of very
good examples now.


271
0:13:42,14 --> 0:13:46,56
If you look at YouTube,
classic example.


272
0:13:46,56 --> 0:13:50,7
The major studios took years to
get to the point where they


273
0:13:50,7 --> 0:13:52,81
were comfortable putting their
content on YouTube.


274
0:13:52,81 --> 0:13:55,45
And now we've pretty much got
partners with every single one


275
0:13:55,45 --> 0:13:56,8
of them and pretty much
every one of those


276
0:13:56,8 --> 0:13:58,29
deals making money.


277
0:13:58,29 --> 0:14:1,9
So we together with them figured
out a way to monetize


278
0:14:1,9 --> 0:14:2,63
that content in a new way.


279
0:14:2,63 --> 0:14:3,708
Just took a while.


280
0:14:3,708 --> 0:14:4,958
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]


281
0:14:4,958 --> 0:14:8,86



282
0:14:8,86 --> 0:14:10,3
MALE SPEAKER: The question is,
does it go to the companies


283
0:14:10,3 --> 0:14:12,76
rather than the individual
creators?


284
0:14:12,76 --> 0:14:16,69
The logic would be the inverse
because the networks should


285
0:14:16,69 --> 0:14:20,97
disintermediate the middle man
and the aggregate revenue


286
0:14:20,97 --> 0:14:25,7
should increase to the content
provider at the end state.


287
0:14:25,7 --> 0:14:27,26
So you may be seeing a
transition effect or you may


288
0:14:27,26 --> 0:14:30,46
be seeing some aspect of the
market doesn't make sense.


289
0:14:30,46 --> 0:14:31,54
But typically the internet


290
0:14:31,54 --> 0:14:33,88
disintermediates the middle people.


291
0:14:33,88 --> 0:14:36,87
And it forces the middle men
to become much more highly


292
0:14:36,87 --> 0:14:40,8
verticalized and specialized,
because sheer distribution is


293
0:14:40,8 --> 0:14:41,59
no longer an asset.


294
0:14:41,59 --> 0:14:44,27



295
0:14:44,27 --> 0:14:45,52
Yes, sir, go ahead.


296
0:14:45,52 --> 0:14:49,7



297
0:14:49,7 --> 0:14:50,95
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]


298
0:14:50,95 --> 0:14:53,6



299
0:14:53,6 --> 0:14:54,86
is the YouTube film which
is [INAUDIBLE]


300
0:14:54,86 --> 0:15:3,57



301
0:15:3,57 --> 0:15:6,18
MALE SPEAKER: This is not
the first time we've had


302
0:15:6,18 --> 0:15:8,48
controversial videos
on YouTube.


303
0:15:8,48 --> 0:15:12,72
Our team has reviewed this video
very, very carefully.


304
0:15:12,72 --> 0:15:15,36
It's well within the guidelines
that we established


305
0:15:15,36 --> 0:15:18,78
in 2008 for what would be
permissible on YouTube.


306
0:15:18,78 --> 0:15:20,27
And you can read them
on the site, so


307
0:15:20,27 --> 0:15:22,15
there's no secrets here.


308
0:15:22,15 --> 0:15:23,85
So it'll stay up.


309
0:15:23,85 --> 0:15:28,98
We have blocked it in a couple
of countries where the law


310
0:15:28,98 --> 0:15:31,25
does not allow it to be shown.


311
0:15:31,25 --> 0:15:34,34
And we have blocked it in two
other countries where we


312
0:15:34,34 --> 0:15:36,77
thought it was a matter
of public safety.


313
0:15:36,77 --> 0:15:40,45
We don't want to be associated
with this violence, of course.


314
0:15:40,45 --> 0:15:46,99
My personal view is that you
have internal strife.


315
0:15:46,99 --> 0:15:50,8
The vast majority of people who
seem to be engaged in this


316
0:15:50,8 --> 0:15:53,1
bad behavior have not
seen the video.


317
0:15:53,1 --> 0:15:57,3
They heard it through oral
reports and so forth.


318
0:15:57,3 --> 0:16:2,73
So to argue against keeping
the video up is to argue


319
0:16:2,73 --> 0:16:6,53
against core freedom of
expression argument.


320
0:16:6,53 --> 0:16:9,61
And I think all of us believe
in religious tolerance.


321
0:16:9,61 --> 0:16:11,88
And that includes religious
criticism.


322
0:16:11,88 --> 0:16:13,93
And you'll see that
our policies.


323
0:16:13,93 --> 0:16:17,27
So we've made the decision
to keep it up.


324
0:16:17,27 --> 0:16:20,7
We obviously do not endorse
any of those actions or


325
0:16:20,7 --> 0:16:22,77
violence that have
consequences.


326
0:16:22,77 --> 0:16:26,47
And frankly, I think, this is
going to happen again in other


327
0:16:26,47 --> 0:16:30,3
forms, consequence of
the connected world.


328
0:16:30,3 --> 0:16:32,335
The alternative is to shut
off the internet, which


329
0:16:32,335 --> 0:16:35,2
[? you're ?] not going to do.


330
0:16:35,2 --> 0:16:38,86
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about what the


331
0:16:38,86 --> 0:16:40,28
gentleman was saying.


332
0:16:40,28 --> 0:16:43,925
You said at some point doctor
will call you, you don't need


333
0:16:43,925 --> 0:16:45,36
to call the doctor.


334
0:16:45,36 --> 0:16:47,83
Let's assume in a country where
it's illegal to be gay.


335
0:16:47,83 --> 0:16:48,9
You have AIDS.


336
0:16:48,9 --> 0:16:50,64
Do you want your doctor
to call you?


337
0:16:50,64 --> 0:16:53,1
MALE SPEAKER: This is why I said
earlier it's incredibly


338
0:16:53,1 --> 0:16:56,65
important that these systems
be user choice.


339
0:16:56,65 --> 0:17:0,64
So if you were aware that you're
potentially eligible


340
0:17:0,64 --> 0:17:3,32
for some health disease which
is illegal in your crazy and


341
0:17:3,32 --> 0:17:4,75
stupid country.


342
0:17:4,75 --> 0:17:6,69
Right?


343
0:17:6,69 --> 0:17:8,75
If you find yourself stuck in
the world's worst country


344
0:17:8,75 --> 0:17:11,68
which would do that, obviously
it's a terrible situation.


345
0:17:11,68 --> 0:17:16,91
You would appropriately decide
not to expose yourself to this


346
0:17:16,91 --> 0:17:18,829
possible risk.


347
0:17:18,829 --> 0:17:22,55
There is an issue here that
these systems tend naturally


348
0:17:22,55 --> 0:17:25,16
to be connected and naturally
have tracking capabilities


349
0:17:25,16 --> 0:17:27,89
just because of the
way they're built.


350
0:17:27,89 --> 0:17:30,64
So that's why opt-in, people can
turn them on and off, and


351
0:17:30,64 --> 0:17:31,895
user buy-in are very
important.


352
0:17:31,895 --> 0:17:34,47



353
0:17:34,47 --> 0:17:35,27
One more, yes?


354
0:17:35,27 --> 0:17:36,205
The one there.


355
0:17:36,205 --> 0:17:36,58
Yes.


356
0:17:36,58 --> 0:17:38,19
Over here or here.


357
0:17:38,19 --> 0:17:38,33
Go ahead.


358
0:17:38,33 --> 0:17:40,1
It doesn't matter.


359
0:17:40,1 --> 0:17:42,42
Yes. sir.


360
0:17:42,42 --> 0:17:47,74
AUDIENCE: We've had experience
in the age of the internet of


361
0:17:47,74 --> 0:17:49,91
material not being available
anymore and


362
0:17:49,91 --> 0:17:51,95
storage systems change.


363
0:17:51,95 --> 0:17:56,13
And there are constant upgrades
move faster and


364
0:17:56,13 --> 0:17:58,86
faster and faster, especially
with mobile.


365
0:17:58,86 --> 0:18:2,42
So that eventually people have
to recognize a day may come


366
0:18:2,42 --> 0:18:8,8
when oh, my photographs, my
music, my texts, my novel,


367
0:18:8,8 --> 0:18:9,86
they disappeared.


368
0:18:9,86 --> 0:18:10,72
Where are they?


369
0:18:10,72 --> 0:18:14,701
I think if Ray Bradbury were
writing 451 in this day and


370
0:18:14,701 --> 0:18:16,25
age, it wouldn't be about
burning books.


371
0:18:16,25 --> 0:18:18,81
It would be about pushing a
button on a computer somewhere


372
0:18:18,81 --> 0:18:21,86
and they would all just
digitally disappear.


373
0:18:21,86 --> 0:18:25,47
As our technology progresses,
how do we know that we're


374
0:18:25,47 --> 0:18:29,22
going to be able to retain that
from the past as a new


375
0:18:29,22 --> 0:18:33,51
storage system comes
into being?


376
0:18:33,51 --> 0:18:34,2
MALE SPEAKER: There
are whole teams


377
0:18:34,2 --> 0:18:35,6
looking at this question.


378
0:18:35,6 --> 0:18:38,89
This is known as the digital
archival question.


379
0:18:38,89 --> 0:18:42,51
I'm not as worried about this
because the systems that


380
0:18:42,51 --> 0:18:46,24
Google and others are building
tend to preserve everything in


381
0:18:46,24 --> 0:18:49,4
a format that is presentable.


382
0:18:49,4 --> 0:18:52,31
Eventually, I think your
argument is correct.


383
0:18:52,31 --> 0:18:55,68
But, for example, the ubiquity
of jpegs and photographs,


384
0:18:55,68 --> 0:18:59,75
there will always, 100 years
from now, be a converter from


385
0:18:59,75 --> 0:19:2,54
that jpeg format to
whatever exists.


386
0:19:2,54 --> 0:19:3,68
There's simply too much.


387
0:19:3,68 --> 0:19:5,62
There's too many.


388
0:19:5,62 --> 0:19:7,31
I don't worry about this
issue for things


389
0:19:7,31 --> 0:19:9,16
which are highly common.


390
0:19:9,16 --> 0:19:12,51
I do think that if you have a
very specialized format, there


391
0:19:12,51 --> 0:19:15,27
really is danger
of losing that.


392
0:19:15,27 --> 0:19:18,22
And so if you're using the
very standardized data


393
0:19:18,22 --> 0:19:21,16
representation formats, you'll
probably be fine.


394
0:19:21,16 --> 0:19:22,97
And for the specialized stuff,
there are people trying to


395
0:19:22,97 --> 0:19:25,22
figure out archivally keep
this, things like the


396
0:19:25,22 --> 0:19:27,62
Smithsonian and things
like that.


397
0:19:27,62 --> 0:19:31,39
But your your safety in terms of
preservation is to use the


398
0:19:31,39 --> 0:19:33,11
most common formats.


399
0:19:33,11 --> 0:19:35,8
YouTube's not going to go away,
as an example, Uses


400
0:19:35,8 --> 0:19:38,74
common formats.


401
0:19:38,74 --> 0:19:39,2
Yes.


402
0:19:39,2 --> 0:19:39,81
There was a question over here.


403
0:19:39,81 --> 0:19:40,73
Yes.


404
0:19:40,73 --> 0:19:42,23
Yes, sir.


405
0:19:42,23 --> 0:19:46,3
AUDIENCE: I just wanted to ask
you about search and curation.


406
0:19:46,3 --> 0:19:49,1
You talked about five billion
more people entering this


407
0:19:49,1 --> 0:19:49,74
conversation.


408
0:19:49,74 --> 0:19:52,55
It seems like two things
sort of happen.


409
0:19:52,55 --> 0:19:55,93
One, we all go into an echo
chamber and we find the things


410
0:19:55,93 --> 0:20:0,26
we find over and over again
versus being given things.


411
0:20:0,26 --> 0:20:2,62
As the conversation increases,
how are we going to find the


412
0:20:2,62 --> 0:20:4,785
things that are really
important to us?


413
0:20:4,785 --> 0:20:7,34
MALE SPEAKER: There's been a lot
of people who worried that


414
0:20:7,34 --> 0:20:10,99
the nature of the selection bias
and the systems that are


415
0:20:10,99 --> 0:20:14,42
being built will ultimately
produce narrow echo chambers


416
0:20:14,42 --> 0:20:18,38
where we only hear ourselves and
our friends and so forth.


417
0:20:18,38 --> 0:20:22,2
This has been measured and so
far it's completely not true.


418
0:20:22,2 --> 0:20:28,57
So far, we've managed to escape
the outcome of lack of


419
0:20:28,57 --> 0:20:30,9
criticality.


420
0:20:30,9 --> 0:20:34,16
And I personally believe that
as more voices come in, it's


421
0:20:34,16 --> 0:20:37,52
good from a standpoint
of more choices.


422
0:20:37,52 --> 0:20:39,96
We would argue that this
is a ranking problem.


423
0:20:39,96 --> 0:20:42,29
How do you-- with all these new
voices-- how do you rank


424
0:20:42,29 --> 0:20:44,11
those voices compared
to others?


425
0:20:44,11 --> 0:20:45,65
We're in the business
of ranking.


426
0:20:45,65 --> 0:20:48,26
It's not perfect but we
do the best we can.


427
0:20:48,26 --> 0:20:49,75
We have time for
a couple more.


428
0:20:49,75 --> 0:20:51,38
Yes, yes.


429
0:20:51,38 --> 0:20:52,1
AUDIENCE: Good afternoon.


430
0:20:52,1 --> 0:20:55,55
I want to follow up on your
disintermediation point and


431
0:20:55,55 --> 0:21:0,12
ask if you might envision the
technologies that Google


432
0:21:0,12 --> 0:21:3,46
facilitates development of
as an ultimate disruptor,


433
0:21:3,46 --> 0:21:6,63
possibly eventually
disintermediating the need for


434
0:21:6,63 --> 0:21:9,14
the real estate that cinemas
offer for alternate content?


435
0:21:9,14 --> 0:21:13,67
And that possibly opening up
the abilities for a greater


436
0:21:13,67 --> 0:21:16,56
amount of this artistic
alternative content to find


437
0:21:16,56 --> 0:21:17,47
its way there?


438
0:21:17,47 --> 0:21:18,4
MALE SPEAKER: I--


439
0:21:18,4 --> 0:21:20,8
AUDIENCE: Three points
to it, just quickly.


440
0:21:20,8 --> 0:21:23,25
If the [? end cinema ?] is
big, democratized in it's


441
0:21:23,25 --> 0:21:26,45
offering and community, can
not those three things and


442
0:21:26,45 --> 0:21:28,72
more be offered online?


443
0:21:28,72 --> 0:21:31,4
AUDIENCE: I have a very strong
opinion on movie theaters.


444
0:21:31,4 --> 0:21:33,9
I think that they're incredibly
important because


445
0:21:33,9 --> 0:21:35,6
they're the only places
that people turn off


446
0:21:35,6 --> 0:21:36,11
their mobile devices.


447
0:21:36,11 --> 0:21:38,85
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]


448
0:21:38,85 --> 0:21:39,87
MALE SPEAKER: No, no
think about it.


449
0:21:39,87 --> 0:21:43,55
Is there any other place
in the world?


450
0:21:43,55 --> 0:21:46,46
You keep it on when you're
asleep but not when you're in


451
0:21:46,46 --> 0:21:48,4
the movie theater.


452
0:21:48,4 --> 0:21:50,98
This is landmark status.


453
0:21:50,98 --> 0:21:55,45
[AUDIENCE LAUGHTER]


454
0:21:55,45 --> 0:21:57,14
MALE SPEAKER: I think going
to the movies is a social


455
0:21:57,14 --> 0:21:59,81
experience, the sense of
going to the opening.


456
0:21:59,81 --> 0:22:1,42
that's not going to go away.


457
0:22:1,42 --> 0:22:4,49
And so I think the movie folks
all believe that you're seeing


458
0:22:4,49 --> 0:22:6,9
a compression of windows.


459
0:22:6,9 --> 0:22:9,81
But I think the model will
preserve at least the notion


460
0:22:9,81 --> 0:22:11,14
of opening night.


461
0:22:11,14 --> 0:22:12,53
People want to feel special.


462
0:22:12,53 --> 0:22:14,39
It goes back to the question
earlier about scarcity.


463
0:22:14,39 --> 0:22:17,55



464
0:22:17,55 --> 0:22:20,15
Very clever marketeers
understand that if they make


465
0:22:20,15 --> 0:22:23,97
slightly fewer of a product
and there is demand, it


466
0:22:23,97 --> 0:22:26,18
creates excessive lines.


467
0:22:26,18 --> 0:22:29,51
That's what happens in the
clubs around here.


468
0:22:29,51 --> 0:22:31,44
The most popular club is defined
as the one with the


469
0:22:31,44 --> 0:22:33,735
longest line, not the
greatest capacity.


470
0:22:33,735 --> 0:22:39,71



471
0:22:39,71 --> 0:22:41,26
We have one final question.


472
0:22:41,26 --> 0:22:41,98
Right over here.


473
0:22:41,98 --> 0:22:43,23
Yes.


474
0:22:43,23 --> 0:22:47,5



475
0:22:47,5 --> 0:22:50,45
AUDIENCE: How do you go about
educating entire populaces


476
0:22:50,45 --> 0:22:53,75
about the ins and outs of opting
in, when they should do


477
0:22:53,75 --> 0:22:57,72
it, how they should do it, when
they shouldn't do it.


478
0:22:57,72 --> 0:22:59,91
MALE SPEAKER: First that you
start with an awful lot of


479
0:22:59,91 --> 0:23:1,64
information that's online.


480
0:23:1,64 --> 0:23:4,24
And you try to make it readable
in people's language


481
0:23:4,24 --> 0:23:6,92
and they can understand it.


482
0:23:6,92 --> 0:23:11,42
Most people are confused by
what's happening because


483
0:23:11,42 --> 0:23:12,45
they're not computer
scientists.


484
0:23:12,45 --> 0:23:14,93
They don't really understand
how this stuff can be used.


485
0:23:14,93 --> 0:23:19,22
So we've tried very
hard to do that.


486
0:23:19,22 --> 0:23:22,76
I think the reality is that
education in general is going


487
0:23:22,76 --> 0:23:26,0
to change a big deal around
the world because you no


488
0:23:26,0 --> 0:23:28,69
longer need to memorize
all the stuff.


489
0:23:28,69 --> 0:23:32,3
Now you need to have a
significant education in being


490
0:23:32,3 --> 0:23:34,5
an online citizen.


491
0:23:34,5 --> 0:23:36,68
As a young person, what does
it mean to be a tweeter?


492
0:23:36,68 --> 0:23:39,21
What does it mean
to be texting?


493
0:23:39,21 --> 0:23:41,32
So, for example, all these
high school students are


494
0:23:41,32 --> 0:23:43,31
probably going to be rather
surprised to discover all


495
0:23:43,31 --> 0:23:46,88
those pictures are still
around when they're 45.


496
0:23:46,88 --> 0:23:49,25
And nobody told them that or
if their parents told them


497
0:23:49,25 --> 0:23:50,48
that, they discounted it.


498
0:23:50,48 --> 0:23:52,85
But if their teachers tell them,
maybe they will listen.


499
0:23:52,85 --> 0:23:54,84
I think there's a whole
series of steps that


500
0:23:54,84 --> 0:23:56,45
society will go through.


501
0:23:56,45 --> 0:23:59,17
What I will tell you is that
the shift from the analog


502
0:23:59,17 --> 0:24:2,16
world to the digital world that
we're going through--


503
0:24:2,16 --> 0:24:4,33
we're not going back.


504
0:24:4,33 --> 0:24:5,89
We need to get organized
around how we're


505
0:24:5,89 --> 0:24:7,4
going to run society--


506
0:24:7,4 --> 0:24:11,85
respectfully, with appropriate
levels of privacy, respecting


507
0:24:11,85 --> 0:24:15,52
the rights of public safety,
and sort that out.


508
0:24:15,52 --> 0:24:18,95
Countries will make those
decisions differently.


509
0:24:18,95 --> 0:24:22,43
And this will be a constant
discussion in the media.


510
0:24:22,43 --> 0:24:26,31
And that's how the education
really occurs.


511
0:24:26,31 --> 0:24:27,85
So with that, Peter,
thank you.


512
0:24:27,85 --> 0:24:28,6
Thank you very much.


513
0:24:28,6 --> 0:24:30,1
Thank you all.


514
0:24:30,1 --> 0:24:31,35
And we'll continue.


515
0:24:31,35 --> 0:26:31,35
