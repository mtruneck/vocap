0:0:17,52 --> 0:0:38,69
In 


2
0:0:38,69 --> 0:0:58,35
the 


3
0:0:58,35 --> 0:1:6,53
last lecture we had looked at some of the
issues in the location of facilities and we


4
0:1:6,53 --> 0:1:14,22
had got a broad overview of the problem of
location of different types of facilities.


5
0:1:14,22 --> 0:1:19,3
In this particular lecture we are going to
be talking about some mathematical models


6
0:1:19,3 --> 0:1:32,36
for facility location. In fact before we take
up any mathematical models we initiate the


7
0:1:32,36 --> 0:1:32,83
discussion.


8
0:1:32,83 --> 0:1:42,33
I will discuss the case study. This case study
is actually based on paper that Prof. Prem


9
0:1:42,33 --> 0:1:48,19
Vrat and I wrote and this is the reference.
It is called a decision model for a multi


10
0:1:48,19 --> 0:1:56,61
objective plant location problem and the basic
intention in this particular case study is


11
0:1:56,61 --> 0:2:4,66
to look at various factors which are relevant
for the plant location problem and try to


12
0:2:4,66 --> 0:2:13,42
then determine after conducting a feasibility
study as to what should be the best location


13
0:2:13,42 --> 0:2:20,36
for the manufacturing plant. So this would
be the kind of study that any new entrepreneur


14
0:2:20,36 --> 0:2:31,2
or any new company contemplating a new location
for a manufacturing plant would go through.


15
0:2:31,2 --> 0:2:38,11
In this particular case study the objective
of the location was actually to setup a straw


16
0:2:38,11 --> 0:2:48,72
board plant. Straw board as you know is a
packaging material which is made from industrial


17
0:2:48,72 --> 0:2:58,44
waste and basically the idea was that this
would be setup in an industrial setting so


18
0:2:58,44 --> 0:3:5,71
that there would be availability of industrial
waste automatically and that particular industrial


19
0:3:5,71 --> 0:3:14,41
waste would serve as the input for the plant
and this would then be processed to supply


20
0:3:14,41 --> 0:3:19,37
various industries needing packaging material
in the form of cottons and so on and various


21
0:3:19,37 --> 0:3:30,79
things. This was the basic idea behind the
location of this particular plant. Now what


22
0:3:30,79 --> 0:3:40,4
was actually done was that in order to conduct
this study systematically, interviews were


23
0:3:40,4 --> 0:3:48,26
carried out with the plant managers and various
other people in the organization to identify


24
0:3:48,26 --> 0:3:55,49
what were the various factors that they consider
important for this particular decision.


25
0:3:55,49 --> 0:4:4,8
After series of discussion with the management
it was found that the factors that needed


26
0:4:4,8 --> 0:4:13,61
to be considered are A nearness to raw material
source. Obviously the nearer you are to the


27
0:4:13,61 --> 0:4:19,69
raw material source, it would cut down the
cost of transportation and it is also easy


28
0:4:19,69 --> 0:4:26,569
to get your raw materials. Second factor that
was considered important was the availability


29
0:4:26,569 --> 0:4:35,9
and dependability of power. Then the manager
identifies transport facility as an important


30
0:4:35,9 --> 0:4:44,36
factor. Labor supply was another important
factor, employee facilities, the kinds of


31
0:4:44,36 --> 0:4:52,449
facility that employees will have in terms
of shopping recreation schools etc. This was


32
0:4:52,449 --> 0:4:57,539
considered to be a factor in the beginning.
Competition for the market was considered


33
0:4:57,539 --> 0:5:3,33
to be another major factor because if they
were already a large number of manufactures


34
0:5:3,33 --> 0:5:9,86
of straw board in that particular area it
would be difficult to sell your product. So


35
0:5:9,86 --> 0:5:15,3
the lesser the competition for the market,
the better it was. Proximity to market was


36
0:5:15,3 --> 0:5:22,909
considered another important factor. Government
incentives, as we know, typically the government


37
0:5:22,909 --> 0:5:29,3
might want to give certain kinds of incentives
for certain locations may be to encourage


38
0:5:29,3 --> 0:5:37,669
development of certain backward areas. These
are the kinds of incentives that are available


39
0:5:37,669 --> 0:5:42,789
and then finally the cost of land in that
particular site which we are considering.


40
0:5:42,789 --> 0:5:48,3
In fact you see these factors are almost generic
in any plant location problem. You would have


41
0:5:48,3 --> 0:5:54,4
to consider various factors. The only thing
that would happen is the relative importance


42
0:5:54,4 --> 0:6:0,65
you might give in these factors. They could
vary depending up on the nature of the plant.


43
0:6:0,65 --> 0:6:7,99
Our approach in the problem is essentially
something very simple and it is summarized


44
0:6:7,99 --> 0:6:9,169
in the form of this table.


45
0:6:9,169 --> 0:6:19,469
What you would like to do is we have identified
the objectives that we have. You would like


46
0:6:19,469 --> 0:6:27,389
to prioritize these objectives and give certain
weights and then we identify alternative locations


47
0:6:27,389 --> 0:6:38,279
A1, A2 and up to Am and each alternative location
is evaluated on the corresponding objective.


48
0:6:38,279 --> 0:6:45,539
For instance P11 is the score given to the
first alternative on the objective, P12 is


49
0:6:45,539 --> 0:6:52,479
the score given to the first alternative on
the second objective and so on. So if we can


50
0:6:52,479 --> 0:6:59,259
then get these scores, somehow then what we
simply have to do is we can calculate the


51
0:6:59,259 --> 0:7:7,27
effectiveness of alternative A1, alternative
A2, alternative Em if there are m alternatives


52
0:7:7,27 --> 0:7:15,219
we and get a kind of a score. This is very
similar to the manner in which we evaluate


53
0:7:15,219 --> 0:7:20,839
students in a class. These are the candidate
location of the candidates (Refer Slide Time:


54
0:7:20,839 --> 0:7:27,189
07:19), and these are the performances in
various subjects as you go through. Each subject


55
0:7:27,189 --> 0:7:32,189
has different weightage or different number
of credits and what we assign basically to


56
0:7:32,189 --> 0:7:40,77
you is some kind of marks based on some scheme
and ultimately you calculate a CGPA or a grade


57
0:7:40,77 --> 0:7:46,59
point average. So what we are trying to say
here is that, we use this kind of a scheme


58
0:7:46,59 --> 0:7:52,71
to evaluate different alternative locations.
Now let us see how it can be done.


59
0:7:52,71 --> 0:8:1,99
Earlier however we do what would be necessary
are the various objectives that we have, the


60
0:8:1,99 --> 0:8:5,589
objective that we just listed out nearest
to the raw material source availability and


61
0:8:5,589 --> 0:8:10,879
dependability of powers and so on. You have
to score these objectives to determine the


62
0:8:10,879 --> 0:8:17,409
weights, so what is actually being suggested
here is that if you construct a triangular


63
0:8:17,409 --> 0:8:21,61
matrix, the purpose of triangular matrix is
because there are n objectives. There will


64
0:8:21,61 --> 0:8:26,949
be nC2 possible comparisons or pair wise comparisons.
All pair wise comparisons. So we look for


65
0:8:26,949 --> 0:8:33,26
pair wise comparisons, for instance in comparing
objective 1 with objective 3. You might want


66
0:8:33,26 --> 0:8:41,13
to give o1, two marks whatever the interpretation
is; to these marks. Then ultimately you can


67
0:8:41,13 --> 0:8:49,96
determine the scores by counting the number
of scores or votes polled by different objectives.


68
0:8:49,96 --> 0:8:55,7
So you will able to get scores. The basic
advantage of scheme like this is when you


69
0:8:55,7 --> 0:9:1,6
have a large number of objectives; it is very
difficult to give weights to the individual


70
0:9:1,6 --> 0:9:7,24
objectives. But if you are comparing only
2 at a time, it is much easy for a person


71
0:9:7,24 --> 0:9:12,72
or a manager to say between o1 and o3; I can
compare and say o1 is more important. The


72
0:9:12,72 --> 0:9:21,3
difference is medium. So it is much easier
to adopt a pair wise comparison approach and


73
0:9:21,3 --> 0:9:24,34
evolve a set of scores.


74
0:9:24,34 --> 0:9:34,74
For instance for this particular problem what
was done was this triangular matrix was constructed


75
0:9:34,74 --> 0:9:47,32
and these were the objectives A, B, C, D,
E, F, G, H, I. The management was asked to


76
0:9:47,32 --> 0:9:54,5
compare between A and B and the management
felt that A was more important and the difference


77
0:9:54,5 --> 0:10:2,21
was medium. So you wrote A2 here. Similarly
in comparing for instance C and G, the management


78
0:10:2,21 --> 0:10:12,45
felt that G was more important, but the difference
was minor. So you put minor. This is because


79
0:10:12,45 --> 0:10:19,45
you are basically distinguishing between (Refer
Slide Time: 10:17) and then you say how much


80
0:10:19,45 --> 0:10:29,21
better, so this is a simple way of doing it.
So having got this information we can simply


81
0:10:29,21 --> 0:10:35,53
compute, for instance total A, you can count
the rows in this particular row. For B it


82
0:10:35,53 --> 0:10:41,56
can be in this column and this row for C,
you can count the votes here and so on. So


83
0:10:41,56 --> 0:10:51,65
you would know exactly what is the score or
the weightage for each of these various objectives.


84
0:10:51,65 --> 0:10:57,87
So in this particular example we have these
objectives A B C D E F G H I which were nearness


85
0:10:57,87 --> 0:11:4,47
to raw materials source availability and dependability
of power, transport, facilities etc and the


86
0:11:4,47 --> 0:11:13,76
total weightage given to these particular
factors came out from their as 16, 4, 6, 3,


87
0:11:13,76 --> 0:11:27,6
0, 14, 8, 12, 8, 7, and this was what was
basically involved here and the weightage


88
0:11:27,6 --> 0:11:33,98
for all these the percentage weightage you
sum it up this seems to be an error here sum


89
0:11:33,98 --> 0:11:42,82
it up and then divide this by the total you
get 23.0 percent weightage given to this particular


90
0:11:42,82 --> 0:11:47,95
factor here and so on similarly so hundred
percent weightage this is how it is finally


91
0:11:47,95 --> 0:11:56,83
distributed to these individual objectives.
So this was the rational way of arriving at


92
0:11:56,83 --> 0:12:4,26
these weightages, basically using pair wise
comparisons. There are a number of techniques


93
0:12:4,26 --> 0:12:11,94
available these days which you can employ
if you so desire. AHP is one example. Analytic


94
0:12:11,94 --> 0:12:16,8
hierarchy process is also pair wise comparison
technique which essentially gives you these


95
0:12:16,8 --> 0:12:22,35
weights and so on. But you have to go through
a similar kind of an exercise.


96
0:12:22,35 --> 0:12:31,55
So ultimately the results for this problem
could be classified as the above. A survey


97
0:12:31,55 --> 0:12:38,11
was conducted as to where the location should
be. Now the management in this case was interested


98
0:12:38,11 --> 0:12:43,62
that the location of the plant should be anywhere
in north India. We did not want to go to South


99
0:12:43,62 --> 0:12:52,93
or West so the major industrial districts
in the north were considered and these districts


100
0:12:52,93 --> 0:13:1,84
Panipat, Sonepat, Rohtak, Meerut, Faridabad,
Gurgaon, and Ghaziabad. These were the tentative


101
0:13:1,84 --> 0:13:10,42
locations that were possible for setting up
the plant and now we have these objectives


102
0:13:10,42 --> 0:13:14,86
and these are the weightages that we have
discovered and just determined from the pair


103
0:13:14,86 --> 0:13:23,42
wise comparisons. Finally what we are required
to do is to evaluate each of these locations


104
0:13:23,42 --> 0:13:29,2
on these individual factors. If you recall
the analogy this is not very difficult, it


105
0:13:29,2 --> 0:13:34,7
is like saying if this subject is Physics
I have to give quizzes in Physics to determine


106
0:13:34,7 --> 0:13:39,29
the marks. I have to determine this factor
which I will find out and so on. What we are


107
0:13:39,29 --> 0:13:50,36
trying to say is that the first factor which
was essentially near to raw materials sources


108
0:13:50,36 --> 0:13:56,87
was found in this particular classification,
nearness to raw material source, Rohtak was


109
0:13:56,87 --> 0:13:57,85
the best.


110
0:13:57,85 --> 0:14:5,81
Hence, Rohtak got 100 points. The scheme was
the worst location which will be given 50


111
0:14:5,81 --> 0:14:10,36
points and the best location will be given
100 points. It is very much like trying to


112
0:14:10,36 --> 0:14:16,6
say that we normally do not fail candidates
in the IIT and therefore the worst fellow


113
0:14:16,6 --> 0:14:21,53
will get 50 marks. The best fellow will get
100 marks in the particular. So in comparing


114
0:14:21,53 --> 0:14:30,73
these, in terms of distance in the raw material
source, Rohtak was relatively raw at that


115
0:14:30,73 --> 0:14:37,66
time and plenty of raw materials were available
there and so on, so it was 100 which were


116
0:14:37,66 --> 0:14:44,43
the worst. Faridabad, Gurgaon and Ghaziabad
were all low in the hierarchy and Faridabad


117
0:14:44,43 --> 0:14:54,13
was the worst. Faridabad was the worst although
it is an industrial town. Whatever, there


118
0:14:54,13 --> 0:15:1,73
were already large number of industrial units
set up for the availability of raw materials.


119
0:15:1,73 --> 0:15:6,99
It was difficult, more difficult as compared
to other factors. So this was the scheme,


120
0:15:6,99 --> 0:15:15,92
this was on a normalized scale of 50 to 100.
Similarly all these evaluations were done


121
0:15:15,92 --> 0:15:22,27
on a normalized scale from 50 to 100. For
instance in the second objective it was felt


122
0:15:22,27 --> 0:15:33,87
that Sonepat was the best and Meerut and Gahziabad
were the worst. For instance the third factor


123
0:15:33,87 --> 0:15:40,27
was transport facilities. As far as transport
facilities were concerned, it was Panipat


124
0:15:40,27 --> 0:15:47,35
that was the best out of these options. It
got 100 points, Rohtak was petty good, Faridabad


125
0:15:47,35 --> 0:15:57,279
was petty good Gurgaon was bad and Ghaziabad
was okay. So this was basically an evaluation


126
0:15:57,279 --> 0:16:2,38
of these locations on all the factors.


127
0:16:2,38 --> 0:16:9,1
Once all these scores are available what we
can do is 90 into 0.23, 80 into 0.057 so on.


128
0:16:9,1 --> 0:16:18,31
The final points that you get here are 86.1
and similarly 85.98, 91.16, 75, 61, 71, 64


129
0:16:18,31 --> 0:16:30,16
etc. So from this analysis it emerged that
Rohtak was the best option out of these. Now


130
0:16:30,16 --> 0:16:35,7
however you find that this was a very good
option, no doubt but the second best option


131
0:16:35,7 --> 0:16:42,42
was petty close. This is 91 marks, this is
86 marks. So it is like trying to say that


132
0:16:42,42 --> 0:16:46,9
a company comes to recruit, you need not only
recruit the best candidate, but the second


133
0:16:46,9 --> 0:16:53,11
best, and the third best will also get jobs.
So in the same sense you find that here 91


134
0:16:53,11 --> 0:16:58,9
and then 86 will be petty close and then 85,
0.8 which is almost 86, so these are petty


135
0:16:58,9 --> 0:17:7,89
close. So you could do a more detailed comparison
between the first three. What this means is


136
0:17:7,89 --> 0:17:15,809
that Rohtak was best on one, two, three and
four. Out of these various objectives, Panipet


137
0:17:15,809 --> 0:17:22,9
was the best one on only two of these objectives.


138
0:17:22,9 --> 0:17:30,1
Let us see where Rohtak was worst. It was
worst on this particular factor i.e., 60 marks.


139
0:17:30,1 --> 0:17:36,25
But it was even worst on this factor and this
was likely to be better but then it was best.


140
0:17:36,25 --> 0:17:45,73
So on the whole it seems that Rohtak would
be the optimal location. So the optimal location


141
0:17:45,73 --> 0:17:51,85
was in fact suggested as Rohtak and the company
adopted this. After many years the feed back


142
0:17:51,85 --> 0:17:56,26
received from the company is that they are
very happy in Rohtak which means the decision


143
0:17:56,26 --> 0:18:1,35
that was taken more than 15 years ago was
probably the right decision for them in terms


144
0:18:1,35 --> 0:18:8,8
of whatever we did. Now having used the decision
matrix for alternative location, you could


145
0:18:8,8 --> 0:18:15,16
use this methodology for any real life situation.
You see the tricky part here is how do you


146
0:18:15,16 --> 0:18:18,72
assign these marks to these candidates?


147
0:18:18,72 --> 0:18:24,12
If a particular factor is let us say capital
cost, then the highest capital cost will be


148
0:18:24,12 --> 0:18:30,64
the most undesirable, least capital cost will
be the most desirable and so on. So the manner


149
0:18:30,64 --> 0:18:36,559
in which you assign these marks is basically
the process of normalization.


150
0:18:36,559 --> 0:18:44,63
Now what about normalization? What we mean
in normalization is that depending up on the


151
0:18:44,63 --> 0:18:50,84
objectives suppose our objective is capital
cost and we have investigated a number of


152
0:18:50,84 --> 0:18:57,74
different alternatives then in the alternatives
the one which is the highest in terms of capital


153
0:18:57,74 --> 0:19:4,76
cost should be given the least marks, i.e.,
is 20 the one which is the lowest should get


154
0:19:4,76 --> 0:19:12,4
the highest marks which is 80 and the most
convenient way to represent this relationship


155
0:19:12,4 --> 0:19:24,76
is a linear straight line or a normal straight
line. You might use a normalization curve


156
0:19:24,76 --> 0:19:30,77
of this kind or a teacher who is giving a
normalization curve of this kind. So this


157
0:19:30,77 --> 0:19:38,1
is exactly what normalization would mean.
It is not necessarily true that normalization


158
0:19:38,1 --> 0:19:47,17
would be linear. Take the same example of
the capital cost for instance we have something


159
0:19:47,17 --> 0:19:54,35
like this, the lowest capital cost is L and
the highest capital cost is H. The company


160
0:19:54,35 --> 0:20:0,21
might be indifferent for instance, lowest
cost might be 2 lakh or whatever and say upto


161
0:20:0,21 --> 0:20:3,99
3 lakh. The company says it does not make
much of a difference. You are indifferent


162
0:20:3,99 --> 0:20:11,15
between 2 and 3 lakhs. So you give 80 marks
to all of them who have done this particular


163
0:20:11,15 --> 0:20:19,309
factor and then from here it could be a straight
line, it could be a concave function or a


164
0:20:19,309 --> 0:20:27,16
convex function as the case may be. The difference
between the concave and convex function would


165
0:20:27,16 --> 0:20:36,28
be that in the convex function which you have
here, the drop is very steep in the beginning.


166
0:20:36,28 --> 0:20:41,3
Slope is highest here and it tends to fall
and the minimum slope is here. So it is like


167
0:20:41,3 --> 0:20:49,3
saying you are penalizing the candidate most.
That is capital cost. There is a fall in capital


168
0:20:49,3 --> 0:20:55,37
cost. You are penalizing here and relatively
at this point, the rate of penalty is decreasing.


169
0:20:55,37 --> 0:21:4,4
It is the reverse in the case of the other
function. Now what I am simply trying to emphasize


170
0:21:4,4 --> 0:21:10,51
here is if you give careful thought to normalization,
this is a very important strategic decision


171
0:21:10,51 --> 0:21:19,35
location and what is normalization? Normalization
curves represent your attitudes towards the


172
0:21:19,35 --> 0:21:22,64
particular object.


173
0:21:22,64 --> 0:21:29,98
For instance, if you have a factor like labor
attitude, you might want to classify labor


174
0:21:29,98 --> 0:21:37,39
attitude into three categories, bad, medium
and good. You might say rested where the labor


175
0:21:37,39 --> 0:21:46,86
is so restive. It is willing to pick up agenda
for every small provocation. So it is a restive


176
0:21:46,86 --> 0:21:53,39
labor. You have a satisfactory labor. The
labor is willing to be cooperative and you


177
0:21:53,39 --> 0:21:59,8
might have a cooperative labor which is willing
to do everything. Obviously this is the best.


178
0:21:59,8 --> 0:22:4,21
So you give maximum marks. Let us say 80,
between these you give 60 between these you


179
0:22:4,21 --> 0:22:9,17
give 20. So essentially the normalization
curve for such subjective factors will be


180
0:22:9,17 --> 0:22:14,82
a staircase function of this kind where you
can decide the length or the height of the


181
0:22:14,82 --> 0:22:25,54
stair in each case. It is not necessarily
true that the normalization curve is linear


182
0:22:25,54 --> 0:22:30,2
or be portions of linear functions.
(Refer Slide Time: 22:34)


183
0:22:30,2 --> 0:22:37,86
A normalization curve could also be nonlinear.
So a nonlinear function is Present, so this


184
0:22:37,86 --> 0:22:45,4
is the least desirable. This is the most desirable.
The most desirable aspect is given the maximum


185
0:22:45,4 --> 0:22:49,91
number of points. The least desirable is given
the least number of points and you can think


186
0:22:49,91 --> 0:22:56,69
of what would be the nature of this curve
for your case. So the point is that once we


187
0:22:56,69 --> 0:23:3,69
have developed the normalization curves for
individual objectives, this process becomes


188
0:23:3,69 --> 0:23:9,7
very objective. All that you need to do is
develop the weights for the objectives like


189
0:23:9,7 --> 0:23:14,53
we did through the triangular matrix, determine
the normalization curves and feed them to


190
0:23:14,53 --> 0:23:22,98
a computer and then feed the data corresponding
to individual alternatives locations into


191
0:23:22,98 --> 0:23:34,48
the program and then you can get the final
solution for various options. So the idea


192
0:23:34,48 --> 0:23:41,929
here was that we were dealing with the practical
plant location problem. Practical plant location


193
0:23:41,929 --> 0:23:48,44
problem has both subjective and objective
factors. We had here a mechanism to deal with


194
0:23:48,44 --> 0:23:55,679
both subjective and objective factors but
there was no attempt at optimization.


195
0:23:55,679 --> 0:24:1,9
What was the kind of problems that we were
considering? We looked through the feasibility


196
0:24:1,9 --> 0:24:7,44
report or identified a number of locations
and we were trying to choose the best location.


197
0:24:7,44 --> 0:24:13,26
So it was the problem of choosing the best
out of the available options. That is the


198
0:24:13,26 --> 0:24:17,62
kind of the problem that we were considering,
however in facility location we have certain


199
0:24:17,62 --> 0:24:25,309
mathematical models where the intention is
to determine the best or the ideal location


200
0:24:25,309 --> 0:24:33,299
and that particular ideal location can then
motivate you to locate your facilities wherever


201
0:24:33,299 --> 0:24:39,16
they are. Let us see the models and we looked
at some simple models, for facility location


202
0:24:39,16 --> 0:24:43,309
in this context.


203
0:24:43,309 --> 0:24:50,9
Let us talk about the problem which is known
in lecture as the single facility location


204
0:24:50,9 --> 0:24:56,2
problem. The single facility location problem
is essentially the problem where you want


205
0:24:56,2 --> 0:25:2,96
to locate one new facility and this problem
occurs very frequently in life. Here are some


206
0:25:2,96 --> 0:25:8,86
examples of what we call the single facility
location problem. For instance you want to


207
0:25:8,86 --> 0:25:14,73
determine the location of a new lathe in a
job shop and you already have 23 lathes. You


208
0:25:14,73 --> 0:25:18,88
bring in another lathe, the 24th one and you
are trying to find out where it should be


209
0:25:18,88 --> 0:25:22,71
located. It is a single facility location
problem because you are trying to find out


210
0:25:22,71 --> 0:25:29,99
the location. A tool crib in a factory is
the place where we have the workers taking


211
0:25:29,99 --> 0:25:32,84
their tools and deposit their tool every time.


212
0:25:32,84 --> 0:25:37,3
So it is a common facility for all workers.
You might want to find out what is the best


213
0:25:37,3 --> 0:25:42,809
location of the tool crib such that the total
travel distance of all these workers is minimized


214
0:25:42,809 --> 0:25:47,71
which means total time is minimized. This
means their productivity is maximized because


215
0:25:47,71 --> 0:25:52,99
they are wasting less time in computing, in
that sense you could talk about the location


216
0:25:52,99 --> 0:25:59,98
of a new warehouse for a company warehouse.
You could talk about the location of the hospital


217
0:25:59,98 --> 0:26:6,78
or a fire station or a police station. All
single you could talk about is the location


218
0:26:6,78 --> 0:26:13,2
of the new classroom building on a college
campus, single facility location problem,


219
0:26:13,2 --> 0:26:20,98
a new airfield for a number of bases and you
can talk about the component in an electrical


220
0:26:20,98 --> 0:26:32,179
network. You know electrical network these
days have a large number of electrical components


221
0:26:32,179 --> 0:26:37,48
put onto one board. Suppose it is decided
that you improve the design characteristics,


222
0:26:37,48 --> 0:26:43,75
you want to put an additional resistor somewhere.
Where should that additional resistor be and


223
0:26:43,75 --> 0:26:48,48
it is going to be connected to some of these
components. So you are trying to say where


224
0:26:48,48 --> 0:26:53,7
should I put up the additional resistor such
that the total length of the cable or the


225
0:26:53,7 --> 0:26:59,69
length of wire is minimized? This is again
a problem of a single facility location.


226
0:26:59,69 --> 0:27:7,59
You want to talk about installation of a new
appliance in a kitchen; this is again a single


227
0:27:7,59 --> 0:27:11,13
facility location problem. You want to find
out where copying machine should be placed


228
0:27:11,13 --> 0:27:18,15
in the library, assuming that in a library,
different readers from different locations


229
0:27:18,15 --> 0:27:24,77
may have statistical data on an average 20
percent of the users, from first floor and


230
0:27:24,77 --> 0:27:29,29
30 percent from this floor, come here for
this particular thing. So you can determine


231
0:27:29,29 --> 0:27:34,67
where the optimum location for the copying
machine should be or if there is a new component


232
0:27:34,67 --> 0:27:38,88
on a control panel you have a big switch here
Larson and Tubro switch here. It is huge one


233
0:27:38,88 --> 0:27:42,86
and we are trying to find out where new component
should be installed which also happens to


234
0:27:42,86 --> 0:27:48,11
be a single facility location problem. So
the single facility location problem is actually


235
0:27:48,11 --> 0:27:53,32
a problem, in fact that is why it is called
single facility. We are not talking about


236
0:27:53,32 --> 0:28:0,44
single plant location because when you recall,
when we were discussing the issues in locations


237
0:28:0,44 --> 0:28:7,86
were specified that often tend to speak in
terms of facilities and depending on whichever


238
0:28:7,86 --> 0:28:13,72
facility it is you have to determine the optimum
location.


239
0:28:13,72 --> 0:28:20,94
For this problem the statement mathematical
statement can be built up as follows: we say


240
0:28:20,94 --> 0:28:31,5
that we have m existing facilities at locations
P1, P2, Pm whose locations are a1b1, a2b2


241
0:28:31,5 --> 0:28:37,53
and so on up to am bm, so we know the location
of the m existing facilities and the new facility


242
0:28:37,53 --> 0:28:43,97
is to be located at some point X which is
x y. You want to determine this (Refer Slide


243
0:28:43,97 --> 0:28:48,11
Time: 28:44) and where it should be located.
The new facility, the other existing facilities


244
0:28:48,11 --> 0:28:53,78
are fixed that is their assumption and dX
Pi is an appropriately defined as the distance


245
0:28:53,78 --> 0:29:0,37
between X and Pi. X is the new facility you
want to locate and Pi is one of the existing


246
0:29:0,37 --> 0:29:6,299
facilities. So the distance between them can
be called as dX, Pi and this distance could


247
0:29:6,299 --> 0:29:7,96
be defined in various weights.


248
0:29:7,96 --> 0:29:12,86
It could be Euclidean distance which is a
straight line distance. It could be the Rectilinear


249
0:29:12,86 --> 0:29:18,169
distance which is the Manhattan distance between
these two points, it could be the square Euclidean


250
0:29:18,169 --> 0:29:24,32
distance, it could be what we call a generalized
distance or it could be a distance on a network.


251
0:29:24,32 --> 0:29:31,309
In fact this would define a variety of models
which are available even for the simple problem,


252
0:29:31,309 --> 0:29:37,11
the single facility location problem. What
is the objective of this exercise? The objective


253
0:29:37,11 --> 0:29:44,62
is to determine the location X for the new
facility so as to minimize transportation


254
0:29:44,62 --> 0:29:53,71
related costs, that is what you want to do
and what are these transportation cost related


255
0:29:53,71 --> 0:30:2,429
to? The transportations related to cost are
the sum from i = 1to n, the summation of wi


256
0:30:2,429 --> 0:30:10,69
into dX, Pi where wi is the weight associated
with the ith facility which is the product


257
0:30:10,69 --> 0:30:18,37
of the cost per unit distance and the expected
number of annual trips between X and Pi. If


258
0:30:18,37 --> 0:30:25,5
you recall our discussion of the varianon
frame where we had determined weights corresponding


259
0:30:25,5 --> 0:30:32,62
to each of the points, the interpretation
of wi is the same. It is a weightage given


260
0:30:32,62 --> 0:30:39,87
to the ith point. How important it is in terms
of the interactions that take place between


261
0:30:39,87 --> 0:30:45,69
new facility and that particular facility.
That is the objective function. This is general


262
0:30:45,69 --> 0:30:52,47
problem; a general statement of the problem
is this.


263
0:30:52,47 --> 0:30:59,76
So essentially if you look at the problem
in a graphical perspective what is really


264
0:30:59,76 --> 0:31:8,16
required is that we have points P1, P2, and
P3 and so on up to Pn or Pm. This is the case


265
0:31:8,16 --> 0:31:16,12
and it may be spread out. These are the existing
facilities. We are interested in finding out


266
0:31:16,12 --> 0:31:30,69
an optimum location X. This optimum location
X should be such that the total cost of movement


267
0:31:30,69 --> 0:31:37,9
between all these should be minimized. That
means what we are trying to say is that we


268
0:31:37,9 --> 0:31:47,87
are trying to minimize the total cost of travel
or transportation between the various facilities.


269
0:31:47,87 --> 0:31:55,13
There could be many examples which we can
construct for instance, if these facilities


270
0:31:55,13 --> 0:32:0,94
are hospitals in the city, let us say Delhi
has 10 hospitals, these are the 10 hospitals


271
0:32:0,94 --> 0:32:5,15
that you have in the city and the problem
is that you are trying to find out the location


272
0:32:5,15 --> 0:32:11,1
of a centralized blood bank facility. This
can be called upon by any hospital in case


273
0:32:11,1 --> 0:32:14,22
of emergency or whatever it is.


274
0:32:14,22 --> 0:32:19,88
So what we are trying to say is that we should
determine the location such that if you know


275
0:32:19,88 --> 0:32:26,919
roughly that during a particular day there
are roughly 5 trips, here 20 trips, here 10


276
0:32:26,919 --> 0:32:33,419
trips, here 10 trips, here 30, and so on which
you, from the past historical data use the


277
0:32:33,419 --> 0:32:41,73
information to determine the optimum location
of the new service facility. Similarly you


278
0:32:41,73 --> 0:32:48,76
might say for instance if I want to find out
the location of a hospital which will cater


279
0:32:48,76 --> 0:32:54,61
to the needs of different people in the localities
and these localities have these weights in


280
0:32:54,61 --> 0:33:1,59
terms of number of people falling sick. Let
us consider an order of magnitude proportional


281
0:33:1,59 --> 0:33:7,23
to population, assuming that all people are
subjected to same kind of health conditions.


282
0:33:7,23 --> 0:33:12,679
So if you do that then again the problem of
finding out the location of this hospital


283
0:33:12,679 --> 0:33:27,63
is basically a single facility location problem.
Now what we would like to do is first understand


284
0:33:27,63 --> 0:33:33,32
the various commonly used distances that we
talked about.


285
0:33:33,32 --> 0:33:41,419
For instance if the location of the new facility
is at X and the ith existing facility is located


286
0:33:41,419 --> 0:33:48,48
at the point Pi which has coordinates ai,
bi then the rectilinear distance between these


287
0:33:48,48 --> 0:33:54,7
2 points is actually this (Refer Slide Time:
33:52) distance. This distance and then this


288
0:33:54,7 --> 0:34:0,9
distance (Refer Slide Time: 33:54) and mathematically
the rectilinear distance will be represented


289
0:34:0,9 --> 0:34:13,379
by x – ai mod + y – bi mod. Now you must
understand that there are a large number of


290
0:34:13,379 --> 0:34:22,359
situations in real life where the rectilinear
distance would be an appropriate one to consider,


291
0:34:22,359 --> 0:34:30,82
for instance all movements within the factory
are generally rectilinear because in a factory


292
0:34:30,82 --> 0:34:38,98
on the shop floor you can typically move along
a set of perpendicular heights. So if a worker


293
0:34:38,98 --> 0:34:44,109
has to go from one place to the other he has
to take of the perpendicular route this way


294
0:34:44,109 --> 0:34:45,419
and then go this way.


295
0:34:45,419 --> 0:34:51,9
That is the rectilinear distance and therefore
if you are dealing with a problem of let us


296
0:34:51,9 --> 0:34:59,71
say machine location within a factory, or
you are talking about location of some other


297
0:34:59,71 --> 0:35:5,18
tool crib in a factory or if you are talking
about the location of a let us say even canteen


298
0:35:5,18 --> 0:35:12,5
within a factory. The distance measure that
you think that is most appropriate is a rectilinear


299
0:35:12,5 --> 0:35:18,47
distance measure and therefore this is a very
important distance measure especially in the


300
0:35:18,47 --> 0:35:29,71
context of location on the shop floor, locations
within the factory. Of course if you happen


301
0:35:29,71 --> 0:35:36,97
to travel to New York for instance the distances
are rectilinear that is why it is called Manhattan.


302
0:35:36,97 --> 0:35:42,4
What you have is you have a large number of
parallel streets and these are intersected


303
0:35:42,4 --> 0:35:48,2
by a number of other parallel streets and
all that you have therefore is the movement


304
0:35:48,2 --> 0:35:52,93
is always rectilinear and in fact that is
the word Manhattan and rectilinear comes from


305
0:35:52,93 --> 0:36:5,5
it. In our context Delhi would not be rectilinear.
If you go to Chandigarh for instance the movement


306
0:36:5,5 --> 0:36:11,56
from one place to other is generally rectilinear
because the layout of the city is such that


307
0:36:11,56 --> 0:36:16,99
you move about one round about another and
there are parallel streets and so on.


308
0:36:16,99 --> 0:36:23,88
So it is essentially rectilinear if you are
talking about location of a facility in Chandigarh.


309
0:36:23,88 --> 0:36:32,38
Rectilinear distance could be any problem
which is an important distance measure. The


310
0:36:32,38 --> 0:36:38,47
next important distance that we consider is
what we call Euclidean distance measure. Euclidean


311
0:36:38,47 --> 0:36:41,38
distance measure is the shortest distance
between two points.


312
0:36:41,38 --> 0:36:48,57
The Euclidean distance from the point X which
you want to determine to the existing facility


313
0:36:48,57 --> 0:36:56,7
Pi, ai, bi, you have this particular distance
which is the shortest distance between 2 points.


314
0:36:56,7 --> 0:37:3,83
It is governed by this function x – ai whole
square + y – bi whole square and the square


315
0:37:3,83 --> 0:37:13,41
root of this. This can be conveniently calculated
in this fashion. Where do you think Euclidean


316
0:37:13,41 --> 0:37:26,849
distance will be appropriate in the location
problem? Where do you think you could consider


317
0:37:26,849 --> 0:37:31,44
where things take place? Let us say generally
straight line generally and if you are trying


318
0:37:31,44 --> 0:37:38,84
to talk about this, what would happen? For
instance if you are talking about the location


319
0:37:38,84 --> 0:37:43,94
of an airport, you know that you are going
to expect flights from a large number of cities


320
0:37:43,94 --> 0:37:49,57
in India and abroad here and flights going
out. So that would determine the weights for


321
0:37:49,57 --> 0:37:56,17
the cities and since you travel almost a straight
line, you could say that the determination


322
0:37:56,17 --> 0:37:59,98
of the optimum location of the airport could
be (Refer Slide Time: 38:00) but there are


323
0:37:59,98 --> 0:38:3,77
other considerations like determination of
the airport. But definitely from the point


324
0:38:3,77 --> 0:38:11,54
to view a minimization of the total travel,
this would be an optimum situation.


325
0:38:11,54 --> 0:38:24,64
Then where else you think this would be appropriate?
It all depends up on whether naval applications,


326
0:38:24,64 --> 0:38:33,2
whether you travel straight or you travel
all over the sea, how you travel and so on.


327
0:38:33,2 --> 0:38:47,15
For instance suppose you travel by this trolley
car or a ropeway, suppose if in the mountains,


328
0:38:47,15 --> 0:38:53,5
the government wants to decide up on picnic
spot and it was to find out the location of


329
0:38:53,5 --> 0:39:1,22
a ropeway and this way you could probably
visit location on one hill and the other hill


330
0:39:1,22 --> 0:39:8,44
wherever it is and different locations as
it is. Then which particular location will


331
0:39:8,44 --> 0:39:11,21
minimize the total cost of the cableway?


332
0:39:11,21 --> 0:39:20,109
Obviously it will be Euclidean distance. So
you could have a very large number of situations


333
0:39:20,109 --> 0:39:29,25
wherein if you are talking about electrical
circuit, you want to fix a particular component


334
0:39:29,25 --> 0:39:33,869
and the component is to be connected by a
wire to a number of different components assuming


335
0:39:33,869 --> 0:39:43,31
of course that if it could be done on a Euclidean
way in that particular component, then the


336
0:39:43,31 --> 0:39:50,349
location which tries to minimize the cost
of wire, the cost of cable etc but also be


337
0:39:50,349 --> 0:39:57,599
using the Euclidean. Finally let us look at
the problem where you are talking of squared


338
0:39:57,599 --> 0:40:3,26
Euclidean. This under root sign is missing
so we are talking about the square of the


339
0:40:3,26 --> 0:40:10,82
Euclidean distance. Square of the Euclidean
distance is just the distance but the square


340
0:40:10,82 --> 0:40:13,34
of it.


341
0:40:13,34 --> 0:40:20,849
Square Euclidean distance location problems
are also very relevant in many situations.


342
0:40:20,849 --> 0:40:31,5
They are relevant mainly in problems which
involves radiations. The radiation loss is


343
0:40:31,5 --> 0:40:38,8
typically proportional to the square of the
distance. You may remember your thermodynamics


344
0:40:38,8 --> 0:40:46,68
and see that the heat loss from a particular
source is proportional to the square of the


345
0:40:46,68 --> 0:40:55,5
Euclidean distance from that particular source.
Now this is something very important today


346
0:40:55,5 --> 0:41:4,2
because this is in the context of let us satellite
location problem or in the context of suppose


347
0:41:4,2 --> 0:41:10,44
you want to locate a satellite in space and
the satellite has to serve a number of existing


348
0:41:10,44 --> 0:41:16,75
location on the earth, it has to serve New
Delhi, Kolkata, Hyderabad, Singapore etc.


349
0:41:16,75 --> 0:41:22,26
So you have a number of m points which it
has to serve and let us say you know the weightages


350
0:41:22,26 --> 0:41:32,32
for these points so the idea is that the optimal
point for the satellite would be the one if


351
0:41:32,32 --> 0:41:36,55
you want to minimize the total radiation loss.


352
0:41:36,55 --> 0:41:46,1
You want to minimize the total radiation loss;
it should be located, such that this particular


353
0:41:46,1 --> 0:41:56,19
distance criterion is actually this particular
criterion. So the distance measure may be


354
0:41:56,19 --> 0:42:0,69
any other because you travel anyway so I have
to go from here to here, or I can go this


355
0:42:0,69 --> 0:42:6,839
way, I can go this way, I can travel on a
network in any particular manner and so on.


356
0:42:6,839 --> 0:42:14,8
So it could be other or any other network.
Those can be commonly used distances so what


357
0:42:14,8 --> 0:42:20,42
we do is normally the network location problem
is a practical problem because there you define


358
0:42:20,42 --> 0:42:25,49
exactly the distances from one node to the
other on the network. You can look at the


359
0:42:25,49 --> 0:42:32,63
network and try to solve the location problem
on the network.


360
0:42:32,63 --> 0:42:49,78
Now let us try to look at this particular
problem of rectilinear distances. In a rectilinear


361
0:42:49,78 --> 0:42:54,73
distance problem our objective function is
simply Z which is the total cost, which is


362
0:42:54,73 --> 0:43:2,57
the summation from i = 1 to n, wi into x – ai
+ y – bi mod. That is what it is, that is


363
0:43:2,57 --> 0:43:7,75
the rectilinear distance. The only interesting
thing here is that this particular function


364
0:43:7,75 --> 0:43:17,4
could be sort of broken up into wi into x
– ai mod + wi into y – bi mod and this


365
0:43:17,4 --> 0:43:24,53
can then be written as two separate summations.
The summation for x – ai mod and the summation


366
0:43:24,53 --> 0:43:30,55
for y – bi mod and the interesting thing
here is that this is the function of x alone.


367
0:43:30,55 --> 0:43:35,4
This (Refer Slide Time: 43:30) is the function
of y alone. So the problem of rectilinear


368
0:43:35,4 --> 0:43:42,359
distances is that if you want to minimize
Z what you have to basically do is you have


369
0:43:42,359 --> 0:43:49,25
to minimize f1 x and f2 y independently that
means optimum location for the rectilinear


370
0:43:49,25 --> 0:43:58,51
distance location problem is determined simply
independently minimizing f1 x and f2 y. Now


371
0:43:58,51 --> 0:44:5,51
you can determine the procedure for doing
this and rather than deriving the procedure


372
0:44:5,51 --> 0:44:11,64
I would state the procedure here in fact in
this particular situation, the f1 x and f2


373
0:44:11,64 --> 0:44:17,96
y are minimized, if you locate at the medium
location, that is the result. That actually


374
0:44:17,96 --> 0:44:24,73
comes from duality theory. We can look at
the proof in the tutorials.


375
0:44:24,73 --> 0:44:37,3
Let us take an example to illustrate what
we have been talking about and we will use


376
0:44:37,3 --> 0:44:44,14
this frame work of the example on different
distance measure. For instance let us assume


377
0:44:44,14 --> 0:44:51,119
that service facility to serve five offices
located at (0, 0), (3, 16), (18, 2), (8, 18)


378
0:44:51,119 --> 0:44:58,65
and (20, 2) is to be set up. It is like saying
the number of cars transported per day between


379
0:44:58,65 --> 0:45:4,82
the new service facility which you want to
set up and the offices equal 5, 22, 41, 60


380
0:45:4,82 --> 0:45:10,91
and 34 respectively. So the question is what
location for the service facility will minimize


381
0:45:10,91 --> 0:45:17,79
the distance, the cars are transported per
day? It is like saying that you have collection


382
0:45:17,79 --> 0:45:27,1
centers for cars at 5 places and cannot place
south Delhi etc. You also want to have central


383
0:45:27,1 --> 0:45:34,83
service facility. Where will you avail the
service? The people can deposit their cars


384
0:45:34,83 --> 0:45:39,82
here and their experience shows that the number
of cars deposited per day is so much so where


385
0:45:39,82 --> 0:45:45,41
should your service facility be? This is the
problem and we are assuming that the distance


386
0:45:45,41 --> 0:45:50,22
involved is rectilinear.


387
0:45:50,22 --> 0:45:55,72
So as I indicated to you, the answer to this
problem is that we can determine the x coordinate


388
0:45:55,72 --> 0:46:1,44
and the y coordinate independently and the
x coordinate is nothing but a median location.


389
0:46:1,44 --> 0:46:8,5
So this simply means if we arrange the entire
x coordinates in ascending order, these are


390
0:46:8,5 --> 0:46:14,369
0, 3, 18, 20 and this is corresponding to
the existing facility 1, Corresponding to


391
0:46:14,369 --> 0:46:19,75
the existing facility 2, this is corresponding
to existing facility 4, this is corresponding


392
0:46:19,75 --> 0:46:24,54
to the existing facility 3, and 5. So ascending
order of the x coordinates and we determine


393
0:46:24,54 --> 0:46:31,839
the weights. Weights are the number of cars
that come here, 3, 22, 60, 41, and 34. Determine


394
0:46:31,839 --> 0:46:41,57
the cumulative weight, this should be 3, rather
this should be 5. This is error somewhere,


395
0:46:41,57 --> 0:46:48,6
so misprint. So you have 5, let us say 5 is
the cumulative weight here and then 27 and


396
0:46:48,6 --> 0:46:56,589
then 87 and then 128 and then 162. What needs
to be done is if the total cumulative weight


397
0:46:56,589 --> 0:47:2,339
i.e., 162 is the sum of the weights, half
of that is 81. So you find out where the cumulative


398
0:47:2,339 --> 0:47:7,54
weight changes, that is this is less than
81 and this is greater than 81.


399
0:47:7,54 --> 0:47:12,66
This becomes greater than 81 here for the
first time. So this row determines the optimal


400
0:47:12,66 --> 0:47:19,7
solution. A very simple straightforward and
therefore x star = 8. So we have determined


401
0:47:19,7 --> 0:47:24,47
the optimum x coordinates for this particular
problem. The rectilinear distance location


402
0:47:24,47 --> 0:47:34,43
problem is merely a median location. So this
is how you determine the median location then


403
0:47:34,43 --> 0:47:40,47
we can do a similar procedure for the y coordinate.
When you do the y coordinate what happens


404
0:47:40,47 --> 0:47:47,849
is that if you arrange the y coordinate in
ascending order 0, 2, 16 and 18, you find


405
0:47:47,849 --> 0:47:53,359
that this corresponds to the first facility.
Both the facilities 3 and 5 share this coordinates


406
0:47:53,359 --> 0:47:59,849
so we write both of them here and 2 and then
4 in that order and then the weights which


407
0:47:59,849 --> 0:48:10,579
are there are 5, 14, so this is 5 in the previous
slide, it should have been 5. This is 5, so


408
0:48:10,579 --> 0:48:21,82
this particular value should be 5 (Refer Slide
Time: 48:19). Now we have 80 again, you have


409
0:48:21,82 --> 0:48:27,41
the total cumulative weight which is 162,
half of that, this is less than this, this


410
0:48:27,41 --> 0:48:31,55
is greater than this (Refer Slide Time: 48:30),
so where the cumulative weight first exceeds


411
0:48:31,55 --> 0:48:38,22
half the value, that row is here, so corresponding
to this we can identify that y star = 16,


412
0:48:38,22 --> 0:48:46,68
it is very simple. So you observe that we
can determine the x star and the y star value


413
0:48:46,68 --> 0:48:52,2
independently by similar procedures by just
identifying the median and we have identified


414
0:48:52,2 --> 0:49:6,98
the median. So in this particular case we
now have 
in fact determined both x star and y star.


415
0:49:6,98 --> 0:49:16,4
So x star is 8 and y star is 16, so 8,16 becomes
the optimum location for the service facility,


416
0:49:16,4 --> 0:49:20,94
that means this will minimize the total cost
of travel, that is the optimum solution or


417
0:49:20,94 --> 0:49:27,91
the ideal solution for the location of the
service facility for this particular problem.


418
0:49:27,91 --> 0:49:41,52
Now let us look at the case where you find
that the distance measure is, let us say square


419
0:49:41,52 --> 0:49:45,849
Euclidean. We will not talk about the Euclidean
case now. We shall talk about it later but


420
0:49:45,849 --> 0:49:51,95
let us talk about the squared Euclidean case
that is the satellite location problem. So


421
0:49:51,95 --> 0:49:57,23
the location is also another interesting problem
here. You know it would be like trying to


422
0:49:57,23 --> 0:50:4,63
say that suppose in the squared Euclidean
problem, the optimum location is in fact in


423
0:50:4,63 --> 0:50:11,7
this case, centroid location. This can be
proved very easily. So the centroid location


424
0:50:11,7 --> 0:50:18,99
for this problem is simply x star = summation
wi ai divided by summation wi, y star is equal


425
0:50:18,99 --> 0:50:25,48
to summation wi bi divided by summation wi.
So for the same problem that we considered


426
0:50:25,48 --> 0:50:31,79
earlier for the Euclidean distance, for the
rectilinear distance case, we can easily determine


427
0:50:31,79 --> 0:50:38,68
this summation wi in the denominator. It is
162 which is the total weight. Sum of the


428
0:50:38,68 --> 0:50:50,0
weights and x star is 12.12; y star is 9.77.
So if your distance measure is a squared Euclidean,


429
0:50:50,0 --> 0:50:57,8
it would be best to locate the new facility
at 12.12 and 9.77 and obviously this differs


430
0:50:57,8 --> 0:51:7,32
from the earlier median location that we determined
of 816. I am just trying to tell you that


431
0:51:7,32 --> 0:51:16,119
if you are still not very clear about when
you should use the squared Euclidean case,


432
0:51:16,119 --> 0:51:31,89
suppose your set of 5, 6 friends are celebrating
a bonfire in winter, imagine the situation


433
0:51:31,89 --> 0:51:38,53
and they are standing or sitting in a certain
location around bonfire, then the question


434
0:51:38,53 --> 0:51:45,89
is which is the best position for the bonfire
such that the total loss of heat energy is


435
0:51:45,89 --> 0:51:51,82
minimum for all these guys. So if that is
to happen, the bonfire should be at the centroid


436
0:51:51,82 --> 0:51:57,28
of all these points, where the people are
sitting. That is exactly where the satellite


437
0:51:57,28 --> 0:52:0,8
location problem is in terms of whatever it
is.


438
0:52:0,8 --> 0:52:7,7
So this can be determined very simply by saying
12.12 and y star is also is equal to 9.77


439
0:52:7,7 --> 0:52:12,99
and therefore you can determine the centroid
location very easily.


440
0:52:12,99 --> 0:52:23,99
In this particular case if you now look at
the Euclidean distance locations which is


441
0:52:23,99 --> 0:52:29,619
the third problem that we are trying to talk
about, you recall that one simple way of solving


442
0:52:29,619 --> 0:52:39,7
this problem is by using the mechanical analogy
that was developed by varianon in the frame


443
0:52:39,7 --> 0:52:45,52
which we call a varianon frame. All that we
have done was all these points are raw materials


444
0:52:45,52 --> 0:52:53,54
sources and markets so all the total points
are actually plotted here to scale and then


445
0:52:53,54 --> 0:53:0,119
you take the required number of strings, tie
them to a common knot, and pass one string


446
0:53:0,119 --> 0:53:4,8
through each of these holes which you have
drilled here. Then you can hang a weight.


447
0:53:4,8 --> 0:53:10,4
This is equal to the weight corresponding
to that particular point. You allow the system


448
0:53:10,4 --> 0:53:17,38
to come to equilibrium and when that happens,
the location of P is actually the solution


449
0:53:17,38 --> 0:53:22,579
to the Euclidean distance location problem.


450
0:53:22,579 --> 0:53:29,73
As we had seen the other day, normally this
method of constructing the varianon frame


451
0:53:29,73 --> 0:53:36,7
and the strings models is quite cumbersome.
So mathematical procedures are available by


452
0:53:36,7 --> 0:53:42,96
means of which you can compute this particular
point but there are certain mathematical complications


453
0:53:42,96 --> 0:53:52,5
in this analysis and therefore the resort
has to be made to iterative heuristic procedure


454
0:53:52,5 --> 0:53:57,1
for getting this particular point. So getting
this point mean that you start with a trail


455
0:53:57,1 --> 0:54:3,2
point P and the trail point P most of the
solutions is the solution to the centroid


456
0:54:3,2 --> 0:54:9,65
problem you can start with 12.12 and 9.77
and then keep iterating in certain fashion.


457
0:54:9,65 --> 0:54:16,2
We will then talk about the algorithm in the
tutorials, how it is done. But essentially


458
0:54:16,2 --> 0:54:21,97
this is an exact solution of the Euclidean
distance location problem which you can see


459
0:54:21,97 --> 0:54:35,42
from here and I think that gives you a broad
idea of how these problems are. Yes, I think


460
0:54:35,42 --> 0:54:43,829
so far all the problems that we have considered;
it can be termed as minisum problem that means


461
0:54:43,829 --> 0:54:46,3
it comes to the objective function.


462
0:54:46,3 --> 0:54:52,72
In all cases the objective was to minimize
the sum of the total travel from the facility


463
0:54:52,72 --> 0:54:59,41
to all other facilities. If you are talking
about locating a central service station,


464
0:54:59,41 --> 0:55:3,55
so you are talking about the cost of movement
from the service station to the first facility


465
0:55:3,55 --> 0:55:9,1
from the service station to second facility
and so on. This sum was there. So all the


466
0:55:9,1 --> 0:55:13,63
three problems that we have considered so
far were actually minisum problems where you


467
0:55:13,63 --> 0:55:21,4
are trying to minimize the total sum. Now
in many instances especially in emergency


468
0:55:21,4 --> 0:55:27,109
location problem it is not appropriate to
think of a mini sum objective.


469
0:55:27,109 --> 0:55:32,38
It is better to think in terms of what we
call a minimax objective. For example it is


470
0:55:32,38 --> 0:55:41,109
like saying if these are the resistances of
different people in different locality and


471
0:55:41,109 --> 0:55:46,56
you are trying to find out the location of
a fire station, The location of the fire station


472
0:55:46,56 --> 0:55:50,609
should not be such, the total cost to this
plus this plus this plus (Refer Slide Time:


473
0:55:50,609 --> 0:55:57,4
55:50) this should be minimum because when
a fire breaks out, the fire tender has to


474
0:55:57,4 --> 0:56:2,53
run to that particular place. So really speaking,
the location of the fire station should be


475
0:56:2,53 --> 0:56:10,69
such that it should be nearest to the farthest
point.


476
0:56:10,69 --> 0:56:18,609
You are trying to minimize the maximum distance
from that particular in all emergency location,


477
0:56:18,609 --> 0:56:24,4
mimimax problems are quite common. For the
location of emergency facilities our objective


478
0:56:24,4 --> 0:56:29,29
would be to minimize the maximum distance
just to give a motivation without going into


479
0:56:29,29 --> 0:56:37,829
details. For instance these were the points
and you want to locate a facility. The idea


480
0:56:37,829 --> 0:56:43,8
is that what would be a minimax location?
A minimax location will be we try to enclose


481
0:56:43,8 --> 0:56:50,22
these in a circle and the circle which has
the minimum diameter. The center of that circle


482
0:56:50,22 --> 0:56:53,3
which is let us say this one (Refer Slide
Time: 52:61) encloses these points. This is


483
0:56:53,3 --> 0:56:59,2
the circle which encloses all these facilities
with the minimum diameter. This circle is


484
0:56:59,2 --> 0:57:5,13
larger and there could be other larger circles.
Basically what we are seeking is this circle


485
0:57:5,13 --> 0:57:13,7
and the center of this is optimum location.
Now graphically it is very wonderful to look


486
0:57:13,7 --> 0:57:19,69
at this particular procedure and there are
algorithms for instance there is a beautiful


487
0:57:19,69 --> 0:57:24,8
algorithm by Elzinga and Hearn which is actually
based on this analogy. So this is just to


488
0:57:24,8 --> 0:57:30,24
tell you that if the objective function changes,
the problem is no longer a minisum problem


489
0:57:30,24 --> 0:57:34,92
but a minimax problem. Finally let us look
at this complication.


490
0:57:34,92 --> 0:57:40,589
For instance we determine an ideal location
by these mathematical procedures, if we determine


491
0:57:40,589 --> 0:57:45,5
an ideal location what may happen is that
the ideal location may not be available. There


492
0:57:45,5 --> 0:57:50,13
might be a building, there might be a river
running through it or there might be other


493
0:57:50,13 --> 0:57:55,349
complications and you cannot locate because
in solving the problem, in determining the


494
0:57:55,349 --> 0:58:2,72
ideal solutions, we have taken into consideration
the feasibility of these locations. So what


495
0:58:2,72 --> 0:58:9,68
is interesting is that we can build cost contours.
These are lines of constant cost. So this


496
0:58:9,68 --> 0:58:14,79
is the minimum cost of optimal location. Cost
increases by 5 percent, by 10 percent, by


497
0:58:14,79 --> 0:58:20,88
15 percent, by 20 percent whatever it is and
you have lines of constant cost. This will


498
0:58:20,88 --> 0:58:25,819
help you to choose an alternative location.
These are very much like lines of constant


499
0:58:25,819 --> 0:58:32,43
height on a map; on a geographical map you
have lines of constant height. Similarly you


500
0:58:32,43 --> 0:58:39,45
have lines of constant cost and this mapping
once is done would give you ideas as to which


501
0:58:39,45 --> 0:58:46,369
side you should shift, where is the cost lesser,
where is the cost more and there are procedures


502
0:58:46,369 --> 0:58:52,51
to develop the cost contours. In fact in the
tutorial exercises you will have an opportunity


503
0:58:52,51 --> 0:59:0,609
to develop these cost contours. Finally let
us see what we have done in this particular


504
0:59:0,609 --> 0:59:0,98
lecture


505
0:59:0,98 --> 0:59:8,619
We started with looking at a practical problem,
a case study and we saw that the decision


506
0:59:8,619 --> 0:59:14,48
matrix approach to handle multiple objectives
in plant location was in fact very worthwhile


507
0:59:14,48 --> 0:59:22,3
approach to consider all the objectives and
consider the feasible solution. Basically


508
0:59:22,3 --> 0:59:31,79
this problem could be termed as a problem
of choosing the best amongst options. Then


509
0:59:31,79 --> 0:59:37,64
we have the single facility location models.
We talked about the rectilinear distance,


510
0:59:37,64 --> 0:59:42,69
the squared Euclidean distance, the Euclidean
distance where the objective was to generate


511
0:59:42,69 --> 0:59:49,52
the best from the infinite options which are
available and finally we talked about the


512
0:59:49,52 --> 0:59:55,64
notion of minisum and minimax problems where
the objectives could change depending up on


513
0:59:55,64 --> 1:0:3,13
the context. Finally we saw our cost contour
that can help to accommodate practical constraints


514
1:0:3,13 --> 1:0:13,18
that is moving from ideal to a feasible solution.
So with this we conclude this particular lecture


515
1:0:13,18 --> 1:0:20,77
and in the next lecture we will go over to
the facility layout problem which is the next


516
1:0:20,77 --> 1:0:23,93
important problem in the context of facility
location.


517
1:0:23,93 --> 1:2:23,93
Thank you
