###3 CHRISANN BRENNAN: I just wrote this.
###5 It wasn't a part of my talk.
###7 And I want to say that I know a lot of people
###9 have profound feelings about Steve Jobs.
###12 He was a gem and a rare one.
###16 And I want to ask you to please only
###20 take what's of value of my talk today and let the rest go.
###26 This is such a new world to me.
###28 So many people have so many thoughts.
###30 
###33 There's so many angles of perception on him.
###36 But today, I'm simply talking about my perceptions.
###39 And I hope you'll feel it's a valuable contribution in total.
###47 I also want to say that I don't really
###48 know the technical world that you guys live in.
###51 I don't know what he created.
###54 So this is a new experience for me.
###57 
###62 And please forgive me for my naivete at certain points.
###67 So I'll begin.
###68 
###71 Today, I wanted to talk about creativity and initiative,
###75 first mine in writing my book and then Steve's in creativity
###80 as I perceived it.
###82 And thirdly, about Creativity, with a capital C,
###85 into the future.
###87 Because whether we're talking about children, new technology,
###91 the arts, companies, countries, or the whole world,
###96 now more than ever we need to be more conscious in our creating.
###102 We're all so creative that I think
###104 we need a metalevel of considerations, councils
###108 even, to figure out where we're going
###110 and what we want our outcomes to be.
###115 Here I am at Google, and you have the unofficial byline
###119 of "don't be evil."
###121 And this is what I'm talking about, except more of it,
###125 a long list of ethical considerations
###128 that people can cross-check because everything
###131 is affected by our creating.
###132 
###137 Before I start diving into my story,
###143 I want you to know that I'm predominantly right brained.
###146 I wrote this book cinemagraphically
###149 because I'm first and foremost an artist.
###152 And the practices of filming help me bridge my experience
###155 as a painter into writing.
###159 I think in a combination of images, symbols, metaphors,
###162 and words.
###163 In fact, I don't even think there's
###165 a big difference between symbols, images, metaphors,
###169 and words because they're as much an energetic fact
###175 as this podium is for me.
###178 Mainly, I think in terms of energetics.
###181 And I see energy and I have found visualization
###184 to be a force for actualisation.
###185 
###193 This is one of my most recent paintings.
###196 It was commissioned.
###197 And yet when I paint for someone else, I also paint for myself.
###203 The painting lay the ground for my book.
###205 This was my version of an outline.
###210 I didn't know what it fully meant
###211 until I was well into the writing.
###213 In fact, I'm still discovering what it means.
###217 I think the future is about left and right brain integration
###221 too.
###222 Its the evolutionary next step for people everywhere.
###227 And it's, of course, already started.
###231 If I have time, which I don't think I will,
###233 I'll do a quick decode on the painting
###236 at the end of the talk.
###239 And if I don't, I'll post the image and a decode
###242 on my book's website, thebiteintheapple.com,
###246 by the end of February.
###247 
###252 So there were three things that I
###255 decided I would never do in this life.
###258 I had enough self-knowledge by the time I was 35 years old
###262 to know what I wasn't interested or good at.
###265 One was study of history.
###268 I'd gotten crippling migraines, at least
###270 once a week, in my US history classes when I was young.
###274 I wasn't interested in so much focus on men's wars, politics,
###280 and treaties.
###281 Number two is that I would never play the drums
###284 because my sense of rhythm was so reliably wonky.
###289 Number three is that I'd never write a book,
###292 since writing was not my strength
###294 and because I knew it was way too much information
###298 to organize and be accountable to.
###302 Yet here I've written a book, and it's own history,
###305 and it was in part due to the rhythms in the language
###309 that I became interested in the craft of writing
###311 for its own sake.
###314 I'd written a couple of good papers in art college.
###317 But prior to writing this book, that
###319 was my only experience of real concentrated writing.
###324 Writing is traumatic and stressful for me.
###327 I love the ideas, but they seem to bottleneck
###329 if I have to sequence them on a page.
###332 Yet I decided I had to write this book myself
###336 because the process of writing was
###339 the only way I could drop down into a depth of memory
###344 and manage my own message.
###346 I started in 2006.
###349 And it took me over six years of full-time work to complete.
###354 Now I tell myself pay attention to what I would never do,
###358 because writing this book has been
###361 one of the most important things I've ever done.
###364 I also want to emphasize that if I can write this book,
###367 I'm really sure almost anybody can do anything.
###372 Over the years, a few people had suggested I write my story.
###376 Yet many more warned me off of it,
###380 even going so far to suggest that I didn't have the right
###383 to speak about my life or my history
###386 since it involved Steve Jobs.
###387 And I think many people were assuming the worst
###390 and implying that it was bad form for a woman
###394 to speak about the personal life of a man who
###397 was a public figure.
###399 But I did not write this as a tell-all.
###403 Instead, I felt my story was important, one, because I knew
###406 Steve before it all happened and also because we came
###410 of age together in a certain way.
###414 Two, because I witnessed firsthand Steve's changes
###418 as Apple began.
###420 And three, because we co-parented the child
###422 through all the years.
###424 Also four, I have a universal message
###427 and there's a universal message in my book.
###432 Steve and I met when we were 17.
###434 And I was his first love and I'm the mother
###436 of his first child and my only child.
###439 We knew, loved, and admired each other.
###442 And when things got difficult between us as Apple took off,
###447 I witnessed his incremental changes
###450 from sweet, mystic, poet, super-bright, goofy guy
###454 into a ruthless, stunningly successful business tycoon.
###459 In the end, it is precisely because of my direct experience
###463 with him that I feel I have important contributions
###467 to make on the body of knowledge with him.
###470 And the other thing is I never intended to pull him
###477 from hero status.
###479 I know so many people love him.
###481 And it would've been a balanced approach.
###486 I was always more interested in the human side of him.
###491 Did I understand everything that happened with Steve Jobs?
###494 Absolutely not.
###495 But I still think I have an unusual vantage
###497 point of some things that I think
###500 are unique and will be valued, may be valued, will be valued.
###505 So much seems to hang on my memory, my integrity,
###510 and my insight.
###513 In 2006, I became sick and it lasted for years.
###517 I had one of those undiagnosable illnesses
###520 that probably came from a combination of exhaustion,
###524 mold in the apartment I was living in,
###527 and too much exposure to fumes from painting.
###530 With a compromised immune system,
###533 I got one terrible illness after another
###536 and had to spend a lot of time doing nothing.
###540 Bored and languishing, I slowed way, way down
###544 and became willing to consider and then
###546 to decide to write my story.
###549 So with nothing else to occupy my time
###552 and in the most tremulous, naive,
###555 childish first steps that I began
###558 by writing a list of chapters and some good ideas
###562 in a cafe in Tiburon, California.
###566 To say I was reluctant to be public about Steve
###569 and my long history is an understatement.
###573 It's nuanced and a difficult story.
###576 And it was hard to sort through.
###578 Also I didn't want to relive the pain.
###581 Of course, Steve didn't want me to write it
###583 and this was hard on me too, mainly because it put pressure
###587 on our daughter, who was going back and forth between our two
###590 households.
###591 Additionally, for years I absolutely questioned daily
###594 if I had what it took to write this book.
###597 And I put it down a couple of times,
###599 only to return to it with just greater commitment.
###603 One because the ideas were so rich,
###605 that they just seem too important, and also too
###608 interesting to drop.
###610 And two, because there was this exquisite sense
###614 of the pause in the writing process that I loved.
###619 The mounting silence of the years coming up to the tipping
###623 point and then their remarkable fall into words.
###630 I worked on the first 100 pages for two years,
###632 trying to figure out how to weave all the complexity
###635 into something readable.
###636 I worked seven days a week, about two to three hours a day,
###639 which took pretty much all the energy I had.
###643 When I started to get physically better,
###645 I committed to five hours a day, seven days a week.
###648 A huge turning point came for me three years
###650 into the project when a colleague took my first 70
###654 pages and turned them into discrete, coherent chapters.
###659 Once I understood how to make a chapter,
###662 I completed the next 19 chapters in the second three years.
###667 My daily experience was that I would
###669 wake up early every morning and begin with the inspiration,
###673 working out all kinds of ideas.
###675 And yet no matter what, by the end of every day
###678 I was purely mortified by what I had written.
###682 This is a strange and strained history.
###686 The subject was over the top and I
###689 was deeply concerned about how it
###691 would affect our daughter's life.
###694 Also I felt that my story is, was
###698 a part of the collective unconscious
###700 and I feared no one wanted to hear from me.
###704 Add to this the fact that I didn't know the writing
###707 conventions for start talking about such a dicey subject,
###711 the personal and impersonal.
###714 I don't read that much.
###716 I had little experience in communicating
###718 about such difficulty in a balanced,
###720 truthful, and intelligent way.
###723 Five years into my project, I was still fretting
###726 and I told a friend I needed a Ph.D. to write this book.
###730 And she said, well, Steve didn't have a Ph.D. to do what he did.
###734 So get over it.
###735 Keep going.
###737 People have assumed I kept a journal
###740 because the detail in the book is so clear and descriptive.
###744 But I didn't have a journal.
###746 I'm just extremely observant and I
###750 seem to track detail through all my senses.
###754 Plus, this history had somehow stayed
###756 in something like a morphic field around me
###759 through the years because I assume
###762 it was waiting and pressing on me to understand
###765 what had happened.
###767 As I said, the process of writing was interesting to me.
###771 And there were times that things that seemed insignificant
###776 buzzed at me to explore more deeply.
###780 And when I followed them, they opened up my awareness
###784 into new connections and new revelations.
###788 Other times after getting the best sentences down
###790 I could, I had to double and triple check for the truth.
###793 In going back and forth between the descriptions and the truth,
###798 further detail would emerge.
###800 I found I also found that using word combinations
###806 of opposite meaning helped me grasp
###809 in language the startling extremes that
###812 were the hallmarks of Steve's personality and charisma
###816 after Apple started.
###819 All in all, the craft of writing itself
###822 distracted me from the pain, even
###825 as I granulated down into it.
###828 
###831 I have a type of dyslexia, some kind of dyslexia.
###835 And being that that was the case,
###836 I really could not have written this book
###839 with a pencil or even a typewriter.
###841 I don't think sequentially.
###843 Much of the material was so upsetting.
###846 And yet with a computer, it was all
###848 made easier, as I was able to move clusters
###851 of ideas around it big swaths to work out right connection
###856 points, that opened up more insight and balance.
###862 The plasticity that the writing with the computer provided me
###866 was like painting and it allowed for layering.
###870 And so it made it possible for me
###872 to handle the many years, while still
###875 having fun exploring the intricacies of ideas
###878 I was trying to access, layer, and get across.
###884 Then after a while, something unexpected
###886 started happening, which never would have occurred
###889 if I had been so focused on getting it right--
###892 if I hadn't been so focused.
###895 As I relived the scenes in order to write them,
###898 I became more of a witness to it all
###901 and started picking up new levels of detail
###903 that I had missed when I had been
###905 so young, living through it.
###907 Plus the more attention I brought to the history,
###911 the more I saw and the more I felt
###914 that I was changing the history inside myself.
###919 Consciousness changes everything.
###922 For so long, I had met Steve's ideas of things
###927 define my reality.
###930 And he had become defensive, and fast, and intelligent,
###936 and somewhat disconnected from his heart
###938 as he grew into Apple.
###940 Out of this, he sometimes projected the worst stuff
###946 on me, faster than I could process through it.
###951 Yet as I slowed down and focused on my experience,
###955 I realize that things were not as he had so deftly chalked
###961 them up to be.
###963 In a certain way, I had been buried by Steve, the Zen
###967 master, and the Apple-- or the machine behind Apple.
###972 But when I stepped back into the history
###974 to quietly tell myself my story as I experienced it,
###979 the "her" story of it all, it was like waking up.
###983 Spin is a powerful thing.
###986 Interpretation is a powerful thing.
###989 But the truth is more powerful within your own context.
###994 A single voice does make a difference.
###997 We don't necessarily hear ourselves
###999 when others won't hear us.
###1001 But in writing, I finally heard myself.
###1005 I also discovered that forgiveness
###1007 is a process and a very long haul, but a worthy one.
###1012 A line from an ancient Hindu text
###1014 had replayed in my mind for years.
###1017 It was a basic principle of creativity, karmic law,
###1021 and life.
###1022 And it said, one must rise by that by which one falls.
###1027 And here I found that by doing the work of writing,
###1031 I was able to climb up and out of my tremendous self-loss
###1036 into a lighter, truer being.
###1039 
###1044 Throughout the writing, as a discipline,
###1045 I cross-checked some of the more complicated memories
###1049 with people who were also there at certain points
###1052 in the history and I got confirmations.
###1055 They had understood things as I had, which was a great relief.
###1061 This, in addition to 10 years of visionary painting,
###1064 the six years of writing, and I not only recovered my story,
###1069 I used the whole experience to understand the history
###1073 through a wisdom and compassion trajectory.
###1076 So that in essence, the book provided me
###1079 the rare opportunity to review my life
###1082 and take time to work it out and update
###1084 it an ethical framework for my 50-year-old self.
###1088 
###1091 In the second 2/3 of the book, as I
###1096 lived how bad things had been, I found
###1099 that I was traversing what was for me how
###1101 realms of such destitute feelings, that the only way
###1105 I remember true loveliness was the little birds
###1108 singing outside my windows in the morning.
###1111 The work was really dramatic and extreme.
###1113 But on the other hand, the terribleness had an upside.
###1117 It enlivened my sense of determination.
###1120 Diving into the dark and surfacing
###1123 is the artistic process.
###1125 And I'm no stranger to that.
###1127 I just had never done it in words before and never
###1131 on the same subject for so long.
###1134 Long story short, I dug my heels in
###1137 and decided I was going to get my book written
###1141 or die doing it.
###1143 It was a messy process getting into the do or die part,
###1147 but eventually I realized that what I was really saying
###1151 was the opposite.
###1152 I was going to get the book written
###1153 and live more fully as a result of it.
###1156 Some people mistakenly think I'm obsessed and fascinated
###1160 by Steve Jobs.
###1161 But this is not accurate.
###1163 I was obsessed by getting at the truth
###1166 and fascinated by my revelations.
###1170 It felt wonderful to speak, and be funny, and open my heart,
###1173 and tell the truth.
###1176 It felt to me like I was driving a little car over hill
###1178 and dale, looking out the windows
###1181 and reflecting on the views.
###1183 I wanted to know why he had been so cruel after we
###1186 had been so deeply in love.
###1188 I just kept staying with the question
###1190 until I got the bigger answers.
###1193 I also wanted to put it in its place and move on.
###1197 I did become more interested and appreciative
###1200 of Steve's history, but it was only
###1203 after I had renewed my perceptions of myself.
###1208 As I mentioned before, I'd been concerned all along
###1212 that my writing book this would be hard on our daughter.
###1216 And the way that worked is that the more I wrote,
###1220 the more I felt it was going to be a bigger problem for her
###1224 and the world if the world didn't have her mother's story
###1231 and if I didn't become strong and clear enough to tell it.
###1235 I think that what failed in Steve Jobs is
###1238 as important as what succeeded.
###1240 Both aspects should be studied, partly
###1244 because he's so remarkable.
###1246 Well, because he's so remarkable.
###1249 Also I know that a woman's inner story may seem far less
###1257 exciting as a man's worldly story.
###1265 In fact, for women it may be that the inner story of a woman
###1271 is more interesting than a man's worldly story.
###1274 But beyond all this, I want my great-great-grandchildren,
###1278 should I be lucky enough to have them,
###1281 know what a bit of their grandmother's life and times,
###1283 as well as your grandfather's.
###1286 I think it will be healthy and happy for them
###1288 because against all this dull expectations, I feel Steve
###1292 and I were equals.
###1294 He simply had more power because the laws favor men and money
###1299 over women and children at this time.
###1301 I hope you don't mind me being a little political.
###1303 
###1308 The other thing that truly inspired me to write
###1314 is that in many ways my story is an all too familiar one.
###1318 Many women have had their own experience with brilliant men.
###1322 And truthfully, it's not just women
###1323 who are suffering from the situation.
###1325 Obviously, it's a destructive context for all of us.
###1328 The world is dealing with a huge power imbalance, Wall Street,
###1333 corporate heads, news corporations,
###1342 that sort of confuse and drain people
###1344 in their personal power, at least
###1346 that's the apparent reality.
###1347 
###1350 So then I'd like to see a genius bar working
###1356 to fix the brokenness at this level.
###1359 Maybe we could call it the ethics bar.
###1364 Eventually, I started to figure out
###1365 that I could access the highest integrity inside myself
###1369 by steering my writing between truth and kindness.
###1373 If I could not say what had to be said is kindness,
###1376 then I kept working to understand more deeply.
###1379 If I could not tell the truth because it was too terrible,
###1382 then I kept looking for ways to say things
###1385 with more breath and allowance.
###1387 The extremes of negative and positive relationship
###1392 in the adult Steve Jobs and Chrisann Brennan
###1398 were and still are too problematic to be public about.
###1402 And sometimes I was thinking all the way
###1404 through the book about Jung's "Red Book,"
###1407 the one he locked up for 70 years
###1409 because he didn't think people were
###1411 ready to take in the contents.
###1414 And I completely understand his impulse to hold back.
###1418 Steve expanded the spectrum in ways
###1422 that went beyond the range of humanness.
###1425 
###1428 And I mean that in both the good and the difficult way.
###1431 
###1434 And I finally figured out I could approach the story
###1438 if I stayed in the middle.
###1441 Then I could express enough truth
###1444 and that likely some readers were even
###1446 going to be able to sense the shapes of the things
###1448 I couldn't say.
###1450 Another exercise I put myself through
###1453 was to pose the question, if everything is love,
###1457 if this whole universe is love, which
###1461 is what the mystics support, and I
###1463 am willing to believe, how do I understand love
###1468 in the context of what happened between Steve and me?
###1473 Love is law and law is based on love.
###1477 What happened was lawless.
###1481 Yet, I didn't want to make Steve look like a spot monster that
###1485 was too big for me to handle.
###1487 And I didn't want to make myself into a tiny speck
###1490 of a victim that couldn't deal with it.
###1493 That would have been way too easy.
###1495 I wanted to transcend the polarization
###1498 and the lawlessness.
###1500 I wanted to find my power in the center of it all.
###1503 I wanted a kind of equanimity, a true equanimity.
###1508 
###1511 I think that Steve was a remarkable empath, who
###1515 became a colossal bully.
###1519 I'm sorry for those of you who love him.
###1522 I think he was a liar, a bully, a trickster, a thief.
###1526 And I think he was a sociopath.
###1529 Yet, he was also an honest, remarkable, mystic, creator,
###1535 genius, visionary, who wanted to see people freed up
###1539 through the tools he made.
###1541 What a cluster.
###1544 Another creative principle I found in another Hindu text
###1548 says, divided into two parts I create.
###1553 At first, I felt blimied and even
###1555 lazy to parse through the polar opposites, his polar opposites.
###1561 But then I became very interested
###1563 in understanding the differences between Steve's light and dark
###1568 sides because why else should I write this book?
###1573 The independent spirit in me always
###1575 got around to the same conclusion.
###1577 I choose to be bigger than the cruelty and the indifference.
###1581 I am going to tell the truth and I'm
###1582 going to trust that I have the tools to do it
###1585 without doing harm.
###1587 Moreover, I may end up having to trust
###1592 the pieces to fly and fall as they may.
###1596 But I'm willing to wager that in the end,
###1599 the truth, told well enough is a good thing.
###1604 I call my book "The Bite in the Apple"
###1607 and not "out of the Apple" because I
###1608 wanted to recover wholeness of all that had been shattered.
###1612 
###1615 There are two trees at the beginning of the Bible.
###1618 One is the tree of knowledge of good and evil
###1621 and the other is the tree of life.
###1624 I wanted to put the bite back in the apple
###1626 and become the tree of life.
###1630 No more talking snakes, no more blaming woman
###1633 for the fall of man.
###1635 Writing this book was my choice to return
###1638 to my original spirit of wholeness
###1641 by way of my own work, which was mine alone to do.
###1644 
###1647 So now-- what time is it?
###1649 OK.
###1650 OK.
###1652 So now I want to talk about Steve's creativity.
###1655 You all know more than I do, as I said in the beginning,
###1658 about Steve Jobs' accomplishments.
###1660 But I have probably thought more about
###1662 how his early years shaped his creativity.
###1665 
###1667 I knew Steve was a genius when I first met him.
###1671 Though if you ask our daughter, she'll
###1672 complain that I think everyone is a genius.
###1676 I hear her referring to her mother's myths
###1679 and I think she worries I've fed her pretty lies.
###1683 She is like Steve.
###1685 She likes to get the facts straight.
###1687 But I absolutely know what I'm talking about.
###1690 I do believe everyone has genius in them.
###1694 One difference between Steve and most other people
###1697 is that he figured out what the work of his unique genius
###1701 was and he didn't allow himself to be distracted from it.
###1704 
###1707 He never gave up and he never forgot
###1710 that there was infinite potential
###1712 in a finite amount of time.
###1715 At the same time, I do feel he lost some sweetness--
###1719 the sweetness of life in the pursuit of all he accomplished.
###1723 
###1726 The time in which Steve and I came of age
###1728 was marked by disillusionment with our parents' value system.
###1732 The '50s were filled with the Cold War mentality,
###1735 superficial materialism as the answer to a fulfilled life
###1740 and also the inauthenticity of male and female role playing.
###1745 And we found ourselves rebels.
###1748 We were turning into rebels.
###1749 But we weren't rebels without a cause.
###1751 In fact, we felt that we should break the rules because they
###1754 were inadequate to the sense that there
###1757 was something bigger to be had.
###1759 In 1983, I talked a writer from "Time Magazine,"
###1763 who told me that when he interviewed Steve Wozniak's
###1766 and Steve Jobs' teachers in high school
###1769 after Apple had started to succeed,
###1774 he said that they all reported those years were
###1777 a rare time at the school in every area of study
###1781 because kids were so uncommonly creative and full
###1784 of self-authority.
###1787 That was that time.
###1790 Later, I spoke with an attorney who
###1791 went to a Catholic school in Santa Clara
###1794 at the same time Steve and I were at Homestead.
###1797 And he told me that his school was similarly
###1799 struck by some kind of fierce originality, that came and went
###1803 within a period of something like seven to 10 years.
###1806 Now I think what a crazy alchemy, LSD,
###1812 Eastern mysticism, the burgeoning technology of IBM,
###1816 the brute power of Lockheed, all coming up at the same time,
###1822 creating new combinations for re-envisioning design,
###1826 the value of aesthetics in technology,
###1829 planetary interconnectedness, and flower power.
###1834 I'm going to put this up.
###1837 This is another painting I did.
###1840 
###1845 Now I'm going to tell you a story that's
###1846 a part of Steve's past.
###1848 At first, it may not seem to connect
###1850 to the theme of this talk, creativity.
###1853 But you'll see why I think it does shortly.
###1855 But first, take a trip back to 1972.
###1858 The third time I met Steve's mother Clara Jobs,
###1861 I was standing alone in the living room waiting for Steve.
###1865 She came in and in an urgent way began telling me
###1868 that they had adopted Steve, but that the birth mother had taken
###1872 them to court because she didn't want
###1874 her son raised by the Jobs.
###1876 In 1955, Joanne Schieble, pregnant with Steve--
###1881 I actually don't know how to pronounce her name.
###1884 My apologies-- had chosen a family that was well educated,
###1889 wealthy, and Catholic, for her baby.
###1891 But that couple decided that they wanted a girl.
###1895 So the adoption agency gave Steve
###1899 to Clara and Paul Jobs, who had none of those qualities.
###1904 Clara told me that they had to fight to keep him.
###1906 And then confessed that she had been
###1910 terrified to love Steve for the first six months of his life
###1914 for fear that they were going to take him away from her.
###1918 At that, she just stared at me.
###1920 And I saw in her face a deep, matter-of-fact guilt.
###1926 And then she told me that even after they
###1929 had won the case, when he was two years old
###1932 he was so difficult a child to parent
###1934 that she wanted to give him back to the agency.
###1938 And I think she may have been trying
###1940 to indicate a root cause to his cold side.
###1943 But that day I was totally clueless
###1946 and would be for some time because Steve
###1948 was very good to me.
###1949 Instead, I wondered why on Earth my new boyfriend's mother
###1955 was telling me so much personal information.
###1958 I was concerned about her and wondered
###1961 in a simple 17-year-old way if they
###1964 did come to love and cherish him.
###1967 Not long after that conversation with his mother,
###1970 Steve started warning me too.
###1973 He told me on a number occasions and in a number of ways,
###1979 he knew he was going to lose his humanity in the business world
###1982 when he grew up.
###1984 I didn't know what to think, starting
###1987 with was this something that men knew and worried about?
###1992 I also wondered, how did he know his future because I
###1996 had no sense for mine.
###2000 Back then, we were just young lovers.
###2003 We moved in together the summer before he
###2005 went to college, an idyllic setting,
###2010 where we fell more in love.
###2013 Then he left for Reed College and I
###2015 returned for my final year of high school.
###2019 Late that fall, Steve called and told me
###2022 he'd dropped out of Reed, but was
###2024 staying in Oregon to audit classes.
###2029 It's important to know here that the crucial aspect in resolving
###2033 the court case with Steve's birth mother
###2035 was that Paul and Clara agreed to send him to college.
###2042 In fact, it was the most crucial factor, maybe even the only,
###2047 in getting his biological mother to leave him in their home.
###2052 But Steve was deeply conflicted because he
###2055 was well aware of Paul's anger and discomfort
###2058 about spending so much money on his education.
###2062 Higher education wasn't a part of the Jobs' experience
###2066 or value system.
###2069 Nor, apparently, was it to keep their legal obligations
###2073 to the court and to the birth mother of their son.
###2077 At 17, Paul and Clara let Steve decide.
###2082 And he took things into its own hands
###2084 and started auditing courses that interested him.
###2088 I think it's instructive to look at what
###2091 happened when Steve dropped out of school.
###2094 Here we have a brilliant prince of a genius integrating
###2098 the values of his working class parents,
###2102 a guy who by any standard should've
###2104 been given higher education.
###2107 But instead rerouted himself for a different kind of emergence
###2111 into adulthood, so as not too impinge
###2114 or be a burden on these people whose feelings he cared about.
###2120 So there's three things I'm getting from this-- that I've
###2123 thought about with this.
###2125 One, it seems to me that the breach in the contract
###2129 was the beginning of a spiraling out of right order in the sense
###2137 that it modeled the dropping of right regard for Steve's
###2141 mother and the contract.
###2144 One might think it doesn't matter because it was so long
###2147 ago and they had put so much time in.
###2150 But dishonoring the mother and the agreement in a court of law
###2154 set a pattern, or it revealed one.
###2158 Two, if Paul and Clara had been paying for the classes,
###2163 they would have likely interfered,
###2165 or Steve would have interfered with himself,
###2168 of Steve's being so playful about his choices, dance,
###2173 calligraphy, and Shakespeare.
###2176 Reed College was after all known for its math and sciences,
###2180 which is why it was a good fit for Steve.
###2183 So the arts classes would have seemed
###2186 anomalous to his obvious intellectual talents.
###2192 Strike that.
###2193 I think-- anyway, strike that.
###2196 Three, after dropping out of school,
###2199 Steve stumbled around for a while and suffered.
###2203 Though he remained sweet and positive
###2205 in his nature during that searching time,
###2209 hitchhiking between the Bay Area and Portland,
###2212 he was like a bird on the wire.
###2215 And there was a deep rootlessness,
###2217 one might say homelessness in him,
###2219 as he tried to figure out what he
###2221 was going to do with his life.
###2224 I want you to know how hard that was for him.
###2227 I was there.
###2228 I saw it.
###2228 It was painful.
###2230 He was deeply worried about his life.
###2233 Also I was disenchanted with him.
###2237 So I was not of much help.
###2239 But I don't think there was anything anybody
###2241 could do for him.
###2243 He had to find his own way.
###2246 And yet he was finding his own way
###2249 by looking at all possible failure.
###2252 He knew there was something that was supposed to happen.
###2255 Because just as he had told me that he
###2258 was going to lose his humanity in the business world,
###2261 he also told me that there was something big that he was going
###2266 to do that would make him famous and wealthy.
###2270 He didn't know what it was.
###2272 And I feel that it was at that time
###2276 when he didn't know what he was going to do
###2280 and feared he might have missed it,
###2283 that I saw him become mean spirited and stare
###2287 future down-- good Freudian slip-- stare failure down.
###2295 And I feel this was the beginning of his leadership
###2299 development.
###2301 Calamity, or rather the flip side of calamity,
###2305 offers insight into the creative process.
###2308 There is something about how everything that gets
###2311 missed, gets tilled under, and then
###2314 grows up into something greater.
###2318 This is a truism I think we can all feel confidence in.
###2323 Like things don't get missed.
###2325 They go back under and find other ways to come back up.
###2329 The irony, which is not the best word for what happened,
###2333 is that even though he did not go to school,
###2336 the personal computer is the tool that
###2340 in the not so distant future will enable a truly class world
###2345 education for every child on Earth, affordably so.
###2351 The lesson, never underestimate the power for failure.
###2357 It's a resource of immense untapped potential,
###2362 because everybody keeps trying to do things right.
###2366 The trauma of early childhood, the abandonment
###2369 by both mothers in the first six months,
###2373 probably had the most profound effect on Steve's creativity.
###2377 In fact, I don't think there's anything that ever happened
###2380 to him that he didn't end up using.
###2383 So how might Steve's adoption and the resulting attachment
###2386 disorder have affected his extremely sensitive creator
###2391 self to make him a natural part of the development
###2394 of a technology that will connect the world?
###2398 In musing over this, I leaped to the idea
###2401 that because Steve did not know what
###2403 real connection with a mother was
###2407 at such an important developmental stage,
###2409 that he became a part of inventing
###2412 a new kind of connection.
###2414 Trauma can cut people down.
###2417 But it could also wake people up.
###2421 Some part of Steve woke up when you
###2423 he separated from his birth mother-- I mean I think so--
###2427 and after that, because his adoptive mother didn't embrace
###2430 him for six months, I think he was stuck,
###2434 mobilized, wired, and focused to look for connection,
###2439 at the same time not understand what he was looking for.
###2443 This is my personal experience with him as well.
###2447 And when we consider how technology is more and more
###2452 replacing face-to-face, intimate contact,
###2455 I wonder if there isn't something of his attachment
###2460 disorder built right into the technology itself.
###2463 
###2466 Before this amazing techie world we exist in,
###2471 I was around to see how Woz and Steve related to each other.
###2477 The two geniuses, three years apart in age,
###2480 met regularly as friends do and talked over
###2483 their most recent ideas and discoveries.
###2487 I didn't know what they were talking about
###2489 and I didn't care.
###2490 Instead, I loved watching the acceleration
###2493 of their exchanges, the bright, happy flow,
###2495 the shock of the new.
###2497 They seemed to be very animated, jump up and down,
###2500 talk over and around each other, in Paul's garage
###2503 and other places too.
###2504 It was like a duet of a great affection.
###2507 Sometimes they could barely get their words out fast enough,
###2511 finishing each other's sentences and laughing
###2513 to acknowledge all that did not need
###2515 to be said, because as Steve might say,
###2518 insanely great minds think alike.
###2521 Yet as true as that was, sometimes it
###2524 went over the edge for me because there
###2526 was something else going on.
###2528 I'd forgotten about this other thing until I started writing.
###2533 Their speech patterns could be so rapid fire, their tones
###2537 so shrill, that it was as disturbing
###2539 as fingernails on a blackboard.
###2542 And I'm not exaggerating.
###2544 It was awful.
###2547 When the memory of this weirdness
###2548 came back to me when I was writing my book,
###2552 it occurred to me that something about how they were relating
###2557 may well have been the beginning of what would later
###2560 be coined the "reality distortion field" because it
###2564 felt like something being torn out of coherence.
###2568 As I say, it wasn't always this way, but just at those
###2571 times when the sounds were so unbearable
###2574 that I'd get myself out of hearing range.
###2577 Often I'd sit in the living room at the Jobs's and wait
###2580 for it to be over.
###2581 And I did not ask myself why or what it was, but I do now.
###2587 I think the technology has a double edge of both connecting
###2591 and disconnecting people to and from each other, Steve
###2595 and Steve, with a double edged sword that
###2597 connected and disconnected things at the same time.
###2600 Do we know what they were doing?
###2602 Do they know what they were doing?
###2604 I think we need to be more conscious and intense
###2607 about asking what the technology is doing to us, biologically,
###2611 emotionally, intellectually, and spiritually, creating
###2615 a serious, serious business.
###2617 
###2623 Many people who came of age before the personal computer
###2626 can remember such an extraordinary sense of beauty
###2630 and potential in the air in the '60s and '70s
###2633 and wonder what happened to all that promise.
###2637 Anybody, like over 50, might remember this.
###2640 You can ask them.
###2641 They may have this memory.
###2642 
###2645 Did something truly over the top remarkable
###2647 open up and then fail in some important way
###2650 to fulfill itself?
###2652 I live in Monterrey County right now.
###2655 In the romantic history of Cannery Row and Steinbeck,
###2659 there came a time when there were
###2661 no more sardines in the sea.
###2664 The industry was fished out and had closed down.
###2667 And all the people who make their livelihoods off
###2670 that industry were greatly alarmed
###2672 and asked where did the sardines go?
###2675 It was as if they were looking into the wine-dark sea,
###2679 unable to see the bleeding obvious.
###2681 The answer came by way of one Ed Ricketts, a scientist,
###2686 a philosopher, a early ecologist, and a friend
###2692 of Steinbeck, Henry Miller, and Joseph Campbell.
###2696 He was a remarkable guy by all accounts.
###2699 And he simply said, "they're in the cans."
###2702 I believe the extraordinary vision
###2704 that so many felt in the '60s and '70s
###2708 got absorbed into the computer age, a kind of can if you will,
###2713 so much mental, an intricate kind of can.
###2717 And now I know I'm singing to the choir.
###2722 I perceive I'm singing to the choir.
###2724 So I'll just continue.
###2727 I believe that we need new visions now.
###2729 We upped the game with the computer.
###2730 But I think it's taken up too much space in our imaginations,
###2734 to the point of flattening them.
###2736 There's too much focus on screens, on function,
###2739 and on transaction.
###2741 I feel we need to swing back to free up our imaginations
###2745 for new kinds of questions, more balanced, with greater
###2748 attention to integrity and nature
###2751 and value of face-to-face intimacy of our humanness.
###2756 I think a lot of people are haunted by Steve.
###2759 His creativity was so over the top
###2763 that I hear many question with anguish,
###2765 what would Steve Jobs have done?
###2768 What would he have gone on to create had he lived longer.
###2772 And I want to say, I don't think this is the right question.
###2776 His death is really sad.
###2781 And he boggled the imagination of so many
###2785 around the whole world.
###2787 And yet if we want to show appreciation for all he did,
###2794 why not take the best of his example
###2796 as inspiration to ask new kinds of questions of one's self,
###2803 for new kinds of frontiers?
###2806 He was a unique contributor.
###2808 And he got a remarkable ball up into the air.
###2811 Yet I think we need other kinds of balls in air now too.
###2817 A good question is a very powerful thing.
###2820 Once it's been asked, the genius inside,
###2823 the person who asked it of themself, or heard it asked,
###2828 will work day and night, through their
###2830 conscious and unconscious, to answer it.
###2834 I mean if Jesus said of his own remarkable life,
###2837 "this and more shall you do," then
###2840 I think we have a directive to be mindful and imaginative--
###2845 why are we imaginative about the truth of everyone's
###2851 creative capacity, not just potential,
###2854 but a person's individual imperative.
###2857 I think people are haunted by Steve Jobs
###2861 not quite because of what he accomplished.
###2865 But because he tapped into a level of creativity in himself
###2872 in such a significant way that it suggests
###2876 this too is possible.
###2878 This is where it's haunted.
###2879 
###2893 I believe his creativity is at least
###2896 as great as the computer, at least.
###2900 Steve Jobs was enlightened.
###2903 He was what enlightenment looks like in a business context.
###2908 And yet because he never received the love of a mother
###2911 when he was so young, he was an example
###2915 of harnessing an awakened state without being emotionally
###2919 integrated.
###2920 This is quite a combination.
###2923 And though he didn't do so badly,
###2927 it does give us a clue into why he did not
###2930 spearhead a new level of ecological
###2935 and compassionate best business practices around the world
###2939 when he, of all people, was so inspired
###2942 and in a position to do so.
###2945 One of the pillars of enlightenment is self love.
###2948 And I think that bereft of the real heart connection
###2952 with both mothers when it mattered,
###2954 that Steve just kept building wealth to compensate.
###2958 I'm not looking for blame.
###2960 But I'm thinking more in terms of an agreed upon course
###2964 correction into the future of technology.
###2968 My impression is that the technology
###2971 needs to be redesigned so that it works more harmoniously
###2975 with the human energy system.
###2977 I don't mean ergonomics.
###2979 I'm talking about the development
###2980 of the harmonics of the technology
###2983 for the full dimension of our humanness.
###2986 We all know a day spent on the computer
###2989 can give us a feeling of a day lost,
###2991 or I think we feel that way-- I'm talking for everybody--
###2995 somehow gone unlived, even if we got a lot done.
###3001 There's an emptiness and an emotional flatness.
###3005 It's as if we're making new forms all the time
###3009 and the brilliance is uncontestable.
###3011 But are we evolving and enriching
###3013 our humanness and human experience?
###3017 For example, here's an idea.
###3019 And I'm almost finished.
###3020 
###3024 Consider the cell phone as the new cigarette.
###3028 Its energy is gray and graying.
###3030 People go off by themselves to use it.
###3033 They reach for it unthinkingly as a distraction,
###3035 with the same regularity.
###3037 It's addictive and it lights up.
###3041 So here we have an example of wanting
###3043 to connect while the behavior actually blocks connection.
###3049 In my imagination, I think that a company, one at the cutting
###3053 edge of the market into the future of technology,
###3057 they'd hire an unusual kind of workforce
###3060 to start figuring out how to make the technology
###3063 work with our biological, emotional, intellectual,
###3066 and spiritual constitutions.
###3069 OK, two more paragraphs.
###3071 Our machines are cool.
###3073 And thanks to Steve's exquisite sensibility and insistence,
###3077 they are more beautiful than ever.
###3079 But I think we are too impressed.
###3082 They're supposed to serve us.
###3085 We should not be serving them-- we
###3087 should not serve them, nor pattern after them,
###3090 nor be entrained by them.
###3092 The technology is powerful.
###3095 But the discernment is that it's only
###3098 as good as the person who uses it being
###3101 responsible to their own unique heart vision.
###3106 And so I want to read something from my Henry Miller days.
###3114 
###3117 a quote.
###3120 And since he wasn't just a little sexist,
###3122 I've changed a few pronouns.
###3125 We live in a different time now.
###3127 He said, every day we slaughter our finest impulses.
###3131 That's why we get a heartache when
###3133 we read those lines written by the hand of a master
###3138 and recognize them as our own, as the tender shoots which
###3142 we stifled because we lacked the faith
###3145 to believe in our own powers and our own criteria of truth
###3149 and beauty.
###3150 Every man and woman, when she gets quiet
###3153 and when she becomes desperately honest with herself,
###3157 is capable of uttering profound truths.
###3161 We all derive from the same source.
###3164 There's no mystery about the origin of things.
###3168 We are all part of creation, all royalty, all poets,
###3172 all musicians.
###3174 We have only to open up and discover what's in here.
###3178 [APPLAUSE]
###3180 
###3184 AUDIENCE: I want to revisit some of what you shared,
###3187 both at the end and about your process in writing this book.
###3192 And in particular-- so within Google
###3195 we're a company creating software
###3197 that people are using, even in particular around
###3201 like authoring.
###3203 So I'm curious, given some of the things
###3205 that you had highlighted about sort a greater, like a greater
###3210 connection to our humanity in terms of how we use computers
###3215 for expression, for authoring, and some of the things that you
###3219 had mentioned early on around approaching the book
###3223 and writing cinematically, and a lot of the reflection that
###3225 took place for you around steering
###3227 this kind of middle course between extremes, I'm curious,
###3231 do you see like ways that tools could
###3233 be improved to support the kind of authoring-- to support you
###3237 in the processes you went through
###3240 for like another kind of expression?
###3242 CHRISANN BRENNAN: I feel-- this is out there--
###3245 but I feel it needs to be bumped up to a whole other level.
###3250 
###3254 Now, is all this function.
###3256 
###3262 I mean that's another good question.
###3264 And it's going to ring through me because there's
###3266 no way I can quite answer that.
###3268 And also I'm tremendously grateful for the tools that
###3271 are because it was remarkable what I was able to do.
###3276 I don't have an idea-- my biggest idea is
###3280 that the energetics of the computer
###3284 needs to be a higher frequency so that it's not cutting off--
###3291 OK, so this is what I think.
###3294 I think the computer is cutting people off from their hearts.
###3299 I think it's cutting them off from maybe
###3302 even the reason they came here.
###3305 If it's cutting off their hearts and their hearts
###3307 have the reasons they came here, like their own destiny.
###3311 So what I would like to see just a gifted workforce who
###3320 can come in and who know multiple levels
###3324 of possibilities and can design consciousness.
###3330 It's weird.
###3331 Because I don't really want computers to be babies,
###3334 like new life forms.
###3336 But still, I would like the computers--
###3339 I know that there are people-- and some of you
###3343 could easily, probably have that in you.
###3350 It's a calling.
###3352 It's something that you're not-- only by magic and accident
###3361 do you get trained for.
###3363 So in terms of the functionality of how the computer can help
###3374 remarkable people be more creative, I have no comment.
###3379 I feel like the design of the machine itself needs to be-- I
###3389 don't even know what words-- redone.
###3390 AUDIENCE: Maybe transformed.
###3391 CHRISANN BRENNAN: Yeah.
###3392 AUDIENCE: To pick up on some of the themes you mentioned--
###3394 I mean I appreciated the analogy you gave around like a cell
###3398 phone as the kind of like modern cigarette.
###3400 When you're standing in line, it's
###3402 a way to sort of pass the time.
###3404 CHRISANN BRENNAN: Good, good one.
###3405 I should add that.
###3406 AUDIENCE: Yeah.
###3406 And it's somewhat ironic because it's a device for communication
###3409 and we use it for like disconnection, a disconnection
###3412 from ourselves, a disconnection from the people around us.
###3416 In terms of some of what you had just
###3418 been mentioning, the way that computers and technology is
###3421 conceptualized right now, it's very
###3423 much around kind of spectacle and sort
###3425 of what we see, seeing new things.
###3428 And it sounds like I was hearing you
###3430 get at how there may be possibilities around supporting
###3434 a kind of reflection or introspection,
###3438 like arriving at insights kind of internally.
###3440 I'm curious if that's something that you're also
###3443 envisioning as a possibility there
###3444 CHRISANN BRENNAN: Well, it's an interesting thing.
###3446 I mean the furthest I've gone with it is that people need
###3450 time to be reflective with the human energy system.
###3453 It's already so much-- it's light years ahead of anything
###3456 we can do with the computer.
###3458 So in terms of using the computer,
###3462 I think it's a problem.
###3463 
###3469 That's exactly where the problem is--
