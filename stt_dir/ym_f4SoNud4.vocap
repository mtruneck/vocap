###19 DAVID: I'm David Chang.
###20 We're going to the mean streets of K-Town.
###22 [LAUGHTER]
###24 
###28 DAVID: I got into this profession because there's
###30 something honest about getting better every day.
###32 Like, OK, my knife skills aren't very good here but, use
###36 it every day.
###36 And after a year or two you can start to see progression.
###39 
###46 I spent time at the Mercer kitchen, worked at a variety
###49 of little establishment in Tokyo.
###52 Spent some time at Cafe Boulud under Andrew Carmellini.
###55 There was a variety of things that led to me leaving.
###59 I was having a hard time keeping up with the rest of
###61 the crew at Cafe Boulud.
###62 It sort of reminded me that I wasn't that great.
###66 The cooks around me were all more talented.
###70 And ultimately I would always look at Andrew Carmellini and
###73 be like, I'm never going to be as good as him.
###76 
###79 PETER: What's the awareness of Momofuku among the
###81 Korean-American population here?
###83 DAVID: Do you see me hanging out with
###84 Korean Americans much?
###86 SUE: They love you.
###88 Every single day I have like 10 requests from a fucking
###91 Korean newspaper--
###92 the third largest Korean newspaper.
###94 DAVID: I needed to challenge myself.
###96 I thought opening a restaurant would be the ultimate test to
###102 see if I could just do it.
###103 And that was really the first goal.
###105 Can I open it up?
###106 Didn't really think about the food I was going to serve.
###109 I knew I wanted to do a noodle bar, and that was
###112 the extent of it.
###114 This spot was the first restaurant.
###116 This was the original noodle bar.
###118 And now this is transformed to Momofuku Ko.
###121 And we have Ssam Bar on 13th and Second, and Milk Bar.
###125 And yeah, shit, just a lot.
###129 We are on the corner of 32nd and 5th.
###132 We're going to Mad for Chicken.
###135 We're here with our good friend, Peter Meehan,
###138 co-author of our cookbook.
###140 And Sue Chan works at our office at Momofuku.
###145 So that's it.
###148 [MUSIC-- THE DIRTY FENCES]
###169 SUE CHAN: Oh my god, what's this?
###172 What the hell is that?
###173 DAVID: Beer.
###176 SUE: Oh my god.
###179 DAVID: When I lived in Korea, you could get the mini liter,
###182 or like the huge liter.
###183 You just try to drink it as fast as possible.
###187 PETER: Wow.
###188 DAVID: That's just fucking great.
###190 I feel like I'm in Korea.
###192 This is so Korean it's insane.
###194 I am the worst type of chef, I guess.
###198 I don't like to go out to eat to fancy restaurant, or
###200 restaurants in general.
###202 Why did they give us the non-chicken menu?
###204 I can't find any chicken.
###206 Oh, there, on the front page.
###209 I'm dumb.
###210 PETER: Mad for wings, mad for drums, mad for combo.
###211 DAVID: I think we go combo.
###213 What I want to eat, personally, is straightforward
###216 stuff, something that's assuming, and you can go to,
###219 and there's no bullshit.
###220 There's no pretense.
###221 You're just going to eat.
###222 Can we get a mad for combo?
###224 Hot and spicy.
###226 SUE: Notice his nice voice?
###228 DAVID: Sue's leaving soon.
###230 I don't know, Chinese food sort of hits the spot.
###233 Or Asian food, or Korean Town.
###236 
###239 I want to have a successful restaurant group.
###242 I want our employees to do well.
###244 I want them to have the creative freedom to express
###246 themselves.
###247 I want a lot of different things.
###250 But I'm not necessarily too thrilled with the baggage that
###253 comes with it.
###253 We were open.
###254 And we didn't get reviewed for eight months.
###258 I was like, man, we must really
###260 fucking suck, or something.
###262 We did suck.
###263 So it was terrible.
###266 The food was fucking bad.
###268 Because we were just learning how to run a restaurant.
###271 I was trying to figure how to run a cash register.
###275 PETER: The first time I went to Momofuku I
###276 fucking hated it.
###277 I went back later on when they got better.
###280 I had heard they were getting better.
###281 And I had a great meal, and then had three
###284 or four great meals.
###285 And then I wrote the review.
###287 DAVID: And I was trying to figure out who this fucking
###290 Peter Meehan dude was.
###292 Because you always want to spot the critics.
###293 PETER: I was eating at Momofuku every Saturday with
###297 Mark Bittman, who was the guy I used to work for.
###299 He had written about Dave.
###301 And at some point he was like, I'm telling Dave who you are.
###304 And I was like, OK, whatever.
###305 You already gone on to such great heights of fame that I
###308 know I could never sully your reputation
###311 with my byline again.
###312 And it was very awkward and fast, how you want if if
###316 you're a restaurant reviewer.
###317 DAVID: You guys ordered grits and pig tails.
###319 And I think I might have been hungover.
###321 PETER: Quite possibly.
###323 DAVID: And that was it.
###324 I was like, you're fucking Meehan?
###326 I was like, you're the guy.
###328 PETER: Then there was a point at which Dave was getting
###330 bombarded with offers to do a cookbook
###332 from agents and authors.
###334 We were having dinner at Ssam Bar, actually with Mark
###337 Bittman again.
###338 And he was like, well you're not going to be
###339 this popular forever.
###340 So you better cash in quick, and do
###342 this as soon as possible.
###344 And Chang was like, well if people do it with me.
###348 DAVID: I had no idea.
###349 Everyone wanted to write a fucking book.
###350 And I was just like, that's news to me.
###353 PETER: You were less interested in doing a book of
###355 recipes than in kind of getting the story down of the
###362 wild and early years of Momofuku.
###367 And I was more interested in the recipes, because I have to
###369 pay for food at Momofuku.
###371 So being able to make it home seemed
###372 like it might be cheaper.
###373 So I get a little bit.
###374 You get a little bit.
###375 In the end, no one's happy?
###377 DAVID: Yeah, basically.
###381 This is amazing.
###382 Look how crispy this motherfucker is.
###384 SUE: Smells good.
###385 
###391 PETER: These fries are fucking wet bullshit.
###392 But this is good chicken.
###395 SUE: This is spicy.
###396 Woo.
###397 DAVID: Are you Asian, really?
###400 SUE: Are we doing this?
###401 DAVID: Can you handle it?
###403 SUE: Fuck you.
###404 Can Pete Meehan handle this?
###406 DAVID: No, he's Irish.
###407 
###413 [MUSIC-- THE DIRTY FENCES]
###415 PETER: We're going to go down to Second Avenue.
###417 SUE: Oh, Second and 13th, please.
###418 Ssam Bar!
###419 DAVID: Yeah, 13th Street and Second Avenue.
###421 
###427 SUE: Yes, tell him to come.
###428 
###432 DAVID: We're going to Ssam Bar.
###435 SUE: Momofuku Ssam Bar.
###435 DAVID: It's this overrated fucking restaurant.
###438 [MUSIC-- THE DIRTY FENCES]
###443 SUE: Dave, are you OK with cooking tonight, by the way?
###445 DAVID: Yeah, that's not happening.
###447 SUE: No?
###448 
###465 JOSE: David Chang.
###466 
###470 DAVID: He's the fucking man.
###471 That is Chef Jose Andres.
###473 He's the chef at Jaleo Zaytinya in Washington, DC.
###477 He also has an award winning restaurant in Los Angeles
###480 called the Bazaar at the SLS.
###483 He's incredibly influential.
###485 And it's a pleasure to have him here.
###486 It's a total surprise.
###487 
###493 Late night is something that we're trying
###494 to do at Ssam Bar.
###497 And sometimes it turns out to be craziness.
###500 It's about time we fucking show the Spaniard how to make
###504 fucking ham.
###507 MALE SPEAKER: This is the Benton's.
###510 And the eggs.
###512 DAVID: That's OK.
###513 Thank you, Fanny, for educating the
###515 Spanish how to make ham.
###517 
###524 DAVID: China, whatever?
###525 China makes some of the best ham in the world.
###529 [GROANS]
###530 JOSE: Can I finish my statement, please?
###532 
###539 And it's unbelievably good.
###542 You are sick.
###544 DAVID: I know.
###544 JOSE: I couldn't believe you came up with this thing.
###546 
###553 DAVID: I was reading the Jose Andres cookbook.
###554 JOSE: And it's amazing.
###556 DAVID: It inspired me.
###558 JOSE: Before I taste it I was like, this guy is insane.
###561 He's a nice kid, but--
###562 
###566 and then it's good.
###568 DAVID: It works, right?
###569 It works.
###570 Weirdly enough it works.
###571 Looting.
###572 Here's to fucking burning and looting.
###576 That's a Bob Marley song.
###577 I have no idea.
###579 I'm drunk.
###582 We're at Momofuku Ssam Bar.
###584 And I'm making pork buns.
###587 And this has become a signature dish at this
###589 restaurant.
###590 I think we probably sell between all the restaurants
###592 maybe 300, 400 a day.
###595 Even though I haven't made a pork bun in quite a while, I
###599 will still say I think I make more pork buns than most
###602 people will on this planet.
###604 You've had Wonder Bread before.
###606 So imagine Wonder Bread without it being cooked in an
###610 oven, and it being steamed instead.
###614 Sauce is Hoisin, which translates to--
###619 I have no fucking idea anymore.
###622 SUE: It's got sesame, salt.
###624 
###629 DAVID: It's a couple teaspoons of salt, and some black
###635 pepper, and a couple hours of don't fucking worry about it.
###639 
###649 DAVID: Chef Jose Andres, one of the greatest chefs in
###652 America is giving me shit.
###654 And I'm cool with that.
###656 Put the belly on some sea folds.
###659 And that's what you'd have.
###661 Pork buns.
###662 This is not how we really serve it.
###664 SUE: This is just when Dave is alone here at Ssam Bar in the
###667 middle of the night at 2:00 in the morning.
###669 This is how he treats himself right.
###671 
###674 DAVID: What's your favorite thing you eat before you go to
###676 bed while you're fucking drunk as shit?
###679 What are you going to say?
###680 Ox tail, fucking bone marrow?
###684 Bullshit.
###685 It's that fucking crappy ass piece of pizza that you ate.
###688 And you don't even fucking remember that you ate.
###690 
###699 Usually it's like, that's weird.
###702 I just vomited something this morning that I
###703 don't remember I ate.
