the food truck.


212
0:7:20,93 --> 0:7:24,12
They've done Filipino-Taqueria
fusion.


213
0:7:24,12 --> 0:7:27,39
Instead of carne asada, they put
in Sisig as replacement.


214
0:7:27,39 --> 0:7:28,1
And it's been a hit, man.


215
0:7:28,1 --> 0:7:29,61
EDDIE HUANG: I'm down
with people


216
0:7:29,61 --> 0:7:31,37
taking my Filipino food.


217
0:7:31,37 --> 0:7:34,57
You know what, I think people
will be more receptive to it


218
0:7:34,57 --> 0:7:39,77
if it's in a taco, or
if it's in a bow.


219
0:7:39,77 --> 0:7:42,29
If that's what has to happen for
people to actually start


220
0:7:42,29 --> 0:7:43,72
to experience our food.


221
0:7:43,72 --> 0:7:47,9
That's great, but that is kind
of sad part that people won't


222
0:7:47,9 --> 0:7:48,775
just eat our food as is.


223
0:7:48,775 --> 0:7:49,75
Do you know what I mean?


224
0:7:49,75 --> 0:7:53,5
But then on the converse, my mom
and my grandparents, they


225
0:7:53,5 --> 0:7:55,15
weren't the most receptive
to other cultures' food.


226
0:7:55,15 --> 0:7:57,62
So it's not intrinsic
to America either.


227
0:7:57,62 --> 0:8:0,6
I think our generation, it's
is our job to break the


228
0:8:0,6 --> 0:8:5,555
barriers and get people outside
their comfort zone.


229
0:8:5,555 --> 0:8:11,14
Finally, after multiple tries,
the Taqueria Cancun burrito.


230
0:8:11,14 --> 0:8:14,4
Even in this state, a burrito
palate fatigue.


231
0:8:14,4 --> 0:8:15,81
I'd eat two of these joints.


232
0:8:15,81 --> 0:8:17,1
Nice tortilla.


233
0:8:17,1 --> 0:8:19,45
There's a little bit of even
flakiness to this tortilla,


234
0:8:19,45 --> 0:8:20,94
because it was on the griddle.


235
0:8:20,94 --> 0:8:23,43
I think that this carnitas
can't be topped.


236
0:8:23,43 --> 0:8:25,47
This is one of the best carnitas
I've ever had.


237
0:8:25,47 --> 0:8:27,5
I liked Farolito the best,
but all three of them had


238
0:8:27,5 --> 0:8:28,8
something different.


239
0:8:28,8 --> 0:8:34,26
Taqueria had a very nice size,
very easy, it was an unwieldy.


240
0:8:34,26 --> 0:8:37,39
This one, I think, might
have the best protein.


241
0:8:37,39 --> 0:8:41,2
It's tender and delicious, very
moist, packs a punch.


242
0:8:41,2 --> 0:8:44,169
But overall, as a package,
I think El Farolito.


243
0:8:44,169 --> 0:8:45,72
Just enough, man.


244
0:8:45,72 --> 0:8:48,1
It's a very balanced
hand that they're


245
0:8:48,1 --> 0:8:49,16
cooking with over there.


246
0:8:49,16 --> 0:8:51,16
To me that's hands
down, numero uno.


247
0:8:51,16 --> 0:8:52,66
Alright?


248
0:8:52,66 --> 0:8:55,361
Just so you know, you got a lot
of spots on the camera.


249
0:8:55,361 --> 0:8:55,924
CAMERAMAN: Yeah, I know.


250
0:8:55,924 --> 0:8:56,94
I can't even see it.


251
0:8:56,94 --> 0:8:58,11
[SLAP SOUND]


252
0:8:58,11 --> 0:8:59,16
EDDIE HUANG: You know
what's funny?


253
0:8:59,16 --> 0:9:2,16
In New York we'd shit on
something in a mini mall.


254
0:9:2,16 --> 0:9:8,21
We'd shit on being next to
the Karaoke Depot, or the


255
0:9:8,21 --> 0:9:9,29
laundromat, and the dental.


256
0:9:9,29 --> 0:9:13,35
I mean, this doesn't look like
some ill, [INAUDIBLE]


257
0:9:13,35 --> 0:9:14,2
OG culture.


258
0:9:14,2 --> 0:9:17,1
It's not something that New
Yorkers would bug over, but


259
0:9:17,1 --> 0:9:21,6
you start to realize there's
some real shit here.


260
0:9:21,6 --> 0:9:23,41
It looks different.


261
0:9:23,41 --> 0:9:27,76
The symptoms of culture that
you should be up on are


262
0:9:27,76 --> 0:9:29,58
different in Cali than
they are in New York.


263
0:9:29,58 --> 0:9:32,62
So it's fun to kind of discover
the new language,


264
0:9:32,62 --> 0:9:35,84
where I can't just roll by a
mini-mart and assume it's


265
0:9:35,84 --> 0:9:37,406
going to suck.


266
0:9:37,406 --> 0:9:41,11
But San Francisco, I got to say
man, it's got a lot of the


267
0:9:41,11 --> 0:9:42,67
things that I love
about the city.


268
0:9:42,67 --> 0:9:45,63
There's a lot niche culture.


269
0:9:45,63 --> 0:9:48,45
There's a lot of alternative
things going on.


270
0:9:48,45 --> 0:9:50,89
But they know how to
relax out here.


271
0:9:50,89 --> 0:9:53,79
It's definitely something that
I need to learn how to do.


272
0:9:53,79 --> 0:9:57,9
So, we fresh off the boat
and we out motherfucker.


273
0:9:57,9 --> 0:11:57,9
