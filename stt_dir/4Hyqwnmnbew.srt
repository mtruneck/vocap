1
0:0:10,7 --> 0:0:17,15
If you go to the Cairo Museum and you look at the artefacts, go to the Golden Mask.


2
0:0:17,15 --> 0:0:22,85
The golden mask is something that, I believe, it will never be repeated.


3
0:0:22,85 --> 0:0:27,5
No artist in the world will be able to do this beauty.


4
0:0:27,5 --> 0:0:34,5
Look at the eyes, at the face, it is a masterpiece of art, in my opinion.


5
0:0:34,5 --> 0:0:39,65
The second, go to the coffins. You know, they found inside the tomb seven coffins.


6
0:0:39,65 --> 0:0:45,15
Howard Carter took all of them and he left one inside the tomb.


7
0:0:45,15 --> 0:0:51,85
Each coffin can give you an amazing the beauty of art.


8
0:0:51,85 --> 0:0:59,65
Not only anything in the tomb is an exact copy of the face of King Tut.


9
0:0:59,65 --> 0:1:7,45
Some of what you discover in the tomb, it shows the idealistic life


10
0:1:7,45 --> 0:1:11,65
that he wants to be, it is not really the realistic art.


11
0:1:11,65 --> 0:1:18,45
And therefore you'll find that some of the statues are different from each other.


12
0:1:18,45 --> 0:1:23,65
I myself, when I enter Cairo Museum, I go to this chair.


13
0:1:23,65 --> 0:1:26,65
And I look at it, the Golden Throne.


14
0:1:26,65 --> 0:1:30,65
The golden throne is another masterpiece.


15
0:1:30,65 --> 0:1:38,15
The most amazing thing that they show at the statue the love between the king and the queen.


16
0:1:38,15 --> 0:1:45,15
They're wearing one sandal only, they show that they're sharing everything.


17
0:1:45,15 --> 0:1:47,15
The love was between them.


18
0:1:47,15 --> 0:1:50,15
And this why, when King Tut died,


19
0:1:50,15 --> 0:1:57,45
Queen Ankhesenamun was so upset she put a flower,


20
0:1:57,45 --> 0:2:1,15
it was discovered on his mummy.


21
0:2:1,15 --> 0:2:7,55
The jewellery is amazing, especially what has been found inside his body,


22
0:2:7,55 --> 0:2:18,55
over 104 pieces: beautiful rings, collars with beads, the crown.


23
0:2:18,55 --> 0:2:27,5
My best, favourite piece is really that pectoral with winged scarab.


24
0:2:27,5 --> 0:2:30,5
Look why – this is amazing.


25
0:2:30,5 --> 0:2:37,15
The stones here, you have gold and silver and glass and semi-precious stones


26
0:2:37,15 --> 0:2:41,15
– all these are in one piece of jewelery.


27
0:2:41,15 --> 0:2:49,15
Look at this scarab in the middle and holding the udjat – eye.


28
0:2:49,15 --> 0:2:52,5
And this is a symbol of Osiris.


29
0:2:52,5 --> 0:2:57,85
The two cobras protecting the king in between.


30
0:2:57,85 --> 0:3:2,65
And down – look at the lotus flower.


31
0:3:2,65 --> 0:3:8,65
This is, in my opinion, a masterpiece.


32
0:3:8,65 --> 0:3:12,65
How? It has a religious idea.


33
0:3:12,65 --> 0:5:12,65
Art in Ancient Egypt was for the sake of religion.
