###0 STEVE SPANGLER: You know, Fourth of July used to be fun.
###1 But ever since the police ruined it by saying you can't
###4 light fireworks, I've had to come up with some new ideas
###7 for the huge crowd of people that come to my house every
###10 year looking for fun on the Fourth of July.
###12 I think you're going to like this.
###15 I'm Steve Spangler.
###16 And I'm all about making science fun.
###18 For the last 20 years, I've been teaching ways to turn
###21 ordinary science experiments into unforgettable learning
###24 experiences.
###25 I have an amazing team who will do whatever it takes to
###28 affect the way people think about science.
###30 And to do that, I live by one motto.
###33 Make it big.
###34 Do it right.
###35 Give it class.
###37 
###41 You know, nothing says Fourth of July more than red cups,
###44 right here, for soft drinks, of course.
###47 But I was thinking, why not for a little science
###50 experiment?
###50 So we're going to show you kind of a classic Spangler
###53 science experiment using red Solo cups and some dry ice.
###57 All right, for the first step, you've got to put
###58 a hole in the cup.
###59 So we want a hole right here.
###60 And probably the easiest way to do that is to just use an
###63 Exacto knife or some sort of knife and just kind of start
###66 to cut in just a little bit if you want.
###69 And finish this up with a pair of scissors.
###71 So we're just going to cut a little hole in the cup.
###74 It doesn't have to look pretty.
###77 This isn't Martha Stewart hour.
###78 I'm just putting a hole in a cup.
###81 Look at that.
###82 Magic, right there.
###83 Hole in a cup.
###85 Step two, Saran Wrap.
###87 You need a hunk of Saran Wrap.
###90 That's OK.
###90 Really, they make it so easy to get it right out of this
###92 container right here.
###93 Just follow their directions.
###95 It's perfectly fine.
###96 You just need to kind of put this in here like this and
###98 just kind of pull it.
###100 Pull it across like--
###101 it's pretty easy to get this out.
###104 You just need a small piece.
###106 So we're just going to use a small little
###108 chunk of Saran Wrap.
###110 And we'll use that up next time.
###112 And you're going to stretch it right over the top like this,
###114 kind of like a little drum.
###115 That's what you want.
###117 And a rubber band to secure the whole thing in place.
###123 And simply cut off the small little excess that
###125 you have over here.
###127 
###129 We're going to recycle this for later.
###132 Next comes the best part.
###133 And that is dry ice.
###135 So get yourself a little dry ice.
###137 Now, you've got to be careful, because it's 78 degrees below
###140 0 Fahrenheit, or 110 degrees below 0 Celsius.
###145 Regardless, it's really, really cold.
###146 So when you get dry ice, you're going to break it up
###149 into some small little pieces.
###150 And that's what we're looking for here are just a couple
###153 small pieces that will fit right into the little cup.
###157 Good.
###157 There's a little piece there.
###159 This is pretty good.
###161 This guy's looking good.
###162 Perfect.
###163 All right.
###164 See?
###164 There's our dry ice in the cup.
###166 The last part is you need a little bit of water.
###169 So take some water.
###170 You're going to pour the water into the hole.
###173 Because the dry ice is in there, we should get a little
###177 of that fog that starts to come out.
###180 That's perfect.
###181 Now, it may be too much.
###182 But this is the whole idea, is that you tap
###185 on the bottom here.
###185 And as you do that, it takes the air that's inside the cup
###188 and forces it out that hole.
###190 And that fast-moving air creates a little thing called
###193 Bernoulli's principle, which is just a little vortex ring
###195 that you get to see.
###195 Watch.
###197 Oh, these are looking good.
###199 Isn't that fantastic?
###201 So what can you do with these vortex rings?
###202 Well, you could stand around in the house
###204 all day and do this.
###205 Or you can invite friends over and do this.
###208 Or you could blow out a candle.
###211 That's been done.
###212 You can decide, let's make it bigger.
###215 Well, if the red cup is fun, that means this five-gallon
###217 bucket will even be better.
###219 And you just need to make some slight modifications to the
###222 five-gallon bucket and you'll have a
###224 perfect smoke ring launcher.
###226 And you need some tools.
###228 While you could try to just cut a hole in here, it's a
###230 little bit harder.
###230 That's why this little keyhole saw seems to do the trick.
###234 Watch this.
###235 
###243 Now you're the life of the party.
###245 We're going to modify the lid so that there's
###247 a ring that's left.
###248 Just invite your friends over early and
###250 tell them to do this.
###252 
###258 Perfect.
###259 
###261 Who said that wasn't going to be fun?
###264 So now we have a bucket that has a lid with a huge hole in
###268 it, and a bottom that doesn't hold anything.
###271 This is perfect for our science experiment.
###273 Now you need a shower curtain.
###275 I like to use these clear shower curtains.
###278 It's perfect.
###278 They're nice and durable, and they make
###281 the best little membrane.
###283 The object here is just to secure this
###286 piece of vinyl in place.
###287 While you could use bungees or something, this ring seems to
###290 work really, really well, especially if you have a
###294 little tool that will help hold it in place.
###297 It's called a hammer.
###298 [BANGING]
###303 If you don't like to blow smoke rings, just invite your
###304 friends over and listen to the song.
###307 [BANGING]
###308 Go for the smoke rings.
###311 Time to trim.
###312 Just cut off the excess all the way around to make it look
###316 nice and clean.
###317 And you'll have yourself the perfect smoke ring launcher.
###322 The bucket's not empty.
###323 It's actually filled with air.
###326 And that air can easily be pushed out.
###328 Now, you could take your hand and just push it this way.
###332 We want a way to be able to see the air.
###334 That's where this little device comes in.
###336 See, it's a smoke machine.
###338 Now, you can find them on sale right after Halloween.
###340 You just need a small little blast inside here to help
###343 color the air.
###344 
###348 See, that little bit of smoke that's inside there is exactly
###350 what you need, because when you tap on the bottom, watch
###353 what happens.
###355 There's your vortex.
###356 But unlike the cup, these go really, really far.
###360 You can hit them pretty hard.
###361 
###367 I know what you're thinking.
###367 You want something that's more patriotic.
###369 You want it bigger.
###370 You want it colored.
###371 You want it--
###373 I've got an idea.
###375 See, you've got all of this leftover shower curtain.
###377 Now you just need a bigger bucket.
###380 So you just take the rest of the shower curtain, and you
###382 put it right over the bucket like this.
###385 Now we have to secure it in place.
###387 That's where these bungee cords come in.
###391 Pull it down, stretch it tight.
###392 Now this is not just a smoke ring launcher.
###394 It's a patriotic smoke ring launcher.
###396 It's Fourth of July!
###398 See, this is the kind of activity that's going to make
###400 your neighbors proud.
###401 Nothing says America more than a giant trash can with a
###404 shower curtain stretched over the top and some bungee cords
###407 and a couple smoke bombs.
###411 That's right.
###411 I said smoke bombs.
###413 You can't just drop smoke bombs in the trash can.
###415 It'll shoot out molten smoke bomb stuff.
###418 And then all of a sudden the trash can's on fire.
###420 You've ruined the day.
###421 So I came up with this little idea.
###423 Now, you don't have to use this kind of paint can.
###426 You can use just an old coffee can.
###427 But we are going to make a smoker.
###429 
###433 See, we're just putting some holes in this little can so
###437 the smoke bomb can live in here and just have smoke come
###441 out and trap everything else inside.
###443 
###447 So how many holes?
###449 Just until the neighbors tell you to stop.
###452 All right.
###453 So here's the idea.
###454 See, the smoke bomb goes down inside like this.
###456 And now you light it.
###458 Perfect.
###459 And now this goes on top.
###461 And it just keeps all of the shards from coming out.
###466 And it just oozes smoke.
###467 
###470 This is the smoke ring launcher I've used in my act
###472 for almost 20 years.
###474 But I never use this kind of smoke on stage.
###476 Of course, we're just using a smoke machine.
###478 So this one, you just have to make sure that you cut the
###480 hole just a little bit bigger than the paint can so it
###484 covers it perfectly.
###486 All right.
###486 We're ready for patriotic rings of smoke.
###488 Smoke bomb down inside.
###491 Beautiful.
###492 Lid on top like this.
###494 Smoke starts to come out, you simply cover it up.
###497 See, this is the only way that you can get this beautifully
###499 colored smoke.
###500 This is perfect.
###501 Now watch.
###502 As it lifts up, watch this.
###506 You get these beautiful smoke rings.
###510 Wake the kids.
###511 Call the neighbors.
###512 Oh, wait.
###512 That's David Letterman.
###514 
###518 What if you could use science to help you serve
###519 food at your party?
###521 I got it.
###522 Watch this.
###523 And just because you've seen Mentos and Diet Coke does not
###525 mean that you've got to turn it off at this point.
###527 This is different.
###528 Watch.
###528 First of all, we need a dropper device.
###530 And I've got to show you this one.
###531 This is clear plastic so you can see what's going on.
###534 But watch this.
###534 There's a magnet that goes on the side here, and a ball
###537 bearing that comes down here.
###539 See how it holds in place like this?
###541 That's perfect.
###542 So when you pull, then everything falls at once.
###544 Next, the contraption goes on the top like this.
###548 And now we drop the Mentos.
###552 See, we're just hoping that that magnet and that ball
###555 bearing holds everything in place.
###556 And so far, so good.
###557 If we just pulled this right now, it'd be bad because it
###559 ruins the kitchen.
###560 That's why you need to make this simple little
###562 contraption, called the Super Soda Dispenser 3000.
###566 So you see, it just goes over the very top like this.
###569 And the last thing you need, six of your best friends.
###572 So you're going to have limit it to six, but these are my
###574 six best friends.
###575 Anybody else?
###577 FEMALE SPEAKER: This is it.
###578 MALE SPEAKER: This is it.
###579 I'm going to pull this.
###580 And it's going to drop down.
###582 And hopefully, this is how we're going to bring in this
###585 exciting time of the year.
###587 MALE SPEAKER: Rad.
###589 STEVE SPANGLER: Ready?
###590 
###593 Bam!
###593 FEMALE SPEAKER: Nice.
###594 STEVE SPANGLER: Look at that.
###595 It's a soda dispenser, and it's perfect.
###598 But you don't want to waste it all on one person.
###600 That's why we only give each person a little taste.
###603 Here you go.
###604 Some for you.
###605 And some for you.
###606 Cheers to science Fourth of July.
###608 FEMALE SPEAKER: Cheers!
###608 MALE SPEAKER: Cheers.
###611 STEVE SPANGLER: Well, now that you've got an awesome drink,
###613 and you've got all your friends here, and you've got
###615 smoke rings, you're ready for the big finale, patriotic
###617 geysers with all your friends.
###620 Where'd she go?
###622 MALE SPEAKER: She took off.
###623 
###625 STEVE SPANGLER: Well, here we are for the big finale.
###627 I set this up first thing this morning.
###629 And I've been waiting all day for it.
###630 You're going to want to get your phone out for this.
###634 I've got three different sodas.
###635 And I've colored this one red and this one white, of course.
###638 This is clear, and this one's blue.
###639 And now when I pull this, the Mentos are going to fall.
###642 And like every great geyser, it's going to
###644 shoot up in the air.
###644 It's going to be this patriotic kind of color of
###646 red, white, and blue.
###647 You're going to want to go--
###648 MALE SPEAKER: I've got to go.
###649 STEVE SPANGLER: No.
###649 Don't go.
###650 This is going to be awesome.
###651 I'm going to pull these strings, and it's going to be
###652 like in the sky.
###653 MALE SPEAKER: I've got to head out.
###655 Thanks for the soda.
###656 STEVE SPANGLER: You can pull a string if you want.
###658 Just take your camera.
###660 Watch this.
###660 It's going to be-- hey, watch this.
###661 It's really cool.
###662 Watch this.
###662 Watch.
###663 Three, two, one, go!
###665 Watch this!
###666 Ta da!
###667 Look at that !
###669 Happy Fourth of July, everyone!
###672 See, you missed it.
###674 It was awesome.
###676 This is the best year ever!
###678 Thanks for coming, everyone.
###681 Next year I'm going to do six geysers!
###683 Not just three, six.
###685 I'm going to have some more sodas and smoke rings.
###687 
###690 I don't know why he had to leave so early.
###691 
###694 Honey?
###696 Bring the kids out.
###697 I got more geysers.
###700 [MUSIC - JOHN PHILIP SOUSA, "THE

###702 
###715 The oldest trick in the book, ladies and gentlemen.
###717 Three pieces of dry ice and three Solo cups.
###720 One on the top.
###721 Boop, boop.
###721 Look at this.
###722 Goes right through.
###723 It's magic.
###723 But hey, I'll do it again.
###725 That's another piece of dry ice here, right on the top.
###728 Watch this.
###728 Boop, boop.
###729 And that thing goes right through it.
###731 Check that out.
###731 It's OK.
###732 I'm amazed myself.
###733 Watch this one.
###734 The third one is magic.
###735 It's going to go through this way.
###736 Bam, bam.
###737 Bam!
###739 Booyah!
