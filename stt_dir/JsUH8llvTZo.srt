ALISON SEVERS: In 1979, the
Soviet army entered


8
0:0:58,29 --> 0:1:2,45
Afghanistan, engaging in a
brutal 10-year conflict which


9
0:1:2,45 --> 0:1:5,14
kick-started the Afghan
opium trade.


10
0:1:5,14 --> 0:1:7,8
It was sold all over the world
to help fund the fight against


11
0:1:7,8 --> 0:1:10,88
the Soviets, but the main
customers of the opium were


12
0:1:10,88 --> 0:1:13,22
the Russians themselves.

It's no wonder the drug trade

It's said that Afghan terror
groups help expediate the

order to both profit from

around Novokuznetsk
