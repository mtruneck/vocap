###0 MIKKEL RASMUSSEN: Hi, my name is Mikkel Rasmussen
###2 and this is my partner, Christian Madsbjerg.
###6 And tomorrow we are launching a book
###8 called "The Moment of Clarity."
###10 It's a pretty exciting book.
###11 It's about people.
###12 It's about how to understand people,
###14 how to understand who we are as people,
###17 really understand your customers-- not so much
###19 what they think they want, but what they really want.
###23 But the book is also about how you can sometimes
###25 get people dramatically wrong, really misunderstand
###29 who we are.
###30 And it happens all the time.
###32 And I would like to start with a little story about kitchens.
###35 And most of us cook.
###38 A couple of years ago I went to a conference
###41 called Kitchens of the Future.
###43 It was a super exciting conference
###44 where people are showing lots of new technologies coming
###47 into the kitchen.
###48 And there was one presenter from Ikea
###50 together with a couple of Japanese technology companies.
###54 And they presented this vision of a future kitchen,
###57 I think it's supposed to be in 2040.
###59 And if you imagine you go into this kitchen in 2040
###63 it's what's called a smart kitchen.
###64 So it recognizes you, it has face recognition, voice
###67 recognition, there's laser beams guiding you
###70 to how to cut the fish.
###71 There's a fridge with herbs in that's
###75 grown to your health profile that's in the cloud.
###78 And if you look up in one of the corners,
###80 there's a little thing called a nanobot, which is basically
###83 a machine where you go and you say, I would like a tiramisu,
###86 for example.
###86 And it basically, out of nanomaterials,
###88 makes that cake for you.
###91 And I was completely energized by this vision.
###94 I said, this is so great.
###96 There are still people having big ideas.
###99 Until somebody noticed that in 1956
###104 there was a couple of people from General Motors,
###106 actually, doing the same exercise.
###108 But they were thinking, how will the future kitchen look?
###112 But seen from the perspective of 1956.
###115 That means, how will the kitchen look in 2006?
###118 So now we can evaluate, really.
###120 So I want to pay a little film that they
###122 made about the kitchen of the future in 1956.
###126 Can you play the movie?
###126 
###137 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###152 -But this was a kitchen like none I'd seen.
###154 Put a card in the slot and onto the screen
###157 pops a picture of just how your dish will
###159 look plus all the ingredients you need to cook.
###162 
###167 No need for the bride to feel tragic.
###170 The rest is push-button magic.
###173 So whether you bake or broil or stew,
###175 the Fridgidaire kitchen does it all for you.
###178 Don't have to be chained to the stove all day.
###181 Just set the timer and you're on your way.
###184 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###188 Tick tock, tick tock, I'm free to have fun around the clock.
###193 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###212 Jeepers, I'm exhausted.
###215 [RINGING]
###218 The kitchen of tomorrow is calling me.
###223 My cake is ready.
###225 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###235 -Time for the show.
###236 Everybody on stage.
###239 MIKKEL RASMUSSEN: I think what's really interesting
###241 to think about is if you look at the core idea of the kitchen
###246 of tomorrow as Ikea thought about it
###249 and this idea it's exactly the same idea.
###253 And the idea is cooking is slavery.
###257 Technology can free us from making food.
###260 It can do it for us.
###261 It can recognize who we are.
###263 And simply, we don't have to be tied to the kitchen all day,
###266 as they sing in this movie.
###269 And it's the same vision you see again in 2006.
###273 When we imagine the kitchen of the future
###275 it's still a kitchen that's automated.
###277 We don't have to think about it.
###279 And it has a lot of technology that
###281 actually takes the human condition out
###283 of the whole thing of cooking.
###285 Now if you're an anthropologist--
###287 we work a lot with anthropologists--
###289 they would tell you that cooking is perhaps
###292 one of the most complicated things you can think about when
###295 it comes to the human condition or human behavior.
###298 That if you think about your own cooking habits,
###300 that they probably come from your childhood, the nation
###304 you're from, the region you're from.
###305 It takes a lot of skill to cook.
###307 It's not so easy.
###308 And actually, it's quite fun to cook.
###310 There's also a lot of improvisation.
###311 I don't know if you ever tried to come home to a fridge
###314 and you just look into the fridge-- oh there's
###316 a carrot and some milk and some white wine
###318 and you figure it out.
###319 That is what cooking is like.
###320 It's a very human thing to do.
###323 And therefore, if you think about it, having anything
###326 that automates this for you or decides for you or improvises
###329 for you is actually not doing anything
###333 to help you with what you want to do, which it's nice to cook.
###337 And therefor if you make technology,
###340 for example, that has that core idea about who
###343 we are as people that cooking is slavery and the idea is wrong,
###347 then your technology will fail.
###349 Not because of the technology, but because it simply
###353 gets people wrong.
###355 And this happens all the time.
###357 And you cannot swing a cat these days without hitting one
###361 of those refrigerator companies that make smart fridges.
###364 I don't know you've ever seen them,
###365 like the intelligent fridge.
###366 There's so many of them that there is actually
###369 a website it's called fuck your internet fridge-- I'm
###372 sorry-- and is a guy who every month he tracks failed
###376 prototypes on intelligent fridges.
###380 And here you have April, 2011, May,
###382 2000-- you can actually go in today and see
###384 are there any failed internet fridges today?
###386 My guess is, there probably is.
###388 Why?
###389 Because basically, the idea is wrong-- not the technology
###393 but the idea about who we are, that we do not
###396 want the kitchen to be automated for us.
###399 We want to cook.
###400 We want Japanese knives.
###401 We want complicated cooking.
###403 And so what we are saying here is not
###405 that technology is wrong as such.
###407 It's just you need to base it, especially
###409 when you innovate really big ideas,
###411 on something that's a true human insight.
###414 And cooking as slavery is not a true human insight
###418 and therefore the prototypes will fail.
###422 There are many interesting ways to think
###425 about technology and cooking.
###426 For example, molecular cooking like this,
###429 where people experiment and broaden what cooking
###431 is, and make it more complicated,
###433 expands what we can do with cooking,
###435 as opposed to automating.
###436 So we're not saying there's something wrong with technology
###439 but we're saying, sometimes it's a good thing
###441 to understand what your core idea about the human behavior
###444 that you want to attack.
###446 Now, this is not relevant all the time.
###448 This is only relevant sometimes in a company.
###451 We have been working with really big companies
###453 for over the last 20 years.
###455 And sometimes there's a situation
###458 where things become really uncertain.
###461 We talk about it in the book as navigating in a fog.
###463 Here's an example-- this is one of the biggest sports
###466 companies in the world.
###467 And I was attending a workshop where
###469 we talked about the future.
###471 And they were presenting sport shoes and tennis catchers
###473 and all kinds of technology.
###475 And all of a sudden, in the midst of this big discussion
###477 about design, product innovation, consumers, markets,
###483 there was a creative director who
###485 raised a question that made the room go completely quiet.
###488 And the question was, is yoga a sport?
###493 And it's a really weird question to ask yourself.
###496 But think about this company.
###497 This is a company-- one of the biggest
###499 sports producers in the world.
###501 And if you work there, you are surrounded by sport.
###504 People are doing sports all the time.
###506 They wear sport shoes, they play sports, they talk about sports.
###509 Even their language has sports metaphors built into it.
###513 And the core idea behind that type of thinking
###516 is that sport is really about winning.
###520 It's about athleticism.
###522 It's about winning in the marathons and so on.
###525 And that's an idea that this company has also when
###529 they discuss in a workshop like this.
###530 I could clearly see it.
###532 So they would take up a shoe and say,
###533 so what should the consumer get out of the shoe?
###536 And they would talk about that this shoe will
###538 make the consumer run a marathon two minutes faster.
###542 And that's super great.
###543 I remember there was even a swimming technology
###547 with some stripes on that supposedly
###549 would make you do a crawl a little bit faster.
###552 Things like that-- and it's great ideas
###553 if you want to win gold medals.
###555 But what this guy was discovering,
###557 slowly it was dawning on him and the [INAUDIBLE]
###560 is there's something big we are not getting right.
###564 There's something-- I can't put my words to it,
###567 but the best way he could say it was to provoke these gentlemen
###570 and say, is yoga a sport.
###572 And what he was talking about was not yoga.
###575 It was the whole phenomenon around sport
###579 that he was questioning.
###580 He was seeing that there are now more fitness centers than post
###583 offices in every town in the world.
###585 He was seeing people doing 24 hour bike races.
###589 He was seeing the marathon times coming down,
###591 with one hour on average, because everyone now
###594 does a marathon.
###595 And he was basically seeing that sports was being democratized.
###599 And it's not only about winning gold medals.
###602 It's also about slimming yourself,
###604 feeling good about yourself, and things like that.
###606 But he had no way to say that to the company
###609 because he didn't really know how to voice it.
###611 And it was such a big problem for him
###613 that he really didn't know how to do it.
###614 And then in this situation-- that's
###618 the situation where we would say,
###619 this is the most important point where
###621 you need to get people right.
###623 If you get people right on this question,
###625 you get people-- wrong, sorry, about this question,
###627 you get them wrong all the way through.
###629 So if you think about your own business-- now we are in Google
###632 but you could think about any other business--
###634 and you have problems that you deal with in your everyday,
###636 we would say there are three types of problems.
###639 Some of them require that you get people right--
###641 you're really strong in that-- and some of them
###643 require that you can just use your intuition,
###645 especially if you're really familiar with the problem.
###648 So if you look at the three types of problems,
###650 we can start in the bottom and say, there
###652 are problems where it's not really so uncertain.
###654 We've tried it before.
###655 We are pretty predictable.
###657 And those are called knowns.
###658 You can basically put an algorithm to those problems--
###661 things like, if we put money from this channel
###663 to that channel we'll sell this much more.
###666 And that's something you can just
###667 use an MBA kind of thinking to do.
###671 They're good tools and good methods
###673 and you don't have to get people so right, really.
###675 You can base your decisions on assumptions about people.
###679 Then it becomes a little more difficult, more unpredictable,
###683 and you go to what we call hypotheticals.
###686 And those are you know what the problem is
###688 but there are various ways that you could solve the problem.
###691 For example, we are putting more money into R&D
###696 but we're not selling more.
###698 Why is that?
###699 And there could be various reasons for that.
###703 Also here there are some good tools and methods
###705 that you can use from a business school, for example,
###708 calculating your way through it, figuring out
###710 how big are things and so on.
###713 And then we get to the yoga question.
###715 Is yoga a sport?
###716 That's not a known and it's not a hypothetical.
###718 It's what we call a big unknown, that it's
###721 something big you're uncertain about.
###723 And this is the point when you don't even
###725 know what the answer is and you've never solved it before.
###729 And in the case of the sports company,
###731 this was the situation.
###732 That to deal with this problem they just
###734 couldn't calculate their way through the problem.
###736 They had to figure out well, how is sports changing as such?
###742 When you're in this situation there's something
###744 happen that we have seen in a lot of businesses, which
###747 is that we have assumptions about people
###749 that we're nearly born with or we learn somehow
###752 and they're really difficult to take off.
###755 And one of the biggest assumptions about people
###758 is this-- sorry, I'll just go on--
###762 that we can be understood as the smallest substances,
###767 like atoms.
###768 So here's a physician that once said,
###770 "Everything is made of atoms, there's nothing living that you
###775 cannot understand from the point of view that they are made
###777 of atoms according to the laws of physics."
###780 And I just have to say, really?
###783 Are we sure about that?
###785 If you take your own company I could provoke you a little bit
###788 and say, could you take this quote and put bits in?
###791 Everything is made of bits.
###793 There's nothing living that you cannot understand from
###796 the point of view of a bit or a calculation.
###799 And there's nothing wrong with thinking this way if you're
###802 familiar with what you're doing.
###805 It's by far the most efficient way to think about people,
###809 that we are basically atoms and you
###810 can reduce people to the smallest substance
###813 and then understand the totality from that.
###815 But when you're in a big unknown this is toxic.
###818 Because what will happen is that you get people completely wrong
###822 and then your ideas will end up as smart fridges
###826 that nobody wants, nobody buys, and nobody uses.
###828 
###831 Now we have seen that there is many assumptions about people.
###836 There are five I just want to talk about
###838 and then I'm going to hand it over
###839 to Christian who will give you a little bit
###841 of a philosophical background before this.
###843 And then we will give you an idea
###845 of how to get out of this mess.
###847 But there are five assumptions.
###848 So think about when you talk about users, consumers,
###851 customers, what are you talking about?
###853 Very often there's an idea that human beings
###858 are first and foremost thinking beings.
###860 That means you can understand people by scanning their brain.
###863 That's one very, very common assumption about people,
###865 that everything there is to know about you is in your brain.
###869 Another assumption is you know what you want.
###872 You know your intentions.
###873 That means you can go and ask a consumer,
###875 so would you like this in red or green?
###878 And they would actually know.
###881 A third assumption is that consumers--
###884 they're all about options and choices.
###886 So what you study is, how do you make choices?
###889 So when you go out down to the supermarket
###891 and you want to buy a juice, do you
###892 want the juice with the things in
###894 or the juice without the little things in.
###896 And that's the very, very important thing
###897 about consumers.
###899 The fourth thing that's toxic is the assumption
###903 that your consumers, your customers, your users
###907 actually know what they want.
###909 So you actually become a slave to their needs.
###912 You just ask them, what do you want?
###914 Oh, I want a red car.
###915 Hey, let's produce a red car-- that kind of thinking.
###918 And the fifth one is that people--
###921 because you can understand them from their brain
###924 and have access to their inner minds--
###926 that they are the same, regardless which
###928 social situation or mood they're in.
###931 These five assumptions-- you may think
###933 that this is pretty banal or stupid
###935 or something like that-- but these assumptions
###938 are at the core of many, many business decisions
###942 every single day that we make.
###944 When we ask people in a focus group to evaluate a product,
###949 for example, it's based on these assumptions.
###951 When we go and scan people's brains
###953 to figure out whether they like the red logo or the green logo,
###956 it's based on these assumptions.
###958 When we ask people, can you just evaluate
###960 what you want on a survey?
###962 It's based on these assumptions.
###963 And I would even have to say, sometimes
###965 when we do these big data analyses,
###967 it's based on these assumptions, that you
###970 can take people and pull them down to what they need
###973 to put it together to a bigger question
###974 and then here you have the understanding of people.
###977 
###979 Now this plays out in many interesting places.
###982 And here's an example of what can happen.
###984 So in many companies what they do is
###987 they do these big surveys about what people need and then they
###990 try to data analyze their way through this.
###993 And they end up with what's called segments.
###996 And here's an example.
###997 This is actually a spirits producer.
###999 They get us drunk.
###1000 That's what they do.
###1002 And they looked at the Asian market and women.
###1004 And they did a huge data analysis
###1006 to figure out how many women there are, how old are they,
###1008 what do they need.
###1009 They did surveys, focus groups, everything,
###1011 and boiled it down to four types of people.
###1013 I'm not going to go through all of them.
###1015 But one of them was called the modern life seeker.
###1017 And they figured out those were the people who
###1019 had the most money, who loved to drink the most,
###1022 and who we wanted to go for.
###1026 And we were asked to go out in the supermarket
###1028 and help them identify these people to study them further,
###1032 get deep inside into who they were.
###1033 But we didn't understand-- my mom,
###1036 she's not a modern life seeker.
###1038 I know that.
###1038 And my sister is not.
###1039 And my daughter is not.
###1040 I just couldn't figure out, what is a modern life seeker?
###1044 And we went out to the supermarket in Bangkok.
###1046 And in this supermarket-- it's the biggest
###1048 in the world-- it's the most instagramed, sorry, shopping
###1051 mall in the world.
###1052 There are thick women and thin women, clever, smart, dumb--
###1055 there are all types of women.
###1057 And we asked, could you point out the modern life seeker?
###1060 And they kind of started sweating and said,
###1062 she's not here.
###1065 And you know why she's not here?
###1067 Because she does not exist.
###1069 Why does she not exist?
###1071 Because it's based on wrong assumptions on who we are.
###1075 And it becomes a tool where you as a company can say,
###1078 oh our consumers are out here in a nice model
###1081 and we don't really have to be part of that.
###1083 We can just analyze them and tell them what they want.
###1086 And there are many other examples of this going on.
###1089 Maybe you should take over here.
###1090 
###1092 CHRISTIAN MADSBJERG: So what we see
###1094 is the same research project in many different ways.
###1097 So the research project is basically,
###1099 as we try to write in the book, a Cartesian-- a Rene
###1102 Descartes-inspired project.
###1104 Which is that we have access to our inner states.
###1107 We can see what we want and need.
###1110 And the mind is us.
###1112 And the mind is the brain-- so a set
###1115 of reductions about who we are.
###1118 And if we look at the world it's different.
###1121 And we'll show you a little bit about that.
###1123 But there's a couple of baseline things we see all the time.
###1126 The first one is that you can get it down to algorithms.
###1129 You can create systems for understanding the data
###1135 that people generate in their activity.
###1137 And if you take me-- where I work, what I click on,
###1141 where I'm with my phone, where I drive, and so on-- that's me.
###1144 That's a very good picture of who
###1146 I am and the kinds of decisions I make.
###1148 The second one is atomized, that you
###1150 can think of people as self-contained entities,
###1153 that we are basically individual subjects that
###1158 stand against objects and give meaning
###1160 to the world in that way.
###1162 And the last thing is that we're rational.
###1164 Everybody knows that we're not rational all the time.
###1168 But it's something-- and there's been economists
###1171 that go a little further and say that irrational might
###1173 be a category we could use as well.
###1175 But basically, it's the rational irrational model.
###1178 And we think that's wrong.
###1180 And I'll show you a picture here to explain what it is we mean.
###1183 This is a picture from a project by a guy called Paul Radcliff.
###1188 And he asked people to take pictures of the best moment
###1191 in a week, the time in the week that was best.
###1195 And it's this lady-- she sends a picture of umbrellas.
###1199 And I think you know this kind of day
###1200 in New York City where it's soaking wet.
###1205 And she lost her crappy umbrella.
###1207 Her umbrella was destroyed by wind.
###1209 And she tried to trash it.
###1211 And when she tried to trash it she
###1212 saw that that happened to others as well.
###1215 Which meant that the most absurdly annoying situation
###1220 of getting completely soaked and losing your umbrella
###1224 became delightful because it was funny.
###1226 It's funny that other people were in the same situation.
###1229 And I think you can also imagine what that situation is like
###1232 because you've been there.
###1234 So you're connected to humanity in a bigger
###1236 way than just rational processes.
###1239 You're connected to humanity in the way
###1240 that we understand each other.
###1243 I was at an art museum in Los Angeles
###1246 not long ago when I met this guy that
###1248 was sitting on a bench crying.
###1251 And he looked at a big Syrian tapestry from the 1600.
###1258 And I asked him, so why are you crying?
###1259 And he said, because I don't feel lonely anymore.
###1262 I feel that somebody, in a place I don't know, 400 years ago,
###1266 felt exactly the same as me.
###1268 So the picture was about paradise.
###1271 And he'd just lost his mother.
###1272 And he was thinking, where is she?
###1274 What's going to happen to her?
###1276 And somebody in a place completely distant,
###1278 400 years ago, had the exact same feelings as him.
###1281 So he felt connected to humanity and he
###1283 didn't feel atomized anymore.
###1285 He felt connected to something.
###1287 And that's a fairly deep insight, if you think about it.
###1291 It is that we are, first and foremost, not thinking things.
###1296 We're social things.
###1297 We're geared into worlds, and if you strip us of our world,
###1301 we make no sense at all.
###1303 We're not interesting at all.
###1304 It is how we are in the world that is meaningful.
###1308 And we navigate our world through familiarity.
###1311 You know this, I guess, when you go
###1314 to a city you've never been to before.
###1316 Everything looks new.
###1317 Right now the street you go down looks
###1319 like the street to the baker or to the cleaner or something
###1322 like that, because you're so familiar with your own city.
###1325 But when you move to someplace-- I moved to New York City
###1329 from Denmark five years ago.
###1330 And it's only now I understand how extremely Danish I am.
###1335 When I lived in Denmark I didn't see it at all.
###1337 It wasn't at the forefront for me.
###1339 I couldn't see it.
###1340 In the same way, when you stand in line for coffee,
###1342 it's only when somebody breaks the rules
###1344 of standing in line that you understand that there are rules
###1347 for standing in line, right?
###1349 So our familiarity with the world
###1351 is how we find our way around.
###1353 And that whole layer is not in the data
###1357 normally-- the understanding of how we act upon the world
###1361 and how we make sense of it.
###1363 In the philosophical tradition they
###1364 call that understanding, as opposed to knowledge.
###1367 Knowledge is data in the way that you
###1369 have a fair bit of data.
###1371 But understanding is how you interpret that.
###1375 In the philosophical tradition there's
###1377 also been the debate about how do
###1379 you make sense of lots of data.
###1381 And Francis Bacon, 400-ish years ago,
###1384 said that the conclusions will fall out of the data itself.
###1388 If you look to the big data people,
###1391 they will often say that we don't need theory anymore.
###1394 We don't need interpretation anymore.
###1396 Because we have so much data now that it
###1398 will conclude by itself, OK?
###1400 If this is true, you can't do that.
###1403 You do it based on something.
###1405 And it's only when you don't have familiarity with something
###1408 that you need this kind of analysis that we are proposing.
###1412 We basically are in the world already.
###1417 We're always already in the world,
###1419 and we're always already making sense of it
###1421 before it even happens.
###1423 So we know that's a chair without taking our subjectivity
###1427 and looking at the object and then seeing what it is.
###1430 We just know it's a chair.
###1431 And we're very familiar with chairs.
###1433 
###1435 So what we say that there are three building blocks
###1437 you need in order to be in situations where
###1441 the business doesn't work, where you're not making sense.
###1443 So if you systematically launch products that gain 1% to 2%
###1449 market share, you might want to think about it.
###1453 So the first thing is a humanized mindset.
###1455 So, a mindset about humanity that's
###1458 different than the rational one.
###1459 The second one is what we call thick data, which
###1462 is data about our familiarity with the world.
###1465 And the third thing is what we call
###1466 non-linear problem solving.
###1468 And I'll give you a couple of examples fast.
###1470 The first one is we say, the differences.
###1472 There's a big difference between properties
###1474 about something and aspects about something.
###1477 The property of a woman is that she's a woman.
###1482 You can say it like that.
###1483 It's biological.
###1484 It's pretty clear that you can analyze that.
###1486 You can use natural science methods to see that.
###1489 The aspects about whether she's feminine or not is an aspect.
###1494 It's a human thing.
###1495 It's layered into our familiarity with the world.
###1497 And what we are proposing is that lots of people
###1500 miss the aspects by only focusing on the properties.
###1503 And that's what you get when you use natural science
###1506 methods understanding humanity.
###1510 Thick data is trying to analyze what does something mean?
###1515 How are things layered into our behavior?
###1517 So for instance, if you go to a bar,
###1519 and you see an attractive person winking to you at the bar,
###1525 you would know within a second, without even thinking about it,
###1528 whether it's suggestive, ironic, critical-- whatever kind of all
###1534 the options a small movement with the eye can be.
###1538 Understanding that and the understanding of how you easy
###1541 gauge whether that wink is suggestive or not-- means,
###1544 let's leave together or not-- is important for your success
###1548 at that situation.
###1550 And it's something you all know but it's
###1552 hard to analyze unless you get thick data.
###1555 And the way we do that is we import it
###1556 from the human sciences.
###1558 So that is sociology, anthropology, and so on,
###1561 that have methods in order to do this.
###1563 And it analyzes what's below the threshold of awareness.
###1567 Now Mikkel told you before about sports.
###1570 At the time, when we're talking about this company that
###1573 is in the sports industry, they called
###1575 fitness "sports preparation."
###1578 If think about that for a moment the reason why
###1580 it's called sports preparation is, of course,
###1583 that you prepare yourself to win gold medals.
###1585 The only reason for going to the gym
###1587 or doing yoga or anything like that could only
###1589 be-- if you are in the mindset that sports is about winning--
###1592 is to prepare yourself for something real,
###1594 instead of just going to the gym.
###1597 And what we found when we looked at these things
###1599 was we found what in this case we
###1602 call it the little black dress phenomenon.
###1603 But it was basically a fitness measurement tool for women
###1608 that we found across generations, across geography,
###1614 which was a dress that was a little bit too small.
###1619 So it was an ambition, and it was
###1620 layered into-- the whole reason they
###1623 did what they did was embodied in that dress.
###1626 And that's the kind of data that we call thick data.
###1628 
###1631 It's not the kind of data I guess you work with the most,
###1633 and we're not saying that that's in any way wrong,
###1636 we're just saying this is another type of data that
###1638 can be very helpful if you don't have familiarity with an area.
###1641 
###1644 So what we call default thinking,
###1647 hypothesis-based inquiry, answers what and how much,
###1654 research on what is and has been or is happening right now--
###1659 and what we're saying is that there's another type.
###1661 And we call it sense making in the book.
###1663 It's an exploratory inquiry.
###1665 You're not basing yourself on-- you're not
###1668 trying to test a hypothesis.
###1670 You are trying to cast a net and understand
###1673 patterns of behavior.
###1676 And in the bottom you can see the difference
###1678 between correctness and truth.
###1680 This is a classic Martin Heidegger distinction.
###1682 It's that there's lots of things that are correct
###1685 but that isn't true.
###1686 So for instance, if I ask my daughter,
###1690 could you please put six plates on the table,
###1694 she would go and put six plates on the table.
###1696 And I'll come in and they're all in a stack.
###1698 And I'll say, well that's not what I meant.
###1700 I meant around the table with forks and knives and stuff.
###1704 And she will say, well six.
###1706 So it's completely correct.
###1707 There are six plates on the table.
###1710 But that's not the truth about how
###1711 you eat together in a sense.
###1714 And what we're trying to get to say
###1715 is that there is a method for getting
###1717 to that shared, common humanity truth about us.
###1724 You want to say something?
###1725 MIKKEL RASMUSSEN: Yes.
###1727 And I just want to show you how one company works with this.
###1731 It's a company that many of you know well.
###1733 It's Lego.
###1734 And many years ago they were in trouble
###1737 because they were losing money.
###1739 But also they were expanding into territories
###1742 that they didn't know so well.
###1744 And somehow they got people wrong.
###1748 At that time, when we met Lego, they
###1751 had some pretty strong assumptions
###1754 about what's going to happen to play.
###1756 And one of them is, we're to die because PlayStation
###1759 is going to take it all.
###1760 Another one was a phenomenon called instant traction.
###1763 Have you heard about this?
###1765 The idea is that kids these days-- they have no attention,
###1769 you can't get them to do anything.
###1771 So when you go into a toy store, the toy
###1773 needs to be very noisy and very easy to play with,
###1776 because that's the only way you can get their attention.
###1779 They also had a creativity idea which
###1782 was called crisp, cool, wow.
###1784 And that was, anything was evaluated on
###1786 is it crisp, is it cool, or is what--
###1787 nobody knew what it meant.
###1790 Is it crisp, cool, or wow.
###1791 So that means you can just do anything.
###1794 That boys wanted evil-- so you can see when they did Bionicle
###1798 that there's dark and red and blood and death.
###1802 And that girls wanted pink-- and you
###1804 can see that it's pink princess, everything was pink, and so on.
###1808 And basically they assumed that because of this the brick
###1812 has no future.
###1813 We have to head in another direction.
###1816 And they did that by launching a lot of new innovations
###1820 that was beyond the brick-- software
###1823 and toothbrushes and violent toys and all kinds of things.
###1826 And it basically got them into trouble.
###1830 They got a new CEO who at one point
###1833 said, I think we need to understand,
###1835 before we take any decisions, why do kids plays
###1839 and what role do we play in that?
###1843 And the first step in getting the human condition right,
###1847 like Christian was talking about,
###1849 is not really doing any research or meeting
###1851 any consumers or anything like that.
###1852 It's looking at the assumptions you have
###1854 and trying to change the question.
###1856 We talk about this as framing your problem as a phenomena.
###1860 And that's a very academic way of saying it.
###1862 A simpler way is, try to ask your business question in a way
###1866 that a person can experience.
###1869 So for example, the big business question for Lego at that point
###1873 was, how can we sell more toys?
###1875 It's a very natural, very good question.
###1877 It's just that it's not something anybody experiences.
###1880 And what they did is change that around to a question which was,
###1886 why do kids play?
###1887 It's a very simple little trick but it does wonder.
###1890 Because you start looking at very different behaviors
###1895 when you look at why do kids play.
###1897 It's actually a little tricky, if you look at a kid,
###1899 why do they play?
###1900 Jesus, I don't know why they play.
###1902 They just do it.
###1903 Yeah, but why do they play?
###1905 And what Lego did was they spent half a year going out to kids,
###1911 living with kids, observing kids, figuring out
###1914 what's their world like, figuring out parents, figuring
###1917 out how school works, and trying to go down
###1920 to that thick data that could reveal why do kids play
###1924 and then try to make sense of that to find their own future.
###1929 Now this was a really interesting experience
###1933 and lots of interesting stories.
###1934 Here's one of them.
###1937 This is a shoe worn by a boy in Germany, I believe.
###1941 And the shoe is 1,000 times more worth for him than a new shoe.
###1947 And we asked him why.
###1949 And he says, because it's worn in the right places it
###1953 shows that I can do a kick flipper.
###1955 This shoes is worn in the right places
###1958 because he has tried a million times
###1960 to do the trick on the skateboard that makes him stand
###1963 out in the hierarchy among his friends.
###1967 And if you look at that, it really
###1969 means that he does not suffer from attention span
###1972 or loss of mastery or de-skilling or anything
###1975 like that.
###1976 This kid is deeply into one thing
###1979 and he does it everyday for hours and hours and hours
###1982 and hours.
###1984 And what Lego found was all the kids
###1988 that they met had this deep mastery of something.
###1991 They met one little guy who knew everything about sharks.
###1996 So he was building a shark in Lego
###1998 and they asked him so what shark is the one with 23 teeth?
###2001 Because there's one shark that has that.
###2003 And he knew the whole history of sharks.
###2006 
###2010 Now they also found another interesting thing,
###2012 which was that a lot of kids, when you play with them--
###2017 not talk to them-- they reveal a big world of inside knowledge
###2022 that we don't know as adults.
###2024 We call it under the radar.
###2026 We don't know it's there.
###2027 So here's an example.
###2028 It's a German boy who Lego met.
###2032 And his mum told them that this boy was really bad at maths.
###2039 He was not good at school, probably had ADHD, and so on.
###2043 And she was kind of worried about him.
###2046 And to show that, she had given him a trumpet.
###2050 Do you think he was playing on the trumpet?
###2051 Not really.
###2052 But what he was doing was he was doing
###2054 something called fantasy football.
###2056 And we observed that.
###2057 And he was sitting with a big piece of paper.
###2060 And then he was in like soccer-- so he's going
###2064 and Luftkicker was going-- and he was coming up
###2066 with these imaginary football teams, imaginary players.
###2069 And then he would make a statistic,
###2071 after 90 minutes of playing the game, about who won.
###2075 But not only that, he would also make probabilities of,
###2079 if you put your money on Luftkicker against Litana,
###2083 it's probably a nine to one.
###2085 So here's a kid where his mom and probably his school
###2088 and all the psychologists in the world would say,
###2091 he suffers from attention span.
###2093 He's not good at math.
###2094 We're worried about him.
###2096 But what LEGO discovered was that behind all that,
###2100 there was a kid who had so much talent and so much mastery.
###2104 It's just nobody was seeing it.
###2106 
###2109 They took this insight and really thought about,
###2114 what does it mean for us.
###2116 And basically they saw three big things.
###2119 One was kids have mastery and they strive for mastery.
###2124 Anything that's difficult and complex and deep
###2126 is great for kids.
###2127 The other thing-- this was the thing
###2129 with the shoe and the skateboard--
###2131 is that a lot of kids these days are looking for hierarchy.
###2136 I'm meaning, if you ask any kid, so who's
###2138 best at maths in your class?
###2140 She will say, oh that's Jim.
###2142 And who's number 17?
###2144 That's Jack.
###2145 Ask any European kid, so which Italian player
###2149 scored the most goals three years ago?
###2151 They'd know.
###2152 And so we found hierarchies everywhere, everywhere.
###2156 So mastery and hierarchy.
###2159 And the last thing was the sensation
###2163 of building something big and complex and challenging.
###2169 If you looked at those three things
###2171 and just think about-- we're moving into girls' toys,
###2175 we're moving into toothbrushes, violent toys, stories
###2178 with a lot of storytelling, and we're move ourselves away
###2182 from the core experience of building something,
###2184 creating something.
###2186 And you look at the three things that kids really
###2188 need, which is-- mastery, hierarchy, and challenges.
###2194 LEGO found, but maybe the answer is just right here
###2197 in front of us and it's called a brick.
###2200 Because a brick can give you mastery.
###2203 A brick can give you hierarchy if you've built something
###2205 and show other people.
###2207 And a brick can give you a challenge.
###2209 And if there was a way we could put that idea into all
###2213 of the things we're doing, all the innovations
###2215 we're coming up with, all the products we're coming up with,
###2218 the way our shops look, the way our digital tools are going
###2221 to look-- and they took that very idea of back
###2226 to the brick and mastery, hierarchy, and challenges
###2230 and put it into their core offerings.
###2233 So they created tools where kids could design their own LEGO
###2237 and get it printed, basically.
###2239 They created LEGO games that gave you skill and hierarchy
###2242 and they went into the digital universe with a much bigger
###2246 precision than they could before.
###2248 And if you ask the CEO, he says today they're
###2252 number two toy company in the world.
###2255 They're really profitable and successful.
###2257 And not only because of that but also
###2259 because of that-- if you ask him, he would say,
###2262 well there are two reasons.
###2263 One is that we basically did the hygiene on the company
###2267 and we now have cost control and we
###2268 know where we're making money.
###2270 And all that you can learn in am MBA.
###2271 So that was one thing.
###2273 And the other thing was that now we
###2275 understand why kids play-- hierarchy,
###2279 mastery, and challenges.
###2281 And we can put that into everything we do.
###2284 OK, so that's the story about how to do that.
###2288 And in this book we say there is a generic method behind this
###2292 that any company could learn, any company can do,
###2295 if you do it right.
###2296 If you start by framing your question as a phenomenon,
###2299 then you dig into how people really
###2301 are, how they really live, and get a thick understand of that.
###2304 Then you find the patterns in that and say,
###2306 what are the interesting patterns?
###2308 Then you say, what are the consequences for our business?
###2310 And then you frame that as an idea that
###2312 can create impact for your business.
###2314 That's basically the simple way of doing it.
###2316 It's really simple to say.
###2317 It's not so easy to do.
###2319 But it is simple to say, because I just did it.
###2323 OK so really what we are saying is,
###2327 we think that in an age of a lot of big data
###2330 and a lot of rational thinking, there
###2333 is a need also for getting a little bit of humanity
###2337 into business again.
###2339 And there is a science of understanding people.
###2342 It's called human science, anthropology, social science,
###2344 political science, parts of economics,
###2347 literature, linguistics-- that has 100 to 200 years'
###2353 tradition of understanding people.
###2354 And all they're really saying is,
###2356 there is something about us that's not on the surface,
###2360 they can only be discovered if we reveal it.
###2363 And I think that one of the most emotional moments of mine when
###2366 I wrote this book was when I was listening to a song--
###2368 I write and listen to songs at the same time--
###2371 and there was a song by Tom Waits which
###2375 is called "San Diego Serenade," and he
###2378 sings about how he never saw the morning
###2383 until he stayed up all night.
###2385 And I can remember that from when
###2387 I was a teenager, the first time I went out to a party
###2389 and came home and the bird were singing, it was in the summer,
###2392 and I could just feel the sensation
###2395 of what a morning really is.
###2397 I never saw that before.
###2398 And that's what he's singing about.
###2399 He sings about, I never saw the sunshine
###2401 until you turned out the light.
###2403 He says, I never saw my home town
###2406 until I stayed away too long.
###2408 And then he's saying, I never heard a melody
###2411 until I needed a song.
###2413 And that's the very simple message
###2415 that we have for you guys, that there is a way
###2417 to get both the top layers of our experience as humans
###2421 but also get to the deeper layers.
###2423 And both are needed in the future.
###2426 Thanks a lot.
###2427 
###2436 CHRISTIAN MADSBJERG: What do you do now?
###2439 Any questions?
###2439 
###2442 AUDIENCE: I have a question.
###2443 Hi, thanks for joining us.
###2445 Can you talk a little bit about how
###2447 you identify the right question to ask?
###2451 So sort of the process of getting to the why
###2454 do kids play-- what's that like?
###2456 CHRISTIAN MADSBJERG: See, this is a really good question.
###2459 And it's interesting because we got that question a few times
###2462 before.
###2463 And the literature doesn't reveal anything.
###2467 So our main inspirations, which are German philosophers
###2470 basically-- so Martin Heidegger-- later
###2472 on French philosophers, have no method to this.
###2477 The way we do that is we turn it into a verb.
###2479 So we say, what's the main, most banal,
###2482 we call average, everyday experience that people
###2486 have here.
###2487 And then say, what might that be like?
###2492 So we say, what's the average, everyday practice that people
###2496 have, and are there interesting and juicy questions
###2500 that once you think about it-- once you think about play,
###2503 I mean, I know kids play.
###2505 But I don't really know why.
###2506 And if we don't know why, how can we ever,
###2509 ever produce toys that are helpful in that case?
###2514 Why do people work out?
###2517 So it's so dumb and average, everyday and intuitive
###2522 that people, in the beginning, feel, well what does mean?
###2526 And the way that the traditional talks about this
###2528 is as a phenomenon.
###2530 That's also why the philosophy behind this
###2532 is called phenomenology.
###2534 So it's-- what's the human phenomenon that we can all
###2537 share and all experience and that's so close to us that we
###2541 never see it.
###2542 It's like wearing glasses-- maybe not Google Glasses,
###2544 but any old glasses-- that you don't think much about.
###2552 So like I said before, when you go out
###2555 to what is called a mini kitchen-- which
###2558 is a fairly large kitchen-- but if you go out there
###2561 and there are many people around the coffee machine,
###2564 there would be a line.
###2565 There's somebody that's next to get coffee.
###2568 But you only see that once somebody breaks it.
###2572 So other than that, it just works as our everyday dealings
###2577 in the world.
###2578 And that's exactly what we're interested in.
###2580 So we're interested in the things that are so everyday
###2583 that we don't see them.
###2586 And there's a German filmmaker called
###2592 Wim Wenders that made a movie called, "Far away So Close."
###2597 And that's the whole point.
###2598 It's so close to us that it's far away.
###2602 And it's because we can't think about those things
###2604 all the time.
###2605 You can't think about how do I stand in line?
###2607 You just do it.
###2608 Or how do you drive a car-- if you move to New York City--
###2611 I moved to New York City and I'm still
###2612 trying to figure out how traffic works here.
###2615 People speed up at the wrong times and break at--
###2617 and they get annoyed with me.
###2619 I don't know why they get annoyed with me.
###2622 A space between two cars is an opportunity
###2624 to get ahead and get to the red light as fast as possible.
###2628 AUDIENCE: Just don't drive.
###2629 CHRISTIAN MADSBJERG: Exactly.
###2630 Exactly.
###2631 So places have styles.
###2633 And I guess, in a couple of years,
###2634 I might figure out how it works .
###2636 And I'll start get annoyed with people
###2638 when they break those laws.
###2639 But I don't think any of the people
###2641 in the system would ever think about,
###2643 what's the style of driving in New York City.
###2645 It's just what happens, right?
###2647 And that's exactly the object of study.
###2650 So we study familiarity, how we are familiar with things.
###2654 And familiarity withdrawals.
###2656 In the sense, the classic example is a hammer.
###2659 Hammering-- the last thing you want
###2661 to do when you hammer is think about it.
###2664 You want to be-- you will hit your hand and so on.
###2668 And that is when hammers are most hammers,
###2671 is when they are engaged with skillful people using it.
###2674 That's when hammers reveal themselves.
###2676 You can also look at the properties and say,
###2678 it has a wooden shank and a metal blob at the end
###2681 and so on.
###2681 You can decode it from a natural science perspective,
###2684 how much it weighs and so on.
###2685 But it doesn't weight anything, except if it's too heavy.
###2689 It's just perfect when you use it.
###2692 In that sense, the hammer withdraws from our experience.
###2696 And hammering becomes the experience, in a sense, right?
###2700 Does that answer the question?
###2702 OK, good.
###2703 So again, familiarity.
###2704 AUDIENCE: All right, so a question from here.
###2707 So when I was listening to your talk,
###2710 first with the example of the kitchen and later
###2713 with the LEGO example, I noticed that the examples
###2715 were all very male centric.
###2718 They were about soccer.
###2720 All the kids in question were all boys.
###2724 So which made me think, when you're doing this process
###2728 and you're asking about the why, how
###2729 do you guard against your implicit biases
###2735 finding only part of the answer.
###2739 CHRISTIAN MADSBJERG: So that's a methodological question
###2742 that you can't get out of.
###2744 And it's called the hermeneutic circle.
###2746 It's basically, in order to understand something,
###2749 you need to use yourself and your own experience.
###2753 A Shakespeare comedy isn't funny unless you
###2756 use your own experience.
###2758 Because-- yeah well, that's obvious.
###2761 So the way that we try to do this
###2764 is to work with our biases, be aware of them
###2768 and try to adjust for them as much as you can,
###2771 but accepting that you can never-- there is
###2774 no view from nowhere when you study people.
###2776 When you study quarks and atoms and bits and bytes
###2779 or something like that, there is a view from nowhere.
###2781 And the natural sciences is a pretty good example
###2783 and a very successful example of that.
###2784 But for human sciences, your insight,
###2787 the interpretation yourself, so you have to work with it
###2790 and be honest, basically, about your own biases and so on.
###2794 Now we just did a study about women and drinking,
###2797 which are two very exciting topics.
###2801 And we found that women are starting going out,
###2805 in places like Russia, China, Brazil,
###2807 where they never, ever went out with their friends and so on.
###2811 And it turns out it freaks out the men.
###2813 They sit at home and don't know really what to do.
###2816 And a whole new culture is starting,
###2820 especially in Asia it's quite prevalent
###2822 and it's a whole new market and so on.
###2825 So it's not just men we study.
###2828 I guess the examples were biased in that direction.
###2831 But in that case, you need to, again, work
###2833 with your own assumptions and your own biases
###2835 as much as you can.
###2837 And there is no view from nowhere.
###2840 [INAUDIBLE]
###2841 MIKKEL RASMUSSEN: When Christian talked
###2842 he talked about three things you need and one of the last one
###2845 was called non-linear problem solving.
###2848 And it basically means exactly what you are talking about now,
###2851 which is you cannot take your own ideas out of the picture.
###2855 That means this type of analysis will never
###2858 be a completely 100% percent exact analysis of how it always
###2862 will be.
###2863 It will be a hunch about how something works.
###2867 Like when you go in and see a movie,
###2869 and you talk about it afterwards,
###2871 you have an interpretation of that movie.
###2873 But we are saying is if a company can
###2876 have a conversation about the customers they are serving
###2880 and start making interpretations based on deep data,
###2883 it's much, much better than having a numbers-based
###2886 and very thin data because it gives them an insight.
###2890 But you have to place a bet.
###2892 It's not like a one-to-one where you can say,
###2894 oh they all have red shoes.
###2895 Let's make red shoes.
###2896 It's not like that.
###2897 I hope that makes sense.
###2898 CHRISTIAN MADSBJERG: Yeah, and you can say that there's-- you
###2902 can go to school.
###2904 And anthropology is a tradition that's
###2907 100 years old which is about understanding culture.
###2911 And just like you wouldn't ask somebody that's not an engineer
###2915 to build a bridge, it can be helpful to have
###2917 that kind of training if you want to do cultural analysis.
###2922 But that doesn't give them-- anthropologists-- a view
###2925 from nowhere, either, in the sense of natural sciences.
###2930 Oh, sorry.
###2931 AUDIENCE: Sorry.
###2932 When you guys are working with leaders
###2933 who are so focused on the bottom line, what's the persuasion
###2935 conversation like to say, you're focused on this question,
###2938 but the actual one is like, why play,
###2940 instead of how to make more money?
###2942 CHRISTIAN MADSBJERG: So, first of all, it works.
###2945 That tends to help.
###2948 But it feels intellectual to them.
###2951 It feels non-familiar.
###2954 It doesn't feel familiar to start
###2955 talking about lived experience in this kind of complex way.
###2959 But if they're in enough trouble, they tend to listen.
###2964 So a healthy crisis is always a good sign.
###2967 And you can say that the LEGO company had, at that point
###2971 that we're talking about here, lost around $300,000 a day
###2974 for 10 years.
###2976 That makes people start listening a little bit.
###2979 And it's a private company so it's-- they were in trouble,
###2984 so that tends to help.
###2986 MIKKEL RASMUSSEN: I also think we've
###2986 experienced, when we talk especially to people pretty
###2989 high up, that there's a kind of fatigue with the tools
###2991 they have available.
###2992 There's a fatigue with the way strategy is done,
###2995 the over-quantification of everything,
###2997 the million PowerPoint show, how all the strategies end up
###3001 with the same idea that we need to fight our core,
###3004 we need to go into new areas, and we
###3006 need to build capabilities.
###3007 It's always those three things.
###3008 It doesn't matter whether it's soap or [? tennis cases ?].
###3011 It's the same strategy.
###3012 And we can sense that there's time
###3015 where those discussions-- and I think many leaders are looking
###3021 for something new, something that is deeper and more
###3023 inspirational, basically, I think.
###3025 CHRISTIAN MADSBJERG: And I would say,
###3026 I'm surprised by how complex thinkers some of these leaders
###3030 are, actually.
###3031 Which is a nice thing.
###3033 That if you are at that level, there's
###3036 a reason why you're at that level.
###3037 And you have bandwidth enough to deal with many things
###3042 at the same time.
###3044 So that's very positive, in a sense.
###3045 Thank you.
###3047 MIKKEL RASMUSSEN: You have a question.
###3047 AUDIENCE: Yeah, so my question is around thick data.
###3049 And I think guys describe qualitatively what
###3055 it was, I guess, in your own style.
###3058 But before you had this dichotomy of it's
###3062 not focus groups, it's not explicit questions,
###3065 it's a little more tacit or a little more subtle.
###3069 And I was wondering how do you go
###3072 about collecting that thick data?
###3074 Or what's that process like?
###3075 Because it seems more subtle and a little more responsive
###3079 to the environment.
###3080 And for example, with the playing with kids example,
###3084 it wasn't just observing them or taking notes
###3088 but it was also the process of actually playing with them
###3091 and maybe putting yourself in their shoes a little bit.
###3093 So I was wondering if you have any thoughts
###3095 about that methodology on a larger scale.
###3098 CHRISTIAN MADSBJERG: So anthropology
###3100 has developed a tools set called ethnographic data gathering
###3105 from the 1920s and on.
###3108 And it's basically largely misunderstood
###3111 in business today.
###3112 Because it means in-house, in-context interviews.
###3116 So interview is one thing and what
###3118 we say and so on is important, but it's also important
###3121 what we do.
###3122 And so what we normally is say is,
###3124 we're not interested in people, really.
###3126 We're interested in worlds.
###3128 And a world has people in it, for sure.
###3131 So let's say the world of cooking,
###3133 or the world of business, or the world of Google.
###3137 They're all-- or the art world.
###3139 They all have-- it's not a thing.
###3142 The art world is not a thing.
###3143 It consists of galleries and artists and pencils
###3146 and paper and canvases and all sorts of things.
###3150 And it has roles in there, so people that feel they're
###3153 artists.
###3154 And it has identities.
###3155 And it has money.
###3156 It has all sorts of things.
###3158 In order to understand a world, you
###3161 need a hook into that world.
###3163 And the way we do that is through getting
###3165 people and seeing how they deal with things
###3168 and how they do the things that they do.
###3170 So it's not that they can-- I mean,
###3172 they always lie to themselves.
###3174 We all like to ourselves all the time about,
###3176 I need to cook for my children all the time
###3179 and then I can't find my pots and pans.
###3180 That sort of situation.
###3182 And we just try to cut through that by saying,
###3186 individuals are less interesting than worlds,
###3190 the worlds of people.
###3191 So what we study is not individuals.
###3193 It's world.
###3195 So in a sense-- Margaret Thatcher
###3197 used to say, there is no such thing as society,
###3199 only individuals.
###3199 We say the other way around.
###3200 We say there is no such thing as individuals, only societies.
###3204 You are what you do and the way you do it, but also
###3207 because of all these other people that
###3209 deeply influence you.
###3210 And you might feel that you have rational decisions on what
###3213 you do.
###3213 But you don't.
###3214 You make all sorts of decisions because of your surrounding
###3217 and because the world you're in.
###3220 Heidegger calls it the one.
###3222 One does this and one does that.
###3224 That's most of the time.
###3226 We do things because that's what one does.
###3228 One gets up in the morning.
###3229 One asks questions when it's uncomfortable
###3231 that nobody's asked questions-- that sort of situation.
###3234 And that's exactly what we study.
###3236 We study how people live in worlds
###3240 and how those worlds interact with them, in a sense.
###3243 So it's observational, but it's with a theoretical framework
###3247 behind it, in a sense.
###3249 AUDIENCE: Thanks.
###3250 CHRISTIAN MADSBJERG: Did I answer the question?
###3251 AUDIENCE: Yeah, thanks.
###3252 CHRISTIAN MADSBJERG: Great, thanks Good?
###3256 Thank you.
