1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:15,38



2
0:0:15,38 --> 0:0:17,1
MALE SPEAKER: After the march,
we headed up the road to the


3
0:0:17,1 --> 0:0:18,93
Catholic area of Ardoyne.


4
0:0:18,93 --> 0:0:21,53
But if we were looking for
calm, for sobriety and


5
0:0:21,53 --> 0:0:24,76
level-headedness, we weren't
going to find it there either.


6
0:0:24,76 --> 0:0:27,3
On July 12, the anger
is ecumenical.


7
0:0:27,3 --> 0:0:29,285
MALE SPEAKER: One in every three
people killed during the


8
0:0:29,285 --> 0:0:33,4
conflict were killed in one
square mile of North Belfast.


9
0:0:33,4 --> 0:0:35,4
So it was quite intense.


10
0:0:35,4 --> 0:0:39,17
And the emotions around it
are still quite high.


11
0:0:39,17 --> 0:0:40,64
MALE SPEAKER: While a gaggle of
journalists waited up the


12
0:0:40,64 --> 0:0:43,15
road, Jerry smuggled us
in with the marchers.


13
0:0:43,15 --> 0:0:46,29
But they were still hostile to
the presence of our cameras.


14
0:0:46,29 --> 0:0:48,46
Angry that a portion of the
Orange parade was marching


15
0:0:48,46 --> 0:0:50,74
down a road that separated
Catholic and Protestant


16
0:0:50,74 --> 0:0:53,76
communities, one that they
called their road, they


17
0:0:53,76 --> 0:0:56,44
demanded that they, too,
be allowed to march.


18
0:0:56,44 --> 0:0:58,65
The country's parades commission
wouldn't allow it,


19
0:0:58,65 --> 0:1:1,77
fearful that the two groups
would meet on the street and


20
0:1:1,77 --> 0:1:2,29
tear each other to pieces.


21
0:1:2,29 --> 0:1:4,99
MALE SPEAKER: Come out at the
top of the road, this was


22
0:1:4,99 --> 0:1:7,16
initially where it was
going to come out.


23
0:1:7,16 --> 0:1:11,33
And it's blocked by PSNI and a
bunch of what look like four


24
0:1:11,33 --> 0:1:12,72
or five armored things.


25
0:1:12,72 --> 0:1:16,69
And if you notice over there,
they are fully in riot gear,


26
0:1:16,69 --> 0:1:20,76
with helmets and shields
and all that.


27
0:1:20,76 --> 0:1:24,67
When the Orange Order comes by
at probably around 8:00, these


28
0:1:24,67 --> 0:1:25,68
two exits were totally
blocked.


29
0:1:25,68 --> 0:1:28,9
MALE SPEAKER: Yes.


30
0:1:28,9 --> 0:1:29,34
MALE SPEAKER: People
can't get out.


31
0:1:29,34 --> 0:2:29,842



32
0:2:29,842 --> 0:2:39,682
[MUSIC PLAYING]


33
0:2:39,682 --> 0:2:54,55



34
0:2:54,55 --> 0:3:5,82
[MUSIC PLAYING]


35
0:3:5,82 --> 0:3:14,83



36
0:3:14,83 --> 0:3:34,252
[MUSIC PLAYING]


37
0:3:34,252 --> 0:3:58,654
[MUSIC PLAYING]


38
0:3:58,654 --> 0:4:49,0



39
0:4:49,0 --> 0:4:51,69
MALE SPEAKER: Fucking Christ!


40
0:4:51,69 --> 0:4:53,39
MALE SPEAKER: In the midst of
the chaos, we found Martin


41
0:4:53,39 --> 0:4:56,41
Meehan, a former IRA prisoner
and a leading dissident


42
0:4:56,41 --> 0:4:58,72
Republican who opposes
the peace process.


43
0:4:58,72 --> 0:5:0,84
Meehan took the opportunity
to heap scorn on those


44
0:5:0,84 --> 0:5:3,82
Republicans who have entered
mainstream politics.


45
0:5:3,82 --> 0:5:6,12
It's hypocritical, he says,
for them to condemn the


46
0:5:6,12 --> 0:5:7,37
violence in Ardoyne.


47
0:5:7,37 --> 0:5:46,9



48
0:5:46,9 --> 0:5:50,31
MALE SPEAKER: We're on the other
side where we police


49
0:5:50,31 --> 0:5:52,1
are, where the Protestant
neighborhood is, and where the


50
0:5:52,1 --> 0:5:53,1
march came by.


51
0:5:53,1 --> 0:5:56,25
And you can see the refuse,
and the debris, and the


52
0:5:56,25 --> 0:5:59,48
incredibly heavy, almost
a rock like


53
0:5:59,48 --> 0:6:0,78
police presence here.


54
0:6:0,78 --> 0:6:2,1
And they're not going to
be going anywhere.


55
0:6:2,1 --> 0:6:5,5
Because this thing isn't
ending any time soon.


56
0:6:5,5 --> 0:6:6,67
The kids aren't getting tired.


57
0:6:6,67 --> 0:6:8,77
And there are petrol bombs.


58
0:6:8,77 --> 0:6:10,6
One just went off right there.


59
0:6:10,6 --> 0:6:12,66
And fireworks are going off.


60
0:6:12,66 --> 0:6:14,9
And the police firing
plastic bullets.


61
0:6:14,9 --> 0:6:17,69
And this is a pretty common
occurrence around


62
0:6:17,69 --> 0:6:18,79
this time of year.


63
0:6:18,79 --> 0:6:22,85
And again, one has to realize,
we are in Great Britain.


64
0:6:22,85 --> 0:6:24,52
And there's fucking
war on the street.


65
0:6:24,52 --> 0:6:31,29



66
0:6:31,29 --> 0:6:33,8
This just looks like it's
going to keep going, and


67
0:6:33,8 --> 0:6:35,72
going, and going, until these
kids get so tired that they


68
0:6:35,72 --> 0:6:36,97
can't throw any more rocks.


69
0:6:36,97 --> 0:7:12,88



70
0:7:12,88 --> 0:7:18,82
[LAUGHTER]


71
0:7:18,82 --> 0:7:20,31
MALE SPEAKER: He says he's
not a man of vows.


72
0:7:20,31 --> 0:7:20,58
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]


73
0:7:20,58 --> 0:7:22,37
on the other side
of your face.


74
0:7:22,37 --> 0:7:23,87
MALE SPEAKER: What happened
in Ardoyne for


75
0:7:23,87 --> 0:7:25,54
instance, last night?


76
0:7:25,54 --> 0:7:26,51
There's a number
of [INAUDIBLE]


77
0:7:26,51 --> 0:7:26,83
reasons.


78
0:7:26,83 --> 0:7:28,29
There's not just one reason.


79
0:7:28,29 --> 0:7:31,29
Yes, some of it is kids
venting steam.


80
0:7:31,29 --> 0:7:34,66
And the reality is, it's
exciting for young people.


81
0:7:34,66 --> 0:7:37,32
They're looking up at the people
in their community.


82
0:7:37,32 --> 0:7:39,4
They want to feel important
in their community.


83
0:7:39,4 --> 0:7:40,45
They want to be known.


84
0:7:40,45 --> 0:7:43,9
There's a huge gap between
what's happening on the ground


85
0:7:43,9 --> 0:7:46,215
in young people's lives and
what's happening at the top


86
0:7:46,215 --> 0:7:48,21
politically.


87
0:7:48,21 --> 0:7:50,77
As an uneasy calm returned to
Belfast, we talked to some


88
0:7:50,77 --> 0:7:53,32
Catholic kids who went to the
riots in Ardoyne just as


89
0:7:53,32 --> 0:7:54,4
spectators.


90
0:7:54,4 --> 0:7:55,88
They helped us to code
the local graffiti.


91
0:7:55,88 --> 0:7:59,29



92
0:7:59,29 --> 0:8:1,84
MALE SPEAKER: And Huns
are Protestants?


93
0:8:1,84 --> 0:8:1,541
MALE SPEAKER: OK.


94
0:8:1,541 --> 0:8:2,89
And do you know why you
call them Huns?


95
0:8:2,89 --> 0:8:7,2



96
0:8:7,2 --> 0:8:8,16
MALE SPEAKER: All right.


97
0:8:8,16 --> 0:8:10,39
And there's a bunch of these.


98
0:8:10,39 --> 0:8:12,16
You see this all
over the place.


99
0:8:12,16 --> 0:8:17,656



100
0:8:17,656 --> 0:8:20,68
[DOG BARKING]


101
0:8:20,68 --> 0:8:22,93
MALE SPEAKER: Does it seem like
anything was accomplished


102
0:8:22,93 --> 0:8:24,56
the next day after, for
instance, after


103
0:8:24,56 --> 0:8:25,81
Ardoyne this year?


104
0:8:25,81 --> 0:8:39,539



105
0:8:39,539 --> 0:8:40,58
MALE SPEAKER: Why do you
guys go over there?


106
0:8:40,58 --> 0:8:41,943
You don't live right in
that neighborhood.


107
0:8:41,943 --> 0:8:47,85



108
0:8:47,85 --> 0:8:50,18
MALE SPEAKER: If either of you
went to your father and said,


109
0:8:50,18 --> 0:8:51,88
I want to join the paramilitary
organization,


110
0:8:51,88 --> 0:8:54,79
specifically continuity,
for instance.


111
0:8:54,79 --> 0:8:56,4
What would he say?


112
0:8:56,4 --> 0:9:8,97



113
0:9:8,97 --> 0:9:10,74
MALE SPEAKER: So you're a
liability to the organization?


114
0:9:10,74 --> 0:9:19,56



115
0:9:19,56 --> 0:9:21,93
MALE SPEAKER: So if you had a
gun, you would go down and


116
0:9:21,93 --> 0:9:23,18
shoot as many as you could?


117
0:9:23,18 --> 0:9:35,9



118
0:9:35,9 --> 0:9:35,59
FEMALE SPEAKER: [SINGING]


119
0:9:35,59 --> 0:9:39,138
Oh, the water is wide.


120
0:9:39,138 --> 0:9:44,416
And I can't cross o'er.


121
0:9:44,416 --> 0:9:51,605
And either have high
wings to fly.


122
0:9:51,605 --> 0:9:54,37



123
0:9:54,37 --> 0:9:58,972
Give me a [INAUDIBLE]


124
0:9:58,972 --> 0:10:2,828
I can carry, too.


125
0:10:2,828 --> 0:10:9,11
And both shall go
my [INAUDIBLE].


126
0:10:9,11 --> 0:12:9,11
