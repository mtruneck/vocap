hold your head up high.

-Walk on.

Walk on with hope

GERRY MARSDEN: I was livin' in
New York doing the Ed Sullivan


12
0:0:49,76 --> 0:0:52,6
Show and the Liverpool
team were


13
0:0:52,6 --> 0:0:53,69
playing around the Americas.


14
0:0:53,69 --> 0:0:56,13
So I said to Ed, there's a
soccer team in here from


15
0:0:56,13 --> 0:0:58,9
England called Liverpool.


16
0:0:58,9 --> 0:1:1,33
Get them on stage, and we'll
sing "Walk Alone" with me.


17
0:1:1,33 --> 0:1:2,3
He said, OK.


18
0:1:2,3 --> 0:1:5,17
So we got the whole team on the
stage, and we sang "Walk


19
0:1:5,17 --> 0:1:6,61
Alone" on the Ed
Sullivan Show.


20
0:1:6,61 --> 0:1:10,36
Coming off, Bill Shankly said
to me, "Teddy, my son.


21
0:1:10,36 --> 0:1:15,2
I've given you a team, but
you've given us a song."

How are you?

My name is Gerry Marsden from
Gerry and the Pacemakers, and


30

you have the pleasure of being
in Liverpool Football Club's


31
0:1:50,16 --> 0:1:53,8
magnificent ground
called Anfield.


32
0:1:53,8 --> 0:1:54,2
Not many people get in here.


33
0:1:54,2 --> 0:1:57,66
In fact, through them
doors there, my team


34

walk in like gods.


35
0:1:59,74 --> 0:2:4,41

Look at these names
on the wall.


37
0:2:6,1 --> 0:2:7,219
Look.


38
0:2:7,219 --> 0:2:8,157
Look at them.


39
0:2:8,157 --> 0:2:10,509
They're wonderful.


40
0:2:10,509 --> 0:2:15,76
God himself, Mr. Bill
Shankly, what a man.


41
0:2:15,76 --> 0:2:17,54
He used to come to my
house for dinner.


42
0:2:17,54 --> 0:2:19,65
This is the European Kop.


43
0:2:19,65 --> 0:2:21,92
Everybody tries to win it.


44
0:2:21,92 --> 0:2:25,7
We won it so many times,
we give them back.


45
0:2:25,7 --> 0:2:26,92
Look at this sign.


46
0:2:26,92 --> 0:2:28,33
This is Anfield.


47
0:2:28,33 --> 0:2:31,509
Those other teams would come
and see it and go, uh-oh.


48
0:2:31,509 --> 0:2:37,0



49
0:2:37,0 --> 0:2:39,515
The holy of holies.


50
0:2:39,515 --> 0:2:41,38
Look at this ground.


51
0:2:41,38 --> 0:2:43,215
I mean, when you look at
it, you get frightened.


52
0:2:43,215 --> 0:2:45,24
Nevermind playing on it.


53
0:2:45,24 --> 0:2:48,78
Can you imagine coming here to
play Liverpool on that field?


54
0:2:48,78 --> 0:2:49,539
Your heart does that.

JAMES MCKENNA: Football's much
more than entertainment.


57
0:2:56,0 --> 0:2:57,83
It's part of who you are.


58
0:2:57,83 --> 0:3:0,236
My first picture in my dad's
arms when I was born was with


59
0:3:0,236 --> 0:3:1,79
a Liverpool scarf on.


60
0:3:1,79 --> 0:3:3,14
It's stuff that instills
in you.


61
0:3:3,14 --> 0:3:4,83
It's part of you, and
it always has been.


62
0:3:4,83 --> 0:3:6,12
You don't ask people the
question, what do you do?


63
0:3:6,12 --> 0:3:7,7
You ask them, who
do you support?


64
0:3:7,7 --> 0:3:10,38
Liverpool at the time, they used
to play the Top 10, and


65
0:3:10,38 --> 0:3:12,44
"You'll Never Walk Alone" was
number one, and they used to


66
0:3:12,44 --> 0:3:13,1
just sing along.


67
0:3:13,1 --> 0:3:14,935
Probably also just
liking the song.


68
0:3:14,935 --> 0:3:18,11
GERRY MARSDEN: Once I came to
the game one day, and they all


69
0:3:18,11 --> 0:3:22,222
sang at the Kop, and I thought
the Kop is singing our song.


70
0:3:22,222 --> 0:3:23,66
Wow.


71
0:3:23,66 --> 0:3:24,8
I was over the moon.


72
0:3:24,8 --> 0:3:27,4
Then when it went out of the Top
10, and that weekend, the


73
0:3:27,4 --> 0:3:29,255
Kop shouted, where's our song?


74
0:3:29,255 --> 0:3:31,4
Where's our song?


75
0:3:31,4 --> 0:3:32,62
So we had to put it back on.


76
0:3:32,62 --> 0:3:35,405
And from that day to this,
every home match, we play


77
0:3:35,405 --> 0:3:37,161
"You'll Never Walk Alone."


78
0:3:37,161 --> 0:3:39,566
You all know the words.


79
0:3:39,566 --> 0:3:42,452
You can all help just a bit,
if you don't mind.

think of what's gone on at

Liverpool, our history, our dark
times, our joyous times,


83
0:3:53,425 --> 0:3:54,76
that the words seemed to fit.


84
0:3:54,76 --> 0:3:56,16
It was like it was
meant to be.


85
0:3:56,16 --> 0:3:58,32
It was like that song was meant
to fit the Liverpool

through a storm, hold your


90
0:4:8,38 --> 0:4:9,32
head up high.


91
0:4:9,32 --> 0:4:11,1
Don't be afraid of the dark.


92
0:4:11,1 --> 0:4:11,88
And that's all great.


93
0:4:11,88 --> 0:4:12,79
That's what made this song.


94
0:4:12,79 --> 0:4:15,58
And also what made this song is
the build up-- the way it


95
0:4:15,58 --> 0:4:18,32
goes up to a great sound, and
that's what gets everybody


96
0:4:18,32 --> 0:4:21,17
going as it builds and
builds and builds.


97
0:4:21,17 --> 0:4:22,845
And the end is just wonderful.


98
0:4:22,845 --> 0:4:25,93
And that's why I think the
Kop picked it all up.


99
0:4:25,93 --> 0:4:27,6
Easy to sing.


100
0:4:27,6 --> 0:4:29,6
At the end, give it
a bit of rally.

someone who likes Liverpool,

has a Liverpool [INAUDIBLE], or
is from Liverpool, and it
