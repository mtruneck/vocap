[MUSIC PLAYING]


2
0:0:9,81 --> 0:0:13,19
I'll knock your territorial
army pussy all over the


3
0:0:13,19 --> 0:0:14,28
fucking town.


4
0:0:14,28 --> 0:0:16,74
Let's hook it up, get
in the ring, bear.


5
0:0:16,74 --> 0:0:19,54
Bear versus cobra, let's
get it fucking on.


6
0:0:19,54 --> 0:0:23,3



7
0:0:23,3 --> 0:0:26,35
Hi, I'm Steve Ludwin, I'm here
with Vice to respond to all


8
0:0:26,35 --> 0:0:29,23
the video comments to the
documentary "Getting High with


9
0:0:29,23 --> 0:0:31,65
Snake Venom." First off, I'd
like to say it's been really


10
0:0:31,65 --> 0:0:34,34
exciting, and the comments have
been amazing and quite


11
0:0:34,34 --> 0:0:35,96
cathartic for me to read.


12
0:0:35,96 --> 0:0:38,82
Some are super intelligent and
some are pretty super dumb.


13
0:0:38,82 --> 0:0:41,46
But, hey, I understand super
dumb, so we're going to answer


14
0:0:41,46 --> 0:0:43,21
all the questions,
hopefully, today.


15
0:0:43,21 --> 0:0:44,3
Here's one right here.


16
0:0:44,3 --> 0:0:47,52
It says, "How the fuck are you
still alive?" If I ever had


17
0:0:47,52 --> 0:0:50,1
another accident with snake
venom and I needed to go to


18
0:0:50,1 --> 0:0:51,55
the hospital, I wouldn't.


19
0:0:51,55 --> 0:0:54,78
And I've been in situations
already where normal people


20
0:0:54,78 --> 0:0:56,0
would have gone to
the hospital.


21
0:0:56,0 --> 0:0:59,0
I induced a heart attack, I've
had some serious breathing


22
0:0:59,0 --> 0:1:1,77
problems, like paralysis
on my lungs.


23
0:1:1,77 --> 0:1:4,25
And I actually thought to
myself, don't go and waste


24
0:1:4,25 --> 0:1:5,14
hospital time.


25
0:1:5,14 --> 0:1:6,77
You've done this to yourself.


26
0:1:6,77 --> 0:1:9,23
Don't be a pussy, ride it out.


27
0:1:9,23 --> 0:1:9,95
Here's another one.


28
0:1:9,95 --> 0:1:11,73
"FUUUUUUUCK!


29
0:1:11,73 --> 0:1:12,58
Just look at him


30
0:1:12,58 --> 0:1:13,93
shaking." And I was.


31
0:1:13,93 --> 0:1:16,96
My hands, as I was milking
the snakes--


32
0:1:16,96 --> 0:1:18,49
which are really dangerous
snakes.


33
0:1:18,49 --> 0:1:20,98
I definitely didn't want to
get bit live on camera.


34
0:1:20,98 --> 0:1:23,85
It was 9 o'clock in the
morning, there was an


35
0:1:23,85 --> 0:1:26,84
ambulance outside, and there
were two camera crew guys.


36
0:1:26,84 --> 0:1:30,68
The paramedics had to be there
for health and safety.


37
0:1:30,68 --> 0:1:32,435
But yes, I was shaking.


38
0:1:32,435 --> 0:1:34,34
I was shaking like fuck.


39
0:1:34,34 --> 0:1:35,89
But I don't shake.


40
0:1:35,89 --> 0:1:37,46
Whoo, I am shaking there.


41
0:1:37,46 --> 0:1:40,13
"I can't help relate the process
to a drug addiction.


42
0:1:40,13 --> 0:1:42,67
The glorification of injecting,
the fear and


43
0:1:42,67 --> 0:1:45,63
excitement at the same time,
all very reminiscent of a


44
0:1:45,63 --> 0:1:48,37
heroin addict." There's a lot
of people saying that I'm


45
0:1:48,37 --> 0:1:50,37
addicted to venom,
I'm an addict.


46
0:1:50,37 --> 0:1:51,76
That's not true.


47
0:1:51,76 --> 0:1:52,64
There's no way.


48
0:1:52,64 --> 0:1:53,61
It's not like a drug.


49
0:1:53,61 --> 0:1:56,2
I don't feel like, hey,
I need some venom.


50
0:1:56,2 --> 0:1:57,51
Here's an interesting
question.


51
0:1:57,51 --> 0:1:58,5
"Cool stuff.


52
0:1:58,5 --> 0:2:1,5
He's definitely some kind
of freak super-human!


53
0:2:1,5 --> 0:2:3,5
Is there some type of
Snake-Man super


54
0:2:3,5 --> 0:2:5,6
hero or action figure?


55
0:2:5,6 --> 0:2:7,89
If not, some comic illustrator
should make him into a


56
0:2:7,89 --> 0:2:9,63
superhero."


57
0:2:9,63 --> 0:2:11,22
Well, I'd total be
up for that.


58
0:2:11,22 --> 0:2:13,15
So Marvel, get in touch.


59
0:2:13,15 --> 0:2:17,26
The one strange thing that I
have noticed, I get these


60
0:2:17,26 --> 0:2:23,37
incredible cravings, usually
once a day now, for these.


61
0:2:23,37 --> 0:2:26,47
And I just sort of started
thinking to myself, well, the


62
0:2:26,47 --> 0:2:30,31
snakes are eating these
mice, so why can't I?


63
0:2:30,31 --> 0:2:32,5
It's good, it's protein
and stuff.


64
0:2:32,5 --> 0:2:34,925
And I find that I can knock
back quite a few mice.


65
0:2:34,925 --> 0:2:37,68



66
0:2:37,68 --> 0:2:39,94
They're good.


67
0:2:39,94 --> 0:2:40,95
They're really good.


68
0:2:40,95 --> 0:2:43,18
They're healthy.


69
0:2:43,18 --> 0:2:44,9
They were sort of
humanely killed.


70
0:2:44,9 --> 0:2:50,503
I think mice are the future.


71
0:2:50,503 --> 0:2:52,37
They taste like mice.


72
0:2:52,37 --> 0:2:55,11
"I bet his sperm
tastes weird."


73
0:2:55,11 --> 0:2:56,83
I don't know how
to answer that.


74
0:2:56,83 --> 0:2:58,35
I don't think it tastes
weird at all.


75
0:2:58,35 --> 0:3:1,42
I think it tastes like
pineapple juice.


76
0:3:1,42 --> 0:3:4,8
Here's one from grambo519.


77
0:3:4,8 --> 0:3:7,47
"Ever suck dick for
snake venom?" No.


78
0:3:7,47 --> 0:3:8,62
I mean, yes.


79
0:3:8,62 --> 0:3:9,74
Is that a trick question?


80
0:3:9,74 --> 0:3:10,9
That's a trick question,
right?


81
0:3:10,9 --> 0:3:13,87
Here's one from CatDonuts1234.


82
0:3:13,87 --> 0:3:15,91
CatDonuts, cool.


83
0:3:15,91 --> 0:3:16,22
"Awesome!


84
0:3:16,22 --> 0:3:17,21
He's 46?


85
0:3:17,21 --> 0:3:18,65
He looks 28."


86
0:3:18,65 --> 0:3:19,48
People don't believe me.


87
0:3:19,48 --> 0:3:21,0
I am 46 years old.


88
0:3:21,0 --> 0:3:23,13
I was born in 1966.


89
0:3:23,13 --> 0:3:24,31
What a year.


90
0:3:24,31 --> 0:3:27,17
I don't know, people ask, are
there anti-aging properties to


91
0:3:27,17 --> 0:3:28,6
snake venom?


92
0:3:28,6 --> 0:3:30,15
And the answer is yes.


93
0:3:30,15 --> 0:3:32,42
There has been an anti-aging
cream that's been on the


94
0:3:32,42 --> 0:3:35,77
market for the last six, seven
years that celebrities are


95
0:3:35,77 --> 0:3:38,17
using that contains
snake venom in it.


96
0:3:38,17 --> 0:3:39,16
It's a big seller.


97
0:3:39,16 --> 0:3:40,23
It's proven to work.


98
0:3:40,23 --> 0:3:43,3
So, does snake venom have
anti-aging properties?


99
0:3:43,3 --> 0:3:44,85
Apparently so.


100
0:3:44,85 --> 0:3:48,15
"Isn't this also sort
of animal abuse?"


101
0:3:48,15 --> 0:3:50,7
No, this isn't animal
abuse at all.


102
0:3:50,7 --> 0:3:51,79
I'd like to defend that.


103
0:3:51,79 --> 0:3:53,34
None of the snakes are hurt.


104
0:3:53,34 --> 0:3:55,96
They're all kept in a
naturalistic way.


105
0:3:55,96 --> 0:3:58,93
You saw a lot them were in
those little containers--


106
0:3:58,93 --> 0:4:0,97
that was just to transport
them into the


107
0:4:0,97 --> 0:4:2,85
room where I was milking.


108
0:4:2,85 --> 0:4:4,79
All the animals are
well looked after.


109
0:4:4,79 --> 0:4:6,94
It is not animal abuse.


110
0:4:6,94 --> 0:4:9,31
Here's a question from Mat397.


111
0:4:9,31 --> 0:4:11,8
"Hey, Steve, is there a main
goal you would like to achieve


112
0:4:11,8 --> 0:4:13,7
with doing snake venom
injections?"


113
0:4:13,7 --> 0:4:15,5
I would like to take it further


114
0:4:15,5 --> 0:4:17,42
and research it properly--


115
0:4:17,42 --> 0:4:19,7
like I said in the
documentary--


116
0:4:19,7 --> 0:4:22,45
with a forward-thinking company,
open-minded company,


117
0:4:22,45 --> 0:4:24,9
and see if there is any
medicinal value.


118
0:4:24,9 --> 0:4:26,69
That's what I'd like
to achieve.


119
0:4:26,69 --> 0:4:30,35
"Could you make antivenom
with his blood?"


120
0:4:30,35 --> 0:4:31,62
I think that's an interesting
question.


121
0:4:31,62 --> 0:4:33,76
That's what I would
like to research.


122
0:4:33,76 --> 0:4:37,54
I'd like to see if I have
reached a level of immunity to


123
0:4:37,54 --> 0:4:40,15
the snake venom in my blood
that can be used to help


124
0:4:40,15 --> 0:4:41,24
somebody else.


125
0:4:41,24 --> 0:4:43,54
We know that that's possible
because Bill Haast has


126
0:4:43,54 --> 0:4:44,38
already done it.


127
0:4:44,38 --> 0:4:47,95
But I would like to see at what
level my blood could be


128
0:4:47,95 --> 0:4:51,58
used to make an antivenom, or
to fight anything off, for


129
0:4:51,58 --> 0:4:52,5
that matter.


130
0:4:52,5 --> 0:4:55,73
"Steve, have you experimented
with any venom from animals


131
0:4:55,73 --> 0:4:57,51
other than snakes?"


132
0:4:57,51 --> 0:4:58,71
No, I haven't yet.


133
0:4:58,71 --> 0:5:1,3
But I think it is really amazing
that the possibilities


134
0:5:1,3 --> 0:5:2,72
of doing so in the future.


135
0:5:2,72 --> 0:5:4,92
There are millions
of undiscovered


136
0:5:4,92 --> 0:5:6,84
compounds in all venoms.


137
0:5:6,84 --> 0:5:7,91
It's not just snake venom.


138
0:5:7,91 --> 0:5:11,16
There's sea anemones, there's
cone shells, there's


139
0:5:11,16 --> 0:5:11,73
everything.


140
0:5:11,73 --> 0:5:14,4
All the venomous animals on
the planet, I think their


141
0:5:14,4 --> 0:5:15,92
venom should be studied.


142
0:5:15,92 --> 0:5:18,66
What can kill you can
also save you.


143
0:5:18,66 --> 0:5:20,99
One of the really alarming
things about this


144
0:5:20,99 --> 0:5:21,59
documentary--


145
0:5:21,59 --> 0:5:25,25
and I suppose I kind of knew
that it was going to happen--


146
0:5:25,25 --> 0:5:28,3
was the alarming amount of
people that were saying, this


147
0:5:28,3 --> 0:5:30,81
is cool, I'm going
to try this.


148
0:5:30,81 --> 0:5:34,12
I definitely, definitely don't
want anyone to try it.


149
0:5:34,12 --> 0:5:35,14
I don't think you should.


150
0:5:35,14 --> 0:5:38,82
Like I said, I have over 25
years of experience working


151
0:5:38,82 --> 0:5:40,36
with venomous snakes.


152
0:5:40,36 --> 0:5:42,2
People are asking, what
snakes do you use?


153
0:5:42,2 --> 0:5:43,66
This isn't a cooking show.


154
0:5:43,66 --> 0:5:45,37
There's no recipe here, OK?


155
0:5:45,37 --> 0:5:48,19
So don't fuck up, because
you will be underground.


156
0:5:48,19 --> 0:5:49,88
And I don't want it to
be someone who was


157
0:5:49,88 --> 0:5:51,91
influenced by me.


158
0:5:51,91 --> 0:5:52,53
All right, guys.


159
0:5:52,53 --> 0:5:53,31
Thanks a lot.


160
0:5:53,31 --> 0:5:56,6
Thanks a lot for watching,
thanks a lot for sending in


161
0:5:56,6 --> 0:5:56,81
all your questions.


162
0:5:56,81 --> 0:5:59,5
This has been Steve
Ludwin and Vice.


163
0:5:59,5 --> 0:6:1,36
And what else can I say?


164
0:6:1,36 --> 0:6:2,707
One last thing--


165
0:6:2,707 --> 0:6:5,9
don't be a dickhammer.


166
0:6:5,9 --> 0:8:5,9
