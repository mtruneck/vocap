[SKATEBOARD SOUNDS]


2
0:0:11,8 --> 0:0:14,1
MALE SPEAKER 1: Tell me about
leaving H-Street.


3
0:0:14,1 --> 0:0:16,58
Did you have your eyes
on World Companies?


4
0:0:16,58 --> 0:0:17,89
ERIC KOSTON: No.


5
0:0:17,89 --> 0:0:23,86
I think there was things about
H-Street that were starting to


6
0:0:23,86 --> 0:0:26,31
kind of be over, getting
a little older


7
0:0:26,31 --> 0:0:28,5
and having an opinion.


8
0:0:28,5 --> 0:0:30,91
I was skating with Danny a
little bit at the time, Danny


9
0:0:30,91 --> 0:0:33,52
Way, myself and Alph, just
skating with them.


10
0:0:33,52 --> 0:0:35,59
And one night after we were
skating, we were eating


11
0:0:35,59 --> 0:0:38,91
somewhere venting
about H-Street.


12
0:0:38,91 --> 0:0:41,9
And he was like, I'll call Steve
Rocco right now, get you


13
0:0:41,9 --> 0:0:42,156
guys on World.


14
0:0:42,156 --> 0:0:45,89
I was like, really?


15
0:0:45,89 --> 0:0:48,86
And he pulls out-- he
had a cell phone.


16
0:0:48,86 --> 0:0:49,705
A little flip--


17
0:0:49,705 --> 0:0:51,53
a big, thick flip
Motorola, too.


18
0:0:51,53 --> 0:0:53,57
I was like, oh, he's
got a cell phone.


19
0:0:53,57 --> 0:0:54,51
It's crazy.


20
0:0:54,51 --> 0:0:56,19
So he calls Rocco.


21
0:0:56,19 --> 0:0:59,64
Rocco told Danny, he was like
we can't put him on World


22
0:0:59,64 --> 0:1:3,37
because Natas is interested
in Eric.


23
0:1:3,37 --> 0:1:5,51
Natas wants him on 101.


24
0:1:5,51 --> 0:1:8,22
I was like, really, Natas
wants me on 101?


25
0:1:8,22 --> 0:1:11,98
MALE SPEAKER 1: Was that trippy
to know that Natas was


26
0:1:11,98 --> 0:1:13,45
thinking about your skating?


27
0:1:13,45 --> 0:1:13,85
ERIC KOSTON: Yeah.


28
0:1:13,85 --> 0:1:14,16
Yeah.


29
0:1:14,16 --> 0:1:15,34
It was pretty crazy.


30
0:1:15,34 --> 0:1:17,47
I was like, oh my god.


31
0:1:17,47 --> 0:1:21,28
Then I had to make a phone
call to Natas.


32
0:1:21,28 --> 0:1:25,24
Danny got me his number, and
was like, yeah, Natas wants


33
0:1:25,24 --> 0:1:26,52
you to call him.


34
0:1:26,52 --> 0:1:30,96
So once the option was there,
I was like, man,


35
0:1:30,96 --> 0:1:33,19
this is kind of rad.


36
0:1:33,19 --> 0:1:34,66
I want to do that.


37
0:1:34,66 --> 0:1:39,48
I fought it for a while, but I
got to man up and do what I


38
0:1:39,48 --> 0:1:40,0
want to do.


39
0:1:40,0 --> 0:1:41,88
Because in my heart, that's
what I wanted to do.


40
0:1:41,88 --> 0:1:43,13
I wanted to quit.


41
0:1:43,13 --> 0:1:48,65



42
0:1:48,65 --> 0:1:51,1
ALPHONZO RAWLS: Koston was
always a really quiet kid.


43
0:1:51,1 --> 0:1:53,23
He never really showed his
emotions and stuff.


44
0:1:53,23 --> 0:1:58,43
And I remember when he was
quitting H-Street, and having


45
0:1:58,43 --> 0:2:0,11
to talk to Mag about it.


46
0:2:0,11 --> 0:2:2,65
Koston knew it was probably
the best move to


47
0:2:2,65 --> 0:2:4,3
make for his career.


48
0:2:4,3 --> 0:2:5,15
I kind of felt for him.


49
0:2:5,15 --> 0:2:7,78
I just sensed it was a really
uncomfortable phone call for


50
0:2:7,78 --> 0:2:9,91
him, being that he really wanted
to give Mag all the


51
0:2:9,91 --> 0:2:14,69
respect that he felt he owed him
for taking care of him for


52
0:2:14,69 --> 0:2:15,95
as long as he did.


53
0:2:15,95 --> 0:2:18,52
It was definitely a strong
movement that was a good move


54
0:2:18,52 --> 0:2:19,92
for his future.


55
0:2:19,92 --> 0:2:22,21
ERIC KOSTON: I was
pretty into 101.


56
0:2:22,21 --> 0:2:24,7
When it started, it was like,
wow, this is sick.


57
0:2:24,7 --> 0:2:27,66
It's Natas's company,
and it's smaller.


58
0:2:27,66 --> 0:2:28,91
It was just cool to me.


59
0:2:28,91 --> 0:2:30,69
It was Natas.


60
0:2:30,69 --> 0:2:31,67
Duh.


61
0:2:31,67 --> 0:2:34,552
And it was just rad, and just,
the team being different, and


62
0:2:34,552 --> 0:2:35,6
it's smaller.


63
0:2:35,6 --> 0:2:37,42
Just everything about it.


64
0:2:37,42 --> 0:2:39,9
GUY MARIANO: Natas always kept
101 really separate.


65
0:2:39,9 --> 0:2:41,49
Their videos were different.


66
0:2:41,49 --> 0:2:44,9
Their art direction
was different.


67
0:2:44,9 --> 0:2:46,81
ERIC KOSTON: If I came up with
an idea, Cliver and McKee


68
0:2:46,81 --> 0:2:48,31
would draw it.


69
0:2:48,31 --> 0:2:49,3
That was pretty rad.


70
0:2:49,3 --> 0:2:52,93
I remember this hockey violent
fight riot graphic.


71
0:2:52,93 --> 0:2:53,9
I came up with it.


72
0:2:53,9 --> 0:2:55,5
Let's just have a super
violent-- like, having a


73
0:2:55,5 --> 0:2:59,23
hockey stick, stab it through
a guy's chest.


74
0:2:59,23 --> 0:3:1,16
And there's a hockey puck flying
through his chest,


75
0:3:1,16 --> 0:3:3,337
because there's a guy behind
him, that just hammered a puck


76
0:3:3,337 --> 0:3:4,6
through his chest.


77
0:3:4,6 --> 0:3:5,85
And then there's other guys
slashing each other, and


78
0:3:5,85 --> 0:3:7,25
there's just blood.


79
0:3:7,25 --> 0:3:10,29
And they were doing all those
graphics that were just so


80
0:3:10,29 --> 0:3:13,75
super, just gore.


81
0:3:13,75 --> 0:3:15,61
It was cool, though.


82
0:3:15,61 --> 0:3:20,5
Any stupid idea I had
would be created.


83
0:3:20,5 --> 0:3:21,86
I don't know if you remember
the board, it


84
0:3:21,86 --> 0:3:23,63
was just a pot leaf.


85
0:3:23,63 --> 0:3:27,61
And it's color blocked
red, yellow, green.


86
0:3:27,61 --> 0:3:31,14
I didn't smoke weed at all.


87
0:3:31,14 --> 0:3:32,26
I don't.


88
0:3:32,26 --> 0:3:33,44
I have.


89
0:3:33,44 --> 0:3:34,8
It was just a joke.


90
0:3:34,8 --> 0:3:38,82
It's like, any joke you can
come up, you just make it.


91
0:3:38,82 --> 0:3:40,56
It actually did really well.


92
0:3:40,56 --> 0:3:41,91
GUY MARIANO: Eric being
with Natas--


93
0:3:41,91 --> 0:3:43,51
like, Natas is such
a rad dude.


94
0:3:43,51 --> 0:3:47,99
And to go from Eddie Elguera,
like a positive role model, to


95
0:3:47,99 --> 0:3:51,1
Natas Kaupas, who was a little
bit edgier, but still such a


96
0:3:51,1 --> 0:3:53,21
rad dude, so inspirational.


97
0:3:53,21 --> 0:3:56,4
Having that rubbed off on Eric,
too, only made Eric so


98
0:3:56,4 --> 0:3:58,4
much better of a person.


99
0:3:58,4 --> 0:4:0,19
ERIC KOSTON: He was the complete
opposite of the


100
0:4:0,19 --> 0:4:1,64
Tenasky type.


101
0:4:1,64 --> 0:4:7,15
He's very laid-back and super
mellow about things.


102
0:4:7,15 --> 0:4:8,6
It was different .


103
0:4:8,6 --> 0:4:13,19
Yeah, it was like, so yeah, hey,
I think we're going to do


104
0:4:13,19 --> 0:4:14,44
another video.


105
0:4:14,44 --> 0:4:16,31



106
0:4:16,31 --> 0:4:18,269
MALE SPEAKER 1: Was the Falling
Down part-- would you


107
0:4:18,269 --> 0:4:21,42
say that that was a
breakthrough part?


108
0:4:21,42 --> 0:4:23,9
ERIC KOSTON: Yeah, I think
it was more of a


109
0:4:23,9 --> 0:4:24,6
breakthrough part.


110
0:4:24,6 --> 0:4:27,54
Because the first 101 video, the
skating at that time was


111
0:4:27,54 --> 0:4:32,4
still that technical but sloppy
and goofy boy looking.


112
0:4:32,4 --> 0:4:34,42
Bad late flips, and pressure
flips, and stuff that was


113
0:4:34,42 --> 0:4:37,57
really bouncy, and
gross, and slow.


114
0:4:37,57 --> 0:4:40,48
The bad outfits, rave pants.


115
0:4:40,48 --> 0:4:44,24
And then Falling Down is when it
started to polish itself up


116
0:4:44,24 --> 0:4:45,3
a little bit.


117
0:4:45,3 --> 0:4:48,13
You started popping flip tricks
a little higher, and


118
0:4:48,13 --> 0:4:50,18
everything got a
little cleaner.


119
0:4:50,18 --> 0:4:51,57
It started to speed up.


120
0:4:51,57 --> 0:4:53,3
I think that's just what--


121
0:4:53,3 --> 0:4:54,71
also, it evolved.


122
0:4:54,71 --> 0:4:55,63
Skating did.


123
0:4:55,63 --> 0:4:57,81
AARON MEZA: Falling Down is
the one where he's super


124
0:4:57,81 --> 0:4:58,71
killing it.


125
0:4:58,71 --> 0:5:1,452
Yeah, by the time that 101 video
came out, it was like a


126
0:5:1,452 --> 0:5:3,62
done deal that he
was the best.


127
0:5:3,62 --> 0:5:5,86
GUY MARIANO: I remember when
that 101 part came out with


128
0:5:5,86 --> 0:5:7,19
that Gang Starr song.


129
0:5:7,19 --> 0:5:8,61
And I seen Eric skating.


130
0:5:8,61 --> 0:5:11,31
And I'm just like, whoa, this
dude is unbelievable.


131
0:5:11,31 --> 0:5:12,3
I remember that one clip.


132
0:5:12,3 --> 0:5:16,57
He did a backside 180
5-0 half cab flip.


133
0:5:16,57 --> 0:5:19,98
A lot of people around today
that don't do that trick.


134
0:5:19,98 --> 0:5:23,18
Around that time, I think Eric
was definitely one of the


135
0:5:23,18 --> 0:5:27,85
persons that was going switch
and nollie-ing into things.


136
0:5:27,85 --> 0:5:31,38
Like, way above what everybody
else was doing at the time.


137
0:5:31,38 --> 0:5:34,16
MIKE CARROLL: I think everything
in that video part


138
0:5:34,16 --> 0:5:35,28
was gnarly.


139
0:5:35,28 --> 0:5:38,29
The frontside shove-it off that
bump, and the kickflip


140
0:5:38,29 --> 0:5:40,12
just popped super good.


141
0:5:40,12 --> 0:5:43,4
At that time, a lot of people
were just learning new tricks.


142
0:5:43,4 --> 0:5:46,34
And at that time, no one was
really doing anything as good


143
0:5:46,34 --> 0:5:48,66
as the way he did it
in that video part.


144
0:5:48,66 --> 0:5:51,87
And it was just like, OK,
that's how you skate.


145
0:5:51,87 --> 0:5:53,8
GUY MARIANO: He was already
doing lines with a lot of


146
0:5:53,8 --> 0:5:55,95
harder tricks in them that
might have been people's


147
0:5:55,95 --> 0:5:56,83
single tricks.


148
0:5:56,83 --> 0:5:59,96
I remember there was one, I
don't know if it was Eden


149
0:5:59,96 --> 0:6:1,57
Gardens or something,
like some of those


150
0:6:1,57 --> 0:6:3,2
lines in San Diego.


151
0:6:3,2 --> 0:6:4,335
Really good.


152
0:6:4,335 --> 0:6:6,78
MALE SPEAKER 1: It seemed like
for me, the thing that blew my


153
0:6:6,78 --> 0:6:9,4
mind was the switch 360
flip down the seven.


154
0:6:9,4 --> 0:6:11,23
ERIC KOSTON: Not many people
were flying it


155
0:6:11,23 --> 0:6:13,28
down things, I guess.


156
0:6:13,28 --> 0:6:15,4
ALPHONZO RAWLS: That was the
trip that we took together up


157
0:6:15,4 --> 0:6:16,2
in San Francisco.


158
0:6:16,2 --> 0:6:17,26
I remember that happening.


159
0:6:17,26 --> 0:6:21,8
And that was the most amazing
thing at the time.


160
0:6:21,8 --> 0:6:24,11
Not many people were even doing
that trick, let alone


161
0:6:24,11 --> 0:6:24,73
down the seven.


162
0:6:24,73 --> 0:6:27,24
So that was some next level
shit at that point.


163
0:6:27,24 --> 0:6:30,43
That's kind of when you knew
that oh, this guy, he's going


164
0:6:30,43 --> 0:6:32,34
to be around for many
years to come.


165
0:6:32,34 --> 0:6:34,53
MIKE CARROLL: I was down in
Embarcadero when he switch


166
0:6:34,53 --> 0:6:36,153
tred the seven.


167
0:6:36,153 --> 0:6:36,92
MALE SPEAKER 1: Oh,
you saw it?


168
0:6:36,92 --> 0:6:37,56
MIKE CARROLL: Yeah.


169
0:6:37,56 --> 0:6:41,63
I mean doing it down that
was sick, for sure.


170
0:6:41,63 --> 0:6:42,81
But I remember tripping.


171
0:6:42,81 --> 0:6:46,14
Like, damn, he's so much better
than how he did that


172
0:6:46,14 --> 0:6:47,29
switch tre.


173
0:6:47,29 --> 0:6:49,2
ALPHONZO RAWLS: I remember it
being pretty damn perfect.


174
0:6:49,2 --> 0:6:53,47
But I mean I guess that said, me
knowing Koston and knowing


175
0:6:53,47 --> 0:6:57,44
what he's able to do, I think
as dope as his video parts


176
0:6:57,44 --> 0:7:0,49
are, it is just a small
piece of what that


177
0:7:0,49 --> 0:7:1,61
guy is able to do.


178
0:7:1,61 --> 0:7:3,57
GUY MARIANO: I think when Eric
came over from H-Street to


179
0:7:3,57 --> 0:7:7,29
101, still, I didn't know
Eric really well.


180
0:7:7,29 --> 0:7:9,68
I think at that point,
I was still really


181
0:7:9,68 --> 0:7:11,22
intimidated by Eric.


182
0:7:11,22 --> 0:7:14,81
MIKE CARROLL: We probably never
came across each other


183
0:7:14,81 --> 0:7:19,35
that often when he was on 101
and I was on Plan B. I knew


184
0:7:19,35 --> 0:7:22,23
him, but we didn't talk
to each other.


185
0:7:22,23 --> 0:7:23,67
Talk to each other like,
oh, yeah, what are


186
0:7:23,67 --> 0:7:24,82
you going to do later?


187
0:7:24,82 --> 0:7:27,42
No, I definitely wasn't
kicking it with him.


188
0:7:27,42 --> 0:7:28,8
ALPHONZO RAWLS: For a lack of
better term, he was probably a


189
0:7:28,8 --> 0:7:31,69
little bit nerdier back then.


190
0:7:31,69 --> 0:7:34,41
So I think that some of those
dudes picked up on it and


191
0:7:34,41 --> 0:7:40,3
probably took it for weakness
or whatever.


192
0:7:40,3 --> 0:7:43,58
And I think Koston really wasn't
focused on it, or just


193
0:7:43,58 --> 0:7:46,47
oblivious to the fact these
guys were hating on him.


194
0:7:46,47 --> 0:7:49,11
But me being a little bit older,
I just kind of sensed


195
0:7:49,11 --> 0:7:53,41
that these guys don't
fucking like my boy.


196
0:7:53,41 --> 0:7:58,94
And so I just thought it was
kind of interesting, years


197
0:7:58,94 --> 0:8:3,505
later, that they became
such a close group.


198
0:8:3,505 --> 0:8:5,31
KELLY BIRD: People knew he was
fucking good, but I think


199
0:8:5,31 --> 0:8:9,78
people just wanted a reason
to hate on him, I guess.


200
0:8:9,78 --> 0:8:12,26
But I know there was definitely
some years of


201
0:8:12,26 --> 0:8:17,17
trying to deny the fact that
he was as good as he was.


202
