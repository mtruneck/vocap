1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:1,78



2
0:0:1,78 --> 0:0:3,68
Expert with a knife will always
take a man with a gun


3
0:0:3,68 --> 0:0:6,17
within 20 feet, always,
on the draw.


4
0:0:6,17 --> 0:0:9,76
You won't draw leather on your
nine Glock before I draw


5
0:0:9,76 --> 0:0:11,43
leather on my knife
and kill you.


6
0:0:11,43 --> 0:0:12,68
Simple fact.


7
0:0:12,68 --> 0:0:16,1



8
0:0:16,1 --> 0:0:22,61
I mean, you're not going to
pull it out straight out.


9
0:0:22,61 --> 0:0:24,12
That's in there.


10
0:0:24,12 --> 0:0:26,92
You're going to lean on that.


11
0:0:26,92 --> 0:0:28,81
You're not going to do it.


12
0:0:28,81 --> 0:0:30,73
That's how deep it goes in.


13
0:0:30,73 --> 0:0:32,189
And that's a Bowie.


14
0:0:32,189 --> 0:0:33,74
That against any man
would've been dead.


15
0:0:33,74 --> 0:0:36,9
He'd have been dead already.


16
0:0:36,9 --> 0:0:38,65
That's a lot of knife
coming on you.


17
0:0:38,65 --> 0:0:57,95



18
0:0:57,95 --> 0:0:58,9
I have two sides.


19
0:0:58,9 --> 0:0:59,82
I have no middle ground.


20
0:0:59,82 --> 0:1:1,36
I am pure light and
pure darkness.


21
0:1:1,36 --> 0:1:2,7
I cry for people
in the streets.


22
0:1:2,7 --> 0:1:4,5
I hate poverty.


23
0:1:4,5 --> 0:1:5,99
I hate children that
don't eat.


24
0:1:5,99 --> 0:1:7,17
It drives me crazy.


25
0:1:7,17 --> 0:1:9,27
It breaks my heart to
see children suffer.


26
0:1:9,27 --> 0:1:10,5
I love people.


27
0:1:10,5 --> 0:1:12,5
Walk on the wrong way--


28
0:1:12,5 --> 0:1:13,58
yeah, I'm one dark bastard.


29
0:1:13,58 --> 0:1:17,38



30
0:1:17,38 --> 0:1:19,48
I didn't choose when
I got attacked.


31
0:1:19,48 --> 0:1:21,44
The only thing experts agree
on is-- with a black


32
0:1:21,44 --> 0:1:23,16
bear, you never run.


33
0:1:23,16 --> 0:1:24,76
A black bear, you
never play dead.


34
0:1:24,76 --> 0:1:26,86
A black bear, you always
show aggression.


35
0:1:26,86 --> 0:1:28,15
This is 100% of the time.


36
0:1:28,15 --> 0:1:29,26
Not so with a grizzly.


37
0:1:29,26 --> 0:1:31,65
Your best chance, if it's a
female, you see the cub or


38
0:1:31,65 --> 0:1:32,7
not, yeah, play dead.


39
0:1:32,7 --> 0:1:33,96
Whether it was my
martial arts.


40
0:1:33,96 --> 0:1:34,66
Whether it's just--


41
0:1:34,66 --> 0:1:36,28
I'm one pissy son of a bitch.


42
0:1:36,28 --> 0:1:36,92
I don't know.


43
0:1:36,92 --> 0:1:38,78
I don't know anything about
grizzlies back then.


44
0:1:38,78 --> 0:1:39,98
I'm still a teenager,
you know?


45
0:1:39,98 --> 0:1:43,16
And I can feel the sense
for days, you know?


46
0:1:43,16 --> 0:1:43,848
It's quiet.


47
0:1:43,848 --> 0:1:46,94
It's a stillness.


48
0:1:46,94 --> 0:1:48,48
I look at this grizzly.


49
0:1:48,48 --> 0:1:50,48
And then he just moves in
on me-- just smash,


50
0:1:50,48 --> 0:1:52,78
right in the chest.


51
0:1:52,78 --> 0:1:54,18
All of sudden, something
hits me.


52
0:1:54,18 --> 0:1:56,92
One of my senseis said, there
will come a time in an


53
0:1:56,92 --> 0:2:1,64
individual's life where
anger supersedes fear.


54
0:2:1,64 --> 0:2:4,84
And that's when you
stand or fall.


55
0:2:4,84 --> 0:2:7,505
And it was beautiful,
it really was.


56
0:2:7,505 --> 0:2:10,34
Just let the knapsack go, looked
at this animal, and


57
0:2:10,34 --> 0:2:12,343
said, piss on you.


58
0:2:12,343 --> 0:2:14,83
It ain't going to happen.


59
0:2:14,83 --> 0:2:19,83
I had my Bowie, and
I had a machete.


60
0:2:19,83 --> 0:2:21,346
And I walked up to him.


61
0:2:21,346 --> 0:2:24,69
I said, man, your fighting
prowess is 50 times mine.


62
0:2:24,69 --> 0:2:26,67
But pal, I'm good enough to
stick both these in you.


63
0:2:26,67 --> 0:2:28,91
And he just gave me that look,
and his head kind of


64
0:2:28,91 --> 0:2:30,105
went back and forth.


65
0:2:30,105 --> 0:2:34,49
And he turned 180 degrees,
and he was just gone.


66
0:2:34,49 --> 0:2:36,256
I just watched him walk off.


67
0:2:36,256 --> 0:2:39,54
And it was almost a-- oh man,
the stillness, the quiet was


68
0:2:39,54 --> 0:2:40,17
unbelievable.


69
0:2:40,17 --> 0:2:41,645
You see, that's the
wilderness.


70
0:2:41,645 --> 0:2:43,2
That's what brings us.


71
0:2:43,2 --> 0:2:45,85
You can get those-- it's like,
wow, OK, this is cool.


72
0:2:45,85 --> 0:2:47,1
This is what it's all about.


73
0:2:47,1 --> 0:2:49,67



74
0:2:49,67 --> 0:2:50,965
So I wanted to learn more
about this bear.


75
0:2:50,965 --> 0:2:52,22
I wanted to know why.


76
0:2:52,22 --> 0:2:54,21
I went back to college.


77
0:2:54,21 --> 0:2:55,14
I had quit in grade 10.


78
0:2:55,14 --> 0:2:57,21
So I had to go upgrading
all over again.


79
0:2:57,21 --> 0:2:59,696
And what I found out, there was
not a damn thing known on


80
0:2:59,696 --> 0:3:0,632
the grizzly.


81
0:3:0,632 --> 0:3:2,96
You can't get close enough
to study them.


82
0:3:2,96 --> 0:3:3,875
They'd kill you.


83
0:3:3,875 --> 0:3:6,43
Well, I'm watching RoboCop.


84
0:3:6,43 --> 0:3:8,64
And I'm telling you, halfway
through that movie, it just


85
0:3:8,64 --> 0:3:9,65
all came together.


86
0:3:9,65 --> 0:3:13,12
I just looked at that
and said, that's it.


87
0:3:13,12 --> 0:3:14,58
You give me the time
and the money, I'm


88
0:3:14,58 --> 0:3:15,26
going to build a suit.


89
0:3:15,26 --> 0:3:16,51
That's how it all started.


90
0:3:16,51 --> 0:3:37,4



91
0:3:37,4 --> 0:3:40,886
1987-88, I watched Robocop, I
started building the bear


92
0:3:40,886 --> 0:3:42,51
suits for grizzly
bear research.


93
0:3:42,51 --> 0:3:45,82
I am the world's foremost
authority on deterrent sprays


94
0:3:45,82 --> 0:3:47,12
sold to the public.


95
0:3:47,12 --> 0:3:50,32
So I started building it-- the
Mark III, the Mark IV.


96
0:3:50,32 --> 0:3:53,3
It's all soft material
for flexibility.


97
0:3:53,3 --> 0:3:54,95
You learn a lot, 25
years at this.


98
0:3:54,95 --> 0:3:57,51
I mean, I've got 25 years ahead
of anybody out there.


99
0:3:57,51 --> 0:3:59,98
And by the time I got to the
M VII, you're looking at


100
0:3:59,98 --> 0:4:4,7
$150,000, straight titanium.


101
0:4:4,7 --> 0:4:11,11
Again, only about 20%
flexibility, 135 pounds.


102
0:4:11,11 --> 0:4:14,19
But I only need to be able to
stand there, raise the arm.


103
0:4:14,19 --> 0:4:16,89
There's a trigger device that
sends off the spray.


104
0:4:16,89 --> 0:4:18,12
That's the research I do--


105
0:4:18,12 --> 0:4:20,61
and in aggressive behavioral
research, what happens


106
0:4:20,61 --> 0:4:22,25
afterwards, if it gets
through, what


107
0:4:22,25 --> 0:4:23,5
does the bear do.


108
0:4:23,5 --> 0:4:28,568



109
0:4:28,568 --> 0:4:31,1
[INDISTINCT SHOUTING]


110
0:4:31,1 --> 0:4:33,24
Troy goes to McMaster
University.


111
0:4:33,24 --> 0:4:35,16
That's our MIT.


112
0:4:35,16 --> 0:4:37,8
And I go to doctors
in physics.


113
0:4:37,8 --> 0:4:40,76
So I present the problem to
them, and they love it.


114
0:4:40,76 --> 0:4:41,8
Wow, that's brilliant.


115
0:4:41,8 --> 0:4:44,3
Wow, how do we simulate the
power of a grizzly?


116
0:4:44,3 --> 0:4:45,35
OK, let's break this down.


117
0:4:45,35 --> 0:4:47,38
After two days' research, they
look at me, and they say, OK,


118
0:4:47,38 --> 0:4:49,5
here's what you've got to do.


119
0:4:49,5 --> 0:4:54,33
If you can handle that pickup
truck, dead impact, at 50


120
0:4:54,33 --> 0:4:55,64
kilometers an hour--


121
0:4:55,64 --> 0:4:57,45
got no problem with a bear.


122
0:4:57,45 --> 0:5:0,61
Well, they see that and
assume, what an idiot.


123
0:5:0,61 --> 0:5:4,74
Jumped in the suit-- no, buddy,
that's four years.


124
0:5:4,74 --> 0:5:8,7
That's five suits, starting at
3 kilometers an hour, pop.


125
0:5:8,7 --> 0:5:11,24
8 kilometers an hour, pop.


126
0:5:11,24 --> 0:5:12,93
15 kilometers an hour, pop.


127
0:5:12,93 --> 0:5:14,86
All the way up to 50
before I got there.


128
0:5:14,86 --> 0:5:15,99
Do you know why I never
broke a bone?


129
0:5:15,99 --> 0:5:18,21
Do you know why I've never
sustained so much as a


130
0:5:18,21 --> 0:5:19,41
concussion?


131
0:5:19,41 --> 0:5:21,63
Because I know what I'm doing.


132
0:5:21,63 --> 0:5:23,7
People, this isn't
a big reach.


133
0:5:23,7 --> 0:5:24,33
I don't want to get hurt.


134
0:5:24,33 --> 0:5:27,38
So you're talking three years
and another four suits later


135
0:5:27,38 --> 0:5:28,45
before we got to the M VI.


136
0:5:28,45 --> 0:5:29,95
And that's how it does it.


137
0:5:29,95 --> 0:7:29,95
