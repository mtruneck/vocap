###4 Seven decades ago, in March 1940, the author John Steinbeck and his friend, marine biologist
###13 Ed Ricketts, sailed down the coast of California and Mexico to the Sea of Cortez.
###23 "The abundance of life here gives one an exuberance," they wrote, "a feeling of fullness and richness."
###38 Their stated purpose was to document the creatures that inhabit shallow waters and tide pools
###44 on the margins of the Sea of Cortez.
###48 But it became much more.
###55 In these mysterious, phosphorescent waters they sought an understanding of mankind's
###61 relationship to the natural world, and a wellspring of hope for a world headed toward war.
###72 Looking beyond the events of the day, the two friends foresaw our rising impact on the
###78 oceans, and the devastating impact that over fishing would have on this rich sea.
###87 And yet, in their journey, they encountered a periodic cooling of the eastern Pacific
###92 Ocean known as La Ni–a that can still set off an explosion of life.
###100 Can the story of their journey inspire new efforts to preserve the Sea of Cortez?
###124 Down along the shores of western Mexico, the wind blows hot and dry.
###134 Beyond these barren landscapes, cold currents rush up from the deep, and the ocean literally
###145 boils with life.
###156 Following their journey down to the Sea of Cortez in March of 1940, John Steinbeck and
###163 Ed Ricketts searched for a way to describe what they saw.
###168 "Trying to remember this place," they wrote, "is like trying to re-create a dream. It is
###179 fierce and hostile and sullen. The stone mountains pile up to the sky and there is little fresh
###188 water. But we know we must go back if we live, and we don't know why."
###201 The Sea of Cortez is one of the most diverse marine ecosystems on the planet. It's shaped
###217 by the cool waters of the California Current flowing into the warm tropics, and by a complex
###228 undersea terrain that rises up along a chain of islands and seamounts.
###236 It was the shorelines, between the desert and the deep, that drew John Steinbeck, the
###242 author, and Ed Ricketts, a marine biologist and expert on coastal ecosystems.
###251 Ricketts' book, "Between Pacific Tides," is a classic study of the inter-tidal zones of
###260 the California coastline... and the myriad creatures that live in shallow pools, clinging
###269 to rocks to sift the rich nutrients carried in by the tides.
###277 Steinbeck and Ricketts sought to extend this work to the Sea of Cortez and to explore ideas
###283 at the core of their friendship.
###290 They shared a belief that man's fate, like that of the animals they saw, is linked to
###296 the health of the natural world.
###301 Ricketts is said to have inspired some of Steinbeck's most memorable characters, including
###307 Doc in Cannery Row, and the preacher Jim Casy in The Grapes of Wrath, published a year before
###314 their voyage.
###318 Set against the backdrop of drought and economic depression, the book describes the dustbowl
###324 conditions that gripped the American heartland in the 1930s.
###329 "Now the wind grew strong and hard and it worked at the rain crust in the corn fields.
###337 Little by little the sky was darkened by the mixing dust, and carried away. The wind grew
###343 stronger. The rain crust broke and the dust lifted up out of the fields and drove gray
###350 plumes into the air like sluggish smoke."
###352 In most years, southerly winds carry moisture into the midsection of the country from the
###361 Gulf of Mexico.
###363 In the 1930s, according to a recent NASA study, those winds were diverted by a build up of
###371 warm water in the Western Atlantic, and by a periodic cooling of the Eastern Pacific
###377 known as La Ni–a.
###380 This combination robbed the region of rain.
###386 By the time Steinbeck and Ricketts began their journey, the historic backdrop had shifted
###392 to war. Fighting had engulfed Europe and was spreading to the western Pacific.
###404 While the United States was still officially neutral, American companies had begun supplying
###411 arms to the allied effort.
###421 In early 1940, John Steinbeck used money he earned from "The Grapes of Wrath" to hire
###428 a sardine boat called the Western Flyer.
###435 From Monterrey, California, he, his wife Carol, Ed Ricketts and a four-man crew headed south,
###443 charting a course along the Mexican coastline.
###450 By all accounts, the journey was filled with adventure, camaraderie, and a sense of wonder
###458 at the diversity of living things they encountered.
###466 Over a six-week period, the two friends wrote journal entries, took notes on conversations,
###472 and catalogued specimens they collected on the way.
###477 They compiled these writings into a book: "Sea of Cortez, A Leisurely Journal of Travel
###486 and Research," later changed to "The Log From the Sea of Cortez." The work amounts to a
###499 search for a way to understand nature, and humanity at large, in a world steadily coming
###505 apart at the seams.
###517 The crew had little to go on in advance of the journey, for the sparsely populated coastlines
###523 of Baja California had not been studied or mapped in detail.
###528 "From the information available," the book says, "a few facts did emerge. The Sea of
###540 Cortez, or the Gulf of California, is a long, narrow, highly dangerous body of water. It
###547 is subject to sudden and vicious storms of great intensity."
###556 One book they had read contained accounts of "ships broken up and scattered, of wrecks
###563 and wayward currents; of 50 miles of sea more dreaded than any other."
###574 In fact, their route along the coastlines of Baja California was an obstacle course
###580 of islands and outcroppings.
###586 All along the way, erosion and bone rattling earthquakes have exposed layers of ancient
###592 bedrock and volcanic flows, offering a window into the events that long ago shaped the region.
###603 Beginning around 25 million years ago, a giant section of the Earth's crust, known as the
###609 Pacific Ocean plate, began sliding past and pulling away from North America.
###618 Deep underground, the friction of rock grinding against rock fueled the rise of mountains
###624 and volcanoes that now define these rugged coastlines.
###630 Meanwhile, along a fault line that reaches north through California, a gash nearly 10,000
###637 feet deep opened in the Earth, now known as the Gulf of California Rift zone.
###648 From the north, the Sea of Cortez is fed by melting snow that flows down from the Rocky
###654 Mountains and through the Grand Canyon, and from the south, by powerful tides that surge
###668 in from the Pacific.
###680 On their way down from Monterrey, the crew of the Western Flyer passed by a wide diversity
###686 of coastal habitats.
###690 Below the surface, are kelp beds common in northern waters, and coral reefs that recall
###702 the tropics.
###709 Vast sea grass meadows, and tangled mangrove swamps, and a network of tidepools and rocky
###726 shallows, teeming with life.
###732 In the sheer density of living things, they may well have witnessed the extraordinary
###736 flipside of the climatic conditions that created the Dustbowl.
###745 During the onset of La Ni–a, every three to six years, strong equatorial winds begin
###751 to blow off the coast of South America, pushing warm surface waters away, while drawing cold,
###759 nutrient-rich waters up from the deep.
###768 That can fuel an explosion of microscopic plankton, and in turn, a vast natural melting
###777 pot of marine life.
###783 The two friends interpreted what they saw using the emerging science of ecology. Ricketts
###790 had been exposed to it in his studies at the University of Chicago and Steinbeck at Stanford
###796 University's Hopkins Marine Lab.
###800 The idea is that an ecosystem is governed by complex inter-dependencies between species
###807 and their environments. Scientists have expanded this notion to include evolution, nutrient
###815 cycling, food webs, and more.
###819 A central idea that appealed to Steinbeck and Ricketts is that the sum of individual
###825 animals adds up to a greater whole.
###829 Take, for instance, a school of small fish under attack by a band of sailfish. For individuals
###840 to survive, they must literally come together as one.
###845 "Their functions in the school," they wrote, "are in some as yet unknown way as controlled
###852 as though the school were one unit. We cannot conceive of this intricacy until we are able
###858 to think of the school as an animal itself, reacting with all its cells to stimuli which
###865 perhaps might not influence one fish at all."
###877 Steinbeck and Rickett's stated mission was to explore how individuals function within
###882 a group, and how a school or a reef or a tide pool fits within the greater marine ecosystem.
###894 Rather than find species that were rare or undiscovered, they set out to document what
###902 was there, then to contemplate its connections to the wider world.
###910 While the purpose of the trip was to produce a scientific record, the book they wrote,
###918 according to the scholar Richard Astro, is a "celebration of this holistic vision, depicted
###925 in terms more mystical and intuitive than scientific."
###931 This vision came together in their description of a shore visit to Puerto Escondido, a cove
###937 that today hosts a small marina.
###942 There, some local residents invited them on a hunt for big-horn sheep.
###950 The hike took them along hillsides lined with plants adapted to long periods of dryness.
###960 While they never saw any wild sheep, the trek gave them a chance to look back down at the
###966 Sea and to reflect on the mountains and the world that envelop it.
###975 They marveled at tiny desert springs, isolated within the waterless landscape, that were
###982 somehow filled with life.
###986 Likewise, in the ocean, they noted the remarkable collaboration between invertebrates in the
###994 tasks of gathering food and moving around.
###1001 Mysteries like these, they believed, would yield only to the most expansive view of individual
###1008 organisms in relation to countless others, all nested within the folds of an ocean, a
###1019 desert, and a planet.
###1027 Many of the great thinkers, they remind us later in the book, "discovered and reaffirmed
###1032 with astonishment the knowledge that all things are one thing and that one thing is all things
###1039 - plankton, a shimmering phosphorescence on the sea and the spinning planets and an expanding
###1051 universe, all bound together by the elastic string of time."
###1056 "It is advisable," they wrote, "to look from the tide pool to the stars and then back to
###1072 the tide pool again."
###1078 Within this all-embracing view, they believed, humans are uniquely capable of understanding
###1084 the whole of nature and affecting it.
###1090 As isolated and pristine as the Sea of Cortez might have seemed in 1940, it was still subject
###1097 to the intrusions of the wider world.
###1103 The two friends reported shrimp boats, for example, dredging up the sea bottom, "rapidly
###1109 destroying the species so that it may never come back, and with the species destroying
###1115 the ecological balance of the whole region. That isn't very important in the world. And
###1123 thousands of miles away the great bombs are falling and the stars are not moved thereby."
###1129 "None of it is important," they wrote, "or all of it is."
###1140 The book they wrote was published over a year after their journey ended, on December 5th
###1147 1941. Two days later, on December 7th, Japanese bombers descended on Pearl Harbor.
###1156 The book was lost in the news of the day, in a nation and a world moving rapidly toward
###1163 World War.
###1167 John Steinbeck went on to serve as a war correspondent, then returned to his literary career.
###1175 Ed Ricketts too served in the war as a medical lab technician for the Army.
###1181 He then returned to doing science, with groundbreaking studies on the sardine fishery in Monterrey
###1187 Bay that linked fishing practices to declining harvests.
###1192 In 1948, the two friends were planning another trip -- to study marine life in the Pacific
###1201 Northwest. Tragically, Ed Ricketts was killed when his car was hit by a passenger train.
###1220 The book he authored with John Steinbeck would echo down the years as commentary on the events
###1226 that had shaken the world, and on the world that would emerge in the aftermath.
###1234 Many of Baja California's landscapes and coastlines are still the way they were before humans
###1240 settled there.
###1243 But its waters have become the center of a thriving tourist and sport fishing industry,
###1250 and a magnet for large-scale commercial fishing.
###1256 Scientists at Scripps Institution of Oceanography recently conducted a comprehensive survey
###1261 of wildlife in the Sea of Cortez. Comparing what they saw against past surveys, they identified
###1271 a series of mounting threats.
###1277 Unsustainable water use practices in the Colorado River basin have damaged many of the estuaries
###1283 at its mouth, threatening shrimp and other fisheries.
###1290 Industrial fishing methods have wreaked havoc on a variety of fish populations.
###1295 An example is the deployment of gillnets, curtains that stretch across miles of ocean
###1303 and trap whatever happens to come by.
###1312 Another is long-line fishing, in which fishermen deploy hundreds of baited hooks from lines
###1318 of buoys.
###1326 These methods have all but eliminated oceanic predators such as sharks and tuna.
###1334 They've decimated some non-target species such as manta rays.
###1345 With many of the traditional fisheries depleted, the report warns of a practice known as "fishing
###1352 down the food web." Teams of divers pick through the reefs for invertebrates, or lone fish
###1361 hiding among the rocks at night. They take anything they can get.
###1375 On their visit to the rocky southern tip of Baja California, Cabo San Lucas, John Steinbeck
###1382 and Ed Ricketts reveled in the diversity of living things: "the incredible beauty of the
###1390 tide pools," "the brilliant colors," "the swarming species."
###1402 Those same tide pools today are covered over with sand trucked in for the construction
###1407 of condos and vacation resorts.
###1411 Cabo San Lucas has become a major tourist destination, with accommodations for over
###1420 a million visitors per year in resorts and hotel chains.
###1427 The human presence has introduced a major new dynamic to the Sea of Cortez that can
###1433 be difficult to unravel.
###1438 Since the year 2002, the entire eastern pacific coast, up to Alaska and including the Sea
###1444 of Cortez, has experienced the rapid spread of Humboldt squid. Moving up from the deep
###1454 in large numbers, these ferocious hunters go after a wide variety of prey.
###1465 Their overall impact on the food web is largely unknown. In the Sea of Cortez, they are targets
###1477 for fishermen who ride out at night, often hauling in tons of squid per trip to bring
###1482 to market.
###1485 A recent study blames the spread of these squid on a combination of factors, from warming
###1493 ocean temperatures, to reduced competition for food, and the decline of predatory species
###1499 like sharks.
###1502 The disappearance of sharks is in stark evidence at a seamount near the Bay of La Paz.
###1512 Known as El Bajo, it was once a top destination for divers hoping to observe the gathering
###1518 of hammerhead sharks.
###1520 This seamount still attracts a rich array of sea life.
###1528 Today, the big hammerhead schools are a rare sight.
###1533 That's because few things have changed in the Sea of Cortez as dramatically as the value
###1539 of its sharks.
###1546 It has exploded in recent years, mainly to supply the Asian market for shark fin soup.
###1555 Traditionally served at weddings in China, it can fetch up to $100 per bowl.
###1562 About half the world trade in shark fins goes through the port of Hong Kong, a trade estimated
###1569 at 38 million sharks annually, that may well be much higher.
###1579 The oceans today are literally being swept of sharks.
###1591 Because they congregate in large numbers, hammerheads are especially vulnerable.
###1598 There's money to be made in a big haul, such as this one filmed in the Sea of Cortez in
###1603 the year 2000.
###1606 A fishing boat had encircled a school at a seamount. With nets designed to haul in large
###1613 numbers of tuna, it scooped up dozens of hammerhead sharks.
###1620 Whether for subsistence or industrial-scale business, fishing is an opportunistic pursuit.
###1632 Fishermen take what's there or what they are able to bring to shore.
###1641 Overfishing in the Sea of Cortez is part of a larger global problem. According to UN estimates,
###1650 80% of oceanic fish stocks around the world are now considered fully or over-exploited.
###1663 John Steinbeck and Ed Ricketts had sought hope, amid a rising tide of war, by crafting
###1669 a holistic view of man and nature. In doing so, they helped supply the philosophical underpinnings
###1678 of a broad movement to protect Earth's natural environments.
###1684 That movement is beginning to take hold in the Sea of Cortez, offering glimmers of hope.
###1691 There are new regulations, for example, governing drift-net and long-line fishing. Some critics
###1700 say they don't go far enough. Others say they are at least a start.
###1710 If nothing else, in the Sea of Cortez today, more divers, sport fishermen, and boaters
###1716 are out keeping a watch on things. With the aid of a Mexican navy diver, this group has
###1725 come out to remove a drift net, one step in restoring a reef to its natural state.
###1737 Some places like this are now part of a growing network of preserves and protected areas,
###1744 a hedge against the rising impact of development.
###1750 Sailing along the southern tip of Baja, Steinbeck and Ricketts were struck by the natural desolation
###1756 of the shorelines, "dry with strange flat mountains and rocks torn by dryness, and the
###1764 heat shimmer hung over the land even in March."
###1769 Here, they visited a reef called Cabo Pulmo, where swift ocean currents bring in a torrent
###1777 of sea life.
###1783 In the 1990s, these reefs were considered overfished and damaged by pollution. Biologists
###1791 and local fishermen came together to fight for and win protected status for Cabo Pulmo.
###1799 Today, no fishing is allowed.
###1808 The reefs of Cabo Pulmo have since become a Mecca for divers and a source of large,
###1816 mature fish for local fishermen outside the reserve.
###1822 In their visit to Cabo Pulmo, the scientists at Scripps Institution of Oceanography found
###1829 that the sheer weight, or biomass, of fish here is at least four times that of similar
###1835 unprotected reefs. That includes species up and down the food chain, from plankton feeders
###1846 to predators, bottom dwellers to ocean fliers.
###1853 Moving north and into the Sea of Cortez, the crew of the Western Flyer passed by a chain
###1858 of volcanic islands, the largest of which is called Espiritu Santo.
###1867 In the year 1535, the Spanish Explorer, Hernan Cortes, named it Isla de las Perlas, Island
###1876 of the Pearls, after rich pearl oyster beds on its western side.
###1885 On the northern end of this chain, a tiny marine reserve runs down the steep sides of
###1890 a group of small islands called Los Islotes.
###1900 The islands deflect deep currents that flow into the Gulf, sending them to the surface.
###1913 These nutrient-laden waters fuel an explosion of microscopic plants and animals.
###1920 They in turn draw vast walls of anchovies, sardines, and other baitfish.
###1929 Moving with currents that swirl around it, these schools wrap the island in a ribbon
###1934 of silver.
###1940 Large numbers of bait fish help support a community of predators.
###1949 Reserves like this protect wild creatures from overfishing, but not from a larger cycle
###1955 of awakening and dying that defines the Sea of Cortez.
###1963 John Steinbeck and Ed Ricketts sailed into the cool, rich waters of La Ni–a.
###1970 Inevitably, they give way to the warm waters of El Ni–o.
###1979 This climatic shift brings rain to the Baja Peninsula, along with glimmers of green.
###1992 Washing down hillsides and gullies, the rains deliver a flood of nutrients to shallow lagoons
###1998 and mangrove swamps.
###2001 Within the protective shelter of mangrove roots, young yellow snappers and other fish
###2007 can now grow and mature.
###2010 Out at sea, El Ni–o is a time of scarcity. The influx of warm water stifles the upwelling
###2021 of nutrients. The Sea of Cortez can then grow fallow, turning clear and lifeless.
###2031 That can wreak havoc on some critical habitats, including dense forests of sargassum, or brown
###2038 algae, that grow along the shorelines.
###2043 A wide variety of fish use them as a refuge in their early stages of development. Then,
###2052 when wind and waves pull patches of sargassum from the shore, these fish hitch a ride out
###2058 to their ocean habitats.
###2062 As sargassum dwindles during El Ni–o, so do a range of fish populations.
###2072 Many ocean creatures are known to travel widely in pursuit of food supplies that shift with
###2078 the seasons or with the climate.
###2088 Pacific white-sided dolphins, traveling in groups up to 100 or more range from the tip
###2095 of Baja California in the South to the Bering Sea near the Arctic in the north .
###2105 One study showed that with the onset of warm El Ni–o waters, these highly mobile predators
###2112 adapted by migrating out to cooler seas and by changing their diet.
###2134 Another ocean predator, the Magnificent Frigate bird, has a strategy that allows it to stay
###2140 put in times of scarcity.
###2147 Gathering in colonies atop mangrove forests, it has the longest nesting cycle of any bird.
###2154 A frigate male attracts a mate by inflating a huge red sack on its chest. Once a pair
###2165 is made, the couple puts its all into raising a single chick, incubating, then feeding it
###2172 for about a year and even longer in lean El Ni–o years.
###2183 The colony is a busy place as couples take turns flying out over the ocean in search
###2190 of food.
###2195 Because frigates lack the oils in their feathers that would allow them to land on the water,
###2200 they stay in flight for days or weeks at a time, riding wind currents to conserve energy.
###2209 Frigates are known to snag flying fish out of the air, or to steal fish caught by other
###2217 birds.
###2222 Soaring high above the ocean, they watch for signs of activity on the surface. If predators
###2232 force small fish to the surface, frigates can swoop down to skillfully pluck them out.
###2239 In time, as the warm waters of El Ni–o fade, the productivity of the Sea of Cortez begins
###2249 to rise again.
###2259 With the return of La Ni–a, the wind blows again across the barren shorelines.
###2266 Cold water rises up from the deep, laden with nutrients, and the sea grows cloudy with plankton.
###2281 Life returns with a flourish.
###2287 John Steinbeck and Ed Ricketts celebrated the rush of living organisms.
###2293 "The sea here swarms with life," they wrote.
###2299 "We could see the splashing of great schools of tuna in the distance where they beat the
###2304 water to spray in their millions."
###2310 They also noted great schools of giant manta rays. One crew member tried repeatedly, but
###2317 without success, to haul one onto the boat.
###2327 While mantas are scarce in the Sea of Cortez today, their smaller cousins, the mobulas,
###2333 are not.
###2339 Hundreds swim together in glorious flying formation, at times rising to the surface
###2346 to feed on a dense layer of plankton.
###2356 The recent period of La Ni–a shows how productive the Sea of Cortez can be and offers a glimpse
###2365 of what's at stake in efforts to preserve it for the future.
###2376 The abundance of food at the surface has also drawn the largest fish in the ocean, the whale
###2382 shark.
###2384 Moving slowly along, they take in big gulps of water, then filter out zooplankton, krill,
###2395 larvae, and even small fish.
###2398 At up to 30 tons and 20 meters in length, adult whale sharks have few natural predators.
###2409 They can live up to 70 years, churning along in plankton-rich seas.
###2417 With plankton filling the water column, the drama of life and death in the Sea of Cortez
###2423 reaches a fever pitch.
###2428 Predators and prey come together amid the tangled ruins of a sunken ship.
###2440 Out along the Pacific coastline of Baja, the cool water of La Ni–a has spurred a rarely
###2452 seen migration of countless young mola molas. These so-called ocean sunfish can grow to
###2462 three meters long and weigh several tons.
###2468 Along the way, parasites hitch a ride.
###2474 When that happens, fish swims up along side bird hoping there's a mutual advantage.
###2495 Just on shore, the season has brought a bumper crop of young sea lions. They are born with
###2502 their eyes open and are able to swim soon after.
###2508 While pups may nurse on shore for up to a year, they begin to eat fish within a few
###2517 months.
###2523 Along the Pacific coast, just beyond the Sea of Cortez, the young ones hang out within
###2528 the protective shelter of the rocky shoreline. Here, they learn to interact with other sea
###2538 lions, to vocalize, to swim, and hunt.
###2549 Being a young sea lion is all about riding the currents and waves and investigating the
###2559 myriad creatures that live in shallow water.
###2566 This one finds itself in a game of hide and seek with a giant damsel fish. The fish is
###2575 most likely just defending its territory.
###2581 At every turn fish out-maneuvers mammal. But the sea lion is becoming more and more determined.
###2600 In the end, there's only so much frustration a sea lion will endure.
###2610 If you can't eat the fish, you can always eat sand. It could be to gain extra ballast
###2618 for deep dives or to help with digestion. No one really knows.
###2628 When the urge to scratch strikes, a rock with barnacles is always within reach.
###2657 As these young sea lions grow, so do their appetites. As adults, sea lions move out into
###2668 the ocean to forage, sometimes traveling hundreds of miles.
###2674 To observe their full potential as hunters, you have to follow them out to sea. Near a
###2688 seamount, a group of sea lions encounters a school of small fish. The fish instinctively
###2696 pull together, forming a bait ball.
###2705 Out here, in the blue water, schools of fish are targets for predators endowed with blazing
###2711 speed and lightning reflexes. Striped marlin join the attack from below, pinning the school
###2722 on the surface.
###2727 With their ability to quickly accelerate, and swim in tight circles, striped marlin
###2732 are the dive-bombers of the sea.
###2738 The bait ball avoids the agile predators by turning, dodging, dispersing and coming back
###2755 together.
###2757 The predators begin to outlast the prey and pick them off one by one.
###2770 Divers report seeing marlin use their bills to stun their prey, then circle back around
###2776 to pick up their prize.
###2780 In a survey of fish found in the stomachs of Marlin caught by fishermen, over half bore
###2785 deep marks or cuts.
###2794 Another predator now joins the hunt. A Brydes whale roars in from out of the blue.
###2814 In the Sea of Cortez, the strongest reason for hope may well lie in the hidden treasures
###2819 of the sea itself.
###2823 In tandem with the shifting climate, the ocean releases its stores of wealth from places
###2830 unknown to people yet well known to creatures that ply its depths.
###2840 Down along a seamount near the mouth of the Sea of Cortez is a sight that many hope will
###2845 one day become commonplace again.
###2855 Vague shapes appear in the gray and murky deep. Perhaps in response to a change in temperature,
###2862 or to an ocean flooded with nutrients, a school of hammerhead sharks suddenly arrives.
###2885 To these sharks, equipped to read the magnetic contours of the sea floor, islands and seamounts
###2891 may serve as landmarks, or gathering spots, for mating and feeding.
###2914 John Steinbeck often portrayed his characters at the lowest points of their lives, struggling
###2920 to gain a fresh start against larger forces at work in the world.
###2927 That may well be the case for these sharks and for the phosphorescent waters of the Sea
###2932 of Cortez. John Steinbeck and Ed Ricketts believed that humanity, with its unique ability
###2943 to see the whole, would find a way to preserve natural scenes like this.
###2950 "In spite of overwhelming evidence to the contrary," they wrote, "the trait of hope
###2959 still controls the future, and man, not a species but a triumphant race, will approach
###2968 perfection, and tearing himself free, will march up the stars and take his place where,
###2976 because of his power and virtue, he belongs."
###2983 The two friends knew that even their own footprint would change the Sea of Cortez in small ways,
###2991 as they entered its tide pools to collect specimens, sailed through its channels, or
###3000 docked on its shores.
###3004 In the years since, mankind's impact on this already dynamic ecosystem has steadily grown.
###3013 And yet more and more of us are coming here, not to harvest its treasures, but to experience
###3020 the sense of discovery, the mystical connection to the ocean and the earth that the two friends
