1
0:0:0,604 --> 0:0:4,811
- Modest preemptive actions
can obviate the need


2
0:0:4,811 --> 0:0:8,301
of more drastic actions
at a later date.


3
0:0:8,301 --> 0:0:11,994
- You think that you've been taught
things like confidence intervals


4
0:0:11,994 --> 0:0:15,25
in an elementary statistical course
that would let you do this;


5
0:0:15,25 --> 0:0:17,523
but if you really
studied carefully,


6
0:0:17,523 --> 0:0:19,782
you'd know that they
don't let you do this.


7
0:0:19,782 --> 0:0:23,692
A really principled frequentist can't
produce a probability distribution...


8
0:0:23,692 --> 0:0:26,798
- The conclusion we want to point out
when we think about valuation


9
0:0:26,798 --> 0:0:30,624
is the fact that means are scarce.
I alluded to this already that


10
0:0:30,624 --> 0:0:33,943
as finite beings we can't will
our ends to be attained.


11
0:0:33,943 --> 0:0:38,944
- A statistical description of the
government's net-of-interest surplus.


12
0:0:38,944 --> 0:0:43,713
- ...deflation, I think that yields
could drop to say, less than 1%


13
0:0:43,713 --> 0:0:47,242
on the 10 years and less
than 2% on the 30 years...


14
0:0:47,242 --> 0:0:50,874
- ...that would effectively be a takeover of
monetary policy by the Congress.
- Oh, hello!


15
0:0:50,874 --> 0:0:54,612
Daunting, right?
Might even make you feel stupid.


16
0:0:54,612 --> 0:0:56,744
Perhaps it's no wonder then,


17
0:0:56,744 --> 0:0:59,925
while even with the ongoing
economic failures across the world:


18
0:0:59,925 --> 0:1:3,122
inequality, increasing
poverty, debt collapse,


19
0:1:3,122 --> 0:1:5,673
bank failures,
unemployment rising,


20
0:1:5,673 --> 0:1:8,674
very few today seem to
be able to understand,


21
0:1:8,674 --> 0:1:11,296
let alone discuss,
modern economics,


22
0:1:11,296 --> 0:1:13,396
outside, of course,
the delegation game


23
0:1:13,396 --> 0:1:15,727
where the only attempted
solutions people know


24
0:1:15,727 --> 0:1:19,651
is the mere shifting around of
the deck chairs on the Titanic,


25
0:1:19,651 --> 0:1:24,462
assuming some new politician, central
bank policy, or corporate legislation


26
0:1:24,462 --> 0:1:26,682
is going to save the day.


27
0:1:26,682 --> 0:1:31,264
Some years back, after coming to the
conclusion that our politicians,


28
0:1:31,264 --> 0:1:36,747
legislators, and established authorities
just might be provably incompetent


29
0:1:36,747 --> 0:1:40,989
when it comes to the truly intelligent
management of our society,


30
0:1:40,989 --> 0:1:45,179
I started to look for questions
and answers on my own,


31
0:1:45,179 --> 0:1:48,75
asking those questions about things


32
0:1:48,75 --> 0:1:51,894
that many today either seem to take
for granted, ignore or even worse,


33
0:1:51,894 --> 0:1:55,72
assume that they have no capacity
or business investigating at all,


34
0:1:55,72 --> 0:1:58,3
since our credentialed
authorities in control


35
0:1:58,3 --> 0:2:1,212
must be smarter, more informed.


36
0:2:1,212 --> 0:2:3,761
It's a sad staple of
modern culture, you know,


37
0:2:3,761 --> 0:2:7,58
the old "Relax, turn on the
TV, keep going into debt,


38
0:2:7,58 --> 0:2:9,575
and pump out a bunch of
kids while you're at it,"


39
0:2:9,575 --> 0:2:12,86
but most importantly,
keep showing up at those jobs


40
0:2:12,86 --> 0:2:15,757
which you have likely already
fooled yourself into believing


41
0:2:15,757 --> 0:2:18,346
serve some legitimate social role.


42
0:2:18,346 --> 0:2:22,284
Remember, the 1% of the world
that owns 40% of the planet's wealth


43
0:2:22,284 --> 0:2:27,85
did not get that way with you
understanding how the world really works.


44
0:2:27,85 --> 0:2:30,884
Nevertheless, and such
cynicism aside (I'm sorry),


45
0:2:30,884 --> 0:2:33,364
I decided that I
needed to start again,


46
0:2:33,364 --> 0:2:35,816
if you will, and ask some
fundamental questions


47
0:2:35,816 --> 0:2:38,89
about stuff most have simply
written off and forgotten.


48
0:2:38,89 --> 0:2:42,599
If you were to take a poll today of
our species, asking what truly are


49
0:2:42,599 --> 0:2:46,91
the most fundamental questions that
pertain to human survival and prosperity,


50
0:2:46,91 --> 0:2:51,145
such as, I don't know, what really
supports human life, how food grows,


51
0:2:51,145 --> 0:2:55,459
what energy is, what creates and
reinforces good public health,


52
0:2:55,459 --> 0:3:0,544
what defines a useful or
detrimental belief system,


53
0:3:0,544 --> 0:3:4,988
you can rest assured, that the vast
majority would have more concrete answers


54
0:3:4,988 --> 0:3:12,911
about baseball statistics, fashion trends,
sitcom plots, and religious scriptures.


55
0:3:12,911 --> 0:3:16,544
Not to demean the cultural pleasures
and creativity of expression


56
0:3:16,544 --> 0:3:18,702
that creates enjoyment in this life,


57
0:3:18,702 --> 0:3:22,883
but we have a distortion of priority
that has proven incredibly detrimental


58
0:3:22,883 --> 0:3:25,751
to the future of our sustainability
on this planet,


59
0:3:25,751 --> 0:3:28,737
where the majority facing
clear mounting problems


60
0:3:28,737 --> 0:3:33,0
not only doesn't understand what the
root of such problems really are,


61
0:3:33,0 --> 0:3:36,942
they don't even know
what questions to ask;


62
0:3:36,942 --> 0:3:40,616
and today, there is no greater
destructive ignorance at hand,


63
0:3:40,616 --> 0:3:45,534
than the vastly delusional concept
known as modern economics.


64
0:3:45,534 --> 0:3:51,221
It is in this fundamental context
that I found the most interest.


65
0:3:51,221 --> 0:3:53,476
What is an economy?


66
0:3:53,476 --> 0:3:56,61
Where does its foundational
premise come from?


67
0:3:56,61 --> 0:4:0,55
What are we relating to exactly?


68
0:4:0,55 --> 0:4:4,832
How is societal organization
finding a benchmark for itself?


69
0:4:4,832 --> 0:4:7,421
Is there a benchmark?
What are we doing?


70
0:4:7,421 --> 0:4:10,829
Why does the discussion of this
subject appear to be so elitist


71
0:4:10,829 --> 0:4:16,157
in its vocabulary and orientation?
Is it really that complicated?


72
0:4:16,157 --> 0:4:19,81
I became so tired of being
called ignorant of the subject


73
0:4:19,81 --> 0:4:22,89
by self-proclaimed
experts I've challenged,


74
0:4:22,89 --> 0:4:25,88
I decided to take it upon
myself to read the entire


75
0:4:25,88 --> 0:4:29,94
macro-economics curriculum
of Harvard University


76
0:4:29,94 --> 0:4:31,564
from the undergraduate
to the PhD level,


77
0:4:31,564 --> 0:4:35,687
along with all the staples of influence:
F.A. Hayek, John Maynard Keynes,


78
0:4:35,687 --> 0:4:39,772
Ludwig von Mises; and I'll tell
you what, I'm really glad I did


79
0:4:39,772 --> 0:4:43,868
because I had some very poor
judgments that needed correction,


80
0:4:43,868 --> 0:4:47,519
not so much regarding my
views about economics,


81
0:4:47,519 --> 0:4:50,684
but that life is short,
and I wasted an enormous,


82
0:4:50,684 --> 0:4:54,185
unforgivable amount of time
reading this outdated,


83
0:4:54,185 --> 0:4:56,712
overly-intellectualized gibberish.


84
0:4:56,712 --> 0:4:59,442
[Glass Breaking] Ah, shit!


85
0:4:59,442 --> 0:5:3,31
Bob, would you take care of that please?
The fuse panel.


86
0:5:3,31 --> 0:5:7,755
Be careful man, it's not...
[Explosion][Bob screaming]


87
0:5:7,755 --> 0:5:10,174
As the following
episode will detail,


88
0:5:10,174 --> 0:5:13,318
modern economics is not
true economics at all.


89
0:5:13,318 --> 0:5:18,462
It's a mere ideological philosophy,
built upon a series of presuppositions


90
0:5:18,462 --> 0:5:21,733
that have been given the
illusion of permanence.


91
0:5:21,733 --> 0:5:25,699
There is absolutely no relationship
to the scientific integrity


92
0:5:25,699 --> 0:5:28,773
of our knowledge of the environment
built into this model.


93
0:5:28,773 --> 0:5:31,574
The monetary-market system
of religious belief


94
0:5:31,574 --> 0:5:35,367
is at the core of the vast majority
of ecological and social imbalance


95
0:5:35,367 --> 0:5:37,366
we see in the world today.


96
0:5:37,366 --> 0:5:43,9
Sadly, it is in the face of
normality, so many look past it.


97
0:5:43,9 --> 0:5:46,305
We might begin to see that this
principal notion and practice


98
0:5:46,305 --> 0:5:49,253
is truly a problem in
society, and to me,


99
0:5:49,253 --> 0:6:22,734
it is at the heart of
a culture in decline.


100
0:6:22,734 --> 0:6:26,863
Earth: Curious little ball of
rock, gas and water, isn't it?


101
0:6:26,863 --> 0:6:30,586
Hard to believe this little bubble of
chemical elements floating in space,


102
0:6:30,586 --> 0:6:34,189
basically powered by the sun,
could give rise to our colorful,


103
0:6:34,189 --> 0:6:37,73
yet rather troubling
super-monkey species,


104
0:6:37,73 --> 0:6:42,867
a species often appearing pretty serious
in its interest to destroy its habitat,


105
0:6:42,867 --> 0:6:47,118
though I should say pretty serious
in its interest to destroy itself.


106
0:6:47,118 --> 0:6:50,49
- What is democracy?


107
0:6:50,49 --> 0:6:56,397
- It's got something to do with young
men killing each other, I believe.


108
0:6:56,397 --> 0:6:59,205
- Excuse me a second.
Bob, what the hell was that?


109
0:6:59,205 --> 0:7:3,14
The cut away, it wasn't funny.
It was just depressing.


110
0:7:3,14 --> 0:7:9,589
Couldn't you find some guy shooting a
bottle rocket out of his ass or something?


111
0:7:9,589 --> 0:7:13,392
You know what our demographic is
and the point of the show, right?


112
0:7:13,392 --> 0:7:15,877
Okay, well please.


113
0:7:15,877 --> 0:7:19,62
Anyway, perhaps our
immaturity is just a phase,


114
0:7:19,62 --> 0:7:21,643
a tragically comedic rite of passage,


115
0:7:21,643 --> 0:7:24,123
no different than children
that need to be burned


116
0:7:24,123 --> 0:7:27,196
by a hot stove in order to
realize they shouldn't touch it,


117
0:7:27,196 --> 0:7:29,531
or what the physics
behind it may be.


118
0:7:29,531 --> 0:7:32,473
Nevertheless, the history and
characteristics of this little orb


119
0:7:32,473 --> 0:7:35,843
can be scientifically described
with a good deal of accuracy:


120
0:7:35,843 --> 0:7:38,965
A couple of billion years old now,
a composite of gas and dust


121
0:7:38,965 --> 0:7:42,441
that resulted mostly from
a large chemical reaction long ago,


122
0:7:42,441 --> 0:7:45,599
likely an exploding
star or supernova;


123
0:7:45,599 --> 0:7:50,68
and over millions of years this dust clustered
into relatively big chunks of rock,


124
0:7:50,68 --> 0:7:52,658
a pronounced gravitational
field emerged,


125
0:7:52,658 --> 0:7:55,602
our chemical elements
were slowly reorganized,


126
0:7:55,602 --> 0:7:59,488
and conditions emerged to
enable water and an atmosphere,


127
0:7:59,488 --> 0:8:3,611
which is what bred the first
single-celled organisms;


128
0:8:3,611 --> 0:8:6,384
and so went the slow
process of mutation


129
0:8:6,384 --> 0:8:11,488
into the very amusing
circumstance we have today: us.


130
0:8:11,488 --> 0:8:14,735
Of course, you are free to believe
whatever creation story you like:


131
0:8:14,735 --> 0:8:19,218
a rib from Adam, alien cross
pollination, primordial ooze.


132
0:8:19,218 --> 0:8:22,555
At the end of the day, the utility
of such knowledge is quite small.


133
0:8:22,555 --> 0:8:25,44
In fact, our little
monkey brains


134
0:8:25,44 --> 0:8:28,587
might never have a complete
picture of something so complex.


135
0:8:28,587 --> 0:8:32,259
Yet what we do know is that the
universe is governed by laws,


136
0:8:32,259 --> 0:8:35,877
not moral or religious laws,
but laws that were around


137
0:8:35,877 --> 0:8:39,743
long before we ever evolved
a brain to understand them.


138
0:8:39,743 --> 0:8:43,18
Laws that very clearly point out
that we either adapt to them


139
0:8:43,18 --> 0:8:46,548
and respect them, or we
suffer the consequences.


140
0:8:46,548 --> 0:8:52,19
Such is the true face of God:
the Laws of Nature.


141
0:8:52,19 --> 0:8:54,557
In many ways, the
history of our universe


142
0:8:54,557 --> 0:8:57,34
is the history of our
understanding of it,


143
0:8:57,34 --> 0:8:59,388
and we have come a
long way as a species


144
0:8:59,388 --> 0:9:3,164
with respect to how we organize
our lives around these rules.


145
0:9:3,164 --> 0:9:5,779
Likely the best example
of this adaptation,


146
0:9:5,779 --> 0:9:9,479
or in many ways lack thereof,
is how we think about economy,


147
0:9:9,479 --> 0:9:12,264
the foundation of our social survival.


148
0:9:12,264 --> 0:9:15,721
Many thousands of years ago,
our super-monkey brethren


149
0:9:15,721 --> 0:9:18,43
began to discover how to engage nature.


150
0:9:18,43 --> 0:9:21,499
We went from being completely
at the mercy of the habitat,


151
0:9:21,499 --> 0:9:23,704
gathering our food
with some hunting,


152
0:9:23,704 --> 0:9:27,63
living and migrating around the
natural seasonal regeneration,


153
0:9:27,63 --> 0:9:31,601
to an agricultural revolution,
learning how to cultivate food,


154
0:9:31,601 --> 0:9:34,638
create ever [more] sophisticated
tools to ease labor


155
0:9:34,638 --> 0:9:38,302
and in effect, learn how
to mimic nature itself.


156
0:9:38,302 --> 0:9:42,124
In fact, this new awareness and
ever-increasing understanding


157
0:9:42,124 --> 0:9:45,126
to harness the processes
of nature to our advantage


158
0:9:45,126 --> 0:9:49,7
is what has led to the vast
technological innovation we see today.


159
0:9:49,7 --> 0:9:52,748
If nature is doing something,
odds are we can understand how


160
0:9:52,748 --> 0:9:57,53
through these dynamic scientific principles,
from artificial intelligence today


161
0:9:57,53 --> 0:10:0,252
which works to emulate actual
neurological processes,


162
0:10:0,252 --> 0:10:3,291
to molecular engineering
which uses the atomic logic


163
0:10:3,291 --> 0:10:5,909
to manually recreate material objects.


164
0:10:5,909 --> 0:10:10,615
And now, ever-important blood
shifting erectile dysfunction drugs,


165
0:10:10,615 --> 0:10:13,51
which if you have being
watching TV recently,


166
0:10:13,51 --> 0:10:17,5
must be the most epidemic health
crisis in the Western world today.


167
0:10:17,5 --> 0:10:20,744
Since this revolution, human
society became less nomadic,


168
0:10:20,744 --> 0:10:22,821
slowly merging into cities,


169
0:10:22,821 --> 0:10:26,23
and systems of labor
specialization began to rise


170
0:10:26,23 --> 0:10:30,54
along with means for exchange.
Barter is a common example.


171
0:10:30,54 --> 0:10:33,413
You need some eggs?
Maybe give some firewood you chopped up


172
0:10:33,413 --> 0:10:35,759
in exchange for the
dairy farmer's work.


173
0:10:35,759 --> 0:10:40,331
Yet, such practices became cumbersome
and impractical after a while;


174
0:10:40,331 --> 0:10:43,411
so the idea of using
some rare fancy rocks,


175
0:10:43,411 --> 0:10:47,893
like gold and silver as a medium of
exchange, eased these transactions


176
0:10:47,893 --> 0:10:51,98
through a system of pricing goods
in terms of their relative value.


177
0:10:51,98 --> 0:10:56,416
This gave birth to what we know today
as the adjustable price system


178
0:10:56,416 --> 0:11:0,215
which, through the public's aggregate
patterns of exchange and production,


179
0:11:0,215 --> 0:11:2,784
creates a crude, yet
semi-workable logic


180
0:11:2,784 --> 0:11:6,389
where the prices of goods reflect
the balance of supply and demand,


181
0:11:6,389 --> 0:11:14,0
otherwise known as the market or market value.
Let me explain.


182
0:11:14,0 --> 0:11:17,594
When you stumble into the mall
and buy the 85th generation


183
0:11:17,594 --> 0:11:22,76
iPoop 4G mp3 colostomy-bag
camera phone waffle maker,


184
0:11:22,76 --> 0:11:27,578
you are creating economic signal information
that is used to calculate demand,


185
0:11:27,578 --> 0:11:30,834
local and regional preferences,
and other resulting data


186
0:11:30,834 --> 0:11:34,9
in concert with the millions
of other impulsive consumers


187
0:11:34,9 --> 0:11:37,385
who, having also likely
bought the 84th generation


188
0:11:37,385 --> 0:11:40,211
just two months prior
for twice the price,


189
0:11:40,211 --> 0:11:43,506
creates an aggregate flow
of input data and feedback


190
0:11:43,506 --> 0:11:48,3
that allows for an ostensibly rational
regulation of resource allocation,


191
0:11:48,3 --> 0:11:51,789
production, distribution, labor
requirements, and of course


192
0:11:51,789 --> 0:11:56,19
price consensus in the market based
on perceived supply and demand,


193
0:11:56,19 --> 0:11:59,26
not to mention the general
data of how the marketing team


194
0:11:59,26 --> 0:12:1,635
can screw you over
even more later on.


195
0:12:1,635 --> 0:12:4,978
This mechanism is partly
what the ultimate high priest


196
0:12:4,978 --> 0:12:9,597
of our current economic religion,
Adam Smith, was alluding to


197
0:12:9,597 --> 0:12:14,139
with his 'invisible hand' notion
of causality in the free market.


198
0:12:14,139 --> 0:12:16,279
And in many ways he
was on to something.


199
0:12:16,279 --> 0:12:19,738
It does work in a limited
context and a crude way.


200
0:12:19,738 --> 0:12:24,498
In fact, in the 1920's an economist
named Ludwig von Mises put forward


201
0:12:24,498 --> 0:12:28,341
the still high-standing claim
that without the price mechanism


202
0:12:28,341 --> 0:12:31,975
economic calculation and
rational resource allocation


203
0:12:31,975 --> 0:12:35,549
and general organization
would be impossible.


204
0:12:35,549 --> 0:12:38,998
He called it 'The Economic
Calculation Problem'.


205
0:12:38,998 --> 0:12:41,872
However things are much different
today than they were 200 years ago


206
0:12:41,872 --> 0:12:44,39
when Adam Smith published
his 'Wealth of Nations'


207
0:12:44,39 --> 0:12:47,454
or when Ludwig von Mises made his
criticism of central planning.


208
0:12:47,454 --> 0:12:51,176
The fact is the argument has changed.
The economic debate now is


209
0:12:51,176 --> 0:12:54,731
what is actually sustainable and
progressive for the human species,


210
0:12:54,731 --> 0:12:57,606
not to mere mechanics of
the movement of the money.


211
0:12:57,606 --> 0:13:0,363
While it is true the
price system might allow


212
0:13:0,363 --> 0:13:3,235
for the basic calculation
of supply & demand data,


213
0:13:3,235 --> 0:13:7,95
to help rationally allocate labor,
preference, distribution and the like,


214
0:13:7,95 --> 0:13:10,503
it ignores the real
operational factors


215
0:13:10,503 --> 0:13:14,81
that relate to true,
efficient earthly management


216
0:13:14,81 --> 0:13:16,644
hence the true
definition of economy


217
0:13:16,644 --> 0:13:20,203
which is:
optimized efficiency on all levels.


218
0:13:20,203 --> 0:13:24,848
For instance, there is no consideration
for optimum resource allocation


219
0:13:24,848 --> 0:13:27,248
based on the material's
most efficient purpose.


220
0:13:27,248 --> 0:13:30,427
Rational allocation of
resources is not rational


221
0:13:30,427 --> 0:13:35,0
if the most conducive use of those
natural materials, scientifically,


222
0:13:35,0 --> 0:13:38,652
is not directly considered and
brought into comparison. [REJECTED]


223
0:13:38,652 --> 0:13:41,752
There is no consideration for
the organizational efficiency


224
0:13:41,752 --> 0:13:44,843
of technical production itself,
and all you have to do is


225
0:13:44,843 --> 0:13:50,444
analyze the waste machine of globalization
to see this insanity at work.


226
0:13:50,444 --> 0:13:54,593
There is also no consideration for
regeneration needs or recycling protocols:


227
0:13:54,593 --> 0:13:59,909
a true requirement for responsible
rational resource use on a finite planet,


228
0:13:59,909 --> 0:14:3,72
nor is there any true production
or distribution efficiency


229
0:14:3,72 --> 0:14:5,701
in any optimized
scientific sense


230
0:14:5,701 --> 0:14:9,583
as such a means is, as will be
described more so in a moment,


231
0:14:9,583 --> 0:14:14,916
also counter to the inherent logic
of the market system itself.


232
0:14:14,916 --> 0:14:18,229
These, coupled with many
other serious parameters


233
0:14:18,229 --> 0:14:23,268
needed for a truly efficient economy,
are simply ignored or, even worse,


234
0:14:23,268 --> 0:14:27,453
assumed to be inherent to the
price mechanism's function


235
0:14:27,453 --> 0:14:31,21
when they clearly are not.


236
0:14:31,21 --> 0:14:34,66
You see, the price mechanism's
concept of efficiency


237
0:14:34,66 --> 0:14:37,77
translates the subjective
mass interaction of consumers


238
0:14:37,77 --> 0:14:41,946
into the narrow assessments of regional
demand, production and distribution.


239
0:14:41,946 --> 0:14:45,913
It has nothing to do with how or why the
methods of industry are what they are.


240
0:14:45,913 --> 0:14:48,839
Such factors are left up to
the whim of the producers


241
0:14:48,839 --> 0:14:52,125
operating for profit alone,
completely decoupling


242
0:14:52,125 --> 0:14:56,878
from the natural regulation of
scientific principles of sustainability.


243
0:14:56,878 --> 0:15:1,602
Aww, man!


244
0:15:1,602 --> 0:15:4,24
You see, at the core of
'The Economic Calculation Problem'


245
0:15:4,24 --> 0:15:6,812
is really the argument that
we are completely irrational,


246
0:15:6,812 --> 0:15:11,0
that we can't possibly be organized in
a way that is structurally efficient;


247
0:15:11,0 --> 0:15:13,162
we are too insane, essentially.


248
0:15:13,162 --> 0:15:16,1
Therefore, we have to have
a general economic anarchy


249
0:15:16,1 --> 0:15:20,622
to organize our society and
there's no other way around it.


250
0:15:20,622 --> 0:15:21,84
(*Bullshit!*)


251
0:15:21,84 --> 0:15:25,497
Again, today is very different than
it was prior, and a quick review


252
0:15:25,497 --> 0:15:28,814
of modern computer programming
and systems engineering


253
0:15:28,814 --> 0:15:31,96
will tell you that not only can
the algorithmic intelligence


254
0:15:31,96 --> 0:15:35,321
of our sensory and measurement
technology today,


255
0:15:35,321 --> 0:15:38,807
coupled with synergistic
computer calculation,


256
0:15:38,807 --> 0:15:42,412
orient all the previously existing
factors taken into account


257
0:15:42,412 --> 0:15:44,543
by the price mechanism
as we know it,


258
0:15:44,543 --> 0:15:48,542
the truly relevant yet missing
factors for optimal efficiency


259
0:15:48,542 --> 0:15:51,807
and sustainability could be
brought into the equation.


260
0:15:51,807 --> 0:15:56,148
This would be the making of a true
economic calculation for industry,


261
0:15:56,148 --> 0:16:0,834
not the crude truncated data
put forward by price alone.


262
0:16:0,834 --> 0:16:3,657
So, coming back to our
household, the Earth,


263
0:16:3,657 --> 0:16:9,39
what is this thing really? It's a system,
a system of symbiotic laws.


264
0:16:9,39 --> 0:16:11,638
At the core of all
principles of sustainability


265
0:16:11,638 --> 0:16:15,926
is recognition of the largest order
system we can find, for reference.


266
0:16:15,926 --> 0:16:19,329
The price mechanism on the other...
[crash]


267
0:16:19,329 --> 0:16:22,547
Bob, what was that?


268
0:16:22,547 --> 0:16:25,169
Jesus Christ, Louie!


269
0:16:25,169 --> 0:16:28,17
Bob, why didn't you tell
me Louie was here already?


270
0:16:28,17 --> 0:16:30,979
Ladies and gentlemen, we have a special
guest here on Culture in Decline,


271
0:16:30,979 --> 0:16:34,578
our local logic guru,
Louie-the-Logic Gremlin.


272
0:16:34,578 --> 0:16:39,975
Louie has a severe impatience for
anything illogical, and he works to...


273
0:16:39,975 --> 0:16:42,881
OK. Bob, you've got to get the goddamn
Demo-Publican back in his cage


274
0:16:42,881 --> 0:16:50,414
or Louie is going to freak out...
Oh, shit! Cut the camera!


275
0:16:50,414 --> 0:16:53,3
Sorry about that ladies and gentlemen.
As I mentioned,


276
0:16:53,3 --> 0:16:56,576
Louie here gets a little frustrated
when it comes to anything illogical


277
0:16:56,576 --> 0:17:0,256
and the Demo-Publican is
sort of his mortal enemy.


278
0:17:0,256 --> 0:17:3,8
Anyway, Louie, since we have you here,
I want to ask you a few questions.


279
0:17:3,8 --> 0:17:6,21
Is the free market actually


280
0:17:6,21 --> 0:17:29,179
a good basis for sustainability
for the human species?


281
0:17:29,179 --> 0:17:32,425
Well, what about infinite
wants and human needs?


282
0:17:32,425 --> 0:18:38,489
How do we calculate
such complexity?


283
0:18:38,489 --> 0:18:41,114
Thank you very much Louie,
I appreciate that.


284
0:18:41,114 --> 0:18:43,0
Well, there you have it, folks.


285
0:18:43,0 --> 0:18:47,844
However, logic aside, opinions about our
economic system range dramatically.


286
0:18:47,844 --> 0:18:51,54
So, to gain some public consensus
on the issue, we now go live


287
0:18:51,54 --> 0:18:54,367
to our New York 'Culture
In Decline' correspondent,


288
0:18:54,367 --> 0:18:57,651
Big Scotty D, who is
live on Wall Street.


289
0:18:57,651 --> 0:19:1,452
Thank you, Peter. This is Scotty D, in
front of the New York Stock Exchange.


290
0:19:1,452 --> 0:19:3,805
Today we're here
in New York City


291
0:19:3,805 --> 0:19:7,682
just to try to talk to some people on
the street and find out a little bit


292
0:19:7,682 --> 0:19:11,64
about what's going on in the
world perception of economics.


293
0:19:11,64 --> 0:19:14,693
Culture In Decline:
Man On the Street


294
0:19:14,693 --> 0:19:17,867
Sir, do you want to
talk about the economy?


295
0:19:17,867 --> 0:19:23,0
Would you like to talk
about the economy?


296
0:19:23,0 --> 0:19:26,313
Would you like to talk
about the economy?


297
0:19:26,313 --> 0:19:28,385
I really suck at this,


298
0:19:28,385 --> 0:19:36,0
but I don't think people want
to talk about economy either.


299
0:19:36,0 --> 0:19:39,524
However, there was one guy who
was willing to talk to me.


300
0:19:39,524 --> 0:19:41,944
- What do you feel is the
definition of economics?


301
0:19:41,944 --> 0:19:44,482
Standing here in front of Wall
Street, I'm just curious.


302
0:19:44,482 --> 0:19:46,736
What do you think economics is?


303
0:19:46,736 --> 0:19:51,4
- Well, I would say that
economics is, is really just


304
0:19:51,4 --> 0:19:54,913
just based on money, the
things that's going on,


305
0:19:54,913 --> 0:19:59,276
you know, from over
here by Wall Street.


306
0:19:59,276 --> 0:20:5,255
It's just money that
makes the system ...


307
0:20:5,255 --> 0:20:10,0
generate throughout NY city and
for everybody in the world.


308
0:20:10,0 --> 0:20:13,61
But it's just mainly a money thing,
which makes the world go round.


309
0:20:13,61 --> 0:20:15,271
I know what you are thinking.
You're thinking


310
0:20:15,271 --> 0:20:18,396
"What is this guy talking about?!"


311
0:20:18,396 --> 0:20:21,717
But in reality, he probably
knows as much about economics


312
0:20:21,717 --> 0:20:24,771
as I know about interviewing
people on the street.


313
0:20:24,771 --> 0:20:26,674
And, seems like most of us


314
0:20:26,674 --> 0:20:29,44
really don't know what the
economy is all about anyway.


315
0:20:29,44 --> 0:20:32,523
Back to you, Peter.
*Man On The Streets*


316
0:20:32,523 --> 0:20:34,482
Is it me or have
you noticed that


317
0:20:34,482 --> 0:20:37,187
there is more for sale in
the world than ever before,


318
0:20:37,187 --> 0:20:40,259
and I'm not referring to
goods in your local store.


319
0:20:40,259 --> 0:20:43,1
Today, the market
rational is that


320
0:20:43,1 --> 0:20:46,341
everything is for sale
and nothing is sacred.


321
0:20:46,341 --> 0:20:50,625
Need some cash? Why don't you rent out
your forehead to commercial advertising?


322
0:20:50,625 --> 0:20:53,553
Or better yet, why don't you
buy the life insurance policy


323
0:20:53,553 --> 0:20:56,0
of your elderly neighbor,
and when she dies


324
0:20:56,0 --> 0:20:59,402
you can get nice payout?
Yep, it's legal!


325
0:20:59,402 --> 0:21:1,762
Or maybe it's the little
things that make you happy.


326
0:21:1,762 --> 0:21:4,343
So, rather than put that
blow-up doll in your car


327
0:21:4,343 --> 0:21:9,631
to use the car pool
lane (hehehehe),


328
0:21:9,631 --> 0:21:12,835
just buy it, like you
can in Minneapolis.


329
0:21:12,835 --> 0:21:17,71
Or maybe you have an itch to slaughter
that endangered black rhino in Africa.


330
0:21:17,71 --> 0:21:20,936
Well, you can.
Costs you about $150,000,


331
0:21:20,936 --> 0:21:23,461
but hey, it's there. '150,


332
0:21:23,461 --> 0:21:25,868
boy, I can't wait
to eat that rhino!'


333
0:21:25,868 --> 0:21:29,879
Or more seriously, maybe your kids
are not excelling well in school.


334
0:21:29,879 --> 0:21:32,416
Well, the market has a solution.
Pay them!


335
0:21:32,416 --> 0:21:36,581
Pay them to read and get good grades,
like they do in Dallas, Texas.


336
0:21:36,581 --> 0:21:40,476
But perhaps that is overkill, because
by the time they hit college age


337
0:21:40,476 --> 0:21:43,874
most prestigious universities will
look the other way for admission


338
0:21:43,874 --> 0:21:48,753
once a nice hefty donation is
made for that new library wing.


339
0:21:48,753 --> 0:21:51,482
Want to serve your country,
but are tired of all those


340
0:21:51,482 --> 0:21:54,364
pesky UN war rules and poor pay?


341
0:21:54,364 --> 0:21:58,27
Just join the growing legion of
private military contractors


342
0:21:58,27 --> 0:22:1,501
who are slowly replacing the
US military in general.


343
0:22:1,501 --> 0:22:3,361
Or how about love?


344
0:22:3,361 --> 0:22:6,202
Need a date, but don't want
to wade through all the fog?


345
0:22:6,202 --> 0:22:10,135
Women will now go on dates with the
highest bidder on some dating sites.


346
0:22:10,135 --> 0:22:13,55
Forget chatting, just fork
out a couple hundred bucks


347
0:22:13,55 --> 0:22:16,467
to entice the woman of your choice
to allow you to pay for her dinner.


348
0:22:16,467 --> 0:22:19,389
I am sure it will be a
long lasting relationship.


349
0:22:19,389 --> 0:22:21,361
Or perhaps most important,


350
0:22:21,361 --> 0:22:24,497
does your business need a law
passed to secure profits?


351
0:22:24,497 --> 0:22:27,295
Well, just hire a lobbyist
to influence Congress!


352
0:22:27,295 --> 0:22:30,267
As the prior episode of
Culture In Decline denoted,


353
0:22:30,267 --> 0:22:33,335
there is nothing in the
political and legal spectrum


354
0:22:33,335 --> 0:22:35,496
that is not clearly for sale.


355
0:22:35,496 --> 0:22:38,924
In fact, why do you think the
court system allows most offenses


356
0:22:38,924 --> 0:22:41,776
to be cleared with
monetary funds?


357
0:22:41,776 --> 0:22:45,871
But even if you do something really
bad and you are stuck in jail


358
0:22:45,871 --> 0:22:48,44
don't fret, because
in some cases


359
0:22:48,44 --> 0:22:51,75
you can about pay 80 bucks
a night for a nice upgrade


360
0:22:51,75 --> 0:22:56,251
to a clean quiet jail cell in
a nice area of the prison.


361
0:22:56,251 --> 0:22:59,989
You name it, you can buy
it, and nothing is sacred.


362
0:22:59,989 --> 0:23:4,827
143 years after the passage of the
13th Amendment of the US Constitution


363
0:23:4,827 --> 0:23:9,665
and 60 years after Article 4 of the UN's
Universal Declaration of Human Rights


364
0:23:9,665 --> 0:23:12,767
banned slavery and the
slave trade worldwide,


365
0:23:12,767 --> 0:23:16,161
there are today more slaves
than anytime in human history,


366
0:23:16,161 --> 0:23:20,452
trafficking about 30 million
for various profit schemes.


367
0:23:20,452 --> 0:23:22,993
But, what about ethics,
you might ask?


368
0:23:22,993 --> 0:23:25,821
Well, what about it?
Ethics and morality


369
0:23:25,821 --> 0:23:29,25
continue to be redefined by the
economic ethos of the day,


370
0:23:29,25 --> 0:23:32,129
and when a Wall Street trader
makes millions of dollars


371
0:23:32,129 --> 0:23:36,111
betting against the currency and
hence prosperity of another country,


372
0:23:36,111 --> 0:23:39,265
I can assure you he is
sleeping like a baby at night,


373
0:23:39,265 --> 0:23:42,425
and why shouldn't he?
He is simply doing what is rewarded


374
0:23:42,425 --> 0:23:45,758
and reinforced by the
economic system-at-large.


375
0:23:45,758 --> 0:23:47,978
The market's inherent psychology


376
0:23:47,978 --> 0:23:51,516
has nothing to do with anything
except its own perpetuation.


377
0:23:51,516 --> 0:23:55,267
When you hear politicians tell you that
they are invading some poor country


378
0:23:55,267 --> 0:23:57,794
to bring freedom and democracy,


379
0:23:57,794 --> 0:24:0,948
you need to understand what
those words really imply.


380
0:24:0,948 --> 0:24:3,3
The freedom they bring
is market freedom,


381
0:24:3,3 --> 0:24:7,0
and the democracy that they bring is
the democracy of purchasing power:


382
0:24:7,0 --> 0:24:9,38
the freedom of using
money for influence,


383
0:24:9,38 --> 0:24:14,139
the freedom to, in fact,
restrict the freedom of others.


384
0:24:14,139 --> 0:24:16,762
However, let's get back
to this technical stuff.


385
0:24:16,762 --> 0:24:19,686
Putting aside the distortion
of market rationale


386
0:24:19,686 --> 0:24:21,707
that now puts
everything for sale,


387
0:24:21,707 --> 0:24:24,347
putting aside the false premise
that the price mechanism


388
0:24:24,347 --> 0:24:27,379
actually properly calculates
the true attributes


389
0:24:27,379 --> 0:24:30,495
of a sustainable and
efficient economic practice,


390
0:24:30,495 --> 0:24:34,16
and putting aside the basic
value system disorder


391
0:24:34,16 --> 0:24:37,139
radiating out of the overall
basis of unfolding,


392
0:24:37,139 --> 0:24:43,139
let's now take a little quiz.
Welcome to modern Economics 101.


393
0:24:43,139 --> 0:24:45,563
Question 1: If you
lived on a planet


394
0:24:45,563 --> 0:24:48,295
with finite resources and
an expanding population,


395
0:24:48,295 --> 0:24:52,326
would you encourage an economy based
on the need for growth and consumption


396
0:24:52,326 --> 0:24:54,379
to keep everything going?


397
0:24:54,379 --> 0:24:56,661
Correct answer: No.


398
0:24:56,661 --> 0:25:0,882
The fact that our economy literally
requires constant consumption and growth


399
0:25:0,882 --> 0:25:3,999
to keep GDP afloat
and people employed


400
0:25:3,999 --> 0:25:8,804
is the hallmark of not an
economy, but an anti-economy.


401
0:25:8,804 --> 0:25:11,433
Question 2: If you
were a producer


402
0:25:11,433 --> 0:25:14,575
would you make goods to be as
durable and adaptable as possible


403
0:25:14,575 --> 0:25:16,709
given the finite nature of resources


404
0:25:16,709 --> 0:25:19,804
in an interest to maximize
labor productivity?


405
0:25:19,804 --> 0:25:22,833
Answer: Yes.
Today it's the opposite,


406
0:25:22,833 --> 0:25:26,456
and not only are all goods
inferior the moment they are made


407
0:25:26,456 --> 0:25:30,763
due to the cost-efficiency needs for
corporations to remain competitive,


408
0:25:30,763 --> 0:25:35,139
most companies also engage in what
is called planned obsolescence


409
0:25:35,139 --> 0:25:39,39
which deliberately reduces good quality
to encourage repeat purchases


410
0:25:39,39 --> 0:25:41,193
for more profit.


411
0:25:41,193 --> 0:25:44,721
Question 3: If you were a
socio-economic planner,


412
0:25:44,721 --> 0:25:48,0
would you encourage everyone
to buy one of everything,


413
0:25:48,0 --> 0:25:51,265
hoarding that personal
property, protectively,


414
0:25:51,265 --> 0:25:54,757
even though many goods
are used infrequently?


415
0:25:54,757 --> 0:25:57,969
Answer: No.
That would be inefficient.


416
0:25:57,969 --> 0:26:1,951
The reality that goods are only as
relevant as their use would be realized


417
0:26:1,951 --> 0:26:4,515
and hence a system
of shared access,


418
0:26:4,515 --> 0:26:7,409
not blind restrictive
universal ownership,


419
0:26:7,409 --> 0:26:10,664
would be the most rational
manner of unfolding.


420
0:26:10,664 --> 0:26:12,982
Question 4: What
about incentive?


421
0:26:12,982 --> 0:26:15,395
Would you push a cut-throat,
competititve environment


422
0:26:15,395 --> 0:26:18,927
where everyone it is out for
themselves or their little group?


423
0:26:18,927 --> 0:26:22,248
Correct answer: No.
Knowing what we know today


424
0:26:22,248 --> 0:26:25,286
about the competitive mentality
and how it creates abuse,


425
0:26:25,286 --> 0:26:29,449
along with the reality that collaboration
and the sharing of information


426
0:26:29,449 --> 0:26:33,0
is truly the driver of
progress on the social level,


427
0:26:33,0 --> 0:26:36,875
competition would be seen as the
most limiting of arrangements


428
0:26:36,875 --> 0:26:39,1
as a philosophical practice.


429
0:26:39,1 --> 0:26:42,556
Question 5: What would be
the basis for reward today?


430
0:26:42,556 --> 0:26:46,214
Would you require every human to
submit to each other for labor


431
0:26:46,214 --> 0:26:48,771
as to achieve the
means for survival?


432
0:26:48,771 --> 0:26:51,694
No. That would be crude
and counter-productive,


433
0:26:51,694 --> 0:26:54,219
given the state of technology.


434
0:26:54,219 --> 0:26:58,0
Modern technical capacity has the
ability to increase productivity


435
0:26:58,0 --> 0:27:0,369
beyond anything known
in human history,


436
0:27:0,369 --> 0:27:4,36
not to mention secure more safety
and efficiency in general.


437
0:27:4,36 --> 0:27:6,483
To push human labor for income


438
0:27:6,483 --> 0:27:12,11
in the face of this tool for
vast improvement is just absurd.


439
0:27:12,11 --> 0:27:16,607
Final thoughts: If we were to
take a step back and reflect upon


440
0:27:16,607 --> 0:27:20,629
how our human family is behaving
across the world today,


441
0:27:20,629 --> 0:27:24,527
from Western materialism
to Islamic extremism,


442
0:27:24,527 --> 0:27:27,587
from nuclear war to necrophilia,


443
0:27:27,587 --> 0:27:32,337
we are faced with a dark, yet
extremely entertaining reality.


444
0:27:32,337 --> 0:27:36,11
The very real fact [is] that
we are monkeys in the wild,


445
0:27:36,11 --> 0:27:38,505
barely out of the
jungle on this planet


446
0:27:38,505 --> 0:27:41,73
in the words of the late,
great George Carlin,


447
0:27:41,73 --> 0:27:43,828
inching out of the
Dark Ages, in fact,


448
0:27:43,828 --> 0:27:48,139
from a period of deep fear and
confusion with respect to who we are,


449
0:27:48,139 --> 0:27:51,296
what we are doing, how
we relate to each other,


450
0:27:51,296 --> 0:27:55,139
not to mention how we relate to
the habitat that spawned us.


451
0:27:55,139 --> 0:27:59,139
On one side of the spectrum we have
a vast spectacle of human conceit:


452
0:27:59,139 --> 0:28:3,84
stubborn ignorance, so much
so that if you are like me,


453
0:28:3,84 --> 0:28:6,135
sometimes you wonder why
we should try at all.


454
0:28:6,135 --> 0:28:9,355
That maybe this species
deserves everything it gets


455
0:28:9,355 --> 0:28:12,139
and its fate as an
evolutionary cul-de-sac,


456
0:28:12,139 --> 0:28:18,713
a failed genetic mutation, might be
an ideal hope for this universe.


457
0:28:18,713 --> 0:28:20,864
Cynicism aside however,


458
0:28:20,864 --> 0:28:25,886
it's easy to see that there is a
growing change in the minority


459
0:28:25,886 --> 0:28:28,524
which will slowly become
majority if we let it.


460
0:28:28,524 --> 0:28:30,894
An awakening is
happening, an awakening


461
0:28:30,894 --> 0:28:34,212
where people have stopped
imposing their traditional ideals


462
0:28:34,212 --> 0:28:36,975
and various ideological
baggage on the world,


463
0:28:36,975 --> 0:28:39,832
and instead are
starting to listen,


464
0:28:39,832 --> 0:28:43,747
listening to what the tools of
our ingenuity have afforded us,


465
0:28:43,747 --> 0:28:47,161
listening to the message
of nature itself.


466
0:28:47,161 --> 0:28:50,274
If there is any context which
needs a serious intervention


467
0:28:50,274 --> 0:28:52,808
with respect to the natural
laws that govern us,


468
0:28:52,808 --> 0:28:57,69
if there is any context where we
need to simply pay attention,


469
0:28:57,69 --> 0:29:1,331
prepare to drop all of our prior
assumptions and change accordingly,


470
0:29:1,331 --> 0:29:4,624
it is in the economic context.


471
0:29:4,624 --> 0:29:7,668
Economics is not just some
arbitrary abstraction


472
0:29:7,668 --> 0:29:10,126
for processing and
distributing resources.


473
0:29:10,126 --> 0:29:15,288
It is an underlying value molder that
programs us into modes of behavior


474
0:29:15,288 --> 0:29:18,207
that extend into all
areas of our psychology.


475
0:29:18,207 --> 0:29:22,351
It is the active global religion
whether people like it or not,


476
0:29:22,351 --> 0:29:27,0
and for those of us that wish to
see reason triumph over dogma,


477
0:29:27,0 --> 0:29:30,785
we have a long, long road ahead.


478
0:29:30,785 --> 0:29:33,826
Advocates of the free-market
model of economics will tell you


479
0:29:33,826 --> 0:29:37,716
that there is no other system
possible to calculate society,


480
0:29:37,716 --> 0:29:40,143
that the competitive
basis is the only way


481
0:29:40,143 --> 0:29:42,544
to incentivize our
primitive culture.


482
0:29:42,544 --> 0:29:46,275
They will tell you that reduced
economic interference of government


483
0:29:46,275 --> 0:29:51,1
is the key to preserving the true
integrity of the market economy


484
0:29:51,1 --> 0:29:53,773
and also preserve our
so-called liberty,


485
0:29:53,773 --> 0:29:56,59
which they say would
be quickly corrupted


486
0:29:56,59 --> 0:29:58,685
as tyranny and
oppression must occur


487
0:29:58,685 --> 0:30:4,28
if any type of collaborative, designed
economic practice was applied.


488
0:30:4,28 --> 0:30:6,84
They talk of the
'true' free market:


489
0:30:6,84 --> 0:30:10,303
a utopian ideal that
claims the invisible hand,


490
0:30:10,303 --> 0:30:14,407
if allowed to run without interference,
would alleviate the poverty,


491
0:30:14,407 --> 0:30:18,43
deprivation, abuse, corruption,
conflict and inefficiency


492
0:30:18,43 --> 0:30:21,284
so common in the world today.


493
0:30:21,284 --> 0:30:25,506
Well, as with all religions,
delusion is common,


494
0:30:25,506 --> 0:30:28,84
because today the market is
actually more free than ever


495
0:30:28,84 --> 0:30:32,38
with the state being nothing
more than a parent corporation


496
0:30:32,38 --> 0:30:37,326
working to assist its commercial
subsidiaries which support it.


497
0:30:37,326 --> 0:30:42,71
Everything is for sale, and
no one is accountable.


498
0:30:42,71 --> 0:30:47,0
All natural laws and physical realities
that would comprise the basis


499
0:30:47,0 --> 0:30:50,644
for true technical
earthly efficiency


500
0:30:50,644 --> 0:30:53,44
and awareness and reasoning
that, if allowed,


501
0:30:53,44 --> 0:30:56,483
can literally transform
the world into a place


502
0:30:56,483 --> 0:31:0,53
with vast abundance and
prosperity never before seen,


503
0:31:0,53 --> 0:31:3,0
have been buried and dismissed,


504
0:31:3,0 --> 0:31:7,119
only to be overshadowed by a
certain kind of efficiency,


505
0:31:7,119 --> 0:31:11,726
market efficiency, an efficiency
that tracks money and money alone,


506
0:31:11,726 --> 0:31:14,198
an efficiency that is
literally decoupled


507
0:31:14,198 --> 0:31:17,286
from everything that supports
and secures life itself,


508
0:31:17,286 --> 0:31:20,208
an efficiency that is
circular in its reasoning


509
0:31:20,208 --> 0:31:24,414
as it has no recognition of
the physical laws of nature,


510
0:31:24,414 --> 0:31:28,697
the laws of nature, which are, in
fact, the only real true government


511
0:31:28,697 --> 0:31:33,641
and regulatory system that
has or will ever exist.


512
0:31:33,641 --> 0:31:36,356
But then again, who
is to say it matters?


513
0:31:36,356 --> 0:31:39,755
Maybe we should all
just take it in stride.


514
0:31:39,755 --> 0:31:43,2
Maybe this reality
show of humankind,


515
0:31:43,2 --> 0:31:46,619
this satirical tragic parody
of itself, to be sure,


516
0:31:46,619 --> 0:31:50,197
doing all it knows, maybe
this is the way it is


517
0:31:50,197 --> 0:31:53,0
and our brains, our
genes are messed up,


518
0:31:53,0 --> 0:31:55,705
and we are just waiting
for the final laugh track


519
0:31:55,705 --> 0:32:1,662
when Spaceship Earth slams into
that psychological brick wall.


520
0:32:1,662 --> 0:32:3,896
I guess time will tell.


521
0:32:3,896 --> 0:32:7,67
And until then, sit
back, grab some popcorn


522
0:32:7,67 --> 0:32:10,467
and keep watching the greatest
reality show of all time.


523
0:32:10,467 --> 0:32:13,589
And until next time,
I am Peter Joseph,


524
0:32:13,589 --> 0:33:5,657
an agent and victim of
a Culture in Decline.


525
0:33:5,657 --> 0:35:5,657
Would you like to talk
about the economy?
