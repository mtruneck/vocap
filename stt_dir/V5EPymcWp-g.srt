Male announcer: ladies
and gentlemen, welcome.


3
0:2:47,2 --> 0:2:48,8
Today it is
my distinct pleasure


4
0:2:48,8 --> 0:2:50,6
To introduce a man
who is recognized--


5
0:2:50,6 --> 0:2:53,5
The battle over evolution
is only one skirmish


6
0:2:53,5 --> 0:2:56,9
In a much larger war.


7
0:2:56,9 --> 0:3:3,3
Science simply makes no use
of the hypothesis of God.


8
0:3:3,3 --> 0:3:8,5
Ask yourself, what has
intelligent design given us?
Nothing.


9
0:3:8,5 --> 0:3:11,8
We cannot accept
intelligent design


10
0:3:11,8 --> 0:3:15,2
As an alternative
scientific theory.

They will never accept
that we have a better argument.


12

Today, ben is speaking
on the topic


16
0:3:33,3 --> 0:3:37,0
That has become
increasingly important
to him over recent years.


17

While ben has always been
an ardent supporter of science,


18
0:3:40,5 --> 0:3:42,8
Lately he has noticed
an alarming trend


19
0:3:42,8 --> 0:3:44,5
In the scientific
establishment


20
0:3:44,5 --> 0:3:46,6
That could have
dire consequences

For every american.

Freedom is
the essence of america.


32
0:4:15,2 --> 0:4:18,2
We're talking
about freedom of speech,


33
0:4:18,2 --> 0:4:20,0
Freedom of assembly,


34
0:4:20,0 --> 0:4:24,1
Freedom from fear,
freedom of religion.


35
0:4:24,1 --> 0:4:25,4
Martin luther king said,


36
0:4:25,4 --> 0:4:28,1
"america is
essentially a dream,"


37
0:4:28,1 --> 0:4:31,5
And he said it is a dream
of freedom and equality.


38
0:4:31,5 --> 0:4:33,9
Freedom is the way
to equality.


39
0:4:33,9 --> 0:4:37,9
And america simply would
not be america without freedom.


40
0:4:37,9 --> 0:4:40,4
In every turning point
in our history,


41
0:4:40,4 --> 0:4:44,1
The decision has always
been about freedom.


42
0:4:44,1 --> 0:4:46,8
[stein narrates]
freedom is what makes
this country great.


43
0:4:46,8 --> 0:4:51,3
Freedom has allowed us
to create, to explore,


44
0:4:51,3 --> 0:4:55,5
To overcome every challenge
we have faced as a nation.


45
0:4:55,5 --> 0:4:59,5
But imagine if these freedoms
were taken away.


46
0:4:59,5 --> 0:5:2,9
Where would we be?
What would we lose?


47
0:5:2,9 --> 0:5:6,8
Well, unfortunately,
I no longer need to imagine.


48
0:5:6,8 --> 0:5:7,8
It's happening.


49
0:5:7,8 --> 0:5:9,1
We are losing our freedom


50
0:5:9,1 --> 0:5:12,2
In one of the most important
sectors of society--


51
0:5:12,2 --> 0:5:13,9
Science.


52
0:5:13,9 --> 0:5:15,3
I have always assumed


53
0:5:15,3 --> 0:5:18,0
That scientists were free
to ask any question,


54
0:5:18,0 --> 0:5:20,1
To pursue
any line of inquiry


55
0:5:20,1 --> 0:5:22,5
Without fear of reprisal,


56
0:5:22,5 --> 0:5:25,3
But recently
i've been alarmed to discover


57
0:5:25,3 --> 0:5:27,1
That this is not the case.


58
0:5:27,1 --> 0:5:29,5
It all began when I met


59
0:5:29,5 --> 0:5:32,1
Evolutionary biologist
richard sternberg


60
0:5:32,1 --> 0:5:33,7
In washington, d.C.


61
0:5:33,7 --> 0:5:35,7
His life was nearly ruined


62
0:5:35,7 --> 0:5:37,7
When he strayed
from the party line


63
0:5:37,7 --> 0:5:40,3

of a scientific journal


64

65
0:5:42,0 --> 0:5:45,5

of natural history.


66
0:5:45,5 --> 0:5:47,2
Your office
was over there?


67
0:5:47,2 --> 0:5:48,2
That's correct.


68
0:5:48,2 --> 0:5:50,0
This here
is the west wing.


69
0:5:50,0 --> 0:5:51,8
Directly ahead of us
is the west wing


70
0:5:51,8 --> 0:5:53,3
Of the natural history
museum.


71
0:5:53,3 --> 0:5:54,7
So now you're
not there anymore


72
0:5:54,7 --> 0:5:56,0
Because you were
a bad boy.


73
0:5:56,0 --> 0:5:57,8
No, i'm not.
No, I was exiled.


74
0:5:57,8 --> 0:5:59,1
You were a bad boy.


75
0:5:59,1 --> 0:6:3,2
You questioned
the powers that be.

0:6:3,2 --> 0:6:6,9
[typewriter clacking]


77
0:6:6,9 --> 0:6:9,9
What was
dr. Sternberg's crime?


78
0:6:9,9 --> 0:6:13,0
He dared to publish an article
by dr. Stephen meyer,


79
0:6:13,0 --> 0:6:14,5
One of the leading lights


80
0:6:14,5 --> 0:6:16,7
Of the intelligent design
movement.


81
0:6:16,7 --> 0:6:19,5
The paper ignited
a firestorm of controversy


82
0:6:19,5 --> 0:6:22,4
Merely because it suggested
intelligent design


83
0:6:22,4 --> 0:6:25,5
Might be able to explain
how life began.


84
0:6:25,5 --> 0:6:28,7
As a result,
dr. Sternberg lost his office,


85
0:6:28,7 --> 0:6:32,0
His political
and religious beliefs
were investigated,


86
0:6:32,0 --> 0:6:34,4
And he was pressured
to resign.


87
0:6:34,4 --> 0:6:35,9
The questioning
of darwinism


88
0:6:35,9 --> 0:6:39,9
Was a bridge too far
for many.


89
0:6:39,9 --> 0:6:42,9
The mentioning
of intelligent design


90
0:6:42,9 --> 0:6:47,5
That occurs
at the end of the paper
was over the top.


91
0:6:47,5 --> 0:6:51,0
And I think
the intelligent design
proponents


92
0:6:51,0 --> 0:6:54,0
Have raised a number
of very important questions.


93
0:6:54,0 --> 0:6:56,1
And you wanted to get
those questions


94
0:6:56,1 --> 0:6:57,3
Brought up and discussed.


95
0:6:57,3 --> 0:6:59,2
- placed on the table.
- placed on the table.


96
0:6:59,2 --> 0:7:2,6
People were so upset
about it.


97
0:7:2,6 --> 0:7:4,7
They were so upset
that you could see their--


98
0:7:4,7 --> 0:7:6,7
They had a physical
emotional reaction.


99
0:7:6,7 --> 0:7:8,1
Wow.


100
0:7:8,1 --> 0:7:10,5
They were saying


101
0:7:10,5 --> 0:7:14,7
That stephen c. Meyer
is a well-known Christian,


102
0:7:14,7 --> 0:7:17,7
That stephen c. Meyer
is an intelligent design
proponent,


103
0:7:17,7 --> 0:7:20,3
That stephen c. Meyer
is a republican.


104
0:7:20,3 --> 0:7:21,8
It was all couched
in terms of


105
0:7:21,8 --> 0:7:25,0
Religion, politics,
and sociology.


106
0:7:25,0 --> 0:7:28,5
The way the chair
of the department put it


107
0:7:28,5 --> 0:7:32,8
Is that I was viewed
as an intellectual terrorist.


108
0:7:32,8 --> 0:7:34,0
Terrorist?


109
0:7:34,0 --> 0:7:38,2
Because of
giving the topic


110
0:7:38,2 --> 0:7:44,1
Of intelligent design
some modicum of credibility.


111
0:7:44,1 --> 0:7:46,6
What happened
to dr. Sternberg was terrible,


112
0:7:46,6 --> 0:7:48,8
But surely it was
just an isolated case.


113
0:7:48,8 --> 0:7:50,6
I was still
pretty skeptical,


114
0:7:50,6 --> 0:7:52,7
So naturally
I checked in with the head


115
0:7:52,7 --> 0:7:55,1
Of the skeptics society,
michael shermer.


116
0:7:55,1 --> 0:7:58,6
So I can't prove
there is no God,


117
0:7:58,6 --> 0:8:0,6
Or yahweh in your case,


118
0:8:0,6 --> 0:8:3,5
Any more than I can prove
there is no isis, zeus,


119
0:8:3,5 --> 0:8:6,7
Apollo, brahma, ganesha,
mithras, allah,


120
0:8:6,7 --> 0:8:9,4
Or for that matter,
the flying spaghetti monster.


121
0:8:9,4 --> 0:8:11,0
And think about just
one thing:


122
0:8:11,0 --> 0:8:13,0
Why would the aliens
look like this?


123
0:8:13,0 --> 0:8:17,0
- these are bipedal--
- king: who drew that?


124
0:8:17,0 --> 0:8:19,7
Shermer: skepticism...
It's not a position you take.


125
0:8:19,7 --> 0:8:21,8
It's just
an approach to claims.


126
0:8:21,8 --> 0:8:25,8
This one's called
the borderlands of science:
where sense meets nonsense.


127
0:8:25,8 --> 0:8:27,7
Is intelligent design
nonsense?


128
0:8:27,7 --> 0:8:29,7
Well, it's unproven,


129
0:8:29,7 --> 0:8:31,3
So in that sense
it's nonsense.


130
0:8:31,3 --> 0:8:33,9
So I would put it
in the sort of shaded areas


131
0:8:33,9 --> 0:8:36,7
Between good, solid science
and total nonsense.


132
0:8:36,7 --> 0:8:41,9
You know, it's sort of
three quarters of the way
toward the nonsense side.


133
0:8:41,9 --> 0:8:43,5
Stein: but you think,
nevertheless,


134
0:8:43,5 --> 0:8:45,2
People should be
allowed to speak about


135
0:8:45,2 --> 0:8:46,5
And publish papers
about it.


136
0:8:46,5 --> 0:8:48,8
They are free to write
and publish and be heard


137
0:8:48,8 --> 0:8:50,5
In public forums
and go to conferences


138
0:8:50,5 --> 0:8:52,1
Just like
everybody else does.


139
0:8:52,1 --> 0:8:55,2
What if a person
published something,
say, at the smithsonian


140
0:8:55,2 --> 0:8:59,0
In favor
of intelligent design
and lost his job over it?


141
0:8:59,0 --> 0:9:3,7
I mean, it had been
peer-reviewed and published


142
0:9:3,7 --> 0:9:5,7
And then he lost his job
over it anyway.


143
0:9:5,7 --> 0:9:7,0
What about
that situation?


144
0:9:7,0 --> 0:9:9,2
Well...I think
that particular situation,


145
0:9:9,2 --> 0:9:10,5
There was something else
going on.


146
0:9:10,5 --> 0:9:12,0
- what was going on?
- I don't know.


147
0:9:12,0 --> 0:9:13,9
I mean, I don't know
because I don't know,


148
0:9:13,9 --> 0:9:16,2
But I think there had
to be something.


149
0:9:16,2 --> 0:9:18,2
People don't get fired
over something like that.


150
0:9:18,2 --> 0:9:20,4
You roll up your sleeves,
you get to work,


151
0:9:20,4 --> 0:9:22,2
You do the research,
you get your grants,


152
0:9:22,2 --> 0:9:24,1
You get your data,
you publish,


153
0:9:24,1 --> 0:9:25,4
And you work
your butt off,


154
0:9:25,4 --> 0:9:27,4
And that's how you get
your theories taught--


155
0:9:27,4 --> 0:9:29,5
What if you try and try
and roll up your sleeves


156
0:9:29,5 --> 0:9:31,1
And go to work
and work your butt off,


157
0:9:31,1 --> 0:9:33,0
And they say,
"we're going to fire you


158
0:9:33,0 --> 0:9:35,0
If you even mention the word
intelligent design"?


159
0:9:35,0 --> 0:9:37,8
I don't think that's happened.
Where is that happening?

At george mason university,


170
0:10:1,3 --> 0:10:5,6
Her promising academic career
came to an abrupt end.


171
0:10:5,6 --> 0:10:8,2
My supervisor invited me
into his office.


172
0:10:8,2 --> 0:10:11,0
He said,
"i'm going to have
to discipline you


173
0:10:11,0 --> 0:10:13,0
For teaching creationism."


174
0:10:13,0 --> 0:10:15,2

you have to be disciplined."

At the end of the semester,
I lost my job.

interviewed for a job,

can google my name,

0:11:46,9 --> 0:11:49,8
And suggest that perhaps
it's time for me to retire.


213
0:11:49,8 --> 0:11:52,3
I realized when
I kind of went public


214
0:11:52,3 --> 0:11:55,5
With my doubts
about the adequacy
of darwin's theory,


215
0:11:55,5 --> 0:11:58,2
You know, that I would
encounter criticism.


216
0:11:58,2 --> 0:12:1,9
What has amazed me
is the viciousness


217
0:12:1,9 --> 0:12:6,3
And the sort
of baseness of it.


218
0:12:6,3 --> 0:12:8,2
I'm an old guy.
I have tenure.


219
0:12:8,2 --> 0:12:9,7
I'm academically safe.


220
0:12:9,7 --> 0:12:11,4
But the young people


221
0:12:11,4 --> 0:12:14,2
And what
is happening to them
in america right now


222
0:12:14,2 --> 0:12:16,6
Because of this
scientism gulag


223
0:12:16,6 --> 0:12:18,3
Is really terrible.


224
0:12:18,3 --> 0:12:20,2
Apparently professor marks


225
0:12:20,2 --> 0:12:22,1
Was not as safe
as he thought.


226
0:12:22,1 --> 0:12:24,3
A few months
after this interview,


227
0:12:24,3 --> 0:12:27,7
Baylor university shut down
his research web site


228
0:12:27,7 --> 0:12:30,1
And forced him
to return grant money


229
0:12:30,1 --> 0:12:31,6
Once they
discovered a link


230
0:12:31,6 --> 0:12:34,4
Between his work
and intelligent design.


231
0:12:34,4 --> 0:12:37,5
In order to attract grants,
you have to market yourself.


232
0:12:37,5 --> 0:12:39,0
So you put up sites
and call yourself


233
0:12:39,0 --> 0:12:41,0
"labs" and "groups"
and things like that


234
0:12:41,0 --> 0:12:42,7
In order to get
visibility.


235
0:12:42,7 --> 0:12:45,3
And in my entire
experience in academia


236
0:12:45,3 --> 0:12:47,3
I never went
to any superior


237
0:12:47,3 --> 0:12:49,3
And asked them
any permission


238
0:12:49,3 --> 0:12:51,4
To put up
any of these labs.


239
0:12:51,4 --> 0:12:54,9
So the fact that
this was singled out,


240
0:12:54,9 --> 0:12:58,7
Let alone shut down,
is jaw-dropping.
It's astonishing.


241
0:12:58,7 --> 0:13:2,8
I have never been treated
like this in my--


242
0:13:2,8 --> 0:13:4,6
About 30 years in academia.


243
0:13:4,6 --> 0:13:8,3
Shut up, you freak!
I said shut up!


244
0:13:8,3 --> 0:13:11,8
[echoing]
it's a madhouse!


245
0:13:11,8 --> 0:13:13,8
If you peel back
the onion,


246
0:13:13,8 --> 0:13:15,4
I think that
there's no doubt


247
0:13:15,4 --> 0:13:18,0
That the center
of this is my work


248
0:13:18,0 --> 0:13:22,1
In what some would call
intelligent design.


249
0:13:22,1 --> 0:13:25,5
Dr. Gonzalez:
people really get
emotional about this.


250
0:13:25,5 --> 0:13:29,2
Whenever you say
"intelligent design"
in a room of academics,


251
0:13:29,2 --> 0:13:32,0
Them's fighting words.


252
0:13:32,0 --> 0:13:33,2
Creationists!


253
0:13:33,2 --> 0:13:35,9
Astronomer
guillermo gonzalez


254
0:13:35,9 --> 0:13:38,7
Found himself
in a fierce shootout


255
0:13:38,7 --> 0:13:40,2
With iowa state university,


256
0:13:40,2 --> 0:13:42,2
Following the publication
of his book


257
0:13:42,2 --> 0:13:45,5
Arguing that the universe
is intelligently designed.


258
0:13:45,5 --> 0:13:48,2
Despite a stellar
research record


259
0:13:48,2 --> 0:13:51,3
That has led
to the discovery
of several planets,


260
0:13:51,3 --> 0:13:54,1
His application
for tenure was denied,


261
0:13:54,1 --> 0:13:55,9
Putting his career
in jeopardy.


262
0:13:55,9 --> 0:14:0,5
I worried about my tenure
a little bit in 2005


263
0:14:0,5 --> 0:14:3,6
When the petition
was being circulated


264
0:14:3,6 --> 0:14:5,3
Because I viewed
that as a strategy


265
0:14:5,3 --> 0:14:7,4
Of hector avalos
and his associates


266
0:14:7,4 --> 0:14:10,2
To try to poison
the atmosphere
on campus against me


267
0:14:10,2 --> 0:14:12,1
Because he knew I
wasn't tenured yet


268
0:14:12,1 --> 0:14:13,6
And I was
very vulnerable.


269
0:14:13,6 --> 0:14:15,9
I have little doubt that
I would have tenure now


270
0:14:15,9 --> 0:14:18,9
If I hadn't done
any professional work
on intelligent design.


271
0:14:18,9 --> 0:14:22,2
Dr. Gonzalez had
this advice for scientists


272
0:14:22,2 --> 0:14:25,0
Who might be thinking
about following his example.


273
0:14:25,0 --> 0:14:27,5
If they value
their careers--


274
0:14:27,5 --> 0:14:29,2
[laughs]
they should keep quiet


275
0:14:29,2 --> 0:14:31,5
About their
intelligent design views.


276
0:14:31,5 --> 0:14:34,2
We know there are times
and places to be quiet


277
0:14:34,2 --> 0:14:35,8
And other times and places


278
0:14:35,8 --> 0:14:38,0
When we can make noise
if we want to.


279
0:14:38,0 --> 0:14:40,9
- filmstrip narrator:
will you show us?
- of course.


280
0:14:40,9 --> 0:14:42,2
Boys and girls,


281
0:14:42,2 --> 0:14:43,8
How would you like to show


282
0:14:43,8 --> 0:14:46,5
Some of the ways we know
of being quiet?


283
0:14:46,5 --> 0:14:49,2
Man #1: it's the kind of thing
where you just learn
to keep your mouth shut.


284
0:14:49,2 --> 0:14:51,2
Stein: in addition
to those scientists


285
0:14:51,2 --> 0:14:52,7
Who were willing
to appear on camera,


286
0:14:52,7 --> 0:14:55,8
We encountered many more
who didn't dare show their face


287
0:14:55,8 --> 0:14:58,2
For fear of losing
their jobs.


288
0:14:58,2 --> 0:15:0,5
Man #2: you use
an intelligent design
perspective


289
0:15:0,5 --> 0:15:2,3
To get the research done,


290
0:15:2,3 --> 0:15:5,1
But you're not allowed
to talk about it in public.


291
0:15:5,1 --> 0:15:8,1
Man #3: and so there is
definitely incentive,
if you think about it,


292
0:15:8,1 --> 0:15:10,1
For people to remain
within the mainstream.


293
0:15:10,1 --> 0:15:12,1
Man #4: you know,
"what's he up to?


294
0:15:12,1 --> 0:15:14,7
What is he thinking?
Is he one of them?"
that kind of thing.


295
0:15:14,7 --> 0:15:16,5
Man #5: if I write
"intelligent design,"


296
0:15:16,5 --> 0:15:18,2
They hear "creationism,"


297
0:15:18,2 --> 0:15:22,1
They hear "religious right,"
they hear "theocracy."


298
0:15:22,1 --> 0:15:26,3
So it appears mr. Shermer,
the self-styled skeptic,


299
0:15:26,3 --> 0:15:27,8
Was wrong on this one.


300
0:15:27,8 --> 0:15:30,4
Intelligent design
was being suppressed


301
0:15:30,4 --> 0:15:32,9
In a systematic
and ruthless fashion.


302
0:15:32,9 --> 0:15:35,8
But maybe intelligent design
should be suppressed.


303
0:15:35,8 --> 0:15:38,0
I didn't like
what was happening
to these scientists,


304
0:15:38,0 --> 0:15:39,2
But on the other hand,


305
0:15:39,2 --> 0:15:40,7
We don't want
our kids being taught


306
0:15:40,7 --> 0:15:41,9
That the earth is flat


307
0:15:41,9 --> 0:15:44,2
Or the the holocaust
never happened.


308
0:15:44,2 --> 0:15:46,6
It was time to ask
the scientific establishment


309
0:15:46,6 --> 0:15:50,0
What was so bad
about intelligent design.


310
0:15:50,0 --> 0:15:52,5
Intelligent design people
are not genuine scientists.


311
0:15:52,5 --> 0:15:54,3
Intelligent design
is a racket.


312
0:15:54,3 --> 0:15:56,2
It's just propaganda.


313
0:15:56,2 --> 0:15:58,1
The only intelligent
thing about it


314
0:15:58,1 --> 0:16:0,1
Is to have got people
to call it that.


315
0:16:0,1 --> 0:16:2,6
It's really
very stupid, as well.


316
0:16:2,6 --> 0:16:4,7
Everybody knows
science education


317
0:16:4,7 --> 0:16:6,3
In america
is appalling.


318
0:16:6,3 --> 0:16:8,1
What we don't need
at this time


319
0:16:8,1 --> 0:16:10,5
Is intelligent design
in the classrooms.


320
0:16:10,5 --> 0:16:12,9
To present
intelligent design


321
0:16:12,9 --> 0:16:15,2
Stunts their
educational growth.


322
0:16:15,2 --> 0:16:17,6
It stunts their
intellectual growth.


323
0:16:17,6 --> 0:16:19,0
But what I don't understand


324
0:16:19,0 --> 0:16:20,7
Is how these animals
could've been on earth


325
0:16:20,7 --> 0:16:22,1
Millions of years
before man


326
0:16:22,1 --> 0:16:25,8
When the bible says
the whole earth was created
in only six days.


327
0:16:25,8 --> 0:16:29,3
It wasn't just
the educational aspects
of intelligent design


328
0:16:29,3 --> 0:16:31,2
That had scientists
concerned.


329
0:16:31,2 --> 0:16:35,1
Many suspected the movement
masked a much larger agenda.


330
0:16:35,1 --> 0:16:38,5
Intelligent design
is a set of excuses


331
0:16:38,5 --> 0:16:40,9
To squeeze creationism
into the classrooms.


332
0:16:40,9 --> 0:16:43,8
Get intelligent design
in the schools today,


333
0:16:43,8 --> 0:16:46,3
And we can have
school prayers tomorrow.


334
0:16:46,3 --> 0:16:48,1
Chorus:
 hallelujah 


335
0:16:48,1 --> 0:16:49,6
 hallelujah 


336
0:16:49,6 --> 0:16:51,5
Stein: any other complaints?


337
0:16:51,5 --> 0:16:56,0
Can you imagine
anything more boring?


338
0:16:56,0 --> 0:17:0,9
The boredom attached
to id is supreme.


339
0:17:0,9 --> 0:17:2,5
It is so boring


340
0:17:2,5 --> 0:17:6,0
That I can't even bother
to think about it
much any more.


341
0:17:6,0 --> 0:17:10,2
It's just utterly boring.


342
0:17:10,2 --> 0:17:12,3
John paul young:
 love is in the air 


343
0:17:12,3 --> 0:17:17,7
 everywhere I look around 


344
0:17:17,7 --> 0:17:19,8
 love is in the air 


345
0:17:19,8 --> 0:17:25,2
 every sight
and every sound 


346
0:17:25,2 --> 0:17:27,1
Stein: love was
in the air, all right,


347
0:17:27,1 --> 0:17:30,6
But none of it was directed
toward intelligent design.


348
0:17:30,6 --> 0:17:32,6
There seemed to be
a lot to hate about id,


349
0:17:32,6 --> 0:17:36,9
And nearly all of that hatred
was focused on one place.


350
0:17:36,9 --> 0:17:40,0
The people in the--
from the discovery institute--


351
0:17:40,0 --> 0:17:42,4
The people who are doing
the intelligent design--


352
0:17:42,4 --> 0:17:45,8
They're all varnish
and no product.


353
0:17:45,8 --> 0:17:48,0
The discovery institute
is a propaganda mill.


354
0:17:48,0 --> 0:17:50,0
It's a--
it's an institution


355
0:17:50,0 --> 0:17:53,7
Designed to suck in money
from religious investors


356
0:17:53,7 --> 0:17:58,0
And turn it into a sanitized,
somewhat secular version


357
0:17:58,0 --> 0:18:0,9
Of the creation story
to get it into the schools.


358
0:18:0,9 --> 0:18:4,3
If they have a way
of understanding nature


359
0:18:4,3 --> 0:18:7,0
That's superior
to the one that we all


360
0:18:7,0 --> 0:18:9,6
Are making lots of
discoveries using, great.


361
0:18:9,6 --> 0:18:11,7
- bring it on.
- [rings]


362
0:18:11,7 --> 0:18:18,6
[norman greenbaum's
"spirit in the sky" plays]


363
0:18:18,6 --> 0:18:20,6
We are really,
really lost.


364
0:18:20,6 --> 0:18:23,3
I think it's on third.


365
0:18:23,3 --> 0:18:26,0
I think it's on third.
I think it's down there.


366
0:18:26,0 --> 0:18:33,0
I have no idea
where this place is.


367
0:18:33,0 --> 0:18:35,1
I guess I just
keep walking.


368
0:18:35,1 --> 0:18:38,8
Do you have any idea where
the discovery institute is?


369
0:18:38,8 --> 0:18:40,1
Have you ever heard
of that?


370
0:18:40,1 --> 0:18:42,4
- never heard of it.
- stein: okay, thank you.


371
0:18:42,4 --> 0:18:44,3
- man: hey, ben.
- how are you, sir?


372
0:18:44,3 --> 0:18:46,0
- man: i'm good. Yourself?
- good.


373
0:18:46,0 --> 0:18:49,0
Do you have any idea where
the discovery institute is?


374
0:18:49,0 --> 0:18:51,6
- not a clue.
- discovery institute?


375
0:18:51,6 --> 0:18:53,9
- thank you, it's very kind
of you to offer--
- welcome to seattle.


376
0:18:53,9 --> 0:18:56,9
Thank you, sir.


377
0:18:56,9 --> 0:19:1,0
It's gotta be
this whole building.


378
0:19:1,0 --> 0:19:3,3
Yes, where is
the discovery institute,
please?


379
0:19:3,3 --> 0:19:5,8
Discovery institute--
on the eighth floor,
suite 808.


380
0:19:5,8 --> 0:19:7,4
 when I die
and they lay me to rest 


381
0:19:7,4 --> 0:19:10,7
 gonna go to the place
that's the best 


382
0:19:10,7 --> 0:19:12,0
Okay, very good.


383
0:19:12,0 --> 0:19:13,9
 when I lay me
down to die 


384
0:19:13,9 --> 0:19:15,2
 goin' up
to the spirit in the sky 


385
0:19:15,2 --> 0:19:18,5
Aha, success at last.


386
0:19:18,5 --> 0:19:20,7
 goin' up
to the spirit in the sky 


387
0:19:20,7 --> 0:19:24,2
Aha, we found you.


388
0:19:24,2 --> 0:19:25,7
Are you bruce chapman?


389
0:19:25,7 --> 0:19:27,1
- I am.
- how are you?
I'm ben stein.


390
0:19:27,1 --> 0:19:28,7
- welcome.
- kind of you to have me here.


391
0:19:28,7 --> 0:19:30,5
Delighted to meet you.


392
0:19:30,5 --> 0:19:31,9
Can I look around
and see your offices?


393
0:19:31,9 --> 0:19:33,5
Absolutely.


394
0:19:33,5 --> 0:19:35,3
Do you just have
this floor,


395
0:19:35,3 --> 0:19:37,4
Or do you have several
other floors as well?


396
0:19:37,4 --> 0:19:39,5
- chapman:
no, this is it.
- this is it?


397
0:19:39,5 --> 0:19:41,0
You've made
an awful lot of trouble


398
0:19:41,0 --> 0:19:42,4
For being such
a small office.


399
0:19:42,4 --> 0:19:44,5
I thought it was going
to be like the pentagon.


400
0:19:44,5 --> 0:19:47,7
We're like
the little boy that said
the emperor has no clothes.


401
0:19:47,7 --> 0:19:50,2
And he didn't have
a big organization either.


402
0:19:50,2 --> 0:19:52,5
When you go around
and raise funds,


403
0:19:52,5 --> 0:19:54,8
Your people are
not saying to them,


404
0:19:54,8 --> 0:19:56,6
"by the way,
we're going to get


405
0:19:56,6 --> 0:19:58,9
"all these scientists
out of the classroom


406
0:19:58,9 --> 0:20:1,1
And put Christ back
in the classroom?"


407
0:20:1,1 --> 0:20:2,8
Well, I don't know
that Christ


408
0:20:2,8 --> 0:20:4,7
Has ever been
in the science classroom.


409
0:20:4,7 --> 0:20:6,6
This is not
a religious argument.


410
0:20:6,6 --> 0:20:8,0
This is something
that people--


411
0:20:8,0 --> 0:20:11,2
We have fellows
who are jewish
or agnostic


412
0:20:11,2 --> 0:20:12,9
Or various other things.


413
0:20:12,9 --> 0:20:16,2
There are--there are
moslem scientists.


414
0:20:16,2 --> 0:20:18,3
There are people
of all kinds of backgrounds


415
0:20:18,3 --> 0:20:20,1
Who agree
that darwin's theory
has failed.


416
0:20:20,1 --> 0:20:22,0
So why would you bring
religion into it?


417
0:20:22,0 --> 0:20:25,1
You don't need religion.
This is a red herring, ben.


418
0:20:25,1 --> 0:20:26,8
People who don't have
an argument


419
0:20:26,8 --> 0:20:29,6
Are reduced to throwing
sand in your eyes.


420
0:20:29,6 --> 0:20:31,1
If the discovery institute


421
0:20:31,1 --> 0:20:33,6
Could get its wish
about this subject,


422
0:20:33,6 --> 0:20:35,0
What would your wish be?


423
0:20:35,0 --> 0:20:37,1
Well, on this subject,
as on others,


424
0:20:37,1 --> 0:20:39,2
We'd like people
to be able to have


425
0:20:39,2 --> 0:20:41,9
A robust dialogue
and even a debate


426
0:20:41,9 --> 0:20:43,9
Where the best evidence--


427
0:20:43,9 --> 0:20:46,3
In this case
the best scientific evidence--


428
0:20:46,3 --> 0:20:48,1
Is made available to people.


429
0:20:48,1 --> 0:20:50,7
Surely no one questions
there should be a debate.


430
0:20:50,7 --> 0:20:52,2
Oh, yes, they do.


431
0:20:52,2 --> 0:20:54,1
- they do?
- they say the debate
has been settled,


432
0:20:54,1 --> 0:20:56,9
- that the issue's settled.
- when was the debate settled?


433
0:20:56,9 --> 0:20:58,6
Ben, i'd like you to talk
to the scientists.


434
0:20:58,6 --> 0:21:0,5
You don't want to get
your science from me.


435
0:21:0,5 --> 0:21:3,7
Mr. Chapman claimed id had
nothing to do with religion,


436
0:21:3,7 --> 0:21:7,2
So why was my first stop
biola university,


437
0:21:7,2 --> 0:21:11,8
Formerly known
as the bible institute
of los angeles?


438
0:21:11,8 --> 0:21:15,0
[johnny cash's
"personal Jesus" plays]


439
0:21:15,0 --> 0:21:23,4
 your own personal Jesus 


440
0:21:23,4 --> 0:21:26,2
 someone to hear
your prayers 


441
0:21:26,2 --> 0:21:28,0
 someone who cares 


442
0:21:28,0 --> 0:21:30,7
Nelson: string theory
will be a footnote
in the history of science.


443
0:21:30,7 --> 0:21:33,7
The inference that
stonehenge was caused
by intelligence...


444
0:21:33,7 --> 0:21:39,5
 your own
personal Jesus 


445
0:21:39,5 --> 0:21:41,5
 someone to hear
your prayers 


446
0:21:41,5 --> 0:21:52,9
 someone who's there 


447
0:21:52,9 --> 0:21:56,8
Stein: how much money
have you ever gotten
from jerry falwell?


448
0:21:56,8 --> 0:21:58,4
Uh, zero dollars.


449
0:21:58,4 --> 0:21:59,7
How about
pat robertson?


450
0:21:59,7 --> 0:22:1,0
Zero.


451
0:22:1,0 --> 0:22:1,9
Are you a minister?


452
0:22:1,9 --> 0:22:3,1
No.


453
0:22:3,1 --> 0:22:4,7
- are you a priest?
- no.


454
0:22:4,7 --> 0:22:5,7
- pastor?
- no.


455
0:22:5,7 --> 0:22:7,4
- youth pastor?
- no.


456
0:22:7,4 --> 0:22:8,9
I did teach
Sunday school once.


457
0:22:8,9 --> 0:22:10,7
Hasn't this all
been resolved?


458
0:22:10,7 --> 0:22:12,4
Aren't we all
darwinists now,


459
0:22:12,4 --> 0:22:14,9
Except for a few
cranks like you?


460
0:22:14,9 --> 0:22:17,8
Well, it's a funny thing
that questions


461
0:22:17,8 --> 0:22:21,6
That aren't properly answered
don't go away.


462
0:22:21,6 --> 0:22:25,7
This question
is loaded with all kinds
of political baggage,


463
0:22:25,7 --> 0:22:27,9
But one-on-one
at a scientific meeting


464
0:22:27,9 --> 0:22:29,6
After the third
or fourth beer,


465
0:22:29,6 --> 0:22:31,2
My experience has been


466
0:22:31,2 --> 0:22:32,9
That many
evolutionary biologists


467
0:22:32,9 --> 0:22:35,6
Will say, "yeah,
this theory's got
a lot of problems."


468
0:22:35,6 --> 0:22:36,9
So you mean to tell me


469
0:22:36,9 --> 0:22:39,5
That there really is
a debate among scientists


470
0:22:39,5 --> 0:22:41,8
About whether or not
evolution occurred?


471
0:22:41,8 --> 0:22:44,1
Well, "evolution"
is a kind of funny word.


472
0:22:44,1 --> 0:22:46,2
It depends
on how one defines it.


473
0:22:46,2 --> 0:22:49,7
If it means simply
change over time,


474
0:22:49,7 --> 0:22:52,7
Even the most rock-ribbed
fundamentalist


475
0:22:52,7 --> 0:22:55,5
Knows that the history
of the earth has changed--


476
0:22:55,5 --> 0:22:57,6
That there's been
change over time.


477
0:22:57,6 --> 0:22:59,7
If you define evolution
precisely, though,


478
0:22:59,7 --> 0:23:2,4
To mean the common descent
of all life on earth


479
0:23:2,4 --> 0:23:4,4
From a single ancestor


480
0:23:4,4 --> 0:23:7,2
Via undirected mutation
and natural selection--


481
0:23:7,2 --> 0:23:10,1
That's textbook definition
of neo-darwinism--


482
0:23:10,1 --> 0:23:13,2
Biologists of the first rank
have real questions.


483
0:23:13,2 --> 0:23:16,1
But the modern theory
of intelligent design


484
0:23:16,1 --> 0:23:19,3
Is just microwaved
creationism.


485
0:23:19,3 --> 0:23:21,1
I don't think
that's the case.


486
0:23:21,1 --> 0:23:23,1
Creationism,
properly understood,


487
0:23:23,1 --> 0:23:24,8
Begins with the bible
and says,


488
0:23:24,8 --> 0:23:29,0
"how can I fit the bible
into the data of science?"


489
0:23:29,0 --> 0:23:31,2
Intelligent design
doesn't do that.


490
0:23:31,2 --> 0:23:34,8
Intelligent design
is the study
of patterns in nature


491
0:23:34,8 --> 0:23:38,1
That are best explained
as a result of intelligence.


492
0:23:38,1 --> 0:23:40,7
So intelligent designers
believe that God
is the designer.


493
0:23:40,7 --> 0:23:42,9
Not necessarily.


494
0:23:42,9 --> 0:23:45,3
Intelligent design
is a minimal commitment,


495
0:23:45,3 --> 0:23:47,5
Scientifically,
to the possibility


496
0:23:47,5 --> 0:23:49,9
Of detecting
intelligent causation.


497
0:23:49,9 --> 0:23:53,3
Dr. Nelson didn't
sound like a crazy person,


498
0:23:53,3 --> 0:23:57,2
But I still suspected
id was nothing but
reheated creationism.


499
0:23:57,2 --> 0:23:59,0
My next stop
didn't seem like


500
0:23:59,0 --> 0:24:1,5
It was going
to alleviate those fears.


501
0:24:1,5 --> 0:24:3,8
Male country singer:
 didn't crawl
out of the ocean 


502
0:24:3,8 --> 0:24:6,5
 I didn't come
from no monkey 


503
0:24:6,5 --> 0:24:8,8
 but science tends
to forget 


504
0:24:8,8 --> 0:24:11,4
 evolution's just a theory 


505
0:24:11,4 --> 0:24:13,6
 they present it
in the textbooks 


506
0:24:13,6 --> 0:24:15,4
 and on animal tv 


507
0:24:15,4 --> 0:24:16,9
 like it's fact 


508
0:24:16,9 --> 0:24:18,8
 but tell me
were you there 


509
0:24:18,8 --> 0:24:25,0
 12 million b.C.? 


510
0:24:25,0 --> 0:24:28,3
Evolution is a--
from an intelligent design
perspective,


511
0:24:28,3 --> 0:24:31,0
Is perfectly acceptable
if the sense is that


512
0:24:31,0 --> 0:24:32,9
"how did the design
get implemented?"


513
0:24:32,9 --> 0:24:36,3
The issue is, is there
a real design there


514
0:24:36,3 --> 0:24:38,6
And are these
material mechanisms,


515
0:24:38,6 --> 0:24:40,0
Like natural selection,


516
0:24:40,0 --> 0:24:42,1
Are these adequate
to account for everything


517
0:24:42,1 --> 0:24:44,5
We see in biology?


518
0:24:44,5 --> 0:24:46,5
And our argument
is no, it's not.


519
0:24:46,5 --> 0:24:48,5
But darwin produced
all this evidence


520
0:24:48,5 --> 0:24:51,1
From his travels
and his studies
at the galapagos


521
0:24:51,1 --> 0:24:52,8
That evolution
explained things.


522
0:24:52,8 --> 0:24:54,5
If you look
at the history of science,


523
0:24:54,5 --> 0:24:56,1
People often have
a good idea,


524
0:24:56,1 --> 0:24:57,7
And then they decide
just to run with it.


525
0:24:57,7 --> 0:24:59,9
And they say, "we're going
to apply this everywhere."


526
0:24:59,9 --> 0:25:1,8
So darwin takes his idea
of natural selection


527
0:25:1,8 --> 0:25:4,0
And says,
"i'm going to explain
all of life with it.


528
0:25:4,0 --> 0:25:7,0
Physics used to be
newtonian physics.


529
0:25:7,0 --> 0:25:8,5
Newton was physics.


530
0:25:8,5 --> 0:25:11,1
And then you gotta
look to einstein,
general relativity.


531
0:25:11,1 --> 0:25:12,6
It's not newton is enough.


532
0:25:12,6 --> 0:25:14,6
I think, likewise,
what we're finding with darwin


533
0:25:14,6 --> 0:25:16,6
Is that he had
some valid insights,


534
0:25:16,6 --> 0:25:18,4
But it's not
the whole picture.


535
0:25:18,4 --> 0:25:22,1
Okay, darwinism may not be
the complete picture,


536
0:25:22,1 --> 0:25:23,9
But what made
these guys think


537
0:25:23,9 --> 0:25:25,8
They had
the missing pieces?


538
0:25:25,8 --> 0:25:28,0
I put this question
to dr. Stephen meyer,


539
0:25:28,0 --> 0:25:30,2
Author of the paper
that originally got


540
0:25:30,2 --> 0:25:32,3
Dr. Sternberg
in so much trouble.


541
0:25:32,3 --> 0:25:34,8
Stein: it's hard to believe
that this little town


542
0:25:34,8 --> 0:25:37,5
Is the headquarters
of giant microsoft,


543
0:25:37,5 --> 0:25:41,2
Which enabled mr. Gates
to become fantastically rich.


544
0:25:41,2 --> 0:25:43,6
Maybe that's what
steve meyer's doing here.


545
0:25:43,6 --> 0:25:47,8
Maybe this is somehow
going to make him
fantastically rich.


546
0:25:47,8 --> 0:25:50,0
We'll pin him down


547
0:25:50,0 --> 0:25:55,6
Like a butterfly
on a butterfly board--


548
0:25:55,6 --> 0:25:59,0
A butterfly
on a killing board.


549
0:25:59,0 --> 0:26:1,4
Coffee shop
straight ahead.


550
0:26:1,4 --> 0:26:5,3
Stein: newton is buried
in the genius's corner


551
0:26:5,3 --> 0:26:7,1
At westminster abbey,
right?


552
0:26:7,1 --> 0:26:8,7
That's correct, yeah.


553
0:26:8,7 --> 0:26:11,1
Darwin is also buried
in westminster abbey.


554
0:26:11,1 --> 0:26:12,4
Right. And so is darwin.


555
0:26:12,4 --> 0:26:14,0
- right, right.
- right near each other.


556
0:26:14,0 --> 0:26:16,0
And you're here in redmond


557
0:26:16,0 --> 0:26:18,5
In a little building
without a sign, right?


558
0:26:18,5 --> 0:26:19,7
[laughs]


559
0:26:19,7 --> 0:26:22,3
And you're obviously
an incredibly smart guy,


560
0:26:22,3 --> 0:26:23,9
But how dare you challenge


561
0:26:23,9 --> 0:26:26,7
Someone who's buried
in the genius's corner


562
0:26:26,7 --> 0:26:29,2
Next to newton
at westminster abbey.


563
0:26:29,2 --> 0:26:31,5
Well, it may seem
a little cheeky,


564
0:26:31,5 --> 0:26:33,5
But it's what scientists
are supposed to do.


565
0:26:33,5 --> 0:26:34,9
When I was in cambridge,


566
0:26:34,9 --> 0:26:37,7
One of my supervisors
often advised us


567
0:26:37,7 --> 0:26:41,1
To beware the sound
of one hand clapping,


568
0:26:41,1 --> 0:26:44,0
Which was a way of saying
if there's an argument
on one side,


569
0:26:44,0 --> 0:26:46,2
There's bound to be
an argument on the other.


570
0:26:46,2 --> 0:26:48,5
What I found in studying
the structure


571
0:26:48,5 --> 0:26:51,0
Of the argument
in the origin of species


572
0:26:51,0 --> 0:26:53,4
Is that for every
evidence-based argument


573
0:26:53,4 --> 0:26:56,2
For one of darwin's
two key propositions,


574
0:26:56,2 --> 0:26:58,1
There is an evidence-based
counterargument.


575
0:26:58,1 --> 0:26:59,7
Well, but--is it a debate?


576
0:26:59,7 --> 0:27:1,8
There's just you
and a couple of other guys


577
0:27:1,8 --> 0:27:5,4
In a dinky little office
downtown, say, on one side,


578
0:27:5,4 --> 0:27:7,1
And there's
the faculties of all


579
0:27:7,1 --> 0:27:9,4
The great universities
in the world
on the other side.


580
0:27:9,4 --> 0:27:11,8
Speaking with a great, uniform,
and authoritative voice.


581
0:27:11,8 --> 0:27:12,8
Yes, right.


582
0:27:12,8 --> 0:27:14,1
Well, in any case,
the debate


583
0:27:14,1 --> 0:27:16,4
Really isn't going to be
settled by numbers.


584
0:27:16,4 --> 0:27:19,4
It's going to be settled
by the evidence
and the arguments.


585
0:27:19,4 --> 0:27:21,7
While I was still
in bill gates country,


586
0:27:21,7 --> 0:27:23,5
Dr. Meyer
recommended I check in


587
0:27:23,5 --> 0:27:28,0
With molecular biologist
jonathan wells.


588
0:27:28,0 --> 0:27:29,9
What kind of names
do they call you?


589
0:27:29,9 --> 0:27:32,5
- uh, creationist.
- what do you say
back to them


590
0:27:32,5 --> 0:27:34,6
When they say you're
a creationist?


591
0:27:34,6 --> 0:27:37,1
Well, I usually don't
get the opportunity.


592
0:27:37,1 --> 0:27:39,0
What's at stake
for you, personally?


593
0:27:39,0 --> 0:27:40,5
First of all,
I love science.


594
0:27:40,5 --> 0:27:42,5
I think
the way darwinism


595
0:27:42,5 --> 0:27:45,5
Corrupts the evidence,
distorts the evidence,


596
0:27:45,5 --> 0:27:46,7
Is bad for science.


597
0:27:46,7 --> 0:27:48,8
Well, the other scientists
will tell you


598
0:27:48,8 --> 0:27:51,1
To just shut up
if you love science, okay?


599
0:27:51,1 --> 0:27:55,0
Because you're sort of being
a bomb thrower into science.


600
0:27:55,0 --> 0:27:56,6
I am upsetting
the applecart.


601
0:27:56,6 --> 0:27:59,5
I think it deserves
to be upset in this case.


602
0:27:59,5 --> 0:28:0,5
Why?


603
0:28:0,5 --> 0:28:2,6
Because the evidence
is being distorted


604
0:28:2,6 --> 0:28:5,3
To prop up a theory that
I think doesn't fit it.


605
0:28:5,3 --> 0:28:8,3
Was darwinism
really that bad?


606
0:28:8,3 --> 0:28:9,9
Perhaps a change of scenery


607
0:28:9,9 --> 0:28:12,3
Would give me
a fresh perspective.


608

0:28:38,5 --> 0:28:40,5
Mr. Berlinski,
I assume?


610
0:28:40,5 --> 0:28:42,9
- ben stein,
what a pleasure to meet you.
- how are you, sir?


611
0:28:42,9 --> 0:28:45,3
So, where are you
from originally?


612
0:28:45,3 --> 0:28:48,7
I was born in new york,
spent 31 years in manhattan.


613
0:28:48,7 --> 0:28:52,0
- yes.
- and I spent a lot of time
in california, too.


614
0:28:52,0 --> 0:28:54,1
And tell me
all the various universities


615
0:28:54,1 --> 0:28:55,6
Where you've studied
or taught.


616
0:28:55,6 --> 0:28:59,9
I was at princeton,
then I had a professorship
at stanford.


617
0:28:59,9 --> 0:29:2,2
Then I left stanford,
and I taught at rutgers.


618
0:29:2,2 --> 0:29:3,6
I left rutgers,
and I taught


619
0:29:3,6 --> 0:29:5,3
At the city college
in new york.


620
0:29:5,3 --> 0:29:6,7
I left the city college
of new york.


621
0:29:6,7 --> 0:29:9,1
I taught at the baruch college,
I taught at san jose--


622
0:29:9,1 --> 0:29:10,8
What did you teach
at baruch college?


623
0:29:10,8 --> 0:29:12,3
Anything they wanted.
Come on in.


624
0:29:12,3 --> 0:29:15,5
Thank you, monsieur.


625
0:29:15,5 --> 0:29:17,9
What an old building! Wow.


626
0:29:17,9 --> 0:29:19,3
It's the oldest in paris.


627
0:29:19,3 --> 0:29:20,9
You're kidding.


628
0:29:20,9 --> 0:29:22,1
Merci, monsieur.


629
0:29:22,1 --> 0:29:26,3
- ah, je vous en prie, monsieur.
- merci.


630
0:29:26,3 --> 0:29:28,7
Stein: wow,
this is fabulous.


631
0:29:28,7 --> 0:29:30,7
Berlinski:
let's put it this way.


632
0:29:30,7 --> 0:29:34,3
Before you can ask
is darwinian theory
correct or not,


633
0:29:34,3 --> 0:29:36,6
You have to ask
the preliminary question


634
0:29:36,6 --> 0:29:39,6
"is it clear enough
so that it could be correct?"


635
0:29:39,6 --> 0:29:41,3
That's a very
different question.


636
0:29:41,3 --> 0:29:44,7
One of my prevailing doctrines
about darwinian theory


637
0:29:44,7 --> 0:29:46,7
Is, man, that thing
is just a mess.


638
0:29:46,7 --> 0:29:50,0
It's like looking into
a room full of smoke.


639
0:29:50,0 --> 0:29:51,6
Nothing in the theory


640
0:29:51,6 --> 0:29:55,3
Is precisely, clearly,
carefully defined
or delineated.


641
0:29:55,3 --> 0:29:56,7
It lacks all of the rigor


642
0:29:56,7 --> 0:29:58,6
One expects from
mathematical physics,


643
0:29:58,6 --> 0:30:0,6
And mathematical physics
lacks all the rigor


644
0:30:0,6 --> 0:30:1,9
One expects
from mathematics.


645
0:30:1,9 --> 0:30:4,1
So we're talking about
a gradual descent


646
0:30:4,1 --> 0:30:5,6
Down the level
of intelligibility


647
0:30:5,6 --> 0:30:7,6
Until we reach
evolutionary biology.


648
0:30:7,6 --> 0:30:11,0
We don't even know
what a species is,
for heaven's sakes.


649
0:30:11,0 --> 0:30:15,2
So his theory is smoke,
but elegant smoke.


650
0:30:15,2 --> 0:30:17,2
There's a certain
elegance to it,


651
0:30:17,2 --> 0:30:19,3
But I think einstein had
the appropriate remark:


652
0:30:19,3 --> 0:30:21,6
He preferred to leave
elegance to his tailor.


653
0:30:21,6 --> 0:30:23,2
A room full of smoke?


654
0:30:23,2 --> 0:30:25,1
That certainly wasn't
what I was hearing


655
0:30:25,1 --> 0:30:28,0
From prominent darwinists
like richard dawkins.


656
0:30:28,0 --> 0:30:29,2
Evolution is a fact.


657
0:30:29,2 --> 0:30:32,3
It's a fact which is
established as securely


658
0:30:32,3 --> 0:30:35,7
As essentially any other fact
that we have in science.


659
0:30:35,7 --> 0:30:37,9
Richard dawkins
is so confident


660
0:30:37,9 --> 0:30:39,3
That evolution is a fact


661
0:30:39,3 --> 0:30:41,7
And that therefore
God doesn't exist


662
0:30:41,7 --> 0:30:43,8
That he has devoted
his entire life


663
0:30:43,8 --> 0:30:46,0
To spreading
the evolution gospel.


664
0:30:46,0 --> 0:30:48,8
I'm an atheist with respect
to the judeo-Christian God


665
0:30:48,8 --> 0:30:51,3
Because there is not
a shred of evidence


666
0:30:51,3 --> 0:30:54,4
In favor
of the judeo-Christian God.


667
0:30:54,4 --> 0:30:55,8
It is completely
right to say


668
0:30:55,8 --> 0:30:57,5
That since the evidence
for evolution


669
0:30:57,5 --> 0:31:0,0
Is so absolutely,
totally overwhelming--


670
0:31:0,0 --> 0:31:2,7
Nobody who looks at it
could possibly doubt that


671
0:31:2,7 --> 0:31:5,4
If they were sane
and not stupid--


672
0:31:5,4 --> 0:31:8,3
So the only remaining
possibility is that
they're ignorant,


673
0:31:8,3 --> 0:31:11,8
And most people who
don't believe in evolution
are indeed ignorant.


674
0:31:11,8 --> 0:31:14,5
But the people I spoke with
weren't ignorant.


675
0:31:14,5 --> 0:31:17,0
They were
highly credentialed scientists.


676
0:31:17,0 --> 0:31:20,2
So there had to be
something else going on here.


677
0:31:20,2 --> 0:31:24,8
So you think the whole theory
of evolution is false


678
0:31:24,8 --> 0:31:26,5
Or just certain parts of it?


679
0:31:26,5 --> 0:31:29,0
Well, again, "evolution"
is a slippery word.


680
0:31:29,0 --> 0:31:32,9
I would say minor changes
within species happen.


681
0:31:32,9 --> 0:31:34,9
But darwin didn't write
a book called


682
0:31:34,9 --> 0:31:38,5
How existing species
change over time.


683
0:31:38,5 --> 0:31:41,7
He wrote a book called
the origin of species.


684
0:31:41,7 --> 0:31:45,2
- he purported to show
how this same process--
- huh, I see.


685
0:31:45,2 --> 0:31:49,1
...Leads to new species--
in fact, every species--


686
0:31:49,1 --> 0:31:51,4
And the evidence
for that grand claim


687
0:31:51,4 --> 0:31:53,9
Is, in my opinion,
almost totally lacking.


688
0:31:53,9 --> 0:31:58,5
How does darwin--
or darwinism--say life began?


689
0:31:58,5 --> 0:32:1,1
Well, he didn't know.
And, in fact, nobody knows.


690
0:32:1,1 --> 0:32:4,0
So darwinism,
strictly defined,


691
0:32:4,0 --> 0:32:6,1
Starts after
the origin of life


692
0:32:6,1 --> 0:32:8,2
And deals only
with living things.


693
0:32:8,2 --> 0:32:11,8
How can there be
a theory about life


694
0:32:11,8 --> 0:32:14,8
Without a theory
about how life began?


695
0:32:14,8 --> 0:32:18,8
Well, a grand, overarching
evolutionary story,


696
0:32:18,8 --> 0:32:21,1
Of course, does include
the origin of life.


697
0:32:21,1 --> 0:32:22,9
Darwin's theory
doesn't begin


698
0:32:22,9 --> 0:32:24,6
Until you have
the first cell.


699
0:32:24,6 --> 0:32:27,2
Does someone have a theory
about how life began?


700
0:32:27,2 --> 0:32:34,3
[explosion]


701
0:32:34,3 --> 0:32:37,6
Man: this is the story
of a small planet in space


702
0:32:37,6 --> 0:32:39,1
Called earth.


703
0:32:39,1 --> 0:32:41,4
Stein: for a typical
darwinian explanation


704
0:32:41,4 --> 0:32:42,9
Of how life originated,


705
0:32:42,9 --> 0:32:46,7
Dr. Wells directed me
toward this documentary.


706
0:32:46,7 --> 0:32:49,1
Man: the chemical elements
essential for life--


707
0:32:49,1 --> 0:32:52,5
Hydrogen, oxygen,
carbon, and nitrogen--


708
0:32:52,5 --> 0:32:54,7
Were now in place.


709
0:32:54,7 --> 0:32:59,7
What was needed was
a way of combining them.


710
0:32:59,7 --> 0:33:3,3
Perhaps the energy
came from lightning.


711
0:33:3,3 --> 0:33:5,3
- whatever it was--
- [film pauses]


712
0:33:5,3 --> 0:33:7,0
Stein: excuse me?


713
0:33:7,0 --> 0:33:9,0
- [film resumes]
- man: whatever it was,


714
0:33:9,0 --> 0:33:11,5
Energy managed to arrange
these chemical ingredients


715
0:33:11,5 --> 0:33:13,6
In just the right way.


716
0:33:13,6 --> 0:33:15,4
Stein: "whatever it was"?


717
0:33:15,4 --> 0:33:18,8
I was hoping for something
a little more scientific.


718
0:33:18,8 --> 0:33:21,1
The most popular idea


719
0:33:21,1 --> 0:33:23,5
Has been that life
emerged spontaneously


720
0:33:23,5 --> 0:33:25,2
From primordial soup.


721
0:33:25,2 --> 0:33:27,4
In 1953, stanley miller


722
0:33:27,4 --> 0:33:31,3
Mixed water, methane,
ammonia, and hydrogen


723
0:33:31,3 --> 0:33:33,5
To simulate
the early earth's atmosphere.


724
0:33:33,5 --> 0:33:35,7
Then he ran electricity
through it


725
0:33:35,7 --> 0:33:38,3
In an attempt
to jump-start life.


726
0:33:38,3 --> 0:33:39,7
It's alive!
It's alive!


727
0:33:39,7 --> 0:33:41,6
It's alive!


728
0:33:41,6 --> 0:33:43,6
It didn't work.


729
0:33:43,6 --> 0:33:46,0
While the initial results
seemed promising,


730
0:33:46,0 --> 0:33:48,3
50 years later
most serious scientists


731
0:33:48,3 --> 0:33:50,1
Have abandoned this approach


732
0:33:50,1 --> 0:33:52,1
In favor
of alternate theories.


733
0:33:52,1 --> 0:33:54,3
Prominent darwinist
michael ruse


734
0:33:54,3 --> 0:33:56,9
Attempted to explain
one of them to me.


735
0:33:56,9 --> 0:33:58,8
He wasn't kidding.


736
0:33:58,8 --> 0:34:1,9
How did we get
from an inorganic world


737
0:34:1,9 --> 0:34:4,1
To the world of the cell?


738
0:34:4,1 --> 0:34:6,5
Well, one popular
theory is that it


739
0:34:6,5 --> 0:34:10,2
Might have started off
on the backs of crystals.


740
0:34:10,2 --> 0:34:12,9
My crystal ball.


741
0:34:12,9 --> 0:34:16,8
Molecules piggybacked
on the back of crystals forming,


742
0:34:16,8 --> 0:34:19,0
And that this led
to more and more complex--


743
0:34:19,0 --> 0:34:20,8
But of course the nice thing
about crystals


744
0:34:20,8 --> 0:34:24,2
Is that every now and then
you get mistakes--mutations--


745
0:34:24,2 --> 0:34:27,2
And that this opens the way
for natural selection.


746
0:34:27,2 --> 0:34:30,5
But--but at one point
there was not
a living thing,


747
0:34:30,5 --> 0:34:32,2
And then there was
a living thing.


748
0:34:32,2 --> 0:34:33,4
How did that happen?


749
0:34:33,4 --> 0:34:35,1
Well, that's just a--
i've just told you.


750
0:34:35,1 --> 0:34:37,8
I don't see any reason
why you shouldn't go


751
0:34:37,8 --> 0:34:41,6
From very simple
to more and more complex
to more and more complex--


752
0:34:41,6 --> 0:34:42,6
I don't either.


753
0:34:42,6 --> 0:34:44,4
But I don't know
how you get from mud


754
0:34:44,4 --> 0:34:46,2
To a living cell.
That's my question.


755
0:34:46,2 --> 0:34:48,6
Yes, well, i've told you.
I'll try one more time.


756
0:34:48,6 --> 0:34:50,9
You think it was on
the backs of crystals.


757
0:34:50,9 --> 0:34:54,2
On the backs of crystals is
at least one hypothesis, yes.


758
0:34:54,2 --> 0:34:56,6
So that's your theory,
and you think that
is more likely


759
0:34:56,6 --> 0:34:58,9
And less far-fetched
than intelligent design.


760
0:34:58,9 --> 0:35:0,1
I think it is.


761
0:35:0,1 --> 0:35:2,9
I wouldn't put
ben stein's money


762
0:35:2,9 --> 0:35:4,9
On dr. Ruse's
joyriding crystals,


763
0:35:4,9 --> 0:35:6,5
But it did make me wonder


764
0:35:6,5 --> 0:35:9,1
What were the chances of life
arising on its own?


765
0:35:9,1 --> 0:35:11,4
Bradley: it's been
speculated that probably


766
0:35:11,4 --> 0:35:12,8
There would have to be


767
0:35:12,8 --> 0:35:15,0
A minimum of
about 250 proteins


768
0:35:15,0 --> 0:35:17,5
To provide
minimal life function.


769
0:35:17,5 --> 0:35:21,2
Um, if that's
really true,


770
0:35:21,2 --> 0:35:23,7
Then I think it's
almost inconceivable


771
0:35:23,7 --> 0:35:25,3
That life could've happened


772
0:35:25,3 --> 0:35:27,3
In some simple,
step-by-step way.


773
0:35:27,3 --> 0:35:30,1
Okay,
so the simplest form of life


774
0:35:30,1 --> 0:35:33,9
Requires at least
250 proteins to function.


775
0:35:33,9 --> 0:35:36,1
What's so difficult
about that?

Oh, sure.

Roughly one in a trillion,

Let all of life chose

A trillion trillion--


804
0:36:51,3 --> 0:36:52,9
The number is
essentially zero.


805
0:36:52,9 --> 0:36:56,8
Something has to skew nature
to chose the ones that work.

0:36:59,2 --> 0:37:1,6
It looks
as if the house always wins.


808
0:37:1,6 --> 0:37:4,9
Luckily, some serious
scientific minds


809
0:37:4,9 --> 0:37:7,6
Have figured out a way
to beat the odds.


810
0:37:7,6 --> 0:37:11,0
[man reads
in ominous voice]


811
0:37:11,0 --> 0:37:13,4
Stein: when faced with
the overwhelming problem


812
0:37:13,4 --> 0:37:14,6
Of the origin of life,


813
0:37:14,6 --> 0:37:16,8
Nobel prize-winner
francis crick


814
0:37:16,8 --> 0:37:18,5
Proposed this theory--


815
0:37:18,5 --> 0:37:20,9
That life
was "seeded" on earth,


816
0:37:20,9 --> 0:37:26,8
Which basically means
aliens did it.


817
0:37:26,8 --> 0:37:30,5
Crystals?
Aliens?


818
0:37:30,5 --> 0:37:32,9
I thought we were talking
about science,


819
0:37:32,9 --> 0:37:35,5
Not science fiction.


820
0:37:35,5 --> 0:37:38,4
We don't know what
caused life to arise.


821
0:37:38,4 --> 0:37:40,8
Did it arise by a purely
undirected process,


822
0:37:40,8 --> 0:37:42,4
Or did it arise
by some kind


823
0:37:42,4 --> 0:37:44,6
Of intelligent guidance
or design?


824
0:37:44,6 --> 0:37:46,2
And the rules of science


825
0:37:46,2 --> 0:37:48,7
Are being applied
to actually foreclose


826
0:37:48,7 --> 0:37:50,9
One of the two
possible answers


827
0:37:50,9 --> 0:37:53,4
To that very
fundamental and basic
and important question.


828
0:37:53,4 --> 0:37:55,2
So the rules
of science say


829
0:37:55,2 --> 0:37:57,1
We will consider
any possibility


830
0:37:57,1 --> 0:37:59,7
- except one that is guided.
- exactly.


831
0:37:59,7 --> 0:38:1,4
No matter
how life began,


832
0:38:1,4 --> 0:38:3,0
On the backs of crystals


833
0:38:3,0 --> 0:38:6,0
Or in the test tube
of some intelligent designer,


834
0:38:6,0 --> 0:38:9,0
Everyone agrees
it started with a single cell.


835
0:38:9,0 --> 0:38:10,7
But what is a cell?


836
0:38:10,7 --> 0:38:12,4
- let me ask you a question.
- yeah.


837
0:38:12,4 --> 0:38:16,2
Darwin wrote
the origin of species
in 1859--


838
0:38:16,2 --> 0:38:18,0
Published it in 1859.


839
0:38:18,0 --> 0:38:22,2
He had an idea of the cell
as being quite simple, correct?


840
0:38:22,2 --> 0:38:23,2
Yeah, everybody did.


841
0:38:23,2 --> 0:38:28,9
Okay, if he thought of
the cell as being a buick,


842
0:38:28,9 --> 0:38:30,4
What is the cell now


843
0:38:30,4 --> 0:38:32,4
In terms of its complexity
by comparison?


844
0:38:32,4 --> 0:38:33,6
A galaxy.


845
0:38:33,6 --> 0:38:36,6
If darwin thought a cell


846
0:38:36,6 --> 0:38:38,7
Was, say, a mud hut,


847
0:38:38,7 --> 0:38:41,4
What do we now know
that a cell is?


848
0:38:41,4 --> 0:38:45,2
More complicated
than a saturn v.


849
0:38:45,2 --> 0:38:48,3
So what is in a cell
as far as we know now?


850
0:38:48,3 --> 0:38:51,4
A world that darwin
never could've imagined.


851
0:38:51,4 --> 0:38:52,9
I needed someone who could


852
0:38:52,9 --> 0:38:54,4
Give me a glimpse
into this world,


853
0:38:54,4 --> 0:38:58,2
So we went to molecular
biologist doug axe.


854
0:38:58,2 --> 0:39:1,7
Axe: think of a cell
as being a nanofactory,


855
0:39:1,7 --> 0:39:5,6
A factory where,
on a very small scale,


856
0:39:5,6 --> 0:39:7,6
Digital instructions
are being used


857
0:39:7,6 --> 0:39:10,0
To make the components
of the factory.


858
0:39:10,0 --> 0:39:12,9
Here we have the famous
dna double helix.


859
0:39:12,9 --> 0:39:14,9
You can see
the two helical strands


860
0:39:14,9 --> 0:39:17,6
That are intertwined
and wind around each other


861
0:39:17,6 --> 0:39:19,6
On the outside
of the molecule.


862
0:39:19,6 --> 0:39:21,8
This is the material
that stores


863
0:39:21,8 --> 0:39:24,2
All of our genetic
information.


864
0:39:24,2 --> 0:39:27,1
In higher life forms,
this would be the equivalent


865
0:39:27,1 --> 0:39:29,6
Of something like
a gigabyte of information


866
0:39:29,6 --> 0:39:31,3
Stored in the molecules


867
0:39:31,3 --> 0:39:33,5
That form
the individual chromosomes,


868
0:39:33,5 --> 0:39:35,6
All packed
within the nucleus,


869
0:39:35,6 --> 0:39:39,0
Which is a tiny fraction
of the entire cell size.


870
0:39:39,0 --> 0:39:40,7
So what does dna do?


871
0:39:40,7 --> 0:39:42,9
Well, the information in dna


872
0:39:42,9 --> 0:39:44,9
Ends up providing
the information


873
0:39:44,9 --> 0:39:48,7
For sequencing the amino acids
to make protein.


874
0:39:48,7 --> 0:39:51,7
We have information
in a one-dimensional form


875
0:39:51,7 --> 0:40:9,6
That provides the information
for a three-dimensional form.


876
0:40:9,6 --> 0:40:14,0
[whooshes]


877
0:40:14,0 --> 0:40:49,5
[liquid gurgling]


878
0:40:49,5 --> 0:41:5,3
[fluttering]


879
0:41:5,3 --> 0:41:8,2
I'm finally
just beginning to grasp


880
0:41:8,2 --> 0:41:9,8
The complexity of the cell.


881
0:41:9,8 --> 0:41:11,6
Are there systems
within the cell


882
0:41:11,6 --> 0:41:14,3
That go well beyond
darwinian evolution,


883
0:41:14,3 --> 0:41:16,6
Some type
of cellular technology


884
0:41:16,6 --> 0:41:19,3
That drives
adaptation, replication,


885
0:41:19,3 --> 0:41:21,7
Quality control,
and repair?


886
0:41:21,7 --> 0:41:23,3
What if these new mechanisms


887
0:41:23,3 --> 0:41:25,9
Have massive design
implications?


888
0:41:25,9 --> 0:41:28,4
Well, I say so be it.


889
0:41:28,4 --> 0:41:32,2
The cell really is like
nothing we've ever seen
in the physical world.


890
0:41:32,2 --> 0:41:33,8
That's got to be
firmly grasped.


891
0:41:33,8 --> 0:41:35,6
That's not something
we can just say,


892
0:41:35,6 --> 0:41:39,0
"oh, well, it's just
a little bit more of
the same old, same old.


893
0:41:39,0 --> 0:41:40,9
It's not
the same old, same old.


894
0:41:40,9 --> 0:41:42,7
What we are finding
is that there's information


895
0:41:42,7 --> 0:41:45,3
That's in the cell
that cannot be accounted for


896
0:41:45,3 --> 0:41:48,0
In terms of these
undirected material causes,


897
0:41:48,0 --> 0:41:50,8
And so there's some other--


898
0:41:50,8 --> 0:41:53,4
So there has to be
an information source.


899
0:41:53,4 --> 0:41:57,5
So one of the key questions
faced by modern biology


900
0:41:57,5 --> 0:42:2,6
Is where do you get
information from?


901
0:42:2,6 --> 0:42:5,4
Well, darwin assumed


902
0:42:5,4 --> 0:42:7,8
That the increase
in information


903
0:42:7,8 --> 0:42:11,0
Comes from
natural selection.


904
0:42:11,0 --> 0:42:15,1
But natural selection
reduces genetic information,


905
0:42:15,1 --> 0:42:18,7
And we know this from
all the genetic manipulation
studies that we have.


906
0:42:18,7 --> 0:42:21,8
Where is the new genetic
information gonna come from?


907
0:42:21,8 --> 0:42:23,8
Well, that's
the big question.


908
0:42:23,8 --> 0:42:26,5
So when we find information
in the dna molecule,


909
0:42:26,5 --> 0:42:28,1
The most likely explanation


910
0:42:28,1 --> 0:42:30,5
Is that it, too,
had an intelligent source.


911
0:42:30,5 --> 0:42:32,2
We need engineering
principles


912
0:42:32,2 --> 0:42:34,5
To understand
these systems, okay?


913
0:42:34,5 --> 0:42:37,9
It's only because
of our advancements
in nanotechnology


914
0:42:37,9 --> 0:42:40,8
That we can even begin
to appreciate these systems.


915
0:42:40,8 --> 0:42:42,7
But using intelligent design


916
0:42:42,7 --> 0:42:45,3
Didn't seem to stop
the scientists I spoke with.


917
0:42:45,3 --> 0:42:47,8
So why all the controversy?


918
0:42:47,8 --> 0:42:51,0
Suppose we find,
simply as a matter of fact,


919
0:42:51,0 --> 0:42:54,1
That our scientific inquiries
point in one direction.


920
0:42:54,1 --> 0:42:55,9
Which is that there is
an intelligent creator.


921
0:42:55,9 --> 0:42:58,4
Why should we eliminate
that from discussion?


922
0:42:58,4 --> 0:43:0,3
Streng verboten?
How come? Why?


923
0:43:0,3 --> 0:43:2,4
Streng verboten.
Very good.


924
0:43:2,4 --> 0:43:4,7
What does streng verboten
mean, "strongly forbidden"?


925
0:43:4,7 --> 0:43:6,2
Strongly forbidden.


926
0:43:6,2 --> 0:43:7,6
You've got
two possible hypotheses.


927
0:43:7,6 --> 0:43:9,8
You've got a wall
through the middle--


928
0:43:9,8 --> 0:43:12,6
Through your brain, in effect--
through your thinking.


929
0:43:12,6 --> 0:43:15,7
You say, well,
you can't consider anything
on this side of the wall.


930
0:43:15,7 --> 0:43:17,8
Only hypotheses
on this side of the wall


931
0:43:17,8 --> 0:43:20,6
Are permissible
for consideration.


932
0:43:20,6 --> 0:43:22,7
What about
academic freedom?


933
0:43:22,7 --> 0:43:25,5
I mean, can't we
just talk about this?


934
0:43:25,5 --> 0:43:29,4
Their reply is that science
is not a democratic process.


935
0:43:29,4 --> 0:43:30,5
Oh, really?


936
0:43:30,5 --> 0:43:32,5
And that there is
a consensus view


937
0:43:32,5 --> 0:43:34,5
And that we are to subscribe
to the consensual view.


938
0:43:34,5 --> 0:43:37,5
Wait a second.
Darwin challenged
the consensus view,


939
0:43:37,5 --> 0:43:39,8
And that's how
we got darwinism.


940
0:43:39,8 --> 0:43:42,9
If darwin wanted to challenge
the consensus today,


941
0:43:42,9 --> 0:43:44,5
How would he do it?


942
0:43:44,5 --> 0:43:47,9
Science isn't a hobby
for rich aristocrats anymore.


943
0:43:47,9 --> 0:43:49,9
It's a multibillion-dollar
industry.


944
0:43:49,9 --> 0:43:52,0
And if you want
a piece of the pie,


945
0:43:52,0 --> 0:43:58,2
You've got to be
a "good comrade."


946
0:43:58,2 --> 0:44:0,2
Man: scientific ideas--


947
0:44:0,2 --> 0:44:3,9
How we get them
to you, the people.


948
0:44:3,9 --> 0:44:8,2
Every idea must be inspected
to ensure that it is safe.


949
0:44:8,2 --> 0:44:11,0
All theories must pass through
a series of checkpoints.


950
0:44:11,0 --> 0:44:13,6
First--the academy.


951
0:44:13,6 --> 0:44:15,8
Stein: getting
a controversial theory


952
0:44:15,8 --> 0:44:18,4
Through the academy
can be dangerous.


953
0:44:18,4 --> 0:44:21,7
Few people know this better
than congressman mark souder.


954
0:44:21,7 --> 0:44:24,7
He uncovered
a targeted campaign


955
0:44:24,7 --> 0:44:27,4
Led by individuals
within the smithsonian


956
0:44:27,4 --> 0:44:30,0
And the national center
for science education


957
0:44:30,0 --> 0:44:33,4
To destroy
dr. Sternberg's credibility.


958
0:44:33,4 --> 0:44:36,8
If you want peer reviews,
if you want to be published,


959
0:44:36,8 --> 0:44:39,4
If you want to go
to respected institutions,


960
0:44:39,4 --> 0:44:43,4
The core view does not
tolerate dissent.


961
0:44:43,4 --> 0:44:45,4
There's kind of
a "this is the way it is,"


962
0:44:45,4 --> 0:44:48,2
And anybody who's a dissenter
should be squashed.


963
0:44:48,2 --> 0:44:50,4
Are you going to be
on my side if I let you up?


964
0:44:50,4 --> 0:44:53,1
Sure, chick, sure.
I'm on your side.


965
0:44:53,1 --> 0:44:55,5
Just let me up.
I'll do anything you say.


966
0:44:55,5 --> 0:44:59,1
Souder isn't the only one
who has witnessed
the academy's tactics.


967
0:44:59,1 --> 0:45:0,9
Journalist larry witham


968
0:45:0,9 --> 0:45:3,8
Has seen similar behavior
during his 25 years


969
0:45:3,8 --> 0:45:6,1
Of covering
the evolution controversy.


970
0:45:6,1 --> 0:45:7,9
Once you're thick
in science,


971
0:45:7,9 --> 0:45:10,0
You can't question
the paradigm.


972
0:45:10,0 --> 0:45:11,7
But if you want
to get grants,


973
0:45:11,7 --> 0:45:14,3
If you want to be elected
to high positions,


974
0:45:14,3 --> 0:45:17,2
If you want to get awards
as a promoter


975
0:45:17,2 --> 0:45:18,9
Of public education
of science,


976
0:45:18,9 --> 0:45:20,9
You can't question
the paradigm.


977
0:45:20,9 --> 0:45:24,8
People cannot be trusted
to form their own opinions.


978
0:45:24,8 --> 0:45:28,7
This business about
open-mindedness is nonsense.


979
0:45:28,7 --> 0:45:31,1
Why is
the scientific establishment


980
0:45:31,1 --> 0:45:33,3
So afraid of free speech?


981
0:45:33,3 --> 0:45:36,1
There is this fear


982
0:45:36,1 --> 0:45:39,1
That if one aspect
of a theory


983
0:45:39,1 --> 0:45:41,2
Is closely scrutinized,


984
0:45:41,2 --> 0:45:43,5
There's going to be
an unraveling.


985
0:45:43,5 --> 0:45:44,8
Who are you?


986
0:45:44,8 --> 0:45:45,8
Oh, uh--


987
0:45:45,8 --> 0:45:47,8
I am the great
and powerful...


988
0:45:47,8 --> 0:45:49,5
[weakly] ...Wizard of oz.


989
0:45:49,5 --> 0:45:52,5
I interviewed
dozens and dozens
of scientists,


990
0:45:52,5 --> 0:45:54,7
And when they're
amongst each other


991
0:45:54,7 --> 0:45:57,7
Or talking
to a journalist
who they trust,


992
0:45:57,7 --> 0:45:59,4
They'll speak about,


993
0:45:59,4 --> 0:46:2,3
Um, you know,
"it's incredibly complex,"


994
0:46:2,3 --> 0:46:4,9
Or "molecular biology's
in a crisis."


995
0:46:4,9 --> 0:46:10,1
But publicly
they can't say that.


996
0:46:10,1 --> 0:46:12,4
Man: keeping a keen eye
on the academy


997
0:46:12,4 --> 0:46:14,4
Are various
watchdog organizations.


998
0:46:14,4 --> 0:46:16,9
Stein: listen to eugenie scott


999
0:46:16,9 --> 0:46:19,5
Of the national center
for science education.


1000
0:46:19,5 --> 0:46:22,5
The ncse has been
at the heart


1001
0:46:22,5 --> 0:46:24,9
Of virtually
every evolution controversy


1002
0:46:24,9 --> 0:46:26,9
Over the past 25 years,


1003
0:46:26,9 --> 0:46:29,7
Vigorously defending
the darwinian gospel.


1004
0:46:29,7 --> 0:46:31,8
Scott: we have had
a lot of business,


1005
0:46:31,8 --> 0:46:34,1
Unfortunately, at ncse
in the last few years


1006
0:46:34,1 --> 0:46:36,1
Because virtually
every state


1007
0:46:36,1 --> 0:46:38,6
In which science
education standards


1008
0:46:38,6 --> 0:46:40,8
Has come up
for consideration


1009
0:46:40,8 --> 0:46:42,2
Has had a big fight


1010
0:46:42,2 --> 0:46:45,0
About the coverage
of evolution in them.


1011
0:46:45,0 --> 0:46:46,8
Scott: ncse was
started by a group


1012
0:46:46,8 --> 0:46:48,4
Of scientists
and teachers


1013
0:46:48,4 --> 0:46:49,9
Who were very concerned


1014
0:46:49,9 --> 0:46:52,1
Because in the late '70s
and early '80s


1015
0:46:52,1 --> 0:46:53,9
There were a lot
of attempts to pass


1016
0:46:53,9 --> 0:46:56,8
"equal time
for creation science
and evolution" laws.


1017
0:46:56,8 --> 0:46:59,8
Clearly, this is something
that neither scientists
nor teachers liked.


1018
0:46:59,8 --> 0:47:2,7
It wasn't exactly "help, help,
the creationists are coming,"


1019
0:47:2,7 --> 0:47:4,4
But, you know, kind of
along those lines.


1020
0:47:4,4 --> 0:47:7,1
Most scientists just
throw up their hands
and say,


1021
0:47:7,1 --> 0:47:10,9
"creationists!
They drive me crazy.
You handle it."


1022
0:47:10,9 --> 0:47:13,9
We've worked a lot
with science education
organizations.


1023
0:47:13,9 --> 0:47:15,8
The most important group
we work with


1024
0:47:15,8 --> 0:47:17,7
Is members
of the faith community,


1025
0:47:17,7 --> 0:47:20,5
Because the best-kept secret
in this controversy


1026
0:47:20,5 --> 0:47:22,8
Is that catholics
and mainstream protestants


1027
0:47:22,8 --> 0:47:24,3
Are okay on evolution.


1028
0:47:24,3 --> 0:47:27,7
Are you sure
about that, eugenie?


1029
0:47:27,7 --> 0:47:30,3
Liberal Christians
have been fighting with


1030
0:47:30,3 --> 0:47:33,2
Conservative Christians
for so long


1031
0:47:33,2 --> 0:47:37,0
That they'll side
with anybody against
the fundamentalists.


1032
0:47:37,0 --> 0:47:40,0
And eugenie scott says,
"well, welcome over."


1033
0:47:40,0 --> 0:47:42,2
There's a kind of
science defense lobby


1034
0:47:42,2 --> 0:47:45,0
Or an evolution defense lobby,
in particular.


1035
0:47:45,0 --> 0:47:47,3
They are mostly atheists,


1036
0:47:47,3 --> 0:47:50,2
But they are wanting to--
desperately wanting


1037
0:47:50,2 --> 0:47:56,8
To be friendly to mainstream,
sensible, religious people.


1038
0:47:56,8 --> 0:47:58,7
And the way you do that
is to tell them


1039
0:47:58,7 --> 0:48:3,9
That there's no incompatibility
between science and religion.


1040
0:48:3,9 --> 0:48:6,8
But is there really
an incompatibility?


1041
0:48:6,8 --> 0:48:10,2
Can't we believe
in God and darwin?


1042
0:48:10,2 --> 0:48:12,4
Implicit in most
evolutionary theory


1043
0:48:12,4 --> 0:48:14,2
Is that either
there's no God,


1044
0:48:14,2 --> 0:48:16,9
Or God can't have
any role in it.


1045
0:48:16,9 --> 0:48:20,0
So, naturally, as many
evolutionists will say,


1046
0:48:20,0 --> 0:48:22,9
It's the strongest engine
for atheism.


1047
0:48:22,9 --> 0:48:24,7
If they called me
as a witness,


1048
0:48:24,7 --> 0:48:27,6
And a lawyer said,


1049
0:48:27,6 --> 0:48:31,5
"dr. Dawkins,
has your belief
in evolution--


1050
0:48:31,5 --> 0:48:34,1
Has your study of evolution
turned you towards atheism?"


1051
0:48:34,1 --> 0:48:35,9
I would have to say yes.


1052
0:48:35,9 --> 0:48:38,4
And that's the worst
possible thing I could say


1053
0:48:38,4 --> 0:48:41,0
For winning that--
that court case.


1054
0:48:41,0 --> 0:48:42,9
So people like me
are bad news


1055
0:48:42,9 --> 0:48:46,2
For the science lobby,
the evolution lobby.


1056
0:48:46,2 --> 0:48:47,7
By the way, i'm being
a hell of a lot


1057
0:48:47,7 --> 0:48:50,3
More frank and honest
in this interview


1058
0:48:50,3 --> 0:48:55,6
Than many people
in this field would be.


1059
0:48:55,6 --> 0:48:57,8
Man: working hard
to keep ideas in check


1060
0:48:57,8 --> 0:48:59,7
Are our friends
in the media.


1061
0:48:59,7 --> 0:49:2,7
Morning paper!
Paper, mister?


1062
0:49:2,7 --> 0:49:5,5
The tendency
of the media is to side
with the establishment


1063
0:49:5,5 --> 0:49:8,4
Because they inherently agree
with the establishment.


1064
0:49:8,4 --> 0:49:10,3
Abrams: eugenie scott,
my understanding is


1065
0:49:10,3 --> 0:49:13,6
That there is not a single
peer-reviewed article out there


1066
0:49:13,6 --> 0:49:17,7
That supports intelligent
design. Am I wrong?


1067
0:49:17,7 --> 0:49:20,2
You are not wrong.
You are correct.


1068
0:49:20,2 --> 0:49:22,3
I believe that
we get coverage,


1069
0:49:22,3 --> 0:49:25,3
But we always get coverage
like we're the outsider,


1070
0:49:25,3 --> 0:49:27,5
Not like it's
an even debate.


1071
0:49:27,5 --> 0:49:30,1
Filmstrip narrator:
but instead of merely
reporting news,


1072
0:49:30,1 --> 0:49:33,0
He analyzes it,
often expressing
his personal opinions.


1073
0:49:33,0 --> 0:49:35,7
We constantly deal
with reporters


1074
0:49:35,7 --> 0:49:38,1
Who refuse even to report


1075
0:49:38,1 --> 0:49:41,5
The correct definition
of intelligent design.


1076
0:49:41,5 --> 0:49:44,4
They, over and over again,
talk about


1077
0:49:44,4 --> 0:49:46,9
"life is so complex,
God must've done it."


1078
0:49:46,9 --> 0:49:49,1
- meyer: let me explain--
- abrams: admit it,
it's religion.


1079
0:49:49,1 --> 0:49:50,7
- it's very simple.
- you can't--it's religion.


1080
0:49:50,7 --> 0:49:52,9
It's a wanton distortion
of our position.


1081
0:49:52,9 --> 0:49:54,6
[phone rings]


1082
0:49:54,6 --> 0:49:55,9
City desk.


1083
0:49:55,9 --> 0:49:57,2
I've got
a hot story here.


1084
0:49:57,2 --> 0:50:0,0
You can look at
associated press stories,


1085
0:50:0,0 --> 0:50:3,9
And the same sentence will
appear in those stories
for 10 years:


1086
0:50:3,9 --> 0:50:6,9
"intelligent design says
that life is too complex."


1087
0:50:6,9 --> 0:50:9,4
It's called a boilerplate.


1088
0:50:9,4 --> 0:50:11,3
And the reporter
never reports any more


1089
0:50:11,3 --> 0:50:13,0
Or gets any new ways
to say it,


1090
0:50:13,0 --> 0:50:16,1
So the public understanding
never advances.


1091
0:50:16,1 --> 0:50:18,1
But what happens
if a reporter


1092
0:50:18,1 --> 0:50:22,0
Decides to take
a more balanced approach
to intelligent design?


1093
0:50:22,0 --> 0:50:25,1
There might be remarkable
pressure on that reporter


1094
0:50:25,1 --> 0:50:28,6
Not to side against
the evolutionists.


1095
0:50:28,6 --> 0:50:30,9
I thought I told you
to kill that story.


1096
0:50:30,9 --> 0:50:33,8
Few reporters
have learned this better


1097
0:50:33,8 --> 0:50:35,9
Than author and journalist
pamela winnick.


1098
0:50:35,9 --> 0:50:38,0
When she refused
to take sides


1099
0:50:38,0 --> 0:50:41,1
In an article she wrote
about intelligent design,


1100
0:50:41,1 --> 0:50:43,9
The darwinists
found a new favorite target.


1101
0:50:43,9 --> 0:50:46,0
Number one--
I wasn't Christian,
I was jewish.


1102
0:50:46,0 --> 0:50:47,6
Number two--
I wasn't religious.


1103
0:50:47,6 --> 0:50:49,4
Number three--
I was not taking


1104
0:50:49,4 --> 0:50:51,8
A position in favor
of creationism.


1105
0:50:51,8 --> 0:50:54,2
I was writing about
intelligent design.


1106
0:50:54,2 --> 0:50:56,0
And it didn't matter.


1107
0:50:56,0 --> 0:50:57,5
After I wrote
that one piece,


1108
0:50:57,5 --> 0:51:0,7
Everything I wrote
on the subject
was scrutinized.


1109
0:51:0,7 --> 0:51:4,2
There were hate letters
coming into the newspaper.


1110
0:51:4,2 --> 0:51:6,6
If you give any credence
to it whatsoever,


1111
0:51:6,6 --> 0:51:8,9
Which means
just writing about it,


1112
0:51:8,9 --> 0:51:12,2
You are just finished
as a journalist.


1113
0:51:12,2 --> 0:51:13,9
Other journalists
we spoke with


1114
0:51:13,9 --> 0:51:17,9
Told similar stories
but didn't dare
appear on camera.


1115
0:51:17,9 --> 0:51:23,5
Filmstrip narrator:
and now the presses
are ready to roll.


1116
0:51:23,5 --> 0:51:25,7
Man: when all other
checkpoints fail,


1117
0:51:25,7 --> 0:51:33,4
There's always the courts.


1118
0:51:33,4 --> 0:51:36,9
We have spent
an enormous amount of time


1119
0:51:36,9 --> 0:51:39,2
Trying to prove
to the court


1120
0:51:39,2 --> 0:51:41,1
What everybody
already knows,


1121
0:51:41,1 --> 0:51:42,7
That intelligent design


1122
0:51:42,7 --> 0:51:45,5
Is a particular
religious belief.


1123
0:51:45,5 --> 0:51:47,2
But I thought
scientific questions


1124
0:51:47,2 --> 0:51:48,9
Were settled
by the evidence,


1125
0:51:48,9 --> 0:51:52,0
Not by taking people
to court and suing them.


1126
0:51:52,0 --> 0:51:55,0
How do other countries
deal with such disputes?


1127
0:51:55,0 --> 0:51:58,7
Dr. Marciej giertych,
a population geneticist


1128
0:51:58,7 --> 0:52:1,7
Who now represents poland
in the european parliament,


1129
0:52:1,7 --> 0:52:4,0
Was able to shed
some light on this topic.


1130
0:52:4,0 --> 0:52:5,8
Giertych:
the censorship of


1131
0:52:5,8 --> 0:52:8,8
Teaching criticism
of evolution


1132
0:52:8,8 --> 0:52:12,0
Is and always was
much stronger in,


1133
0:52:12,0 --> 0:52:14,4
Say, your country,
the United States,


1134
0:52:14,4 --> 0:52:16,1
Than it ever was
in poland.


1135
0:52:16,1 --> 0:52:18,4
Why? Why would
the censorship--


1136
0:52:18,4 --> 0:52:21,4
That is because you have
a political correctness
in your country.


1137
0:52:21,4 --> 0:52:23,7
These issues
are brought to court,


1138
0:52:23,7 --> 0:52:25,2
And the court says


1139
0:52:25,2 --> 0:52:27,0
What you can
and what you cannot teach.


1140
0:52:27,0 --> 0:52:29,9
We want to know
what you teach,


1141
0:52:29,9 --> 0:52:33,0
What books you use,
how you teach it.


1142
0:52:33,0 --> 0:52:34,7
We never had
that sort of way


1143
0:52:34,7 --> 0:52:37,7
Of deciding
scientific issues
in poland.


1144
0:52:37,7 --> 0:52:39,5
We never had
the courts involved.


1145
0:52:39,5 --> 0:52:40,8
So you are saying that


1146
0:52:40,8 --> 0:52:43,3
As far as the teaching
of science is concerned,


1147
0:52:43,3 --> 0:52:47,5
Poland is freer academically
than the United States?


1148
0:52:47,5 --> 0:52:49,7
I think--in this
particular issue


1149
0:52:49,7 --> 0:52:51,6
Of evolution,
I think this is true.


1150
0:52:51,6 --> 0:52:53,6
But how effective
are the courts


1151
0:52:53,6 --> 0:52:55,3
In deciding such matters?


1152
0:52:55,3 --> 0:52:59,3
What about
the general idea that
intelligent design


1153
0:52:59,3 --> 0:53:2,8
Is doomed as a result
of several recent
legal setbacks?


1154
0:53:2,8 --> 0:53:5,5
I think court cases
don't decide anything.


1155
0:53:5,5 --> 0:53:8,4
If you look at
the scopes trial,
who won that trial?


1156
0:53:8,4 --> 0:53:10,8
It wasn't
the evolutionists.
It was the--


1157
0:53:10,8 --> 0:53:13,9
The tennessee law was upheld,
barring evolution,


1158
0:53:13,9 --> 0:53:15,9
And yet in the popular
imagination,


1159
0:53:15,9 --> 0:53:17,4
Scopes is the hero.


1160
0:53:17,4 --> 0:53:19,7
Inherit the wind--
that movie--


1161
0:53:19,7 --> 0:53:22,2
Which is really bogus history
based on the scopes trial,


1162
0:53:22,2 --> 0:53:23,7
Has carried the day.


1163
0:53:23,7 --> 0:53:27,6
These issues go much deeper
than any decision by a judge.


1164
0:53:27,6 --> 0:53:29,1
The evolution debate


1165
0:53:29,1 --> 0:53:31,9
Does seem to run much deeper
than the courts,


1166
0:53:31,9 --> 0:53:33,8
Much deeper even
than science.


1167
0:53:33,8 --> 0:53:36,4
To generate
this level of hostility,


1168
0:53:36,4 --> 0:53:39,1
Id must threaten something
at the very core


1169
0:53:39,1 --> 0:53:43,1
Of the darwinian
establishment.


1170
0:53:43,1 --> 0:53:45,0
Filmstrip narrator:
the entire globe


1171
0:53:45,0 --> 0:53:48,0
Is today the site
of a momentous conflict.


1172
0:53:48,0 --> 0:53:56,1
It is the challenge
of ideas.


1173
0:53:56,1 --> 0:53:57,6
I'm edward r. Murrow.


1174
0:53:57,6 --> 0:53:58,8
For a little while,


1175
0:53:58,8 --> 0:54:0,5
I would like to review
with you


1176
0:54:0,5 --> 0:54:2,8
The great conflict
of our times,


1177
0:54:2,8 --> 0:54:4,6
One which demands
and must get


1178
0:54:4,6 --> 0:54:6,4
The attention
and the involvement


1179
0:54:6,4 --> 0:54:8,0
Of each one of us.


1180
0:54:8,0 --> 0:54:10,5
This conflict


1181
0:54:10,5 --> 0:54:14,6
Over the principles
of evolution


1182
0:54:14,6 --> 0:54:17,8
Has become
a religious war.


1183
0:54:17,8 --> 0:54:22,3
It really is no longer
about scientific
investigation.


1184
0:54:22,3 --> 0:54:25,6
It is total competition
with an antagonist


1185
0:54:25,6 --> 0:54:26,7
Who is putting into it


1186
0:54:26,7 --> 0:54:28,9
Everything
within his capability.


1187
0:54:28,9 --> 0:54:31,6
The situation
has reached a point


1188
0:54:31,6 --> 0:54:34,0
Where many
of evolution's top apologists


1189
0:54:34,0 --> 0:54:36,7
Have switched
from defending darwinism


1190
0:54:36,7 --> 0:54:39,5
To attacking religion,
in what they see as a bid


1191
0:54:39,5 --> 0:54:42,1
To stamp out
intelligent design
at the source.


1192
0:54:42,1 --> 0:54:45,3
Richard dawkins
is the best example of this.


1193
0:54:45,3 --> 0:54:47,6
His recent book,
the God delusion,


1194
0:54:47,6 --> 0:54:50,6
Has sold over
one million copies worldwide.


1195
0:54:50,6 --> 0:54:51,8
The God delusion


1196
0:54:51,8 --> 0:54:57,6
Is my long-expected,
long-worked-on,


1197
0:54:57,6 --> 0:54:59,7
Full-frontal attack
on religion.


1198
0:54:59,7 --> 0:55:3,7
To me, science is about
trying to explain existence,


1199
0:55:3,7 --> 0:55:6,7
And religion is about
trying to explain existence.


1200
0:55:6,7 --> 0:55:9,1
It's just that religion
gets the wrong answer.


1201
0:55:9,1 --> 0:55:10,9
But is dawkins correct?


1202
0:55:10,9 --> 0:55:14,1
Are science and religion
really at war?


1203
0:55:14,1 --> 0:55:18,0
For an appraisal
of this continuing
and protracted conflict,


1204
0:55:18,0 --> 0:55:19,7
We can go to a reporter


1205
0:55:19,7 --> 0:55:21,7
Who has watched
the growing conflict


1206
0:55:21,7 --> 0:55:24,7
With the perception of
a trained military observer.


1207
0:55:24,7 --> 0:55:27,1
Oxford professor
alister mcgrath,


1208
0:55:27,1 --> 0:55:29,7
Author of
the dawkins delusion,


1209
0:55:29,7 --> 0:55:32,2
Seemed like the ideal person
to answer my question.


1210
0:55:32,2 --> 0:55:34,6
Mcgrath: richard dawkins
has a charming


1211
0:55:34,6 --> 0:55:37,0
And very, I think,
interesting view


1212
0:55:37,0 --> 0:55:39,4
Of the relationship
between science and religion.


1213
0:55:39,4 --> 0:55:40,9
They're at war
with each other,


1214
0:55:40,9 --> 0:55:43,1
And in the end,
one's got to win.


1215
0:55:43,1 --> 0:55:45,2
And it's going
to be science.


1216
0:55:45,2 --> 0:55:46,8
It's a very naive view.


1217
0:55:46,8 --> 0:55:50,5
It's based on
a complete historical
misrepresentation


1218
0:55:50,5 --> 0:55:52,9
Of the way
science and religion
have interacted.


1219
0:55:52,9 --> 0:55:56,2
Dawkins seems to think
that scientific description


1220
0:55:56,2 --> 0:55:58,5
Is an anti-religious
argument.


1221
0:55:58,5 --> 0:56:1,6
Describing
how something happens
scientifically


1222
0:56:1,6 --> 0:56:3,7
Somehow explains it away.


1223
0:56:3,7 --> 0:56:4,8
It doesn't.


1224
0:56:4,8 --> 0:56:7,7
But the questions
of purpose, intentionality,


1225
0:56:7,7 --> 0:56:9,3
The question why,


1226
0:56:9,3 --> 0:56:11,7
Still remain there
on the table.


1227
0:56:11,7 --> 0:56:13,9
I think it was just
a catastrophic mistake


1228
0:56:13,9 --> 0:56:16,3
To have someone like
dawkins address himself


1229
0:56:16,3 --> 0:56:18,1
To profound issues
of theology,


1230
0:56:18,1 --> 0:56:19,8
The existence of God,
the nature of life.


1231
0:56:19,8 --> 0:56:21,4
He hasn't committed
himself to


1232
0:56:21,4 --> 0:56:23,7
Disciplined study
in any relevant area
of inquiry.


1233
0:56:23,7 --> 0:56:25,5
He's a crummy philosopher.


1234
0:56:25,5 --> 0:56:27,7
He doesn't have
the rudimentary skills


1235
0:56:27,7 --> 0:56:31,1
To meticulously assess
his own arguments.


1236
0:56:31,1 --> 0:56:32,6
Genius guy, though.


1237
0:56:32,6 --> 0:56:33,7
Very smart guy.


1238
0:56:33,7 --> 0:56:36,1
Little bit of a reptile,
but very smart guy.


1239
0:56:36,1 --> 0:56:38,6
The opposing point of view
in this conflict


1240
0:56:38,6 --> 0:56:41,8
Rests on a fundamentally
different vision of man.


1241
0:56:41,8 --> 0:56:43,9
If you have two
distinguished scientists--


1242
0:56:43,9 --> 0:56:47,3
And, in fact, you can range
many more on each side,
as you know--


1243
0:56:47,3 --> 0:56:50,2
Saying exactly
opposite things,


1244
0:56:50,2 --> 0:56:52,5
That's telling me
that the conflict


1245
0:56:52,5 --> 0:56:55,6
Is not between science
and belief in God.


1246
0:56:55,6 --> 0:56:58,5
Otherwise you'd expect
all scientists
to be atheists.


1247
0:56:58,5 --> 0:57:0,1
But it's
a worldview conflict.


1248
0:57:0,1 --> 0:57:2,8
It's between scientists
who have different worldviews.


1249
0:57:2,8 --> 0:57:5,5
You've got two
competing explanations
of the evidence.


1250
0:57:5,5 --> 0:57:7,8
One says design,
one says undirected processes.


1251
0:57:7,8 --> 0:57:10,8
Both of them have
larger philosophical
or religious


1252
0:57:10,8 --> 0:57:12,6
Or anti-religious
implications.


1253
0:57:12,6 --> 0:57:15,9
So you can't say that
one of those two theories
is scientific


1254
0:57:15,9 --> 0:57:17,6
And the other
is unscientific


1255
0:57:17,6 --> 0:57:19,6
Simply because
they have implications.


1256
0:57:19,6 --> 0:57:20,7
Both have implications.


1257
0:57:20,7 --> 0:57:21,6
People who tell you,


1258
0:57:21,6 --> 0:57:23,1
For example,
that science tells you


1259
0:57:23,1 --> 0:57:24,3
All you need to know
about the world


1260
0:57:24,3 --> 0:57:26,6
Or that science tells you
that religion is all wrong


1261
0:57:26,6 --> 0:57:28,2
Or science tells you
there is no God,


1262
0:57:28,2 --> 0:57:30,9
Those people aren't telling
you scientific things.


1263
0:57:30,9 --> 0:57:32,7
They are saying
metaphysical things,


1264
0:57:32,7 --> 0:57:34,8
And they have to defend
their positions


1265
0:57:34,8 --> 0:57:36,0
For metaphysical reasons.


1266
0:57:36,0 --> 0:57:39,4
What is being presented
to the public is


1267
0:57:39,4 --> 0:57:41,6
First comes the science,


1268
0:57:41,6 --> 0:57:44,7
And then comes
the worldview.


1269
0:57:44,7 --> 0:57:47,5
I would want to argue that
that may not be the case,


1270
0:57:47,5 --> 0:57:49,8
That it may actually be
the other way 'round,


1271
0:57:49,8 --> 0:57:52,8
That the worldview
comes first


1272
0:57:52,8 --> 0:57:55,9
And is influencing
the interpretation
of science.


1273
0:57:55,9 --> 0:57:57,7
My deep regret
is some people


1274
0:57:57,7 --> 0:58:1,6
Are so deeply entrenched
in their own worldviews


1275
0:58:1,6 --> 0:58:6,9
That they will simply not
countenance alternatives.


1276
0:58:6,9 --> 0:58:9,0
I'm actually
a person of the left,


1277
0:58:9,0 --> 0:58:10,9
And not even a particularly
religious person.


1278
0:58:10,9 --> 0:58:12,7
I think of myself
as kind of humanist.


1279
0:58:12,7 --> 0:58:15,3
And I think it's sending
a very bad message


1280
0:58:15,3 --> 0:58:18,1
To religious people
who are interested
in science


1281
0:58:18,1 --> 0:58:19,4
That in some sense,


1282
0:58:19,4 --> 0:58:20,9
In order to do
science credibly,


1283
0:58:20,9 --> 0:58:23,3
They have to leave
their religious beliefs
at the door.


1284
0:58:23,3 --> 0:58:25,0
The founders
of early modern science--


1285
0:58:25,0 --> 0:58:26,5
Sir isaac newton,
robert boyle,


1286
0:58:26,5 --> 0:58:28,7
Johannes kepler,
galileo--


1287
0:58:28,7 --> 0:58:31,6
Most of these
early scientists


1288
0:58:31,6 --> 0:58:33,1
All not only
believed in God,


1289
0:58:33,1 --> 0:58:34,8
But they thought
their belief in God


1290
0:58:34,8 --> 0:58:37,3
Actually made it
easier to do science.


1291
0:58:37,3 --> 0:58:38,9
You can be
religiously motivated


1292
0:58:38,9 --> 0:58:40,3
And you can
do good science,


1293
0:58:40,3 --> 0:58:42,4
And they have more
often gone together


1294
0:58:42,4 --> 0:58:43,9
Than not gone together.


1295
0:58:43,9 --> 0:58:45,7
Admitting our biases


1296
0:58:45,7 --> 0:58:48,6
Is the best way towards
rational discussion,


1297
0:58:48,6 --> 0:58:50,2
Which I would welcome.


1298
0:58:50,2 --> 0:58:53,3
Rational debate
is a nice thought,


1299
0:58:53,3 --> 0:58:56,2
But it's nearly impossible
in the current climate.


1300
0:58:56,2 --> 0:58:57,9
I'd seen the chilling effect


1301
0:58:57,9 --> 0:59:0,9
That this unquestioning
devotion to darwinism


1302
0:59:0,9 --> 0:59:3,0
Has had on science...


1303
0:59:3,0 --> 0:59:8,1
But were there
other consequences?


1304
0:59:8,1 --> 0:59:11,7
No Gods,
no life after death,


1305
0:59:11,7 --> 0:59:13,8
No ultimate foundation
for ethics,


1306
0:59:13,8 --> 0:59:16,6
No ultimate meaning
in life,


1307
0:59:16,6 --> 0:59:20,0
And no human free will


1308
0:59:20,0 --> 0:59:25,3
Are all deeply connected
to an evolutionary perspective.


1309
0:59:25,3 --> 0:59:27,7
You're here today
and then gone tomorrow,


1310
0:59:27,7 --> 0:59:29,5
And that's
all there is to it.


1311
0:59:29,5 --> 0:59:31,5
Stein: dr. Will provine,


1312
0:59:31,5 --> 0:59:33,9
Professor
of the history of biology


1313
0:59:33,9 --> 0:59:35,5
At cornell university,


1314
0:59:35,5 --> 0:59:38,2
Gave us another
disturbing glimpse


1315
0:59:38,2 --> 0:59:40,2
Into where darwinism
can lead.


1316
0:59:40,2 --> 0:59:41,7
Oh, I was a Christian,


1317
0:59:41,7 --> 0:59:44,9
But I never heard
anything about evolution


1318
0:59:44,9 --> 0:59:49,6
Because it was illegal
to teach it in tennessee.


1319
0:59:49,6 --> 0:59:53,6
Dr. Provine's first biology
professor changed all that.


1320
0:59:53,6 --> 0:59:56,2
He started talking
about evolution


1321
0:59:56,2 --> 0:59:58,9
As if it had no design
in it whatsoever.


1322
0:59:58,9 --> 1:0:0,8
And I came up to him,
and I said,


1323
1:0:0,8 --> 1:0:2,9
"you left out
the most important part."


1324
1:0:2,9 --> 1:0:6,3
And he said,
"if you feel the same way
at the end of one quarter,


1325
1:0:6,3 --> 1:0:9,6
"I want you to stand up
in front of the students
in this class


1326
1:0:9,6 --> 1:0:12,7
And tell them
this deep lack
in evolution."


1327
1:0:12,7 --> 1:0:15,8
And I read that book
so carefully,


1328
1:0:15,8 --> 1:0:19,6
And I could find
no sign of there being


1329
1:0:19,6 --> 1:0:23,3
Any design whatsoever
in evolution.


1330
1:0:23,3 --> 1:0:26,3
And I immediately
began to doubt


1331
1:0:26,3 --> 1:0:30,8
The existence
of the deity.


1332
1:0:30,8 --> 1:0:33,6
But it starts by giving up
an active deity.


1333
1:0:33,6 --> 1:0:35,5
Then he gives up the hope


1334
1:0:35,5 --> 1:0:37,6
That there's
any life after death.


1335
1:0:37,6 --> 1:0:39,0
When you give
those two up,


1336
1:0:39,0 --> 1:0:41,7
The rest of it follows
fairly easily.


1337
1:0:41,7 --> 1:0:43,2
You give up the hope


1338
1:0:43,2 --> 1:0:45,8
That there's
an eminent morality.


1339
1:0:45,8 --> 1:0:49,2
And finally, there's
no human free will.


1340
1:0:49,2 --> 1:0:51,0
If you believe
in evolution,


1341
1:0:51,0 --> 1:0:55,4
You can't hope for there
being any free will.


1342
1:0:55,4 --> 1:0:58,2
There's no hope whatsoever


1343
1:0:58,2 --> 1:1:1,7
Of there being any
deep meaning in human life.


1344
1:1:1,7 --> 1:1:4,6
We live, we die,
and we're gone.


1345
1:1:4,6 --> 1:1:7,0
We're absolutely gone
when we die.


1346
1:1:7,0 --> 1:1:11,0
Dr. Provine is no stranger
to the prospect of death.


1347
1:1:11,0 --> 1:1:12,6
Nearly a decade ago,


1348
1:1:12,6 --> 1:1:15,9
He was diagnosed
with a large brain tumor.


1349
1:1:15,9 --> 1:1:17,9
Let's suppose
my tumor comes back,


1350
1:1:17,9 --> 1:1:19,8
As it almost certainly will.


1351
1:1:19,8 --> 1:1:22,0
Well, i'm not
going to sit around


1352
1:1:22,0 --> 1:1:25,0
Like my older brother
did last year.


1353
1:1:25,0 --> 1:1:28,4
And he was dying of als,
lou gehrig's disease.


1354
1:1:28,4 --> 1:1:33,5
He wanted desperately to die,
but we couldn't help him die.


1355
1:1:33,5 --> 1:1:35,2
I don't want to die
like that.


1356
1:1:35,2 --> 1:1:38,5
I'm going to shoot myself
in the head long before then.


1357
1:1:38,5 --> 1:1:41,1
I'm going to do
something different.


1358
1:1:41,1 --> 1:1:43,1
I hope these
are empty words


1359
1:1:43,1 --> 1:1:45,2
From my friend
dr. Provine,


1360
1:1:45,2 --> 1:1:47,8
Because shortly after
this interview was recorded


1361
1:1:47,8 --> 1:1:50,6
He learned his brain tumor
had returned.


1362
1:1:50,6 --> 1:1:52,4
Provine: I don't feel
one bit bad


1363
1:1:52,4 --> 1:1:54,1
About holding
the views that I do.


1364
1:1:54,1 --> 1:1:56,9
There's not anything
in the views I hold


1365
1:1:56,9 --> 1:1:59,8
That makes me, "oh,
I wish I had free will,"


1366
1:1:59,8 --> 1:2:2,3
Or "oh, I wish
there were a God."


1367
1:2:2,3 --> 1:2:5,3
I don't ever,
ever wish for that.


1368
1:2:5,3 --> 1:2:7,7
Dr. Provine's
de-conversion story


1369
1:2:7,7 --> 1:2:10,6
Was typical amongst
the darwinists
we interviewed.


1370
1:2:10,6 --> 1:2:12,8
Biologist p.Z. Myers,


1371
1:2:12,8 --> 1:2:17,1
Who runs the pro-darwin,
anti-religion blog pharyngula,


1372
1:2:17,1 --> 1:2:20,3
Says science eroded
his faith as well.


1373
1:2:20,3 --> 1:2:21,6
I never hated religion.


1374
1:2:21,6 --> 1:2:23,9
I found religion
quite comfortable,


1375
1:2:23,9 --> 1:2:26,5
And I liked
the people in it.


1376
1:2:26,5 --> 1:2:29,6
What led to the atheism was
learning more about science,


1377
1:2:29,6 --> 1:2:31,6
Learning more
about the natural world,


1378
1:2:31,6 --> 1:2:34,2
And seeing these horrible
conflicts with religion.


1379
1:2:34,2 --> 1:2:37,6
And it was then,
when I discovered evolution,


1380
1:2:37,6 --> 1:2:39,3
When I discovered darwinism,


1381
1:2:39,3 --> 1:2:41,8
That I realized there's
this magnificently elegant,


1382
1:2:41,8 --> 1:2:44,3
Stunningly elegant
explanation--


1383
1:2:44,3 --> 1:2:46,7
Which I didn't quite
understand to begin with--


1384
1:2:46,7 --> 1:2:48,2
But when I did
understand it,


1385
1:2:48,2 --> 1:2:52,2
Then that finally killed off
my remaining religious faith.


1386
1:2:52,2 --> 1:2:53,9
After hearing these stories,


1387
1:2:53,9 --> 1:2:55,9
I was not surprised
to discover


1388
1:2:55,9 --> 1:2:58,0
That most evolutionary
biologists


1389
1:2:58,0 --> 1:3:0,5
Share
professor dawkins' views.


1390
1:3:0,5 --> 1:3:3,3
It appears darwinism
does lead to atheism


1391
1:3:3,3 --> 1:3:6,6
Despite what eugenie scott
would have us believe.


1392
1:3:6,6 --> 1:3:12,1
And if you separate out
the ethical message
from religion,


1393
1:3:12,1 --> 1:3:14,9
What have you got left?


1394
1:3:14,9 --> 1:3:17,9
You've got a bunch
of fairy tales, right?


1395
1:3:17,9 --> 1:3:21,2
I think that God
is about as unlikely


1396
1:3:21,2 --> 1:3:26,7
As fairies, angels,
hobgoblins, etc.


1397
1:3:26,7 --> 1:3:30,2
Religion--I mean,
it's just fantasy, basically.


1398
1:3:30,2 --> 1:3:35,4
It's completely empty
of any explanatory content...


1399
1:3:35,4 --> 1:3:38,2
And is evil as well.
[chuckles]


1400
1:3:38,2 --> 1:3:41,1
Half the people in this country
think that drugs


1401
1:3:41,1 --> 1:3:43,4
Is what you have to regulate
to make us safer,


1402
1:3:43,4 --> 1:3:44,9
And half the people
think guns--


1403
1:3:44,9 --> 1:3:46,8
That's what
you gotta regulate
to make us safer.


1404
1:3:46,8 --> 1:3:49,0
But I always think
that if you're
going to regulate


1405
1:3:49,0 --> 1:3:51,1
One thing that has
the most potential


1406
1:3:51,1 --> 1:3:54,1
To cause death
and destruction--
religion.


1407
1:3:54,1 --> 1:3:56,1
You gotta start
with religion.


1408
1:3:56,1 --> 1:3:58,8
[audience applauds]


1409
1:3:58,8 --> 1:4:2,8
Religion is an idea that
gives some people comfort,


1410
1:4:2,8 --> 1:4:5,1
And we don't want to take
it away from them.


1411
1:4:5,1 --> 1:4:7,6
It's like knitting.
People like to knit.


1412
1:4:7,6 --> 1:4:10,3
We're not going to take
their knitting needles away.


1413
1:4:10,3 --> 1:4:12,5
We're not going to take away
their churches.


1414
1:4:12,5 --> 1:4:14,8
But what we have to do
is get it to a place


1415
1:4:14,8 --> 1:4:17,1
Where religion is treated


1416
1:4:17,1 --> 1:4:18,9
At the level
it should be treated.


1417
1:4:18,9 --> 1:4:21,2
That is, something fun


1418
1:4:21,2 --> 1:4:23,9
That people get together
and do on the weekend


1419
1:4:23,9 --> 1:4:27,0
And really doesn't
affect their life


1420
1:4:27,0 --> 1:4:28,7
As much as it
has been so far.


1421
1:4:28,7 --> 1:4:31,2
Stein: so what would
the world look like


1422
1:4:31,2 --> 1:4:33,3
If dr. Meyers got his wish?


1423
1:4:33,3 --> 1:4:34,8
Greater science literacy,


1424
1:4:34,8 --> 1:4:36,6
Which is going to lead
to the erosion of religion,


1425
1:4:36,6 --> 1:4:39,2
And then we'll get
this nice positive
feedback mechanism going,


1426
1:4:39,2 --> 1:4:40,8
Where as religion
slowly fades away,


1427
1:4:40,8 --> 1:4:42,6
We get more and more science
to replace it.


1428
1:4:42,6 --> 1:4:44,6
And that will displace
more and more religion,


1429
1:4:44,6 --> 1:4:46,7
Which will allow
more and more science in,


1430
1:4:46,7 --> 1:4:48,8
And we'll eventually
get to that point


1431
1:4:48,8 --> 1:4:52,4
Where religion has taken
that appropriate place


1432
1:4:52,4 --> 1:4:56,0
As a side dish
rather than the main course.


1433
1:4:56,0 --> 1:4:58,6
Stein: but will
eradicating religion


1434
1:4:58,6 --> 1:5:2,9
Really lead
to a modern utopia?


1435
1:5:2,9 --> 1:5:5,2
Hmm.


1436
1:5:5,2 --> 1:5:7,7
Let me try to imagine that.


1437
1:5:7,7 --> 1:5:15,4
And let's let history
be our guide.


1438
1:5:15,4 --> 1:5:17,9
Berlinski: in part,
I think matthew arnold


1439
1:5:17,9 --> 1:5:20,2
Put his hands on it
when he spoke about


1440
1:5:20,2 --> 1:5:22,7
Um, the withdrawal
of faith.


1441
1:5:22,7 --> 1:5:25,1
There is a connection
between a society


1442
1:5:25,1 --> 1:5:27,2
That has at least
a minimal commitment


1443
1:5:27,2 --> 1:5:30,9
To certain kinds of
transcendental values


1444
1:5:30,9 --> 1:5:32,9
And what human beings
permit themselves


1445
1:5:32,9 --> 1:5:35,0
To do one to the other.


1446
1:5:35,0 --> 1:5:36,8
That got me thinking.


1447
1:5:36,8 --> 1:5:39,4
What other societies
have used darwinism


1448
1:5:39,4 --> 1:5:41,1
To trump
all other authorities,


1449
1:5:41,1 --> 1:5:42,9
Including religion?


1450
1:5:42,9 --> 1:5:44,1
As a jew,


1451
1:5:44,1 --> 1:5:47,0
My mind leapt to one regime
in particular.


1452
1:5:47,0 --> 1:5:49,4
The connection
between hitler and darwin


1453
1:5:49,4 --> 1:5:52,1
Is of course historically
a difficult connection


1454
1:5:52,1 --> 1:5:54,6
Because they were separated
by a good many years.


1455
1:5:54,6 --> 1:5:56,3
One was english,
one was german.


1456
1:5:56,3 --> 1:5:59,9
Nonetheless,
if you open mein kampf
and read it--


1457
1:5:59,9 --> 1:6:2,5
Especially if you can
read it in german--


1458
1:6:2,5 --> 1:6:5,2
The correspondence
between darwinian ideas


1459
1:6:5,2 --> 1:6:8,1
And nazi ideas just
leaps from the page.


1460
1:6:8,1 --> 1:6:10,6
Of course you have to add
every historical caution.


1461
1:6:10,6 --> 1:6:14,1
Not everyone who read darwin
became a nazi, obviously not.


1462
1:6:14,1 --> 1:6:15,9
No one is making that case.


1463
1:6:15,9 --> 1:6:19,4
Darwinism is not
a sufficient condition


1464
1:6:19,4 --> 1:6:21,6
For a phenomenon
like nazism,


1465
1:6:21,6 --> 1:6:24,5
But I think it's certainly
a necessary one.


1466
1:6:24,5 --> 1:6:32,8
This was a connection
I had to explore personally.


1467
1:6:32,8 --> 1:6:43,1
[church bells tolling]


1468
1:6:43,1 --> 1:6:46,0
Filmstrip narrator:
american officers arrive
at a nazi institution


1469
1:6:46,0 --> 1:6:47,3
Seized by first army troops.


1470
1:6:47,3 --> 1:6:49,1
Under the guise
of an insane asylum,


1471
1:6:49,1 --> 1:6:50,6
This has been
the headquarters


1472
1:6:50,6 --> 1:6:52,0
For the systematic murder...


1473
1:6:52,0 --> 1:6:57,0
[filmstrip audio fades]


1474
1:6:57,0 --> 1:6:58,4
Stein: so, what
is this place?


1475
1:6:58,4 --> 1:7:0,2
During
the second world war,


1476
1:7:0,2 --> 1:7:3,2
15,000 people
were killed here.


1477
1:7:3,2 --> 1:7:5,1
Why were they killed?


1478
1:7:5,1 --> 1:7:8,5
They were killed
because they were
people with handicaps.


1479
1:7:8,5 --> 1:7:10,7
Why kill them?
What's the point
of killing them?


1480
1:7:10,7 --> 1:7:12,5
People who were
not able to work,


1481
1:7:12,5 --> 1:7:15,7
People who were not able
to live by themselves,


1482
1:7:15,7 --> 1:7:17,7
That they were
"useless eaters."


1483
1:7:17,7 --> 1:7:19,0
"useless eaters."


1484
1:7:19,0 --> 1:7:22,2
And "life
unworthy of living."


1485
1:7:22,2 --> 1:7:24,4
George: this idea
grew up in the '20s,


1486
1:7:24,4 --> 1:7:26,5
So long before
national socialism,


1487
1:7:26,5 --> 1:7:28,3
Biologists,
anthropologists,


1488
1:7:28,3 --> 1:7:32,8
They thought that
maybe mankind could--


1489
1:7:32,8 --> 1:7:36,0
Or the government
could interfere


1490
1:7:36,0 --> 1:7:38,3
- into the growth
of the population.
- stein: I see.


1491
1:7:38,3 --> 1:7:40,4
And they had the...
Utopia?


1492
1:7:40,4 --> 1:7:41,9
- utopia.
- utopia...


1493
1:7:41,9 --> 1:7:43,9
That they would
have a society


1494
1:7:43,9 --> 1:7:46,4
Without illness
and without handicap.


1495
1:7:46,4 --> 1:8:11,0
[man speaking german]


1496
1:8:11,0 --> 1:8:13,4
So this was
a darwinian concept.


1497
1:8:13,4 --> 1:8:15,6
- yes.
- and also
a malthusian concept,


1498
1:8:15,6 --> 1:8:17,0
Very much malthusian.


1499
1:8:17,0 --> 1:8:19,6
- malthusian?
- thomas malthus, who said


1500
1:8:19,6 --> 1:8:22,0
That there was
a shortage of resources.


1501
1:8:22,0 --> 1:8:24,1
English philosopher,
said there was a shortage--


1502
1:8:24,1 --> 1:8:27,0
Yes, but the nazis,
they relied on darwin.


1503
1:8:27,0 --> 1:8:32,1
- they relied on darwin.
- yes, darwin
and german scientists.


1504
1:8:32,1 --> 1:8:35,0
Patients were led
down this hallway


1505
1:8:35,0 --> 1:8:36,7
To nazi doctors,


1506
1:8:36,7 --> 1:8:40,6
Who decided who would live
and who would die.


1507
1:8:40,6 --> 1:8:46,7
They were accompanied
by 15, um, 15 nurses.


1508
1:8:46,7 --> 1:8:47,8
- nurses.
- nurses.


1509
1:8:47,8 --> 1:8:49,5
Male and female nurses.


1510
1:8:49,5 --> 1:8:52,4
So nurses were helping
lead them to their doom.


1511
1:8:52,4 --> 1:9:13,8
Yes.


1512
1:9:13,8 --> 1:9:15,9
So, were the prisoners told
they were taking a shower?


1513
1:9:15,9 --> 1:9:17,2
Yes, they were
taking a shower,


1514
1:9:17,2 --> 1:9:18,7
And here was
one or two showers.


1515
1:9:18,7 --> 1:9:22,3
So, how many people were
brought into this room?


1516
1:9:22,3 --> 1:9:33,0
Sixty to seventy.


1517
1:9:33,0 --> 1:9:34,5
So, what is this?


1518
1:9:34,5 --> 1:9:36,8
This is
the dissection table.


1519
1:9:36,8 --> 1:9:38,9
Do you ever think
to yourself


1520
1:9:38,9 --> 1:9:40,5
The sane ones
were the ones


1521
1:9:40,5 --> 1:9:42,9
Lying here having
their brains removed--


1522
1:9:42,9 --> 1:9:45,8
The insane one was
dr. Gorgass and all
the other people--?


1523
1:9:45,8 --> 1:9:47,5
No, no,
I don't think that


1524
1:9:47,5 --> 1:9:50,7
Because I think
those people who killed here,


1525
1:9:50,7 --> 1:9:54,0
They were very sane
because they had
their purposes.


1526
1:9:54,0 --> 1:9:55,2
They had purposes?


1527
1:9:55,2 --> 1:10:7,4
Yes. I don't think
they were insane.


1528
1:10:7,4 --> 1:10:9,9
- they had
two crematory ovens.
- I see.


1529
1:10:9,9 --> 1:10:12,1
And they killed
about 70 people.


1530
1:10:12,1 --> 1:10:14,7
- a day.
- a day, so they had--


1531
1:10:14,7 --> 1:10:17,4
That's barely enough time.
They had their work--


1532
1:10:17,4 --> 1:10:21,1
They only killed from
Monday to Friday, so...


1533
1:10:21,1 --> 1:10:23,0
Because the people who
were doing the killing


1534
1:10:23,0 --> 1:10:24,6
Needed to have
the weekend off.


1535
1:10:24,6 --> 1:10:29,6
If you met dr. Gorgass today,
what would you say to him?


1536
1:10:29,6 --> 1:10:31,4
I don't know.


1537
1:10:31,4 --> 1:10:34,7
I don't think that
it's my--my role


1538
1:10:34,7 --> 1:10:38,6
To--to tell
him something.


1539
1:10:38,6 --> 1:10:40,3
It's difficult to describe


1540
1:10:40,3 --> 1:10:43,4
How it felt to walk
through such a haunting place,


1541
1:10:43,4 --> 1:10:47,1
To know that these cold
stone and tile walls


1542
1:10:47,1 --> 1:10:53,0
Were the last things
the victims of hadamar
ever saw.


1543
1:10:53,0 --> 1:10:56,3
I wanted to explore
this connection further,


1544
1:10:56,3 --> 1:10:59,8
So I met with the author
of from darwin to hitler,


1545
1:10:59,8 --> 1:11:2,3
Dr. Richard weikart.


1546
1:11:2,3 --> 1:11:5,2
Hitler and many
of the physicians


1547
1:11:5,2 --> 1:11:6,8
That carried out
this program


1548
1:11:6,8 --> 1:11:8,6
Were very fanatical
darwinists


1549
1:11:8,6 --> 1:11:11,7
And particularly wanted to apply
darwinism to society.


1550
1:11:11,7 --> 1:11:33,5
[hitler speaking german]


1551
1:11:33,5 --> 1:11:36,4
Many of these people
in the 19-teens, 1920s


1552
1:11:36,4 --> 1:11:39,0
Who were putting forward some
of these ideas about racism


1553
1:11:39,0 --> 1:11:42,5
Were considered
the leading scientists.


1554
1:11:42,5 --> 1:11:46,3
These were darwinists
who were taken seriously
by fellow academics.


1555
1:11:46,3 --> 1:11:48,5
It's not to say
that all academics
believed it.


1556
1:11:48,5 --> 1:11:52,0
These leading academics,
were there any of them
who were americans?


1557
1:11:52,0 --> 1:11:53,4
There were plenty
of americans


1558
1:11:53,4 --> 1:11:56,1
Who were saying
similar kinds of things.


1559
1:11:56,1 --> 1:11:59,3
Not only were americans
saying such things,


1560
1:11:59,3 --> 1:12:2,3
They were pioneers
in this fledging science


1561
1:12:2,3 --> 1:12:4,6
Known as eugenics.


1562
1:12:4,6 --> 1:12:7,0
They thought
they could help
evolution along


1563
1:12:7,0 --> 1:12:10,6
By sterilizing
the so-called feeble-minded


1564
1:12:10,6 --> 1:12:14,3
And prohibiting them
from getting married.


1565
1:12:14,3 --> 1:12:17,4
Physicians who
are aware of the history


1566
1:12:17,4 --> 1:12:19,3
Of 20th-century
american medicine


1567
1:12:19,3 --> 1:12:23,1
Harbor some bad feelings
towards darwinists


1568
1:12:23,1 --> 1:12:24,8
Because of eugenics.


1569
1:12:24,8 --> 1:12:26,0
And eugenics--


1570
1:12:26,0 --> 1:12:29,0
Which was an attempt
to breed human beings--


1571
1:12:29,0 --> 1:12:32,7
It was the darkest chapter
of american medicine ever.


1572
1:12:32,7 --> 1:12:35,6
There were 50,000 people
involuntarily sterilized


1573
1:12:35,6 --> 1:12:42,4
Because they were deemed
unfit to breed, basically.


1574
1:12:42,4 --> 1:12:44,7
Stein: eugenics
isn't just history.


1575
1:12:44,7 --> 1:12:49,6
The spirit of the movement
lives on today.


1576
1:12:49,6 --> 1:12:51,0
Weikart: margaret sanger


1577
1:12:51,0 --> 1:12:52,7
Was the head
of planned parenthood.


1578
1:12:52,7 --> 1:12:55,4
She was very fanatical
in her promotion of eugenics.


1579
1:12:55,4 --> 1:12:58,5
In fact, planned parenthood
was all about birth control


1580
1:12:58,5 --> 1:13:1,0
For the impoverished
and lower classes


1581
1:13:1,0 --> 1:13:8,6
To try to help improve
the species.


1582
1:13:8,6 --> 1:13:10,0
From hadamar,


1583
1:13:10,0 --> 1:13:13,1
I traveled
with dr. Weikart to dachau,


1584
1:13:13,1 --> 1:13:16,0
Where the nazis applied
the ideas of eugenics


1585
1:13:16,0 --> 1:13:21,3
On a massive
mechanistic scale.


1586
1:13:21,3 --> 1:13:24,4
When it was
a fully functioning
concentration camp,


1587
1:13:24,4 --> 1:13:27,2
Uh, what was
the purpose of it?


1588
1:13:27,2 --> 1:13:30,3
I mean, part of it
was to repress
political enemies.


1589
1:13:30,3 --> 1:13:32,3
What was the rest
of the purpose?


1590
1:13:32,3 --> 1:13:34,9
Well, beyond the repression
of the political enemies,


1591
1:13:34,9 --> 1:13:36,8
Which was its purpose
at the very beginning,


1592
1:13:36,8 --> 1:13:40,7
Then later on it transformed
into repressing racial enemies.


1593
1:13:40,7 --> 1:13:42,9
And sometimes
those categories overlapped


1594
1:13:42,9 --> 1:13:44,3
Because sometimes
they thought


1595
1:13:44,3 --> 1:13:46,5
That these people
were political enemies


1596
1:13:46,5 --> 1:13:48,7
Because they were
inferior biologically.


1597
1:13:48,7 --> 1:13:50,2
The war itself
was part of


1598
1:13:50,2 --> 1:13:52,9
The darwinian struggle
for existence, for hitler.


1599
1:13:52,9 --> 1:13:55,1
And he saw that
extermination of the jews


1600
1:13:55,1 --> 1:13:59,3
As one of those fronts
to this warfare going on,


1601
1:13:59,3 --> 1:14:2,1
As this darwinian struggle
for existence.


1602
1:14:2,1 --> 1:14:4,3
Would you say
that hitler was insane?


1603
1:14:4,3 --> 1:14:6,0
No, I wouldn't say
he was insane.


1604
1:14:6,0 --> 1:14:11,9
I think he had imbibed
some very, very wrong ideas,


1605
1:14:11,9 --> 1:14:13,1
And, in fact, I think


1606
1:14:13,1 --> 1:14:17,5
He took the logic of them
in certain ways


1607
1:14:17,5 --> 1:14:21,3
That brought
him to take


1608
1:14:21,3 --> 1:14:25,8
Very radical solutions
for them.


1609
1:14:25,8 --> 1:14:27,5
Would you say
he was evil?


1610
1:14:27,5 --> 1:14:28,9
Oh, i'd definitely say
he was evil.


1611
1:14:28,9 --> 1:14:30,5
Is there such
a thing as evil?


1612
1:14:30,5 --> 1:14:31,6
Oh, I think there is.


1613
1:14:31,6 --> 1:14:33,4
And is there such
a thing as good?


1614
1:14:33,4 --> 1:14:34,9
Oh, definitely.


1615
1:14:34,9 --> 1:14:39,7
And...Evil can sometimes
be rationalized as science.


1616
1:14:39,7 --> 1:14:40,7
Oh, sure.


1617
1:14:40,7 --> 1:14:42,5
And evil can sometimes
be rationalized--


1618
1:14:42,5 --> 1:14:44,0
When it's rationalized
as science,


1619
1:14:44,0 --> 1:14:46,5
And I think
when it was rationalized
in this particular way,


1620
1:14:46,5 --> 1:14:48,2
I think hitler thought
he was doing good.


1621
1:14:48,2 --> 1:14:49,4
He thought
he was doing good?


1622
1:14:49,4 --> 1:14:50,5
Oh, I think so.


1623
1:14:50,5 --> 1:14:52,6
He thought he was
benefiting humanity


1624
1:14:52,6 --> 1:14:54,4
By driving evolution
forward


1625
1:14:54,4 --> 1:15:4,8
And creating
a better humanity.


1626
1:15:4,8 --> 1:15:6,7
Before leaving dachau,


1627
1:15:6,7 --> 1:15:8,5
I stopped by the memorial


1628
1:15:8,5 --> 1:15:10,7
Commemorating
the thousands of jews


1629
1:15:10,7 --> 1:15:16,5
Who were killed there
in excruciating conditions.


1630
1:15:16,5 --> 1:15:18,2
I know that darwinism


1631
1:15:18,2 --> 1:15:21,4
Does not automatically
equate to nazism.


1632
1:15:21,4 --> 1:15:24,3
But if darwinism
inspired and justified


1633
1:15:24,3 --> 1:15:26,4
Such horrific events
in the past,


1634
1:15:26,4 --> 1:15:28,0
Could it be used
to rationalize


1635
1:15:28,0 --> 1:15:30,4
Similar initiatives today?


1636
1:15:30,4 --> 1:15:33,3
There's a good
german expression,
"so faengt es immer an."


1637
1:15:33,3 --> 1:15:35,6
I mean, "always begins
in the same way,"


1638
1:15:35,6 --> 1:15:37,4
Something to remember
in the context of


1639
1:15:37,4 --> 1:15:40,1
The united states' discussions
of euthanasia and abortion.


1640
1:15:40,1 --> 1:15:41,4
It always begins
in the same way.


1641
1:15:41,4 --> 1:15:43,6
There seems to be
an excellent argument


1642
1:15:43,6 --> 1:15:46,4
For getting rid
of useless people
by killing them.


1643
1:15:46,4 --> 1:15:47,7
Or at least
it seems excellent


1644
1:15:47,7 --> 1:15:49,9
To the people
advancing the argument.


1645
1:15:49,9 --> 1:15:51,4
It's the love affair
with death


1646
1:15:51,4 --> 1:15:53,9
And, you know, the euthanasia
and this movement going on,


1647
1:15:53,9 --> 1:15:55,0
Which I find appalling.


1648
1:15:55,0 --> 1:15:56,5
And the idea is that,
you know,


1649
1:15:56,5 --> 1:15:58,1
Immediately rid our society


1650
1:15:58,1 --> 1:15:59,9
Of anybody
who might be a drain


1651
1:15:59,9 --> 1:16:3,1
And think of people
in economic terms,


1652
1:16:3,1 --> 1:16:6,0
And I think that's
where some of the darwin
fits in, actually.


1653
1:16:6,0 --> 1:16:8,2
It's just a devaluing
of human life.


1654
1:16:8,2 --> 1:16:10,1
First of all,
if you take seriously


1655
1:16:10,1 --> 1:16:11,9
That evolution
has to do with


1656
1:16:11,9 --> 1:16:14,1
The transition
of life forms


1657
1:16:14,1 --> 1:16:17,1
And that life and death
are just natural processes,


1658
1:16:17,1 --> 1:16:20,5
Then one gets to be liberal
about abortion and euthanasia.


1659
1:16:20,5 --> 1:16:22,3
All of those kinds of ideas,


1660
1:16:22,3 --> 1:16:24,3
Seem to me, follow
very naturally


1661
1:16:24,3 --> 1:16:26,2
From a darwinian
perspective,


1662
1:16:26,2 --> 1:16:28,9
A de-privileging
of human beings,
basically.


1663
1:16:28,9 --> 1:16:32,4
And I think that people
who want to endorse darwinism


1664
1:16:32,4 --> 1:16:35,8
Have to sort of take
this kind of viewpoint
very seriously.


1665
1:16:35,8 --> 1:16:39,1
And when we see an elite--
and it is an elite--


1666
1:16:39,1 --> 1:16:41,9
An elite that
controls essentially


1667
1:16:41,9 --> 1:16:44,1
All the research money
in science,


1668
1:16:44,1 --> 1:16:46,7
Saying, "there is no
such thing as moral truth;


1669
1:16:46,7 --> 1:16:49,6
Science will not be
related to religion."


1670
1:16:49,6 --> 1:16:51,5
I mean, it's essentially
official policy


1671
1:16:51,5 --> 1:16:53,4
Of the national academy
of science


1672
1:16:53,4 --> 1:16:56,1
That religion and science
will not be related.


1673
1:16:56,1 --> 1:17:0,0
I mean, hey, that cuts off
a lot of debate, doesn't it?


1674
1:17:0,0 --> 1:17:2,4
What's going to happen
if this doesn't change?


1675
1:17:2,4 --> 1:17:4,7
I think we're watching
it happen, aren't we?


1676
1:17:4,7 --> 1:17:6,7
I needed time to think,


1677
1:17:6,7 --> 1:18:5,2
So I traveled
to the birthplace
of this idea.


1678
1:18:5,2 --> 1:18:8,5
"with savages,
the weak in body or mind


1679
1:18:8,5 --> 1:18:10,3
"are soon eliminated.


1680
1:18:10,3 --> 1:18:13,0
"we civilized men,
on the other hand,


1681
1:18:13,0 --> 1:18:16,7
"do our utmost to check
the process of elimination.


1682
1:18:16,7 --> 1:18:20,9
"we build asylums
for the imbecile,
the maimed, and the sick.


1683
1:18:20,9 --> 1:18:23,7
"thus the weak members
of civilized societies


1684
1:18:23,7 --> 1:18:25,5
"propagate their kind.


1685
1:18:25,5 --> 1:18:27,7
"no one who has attended
to the breeding


1686
1:18:27,7 --> 1:18:29,0
"of domestic animals


1687
1:18:29,0 --> 1:18:31,5
"will doubt that this
must be highly injurious


1688
1:18:31,5 --> 1:18:33,3
"to the race of man.


1689
1:18:33,3 --> 1:18:35,4
"hardly anyone
is so ignorant


1690
1:18:35,4 --> 1:18:38,6
As to allow
his worst animals to breed."


1691
1:18:38,6 --> 1:20:16,5
--charles darwin,
the descent of man, 1871.


1692
1:20:16,5 --> 1:20:25,0
[church bells tolling]


1693
1:20:25,0 --> 1:20:26,8
Meyer: throughout
the cold war in germany,


1694
1:20:26,8 --> 1:20:29,5
There was this wall erected
to keep ideas out.


1695
1:20:29,5 --> 1:20:32,1
It was erected by people
who held an ideology,


1696
1:20:32,1 --> 1:20:34,6
That were afraid
of a competition


1697
1:20:34,6 --> 1:20:38,8
From other ideas
that would come
into their society.


1698
1:20:38,8 --> 1:20:41,4
And what we're seeing
happening in science today


1699
1:20:41,4 --> 1:20:43,0
Is very much like that.


1700
1:20:43,0 --> 1:20:44,7
But I think that's
just a strategy


1701
1:20:44,7 --> 1:20:48,9
For protecting
a failing ideology
from competition.


1702
1:20:48,9 --> 1:20:51,1
America didn't become
the great nation that it is


1703
1:20:51,1 --> 1:20:52,9
By suppressing ideas.


1704
1:20:52,9 --> 1:20:56,0
It progressed
by allowing freedom of speech


1705
1:20:56,0 --> 1:20:58,7
And freedom of inquiry.


1706
1:20:58,7 --> 1:21:1,3
Thomas jefferson
got it right when he wrote,


1707
1:21:1,3 --> 1:21:3,8
"we hold these truths
to be self-evident,


1708
1:21:3,8 --> 1:21:6,2
"that all men
are created equal,


1709
1:21:6,2 --> 1:21:8,4
"that they are endowed
by their creator


1710
1:21:8,4 --> 1:21:10,6
"with certain
unalienable rights,


1711
1:21:10,6 --> 1:21:12,9
"that among these
are life, liberty,


1712
1:21:12,9 --> 1:21:15,1
And the pursuit
of happiness."


1713
1:21:15,1 --> 1:21:17,7
Hundreds of thousands
of americans


1714
1:21:17,7 --> 1:21:20,8
Have given their lives
to protect these values,


1715
1:21:20,8 --> 1:21:23,8
But now they're
under threat once again.


1716
1:21:23,8 --> 1:21:26,7
It wasn't just scientists
who were being expelled.


1717
1:21:26,7 --> 1:21:28,3
It was freedom itself,


1718
1:21:28,3 --> 1:21:31,0
The very foundation
of the american dream,


1719
1:21:31,0 --> 1:21:34,1
The very foundation
of america.


1720
1:21:34,1 --> 1:21:36,5
If we allowed freedom
to be expelled in science,


1721
1:21:36,5 --> 1:21:38,8
Where would it end?


1722
1:21:38,8 --> 1:21:40,8
The darwinian establishment


1723
1:21:40,8 --> 1:21:43,2
Is so massive
and so entrenched


1724
1:21:43,2 --> 1:21:45,2
It appears impenetrable.


1725
1:21:45,2 --> 1:21:47,3
I couldn't bring it down
myself,


1726
1:21:47,3 --> 1:21:48,9
But I could at least confront


1727
1:21:48,9 --> 1:21:53,8
Those who'd expelled
the scientists i'd met.


1728
1:21:53,8 --> 1:21:57,3
What would you say
if you had eugenie scott
sitting next to you?


1729
1:21:57,3 --> 1:21:58,5
What would you say to her?


1730
1:21:58,5 --> 1:22:1,6
I would ask her
by what authority


1731
1:22:1,6 --> 1:22:3,9
Does she
and those like her


1732
1:22:3,9 --> 1:22:6,2
Presume to declare


1733
1:22:6,2 --> 1:22:9,0
What is
and is not science.


1734
1:22:9,0 --> 1:22:11,5
He's sort of made himself
martyr of the day.


1735
1:22:11,5 --> 1:22:13,3
They've gotten a lot
of mileage out of,


1736
1:22:13,3 --> 1:22:16,2
You know,
poor rick sternberg.


1737
1:22:16,2 --> 1:22:17,4
And we got lip service


1738
1:22:17,4 --> 1:22:19,8
From the leadership
of the smithsonian,


1739
1:22:19,8 --> 1:22:22,4
But I didn't feel they
ever followed through.


1740
1:22:22,4 --> 1:22:25,5
We went into the smithsonian
looking for answers,


1741
1:22:25,5 --> 1:22:28,9
But we ran
into the same stone wall
as congressman souder.


1742
1:22:28,9 --> 1:22:31,1
You're not authorized
to do this here, so stop.


1743
1:22:31,1 --> 1:22:38,6
[overlapping chatter]


1744
1:22:38,6 --> 1:22:40,7
He said, "nonetheless,
you have to be disciplined,"


1745
1:22:40,7 --> 1:22:42,1
And I lost my job.


1746
1:22:42,1 --> 1:22:43,8
We did get an interview


1747
1:22:43,8 --> 1:22:46,0
With a spokesman
from george mason,


1748
1:22:46,0 --> 1:22:49,0
But it was impossible
to knock him off his script.


1749
1:22:49,0 --> 1:22:51,9
Her contract
was not renewed.


1750
1:22:51,9 --> 1:22:55,3
It was simply, um,
not renewing her contract,


1751
1:22:55,3 --> 1:22:56,8
Which she satisfied.


1752
1:22:56,8 --> 1:22:59,0
Her contract
was not renewed.


1753
1:22:59,0 --> 1:23:1,9
It had nothing to do
with the controversy


1754
1:23:1,9 --> 1:23:7,6
Of that topic
of intelligent design.


1755
1:23:7,6 --> 1:23:11,4
I have never been treated
like this in my--


1756
1:23:11,4 --> 1:23:13,6
About 30 years in academia.


1757
1:23:13,6 --> 1:23:17,4
We received
a similar reception
at baylor university.


1758
1:23:17,4 --> 1:23:18,7
They refused to admit


1759
1:23:18,7 --> 1:23:20,5
That what had happened
to dr. Marks


1760
1:23:20,5 --> 1:23:22,9
Had anything to do
with id.


1761
1:23:22,9 --> 1:23:26,0
Certainly the conversations
i've had, this has not--


1762
1:23:26,0 --> 1:23:28,2
The intelligent design
situation


1763
1:23:28,2 --> 1:23:30,5
Has not been the thrust
of the conversation.


1764
1:23:30,5 --> 1:23:32,6
It was a procedural issue,


1765
1:23:32,6 --> 1:23:34,8
And that's the way
we dealt with it.


1766
1:23:34,8 --> 1:23:37,8
Funny, that's not
how dean kelley put things


1767
1:23:37,8 --> 1:23:46,2
In his original e-mail
to dr. Marks.


1768
1:23:46,2 --> 1:23:48,7
I'm not mixing my religion
with my science.


1769
1:23:48,7 --> 1:23:50,6
The questions that I ask


1770
1:23:50,6 --> 1:23:52,3
In my intelligent design
research


1771
1:23:52,3 --> 1:23:54,9
Are perfectly legitimate
scientific questions.


1772
1:23:54,9 --> 1:23:57,2
At least the top guns
at iowa state


1773
1:23:57,2 --> 1:23:59,7
Were willing to own up
to their actions.


1774
1:23:59,7 --> 1:24:2,9
What we wanted to stop is
the use of the name of isu


1775
1:24:2,9 --> 1:24:5,5
To validate
intelligent design.


1776
1:24:5,5 --> 1:24:7,1
And we did succeed.


1777
1:24:7,1 --> 1:24:9,8
I really think
a lot of guillermo.
He's a great guy.


1778
1:24:9,8 --> 1:24:11,9
So that's why i'm
kind of disappointed.


1779
1:24:11,9 --> 1:24:13,8
He should've just
left this alone,


1780
1:24:13,8 --> 1:24:15,9
In my opinion, should've
just left it alone.


1781
1:24:15,9 --> 1:24:18,1
Dr. Hauptman
elaborated further


1782
1:24:18,1 --> 1:24:20,8
On his great regard
for gonzalez.


1783
1:24:20,8 --> 1:24:23,8
Man: uh, this is quoting
an e-mail from you
to mr. Avalos.


1784
1:24:23,8 --> 1:24:28,7
You say, "sometimes
it is just best
to ignore idiots,"


1785
1:24:28,7 --> 1:24:31,5
In reference
to guillermo.


1786
1:24:31,5 --> 1:24:34,0
And then,
"the religious nutcases


1787
1:24:34,0 --> 1:24:36,1
Should be challenged
at every opportunity."


1788
1:24:36,1 --> 1:24:38,5
Yeah, because,
for example,


1789
1:24:38,5 --> 1:24:41,8
You--
[chuckles]


1790
1:24:41,8 --> 1:24:43,7
In that case,
i'm thinking more of,


1791
1:24:43,7 --> 1:24:46,6
Say, the creationist crowd,
who claims that God


1792
1:24:46,6 --> 1:24:49,3
Put all the animals
on an ark, and that's it.


1793
1:24:49,3 --> 1:24:51,9
That's where
all of our animals
came from today.


1794
1:24:51,9 --> 1:24:53,1
That's crazy, okay?


1795
1:24:53,1 --> 1:24:54,4
You shouldn't
be insulting


1796
1:24:54,4 --> 1:24:56,2
Even children with
that kind of thing.


1797
1:24:56,2 --> 1:24:58,1
So these are
the idiots, all right?


1798
1:24:58,1 --> 1:24:59,5
They've always been around.


1799
1:24:59,5 --> 1:25:1,7
They've always been around.


1800
1:25:1,7 --> 1:25:4,6
Going after the perpetrators
in each of these cases


1801
1:25:4,6 --> 1:25:6,8
Wasn't getting me anywhere.


1802
1:25:6,8 --> 1:25:10,4
So I reconnected
with dr. Berlinski
and dr. Schroeder


1803
1:25:10,4 --> 1:25:17,6
To see if they had
any advice.


1804
1:25:17,6 --> 1:25:19,3
Berlinski:
there's a boundary


1805
1:25:19,3 --> 1:25:21,5
To what science
will accept right now.


1806
1:25:21,5 --> 1:25:24,6
I think the parallel
is exactly this wall
coming down.


1807
1:25:24,6 --> 1:25:27,7
Ask any berliner
from the east side


1808
1:25:27,7 --> 1:25:30,5
What it meant
to have the wall come down.


1809
1:25:30,5 --> 1:25:35,0
If it is possible to make
a break in the wall,


1810
1:25:35,0 --> 1:25:37,3
That would allow academia


1811
1:25:37,3 --> 1:25:39,9
To ask these fundamental
questions that exist


1812
1:25:39,9 --> 1:25:45,6
And allow them
in the science classrooms
as well.


1813
1:25:45,6 --> 1:25:48,3
It'd be nice to see
the scientific establishment


1814
1:25:48,3 --> 1:25:50,0
Lose some of its
prestige and power.


1815
1:25:50,0 --> 1:25:52,9
It'd be nice to see
other questions
being opened up.


1816
1:25:52,9 --> 1:25:54,4
Above all,
it would be nice


1817
1:25:54,4 --> 1:25:57,2
To have a real spirit
of self-criticism


1818
1:25:57,2 --> 1:26:0,7
Penetrating
the sciences.


1819
1:26:0,7 --> 1:26:2,9
Stein: what can I do
to bring down the wall?


1820
1:26:2,9 --> 1:26:4,5
Is there anything
I can do?


1821
1:26:4,5 --> 1:26:6,2
Make it apparent
to the world


1822
1:26:6,2 --> 1:26:7,6
That a wall exists.


1823
1:26:7,6 --> 1:26:9,7
There are vast numbers
of persons


1824
1:26:9,7 --> 1:26:11,9
Who talk about
academic freedom,


1825
1:26:11,9 --> 1:26:14,3
And there is
academic freedom


1826
1:26:14,3 --> 1:26:17,1
As long as you're
on the correct side
of the wall.


1827
1:26:17,1 --> 1:26:19,4
But if you're
on the wrong side
of the wall,


1828
1:26:19,4 --> 1:26:20,7
As you mentioned
a few moments ago,


1829
1:26:20,7 --> 1:26:23,9
You lose tenure,
and that's a given.


1830
1:26:23,9 --> 1:26:27,0
I took dr. Schroeder's words
to heart.


1831
1:26:27,0 --> 1:26:30,0
Obviously I couldn't
take down the wall myself,


1832
1:26:30,0 --> 1:27:25,6
But I could confront
one of its modern architects.


1833
1:27:25,6 --> 1:27:28,5
Hello, professor dawkins.
How are you?


1834
1:27:28,5 --> 1:27:31,0
I'm ben stein,
i'm so sorry
to keep you waiting.


1835
1:27:31,0 --> 1:27:34,6
- how are you?
- fine, thank you.


1836
1:27:34,6 --> 1:27:36,6
You have--
you have written


1837
1:27:36,6 --> 1:27:39,1
That God is
a psychotic delinquent


1838
1:27:39,1 --> 1:27:41,8
Invented by mad,
deluded people.


1839
1:27:41,8 --> 1:27:43,1
No, I didn't say
quite that.


1840
1:27:43,1 --> 1:27:45,1
I said something
rather better than that.


1841
1:27:45,1 --> 1:27:47,5
Oh, well, please tell
us what you said.


1842
1:27:47,5 --> 1:27:49,8
Well, I would have
to read it from the book.


1843
1:27:49,8 --> 1:27:51,7
No, please.


1844
1:27:51,7 --> 1:27:53,0
"the God
of the old testament


1845
1:27:53,0 --> 1:27:55,4
"is arguably the most
unpleasant character


1846
1:27:55,4 --> 1:27:56,5
"in all fiction--


1847
1:27:56,5 --> 1:27:58,0
"jealous and proud of it,


1848
1:27:58,0 --> 1:28:1,2
"a petty, unjust,
unforgiving control freak,


1849
1:28:1,2 --> 1:28:3,8
"a vindictive, bloodthirsty
ethnic cleanser,


1850
1:28:3,8 --> 1:28:5,8
"a misogynistic,
homophobic,


1851
1:28:5,8 --> 1:28:9,2
"racist, infanticidal,
genocidal, filicidal,


1852
1:28:9,2 --> 1:28:11,4
"pestilential,
megalomaniacal,


1853
1:28:11,4 --> 1:28:12,7
"sadomasochistic,


1854
1:28:12,7 --> 1:28:14,8
Capriciously
malevolent bully."


1855
1:28:14,8 --> 1:28:16,8
- so that's
what you think of God.
- yeah.


1856
1:28:16,8 --> 1:28:18,7
How about if people
believed in a God


1857
1:28:18,7 --> 1:28:21,1
Of infinite lovingness
and kindness


1858
1:28:21,1 --> 1:28:23,7
And forgiveness
and generosity,


1859
1:28:23,7 --> 1:28:26,0
Sort of like
the modern-day God.


1860
1:28:26,0 --> 1:28:28,8
Why spoil it for them?


1861
1:28:28,8 --> 1:28:32,4
- oh, um--
- why not just let them
have their fun and enjoy it?


1862
1:28:32,4 --> 1:28:35,0
I don't want to spoil
anything for anybody.


1863
1:28:35,0 --> 1:28:37,8
I write a book.
People can read it
if they want to.


1864
1:28:37,8 --> 1:28:41,2
I believe that it is
a liberating thing


1865
1:28:41,2 --> 1:28:45,3
To free yourself
from primitive superstition.


1866
1:28:45,3 --> 1:28:46,9
So religion's
a primitive superstition?


1867
1:28:46,9 --> 1:28:48,5
Oh, I think it is, yes.


1868
1:28:48,5 --> 1:28:51,0
So, uh, you believe
it's liberating


1869
1:28:51,0 --> 1:28:53,8
To tell people
that there is no God.


1870
1:28:53,8 --> 1:28:56,3
I think a lot of people,
when they give up God,


1871
1:28:56,3 --> 1:29:0,2
Feel a great sense
of release and freedom.


1872
1:29:0,2 --> 1:29:1,8
Why do you think that?


1873
1:29:1,8 --> 1:29:4,5
- you're a scientist.
What's your data?
- well, I...


1874
1:29:4,5 --> 1:29:6,9
Well, i've had a lot
of letters saying that.


1875
1:29:6,9 --> 1:29:9,1
There're eight billion people
in the world, dr. Dawkins.


1876
1:29:9,1 --> 1:29:10,1
Yeah, I know,
I know...


1877
1:29:10,1 --> 1:29:11,7
How many letters
have you had?


1878
1:29:11,7 --> 1:29:13,7
No, I--
that's quite true.


1879
1:29:13,7 --> 1:29:17,7
Professor dawkins
seemed so convinced
that God doesn't exist


1880
1:29:17,7 --> 1:29:20,7
That I wondered if he
would be willing to put
a number on it.


1881
1:29:20,7 --> 1:29:22,8
Well, it's hard to put
a figure on it,


1882
1:29:22,8 --> 1:29:25,0
But i'd put it
as something like,


1883
1:29:25,0 --> 1:29:27,5
You know, 99% against
or something--


1884
1:29:27,5 --> 1:29:30,4
Well, how do you know
it's 99% and not, say, 97%?


1885
1:29:30,4 --> 1:29:32,9
I don't. You asked me
to put a figure on it,


1886
1:29:32,9 --> 1:29:35,7
And i'm not comfortable
putting a figure on it.


1887
1:29:35,7 --> 1:29:38,8
I think it's--
I just think it's
very unlikely.


1888
1:29:38,8 --> 1:29:41,3
But you couldn't put
a number on it.


1889
1:29:41,3 --> 1:29:42,2
No, of course not.


1890
1:29:42,2 --> 1:29:44,2
So it could be 49%.


1891
1:29:44,2 --> 1:29:48,5
Well, it would be--
I mean, I think it's unlikely,


1892
1:29:48,5 --> 1:29:51,7
And it's quite far
from 50%.


1893
1:29:51,7 --> 1:29:53,1
How do you know?


1894
1:29:53,1 --> 1:29:54,1
I don't know.


1895
1:29:54,1 --> 1:29:56,9
I mean, I put
an argument in the book.


1896
1:29:56,9 --> 1:29:58,5
Then who did create
the heavens and the earth?


1897
1:29:58,5 --> 1:29:59,8
Why do you use
the word "who?"


1898
1:29:59,8 --> 1:30:1,6
You see,
you immediately beg
the question


1899
1:30:1,6 --> 1:30:3,0
By using the word "who."


1900
1:30:3,0 --> 1:30:5,6
Then how did
it get created?


1901
1:30:5,6 --> 1:30:9,9
Well, um...
By a very slow process.


1902
1:30:9,9 --> 1:30:11,1
Well, how did it start?


1903
1:30:11,1 --> 1:30:13,2
Nobody knows
how it got started.


1904
1:30:13,2 --> 1:30:15,3
We know the kind of event
that it must've been.


1905
1:30:15,3 --> 1:30:17,4
We know the sort of event
that must've happened


1906
1:30:17,4 --> 1:30:19,2
- for the origin of life.
- what was that?


1907
1:30:19,2 --> 1:30:23,3
It was the origin of the first
self-replicating molecule.


1908
1:30:23,3 --> 1:30:25,1
Right, and how did
that happen?


1909
1:30:25,1 --> 1:30:27,3
I've told you,
we don't know.


1910
1:30:27,3 --> 1:30:29,4
So you have no idea
how it started?


1911
1:30:29,4 --> 1:30:31,4
No, no.
Nor has anybody.


1912
1:30:31,4 --> 1:30:32,4
Nor has anyone else.


1913
1:30:32,4 --> 1:30:34,2
What do you think
is the possibility


1914
1:30:34,2 --> 1:30:35,7
That intelligent design


1915
1:30:35,7 --> 1:30:37,3
Might turn out to be


1916
1:30:37,3 --> 1:30:40,2
The answer to some
issues in genetics


1917
1:30:40,2 --> 1:30:42,5
Or in evolution?


1918
1:30:42,5 --> 1:30:44,6
It could come about
in the following way.


1919
1:30:44,6 --> 1:30:48,4
It could be that
at some earlier time,


1920
1:30:48,4 --> 1:30:49,9
Somewhere in the universe,


1921
1:30:49,9 --> 1:30:53,1
A civilization evolved


1922
1:30:53,1 --> 1:30:55,6
By probably some kind
of darwinian means


1923
1:30:55,6 --> 1:30:58,5
To a very, very high level
of technology


1924
1:30:58,5 --> 1:31:0,8
And designed
a form of life


1925
1:31:0,8 --> 1:31:3,6
That they seeded onto,
perhaps, this planet.


1926
1:31:3,6 --> 1:31:9,4
Now, that is a possibility
and an intriguing possibility,


1927
1:31:9,4 --> 1:31:12,0
And I suppose it's possible
that you might find
evidence for that.


1928
1:31:12,0 --> 1:31:15,6
If you look
at the detail--


1929
1:31:15,6 --> 1:31:18,3
Details of biochemistry,
molecular biology,


1930
1:31:18,3 --> 1:31:21,6
You might find a signature
of some sort of designer.


1931
1:31:21,6 --> 1:31:22,9
Wait a second.


1932
1:31:22,9 --> 1:31:25,7
Richard dawkins
thought intelligent design


1933
1:31:25,7 --> 1:31:27,6
Might be
a legitimate pursuit?


1934
1:31:27,6 --> 1:31:31,7
And that designer
could well be
a higher intelligence


1935
1:31:31,7 --> 1:31:34,4
From elsewhere
in the universe.


1936
1:31:34,4 --> 1:31:36,0
- well--
- but that higher
intelligence


1937
1:31:36,0 --> 1:31:38,4
Would itself have had
to have come about


1938
1:31:38,4 --> 1:31:42,6
By some explicable
or ultimately
explicable process.


1939
1:31:42,6 --> 1:31:46,3
It couldn't have just jumped
into existence spontaneously.
That's the point.


1940
1:31:46,3 --> 1:31:51,0
So professor dawkins
was not against
intelligent design,


1941
1:31:51,0 --> 1:31:53,7
Just certain types
of designers,


1942
1:31:53,7 --> 1:31:55,7
Such as God.


1943
1:31:55,7 --> 1:31:57,3
So the hebrew God,


1944
1:31:57,3 --> 1:31:58,8
The God of
the old testament--


1945
1:31:58,8 --> 1:32:1,1
He doesn't exist
in your view?


1946
1:32:1,1 --> 1:32:2,9
Uh, certainly.


1947
1:32:2,9 --> 1:32:5,8
I mean, that would be
a very unpleasant prospect.


1948
1:32:5,8 --> 1:32:8,0
And the holy trinity
of the new testament--


1949
1:32:8,0 --> 1:32:9,6
No, nothing like that.


1950
1:32:9,6 --> 1:32:13,3
Do you believe
in any of the hindu Gods?


1951
1:32:13,3 --> 1:32:15,2
- like vishnu?
- how can you ask
such a question?


1952
1:32:15,2 --> 1:32:16,3
- you don't, right?
- how could I?


1953
1:32:16,3 --> 1:32:17,5
I mean, why would I,


1954
1:32:17,5 --> 1:32:19,1
Given that I don't believe
in any others?


1955
1:32:19,1 --> 1:32:20,5
You don't believe
in the moslem God.


1956
1:32:20,5 --> 1:32:24,1
No. Why do you
even need to ask?


1957
1:32:24,1 --> 1:32:25,6
I just wanted
to be sure.


1958
1:32:25,6 --> 1:32:29,4
So you don't believe
in any God anywhere.


1959
1:32:29,4 --> 1:32:32,9
Any God anywhere
would be completely
incompatible


1960
1:32:32,9 --> 1:32:37,8
With--with anything
that i've said in--


1961
1:32:37,8 --> 1:32:40,4
I assumed, I just
wanted to make sure


1962
1:32:40,4 --> 1:32:42,6
You don't believe
in any God anywhere.


1963
1:32:42,6 --> 1:32:45,7
- no.
- what if after you died,
you ran into God.


1964
1:32:45,7 --> 1:32:48,1
He said, "what have
you been doing, richard?


1965
1:32:48,1 --> 1:32:49,4
"I mean, what have
you been doing?


1966
1:32:49,4 --> 1:32:50,9
"i've been trying
to be nice to you.


1967
1:32:50,9 --> 1:32:53,9
"I gave you
a multimillion-dollar
paycheck


1968
1:32:53,9 --> 1:32:55,9
"over and over again
with your book,


1969
1:32:55,9 --> 1:32:57,4
And look what you did."


1970
1:32:57,4 --> 1:32:59,9
Bertram russell
had that point put to him,


1971
1:32:59,9 --> 1:33:2,3
And he said
something like,


1972
1:33:2,3 --> 1:33:9,6
"sir, why did you take such
pains to hide yourself?"


1973
1:33:9,6 --> 1:33:12,8
But if the intelligent design
people are right,


1974
1:33:12,8 --> 1:33:14,6
God isn't hidden.


1975
1:33:14,6 --> 1:33:18,1
We may even be able to
encounter God through science


1976
1:33:18,1 --> 1:33:21,4
If we have the freedom
to go there.


1977
1:33:21,4 --> 1:33:28,7
What could be
more intriguing than that?


1978
1:33:28,7 --> 1:33:31,4
[at podium]
we take freedom for granted


1979
1:33:31,4 --> 1:33:33,4
Here in the United States.


1980
1:33:33,4 --> 1:33:37,7
Freedom is what
this country is all about.


1981
1:33:37,7 --> 1:33:41,6
And a huge part of freedom
is freedom of inquiry.


1982
1:33:41,6 --> 1:33:43,7
But now,
i'm sorry to say,


1983
1:33:43,7 --> 1:33:47,4
Freedom of inquiry in science
is being suppressed.


1984
1:33:47,4 --> 1:33:49,7
Behind me stands a wall


1985
1:33:49,7 --> 1:33:53,4
That encircles
the free sectors of this city,


1986
1:33:53,4 --> 1:33:56,7
Part of a vast system
of barriers.


1987
1:33:56,7 --> 1:33:58,0
There are people
out there


1988
1:33:58,0 --> 1:34:0,3
Who want to keep science
in a little box


1989
1:34:0,3 --> 1:34:3,4
Where it can't possibly touch
a higher power,


1990
1:34:3,4 --> 1:34:5,8
Cannot possibly touch God.


1991
1:34:5,8 --> 1:34:7,8
Those barriers
cut across germany


1992
1:34:7,8 --> 1:34:9,9
In a gash of barbed wire,


1993
1:34:9,9 --> 1:34:14,3
Concrete, dog runs,
and guard towers.


1994
1:34:14,3 --> 1:34:15,8
If you believe in God


1995
1:34:15,8 --> 1:34:17,3
And you believe
that there is


1996
1:34:17,3 --> 1:34:19,1
An intrinsic order
in the universe


1997
1:34:19,1 --> 1:34:21,3
And you believe that
it's the role of science


1998
1:34:21,3 --> 1:34:24,3
To try to pursue
and understand better
that order,


1999
1:34:24,3 --> 1:34:26,8
You will be ostracized.


2000
1:34:26,8 --> 1:34:29,2
I'm frightened by this,


2001
1:34:29,2 --> 1:34:30,8
But i'm not going
to let it stop me


2002
1:34:30,8 --> 1:34:32,7
From investigating
or from speaking.


2003
1:34:32,7 --> 1:34:36,9
The wall cannot withstand
freedom.


2004
1:34:36,9 --> 1:34:39,7
What i'm asking for
is the freedom


2005
1:34:39,7 --> 1:34:44,1
To follow the evidence
wherever it leads.


2006
1:34:44,1 --> 1:34:45,7
My hope is that
there'll be enough


2007
1:34:45,7 --> 1:34:47,4
Independent-thinking
scientists


2008
1:34:47,4 --> 1:34:49,9
Who don't like to be
told what to think.


2009
1:34:49,9 --> 1:34:52,2
People on both sides
of the argument


2010
1:34:52,2 --> 1:34:55,3
Being prepared
to talk and listen,


2011
1:34:55,3 --> 1:34:57,1
And, above all,
a willingness


2012
1:34:57,1 --> 1:34:59,0
To keep
these dialogues open.


2013
1:34:59,0 --> 1:35:2,7
It might allow a lot
of very good scientists


2014
1:35:2,7 --> 1:35:4,1
To be scientists,


2015
1:35:4,1 --> 1:35:6,7
Who aren't allowed
to be scientists right now.


2016
1:35:6,7 --> 1:35:9,0
I don't care what they
end up as being.


2017
1:35:9,0 --> 1:35:11,1
I don't care if they
end up being religious


2018
1:35:11,1 --> 1:35:13,2
Or young-earth
creationists.


2019
1:35:13,2 --> 1:35:14,8
If they have
thought their way


2020
1:35:14,8 --> 1:35:16,7
Through the issues
and get there,


2021
1:35:16,7 --> 1:35:18,6
I'm all for them.


2022
1:35:18,6 --> 1:35:21,2
And why do I think
we're going to win
in this struggle?


2023
1:35:21,2 --> 1:35:24,1
Because truth crushed
to earth will rise again.


2024
1:35:24,1 --> 1:35:27,0
To find out what's true
has a value all of its own.


2025
1:35:27,0 --> 1:35:30,7
If it has additional
good consequences, so be it.


2026
1:35:30,7 --> 1:35:33,1
Because no lie
can live forever.


2027
1:35:33,1 --> 1:35:36,1
I believe that science
gives us one perspective
on the world,


2028
1:35:36,1 --> 1:35:38,9
And our religious insight
gives us another perspective
on the world.


2029
1:35:38,9 --> 1:35:40,4
By putting the two together,


2030
1:35:40,4 --> 1:35:43,1
Then we'll see
more deeply and more truly.


2031
1:35:43,1 --> 1:35:45,5
And if we will stand up
for freedom...


2032
1:35:45,5 --> 1:35:48,2
Freedom is the victor.


2033
1:35:48,2 --> 1:35:51,5
If we all do that,
we will overcome.


2034
1:35:51,5 --> 1:35:55,3
[the killer's "all these things
that i've done" plays]


2035
1:35:55,3 --> 1:35:56,9
[audience applauding]


2036
1:35:56,9 --> 1:36:0,6
 all these things
that i've done 


2037
1:36:0,6 --> 1:36:5,3
 yeah, you're gonna bring
yourself down 


2038
1:36:5,3 --> 1:36:11,3
 yeah, you're gonna bring
yourself down 


2039
1:36:11,3 --> 1:36:13,0
I've taken a first step


2040
1:36:13,0 --> 1:36:15,1
By speaking out
on this issue.


2041
1:36:15,1 --> 1:36:17,0
But if the wall
is to come down,


2042
1:36:17,0 --> 1:36:18,8
We all have to do our part.


2043
1:36:18,8 --> 1:36:21,7
Some of you
will pay a heavy price
for speaking out.


2044
1:36:21,7 --> 1:36:23,8
You may even lose your job.


2045
1:36:23,8 --> 1:36:26,9
I guarantee you
you'll get hate e-mail.


2046
1:36:26,9 --> 1:36:29,0
But if you don't
get involved,


2047
1:36:29,0 --> 1:36:32,7
Will anyone be left
to carry on the struggle?


2048
1:36:32,7 --> 1:36:33,7
Anyone?


2049
1:36:33,7 --> 1:36:37,8
Anyone?


2050
1:36:37,8 --> 1:36:42,3
 I got soul,
but i'm not a soldier 


2051
1:36:42,3 --> 1:36:46,3
 I got soul,
but i'm not a soldier 


2052
1:36:46,3 --> 1:36:50,5
 I got soul,
but i'm not a soldier 


2053
1:36:50,5 --> 1:36:54,8
 I got soul,
but i'm not a soldier 


2054
1:36:54,8 --> 1:37:7,9
 I got soul,
but i'm not a soldier 


2055
1:37:7,9 --> 1:37:12,2
 yeah, you know
you got to help me out 


2056
1:37:12,2 --> 1:37:17,9
 yeah, oh don't you put me
on the back burner 


2057
1:37:17,9 --> 1:37:20,7
 you know
you got to help me out 


2058
1:37:20,7 --> 1:37:24,6
 yeah, you're gonna bring
yourself down 


2059
1:37:24,6 --> 1:37:29,2
 yeah, you're gonna bring
yourself down 


2060
1:37:29,2 --> 1:37:34,6
 yeah, oh don't you put me
on the back burner 


2061
1:37:34,6 --> 1:37:37,3
 you're gonna bring
yourself down 


2062
1:37:37,3 --> 1:37:41,3
 yeah, you're gonna bring
yourself down 


2063
1:37:41,3 --> 1:37:45,9
 over and in 


2064
1:37:45,9 --> 1:37:49,6
 last call for sin 


2065
1:37:49,6 --> 1:37:54,0
 while everyone's lost,
the battle is won 


2066
1:37:54,0 --> 1:39:54,0
 with all these things
that i've done
