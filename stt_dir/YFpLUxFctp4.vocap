###0 grandpa has been in the east side of it being the and i think it's pretty
###3 obvious winemakers you know arrive forty sixteen
###6 and he's a native ron on the platform the a libertarian who
###11 who uh... respects people's individual rights that's why did you know outfits
###15 from now
###16 on the rights of a number of issues and uh... one of the main issue based on the
###20 come on the right side is civil liberties of course that film strikes at
###24 as opposition to the confirmation of uh... of bread
###27 uh... in arizona talk about sal
###30 the about
###31 the g_o_p_ an evangelical being to deter
###34 to go to war
###36 i'd like to hear
###37 i think that it is important that what we talk about war
###42 that i think part of republicans problems and frankly it a true some in
###46 the evangelical christian movement i think it appeared to be here for war
###50 i tell them you know when i read the new testament and when i read about jesus i
###54 don't see men being involved he was really involved with the war of his days
###58 in fact people rebuked him for not being the king they wanted they wanted
###62 somebody stand up to the romans
###64 blessed are the peacemakers not listed on the war makers
###68 that is about four hours
###70 i did not see that coming did you think you're going to do that i was gonna be
###72 some lip service he but right at them and use their own uh... bible against
###76 them it sounds just rational enough to eliminate any chance he has a huge
###80 kicking out and
###83 yes that's the only reason tracklisting do you start going its own writings
###87 chances those rationale is he doing that financial reports did when he was in the
###91 dates
###91 and i remember watching it missed before i get really political river him saying
###96 line against nation building outside what is even talking about
###99 take a look it up but that meant and of course as soon as he became president he
###102 started nation building so is this that
###104 i'm going to make uh... plead to the moderates on the libertarians out there
###108 to make them think i'm not a war monger then as soon as he becomes president of
###111 a war monger
###112 added up the estate
###114 aramony's seems to me that catalyst your desire to lose the magellan also their
###118 vote for it offered as opposed to the reporting
###122 soul maybe he's doing that they will restrain you get the middle to come
###125 what regarding the presidency has captured by military vessel
###130 yeah it was as a democrat
###131 republican
###132 or maybe even a bit the libertarian i don't know uh...
###135 they're good war monger hazardous so much money the
###139 today
###140 yes uh... with escaping it
###142 uh... with with ron paul on this issue
###146 uh... at least easily get allot of sympathy
###149 everyone because who is really fear of the warranty other that those were were
###154 permitted to making money on that
###156 and how still he's approx removes cell
###161 dollars so maybe you want to the campaign contributions
###164 but he would get uh... support from republicans issue
###167 and i think
###169 uh... he's reposition himself
###170 pretty well because
###172 just in terms of style as appearance
###176 his dad kar raha seemed a little bit
###179 uh... means losing presidential directly since he was a small blouses for us to
###185 package whatever it is the susie you happiest of people into some of them
###189 program policies
###191 livermore livermore brother prosperity and if you can't just say about saint
###195 james' steam yet
###197 perhaps the middle
###198 to cometh inside
###200 had a remarkable work there is a franchise with the government could like
###202 people like me compensate for the government
###205 i'm sick of uh... the democrats
###208 increase you mean this plot
###210 government that we have whatever the problem and and samson yes
###214 uh... that we can't even on an issue where ninety percent of the american
###217 people are for like backwards
###219 we're not gonna get a because reno we live in a blue talk with the right this
###223 is one of the talk was it looks like ladies and gentlemen one the american
###226 people overwhelmingly want something and they don't get why because
###230 there's a handful of people with money you don't want a and that's it
###234 philosophically manholes
###236 striking the right time to reposition himself well
###239 now is a reading stories playing i think in twenty sixteen an
###242 who knows practical
###245 pride when that battle anyway
###247 i think he's
###248 the smart about it
###250 i'd like to strike at the center you know if i can assure disrespect in
###253 tennessee but i think that you might be interesting to groups their think that
###256 fishery that he
###257 would in some my pathetic will sense get the support it but one i think that you
###262 might be addressing the willingness of the republican base to be whipped up
###264 into a frenzy of fear over say iran may be in the next couple of years like they
###269 gathered or war now but i think that they can be convinced like a war in the
###272 next couple of years and also he will lose but he said the donors but he's
###276 also been a lose the media lately has already and from what i've seen a lot
###279 like krauthammer bill kristol things like that i think he's already lost
###282 foxnews and i think that in america for the most part another people support the
###287 people there told the support let me or twelve year old girl you like to pop
###290 stars are told like and when you are voting a republican nominating contest i
###294 think that you support the people you told the support
###296 i think that it'll be too easy for them the cast him as just as crazy as from
###300 paul in fox news over the course of next two years nude howard dean
###304 lot of people love them but they cast his grades aren't many losses on a
###308 supporter i was very easy when it is the military industrial complex and they got
###312 rid of them right away
###313 saying wait a bigotry eliot spitzer he went against wall street they got rid of
###317 him right away and he has every nefarious waiting given be they were
###320 using of the patriot act to get him for being in a person's unbelievable that is
###325 crazy will see it
###327 forty agree with the u_n_ and we'll see
###330 and i think what brand policy try to do is write you know circumvent all of that
###334 but directly to the people are saying
###338 that'll be democracy inaction but will see i but i think
###342 your largely correct that
###344 he doesn't have the donors he doesn't have fox news
###347 he can't win the nomination
