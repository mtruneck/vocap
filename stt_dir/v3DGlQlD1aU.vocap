###13 SIMON OSTROVSKY: We headed out in the morning to see if we
###15 could find some Jewish outposts in the West Bank,
###17 ones that were small, unestablished, and
###19 unauthorized.
###21 We decided to drive to Havat Gilad, which is known for
###24 having clashed with both its Palestinian neighbors as well
###27 as the Israeli Police force and the Army.
###30 Israel has a love/hate
###31 relationship with the settlers.
###33 Nearly 40% of Israelis think the settlers shouldn't be in
###36 the West Bank, but their views have never translated into
###40 government policy.
###41 And many blame this on the influence of extremist
###43 religious parties who believe that the Palestinian
###46 territories were promised to them by God.
###50 Israel's prime minister says he wants a two-state solution,
###53 but he's never actually said he wants to evacuate the
###55 settlements.
###56 And although he recently broke free of a coalition with the
###59 religious parties, he's still a strong supporter of the
###62 settlement enterprise.
###64 BENJAMIN NETANYAHU: [SPEAKING HEBREW]
###68 TRANSLATOR: There is no government that supports or
###70 will support settlements more than the government I lead.
###74 SIMON OSTROVSKY: This means Palestinians can expect more
###76 settler expansion and more attention with the Israelis
###80 and their army.
###81 And on our way to the settlement, we noticed a bit
###83 of a commotion involving a bunch of Palestinians and some
###86 Israeli soldiers.
###88 We saw off to the side of the road this group of
###89 Palestinians, but they're being watched over by Israeli
###93 security forces.
###94 So we're wondering what's going on here.
###96 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###97 
###118 SIMON OSTROVSKY: It turns out Israel had mobilized its army
###120 to allow an Israeli archaeological
###122 team to dig up a field.
###124 The Palestinian villagers weren't happy because they saw
###127 it as the first step in the expansion of a nearby
###129 settlement.
###130 This is totally crazy because this is an archaeological dig
###133 being carried out by the Israeli
###135 authorities in the West Bank.
###137 And this is how many soldiers you need in order to protect
###140 this archaeological excavation.
###142 But what's even more nuts is that Palestinians are doing
###145 the manual labor.
###146 So the Israelis have hired Palestinians to do an illegal
###149 excavation in the Palestinian territories.
###151 MALE SPEAKER:
###152 
###184 SIMON OSTROVSKY: What is this place?
###185 What is the significance of this site?
###189 But they're on the wrong side of the green line for doing
###192 archaeological digs.
###194 No?
###195 I mean I'm just asking if that's correct.
###197 MALE SPEAKER:
###199 SIMON OSTROVSKY: I don't know.
###200 I don't know.
###201 MALE SPEAKER: No picture today.
###204 SIMON OSTROVSKY: So the soldiers really didn't want me
###206 to talk to the Palestinians who are apparently upset about
###208 this archaeological dig taking place here.
###211 And the reason they're upset is because a lot of times when
###214 the Israelis do an archaeological dig, they then
###216 build a sort of memorial around any Jewish artifacts
###220 that they find.
###220 And it becomes a place of pilgrimage for the settlers
###223 who come here.
###223 And then, bit by bit, the Palestinians feel that they're
###227 losing even more land.
###228 It turns out the guy who was leading the excavation, and
###231 who casually shrugged us off, was Michael Ben-Ari, an
###234 ultra-right member of Israel's parliament who lived in the
###237 settlement across the road.
###239 And Ben-Ari had a history of questionable behavior.
###242 Besides openly advocating for the departure of Palestinians
###246 from the West Bank, the US refused to grant him a
###248 visitor's visa because he'd been included on the State
###251 Department's Terrorist Watch List.
###254 Oh, and he's also been known to post heartwarming photos on
###256 his Facebook page, like this one, which shows him and a
###259 buddy relaxing on a couch confiscated from an Arab
###262 family that had just been evicted from their home.
###266 Unfortunately, the soldiers were pressuring us
###269 to leave the site.
###270 So we got back on the road and continued our trek to Havat
###273 Gilad, which is known for attracting
###275 its own set of problems.
###276 Besides it being a hot spot for violence, Israel is known
###279 to come in and routinely bulldoze
###281 these illegal outposts.
###283 But the settlers are always more than happy to rebuild.
###286 So we were curious to see what shape the place was in.
###289 When we arrived, we came upon two teenagers who were
###292 building a house from the ground up.
