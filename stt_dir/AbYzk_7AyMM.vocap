###30 NOAH SALASNEK: I definitely skateboarded before I ever
###32 snowboarded.
###33 I probably started skateboarding when I was six
###35 years old, I believe.
###36 My older brother actually, when I was young, was my
###39 mentor for skateboarding.
###40 But as I got older, and got into it, and progressed, some
###45 of the prominent pros at the time, obviously Tony Hawk, and
###48 some of the vert skaters, as I was a vert
###51 skater at the time mainly.
###52 One of my first sponsors was a shop sponsor,
###55 Marin Surf and Skate.
###56 And that kind of gave me a stepping stone to enter some
###59 contests and get some visibility.
###61 I started getting in magazines, and traveling a
###64 little more, and I got picked up by H-Street later on.
###67 Yeah, I was in a couple different H-Street videos.
###69 The first one I was not in, I think it was "Shackle Me Not"
###72 was the name of it.
###72 But that was the one that got so much notoriety.
###77 And then I got on H-Street and I was in the following "Hokus
###79 Pokus" video the next year, I believe, and had a
###82 good part in that.
###83 Mack Dawg had actually got me on.
###85 I was friends with Mack Dawg and he was
###87 making videos for H-Street.
###88 This was before the videos were a big craze.
###91 The Bones Brigade videos were like the only thing.
###93 So H-Street came out with a great video
###96 inspired by Mack Dawg.
###98 And he actually got me on the team and got me
###100 introduced to them.
###102 MIKE MCENTIRE: Well because of "Sick Boys," Mike
###105 Ternasky saw that.
###106 He was pretty hyped on it.
###107 I think the main thing he liked about it
###109 was the Super 8 filming.
###112 He didn't know much about film and he wanted to have that
###114 look in "Hokus Pokus." So that was the main reason why I got
###118 hired for that gig and it worked out pretty well.
###122 NOAH SALASNEK: It's all history there because I
###123 started shooting with Mack Dawg with snowboarding too and
###126 kind of gave him a career, and in return, he's helped my
###128 career too.
###129 So it's been pretty cool.
###131 The reason I turned pro was I had just competed the year
###134 prior in three different events
###136 to get to the nationals.
###137 And I went there, qualified in the street, and for the vert
###140 contest as well, which was my forte, a vert skater.
###143 And I ended up winning a street contest the day before
###146 the vert contest.
###147 And everyone was like, you're going to turn pro.
###148 And I'm like, what do you mean?
###149 They're like, dude, you won the biggest event, amateur
###152 event, you're going to get a board.
###153 I'm like, really?
###154 And I was like, I don't know about that.
###156 And then I did horrible on the vert contest because I was
###158 just stoked on that I won the street thing.
###160 And sure enough, I did turn pro and for a few years had my
###163 own board with H-Street and Life Skateboards at the time.
###167 And I did pretty well.
###168 I wish I would've hung on to that career a little more now
###170 that I look back and juggled both, kind of
###172 like Shawn White does.
###173 I feel he's kind of a new school of me.
###175 He's really powerful on vert, and doing well in
###178 competitions, and killing in snowboarding, obviously.
###181 So he's someone who has kind of taken a step farther than
###184 what I did, I feel like.
###186 MIKE RANQUET: About the same time I met him snowboarding
###187 through Roach, he was already coming up in
###190 NorCal skate scene.
###193 And man, that guy was so talented.
###196 And when you see someone on a vert ramp that size do a 6
###199 foot ollie, like over your head frontside
###202 ollies, it's like wow.
###206 And yeah, I knew if he got into snowboarding, he would
###210 help change things.
###211 He was a much better skater than me.
###215 He was a pro.
###216 He had a pro model deservedly, not because he was like
###219 "snowboarder." It wasn't like a token type thing.
###224 He was a legit gnarly pro vert skater.
###228 NOAH SALASNEK: I guess it was around a seven to eight year
###229 career that I had in skateboarding before I
###232 actually stepped away and focused more on snowboarding
###236 in my early 20s, I would say.
###238 And not that I let my stating go, but definitely the
###240 competitive side I did.
###242 And I still skateboarded for fun, but I really focused on
###245 the snow and made that my main profession, I could say.
###249 So I think I started snowboarding when I was 18.
###252 And it was kind of a cross between my skiing and my
###254 skateboarding.
###255 I was like, wow, snowboarding looks so cool to me.
###258 And so I got into it way later than actually
###260 skating, for sure.
###262 CHRIS ROACH: Yeah, when I first met him he was already a
###264 professional skateboarder.
###265 I think him and AV were both professional and they were
###270 just getting into snowboarding.
###272 And once I saw them skating, I was like, holy.
###275 They were already ripping skaters.
###279 If we went somewhere together, I could watch them skate and
###282 try to learn from them.
###283 And it was nice not to be the only one around having that.
###288 And they were pushing snowboarding like they were
###291 skateboarding.
###293 NOAH SALASNEK: When I started snowboarding, I saw people
###295 like Chris and a few other pro snowboarders on the hill when
###300 I was actually learning, I guess.
###301 And this was probably in the, I don't know, late '80s.
###304 And I saw people like Chris just ripping down the hill.
###307 And I was like, wow, these guys are really good.
###309 And it just kind of motivated me to ride more and
###312 aspire to be that.
###314 MIKE RANQUET: Noah has a lot more to do with things than
###316 maybe people know or maybe even he knows.
###318 Noah with Mack Dawg for sure helped turn
###321 that tide, like 100%.
###325 BRAD KREMER: I think in "Hokus Pokus" there was a couple
###328 snowboarding shots of Noah.
###329 And Dawger just was totally against the whole snowboard
###333 scene and stuff.
###334 MIKE MCENTIRE: Well, snowboarding was pretty
###337 hurting, I thought.
###338 And it actually was pretty harsh.
###341 Like early snowboarding, guys didn't really understand
###346 anything about style at all.
###347 There was a few people that did, like Terry Kidwell and
###350 Craig Kelly, and they were like doing it right.
###353 But for the most part, your average people that you would
###356 see, they'd just suck.
###357 Man, I can't even describe how lame it looked.
###359 I was over it.
###361 We went up there and there was all these dudes in hard boots
###363 and tights basically, like Day-Glo stuff.
###367 And it just looked so stupid.
###370 And I was filming skating, like Danny Way, and Hensley,
###373 and Noah, and those guys, and all the
###375 CBS guys in San Francisco.
###377 Like the contrast between those snowboarder dudes that I
###380 saw and stating, I just thought it was stupid.
###384 
###386 Anyways, Noah wanted that shot, so we went and got it.
###389 But then I started snowboarding with him and I
###392 enjoyed it a lot.
###393 And then him and Roach were going off doing stuff.
###395 And they made snowboarding look good.
###397 So that's why I started shooting it.
###400 CHRIS ROACH: When we were riding together, like every
###402 day it was something new.
###404 Every single day we were changing what was going to
###407 happen with snowboarding.
###408 And I remember those two years, or whatever was going
###410 on when we were doing that, that snowboarding was going
###413 into a new direction.
###414 And it was nice to be a part of that.
###415 And I think Noah was one of the guys who was in the
###418 forefront of that.
###419 And there would be no stopping it at that point.
###422 SHAWN FARMER: I don't know what it was with those two,
###423 but it was obvious--
###425 I still feel like that whole look still came from Terry
###428 Kidwell, and like Palmer, and then Craig Kelly, and Roach
###433 was always there too, and Salas.
###435 But I don't even see it today really, hardly.
###438 You just don't see it.
###440 It was just like I don't know why those dudes got it and
###443 like a lot of people didn't.
###444 But it was really cool looking.
###446 They like rode together.
###448 That was part of why they are the way they are.
###452 JAMIE LYNN: Noah had more of like a technicality to him and
###457 did more spin-oriented tricks where Chris would kick out a
###463 big grasser and Noah would do like a backside seven.
###468 Both sick, equally impressive tricks, but just you could
###473 tell that one was kind of a technician and the other one
###475 was kind of like laid back and cruising, but also on point.
###481 NOAH SALASNEK: No, if anything he was more proficient.
###482 He was the better rider.
###483 I was trying to aspire to be calmer like he is.
###486 He's really calm on his board.
###488 And I think I had that arm movement that's so famous.
###491 God, I don't know where that came from.
###493 But, yeah, I lost that.
###494 And part of that I can contribute to Roach.
###496 A calm style, he's always had that, and very fluid.
###499 And I think I developed my style more over the years,
###502 whereas he actually just had style, just hands down.
###506 People might have said I have, but I think that I worked on
###508 it a little more, I worked for it.
###509 They either say you have style or you don't.
###512 You can work at it a little bit and get some style if you
###514 ride it enough.
###516 CHRIS ROACH: I don't think our styles were mimicking each
###518 other at all.
###519 I think if you look at it, we don't ride alike at all, but
###524 we did a lot of the same tricks and stuff because we
###529 fucking hung out every day.
###530 And it was like, that was sick, how about I try it?
###535 JP WALKER: He was one of the first guys that I was super
###538 hyped on in snowboarding.
###539 Like the first video I ever saw was "Critical Condition"
###543 and he had like a really sick part in that video.
###547 It wasn't like a part, but he was like in the video.
###549 And he was, I felt, one of the guys that just kind of have
###553 like a sick style.
###554 Like Chris Roach is in the video too, but he didn't have
###557 much footage in it because he got hurt.
###559 And I was just stoked on Salasnek's style.
###562 I mean I had long blonde hair and a goatee.
###564 I looked just like him besides maybe a dip in the mouth.
###567 Like I totally tried to model myself after him for so long.
###571 NOAH SALASNEK: Well, I think with Mack Dawg, growing up I
###574 had a relationship with him.
###575 We got along really well.
###577 So I'd say he was the easiest best person to film with.
###580 And then with snowboarding, I met Faultline Films and they
###583 were pretty cool people, I'd have to say.
###585 They were my first real snowboard film company that I
###588 worked with legitimate.
###589 Got some recognition one year on that.
###592 I had this offer from H-Street to make a snowboard.
###594 And I said, hey, let's do one.
###595 They put my name on a board.
###597 And unfortunately, one of the owners had got in an accident
###599 and passed away.
###600 And the other owner of H-Street did not want anything
###602 to do with snowboarding and I was kind of left in limbo.
###605 And I ended up going to a trade show with a resume and
###608 going to Tom Sims in the booth.
###610 And they had new backers and kind of worked
###612 out a deal with them.
###613 It was kind of a good timing type thing.
###615 But yeah, it was unfortunate because I think H-Street could
###617 have done something in snowboarding had
###620 Mike Ternasky lived.
###621 But anyway, it was sad and it was unfortunate, but I did
###626 work it out with Sims and ride for them for
###628 seven or eight years.
###630 TOM SIMS: I mean Noah was just a really easygoing, likable
###633 guy, and you couldn't help but like the guy.
###640 He was so low-key that when you did seem him in a
###643 half-pipe competition, you're almost like, gosh, it almost
###647 seems like it's a different guy because he was so
###651 technically advanced on his tricks.
###654 The other snowboarders could appreciate what Noah was doing
###657 and quite often the judges didn't.
###659 CHRIS ROACH: I think what set Noah and I apart
###662 was that, for me--
###666 I mean I gave a shit, I did contests and stuff, but I
###669 never did well in them.
###670 And Noah would go in there and his head was always together.
###674 He always did well in contests.
###675 I mean, he could go to any contest and, fuck, he was
###678 going to be top three no matter what.
###680 I'd go there and even if we are the same rider and I
###683 should be up there, I'd get fucking 10th and be like,
###685 yeah, I got 10th.
###686 And he wasn't stoked, man.
###688 He wanted to win everything.
###689 And that's cool, man.
###690 He had a lot of heart and passion for it.
###692 CIRCE WALLACE: I feel like Noah took it farther.
###696 I think Noah was technically more capable.
###700 Chris really, he was a little bit of an underachiever, where
###706 Noah wasn't.
###708 He wanted it all the way.
###710 And yeah, I think he made more money.
###713 NOAH SALASNEK: Just after riding for Sims for the first
###715 year, and getting the response we had, and having a pro
###718 model, and coming into money being young, and just being so
###722 adamant about my career and snowboarding at the time, I
###724 just focused on that.
###725 I bought a house in Tahoe and really when after it.
###728 I made that decision, my professional career to be a
###732 snowboarding.
###733 And financially it worked out at the time and so
###735 I stuck with it.
###736 TOM SIMS: The Noah Salasnek board when we first came out
###739 with it was one of the most progressive
###742 snowboards we ever made.
###744 And it was so cool.
###746 One of the ones had a skateboard
###747 graphic on the bottom.
###749 It just showed that so many of the Sims team riders had solid
###753 skateboarding backgrounds.
###755 And I had a skateboarding background before I got into
###758 snowboarding.
###759 And so, that connection was very much a part
###764 of what Sims was.
###765 NOAH SALASNEK: Well my first graphic with Sims, I had
###767 always wanted to do like a skateboard base.
###770 And that's what we ended up doing.
###771 The top sheet was kind of totally unrelated.
###773 It had kind of like a hobo with a dog.
###775 It kind of looked like me, I suppose, with
###777 the goatee and stuff.
###778 But nonetheless, the base had the independent looking trucks
###783 and wheels and stuff.
###784 So that was my idea then.
###786 And that board did pretty well, actually.
###788 And it's funny because Hetzel came out with one even though
###790 he heard that I had done that.
###791 And he did it, I think, the same year even though he knew
###794 that I had done that, which I don't know
###795 why he would do that.
###796 But whatever, I don't think he sold half as many boards as I
###799 did that year.
###800 So what do I care?
###801 I'm just playing, I'm friends with Hetzel.
###803 But that was pretty funny.
###805 I think Palmer was the one who told him he should do it.
###807 Because Palmer was pissed that I got on Sims and I'm getting
###810 a board right away.
###811 He's ridden for them for years and now he's
###812 getting his first board.
###814 So he's like Hetz, make your skateboard base, that's cool.
###817 Noah, do it too.
###819 So he thought he'd get the last laugh, but my board did
###822 well that year, so that was cool.
###824 KEVIN ENGLISH: It's funny, I forget what Standard movie it
###827 is with Salasnek.
###828 There's like a part where he's riding an old Sims board, I
###831 don't know what it was, like Sims half-pipe or something,
###833 where he's kind of wearing like the
###836 color-blocked pants and stuff.
###838 It was also the year that he came out with his
###841 skateboard pro model.
###843 So half the shots he was the little character that was on
###845 his boards and then the other shots he was kind of like the
###848 late '80s snowboarder guy.
###850 But it was like his season was mixed.
###851 I don't know how that really went down, but you could
###854 definitely see a distinct style change right there.
###857 And then I think snowboarding kind of followed Noah with it.
###861 NOAH SALASNEK: I think working with Standard and having that
###864 "TB 2" part come out was one of my better parts and
###867 definitely gave me a good push and motivated me to film with
###870 them further for "TB 3" and "4." But yeah, I think it was
###874 one of my better parts.
###875 And I think it was, again, good timing.
###877 The time it came out was kind of early back in the day.
###881 Yeah, I'm proud of that part, absolutely.
###884 MIKE HATCHETT: When we picked a crew for "TB 2," it was
###885 basically just a combination of my brother and I and Mack
###890 Dawg sitting down and saying, who's the best 10 or 12 guys
###893 we want to shoot?
###895 Noah was my bro from Tahoe.
###896 We knew he ripped and was potentially one of the best
###898 guys in the world.
###899 And then there was the whole big mountain guys that I was
###901 more friends with.
###902 So it was a combination of Mack Dawg's freestyle
###904 background and him picking those guys and having the
###906 connections, and then me being connected with my brother and
###909 the big mountain scene, and just kind of shuffling the
###912 deck and going here's the hand we want to play right here.
###915 And some of it came to do with Faultline too.
###917 Some of the guys who worked with Faultline for years were
###919 getting a little fed up with it and wanted
###920 to go in a new direction.
###921 So the timing was good for us.
###923 For Noah and Terrier, those guys just wanted to try
###926 something new.
###927 So when they heard that Mack Dawg and I want to go out on
###930 our own, they were all pretty stoked because I think they
###932 had realized the vision.
###934 MIKE MCENTIRE: As a filmmaker back then, I wasn't interested
###936 in filming anyone snowboarding until they had learned a bunch
###940 of new stuff every year.
###941 So what did mean for us?
###943 Well, at the beginning of the year we're riding powder every
###945 day while everyone's learning their stuff.
###947 I didn't even start filming until spring.
###949 So I had met up with the Hatchetts in Squaw and just
###951 riding with them stuff.
###953 And I know Mike was pretty frustrated about his situation
###956 over at Faultline.
###957 And he was hitting me up.
###958 I was making these pretty low-budget films.
###961 He was like, why don't you get a 16 millimeter camera and
###964 let's do this, dude.
###965 And I thought about it and I wanted to
###967 move up into 16 anyways.
###970 Because I was just shooting Super 8 and Hi8 and stuff.
###972 And so I got a camera, like a 1960 Airflex of this super old
###978 guy who used it maybe once.
###979 It was like brand new.
###981 And then I got out there and we started doing our thing.
###984 We made Standard Films.
###986 And I came up with the name when I was taking a leak at
###988 some gas station.
###990 There was a Standard urinal there.
###992 And I'm like, sick, Standard.
###995 So that was how I came up with that name.
###997 And it was a lot of fun, man.
###999 There was a good time in snowboarding back then, a lot
###1002 of progression.
###1002 And it was super easy back then because nothing
###1006 much had been done.
###1007 So it was good stuff.
###1008 NOAH SALASNEK: The only difference is Standard is
###1010 going to meet at 5:00 AM at the gas station and Artie and
###1013 them might meet you at 9:15.
###1015 So you get to sleep in a little more when you're
###1017 working with Faultline maybe.
###1018 But other than that, they're both professional on site and
###1022 they're both motivated, dedicated, good filmers.
###1024 You know you're going to get the shot.
###1025 That's why I like filming with them.
###1027 If I'm going to go risk my life or hike some peak and do
###1030 some line, I want to guarantee that it gets in the can, and
###1032 you can get that working with people like that,
###1034 professionals.
###1035 MIKE HATCHETT: I guess what Mack Dawg and I and my brother
###1038 wanted to prove is we wanted to make the best snowboard
###1040 video that ever had been made.
###1042 And I don't want to say that sounding arrogantly or cocky
###1046 in any way, but we just thought that the movies that
###1049 were out there were good, but they weren't great.
###1052 We wanted to focus on just snowboarding itself and the
###1055 characters, the riders, themselves and not so much of
###1057 the storytelling and narration.
###1060 We were over the Faultline narration, we went here, and
###1062 we did this, and we did that.
###1063 And again, not to dis on Jerry and Artie because Faultline is
###1066 a great film company, and the contribution they made in
###1069 snowboarding was amazing.
###1070 But yeah, we wanted to get away from that and more just
###1073 like this is dope snowboarding, here's some good
###1076 music, here's Noah Salasnek, watch him rip.
###1079 [PUNK MUSIC PLAYING]
###1102 NOAH SALASNEK: I think there was a cool shot of Granite
###1104 Chief Peak where I do like two turns and pop like a 30, 40
###1107 foot cliff maybe max, and land it pretty good, and do a
###1110 couple turns out.
###1111 And I was on like a race board, but no one probably
###1113 knows, like a 170.
###1115 But it was pretty cool because I was able
###1116 to stomp the landing.
###1117 But what they don't know, or maybe it's in the slam
###1120 section, I went back up and tried it again and ended up
###1122 tumbling and just tomahawking at like 30 miles an hour.
###1125 It was one of my worst beat-downs.
###1127 I think it did make the slam section, actually.
###1129 But when I stomped it was pretty rewarding for sure.
###1133 So that stands out in my mind
###1135 JEREMY JONES: Noah's was the first style that really kind
###1138 of drew me in.
###1139 And that's when it was really like, oh, I get it now.
###1143 Because before it was Damian in hard boots like going down
###1147 the fingers at Tahoe or getting dropped off in a
###1150 helicopter.
###1151 And to me as a kid, it was something that was just what
###1156 those guys did.
###1157 It was nothing I could ever imagine doing.
###1161 And then when these other guys went to that level, I could
###1166 grasp that and it made sense.
###1168 And then all a sudden, it was me and my buddies, like we're
###1171 doing what they're doing, and we could do this one day.
###1177 JP WALKER: Maybe the year before, like somebody did like
###1180 a late backside 180.
###1181 And then Noah's part came out the year later and had like
###1184 late switch backside 3's and all this crazy stuff.
###1187 So I was all about that and doing butters.
###1190 Like butters was just like the only thing for a while that
###1194 mattered, just butter from the top of the lift to the bottom.
###1198 And he was super good at it.
###1199 And it was sick because I remember he had like shots
###1204 where he'd butter up to cornices and spin off of them
###1207 and all kinds of stuff like that.
###1209 So I was just like goateed up and buttering it up.
###1214 NOAH SALASNEK: I don't know who started the whole little
###1216 butter thing.
###1216 I know we got kind of into the nose pressing and tail
###1219 pressing and trying blunt slides or
###1221 whatever they're called.
###1222 I mean everyone's got a different name for them.
###1224 But yeah, there was a little era everyone went through.
###1226 They were trying to press the nose and spin out of this and
###1230 that and went through a little phase.
###1231 But it's pretty cool.
###1232 I've been known to sit back on my tail and snap a 180 out of
###1235 it now and again.
###1236 So it's still pretty fun to dabble in, little nose press
###1239 or butters or whatever.
###1240 MIKE HATCHETT: And kind of what's cool about filming back
###1243 "TB 2," "3," "4," there wasn't like today it's almost, OK,
###1248 we're going to go to this knoll and build this gap
###1251 that's been filmed 20 gazillion times.
###1253 We're going to hit this log, or I'm going to back lip this
###1255 rail, or I'm going to do a front side through this kink,
###1257 or I'm going to do a switch back 1260, whatever.
###1261 You're going to do this trick and it's a set-up shot.
###1264 You're sitting sideways, you point it, you do your trick,
###1268 you land just far enough for the shot, and you're done.
###1272 We'd just go out and look up at something and go, let's
###1274 just ride it, let's just film that.
###1276 Watch Noah's part from "TB 4," his opening shot, you can just
###1280 see the spontaneous riding in that shot.
###1283 It's just slashing front 3's.
###1287 He just cruised it.
###1288 JP WALKER: The one thing that stood out to me was he had
###1291 this backside 720 tail grab.
###1293 I think it was like somewhere in Tahoe, like a spot, maybe
###1297 it was like at Mount Rose or something, it was like a
###1298 cornice gap thing.
###1299 And it was just like the best backside 720 to ever go down,
###1306 I felt like, in the history of snowboarding.
###1308 I remember it was just like so good, and tail grab, and I was
###1314 pretty hyped on that.
###1315 SHAWN FARMER: I mean Salasnek for a while was just crushing
###1318 every one, I think, out there, on overall just riding.
###1322 And he was throwing tail grab 7's and 9's.
###1324 I know 7's.
###1326 I think 9's too.
###1328 And just crazy stuff and like super smooth style.
###1332 I've always looked up to him always thought he was just one
###1335 of the best for sure, timeless.
