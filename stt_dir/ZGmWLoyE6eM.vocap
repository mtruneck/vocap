###7 This is kind of interesting here.
###8 Take a look at this.
###9 Total cereal, right.
###12 Take a look at the side there.
###14 It's like a science lab.
###16 Look at iron.
###17 100% of your recommended daily allowance.
###21 Is that true?
###22 Is there really iron in breakfast cereal?
###25 Only one way to find out.
###27 You're going to be buying a box soon, trust me.
###30 I'm Steve Spangler, and I'm all about making science fun.
###33 For the last 20 years, I've been teaching ways to turn
###36 ordinary science experiments into unforgettable learning
###39 experiences.
###40 I have an amazing team who will do whatever it takes to
###43 affect the way people think about science.
###45 And to do that, I live by one motto.
###48 Make it big, do it right, give it class.
###51 
###56 So the only way to figure out whether or not this iron is
###59 actually metallic iron is to do a
###62 little test with a magnet.
###63 Now an ordinary magnet doesn't seem to work that well, so if
###66 you want the best results possible, you're going to need
###68 one of these.
###69 It's a really, really strong magnet.
###72 You can see how it jumps to and attaches to
###75 anything like this.
###77 And in fact, if you have one magnet in your hand like this,
###81 you can actually attract the second magnet and
###85 you see what happens.
###86 This can be very, very dangerous because if you try
###88 to pull one magnet off and it jumps up into the other one,
###91 it can actually pinch your fingers.
###93 That's why I recommend storing the magnets using this
###96 particular method here.
###97 Just take a tennis ball and cut it open here.
###100 So cut open the tennis ball like this, and drop the
###103 neodymium into the tennis ball.
###106 You can seal it back up with a little glue if you want to,
###108 but this is just the way that I store them, because they're
###110 easy to be able to hook together--
###112 and, here, that's kind of fun.
###114 So watch this.
###115 You can mess with people like this.
###116 You try to do the balancing trick.
###118 Remember I've got one here and one here.
###121 So here, watch this.
###123 Isn't that awe--
###124 ah, see, you can kind of see how that works.
###126 But what a great way to be able to hold on to the
###129 neodymium magnets without pinching them accidentally
###132 between your layer of skin.
###135 And just a great way to be able to mess with people at
###137 the same time.
###138 All right, so let's start with this.
###140 Simply open up the box of Total cereal.
###142 If you're doing this for somebody, they're going to
###145 think that you tampered with it, so you really should show
###147 them that you're opening up the cereal.
###149 So here is, unopened, from the factory.
###153 There is our cereal.
###156 Take out a couple flakes here like this.
###158 If it's magnetic, then we should be able to just pick up
###162 the cereal using the magnet.
###165 So, to isolate it--
###166 here, let me hang onto it like this.
###169 Let's just crush it up.
###171 All right, and so you should be able to just pick up the
###173 cereal, and of course, you can see that we're no luck picking
###177 up the cereal, unless you look very, very closely.
###181 Watch and look at the edges of the cereal, you start to see,
###185 right around the edge here--
###187 what could either be static electricity--
###189 or maybe there really is iron in that breakfast cereal.
###195 Smashing them is not going to convince anybody.
###196 I don't think that's a true test if there's iron in
###198 breakfast cereal.
###199 So try this.
###201 Try reaching in and getting some huge flakes,
###204 and let's do this.
###205 Let's see whether or not we can attract them using a dish
###212 of water, all right.
###213 So here's our plate with water.
###216 
###218 The object here is that we want an environment with as
###222 little friction as possible.
###223 So we're going to take the flakes and just float them on
###225 the surface of the water like this.
###229 Now watch what happens when we get our magnet close to it.
###232 Let me stay away, and watch what
###234 happens when we get close.
###236 Now, the skeptic will say that you're blowing on the flake,
###241 but you're not.
###243 Look at this, let's see if I can get this one and actually
###244 pull it over.
###245 Nice.
###246 So they're kind of ice skating flakes, right, but it really
###250 is just water--
###251 I'll pull this one over here as well--
###253 which must mean that there is a little bit of iron, or at
###257 least the hypothesis would be there's just a little bit of
###259 iron in each and every one of those flakes.
###262 It's not conclusive proof, but it is very cool.
###265 And the only way to really see whether or not there's iron in
###268 Total cereal is either to take it to a lab, or, maybe better,
###271 we could just get somebody to eat a bowl of cereal, then we
###274 just remove the contents of their stomach--
###278 I think I got a better way.
###279 We'll use a model.
###282 A Ziploc bag will be perfect for this.
###285 So you're going to want a heavy duty Ziploc bag, and the
###288 suggestion here is this.
###289 Open up the Ziploc bag, and you're going to put about a
###292 cup of Total cereal in the Ziploc bag.
###294 
###297 Now they say on the side of the package that a cup of
###299 cereal is equal to one serving.
###301 And so I'm just going to estimate that that's about a
###305 serving, one cup.
###307 The next part is we've got to liquefy the cereal, so take
###311 water and fill the bag with water.
###313 Probably half to three quarters full with water seems
###318 to be just about right.
###319 If it doesn't work for you, chances
###321 are it was too soup-like.
###323 You need to have it far more runny, like water.
###327 Seal it up.
###329 Make sure there's a little bit of air inside like this.
###331 And now, we just need to shake it around.
###334 We're going to let it sit, believe it or not, for a half
###336 hour to 45 minutes, because we really want it to dissolve.
###340 Now you could crush the cereal ahead of time, but I think the
###342 cleanest way to do it, and the most conclusive way so people
###346 don't think that you've tampered with it, is to just
###348 set it out here and let it dissolve and come back to it
###351 in a half an hour or 45 minutes.
###354 Otherwise, I'll just keep on doing this.
###356 
###358 There's a half an hour of my life I'll never get back.
###361 Look, I got it to you the way that it needs to be.
###363 Look at this.
###364 You want it soup-like.
###366 Fair enough?
###367 All right.
###368 So now you need the magnet.
###369 So here's the technique.
###371 Take the magnet, put it on your hand, put the bag on top
###374 of the magnet like this.
###376 And now, shake it around.
###378 You're trying to make contact with as much of the cereal as
###381 you can with that magnet.
###383 Notice how there's a little bit of air in the bag as well,
###385 so that when we turn it over, we can actually see what
###388 happens without it falling back down.
###390 Turn the whole thing upside down.
###392 And now what I'm going to do is get in there with this so
###394 I'm not messing around with it with my hand.
###397 Look at this.
###399 There's the iron in the Total cereal.
###401 It's actually called "roughly sheared ingot iron." This is
###405 food-grade metallic iron that they put it in cereals, they
###409 put it in breads, they put it in other foods.
###412 The FDA completely allows this, and this is how they
###415 iron fortify a food.
###417 However, somebody who's much smarter than I am said that
###419 you'd have to eat the equivalent of--
###422 I don't know--
###422 4,000 or 5,000 boxes of Total cereal during a given day to
###427 make enough iron to actually produce a nail.
###429 So, I think you probably already knew that.
###432 But, the idea is probably there, and very, very cool.
###435 If you look at what you're putting inside your body,
###438 there's a huge debate over this iron.
###441 Is it good for you, number one, and is it
###444 beneficial for you?
###445 Just because they put it inside, is it truly
###447 beneficial.
###448 But most importantly, it's just a lot of fun to sit here
###450 and to play with it.
###451 Most people don't know that you can take the iron out of
###454 Total cereal, so it makes for a very, very cool project.
###458 Now, if this is the only cereal that you test, it's not
###461 a very good science fair project.
###463 If you're looking for something like this for a
###465 science fair project, compare all of these
###467 cereals over here.
###468 As you take a look at the iron level on all of these cereals,
###471 you can see that on some of them, it's as low as 45% over
###475 here, and as high as 90% here for like Shredded Wheat.
###479 The real debate, and the feedback I'd like to hear from
###481 you is whether you think that's beneficial for your
###484 body, but maybe more importantly, can your body
###486 actually process this reduced iron.
###489 It its raw, metallic form, does your body process it and
###493 put it into a form that's usable by your body for the
###498 iron that you need.
###499 It's the number one elemental deficiency in the world.
###502 Women need four times the amount of iron that men do.
###506 But it's just very, very cool from a food science standpoint
###509 to see that this is how they iron fortify our food.
###512 So when you were a kid and the teacher said, play that game,
###515 magnetic or not.
###517 Like in second grade, you'd have to go around and touch
###519 things that were magnetic or not, and then everybody always
###521 ruined the TV, because some dumb kid put
###523 it on the TV, and--
###525 hope that wasn't you.
###526 So money was the thing that they always put down and say,
###529 is money magnetic or not.
###531 Well of course, in the United States, it's not, in Canada
###534 firm, some of the money is magnetic.
###536 But that's not necessarily true.
###538 That dollar bill that you see right there.
###540 Magnetic or not?
###542 Answer is, magnetic.
###544 And I'll show you how.
###545 Well we're back to our friend, the neodymium magnet, and let
###548 me put it on the knife there, so that we can get it close.
###551 Here, watch this.
###551 I'm going to lift up the dollar bill like this.
###554 And watch what happens as we get close.
###556 As you get close to the dollar bill--
###559 no, it's not static electricity--
###561 it's actually the iron that's in the dollar bill.
###564 The iron is in the ink of the dollar bill.
###568 And it's one of the ways they tell whether or not the dollar
###569 bill is counterfeit.
###570 So, I'm told-- although I don't know if this is true--
###573 that some of the vending machines actually have an
###576 electromagnetic circuit in there, so that if you put just
###578 a regular piece of paper or a fake bill in and it doesn't
###581 sense the iron, then that's when the alarm goes off.
###584 It could be just a myth, but it kind of makes sense that
###588 there's iron there in that ink.
###590 But is it the kind of iron that you can actually
###592 pull out and see?
###593 Are there little pieces of iron?
###594 Back to the trusty blender we go.
###597 Oh, there you go, perfect.
###599 Once again, we are not going to go to jail, because we're
###603 not going to try to pass this money.
###605 We're going to grind it up, we are going to destroy it.
###607 But we're not going to take it and put it back into
###609 circulation.
###609 It's ours, and according to the law, we can do this.
###613 Is that right?
###614 They said yes.
###615 Here we go.
###615 [BLENDING SOUND]
###618 Now the problem with this is you're to really going to
###620 grind it up, so if I were you, I would just
###624 kind of let it go.
###626 
###631 Not really much you can do right now.
###633 You're just going to have to grind it up.
###634 
###637 What we're trying to do is to rip the fibers of this apart.
###641 You will never be able to use this blender for food again.
###643 It's just too gross, right.
###645 But this is exactly what you want to see inside.
###648 See how it's ground up and it's almost held in
###650 suspension.
###651 And now it goes into the Ziploc bag.
###654 This is just disgusting if you think about
###656 how dirty money is.
###657 All right, the money goes into here like this.
###659 Try to get all of it.
###661 Hopefully there's not much left over.
###663 Good.
###664 And now seal it up.
###665 Treat it just like you did the Total cereal for "Eating Nails
###668 for Breakfast."
###669 Now we're going to take our neodymium magnet and put it on
###672 top here, turn it upside down, rock it around.
###675 Take a look at this here.
###676 Oh, this looks great.
###677 Take a look at this, watch.
###678 Here is the iron in your dollar bill.
###682 It's more impressive than the Total cereal.
###684 Look at this.
###685 The iron in the ink is fairly easy to be able to pull out.
###690 The question always comes up, does it only work with a
###692 dollar bill.
###693 And I have no idea.
###695 So, as a response video, go ahead and try it with $5 or
###699 $10, o $20, or maybe some of you wealthy ones out there,
###703 try it with a hundred dollar bill, post the response there.
###705 Of course we will not make fun of you.
###707 All in scientific inquiry.
###711 Just stick with a dollar.
###712 And when you're all done, get yourself a gallon of Clorox
###715 and more hand sanitizer then you could ever imagine,
###718 because you've got to clean up.
###719 This is disgusting.
