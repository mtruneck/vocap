###20 JERRY DUGAN: My name is Jerry Dugan from FLF Films, formerly
###23 Fall Line Films.
###24 We're in Reno, Nevada, in our new space that we just got
###29 settled into.
###31 We're up in our edit bay.
###33 "On the Western Front, Project Six, Snowboarders in Exile."
###38 And I have a whole storage area that's
###41 got even more tapes.
###45 I got to say we've been doing this for a little while.
###48 TOM BURT: Pretty much the first snowboard video that was
###51 put out by anybody was from Jerry and Arty
###54 and Fall Line films.
###55 TODD RICHARDS: The very first movie that I ever got was
###57 called "The Western Front," and it was completely
###62 different than anything else I'd ever seen.
###64 At that time, Fall Line made the movie that everyone wanted
###69 to be in, everyone wanted to see it, you had to see it, and
###72 it was just insane.
###74 JERRY DUGAN: So here you go.
###75 This is it.
###77 
###80 Granted, this is like 1988 or something, '87, it
###82 was a long time ago.
###85 We had this section of paradise here, and that was
###89 the idea, all is quiet on the western front.
###91 There's all these screwed up things happening in the world,
###95 the riots over the Ayatollah dying, China killing it's own
###98 people for wanting freedom and basic democratic principles.
###102 We were on the edge of nuclear war, but we had this little
###105 pocket of pleasure that nothing really mattered
###107 because we were snowboarding and we were
###108 super happy about that.
###109 -How about if all the soldiers in the world traded in their
###112 weapons for snowboards?
###114 -I'm all for it.
###115 -Right on.
###117 DAVE SEOANE: Well the western front was more like a frozen
###119 discotheque.
###121 
###138 STEVE GRAHAM: It was just like a day and a half of filming in
###140 the late season in Squaw Valley.
###143 There's a couple fun things.
###146 TOM BURT: "Western Front" was the first video where it was
###148 like I'd sit there and study.
###151 Just watch it and watch it and watch it.
###154 We were snowboarding the way we thought it was supposed to
###157 be, and we were having a good time at it, but then we saw
###160 this and it completely changed--
###163 it spoke to me because it was way more like skating and
###165 everything was really in slow motion.
###168 When, back east, we were really herky-jerky with our
###172 tweaks and grabs, and those guys were super slow, hold it.
###176 We were slapping our boards, and those guys were holding
###179 everything and really making it look like one fluid motion.
###184 DAMIAN SANDERS: We would just go out there and jump jumps
###186 and film with Jerry and Arty from Fall Line.
###188 And those were way better than any competition because that
###190 got your name out there everywhere.
###191 It worked out great.
###193 JERRY DUGAN: I thought what they were doing was cool.
###195 I'd grown up skating, and snowboarding was a sport that
###199 I thought was really cool, and just trying to get cool shots.
###202 No idea what we were going to do with it and sold 3,000 or
###207 4,000 copies in like 1988.
###209 It was phenomenal, really.
###211 And we used that, then, to go get sponsorship for the next
###214 year's film, which was "Snowboarders in Exile."
###217 PAT BRIDGES: Everybody says, ooh, "Western
###219 Front" changed my life.
###220 What, when you saw half of it at your buddy's place?
###225 I don't know anybody--
###226 I mean it was like a mythic video.
###228 Ooh, did you see "Western Front"?
###230 No, but I saw "Heavy Metal Parking Lot".
###233 It's like, I don't know.
###235 I think the video that really had an influence and changed
###237 everybody was "Snowboarders in Exile".
###239 That was a video that was huge, and it was
###241 a much better video.
###244 JERRY DUGAN: We'd only made "All's Quiet on the Western
###246 Front" at this point, so this was like a real film for us.
###248 [PUNK MUSIC PLAYING]
###262 VIDEO NARRATOR: Up until now, snowboarders have never had
###264 real movies to call their own.
###267 Small segments in ski movies just weren't enough.
###270 It was time for a real snowboard movie to be made.
###273 If for nothing else, for those people who've watched the
###275 sport grow from it's infancy.
###278 Those people who still remember being exiled from
###280 most major ski areas.
###281 
###285 JERRY DUGAN: When we did "Snowboarders in Exile," we
###287 tried to follow three guys and make it more about a story of
###290 three guys.
###291 And it was Seoane, Graham and Damian.
###293 Other people played into the movie in different sections
###296 and parts and how life happens--
###299 we went here, we met this person and
###300 rode with this person--
###302 but we tried to make it about them and their life and their
###304 experience.
###304 VIDEO NARRATOR: A lot has changed
###305 since those early days.
###307 Snowboarders are allowed most everywhere now, because every
###310 day, people like Damian Sanders, Steve Graham, Dave
###319 Seoane, and Chris Roach push snowboarding to the limits.
###327 The problem with taking something to the limits, is
###329 that most people aren't ready for them.
###332 New ideas are very rarely welcomed with open arms.
###335 TODD RICHARDS: There was a story, and then we went to Val
###338 d'Isere, and that sucked, and then we went to Tahoe--
###341 and it was cheesy as hell.
###343 You watch it now, you're like, oh my god, dude.
###345 But at the same time, that was it.
###349 You just wanted to see that.
###349 You didn't care how stupid Jerry sounds
###352 narrating his own movie.
###353 It was just amazing because there was this one tight group
###357 of people and it was like, and then Damian Sanders and we
###360 went there, and Damian showed us big air.
###364 It is cheesy, but it's just awesome.
###366 People ate it up.
###367 I ate it up.
###368 I was like, holy shit, Damian Sanders.
###369 Awesome.
###370 DAMIAN SANDERS: Jumping is it.
###371 Jumping is what it's all about.
###373 If you can't jump, this isn't your sport.
###378 I thank God I met those guys because I might not have ever
###380 been in that video.
###381 That was a huge career boost.
###382 It was a popularity boost.
###384 It made my whole future in snowboarding.
###385 DAVE SEOANE: "Snowboarder in Exile" is a snowboarder who
###388 gets kicked out of the local resort and having to travel
###393 into the back country or half way around the world to push
###396 their ability more.
###398 There was a group of us from Tahoe, and Noah Salasnek, and
###402 I think there was just--
###403 we were all at the right place at the right time, and it just
###406 worked out that we all kind of just knew each other.
###409 So it wasn't like we had to audition or anything.
###411 We kind of had our own little niche because of the fact that
###413 we didn't really have anything involved with the contest, and
###415 then we did the films.
###417 And so, with all those films, that probably gave us a lot of
###420 recognition that we couldn't get in contests, and it worked
###425 out really well.
###427 STEVE GRAHAM: "Snowboarders in Exile" is driving a car that
###432 isn't legal, push starting it everywhere.
###434 
###437 Living on the edge.
###439 "Snowboarders in Exile."
###441 None of us really knew where we could go, but that year,
###445 they got us to places.
###447 We stayed three weeks in Jackson Hole.
###450 At that time, I remember, because it was unheard of, it
###453 was almost a benefit to us.
###456 It was good.
###457 BRAD KREMER: I would get so much emotion
###458 out of those movies.
###460 I wanted to go to Whistler and hit the wind whip.
###464 I wanted to go to Squaw, and I wanted to go up to Donner.
###467 It's like, he would tell a story and just draw me into
###471 it, and that was the amazing thing.
###474 Most movies these days are all about people sections and
###480 trick, trick, trick and all this stuff.
###482 But back then it was about telling a story about what
###485 snowboarding is and about what the lifestyle is.
###489 And that's what really influenced me.
###492 Old Fall Line movies, the first three or four that they
###495 made, that was filmmaking.
###499 That was really good stuff.
###501 PAT BRIDGES: If you wanted to just see guys who are taking
###504 chances and riding bigger mountains, doing bigger
###510 cliffs, hitting bigger jumps, spinning more, you wanted to
###515 check out Fall Line Films and "Snowboarders in Exile."
###518 TOM BURT: Sometimes you're like, hey, come shoot this
###519 because we found this cliff, we want to jump off of it.
###524 Or it's good power.
###526 And then sometimes they're like, hey, what do you think
###528 about this?
###529 Something that looks good to the camera.
###531 [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING]
###552 JERRY DUGAN: It's by far the best film ever
###555 done at that point.
###557 It's by far at least 22 minutes too long.
###561 But the sport was progressing so fast that you'd put
###565 something in one week, and the next week you're like, oh,
###567 yeah, that kind of sucks.
###570 This was the first of Graham.
###572 This is the big back flip trick, and he goes a double.
###578 That's the thing, back in 1989,
###580 1990, that was a landing.
###583 A year later it was like, oh, you butt checked.
###587 In my ID, he landed.
###589 Little butt check, whatever.
###592 DAVE SEOANE: People were so happy with the film, and it
###594 definitely pushed us to do something a little more
###598 spectacular.
###599 That just means going off something bigger and
###603 a little more risk.
###605 They had a premiere at ASR in San Diego for "Snowboarders in
###611 Exile." And we had no idea what was going to happen, and
###615 it was really nice that there was a lot of people that
###618 showed up, and then it was something to be really proud
###621 of being part of.
###623 So after the film, people were like, no way!
###626 That was a good feeling.
###627 JERRY DUGAN: It was the first time there were like 500 of
###631 the industry's top pros and industry people all in one
###634 spot, and no one had ever really done a premiere like
###637 this before.
###637 And we had this, at the ASR trade show in the fall, it was
###643 for sure highlight of everything, playing this film
###647 for all those people.
###648 DAMIAN SANDERS: And that was like the complete career
###651 changing moment.
###652 Everybody saw that video and saw what was really going on
###654 in snowboarding outside of their little home resort.
###656 And couldn't believe that people were jumping flips off
###658 of cliffs and 360s off of 60 foot cliffs and things.
###661 It made us all instant superstars.
###662 It was killer.
###663 JERRY DUGAN: Did the video make them, or did
###664 they make the video?
###666 Were those guys talented?
###667 Absolutely.
###668 Would they have gone on to what they had gone on to had
###671 it not been for the video?
###672 Possibly, possibly not.
###674 Did it help?
###675 For sure.
###675 Did it make them?
###676 No, they made themselves.
###678 But it for sure was in conjunction to where
###681 they all went to.
###684 Yeah, maybe we did create the video pro.
###686
