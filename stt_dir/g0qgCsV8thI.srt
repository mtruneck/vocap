1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:16,99



2
0:0:16,99 --> 0:0:19,344
MALE SPEAKER: What's all this
fucking shit on the wall?


3
0:0:19,344 --> 0:0:25,805



4
0:0:25,805 --> 0:0:28,29
JASON DILL: I woke up-- for like
a month straight-- just


5
0:0:28,29 --> 0:0:29,29
with blood in my mouth.


6
0:0:29,29 --> 0:0:30,51
MALE SPEAKER: How'd it
get on the wall?


7
0:0:30,51 --> 0:0:30,976
Spitting?


8
0:0:30,976 --> 0:0:31,91
JASON DILL: Yeah.


9
0:0:31,91 --> 0:0:36,65
14 dental appointments and
they're still fucked up.


10
0:0:36,65 --> 0:0:37,77
I know it's gross.


11
0:0:37,77 --> 0:0:39,21
People probably think
it's fucked up.


12
0:0:39,21 --> 0:0:42,92
I mean every day you come in
here you've got like--


13
0:0:42,92 --> 0:0:44,84
literally, I'm not going
to look at it.


14
0:0:44,84 --> 0:0:45,96
I'm just going to be like,
[SPITTING], spit it out.


15
0:0:45,96 --> 0:0:48,5
I just had to see it,
just to make sure.


16
0:0:48,5 --> 0:0:50,83
So I had to look at it every
day, knowing how


17
0:0:50,83 --> 0:0:51,83
crazy it was getting.


18
0:0:51,83 --> 0:0:56,93
It was just a reminder of
just how bad it was.


19
0:0:56,93 --> 0:0:58,4
PATRICK O'DELL: Hi, welcome
back to the show.


20
0:0:58,4 --> 0:1:0,31
This episode's about
Jason Dill.


21
0:1:0,31 --> 0:1:3,22
And I know we already did
a Jason Dill episode.


22
0:1:3,22 --> 0:1:5,1
But while I was making that, I
was looking at all of his old


23
0:1:5,1 --> 0:1:5,91
parts and stuff.


24
0:1:5,91 --> 0:1:8,55
And I thought it'd be cool to
do sort of the history of


25
0:1:8,55 --> 0:1:9,62
Jason Dill.


26
0:1:9,62 --> 0:1:12,5
JASON DILL: My very, very,
very first ad was I was


27
0:1:12,5 --> 0:1:14,46
sitting in a shopping
cart with Caroll


28
0:1:14,46 --> 0:1:15,91
sitting in the front.


29
0:1:15,91 --> 0:1:17,82
Caroll, Ben Chibber, and
Anthony Oglesby.


30
0:1:17,82 --> 0:1:20,0
Me and Anthony Oglesby
are the little guys.


31
0:1:20,0 --> 0:1:22,73
Caroll is only like a
year and a half, two


32
0:1:22,73 --> 0:1:23,81
years older than me.


33
0:1:23,81 --> 0:1:26,3
But I remember them being like,
hey go get Caroll to go


34
0:1:26,3 --> 0:1:27,3
shoot this ad.


35
0:1:27,3 --> 0:1:29,3
Fucking--


36
0:1:29,3 --> 0:1:29,49
what?


37
0:1:29,49 --> 0:1:32,96
Like, I'm not going to
talk to this dude.


38
0:1:32,96 --> 0:1:34,23
Like, it's Mike fucking
Caroll.


39
0:1:34,23 --> 0:1:37,13
My first video part was
an A1 Meats where--


40
0:1:37,13 --> 0:1:38,668
MALE SPEAKER: Is that the one
where you're running through


41
0:1:38,668 --> 0:1:40,54
the-- doing like cartwheels
through the grass?


42
0:1:40,54 --> 0:1:41,5
JASON DILL: Yeah, and doing
flips and shit.


43
0:1:41,5 --> 0:1:42,18
I was 12.


44
0:1:42,18 --> 0:1:43,62
I filmed for three days.


45
0:1:43,62 --> 0:1:45,91
I was just, I can
bigspin that.


46
0:1:45,91 --> 0:1:47,29
I can 360 flip that.


47
0:1:47,29 --> 0:1:48,77
Like, just, all right, do it.


48
0:1:48,77 --> 0:1:51,42
I don't remember like
ever taking time.


49
0:1:51,42 --> 0:1:51,85
I would check out--


50
0:1:51,85 --> 0:1:55,41
I remember seeing Ocean and
Marcus like really try shit.


51
0:1:55,41 --> 0:1:59,3
I remember I got driven to 7th
Street, skate the head.


52
0:1:59,3 --> 0:2:1,155
And I remember this one
kid had a box in


53
0:2:1,155 --> 0:2:1,87
front of his house.


54
0:2:1,87 --> 0:2:3,4
So I did like a nose bump 360.


55
0:2:3,4 --> 0:2:5,5
And I'll hit some gap there.


56
0:2:5,5 --> 0:2:6,58
Instead of like, yeah, I'm just
going to go fucking--


57
0:2:6,58 --> 0:2:7,85
I was a little kid.


58
0:2:7,85 --> 0:2:9,729
Like, I'm going to go
ollie this big gap.


59
0:2:9,729 --> 0:2:11,64
All right.


60
0:2:11,64 --> 0:2:14,81
You know, like Rick Howard, he
taught me how to do a bigspin


61
0:2:14,81 --> 0:2:17,92
to frontside boardslide a day
before I got on Blockhead.


62
0:2:17,92 --> 0:2:20,45
And I tried it in my contest
run for some


63
0:2:20,45 --> 0:2:23,25
reason like a day after.


64
0:2:23,25 --> 0:2:25,32
Who the fuck knows how
I made it to here.


65
0:2:25,32 --> 0:2:26,1
Jesus Christ.


66
0:2:26,1 --> 0:2:28,2
Because if you really think
about it from that perspective


67
0:2:28,2 --> 0:2:30,465
and then so if you could only
imagine, like fast forward to


68
0:2:30,465 --> 0:2:31,68
me skating with Ocean.


69
0:2:31,68 --> 0:2:36,77
Like, those dudes are so far
in advance compared to my


70
0:2:36,77 --> 0:2:38,13
prepubescent mind.


71
0:2:38,13 --> 0:2:39,78
I mean, I'm sure Hensley and
them were doing it before.


72
0:2:39,78 --> 0:2:41,435
But I didn't have the
opportunity to go skate with


73
0:2:41,435 --> 0:2:43,772
Hensley in my prepubescent
years.


74
0:2:43,772 --> 0:2:47,5
MALE SPEAKER: So did you
skate with Jeremy Wray?


75
0:2:47,5 --> 0:2:48,6
JASON DILL: Yeah.


76
0:2:48,6 --> 0:2:48,56
That's weird.


77
0:2:48,56 --> 0:2:50,66
I was talking to someone
about this recently.


78
0:2:50,66 --> 0:2:53,15
I don't even remember
how I met Jeremy.


79
0:2:53,15 --> 0:2:55,34
I remember people doing pressure
flips, but Jeremy was


80
0:2:55,34 --> 0:2:58,1
doing over knee-high
kickflips.


81
0:2:58,1 --> 0:3:3,725
So he was a really big influence
on my whole deal.


82
0:3:3,725 --> 0:3:7,677
MALE SPEAKER: What was the clip
where he does a gap and


83
0:3:7,677 --> 0:3:8,85
you're in the clip?


84
0:3:8,85 --> 0:3:10,1
JASON DILL: The Color Video.


85
0:3:10,1 --> 0:3:11,97



86
0:3:11,97 --> 0:3:14,6
I know I'm in that video because
I tried to ollie that


87
0:3:14,6 --> 0:3:15,686
gap with Jeremy.


88
0:3:15,686 --> 0:3:17,65
No, I didn't come anywhere
near Jeremy.


89
0:3:17,65 --> 0:3:19,99
I don't think I got over it.


90
0:3:19,99 --> 0:3:22,865
I don't even think I got my
board over it with my body.


91
0:3:22,865 --> 0:3:23,96
MALE SPEAKER: Where is that?


92
0:3:23,96 --> 0:3:24,864
Where's the mark?


93
0:3:24,864 --> 0:3:26,672
JASON DILL: Give me five.


94
0:3:26,672 --> 0:3:27,2
Over here.


95
0:3:27,2 --> 0:3:29,192
MALE SPEAKER: How'd
he do that?


96
0:3:29,192 --> 0:3:30,174
Nobody can--


97
0:3:30,174 --> 0:3:31,65
I don't believe it.


98
0:3:31,65 --> 0:3:34,58
It can't be possible.


99
0:3:34,58 --> 0:3:35,71
I don't believe what
I just saw.


100
0:3:35,71 --> 0:3:36,61
I don't believe what
I just saw.


101
0:3:36,61 --> 0:3:38,73
MALE SPEAKER: I even saw
it with my two eyes.


102
0:3:38,73 --> 0:3:42,8
MALE SPEAKER: But I don't
believe what I just saw.


103
0:3:42,8 --> 0:3:44,732
Look at these marks.


104
0:3:44,732 --> 0:3:46,56
Look at these marks.


105
0:3:46,56 --> 0:3:47,57
JASON DILL: I never
thought about it


106
0:3:47,57 --> 0:3:48,97
until later, you know?


107
0:3:48,97 --> 0:3:51,47
Thinking about it right now, I
never thought of myself being


108
0:3:51,47 --> 0:3:52,45
in Jeremy Wray's shadow.


109
0:3:52,45 --> 0:3:56,15
I was in Jeremy Wray's shadow,
but not in a bad way.


110
0:3:56,15 --> 0:3:57,96
Those dudes were so
fucking gnarly.


111
0:3:57,96 --> 0:4:5,16
It really helped me shape and
have what feeds me today.


112
0:4:5,16 --> 0:4:7,84
Man, I've had a fucking
weird, wild ride.


113
0:4:7,84 --> 0:4:10,26
When I was like a
fucking child,


114
0:4:10,26 --> 0:4:13,91
how the fuck my mother--


115
0:4:13,91 --> 0:4:18,7
how she let me do this,
I do not know.


116
0:4:18,7 --> 0:4:20,31
My mom got this job.


117
0:4:20,31 --> 0:4:23,95
And she went up to a business
trip in San Francisco, took me


118
0:4:23,95 --> 0:4:26,82
with her, skated the
streets by myself.


119
0:4:26,82 --> 0:4:30,96
I'm talking about sweat pants,
Converse, and a Batman t-shirt


120
0:4:30,96 --> 0:4:32,3
with a mullet.


121
0:4:32,3 --> 0:4:34,59
I was a goofy white kid from
Huntington Beach, man.


122
0:4:34,59 --> 0:4:34,87
I was just fucking--


123
0:4:34,87 --> 0:4:38,495
I was just enjoying
being there.


124
0:4:38,495 --> 0:4:41,86
I wasn't even worried about
being accepted.


125
0:4:41,86 --> 0:4:45,8
So that was my little early
EMB niche that I somehow


126
0:4:45,8 --> 0:4:47,62
sorted out on my own.


127
0:4:47,62 --> 0:4:50,74
And then by the time I was
15, I already rode for


128
0:4:50,74 --> 0:4:51,5
Spitfire and shit.


129
0:4:51,5 --> 0:4:53,77
So it's like, I think
I just got accepted.


130
0:4:53,77 --> 0:4:56,66
And at that time, which was kind
of rad, they just lumped


131
0:4:56,66 --> 0:4:57,65
me, Jeremy, and Jonas
together.


132
0:4:57,65 --> 0:4:58,405
And hey were like,
fuck, all right.


133
0:4:58,405 --> 0:4:58,88
You're on the team too.


134
0:4:58,88 --> 0:5:1,49
MALE SPEAKER: Were you
there when Gino did


135
0:5:1,49 --> 0:5:2,26
the backside heelflip?


136
0:5:2,26 --> 0:5:2,95
JASON DILL: No.


137
0:5:2,95 --> 0:5:4,7
I wasn't there when Gino did
the backside heelflip.


138
0:5:4,7 --> 0:5:6,85
I talked to Gino on the phone.


139
0:5:6,85 --> 0:5:8,82
I was just thinking about it,
when you mentioned that


140
0:5:8,82 --> 0:5:9,74
Spitfire video.


141
0:5:9,74 --> 0:5:12,59
What happened with the Spitfire
video was that I


142
0:5:12,59 --> 0:5:15,82
didn't ride for anybody except
for Spitfire and Thunder.


143
0:5:15,82 --> 0:5:20,59
And within that time frame, I
had already started filming


144
0:5:20,59 --> 0:5:24,345
with this dude Dave Sloshbach
that was friends with Brian


145
0:5:24,345 --> 0:5:28,0
Lotti that was trying to get
Gino and I to do this offshoot


146
0:5:28,0 --> 0:5:29,88
company, World Industries.


147
0:5:29,88 --> 0:5:33,53
And then, thank god, fucking
right before Brian Lotti left


148
0:5:33,53 --> 0:5:37,14
skateboarding, he left our
footage on Natas's desk.


149
0:5:37,14 --> 0:5:39,12
Natas had a desk to
leave footage on.


150
0:5:39,12 --> 0:5:41,15
Natas called Gino's house.


151
0:5:41,15 --> 0:5:44,4
I remember sitting there, being
like, fucking Natas is


152
0:5:44,4 --> 0:5:45,42
on the phone.


153
0:5:45,42 --> 0:5:48,16
And he was like, do you
want to ride for 101?


154
0:5:48,16 --> 0:5:51,425
So we got on 101, and
immediately released Snuff.


155
0:5:51,425 --> 0:5:56,41
It was the footage of us skating
just World and Blind,


156
0:5:56,41 --> 0:5:58,49
101 Plan B boards.


157
0:5:58,49 --> 0:6:0,83
MALE SPEAKER: I remember you
telling me one time that they


158
0:6:0,83 --> 0:6:3,45
saw your 101--


159
0:6:3,45 --> 0:6:5,779
whatever, your tape to get
on 101 or something.


160
0:6:5,779 --> 0:6:8,205
And [INAUDIBLE] or somebody was
like, oh yeah we like you.


161
0:6:8,205 --> 0:6:10,462
But I don't know about
your friend Gino.


162
0:6:10,462 --> 0:6:15,292



163
0:6:15,292 --> 0:6:17,24
Am I remembering that wrong?


164
0:6:17,24 --> 0:6:19,58
JASON DILL: There's no way
because Gino was already so


165
0:6:19,58 --> 0:6:25,56
well respected before he even
really hit that scene that I


166
0:6:25,56 --> 0:6:27,37
kind of went on his coattails.


167
0:6:27,37 --> 0:6:30,5
I think I had such a big mouth
when it came down to what my


168
0:6:30,5 --> 0:6:36,85
opinion was that the people that
I did business with were


169
0:6:36,85 --> 0:6:38,702
like, well this fucking little
loud-mouthed kid.


170
0:6:38,702 --> 0:6:40,6
He's so about it.


171
0:6:40,6 --> 0:6:41,8
Like, fuck it.


172
0:6:41,8 --> 0:6:42,5
Throw him out there.


173
0:6:42,5 --> 0:6:42,61
Let's see what he does.


174
0:6:42,61 --> 0:6:44,58
And I think I've been thrown out
there so many times to see


175
0:6:44,58 --> 0:6:48,6
what I can do that I ended
up just having to


176
0:6:48,6 --> 0:6:51,89
become as big as my--


177
0:6:51,89 --> 0:6:54,4
I thought my britches
were, or whatever.


178
0:6:54,4 --> 0:6:59,325
I know how anti-climactic it
sounds, but then I was pro.


179
0:6:59,325 --> 0:7:0,53
I don't really remember.


180
0:7:0,53 --> 0:7:3,28
And then the whole 101 thing
kind of turned into a really


181
0:7:3,28 --> 0:7:4,24
rad thing, though.


182
0:7:4,24 --> 0:7:7,32
Yeah, right after Snuff
was 20 Shot Sequence.


183
0:7:7,32 --> 0:7:11,14
And what happened was
I hurt my knee.


184
0:7:11,14 --> 0:7:14,16
I tore my ACL in half.


185
0:7:14,16 --> 0:7:16,83
Yeah, so that video came out
with a super small part, the


186
0:7:16,83 --> 0:7:17,83
20 Shot Sequence video.


187
0:7:17,83 --> 0:7:23,75
But Natas let me help him
edit that 101 section.


188
0:7:23,75 --> 0:7:26,88
My mom had seen enough of me
around the house and was just


189
0:7:26,88 --> 0:7:29,0
not stoked on how bummed
out I was, I'm sure.


190
0:7:29,0 --> 0:7:30,43
I'm sure she really
felt for me.


191
0:7:30,43 --> 0:7:33,76
And the very first clip
of me coming back is


192
0:7:33,76 --> 0:7:35,435
that line at Flushing.


193
0:7:35,435 --> 0:7:38,853
It's the first time I skated
in eight, nine months.


194
0:7:38,853 --> 0:7:39,93
MALE SPEAKER: What
was the line?


195
0:7:39,93 --> 0:7:42,38
JASON DILL: The heelflip over
the grate with the pipe,


196
0:7:42,38 --> 0:7:44,14
nollie backside [INAUDIBLE]
flat, switch 5-0, switch


197
0:7:44,14 --> 0:7:45,32
frontside 180 out.


198
0:7:45,32 --> 0:7:48,25
And that was the beginning
of Trilogy.


199
0:7:48,25 --> 0:7:49,86
Yeah, my part in that video
was fucking balls


200
0:7:49,86 --> 0:7:51,73
to the wall, man.


201
0:7:51,73 --> 0:7:54,51
I think that was everything I'd
ever achieved to bin was


202
0:7:54,51 --> 0:7:55,79
in that video part.


203
0:7:55,79 --> 0:7:58,94
Like, up until that point, I
think that's everything I ever


204
0:7:58,94 --> 0:8:0,0
worked for.


205
0:8:0,0 --> 0:8:1,11
Finally, like--


206
0:8:1,11 --> 0:8:4,9
Finally, like as gnarly as
Gino's part was in that video,


207
0:8:4,9 --> 0:8:6,78
I felt finally I had
my own niche.


208
0:8:6,78 --> 0:8:8,44
I achieved all my goals at 19.


209
0:8:8,44 --> 0:8:10,99
Anything after that was just
icing on the cake.


210
0:8:10,99 --> 0:8:13,31
By the time that came
out, Natas quit, and


211
0:8:13,31 --> 0:8:15,33
I got kicked off.


212
0:8:15,33 --> 0:8:20,95
So the day Trilogy came
out, I got kicked off.


213
0:8:20,95 --> 0:8:21,79
MALE SPEAKER: But
you're in it.


214
0:8:21,79 --> 0:8:22,54
JASON DILL: Yeah.


215
0:8:22,54 --> 0:8:22,948
MALE SPEAKER: And so--


216
0:8:22,948 --> 0:8:24,58
OK.


217
0:8:24,58 --> 0:8:25,5
Why'd they do that?


218
0:8:25,5 --> 0:8:28,64
JASON DILL: Because I stole
boards because I was--


219
0:8:28,64 --> 0:8:30,12
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, I
heard about that.


220
0:8:30,12 --> 0:8:31,4
JASON DILL: I had no money.


221
0:8:31,4 --> 0:8:34,7
Gino made $1,500 a month
and I made 1,000.


222
0:8:34,7 --> 0:8:37,402
One day we went to roll in the
streets and they were like,


223
0:8:37,402 --> 0:8:39,76
you're not getting
paid this month.


224
0:8:39,76 --> 0:8:42,13
With Trilogy about--


225
0:8:42,13 --> 0:8:45,65
Trilogy master tape, done.


226
0:8:45,65 --> 0:8:47,45
Parts, done.


227
0:8:47,45 --> 0:8:48,695
You're not getting paid.


228
0:8:48,695 --> 0:8:49,98
MALE SPEAKER: How many
boards did you steal?


229
0:8:49,98 --> 0:8:52,47
JASON DILL: 36.


230
0:8:52,47 --> 0:8:54,962
Because then I can get-- if I
had 36 boards I could pay my


231
0:8:54,962 --> 0:8:59,11
rent and get an ounce of pot.


232
0:8:59,11 --> 0:9:1,5
And then I'd just live off Top
Ramen and Kool-Aid like I'd


233
0:9:1,5 --> 0:9:2,255
been doing.


234
0:9:2,255 --> 0:9:13,83



235
0:9:13,83 --> 0:9:15,575
That Memory Screen
blew me away.


236
0:9:15,575 --> 0:9:17,38
If anybody's seen Memory
Screen, it just like--


237
0:9:17,38 --> 0:9:19,48
I remember [INAUDIBLE] like,
you were into it?


238
0:9:19,48 --> 0:9:22,78
Like a little kid, like
that whole first part?


239
0:9:22,78 --> 0:9:23,39
I was like, yes.


240
0:9:23,39 --> 0:9:24,64
Like the [MAKING SOUNDS].


241
0:9:24,64 --> 0:9:27,75



242
0:9:27,75 --> 0:9:29,73
I'd sing the song, that
middle section.


243
0:9:29,73 --> 0:9:32,52



244
0:9:32,52 --> 0:9:34,63
I can't forget to tell you
something that you're going to


245
0:9:34,63 --> 0:9:35,4
think is funny.


246
0:9:35,4 --> 0:9:36,49
You'll probably use
it, after this.


247
0:9:36,49 --> 0:9:39,61
But when I was skating for 23,
I was going to SF a lot,


248
0:9:39,61 --> 0:9:43,27
during that fit shit because
I rode for a


249
0:9:43,27 --> 0:9:45,25
company called C/O Wheels.


250
0:9:45,25 --> 0:9:47,62
C/O was short for cocaine.


251
0:9:47,62 --> 0:9:49,4
So stupid.


252
0:9:49,4 --> 0:9:51,524
What age is that, like 21?


253
0:9:51,524 --> 0:9:56,9
I was like 21 years old, going
to SF all the time, smoking


254
0:9:56,9 --> 0:9:59,3
cocaine blunts, being nutty.


255
0:9:59,3 --> 0:10:1,5
Like, turning into that weird
dude who would just take drugs


256
0:10:1,5 --> 0:10:3,745
when he's with you
and not tell you.


257
0:10:3,745 --> 0:10:5,92
Like, that was never me,
but I turned into that.


258
0:10:5,92 --> 0:10:8,28
It was a really strange
period.


259
0:10:8,28 --> 0:10:11,46
In my 23 ad, it's that ollie
over to frontside tailslide on


260
0:10:11,46 --> 0:10:14,51
that pole, where you have
to do the gap thing.


261
0:10:14,51 --> 0:10:18,56
Henry Sanchez had wrote, Michael
Bolton-ass looking


262
0:10:18,56 --> 0:10:19,74
motherfucker.


263
0:10:19,74 --> 0:10:24,66
And I remember being
so hurt by it.


264
0:10:24,66 --> 0:10:29,205
And then it just being one of
those things like, well fuck,


265
0:10:29,205 --> 0:10:31,89
at least one of the gnarly
dudes wrote it.


266
0:10:31,89 --> 0:10:32,15
Yeah.


267
0:10:32,15 --> 0:10:34,57
And then I remember being--


268
0:10:34,57 --> 0:10:36,14
towards the end of my contest
skating days--


269
0:10:36,14 --> 0:10:36,61
and I just--


270
0:10:36,61 --> 0:10:39,11
I went to a contest in Canada.


271
0:10:39,11 --> 0:10:42,69
And all I did was hang out
with Dyrdek and Kalis.


272
0:10:42,69 --> 0:10:46,92
I came home from that contest
and it said I rode for Alien


273
0:10:46,92 --> 0:10:49,54
Workshop in the new
Slap Magazine.


274
0:10:49,54 --> 0:10:52,98
So I called Chris Carter,
knowing him.


275
0:10:52,98 --> 0:10:58,65
And I was like, hey,
it says I ride for


276
0:10:58,65 --> 0:11:0,13
Workshop in the new magazine.


277
0:11:0,13 --> 0:11:1,75
I just want you to know
I have nothing--


278
0:11:1,75 --> 0:11:3,18
I didn't--


279
0:11:3,18 --> 0:11:3,74
that's not me.


280
0:11:3,74 --> 0:11:5,142
He's all, I know.


281
0:11:5,142 --> 0:11:7,405
And I think he said something
along the lines of like, no,


282
0:11:7,405 --> 0:11:8,11
we OKed it.


283
0:11:8,11 --> 0:11:9,53
That's cool.


284
0:11:9,53 --> 0:11:11,2
And they just knew.


285
0:11:11,2 --> 0:11:12,46
They knew I'd be riding for
Workshop because I tried to


286
0:11:12,46 --> 0:11:14,52
get on Workshop when I
got kicked off 101.


287
0:11:14,52 --> 0:11:16,32
Carter, he always calls
bullshit on it.


288
0:11:16,32 --> 0:11:19,5
But I remember getting
Memory Screen.


289
0:11:19,5 --> 0:11:20,615
It was yellow.


290
0:11:20,615 --> 0:11:23,23
It was a VHS, yellow tape.


291
0:11:23,23 --> 0:11:27,22
I liked Dinosaur Jr. I
knew who they were.


292
0:11:27,22 --> 0:11:28,77
Carter always calls--
no, you didn't.


293
0:11:28,77 --> 0:11:29,16
Fuck.


294
0:11:29,16 --> 0:11:29,72
Bullshit.


295
0:11:29,72 --> 0:11:31,512
You didn't know who--


296
0:11:31,512 --> 0:11:32,98
yeah, pfft.


297
0:11:32,98 --> 0:11:34,54
Just Alien Workshops
is just such a


298
0:11:34,54 --> 0:11:36,6
fucking sick, smart company.


299
0:11:36,6 --> 0:11:38,63
Like, I always adored them.


300
0:11:38,63 --> 0:11:41,3
And so it was a pleasure
to be at Workshop.


301
0:11:41,3 --> 0:11:42,3
It was really great.


302
0:11:42,3 --> 0:11:47,64
But the video that people always
come up to us about is


303
0:11:47,64 --> 0:11:49,74
the fucking Feedback video.


304
0:11:49,74 --> 0:11:52,59
People love that
goddamn video.


305
0:11:52,59 --> 0:11:55,5
And we put Ty through so much
shit making that video.


306
0:11:55,5 --> 0:11:57,435
Because we made that video
right before we put


307
0:11:57,435 --> 0:11:59,5
our Alien part out.


308
0:11:59,5 --> 0:12:1,36
Poor Ty was making that Feedback
video of us, like


309
0:12:1,36 --> 0:12:5,5
totally showing us, showcasing
us in that section.


310
0:12:5,5 --> 0:12:6,385
And we were like, fuck
this shit, Ty.


311
0:12:6,385 --> 0:12:8,6
We want to do our Alien part.


312
0:12:8,6 --> 0:12:9,5
Fuck a Transworld video.


313
0:12:9,5 --> 0:12:10,8
Fuck--


314
0:12:10,8 --> 0:12:11,28
Transworld video--


315
0:12:11,28 --> 0:12:12,48
what the fuck, Transworld.


316
0:12:12,48 --> 0:12:13,42
That's bullshit.


317
0:12:13,42 --> 0:12:14,79
We didn't know what it was
going to look like.


318
0:12:14,79 --> 0:12:17,25
And then that fucking Feedback
video came out.


319
0:12:17,25 --> 0:12:19,85
Everyone had just the
raddest parts in it.


320
0:12:19,85 --> 0:12:23,19
Kids that were born when that
part came out still


321
0:12:23,19 --> 0:12:25,7
come up at a demo.


322
0:12:25,7 --> 0:12:25,77
Feedback.


323
0:12:25,77 --> 0:12:27,86
They love that video.


324
0:12:27,86 --> 0:12:29,73
CHRIS CARTER: Dude, you got--
this is your big video.


325
0:12:29,73 --> 0:12:30,25
This is it.


326
0:12:30,25 --> 0:12:31,76
JASON DILL: OK, OK, OK, OK.


327
0:12:31,76 --> 0:12:32,752
All right.


328
0:12:32,752 --> 0:12:33,57
No problems.


329
0:12:33,57 --> 0:12:34,6
I'm only skating.


330
0:12:34,6 --> 0:12:35,12
I'm just skating.


331
0:12:35,12 --> 0:12:35,86
I swear.


332
0:12:35,86 --> 0:12:36,78
That's it.


333
0:12:36,78 --> 0:12:37,24
That's all.


334
0:12:37,24 --> 0:12:40,2
So far I heard I got the last
part and all that shit.


335
0:12:40,2 --> 0:12:40,73
So [INAUDIBLE]


336
0:12:40,73 --> 0:12:41,96
so psyched.


337
0:12:41,96 --> 0:12:43,0
CHRIS CARTER: You know
what the last part


338
0:12:43,0 --> 0:12:43,98
means, don't you?


339
0:12:43,98 --> 0:12:44,81
JASON DILL: I do!


340
0:12:44,81 --> 0:12:46,59
CHRIS CARTER: That's
the curtains.


341
0:12:46,59 --> 0:12:48,42
JASON DILL: A lot of people
don't believe this, but they


342
0:12:48,42 --> 0:12:51,85
started recording me for about
a year straight without


343
0:12:51,85 --> 0:12:53,23
telling me.


344
0:12:53,23 --> 0:12:56,85
So what you see in
Photosynthesis is a mixture of


345
0:12:56,85 --> 0:12:59,38
conversations me and Carter
had over a year.


346
0:12:59,38 --> 0:13:1,64
And that's not Carter
you see at the desk.


347
0:13:1,64 --> 0:13:5,0
It's just a stock photo they
found of some guy at a desk.


348
0:13:5,0 --> 0:13:9,23
My mom thought that was Carter
for years until she met him.


349
0:13:9,23 --> 0:13:11,91
Photosynthesis took about
two years of work-work.


350
0:13:11,91 --> 0:13:18,14
I think for so long, I always
felt that this is what I'm


351
0:13:18,14 --> 0:13:19,8
going to do.


352
0:13:19,8 --> 0:13:21,98
I'd want to be individualistic,
and I'd want


353
0:13:21,98 --> 0:13:24,24
people to know me for me
and not part of some


354
0:13:24,24 --> 0:13:26,85
big team, or whatever.


355
0:13:26,85 --> 0:13:28,63
MALE SPEAKER: Everyone always
talks about the walking down


356
0:13:28,63 --> 0:13:29,35
the stairs.


357
0:13:29,35 --> 0:13:31,21
JASON DILL: No, I just
thought it worked.


358
0:13:31,21 --> 0:13:33,6
I was trying to film
a line and--


359
0:13:33,6 --> 0:13:33,42
what was it?


360
0:13:33,42 --> 0:13:35,6
Originally, it was
just a backside


361
0:13:35,6 --> 0:13:36,96
heelflip over that barricade.


362
0:13:36,96 --> 0:13:39,59
And so then I started doing this
stupid fucking 360 flip


363
0:13:39,59 --> 0:13:43,85
that I ate shit on so bad up
at the top of the street.


364
0:13:43,85 --> 0:13:48,69
And that spot got demolished
after 9/11.


365
0:13:48,69 --> 0:13:52,65
But what it was-- like, you
cruise down this small street,


366
0:13:52,65 --> 0:13:54,62
and the fakie shuvit over the
bench because I've always


367
0:13:54,62 --> 0:13:55,28
loved that trick.


368
0:13:55,28 --> 0:13:56,49
No one does that very much.


369
0:13:56,49 --> 0:13:59,33
And then to pick
up the board--


370
0:13:59,33 --> 0:14:1,26
I just figured it would transfer
so well to walk down


371
0:14:1,26 --> 0:14:3,938
the stairs.


372
0:14:3,938 --> 0:14:4,94
One, two, three, four, down!


373
0:14:4,94 --> 0:14:7,14
And then I jumped that.


374
0:14:7,14 --> 0:14:9,55
That was a pretty fucking big
gap that was there then.


375
0:14:9,55 --> 0:14:12,54
I was a much younger
man at the time.


376
0:14:12,54 --> 0:14:14,29
It's just part of the video.


377
0:14:14,29 --> 0:14:16,3
And then just the reaction I've
gotten out of that over


378
0:14:16,3 --> 0:14:17,57
the years is just insane.


379
0:14:17,57 --> 0:14:18,55
MALE SPEAKER: So then--


380
0:14:18,55 --> 0:14:22,47
then my brother Joe hit me in
the chin with a crowbar.


381
0:14:22,47 --> 0:14:24,43
I turned around and
talked to Joe.


382
0:14:24,43 --> 0:14:25,9
You know, why you [INAUDIBLE].


383
0:14:25,9 --> 0:14:26,39
It's not necessary.


384
0:14:26,39 --> 0:14:27,685
Don't hit me in the chin.


385
0:14:27,685 --> 0:14:27,99
[INAUDIBLE]


386
0:14:27,99 --> 0:14:29,54
I don't like, OK?


387
0:14:29,54 --> 0:14:32,24
Joe comes over, has a gun,
shoos me in the stomach,


388
0:14:32,24 --> 0:14:34,6
shoots another guy over
there really fast.


389
0:14:34,6 --> 0:14:35,57
Shoots him down.


390
0:14:35,57 --> 0:14:36,415
[MAKING GUN SOUNDS]


391
0:14:36,415 --> 0:14:37,45
Right?


392
0:14:37,45 --> 0:14:39,29
Everybody's freaking
out, going crazy.


393
0:14:39,29 --> 0:14:41,14
I'm like, Joe, stop shooting
everybody, man.


394
0:14:41,14 --> 0:14:42,4
This is crazy!


395
0:14:42,4 --> 0:14:44,44
Those people are going to die!


396
0:14:44,44 --> 0:14:45,64
