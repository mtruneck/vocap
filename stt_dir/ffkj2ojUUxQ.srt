0:0:1,25 --> 0:0:17,99



3
0:0:17,99 --> 0:0:19,64
MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: Militant
unionism in Belfast is


4
0:0:19,64 --> 0:0:21,3
localized in two communities--


5
0:0:21,3 --> 0:0:23,9
the Shankill, a mile and a
half road that lies just


6
0:0:23,9 --> 0:0:26,26
around the corner from the
Catholic Falls Road, and the


7
0:0:26,26 --> 0:0:29,68
hyper-British Protestant
enclaves of East Belfast.


8
0:0:29,68 --> 0:0:32,7
In the 1970s, the Shankill was
ground zero for loyalist


9
0:0:32,7 --> 0:0:35,96
paramilitaries, famously home
to the Shankill Butchers, a


10
0:0:35,96 --> 0:0:38,72
bloodthirsty group of killers
that targeted random Catholics


11
0:0:38,72 --> 0:0:40,41
for torture and execution.


12
0:0:40,41 --> 0:0:43,95
And in 1993, the IRA blew up a
chip shop on the Shankill,


13
0:0:43,95 --> 0:0:45,36
killing nine Protestants.


14
0:0:45,36 --> 0:0:47,215
Today, both the Shankill
and East Belfast


15
0:0:47,215 --> 0:0:48,53
are relatively peaceful.


16
0:0:48,53 --> 0:0:50,63
The locals are friendly
and accommodating.


17
0:0:50,63 --> 0:0:53,49
But with these monuments and
murals celebrating Ulster's


18
0:0:53,49 --> 0:0:56,24
contribution to World War I,
and more threateningly,


19
0:0:56,24 --> 0:0:58,6
various Protestant
paramilitaries, it can feel


20
0:0:58,6 --> 0:1:1,69
like an earlier,
uglier decade.


21
0:1:1,69 --> 0:1:4,67
Alastair introduced us to Rab,
a very connected and very


22
0:1:4,67 --> 0:1:7,18
influential guy in East Belfast
who attempted to


23
0:1:7,18 --> 0:1:10,58
explain the palpable anger we
were witnessing so many years


24
0:1:10,58 --> 0:1:13,5
after the Good Friday
agreement.


25
0:1:13,5 --> 0:1:17,9
RAB: Unfortunately, on these
interface areas, on both sides


26
0:1:17,9 --> 0:1:19,18
of the fence, you know,
it hasn't moved


27
0:1:19,18 --> 0:1:20,12
on for these people.


28
0:1:20,12 --> 0:1:22,77
Because one stone, one
brick is too much.


29
0:1:22,77 --> 0:1:25,65
There's no peace process
for these people.


30
0:1:25,65 --> 0:1:27,43
MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: We were
talking to Alastair, and he


31
0:1:27,43 --> 0:1:31,84
was saying that this kind of
stuff is not the kind of


32
0:1:31,84 --> 0:1:32,87
laundering of the 12th.


33
0:1:32,87 --> 0:1:36,46
But it's to make the 12th more
of a family type exercise,


34
0:1:36,46 --> 0:1:39,46
more for the kids, more
looking towards


35
0:1:39,46 --> 0:1:41,24
the history of Ulster.


36
0:1:41,24 --> 0:1:44,12
Whereas it's trying to get away
from something like this,


37
0:1:44,12 --> 0:1:46,4
which is more sectarian.


38
0:1:46,4 --> 0:1:46,93
I mean, what do you
think of that?


39
0:1:46,93 --> 0:1:49,95
RAB: Well, I think
they're here.


40
0:1:49,95 --> 0:1:51,96
If we went back five or six
years ago, you'd have had


41
0:1:51,96 --> 0:1:55,63
[INAUDIBLE], and you'd have
shows of strength.


42
0:1:55,63 --> 0:1:57,23
And you would have had all
types of different


43
0:1:57,23 --> 0:1:59,54
paramilitaries at these
here bonfires


44
0:1:59,54 --> 0:2:0,676
having a show of strength.


45
0:2:0,676 --> 0:2:2,51
You know, them days
is well gone.


46
0:2:2,51 --> 0:2:4,19
MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: For those
who aren't from Northern


47
0:2:4,19 --> 0:2:5,63
Ireland, taigs are Catholics?


48
0:2:5,63 --> 0:2:5,94
RAB: Yes.


49
0:2:5,94 --> 0:2:7,22
MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: So
kill all Catholics.


50
0:2:7,22 --> 0:2:9,56
That seems pretty provocative.


51
0:2:9,56 --> 0:2:10,24
RAB: It does.


52
0:2:10,24 --> 0:2:11,99
But whenever you go to the
backdrop of what's happened


53
0:2:11,99 --> 0:2:14,35
here over the last couple of
weeks, I mean, you have to


54
0:2:14,35 --> 0:2:17,7
remember from the Catholic
church across the road there,


55
0:2:17,7 --> 0:2:18,97
there was actually three
shots fired.


56
0:2:18,97 --> 0:2:22,44
There was actually a newspaper
photographer that was shot.


57
0:2:22,44 --> 0:2:24,68
And there was two individuals
from this community who were


58
0:2:24,68 --> 0:2:26,16
also shot and wounded.


59
0:2:26,16 --> 0:2:29,26
So that's just sort of
a direct response to


60
0:2:29,26 --> 0:2:30,4
that, I would say.


61
0:2:30,4 --> 0:2:32,86
There was no shots coming from
the marcher's community.


62
0:2:32,86 --> 0:2:34,58
The young people wouldn't be,
you know, getting back to that


63
0:2:34,58 --> 0:2:37,39
sort of rhetoric again
of kill all taigs


64
0:2:37,39 --> 0:2:38,93
MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: On the ground
in East Belfast, we


65
0:2:38,93 --> 0:2:41,88
were a long way from the
language of the peace process.


66
0:2:41,88 --> 0:2:44,75
Officially, paramilitary
activity is an unwanted relic


67
0:2:44,75 --> 0:2:47,8
of the past and danger
to the future.


68
0:2:47,8 --> 0:2:49,8
But in working class,
Protestant, and Catholic


69
0:2:49,8 --> 0:2:51,67
neighborhoods throughout the
city, we heard endless tales


70
0:2:51,67 --> 0:2:53,935
of attacks by sectarian enemies
and the worthlessness


71
0:2:53,935 --> 0:2:55,185
of the police force.


72
0:2:55,185 --> 0:3:21,29



73
0:3:21,29 --> 0:3:23,6
MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: We were
quietly told earlier in the


74
0:3:23,6 --> 0:3:25,11
day that it would be inadvisable
to show up at


75
0:3:25,11 --> 0:3:28,93
certain bonfires uninvited with
a camera crew in tow.


76
0:3:28,93 --> 0:3:31,61
So we went with Rab to a bonfire
in his neighborhood.


77
0:3:31,61 --> 0:3:32,64
He cleared the way.


78
0:3:32,64 --> 0:3:35,28
And everyone, we soon
discovered, listened to Rab.


79
0:3:35,28 --> 0:3:51,924



80
0:3:51,924 --> 0:3:53,174
FEMALE SPEAKER: We're
rocking it.


81
0:3:53,174 --> 0:4:29,69



82
0:4:29,69 --> 0:4:32,654
[DRUMS PLAYING]


83
0:4:32,654 --> 0:4:34,38
MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: Rab took us
into the local community


84
0:4:34,38 --> 0:4:36,76
center to listen to the bands
warming up for tomorrow's


85
0:4:36,76 --> 0:4:39,44
parade and pumping up the crowd
with songs celebrating


86
0:4:39,44 --> 0:4:40,785
their British-ness.


87
0:4:40,785 --> 0:5:8,1
[MUSIC PLAYING]


88
0:5:8,1 --> 0:5:9,99
MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: The bonfire
organizers seemed to be


89
0:5:9,99 --> 0:5:13,27
experienced in the art of
Molotov cocktail production.


90
0:5:13,27 --> 0:5:16,32
And they generously allowed me,
after a bit of pleading,


91
0:5:16,32 --> 0:5:19,27
to take part in the burning of
this tower of flags, political


92
0:5:19,27 --> 0:5:21,706
posters, and symbols
of Catholicism.


93
0:5:21,706 --> 0:5:24,47
I do want to point out that
there's a big canister of


94
0:5:24,47 --> 0:5:25,63
petrol right there.


95
0:5:25,63 --> 0:5:27,183
Everybody seems to
be OK so far.


96
0:5:27,183 --> 0:5:32,44
But I'm anticipating a major
accident and major burns.


97
0:5:32,44 --> 0:5:34,44
But it's all for William
of Orange.


98
0:5:34,44 --> 0:5:45,52



99
0:5:45,52 --> 0:5:46,77
It's like [INAUDIBLE].


100
0:5:46,77 --> 0:5:51,2



101
0:5:51,2 --> 0:5:53,36
[CHEERS]


102
0:5:53,36 --> 0:5:55,78
MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: My first
Molotov cocktail, or petrol


103
0:5:55,78 --> 0:5:58,45
bomb experience was a bit
anti-climactic because it was


104
0:5:58,45 --> 0:5:59,82
kind of a shitty throw.


105
0:5:59,82 --> 0:6:2,4
But they lit it while
they were explaining


106
0:6:2,4 --> 0:6:3,505
how to throw it.


107
0:6:3,505 --> 0:6:4,575
It just was on fire.


108
0:6:4,575 --> 0:6:6,27
I had to get rid of it.


109
0:6:6,27 --> 0:6:9,0
Everywhere we turned, there were
gasoline cans just inches


110
0:6:9,0 --> 0:6:12,13
from enormous, terrifying fires,
kids full of cider


111
0:6:12,13 --> 0:6:14,8
falling off of flaming
pallets.


112
0:6:14,8 --> 0:6:16,92
But it was a friendly drunken
crowd, a happy celebration


113
0:6:16,92 --> 0:6:18,17
amongst tribal peers.


114
0:6:18,17 --> 0:6:40,1



115
0:6:40,1 --> 0:6:42,12
MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: But this was
the night before the July 12


116
0:6:42,12 --> 0:6:44,255
march, a warm-up for
the main event.


117
0:6:44,255 --> 0:6:46,91
The real action would be
tomorrow, the day of Northern


118
0:6:46,91 --> 0:6:49,93
Ireland's most contentious
parade when Protestants march


119
0:6:49,93 --> 0:6:52,24
and, in a few areas of the
city, Catholics try to


120
0:6:52,24 --> 0:6:53,59
confront them.


121
0:6:53,59 --> 0:6:56,205
And all of this only weeks after
another major flare-up


122
0:6:56,205 --> 0:6:58,22
of sectarian violence
in Belfast.
