0:0:1,67 --> 0:0:1,93
NIMROD KAMER: Venice 2012.


3
0:0:1,93 --> 0:0:5,95
The 69th annual film festival.


4
0:0:5,95 --> 0:0:9,6
I had arrived in style to
conduct an investigation.


5
0:0:9,6 --> 0:0:12,66
I had questions, like how can
I get myself trending, make


6
0:0:12,66 --> 0:0:14,356
cash like Kim Kardashian?


7
0:0:14,356 --> 0:0:19,23
How can I become richer than
producer Harvey Weinstein?


8
0:0:19,23 --> 0:0:22,43
I am the most favorite, a social
climate disguised as a


9
0:0:22,43 --> 0:0:25,4
journalist, and this
is my film--


10
0:0:25,4 --> 0:0:29,5
How to Make It #Huge in
the Film Industry--


11
0:0:29,5 --> 0:0:30,3
and also get laid.


12
0:0:30,3 --> 0:0:34,13



13
0:0:34,13 --> 0:0:37,19
Everyone knows the quickest way
to get famous is to get


14
0:0:37,19 --> 0:0:39,17
sued for defamation.


15
0:0:39,17 --> 0:0:42,72
So I headed to Hotel Danieli and
bumped into my old chum,


16
0:0:42,72 --> 0:0:43,97
Pierce Brosnan.


17
0:0:43,97 --> 0:0:46,6
I wanted to tell him all along
about this ridic videotape I


18
0:0:46,6 --> 0:0:47,73
found on eBay.


19
0:0:47,73 --> 0:0:49,55
I said, about the sex tape.


20
0:0:49,55 --> 0:0:50,95
You and a girl, she's shouting,


21
0:0:50,95 --> 0:0:52,8
Daniel Craig, fuck me.


22
0:0:52,8 --> 0:0:54,62
PIERCE BROSNAN: Yeah?


23
0:0:54,62 --> 0:0:55,71
NIMROD KAMER: And
I can sell it.


24
0:0:55,71 --> 0:0:56,83
I have one copy.


25
0:0:56,83 --> 0:0:59,27
I hear different girls keep
talking to you as, like, the


26
0:0:59,27 --> 0:1:0,41
name of the guy you played.


27
0:1:0,41 --> 0:1:2,2
And they want someone
else in bed.


28
0:1:2,2 --> 0:1:4,4
It keeps happening to me.


29
0:1:4,4 --> 0:1:6,88
I had only just arrived, and
things were already starting


30
0:1:6,88 --> 0:1:8,73
to get a bit awk.


31
0:1:8,73 --> 0:1:12,54
I ran away until I found myself
in Piazza San Marco and


32
0:1:12,54 --> 0:1:13,79
treated myself to a dessert.


33
0:1:13,79 --> 0:1:22,73



34
0:1:22,73 --> 0:1:26,24
Next song, maybe, Cyndi Lauper,
"Time After Time," if


35
0:1:26,24 --> 0:1:27,39
you have it?


36
0:1:27,39 --> 0:1:28,64
Cyndi Lauper.


37
0:1:28,64 --> 0:1:31,31



38
0:1:31,31 --> 0:1:33,49
If you have it.


39
0:1:33,49 --> 0:1:36,18
Maybe, yeah, some--


40
0:1:36,18 --> 0:1:40,45



41
0:1:40,45 --> 0:1:44,33
My life needed to be
a bit more TMZ.


42
0:1:44,33 --> 0:1:46,92
So the next morning, I headed
to the press room to spread


43
0:1:46,92 --> 0:1:48,94
rumors about myself.


44
0:1:48,94 --> 0:1:53,34
I have this interesting
story to sell.


45
0:1:53,34 --> 0:1:57,63
It's about Selena Gomez, the
Justin Bieber girlfriend?


46
0:1:57,63 --> 0:2:1,351
I sold her some MDMAC,
some drugs.


47
0:2:1,351 --> 0:2:4,29
And so she bought my drugs,
and I have some photos.


48
0:2:4,29 --> 0:2:9,11
I have a story about Ryan
Reynolds, the celeb--


49
0:2:9,11 --> 0:2:10,85
the actor who is dating
Blake Lively.


50
0:2:10,85 --> 0:2:13,31
I saw him having sex
with another man.


51
0:2:13,31 --> 0:2:15,79
I'll sell you the story.


52
0:2:15,79 --> 0:2:18,3
I know the guy who
was with him.


53
0:2:18,3 --> 0:2:21,71
I have some photos.


54
0:2:21,71 --> 0:2:25,26
And then I have some photos
of me going down on her.


55
0:2:25,26 --> 0:2:28,908
Because I shot it like that, on
the camera, when I go down.


56
0:2:28,908 --> 0:2:32,55
If you want later, it's 250
euros, just one photo--


57
0:2:32,55 --> 0:2:33,53
JPEG, 100k.


58
0:2:33,53 --> 0:2:36,39
Because I'm the guy who's
with Ryan Reynolds.


59
0:2:36,39 --> 0:2:39,27
I spent a night with him, OK?


60
0:2:39,27 --> 0:2:43,35



61
0:2:43,35 --> 0:2:45,86
I needed to raise enough money
to buy 10,000 fake Twitter


62
0:2:45,86 --> 0:2:48,94
followers, so I went down to
sell some drugs that I had


63
0:2:48,94 --> 0:2:51,52
stolen from Lindsay
Lohan, aka LiLo.


64
0:2:51,52 --> 0:2:55,7
Do you want to buy some
drugs, like MDMA?


65
0:2:55,7 --> 0:2:57,18
I've got some small drugs
if you want, like--


66
0:2:57,18 --> 0:2:59,26
-Oh no, it's all right.


67
0:2:59,26 --> 0:3:1,51
NIMROD KAMER: I can give
you a discount.


68
0:3:1,51 --> 0:3:2,6
-[LAUGH]


69
0:3:2,6 --> 0:3:3,735
NIMROD KAMER: Just
to chillax, yeah.


70
0:3:3,735 --> 0:3:5,6
-OK.


71
0:3:5,6 --> 0:3:7,24
NIMROD KAMER: I found
out Will-I-Am


72
0:3:7,24 --> 0:3:9,34
Defoe was staying nearby.


73
0:3:9,34 --> 0:3:10,81
I knew this would
be an easy sell.


74
0:3:10,81 --> 0:3:11,4
How are you doing?


75
0:3:11,4 --> 0:3:12,12
WILLEM DEFOE: Hi there.


76
0:3:12,12 --> 0:3:12,97
NIMROD KAMER: I'm Mister
Kamer, I'm


77
0:3:12,97 --> 0:3:14,94
Mr. Brosnan's agent.


78
0:3:14,94 --> 0:3:15,205
WILLEM DEFOE: Yes?


79
0:3:15,205 --> 0:3:16,37
NIMROD KAMER: And I just
came to meet you.


80
0:3:16,37 --> 0:3:17,81
Just come by and say hi, yeah.


81
0:3:17,81 --> 0:3:19,0
WILLEM DEFOE: Ah, yeah, I didn't
know anything about it.


82
0:3:19,0 --> 0:3:20,46
We were just taking a nap.


83
0:3:20,46 --> 0:3:20,915
NIMROD KAMER: Oh yeah?


84
0:3:20,915 --> 0:3:22,62
WILLEM DEFOE: And now we
have to catch a boat.


85
0:3:22,62 --> 0:3:23,51
NIMROD KAMER: I'm his agent.


86
0:3:23,51 --> 0:3:23,82
And--


87
0:3:23,82 --> 0:3:24,23
WILLEM DEFOE: I see.


88
0:3:24,23 --> 0:3:25,8
I see.


89
0:3:25,8 --> 0:3:27,26
NIMROD KAMER: I can represent
to you, as well, obviously.


90
0:3:27,26 --> 0:3:27,76
WILLEM DEFOE: Um--


91
0:3:27,76 --> 0:3:30,45
-We're going now to eat.


92
0:3:30,45 --> 0:3:30,518
We'll tell you what--


93
0:3:30,518 --> 0:3:31,7
WILLEM DEFOE: Now we
have to catch--


94
0:3:31,7 --> 0:3:33,74
NIMROD KAMER: OK, and Pierce
said to deliver you like this,


95
0:3:33,74 --> 0:3:37,2
if you want to just a small
MDMSAG, if you want


96
0:3:37,2 --> 0:3:38,5
to, like, go ahead.


97
0:3:38,5 --> 0:3:39,8
If you want to try it.


98
0:3:39,8 --> 0:3:40,552
Whatever, yeah.


99
0:3:40,552 --> 0:3:41,436
He's downstairs.


100
0:3:41,436 --> 0:3:42,686
Cheers.


101
0:3:42,686 --> 0:3:48,45



102
0:3:48,45 --> 0:3:49,84
I didn't want to be
seen with Willem.


103
0:3:49,84 --> 0:3:52,74
He hasn't made a good film
since Spider Man 3.


104
0:3:52,74 --> 0:3:53,89
So [INAUDIBLE]


105
0:3:53,89 --> 0:3:57,86
sisters shoved the whole bag of
MDMAGCSC up my bum, and we


106
0:3:57,86 --> 0:3:59,524
got down to it.


107
0:3:59,524 --> 0:4:10,77
[MUSIC PLAYING]


108
0:4:10,77 --> 0:6:10,77
