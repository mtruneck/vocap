###0 CAL ELLIOTT: Ch-ch-ch-chpfff.
###3 You just use the russet potatoes for any Okies.
###7 I grew up in Idaho and then I fished in
###9 Alaska for nine years.
###11 I moved to New York in '93.
###13 I ended up cooking.
###15 My cooking career was going OK.
###17 And so I thought I'm ready to start my own place.
###19 People said that they would back me or help me source out,
###22 just get into something.
###23 And so I got into something.
###26 And the economy went to shit and nobody showed up.
###28 We didn't have any money when we opened.
###30 Somehow I got a loan from a credit union in the Bronx that
###33 saved us in the 11th hour.
###36 A lot of people sat around and watched me drown.
###38 And at that point I was like, you know what?
###40 If I go down, I just go down on my own.
###43 I'd rather just not make any money and feel good
###46 about what I'm doing.
###47 
###52 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###65 CAL ELLIOTT: My name is Cal Elliott, and I'm the Chef and
###67 Owner of Rye Restaurant in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.
###70 Rye does simple American food.
###73 We try to be market-driven.
###75 Driven by the seasons.
###78 Every dish makes sense here.
###80 Food that you recognize, and it makes you feel good, and
###85 full, and satisfied.
###88 I hate to say comfort food, because
###90 that gets thrown around.
###92 And you just think mac and cheese or something, and it's
###94 a lot more involved than that.
###95 I think we do duck really well, but we
###97 always play with it.
###98 Like, sometimes I'll serve it with curried lentils, with
###101 different marinades.
###103 We finish it with a little curry butter.
###105 We do everything in-house, so we try to
###107 take care of the product.
###109 The meatloaf is veal, pork, beef.
###111 And then we always have duck scraps.
###113 So we have all the duck tenders, so we grind those up.
###115 And it basically ends up almost like a tureen
###117 once you slice it.
###120 It offers somebody an easy out.
###121 Like, you don't have a lot of money but you're going out
###123 with the six type of friends.
###124 You're like, all right, I'll just get
###125 the meatloaf sandwich.
###127 I'm not interested in just cooking for rich people.
###129 And if someone can come and enjoy the space that doesn't
###131 have the money, and enjoy a nice meal, I'm all for it.
###137 We don't have the resources to really just work on a dish for
###141 three months and then be like ta da!
###143 Here we go.
###144 Here it is.
###144 So everything's kind of a work in progress.
###149 It's assumed that I'm supposed to have more
###151 thought behind things.
###152 But things are really just like, oh, fuck, I've never had
###154 a scotch egg.
###155 So let's make a scotch egg.
###156 It was a egg wrapped in sausage, deep-fried.
###159 I was like, who doesn't want that?
###162 And then you make it and you're like, oh, it's good,
###165 but it would be good with this.
###166 And then all of a sudden it's good with that.
###168 And the mornay sauce.
###170 Cheese on your deep-fried scotch egg?
###172 Like, of course.
###174 And it's perfect bar food.
###176 I mean, I guess it's interesting to see your food
###178 on a plate in the dining room.
###180 But when you cook it every night on your day off, it's
###182 like I'm constantly eating butter and rich food.
###185 And then I would just rather go out, when I go out, and eat
###189 simple food.
###190 
###192 It's no fair.
###193 You guys are ahead of me.
###196 CHUCK WHITE: You can catch up.
###198 SHEVAWN NORTON: Are you ready?
###200 CAL ELLIOTT: Yeah.
###200 Chuck and I are sick, man.
###202 We want some sake and some noodles.
###204 We went to Samurai Mama's on Grand Street.
###208 Who's the mama behind it?
###210 
###214 I don't go out very often.
###215 But when I do, I prefer to go out to places like Samurai
###219 Mama where Makoto is another chef/owner.
###223 You know that you're supporting the neighborhood.
###225 You're supporting someone who's put
###226 their life on the line.
###228 In this neighborhood, there's a restaurant
###230 that opens every day.
###231 And it's not easy.
###233 It makes it feel like a community, which is why I
###235 opened a restaurant where I live.
###237 SHEVAWN NORTON: Hi, Song.
###239 CAL ELLIOTT: One of our old employees, Song, is the
###241 manager there now.
###243 She actually dates Chuck.
###244 It's nice to go somewhere where you feel like people
###247 actually care a little bit about you.
###249 Cheers.
###250 
###252 SHEVAWN NORTON: I usually come here by myself
###254 and sit right here.
###256 And nobody bothers me.
###257 And it's very relaxing.
###259 CAL ELLIOTT: They got a good lunch special.
###260 We go out to lunch here sometimes, talk business.
###263 MAKOTO SUZUKI: Now we use this.
###265 Mm.
###267 Scallions!
###268 Scallions!
###269 
###272 This is just a deep-fried lotus root.
###275 CAL ELLIOTT: All right.
###276 Look at that.
###278 Yeah, I love eating Japanese food.
###280 They season dishes differently.
###282 They might put something bland with something really salty so
###284 you make sure that you have to have it all together.
###287 MAKOTO SUZUKI: The scallop and sea urchin are from Hokkaido.
###290 This is a sea urchin paste.
###292 This is pretty salty, so this works as a sauce.
###295 You know what?
###296 I'm sure Cal loves this dish.
###298 So this is a present from me for Cal.
###300 CAL ELLIOTT: All right.
###302 What is that thing?
###303 Oh, nice.
###304 Thank you so much.
###305 You see how food makes everybody happy?
###307 We were all uncomfortable before.
###309 Oh my god, that looks delicious.
###311 I'm raw dogging the tempura.
###312 CHUCK WHITE: I'm going to bareback the squash.
###317 CAL ELLIOTT: Shevawn, you must love this because they give
###318 you a little of everything.
###319 You love that.
###319 SHEVAWN NORTON: I know.
###320 I love that.
###320 CAL ELLIOTT: That's what's great about going somewhere
###322 where you know people.
###323 They just send stuff out.
###324 I really enjoy that when people kind of leave it in
###328 your hands.
###328 Because you get to give them dishes that you feel good
###330 about, with a lot of pride and all of that.
###333 MAKOTO SUZUKI: Mama's gyoza.
###334 This is a secret water.
###336 
###340 CAL ELLIOTT: Oh, the dumplings, nice.
###343 Do you know what this stuff is?
###344 Because this stuff is delicious.
###346 I need to learn how to make that, because that is the best
###348 thing in the world.
###350 That's seafood curry udon.
###354 SHEVAWN NORTON: Thank you.
###356 CAL ELLIOTT: This is awesome.
###357 [CHUCKLES].
###358 
###362 I'm having such a good time.
###364 I am.
###365 I might need you to stick your thumb up my ass so I can get
###367 some of this out so we can go to the next place.
###370 [LAUGHS].
###371 
###376 It's funny, we've spent a lot of time together, but the
###379 three of us don't-- we rarely--
###380 I think we've been out once, the three of us together.
###382 And you need to alleviate stress, and going out is a
###386 really nice thing to do.
###387 I wish I did it more often.
###391 We got very drunk at Samurai Mama.
###394 We were having some warm sake.
###395 I'm a little under the weather.
###397 Then the shots didn't really go with anything we were doing
###400 other than helping us enjoy the meal.
###403 CHUCK WHITE: Song, you want a shot?
###404 CAL ELLIOTT: Thanks for having us.
###406 
###409 Ah, delicious.
###411 I guess they didn't have proper shot glasses.
###413 So it was like a flute of champagne shot.
###415 And we had like four four-ounce shots.
###417 No one was keeping up.
###418 I think I was the only one that was throwing them down by
###420 the end of it.
###421 Say hello to Lisa.
###422 Hello, Lisa.
###424 Did you just hypocrite me?
###425 She tried to stop me, but I wasn't having it.
###427 SHEVAWN NORTON: You have to go back and cook.
###429 So just letting you--
###430 CAL ELLIOTT: Oh, fuck, I have to cook.
###432 The whole staff is going to be wasted.
###434 It's going to be just like Christmas party, and then I
###436 got to do it.
###436 [HICCUPS]
###439 Bullshit.
###440 Thank you, guys.
###441 Everything was delicious.
###442 MAKOTO SUZUKI: Arigato.
###443 Thank you.
###444 CAL ELLIOTT: After Samurai Mama's we came back here so I
###446 could cook for everybody, which was pretty hilarious.
###452 Oh, man.
###455 Can I just tell everybody, we had the best
###459 meal at Samurai Mama's!
###461 -Really?
###461 CAL ELLIOTT: Oh my god!
###464 If you guys have never had a barrel of
###466 cabbage, it's delicious.
###468 You're coming in.
###469 You have to come inside.
###471 Yeah, don't you dare not come inside.
###473 Hey man, everybody's still here.
###475 They're still here, yeah.
###477 They lay downtown roots and they stay.
###481 [CHEERING]
###484 -The champ is here!
###485 CAL ELLIOTT: That's right.
###486 That's fucking right.
###488 -The champ is here!
###489 CAL ELLIOTT: You can't get drunk and eat by yourself.
###492 Everybody's about to go home and it's like 3 o'clock.
###495 And they knew you were there until 5:00 in the morning.
###497 Those nights that you don't get back,
###499 they're just the best.
###501 So if it wasn't humbling enough to go eat beautiful
###503 food at Samurai Mama's, we came back here so I could burn
###507 grilled cheese.
###508 We're going to grill some cheese.
###510 Make some grilled cheese sandwiches.
###512 So basically, we're going to see how this goes, because
###514 we're all guinea pigs.
###517 This is one of those things, like this sandwich
###519 has been in my head.
###521 I've never tried this at all.
###524 We have a great short rib.
###526 To me, this would be a delicious grilled cheese.
###529 I was thinking about that sandwich for brunch, actually.
###531 I mean, it's like the most kick-ass patty
###533 melt you could get.
###534 I thought it would be easy to make a sandwich.
###537 Turned out to be a little more trying than I thought.
###540 I was wasted.
###541 And I'm like, everybody's going to get a grilled cheese,
###544 which was fucking ridiculous.
###546 Like immediately I had too many pans going.
###548 I thought I turned that off.
###550 I turned it up.
###552 That's going to be a disaster.
###554 -Let's see his secret to drunk cooking.
###557 CAL ELLIOTT: Don't be drunk.
###560 So any imperfections in this sandwich is like 100% to do
###564 with the cook.
###565 I didn't follow the steps because I drank too much and I
###568 didn't give a fuck.
###570 And that's Cooking 101.
###572 Every step of the way, you have to care.
###576 And one step you skip, you end up with what we have tonight,
###580 which is a piece of shit.
###582 
###586 MILTON CHAUCA: No, [INAUDIBLE].
###587 CAL ELLIOTT: No, you.
###587 You, my friend, man, Milton.
###589 This guy, Gladys--
###593 Gladys and I have worked together eight years.
###595 Milton and I, 12 years.
###596 You know how you know these guys are awesome?
###598 Because they came to save me.
###600 They're like, I know he's going to fuck everything up.
###602 And they came to save me.
###604 Yours is burnt.
###607 MILTON CHAUCA: It's OK.
###608 I don't care.
###609 
###613 CAL ELLIOTT: It's a good sandwich though.
###615 Cheers, man.
###616 Thank you so much.
###618 This guy's awesome, by the way.
###619 DANNY MINCH: Aw, dude!
###620 We were about to kiss right there.
###621 What the fuck?
###622 CAL ELLIOTT: Did you get that?
###624 DANNY MINCH: I tried to go right and he went left.
###625 CAL ELLIOTT: I mouthed him.
###626 I mouthed him.
###626 DANNY MINCH: That was like a bad pick and roll.
###628 What the fuck?
###629 CAL ELLIOTT: I'm going to talk to Elizabeth, I talk to her.
###631 I don't care.
###632 DANNY MINCH: I don't think my wife's going to like that.
###634 CAL ELLIOTT: I need your money.
###635 DANNY MINCH: She's not going to like three things.
###636 CAL ELLIOTT: He makes money.
###637 He knows how to make money.
###638 DANNY MINCH: Ai yi yi.
###638 CAL ELLIOTT: I can cook food.
###639 He knows how to make money.
###641
