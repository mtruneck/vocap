4
0:0:23,712 --> 0:0:26,2
WADE DAVIS: I did what one would
do, is you take all this


5
0:0:26,2 --> 0:0:29,86
stuff back for taxonomic
identification.


6
0:0:29,86 --> 0:0:32,203
You look in the literature to
see if there's any reports on


7
0:0:32,203 --> 0:0:33,44
what it might have.


8
0:0:33,44 --> 0:0:35,91
It was a mix, a plethora
of ingredients--


9
0:0:35,91 --> 0:0:43,41
everything from snakes, dried
toads, and various plants, and


10
0:0:43,41 --> 0:0:46,91
then these curious fish.


11
0:0:46,91 --> 0:0:48,65
HAMILTON MORRIS: While Alex
arranges a meeting with a new


12
0:0:48,65 --> 0:0:52,5
bokor, I decide to see if I can
find the ingredients Davis


13
0:0:52,5 --> 0:0:56,275
described on my own.


14
0:0:56,275 --> 0:0:59,67
WADE DAVIS: I identified the
plants and the amphibians.


15
0:0:59,67 --> 0:1:2,0
And I finally went around
to the fish guys.


16
0:1:2,0 --> 0:1:4,37
And I found this ichthyologist,
literally with


17
0:1:4,37 --> 0:1:8,39
his head sort of inside this big
jaw of some massive fish


18
0:1:8,39 --> 0:1:10,8
he was counting the teeth
of or something.


19
0:1:10,8 --> 0:1:15,65
And he literally reached up
and pulled from his shelf,


20
0:1:15,65 --> 0:1:19,44
between these dusty volumes of
the journal of ichthyology, a


21
0:1:19,44 --> 0:1:23,77
copy of Ian Fleming's James Bond
book, "From Russia With


22
0:1:23,77 --> 0:1:28,6
Love, one of those early books
in the James Bond saga.


23
0:1:28,6 --> 0:1:31,1
007 gets kicked in the
shin, and he dies.


24
0:1:31,1 --> 0:1:33,61
And then he turns back alive
in the next book.


25
0:1:33,61 --> 0:1:38,41
That's how the guy in the lab
introduced me to the fact that


26
0:1:38,41 --> 0:1:39,985
I had really landed
on something.


27
0:1:39,985 --> 0:1:49,265



28
0:1:49,265 --> 0:1:51,41
HAMILTON MORRIS: The pufferfish
is a marvel of


29
0:1:51,41 --> 0:1:53,44
evolution and biomechanics.


30
0:1:53,44 --> 0:1:56,51
Its internal organs contain
one of the most potent


31
0:1:56,51 --> 0:1:59,4
neurotoxins ever discovered.


32
0:1:59,4 --> 0:2:3,48
It is the TTX in the pufferfish
which induces the


33
0:2:3,48 --> 0:2:6,47
total body flaccid
paralysis, almost


34
0:2:6,47 --> 0:2:9,165
indistinguishable from death.


35
0:2:9,165 --> 0:2:12,16
WADE DAVIS: The simple
identification of the fish


36
0:2:12,16 --> 0:2:16,31
suddenly took the whole zombie
investigation from the realm


37
0:2:16,31 --> 0:2:20,565
of the phantasmagoric into the
realm of the conceivable.


38
0:2:20,565 --> 0:2:35,59



39
0:2:35,59 --> 0:2:40,99
The fish that were used in the
poisons had a very interesting


40
0:2:40,99 --> 0:2:47,2
molecule in their viscera, in
their liver, in their ovaries,


41
0:2:47,2 --> 0:2:49,0
and on the surface
of the skin.


42
0:2:49,0 --> 0:2:53,2
And this was a neurotoxin called
tetrodotoxin, which is


43
0:2:53,2 --> 0:2:55,44
a complex molecule.


44
0:2:55,44 --> 0:3:0,97
It's about 160,000 times more
potent than cocaine as an


45
0:3:0,97 --> 0:3:2,26
anesthetic.


46
0:3:2,26 --> 0:3:7,101
It's about 1,000 times more
toxic than potassium cyanide.


47
0:3:7,101 --> 0:3:10,666
A lethal dose of the pure
molecule would balance on the


48
0:3:10,666 --> 0:3:11,81
head of a pin.


49
0:3:11,81 --> 0:3:15,54
But more interesting than the
sheer toxicity was the way


50
0:3:15,54 --> 0:3:16,64
that it killed.


51
0:3:16,64 --> 0:3:19,96
And we knew the poison could
do just what was necessary.


52
0:3:19,96 --> 0:3:23,74
It mechanically blocks cilium
channels in the nerves, which


53
0:3:23,74 --> 0:3:27,98
brought on peripheral paralysis,
dramatically low


54
0:3:27,98 --> 0:3:31,19
metabolic rates, and yet
consciousness was retained


55
0:3:31,19 --> 0:3:32,44
until the moment of death.

HAMILTON MORRIS: He got it.


63
0:4:30,524 --> 0:4:31,95
It's all puffed up.


64
0:4:31,95 --> 0:4:34,7
Oh my god.


65
0:4:34,7 --> 0:4:36,51
The fish is shot with
a spear gun and


66
0:4:36,51 --> 0:4:37,96
pulled out of the water.


67
0:4:37,96 --> 0:4:40,61
The entry wound is close to the
brain, with an exit wound


68
0:4:40,61 --> 0:4:41,165
in the stomach.

HAMILTON MORRIS: Oh, wow.


73
0:4:52,23 --> 0:4:53,51
Look, he's puffing up.


74
0:4:53,51 --> 0:4:56,42
Much to my astonishment, when
it's pulled out of the water,


75
0:4:56,42 --> 0:5:0,2
it begins to inflate itself,
despite the two gaping holes


76
0:5:0,2 --> 0:5:1,38
in its body.


77
0:5:1,38 --> 0:5:3,66
How is this possible?


78
0:5:3,66 --> 0:5:7,4
I tentatively identified the
fish as Diodon hystrix, a


79
0:5:7,4 --> 0:5:10,84
species so poisonous that people
have been hospitalized


80
0:5:10,84 --> 0:5:13,163
for merely touching
the spines.


81
0:5:13,163 --> 0:5:17,48
WADE DAVIS: The fish that I
found in Haiti being used in


82
0:5:17,48 --> 0:5:21,68
these preparations were members
of a pantropical order


83
0:5:21,68 --> 0:5:25,24
of fish called the
Tetraodonitiformes, which also


84
0:5:25,24 --> 0:5:28,5
include the famous fugu
fish of Japan,


85
0:5:28,5 --> 0:5:29,89
the culinary delicacy.


86
0:5:29,89 --> 0:5:33,94
For centuries, or certainly
for generations, specially


87
0:5:33,94 --> 0:5:38,315
trained chefs have been
preparing these toxic fish.


88
0:5:38,315 --> 0:5:43,75
They carefully eliminate the
toxin so that the person can


89
0:5:43,75 --> 0:5:47,36
enjoy the nontoxic fillets
of the fish.


90
0:5:47,36 --> 0:5:53,86
The real role of the fugu chef
is not to eliminate the toxin


91
0:5:53,86 --> 0:5:57,72
altogether but to reduce it
to the extent that the


92
0:5:57,72 --> 0:6:1,47
connoisseur still enjoys
the effects of a mild


93
0:6:1,47 --> 0:6:3,46
intoxication, which
include waves of


94
0:6:3,46 --> 0:6:5,44
euphoria, tingling sensation.


95
0:6:5,44 --> 0:6:8,25
It's one of the few substances
that walks a fine line between


96
0:6:8,25 --> 0:6:9,5
food and drug.


97
0:6:9,5 --> 0:6:17,615



98
0:6:17,615 --> 0:6:21,17
HAMILTON MORRIS: It sounds like
there's a biphasic thing,


99
0:6:21,17 --> 0:6:23,84
where it starts out with
the TTX poisoning.


100
0:6:23,84 --> 0:6:27,439
And then after, then they're
given scopolamine or atropine.


101
0:6:27,439 --> 0:6:29,62
WADE DAVIS: So we've talked,
for example, about the


102
0:6:29,62 --> 0:6:31,185
tetrodotoxin.


103
0:6:31,185 --> 0:6:36,0
But then what's fascinating is
that, by all accounts, as the


104
0:6:36,0 --> 0:6:41,9
zombie comes back around, he is
fed the paste of (CREOLE),


105
0:6:41,9 --> 0:6:43,635
the zombie's cucumber.


106
0:6:43,635 --> 0:6:49,8
Now this is based on datura,
and it includes, of course,


107
0:6:49,8 --> 0:6:53,724
these tropane alkaloids,
scopolamine and atropine.

109
0:6:55,11 --> 0:6:57,81



110
0:6:57,81 --> 0:6:59,88
HAMILTON MORRIS: Davis
hypothesized that the


111
0:6:59,88 --> 0:7:3,19
chemicals in the zombie cucumber
were used to keep the


112
0:7:3,19 --> 0:7:6,7
zombie in a state of submissive
confusion.


113
0:7:6,7 --> 0:7:7,32
There's one right there.


114
0:7:7,32 --> 0:7:11,39



115
0:7:11,39 --> 0:7:15,6
But I'm not so sure that this
is Datura stramonium.


116
0:7:15,6 --> 0:7:16,265
Oh, it has to be older?


117
0:7:16,265 --> 0:7:17,515
-Yeah.


118
0:7:17,515 --> 0:7:20,12



119
0:7:20,12 --> 0:7:23,12
WADE DAVIS: This would be the
perfect drug to kind of


120
0:7:23,12 --> 0:7:28,79
socialize the individual
into a new state of


121
0:7:28,79 --> 0:7:31,79
psychosis, if you will.


122
0:7:31,79 --> 0:7:34,2
These are powerfully
active drugs.


123
0:7:34,2 --> 0:7:37,49
They bring on a state of induced
psychotic delirium,


124
0:7:37,49 --> 0:7:43,36
visions of hellfire, a burning
thirst, a sensation of flight.


125
0:7:43,36 --> 0:7:45,96
These are the drugs of choice
of every black magician and


126
0:7:45,96 --> 0:7:48,8
sorcerer throughout the world.


127
0:7:48,8 --> 0:7:54,31
And they create kind of a
psychic dislocation that is


128
0:7:54,31 --> 0:7:58,55
described invariably by anyone
who takes the drug as being


129
0:7:58,55 --> 0:7:59,8
incredibly terrifying.


130
0:7:59,8 --> 0:8:3,684



131
0:8:3,684 --> 0:8:6,77
HAMILTON MORRIS: After the
preparation, which consists of


132
0:8:6,77 --> 0:8:10,22
a de-spining and crude
hepatectomy, the remaining


133
0:8:10,22 --> 0:8:12,67
organ meat it scrambled,
salted, and


134
0:8:12,67 --> 0:8:14,69
served on a silver dish.


135
0:8:14,69 --> 0:8:17,79
WADE DAVIS: There was this
enormous literature on just


136
0:8:17,79 --> 0:8:19,82
what these fish could
do to you.


137
0:8:19,82 --> 0:8:23,8
It turns out by folk custom in
Japan, if you succumb to fugu


138
0:8:23,8 --> 0:8:26,58
fish, you're laid on the ground
for several days to


139
0:8:26,58 --> 0:8:28,17
make sure you're really dead.


140
0:8:28,17 --> 0:8:31,5
And there are case after case
after case in the literature


141
0:8:31,5 --> 0:8:35,289
and in the newspapers of Japan
of people nailed into their


142
0:8:35,289 --> 0:8:37,929
coffins by mistake.


143
0:8:37,929 --> 0:8:41,669
On this dish is a species of
puffer, which is known to be


144
0:8:41,669 --> 0:8:45,73
poisonous, in October, a season
where the fish is known


145
0:8:45,73 --> 0:8:48,92
to contain deadly quantities
of TTX.


146
0:8:48,92 --> 0:8:51,53
Yet nobody around me seems
concerned in the slightest.


147
0:8:51,53 --> 0:9:0,55



148
0:9:0,55 --> 0:9:3,62
The meat is chewy, and I'm
delighted to say, tastes


149
0:9:3,62 --> 0:9:6,791
almost indistinguishable
from chicken.


150
0:9:6,791 --> 0:9:9,76
WADE DAVIS: At the time, no
one really understood the


151
0:9:9,76 --> 0:9:12,18
biogenesis of the toxin
within the fish.


152
0:9:12,18 --> 0:9:14,76
There was a tremendous amount
of variability.


153
0:9:14,76 --> 0:9:17,69
And we knew that 50% of the
time, these fish were not


154
0:9:17,69 --> 0:9:18,87
toxic at all.


155
0:9:18,87 --> 0:9:23,64
But what was fascinating is that
this meant that at least


156
0:9:23,64 --> 0:9:28,4
50% of the time, these toxins
would be ineffective,


157
0:9:28,4 --> 0:9:28,92
pharmacologically.


158
0:9:28,92 --> 0:9:30,533
So what's going on here?


159
0:9:30,533 --> 0:9:34,53
Well, that really turned out to
be the key to the puzzle.


160
0:9:34,53 --> 0:9:37,24
Every drug, in a sense,
particularly hallucinogenic


161
0:9:37,24 --> 0:9:41,69
drugs, they have absolutely
neutral potential for good or


162
0:9:41,69 --> 0:9:43,32
evil, an ambivalent potential.


163
0:9:43,32 --> 0:9:48,42
And everything depends on the
cultural matrix in which the


164
0:9:48,42 --> 0:9:49,67
drug is used.


165
0:9:49,67 --> 0:11:49,67
