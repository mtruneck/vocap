###4 Hey Food Tubers. I'm Tim Shieff, athlete, World Free Running
###8 Champion and also a vegan. After a workout a lot of people reach for a protein shake,
###13 but I realised that what you need to replace is the carbs. So I came up with an all natural,
###16 high carb smootie. Check it out, it's Datorade.
###22 I've only been a vegan for a year, I like tom keep things as simple as possible. So
###30 I chose the fruit with the highest carbs. Bananas and dates.
###33 Start things off, bananas. I want four of these. That's when you want to be blending
###37 them up when they're spotty, nice and ripe. Peel them, from the bottom. Bananas are 93%
###44 carbs, 3% fat, 4% protein so you're getting some protein in there as well. It really doesn't
###50 matter if they're bruised, they're getting blended up anyway.
###53 Natural sugars you've for in the banana which is helping to replace the glycogen you need
###58 to replace in your body after a workout. Another thing I like to do is scrape from
###61 the peel. You wouldn't want to eat that if you're eating from the banana, but blending
###65 it into a smoothie it really doesn't matter. I came up with these smoothie recipes. Just
###68 have fun with whole foods and see what you like.
###70 I've got four bananas in there, now you want to double up with the dates. I go 8 dates,
###75 two for every banana. Medjool are my favourite, look how gooey that
###80 is. It's like fudge caramel. You want to make sure there's no stone inside.
###85 These ones have already been de stoned. Put it in. These have really dense calories. That's
###91 2,3,4,5,6,7,8. I really enjoy cinnamon. I add it to almost
###94 everything I have, so one spoon of that. Also some ginger, gives it that nice little after
###100 kick then about one litre of water. Keeps you hydrated, which you really need
###105 to do as you are going throughout \the day. It;s important.
###107 If you're going all out and don't mind a bit of fat in there, you can use almond milk to
###111 make it a bit creamier. You can put other things. If you want to put a squeeze of lemon,
###114 it's all up to you. It's whatever you like, whatever you enjoy.
###116 Whatever you know is good for your body you can mix it in there as well. You might not
###119 even taste it so that's fine. Let's whizz it up.
###130 Alright, here it is. One big, fat datorade smoothie. I don't like to blend it too fine.
###146 Because it's nice to have a bit of dates to chew on as your drinking it, i think it's
###151 important. Banana and dates makes a nice caramel liquid
###155 here. Creamy like fudge drink. That is so sweet, so good post workout.
###169 So that's it, real simple, real delicious being vegan can be so sweet when you have
