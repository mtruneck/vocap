1
0:0:14,0 --> 0:0:19,0
*Sold*


2
0:0:19,0 --> 0:0:35,0
*Loan*


3
0:0:35,0 --> 0:0:37,0
The American Dream


4
0:0:37,0 --> 0:0:41,0
There's a reason they call it a dream.


5
0:0:41,0 --> 0:0:42,0
Who's there?


6
0:0:42,0 --> 0:0:45,0
Cock-a-doodle-do pal.


7
0:0:45,0 --> 0:0:48,0
*Foreclosed*


8
0:0:48,0 --> 0:0:51,0
No, no, no!


9
0:0:51,0 --> 0:0:52,0
I don't have any more money!


10
0:0:52,0 --> 0:0:55,0
My job sucks right now. Please!


11
0:0:55,0 --> 0:0:59,0
I'll have more money next month.


12
0:0:59,0 --> 0:1:1,0
You can't take my house!


13
0:1:1,0 --> 0:1:4,0
Is that your signature?


14
0:1:4,0 --> 0:1:7,0
Okay. Well, just help me work something out, okay?


15
0:1:7,0 --> 0:1:9,0
I mean, you said I'm a good credit guy, right? I mean...


16
0:1:9,0 --> 0:1:10,0
Hey, wait!


17
0:1:10,0 --> 0:1:12,0
My dog is in there!


18
0:1:12,0 --> 0:1:18,0
No! Don't take my Dream!


19
0:1:18,0 --> 0:1:28,0
Oh, how did this happen?


20
0:1:28,0 --> 0:1:29,0
Hartman?


21
0:1:29,0 --> 0:1:30,0
Is that you?!


22
0:1:30,0 --> 0:1:34,0
Been a long time since the fourth grade.


23
0:1:34,0 --> 0:1:41,76
*Fourth grade*


24
0:1:41,76 --> 0:1:43,0
Is that a time machine?


25
0:1:43,0 --> 0:1:47,0
There's no need to concern yourself with my stunning accomplishments.


26
0:1:47,0 --> 0:1:49,0
Best get in. There's not much time.


27
0:1:49,0 --> 0:1:52,0
I've got to go down to the bank and get my life back.


28
0:1:52,0 --> 0:1:54,0
They took everything.


29
0:1:54,0 --> 0:1:57,0
Oh, the bank ain't gonna help you now.


30
0:1:57,0 --> 0:1:59,0
Look in the trunk.


31
0:1:59,0 --> 0:2:1,0
Extra set of balls. Put them on. You're gonna need them.


32
0:2:1,0 --> 0:2:3,0
You're gonna get my dream back?


33
0:2:3,0 --> 0:2:11,0
No, you are. I'm here to show you how.


34
0:2:11,0 --> 0:2:12,0
*Winter of 2006*


35
0:2:12,0 --> 0:2:16,0
Submitted for your approval: one First National Bank.


36
0:2:16,0 --> 0:2:18,0
What is a bank, you ask?


37
0:2:18,0 --> 0:2:24,0
A curious place where both space, time and irony exist; and yet, don't.


38
0:2:24,0 --> 0:2:26,0
Are you gonna be doing that the whole time?


39
0:2:26,0 --> 0:2:28,0
Pay attention, Pile.


40
0:2:28,0 --> 0:2:33,0
Exhibit A: those who have come to deposit and safely store their crrent monies.


41
0:2:33,0 --> 0:2:37,0
Exhibit B: those who need to borrow said money for purposes unknown.


42
0:2:37,0 --> 0:2:40,0
Hey, that's me!


43
0:2:40,0 --> 0:2:47,32
Ergo, exhibit C: the bank only has so much money in the vault to lend out to people such as you.


44
0:2:47,32 --> 0:2:50,24
Hey! Hey! That's the guy. He took my house.


45
0:2:50,24 --> 0:2:54,36
Really screwing my vibe here, Pile. Space-time continuum - he can't hear you.


46
0:2:54,36 --> 0:2:58,0
Just let me narrate. Now, where was I?


47
0:2:58,0 --> 0:3:3,0
So you see: by the time he got to you, Pile, his bank was out of money.


48
0:3:3,0 --> 0:3:7,0
But he gave me lots of money and charged me a lot of interest.


49
0:3:7,0 --> 0:3:10,0
Yes, that's the only way banks make money,


50
0:3:10,0 --> 0:3:11,56
by making debt loans.


51
0:3:11,56 --> 0:3:13,0
Debt = money, Pile.


52
0:3:13,0 --> 0:3:16,0
Remember that, debt = money.


53
0:3:16,0 --> 0:3:19,0
The more loans they make, the more money they make.


54
0:3:19,0 --> 0:3:22,0
But if they don't have any money, where did my money come from?


55
0:3:22,0 --> 0:3:29,0
You're gonna wanna take a step back.


56
0:3:29,0 --> 0:3:30,0
Woah! No way!�


57
0:3:30,0 --> 0:3:31,0
Yes way,


58
0:3:31,0 --> 0:3:33,0
and that's nothing.


59
0:3:33,0 --> 0:3:38,0
Hey buddy, need some money?


60
0:3:38,0 --> 0:3:39,0
They didn't to that!


61
0:3:39,0 --> 0:3:42,0
Oh, they did exactly that, Pile!


62
0:3:42,0 --> 0:3:46,0
Remember, banks make money by making loans, by selling debt.


63
0:3:46,0 --> 0:3:52,0
Even to bad credit risks.


64
0:3:52,0 --> 0:3:54,0
Yo, have some money, dude.


65
0:3:54,0 --> 0:3:56,0
Just sign here.


66
0:3:56,0 --> 0:3:57,0
Oh, my gosh!


67
0:3:57,0 --> 0:3:59,0
Mmm, they call it free money.


68
0:3:59,0 --> 0:4:3,0
Yeah, that's exactly what my loan guy told me: free money.


69
0:4:3,0 --> 0:4:5,0
But it ain't free.


70
0:4:5,0 --> 0:4:8,0
The worst part was offering money to people who don't even need it.


71
0:4:8,0 --> 0:4:13,0
People, Pile, like you.


72
0:4:13,0 --> 0:4:24,0
You're right, I didn't need him. I was happy here.


73
0:4:24,0 --> 0:4:27,0
Why is he sad? He's making all that money.


74
0:4:27,0 --> 0:4:32,0
Shhh... He's thinking.


75
0:4:32,0 --> 0:4:36,0
Now wait for it... Now wait for it...


76
0:4:36,0 --> 0:4:38,0
BIngo!


77
0:4:38,0 --> 0:4:41,0
See, the bankers loan to everyone in town,


78
0:4:41,0 --> 0:4:44,0
but to make more money they have to lone even more.


79
0:4:44,0 --> 0:4:47,0
More? How much money do they need?


80
0:4:47,0 --> 0:4:49,0
More.


81
0:4:49,0 --> 0:4:50,0
What's that?!


82
0:4:50,0 --> 0:4:53,0
Behold, a black horse rideth!


83
0:4:53,0 --> 0:5:9,16
Credit cards!


84
0:5:9,16 --> 0:5:12,0
Refinance Your Home!


85
0:5:12,0 --> 0:5:15,0
Wow, look! It's gonna be okay.


86
0:5:15,0 --> 0:5:17,0
Everything's gonna be okay.


87
0:5:17,0 --> 0:5:18,0
What now?


88
0:5:18,0 --> 0:5:22,0
Now? Well, Pile, with all this money, we might as well...


89
0:5:22,0 --> 0:5:29,0
...partyyy!


90
0:5:29,0 --> 0:5:33,0
Oh ho, this is awesome. I needed to get my head clear.


91
0:5:33,0 --> 0:5:36,0
When I get back I'm gonna straighten all this out.


92
0:5:36,0 --> 0:5:43,0
I just hope Dream is doing okay.


93
0:5:43,0 --> 0:5:47,0
Ben Bernanke! I'm going to get you, my pretty!


94
0:5:47,0 --> 0:5:52,0
Yep, he is. I'm sure he is.


95
0:5:52,0 --> 0:5:55,48
Mmm... You put it on his tab. Little something for yourself.


96
0:5:55,48 --> 0:5:58,0
Wait.


97
0:5:58,0 --> 0:6:2,0
You know, wait a second Hartman. I just thought of something.


98
0:6:2,0 --> 0:6:6,8
If I got this money from the bank, and the bank got it from the Federal Reserve dump trucks...


99
0:6:6,8 --> 0:6:9,0
Go on...


100
0:6:9,0 --> 0:6:12,0
...then where does the Federal Reserve get their money?


101
0:6:12,0 --> 0:6:15,0
Real nice time, ladies, real nice.


102
0:6:15,0 --> 0:6:18,0
Excuse me while I borrow these.


103
0:6:18,0 --> 0:6:22,0
Say, Hartman, why am I wearing a burglar bikini top.


104
0:6:22,0 --> 0:6:27,0
Because no one is allowed inside the Fed. Not you, not me, no American citizen,


105
0:6:27,0 --> 0:6:30,0
no duly elected member of our Congress, not the Supreme Court.


106
0:6:30,0 --> 0:6:32,0
Not the Supreme Court?


107
0:6:32,0 --> 0:6:34,0
Not the Supreme Court.


108
0:6:34,0 --> 0:6:46,0
Not the Justice Dep., not the CIA, DIA, FBI, ATF, BTE, NBC. Not even G-O-D.


109
0:6:46,0 --> 0:6:49,0
How come the government isn't allowed inside its own building?


110
0:6:49,0 --> 0:6:53,0
Government? Pile, the Fed is a private bank, owned by private stockholders.


111
0:6:53,0 --> 0:6:58,4
Do not let the name "Federal" fool you. This place is about as federal as Federal Express.


112
0:6:58,4 --> 0:7:5,0
A private bank? But... private?


113
0:7:5,0 --> 0:7:10,0
Shhh. Best to keep your voice down, Pile.


114
0:7:10,0 --> 0:7:11,0
This is Ethan, Federal Reserve.


115
0:7:11,0 --> 0:7:13,0
Hey Eth. Bill here, First National.


116
0:7:13,0 --> 0:7:15,0
Hi Bill, how are you?


117
0:7:15,0 --> 0:7:18,0
Good, good. We're running a little low on money?


118
0:7:18,0 --> 0:7:19,0
No problem, how much do you need?


119
0:7:19,0 --> 0:7:21,0
Oh, how does 20 million sound?


120
0:7:21,0 --> 0:7:23,0
What?!


121
0:7:23,0 --> 0:7:25,0
Excellent, we will ship it over first thing tomorrow.


122
0:7:25,0 --> 0:7:30,0
Wait, he can just call up the Fed and ask for more money and they give them whatever they want?


123
0:7:30,0 --> 0:7:38,0
No, Pile, the Fed don't give the banks money; the Fed loans the banks money.


124
0:7:38,0 --> 0:7:41,0
The banks have to pay it back with interest. Come on, time to go.


125
0:7:41,0 --> 0:7:46,0
Wait, wait, wait! I still don't understand. Where does the Fed get their money...


126
0:7:46,0 --> 0:7:53,76
I mean, if they're are private bank? You said they're a private bank, right? OK, so who puts money into the Fed bank?


127
0:7:53,76 --> 0:7:56,0
This is Mel, United States Mint.


128
0:7:56,0 --> 0:7:59,0
Hi ya Mel. First National needs another twenty millis.


129
0:7:59,0 --> 0:8:2,0
We're already running the presses full steam here, Ethan.


130
0:8:2,0 --> 0:8:4,0
Gotta keep making loans, Gotta keep the money flowing.


131
0:8:4,0 --> 0:8:7,0
All right, you're the Fed. What ever you guys say.


132
0:8:7,0 --> 0:8:11,0
Twenty million more, by morning!


133
0:8:11,0 --> 0:8:16,0
But I don't get it. What's so wrong about the Fed printing money?


134
0:8:16,0 --> 0:8:18,0
Because it's unconstitutional, Pile.


135
0:8:18,0 --> 0:8:24,0
Our treasury is supposed to create our money, but now the Fed controls the printing of America's money.


136
0:8:24,0 --> 0:8:29,0
Nobody gets a friggin dollar that the Fed didn't print.


137
0:8:29,0 --> 0:8:30,0
So?


138
0:8:30,0 --> 0:8:36,0
They print the money, then they loan it to the government, then they charge the government interest, and then the government taxes you to pay for it.


139
0:8:36,0 --> 0:8:37,0
Wake up, Pile.


140
0:8:37,0 --> 0:8:40,0
I don't see what the big deal is.


141
0:8:40,0 --> 0:8:42,0
Mmm,.. You know, you're right, Pile.


142
0:8:42,0 --> 0:8:43,0
Wait a minute. Wait... I am?


143
0:8:43,0 --> 0:8:47,8
Yeah! I forget how effective they are at keeping you ignorant.


144
0:8:47,8 --> 0:8:50,0
Oh, that's okay. Hey, I'm not ignorant!


145
0:8:50,0 --> 0:8:53,0
Do you even know what money is, Pile?


146
0:8:53,0 --> 0:8:57,0
*10th Century.*


147
0:8:57,0 --> 0:9:6,32
In the long, long ago, people bartered. They traded things they had for things they wanted. I'll trade you my raspberries for that there pot pie.�


148
0:9:6,32 --> 0:9:8,0
I don't want your berries.


149
0:9:8,0 --> 0:9:11,0
Come on, Pile! They're sweet berries.


150
0:9:11,0 --> 0:9:13,0
They're not sweet, they're old. And I don't like berries.


151
0:9:13,0 --> 0:9:14,24
Give me that pot pie!!!


152
0:9:14,24 --> 0:9:15,0
No!


153
0:9:15,0 --> 0:9:19,0
As you can see, this bartering situation created some problems.


154
0:9:19,0 --> 0:9:22,0
Then one day, a goldsmith walked up and said:


155
0:9:22,0 --> 0:9:29,0
Now, everybody thinks gold is valuable so why doesn't everybody trade gold for things they need?


156
0:9:29,0 --> 0:9:34,0
Price was set for gold and now it was very easy to conduct commerce


157
0:9:34,0 --> 0:9:37,96
because people could trade gold for all the things they needed.


158
0:9:37,96 --> 0:9:42,0
Hartman! Wow, look at all my gold!


159
0:9:42,0 --> 0:9:45,0
Hey, hey, stop them! That's my gold!


160
0:9:45,0 --> 0:9:46,0
Damn thieves!


161
0:9:46,0 --> 0:9:51,0
Say there, Pile, I've got a vault and some guards. I can keep your gold safe for you


162
0:9:51,0 --> 0:9:53,0
for a small fee.


163
0:9:53,0 --> 0:9:55,0
Yeah, sure. That would be awesome.


164
0:9:55,0 --> 0:9:59,0
You see, Pile, this is how the first bank made money.


165
0:9:59,0 --> 0:10:2,72
There you go, Pile. I owe you 100 gold coins.


166
0:10:2,72 --> 0:10:4,0
Okay, great!


167
0:10:4,0 --> 0:10:10,0
Come back any time and redeem your gold when you want it. It'll be right here, in my vault.


168
0:10:10,0 --> 0:10:14,0
Now you're holding the very first paper money, Pile.


169
0:10:14,0 --> 0:10:18,0
Wow, this is great! It all makes sense.


170
0:10:18,0 --> 0:10:27,0
Oh, that's right, it was good. Everybody started using I.O.U.s because everybody knew the I.O.U. was as good as gold.


171
0:10:27,0 --> 0:10:33,0
Wow, this candy is really a good price: one I.O.U. Hmm, I'm getting some more for later.


172
0:10:33,0 --> 0:10:41,0
Hey, wait a minute. It was just one I.O.U. Ten I.O.U."s for chocolate? They can't just raise prices like that.


173
0:10:41,0 --> 0:10:47,0
Oh, the candy man can.


174
0:10:47,0 --> 0:10:50,0
Wait, that is just friggin wrong.


175
0:10:50,0 --> 0:10:56,0
It's called inflation, Pile. It makes your I.O.U.s worth less and less until they are worth nothing. Less bang for the buck.


176
0:10:56,0 --> 0:10:59,0
Dollar ain't what it used to be.


177
0:10:59,0 --> 0:11:5,0
But I worked hard and I baked all those pot pies. Now I have to work harder to make less?


178
0:11:5,0 --> 0:11:6,0
That's not fair!


179
0:11:6,0 --> 0:11:12,0
Oh, if you think that's not fair, you're gonna love the next part.


180
0:11:12,0 --> 0:11:13,0
Oh, what's he doing?


181
0:11:13,0 --> 0:11:15,0
How do banks make money, Pile?


182
0:11:15,0 --> 0:11:17,0
Ah, by making more loans?


183
0:11:17,0 --> 0:11:20,0
Oh that's right, he's good.


184
0:11:20,0 --> 0:11:23,0
You see, he prints more IOUs without any more gold,


185
0:11:23,0 --> 0:11:27,0
loans them out for interest, makes a pretty penny, and nobody is the wiser...


186
0:11:27,0 --> 0:11:30,0
unless everybody wanted their gold back at the same time.


187
0:11:30,0 --> 0:11:33,0
No, no, no. That's my gold.


188
0:11:33,0 --> 0:11:36,0
Not anymore.


189
0:11:36,0 --> 0:11:38,0
What are you talking about?


190
0:11:38,0 --> 0:11:41,0
I'd like to redeem my IOUs please.


191
0:11:41,0 --> 0:11:42,0
Thank you very much.


192
0:11:42,0 --> 0:11:46,0
Hey!


193
0:11:46,0 --> 0:11:49,0
I want my gold back now!


194
0:11:49,0 --> 0:11:50,0
Thief! Thief!


195
0:11:50,0 --> 0:11:53,0
I love the bank run. Bringing people together.


196
0:11:53,0 --> 0:12:1,0
See, they all found out he was stealing, made a run on the bank and demanded their gold. But as you can see, there ain't no gold to get.


197
0:12:1,0 --> 0:12:3,0
Hartman!


198
0:12:3,0 --> 0:12:7,0
Don't worry, Pile. Back in these times, vengeance will be yours.


199
0:12:7,0 --> 0:12:11,0
Three things in this world you don't do. Never mess with another man's woman.


200
0:12:11,0 --> 0:12:13,0
Never mess with another man's ego.


201
0:12:13,0 --> 0:12:21,0
And most importantly you never mess with another man's money.


202
0:12:21,0 --> 0:12:24,0
Else, the man will mess with you.


203
0:12:24,0 --> 0:12:27,0
My god, you hung him?


204
0:12:27,0 --> 0:12:30,0
Yes, Pile. Oh, we hung him. We hung him high!


205
0:12:30,0 --> 0:12:33,0
And do you know why?


206
0:12:33,0 --> 0:12:36,0
Because he was a thief?


207
0:12:36,0 --> 0:12:39,0
Because, Pile, an evil intention was born.


208
0:12:39,0 --> 0:12:44,0
Man discovered how to turn worthless paper into gold.


209
0:12:44,0 --> 0:12:55,0
Thus was invented the ultimate machine to steal real money and enslave all the nations on earth.


210
0:12:55,0 --> 0:12:57,0
It's alive!


211
0:12:57,0 --> 0:12:59,0
Oh now, come on, you're just being dramatic.


212
0:12:59,0 --> 0:13:1,0
I mean, I lost my house but...


213
0:13:1,0 --> 0:13:2,0
What is that? Explain.


214
0:13:2,0 --> 0:13:4,0
The nuclear power plant?


215
0:13:4,0 --> 0:13:10,0
Um, hmm. Produces lots of electricity and little pollution. An invention for the good of humanity.


216
0:13:10,0 --> 0:13:12,0
Okay, but what's this have to do with...


217
0:13:12,0 --> 0:13:17,0
3, 2...


218
0:13:17,0 --> 0:13:22,0
Atomic energy. A discovery more powerful than anything man had yet conceived.


219
0:13:22,0 --> 0:13:27,0
It can be used for good or evil.


220
0:13:27,0 --> 0:13:32,0
Now, unlike Einstein, the goldsmith's discovery has been kept a closely guarded secret.


221
0:13:32,0 --> 0:13:34,0
It was never intended for you to see.


222
0:13:34,0 --> 0:13:38,0
This discovery is called fractional reserved banking.


223
0:13:38,0 --> 0:13:42,0
In the wrong hands, it's more powerful than a nuclear bomb


224
0:13:42,0 --> 0:13:48,0
in its ability to completely and utterly destroy a nation who is subjected to its perversion.


225
0:13:48,0 --> 0:13:51,0
No. No, no, no, no.


226
0:13:51,0 --> 0:13:55,0
It is time we stop this evil secret and the men behind it...


227
0:13:55,0 --> 0:13:56,0
You're being ridiculous.


228
0:13:56,0 --> 0:13:59,0
...before America is destroyed forever.


229
0:13:59,0 --> 0:14:1,0
Believe it, Pile


230
0:14:1,0 --> 0:14:4,0
No, no, no, no. I just want my dog back.


231
0:14:4,0 --> 0:14:9,0
Dammit! That's it, I give up. Let them live in chains.


232
0:14:9,0 --> 0:14:11,0
No, Hartman.


233
0:14:11,0 --> 0:14:17,0
The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.


234
0:14:17,0 --> 0:14:19,0
Thomas Jefferson?


235
0:14:19,0 --> 0:14:22,0
Mr. President, how do I get him to understand?


236
0:14:22,0 --> 0:14:26,0
As we did, son. Remain vigilant.


237
0:14:26,0 --> 0:14:32,0
To many have hidden the truth and the light of our liberty dims with every passing day.


238
0:14:32,0 --> 0:14:36,0
Quickly, take my horse. Show him.


239
0:14:36,0 --> 0:14:38,0
Wait. Show me what? Where are we going?


240
0:14:38,0 --> 0:14:41,36
Away, stallion of liberty.


241
0:14:41,36 --> 0:14:45,0
Ride hard the holy wind.


242
0:14:45,0 --> 0:14:47,0
Oh, where are we?


243
0:14:47,0 --> 0:14:48,0
The Battle of Waterloo.


244
0:14:48,0 --> 0:14:52,0
Hold on. We gotta get through.


245
0:14:52,0 --> 0:14:54,0
The money machine. There it is!


246
0:14:54,0 --> 0:14:56,0
Hey, is that the same people?


247
0:14:56,0 --> 0:15:0,0
Rich banker men from Germany flying under the banner of the Red Shield. (Rothschild)


248
0:15:0,0 --> 0:15:2,0
They financed both sides of the war.


249
0:15:2,0 --> 0:15:5,0
We must hurry.


250
0:15:5,0 --> 0:15:7,0
That's him, the Red Shield courier. Shoot him!


251
0:15:7,0 --> 0:15:10,0
No. I'm not shooting any one.


252
0:15:10,0 --> 0:15:11,0
Dammit, Pile.


253
0:15:11,0 --> 0:15:12,0
What?


254
0:15:12,0 --> 0:15:16,0
He beat everyone back with the news of the war and told England that Napoleon won.


255
0:15:16,0 --> 0:15:19,0
London Stock Exchange


256
0:15:19,0 --> 0:15:23,0
The Red Shield bankers of London pretended that England was doomed and started selling their English stocks.


257
0:15:23,0 --> 0:15:26,0
The English went into a selling frenzy to get rid of worthless English money.


258
0:15:26,0 --> 0:15:29,0
But, the English won, right?


259
0:15:29,0 --> 0:15:32,0
Of course they won. But it was a trick by Red Shield.


260
0:15:32,0 --> 0:15:38,0
They waited until the stocks plummeted to pennies and then bought England back back for nearly nothing.


261
0:15:38,0 --> 0:15:41,0
What? They did that? How?


262
0:15:41,0 --> 0:15:46,0
When the English leaders found out, they had no choice but to give themselves over to the Red Shield.


263
0:15:46,0 --> 0:15:50,0
Their money was gone and they were slaves to the Red Shield war debt.


264
0:15:50,0 --> 0:15:56,0
Since that time the English have been paying their national taxes directly to the Red Shield private bankers.


265
0:15:56,0 --> 0:15:59,0
The people have no idea.


266
0:15:59,0 --> 0:16:1,0
But the bankers bragged about what they did to us.


267
0:16:1,0 --> 0:16:4,0
Laughing at us all the way to the bank.


268
0:16:4,0 --> 0:16:7,0
*Buckingham Palace. Nathan Rothschild* Why it's the best business I've ever done.


269
0:16:7,0 --> 0:16:13,0
"If I can control a nation's wealth, I care not who makes its laws." (quote M.A. Rothschild)


270
0:16:13,0 --> 0:16:17,0
Oh, is this what Jefferson wanted to show me?


271
0:16:17,0 --> 0:16:21,0
No, Pile. Look.


272
0:16:21,0 --> 0:16:23,0
They're in America too?


273
0:16:23,0 --> 0:16:26,0
The Red Shield banks are here, Pile,


274
0:16:26,0 --> 0:16:28,0
seeking a way to conquer our American Dream.


275
0:16:28,0 --> 0:16:30,0
The dream you had, Pile.


276
0:16:30,0 --> 0:16:33,0
A dream... of free men.


277
0:16:33,0 --> 0:16:36,0
They tried to take over our country many times and failed


278
0:16:36,0 --> 0:16:44,0
because Jefferson and the patriots vowed to stop the evil tyrants at all costs.


279
0:16:44,0 --> 0:16:49,0
By authority of eternal God he would not let the bankers win here.


280
0:16:49,0 --> 0:16:55,0
"To preserve our independence we must not let our rulers load us with perpetual debt.


281
0:16:55,0 --> 0:16:58,0
We must make our choice between economy and liberty


282
0:16:58,0 --> 0:17:0,12
or profusion and servitude.


283
0:17:0,12 --> 0:17:1,0
(quote Thomase Jefferson)


284
0:17:1,0 --> 0:17:6,0
I place economy among the most important and republican virtues,


285
0:17:6,0 --> 0:17:10,0
and public debt is the greatest of the dangers to be feared.


286
0:17:10,0 --> 0:17:15,0
It is incumbent on every generation to pay its own debts as it goes."


287
0:17:15,0 --> 0:17:19,2
We must have a central bank to secure this country's finances!


288
0:17:19,2 --> 0:17:25,0
"If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their money,


289
0:17:25,0 --> 0:17:32,0
first by inflation and then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them


290
0:17:32,0 --> 0:17:37,0
will deprive the people of their property until their children will wake up homeless


291
0:17:37,0 --> 0:17:40,0
on the very continent their fathers conquered!"


292
0:17:40,0 --> 0:17:45,0
Jefferson, you're mad! This country will have a central bank.


293
0:17:45,0 --> 0:17:46,0
Who's that?


294
0:17:46,0 --> 0:17:49,0
America's first Secretary Of Treasury.


295
0:17:49,0 --> 0:17:51,0
Alexander Hamilton?


296
0:17:51,0 --> 0:17:52,0
Not for long.


297
0:17:52,0 --> 0:17:55,0
Aaron Burr, Thomas Jefferson's Vice President.


298
0:17:55,0 --> 0:18:0,0
They didn't take too kindly to our first Sec Treasury.


299
0:18:0,0 --> 0:18:3,0
Sweet shot, Burr.


300
0:18:3,0 --> 0:18:7,0
The first attempt at a central bank only lasted 20 years and we shut it down.


301
0:18:7,0 --> 0:18:12,0
But the bankers tried again against Old Hickory, Andrew Jackson.


302
0:18:12,0 --> 0:18:15,0
You are a den of vipers and thieves.


303
0:18:15,0 --> 0:18:22,0
I intend to route you out and by the eternal God I will route you out.


304
0:18:22,0 --> 0:18:28,0
After surviving an assassination attempt, Jackson finally defeated the bank in 1836.


305
0:18:28,0 --> 0:18:32,0
When asked what was the greatest accomplishment in his life, Old Hickory replied,


306
0:18:32,0 --> 0:18:36,0
I killed the bank.


307
0:18:36,0 --> 0:18:43,0
And those were his last words: "I killed the bank."


308
0:18:43,0 --> 0:18:45,0
And, with reel money backed with real gold,


309
0:18:45,0 --> 0:18:49,0
our country experienced the greatest boom in any nation's history.


310
0:18:49,0 --> 0:18:52,0
Oh, it was beautiful, Pile.


311
0:18:52,0 --> 0:18:57,0
But the bankers, greedy for more power and wealth, were concocting their most ambitious plan yet:


312
0:18:57,0 --> 0:19:2,0
to once and for all take control of the finances of the United States.


313
0:19:2,0 --> 0:19:6,0
In 1910, a secret meeting was held in the J.P. Morgan estate


314
0:19:6,0 --> 0:19:9,0
on Jekyll Island of the coast of Georgia.


315
0:19:9,0 --> 0:19:13,0
This meeting was so secret, so concealed from government and public knowledge,


316
0:19:13,0 --> 0:19:20,0
that the 10 attendees used code names.


317
0:19:20,0 --> 0:19:22,0
I am clearly the richest man,


318
0:19:22,0 --> 0:19:26,0
so I should be the one to run the super secret central bank.


319
0:19:26,0 --> 0:19:30,0
I own all the oil in America. I'm clearly richer than you will ever be Hula Girl.


320
0:19:30,0 --> 0:19:33,0
I should run the super secret central bank.


321
0:19:33,0 --> 0:19:38,0
You're nothing compared to me, Lube Job. I shall run the secret bank.


322
0:19:38,0 --> 0:19:41,0
Silence!


323
0:19:41,0 --> 0:19:44,0
Supreme master leader, I didn't know you were gonna be here.


324
0:19:44,0 --> 0:19:48,0
I'm not. Neither are you, dumb ass.


325
0:19:48,0 --> 0:19:50,0
Oh yeah, right, right.


326
0:19:50,0 --> 0:19:52,0
He's so smart!


327
0:19:52,0 --> 0:19:55,0
None of you shall run the bank.


328
0:19:55,0 --> 0:19:58,0
We have failed in the past because of openness.


329
0:19:58,0 --> 0:20:1,0
This time the key to success is secrecy.


330
0:20:1,0 --> 0:20:5,0
The people must believe that they run the bank.


331
0:20:5,0 --> 0:20:10,0
Yes, brilliant! A sneak attack. What's the plan?


332
0:20:10,0 --> 0:20:14,0
We first create panic, then we show them the solution.


333
0:20:14,0 --> 0:20:17,0
With our man in office and well-planned timing


334
0:20:17,0 --> 0:20:19,0
we will have our central bank.


335
0:20:19,0 --> 0:20:23,0
And so the people think it is theirs. We shall christen it Federal!


336
0:20:23,0 --> 0:20:31,0
the Federal Reserve!


337
0:20:31,0 --> 0:20:35,0
They struck on December 23rd, 1913


338
0:20:35,0 --> 0:20:38,0
when most of our congress were home eating fruit cake


339
0:20:38,0 --> 0:20:41,0
These bastards, I mean bankers,


340
0:20:41,0 --> 0:20:45,0
presented their treasonous act to their newly elected accomplice Woodrow Wilson...


341
0:20:45,0 --> 0:20:50,0
...who had fortuitously already agreed to sign it before he was even elected.


342
0:20:50,0 --> 0:20:53,0
Wait. The IRS?


343
0:20:53,0 --> 0:20:55,0
I thought we always had the IRS.


344
0:20:55,0 --> 0:20:59,0
No, Pile. They did this to us too.


345
0:20:59,0 --> 0:21:5,0
The Fed now has the exclusive power to print America's money.


346
0:21:5,0 --> 0:21:8,0
They loan this money to our banks and our government at interest,


347
0:21:8,0 --> 0:21:13,0
putting immediate debt on our own money,


348
0:21:13,0 --> 0:21:22,0
printing more and more so each dollar they print becomes worth less than the one before.


349
0:21:22,0 --> 0:21:27,0
Merry... Christmas.


350
0:21:27,0 --> 0:21:30,0
What in the hell is that?


351
0:21:30,0 --> 0:21:35,0
That, Pile, is how our government must now pay back these debts to the Fed.


352
0:21:35,0 --> 0:21:38,0
Your taxes do not go to your government.


353
0:21:38,0 --> 0:21:39,0
They don't?


354
0:21:39,0 --> 0:21:42,0
Hmm. It's the greatest theft in human history.


355
0:21:42,0 --> 0:21:46,0
Okay. I mean, I sorta get what you're saying,


356
0:21:46,0 --> 0:21:48,0
but it's also confusing and really Hartman,


357
0:21:48,0 --> 0:21:50,0
I don't see how it affects me at all.


358
0:21:50,0 --> 0:21:53,0
If I had more money, none of this would have happened!


359
0:21:53,0 --> 0:21:59,0
Hartman?


360
0:21:59,0 --> 0:22:2,0
1955. Wow, what are we doing here?


361
0:22:2,0 --> 0:22:4,0
Oh, a little bit of shopping.


362
0:22:4,0 --> 0:22:7,0
Here, hold this. Gallon of gas: 23 cents.


363
0:22:7,0 --> 0:22:12,0
Postage stamp: 3 cents. Ounce of gold: 35 $.


364
0:22:12,0 --> 0:22:15,4
Hot baby: priceless.


365
0:22:15,4 --> 0:22:17,0
Best be getting back.


366
0:22:17,0 --> 0:22:19,6
Hey Hartman, I need my car, man!


367
0:22:19,6 --> 0:22:22,68
Oh, was that Michael J...


368
0:22:22,68 --> 0:22:26,0
Yeah, he'll be fine.


369
0:22:26,0 --> 0:22:31,44
Now, Pile, would you agree that you have the same exact things that you had in 1955?


370
0:22:31,44 --> 0:22:38,0
Yeah. One stamp, one gallon of gas, one ounce of gold and one home.


371
0:22:38,0 --> 0:22:42,0
Well, we just made a lot of money.


372
0:22:42,0 --> 0:22:44,0
Hey!


373
0:22:44,0 --> 0:22:49,0
Gotta pay your taxes. Bet it's nice to have made all that money.


374
0:22:49,0 --> 0:22:53,0
Wait, that isn't fair! Now I actually have less money.


375
0:22:53,0 --> 0:22:55,0
I can't even go buy the things I just sold.


376
0:22:55,0 --> 0:22:59,0
The IRS and the Fed's inflation work together, Pile.


377
0:22:59,0 --> 0:23:3,0
They aren't just taxing gain, they are taxing their inflation.


378
0:23:3,0 --> 0:23:6,0
You are no richer than you were in 1955.


379
0:23:6,0 --> 0:23:9,0
Now, does that sound fair or American to you?


380
0:23:9,0 --> 0:23:13,0
Yeah, but I mean, who doesn't hate taxes? I hate the IRS anyway.


381
0:23:13,0 --> 0:23:18,0
Pile, the higher they make the inflation, the more of your they take.


382
0:23:18,0 --> 0:23:20,0
It's thievery.


383
0:23:20,0 --> 0:23:27,0
You're not paying taxes on any more, you are paying taxes on the same and now you have less!


384
0:23:27,0 --> 0:23:30,0
They take our property right in front of our eyes


385
0:23:30,0 --> 0:23:34,0
just like Thomas Jefferson said they would.


386
0:23:34,0 --> 0:23:36,0
What's that?


387
0:23:36,0 --> 0:23:38,0
They found us!


388
0:23:38,0 --> 0:23:40,0
Quick, my sword!


389
0:23:40,0 --> 0:23:42,0
What sword?


390
0:23:42,0 --> 0:23:48,0
We don't need your banking machine! I condemn you to die, dammit! Die!


391
0:23:48,0 --> 0:24:1,0
Pile, Bernanke bogie on my nine. Take him at his knees.


392
0:24:1,0 --> 0:24:6,0
"For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy


393
0:24:6,0 --> 0:24:12,0
that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence."


394
0:24:12,0 --> 0:24:15,0
What's happening? Where are we?


395
0:24:15,0 --> 0:24:19,0
I believe perhaps you understand now, Pile. But you are afraid.


396
0:24:19,0 --> 0:24:24,0
JFK. Hartman, what does this have to do with my house and my dog?


397
0:24:24,0 --> 0:24:26,0
Okay, that's enough. I want to go home now.


398
0:24:26,0 --> 0:24:30,0
This is the last president to stand up to the Fed.


399
0:24:30,0 --> 0:24:32,0
You must see...


400
0:24:32,0 --> 0:24:39,0
On June 4, 1963, President Kennedy signed Executive Order 11110.


401
0:24:39,0 --> 0:24:44,0
This executive order empowered the U.S. Treasury to issue real money without the Fed.


402
0:24:44,0 --> 0:24:46,48
It would have worked.


403
0:24:46,48 --> 0:24:51,0
Kennedy's plan to dismantle the Federal Reserve machine had begun.


404
0:24:51,0 --> 0:24:56,0
Six months later, John F. Kennedy went to Dallas and never returned.


405
0:24:56,0 --> 0:25:0,0
No way. No way they could do that.


406
0:25:0,0 --> 0:25:3,0
The new president, Lyndon Johnson, threw out Kennedy's order.


407
0:25:3,0 --> 0:25:10,0
And since JFK, no president has dared confront the secret powers behind the Federal Reserve.


408
0:25:10,0 --> 0:25:16,0
They consolidate bigger and bigger banks, print more and more money, accountable to no one,


409
0:25:16,0 --> 0:25:21,0
decimating our nation's wealth for the benefit of a few.


410
0:25:21,0 --> 0:25:25,0
Why? Why do this? If they hurt us it hurts the global bankers too.


411
0:25:25,0 --> 0:25:33,0
No, Pile, they are protected. They are too big to fail.


412
0:25:33,0 --> 0:25:37,0
But I'm not. Those sons of bitches!


413
0:25:37,0 --> 0:25:47,0
Mmm, sons of bitches all.


414
0:25:47,0 --> 0:25:51,0
The day was cold,


415
0:25:51,0 --> 0:25:55,0
the wind sharp and strong,


416
0:25:55,0 --> 0:25:57,0
but we were determined!


417
0:25:57,0 --> 0:26:1,0
The bankers and their parasites had us vastly outnumbered


418
0:26:1,0 --> 0:26:5,0
but their hubris made them weak.


419
0:26:5,0 --> 0:26:7,0
Not like us.


420
0:26:7,0 --> 0:26:10,0
not like this band of immortals we have assembled.


421
0:26:10,0 --> 0:26:14,0
We have come to take back our...


422
0:26:14,0 --> 0:26:17,0
Hartman, is that...?


423
0:26:17,0 --> 0:26:19,0
My dog!


424
0:26:19,0 --> 0:26:23,0
Oh, sh...


425
0:26:23,0 --> 0:26:29,0
Then the inevitable. The money kings could ignore us no longer.


426
0:26:29,0 --> 0:26:36,0
They sent an emissary, a cog in the machine of greed, to bring about our submission,


427
0:26:36,0 --> 0:26:38,0
Hank Paulson.


428
0:26:38,0 --> 0:26:43,0
Hartman, this is blasphemy. We own the corners of the earth.


429
0:26:43,0 --> 0:26:45,0
It is futile to challenge us.


430
0:26:45,0 --> 0:26:49,0
Oh, I've seen that look before,


431
0:26:49,0 --> 0:26:52,0
that of a predator taking in the scent of its prey:


432
0:26:52,0 --> 0:26:58,0
bold, fearless, the look of a free man.


433
0:26:58,0 --> 0:27:4,0
You have come far, Hartman, father than most. Be smart now; join us!


434
0:27:4,0 --> 0:27:8,0
We will bring you money, power, everything you want!


435
0:27:8,0 --> 0:27:59,0
You can be one of us if you will kneel.


436
0:27:59,0 --> 0:28:3,0
Madman! You're a madman!�


437
0:28:3,0 --> 0:28:12,0
We are offering you everything! What do you think this is?!


438
0:28:12,0 --> 0:28:31,0
THIS IS AMERICA!
