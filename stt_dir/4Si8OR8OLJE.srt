Today we're hanging
with Oscar nominees.

0:0:13,566 --> 0:0:15,72
For the past three years,
the Egyptian revolution


10
0:0:15,72 --> 0:0:17,19
has been a roller coaster.


11
0:0:17,19 --> 0:0:19,1
Two presidents
have been deposed.


12
0:0:19,1 --> 0:0:20,35
Thousands of people have died.


13
0:0:20,35 --> 0:0:22,439
And just yesterday, the
Prime Minister abruptly


14
0:0:22,439 --> 0:0:23,98
resigned his
government. "The Square"


15
0:0:23,98 --> 0:0:26,563
is a newly released documentary
that gives a street-level look


16
0:0:26,563 --> 0:0:38,649
at the ongoing
revolution since 2011.


17

JACOB SOBOROFF: It's up
for an Oscar this Sunday,


18
0:0:40,69 --> 0:0:42,77
and we got the filmmaker
Jehane and the producer Karim


19
0:0:42,77 --> 0:0:43,17
right here.


20
0:0:43,17 --> 0:0:43,48
Hey, guys.

JEHANE NOUJAIM: Hey, what's up?


22
0:0:44,5 --> 0:0:45,2
KARIM AMER: How
you doing, YouTube?


23
0:0:45,2 --> 0:0:46,47
JACOB SOBOROFF: Guys, tell
us about the challenges


24
0:0:46,47 --> 0:0:47,43
of making a film like this.


25
0:0:47,43 --> 0:0:49,888
JEHANE NOUJAIM: All of us got
either arrested, tear gassed,


26
0:0:49,888 --> 0:0:52,2
shot at at various points
in the making of the film.


27
0:0:52,2 --> 0:0:54,33
JACOB SOBOROFF: So these guys
just put the movie on YouTube


28
0:0:54,33 --> 0:0:55,16
for the people in Egypt.


29
0:0:55,16 --> 0:0:56,85
What motivated that, and
how does it work, exactly?


30
0:0:56,85 --> 0:0:58,13
KARIM AMER: YouTube
was an integral part


31
0:0:58,13 --> 0:0:58,96
of this revolution.


32
0:0:58,96 --> 0:1:1,68
When you live in a country where
the media is in full control


33
0:1:1,68 --> 0:1:4,129
and is lying about what's
happening on the ground,


34
0:1:4,129 --> 0:1:6,93
our young activists used
YouTube as their own channel


35
0:1:6,93 --> 0:1:7,93
to spread their stories.


36

37

Oscar this year.

Where can people see this movie?


39

Well, you can see it

0:1:14,46 --> 0:1:16,59
on Netflix in 47 countries,
including the US.

I want to tell you

about a new series I made
called "Man vs Waiter."


82
0:2:49,53 --> 0:2:50,72
The man is on a date.


83
0:2:50,72 --> 0:2:53,31
The waiter is a part of
that date by default.


84
0:2:53,31 --> 0:2:56,52

with something to drink?


85

water's fine for me.

to buy an alcoholic beverage,


90

out every week, probably
