saying, North Korea.

to North Korea?


7
0:1:3,39 --> 0:1:3,76
Why?


8
0:1:3,76 --> 0:1:6,3
Because nobody knows anything
about North Korea.


9
0:1:6,3 --> 0:1:7,7
So we were fascinated by it.


10
0:1:7,7 --> 0:1:10,57
And we tried to get in for a
year and a half, but couldn't


11
0:1:10,57 --> 0:1:13,1

let anyone in.

went 70 meters down.

Right here, it's kind of
like a theme park.

But as you see, just beyond the
theme park, hidden by the


58
0:3:18,63 --> 0:3:21,86

land mines and checkpoints


59
0:3:21,86 --> 0:3:23,27

A lot of families come, and
they put up messages or


62

North that they've been

0:11:30,63 --> 0:11:33,22



207
0:11:33,22 --> 0:11:34,47
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: Kumgangsan


208
0:11:34,47 --> 0:11:39,681



209
0:11:39,681 --> 0:11:41,3
SHANE SMITH: We're in the
big banquet room.


210
0:11:41,3 --> 0:11:43,6
As you can see, it's huge.


211
0:11:43,6 --> 0:11:46,77
There's about 20 women who are
getting ready for our dinner.


212
0:11:46,77 --> 0:11:49,41
First of all, they give you
about three or four courses of


213
0:11:49,41 --> 0:11:51,21
absolutely inedible food.


214
0:11:51,21 --> 0:11:52,24
It's just matter.


215
0:11:52,24 --> 0:11:54,91
It's like fried matter.


216
0:11:54,91 --> 0:11:57,3
And you're going, yeah, yeah.


217
0:11:57,3 --> 0:11:58,86
But you're waiting for
everyone to fill in.


218
0:11:58,86 --> 0:11:59,99
When's this banquet happening?


219
0:11:59,99 --> 0:12:0,82
When's the banquet?


220
0:12:0,82 --> 0:12:2,69
There is no banquet.


221
0:12:2,69 --> 0:12:5,47
Where is everyone?


222
0:12:5,47 --> 0:12:7,18
It's not very busy here.


223
0:12:7,18 --> 0:12:10,7
They realize they've gotten so
much bad press for not having


224
0:12:10,7 --> 0:12:12,92
food that they want to show,
oh there's plenty of food.


225
0:12:12,92 --> 0:12:14,6
Food everywhere.


226
0:12:14,6 --> 0:12:16,18
And they're carefully laying
out the food the whole time


227
0:12:16,18 --> 0:12:16,8
you're eating.


228
0:12:16,8 --> 0:12:19,78
And then as you leave, you
notice they're pulling all the


229
0:12:19,78 --> 0:12:23,18
things they've just carefully
laid into little tiny trays


230
0:12:23,18 --> 0:12:25,37
that are carefully going
to bring back to keep


231
0:12:25,37 --> 0:12:27,35
for the next day.


232
0:12:27,35 --> 0:12:29,86
And you're just sitting there by
yourself eating your matter


233
0:12:29,86 --> 0:12:32,53
going, OK I've come
to crazy land.


234
0:12:32,53 --> 0:12:40,927



235
0:12:40,927 --> 0:13:26,81



236
0:13:26,81 --> 0:13:28,93
SHANE SMITH: It's really gray
and heavy duty outside.


237
0:13:28,93 --> 0:13:34,62
I'm going to go downstairs to
meet our guards in 15 minutes.


238
0:13:34,62 --> 0:13:38,285
It's maybe the weirdest I've
ever felt in my life.


239
0:13:38,285 --> 0:13:41,53



240
0:13:41,53 --> 0:13:44,33
The first thing you realize
in North Korea is


241
0:13:44,33 --> 0:13:45,76
you're not a tourist.


242
0:13:45,76 --> 0:13:46,58
You're on a tour.


243
0:13:46,58 --> 0:13:47,58
You come in.


244
0:13:47,58 --> 0:13:49,3
You're shown what
you're shown.


245
0:13:49,3 --> 0:13:50,31
You're escorted out.


246
0:13:50,31 --> 0:13:51,41
You're escorted the
whole time.


247
0:13:51,41 --> 0:13:53,21
You're never allowed
on your own.


248
0:13:53,21 --> 0:13:56,5
You can't leave the hotel, which
is on an island, until


249
0:13:56,5 --> 0:13:57,23
your guards come and get you.


250
0:13:57,23 --> 0:13:59,58
You have a guard, a guide,
and secret police.


251
0:13:59,58 --> 0:14:5,3



252
0:14:5,3 --> 0:14:8,2
The first place they take you is
to the Pueblo, which is an


253
0:14:8,2 --> 0:14:11,88
American spy ship that they
captured in the '60s during


254
0:14:11,88 --> 0:14:12,71
the Cold War.


255
0:14:12,71 --> 0:14:15,1
And they docked it in
downtown Pyongyang.


256
0:14:15,1 --> 0:14:17,75
And the indoctrination starts.


257
0:14:17,75 --> 0:14:32,438



258
0:14:32,438 --> 0:14:35,58
SHANE SMITH: They force you to
sit there and watch this


259
0:14:35,58 --> 0:14:38,61
indoctrination video about how
the American imperialists are


260
0:14:38,61 --> 0:14:41,12
terrible, and they're shitting
on the peace-loving people of


261
0:14:41,12 --> 0:14:41,655
North Korea.


262
0:14:41,655 --> 0:14:43,12
And look how terrible
America is.


263
0:14:43,12 --> 0:14:44,66
Look how terrible Japan is.


264
0:14:44,66 --> 0:14:47,3
And how we got their ship, and
it shows that they were spying


265
0:14:47,3 --> 0:14:48,82
on us and how evil they are.


266
0:14:48,82 --> 0:14:50,67
Really incredibly
anti-American.


267
0:14:50,67 --> 0:15:40,92



268
0:15:40,92 --> 0:16:14,213



269
0:16:14,213 --> 0:16:16,209
SHANE SMITH: This
is very freaky.


270
0:16:16,209 --> 0:16:30,181



271
0:16:30,181 --> 0:16:33,3
On the way here, there's a big
poster that says the way to


272
0:16:33,3 --> 0:16:35,57
peace is a point of a bayonet.


273
0:16:35,57 --> 0:16:38,6
And all the North Koreans
are brought here.


274
0:16:38,6 --> 0:16:41,25
So you're sitting there as the
only Caucasian going, oh good,


275
0:16:41,25 --> 0:16:43,18
as everyone's staring
at you with daggers.


276
0:16:43,18 --> 0:16:44,48
And you're just sitting
there going, OK.


277
0:16:44,48 --> 0:16:46,9
Great, I get it.


278
0:16:46,9 --> 0:16:47,45
There's going to be a
lot more of this.


279
0:16:47,45 --> 0:16:55,57



280
0:16:55,57 --> 0:17:15,48



281
0:17:15,48 --> 0:17:50,87



282
0:17:50,87 --> 0:17:52,315
SHANE SMITH: So every day around
6:30 in the morning,


283
0:17:52,315 --> 0:17:55,4
our guides and our guards would
come to pick us up.


284
0:17:55,4 --> 0:17:59,55
They'd put us in a truck, drive
us out to some monument,


285
0:17:59,55 --> 0:18:0,83
and you'd drive for two hours.


286
0:18:0,83 --> 0:18:3,23
And the first thing you notice
are, there's no cars.


287
0:18:3,23 --> 0:18:5,135
The villages have
no electricity.


288
0:18:5,135 --> 0:18:5,58
There's no nothing.


289
0:18:5,58 --> 0:18:7,7
Nothing's happening anywhere.


290
0:18:7,7 --> 0:18:15,908



291
0:18:15,908 --> 0:18:19,42
We're going down south
of Pyongyang.


292
0:18:19,42 --> 0:18:22,29
As you can see, there's nobody
on the roads at all.


293
0:18:22,29 --> 0:18:24,15
There's no cars on the roads.


294
0:18:24,15 --> 0:18:26,63
We're at a tea shop right now.


295
0:18:26,63 --> 0:18:33,34
And as you can see, I'm
the only guy here.


296
0:18:33,34 --> 0:18:36,305
We're just driving on lonely
roads and going


297
0:18:36,305 --> 0:18:38,9
to lonely tea shops.


298
0:18:38,9 --> 0:18:42,1
And there'd be the tea girl
who speaks English and has


299
0:18:42,1 --> 0:18:43,155
been waiting for you.


300
0:18:43,155 --> 0:18:45,55
And you realize, she's been
waiting about six months for


301
0:18:45,55 --> 0:18:47,16
anyone to show up
to sell her tea.


302
0:18:47,16 --> 0:18:48,949
How are you?


303
0:18:48,949 --> 0:18:51,414
SHANE SMITH: Tea?


304
0:18:51,414 --> 0:18:52,893
SHANE SMITH: Sorry?


305
0:18:52,893 --> 0:18:53,632
SHANE SMITH: Coffee?


306
0:18:53,632 --> 0:18:54,865
No.


307
0:18:54,865 --> 0:18:57,823
This is tea?


308
0:18:57,823 --> 0:18:59,795
What is this?


309
0:18:59,795 --> 0:19:0,288
Tea?


310
0:19:0,288 --> 0:19:2,753
What is this here?


311
0:19:2,753 --> 0:19:4,3
Hello.


312
0:19:4,3 --> 0:19:7,19



313
0:19:7,19 --> 0:19:8,18
OK.


314
0:19:8,18 --> 0:19:10,19
And she's just so excited
you're there.


315
0:19:10,19 --> 0:19:12,76
And you realize, she hasn't
seen anyone in 10 months.


316
0:19:12,76 --> 0:19:14,48
And there's going to be another
10 months before


317
0:19:14,48 --> 0:19:16,378
anyone comes.


318
0:19:16,378 --> 0:19:17,86
You want to dance?


319
0:19:17,86 --> 0:19:28,728



320
0:19:28,728 --> 0:19:29,978
PUN-YUN-CHI: Oh.


321
0:19:29,978 --> 0:19:38,5



322
0:19:38,5 --> 0:19:40,22
SHANE SMITH: Shane.


323
0:19:40,22 --> 0:19:40,986
SHANE SMITH: Shane.


324
0:19:40,986 --> 0:19:41,95
PUN-YUN-CHI: Shane.


325
0:19:41,95 --> 0:19:43,878
SHANE SMITH: You?


326
0:19:43,878 --> 0:19:45,806
SHANE SMITH: Pun-Yun-Chi


327
0:19:45,806 --> 0:19:46,64
PUN-YUN-CHI: Yes.


328
0:19:46,64 --> 0:19:47,89
SHANE SMITH: Pun-Yun-Chi.


329
0:19:47,89 --> 0:19:56,996



330
0:19:56,996 --> 0:19:57,49
Oh.


331
0:19:57,49 --> 0:19:58,478
PUN-YUN-CHI: Oh.


332
0:19:58,478 --> 0:20:1,936
SHANE SMITH: Very good.


333
0:20:1,936 --> 0:20:4,9
PUN-YUN-CHI: Oh no.


334
0:20:4,9 --> 0:20:5,888
Oh.


335
0:20:5,888 --> 0:20:8,358
SHANE SMITH: I can't
get that one.


336
0:20:8,358 --> 0:20:20,214



337
0:20:20,214 --> 0:20:22,684
Oh!


338
0:20:22,684 --> 0:20:24,66
I like you.


339
0:20:24,66 --> 0:20:24,8
Thank you.


340
0:20:24,8 --> 0:20:28,2
CAMERAMAN: Thank you.


341
0:20:28,2 --> 0:20:30,7
SHANE SMITH: This
our tea room.


342
0:20:30,7 --> 0:20:30,63
We gotta go.


343
0:20:30,63 --> 0:20:32,218
We're late.


344
0:20:32,218 --> 0:20:34,21
We had a good time.


345
0:20:34,21 --> 0:20:36,22
It's so surreal.


346
0:20:36,22 --> 0:20:39,79
There's nothing normal
that happens ever


347
0:20:39,79 --> 0:20:41,1
in this whole country.


348
0:20:41,1 --> 0:22:41,1
