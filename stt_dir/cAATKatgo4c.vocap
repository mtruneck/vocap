###17 RICHARD FREEMAN: We're here on the banks of the River Lea,
###19 where something has been attacking and killing full
###23 grown Canada geese, which are big, powerful birds.
###25 It's interesting that at the time of the Olympics, we have
###30 an Olympic monster in the river.
###32 Richard.
###32 MIKE WELLS: Hello, Richard, Mike Wells.
###33 Hi.
###34 RICHARD FREEMAN: Nice to meet you.
###34 MIKE WELLS: Thanks for coming to discuss the great Olympic
###37 monster of the River Lea.
###39 RICHARD FREEMAN: Yes, well, fascinating.
###40 So what was it you saw, and when?
###43 MIKE WELLS: We were sat on the back deck of my boat, and
###46 there were a group of Canada geese.
###48 And there was one goose a little bit
###49 separated from the group.
###51 Suddenly, this goose went vertically
###55 down into the water.
###56 Me and Steve kind of looked at each other in amazement, and
###60 we were kind of looking to see if it reappeared.
###63 RICHARD FREEMAN: There have been a number of theories
###64 about what the creature in the River Lea is, some of them
###67 more fanciful than others.
###68 Some people have suggested crocodiles and alligators.
###71 These are tropical reptiles.
###73 And they are formidable beasts, they can kill full
###76 grown tigers, but they're not going to be found in the
###78 middle of London.
###79 It's far too cold.
###81 Same with pythons.
###83 I investigated a very similar case in Lancashire in 2002.
###87 Witnesses there said there was something the size of a car
###90 swimming around, attacking full grown swans.
###93 And I was saying to my colleague, there is no way a
###96 big predator can live in this lake.
###97 There's no way.
###98 Half an hour later, I was eating my words, because I saw
###101 it come to the surface no more than six feet away from me,
###104 and it was an 8 foot long wels catfish.
###106 [THREATENING MEOW-LIKE ROAR]
###108 RICHARD FREEMAN: Whether it is still on this stretch of the
###111 river or not, I don't know.
###112 The river starts in Luton, and it ends up in the Thames, so
###116 the creature could be anywhere.
###117 It's a tradition to give monsters names.
###120 The Loch Ness monster is called Nessie.
###122 The monster of Loch Morag is called Morag.
###124 The monster of Lake Okanagan in Canada is Ogopogo.
###127 So I would like to take this opportunity to officially call
###131 the Olympic monster of the River Lea Old Greg.
###136 [VAGUELY THREATENING MOO]
###140 
###145 FEMALE SPEAKER: So another fallacy of the Green Games is
###147 what's actually happening to places like Leyton Marshes,
###150 which is, if you've ever been there, it's one of those parts
###152 of London that makes you think that you're not actually in
###154 London, if you ignore the pile up.
###156 So when they started digging all this green land up, they
###159 suddenly went, oh, there's a reason why there's been mounds
###161 of earth and piles of earth on top of it.
###163 It's because there's a lot of asbestos from the buildings
###165 from before the Second World War.
###167 Oh, dear, this is a problem.
###168 And the other thing they've done to that now is because
###170 it's a greenfield site-- don't know if you know what a
###172 greenfield site is, but it's a patch of land that hasn't
###175 actually been developed on--
###177 once you've put a temporary structure like a basketball
###179 court on there, it suddenly become a Brownfield site.
###181 So it sets this legal precedent, which then means
###184 you can then sell that land and the sky above it for
###187 further regeneration.
###187 [WHISTLING AND DRUMMING]
###200 CAROLINE DAY: It's been very hard for us to
###202 make our voice known.
###203 That's why we're here today.
###204 That's why we have to come, and we have to make a racket.
###207 It's not because we haven't exhausted
###209 every legitimate channel.
###210 Because we have, and we have not been listened to.
###213 [WHISTLING AND DRUMMING]
###218 CLAIRE WEISS: In Waltham Forest, we have really done
###221 badly in terms of legacy from the Olympic Games.
###224 We've seen how much damage has been done to the lands on
###228 Leyton Marsh.
###229 They have dug up what was under there, the contents of a
###232 landfill site.
###234 And we believe the whole thing is too high a price to pay for
###240 five weeks of games into our countryside in one of the
###245 poorest parts of the capital.
###248 MALE SPEAKER: The whole thing all along is
###250 mirror image language.
###251 It's the opposite of what it says.
###252 So you see a big sign saying, improving the image of
###255 construction, when you're ripping some building down and
###259 digging a major hole in the ground.
###260 So it actually means improving the image of destruction, and
###264 regeneration generally means degeneration.
###267 What is this?
###268 This is two, three weeks worth of sports day stuff that is
###272 supposed to totally reinvent 500, 1,000 years of London
###277 history, and just brush it aside for a
###281 corporate sports day.
###282 
###291 LIZ SCOTT: The word Olympic didn't come into the games
###293 here until 1636.
###296 The games were started in 1612.
###299 Because the Olympic games had stayed here since the 1600s,
###304 the Olympics Commission came here to learn about the
###307 Olympic Games.
###308 So that is really special.
###311 JAMES WISEMAN: One second, I'm just going to put my phone on
###313 silent, and in my little man bag.
###316 All right.
###317 OK.
###318 So it was a much bigger event 400 years ago.
###320 They had things like horse racing going on.
###323 There was wrestling, which we still do a little bit of.
###325 One of the most popular events involved a person holding a
###327 pig and attempting to sing at the same time.
###330 Well, it's a piglet, really, rather than a pig, but if you
###332 imagine the piglet, it's going to wriggle quite a lot, and so
###334 you've got to try and hold it while
###336 singing at the same time.
###337 Climbing the greasy pole, where women would scramble to
###340 get to the top of a greasy pole and retrieve some
###343 petticoats from the top, which they then won.
###345 PETE "BUZZSAW" HOLLAND: When you learn swordsmanship with a
###348 traditional English backsword such as this, which is the
###350 steel sword, obviously when you're training to sword
###352 fight, it's a very dangerous art and skill to learn.
###357 So traditionally, people would use a wooden
###359 waster, use the cudgel.
###360 PHILLIP PITT: Basically, you're out to hit anywhere.
###363 Try to be careful of, obviously, the groin area.
###366 It's quite painful.
###368 I got my kneecap split open with a steel a couple of
###370 months ago.
###371 That wasn't pleasant.
###373 Very serious, drew blood.
###375 PETE "BUZZSAW" HOLLAND: Originally, opposed to
###376 fighting for a prize bag of money, you would fight for a
###380 good hat with a good cockade of feathers.
###383 If at the end of the day that you won and you became
###385 champion, just wearing the hat around the local community was
###391 such a symbol of kudos, if you like.
###394 JED "JOKER" PASCOE: It was super 16th century, 17th
###397 century bling.
###398 [CHEERING]
###401 JAMES WISEMAN: Shin kicking is probably the most popular
###403 event for spectators.
###405 Personally, I don't see why they couldn't have shin
###407 kicking in the Olympics.
###408 There's certainly some other sports in the Olympics which I
###411 think you could quite easily replace.
###413 Probably synchronized swimming could be
###416 replaced with shin kicking.
###417 I think people just like watching people get hurt.
###421 MALE SPEAKER: I like this because it is a community
###424 event, whereas the hardest sport lover in the middle of
###427 London is going to be hard pushed to feel it's really on
###430 their store step as a community event.
###433 JAMES WISEMAN: This has always been
###433 about being very inclusive.
###434 Doesn't matter who you are.
###435 Again, in terms of the sports, anybody can enter the sports.
###439 There's no us and them.
###440 There's no corporate sponsors and VIP's box and all that.
###444 It's all everybody's in it together.
###445 
###456 MALE SPEAKER: You've got the manager franchises, Coca-Cola
###458 and McDonald's.
###459 And this is an eco green games.
###461 Dow Chemicals have been responsible for horrors in
###464 India, are doing the wrap that goes around the Olympic
###467 stadium, making it look like a wedding cake.
###469 Everything is just turned on its head.
###472 Everything is absurd, and quite ridiculous.
###475 
###479 MEREDITH ALEXANDER: When London bid to host the Games,
###481 we promised the world that we would have the most
###484 sustainable Games ever.
###485 And until January, I was a member of something called the
###488 Commission for a Sustainable London 2012.
###491 We were asked to look at the deal that the London Games
###494 organizers had with Dow Chemical.
###497 And the more I looked into it, the more compelling evidence
###500 was presented to me by organizations like Amnesty
###503 International and the Bhopal Medical Appeal to show that
###506 Dow Chemical bears
###507 responsibility for this tragedy.
###509 In the end, I wasn't able to feel comfortable being part of
###514 a body that defended Dow Chemical and claimed that it
###519 was a sustainable company.
###522 COLIN TOOGOOD: On the night of the 2nd, 3rd December, 1984,
###525 there was a huge gas leak from a pesticide factory, Union
###529 Carbide owned pesticide factory in Bhopal.
###531 This was a factory that was in a very poor state, and it's
###534 true to say that even the safety systems had been
###536 switched off.
###537 So unfortunately, the people there didn't
###539 stand much of a chance.
###540 The gas was incredibly poisonous.
###543 In the first 72 hours, there was 7,000 to
###545 10,000 people killed.
###548 Now, we accept that Dow never owned or operated the plant,
###551 as we are so often told in the media, but they did acquire
###554 Union Carbide out right.
###556 And they have a very strange relationship with Union
###558 Carbide, which is one of not just ownership.
###561 They're effectively one and the same.
###564 High level executives from one sit on the board of the other.
###567 MEREDITH ALEXANDER: Dow Chemical in Bhopal is
###569 responsible for a situation that is seeing generation
###572 after generation of children born with the most appalling
###575 birth defects.
###576 The tragic irony of them sponsoring the Paralympics is
###581 pretty overwhelming, to be frank.
###582 
###585 MALE SPEAKER: Sponsors like BP--
###587 these large people who've been associated with all kinds of
###591 forms of pollution--
###593 are actually now wearing the green jacket of being the eco
###597 heroes rescuing this wonderful park land that we're going to
###600 be handed back.
###602 
###604 MEREDITH ALEXANDER: Rio Tinto is providing the medals that
###606 actually go around the athlete's neck.
###608 These are one of the most iconic images of the Games.
###611 But unfortunately, the metal comes from mines that are
###615 really environmentally problematic.
###617 And the local communities are fighting to get those mines
###620 either closed down or run more responsibly.
###622 
###625 BENNY WENDA: My name is Benny Wenda.
###626 I am from West Papua.
###628 I am also ex political prisoner and independent
###630 leader, and now I'm living in exile.
###635 Rio Tinto is a part of the problem in West Papua.
###639 Even the human rights violations, our mountain been
###642 destroyed, our river polluted.
###644 These companies are indirectly or directly support Indonesia
###650 committed genocide my people.
###652 Rio Tinto need to admit it.
###654 Their gold is the blood of my people.
