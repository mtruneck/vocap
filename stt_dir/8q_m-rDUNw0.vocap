###11 STEVE LUDWIN: I'm going to show you the effects of the
###13 hemotoxin in venom on blood, OK?
###17 
###20 And you can already see pretty quickly, it's kind of
###23 congealing.
###24 It's quite gloopy.
###27 And I'm beginning to wonder if that's such a good thing to be
###29 happening in my body.
###30 Sometimes I think, god, that can't be good.
###36 I don't have a medical background.
###37 I have no fucking idea what it's doing to my body.
###41 If I did die due to snake venom or whatever, I'm sure
###44 it'll be quite funny to a lot of people.
###46 And they'll go, you see?
###47 You see?
###48 And even to myself, as I was floating out of my body and
###51 looking down below, I'm sure I'd be laughing my ass off.
###54 Like, you idiot.
###56 You're not supposed to inject snake venom, you fool.
###58 
###80 My name is Steve Ludwin, and I've been self-immunizing with
###85 various snake venoms for well over 20 years now.
###89 I'm kind of embarrassed.
###90 I mean, I don't know have that medical background.
###93 I don't even have a proper
###94 American high school education.
###97 There's been quite a few doctors and scientists that
###101 have been horrified by my lack of having things that are
###104 sterile and stuff like that.
###106 
###109 We have our Lower Baja rattlesnake.
###112 
###118 And bang.
###119 You see that?
###121 That's one unhappy rattle snake.
###125 Relax.
###126 
###130 I've always been in good health.
###131 I haven't had something like the flu in
###134 coming up on nine winters.
###136 And as I've gotten older, people have started to
###139 comment, oh wow, you don't seem like you're 46 years old.
###142 I had some doctors do tests on my skin, and they were all
###145 kind of a little bit baffled.
###148 All right, buddy.
###149 Up.
###150 This girl doesn't really like it very much.
###154 This is why I'm always nervous holding a viper because they
###157 can spin their fangs around and actually go through their
###159 lip to get your fingers.
###163 This snake is not wanting to be milked.
###164 Sometimes that happens.
###166 
###170 I had quite an unusual sort of upbringing.
###173 I'm the son of a Pan Am pilot.
###175 I had a real "Catch Me If You Can" Leonardo
###178 DiCaprio sort of lifestyle.
###180 I had a credit card.
###181 It just said Pan Am on it with my name, Steve Ludwin, and I
###185 could get on any plane, as long as I was
###186 wearing a tie, for free.
###190 My father took me down to the Miami Serpetarium, when I was
###193 about nine years old, and I got to meet this now famous
###198 herpetologist called Bill Haast.
###200 He was the first westerner to start injecting himself with
###204 snake venom.
###204 He started in 1948.
###207 I was very young and impressionable.
###209 I loved snakes.
###210 From that moment on after meeting him, I was like wow,
###213 you can become immune to snake venom?
###215 This is crazy.
###216 That's called vaccinology.
###217 It's the oldest form of medicine apparently.
###221 When I was about 17, I was like, I've got to get that
###225 venom into me somehow.
###228 This is called a Pope's tree viper, and I'm a little bit
###234 wary of them.
###235 But it's a beautiful snake.
###237 Don't know if you can see those fangs.
###238 Do you see that fang?
###240 It's a hemotoxin and it's going to cause massive tissue
###243 destruction.
###244 People have died from these snakes, so you do not want
###248 that on your finger.
###251 I moved to London in 1987, and I started working in East End.
###256 It was called The Vivarium.
###257 And basically my job for 1 pound 60 an hour was to unpack
###262 cobras and scorpions and tarantulas and reptiles for
###267 zoos and laboratories.
###268 
###272 See you later.
###274 I started bringing the venomous snakes home.
###277 My first time doing it was crazy.
###280 I had never even milked a snake before, and I just kind
###283 of had to figure it out on my own.
###285 So what I would do is I would take a scalpel and scratch
###289 like two little scratch marks into my arm.
###291 I would take a little bit of the venom, and I would drop it
###294 into the cut.
###295 And you could feel it the first time.
###297 It was like ah, that burns.
###298 I quickly washed it off because I was scared.
###301 I was like, what is this going to do?
###302 It kind of swelled up and my heart started pounding, not
###305 because of the venom, because it was like, oh my god, is
###307 this going to stop?
###308 Is it going to kill me?
###309 I had no idea.
###312 Since people have kind of heard what I've been doing and
###315 stuff like that, I've seen a lot of people bitching.
###317 They're worse than like "Star Trek" fans, to be honest with
###319 you, reptile people sometimes.
###323 I always thought when the internet came, I was like,
###325 wow, you can communicate with other people that have the
###327 same passion about these animals.
###330 But it's not the case.
###331 There's a lot of bitchiness and who has the biggest snake.
###336 I don't keep big snakes.
###337 Guys that keep big snakes are hiding a secret.
###339 
###342 This is the last hemotoxic snake that goes into my
###346 snakebite cocktail.
###347 This is called an eyelash viper.
###349 This is one of the scariest snakes that I own.
###351 This the snake that bit me.
###352 The worst pain that I've ever had in my life.
###355 And I've had lots of accidents with venom.
###357 But it felt like you had put your hand down on a marble
###361 table and someone took a sledgehammer and smashed it
###365 onto your pinky.
###366 But the funny thing is that that pain never subsided for
###369 eight fucking hours.
###371 And I had some scientists in the States saying get yourself
###373 to the hospital.
###374 This is not a good snake to be bitten by.
###376 But I kind of waited it out.
###377 I had confidence that I was going to be OK.
###379 But it's a really aggressive snake, and it's
###382 really tricky to milk.
###383 
###387 There you go.
###388 Whoa, there's lots of venom coming out there.
###390 Thank you.
###392 So those are our hemotoxins.
###393 
###398 I posted a really beautiful snake that I have on YouTube.
###402 It's called a macrops pit viper.
###404 Just because I'm handling this snake,
###406 it's called free handling.
###407 There's death threats and people have just gone crazy.
###411 I could poke it in my eye a million times and
###413 it would not bite.
###415 "These snakes can and will kill you.
###418 Everybody take a good long look.
###420 The moron attached to that arm is the reason why you have
###423 trouble keeping your reptiles legally." I'm not a moron
###426 attached to this arm.
###428 Oh, yes I am.
###431 "To think we lock up pedophiles and murderers when
###434 sickos like this are free to roam our streets.
###437 What's wrong with the world these days?" Now, I think
###440 that's somebody being sarcastic.
###443 OK, here is a good one.
###445 "You, to put it kindly, are an ignorant fucktard.
###448 I sincerely hope you get bit hard.
###453 And I strongly dissuade anyone watching this video from
###456 repeating the actions of this small-penised individual.
###460 Stupid dick hammer." Now, that's good.
###463 That's good.
###464 
###468 This next snake is the Naja kaouthia which is responsible
###472 for a lot of deaths every year.
###474 In the time that I've been working with this snake, I've
###476 had some injections where I was a little bit cocky with it
###479 and got the dilution sort of wrong.
###482 They were like volcanoes.
###484 I had three of them.
###485 I had two on this leg and one down here.
###487 And they were growing and growing and burning.
###489 And for days, I was like, oh god, I
###491 could feel this pressure.
###492 I touched it and goo shot out five foot
###495 across onto the carpet.
###497 And I was just like, oh my god.
###499 Oh fuck.
###500 I'm fucked here.
###503 And I got this massive needle for
###505 injecting horses or something.
###507 I put on some ACDC and it just gave me the strength just to--
###511 against all your will, just push this down and you could
###514 feel it going down into something.
###515 Do I have the nucleus yet?
###517 I'm pulling on this.
###518 No, I don't think I've got the nucleus.
###519 I think I've gone through it.
###520 Pull it back out, hit the nucleus, and it was just like
###523 pwaaachh, just pulling back on the most disgusting stuff that
###528 you'd ever want to see.
###530 And I was like, oh, I'm just going to squeeze it.
###532 And I squeezed this, but it actually made a sound.
###535 It was like peuh.
###537 I looked down in there and there was a
###538 fucking hole in my leg.
###540 I could see inside my leg where all the tissue had sort
###543 of rotted away.
###544 And I noticed flies coming to it immediately.
###547 And it stunk.
###549 It was like death.
###550 It was rotting.
###551 I never want that happening again.
###553 
###556 You hear it?
###558 This is not the hemotoxic snake.
###560 This is something that's got the neurotoxin, the Naja
###563 kaouthia, which is the monocled cobra.
###567 Simple.
###569 
###573 And let go.
###577 
###581 Since I've kind of discovered the possibilities with the
###583 neurotoxins in this cobra venom, I've been using it in
###588 sporting activities recently and kind of testing it.
###591 It's Kind of added a little bit of extra speed into my
###594 normal abilities.
###596 
###599 I've been doing tests on my skateboard from my house into
###602 the West End.
###603 I see how fast I can get in there.
###605 I just use the roads, and I think the cobra
###607 venom helps with that.
###608 It's just sort of like, I go in between cars, I go in
###611 between buses, I go in the middle of the road.
###612 I just cane it.
###614 I feel like I've got so much energy and speed.
###618 When I'm skating, I've learned to actually start
###621 moving like a snake.
###622 And I found myself just kind of using that S-shape--
###625 carving and carving, and it actually starts giving you a
###628 little bit of power.
###630 
###634 -William Haast, director of the Serpetarium, has had much
###638 experience in handling cobras.
###641 But he still treats them with the greatest respect.
###645 Gather 'round, folks, but not too close.
###648 STEVE LUDWIN: Bill Haast really is my Beatles and
###650 Rolling Stones and Beach Boys all wrapped in one.
###653 He died last year.
###654 He was just like two weeks shy of 101.
###657 He'd say that he hasn't been sick a day in his life, and it
###659 made me start thinking, OK, wow, there's something here.
###662 He was really my parameter of sort of
###665 going, is this dangerous?
###666 It's working for this guy.
###670 He was treating people with polio, people with MS. He had
###673 like 4,000 patients.
###675 He had people that couldn't even walk.
###677 And with the right doses and the right ingredients of his
###681 medicines that contained various snake venoms, people--
###684 I've seen footage of it--
###685 they're playing basketball.
###686 But the FDA heard about what he was doing and they shut him
###690 down, even though he was having such success with it.
###693 But the other thing that Bill Haast did,
###695 which is totally amazing--
###696 it's miraculous.
###697 It almost sounds like a messiah.
###700 Because he was immune to these snake venoms, he's given his
###704 blood to snakebite victims that are dying,
###707 and then they survive.
###708 
###711 I've milked all the snakes.
###712 And I've got hemotoxins in one glass.
###715 This is the one that kind of had the cocktails.
###718 So I'm drawing that venom up into this syringe.
###721 So here's what I was saying earlier.
###722 There's no such thing as a poisonous snake.
###725 It is not poison.
###726 You see that venom coming out there?
###727 See it on my finger?
###729 You can do this.
###731 Completely safely.
###732 If you don't freeze it, it's just like food.
###735 It's a protein, it breaks down.
###736 So I have months and months worth of various venoms.
###743 This is the hemotoxin.
###744 I'm going to put six.
###749 What I have here is water for injections.
###752 
###760 I will start on the actual raw venom, and then what we'll do
###764 is we'll use that injection.
###765 
###768 The first time I tried using the snake
###770 venom was pretty scary.
###772 There was no internet back then.
###775 But it felt really natural.
###776 It felt like it was instinct.
###778 
###781 This is not diluted.
###783 This is the pure venom.
###785 So now, we're going to do an injection
###786 with the diluted hemotoxin.
###787 
###790 The benefits to the hemotoxins, I'm not too sure.
###793 I feel like I need another 20 years to do it.
###796 I had some doctors test my DNA telomeres and when I was 42, I
###800 scored as a 28-year-old.
###802 Perhaps there are some anti-aging
###804 properties to snake venom.
###806 It could all end tomorrow as well.
###808 I'm not saying I'm invincible.
###811 This is the shot glass that has the cobra venom, the
###814 neurotoxin.
###816 
###817 Get it all out.
###819 I'm going with two drops of this.
###822 This actual cobra that we're using is more venomous than a
###826 king cobra.
###827 One drop of cobra venom can kill 20 to 30 grown men.
###835 Yeow.
###836 
###839 Yeah, I mean it just feels--
###840 yeow.
###841 Feels like a bee sting to start off with.
###843 That cobra venom does have a bit of pain to it.
###846 It's like "Man Versus Food," spicy chicken challenge.
###853 Oh, you motherfucker.
###856 I'm 46 now.
###857 I'll have to see how many years I can go on continuing
###860 doing this.
###861 But you do think that it is quite taxing on the body.
###865 It is possible in two years time, my kidneys fail and I
###868 die due to the venom of all those years, of all those
###871 toxins, all the swelling, all the decomposing
###874 flesh and the bruising.
###876 It all has to filter through your kidneys and your liver.
###878 And it's really bad stuff to be going through there.
###883 Yeow, OK.
###884 That was a little bit more than five mil.
###888 People want to know what it feels like.
###890 It feels like injecting Tabasco sauce and
###893 rubbing it in a cut.
###894 It just burns.
###896 I will take another syringe here, and just basically bring
###903 that raw venom down with the needle, which I quite
###908 like to work that.
###910 Diluting is something that's been quite new to me over like
###912 the last four years that I've learned how
###914 to do and work properly.
###916 I was a bit nervous today when I was milking the snakes.
###919 But when I do these injections, I don't think
###922 anything of that.
###923 Once I know that the dilutions are right, it's as normal as
###927 anything for me now.
###929 I always kind of note the time just in case if I ever did
###932 have any problems where I did need to visit the hospital
###936 again, I would know.
###937 
###942 The one time I did have a serious overdose, I injected
###947 three raw venoms a couple years ago.
###949 And I only wanted to put down a little bit in.
###951 And as I was pressing it, just ooop--
###953 the whole thing went in.
###954 Within 45 minutes, my hand was like a baseball mitt.
###959 The venom was swimming in my body.
###961 I had some friends come over because
###962 they knew I was fucked.
###964 They were saying, go to the hospital, go to the hospital.
###965 And I just didn't want to.
###966 And the next morning, I kept on waking up and it wasn't
###969 going down.
###969 So I got begged to go to the hospital.
###972 They saw my arm and they said, what happened?
###974 And I said snakebite.
###975 Three doctors came out and they said, well,
###978 what snake bit you?
###979 And I had to just say, well, I didn't get bit.
###983 There's three snakes.
###984 I purposely injected it into my arm.
###986 They didn't know what to say, and the next thing I know, I
###988 was being taken into another room.
###990 And one of the female doctors just came in and was just
###992 yelling at me and just saying, you idiot.
###994 You can't do this.
###996 And they were telling me you're going to die, and
###997 you're going to lose your arm.
###1000 I was in intensive care for three days.
###1002 But I was kind of calm throughout the whole thing.
###1005 I don't want to ever repeat it.
###1007 
###1020 Since I had heard that the Americans and the Chinese got
###1024 busted injecting race horses with cobra venom and it was
###1027 making them outperform their abilities, I
###1029 immediately got excited.
###1030 And I thought boxing would be a great thing to kind of see--
###1034 is it possible that I could outperform my ability?
###1036 
###1040 I was working it harder last year when I was on my own.
###1043 I actually felt like something was happening.
###1046 I was like holy shit, this stuff is working.
###1048 It's amazing.
###1049 You're discreet, but you can get away with it in London.
###1051 
###1057 Bear Grylls.
###1059 I hate that guy.
###1060 In those films, he's like, oh, here's the snake.
###1063 And you can just bit its head off.
###1064 And he does.
###1065 He's killed snakes on TV.
###1067 That's my fucking family you're fucking around with.
###1069 Sorry, just kidding.
###1071 
###1074 One thing I have noticed is that I'm not really feeling
###1077 the pain, so that could be the other thing that helped those
###1080 horses along.
###1081 Why not find out why it's doing these things.
###1084 If it's taking away pain, if it's giving you
###1086 confidence, or whatever.
###1087 Why not give it to your army?
###1089 
###1096 Christopher Columbus didn't go looking for America to
###1099 discover America.
###1100 He was looking for the fountain of youth.
###1102 What does mankind want?
###1104 They want to live longer.
###1106 Everyone wants to live longer.
###1107 
###1118 Apparently, there's something in snake venom that helps its
###1122 food to accept death.
###1124 
###1128 I did feel that once.
###1129 As I was lying there, and I could feel the numbness in my
###1132 head and stuff, I had this complete feeling of, oh well,
###1138 I might die here, but I felt really happy to die.
###1141 
###1152 My heart's pounding.
###1154 You're alive for a good 6 to 12 hours.
###1157 Like Starbucks has nothing on this.
###1162 Yeah, I must admit that it doesn't feel great.
###1165 It's kind of like Jell-O in there.
###1168 And god knows what it's doing in there.
###1170 I wish I understood what's happening beneath that skin.
###1175 The next day is always the same with the cobra venom.
###1177 It just feels like you're beaten up anyway.
###1180 And then I have a good sort of four days where I feel kind of
###1183 quite charged.
###1184 Come on, let's box.
###1185 Come on.
###1186 Come on.
###1187 There you go.
###1189 -So how many years have you been doing this?
###1191 STEVE LUDWIN: Over 20 years, probably like 22 years--
###1193 -So you've been quite lucky then, really.
###1195 Is there a risk that you take that venom and it
###1199 could just kill you?
###1199 STEVE LUDWIN: It is kind of a little bit playing with fire.
###1202 I've had maybe three incidents in my life where it was
###1206 borderline life threatening.
###1208 -What you're saying is it's similar to someone taking
###1210 heroin or cocaine and injecting it
###1212 and taking a gamble.
###1213 So you're gambling with your life every time you take it.
###1215 STEVE LUDWIN: I've gotten so used to it, I do it without
###1218 thinking about it.
###1219 And because I know the amounts and I know not to push it and
###1222 where not to push it and stuff, it seems
###1224 really safe to me.
###1225 This certainly isn't physically addictive or it
###1228 isn't pleasurable.
###1229 -So you believe you could stop tomorrow and stop taking it,
###1230 stop doing it?
###1231 STEVE LUDWIN: Yeah.
###1232 Yeah.
###1233 I'd like to do that very soon.
###1234 I've done it for so long.
###1235 I'd like to actually spend--
###1237 I'd like to take a year off.
###1238 -And you've done that, you managed that?
###1240 STEVE LUDWIN: No, I've never done it.
###1242 I've never not done it.
###1243 But I'd like to take like a year off.
###1244 -So you're not going to know if it's addictive until you
###1247 try it, are you?
###1247 -Is it possible you could be addicted to pain then, if you
###1250 know what I mean?
###1251 The way it hurts.
###1253 STEVE LUDWIN: I think if I was, I would have other things
###1256 in my life.
###1257 I'd be a boxer like you.
###1259 -Yeah, true, true, true.
###1260 
###1263 STEVE LUDWIN: The day after going boxing, my arm just was
###1267 even more swollen than the day before.
###1269 But I felt like a truck had hit me.
###1271 I felt like I was being digested from the inside.
###1275 I was walking around like the Elephant Man for a day.
###1279 I can kind of remember it, but I was like in a dream state.
###1282 I felt like I had been injected with a thousand
###1286 energy drinks.
###1288 It just felt slightly wrong.
###1291 
###1298 I would really like to work with a forward-thinking
###1301 company that is going to go, OK kid, we like your ideas.
###1304 Let's start researching this.
###1306 And around-the-clock and get it done.
###1310 I visited the University of Southern California a couple
###1313 years ago, and I met a professor Frank Markland, I
###1316 believe his name is.
###1317 He's been working with copperhead venom.
###1320 Copperhead venom is the North American pit viper that's
###1323 being used.
###1323 They've been studying the effects on breast cancer
###1326 cells, ovarian cancer.
###1328 It actually inhibits the growth of tumors and basically
###1332 kind of kills off cancer cells.
###1334 So there there's real excitement around that.
###1338 Yeah, the possibilities of a cancer cure someday with snake
###1342 venom, I'd put my money on it.
###1343 
###1360 Banana?
###1361 
###1365 Banana.
###1367
