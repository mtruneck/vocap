CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: There is a storm out
there that`s potentially effecting tens of


2
0:0:4,4 --> 0:0:8,83
millions of people, including a lot of folks
in our audience. We`re going in depth on Hurricane


3
0:0:8,83 --> 0:0:18,29
Sandy today, on CNN STUDENT NEWS.


4
0:0:18,29 --> 0:0:36,829
23 states, nearly half the country. On Monday
afternoon, that`s how many were under some


5
0:0:36,829 --> 0:0:42,329
kind of warning or advisory for wind related
to Hurricane Sandy. This is the view of Sandy


6
0:0:42,329 --> 0:0:47,26
from the international space station. It`s
huge. All that white stuff, that`s Sandy`s


7
0:0:47,26 --> 0:0:52,21
wind field. If that were a country, it would
be the 20th biggest country in the world.


8
0:0:52,21 --> 0:0:56,6
But you really start to understand its power
and intensity when you are on the ground.


9
0:0:56,6 --> 0:1:2,64
The rain is torrential, and the wind - yesterday
it was consistently blowing at about 90 miles


10
0:1:2,64 --> 0:1:6,89
per hour. Then, there is something called
the storm surge. That`s the combination of


11
0:1:6,89 --> 0:1:12,33
a storm and high tide. You see those waves
off the coast of Massachusetts? Storms like


12
0:1:12,33 --> 0:1:18,369
this drive those waves higher, some areas
were expecting a storm surge 11 feet above


13
0:1:18,369 --> 0:1:22,11
normal high tide. That could lead to severe
flooding.


14
0:1:22,11 --> 0:1:26,46
Some officials say that the damage from Hurricane
Sandy could be unprecedented. One government


15
0:1:26,46 --> 0:1:31,81
model says we could be looking at more than
$7 billion in damages, and that`s just from


16
0:1:31,81 --> 0:1:37,25
the wind. When it comes to storms that make
landfall in the northeastern U.S., this is


17
0:1:37,25 --> 0:1:42,939
the one all the others get compared to. The
Long Island Hurricane of 1938. One of the


18
0:1:42,939 --> 0:1:47,549
things that experts look at when they are
measuring hurricanes is the low pressure reading.


19
0:1:47,549 --> 0:1:53,15
Usually, the lower the pressure, the stronger
the storm. The 1938 hurricane had a low pressure


20
0:1:53,15 --> 0:2:1,78
reading of 946 millibars. Sandy`s low pressure
reading -- 943. I asked CNN`s Chad Myers about


21
0:2:1,78 --> 0:2:3,64
the comparison between these two storms.


22
0:2:3,64 --> 0:2:4,13
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


23
0:2:4,13 --> 0:2:8,17
CHAD MYERS, AMS METEOROLOGIST: The problem
with this storm call is that people took it


24
0:2:8,17 --> 0:2:15,14
as a category one. It had the pressure of
a category two or three, the wind field of


25
0:2:15,14 --> 0:2:20,569
a category one hurricane, but yet the surge
of a category two or three. When it got north


26
0:2:20,569 --> 0:2:26,39
of Cape Hatteras, and kept getting stronger,
the pressure of this storm was deeper, it


27
0:2:26,39 --> 0:2:32,5
was a stronger storm than the 1938 storm that
just rolled right over Long Island. This was


28
0:2:32,5 --> 0:2:37,33
always a dangerous storm, we knew it in the
pressure. Sometimes you just can`t tell people,


29
0:2:37,33 --> 0:2:41,72
hey, it`s a cat one, take cover, because they
say ah, it`s just a cat one, we don`t care.


30
0:2:41,72 --> 0:2:44,849
This was much, much more than a category one
hurricane.


31
0:2:44,849 --> 0:2:45,33
(END VIDEOTAPE)


32
0:2:45,33 --> 0:2:48,66
AZUZ: All right, thanks, Chad. There is something
else going on with Hurricane Sandy that could


33
0:2:48,66 --> 0:2:54,12
make its impact even worse. It`s the possibility
that this could turn into a super storm. Now,


34
0:2:54,12 --> 0:2:58,44
let me show you what we mean by that. There
is Sandy spinning off the East Coast, and


35
0:2:58,44 --> 0:3:2,41
that high pressure system is keeping it from
moving out into the Atlantic. Then there is


36
0:3:2,41 --> 0:3:7,42
this cold front moving in from the west. What
happens is that when the cold air and the


37
0:3:7,42 --> 0:3:12,98
warm air meet up and make Sandy more powerful,
and you can see there, it keeps the storm


38
0:3:12,98 --> 0:3:17,709
in that same area, just sitting right over
that part of the country. When it`s all said


39
0:3:17,709 --> 0:3:22,55
and done, Sandy could end up affecting up
to 60 million people. Some states have mandatory


40
0:3:22,55 --> 0:3:27,11
evacuations, thousands of people spent the
night at shelters like this one. Hundreds


41
0:3:27,11 --> 0:3:32,19
of thousands of people lost power, and school
was canceled for millions of students. We


42
0:3:32,19 --> 0:3:35,819
heard from some of you on Facebook and Twitter
about that.


43
0:3:35,819 --> 0:3:40,3
Hurricane Sandy is even having an impact on
the race for the White House. President Obama


44
0:3:40,3 --> 0:3:46,3
and Republican presidential nominee Romney,
both altered or canceled campaign events yesterday.


45
0:3:46,3 --> 0:3:49,97
Instead of next week`s election, they were
focused on the storm and the people in its


46
0:3:49,97 --> 0:3:50,99
path.


47
0:3:50,99 --> 0:3:50,5
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


48
0:3:50,5 --> 0:3:52,72
BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA: We anticipate that there are going


49
0:3:52,72 --> 0:4:0,11
to be a lot of trees down, a lot of water
and despite the fact that the power companies


50
0:4:0,11 --> 0:4:5,459
are working very closely with the various
state officials and local officials to make


51
0:4:5,459 --> 0:4:10,72
sure that they are bringing in as many assets
as possible and getting those ready in preparation


52
0:4:10,72 --> 0:4:14,2
for the storm, the fact is that a lot of these
emergency crews are not going to be able to


53
0:4:14,2 --> 0:4:19,119
get into position to start restoring power
until some of these winds have died down.


54
0:4:19,119 --> 0:4:22,669
MITT ROMNEY, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:
We faced these kinds of challenges before.


55
0:4:22,669 --> 0:4:27,21
And as we have, it`s interesting to see how
Americans come together, and this, this looks


56
0:4:27,21 --> 0:4:32,65
like another time when we need to come together,
all across the country, even here in Ohio,


57
0:4:32,65 --> 0:4:36,189
and make sure that we give of our support
to the people who need it.


58
0:4:36,189 --> 0:4:37,59
(END VIDEO CLIP)


59
0:4:37,59 --> 0:4:41,5
AZUZ: Campaigning is on halt for the hurricane.
The election is still going to happen, it`s


60
0:4:41,5 --> 0:4:44,599
just a week away, and what we are going to
do this week is look at where the candidates


61
0:4:44,599 --> 0:4:49,259
stand on some of the issues. Today`s topic
is education. During his first term in the


62
0:4:49,259 --> 0:4:53,52
White House, President Obama launched a program
called "Race to the Top". It offers money


63
0:4:53,52 --> 0:4:58,27
from the federal government to states for
coming up with plans to meet national standards


64
0:4:58,27 --> 0:5:3,27
and improve teacher quality and plans to turn
around low performing schools. The president


65
0:5:3,27 --> 0:5:6,399
also supports the development of charter schools.


66
0:5:6,399 --> 0:5:10,909
Governor Romney`s education plan is called
"A Chance for Every Child." He also supports


67
0:5:10,909 --> 0:5:15,77
national standards, but he said that education
policies should come more from the state and


68
0:5:15,77 --> 0:5:21,729
local level rather than from the federal government.
Governor Romney`s plan also focuses on choice.


69
0:5:21,729 --> 0:5:26,439
He said he wants to give some parents the
ability to choose where their kids go to school.


70
0:5:26,439 --> 0:5:31,52
Yesterday, we looked at the electoral college,
the system that determines who wins the presidency.


71
0:5:31,52 --> 0:5:35,8
We looked at some scenarios for both Governor
Romney and President Obama to get enough votes


72
0:5:35,8 --> 0:5:40,27
to win the election. One other possibility
came up at the end of that report yesterday.


73
0:5:40,27 --> 0:5:43,749
A tie. Now, Josh Levs looks at what could
happen.


74
0:5:43,749 --> 0:5:44,389
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


75
0:5:44,389 --> 0:5:49,9
JOSH LEVS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It could happen,
and it would throw the race into confusion


76
0:5:49,9 --> 0:5:54,159
and controversy. What if President Barack
Obama and Mitt Romney tie in the electoral


77
0:5:54,159 --> 0:6:0,939
college with 269 votes each? There is an amendment
for that. Here is how it works. In January,


78
0:6:0,939 --> 0:6:5,529
the new House of Representatives would choose
the president, with each state getting one


79
0:6:5,529 --> 0:6:11,399
vote. Republicans will almost surely have
the majority in that vote and choose Romney.


80
0:6:11,399 --> 0:6:16,689
But not Paul Ryan. The vice president gets
decided by the Senate. If that`s still in


81
0:6:16,689 --> 0:6:22,139
Democratic control, Biden would almost surely
win. So, thanks to the electoral system, we


82
0:6:22,139 --> 0:6:26,789
could have a Romney-Biden White House.


83
0:6:26,789 --> 0:6:31,46
But there is also another possibility. Let`s
go back to that electoral college tie. These


84
0:6:31,46 --> 0:6:35,879
are the votes electors are expected to take,
based on the votes in their states. But they


85
0:6:35,879 --> 0:6:41,309
don`t all legally have to. Some states don`t
have laws to punish faithless electors who


86
0:6:41,309 --> 0:6:47,59
go their own way. So, if there is a tie, expect
swayable electors to suddenly become very,


87
0:6:47,59 --> 0:6:51,33
very popular to some, and a source of anger
to others.


88
0:6:51,33 --> 0:6:52,479
(END VIDEOTAPE)


89
0:6:52,479 --> 0:6:58,199
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today, "Shoutout" goes
out to Mr. Uselding`s social studies classes


90
0:6:58,199 --> 0:7:3,8
at St. Frances Cabrini Catholic School in
West Bend, Wisconsin. Which of these U.S.


91
0:7:3,8 --> 0:7:11,279
military branches was established last? Here
we go, was it the Army, Navy, Air Force or


92
0:7:11,279 --> 0:7:20,289
Marines? You`ve got three seconds, go!


93
0:7:20,289 --> 0:7:26,379
The Air Force was established as its own military
branch in 1947. Before that, it was part of


94
0:7:26,379 --> 0:7:31,639
the U.S. Army. That`s your answer, and that`s
your "Shoutout."


95
0:7:31,639 --> 0:7:37,839
AZUZ: OK, I`ve heard of a chain-linked fence,
a white-picket fence, even a defense. But


96
0:7:37,839 --> 0:7:42,379
a space fence -- that`s a real thing. The
Air Force has been in charge of it for decades,


97
0:7:42,379 --> 0:7:49,289
but the fence needs some repairs, about $3.5
billion worth. The space fence program is


98
0:7:49,289 --> 0:7:54,289
a series of radar signals. What they do is
track space junk. Some pieces are as small


99
0:7:54,289 --> 0:7:58,689
as a soft ball, others are as big as a bus.
And it`s good to have a heads up if one of


100
0:7:58,689 --> 0:8:2,919
those is heading towards the International
Space Station or satellite that carries TV


101
0:8:2,919 --> 0:8:8,629
signals or cell phone service. The Air Force
tracks about 20,000 pieces of space junk,


102
0:8:8,629 --> 0:8:14,389
but it`s estimated that there are ten times
that much junk floating around out there.


103
0:8:14,389 --> 0:8:20,489
The military wants to restring the space fence,
so to speak, before something slips through.


104
0:8:20,489 --> 0:8:24,55
Washington State University head football
coach, Mike Leach, hasn`t posted anything


105
0:8:24,55 --> 0:8:28,61
on Twitter in a couple of weeks. And hopefully,
his players haven`t either. Because if they


106
0:8:28,61 --> 0:8:34,9
do, and coach Leach finds out about it, he
says they`ll be suspended from the team. The


107
0:8:34,9 --> 0:8:38,399
coach banned his players from using the social
media service last week. The school`s athletic


108
0:8:38,399 --> 0:8:43,899
director said some players posted inappropriate
tweets. He described them as vulgar. Some


109
0:8:43,899 --> 0:8:47,889
Washington State students think this is a
good decision, since the players represent


110
0:8:47,889 --> 0:8:52,35
the school; others think the coach shouldn`t
be allowed to take away a player`s right to


111
0:8:52,35 --> 0:8:53,8
use Twitter.


112
0:8:53,8 --> 0:8:57,129
What do you think of the coach`s decision
to keep players off Twitter? Do you agree


113
0:8:57,129 --> 0:9:2,22
it will help prevent distractions, or do you
think it stifles their speech? Cnnstudentnews.com


114
0:9:2,22 --> 0:9:4,389
is the place to tell us.


115
0:9:4,389 --> 0:9:8,389
Before we go, we know a lot of you out there
have gangnam style. We also know that the


116
0:9:8,389 --> 0:9:13,61
leader of the United Nations doesn`t. Well,
not a lot. Here you see him next to international


117
0:9:13,61 --> 0:9:20,339
pop star Psy. Now, Psy tries to show U.N.
Secretary General Ban Ki-moon a little gangnam


118
0:9:20,339 --> 0:9:25,8
style. Ban falls off the horse. He admitted
he was a little jealous of Psy. Ban says he`d


119
0:9:25,8 --> 0:9:30,35
have to relinquish being the world`s most
famous Korean. Of course, in the U.N. workplace,


120
0:9:30,35 --> 0:9:34,81
Ban`s more focused on ergangnomics (ph). And
you can`t really blame the performer, because


121
0:9:34,81 --> 0:9:38,829
he reached for the moon, and with moves like
that, the Psy`s the limit. OK, I`m done. We`ll


122
0:9:38,829 --> 0:11:38,829
see you tomorrow, on CNN STUDENT NEWS.
