1
0:0:0,967 --> 0:0:3,335
Travis Taylor: Now on
Rocket City Rednecks.


2
0:0:3,335 --> 0:0:6,439
We take a remote control
system for toy cars


3
0:0:6,439 --> 0:0:8,574
and put it into
full sized trucks.


4
0:0:8,574 --> 0:0:9,708
Rog: Look at that.


5
0:0:9,708 --> 0:0:11,844
Oh you got
it, go ahead.


6
0:0:11,844 --> 0:0:13,112
Travis Taylor: But will
our remote control


7
0:0:13,112 --> 0:0:18,984
demolition derby end in
victory or disaster?


8
0:0:18,984 --> 0:0:20,719
Rog:<i> [laughing].</i>


9
0:0:20,719 --> 0:0:22,655
Daddy: Uh-oh, look out.


10
0:0:22,655 --> 0:0:23,889
Travis Taylor:
I'm Travis Taylor,


11
0:0:23,889 --> 0:0:25,257
I'm a rocket scientist
in the space and


12
0:0:25,257 --> 0:0:27,193
defense industry
here in my hometown of


13
0:0:27,193 --> 0:0:28,961
Huntsville, Alabama,


14
0:0:28,961 --> 0:0:30,696
where my daddy helped
build the rockets


15
0:0:30,696 --> 0:0:32,131
that sent us to the moon.


16
0:0:32,131 --> 0:0:33,132
Daddy: Have y'all
been drinking


17
0:0:33,132 --> 0:0:34,867
rocket fuel again?


18
0:0:34,867 --> 0:0:36,168
Travis Taylor:
Sometimes big science


19
0:0:36,168 --> 0:0:37,636
moves too slow for me.


20
0:0:37,636 --> 0:0:39,572
So come the
weekend I round up


21
0:0:39,572 --> 0:0:41,6
my best friend Rog.


22
0:0:41,6 --> 0:0:42,108
Rog: Hey.


23
0:0:42,108 --> 0:0:43,242
Travis Taylor: My
nephew Michael


24
0:0:43,242 --> 0:0:44,41
and my buddy Pete


25
0:0:44,41 --> 0:0:46,78
to tackle important
problems with a little


26
0:0:46,78 --> 0:0:48,681
down-home ingenuity.


27
0:0:48,681 --> 0:0:53,419
Rog: Damn it, boy.


28
0:0:53,419 --> 0:0:54,453
Travis Taylor: Right on.


29
0:0:54,453 --> 0:1:1,393
Hey, is there any more
beers in the cooler?


30
0:1:1,393 --> 0:1:2,895
Me and the guys were
fooling around with


31
0:1:2,895 --> 0:1:5,664
remote control toy
cars on a beer can


32
0:1:5,664 --> 0:1:7,5
obstacle course.


33
0:1:7,5 --> 0:1:9,101
One thing led
to another and


34
0:1:9,101 --> 0:1:10,369
before you
know it we had


35
0:1:10,369 --> 0:1:12,972
our own remote control
demolition derby.


36
0:1:12,972 --> 0:1:14,73
Oh.


37
0:1:14,73 --> 0:1:15,241
Michael: Hey
quit that, now,


38
0:1:15,241 --> 0:1:16,275
this is supposed
to be a race.


39
0:1:16,275 --> 0:1:17,543
Travis Taylor: If you
want to be the man,


40
0:1:17,543 --> 0:1:19,712
you got to beat the man.


41
0:1:19,712 --> 0:1:20,913
Look out.


42
0:1:20,913 --> 0:1:22,381
Oh, oh.


43
0:1:22,381 --> 0:1:24,316
Michael gets a little
competitive at times so


44
0:1:24,316 --> 0:1:27,19
when I whooped him at
the RC demolition derby


45
0:1:27,19 --> 0:1:29,688
he challenged me to
take it up a notch,


46
0:1:29,688 --> 0:1:31,857
a real demolition
derby with full sized


47
0:1:31,857 --> 0:1:33,292
remote control cars.


48
0:1:33,292 --> 0:1:34,426
Michael: Yours is
more maneuverable.


49
0:1:34,426 --> 0:1:35,694
If we had real
vehicles I'd be


50
0:1:35,694 --> 0:1:37,229
beating you right now.


51
0:1:37,229 --> 0:1:39,198
Travis Taylor: Now that's
my kind of challenge.


52
0:1:39,198 --> 0:1:40,799
Daddy: You think that's
gonna be easy to do


53
0:1:40,799 --> 0:1:42,535
a real car
remote control?


54
0:1:42,535 --> 0:1:43,869
Travis Taylor: We put
a man on the moon,


55
0:1:43,869 --> 0:1:45,671
we can figure out how to
remote control a car.


56
0:1:45,671 --> 0:1:47,573
Daddy: Well we didn't do
it in the weekends either;


57
0:1:47,573 --> 0:1:49,475
we did it seven days a
week on the mission.


58
0:1:49,475 --> 0:1:50,976
Travis Taylor: Yeah but
that ain't as hard as


59
0:1:50,976 --> 0:1:52,111
walking on the moon.


60
0:1:52,111 --> 0:1:53,312
And Michael, he's
a big RC guy.


61
0:1:53,312 --> 0:1:54,58
We can work on cars.


62
0:1:54,58 --> 0:1:56,715
What could be more
fun than a demolition


63
0:1:56,715 --> 0:1:58,851
derby on the weekend?


64
0:1:58,851 --> 0:2:0,686
Now we just got to
figure out how to add a


65
0:2:0,686 --> 0:2:3,589
remote control
device on a real car.


66
0:2:3,589 --> 0:2:5,758
Oh right.


67
0:2:5,758 --> 0:2:8,527
So we went back to the
garage to figure this out.


68
0:2:8,527 --> 0:2:10,563
You got your steering
column sticks out,


69
0:2:10,563 --> 0:2:12,164
out of your dash.


70
0:2:12,164 --> 0:2:14,6
We were at the chalkboard
working out how we we're


71
0:2:14,6 --> 0:2:16,602
gonna RC up the cars
and putting weapons


72
0:2:16,602 --> 0:2:17,97
and stuff on them.


73
0:2:17,97 --> 0:2:19,838
What if we weld a
blade or something?


74
0:2:19,838 --> 0:2:22,41
What in the crap?


75
0:2:22,41 --> 0:2:24,343
And I look over
at Rog and this thing


76
0:2:24,343 --> 0:2:26,111
crawls out
of his overalls.


77
0:2:26,111 --> 0:2:28,981
I, it's, I, I didn't
even know what it was.


78
0:2:28,981 --> 0:2:31,784
Rog: It's a
little guinea pig.


79
0:2:31,784 --> 0:2:32,918
Travis Taylor: What
are you doing with that


80
0:2:32,918 --> 0:2:34,53
in your pants?


81
0:2:34,53 --> 0:2:35,754
<i> [laughing].</i>


82
0:2:35,754 --> 0:2:36,622
Michael: Yeah.


83
0:2:36,622 --> 0:2:38,23
What's his name, Rog?


84
0:2:38,23 --> 0:2:39,158
Rog: Curly.


85
0:2:39,158 --> 0:2:40,226
Travis Taylor:
He says it's a


86
0:2:40,226 --> 0:2:41,193
hairless guinea pig.


87
0:2:41,193 --> 0:2:42,294
Rog: Feel him.


88
0:2:42,294 --> 0:2:43,162
You know you want to.


89
0:2:43,162 --> 0:2:44,53
Travis Taylor: It
feels like a pig.


90
0:2:44,53 --> 0:2:45,965
It looked to me like
somebody had taken a


91
0:2:45,965 --> 0:2:47,566
squirrel and held it
down and shaved it.


92
0:2:47,566 --> 0:2:48,801
Daddy: What
do they eat?


93
0:2:48,801 --> 0:2:51,7
Rog: They eat carrots
and things like that.


94
0:2:51,7 --> 0:2:52,238
Travis Taylor:
Whatever Rog has got in


95
0:2:52,238 --> 0:2:53,672
them overalls I reckon.


96
0:2:53,672 --> 0:2:55,641
<i> [laughing].</i>


97
0:2:55,641 --> 0:2:57,543
Rog: Yeah, he
done ate it all.


98
0:2:57,543 --> 0:2:58,777
If you ain't
never seen one,


99
0:2:58,777 --> 0:3:1,28
just startling
to look at them.


100
0:3:1,28 --> 0:3:4,35
He's pretty, though,
I think he's neat.


101
0:3:4,35 --> 0:3:5,884
Travis Taylor: We can
put that on the dash.


102
0:3:5,884 --> 0:3:7,419
Well you can pet your
guinea pig we got to


103
0:3:7,419 --> 0:3:9,355
figure out how we're
gonna RC up these cars.


104
0:3:9,355 --> 0:3:10,823
Rog: Let's do it.


105
0:3:10,823 --> 0:3:12,124
Travis Taylor:
We're gonna create a


106
0:3:12,124 --> 0:3:15,294
remote control device
to run a full-sized car.


107
0:3:15,294 --> 0:3:18,564
We'll use a regular toy
remote as the controller;


108
0:3:18,564 --> 0:3:20,899
radio signals will
trigger the servomotors


109
0:3:20,899 --> 0:3:23,502
for the 3 most important
parts of the car,


110
0:3:23,502 --> 0:3:26,71
the gas, the brakes
and the steering.


111
0:3:26,71 --> 0:3:28,707
Once we figure out how
to do it in one car we'll


112
0:3:28,707 --> 0:3:30,409
do it to the second car.


113
0:3:30,409 --> 0:3:32,711
Then we'll crash them
in to each other to see


114
0:3:32,711 --> 0:3:38,217
whose is better in
an RC demolition derby.


115
0:3:38,217 --> 0:3:40,786
Daddy: Great, we're gonna
spend an entire weekend


116
0:3:40,786 --> 0:3:43,589
carefully building two
remote control vehicles,


117
0:3:43,589 --> 0:3:46,25
then destroy them both.


118
0:3:46,25 --> 0:3:48,394
I think there's something
wrong with all these boys.


119
0:3:48,394 --> 0:3:49,995
Travis Taylor: We might
ought to add some stuff


120
0:3:49,995 --> 0:3:52,264
like rockets or some.


121
0:3:52,264 --> 0:3:53,632
Michael: Put some
spikes on it.


122
0:3:53,632 --> 0:3:54,933
Travis Taylor: Harpoons
or some spikes.


123
0:3:54,933 --> 0:3:55,901
Michael: Yeah.


124
0:3:55,901 --> 0:3:56,935
Travis Taylor: Or.


125
0:3:56,935 --> 0:3:58,17
Rog: Put a big manure
spreader on top and


126
0:3:58,17 --> 0:3:59,238
sling crap out.


127
0:3:59,238 --> 0:4:0,639
Travis Taylor: Oh manure
spreader to sling crap,


128
0:4:0,639 --> 0:4:1,674
that'll be good.


129
0:4:1,674 --> 0:4:2,775
Well y'all go figure
out what y'all want to


130
0:4:2,775 --> 0:4:4,276
do to yours and we'll
figure out what we're


131
0:4:4,276 --> 0:4:5,244
gonna do to ours.


132
0:4:5,244 --> 0:4:7,246
We're gonna put
some stuff on ours.


133
0:4:7,246 --> 0:4:8,781
Michael: Uncle
Travis wants to use my


134
0:4:8,781 --> 0:4:10,316
old pickup truck,
Uncle Jessie,


135
0:4:10,316 --> 0:4:11,684
for his remote
control car.


136
0:4:11,684 --> 0:4:12,685
Pete: You know, I
should have brought


137
0:4:12,685 --> 0:4:14,119
a crowbar I bet.


138
0:4:14,119 --> 0:4:15,454
Michael: So if I'm
gonna fight him in a


139
0:4:15,454 --> 0:4:18,891
demolition derby I got
to go for a big gun.


140
0:4:18,891 --> 0:4:23,128
I might have
just the thing.


141
0:4:23,128 --> 0:4:25,931
Travis Taylor: Ah,
that ain't no weapon.


142
0:4:25,931 --> 0:4:27,8
He shows up
with this old RV


143
0:4:27,8 --> 0:4:29,201
that we've used
for stuff before.


144
0:4:29,201 --> 0:4:31,67
That thing's rickety,
it's rotten and rusty.


145
0:4:31,67 --> 0:4:35,207
There's no way it can
hold up to Uncle Jessie.


146
0:4:35,207 --> 0:4:37,543
And I'm telling you
David is gonna kick


147
0:4:37,543 --> 0:4:38,877
Goliath's butt.


148
0:4:38,877 --> 0:4:40,112
That thing's
just an accident


149
0:4:40,112 --> 0:4:41,18
waiting to happen.


150
0:4:41,18 --> 0:4:42,481
Michael: Exactly,
isn't that what you


151
0:4:42,481 --> 0:4:43,916
want in a
demolition derby?


152
0:4:43,916 --> 0:4:45,15
Travis Taylor: Yeah.


153
0:4:45,15 --> 0:4:46,585
Michael: I think that
thing's heavy enough.


154
0:4:46,585 --> 0:4:47,853
If it puts one
good lick on


155
0:4:47,853 --> 0:4:48,921
Uncle Jessie it'll
be over with.


156
0:4:48,921 --> 0:4:50,22
Travis Taylor: I don't
believe you could


157
0:4:50,22 --> 0:4:51,19
ever get a hit on
Uncle Jessie.


158
0:4:51,19 --> 0:4:52,424
Uncle Jessie is
driving around all


159
0:4:52,424 --> 0:4:53,425
over that thing.


160
0:4:53,425 --> 0:4:54,593
You ain't never gonna
lay a lick on him.


161
0:4:54,593 --> 0:4:55,561
Michael: Man,
you're crazy,


162
0:4:55,561 --> 0:4:56,662
that thing's
got a 360 in it.


163
0:4:56,662 --> 0:4:57,696
Travis Taylor:
It don't matter.


164
0:4:57,696 --> 0:4:59,231
You can drive fast
in a straight line but


165
0:4:59,231 --> 0:5:0,733
you ain't gonna
turn real sharp or


166
0:5:0,733 --> 0:5:1,9
it'll flip over on you.


167
0:5:1,9 --> 0:5:3,202
Michael: Hey quit that,
you're gonna tear


168
0:5:3,202 --> 0:5:4,269
something off of there.


169
0:5:4,269 --> 0:5:6,638
Travis Taylor: I ain't
gonna tear nothing up.


170
0:5:6,638 --> 0:5:8,307
Rog: I'm on
team Michael.


171
0:5:8,307 --> 0:5:11,276
This old RV ain't
fast, but it's big.


172
0:5:11,276 --> 0:5:13,946
It's gonna take a
lot to destroy this thing.


173
0:5:13,946 --> 0:5:15,614
Travis Taylor: Come on
lets RC these trucks up


174
0:5:15,614 --> 0:5:17,416
and lets go have
us some fun.


175
0:5:17,416 --> 0:5:19,885
Once we figured out what
we needed I sent Michael


176
0:5:19,885 --> 0:5:21,72
and Pete off to the RC
store to come back with


177
0:5:21,72 --> 0:5:24,623
whatever we needed
to RC up the car.


178
0:5:24,623 --> 0:5:27,159
And in the meantime
Daddy and I and Rog


179
0:5:27,159 --> 0:5:30,429
are getting the steering
wheel off of Uncle Jessie.


180
0:5:30,429 --> 0:5:31,63
Daddy: There you go.


181
0:5:31,63 --> 0:5:32,564
Rog: All right team.


182
0:5:32,564 --> 0:5:33,499
Travis Taylor:
There it is.


183
0:5:33,499 --> 0:5:34,366
Here, go put
that somewhere.


184
0:5:34,366 --> 0:5:35,601
Rog: Hold this, Curly.


185
0:5:35,601 --> 0:5:37,736
Travis Taylor:
You and your pig.


186
0:5:37,736 --> 0:5:38,737
I said somewhere;


187
0:5:38,737 --> 0:5:40,739
I didn't mean throw
it in the back.


188
0:5:40,739 --> 0:5:42,441
Rog: Like you got
particular about the


189
0:5:42,441 --> 0:5:43,742
back of this truck.


190
0:5:43,742 --> 0:5:45,21
Look at all the
crap in there.


191
0:5:45,21 --> 0:5:47,212
Travis Taylor: Go put
that guinea pig somewhere


192
0:5:47,212 --> 0:5:48,447
and do something.


193
0:5:48,447 --> 0:5:49,848
Y'all are gonna lose
'cause all you're gonna do


194
0:5:49,848 --> 0:5:51,817
is sit around and pet
that guinea pig all day.


195
0:5:51,817 --> 0:5:52,785
Rog: Y'all
don't be throwing


196
0:5:52,785 --> 0:5:53,652
nothing back here.


197
0:5:53,652 --> 0:5:54,787
Travis Taylor:
Don't throw it, ag.


198
0:5:54,787 --> 0:5:55,988
You the one already
that threw that


199
0:5:55,988 --> 0:5:57,89
steering wheel
in the back.


200
0:5:57,89 --> 0:5:58,69
Don't leave that pig in
the back of my truck.


201
0:5:58,69 --> 0:5:59,725
Rog: That ain't
your truck.


202
0:5:59,725 --> 0:6:0,959
Travis Taylor: Well
it's gonna be when I


203
0:6:0,959 --> 0:6:5,23
start putting
robot stuff on it.


204
0:6:5,23 --> 0:6:7,933
Rog: Stay with it Mule.


205
0:6:7,933 --> 0:6:9,268
Travis Taylor: We're
gonna steer the truck


206
0:6:9,268 --> 0:6:11,437
with the servomotors
connected to a pulley.


207
0:6:11,437 --> 0:6:13,405
So I'm welding the
pulley wheel directly


208
0:6:13,405 --> 0:6:15,607
to the steering column.


209
0:6:15,607 --> 0:6:17,309
After he got back
with the parts,


210
0:6:17,309 --> 0:6:19,344
Michael started building
the frames that'll hold


211
0:6:19,344 --> 0:6:22,948
the servomotors inside
both of the trucks.


212
0:6:22,948 --> 0:6:24,249
And these are the
parts that will make it


213
0:6:24,249 --> 0:6:27,519
push, pull and turn.


214
0:6:27,519 --> 0:6:29,288
A radio signal from
our control makes the


215
0:6:29,288 --> 0:6:31,79
actuators push the
hydraulic pistons,


216
0:6:31,79 --> 0:6:33,959
which are attached
to the pedals.


217
0:6:33,959 --> 0:6:36,261
Push one lever, the
gas pedal moves and


218
0:6:36,261 --> 0:6:37,629
the truck goes.


219
0:6:37,629 --> 0:6:39,498
Push another, the
brake pedal moves and


220
0:6:39,498 --> 0:6:42,801
the truck stops.


221
0:6:42,801 --> 0:6:45,904
Daddy, here's
something you can do.


222
0:6:45,904 --> 0:6:47,105
Daddy: What do you want?


223
0:6:47,105 --> 0:6:48,64
Travis Taylor: Go out
there and figure how that


224
0:6:48,64 --> 0:6:50,175
right there is gonna
go on like the bottom


225
0:6:50,175 --> 0:6:52,1
of the brake pedal
or the gas pedal.


226
0:6:52,1 --> 0:6:53,679
Daddy: Now I'm
gonna grind in that


227
0:6:53,679 --> 0:6:56,949
brake pedal down.


228
0:6:56,949 --> 0:6:58,617
Travis Taylor: While
you're grinding,


229
0:6:58,617 --> 0:6:59,885
look right here,
I didn't finish this


230
0:6:59,885 --> 0:7:0,919
I don't think.


231
0:7:0,919 --> 0:7:2,488
See if this one will
fit on there flat,


232
0:7:2,488 --> 0:7:4,156
we need to grind
that down some more.


233
0:7:4,156 --> 0:7:6,258
Rog: Y'all are doing all
this for naught really.


234
0:7:6,258 --> 0:7:7,259
Travis Taylor: Why?


235
0:7:7,259 --> 0:7:9,127
Rog: Oh, we're gonna
destroy y'all dude.


236
0:7:9,127 --> 0:7:10,195
Travis Taylor: Oh.


237
0:7:10,195 --> 0:7:11,763
Rog: That RV's gonna
roll right over on you.


238
0:7:11,763 --> 0:7:12,998
Travis Taylor: Y'all
aren't even gonna


239
0:7:12,998 --> 0:7:13,932
lay a hand on us.


240
0:7:13,932 --> 0:7:15,167
Rog: Whatever, we
ain't gonna use hands.


241
0:7:15,167 --> 0:7:16,101
Travis Taylor: Look here.


242
0:7:16,101 --> 0:7:17,369
Michael: Uncle Travis
better be ready


243
0:7:17,369 --> 0:7:19,171
because we got plans
for deadly weapons.


244
0:7:19,171 --> 0:7:20,906
We need to do is get a
piece of angle iron and


245
0:7:20,906 --> 0:7:23,41
take two opposite ones
across and drill them


246
0:7:23,41 --> 0:7:24,943
holes and then we
can just slide a piece


247
0:7:24,943 --> 0:7:26,378
of angle on there
and then we can weld


248
0:7:26,378 --> 0:7:29,147
all the pieces to the
one piece of angle.


249
0:7:29,147 --> 0:7:31,55
We're gonna put a rammer
on the front of the RV,


250
0:7:31,55 --> 0:7:33,519
we're gonna have
fireworks shooting out the


251
0:7:33,519 --> 0:7:35,354
sides to set the
enemy on fire.


252
0:7:35,354 --> 0:7:37,222
And we're gonna hang
big wrecking balls off


253
0:7:37,222 --> 0:7:39,925
each side to hit the
truck as we pass.


254
0:7:39,925 --> 0:7:41,727
We're gonna add spikes
to the wrecking balls


255
0:7:41,727 --> 0:7:43,562
so it's a big mace.


256
0:7:43,562 --> 0:7:47,432
We're gonna get
medieval on this truck.


257
0:7:47,432 --> 0:7:48,901
Travis Taylor: I was
thinking about how


258
0:7:48,901 --> 0:7:50,135
this crash-up
derby's gonna work.


259
0:7:50,135 --> 0:7:52,137
We can't go in reverse
so we're just gonna go


260
0:7:52,137 --> 0:7:54,139
around and around each
other just like an


261
0:7:54,139 --> 0:7:56,575
old pirate ship
navy battle.


262
0:7:56,575 --> 0:8:0,112
So I used that strategy
to design our weapon.


263
0:8:0,112 --> 0:8:1,58
I decided to have
Daddy make some


264
0:8:1,58 --> 0:8:4,516
pirate ship cannons
out of old sewer pipe.


265
0:8:4,516 --> 0:8:6,985
We're gonna mount them
on each side of the truck


266
0:8:6,985 --> 0:8:10,22
and they're gonna
fire beer cans.


267
0:8:10,22 --> 0:8:12,57
Daddy: Too much.


268
0:8:12,57 --> 0:8:14,393
Well now I've
seen everything.


269
0:8:14,393 --> 0:8:17,696
He's got me making a
homemade beer cannon.


270
0:8:17,696 --> 0:8:20,232
I did a little math and I
figured that with about


271
0:8:20,232 --> 0:8:23,368
10 grams of black powder
a 12-ounce beer can


272
0:8:23,368 --> 0:8:26,405
should go just
about 200 feet.


273
0:8:26,405 --> 0:8:27,606
Travis Taylor: This
thing's loaded.


274
0:8:27,606 --> 0:8:28,807
Here's our beer cannon,


275
0:8:28,807 --> 0:8:29,975
let's go see
if it'll work.


276
0:8:29,975 --> 0:8:31,41
Well let me point
that somewhere else,


277
0:8:31,41 --> 0:8:32,945
Daddy, yeah.


278
0:8:32,945 --> 0:8:34,813
All right,
here we go.


279
0:8:34,813 --> 0:8:35,981
Daddy: I'll be
surprised if that


280
0:8:35,981 --> 0:8:37,616
beer can don't rupture.


281
0:8:37,616 --> 0:8:38,784
Travis Taylor:
Yeah we might just


282
0:8:38,784 --> 0:8:40,252
throw beer everywhere.


283
0:8:40,252 --> 0:8:43,221
We got about 10 grams
of gunpowder in this


284
0:8:43,221 --> 0:8:46,892
thing loaded with a full
12-ounce can of beer.


285
0:8:46,892 --> 0:8:49,161
If we're right it's gonna
act like a cannon ball


286
0:8:49,161 --> 0:8:51,33
and blow a hole right
through our enemy.


287
0:8:51,33 --> 0:8:53,298
If we're wrong, well
we may just be covered


288
0:8:53,298 --> 0:8:56,234
with beer and blood
from the shrapnel.


289
0:8:56,234 --> 0:8:57,703
Get on back there
behind an oak tree


290
0:8:57,703 --> 0:8:58,704
or something.


291
0:8:58,704 --> 0:8:59,705
Pete: Yeah.


292
0:8:59,705 --> 0:9:1,73
Travis Taylor: We have
to very carefully


293
0:9:1,73 --> 0:9:3,8
wire the beer cannon
into its trigger,


294
0:9:3,8 --> 0:9:4,409
a 12-volt battery.


295
0:9:4,409 --> 0:9:7,98
We're doing it from a good
distance just to be safe.


296
0:9:7,98 --> 0:9:9,114
Everybody fire
in the hole,


297
0:9:9,114 --> 0:9:10,15
fire in the hole.


298
0:9:10,15 --> 0:9:10,983
Here we go.


299
0:9:10,983 --> 0:9:16,254
And three, two, one.


300
0:9:16,254 --> 0:9:21,727
Holy crap!


301
0:9:21,727 --> 0:9:22,928
Travis Taylor: We're
putting remote control


302
0:9:22,928 --> 0:9:27,599
devices on an old
pickup and an RV.


303
0:9:27,599 --> 0:9:30,535
Plus we're adding some
serious weapons here


304
0:9:30,535 --> 0:9:32,904
because they're going
head to head in an RC


305
0:9:32,904 --> 0:9:34,773
demolition derby.


306
0:9:34,773 --> 0:9:36,341
Fire in the hole,
fire in the hole.


307
0:9:36,341 --> 0:9:37,342
Here we go.


308
0:9:37,342 --> 0:9:38,777
We're adding a beer
can cannon to the


309
0:9:38,777 --> 0:9:41,313
pickup but first we
had to test it.


310
0:9:41,313 --> 0:9:47,586
Three, two, one.


311
0:9:47,586 --> 0:9:50,455
Holy crap.


312
0:9:50,455 --> 0:9:51,356
Pete: Whoa.


313
0:9:51,356 --> 0:9:52,257
Where'd it go to?


314
0:9:52,257 --> 0:9:53,258
Travis Taylor: It
went way out there.


315
0:9:53,258 --> 0:9:54,226
Pete: Yeah.


316
0:9:54,226 --> 0:9:55,26
Travis Taylor: It
went 100 yards.


317
0:9:55,26 --> 0:9:56,328
Pete: That was
beautiful.


318
0:9:56,328 --> 0:9:57,529
Travis Taylor: I'm
walking that off.


319
0:9:57,529 --> 0:10:0,98
Daddy: Well I
said 200 feet.


320
0:10:0,98 --> 0:10:1,633
Travis Taylor: 72 yards.


321
0:10:1,633 --> 0:10:3,869
That's 216 feet.


322
0:10:3,869 --> 0:10:5,937
Pete: On the
nose, Charlie.


323
0:10:5,937 --> 0:10:7,305
Daddy: What's
it look like?


324
0:10:7,305 --> 0:10:8,473
Travis Taylor: Just
ripped the bottom off


325
0:10:8,473 --> 0:10:9,708
of it when it
hit the ground.


326
0:10:9,708 --> 0:10:10,809
Daddy: I'll be darned.


327
0:10:10,809 --> 0:10:12,44
Travis Taylor:
Daddy you can build


328
0:10:12,44 --> 0:10:13,178
the hell out
of a cannon.


329
0:10:13,178 --> 0:10:15,147
Daddy: Shoot beer at 'em,
when all else fails.


330
0:10:15,147 --> 0:10:17,683
Pete: That's awesome.


331
0:10:17,683 --> 0:10:19,17
Travis Taylor: We're
also adding to our


332
0:10:19,17 --> 0:10:21,319
arsenal with old-school
battering rams and


333
0:10:21,319 --> 0:10:23,889
axe blades off
the side of the truck.


334
0:10:23,889 --> 0:10:25,724
This looks, it's nasty.


335
0:10:25,724 --> 0:10:28,527
All right, so put that
right there for a minute.


336
0:10:28,527 --> 0:10:30,429
Now that's got to
get mounted somehow


337
0:10:30,429 --> 0:10:31,997
to that seat change.


338
0:10:31,997 --> 0:10:33,65
Pete: Here's what
I was thinking.


339
0:10:33,65 --> 0:10:35,133
Travis Taylor: Look this
we weld it out here.


340
0:10:35,133 --> 0:10:37,703
Pete: I like that.


341
0:10:37,703 --> 0:10:38,837
Michael: I stole
an idea from that


342
0:10:38,837 --> 0:10:40,238
old movie,<i> Ben-Hur</i> .


343
0:10:40,238 --> 0:10:42,941
We're gonna weld spikes
sticking out of the tires.


344
0:10:42,941 --> 0:10:44,643
If that truck comes
anywhere near us,


345
0:10:44,643 --> 0:10:48,914
we're gonna rip its
tires to shreds.


346
0:10:48,914 --> 0:10:50,48
Travis Taylor:
What are you doing?


347
0:10:50,48 --> 0:10:51,316
Rog: Got me a secret
weapon right here.


348
0:10:51,316 --> 0:10:53,552
We ain't gonna
need that big one.


349
0:10:53,552 --> 0:10:55,554
Curly now he's mad
'cause y'all made fun


350
0:10:55,554 --> 0:10:58,39
of him a while ago.


351
0:10:58,39 --> 0:11:0,192
Tell 'em Curly.


352
0:11:0,192 --> 0:11:3,395
Daddy:<i> [laughing].</i>


353
0:11:3,395 --> 0:11:4,663
Travis Taylor: He
needs him a girlfriend


354
0:11:4,663 --> 0:11:6,431
he can put in there
and ride her around.


355
0:11:6,431 --> 0:11:7,432
Rog: He's looking;


356
0:11:7,432 --> 0:11:9,34
he's out cruising looking
for a girlfriend.


357
0:11:9,34 --> 0:11:10,35
Travis Taylor: Yeah.


358
0:11:10,35 --> 0:11:11,169
Daddy: Yeah, I don't
think anything that


359
0:11:11,169 --> 0:11:12,504
ugly could get
a girlfriend.


360
0:11:12,504 --> 0:11:13,839
Travis Taylor: Well
except maybe another


361
0:11:13,839 --> 0:11:15,507
hairless,
ugly girlfriend.


362
0:11:15,507 --> 0:11:16,641
Rog: Remember that
girlfriend you


363
0:11:16,641 --> 0:11:17,743
had in high school?


364
0:11:17,743 --> 0:11:19,211
Travis Taylor:
Shut up, Rog.


365
0:11:19,211 --> 0:11:20,145
Rog: Look at old Curly.


366
0:11:20,145 --> 0:11:21,346
Travis Taylor: Just
keep on playing


367
0:11:21,346 --> 0:11:22,414
with your hairless rat.


368
0:11:22,414 --> 0:11:24,282
You'll see who's gonna
end up being victorious


369
0:11:24,282 --> 0:11:25,684
when all said and done.


370
0:11:25,684 --> 0:11:27,52
Rog: Can't
believe you got.


371
0:11:27,52 --> 0:11:28,82
Travis Taylor: If I were
you I'd get back to work.


372
0:11:28,82 --> 0:11:33,825
Daddy: Get out
of here, pig.


373
0:11:33,825 --> 0:11:36,61
Travis Taylor: We got
our weapons lined up


374
0:11:36,61 --> 0:11:37,529
but Michael is the
only one of us who


375
0:11:37,529 --> 0:11:39,831
has experience with
remote control.


376
0:11:39,831 --> 0:11:42,467
So we are relying on him
to set up the RC units


377
0:11:42,467 --> 0:11:44,536
for both trucks and
we're getting close


378
0:11:44,536 --> 0:11:45,937
to our first test.


379
0:11:45,937 --> 0:11:46,938
Michael: We've
about got everything


380
0:11:46,938 --> 0:11:48,24
wired up in here.


381
0:11:48,24 --> 0:11:50,41
I've wired it all
to this controller.


382
0:11:50,41 --> 0:11:53,612
I can steer it.


383
0:11:53,612 --> 0:11:57,215
I got my brakes.


384
0:11:57,215 --> 0:12:2,354
And then, I've even
got my throttle.


385
0:12:2,354 --> 0:12:4,89
Travis Taylor: We've
got both the vehicles


386
0:12:4,89 --> 0:12:6,958
completely remote
control ready.


387
0:12:6,958 --> 0:12:8,293
Now we need to test
those things and


388
0:12:8,293 --> 0:12:9,795
make sure
that it works.


389
0:12:9,795 --> 0:12:12,3
So we stripped the
weapons off Uncle Jessie


390
0:12:12,3 --> 0:12:13,565
and got it
ready to roll.


391
0:12:13,565 --> 0:12:15,467
Come here we're gonna
do a test on this thing.


392
0:12:15,467 --> 0:12:16,802
Michael: Hey Rog, why
don't you ride and


393
0:12:16,802 --> 0:12:17,769
be my gear shifter.


394
0:12:17,769 --> 0:12:18,637
Rog: I'll do it.


395
0:12:18,637 --> 0:12:19,504
Travis Taylor: All
right here we go.


396
0:12:19,504 --> 0:12:20,372
Back it up, Michael.


397
0:12:20,372 --> 0:12:21,473
Pete: Are we still in?


398
0:12:21,473 --> 0:12:22,44
Daddy: I hope
it backs up.


399
0:12:22,44 --> 0:12:23,542
Travis Taylor: Put
the car in reverse.


400
0:12:23,542 --> 0:12:24,81
Rog: I guess we could
have figured out how


401
0:12:24,81 --> 0:12:26,578
to put it into
reverse remotely,


402
0:12:26,578 --> 0:12:27,646
but that would
have been a lot


403
0:12:27,646 --> 0:12:30,15
more work, so we
decided against it.


404
0:12:30,15 --> 0:12:33,251
Travis Taylor: Put it
in drive and get out.


405
0:12:33,251 --> 0:12:35,72
Here we go.


406
0:12:35,72 --> 0:12:38,456
Watch out, Daddy, he
might run over you.


407
0:12:38,456 --> 0:12:40,91
We're going
around that tree.


408
0:12:40,91 --> 0:12:41,56
Pete: This
is pretty cool.


409
0:12:41,56 --> 0:12:44,462
Rog: Look at that,
Uncle Jesse, son.


410
0:12:44,462 --> 0:12:45,53
Pete: This
is pretty neat,


411
0:12:45,53 --> 0:12:46,565
there's a truck driving


412
0:12:46,565 --> 0:12:48,567
around the yard
with nobody in it.


413
0:12:48,567 --> 0:12:50,602
And here we are with
a toy remote control,


414
0:12:50,602 --> 0:12:52,47
making it go
wherever we want.


415
0:12:52,47 --> 0:12:53,872
It's like the best
Christmas present


416
0:12:53,872 --> 0:12:58,944
a man could ever want.


417
0:12:58,944 --> 0:13:1,112
Daddy: Michael,
quit ruining my yard.


418
0:13:1,112 --> 0:13:2,581
Rog:<i> [laughing].</i>


419
0:13:2,581 --> 0:13:6,785
He's on it, Charlie.


420
0:13:6,785 --> 0:13:7,552
Michael: Watch this;


421
0:13:7,552 --> 0:13:9,87
see if I can
power brake it.


422
0:13:9,87 --> 0:13:10,522
Daddy: He comes
running across the yard


423
0:13:10,522 --> 0:13:14,826
with tires spinning and dug
a trench across my grass.


424
0:13:14,826 --> 0:13:16,127
Michael: Well you
can power brake.


425
0:13:16,127 --> 0:13:18,96
That ain't the
yard out there.


426
0:13:18,96 --> 0:13:19,564
Daddy: I'm skinning
that boy's head


427
0:13:19,564 --> 0:13:21,199
before this day is over.


428
0:13:21,199 --> 0:13:23,134
Rog: Oh me, Michael's
gonna get a whooping.


429
0:13:23,134 --> 0:13:24,336
Travis Taylor: Oh,
grandma's gonna be


430
0:13:24,336 --> 0:13:25,937
madder than
crap about that.


431
0:13:25,937 --> 0:13:27,38
Michael: I was forced
to hand over the


432
0:13:27,38 --> 0:13:28,673
controls to
Pete after that.


433
0:13:28,673 --> 0:13:31,343
Pete: Charlie, I will not
power brake in your yard.


434
0:13:31,343 --> 0:13:33,345
Travis Taylor: Turn it.


435
0:13:33,345 --> 0:13:34,512
Turn it.


436
0:13:34,512 --> 0:13:35,547
Pete: Oh, hold on.


437
0:13:35,547 --> 0:13:36,581
Rog: Go fast, Pete.


438
0:13:36,581 --> 0:13:38,817
Travis Taylor: Turn
it, Pete, turn it.


439
0:13:38,817 --> 0:13:40,151
You got to turn it, boy.


440
0:13:40,151 --> 0:13:41,953
Pete: I know.


441
0:13:41,953 --> 0:13:43,488
Travis Taylor: Now you
done got it stuck.


442
0:13:43,488 --> 0:13:45,79
Pete: No I didn't.


443
0:13:45,79 --> 0:13:47,325
Travis Taylor: Turn it
back, bring it back.


444
0:13:47,325 --> 0:13:49,461
Bring it back.


445
0:13:49,461 --> 0:13:50,862
Rog: You got to turn
it while it's going


446
0:13:50,862 --> 0:13:51,83
or it's hard to do.


447
0:13:51,83 --> 0:13:52,797
Michael: Yeah, turn
it while it's going,


448
0:13:52,797 --> 0:13:54,65
it's holding
up right there.


449
0:13:54,65 --> 0:13:55,133
Travis Taylor: Come on.


450
0:13:55,133 --> 0:13:56,34
How long is that range,
that thing's got?


451
0:13:56,34 --> 0:13:57,35
Michael: Oh it's
got a long range.


452
0:13:57,35 --> 0:13:58,203
Don't worry
about your range.


453
0:13:58,203 --> 0:13:59,437
Travis Taylor:
Turn it around.


454
0:13:59,437 --> 0:14:0,472
Rog: It's
running in circles.


455
0:14:0,472 --> 0:14:2,7
Pete: It takes a little
getting used to.


456
0:14:2,7 --> 0:14:3,408
Almost cut a
donut with it.


457
0:14:3,408 --> 0:14:4,643
Michael: Do it.


458
0:14:4,643 --> 0:14:6,611
Travis Taylor: No,
not out in the field.


459
0:14:6,611 --> 0:14:7,445
Come on.


460
0:14:7,445 --> 0:14:8,613
Daddy: I do not
want donuts cut.


461
0:14:8,613 --> 0:14:9,748
I am serious.


462
0:14:9,748 --> 0:14:10,849
Pete: Whoa, whoa, whoa.


463
0:14:10,849 --> 0:14:11,883
Travis Taylor: Pete.


464
0:14:11,883 --> 0:14:12,984
Watch out, now.


465
0:14:12,984 --> 0:14:14,753
Be careful,
don't get going too fast.


466
0:14:14,753 --> 0:14:15,887
Pete: Wait a minute.


467
0:14:15,887 --> 0:14:16,955
Oh.


468
0:14:16,955 --> 0:14:19,424
Something's wr.


469
0:14:19,424 --> 0:14:20,592
Travis Taylor:
What are you doing?


470
0:14:20,592 --> 0:14:22,193
Ho, stop it, Pete.


471
0:14:22,193 --> 0:14:23,61
Pete: It won't.


472
0:14:23,61 --> 0:14:24,562
Travis Taylor: Crap.


473
0:14:24,562 --> 0:14:26,131
Oh, turn it off.


474
0:14:26,131 --> 0:14:27,232
Turn it off.


475
0:14:27,232 --> 0:14:29,434
Pete: I couldn't hit the
breaks or the steering.


476
0:14:29,434 --> 0:14:32,17
I guess we lost
the signal.


477
0:14:32,17 --> 0:14:33,238
Travis Taylor: Crap.


478
0:14:33,238 --> 0:14:35,14
Michael: Oh good idea,
now the radiator's blown.


479
0:14:35,14 --> 0:14:35,974
Travis Taylor: Is it?


480
0:14:35,974 --> 0:14:36,942
Michael: Yeah.


481
0:14:36,942 --> 0:14:38,443
Daddy: This
truck's wrecked.


482
0:14:38,443 --> 0:14:40,879
We got a limb big as a
baseball bat sticking


483
0:14:40,879 --> 0:14:43,181
through the radiator.


484
0:14:43,181 --> 0:14:44,549
Travis Taylor: Crap.


485
0:14:44,549 --> 0:14:46,17
Michael: The
truck is toast.


486
0:14:46,17 --> 0:14:48,42
We spent the whole day
putting the RC unit on it,


487
0:14:48,42 --> 0:14:52,57
then it goes out of
control and crashes.


488
0:14:52,57 --> 0:14:55,36
The radiator's destroyed,
water's pouring everywhere


489
0:14:55,36 --> 0:14:57,495
and it's already
overheating.


490
0:14:57,495 --> 0:14:59,998
Travis Taylor:
See if it'll go.


491
0:14:59,998 --> 0:15:2,968
It'll run, 'til
it runs hot.


492
0:15:2,968 --> 0:15:8,73
Michael: This won't go
more than 40 feet now.


493
0:15:8,73 --> 0:15:9,274
Rog: Stay with it, Pete.


494
0:15:9,274 --> 0:15:10,475
Travis Taylor: We
always have to test


495
0:15:10,475 --> 0:15:11,543
the things that we build.


496
0:15:11,543 --> 0:15:14,79
But I hate it when tests
go wrong and tear up what


497
0:15:14,79 --> 0:15:16,648
we just spent all
day working on.


498
0:15:16,648 --> 0:15:18,383
So we got to get
our act together.


499
0:15:18,383 --> 0:15:20,652
And to be honest I don't
know if we can fix this


500
0:15:20,652 --> 0:15:23,788
radiator or even find
a new one overnight.


501
0:15:23,788 --> 0:15:29,194
If we don't,
we're screwed.


502
0:15:29,194 --> 0:15:31,296
Daddy: These
experiments are dangerous.


503
0:15:31,296 --> 0:15:33,398
These guys are real
rocket scientists.


504
0:15:33,398 --> 0:15:37,869
Don't try this at home.


505
0:15:37,869 --> 0:15:38,703
Rog: Oh hell.


506
0:15:38,703 --> 0:15:39,704
Travis Taylor:
Michael what the.


507
0:15:39,704 --> 0:15:40,739
Rog: Hang on.


508
0:15:40,739 --> 0:15:42,407
Travis Taylor: We're
taking full-sized trucks


509
0:15:42,407 --> 0:15:44,42
and making them
remote controlled.


510
0:15:44,42 --> 0:15:45,677
Be careful, don't
be going too fast.


511
0:15:45,677 --> 0:15:48,58
Our first test
was a disaster.


512
0:15:48,58 --> 0:15:49,547
Crap.


513
0:15:49,547 --> 0:15:54,252
Oh, stop it.


514
0:15:54,252 --> 0:15:56,688
Michael: Oh good idea,
now the radiator's blown.


515
0:15:56,688 --> 0:15:57,489
Travis Taylor: Is it?


516
0:15:57,489 --> 0:15:58,623
Michael: Yeah.


517
0:15:58,623 --> 0:16:0,225
Travis Taylor: We spent
the night calling around


518
0:16:0,225 --> 0:16:3,628
auto stores and junkyards
and by a miracle Pete


519
0:16:3,628 --> 0:16:6,765
found a Ford radiator that
would just about fit.


520
0:16:6,765 --> 0:16:8,7
So we worked on
getting it in place,


521
0:16:8,7 --> 0:16:10,769
fixing it to where
the truck could run.


522
0:16:10,769 --> 0:16:13,838
And I think we're
back in business.


523
0:16:13,838 --> 0:16:15,673
Michael: So now both
trucks are ready and


524
0:16:15,673 --> 0:16:19,344
it's time to rumble.


525
0:16:19,344 --> 0:16:20,612
Daddy: We're at
the Fairgrounds,


526
0:16:20,612 --> 0:16:23,181
where they'll let us
use their big field.


527
0:16:23,181 --> 0:16:25,216
We've got two vehicles
and they're each armed


528
0:16:25,216 --> 0:16:28,86
to the teeth and
remote controlled.


529
0:16:28,86 --> 0:16:29,654
These boys are planning
to crash them into


530
0:16:29,654 --> 0:16:32,157
each other over
and over again until


531
0:16:32,157 --> 0:16:34,292
they're
completely destroyed.


532
0:16:34,292 --> 0:16:38,63
In Alabama we call
that a great weekend.


533
0:16:38,63 --> 0:16:39,364
Travis Taylor: We're
gonna knock that RV


534
0:16:39,364 --> 0:16:40,432
right off the road.


535
0:16:40,432 --> 0:16:42,901
We've made our old
truck Uncle Jesse into a


536
0:16:42,901 --> 0:16:45,36
deadly remote
control weapon.


537
0:16:45,36 --> 0:16:46,237
This thing right here
is gonna be like a


538
0:16:46,237 --> 0:16:48,106
can opener, it's
gonna rip that RV


539
0:16:48,106 --> 0:16:50,41
of yours just
right in two.


540
0:16:50,41 --> 0:16:51,609
Pete: That's right,
stem to stern.


541
0:16:51,609 --> 0:16:52,944
Travis Taylor: We're
gonna use these saw blades


542
0:16:52,944 --> 0:16:54,446
to cut your wheels
out from under you.


543
0:16:54,446 --> 0:16:55,947
The thing that's gonna
really take you out,


544
0:16:55,947 --> 0:16:57,449
these beer cans are
gonna go right through


545
0:16:57,449 --> 0:16:58,817
the walls of that thing.


546
0:16:58,817 --> 0:17:0,318
Michael: Shoot, that
ain't gonna do nothing.


547
0:17:0,318 --> 0:17:1,419
Travis Taylor:
They are too.


548
0:17:1,419 --> 0:17:2,587
Michael: Uncle Travis
and Pete might have


549
0:17:2,587 --> 0:17:4,289
beer cannons
but Rog and I


550
0:17:4,289 --> 0:17:7,759
got old fashion
wrecking balls.


551
0:17:7,759 --> 0:17:9,627
We got heavy kegs with
spikes hanging from


552
0:17:9,627 --> 0:17:11,93
each side and spinning
spikes coming out


553
0:17:11,93 --> 0:17:13,498
of each wheel.


554
0:17:13,498 --> 0:17:15,66
We also have fireworks.


555
0:17:15,66 --> 0:17:16,868
There's a whole box of
bottle rockets and


556
0:17:16,868 --> 0:17:19,37
Roman Candles pointing
out of the side of the RV.


557
0:17:19,37 --> 0:17:20,738
We're gonna
shoot em out and set


558
0:17:20,738 --> 0:17:22,407
Uncle Jessie on fire.


559
0:17:22,407 --> 0:17:23,374
Travis Taylor:
Rocket launchers?


560
0:17:23,374 --> 0:17:24,342
Michael: Yeah.


561
0:17:24,342 --> 0:17:25,477
Travis Taylor: Rockets
are just gonna go


562
0:17:25,477 --> 0:17:26,311
off across the
parking lot.


563
0:17:26,311 --> 0:17:27,45
Michael: Yeah.


564
0:17:27,45 --> 0:17:28,46
Yeah, right.


565
0:17:28,46 --> 0:17:28,98
Travis Taylor: You ain't
gonna hit nothing.


566
0:17:28,98 --> 0:17:29,681
Michael: They're
gonna go right through


567
0:17:29,681 --> 0:17:30,615
the windshield.


568
0:17:30,615 --> 0:17:31,616
Travis Taylor:
Especially if you keep


569
0:17:31,616 --> 0:17:32,45
them duct taped
down like that.


570
0:17:32,45 --> 0:17:33,384
Michael: Yeah.


571
0:17:33,384 --> 0:17:34,252
Travis Taylor:
You're just gonna set


572
0:17:34,252 --> 0:17:35,22
yourself on fire.


573
0:17:35,22 --> 0:17:36,521
Michael: Most
of all we've got weight


574
0:17:36,521 --> 0:17:37,622
and speed.


575
0:17:37,622 --> 0:17:40,58
We could ram that little
truck and that'd be it.


576
0:17:40,58 --> 0:17:42,327
Daddy: I told these boys
to take some test runs


577
0:17:42,327 --> 0:17:44,95
before we start the
demolition derby.


578
0:17:44,95 --> 0:17:46,3
Travis Taylor: Go
around and around, man.


579
0:17:46,3 --> 0:17:47,198
Daddy: I want
to make sure we can


580
0:17:47,198 --> 0:17:48,166
control these things.


581
0:17:48,166 --> 0:17:49,367
Travis Taylor:
Go, Pete, go.


582
0:17:49,367 --> 0:17:50,335
Rog: Look at that.


583
0:17:50,335 --> 0:17:51,936
<i> [laughing].</i>


584
0:17:51,936 --> 0:17:53,338
That sucker gets
sideways, Charlie.


585
0:17:53,338 --> 0:17:54,506
Travis Taylor: Go a
little faster, Pete.


586
0:17:54,506 --> 0:17:55,54
Michael: This
thing is deadly.


587
0:17:55,54 --> 0:17:56,808
I didn't realize what
kind of momentum those


588
0:17:56,808 --> 0:17:59,377
kegs would pick up just
swinging on the sides.


589
0:17:59,377 --> 0:18:3,181
One hit from that and
Uncle Jessie is gone.


590
0:18:3,181 --> 0:18:4,782
Rog: Watch that
brush by, Pete.


591
0:18:4,782 --> 0:18:5,917
Travis Taylor: These
guys don't know about


592
0:18:5,917 --> 0:18:7,585
my secret weapon.


593
0:18:7,585 --> 0:18:9,687
It's a little remote
control toy car.


594
0:18:9,687 --> 0:18:11,256
And it's carrying
a fireworks bomb


595
0:18:11,256 --> 0:18:12,824
on its back.


596
0:18:12,824 --> 0:18:15,226
When I need to, I
can have that thing drive


597
0:18:15,226 --> 0:18:18,53
right under the RV and
blow it up from underneath.


598
0:18:18,53 --> 0:18:21,232
It's a remote
control assassin.


599
0:18:21,232 --> 0:18:22,6
Daddy: I'm ready
to see some action.


600
0:18:22,6 --> 0:18:23,368
Travis Taylor:
Let's do it.


601
0:18:23,368 --> 0:18:24,135
Daddy: Let's do it.


602
0:18:24,135 --> 0:18:25,336
Get out here
and let's go.


603
0:18:25,336 --> 0:18:26,504
Travis Taylor:
Let's get it on.


604
0:18:26,504 --> 0:18:27,372
Michael: All right.


605
0:18:27,372 --> 0:18:28,373
Travis Taylor:
It's show time,


606
0:18:28,373 --> 0:18:29,774
it's the David and
Goliath battle royale and


607
0:18:29,774 --> 0:18:31,576
David is about to
kick Goliath's butt.


608
0:18:31,576 --> 0:18:35,413
Daddy: Get
ready, set, go.


609
0:18:35,413 --> 0:18:37,682
Travis Taylor: Get him,
Pete, get him, Pete.


610
0:18:37,682 --> 0:18:47,926
Wait slow down.


611
0:18:47,926 --> 0:18:55,6
All right,
ripped him out.


612
0:18:55,6 --> 0:18:57,202
Rog: Look at the
side of the RV.


613
0:18:57,202 --> 0:18:59,37
Travis Taylor:
We gutted the RV.


614
0:18:59,37 --> 0:19:2,6
First hit, Uncle Jessie
suffers no damage and


615
0:19:2,6 --> 0:19:5,61
we rip a big chunk
out of that RV.


616
0:19:5,61 --> 0:19:7,812
Pete: Oh look at all that
stuff on the ground.


617
0:19:7,812 --> 0:19:8,713
Michael:
That's all right,


618
0:19:8,713 --> 0:19:9,881
we got a big
vehicle and


619
0:19:9,881 --> 0:19:12,283
we can take a lot
of punishment.


620
0:19:12,283 --> 0:19:13,451
Rog: It looks like
we're gonna have to


621
0:19:13,451 --> 0:19:17,589
hit that truck
a lot harder.


622
0:19:17,589 --> 0:19:18,79
Travis Taylor: Bring
her around again,


623
0:19:18,79 --> 0:19:19,924
Pete, quick.


624
0:19:19,924 --> 0:19:20,892
Get him on this side.


625
0:19:20,892 --> 0:19:22,427
I think it's
about time for a


626
0:19:22,427 --> 0:19:24,963
pirate
cannon broadside.


627
0:19:24,963 --> 0:19:26,3
I'm gonna hit
him with the gun.


628
0:19:26,3 --> 0:19:27,131
Daddy: Get it, Pete.


629
0:19:27,131 --> 0:19:32,47
Rog: You can't hit
nothing, Mule.


630
0:19:32,47 --> 0:19:34,38
Pete: Hey, all right.


631
0:19:34,38 --> 0:19:36,874
Travis Taylor: Boom, score
one for the beer cannon.


632
0:19:36,874 --> 0:19:37,775
Pete: Woo.


633
0:19:37,775 --> 0:19:38,843
Travis Taylor:
Yeah, look at that.


634
0:19:38,843 --> 0:19:39,811
Rog: That was nothing.


635
0:19:39,811 --> 0:19:43,715
We took a direct hit
from the cannon and


636
0:19:43,715 --> 0:19:45,75
it didn't do
a damn thing.


637
0:19:45,75 --> 0:19:47,685
We're still in
this fight.


638
0:19:47,685 --> 0:19:49,153
Pete, you can't
catch nothing.


639
0:19:49,153 --> 0:19:51,889
Travis Taylor:
Get him, Pete.


640
0:19:51,889 --> 0:19:53,758
Daddy: Oh Pete,
you missed him.


641
0:19:53,758 --> 0:19:55,693
Travis Taylor:
Get him, Pete.


642
0:19:55,693 --> 0:20:1,266
There you go,
watch out, Pete.


643
0:20:1,266 --> 0:20:3,134
Whoa.


644
0:20:3,134 --> 0:20:5,136
Michael: Oh.


645
0:20:5,136 --> 0:20:15,68
Travis Taylor: Oh.


646
0:20:15,68 --> 0:20:17,148
Rog:<i> [laughing].</i>


647
0:20:17,148 --> 0:20:21,686
We've got hit hard,
but Uncle Jessie was


648
0:20:21,686 --> 0:20:24,389
spewing gas everywhere.


649
0:20:24,389 --> 0:20:26,257
All we need is
one good hit and


650
0:20:26,257 --> 0:20:28,626
we gonna take him
right out of the game.


651
0:20:28,626 --> 0:20:32,897
Daddy: You're gonna
run out of gas, Pete.


652
0:20:32,897 --> 0:20:36,968
Spewing gas everywhere.


653
0:20:36,968 --> 0:20:38,603
Look out.


654
0:20:38,603 --> 0:20:40,738
Pete: Get him.


655
0:20:40,738 --> 0:20:50,548
Travis Taylor: Oh.


656
0:20:50,548 --> 0:20:52,83
<i> [laughing].</i>


657
0:20:52,83 --> 0:20:55,119
Rog:<i> [laughing].</i>


658
0:20:55,119 --> 0:20:59,223
Oh get him,
boom, got it.


659
0:20:59,223 --> 0:21:0,525
<i> [laughing]</i>


660
0:21:0,525 --> 0:21:1,726
Come on, yurk.


661
0:21:1,726 --> 0:21:3,27
Travis Taylor: Whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,


662
0:21:3,27 --> 0:21:4,162
we're leaking
gas everywhere.


663
0:21:4,162 --> 0:21:5,396
Pete: Oh no, man.


664
0:21:5,396 --> 0:21:6,664
Travis Taylor: Be
careful, be careful.


665
0:21:6,664 --> 0:21:7,832
Rog:<i> [laughing].</i>


666
0:21:7,832 --> 0:21:8,766
Oh.


667
0:21:8,766 --> 0:21:9,701
Pete: God.


668
0:21:9,701 --> 0:21:10,902
Rog: I love it.


669
0:21:10,902 --> 0:21:12,17
Travis Taylor: Looks
like we're both dead


670
0:21:12,17 --> 0:21:13,304
in the water.


671
0:21:13,304 --> 0:21:17,642
But I've still got my
remote control assassin.


672
0:21:17,642 --> 0:21:21,779
There it goes.


673
0:21:21,779 --> 0:21:23,481
All right, here we go.


674
0:21:23,481 --> 0:21:28,986
Pete: At least gonna get
rid of the evidence.


675
0:21:28,986 --> 0:21:32,523
Rog: Woo.


676
0:21:32,523 --> 0:21:34,525
First the fireworks
started taking off.


677
0:21:34,525 --> 0:21:36,461
Put your safety
glasses on.


678
0:21:36,461 --> 0:21:39,43
Then they hit
the gasoline.


679
0:21:39,43 --> 0:21:41,566
Daddy: Uncle Jessie
was a good old truck.


680
0:21:41,566 --> 0:21:42,633
Travis Taylor:
Uncle Jessie was a


681
0:21:42,633 --> 0:21:45,169
good old truck.


682
0:21:45,169 --> 0:21:46,137
Rog: Oh.


683
0:21:46,137 --> 0:21:51,309
Michael: Get, get back.


684
0:21:51,309 --> 0:21:52,51
Travis Taylor: You
didn't leave Curly


685
0:21:52,51 --> 0:21:53,311
in there, did you?


686
0:21:53,311 --> 0:21:54,278
Rog: No, no, no.


687
0:21:54,278 --> 0:21:56,8
Curly's at home, safe.


688
0:21:56,8 --> 0:21:58,383
Travis Taylor: We proved
that in a weekend we could


689
0:21:58,383 --> 0:22:2,53
not only create a radio
controlled full-size car,


690
0:22:2,53 --> 0:22:5,556
but we could destroy that
thing real good too.


691
0:22:5,556 --> 0:22:13,898
Now that's redneck
ingenuity.


692
0:22:13,898 --> 0:22:20,271
Rog: It's time
to go, boy.


693
0:22:20,271 --> 0:22:22,807
Curly, come on, dude.


694
0:22:22,807 --> 0:22:25,276
Oh crap.


695
0:22:25,276 --> 0:22:27,578
Mamma: What are you
looking for, Rog?


696
0:22:27,578 --> 0:22:29,8
Rog: Uh, oh.


697
0:22:29,8 --> 0:22:30,114
<i> [laughing].</i>


698
0:22:30,114 --> 0:22:31,716
I sent Curly in
here to cool down.


699
0:22:31,716 --> 0:22:33,17
Come here, Curly.


700
0:22:33,17 --> 0:22:34,585
He don't come
when he's called.


701
0:22:34,585 --> 0:22:36,287
Mamma: Well what you
calling him for?


702
0:22:36,287 --> 0:24:36,287
Rog: I don't know, I
ain't never lost him.
