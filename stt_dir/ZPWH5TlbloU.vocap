###35 The American Dream
###37 There's a reason they call it a dream.
###41 Who's there?
###42 Cock-a-doodle-do pal.
###45 *Foreclosed*
###48 No, no, no!
###51 I don't have any more money!
###52 My job sucks right now. Please!
###55 I'll have more money next month.
###59 You can't take my house!
###61 Is that your signature?
###64 Okay. Well, just help me work something out, okay?
###67 I mean, you said I'm a good credit guy, right? I mean...
###69 Hey, wait!
###70 My dog is in there!
###72 No! Don't take my Dream!
###78 Oh, how did this happen?
###88 Hartman?
###89 Is that you?!
###90 Been a long time since the fourth grade.
###94 *Fourth grade*
###101 Is that a time machine?
###103 There's no need to concern yourself with my stunning accomplishments.
###107 Best get in. There's not much time.
###109 I've got to go down to the bank and get my life back.
###112 They took everything.
###114 Oh, the bank ain't gonna help you now.
###117 Look in the trunk.
###119 Extra set of balls. Put them on. You're gonna need them.
###121 You're gonna get my dream back?
###123 No, you are. I'm here to show you how.
###131 *Winter of 2006*
###132 Submitted for your approval: one First National Bank.
###136 What is a bank, you ask?
###138 A curious place where both space, time and irony exist; and yet, don't.
###144 Are you gonna be doing that the whole time?
###146 Pay attention, Pile.
###148 Exhibit A: those who have come to deposit and safely store their crrent monies.
###153 Exhibit B: those who need to borrow said money for purposes unknown.
###157 Hey, that's me!
###160 Ergo, exhibit C: the bank only has so much money in the vault to lend out to people such as you.
###167 Hey! Hey! That's the guy. He took my house.
###170 Really screwing my vibe here, Pile. Space-time continuum - he can't hear you.
###174 Just let me narrate. Now, where was I?
###178 So you see: by the time he got to you, Pile, his bank was out of money.
###183 But he gave me lots of money and charged me a lot of interest.
###187 Yes, that's the only way banks make money,
###190 by making debt loans.
###191 Debt = money, Pile.
###193 Remember that, debt = money.
###196 The more loans they make, the more money they make.
###199 But if they don't have any money, where did my money come from?
###202 You're gonna wanna take a step back.
###209 Woah! No way!�
###210 Yes way,
###211 and that's nothing.
###213 Hey buddy, need some money?
###218 They didn't to that!
###219 Oh, they did exactly that, Pile!
###222 Remember, banks make money by making loans, by selling debt.
###226 Even to bad credit risks.
###232 Yo, have some money, dude.
###234 Just sign here.
###236 Oh, my gosh!
###237 Mmm, they call it free money.
###239 Yeah, that's exactly what my loan guy told me: free money.
###243 But it ain't free.
###245 The worst part was offering money to people who don't even need it.
###248 People, Pile, like you.
###253 You're right, I didn't need him. I was happy here.
###264 Why is he sad? He's making all that money.
###267 Shhh... He's thinking.
###272 Now wait for it... Now wait for it...
###276 BIngo!
###278 See, the bankers loan to everyone in town,
###281 but to make more money they have to lone even more.
###284 More? How much money do they need?
###287 More.
###289 What's that?!
###290 Behold, a black horse rideth!
###293 Credit cards!
###309 Refinance Your Home!
###312 Wow, look! It's gonna be okay.
###315 Everything's gonna be okay.
###317 What now?
###318 Now? Well, Pile, with all this money, we might as well...
###322 ...partyyy!
###329 Oh ho, this is awesome. I needed to get my head clear.
###333 When I get back I'm gonna straighten all this out.
###336 I just hope Dream is doing okay.
###343 Ben Bernanke! I'm going to get you, my pretty!
###347 Yep, he is. I'm sure he is.
###352 Mmm... You put it on his tab. Little something for yourself.
###355 Wait.
###358 You know, wait a second Hartman. I just thought of something.
###362 If I got this money from the bank, and the bank got it from the Federal Reserve dump trucks...
###366 Go on...
###369 ...then where does the Federal Reserve get their money?
###372 Real nice time, ladies, real nice.
###375 Excuse me while I borrow these.
###378 Say, Hartman, why am I wearing a burglar bikini top.
###382 Because no one is allowed inside the Fed. Not you, not me, no American citizen,
###387 no duly elected member of our Congress, not the Supreme Court.
###390 Not the Supreme Court?
###392 Not the Supreme Court.
###394 Not the Justice Dep., not the CIA, DIA, FBI, ATF, BTE, NBC. Not even G-O-D.
###406 How come the government isn't allowed inside its own building?
###409 Government? Pile, the Fed is a private bank, owned by private stockholders.
###413 Do not let the name "Federal" fool you. This place is about as federal as Federal Express.
###418 A private bank? But... private?
###425 Shhh. Best to keep your voice down, Pile.
###430 This is Ethan, Federal Reserve.
###431 Hey Eth. Bill here, First National.
###433 Hi Bill, how are you?
###435 Good, good. We're running a little low on money?
###438 No problem, how much do you need?
###439 Oh, how does 20 million sound?
###441 What?!
###443 Excellent, we will ship it over first thing tomorrow.
###445 Wait, he can just call up the Fed and ask for more money and they give them whatever they want?
###450 No, Pile, the Fed don't give the banks money; the Fed loans the banks money.
###458 The banks have to pay it back with interest. Come on, time to go.
###461 Wait, wait, wait! I still don't understand. Where does the Fed get their money...
###466 I mean, if they're are private bank? You said they're a private bank, right? OK, so who puts money into the Fed bank?
###473 This is Mel, United States Mint.
###476 Hi ya Mel. First National needs another twenty millis.
###479 We're already running the presses full steam here, Ethan.
###482 Gotta keep making loans, Gotta keep the money flowing.
###484 All right, you're the Fed. What ever you guys say.
###487 Twenty million more, by morning!
###491 But I don't get it. What's so wrong about the Fed printing money?
###496 Because it's unconstitutional, Pile.
###498 Our treasury is supposed to create our money, but now the Fed controls the printing of America's money.
###504 Nobody gets a friggin dollar that the Fed didn't print.
###509 So?
###510 They print the money, then they loan it to the government, then they charge the government interest, and then the government taxes you to pay for it.
###516 Wake up, Pile.
###517 I don't see what the big deal is.
###520 Mmm,.. You know, you're right, Pile.
###522 Wait a minute. Wait... I am?
###523 Yeah! I forget how effective they are at keeping you ignorant.
###527 Oh, that's okay. Hey, I'm not ignorant!
###530 Do you even know what money is, Pile?
###533 *10th Century.*
###537 In the long, long ago, people bartered. They traded things they had for things they wanted. I'll trade you my raspberries for that there pot pie.�
###546 I don't want your berries.
###548 Come on, Pile! They're sweet berries.
###551 They're not sweet, they're old. And I don't like berries.
###553 Give me that pot pie!!!
###554 No!
###555 As you can see, this bartering situation created some problems.
###559 Then one day, a goldsmith walked up and said:
###562 Now, everybody thinks gold is valuable so why doesn't everybody trade gold for things they need?
###569 Price was set for gold and now it was very easy to conduct commerce
###574 because people could trade gold for all the things they needed.
###577 Hartman! Wow, look at all my gold!
###582 Hey, hey, stop them! That's my gold!
###585 Damn thieves!
###586 Say there, Pile, I've got a vault and some guards. I can keep your gold safe for you
###591 for a small fee.
###593 Yeah, sure. That would be awesome.
###595 You see, Pile, this is how the first bank made money.
###599 There you go, Pile. I owe you 100 gold coins.
###602 Okay, great!
###604 Come back any time and redeem your gold when you want it. It'll be right here, in my vault.
###610 Now you're holding the very first paper money, Pile.
###614 Wow, this is great! It all makes sense.
###618 Oh, that's right, it was good. Everybody started using I.O.U.s because everybody knew the I.O.U. was as good as gold.
###627 Wow, this candy is really a good price: one I.O.U. Hmm, I'm getting some more for later.
###633 Hey, wait a minute. It was just one I.O.U. Ten I.O.U."s for chocolate? They can't just raise prices like that.
###641 Oh, the candy man can.
###647 Wait, that is just friggin wrong.
###650 It's called inflation, Pile. It makes your I.O.U.s worth less and less until they are worth nothing. Less bang for the buck.
###656 Dollar ain't what it used to be.
###659 But I worked hard and I baked all those pot pies. Now I have to work harder to make less?
###665 That's not fair!
###666 Oh, if you think that's not fair, you're gonna love the next part.
###672 Oh, what's he doing?
###673 How do banks make money, Pile?
###675 Ah, by making more loans?
###677 Oh that's right, he's good.
###680 You see, he prints more IOUs without any more gold,
###683 loans them out for interest, makes a pretty penny, and nobody is the wiser...
###687 unless everybody wanted their gold back at the same time.
###690 No, no, no. That's my gold.
###693 Not anymore.
###696 What are you talking about?
###698 I'd like to redeem my IOUs please.
###701 Thank you very much.
###702 Hey!
###706 I want my gold back now!
###709 Thief! Thief!
###710 I love the bank run. Bringing people together.
###713 See, they all found out he was stealing, made a run on the bank and demanded their gold. But as you can see, there ain't no gold to get.
###721 Hartman!
###723 Don't worry, Pile. Back in these times, vengeance will be yours.
###727 Three things in this world you don't do. Never mess with another man's woman.
###731 Never mess with another man's ego.
###733 And most importantly you never mess with another man's money.
###741 Else, the man will mess with you.
###744 My god, you hung him?
###747 Yes, Pile. Oh, we hung him. We hung him high!
###750 And do you know why?
###753 Because he was a thief?
###756 Because, Pile, an evil intention was born.
###759 Man discovered how to turn worthless paper into gold.
###764 Thus was invented the ultimate machine to steal real money and enslave all the nations on earth.
###775 It's alive!
###777 Oh now, come on, you're just being dramatic.
###779 I mean, I lost my house but...
###781 What is that? Explain.
###782 The nuclear power plant?
###784 Um, hmm. Produces lots of electricity and little pollution. An invention for the good of humanity.
###790 Okay, but what's this have to do with...
###792 3, 2...
###797 Atomic energy. A discovery more powerful than anything man had yet conceived.
###802 It can be used for good or evil.
###807 Now, unlike Einstein, the goldsmith's discovery has been kept a closely guarded secret.
###812 It was never intended for you to see.
###814 This discovery is called fractional reserved banking.
###818 In the wrong hands, it's more powerful than a nuclear bomb
###822 in its ability to completely and utterly destroy a nation who is subjected to its perversion.
###828 No. No, no, no, no.
###831 It is time we stop this evil secret and the men behind it...
###835 You're being ridiculous.
###836 ...before America is destroyed forever.
###839 Believe it, Pile
###841 No, no, no, no. I just want my dog back.
###844 Dammit! That's it, I give up. Let them live in chains.
###849 No, Hartman.
###851 The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants.
###857 Thomas Jefferson?
###859 Mr. President, how do I get him to understand?
###862 As we did, son. Remain vigilant.
###866 To many have hidden the truth and the light of our liberty dims with every passing day.
###872 Quickly, take my horse. Show him.
###876 Wait. Show me what? Where are we going?
###878 Away, stallion of liberty.
###881 Ride hard the holy wind.
###885 Oh, where are we?
###887 The Battle of Waterloo.
###888 Hold on. We gotta get through.
###892 The money machine. There it is!
###894 Hey, is that the same people?
###896 Rich banker men from Germany flying under the banner of the Red Shield. (Rothschild)
###900 They financed both sides of the war.
###902 We must hurry.
###905 That's him, the Red Shield courier. Shoot him!
###907 No. I'm not shooting any one.
###910 Dammit, Pile.
###911 What?
###912 He beat everyone back with the news of the war and told England that Napoleon won.
###916 London Stock Exchange
###919 The Red Shield bankers of London pretended that England was doomed and started selling their English stocks.
###923 The English went into a selling frenzy to get rid of worthless English money.
###926 But, the English won, right?
###929 Of course they won. But it was a trick by Red Shield.
###932 They waited until the stocks plummeted to pennies and then bought England back back for nearly nothing.
###938 What? They did that? How?
###941 When the English leaders found out, they had no choice but to give themselves over to the Red Shield.
###946 Their money was gone and they were slaves to the Red Shield war debt.
###950 Since that time the English have been paying their national taxes directly to the Red Shield private bankers.
###956 The people have no idea.
###959 But the bankers bragged about what they did to us.
###961 Laughing at us all the way to the bank.
###964 *Buckingham Palace. Nathan Rothschild* Why it's the best business I've ever done.
###967 "If I can control a nation's wealth, I care not who makes its laws." (quote M.A. Rothschild)
###973 Oh, is this what Jefferson wanted to show me?
###977 No, Pile. Look.
###981 They're in America too?
###983 The Red Shield banks are here, Pile,
###986 seeking a way to conquer our American Dream.
###988 The dream you had, Pile.
###990 A dream... of free men.
###993 They tried to take over our country many times and failed
###996 because Jefferson and the patriots vowed to stop the evil tyrants at all costs.
###1004 By authority of eternal God he would not let the bankers win here.
###1009 "To preserve our independence we must not let our rulers load us with perpetual debt.
###1015 We must make our choice between economy and liberty
###1018 or profusion and servitude.
###1020 (quote Thomase Jefferson)
###1021 I place economy among the most important and republican virtues,
###1026 and public debt is the greatest of the dangers to be feared.
###1030 It is incumbent on every generation to pay its own debts as it goes."
###1035 We must have a central bank to secure this country's finances!
###1039 "If the American people ever allow private banks to control the issue of their money,
###1045 first by inflation and then by deflation, the banks and corporations that will grow up around them
###1052 will deprive the people of their property until their children will wake up homeless
###1057 on the very continent their fathers conquered!"
###1060 Jefferson, you're mad! This country will have a central bank.
###1065 Who's that?
###1066 America's first Secretary Of Treasury.
###1069 Alexander Hamilton?
###1071 Not for long.
###1072 Aaron Burr, Thomas Jefferson's Vice President.
###1075 They didn't take too kindly to our first Sec Treasury.
###1080 Sweet shot, Burr.
###1083 The first attempt at a central bank only lasted 20 years and we shut it down.
###1087 But the bankers tried again against Old Hickory, Andrew Jackson.
###1092 You are a den of vipers and thieves.
###1095 I intend to route you out and by the eternal God I will route you out.
###1102 After surviving an assassination attempt, Jackson finally defeated the bank in 1836.
###1108 When asked what was the greatest accomplishment in his life, Old Hickory replied,
###1112 I killed the bank.
###1116 And those were his last words: "I killed the bank."
###1123 And, with reel money backed with real gold,
###1125 our country experienced the greatest boom in any nation's history.
###1129 Oh, it was beautiful, Pile.
###1132 But the bankers, greedy for more power and wealth, were concocting their most ambitious plan yet:
###1137 to once and for all take control of the finances of the United States.
###1142 In 1910, a secret meeting was held in the J.P. Morgan estate
###1146 on Jekyll Island of the coast of Georgia.
###1149 This meeting was so secret, so concealed from government and public knowledge,
###1153 that the 10 attendees used code names.
###1160 I am clearly the richest man,
###1162 so I should be the one to run the super secret central bank.
###1166 I own all the oil in America. I'm clearly richer than you will ever be Hula Girl.
###1170 I should run the super secret central bank.
###1173 You're nothing compared to me, Lube Job. I shall run the secret bank.
###1178 Silence!
###1181 Supreme master leader, I didn't know you were gonna be here.
###1184 I'm not. Neither are you, dumb ass.
###1188 Oh yeah, right, right.
###1190 He's so smart!
###1192 None of you shall run the bank.
###1195 We have failed in the past because of openness.
###1198 This time the key to success is secrecy.
###1201 The people must believe that they run the bank.
###1205 Yes, brilliant! A sneak attack. What's the plan?
###1210 We first create panic, then we show them the solution.
###1214 With our man in office and well-planned timing
###1217 we will have our central bank.
###1219 And so the people think it is theirs. We shall christen it Federal!
###1223 the Federal Reserve!
###1231 They struck on December 23rd, 1913
###1235 when most of our congress were home eating fruit cake
###1238 These bastards, I mean bankers,
###1241 presented their treasonous act to their newly elected accomplice Woodrow Wilson...
###1245 ...who had fortuitously already agreed to sign it before he was even elected.
###1250 Wait. The IRS?
###1253 I thought we always had the IRS.
###1255 No, Pile. They did this to us too.
###1259 The Fed now has the exclusive power to print America's money.
###1265 They loan this money to our banks and our government at interest,
###1268 putting immediate debt on our own money,
###1273 printing more and more so each dollar they print becomes worth less than the one before.
###1282 Merry... Christmas.
###1287 What in the hell is that?
###1290 That, Pile, is how our government must now pay back these debts to the Fed.
###1295 Your taxes do not go to your government.
###1298 They don't?
###1299 Hmm. It's the greatest theft in human history.
###1302 Okay. I mean, I sorta get what you're saying,
###1306 but it's also confusing and really Hartman,
###1308 I don't see how it affects me at all.
###1310 If I had more money, none of this would have happened!
###1313 Hartman?
###1319 1955. Wow, what are we doing here?
###1322 Oh, a little bit of shopping.
###1324 Here, hold this. Gallon of gas: 23 cents.
###1327 Postage stamp: 3 cents. Ounce of gold: 35 $.
###1332 Hot baby: priceless.
###1335 Best be getting back.
###1337 Hey Hartman, I need my car, man!
###1339 Oh, was that Michael J...
###1342 Yeah, he'll be fine.
###1346 Now, Pile, would you agree that you have the same exact things that you had in 1955?
###1351 Yeah. One stamp, one gallon of gas, one ounce of gold and one home.
###1358 Well, we just made a lot of money.
###1362 Hey!
###1364 Gotta pay your taxes. Bet it's nice to have made all that money.
###1369 Wait, that isn't fair! Now I actually have less money.
###1373 I can't even go buy the things I just sold.
###1375 The IRS and the Fed's inflation work together, Pile.
###1379 They aren't just taxing gain, they are taxing their inflation.
###1383 You are no richer than you were in 1955.
###1386 Now, does that sound fair or American to you?
###1389 Yeah, but I mean, who doesn't hate taxes? I hate the IRS anyway.
###1393 Pile, the higher they make the inflation, the more of your they take.
###1398 It's thievery.
###1400 You're not paying taxes on any more, you are paying taxes on the same and now you have less!
###1407 They take our property right in front of our eyes
###1410 just like Thomas Jefferson said they would.
###1414 What's that?
###1416 They found us!
###1418 Quick, my sword!
###1420 What sword?
###1422 We don't need your banking machine! I condemn you to die, dammit! Die!
###1428 Pile, Bernanke bogie on my nine. Take him at his knees.
###1441 "For we are opposed around the world by a monolithic and ruthless conspiracy
###1446 that relies primarily on covert means for expanding its sphere of influence."
###1452 What's happening? Where are we?
###1455 I believe perhaps you understand now, Pile. But you are afraid.
###1459 JFK. Hartman, what does this have to do with my house and my dog?
###1464 Okay, that's enough. I want to go home now.
###1466 This is the last president to stand up to the Fed.
###1470 You must see...
###1472 On June 4, 1963, President Kennedy signed Executive Order 11110.
###1479 This executive order empowered the U.S. Treasury to issue real money without the Fed.
###1484 It would have worked.
###1486 Kennedy's plan to dismantle the Federal Reserve machine had begun.
###1491 Six months later, John F. Kennedy went to Dallas and never returned.
###1496 No way. No way they could do that.
###1500 The new president, Lyndon Johnson, threw out Kennedy's order.
###1503 And since JFK, no president has dared confront the secret powers behind the Federal Reserve.
###1510 They consolidate bigger and bigger banks, print more and more money, accountable to no one,
###1516 decimating our nation's wealth for the benefit of a few.
###1521 Why? Why do this? If they hurt us it hurts the global bankers too.
###1525 No, Pile, they are protected. They are too big to fail.
###1533 But I'm not. Those sons of bitches!
###1537 Mmm, sons of bitches all.
###1547 The day was cold,
###1551 the wind sharp and strong,
###1555 but we were determined!
###1557 The bankers and their parasites had us vastly outnumbered
###1561 but their hubris made them weak.
###1565 Not like us.
###1567 not like this band of immortals we have assembled.
###1570 We have come to take back our...
###1574 Hartman, is that...?
###1577 My dog!
###1579 Oh, sh...
###1583 Then the inevitable. The money kings could ignore us no longer.
###1589 They sent an emissary, a cog in the machine of greed, to bring about our submission,
###1596 Hank Paulson.
###1598 Hartman, this is blasphemy. We own the corners of the earth.
###1603 It is futile to challenge us.
###1605 Oh, I've seen that look before,
###1609 that of a predator taking in the scent of its prey:
###1612 bold, fearless, the look of a free man.
###1618 You have come far, Hartman, father than most. Be smart now; join us!
###1624 We will bring you money, power, everything you want!
###1628 You can be one of us if you will kneel.
###1679 Madman! You're a madman!�
###1683 We are offering you everything! What do you think this is?!
###1692 THIS IS AMERICA!
