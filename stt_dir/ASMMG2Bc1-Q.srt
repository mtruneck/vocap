the early '70s.

For any Asian immigrant
at that time you

food after doing the law,

0:3:17,3 --> 0:3:19,3
trying to be a journalist,
doing all these things.


98
0:3:19,3 --> 0:3:23,35
Because I realized that I would
be given a fair shake in

a fair shake at a lot of

to be good at food.

cousins are really smart and


102
0:3:30,615 --> 0:3:33,53

always the black sheep.
