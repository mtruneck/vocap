###0 
###0 MICHEL GONDRY: It's running?
###1 MALE SPEAKER 1: Yeah.
###3 It is.
###4 CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG: [LAUGH]
###5 MICHEL GONDRY: What about my make up?
###7 I know my nose is always shiny.
###9 I don't care.
###10 OK, also, we speak English?
###12 OK.
###13 I remember when we shot Science of Sleep, you were
###19 hiding from the camera, especially
###20 in the first scenes.
###22 And it's interesting.
###24 CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG: But I remember, I don't know, it has
###26 nothing to do with this, but I remember, I must have been
###29 used to so many years of hiding because I was on my
###36 mother's sets when she was acting, and just hiding to
###42 look at the scene.
###42 So I was in this position of trying to find the place where
###47 nobody would say, go away and just being like a mouse.
###53 And spying on the scenes and loving it.
###57 And then suddenly, when I was, I don't know, 12 when I did my
###62 first film, I remember hearing people say, move away.
###67 And I always thought it was me.
###69 MICHEL GONDRY: [LAUGH]
###70 CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG: And no, this time it wasn't me.
###72 MICHEL GONDRY: That's great.
###74 Actually, I had the same feeling with Mos Def.
###76 Mos Def, he is so oblivious of the camera, that he would
###81 always end up to have his back like blocking the view.
###84 Sometimes I just have to ask him to go away.
###86 At least, if you don't want to be in the show, don't stop the
###89 others from being in the shot.
###91 But I have to say, in counterparty,
###94 he has a great presence.
###95 Because he's not--
###96 if you put the camera here, he's not going to feel that
###98 the camera. is there.
###100 And I think you have this quality too.
###102 That you can be scrutinized by the camera, or I guess, the
###106 microphone or whatever.
###109 And it doesn't feel you're
###111 communicating with this equipment.
###114 You're still communicating with the other
###116 person or the audience.
###118 But a lot of peoples have--
###120 to me I see that as, they have a little eye
###123 inside of their eye.
###124 So if, for instance, if I look at you and I'm aware that the
###127 camera is here, I'm not really looking at you.
###130 In fact, I'm looking at the camera here to make sure the
###133 camera looks at me.
###134 And a lot of actors have this problem.
###137 It's very hard because you want to help them to be
###141 communicating with the person, to create the moment.
###144 But they have little eyes in the white of their eye that is
###147 looking to the camera, and it's horrible.
###149 You coming from, probably, the most famous couple from this
###154 era in France?
###157 CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG: Yeah, because I was young when I
###160 started, I didn't think, ooh, I have to be as
###165 good as them, or--
###166 
###169 I was just having fun with the films.
###172 And with the album, I did think--
###176 I was preoccupied, yeah.
###182 And that's why I chose to do it in English, was because I
###186 didn't want myself to be able to compare the words with what
###191 he had written.
###194 Because it was too strong for me.
###198 MICHEL GONDRY: Using the foreign language, it's a very
###200 good help for this kind of--
###202 CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG: It was easier for me, much easier.
###206 Because I remember, I tried to write, and it was so
###210 dreadful, in French.
###213 And I read stuff.
###216 And maybe I could've read a masterpiece, I
###222 wouldn't have seen it.
###224 I was just pushing everything away.
###226 MICHEL GONDRY: Yeah, there's too much things interfering.
###228 CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG: Yeah.
###229 MICHEL GONDRY: But there is this relation that's really
###232 complex and interesting because all those guys that
###237 worked on this album are direct influenced by what your
###244 father did.
###245 CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG: Yeah, yeah.
###246 MICHEL GONDRY: And basically their music is a tribute.
###249 Without you, way before they met you, the music is a
###252 tribute to what your father was doing.
###253 CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG: But each time I could hear that
###255 something was close to one of my father's songs in the music
###260 I was really proud.
###261 It was in the words that I didn't want to be like a pale
###268 copy of something he had done.
###270 In the music, they came out like tributes.
###273 MICHEL GONDRY: Yeah.
###274 CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG: And we were all aware of, not my
###277 father's presence, but it was like, everybody knew what I
###281 had in my head, that he was--
###284 that I thought about him all the time.
###287 And Air, and Nigel, and Jarvis, and Neil Hannon, too,
###292 they were all very, very discreet about him.
###298 And I was always starting to talk about him.
###303 It was strange, yeah.
###304 MICHEL GONDRY: Yeah, that's interesting, yeah.
###307 But I think it's a nice loop that comes back to a sort of
###313 healthy place.
###315 The way inspiration and tribute and then coming back
###320 to where it started, and somewhat in a different
###325 generation.
###326 CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG: Mmm.
###327 MICHEL GONDRY: So we're talking about
###330 being in the studio.
###333 And I like the idea that the studio is a place where things
###337 are created.
###339 CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG: Yeah, well for me it
###341 was also just being--
###342 
###345 because I wasn't composing any music.
###348 And I was trying to write lyrics, but I wasn't
###351 very good at it.
###352 And I was very embarrassed about myself,
###355 and what I was writing.
###357 So at the beginning, I was really enjoying just being a
###360 witness of their work.
###363 And just being able to be there whilst they were
###366 creating something, and instrument after instrument.
###371 It was such a magical time for me.
###374 And with Nigel behind the commands.
###378 But I remember, before we started going in the studio, I
###384 remember just talking to Nicolas and Jean-Benoit, for
###388 such a long time because I was so scared to start something
###393 that I wanted to talk about what it was going to be like,
###397 and what kind of music, and the words were so
###401 important for me.
###402 So what lyrics, and after a while, they just pushed me and
###406 said, we can't just talk about it for years.
###411 You have to go in the studio and see what happens.
###414 And it's true because maybe nothing could've happened.
###419 And it just did.
###423 And with no pressure.
###426 Until we weren't happy, we could go on.
###430 And that was a great luxury to have that.
###434 MICHEL GONDRY: So they were really probably so pleased to
###437 be next to you.
###439 And I think sometimes, even if you don't physically or
###442 actively participate, if you're there next to the
###444 person, it makes all the difference.
###446 CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG: I think it did make
###447 a difference because--
###450 MICHEL GONDRY: Because they feel they are doing it with
###452 you, even though you weren't singing.
###453 Although where they would feel like just record like session
###457 musicians, and then you come to do your vocals.
###459 CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG: Exactly.
###460 I would have hated to just receive a CD with all the
###463 tracks and then just go in the studio and record it.
###467 I wanted to be there.
###468 I wanted to be a part of everything.
###471 And I know that they knew that.
###474 I needed that time, also, for myself, to be able to go
###479 behind the microphone and just try things.
###483 MICHEL GONDRY: That's nice.
###484 It reminds me, I did some video with Bjork where she's
###488 hardly not in it.
###489 We flew over Iceland, and we took a lot of pictures.
###492 But I was scared to death in the small plane.
###494 We went to this airport, and they have some crashed plane
###498 on the side, and we're have to go in the same one.
###500 And she would go, always, with me.
###502 And I think the fact that she was there, and even if she's
###507 not in front of the camera, it's like it goes through me,
###512 like waves or something.
###514 And I think I always try to work this way.
###518 Even if the artist is not in front of the camera.
###521 He has to be behind or it's a collaborative [INAUDIBLE].
###524 CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG: Yeah.
###527 And Nigel was very important, too, because
###532 he was a great judge.
###534 And I felt very close to him in his--
###537 
###540 every judgement he had on the lyrics, mainly, for me.
###545 He was a great support.
###550 Also, to be able to think about subjects I wanted to
###557 talk about.
###557 And just to make it feel personal, I had
###564 to do it that way.
###566 MICHEL GONDRY: How old is he?
###568 CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG: Nigel?
###568 He's exactly my age.
###569 He's 35.
###572 MICHEL GONDRY: And so he worked
###573 with Beck and Radiohead?
###576 CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG: He worked with Beck, with
###577 Radiohead, with Paul McCartney.
###581 I was very intimidated at first.
###584 Especially once the music was, not finished, but there were
###590 times when I had to try and put my voice on.
###594 I was so embarrassed, thinking he's worked with such talent.
###600 MICHEL GONDRY: He has the same feeling,
###601 probably, towards you.
###603 CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG: He can see I'm a fake.
###604 [LAUGHTER]
###608 
###615 MICHEL GONDRY: So are you going to tour with the band?
###618 CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG: I don't think I can.
###620 
###625 I don't think I'm capable of doing something.
###628 But maybe later.
###628 Maybe when I won't feel I have to, I'll want to do it.
###634 But for the moment, I'm just too nervous about it.
###639 MICHEL GONDRY: Well, don't you think this nervousness is
###641 going to give something to the concert?
###644 CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG: No.
###644 MICHEL GONDRY: Oh, I think so.
###646 CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG: No.
###647 MICHEL GONDRY: But I think the awkwardness is very--
###654 he gives you a different level of
###656 connection with your audience.
###658 And I find that with Bjork.
###659 Bjork, OK she's a very professional singer.
###662 And she's done a ton of concerts.
###664 But she doesn't connect with the audience
###666 in a classical sense.
###668 She's not going to talk to the microphone and say, hey, New
###672 York I love you.
###673 All this bullshit.
###674 She's on camera.
###674 CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG: No, of course, but she's such a
###675 performer that something--
###677 MICHEL GONDRY: I know but, I think--
###678 CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG: --is happening.
###679 MICHEL GONDRY: What I like the most in her concert is this
###682 non-connection she makes with the audience.
###685 CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG: Yeah, but no, the thing is, I'm
###687 worried that--
###689 and really, it's not fake modesty or something.
###692 But I'm just worried it will be very boring.
###696 Because I'm not a performer, so [INTERPOSING VOICES].
###701 MICHEL GONDRY: Well, to me what's boring is
###703 professionalism.
###705 There is some quality in not being in
###710 control of the situation.
###711 CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG: Yeah, but also, the thing is, for
###713 this album, because we did it all together with Air and
###718 Jarvis, the fact that I would be on stage on my own without
###725 them doesn't make any sense.
###727 MICHEL GONDRY: Well, of course, but why don't
###728 you tour with them?
###729 CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG: Well, they have their
###731 own album to release.
###732 MICHEL GONDRY: All right, well that's different.
###733 But I think you should tour with them, yes.
###736 I saw them in Los Angeles.
###739 And they were doing the songs.
###740 The singer that was doing their big hit at the time--
###744 I forgot her name-- and she was so shy.
###747 It was a great moment.
###748 Obviously, she was just coming from one song, and she could
###751 hardly sing.
###752 And it was a great moment because the audience just
###755 wanted go with her, and help her.
###758 And it was really--
###759 CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG: An American singer?
###761 MICHEL GONDRY: Yeah, it was in--
###762 I don't know if she's American or English.
###765 It's that song that goes [SINGING].
###769 It's one of their big hits.
###771 CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG: Yeah, and she sings on
###774 the album, or she?
###774 MICHEL GONDRY: Yeah, yeah, that was the singer on the
###776 album, but she sing few songs, or maybe only one.
###779 But she came for this song.
###782 I can't sing it, but it goes [SINGING].
###786 Do you know it?
###787 CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG: [LAUGH]
###794 MICHEL GONDRY: So anyway, yeah, you
###794 should tour with them.
###795 You should not tour with the professional [INAUDIBLE].
###798 CHARLOTTE GAINSBOURG: Yeah.
###800
