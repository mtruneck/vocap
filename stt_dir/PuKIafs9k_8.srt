CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: We`re a week and a
half away from Halloween, the presidential


2
0:0:16,94 --> 0:0:21,49
election is two weeks off and you are right
on time for a new week of CNN STUDENT NEWS.


3
0:0:21,49 --> 0:0:25,599
My name is Carl Azuz, let`s go ahead and get
started.


4
0:0:25,599 --> 0:0:30,35
First up, protesters in Lebanon, including
one former prime minister, are speaking out


5
0:0:30,35 --> 0:0:34,82
against Lebanon`s current prime minister.
They want him out of office. Lebanon is home


6
0:0:34,82 --> 0:0:40,41
to around 4 million people. It`s located in
the Middle East, on the Mediterranean Sea,


7
0:0:40,41 --> 0:0:45,64
right next door to Syria. Some observers are
concerned that the violence that`s been going


8
0:0:45,64 --> 0:0:51,789
in Syria could spread to Lebanon where it
has already. Last Friday a car bomb went off


9
0:0:51,789 --> 0:0:56,969
in the Lebanese capital of Beirut. Three people
were killed including the country`s intelligence


10
0:0:56,969 --> 0:1:3,149
chief. Syria spoke out against the attack,
but some Lebanese officials blame Syria for


11
0:1:3,149 --> 0:1:8,64
it. Yesterday, after the intelligence leaders
funeral protesters fought with security forces


12
0:1:8,64 --> 0:1:14,539
in Beirut. The crowd threw rocks, police used
tear gas to break up the protests. Several


13
0:1:14,539 --> 0:1:16,6
people were reportedly injured.


14
0:1:16,6 --> 0:1:17,539
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


15
0:1:17,539 --> 0:1:23,25
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Is this legit? Someone
is officially recognized as a saint when he


16
0:1:23,25 --> 0:1:26,66
or she is canonized.


17
0:1:26,66 --> 0:1:32,539
This is true. In the Roman Catholic Church,
canonization is the act of recognizing a saint.


18
0:1:32,539 --> 0:1:35,53
(END VIDEO CLIP)


19
0:1:35,53 --> 0:1:40,77
AZUZ: The Roman Catholic Church recognized
seven people as new saints over the weekend.


20
0:1:40,77 --> 0:1:45,94
The canonization ceremony included some history
as well. For the first time, a Native American


21
0:1:45,94 --> 0:1:51,89
was named a saint. During a special mass in
Saint Peter`s Square on Sunday, Pope Benedict


22
0:1:51,89 --> 0:1:57,97
XVI and other worshippers celebrated the new
saints. The pope praised Kateri Tekawitha


23
0:1:57,97 --> 0:2:2,869
for living a life of service. Tekawitha was
a member of the Mohawk Tribe, sometimes known


24
0:2:2,869 --> 0:2:8,22
as Lily of the Mohawks. She converted to Catholicism
and served as a nun.


25
0:2:8,22 --> 0:2:12,92
This week is a special time for another world
religion. It`s Hajj, one of the five main


26
0:2:12,92 --> 0:2:18,9
observances of Islam. Millions of Muslims
participate in Hajj every year, traveling


27
0:2:18,9 --> 0:2:23,18
to the city of Mecca in Saudi Arabia. Fionnuala
Sweeney has more on this annual tradition.


28
0:2:23,18 --> 0:2:24,23
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


29
0:2:24,23 --> 0:2:28,9
FIONNUALA SWEENEY, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Its
name means "to set out for a place," and for


30
0:2:28,9 --> 0:2:35,75
Muslims around the world, that place is the
holy city of Mecca. The Hajj has begun for


31
0:2:35,75 --> 0:2:40,53
millions of Muslims, with pilgrims making
their way toward Islam`s most sacred site.


32
0:2:40,53 --> 0:2:47,58
A cube shaped building called the Kaabaa located
in the Grand Mosque. For daily prayers, Muslims


33
0:2:47,58 --> 0:2:52,87
face this structure from any given point in
the world. They are also required, if able,


34
0:2:52,87 --> 0:2:57,87
to make this pilgrimage at least once in their
lives. And then walk seven times around the


35
0:2:57,87 --> 0:3:1,66
Kaabaa, counter clockwise in a ritual called
the Tawaf.


36
0:3:1,66 --> 0:3:5,99
IBTISAM SAYED HASSAN, EGYPTIAN PILGRIM (through
translator): Islam is beautiful, and we are


37
0:3:5,99 --> 0:3:9,56
beautiful. We love all people, we love all
countries.


38
0:3:9,56 --> 0:3:15,16
SWEENEY: The Grand Mosque`s gleaming minarets
soar skyward, pilgrims here cry as perform


39
0:3:15,16 --> 0:3:23,19
the daily prayers from these towers, calling
the faithful five times a day. Fionnuala Sweeney,


40
0:3:23,19 --> 0:3:23,69
CNN.

0:3:23,69 --> 0:3:24,68
(END VIDEOTAPE)


42
0:3:24,68 --> 0:3:30,94
AZUZ: To our viewers who are already on Facebook,
at Facebook.com/cnnstudentnews, we asked if


43
0:3:30,94 --> 0:3:35,72
the release of a popular videogame could distract
some people from voting.


44
0:3:35,72 --> 0:3:40,79
Awnna says "Maybe. Some people are so obsessed
with video games that they put aside the thought


45
0:3:40,79 --> 0:3:42,89
of who`s running our nation."


46
0:3:42,89 --> 0:3:48,22
Nicolo assumes that most people who are interested
in games aren`t as interested in the presidential


47
0:3:48,22 --> 0:3:49,24
election."


48
0:3:49,24 --> 0:3:54,0
Janie writes, "I play games, but I`m voting
this year. If someone lets a game to take


49
0:3:54,0 --> 0:3:57,33
their right to vote away, then they are ungrateful.


50
0:3:57,33 --> 0:4:1,99
Tyler doesn`t think video games will be distracting.
He says most people interested in Halo aren`t


51
0:4:1,99 --> 0:4:3,38
old enough to vote.


52
0:4:3,38 --> 0:4:8,11
Jamie says, "Games are better than politics
when the country is in dire financial crisis.


53
0:4:8,11 --> 0:4:11,44
You need something to lift people`s spirits
and lighten the mood.


54
0:4:11,44 --> 0:4:16,959
From Bridgette, "As a gamer, I get excited
for releases and caught up in the game. But


55
0:4:16,959 --> 0:4:20,99
taking a few minutes to vote is not a difficult
thing to do.


56
0:4:20,99 --> 0:4:24,71
From Andrew, if a person puts a videogame
before their future, then our country is in


57
0:4:24,71 --> 0:4:31,1
trouble. And Cambria says, "As time goes on,
game releases could impact things if politics


58
0:4:31,1 --> 0:4:35,139
doesn`t move into a region that everyone cares
deeply about.


59
0:4:35,139 --> 0:4:39,75
But before we get to election day, President
Obama and Republican presidential nominee


60
0:4:39,75 --> 0:4:45,78
Romney go head to head in person one more
time. It`s debate number three, it`s in Boca


61
0:4:45,78 --> 0:4:51,57
Raton, Florida, it`s happening tonight at
9 p.m. Eastern. Before you watch the debate


62
0:4:51,57 --> 0:4:57,48
either on CNN or at cnn.com/debates, Athena
Jones gives us a preview of what to look for.


63
0:4:57,48 --> 0:4:57,93
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


64
0:4:57,93 --> 0:5:1,88
ATHENA JONES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: The third
and final face-off between President Obama


65
0:5:1,88 --> 0:5:5,2
and Governor Romney will focus entirely on
foreign policy.


66
0:5:5,2 --> 0:5:7,18
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: No! Get out! Get out! Get
out!


67
0:5:7,18 --> 0:5:12,55
JONES: From Afghanistan and Pakistan to Israel,
Iran and the changing Middle East.


68
0:5:12,55 --> 0:5:13,59
(CROSSTALK)


69
0:5:13,59 --> 0:5:19,8
JONES: The candidates will spar over America`s
role in the world, the new face of terrorism


70
0:5:19,8 --> 0:5:23,84
and how to deal with the rising China. With
polls showing the president`s advantage over


71
0:5:23,84 --> 0:5:29,25
Romney on foreign policy has narrowed since
the summer, Mr. Obama tried to highlight one


72
0:5:29,25 --> 0:5:33,53
of his biggest foreign policy accomplishments
at a light-hearted charity dinner in New York.


73
0:5:33,53 --> 0:5:42,1
OBAMA: And Monday`s debate is a little bit
different because the topic is foreign policy.


74
0:5:42,1 --> 0:5:44,9
Spoiler alert -- we got bin Laden.


75
0:5:44,9 --> 0:5:44,44
(laughter)


76
0:5:44,44 --> 0:5:49,8
JONES: For his part, Romney could try again
to bash the president for his administration`s


77
0:5:49,8 --> 0:5:55,9
messy response to the attack in Libya last
month and link it to what he says a failed


78
0:5:55,9 --> 0:5:55,919
approach to the region.


79
0:5:55,919 --> 0:5:58,2
MITT ROMNEY, REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE:
This calls into question the president`s whole


80
0:5:58,2 --> 0:6:3,4
policy in the Middle East. Look what`s happening
in Syria, in Egypt, now in Libya.


81
0:6:3,4 --> 0:6:6,83
JON ALTERMAN, CSIS, DIR., MIDDLE EAST PROGRAM:
The challenge for President Obama is going


82
0:6:6,83 --> 0:6:14,139
to be defining the Middle East strategy going
forward. I mean, he`s had some successes,


83
0:6:14,139 --> 0:6:17,38
he`s had some things that are still pretty
murky.


84
0:6:17,38 --> 0:6:19,15
JONES: Romney`s task could be bigger.


85
0:6:19,15 --> 0:6:25,21
ALTERMAN: I think for Romney, there is a broad
challenge, and that is how do you drill down


86
0:6:25,21 --> 0:6:30,37
into specific policies? The Republican Party
hasn`t really figured out what a Republican


87
0:6:30,37 --> 0:6:38,87
foreign policy looks like after the Bush administration.
I think Romney has been uneager to really


88
0:6:38,87 --> 0:6:40,0
delve into that.


89
0:6:40,0 --> 0:6:44,11
JONES: Still, while important to many voters,
foreign policy ranks far below the economy.


90
0:6:44,11 --> 0:6:47,669
RYAN LIZZA, "THE NEW YORKER": If you are Mitt
Romney, every second you are talking about


91
0:6:47,669 --> 0:6:54,2
foreign policy is wasted, which might mean
that Romney tries to break out of that and


92
0:6:54,2 --> 0:6:59,419
tries to bring home some of the foreign policy
issues to domestic economic issues.


93
0:6:59,419 --> 0:7:4,419
JONES: With time running out, this is their
last chance to make their case to millions


94
0:7:4,419 --> 0:7:8,4
of voters in a single night. Athena Jones,
CNN, Washington.


95

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today`s "Shoutout" goes
out to Mrs. Scarborough`s "Studizens" at Independence


98
0:7:16,24 --> 0:7:17,68
Middle School in Virginia Beach, Virginia.


99
0:7:17,68 --> 0:7:25,169
The Rangers, Kings, Bruins and Jets all play
in what professional sports league? Here we


100
0:7:25,169 --> 0:7:35,699
go, is it the NBA, MLB, NFL or NHL? You`ve
got three seconds, go!


101
0:7:35,699 --> 0:7:43,139
The only place you`ll find all four of those
teams is the National Hockey League. That`s


102
0:7:43,139 --> 0:7:45,93
your answer and that`s your "Shoutout."


103
0:7:45,93 --> 0:7:48,199
(END VIDEO CLIP)


104
0:7:48,199 --> 0:7:54,11
AZUZ: The thing is, you won`t see any of those
teams on the ice any time soon. The National


105
0:7:54,11 --> 0:7:58,729
Hockey League season was supposed to start
in October, 11th. The league already canceled


106
0:7:58,729 --> 0:8:4,639
its schedule through October 24th, and on
Friday it extended that through November 1st.


107
0:8:4,639 --> 0:8:9,96
The issue is that the NHL has locked out its
players. The two sides are trying to negotiate


108
0:8:9,96 --> 0:8:15,289
a new contract for how they split up the money
that the league makes. So far, though, they


109
0:8:15,289 --> 0:8:21,289
haven`t been able to make a deal. 135 games
were scheduled between October 11th and November,


110
0:8:21,289 --> 0:8:28,639
1st. The last time the NHL had a lockout was
in 2004, and that year it was the entire season


111
0:8:28,639 --> 0:8:30,11
that ended up being canceled.


112
0:8:30,11 --> 0:8:33,729
We think you are going to get a kick out of
this next video, but we`ve got to set the


113
0:8:33,729 --> 0:8:39,3
scene for you. High school football game in
Spokane, Washington, two seconds left, team


114
0:8:39,3 --> 0:8:44,74
was down by three, coach sends in a kicker
to try a field goal. No pressure, right? Now,


115
0:8:44,74 --> 0:8:51,54
try this: it`s a 67 yard attempt. The kick
is up, but it`s got a long way to go. Watch


116
0:8:51,54 --> 0:8:51,889
this.


117
0:8:51,889 --> 0:8:52,97
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


118
0:8:52,97 --> 0:8:54,4
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Wow!


119
0:8:54,4 --> 0:8:55,829
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He mega kicked.


120
0:8:55,829 --> 0:8:56,899
(END VIDEO CLIP)


121
0:8:56,899 --> 0:9:4,23
AZUZ: Yes, he did. It`s good. 67 yards by
a high school senior. The NFL record is 63


122
0:9:4,23 --> 0:9:10,73
yards. The kick sent the game in overtime,
and the team would go on to win by a touchdown.


123
0:9:10,73 --> 0:9:14,98
And before we go, we are heading to a mountain
top in China, but that`s just a jumping off


124
0:9:14,98 --> 0:9:20,129
point for this story. It`s an international
wing suit flying competition. What`s a wing


125
0:9:20,129 --> 0:9:26,72
suit? That thing. It uses extra material between
the arms and legs to help with flight. The


126
0:9:26,72 --> 0:9:32,36
competitors had to fly a certain path through
a valley before popping open their parachutes.


127
0:9:32,36 --> 0:9:37,259
Fastest time to complete the course wins.
Though flying without an airplane might seem


128
0:9:37,259 --> 0:9:42,16
kind of crazy, those guys probably don`t spend
time nervously winging their hands about it.


129
0:9:42,16 --> 0:9:46,29
It suits them just fine. It`s time for us
to fly away on a wing and a prayer, but CNN


130
0:9:46,29 --> 0:11:46,29
STUDENT NEWS will be back tomorrow with your
debate coverage. I`m Carl Azuz. See you soon.
