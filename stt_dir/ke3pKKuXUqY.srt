0:0:14,384 --> 0:0:18,15
SHANE SMITH: So this is the
scene of a film that the


3
0:0:18,15 --> 0:0:20,32
General Kim Jong-Il directed?


4
0:0:20,32 --> 0:0:21,32
MR. KIM: Yes.


5
0:0:21,32 --> 0:0:25,244
He likes the film very much.


6
0:0:25,244 --> 0:0:28,54
SHANE SMITH: The first thing
you realize is this isn't a


7
0:0:28,54 --> 0:0:30,91
film studio, it's a museum.


8
0:0:30,91 --> 0:0:32,759
No one's making any
films here.


9
0:0:32,759 --> 0:0:34,48
It's yet another shrine
to this guy.

0:0:35,836 --> 0:1:26,214



12
0:1:26,214 --> 0:1:29,11
SHANE SMITH: So, the North
Koreans believe that he


13
0:1:29,11 --> 0:1:34,24
invented the whole concept of
multi-camera shoots in 1964.


14
0:1:34,24 --> 0:1:37,55
In fact, they believe he's so
great at making films that


15
0:1:37,55 --> 0:1:40,965
they made a film about how great
he is at making films.


16
0:1:40,965 --> 0:1:43,8
MALE SPEAKER: Visiting the
filming [INAUDIBLE]


17
0:1:43,8 --> 0:1:46,614
he taught the cameraman and
actors how to shoot and act.


18
0:1:46,614 --> 0:1:50,41



19
0:1:50,41 --> 0:1:54,3
This resulted in the creation of
masterpieces that teach man


20
0:1:54,3 --> 0:1:55,45
the truth of life and destiny.


21
0:1:55,45 --> 0:2:1,25



22
0:2:1,25 --> 0:2:3,63
SHANE SMITH: And my favorite
thing is, if you're a little


23
0:2:3,63 --> 0:2:6,86
unsure as to what exactly Kim
Jong-Il did on this film, what


24
0:2:6,86 --> 0:2:9,3
was his role, there's a list.

guidance how many times?

0:3:26,41 --> 0:3:29,946
The General Kim Jong-Il
came here 350 times.


40
0:3:29,946 --> 0:3:36,34
He gave 1,770 directions, but
also 11,890 guidances.

And these are all of those
things categorized here.


42
0:3:40,44 --> 0:3:43,807
I'm not going to ask what 8941
is, because when I asked what


43
0:3:43,807 --> 0:3:46,915
the 11890 was, it caused
quite a stir.


44
0:3:46,915 --> 0:3:51,62



45
0:3:51,62 --> 0:3:54,8
It's kind of like Twentieth
Century Fox or something.

0:3:57,8 --> 0:3:59,43
They took us rapidly from
room to room to room.


48
0:3:59,43 --> 0:4:2,15
Some rooms we could shoot,
some rooms we couldn't.


49
0:4:2,15 --> 0:4:3,16
I don't know why.


50
0:4:3,16 --> 0:4:5,9
We could shoot the camera room,
but we couldn't shoot


51

52
0:4:6,43 --> 0:4:7,45
No more shooting?

OK.

They've got recreations of their
meals that they used to

in the 1960s.

on-the-spot guidance with this

this camera here.

74

So I'm looking into the same
camera that the General Kim

And they'll have the saloon
and whatever.

This is their equivalent to
make Asian history films.

or American street?

101

We asked to see the European
street and the American street


102
0:6:16,84 --> 0:6:20,56
which they blow up when they
blow up America, but they


103
0:6:20,56 --> 0:6:21,35
won't let us see it.
