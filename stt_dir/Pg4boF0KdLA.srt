2
0:0:8,327 --> 0:0:14,567
<i>Storms sirens you name it,</i>
<i>Last night I didn't sleep,</i>


3
0:0:14,567 --> 0:0:20,367
<i>I guess I get a little goofy</i>
<i>when I'm nervous,</i>


4
0:0:20,367 --> 0:0:22,727
<i>You see today isn't just any other day,</i>


5
0:0:22,727 --> 0:0:24,87
<i>It's my first day,</i>


6
0:0:24,87 --> 0:0:34,407
l'm the man.

0:0:34,407 --> 0:0:37,527
<i>Three years of pre-med</i>
<i>and four years of med school</i>


8
0:0:37,527 --> 0:0:39,487
<i>have made me realise one thing,,,</i>


9
0:0:39,487 --> 0:0:42,607
Could you drop an NG tube
on the patient in 234


10
0:0:42,607 --> 0:0:44,487
and then call the attending?


11
0:0:44,487 --> 0:1:2,727
<i>,,,I don't know Jack,</i>


12
0:1:2,727 --> 0:1:4,327
<i>So this is my story,</i>


13
0:1:4,327 --> 0:1:8,87
- l'm supposed to be in intensive care.
- We just turfed him there.


14
0:1:8,87 --> 0:1:11,807
<i>I became a doctor to help people</i>
<i>but orientation yesterday</i>


15
0:1:11,807 --> 0:1:14,447
<i>didn't really focus on patient care,</i>


16
0:1:14,447 --> 0:1:16,367
The hospital doesn't wanna be sued.


17
0:1:16,367 --> 0:1:18,487
Being sued is not a good thing.


18
0:1:18,487 --> 0:1:20,407
- Hey, Turk?
- What's up?


19
0:1:20,407 --> 0:1:22,727
You know how l'm down
with the rap music?


20
0:1:22,727 --> 0:1:26,367
Dude, be whiter.


21
0:1:26,367 --> 0:1:30,767
<i>Chris Turk's my best friend, We roomed</i>
<i>together in college and med school,</i>


22
0:1:30,767 --> 0:1:35,207
<i>We even got accepted</i>
<i>by the same hospital,</i>


23
0:1:35,207 --> 0:1:37,807
Here's the thing. Tupac, DMX, Dr Dre,


24
0:1:37,807 --> 0:1:41,767
in most of their songs, they use
an extremely volatile racial slur.


25
0:1:41,767 --> 0:1:43,567
- The ''N'' word.
- l got it.


26
0:1:43,567 --> 0:1:46,647
My question is this:
if we're both singing along,


27
0:1:46,647 --> 0:1:49,167
and l would
never use the word otherwise,


28
0:1:49,167 --> 0:1:51,367
- am l allowed to say...
- No.


29
0:1:51,367 --> 0:1:53,647
That's good for me to know.


30
0:1:53,647 --> 0:1:59,127
Finally, doctors, if there is a mistake,
don't admit it to the patient.


31
0:1:59,127 --> 0:2:4,247
Of course, if the patient is deceased,
and you're sure,


32
0:2:4,247 --> 0:2:12,927
you can feel free to tell
him or her anything.


33
0:2:12,927 --> 0:2:14,487
l found us an apartment.


34
0:2:14,487 --> 0:2:19,487
OK, gang, l'm Dr Bob Kelso,
and l'm your Chief of Medicine,


35
0:2:19,487 --> 0:2:23,727
so l just want to encourage you all
to think of me as your safety net.


36
0:2:23,727 --> 0:2:27,607
Because l promise you,
we're a family here.


37
0:2:27,607 --> 0:2:30,807
Now, then, go get 'em, doctors.


38
0:2:30,807 --> 0:2:33,567
The surgical interns
are gonna go grab a beer.


39
0:2:33,567 --> 0:2:38,167
The medical interns are having
a Pac-Man tournament. We're all twelve.


40
0:2:38,167 --> 0:2:39,727
l love Pac-Man.


41
0:2:39,727 --> 0:2:44,847
Me, too. l love watching it,
l love playing it, l love all of it.


42
0:2:44,847 --> 0:2:47,487
- l'm Elliot.
- Ell-i-ot.


43
0:2:47,487 --> 0:2:49,7
Don't do that.


44
0:2:49,7 --> 0:2:51,287
l'm JD. This is Turk.


45
0:2:51,287 --> 0:2:53,367
Are you medical or surgical?


46
0:2:53,367 --> 0:2:55,687
Medical.


47
0:2:55,687 --> 0:2:57,447
<i>Hello,</i>


48
0:2:57,447 --> 0:3:1,727
Every male in my family is a doctor.
That's why Dad gave me a guy's name,


49
0:3:1,727 --> 0:3:4,167
made me play sports, date girls. Joking.


50
0:3:4,167 --> 0:3:7,767
l know.
l would've laughed if you'd paused.


51
0:3:7,767 --> 0:3:9,367
l know what you're thinking.


52
0:3:9,367 --> 0:3:12,167
<i>Your butt looks like</i>
<i>two Pringles hugging,</i>


53
0:3:12,167 --> 0:3:15,87
- No, you don't.
- l'm Miss ''Hyper-Competitive.''


54
0:3:15,87 --> 0:3:22,167
lt used to be a big problem for me.
Used to. Past tense.


55
0:3:22,167 --> 0:3:23,927
Are we racing?


56
0:3:23,927 --> 0:3:25,327
Yes!


57
0:3:25,327 --> 0:3:31,407
<i>I'm not that desperate,</i>


58
0:3:31,407 --> 0:3:50,527
No!


59
0:3:50,527 --> 0:3:52,87
You do a lot of cardio?


60
0:3:52,87 --> 0:3:53,567
Oh, yes.


61
0:3:53,567 --> 0:3:55,607
Elliot Reid? John Dorian? Great.


62
0:3:55,607 --> 0:3:58,847
One, l am your resident,
Dr Jeffrey Steadman. Not ''Jeff''.


63
0:3:58,847 --> 0:4:0,567
Two, here are your manuals.


64
0:4:0,567 --> 0:4:3,87
<i>Notice how quickly people</i>
<i>make an impression?</i>


65
0:4:3,87 --> 0:4:5,807
l am a tool. l am a tool.
l am a tool, tool, tool.


66
0:4:5,807 --> 0:4:8,407
- An unbelievably annoying tool.
- Yeah.


67
0:4:8,407 --> 0:4:12,47
These are your beepers.
From now on, they control your life.


68
0:4:12,47 --> 0:4:13,487
Thanks. Move it.


69
0:4:13,487 --> 0:4:15,407
<i>Back to today,</i>


70
0:4:15,407 --> 0:4:18,687
- l was paged.
- First day, Bambi?


71
0:4:18,687 --> 0:4:21,247
Don't look at me
when we're moving someone.


72
0:4:21,247 --> 0:4:23,927
Why?


73
0:4:23,927 --> 0:4:26,487
- We're waiting for Dr Cox.
- Hi, doctor...


74
0:4:26,487 --> 0:4:28,887
- Place an lV for me.
- We'll talk later.


75
0:4:28,887 --> 0:4:33,607
Carla, do you spray the perfume on
or fill your bathtub up


76
0:4:33,607 --> 0:4:36,167
- and splash around in it?
- l smell nice.


77
0:4:36,167 --> 0:4:38,767
<i>You've done this to cadavers,</i>
<i>He's alive,</i>


78
0:4:38,767 --> 0:4:40,727
<i>Poke it through his skin, Now!</i>


79
0:4:40,727 --> 0:4:44,207
Time's up.
Carla, will you do it for him?


80
0:4:44,207 --> 0:4:46,127
- Why tell her?
- Shut up and watch.


81
0:4:46,127 --> 0:4:47,447
Be nice to Bambi.


82
0:4:47,447 --> 0:4:50,767
Why's he got to try and die
every day during my lunch?


83
0:4:50,767 --> 0:4:52,967
That's insensitive.


84
0:4:52,967 --> 0:4:54,447
<i>Mistake,</i>


85
0:4:54,447 --> 0:4:57,327
Man's 92, has dementia,
doesn't know we're here.


86
0:4:57,327 --> 0:5:0,167
He is inches from Carla's rack
and hasn't flinched.


87
0:5:0,167 --> 0:5:3,127
- That is so sweet.
- Yeah, it is.


88
0:5:3,127 --> 0:5:6,127
What about his subconscious?


89
0:5:6,127 --> 0:5:11,7
Eisenhower was a sissy.


90
0:5:11,7 --> 0:5:13,407
l think we're gonna be OK.


91
0:5:13,407 --> 0:5:16,327
From now on,
whenever l'm in the room,


92
0:5:16,327 --> 0:5:21,127
you're definitely not allowed to talk.


93
0:5:21,127 --> 0:5:25,87
Dr Dorian, can you tell me
what ailment most often...


94
0:5:25,87 --> 0:5:28,287
<i>Rounds is like being on a game show,</i>


95
0:5:28,287 --> 0:5:29,367
What is uraemia?


96
0:5:29,367 --> 0:5:34,687
That's my boy. Nice clean job
on the Foley catheter.


97
0:5:34,687 --> 0:5:39,687
<i>I had a nurse do it,</i>
<i>I'm still afraid to touch anybody,</i>


98
0:5:39,687 --> 0:5:42,647
<i>I've been thinking a lot about Elliot,</i>
<i>A whole lot,</i>


99
0:5:42,647 --> 0:5:44,967
Dr Reid, you're late.


100
0:5:44,967 --> 0:5:46,807
l got puked on.


101
0:5:46,807 --> 0:5:51,167
You're off the hook if you can tell me
what to look for in a uraemic patient.


102
0:5:51,167 --> 0:5:52,887
<i>Anyway I'm going for it,</i>


103
0:5:52,887 --> 0:5:55,7
- lnfection.
- lnfection?


104
0:5:55,7 --> 0:5:57,887
That's my girl.


105
0:5:57,887 --> 0:5:59,527
Moving on.


106
0:5:59,527 --> 0:6:1,487
- l knew the answer.
- l'm sure you did.


107
0:6:1,487 --> 0:6:4,167
- l'm just frazzled.
- How could you not be?


108
0:6:4,167 --> 0:6:6,447
lf there's anything
l can do for you...


109
0:6:6,447 --> 0:6:10,47
You could let me take you to dinner
tomorrow night.


110
0:6:10,47 --> 0:6:12,127
Around seven?


111
0:6:12,127 --> 0:6:13,487
Or eight?


112
0:6:13,487 --> 0:6:15,447
Why not?


113
0:6:15,447 --> 0:6:16,807
Nice!


114
0:6:16,807 --> 0:6:19,727
<i>''Why not?'' That's what she said,</i>


115
0:6:19,727 --> 0:6:21,567
<i>''Why not?''</i>


116
0:6:21,567 --> 0:6:23,727
<i>Daddy why did you marry Mommy?</i>


117
0:6:23,727 --> 0:6:26,367
<i>Tiger I gave her</i>
<i>an answer during rounds</i>


118
0:6:26,367 --> 0:6:29,367
<i>and she screwed my brains out,</i>


119
0:6:29,367 --> 0:6:41,247
<i>You're the man,</i>


120
0:6:41,247 --> 0:6:45,7
<i>What the hell are you doing?</i>


121
0:6:45,7 --> 0:6:46,847
Did you actually just page me


122
0:6:46,847 --> 0:6:49,967
to find out how much Tylenol
to give to Mrs Lenzer?


123
0:6:49,967 --> 0:6:52,127
l was worried
it could exacerbate...


124
0:6:52,127 --> 0:6:55,967
lt's regular-strength Tylenol.
Here's what you do.


125
0:6:55,967 --> 0:6:59,167
Open her mouth,
take a handful and throw it at her.


126
0:6:59,167 --> 0:7:1,847
Whatever sticks,
that's the correct dosage.


127
0:7:1,847 --> 0:7:5,887
Under no circumstances are you to
compromise our no-talking agreement.


128
0:7:5,887 --> 0:7:8,327
Dr Kelso is always saying...


129
0:7:8,327 --> 0:7:11,407
l'm gonna say this
as carefully as possible,


130
0:7:11,407 --> 0:7:13,7
so l don't overstate it.


131
0:7:13,7 --> 0:7:16,847
Dr Kelso is the most evil
human being on the planet


132
0:7:16,847 --> 0:7:20,327
and may in fact be Satan himself.


133
0:7:20,327 --> 0:7:23,7
lt's just that this isn't
what l expected.


134
0:7:23,7 --> 0:7:26,567
Most of my patients are...


135
0:7:26,567 --> 0:7:30,727
older and sorta
checked-out, mentally.


136
0:7:30,727 --> 0:7:33,807
Pumpkin, that's modern medicine.


137
0:7:33,807 --> 0:7:38,647
Advances that keep people alive
who should've died a long time ago.


138
0:7:38,647 --> 0:7:41,127
Back when they lost
what made them people.


139
0:7:41,127 --> 0:7:45,447
Your job is to stay sane enough so when
someone does come in that you can help,


140
0:7:45,447 --> 0:7:47,887
you're not so braindead
you can't function.


141
0:7:47,887 --> 0:7:51,47
For the love of God, what?


142
0:7:51,47 --> 0:7:54,47
Should we be talking
about this in front of...


143
0:7:54,47 --> 0:7:56,127
Her? She's dead.


144
0:7:56,127 --> 0:7:58,767
Write this down.
lf you push around a stiff,


145
0:7:58,767 --> 0:8:1,807
nobody'll ask you to do anything.


146
0:8:1,807 --> 0:8:3,687
You've been like a father to me.


147
0:8:3,687 --> 0:8:7,287
lf they find out
nurses are doing your procedures,


148
0:8:7,287 --> 0:8:10,207
you'll be kicked out so quick,
your head'll spin.


149
0:8:10,207 --> 0:8:11,527
<i>And there it is,</i>


150
0:8:11,527 --> 0:8:17,647
Have a terrific day.


151
0:8:17,647 --> 0:8:19,927
l'm not really dead.


152
0:8:19,927 --> 0:8:22,447
Bambi, here's Mrs Lenzer's tox screen.


153
0:8:22,447 --> 0:8:24,967
<i>Is Turk having</i>
<i>the same experience I am?</i>


154
0:8:24,967 --> 0:8:27,287
- l am such a stud.
- <i>Probably not,</i>


155
0:8:27,287 --> 0:8:30,87
l had my hands
inside of a guy's chest.


156
0:8:30,87 --> 0:8:34,407
l couldn't even see them. l should not
be allowed to do stuff like that.

0:8:34,407 --> 0:8:36,87
Wassup?


158
0:8:36,87 --> 0:8:38,487
- You weren't scared?
- One way or another,


159
0:8:38,487 --> 0:8:40,47
everyone stops bleeding.


160
0:8:40,47 --> 0:8:42,327
- That is so deep.
- No, it isn't.


161
0:8:42,327 --> 0:8:43,607
lt's a little deep.


162
0:8:43,607 --> 0:8:48,687
- About the apartment...
- T-Man!


163
0:8:48,687 --> 0:8:50,287
Word up, boy, how you doing?


164
0:8:50,287 --> 0:8:51,847
- All right.
- Todd, JD.


165
0:8:51,847 --> 0:8:55,807

0:9:17,287 --> 0:9:22,607
To see if your gas
could be harmful to others.

0:9:22,607 --> 0:9:25,7
<i>He's just scared, Talk to him,</i>


175
0:9:25,7 --> 0:9:29,87
Look, Mr Burski, l heard
a systolic murmur in your heart,

0:9:29,87 --> 0:9:32,407
which is most likely nothing,
but if l don't check you out,


177
0:9:32,407 --> 0:9:35,807
- l'll worry about you all day.
- Then l'll do it. For you.

You're a good man.

0:9:44,47 --> 0:9:46,727
l'm waiting for someone.


180
0:9:46,727 --> 0:9:50,807
The door is broke. Probably
the fifth time or so it don't open.


181
0:9:50,807 --> 0:9:52,607
Maybe a penny's stuck in there.


182
0:9:52,607 --> 0:9:55,247
- Why a penny?
- l don't know.


183
0:9:55,247 --> 0:9:58,567

188
0:10:10,407 --> 0:10:19,927
The necrosis and infected stool
most likely indicate what, Dr Dorian?


189
0:10:19,927 --> 0:10:22,207
l don't know.


190
0:10:22,207 --> 0:10:24,7
Sir, l have no idea.


191
0:10:24,7 --> 0:10:26,47
Dr Reid, can you help him out?


192
0:10:26,47 --> 0:10:31,567
Superior mesenteric insufficiency.


193
0:10:31,567 --> 0:10:36,167
That's my girl.
Patient number two.


194
0:10:36,167 --> 0:10:42,47
''Superior mesenteric...''


195
0:10:42,47 --> 0:10:44,887
<i>Draining stomach fluid</i>
<i>will get my spirits up,</i>


196
0:10:44,887 --> 0:10:47,847
- Circles for you.
- Shut up and do it.


197
0:10:47,847 --> 0:10:52,607
<i>Fantastic, Now just suck out the fluid</i>
<i>with the giant needle,</i>


198
0:10:52,607 --> 0:10:54,687
Needle's too big.
l'm gonna get a nurse.


199
0:10:54,687 --> 0:10:58,847
Come on, man. Learn by doing.


200
0:10:58,847 --> 0:11:4,687
<i>Why couldn't I do that?</i>
<i>I hated him at that moment,</i>


201
0:11:4,687 --> 0:11:7,247
OK, maybe the needle
was a little too big.


202
0:11:7,247 --> 0:11:9,527
- You think?
- What's going on?


203
0:11:9,527 --> 0:11:12,887
Nothing. This is totally normal.


204
0:11:12,887 --> 0:11:15,47
So are you gonna
move your stuff in?


205
0:11:15,47 --> 0:11:18,767
That's why l came by. l think it's
better if we both branched out.


206
0:11:18,767 --> 0:11:21,567
<i>Tell him that's stupid,</i>
<i>Tell him you need him,</i>


207
0:11:21,567 --> 0:11:30,287
l feel the same way.


208
0:11:30,287 --> 0:11:33,127
What's it like
being a young hotshot doctor?


209
0:11:33,127 --> 0:11:36,407
Did you ever go see a movie
everyone told you was great


210
0:11:36,407 --> 0:11:40,127
and because of all the expectations,
you were disappointed?


211
0:11:40,127 --> 0:11:43,47
Movies nowadays
have too many special effects.


212
0:11:43,47 --> 0:11:45,607
That was my point.


213
0:11:45,607 --> 0:11:49,367
<i>My first code, Someone's heart fails</i>
<i>they beep everyone,</i>


214
0:11:49,367 --> 0:11:51,767
<i>The first doctor in</i>
<i>has to run the room</i>


215
0:11:51,767 --> 0:11:54,127
<i>decides if a patient lives or dies,</i>


216
0:11:54,127 --> 0:11:58,487
<i>What am I crazy?</i>


217
0:11:58,487 --> 0:12:0,567
You chicken.


218
0:12:0,567 --> 0:12:3,807
<i>Don't worry,</i>
<i>Turk was there ''learning by doing'',</i>


219
0:12:3,807 --> 0:12:7,887
- Charged.
- Clear.


220
0:12:7,887 --> 0:12:11,87
<i>The guy was just sleeping</i>
<i>attached to a faulty monitor,</i>


221
0:12:11,87 --> 0:12:13,7
l thought we cared for each other.


222
0:12:13,7 --> 0:12:15,247
You just wanna sleep with me.


223
0:12:15,247 --> 0:12:19,647
l don't wanna sleep with you now.


224
0:12:19,647 --> 0:12:22,47
Do me right here.


225
0:12:22,47 --> 0:12:25,567
See?


226
0:12:25,567 --> 0:12:29,487
Right. Pass me a trach kit.


227
0:12:29,487 --> 0:12:32,407
Thanks.


228
0:12:32,407 --> 0:12:39,7
Our date is totally cancelled.


229
0:12:39,7 --> 0:12:41,487
<i>I was sitting on the floor</i>
<i>for two reasons,</i>


230
0:12:41,487 --> 0:12:45,607
<i>One I tried to lock Elliot in that</i>
<i>supply closet and she kicked me, Hard,</i>


231
0:12:45,607 --> 0:12:49,7
<i>And two the on-call room was locked,</i>


232
0:12:49,7 --> 0:12:52,207
Come on,
l got ten minutes to sleep.


233
0:12:52,207 --> 0:12:53,287
Wait.


234
0:12:53,287 --> 0:12:55,447
Tell me if l'm going too fast, OK?


235
0:12:55,447 --> 0:13:0,7
Lose the clothes.


236
0:13:0,7 --> 0:13:2,287
<i>I heard Turk</i>
<i>was gonna move in with Todd,</i>


237
0:13:2,287 --> 0:13:5,287
<i>I'm surprised that freak</i>
<i>isn't in there with him,</i>


238
0:13:5,287 --> 0:13:8,447
Damn, this is hot.


239
0:13:8,447 --> 0:13:9,767
Nice.


240
0:13:9,767 --> 0:13:11,167
Your turn.


241
0:13:11,167 --> 0:13:15,567
No, l gotta get back,
but very nice.


242
0:13:15,567 --> 0:13:18,47
Hey, Bambi.


243
0:13:18,47 --> 0:13:20,727
l'll call you, OK?


244
0:13:20,727 --> 0:13:22,407
Give me a big ''ahh''.


245
0:13:22,407 --> 0:13:24,447
A big-boy ''ahh''.


246
0:13:24,447 --> 0:13:26,647
Turk almost had sex
in the on-call room.


247
0:13:26,647 --> 0:13:29,807
You realise, of course,
l have no idea who Turk is,


248
0:13:29,807 --> 0:13:32,47
but good for him.


249
0:13:32,47 --> 0:13:36,607
You see, Billy, it turns out
that sex is life-affirming.


250
0:13:36,607 --> 0:13:39,207
What do you say?
Got a urine sample for me?


251
0:13:39,207 --> 0:13:41,7
l just did five minutes ago.


252
0:13:41,7 --> 0:13:42,887
But here's the thing.


253
0:13:42,887 --> 0:13:47,607
Take this, put it on the ground, close
your eyes and go nuts. What do you say?


254
0:13:47,607 --> 0:13:51,127
- Cool!
- Attaboy. Go get 'em.


255
0:13:51,127 --> 0:13:53,687
- Why are you here?
- Seems like a good kid.


256
0:13:53,687 --> 0:13:56,287
You're worried
about being on call tonight.


257
0:13:56,287 --> 0:13:58,127
<i>Yeah,</i>


258
0:13:58,127 --> 0:14:1,407
Look, worst-case scenario,


259
0:14:1,407 --> 0:14:2,927
you kill somebody,


260
0:14:2,927 --> 0:14:5,367
and it's with you
the rest of your life.


261
0:14:5,367 --> 0:14:8,287
But that is the absolute
worst-case scenario.


262
0:14:8,287 --> 0:14:11,527
Just have the nurses do the stuff
you're too chicken to do,


263
0:14:11,527 --> 0:14:15,127
which is everything, and if you
have a really rough admission...


264
0:14:15,127 --> 0:14:16,287
Call you?


265
0:14:16,287 --> 0:14:19,647
No! Hide in the closet again.


266
0:14:19,647 --> 0:14:21,127
This is fun.


267
0:14:21,127 --> 0:14:23,167
- Nurse?
- l'm a doctor.


268
0:14:23,167 --> 0:14:26,127
The stethoscope, the beeper,
a doctor, got it?


269
0:14:26,127 --> 0:14:27,327
Relax.


270
0:14:27,327 --> 0:14:29,807
l hate the ''darlings'',
the ''sweethearts''.


271
0:14:29,807 --> 0:14:32,967
No need to tell me how hard it is
being a woman here.


272
0:14:32,967 --> 0:14:38,687
You're helping by wearing a thong
and hooking up in the on-call room.


273
0:14:38,687 --> 0:14:39,887
Word gets around.


274
0:14:39,887 --> 0:14:42,327
You talk like that,
do you even know my name?


275
0:14:42,327 --> 0:14:46,127
l spend every second of my life
either here or taking care of my mom,


276
0:14:46,127 --> 0:14:48,927
so, yeah,
maybe l needed a little closeness.


277
0:14:48,927 --> 0:14:51,287
You never had a quickie
at the club, right?


278
0:14:51,287 --> 0:14:54,727
Or snuck some skinny college boy
up to your sorority room.


279
0:14:54,727 --> 0:14:57,727
And my thong?
l think it makes my ass look good.


280
0:14:57,727 --> 0:15:0,447
And some days, l need
to feel good about something.


281
0:15:0,447 --> 0:15:2,887
And you judge me?
Well, guess what?


282
0:15:2,887 --> 0:15:5,567
Word does get around,
Ms Out-For-Herself.


283
0:15:5,567 --> 0:15:14,167
So you can dump on everyone here
if you want, but you will not hurt me.


284
0:15:14,167 --> 0:15:32,167
Her name's Carla, by the way.


285
0:15:32,167 --> 0:15:36,727
Hey, champ.
First night on call starts soon, huh?


286
0:15:36,727 --> 0:15:39,527
You must be excited.


287
0:15:39,527 --> 0:15:40,847
You betcha.


288
0:15:40,847 --> 0:15:44,407
About Mrs Pratt.


289
0:15:44,407 --> 0:15:48,207
l heard you wanted to put her
on the hospital's transplant list.


290
0:15:48,207 --> 0:15:51,607
l'd recommend
keeping her on dialysis a little longer.


291
0:15:51,607 --> 0:15:54,7
- Maybe we'll get lucky.
- No problem, sir.


292
0:15:54,7 --> 0:15:55,887
Great. Have a ball.


293
0:15:55,887 --> 0:15:57,607
On call.


294
0:15:57,607 --> 0:16:44,167
Little poem for ya.


295
0:16:44,167 --> 0:16:53,687
Bambi, let's go.


296
0:16:53,687 --> 0:16:57,167
l'll check on you every ten minutes,
Mrs Marino, OK?


297
0:16:57,167 --> 0:16:59,247
l need to see you in Mr Burski's room.


298
0:16:59,247 --> 0:17:2,207
Are you flirting with me?


299
0:17:2,207 --> 0:17:5,767
You are, aren't you?


300
0:17:5,767 --> 0:17:9,527
He crashed. The attending
thinks it was a pulmonary embolism.


301
0:17:9,527 --> 0:17:11,727
No way anyone could've caught it.


302
0:17:11,727 --> 0:17:14,887
- You have to pronounce him.
- Why didn't anybody page me?


303
0:17:14,887 --> 0:17:18,287
Could you just pronounce him
so l can go home?


304
0:17:18,287 --> 0:17:20,687
<i>I'll never forget that moment,</i>


305
0:17:20,687 --> 0:17:23,287
<i>The way he looked exactly the same</i>


306
0:17:23,287 --> 0:17:26,607
<i>only completely different,</i>


307
0:17:26,607 --> 0:17:34,47
<i>The shame that all I could think about</i>
<i>was how hard this was for me,</i>


308
0:17:34,47 --> 0:17:39,807
Time of death 0200.


309
0:17:39,807 --> 0:17:42,527
<i>I just wanted to help people,</i>


310
0:17:42,527 --> 0:17:45,527
<i>The hardest part is how quickly</i>
<i>you have to move on,</i>


311
0:17:45,527 --> 0:17:50,87
Don't worry, you're gonna be fine.


312
0:17:50,87 --> 0:17:53,7
l lied before.
l'm scared every second.


313
0:17:53,7 --> 0:17:55,207
Really?


314
0:17:55,207 --> 0:17:58,447
lt's a good thing they make
surgical masks. lf they didn't,


315
0:17:58,447 --> 0:18:3,87
everyone would know my face
was like this the whole time.


316
0:18:3,87 --> 0:18:6,47
l think it's OK to be scared.


317
0:18:6,47 --> 0:18:8,207
l need you to tell me that.


318
0:18:8,207 --> 0:18:9,647
<i>He needs me?</i>


319
0:18:9,647 --> 0:18:13,327
l just came to check up on you,
see how you're doing.


320
0:18:13,327 --> 0:18:15,7
<i>Ask him to move in again,</i>


321
0:18:15,7 --> 0:18:17,647
Turk, the offer still stands...


322
0:18:17,647 --> 0:18:21,967
l already took the keys
out your bag.


323
0:18:21,967 --> 0:18:27,167
l love you.


324
0:18:27,167 --> 0:18:33,567
<i>And like that I got a second wind,</i>


325
0:18:33,567 --> 0:18:42,207
l'm watching you.


326
0:18:42,207 --> 0:18:45,407
- How you holding up?
- <i>There he is, My safety net,</i>


327
0:18:45,407 --> 0:18:50,167
l saw that you're still pushing to put
Mrs Pratt on the transplant list.


328
0:18:50,167 --> 0:18:54,447
Bad news, though. She doesn't
have the insurance to cover it.


329
0:18:54,447 --> 0:18:57,567
But she's a second away
from total renal failure.


330
0:18:57,567 --> 0:18:59,407
OK...


331
0:18:59,407 --> 0:19:3,447
Did you ask the Burski family
for permission to do an autopsy?


332
0:19:3,447 --> 0:19:5,47
They're still with him.


333
0:19:5,47 --> 0:19:8,287
lt's a teaching hospital,
you gotta ask.


334
0:19:8,287 --> 0:19:11,487
<i>Tell him you can't see</i>
<i>Mr Burski again he'll understand,</i>


335
0:19:11,487 --> 0:19:14,287
Sir, do you think l could skip
just this one?


336
0:19:14,287 --> 0:19:16,687
Why, sure, sport.


337
0:19:16,687 --> 0:19:19,927
<i>See? Every story needs a good guy,</i>


338
0:19:19,927 --> 0:19:23,847
ln fact, why don't you
just head on home?


339
0:19:23,847 --> 0:19:25,847
You look kinda tired.


340
0:19:25,847 --> 0:19:28,87
l am pretty tired.


341
0:19:28,87 --> 0:19:31,447
Dr Dorian, do you not realise


342
0:19:31,447 --> 0:19:35,887
that you're nothing but
a large pair of scrubs to me?


343
0:19:35,887 --> 0:19:38,287
The only reason
l carry this chart around


344
0:19:38,287 --> 0:19:40,767
is so l can pretend to remember
your names.


345
0:19:40,767 --> 0:19:43,847
lf the patient has insurance,
you treat them.


346
0:19:43,847 --> 0:19:46,287
lf they don't,
you show them the door.


347
0:19:46,287 --> 0:19:49,7
And if somebody dies,
you get the autopsy.


348
0:19:49,7 --> 0:19:53,607
Get it by rounds tomorrow or l'll
scratch your name off my chart. Clear?


349
0:19:53,607 --> 0:19:55,767
Answer me!


350
0:19:55,767 --> 0:19:57,927
Crystal clear.


351
0:19:57,927 --> 0:20:2,367
Great, sport.


352
0:20:2,367 --> 0:20:5,487
<i>If he's the jerk,,,</i>


353
0:20:5,487 --> 0:20:8,407
<i>,,,then who's the good guy?</i>


354
0:20:8,407 --> 0:20:10,967
Car accident.
Crashed on the way up.


355
0:20:10,967 --> 0:20:13,527
Relieve the pressure on his chest.
JD, do it.


356
0:20:13,527 --> 0:20:14,847
<i>God no,</i>


357
0:20:14,847 --> 0:20:16,767
Look at me. You can do this.


358
0:20:16,767 --> 0:20:19,807
- <i>And I believed him,</i>
- Chest tube tray.


359
0:20:19,807 --> 0:20:21,127
<i>You know kind of,</i>


360
0:20:21,127 --> 0:20:23,207
Come on, baby, let's go.


361
0:20:23,207 --> 0:20:26,247
<i>You can do this,</i>
<i>You have to do this,</i>


362
0:20:26,247 --> 0:20:28,727
JD, cut him or lose him.


363
0:20:28,727 --> 0:20:34,7
Give me the tube.


364
0:20:34,7 --> 0:20:35,767
l can't get through the pleura.


365
0:20:35,767 --> 0:20:38,967
Don't be gentle, get it in there.


366
0:20:38,967 --> 0:20:44,447
Connect it, please, Carla.


367
0:20:44,447 --> 0:20:46,687
- Normal rhythm.
- No way!


368
0:20:46,687 --> 0:20:49,847
lt's a piece of cake.
lt's your patient.


369
0:20:49,847 --> 0:20:52,727
You're leaving?


370
0:20:52,727 --> 0:20:59,47
That's your patient, doctor.


371
0:20:59,47 --> 0:21:0,487
Good.


372
0:21:0,487 --> 0:21:2,567
- That's enough.
- Sorry.


373
0:21:2,567 --> 0:21:4,647
lt's a very big moment for me.


374
0:21:4,647 --> 0:21:9,7
<i>I guess that's it for now,</i>
<i>3 1 hours 1 2 minutes and I am,,,</i>


375
0:21:9,7 --> 0:21:10,687
You finally off?


376
0:21:10,687 --> 0:21:13,647
Almost. l have one more
annoying thing l gotta do.


377
0:21:13,647 --> 0:21:16,487
lf it's the Burski autopsy,
l called the family


378
0:21:16,487 --> 0:21:19,487
and they said fine,
and to thank you, and l'm sorry.


379
0:21:19,487 --> 0:21:21,767
They didn't say that last part,
l did.


380
0:21:21,767 --> 0:21:26,207
<i>The worst part was knowing</i>
<i>I could never forgive her,</i>


381
0:21:26,207 --> 0:21:28,287
<i>I forgive her,</i>


382
0:21:28,287 --> 0:21:30,487
<i>You see I can't survive on my own,</i>


383
0:21:30,487 --> 0:21:33,447
l'm a dork. A dork. l'm a dork.


384
0:21:33,447 --> 0:21:35,527
<i>Even now</i>
<i>when I get to go home</i>


385
0:21:35,527 --> 0:21:38,407
<i>I'll know the hospital's still here</i>
<i>wide awake,</i>


386
0:21:38,407 --> 0:21:41,887
Get out while you still can.


387
0:21:41,887 --> 0:21:43,407
<i>But what the hell,</i>


388
0:21:43,407 --> 0:21:46,367
<i>The important thing is</i>
<i>I got through my first three days</i>


389
0:21:46,367 --> 0:21:52,7
<i>without looking</i>
<i>like a complete idiot,</i>


390
0:21:52,7 --> 0:23:52,7
<i>I'm the man,</i>
