1
0:0:0,22 --> 0:0:4,279
frank part knowing jesse i zinger had a
terrific piece in the land scroll what's


2
0:0:4,279 --> 0:0:6,5
inside america's backs


3
0:0:6,5 --> 0:0:7,51
and and


4
0:0:7,51 --> 0:0:9,579
you see some devastating effects


5
0:0:9,579 --> 0:0:13,519
first of all america's get it they don't
trust the banks in fact


6
0:0:13,519 --> 0:0:17,859
only twenty-one percent respondents said
that they have faith index now of course


7
0:0:17,859 --> 0:0:19,64
again


8
0:0:19,64 --> 0:0:23,899
among are uh... powerful that people in
new york in washington the politicians


9
0:0:23,899 --> 0:0:25,71
in the media


10
0:0:25,71 --> 0:0:29,65
salomon bank so some issues but you know
the rock solid and we did the stress


11
0:0:29,65 --> 0:0:30,67
that's they're fine


12
0:0:30,67 --> 0:0:32,16
well we're not buying it


13
0:0:32,16 --> 0:0:34,21
and were right as your about to see


14
0:0:34,21 --> 0:0:36,9
but what's interesting


15
0:0:36,9 --> 0:0:41,17
ok fine american people are by but
neither are the investors


16
0:0:41,17 --> 0:0:44,999
now these are guys on wall street and
they don't wanna invest in the banks


17
0:0:44,999 --> 0:0:51,49
cuz they call the banks big black boxes
meaning we have no idea what's inside


18
0:0:51,49 --> 0:0:54,6
seventy nine percent of investors have
no or trust


19
0:0:54,6 --> 0:0:56,36
in the financial system


20
0:0:56,36 --> 0:0:59,19
is amazing


21
0:0:59,19 --> 0:1:3,97
seven nine percent of investors don't
believe in the backs


22
0:1:3,97 --> 0:1:5,29
it's not just


23
0:1:5,29 --> 0:1:8,7
investors it's not just that american
people to sanction the people who work


24
0:1:8,7 --> 0:1:9,91
for the banks to


25
0:1:9,91 --> 0:1:11,57
let me give you a list here


26
0:1:11,57 --> 0:1:15,4
four purcell axial morris family and
dean witter


27
0:1:15,4 --> 0:1:20,16
uh... or if you say morris a leading
winner sally project x c_f_o_ of


28
0:1:20,16 --> 0:1:21,9
citigroup


29
0:1:21,9 --> 0:1:26,29
david kamensky axial merrill lynch
jeremy former ceo citigroup sandy weill


30
0:1:26,29 --> 0:1:30,54
legendary former axia of citigroup
minnesota in the right way it's


31
0:1:30,54 --> 0:1:34,21
uh... but very well know one of the top
anchors in the country for a long time


32
0:1:34,21 --> 0:1:37,64
they have called for break-up of the big
banks tighter regulation


33
0:1:37,64 --> 0:1:42,27
and a return to glass steagle laws
'cause they all had been inside the


34
0:1:42,27 --> 0:1:47,1
banks they were on the banks and they
know they are loaded to explode if you


35
0:1:47,1 --> 0:1:49,68
don't get them under control if you
don't break them up


36
0:1:49,68 --> 0:1:52,33
bina destroy this economy


37
0:1:52,33 --> 0:1:56,0
they uh... how bad don young he's uh...
financial accounting standards


38
0:1:56,0 --> 0:1:57,84
board member that is a private group


39
0:1:57,84 --> 0:2:1,17
that's supposed to do the county status
for the backs


40
0:2:1,17 --> 0:2:3,15
after having served on the board


41
0:2:3,15 --> 0:2:5,25
don young says


42
0:2:5,25 --> 0:2:7,42
quote after serving on the board


43
0:2:7,42 --> 0:2:12,49
buying no longer trusts bank county


44
0:2:12,49 --> 0:2:14,69
now that's a guy incharge


45
0:2:14,69 --> 0:2:15,699
im bank accounting


46
0:2:15,699 --> 0:2:17,23
if you are a look at it


47
0:2:17,23 --> 0:2:20,46
and you're crazy if you trusted but he's
not alone and other board member of that


48
0:2:20,46 --> 0:2:22,47
same financially tennis tennis board


49
0:2:22,47 --> 0:2:23,659
and trot


50
0:2:23,659 --> 0:2:27,139
when asked do you trust bank accounting
said quote


51
0:2:27,139 --> 0:2:27,959
aps so


52
0:2:27,959 --> 0:2:29,93
loot lee not


53
0:2:29,93 --> 0:2:33,449
gee i wonder if they're set to explode


54
0:2:33,449 --> 0:2:36,899
buzzing of these writers did was they
looked into wells fargo


55
0:2:36,899 --> 0:2:40,469
now wells fargo supposed to be the most
conservative back there


56
0:2:40,469 --> 0:2:43,14
warren buffett has large ownership
interest in there


57
0:2:43,14 --> 0:2:46,559
and it's usually heralded as like boy
those guys on to the congress


58
0:2:46,559 --> 0:2:48,169
other crazy bankers


59
0:2:48,169 --> 0:2:51,309
orwell succinct so they look at them
disclosure forms


60
0:2:51,309 --> 0:2:55,49
but what they found out they were
incredibly they on purpose number two


61
0:2:55,49 --> 0:2:58,449
when steve got to the schools use in all
the different levels


62
0:2:58,449 --> 0:2:59,5
of uh...


63
0:2:59,5 --> 0:3:2,249
transactions they make it got scarier
scary


64
0:3:2,249 --> 0:3:4,749
so the court one part of the disclosure


65
0:3:4,749 --> 0:3:7,53
it was like us or customer accommodation


66
0:3:7,53 --> 0:3:9,749
now wait a minute


67
0:3:9,749 --> 0:3:10,86
this is


68
0:3:10,86 --> 0:3:13,59
a huge profit center for them


69
0:3:13,59 --> 0:3:17,659
how could customer commendation be such
a big profit center is that hey i helped


70
0:3:17,659 --> 0:3:19,239
a guy and with his


71
0:3:19,239 --> 0:3:22,659
checking account and we made money off
that no no no no no


72
0:3:22,659 --> 0:3:25,949
this is what they called setting the
market


73
0:3:25,949 --> 0:3:28,4
they accommodate the customers


74
0:3:28,4 --> 0:3:33,239
by doing tremendous amount of training
of derivatives on their own


75
0:3:33,239 --> 0:3:34,439
they can help set the market


76
0:3:34,439 --> 0:3:37,759
in fact they explain in their own is
going to forbes quote


77
0:3:37,759 --> 0:3:39,39
customer accommodation trading


78
0:3:39,39 --> 0:3:43,79
also includes net gains related to
market maybe activities


79
0:3:43,79 --> 0:3:45,39
in which we take positions


80
0:3:45,39 --> 0:3:46,589
to facilitate


81
0:3:46,589 --> 0:3:48,129
expect


82
0:3:48,129 --> 0:3:52,15
customer order flow


83
0:3:52,15 --> 0:3:55,49
why is that so important i might sound
complicated if you don't know


84
0:3:55,49 --> 0:3:58,419
about these disclosure


85
0:3:58,419 --> 0:4:0,37
because they're saying owner know


86
0:4:0,37 --> 0:4:5,17
which is market making you know gaya act
or tremendous investor paid well like


87
0:4:5,17 --> 0:4:9,31
the new deal which rests a tremendous
investor beat and it we just simply make


88
0:4:9,31 --> 0:4:12,569
that we'll have a if that's all they did
that would be understandable


89
0:4:12,569 --> 0:4:13,51
but they say


90
0:4:13,51 --> 0:4:14,689
we're doing this


91
0:4:14,689 --> 0:4:16,519
to facilitate x-spam


92
0:4:16,519 --> 0:4:18,53
the customer order fourteen other words


93
0:4:18,53 --> 0:4:20,809
the customers have not asked for that
trade


94
0:4:20,809 --> 0:4:23,199
they're doing that trade on their own


95
0:4:23,199 --> 0:4:26,869
and so if it blows up it blows up on
that


96
0:4:26,869 --> 0:4:29,539
but they have to find an excuse they can
just go out there and say well what


97
0:4:29,539 --> 0:4:30,21
we're doing


98
0:4:30,21 --> 0:4:32,77
hundreds of billions of dollars in his
you're about to see some


99
0:4:32,77 --> 0:4:35,669
some pieces try is always with a risky
trades


100
0:4:35,669 --> 0:4:39,259
for the bank by the way also using
customer money


101
0:4:39,259 --> 0:4:42,699
they have to say no it's expected
customer demand


102
0:4:42,699 --> 0:4:44,849
it's a joke


103
0:4:44,849 --> 0:4:48,219
of the writers found out that there was
three different levels of risk


104
0:4:48,219 --> 0:4:52,369
level one was understandable level to
that really scary and level three was


105
0:4:52,369 --> 0:4:53,399
instead


106
0:4:53,399 --> 0:4:55,33
let me sweat


107
0:4:55,33 --> 0:4:57,15
the banks level three estimates


108
0:4:57,15 --> 0:4:59,13
are generated primarily


109
0:4:59,13 --> 0:5:2,919
from model-based techniques that you
significant assumptions


110
0:5:2,919 --> 0:5:6,18
not to observable in the market


111
0:5:6,18 --> 0:5:8,62
okay let me decide without woodford


112
0:5:8,62 --> 0:5:12,409
so i said are we got all these level one
things and we keep we have some sense of


113
0:5:12,409 --> 0:5:15,36
how much they're worth level till we
don't have the as good a sense we're


114
0:5:15,36 --> 0:5:16,37
kind of guessing


115
0:5:16,37 --> 0:5:18,29
in this one


116
0:5:18,29 --> 0:5:21,389
all listen money that we have in these
transactions


117
0:5:21,389 --> 0:5:25,139
even though we tell everybody were point
totally financially sound


118
0:5:25,139 --> 0:5:29,629
we have no idea what their work


119
0:5:29,629 --> 0:5:31,96
we use in every year the substance


120
0:5:31,96 --> 0:5:35,39
of not observable in the market


121
0:5:35,39 --> 0:5:37,379
no i don't know what it means


122
0:5:37,379 --> 0:5:40,889
no one has any idea what they're worth


123
0:5:40,889 --> 0:5:44,39
now if u make a bet with a friend of
yours


124
0:5:44,39 --> 0:5:47,43
and if you lose the bet you don't know
how much you're gonna lose


125
0:5:47,43 --> 0:5:51,929
that would be an issue review lose ten
bucks you can lose a thousand straight


126
0:5:51,929 --> 0:5:54,759
it meant that really hurts every loss of
alesha box


127
0:5:54,759 --> 0:5:56,86
but they don't know the size of these
bats


128
0:5:56,86 --> 0:6:1,269
and they're not but that doesn't box
their bed trillions


129
0:6:1,269 --> 0:6:2,569
here we go


130
0:6:2,569 --> 0:6:3,76
now in the past


131
0:6:3,76 --> 0:6:5,249
companies like and ron


132
0:6:5,249 --> 0:6:6,219
did these


133
0:6:6,219 --> 0:6:8,8
tricky accounting things


134
0:6:8,8 --> 0:6:9,309
that too


135
0:6:9,309 --> 0:6:12,68
levels one through three or at least on
the books but they were newsome


136
0:6:12,68 --> 0:6:14,83
off the books transactions


137
0:6:14,83 --> 0:6:17,129
so became a little word for it


138
0:6:17,129 --> 0:6:20,12
special-purpose antique


139
0:6:20,12 --> 0:6:22,59
game in town the name right


140
0:6:22,59 --> 0:6:23,939
it's a special promise entity


141
0:6:23,939 --> 0:6:27,99
the special-purpose is the cheek
appstate it's i want to all of my box


142
0:6:27,99 --> 0:6:29,4
companies all of my books


143
0:6:29,4 --> 0:6:30,889
you're immediately realized


144
0:6:30,889 --> 0:6:33,89
i'm committing mass of fraud


145
0:6:33,89 --> 0:6:35,55
so now they don't do that that's
discredited


146
0:6:35,55 --> 0:6:39,839
they change the worst doing the same
exact thing but it's now called


147
0:6:39,839 --> 0:6:42,449
variable interest entity


148
0:6:42,449 --> 0:6:46,74
so it's off the books it's not even
level grades were some level three rest


149
0:6:46,74 --> 0:6:49,27
and what's the interest


150
0:6:49,27 --> 0:6:52,449
it's a variable interest entity


151
0:6:52,449 --> 0:6:55,619
okay but we're thinking okay


152
0:6:55,619 --> 0:7:0,68
but these guys have a lot of this error
for example wells fargo has it you know


153
0:7:0,68 --> 0:7:3,639
over a hundred forty billion dollars in
cash from the start that sounds like a


154
0:7:3,639 --> 0:7:4,809
lot right


155
0:7:4,809 --> 0:7:9,479
well it's not so much when you find out
just their variable interest entities


156
0:7:9,479 --> 0:7:11,289
coalescence our


157
0:7:11,289 --> 0:7:15,68
one point four six trillion dollars


158
0:7:15,68 --> 0:7:18,25
that's the stuff that's what the books


159
0:7:18,25 --> 0:7:21,3
one point four sixty trillion dollars


160
0:7:21,3 --> 0:7:25,629
if you don't know exactly what you all
within exactly what you alone


161
0:7:25,629 --> 0:7:29,659
when you're making bets awful one point
four six trillion dollars


162
0:7:29,659 --> 0:7:34,49
if it goes a little wrong when he may
have missed your bank


163
0:7:34,49 --> 0:7:37,199
and when wells fargo goes down


164
0:7:37,199 --> 0:7:40,65
then all the banks that are connected
embedding with wells fargo


165
0:7:40,65 --> 0:7:44,32
they also go down and here's something
really scary that's not an article that


166
0:7:44,32 --> 0:7:46,83
i know from other articles that i have
it


167
0:7:46,83 --> 0:7:49,699
all the company is now due thirty day
more


168
0:7:49,699 --> 0:7:52,679
now why is that obscure fact important
here


169
0:7:52,679 --> 0:7:54,36
is short term funding


170
0:7:54,36 --> 0:7:56,389
if the banks go under


171
0:7:56,389 --> 0:8:0,229
all the company's immediately run out of
money


172
0:8:0,229 --> 0:8:3,819
he can't pay their vendors they can't
pay their employees the campaign


173
0:8:3,819 --> 0:8:4,599
anything


174
0:8:4,599 --> 0:8:8,29
'cause there's no one to lend them the
thirty day money


175
0:8:8,29 --> 0:8:9,769
loops


176
0:8:9,769 --> 0:8:14,769
these guys are going to drag the entire
global economy down with them


177
0:8:14,769 --> 0:8:17,669
i haven't even gotten to the worst part


178
0:8:17,669 --> 0:8:20,169
now wells fargo


179
0:8:20,169 --> 0:8:21,789
actually does


180
0:8:21,789 --> 0:8:22,939
twice as much


181
0:8:22,939 --> 0:8:24,489
derivatives trades


182
0:8:24,489 --> 0:8:25,879
as it does


183
0:8:25,879 --> 0:8:28,119
variable interest entities


184
0:8:28,119 --> 0:8:32,0
it does to point the trillion dollars
it's true


185
0:8:32,0 --> 0:8:34,67
tool company


186
0:8:34,67 --> 0:8:40,23
members are will blow up the economy
last summer and two thousand


187
0:8:40,23 --> 0:8:43,69
if you think that's pat remember i told
you that wells fargo is actually the


188
0:8:43,69 --> 0:8:45,72
most conservative back


189
0:8:45,72 --> 0:8:48,44
i think this is the crap you find the
most conservative


190
0:8:48,44 --> 0:8:49,55
you're ready for


191
0:8:49,55 --> 0:8:53,55
uh... bank that is often praise j_p_
morgan my god these guys are they gotta


192
0:8:53,55 --> 0:8:57,22
figure that recently had a six billion
dollar blow up on derivative trading


193
0:8:57,22 --> 0:9:2,7
uh... endeavors and all my guide jamie
dot it once you get we had any errors at


194
0:9:2,7 --> 0:9:5,5
all by god's well that's probably the
worst of it


195
0:9:5,5 --> 0:9:6,42
you know how much


196
0:9:6,42 --> 0:9:9,82
in notional derivative trades j_p_
morgan s


197
0:9:9,82 --> 0:9:11,7
seventeen too


198
0:9:11,7 --> 0:9:15,58
trillion dollar


199
0:9:15,58 --> 0:9:20,14
five times the size of the u_s_
accounting


200
0:9:20,14 --> 0:9:23,3
now they will argue hey listen the
that's the notional value


201
0:9:23,3 --> 0:9:27,62
that doesn't mean that the whole set me
to truly in dollars and is at risk


202
0:9:27,62 --> 0:9:30,64
you know we've got that someone said we
got that some of the other side you


203
0:9:30,64 --> 0:9:32,49
can't lose them all


204
0:9:32,49 --> 0:9:35,32
so not the entire seventy trillion is at
risk


205
0:9:35,32 --> 0:9:37,17
always a percentage of it


206
0:9:37,17 --> 0:9:38,57
all that so comforting


207
0:9:38,57 --> 0:9:43,68
scott maybe only seven trillion dollars
that risk what difference does it mate


208
0:9:43,68 --> 0:9:47,61
well i tell you what's the excellent
side of the u_s_ economy


209
0:9:47,61 --> 0:9:50,41
any little error


210
0:9:50,41 --> 0:9:51,839
constand


211
0:9:51,839 --> 0:9:57,279
doesn't billions of dollars perhaps a
hundred billion dollars pick them up and


212
0:9:57,279 --> 0:10:3,98
it's like anna something transaction i
don't know talks anyway o as there is no


213
0:10:3,98 --> 0:10:6,83
hard evidence that is our verbal


214
0:10:6,83 --> 0:10:7,959
anybody who


215
0:10:7,959 --> 0:10:12,47
the reads this and that authors of the
article came the same conclusion


216
0:10:12,47 --> 0:10:14,279
we are no world over


217
0:10:14,279 --> 0:10:17,0
we're not big spread didn't think


218
0:10:17,0 --> 0:10:22,16
these guys are still completely are
really out of control


219
0:10:22,16 --> 0:10:25,92
an explosion uh... that is centered
around the banks


220
0:10:25,92 --> 0:10:28,8
is inevitable


221
0:10:28,8 --> 0:10:32,4
i mean the idea that we can fix this in
time is a joke nobody's even trying to


222
0:10:32,4 --> 0:10:33,78
fix it


223
0:10:33,78 --> 0:10:37,769
so will they make a mistake one of these
guys at one of these banks


224
0:10:37,769 --> 0:10:39,27
that then leads to


225
0:10:39,27 --> 0:10:42,2
uh... at cascading


226
0:10:42,2 --> 0:10:44,7
series of paris


227
0:10:44,7 --> 0:10:46,83
and that's that can't be paid


228
0:10:46,83 --> 0:10:48,34
absolute


229
0:10:48,34 --> 0:10:50,2
write it down in stone


230
0:10:50,2 --> 0:10:52,14
these banks are going to


231
0:10:52,14 --> 0:10:53,24
collapse


232
0:10:53,24 --> 0:10:55,66
they're gonna collapse the u_s_ economy
with it


233
0:10:55,66 --> 0:10:58,92
and almost the entire world accompli


234
0:10:58,92 --> 0:12:58,92
probably at the end of last for about
