SHANE SMITH: This is a logging
camp run by North Koreans out


3
0:0:6,47 --> 0:0:8,14
in the middle of Siberia.


4
0:0:8,14 --> 0:0:10,36
SIMON OSTROVSKY: They bring
North Koreans in.


5
0:0:10,36 --> 0:0:12,79
Most of the workers are over
40, so they all have


6
0:0:12,79 --> 0:0:13,98
families back home.


7
0:0:13,98 --> 0:0:16,75
So they know that if they try to
run away, then their family


8
0:0:16,75 --> 0:0:18,23
back home gets in trouble.

0:0:18,23 --> 0:0:20,0
Are we going to get assassinated
for going to talk


10
0:0:20,0 --> 0:0:21,49
to the North Koreans?


11
0:0:21,49 --> 0:0:22,69
SIMON OSTROVSKY:
Quite possibly.

SHANE SMITH: Should
we get arrested?


15
0:0:30,45 --> 0:0:31,7
SIMON OSTROVSKY: Yes.
