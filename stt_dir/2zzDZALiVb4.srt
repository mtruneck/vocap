into the theater side of

the presentation.

0:8:58,17 --> 0:9:0,7
HUTCH: How can we make
this better, yeah.


211
0:9:0,7 --> 0:9:2,18
And I've always worked with
music that I loved and that I


212
0:9:2,18 --> 0:9:3,26
could be passionate about.


213
0:9:3,26 --> 0:9:5,28
It really keeps coming
back to that.

I would take a punch for.

lived that--

HUTCH: I love the music.


219
0:9:15,3 --> 0:9:17,3
I love what happens when
the audience and


220
0:9:17,3 --> 0:9:18,38
the band gets together.


221
0:9:18,38 --> 0:9:20,12
That's addiction.

right now, people.

We've seen the noble element

eagle of rock and roll.


237
0:9:47,96 --> 0:9:49,86
