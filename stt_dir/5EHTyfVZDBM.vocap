###0 
###12 EDDY MORETTI: Look at that.
###14 Jesus!
###15 
###18 Another oil refinery.
###20 
###24 I wonder how far we could get before they send the little
###27 surveillance vehicle to see what the fuck we're doing.
###31 Do you mind?
###31 Do we care?
###33 
###35 SIMON DYER: How we our energy and how we do and how we
###39 impact the environment in getting that energy I think is
###42 the issue of our times.
###44 And the Alberta oil sands represent the very worst in
###48 terms of our desire to extract oil.
###50 You know basically go to any length with it.
###52 EDDY MORETTI: My heiny is freezing.
###54 
###62 When people think of oil they think of the Middle East but
###65 actually Canada has one of the largest petroleum
###68 deposits in the world.
###68 It's just that it's stuck in sand.
###71 The oil sands is an area the size of Florida and it holds
###75 an estimated 1.7 to 2.5 trillion barrels of oil.
###79 However, until recently, it's been way too expensive to
###82 extract from the sand.
###84 LINDSAY TELFER: It's the most difficult to access oil in the
###87 world and that's why it's never been seen as a viable
###91 option in the global oil economy.
###93 But because the oil prices have gone up so much, likely
###97 because we've hit peak oil, all of a sudden the most
###100 difficult to access oil in the world has now become
###103 accessible.
###104 So peak oil is--
###105 in it's very simple terms, it's exactly what it says.
###109 You hit a peak of production of available oil reserves and
###115 once you've hit that peak you start going down.
###117 So it's the reserves in the world are declining.
###121 SIMON DYER: Companies and countries are realizing
###123 strategically they're trying to figure out where this oil
###126 is going to come from as sources elsewhere in
###128 the world dry up.
###129 So Canada is considered a safe, secure source of oil.
###134 And all the major oil companies--
###136 all the multinationals in the world have
###138 operations in the oil sand.
###139 And you're seeing that stampede to try and ensure
###142 that they get a piece of the pie.
###145 EDDY MORETTI: We made our way for Fort McMurray, a small
###148 town in the middle of Canada's tundra that is the epicenter
###151 of the oil sands operation.
###154 When we were there we realized that this little town has
###158 global consequences.
###160 Fort McMurray is responsible for two-thirds of Canada's
###164 contribution to global greenhouse gas emissions which
###168 is kind of amazing when you think that it's a town of
###170 70,000 people.
###174 The problem's so big, it's so massive, affects so many
###177 different people environmentally and socially.
###180 We basically tried to cover the story from as many angles
###183 as we could and we realized that it was inexhaustible.
###187 We met the chief of the Athabaskan
###189 Region First Nation.
###191 We met the Premier of Alberta, which is like the governor.
###194 We also visited the work camps, saw the pipeline that's
###197 being built all the way to Chicago.
###199 We saw how they rip up the forest in order to discover
###202 and explore for this oil.
###204 
###207 We also snuck onto some of these sites.
###210 And the snow is really fucking deep here.
###213 Be careful.
###214 OK.
###215 Here we go.
###216 This is it.
###219 Welcome to Alberta.
###220 Welcome to the future of oil.
###224 It sucks.
###226 
###233 It really fucking sucks.
###235 And it wreaks.
###236 It smells.
###238 
###240 So we came all the way from New York because we heard
###243 there's a lot of oil here.
###245 LINDSAY TELFER: I guess the other angle is scraping at the
###246 bottom of the barrel.
###247 It is the dirtiest to produce oil in the world.
###250 The oil sands industry in Canada make up the single
###253 largest contributor to our growing greenhouse gas
###256 emissions in Canada.
###258 EDDY MORETTI: The first thing you need to understand is how
###259 they extract the oil from the sand.
###262 First they clear out the trees and mine the sand that's close
###265 to the surface.
###267 But some of the sand is deeper and to get to that they've
###271 invented a new system.
###272 It's called SAGD, or steam assisted gravity drainage.
###277 Basically they heat the soil and suck out the sand.
###281 SIMON DYER: The use of water for in situ operations is a
###284 real concern.
###285 Companies use about a fifth of a barrel of water for every
###288 barrel of oil produced in situ operations.
###292 Oil sands companies--
###293 oil sands mines basically extract water directly from
###297 the Athabasca River.
###298 Because the process, of course, pollutes that water so
###300 much, it's largely not actually returned to the
###303 Athabasca River.
###304 The vast majority of it gets dumped into
###306 these tailings ponds.
###307 So these are basically oily lagoons full of waste water
###312 and suspended hydrocarbons.
###314 If you ever get a chance to tour an oil sands mine these
###318 landscapes are quite surreal.
###319 EDDY MORETTI: Once they've dug up all the oil sand, they
###321 stick it in these huge cokers, which are like large furnaces
###325 and boil it, and steam inject it.
###328 That's how they get the oil out of the sand.
###330 And this is the process where all the greenhouse gas
###333 emissions come from.
###335 LINDSAY TELFER: Really, the only real way to get the oil
###339 sands to eliminate their carbon dioxide emissions is to
###341 stop producing the oil from the oil sands.
###344 EDDY MORETTI: And is that your position?
###347 LINDSAY TELFER: We need to slow down.
###349 But I also recognize that it's not going to stop tomorrow.
###353 Our communities can't keep pace.
###354 Our environment can't keep pace.
###356 We know we need to slow down.
###357 I think that that in itself is very clear.
###360 EDDY MORETTI: And who's pressuring us to ramp up?
###363 LINDSAY TELFER: Industry.
###364 Government.
###365 I mean the Alberta government makes a lot of money on the
###368 oil sands so until there is a viable alternative for them to
###371 shift our economy I think that they're going to continue to
###376 create the climate that's going to attract this kind of
###381 business to the province.
###382 
###387 EDDY MORETTI: We went to go ask for permission but there
###389 was no one in the office.
###391 And there are a couple of trees here.
###396 A couple of rows of a couple of trees.
###399 One, two, three, four, seven, nine, ten, a million.
###407 Logs, logs, log, log, log, log, logs.
###412 It's dangerous being a logger.
###414 But we don't know how they cut them.
###417 If they're chainsaws or if they're those tree snipper
###419 things where they just snip it.
###423 Then again, what do I know?
###424 
###427 LINDSAY TELFER: Boreal forests are the lungs of Canada.
###429 It's what cleans our air.
###431 It's what gives us the air that we can breathe.
###435 If you compare it to the Amazon forest which is often
###438 called the lungs of the earth, the Boreal forest is largely
###442 the lungs of North America
###444 EDDY MORETTI: So we kind of need it?
###444 LINDSAY TELFER: And it's the largest intact
###445 forest left in the world.
###446 
###454 EDDY MORETTI: Holy shit!
###454 Look at that thing!
###458 What are the odds of there being oil here?
###460 MALE SPEAKER: Very good.
###461 EDDY MORETTI: Yeah?
###461 MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.
###461 That's why we're doing it.
###463 
###468 EDDY MORETTI: So they just cut, cut,
###469 cut, cut their grids?
###471 MALE SPEAKER: That's right.
###471 EDDY MORETTI: And then another crew comes in.
###474 Do you consider yourself an environmentalist of sorts?
###477 MALE SPEAKER: Definitely.
###478 EDDY MORETTI: Yeah.
###478 MALE SPEAKER: Oh yeah, you betcha.
###480 EDDY MORETTI: So you have no major concerns with the way
###484 this business is operating?
###486 MALE SPEAKER: Well before we can even cut down a tree, we
###489 have to get government approval.
###491 One of the major focuses in this industry is on the
###494 environment because that's a key asset to
###497 what we do out here.
###499 EDDY MORETTI: Do you think then these lines that have
###501 been mulched will get replanted or what will happen?
###504 MALE SPEAKER: Someday, I'm sure.
###505 There's always tree planting that's going on
###509 throughout the province.
###511 EDDY MORETTI: They just have to catch up to the other guys.
###514 
###519 FRANK ROUTHIER:
###522 EDDY MORETTI: What happens when there's no more oil?
###523 FRANK ROUTHIER:
###529 EDDY MORETTI: Are you going to work in this business until
###530 you retire?
###532 FRANK ROUTHIER: And at my age, my age--
###542 I'm not that old, guys!
###543 
###566 EDDY MORETTI: Can you tell us how much you make?
###568 FRANK ROUTHIER: How much I make?
###570 
###572 This thing is oil.
###573 
###577 Then the oil is these things are oil.
###581 Everything's got oil.
###582 Even your camera inside got oil.
###584 EDDY MORETTI: It's like the economic engine of
###586 Canada, this town.
###587 FRANK ROUTHIER:
###602 EDDY MORETTI: We're going to leave the truck there.
###603 OK.
###603 We're going to go straight.
###604 FRANK ROUTHIER: Yeah.
###604 EDDY MORETTI: OK.
###606 FRANK ROUTHIER: But I give you a clipboard so you can write
###607 your comments and stuff.
###608 EDDY MORETTI: Good, good.
###609 
###613 Great.
###616 We're going there.
###618 [INAUDIBLE] men working here on the pipeline down there but
###620 [INAUDIBLE] sector 32.
###621 We want to go down to sector G9.
###624 
###636 MALE SPEAKER: So I'm sorry I forgot your first name.
###636 EDDY MORETTI: Eddie.
###636 MALE SPEAKER: Eddie, this is Jason.
###638 EDDY MORETTI: Hey.
###638 JASON: How's it going?
###638 EDDY MORETTI: Hey.
###638 How's it going buddy?
###639 JASON: Not bad.
###640 Not bad.
###641 JC: JC.
###641 They call me JC up around here.
###645 I don't like being called after a toilet because it's
###647 what they call a toilet, a john.
###649 Right?
###650 JC.
###652 EDDY MORETTI: Oh wow.
###653 JC: I had a chainsaw kickback and kind of buggered me up a
###657 little bit back a few years ago.
###659 EDDY MORETTI: Yeah, well you're lucky it didn't do
###661 anything worse.
###662 JC: I keep the sunglasses down now.
###664 I hide that stuff because the ladies don't
###666 like to see that stuff.
###667 EDDY MORETTI: So you like your job?
###669 JC: Oh I love it.
###670 EDDY MORETTI: You like trees?
###671 JC: I'm over here in fresh air, nice blue skies.
###676 Life's great.
###677 Lots of wildlife.
###677 Well, I hadn't seen anything yet but--
###679 MALE SPEAKER: You don't have to touch anything.
###683 EDDY MORETTI: They're nice trees.
###684 JC: Yeah exactly.
###686 I hate to cut them down if they don't have to go.
###690 That's our oxygen, man.
###692 You know?
###693 
###699 I hate to cut them out because it's not that I'm a tree
###702 hugger but I'm not a tree killer either.
###705 
###710 EDDY MORETTI: Wow.
###710 He's really good.
###713 Oh shit!
###716 You did a good job buddy.
###718 You were really delicate with that thing.
###720 You slowly steered it into a direction.
###724 JC: Oh yeah.
###725 Yeah it's great fun.
###726 EDDY MORETTI: You like Fort McMurray?
###728 JC: No.
###728 EDDY MORETTI: Why?
###729 JC: There's too many people in too big of a rush up here.
###733 EDDY MORETTI: Yeah.
###734 JC: Too many I don't know.
###735 Like this highway, they call it death highway.
###737 It's scares you to drive on it.
###740 You don't know if somebody's going to clean you or wipe you
###742 out or what so you keep close to the ditch, right?
###747 EDDY MORETTI: What happens to people?
###748 They just like, do they work too hard and then party too
###750 hard and then the combination gets them
###752 into trouble or what?
###754 JC: Oh, could be.
###754 It could be.
###755 There's a lot of people that do long shifts.
###758 Us, we usually take our days off after 21 or less.
###762 EDDY MORETTI: You work 21 days straight?
###764 JC: 21 days straight, yep.
###766 Then take five, six days off to enjoy life a little bit.
###770 Some of these other guys, well they get going 30, 40, 50 days
###774 straight and then--
###775 EDDY MORETTI: That's got to be-- that's just not
###777 JC: Yeah, they get--
###777 EDDY MORETTI: Healthy.
###777 JC: No.
###778 They get burned out and they get tired.
###781 It 's a way of life but it's interesting at times.
###786 Wouldn't do anything else otherwise, if I had a choice.
###789 Right?
###790 EDDY MORETTI: What's your plan then, stay here for another
###792 couple years?
###795 JC: Yeah.
###795 I float the oil patch through anyway.
###797 EDDY MORETTI: What does that mean, float
###798 the oil patch through?
###799 JC: Well, as long as there's money here, a man will be here
###802 working if he can fill his bank account up, and put the
###805 bread and butter on the table and this is where he'll be.
###808 If it ain't here, if it's in BC or if it's in Sweden, if
###813 that's where the money is, that's where we'll
###815 all have to go, right?
###817 EDDY MORETTI: Right.
###817 You have a family?
###819 JC: Yeah.
###819 I got a son.
###821 EDDY MORETTI: Here in Alberta?
###823 JC: In the Maritimes.
###824 EDDY MORETTI: In the Maritimes.
###824 JC: Yeah.
###826 EDDY MORETTI: So you're not going back home.
###828 You're here for good.
###829 JC: If I'm here, I'm here for the-- as long
###831 as the money's here.
###831 EDDY MORETTI: As long as the oil's flowing you're--
###833 JC: Yeah.
###834 Exactly.
###835 The welfare line's not for me.
###837 EDDY MORETTI: Right on.
###840 SIMON DYER: George Bush's State of the Union Address a
###842 couple of years ago--
###843 EDDY MORETTI: Last year.
###843 Right.
###845 SIMON DYER: Pretty bluntly said we're addicted to foreign
###848 oil and we need to get off foreign oil.
###849 And he didn't consider--
###850 I don't think he considers Canada foreign in that
###852 respective.
###855 MALE SPEAKER: Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for
###856 coming this afternoon.
###858 And first and foremost, I want to welcome back to Fort
###862 McMurray our premier Ed Stelmach.
###864 Premier, welcome back to Fort McMurray.
###868 ED STELMACH: Over the past year, I've spoken to a lot of
###871 ordinary Albertans.
###873 They are proud of Alberta's position in Canada as an
###876 economic powerhouse.
###878 However, there is always a word of caution and that is
###881 Ed, don't blow it.
###884 EDDY MORETTI: This is the new premier, Ed Stelmach.
###886 He took over from this guy, Ralph Klein.
###889 And he's the guy responsible for kick-starting the oil
###892 sands in the '90s.
###894 While you were premier, were you pressured by
###898 multinationals
###898 RALPH KLEIN: No.
###899 EDDY MORETTI: To increase production?
###900 RALPH KLEIN: No.
###900 Never.
###902 10 years ago, I took a delegation down to Houston and
###907 I can recall holding a symposium to talk about the
###912 oil sands, and how Canada can meet the reliable and secure
###920 supply that the
###922 EDDY MORETTI: Stable.
###922 RALPH KLEIN: US is looking for.
###923 The stable supply.
###924 First of all, we stationed a person in Washington, DC to
###929 focus really on the American legislators, those in Congress
###934 and in Senate--
###936 EDDY MORETTI: And is working, his work is having results?
###939 RALPH KLEIN: His work is--
###940 well, his work has been highly successful.
###942 
###945 LINDSAY TELFER: We've created the most accessible investment
###949 climate for oil companies.
###950 EDDY MORETTI: Why?
###951 LINDSAY TELFER: Heck, because we wanted the investment.
###954 We wanted people to come in.
###955 So in the '90s we set up a royalty regime that allowed
###958 them to virtually not pay royalties.
###960 A majority of the oil sands, once it's upgraded and refined
###964 and often before it's upgraded and refined, is
###966 shipped to the States.
###968 The Chicago area is one of the sent hubs
###973 for the bitumen upgrading.
###977 EDDY MORETTI: This pipe goes all the way to
###982 Chicago, which is far.
###987 We're good for 50 years, America, and
###989 after that you're fucked.
###991 You're on your own.
###993 SIMON DYER: The tar sands is producing about a million
###995 barrels of oil a day.
###997 And there are discussions to increase that to 5 million
###1000 barrels a day.
###1002 America, of course, uses more than 20 million
###1004 barrels of oil a day.
###1005 So I mean the tar sands can plug that gap for only a very
###1009 short period and it's never going to be able to meet
###1011 Americans' needs so we need to look at other solutions.
###1014 LINDSAY TELFER: When you're in government, there's a lot of
###1016 pressure to be open and friendly to industrial
###1020 development and Klein was the best of the best of them.
###1025 And what we're seeing now is some of those leaders going
###1027 whoa, maybe we did this a little bit too fast.
###1029 OK.
###1030 Well obviously there's been no plan.
###1031 That's why it spiraled out of control.
###1033 Our communities have spiraled out of control.
###1035 Development has spiraled out of control.
###1037 Klein came out after he left office saying, no, we didn't
###1040 have a plan.
###1040 We just said come on in.
###1043 EDDY MORETTI: People have said that you have said that you
###1045 didn't have a plan for the development of the oil sands.
###1048 RALPH KLEIN: No.
###1049 EDDY MORETTI: Is that true?
###1049 Or is that misquoting you?
###1050 RALPH KLEIN: No.
###1051 We had a plan for sustainable growth.
###1055 We had a plan for $50 a barrel oil and gas at $6.50 a
###1063 gigajoule, but we didn't have a plan for
###1066 unprecedented growth.
###1068 No one has a plan.
###1069 Not even the current premier or the current cabinet has a
###1072 plan for unprecedented growth, nor does Al Gore have a plan,
###1077 by the way.
###1077 EDDY MORETTI: Right.
###1078 RALPH KLEIN: And you're asking for a personal opinion--
###1080 EDDY MORETTI: Yeah.
###1080 RALPH KLEIN: And I can offer a personal opinion, and I say
###1083 let the markets prevail.
###1084
