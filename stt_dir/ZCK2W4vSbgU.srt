0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:2,73



2
0:0:2,73 --> 0:0:3,23
BETH HOYT: Hi, guys.


3
0:0:3,23 --> 0:0:4,63
I'm here at the YouTube
space in the


4
0:0:4,63 --> 0:0:6,12
beautiful Playa del Rey.


5
0:0:6,12 --> 0:0:9,12
And you all know the old adage,
"Everybody Loves Playa


6
0:0:9,12 --> 0:0:10,54
del Raymond." Right?


7
0:0:10,54 --> 0:0:11,61
TIMOTHY DELAGHETTO: [LAUGHS]


8
0:0:11,61 --> 0:0:12,17
BETH HOYT: Thank you.


9
0:0:12,17 --> 0:0:12,66
Thank you.


10
0:0:12,66 --> 0:0:12,93
Thank you very much.


11
0:0:12,93 --> 0:0:13,96
TIMOTHY DELAGHETTO: As you
could see, all tonight is


12
0:0:13,96 --> 0:0:16,23
Stand-Up Night featuring the
best of up-and-coming


13
0:0:16,23 --> 0:0:17,75
stand-ups you've never seen.


14
0:0:17,75 --> 0:0:18,27
BETH HOYT: Oh, my god.


15
0:0:18,27 --> 0:0:19,22
Holy crap!


16
0:0:19,22 --> 0:0:20,2
A dead body.


17
0:0:20,2 --> 0:0:22,24
TIMOTHY DELAGHETTO: Oh, my
gosh, it's Bart from


18
0:0:22,24 --> 0:0:22,79
JustKiddingFilms.


19
0:0:22,79 --> 0:0:24,22
And he's dead!


20
0:0:24,22 --> 0:0:24,64
BETH HOYT: Oh, my god.


21
0:0:24,64 --> 0:0:25,98
He's been murdered.


22
0:0:25,98 --> 0:0:27,429
But who did it?


23
0:0:27,429 --> 0:0:28,878
[DRUM ROLL]


24
0:0:28,878 --> 0:0:32,259



25
0:0:32,259 --> 0:0:34,445
BETH HOYT: Anyway, let's solve
the mystery of what's been


26
0:0:34,445 --> 0:0:36,13
going on with "YouTube
Comedy Week"?


27
0:0:36,13 --> 0:0:37,38
TIMOTHY DELAGHETTO: Sounds
good to me, Beth.


28
0:0:37,38 --> 0:0:40,959



29
0:0:40,959 --> 0:0:42,51
MARK DOUGLAS: Welcome
to Day 3 of the


30
0:0:42,51 --> 0:0:44,24
Comedy Week Daily Rundown.


31
0:0:44,24 --> 0:0:44,72
TODD WOMACK: I'm Todd.


32
0:0:44,72 --> 0:0:45,49
He's Mark.


33
0:0:45,49 --> 0:0:47,97
We've got the inside track on
some big Comedy Week events


34
0:0:47,97 --> 0:0:48,89
and debut videos.


35
0:0:48,89 --> 0:0:51,14
And we've got some great special
guests joining us in


36
0:0:51,14 --> 0:0:51,62
the studio.


37
0:0:51,62 --> 0:0:55,915
But without further ado, let's
hear our Comedy Week Specials.


38
0:0:55,915 --> 0:0:56,218
MARK DOUGLAS: [ITALIAN ACCENT]


39
0:0:56,218 --> 0:0:57,59
OK, you like to hear
the specials?


40
0:0:57,59 --> 0:1:0,15
We got a nice little video
from Official Comedy.


41
0:1:0,15 --> 0:1:3,37
It's called "Art of the Cold
Call" with David Koechner.


42
0:1:3,37 --> 0:1:5,22
He from "Anchorman,"
you know, wear the


43
0:1:5,22 --> 0:1:7,3
cowboy hat, very funny.


44
0:1:7,3 --> 0:1:10,41
That comes with a side salad
and yucca fries.


45
0:1:10,41 --> 0:1:12,635
It's a little different,
a little bitter.


46
0:1:12,635 --> 0:1:14,36
You want a little taste?


47
0:1:14,36 --> 0:1:16,8
Vinnie, give them a taste
of [INAUDIBLE]


48
0:1:16,8 --> 0:1:18,17
kitchen!


49
0:1:18,17 --> 0:1:19,29
This will be nice.


50
0:1:19,29 --> 0:1:19,44
Faster.


51
0:1:19,44 --> 0:1:22,35
DAVID KOECHNER: Number
1, get them to yes.


52
0:1:22,35 --> 0:1:25,15
Number 2, the take-away.


53
0:1:25,15 --> 0:1:26,21
Agreement.


54
0:1:26,21 --> 0:1:27,26
Yes.


55
0:1:27,26 --> 0:1:28,44
Nice day.


56
0:1:28,44 --> 0:1:30,16
Yes.


57
0:1:30,16 --> 0:1:31,88
Do you believe in education?


58
0:1:31,88 --> 0:1:33,62
Yes.


59
0:1:33,62 --> 0:1:33,86
MARK DOUGLAS: [ITALIAN ACCENT]


60
0:1:33,86 --> 0:1:36,58
Also, chef asked me to tell
you that we're all out of


61
0:1:36,58 --> 0:1:39,11
astronaut singing in the
space with David Bowie.


62
0:1:39,11 --> 0:1:41,15
We had a party of 2 million
coming last night.


63
0:1:41,15 --> 0:1:42,1
They clean us out.


64
0:1:42,1 --> 0:1:44,21
For something a little different
for the kids, we


65
0:1:44,21 --> 0:1:48,62
have WWE FanNation with the
"what?" of a personality.


66
0:1:48,62 --> 0:1:49,65
Spoiler alert!


67
0:1:49,65 --> 0:1:51,94
This video contains
a screaming goat.


68
0:1:51,94 --> 0:1:53,59
So if you're allergic to
screaming goat, you might not


69
0:1:53,59 --> 0:1:54,99
want to watch.


70
0:1:54,99 --> 0:1:56,0
But I think he's like.


71
0:1:56,0 --> 0:1:57,24
OK, my name Vittorio.


72
0:1:57,24 --> 0:1:58,465
I'll be around the back
and give you minute


73
0:1:58,465 --> 0:1:59,5
to think about it.


74
0:1:59,5 --> 0:2:1,11
If you want to watch anything,
you just click on


75
0:2:1,11 --> 0:2:2,19
it right over here.


76
0:2:2,19 --> 0:2:4,98
I bring you the wine list and
the bread for the table, maybe


77
0:2:4,98 --> 0:2:7,2
some crayons for the
children, OK?


78
0:2:7,2 --> 0:2:9,49
Vinnie, Italian gibberish.


79
0:2:9,49 --> 0:2:10,99
DANISNOTONFIRE: Oh, I think
we're both looking forward to


80
0:2:10,99 --> 0:2:12,88
the traditional Comedy
Week chicken.


81
0:2:12,88 --> 0:2:13,61
AMAZINGPHIL: Oh, yes.


82
0:2:13,61 --> 0:2:14,29
DANISNOTONFIRE: What
a tradition.


83
0:2:14,29 --> 0:2:15,54
But more importantly--


84
0:2:15,54 --> 0:2:17,91
AMAZINGPHIL: The best thing to
come out of England, Mr. Bean


85
0:2:17,91 --> 0:2:18,78
is coming back.


86
0:2:18,78 --> 0:2:21,19
DANISNOTONFIRE: More the Queen,
Beatles-- no, Mr. Bean.


87
0:2:21,19 --> 0:2:22,29
AMAZINGPHIL: I'm so excited.


88
0:2:22,29 --> 0:2:24,26
DANISNOTONFIRE: But don't do
this at home because you'll


89
0:2:24,26 --> 0:2:26,12
probably tell everyone
you know.


90
0:2:26,12 --> 0:2:27,21
TODD WOMACK: And we're back.


91
0:2:27,21 --> 0:2:28,97
Joining us in the studio
are YouTube


92
0:2:28,97 --> 0:2:30,42
heroes, Rhett and Link.


93
0:2:30,42 --> 0:2:31,5
RHETT: Honored to be here.


94
0:2:31,5 --> 0:2:33,13
LINK: We also heard
it was mandatory.


95
0:2:33,13 --> 0:2:34,81
MARK DOUGLAS: We'll accept
both of those answers.


96
0:2:34,81 --> 0:2:37,3
TODD WOMACK: Guys, the videos on
your channel, Rhett & Link,


97
0:2:37,3 --> 0:2:40,26
are so funny and creative and
you're such nice guys.


98
0:2:40,26 --> 0:2:42,71
But I think, what most people
out there want to know is, who


99
0:2:42,71 --> 0:2:43,97
would win in a fight
to the death?


100
0:2:43,97 --> 0:2:45,79
RHETT: Well, that's actually
already occurred.


101
0:2:45,79 --> 0:2:47,0
And I won, Link died.


102
0:2:47,0 --> 0:2:48,18
But I resuscitated him.


103
0:2:48,18 --> 0:2:49,92
LINK: And now, I'm immortal.


104
0:2:49,92 --> 0:2:52,53
MARK DOUGLAS: That's nice.


105
0:2:52,53 --> 0:2:55,23
TODD WOMACK: Now, it's time
for Interview Tube.


106
0:2:55,23 --> 0:2:57,12
Our first question,
who is who?


107
0:2:57,12 --> 0:3:0,22
And can you give us a mnemonic
device to help remember?


108
0:3:0,22 --> 0:3:1,34
RHETT: I'm Rhett.


109
0:3:1,34 --> 0:3:3,69
I am really smart.


110
0:3:3,69 --> 0:3:4,76
LINK: And I'm Link.


111
0:3:4,76 --> 0:3:6,94
I'm the one with glasses--


112
0:3:6,94 --> 0:3:8,51
"L," "glasses."


113
0:3:8,51 --> 0:3:10,7
TODD WOMACK: Easy to
remember, though.


114
0:3:10,7 --> 0:3:13,39
RHETT: We did make a video for
Comedy Week that we want to


115
0:3:13,39 --> 0:3:14,45
tell everyone to watch.


116
0:3:14,45 --> 0:3:14,96
TODD WOMACK: Bring it.


117
0:3:14,96 --> 0:3:16,43
LINK: YouTube Challenge
Challenge.


118
0:3:16,43 --> 0:3:17,9
That's what it's called.


119
0:3:17,9 --> 0:3:19,79
There's the word "challenge"
is twice in the title.


120
0:3:19,79 --> 0:3:24,73
But in the actual video, there
is even more challenges.


121
0:3:24,73 --> 0:3:25,55
TODD WOMACK: More than two?


122
0:3:25,55 --> 0:3:26,18
LINK: Yeah.


123
0:3:26,18 --> 0:3:26,96
There's lots of challenge.


124
0:3:26,96 --> 0:3:30,69
RHETT: We took all the
challenges that everyone does.


125
0:3:30,69 --> 0:3:32,98
Cinnamon Challenge and
Baby Food Challenge--


126
0:3:32,98 --> 0:3:33,975
LINK: --Tin Can Challenge.


127
0:3:33,975 --> 0:3:35,82
RHETT: All that stuff.


128
0:3:35,82 --> 0:3:37,32
First of all, we've never
done any of it.


129
0:3:37,32 --> 0:3:38,42
We don't plan on it.


130
0:3:38,42 --> 0:3:41,12
But we just talked a bunch of
YouTubers into doing all of


131
0:3:41,12 --> 0:3:42,22
them in one video.


132
0:3:42,22 --> 0:3:43,89
MARK DOUGLAS: So you, guys,
make really awesome local


133
0:3:43,89 --> 0:3:44,59
commercials.


134
0:3:44,59 --> 0:3:46,63
How did that start?


135
0:3:46,63 --> 0:3:49,15
LINK: We've always been inspired
by just really bad


136
0:3:49,15 --> 0:3:50,37
commercials--


137
0:3:50,37 --> 0:3:53,11
used car salesman, 2 o'clock
in the morning, has his own


138
0:3:53,11 --> 0:3:54,9
address, "dress up in a chicken
suit" kind of thing.


139
0:3:54,9 --> 0:3:58,61
So we decided to start emulating
those on our


140
0:3:58,61 --> 0:4:1,35
channel, but we wanted to make
sure they weren't just spoofs.


141
0:4:1,35 --> 0:4:2,95
They were real commercials.


142
0:4:2,95 --> 0:4:5,26
TODD WOMACK: If you guys
were to make a local


143
0:4:5,26 --> 0:4:5,92
commercial for YouTube.


144
0:4:5,92 --> 0:4:7,4
What do you really think
that would be?


145
0:4:7,4 --> 0:4:12,78
LINK: I'd put a llama and a
YouTube logo and have it talk


146
0:4:12,78 --> 0:4:13,68
or something.


147
0:4:13,68 --> 0:4:15,43
MARK DOUGLAS: Because you could
fit the YouTube logo


148
0:4:15,43 --> 0:4:16,45
right on the side of--


149
0:4:16,45 --> 0:4:17,3
LINK: --of a llama.


150
0:4:17,3 --> 0:4:18,79
TODD WOMACK: You, guys, spent
that much time thinking about


151
0:4:18,79 --> 0:4:19,67
your other ones?


152
0:4:19,67 --> 0:4:20,36
RHETT: No.


153
0:4:20,36 --> 0:4:21,779
MARK DOUGLAS: Have
you ever saved a


154
0:4:21,779 --> 0:4:23,78
business from collapse?


155
0:4:23,78 --> 0:4:24,6
LINK: Every single one.


156
0:4:24,6 --> 0:4:25,11
RHETT: I'd like to think so.


157
0:4:25,11 --> 0:4:26,838
[LAUGHTER]


158
0:4:26,838 --> 0:4:29,0
MARK DOUGLAS: So you, guys,
are sort of jacks of all


159
0:4:29,0 --> 0:4:30,13
trades on YouTube.


160
0:4:30,13 --> 0:4:33,88
You do music, advertising,
editing, directing, acting.


161
0:4:33,88 --> 0:4:36,62
How about teaching the viewers
a little bit about green


162
0:4:36,62 --> 0:4:40,5
screen in a segment we like to
call "Green Screen Basics With


163
0:4:40,5 --> 0:4:42,61
Rhett & Link"?


164
0:4:42,61 --> 0:4:44,13
LINK: I mean, we have somewhere
we got to be.


165
0:4:44,13 --> 0:4:44,525
RHETT: We got to get going.


166
0:4:44,525 --> 0:4:44,92
TODD WOMACK: Great.


167
0:4:44,92 --> 0:4:46,4
Let's get started.


168
0:4:46,4 --> 0:4:47,29
LINK: They didn't notice us.


169
0:4:47,29 --> 0:4:50,12



170
0:4:50,12 --> 0:4:52,96
Well, first of all, you've got
to have a green screen.


171
0:4:52,96 --> 0:4:55,98
RHETT: And that's
what that is.


172
0:4:55,98 --> 0:5:0,8
And then you want to think about
any environment at all


173
0:5:0,8 --> 0:5:4,11
that you want to put yourself
in, like a space ship or a


174
0:5:4,11 --> 0:5:6,49
classroom or a space ship.


175
0:5:6,49 --> 0:5:8,76
LINK: And then you close your
eyes and you click your heels


176
0:5:8,76 --> 0:5:11,4
three times.


177
0:5:11,4 --> 0:5:12,58
RHETT: But you don't want to
click the fourth time because


178
0:5:12,58 --> 0:5:14,47
at that point, you will open
up a hole in the space-time


179
0:5:14,47 --> 0:5:16,68
continuum leading to
a evil universe.


180
0:5:16,68 --> 0:5:18,94
LINK: Oop, that's four.


181
0:5:18,94 --> 0:5:20,8
RHETT: Like this.


182
0:5:20,8 --> 0:5:22,75
And then, of course, remember
don't wear green.


183
0:5:22,75 --> 0:5:23,97
That's very important to note.


184
0:5:23,97 --> 0:5:25,94
LINK: And then you strike
a pose in order


185
0:5:25,94 --> 0:5:28,564
to make a fast exit.


186
0:5:28,564 --> 0:5:31,7
RHETT: Do something else
with your body.


187
0:5:31,7 --> 0:5:32,54
TODD WOMACK: Hey,
what did you do?


188
0:5:32,54 --> 0:5:32,87
What did you do to our--


189
0:5:32,87 --> 0:5:35,29
MARK DOUGLAS: Hey, Rhett, Link,
can you get us out of


190
0:5:35,29 --> 0:5:37,66
here, maybe, is there
like an Apple Z?


191
0:5:37,66 --> 0:5:40,72
TODD WOMACK: --like an ancient
incantation or something to


192
0:5:40,72 --> 0:5:42,8
get out of here?


193
0:5:42,8 --> 0:5:45,5
I know it's not a full
moon, but nice guys.


194
0:5:45,5 --> 0:5:46,83
MARK DOUGLAS: Very nice,
other than this.


195
0:5:46,83 --> 0:5:47,47
TODD WOMACK: Funny,
funny guys.


196
0:5:47,47 --> 0:5:48,33
MARK DOUGLAS: They
know their stuff.


197
0:5:48,33 --> 0:5:48,94
I really like those guys.


198
0:5:48,94 --> 0:5:49,995
TODD WOMACK: Thank you,
guys, for watching.


199
0:5:49,995 --> 0:5:51,5
We'll be back tomorrow.


200
0:5:51,5 --> 0:5:55,13
But come back to this channel
at 9:00 PM Eastern, 6:00


201
0:5:55,13 --> 0:5:57,6
Pacific for the stand-up
night.


202
0:5:57,6 --> 0:6:0,39
There'll be all sorts of great
comedians, even myself.


203
0:6:0,39 --> 0:6:2,82
And we'll catch up with you
tomorrow on this show.


204
0:6:2,82 --> 0:6:3,55
MARK DOUGLAS: We'll
see you tomorrow.


205
0:6:3,55 --> 0:6:6,4
And if we can get out of here.


206
0:6:6,4 --> 0:6:7,52
Maybe go over that
way or something?


207
0:6:7,52 --> 0:6:9,61
TODD WOMACK: I like a less
deadly neighborhood.


208
0:6:9,61 --> 0:6:11,41
MARK DOUGLAS: I'm pretty sure
there's an evil worm in my ear


209
0:6:11,41 --> 0:6:13,42
right now eating my brain.


210
0:6:13,42 --> 0:6:14,56
It could just be wax.


211
0:6:14,56 --> 0:6:16,113
TODD WOMACK: Get some evil ear
medicine or something.


212
0:6:16,113 --> 0:6:18,428
I don't know.


213
0:6:18,428 --> 0:6:28,726
[MUSIC PLAYING]


214
0:6:28,726 --> 0:6:30,77
BETH HOYT: It looks like
such great stuff.


215
0:6:30,77 --> 0:6:33,79
And remember that last night's
big show is available to watch


216
0:6:33,79 --> 0:6:36,3

217
0:6:36,3 --> 0:6:37,66

221

222
0:6:43,39 --> 0:6:45,86
It premieres today from The
Lonely Island, Above


223
0:6:45,86 --> 0:6:47,58
Average, and more.


224
0:6:47,58 --> 0:6:49,95
TIMOTHY DELAGHETTO: Plus, on the
videos from Michael Cera,


225
0:6:49,95 --> 0:6:52,73
like the "Gregory Goes Boom."


226
0:6:52,73 --> 0:6:54,4
BETH HOYT: Oh, Bart
tell us that--


227
0:6:54,4 --> 0:6:54,66
oh, you know what?


228
0:6:54,66 --> 0:6:56,76
Bart, who killed you?


229
0:6:56,76 --> 0:6:59,72
BART: Timothy DeLaGhetto
did it.


230
0:6:59,72 --> 0:7:2,97
BETH HOYT: Timothy,
you killed him?


231
0:7:2,97 --> 0:7:2,524
TIMOTHY DELAGHETTO: What?


232
0:7:2,524 --> 0:7:4,65
How'd you figure that out?


233
0:7:4,65 --> 0:7:6,556
BETH HOYT: You will
never know.


234
0:7:6,556 --> 0:7:7,492
TIMOTHY DELAGHETTO: Ooh!


235
0:7:7,492 --> 0:7:9,51
I'm a kill you, too, bitch.


236
0:7:9,51 --> 0:7:11,36
BETH HOYT: I got you
on that one.


237
0:7:11,36 --> 0:7:13,75
Cool, well, great.


238
0:7:13,75 --> 0:7:15,49
You, guys, just stay
tuned for the show.


239
0:7:15,49 --> 0:7:16,58
Hope you all come
back tomorrow.


240
0:7:16,58 --> 0:7:20,556
Right now, it's Stand-Up
Night!


241
0:7:20,556 --> 0:7:27,528
[APPLAUSE]


242
0:7:27,528 --> 0:7:37,986



243
0:7:37,986 --> 0:7:39,236
SEAN O'CONNOR: Hey.


244
0:7:39,236 --> 0:7:42,966



245
0:7:42,966 --> 0:7:44,46
Hi.


246
0:7:44,46 --> 0:7:45,71
Hey.


247
0:7:45,71 --> 0:7:47,46



248
0:7:47,46 --> 0:7:49,983
Hi.


249
0:7:49,983 --> 0:7:51,233
Hey.


250
0:7:51,233 --> 0:7:53,76



251
0:7:53,76 --> 0:7:55,95
Hey.


252
0:7:55,95 --> 0:7:56,38
What's up?


253
0:7:56,38 --> 0:7:58,84
I'm Sean, nice to
meet you all.


254
0:7:58,84 --> 0:8:2,17
Let's get this energy up.


255
0:8:2,17 --> 0:8:5,6
[APPLAUSE]


256
0:8:5,6 --> 0:8:7,7
SEAN O'CONNOR: Cool.


257
0:8:7,7 --> 0:8:8,32
Cool.


258
0:8:8,32 --> 0:8:11,1



259
0:8:11,1 --> 0:8:12,13
I live in Los Angeles now.


260
0:8:12,13 --> 0:8:13,82
I used to live in Brooklyn,
New York.


261
0:8:13,82 --> 0:8:16,5
Where is Brooklyn at?


262
0:8:16,5 --> 0:8:20,12
No, it's not here.


263
0:8:20,12 --> 0:8:21,97
I had to leave Brooklyn, New
York, when I saw the worst


264
0:8:21,97 --> 0:8:23,52
thing ever in my neighborhood.


265
0:8:23,52 --> 0:8:28,34
I saw a cop with
a face tattoo.


266
0:8:28,34 --> 0:8:30,26
I'm going to repeat that one
more time because you guys are


267
0:8:30,26 --> 0:8:34,9
acting like that's normal
for wherever.


268
0:8:34,9 --> 0:8:39,98
I saw a cop, like a police
officer, with a face tattoo.


269
0:8:39,98 --> 0:8:42,909
If you see a cop with a face
tattoo, that means one thing.


270
0:8:42,909 --> 0:8:48,3
It means somewhere, there's
a dead naked cop.


271
0:8:48,3 --> 0:8:49,75
It's not supposed to happen.


272
0:8:49,75 --> 0:8:52,27



273
0:8:52,27 --> 0:8:53,43
I was just in Austin, Texas.


274
0:8:53,43 --> 0:8:56,41
I went to a restaurant
called Bikinis.


275
0:8:56,41 --> 0:8:59,176
And guys, you will never guess
the uniform there.


276
0:8:59,176 --> 0:9:2,21



277
0:9:2,21 --> 0:9:4,94
It's bikinis.


278
0:9:4,94 --> 0:9:7,78
The waitresses wear bikinis
at the restaurant.


279
0:9:7,78 --> 0:9:9,69
Bikinis.


280
0:9:9,69 --> 0:9:11,78
Me and my friend, Jared, went
there for a professional


281
0:9:11,78 --> 0:9:12,98
business dinner.


282
0:9:12,98 --> 0:9:14,23
We sat down.


283
0:9:14,23 --> 0:9:17,3



284
0:9:17,3 --> 0:9:19,92
The waitress came up to us and
she was like, what you all


285
0:9:19,92 --> 0:9:21,95
having to drink?


286
0:9:21,95 --> 0:9:24,63
And I said, a Diet Coke.


287
0:9:24,63 --> 0:9:28,62
And my friend said,
a Texas Stripper.


288
0:9:28,62 --> 0:9:32,3
It took five seconds.


289
0:9:32,3 --> 0:9:34,8
12 minutes later,
she came back.


290
0:9:34,8 --> 0:9:38,87
And she was like, hey, I'm
all out of sorts, ha-ha.


291
0:9:38,87 --> 0:9:42,57
What were you all having
to drink again?


292
0:9:42,57 --> 0:9:48,9
A Diet Coke, Texas Stripper.


293
0:9:48,9 --> 0:9:53,1
Five seconds, maybe less, she
walked away to get those


294
0:9:53,1 --> 0:9:54,92
drinks again.


295
0:9:54,92 --> 0:10:2,2
She came back 21 minutes later
and said, I screwed up.


296
0:10:2,2 --> 0:10:7,9
What where you all having
to drink again?


297
0:10:7,9 --> 0:10:10,85
At that moment, I realized had
she been wearing a shirt, she


298
0:10:10,85 --> 0:10:14,7
would have been the worst
waitress ever.


299
0:10:14,7 --> 0:10:15,71
But she wasn't, so Top 5.


300
0:10:15,71 --> 0:10:19,26
So it's pretty good.


301
0:10:19,26 --> 0:10:19,83
I love music.


302
0:10:19,83 --> 0:10:21,68
My favorite thing about music
right now is Ke$ha.


303
0:10:21,68 --> 0:10:23,26
I love Ke$ha.


304
0:10:23,26 --> 0:10:24,79
Not a lot of Ke$ha
fans out there?


305
0:10:24,79 --> 0:10:27,7
For those of you who don't know
who Ke$ha is, she's the


306
0:10:27,7 --> 0:10:28,59
new Beatles.


307
0:10:28,59 --> 0:10:31,23
And she's incredible.


308
0:10:31,23 --> 0:10:32,29
I want to see Ke$ha live.


309
0:10:32,29 --> 0:10:34,49
It was the best night
of my entire life.


310
0:10:34,49 --> 0:10:36,46
Like her audience is so diverse,
there is like me, and


311
0:10:36,46 --> 0:10:37,71
the 9,000 teenage girls.


312
0:10:37,71 --> 0:10:38,51
And like, we're all the same.


313
0:10:38,51 --> 0:10:40,79
I don't know, whatever.


314
0:10:40,79 --> 0:10:41,75
They were all the same.


315
0:10:41,75 --> 0:10:44,29
They were all 15 and trying
to be slutty, but had no


316
0:10:44,29 --> 0:10:46,41
idea how to do it.


317
0:10:46,41 --> 0:10:48,4
They're going up to guys and,
like, you could put it


318
0:10:48,4 --> 0:10:50,84
wherever you want, whatever
that means.


319
0:10:50,84 --> 0:10:53,93
It's like, you're not going
to like what that means.


320
0:10:53,93 --> 0:10:55,35
It means the butt.


321
0:10:55,35 --> 0:11:0,26
[LAUGHS]


322
0:11:0,26 --> 0:11:1,78
And then Ke$ha came out.


323
0:11:1,78 --> 0:11:4,61
And guys, it was the best
fucking concert


324
0:11:4,61 --> 0:11:6,3
I've ever been to.


325
0:11:6,3 --> 0:11:7,84
It was incredible.


326
0:11:7,84 --> 0:11:8,57
Oh, my god.


327
0:11:8,57 --> 0:11:9,56
I found out so much.


328
0:11:9,56 --> 0:11:11,69
Did you guys know she has
more than three songs?


329
0:11:11,69 --> 0:11:12,94
That's cool.


330
0:11:12,94 --> 0:11:16,74



331
0:11:16,74 --> 0:11:17,71
And then this happened.


332
0:11:17,71 --> 0:11:19,3
It's the best thing that's
ever happened


333
0:11:19,3 --> 0:11:20,73
to me at any concert.


334
0:11:20,73 --> 0:11:22,95
She was in the middle of her
seventh song, which is about


335
0:11:22,95 --> 0:11:26,34
how her vagina is
a gold TransAm.


336
0:11:26,34 --> 0:11:28,89
She's super classy.


337
0:11:28,89 --> 0:11:30,85
The chorus says, wham,
bam, thank you, man.


338
0:11:30,85 --> 0:11:32,84
You want to take a ride
in my gold TransAm.


339
0:11:32,84 --> 0:11:34,51
OK.


340
0:11:34,51 --> 0:11:35,6
She hits the chorus.


341
0:11:35,6 --> 0:11:36,8
And then this happens.


342
0:11:36,8 --> 0:11:39,49
She goes, stop!


343
0:11:39,49 --> 0:11:41,75
And all the musicians stopped.


344
0:11:41,75 --> 0:11:46,19
And me and the other teenage
girls all stopped because our


345
0:11:46,19 --> 0:11:47,44
queen was about to speak.


346
0:11:47,44 --> 0:11:49,98



347
0:11:49,98 --> 0:11:56,56
Then she said, I just
realized something.


348
0:11:56,56 --> 0:11:59,57
And I'm like, what did she just
realize in the middle of


349
0:11:59,57 --> 0:12:4,64
her song about how her pussy
is a gold Trans Am?


350
0:12:4,64 --> 0:12:7,94
She's good at multitasking.


351
0:12:7,94 --> 0:12:12,77
Then she said, I just realized
there's not enough glitter on


352
0:12:12,77 --> 0:12:14,2
these titties!


353
0:12:14,2 --> 0:12:17,69



354
0:12:17,69 --> 0:12:22,11
And then that guy with a bucket
came out and poured so


355
0:12:22,11 --> 0:12:27,474
much glitter on those titties,
he saved the concert.


356
0:12:27,474 --> 0:12:36,76
[APPLAUSE]


357
0:12:36,76 --> 0:12:38,93
SEAN O'CONNOR: So I googled it
to see if that was the one


358
0:12:38,93 --> 0:12:42,41
show where Ke$ha never
remembered to put glitties on


359
0:12:42,41 --> 0:12:44,87
those titties.


360
0:12:44,87 --> 0:12:47,83
No, it happened at
all 83 shows.


361
0:12:47,83 --> 0:12:50,26
That was the guy's job.


362
0:12:50,26 --> 0:12:53,42
That's simply a job you
get on Craigslist.


363
0:12:53,42 --> 0:12:54,94
Words like, "must have
own bucket." He's,


364
0:12:54,94 --> 0:12:56,742
like, I got a bucket.


365
0:12:56,742 --> 0:12:58,63
Let's do it.


366
0:12:58,63 --> 0:12:59,13
All right, guys.


367
0:12:59,13 --> 0:12:59,99
That's been my time.


368
0:12:59,99 --> 0:13:0,39
Thank you.


369
0:13:0,39 --> 0:13:3,54
I'm Sean O' Connor.


370
0:13:3,54 --> 0:13:6,325
Are you, guys, ready to
keep this show moving?


371
0:13:6,325 --> 0:13:9,442



372
0:13:9,442 --> 0:13:14,27
Your next comic is the only
female winner on "Last Comic


373
0:13:14,27 --> 0:13:15,11
Standing's" history.


374
0:13:15,11 --> 0:13:17,78
She's the host of the dating
show, "Excused." Please put


375
0:13:17,78 --> 0:13:20,166
your hands together for
Iliza Schlesinger.


376
0:13:20,166 --> 0:13:23,652
[APPLAUSE]


377
0:13:23,652 --> 0:13:24,15
ILIZA SHLESINGER: What's up?


378
0:13:24,15 --> 0:13:25,146
This is fantastic.


379
0:13:25,146 --> 0:13:26,64
How are you, guys, doing?


380
0:13:26,64 --> 0:13:30,126



381
0:13:30,126 --> 0:13:32,59
Everybody here is so attractive,
is this is like a


382
0:13:32,59 --> 0:13:33,92
CW casting call?


383
0:13:33,92 --> 0:13:35,313
And it' just like we
didn't get it.


384
0:13:35,313 --> 0:13:35,5
We're here.


385
0:13:35,5 --> 0:13:35,67
That's fine.


386
0:13:35,67 --> 0:13:36,63
My hair's super long.


387
0:13:36,63 --> 0:13:37,9
That's fun.


388
0:13:37,9 --> 0:13:38,66
Because when you have long hair,
no one expects you to


389
0:13:38,66 --> 0:13:40,59
say anything, ever.


390
0:13:40,59 --> 0:13:41,86
I won't even be smart.


391
0:13:41,86 --> 0:13:43,53
I'm pretty sure, like, all of
Hugh Hefner's girlfriends were


392
0:13:43,53 --> 0:13:44,45
rocket scientists.


393
0:13:44,45 --> 0:13:46,19
And then they got long hair
because you could literally be


394
0:13:46,19 --> 0:13:47,45
talking to me, like, so then
I was just thinking


395
0:13:47,45 --> 0:13:50,13
I don't even know.


396
0:13:50,13 --> 0:13:51,79
And guys are going to go,
oh, you got long hair?


397
0:13:51,79 --> 0:13:52,12
Weiner!


398
0:13:52,12 --> 0:13:54,92
Oh, yeah, it's amazing.


399
0:13:54,92 --> 0:13:55,505
No idea.


400
0:13:55,505 --> 0:13:56,12
Love It.


401
0:13:56,12 --> 0:13:57,75
Your hair gets too long,
though, it gets creepy.


402
0:13:57,75 --> 0:13:58,54
Girls know that.


403
0:13:58,54 --> 0:13:59,47
OK, you.


404
0:13:59,47 --> 0:14:0,15
Just if it get too long.


405
0:14:0,15 --> 0:14:1,8
Yours is fine.


406
0:14:1,8 --> 0:14:2,96
If it gets too long, you've
got about two inches


407
0:14:2,96 --> 0:14:5,34
difference between really
hot, sexy supermodel--


408
0:14:5,34 --> 0:14:6,31
religious fanatic.


409
0:14:6,31 --> 0:14:7,746
It's right there.


410
0:14:7,746 --> 0:14:10,23
Go a little bit longer, it's
like, ooh, ethereal, pretty,


411
0:14:10,23 --> 0:14:12,14
sexy mouth, kissing,
girl everybody


412
0:14:12,14 --> 0:14:13,47
wants to make out with.


413
0:14:13,47 --> 0:14:14,91
Ooh, 1 of 12 brides,
right there.


414
0:14:14,91 --> 0:14:18,78
That's where it's very
uncomfortable, super


415
0:14:18,78 --> 0:14:19,48
uncomfortable.


416
0:14:19,48 --> 0:14:20,19
It's nice outside.


417
0:14:20,19 --> 0:14:22,2
This is a good time of year
because it's not too hot.


418
0:14:22,2 --> 0:14:22,77
It's not too cold.


419
0:14:22,77 --> 0:14:23,31
You know what I mean?


420
0:14:23,31 --> 0:14:24,7
They can wear like a fun
sleeveless number.


421
0:14:24,7 --> 0:14:25,51
And you're OK with it.


422
0:14:25,51 --> 0:14:26,5
Don't be afraid.


423
0:14:26,5 --> 0:14:26,76
This isn't live.


424
0:14:26,76 --> 0:14:29,1
It's OK.


425
0:14:29,1 --> 0:14:31,52
I think this is a girl's
favorite time of year because


426
0:14:31,52 --> 0:14:32,54
you get to transition.


427
0:14:32,54 --> 0:14:34,12
You to get rid of your
winter clothes.


428
0:14:34,12 --> 0:14:35,52
I happen to like
winter clothes.


429
0:14:35,52 --> 0:14:37,165
Actually, most girls like winter
clothes, even though I


430
0:14:37,165 --> 0:14:37,92
just said they didn't.


431
0:14:37,92 --> 0:14:39,35
Fuck it, it's live.


432
0:14:39,35 --> 0:14:39,69
We do.


433
0:14:39,69 --> 0:14:41,81
We love it because you get to
put on like fun layers.


434
0:14:41,81 --> 0:14:42,77
You get to do, like a scarf.


435
0:14:42,77 --> 0:14:43,78
She's got a head-- she
doesn't give a fuck.


436
0:14:43,78 --> 0:14:45,44
She's like, yeah, it's
half a scarf.


437
0:14:45,44 --> 0:14:46,91
It's on my head.


438
0:14:46,91 --> 0:14:49,47
I can pull it off-- new head
scarf, new leggings, UGGs.


439
0:14:49,47 --> 0:14:50,57
We love UGGs.


440
0:14:50,57 --> 0:14:53,22
The second it gets below like 70
degrees in Los Angeles, we


441
0:14:53,22 --> 0:14:55,21
go bat-shit crazy.


442
0:14:55,21 --> 0:14:56,67
We pop out of the ground
like gophers.


443
0:14:56,67 --> 0:14:57,856
Like [SNIFFS]--


444
0:14:57,856 --> 0:15:0,15
[LAUGHTER]


445
0:15:0,15 --> 0:15:1,18
ILIZA SHLESINGER: Stacy,
did you feel that?


446
0:15:1,18 --> 0:15:1,86
It was a breeze.


447
0:15:1,86 --> 0:15:2,89
Oh, my god, cinnamon,
[GRUFFLY]


448
0:15:2,89 --> 0:15:7,51
nutmeg, UGGs, leggings,
poof, poof, UGGs,


449
0:15:7,51 --> 0:15:9,77
cover up your cankles.


450
0:15:9,77 --> 0:15:10,67
[SCREECH]


451
0:15:10,67 --> 0:15:12,47
[APPLAUSE]


452
0:15:12,47 --> 0:15:13,53
ILIZA SHLESINGER:
Layer that shit.


453
0:15:13,53 --> 0:15:14,63
Just eat whatever you want.


454
0:15:14,63 --> 0:15:15,95
Layer a handful of almonds.


455
0:15:15,95 --> 0:15:16,59
Digest it.


456
0:15:16,59 --> 0:15:17,2
Layers.


457
0:15:17,2 --> 0:15:17,54
Ice cream.


458
0:15:17,54 --> 0:15:18,7
Layers.


459
0:15:18,7 --> 0:15:19,4
Leggings, do it.


460
0:15:19,4 --> 0:15:20,19
White trash formal pants.


461
0:15:20,19 --> 0:15:23,29
Leggings, UGGs, scarf,
cardigan.


462
0:15:23,29 --> 0:15:25,55
I don't know.


463
0:15:25,55 --> 0:15:26,19
That's super hot.


464
0:15:26,19 --> 0:15:26,81
I don't want to wear it.


465
0:15:26,81 --> 0:15:28,46
Bathing suit season's
coming up.


466
0:15:28,46 --> 0:15:29,42
The girls get nervous
about that.


467
0:15:29,42 --> 0:15:30,4
I don't mind.


468
0:15:30,4 --> 0:15:31,21
I don't mind bathing
suit season.


469
0:15:31,21 --> 0:15:34,15
I work out, obviously.


470
0:15:34,15 --> 0:15:36,43
The bathing suits out there that
would bother me, like the


471
0:15:36,43 --> 0:15:38,0
options out there.


472
0:15:38,0 --> 0:15:39,36
They don't even have
regular bikinis.


473
0:15:39,36 --> 0:15:40,76
Sometimes they have, like, girls
will use what looks like


474
0:15:40,76 --> 0:15:43,115
a two-piece with like
a piece of material.


475
0:15:43,115 --> 0:15:45,35
It's like this Judy Jetson thing
Paris Hilton wears it


476
0:15:45,35 --> 0:15:46,8
when she's hooking.


477
0:15:46,8 --> 0:15:48,3
It's just like one thing.


478
0:15:48,3 --> 0:15:49,82
What kind of a fucked-up
tan are you


479
0:15:49,82 --> 0:15:52,79
going to get from that?


480
0:15:52,79 --> 0:15:54,39
You're going to look like a
vivisection of a cow at a


481
0:15:54,39 --> 0:15:55,6
steakhouse.


482
0:15:55,6 --> 0:15:58,55
Just like white line, red, red,
flank, flank, vagina,


483
0:15:58,55 --> 0:16:2,67
just red haunches, filet.


484
0:16:2,67 --> 0:16:4,94
A lot of bathing suits have
hardware on them.


485
0:16:4,94 --> 0:16:6,9
I know these are for girls that
like to lounge around the


486
0:16:6,9 --> 0:16:9,25
Bellagio pool and pick up
clients for the most part.


487
0:16:9,25 --> 0:16:13,26
But I've seen bikinis that have
metal, like chain mail,


488
0:16:13,26 --> 0:16:16,486
like "Game of Throne" style
Khaleesi shit all over it.


489
0:16:16,486 --> 0:16:19,7
One of the intrinsic properties
of metal is that it


490
0:16:19,7 --> 0:16:19,97
conducts heat.


491
0:16:19,97 --> 0:16:20,98
You're going to lay outside.


492
0:16:20,98 --> 0:16:23,11
Then you're going to get welts
all of over your body, knowing


493
0:16:23,11 --> 0:16:24,25
that you pledged the
black fraternity.


494
0:16:24,25 --> 0:16:25,73
That's what's going to happen.


495
0:16:25,73 --> 0:16:27,94
Well, there's enough black
people here to get the joke.


496
0:16:27,94 --> 0:16:29,26
White people were just laughing
because they're


497
0:16:29,26 --> 0:16:30,33
nervous because I said black.


498
0:16:30,33 --> 0:16:32,1
And that's totally fine.


499
0:16:32,1 --> 0:16:32,57
I do this.


500
0:16:32,57 --> 0:16:33,69
That's OK.


501
0:16:33,69 --> 0:16:34,27
Nice time of year.


502
0:16:34,27 --> 0:16:36,59
All my friends are getting
married this time of the year


503
0:16:36,59 --> 0:16:37,99
because this is like the
weather is good.


504
0:16:37,99 --> 0:16:39,52
Like, we don't want to
chance the rain.


505
0:16:39,52 --> 0:16:41,936
And I want to do like
an outdoor wedding.


506
0:16:41,936 --> 0:16:42,71
I do outdoor.


507
0:16:42,71 --> 0:16:45,79
I planned the whole thing
on Pinterest.


508
0:16:45,79 --> 0:16:46,27
I did.


509
0:16:46,27 --> 0:16:49,31
It's an entire wedding
made of cheese.


510
0:16:49,31 --> 0:16:50,17
Outdoor wedding.


511
0:16:50,17 --> 0:16:53,56
One of my girlfriends got
married on Valentine's Day.


512
0:16:53,56 --> 0:16:55,45
And like, jokingly, I was like,
oh, my god, what was


513
0:16:55,45 --> 0:16:56,3
your theme?


514
0:16:56,3 --> 0:17:0,21
And she's, like, we did like
"love" under the stars, but


515
0:17:0,21 --> 0:17:1,46
like under the sea.


516
0:17:1,46 --> 0:17:4,319



517
0:17:4,319 --> 0:17:7,589
It's a wedding, not a prom.


518
0:17:7,589 --> 0:17:9,89
When I get married, I'm going
to get married the day after


519
0:17:9,89 --> 0:17:10,569
Valentine's Day.


520
0:17:10,569 --> 0:17:13,3
And my theme is going to
be 75% off chocolate.


521
0:17:13,3 --> 0:17:14,785
[APPLAUSE]


522
0:17:14,785 --> 0:17:16,35
ILIZA SHLESINGER: Ssst.


523
0:17:16,35 --> 0:17:18,745



524
0:17:18,745 --> 0:17:21,23
Thank you.


525
0:17:21,23 --> 0:17:22,71
Thank you PMS-ing women.


526
0:17:22,71 --> 0:17:25,16
And it's not going to be a
wedding as much as it's just


527
0:17:25,16 --> 0:17:27,21
going to be me alone in my
house listening to heavy


528
0:17:27,21 --> 0:17:29,45
metal, doing wall push-ups,
eating the heads off chocolate


529
0:17:29,45 --> 0:17:32,631
rabbits 'cause it's my day.


530
0:17:32,631 --> 0:17:33,63
That's super fun.


531
0:17:33,63 --> 0:17:35,19
All my friends get really
excited to get married.


532
0:17:35,19 --> 0:17:35,6
And they should.


533
0:17:35,6 --> 0:17:36,44
That's super fun.


534
0:17:36,44 --> 0:17:37,38
And they all get really excited


535
0:17:37,38 --> 0:17:38,36
to plan their weddings.


536
0:17:38,36 --> 0:17:39,7
That's great.


537
0:17:39,7 --> 0:17:42,74
I get really excited
to plan a breakup.


538
0:17:42,74 --> 0:17:43,15
OK?


539
0:17:43,15 --> 0:17:44,73
I put some time and
effort into this.


540
0:17:44,73 --> 0:17:47,24
Just so you know when you date
me, you get a customized


541
0:17:47,24 --> 0:17:48,91
breakup, OK?


542
0:17:48,91 --> 0:17:49,79
I put time into this.


543
0:17:49,79 --> 0:17:50,9
I put thought.


544
0:17:50,9 --> 0:17:50,91
There's no template.


545
0:17:50,91 --> 0:17:52,2
There's no, oh, my god.


546
0:17:52,2 --> 0:17:52,87
It's me, it's not you.


547
0:17:52,87 --> 0:17:53,82
No, it's you, motherfucker.


548
0:17:53,82 --> 0:17:55,41
Here's a list of reasons why.


549
0:17:55,41 --> 0:17:56,49
OK?


550
0:17:56,49 --> 0:17:59,6
These are hand-hewn,
handcrafted, hecho in


551
0:17:59,6 --> 0:18:2,68
California, "tailor-made to
highlight your insecurities"


552
0:18:2,68 --> 0:18:4,81
specific breakups.


553
0:18:4,81 --> 0:18:7,76
Guys, just so you know, us,
girls, we're bat-shit crazy.


554
0:18:7,76 --> 0:18:10,89
And from the second we start
dating you, we keep tabs on


555
0:18:10,89 --> 0:18:13,26
everything you do wrong.


556
0:18:13,26 --> 0:18:16,1
So that if and when we decide to
break up with you because,


557
0:18:16,1 --> 0:18:19,99
I don't know, the wind changes
direction; we can then refer


558
0:18:19,99 --> 0:18:23,7
to said list and extrapolate one
isolated incident and use


559
0:18:23,7 --> 0:18:26,4
that as the piece de resistance
of this breakup


560
0:18:26,4 --> 0:18:28,61
masterpiece.


561
0:18:28,61 --> 0:18:30,55
Dated a guy recently, I wanted
to do a rain breakup.


562
0:18:30,55 --> 0:18:32,75
I thought that would
be super fun.


563
0:18:32,75 --> 0:18:35,53
The rain, yeah, rain--
emblematic of the tears shed


564
0:18:35,53 --> 0:18:37,63
during the courtship,
totally made sense.


565
0:18:37,63 --> 0:18:40,46
Love the symbology
of it, rain.


566
0:18:40,46 --> 0:18:42,43
Every girl's wanted to have
a rain breakup, right?


567
0:18:42,43 --> 0:18:44,294
Every girl, but the black
girls, are like, hm-mm.


568
0:18:44,294 --> 0:18:47,2



569
0:18:47,2 --> 0:18:48,69
Because I want to do a rain
breakup, go on the rain.


570
0:18:48,69 --> 0:18:49,19
It's raining.


571
0:18:49,19 --> 0:18:51,69
You get to run out, like don't
follow me, which in girl talk


572
0:18:51,69 --> 0:18:53,68
means follow me right now.


573
0:18:53,68 --> 0:18:55,76
In the rain, maybe you got a
white shirt on, tits out,


574
0:18:55,76 --> 0:18:57,6
nipples, go under the rain.


575
0:18:57,6 --> 0:18:59,2
Hair, very-- no, but
you're out in rain.


576
0:18:59,2 --> 0:19:0,25
Makeup running.


577
0:19:0,25 --> 0:19:1,67
Run into woods-- don't
run into the woods.


578
0:19:1,67 --> 0:19:3,55
But just rain.


579
0:19:3,55 --> 0:19:5,64
Actually, if you can find woods
in LA, good for you.


580
0:19:5,64 --> 0:19:5,96
Go find.


581
0:19:5,96 --> 0:19:6,95
That's great.


582
0:19:6,95 --> 0:19:7,86
Rain breakup.


583
0:19:7,86 --> 0:19:9,92
I live in Southern California,
you can't do a rain breakup


584
0:19:9,92 --> 0:19:11,63
with Southern California.


585
0:19:11,63 --> 0:19:14,29
You're going to smell
like a dirty sheep.


586
0:19:14,29 --> 0:19:16,34
I had on a wool sweater one
time, and it was raining.


587
0:19:16,34 --> 0:19:17,35
I can't do that.


588
0:19:17,35 --> 0:19:18,65
No one's going to miss you
if you're in a wool


589

sweater in the rain.

up with me?

[SHEEP-LIKE]


593
0:19:21,765 --> 0:19:24,51
I'm breaking up with you.

0:19:24,51 --> 0:19:27,27
[BLEATS]


595
0:19:27,27 --> 0:19:27,426
[NORMAL VOICE]


596
0:19:27,426 --> 0:19:28,88
Had the perfect breakup plan.


597
0:19:28,88 --> 0:19:31,79
I dated a guy for
three months.


598
0:19:31,79 --> 0:19:33,99
So we were at a bar.


599
0:19:33,99 --> 0:19:34,7
And we're hanging out.


600
0:19:34,7 --> 0:19:36,48
So first date, we're drinking,
hanging out,


601
0:19:36,48 --> 0:19:37,24
taking muscle relaxers.


602
0:19:37,24 --> 0:19:38,19
It's a fun first date.


603
0:19:38,19 --> 0:19:39,18
So we are just talking.


604
0:19:39,18 --> 0:19:41,13
And we're having the obligatory
first date


605
0:19:41,13 --> 0:19:41,9
conversation.


606
0:19:41,9 --> 0:19:43,5
I'm like, so what do you do?


607
0:19:43,5 --> 0:19:44,523
Where are you from?


608
0:19:44,523 --> 0:19:45,41
[CHIRPS]


609
0:19:45,41 --> 0:19:47,17
Just talking.


610
0:19:47,17 --> 0:19:49,2
What's your middle name?


611
0:19:49,2 --> 0:19:50,84
And he's, like, my middle
name is Paul.


612
0:19:50,84 --> 0:19:54,26
Now, reciprocity in a normal
conversation would dictate


613
0:19:54,26 --> 0:19:58,61
that his next question to me
should have been, [HONKS]


614
0:19:58,61 --> 0:20:0,63
That's right.


615
0:20:0,63 --> 0:20:2,81
But he never asked me
my middle name.


616
0:20:2,81 --> 0:20:3,29
And I [GRUFFLY]


617
0:20:3,29 --> 0:20:4,84
fucking remembered that shit.


618
0:20:4,84 --> 0:20:7,62



619
0:20:7,62 --> 0:20:7,675
[NORMAL VOICE]


620
0:20:7,675 --> 0:20:9,27
You're not going to ask a girl
her middle name, it's going to


621
0:20:9,27 --> 0:20:12,6
ruin our psyche because as a
girl, you interpret that very


622
0:20:12,6 --> 0:20:13,28
differently than a guy would.


623
0:20:13,28 --> 0:20:15,5
You don't ask my middle name,
it's, like, he doesn't want to


624
0:20:15,5 --> 0:20:17,0
know my middle name, doesn't
want to get to know me,


625
0:20:17,0 --> 0:20:18,5
doesn't care about my
thoughts, my fears,


626
0:20:18,5 --> 0:20:18,64
my hopes, my dreams.


627
0:20:18,64 --> 0:20:19,62
Doesn't want to have
a relationship.


628
0:20:19,62 --> 0:20:20,41
Doesn't want to get married.


629
0:20:20,41 --> 0:20:22,16
We're never going
to have a baby.


630
0:20:22,16 --> 0:20:23,41
That's the way that goes.


631
0:20:23,41 --> 0:20:25,995



632
0:20:25,995 --> 0:20:28,48
So I had the perfect
breakup plan for


633
0:20:28,48 --> 0:20:29,65
him, just so you know.


634
0:20:29,65 --> 0:20:32,2
Before I tell you the perfect
breakup, the real way I broke


635
0:20:32,2 --> 0:20:33,84
up with him, the fantasy
never happened.


636
0:20:33,84 --> 0:20:37,21
The real way we broke up was
yours truly ended up getting a


637
0:20:37,21 --> 0:20:39,71
little drunk one night and
texting him something to the


638
0:20:39,71 --> 0:20:42,14
effect of, you don't even watch
"Breaking Bad," so how


639
0:20:42,14 --> 0:20:42,82
can we be together?


640
0:20:42,82 --> 0:20:45,78
That's really how we broke up.


641
0:20:45,78 --> 0:20:48,14
But in closing, I
will tell this.


642
0:20:48,14 --> 0:20:49,56
So here's the breakup
I wanted to do.


643
0:20:49,56 --> 0:20:52,65
So I wanted in my fantasy-- are
you ready for my fantasy?


644
0:20:52,65 --> 0:20:54,72
I'm going to pin this later--
in my fantasy, I will be


645
0:20:54,72 --> 0:20:55,98
sitting on the couch.


646
0:20:55,98 --> 0:20:59,3
And I would start a fight
out of nowhere.


647
0:20:59,3 --> 0:21:1,56
When you're a girl,
you can do that.


648
0:21:1,56 --> 0:21:3,71
Guys think we're crazy anyway,
we may as well play that card.


649
0:21:3,71 --> 0:21:4,66
That's fine.


650
0:21:4,66 --> 0:21:7,9
Just the fact that I might have
to have a baby one day is


651
0:21:7,9 --> 0:21:10,54
enough for me to act like
a nut job today.


652
0:21:10,54 --> 0:21:11,43
So I pick a fight.


653
0:21:11,43 --> 0:21:12,37
Like he would cough.


654
0:21:12,37 --> 0:21:12,89
[COUGH]


655
0:21:12,89 --> 0:21:16,22
And I'd be like, what
did you say?


656
0:21:16,22 --> 0:21:17,6
What did you say?


657
0:21:17,6 --> 0:21:18,52
If a girl does this,
fucking duck and


658
0:21:18,52 --> 0:21:20,33
cover, buddy, all right?


659
0:21:20,33 --> 0:21:21,44
What did you say?


660
0:21:21,44 --> 0:21:22,93
So you'd be like,
you know what?


661
0:21:22,93 --> 0:21:23,235
Forget it.


662
0:21:23,235 --> 0:21:24,72
And I would start crying.


663
0:21:24,72 --> 0:21:27,21
But the way I'd start crying is
unbeknownst to him, I would


664
0:21:27,21 --> 0:21:27,83
turn around.


665
0:21:27,83 --> 0:21:29,78
And I would pluck a nose
hair out of my nose.


666
0:21:29,78 --> 0:21:30,57
So I'd start involuntarily.


667
0:21:30,57 --> 0:21:31,71
You ever plucked a nose hair?


668
0:21:31,71 --> 0:21:32,73
Fucking hurts.


669
0:21:32,73 --> 0:21:34,42
Why are you crying?


670
0:21:34,42 --> 0:21:35,35
You want big tears.


671
0:21:35,35 --> 0:21:36,43
You're going to get a
guy to feel bad, you


672
0:21:36,43 --> 0:21:37,39
want crocodile tears.


673
0:21:37,39 --> 0:21:40,5
You want the kind of tears the
girls on "The Bachelor" cry


674
0:21:40,5 --> 0:21:42,4
when they get eliminated.


675
0:21:42,4 --> 0:21:43,76
Big old French-tip
nails just--


676
0:21:43,76 --> 0:21:48,99



677
0:21:48,99 --> 0:21:52,14
I don't think Becky is here
for the right reasons.


678
0:21:52,14 --> 0:21:53,34
The reason women
cry like this--


679
0:21:53,34 --> 0:21:56,56
I found out now that I'm 30-- is
because we can maintain the


680
0:21:56,56 --> 0:21:58,9
integrity of our eyeliner while
still agitating collagen


681
0:21:58,9 --> 0:22:0,72
production.


682
0:22:0,72 --> 0:22:1,5
[FAKE WEEPING]


683
0:22:1,5 --> 0:22:3,94
And so we cry.


684
0:22:3,94 --> 0:22:6,7
You ever been in a fight with
someone and you're crying and


685
0:22:6,7 --> 0:22:9,22
you're kind of over being sad,
but you want to keep crying to


686
0:22:9,22 --> 0:22:10,14
make them feel bad?


687
0:22:10,14 --> 0:22:11,71
So you start thinking about
other things, like your mom


688
0:22:11,71 --> 0:22:15,14
dying and the Holocaust, just
to keep the thoughts going?


689
0:22:15,14 --> 0:22:16,4
He'd be, like, what's
your problem?


690
0:22:16,4 --> 0:22:16,79
And I'm, like, forget it!


691
0:22:16,79 --> 0:22:18,61
And I would run out
of my own house.


692
0:22:18,61 --> 0:22:21,11
I'd sort of run into the street
because I want to have


693
0:22:21,11 --> 0:22:23,21
this out in the street,
street fighter style.


694
0:22:23,21 --> 0:22:25,82
Now, prior to starting this
fight, I would have set up


695
0:22:25,82 --> 0:22:27,94
orange parking cones
in the street.


696
0:22:27,94 --> 0:22:28,91
Because if you're going
to fight in the


697
0:22:28,91 --> 0:22:31,83
street, safety first.


698
0:22:31,83 --> 0:22:35,27
You cannot have a car coming in
and out of your trap of the


699
0:22:35,27 --> 0:22:36,25
middle of your fight.


700
0:22:36,25 --> 0:22:38,16
You can't be in the middle of
a fight and risk a Buick


701
0:22:38,16 --> 0:22:38,57
coming through.


702
0:22:38,57 --> 0:22:39,74
Do they even make
Buicks anymore?


703
0:22:39,74 --> 0:22:40,85
I don't even know
what cars are.


704
0:22:40,85 --> 0:22:42,55
So we'll be out there.


705
0:22:42,55 --> 0:22:43,65
We'll be fighting.


706
0:22:43,65 --> 0:22:44,72
Have the whole thing.


707
0:22:44,72 --> 0:22:46,69
If a car comes through, you're
going to lose momentum.


708
0:22:46,69 --> 0:22:47,79
You might stop fighting.


709
0:22:47,79 --> 0:22:48,22
You might kiss.


710
0:22:48,22 --> 0:22:48,87
You might make up.


711
0:22:48,87 --> 0:22:49,9
But we don't fucking want that.


712
0:22:49,9 --> 0:22:50,96
OK?


713
0:22:50,96 --> 0:22:52,46
I'd run out and be,
like, get away!


714
0:22:52,46 --> 0:22:54,4
I would yell so the neighbors
would come out.


715
0:22:54,4 --> 0:22:55,47
And they start watching.


716
0:22:55,47 --> 0:22:57,36
Yeah, because I need an
audience, obviously.


717
0:22:57,36 --> 0:22:58,88
So you come out.


718
0:22:58,88 --> 0:22:59,87
Like, don't touch me.


719
0:22:59,87 --> 0:23:1,1
Iliza, what is your problem?


720
0:23:1,1 --> 0:23:2,7
No, I don't want
to talk to you.


721
0:23:2,7 --> 0:23:3,2
Get back inside.


722
0:23:3,2 --> 0:23:4,93
You don't tell me what to do.


723
0:23:4,93 --> 0:23:7,89
I'm an independent woman,
I listen to Beyonce.


724
0:23:7,89 --> 0:23:9,1
Go back inside.


725
0:23:9,1 --> 0:23:9,92
You're acting crazy.


726
0:23:9,92 --> 0:23:10,81
What did you say?


727
0:23:10,81 --> 0:23:12,21
I'm just saying, Iliza.


728
0:23:12,21 --> 0:23:12,99
Go back inside.


729
0:23:12,99 --> 0:23:14,2
I don't want to go
back inside.


730
0:23:14,2 --> 0:23:14,52
Why not?


731
0:23:14,52 --> 0:23:17,5
I just feel like this isn't
working, OK, Gary?


732
0:23:17,5 --> 0:23:18,75
No, not Gary.


733
0:23:18,75 --> 0:23:21,11



734
0:23:21,11 --> 0:23:22,2
What is your problem?


735
0:23:22,2 --> 0:23:23,66
I just feel like we don't
even know each other.


736
0:23:23,66 --> 0:23:24,7
What do you mean we don't
really know each other?


737
0:23:24,7 --> 0:23:25,9
I feel like we don't
communicate.


738
0:23:25,9 --> 0:23:27,8
We don't even know each other.


739
0:23:27,8 --> 0:23:28,58
What do you mean we don't
even know each other?


740
0:23:28,58 --> 0:23:29,87
Of course, we know each other.


741
0:23:29,87 --> 0:23:30,91
Really?

0:23:30,91 --> 0:23:31,53
[GRUFFLY]


743
0:23:31,53 --> 0:23:34,202

SEAN O' CONNOR: You're good.


747
0:23:51,79 --> 0:23:52,27
You're good.


748
0:23:52,27 --> 0:23:54,224
Give it up for Iliza.


749
0:23:54,224 --> 0:23:56,16
Give it up for her.


750
0:23:56,16 --> 0:23:57,13
Wow.

for your next comic.

ASpecialThing Records called

0:24:17,62 --> 0:24:23,5
JIM HAMILTON: Oh, good-looking
ladies out here.


758
0:24:23,5 --> 0:24:27,8
I don't have time to hit on
you all, individually.


759
0:24:27,8 --> 0:24:29,52
So I'm just going to put
out a pickup line.


760
0:24:29,52 --> 0:24:34,81
And if you're interested, come
see me after the show.

0:24:34,81 --> 0:24:38,73
[CLEARS THROAT]


762
0:24:38,73 --> 0:24:42,1
Damn, girl.


763
0:24:42,1 --> 0:24:45,51
You must be suicidal thoughts
because you've been running


764
0:24:45,51 --> 0:24:47,1
through my mind all day.


765
0:24:47,1 --> 0:24:54,26



766
0:24:54,26 --> 0:24:56,155
Had Chinese food for
lunch today.


767
0:24:56,155 --> 0:24:59,2



768
0:24:59,2 --> 0:25:0,24
Overheard these ladies
talking.


769
0:25:0,24 --> 0:25:3,4
Then one lady told her friend
that she recently went on a


770
0:25:3,4 --> 0:25:5,5
first date with a comedian.


771
0:25:5,5 --> 0:25:8,62
But she wasn't going to go on
a second date because all


772
0:25:8,62 --> 0:25:10,585
comedians are emotionally
damaged.


773
0:25:10,585 --> 0:25:13,45



774
0:25:13,45 --> 0:25:16,54
I turned around, I was about
the correct her, but then I


775
0:25:16,54 --> 0:25:18,4
just started crying
for no reason.


776
0:25:18,4 --> 0:25:21,8



777
0:25:21,8 --> 0:25:26,4
My fortune cookie read,
you will die alone.


778
0:25:26,4 --> 0:25:29,22
Ch-uh, yeah, in bed.


779
0:25:29,22 --> 0:25:34,9



780
0:25:34,9 --> 0:25:37,97
I really think I'll
be alone forever.


781
0:25:37,97 --> 0:25:42,48
Pretty decent chance I'd be
buried in a mass grave.


782
0:25:42,48 --> 0:25:43,98
I had a girlfriend once--


783
0:25:43,98 --> 0:25:45,23
play along.


784
0:25:45,23 --> 0:25:47,74



785
0:25:47,74 --> 0:25:52,57
She broke up with me because she
said I talked about Better


786
0:25:52,57 --> 0:25:53,98
Than Ezra too much.


787
0:25:53,98 --> 0:25:56,57



788
0:25:56,57 --> 0:25:58,3
Didn't agree with her.


789
0:25:58,3 --> 0:26:0,34
But it's not worth
fighting about.


790
0:26:0,34 --> 0:26:3,14
So I texted her to apologize.


791
0:26:3,14 --> 0:26:11,7
But the text auto-corrected
to "Better than Ezra."


792
0:26:11,7 --> 0:26:15,55
What a day, what a day.


793
0:26:15,55 --> 0:26:18,73
Today has been like a Red
Hot Chili Peppers song.


794
0:26:18,73 --> 0:26:19,98
Not good.


795
0:26:19,98 --> 0:26:25,3

I got so drunk last night, I
woke up this morning with a

penis drawn on my forehead.


798
0:26:32,38 --> 0:26:34,425
Yeah, and I live alone.

0:26:39,35 --> 0:26:41,312
I blame my doctor.

0:26:41,312 --> 0:26:44,16
My doctor told me to
drink more whisky.


802
0:26:44,16 --> 0:26:47,2
Well, his exact words were,
drink less beer.


803
0:26:47,2 --> 0:26:48,65
[CHUCKLES]


804
0:26:48,65 --> 0:26:49,95
But I knew what he meant.


805
0:26:49,95 --> 0:26:52,722
[CLEARS THROAT]


806
0:26:52,722 --> 0:26:56,37
If you know the cure for
elephantitis, I'm all ears.


807
0:26:56,37 --> 0:27:3,18



808
0:27:3,18 --> 0:27:5,78
Oh, man, be careful if
you're drinking.


809
0:27:5,78 --> 0:27:8,8
I get these horrible nightmares
when I'm drinking.


810
0:27:8,8 --> 0:27:11,55
In my nightmare, I see
my own tombstone.


811
0:27:11,55 --> 0:27:15,37
My tombstone reads, here
lies Jim Hamilton.


812
0:27:15,37 --> 0:27:20,16
He left this world just as he
entered it, face down in an


813
0:27:20,16 --> 0:27:21,41
Applebee's toilet.


814
0:27:21,41 --> 0:27:27,81



815
0:27:27,81 --> 0:27:30,955
You never forget which word you
lost the Spelling Bee on.


816
0:27:30,955 --> 0:27:32,9
I was about eight years old.


817
0:27:32,9 --> 0:27:37,13
And I lost on the word
"faggot." Oh,


818
0:27:37,13 --> 0:27:38,89
I spelled it correctly.


819
0:27:38,89 --> 0:27:40,75
Unfortunately, it was
my father who


820
0:27:40,75 --> 0:27:42,466
yelled it from the audience.


821
0:27:42,466 --> 0:27:53,4
[LAUGHTER]


822
0:27:53,4 --> 0:27:56,55
JIM HAMILTON: Oh, man,
I was an awkward kid.


823
0:27:56,55 --> 0:28:0,28
I think I've aged like a fine
wine locked up in some rich


824
0:28:0,28 --> 0:28:1,53
guy's cellar.


825
0:28:1,53 --> 0:28:4,72



826
0:28:4,72 --> 0:28:7,2
Recently, I went to a
baby christening.


827
0:28:7,2 --> 0:28:8,43
It was a disaster.


828
0:28:8,43 --> 0:28:11,25
It took me, like, eight tries to
break the champagne bottle.


829
0:28:11,25 --> 0:28:15,66



830
0:28:15,66 --> 0:28:19,38
My dad started watching "The
Wire." And he cannot stop


831
0:28:19,38 --> 0:28:21,44
saying the N-word--


832
0:28:21,44 --> 0:28:22,69
not in that order.


833
0:28:22,69 --> 0:28:25,95



834
0:28:25,95 --> 0:28:28,52
Lady Justice is blind.


835
0:28:28,52 --> 0:28:30,35
So it's a good thing minorities
have an accent.


836
0:28:30,35 --> 0:28:35,32



837
0:28:35,32 --> 0:28:36,58
I don't care.


838
0:28:36,58 --> 0:28:39,72



839
0:28:39,72 --> 0:28:43,78
I don't care how many Africans
have to die,


840
0:28:43,78 --> 0:28:45,3
blood oranges are delicious.


841
0:28:45,3 --> 0:28:49,47



842
0:28:49,47 --> 0:28:51,93
Kraft Foods.


843
0:28:51,93 --> 0:28:56,65
Kraft Foods will never print
September 11 as the expiration


844
0:28:56,65 --> 0:28:59,58
date on any of their products
for fear of


845
0:28:59,58 --> 0:29:2,12
upsetting their customers.


846
0:29:2,12 --> 0:29:5,3
What kind of world do we
live in where I can


847
0:29:5,3 --> 0:29:6,76
just make that up?


848
0:29:6,76 --> 0:29:11,1



849
0:29:11,1 --> 0:29:13,5
The Commodores had a song
called, "Easy Like Sunday


850
0:29:13,5 --> 0:29:18,4
Morning." It was written by
Lionel Richie who, apparently,


851
0:29:18,4 --> 0:29:21,56
has never had hangover
diarrhea.


852
0:29:21,56 --> 0:29:22,94
Enjoy the rest of
the show, guys.


853
0:29:22,94 --> 0:29:24,88
Thank you.

SEAN O'CONNOR: Thank you.


856
0:29:31,4 --> 0:29:33,474
Give it up for Jim Hamilton.


857
0:29:33,474 --> 0:29:34,956
Give it up for him.


858
0:29:34,956 --> 0:29:36,438
Give it up for him.


859
0:29:36,438 --> 0:29:42,366



860
0:29:42,366 --> 0:29:45,154
Yes, want to keep this
show moving?


861
0:29:45,154 --> 0:29:48,9
You, guys, want to keep
this show moving?


862
0:29:48,9 --> 0:29:49,12
Here we go.


863
0:29:49,12 --> 0:29:51,77
Your next comic, he has a show
coming out on Comedy Central


864
0:29:51,77 --> 0:29:53,71
called "Enjoy It." Please
put your hands


865
0:29:53,71 --> 0:29:56,29
together for Brody Stevens.


866
0:29:56,29 --> 0:29:57,27
[APPLAUSE]


867
0:29:57,27 --> 0:29:58,74
BRODY STEVENS: Yeah!

869
0:30:12,95 --> 0:30:16,42



870
0:30:16,42 --> 0:30:17,6
BRODY STEVENS: I'm
a little nervous.


871
0:30:17,6 --> 0:30:19,4
This is my first TED talk.


872
0:30:19,4 --> 0:30:23,53



873
0:30:23,53 --> 0:30:25,43
I have to keep my set tight.


874
0:30:25,43 --> 0:30:28,83
I'm double-parked in the
handicap spot outside.


875
0:30:28,83 --> 0:30:31,11



876
0:30:31,11 --> 0:30:32,3
I'm very good-looking.


877
0:30:32,3 --> 0:30:33,895
I've done a lot of modeling
in Serbia.


878
0:30:33,895 --> 0:30:38,3



879
0:30:38,3 --> 0:30:39,16
Who's on Lamictal?


880
0:30:39,16 --> 0:30:40,85
Who takes medication here?


881
0:30:40,85 --> 0:30:44,16
You got it, I do.


882
0:30:44,16 --> 0:30:46,26
$10 co-pay.


883
0:30:46,26 --> 0:30:51,75
Lamictal, Latuda, Lexapro,
Zocor, klonopin.


884
0:30:51,75 --> 0:30:54,39



885
0:30:54,39 --> 0:30:58,23
That's four for the brain
and one for the vein.


886
0:30:58,23 --> 0:30:59,96
You got it.


887
0:30:59,96 --> 0:31:3,55
Healthy, doing smoothies,
doing fiber.


888
0:31:3,55 --> 0:31:4,84
This guy looks excited.


889
0:31:4,84 --> 0:31:9,49
Looks like he got shut out
of Coachella, Day 8.


890
0:31:9,49 --> 0:31:11,56
Stay with me, YouTube.


891
0:31:11,56 --> 0:31:12,67
You got it.


892
0:31:12,67 --> 0:31:14,3
You took down my page.


893
0:31:14,3 --> 0:31:15,5
Why?


894
0:31:15,5 --> 0:31:17,91
You said it was a Viacom
violation, prove it.


895
0:31:17,91 --> 0:31:21,422
Your robots made mistakes
up at Google California.


896
0:31:21,422 --> 0:31:25,4



897
0:31:25,4 --> 0:31:29,45
You know Google owns YouTube,
like McDonald's used to own


898
0:31:29,45 --> 0:31:31,43
Chipotle, but they broke away.


899
0:31:31,43 --> 0:31:33,18
Did you guys know that?


900
0:31:33,18 --> 0:31:34,29
You'll learn a lot from me.


901
0:31:34,29 --> 0:31:36,42
I'm very smart.


902
0:31:36,42 --> 0:31:39,93
I'm wearing glasses,

0:31:42,53 --> 0:31:43,47

905
0:31:43,47 --> 0:31:46,46
Positive energy, you got
it, very intense.


906
0:31:46,46 --> 0:31:47,935
I get BO in the shower.


907
0:31:47,935 --> 0:31:52,71



908
0:31:52,71 --> 0:31:54,89
I am doing a show,
you heard it.


909
0:31:54,89 --> 0:31:56,47
It's on Comedy Central.


910
0:31:56,47 --> 0:31:58,79
You think I would have
a house in The Hills?


911
0:31:58,79 --> 0:31:59,75
I don't.


912
0:31:59,75 --> 0:32:2,12
I live in a one-bedroom
apartment on


913
0:32:2,12 --> 0:32:4,43
Magnolia in the Valley.


914
0:32:4,43 --> 0:32:7,87
I need more money, Viacom.


915
0:32:7,87 --> 0:32:13,23
I'm sharing a banana
with a Samoan guy.


916
0:32:13,23 --> 0:32:14,42
What's going on here?


917
0:32:14,42 --> 0:32:16,91
I'm losing my voice.


918
0:32:16,91 --> 0:32:20,27
I'm going back to Red Robin,
I'm doing fry refills.


919
0:32:20,27 --> 0:32:22,5
I'm sleeping on an
air mattress.


920
0:32:22,5 --> 0:32:24,42
But I got a show at
Comedy Central.


921
0:32:24,42 --> 0:32:25,93
Viacom, wake up!


922
0:32:25,93 --> 0:32:39,51
I'll put you on "60 Minutes."
Hold on, I have Bell's palsy.


923
0:32:39,51 --> 0:32:40,17
That's a joke.


924
0:32:40,17 --> 0:32:42,22
That's a joke.


925
0:32:42,22 --> 0:32:43,23
Oh, don't boo me.


926
0:32:43,23 --> 0:32:44,45
How dare you?


927
0:32:44,45 --> 0:32:46,55
This is my YouTube chance.


928
0:32:46,55 --> 0:32:47,95
Hello, Dubai.


929
0:32:47,95 --> 0:32:49,74
Hello, South Africa.


930
0:32:49,74 --> 0:32:51,91
Hello, Israel, shalom.


931
0:32:51,91 --> 0:32:54,97
I'm coming home, brother.


932
0:32:54,97 --> 0:32:55,58
You got it.


933
0:32:55,58 --> 0:32:56,42
I got a yamaka.


934
0:32:56,42 --> 0:33:0,12
I got it at Lids, 7 and
3/8, New Era, fitted.


935
0:33:0,12 --> 0:33:3,15



936
0:33:3,15 --> 0:33:4,0
This guy's funny.


937
0:33:4,0 --> 0:33:5,36
He's got hands under
the table.


938
0:33:5,36 --> 0:33:6,64
Why are you playing
pocket pool?


939
0:33:6,64 --> 0:33:8,9
This guy's touching
his crotch.


940
0:33:8,9 --> 0:33:12,55
I got a Jerry Sandusky type
here, touching himself, trying


941
0:33:12,55 --> 0:33:16,91
to distract me on Google Tube.


942
0:33:16,91 --> 0:33:18,16
Don't distract me.


943
0:33:18,16 --> 0:33:19,42
There's a camera right there.


944
0:33:19,42 --> 0:33:24,16
Yes, Steven Brody Stevens,
looking good, getting chicks.


945
0:33:24,16 --> 0:33:28,24
One lucky lady tonight is going
to be chosen out of this


946
0:33:28,24 --> 0:33:31,1
crowd, is going to hang
out with me tonight.


947
0:33:31,1 --> 0:33:32,47
What do you think about that?


948
0:33:32,47 --> 0:33:34,764
[APPLAUSE]


949
0:33:34,764 --> 0:33:36,9
BRODY STEVENS: Yeah!


950
0:33:36,9 --> 0:33:37,85
Hooking up.


951
0:33:37,85 --> 0:33:43,11
Venus Beach, under the pier,
playing some soccer.


952
0:33:43,11 --> 0:33:45,41
Then we'll go on the boardwalk,
like Jack Tripper


953
0:33:45,41 --> 0:33:49,52
on "Three's Company."
We'll reenact that.


954
0:33:49,52 --> 0:33:54,42
And then I'll hold you over the
bluffs and then push you


955
0:33:54,42 --> 0:34:2,15
over and then rappel down and
save you and have somebody


956
0:34:2,15 --> 0:34:3,84
film it and put it on YouTube.


957
0:34:3,84 --> 0:34:6,4



958
0:34:6,4 --> 0:34:9,77
That's how you make stuff.


959
0:34:9,77 --> 0:34:11,89
I just thought of a movie.


960
0:34:11,89 --> 0:34:16,29
A guy meets a chick in a show,
hops on his moped parked in a


961
0:34:16,29 --> 0:34:18,9
handicap spot.


962
0:34:18,9 --> 0:34:19,37
They're sharing a helmet.


963
0:34:19,37 --> 0:34:21,949



964
0:34:21,949 --> 0:34:23,52
I got a big head.


965
0:34:23,52 --> 0:34:26,429
I'm looking for a small-headed
woman in here.


966
0:34:26,429 --> 0:34:27,969
Your head can fit on--


967
0:34:27,969 --> 0:34:29,11
I love your headband.


968
0:34:29,11 --> 0:34:30,13
It's very good.


969
0:34:30,13 --> 0:34:31,929
Guys, give it a go for
Olivia Newton-John.


970
0:34:31,929 --> 0:34:33,11
Let her hear it.

[SINGING]


972
0:34:33,237 --> 0:34:36,5
Let's get physical, physical.


973
0:34:36,5 --> 0:34:39,21
I want to get physical.


974
0:34:39,21 --> 0:34:41,17
Let's get into physical.


975
0:34:41,17 --> 0:34:44,19
Let me hear your body
talk, your body--

[STOPS SINGING]


977
0:34:44,25 --> 0:34:44,84
You like me.

0:34:44,84 --> 0:34:47,65
You're into me.


979
0:34:47,65 --> 0:34:49,29
I'm going to hook up tonight.


980
0:34:49,29 --> 0:34:51,98
Yeah!


981
0:34:51,98 --> 0:34:53,96
How many people saw me
in "The Hangover"?


982
0:34:53,96 --> 0:34:56,71



983
0:34:56,71 --> 0:35:0,33
Not that many people,
I get that.


984
0:35:0,33 --> 0:35:3,13
I get that not many people
recognized me from "The


985
0:35:3,13 --> 0:35:6,44
Hangover." I was also in
"Hangover 2." I was in the


986
0:35:6,44 --> 0:35:7,46
movie "Due Date."


987
0:35:7,46 --> 0:35:9,47
But I don't get recognized
in public.


988
0:35:9,47 --> 0:35:10,42
And it bothers me.


989
0:35:10,42 --> 0:35:11,12
You know why?


990
0:35:11,12 --> 0:35:13,0
You know why I don't
get recognized?


991
0:35:13,0 --> 0:35:16,29
Because I'm a good actor,
that's why.


992
0:35:16,29 --> 0:35:18,9
And I should've kept
that joke tighter.


993
0:35:18,9 --> 0:35:20,28
It was too long.


994
0:35:20,28 --> 0:35:24,23
I dragged you through the
mud to get to a chuckle.


995
0:35:24,23 --> 0:35:29,41
Shame on me for using your ears
and your mind to listen


996
0:35:29,41 --> 0:35:32,5
to a joke that didn't
have a good payoff.


997
0:35:32,5 --> 0:35:36,25
I should quit comedy
right now.


998
0:35:36,25 --> 0:35:38,92
No.

0:35:38,92 --> 0:35:39,71
Let me relax.

0:35:40,2 --> 0:35:42,25

Oh, wow!

Hello.


1014

And pause and rewind.


1015
0:36:7,9 --> 0:36:9,14
Yeah.


1016
0:36:9,14 --> 0:36:11,9

the whole thing.

But I'm different.

I'm bloated right now.


1025
0:36:24,31 --> 0:36:28,26

for lunch.


1026

Guys, great news.


1027

Ready, ready, yeah.

Woo.

Your next comic is one of the
stars on an up-and-coming NBC

0:37:53,365 --> 0:37:55,35

one of my favorite comics.

walks away.

RON FUNCHES: You know, when I
first started, a lot of people


1076
0:38:32,96 --> 0:38:35,97
told me I wouldn't make
it in comedy.


1077
0:38:35,97 --> 0:38:38,86
Well, I proved them wrong.

I mean you no harm.

0:39:5,35 --> 0:39:9,1
So please don't come at me.


1086
0:39:9,1 --> 0:39:11,57
That's a conversation I
had with a kitty cat


1087
0:39:11,57 --> 0:39:12,82
several days ago.


1088
0:39:12,82 --> 0:39:20,1

It's also now the slogan for
Black History Month.

0:39:22,485 --> 0:39:27,18



1091
0:39:27,18 --> 0:39:29,19
I like that you responded
to Mr. Whiteface.


1092
0:39:29,19 --> 0:39:33,29



1093
0:39:33,29 --> 0:39:37,5
That takes a lot
of confidence.


1094
0:39:37,5 --> 0:39:39,99
A lot of people would
have went, who me?


1095
0:39:39,99 --> 0:39:44,333
You were like, I'm
Mr. Whiteface.

[GIGGLES]


1097
0:39:48,3 --> 0:39:52,19
I have a cousin that's very
sensitive about racism.


1098
0:39:52,19 --> 0:39:56,25
He called me one day because
he was quite upset that he


1099
0:39:56,25 --> 0:40:3,51
went to a tuba recital where he
was one of only three black


1100
0:40:3,51 --> 0:40:6,45
tuba players.


1101
0:40:6,45 --> 0:40:7,915
And he thought that
was racist.


1102
0:40:7,915 --> 0:40:11,24



1103
0:40:11,24 --> 0:40:14,42
And I wanted to agree.


1104
0:40:14,42 --> 0:40:21,28
But then I realized three black
tuba players is a lot of


1105
0:40:21,28 --> 0:40:23,653
fucking black tuba players.


1106
0:40:23,653 --> 0:40:34,1



1107
0:40:34,1 --> 0:40:40,81
If you see more than five blacks
tuba players, you're


1108
0:40:40,81 --> 0:40:42,88
watching an Outkast video.


1109
0:40:42,88 --> 0:40:49,83



1110
0:40:49,83 --> 0:40:53,2
But I, too, can be sensitive.


1111
0:40:53,2 --> 0:40:56,86
One day I was running across
the street because Slurpees


1112
0:40:56,86 --> 0:41:4,65
were on sale for what I thought
was a limited time.


1113
0:41:4,65 --> 0:41:15,95



1114
0:41:15,95 --> 0:41:17,361
You, guys, never been there?


1115
0:41:17,361 --> 0:41:23,29

Well, I got stuck
on this median.


1117
0:41:25,84 --> 0:41:27,99
This car drives by at me.


1118
0:41:27,99 --> 0:41:31,2
And a guy yells out
his window.


1119
0:41:31,2 --> 0:41:35,45
Use the crosswalk, N-word.


1120
0:41:35,45 --> 0:41:38,27

1122
0:41:39,52 --> 0:41:43,21



1123
0:41:43,21 --> 0:41:47,0
I thought that was
pretty racist.


1124
0:41:47,0 --> 0:41:51,17
But I also thought about
that situation.


1125
0:41:51,17 --> 0:41:56,59
And I realized, since he was
in a car, I probably just


1126
0:41:56,59 --> 0:41:57,88
didn't hear the whole
conversation.


1127
0:41:57,88 --> 0:42:7,12



1128
0:42:7,12 --> 0:42:12,17
What he was trying to say was,
use the crosswalk, nigger, I'm

Even if you didn't like that
joke, you have to admit that

was the most pleasant
use of the word

Thank you.

him grow up from a little

into madness by how he's

0:43:44,236 --> 0:43:47,52

When he was a toddler, he was
terrified of pinatas.

And it was my job to
vanquish that.

him several thousand dollars.

1:11:16,7 --> 1:11:19,24
And you can't get pissed at me
for that because, clearly,


1796
1:11:19,24 --> 1:11:22,9
that's just God's plan for me.


1797
1:11:22,9 --> 1:11:27,94
Good, you're a dumb dumdum,
a dumdum dumdum.


1798
1:11:27,94 --> 1:11:29,46
I guess, if you flip that
point over though, a


1799
1:11:29,46 --> 1:11:32,46
completely satanic comedian
would be equally as like


1800
1:11:32,46 --> 1:11:34,3
boring and stupid.


1801
1:11:34,3 --> 1:11:36,6
Like, you know, last week, I was
drinking the blood of the


1802
1:11:36,6 --> 1:11:40,25
nonbelievers, right?


1803
1:11:40,25 --> 1:11:41,23
And I would gargle.


1804
1:11:41,23 --> 1:11:44,206
And I gargled fire and spit it
on the kid in the playground.


1805
1:11:44,206 --> 1:11:45,4
[GARGLING]


1806
1:11:45,4 --> 1:11:50,54
So anyway, guys, you ever
tortured a doodlebug?


1807
1:11:50,54 --> 1:11:52,23
And they're like, there's
no innards to eat.


1808
1:11:52,23 --> 1:11:53,71
I'm a beast on the inside.


1809
1:11:53,71 --> 1:11:54,45
Mark of the beast!


1810
1:11:54,45 --> 1:11:56,21
6, 6, 6, 6, 6, 6.


1811
1:11:56,21 --> 1:11:59,7
So yesterday, I was carving a
pentagram into the rotting


1812
1:11:59,7 --> 1:12:4,3
flesh of a corpse I just
dug up and dilated.


1813
1:12:4,3 --> 1:12:6,99
But I started thinking, aren't
shovels expensive?


1814
1:12:6,99 --> 1:12:9,888
You forget, they're more
expensive than you think.


1815
1:12:9,888 --> 1:12:11,32
I went in there with
like a 10.


1816
1:12:11,32 --> 1:12:12,11
It was, like, 12.99.


1817
1:12:12,11 --> 1:12:13,3
I was like, what?


1818
1:12:13,3 --> 1:12:14,66
It's going to dig the
grave for me?


1819
1:12:14,66 --> 1:12:15,43
Know what I mean?


1820
1:12:15,43 --> 1:12:18,51
[BURBLING]


1821
1:12:18,51 --> 1:12:20,4
That's what I think
all satanists do.


1822
1:12:20,4 --> 1:12:24,805



1823
1:12:24,805 --> 1:12:27,78
Have you, guys, noticed
how fat I've gotten?


1824
1:12:27,78 --> 1:12:29,5
Yeah.


1825
1:12:29,5 --> 1:12:32,64
[FARTING SOUND]


1826
1:12:32,64 --> 1:12:33,67
I try and eat healthy.


1827
1:12:33,67 --> 1:12:36,2
I frequent a certain
sandwich-making franchised


1828
1:12:36,2 --> 1:12:39,53
establishment that legally, I
am no longer allowed to say


1829
1:12:39,53 --> 1:12:42,47
the name of into a microphone.


1830
1:12:42,47 --> 1:12:43,41
But I will give you a hint.


1831
1:12:43,41 --> 1:12:44,95
It's named after an underground
train system in


1832
1:12:44,95 --> 1:12:47,46
New York City.


1833
1:12:47,46 --> 1:12:48,61
See?


1834
1:12:48,61 --> 1:12:48,96
Bam!


1835
1:12:48,96 --> 1:12:50,35
Right on top of that.


1836
1:12:50,35 --> 1:12:52,67
I've been in front of some
audiences, like 45 minutes,


1837
1:12:52,67 --> 1:12:55,22
like underground train system,
New York City.


1838
1:12:55,22 --> 1:12:59,7
Starts with an S, ends with a Y.
They're like, uh, Quiznos.


1839
1:12:59,7 --> 1:13:1,52
That's not--


1840
1:13:1,52 --> 1:13:1,765
[MUTTERS]


1841
1:13:1,765 --> 1:13:3,97
fucking asshole.


1842
1:13:3,97 --> 1:13:6,26
I have the same complaints we
all have about that place.


1843
1:13:6,26 --> 1:13:7,29
The food isn't that good.


1844
1:13:7,29 --> 1:13:8,44
The price isn't that great.


1845
1:13:8,44 --> 1:13:11,84
Clearly, I'm not trying
to lose weight.


1846
1:13:11,84 --> 1:13:14,34
But I eat there because of the
culture, because the employees


1847
1:13:14,34 --> 1:13:15,12
of that place refer to


1848
1:13:15,12 --> 1:13:18,54
themselves as sandwich artists.


1849
1:13:18,54 --> 1:13:19,49
And I support the arts.


1850
1:13:19,49 --> 1:13:21,77
I believe in them.


1851
1:13:21,77 --> 1:13:24,7
I feel like when I go, I place
my order, the sandwich artist


1852
1:13:24,7 --> 1:13:28,5
hears it, becomes inspired, and
creatively interprets it


1853
1:13:28,5 --> 1:13:31,77
into sandwich art right
in front of my eyes.


1854
1:13:31,77 --> 1:13:34,53
I say, I would like a footlong
on garlic bread, please.


1855
1:13:34,53 --> 1:13:37,26
Ah, white bread, close enough,
let's just move on.


1856
1:13:37,26 --> 1:13:38,315
This is a journey.


1857
1:13:38,315 --> 1:13:40,68
Let's take it together.


1858
1:13:40,68 --> 1:13:43,42
I think I'll have some
turkey breast.


1859
1:13:43,42 --> 1:13:44,21
Four slices.


1860
1:13:44,21 --> 1:13:44,86
Well, you're right.


1861
1:13:44,86 --> 1:13:46,3
The meat is the worst part
of the sandwich.


1862
1:13:46,3 --> 1:13:49,2
Why do I want more of that?


1863
1:13:49,2 --> 1:13:52,21
Yes, I'll have some half-moon
shaped cheese, triangular


1864
1:13:52,21 --> 1:13:52,964
shaped cheese.


1865
1:13:52,964 --> 1:13:54,58
Ha-ha.


1866
1:13:54,58 --> 1:13:58,48
You, my friend, just taught me
to expect the unexpected.


1867
1:13:58,48 --> 1:14:0,4
Yes, I will have it toasted.


1868
1:14:0,4 --> 1:14:0,95
Ding!


1869
1:14:0,95 --> 1:14:3,438
Burnt.


1870
1:14:3,438 --> 1:14:5,68
Wow!


1871
1:14:5,68 --> 1:14:7,33
How's about some lettuce?


1872
1:14:7,33 --> 1:14:10,832
One pound of lettuce.


1873
1:14:10,832 --> 1:14:14,15
A pound of lettuce.


1874
1:14:14,15 --> 1:14:14,95
Beautiful.


1875
1:14:14,95 --> 1:14:17,11
May I have some sweet
peppers, please?


1876
1:14:17,11 --> 1:14:22,345
One, single, solitary sweet
pepper atop Mount Lettuce.


1877
1:14:22,345 --> 1:14:25,45



1878
1:14:25,45 --> 1:14:27,84
Wow, I see the symbolism
in that.


1879
1:14:27,84 --> 1:14:30,64
It's challenging.


1880
1:14:30,64 --> 1:14:31,89
We are all alone.


1881
1:14:31,89 --> 1:14:34,91



1882
1:14:34,91 --> 1:14:36,13
How's about some black olives?


1883
1:14:36,13 --> 1:14:39,405
Handful of black olives
scattered everywhere, except


1884
1:14:39,405 --> 1:14:41,732
the fucking sandwich itself.


1885
1:14:41,732 --> 1:14:44,86
[LAUGHS DIABOLICALLY]


1886
1:14:44,86 --> 1:14:47,51
Wow.


1887
1:14:47,51 --> 1:14:48,83
Those must represent
the things we


1888
1:14:48,83 --> 1:14:50,8
want but cannot have.


1889
1:14:50,8 --> 1:14:52,47



1890
1:14:52,47 --> 1:14:53,59
How's about some mayonnaise?


1891
1:14:53,59 --> 1:15:3,35
Pffft, pffft, pffft, pffft.


1892
1:15:3,35 --> 1:15:6,29



1893
1:15:6,29 --> 1:15:7,56
One ocean.


1894
1:15:7,56 --> 1:15:10,12
An ocean of mayonnaise.


1895
1:15:10,12 --> 1:15:17,63
Your sandwich is now
a submarine in a


1896
1:15:17,63 --> 1:15:19,57
mayonnaise-like ocean.


1897
1:15:19,57 --> 1:15:22,11
A may-ocean is what
I call that.


1898
1:15:22,11 --> 1:15:24,275
Oh, can I have some mustard?


1899
1:15:24,275 --> 1:15:25,54
Ah, no, more mayonnaise.


1900
1:15:25,54 --> 1:15:26,64
Pffft.


1901
1:15:26,64 --> 1:15:30,88
I will now cut this using this
knife I just cut five tuna


1902
1:15:30,88 --> 1:15:33,82
sandwiches with and
did not rinse.


1903
1:15:33,82 --> 1:15:35,81
I did not rinse this.


1904
1:15:35,81 --> 1:15:39,7
It is my artistic license
to use this


1905
1:15:39,7 --> 1:15:42,76
tuna-caked serrated blade.


1906
1:15:42,76 --> 1:15:43,48
Ah!


1907
1:15:43,48 --> 1:15:47,7
Who'd have-- huh, that's
beautiful!


1908
1:15:47,7 --> 1:15:50,2
Because that was a footlong,
but now one half is nine


1909
1:15:50,2 --> 1:15:51,74
inches, and the other
half's only three?


1910
1:15:51,74 --> 1:15:55,21



1911
1:15:55,21 --> 1:15:55,72
It's art.


1912
1:15:55,72 --> 1:15:57,65
It means something.


1913
1:15:57,65 --> 1:16:0,556
That nine inches represents
our expectations.


1914
1:16:0,556 --> 1:16:2,65
But that three inches represents
our reality.


1915
1:16:2,65 --> 1:16:5,405



1916
1:16:5,405 --> 1:16:13,8
[APPLAUSE]


1917
1:16:13,8 --> 1:16:15,54
SEAN PATTON: Thank you.


1918
1:16:15,54 --> 1:16:17,583
Do you, guys, know the
film "Men in Black"?


1919
1:16:17,583 --> 1:16:18,33
AUDIENCE: Yes.


1920
1:16:18,33 --> 1:16:19,985
SEAN PATTON: Remember the
neuralyzer, the thing they use


1921
1:16:19,985 --> 1:16:21,355
to erase people's memories?


1922
1:16:21,355 --> 1:16:25,98
My little brother, who is 14
years younger than me, my


1923
1:16:25,98 --> 1:16:27,94
other family members called
him "the mistake." I don't


1924
1:16:27,94 --> 1:16:29,52
think there was a mistake.


1925
1:16:29,52 --> 1:16:32,71
My parents knew exactly
what was going on.


1926
1:16:32,71 --> 1:16:34,23
My guess is they were
playing their annual


1927
1:16:34,23 --> 1:16:36,51
game, Truth or Dare.


1928
1:16:36,51 --> 1:16:38,77
And my mother dared my father
to knock her up again.


1929
1:16:38,77 --> 1:16:40,2
And he did because he's a man.


1930
1:16:40,2 --> 1:16:44,68



1931
1:16:44,68 --> 1:16:47,19
But 14 years is such
a gap and, like,


1932
1:16:47,19 --> 1:16:48,61
it's hard to relate.


1933
1:16:48,61 --> 1:16:50,11
When I was 18, he was 4.


1934
1:16:50,11 --> 1:16:52,1
It's hard to be a brother.


1935
1:16:52,1 --> 1:16:54,22
I tried, you know, dude, hey,
guess what I did yesterday?


1936
1:16:54,22 --> 1:16:57,62
I fingered Trish Howell
in the woods.


1937
1:16:57,62 --> 1:16:59,5
What did you do?


1938
1:16:59,5 --> 1:17:1,37
Jumped in the pool
three times?


1939
1:17:1,37 --> 1:17:2,4
Wow, no floaties?


1940
1:17:2,4 --> 1:17:6,59
Like, there's no relating going
on with that age gap.


1941
1:17:6,59 --> 1:17:8,7
The only thing we had was his
favorite movie was "Men in


1942
1:17:8,7 --> 1:17:9,73
Black" when he was four.


1943
1:17:9,73 --> 1:17:12,76
He loved it so much, he made
his own toy neuralyzer.


1944
1:17:12,76 --> 1:17:14,84
He just took a paper towel tube,
stuffed some shit in


1945
1:17:14,84 --> 1:17:17,21
there, drew some buttons on it,
and would make a little


1946
1:17:17,21 --> 1:17:18,355
"beeyou" sound.


1947
1:17:18,355 --> 1:17:21,8
And his favorite thing in the
world was to neuralize me, his


1948
1:17:21,8 --> 1:17:24,12
big brother, and give
me a new identity.


1949
1:17:24,12 --> 1:17:25,4
So I just hear him go, beeyou!


1950
1:17:25,4 --> 1:17:26,48
And I'm like, oh, who am I?


1951
1:17:26,48 --> 1:17:27,79
And he'd be, like, you're
a butt-head.


1952
1:17:27,79 --> 1:17:32,84
And then run away, laughing
his little heart out.


1953
1:17:32,84 --> 1:17:35,47
Or I'd wake up for school, and
he'd be standing there.


1954
1:17:35,47 --> 1:17:36,36
Beeyou!


1955
1:17:36,36 --> 1:17:36,97
Who am I?


1956
1:17:36,97 --> 1:17:39,16
You're a fart-face.


1957
1:17:39,16 --> 1:17:41,8
Always made me a butt-head
or a fart-face.


1958
1:17:41,8 --> 1:17:43,72
Once, I'm in you butt-head,
fart-face.


1959
1:17:43,72 --> 1:17:45,5
Once, he made me Howard Hughes,


1960
1:17:45,5 --> 1:17:47,2
which caught me off-guard.


1961
1:17:47,2 --> 1:17:50,296
How do you know who
Howard Hughes is?


1962
1:17:50,296 --> 1:17:50,74
Beeyou!


1963
1:17:50,74 --> 1:17:51,29
Howard Hughes!


1964
1:17:51,29 --> 1:17:52,645
And he ran off.


1965
1:17:52,645 --> 1:17:53,87
I was also Asian.


1966
1:17:53,87 --> 1:17:54,686
I was Asian.


1967
1:17:54,686 --> 1:17:57,98
Apparently that was the Asian
year of his life.


1968
1:17:57,98 --> 1:17:59,31
Ran off to go apply
to Stanford.


1969
1:17:59,31 --> 1:18:3,4



1970
1:18:3,4 --> 1:18:6,69
But he was always working on
that thing, add new buttons,


1971
1:18:6,69 --> 1:18:8,81
add little pieces to it,
draw new buttons on it.


1972
1:18:8,81 --> 1:18:9,7
He was really proud of it.


1973
1:18:9,7 --> 1:18:12,84
I remember one day having that
standard teenager breakdown in


1974
1:18:12,84 --> 1:18:13,6
my parents' house.


1975
1:18:13,6 --> 1:18:16,93
It's like, no one understands me
or my pain growing up in an


1976
1:18:16,93 --> 1:18:20,5
upper middle-class suburb where
I'm safe in a supportive


1977
1:18:20,5 --> 1:18:22,14
environment, and my family
cares about me.


1978
1:18:22,14 --> 1:18:25,28
That's fucking bullshit.


1979
1:18:25,28 --> 1:18:27,65
And I tell my mom, I want
to be a performer.


1980
1:18:27,65 --> 1:18:29,27
She's like, well, do
good and apply to a


1981
1:18:29,27 --> 1:18:30,12
liberal arts college.


1982
1:18:30,12 --> 1:18:31,45
Fuck you, bitch.


1983
1:18:31,45 --> 1:18:32,285
You don't know me.


1984
1:18:32,285 --> 1:18:33,65
You don't know me.


1985
1:18:33,65 --> 1:18:36,38



1986
1:18:36,38 --> 1:18:38,91
And the whole time, he's just
running along trying to


1987
1:18:38,91 --> 1:18:41,28
neuralize me.


1988
1:18:41,28 --> 1:18:43,47
And he'd added like a
tinfoil piece to it,


1989
1:18:43,47 --> 1:18:45,3
like another section.


1990
1:18:45,3 --> 1:18:46,56
He was real proud of
this neuralyzer.


1991
1:18:46,56 --> 1:18:47,565
He'd been working on it.


1992
1:18:47,565 --> 1:18:48,23
And he's just, beeyou!


1993
1:18:48,23 --> 1:18:48,605
Beeyou!


1994
1:18:48,605 --> 1:18:48,98
Beeyou!


1995
1:18:48,98 --> 1:18:51,12
And I'm annoyed and
ignoring him.


1996
1:18:51,12 --> 1:18:53,26
And finally, I just
go, goddammit!


1997
1:18:53,26 --> 1:18:54,38
Stop it!


1998
1:18:54,38 --> 1:18:55,7
Stop it!


1999
1:18:55,7 --> 1:18:57,632
And I'd never yelled
at him before.


2000
1:18:57,632 --> 1:18:58,9
He's a four-year-old.


2001
1:18:58,9 --> 1:19:2,448
And he was just like shocked.


2002
1:19:2,448 --> 1:19:5,83
And like a little tear, just
like a single tear ran down


2003
1:19:5,83 --> 1:19:7,53
his four-year-old cheek.


2004
1:19:7,53 --> 1:19:10,3
And then just to destroy me for
the rest of my life, he


2005
1:19:10,3 --> 1:19:11,985
turned that neuralyzer
on himself.


2006
1:19:11,985 --> 1:19:17,74



2007
1:19:17,74 --> 1:19:21,115
Maybe you hit your younger
brother, maybe you framed him


2008
1:19:21,115 --> 1:19:26,74
for murder; neither of those are
nearly as bad as yelling


2009
1:19:26,74 --> 1:19:28,993
at him and make him
go, beeyou.


2010
1:19:28,993 --> 1:19:32,22



2011
1:19:32,22 --> 1:19:34,27
He didn't even give himself
a new identity.


2012
1:19:34,27 --> 1:19:37,1



2013
1:19:37,1 --> 1:19:39,79
I carried that guilt
for years.


2014
1:19:39,79 --> 1:19:41,28
I'm such a terrible brother.


2015
1:19:41,28 --> 1:19:44,19
10 years later at a family
Christmas party, I just moved


2016
1:19:44,19 --> 1:19:47,89
to New York, I was back home in
New Orleans for Christmas.


2017
1:19:47,89 --> 1:19:48,91
I'm drunk.


2018
1:19:48,91 --> 1:19:50,98
He's a teenager at this point.


2019
1:19:50,98 --> 1:19:52,42
And he's like, what's
New York like?


2020
1:19:52,42 --> 1:19:53,28
Can I come visit you some day?


2021
1:19:53,28 --> 1:19:54,65
And my reaction was, [SOBS]


2022
1:19:54,65 --> 1:19:56,4
I'm so, I'm so sorry.


2023
1:19:56,4 --> 1:19:58,4
I really--


2024
1:19:58,4 --> 1:19:59,88
I'm sorry I yelled.


2025
1:19:59,88 --> 1:20:1,78
I should have just let
you neuralize me.


2026
1:20:1,78 --> 1:20:4,51
I'm such a piece of shit.


2027
1:20:4,51 --> 1:20:6,735
I'm so sorry I yelled at you.


2028
1:20:6,735 --> 1:20:10,2
I'm so sorry that
I yelled at you.


2029
1:20:10,2 --> 1:20:12,83
And he just calmly goes, what?


2030
1:20:12,83 --> 1:20:14,8
I don't remember that.


2031
1:20:14,8 --> 1:20:17,355



2032
1:20:17,355 --> 1:20:19,606
That fucking thing worked!


2033
1:20:19,606 --> 1:20:21,1
It worked, man.


2034
1:20:21,1 --> 1:20:24,88
He is a genius.


2035
1:20:24,88 --> 1:20:26,8
Thank you very much.

MALE SPEAKER: Come
on, seriously?


2057
1:21:12,835 --> 1:21:14,28
MALE SPEAKER: The All-Nighter
is an annual event.


2058
1:21:14,28 --> 1:21:15,62
We've been doing it
five years now.


2059
1:21:15,62 --> 1:21:17,24
JAKE HURWITZ: It's a night where
we all stay up and we


2060
1:21:17,24 --> 1:21:20,4
make as many videos as we
possibly can for you, guys.


2061
1:21:20,4 --> 1:21:22,3
MALE SPEAKER: So if you're up
studying all night for finals


2062
1:21:22,3 --> 1:21:24,6
or you're working the night
shift or you just need a break


2063
1:21:24,6 --> 1:21:25,75
from all that porn--


2064
1:21:25,75 --> 1:21:27,87
MALE SPEAKER: Basically, it's
sort of a personal challenge


2065
1:21:27,87 --> 1:21:31,6
to us to see how long it takes
for us to completely lose


2066
1:21:31,6 --> 1:21:31,95
touch with reality.


2067
1:21:31,95 --> 1:21:33,58
MALE SPEAKER: We do
a live stream.


2068
1:21:33,58 --> 1:21:35,68
AMIR BLUMENFELD: We're like the
Lance Armstrong of comedy,


2069
1:21:35,68 --> 1:21:38,36
where we're just enduring,
enduring, enduring, making


2070
1:21:38,36 --> 1:21:39,34
things happen.


2071
1:21:39,34 --> 1:21:41,49
But at the end of the day,
nobody respects us.


2072
1:21:41,49 --> 1:21:42,82
MALE SPEAKER: One thing that's
great about the All-Nighter.


2073
1:21:42,82 --> 1:21:44,53
is that we get guests
to come in.

Kids U'Know."

Pete Holmes.


2078
1:21:48,946 --> 1:21:52,32
MALE SPEAKER: Jon Gabrus has
been a favorite guest of mine


2079
1:21:52,32 --> 1:21:55,17
always because I think every
year that goes by, he's wore


2080
1:21:55,17 --> 1:21:57,11
less and less clothing.


2081
1:21:57,11 --> 1:21:59,7
JAKE HURWITZ: I think our
favorite guest is you.


2082
1:21:59,7 --> 1:22:0,97
Just like, you and your--


2083
1:22:0,97 --> 1:22:2,253
I'm probably yours, just
like you love--

would say Ben Schwartz.

MALE SPEAKER: We ask
them to join us.


2086
1:22:5,94 --> 1:22:9,56
And then they have the
privilege, the honor of coming


2087
1:22:9,56 --> 1:22:13,25
to work at 4:30 in the morning
to shoot a two-minute sketch


2088
1:22:13,25 --> 1:22:15,9
where they get spaghetti
dumped on their face.


2089
1:22:15,9 --> 1:22:15,97

upload a virus

how long it will go?


2099
1:22:28,75 --> 1:22:31,16
Maybe all night, maybe even
longer than that.
