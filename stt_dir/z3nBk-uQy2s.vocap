###0 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###10 DAVID CHOE: Quick recap.
###11 We got picked up in a van, like a delivery maintenance
###16 van with a older white lady, someone that looked like her
###21 son or her boyfriend that was about to go in the Army, and a
###25 shady Mexican guy in the back seat.
###27 We pulled over.
###28 She got into a truck--
###29 like, a 18 wheeler truck and drove away.
###32 Her son went into Walmart.
###33 And then Oncho, the guy in the back, got in the front,
###38 threatened our cameramen to turn the camera off or else.
###41 And then we didn't talk that much.
###44 But we found out, A, he has no sense of direction,
###48 which he's proud of.
###49 But he's also a delivery man.
###51 So that sort of doesn't go together.
###53 And two, he lives in Nevada.
###55 But his parole is in Arizona, which is where we are now,
###59 standing in front of the American flag, the USA.
###66 MALE SPEAKER: One, two, three, go.
###67 
###88 DAVID CHOE: This is Lars.
###89 This is a '56--
###92 LARS: Pontiac.
###93 DAVID CHOE: Pontiac.
###94 He gave us a ride into Flagstaff today.
###98 Why did you give us a ride?
###100 LARS: Oh, you look like the friendly folk.
###102 DAVID CHOE: And then were you scared at any
###103 point in the ride?
###104 LARS: Nope.
###105 DAVID CHOE: Even when we were doing funny stuff?
###108 LARS: Nope.
###109 DAVID CHOE: OK.
###110 All right.
###111 I guess he wasn't scared.
###112 And I guess he was nice enough to give us a ride.
###114 Thank you.
###115 We appreciate it.
###116 LARS: You're welcome.
###117 
###123 DAVID CHOE: This is day four.
###124 We're at Flagstaff, Arizona.
###125 We got into some small town in Arizona last night.
###129 And it was dark already.
###131 So we had a really tough time getting out.
###133 We were standing out there for quite a bit.
###135 We made a sign.
###136 We couldn't find too much cardboard.
###139 Had no luck with our Flagstaff sign.
###142 And on offense to our gay viewers.
###146 But the second I made this adjustment, we got picked up
###155 immediately in about 30 seconds.
###158 I don't think the last one was gay.
###160 Yeah.
###160 I don't think he even noticed the sign.
###162 But just one of those things that went that way.
###165 So this sign's pretty useless now.
###167 We're in Flagstaff now, where I guess a lot of
###170 hippies live here.
###172 And the locals here don't really like them.
###175 They call them treehuggers.
###178 I don't know if we're going to catch a train out
###183 or hop out of here.
###186 Yesterday was a little tough.
###190 You see those dudes over there by the porta potty by the
###194 train tracks.
###195 So I think we're going to go talk to them.
###197 Hi.
###198 So it looks like we have kindred spirits along the side
###203 of the road here.
###204 We got fellow travelers.
###205 You guys--
###207 TOBY: We're from Canada.
###208 DAVID CHOE: They're Canadians.
###209 TOBY: Montreal.
###210 [INAUDIBLE]
###210 ROXANE: We came from Montreal.
###212 DAVID CHOE: Did you guys hitchhike
###213 all over Canada before?
###213 ROXANE: No.
###214 TOBY: I did.
###214 DAVID CHOE: You did.
###215 TOBY: Not all over.
###216 But I did few province.
###217 DAVID CHOE: And now that you're hitchhiking with a
###218 woman, do you get rides faster?
###221 TOBY: Yeah, I think so.
###223 ROXANE: Obviously.
###225 Oh, yeah.
###226 But everything's going pretty well.
###228 TOBY: And you know what that was crazy?
###230 Because we've been in a desert.
###231 And we found people.
###232 And they gave food to us and place to stay for free.
###237 And they gave to us money.
###239 And they had food and everything.
###241 DAVID CHOE: Wow.
###241 They were nice?
###242 ROXANE: Oh, yeah.
###243 TOBY: They were all nice.
###244 I was scared to be hitchhiking in USA.
###246 Because it's not our country.
###247 ROXANE: Yeah.
###247 TOBY: And I was like maybe we will get problem.
###250 But you know, life is good.
###251 And there is an angel somewhere in the sky for us.
###254 ROXANE: Oh, yeah.
###255 Yeah.
###255 He helps us.
###256 TOBY: Yeah.
###257 DAVID CHOE: That's the road angel.
###258 ROXANE: Yeah.
###259 DAVID CHOE: How long has it been since you left?
###261 TOBY: Pardon?
###262 DAVID CHOE: How long has it been since you left your home?
###264 ROXANE: One year.
###264 TOBY: [INAUDIBLE]
###264 Yeah, I left before July.
###266 DAVID CHOE: What's the plan?
###268 Where are you guys going?
###269 How far and long are you going?
###270 ROXANE: We don't know.
###270 TOBY: We don't know.
###270 We have to get to Montreal.
###271 ROXANE: Yeah.
###271 TOBY: And we don't have a lot of money.
###272 So it should--
###273 ROXANE: I have 35 bucks til there.
###274 DAVID CHOE: Oh, wow.
###276 TOBY: We just hope that we've going to get a ride soon and
###279 we're going to get home soon.
###281 And we're proud of what we got here.
###284 ROXANE: Oh, yeah.
###285 Everybody is so nice.
###286 TOBY: Thank you for everything.
###286 DAVID CHOE: Road warriors.
###287 ROXANE: That was a pleasure.
###288 DAVID CHOE: Fellow kindred spirits.
###289 
###293 DAVID CHOE: We're trying to catch a ride off the 40 East
###295 to go to Albuquerque.
###298 I saw this spot also.
###299 And I thought this would be a good spot to hitch out of.
###302 And then I saw you hat.
###303 And I said oh, there's someone else there too.
###305 And you've been here since--
###306 DONALD: Since about eight o'clock this morning.
###308 I got up at daylight.
###310 And then I had enough money to get me a cup of coffee.
###312 Got a cup of coffee.
###313 And I walked up here.
###314 I've been here since then.
###315 DAVID CHOE: If you haven't gotten a right in like eight
###319 hours, you move to a different spot and you just--
###322 DONALD: There's no place else to move to.
###323 DAVID CHOE: All right.
###323 DONALD: Unless you walk a long ways.
###325 But that backpack--
###326 I don't want to walk a long ways.
###327 It's heavy.
###328 DAVID CHOE: What's your story then?
###330 Where are you trying to get to?
###331 Where are you coming from?
###331 DONALD: I'm trying to get to Al Paso.
###332 DAVID CHOE: Is there a reason why you're
###333 trying to get there?
###334 DONALD: I stay there every winter.
###336 I'm homeless.
###337 So I stay there during the winter.
###338 Because the winter's mild there.
###339 DAVID CHOE: Right.
###340 So you migrate towards the temperatures.
###342 DONALD: Yeah.
###344 DAVID CHOE: And the people that give you rides-- they're
###346 nice, they're mean, they're weird?
###346 DONALD: Yeah.
###347 No.
###347 I get a few weird ones.
###348 But most of them's all nice.
###349 I've had no problems.
###350 DAVID CHOE: Can you tell us one of the weird ones?
###352 DONALD: Oh, there's gays trying to pick you up.
###356 Or some of them act like they're a little drunk.
###358 They're just weird acting.
###359 DAVID CHOE: All right.
###360 Well, would you rather us hitchhike behind you or in
###362 front of you.
###363 DONALD: Yeah, you can go ahead.
###364 Actually, if you want to go up there, you can.
###365 DAVID CHOE: Well, I mean, if we get picked up before you,
###366 then I'll for sure tell them to pick you up also, you know?
###371 So out of respect, we're letting grandpa take the prime
###374 real estate hitchhiking spot.
###375 We were sort of assholes and we're trying to cut them off
###378 at the pass and try to get a ride earlier.
###381 But if we get a ride, of course, he'll give
###382 grandpa a ride too.
###383 It looks like he just almost got a ride.
###385 But then I guess they weren't going where he's going.
###387 So he's back out over there.
###389 But I like our anywhere but here sign.
###391 Because Flagstaff is--
###393 it's no good here.
###394 It's bad mojo.
###395 
###404 We're trying to catch a ride off the 40 East to go into
###407 Albuquerque.
###409 Because Flagstaff is--
###411 it's no good here.
###413 It's bad mojo.
###417 Thanks for picking us up.
###418 I appreciate it.
###419 WAYLON: Yeah, yeah.
###419 No problem at all.
###420 [INAUDIBLE]
###421 DAVID CHOE: Jump on in.
###421 I told you we'd get--
###422 DONALD: Could you throw this back there for me?
###422 DAVID CHOE: OK, yeah.
###423 We'll throw it back there.
###425 WAYLON: All right.
###426 One big happy family.
###428 What's up?
###429 DAVID CHOE: It's awesome.
###429 WAYLON: Look at this.
###431 Wow, boy.
###432 I dropped off one guy in town here in Flag.
###435 Just picked up four more.
###436 How about it?
###437 DAVID CHOE: That's awesome.
###437 WAYLON: So what do you guys got going on, you know?
###439 DAVID CHOE: We're just trying to get as far as we
###441 can get, you know.
###442 WAYLON: Well I'm going to make it as far as Atlanta.
###445 DAVID CHOE: Are you really?
###446 WAYLON: Yeah.
###447 So you guys are pretty styling as far as rides go if you guys
###451 are into it?
###452 DAVID CHOE: Well that's awesome.
###454 But we're trying to get as many
###457 different rides as possible.
###459 WAYLON: Really?
###459 That's sick.
###460 So how far are guys going to rip with me then?
###462 Until I get boring or what?
###463 DAVID CHOE: No, no, no.
###466 It's not that.
###466 We just want to stop in every state.
###468 WAYLON: You guys are hitching masters.
###471 Check you guys out.
###472 DAVID CHOE: Can you tell us a little bit like
###473 what your story is?
###474 Like have you hitchhiked before?
###476 Obviously you've picked up hitchhikers.
###478 WAYLON: Oh, yeah, yeah.
###479 Yeah, I've hitched quite a bit, man Yeah, on the East
###482 coast and on the West coast.
###484 It's not so bad on the West coast.
###487 But I think they made a lot of movies back in the late '80s
###490 about hitchhikers killing people.
###491 DAVID CHOE: Right.
###492 WAYLON: So everybody's scared to death, not to mention that
###495 the media's got everybody so scared shitless of each
###497 other's shadows these days that nobody wants to pick up
###501 anybody for jack.
###502 DAVID CHOE: That's the same feeling I get is just sometime
###504 during the '80s, like two or three people got killed.
###506 But people forget that, like, everyone used to hitchhike and
###509 everyone used to give rides.
###510 And it was no problem.
###510 WAYLON: Yeah.
###511 DAVID CHOE: And then they blow something out of proportion.
###514 And I've hitchhiked for years.
###515 And I've never really had any major--
###517 you get picked up by weirdos.
###518 But nothing--
###519 you know.
###520 If you're out of luck and you need a ride,
###522 it's nice, you know.
###524 HARRY KIM: This is Donald.
###525 And he's been telling me about how for the last four years
###528 he's been homeless.
###529 So he's kind of become like a US traveler.
###531 DONALD: The thing about homeless, you know--
###533 there's a lot of you get broke, and
###535 you get a hard time.
###536 But life's full of hard times anyhow.
###537 You've got go through bad.
###539 You have good times, all that.
###541 But in a way, I'm free.
###544 Because I don't have to worry about nothing really, just
###547 surviving, on being alive.
###550 DAVID CHOE: Where's home base for you?
###552 WAYLON: Right here, my man.
###553 DAVID CHOE: Oh, you're from--
###553 WAYLON: You're right.
###555 DAVID CHOE: You're from Flagstaff?
###556 WAYLON: No.
###556 I'm from my Dolphin right here.
###559 I'm from the RV.
###560 DAVID CHOE: Oh, this is is?
###561 WAYLON: Yeah, man.
###561 Yeah.
###563 DAVID CHOE: I think everyone that works an office job
###566 secretly desires exactly what you're doing, like fucking
###571 jump in your car.
###572 Get your dog.
###572 WAYLON: Yeah.
###573 DAVID CHOE: Live from place to place.
###575 Where you lay your head is home, just go.
###576 Wherever you go, new adventures, new things.
###579 WAYLON: You know, everybody wants a van.
###581 But there's fewer and fewer people who are willing to do
###584 what it takes or to succeed at their dream and live a
###588 fulfilled life, man.
###590 So I'm just trying to take advantage of my life is all--
###592 DAVID CHOE: Right.
###593 WAYLON: Not take it for granted and appreciate this
###595 beautiful gift we call life.
###597 DAVID CHOE: Right.
###598 WAYLON: So other than that, my man, that's about it.
###600 I worked for a while, saved up some money.
###601 And I'm just doing my thing.
###605 DAVID CHOE: Was it a girl?
###606 WAYLON: Just kind of creating my scene.
###607 What's that?
###608 DAVID CHOE: Was it a girl?
###609 WAYLON: Oh, this is the only girl for me
###610 right here, this Angus.
###611 
###615 DAVID CHOE: This guy is like basically
###616 the hitchhiking paradise.
###618 He picks up everyone.
###620 He's living in the present.
###622 Basically, our entire trip can end right here.
###625 He basically offered us a ride to the
###626 other side of the country.
###627 So we'll see if we do that.
###629 We have another guy down here that we're going to pick up.
###632 So it's still a sausage fest right now.
###634 But we'll see how it goes.
###636 Is he holding a dog?
###638 HARRY KIM: I'm Harry.
###639 DAVID CHOE: David
###640 MALE SPEAKER: Nice to meet you.
###641 Where are you from?
###642 Where are you headed?
###643 DAVID CHOE: Greenbay.
###643 MALE SPEAKER: Greenbay?
###644 DAVID CHOE: Yeah.
###645 WAYLON: So who's driving, y'all?
###646 MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]
###647 WAYLON: Hey, brother.
###648 DAVID CHOE: Do you know how to drive stick?
###649 MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.
###650 DAVID CHOE: Do you want to drive?
###651 MALE SPEAKER: Sure.
###652 DAVID CHOE: OK, cool.
###653 WAYLON: Ah, poor boys.
###654 Wake me up in Saint Louis.
###656 
###674 DAVID CHOE: Calling all lost souls seems to be the
###677 theme of this one.
###679 We're going to ride on the Dolphin.
###680 It's like the Noah's Arc of hitchhikers.
###684 We picked up two guys and two dogs also.
###689 So total, there's five hitchhikers on there and one
###692 awesome guy named Waylon, kindred spirits.
###695 Just picked us up.
###696 Picks up all hitchhikers.
###697 He doesn't care if they're carrying a trash bag full of
###700 french fries or smell like shit.
###702 He'll pick anywhere up.
###704 And weed seems to be the common
###706 theme of all the travelers.
###710 Grandpa here has a huge weed tattoo on his arm.
###712 The other fellow--
###713 I forgot his name--
###714 was stranded on the street.
###715 Because he had a weed deal with his cousin that went bad.
###718 So his cousin had a hissy fit and then threw him out.
###721 And then Waylon, who actually enjoys weed, but then doesn't
###724 smoke it anymore.
###725 He's got his own spiritual dilemma going on right now.
###728 And all around, good guys.
###730 
###734 So we're 60 miles outside of Albuquerque and our longest
###737 ride so far.
###739 In four days, we've gone through
###740 California, Nevada, Arizona.
###744 And now we're in New Mexico, in a place called Moriarty.
###747 And it was funny.
###748 Because the guy that picked us up and one of the other guys
###750 that we picked up--
###751 we're all of 30.
###753 Those two guys still--
###755 they're wandering souls.
###757 But they still live at home with their parents.
###760 And besides weed and drywalling, they
###764 all had funny tattoos.
###766 Great guys though, really cool guys.
###768 It's about midnight right now.
###770 And we're at the truck stop.
###771 So we'll see what this own has to offer.
###775 Thumbs up.
###776 
###782 All right.
###782 This is David Choe.
###782 And this is Thumbs Up.
###784 This is day five on our journey.
###787 We are still in New Mexico.
###790 Yesterday we rode for 12 hours.
###792 We got a ride with a nice fellow named Waylon Powers.
###795 And then we picked up grandpa.
###797 And then we also picked up--
###798 I can't remember his name.
###799 Strong, silent type, looked like Paul Newman.
###802 Paul Newman didn't say much for most of the ride unless it
###805 had anything to do with
###805 construction work or dry walling.
###807 And then all of a sudden out of nowhere comes out with, I
###811 think I tend to fall in love really easily if the pussy's
###814 really good.
###815 Where Waylon comes in with, on, man.
###819 It's just a box, man.
###820 It's just a box.
###822 You got to deny yourself the box, man.
###825 Deny yourself the weed, the beer, and the pussy.
###828 And that's how you empower yourself.
###831 I guess we all had that in common is that we all tend to
###834 fall in love with the box, fall in love with the pussy if
###836 it's really good.
###837 I guess I don't know if that's love or not.
###839 But that was that.
###841 So we're going to try to get to Texas today.
###843 
###846 So, hi.
###848 We're in the town of Moriarty.
###851 And this is in--
###852 VANESSA: New Mexico.
###853 BUBBA: New Mexico.
###853 DAVID CHOE: New Mexico.
###854 Everyone introduce yourselves.
###857 BUBBA: I'm Bubba.
###858 DAVID CHOE: That's Bubba.
###859 VANESSA: I'm Vanessa.
###860 DAVID CHOE: Vanessa.
###861 SUSIE: I'm Susie.
###863 CHRIS: I'm Chris
###864 PUMPKIN: Pumpkin.
###865 AMANDA: Amanda.
###867 DAVID CHOE: So you guys want to tell us a little bit about
###868 this town and what goes on here?
###870 BUBBA: It's very small.
###871 There's a lot of drinking.
###872 DAVID CHOE: A lot of drinking.
###873 Oh, everyone's waiting for the liquor
###875 store to open on Sunday.
###875 CHRIS: Yeah.
###876 BUBBA: Yeah.
###877 How many minutes?
###878 Those open.
###879 SUSIE: The average age in Moriarty to start
###880 drinking is like six.
###882 DAVID CHOE: What's the population here?
###884 SUSIE: No, about 2,200 right now.
###887 DAVID CHOE: All right.
###887 Were you guys all born and raised in this town?
###890 PUMPKIN: Fuck, no.
###891 AMANDA: No.
###892 PUMPKIN: You're fucking funny.
###893 DAVID CHOE: Texas?
###896 SUSIE: Texas, yeah, born and bred.
###898 DAVID CHOE: Which city?
###899 SUSIE: These two were born in Albuquerque.
###901 He was born in Florida.
###903 I don't know where he was born at.
###904 PUMPKIN: I was born in hell.
###907 SUSIE: No.
###908 DAVID CHOE: So you guys seem to come from various parts of
###910 purgatory, hell, and other parts of the South.
###913 What brought you guys to--
###916 SUSIE: These are my two daughters and my two
###917 son-in-laws.
###917 DAVID CHOE: Oh.
###919 SUSIE: And my husband.
###921 DAVID CHOE: And so why did you guys pick this town?
###922 SUSIE: Because we hate Albuquerque.
###923 AMANDA: New Mexico sucks.
###925 Because Texas is better.
###926 BUBBA: Texas is better, man.
###927 DAVID CHOE: God bless Texas.
###928 SUSIE: This is what one is.
###928 We were out here.
###929 We were looking for land.
###930 And we were looking in Berlin and all that stuff, and
###932 looking for land out here.
###932 We came out here on his Harley, no less, huh?
###935 And a 10-year-old boy held the door open for me and stood
###938 there and said yes, ma'am, no, ma'am.
###940 And I was like well, this is where we're moving.
###942 DAVID CHOE: Just like that.
###943 SUSIE: Just like that.
###944 DAVID CHOE: So you guys all drink together as a family.
###946 AMANDA: I don't know
###946 PUMPKIN: I do.
###946 I've never touched a drop of alcohol in my life.
###949 SUSIE: The girls can't drink.
###950 Because they're both expecting.
###952 DAVID CHOE: Are you really?
###952 BUBBA: Yeah.
###953 DAVID CHOE: Oh, wow.
###953 Congratulations.
###955 PUMPKIN: They call me Pumpkin for one reason.
###957 Because I was born in McCaws's pumpkin patch, lost it at
###959 McCale's motherfucking farm.
###961 This is why they call me Pumpkin.
###963 Because I roam with the wicked shit, here and everybody else,
###967 feeling nothing but that acid trip.
###969 Don't give a fuck.
###969 Water fall down, all around.

###1003 You guys start early.
###1004 BUBBA: Yep.
###1005 CHRIS: Why not?
###1006 VANESSA: [INAUDIBLE] early.
###1008 BUBBA: No.
###1008 You go to El Paso.
###1009 They start at like three in the morning.
###1011 DAVID CHOE: Wait.
###1011 So you guys are smashed by, like, two in the afternoon.
###1015 SUSIE: There's only two of us that get smashed--
###1016 him and him.
###1017 DAVID CHOE: And none of this leads to violence.
###1019 VANESSA: Nope.
###1019 SUSIE: No.
###1021 PUMPKIN: No.

###1021 BUBBA: And he's not here yet.
###1023 PUMPKIN: I do got a lot of criminal charges.
###1025 DAVID CHOE: But no felonies.
###1026 PUMPKIN: No felonies.
###1027 DAVID CHOE: That's good.
###1028 PUMPKIN: Just a lot of criminal charges.
###1029 That's all.
###1030 All misdemeanors, all misdemeanors.
###1032 DAVID CHOE: Well, it was nice meeting you all.
###1033 CHRIS: Same here.
###1034 
###1040 DAVID CHOE: We're at a freeway underpass right now.
###1042 We're trying to hop out, hopefully get into a different
###1045 state by today.
###1047 We have some really classic graffiti here that I'm going
###1051 to try to decipher for you.
###1054 It doesn't get more perfect than this.
###1056 First we have the pentagram with the six, six, six, with a
###1060 pitchfork, a swastika, and upside down cross.
###1062 Here we have an abstract cow, and then of course Metallica,
###1069 another swastika--
###1070 awesome job--
###1073 hammer, white power, and the classic graffiti S that
###1076 everyone draws when they're in high school.
###1079 And I don't know if this is the exactly how it happened.
###1081 But this is how I imagine it happened in my mind.
###1084 I'm guessing white power, white trash, gutter punk
###1087 couple was up here getting drunk, spray painting.
###1091 And then those past two columns, the male, who is
###1094 usually more aggressive, was painting the swastikas and the
###1096 six, six, six.
###1097 And his girlfriend was like I took one of the cans and came
###1100 over here and did the Pac Man ghosts.
###1103 So here's the Pac Man ghosts, which are much more friendlier
###1106 and more light-hearted.
###1108 Oh my goodness.
###1109 Look at what I found.
###1112 I thought it couldn't get better than this.
###1113 A China man the only other color--
###1119 I mean, so for all the grafiti's been in black, but
###1121 they broke out the metallics for this one.
###1123 It's a buck tooth China man with a coolie cap on.
###1127 And someone crossed him out, saying no China man, with
###1131 silver paint.
###1132 And right there we have, of course, the
###1136 classic human shit.
###1137 
###1162 We're having a really tough time catching out of
###1164 this part of town.
###1165 So we're breaking out the instruments, who, Hasinto, our
###1169 cameraman, has been carrying for us this whole time.
###1173 We're going to play our golden medley, the one that usually
###1175 gets us picked up, which is a fusion of Guns n' Roses, Mr.
###1180 Brownstone, the Police's, Every Breath You Take, and
###1184 whatever Led Zeppelin songs Harry decides
###1187 moves him at the moment.
###1188 
###1191 HARRY KIM: [SINGING]
###1191 Fuck New Mexico.
###1192 Texas is better.
###1197 Texas is better.
###1201 Fuck New Mexico.
###1202 
###1216 DAVID CHOE: We rocked Moriarty, New Mexico.
###1218 We rocked California.
###1219 We rocked Nevada.
###1221 Is Texas going to rock us or will we rock Texas?
###1224 Find out in Thumbs Up, the next issue.
###1226 
###1231 We're in New Mexico still.
###1233 New Mexico, Texas.
###1234 A lot of fucking cows.
###1236 We're getting hungry.
###1237 We're going to try to catch one, try to jump on one.
###1239 
###1247 God bless John Wayne.
###1249 
###1265 So as the day comes to a close, many lessons to learn.
###1269 A, as humans, we can't even run as fast
###1273 as chickens or cows.
###1276 We're in a beautiful town of Tucumcari, New Mexico.
###1279 We were in Moriarty, New Mexico, earlier today, where
###1283 we met an amazing beautiful family.
###1286 Well, I mean they were something really special.
###1288 They were beautiful human beings.
###1290 We learned lots of things from them, that going to the liquor
###1293 store in two different cars early on a Sunday morning is a
###1296 family affair.
###1297 And it's great, families sticking close together.
###1301 We learned that if you're a 15 or 16-year-old woman that's
###1306 pregnant, that's carrying, that's holding,
###1308 you shouldn't drink.
###1308 But it's OK to smoke.
###1310 We pretty much fucking rocked this town.
###1311 We came in.
###1312 We rocked it hard.
###1313 The chickens got rocked.
###1315 The cows got rocked.
###1316 The locals got rocked.
###1318 And that's about all I have to say about that.
###1321 
###1352 MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]
###1353 
###1356 DAVID CHOE: That's party is this possible.
###1359 FEMALE SPEAKER: All right.
###1361 DAVID CHOE: Take care, guys.
###1362 FEMALE SPEAKER: Bye.
###1363 MALE SPEAKER: Bye.
###1364 
###1366 DAVID CHOE: Excuse me, sir.
###1368 
###1371 I'm sorry to bother you.
###1372 But me and my friend, we're the two guys that just played
###1376 in the bar right here.
###1378 Do you think--
###1380 I mean, I think we could fit.
###1383 Do you think you could give us a ride into Texas?
###1385 MALE SPEAKER: To where?
###1385 DAVID CHOE: To Texas?
###1387 MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.
###1387 [INAUDIBLE].
###1388 DAVID CHOE: I mean, just anywhere.
###1389 Just we've been in town for so long.
###1391 We just want to get a ride out.
###1394 MALE SPEAKER: OK.
###1395 
###1416 DAVID CHOE: So two in the morning.
###1419 We just entered Amarillo, Texas.
###1422 God bless Texas.
###1424 We are in Texas.
###1425 Things get weird in Texas.
###1428 [BLEEP]'s one of my favorite 24 hour diners that doesn't
###1432 exist in California.
###1434 Surprisingly, we haven't hit one of them
###1436 since our whole journey.
###1437 And this is the first one in Texas.
###1439 And our waitresses--
###1442 very nice, very kind, very shy--
###1444 would not go on camera, As we were paying the check, I asked
###1446 them, because this place is known to have the most insane
###1449 people coming in at all hours--
###1451 and I just asked them who are the worst people ever that
###1454 come in here.
###1454 And I thought she was going to say drunks or something.
###1456 All the waitresses at the same time chime in--
###1459 the blacks.
###1460 The blacks?
###1461 OK.
###1462 And explain why.
###1464 So the reasons why the blacks are the worst.
###1468 And this is not just at four in the morning
###1470 when they're drunk.
###1470 It's at all hours.
###1472 They're annoying.
###1473 They're loud.
###1475 And why they choose [BLEEP], not IHOP or Denny's is because
###1479 chicken and waffles.
###1480 And it's cheap.
###1482 And so according to Texas [BLEEP]
###1485 Amarillo, the blacks are the worst people.
###1489 I disagree.
###1490 
###1492 Besides truck stops, 24 hour super mega-mats can be a haven
###1496 for drifters like us.
###1500 And I will show you why in one second.
###1503 Come on.
###1503 Follow me.
###1504 Let's go.
###1505 
###1509 Besides the awesome savings, when you get here late at
###1512 night, everyone is cracked out, including the workers.
###1514 Sp they pretty much let you get away with murder.
###1517 We got an awesome ride and if we are lucky, a
###1522 good place to sleep.
###1524 
###1530 Do you remember these things, this fun game you played when
###1533 you were kids.
###1535 You just open up.
###1538 And you go to sleep.
###1539 Good night.
###1540
