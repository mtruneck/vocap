2
0:0:0,7 --> 0:0:3,54
Back in the strip club,
that's like basically


3
0:0:3,54 --> 0:0:5,5
my spiritual heaven.

5
0:0:10,77 --> 0:0:12,25
Here we have Gucci Mane.


6
0:0:12,25 --> 0:0:14,13
He's exactly like
what you would


7
0:0:14,13 --> 0:0:16,21
imagine him to be, amazing.


8
0:0:16,21 --> 0:0:19,34
He was in his element in the
strip club, for sure, had his


9
0:0:19,34 --> 0:0:20,49
game face on.


10
0:0:20,49 --> 0:0:24,57
We lit the whole club with these
insane red and green


11
0:0:24,57 --> 0:0:26,46
neon filters and gels.


12
0:0:26,46 --> 0:0:29,5
And everyone was super high.


13
0:0:29,5 --> 0:0:31,78
That's a lot of Gucci's crew
in the movie, and I think a


14
0:0:31,78 --> 0:0:32,77
lot in real life.


15
0:0:32,77 --> 0:0:36,64
You got Gucci's real life
manager on the side, Coach K,


16
0:0:36,64 --> 0:0:37,92
holding a pistol.


17
0:0:37,92 --> 0:0:39,545
That's a serious
OG right there.


18
0:0:39,545 --> 0:0:43,435
Here we go with Franco, again
Franco and strippers, we had


19
0:0:43,435 --> 0:0:44,97
to throw some money.


20
0:0:44,97 --> 0:0:48,6
This is Dangeruss, a rapper
from Saint Petersburg.


21
0:0:48,6 --> 0:0:51,41
I put him together with Franco
before the movie.


22
0:0:51,41 --> 0:0:52,47
They hung out.


23
0:0:52,47 --> 0:0:55,36
And he was kind of a
character study.


24
0:0:55,36 --> 0:0:58,44
These guys in here are pretty
much the real deal.


25
0:0:58,44 --> 0:0:59,51
These dudes are legit.


26
0:0:59,51 --> 0:1:3,7
So I think Franco got a lot
for his performance.


27
0:1:3,7 --> 0:1:6,57
The actual location had these
amazing neons, these purple


28
0:1:6,57 --> 0:1:7,47
[INAUDIBLE]


29
0:1:7,47 --> 0:1:9,36
candy-colored lights.


30
0:1:9,36 --> 0:1:13,7
There's a palette I thought
coincided with that world.


31
0:1:13,7 --> 0:1:15,91
The colors of nail polish became
fluorescent colors.


32
0:1:15,91 --> 0:1:18,47
Benoit would shoot in these
super vibrant filters.


33
0:1:18,47 --> 0:1:22,82
So we would pick a look, almost
like in this weird


34
0:1:22,82 --> 0:1:26,49
magical realism, or this kind
of idea that things are just


35
0:1:26,49 --> 0:1:29,0
the real world, except pushed
it into something hyper


36
0:1:29,0 --> 0:1:31,93
extreme, hyper beautiful.
