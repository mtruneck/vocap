0:0:0,813 --> 0:0:5,76
Conflict resolution or
how to avoid conflict


2
0:0:5,76 --> 0:0:9,233
with other people is a typical
problem of everybody.


3
0:0:9,233 --> 0:0:14,793
The reason for conflict is because
people come from different places


4
0:0:14,793 --> 0:0:18,646
different environments, and
they bring with them attitudes


5
0:0:18,646 --> 0:0:23,52
which they picked up there.
Merely commanding another person


6
0:0:23,52 --> 0:0:27,881
saying to another person "You ought
not to think the way you think"


7
0:0:27,881 --> 0:0:30,843
does not alter the behavior.


8
0:0:30,843 --> 0:0:34,368
If you really want to
get along with people


9
0:0:34,368 --> 0:0:36,695
only when they say to you


10
0:0:36,695 --> 0:0:41,393
"What's the best way to put the shovel
into the ground?" "Use your foot.


11
0:0:41,393 --> 0:0:46,361
It's easier.
" If they don't ask you, let it go.


12
0:0:46,361 --> 0:0:49,348
The best way to avoid
conflict is to not


13
0:0:49,348 --> 0:0:52,592
superimpose your values,
even though they're better


14
0:0:52,592 --> 0:0:55,35
than the other person's values.


15
0:0:55,35 --> 0:0:58,911
Roxanne may like cats.


16
0:0:58,911 --> 0:1:3,165
I don't like cats in the
house because they...


17
0:1:3,165 --> 0:1:7,838
I feel that they're dirty
and all that, but anyway...


18
0:1:7,838 --> 0:1:12,517
The question is: How
much do I like Roxanne?


19
0:1:12,517 --> 0:1:14,98
If she doesn't mean
that much to me


20
0:1:14,98 --> 0:1:17,495
I say "The cats go or I'll go."


21
0:1:17,495 --> 0:1:20,744
When you deal with people


22
0:1:20,744 --> 0:1:24,284
whatever their views are,
unless they say to you


23
0:1:24,284 --> 0:1:29,561
"What do you think of my views?
" then you can give your opinion.


24
0:1:29,561 --> 0:1:32,949
Like sometimes


25
0:1:32,949 --> 0:1:36,221
Joel may feel that his boss


26
0:1:36,221 --> 0:1:39,48
is not correct in his values.


27
0:1:39,48 --> 0:1:43,9
If you were to confront
him with saner values


28
0:1:43,9 --> 0:1:45,445
he would not understand it.


29
0:1:45,445 --> 0:1:51,219
He would resent it too
because it's a put-down.


30
0:1:51,219 --> 0:1:53,321
When you meet people


31
0:1:53,321 --> 0:1:57,184
they tell you what their values
are by the way they speak


32
0:1:57,184 --> 0:2:0,18
the way they talk about
different things.


33
0:2:0,18 --> 0:2:3,931
Unless they say to you "What
do you think of my values?"


34
0:2:3,931 --> 0:2:9,638
then you open up, or "What do you think
of the way I use the paintbrush?"


35
0:2:9,638 --> 0:2:12,519
If they say to you "That's
no way to use a paintbrush"


36
0:2:12,519 --> 0:2:14,781
that doesn't tell you how.


37
0:2:14,781 --> 0:2:19,645
You wipe it on the can, or
whatever it is, you can tell them.


38
0:2:19,645 --> 0:2:23,903
Very few people, unless they're
going to school to study


39
0:2:23,903 --> 0:2:29,719
aviation mechanics, they go there
to learn what this guy has to say


40
0:2:29,719 --> 0:2:33,247
but if one of the students
tells them something


41
0:2:33,247 --> 0:2:35,95
they would feel put-down.


42
0:2:35,95 --> 0:2:40,436
The student says "Well, you
don't understand the mechanics


43
0:2:40,436 --> 0:2:44,23
of a piston engine.
" That's a put-down


44
0:2:44,23 --> 0:2:48,678
because the student is telling that.
If the instructor told him that


45
0:2:48,678 --> 0:2:52,647
he went there to study
plumbing or art


46
0:2:52,647 --> 0:2:56,66
or music, so you listen
to an instructor.


47
0:2:56,66 --> 0:2:59,757
You're there to learn what
they have to tell you


48
0:2:59,757 --> 0:3:2,306
but when you meet
ordinary people...


49
0:3:2,306 --> 0:3:5,782
If Roxanne is working
on something


50
0:3:5,782 --> 0:3:10,261
and it's very important to her,
and there's a phone call


51
0:3:10,261 --> 0:3:12,708
which detracts her
away from that


52
0:3:12,708 --> 0:3:16,283
and she may go back and not
continue along the lines.


53
0:3:16,283 --> 0:3:22,139
If you say "You should continue along
the lines you're working at..."


54
0:3:22,139 --> 0:3:27,222
Unless she said "Christ,
I'm terribly disorganized


55
0:3:27,222 --> 0:3:29,465
what do you suggest I do?"


56
0:3:29,465 --> 0:3:33,1
Then you write 1,2,3,4,5


57
0:3:33,1 --> 0:3:36,45
and she says "I don't
like 4 and 5."


58
0:3:36,45 --> 0:3:41,3
But don't argue with her.
If she says "I'm not sure of 4 and 5"


59
0:3:41,3 --> 0:3:44,709
then you can instruct her.
The language tells you


60
0:3:44,709 --> 0:3:48,857
when a person wants to
hear more or no more.


61
0:3:48,857 --> 0:3:52,827
Anything you say is a
put-down to normal people


62
0:3:52,827 --> 0:3:56,771
if it improves, if
it's overseeing


63
0:3:56,771 --> 0:4:0,372
overseeing the other
person's shortcomings.


64
0:4:0,372 --> 0:4:3,881
If another person
has shortcomings


65
0:4:3,881 --> 0:4:8,539
you work with those
shortcomings, unless they say


66
0:4:8,539 --> 0:4:12,177
"How were you able to
accomplish four films a day


67
0:4:12,177 --> 0:4:14,408
and I can only do one?"


68
0:4:14,408 --> 0:4:18,978
Then you can say "Because you
clean out, you bake with the oven


69
0:4:18,978 --> 0:4:22,325
and then you water the lawn,
then you go back to your job."


70
0:4:22,325 --> 0:4:26,375
You have to stay with each system.
Do you understand what I mean?


71
0:4:26,375 --> 0:4:31,158
If you get out to do a bridge and
in the meantime you water the roses


72
0:4:31,158 --> 0:4:35,538
and trim trees, a lot of
things remain half-done.


73
0:4:35,538 --> 0:4:37,678
I don't say you do that


74
0:4:37,678 --> 0:4:43,114
but if you walk over to Larry and say
"Don't do it that way. Do it this way"


75
0:4:43,114 --> 0:4:46,843
you're superimposing your values.
They may be right


76
0:4:46,843 --> 0:4:50,381
but you don't superimpose
unless they ask you.


77
0:4:50,381 --> 0:4:52,633
Conflict occurs


78
0:4:52,633 --> 0:4:57,37
when a person doesn't seek your
advice and you advise them.


79
0:4:57,37 --> 0:5:0,297
It doesn't always
occur, but it will.


80
0:5:0,297 --> 0:5:2,801
The way to get along with people


81
0:5:2,801 --> 0:5:7,623
is to let them be what
they are, unless they say


82
0:5:7,623 --> 0:5:12,268
"I don't seem to get along with polocks.
What's my problem?"


83
0:5:12,268 --> 0:5:14,661
Very few people do that.


84
0:5:14,661 --> 0:5:18,427
Very few people... In fact I've
never run into a person that said


85
0:5:18,427 --> 0:5:22,109
"What do you think
of my value system?


86
0:5:22,109 --> 0:5:25,265
What do you think of
the way I think?"


87
0:5:25,265 --> 0:5:30,132
If they do that and it's
sincere, not an ego thing


88
0:5:30,132 --> 0:5:35,73
where they appear to be polite.


89
0:5:35,73 --> 0:5:39,678
If a person annoys
you in some way


90
0:5:39,678 --> 0:5:44,101
just say "I don't like
to discuss races.


91
0:5:44,101 --> 0:5:47,929
I mean if you want to be racist
OK, I'm not interested in that."


92
0:5:47,929 --> 0:5:51,187
If he says "How come you don't
see niggers the way I see them?"


93
0:5:51,187 --> 0:5:53,617
you can explain.


94
0:5:53,617 --> 0:5:58,471
But if he says "Well, God damn it,
that's the way I feel," let him talk


95
0:5:58,471 --> 0:6:4,418
or discharge him, if you hired him
and you don't want to hear that.


96
0:6:4,418 --> 0:6:8,497
We hired a guy...
There was a black man up on a pole


97
0:6:8,497 --> 0:6:11,8
working on an antenna.


98
0:6:11,8 --> 0:6:14,362
And the guy says "I
need some rope."


99
0:6:14,362 --> 0:6:17,906
He says "Tie it around your neck.
If you fall you'll hang yourself."


100
0:6:17,906 --> 0:6:21,77
He thought that was appropriate
for the black guy.


101
0:6:21,77 --> 0:6:26,34
We never hired him again
because he was too low grade.


102
0:6:26,34 --> 0:6:30,832
To undo that, you have
to undo his whole life


103
0:6:30,832 --> 0:6:34,292
and either you hire a guy
to put up an antenna


104
0:6:34,292 --> 0:6:36,782
or you work on his whole life.


105
0:6:36,782 --> 0:6:42,281
The question is: How different is
the person's background than yours?


106
0:6:42,281 --> 0:6:47,319
Does the person seek
information and if they did


107
0:6:47,319 --> 0:6:50,25
don't feel like you're
instructing them.


108
0:6:50,25 --> 0:6:55,2
If you come over and say
"Larry, that's no way to use


109
0:6:55,2 --> 0:6:56,741
a paint remover"


110
0:6:56,741 --> 0:6:59,753
the best thing to do is to say
"I used to do it that way


111
0:6:59,753 --> 0:7:2,443
then some other guy
told me another way."


112
0:7:2,443 --> 0:7:6,572
They don't like personal
criticism coming from you.


113
0:7:6,572 --> 0:7:9,765
I don't get involved in
that kind of discussion


114
0:7:9,765 --> 0:7:13,28
because it can't go anywhere,
unless the person says


115
0:7:13,28 --> 0:7:17,158
"What do you think of the God damn
Mexicans coming into this country?"


116
0:7:17,158 --> 0:7:22,159
"I think the same way
about 'unloyal' Americans


117
0:7:22,159 --> 0:7:27,264
that don't appreciate this country,"
instead of attacking the Spanish people.


118
0:7:27,264 --> 0:7:32,404
Say, "I find Americans, some
of them, to be very offensive


119
0:7:32,404 --> 0:7:37,29
and some to be OK" but you need
not get onto the Spaniards


120
0:7:37,29 --> 0:7:40,506
because he has a fixed
view of Spaniards.


121
0:7:40,506 --> 0:7:44,2
You say "There are plenty of
Americans that are subversive."


122
0:7:44,2 --> 0:7:46,609
He would agree
with you as a rule


123
0:7:46,609 --> 0:7:51,205
and if he says "Well, I don't know,
I've found an American..." then get off


124
0:7:51,205 --> 0:7:54,1
if he doesn't want to discuss it


125
0:7:54,1 --> 0:7:57,821
if he feels satisfied
with his point of view.


126
0:7:57,821 --> 0:8:0,455
The main thing you
have to keep in mind


127
0:8:0,455 --> 0:8:3,398
is other people come
from different places


128
0:8:3,398 --> 0:8:5,835
and they see the
same thing you see


129
0:8:5,835 --> 0:8:8,156
but their interpretation
is different.


130
0:8:8,156 --> 0:8:10,712
Unless they call for answers


131
0:8:10,712 --> 0:8:13,42
"What do you think
I ought to do?"


132
0:8:13,42 --> 0:8:16,211
If a person has a short
memory, make notes.


133
0:8:16,211 --> 0:8:18,498
You tell them that once or twice


134
0:8:18,498 --> 0:8:22,537
but not continuously,
if they don't apply it.


135
0:8:22,537 --> 0:8:25,213
You give people instructions.


136
0:8:25,213 --> 0:8:29,393
If they apply it, give
them further instructions.


137
0:8:29,393 --> 0:8:35,424
If they don't apply them, it means
it's just a verbal pastime.


138
0:8:35,424 --> 0:8:41,689
"What do you suggest I do?
My wife likes cats, and I like dogs."


139
0:8:41,689 --> 0:8:44,433
You don't have to come
up with some story:


140
0:8:44,433 --> 0:8:48,143
Let her have her cats so she
lets you have your dogs.


141
0:8:48,143 --> 0:8:52,46
In working with conflict


142
0:8:52,46 --> 0:8:54,681
you do it once or twice.


143
0:8:54,681 --> 0:8:59,0
You say "It seems to me if
you held the drill this way


144
0:8:59,0 --> 0:9:3,302
first, it would work better
and that's what I found."


145
0:9:3,302 --> 0:9:6,199
But if a person doesn't ask
you and they're busy drilling


146
0:9:6,199 --> 0:9:9,1
and they say "I don't
want your fuckin' advice!


147
0:9:9,1 --> 0:9:13,33
You tend to your computer,
I'll tend to my drilling."


148
0:9:13,33 --> 0:9:19,361
Sometimes people don't want advice.
They feel they're being put down.


149
0:9:19,361 --> 0:9:23,9
Stop giving one another advice.
That produces antagonism


150
0:9:23,9 --> 0:9:25,62
unless they ask for it.


151
0:9:25,62 --> 0:9:27,985
Is this an absolute formula?


152
0:9:27,985 --> 0:9:30,284
It's a better way of
dealing with people


153
0:9:30,284 --> 0:9:33,55
because you can't
turn them around


154
0:9:33,55 --> 0:9:36,233
by pointing out "The
trouble with you is


155
0:9:36,233 --> 0:9:40,988
you don't listen to anybody!
" That doesn't cause them to now listen.


156
0:9:40,988 --> 0:9:43,228
They'll go on with
their same pattern


157
0:9:43,228 --> 0:9:46,685
unless they say to you
"Am I inattentive?"


158
0:9:46,685 --> 0:9:49,368
or "Do I appear inattentive?"


159
0:9:49,368 --> 0:9:53,65
Very few people talk like that.
That's what sane means.


160
0:9:53,65 --> 0:9:56,491
Sane means, when a person
comes over to you and says


161
0:9:56,491 --> 0:10:0,967
"I'm not familiar with that
jigsaw, how to use it."


162
0:10:0,967 --> 0:10:4,417
Then you instruct them.
If they come over


163
0:10:4,417 --> 0:10:7,714
everyday and say "I don't
know how to use a jigsaw"


164
0:10:7,714 --> 0:10:11,2
watch them and guide
them through it.


165
0:10:11,2 --> 0:10:13,388
Does that make sense?


166
0:10:13,388 --> 0:10:16,478
Do you have any attitudes
now about different people


167
0:10:16,478 --> 0:10:19,102
that think differently
than you do?


168
0:10:19,102 --> 0:10:21,752
They think differently
than you do, period.


169
0:10:21,752 --> 0:10:25,371
Making a comment as "You're
dimwitted" or "slow"


170
0:10:25,371 --> 0:10:28,234
"The trouble with you is that
you have no imagination!"


171
0:10:28,234 --> 0:10:32,823
that doesn't alter behavior.
It only increases conflict.


172
0:10:32,823 --> 0:10:35,967
Do you understand
what I'm saying?


173
0:10:35,967 --> 0:10:39,774
If a person's a very
good painter of roses


174
0:10:39,774 --> 0:10:44,56
and you like roses, then you
associate with him for that reason


175
0:10:44,56 --> 0:10:46,4
but if he says "If
you just ask me


176
0:10:46,4 --> 0:10:49,744
all the Irish ought to
be sent back to Ireland"


177
0:10:49,744 --> 0:10:54,342
say "Well, I don't feel
that way about the Irish


178
0:10:54,342 --> 0:10:56,85
so I'd rather not discuss it."


179
0:10:56,85 --> 0:10:59,9
"I think there are
Swedes that behave badly


180
0:10:59,9 --> 0:11:4,483
and some Swedes that behave well.
" You can say that.


181
0:11:4,483 --> 0:11:9,248
He might understand that "...
but I appreciate your comments."


182
0:11:9,248 --> 0:11:12,633
Don't wipe him out.
"You're a racist!"


183
0:11:12,633 --> 0:13:12,633
Don't wipe him out.
