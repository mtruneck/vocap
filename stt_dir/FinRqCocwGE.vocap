###10 SUROOSH ALVI: We're here in Lahore,
###10 Pakistan, in the old city.
###14 I'm here visiting family.
###15 It's been about three years since I was in the country.
###17 And in that time, the country has gone through insane
###20 amounts of change--
###21 truly full of deep contradictions.
###24 On the one hand, you've got this progressive side of the
###26 population.
###27 They're organizing fashion weeks.
###28 They're partying.
###30 And you've got this liberal media explosion happening in
###34 this country.
###35 
###38 And they're operating uncensored by the government.
###40 
###47 On the other side, you got the Taliban.
###49 They've been infiltrating the entire country, attacking
###52 police stations and government buildings in a
###54 recent wave of violence.
###56 It's now escalated into a full-fledged battle with the
###58 Pakistani Army fighting the Taliban in the tribal areas
###61 near the Afghan border.
###64 We travelled to this area three years ago when we wanted
###66 to visit a massive illegal arms market believed to be a
###69 source of weapons for the Taliban.
###71 It's been called the most dangerous place in the world
###73 and is now basically closed outside of the journalists.
###77 So I asked my mom to call her buddy.
###78 He is the chief secretary of the Northwest Frontier
###81 Province of Pakistan.
###82 With his help, we got our own private militia.
###85 And they made sure we wouldn't get kidnapped or killed.
###87 
###90 
###94 SUROOSH ALVI: Naeem, who is our host, is part of the
###96 Afridi tribe.
###98 He is born and raised there, now works as a protocol
###100 officer for the government.
###103 He put them together for us.
###104 He got us through, dealt with a huge amount of bureaucracy,
###107 and got the militia to cover us as we
###109 went through the market.
###110 Is this loaded?
###111 NAEEM AFRIDI: Yes, this is loaded, but they're locked.
###113 SUROOSH ALVI: They locked it.
###114 Where's the lock?
###115 
###119 SUROOSH ALVI: It's the most historic pass in the history
###121 of the world.
###122 The Aryans came through.
###123 The Mongols came through.
###125 The British Army came through and got destroyed--
###127 special place.
###128 
###131 SUROOSH ALVI: Thanks, buddy.
###133 [PARADE MUSIC]
###156 
###168 SUROOSH ALVI: He's the founder of the heroin trade.
###172 
###177 SUROOSH ALVI: The concept?
###180 SUROOSH ALVI: Of what?
###181 
###194 SUROOSH ALVI: It's a very special Italian hat.
###195 NAEEM AFRIDI: I will try my best to--
###198 SUROOSH ALVI: Oh god.
###200 No.
###203 After Khyber, we went into Darra.
###205 That's where the arms market is.
###207 So when you were explaining to the officials what we wanted
###209 to do, the old man started laughing when you said we
###212 wanted to shoot guns and maybe buy some guns.
###214 I think he liked that idea.
###216 SUROOSH ALVI: He liked that idea.
###219 SUROOSH ALVI: He was laughed.
###222 
###238 SUROOSH ALVI: This is definitely the largest illegal
###240 arms market in the world.
###242 There is another one in Pakistan.
###243 It's not quite as big.
###244 And the story is that during the '80s, the Soviet-Afghan
###248 war was happening.
###249 All the scrap metal from all the broken-down tanks and guns
###254 they would find, they would bring it back over and then
###257 replicate the firearms.
###259 
###286 SUROOSH ALVI: So in the whole town, they're making 1,000
###287 guns a day here.
###288 And they've been doing that for 70 years.
###290 That's a lot of guns.
###291 So this guy is making 9-millimeter pistols with his
###295 bare hands.
###296 The guy who's making it is deaf.
###300 It's a Mauser but says "Made as China
###304 by Norinco." [GRUNTING]
###309 SUROOSH ALVI: This is the cartridge.
###311 He has no tongue.
###314 3,050 rupees?
###318 We're hearing lots of guns being shot around us.
###321 And they're just checking to make sure that the guns work.
###324 They're doing it with live ammo.
###325 What I'm wondering is, they shoot it up in the air, where
###329 do the bullets fall?
###330 
###339 SUROOSH ALVI: It's time we go gun shopping.
###342 This is an Italian machine.
###345 This is like a Kalashnikov?
###346 MALE SPEAKER: Kalakov.
###347 SUROOSH ALVI: Kalakov.
###348 It says it's a Muzzelite.
###350 
###354 I think we can do some damage with this.
###355 
###370 The original Khyber rifle--
###372 so in 1857, the British gave the Afghanis 10,000 of these.
###376 I don't even know how to cock this thing.
###378 Where do you put the bullet in?
###380 [INTERPOSING VOICES]
###381 SUROOSH ALVI: The musket?
###382 The musket is where you put it in.
###385 MALE SPEAKER: Nazi gun.
###386 German.
###387 SUROOSH ALVI: Germany.
###389 World War II, Nazi gun--
###392 pure evil in my hand.
###393 
###401 MALE SPEAKER: Suroosh, now we are going into
###403 the shooting area.
###405 Yes?
###406 Let's go.
###407 SUROOSH ALVI: Bullet.
###408 
###411 So we were wondering, were they following me?
###412 MALE SPEAKER: They're not going far from us.
###416 SUROOSH ALVI: If not, I'm going to keep it.
###417 NAEEM AFRIDI: Yes, keep it.
###419 
###421 SUROOSH ALVI: You got to be kidding.
###422 This is the shooting area?
###423 We just had lunch downstairs.
###425 NAEEM AFRIDI: Yes.
###426 SUROOSH ALVI: All right.
###426 Let's do this.
###429 I'm shooting the enemies in the hills.
###432 I've never done this before.
###433 It's a Kalashnikov.
###435 And we're kind of nervous.
###438 I see my target.
###440 [GUNFIRE]
###453 EDDY MORETTI: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###454 [GUNFIRE]
###460 SUROOSH ALVI: America thought that by sending in troops to
###461 Afghanistan and the Pakistani Army into the tribal areas,
###464 they'd to be able to squash the Taliban uprising.
###467 They were wrong.
###469 The people we saw live in caves.
###471 They work in insane conditions.
###472 They have no tongues.
###474 They make guns with their bare hands.
###476 We're done.
###476 We succeeded our mission.
###477 We came to Darra.
###478 And we bought guns.
###479 We shot them.
###480 We saw how it all happens.
###482 
###485 If you come here, you got to make sure you look the part.
###487 And you've got to have a guy like Naeem
###489 to make it all happen.
###491 SUROOSH ALVI: And one last thing--
###492 NAEEM AFRIDI: Goodbye to the gun.
###492 SUROOSH ALVI: --Pakistan Zindabad.
###494 
###503 Three years ago, when we filmed in Darra, after we
###505 left, the government basically shut it down.
###508 They shut it down to outsiders and journalists because the
###511 Pakistani Army was in there fighting the Taliban.
###514 And right now, between the Pakistani Army and the US
###517 troops on the border, the Taliban inside the tribal
###519 areas, it's essentially a powder keg
###522 that's ready to blow.
###523 The military expert that we know, he described the
###526 situation as the wickedest problem you
###529 could possibly imagine.
