0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:1,59



2
0:0:1,59 --> 0:0:5,72
FEMALE SPEAKER: So as many of
you, I'm sure, already know,


3
0:0:5,72 --> 0:0:9,15
George Saunders has been
charming readers and critics


4
0:0:9,15 --> 0:0:13,11
alike for years with his
truly unique brand


5
0:0:13,11 --> 0:0:15,54
of speculative fiction.


6
0:0:15,54 --> 0:0:18,88
He's the recipient of a
MacArthur Grant, as well as a


7
0:0:18,88 --> 0:0:22,11
professor of creative writing
at Syracuse University.


8
0:0:22,11 --> 0:0:25,83
And lucky us-- he's here
to promote his--


9
0:0:25,83 --> 0:0:27,8
what was, for me at
least-- a long


10
0:0:27,8 --> 0:0:30,9
awaited new book of stories.


11
0:0:30,9 --> 0:0:32,96
By the way, "Tenth of December"
is available in the


12
0:0:32,96 --> 0:0:36,9
back via Books Inc. Thank
you so much, you guys.


13
0:0:36,9 --> 0:0:39,61
And please help me welcome
George Saunders.


14
0:0:39,61 --> 0:0:44,956
[APPLAUSE]


15
0:0:44,956 --> 0:0:45,93
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Thank you.


16
0:0:45,93 --> 0:0:48,32
Thanks everybody for being
here-- nice to see you all.


17
0:0:48,32 --> 0:0:50,24
I thought I would just
read a little sample


18
0:0:50,24 --> 0:0:51,7
from the new book.


19
0:0:51,7 --> 0:0:54,65
And then we could just talk
informally about writing, or


20
0:0:54,65 --> 0:0:58,22
maybe the creative process,
or whatever comes up.


21
0:0:58,22 --> 0:1:1,18
So this first thing, I'll
just read a little--


22
0:1:1,18 --> 0:1:4,2
I was on a reading tour a couple
years ago and I drew


23
0:1:4,2 --> 0:1:7,2
this Polish driver
who was done.


24
0:1:7,2 --> 0:1:8,6
He'd driven enough.


25
0:1:8,6 --> 0:1:9,92
And he was like a zen driver.


26
0:1:9,92 --> 0:1:11,82
He could drive without
getting you anywhere.


27
0:1:11,82 --> 0:1:12,9
[LAUGHTER]


28
0:1:12,9 --> 0:1:15,14
And he was taking me to this
bookstore reading, and he


29
0:1:15,14 --> 0:1:18,81
said, "Sir, you go now to do
reading?" I said, "Yeah." He


30
0:1:18,81 --> 0:1:20,41
said, "Little advice for you.


31
0:1:20,41 --> 0:1:25,11
Don't read too long." And I
thought, oh you know my work.


32
0:1:25,11 --> 0:1:27,38
But basically, you never leave
a literary reading going,


33
0:1:27,38 --> 0:1:29,26
damn, I wish he'd read
another 40 minutes.


34
0:1:29,26 --> 0:1:31,36
So I'll just give you
a little sample.


35
0:1:31,36 --> 0:1:36,96
And I never was a big sci-fi
reader as a kid.


36
0:1:36,96 --> 0:1:41,1
Except the one real big moment
of my reading, or my cultural


37
0:1:41,1 --> 0:1:44,45
life, was that moment in Star
Wars when the ships come over


38
0:1:44,45 --> 0:1:45,92
and you can see that
they're dented and


39
0:1:45,92 --> 0:1:47,19
rusty and fucked up.


40
0:1:47,19 --> 0:1:50,8
And I thought that was really
a major revelation.


41
0:1:50,8 --> 0:1:52,28
So some of my stuff
is kind of sci-fi.


42
0:1:52,28 --> 0:1:54,44
This is definitely
kind of sci-fi.


43
0:1:54,44 --> 0:1:56,99
And I think it's self
explanatory.


44
0:1:56,99 --> 0:2:0,34
But basically, this
guy is in a--


45
0:2:0,34 --> 0:2:3,62
well, you don't where he is
at first-- but he's being


46
0:2:3,62 --> 0:2:6,19
ritually administered these
different kinds of drugs.


47
0:2:6,19 --> 0:2:10,35
And these drugs, as they do,
they change everything.


48
0:2:10,35 --> 0:2:12,39
So he's, you'll see in the
course of the story, there's


49
0:2:12,39 --> 0:2:16,7
some inflections in his voice
and consciousness that are


50
0:2:16,7 --> 0:2:17,94
from these drugs that are
being dripped in.


51
0:2:17,94 --> 0:2:20,74
And later you find out that
actually he's in prison.


52
0:2:20,74 --> 0:2:23,66
And his mom has scratched some
money together to get him into


53
0:2:23,66 --> 0:2:26,75
this slightly nicer prison,
where instead of being a


54
0:2:26,75 --> 0:2:28,71
prisoner, you're--


55
0:2:28,71 --> 0:2:31,13
what did we used to call it in
the corporate world-- like a


56
0:2:31,13 --> 0:2:32,16
research assistant.


57
0:2:32,16 --> 0:2:33,92
[LAUGHTER]


58
0:2:33,92 --> 0:2:35,98
So this is a little section
from "Escape from


59
0:2:35,98 --> 0:2:41,41
Spiderhead." "One.


60
0:2:41,41 --> 0:2:45,31
Drip on?" Abnesti said
over the P.A.


61
0:2:45,31 --> 0:2:47,24
"What's in it?," I said.


62
0:2:47,24 --> 0:2:49,42
"Hilarious," he said.


63
0:2:49,42 --> 0:2:51,98
"Acknowledge," I said.


64
0:2:51,98 --> 0:2:53,95
Abnesti used his remote.


65
0:2:53,95 --> 0:2:57,24
My MobiPak trademark word.


66
0:2:57,24 --> 0:3:0,78
Soon the interior garden
looked really nice.


67
0:3:0,78 --> 0:3:3,51
Everything seemed super clear.


68
0:3:3,51 --> 0:3:5,14
I said out loud, as
I was supposed


69
0:3:5,14 --> 0:3:8,27
to, what I was feeling.


70
0:3:8,27 --> 0:3:11,9
"Garden looks nice," I
said. "Super clear."


71
0:3:11,9 --> 0:3:14,98
Abnesti said, "Jeff, how about
we pep up those language


72
0:3:14,98 --> 0:3:18,52
centers?" "Sure," I said.


73
0:3:18,52 --> 0:3:21,2
"Drip on?" he said.


74
0:3:21,2 --> 0:3:24,1
"Acknowledge," I said.


75
0:3:24,1 --> 0:3:28,17
He added some Verbaluce to the
drip, and soon I was feeling


76
0:3:28,17 --> 0:3:31,3
the same things but saying
them better.


77
0:3:31,3 --> 0:3:32,96
The garden still looked nice.


78
0:3:32,96 --> 0:3:36,65
It was like the bushes were so
tight seeming and the sun made


79
0:3:36,65 --> 0:3:38,91
everything stand out.


80
0:3:38,91 --> 0:3:43,71
It was like any moment you
expected some Victorians to


81
0:3:43,71 --> 0:3:46,37
wander in with their
cups of tea.


82
0:3:46,37 --> 0:3:48,62
It was as if the garden had
become a sort of embodiment of


83
0:3:48,62 --> 0:3:50,67
the domestic dreams forever
intrinsic to human


84
0:3:50,67 --> 0:3:52,87
consciousness.


85
0:3:52,87 --> 0:3:55,22
It was as if I could suddenly
discern, in this contemporary


86
0:3:55,22 --> 0:3:58,33
vignette, the ancient corollary,
through which Plato


87
0:3:58,33 --> 0:4:0,81
and some of his contemporaries
might have strolled; to wit I


88
0:4:0,81 --> 0:4:4,43
was sensing the eternal
and the ephemeral.


89
0:4:4,43 --> 0:4:6,66
I sat pleasantly engaged in
these thoughts until the


90
0:4:6,66 --> 0:4:8,93
Verbaluce began to wane.


91
0:4:8,93 --> 0:4:13,36
At which point, the garden
just looked nice again.


92
0:4:13,36 --> 0:4:16,17
It was something about the
bushes and whatnot.


93
0:4:16,17 --> 0:4:18,525
It made you just want to lay out
there and catch rays and


94
0:4:18,525 --> 0:4:21,399
think your happy thoughts,
if you get what I mean.


95
0:4:21,399 --> 0:4:23,55
Then whatever else was in the
drip wore off, and I didn't


96
0:4:23,55 --> 0:4:27,11
feel much about the garden
one way or the other.


97
0:4:27,11 --> 0:4:30,19
My mouth was dry though and my
gut had that post Verbaluce


98
0:4:30,19 --> 0:4:31,93
feel to it.


99
0:4:31,93 --> 0:4:34,4
"What's going to be cool about
that one?" Abnesti said, "Is,


100
0:4:34,4 --> 0:4:37,95
say a guy has to stay up late
guarding a perimeter or is at


101
0:4:37,95 --> 0:4:40,64
school waiting for his kid and
gets bored, but there's some


102
0:4:40,64 --> 0:4:42,31
nature nearby.


103
0:4:42,31 --> 0:4:46,22
Or say a park ranger has to
work a double shift."


104
0:4:46,22 --> 0:4:48,4
"That'll be cool," I said.


105
0:4:48,4 --> 0:4:51,42
"That's ED763," he said. "We're
thinking of calling it


106
0:4:51,42 --> 0:4:56,73
NatuGlide or maybe ErthAdmire."
"Those are both


107
0:4:56,73 --> 0:4:58,5
good," I said.


108
0:4:58,5 --> 0:5:1,17
"Thanks for your help, Jeff,"
he said, which is what he


109
0:5:1,17 --> 0:5:3,3
always said.


110
0:5:3,3 --> 0:5:5,8
"Only a million years to
go," I said, which is


111
0:5:5,8 --> 0:5:8,5
what I always said.


112
0:5:8,5 --> 0:5:10,49
Then he said, "Exit the interior
garden now, Jeff.


113
0:5:10,49 --> 0:5:15,56
Head over to small workroom
two." Into small workroom two


114
0:5:15,56 --> 0:5:18,62
they sent this pale,
tall girl.


115
0:5:18,62 --> 0:5:23,2
"What do you think?" Abnesti
said over the P.A. "Me?" I


116
0:5:23,2 --> 0:5:28,48
said, "Or her?" "Both,"
Abnesti said.


117
0:5:28,48 --> 0:5:30,59
"Pretty good," I said.


118
0:5:30,59 --> 0:5:34,7
"Fine, you know," she said,
"normal." Abnesti then asked


119
0:5:34,7 --> 0:5:36,77
us to rate each other more
quantifiably as per


120
0:5:36,77 --> 0:5:39,66
pretty, as per sexy.


121
0:5:39,66 --> 0:5:43,1
It appeared we liked each other
about average, i.e. no


122
0:5:43,1 --> 0:5:46,6
big attraction or revulsion
either way.


123
0:5:46,6 --> 0:5:50,86
Abnesti said, "Jeff, drip on?"
"Acknowledge," I said.


124
0:5:50,86 --> 0:5:53,48
"Heather, drip on?" he said.


125
0:5:53,48 --> 0:5:56,32
"Acknowledge," Heather said.


126
0:5:56,32 --> 0:6:0,54
Then we looked at each other
like, what happens next?


127
0:6:0,54 --> 0:6:5,56
What happened next was Heather
soon looked super good.


128
0:6:5,56 --> 0:6:8,31
And I could tell she thought
the same of me.


129
0:6:8,31 --> 0:6:9,285
It came on so sudden.


130
0:6:9,285 --> 0:6:10,48
We were like laughing.


131
0:6:10,48 --> 0:6:12,18
How could we not
have seen it--


132
0:6:12,18 --> 0:6:14,21
how cute the other one was?


133
0:6:14,21 --> 0:6:16,99
Luckily, there was a couch
in the workroom.


134
0:6:16,99 --> 0:6:19,52
It felt like our drip had, in
addition to whatever they were


135
0:6:19,52 --> 0:6:23,28
testing, some ED556 in it, which
lowers your shame level


136
0:6:23,28 --> 0:6:25,35
to like nil.


137
0:6:25,35 --> 0:6:28,12
Because soon, there on the
couch, off we went.


138
0:6:28,12 --> 0:6:30,94
It was super hot between
us, and not merely


139
0:6:30,94 --> 0:6:32,16
in a horndog way.


140
0:6:32,16 --> 0:6:34,32
Hot yes, but also just right--


141
0:6:34,32 --> 0:6:36,97
like if you dreamed of a certain
girl all your life and


142
0:6:36,97 --> 0:6:40,78
all of a sudden there she was
in your same workroom.


143
0:6:40,78 --> 0:6:43,7
"Jeff," Abnesti said, "I'd like
your permission to pep up


144
0:6:43,7 --> 0:6:45,9
your language centers?"
"Go for it," I


145
0:6:45,9 --> 0:6:49,53
said, under her now.


146
0:6:49,53 --> 0:6:50,77
"Drip on," he said.


147
0:6:50,77 --> 0:6:53,2
"Acknowledge," I said.


148
0:6:53,2 --> 0:6:54,57
"Me too," Heather said.


149
0:6:54,57 --> 0:6:56,455
"You got it," Abnesti
said with a laugh.


150
0:6:56,455 --> 0:6:59,88
"Drip on?" "Acknowledge,"
she said all breathless.


151
0:6:59,88 --> 0:7:1,68
Soon, experiencing the benefits
of the flowing


152
0:7:1,68 --> 0:7:4,49
Verbaluce in our drips, we were
not only fucking really


153
0:7:4,49 --> 0:7:7,78
well, but also talking
pretty great.


154
0:7:7,78 --> 0:7:9,97
Like instead of just saying the
sex types of things we had


155
0:7:9,97 --> 0:7:12,84
been saying, such as wow, and
oh God, and hell yes, and so


156
0:7:12,84 --> 0:7:16,77
forth, we now began free styling
re our sensations and


157
0:7:16,77 --> 0:7:21,39
thoughts in elevated diction
with 80% increased vocab, our


158
0:7:21,39 --> 0:7:22,66
well articulated thoughts being


159
0:7:22,66 --> 0:7:25,32
recorded for later analysis.


160
0:7:25,32 --> 0:7:27,61
For me the feeling was
approximately astonishment at


161
0:7:27,61 --> 0:7:29,82
the dawning realization that
this woman was being created


162
0:7:29,82 --> 0:7:32,7
in real time, directly
from my own mind,


163
0:7:32,7 --> 0:7:34,4
per my deepest longings.


164
0:7:34,4 --> 0:7:36,11
Finally, after all these years,
was my thought, I'd


165
0:7:36,11 --> 0:7:38,772
found the precise arrangement
of body, face, mind that


166
0:7:38,772 --> 0:7:41,2
personified all that
was desirable.


167
0:7:41,2 --> 0:7:44,42
The taste of her mouth, that
look of that halo of blondish


168
0:7:44,42 --> 0:7:46,51
hair spread out around
her cherubic, yet


169
0:7:46,51 --> 0:7:47,89
naughty looking face.


170
0:7:47,89 --> 0:7:50,0
She was beneath me
now, legs way up.


171
0:7:50,0 --> 0:7:52,87
Even, not to be crude or
dishonor the exalted feelings


172
0:7:52,87 --> 0:7:55,22
I was experiencing, the
sensations her vagina was


173
0:7:55,22 --> 0:7:57,37
producing along the length of
my thrusting penis were


174
0:7:57,37 --> 0:8:1,1
precisely those I had
always hungered for.


175
0:8:1,1 --> 0:8:3,51
Though I had never before this
instant realized that I so


176
0:8:3,51 --> 0:8:5,67
ardently hungered for them.


177
0:8:5,67 --> 0:8:8,69
That is to say a desire would
arise, and concurrently, the


178
0:8:8,69 --> 0:8:12,0
satisfaction of that desire
would also arise.


179
0:8:12,0 --> 0:8:15,35
It was as if A, I longed for a
certain heretofore untasted


180
0:8:15,35 --> 0:8:19,1
taste, until B, said longing
became nearly unbearable, at


181
0:8:19,1 --> 0:8:22,79
which time C, I found a morsel
of food with that exact taste


182
0:8:22,79 --> 0:8:26,61
already in my mouth, perfectly
satisfying my longing.


183
0:8:26,61 --> 0:8:29,6
Every utterance, every
adjustment of posture, bespoke


184
0:8:29,6 --> 0:8:29,83
the same thing.


185
0:8:29,83 --> 0:8:32,576
We had known each other forever,
were soulmates, had


186
0:8:32,576 --> 0:8:35,299
met and loved in numerous
preceding lifetimes and would


187
0:8:35,299 --> 0:8:38,9
meet and love in many subsequent
lifetimes, always


188
0:8:38,9 --> 0:8:41,82
with the same transcendentally
stupefying results.


189
0:8:41,82 --> 0:8:43,96
Then there came a hard to
describe, but very real,


190
0:8:43,96 --> 0:8:47,25
drifting off into a number of
sequential reveries that might


191
0:8:47,25 --> 0:8:49,96
best be described as a
type of nonnarrative


192
0:8:49,96 --> 0:8:51,86
mind scenery, i.e.


193
0:8:51,86 --> 0:8:54,56
A series of vague mental images
of places I had never


194
0:8:54,56 --> 0:8:57,26
been, a certain pine packed
valley in high white


195
0:8:57,26 --> 0:9:0,84
mountains, a chalet type house
in a cul-de-sac, the yard of


196
0:9:0,84 --> 0:9:4,26
which was overgrown with wide,
stunted, Seussian trees, each


197
0:9:4,26 --> 0:9:7,41
of which triggered a deep
sentimental longing--


198
0:9:7,41 --> 0:9:10,352
longings that coalesced into and
were soon reduced to one


199
0:9:10,352 --> 0:9:11,99
central longing, i.e.


200
0:9:11,99 --> 0:9:15,69
An intense longing for Heather,
and Heather alone.


201
0:9:15,69 --> 0:9:18,47
This mind scenery phenomenon was
strongest during our third


202
0:9:18,47 --> 0:9:20,2
bout of lovemaking.


203
0:9:20,2 --> 0:9:22,6
Apparently Abnesti
had included some


204
0:9:22,6 --> 0:9:24,91
Vivistif in my drip.


205
0:9:24,91 --> 0:9:27,21
Afterward our protestations
of love poured forth


206
0:9:27,21 --> 0:9:30,6
simultaneously, linguistically
complex and


207
0:9:30,6 --> 0:9:31,42
metaphorically rich.


208
0:9:31,42 --> 0:9:34,13
I dare say we had
become poets.


209
0:9:34,13 --> 0:9:36,12
We were allowed to lie there,
limbs intermingled


210
0:9:36,12 --> 0:9:37,6
for nearly an hour.


211
0:9:37,6 --> 0:9:41,18
It was bliss, it was perfection,
it was that


212
0:9:41,18 --> 0:9:42,37
impossible thing--


213
0:9:42,37 --> 0:9:45,6
happiness that does not wilt to
reveal the thin shoots of


214
0:9:45,6 --> 0:9:48,23
some new desire rising
from within it.


215
0:9:48,23 --> 0:9:50,51
We cuddled with a
fierceness/focus that rivaled


216
0:9:50,51 --> 0:9:53,65
the fierceness/focus with
which we had fucked.


217
0:9:53,65 --> 0:9:57,38
There is nothing less about
cuddling vis-a-vis fucking, is


218
0:9:57,38 --> 0:9:58,96
what I mean to say.


219
0:9:58,96 --> 0:10:1,48
We were all over each other in
the super friendly way of


220
0:10:1,48 --> 0:10:5,31
puppies or spouses meeting for
the first time after one of


221
0:10:5,31 --> 0:10:7,93
them has undergone a close
brush with death.


222
0:10:7,93 --> 0:10:13,12
Everything seemed moist,
permeable, sayable.


223
0:10:13,12 --> 0:10:16,47
Then something in the
drip began to wane.


224
0:10:16,47 --> 0:10:19,4
I think Abnesti had shut
off the Verbaluce,


225
0:10:19,4 --> 0:10:21,7
also the shame reducer.


226
0:10:21,7 --> 0:10:24,77
Basically, everything
began to dwindle.


227
0:10:24,77 --> 0:10:29,6
Suddenly we felt shy,
but still loving.


228
0:10:29,6 --> 0:10:32,14
We began the process of trying
to talk apres Verbaluce--


229
0:10:32,14 --> 0:10:33,81
always awkward.


230
0:10:33,81 --> 0:10:36,16
Yet, I could see in her eyes
that she was still feeling


231
0:10:36,16 --> 0:10:38,8
love for me, and I was
definitely still


232
0:10:38,8 --> 0:10:40,81
feeling love for her.


233
0:10:40,81 --> 0:10:41,94
Well, why not?


234
0:10:41,94 --> 0:10:44,41
We had just fucked
three times.


235
0:10:44,41 --> 0:10:47,36
Why do you think they
call it making love?


236
0:10:47,36 --> 0:10:49,11
That is what we had just
made three times--


237
0:10:49,11 --> 0:10:50,91
love.


238
0:10:50,91 --> 0:10:54,22
Then Abnesti said, "Drip on?"


239
0:10:54,22 --> 0:10:56,38
We had kind of forgotten he was
even there behind his one


240
0:10:56,38 --> 0:10:58,27
way mirror.


241
0:10:58,27 --> 0:10:59,76
I said, "Do we have to?


242
0:10:59,76 --> 0:11:2,98
We are really liking this right
now." "We're just going


243
0:11:2,98 --> 0:11:5,18
to try to get you guys back to
baseline," he said. "We've got


244
0:11:5,18 --> 0:11:7,0
more to do today."


245
0:11:7,0 --> 0:11:8,58
"Shit," I said.


246
0:11:8,58 --> 0:11:10,99
"Rats," she said.


247
0:11:10,99 --> 0:11:13,44
"Drip on?" Abnesti said.


248
0:11:13,44 --> 0:11:16,1
"Acknowledge," we said.


249
0:11:16,1 --> 0:11:18,8
Soon something began
to change.


250
0:11:18,8 --> 0:11:25,33
I mean, she was fine, a
handsome, pale girl, but


251
0:11:25,33 --> 0:11:27,48
nothing special.


252
0:11:27,48 --> 0:11:30,75
And I could see that she felt
the same about me, i.e what


253
0:11:30,75 --> 0:11:33,14
had all that fuss been
about just now?


254
0:11:33,14 --> 0:11:35,91
Why weren't we dressed?


255
0:11:35,91 --> 0:11:38,32
We real quick got dressed--


256
0:11:38,32 --> 0:11:40,17
kind of embarrassing.


257
0:11:40,17 --> 0:11:42,9
Did I love her, or
did she love me?


258
0:11:42,9 --> 0:11:45,34
Ha, no.


259
0:11:45,34 --> 0:11:47,56
Then it was time
for her to go.


260
0:11:47,56 --> 0:11:49,45
We shook hands.


261
0:11:49,45 --> 0:11:51,33
Out she went.


262
0:11:51,33 --> 0:11:53,47
Lunch came in on a tray--


263
0:11:53,47 --> 0:11:56,6
spaghetti with chicken chunks.


264
0:11:56,6 --> 0:11:58,8
Man was I hungry.


265
0:11:58,8 --> 0:11:59,59
I spent all of lunch
time thinking.


266
0:11:59,59 --> 0:12:0,14
It was weird.


267
0:12:0,14 --> 0:12:2,78
I had the memory of fucking
Heather, the memory of having


268
0:12:2,78 --> 0:12:5,61
felt the things I'd felt for
her, the memory of having said


269
0:12:5,61 --> 0:12:7,38
the things I'd said to her.


270
0:12:7,38 --> 0:12:10,7
My throat was like raw from how
much I'd said and how fast


271
0:12:10,7 --> 0:12:12,1
I felt compelled to say it.


272
0:12:12,1 --> 0:12:16,69
But in terms of feelings, I
basically had nada left--


273
0:12:16,69 --> 0:12:19,9
just a hot face and some shame
re having fucked three times


274
0:12:19,9 --> 0:12:22,0
in front of Abnesti.


275
0:12:22,0 --> 0:12:24,43
So I'll stop there and deliver
what "Reading Rainbow" calls a


276
0:12:24,43 --> 0:12:28,29
cliffhanger, and thank you.


277
0:12:28,29 --> 0:12:29,1
[INAUDIBLE]


278
0:12:29,1 --> 0:12:35,23
[APPLAUSE]


279
0:12:35,23 --> 0:12:39,7
So now, if anybody has a
question I'm happy to take it.


280
0:12:39,7 --> 0:12:41,38
And there's a funny
phenomenon.


281
0:12:41,38 --> 0:12:42,3
I've been doing a
lot of readings.


282
0:12:42,3 --> 0:12:46,14
And there's this weird thing
where invariably the person


283
0:12:46,14 --> 0:12:48,33
who asks the first question is
the one with the highest


284
0:12:48,33 --> 0:12:50,6
sexual energy in
the gathering.


285
0:12:50,6 --> 0:12:51,61
[LAUGHTER]


286
0:12:51,61 --> 0:12:52,0
It's weird.


287
0:12:52,0 --> 0:12:54,12
It's like some kind of
Darwinian thing.


288
0:12:54,12 --> 0:12:58,131
[LAUGHTER]


289
0:12:58,131 --> 0:13:0,92
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].


290
0:13:0,92 --> 0:13:3,872
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Yeah, I
had an idea it was you.


291
0:13:3,872 --> 0:13:5,122
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].


292
0:13:5,122 --> 0:13:7,17



293
0:13:7,17 --> 0:13:8,47
AUDIENCE: I had the opportunity
the other day to


294
0:13:8,47 --> 0:13:11,67
read a little "New York Times
Magazine" article about you.


295
0:13:11,67 --> 0:13:15,64
And in the back, at the bottom
of it, they mentioned that you


296
0:13:15,64 --> 0:13:17,12
studied or practiced
some [? Yingla ?]


297
0:13:17,12 --> 0:13:17,81
Buddhism.


298
0:13:17,81 --> 0:13:18,21
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Yeah.


299
0:13:18,21 --> 0:13:21,21
AUDIENCE: And a lot of this
stuff, in terms of perception


300
0:13:21,21 --> 0:13:24,52
and having alternate viewpoints,
different ways of


301
0:13:24,52 --> 0:13:26,83
understanding our experience
and reality, particularly


302
0:13:26,83 --> 0:13:30,1
generating experience and being
able to appreciate that


303
0:13:30,1 --> 0:13:32,15
and work with that came out.


304
0:13:32,15 --> 0:13:36,93
And I wanted to, I guess hear a
couple points about how you


305
0:13:36,93 --> 0:13:41,34
deal with the flexibility of
understanding how we perceive


306
0:13:41,34 --> 0:13:42,51
things and how we generate
[INAUDIBLE].


307
0:13:42,51 --> 0:13:43,52
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Sure, that's
a great question.


308
0:13:43,52 --> 0:13:47,93
I think, for me, that the answer
is a little simple,


309
0:13:47,93 --> 0:13:51,6
which is, for me, everything
that I do in fiction is


310
0:13:51,6 --> 0:13:53,79
through the language, like
the individual sentence.


311
0:13:53,79 --> 0:13:55,42
And it's a funny thing, because
when you're a young


312
0:13:55,42 --> 0:13:57,7
writer, you're concept heavy.


313
0:13:57,7 --> 0:14:0,44
And you usually participate
in some version of the


314
0:14:0,44 --> 0:14:4,9
intentional fallacy, which is
your job as a writer is to


315
0:14:4,9 --> 0:14:9,6
pull up the big shit truck full
of meaning or theme and


316
0:14:9,6 --> 0:14:10,75
get the reader [INAUDIBLE]


317
0:14:10,75 --> 0:14:13,14
sit there and, bam,
and drop that.


318
0:14:13,14 --> 0:14:16,9
And it's a fundamentally
condescending view.


319
0:14:16,9 --> 0:14:19,3
Which I think most of us when
we're young artists, we have


320
0:14:19,3 --> 0:14:22,2
that idea, that you're a good
artist to the extent that


321
0:14:22,2 --> 0:14:24,88
you're conveying some theme.


322
0:14:24,88 --> 0:14:28,42
So I had a long period of not
doing much in art, because I


323
0:14:28,42 --> 0:14:30,43
was operating under
that assumption.


324
0:14:30,43 --> 0:14:33,98
And I had a breakthrough where I
realized that in order to be


325
0:14:33,98 --> 0:14:36,32
in the kind of intimate
relationship you have to be in


326
0:14:36,32 --> 0:14:40,36
with your reader, you have to
commit to not being sure about


327
0:14:40,36 --> 0:14:40,96
what's happening.


328
0:14:40,96 --> 0:14:43,37
In other words, to come into
it with as low content as


329
0:14:43,37 --> 0:14:47,96
possible and feel your way
through it by watching the


330
0:14:47,96 --> 0:14:49,49
energy coming off the prose.


331
0:14:49,49 --> 0:14:54,23
So that's the main answer for
me, is as I'm writing I'm


332
0:14:54,23 --> 0:14:57,59
imagining an intelligent,
engaged person right over


333
0:14:57,59 --> 0:15:2,23
here, who's smart and is a
little skeptical and is


334
0:15:2,23 --> 0:15:6,36
watching me to see if I'm going
to pull any tricks.


335
0:15:6,36 --> 0:15:8,84
And I imagine a little gauge
in my head-- like positive


336
0:15:8,84 --> 0:15:10,3
over here and negative here.


337
0:15:10,3 --> 0:15:12,34
So as you're reading your own
prose, you're watching that


338
0:15:12,34 --> 0:15:15,33
needle, and you're trying to
keep it up in the positive.


339
0:15:15,33 --> 0:15:18,92
And when it gets negative, then
your job is to be all


340
0:15:18,92 --> 0:15:20,71
right with that.


341
0:15:20,71 --> 0:15:22,69
And like a scientist, to
say well, why did it


342
0:15:22,69 --> 0:15:24,91
do that do you think?


343
0:15:24,91 --> 0:15:28,26
Why is it on page two, nine
lines in, I just felt a little


344
0:15:28,26 --> 0:15:29,74
bit of a drop.


345
0:15:29,74 --> 0:15:32,3
And then, if you can avoid
answering that too


346
0:15:32,3 --> 0:15:35,14
reductively, then it opens up.


347
0:15:35,14 --> 0:15:38,5
So really, in a way, that's the
answer to your question.


348
0:15:38,5 --> 0:15:40,61
But I also was raised
Catholic.


349
0:15:40,61 --> 0:15:43,82
And we did this intense thing
called the stations of the


350
0:15:43,82 --> 0:15:45,86
cross, which maybe
some of you did.


351
0:15:45,86 --> 0:15:48,5
And this was the '60s,
so we really did it.


352
0:15:48,5 --> 0:15:51,38
We did it for five straight
days, naked in the desert


353
0:15:51,38 --> 0:15:53,13
being flayed.


354
0:15:53,13 --> 0:15:55,86
But the thing was, there were
these images of the suffering


355
0:15:55,86 --> 0:15:57,9
of Christ around the room.


356
0:15:57,9 --> 0:15:59,2
And so you sat and you
looked at each one.


357
0:15:59,2 --> 0:16:0,54
So now it was the
second station.


358
0:16:0,54 --> 0:16:3,57
And there was a little narration
from the Bible.


359
0:16:3,57 --> 0:16:7,31
And then you were to sit,
quietly, and think about it.


360
0:16:7,31 --> 0:16:9,92
And we had one nun who was
wonderful, because she would


361
0:16:9,92 --> 0:16:13,3
say, think about what was Jesus
experiencing and so on.


362
0:16:13,3 --> 0:16:15,17
And then she'd say, think about
what the Roman soldier


363
0:16:15,17 --> 0:16:16,63
was thinking.


364
0:16:16,63 --> 0:16:18,6
What about that guy-- there's an
image-- what about that guy


365
0:16:18,6 --> 0:16:19,29
standing to the side?


366
0:16:19,29 --> 0:16:20,89
What's his role?


367
0:16:20,89 --> 0:16:24,2
So that was early, like
Novel Writing 101.


368
0:16:24,2 --> 0:16:26,93
But from an early time, the idea
was a part of the fictive


369
0:16:26,93 --> 0:16:29,61
process was generating
empathy for somebody


370
0:16:29,61 --> 0:16:31,67
that you might not.


371
0:16:31,67 --> 0:16:33,152
I'm not sure if I'm answering
your question at all.


372
0:16:33,152 --> 0:16:34,96
[LAUGHTER]


373
0:16:34,96 --> 0:16:37,5
GEORGE SAUNDERS: And when
I was a child--


374
0:16:37,5 --> 0:16:38,53
Thank you for your question.


375
0:16:38,53 --> 0:16:39,3
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].


376
0:16:39,3 --> 0:16:42,19
It's really just about how to
appreciate the different ways


377
0:16:42,19 --> 0:16:43,502
of perceiving--


378
0:16:43,502 --> 0:16:45,56
like you were saying, like you
can have [INAUDIBLE] the


379
0:16:45,56 --> 0:16:47,47
different characters or
understanding that we create


380
0:16:47,47 --> 0:16:48,85
our reality to a
certain extent.


381
0:16:48,85 --> 0:16:49,2
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Exactly.


382
0:16:49,2 --> 0:16:51,52
And for me, one of the
interesting fictive points is


383
0:16:51,52 --> 0:16:53,61
that if you were trying to make
a quote, unquote accurate


384
0:16:53,61 --> 0:16:58,11
picture of this room, it would
probably consist of 107


385
0:16:58,11 --> 0:17:1,91
separate mind streams going
at once and occasionally


386
0:17:1,91 --> 0:17:3,25
interacting.


387
0:17:3,25 --> 0:17:6,69
And often the explosiveness of
the interaction has to do with


388
0:17:6,69 --> 0:17:8,0
the mind streams.


389
0:17:8,0 --> 0:17:9,77
He's thinking, no
one respects me.


390
0:17:9,77 --> 0:17:10,96
I never get a break.


391
0:17:10,96 --> 0:17:13,19
And then she's thinking about
her sick mother and she


392
0:17:13,19 --> 0:17:15,31
inadvertently steps
on his foot.


393
0:17:15,31 --> 0:17:17,6
And a shit storm happens.


394
0:17:17,6 --> 0:17:20,17
But actually it's not really
a physical, it's two mind


395
0:17:20,17 --> 0:17:24,0
streams bumping a little bit.


396
0:17:24,0 --> 0:17:25,814
Congratulations on your
sexual energy also.


397
0:17:25,814 --> 0:17:29,36
[LAUGHTER]


398
0:17:29,36 --> 0:17:32,16
AUDIENCE: I wondered if you
could say a few things about


399
0:17:32,16 --> 0:17:33,9
your influences.


400
0:17:33,9 --> 0:17:37,65
And the reason that I'm
interested in this is


401
0:17:37,65 --> 0:17:42,57
listening to you in this piece
resurrected for me a powerful


402
0:17:42,57 --> 0:17:44,76
memory of having read "Flowers
for Algernon."


403
0:17:44,76 --> 0:17:45,39
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Oh yeah, sure.


404
0:17:45,39 --> 0:17:47,8
Sure, yep.


405
0:17:47,8 --> 0:17:50,69
AUDIENCE: I feel like it's
really beautiful


406
0:17:50,69 --> 0:17:52,97
in a similar way.


407
0:17:52,97 --> 0:17:53,7
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Yeah, I know.


408
0:17:53,7 --> 0:17:54,51
I had the same-- when
I was writing the


409
0:17:54,51 --> 0:17:55,59
story, I went oh I remember.


410
0:17:55,59 --> 0:17:57,49
I didn't really remember the
details of the story, but I


411
0:17:57,49 --> 0:17:59,0
thought, oh I'm channeling
that.


412
0:17:59,0 --> 0:17:59,6
AUDIENCE: Yeah


413
0:17:59,6 --> 0:18:1,7
GEORGE SAUNDERS: You know I
think when I was younger, I


414
0:18:1,7 --> 0:18:4,21
hated any kind of suggestion
that my work had anything to


415
0:18:4,21 --> 0:18:6,8
do with anything that
had ever occurred.


416
0:18:6,8 --> 0:18:8,62
And then as you get older,
you're like well of course,


417
0:18:8,62 --> 0:18:11,3
where else are you going to
come from, except all the


418
0:18:11,3 --> 0:18:12,93
influences that have
passed through you?


419
0:18:12,93 --> 0:18:15,38
So in a way, that they might
be at the heart of that


420
0:18:15,38 --> 0:18:18,8
Picasso thing about, was it
good artists borrow, great


421
0:18:18,8 --> 0:18:20,2
artists steal?


422
0:18:20,2 --> 0:18:24,3
That saying, yeah of course, in
any kind of work none of us


423
0:18:24,3 --> 0:18:28,18
exist totally originally.


424
0:18:28,18 --> 0:18:31,37
And maybe your supplements as an
artist is your willingness


425
0:18:31,37 --> 0:18:33,71
to let those influences
flow through you.


426
0:18:33,71 --> 0:18:34,75
[INAUDIBLE]


427
0:18:34,75 --> 0:18:36,46
And then the other thing I
noticed is when you're on a


428
0:18:36,46 --> 0:18:38,6
book tour that you always get
the influence question.


429
0:18:38,6 --> 0:18:42,97
And the first thing is to go,
well of course, Shakespeare.


430
0:18:42,97 --> 0:18:45,0
Jesus, Mother Teresa was
quite important, right?


431
0:18:45,0 --> 0:18:47,9
But then when you really think
about it, for me, the '70s


432
0:18:47,9 --> 0:18:49,24
comics were usually--


433
0:18:49,24 --> 0:18:53,41
Steve Martin in his early
incarnation, Monty Python,


434
0:18:53,41 --> 0:18:54,25
George Carlin.


435
0:18:54,25 --> 0:18:58,29
And in our school, that was
really a way to get a little


436
0:18:58,29 --> 0:19:0,77
bit of credibility is that you
could stand up and recite the


437
0:19:0,77 --> 0:19:3,81
George Carlin album or do
a passable Steve Martin.


438
0:19:3,81 --> 0:19:7,58
So I had a long period where I
really considered that low--


439
0:19:7,58 --> 0:19:8,5
not literary.


440
0:19:8,5 --> 0:19:12,69
And because of where I came
from, I thought, well


441
0:19:12,69 --> 0:19:13,39
literature--


442
0:19:13,39 --> 0:19:14,57
I never had met writers.


443
0:19:14,57 --> 0:19:17,28
Literature is a thing that you
can't quite do, where you


444
0:19:17,28 --> 0:19:19,82
totally become someone else.


445
0:19:19,82 --> 0:19:22,25
And only at this crisis point,
I went well maybe not.


446
0:19:22,25 --> 0:19:25,31
Maybe literature is where you
really open up the valve to


447
0:19:25,31 --> 0:19:26,68
everybody that you've been.


448
0:19:26,68 --> 0:19:29,92
And for me that meant letting
in the sound of vestigial


449
0:19:29,92 --> 0:19:33,2
Steve Martin and the
Monty Python.


450
0:19:33,2 --> 0:19:35,95
So I think influence can
sometimes may be more full


451
0:19:35,95 --> 0:19:38,59
body than we think it is.


452
0:19:38,59 --> 0:19:39,96
AUDIENCE: Hi.


453
0:19:39,96 --> 0:19:43,32
I saw you come to Google
about five years ago.


454
0:19:43,32 --> 0:19:45,82
And I wanted to hear you talk
a little bit about what it


455
0:19:45,82 --> 0:19:49,79
must be like five years later
to have some of your stories


456
0:19:49,79 --> 0:19:52,8
coming true and we're
making them happen.


457
0:19:52,8 --> 0:19:54,56
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Yeah.


458
0:19:54,56 --> 0:19:57,5
AUDIENCE: My neighbors, for
example, just got some


459
0:19:57,5 --> 0:19:58,41
[INAUDIBLE]


460
0:19:58,41 --> 0:19:59,38
in Atherton.


461
0:19:59,38 --> 0:20:4,93
And so I was just wondering if
you draw, I guess, inspiration


462
0:20:4,93 --> 0:20:7,1
from Silicon Valley?


463
0:20:7,1 --> 0:20:13,4
Or if it's, I don't know, some
other level of inspiration?


464
0:20:13,4 --> 0:20:15,16
GEORGE SAUNDERS: I don't really
do a lot of research or


465
0:20:15,16 --> 0:20:16,74
direct tapping for ideas.


466
0:20:16,74 --> 0:20:21,55
But I think my feeling is that
if you were wired right, and


467
0:20:21,55 --> 0:20:25,0
if you were alert enough, even
the most banal moment would be


468
0:20:25,0 --> 0:20:26,94
crazy and full of wonder.


469
0:20:26,94 --> 0:20:30,61
So the fact that we're here,
we're at Google, we're feeling


470
0:20:30,61 --> 0:20:34,43
pretty good, most of us
are young, and yet


471
0:20:34,43 --> 0:20:35,62
we know for a fact--


472
0:20:35,62 --> 0:20:36,67
totally verifiable--


473
0:20:36,67 --> 0:20:38,6
that in x number of
years we'll all be


474
0:20:38,6 --> 0:20:40,0
rotting corpses somewhere.


475
0:20:40,0 --> 0:20:40,36
We know it.


476
0:20:40,36 --> 0:20:41,23
Why are we so happy?


477
0:20:41,23 --> 0:20:42,505
Why are we eating lunch?


478
0:20:42,505 --> 0:20:43,95
[LAUGHTER]


479
0:20:43,95 --> 0:20:46,48
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Or even to be
a little more serious, we


480
0:20:46,48 --> 0:20:50,62
venture forth every day in love
with somebody or somebody


481
0:20:50,62 --> 0:20:55,28
is beloved to us, and yet the
incredible vulnerability that


482
0:20:55,28 --> 0:20:57,47
everyone comes to an end,
including the people


483
0:20:57,47 --> 0:20:59,38
you love, for sure.


484
0:20:59,38 --> 0:21:1,2
So to me that--


485
0:21:1,2 --> 0:21:4,25
what's weird is the habitual
position of


486
0:21:4,25 --> 0:21:5,78
being OK with that.


487
0:21:5,78 --> 0:21:7,14
Yeah, I know it's true,
but my phone's a


488
0:21:7,14 --> 0:21:8,31
little low on battery.


489
0:21:8,31 --> 0:21:10,56
It's crazy really.


490
0:21:10,56 --> 0:21:15,67
So to me the inspiration for
the weird pieces is just


491
0:21:15,67 --> 0:21:18,69
through the writing process,
through revising, through


492
0:21:18,69 --> 0:21:22,1
trying not to be dull, to try
to get some sense of that


493
0:21:22,1 --> 0:21:24,24
wonder back into prose.


494
0:21:24,24 --> 0:21:28,9
So I don't really do a lot of
looking for weird things.


495
0:21:28,9 --> 0:21:32,53
Also, the other thing I notice,
I don't really have as


496
0:21:32,53 --> 0:21:35,12
much judgment about contemporary
culture as people


497
0:21:35,12 --> 0:21:35,99
think I do.


498
0:21:35,99 --> 0:21:36,9
I like it.


499
0:21:36,9 --> 0:21:38,19
I like everything.


500
0:21:38,19 --> 0:21:39,44
I like that--


501
0:21:39,44 --> 0:21:41,79



502
0:21:41,79 --> 0:21:43,47
I won't name companies-- but
some of the dangerous


503
0:21:43,47 --> 0:21:47,33
technological developments,
I think it's interesting.


504
0:21:47,33 --> 0:21:51,43
So to me, the highest position
is to have five or six


505
0:21:51,43 --> 0:21:55,78
opinions, all open,
on your desktop.


506
0:21:55,78 --> 0:21:58,98
And they contradict, and there's
no way to reconcile


507
0:21:58,98 --> 0:22:0,64
them, but you're OK
leaving them open.


508
0:22:0,64 --> 0:22:3,932
That would be the highest
aspiration.


509
0:22:3,932 --> 0:22:4,42
AUDIENCE: Hi.


510
0:22:4,42 --> 0:22:5,55
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Hi.


511
0:22:5,55 --> 0:22:8,46
AUDIENCE: When you have a story
that plays around with


512
0:22:8,46 --> 0:22:10,98
characters that are opposites,
do you ever find yourself


513
0:22:10,98 --> 0:22:12,65
having trouble sympathizing
with one?


514
0:22:12,65 --> 0:22:14,55
Or you sympathize more with
one over the other?


515
0:22:14,55 --> 0:22:16,32
GEORGE SAUNDERS:
Totally, yeah.


516
0:22:16,32 --> 0:22:18,88
The question is if there's two
different characters, do you


517
0:22:18,88 --> 0:22:19,74
have trouble with sympathy?


518
0:22:19,74 --> 0:22:21,8
And I think you absolutely do.


519
0:22:21,8 --> 0:22:21,94
And you should, really.


520
0:22:21,94 --> 0:22:23,69
It would be weird
if you didn't.


521
0:22:23,69 --> 0:22:27,19
But then I do this kind of
iterative revision thing,


522
0:22:27,19 --> 0:22:29,95
where I just go into it hundreds
and hundreds of


523
0:22:29,95 --> 0:22:32,65
times, each time tweaking a
little something or a lot--


524
0:22:32,65 --> 0:22:35,62
just expressing my opinion
on each draft.


525
0:22:35,62 --> 0:22:39,39
And what's interesting is if you
do that, the first step is


526
0:22:39,39 --> 0:22:41,91
to out yourself on your bias.


527
0:22:41,91 --> 0:22:44,77
Like in this book, there's
a story called "Puppy."


528
0:22:44,77 --> 0:22:48,92
And there's these two mothers
who are very similar, and they


529
0:22:48,92 --> 0:22:50,6
had the same interests.


530
0:22:50,6 --> 0:22:52,16
And in the end, it's
catastrophic what happens.


531
0:22:52,16 --> 0:22:57,1
And in that story, I definitely
had a bias for the


532
0:22:57,1 --> 0:22:58,73
poorer of the two women.


533
0:22:58,73 --> 0:23:1,64
But when I submitted it to the
"New Yorker." she said


534
0:23:1,64 --> 0:23:2,52
something really smart.


535
0:23:2,52 --> 0:23:5,95
She said, the way you're writing
her dialogue, you're


536
0:23:5,95 --> 0:23:7,48
condescending to her.


537
0:23:7,48 --> 0:23:10,87
Because I had written it really
straight white trash.


538
0:23:10,87 --> 0:23:12,62
And she said, that throws
the story off.


539
0:23:12,62 --> 0:23:13,825
You seem like you're making
fun of her and


540
0:23:13,825 --> 0:23:14,7
not the other one.


541
0:23:14,7 --> 0:23:17,28
So in that, the process
was to take her


542
0:23:17,28 --> 0:23:18,86
dialogue up a little bit.


543
0:23:18,86 --> 0:23:21,57
And in doing that, she became
a more full person.


544
0:23:21,57 --> 0:23:22,66
And I liked her better.


545
0:23:22,66 --> 0:23:25,17
So for that story, the critical
thing was to do just


546
0:23:25,17 --> 0:23:26,9
what you're saying-- adjust
it, so that there's some


547
0:23:26,9 --> 0:23:29,52
semblance of equity
between the two.


548
0:23:29,52 --> 0:23:31,72
But I think as a general writing
principle, your main


549
0:23:31,72 --> 0:23:35,36
job is to do something
and then notice it.


550
0:23:35,36 --> 0:23:38,6
And then adjust accordingly.


551
0:23:38,6 --> 0:23:40,24
And then notice the thing that
you've done, and adjust


552
0:23:40,24 --> 0:23:41,2
accordingly--


553
0:23:41,2 --> 0:23:43,99
rinse, lather, repeat
a million times.


554
0:23:43,99 --> 0:23:47,42
And then weirdly, in time, the
story will adjust itself


555
0:23:47,42 --> 0:23:50,54
morally to be more fair, which
is really a weird thing.


556
0:23:50,54 --> 0:23:51,61
But yeah, I think you should.


557
0:23:51,61 --> 0:23:54,22
Of course, you would.


558
0:23:54,22 --> 0:23:55,64
AUDIENCE: I think it's really
interesting what you said


559
0:23:55,64 --> 0:23:59,31
about acknowledging how your own
mindset has changed as a


560
0:23:59,31 --> 0:24:1,63
writer from a more professorial


561
0:24:1,63 --> 0:24:4,7
place to more engaging--


562
0:24:4,7 --> 0:24:7,5
to combine that with what sounds
like a very intense


563
0:24:7,5 --> 0:24:9,8
iterative visionary
writing style.


564
0:24:9,8 --> 0:24:11,92
Do you ever have the desire, or
do you ever go back to your


565
0:24:11,92 --> 0:24:14,92
earlier work thinking I
can punch this out.


566
0:24:14,92 --> 0:24:15,38
GEORGE SAUNDERS: No.


567
0:24:15,38 --> 0:24:17,755
It's so bad, I don't even try.


568
0:24:17,755 --> 0:24:18,85
I'll give you an example.


569
0:24:18,85 --> 0:24:19,89
This is a true story.


570
0:24:19,89 --> 0:24:25,5
My wife and I we got engaged in
three weeks, and we had a


571
0:24:25,5 --> 0:24:25,95
baby right away.


572
0:24:25,95 --> 0:24:26,85
And so we were racing.


573
0:24:26,85 --> 0:24:28,56
And I was working for a
company called Rating.


574
0:24:28,56 --> 0:24:32,26
I was a tech writer, and a very
low level tech writer.


575
0:24:32,26 --> 0:24:36,38
And my wife had been married
once before, and had a more


576
0:24:36,38 --> 0:24:38,64
full, better, a richer life--


577
0:24:38,64 --> 0:24:39,26
I'll put it that way.


578
0:24:39,26 --> 0:24:41,55
And I could feel her looking at
me like, come on, let's get


579
0:24:41,55 --> 0:24:42,32
something going.


580
0:24:42,32 --> 0:24:44,46
So I went on this
trip to Mexico.


581
0:24:44,46 --> 0:24:47,7
And it was this perfect
novelist trip.


582
0:24:47,7 --> 0:24:51,43
It was a wedding, there was a
male model slash surfer who


583
0:24:51,43 --> 0:24:53,11
was in the wedding party, there
was a guy who just out


584
0:24:53,11 --> 0:24:55,8
of jail for a DWI, there was
a radical Catholic priest.


585
0:24:55,8 --> 0:24:56,8
I'm like, this is it!


586
0:24:56,8 --> 0:24:59,36
It's a gift from God.


587
0:24:59,36 --> 0:25:0,52
So I came home.


588
0:25:0,52 --> 0:25:2,27
I'm like, honey, you're
sitting on a goldmine.


589
0:25:2,27 --> 0:25:3,56
Don't worry, I got it.


590
0:25:3,56 --> 0:25:6,21
So I wrote this novel for about
a year and a half, and


591
0:25:6,21 --> 0:25:8,32
we had one daughter
by that time.


592
0:25:8,32 --> 0:25:11,92
So I get home from work, drink
a pot of coffee, and if I was


593
0:25:11,92 --> 0:25:13,86
feeling really ambitious a
bottle of Boone's Farm, which


594
0:25:13,86 --> 0:25:15,38
is a deadly combo.


595
0:25:15,38 --> 0:25:18,4
And I would write just until I
would drop at the desk, go to


596
0:25:18,4 --> 0:25:20,6
work, and I did this for
a year and a half.


597
0:25:20,6 --> 0:25:21,96
And then I had the book.


598
0:25:21,96 --> 0:25:23,97
And it was 700 pages.


599
0:25:23,97 --> 0:25:26,37
And I thought, no I'm
a minimalist.


600
0:25:26,37 --> 0:25:27,32
So I cut it.


601
0:25:27,32 --> 0:25:30,81
I cut it to 400, rock hard.


602
0:25:30,81 --> 0:25:33,55
And so I said, I think I've got
a little novel for you to


603
0:25:33,55 --> 0:25:34,34
read, sweety.


604
0:25:34,34 --> 0:25:35,21
So she said, OK.


605
0:25:35,21 --> 0:25:37,35
So I said, just take
your time.


606
0:25:37,35 --> 0:25:38,5
I'll give you a week or so.


607
0:25:38,5 --> 0:25:40,85
And of course, like any writer,
in an hour later I'm


608
0:25:40,85 --> 0:25:42,22
looking in the room.


609
0:25:42,22 --> 0:25:46,84
And she's literally sitting at
the desk like this, fried.


610
0:25:46,84 --> 0:25:50,112
So to give you an idea, the
name of that book was "Le


611
0:25:50,112 --> 0:25:54,99
Bourda de Eduardo." Which I
think just means Ed's wedding.


612
0:25:54,99 --> 0:25:56,58
So I don't ever go
back to that.


613
0:25:56,58 --> 0:25:57,44
That stuff has a taint on it.


614
0:25:57,44 --> 0:25:59,5
I just would rather
move ahead.


615
0:25:59,5 --> 0:26:1,465
Thank you bringing up that
painful subject.


616
0:26:1,465 --> 0:26:5,19
[LAUGHTER]


617
0:26:5,19 --> 0:26:7,56
But the one thing that I am
interested in, and I'm sure


618
0:26:7,56 --> 0:26:11,89
this is true for you guys too,
in any kind of creative work,


619
0:26:11,89 --> 0:26:13,93
that moment where you--


620
0:26:13,93 --> 0:26:15,88
Donald Barthelme has a great
essay called "I'm not


621
0:26:15,88 --> 0:26:20,75
Knowing." And he says the
writer's that person who


622
0:26:20,75 --> 0:26:23,36
embarking on her task has
no idea what to do.


623
0:26:23,36 --> 0:26:26,42
And that, to me, seems like
the sacred state,


624
0:26:26,42 --> 0:26:27,64
if you can get there.


625
0:26:27,64 --> 0:26:30,1
And then Stuart Dybek, this
great Chicago writer, has this


626
0:26:30,1 --> 0:26:34,19
thing about the story Is
always talking to you.


627
0:26:34,19 --> 0:26:35,67
And your job is to listen.


628
0:26:35,67 --> 0:26:37,9
But for some reason, we have a
tendency to not really want to


629
0:26:37,9 --> 0:26:40,56
hear what the story's natural
energy is saying.


630
0:26:40,56 --> 0:26:42,31
But we want to override it.


631
0:26:42,31 --> 0:26:48,61
And so I was a geophysical
engineer, that was one of the


632
0:26:48,61 --> 0:26:51,37
big basic scientific principles
was you don't go


633
0:26:51,37 --> 0:26:54,96
into a study rooting
for some answer.


634
0:26:54,96 --> 0:26:57,71
So that was very helpful
in writing.


635
0:26:57,71 --> 0:26:59,64
AUDIENCE: I was wondering if
you could speak a bit about


636
0:26:59,64 --> 0:27:1,37
your editing process.


637
0:27:1,37 --> 0:27:3,911
Specifically, I read somewhere
that "The Semplica Girl


638
0:27:3,911 --> 0:27:10,41
Diaries" started out as a 200
page story and evolved into a


639
0:27:10,41 --> 0:27:11,6
10 page story.


640
0:27:11,6 --> 0:27:12,0
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Yeah.


641
0:27:12,0 --> 0:27:14,94
AUDIENCE: And I guess without
spoiling it for everyone, I'm


642
0:27:14,94 --> 0:27:16,99
wondering what got left out
and how you decided.


643
0:27:16,99 --> 0:27:17,94
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Sure.


644
0:27:17,94 --> 0:27:19,67
So the question is about
the editing process.


645
0:27:19,67 --> 0:27:21,81
And I had a story called "The
Semplica Girl Diaries" which


646
0:27:21,81 --> 0:27:24,53
started in '98 and I finish
it last spring.


647
0:27:24,53 --> 0:27:27,4
And it was up to some huge
number of pages and got


648
0:27:27,4 --> 0:27:29,98
drastically cut.


649
0:27:29,98 --> 0:27:33,68
One of my things is I think as
artists we have to submit to


650
0:27:33,68 --> 0:27:35,97
our neuroses a little bit.


651
0:27:35,97 --> 0:27:40,84
So often we think that to be an
artist, you have to conquer


652
0:27:40,84 --> 0:27:42,2
your neuroses and
be a perfectly


653
0:27:42,2 --> 0:27:43,44
calm, wonderful person.


654
0:27:43,44 --> 0:27:47,13
But my experience was rather
you turn towards with your


655
0:27:47,13 --> 0:27:49,95
ticks and go OK, come on.


656
0:27:49,95 --> 0:27:54,16
So for me I have a real, just
like inner nun syndrome, like


657
0:27:54,16 --> 0:27:56,69
I really don't like what I do.


658
0:27:56,69 --> 0:28:0,24
When I do it, I feel like, ugh,
Mr. Saunders, what do you


659
0:28:0,24 --> 0:28:2,76
think you are smarty pants?


660
0:28:2,76 --> 0:28:5,68
So that ends up to be, if you
keep it in check, a pretty


661
0:28:5,68 --> 0:28:9,16
valuable editing tool.


662
0:28:9,16 --> 0:28:11,43
And I have a slight aversion,
I've always had this since I


663
0:28:11,43 --> 0:28:14,93
was a kid, an aversion to what
I consider banal language.


664
0:28:14,93 --> 0:28:16,16
You know when you're in grade
school and they have those


665
0:28:16,16 --> 0:28:18,91
little readers, and it's like,
Jimmy was a bright happy boy


666
0:28:18,91 --> 0:28:20,52
as he bounced into the room
in the middle of a


667
0:28:20,52 --> 0:28:21,69
bright, fall day.


668
0:28:21,69 --> 0:28:23,3
It actually made me
a little sick.


669
0:28:23,3 --> 0:28:24,71
There was something
so unessential


670
0:28:24,71 --> 0:28:27,12
about it, and blah.


671
0:28:27,12 --> 0:28:29,52
So for me, one of the things
that I do is I'll get


672
0:28:29,52 --> 0:28:32,65
something up to a decent length,
pretty happily, with


673
0:28:32,65 --> 0:28:33,95
that feeling that all is well.


674
0:28:33,95 --> 0:28:39,99
And then that inner nun thing
will come in and speed it up.


675
0:28:39,99 --> 0:28:42,8
And I think the subtext to that
is do you respect your


676
0:28:42,8 --> 0:28:44,21
reader's intelligence?


677
0:28:44,21 --> 0:28:46,5
So I'll give you an exaggerated
example.


678
0:28:46,5 --> 0:28:50,11
If you have in a first draft
something like, Bob came


679
0:28:50,11 --> 0:28:53,55
happily into the room and sat
down on the blue couch.


680
0:28:53,55 --> 0:28:56,75
Perfectly functional
sentence right?


681
0:28:56,75 --> 0:29:0,91
But it bugs me, because you
think, wait, why does he have


682
0:29:0,91 --> 0:29:3,24
to sit down on a couch?


683
0:29:3,24 --> 0:29:5,59
Can you sit up on a couch?


684
0:29:5,59 --> 0:29:7,85
All right, well let's
cut the word down.


685
0:29:7,85 --> 0:29:9,94
Bob came happily into the room
and sat on the blue couch.


686
0:29:9,94 --> 0:29:12,96



687
0:29:12,96 --> 0:29:16,54
Why does he have to come
into the room?


688
0:29:16,54 --> 0:29:19,11
Is there any meaning to him
coming into the room?


689
0:29:19,11 --> 0:29:20,3
Not that we know of--


690
0:29:20,3 --> 0:29:21,91
OK, cut.


691
0:29:21,91 --> 0:29:23,27
Bob happily--


692
0:29:23,27 --> 0:29:24,34
I don't care.


693
0:29:24,34 --> 0:29:26,85
We don't care about
Bob's happiness.


694
0:29:26,85 --> 0:29:30,24
Bob sat on the blue couch.


695
0:29:30,24 --> 0:29:31,12
Blue?


696
0:29:31,12 --> 0:29:32,66
[LAUGHTER]


697
0:29:32,66 --> 0:29:33,69
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Does
blue signify?


698
0:29:33,69 --> 0:29:34,92
Not really--


699
0:29:34,92 --> 0:29:36,65
OK, Bob sat on the couch.


700
0:29:36,65 --> 0:29:40,31



701
0:29:40,31 --> 0:29:40,92
Bob?


702
0:29:40,92 --> 0:29:43,41
[LAUGHTER]


703
0:29:43,41 --> 0:29:44,8
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Cut it.


704
0:29:44,8 --> 0:29:47,72
So now we don't have much, but
what we have doesn't suck.


705
0:29:47,72 --> 0:29:49,23
We have Bob.


706
0:29:49,23 --> 0:29:52,84
So in a slightly less radical
way, I apply that kind of


707
0:29:52,84 --> 0:29:53,57
thinking to the story.


708
0:29:53,57 --> 0:29:57,78
And the logic is, if I'm making
those really seem like


709
0:29:57,78 --> 0:30:0,57
nitpicky decisions, every time
I do it, I'm honoring your


710
0:30:0,57 --> 0:30:2,67
intelligence a little bit.


711
0:30:2,67 --> 0:30:5,23
That which you could assume,
I'm going to assume that


712
0:30:5,23 --> 0:30:7,3
you're smart enough to assume.


713
0:30:7,3 --> 0:30:9,76
And in my model of reading, the
whole thing is to get you


714
0:30:9,76 --> 0:30:12,34
stepping closer and
closer and closer,


715
0:30:12,34 --> 0:30:14,57
trusting me more and more.


716
0:30:14,57 --> 0:30:16,93
And in the process of trusting
me more, the fictive reality


717
0:30:16,93 --> 0:30:19,1
is becoming more three
dimensional.


718
0:30:19,1 --> 0:30:21,59
And you get that magical
fictional moment where you and


719
0:30:21,59 --> 0:30:24,67
the character aren't different,
and you can't


720
0:30:24,67 --> 0:30:28,79
negotiate your way out of the
cliff that's approaching.


721
0:30:28,79 --> 0:30:31,3
And I think that process
is done--


722
0:30:31,3 --> 0:30:35,89
one way it can be done is by
this micro editing to assume


723
0:30:35,89 --> 0:30:36,1
intelligence.


724
0:30:36,1 --> 0:30:38,5
So on that story, it
was 180 pages.


725
0:30:38,5 --> 0:30:41,92
But at page 30, you were
asleep, basically.


726
0:30:41,92 --> 0:30:43,21
There was no urgency in it.


727
0:30:43,21 --> 0:30:45,87
So then part of the job is just
to say OK, those are just


728
0:30:45,87 --> 0:30:49,88
pages and now time
to trim it back.


729
0:30:49,88 --> 0:30:53,27
I don't know if that answers
your question, but yeah.


730
0:30:53,27 --> 0:30:53,42
AUDIENCE: Hi.


731
0:30:53,42 --> 0:30:53,81
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Hi.


732
0:30:53,81 --> 0:30:55,54
AUDIENCE: Thanks for
coming back.


733
0:30:55,54 --> 0:30:57,49
You just explained how you spent
actually quite a lot of


734
0:30:57,49 --> 0:30:59,26
time writing books.


735
0:30:59,26 --> 0:31:0,86
Ed's wedding was a
year and a half.


736
0:31:0,86 --> 0:31:1,33
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Yep.


737
0:31:1,33 --> 0:31:2,49
AUDIENCE: Stuff like that.


738
0:31:2,49 --> 0:31:5,57
How do you motivate yourself to
just keep on going through


739
0:31:5,57 --> 0:31:6,44
all that time?


740
0:31:6,44 --> 0:31:7,91
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Right.


741
0:31:7,91 --> 0:31:11,36
You know, honestly
it's just ego.


742
0:31:11,36 --> 0:31:12,87
I mean, I really like writing.


743
0:31:12,87 --> 0:31:14,5
And I like to be known
as a writer.


744
0:31:14,5 --> 0:31:16,25
And I like the whole schtick.


745
0:31:16,25 --> 0:31:20,4
But to me the most horrifying
moment is when you send


746
0:31:20,4 --> 0:31:24,82
something out too soon, or that
moment where you have


747
0:31:24,82 --> 0:31:27,99
misidentified something shitty
as good, and it's got your


748
0:31:27,99 --> 0:31:29,11
name on it.


749
0:31:29,11 --> 0:31:30,11
It's like ugh.


750
0:31:30,11 --> 0:31:30,8
It's a nightmare.


751
0:31:30,8 --> 0:31:37,15
So for me, I have from high
school, I loved the-- yeah.


752
0:31:37,15 --> 0:31:39,14
Some people, they want
to be songwriters or


753
0:31:39,14 --> 0:31:40,44
they want to be whatever.


754
0:31:40,44 --> 0:31:42,34
I really wanted to be a
short story writer.


755
0:31:42,34 --> 0:31:47,11
And it makes me really happy
to be in that harness.


756
0:31:47,11 --> 0:31:50,73
So I'll get something like that
"Semplica Girl Stories."


757
0:31:50,73 --> 0:31:53,79
I had it in pretty good
shape in 1999--


758
0:31:53,79 --> 0:31:55,11
pretty good.


759
0:31:55,11 --> 0:31:59,13
But on a scale of 10, it was
about a seven and a half.


760
0:31:59,13 --> 0:32:2,69
And I could feel that I could
get it up to 8.3 for sure.


761
0:32:2,69 --> 0:32:5,57
And at that point, I don't
really care how long it takes.


762
0:32:5,57 --> 0:32:8,2
So it's a lot of
negative urge--


763
0:32:8,2 --> 0:32:14,6
ego, grasping, desperation,
but also the pleasure.


764
0:32:14,6 --> 0:32:18,16
I feel like once you've taken
a story, any project you're


765
0:32:18,16 --> 0:32:21,56
in, once you've really stuck
with one to the end and seen


766
0:32:21,56 --> 0:32:24,41
the benefits, for me that's
a bit addictive.


767
0:32:24,41 --> 0:32:28,0
I know what a finished story
feels like, and I'm just not


768
0:32:28,0 --> 0:32:29,51
interested in not
getting there.


769
0:32:29,51 --> 0:32:33,16
So then it's weird, because it
becomes a suspension of time,


770
0:32:33,16 --> 0:32:36,12
where that story
took 12 years.


771
0:32:36,12 --> 0:32:37,37
That's all right.


772
0:32:37,37 --> 0:32:38,7
It's out.


773
0:32:38,7 --> 0:32:39,32
It's better than it was.


774
0:32:39,32 --> 0:32:42,7



775
0:32:42,7 --> 0:32:45,48
AUDIENCE: So I'm taking a short
story writing class up


776
0:32:45,48 --> 0:32:48,415
at Stanford, and we read
"CivilWarLand" in "Bad


777
0:32:48,415 --> 0:32:52,27
Decline." And the whole class
really loved the whole book.


778
0:32:52,27 --> 0:32:56,34
And we discuss your short
stories all the time.


779
0:32:56,34 --> 0:32:59,15
So I wanted to ask you as a
professor of creative writing,


780
0:32:59,15 --> 0:33:0,86
what do you think makes
a great writer?


781
0:33:0,86 --> 0:33:2,24
Is it experience?


782
0:33:2,24 --> 0:33:4,4
Is it focus?


783
0:33:4,4 --> 0:33:5,81
Is it getting an MFA?


784
0:33:5,81 --> 0:33:7,66
Is it getting a Ph.D.?


785
0:33:7,66 --> 0:33:11,6
Or being an engineer and then
having that experience?


786
0:33:11,6 --> 0:33:12,17
What do you think--


787
0:33:12,17 --> 0:33:12,89
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Right.


788
0:33:12,89 --> 0:33:17,393
Yeah, so if you can do all
of those, you're good.


789
0:33:17,393 --> 0:33:19,15
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].


790
0:33:19,15 --> 0:33:20,3
GEORGE SAUNDERS: No, that's
a great question.


791
0:33:20,3 --> 0:33:23,42
You know what's funny is that we
are in a moment in America


792
0:33:23,42 --> 0:33:27,52
where the MFA is getting
a big head.


793
0:33:27,52 --> 0:33:29,31
And Gary Shteyngart, he
had this great line.


794
0:33:29,31 --> 0:33:30,98
He said, we have reached the
point in American literary


795
0:33:30,98 --> 0:33:33,19
culture where the number of
readers is exactly equal to


796
0:33:33,19 --> 0:33:34,12
the number of writers.


797
0:33:34,12 --> 0:33:35,0
[LAUGHTER]


798
0:33:35,0 --> 0:33:36,74
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Yeah.


799
0:33:36,74 --> 0:33:39,35
And I teach in a
great program.


800
0:33:39,35 --> 0:33:42,14
But there's two fallacies that
need to be debunked.


801
0:33:42,14 --> 0:33:46,15
One is to be a writer, you
have to get an MFA.


802
0:33:46,15 --> 0:33:47,55
False.


803
0:33:47,55 --> 0:33:50,6
Two is if you get an MFA, you'll
be a published writer.


804
0:33:50,6 --> 0:33:52,6
False.


805
0:33:52,6 --> 0:33:54,41
We've seen a doubling
at Syracuse.


806
0:33:54,41 --> 0:33:57,3
When I go home I have
560 applications to


807
0:33:57,3 --> 0:33:58,78
read for six spots.


808
0:33:58,78 --> 0:34:2,39
And the vast majority are from
people who are just coming


809
0:34:2,39 --> 0:34:3,44
from undergrad.


810
0:34:3,44 --> 0:34:5,11
So there's something
weird about that.


811
0:34:5,11 --> 0:34:8,3
It's not quite right.


812
0:34:8,3 --> 0:34:11,489
But when they come, our students
are off the charts.


813
0:34:11,489 --> 0:34:15,48
But the thing we teach them-- we
try to teach them-- is that


814
0:34:15,48 --> 0:34:18,21
the answer to your question
is nobody knows.


815
0:34:18,21 --> 0:34:19,949
Nobody knows.


816
0:34:19,949 --> 0:34:22,36
You can be the smartest person
in the room, the most


817
0:34:22,36 --> 0:34:26,79
articulate, the most well
traveled, the most soulful,


818
0:34:26,79 --> 0:34:30,57
and you can put pen to paper and
you don't have any oomph.


819
0:34:30,57 --> 0:34:32,87
Or you can be a little
nondescript person with no


820
0:34:32,87 --> 0:34:36,389
opinions who just has never
really done anything, and


821
0:34:36,389 --> 0:34:39,34
somehow when you put the
pen to paper, this--


822
0:34:39,34 --> 0:34:42,139
So that's the hard thing.


823
0:34:42,139 --> 0:34:46,15
But it isn't true of anything
worth doing?


824
0:34:46,15 --> 0:34:48,699
There's an x factor
that's magical.


825
0:34:48,699 --> 0:34:51,3
So what you can do is
you can do the work.


826
0:34:51,3 --> 0:34:52,46
I think that's really
important.


827
0:34:52,46 --> 0:34:55,84
And I found out yesterday that
I've been telling a vicious


828
0:34:55,84 --> 0:34:58,8
lie about Robert Frost
for about 10 years.


829
0:34:58,8 --> 0:35:0,89
I had a student who told
me, I thought--


830
0:35:0,89 --> 0:35:2,1
I maybe misheard him--


831
0:35:2,1 --> 0:35:5,4
that Frost was doing a seminar
at a grad school.


832
0:35:5,4 --> 0:35:8,71
And a student asked a really
involved technical question


833
0:35:8,71 --> 0:35:9,85
about the sonnet.


834
0:35:9,85 --> 0:35:14,58
And Frost, to debunk his over
conceptual mind said, son,


835
0:35:14,58 --> 0:35:17,21
don't worry, work.


836
0:35:17,21 --> 0:35:18,88
And I've been saying for years,
that's great advice,


837
0:35:18,88 --> 0:35:21,586
because Malcolm Gladwell's
10,000 hour rule, and blah,


838
0:35:21,586 --> 0:35:21,77
blah, blah.


839
0:35:21,77 --> 0:35:23,5
Well, I just found out that
he didn't say that.


840
0:35:23,5 --> 0:35:24,61
He said, "Don't work.


841
0:35:24,61 --> 0:35:25,52
Worry."


842
0:35:25,52 --> 0:35:26,81
[LAUGHTER]


843
0:35:26,81 --> 0:35:27,29
GEORGE SAUNDERS: So
I don't know what


844
0:35:27,29 --> 0:35:30,44
the hell he was thinking.


845
0:35:30,44 --> 0:35:33,9
But I think what you'll find is
it's something that some of


846
0:35:33,9 --> 0:35:35,29
us want so desperately--


847
0:35:35,29 --> 0:35:37,7
to be good writers, I think
partly because it feels like


848
0:35:37,7 --> 0:35:39,82
consciousness.


849
0:35:39,82 --> 0:35:42,84
When you read a great writer,
you feel like you've been


850
0:35:42,84 --> 0:35:44,27
really seen.


851
0:35:44,27 --> 0:35:46,33
And you would love
to be the person


852
0:35:46,33 --> 0:35:47,85
who's giving that feeling.


853
0:35:47,85 --> 0:35:51,97
But because it's so hard, I
think it's got to be mystery.


854
0:35:51,97 --> 0:35:54,67
I do think that for an
individual writer, if you put


855
0:35:54,67 --> 0:35:57,91
the 10,000 hours in, you'll both
find out what your issues


856
0:35:57,91 --> 0:36:1,8
are, and you'll find really
weird, unique solutions that


857
0:36:1,8 --> 0:36:3,17
you never could have imagined
at the outset.


858
0:36:3,17 --> 0:36:6,74
But that process has almost
nothing to do with whether


859
0:36:6,74 --> 0:36:8,21
you'll ultimately
be published.


860
0:36:8,21 --> 0:36:11,97
So it's tricky.


861
0:36:11,97 --> 0:36:13,6
And you won't make any money.


862
0:36:13,6 --> 0:36:15,69
[LAUGHTER]


863
0:36:15,69 --> 0:36:19,2
AUDIENCE: So consuming art is
very personal process, so it's


864
0:36:19,2 --> 0:36:21,3
really hard to say that
someone was wrong


865
0:36:21,3 --> 0:36:21,71
when they did it.


866
0:36:21,71 --> 0:36:24,75
But in all your work, have you
ever witnessed someone


867
0:36:24,75 --> 0:36:27,11
observing something you wrote
and just interpreting it very


868
0:36:27,11 --> 0:36:29,16
surprisingly, or wrong?


869
0:36:29,16 --> 0:36:30,82
And how did that
make you feel?


870
0:36:30,82 --> 0:36:31,56
How did that go?


871
0:36:31,56 --> 0:36:32,39
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Yeah.


872
0:36:32,39 --> 0:36:34,1
When you said that, it brought
back one thing to mind.


873
0:36:34,1 --> 0:36:36,12
I had written a story called
"Winky" which is


874
0:36:36,12 --> 0:36:36,94
in the second book.


875
0:36:36,94 --> 0:36:39,88
And it's this story about this
guy who goes to a self help


876
0:36:39,88 --> 0:36:43,24
seminar, and it is the motto of
this thing is, "Don't let


877
0:36:43,24 --> 0:36:45,8
anybody crap in your oatmeal."


878
0:36:45,8 --> 0:36:49,55
And at home he's got this dim,
very religious sister who has


879
0:36:49,55 --> 0:36:51,98
been kicked out of her house,
and she's living with him.


880
0:36:51,98 --> 0:36:53,5
And he wants to get
rid of her.


881
0:36:53,5 --> 0:36:55,52
So he's thinking, I'm not going
to let her crap in my


882
0:36:55,52 --> 0:36:58,33
oatmeal, even though she's nice
and innocent and sweet


883
0:36:58,33 --> 0:37:0,94
and has nowhere else to go, I've
got to live into my own


884
0:37:0,94 --> 0:37:1,94
personal power.


885
0:37:1,94 --> 0:37:3,9
So it's obviously a tongue
in cheek thing.


886
0:37:3,9 --> 0:37:6,82
And in the story, he
goes home, he's


887
0:37:6,82 --> 0:37:7,91
resolved to kick her out.


888
0:37:7,91 --> 0:37:9,79
And when he sees
her, he can't.


889
0:37:9,79 --> 0:37:10,88
And he melts.


890
0:37:10,88 --> 0:37:13,52
But the kicker is that he feels
terrible that he's not a


891
0:37:13,52 --> 0:37:14,62
powerful enough person.


892
0:37:14,62 --> 0:37:15,68
So that's the story.


893
0:37:15,68 --> 0:37:17,93
So it came out in the "New
Yorker." And about a week


894
0:37:17,93 --> 0:37:18,86
later, I get this letter.


895
0:37:18,86 --> 0:37:21,11
And this guy says, my
name is so and so.


896
0:37:21,11 --> 0:37:24,97
I work with Charlton Heston
at the NRA, so I suspect


897
0:37:24,97 --> 0:37:26,22
politically we have
our differences.


898
0:37:26,22 --> 0:37:28,82



899
0:37:28,82 --> 0:37:31,8
But I loved your story.


900
0:37:31,8 --> 0:37:33,54
It helped me so much.


901
0:37:33,54 --> 0:37:35,28
This is a great example
of art crossing


902
0:37:35,28 --> 0:37:36,54
the left/right divide.


903
0:37:36,54 --> 0:37:38,94
And of course, I was
like, ye check off!


904
0:37:38,94 --> 0:37:41,17
See, I did it.


905
0:37:41,17 --> 0:37:43,84
And so of course, fishing for
further compliments, I said,


906
0:37:43,84 --> 0:37:46,5
oh thank you so much brother.


907
0:37:46,5 --> 0:37:50,11
Tell me a little more about
how I changed your life.


908
0:37:50,11 --> 0:37:53,44
And he said, well my mother
is in very good health.


909
0:37:53,44 --> 0:37:57,4
She's 72, and she had a very
mild stroke, which has caused


910
0:37:57,4 --> 0:37:58,13
me some inconvenience.


911
0:37:58,13 --> 0:38:1,163
And your story convinced me
to put her in a rest home.


912
0:38:1,163 --> 0:38:4,62
[LAUGHTER]


913
0:38:4,62 --> 0:38:7,44
And I was like, what?


914
0:38:7,44 --> 0:38:8,99
And I wrote him back
this long thing.


915
0:38:8,99 --> 0:38:10,33
No sir, please, you've
misunderstood.


916
0:38:10,33 --> 0:38:12,84
And I gave him the whole
exogesis of the thing.


917
0:38:12,84 --> 0:38:15,17
And he's like, that's cool,
have a good day.


918
0:38:15,17 --> 0:38:16,58
That was that.


919
0:38:16,58 --> 0:38:19,26
So yeah, I think once you put
something out there, there is


920
0:38:19,26 --> 0:38:21,77
no freaking telling what
someone's going


921
0:38:21,77 --> 0:38:23,28
to read into it.


922
0:38:23,28 --> 0:38:24,42
But what I've noticed is,


923
0:38:24,42 --> 0:38:26,79
statistically, most people don't.


924
0:38:26,79 --> 0:38:27,85
And that guy was looking.


925
0:38:27,85 --> 0:38:30,4
I mean, he could have gotten
that excuse from a Starbucks


926
0:38:30,4 --> 0:38:32,55
cup, reading the coffee
grounds or something.


927
0:38:32,55 --> 0:38:35,72
But I think you have to assume
that-- and it's interesting to


928
0:38:35,72 --> 0:38:38,155
do a tour, and this book is
actually selling, so I'm


929
0:38:38,155 --> 0:38:38,95
meeting a lot of people.


930
0:38:38,95 --> 0:38:42,83
And it's amazing how many good
hearted, good readers there


931
0:38:42,83 --> 0:38:44,36
are who do get more--


932
0:38:44,36 --> 0:38:46,73
get what you put in it
and then even more.


933
0:38:46,73 --> 0:38:48,61
So mostly not-- that was
the one example I can


934
0:38:48,61 --> 0:38:50,454
really think of.


935
0:38:50,454 --> 0:38:53,85
AUDIENCE: Also because of that
story, I say crapping in my


936
0:38:53,85 --> 0:38:55,5
oatmeal, and no one knows
what I'm talking about.


937
0:38:55,5 --> 0:38:56,43
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Yeah.


938
0:38:56,43 --> 0:38:56,61
See?


939
0:38:56,61 --> 0:38:59,4
So there was a good outcome
too, so it's a balance.


940
0:38:59,4 --> 0:38:59,75
Thank you.


941
0:38:59,75 --> 0:39:1,5
Thanks for the question.


942
0:39:1,5 --> 0:39:3,7
AUDIENCE: So I just wanted
to address something.


943
0:39:3,7 --> 0:39:7,32
One of the reasons why your
stories grab me is that they


944
0:39:7,32 --> 0:39:9,21
seem so honest.


945
0:39:9,21 --> 0:39:14,16
And I think I read a reviewer
that said something about how


946
0:39:14,16 --> 0:39:16,74
you can come closer to truth
in fiction sometimes


947
0:39:16,74 --> 0:39:17,9
than in real life.


948
0:39:17,9 --> 0:39:21,72
So I wanted to ask you, how do
you as you're writing try and


949
0:39:21,72 --> 0:39:23,72
sidle up to truth
through fiction?


950
0:39:23,72 --> 0:39:24,46
GEORGE SAUNDERS: That's
a great question.


951
0:39:24,46 --> 0:39:27,29
And I think the answer is
a phrase at a time.


952
0:39:27,29 --> 0:39:30,97
Because if I think about what do
I think is true, or if you


953
0:39:30,97 --> 0:39:32,32
think, what's true?


954
0:39:32,32 --> 0:39:34,4
We have some answers.


955
0:39:34,4 --> 0:39:35,61
But mine are a little rickety.


956
0:39:35,61 --> 0:39:38,46
They're a little conceptual,
they're a little political.


957
0:39:38,46 --> 0:39:41,37
So what I love about fiction is
if you start with anything


958
0:39:41,37 --> 0:39:45,7
really, any prejudice or
whatever, through this


959
0:39:45,7 --> 0:39:49,99
iterative process of trying to
get your prose not to be a


960
0:39:49,99 --> 0:39:54,11
buzz kill, basically, then
weirdly you'll gradually move


961
0:39:54,11 --> 0:39:56,87
towards truth and specificity.


962
0:39:56,87 --> 0:39:59,87
So if you say, Bob was ugly--


963
0:39:59,87 --> 0:40:1,56
back to Bob again--


964
0:40:1,56 --> 0:40:1,79
Bob was ugly.


965
0:40:1,79 --> 0:40:4,6
Well, if you're a trained
reader, that sentence leaves


966
0:40:4,6 --> 0:40:6,66
you a little, eh.


967
0:40:6,66 --> 0:40:8,97
You're waiting for
detail, right?


968
0:40:8,97 --> 0:40:11,41
So then if you write
that on Tuesday.


969
0:40:11,41 --> 0:40:13,79
Wednesday you come back and
say that's vague, let


970
0:40:13,79 --> 0:40:16,0
me flesh that out.


971
0:40:16,0 --> 0:40:18,5
Bob wore an ugly sweater.


972
0:40:18,5 --> 0:40:20,61
OK, now suddenly we're talking
about a guy with bad taste.


973
0:40:20,61 --> 0:40:22,33
It's changed a little bit--


974
0:40:22,33 --> 0:40:24,5
still not very specific.


975
0:40:24,5 --> 0:40:28,85
Bob wore a stained red sweater
with the torn blue pocket and


976
0:40:28,85 --> 0:40:31,38
a reindeer on the abdomen.


977
0:40:31,38 --> 0:40:33,92
Well, that's a better
sense already.


978
0:40:33,92 --> 0:40:36,72
And suddenly now it's
about Bob is now


979
0:40:36,72 --> 0:40:39,31
a little bit slovenly--


980
0:40:39,31 --> 0:40:41,2
almost belligerently slovenly.


981
0:40:41,2 --> 0:40:43,57
And that's interesting,
suddenly.


982
0:40:43,57 --> 0:40:45,95
And then it produces plot too.


983
0:40:45,95 --> 0:40:47,82
Because having established
that Blob--


984
0:40:47,82 --> 0:40:48,32
Blob?


985
0:40:48,32 --> 0:40:50,11
[LAUGHTER]


986
0:40:50,11 --> 0:40:51,52
GEORGE SAUNDERS: I'm
editing right now.


987
0:40:51,52 --> 0:40:53,48
So having established that
Blob is belligerently


988
0:40:53,48 --> 0:40:57,66
slothful, then we know what
might have to happen to him.


989
0:40:57,66 --> 0:40:59,44
So in the bad Hollywood
version, he meets an


990
0:40:59,44 --> 0:41:4,17
incredibly neat girl, played
by Angelina Jolie.


991
0:41:4,17 --> 0:41:8,78
So I think if you take the thing
a phrase at a time, that


992
0:41:8,78 --> 0:41:13,81
boat will mysteriously move
towards truth, and also it'll


993
0:41:13,81 --> 0:41:15,44
move you to a place
of empathy.


994
0:41:15,44 --> 0:41:19,78
When we live in New York,
upstate, I used to wait for a


995
0:41:19,78 --> 0:41:22,3
bus across from this
barbershop.


996
0:41:22,3 --> 0:41:24,0
And there was this middle aged
barber who came out--


997
0:41:24,0 --> 0:41:25,69
a pear shaped guy-- and
he'd come out with a


998
0:41:25,69 --> 0:41:26,9
cigarette and a coffee.


999
0:41:26,9 --> 0:41:31,53
And every time a woman walked
by, he would just go, zoom.


1000
0:41:31,53 --> 0:41:33,41
And even when she busted him,
he'd just keep looking.


1001
0:41:33,41 --> 0:41:37,3
And we just had our daughters,
so I was like a new feminist.


1002
0:41:37,3 --> 0:41:39,102
And I noticed this guy.


1003
0:41:39,102 --> 0:41:40,7
And I thought, I am going
to nail that guy.


1004
0:41:40,7 --> 0:41:42,92
I am going to write a story
and just make fun of him.


1005
0:41:42,92 --> 0:41:45,4
So I started, and it was
really enjoyable--


1006
0:41:45,4 --> 0:41:46,6
this guy with this
thought stream


1007
0:41:46,6 --> 0:41:49,72
that's always perverted.


1008
0:41:49,72 --> 0:41:52,9
And then about a year into that,
the story just died.


1009
0:41:52,9 --> 0:41:54,29
I couldn't get it to go
past the middle part.


1010
0:41:54,29 --> 0:41:54,87
It was fun.


1011
0:41:54,87 --> 0:41:58,22
It very funny.


1012
0:41:58,22 --> 0:42:0,54
And it finally occurred to me,
the reason I couldn't get it


1013
0:42:0,54 --> 0:42:4,64
to move is because I was so
intent on kicking him, that I


1014
0:42:4,64 --> 0:42:6,36
wasn't giving him any
hope of getting


1015
0:42:6,36 --> 0:42:7,57
out of that low position.


1016
0:42:7,57 --> 0:42:9,67
And that's not a story.


1017
0:42:9,67 --> 0:42:12,32
There has to be at
least a trace--


1018
0:42:12,32 --> 0:42:14,63
the hope that the person could
transcend himself.


1019
0:42:14,63 --> 0:42:17,24
So as soon as I did that, I
thought I've got to make this


1020
0:42:17,24 --> 0:42:18,3
guy more sympathetic.


1021
0:42:18,3 --> 0:42:21,547
Now because I'm not that
subtle, I wrote in


1022
0:42:21,547 --> 0:42:22,9
that he had no toes.


1023
0:42:22,9 --> 0:42:27,21
So that was my subtle Chekovian
move there.


1024
0:42:27,21 --> 0:42:30,7
But I did it, because suddenly
here's a guy who now he's


1025
0:42:30,7 --> 0:42:34,27
still a sexist, and he's
very defensive, and he


1026
0:42:34,27 --> 0:42:36,37
doesn't have any toes.


1027
0:42:36,37 --> 0:42:40,11
So suddenly, oh, poor
guy, and so then the


1028
0:42:40,11 --> 0:42:41,44
story could move ahead.


1029
0:42:41,44 --> 0:42:43,75
So I think that's where the
honesty and everything comes


1030
0:42:43,75 --> 0:42:46,22
from just line by line
immersion in


1031
0:42:46,22 --> 0:42:47,12
the thing, I think.


1032
0:42:47,12 --> 0:42:51,9
Yeah, but the funny thing about
that, because that story


1033
0:42:51,9 --> 0:42:53,16
come out in the "New Yorker."
And by that time, I'd spent


1034
0:42:53,16 --> 0:42:54,8
about three years with
this projection of


1035
0:42:54,8 --> 0:42:55,87
this guy in my mind.


1036
0:42:55,87 --> 0:42:57,94
So we happened to
be in that town.


1037
0:42:57,94 --> 0:42:59,81
And I'm walking down the street
with my wife and my two


1038
0:42:59,81 --> 0:43:1,97
daughters, and lo and behold
this guy steps


1039
0:43:1,97 --> 0:43:3,24
out onto the sidewalk.


1040
0:43:3,24 --> 0:43:6,4
And I thought, George,
you bastard.


1041
0:43:6,4 --> 0:43:8,88
You just mocked this guy in the
"New Yorker." You don't


1042
0:43:8,88 --> 0:43:9,58
know who he is.


1043
0:43:9,58 --> 0:43:11,78
He could be a million
[INAUDIBLE]


1044
0:43:11,78 --> 0:43:13,16
the tyranny of fiction.


1045
0:43:13,16 --> 0:43:15,95
But as we walked by, he looked
at my wife and my daughters


1046
0:43:15,95 --> 0:43:17,67
and he goes, ladies.


1047
0:43:17,67 --> 0:43:19,263
Like that, and I thought, wow!


1048
0:43:19,263 --> 0:43:21,235
[LAUGTHER]


1049
0:43:21,235 --> 0:43:23,125
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Yeah, score!


1050
0:43:23,125 --> 0:43:26,59



1051
0:43:26,59 --> 0:43:27,98
AUDIENCE: I'm wondering if you'd
talk a little bit about


1052
0:43:27,98 --> 0:43:31,6
how your process is the same
and/or different when working


1053
0:43:31,6 --> 0:43:32,47
on nonfiction rather
than fiction.


1054
0:43:32,47 --> 0:43:33,47
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Sure.


1055
0:43:33,47 --> 0:43:36,25
Yeah, I did a series of
nonfiction pieces for "GQ,"


1056
0:43:36,25 --> 0:43:38,19
mostly travel based pieces.


1057
0:43:38,19 --> 0:43:42,9
And those were such a relief,
because in fiction, as I've


1058
0:43:42,9 --> 0:43:46,32
said, I'm doing a lot of
rewriting to generate plot, to


1059
0:43:46,32 --> 0:43:48,47
say, well what's the next thing
that should happen, that


1060
0:43:48,47 --> 0:43:49,64
could happen, that's
meaningful.


1061
0:43:49,64 --> 0:43:52,19
And for some reason, that
takes me a lot of hours.


1062
0:43:52,19 --> 0:43:55,925
So with the nonfiction, you come
home from a week and you


1063
0:43:55,925 --> 0:43:58,69
know there are 10 things
that happened.


1064
0:43:58,69 --> 0:44:0,86
So then the process is just
trying to write those 10 and


1065
0:44:0,86 --> 0:44:2,89
see which one of them
comes to life.


1066
0:44:2,89 --> 0:44:6,6
And then once, say six of them
do, four of them don't, then


1067
0:44:6,6 --> 0:44:7,46
you just do a calculation.


1068
0:44:7,46 --> 0:44:10,41
I've got 12,000 words, I
can take this one up,


1069
0:44:10,41 --> 0:44:10,75
turn this one down.


1070
0:44:10,75 --> 0:44:12,495
So it's a little more like
engineering work--


1071
0:44:12,495 --> 0:44:15,72
you're cutting to fit.


1072
0:44:15,72 --> 0:44:18,79
And then the meaning of the
story, and the theme, come out


1073
0:44:18,79 --> 0:44:21,92
of which elements have risen to
the occasion a little bit.


1074
0:44:21,92 --> 0:44:23,73
So that tends to be faster.


1075
0:44:23,73 --> 0:44:27,14
Your main job is to make
whatever you do charming on a


1076
0:44:27,14 --> 0:44:28,6
sentence to sentence level.


1077
0:44:28,6 --> 0:44:29,62
But the events are
given to you.


1078
0:44:29,62 --> 0:44:33,42
So that's really a nice palate
cleanser in a way.


1079
0:44:33,42 --> 0:44:37,21
AUDIENCE: I think I read in an
interview with your editor


1080
0:44:37,21 --> 0:44:40,18
saying that with nonfiction
you tended to give extra


1081
0:44:40,18 --> 0:44:41,73
material to the editor.


1082
0:44:41,73 --> 0:44:41,98
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Yeah.


1083
0:44:41,98 --> 0:44:43,52
AUDIENCE: How does that
process work?


1084
0:44:43,52 --> 0:44:46,76
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Well,
basically, at "GQ" I always


1085
0:44:46,76 --> 0:44:48,71
had a week long trip
and 12,000 words.


1086
0:44:48,71 --> 0:44:50,85
So you'd get those three
or four bits.


1087
0:44:50,85 --> 0:44:53,57
You're like I can't believe
that's not going in there.


1088
0:44:53,57 --> 0:44:58,41
And you have a point in time
vision of your 12,000 words,


1089
0:44:58,41 --> 0:45:1,21
but this part over here
still feels red hot.


1090
0:45:1,21 --> 0:45:5,8
So in that setting, you had the
liberty of saying what do


1091
0:45:5,8 --> 0:45:6,66
you think, should I try
to fit this in?


1092
0:45:6,66 --> 0:45:8,78
And my editor, Andy Ward,
is just a great


1093
0:45:8,78 --> 0:45:9,6
friend and a great guy.


1094
0:45:9,6 --> 0:45:13,34
And he can just say, no, no,
no, yes, put that one in.


1095
0:45:13,34 --> 0:45:15,1
And once he's said that, then
it becomes really like a


1096
0:45:15,1 --> 0:45:15,8
Rubik's cube.


1097
0:45:15,8 --> 0:45:18,67
Where does it go, what do I have
to give up to get that


1098
0:45:18,67 --> 0:45:19,37
back, and so on?


1099
0:45:19,37 --> 0:45:22,51
But just to have a second set
of eyes saying, actually no,


1100
0:45:22,51 --> 0:45:25,42
you've got that, that one's not
so good, I think there's


1101
0:45:25,42 --> 0:45:29,59
heat in that third
one, put it in.


1102
0:45:29,59 --> 0:45:32,69
AUDIENCE: My question is about
how your world view influences


1103
0:45:32,69 --> 0:45:34,36
your writing.


1104
0:45:34,36 --> 0:45:37,71
In many of your interviews,
you've talked about when you


1105
0:45:37,71 --> 0:45:40,29
started off and you were working
as an engineer, you


1106
0:45:40,29 --> 0:45:43,68
had the sense that things could
go drastically wrong in


1107
0:45:43,68 --> 0:45:48,7
your life at any point, how
it was very fragile.


1108
0:45:48,7 --> 0:45:49,4
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Right.


1109
0:45:49,4 --> 0:45:52,2
AUDIENCE: And that world view
seems to be reflected in


1110
0:45:52,2 --> 0:45:57,895
stories like "CivilWarLand." And
now you're famous, you're


1111
0:45:57,895 --> 0:46:1,45
well-to-do, and your books have
even started selling.


1112
0:46:1,45 --> 0:46:4,3
I'm wondering how your world
view has changed, and whether


1113
0:46:4,3 --> 0:46:7,72
that change affects how you
write and approach fiction?


1114
0:46:7,72 --> 0:46:8,83
GEORGE SAUNDERS: That's a
great question, yeah.


1115
0:46:8,83 --> 0:46:14,0
For me, when we were young, a
writer is like the canary in a


1116
0:46:14,0 --> 0:46:18,8
coal mine in that we were
never in the gulag.


1117
0:46:18,8 --> 0:46:20,61
We were way over extended
on credit


1118
0:46:20,61 --> 0:46:23,0
cards, but not starving.


1119
0:46:23,0 --> 0:46:27,7
But I found that just that
little whiff of fear that you


1120
0:46:27,7 --> 0:46:29,93
have when you have small
kids and you're


1121
0:46:29,93 --> 0:46:31,92
not a powerful person--


1122
0:46:31,92 --> 0:46:33,882
that was enough to really--


1123
0:46:33,882 --> 0:46:35,83
you know that great Terry
Eagleton quote about


1124
0:46:35,83 --> 0:46:39,695
"Capitalism plunders the
sensuality of the body." So I


1125
0:46:39,695 --> 0:46:40,38
could feel that.


1126
0:46:40,38 --> 0:46:43,29
And so I got those first
two books out of that.


1127
0:46:43,29 --> 0:46:45,49
Now why that was a revelation,
I'm not quite sure.


1128
0:46:45,49 --> 0:46:47,8
I should have known that.


1129
0:46:47,8 --> 0:46:51,36
So now it's later, and our kids
are wonderful and grown.


1130
0:46:51,36 --> 0:46:55,85
And so the one thing I notice,
my desire, what I want to


1131
0:46:55,85 --> 0:46:59,4
accomplish before die is to try
to make a fictional scale


1132
0:46:59,4 --> 0:47:3,182
model of the world in which the
positive and the negative,


1133
0:47:3,182 --> 0:47:8,67
the hopeful and the not are
there in a compelling mix.


1134
0:47:8,67 --> 0:47:11,57
And I noticed it --


1135
0:47:11,57 --> 0:47:15,75
when you look at my earlier
work, it's very good at


1136
0:47:15,75 --> 0:47:20,18
showing the potential
for chaos.


1137
0:47:20,18 --> 0:47:22,78
And I just want to try to get
some of the positive valence


1138
0:47:22,78 --> 0:47:24,71
in there, in a way that's
not cheesy, that's not


1139
0:47:24,71 --> 0:47:25,91
sentimental or corny.


1140
0:47:25,91 --> 0:47:28,21
But I think any of us who live
in America in this time,


1141
0:47:28,21 --> 0:47:30,48
you've got to love it.


1142
0:47:30,48 --> 0:47:32,19
We're very fortunate.


1143
0:47:32,19 --> 0:47:35,3
Or forget America, you walk
through a field of grass on a


1144
0:47:35,3 --> 0:47:37,37
summer day and they
just cut it--


1145
0:47:37,37 --> 0:47:38,69
pretty good.


1146
0:47:38,69 --> 0:47:43,2
So for some reason, fiction
skews dark.


1147
0:47:43,2 --> 0:47:44,92
Some would say happiness
writes white.


1148
0:47:44,92 --> 0:47:47,7
So technically, I think it's
harder to get the positive


1149
0:47:47,7 --> 0:47:47,6
valences in.


1150
0:47:47,6 --> 0:47:52,52
And that's my mission, but
again, without becoming Mr.


1151
0:47:52,52 --> 0:47:53,84
Positive Thinker--


1152
0:47:53,84 --> 0:47:55,8
the guy who gets a spike through
his head and says what


1153
0:47:55,8 --> 0:47:58,66
a great opportunity.


1154
0:47:58,66 --> 0:47:59,94
And I think the great
writers do it.


1155
0:47:59,94 --> 0:48:3,36
Tolstoy did it, Shakespeare did
it, Virginia Woolf did it,


1156
0:48:3,36 --> 0:48:4,53
Alice Munro does it.


1157
0:48:4,53 --> 0:48:8,42
And so that's my personal
mission.


1158
0:48:8,42 --> 0:48:9,93
AUDIENCE: Just a quick follow
up question on that.


1159
0:48:9,93 --> 0:48:14,31
I think that you are driving
at what was in my mind too.


1160
0:48:14,31 --> 0:48:17,78
Why does fiction tend
to be darker?


1161
0:48:17,78 --> 0:48:18,58
GEORGE SAUNDERS: That's
a great question.


1162
0:48:18,58 --> 0:48:20,96
AUDIENCE: Why is it so difficult
to capture the


1163
0:48:20,96 --> 0:48:23,99
beautiful and positive
moments in our lives?


1164
0:48:23,99 --> 0:48:26,51
GEORGE SAUNDERS: I think one
answer is just the Little Red


1165
0:48:26,51 --> 0:48:29,43
Riding Hood syndrome, which is
if I say once upon a time,


1166
0:48:29,43 --> 0:48:31,39
there was a girl named Little
Red Riding Hood.


1167
0:48:31,39 --> 0:48:33,56
Her mother told her, don't
talk to the wolf,


1168
0:48:33,56 --> 0:48:34,85
and then she didn't.


1169
0:48:34,85 --> 0:48:38,2
[LAUGTHER]


1170
0:48:38,2 --> 0:48:39,39
GEORGE SAUNDERS: So
I think it's just


1171
0:48:39,39 --> 0:48:40,73
something about maybe--


1172
0:48:40,73 --> 0:48:43,11
here, I'm just guessing--
but maybe at some level,


1173
0:48:43,11 --> 0:48:47,995
storytelling is cautionary
in its design.


1174
0:48:47,995 --> 0:48:51,32
And I think that even in the
Bible, these things don't


1175
0:48:51,32 --> 0:48:53,62
often come out well.


1176
0:48:53,62 --> 0:48:55,87
But in the Bible, they do--


1177
0:48:55,87 --> 0:48:57,32
the Resurrection is the big--


1178
0:48:57,32 --> 0:48:58,76
so I think it's possible.


1179
0:48:58,76 --> 0:49:0,95
But for some reason, certainly
at the beginning levels,


1180
0:49:0,95 --> 0:49:4,85
smirking is so easy, to make
fun of something is easy.


1181
0:49:4,85 --> 0:49:6,9
And when we get our
applications, it's funny.


1182
0:49:6,9 --> 0:49:9,85
Because every year, you're
reading young writers.


1183
0:49:9,85 --> 0:49:13,99
And so for example, it turns
out that in that fictive


1184
0:49:13,99 --> 0:49:18,1
country, everybody over
35 is a pedophile--


1185
0:49:18,1 --> 0:49:19,87
everybody.


1186
0:49:19,87 --> 0:49:25,6
And every person, for example,
any midget is a


1187
0:49:25,6 --> 0:49:27,79
genius, is a sage.


1188
0:49:27,79 --> 0:49:30,76
Those are the only ones
who ever show up.


1189
0:49:30,76 --> 0:49:32,97
There's tropes that
you get into--


1190
0:49:32,97 --> 0:49:36,24
every stepfather is a terrible
monster, who only reveals


1191
0:49:36,24 --> 0:49:37,5
himself on page 12.


1192
0:49:37,5 --> 0:49:39,46
So that's not true.


1193
0:49:39,46 --> 0:49:41,8
It's just a pattern
of imagination.


1194
0:49:41,8 --> 0:49:43,58
So I don't really know
why that is.


1195
0:49:43,58 --> 0:49:45,68
But I know for sure, from
experience, it's harder to get


1196
0:49:45,68 --> 0:49:47,702
into those high registers.


1197
0:49:47,702 --> 0:49:49,59
AUDIENCE: Hello.


1198
0:49:49,59 --> 0:49:54,46
I want to ask you about
Hemingway's influence on you.


1199
0:49:54,46 --> 0:49:56,8
I was listening yesterday
at the forum.


1200
0:49:56,8 --> 0:49:59,88
You spoke about how you tried
to imitate him or


1201
0:49:59,88 --> 0:50:0,88
work a lot like him.


1202
0:50:0,88 --> 0:50:3,44
And it was frustrating
at the end.


1203
0:50:3,44 --> 0:50:7,29
And earlier, you spoke
about how you make


1204
0:50:7,29 --> 0:50:9,25
something sound true.


1205
0:50:9,25 --> 0:50:13,0
And I think Hemingway, in one
of his books when he was in


1206
0:50:13,0 --> 0:50:16,49
Paris, I think he tells that
he tries to write something


1207
0:50:16,49 --> 0:50:18,72
that sounds the truest.


1208
0:50:18,72 --> 0:50:21,2
That's a technique,
I think, for him.


1209
0:50:21,2 --> 0:50:23,66
If it sounds true, then
it's good enough.


1210
0:50:23,66 --> 0:50:24,11
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Right.


1211
0:50:24,11 --> 0:50:27,79
AUDIENCE: And so my question is,
are there things that you


1212
0:50:27,79 --> 0:50:31,71
learn from Hemingway that you
use in your writings, like


1213
0:50:31,71 --> 0:50:34,83
this one or other things that
you can talk about?


1214
0:50:34,83 --> 0:50:36,7
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Yeah,
Hemingway was a huge


1215
0:50:36,7 --> 0:50:39,38
influence, as he is, I think,
on a lot of writers.


1216
0:50:39,38 --> 0:50:42,67
And at some point, you get to
that critical point where your


1217
0:50:42,67 --> 0:50:47,47
worldview and your hero's
diction just don't close.


1218
0:50:47,47 --> 0:50:50,66
So I was living in Amarillo,
Texas and trying to be


1219
0:50:50,66 --> 0:50:51,62
Hemingway too.


1220
0:50:51,62 --> 0:50:55,62
And so you'd go like, Nick
walked into the Walmart .


1221
0:50:55,62 --> 0:50:56,88
It was pleasant.


1222
0:50:56,88 --> 0:50:57,95
[LAUGHTER]


1223
0:50:57,95 --> 0:50:59,53
GEORGE SAUNDERS: But there's,
for a young writer, that


1224
0:50:59,53 --> 0:51:3,6
wonderful moment where you go I
know things in my gut that I


1225
0:51:3,6 --> 0:51:5,94
can't say in that diction, now
matter if you're imitating


1226
0:51:5,94 --> 0:51:7,22
Kerouac or whoever it is.


1227
0:51:7,22 --> 0:51:11,1
So that is a holy moment for a
young writer, when you start


1228
0:51:11,1 --> 0:51:14,3
getting full body impatient
with your mentor.


1229
0:51:14,3 --> 0:51:18,36
But I did, from him, I think,
just minimalism--


1230
0:51:18,36 --> 0:51:20,55
just cutting, cutting, cutting,
cutting, making sure


1231
0:51:20,55 --> 0:51:26,41
that as much as you can help it,
you're not on auto pilot.


1232
0:51:26,41 --> 0:51:28,246
It was a dark and cloudy day.


1233
0:51:28,246 --> 0:51:29,24
Ugh.


1234
0:51:29,24 --> 0:51:30,58
Really?


1235
0:51:30,58 --> 0:51:33,23
So to just lean into the
sentence the way he did.


1236
0:51:33,23 --> 0:51:35,39
And make sure that the sentence
is not only a


1237
0:51:35,39 --> 0:51:38,12
sentence but it actually can
become a thing in the world


1238
0:51:38,12 --> 0:51:39,955
itself in a certain way.


1239
0:51:39,955 --> 0:51:41,53
AUDIENCE: Do you think
that this style it


1240
0:51:41,53 --> 0:51:42,74
represents his time?


1241
0:51:42,74 --> 0:51:45,86
It's not something you
can use anymore?


1242
0:51:45,86 --> 0:51:47,3
Because [INAUDIBLE]


1243
0:51:47,3 --> 0:51:50,14
a certain figure of people
[INAUDIBLE].


1244
0:51:50,14 --> 0:51:52,62
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Yeah, for me,
what I got tired of in


1245
0:51:52,62 --> 0:51:55,35
Hemingway was that he, in his
later work especially, he


1246
0:51:55,35 --> 0:51:56,1
wasn't funny.


1247
0:51:56,1 --> 0:51:58,2
He didn't have any sense
of humor actually.


1248
0:51:58,2 --> 0:52:0,69
He knew very well who the
noble, interesting


1249
0:52:0,69 --> 0:52:2,55
people were and so on.


1250
0:52:2,55 --> 0:52:4,65
And my life was not--


1251
0:52:4,65 --> 0:52:7,24
I never lived a Hemingwayesque
moment really.


1252
0:52:7,24 --> 0:52:12,12
I remember as a young kid coming
out of a funeral-- a


1253
0:52:12,12 --> 0:52:16,11
very sad, terrible thing.


1254
0:52:16,11 --> 0:52:19,44
But the funeral was being held
in a mock Georgian mansion--


1255
0:52:19,44 --> 0:52:21,58
one of those mansions that had
been put up just to be a


1256
0:52:21,58 --> 0:52:22,65
funeral parlor.


1257
0:52:22,65 --> 0:52:24,36
And then you walk out of
that, and everyone's


1258
0:52:24,36 --> 0:52:25,65
crying and it's terrible.


1259
0:52:25,65 --> 0:52:28,22
And across the street, there's
a Chuck E Cheese.


1260
0:52:28,22 --> 0:52:30,15
And the mouse is on break.


1261
0:52:30,15 --> 0:52:32,21
And he's on the side of the
building with his head off.


1262
0:52:32,21 --> 0:52:34,22
And he's smoking.


1263
0:52:34,22 --> 0:52:36,37
So that moment could not
show up in Hemingway.


1264
0:52:36,37 --> 0:52:37,88
He couldn't do it.


1265
0:52:37,88 --> 0:52:41,21
He had a stylistic cave he
had made for himself.


1266
0:52:41,21 --> 0:52:44,68
And I thought, that's where
the gateway to style is.


1267
0:52:44,68 --> 0:52:46,62
And when you see something in
your life, in your heart, in


1268
0:52:46,62 --> 0:52:50,34
your world that the style of
your hero can't accommodate,


1269
0:52:50,34 --> 0:52:53,3
then it's a time for growth.


1270
0:52:53,3 --> 0:52:53,75
MALE SPEAKER: I'm afraid
we're out of time.


1271
0:52:53,75 --> 0:52:56,13
But I just want to say
thank you for coming.


1272
0:52:56,13 --> 0:52:57,19
GEORGE SAUNDERS: Thank
you very much--


1273
0:52:57,19 --> 0:52:58,9
appreciate it.


1274
0:52:58,9 --> 0:54:58,9
[APPLAUSE]
