###5 VALERIE VARGAS: We are around here.
###8 STEWART ROBSON: We're where the big, red circle is.
###10 VALERIE VARGAS: We're in the big, red circle.
###12 Did you see the kangaroos in there?
###14 And the wallabies?
###15 
###20 STEWART ROBSON: Hello.
###21 VALERIE VARGAS: How cool is he?
###23 STEWART ROBSON: You want to go on the slides?
###25 You know you do.
###27 
###32 VALERIE VARGAS: Can you imagine getting a hug from one
###34 of them, how awesome that would feel?
###37 It would wrap around your whole entire body.
###41 MALE SPEAKER:
###45 STEWART ROBSON: I can't really remember, to be honest.
###47 She'd probably need to jog my memory.
###49 MALE SPEAKER:
###52 STEWART ROBSON: Oh yeah.
###54 We were working together then.
###56 We were friends, and we were whatever.
###57 And she was blind drunk.
###62 Horrendous.
###62 I remember telling her, if you were a man, I'd knock you out.
###65 Because she's a mean drunk, really horrible.
###71 And then, well why are you being an asshole?
###73 And her answer was, I fucking love you.
###78 A few months later, we were together.
###79 
###95 VALERIE VARGAS: The lion's voice is the deepest and
###97 loudest of all cats.
###98 How low is your voice compared to a lion's roar?
###100 Pop your head through the hole and growl as low as you can.
###104 Go on.
###106 STEWART ROBSON: I'm not going to roar.
###107 VALERIE VARGAS: Go on.
###108 STEWART ROBSON: Ahh.
###110 VALERIE VARGAS: We were friends just before he started
###113 to be serious about wanting to tattoo, and before he actually
###116 started tattooing.
###117 By then we were talking every other day swapping stories
###122 about what's going on with me.
###124 And I really liked his work online.
###126 He had a couple of websites with some of his work.
###129 And it was like, hey, would you mind just doing a little
###131 black tattoo?
###131 And he did it.
###132 And we just stayed in touch.
###134 So it was a lovely journey, friendship wise.
###137 And then when we got together it felt like, right, this is
###140 where it really begins now.
###141 
###144 STEWART ROBSON: I absolutely love the head, the tail--
###146 
###149 yeah.
###150 VALERIE VARGAS: [INAUDIBLE]
###151 STEWART ROBSON: Yeah, absolutely.
###152 Every element about it is just more the position of where
###155 he's off to.
###157 VALERIE VARGAS: Well let me draw it first.
###158 And then I'll let you have a look.
###160 
###164 STEWART ROBSON:
###166 VALERIE VARGAS: He doesn't like the claws, the way the
###167 angle of them goes.
###168 STEWART ROBSON:
###180 VALERIE VARGAS: He's always been very good at doing that,
###182 telling me why something is wrong, not just telling me
###185 it's wrong or why does that look like shit, you know.
###188 STEWART ROBSON: That's how we ended up
###189 getting together, really.
###189 Because it worked really well.
###193 She helps me with drawings, I help her with drawings.
###195 And she went, why is that tiger you drew cross-eyed?
###198 And I'm like, I didn't fucking notice it's cross-eyed.
###200 And so we can help each other.
###202 Maybe I focus more on composition and flow, and she
###205 focuses more on detail.
###206 And Valerie can characterize a mood and a feeling and a
###211 character in a tattoo.
###213 And a lot of people don't make a character.
###215 They either make it angry or sad or whatever, but there's
###218 no character there.
###220 She's known for faces.
###221 But she also does a characterization with eagle,
###225 snakes, and narrowing an eye, and maybe a larger pupil or a
###228 smaller pupil.
###229 And she understands that stuff.
###232 VALERIE VARGAS: I'm just so happy that I like his work, he
###235 likes my work, which means that we have mutual respect.
###238 I've said to him before, kind of jokingly, if you sucked I
###241 wouldn't have half as much fun in this relationship
###243 as I do, you know?
###244 It's really cool to watch over his shoulder and just be like,
###247 how did you do that?
###248 That's amazing.
###249 And I love it.
###252 STEWART ROBSON: I don't think either of our work would be as
###255 accomplished without each other.
###257 All right, Dragon Man.
###258 VALERIE VARGAS (OFFSCREEN): The Dragon Man.
###259 STEWART ROBSON:
###262 VALERIE VARGAS (OFFSCREEN): Shut the fuck up.
###264 It doesn't need a wave at all.
###266 STEWART ROBSON: It says, [INAUDIBLE] in
###266 the water above it.
###267 VALERIE VARGAS (OFFSCREEN): Ugh.
###268 Shut up.
###270 You're just making my life harder.
###271 MALE SPEAKER: You're not a fan of waves?
###273 VALERIE VARGAS: I can't draw water to save my life.
###277 I'm generally quite a grumpy sod, to be honest.
###279 You know, I don't know if it comes through or what.
###280 But I think the more I hang out with people the more they
###284 see it, definitely.
###285 STEWART ROBSON:
###288 VALERIE VARGAS (OFFSCREEN): Where?
###289 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Where?
###289 VALERIE VARGAS (OFFSCREEN): If you're going to say here, I
###292 don't want it there.
###292 STEWART ROBSON: No, no, because that'll take up space.
###294 You need a cloud in here.
###297 VALERIE VARGAS: Really?
###297 STEWART ROBSON (OFFSCREEN): Yeah, in that little bit.
###299 Because that's just an empty hollow there.
###301 That's all.
###304 
###307 VALERIE VARGAS (OFFSCREEN): No, I'm not
###308 gonna do a cloud there.
###310 VALERIE VARGAS (OFFSCREEN): See, Stewart?
###312 STEWART ROBSON (OFFSCREEN):
###319 DANTE DIMASSA: We all say that Stewart's under the thumb.
###322 You know, I'm married, I have a child, and the one who wears
###325 the pants in my house is my wife.
###328 It might not look like that, but that's how a man's life--
###330 not a man's life.
###332 You know, when you get married you sign up for that.
###335 That's how it is.
###335 So it's all right.
###337 And Stewart knows that.
###338 Stewart knows how to handle Valerie.
###340 STEFANO C: I mean, I know many couples
###344 that are both tattooers.
###345 So there's always the team work.
###348 And I guess it does help.
###350 I mean, having satisfaction from work makes you go home
###354 and have a positive love life or relationship.
###360 It's obviously a full-on tattoo life.
###364 VALERIE VARGAS: You're going to have to get a spider web
###365 for this one.
###366 
###369 I think that would be nice.
###370 Either that, or get a spider web, actually, on the ball of
###372 your shoulder.
###373 STEWART ROBSON: There's not much outside of
###374 tattoos in our lives.
###378 And things have fallen by the wayside that aren't tattoos,
###381 or that we can't soak up information
###384 from to use in tattooing.
###385 But then, tattooing has given us so much.
###387 Our relationship is due to tattooing, our friends and the
###389 opportunities that arise.
###391 It's given us our lives, and we enjoy our lives.
###393 So keep feeding the beast.
###395 
###414 STEWART ROBSON (OFFSCREEN): [INAUDIBLE] neck.
###416 VALERIE VARGAS (OFFSCREEN): They always look
###417 like they're drunk.
###418 
###424 STEWART ROBSON (OFFSCREEN): He's pissed.
###426 He's not happy.
###428 VALERIE VARGAS: You think so?
###429 
###438 Yeah?
###439 Green dragon, some purple, some yellow, some red?
###443 MALE SPEAKER:
###447 VALERIE VARGAS (OFFSCREEN): Really?
###447 Because I thought I'd draw a peacock on you.
###449 MALE SPEAKER:
###454 VALERIE VARGAS (OFFSCREEN): Oh, that's
###455 definitely not green.
###456 Oh, no, no.
###457 That's definitely turquoise blue.
###458 That's not green.
###460 
###462 Like that kind of green.
###464 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): OK.
###465 VALERIE VARGAS: Basically, since I got into tattoos in
###467 2004 with my apprenticeship, I've just not stopped.
###470 And I'm catching up now with the fun stuff.
###474 And I keep reminding myself I'm a 30-year-old woman, I'm
###477 not a 15-year-old girl.
###479 I need to learn to drive, I need to learn to do things.
###483 I barely know how to cook.
###485 And he kind of jokes about it, but he's very
###487 serious at the same time.
###488 Like look, when we finally settle into this flat, I'm
###490 going to take you to the supermarket, and I'm going to
###491 teach you how to shop for food and stuff.
###493 Because I don't know how to shop for food.
###494 I literally go, I want a sandwich right
###496 now, I'll buy a sandwich.
###498 And then what do I eat tomorrow?
###499 I'm really bad like that, so he's going to help me a little
###503 bit, be a bit more domesticated.
###505 That's a sexy fish.
###509 Would you not agree?
###511 STEWART ROBSON: A sexy fish?
###512 VALERIE VARGAS: Yeah.
###513 
###515 Oh, look at that dude.
###516 How awesome is he?
###518 
###522 STEWART ROBSON (OFFSCREEN): It's just nice to grow
###524 alongside someone, as well.
###525 It's super cool.
###530 I guess we're still growing together.
###531 She's still developing.
###532 It's really cool to see that.
###533 And I'm still developing, and she's really
###535 supportive of that.
###537 Yeah.
###538 VALERIE VARGAS (OFFSCREEN): It really works for us.
###539 It's not for everybody.
###540 A lot of people do go, how do you do it?
###541 How do you live together, go to work together, work the
###543 same days, and hang out together on your days off?
###548 I don't know.
###548 It works.
###550 
###553 Can't hug you with this?
###554 STEWART ROBSON (OFFSCREEN): I know, bags everywhere.
###555 
###558 VALERIE VARGAS: You having fun?
###559 STEWART ROBSON: Yeah.
###561 STEWART ROBSON (OFFSCREEN): [INAUDIBLE]
###563 A little bit.
###564 VALERIE VARGAS: What do you want?
###564 STEWART ROBSON: Just stand there.
###567 [INAUDIBLE]
###568 
###571 VALERIE VARGAS: Hang on.
###574 Yeah?
###574 Enough?
###575 STEWART ROBSON: You hate having your picture taken.
###576 VALERIE VARGAS: I hate having my picture taken.
###579 STEWART ROBSON: [INAUDIBLE]
###580 VALERIE VARGAS: Yeah, he loves having his picture taken.
###582
