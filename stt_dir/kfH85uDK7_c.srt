0:0:0,98 --> 0:0:9,31
[MUSIC PLAYING]


3
0:0:9,31 --> 0:0:10,43
DANTE DIMASSA (OFFSCREEN):
Well, this is the next


4
0:0:10,43 --> 0:0:11,94
generation of tattooers.


5
0:0:11,94 --> 0:0:14,8
The next generation of tattooers
that grew up with


6
0:0:14,8 --> 0:0:16,3
the internet, and with
computers, are


7
0:0:16,3 --> 0:0:17,56
different from me.


8
0:0:17,56 --> 0:0:19,52
You see, I didn't grow
up with that.


9
0:0:19,52 --> 0:0:23,0
You have access to the internet
wherever you are.


10
0:0:23,0 --> 0:0:26,31
Even now, you do a great tattoo
with your iPhone, boom,


11
0:0:26,31 --> 0:0:27,84
stick it up on your Instagram.


12
0:0:27,84 --> 0:0:28,96
You've barely finished it.


13
0:0:28,96 --> 0:0:32,49
But everybody [INAUDIBLE]
my shop does this.


14
0:0:32,49 --> 0:0:36,6
Everybody's young, that's
what it is.


15
0:0:36,6 --> 0:0:39,5
My opinion is that everybody
has an opinion.


16
0:0:39,5 --> 0:0:42,69
And the internet is a great
place to air your opinion.


17
0:0:42,69 --> 0:0:43,8
A lot of time people
don't give a


18
0:0:43,8 --> 0:0:45,36
fuck about your opinion.


19
0:0:45,36 --> 0:0:47,34
Just keep doing the work.


20
0:0:47,34 --> 0:0:48,7
This is my opinion.


21
0:0:48,7 --> 0:0:51,32
If you want to validate yourself
as a good tattoo


22
0:0:51,32 --> 0:0:54,37
artist, and you choose the
internet to put your work out


23
0:0:54,37 --> 0:0:55,91
there, put it out there.


24
0:0:55,91 --> 0:0:58,322
Don't give a fucking opinion.


25
0:0:58,322 --> 0:0:58,79
Do you know what I mean?


26
0:0:58,79 --> 0:1:0,28
Because that's only
your opinion.


27
0:1:0,28 --> 0:1:3,39



28
0:1:3,39 --> 0:1:4,64
Again, that's my opinion.


29
0:1:4,64 --> 0:1:19,52



30
0:1:19,52 --> 0:1:23,54
STEFANO C.: Dante, or Danny, as
many people know him, I've


31
0:1:23,54 --> 0:1:25,52
known him for a long time.


32
0:1:25,52 --> 0:1:26,79
He's a [INAUDIBLE]


33
0:1:26,79 --> 0:1:30,465
He's got his own fetish for
denim and [INAUDIBLE]


34
0:1:30,465 --> 0:1:32,19
He wants to look cool.


35
0:1:32,19 --> 0:1:33,88
MALE SPEAKER: I can't help but
look at myself in the mirror


36
0:1:33,88 --> 0:1:36,21
wherever I am.


37
0:1:36,21 --> 0:1:40,166
MALE SPEAKER: Yep,
I love myself.


38
0:1:40,166 --> 0:1:41,528
[LAUGHTER]


39
0:1:41,528 --> 0:1:44,2



40
0:1:44,2 --> 0:1:46,78
STEFANO C.: He's like a very
good friend of mine.


41
0:1:46,78 --> 0:1:50,61
He took me down on his
protective wing.


42
0:1:50,61 --> 0:1:51,74
Didn't come for free.


43
0:1:51,74 --> 0:1:55,45
I had to work very
hard for it.


44
0:1:55,45 --> 0:1:57,6
Yeah, but he gave me the chance
to get me [? in the ?]


45
0:1:57,6 --> 0:1:58,71
shop.


46
0:1:58,71 --> 0:2:1,21
But through him, I had
the chance to see


47
0:2:1,21 --> 0:2:2,26
lots of good stuff.


48
0:2:2,26 --> 0:2:5,16
[INAUDIBLE]


49
0:2:5,16 --> 0:2:6,52
DANTE DIMASSA NARRATING: The
great thing about Frith Street


50
0:2:6,52 --> 0:2:9,49
is that we end up showcasing
really young tattoo artists


51
0:2:9,49 --> 0:2:10,8
that have a lot of talent.


52
0:2:10,8 --> 0:2:13,16
DANTE DIMASSA: This is Frith
Street, everybody.


53
0:2:13,16 --> 0:2:14,2
It's just gone that way.


54
0:2:14,2 --> 0:2:16,8
We showcase young talent.


55
0:2:16,8 --> 0:2:20,64
STEFANO C.: Now it's
me, Jordan Teear.


56
0:2:20,64 --> 0:2:23,92
There's Emiliano Liberatori,
Valerie Vargas.


57
0:2:23,92 --> 0:2:30,49
There's Stewart Robson, Oliver
Macintosh, and Miles Champlin.


58
0:2:30,49 --> 0:2:32,18
DANTE DIMASSA NARRATING: Frith
Street contributed to what's


59
0:2:32,18 --> 0:2:35,51
tattooing in London, or
in England, is today.


60
0:2:35,51 --> 0:2:39,0
DANTE DIMASSA: There's been a
few key shops over the last 10


61
0:2:39,0 --> 0:2:40,89
years that have done a lot
of great, great work.


62
0:2:40,89 --> 0:2:43,9
But also a lot of key artists.


63
0:2:43,9 --> 0:2:46,78
We're fortunate right now that
we're flavor of the month.


64
0:2:46,78 --> 0:2:50,875
So I suppose the right people
wanted to be involved in here


65
0:2:50,875 --> 0:2:52,68
and I think the hard work.


66
0:2:52,68 --> 0:2:54,0
That's what counts.


67
0:2:54,0 --> 0:2:58,13
That's what might of made
it like this, I think.


68
0:2:58,13 --> 0:2:59,62
VALERIE VARGAS: We've always
discussed amongst ourselves


69
0:2:59,62 --> 0:3:1,375
that Frith Street feels
a bit like boot camp.


70
0:3:1,375 --> 0:3:5,6
You come here, and if you're
open, and you work hard, you


71
0:3:5,6 --> 0:3:7,32
will be exposed to anything
and everything


72
0:3:7,32 --> 0:3:8,9
that's good in tattooing.


73
0:3:8,9 --> 0:3:10,68
STEWART ROBSON: It's where
young tattooists come.


74
0:3:10,68 --> 0:3:13,18
And they get whipped,
and broken, and


75
0:3:13,18 --> 0:3:15,2
driven into the ground.


76
0:3:15,2 --> 0:3:19,34
And then you come out a
stronger, better soldier in


77
0:3:19,34 --> 0:3:20,28
the end of it.


78
0:3:20,28 --> 0:3:21,781
STEFANO C.: Frith Street
has been like a kind


79
0:3:21,781 --> 0:3:23,34
of stage for people.


80
0:3:23,34 --> 0:3:25,59
You are definitely in the
place where you got a


81
0:3:25,59 --> 0:3:26,41
spotlight on you.


82
0:3:26,41 --> 0:3:28,99
And you get busy because
there's a big


83
0:3:28,99 --> 0:3:29,85
demand in the shop.


84
0:3:29,85 --> 0:3:32,52
So you try out different
things until you


85
0:3:32,52 --> 0:3:33,89
get on your set style.


86
0:3:33,89 --> 0:3:35,14
DANTE DIMASSA NARRATING: You
see, with Stewart, for


87
0:3:35,14 --> 0:3:37,9
example, Stewart kind of knew
what he wanted to do when he


88
0:3:37,9 --> 0:3:39,2
came and worked here.


89
0:3:39,2 --> 0:3:41,58
I don't think Valerie knew
what she wanted to do.


90
0:3:41,58 --> 0:3:44,1
She hadn't quite yet
found her groove.


91
0:3:44,1 --> 0:3:53,9



92
0:3:53,9 --> 0:3:54,51
VALERIE VARGAS: This will have
to be Stewart's, actually.


93
0:3:54,51 --> 0:3:56,656
I don't think it's mine.


94
0:3:56,656 --> 0:3:59,67
Yeah, it weighs a fucking ton.


95
0:3:59,67 --> 0:4:1,24
He just did everything, tribal,


96
0:4:1,24 --> 0:4:3,83
black and grey, Japanese.


97
0:4:3,83 --> 0:4:4,18
Girls.


98
0:4:4,18 --> 0:4:4,91
Traditional.


99
0:4:4,91 --> 0:4:6,335
Coverups.


100
0:4:6,335 --> 0:4:6,84
Magpie.


101
0:4:6,84 --> 0:4:8,115
Sharks.


102
0:4:8,115 --> 0:4:10,64
That's my chess piece
that he did for me.


103
0:4:10,64 --> 0:4:12,23
So frickn' painful.


104
0:4:12,23 --> 0:4:14,4
What is this?


105
0:4:14,4 --> 0:4:18,25
Nah, this is Stewart's as well,
again doing everything.


106
0:4:18,25 --> 0:4:18,87
Lettering.


107
0:4:18,87 --> 0:4:21,74
Japanese.


108
0:4:21,74 --> 0:4:24,36
So fucking good, honestly.


109
0:4:24,36 --> 0:4:25,11
STEWART ROBSON: I think
Valerie says


110
0:4:25,11 --> 0:4:25,74
she looks up to me.


111
0:4:25,74 --> 0:4:28,94
And I think it feels like
I'm justified in


112
0:4:28,94 --> 0:4:30,88
speaking about it.


113
0:4:30,88 --> 0:4:34,5
But I think she probably just
feels like she's more of an


114
0:4:34,5 --> 0:4:36,88
apprentice, or she's certainly
less experienced.


115
0:4:36,88 --> 0:4:41,12
But, maybe that's because I'm
more used to analyzing my


116
0:4:41,12 --> 0:4:43,99
thoughts, while she works
more gut instinct.


117
0:4:43,99 --> 0:4:48,37
But having someone to look up to
allows her to just run wild


118
0:4:48,37 --> 0:4:50,94
with her instincts, because she
knows that there's someone


119
0:4:50,94 --> 0:4:52,255
there to catch her
if she falls.


120
0:4:52,255 --> 0:4:53,82
Not that she ever does fall.


121
0:4:53,82 --> 0:4:58,99
But that mental safety net has
helped her kind of really get


122
0:4:58,99 --> 0:5:0,24
somewhere, I think.


123
0:5:0,24 --> 0:5:5,76



124
0:5:5,76 --> 0:5:6,99
VALERIE VARGAS: I've always
had some sort of website.


125
0:5:6,99 --> 0:5:9,18
And I had just drawing,
sketches,


126
0:5:9,18 --> 0:5:10,26
ramblings on my blog.


127
0:5:10,26 --> 0:5:12,24
Nothing exciting.


128
0:5:12,24 --> 0:5:14,4
I just did a couple of
commission pieces.


129
0:5:14,4 --> 0:5:16,51
This is basically what somebody
that doesn't know


130
0:5:16,51 --> 0:5:18,45
what's going on tried to draw.


131
0:5:18,45 --> 0:5:19,12
And they can draw.


132
0:5:19,12 --> 0:5:21,79
I mean just because you can
draw, doesn't mean you can


133
0:5:21,79 --> 0:5:23,345
tattoo, know how to
draw for a tattoo.


134
0:5:23,345 --> 0:5:26,66



135
0:5:26,66 --> 0:5:27,68
This is from a girl, actually.


136
0:5:27,68 --> 0:5:30,56
She stands in my mind as being
the first customer that was


137
0:5:30,56 --> 0:5:33,91
like, I just like the way
you do your thing.


138
0:5:33,91 --> 0:5:35,39
Can you kind of do
something for me?


139
0:5:35,39 --> 0:5:37,72
And we came up with
these designs.


140
0:5:37,72 --> 0:5:40,4
They were the first designs
that I thought, I'm liking


141
0:5:40,4 --> 0:5:42,67
where I'm going now,
rather than just


142
0:5:42,67 --> 0:5:45,17
blindly stumbling along.


143
0:5:45,17 --> 0:5:48,42
I think being at Frith Street,
and very quickly falling into


144
0:5:48,42 --> 0:5:51,41
some sort of category, meant
that I've not really done a


145
0:5:51,41 --> 0:5:52,27
lot of everything else.


146
0:5:52,27 --> 0:5:57,17
And when you only doing one
style, one thing, for a period


147
0:5:57,17 --> 0:6:0,12
of time, you're going to get
better quickly, to understand


148
0:6:0,12 --> 0:6:2,62
things quicker, and you
can develop quicker.


149
0:6:2,62 --> 0:6:5,22
STEFANO C.: I remember Valerie
coming to the shop.


150
0:6:5,22 --> 0:6:5,64
[INAUDIBLE]


151
0:6:5,64 --> 0:6:7,79
is [INAUDIBLE]


152
0:6:7,79 --> 0:6:10,7
She didn't have a set
style at the time.


153
0:6:10,7 --> 0:6:12,76
Obviously, she wasn't tattooing
for a long time.


154
0:6:12,76 --> 0:6:14,29
And then that she came
in with a portfolio.


155
0:6:14,29 --> 0:6:16,93
And I remember seeing
a couple of pinups.


156
0:6:16,93 --> 0:6:19,39
It wasn't what she's doing now,
obviously, because the


157
0:6:19,39 --> 0:6:23,16
evolution of tattoo work starts
whenever you find


158
0:6:23,16 --> 0:6:24,47
yourself comfortable
in a place.


159
0:6:24,47 --> 0:6:28,21
And I guess she did find Frith
Street as a place to settle


160
0:6:28,21 --> 0:6:31,94
down and start doing whatever
she does now.


161
0:6:31,94 --> 0:6:33,78
VALERIE VARGAS: Frith Street,
we hit the ground running.


162
0:6:33,78 --> 0:6:34,67
It was so busy.


163
0:6:34,67 --> 0:6:37,79
We were booked up weeks for
a couple weeks at a time.


164
0:6:37,79 --> 0:6:38,88
It was crazy.


165
0:6:38,88 --> 0:6:40,6
I didn't know what
I was doing.


166
0:6:40,6 --> 0:6:41,45
It was just so scary.


167
0:6:41,45 --> 0:6:42,75
And I wanted to impress Dante.


168
0:6:42,75 --> 0:6:45,6
And I wanted to make sure that
he felt like he had done the


169
0:6:45,6 --> 0:6:48,73
right thing by giving not only
me a job, and Stewart a job,


170
0:6:48,73 --> 0:6:50,35
but a couple a job.


171
0:6:50,35 --> 0:6:52,27
STEWART ROBSON: When we first
come down to Frith Street,


172
0:6:52,27 --> 0:6:55,56
definitely the first six months,
anything in life was


173
0:6:55,56 --> 0:6:56,88
just [INAUDIBLE]


174
0:6:56,88 --> 0:6:59,27
VALERIE VARGAS: The technical
aspect of it, how it feels on


175
0:6:59,27 --> 0:7:2,17
the skin, and the tension when
you stretch your hand, and


176
0:7:2,17 --> 0:7:2,54
everything.


177
0:7:2,54 --> 0:7:5,49
All that stuff, came
very slowly to me.


178
0:7:5,49 --> 0:7:9,7
But again, having a friend
that only had the best


179
0:7:9,7 --> 0:7:12,7
interests at heart to help
me, really built up your


180
0:7:12,7 --> 0:7:13,41
confidence.


181
0:7:13,41 --> 0:7:15,21
STEWART ROBSON: And we were so
focused on trying to make


182
0:7:15,21 --> 0:7:18,55
tattooing work, we were both
in our first five years.


183
0:7:18,55 --> 0:7:20,9
In the first five years,
you're an infant.


184
0:7:20,9 --> 0:7:23,23
You're busy soaking everything
up, and trying to learn, and


185
0:7:23,23 --> 0:7:26,41
trying to just cope
with tattooing.


186
0:7:26,41 --> 0:7:29,4
VALERIE VARGAS: The busier it
got, the better my technical


187
0:7:29,4 --> 0:7:30,55
ability got, as well.


188
0:7:30,55 --> 0:7:35,21
I do think that my drawing and
my design work developed ahead


189
0:7:35,21 --> 0:7:36,53
of that, however.


190
0:7:36,53 --> 0:7:39,37
But I managed to catch up
fairly quickly, I feel.


191
0:7:39,37 --> 0:7:42,29



192
0:7:42,29 --> 0:7:45,2
STEWART ROBSON: She started
really digging back in to old


193
0:7:45,2 --> 0:7:49,36
tattoo times, and looking
at Ed Hardy's work form


194
0:7:49,36 --> 0:7:50,67
the '70s and '80s.


195
0:7:50,67 --> 0:7:53,33
And then she realized that Ed
Hardy figured out the stuff


196
0:7:53,33 --> 0:7:56,11
she was trying to do almost
before she was born.


197
0:7:56,11 --> 0:7:57,34
And he nailed it.


198
0:7:57,34 --> 0:7:59,95
So then she used that
as a starting point.


199
0:7:59,95 --> 0:8:2,74
She spring-boarded off that and
see where she could go.


200
0:8:2,74 --> 0:8:5,5
And I think that's when her work
matured, and the style


201
0:8:5,5 --> 0:8:8,11
shifted into a more
adult style.


202
0:8:8,11 --> 0:8:10,69
VALERIE VARGAS: To me there
is certain things that are


203
0:8:10,69 --> 0:8:11,92
tattoos that look
like tattoos.


204
0:8:11,92 --> 0:8:14,58
And the quintessential tattoo
design is either a rose or a


205
0:8:14,58 --> 0:8:16,15
skull, for me, really.


206
0:8:16,15 --> 0:8:18,615
And if you have neither, then
you can't call yourself


207
0:8:18,615 --> 0:8:19,97
tattooed, yet.


208
0:8:19,97 --> 0:8:20,81
Really.


209
0:8:20,81 --> 0:8:22,56
I don't think.


210
0:8:22,56 --> 0:8:25,92
I think the turning point for
me was a nesting doll.


211
0:8:25,92 --> 0:8:27,52
It was one of the first
ones I ever done.


212
0:8:27,52 --> 0:8:29,53
I remember a lot of people
begun bringing that.


213
0:8:29,53 --> 0:8:31,86
They would print it, and bring
it, and wanted me to do it.


214
0:8:31,86 --> 0:8:33,99
A few months after that, like
two or three months, that's


215
0:8:33,99 --> 0:8:38,1
when I noticed I was getting
busier, booked up for three to


216
0:8:38,1 --> 0:8:38,96
four months.


217
0:8:38,96 --> 0:8:41,14
STEWART ROBSON: She tried to put
a barrier between all the


218
0:8:41,14 --> 0:8:42,51
phone calls that would
come every day.


219
0:8:42,51 --> 0:8:45,645
Every single day there'd be
maybe 10 to 15 people, I want


220
0:8:45,645 --> 0:8:47,18
to get tattooed by Valerie.


221
0:8:47,18 --> 0:8:49,11
But they didn't want
little tattoos.


222
0:8:49,11 --> 0:8:52,33
They wanted big three, four,
five session tattoos.


223
0:8:52,33 --> 0:8:54,593
And there's not enough time
in the day to tattoo that.


224
0:8:54,593 --> 0:8:56,82
And then 10 people,
10 new people.


225
0:8:56,82 --> 0:8:58,8
So she had to have
a waiting list.


226
0:8:58,8 --> 0:8:59,79
And then she didn't
really want that.


227
0:8:59,79 --> 0:9:2,93
VALERIE VARGAS: I know that I'm
booked up till October.


228
0:9:2,93 --> 0:9:3,62
So--


229
0:9:3,62 --> 0:9:4,98
hello, hello?


230
0:9:4,98 --> 0:9:7,356
If you get back in touch,
whenever you want to get


231
0:9:7,356 --> 0:9:9,56
tattooed, you might have
to wait a few months.


232
0:9:9,56 --> 0:9:10,29
Or you might--


233
0:9:10,29 --> 0:9:11,5
STEWART ROBSON: She's finally
got through that.


234
0:9:11,5 --> 0:9:13,4
It took two or three years
to get through that.


235
0:9:13,4 --> 0:9:15,515
And for someone who's only been
tattooing five or six


236
0:9:15,515 --> 0:9:17,35
years, that's a long
portion of your


237
0:9:17,35 --> 0:9:18,6
career to be in demand.


238
0:9:18,6 --> 0:9:22,214



239
0:9:22,214 --> 0:9:23,464
VALERIE VARGAS: No.


240
0:9:23,464 --> 0:9:27,582



241
0:9:27,582 --> 0:9:29,5
You don't want to go underneath
this, do you?


242
0:9:29,5 --> 0:9:29,98
STEWART ROBSON: I'm good.


243
0:9:29,98 --> 0:9:31,84
I've got a hat.


244
0:9:31,84 --> 0:9:36,84



245
0:9:36,84 --> 0:9:38,35
STEWART ROBSON: We've spoken
to Dante about


246
0:9:38,35 --> 0:9:39,57
our long-term plans.


247
0:9:39,57 --> 0:9:42,395
VALERIE VARGAS: And we were
thinking, what happens next?


248
0:9:42,395 --> 0:9:45,19
If we want to settle, if we
want to have a family?


249
0:9:45,19 --> 0:9:46,41
Are we going to stay
in London?


250
0:9:46,41 --> 0:9:48,4
Are we gonna stay
at Frith Street?


251
0:9:48,4 --> 0:9:49,52
STEWART ROBSON: Dante's
been so great to us.


252
0:9:49,52 --> 0:9:53,0
So trusting with his time and
letting us develop the way we


253
0:9:53,0 --> 0:9:54,25
needed to develop.


254
0:9:54,25 --> 0:9:56,71



255
0:9:56,71 --> 0:9:59,71
VALERIE VARGAS: He gave us
this huge chunk of trust.


256
0:9:59,71 --> 0:10:1,81
And what did we have
to do with it?


257
0:10:1,81 --> 0:10:3,82
We just made it work for
all three of us.


258
0:10:3,82 --> 0:10:6,3
STEWART ROBSON: And been
supportive in personal


259
0:10:6,3 --> 0:10:9,6
matters, and in business,
and in tattooing.


260
0:10:9,6 --> 0:10:11,34
VALERIE VARGAS: And really, for
the person that has given


261
0:10:11,34 --> 0:10:15,39
us, technically speaking, the
keys to the rest of our life.


262
0:10:15,39 --> 0:10:17,54
STEWART ROBSON: As well as owing
everything to tattooing,


263
0:10:17,54 --> 0:10:20,21
we owe everything in
tattooing to Dante.


264
0:10:20,21 --> 0:10:22,12
VALERIE VARGAS: And that's
part of the reason why I


265
0:10:22,12 --> 0:10:24,58
helped my mother move from
Scotland to London.


266
0:10:24,58 --> 0:10:26,91
STEWART ROBSON: And really
London, and Frith Street, is


267
0:10:26,91 --> 0:10:27,91
the best place for us.


268
0:10:27,91 --> 0:10:29,63
VALERIE VARGAS: We finally made
the decision that, yup,


269
0:10:29,63 --> 0:10:30,88
this is where we're
going to be.


270
0:10:30,88 --> 0:10:33,775



271
0:10:33,775 --> 0:10:34,264
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Oh my God.


272
0:10:34,264 --> 0:10:36,22
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Holy shit.


273
0:10:36,22 --> 0:10:37,27
VALERIE VARGAS (OFFSCREEN):
Yeah, we still got to do the


274
0:10:37,27 --> 0:10:37,68
bum cheeks.


275
0:10:37,68 --> 0:10:38,895
We're leaving that to last.


276
0:10:38,895 --> 0:10:39,34
[INTERPOSING VOICES]


277
0:10:39,34 --> 0:10:41,645
Aha, aha ha.


278
0:10:41,645 --> 0:10:41,949
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
That's


279
0:10:41,949 --> 0:10:43,28
another reason I cancelled.


280
0:10:43,28 --> 0:10:44,42
VALERIE VARGAS (OFFSCREEN):
Ha ha ha.


281
0:10:44,42 --> 0:10:45,185
Yeah, yeah.


282
0:10:45,185 --> 0:10:46,43
Ha ha.


283
0:10:46,43 --> 0:10:47,77
Oh shit, bum cheeks next.


284
0:10:47,77 --> 0:12:47,77
