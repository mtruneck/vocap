CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: A royal rule changed,
the possibility of invisibility, and a fighter


2
0:0:5,15 --> 0:0:9,3
who is fighting back against bullying. That`s
just some of what we are talking about today


3
0:0:9,3 --> 0:0:17,68
on CNN STUDENT NEWS.


4
0:0:17,68 --> 0:0:29,59
A lot of young people are out looking for
a job, but not working one. A new report says


5
0:0:29,59 --> 0:0:35,79
youth employment in the U.S. is at its lowest
level since the Second World War. We are talking


6
0:0:35,79 --> 0:0:40,76
about people ages 16 to 24. The Annie E. Casey
Foundation says that only half of them had


7
0:0:40,76 --> 0:0:46,86
jobs in 2011, and if you just look at teenagers,
only one in four had a job last year. In the


8
0:0:46,86 --> 0:0:52,87
year 2000 almost half of them did. The reasons
- the lingering effects of the great recession.


9
0:0:52,87 --> 0:0:57,559
A lot of the entry level jobs the young people
used to count on like those at clothing stores


10
0:0:57,559 --> 0:1:2,84
or restaurants, for example, are going to
more experienced or more educated workers.


11
0:1:2,84 --> 0:1:6,95
One side effect is that young people aren`t
getting the early work experience that would


12
0:1:6,95 --> 0:1:8,87
help them later on.


13
0:1:8,87 --> 0:1:13,7
Some organizations want to give students the
chance to get that experience, but not through


14
0:1:13,7 --> 0:1:17,87
job - at school, and not during regular classes
either. This is part of something called the


15
0:1:17,87 --> 0:1:22,77
time collaborative, and for around 20,000
students it means they are going to be spending


16
0:1:22,77 --> 0:1:27,77
more time at school. We are talking about
more than 40 schools in five states. Next


17
0:1:27,77 --> 0:1:32,83
school year, they are going to be open an
additional 300 hours, so it works out to about


18
0:1:32,83 --> 0:1:39,5
90 minutes extra a day on average. It won`t
necessarily mean more time in science or language


19
0:1:39,5 --> 0:1:43,55
arts classes, though that it`s possible. The
organizers say the extra time could be spent


20
0:1:43,55 --> 0:1:49,55
on internships, on apprenticeships or music
or arts programs. One goal would be to help


21
0:1:49,55 --> 0:1:55,34
low performing students do better. An analyst
says the program could help increase test


22
0:1:55,34 --> 0:2:0,68
scores, but it can also increase dropout rates.
He said that if the extra time looks and feels


23
0:2:0,68 --> 0:2:6,7
like the rest of the school day, then those
at-risk students might not go for it.


24
0:2:6,7 --> 0:2:10,289
A middle schooler who spoke to one of our
affiliates said students don`t want more time


25
0:2:10,289 --> 0:2:14,81
in school. She said students want to get a
break from learning. What do you say? We want


26
0:2:14,81 --> 0:2:19,52
to hear your thoughts on this. Let`s say your
school adds the extra time, an extra hour


27
0:2:19,52 --> 0:2:23,52
and a half. How would you want to spend it?
More academics, the focus on music and drama


28
0:2:23,52 --> 0:2:28,64
programs, getting internship or apprenticeship
credit. Tell us and tell us only your first


29
0:2:28,64 --> 0:2:31,14
names on our blog cnnstudentnews.com.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


31
0:2:33,4 --> 0:2:41,0
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: See, if you can I.D.
me. I was born in London in 1926 and I still


32
0:2:41,0 --> 0:2:46,87
live there. I have a royal title, but I don`t
actually run my country`s government. I ascended


33
0:2:46,87 --> 0:2:50,63
to the throne in 1952.


34
0:2:50,63 --> 0:3:0,49
I`m the United Kingdom`s Queen Elizabeth II,
and I have one younger sister, but no brothers.


35
0:3:0,49 --> 0:3:2,44
(END VIDEO CLIP)


36
0:3:2,44 --> 0:3:7,93
AZUZ: Now, here is why that last part`s important.
If Queen Elizabeth did have any brothers,


37
0:3:7,93 --> 0:3:12,59
even if they were younger than she, she wouldn`t
be queen. It all has to do with the order


38
0:3:12,59 --> 0:3:16,819
of succession. In the U.S. , succession has
to do with who takes over as president if


39
0:3:16,819 --> 0:3:20,54
something happens to the current president.
Well, for the British monarchy, succession


40
0:3:20,54 --> 0:3:26,459
is about who becomes king or queen. This is
Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge. She is married


41
0:3:26,459 --> 0:3:31,38
to Prince William, Queen Elizabeth`s grandson
and the couple is expecting a baby. Now, you


42
0:3:31,38 --> 0:3:35,569
might have heard about that. Right now, the
British order of succession goes from the


43
0:3:35,569 --> 0:3:41,38
queen to William`s dad, Prince Charles, and
then to Prince William. For more than 300


44
0:3:41,38 --> 0:3:45,93
years, the law said that a monarch`s first
born son was heir to the throne. If he had


45
0:3:45,93 --> 0:3:52,85
big sisters, he jumped in line ahead of them.
But the royal rules of succession are changing.


46
0:3:52,85 --> 0:3:58,34
From now on, the firstborn child will be heir,
so William and Catherine`s baby will be next


47
0:3:58,34 --> 0:4:3,43
in line for the throne and it won`t matter
whether it`s a boy or girl.


48
0:4:3,43 --> 0:4:7,459
Just eight days left for you to send us an
"I-Report" and maybe get a place on our show.


49
0:4:7,459 --> 0:4:11,88
We want to know how are you celebrating the
season of giving. You have to be at least


50
0:4:11,88 --> 0:4:17,81
13 years old. The video has to be 30 seconds
or less, and no music, just you and the camera.


51
0:4:17,81 --> 0:4:22,35
Please make sure to watch for our email. After
you submit your video, you get all the details


52
0:4:22,35 --> 0:4:25,22
in the "Spotlight" section at cnnstudentnews.com

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


54
0:4:26,54 --> 0:4:33,49
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today`s "Shoutout" goes
out to Mrs. Ross` CWP class at Eastmont High


55
0:4:33,49 --> 0:4:37,0
School in East Wenatchee, Washington.


56
0:4:37,0 --> 0:4:43,77
The word "camouflage" comes from what language.
You know what to do, is it Latin, Celtic,


57
0:4:43,77 --> 0:4:53,13
Greek or French? You`ve got three seconds,
go!


58
0:4:53,13 --> 0:4:59,81
Camouflage comes from a French word that means
"to disguise." That`s your answer and that`s


59
0:4:59,81 --> 0:5:0,93
your "Shoutout."


60
0:5:0,93 --> 0:5:2,61
(END VIDEO CLIP)


61
0:5:2,61 --> 0:5:8,74
AZUZ: And that`s what camouflage is meant
to do: to disguise. Usually military troops


62
0:5:8,74 --> 0:5:12,3
or their equipment although you probably know
somebody who just like to wear it from time


63
0:5:12,3 --> 0:5:16,34
to time. Now, you know camo when you see it.
You might think that the patterns in it are


64
0:5:16,34 --> 0:5:21,1
kind of random, but that`s actually not the
case. Chris Lawrence explains why there`s


65
0:5:21,1 --> 0:5:24,61
a lot to look at when you are designing clothing
to make people disappear.


66
0:5:24,61 --> 0:5:25,1
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


67
0:5:25,1 --> 0:5:29,11
CHRIS LAWRENCE, CNN CORRESPONDENT: A lot is
riding on the next generation design to outfit


68
0:5:29,11 --> 0:5:35,61
troops. It`s only been eight years since the
Army spent $5 billion on camo that critics


69
0:5:35,61 --> 0:5:41,8
say didn`t fool anyone. Soldiers complained
to the point the Army abandoned its one size


70
0:5:41,8 --> 0:5:43,59
fits all universal pattern.


71
0:5:43,59 --> 0:5:46,76
(on camera): So, they were looking for camouflage
that they could use everywhere.


72
0:5:46,76 --> 0:5:50,29
GUY CRAMER, HYPER STEALTH/ADS: Correct. And
it didn`t work anywhere.


73
0:5:50,29 --> 0:5:54,91
LAWRENCE: Guy Cramer is one of the designers
competing to win the Army`s next multimillion


74
0:5:54,91 --> 0:6:1,6
dollar contract. This summer, he showed us
the science behind every shape, size and shade


75
0:6:1,6 --> 0:6:1,87
of these pixels.


76
0:6:1,87 --> 0:6:5,21
(on camera): You now have your camouflage.


77
0:6:5,21 --> 0:6:8,919
CRAMER: So we are trying to trick the brain
into seeing things that aren`t actually there.


78
0:6:8,919 --> 0:6:14,51
LAWRENCE (voice over): Digital patterns recreate
shapes already found in nature. And 3-D layering


79
0:6:14,51 --> 0:6:21,47
creates depth and shadows where non exist.
That`s today`s design. But developers already


80
0:6:21,47 --> 0:6:23,34
have one eye on tomorrow.


81
0:6:23,34 --> 0:6:28,6
CRAMER: What`s coming up down the road, and
very quickly, is the Harry Potter cloak.


82
0:6:28,6 --> 0:6:29,68
RUPERT GRINT, ACTOR: What is that?


83
0:6:29,68 --> 0:6:33,93
LAWRENCE: With that fictional cloak, Harry
isn`t just camouflage, he is invisible.


84
0:6:33,93 --> 0:6:35,449
DANIEL RADCLIFFE, ACTOR: My body is gone!


85
0:6:35,449 --> 0:6:42,3
LAWRENCE (on camera): How invisible are we
talking here? If I walk into a room with the


86
0:6:42,3 --> 0:6:44,59
soldier wearing one of these cloaks?


87
0:6:44,59 --> 0:6:49,31
CRAMER: You wouldn`t see him at all. He would
be completely invisible to you.


88
0:6:49,31 --> 0:6:53,57
LAWRENCE (voice over): This is not make believe.
The military has seen the so-called quantum


89
0:6:53,57 --> 0:6:59,729
stealth technology. It works by banding the
light around an object, even concealing most


90
0:6:59,729 --> 0:7:5,29
of a person shadow. Imagine what that could
do for a sniper hiding in the field or the


91
0:7:5,29 --> 0:7:10,35
American pilots who ejected over Libya when
their fighter jets crashed last year.


92
0:7:10,35 --> 0:7:14,93
CRAMER: They could actually pull out very
similar to what they carry with a survival


93
0:7:14,93 --> 0:7:19,37
blanket, throw it over top of them. And unless
you walked right into them, you wouldn`t know


94
0:7:19,37 --> 0:7:20,28
that they were there.


95
0:7:20,28 --> 0:7:25,229
LAWRENCE: So, what was once firmly in the
world of make believe, could quickly become


96
0:7:25,229 --> 0:7:25,94
quite real.


97
0:7:25,94 --> 0:7:26,44
(END VIDEOTAPE)


98
0:7:26,44 --> 0:7:30,24
AZUZ: All right, and this one is going to
sound a little strange at first: a plan to


99
0:7:30,24 --> 0:7:34,71
stop bullying by encouraging fighting. It
makes a little more sense when you find out


100
0:7:34,71 --> 0:7:39,29
that one of the program`s organizers is a
mixed martial arts` champion, and his goal


101
0:7:39,29 --> 0:7:43,54
is to keep fighting in the ring instead of
at his school. Have a look.


102
0:7:43,54 --> 0:7:45,0
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


103
0:7:45,0 --> 0:7:54,28
ROB MCCULLOUGH: Hey, I`m Rob McCullough, and
we can make an impact on bullying. This campaign


104
0:7:54,28 --> 0:7:59,34
is about anti-bullying and it`s about the
epidemic that`s going on nowadays in our schools.


105
0:7:59,34 --> 0:8:4,88
And it`s about kids being picked on, kids,
you know, being bullied and for them to find


106
0:8:4,88 --> 0:8:10,12
a safe haven through sports. Anti-bullying
is similar to what we are doing with L.A.


107
0:8:10,12 --> 0:8:14,62
Boxing. We go to schools in neighboring areas
that we have gyms, so that we know that there


108
0:8:14,62 --> 0:8:16,479
is a safe haven for these kids to go to.


109
0:8:16,479 --> 0:8:21,38
I dealt with bullying growing up as a kid,
because I was always the new guy at the school.


110
0:8:21,38 --> 0:8:22,43
I was always moving.


111
0:8:22,43 --> 0:8:28,7
The message I`m trying to convey to these
kids at the assemblies is that with a little


112
0:8:28,7 --> 0:8:33,39
hard work and motivation and a positive mental
attitude, you can, you know, you can literally


113
0:8:33,39 --> 0:8:36,209
do anything you want to do.


114
0:8:36,209 --> 0:8:42,579
Some of the people that we`ve had do assemblies
with us, is Dana White, the president of the


115
0:8:42,579 --> 0:8:48,269
UFC, TRT`s Michael Bisping, Rampage Quinton
Jackson. The list goes on. We are not fighting


116
0:8:48,269 --> 0:8:51,5
because we don`t like each other or because
we are bullying each other, we are fighting


117
0:8:51,5 --> 0:8:54,11
because it`s a sport. Sport did that for me,
and it did that for a lot of my friends that


118
0:8:54,11 --> 0:8:55,24
are professional athletes.


119
0:8:55,24 --> 0:8:58,1
It gives you something to focus on.


120
0:8:58,1 --> 0:9:1,19
Join the movement, impact your world.


121
0:9:1,19 --> 0:9:2,569

AZUZ: You can learn more about Rob McCullough`s
fight against bullying by clicking the "Impact


123

story today is sweet. It`s a gingerbread house.


124
0:9:14,1 --> 0:9:18,329
It`s the White House. It`s both. It`s the
work of a woman in Alabama who calls herself


125
0:9:18,329 --> 0:9:23,879
"the gingerbread lady. Normally, it takes
her about 12 hours to finish one of her confectionary


126
0:9:23,879 --> 0:9:30,9
creations. This one took 12 days. OK, it might
just be a replica of a real life building,


127
0:9:30,9 --> 0:9:34,1
but it`s filled with a lot of personal touches,
so it`s definitely not just like some cookie


128
0:9:34,1 --> 0:9:38,119
cutter copy. We don`t know how much it would
sell for, but making it probably took a lot


129
0:9:38,119 --> 0:9:43,16
of dough and the story delicious, getting
to make puns at the end, that`s just the icing


130
0:9:43,16 --> 0:9:46,79
on the house, yo. I hope you enjoy the rest
of your day. For CNN STUDENT NEWS, I`m Carl
