Buzzard Auditorium
on the campus of


4
0:0:46,33 --> 0:0:55,4
Eastern Illinois University,
it's "Issues and Attitudes".


5
0:0:55,4 --> 0:0:56,7
(Dr. Janice Collins).
Good evening.


6
0:0:56,7 --> 0:0:59,133
Good evening and welcome to
"Issues and Attitudes", a town


7
0:0:59,133 --> 0:1:2,667
hall meeting just for you
to ask certain questions,


8
0:1:2,667 --> 0:1:5,233
serious questions
about a serious topic.


9
0:1:5,233 --> 0:1:8,367
I'm your host and moderator
tonight, Dr. Janice Collins.


10
0:1:8,367 --> 0:1:10,7
Welcome to everyone,
thank you for coming.


11
0:1:10,7 --> 0:1:13,467
The earthquake in Japan has
reminded us all that disaster


12
0:1:13,467 --> 0:1:16,567
can strike us at any time
and in many ways that


13
0:1:16,567 --> 0:1:18,533
we can hardly imagine.


14
0:1:18,533 --> 0:1:21,133
And while we in central
Illinois may not be at risk


15
0:1:21,133 --> 0:1:24,733
for a tsunami, we do share
one thing in common with


16
0:1:24,733 --> 0:1:26,733
our friends in Japan.


17
0:1:26,733 --> 0:1:29,33
We depend on nuclear power to
generate a substantial portion


18
0:1:29,33 --> 0:1:31,167
of our electrical power.


19
0:1:31,167 --> 0:1:34,33
And with the benefits
there comes risk.


20
0:1:34,33 --> 0:1:35,667
According to the Nuclear
Energy Institute,


21
0:1:35,667 --> 0:1:38,733
almost 48 percent of
Illinois' electricity


22
0:1:38,733 --> 0:1:41,333
is generated by nuclear power.


23
0:1:41,333 --> 0:1:43,9
Illinois is home to 10 active
nuclear power plants with


24
0:1:43,9 --> 0:1:48,0
at least 4 with the same design
as the Fukushima plant that was


25
0:1:48,0 --> 0:1:49,867
damaged by the
earthquake, tsunami,


26
0:1:49,867 --> 0:1:52,6
and the power outage
that resulted.


27
0:1:52,6 --> 0:1:54,867
Most of the plants operate
in the northern portion


28
0:1:54,867 --> 0:1:57,233
of the state but on the
Clinton--as far as the


29
0:1:57,233 --> 0:2:0,733
Clinton nuclear power plant
that's located less than 80


30
0:2:0,733 --> 0:2:5,667
miles away from Charleston--it
must be noted that it's 80


31
0:2:5,667 --> 0:2:8,133
miles away from Charleston
and it does not have the


32
0:2:8,133 --> 0:2:11,4
same design as the
Fukushima plants.


33
0:2:11,4 --> 0:2:15,2
We are here tonight to discuss
what are the realistic risks of


34
0:2:15,2 --> 0:2:18,733
the radiation release from a
nuclear power plant in Illinois


35
0:2:18,733 --> 0:2:23,433
and are we prepared to handle
the emergency that could result.


36
0:2:23,433 --> 0:2:26,133
Joining me to help facilitate
this conversation and to help


37
0:2:26,133 --> 0:2:32,2
answer your questions we are
joined by Mr. Jonathon Monken,


38
0:2:32,2 --> 0:2:35,7
the Director of the Illinois
Emergency Management Agency,


39
0:2:35,7 --> 0:2:41,67
and the IEMA is the agency
responsible for coordinating


40
0:2:41,67 --> 0:2:43,1
the state's emergency
response for a


41
0:2:43,1 --> 0:2:46,133
wide assortment of
potential situations.


42
0:2:46,133 --> 0:2:47,333
Good evening and thank
you for joining us.


43
0:2:47,333 --> 0:2:48,33
(Mr. Jonathon Monken).
Good evening, my pleasure,


44
0:2:48,33 --> 0:2:50,333
thanks for having me.


45
0:2:50,333 --> 0:2:51,967

48
0:2:56,3 --> 0:2:59,0
in how nuclear power is
generated and the effects


49
0:2:59,0 --> 0:3:2,367
that radiation can have on
humans and the environment.


50
0:3:2,367 --> 0:3:4,3
We want to thank you
graciously for agreeing


51
0:3:4,3 --> 0:3:6,8
to assist us at
the last minute.


52
0:3:6,8 --> 0:3:7,933
Thank you so much.


53
0:3:7,933 --> 0:3:8,733
(Dr. Steven Daniels).
Thank you.


54
0:3:8,733 --> 0:3:9,967
(Dr. Collins).
Mr. Cameron Craig is a


55
0:3:9,967 --> 0:3:13,8
well-known geology professor at
Eastern Illinois University who


56
0:3:13,8 --> 0:3:16,9
is an expert on weather
and the environment.


57
0:3:16,9 --> 0:3:18,533
Good evening and thank
you for joining us.


58
0:3:18,533 --> 0:3:19,333
(Mr. Cameron Craig).
Good evening, thank you.


59
0:3:19,333 --> 0:3:20,2
(Dr. Collins).
And then finally


60
0:3:20,2 --> 0:3:22,367
we'd also like to welcome,
in our audience,


61
0:3:22,367 --> 0:3:26,167
Mr. Pat Goodwin, the
Charleston Fire Chief


62
0:3:26,167 --> 0:3:28,933
and the person responsible for
developing and overseeing


63
0:3:28,933 --> 0:3:32,0
the city's emergency
response team.


64
0:3:32,0 --> 0:3:33,967
Thank you, sir, for joining us.


65
0:3:33,967 --> 0:3:36,267
Welcome to everyone,
welcome to us all.


66
0:3:36,267 --> 0:3:40,733
Let's go ahead and get
started, this is a huge topic.


67
0:3:40,733 --> 0:3:47,9
I guess I first want to ask,
the first question is, well,


68
0:3:47,9 --> 0:3:51,467
I could ask are we safe but
to make sure that we have an


69
0:3:51,467 --> 0:3:55,467
understanding, can you describe
just for the audience and


70
0:3:55,467 --> 0:3:58,6
for the listeners and the
viewers how the Fukushima plant


71
0:3:58,6 --> 0:4:1,1
was designed and how
the problem evolved


72
0:4:1,1 --> 0:4:7,433
so we're all on the same page
before we begin the discussion.


73
0:4:7,433 --> 0:4:8,8
(Mr. Monken).
Basically what we've seen--


74
0:4:8,8 --> 0:4:10,567
and information is
limited unfortunately,


75
0:4:10,567 --> 0:4:13,5
as far as how much detail
we're getting from Japan at


76
0:4:13,5 --> 0:4:16,167
this point to find out exactly
what the significant damage


77
0:4:16,167 --> 0:4:19,433
was, what the critical damage
was that ultimately caused it.


78
0:4:19,433 --> 0:4:20,5
But as you mentioned,


79
0:4:20,5 --> 0:4:22,4
there are some similarities
in the designs.


80
0:4:22,4 --> 0:4:24,367
Really what you're looking at is
just the inner containment


81
0:4:24,367 --> 0:4:27,167
facility is what's similar,
which is the GE Mark 1.


82
0:4:27,167 --> 0:4:29,2
So the overall plant
itself, there are actually


83
0:4:29,2 --> 0:4:31,3
some very significant
differences.


84
0:4:31,3 --> 0:4:33,867
Ultimately, over the course of
the last 30 or 40 years that


85
0:4:33,867 --> 0:4:36,7
these nuclear power plants in
Illinois have been operational,


86
0:4:36,7 --> 0:4:38,533
there have been significant
upgrades that have been made


87
0:4:38,533 --> 0:4:41,3
to the facilities, multiple
alterations and expansions


88
0:4:41,3 --> 0:4:44,367
that have happened, that have
really changed the system here


89
0:4:44,367 --> 0:4:46,67
that you would find in the
plants as compared to


90
0:4:46,67 --> 0:4:47,833
what you saw in Japan.


91
0:4:47,833 --> 0:4:49,833
But ultimately, based on the
information that we have


92
0:4:49,833 --> 0:4:51,6
available, what we've
seen is that it


93
0:4:51,6 --> 0:4:53,633
really wasn't the earthquake
that ultimately caused


94
0:4:53,633 --> 0:4:56,733
the situation that they have
at the Fukushima plant.


95
0:4:56,733 --> 0:5:0,267
It actually withstood that
earthquake fairly well.


96
0:5:0,267 --> 0:5:2,433
Ultimately, the problem
was the following tsunami


97
0:5:2,433 --> 0:5:4,367
as you mentioned before.


98
0:5:4,367 --> 0:5:7,7
Now obviously the magnitude of
both instances, both emergencies


99
0:5:7,7 --> 0:5:10,33
was far beyond anything
that they had planned on.


100
0:5:10,33 --> 0:5:13,167
But ultimately what
the tsunami did was,


101
0:5:13,167 --> 0:5:16,933
it knocked out the back-up
power supplies to the plant.


102
0:5:16,933 --> 0:5:18,633
As ironic as this sounds,
a nuclear power plant


103
0:5:18,633 --> 0:5:21,567
needs electricity in
order to function,


104
0:5:21,567 --> 0:5:23,867
so it cannot run by itself.


105
0:5:23,867 --> 0:5:26,633
So ultimately what happened is,
the system shut down by itself


106
0:5:26,633 --> 0:5:28,667
as it's supposed to do.


107
0:5:28,667 --> 0:5:30,4
The reactor shut itself
down in response to


108
0:5:30,4 --> 0:5:32,433
the initial earthquake.


109
0:5:32,433 --> 0:5:35,533
Ultimately what happened is when
the tsunami came in, a 40-foot


110
0:5:35,533 --> 0:5:39,767
tidal wave basically wiped out
their back-up diesel generators.


111
0:5:39,767 --> 0:5:41,667
And that's something that all
the power plants in the state of


112
0:5:41,667 --> 0:5:44,6
Illinois have, you have a
redundant back-up diesel


113
0:5:44,6 --> 0:5:46,3
generating system to
make sure that the plant


114
0:5:46,3 --> 0:5:48,567
never fully loses power.


115
0:5:48,567 --> 0:5:50,3
Well in this case it actually
knocked out all of the


116
0:5:50,3 --> 0:5:53,867
backup power and, arguably
just as significant,


117
0:5:53,867 --> 0:5:55,933
it knocked out all of
the backup fuel.


118
0:5:55,933 --> 0:5:58,833
Whereas in Illinois we
have all of our fuel,


119
0:5:58,833 --> 0:6:1,333
basically the diesel fuel
is stored underground,


120
0:6:1,333 --> 0:6:2,9
there it was stored
above ground.


121
0:6:2,9 --> 0:6:5,267
And when the tsunami came in it
knocked out the generators and


122
0:6:5,267 --> 0:6:7,7
all of the fuel, and they
were ultimately unable to


123
0:6:7,7 --> 0:6:10,5
restore power directly to the
plant in order to get the


124
0:6:10,5 --> 0:6:13,5
coolant flowing through what's
called the spent fuel pool.


125
0:6:13,5 --> 0:6:17,0
So after the draining rods are
used for power generation


126
0:6:17,0 --> 0:6:18,7
they are removed
from the core and


127
0:6:18,7 --> 0:6:20,7
placed in what is called
a spent fuel pool.


128
0:6:20,7 --> 0:6:22,933
That's incredibly hot.


129
0:6:22,933 --> 0:6:25,467
And as it happens--and the
really, really unfortunate


130
0:6:25,467 --> 0:6:29,3
timing is--those spent fuel rods
had just been removed within


131
0:6:29,3 --> 0:6:31,9
months of this disaster
happening, and those


132
0:6:31,9 --> 0:6:35,33
take somewhere between 12
and 15 years to cool down.


133
0:6:35,33 --> 0:6:37,5
So they'd only been out
for a couple of months.


134
0:6:37,5 --> 0:6:39,567
If you can't get coolant
through the spent fuel pool,


135
0:6:39,567 --> 0:6:41,6
that's actually where we're
getting radiation from,


136
0:6:41,6 --> 0:6:43,933
not the inner core, but
these spent rods that


137
0:6:43,933 --> 0:6:45,667
were already used
for electricity.


138
0:6:45,667 --> 0:6:47,33
(Dr. Collins).
Okay, and thank you


139
0:6:47,33 --> 0:6:50,333
for that explanation.


140
0:6:50,333 --> 0:6:54,67
Spinning off of just the last
part of the radiation, talk a


141
0:6:54,67 --> 0:6:57,333
little bit about the effects of
the radiation, containing the


142
0:6:57,333 --> 0:7:0,667
radiation, because at the very
beginning when it first happened


143
0:7:0,667 --> 0:7:4,33
the reports were we don't
have to worry about it.


144
0:7:4,33 --> 0:7:7,767
We're all the way in Illinois,
but we're starting to see, we've


145
0:7:7,767 --> 0:7:13,167
already seen the creeping in of
certain elements of radiation in


146
0:7:13,167 --> 0:7:15,9
our water and our plants
and our air supply.


147
0:7:15,9 --> 0:7:17,967
Can you tell me a little bit
about radiation, what that


148
0:7:17,967 --> 0:7:20,133
means, but also what does that
mean for our environment and


149
0:7:20,133 --> 0:7:25,3
for the humans here.


150
0:7:25,3 --> 0:7:29,4
(Dr. Daniels).
Radiation, the deal is that


151
0:7:29,4 --> 0:7:31,8
we get radiation all the time.


152
0:7:31,8 --> 0:7:34,33
It's coming from cosmic rays
it's coming from background in


153
0:7:34,33 --> 0:7:36,167
the soil, it's coming
from everywhere.


154
0:7:36,167 --> 0:7:42,467
We get a little bit all the time
but nonetheless, the sense is


155
0:7:42,467 --> 0:7:45,333
that any radiation is still
going to harm the body.


156
0:7:45,333 --> 0:7:50,3
It has some damage to cells
almost no matter what.


157
0:7:50,3 --> 0:7:53,4
So the question is how
much can you take.


158
0:7:53,4 --> 0:7:55,8
When we're talking about
these trace amounts we're


159
0:7:55,8 --> 0:8:0,133
talking about amounts that are
lower than the background,


160
0:8:0,133 --> 0:8:1,767
or basically around
the background level.


161
0:8:1,767 --> 0:8:3,333
We're not talking about
amounts that are going


162
0:8:3,333 --> 0:8:6,733
to be significantly dangerous.


163
0:8:6,733 --> 0:8:14,9
However, if the coolant
and the waste fuel,


164
0:8:14,9 --> 0:8:17,967
that stuff is very hot, and it
is hot enough that it would


165
0:8:17,967 --> 0:8:21,67
be a significant danger
to a person right there.


166
0:8:21,67 --> 0:8:23,967
But here we are halfway around
the world, it's going to be much


167
0:8:23,967 --> 0:8:27,533
dilute by the time it
gets here, if any of it.


168
0:8:27,533 --> 0:8:31,467
Even though it has gotten here
it's at much lower levels,


169
0:8:31,467 --> 0:8:35,6
so the danger to humans at this
point is probably pretty low,


170
0:8:35,6 --> 0:8:37,767
at least in Illinois.


171
0:8:37,767 --> 0:8:39,5
(Dr. Collins).
Okay, so that's good.


172
0:8:39,5 --> 0:8:40,8
Yes, professor.


173
0:8:40,8 --> 0:8:42,333
(Mr. Craig).
When you talk about the


174
0:8:42,333 --> 0:8:44,567
atmospheric concepts
here that, you know,


175
0:8:44,567 --> 0:8:47,2
Fukushima creates its own heat


176
0:8:47,2 --> 0:8:49,267
and so it creates its
own low pressure.


177
0:8:49,267 --> 0:8:51,567
And so all that radiation gets
into the upper atmosphere and


178
0:8:51,567 --> 0:8:55,633
is carried by the jet
stream over North America.


179
0:8:55,633 --> 0:9:2,567
Over time it is dispersed so
it's not as concentrated,


180
0:9:2,567 --> 0:9:4,367
so it does eventually
fall from the sky.


181
0:9:4,367 --> 0:9:7,467
It's like, you know, we have
dust storms in the Great Plains.


182
0:9:7,467 --> 0:9:9,7
The dust gets picked up,
carried by the jet stream, and


183
0:9:9,7 --> 0:9:12,5
lands here in the Midwest, so
it is the same kind of thing,


184
0:9:12,5 --> 0:9:17,333
but it's minute, it's
very traceable.


185
0:9:17,333 --> 0:9:18,633
(Mr. Monken).
And if I may add to that,


186
0:9:18,633 --> 0:9:19,967
ultimately what we
found is obviously,


187
0:9:19,967 --> 0:9:21,9
we have detection systems
throughout the state of


188
0:9:21,9 --> 0:9:24,533
Illinois that ultimately,
that's how we identify


189
0:9:24,533 --> 0:9:26,667
and we take these samples
on a regular basis,


190
0:9:26,667 --> 0:9:29,0
whether there is a
disaster globally or not.


191
0:9:29,0 --> 0:9:31,533
In this particular case what
we've identified as an isotope


192
0:9:31,533 --> 0:9:33,9
is iodine 131.


193
0:9:33,9 --> 0:9:37,7
And iodine 131 is not, obviously
in large quantities or heavy


194
0:9:37,7 --> 0:9:40,833
doses or things like that,
it's 10 percent gamma and


195
0:9:40,833 --> 0:9:43,67
gamma is what you need
to be concerned with.


196
0:9:43,67 --> 0:9:45,233
Ultimately that's where you have
the biggest risk involved, but


197
0:9:45,233 --> 0:9:48,2
what we have detected here--as
you mentioned we've detected it


198
0:9:48,2 --> 0:9:52,2
on grass, we've detected it in
the air--what we have detected


199
0:9:52,2 --> 0:9:56,867
is more than 2,000 times
below the level at which


200
0:9:56,867 --> 0:9:59,533
there would be any
amount of concern.


201
0:9:59,533 --> 0:10:1,933
And ultimately as an isotope it
only has a half-life of 8 days


202
0:10:1,933 --> 0:10:4,567
which is good because it's
not really persistent,


203
0:10:4,567 --> 0:10:7,233
it's something that will
go away very quickly.


204
0:10:7,233 --> 0:10:9,133
(Dr. Collins).
Okay, so then are you


205
0:10:9,133 --> 0:10:12,8
saying that we don't, because
it's so small and it's diluted


206
0:10:12,8 --> 0:10:14,567
in its travel, we don't have to


207
0:10:14,567 --> 0:10:18,67
worry about these
levels rising?


208
0:10:18,67 --> 0:10:19,367
(Mr. Monken).
Certainly not,


209
0:10:19,367 --> 0:10:21,1
unless there was actually
an additional source of


210
0:10:21,1 --> 0:10:23,8
radiation or something
more significant.


211
0:10:23,8 --> 0:10:26,733
All radiological disasters
from this perspective are


212
0:10:26,733 --> 0:10:28,9
rated on a scale
of one to seven.


213
0:10:28,9 --> 0:10:31,867
So what we've seen at Fukushima
is something similar to what we


214
0:10:31,867 --> 0:10:34,67
saw at Three Mile Island
three decades ago,


215
0:10:34,67 --> 0:10:36,333
which is a level five.


216
0:10:36,333 --> 0:10:38,567
Something bigger than that is
something like Chernobyl,


217
0:10:38,567 --> 0:10:41,867
which is a level seven, where
actually the inner core of a


218
0:10:41,867 --> 0:10:43,6
nuclear power plant
is exposed, which


219
0:10:43,6 --> 0:10:47,433
is fortunately, thankfully,
not what we saw at Fukushima.


220
0:10:47,433 --> 0:10:49,967
(Mr. Craig).
And distance is a big deal, too.


221
0:10:49,967 --> 0:10:52,933
When you consider Chernobyl
that's half a world away,


222
0:10:52,933 --> 0:10:55,833
you know, as far as the jet
stream is concerned, because of


223
0:10:55,833 --> 0:11:1,1
the westerly winds, everything
comes from the west,


224
0:11:1,1 --> 0:11:4,133
and so it gets
diluted over time.


225
0:11:4,133 --> 0:11:5,633
(Dr. Collins).
Okay, okay, great.


226
0:11:5,633 --> 0:11:10,467
That's really interesting
and an absolute easy way


227
0:11:10,467 --> 0:11:11,767
to understand it.


228
0:11:11,767 --> 0:11:14,333
I wish we had it during our news
breaks and our news packages.


229
0:11:14,333 --> 0:11:15,367
We could all put that in one


230
0:11:15,367 --> 0:11:19,433
one-and-a-half-minute
package there.


231
0:11:19,433 --> 0:11:23,9
Let's, you know, we're dealing
with the unknown.


232
0:11:23,9 --> 0:11:28,967
I want to move a little bit
toward "what if", okay.


233
0:11:28,967 --> 0:11:35,767
I want to understand and ask how
do you prepare for the unknown,


234
0:11:35,767 --> 0:11:41,267
because things are happening and
occurring that are not natural.


235
0:11:41,267 --> 0:11:46,3
Whether it's man-made,
whether it's just nature,


236
0:11:46,3 --> 0:11:48,133
it's unpredictable.


237
0:11:48,133 --> 0:11:52,8
So I want to know and ask, how
do you prepare for the unknown.


238
0:11:52,8 --> 0:11:56,6
Are we prepared for
even an earthquake?


239
0:11:56,6 --> 0:11:59,2
If something were to
happen with our plants,


240
0:11:59,2 --> 0:12:2,1
since we have so many,
are we still protected?


241
0:12:2,1 --> 0:12:5,0
Let's say the unknown, the
unthinkable, the impossible


242
0:12:5,0 --> 0:12:9,867
actually happens, as we
continue to see globally.


243
0:12:9,867 --> 0:12:11,433
So I'll ask the first question.


244
0:12:11,433 --> 0:12:18,933
Are we prepared for the unknown,
and if so, how are we prepared?


245
0:12:18,933 --> 0:12:19,9
(Mr. Monken).
I guess what you


246
0:12:19,9 --> 0:12:22,767
probably did with
that comment is


247
0:12:22,767 --> 0:12:25,767
you completely encapsulated
what my entire job entails.


248
0:12:25,767 --> 0:12:30,633
[panel laughter].


249
0:12:30,633 --> 0:12:32,0
So thank you for doing an
excellent job of really


250
0:12:32,0 --> 0:12:34,367
articulating what it is that I
actually am charged to do for


251
0:12:34,367 --> 0:12:36,133
the state of Illinois,
which is prepare for


252
0:12:36,133 --> 0:12:39,667
those types of things that
you can't prepare for.


253
0:12:39,667 --> 0:12:41,467
So really the mandate
for IEMA is to cover,


254
0:12:41,467 --> 0:12:43,233
it's just like FEMA, I mean,


255
0:12:43,233 --> 0:12:45,0
that's what we do at the
state level is we cover,


256
0:12:45,0 --> 0:12:47,4
as we describe it, everything
from terrorists to tornadoes


257
0:12:47,4 --> 0:12:49,867
and everything in between,
so any type of disaster,


258
0:12:49,867 --> 0:12:52,133
whether it's man-made
or it's natural.


259
0:12:52,133 --> 0:12:54,5
So as you mentioned, there are
many things that can actually


260
0:12:54,5 --> 0:12:57,267
threaten the state of Illinois,
and something that people don't


261
0:12:57,267 --> 0:12:59,533
often realize is that we
actually sit very close


262
0:12:59,533 --> 0:13:2,133
to a major fault line.


263
0:13:2,133 --> 0:13:3,767
In this case, it's
the New Madrid fault


264
0:13:3,767 --> 0:13:5,967
and the Wabash fault.


265
0:13:5,967 --> 0:13:8,867
And as it happens, for the last
two-and-a-half years, we've


266
0:13:8,867 --> 0:13:11,733
been preparing for what's called
a national level exercise.


267
0:13:11,733 --> 0:13:14,3
It's run by FEMA and at this
point, includes nine states


268
0:13:14,3 --> 0:13:17,467
participating in it and we're
actually simulating a


269
0:13:17,467 --> 0:13:21,1
7.7-magnitude earthquake on
the New Madrid fault line.


270
0:13:21,1 --> 0:13:22,4
(Dr. Collins).
And this is 250 miles


271
0:13:22,4 --> 0:13:23,833
away, that's where we are?


272
0:13:23,833 --> 0:13:24,7
(Mr. Monken).
That's correct.


273
0:13:24,7 --> 0:13:26,333
Yeah, we're about 250 miles
away from the epicenter.


274
0:13:26,333 --> 0:13:29,633
New Madrid, Missouri is
technically the center of mass,


275
0:13:29,633 --> 0:13:32,3
if you will, for that
particular fault line.


276
0:13:32,3 --> 0:13:34,8
And those are the types of
things that we have to consider.


277
0:13:34,8 --> 0:13:36,6
Now, as you mentioned
before, there's actually


278
0:13:36,6 --> 0:13:42,1
6 nuclear power plants with 11
active reactors, as far as the


279
0:13:42,1 --> 0:13:44,667
nuclear power generation
in the state of Illinois.


280
0:13:44,667 --> 0:13:46,933
The closest one to a fault line
is actually the one that you


281
0:13:46,933 --> 0:13:49,533
mentioned which is Clinton,
which is about 250 miles


282
0:13:49,533 --> 0:13:51,633
from that fault line.


283
0:13:51,633 --> 0:13:53,8
And that's obviously why
we're exercising the way


284
0:13:53,8 --> 0:13:56,667
we're exercising now is to
simulate what would be the


285
0:13:56,667 --> 0:13:58,567
impact of something like that.


286
0:13:58,567 --> 0:14:1,467
Ultimately what we have to do is
we have to try and come up with


287
0:14:1,467 --> 0:14:4,967
the most unexpected things
that you can imagine,


288
0:14:4,967 --> 0:14:7,67
I mean, that's really
what we're designed for.


289
0:14:7,67 --> 0:14:9,967
So that's why we continue to
plan, rehearse, drill, and we


290
0:14:9,967 --> 0:14:13,4
try and look at things that
either haven't happened before


291
0:14:13,4 --> 0:14:16,867
or, when you look at the case
of the New Madrid fault line,


292
0:14:16,867 --> 0:14:20,433
we're actually on the 200th
anniversary of the last


293
0:14:20,433 --> 0:14:22,467
major earthquake on
that fault line,


294
0:14:22,467 --> 0:14:26,633
which was in 1811 and 1812, and
it was powerful enough that


295
0:14:26,633 --> 0:14:29,333
it actually reversed the flow
of the Mississippi River and


296
0:14:29,333 --> 0:14:31,333
rang church bells in Boston.


297
0:14:31,333 --> 0:14:33,833
That's a pretty significant
earthquake if you're looking at


298
0:14:33,833 --> 0:14:36,967
the impact and obviously I won't
get too far into the science


299
0:14:36,967 --> 0:14:39,7
because I'm not the
expert--as you mentioned,


300
0:14:39,7 --> 0:14:41,5
there's no "Dr." at the
beginning of my name.


301
0:14:41,5 --> 0:14:43,2
[panel laughter].


302
0:14:43,2 --> 0:14:47,33
But Japan in one respect was
fortunate simply because you're


303
0:14:47,33 --> 0:14:50,333
really talking about whether or
not this magnitude of earthquake


304
0:14:50,333 --> 0:14:52,833
travels through rock versus
what you see here in Illinois,


305
0:14:52,833 --> 0:14:55,467
which is much looser soil.


306
0:14:55,467 --> 0:14:57,3
(Dr. Collins).
That can be a challenge,


307
0:14:57,3 --> 0:14:58,167
right, that could be
one of the challenges.


308
0:14:58,167 --> 0:14:59,567
(Mr. Monken).
Right, and I would say that


309
0:14:59,567 --> 0:15:1,733
we are as prepared as
we could possibly be


310
0:15:1,733 --> 0:15:3,33
for those types of events.


311
0:15:3,33 --> 0:15:6,2
We actually drill every six
months at each of the power


312
0:15:6,2 --> 0:15:8,833
plants, so we rotate through
between the six power plants.


313
0:15:8,833 --> 0:15:12,6
So basically, what it comes out
to is every six months we're


314
0:15:12,6 --> 0:15:16,467
doing a nuclear response
exercise at one of those plants.


315
0:15:16,467 --> 0:15:18,367
(Dr. Collins).
Okay.


316
0:15:18,367 --> 0:15:20,8
(Mr. Craig).
You said 7 magnitude


317
0:15:20,8 --> 0:15:22,2
on the Richter scale.


318
0:15:22,2 --> 0:15:24,267
Why is that the
magic number?


319
0:15:24,267 --> 0:15:25,533
(Mr. Monken).
Ultimately, that was the


320
0:15:25,533 --> 0:15:28,967
closest estimate that we had of
what happened in 1811 and 1812,


321
0:15:28,967 --> 0:15:31,5
is they estimated between
a 7 and an 8 magnitude


322
0:15:31,5 --> 0:15:33,767
on the Richter scale,
which obviously


323
0:15:33,767 --> 0:15:35,967
is only one dimension of
what you have to consider


324
0:15:35,967 --> 0:15:37,533
when you look at an earthquake.


325
0:15:37,533 --> 0:15:40,7
What you're really looking for
is the g-force of the actual


326
0:15:40,7 --> 0:15:43,133
impact of the earthquake,
or the ground speed.


327
0:15:43,133 --> 0:15:44,967
And that's what was so
significant in Japan,


328
0:15:44,967 --> 0:15:48,0
why it resulted in such a
humongous tsunami is that


329
0:15:48,0 --> 0:15:50,733
the g-forces created by
the earthquake were


330
0:15:50,733 --> 0:15:54,933
orders of magnitude beyond
anything in recorded history.


331
0:15:54,933 --> 0:15:57,367
So that's ultimately what
created the biggest problem.


332
0:15:57,367 --> 0:16:1,367
So you can have a 7.7-magnitude
earthquake that actually doesn't


333
0:16:1,367 --> 0:16:4,0
do a whole lot of damage, or you
can actually have something


334
0:16:4,0 --> 0:16:7,233
like you did in New Zealand
where you have a 6.2-magnitude


335
0:16:7,233 --> 0:16:10,0
earthquake that does horrific
damage because that was


336
0:16:10,0 --> 0:16:13,8
the second most powerful
earthquake in recorded history.


337
0:16:13,8 --> 0:16:17,867
(Mr. Craig).
So in preparation for a 9,


338
0:16:17,867 --> 0:16:20,9
would there be any, you know,
because there's been some


339
0:16:20,9 --> 0:16:23,2
concern that some of
the reactors here in


340
0:16:23,2 --> 0:16:28,133
the United States are
at 7, but we have 9.


341
0:16:28,133 --> 0:16:30,6
(Dr. Daniels).
It's my understanding that


342
0:16:30,6 --> 0:16:34,867
Fukushima was designed for 8,
and all the Japanese ones are


343
0:16:34,867 --> 0:16:38,67
designed for 8 because that
was the biggest recorded,


344
0:16:38,67 --> 0:16:41,867
so they were covered according
to what might have worked,


345
0:16:41,867 --> 0:16:44,867
but then something comes along
that's even bigger than that.


346
0:16:44,867 --> 0:16:45,9
(Mr. Monken).
That's exactly right.


347
0:16:45,9 --> 0:16:48,8
They were designed to withstand
a magnitude of 8.0 earthquake


348
0:16:48,8 --> 0:16:51,467
and a 30-foot tsunami,
so what they got was


349
0:16:51,467 --> 0:16:55,4
a 42-foot tsunami and
a 9.0 earthquake.


350
0:16:55,4 --> 0:16:57,0
(Dr. Daniels).
An important point is that


351
0:16:57,0 --> 0:16:59,767
the difference between 8
and 9 is a factor of 10.


352
0:16:59,767 --> 0:17:1,9
One's 10 times stronger.


353
0:17:1,9 --> 0:17:6,433
The 9 is 10 times stronger
than the 8, so that's a lot.


354
0:17:6,433 --> 0:17:8,0
(Mr. Craig).
And on top of that, the


355
0:17:8,0 --> 0:17:11,9
tsunami--33-foot--they
had prepared.


356
0:17:11,9 --> 0:17:14,567
Over 30 years they built walls
to protect themselves from


357
0:17:14,567 --> 0:17:19,9
tsunamis but because of the
tectonics, that whole coast line


358
0:17:19,9 --> 0:17:25,633
dropped 3 meters and so it
allowed water to spill over.


359
0:17:25,633 --> 0:17:27,233
(Dr. Collins).
Okay, so even though--and I want


360
0:17:27,233 --> 0:17:29,667
to ask this question, then I'm
going to ask Chief Goodwin


361
0:17:29,667 --> 0:17:31,833
if he will, to step to the
mic because I did want


362
0:17:31,833 --> 0:17:34,967
to ask you--or have the mic
brought to him--but I did want


363
0:17:34,967 --> 0:17:40,233
to ask about the local response
in the next question or so.


364
0:17:40,233 --> 0:17:44,3
So am I to understand that
because we're not under the


365
0:17:44,3 --> 0:17:50,33
threat of a tsunami, even though
we have reactors that have the


366
0:17:50,33 --> 0:17:54,0
same design, that we really
don't have the same concern


367
0:17:54,0 --> 0:17:58,9
because we really don't have to
worry about the tsunami?


368
0:17:58,9 --> 0:18:2,267
So we can handle an earthquake,
but because the tsunami that you


369
0:18:2,267 --> 0:18:6,133
said was really what pushed it
over, we're still okay, we're


370
0:18:6,133 --> 0:18:8,67
going to be okay?


371
0:18:8,67 --> 0:18:10,133
(Mr. Monken).
I would tell you no matter what,


372
0:18:10,133 --> 0:18:12,233
I mean, I can tell you that each
of the plants here in Illinois


373
0:18:12,233 --> 0:18:14,167
were designed basically
to withstand the threats


374
0:18:14,167 --> 0:18:16,133
that are most
significant to them.


375
0:18:16,133 --> 0:18:19,1
So earthquakes is certainly
one, but obviously some of


376
0:18:19,1 --> 0:18:21,533
the distance involved
helps insulate those,


377
0:18:21,533 --> 0:18:23,567
and there's a reason why Clinton
is the farthest south that any


378
0:18:23,567 --> 0:18:26,567
nuclear power plant was
constructed in Illinois.


379
0:18:26,567 --> 0:18:28,633
But obviously, we have other
things to be concerned with.


380
0:18:28,633 --> 0:18:31,533
We have floods as an
issue--there's a plant in


381
0:18:31,533 --> 0:18:33,833
Quad Cities right along
the Mississippi River.


382
0:18:33,833 --> 0:18:35,667
Tornadoes are
obviously a concern.


383
0:18:35,667 --> 0:18:39,7
In Virginia, we just saw that
within the last 36 hours they


384
0:18:39,7 --> 0:18:43,367
actually had a tornado wipe out
power to that power plant and


385
0:18:43,367 --> 0:18:45,967
they're operating on backup
diesel generators right now.


386
0:18:45,967 --> 0:18:50,33
So you bring up a good point
that even if we don't have


387
0:18:50,33 --> 0:18:53,67
an earthquake of the magnitude,
or let's say we do but we don't


388
0:18:53,67 --> 0:18:56,467
have a tsunami threat, I
think what this has taught


389
0:18:56,467 --> 0:19:0,67
a lot of people, especially
in my line of work, is that


390
0:19:0,67 --> 0:19:2,533
you absolutely have to
kind of throw out the book


391
0:19:2,533 --> 0:19:5,0
on what you think is the
worst-case scenario.


392
0:19:5,0 --> 0:19:8,5
So in my conversations with the
governor, talking about this


393
0:19:8,5 --> 0:19:10,5
because this is obviously
something significant


394
0:19:10,5 --> 0:19:13,167
in his mind, is you
actually have to start


395
0:19:13,167 --> 0:19:15,467
playing the "what if"
game, just like you said.


396
0:19:15,467 --> 0:19:18,7
What if there was an earthquake
and a flood and a tornado,


397
0:19:18,7 --> 0:19:20,433
and they all happened
simultaneously?


398
0:19:20,433 --> 0:19:22,433
Those are the types of
preparations that you have to


399
0:19:22,433 --> 0:19:27,133
make in order to insure that all
those plants are safe and that


400
0:19:27,133 --> 0:19:29,667
we have a response that
fits those types of needs.


401
0:19:29,667 --> 0:19:32,333
(Dr. Collins).
Okay, and let's move to then,


402
0:19:32,333 --> 0:19:34,33
from the state to the local.


403
0:19:34,33 --> 0:19:36,3
Chief Goodwin, I
wanted to ask you,


404
0:19:36,3 --> 0:19:39,6
let's say the unthinkable
does happen.


405
0:19:39,6 --> 0:19:41,2
What do we have in place?


406
0:19:41,2 --> 0:19:46,867
Do we have procedures and
processes in place so that


407
0:19:46,867 --> 0:19:50,333
we're ready for the unknown
because you also, sir, have to


408
0:19:50,333 --> 0:19:53,0
prepare for the unknown
as well, correct?


409
0:19:53,0 --> 0:19:54,933
We've prepared as
much as we can.


410
0:19:54,933 --> 0:19:58,0
You say the unknown,
what is the unknown?


411
0:19:58,0 --> 0:20:1,3
We can prepare for
what we can do.


412
0:20:1,3 --> 0:20:3,133
We've got the NIMS
training throughout


413
0:20:3,133 --> 0:20:4,467
the city and throughout
the county, which is


414
0:20:4,467 --> 0:20:6,433
the National Incident Management
System, so we're all on the


415
0:20:6,433 --> 0:20:9,5
same page on the incident.


416
0:20:9,5 --> 0:20:11,9
Charleston and Coles County and
most of Illinois belongs to a


417
0:20:11,9 --> 0:20:16,67
MABAS organization--that's a
Mutual Aid Box Alarm System.


418
0:20:16,67 --> 0:20:18,967
It started in northern Illinois
years ago, it's covered the


419
0:20:18,967 --> 0:20:23,67
state of Illinois, Missouri,
Wisconsin, and Indiana now.


420
0:20:23,67 --> 0:20:26,3
It's the same system that
when we went to New Orleans,


421
0:20:26,3 --> 0:20:27,567
when they needed help,


422
0:20:27,567 --> 0:20:31,167
Illinois sent a task force
down--that's through MABAS.


423
0:20:31,167 --> 0:20:35,1
Charleston here, mainly composed
of Charleston firefighters and


424
0:20:35,1 --> 0:20:38,567
Mattoon firefighters, have the
technical rescue teams and


425
0:20:38,567 --> 0:20:41,567
also the HAZMAT team
for this part of Illinois.


426
0:20:41,567 --> 0:20:46,6
We cover a huge part of
southern and central Illinois.


427
0:20:46,6 --> 0:20:48,967
With that, we are prepared
as much as we can,


428
0:20:48,967 --> 0:20:51,9
we have some highly
trained individuals.


429
0:20:51,9 --> 0:20:55,1
You talk about the dispense of
the technical rescue and HAZMAT.


430
0:20:55,1 --> 0:20:57,367
All Charleston fire and
police vehicles have


431
0:20:57,367 --> 0:20:59,467
radiation detectors in them
that are going any time the


432
0:20:59,467 --> 0:21:1,33
vehicles are on the streets.


433
0:21:1,33 --> 0:21:7,5
You talk about the radiation,
there's two to four millirads in


434
0:21:7,5 --> 0:21:11,267
the background just driving
around towns now so it's out


435
0:21:11,267 --> 0:21:14,2
there but we're prepared
as much as we can be.


436
0:21:14,2 --> 0:21:18,1
With the MABAS though,
we can call in resources.


437
0:21:18,1 --> 0:21:22,867
We have potentially four
states at our hand.


438
0:21:22,867 --> 0:21:25,933
With one phone call I can
request whatever resources


439
0:21:25,933 --> 0:21:28,767
I need, with one phone call they
will deploy them and have them


440
0:21:28,767 --> 0:21:30,733
here within a few hours.


441
0:21:30,733 --> 0:21:32,67
(Dr. Collins).
Great, great answer.


442
0:21:32,67 --> 0:21:33,567
Good, very complete answer.


443
0:21:33,567 --> 0:21:35,8
What I'd like to do is take a
short break.


444
0:21:35,8 --> 0:21:39,67
We've talked a little bit about
how it all started in Japan.


445
0:21:39,67 --> 0:21:42,7
There are other areas that we
may have to consider that are


446
0:21:42,7 --> 0:21:45,633
a little closer to us than Japan
and the effects of if something


447
0:21:45,633 --> 0:21:49,633
happened there--would we
really be ready for all of this?


448
0:21:49,633 --> 0:21:52,0
So I want to take a short break
and we'll be right back with


449
0:21:52,0 --> 0:21:56,8
questions from the audience and
continue our discussion on the


450
0:21:56,8 --> 0:22:0,467
nuclear reaction and
safety of Illinois.


451
0:22:0,467 --> 0:22:4,1
[no dialogue].


452
0:22:4,1 --> 0:22:8,7
(Dr. Collins).
Okay, great, thank you so much.


453
0:22:8,7 --> 0:22:12,167
Welcome back, welcome
back, everyone.


454
0:22:12,167 --> 0:22:13,833
I wanted to ask one
quick question


455
0:22:13,833 --> 0:22:15,833
before we go to the audience.


456
0:22:15,833 --> 0:22:18,633
When we talk about nuclear
safety, I wanted to ask


457
0:22:18,633 --> 0:22:20,367
how is it outlined basically?


458
0:22:20,367 --> 0:22:22,0
Can you tell us a little bit
more about that, please?


459
0:22:22,0 --> 0:22:23,2
(Mr. Monken).
Sure, yeah, the Illinois


460
0:22:23,2 --> 0:22:24,7
Department of Nuclear Safety
has actually been around


461
0:22:24,7 --> 0:22:27,367
for several decades and it
was beefed up significantly


462
0:22:27,367 --> 0:22:30,1
following the Three Mile Island
incident because those types


463
0:22:30,1 --> 0:22:32,5
of questions, the questions
that we're asking right now,


464
0:22:32,5 --> 0:22:34,767
those were questions that
were raised at that time.


465
0:22:34,767 --> 0:22:36,8
And there was a significant
investment made by the state of


466
0:22:36,8 --> 0:22:40,3
Illinois to really develop what
is now really the premier


467
0:22:40,3 --> 0:22:43,133
nuclear safety program
in the country.


468
0:22:43,133 --> 0:22:44,833
So we have several systems
that are actually


469
0:22:44,833 --> 0:22:47,1
unique to Illinois that no
one else actually has.


470
0:22:47,1 --> 0:22:49,133
One of them is called a
resident inspector program,


471
0:22:49,133 --> 0:22:53,0
where our department actually
has third-party independent


472
0:22:53,0 --> 0:22:56,933
radiological inspectors that
actually work at each of these


473
0:22:56,933 --> 0:23:0,0
plants, so we actually have
a triple redundant system.


474
0:23:0,0 --> 0:23:1,633
The company that
owns them, Exelon,


475
0:23:1,633 --> 0:23:3,667
they have their own
resident inspectors.


476
0:23:3,667 --> 0:23:6,67
The NRC, the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission, they have them.


477
0:23:6,67 --> 0:23:7,833
What's unique to Illinois is we
actually have a third tier of


478
0:23:7,833 --> 0:23:10,733
inspectors that actually
work for IEMA and


479
0:23:10,733 --> 0:23:13,167
conduct inspections
at those plants.


480
0:23:13,167 --> 0:23:15,633
We also have something called
the remote monitoring system.


481
0:23:15,633 --> 0:23:20,833
We take data from more than a
thousand sensors in each of the


482
0:23:20,833 --> 0:23:24,1
plants, and we can actually
collect and interpret all that


483
0:23:24,1 --> 0:23:27,667
data in real time, so we will
actually know if there is an


484
0:23:27,667 --> 0:23:31,267
incident inside the plant before
the company actually knows it.


485
0:23:31,267 --> 0:23:34,533
And all of this is centered
around a program called REAC,


486
0:23:34,533 --> 0:23:36,67
which is actual physical
location in the


487
0:23:36,67 --> 0:23:38,867
State Emergency Operations
Center that collects all this


488
0:23:38,867 --> 0:23:41,933
data 24 hours a day, 7 days
a week in real time and


489
0:23:41,933 --> 0:23:45,2
actually represents it
graphically for our personnel.


490
0:23:45,2 --> 0:23:47,767
And the last thing is an actual
part of the remote monitoring


491
0:23:47,767 --> 0:23:50,633
system, is gaseous
detectors that are


492
0:23:50,633 --> 0:23:53,433
actually surrounding each
of the power plants.


493
0:23:53,433 --> 0:23:55,967
So, at a radius of 2 miles
around each of the plants,


494
0:23:55,967 --> 0:23:58,5
they collect--24 hours
a day, 7 days a week--


495
0:23:58,5 --> 0:24:1,367
they collect data so we can
actually tell if there is a


496
0:24:1,367 --> 0:24:3,267
radiological leak or
a leak of radiation


497
0:24:3,267 --> 0:24:4,633
from any of the plants.


498
0:24:4,633 --> 0:24:7,367
We can tell which direction it's
going, how significant it is,


499
0:24:7,367 --> 0:24:9,7
what types of isotopes
we're looking at,


500
0:24:9,7 --> 0:24:10,6
which is very unique.


501
0:24:10,6 --> 0:24:12,7
There's no one else in the
country that has that.


502
0:24:12,7 --> 0:24:15,333
(Dr. Collins).
Great points, good to know.


503
0:24:15,333 --> 0:24:19,233
And also I think it's important
for us to mention that Exelon is


504
0:24:19,233 --> 0:24:22,4
the owner of these
reactors, correct?


505
0:24:22,4 --> 0:24:23,667
(Mr. Monken).
That's right.


506
0:24:23,667 --> 0:24:25,0
(Dr. Collins).
All of them, so I think that's


507
0:24:25,0 --> 0:24:27,2
important in your
narrative there.


508
0:24:27,2 --> 0:24:28,0
Thank you so much.


509
0:24:28,0 --> 0:24:30,267
We're going to take a
question from the audience,


510
0:24:30,267 --> 0:24:31,167
or a statement.


511
0:24:31,167 --> 0:24:33,67
Sir if you would step
straight to the mic and pull


512
0:24:33,67 --> 0:24:36,167
the mic down a little bit so we
can hear what you're saying.


513
0:24:36,167 --> 0:24:37,833
(Dr. Alan Baharlou).
I can hold it.


514
0:24:37,833 --> 0:24:38,567
(Dr. Collins).
Okay.


515
0:24:38,567 --> 0:24:40,433
[laughter].


516
0:24:40,433 --> 0:24:41,4
(Dr. Baharlou).
I'm Alan Baharlou.


517
0:24:41,4 --> 0:24:43,567
I'm a geochemist.


518
0:24:43,567 --> 0:24:47,8
First of all, yes, New Madrid
moved 200 years ago and


519
0:24:47,8 --> 0:24:51,8
because of that the tension
is building around it.


520
0:24:51,8 --> 0:24:55,767
[unclear audio].


521
0:24:55,767 --> 0:24:58,933
And it just moved like
the San Andreas fault.


522
0:24:58,933 --> 0:25:3,833
And that would be
devastating--shock, travel.


523
0:25:3,833 --> 0:25:8,167
It's there at any moment.


524
0:25:8,167 --> 0:25:14,33
Two, all this nuclear waste that
we have has, Steve knows,


525
0:25:14,33 --> 0:25:20,33
plutonium and plutonium radiates
alpha and alpha penetrates


526
0:25:20,33 --> 0:25:22,733
anything--you need only one
atom.


527
0:25:22,733 --> 0:25:25,667
It goes through the body, goes
through the membrane of the


528
0:25:25,667 --> 0:25:30,7
cell, goes through the nucleus
and damages the regulatory gene.


529
0:25:30,7 --> 0:25:36,133
The regulatory gene goes berserk
and that's what cancer is.


530
0:25:36,133 --> 0:25:40,633
It's not like solar radiation,
radiation from your lamp.


531
0:25:40,633 --> 0:25:43,433
Steve knows, highly
penetrative.


532
0:25:43,433 --> 0:25:45,933
You only need one atom.


533
0:25:45,933 --> 0:25:51,233
You cannot see it, cannot taste
it, you cannot smell it.


534
0:25:51,233 --> 0:25:56,333
And all of this nuclear waste,
which is now stored at the


535
0:25:56,333 --> 0:26:0,4
nuclear power plant in the pool,
we don't know where to take it,


536
0:26:0,4 --> 0:26:3,0
where to dispose of it.


537
0:26:3,0 --> 0:26:6,633
There is a place, Yucca
Mountain, supposedly.


538
0:26:6,633 --> 0:26:10,967
If that ever happens, all this
waste will travel to American


539
0:26:10,967 --> 0:26:14,433
highways from east to west.


540
0:26:14,433 --> 0:26:17,567
All you need is one accident.


541
0:26:17,567 --> 0:26:21,167
So, in other words and the
fourth, an airplane could crash


542
0:26:21,167 --> 0:26:25,33
in any of these nuclear power
plants, so I don't want us


543
0:26:25,33 --> 0:26:29,1
to be pessimistic but I'll
finish my statement.


544
0:26:29,1 --> 0:26:34,867
When Einstein discovered
E=MC2--that statement- he said,


545
0:26:34,867 --> 0:26:39,3
the unleashed power of the
atom has changed everything


546
0:26:39,3 --> 0:26:41,6
except our way of thinking,


547
0:26:41,6 --> 0:26:45,4
thus we drift toward
unparalleled catastrophe.


548
0:26:45,4 --> 0:26:47,933
(Dr. Collins).
Okay, thank you sir.


549
0:26:47,933 --> 0:26:51,67
So, Dr. Daniels, you were
called out by name,


550
0:26:51,67 --> 0:26:52,6
we're going to let
you respond to that.


551
0:26:52,6 --> 0:26:55,633
(Dr. Daniels).
Okay, well first of all,


552
0:26:55,633 --> 0:26:58,5
there are three main types of
radiation that we consider.


553
0:26:58,5 --> 0:27:0,433
There's alpha, beta and gamma.


554
0:27:0,433 --> 0:27:5,733
The alpha particle is basically
helium with high energy.


555
0:27:5,733 --> 0:27:8,633
The beta particle is
basically an electron


556
0:27:8,633 --> 0:27:12,5
and the gamma particle is a
photon with high energy.


557
0:27:12,5 --> 0:27:14,9
The alpha particles
will basically be


558
0:27:14,9 --> 0:27:16,867
stopped by a piece of paper.


559
0:27:16,867 --> 0:27:19,367
Because they are so
massive and so large,


560
0:27:19,367 --> 0:27:22,0
they're very easy to stop.


561
0:27:22,0 --> 0:27:25,867
However, if they get inside your
body, they get stopped by your


562
0:27:25,867 --> 0:27:30,867
body and, therefore, they can do
significant damage that way.


563
0:27:30,867 --> 0:27:35,8
So it's when you ingest
alpha emitters that


564
0:27:35,8 --> 0:27:38,5
that can have the
most damage there.


565
0:27:38,5 --> 0:27:41,9
The beta emitters can go a few
centimeters, a few tenths of a


566
0:27:41,9 --> 0:27:44,867
centimeter, so they would
go inside your skin.


567
0:27:44,867 --> 0:27:47,767
They can actually start to harm
your body, but it's the gammas


568
0:27:47,767 --> 0:27:54,133
that actually go through you and
can impact deep tissue.


569
0:27:54,133 --> 0:27:56,133
(Dr. Collins).
Now, okay, I'm not a physicist


570
0:27:56,133 --> 0:27:59,133
or any of those "icists."


571
0:27:59,133 --> 0:28:4,533
I just wanted to ask though, is
that one of the reasons why our


572
0:28:4,533 --> 0:28:9,8
first point of attack or defense
was in the air, in the water


573
0:28:9,8 --> 0:28:13,867
supply, in the plants--things
that we can ingest--is that why


574
0:28:13,867 --> 0:28:18,0
we've been looking and
monitoring those particular


575
0:28:18,0 --> 0:28:21,467
elements every six
months, as you say?


576
0:28:21,467 --> 0:28:22,633
(Mr. Monken). 
Absolutely, I mean, really,


577
0:28:22,633 --> 0:28:26,467
that's the best way to tell
and a lot of times--and you


578
0:28:26,467 --> 0:28:30,1
can certainly expand on this
quite a bit--there can be


579
0:28:30,1 --> 0:28:32,6
significant inconsistencies
just in areas of the state.


580
0:28:32,6 --> 0:28:34,567
Northern Illinois versus
southern Illinois--it's a large


581
0:28:34,567 --> 0:28:35,9
geographic area.


582
0:28:35,9 --> 0:28:38,6
So when we take air samples
from northern Illinois and air


583
0:28:38,6 --> 0:28:41,5
samples from southern Illinois
or grass samples--and


584
0:28:41,5 --> 0:28:44,767
we also do milk, we do fish, we
do water, all of these types of


585
0:28:44,767 --> 0:28:46,767
things--we test them
on a regular basis.


586
0:28:46,767 --> 0:28:49,2
This is something we did long
before anything happened to


587
0:28:49,2 --> 0:28:51,0
Japan, but that's why you
have to test all areas


588
0:28:51,0 --> 0:28:54,2
of the state--because there are
a lot of environmental factors


589
0:28:54,2 --> 0:28:57,167
that could actually cause
certain things to go to certain


590
0:28:57,167 --> 0:28:58,967
places where you
wouldn't see it.


591
0:28:58,967 --> 0:29:0,667
But that's exactly why we
test it because that's


592
0:29:0,667 --> 0:29:3,767
the air you breathe, it's
the grass you walk on,


593
0:29:3,767 --> 0:29:6,67
it's the fish that you eat, it's
the milk that you drink--those


594
0:29:6,67 --> 0:29:8,967
are the types of things that
we need to be able to check.


595
0:29:8,967 --> 0:29:11,567
(Dr. Collins).
Okay, well, let me ask this.


596
0:29:11,567 --> 0:29:14,1
From an environmental
point of view then,


597
0:29:14,1 --> 0:29:17,2
because one of the things that
we haven't been able to control,


598
0:29:17,2 --> 0:29:19,367
one of the things that we
haven't been able to say is


599
0:29:19,367 --> 0:29:21,767
"this is what we have in place
and this is how we can measure".


600
0:29:21,767 --> 0:29:25,233
Are the elements that can
actually drive up these levels,


601
0:29:25,233 --> 0:29:30,733
such as the wind, the
water, the river--I mean,


602
0:29:30,733 --> 0:29:32,967
maybe I'm looking at it a
little differently, but I'm


603
0:29:32,967 --> 0:29:36,2
looking at it critically now
and I have this question.


604
0:29:36,2 --> 0:29:41,767
Since we're sitting on the
Mahomet Aquifer, right--the


605
0:29:41,767 --> 0:29:45,533
largest body of fresh water in
the country--could any release


606
0:29:45,533 --> 0:29:49,833
reach that source of water and
what would be the effect?


607
0:29:49,833 --> 0:29:51,933
(Mr. Craig). 
Yeah, if you have a meltdown


608
0:29:51,933 --> 0:29:54,433
it's definitely going to
cause a serious issue.


609
0:29:54,433 --> 0:29:58,6
If you have a leak in the
suppression containment then it


610
0:29:58,6 --> 0:30:1,8
gets into the water system and
then we're all drinking it,


611
0:30:1,8 --> 0:30:5,367
but it's not just us that
is going to be impacted,


612
0:30:5,367 --> 0:30:10,267
it's going to be all vegetation
from the ground level.


613
0:30:10,267 --> 0:30:14,1
Atmospherically, you have
heat that's billowing should


614
0:30:14,1 --> 0:30:15,9
a disaster occur and then what


615
0:30:15,9 --> 0:30:18,9
happens is--we're
surrounded by winds.


616
0:30:18,9 --> 0:30:23,433
(Dr. Collins).
Absolutely, with flat.


617
0:30:23,433 --> 0:30:25,567
(Mr. Craig).
And so all that radiation


618
0:30:25,567 --> 0:30:29,4
would transfer quickly,
especially with storms.


619
0:30:29,4 --> 0:30:31,167
And so radiation gets
into the clouds, you


620
0:30:31,167 --> 0:30:35,667
have a huge storm system
that naturally occurs,


621
0:30:35,667 --> 0:30:39,367
but then it starts dumping the
precipitation back into the soil


622
0:30:39,367 --> 0:30:41,633
and so contaminating it doubly.


623
0:30:41,633 --> 0:30:43,0
(Dr. Collins).
So that's my concern.


624
0:30:43,0 --> 0:30:46,733
When you say that, and we're
looking at a flat terrain here,


625
0:30:46,733 --> 0:30:48,867
and we can't really
control the wind.


626
0:30:48,867 --> 0:30:53,2
So then, therefore, I'm looking
at, if that's the case, are we


627
0:30:53,2 --> 0:30:59,633
prepared or do we have filters
in place of some sort or how are


628
0:30:59,633 --> 0:31:0,8
we preparing or
protecting ourselves?


629
0:31:0,8 --> 0:31:2,1
(Mr. Craig).
The big question is


630
0:31:2,1 --> 0:31:8,367
how much education has there
been to educate the community.


631
0:31:8,367 --> 0:31:9,3
That's the big question.


632
0:31:9,3 --> 0:31:11,733
I haven't heard anything,
I didn't even know that


633
0:31:11,733 --> 0:31:15,533
Illinois had nuclear power
plants until Fukushima.


634
0:31:15,533 --> 0:31:16,467
(Dr. Collins).
Really?


635
0:31:16,467 --> 0:31:17,367
(Mr. Craig).
Yeah.


636
0:31:17,367 --> 0:31:18,667
(Dr. Collins).
Okay, well I guess it may


637
0:31:18,667 --> 0:31:20,767
not come up in regular
conversation until


638
0:31:20,767 --> 0:31:21,33
something like that happens.


639
0:31:21,33 --> 0:31:22,1
(Mr. Craig).
You're right until something


640
0:31:22,1 --> 0:31:23,67
actually does
happen, so.


641
0:31:23,67 --> 0:31:24,2
(Dr. Collins).
Yeah but that's good to


642
0:31:24,2 --> 0:31:25,867
know though, it's
important to know.


643
0:31:25,867 --> 0:31:27,933
(Mr. Monken).
I think you're absolutely right.


644
0:31:27,933 --> 0:31:30,633
What it comes down to is
education and we run into this,


645
0:31:30,633 --> 0:31:32,2
it doesn't matter what
type of natural disaster


646
0:31:32,2 --> 0:31:33,367
you're talking about.


647
0:31:33,367 --> 0:31:35,1
Whether you're talking about
earthquakes--which people in


648
0:31:35,1 --> 0:31:37,4
Illinois typically just don't
understand, or how to respond


649
0:31:37,4 --> 0:31:39,9
to them or what they would do
in the case of an earthquake.


650
0:31:39,9 --> 0:31:42,233
The last thing you should do
in an earthquake is run out of


651
0:31:42,233 --> 0:31:44,5
a building because you have
to worry about the debris.


652
0:31:44,5 --> 0:31:46,1
That's something that a lot
of people just don't realize


653
0:31:46,1 --> 0:31:48,533
because people in Illinois
aren't used to it.


654
0:31:48,533 --> 0:31:50,4
But really I think the
educational piece is very


655
0:31:50,4 --> 0:31:53,933
important to understand what
types of radiation there are,


656
0:31:53,933 --> 0:31:55,633
how it is naturally occurring.


657
0:31:55,633 --> 0:31:57,8
You know radiation is released
from the soil when it rains--you


658
0:31:57,8 --> 0:32:1,333
know those types of things--but
I think the last part of it is


659
0:32:1,333 --> 0:32:5,567
information is the most critical
piece of what you're looking at.


660
0:32:5,567 --> 0:32:8,433
So if you look at a plant like
Fukushima, they don't have a


661
0:32:8,433 --> 0:32:10,767
system of sensors that are
actually around each of the


662
0:32:10,767 --> 0:32:12,433
plants like we do in Illinois.


663
0:32:12,433 --> 0:32:16,767
That is, we designed that system
specifically because of what


664
0:32:16,767 --> 0:32:18,267
happened at Three Mile Island.


665
0:32:18,267 --> 0:32:20,3
They didn't know how much
radiation, they didn't know


666
0:32:20,3 --> 0:32:23,133
which way it was headed,
they didn't know, you know,


667
0:32:23,133 --> 0:32:24,733
they could look at the wind
currents but they didn't


668
0:32:24,733 --> 0:32:27,533
understand exactly where
the radiation was going.


669
0:32:27,533 --> 0:32:29,633
And that's why we have the
system of sensors that we do


670
0:32:29,633 --> 0:32:32,2
and that's why we take the
samples that we do on a regular


671
0:32:32,2 --> 0:32:34,6
basis to make sure if we
can detect the patterns,


672
0:32:34,6 --> 0:32:38,667
we can detect the intensity
level, the saturation level,


673
0:32:38,667 --> 0:32:40,333
all those types of things,
which I think is the


674
0:32:40,333 --> 0:32:42,233
most important part of
responding to them.


675
0:32:42,233 --> 0:32:42,933
(Dr. Collins).
Okay, thank you,


676
0:32:42,933 --> 0:32:44,2
Dr. Daniels you wanted to say.


677
0:32:44,2 --> 0:32:45,4
(Dr. Daniels).
If I can give a little


678
0:32:45,4 --> 0:32:48,967
perspective here, I was
about 80 miles downwind


679
0:32:48,967 --> 0:32:50,767
of Three Mile Island
when it happened.


680
0:32:50,767 --> 0:32:54,33
And the first thing we did was
we put a detector out the


681
0:32:54,33 --> 0:32:57,467
window--a radiation
detector--and over


682
0:32:57,467 --> 0:33:0,467
the next three days the detector
went from background level


683
0:33:0,467 --> 0:33:2,833
to twice background
level and stayed there


684
0:33:2,833 --> 0:33:4,8
for about two weeks.


685
0:33:4,8 --> 0:33:9,0
Now how much danger is that,
just to put it in perspective,


686
0:33:9,0 --> 0:33:13,3
walking past the radiology
department in a hospital was


687
0:33:13,3 --> 0:33:15,1
more radiation than that--


688
0:33:15,1 --> 0:33:16,67
(Dr. Collins).
Oh wow.


689
0:33:16,67 --> 0:33:18,667
(Dr. Daniels). 
--for the average person


690
0:33:18,667 --> 0:33:24,567
and taking airplane flights you
get more radiation than that.


691
0:33:24,567 --> 0:33:25,5
(Dr. Collins).
Something else to


692
0:33:25,5 --> 0:33:27,9
worry about now, airplane
flights, oh my goodness.


693
0:33:27,9 --> 0:33:29,1
(Dr. Daniels).
Well the point is


694
0:33:29,1 --> 0:33:31,733
that the background
level is fairly low and


695
0:33:31,733 --> 0:33:36,4
when something as major as
Three Mile Island happens


696
0:33:36,4 --> 0:33:39,467
even at that, it wasn't
really contaminating all


697
0:33:39,467 --> 0:33:42,67
the atmosphere,
everywhere, all the time.


698
0:33:42,67 --> 0:33:46,9
It was a fairly major event but
at the same level it didn't


699
0:33:46,9 --> 0:33:51,567
really impact even 80 miles
away, it didn't change the


700
0:33:51,567 --> 0:33:54,8
way people had to
worry about radiation.


701
0:33:54,8 --> 0:33:55,933
[Dr. Baharlou].
Could you please explain


702
0:33:55,933 --> 0:34:1,67
half-life and dose limit,
[unclear audio].


703
0:34:1,67 --> 0:34:3,333
(Dr. Collins).
So he's asking about half-life


704
0:34:3,333 --> 0:34:5,7
for the listeners and
the viewers out there


705
0:34:5,7 --> 0:34:7,6
in the audience and
the TV audience.


706
0:34:7,6 --> 0:34:10,467
He wants you to explain, Dr.
Daniels, half-life.


707
0:34:10,467 --> 0:34:12,133
(Dr. Daniels).
Okay, so a radioactive


708
0:34:12,133 --> 0:34:17,1
material will give off so much
radiation as in terms of a rate,


709
0:34:17,1 --> 0:34:21,433
maybe some number 
of decays per second.


710
0:34:21,433 --> 0:34:26,8
Over time that material will
disappear, if you start with


711
0:34:26,8 --> 0:34:29,567
say a thousand grams
of something and


712
0:34:29,567 --> 0:34:34,33
it decays well it's
going away and it takes


713
0:34:34,33 --> 0:34:38,367
exactly one-half life for half
of that material to go away.


714
0:34:38,367 --> 0:34:42,967
But the interesting thing is
that then now you have 500 grams


715
0:34:42,967 --> 0:34:45,367
of the material and you
wait one-half life


716
0:34:45,367 --> 0:34:47,333
for that to go away too.


717
0:34:47,333 --> 0:34:49,67
It doesn't all go away
in two half lives,


718
0:34:49,67 --> 0:34:51,767
it only half goes away
at any given half life.


719
0:34:51,767 --> 0:34:53,2
(Dr. Baharlou).
Would you give an example


720
0:34:53,2 --> 0:34:56,0
of half-life of Uranium?


721
0:34:56,0 --> 0:34:58,267
(Dr. Daniels).
Half-life of Uranium--


722
0:34:58,267 --> 0:35:0,3
I believe it's in the
millions of years.


723
0:35:0,3 --> 0:35:5,533
(Dr. Baharlou).
404.5 million years so again,


724
0:35:5,533 --> 0:35:10,167
as I said, unleashed power of
the atom has changed everything.


725
0:35:10,167 --> 0:35:14,1
This is not like any other
thing, it's there for eternity


726
0:35:14,1 --> 0:35:16,733
so we have to be
concerned about that


727
0:35:16,733 --> 0:35:20,33
and would you also
speak about dose limit.


728
0:35:20,33 --> 0:35:21,33
(Dr. Collins).
Okay and what I'm


729
0:35:21,33 --> 0:35:23,2
going to ask you, sir, those
are great questions and


730
0:35:23,2 --> 0:35:24,833
I'd love for everyone
to make sure that they


731
0:35:24,833 --> 0:35:27,833
see you, so if you have a string
of questions please feel free to


732
0:35:27,833 --> 0:35:31,633
go to the microphone
so we can have that.


733
0:35:31,633 --> 0:35:32,8
(Dr. Collins).
Okay very good,


734
0:35:32,8 --> 0:35:37,533
I just wanted to make sure,
very good thank you, okay.


735
0:35:37,533 --> 0:35:38,3
Dr. Daniels, please.


736
0:35:38,3 --> 0:35:39,833
(Dr. Daniels).
Well this is probably


737
0:35:39,833 --> 0:35:44,133
more like John's specialty
than mine but again


738
0:35:44,133 --> 0:35:46,967
we measure how much
radiation you take in and


739
0:35:46,967 --> 0:35:51,167
the more radiation you get, the
more dangerous it's going to be.


740
0:35:51,167 --> 0:35:58,233
But typically the IEMA and the
NRC have set limits of how much


741
0:35:58,233 --> 0:36:1,333
the public can get and how much
workers in the industry can get


742
0:36:1,333 --> 0:36:3,933
and various levels
that that can be and


743
0:36:3,933 --> 0:36:5,9
they're in the
millirem I believe.


744
0:36:5,9 --> 0:36:6,967
(Mr. Monken).
That's right.


745
0:36:6,967 --> 0:36:8,533
(Dr. Daniels).
So I'll let you talk about that.


746
0:36:8,533 --> 0:36:9,6
(Mr. Monken).
Absolutely, yeah so


747
0:36:9,6 --> 0:36:11,533
the maximum as I
mentioned before


748
0:36:11,533 --> 0:36:14,233
when we had detected the iodine
131, which is what everybody


749
0:36:14,233 --> 0:36:17,667
has been picking up as a result
of the disaster in Fukushima.


750
0:36:17,667 --> 0:36:21,4
Ultimately we're looking at it
is in the millirem so we're at


751
0:36:21,4 --> 0:36:24,733
the point, what we're detecting
right now is one-two thousandth


752
0:36:24,733 --> 0:36:28,1
of the level that would be
necessary to actually have


753
0:36:28,1 --> 0:36:31,433
an impact on public health
in any way, shape or form.


754
0:36:31,433 --> 0:36:33,733
It would actually cross the
threshold of the dose level


755
0:36:33,733 --> 0:36:35,733
that the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission would say


756
0:36:35,733 --> 0:36:37,9
you have something to
be concerned about.


757
0:36:37,9 --> 0:36:39,567
So certainly not to be
taken lightly by any


758
0:36:39,567 --> 0:36:41,533
stretch of the imagination.


759
0:36:41,533 --> 0:36:44,3
That being said it's
also important from an


760
0:36:44,3 --> 0:36:46,467
educational perspective to
understand the orders in


761
0:36:46,467 --> 0:36:48,33
magnitude of where we are.


762
0:36:48,33 --> 0:36:53,567
It took us about two-and-a-half
days of testing one sample to


763
0:36:53,567 --> 0:36:57,467
actually detect the iodine 131
and you'll probably vouch for


764
0:36:57,467 --> 0:37:0,4
the fact that you would never
put a sample in something


765
0:37:0,4 --> 0:37:2,4
for two-and-a-half
days to find it.


766
0:37:2,4 --> 0:37:4,2
If it's not detectable
and something you can do


767
0:37:4,2 --> 0:37:6,8
within a few hours it's
something that's at such a


768
0:37:6,8 --> 0:37:9,467
low level that you wouldn't
even be concerned about.


769
0:37:9,467 --> 0:37:10,8
(Dr. Collins).
Okay great, thank you gentlemen.


770
0:37:10,8 --> 0:37:12,867
We have a question from the
audience, ma'am if you would


771
0:37:12,867 --> 0:37:15,6
just step right up to the mic,
there you go.


772
0:37:15,6 --> 0:37:17,8
(Female Speaker).
Yes, my name is [unclear audio]


773
0:37:17,8 --> 0:37:22,133
I'm an EIU staff and a current
mother of two EIU students.


774
0:37:22,133 --> 0:37:24,467
I got a question
regarding to information


775
0:37:24,467 --> 0:37:27,5
that I did receive
a while back,


776
0:37:27,5 --> 0:37:30,767
The gentleman here said
that the radiation is


777
0:37:30,767 --> 0:37:34,467
dissipated as it travels from
Japan to the United States.


778
0:37:34,467 --> 0:37:38,133
What about the merchandise that
is coming currently from Japan


779
0:37:38,133 --> 0:37:41,5
such as vehicles, which I've
been told that plutonium could


780
0:37:41,5 --> 0:37:46,133
get into the vehicles and
the seats and everywhere


781
0:37:46,133 --> 0:37:48,5
and that stays there
for a very long time.


782
0:37:48,5 --> 0:37:51,567
We have a lot of merchandise
coming currently from Japan.


783
0:37:51,567 --> 0:37:54,467
How do you prevent all that
merchandise and how does


784
0:37:54,467 --> 0:37:57,367
corporate America deal
with that loss of money.


785
0:37:57,367 --> 0:37:59,133
What are they doing with that
merchandise supposed to


786
0:37:59,133 --> 0:38:0,6
arrive in the United States and


787
0:38:0,6 --> 0:38:4,933
it's already contaminated with
plutonium and other chemicals?


788
0:38:4,933 --> 0:38:5,867
(Dr. Collins).
That's a great question,


789
0:38:5,867 --> 0:38:7,367
it is global isn't it.


790
0:38:7,367 --> 0:38:9,5
We have to look at things
outside of state lines.


791
0:38:9,5 --> 0:38:12,167
(Mr. Craig). 
One of the things is that,


792
0:38:12,167 --> 0:38:16,67
I buy rice, big bags of rice
and I've been concerned.


793
0:38:16,67 --> 0:38:18,233
The first thing that comes
to mind is how long ago


794
0:38:18,233 --> 0:38:22,8
was this harvested and how long
did it sit in a warehouse and


795
0:38:22,8 --> 0:38:28,3
I'm guessing that it's okay
but the production of rice is


796
0:38:28,3 --> 0:38:31,633
probably going to be a
critical factor in the future


797
0:38:31,633 --> 0:38:36,4
especially with other
vegetation that we eat.


798
0:38:36,4 --> 0:38:39,4
But as far as products
are concerned I--


799
0:38:39,4 --> 0:38:40,867
(Mr. Monken).
Yeah, I can tell you


800
0:38:40,867 --> 0:38:42,4
ultimately and this
is actually kind of


801
0:38:42,4 --> 0:38:45,167
interesting because there
is a reason why all hazards


802
0:38:45,167 --> 0:38:47,167
cover everything from
man-made to natural.


803
0:38:47,167 --> 0:38:50,233
In the post 9/11 world we
actually have a much better


804
0:38:50,233 --> 0:38:53,233
developed system of radiation
detection as it applies


805
0:38:53,233 --> 0:38:55,667
to customs and
border protection.


806
0:38:55,667 --> 0:38:58,467
So if you're looking at Japan
as an example, they actually


807
0:38:58,467 --> 0:39:1,633
import 60 percent of all the
food the country consumes,


808
0:39:1,633 --> 0:39:3,4
simply because there's
not enough space and


809
0:39:3,4 --> 0:39:5,7
there's 123 million people.


810
0:39:5,7 --> 0:39:8,33
So the exports from a
food perspective are


811
0:39:8,33 --> 0:39:11,133
actually extremely low from
Japan as it stands anyway.


812
0:39:11,133 --> 0:39:14,3
That being said, ultimately
there are some very, very


813
0:39:14,3 --> 0:39:19,133
significant systems in place to
detect even small trace amounts


814
0:39:19,133 --> 0:39:24,367
of radiation on any passenger
plane, on any cargo plane,


815
0:39:24,367 --> 0:39:26,67
on any ship, or any vehicle


816
0:39:26,67 --> 0:39:28,233
that crosses an
international border.


817
0:39:28,233 --> 0:39:30,833
So nothing can really get into
the United States even with


818
0:39:30,833 --> 0:39:33,967
minor trace levels of radiation


819
0:39:33,967 --> 0:39:36,433
without being detected
immediately upon arrival.


820
0:39:36,433 --> 0:39:39,233
So people don't actually even
realize that planes that you're


821
0:39:39,233 --> 0:39:43,7
flying, if someone flies from
Narita to O'Hare, you don't even


822
0:39:43,7 --> 0:39:45,567
realize that that plane
is actually scanned


823
0:39:45,567 --> 0:39:49,67
for trace levels of radiation
as it comes into the airport.


824
0:39:49,67 --> 0:39:50,6
(Dr. Collins).
Even with that though


825
0:39:50,6 --> 0:39:53,4
there has to be or
there appears even


826
0:39:53,4 --> 0:39:56,767
when the news first broke
we saw a dip in the Dow


827
0:39:56,767 --> 0:40:0,5
and so there's going to be an
economic effect globally.


828
0:40:0,5 --> 0:40:2,633
Are we prepared for
something like that?


829
0:40:2,633 --> 0:40:7,767
Let's say it's great, we can
detect certain small levels on


830
0:40:7,767 --> 0:40:9,933
planes and modes
of transportation,


831
0:40:9,933 --> 0:40:13,967
but it can have an effect in the
way that our state is right now,


832
0:40:13,967 --> 0:40:18,267
it could really affect us harder
and deeper and more intensely


833
0:40:18,267 --> 0:40:20,733
than an earthquake if
we're not very careful.


834
0:40:20,733 --> 0:40:22,833
What do you think
about that assessment?


835
0:40:22,833 --> 0:40:23,633
(Mr. Monken).
I think it's a


836
0:40:23,633 --> 0:40:25,767
fantastic question simply
because right now even the


837
0:40:25,767 --> 0:40:28,3
estimated economic impact,
it's the world's third largest


838
0:40:28,3 --> 0:40:30,667
economy and you're talking
about an estimated


839
0:40:30,667 --> 0:40:34,867
economic impact of at
least $330 billion.


840
0:40:34,867 --> 0:40:37,833
That's just what Japan needs
in order to recover, that says


841
0:40:37,833 --> 0:40:41,8
nothing to the fact about the
total net value lost in world


842
0:40:41,8 --> 0:40:43,167
markets and things like
that when you have


843
0:40:43,167 --> 0:40:45,233
that type of impact.


844
0:40:45,233 --> 0:40:46,9
You can even strike it close
to home--Caterpillar,


845
0:40:46,9 --> 0:40:48,7
which is headquartered
in Peoria, Illinois,


846
0:40:48,7 --> 0:40:51,3
has five facilities in Japan.


847
0:40:51,3 --> 0:40:54,4
The question is whether or not
they can export what they


848
0:40:54,4 --> 0:40:56,233
continue to export because
that's actually the regional hub


849
0:40:56,233 --> 0:40:57,4
for Southeast Asia.


850
0:40:57,4 --> 0:41:1,733
So the economic impact I think
is going to be measured in a


851
0:41:1,733 --> 0:41:4,0
dollar figure that I don't
think any of us could possibly


852
0:41:4,0 --> 0:41:5,8
wrap our minds around.


853
0:41:5,8 --> 0:41:6,9
(Dr. Collins).
Ok, yeah.


854
0:41:6,9 --> 0:41:10,567
Well, okay, thank you
for those responses.


855
0:41:10,567 --> 0:41:13,0
I wanted to ask a question about
the reactors--I wanted to come


856
0:41:13,0 --> 0:41:15,433
back to that for just a moment.


857
0:41:15,433 --> 0:41:18,933
Because I believe in the
research it shows that they're


858
0:41:18,933 --> 0:41:21,533
close to 25 years
old, approximately.


859
0:41:21,533 --> 0:41:22,467
(Mr. Monken).
Actually, older.


860
0:41:22,467 --> 0:41:24,4
(Dr. Collins).
Older, okay.


861
0:41:24,4 --> 0:41:27,33
So my question, my
follow-up question is


862
0:41:27,33 --> 0:41:31,0
have there been measures
for improvement as far as


863
0:41:31,0 --> 0:41:32,2
they're getting a little old? 


864
0:41:32,2 --> 0:41:36,33
Have we started taking steps
to improve the defense?


865
0:41:36,33 --> 0:41:37,967
(Mr. Monken).
Yes, as I mentioned before


866
0:41:37,967 --> 0:41:40,0
briefly but I'll kind of
expand on right now,


867
0:41:40,0 --> 0:41:42,633
you mentioned the similarities
between the designs of some of


868
0:41:42,633 --> 0:41:44,8
the plants that we have here
in Illinois--specifically,


869
0:41:44,8 --> 0:41:47,1
you're talking about the two
reactors located at the Dresden


870
0:41:47,1 --> 0:41:50,1
plant and two reactors located
at the Quad Cities plant.


871
0:41:50,1 --> 0:41:54,467
And the similarities
are really most direct


872
0:41:54,467 --> 0:41:56,433
when you're looking at the
inner containment facility,


873
0:41:56,433 --> 0:41:58,367
which is the GE mark-1.


874
0:41:58,367 --> 0:42:0,7
The rest of the facility has
changed drastically over the


875
0:42:0,7 --> 0:42:2,767
course of time,
because ultimately


876
0:42:2,767 --> 0:42:4,867
significant improvements
have been made


877
0:42:4,867 --> 0:42:7,967
to each of those facilities
as technology has increased.


878
0:42:7,967 --> 0:42:10,367
So as the technology continues
to get better, which


879
0:42:10,367 --> 0:42:13,2
to a certain extent, we're kind
of in the middle of what some


880
0:42:13,2 --> 0:42:15,4
people would refer to as a
nuclear renaissance as far as


881
0:42:15,4 --> 0:42:20,33
the efficiency of nuclear power,
the capability to produce it--


882
0:42:20,33 --> 0:42:21,8
all those types of things--but
there hasn't been a nuclear


883
0:42:21,8 --> 0:42:25,3
power plant commission in the
United States in over 20 years.


884
0:42:25,3 --> 0:42:27,733
So what you're looking at is
plants like the Quad Cities


885
0:42:27,733 --> 0:42:30,9
and Dresden--Dresden just
celebrated 40 years this year,


886
0:42:30,9 --> 0:42:34,167
so it's a 40-year-old
reactor right now.


887
0:42:34,167 --> 0:42:37,1
That being said, over that
span of time, significant


888
0:42:37,1 --> 0:42:39,967
improvements have been made to
the facility to make it more


889
0:42:39,967 --> 0:42:42,967
efficient, to make it better at
what it does, to make it safer


890
0:42:42,967 --> 0:42:45,567
--all of those things have
been done over time.


891
0:42:45,567 --> 0:42:48,433
Now the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission had basically,


892
0:42:48,433 --> 0:42:49,633
when they commissioned a
new plant they gave them


893
0:42:49,633 --> 0:42:51,5
a license for 40 years.


894
0:42:51,5 --> 0:42:54,833
That 40-year license expired
at Dresden this last year


895
0:42:54,833 --> 0:42:57,233
and was renewed for
an additional 20.


896
0:42:57,233 --> 0:42:58,9
The expectation is that
the Quad Cities will get


897
0:42:58,9 --> 0:43:1,3
an additional 20 years
next year, but really


898
0:43:1,3 --> 0:43:6,167
the youngest power plant in the
state of Illinois is at Clinton.


899
0:43:6,167 --> 0:43:8,833
So, as it happens, the
closest one to us is the


900
0:43:8,833 --> 0:43:13,33
youngest facility in the state
of Illinois, but youngest is


901
0:43:13,33 --> 0:43:15,467
kind of a dubious honor
at this point because


902
0:43:15,467 --> 0:43:18,6
really you're talking
it's over 30 years old.


903
0:43:18,6 --> 0:43:21,567
So really you're
looking at a lot of plants now


904
0:43:21,567 --> 0:43:27,967
that have been on line for
several decades.


905
0:43:27,967 --> 0:43:31,33
(Dr. Collins).
We've talked to Chief Goodwin


906
0:43:31,33 --> 0:43:33,3
and asked his
opinion and all the


907
0:43:33,3 --> 0:43:37,633
wonderful measures that he has
in place that appear to be,


908
0:43:37,633 --> 0:43:40,367
that can be effective if
something were to happen.


909
0:43:40,367 --> 0:43:42,333
Let's make it even simpler.


910
0:43:42,333 --> 0:43:46,867
If we were to have to power
down a plant, are we prepared


911
0:43:46,867 --> 0:43:52,1
for that and what measures
would have to be in place


912
0:43:52,1 --> 0:43:55,3
--are they in place if we just
needed to quickly power down?


913
0:43:55,3 --> 0:44:0,733
We see a lot of travesties that
have occurred because the


914
0:44:0,733 --> 0:44:3,667
safety elements didn't
take on because they


915
0:44:3,667 --> 0:44:6,333
weren't able to power
down very quickly.


916
0:44:6,333 --> 0:44:10,2
So where are we in that
since we have 10?


917
0:44:10,2 --> 0:44:12,233
Where are we as far as the
powering down element?


918
0:44:12,233 --> 0:44:14,633
(Mr. Monken).
Sure, yeah, ultimately


919
0:44:14,633 --> 0:44:17,3
the plants themselves are
actually designed to respond


920
0:44:17,3 --> 0:44:22,533
to an emergency by shutting
down, but saying it's


921
0:44:22,533 --> 0:44:24,233
shutting down is definitely not
flipping the light switch.


922
0:44:24,233 --> 0:44:25,4
[panel laughter].


923
0:44:25,4 --> 0:44:27,167
I can tell you that it is
significantly more complicated


924
0:44:27,167 --> 0:44:28,533
than that process.


925
0:44:28,533 --> 0:44:30,133
(Dr. Collins). 
And how long of a process is it?


926
0:44:30,133 --> 0:44:31,467
(Mr. Monken).
It's a very long process really


927
0:44:31,467 --> 0:44:33,33
in a lot of respects because
what you're looking at is


928
0:44:33,33 --> 0:44:37,433
you've got whether or not it's
actually actively functioning


929
0:44:37,433 --> 0:44:40,33
as a reactor as versus
whether or not there's still


930
0:44:40,33 --> 0:44:42,633
radioactivity coming from
the inner core and the


931
0:44:42,633 --> 0:44:44,8
spent fuel pool and that's
kind of two different things.


932
0:44:44,8 --> 0:44:46,933
So if you look at the earthquake
that we had in Illinois


933
0:44:46,933 --> 0:44:49,5
just a couple years ago, which
was a very low magnitude,


934
0:44:49,5 --> 0:44:52,633
that actually caused the plants
to shut down simply because if


935
0:44:52,633 --> 0:44:54,633
there's seismic activity
in the immediate area,


936
0:44:54,633 --> 0:44:57,133
they'll automatically
shut down right away.


937
0:44:57,133 --> 0:45:2,133
But what we're talking about
too is, you know like I said,


938
0:45:2,133 --> 0:45:4,4
it's not like flipping
off the light switch.


939
0:45:4,4 --> 0:45:6,4
The other thing you need to be
concerned with--and this is what


940
0:45:6,4 --> 0:45:8,667
they saw in Japan--is, as I
mentioned before, when you pull


941
0:45:8,667 --> 0:45:11,233
that spent nuclear fuel out,
which is something that was


942
0:45:11,233 --> 0:45:14,5
raised, and very, very
accurately raised


943
0:45:14,5 --> 0:45:17,933
by the audience, when you pull
those spent fuel rods out,


944
0:45:17,933 --> 0:45:21,167
they're still radioactive
--very, very radioactive.


945
0:45:21,167 --> 0:45:23,367
And it takes a significant
amount of time for them to


946
0:45:23,367 --> 0:45:27,567
ultimately cool down where
the atomic reactions are not


947
0:45:27,567 --> 0:45:30,267
happening with the frequency
or at the rate that puts out


948
0:45:30,267 --> 0:45:32,967
the heat and radioactivity that
actually causes the problem.


949
0:45:32,967 --> 0:45:34,967
That takes 12 to 15 years.


950
0:45:34,967 --> 0:45:36,6
(Dr. Collins).
Wow.


951
0:45:36,6 --> 0:45:37,533
(Mr. Monken).
To put it in perspective,


952
0:45:37,533 --> 0:45:39,6
when they have a
spent fuel pool


953
0:45:39,6 --> 0:45:41,533
ultimately before it can
actually be transferred to


954
0:45:41,533 --> 0:45:44,1
a low-level nuclear waste
site, it takes about


955
0:45:44,1 --> 0:45:47,767
12 to 15 years cooling
down in water in order


956
0:45:47,767 --> 0:45:50,767
to actually slow down the
reactions enough that you're


957
0:45:50,767 --> 0:45:53,667
taking away the harmful reaction
that you're getting.


958
0:45:53,667 --> 0:45:56,467
The first step though is making
sure that the plant itself is


959
0:45:56,467 --> 0:46:0,133
shut down because there are
other issues that you can run


960
0:46:0,133 --> 0:46:3,833
into if the plant is still fully
functioning at the time.


961
0:46:3,833 --> 0:46:5,633
(Mr. Craig).
How much of the shut down


962
0:46:5,633 --> 0:46:9,6
process is automated
versus human-controlled?


963
0:46:9,6 --> 0:46:11,767
(Mr. Monken).
Really, the human element


964
0:46:11,767 --> 0:46:13,767
is kind of the redundant
element to it.


965
0:46:13,767 --> 0:46:16,5
Most of it happens
automatically,


966
0:46:16,5 --> 0:46:17,8
and it's designed that
way to make sure that


967
0:46:17,8 --> 0:46:21,567
under no circumstances is it
possible for--it cannot solely


968
0:46:21,567 --> 0:46:26,933
rely on human error as
you accurately identified.


969
0:46:26,933 --> 0:46:30,9
The point is there is an
automatic system that's in place


970
0:46:30,9 --> 0:46:32,467
and then there's multiple
redundant human systems


971
0:46:32,467 --> 0:46:34,233
that are in place.


972
0:46:34,233 --> 0:46:35,933
So you have the individuals who
are physically at the plant,


973
0:46:35,933 --> 0:46:38,4
then you also have agencies like
IEMA who are actually monitoring


974
0:46:38,4 --> 0:46:39,667
those plants, that
actually have the


975
0:46:39,667 --> 0:46:41,8
capability to do
something as well.


976
0:46:41,8 --> 0:46:45,0
So ultimately it's, you know, if
you look at an aircraft, the


977
0:46:45,0 --> 0:46:47,367
only way you can actually
fly an aircraft is that it


978
0:46:47,367 --> 0:46:50,0
actually has to have six
redundant autopilot systems


979
0:46:50,0 --> 0:46:52,5
on a commercial
passenger airliner. 


980
0:46:52,5 --> 0:46:54,467
We take a very similar model.


981
0:46:54,467 --> 0:46:58,2
You have to have multiple layers
of redundant capability to


982
0:46:58,2 --> 0:46:59,733
shut down those plants
to make sure that


983
0:46:59,733 --> 0:47:2,767
under no circumstances
could it basically run wild.


984
0:47:2,767 --> 0:47:4,833
(Dr. Collins).
Okay, what I would like to do


985
0:47:4,833 --> 0:47:8,167
is have Dr. Daniels make his
comment then we're going to


986
0:47:8,167 --> 0:47:12,33
take a short break to come back
with some closing statements.


987
0:47:12,33 --> 0:47:15,367
And I had one more serious
question to ask before we have


988
0:47:15,367 --> 0:47:16,967
the closing statements,
but Dr. Daniels--


989
0:47:16,967 --> 0:47:19,1
(Dr. Daniels). 
I have another question.


990
0:47:19,1 --> 0:47:25,33
Going forward you have new fuel
coming in all the time and it


991
0:47:25,33 --> 0:47:27,533
takes 15 years to get
rid of a piece of fuel.


992
0:47:27,533 --> 0:47:31,667
How much do they change over
the rods and, therefore,


993
0:47:31,667 --> 0:47:33,233
how much is piling up?


994
0:47:33,233 --> 0:47:34,8
(Mr. Monken). 
A lot of it just depends on,


995
0:47:34,8 --> 0:47:37,433
right now what you're looking at
is, you're looking at roughly


996
0:47:37,433 --> 0:47:40,8
over 9,000 pounds of low-level
nuclear waste that's


997
0:47:40,8 --> 0:47:43,533
being stored somewhere in
the state of Illinois


998
0:47:43,533 --> 0:47:44,967
right now at each
of the plants.


999
0:47:44,967 --> 0:47:46,9
So, it's distributed between
each of the plants,


1000
0:47:46,9 --> 0:47:48,9
even if it's inactive like
the Zion plant that's


1001
0:47:48,9 --> 0:47:50,833
on the north shore of Chicago.


1002
0:47:50,833 --> 0:47:54,33
So it's a great question because
that's a national concern.


1003
0:47:54,33 --> 0:47:55,333
That's not just an
Illinois concern,


1004
0:47:55,333 --> 0:47:57,467
that's a national concern
because ultimately you


1005
0:47:57,467 --> 0:48:1,367
cannot use those nuclear
rods into perpetuity.


1006
0:48:1,367 --> 0:48:4,133
At some point, the level of
the reaction is going to drop


1007
0:48:4,133 --> 0:48:6,867
to the point where it's not
efficient as a power source.


1008
0:48:6,867 --> 0:48:10,8
So it's a constant process and
it varies from plant to plant


1009
0:48:10,8 --> 0:48:13,33
as far as how long they
run one set of rods


1010
0:48:13,33 --> 0:48:15,433
and then how long it's been
since they've been taken out.


1011
0:48:15,433 --> 0:48:16,967
I mean, at any one of
the plants you can see


1012
0:48:16,967 --> 0:48:19,167
the spent nuclear fuel
pools contain rods that


1013
0:48:19,167 --> 0:48:21,6
have been out for varying
lengths of time.


1014
0:48:21,6 --> 0:48:24,167
The real question that has to be
asked at a national level is the


1015
0:48:24,167 --> 0:48:26,2
Yucca Mountain facility
was supposed to be the


1016
0:48:26,2 --> 0:48:28,967
solution for low-level
nuclear waste nationally.


1017
0:48:28,967 --> 0:48:33,233
Unfortunately, it's not open, so
what's happening now is each of


1018
0:48:33,233 --> 0:48:35,433
the states are
continuing to store low-level


1019
0:48:35,433 --> 0:48:39,3
nuclear waste on site at
each of the power plants.


1020
0:48:39,3 --> 0:48:41,67
That's what Illinois
has to do right now,


1021
0:48:41,67 --> 0:48:42,7
until a permanent
solution is reached.


1022
0:48:42,7 --> 0:48:43,833
(Dr. Collins).
Okay.


1023
0:48:43,833 --> 0:48:44,967
[audience member speaking].


1024
0:48:44,967 --> 0:48:48,833
(Dr. Collins).
Hold that thought one moment.


1025
0:48:48,833 --> 0:48:50,0
Hold that one moment, sir.


1026
0:48:50,0 --> 0:48:51,0
We're going to come back
with that question.


1027
0:48:51,0 --> 0:48:52,433
We're going to take
a quick break with


1028
0:48:52,433 --> 0:48:55,567
"Issues and Attitudes:
Nuclear Safety in Illinois".


1029
0:48:55,567 --> 0:48:59,467
[no dialogue].


1030
0:48:59,467 --> 0:49:0,533
(Dr. Collins).
Great, welcome back to


1031
0:49:0,533 --> 0:49:4,3
"Issues and Attitudes:
Nuclear Safety in Illinois".


1032
0:49:4,3 --> 0:49:7,467
The final question before we
have our closing statements--


1033
0:49:7,467 --> 0:49:10,2
I wanted to ask
about the "what if".


1034
0:49:10,2 --> 0:49:11,533
We've been talking
a lot hypothetically


1035
0:49:11,533 --> 0:49:13,133
because we have to.


1036
0:49:13,133 --> 0:49:16,167
We're fortunate that we haven't
had some of the tragedies that


1037
0:49:16,167 --> 0:49:18,833
have occurred in
other countries.


1038
0:49:18,833 --> 0:49:22,133
But I want to ask about, we've
talked about the environment,


1039
0:49:22,133 --> 0:49:24,867
we've talked about air supply,
we've talked about water supply.


1040
0:49:24,867 --> 0:49:29,2
What about the actual evacuation
of movement of people?


1041
0:49:29,2 --> 0:49:32,867
And what do they do,
and what can they do?


1042
0:49:32,867 --> 0:49:34,9
Not necessarily what can they
do on an individual basis,


1043
0:49:34,9 --> 0:49:38,633
but do we have plans and
measures in place to actually


1044
0:49:38,633 --> 0:49:41,967
get the word out to the
people, educate the audience


1045
0:49:41,967 --> 0:49:46,9
and actually get
them out safely?


1046
0:49:46,9 --> 0:49:47,8
(Mr. Monken).
I would say


1047
0:49:47,8 --> 0:49:49,4
the closer you live to
a nuclear power plant,


1048
0:49:49,4 --> 0:49:51,3
the more you actually know
about this process because


1049
0:49:51,3 --> 0:49:54,8
there's actually a requirement
placed on how much information


1050
0:49:54,8 --> 0:49:56,567
we need to put out,
and it's actually a


1051
0:49:56,567 --> 0:49:58,4
shared responsibility
with Exelon who,


1052
0:49:58,4 --> 0:50:0,433
as you mentioned earlier,
owns the plants.


1053
0:50:0,433 --> 0:50:2,33
But ultimately, I think
you're hitting on


1054
0:50:2,33 --> 0:50:5,133
the critical piece here which
is there are a lot of factors


1055
0:50:5,133 --> 0:50:8,433
that we cannot control
that we have to monitor.


1056
0:50:8,433 --> 0:50:10,567
The human element is
the only factor that


1057
0:50:10,567 --> 0:50:13,2
we actually can control, which
is the evacuation plans


1058
0:50:13,2 --> 0:50:16,367
and everything else that we have
because it can be probably


1059
0:50:16,367 --> 0:50:18,133
even more easily
carried by people


1060
0:50:18,133 --> 0:50:21,33
than it can be by, really,
natural elements.


1061
0:50:21,33 --> 0:50:22,233
(Mr. Craig). 
You know, most of the residents


1062
0:50:22,233 --> 0:50:26,767
here In Illinois are not used
to evacuation on mass.


1063
0:50:26,767 --> 0:50:29,733
If I can ask the audience
a simple question,


1064
0:50:29,733 --> 0:50:32,767
how many of you know
what to do in a tornado?


1065
0:50:32,767 --> 0:50:37,567
Okay, how many of you know
what to do in an earthquake?


1066
0:50:37,567 --> 0:50:44,6
What do you know how to
do for a nuclear reaction?


1067
0:50:44,6 --> 0:50:50,233
Yeah, one.


1068
0:50:50,233 --> 0:50:52,133
But, that was my key point.


1069
0:50:52,133 --> 0:50:58,333
We all know about tornadoes but
a nuclear reaction or disaster,


1070
0:50:58,333 --> 0:50:59,633
we don't.


1071
0:50:59,633 --> 0:51:1,1
(Dr. Collins).
Okay, that is a different--


1072
0:51:1,1 --> 0:51:15,8
(Male speaker)
[unclear audio]. 


1073
0:51:15,8 --> 0:51:16,433
(Dr. Collins).
Okay, sir, I'm sorry.


1074
0:51:16,433 --> 0:51:18,467
If you'd like to ask--we can't
hear you at all because you're


1075
0:51:18,467 --> 0:51:23,67
in the audience--If you'd like
to stand to the microphone,


1076
0:51:23,67 --> 0:51:26,267
if we have time we'll get
to that before we close.


1077
0:51:26,267 --> 0:51:31,367
That would be fine, but
we just can't hear you.


1078
0:51:31,367 --> 0:51:33,733
(Mr. Monken). 
That evacuation plan is actually


1079
0:51:33,733 --> 0:51:35,967
what we spend the most amount
of time actually practicing and


1080
0:51:35,967 --> 0:51:37,8
the Chief hit the nail
on the head, which is,


1081
0:51:37,8 --> 0:51:39,567
through the mutual aid systems
that we have throughout


1082
0:51:39,567 --> 0:51:42,6
the state of Illinois, that's
exactly what we drill.


1083
0:51:42,6 --> 0:51:44,67
It's what we would
need to do because


1084
0:51:44,67 --> 0:51:46,1
you can only educate
the public so much.


1085
0:51:46,1 --> 0:51:48,833
At a certain point it actually
takes the involvement of your


1086
0:51:48,833 --> 0:51:51,3
public safety entities, whether
it's fire, EMT, or police.


1087
0:51:51,3 --> 0:51:54,33
Those are the people that we
train on a regular basis


1088
0:51:54,33 --> 0:51:56,467
and we have very, very
detailed evacuation plans for


1089
0:51:56,467 --> 0:51:58,133
every area of the state.


1090
0:51:58,133 --> 0:51:59,967
(Dr. Collins).
Okay, thank you.


1091
0:51:59,967 --> 0:52:1,967
And let's move to
Chief Goodwin,


1092
0:52:1,967 --> 0:52:6,0
who has offered some really
valuable information.


1093
0:52:6,0 --> 0:52:8,4
I wanted him to have a moment
to make a closing statement,


1094
0:52:8,4 --> 0:52:10,467
sir, before we move on.


1095
0:52:10,467 --> 0:52:12,533
(Mr. Goodwin). 
We have a specialized team


1096
0:52:12,533 --> 0:52:14,767
for this part of the state
as far as HAZMAT and


1097
0:52:14,767 --> 0:52:16,433
technical rescue but as
far as HAZMAT, if we do


1098
0:52:16,433 --> 0:52:19,7
get into the nuclear side of
it, my second phone call is


1099
0:52:19,7 --> 0:52:22,67
going to be to IEMA
for their assistance


1100
0:52:22,67 --> 0:52:23,967
because they're the
experts in it.


1101
0:52:23,967 --> 0:52:26,367
But as far as the evacuation,
we talked about that.


1102
0:52:26,367 --> 0:52:28,667
Charleston, we have an
evacuation plan in place,


1103
0:52:28,667 --> 0:52:31,167
so we try to prepare
for everything.


1104
0:52:31,167 --> 0:52:33,333
What's going to
happen, who knows,


1105
0:52:33,333 --> 0:52:35,933
but we try to prepare for
the worst that we know of.


1106
0:52:35,933 --> 0:52:37,333
(Dr. Collins).
Thank you, sir.


1107
0:52:37,333 --> 0:52:40,567
Dr. Daniels.


1108
0:52:40,567 --> 0:52:42,167
(Dr. Daniels).
Radiation is something that


1109
0:52:42,167 --> 0:52:44,867
you can't see, you can't
smell, you can't feel,


1110
0:52:44,867 --> 0:52:48,233
but the key to
protecting yourself and


1111
0:52:48,233 --> 0:52:52,667
understanding the whole thing is
learning and education and we


1112
0:52:52,667 --> 0:52:56,367
need to understand, have the
masses understand, exactly what


1113
0:52:56,367 --> 0:52:58,133
the dangers are and
exactly how bad they are


1114
0:52:58,133 --> 0:52:59,9
or how not so bad they are.


1115
0:52:59,9 --> 0:53:0,833
(Dr. Collins).
Okay, great, thank you.


1116
0:53:0,833 --> 0:53:1,7
Professor Craig.


1117
0:53:1,7 --> 0:53:5,2
(Mr. Craig).
Nuclear plants are necessary and


1118
0:53:5,2 --> 0:53:8,167
they're very efficient--more
efficient than wind power and


1119
0:53:8,167 --> 0:53:14,533
solar panels and so it's
necessary, but again education


1120
0:53:14,533 --> 0:53:16,8
and understanding what to do


1121
0:53:16,8 --> 0:53:19,9
in the event of a
situation is needed.


1122
0:53:19,9 --> 0:53:22,367
(Dr. Collins).
Great and Mr. Monken.


1123
0:53:22,367 --> 0:53:24,1
(Mr. Monken).
Really what I'd like to


1124
0:53:24,1 --> 0:53:26,133
really just kind of say about
what we have in Illinois is


1125
0:53:26,133 --> 0:53:28,5
that I think the citizens of
Illinois should be extremely


1126
0:53:28,5 --> 0:53:31,0
proud of the system that
we actually have here.


1127
0:53:31,0 --> 0:53:34,0
In many respects, it's unique
nationally and unique globally.


1128
0:53:34,0 --> 0:53:36,233
Representatives from 22
countries, including Japan,


1129
0:53:36,233 --> 0:53:37,533
have been to
Illinois to see how


1130
0:53:37,533 --> 0:53:40,867
we do our nuclear
safety program.


1131
0:53:40,867 --> 0:53:43,533
While it is really the best in
the country-- incredibly well


1132
0:53:43,533 --> 0:53:48,4
developed and really better than
anything anyone else has--


1133
0:53:48,4 --> 0:53:51,0
we always have to
see these disasters


1134
0:53:51,0 --> 0:53:53,367
as an opportunity to
improve our plans.


1135
0:53:53,367 --> 0:53:55,467
There's never a finish line.


1136
0:53:55,467 --> 0:53:59,3
There's never a point at which
we are done making our plans--


1137
0:53:59,3 --> 0:54:1,33
how we're going to evacuate
people, what types of


1138
0:54:1,33 --> 0:54:4,3
scenarios we need to be prepared
for--and that's what these types


1139
0:54:4,3 --> 0:54:7,133
of events, that's why they're
so important to us is that


1140
0:54:7,133 --> 0:54:10,3
we have to take a look
back, rework our plans and


1141
0:54:10,3 --> 0:54:13,3
make sure that everything is
as accurate as it can be.


1142
0:54:13,3 --> 0:54:15,133
(Dr. Collins).
Okay, that's wonderful.


1143
0:54:15,133 --> 0:54:17,733
I wanted to also add to the
education aspect--it is


1144
0:54:17,733 --> 0:54:21,167
important to be educated and I'm
so happy, happy and pleased


1145
0:54:21,167 --> 0:54:24,433
to see everyone here who wanted
to come out and ask questions


1146
0:54:24,433 --> 0:54:27,567
and hear some of the answers
and actually continue


1147
0:54:27,567 --> 0:54:29,667
and participate
in the dialogue.


1148
0:54:29,667 --> 0:54:33,6
I also want to mention
April 28, right?


1149
0:54:33,6 --> 0:54:36,3
IEMA is having the Great
Central U.S. Shakeout--


1150
0:54:36,3 --> 0:54:38,9
getting prepared
for earthquakes.


1151
0:54:38,9 --> 0:54:40,233
That's going to be going on.


1152
0:54:40,233 --> 0:54:42,6
60,000 Illinois residents
have already registered to


1153
0:54:42,6 --> 0:54:45,0
participate in an
earthquake drill,


1154
0:54:45,0 --> 0:54:46,4
so we're really
pleased about that.


1155
0:54:46,4 --> 0:54:48,6
So that's one part of
getting educated.


1156
0:54:48,6 --> 0:54:51,533
Another part of getting educated
is having guests such as


1157
0:54:51,533 --> 0:54:54,4
Professor Craig--thank you
so much for being here;


1158
0:54:54,4 --> 0:54:56,133
Mr. Monken--thank
you so much;


1159
0:54:56,133 --> 0:54:58,133
Dr. Daniels and Chief Goodwin,


1160
0:54:58,133 --> 0:54:59,767
thank you so much
for being here.
