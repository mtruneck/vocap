1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:16,59



2
0:0:16,59 --> 0:0:17,488
MALE SPEAKER 1: So there's a guy
lying in bed, a Catholic,


3
0:0:17,488 --> 0:0:18,404
Celtic fan.


4
0:0:18,404 --> 0:0:19,32
He's lying in bed.


5
0:0:19,32 --> 0:0:20,656
He's totally dying, on his
last legs and that.


6
0:0:20,656 --> 0:0:24,85
All his family ask him,
any last requests?


7
0:0:24,85 --> 0:0:25,33
[INAUDIBLE].


8
0:0:25,33 --> 0:0:29,17
And the guy's like, aye, I
wanna become a Proddy.


9
0:0:29,17 --> 0:0:30,9
And the family are like, what?


10
0:0:30,9 --> 0:0:32,9
Excuse me, what?


11
0:0:32,9 --> 0:0:34,72
And he says, honestly, that's
really what I want to do.


12
0:0:34,72 --> 0:0:35,87
So they get a minister in.


13
0:0:35,87 --> 0:0:37,12
The minister comes in.


14
0:0:37,12 --> 0:0:38,5
He coverts him to a
Protestant, and a


15
0:0:38,5 --> 0:0:39,28
Rangers fan, and that.


16
0:0:39,28 --> 0:0:42,195
And the family are like, Dad,
why would want to do that?


17
0:0:42,195 --> 0:0:44,9
Because see, if I die, that's
one less Proddy bastard to


18
0:0:44,9 --> 0:0:46,4
worry about, eh?


19
0:0:46,4 --> 0:0:48,84
[LAUGHTER]


20
0:0:48,84 --> 0:0:51,47
KEV KHARAS: In late winter,
2011, I traveled north from


21
0:0:51,47 --> 0:0:54,9
London to Glasgow to get an
up-to-date look at one of the


22
0:0:54,9 --> 0:0:56,42
oldest rivalries in
world football.


23
0:0:56,42 --> 0:0:58,985
The sectarian divide that splits
Rangers and Celtic has


24
0:0:58,985 --> 0:1:1,4
its roots in things that
happened across the Irish Sea


25
0:1:1,4 --> 0:1:2,36
centuries ago.


26
0:1:2,36 --> 0:1:5,255
Today, the hatred is just as
strong and continues to split


27
0:1:5,255 --> 0:1:6,6
the city in two.


28
0:1:6,6 --> 0:1:8,18
MALE SPEAKER 2: I definitely
think people, they see


29
0:1:8,18 --> 0:1:11,535
themselves in the context of the
Old Firm, as either green


30
0:1:11,535 --> 0:1:15,675
or blue, Catholic or Protestant,
British or Irish.


31
0:1:15,675 --> 0:1:17,41
MALE SPEAKER 3: I think at the
end of the day, though,


32
0:1:17,41 --> 0:1:20,48
there's a certain mutual respect
for each other's fans.


33
0:1:20,48 --> 0:1:22,38
KEV KHARAS: So what do you
think of Rangers fans?


34
0:1:22,38 --> 0:1:23,63
MALE SPEAKER 4: Scumbags.


35
0:1:23,63 --> 0:1:30,92



36
0:1:30,92 --> 0:1:35,77
MALE SPEAKER 5: Celtic fans,
I think they're crass,


37
0:1:35,77 --> 0:1:39,77
disrespectful, and
definitely Irish.


38
0:1:39,77 --> 0:1:43,145
MALE SPEAKER 6: I fucking
hate Rangers!


39
0:1:43,145 --> 0:1:46,13
MALE SPEAKER 7: Rangers fans,
they don't know who they are.


40
0:1:46,13 --> 0:1:48,36
They get brought up to hate.


41
0:1:48,36 --> 0:1:49,45
MALE SPEAKER 8: The kind of
lunacy that you get with


42
0:1:49,45 --> 0:1:52,216
Celtics, why you would seek out
the company of of people


43
0:1:52,216 --> 0:1:54,215
who are mentally disturbed
has always been a bit of


44
0:1:54,215 --> 0:1:55,24
a mystery to me.


45
0:1:55,24 --> 0:1:58,17
MALE SPEAKER 9: I bumped into a
Celtic fan with one shoe on.


46
0:1:58,17 --> 0:2:0,445
And I went, you've lost one
shoe, you stupid cunt.


47
0:2:0,445 --> 0:2:1,75
He went, no, no, I found one.


48
0:2:1,75 --> 0:2:3,0
[LAUGHS].


49
0:2:3,0 --> 0:2:4,95



50
0:2:4,95 --> 0:2:5,99
MALE SPEAKER 10: There are
songs I've heard sung at


51
0:2:5,99 --> 0:2:8,59
football matches the last two
seasons that have no place in


52
0:2:8,59 --> 0:2:11,85
Belfast in the 21st century,
never mind Glasgow.


53
0:2:11,85 --> 0:2:12,56
MALE SPEAKER 11:
Follow, follow,


54
0:2:12,56 --> 0:2:13,81
we will follow Rangers.


55
0:2:13,81 --> 0:2:15,88
Anywhere, everywhere,
we will follow on.


56
0:2:15,88 --> 0:2:18,42
Dundee, Hamilton, fuck the
Pope and the Vatican.


57
0:2:18,42 --> 0:2:20,65
If they go to Dublin,
we will follow on.


58
0:2:20,65 --> 0:2:34,34



59
0:2:34,34 --> 0:2:35,88
KEV KHARAS: Living in England
gives you a very black and


60
0:2:35,88 --> 0:2:37,38
white impression of
the Old Firm.


61
0:2:37,38 --> 0:2:40,0
If the cliches about Celtic
fans are true, they're all


62
0:2:40,0 --> 0:2:42,5
Pope-obsessed, IRA
gun-runners.


63
0:2:42,5 --> 0:2:44,79
And if you're a Rangers fan,
you're probably a right-wing


64
0:2:44,79 --> 0:2:48,35
Protestant who only smiles when
you think of the queen.


65
0:2:48,35 --> 0:2:51,9
Of course, these cliches don't
tell the whole story.


66
0:2:51,9 --> 0:2:52,18
This is a complicated hatred.


67
0:2:52,18 --> 0:2:54,46
But one thing both sides seem
to agree on is that they


68
0:2:54,46 --> 0:2:56,79
should be allowed to hate.


69
0:2:56,79 --> 0:2:58,46
The Scottish Parliament
feels differently.


70
0:2:58,46 --> 0:3:0,76
And it's just passed a new
bill aiming to make songs


71
0:3:0,76 --> 0:3:3,7
about Huns and Fenians
a thing of the past.


72
0:3:3,7 --> 0:3:6,26
In Glasgow, there were
murmurings of money problems


73
0:3:6,26 --> 0:3:8,48
at Rangers that threatened to
make the Old Firm itself a


74
0:3:8,48 --> 0:3:10,7
thing of the past.


75
0:3:10,7 --> 0:3:11,74
But on my first visit
to the city, it was


76
0:3:11,74 --> 0:3:13,33
time to get a tour.


77
0:3:13,33 --> 0:3:17,33
I met Joe Miller, founder of
Celtic fanzine "Not The View."


78
0:3:17,33 --> 0:3:18,8
JOE MILLER: This is the
traditional route that Celtic


79
0:3:18,8 --> 0:3:21,49
fans will walk up
to Celtic Park.


80
0:3:21,49 --> 0:3:23,37
This is called the Gallowgate.


81
0:3:23,37 --> 0:3:26,9
It's a very kind of strong
Celtic area.


82
0:3:26,9 --> 0:3:29,29
And this used to be a massive
Irish community here.


83
0:3:29,29 --> 0:3:34,12
Celtic Park, paradise
we call it.


84
0:3:34,12 --> 0:3:35,78
KEV KHARAS: After watching
Celtic fans bond with the


85
0:3:35,78 --> 0:3:38,59
players, we headed over to
Rangers' home, Ibrox, in the


86
0:3:38,59 --> 0:3:40,41
West of the city.


87
0:3:40,41 --> 0:3:43,62
JOE MILLER: This area
here is Bridgetown.


88
0:3:43,62 --> 0:3:45,33
This is where my father's
from, in fact.


89
0:3:45,33 --> 0:3:48,39
And it's a massive
Rangers area.


90
0:3:48,39 --> 0:3:49,78
KEV KHARAS: Do you ever
hang out here?


91
0:3:49,78 --> 0:3:50,89
JOE MILLER: Oh no.


92
0:3:50,89 --> 0:3:51,85
God, no.


93
0:3:51,85 --> 0:3:54,8
Glasgow is--


94
0:3:54,8 --> 0:3:56,33
you walk into a pub, and
anything can happen.


95
0:3:56,33 --> 0:4:0,145
It's just the nature of this
city is very hard.


96
0:4:0,145 --> 0:4:2,423
I got a kicking once
going to Ibrox.


97
0:4:2,423 --> 0:4:5,65
I got a sore one right
between the legs.


98
0:4:5,65 --> 0:4:8,8
This is Paisley Road West.


99
0:4:8,8 --> 0:4:10,41
Just hold your breath
here, guys.


100
0:4:10,41 --> 0:4:11,62
We're coming up to Ibrox.


101
0:4:11,62 --> 0:4:13,17
You'll probably smell it.


102
0:4:13,17 --> 0:4:14,92
KEV KHARAS: Have you got
a name for Ibrox?


103
0:4:14,92 --> 0:4:15,99
JOE MILLER: Oh, yeah.


104
0:4:15,99 --> 0:4:21,576
Castle Greyskull, the
Hunnery, Shit Pit.


105
0:4:21,576 --> 0:4:23,69
KEV KHARAS: At Ibrox, we found
our first proof that the


106
0:4:23,69 --> 0:4:25,835
rivalry extends beyond
Scotland's borders.


107
0:4:25,835 --> 0:4:27,36
It came in the form
of a friendly


108
0:4:27,36 --> 0:4:29,186
German football bigot.


109
0:4:29,186 --> 0:4:31,84
When did you first start
liking Rangers?


110
0:4:31,84 --> 0:4:33,53
GERMAN MAN: First
game was in '86.


111
0:4:33,53 --> 0:4:34,87
KEV KHARAS: OK.


112
0:4:34,87 --> 0:4:35,99
What do you think of Celtic.


113
0:4:35,99 --> 0:4:37,82
GERMAN MAN: [LAUGHS], Fenian.


114
0:4:37,82 --> 0:4:40,55
Fenian bastards.


115
0:4:40,55 --> 0:4:44,165
MALE SPEAKER 12: You shouldn't
say that on camera.


116
0:4:44,165 --> 0:4:46,97
You've just shamed the
whole of Germany.


117
0:4:46,97 --> 0:4:47,546
[LAUGHTER]


118
0:4:47,546 --> 0:4:53,36



119
0:4:53,36 --> 0:4:55,17
KEV KHARAS: The next day, we
went to meet a man named Mark


120
0:4:55,17 --> 0:4:59,19
Dingwall, who runs Rangers
fanzine "Follow Follow."


121
0:4:59,19 --> 0:5:2,59
MARK: Obviously because of the
background, it means more to


122
0:5:2,59 --> 0:5:5,39
more people, I think, than some
of the rivalries that you


123
0:5:5,39 --> 0:5:6,58
would get down south.


124
0:5:6,58 --> 0:5:9,9
But it's not really quite as
serious, I think, as it's


125
0:5:9,9 --> 0:5:12,58
often portrayed in
documentaries, where because


126
0:5:12,58 --> 0:5:15,3
of the religious side of things,
they try to make out


127
0:5:15,3 --> 0:5:17,45
that Glasgow is a sectarian
hotbed.


128
0:5:17,45 --> 0:5:19,98
I think that that's a myth.


129
0:5:19,98 --> 0:5:22,12
KEV KHARAS: Maybe Dingwall's
right, and the idea of Glasgow


130
0:5:22,12 --> 0:5:25,29
as a furnace of sectarian
hatred is a false one.


131
0:5:25,29 --> 0:5:27,74
But pretty much every flag we
saw for sale on match day


132
0:5:27,74 --> 0:5:29,73
referenced the old Troubles
in Ireland.


133
0:5:29,73 --> 0:5:30,75
MARK: Well, it's about
the culture.


134
0:5:30,75 --> 0:5:33,27
I mean, if you look at the links
between Scotland and


135
0:5:33,27 --> 0:5:37,585
Ireland over the last 200, 300
years, we've probably had


136
0:5:37,585 --> 0:5:40,78
about a million people
immigrating to Scotland from


137
0:5:40,78 --> 0:5:42,16
Ireland, and vice versa.


138
0:5:42,16 --> 0:5:44,57
So you do have this culture.


139
0:5:44,57 --> 0:5:47,78
My view would be that a lot of
the media and, well, the


140
0:5:47,78 --> 0:5:50,92
political class, they only want
to concentrate on what


141
0:5:50,92 --> 0:5:52,81
they perceive as violence
and bigotry.


142
0:5:52,81 --> 0:5:54,97
They don't actually want to look
at the positive aspects


143
0:5:54,97 --> 0:5:58,17
of that, or in fact, the
historical reality.


144
0:5:58,17 --> 0:5:58,91
KEV KHARAS: What do
you think of this


145
0:5:58,91 --> 0:6:0,7
phrase, "90 minute bigot"?


146
0:6:0,7 --> 0:6:3,15
MARK: I think it fairly well
sums up what happens at Old


147
0:6:3,15 --> 0:6:3,71
Firm games.


148
0:6:3,71 --> 0:6:8,9
This is the release valve for
mainly working class people at


149
0:6:8,9 --> 0:6:9,5
the end of the week.


150
0:6:9,5 --> 0:6:10,7
Because they go out
to football.


151
0:6:10,7 --> 0:6:12,345
They can say what they want,
do what they want, have a


152
0:6:12,345 --> 0:6:16,192
drink, have a laugh, be loud and
boorish in a way that they


153
0:6:16,192 --> 0:6:17,53
aren't during the rest
of the week.


154
0:6:17,53 --> 0:6:27,95



155
0:6:27,95 --> 0:6:29,78
KEV KHARAS: The next day, I
jumped on the train north to


156
0:6:29,78 --> 0:6:31,72
Dundee to meet Joe Miller
and some of


157
0:6:31,72 --> 0:6:34,136
Celtic's loyal away support.


158
0:6:34,136 --> 0:6:36,51
STEVEN: It wouldn't bother me
tomorrow if they went bust.


159
0:6:36,51 --> 0:6:40,8
And it was a big Tesco,
or whatever.


160
0:6:40,8 --> 0:6:43,6
In fact, I would gladly
shop in it.


161
0:6:43,6 --> 0:6:44,64
MALE SPEAKER 13: It's a kind
of religion to folk.


162
0:6:44,64 --> 0:6:47,44
That's because you turn
out every week.


163
0:6:47,44 --> 0:6:49,72
Glasgow's got a strong
Irish community.


164
0:6:49,72 --> 0:6:52,7
But we couldn't express
ourselves in the community.


165
0:6:52,7 --> 0:6:56,876
There was no St. Patrick's Day
parades or celebrations.


166
0:6:56,876 --> 0:6:59,78
A woman once said to me,
and she goes, are you


167
0:6:59,78 --> 0:7:2,0
one of those Fenians?


168
0:7:2,0 --> 0:7:5,42
And I was actually
taken aback.


169
0:7:5,42 --> 0:7:6,91
She labelled me a Fenian.


170
0:7:6,91 --> 0:7:7,595
KEV KHARAS: Was it a
girl that you were


171
0:7:7,595 --> 0:7:9,11
trying to crack on to?


172
0:7:9,11 --> 0:7:10,27
Or an old woman in the shops?


173
0:7:10,27 --> 0:7:11,545
MALE SPEAKER 13: It was
an older woman.


174
0:7:11,545 --> 0:7:13,38
I was still trying to
crack her as well.


175
0:7:13,38 --> 0:7:21,398



176
0:7:21,398 --> 0:7:25,53
That label right away was,
I'm a Celtic fan.


177
0:7:25,53 --> 0:7:26,86
I'm a Catholic.


178
0:7:26,86 --> 0:7:28,86
I'm an Irish republican.


179
0:7:28,86 --> 0:7:31,1
These are all the labels that
are tied down with that.


180
0:7:31,1 --> 0:7:34,368
And I may not have been any of
them other than a Celtic fan.


181
0:7:34,368 --> 0:7:37,36



182
0:7:37,36 --> 0:7:41,42
With Celtic fans, there is this
cult of victim-hood on


183
0:7:41,42 --> 0:7:42,167
the one hand.


184
0:7:42,167 --> 0:7:45,225
Then on the other hand, they
want to be the tough guys.


185
0:7:45,225 --> 0:7:48,3
They want to support the IRA
and push people around.


186
0:7:48,3 --> 0:7:51,72
I would say that Celtic in the
last 5 to 10 years are


187
0:7:51,72 --> 0:7:56,38
probably more Catholic, more
Irish and more republican.


188
0:7:56,38 --> 0:7:58,727
KEV KHARAS: Do you think that
Rangers fans and Celtic fans


189
0:7:58,727 --> 0:8:0,505
are sort of inherently
different people?


190
0:8:0,505 --> 0:8:2,326
Maybe because of their
upbringing?


191
0:8:2,326 --> 0:8:3,94
MALE SPEAKER 13: We're
more open, I think.


192
0:8:3,94 --> 0:8:6,4
When Rangers fans go abroad,
they go on a rampage.


193
0:8:6,4 --> 0:8:9,51
When we go abroad, we're
probably up singing and


194
0:8:9,51 --> 0:8:12,9
dancing, having more fun
and meeting friends.


195
0:8:12,9 --> 0:8:14,37
KEV KHARAS: Do you have friends
that are Rangers fans?


196
0:8:14,37 --> 0:8:17,4



197
0:8:17,4 --> 0:8:19,17
MALE SPEAKER 13:
Acquaintances.


198
0:8:19,17 --> 0:8:20,26
MARK: I have acquaintances
that would be


199
0:8:20,26 --> 0:8:21,91
nominal Celtic fans.


200
0:8:21,91 --> 0:8:24,98
But general delusions about
persecution, about being a


201
0:8:24,98 --> 0:8:27,88
member of the IRA, about
claiming that your grandfather


202
0:8:27,88 --> 0:8:30,85
fought in the General Post
Office against the British,


203
0:8:30,85 --> 0:8:33,299
that your granny was raped
by the Black and Tans.


204
0:8:33,299 --> 0:8:36,76
I mean, this is not really the
type of people that you want


205
0:8:36,76 --> 0:8:38,95
to associate with.


206
0:8:38,95 --> 0:8:40,4
KEV KHARAS: We saw a sticker
up at Ibrox.


207
0:8:40,4 --> 0:8:42,38
It just had a picture of the
Union Jack that said, love it


208
0:8:42,38 --> 0:8:43,25
or leave it.


209
0:8:43,25 --> 0:8:44,51
MALE SPEAKER 13: Yeah.


210
0:8:44,51 --> 0:8:46,99
Yeah, well, we're
told to go back.


211
0:8:46,99 --> 0:8:49,75
Their famous shout is,
the famine's over.


212
0:8:49,75 --> 0:8:50,77
Why don't you go home?


213
0:8:50,77 --> 0:8:52,11
I've Scottish.


214
0:8:52,11 --> 0:8:53,14
I live here.


215
0:8:53,14 --> 0:8:54,33
I like this country.


216
0:8:54,33 --> 0:8:56,97
KEV KHARAS: Do you think
the bill will help?


217
0:8:56,97 --> 0:8:58,13
MALE SPEAKER 13: The bill
won't help that.


218
0:8:58,13 --> 0:9:2,43
Because it's just attacking
football fans.


219
0:9:2,43 --> 0:9:6,82
There's a culture out there
that has to be changed.


220
0:9:6,82 --> 0:9:8,9
MALE SPEAKER 14: Celtic!


221
0:9:8,9 --> 0:9:11,54
Come on you boys in green!


222
0:9:11,54 --> 0:9:13,658
MALE SPEAKER 15: Come on
you boys in green!


223
0:9:13,658 --> 0:9:16,55
MALE SPEAKER 14: Glasgow's
green and white.


224
0:9:16,55 --> 0:9:18,72
MALE SPEAKER 15: Glasgow's
green and white.


225
0:9:18,72 --> 0:9:20,96
MALE SPEAKER 14: Glasgow's
green and white.


226
0:9:20,96 --> 0:9:23,552
MALE SPEAKER 15: Glasgow's
green and white.


227
0:9:23,552 --> 0:9:24,802
BOTH: [CHANTING]!


228
0:9:24,802 --> 0:9:29,97



229
0:9:29,97 --> 0:9:31,72
MALE SPEAKER 14: Celtic!


230
0:9:31,72 --> 0:9:36,5
MALE SPEAKER 15: Celtic!


231
0:9:36,5 --> 0:9:38,305
KEV KHARAS: Recording crappy
footage on my phone, I made my


232
0:9:38,305 --> 0:9:40,45
way into the ground, where
Celtic's fans were going


233
0:9:40,45 --> 0:9:41,61
through their repertoire.


234
0:9:41,61 --> 0:9:45,0
[CHANTING]


235
0:9:45,0 --> 0:9:47,17
KEV KHARAS: They didn't seem too
worried about falling foul


236
0:9:47,17 --> 0:9:50,255
of the anti-sectarian bill.


237
0:9:50,255 --> 0:9:56,69
[CROWD SHOUTING]


238
0:9:56,69 --> 0:9:57,94
MALE SPEAKER 16: Orange
bastards!


239
0:9:57,94 --> 0:10:1,145



240
0:10:1,145 --> 0:10:17,3
MALE SPEAKER 17: Up the IRA!


241
0:10:17,3 --> 0:10:18,83
KEV KHARAS: I'd made an
appointment to see Nil By


242
0:10:18,83 --> 0:10:20,97
Mouth, a charity based in
Glasgow that wants to


243
0:10:20,97 --> 0:10:23,98
eradicate sectarianism
from Scottish life.


244
0:10:23,98 --> 0:10:26,76
They were set up after a
15-year-old Celtic fan died


245
0:10:26,76 --> 0:10:29,31
after having his throat cut on
the way home from a match.


246
0:10:29,31 --> 0:10:30,24
MALE SPEAKER 18: I came
to university


247
0:10:30,24 --> 0:10:31,86
in Scotland in 1999.


248
0:10:31,86 --> 0:10:35,665
And I went to watch an Old
Firm football game in the


249
0:10:35,665 --> 0:10:36,47
student union's bar.


250
0:10:36,47 --> 0:10:38,25
And I heard this shocking
taunt, which


251
0:10:38,25 --> 0:10:39,79
was, six million Jews.


252
0:10:39,79 --> 0:10:41,276
And it should have
been Protestants.


253
0:10:41,276 --> 0:10:43,245
How many layers of ignorance do
you have to get through to


254
0:10:43,245 --> 0:10:45,89
come out with that
type of stuff?


255
0:10:45,89 --> 0:10:47,95
People have often put to me the
idea that in Scotland we


256
0:10:47,95 --> 0:10:49,41
have 90-minute bigots.


257
0:10:49,41 --> 0:10:51,9
Now, you know that
kind of idea.


258
0:10:51,9 --> 0:10:53,23
For 90 minutes, we go,
we watch football.


259
0:10:53,23 --> 0:10:54,43
We taunt the other sides.


260
0:10:54,43 --> 0:10:55,3
We use these kind of words.


261
0:10:55,3 --> 0:10:56,9
And then we go back to
our kind of life.


262
0:10:56,9 --> 0:10:58,58
Now I'll put it to you in
this kind of context.


263
0:10:58,58 --> 0:11:0,79
If I use the term nigger
to you, you'd


264
0:11:0,79 --> 0:11:1,87
find that quite offensive.


265
0:11:1,87 --> 0:11:4,25
And quite rightly, because
it's a disgusting term.


266
0:11:4,25 --> 0:11:6,72
Does that make you a
90-minute racist?


267
0:11:6,72 --> 0:11:8,3
Does it really?


268
0:11:8,3 --> 0:11:9,3
You know, we all have
to have laws.


269
0:11:9,3 --> 0:11:11,61
And we have to have boundaries
as what is acceptable behavior


270
0:11:11,61 --> 0:11:12,21
and what is not.


271
0:11:12,21 --> 0:11:13,836
And if you don't have that,
then it's a bit


272
0:11:13,836 --> 0:11:14,49
of a free for all.


273
0:11:14,49 --> 0:11:17,71
And people do what they want,
as and when they want.


274
0:11:17,71 --> 0:11:20,7
KEV KHARAS: This is Abdul Rafiq,
a Muslim Rangers fan


275
0:11:20,7 --> 0:11:22,29
who's banned from football
matches for five years for


276
0:11:22,29 --> 0:11:23,63
singing anti-Catholic songs.


277
0:11:23,63 --> 0:11:27,418
So how has this ban order
affected your ritual?


278
0:11:27,418 --> 0:11:29,679
Because I imagine it must have
been a pretty big part of your


279
0:11:29,679 --> 0:11:30,28
life before.


280
0:11:30,28 --> 0:11:31,98
ABDUL: Yeah, I used to go to
all the Rangers matches.


281
0:11:31,98 --> 0:11:35,16
But now, to suddenly not be
allowed to go to matches, it's


282
0:11:35,16 --> 0:11:37,52
had a big effect on
me, you know?


283
0:11:37,52 --> 0:11:41,3
And I just don't think the
punishment fits the crime,


284
0:11:41,3 --> 0:11:43,3
just for singing songs,
you know?


285
0:11:43,3 --> 0:11:45,16
I was singing the "Follow,
Follow" songs.


286
0:11:45,16 --> 0:11:47,12
But there were some added-on
words that you're


287
0:11:47,12 --> 0:11:49,123
not supposed to sing.


288
0:11:49,123 --> 0:11:51,13
KEV KHARAS: What
were they like?


289
0:11:51,13 --> 0:11:53,9
ABDUL: Dundee, Hamilton, eff
the Pope and the Vatican.


290
0:11:53,9 --> 0:11:56,6
You know, that one.


291
0:11:56,6 --> 0:11:57,23
KEV KHARAS: The banning
order has made Abdul a


292
0:11:57,23 --> 0:11:58,67
pretty famous guy.


293
0:11:58,67 --> 0:12:0,2
He's well-known both
on the streets of


294
0:12:0,2 --> 0:12:2,266
Glasgow and on the internet.


295
0:12:2,266 --> 0:12:5,881
ABDUL: Oh, I do like to
be beside the seaside.


296
0:12:5,881 --> 0:12:9,22
And I do like to be
beside the sea.


297
0:12:9,22 --> 0:12:13,262
With a hammer in my hand, Fenian
bashing on the sand


298
0:12:13,262 --> 0:12:16,6
beside the seaside,
beside the sea.


299
0:12:16,6 --> 0:12:17,69
I've got friends that
are Celtic fans.


300
0:12:17,69 --> 0:12:18,93
So it's only a game.


301
0:12:18,93 --> 0:12:19,6
It's only a bit of banter.


302
0:12:19,6 --> 0:12:22,94
And I've got to sign in at a
police station in the first


303
0:12:22,94 --> 0:12:26,19
half of every Rangers game
for the next five years.


304
0:12:26,19 --> 0:12:27,95
I'm on my way just now.


305
0:12:27,95 --> 0:12:29,77
KEV KHARAS: Abdul's also famous
for being the only


306
0:12:29,77 --> 0:12:32,16
Muslim member of right-wing
nationalist group the English


307
0:12:32,16 --> 0:12:33,29
Defense League.


308
0:12:33,29 --> 0:12:36,52
ABDUL: If you're born in
Britain, then it's natural to


309
0:12:36,52 --> 0:12:37,59
like your country.


310
0:12:37,59 --> 0:12:39,47
The flag of my country is
red, white, and blue.


311
0:12:39,47 --> 0:12:40,96
Rangers play in those colors.


312
0:12:40,96 --> 0:12:42,245
I don't go to the mosque
to pray five


313
0:12:42,245 --> 0:12:43,24
times a day or anything.


314
0:12:43,24 --> 0:12:47,165
But I'd still like to
be a good person.


315
0:12:47,165 --> 0:12:48,17
That's being religious
as well.


316
0:12:48,17 --> 0:12:48,94
I'm a good person.


317
0:12:48,94 --> 0:12:50,8
I'm good to accept everybody.


318
0:12:50,8 --> 0:12:50,94
So that's being religious.


319
0:12:50,94 --> 0:12:53,99
So I would say I'm religious
in a way.


320
0:12:53,99 --> 0:12:55,85
KEV KHARAS: Do you think you get
picked on because Rangers


321
0:12:55,85 --> 0:12:59,74
is, you know, traditionally
a very Protestant club.


322
0:12:59,74 --> 0:13:3,27
ABDUL: Because of my connection
to the EDL and SDL,


323
0:13:3,27 --> 0:13:4,64
the police recognize me.


324
0:13:4,64 --> 0:13:7,31
So I do get picked
on by the police.


325
0:13:7,31 --> 0:13:9,73
That day I got arrested at the
football match, the officers


326
0:13:9,73 --> 0:13:10,36
recognized me.


327
0:13:10,36 --> 0:13:12,225
And it was a high-profile
match because we


328
0:13:12,225 --> 0:13:13,355
were playing Chelsea.


329
0:13:13,355 --> 0:13:16,142
And the Chelsea fans were
there chanting my name.


330
0:13:16,142 --> 0:13:16,926
KEV KHARAS: Really?


331
0:13:16,926 --> 0:13:18,2
What were they singing?


332
0:13:18,2 --> 0:13:21,63
ABDUL: They were just chanting
the name, Abdul, Abdul, EDL.


333
0:13:21,63 --> 0:13:23,81
I have a few racist remarks
from Rangers fans.


334
0:13:23,81 --> 0:13:24,57
Just a few.


335
0:13:24,57 --> 0:13:25,95
But you're always going to
expect a few anyway.


336
0:13:25,95 --> 0:13:31,7



337
0:13:31,7 --> 0:13:33,68
KEV KHARAS: As Abdul lapped up
the attention outside Ibrox,


338
0:13:33,68 --> 0:13:36,25
keeping the rain off his head
with his Union Jack umbrella,


339
0:13:36,25 --> 0:13:39,22
I couldn't come to think of
him as a spiteful guy.


340
0:13:39,22 --> 0:13:41,68
It just seemed like he wanted to
be part of something, even


341
0:13:41,68 --> 0:13:43,93
if that something had turned him
into a football bigot who


342
0:13:43,93 --> 0:13:44,59
hangs out with fascists.


343
0:13:44,59 --> 0:13:48,7
What is it that you identify
with with the EDL?


344
0:13:48,7 --> 0:13:50,45
ABDUL: Well, the EDL are
against extremism.


345
0:13:50,45 --> 0:13:51,86
They're against all sorts
of extremism.


346
0:13:51,86 --> 0:13:53,7
They're not against
just Muslims.


347
0:13:53,7 --> 0:13:55,54
They're against all, even the
Catholics, IRA, and that.


348
0:13:55,54 --> 0:13:56,58
And I'm born and bred
in Britain,


349
0:13:56,58 --> 0:13:57,55
and I love my country.


350
0:13:57,55 --> 0:14:0,71
So I'm against any sort of
extremism, you know.


351
0:14:0,71 --> 0:14:1,74
And they're open to anybody.


352
0:14:1,74 --> 0:14:3,15
They're not racist and that.


353
0:14:3,15 --> 0:14:5,1
KEV KHARAS: Do you not buy the
argument that they are


354
0:14:5,1 --> 0:14:8,41
themselves racist
people, the EDL?


355
0:14:8,41 --> 0:14:9,75
ABDUL: But if they were
racist, they wouldn't


356
0:14:9,75 --> 0:14:10,48
have me with them.


357
0:14:10,48 --> 0:14:12,82
KEV KHARAS: Do you think they
might be saying one thing and


358
0:14:12,82 --> 0:14:15,1
doing another, trying to
hide, maybe, the fact


359
0:14:15,1 --> 0:14:16,68
that they are racist?


360
0:14:16,68 --> 0:14:18,66
ABDUL: Well, they're asking
me to bring more


361
0:14:18,66 --> 0:14:19,88
Muslims to join up.


362
0:14:19,88 --> 0:14:21,71
When they're down your
street, they don't


363
0:14:21,71 --> 0:14:22,72
shout abuse at Muslims.


364
0:14:22,72 --> 0:14:24,56
They actually say to them,
come and join us.


365
0:14:24,56 --> 0:14:26,14
MALE SPEAKER 19: You little
poof, where are you going?


366
0:14:26,14 --> 0:14:28,42
Are you banned from still
going to Ibrox?


367
0:14:28,42 --> 0:14:29,34
ABDUL: Aye.


368
0:14:29,34 --> 0:14:32,83
I'm back with EDL, though.


369
0:14:32,83 --> 0:14:34,8
He was from the EDL.


370
0:14:34,8 --> 0:14:37,546



371
0:14:37,546 --> 0:14:39,36
MALE SPEAKER 19: Don't
let them video you.


372
0:14:39,36 --> 0:14:40,51
ABDUL: No, it's all right.


373
0:14:40,51 --> 0:14:42,27
They're not going against it.


374
0:14:42,27 --> 0:14:43,84
MALE SPEAKER 19: They'll fucking
put it against you.


375
0:14:43,84 --> 0:14:45,9
ABDUL: No, it's all right.


376
0:14:45,9 --> 0:14:48,766



377
0:14:48,766 --> 0:14:50,31
KEV KHARAS: Abdul's mates
didn't seem to like our


378
0:14:50,31 --> 0:14:51,45
cameras all that much.


379
0:14:51,45 --> 0:14:55,76
So to avoid a beating,
we went elsewhere.


380
0:14:55,76 --> 0:14:57,25
How does it make you
feel when you see?


381
0:14:57,25 --> 0:15:1,23
ABDUL: Well, when you see that,
it makes me look out to


382
0:15:1,23 --> 0:15:3,34
be as if I'm a Catholic-hater
or something.


383
0:15:3,34 --> 0:15:4,6
But that's not the
case, you know.


384
0:15:4,6 --> 0:15:5,85
Because I just think
that it's banter.


385
0:15:5,85 --> 0:15:20,8



386
0:15:20,8 --> 0:15:22,587
Another notorious Ranger
celebrity who is against the


387
0:15:22,587 --> 0:15:24,78
bill is Sandy Chugg.


388
0:15:24,78 --> 0:15:26,86
Sandy was one of the stars of
the Scottish football violence


389
0:15:26,86 --> 0:15:29,19
scene of the '80s and '90s.


390
0:15:29,19 --> 0:15:31,87
He led Rangers' terrifying Inter
City Firm into battle


391
0:15:31,87 --> 0:15:32,87
many times.


392
0:15:32,87 --> 0:15:36,51
SANDY: As much as I dislike
Celtic songs, the IRA songs


393
0:15:36,51 --> 0:15:39,13
and that, I will defend our
rights to sing them.


394
0:15:39,13 --> 0:15:40,1
The product's not great.


395
0:15:40,1 --> 0:15:41,945
The crowds are dwindling.


396
0:15:41,945 --> 0:15:45,927
And they want to lock up people
for to provide a wee


397
0:15:45,927 --> 0:15:48,218
bit of atmosphere
at the football.


398
0:15:48,218 --> 0:15:50,66
[INAUDIBLE], well done.


399
0:15:50,66 --> 0:15:51,5
Good, good.


400
0:15:51,5 --> 0:15:51,89
Keep it going.


401
0:15:51,89 --> 0:15:53,2
KEV KHARAS: As far
as we know, Sandy


402
0:15:53,2 --> 0:15:54,9
isn't a hooligan anymore.


403
0:15:54,9 --> 0:15:57,59
Instead, he spends his time
here, training kids at this


404
0:15:57,59 --> 0:15:59,25
school in Glasgow's East End.


405
0:15:59,25 --> 0:16:0,433
SANDY: Come on, [INAUDIBLE].


406
0:16:0,433 --> 0:16:0,796
Wrap your feet around it.


407
0:16:0,796 --> 0:16:2,7
Come on.


408
0:16:2,7 --> 0:16:3,93
I started playing about
8 years old.


409
0:16:3,93 --> 0:16:7,17
Then I was picked up with the
Rangers, under-14 level.


410
0:16:7,17 --> 0:16:9,36
I spent two years there.


411
0:16:9,36 --> 0:16:12,85
Unfortunately, I wasn't good
enough to make the grade.


412
0:16:12,85 --> 0:16:14,52
Other things in my life
at the time as


413
0:16:14,52 --> 0:16:16,89
well, the Casual scene.


414
0:16:16,89 --> 0:16:20,26
I was finding out I was a lot
better football Casual than I


415
0:16:20,26 --> 0:16:22,7
was a football player.


416
0:16:22,7 --> 0:16:24,745
So I sort of got sidetracked.


417
0:16:24,745 --> 0:16:26,31
KEV KHARAS: Do you regret
that at all?


418
0:16:26,31 --> 0:16:27,26
SANDY: No.


419
0:16:27,26 --> 0:16:29,7
To be honest, I loved
the scene.


420
0:16:29,7 --> 0:16:32,84
It the biggest youth culture
explosion, in my opinion,


421
0:16:32,84 --> 0:16:34,52
since the Mods.


422
0:16:34,52 --> 0:16:39,585
Boys from Yeovil to Inverness
were involved in fighting each


423
0:16:39,585 --> 0:16:40,56
other, fighting the law.


424
0:16:40,56 --> 0:16:43,31
To be part of that, looking
back, although I know I


425
0:16:43,31 --> 0:16:48,9
wouldn't say it makes me proud,
I am sort of glad that


426
0:16:48,9 --> 0:16:49,24
I was involved in it.


427
0:16:49,24 --> 0:16:51,81
I was lost to the rave
generation for about two or


428
0:16:51,81 --> 0:16:52,39
three years.


429
0:16:52,39 --> 0:16:54,94
That was the next new wave
of youth culture.


430
0:16:54,94 --> 0:16:59,62
It led me to three years
in prison for


431
0:16:59,62 --> 0:17:1,96
dealing LSD and ecstasy.


432
0:17:1,96 --> 0:17:3,58
That's my major regret
in life.


433
0:17:3,58 --> 0:17:5,53
And my one ambition was
to be a Royal Marine.


434
0:17:5,53 --> 0:17:8,765
Blew that out of the water.


435
0:17:8,765 --> 0:17:13,593
I want to prove to the parents
that despite my past, I'm the


436
0:17:13,593 --> 0:17:15,65
best person to coach
their kids.


437
0:17:15,65 --> 0:17:17,41
KEV KHARAS: Even though a
minority have complained about


438
0:17:17,41 --> 0:17:20,24
Sandy's past to the school, he
didn't seem too worried about


439
0:17:20,24 --> 0:17:22,63
re-living it in front of the
parents and their kids.


440
0:17:22,63 --> 0:17:27,31
When you see your picture next
to words like scum, and thugs,


441
0:17:27,31 --> 0:17:30,2
and wrecking the good name of
the Tartan army, I mean, how


442
0:17:30,2 --> 0:17:31,52
did that make you feel?


443
0:17:31,52 --> 0:17:35,605
SANDY: In a strange way, I
was slightly proud to be


444
0:17:35,605 --> 0:17:36,55
recognized.


445
0:17:36,55 --> 0:17:39,165
But when I look back, and I'm
looking back over a lot of


446
0:17:39,165 --> 0:17:42,365
stuff here, I'm kind of
thinking, that wasn't really


447
0:17:42,365 --> 0:17:46,51
one of your cleverest moments
in your life,


448
0:17:46,51 --> 0:17:47,245
you know what I mean?


449
0:17:47,245 --> 0:17:47,83
KEV KHARAS: Yeah.


450
0:17:47,83 --> 0:17:49,23
SANDY: It's something
to look back on.


451
0:17:49,23 --> 0:17:53,485
Maybe some people have
photo albums.


452
0:17:53,485 --> 0:17:55,31
KEV KHARAS: I mean, was football
violence an addiction


453
0:17:55,31 --> 0:17:56,26
for you, do you think?


454
0:17:56,26 --> 0:17:57,702
SANDY: Oh, most certainly.


455
0:17:57,702 --> 0:17:58,83
Without a doubt.


456
0:17:58,83 --> 0:18:3,28
No matter how hard I tried to
walk away, I always seemed to


457
0:18:3,28 --> 0:18:4,53
get dragged back in.


458
0:18:4,53 --> 0:18:12,87



459
0:18:12,87 --> 0:18:14,455
A lot of people liked
the camaraderie.


460
0:18:14,455 --> 0:18:15,56
I liked the violence.


461
0:18:15,56 --> 0:18:16,26
I'll be honest.


462
0:18:16,26 --> 0:18:17,73
I'm not going to beat about the


463
0:18:17,73 --> 0:18:20,404
bush, I liked the violence.


464
0:18:20,404 --> 0:18:22,88
KEV KHARAS: So what for you is
the biggest misconception that


465
0:18:22,88 --> 0:18:26,434
people have about the Glasgow
football rivalry?


466
0:18:26,434 --> 0:18:31,75
SANDY: I think the biggest
misconception is primarily a


467
0:18:31,75 --> 0:18:33,54
religious aspect.


468
0:18:33,54 --> 0:18:36,96
In my own personal opinion, I
believe it's now turning into


469
0:18:36,96 --> 0:18:38,495
a national identity.


470
0:18:38,495 --> 0:18:41,695
It's Scottish-British,
or you're Irish.


471
0:18:41,695 --> 0:18:54,458



472
0:18:54,458 --> 0:18:57,62
KEV KHARAS: That guy going mad
with a bin is Sandy's old


473
0:18:57,62 --> 0:18:59,2
sparring partner, John O'Kane.


474
0:18:59,2 --> 0:19:1,98
John was one of the founding
fathers of the


475
0:19:1,98 --> 0:19:2,28
Celtic Soccer Crew Firm.


476
0:19:2,28 --> 0:19:3,81
His life with the Casuals
saw him up before


477
0:19:3,81 --> 0:19:5,51
the judge 66 times.


478
0:19:5,51 --> 0:19:8,592
I'd arranged to meet him
in a pub across town.


479
0:19:8,592 --> 0:19:11,78
Was there, when you were
fighting, that kind of


480
0:19:11,78 --> 0:19:12,99
unwritten, unspoken code?


481
0:19:12,99 --> 0:19:14,8
JOHN: After a Scotland game,
we got into a fight with


482
0:19:14,8 --> 0:19:15,4
Patrick Thistle.


483
0:19:15,4 --> 0:19:17,89
And there were a few of them
on the ground after it.


484
0:19:17,89 --> 0:19:19,45
And the rest of them
had run away.


485
0:19:19,45 --> 0:19:21,62
And we'd gotten them up and made
sure the guys were OK,


486
0:19:21,62 --> 0:19:23,37
and things like that.


487
0:19:23,37 --> 0:19:24,12
You all right, mate?


488
0:19:24,12 --> 0:19:25,835
All your mates have fucked
off and left you.


489
0:19:25,835 --> 0:19:28,53
I'm just making sure
you're OK.


490
0:19:28,53 --> 0:19:30,82
It's an unwritten
sort of rule.


491
0:19:30,82 --> 0:19:31,58
A fight's a fight.


492
0:19:31,58 --> 0:19:33,42
KEV KHARAS: Does that
mutual respect


493
0:19:33,42 --> 0:19:34,95
extend to Rangers fans?


494
0:19:34,95 --> 0:19:36,6
JOHN: No.


495
0:19:36,6 --> 0:19:36,97
Certainly not.


496
0:19:36,97 --> 0:19:40,41
Because I've been stabbed, had
my ear cut off by the Rangers,


497
0:19:40,41 --> 0:19:42,4
and been slashed
so many times.


498
0:19:42,4 --> 0:19:46,39
They actually threw one of our
boys off a bridge near Ibrox


499
0:19:46,39 --> 0:19:49,48
stadium onto the M8 motorway.


500
0:19:49,48 --> 0:19:51,32
KEV KHARAS: The big guys with
him were from Shebeen,


501
0:19:51,32 --> 0:19:55,2
Glasgow's premier republican
band and lifelong Celtic fans.


502
0:19:55,2 --> 0:19:55,59
GRAEME: [SINGING]


503
0:19:55,59 --> 0:19:59,32
I have four green fields.


504
0:19:59,32 --> 0:20:2,6



505
0:20:2,6 --> 0:20:8,13
Each one was a jewel.


506
0:20:8,13 --> 0:20:11,22
Nil By Mouth is the worst.


507
0:20:11,22 --> 0:20:13,91
They don't live in
the real world.


508
0:20:13,91 --> 0:20:15,4
Celtics are singing "The Fields
of Athenry," then


509
0:20:15,4 --> 0:20:16,37
they're singing "The


510
0:20:16,37 --> 0:20:18,73
Famine Song." Who cares?


511
0:20:18,73 --> 0:20:20,9
Who really cares about it?


512
0:20:20,9 --> 0:20:21,331
It's a bit of banter.


513
0:20:21,331 --> 0:20:21,802
[SINGING]


514
0:20:21,802 --> 0:20:27,9
And my four green fields.


515
0:20:27,9 --> 0:20:31,71
Run red with their
blood, said she.


516
0:20:31,71 --> 0:20:34,6



517
0:20:34,6 --> 0:20:36,26
KEV KHARAS: So do you feel like
Shebeen might be under


518
0:20:36,26 --> 0:20:36,68
threat from the bill?


519
0:20:36,68 --> 0:20:39,68
GRAEME: Well, if they come in
and arrest me or Alan for


520
0:20:39,68 --> 0:20:44,59
singing songs of Ireland,
then I'm a political


521
0:20:44,59 --> 0:20:46,1
prisoner, in my view.


522
0:20:46,1 --> 0:20:47,3
Sectarianism is divisive.


523
0:20:47,3 --> 0:20:50,3
Republicanism is about unity.


524
0:20:50,3 --> 0:20:50,575
[SINGING]


525
0:20:50,575 --> 0:21:3,53
And my four green fields will
bloom once again, said she.


526
0:21:3,53 --> 0:21:10,502
[APPLAUSE]


527
0:21:10,502 --> 0:21:11,752
GRAEME: That's a wrap.


528
0:21:11,752 --> 0:21:29,45



529
0:21:29,45 --> 0:21:31,79
KEV KHARAS: We had already
met Celtic men in pubs.


530
0:21:31,79 --> 0:21:34,28
Now it was time to meet
Rangers men in pubs.


531
0:21:34,28 --> 0:21:36,1
And they were all men.


532
0:21:36,1 --> 0:21:38,18
I've never seen so many tough
looking guys as those that


533
0:21:38,18 --> 0:21:40,85
poured out of Ibrox subway
station on match day.


534
0:21:40,85 --> 0:21:42,89
Most of them called in
at the Louden bar en


535
0:21:42,89 --> 0:21:43,86
route to the ground.


536
0:21:43,86 --> 0:21:46,18
There's a guy over there just
being let away by police.


537
0:21:46,18 --> 0:21:48,84
And I think he's one of the two
guys that came up to us


538
0:21:48,84 --> 0:21:51,7
just now outside the Louden bar
and started harassing us.


539
0:21:51,7 --> 0:21:53,25
They didn't like the camera
or my accent very much.


540
0:21:53,25 --> 0:21:54,25
They called me an English
wanker, which is


541
0:21:54,25 --> 0:21:55,58
difficult to deny.


542
0:21:55,58 --> 0:21:58,65
Then his mate came over and
started shoving me and


543
0:21:58,65 --> 0:22:0,81
grabbing the camera stuff
and kicked me.


544
0:22:0,81 --> 0:22:2,94
So I guess he's been having
a bit more fun inside the


545
0:22:2,94 --> 0:22:4,138
stadium as well.

MALE SPEAKERS:

547
0:22:4,626 --> 0:22:8,774
As I walked round and round,
the penny arcade, just ring


548
0:22:8,774 --> 0:22:11,946
the bell on the big bagatelle.


549
0:22:11,946 --> 0:22:15,85
And you'll make all those
colored lights cascade.


550
0:22:15,85 --> 0:22:18,778
ROBERT: I think 99%
of the Rangers and


551
0:22:18,778 --> 0:22:20,335
Celtic are well behaved.


552
0:22:20,335 --> 0:22:22,6
I think they get a bad press
because it suits the


553
0:22:22,6 --> 0:22:23,934
politicians.

0:22:28,407 --> 0:22:31,886
Roll up and spend
your last dime.


557
0:22:31,886 --> 0:22:34,868
ROBERT: I have no animosity
towards anyone, including


558
0:22:34,868 --> 0:22:35,862
Celtic fans.


559
0:22:35,862 --> 0:22:37,353
I'm not a lover of their club.


560
0:22:37,353 --> 0:22:39,341
I think their club is corrupt
and always has been since the


561
0:22:39,341 --> 0:22:40,335
day it was formed.


562
0:22:40,335 --> 0:22:41,826
I mean, that's only
my opinion.


563
0:22:41,826 --> 0:22:42,82
And I'm allowed it.


564
0:22:42,82 --> 0:22:43,814
I'm Scottish.


565
0:22:43,814 --> 0:22:45,83
And I'm proud to be Scottish.


566
0:22:45,83 --> 0:22:49,33
I'm not born in Glasgow and some
sort of pseudo Irishman.


567
0:22:49,33 --> 0:22:51,33
I don't know where they
get that from.

round and round the

571
0:22:58,83 --> 0:23:2,33
Just ring the bell on

KEV KHARAS: The Rangers fans
we'd met have been


575
0:23:11,1 --> 0:23:11,52
disappointed.


576
0:23:11,52 --> 0:23:13,99
But so far we'd only been shown
around the city by a


577
0:23:13,99 --> 0:23:15,18
Celtic fan.


578
0:23:15,18 --> 0:23:18,892
So they told us to seek out

0:23:21,12 --> 0:23:22,81
DARKHORSE: She says, you
need to stop, driver.


581
0:23:22,81 --> 0:23:23,813
I said, what for?


582
0:23:23,813 --> 0:23:24,74
She said, I need a toilet.


583
0:23:24,74 --> 0:23:25,86
I said, I can't stop
on the motorway.


584
0:23:25,86 --> 0:23:27,486
But there's a garage a
couple of miles up.


585
0:23:27,486 --> 0:23:32,606
And she says, no, if you don't
stop, I'll piss your seat.


586
0:23:32,606 --> 0:23:34,26
I told her I'd punch
her cunt in.


587
0:23:34,26 --> 0:23:35,786
That's what I said to her.


588
0:23:35,786 --> 0:23:37,89
So she didn't piss the seat.


589
0:23:37,89 --> 0:23:40,39
I've taken a lot of people right
to the hospital after a


590
0:23:40,39 --> 0:23:43,86
Rangers/Celtic game,
after the derbies.


591
0:23:43,86 --> 0:23:45,9
It's a pretty bad
sight, you know.


592
0:23:45,9 --> 0:23:49,65
Mostly slashes, bottles,
knives mostly.


593
0:23:49,65 --> 0:23:52,38
The last Rangers game,
I picked up two


594
0:23:52,38 --> 0:23:53,11
fellows in a town.


595
0:23:53,11 --> 0:23:56,24
And they were telling me, they
were up with their kids.


596
0:23:56,24 --> 0:23:59,5
And two Celtic fans attacked
the father in


597
0:23:59,5 --> 0:24:0,866
front of the kid.


598
0:24:0,866 --> 0:24:3,1
That was the last Rangers/Celtic
game.


599
0:24:3,1 --> 0:24:4,34
So there you go.


600
0:24:4,34 --> 0:24:5,59
All because they're English.


601
0:24:5,59 --> 0:24:12,21



602
0:24:12,21 --> 0:24:12,444
MALE SPEAKERS: [CHANTING]


603
0:24:12,444 --> 0:24:16,5
Hail hail, the Celts are here.


604
0:24:16,5 --> 0:24:17,82
KEV KHARAS: On derby day,
Glasgow was buzzing.


605
0:24:17,82 --> 0:24:20,71
U pubs were rammed with
both sets of supports.


606
0:24:20,71 --> 0:24:22,77
These fans had traveled all the
way from the Falls Road in


607
0:24:22,77 --> 0:24:25,407
Belfast to watch the crunch
match at Celtic Park.


608
0:24:25,407 --> 0:24:26,84
MALE SPEAKER 20: Come
on the Celts!


609
0:24:26,84 --> 0:24:28,45
KEV KHARAS: Ond man who wouldn't
be attending the


610
0:24:28,45 --> 0:24:31,79
match, however, was Abdul Rafiq,
whose anti-Pope banter


611
0:24:31,79 --> 0:24:32,71
earned him a banning order.


612
0:24:32,71 --> 0:24:34,98
Can you remember your first
derby day memories?


613
0:24:34,98 --> 0:24:36,84
ABDUL: That's going back
about 30 years.


614
0:24:36,84 --> 0:24:38,44
At that time, you were able
to sing what you wanted.


615
0:24:38,44 --> 0:24:40,56
There used to be much more
trouble at that time.


616
0:24:40,56 --> 0:24:40,9
And there was more singing.


617
0:24:40,9 --> 0:24:42,81
KEV KHARAS: Do you prefer that
kind of more resentful


618
0:24:42,81 --> 0:24:43,68
atmosphere?


619
0:24:43,68 --> 0:24:44,27
ABDUL: Yeah, definitely.


620
0:24:44,27 --> 0:24:45,66
Because the atmosphere
is what makes it.


621
0:24:45,66 --> 0:24:47,36
It's biggest club match
in the world.


622
0:24:47,36 --> 0:24:49,75
And what makes it special
is the atmosphere.


623
0:24:49,75 --> 0:24:50,19
But it's just a game.


624
0:24:50,19 --> 0:24:52,29
And to me, it's just
a bit of banter.


625
0:24:52,29 --> 0:24:55,69
Stick your right hand out, and
you punch a Taig about.


626
0:24:55,69 --> 0:24:58,8
You kneecap the bastard
when you get him down.


627
0:24:58,8 --> 0:25:0,99
That's what it's all about.


628
0:25:0,99 --> 0:25:3,25
KEV KHARAS: I've found some
examples of anti-Celtic,


629
0:25:3,25 --> 0:25:4,59
anti-Catholic stuff.


630
0:25:4,59 --> 0:25:5,442
Is that OK if I show you?


631
0:25:5,442 --> 0:25:7,47
You can tell me whether they're
banter or not, or


632
0:25:7,47 --> 0:25:9,52
whether they cross the line.


633
0:25:9,52 --> 0:25:12,27
"Jungle Bhoys Against Reporting
Pedophiles." So


634
0:25:12,27 --> 0:25:17,38
that's alleging that Celtic fans
are sort of part of some


635
0:25:17,38 --> 0:25:19,64
big Catholic pedophile ring.


636
0:25:19,64 --> 0:25:20,46
Is that too far?


637
0:25:20,46 --> 0:25:21,5
Or is that banter?


638
0:25:21,5 --> 0:25:23,19
ABDUL: I'll just put that
down as banter.


639
0:25:23,19 --> 0:25:25,39
KEV KHARAS: Yeah, Just banter.


640
0:25:25,39 --> 0:25:29,18
Another, "Sweeping Child Abuse
Under the Carpet Since 1972."


641
0:25:29,18 --> 0:25:31,48
ABDUL: I'd Just put
that as banter.


642
0:25:31,48 --> 0:25:32,16
KEV KHARAS: How about that?


643
0:25:32,16 --> 0:25:35,43
A Celtic fan making a monkey
sign at El Hadji Diouf.


644
0:25:35,43 --> 0:25:40,93



645
0:25:40,93 --> 0:25:45,69
ABDUL: Well, some people
will take that serious.


646
0:25:45,69 --> 0:25:47,76
But other people will
just look at that


647
0:25:47,76 --> 0:25:49,4
as banter, you know.


648
0:25:49,4 --> 0:25:49,82
KEV KHARAS: So that's 50/50.


649
0:25:49,82 --> 0:25:50,72
That's on the line.


650
0:25:50,72 --> 0:25:53,5
ABDUL: 50/50.


651
0:25:53,5 --> 0:25:55,53
KEV KHARAS: So there's a fan
attacking Neil Lennon.


652
0:25:55,53 --> 0:25:57,11
ABDUL: Well, that's obviously
gone too far.


653
0:25:57,11 --> 0:25:59,795
Because he should never have
come on the pitch to attack.


654
0:25:59,795 --> 0:26:1,95
I know a lot of Rangers fans
don't like Neil Lennon.


655
0:26:1,95 --> 0:26:4,12
But I've met Neil
Lennon myself.


656
0:26:4,12 --> 0:26:5,61
And he says he doesn't mind
all the abuse he gets.


657
0:26:5,61 --> 0:26:7,89
But he doesn't like it when
somebody comes and attacks him


658
0:26:7,89 --> 0:26:9,36
on the street, or whatever.


659
0:26:9,36 --> 0:26:11,88
KEV KHARAS: "Celtic will get
fucked up the ass like what


660
0:26:11,88 --> 0:26:14,4
those Catholic priests
did to little kids.


661
0:26:14,4 --> 0:26:17,24
#pedophiles."


662
0:26:17,24 --> 0:26:18,125
ABDUL: Just banter.


663
0:26:18,125 --> 0:26:18,8
Just saying that.


664
0:26:18,8 --> 0:26:20,37
KEV KHARAS: Yeah, but
it's child abuse.


665
0:26:20,37 --> 0:26:22,45
So I don't know, is that?


666
0:26:22,45 --> 0:26:22,835
All right.


667
0:26:22,835 --> 0:26:24,82
Well, that's the end of
the bant-o-meter.


668
0:26:24,82 --> 0:26:27,14
ABDUL: The only bit I see as
over the line there was when


669
0:26:27,14 --> 0:26:28,8
Neil Lennon was getting
attacked.


670
0:26:28,8 --> 0:26:29,56
When they're actually violent,
when they're


671
0:26:29,56 --> 0:26:30,19
fighting each other.


672
0:26:30,19 --> 0:26:30,785
That's when it's
over the line.


673
0:26:30,785 --> 0:26:33,35
But when it's just singing and
taunting one another, I don't


674
0:26:33,35 --> 0:26:35,6
see why the police should
bother moving.


675
0:26:35,6 --> 0:26:38,32
Just let them have their fun.


676
0:26:38,32 --> 0:26:39,75
KEV KHARAS: Looking for some
of that fun that Abdul


677
0:26:39,75 --> 0:26:42,7
mentioned, we headed down the
Gallowgate to the Barras.


678
0:26:42,7 --> 0:26:44,51
the Celtic stronghold in
the East of Glasgow.


679
0:26:44,51 --> 0:26:46,69
There we ran into ardent
Celtic fan, Jonny.


680
0:26:46,69 --> 0:26:49,22
We talked to him about derby
day in the city.


681
0:26:49,22 --> 0:26:51,36
So we're in the Barras on
the day of the match.


682
0:26:51,36 --> 0:26:53,44
What's it usually like here
on match day, on derby day


683
0:26:53,44 --> 0:26:54,34
specifically?


684
0:26:54,34 --> 0:26:57,1
JONNY: Today it will
be busy very early.


685
0:26:57,1 --> 0:26:59,2
There'll be a lot of Celtic
congregating early.


686
0:26:59,2 --> 0:26:59,99
A few beers.


687
0:26:59,99 --> 0:27:1,69
All of us are just excited
about the game ahead.


688
0:27:1,69 --> 0:27:4,34
This is an area of predominantly
all Celtic fans,


689
0:27:4,34 --> 0:27:6,5
republicans, you name it.


690
0:27:6,5 --> 0:27:8,63
KEV KHARAS: Does that kind of
safety that you get here


691
0:27:8,63 --> 0:27:10,79
knowing that you can drink with
Celtic colors on, does


692
0:27:10,79 --> 0:27:11,46
that change on derby day?


693
0:27:11,46 --> 0:27:13,71
Will there be Rangers
lads up here later


694
0:27:13,71 --> 0:27:14,68
looking for a fight?


695
0:27:14,68 --> 0:27:15,46
JONNY: There's every chance.


696
0:27:15,46 --> 0:27:18,6
But I can't remember, in the
last few years, anyway, that


697
0:27:18,6 --> 0:27:21,0
I've drank here that any Ranger
fans or loyalists have


698
0:27:21,0 --> 0:27:23,35
come down here and
achieved that.


699
0:27:23,35 --> 0:27:24,1
Even came down here.


700
0:27:24,1 --> 0:27:26,508
The last thing was a wee story
we spoke about the last time


701
0:27:26,508 --> 0:27:29,1
we met, which was nothing to
with Rangers, may I add.


702
0:27:29,1 --> 0:27:31,26
It was just another bunch of
right-wing fascists that


703
0:27:31,26 --> 0:27:32,52
thought they would come
down here and


704
0:27:32,52 --> 0:27:33,56
start a bit a nonsense.


705
0:27:33,56 --> 0:27:36,21
And they just got a kick up the
backside and sent home.


706
0:27:36,21 --> 0:27:38,52
KEV KHARAS: So what happens if
the Rangers fans do come up


707
0:27:38,52 --> 0:27:40,11
here and they're looking
for a flight, and


708
0:27:40,11 --> 0:27:41,11
the word gets around?


709
0:27:41,11 --> 0:27:41,81
JONNY: Well, this is
the difference.


710
0:27:41,81 --> 0:27:43,45
I mean, looking for a
fight is one thing.


711
0:27:43,45 --> 0:27:45,75
A Rangers fan walking down here
just with a Rangers top


712
0:27:45,75 --> 0:27:47,32
on, nothing would happen.


713
0:27:47,32 --> 0:27:49,5
He wouldn't get dragged off
the streets and brutally


714
0:27:49,5 --> 0:27:50,972
butchered in the middle
of an alleyway.


715
0:27:50,972 --> 0:27:53,2
I'm sure the vast majority of
Rangers fans would just like


716
0:27:53,2 --> 0:27:56,36
to stay in Rangers pubs,
listening to music that


717
0:27:56,36 --> 0:27:58,85
celebrates their culture and
whatnot, as opposed to coming


718
0:27:58,85 --> 0:28:0,86
down here looking for trouble.


719
0:28:0,86 --> 0:28:2,44
KEV KHARAS: Is it good
conditions for a fight today,


720
0:28:2,44 --> 0:28:5,64
with the wind howling and
the rain lashing down?


721
0:28:5,64 --> 0:28:6,89
JONNY: Excellent conditions.

KEV KHARAS: Hi How are
you doing, mate?


725
0:28:30,175 --> 0:28:30,82
You all right?


726
0:28:30,82 --> 0:28:32,45
SANDY: Yeah, soaked.

0:28:32,45 --> 0:28:34,26
KEV KHARAS: How are
you feeling?


728
0:28:34,26 --> 0:28:36,115
SANDY: Nervous, nervous.


729
0:28:36,115 --> 0:28:38,984
It's been three, four days
of anticipation.


730
0:28:38,984 --> 0:28:41,1
So I just can't wait
to get it on.


731
0:28:41,1 --> 0:28:43,41
KEV KHARAS: I read in
your book about--


732
0:28:43,41 --> 0:28:46,47
was it Mr. Blue, when he
stormed the Gallowgate?


733
0:28:46,47 --> 0:28:47,21
Were you there then?


734
0:28:47,21 --> 0:28:48,43
SANDY: Yeah.


735
0:28:48,43 --> 0:28:52,11
Well, basically, we used
to meet in a pub called


736
0:28:52,11 --> 0:28:55,57
Minstrel's down at
the waterfront.


737
0:28:55,57 --> 0:29:0,632
And somebody came up with a
bright idea one day of going


738
0:29:0,632 --> 0:29:1,42
up the Gallowgate.


739
0:29:1,42 --> 0:29:4,72
And anybody that knows the
Gallowgate knows that it's


740
0:29:4,72 --> 0:29:7,54
probably the most no-go
area for Rangers fans.


741
0:29:7,54 --> 0:29:9,61
40 of us decided to
go up one day.


742
0:29:9,61 --> 0:29:11,39
40 turned into 20.


743
0:29:11,39 --> 0:29:12,57
All the Celtic pubs
were emptied.

The Celtic Casuals came out,
your John O'Kanes and that.


745
0:29:16,4 --> 0:29:19,5
John, as usual, was quickly
put on his backside.


746
0:29:19,5 --> 0:29:20,66
But it was pandemonium.


747
0:29:20,66 --> 0:29:21,24
KEV KHARAS: Do you think
there will be


748
0:29:21,24 --> 0:29:22,8
anything like that today?

0:29:22,8 --> 0:29:24,45
SANDY: For any young boy wanting
to get involved in


750
0:29:24,45 --> 0:29:30,0

kind of shake my head with a

KEV KHARAS: So you mentioned
John O'Kane.


759
0:29:46,99 --> 0:29:49,46
SANDY: I mean, I've got a lot of
respect for John as a boy,


760
0:29:49,46 --> 0:29:51,27
because he's a game lad.


761
0:29:51,27 --> 0:29:53,16
He may be put on
his arse a lot.


762
0:29:53,16 --> 0:29:55,74

and wants to have

0:29:55,74 --> 0:29:56,58

0:30:7,86 --> 0:30:8,92
Where abouts in Glasgow?


768
0:30:8,92 --> 0:30:11,95
JOHN: This is Broomielaw,
or Clyde Street.


769
0:30:11,95 --> 0:30:14,0
It was always a good place
for having a battle.


770
0:30:14,0 --> 0:30:15,98
Because of the one-way system
that used to be here, it's


771
0:30:15,98 --> 0:30:17,9
easier to get away
from police.


772
0:30:17,9 --> 0:30:19,13
KEV KHARAS: Have you yourself
been caught up in any trouble


773
0:30:19,13 --> 0:30:20,1
around this area?


774
0:30:20,1 --> 0:30:22,562
JOHN: Well, I could have lost my
life one night here after a


775
0:30:22,562 --> 0:30:23,93
Celtic/Rangers game.


776
0:30:23,93 --> 0:30:25,49
Just around those traffic
lights there.


777
0:30:25,49 --> 0:30:27,93
That's where the Rangers
mob have lined up.


778
0:30:27,93 --> 0:30:28,95
And we've lined up here.


779
0:30:28,95 --> 0:30:30,84
And we've charged
at each other.


780
0:30:30,84 --> 0:30:33,45
I've charged in with
a can of CS gas.


781
0:30:33,45 --> 0:30:33,89
I spayed it.


782
0:30:33,89 --> 0:30:35,485
But there was none left.


783
0:30:35,485 --> 0:30:38,405
And in front of me was a guy
brandishing a knife.


784
0:30:38,405 --> 0:30:42,38
So as I turned, he got me
at the top of the leg.


785
0:30:42,38 --> 0:30:44,57
And I staggered along
the road.


786
0:30:44,57 --> 0:30:45,82
And I fell in a heap.


787
0:30:45,82 --> 0:30:48,575



788
0:30:48,575 --> 0:30:51,27
My trousers were crimson,
basically.


789
0:30:51,27 --> 0:30:53,89
And my mates had
stopped a taxi.


790
0:30:53,89 --> 0:30:55,51
The taxi driver actually
stopped.


791
0:30:55,51 --> 0:30:56,64
And they dragged me in.


792
0:30:56,64 --> 0:30:57,58
And I was like, what's wrong?


793
0:30:57,58 --> 0:30:57,62
What's wrong?


794
0:30:57,62 --> 0:30:59,75
Panicking.


795
0:30:59,75 --> 0:31:1,36
And he took me too hospital.


796
0:31:1,36 --> 0:31:3,21
If he hadn't taken me to
hospital, I had burst a major


797
0:31:3,21 --> 0:31:7,903
artery, and touch wood, I
wouldn't probably be here if


798
0:31:7,903 --> 0:31:10,59
it wasn't for the taxi driver's
quick actions.


799

Again, scary thing.


800
0:31:12,21 --> 0:31:13,75
KEV KHARAS: Do you find that the
trouble nowadays is more


801
0:31:13,75 --> 0:31:16,486
chaotic and less organized
than it used to be?


802
0:31:16,486 --> 0:31:18,205
JOHN: When it comes to
Celtic/Rangers games, yeah.


803
0:31:18,205 --> 0:31:20,33
There seems to be more sporadic
violence, where


804
0:31:20,33 --> 0:31:23,17
you've just got groups of
Rangers and Celtic fans just


805
0:31:23,17 --> 0:31:25,9

at each other.

KEV KHARAS: With kick-off fast
approaching, we traveled to


808
0:31:32,47 --> 0:31:35,6
Denny, 20 miles outside of
Glasgow, where some excited


809
0:31:35,6 --> 0:31:37,14

0:37:51,565 --> 0:37:53,46
And he talks about the Rangers
fans taking the


955
0:37:53,46 --> 0:37:55,56
Gallowgate and stuff.


956
0:37:55,56 --> 0:37:59,215
JOHN: I've not read it.


957
0:37:59,215 --> 0:38:0,72
KEV KHARAS: Have I told you
what he said about you?


958
0:38:0,72 --> 0:38:1,12
JOHN: No.


959
0:38:1,12 --> 0:38:2,74
KEV KHARAS: When I pushed him,
I backed him into a corner.


960
0:38:2,74 --> 0:38:6,0
And he said he'd be quite proud
if you'd grown up a


961
0:38:6,0 --> 0:38:7,345
Rangers fan and been a
member of the ICF.


962
0:38:7,345 --> 0:38:10,61
Because you were always a game
lad, were his words.


963
0:38:10,61 --> 0:38:11,58
JOHN: Aye, but I'm not
going to get a tan.


964
0:38:11,58 --> 0:38:14,255
I'm don't want to get
a fake tan like him.


965
0:38:14,255 --> 0:38:15,97
KEV KHARAS: You know, he said
he respects you and stuff.


966
0:38:15,97 --> 0:38:18,21
But he said that he's suspicious
about where your


967
0:38:18,21 --> 0:38:19,26
tan comes from.


968
0:38:19,26 --> 0:38:20,4
SANDY: [LAUGHS].


969
0:38:20,4 --> 0:38:23,24
KEV KHARAS: He says you spend
too time on sun beds.


970
0:38:23,24 --> 0:38:23,885
SANDY: He might be right.


971
0:38:23,885 --> 0:38:25,886
He might be right, yeah.


972
0:38:25,886 --> 0:38:26,782
[LAUGHTER]


973
0:38:26,782 --> 0:38:29,28
SANDY: I don't think John
O'Kane's seen sunlight, never


974
0:38:29,28 --> 0:38:30,185
mind a sun bed.


975
0:38:30,185 --> 0:38:32,24
I hope he's keeping well.


976
0:38:32,24 --> 0:38:33,76
JOHN: There's people
that there's a


977
0:38:33,76 --> 0:38:34,86
mutual respect between.


978
0:38:34,86 --> 0:38:38,32
But there's other people who
don't have a respect.


979
0:38:38,32 --> 0:38:39,39
They've just got a hatred.


980
0:38:39,39 --> 0:38:40,58
And they want to stab you.


981
0:38:40,58 --> 0:38:41,53
And they want to kill you.


982
0:38:41,53 --> 0:38:42,41
And they want to do
things like that.


983
0:38:42,41 --> 0:38:45,26
If you do them fair enough,
that's what the buzz is about.


984
0:38:45,26 --> 0:38:47,74
It's not about inflicting
pain and harm on people.


985
0:38:47,74 --> 0:38:50,16
It's a big game.


986
0:38:50,16 --> 0:38:52,12
Waking up with a machine that's
going, beep, beep.


987
0:38:52,12 --> 0:38:54,77
And you know when it stops
going beep, you're dead.


988
0:38:54,77 --> 0:38:56,255
It's one of the scariest
things that can


989
0:38:56,255 --> 0:38:56,94
ever happen to anybody.


990
0:38:56,94 --> 0:38:57,66
KEV KHARAS: Has it
happened to you?


991
0:38:57,66 --> 0:38:58,695
JOHN: It's happened twice.


992
0:38:58,695 --> 0:39:1,336
KEV KHARAS: How does that effect
people close to you?


993
0:39:1,336 --> 0:39:4,132



994
0:39:4,132 --> 0:39:6,745
JOHN: It's hard to say.


995
0:39:6,745 --> 0:39:9,79
I think that it did affect
my dad quite a bit.


996
0:39:9,79 --> 0:39:11,1
KEV KHARAS: How about
your own children?


997
0:39:11,1 --> 0:39:14,476
JOHN: Touch wood, they're good
children at the moment.


998
0:39:14,476 --> 0:39:16,76
I wouldn't want them to get
involved in anything like I've


999
0:39:16,76 --> 0:39:17,48
been involved in.


1000
0:39:17,48 --> 0:39:20,146
I want my kids to have
a life that I didn't.


1001
0:39:20,146 --> 0:39:22,335
KEV KHARAS: How about your
missus, or their mother?


1002
0:39:22,335 --> 0:39:27,157



1003
0:39:27,157 --> 0:39:28,882
JOHN: I don't really want
to talk about that.


1004
0:39:28,882 --> 0:39:30,12
KEV KHARAS: OK.


1005
0:39:30,12 --> 0:39:31,96
Pitched street battles between
gangs of screaming men might


1006
0:39:31,96 --> 0:39:34,0
be a thing of the
past in Glasgow.


1007
0:39:34,0 --> 0:39:36,75
But there was still the
issue of the chanting.


1008
0:39:36,75 --> 0:39:38,85
Will Scottish Parliament's new
bill really be able to


1009
0:39:38,85 --> 0:39:41,5
extinguish a loathing
this deep-seated?


1010
0:39:41,5 --> 0:39:42,26
MALE SPEAKER 18: If you look
at the context of the whole


1011
0:39:42,26 --> 0:39:44,75
stadium, the overwhelming
majority of people don't want


1012
0:39:44,75 --> 0:39:45,7
anything to do with it.


1013
0:39:45,7 --> 0:39:46,12
They want to watch
the football.


1014
0:39:46,12 --> 0:39:47,81
Nil By Mouth want to
help the silent


1015
0:39:47,81 --> 0:39:49,27
majority find their voice.


1016
0:39:49,27 --> 0:39:50,57
MALE SPEAKER 27: There's
too many people


1017
0:39:50,57 --> 0:39:51,47
here getting offended.


1018
0:39:51,47 --> 0:39:53,17
They're looking for reasons
to be offended.


1019
0:39:53,17 --> 0:39:55,87
Whether they like it or not,
religious, cultural, and


1020
0:39:55,87 --> 0:39:59,88
national divides will always
be here in Scotland.


1021
0:39:59,88 --> 0:40:1,735
KEV KHARAS: After spending so
many hours in the company of


1022
0:40:1,735 --> 0:40:3,83
people whose thoughts and
feelings are dominated by


1023
0:40:3,83 --> 0:40:6,31
their football clubs, it wasn't
surprising to me that I


1024
0:40:6,31 --> 0:40:8,91
found myself taking
their side.


1025
0:40:8,91 --> 0:40:11,8
To me, it seemed patronizing for
people who weren't fans to


1026
0:40:11,8 --> 0:40:14,11
take their words out of context,
then insist that


1027
0:40:14,11 --> 0:40:15,782
people should take
offense to them.


1028
0:40:15,782 --> 0:40:20,332



1029
0:40:20,332 --> 0:40:23,54
After the win on derby day,
Celtics fans had celebrated as


1030
0:40:23,54 --> 0:40:26,13
if Rangers would never
be top dog again.


1031
0:40:26,13 --> 0:40:28,58
I thought finality like that
didn't exist in football.


1032
0:40:28,58 --> 0:40:31,37
But a few weeks after the game,
Rangers were forced into


1033
0:40:31,37 --> 0:40:33,25
administration by an
unpaid tax bill of


1034
0:40:33,25 --> 0:40:34,99
nine million pounds.


1035
0:40:34,99 --> 0:40:37,29
If they fail to find a rich,
white knight to rescue them


1036
0:40:37,29 --> 0:40:39,88
from the financial mire,
they'll die, taking the


1037
0:40:39,88 --> 0:40:41,88
rivalry with them.


1038
0:40:41,88 --> 0:40:44,4
Celtics fans haven't reacted
to the news with much


1039
0:40:44,4 --> 0:40:45,255
sensitivity.


1040
0:40:45,255 --> 0:40:47,81
I saw this graffiti sprayed over
the side of the Louden


1041
0:40:47,81 --> 0:40:49,98
bar and asked Joe Miller
to explain it.


1042
0:40:49,98 --> 0:40:51,99
What was your immediate reaction
when you hear the


1043
0:40:51,99 --> 0:40:54,21
news that Rangers might
be going bust?


1044
0:40:54,21 --> 0:40:57,61
JOE: Jelly and ice cream was
my immediate reaction.


1045
0:40:57,61 --> 0:40:59,905
KEV KHARAS: Can you explain the
jelly and ice cream thing


1046
0:40:59,905 --> 0:41:0,4
for people who might
not know it?


1047
0:41:0,4 --> 0:41:3,23
JOE: Well, a group of guys
used to always say, we're


1048
0:41:3,23 --> 0:41:4,99
having a party when
Thatcher dies.


1049
0:41:4,99 --> 0:41:7,94
And then it kind of carried on,
jelly and ice cream when


1050
0:41:7,94 --> 0:41:8,74
Thatcher dies.


1051
0:41:8,74 --> 0:41:12,857
And then we went a wee bit
further and went, let's have


1052
0:41:12,857 --> 0:41:14,315
it when Rangers die.


1053
0:41:14,315 --> 0:41:17,4
So jelly and ice cream
when Rangers die.


1054
0:41:17,4 --> 0:41:19,22
Pass the parcel when
Rangers die.


1055
0:41:19,22 --> 0:41:20,43
All that kind of stuff.


1056
0:41:20,43 --> 0:41:22,75
It's good natured.


1057
0:41:22,75 --> 0:41:23,38
MALE SPEAKER 28: Yeah,
jelly and ice cream.


1058
0:41:23,38 --> 0:41:25,23
That's quite appropriate
for Celtic, isn't it?


1059
0:41:25,23 --> 0:41:29,44
Everybody knows about their
cover up of child abuse in the


1060
0:41:29,44 --> 0:41:32,47
early '70s with Jock Stein and
the directors, allegedly.


1061
0:41:32,47 --> 0:41:34,988
KEV KHARAS: What would happen
to this pub if Rangers went


1062
0:41:34,988 --> 0:41:37,73
out of business?


1063
0:41:37,73 --> 0:41:39,825
MALE SPEAKER 28: I would think
we would probably closely


1064
0:41:39,825 --> 0:41:41,75
follow them.


1065
0:41:41,75 --> 0:41:58,666



1066
0:41:58,666 --> 0:42:2,92
ABDUL: If the club's dying and
you're celebrating, it's like


1067
0:42:2,92 --> 0:42:4,165
celebrating the death
of something.


1068
0:42:4,165 --> 0:42:6,62
You know that's sick,
you know?


1069
0:42:6,62 --> 0:42:9,2
But that's the nature of
football fans here in Glasgow.


1070
0:42:9,2 --> 0:42:12,355



1071
0:42:12,355 --> 0:42:13,98
Celtic need Rangers.


1072
0:42:13,98 --> 0:42:16,17
They just think, OK, if Rangers
are closed they can


1073
0:42:16,17 --> 0:42:18,38
laugh at Rangers fans and think
they can win the league


1074
0:42:18,38 --> 0:42:18,96
every season.


1075
0:42:18,96 --> 0:42:21,96
But it will kill Scottish
football, you know.


1076
0:42:21,96 --> 0:42:23,21
We need two clubs.


1077
0:42:23,21 --> 0:42:30,57



1078
0:42:30,57 --> 0:42:32,93
KEV KHARAS: How is the kind
of financial troubles that


1079
0:42:32,93 --> 0:42:33,66
Rangers find themselves in?


1080
0:42:33,66 --> 0:42:36,945
And how has that kind of
effected the mood in the city?


1081
0:42:36,945 --> 0:42:38,575
SANDY: Well, obviously,
one half's delighted.


1082
0:42:38,575 --> 0:42:41,25
And the other half, it's been
like a death in the family.


1083
0:42:41,25 --> 0:42:45,605
I have a few close Celtic fan
mates and a few acquaintances.


1084
0:42:45,605 --> 0:42:48,42
And it's been real relentless.


1085
0:42:48,42 --> 0:42:50,56
It's been really bad.


1086
0:42:50,56 --> 0:42:52,46
KEV KHARAS: I mean, how big a
hole would it leave in your


1087
0:42:52,46 --> 0:42:55,35
own life if Rangers were
to go to the wall?


1088
0:42:55,35 --> 0:42:57,36
SANDY: A massive, gaping hole.


1089
0:42:57,36 --> 0:43:0,0
I've always grown up always
thinking there would always be


1090
0:43:0,0 --> 0:43:2,26
a Rangers for my kids,
for my grand-kids.


1091
0:43:2,26 --> 0:43:4,25
140 years of history.


1092
0:43:4,25 --> 0:43:6,32
We're not going to give
that up all that easy.


1093
0:43:6,32 --> 0:43:7,87
We will fight to the
bitter death.


1094
0:43:7,87 --> 0:43:10,17
But as we say, I'll
follow, follow.


1095
0:43:10,17 --> 0:43:12,6
And I'm sure a great deal of
many thousands will continue


1096
0:43:12,6 --> 0:43:14,31
to follow, follow as well.


1097
0:43:14,31 --> 0:43:15,56
No surrender.


1098
0:43:15,56 --> 0:43:22,45



1099
0:43:22,45 --> 0:43:24,16
KEV KHARAS: Would you miss
them if they want bust?


1100
0:43:24,16 --> 0:43:25,1
JOE: Miss who?


1101
0:43:25,1 --> 0:43:27,2
KEV KHARAS: Rangers.


1102
0:43:27,2 --> 0:43:28,18
JOE: Miss who?


1103
0:43:28,18 --> 0:43:31,44
Loving Celtic doesn't mean
anything about Rangers.


1104
0:43:31,44 --> 0:43:33,18
Nothing about Rangers.


1105
0:43:33,18 --> 0:43:36,5
Loving Celtic only means
loving Celtic.


1106
0:43:36,5 --> 0:43:38,11
ABDUL: I would miss the
Old Firm games.


1107
0:43:38,11 --> 0:43:40,48
To me, that's the biggest
game you can get.


1108
0:43:40,48 --> 0:43:42,87
To me, without a Rangers/Celtic
game, there's


1109
0:43:42,87 --> 0:43:44,606
nothing in Scottish football.


1110
0:43:44,606 --> 0:43:49,96



1111
0:43:49,96 --> 0:43:51,275
KEV KHARAS: I went to
Glasgow an outsider.


1112
0:43:51,275 --> 0:43:53,85
And I still am an outsider.


1113
0:43:53,85 --> 0:43:55,35
But I understand the rivalry
enough to know that the


1114
0:43:55,35 --> 0:43:57,485
cliched, black and white idea
that people have of the Old


1115
0:43:57,485 --> 0:44:1,19
Firm is just ridiculously
wrong.


1116
0:44:1,19 --> 0:44:3,3
There's no doubting that some
pretty hateful things have


1117
0:44:3,3 --> 0:44:5,9
been done in the name
of the rivalry.


1118
0:44:5,9 --> 0:44:7,5
But while it's still here,
it certainly makes


1119
0:44:7,5 --> 0:44:9,87
Glasgow life richer.


1120
0:44:9,87 --> 0:44:11,62
Savage it may be, but
it's become part


1121
0:44:11,62 --> 0:44:13,14
of the city's humor.


1122
0:44:13,14 --> 0:44:15,741
Fans here have spent so long
trying to get under each


1123
0:44:15,741 --> 0:44:18,155
other's skin that the rivalry
is now embedded beneath the


1124
0:44:18,155 --> 0:44:19,81
skin of the city.


1125
0:44:19,81 --> 0:44:22,285
And Glasgow is a city with
a very thick skin.


1126
0:44:22,285 --> 0:46:22,285
