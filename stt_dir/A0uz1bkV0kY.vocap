###0 MATT CUTTS: Today's question comes from Tokyo, Japan.
###3 The question is, you've been sending various kinds of
###6 messages via Webmaster Tools to improve transparency.
###10 It's a good move.
###11 How many types of messages do you send, and how do you
###14 decide what message you send?
###16 Great question.
###17 So I can share a little bit of stats.
###20 At this point, we do send hundreds of thousands of
###23 messages each month.
###24 That might sound like a lot, but for example, one search
###27 engine named Blekko estimated that a million spam pages are
###31 created every hour.
###33 So the web is very large, so it shouldn't be a surprise
###36 that some percentage of it is spam.
###38 And as a result, we do spend a lot of time finding that spam.
###42 And since we automatically send messages and
###45 notifications when we find it, there are a lot, hundreds of
###49 thousands of notifications that we send out each month.
###52 There's a lot of different categories of spam.
###54 They're covered in our Webmaster Guidelines,
###55 everything from cloaking to scraping to sneaky JavaScript
###59 redirects, paid links, all sorts of stuff.
###62 But all of those boil down to roughly about 10 different
###66 messages that we send.
###68 So hidden text, keyword stuffing, gibberish, all that
###71 would go into one message that we send out.
###73 I can share some stats from earlier this year, from
###76 January and February.
###78 Out of the hundreds of thousands of messages that we
###80 sent over that time period, roughly 90% of those were for
###84 what we call Black Hat.
###85 That's pure, egregious spam, clear cut, anybody
###89 sufficiently tech savvy would probably be able to recognize
###91 that it's spam.
###92 It's the stuff that you think of as traditional junk that
###95 you just don't want to show up in your results because it is
###98 very clearly spam.
###101 About 4% of the messages were because the content had little
###105 or no added value, and so it's not ranking as highly in our
###108 search results.
###110 About 3% of the messages that we sent
###112 were related to hacking.
###113 So hacking is a big attack as far as Black Hats.
###117 And even though it's illegal, there's a lot of people that
###119 do that-- trying to promote their pharmacy pills or
###122 whatever, that sort of thing.
###124 So about 3% of those messages were related to hacking.
###127 Something like 2% of the messages that we sent out were
###130 related to link buying, and about 1% were
###132 related to link selling.
###133 So overall between 2% and 3% related to links and link spam
###138 overall about buying and selling links.
###140 So that gives you a broad idea of the sorts of categories
###143 that we send things out for and the rough number of
###147 messages that we send out each month.
###148
