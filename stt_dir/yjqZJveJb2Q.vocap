###0 all volunteers who told you about the drone program in the killers that
###3 president obama has and how ridges that is well we now have a memo that confirms
###8 exactly how bad we thought it was
###11 and of course uh... previous reports came from weeks within the white house
###14 that's what we believe that they were
###16 true in terms of reporting it 'cause it was the white house bragging about it
###20 all now
###20 michael's a couple of n_b_c_ news has the white papers a sixteen page memo
###24 that justifies killing u_s_ citizens would throw strikes
###28 so
###30 is it as they
###31 is short of something that they knew all in the most dire circumstances and
###36 somebody's about the launch against the united act out a few why dot we have to
###41 take out the sitting quietly important
###44 are clearly
###45 as you read the memo to becomes obvious that of course that's not what happened
###50 so let me begin quoting it too
###52 the threat posed by allocated a explain
###54 and its associated forces demands a broader concept of p
###60 imminence in judging what a person continually planning terror attacks
###64 presents
###68 i love lawyerly language he had a sale that means
###70 i'm is an eminent thread
###72 does it mean an imminent threat
###74 it doesn't have to be immediate
###76 except threat
###78 whenever
###80 as long as somebody in the executive branch is decided
###83 yelling all like that guy he might be someone at some point
###86 big is asap
###88 now here are the so-called limitations
###91 it does not require the u_s_
###93 to have information about a specific imminent but i guess the u_s_
###97 uh... that those of a limitation this seems like the exact opposite
###101 simple go-ahead bombs away number two
###104 it requires that they can to return a suspect
###107 not be feasible
###108 but as a memo explains later
###110 or be in undue burden on our troops
###114 well he now would have been impaired and trying to capture that guy
###118 or perhaps at post country didn't agree
###121 so we excuse somebody within the host country because it was an undue burden
###125 okay
###126 and number three
###127 operation complies with the fundamental law of war principles
###131 and that's where it's
###132 as a whole memo violates the law war principles
###135 but it says at the end worried
###137 were following the law war principles why
###140 because we said so
###142 now new laws of war allow you to
###144 excuse someone
###145 who is not an imminent threat
###147 and not on the battlefield and not the jury came in many ways
###153 now
###154 they don't
###155 but we just said they did so trust us where the government
###159 mhm i don't think so
###161 so uh... that
###162 that leads to while who's in making this decision while don't worry we've got
###166 more information on that
###167 is a cough explained several different quotes put together her from the white
###171 paper
###172 and informed
###173 high-level officials their forbidden of course the was right
###177 and for my little official of the u_s_ government
###180 may determine did the targeted american has been
###183 recently involved in activities
###187 posing a threat of violence that
###189 and there is no evidence suggesting that he has renounced or abandoned such
###194 activities
###196 so women high-level official within the imperial government
###200 who has decided that you
###201 have some activities at some point
###204 well the reason is not defined
###207 that uh... is a cause of concern for us
###209 and as far as we know
###212 you're not rebels those things that we found somewhat suspicious
###216 this doesn't involve you get interested in we finding out
###219 hey you know what what were those activities and what were you planning
###221 certainly this involves your execution
###225 now remember during the bush years they used to have a euphemism for torture was
###228 enhanced interrogation
###230 we fought a long battle to make sure it was called a was torture
###233 now
###234 these are not executions there targeted killings
###238 all r_t_c_
###241 no here's what they are
###242 assassinations
###244 and executions
###245 these are you would have said is is remembered for u_s_ citizens
###248 have already been assassinated
###250 including as sixteen-year-old
###253 that was the branches are all walked these slander
###257 and one robert gibbs was asked about it
###259 former white house spokesperson he said well then they should know who they're
###263 associating with
###265 but he was an associating with an that was is that it wasn't even in the same
###268 strike
###269 it was in a different strike
###273 but trust the government don't worrying what we execute
###277 sixteen year old u_s_ citizens
###279 i'm sure we had a good reason
###281 that since there was another threat well
###283 your physician any information about the strike
###286 well we continue here with this of
###289 orwellian words a decision maker determining
###293 whether al qaeda operational leader presents an imminent threat a violent
###296 act against the united states must take into account that certain numbers of al
###300 qaeda are continually plotting attacks against the united states
###305 units and i want
###308 we don't have to have information that they attack is imminent or immediate or
###311 any such thing
###312 ever understand it had been al-qaeda
###315 they're constantly planning
###317 so we can tell them that anytime
###319 because we have seen they were
###321 they are in mid-atlantic
###324 how've much broader can this possibly be
###327 if you allow the president to do this
###329 what won't you allowed to do
###332 these are u_s_ citizens there excuse me
###335 al-qaeda would engage in such a tax relief
###337 to accept that they were able to do so
###340 this is from amma
###342 in other words
###344 well
###345 what it might not have particular evidence in this case
###347 but trust us iftikhar they work be attacking us that's what we come up with
###353 a chance to
###355 well that's great
###356 so we're actually u_s_ citizens abroad
###359 based on three crops
###361 but trust the government we've got a good man in charge oquawka hunter got
###364 maggie he would make a mistake worried
###367 he won be malicious about this
###369 that's what we trust the cake that's what he has arctic ordained by god
###374 all-white he's supposed to be a president
###376 now we're supposed to be a democracy we settle messed up back in a magna carta
###380 they're setting us back
###381 aids under two years bush did it
###384 all but i was going at once
###385 was never executed u_s_ citizens like this
###388 dick cheney thought now that's a bridge to fall
###392 and now a part of the way
###393 yes bush
###394 stardust femina strode yes he said the entire planet as a battlefield which is
###399 outrageous which means a tissue people on-site basically because all i have an
###403 imminent danger everything's a battlefield obama took at at what a step
###407 further
###408 the memo continues
###410 the u_s_ government may not be aware of al qaeda plots as they're developing and
###414 those cannot be cabinet
###415 that none is about the car
###418 all for christ sake when you thought it could be anywhere
###421 we're not confident that a plot is not happening
###425 so we decided to executed u_s_ citizen
###428 artist verdict might be happening
###434 all the political will
###435 and yet it continues
###438 a lawful killing in self defense the memo explains
###442 is not an assassination
###444 are well when you put it that way
###446 i didn't know your acting in self-defense just in case the guy was
###450 going to do something else that's
###452 but we're not really sure about
###454 but yet security before he had a chance to do it
###456 well then that would make a lawful killing right because the courts to
###459 decide
###461 no judicial review
###462 ne for america's excuse so far
###465 had a trial or you've been any due process in terms of the judiciary we
###470 never went to the judiciary
###472 it would just that budget reducing the executive department deciding that you
###475 know what
###476 we'll talk to you that seems like due process the guys i hired to work for me
###480 as lawyers have agreed that i can tell that guy
###483 well are you not possible you check with the guys you hire whose project depends
###487 on and and bring with you
###489 and of course are
###490 beloved attorney general eric holder
###492 summarize all this
###493 earlier in a speech that he made last year
###496 depressants
###497 ten judicial process for another one in the same particularly when it comes to
###502 national security the constitution guarantees due process
###507 he does not guarantee judicial process
###511 stephen colbert joke crown about of said well
###514 it could be a process of
###516 brock reverses
###517 could be a trial by fire
###519 ways that you will recall our this is not process
###522 the new processes for a while back together on this edition retail acti
###526 got bad luck
###527 after due process
