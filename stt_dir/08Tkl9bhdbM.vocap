###6 Greetings, I am Michael Jivets, Producer on World of Tanks
###24 What’s the reason for implementing 3 player platoons in tank companies for non-premium accounts in the 8.5 update?
###33 We’re continuing to reduce the impact of gold and how it influences the game experience, and that’s why we’ve decided to introduce these new features.
###42 Forum users have actively discussed a new plan of being able to buy premium equipment for credits.
###47 Is this currently an experiment?
###49 Yes, it is, just like buying premium shells for credits was an experiment.
###54 What about buying experience with credits?
###56 Will this ever happen?
###57 No, this will never happen. That’s for certain.
###60 How will the light Soviet tanks introduced in the 8.5 update influence the Т-50 and Т-50-2?
###66 Perhaps these vehicles will become slightly less popular.
###70 But their gameplay will not be influenced at all. Simply because this line will not compete with the Т-50 and Т50-2.
###78 The Т-50-2 is still going to be a top tier light Soviet tank.
###83 Can players expect to see new premium vehicles in the 8.5 update?
###88 Yes. This update we will add a new premium British SPG, the Sexton 1.
###94 Do you plan to make any changes or corrections to the game mechanics in the 8.5 update?
###100 Yes, we’re going to correct some old and recently arisen errors that may have be obvious to some of our players.
###106 For example, having artillery’s high-explosive shells detonate in the air. This bug was detected in the 8.4 update. As it is right
###114 now, the explosion is not shown in the area where it actually happens.
###118 The shell can still hit a tank and explode, but a player will see it happen 10 to 15 meters above the tank.
###126 We’ll also correct another feature regarding HE shells. Right now, when a high-explosive shell hits a destroyed tank, it causes no
###134 splash damage to the nearby tanks.
###137 Now, with the 8.5 update, after hitting a destroyed tank with a high-explosive shell, it will cause splash damage as if it hit the ground near the tank.
###146 They say the speed of IS-7 will be increased from 50 to 60 km per hour.
###151 Is that true?
###153 Yes, it will happen. It’s not a rumor.
###155 We’ll be increasing the maximum speed of the IS-7 to 60 km per hour.
###159 Can we expect any new premium Chinese tanks?
###163 We’ll be adding new premium tanks, including high-tier Chinese vehicles around tier eight.
###169 What about tier eight heavy Chinese tank, like the WZ-111? Will that make an appearance?
###175 There are no plans to put that tank in the store.
###178 It’s possible our players may see it appear during special events.
###182 Are there any details you can share about the 8.6 update?
###185 The 8.6 update will feature many changes.
###190 The most important of which will be the expansion of the SPG line, up to tier 10.
###196 When testing the 8.5 update, many players noticed the new tier 10 heavy tanks.
###201 What’s the status of these particular vehicles?
###204 These are not premium vehicles and they can’t be bought in the store.
###209 Also, these tanks can’t be researched; they are not included in tech trees.
###213 These vehicles will be special high-tier content for players�
