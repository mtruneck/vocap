###24 ELLIOTT BAMBROUGH: We're in Tokyo right now.
###24 Everyone's well aware of the subcultures and fetishes that
###27 exist here.
###28 That's inside the city, happening around me right now.
###30 But outside the city there's another subculture.
###33 It's called Dekotora.
###35 Basically it's Pimp My Ride for trucks.
###37 And these huge Transformer-esque type things
###39 with neon lights and murals and chandeliers.
###42 And our mission while we're here is to meet the guys who
###45 started it.
###46 For all these different missions I'm going to have
###48 someone along with me, who I'm going to call my co-pilot.
###50 And you're going to meet her tomorrow.
###51 But for now, I'm going head round Tokyo and try and soak
###54 this all up.
###55 
###71 So I told you guys that we're going to have a co-pilot along
###73 for the ride and it's Maggie Stoody.
###75 Can I call you Maggie?
###76 MAGGIE STOODY: You can.
###76 Thank you.
###77 ELLIOTT BAMBROUGH: It's Mags.
###78 What do you want?
###79 MAGGIE STOODY: Oh, it all looks so appetizing.
###81 ELLIOTT BAMBROUGH: So you want to be crazy kickboxer
###82 or upset pork man.
###83 What do you want to be?
###84 MAGGIE STOODY: I think I'm going to go crazy kickboxer.
###88 ELLIOTT BAMBROUGH: It's hot.
###89 It's hot, pre-warmed pork noodles.
###92 
###100 What do you do when you're not in Tokyo or going out to
###102 discover Dekotora trucks?
###103 MAGGIE STOODY: I am a Chicagoan.
###105 I travel a lot.
###106 Just got back from Ecuador a couple weeks ago.
###108 ELLIOTT BAMBROUGH: Sweet.
###108 What were you doing in Ecuador?
###109 MAGGIE STOODY: Just bumming around.
###110 And my brother and I are starting a
###112 small sunglasses company.
###114 And a portion of our profits go to eradicating vitamin A
###117 deficiency which is a huge world health crisis that not
###120 that many people know about.
###121 ELLIOTT BAMBROUGH: OK cool.
###122 MAGGIE STOODY: Yeah.
###123 So I know we're on the mission to find Dekotora trucks but I
###127 have to admit I don't really know what they are.
###129 MAGGIE STOODY: Dekotora trucks basically
###130 means decorated truck.
###132 It all starts off these guys, just ordinary truck drivers,
###135 start a whole new subculture.
###137 In '74, there's a production company and the guy was
###140 working there, saw one of these Dekotora trucks, was
###143 inspired and fascinated by it and started off this whole
###147 sub-genre of movies about truck guys.
###149 And the first one's called Truck Rascals.
###150 
###159 They formed a group of Dekotora truck drivers to make
###163 it easier for the production company.
###165 It really exploded and other groups started forming around
###168 the country and it became a big thing.
###170 It's really dwindling.
###171 You don't see Dekotora trucks in Tokyo anymore.
###174 We're going to bump into the newer
###176 generation of Dekotora drivers.
###178 MAGGIE STOODY: Cool.
###178 ELLIOTT BAMBROUGH: See them with their pimped out rides
###180 and just hanging.
###180 MAGGIE STOODY: Cool.
###181 I can't wait to hang.
###181 ELLIOTT BAMBROUGH: Just hanging with
###182 the big white trucks.
###183 
###187 We're on our way to Gunma in Central Japan, about two hours
###190 west of Tokyo.
###192 We're supposed to meet with one of the old school original
###195 Dekotora truck drivers.
###196 His name is Taguchi San and he's been in the scene for the
###199 last three decades.
###200 We're going to find out a little bit more about the
###202 history of Dekotora and how it started.
###204 MAGGIE STOODY: Thank you for having us.
###205 
###278 MAGGIE STOODY: Thank you.
###278 ELLIOTT BAMBROUGH: Thank you so much.
###280 Arigato.
###281 
###289 ELLIOTT BAMBROUGH: We're in Gunma.
###290 Behind me is the Dekotora store, and this kind of acts
###293 as a truck stop for guys.
###294 There's a diner over there.
###295 Or the guys stop here and they get a tune up as well.
###297 But this is also where they get all their supplies for
###299 Dekotora, the lights and the neons, and the horns.
###301 And we're going to go inside now and go and check it out.
###303 
###309 MAGGIE STOODY: Enormous.
###309 ELLIOTT BAMBROUGH: The bombardment on your senses
###311 with all the flashing lights and everything and everything.
###314 MAGGIE STOODY: Whoa, it's so big.
###315 ELLIOTT BAMBROUGH: From decorating the outside to the
###317 chandeliers to the upholstery, anything you can get for the
###320 truck is here in this store.
###323 MAGGIE STOODY: A little unicorn action for ya.
###326 ELLIOTT BAMBROUGH: Here's your--
###327 MAGGIE STOODY: Wow!
###328 ELLIOTT BAMBROUGH: Your finishing
###328 touches, your grills.
###329 MAGGIE STOODY: Look at these little guys.
###331 
###334 It's an enormous key chain.
###335 I already know how I would do my Dekotora.
###338 Murder out the outside, matte black finish, and then all
###342 sparkle black on the inside.
###344 [GASP]
###344 These!
###346 Ridin' dirty.
###347 ELLIOTT BAMBROUGH: You can take your Lil Wayne Dekotora
###349 and you can shove it.
###350 MAGGIE STOODY: I really would too.
###351 Like you could go grandma's Dekotora.
###353 
###363 ELLIOTT BAMBROUGH: This is just crazy.
###365 MAGGIE STOODY: So cool.
###365 ELLIOTT BAMBROUGH: The fact that we have three lined up
###366 and with the sun bouncing off of them, with all the silver.
###369 MAGGIE STOODY:The bling.
###370 Disco balls.
###371 ELLIOTT BAMBROUGH: And everything glimmering.
###372 MAGGIE STOODY: It's so beautiful.
###372 ELLIOTT BAMBROUGH: And here are the guys.
###374 SEKINO SAN: My name is Sekino.
###375 ELLIOTT AND MAGGIE: Sekino, nice to meet you.
###376 ELLIOTT BAMBROUGH: Nice to meet you.
###377 Thank you.
###378 MAGGIE STOODY: Thank you.
###379 ELLIOTT BAMBROUGH: Where do you even start with getting
###381 the stuff on?
###383 
###410 ELLIOTT BAMBROUGH: The murals on the side, how did he pick
###412 this one out and who commissioned it?
###414 Who painted it?
###417 ERINA SUTO: He painted it himself.
###418 MAGGIE STOODY: Wow.
###418 ELLIOTT BAMBROUGH: You did it yourself?
###419 MAGGIE STOODY: So beautiful.
###421 
###424 ELLIOTT BAMBROUGH: Is it rude to ask him how much he spent
###427 all together?
###428 If he could estimate.
###429 
###434 ELLIOTT BAMBROUGH: Does he have it specifically insured
###436 for that amount?
###439 ERINA SUTO: No insurance.
###440 
###454 ELLIOTT BAMBROUGH: Does he have any idea how many light
###455 bulbs are in this?
###456 
###462 ELLIOTT BAMBROUGH: Oh, sweet.
###462 So it's a cool little cabin.
###464 MAGGIE STOODY: Wow.
###466 ELLIOTT BAMBROUGH: So it's life a home away from home.
###468 TV.
###469 Stereo.
###469 MAGGIE STOODY: Chandelier.
###471 ELLIOTT BAMBROUGH: Imagine the guys sitting here playing
###472 poker, having a few beers.
###475 
###493 MAGGIE STOODY: So maybe they'll Dekotora our Mini?
###496 We can be part of the club?
###498 ELLIOTT BAMBROUGH: That's a good idea.
###499 MAGGIE STOODY: Yeah?
###500 ELLIOTT BAMBROUGH: Yeah?
###501 MAGGIE STOODY: All right.
###501 ELLIOTT BAMBROUGH: Thank you so much.
###503 MAGGIE STOODY: And thanks for letting us see your truck.
###505 It's beautiful.
###506 Arigato.

###568 ELLIOTT BAMBROUGH: We've just been told that the Mini has
###569 now been Dekotora'd so it's time to go in the workshop and
###572 get it out.
###573 
###579 They're going to town with it, I love it.
###583 Now you guys know a little bit more about Dekotora.
###585 Right now I'm off to the next adventure.
