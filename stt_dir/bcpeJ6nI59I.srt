0:0:20,8 --> 0:0:23,13
My name is Dr. Tierney Thys 


2
0:0:23,13 --> 0:0:25,419
I am a National Geographic Explorer,


3
0:0:25,419 --> 0:0:28,97
marine biologist and filmmaker.


4
0:0:28,97 --> 0:0:32,5
My work has taken me all over the world ocean.


5
0:0:32,5 --> 0:0:34,76
From coral reefs in the tropics


6
0:0:34,76 --> 0:0:37,57
And the kelp forests off California


7
0:0:37,57 --> 0:0:41,11
to the frigid waters of Antarctica.


8
0:0:41,11 --> 0:0:45,9
I've studied life in the sea from some of the biggest fishes


9
0:0:45,9 --> 0:0:49,76
to some of the tiniest organisms in the drifting world of plankton.


10
0:0:49,76 --> 0:0:52,53
From this time underwater, 


11
0:0:52,53 --> 0:0:56,42
I've come to see our planet through a new lens.


12
0:0:56,42 --> 0:1:0,689
We live on a water planet where 99%


13
0:1:0,689 --> 0:1:4,95
of the available living space lies in the ocean.


14
0:1:4,95 --> 0:1:6,82
All the water in our bodies,


15
0:1:6,82 --> 0:1:10,55
our eyes, our skin, our blood 


16
0:1:10,55 --> 0:1:16,24
once resided in the ocean and will return one day to the sea.  


17
0:1:16,24 --> 0:1:18,27
Water is the one element 


18
0:1:18,27 --> 0:1:24,45
that connects us all so deeply-so profoundly.  


19
0:1:24,45 --> 0:1:29,26
Here is where life began nearly 4 billion years ago and it's been honing 


20
0:1:29,26 --> 0:1:33,25
its survival tactics ever since. 


21
0:1:33,25 --> 0:1:37,24
We've explored less than 5% of this ancient realm.


22
0:1:37,24 --> 0:1:43,5
And now we're entering a true golden age of discovery in the ocean.  


23
0:1:43,5 --> 0:1:50,52
Nearly 50% of the oxygen we breathe comes from hidden world of ocean microbes.


24
0:1:50,52 --> 0:1:57,35
Their intricate processes are crucial for life on Earth. 


25
0:1:57,35 --> 0:2:2,64
I am constantly in awe of the ingenuity and tenacity of ocean life. 


26
0:2:2,64 --> 0:2:5,21
How it manages to withstand the relentless


27
0:2:5,21 --> 0:2:7,39
and powerful energy of the waves, 


28
0:2:7,39 --> 0:2:10,429
Extreme changes in temperature 


29
0:2:10,429 --> 0:2:14,349
How so much diversity can thrive with nothing to latch on to,


30
0:2:14,349 --> 0:2:18,26
nowhere to hide. 


31
0:2:18,26 --> 0:2:22,5
It's in these salty waters that I know the most profound secrets 


32
0:2:22,5 --> 0:2:26,759
of the biological world still lie. 


33
0:2:26,759 --> 0:2:30,519
If we can take care of the ocean and the life within,


34
0:2:30,519 --> 0:2:34,389
we can unlock the keys to so many more discoveries


35
0:2:34,389 --> 0:2:36,559
discoveries in science, 


36
0:2:36,559 --> 0:2:39,339
medicine, food, 


37
0:2:39,339 --> 0:2:40,9
energy...


38
0:2:40,9 --> 0:2:43,789
our own survival. 


39
0:2:43,789 --> 0:2:49,709
As a biologist, explorer, filmmaker and mother,


40
0:2:49,709 --> 0:4:49,709
the ocean is the greatest gift I could ever ask for.
