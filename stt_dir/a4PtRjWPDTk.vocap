###0 MALE SPEAKER: Thank you.
###0 MALE SPEAKER: Lost his balance on the--
###2 MALE SPEAKER: So hard to get the fucking board
###3 to do what I want.
###4 LIZARD KING: Passion.
###7 MALE SPEAKER: So when did he first start talking about
###8 wanting to do mega jump?
###10 JAKE BROWN: I think he actually just came up with it
###12 the day before he was going to do it or something.
###13 Or maybe that night, like, he was partying.
###17 And then he just randomly went and did it.
###20 LIZARD KING: I'm just fucking super wasted, talking shit,
###23 saying that I'd go there and do it and fucking--
###25 MALE SPEAKER: What, did you run into
###26 him at a bar or something?
###28 LIZARD KING: Yeah, I was down in Hensley's bar down south.
###31 One night, I was just talking shit to all those fools.
###33 And the next thing I know, PLG fucking pulls up at like 10:00
###36 in the morning and drove me to Bob's house.
###37 It's just, like, still high as fuck on ecstasy, just sitting
###41 there, like, what the fuck?
###43 I think I maybe slept for 30 minutes or something.
###46 MALE SPEAKER: So they just thought you were
###47 claiming it, so?
###48 LIZARD KING: Yeah, I pretty much got fucking put in my
###50 place, like, all right, here it is.
###53 Fucking, let's put your mouth where your fucking shit is.
###56 PIERRE LUC GAGNON: I set him up with a board and some pads.
###59 At first he was claiming he was going to do it without
###61 pads, but we were kind of like, dude, you've been up all
###65 night, take it easy.
###66 Maybe you should just warm up with kneepads, at least, and
###69 then when you get comfortable, take your pads off.
###72 LIZARD KING: Dude, when I got there, Bob's like, it's
###74 nothing, dude, try it.
###75 Check it out.
###76 He goes up, no pads, nothing, just grabs his board, drops
###79 in, jumps the gap, and just lands on his butt, looking at
###81 me, talking at me.
###83 He's like dude, it's easy.
###84 You got it, like sliding on his ass.
###86 MALE SPEAKER: Any quotes, Bob?
###88 BOB: He's making it right now.
###90 No big deal.
###90 It's Lizard King.
###91 MALE SPEAKER: Do it first shot.
###92 You fucking got it.
###93 BOB: All right.
###95 LIZARD KING: Slash drove me up to the top.
###97 And we got up there and looking down, I was fucking
###99 shitting myself.
###101 PIERRE LUC GAGNON: And it was pretty crazy, because he was
###102 super hung over.
###104 And before he even tried, he threw up.
###107 He was puking, because he was kind of like nervous and hung
###110 over at the same time.
###112 LIZARD KING: Fucking scared shitless.
###116 MALE SPEAKER: How far was the gap that you made?
###118 LIZARD KING: I think it's like 50 feet,
###120 or 55 feet, or something.
###122 Dude, yeah, it's nuts.
###124 And the way it's built, too, it's like a step-up.
###127 You know what I mean?
###128 So the whole time you're rolling up to it, it looks
###130 like you're going to just fucking run into a green
###132 plywood wall.
###133 Like, if you hit that, you just fall into a net.
###136 And the net is sketchy as fuck.
###139 PIERRE LUC GAGNON: I mean, for me, jumping down 15 stairs is
###142 way gnarlier than jumping the mega ramp.
###144 So I was like, yeah, if he can do shit like that, he can
###147 definitely do the mega ramp.
###149 I've seen guys do back flips over the mega ramp, just like
###152 looping out because they'd be in the backseat.
###155 This guy John Schultes, used to be a pro skater, he got so
###158 scared he was like leaning back.
###160 And he did a perfect back flip into a knee slide.
###164 It's like the most insane footage you've ever seen.
###167 So yeah, I was telling Lizard all those stories.
###170 And he was pretty hyped on them.
###172 Then tried it maybe, like, 5 to 10 more tries, and pulled
###176 it, like full pull.
###178 
###182 [CHEERING]
###186 MALE SPEAKER: That was a make.
###188 PIERRE LUC GAGNON: Dude, that was the fastest, probably
###191 fastest make I've ever seen.
###193 [CHEERING]
###196 PIERRE LUC GAGNON: Congrats.
###198 LIZARD KING: Wow, that shit is so tight.
###200 PIERRE LUC GAGNON: After I took him out to the mega ramp,
###202 we were drinking this one night.
###204 And he was, like, dude, I'm fucking getting "PLG" tattooed
###208 on my wrist.
###209 And I'm like, yeah right, you're just drunk.
###211 I was like, yeah, whatever Lizard.
###213 Then the text came in that said, I told you, son.
###216 And it was like the ghettoist tattoo of just like
###219 "PLG" on his wrist.
###221 Thrasher did the little feature on it.
###224 The article kind of ended, it was like, oh yeah, it'd be mad
###228 passion if PL would get a Lizard tattoo.
###230 LIZARD KING: PLG got a big ass lizard right here holding a
###234 flag that says "passion" on it.
###236 [LAUGH].
###239 PIERRE LUC GAGNON: It's like one of his board graphics,
###241 actually, so.
###242 MALE SPEAKER: [LAUGH].
###244 MALE SPEAKER: And then you have a Laced one?
###247 LIZARD KING: Yeah, because I was
###248 partying with Jake Browning.
###249 It was like, we stayed at his house.
###251 I just got all fucked up.
###252 Did a bunch of coke, and a bunch of ecstasy, and shit,
###254 and had some dude come over and give me that one.
###257 [LAUGH].
###259 MALE SPEAKER: Wait, what's Laced, is that your company?
###260 JAKE BROWN: Yeah.
###262 MALE SPEAKER: What is it?
###263 JAKE BROWN: It's a clothing thing me, Smolik,
###265 and Sheffey are doing.
###266 We'd been drinking all night or whatever and then he's
###269 like, I'm down, I'm going to go get a Laced tattoo.
###271 We're like, yeah, right, all right, see you tomorrow.
###273 He shows up the next day, he's like, check it out, fool.
###275 [LAUGH].
###275 Like, dude, this fool's beat us to the market
###278 shit on our own shit.
###280 [LAUGH].
###280 He's a fireball, man, just hanging out
###282 with the dude, he's--
###284 you never know what's going to happen next.
###285 He's like, 100%.
###289 PIERRE LUC GAGNON: There was a contest when I was at the
###291 Harmony Festival.
###292 And it's this big hippy fest.
###295 Just like people taking shrooms, and
###298 doing acid, and shit.
###299 And Lizard was going to judge a contest.
###301 And next thing you know, Lizard's nowhere to be found,
###304 just tripping all weekend.
###306 He ended up trying to judge a contest, but all I remember
###310 hearing was Neil Hendrix telling me that Lizard fell
###313 asleep halfway through the contest.
###315 He was judging, and then halfway through, he was like,
###319 that was fucking gnarly, and just fell asleep.
###321
