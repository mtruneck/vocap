###0 bjbjLULU JEFFREY BROWN: Hari Sreenivasan takes the story from there. HARI SREENIVASAN: Just
###6 what are the consequences of such explosive growth? The PBS NewsHour, in partnership with
###11 the Pulitzer Center and National Geographic, has been covering that for the past year.
###16 We have explored how the composition of our society is changing. We are becoming a more
###21 urban population. Mega-cities, those with more than 10 million residents, are booming.
###26 In 1975, there were only three such places. Now there are more than 21. Fred de Sam Lazaro
###32 reported from New Delhi last December. FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Jyoti Sharma, a conservation
###37 activist who runs a small aid agency, says the city is simply overwhelmed. JYOTI SHARMA,
###42 water activist: Every year, we get an additional .5 to .7 million people. That's the net addition
###47 to the city. FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Seven hundred thousand people every year? JYOTI SHARMA:
###50 Seven hundred thousand people, yes. A majority of this growth is of people who are poor.
###55 And they typically come and settle in these kind of settlements. Only 27 percent of the
###59 city is actually a planned city. The rest of it has just grown like this. And you cannot
###64 stop them from coming, because that's the only place they will get some livelihood from.
###68 HARI SREENIVASAN: Babies born today enter a world where 13 percent of the population
###73 doesn't have access to clean drinking water. That was the subject of Steve Sapienza's report
###78 in march from Dhaka, Bangladesh. STEVE SAPIENZA: If you want to see the human toll exacted
###83 by unsafe water and poor sanitation in Dhaka, you come here. This is the overflow tent at
###89 the short-stay unit at Dhaka's main cholera and diarrhea hospital. This man arrived at
###95 the hospital with no vital signs. After 15 minutes of trying to revive him, his wife
###100 is given the news. The staff reports cholera as the cause of death. HARI SREENIVASAN: But
###107 while the overall number continues to rise, in places like Brazil, family sizes are shrinking.
###113 In August, Fred de Sam Lazaro outlined some of the forces changing fertility rates there.
###117 FRED DE SAM LAZARO: Eighty percent of women of childbearing age use contraception. At
###121 the same time, a robust economy has needed their labor. Today, women make up 40 percent
###127 of the country's work force up and down the economic ladder. The majority of college graduates
###133 in Brazil are women. HARI SREENIVASAN: To see many more images, you can download the
###137 National Geographic 7 Billion app for the iPad. For more now on what a seven billion-person
###142 world might mean, we are joined by Azza Karam, a senior adviser at the U.N.'s Population
###147 Fund, and Dennis Dimick. He is the executive editor of environment at National Geographic
###152 magazine, our partner in world population coverage. So, Dennis, let me start with you.
###156 What are the implications of a 7 billion-person world? You have been looking at these stories
###160 all year. DENNIS DIMICK, National Geographic magazine: Well, I think the idea that 7 billion
###163 is really just a spot on a trajectory that we're all on. And if it's laid out, we were
###169 at 6 billion just a few years ago, and by 2025, we will be at 8 billion. So, really,
###175 what it is, it really gives us an opportunity not so much just to talk about 7 billion,
###179 but what does that mean and what are the kind of challenges that we all face as we go forward
###184 to try to fulfill the needs of everybody on the planet? HARI SREENIVASAN: Now, Azza Karam,
###190 it's a nice round number that gets our attention. So now you have it. What should we be focused
###194 on? AZZA KARAM, United Nations Population Fund: We should be focused both on the challenges
###198 that this represents, as well as on the opportunities, because there is no way that it is only a
###203 litany of challenges. It certainly is a matter of access to resources. More people means
###208 more pressure on already rare resources, from the air we breathe, the water we drink, the
###213 food we eat. It literally is a great deal more demand than there may well be supply.
###221 But at the same time, we have to balance that perspective by looking at the opportunities
###226 that 7 billion presents in terms of the most amazing amount of human power that this Earth
###234 has ever seen, and especially given the technology that is being evolving as we speak, especially
###241 communication technologies, but also the technologies of the better use of resources that we're
###246 all trying to harvest. The fact that there will be 1.8 billion of that 7 billion is young
###254 people, which is a remarkable potential, as we're seeing every day unfold in terms its
###261 of new strategies for seeking demand. And one of the challenges and also an opportunity
###267 is the fact that we have a lot more women who will be hard-pressed as heads of households
###273 to make ends meet, but, at the same time, a lot more women in the labor force who are
###278 in positions of decision-making. So I think we need to make sure we keep that balanced
###282 perspective all the time. HARI SREENIVASAN: Dennis, as one of the stories we profiled
###286 showed, the rate of population growth isn't the same all over the world. In fact, the
###292 U.N. says that 42 percent of the population on Earth is not replacing itself generation
###298 after generation -- 40 percent is and maybe a little bit more. And then there is another
###301 18 percent that's rapidly growing. What are these disparities about? DENNIS DIMICK: So,
###306 what we see in large measure is, in northern latitude countries -- in fact, we're seeing
###311 -- across Europe and Japan, we're actually seeing a fertility rate -- that's the number
###315 of children born per women that reach childbearing age -- is actually less than replacement.
###320 And so we are seeing aging populations across Europe and in Japan. So we don't have the
###326 young people coming into the society that do things like work and pay the taxes and
###331 help pay for the pensions, for example. And then in, largely in southern countries, for
###338 example, most of the largest potential growth we're going to see is in Africa and in Southern
###343 Asia, where the populations are getting younger. HARI SREENIVASAN: Ms. Karam, what does it
###348 mean when we have these sort of lopsided societies, when certain countries are going to have much
###353 older populations without the young to support them? AZZA KARAM: Well, it basically means
###359 what we're seeing evolve right now, which is migration patterns from the areas where
###364 there seems to be too many people, if one can say that, to areas where there is obviously
###368 a need for labor, because there is a serious shortage of that labor. That is only one of
###374 many implications, which is this migration trend. You are also going to see different
###380 kinds of pressures being exerted by governments, unfortunately, on women to either try to encourage
###387 them to have more children. But what is infinitely more effective, I think -- and that's one
###394 of the reasons why the United Nations Population Fund has been leading a 7 Billion Actions
###399 campaign globally -- what is a great deal more effective is to show how women can become
###405 very important agents of change in their societies. But in order to do so, they need access to
###410 good health care, access to education, equitable access to all kinds of resources. But we also
###416 know that investing in health care, especially maternal health and education about sexuality
###422 and reproductive health, can be -- can save lives and it can save a great deal of money.
###428 So it's very cost-effective to do this. HARI SREENIVASAN: Dennis, on your site, there's
###432 a story that says a baby born today in the U.S. or perhaps in a Western nation has a
###437 50/50 chance of living to be 100 years old. What sorts of resource strains -- or what
###443 sorts of resources do we have to have to sustain a population that can live that long? DENNIS
###447 DIMICK: Well, I think that's one point that we have tried to make in our series, also,
###451 is that this discussion of population is really not just about numbers of people, but it's
###456 also the resources that each of us use. And if you look in the United States, for example,
###462 we use many, many times much more resources per person than say a person in Bangladesh
###468 or other country that doesn't have advantage of, say, things like electricity. A quarter
###474 of the world's population doesn't even have electricity, like we take advantage of every
###479 day. HARI SREENIVASAN: Ms. Karam, what are those correlations that you're seeing between
###484 the levels of education for a woman and the population growth in those countries? AZZA
###489 KARAM: Well, we know for a fact that the statistics indicate that women who have more access to
###495 population and who are better educated are actually women who choose to have smaller
###501 families, certainly smaller compared to generations before them. So there is a very strong correlation
###507 between education and choosing or the ability to make choices about the size and the number
###515 of our families. But there's an even more important point I think that we have to make,
###519 which is that, effectively, there are over 200 million women who would want to have access
###527 to family planning facilities and care and who cannot have that access. And one of the
###532 things that the United Nations Population Fund and many partners around the world is
###538 engaging in is trying to ensure that there is an awareness that we have to make sure
###543 that not only knowledge and education, but also access and information about family planning
###550 and reproductive health care and access to services, all manner of reproductive health
###556 services, needs to be made available for women around the world and for families. HARI SREENIVASAN:
###561 All right. Azza Karam from the United Nations Population Fund and Dennis Dimick from National
###565 Geographic magazine, thanks so much for your time. DENNIS DIMICK: Thank you. AZZA KARAM:
