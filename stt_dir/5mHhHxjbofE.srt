0:0:3,487 --> 0:0:6,607
<i>Since I was a kid I've been able</i>
<i>to sleep through anything,</i>


2
0:0:6,607 --> 0:0:8,647
<i>Storms sirens you name it,</i>


3
0:0:8,647 --> 0:0:12,207
<i>Last night I didn't sleep,</i>


4
0:0:12,207 --> 0:0:17,127
<i>Couldn't stop thinking</i>
<i>about this past year,</i>


5
0:0:17,127 --> 0:0:20,767
Oh, please.
l've seen you naked before.


6
0:0:20,767 --> 0:0:26,7
Dude, you had that?
Five up high for cherry pie!


7
0:0:26,7 --> 0:0:28,647
You find it funny, Dr Dorian?
Why don't you tell me


8
0:0:28,647 --> 0:0:32,167
the EKG findings of Wolff-
Parkinson-White Syndrome?


9
0:0:32,167 --> 0:0:33,927
l haven't even showered yet.


10
0:0:33,927 --> 0:0:36,967
We could shower together
for old time's sake.


11
0:0:36,967 --> 0:0:40,127
l never would've slept with you
if l knew you were Dr Cox's ex.


12
0:0:40,127 --> 0:0:43,47
What was that, newbie?


13
0:0:43,47 --> 0:0:46,327
Relax. He doesn't know.


14
0:0:46,327 --> 0:0:48,407
He likes Carla anyway.


15
0:0:48,407 --> 0:0:50,727
l got Carla wrapped
around my finger.


16
0:0:50,727 --> 0:0:52,167
l heard that!


17
0:0:52,167 --> 0:0:54,687
- What are you guys talking about?
- Nothing.


18
0:0:54,687 --> 0:0:57,527
- Thank you.
- Forget about it.


19
0:0:57,527 --> 0:1:1,607
No, no, no.
You can't forget about these.


20
0:1:1,607 --> 0:1:5,87
l'd pull those hands back
if you wanna keep 'em, Q-tip.


21
0:1:5,87 --> 0:1:7,7
That's just the kind of thing


22
0:1:7,7 --> 0:1:10,127
that can be construed
as sexual harassment.


23
0:1:10,127 --> 0:1:13,767
Got a few hairs
in the sink, there, huh?


24
0:1:13,767 --> 0:1:17,527
For God's sake, man,
don't comb so hard.


25
0:1:17,527 --> 0:1:27,207
All right, enough is enough!


26
0:1:27,207 --> 0:1:30,647
l guess l don't fit in
with your mirror friends.


27
0:1:30,647 --> 0:1:36,927
Enjoy.


28
0:1:36,927 --> 0:1:39,687
<i>I don't know why my mind</i>
<i>is all over the place,</i>


29
0:1:39,687 --> 0:1:43,167
<i>Maybe it's because today</i>
<i>isn't just any other day,</i>


30
0:1:43,167 --> 0:1:45,967
<i>It's my last day as an intern,</i>


31
0:1:45,967 --> 0:1:48,207
Oh, you got me!


32
0:1:48,207 --> 0:1:50,207
Let me go, let me go!


33
0:1:50,207 --> 0:1:51,847
Hey, amigos!


34
0:1:51,847 --> 0:1:53,847
Can you guys believe this?


35
0:1:53,847 --> 0:1:56,87
Tomorrow,
we are officially residents.


36
0:1:56,87 --> 0:1:58,207
Let's get our last day on.


37
0:1:58,207 --> 0:2:3,447
<i>What the hell?</i>
<i>He deserves it too,</i>


38
0:2:3,447 --> 0:2:17,927
Mother...


39
0:2:17,927 --> 0:2:21,87
Mr Bober has been complaining
of abdominal pain and nausea.


40
0:2:21,87 --> 0:2:23,647
- Looks like cholecystitis.
- What, newbie?


41
0:2:23,647 --> 0:2:26,807
This gentleman is suffering
from an inflamed gallbladder


42
0:2:26,807 --> 0:2:29,687
and you have him eating
a grilled cheese sandwich.


43
0:2:29,687 --> 0:2:32,407
Here's an idea.
Why don't we just have him


44
0:2:32,407 --> 0:2:36,687
wash the whole thing down
with a big ol' mug of vodka?


45
0:2:36,687 --> 0:2:39,527
Mr Bober back there is
one of our frequent flyers.


46
0:2:39,527 --> 0:2:42,967
He's with us every six months
for years and l've grown fond of him.


47
0:2:42,967 --> 0:2:45,487
So if you could somehow
manage to not kill him,


48
0:2:45,487 --> 0:2:48,47
well, then, oh, gee,
that would just be ducky.


49
0:2:48,47 --> 0:2:51,207
How come you haven't mentioned
it's my last day as an intern?


50
0:2:51,207 --> 0:2:53,167
Haven't l?


51
0:2:53,167 --> 0:2:56,887
- Come here. Oh!
- OK. OK.


52
0:2:56,887 --> 0:2:59,967
Despite the fact that tomorrow
you will be a resident,


53
0:2:59,967 --> 0:3:2,687
you'll still be the excitable girl
that you are now.


54
0:3:2,687 --> 0:3:5,207
The only difference will be
that some new intern


55
0:3:5,207 --> 0:3:8,727
will mistake you for somebody
who actually knows something.


56
0:3:8,727 --> 0:3:10,327
<i>Why is he so uptight today?</i>


57
0:3:10,327 --> 0:3:12,567
- Hey, Perry.
- <i>Oh OK,</i>


58
0:3:12,567 --> 0:3:15,407
Jordan. To what
do we owe the horror?


59
0:3:15,407 --> 0:3:16,887
Come on, Perry.


60
0:3:16,887 --> 0:3:19,727
No soft spot for the one woman
who slept with you sober?


61
0:3:19,727 --> 0:3:22,407
Now, if you could sign
this insurance physical,


62
0:3:22,407 --> 0:3:25,807
l'll go back to trying to forget
that horrible, horrible night.


63
0:3:25,807 --> 0:3:28,607
For me to sign this, l would
have to give you a physical.


64
0:3:28,607 --> 0:3:30,87
And when l say ''l,''


65
0:3:30,87 --> 0:3:33,727
l, of course, mean
absolutely anybody but me.


66
0:3:33,727 --> 0:3:36,927
Barbie!
Give my ex-wife here a physical,


67
0:3:36,927 --> 0:3:40,207
and don't be afraid
of that third eye on her chest.


68
0:3:40,207 --> 0:3:47,887
Just remember, it's just as scared
of you as you are of it.


69
0:3:47,887 --> 0:3:51,567
Let's get physical?


70
0:3:51,567 --> 0:3:54,887
- Doesn't matter...
- Carla, can you do me a favour?


71
0:3:54,887 --> 0:3:58,127
Mr Bober needs yet another
Foley catheter. l am so swamped.


72
0:3:58,127 --> 0:4:0,847
Sure, no problem.
But we're not finished yet!


73
0:4:0,847 --> 0:4:2,447
l know we're not finished yet.


74
0:4:2,447 --> 0:4:6,47
l didn't say we were finished yet.
But, baby, it's up to you.


75
0:4:6,47 --> 0:4:7,647
<i>When a couple argues</i>


76
0:4:7,647 --> 0:4:9,807
<i>you should run</i>
<i>before you get roped in,</i>


77
0:4:9,807 --> 0:4:13,767
Hey, JD.


78
0:4:13,767 --> 0:4:15,767
- You got him, baby.
- l got him.


79
0:4:15,767 --> 0:4:18,7
- l got him!
- Bring him in.


80
0:4:18,7 --> 0:4:21,567
We were talking about our relationship
and how great everything is.


81
0:4:21,567 --> 0:4:24,407
l said, ''lt's weird to think
l'll never date again.''


82
0:4:24,407 --> 0:4:26,807
That's close,
but not quite what you said.


83
0:4:26,807 --> 0:4:30,367
What you said was, ''lt's weird
to think l'll never get to date again.''


84
0:4:30,367 --> 0:4:33,687
You see that? ''Get to date again'',
like she's missing out.


85
0:4:33,687 --> 0:4:36,327
- How messed up is that?
- l did not say ''get''.


86
0:4:36,327 --> 0:4:38,967
You're being ridiculous.
What do you think, JD?


87
0:4:38,967 --> 0:4:42,47
<i>Careful Tiger, Careful,</i>


88
0:4:42,47 --> 0:4:44,367
l wish people
would call me Tiger.


89
0:4:44,367 --> 0:4:45,647
What?


90
0:4:45,647 --> 0:4:55,847
l agree with Laverne.


91
0:4:55,847 --> 0:4:57,967
Damn kids and their stupid problems.


92
0:4:57,967 --> 0:5:5,447
l just wanna get home to a warm bath,
catch a little bit of that <i>Fear Factor,</i>


93
0:5:5,447 --> 0:5:9,727
Ted, the reason we're not admiring
the new parking structure


94
0:5:9,727 --> 0:5:15,687
is because you failed to get legal
clearance from the zoning board.


95
0:5:15,687 --> 0:5:25,767
Honestly, sometimes l wonder
if you're happy here.


96
0:5:25,767 --> 0:5:28,327
Do it, Ted. Just do it.


97
0:5:28,327 --> 0:5:30,367
Bob! When l heard
you were up on the roof


98
0:5:30,367 --> 0:5:33,87
l just assumed it was
because your evil mission


99
0:5:33,87 --> 0:5:36,327
here on planet Earth had finally
come to an end, so tell me this.


100
0:5:36,327 --> 0:5:38,447
Where exactly is the mother ship?


101
0:5:38,447 --> 0:5:40,607
- Look, Ted. lt's Dr Cox.
- Hey.


102
0:5:40,607 --> 0:5:44,207
l just saw the new shift schedule.
Give me a break, will you?


103
0:5:44,207 --> 0:5:47,607
l'm glad you're here. The hospital
needs a new Residency Director


104
0:5:47,607 --> 0:5:49,687
and l've decided to recommend you.


105
0:5:49,687 --> 0:5:52,167
Now, finish your tantrum
on your own,


106
0:5:52,167 --> 0:5:56,207
because l'm going to go down to
the cafeteria and get myself a fro-yo.


107
0:5:56,207 --> 0:5:59,727
Ted, chop-chop.


108
0:5:59,727 --> 0:6:2,87
Save my spot.


109
0:6:2,87 --> 0:6:5,487
Bambi, Mr Bober's hypotensive.
l think he's becoming septic.


110
0:6:5,487 --> 0:6:8,687
This guy is more work than
all my other patients combined.


111
0:6:8,687 --> 0:6:12,847
Maybe if you tell him how hard it is
on you, he'll get better!


112
0:6:12,847 --> 0:6:14,767
l'll get paper towels.


113
0:6:14,767 --> 0:6:17,247
Don't worry.
Somebody else will get it.


114
0:6:17,247 --> 0:6:19,7
Yeah. Who can we get?


115
0:6:19,7 --> 0:6:21,487
l'm not shocked.
That's how you live your life.


116
0:6:21,487 --> 0:6:24,47
Got a problem?
Hey, just pass it on down the line.


117
0:6:24,47 --> 0:6:25,487
<i>I was gonna say something</i>


118
0:6:25,487 --> 0:6:29,447
<i>but it turns out</i>
<i>he gave me a pretty good idea,</i>


119
0:6:29,447 --> 0:6:31,807
Thank you so much
for taking Bober from me.


120
0:6:31,807 --> 0:6:35,367
- But, JD, l...
- l owe you.


121
0:6:35,367 --> 0:6:38,527
<i>I'm a little doormat</i>
<i>I sit and stay</i>


122
0:6:38,527 --> 0:6:41,687
<i>Let people use me</i>
<i>every single day</i>


123
0:6:41,687 --> 0:6:43,167
Excuse me?


124
0:6:43,167 --> 0:6:47,327
Oh, it's a song l'm working on.
l made it up.


125
0:6:47,327 --> 0:6:50,367
So l let myself get taken
advantage of sometimes, you know?


126
0:6:50,367 --> 0:6:52,927
l mean, big deal.
How do you make friends?


127
0:6:52,927 --> 0:6:54,607
l've seen your type before.


128
0:6:54,607 --> 0:6:57,847
You're that girl that thought
she wanted to lose her virginity


129
0:6:57,847 --> 0:7:0,487
at a party while another guy
was asleep in the room.


130
0:7:0,487 --> 0:7:2,567
Chaz really cared for me.


131
0:7:2,567 --> 0:7:5,447
And l'm sure you have
a cool T-shirt to prove it.


132
0:7:5,447 --> 0:7:7,407
Can we please finish this physical?


133
0:7:7,407 --> 0:7:13,887
And l can't pee right now,
so you'll have to go for me.


134
0:7:13,887 --> 0:7:16,327
What a good girl. Good girl.


135
0:7:16,327 --> 0:7:20,367
<i>Still Elliot wasn't gonna let herself</i>
<i>get stuck with Mr Bober either,</i>


136
0:7:20,367 --> 0:7:23,247
- How you doing, Mr Bober?
- Fine.


137
0:7:23,247 --> 0:7:25,887
OK, why did you let
Elliot turf him up here?


138
0:7:25,887 --> 0:7:27,127
l don't know.


139
0:7:27,127 --> 0:7:30,927
All l really remember is she dropped
her pen and bent over.


140
0:7:30,927 --> 0:7:33,687
Dude, thong city!


141
0:7:33,687 --> 0:7:36,247
No. No high-five for you.


142
0:7:36,247 --> 0:7:39,327
- Todd did bad?
- Todd did very bad.


143
0:7:39,327 --> 0:7:41,727
Todd did very, very bad.


144
0:7:41,727 --> 0:7:43,207
What the hell, Elliot?


145
0:7:43,207 --> 0:7:45,567
You can't just pawn
this Bober guy off on me.


146
0:7:45,567 --> 0:7:48,967
lt was JD's patient! l was just
the middleman. Woman. Person.


147
0:7:48,967 --> 0:7:51,687
We can stand here
and argue about who screwed who.


148
0:7:51,687 --> 0:7:52,807
Or?


149
0:7:52,807 --> 0:7:54,767
Or nothing.
l'm on break. Let's do it.


150
0:7:54,767 --> 0:7:58,247
- Rock-paper-scissors right now.
- Fine. Loser gets Bober.


151
0:7:58,247 --> 0:8:0,407
Once, twice, three, shoot!


152
0:8:0,407 --> 0:8:2,207
Did you say Bober?


153
0:8:2,207 --> 0:8:4,887
l'm looking for my grandfather,
Frank Bober.


154
0:8:4,887 --> 0:8:10,207
We moved him to the lCU, dear.
He'll show you up.


155
0:8:10,207 --> 0:8:12,367
That's OK. She...
She didn't hear us.


156
0:8:12,367 --> 0:8:15,407
No, but Jesus did.


157
0:8:15,407 --> 0:8:22,687
<i>Just a closer walk with thee</i>


158
0:8:22,687 --> 0:8:25,247
l didn't appreciate
your game this morning.


159
0:8:25,247 --> 0:8:28,927
Heavens to Betsy,
the gazpacho is scrumptious today.


160
0:8:28,927 --> 0:8:31,447
Dangling that fake promotion
in front of me.


161
0:8:31,447 --> 0:8:34,847
l was dead serious about the
Residency Director's position.


162
0:8:34,847 --> 0:8:38,927
Well, what makes you think
that l'd be interested in that?


163
0:8:38,927 --> 0:8:40,327
Because you want my job,


164
0:8:40,327 --> 0:8:43,7
and you'll never get it
without this on your résumé.


165
0:8:43,7 --> 0:8:45,7
But you hate me.


166
0:8:45,7 --> 0:8:49,527
- Like nuts in brownies, captain.
- l don't get your angle.


167
0:8:49,527 --> 0:8:52,207
What could you want
in exchange for my support,


168
0:8:52,207 --> 0:8:55,807
because l'm telling you,
l am not dating that daughter of yours.


169
0:8:55,807 --> 0:8:58,7
l only have a son.


170
0:8:58,7 --> 0:9:1,567
That's my bad. l was just going
by that picture on your desk.


171
0:9:1,567 --> 0:9:4,7
You know the financial burdens
l deal with.


172
0:9:4,7 --> 0:9:7,407
l want you to stop busting my chops
all the time and get on my team.


173
0:9:7,407 --> 0:9:15,767
- Forget about it.
- Fine. Walk away.


174
0:9:15,767 --> 0:9:18,367
Scrumptious.


175
0:9:18,367 --> 0:9:20,767
Wanna bite?


176
0:9:20,767 --> 0:9:23,607
We're doctors.
That's how doctors talk to doctors.


177
0:9:23,607 --> 0:9:26,887
Our only mistake was not being careful
about where we were.


178
0:9:26,887 --> 0:9:28,567
We agree we did nothing wrong,


179
0:9:28,567 --> 0:9:31,87
so let's check in on him
and forget about it.


180
0:9:31,87 --> 0:9:33,487
<i>And that's when</i>
<i>the three of us realized</i>


181
0:9:33,487 --> 0:9:36,407
<i>even though we'd all</i>
<i>spent time with Mr Bober</i>


182
0:9:36,407 --> 0:9:39,407
<i>none of us had any idea</i>
<i>what he looked like,</i>


183
0:9:39,407 --> 0:9:43,7
Over here.


184
0:9:43,7 --> 0:9:50,167
Hey, guys.


185
0:9:50,167 --> 0:9:52,87
<i>When we started here a year ago</i>


186
0:9:52,87 --> 0:9:55,47
<i>and saw some of the</i>
<i>insensitive and jaded doctors</i>


187
0:9:55,47 --> 0:9:56,927
<i>we all said the same thing:</i>


188
0:9:56,927 --> 0:9:59,7
<i>''That's not gonna be me, ''</i>


189
0:9:59,7 --> 0:10:0,767
<i>Really the only solace</i>


190
0:10:0,767 --> 0:10:20,127
<i>is that the guilt</i>
<i>passes pretty quickly,</i>


191
0:10:20,127 --> 0:10:22,167
What's wrong, dog?


192
0:10:22,167 --> 0:10:24,407
You guys,
we have to do something.


193
0:10:24,407 --> 0:10:28,647
lf we remove Mr Bober's gallbladder,
it should relieve the abdominal pain.


194
0:10:28,647 --> 0:10:30,847
lsn't he a little old
for that procedure?


195
0:10:30,847 --> 0:10:36,607
- Well, he seems stable enough.
- Problem is, he has no insurance.


196
0:10:36,607 --> 0:10:43,127
<i>And then all at once</i>
<i>we realized we had to do something,</i>


197
0:10:43,127 --> 0:10:47,7
<i>We decided to attack</i>
<i>the problem on three fronts,</i>


198
0:10:47,7 --> 0:10:52,367
Dr Cox?


199
0:10:52,367 --> 0:10:59,7
Ms Sullivan?


200
0:10:59,7 --> 0:11:1,287
Dr Wen?


201
0:11:1,287 --> 0:11:4,287
l thought if you looked
at Mr Bober's chart and agreed,


202
0:11:4,287 --> 0:11:6,927
you might be able
to pull some strings or...


203
0:11:6,927 --> 0:11:9,767
<i>And now here it comes:</i>
<i>The calling me a girl's name</i>


204
0:11:9,767 --> 0:11:12,7
<i>the telling me</i>
<i>not to waste my time,,,</i>


205
0:11:12,7 --> 0:11:15,407
Yep. l'll be more than glad
to help you there, Charlotte.


206
0:11:15,407 --> 0:11:17,167
<i>I was half right,</i>


207
0:11:17,167 --> 0:11:19,7
Well, thank you.


208
0:11:19,7 --> 0:11:22,167
Don't ever be afraid
to come to me with stuff like that.


209
0:11:22,167 --> 0:11:24,687
The simple fact
that you seem to give a crap


210
0:11:24,687 --> 0:11:27,567
is the reason l took an interest
in you to begin with.


211
0:11:27,567 --> 0:11:31,607
lt's why l trust you as a doctor.
Hell, it's...


212
0:11:31,607 --> 0:11:37,167
lt's why l trust you as a person.


213
0:11:37,167 --> 0:11:39,447
Are you dying?


214
0:11:39,447 --> 0:11:44,87
l've got a new shrink.


215
0:11:44,87 --> 0:11:46,7
<i>Ah just say it,</i>


216
0:11:46,7 --> 0:11:48,767
You know, l want to thank you
for this whole year.


217
0:11:48,767 --> 0:11:50,447
Oh, no.


218
0:11:50,447 --> 0:11:53,927
And l just want to know
if l can buy you dinner.


219
0:11:53,927 --> 0:11:55,287
That'd be terrific.


220
0:11:55,287 --> 0:11:58,367
- Great! l'm off in a half hour...
- Oh, no!


221
0:11:58,367 --> 0:12:1,167
Here l was led
to believe that you were...


222
0:12:1,167 --> 0:12:3,567
...doing a gift certificate
kind of thing.


223
0:12:3,567 --> 0:12:7,7
But to sit and eat with you? That's...


224
0:12:7,7 --> 0:12:10,167
That's just... That's crazy talk.


225
0:12:10,167 --> 0:12:13,87
l have half a mind
to issue you a drug test.


226
0:12:13,87 --> 0:12:17,127
- Come on! What'd l sign up for...
- Would've been nice.


227
0:12:17,127 --> 0:12:21,287
He doesn't have insurance. lf you could
talk to the board, JD thought maybe...


228
0:12:21,287 --> 0:12:23,767
First he dumps that patient on you,


229
0:12:23,767 --> 0:12:25,847
and now he wants you
to ask me a favour?


230
0:12:25,847 --> 0:12:27,687
lf you don't start saying no,


231
0:12:27,687 --> 0:12:29,847
you're gonna wind up
on the playing a game


232
0:12:29,847 --> 0:12:32,847
- l call Hide The Pickle.
- JD and l are just colleagues.


233
0:12:32,847 --> 0:12:37,167
l was joking, but you actually
slept with him, didn't you?


234
0:12:37,167 --> 0:12:38,247
A little.


235
0:12:38,247 --> 0:12:42,207
l don't know where your mother was when
she should've told you these things,


236
0:12:42,207 --> 0:12:45,47
but you cannot have sex
with someone you care about.


237
0:12:45,47 --> 0:12:47,807
Sex is for making babies and revenge.


238
0:12:47,807 --> 0:12:51,807
Oh, you're so full of it.


239
0:12:51,807 --> 0:12:54,607
Listen, stick,
if you wanna wipe your nose


240
0:12:54,607 --> 0:12:57,367
and pretend that was a sneeze,
l will play along.


241
0:12:57,367 --> 0:13:2,87
But if you have something to say,
say it.


242
0:13:2,87 --> 0:13:4,567
Everybody knows
you're sleeping with Dr Cox,


243
0:13:4,567 --> 0:13:8,7
and it can't be about making babies,
cos you'd end up eating them.


244
0:13:8,7 --> 0:13:10,607
As for revenge, l'm not sure
that pleasuring him


245
0:13:10,607 --> 0:13:13,767
while he watches <i>SportsCenter</i>
hurts him as much as you think.


246
0:13:13,767 --> 0:13:16,447
You still care about him
whether you admit it or not.


247
0:13:16,447 --> 0:13:27,7
And if you lay one finger on me,
l'm blowing my rape whistle.


248
0:13:27,7 --> 0:13:32,527
Kiss her?


249
0:13:32,527 --> 0:13:34,887
So you see, Dr Wen,
it's not really a favour.


250
0:13:34,887 --> 0:13:39,367
We were supposed to do surgery
on Mrs Beckerman, but she passed away.


251
0:13:39,367 --> 0:13:41,207
Go on.


252
0:13:41,207 --> 0:13:45,7
She's dead, and we hoped that you
could keep her name on the roster.


253
0:13:45,7 --> 0:13:46,887
We don't wanna do surgery on her.


254
0:13:46,887 --> 0:13:50,87
Let's face it, Dr Wen.
We're good, but we're not that good.


255
0:13:50,87 --> 0:13:52,807
- You know what l'm saying?
- No.


256
0:13:52,807 --> 0:13:55,447
We want to get a patient
approved for surgery.


257
0:13:55,447 --> 0:13:57,407
We hope you can keep the slot open.


258
0:13:57,407 --> 0:13:58,647
Oh, sure.


259
0:13:58,647 --> 0:14:1,87
Dr Turk, next time
you need to talk to me,


260
0:14:1,87 --> 0:14:4,207
think hard about what you want to say,
then send her.


261
0:14:4,207 --> 0:14:7,887
- Of course. Thanks, Dr Wen.
- See, what happened there was,


262
0:14:7,887 --> 0:14:11,967
l knew what you were trying to say
despite the exact words you were using.


263
0:14:11,967 --> 0:14:15,367
l tried to help you out instead
of getting mad at you over nothing.


264
0:14:15,367 --> 0:14:18,47
Baby, we both know
it's not the same.


265
0:14:18,47 --> 0:14:23,527
You are the dumbest man
l ever laid eyes on.


266
0:14:23,527 --> 0:14:27,487
Still.


267
0:14:27,487 --> 0:14:30,407
Didn't hurt! Didn't hurt!


268
0:14:30,407 --> 0:14:32,487
Tell me if it hurts this time!


269
0:14:32,487 --> 0:14:36,647
So, you want me to approve
surgery on a 76-year-old man


270
0:14:36,647 --> 0:14:39,527
with no insurance
and no life-threatening condition?


271
0:14:39,527 --> 0:14:41,527
Young man, l'm curious.


272
0:14:41,527 --> 0:14:45,287
What did you think the end result
of this conversation would be?


273
0:14:45,287 --> 0:14:46,847
Well, pretty much, this.


274
0:14:46,847 --> 0:14:49,767
Except l'm invested,
so l thought l might try crying.


275
0:14:49,767 --> 0:14:51,527
Sport, if crying worked on me,


276
0:14:51,527 --> 0:14:58,87
my wife would have
her own car by now.


277
0:14:58,87 --> 0:15:3,487
- Bob? l think you should reconsider.
- What's that, Perry?


278
0:15:3,487 --> 0:15:7,407
l mean, because that didn't sound
like something a teammate would say.


279
0:15:7,407 --> 0:15:11,247
Maybe you meant to pat me on
the ass and say, ''Go get 'em, Bob.''


280
0:15:11,247 --> 0:15:13,967
Right, but what if
we were to look at this


281
0:15:13,967 --> 0:15:16,847
from a purely fiscal perspective?


282
0:15:16,847 --> 0:15:18,887
<i>Did he just say ''fiscal''?</i>


283
0:15:18,887 --> 0:15:21,967
After all, Mr Bober
is here every four to six months,


284
0:15:21,967 --> 0:15:24,167
and if we were
to consider his surgery


285
0:15:24,167 --> 0:15:27,167
as a one-time expenditure, then...


286
0:15:27,167 --> 0:15:30,247
...you would be making
the right financial call.


287
0:15:30,247 --> 0:15:35,367
See now? That's the kind of thinking
l can get behind!


288
0:15:35,367 --> 0:15:37,327
How'd that make you feel?


289
0:15:37,327 --> 0:15:40,487
- Dirty all over.
- You get used to it.


290
0:15:40,487 --> 0:15:43,487
Boys, l'll do what l can,
but if you're gonna pull this off,


291
0:15:43,487 --> 0:15:45,927
you're gonna need
a board member behind you.


292
0:15:45,927 --> 0:15:48,807
<i>How the hell</i>
<i>are we supposed to get that?</i>


293
0:15:48,807 --> 0:15:51,487
This is the closest l've come


294
0:15:51,487 --> 0:15:54,447
to not hating myself
after sleeping with you.


295
0:15:54,447 --> 0:15:56,407
Oh, you're just saying that.


296
0:15:56,407 --> 0:16:2,167
Actually, l'm not. l...
We connected.


297
0:16:2,167 --> 0:16:5,687
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing.


298
0:16:5,687 --> 0:16:9,607
l guess l was just thinking
of a guy l kind of like.


299
0:16:9,607 --> 0:16:11,127
Let me guess.


300
0:16:11,127 --> 0:16:17,127
He is an arrogant, self-hating
narcissist who just needs to be loved.


301
0:16:17,127 --> 0:16:22,287
- Yeah, pretty much.
- Nobody better.


302
0:16:22,287 --> 0:16:24,247
Hey, stud?


303
0:16:24,247 --> 0:16:27,87
Thank you for not asking me
to help on the Bober thing.


304
0:16:27,87 --> 0:16:29,767
l would've,
but it would've been pointless.


305
0:16:29,767 --> 0:16:32,807
Turns out, you're a very
predictable woman there.


306
0:16:32,807 --> 0:16:35,687
- Please.
- l know you.


307
0:16:35,687 --> 0:16:39,567
You're gonna walk into that boardroom
tonight all tall and strong,


308
0:16:39,567 --> 0:16:44,527
and then you're gonna sit back and just
pray that nobody asks your opinion.


309
0:16:44,527 --> 0:16:46,607
l mean, l'm sure
you probably think


310
0:16:46,607 --> 0:16:49,647
that your little visits here
are a spontaneous surprise,


311
0:16:49,647 --> 0:16:52,647
but did you ever wonder
why the only two candles l own


312
0:16:52,647 --> 0:16:54,847
are already lit
when you walk in that door?


313
0:16:54,847 --> 0:16:57,887
l mean, doll, l hate to tell you this,
but l don't walk around


314
0:16:57,887 --> 0:17:0,567
all day with cologne
down in my engine room.


315
0:17:0,567 --> 0:17:3,327
l'm not that guy.


316
0:17:3,327 --> 0:17:5,607
Some people like reliability.


317
0:17:5,607 --> 0:17:8,847
ln a sedan, it turns out it's terrific.


318
0:17:8,847 --> 0:17:14,327
Cheers.
Here's the good news, however.


319
0:17:14,327 --> 0:17:18,7
Turns out it's never too late
to turn the whole thing around.


320
0:17:18,7 --> 0:17:19,727
Really?


321
0:17:19,727 --> 0:17:22,567
All you gotta do
is stir it up a little bit.


322
0:17:22,567 --> 0:17:25,167
- Stir it up?
- Stir it right the hell up.


323
0:17:25,167 --> 0:17:29,287
- l'll try to remember that.
- So l'm guessing


324
0:17:29,287 --> 0:17:34,207
l'll be seeing you
in about 1 1 days, right?


325
0:17:34,207 --> 0:17:38,47
Probably at the exact same time.


326
0:17:38,47 --> 0:17:44,527
Don't forget to stir it up, baby.


327
0:17:44,527 --> 0:17:46,967
<i>And so it comes down to this</i>


328
0:17:46,967 --> 0:17:50,727
<i>the hospital board meeting</i>
<i>to decide Mr Bober's fate,</i>


329
0:17:50,727 --> 0:18:21,847
<i>And in a weird way ours too,</i>


330
0:18:21,847 --> 0:18:23,607
<i>As cheesy as it sounds</i>


331
0:18:23,607 --> 0:18:26,47
<i>I think we knew</i>
<i>we were all gonna be OK,</i>


332
0:18:26,47 --> 0:18:28,487
Hi, Mr Bober.


333
0:18:28,487 --> 0:18:31,847
<i>Still I've had this feeling</i>
<i>that I'm forgetting something,</i>


334
0:18:31,847 --> 0:18:33,327
Hey!


335
0:18:33,327 --> 0:18:35,687
Congratulations
on becoming a resident.


336
0:18:35,687 --> 0:18:37,167
Glad l could help.


337
0:18:37,167 --> 0:18:40,687
Help? You were awful to me.


338
0:18:40,687 --> 0:18:42,727
You... awful.


339
0:18:42,727 --> 0:18:46,887
Anyway, go get 'em, tiger.


340
0:18:46,887 --> 0:18:51,647
The world is your oyster, my friend.
What?


341
0:18:51,647 --> 0:18:55,7
lt's my first day.
l'm waiting for someone.


342
0:18:55,7 --> 0:18:56,927
This door is broke.


343
0:18:56,927 --> 0:18:59,367
Every fifth time or so,
it don't open.


344
0:18:59,367 --> 0:19:4,287
Maybe there's a paper clip
stuck in there.


345
0:19:4,287 --> 0:19:7,967
- Why a paper clip?
- l was just making small talk.


346
0:19:7,967 --> 0:19:11,567
- Did you put a paper clip in there?
- No.


347
0:19:11,567 --> 0:19:14,687
lf l find a paper clip...


348
0:19:14,687 --> 0:19:17,327
...you're goin' down.


349
0:19:17,327 --> 0:19:20,567
- Here's to the new residents!
- Here, here!


350
0:19:20,567 --> 0:19:22,967
- l'm a doctor!
- <i>It's been a long year</i>


351
0:19:22,967 --> 0:19:25,887
<i>but the important thing is</i>
<i>we got through it together,</i>


352
0:19:25,887 --> 0:19:28,887
- <i>We were a family,</i>
- Hey, everyone.


353
0:19:28,887 --> 0:19:31,207
- Oh, hi.
- How are you?


354
0:19:31,207 --> 0:19:34,207
Ms Sullivan, thank you
for helping us with Mr Bober.


355
0:19:34,207 --> 0:19:37,847
Don't mention it. Even though
l wasn't invited to your party,


356
0:19:37,847 --> 0:19:41,87
- l brought presents for everyone.
- Brace yourself, newbie.


357
0:19:41,87 --> 0:19:43,847
Carla, my ex-husband
is in love with you.


358
0:19:43,847 --> 0:19:46,887
lt's true.
Ask your boyfriend. He knows.

0:19:46,887 --> 0:19:48,927
He and Perry
talk about it all the time.


360
0:19:48,927 --> 0:19:51,607
l don't know why you haven't
mentioned this to her.


361
0:19:51,607 --> 0:19:54,447
Perhaps you're afraid
of something. Huh.


362
0:19:54,447 --> 0:19:57,527
And, Bob, when are you gonna
tell Perry that that promotion


363
0:19:57,527 --> 0:20:1,967
you're making him jump through
hoops for was filled months ago?


364
0:20:1,967 --> 0:20:5,447
lt just seems wrong.
Which brings us to Twinkie.


365
0:20:5,447 --> 0:20:9,7
lf you don't have the courage
to tell your ''colleague'' Dr Dorian


366
0:20:9,7 --> 0:20:11,87
that you're still crazy about him,


367
0:20:11,87 --> 0:20:14,687
l'm gonna do it for you,
cos that's what friends do. Yeah.


368
0:20:14,687 --> 0:20:17,927
And finally, Perry,


369
0:20:17,927 --> 0:20:20,127
you are not gonna
believe what happened


370
0:20:20,127 --> 0:20:22,847
the first time l met
your little protégé here.


371
0:20:22,847 --> 0:20:25,447
<i>Oh please God no,</i>


372
0:20:25,447 --> 0:20:29,647
l slept with him,
and it was good.


373
0:20:29,647 --> 0:20:32,287
How's that for stirring things up?


374
0:20:32,287 --> 0:21:15,647
Have a great summer, everyone. Bye.


375
0:21:15,647 --> 0:23:15,647
