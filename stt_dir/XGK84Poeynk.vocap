###10 We are all connected;
###13 To each other, biologically
###15 To the earth, chemically
###18 To the rest of the universe atomically
###20 I think nature's imagination
###23 Is so much greater than man's
###26 She's never going to let us relax
###31 We live in an in-between universe
###33 Where things change all right
###35 But according to patterns, rules,
###38 Or as we call them, laws of nature
###40 I'm this guy standing on a planet
###44 Really I'm just a speck
###47 Compared with a star, the planet is just another speck
###51 To think about all of this
###54 To think about the vast emptiness of space
###56 There's billions and billions of stars
###59 Billions and billions of specks
###61 The beauty of a living thing is not the atoms that go into it
###67 But the way those atoms are put together
###72 The cosmos is also within us
###74 We're made of star stuff
###77 We are a way for the cosmos to know itself
###82 Across the sea of space
###84 The stars are other suns
###87 We have traveled this way before
###90 And there is much to be learned
###92 We are all connected;
###94 To each other, biologically
###97 To the earth, chemically
###100 To the rest of the universe atomically
###102 I find it elevating and exhilarating
###104 To discover that we live in a universe
###107 Which permits the evolution of molecular machines
###110 As intricate and subtle as we
###122 I know that the molecules in my body are traceable
###126 To phenomena in the cosmos
###128 That makes me want to grab people in the street
###131 And say, have you heard this??
###133 The beauty of a living thing is not the atoms that go into it
###138 But the way those atoms are put together
###143 The cosmos is also within us
###145 We're made of star stuff
###148 We are a way for the cosmos to know itself
###164 There's this tremendous mess
###166 Of waves all over in space
###169 Which is the light bouncing around the room
###171 And going from one thing to the other
###174 And it's all really there
###179 But you gotta stop and think about it
###181 About the complexity to really get the pleasure
###184 And it's all really there
###190 The inconceivable nature of nature
###194 To think about all of this
###197 To think about the vast emptiness of space
###199 There's billions and billions of stars
###202 Billions and billions of specks
###204 The beauty of a living thing is not the atoms that go into it
###209 But the way those atoms are put together
###215 The cosmos is also within us
###217 We're made of star stuff
###220 We are a way for the cosmos to know itself
###225 Across the sea of space
###227 The stars are other suns
###229 We have traveled this way before
###233 And there is much to be learned
