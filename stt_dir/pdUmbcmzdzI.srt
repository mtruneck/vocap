1
0:0:1,4 --> 0:0:3,135
TRAVIS:
Now on "Rocket City Rednecks"...


2
0:0:3,135 --> 0:0:5,404
We answer the call
to build a new kind of drone


3
0:0:5,404 --> 0:0:7,73
for the U.S. military.


4
0:0:7,73 --> 0:0:8,874
Don't try. Do it.


5
0:0:8,874 --> 0:0:11,377
But when a military expert
comes to check it out...


6
0:0:11,377 --> 0:0:13,846
MAN: Rockets and guns, huh?
TRAVIS: Rockets and guns.


7
0:0:13,846 --> 0:0:16,115
Will it be
"Sweet Drone Alabama"?


8
0:0:16,115 --> 0:0:17,483
Oh!


9
0:0:17,483 --> 0:0:20,786
Or will our weaponized aircraft
fail to make the grade?


10
0:0:20,786 --> 0:0:24,657
Oh, no! Oh, no! Crap!


11
0:0:24,657 --> 0:0:26,258
I'm Travis Taylor.


12
0:0:26,258 --> 0:0:28,427
I'm a rocket scientist in
the space and defense industry


13
0:0:28,427 --> 0:0:31,464
here in my hometown
of Huntsville, Alabama,


14
0:0:31,464 --> 0:0:32,932
where my daddy
helped build the rockets


15
0:0:32,932 --> 0:0:34,533
that sent us to the moon.


16
0:0:34,533 --> 0:0:37,303
DADDY: Have y'all been drinking
rocket fuel again?


17
0:0:37,303 --> 0:0:40,39
TRAVIS: Sometimes big science
moves too slow for me, 


18
0:0:40,39 --> 0:0:44,243
so come the weekend,
I round up my best friend Rog,


19
0:0:44,243 --> 0:0:46,445
my nephew Michael,
and my buddy Pete


20
0:0:46,445 --> 0:0:48,147
to tackle important problems


21
0:0:48,147 --> 0:0:50,382
with a little
down-home ingenuity.


22
0:0:50,382 --> 0:0:55,254
ROG: Damn it, boy!


23
0:0:55,254 --> 0:0:56,755
TRAVIS: Right on.


24
0:0:56,755 --> 0:0:59,925
Hey, is there any more beers
in the cooler?


25
0:0:59,925 --> 0:1:1,427
TRAVIS: The U.S. military's


26
0:1:1,427 --> 0:1:3,596
been taking out
all kinds of enemy targets


27
0:1:3,596 --> 0:1:5,431
with the help of combat drones.


28
0:1:5,431 --> 0:1:7,6
And this weekend,
we're going to join them


29
0:1:7,6 --> 0:1:10,703
in creating the next generation
of drone technology--


30
0:1:10,703 --> 0:1:13,272
ones that don't cost
millions of dollars to make.


31
0:1:13,272 --> 0:1:15,141
I told all the guys
to bring anything


32
0:1:15,141 --> 0:1:17,343
that looks like
it's a remote control vehicle,


33
0:1:17,343 --> 0:1:19,612
electronic airplanes,
helicopters, whatever,


34
0:1:19,612 --> 0:1:21,313
lightweight
construction material.


35
0:1:21,313 --> 0:1:22,481
PETE: We don't need this.


36
0:1:22,481 --> 0:1:25,151
ROG: Why we dragging
all this crap out for?


37
0:1:25,151 --> 0:1:29,655
TRAVIS: What we're gonna do is
we're gonna build a UAV drone.


38
0:1:29,655 --> 0:1:31,891
The American military
is looking to make


39
0:1:31,891 --> 0:1:35,561
a small unmanned
aerial vehicle, or UAV,


40
0:1:35,561 --> 0:1:38,631
that can be carried by a single
soldier out in the field.


41
0:1:38,631 --> 0:1:42,34
In fact, the Defense Advanced
Research Projects Agency,


42
0:1:42,34 --> 0:1:43,235
or DARPA,


43
0:1:43,235 --> 0:1:45,171
has issued a challenge
to citizen scientists


44
0:1:45,171 --> 0:1:47,439
to build a drone
that can do three things.


45
0:1:47,439 --> 0:1:49,542
One, fly a couple miles.


46
0:1:49,542 --> 0:1:51,443
Two, send back video.


47
0:1:51,443 --> 0:1:53,679
And three, fit into a backpack


48
0:1:53,679 --> 0:1:56,749
so a single soldier
can carry it.


49
0:1:56,749 --> 0:1:59,185
Let's say this soldier
gets into trouble,


50
0:1:59,185 --> 0:2:0,92
so he pulls his UAV
out of his backpack,


51
0:2:0,92 --> 0:2:2,721
tosses it up,
it flies up over the trees


52
0:2:2,721 --> 0:2:4,456
and looks and finds
where the bad guys are.


53
0:2:4,456 --> 0:2:7,426
They give him either an escape
route or an attack route.


54
0:2:7,426 --> 0:2:9,94
MICHAEL:
My dad's in the military.


55
0:2:9,94 --> 0:2:11,263
I'd love for him to have
something like this.


56
0:2:11,263 --> 0:2:12,798
So this is
a real important build to me,


57
0:2:12,798 --> 0:2:15,367
and I think I can
contribute a lot to it.


58
0:2:15,367 --> 0:2:16,635
TRAVIS:
People are used to drones


59
0:2:16,635 --> 0:2:18,637
that look and fly
like airplanes,


60
0:2:18,637 --> 0:2:20,773
but I want ours
to take off vertically,


61
0:2:20,773 --> 0:2:24,21
so we're gonna make
a helicopter drone.


62
0:2:24,21 --> 0:2:27,947
We're gonna use remote-control
helicopter motors for lift,


63
0:2:27,947 --> 0:2:30,716
and below them
we'll mount a video camera.


64
0:2:30,716 --> 0:2:32,51
And even though DARPA


65
0:2:32,51 --> 0:2:34,553
isn't calling for their
portable drones to have weapons,


66
0:2:34,553 --> 0:2:37,22
we're gonna add
rockets and a gun


67
0:2:37,22 --> 0:2:40,159
that can be fired remotely.


68
0:2:40,159 --> 0:2:41,86
For our first test,


69
0:2:41,86 --> 0:2:44,763
we've already got a gun
hooked up to a couple motors


70
0:2:44,763 --> 0:2:46,932
from a remote control
helicopter.


71
0:2:46,932 --> 0:2:49,235
We're gonna see if it can
get off the ground


72
0:2:49,235 --> 0:2:50,436
and if we can
fire off of some rounds


73
0:2:50,436 --> 0:2:52,71
using this really cool
firing system


74
0:2:52,71 --> 0:2:55,7
that Michael designed.


75
0:2:55,7 --> 0:2:58,177
When we push a joystick
on the RC controller,


76
0:2:58,177 --> 0:3:1,914
a small motor, also known
as a servo, will rotate,


77
0:3:1,914 --> 0:3:3,816
driving an armature
into the trigger


78
0:3:3,816 --> 0:3:5,184
like a plastic finger...


79
0:3:5,184 --> 0:3:6,452
and bang!


80
0:3:6,452 --> 0:3:9,388
The enemy
won't know what hit 'em.


81
0:3:9,388 --> 0:3:11,624
We're about to take it
out in the backyard


82
0:3:11,624 --> 0:3:14,193
and see if we can fly this thing
with two motors


83
0:3:14,193 --> 0:3:17,129
and fire
this paintball gun with it.


84
0:3:17,129 --> 0:3:18,564
ROG: How cool is that?


85
0:3:18,564 --> 0:3:21,667
We just made ourselves
a flying gun.


86
0:3:21,667 --> 0:3:24,77
I bet we can take that thing
duck hunting.


87
0:3:24,77 --> 0:3:26,772
PETE: We loaded it up
with plenty of ammo,


88
0:3:26,772 --> 0:3:30,809
and Mr. Taylor made us
a nice target to shoot at.


89
0:3:30,809 --> 0:3:34,213
TRAVIS: Here we go,
We're gonna bring the motors up.


90
0:3:34,213 --> 0:3:35,848
We're coming on up.


91
0:3:35,848 --> 0:3:37,583
Yeah, there we go.
Are we getting any lift?


92
0:3:37,583 --> 0:3:38,817
You feel like it's
pulling out of your hand?


93
0:3:38,817 --> 0:3:40,586
MICHAEL: It's pulling.
Just not enough.


94
0:3:40,586 --> 0:3:43,88
TRAVIS: Careful with it now.
All the way, all the way.


95
0:3:43,88 --> 0:3:44,556
Going full throttle.


96
0:3:44,556 --> 0:3:46,625
MICHAEL: Full throttle it.
ROG: Stay with it.


97
0:3:46,625 --> 0:3:48,6
Michael: Is that wide open?


98
0:3:48,6 --> 0:3:50,429
TRAVIS: It's wide open.
It ain't gonna lift it. Crap!


99
0:3:50,429 --> 0:3:52,665
Yeah, I thought it
would have lifted it, man.


100
0:3:52,665 --> 0:3:53,999
PETE: Maybe those batteries--


101
0:3:53,999 --> 0:3:55,367
TRAVIS: That gun's
just a lot heavier,


102
0:3:55,367 --> 0:3:56,669
and the paintballs
added more weight.


103
0:3:56,669 --> 0:3:58,3
That's a lot of weight


104
0:3:58,3 --> 0:3:59,772
'cause that's all liquid
in them paintballs.


105
0:3:59,772 --> 0:4:1,307
PETE: It's obvious
we're gonna need more motors


106
0:4:1,307 --> 0:4:3,709
to lift all the payload
on our weaponized drone.


107
0:4:3,709 --> 0:4:5,644
But before
we work on that problem,


108
0:4:5,644 --> 0:4:7,98
we're gonna go ahead and see if
our remote trigger works.


109
0:4:7,98 --> 0:4:9,815
MICHAEL: Gun's hot.
TRAVIS: Alright, here we go.


110
0:4:9,815 --> 0:4:13,786
Gun's hot, ready to fire it
in three, two, one.


111
0:4:13,786 --> 0:4:15,521
MICHAEL: When they hit
that remote trigger


112
0:4:15,521 --> 0:4:17,189
on the controller,


113
0:4:17,189 --> 0:4:22,127
that plastic finger should
rotate and fire the gun.


114
0:4:22,127 --> 0:4:24,763
TRAVIS: Crap!


115
0:4:24,763 --> 0:4:26,332
DADDY: Now, I like to see
things go off


116
0:4:26,332 --> 0:4:27,733
when you pull the trigger.


117
0:4:27,733 --> 0:4:29,101
MICHAEL: You ain't got nothing.
TRAVIS: Crap.


118
0:4:29,101 --> 0:4:30,636
DADDY: I'm just frustrated.


119
0:4:30,636 --> 0:4:33,238
The motors didn't work,
and neither did the trigger.


120
0:4:33,238 --> 0:4:35,908
We got our work
cut out for us on this one.


121
0:4:35,908 --> 0:4:38,744
TRAVIS: One complete motor...


122
0:4:38,744 --> 0:4:40,612
One of the things
we learned from this test


123
0:4:40,612 --> 0:4:44,249
is we need to know exactly how
much weight each motor can lift,


124
0:4:44,249 --> 0:4:47,286
because we want our drone
to carry not just a gun,


125
0:4:47,286 --> 0:4:49,788
but a camera
and a whole bunch of rockets.


126
0:4:49,788 --> 0:4:51,156
MICHAEL: What you think
about that?


127
0:4:51,156 --> 0:4:52,257
DADDY: Hey, that's neat.


128
0:4:52,257 --> 0:4:53,459
MICHAEL: We didn't know
how to measure


129
0:4:53,459 --> 0:4:55,227
how much weight
the motor could lift,


130
0:4:55,227 --> 0:4:57,329
but then Papaw had an idea.


131
0:4:57,329 --> 0:5:1,867
DADDY: Why not just use
my old fish scales?


132
0:5:1,867 --> 0:5:6,238
TRAVIS: Everybody get
your safety glasses on.


133
0:5:6,238 --> 0:5:8,374
All right, so what
we're gonna do with this


134
0:5:8,374 --> 0:5:12,311
is measure the lift
of this engine, all right,


135
0:5:12,311 --> 0:5:14,79
by looking at the scale
right there


136
0:5:14,79 --> 0:5:15,714
and see how much thrust
we're getting out of it.


137
0:5:15,714 --> 0:5:18,283
Y'all be careful
because the blades are sharp.


138
0:5:18,283 --> 0:5:20,319
They'll cut your finger off
in a heartbeat.


139
0:5:20,319 --> 0:5:24,123
All right, here we go.


140
0:5:24,123 --> 0:5:28,66
[motor revs]


141
0:5:28,66 --> 0:5:31,296
TRAVIS:
That's good. That's good.


142
0:5:31,296 --> 0:5:35,3
How much was that?
MICHAEL: Five pounds.


143
0:5:35,3 --> 0:5:38,203
TRAVIS: So if one motor
can lift five pounds,


144
0:5:38,203 --> 0:5:39,772
then four can lift twenty.


145
0:5:39,772 --> 0:5:42,674
That ought to be enough,
so that's the plan.


146
0:5:42,674 --> 0:5:44,643
We're gonna build
a four-propeller


147
0:5:44,643 --> 0:5:46,278
helicopter drone.


148
0:5:46,278 --> 0:5:48,881
We're gonna put our propellers
on a frame,


149
0:5:48,881 --> 0:5:52,317
and we'll hang the camera
and the weapons from that.


150
0:5:52,317 --> 0:5:54,853
I want to get this thing
done today


151
0:5:54,853 --> 0:5:56,188
or first thing in the morning


152
0:5:56,188 --> 0:5:58,824
'cause a buddy of mine
that's a UAV expert


153
0:5:58,824 --> 0:6:0,793
over at University of Alabama
in Huntsville


154
0:6:0,793 --> 0:6:3,262
told me he'd come over here
tomorrow about 2:00


155
0:6:3,262 --> 0:6:7,32
to see our solution.


156
0:6:7,32 --> 0:6:9,535
Dr. Brian Landrum
has been working with the army


157
0:6:9,535 --> 0:6:11,103
and on UAVs for years.


158
0:6:11,103 --> 0:6:13,605
He's written dozens
of scientific papers


159
0:6:13,605 --> 0:6:16,408
and analyzed UAV designs
for the military.


160
0:6:16,408 --> 0:6:18,343
If we can impress him
with our drone,


161
0:6:18,343 --> 0:6:20,212
I think we can
get it seen by DARPA.


162
0:6:20,212 --> 0:6:22,981
ROG: He's got this guy
coming over here tomorrow,


163
0:6:22,981 --> 0:6:25,17
and we've got tons of stuff
to figure out.


164
0:6:25,17 --> 0:6:27,486
And I don't see how we can be
half done by then.


165
0:6:27,486 --> 0:6:31,223
TRAVIS: You and Pete figure out
why that gun didn't fire


166
0:6:31,223 --> 0:6:34,92
and figure out what we gotta do
to do four motors at once.


167
0:6:34,92 --> 0:6:36,195
If we're gonna have
four motors on this thing,


168
0:6:36,195 --> 0:6:38,33
then we're gonna need something
to attach them to.


169
0:6:38,33 --> 0:6:40,132
So I sent Rog
out to the hardware store


170
0:6:40,132 --> 0:6:47,94
to find us some kind
of lightweight frame.


171
0:6:47,94 --> 0:6:53,745
ROG: Wait a minute now.


172
0:6:53,745 --> 0:6:58,116
ROG: When I was driving by,
I saw at my buddy's house,


173
0:6:58,116 --> 0:6:59,551
his wife was out in the yard,


174
0:6:59,551 --> 0:7:1,854
and his little girl
was doing the hula-hoop.


175
0:7:1,854 --> 0:7:5,9
And I got an idea.


176
0:7:5,9 --> 0:7:7,125
We ain't gonna
have to build a frame.


177
0:7:7,125 --> 0:7:12,598
A hula-hoop's already
made like that, you know.


178
0:7:12,598 --> 0:7:14,766
So I did a little bartering,


179
0:7:14,766 --> 0:7:16,935
and I traded my hat
for the hula-hoop.


180
0:7:16,935 --> 0:7:18,837
And I think I got
a pretty fair deal.


181
0:7:18,837 --> 0:7:20,272
PETE: I've got them ready.


182
0:7:20,272 --> 0:7:22,207
TRAVIS: That's all right.
DADDY: Hold that thing up level.


183
0:7:22,207 --> 0:7:23,675
[horn honking]


184
0:7:23,675 --> 0:7:26,44
DADDY: Oh, man.


185
0:7:26,44 --> 0:7:30,48
TRAVIS: We sent Rog out
to get a frame for our drone,


186
0:7:30,48 --> 0:7:32,451
and here he comes back
with a hula-hoop.


187
0:7:32,451 --> 0:7:34,52
What are you gonna do
with a hula-hoop?


188
0:7:34,52 --> 0:7:35,721
You working on
your girly figure?


189
0:7:35,721 --> 0:7:37,389
ROG: I figure
we put that as a base.


190
0:7:37,389 --> 0:7:38,39
DADDY: That's not a bad idea.


191
0:7:38,39 --> 0:7:39,992
TRAVIS:
The plastic is fairly rigid.


192
0:7:39,992 --> 0:7:42,261
I think it's gonna work great
for our airframe structure.


193
0:7:42,261 --> 0:7:45,464
ROG: Anything for
the project of the week.


194
0:7:45,464 --> 0:7:47,866
TRAVIS: Now that
we've got the frame,


195
0:7:47,866 --> 0:7:51,103
we've got to get back to
figuring out that trigger.


196
0:7:51,103 --> 0:7:53,605
When we pushed the joystick
on the remote control,


197
0:7:53,605 --> 0:7:54,806
the motor is supposed to turn


198
0:7:54,806 --> 0:7:58,76
and drive a plastic finger
into the trigger,


199
0:7:58,76 --> 0:8:0,445
but that motor just won't move.


200
0:8:0,445 --> 0:8:2,481
MICHAEL: It ain't going.
TRAVIS: I heard something.


201
0:8:2,481 --> 0:8:4,516
You don't reckon
the servo is stuck, do you?


202
0:8:4,516 --> 0:8:7,152
MICHAEL: You know what?
The trim might not be set right.


203
0:8:7,152 --> 0:8:9,821
Uncle Travis thinks
the servo motor is broken,


204
0:8:9,821 --> 0:8:11,49
but I doubt it.


205
0:8:11,49 --> 0:8:14,192
I think the remote controller
isn't set up right.


206
0:8:14,192 --> 0:8:16,929
I can make a simple adjustment
to something called the trim.


207
0:8:16,929 --> 0:8:18,463
That should fix the problem.


208
0:8:18,463 --> 0:8:21,433
It'd be as easy
as adjusting the dial.


209
0:8:21,433 --> 0:8:24,469
But sometimes Uncle Travis has
just got to do things his way.


210
0:8:24,469 --> 0:8:26,672
TRAVIS: Maybe I'll just
change the servo out.


211
0:8:26,672 --> 0:8:28,34
Do we have an extra one?
MICHAEL: Check the trim.


212
0:8:28,34 --> 0:8:30,976
TRAVIS: I think it's something
wrong with that servo.


213
0:8:30,976 --> 0:8:33,979
MICHAEL: So we did exactly
what he told us to.


214
0:8:33,979 --> 0:8:36,715
We replaced the servo.
And guess what?


215
0:8:36,715 --> 0:8:38,617
We put a brand-new
servo on here,


216
0:8:38,617 --> 0:8:40,786
and it's doing the same thing.
It ain't the servo.


217
0:8:40,786 --> 0:8:42,621
TRAVIS: Look, you got to figure
this part out


218
0:8:42,621 --> 0:8:45,39
'cause this is a main part
of the dag gum UAV, right?


219
0:8:45,39 --> 0:8:46,692
MICHAEL: We're trying.


220
0:8:46,692 --> 0:8:48,46
TRAVIS: Don't try. Do it!


221
0:8:48,46 --> 0:8:50,796
MICHAEL: Just give us some time.
TRAVIS: All right.


222
0:8:50,796 --> 0:8:52,64
MICHAEL: Try that trim.


223
0:8:52,64 --> 0:8:53,332
Adjust that--


224
0:8:53,332 --> 0:8:55,167
whatever way it is,
throw it all the way.


225
0:8:55,167 --> 0:9:1,106
TRAVIS: Oh!
What the crap was that?


226
0:9:1,106 --> 0:9:2,374
DADDY: These
experiments are dangerous.


227
0:9:2,374 --> 0:9:4,676
These guys are
real rocket scientists.


228
0:9:4,676 --> 0:9:6,678
Don't try this at home.


229
0:9:6,678 --> 0:9:9,414
TRAVIS: We're making
a portable weaponized drone


230
0:9:9,414 --> 0:9:11,483
to match
Defense Department specs.


231
0:9:11,483 --> 0:9:13,952
It's got to fly two miles,
send back video,


232
0:9:13,952 --> 0:9:15,887
and fit in a backpack.


233
0:9:15,887 --> 0:9:20,359
And there's a UAV expert who's
gonna be here in just 24 hours


234
0:9:20,359 --> 0:9:23,161
who's gonna tell us
if it makes the grade.


235
0:9:23,161 --> 0:9:26,98
MICHAEL: Try that trim. That's
the only thing we hadn't tried.


236
0:9:26,98 --> 0:9:29,67
Adjust that--whatever way it is,
throw it all the way--


237
0:9:29,67 --> 0:9:31,436
TRAVIS: Oh!
What the crap was that?


238
0:9:31,436 --> 0:9:33,605
Did you all just shoot
a paintball on Daddy's floor?


239
0:9:33,605 --> 0:9:36,241
MICHAEL: No. I don't think
it was a paintball.


240
0:9:36,241 --> 0:9:38,243
TRAVIS: You ain't got
the paintball, but did it go?


241
0:9:38,243 --> 0:9:39,544
MICHAEL: I think it just--yeah.


242
0:9:39,544 --> 0:9:41,847
TRAVIS: Do it again.
Pete, are you making it do that?


243
0:9:41,847 --> 0:9:44,116
PETE: Yup.
TRAVIS: Hey, hey, look at that.


244
0:9:44,116 --> 0:9:46,818
TRAVIS: He was right.
Michael said it was the trim,


245
0:9:46,818 --> 0:9:48,186
and I should have
listened to him.


246
0:9:48,186 --> 0:9:50,656
You sure I didn't
tell you to check that?


247
0:9:50,656 --> 0:9:51,99
Now, that that's fixed,


248
0:9:51,99 --> 0:9:54,259
Michael and Pete are
working on the remote video


249
0:9:54,259 --> 0:9:57,295
that mission control will use
to control the drone.


250
0:9:57,295 --> 0:9:59,164
We're gonna make it
so that a single soldier


251
0:9:59,164 --> 0:10:1,66
can control the drone
from the field,


252
0:10:1,66 --> 0:10:3,735
but if he needs to,
he can hand off that control


253
0:10:3,735 --> 0:10:6,138
back to home base
that's miles and miles away.


254
0:10:6,138 --> 0:10:8,106
PETE: Was that about 100 feet?


255
0:10:8,106 --> 0:10:10,375
MICHAEL: Yeah, that's
crystal clear, ain't it?


256
0:10:10,375 --> 0:10:11,343
PETE: That's good.


257
0:10:11,343 --> 0:10:12,344
TRAVIS:
Once Rog finished putting


258
0:10:12,344 --> 0:10:14,46
all the motors and blades on,


259
0:10:14,46 --> 0:10:16,381
we created
some unique landing gear.


260
0:10:16,381 --> 0:10:19,718
Daddy, we're gonna be using
your cat fishing noodle.


261
0:10:19,718 --> 0:10:21,253
DADDY: I always have
some of those noodles


262
0:10:21,253 --> 0:10:23,622
you use in the pool
for kids to play with.


263
0:10:23,622 --> 0:10:25,323
I use them for fishing.


264
0:10:25,323 --> 0:10:28,427
Never imagined we'd be
using them for a DARPA drone.


265
0:10:28,427 --> 0:10:31,329
TRAVIS: Cut me off
four of them beer-can high.


266
0:10:31,329 --> 0:10:32,698
ROG: Beer-can high?


267
0:10:32,698 --> 0:10:36,68
Ain't that a unit of measurement
that the Egyptians used?


268
0:10:36,68 --> 0:10:39,337
TRAVIS: They can zip-tie
all the way through it.


269
0:10:39,337 --> 0:10:41,473
All the way,
just set 'em right on there.


270
0:10:41,473 --> 0:10:43,575
Here, Michael.


271
0:10:43,575 --> 0:10:46,945
Hey, you two settle down
before I get on the both of you.


272
0:10:46,945 --> 0:10:47,979
I think we're done.


273
0:10:47,979 --> 0:10:49,448
All we gotta do
is hook the power up,


274
0:10:49,448 --> 0:10:50,816
and we're ready to go.


275
0:10:50,816 --> 0:10:52,15
There's still
a lot to figure out,


276
0:10:52,15 --> 0:10:54,186
but if this thing doesn't work,
we're screwed.


277
0:10:54,186 --> 0:10:58,9
We're gonna see if it flies.


278
0:10:58,9 --> 0:11:0,659
DADDY: I don't think
he's a very experienced driver.


279
0:11:0,659 --> 0:11:4,73
I'm thinking he's probably gonna
run the thing into us.


280
0:11:4,73 --> 0:11:7,365
TRAVIS: Everybody be ready.


281
0:11:7,365 --> 0:11:11,436
Here we go.


282
0:11:11,436 --> 0:11:13,371
Coming up with the throttle.


283
0:11:13,371 --> 0:11:23,181
[popping]


284
0:11:23,181 --> 0:11:26,485
Watch out now.


285
0:11:26,485 --> 0:11:33,58
DADDY: By George,
it does fly, don't it?


286
0:11:33,58 --> 0:11:35,26
Look out for my truck.


287
0:11:35,26 --> 0:11:38,196
TRAVIS: There it goes!


288
0:11:38,196 --> 0:11:46,304
Oh!


289
0:11:46,304 --> 0:11:48,306
Oh, crap!


290
0:11:48,306 --> 0:11:51,409
Something happened,
it went unstable.


291
0:11:51,409 --> 0:11:53,612
ROG: He started
running that thing.


292
0:11:53,612 --> 0:11:55,48
I thought he had it,
and I thought, man,


293
0:11:55,48 --> 0:11:57,716
'cause he just missed
this one tree over here.


294
0:11:57,716 --> 0:12:2,587
And he hit
these limbs right here.


295
0:12:2,587 --> 0:12:4,99
And I didn't know he
couldn't drive that thing, man.


296
0:12:4,99 --> 0:12:6,424
TRAVIS: There's some things
that come loose.


297
0:12:6,424 --> 0:12:7,526
I'm gonna have to go
back through all the connections


298
0:12:7,526 --> 0:12:9,6
and make sure it works.


299
0:12:9,6 --> 0:12:10,896
DADDY: What do you think, son?
What do you think happened?


300
0:12:10,896 --> 0:12:12,631
Did it just get out of range
of the controls


301
0:12:12,631 --> 0:12:13,431
where it wouldn't respond?


302
0:12:13,431 --> 0:12:15,3
TRAVIS: It was pilot error.


303
0:12:15,3 --> 0:12:17,302
I couldn't tell
where I was looking,


304
0:12:17,302 --> 0:12:20,71
and I think I just
lost orientation


305
0:12:20,71 --> 0:12:21,907
of where was the front
and where was the back,


306
0:12:21,907 --> 0:12:24,409
and when I made the correction,
it wasn't the right way.


307
0:12:24,409 --> 0:12:26,244
I either need more practice


308
0:12:26,244 --> 0:12:27,913
or figure out
a better way to do it.


309
0:12:27,913 --> 0:12:29,581
But that's after
we fix the thing


310
0:12:29,581 --> 0:12:31,95
back to where we had it.


311
0:12:31,95 --> 0:12:33,351
I'm getting nervous


312
0:12:33,351 --> 0:12:35,453
because we still have to do
a flight test in the morning


313
0:12:35,453 --> 0:12:36,888
before the expert gets here.


314
0:12:36,888 --> 0:12:38,69
It's gonna be
a long night, man,


315
0:12:38,69 --> 0:12:39,925
'cause we ain't even
thought about


316
0:12:39,925 --> 0:12:41,293
how to put the rockets on there,


317
0:12:41,293 --> 0:12:42,694
y'all ain't figured out
how to ignite 'em,


318
0:12:42,694 --> 0:12:44,596
we still got to get
a gun mount on here.


319
0:12:44,596 --> 0:12:46,598
We're a long way.


320
0:12:46,598 --> 0:12:51,503
At least we got
a cooler full of beer.


321
0:12:51,503 --> 0:12:53,405
Man, we worked
through the night,


322
0:12:53,405 --> 0:12:57,142
but we got it all fixed up.


323
0:12:57,142 --> 0:12:58,944
We're gonna do this test


324
0:12:58,944 --> 0:13:1,213
where we see how far of a range
we can go with the helicopter


325
0:13:1,213 --> 0:13:3,114
and what kind of video
we can get back.


326
0:13:3,114 --> 0:13:4,783
PETE: We're good with picture.


327
0:13:4,783 --> 0:13:7,185
TRAVIS: I'm gonna come in there
and fly it from the video then.


328
0:13:7,185 --> 0:13:10,21
Then we got that UAV expert
gonna be here in a little while.


329
0:13:10,21 --> 0:13:11,523
Gonna throttle up.


330
0:13:11,523 --> 0:13:25,3
There we go.


331
0:13:25,3 --> 0:13:28,473
ROG: I mean, it was just cool
to be in the garage


332
0:13:28,473 --> 0:13:31,243
and watch that thing fly.


333
0:13:31,243 --> 0:13:34,813
But the best was when we flew
over our buddy Sloth's house.


334
0:13:34,813 --> 0:13:36,548
TRAVIS: Sloth. What's he doing?


335
0:13:36,548 --> 0:13:37,782
MICHAEL:
Looks like he's working.


336
0:13:37,782 --> 0:13:39,15
ROG: He's looking
for Easter eggs.


337
0:13:39,15 --> 0:13:40,752
DADDY: Working my foot.


338
0:13:40,752 --> 0:13:42,821
TRAVIS: You can't throw
a beer can that high, Sloth.


339
0:13:42,821 --> 0:13:45,423
The whole time I was hovering
over Sloth's house,


340
0:13:45,423 --> 0:13:47,25
he kept throwing beer cans up.


341
0:13:47,25 --> 0:13:50,195
He knew that Rog was probably
behind it somehow or other.


342
0:13:50,195 --> 0:13:52,163
Boy, that one got fairly close.
Did you see that one?


343
0:13:52,163 --> 0:13:53,365
He's got a pretty good arm.


344
0:13:53,365 --> 0:13:55,5
I could have messed
with Sloth all day.


345
0:13:55,5 --> 0:13:56,801
Here, I'm gonna
get on outta there.


346
0:13:56,801 --> 0:13:58,87
ROG: Fly that thing home.


347
0:13:58,87 --> 0:14:1,106
TRAVIS:
We had to fly the drone home


348
0:14:1,106 --> 0:14:3,108
so we could continue
to work on it.


349
0:14:3,108 --> 0:14:5,1
We got our UAV
back in one piece.


350
0:14:5,1 --> 0:14:7,812
Now that we know we can control
it better with video,


351
0:14:7,812 --> 0:14:9,781
we still got to
put that gun on there,


352
0:14:9,781 --> 0:14:12,17
and we've still got to put
that rocket on there.


353
0:14:12,17 --> 0:14:14,185
Now, the other big requirement
of the DARPA challenge


354
0:14:14,185 --> 0:14:15,987
is getting this thing
to fit in a backpack.


355
0:14:15,987 --> 0:14:18,89
With all the setbacks,


356
0:14:18,89 --> 0:14:20,458
I just haven't had
any time to work on that.


357
0:14:20,458 --> 0:14:23,261
But Michael and Pete assure me
they've got that covered.


358
0:14:23,261 --> 0:14:25,96
I guess we'll just
have to wait and see.


359
0:14:25,96 --> 0:14:27,866
First, Michael has got to
get our rockets working.


360
0:14:27,866 --> 0:14:30,335
Michael, you about figured out
how to fire them rockets yet?


361
0:14:30,335 --> 0:14:32,37
MICHAEL:
Yeah, we're programming it.


362
0:14:32,37 --> 0:14:33,772
TRAVIS: While Michael
worked on that,


363
0:14:33,772 --> 0:14:36,675
Rog figured out how to
mount the gun to our drone.


364
0:14:36,675 --> 0:14:39,311
ROG: We got that gunner
aimed right at you.


365
0:14:39,311 --> 0:14:40,912
TRAVIS: Look at what he's done.


366
0:14:40,912 --> 0:14:42,347
He's put the gun
on the bottom of it.


367
0:14:42,347 --> 0:14:44,416
It looks pretty good.
It's gonna work out just fine.


368
0:14:44,416 --> 0:14:47,185
Michael, I got to have
that circuit finished


369
0:14:47,185 --> 0:14:48,753
to fire them rockets.


370
0:14:48,753 --> 0:14:50,855
So go finish that circuit.


371
0:14:50,855 --> 0:14:52,29
We're completing our arsenal


372
0:14:52,29 --> 0:14:54,125
with rocket-propelled
explosives.


373
0:14:54,125 --> 0:14:55,727
But to fit them below the gun,


374
0:14:55,727 --> 0:14:58,163
we have to add legs
to the bottom.


375
0:14:58,163 --> 0:15:0,198
Of course this all
just adds more weight,


376
0:15:0,198 --> 0:15:3,134
but if we want to impress DARPA,
we have to add those rockets.


377
0:15:3,134 --> 0:15:5,236
ROG: Where's that feller at?


378
0:15:5,236 --> 0:15:6,504
TRAVIS: Dr. Brian Landrum


379
0:15:6,504 --> 0:15:8,206
from the University of Alabama
Huntsville


380
0:15:8,206 --> 0:15:10,275
will be here any minute.


381
0:15:10,275 --> 0:15:13,311
He's an expert on drone design
for the Defense Department.


382
0:15:13,311 --> 0:15:15,28
So he's the perfect guy
to judge what we're doing.


383
0:15:15,28 --> 0:15:17,882
DADDY: When Dr. Landrum sees it,


384
0:15:17,882 --> 0:15:20,685
he's got to get over
his first initial shock.


385
0:15:20,685 --> 0:15:23,254
I mean, this thing's built
by the Rocket City Rednecks.


386
0:15:23,254 --> 0:15:26,758
It's built out of hula-hoops
and fun noodles.


387
0:15:26,758 --> 0:15:28,36
He's gonna think,
"What in the world?"


388
0:15:28,36 --> 0:15:30,829
PETE: We want to do
one more test.


389
0:15:30,829 --> 0:15:32,63
And the big question is,


390
0:15:32,63 --> 0:15:34,265
with all this weight
and all these new weapons,


391
0:15:34,265 --> 0:15:36,301
will this thing
even get off the ground?


392
0:15:36,301 --> 0:15:38,169
MICHAEL: We ready?
Here we go.


393
0:15:38,169 --> 0:15:41,906
TRAVIS:
Alright, bring it up Michael.


394
0:15:41,906 --> 0:15:46,211
There we go.


395
0:15:46,211 --> 0:15:48,813
What's going on?
MICHAEL: It won't come up.


396
0:15:48,813 --> 0:15:50,382
TRAVIS:
With all this extra weight,


397
0:15:50,382 --> 0:15:53,451
our drone is really
struggling to get enough lift.


398
0:15:53,451 --> 0:15:57,722
ROG: Oh, oh, no!


399
0:15:57,722 --> 0:16:4,662
TRAVIS: Watch out.
ROG: Don't touch that!


400
0:16:4,662 --> 0:16:5,73
TRAVIS: We built a portable
weaponized drone


401
0:16:5,73 --> 0:16:7,399
for the DARPA challenge


402
0:16:7,399 --> 0:16:10,602
and invited a UAV expert,
Dr. Brian Landrum,


403
0:16:10,602 --> 0:16:13,805
to evaluate our design
during today's field test.


404
0:16:13,805 --> 0:16:16,174
TRAVIS: Oh, no, no, no!


405
0:16:16,174 --> 0:16:19,944
But his arrival
wasn't exactly perfectly timed.


406
0:16:19,944 --> 0:16:21,446
The dag-gum UAV crashed


407
0:16:21,446 --> 0:16:24,182
right as Dr. Landrum's
driving up.


408
0:16:24,182 --> 0:16:26,718
DADDY: Rockets going off,
hitting the trees...


409
0:16:26,718 --> 0:16:29,254
TRAVIS: Hey!
Hey, there's Dr. Landrum.


410
0:16:29,254 --> 0:16:30,755
I just played it cool,


411
0:16:30,755 --> 0:16:33,391
hoping that he wouldn't notice
that something was really wrong.


412
0:16:33,391 --> 0:16:37,729
ROG: I know he saw that.


413
0:16:37,729 --> 0:16:40,498
TRAVIS: We've had a few
little ups and downs.


414
0:16:40,498 --> 0:16:42,934
We just did
a rocket test, and...


415
0:16:42,934 --> 0:16:44,569
DR. LANDRUM:
Rockets and guns, huh?


416
0:16:44,569 --> 0:16:46,371
TRAVIS: Rockets and guns
and helicopters.


417
0:16:46,371 --> 0:16:48,239
LANDRUM: Oh, well,
that's a mix.


418
0:16:48,239 --> 0:16:49,808
TRAVIS:
We're gonna tweak some things,


419
0:16:49,808 --> 0:16:53,44
so, Daddy, why don't you
take him over to the test field,


420
0:16:53,44 --> 0:16:54,779
and we'll meet y'all over there
in a couple minutes.


421
0:16:54,779 --> 0:16:58,16
We've set up
a field test with targets


422
0:16:58,16 --> 0:16:59,751
to put the drone
through its paces.


423
0:16:59,751 --> 0:17:1,319
But we're in trouble.


424
0:17:1,319 --> 0:17:3,555
We've only got a few minutes
really to fix this thing,


425
0:17:3,555 --> 0:17:7,125
so the next test flight is gonna
be in front of the UAV expert.


426
0:17:7,125 --> 0:17:8,526
ROG: We put it back together.


427
0:17:8,526 --> 0:17:9,961
We're expecting it to work.


428
0:17:9,961 --> 0:17:12,664
At least that's what
we're telling the expert guy.


429
0:17:12,664 --> 0:17:16,768
TRAVIS: Turns out those legs we
added to the bottom of the drone


430
0:17:16,768 --> 0:17:19,938
affected the balance just enough
to keep it from flying right.


431
0:17:19,938 --> 0:17:21,873
So we redistributed
some of the weight.


432
0:17:21,873 --> 0:17:24,876
I think that should do it.


433
0:17:24,876 --> 0:17:26,611
The key thing for this project


434
0:17:26,611 --> 0:17:28,48
is that it can be carried
in a backpack


435
0:17:28,48 --> 0:17:30,548
by a single soldier
in the field.


436
0:17:30,548 --> 0:17:33,17
Now, I've assigned Michael
and Pete to solve that problem.


437
0:17:33,17 --> 0:17:42,56
I'm kind of excited to see
what they've come up with.


438
0:17:42,56 --> 0:17:44,929
Is this the backpack you made?


439
0:17:44,929 --> 0:17:48,99
MICHAEL: Well, it's a backpack.
You said, "Protect the UAV."


440
0:17:48,99 --> 0:17:50,335
TRAVIS: Can you even
get that thing on?


441
0:17:50,335 --> 0:17:52,971
It's this huge box that
you just slide the thing in.


442
0:17:52,971 --> 0:17:54,939
There's no disassembly
of the UAV at all.


443
0:17:54,939 --> 0:17:57,976
I can't see a soldier
wearing that into the field.


444
0:17:57,976 --> 0:18:0,44
But it is too late
to fix that now.


445
0:18:0,44 --> 0:18:2,113
Hopefully we can
impress Dr. Landrum


446
0:18:2,113 --> 0:18:4,649
with other aspects
of our design.


447
0:18:4,649 --> 0:18:6,417
DADDY: Yeah, there's some
pressure on it


448
0:18:6,417 --> 0:18:7,819
because you don't want
to mess up


449
0:18:7,819 --> 0:18:9,721
in front of a guy like that.


450
0:18:9,721 --> 0:18:12,59
And I figure we're about to.


451
0:18:12,59 --> 0:18:14,659
LANDRUM: I finally got a good
look at their drone design,


452
0:18:14,659 --> 0:18:16,528
and it's unique,
to say the least,


453
0:18:16,528 --> 0:18:18,129
but I'm gonna
reserve my judgment


454
0:18:18,129 --> 0:18:19,864
till I see it in action.


455
0:18:19,864 --> 0:18:21,432
TRAVIS: Put it in,
be careful.


456
0:18:21,432 --> 0:18:22,734
Don't tear up the rockets
or whatever.


457
0:18:22,734 --> 0:18:24,435
Y'all figure that out.


458
0:18:24,435 --> 0:18:25,87
Alright, so, Brian,
what we're gonna do


459
0:18:25,87 --> 0:18:28,72
is I've set up a war game.


460
0:18:28,72 --> 0:18:30,475
And we're gonna put Rog
out there somewhere.


461
0:18:30,475 --> 0:18:32,343
He's gonna take the gun,
he's gonna go hide,


462
0:18:32,343 --> 0:18:33,845
and he's gonna be a sniper.


463
0:18:33,845 --> 0:18:35,213
So then I'm gonna crawl in


464
0:18:35,213 --> 0:18:36,781
through the woods
somewhere here,


465
0:18:36,781 --> 0:18:37,916
and I'm gonna
come out and decide


466
0:18:37,916 --> 0:18:40,685
this is the right place
to deploy the UAV.


467
0:18:40,685 --> 0:18:42,22
And then we're gonna launch it.


468
0:18:42,22 --> 0:18:44,789
It can be controlled from the
tactical operations center here,


469
0:18:44,789 --> 0:18:47,25
and you guys will be able to
watch it on the big screen.


470
0:18:47,25 --> 0:18:49,427
And then, when we're done
taking out the sniper,


471
0:18:49,427 --> 0:18:51,663
we've got some
larger vehicles over the hill


472
0:18:51,663 --> 0:18:53,398
that we're gonna go
and take out with the rockets.


473
0:18:53,398 --> 0:18:56,734
Michael, did you put targets
out there like I said to?


474
0:18:56,734 --> 0:18:58,87
MICHAEL: You will be surprised
when you head out there.


475
0:18:58,87 --> 0:19:0,738
TRAVIS: So you did put
some targets out there.


476
0:19:0,738 --> 0:19:2,74
Rog and I
got our paintball gear on,


477
0:19:2,74 --> 0:19:5,977
and he took off
to go hide and play sniper.


478
0:19:5,977 --> 0:19:7,979
ROG: Yeah, I had
a real good hiding spot.


479
0:19:7,979 --> 0:19:9,314
It was real snaky.


480
0:19:9,314 --> 0:19:11,115
You know how snipers
like snaky spots.


481
0:19:11,115 --> 0:19:13,151
TRAVIS: Then Michael
helped me get the backpack on.


482
0:19:13,151 --> 0:19:16,2
I started easing out
into the grass and hiding,


483
0:19:16,2 --> 0:19:18,356
trying to find a good place
that I could deploy this thing


484
0:19:18,356 --> 0:19:19,524
and then go look for Rog.


485
0:19:19,524 --> 0:19:21,125
TRAVIS: Hey, Michael.
MICHAEL: Yeah, go ahead.


486
0:19:21,125 --> 0:19:22,393
TRAVIS: I think I found
a pretty good spot.


487
0:19:22,393 --> 0:19:24,429
Rog can't be too far away,


488
0:19:24,429 --> 0:19:26,598
so I'm gonna start getting ready
to deploy this thing.


489
0:19:26,598 --> 0:19:34,38
MICHAEL: 10-4. We're set up,
and we're waiting on a signal.


490
0:19:34,38 --> 0:19:48,353
TRAVIS: Here we go.


491
0:19:48,353 --> 0:19:49,954
I took off running,


492
0:19:49,954 --> 0:19:55,693
and I turned control over to
Daddy back at the command post.


493
0:19:55,693 --> 0:19:57,228
Shoot him.


494
0:19:57,228 --> 0:19:59,364
If you can find Rog,
start shooting him.


495
0:19:59,364 --> 0:20:2,467
ROG: Yeah, I went both guns
blazing at the drone.


496
0:20:2,467 --> 0:20:3,735
It wasn't doing anything.


497
0:20:3,735 --> 0:20:9,941
The propellers
would just eat it up.


498
0:20:9,941 --> 0:20:12,277
DADDY: I'm looking at Rog,
and I'm thinking,


499
0:20:12,277 --> 0:20:14,812
"This is my chance.
I've got him in my sites,"


500
0:20:14,812 --> 0:20:16,481
so I pressed the trigger.


501
0:20:16,481 --> 0:20:19,45
ROG: You got me!


502
0:20:19,45 --> 0:20:20,918
DADDY: I got Rog.


503
0:20:20,918 --> 0:20:22,52
Now, he said
he wasn't gonna get hit,


504
0:20:22,52 --> 0:20:23,721
and I agreed with him.


505
0:20:23,721 --> 0:20:24,989
There's no way we'd hit him.


506
0:20:24,989 --> 0:20:26,591
MICHAEL: Oh, you got him!


507
0:20:26,591 --> 0:20:28,192
DADDY: And I zapped him
right in the chest.


508
0:20:28,192 --> 0:20:30,862
ROG: I'm out!


509
0:20:30,862 --> 0:20:32,463
LANDRUM: For this next test,


510
0:20:32,463 --> 0:20:34,432
I'm not so sure they're gonna
be able to hit their targets


511
0:20:34,432 --> 0:20:36,167
with these rockets.


512
0:20:36,167 --> 0:20:39,7
MICHAEL: We're moving towards
the tanks and the trucks.


513
0:20:39,7 --> 0:20:40,638
DADDY: Now we're gonna try
to take out the convoy


514
0:20:40,638 --> 0:20:47,478
of tanks and trucks
with our rockets.


515
0:20:47,478 --> 0:20:51,716
Alright, here we go.


516
0:20:51,716 --> 0:20:54,752
MICHAEL: Oh, we launched
the first rocket.


517
0:20:54,752 --> 0:20:57,88
Daddy: Oh, missed--


518
0:20:57,88 --> 0:20:58,89
[laughing]


519
0:20:58,89 --> 0:21:0,992
TRAVIS: Y'all missed it.
Y'all hit it a little better.


520
0:21:0,992 --> 0:21:7,131
MICHAEL: That second shot...
Missed it on the second shot.


521
0:21:7,131 --> 0:21:8,533
Rog: Oh!


522
0:21:8,533 --> 0:21:10,368
TRAVIS: There we go! Yeah!


523
0:21:10,368 --> 0:21:11,803
When they started
firing off those rockets,


524
0:21:11,803 --> 0:21:13,438
I wasn't sure if they were
hitting anything.


525
0:21:13,438 --> 0:21:15,173
And then I saw
a big fireball go up,


526
0:21:15,173 --> 0:21:18,309
so it was clear they hit
one of the targets.


527
0:21:18,309 --> 0:21:19,711
MICHAEL: Oh, yeah.


528
0:21:19,711 --> 0:21:21,846
After I set up the targets,
I also doused them in gasoline.


529
0:21:21,846 --> 0:21:23,381
Come on, hit that thing.


530
0:21:23,381 --> 0:21:26,117
Come on, let me get
the nose down.


531
0:21:26,117 --> 0:21:27,518
There you go.


532
0:21:27,518 --> 0:21:33,558
[laughing and cheering]


533
0:21:33,558 --> 0:21:37,895
DADDY: Got him!
PETE: Good job!


534
0:21:37,895 --> 0:21:40,832
We're bringing this thing home.
We got all three targets.


535
0:21:40,832 --> 0:21:45,937
Good shooting.
MICHAEL: That's incredible.


536
0:21:45,937 --> 0:21:47,905
DADDY: I figured we'd crash
and tear it up


537
0:21:47,905 --> 0:21:49,507
like we'd been doing,


538
0:21:49,507 --> 0:21:51,509
but we actually got
the thing back in one piece.


539
0:21:51,509 --> 0:21:52,777
TRAVIS: Did you get him?


540
0:21:52,777 --> 0:21:54,112
DADDY: We shot him.


541
0:21:54,112 --> 0:21:55,913
ROG: Which one of y'all
shot me, man?


542
0:21:55,913 --> 0:21:57,415
TRAVIS: Look at that
right there. Who got him?


543
0:21:57,415 --> 0:21:58,783
MICHAEL: That was Papaw.


544
0:21:58,783 --> 0:22:1,85
TRAVIS: That's good shooting,
Daddy. Look at that!


545
0:22:1,85 --> 0:22:3,154
LANDRUM: Weaponizing
a small system like this,


546
0:22:3,154 --> 0:22:5,89
I really think this is something
DARPA would be interested in.


547
0:22:5,89 --> 0:22:7,759
Overall, this was
just a great test.


548
0:22:7,759 --> 0:22:9,327
I think it really has
a lot of promise.


549
0:22:9,327 --> 0:22:11,963
TRAVIS: Our UAV drone
worked really well.


550
0:22:11,963 --> 0:22:14,399
Putting rockets on there
and a gun was pretty neat.


551
0:22:14,399 --> 0:22:15,4
So I think there's
some immediate


552
0:22:15,4 --> 0:22:17,835
real-world applications
for our design.


553
0:22:17,835 --> 0:22:19,37
Hula-hoop taters,
hula-hoop taters.


554
0:22:19,37 --> 0:22:22,306
ROG: Right on, right on.


555
0:22:22,306 --> 0:22:25,143
All this talk about
real-world applications


556
0:22:25,143 --> 0:22:26,911
got me to thinking.


557
0:22:26,911 --> 0:22:31,315
So I took my boys out, and we
did a little drone fishing.


558
0:22:31,315 --> 0:22:33,551
Look at that fish!


559
0:22:33,551 --> 0:22:35,42
He's too little.
We got to throw him back.


560
0:22:35,42 --> 0:22:37,722
You want to touch him?


561
0:22:37,722 --> 0:24:37,722
Okay.
