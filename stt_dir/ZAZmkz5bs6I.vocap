###1 DOUG HODOUS: We are going to pour this right in here and
###2 look at this.
###3 STEVE SPANGLER: Ah, wow.
###4 DOUG HODOUS: Look at this, it's like magic.
###6 BECKY DITCHFIELD: I have no idea what's going to happen.
###8 STEVE SPANGLER: This is a biological stain.
###9 CARLY REED: Oh no.
###10 STEVE SPANGLER: This is just- It's fine.
###11 This is- So I bet you think this is the part of this show,
###14 where I'm going to say, don't try these experiments at home.
###17 And you're right.
###18 Except there is one experiment we want you to try.
###20 Just look for the graphic that's right here
###22 that says, try it.
###23 That's your signal that you can try that
###25 experiment at home.
###26 Everything else, off limits.
###27 Look, I've already given you homework, and the show hasn't
###29 even started.
###31 I'm Steve Spangler, and I'm all about making science fun.
###34 For the last 20 years I've been teaching ways to turn
###37 ordinary science experiments into unforgettable learning
###40 experiences.
###41 I have an amazing team, who will do whatever it takes to
###44 affect the way people think about science.
###47 And to do that I live by one model- make it big, do it
###50 right, give it class.
###52 
###57 You know, I think it's true, you never actually forget the
###59 great teachers that you had in your life.
###61 And when I go back and think about my high school, Heritage
###64 High School and the Littleton Public Schools,
###66 one guy sticks out.
###67 His name is Doug Hodous.
###68 And he was my very first chemistry teacher.
###71 This is the guy that made things blow up, and the funny
###73 smells, and so forth.
###75 And so I thought today we'd go back to Heritage High School,
###78 and see if we can take him back to his old class, and
###80 have a little lesson in chemistry.
###81 
###85 DOUG HODOUS: Hey, Steve.
###85 How are you?
###87 You're looking good.
###88 STEVE SPANGLER: So I walk in and you're no longer here,
###90 because they kicked you out 20 years ago.
###92 How long have you been retired?
###94 DOUG HODOUS: It's been a long, long time.
###95 1996.
###97 '97.
###98 STEVE SPANGLER: Look at this.
###98 My chemistry teacher, he is here.
###100 He's the guy that they made sure-- well there's a lot of
###103 stories about sneaking out, and doing demos, and so forth.
###105 But I was going to ask you.
###106 Let's go back into at the class.
###108 Let's see if we can rummage around a little bit.
###110 And I'd love to have you do--
###111 I want disappearing ink.
###112 DOUG HODOUS: Oh.
###112 Excellent.
###112 STEVE SPANGLER: That's what I want.
###113 I want your formula for disappearing ink.
###115 DOUG HODOUS: Oh, that would be a lot of fun.
###117 Thanks for inviting me.
###118 STEVE SPANGLER: Absolutely.
###120 Welcome back to your old classroom.
###122 Some things don't change, do they?
###124 DOUG HODOUS: Well--
###125 What do they call this, Steve?
###126 I used to a chalkboard.
###127 STEVE SPANGLER: It's a dry erase board.
###129 And when you get older you forget--
###130 there used to be chalk.
###132 There used to be some huge demos that we would do here.
###135 And you would ask me to come up with some of the demos that
###139 you would do.
###139 And so I got to be your lab assistant.
###140 It's a pretty smart decision on your part to make me your
###144 lab assistant, right?
###144 DOUG HODOUS: Well, if--
###146 the fact we know, when you were in my AP chemistry class
###148 as a junior.
###149 And then I thought, because you had passed and done well
###152 on the exam, I thought maybe you would be an appropriate
###155 person for you and Todd, who later on became a doctor, to
###158 be my lab assistants.
###160 Well, that was a mistake.
###160 STEVE SPANGLER: Yeah, it was.
###161 OK.
###161 So.
###163 But there were some pretty good explosions.
###164 DOUG HODOUS: Oh, yeah.
###165 STEVE SPANGLER: There was something very cool that you
###166 did with disappearing ink.
###167 And so what I'd like to do is to go back in the lab.
###169 DOUG HODOUS: Oh yeah.
###169 STEVE SPANGLER: And show me just your formula for
###170 disappearing ink.
###171 DOUG HODOUS: I'd love to.
###171 STEVE SPANGLER: All into this.
###172 DOUG HODOUS: It'd be great.
###173 Yeah, sure
###174 STEVE SPANGLER: Let's go look at that.
###176 Look at this, you even dressed the part.
###178 I love this.
###178 DOUG HODOUS: Yes, I your always want to look like a
###181 professional.
###181 STEVE SPANGLER: And I love this, too.
###182 Oh wait, you've got this.
###185 Look, and he's got his little nerd protector right here.
###188 I love that.
###188 DOUG HODOUS: It won't go in there.
###189 STEVE SPANGLER: It doesn't even fit there.
###190 DOUG HODOUS: Yeah, that's why I put it in the other po--
###191 STEVE SPANGLER: Some things never change.
###192 I'm serious.
###192 DOUG HODOUS: Yeah, that's right.
###193 STEVE SPANGLER: I'll set this off to the side--
###194 DOUG HODOUS: I didn't know I had--
###194 STEVE SPANGLER: --just in case you don't need it.
###195 DOUG HODOUS: I probably won't need it.
###196 STEVE SPANGLER: Well, I want you to show me how to make
###197 disappearing ink, but it looks like you have something else
###200 set up instead.
###200 DOUG HODOUS: Oh, yeah.
###200 I wanted to sort of give you an example of how this
###203 particular acid-based reaction is going to work.
###205 Now, if you look right here, I just have a beaker of water.
###208 I'm going to put a little bit of the sodium hydroxide.
###211 Now, this is just a one molar solution, so we're going to
###212 just add a little bit in here.
###214 STEVE SPANGLER: OK.
###214 DOUG HODOUS: OK?
###215 And it turns out, that will be colorless.
###217 STEVE SPANGLER: OK.
###218 DOUG HODOUS: Because that's a base and
###219 water, and it's colorless.
###220 STEVE SPANGLER: OK.
###220 DOUG HODOUS: Now, what we're going to add here is just a
###222 very few drops of this.
###224 And show everybody what that is.
###225 STEVE SPANGLER: It's called phenolphthalein.
###227 So--
###227 DOUG HODOUS: It's an indicator.
###228 STEVE SPANGLER: It actually starts, you said, as a powder.
###230 So we have the powder here.
###231 And so you said a couple of drops of
###233 phenolphthalein in there.
###235 DOUG HODOUS: Right.
###235 STEVE SPANGLER: All right.
###236 DOUG HODOUS: OK.
###236 And when I held it up before, you actually could not see the
###238 liquid, but it is in there.
###240 So when I add this over here, it turns
###244 a pink color because--
###245 STEVE SPANGLER: So, the solution has
###246 to be basic, right?
###247 DOUG HODOUS: This is now a basic solution, because
###248 there's sodium hydroxide in this.
###250 Now what we're going to add to the other
###252 beaker is a little acid.
###255 And of course, we know that acid and bases will neutralize
###258 each other.
###258 But we want to put a little excess acid in there.
###261 STEVE SPANGLER: Got it.
###261 So it makes a little hydrochloric acid.
###263 So we get one molar hydrochloric acid.
###265 DOUG HODOUS: Right, one molar.
###267 And when I pour this into here, of course it's going to
###269 go back to colorless again.
###271 This is magic.
###272 STEVE SPANGLER: All right, so again.
###273 What does this have to do with disappearing ink?
###275 DOUG HODOUS: Well, it's the same kind of reaction.
###277 It's going to be an acid-base reaction.
###279 And we're going to use an indicator.
###280 But this time we'll--
###281 STEVE SPANGLER: But I don't want pink ink.
###282 I really would like to have that deep dark--
###284 DOUG HODOUS: Well, every indicator
###285 has different colors.
###287 This is our indicator for disappearing ink.
###289 You can see the name right there.
###290 Thymolphthalein.
###292 STEVE SPANGLER: So thymolphthalein, just like
###293 phenolphthalein, triggers about the same pH, right in
###296 about the same range?
###297 DOUG HODOUS: Right about neutral.
###298 STEVE SPANGLER: OK.
###299 So that's what we're going to use to make the
###300 disappearing ink.
###300 DOUG HODOUS: That's exactly what we're going to use to
###301 make the disappearing ink.
###302 DOUG HODOUS: Do you remember the formula?
###303 DOUG HODOUS: Ah, no.
###304 Let's do it.
###305 STEVE SPANGLER: What you mean no?
###306 You don't remember the formula?
###307 DOUG HODOUS: I don't remember this formula.
###308 STEVE SPANGLER: Do you remember the formula to make
###310 disappearing--
###310 DOUG HODOUS: Yes, I remember.
###311 STEVE SPANGLER: This truly is-- do you know what's the
###312 greatest thing about getting old?
###314 It's that you have new friends every day that
###316 you didn't even know--
###317 DOUG HODOUS: Do you remember the formula?
###318 No.
###319 C-H-A--
###319 STEVE SPANGLER: No, I want to know the formula to make the
###322 disappearing ink.
###324 I just want a liter of the disappearing ink.
###327 DOUG HODOUS: Yes, right.
###327 STEVE SPANGLER: This is pretty much how the
###328 lectures went too.
###329 We went for about 45 minutes on stuff that we
###332 really didn't want..
###333 And, all of a sudden, bam we've got about three minutes
###335 [INTERPOSING VOICES].
###335 DOUG HODOUS: I think what we should do, opposed to what you
###337 normally did.
###337 Let's clean out these beakers, so we
###339 start with clean beakers.
###340 STEVE SPANGLER: OK, Martha, here.
###340 Why don't you just set these off to the side.
###342 Let's use this, OK?
###343 Ah, that's a new bea--
###344 Oh, we're going to do it on big time.
###345 STEVE SPANGLER: Let's do it.
###346 DOUG HODOUS: OK.
###347 Now, what we're going to do is just take about two grams of
###350 this would be appropriate.
###351 And I don't think you really have to measure this exact.
###354 So if you just put a little bit at the end of that little
###356 scooper there.
###357 Have you got some at the end of that scooper?
###359 STEVE SPANGLER: Yeah, absolutely.
###360 DOUG HODOUS: Oh, perfect.
###361 Yeah.
###361 That's about right.
###362 A little bit at the end of the tip of the
###364 spatula right there.
###365 STEVE SPANGLER: OK.
###366 DOUG HODOUS: All right.
###366 Now, what we need to do is add a little ethanol.
###369 STEVE SPANGLER: OK.
###370 DOUG HODOUS: And so the ethanol will help it dissolve.
###373 We'll get this milky white color.
###375 And we'll swirl it around trying to get it to dissolve
###377 as much as possible.
###379 STEVE SPANGLER: And then, you dilute the rest
###380 of that with what?
###381 DOUG HODOUS: Ah, We'll dilute it with water, and then we're
###384 going to add a little bit of sodium hydroxide.
###385 STEVE SPANGLER: Got it.
###386 DOUG HODOUS: We're going to make it basic.
###387 And the basic color is going to be blue.
###389 STEVE SPANGLER: All right, so let's add some of the water.
###391 DOUG HODOUS: OK, let's do that.
###392 
###396 STEVE SPANGLER: I see what you say, I mean about it being
###397 that milky white.
###398 But nobody's going to see it, because it's finally going to
###400 turn blue, right?
###401 DOUG HODOUS: Right.
###402 STEVE SPANGLER: OK.
###402 DOUG HODOUS: OK, now we're just going to add a little bit
###404 of sodium hydroxide.
###405 That's going to turn it basic.
###406 STEVE SPANGLER: You don't want too much.
###408 DOUG HODOUS: No, no, no.
###408 This is just a one molar solution, dilute solution of
###412 sodium hydroxide.
###413 Now it's basic.
###414 STEVE SPANGLER: If I remember it correctly, we've got to
###415 play with this a little bit, because when we squirt it out
###417 onto the shirt, you've got to see what amount disappears.
###420 DOUG HODOUS: Absolutely.
###420 You sort of do a trial.
###421 And you squirt it out, you see how long it lasts.
###424 You want the blue to last, well, maybe 10-20 seconds.
###427 STEVE SPANGLER: OK.
###428 So we don't need this big solution.
###429 I'll pour a small amount into this beaker, and we're set.
###431 DOUG HODOUS: Go ahead, let's put some of this in.
###434 All right, so now this is here.
###436 STEVE SPANGLER: Ah, it looks great.
###437 DOUG HODOUS: That's a perfect color.
###438 STEVE SPANGLER: OK.
###438 DOUG HODOUS: OK, let's just look at it, and
###439 see how long it lasts.
###441 STEVE SPANGLER: So it's changing back.
###442 We didn't put an acid on it, so why is it changing back?
###444 DOUG HODOUS: Well, that's because there's carbon dioxide
###446 in the air.
###447 And carbon dioxide and water, and there's a lot of water
###449 here, is slightly acidic.
###451 In fact, if you'll just blow on that.
###453 STEVE SPANGLER: OK.
###453 DOUG HODOUS: OK.
###455 
###457 STEVE SPANGLER: It will actually be a lot easier if
###458 you just spilled hydrochloric acid on somebody and it would
###461 change back really fast, but I guess that's
###462 not what you want.
###462 DOUG HODOUS: But that's going to ruin the shirt, isn't it?
###464 STEVE SPANGLER: But this, now on somebody would look really
###466 good, right?
###467 DOUG HODOUS: No.
###467 That would not look very good.
###468 STEVE SPANGLER: No, not like this.
###469 But this.
###469 It's not disappearing too fast.
###471 So for a joke.
###471 DOUG HODOUS: Oh, I'd say that's just perfect, because
###473 then they get a little concerned about it, like is
###475 this really going to go away.
###476 STEVE SPANGLER: So, like, look, see?
###477 See your little lab coat is working.
###479 How awesome is that?
###480 DOUG HODOUS: Well try over here.
###481 STEVE SPANGLER: There you go.
###482 Isn't that nice?
###483 DOUG HODOUS: Try and stay away from my skin,
###484 though, would you, Ace?
###485 STEVE SPANGLER: See, this is--
###486 DOUG HODOUS: I think we got enough, I get the idea.
###488 STEVE SPANGLER: So if you just had a source of carbon
###490 dioxide, then you could actually make this change
###492 back, is that right?
###493 DOUG HODOUS: I could get the other fellas here, but I don't
###495 believe they can breathe strong enough.
###496 STEVE SPANGLER: Never guess what I found, which I thought
###497 was absolutely perfect.
###498 DOUG HODOUS: What?
###498 They don't sell carbon dioxide.
###500 
###503 STEVE SPANGLER: Now, this being carbon dioxide, not only
###506 freezes your skin and makes you slightly
###508 static electric charged.
###510 Look, it's clearing off.
###512 DOUG HODOUS: But I'm still wet.
###514 STEVE SPANGLER: I know, you--
###516 Turn around, Ace.
###517 Turn around.
###520 DOUG HODOUS: How about a little respect here for an
###521 older person?
###522 STEVE SPANGLER: Look at this, wow.
###522 There's a static charge on you, and, ah, look, all of the
###526 ink has gone away.
###527 DOUG HODOUS: Yeah
###528 STEVE SPANGLER: Aside from this shirt, that I think you
###529 still had when I was in high school.
###530 DOUG HODOUS: Hey, you've got a dry shirt with you?
###531 Hey, take off that shirt, let's exchange
###532 here a little bit.
###533 STEVE SPANGLER: We have everything that we need for
###535 disappearing ink.
###536 Simple acid-based reaction.
###538 This is the extreme.
###539 I simply would just let it sit out there.
###541 And it would disappear.
###542 DOUG HODOUS: And I think we can see already.
###543 This has disappeared.
###543 STEVE SPANGLER: But this would scare somebody.
###544 They would really think that maybe you
###546 got some ink on them.
###547 And that would be great.
###548 DOUG HODOUS: Oh, I had a friend I did this on.
###549 He had a suit and tie on, and I put that on his new white
###550 shirt and--
###551 STEVE SPANGLER: Yeah, that's great.
###552 Doug Hodous from Heritage High School, my
###554 first chemistry teacher.
###555 You never forget the great ones.
###556 And I'm doing what I'm doing today because of this man
###559 right here.
###559 And that's it.
###560 That's all we're doing--
###563 Well, the disappearing ink that Doug Hodous helped us
###565 make is very, very cool, But no matter how cool it is--
###567 I've put some in this pipette--
###569 it's just impossible, even if loaded with a pen,
###572 to write with it.
###575 I just--
###576 it's nothing.
###577 So it's fun to squirt on people, but it's really hard
###580 to write with.
###580 So I want you to have something that you could write
###582 with that's our kind of a modern day disappearing ink,
###585 that's not at a joke shop.
###586 And I've come to find out there really is.
###588 Take a look at this.
###589 It's a pilot friction pen.
###591 There are pens that you can find at a local
###593 office supply place.
###595 And they're very, very cool because they are the kind of
###597 pen that will erase.
###599 The ink erases.
###600 So, for example, here's the pen, and you
###602 write hello, all right?
###608 So now, the ink actually is a thermochromatic ink, which
###612 means that it changes with temperature.
###614 It changes color with temperature.
###616 So watch, I can use the eraser here and erase the ink.
###620 What I'm actually doing is heating up the paper.
###622 Just like you take your hands, and you rub your hands
###624 together and you create friction.
###626 So the friction pen works just by that by creating friction.
###630 And so I can simply erase the ink.
###633 Well, It's great to be able to erase the ink like this.
###636 What would happen if you used something else
###639 to erase the ink.
###640 I don't think the manufacturers
###641 though about this.
###644 Say, I owe you some money.
###646 And I simply write a little IOU here.
###648 I owe you a $100, and I sign my name to it.
###651 That could be pretty dangerous, because the IOU
###655 might not really be the greatest IOU in the world.
###658 What if it gets hot?
###659 Here watch this.
###660 Here's our flame.
###663 Watch.
###664 Like this.
###665 The IOU seem to vanish.
###669 But I don't think it's gone for good.
###671 In fact, I can't get it back this way.
###675 What if I got it cold enough, would it come back?
###678 Let's got to the refrigerator.
###679 
###683 Let's throw it in the freezer and see what happens.
###685 
###688 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###697 Look, the message is back.
###700 And If you don't want to owe the money anymore, you just
###702 simply heat it back up again.
###703 Watch.
###704 And it's gone.
###706 So, unless you read the contract in a freezer, I don't
###709 owe the hundred bucks.
###711 So here's a challenge that's kind of fun.
###714 You can write a secret message If you want to.
###716 And you could use a combination of a regular pen
###719 that won't vanish, and of course, this
###721 friction pen from Pilot.
###723 OK.
###723 So, let's just say, to make it easy, you're just doing
###726 numbers real fast.
###727 So let's write numbers the way that a
###729 calculator would have numbers.
###731 Pretty easy now to change these.
###734 This was the permanent pen.
###736 This is the friction pen.
###738 So, here, let's change this up.
###739 Let's make this one a four right here.
###742 This is our secret message.
###744 Let see what happen when we heat it up.
###746 
###749 Here you go.
###751 One through ten.
###753 My video guy came up with this.
###754 He wanted me to look at this message.
###756 This is his secret message.
###758 Watch out, the guy shooting potatoes is Steve Spangler,
###761 who wants to be a special effects artist in Hollywood.
###764 This is the secret message.
###766 Let's see what It really says.
###769 Watch.
###771 Watch the.
###773 Watch the.
###775 Watch the Spangler effect!
###778 So here's what I want you to do.
###779 Go get yourself some of these friction pens and come up with
###781 your own secret message.
###783 Some cool thing that appears.
###784 And post it as a video response here on this page.
###788 The Spangler effect.
###789 All right.
###790 Let's take everything that we learned, and turn this into a
###793 segment with the meteorologist Becky Ditchfield.
###795 She's very, very gullible.
###797 I could probably convince her that this disappearing ink is
###800 actually a biological stain.
###802 And maybe we can have a little surprise
###804 ending for her as well.
###805 
###810 BECKY DITCHFIELD: So we're going in for a Steve Spangler
###812 science experiment.
###813 And, unlike a lot of other times, I have no idea what's
###815 going to happen.
###816 So, this is going to be interesting today.
###818 STEVE SPANGLER: So today we're talking chemistry.
###820 And this is a biological stain.
###823 OK?
###823 BECKY DITCHFIELD: What does that mean?
###824 STEVE SPANGLER: It's not.
###826 This is an ink.
###826 BECKY DITCHFIELD: Oh, OK.
###827 STEVE SPANGLER: So, see--
###827 Yeah.
###828 So here is, see the ink that's here?
###829 BECKY DITCHFIELD: Yeah.
###829 STEVE SPANGLER: It's this blue little ink.
###831 BECKY DITCHFIELD: Right.
###831 STEVE SPANGLER: It's hard to see it here,
###832 so here watch this.
###833 If I just--
###834 See?
###834 BECKY DITCHFIELD: Are you?
###835 Ah There you go.
###835 Isn't that beautiful?
###836 So this is-- isn't that great?
###838 Ah, this is gorgeous.
###840 It doesn't really leak through too much.
###841 But it's-- isn't this great?
###843 This is--
###844 BECKY DITCHFIELD: Oh, no.
###845 STEVE SPANGLER: It's fine.
###845 It's just a stronger--
###846 BECKY DITCHFIELD: Oh, my God.
###847 STEVE SPANGLER: See, this is a stronger source of--
###850 see how fast--
###851 see how it changes back just like this?
###853 BECKY DITCHFIELD: Yeah, that's really--
###855 STEVE SPANGLER: See, it's changing back.
###855 BECKY DITCHFIELD: Wow.
###856 STEVE SPANGLER: Yeah, Let's see on your back.
###859 You are--
###860 it's fine now.
###861 BECKY DITCHFIELD: No.
###862 STEVE SPANGLER: See, isn't that great?
###863 BECKY DITCHFIELD: Ah, now I know why you had that covered
###865 up, Steve Spangler.
###867 STEVE SPANGLER: This is another source-- and I just
###869 want people to know that this is carbon dioxide fire
###871 extinguisher.
###872 And look, you are completely back to normal, minus just a
###875 small amount of snow.
###876 So you're fine.
###877 You're fine.
###877 BECKY DITCHFIELD: Uh-huh.
###878 STEVE SPANGLER: See, isn't that great?
###880 This is why I use Becky.
###881 Here she is fantastic.
###882 But look.
###883 This is what most people don't realize.
###884 Fire extinguishers will produce a small amount of that
###888 condensation.
###888 And so she is kind of cold.
###890 BECKY DITCHFIELD: Freezing.
###891 I thought--
###892 STEVE SPANGLER: See how that works?
###893 BECKY DITCHFIELD: I'm afraid to touch this coat.
###895 STEVE SPANGLER: You're OK.
###895 Take off your little microphone.

###899 She is perfectly fine.
