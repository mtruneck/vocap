###12 ALEX MILLER: This is me asleep on a plane,
###14 dreaming of being a killer.
###16 I'm heading to Ardnamurchan, the most westerly point of
###19 mainland Britain.
###20 A place filled with little more than
###21 seagulls, sheep, and deer.
###24 I've booked a week in the hunting lodge of Ardnamurchan
###27 Estate, a huge expanse of mountainous land where deer
###30 stalking is still a way of life.
###32 Here, for a little more than 200 quid you can stalk and
###35 butcher your own Highland deer.
###37 I'm a lifelong supermarket carnivore, but soft as I am, I
###40 wanted to see, taste, and feel the death behind my dinner.
###44 It was a long trip.
###45 And the roads were dark and confusing.
###47 We were going to one of the most isolated places in
###49 Britain with no idea what was waiting for us.
###52 Would there be a blue-faced "Deliverance" tribe dressing
###54 in the skin of outsiders?
###55 Or just a small group of old women huddling around a pillow
###58 box and discussing heather?
###60 I'm a little bit worried that I'm not going to fit.
###61 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###69 ALEX MILLER: Deer stalking is the most traditional form of
###71 hunting in the world, as the practice has remained
###74 practically unchanged since the English aristocracy
###76 introduced it in the 1850s.
###79 It might seem quite primeval, but stalking a deer looks
###82 practically vegetarian compared to more common types
###84 of food production.
###85 We've all heard that intensive farming is melting the planet.
###88 The battery chickens are terribly depressed and ill
###90 educated and that every child born since 1987 thinks meat is
###94 grown in freezer aisles.
###97 But it's not all like that.
###98 In the highlands of Scotland, the
###99 hunter-gatherer is still king.
###103 So it's there that I'm going to live, kill, and feast with
###107 the last remaining indigenous tribe in Britain.
###109 
###114 Is that the kind of thing we trek on?
###117 The knife coming up from the ground?
###120 It's completely sheer.
###121 Look at that.
###124 Surely deer can't live in that?
###126 I can't live in that.
###128 There's no way I'm going to be able to survive if you put me
###131 there for five minutes.
###132 We're going to go and stalk some deer in the
###134 next couple of days.
###136 Do that.
###137 Do you not fancy my chances?
###140 -If you never shot a rifle before, no chance.
###142 ALEX MILLER: What you on about?
###144 He's telling us that we haven't got a chance of
###146 getting a deer.
###147 -In Ardnamurchan?
###148 ALEX MILLER: We're going to go stalking.
###148 -No chance.
###149 In Ardnamurchan?
###150 ALEX MILLER: Yeah.
###150 -Oh, you'll get a deer.
###151 ALEX MILLER: Yeah.
###152 -Ah, but it depends if he's a good shot or not.
###154 ALEX MILLER: Do you think I look like a good shot?
###156 -No.
###156 -No.
###156 ALEX MILLER: I mean I'm not--
###159 After traveling for 15 hours, losing ourselves in the
###161 thundering roads, we arrived.
###165 We were greeted with nothing but darkness.
###167 
###173 Wow.
###175 This has got murder written all over it.
###180 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###187 ALEX MILLER: When the morning came the darkness had gone,
###190 exposing this incredible landscape and the hunting
###193 lodge we were staying in.
###195 For a mere lodge, it looked an awful lot like a castle.
###197 
###200 Donald Houston, the owner of the estate, came
###202 to welcome us in.
###203 DONALD HOUSTON: The reality of living up here in the
###206 isolation is something that most people can't cope with.
###209 The nearest supermarket is two hours away.
###211 The nearest cinema's two hours away,
###213 there's absolutely nothing.
###214 ALEX MILLER: Do you find that all the people that come have
###216 the kind of right sense of respect for the--
###220 DONALD HOUSTON: Some do, some don't.
###221 There are a number of people and, I suppose, an increasing
###224 number of people who get a list of all the animals they
###228 want to shoot worldwide, and then it's just ticking a box.
###230 So on occasion we have had people that fly in in the
###233 morning, shoot an animal, fly back out in the afternoon.
###235 ALEX MILLER: Do you find that kind of approach a bit
###236 distasteful?
###238 DONALD HOUSTON: Yeah, yes.
###239 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###245 ALEX MILLER: I'm from Camden.
###246 And while street crime may be growing sport down south, I've
###249 never actually held a gun before.
###251 To train us up as marksman, Alistair McLoughlin--
###253 otherwise known as Titch-- the local fisherman and sometimes
###256 poacher took us into an extinct
###257 volcano hunting for woodcock.
###259 This would be the first baby step on my journey towards
###262 becoming a hunter.
###263 I'm locked in.
###265 I'm so un-countryside.
###266 I'm locked in.
###267 ALISTAIR MCLOUGHLIN: Well, this shotgun here's a 12 bolt.
###270 Be careful, don't put any bigger shells in it or you
###272 could end up with an explosion on your hands.
###274 Aye, they're good enough guns.
###275 Do the job.
###278 ALEX MILLER: Carrying the shotguns, we started
###280 to feel like men.
###281 Like seasoned hunters, like killers with
###284 nature at our mercy.
###285 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###292 ALEX MILLER: When Titch worked out how lame we were he made
###294 us practice on some clay pigeon.
###296 ALISTAIR MCLOUGHLIN: Get ready with that safety now.
###298 ALEX MILLER: All right, yeah.
###299 ALISTAIR MCLOUGHLIN: Now that's on.
###300 Now don't touch the trigger once you push it forward.
###302 ALEX MILLER: All right.
###303 ALISTAIR MCLOUGHLIN: You ready?
###304 ALEX MILLER: Go ahead.
###307 Hey.
###308 ALISTAIR MCLOUGHLIN: First shot, first bullet.
###309 ALEX MILLER: Oh, that's my ears ringing.
###312 Very good at this though, a very good marksman.
###313 
###318 Oh well, magic doesn't strike twice.
###322 ALISTAIR MCLOUGHLIN: No, this one here.
###323 Just push if forward and you're ready to take the shot.
###325 ANDY CAPPER: OK.
###326 We got a grip.
###327 ALISTAIR MCLOUGHLIN: OK, you got a good, tight
###328 grip in your shoulder?
###329 ANDY CAPPER: Yeah.
###330 ALISTAIR MCLOUGHLIN: You ready?
###331 
###340 OK?
###342 
###344 ANDY CAPPER: Swap.
###345 ALEX MILLER: It's all in preparation for him taking us
###347 out to shoot some actual real birds.
###349 I can't remember what kind of birds we're going to shoot.
###351 -Woodcock.
###351 ALEX MILLER: We're going to go shoot woodcock.
###352 ALISTAIR MCLOUGHLIN: Ready?
###353 ANDY CAPPER: Yep.
###354 ALEX MILLER: Which I'm pretty hyped and ready.
###355 I got bloodlust, I got gun lust.
###357 I got mine first time.
###360 I was like Terminator.
###361 ALISTAIR MCLOUGHLIN: The deal is, from this point is you two
###363 are going to be to on either side in a minute.
###365 And we're going to go in through the trees here, and up
###367 and around.
###368 And any woodcock that jumps out, I'll show
###370 it to you is woodcock.
###371 But wait for them to be high.
###372 And the most important thing is don't shoot the dogs.
###374 ALEX MILLER: All right.
###375 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###380 ALEX MILLER: It's really, really windy.
###383 You can barely walk forwards.
###385 Even if there was a woodcock I'm pretty sure I couldn't
###387 open my eyes to get it, this stupid country.
###390 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###402 ALEX MILLER: Ah, Andy got one.
###404 I'm amazed.
###405 ANDY CAPPER: Hit the first shot, I see a bit of feather.
###408 Second shot, I see something go around the corner.
###411 But I don't know if I've got it or not.
###413 Well, I feel bad for the family.
###416 ALEX MILLER: We couldn't find Andy's bird and it
###418 was windy as hell.
###419 But I had a gun.
###421 So I started shooting the shit out of the river and the sky
###426 just to show mother nature who was boss.
###429 I was developing the cocky strut of a killer.
###431 
###440 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###451 ALEX MILLER: If I'm honest, I've been trying not to think
###454 about doing this for about the last three weeks.
###457 There's something a bit distasteful about being the
###461 young go-getting media type from the city, flies off and
###464 slaughters beautiful creatures for a documentary.
###468 Last night I had some pretty unsubtle dreams.
###472 I was lying in a bed and someone had cut a square into
###476 my stomach and ripped organs out of me, which are two
###480 things that I pretty much have to do to this deer today.
###483 We're going to go and meet the head stalker, Niall Rowntree.
###486 Don't know that much about him.
###487 But we know that every day he gets up early in the morning,
###491 loads his rifle, and goes and kills deer.
###494 So he should probably be able to deliver what we want.
###497 
###500 Yeah, you can tell a man's serious about death when he
###504 keeps the carcasses up on the wall.
###508 We don't get to shoot a stag because it's the wrong time of
###511 the season.
###511 We're going to shoot a woman.
###513 Which is, for some reason, darker.
###516 NIALL ROWENTREE: And what you want to do today when we're
###518 out is any instructions you get, for your own safety in
###521 particular, follow them in detail.
###524 And if we're approaching deer you want to be in
###526 single file behind me.
###528 Avoid fast movements.
###530 Avoid the classic thing everybody does, and you can
###532 watch this.
###533 Is when you're out stalking up on deer, very often people
###536 will do that to see what you're looking at.
###538 And because they're programmed on movement, If you stick your
###541 head around the corner of a hill or a skyline they'll see
###543 it quite easily and they'll take off.
###547 Their sense of preservation is better than ours.
###549 ALEX MILLER: How close are we able to get?
###552 NIALL ROWENTREE: We'll ideally aim to be about 100 metres.
###554 ALEX MILLER: OK.
###555 If you do get a good shot in how long does it take before
###557 the animal dies?
###557 NIALL ROWENTREE: If you hit it properly with your instructor
###559 to shoot it today the animal will die instantly.
###561 It'll collapse in front of you.
###563 And that'll be it.
###563 ALEX MILLER: Before I was allowed to take a life I had
###566 to pass a shooting test.
###567 If I missed the target more than once in four shots I
###570 wouldn't be allowed to do it.
###572 This was to make sure I wouldn't mess it up, blow an
###574 eye out, and leave a disabled deer to
###576 slowly down on the mountain.
###578 Slowly, methodically, Niall took me through
###580 the shooting process.
###582 Three times out of four I nailed the target.
###584 
###588 And so I was clear to hunt.
###590 NIALL ROWENTREE: That's smack in the middle of the
###591 red plate this time.
###592 ALEX MILLER: Sweet.
###594 On the way to the store we paused to feed some stag.
###598 I guess that was some cruel perch on Niall's behalf.
###600 Because once hundreds of these amazing animals have lept over
###603 the landscape to be fed by you, you realize what a
###605 beautiful thing you're killing.
###607 NIALL ROWENTREE: They've been my whole life all my life.
###609 I mean I can remember going to see deer since I was a tiny
###612 little boy.
###613 And I've been fascinated with them since day one.
###615 For what we sell as a product to foreign visitors we would
###620 probably cull that old stag this coming year.
###623 That stag-- to give you an idea-- is worth about a
###625 thousand pounds to us to a client.
###626 But he's cheekier than he ought to be.
###628 You see the head tilting down at you there?
###630 But if you stare at him too much he bottles it.
###632 They don't like being stared at.
###635 ALEX MILLER: Do they ever attack humans ever?
###637 NIALL ROWENTREE: My father was very badly mauled by one when
###641 I was a kid, but it was a park stag.
###644 If they lose their fear of man they become dangerous.
###646 He was quite badly lacerated with him.
###648 He was struck in the head and then two or three
###649 times in the body.
###652 Yeah, I think if I hadn't shot the stag when it was attacking
###654 him it might've killed him.
###656 ALEX MILLER: You shot the stag when it was attacking him?
###657 NIALL ROWENTREE: Yeah.
###658 ALEX MILLER: You saved your dad's life?
###659 NIALL ROWENTREE: Yes.
###661 ALEX MILLER: That's a pretty cool thing to be able to do
###663 when you're 13.
###664 NIALL ROWENTREE: You do your best.
###664 ALEX MILLER: A good one to have over your
###665 old man, isn't it?
###667 So we've actually just been this close to deer, beautiful,
###671 beautiful stags.
###674 Which is a lovely experience, only we're on our way to kill
###676 their girlfriends.
###677 With any luck, one of the female deers will attack us
###679 and I'll have to shoot her out of an act of charity.
###683 Deer stalking is centuries old, one of the most
###685 traditional forms of hunting in the world.
###687 And the vast majority of venison is still
###689 produced this way.
###691 The deer are culled in order to promote the health of the
###693 land and the ecosystem.
###696 The stalker's prey is chosen specifically.
###698 Once it's been shot, the carcass is butchered locally
###701 and exported as organic free-range meat.
###703 The process is a large part of a local economy short of many
###706 other options.
###707 Tourists like me-- we were continually assured--
###710 only help to keep this part of the world
###712 from becoming a desert.
###713 So remember, getting these pretty things is dead ethical.
###716 NIALL ROWENTREE: We'll try and whisper to one another.
###718 But once we get really close we might not be able to speak.
###720 It might just be hand signals.
###721 So if you're happy--
###723 quite simple-- thumbs up.
###724 You're not so happy, nod your head, shake your head.
###728 Exactly like that.
###730 If you burst into tears I'll know you're not
###731 feeling up for it.
###733 -Where's the nearest hospital?
###734 NIALL ROWENTREE: Fort William.
###735 -How far away is that?
###736 NIALL ROWENTREE: That's about 70 miles away.
###737 ALEX MILLER: Good, good.
###739 
###742 Is this kind of the normal steepness that we'll be
###748 dealing with?
###749 NIALL ROWENTREE: Yes.
###749 This is going from sea level to nearly 1800 feet.
###752 How heavy is this thing?
###754 The biggest stag we shot here last season in 2008
###757 was 24 stone 1.
###759 ALEX MILLER: So I mean, when you were dragging them back do
###762 we let gravity do most of the work?
###763 NIALL ROWENTREE: No.
###764 ALEX MILLER: No?
###764 You let us do the work?
###766 NIALL ROWENTREE: Yeah, you'll do the work.
###766 ALEX MILLER: Oh good.
###768 We haven't gone that far, still really quite exhausting.
###773 NIALL ROWENTREE: How old are you?
###774 ALEX MILLER: I'm 25.
###775 NIALL ROWENTREE: Embarrassing.
###776 ALEX MILLER: How old are you?
###777 NIALL ROWENTREE: 44.
###781 ALEX MILLER: We've just climbed up some of the
###783 steepest stuff I've ever walked up for about an hour.
###787 It's pretty tiring.
###788 The view's absolutely incredible.
###790 But Niall's just told us that he's spotted the deer just
###794 over the ridge there.
###796 As he puts it, the game is on.
###798 Which means it's going to be quite quiet and single file
###800 from now on.
###801 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###814 NIALL ROWENTREE: The idea is to disturb them
###816 as little as possible.
###818 So once you've shot, you don't move.
###822 And if everything goes according to plan, the animal
###824 will drop where it's shot, and the others will look around to
###827 try and figure out what's happened, and then quietly
###829 drift away.
###831 The main group is only 80 meters away.
###838 ALEX MILLER: Suddenly, Niall dropped to his knees.
###842 We all followed him, and crawled through icy mud for
###844 about 30 meters, until we reached a
###846 mound, my grassy knoll.
###849 
###852 We stayed frozen for at least 30 minutes while Niall chose
###855 our victim.
###856 
###858 Eventually he beckoned.
###860 I crawled alongside him and he pointed out which deer I was
###863 going to shoot.
###864 
###872 NIALL ROWENTREE: Now's the time.
###874 [GUNSHOT]
###875 ALEX MILLER: Oh wow.
###878 NIALL ROWENTREE: Don't move, don't move, don't move.
###880 It's well hit, it's well hit.
###884 OK?
###884 Just wait.
###885 Just let them come.
###886 Now reload your rifle, please.
###887 Pull it back, straight forward.
###891 Safety off and wait for instructions.
###892 See the animal falling?
###894 Down she goes.
###896 And it's over.
###897 Safety on, finger off.
