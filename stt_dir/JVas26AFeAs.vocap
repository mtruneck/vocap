###12 SHANE SMITH: So after traveling across Siberia on
###14 one train, deep into the middle of nowhere, we switched
###17 to another train going even deeper into
###20 the middle of nowhere.
###21 And finally, after two and a half very drunken days on the
###24 train, we arrived in Tynda, where the North Korean
###27 administrative camp was.
###28 
###36 So we just got to Tynda.
###39 Some say it's the worst town in all of Russia--
###43 the most depressing.
###44 And we're actually going to try to go to the office that
###48 runs all the North Koreans in the region and see if we can
###51 ask them some questions.
###53 
###59 We met this cop on the train.
###61 He seemed liked a nice guy.
###63 He got the thugs away from us when things got a bit drunk-y.
###67 And so then he's offered to help us, which is good.
###70 Because when we went to the hotel to check in, we
###72 didn't check in.
###73 Why?
###73 Because the FSB, who used to be the KGB, are asking about
###78 us, saying, let us know when they check in.
###81 So the lady said, I'll let them know, but I'm letting you
###83 know that I'm letting them know.
###85 So we're like, OK, we won't be staying there.
###87 So we stayed in an apartment where the water
###90 smelled like gasoline.
###91 And now we have a cop that we're going to bring with us,
###94 so we seem more official when we go meet the North Koreans.
###97 
###111 We just got here, and we see posters
###113 of Kim Il-Sung already.
###115 And also it says here that they will lay their lives down
###118 for the revolution of the great leader, Kim Jong-Il.
###123 What are we waiting for, by the way?
###124 SIMON OSTROVSKY: For one of the bosses of the camp.
###126 SHANE SMITH: Look, he's got, like, a Kim Il-Sung pin and
###129 everything.
###131 SIMON OSTROVSKY: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###133 MALE SPEAKER 1: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###135 SIMON OSTROVSKY: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###138 MALE SPEAKER 1: Hi.
###139 SIMON OSTROVSKY: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###145 MALE SPEAKER 1: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###146 SIMON OSTROVSKY: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]

###200 MALE SPEAKER 1: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]

###205 MALE SPEAKER 1: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###206 
###213 SHANE SMITH: So the North Koreans don't want us to go
###215 into the North Korean camp?
###216 SIMON OSTROVSKY: They don't want to go into the north
###217 Korean camp.
###218 SHANE SMITH: That's very surprising.
###219 
###224 So we came out here to the outskirts of Tynda and we
###228 found the North Korean
###229 Administration Camp Number Two.
###231 Surprise, surprise, they won't let us in.
###233 But we're going to go deeper into the interior to find the
###236 actual work camps and see if we can talk
###238 to some of the dudes.
###240 
###243 So we're leaving on a one-car train to go to the north
###247 Korean camps.
###248 It's a one-car train.
###249 That goes into the middle of nowhere.
###251 [TRAIN WHISTLE]
###255 
###265 SHANE SMITH: So this is our chief of police, and he's
###267 breaking in to the North Korean camp.
###271 Oh shit, We're literally getting caught
###274 looting right now.
###275 SIMON OSTROVSKY: We should get the vodka.
