0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:16,78



2
0:0:16,78 --> 0:0:17,99
SNOOP DOGG: What up, dog?


3
0:0:17,99 --> 0:0:21,48
My name is big Snoop, D-O double
G. And this is the


4
0:0:21,48 --> 0:0:25,3
craziest story I can remember
from way back in the day.


5
0:0:25,3 --> 0:0:27,86
I remember going to a party
at the Playboy mansion.


6
0:0:27,86 --> 0:0:32,79
I had on a blue smoker's jacket,
Playboy mansion, boo,


7
0:0:32,79 --> 0:0:37,7
and had a big ol' pimp cup,
real big, about a half a


8
0:0:37,7 --> 0:0:39,69
gallon of champagne, a gallon
of orange juice-- you know


9
0:0:39,69 --> 0:0:42,47
what I'm saying?-- to level
it off, walking


10
0:0:42,47 --> 0:0:44,69
around, me and Bishop.


11
0:0:44,69 --> 0:0:46,12
And one of the bunnies says,
Snoop, can I have


12
0:0:46,12 --> 0:0:47,51
some of your drink?


13
0:0:47,51 --> 0:0:47,92
I say, yeah.


14
0:0:47,92 --> 0:0:48,7
Go ahead, baby.


15
0:0:48,7 --> 0:0:51,9
So she grabbed it
and took a sip.


16
0:0:51,9 --> 0:0:53,3
Gave it to her friend and
let her have a sip.


17
0:0:53,3 --> 0:0:54,61
And they passed it around.


18
0:0:54,61 --> 0:0:58,18
And I turned my head and
turned back around.


19
0:0:58,18 --> 0:0:59,43
They gave me my glass.


20
0:0:59,43 --> 0:1:0,94
I started drinking.


21
0:1:0,94 --> 0:1:3,86
And as I'm drinking, boom,
I'm starting to


22
0:1:3,86 --> 0:1:5,66
feel a little different.


23
0:1:5,66 --> 0:1:8,52
So I start to walk and
get a little queasy.


24
0:1:8,52 --> 0:1:9,86
And there's nowhere to sit.


25
0:1:9,86 --> 0:1:12,34
So I finally find some
room or a door.


26
0:1:12,34 --> 0:1:14,13
And I kick through the door.


27
0:1:14,13 --> 0:1:16,28
And when I go through
the door, it's like


28
0:1:16,28 --> 0:1:18,6
16 flights of steps.


29
0:1:18,6 --> 0:1:21,76
And I fall down all of the steps
straight to the bottom,


30
0:1:21,76 --> 0:1:22,486
to the floor.


31
0:1:22,486 --> 0:1:23,716
Boom.


32
0:1:23,716 --> 0:1:27,29
With a couple of white girls
running down the stairs.


33
0:1:27,29 --> 0:1:29,22
They start pouring
water on my neck.


34
0:1:29,22 --> 0:1:32,5
And I heard Bishop Magic Juan
say, the church is down.


35
0:1:32,5 --> 0:1:33,17
Call the ambulance.


36
0:1:33,17 --> 0:1:35,17
The church is down.


37
0:1:35,17 --> 0:1:37,295
So the girls get me
to a point where I


38
0:1:37,295 --> 0:1:39,8
finally, like, wake up.


39
0:1:39,8 --> 0:1:41,75
And they like, someone slipped
a roofie on you.


40
0:1:41,75 --> 0:1:44,36
So I get back and walk back
through the party.


41
0:1:44,36 --> 0:1:46,5
I'm like, you know what?


42
0:1:46,5 --> 0:1:47,94
I can't leave the
party like this.


43
0:1:47,94 --> 0:1:51,6
And now I start smoking
weed with everybody.


44
0:1:51,6 --> 0:1:53,59
And I go into this
little grotto.


45
0:1:53,59 --> 0:1:56,1
And there's a couple of Playboy
bunnies in there.


46
0:1:56,1 --> 0:1:58,86
And I says, my dick is on
the line right now.


47
0:1:58,86 --> 0:2:1,79
I gave the bunnies more
than they can handle.


48
0:2:1,79 --> 0:2:2,82
I gave 'em a treat.


49
0:2:2,82 --> 0:2:5,55
And it wasn't no carrot stick.


50
0:2:5,55 --> 0:2:9,27
It was a pogo stick, if
you dig what I mean.


51
0:2:9,27 --> 0:2:10,93
Up and down it go.


52
0:2:10,93 --> 0:2:13,425
It was official like a referee
with a whistle.


53
0:2:13,425 --> 0:2:15,42
A star was born.


54
0:2:15,42 --> 0:4:15,42
