1
0:0:3,47 --> 0:0:3,53
0:00:03.066,0:00:08.033


2
0:0:3,53 --> 0:0:6,1
We want to pass on a country that’s safe


3
0:0:6,1 --> 0:0:8,559
and respected and admired around the


4
0:0:8,559 --> 0:0:9,9
world,


5
0:0:9,9 --> 0:0:9,62
0:00:09.066,0:00:16.033


6
0:0:9,62 --> 0:0:13,3
a nation that is defended by the strongest


7
0:0:13,3 --> 0:0:16,66
military on earth and the best troops this


8
0:0:16,66 --> 0:0:17,57
0:00:17.033,0:00:20.033


9
0:0:17,57 --> 0:0:21,119
this world has ever known


10
0:0:21,119 --> 0:0:22,89
0:00:24.033,0:00:29.066


11
0:0:22,89 --> 0:0:26,48
But also a country that moves with


12
0:0:26,48 --> 0:0:28,949
confidence beyond this time of war,


13
0:0:28,949 --> 0:0:29,21
0:00:29.066,0:00:34.000


14
0:0:29,21 --> 0:0:32,29
to shape a peace that is built on the promise


15
0:0:32,29 --> 0:0:34,23
of freedom and dignity for every human


16
0:0:34,23 --> 0:0:35,57
being.


17
0:0:35,57 --> 0:0:36,91
0:00:36.066,0:00:39.066


18
0:0:36,91 --> 0:0:39,44
We believe in a generous America,


19
0:0:39,44 --> 0:0:40,6
0:00:39.000,0:00:42.066


20
0:0:40,6 --> 0:0:42,1
in a compassionate America,


21
0:0:42,1 --> 0:0:43,11
0:00:42.033,0:00:44.000


22
0:0:43,11 --> 0:0:44,6
in a tolerant America,


23
0:0:44,6 --> 0:0:45,28
0:00:45.033,0:00:51.033


24
0:0:45,28 --> 0:0:47,6
open to the dreams of an immigrant’s


25
0:0:47,6 --> 0:0:49,72
daughter who studies in our schools and


26
0:0:49,72 --> 0:0:51,5
pledges to our flag.


27
0:0:51,5 --> 0:0:52,57
0:00:57.000,0:01:03.033


28
0:0:52,57 --> 0:0:59,56
To the young boy on the south side of


29
0:0:59,56 --> 0:1:2,54
Chicago who sees a life beyond the nearest


30
0:1:2,54 --> 0:1:6,509
street corner.


31
0:1:6,509 --> 0:1:8,51
0:01:08.033,0:01:16.066


32
0:1:8,51 --> 0:1:10,11
To the furniture worker’s child in North


33
0:1:10,11 --> 0:1:13,54
Carolina who wants to become a doctor or a


34
0:1:13,54 --> 0:1:15,83
scientist, an engineer or an entrepreneur


35
0:1:15,83 --> 0:1:16,44
0:01:17.066,0:01:19.000


36
0:1:16,44 --> 0:1:19,1
a diplomat or even a president


37
0:1:19,1 --> 0:1:21,94
0:01:20.033,0:01:22.066


38
0:1:21,94 --> 0:1:27,47
that’s the future we hope for.


39
0:1:27,47 --> 0:1:27,47
0:01:23.000,0:01:26.000


40
0:1:27,47 --> 0:1:27,47
That’s the vision we share.


41
0:1:27,47 --> 0:1:27,47
0:01:26.033,0:01:35.000


42
0:1:27,47 --> 0:1:31,68
That’s where we need to go — forward.


43
0:1:31,68 --> 0:1:39,229
That’s where we need to go.


44
0:1:39,229 --> 0:1:39,229
0:01:38.000,0:01:43.000


45
0:1:39,229 --> 0:1:42,7
Now, we will disagree, sometimes fiercely,


46
0:1:42,7 --> 0:1:44,9
about how to get there.


47
0:1:44,9 --> 0:1:45,7
0:01:45.066,0:01:52.000


48
0:1:45,7 --> 0:1:47,659
As it has for more than two centuries,


49
0:1:47,659 --> 0:1:50,89
progress will come in fits and starts. It’s
not


50
0:1:50,89 --> 0:1:52,49
always a straight line.


51
0:1:52,49 --> 0:1:52,549
0:01:52.000,0:01:54.066


52
0:1:52,549 --> 0:1:54,799
It’s not always a smooth path.


53
0:1:54,799 --> 0:1:56,2
0:01:56.033,0:02:01.033


54
0:1:56,2 --> 0:1:57,78
By itself, the recognition that we have


55
0:1:57,78 --> 0:2:0,17
common hopes and dreams won’t end all the


56
0:2:0,17 --> 0:2:0,659
gridlock


57
0:2:0,659 --> 0:2:1,189
0:02:01.033,0:02:07.033


58
0:2:1,189 --> 0:2:4,89
or solve all our problems or substitute for
the


59
0:2:4,89 --> 0:2:7,4
painstaking work of building consensus


60
0:2:7,4 --> 0:2:8,42
0:02:08.066,0:02:17.066


61
0:2:8,42 --> 0:2:10,78
and making the difficult compromises needed


62
0:2:10,78 --> 0:2:14,38
to move this country forward. But that


63
0:2:14,38 --> 0:2:18,59
common bond is where we must begin.


64
0:2:18,59 --> 0:2:19,88
0:02:19.000,0:02:21.033


65
0:2:19,88 --> 0:2:20,86
Our economy is recovering


66
0:2:20,86 --> 0:2:21,63
0:02:22.000,0:02:23.066


67
0:2:21,63 --> 0:2:24,93
A decade of war is ending.


68
0:2:24,93 --> 0:2:26,28
0:02:24.033,0:02:27.000


69
0:2:26,28 --> 0:2:34,38
A long campaign is now over.


70
0:2:34,38 --> 0:2:35,73
0:02:35.000,0:02:45.066


71
0:2:35,73 --> 0:2:39,99
And whether I earned your vote or not, I


72
0:2:39,99 --> 0:2:43,15
have listened to you, I have learned from
you,


73
0:2:43,15 --> 0:2:45,76
and you’ve made me a better president.


74
0:2:45,76 --> 0:2:46,64
0:02:46.000,0:02:53.066


75
0:2:46,64 --> 0:2:51,8
And with your stories and your struggles,
I


76
0:2:51,8 --> 0:2:52,95
return to the White House


77
0:2:52,95 --> 0:2:53,2
0:02:53.066,0:02:59.033


78
0:2:53,2 --> 0:2:55,91
more determined and more inspired than ever


79
0:2:55,91 --> 0:3:10,459
about the work there is to do and the future


80
0:3:10,459 --> 0:3:10,9
that lies ahead.


81
0:3:10,9 --> 0:3:11,5
0:03:09.033,0:03:14.000


82
0:3:11,5 --> 0:3:13,97
Tonight you voted for action, not politics
as


83
0:3:13,97 --> 0:3:13,97
usual.


84
0:3:13,97 --> 0:3:13,97
0:03:16.033,0:03:20.033


85
0:3:13,97 --> 0:3:19,91
You elected us to focus on your jobs, not


86
0:3:19,91 --> 0:3:20,73
ours.


87
0:3:20,73 --> 0:3:21,55
0:03:22.066,0:03:28.066


88
0:3:21,55 --> 0:3:24,849
And in the coming weeks and months, I am


89
0:3:24,849 --> 0:3:27,5
looking forward to reaching out and working


90
0:3:27,5 --> 0:3:28,81
with leaders of both parties


91
0:3:28,81 --> 0:3:29,51
0:03:28.066,0:03:32.066


92
0:3:29,51 --> 0:3:32,4
to meet the challenges we can only solve


93
0:3:32,4 --> 0:3:32,69
together.


94
0:3:32,69 --> 0:3:33,349
0:03:33.033,0:03:36.033


95
0:3:33,349 --> 0:3:36,54
Reducing our deficit. Reforming our tax code.


96
0:3:36,54 --> 0:3:36,91
0:03:36.033,0:03:44.033


97
0:3:36,91 --> 0:3:40,3
Fixing our immigration system. Freeing


98
0:3:40,3 --> 0:3:46,569
ourselves from foreign oil. We’ve got more


99
0:3:46,569 --> 0:3:49,37
work to do.


100
0:3:49,37 --> 0:3:50,31
0:03:50.066,0:03:53.066


101
0:3:50,31 --> 0:3:54,209
But that doesn’t mean your work is done.


102
0:3:54,209 --> 0:3:55,39
0:03:55.033,0:04:00.033


103
0:3:55,39 --> 0:3:58,75
The role of citizen in our democracy does
not


104
0:3:58,75 --> 0:4:0,739
end with your vote.


105
0:4:0,739 --> 0:4:1,81
0:04:02.033,0:04:04.000


106
0:4:1,81 --> 0:4:3,9
America’s never been about what can be


107
0:4:3,9 --> 0:4:4,599
done for us.


108
0:4:4,599 --> 0:4:4,67
0:04:04.000,0:04:09.000


109
0:4:4,67 --> 0:4:7,43
It’s about what can be done by us together


110
0:4:7,43 --> 0:4:11,19
through the hard and frustrating,


111
0:4:11,19 --> 0:4:11,739
0:04:09.000,0:04:13.000


112
0:4:11,739 --> 0:4:15,34
but necessary work of self-government.


113
0:4:15,34 --> 0:4:16,6
0:04:14.000,0:04:18.000


114
0:4:16,6 --> 0:4:21,1
That’s the principle we were founded on.


115
0:4:21,1 --> 0:4:21,81
0:04:21.066,0:04:26.066


116
0:4:21,81 --> 0:4:23,59
This country has more wealth than any


117
0:4:23,59 --> 0:4:27,9
nation, but that’s not what makes us rich.


118
0:4:27,9 --> 0:4:28,9
0:04:27.066,0:04:31.066


119
0:4:28,9 --> 0:4:30,8
We have the most powerful military in history,


120
0:4:30,8 --> 0:4:32,3
but that’s not what makes us strong.


121
0:4:32,3 --> 0:4:33,25
0:04:33.033,0:04:41.000


122
0:4:33,25 --> 0:4:37,47
Our university, our culture are all the envy
of


123
0:4:37,47 --> 0:4:39,78
the world, but that’s not what keeps the


124
0:4:39,78 --> 0:4:41,9
world coming to our shores.


125
0:4:41,9 --> 0:4:43,12
0:04:43.066,0:04:49.000


126
0:4:43,12 --> 0:4:44,91
What makes America exceptional are the


127
0:4:44,91 --> 0:4:47,81
bonds that hold together the most diverse


128
0:4:47,81 --> 0:4:49,1
nation on earth.


129
0:4:49,1 --> 0:4:49,72
0:04:49.000,0:04:53.000


130
0:4:49,72 --> 0:4:52,66
The belief that our destiny is shared; that
this


131
0:4:52,66 --> 0:4:54,16
country only works


132
0:4:54,16 --> 0:4:54,75
0:04:53.000,0:04:59.066


133
0:4:54,75 --> 0:4:57,18
when we accept certain obligations to one


134
0:4:57,18 --> 0:4:59,5
another and to future generations.


135
0:4:59,5 --> 0:4:59,65
0:04:59.066,0:05:08.033


136
0:4:59,65 --> 0:5:2,33
The freedom which so many Americans have


137
0:5:2,33 --> 0:5:4,99
fought for and died for come with


138
0:5:4,99 --> 0:5:7,22
responsibilities as well as rights.


139
0:5:7,22 --> 0:5:7,669
0:05:08.033,0:05:13.000


140
0:5:7,669 --> 0:5:11,33
And among those are love and charity and


141
0:5:11,33 --> 0:5:14,44
duty and patriotism.


142
0:5:14,44 --> 0:5:16,63
0:05:13.000,0:05:17.000


143
0:5:16,63 --> 0:5:27,58
That’s what makes America great


144
0:5:27,58 --> 0:5:29,77
0:05:29.066,0:05:34.066


145
0:5:29,77 --> 0:5:32,979
I am hopeful tonight because I’ve seen the


146
0:5:32,979 --> 0:5:34,9
spirit at work in America.


147
0:5:34,9 --> 0:5:35,84
0:05:36.066,0:05:42.033


148
0:5:35,84 --> 0:5:38,74
I’ve seen it in the family business whose


149
0:5:38,74 --> 0:5:41,33
owners would rather cut their own pay than


150
0:5:41,33 --> 0:5:41,88
lay off their neighbors,


151
0:5:41,88 --> 0:5:42,9
0:05:43.000,0:05:47.000


152
0:5:42,9 --> 0:5:44,85
and in the workers who would rather cut


153
0:5:44,85 --> 0:5:49,639
back their hours than see a friend lose a
job.


154
0:5:49,639 --> 0:5:49,639
0:05:49.033,0:05:57.066


155
0:5:49,639 --> 0:5:52,639
I’ve seen it in the soldiers who reenlist
after


156
0:5:52,639 --> 0:5:55,99
losing a limb and in those SEALs who


157
0:5:55,99 --> 0:5:58,4
charged up the stairs into darkness


158
0:5:58,4 --> 0:5:58,4
0:05:57.066,0:06:01.066


159
0:5:58,4 --> 0:5:59,81
and danger because they knew there was a


160
0:5:59,81 --> 0:6:3,979
buddy behind them watching their back.


161
0:6:3,979 --> 0:6:5,479
0:06:09.000,0:06:12.000


162
0:6:5,479 --> 0:6:11,639
I’ve seen it on the shores of New Jersey
and


163
0:6:11,639 --> 0:6:12,229
New York,


164
0:6:12,229 --> 0:6:12,669
0:06:12.033,0:06:17.033


165
0:6:12,669 --> 0:6:15,15
where leaders from every party and level of


166
0:6:15,15 --> 0:6:17,39
government have swept aside their


167
0:6:17,39 --> 0:6:17,669
differences


168
0:6:17,669 --> 0:6:18,9
0:06:17.033,0:06:21.033


169
0:6:18,9 --> 0:6:20,32
to help a community rebuild from the


170
0:6:20,32 --> 0:6:26,169
wreckage of a terrible storm.


171
0:6:26,169 --> 0:6:30,78
0:06:30.066,0:06:39.033


172
0:6:30,78 --> 0:6:34,86
And I saw just the other day, in Mentor, Ohio,


173
0:6:34,86 --> 0:6:38,24
where a father told the story of his 8-year-


174
0:6:38,24 --> 0:6:39,75
old daughter,


175
0:6:39,75 --> 0:6:40,82
0:06:40.000,0:06:48.066


176
0:6:40,82 --> 0:6:44,0
whose long battle with leukemia nearly cost


177
0:6:44,0 --> 0:6:47,75
their family everything had it not been for


178
0:6:47,75 --> 0:6:48,88
health care reform


179
0:6:48,88 --> 0:6:48,88
0:06:48.066,0:06:53.000


180
0:6:48,88 --> 0:6:52,82
passing just a few months before the


181
0:6:52,82 --> 0:7:3,34
insurance company was about to stop


182
0:7:3,34 --> 0:7:3,66
paying for her care.


183
0:7:3,66 --> 0:7:3,729
0:07:02.066,0:07:10.000


184
0:7:3,729 --> 0:7:4,9
I had an opportunity to not just talk to the


185
0:7:4,9 --> 0:7:9,819
father, but meet this incredible daughter
of


186
0:7:9,819 --> 0:7:10,789
his.


187
0:7:10,789 --> 0:7:11,77
0:07:11.000,0:07:20.000


188
0:7:11,77 --> 0:7:14,229
And when he spoke to the crowd listening to


189
0:7:14,229 --> 0:7:19,9
that father’s story, every parent in that
room


190
0:7:19,9 --> 0:7:20,85
had tears in their eyes,


191
0:7:20,85 --> 0:7:21,759
0:07:21.033,0:07:32.000


192
0:7:21,759 --> 0:7:25,77
because we knew that little girl could be
our


193
0:7:25,77 --> 0:7:29,91
own. And I know that every American wants


194
0:7:29,91 --> 0:7:32,61
her future to be just as bright.


195
0:7:32,61 --> 0:7:33,319
0:07:34.033,0:07:36.000


196
0:7:33,319 --> 0:7:35,59
That’s who we are.


197
0:7:35,59 --> 0:7:36,43
0:07:37.033,0:07:41.033


198
0:7:36,43 --> 0:7:39,449
That’s the country I’m so proud to lead
as


199
0:7:39,449 --> 0:7:42,56
your president.


200
0:7:42,56 --> 0:7:45,3
0:07:48.066,0:07:52.066


201
0:7:45,3 --> 0:7:52,41
And tonight, despite all the hardship we’ve


202
0:7:52,41 --> 0:7:53,27
been through,


203
0:7:53,27 --> 0:7:54,8
0:07:54.033,0:08:00.066


204
0:7:54,8 --> 0:7:58,55
despite all the frustrations of Washington,
I’ve


205
0:7:58,55 --> 0:8:0,22
never been more hopeful about our future


206
0:8:0,22 --> 0:8:0,83
0:08:02.000,0:08:06.000


207
0:8:0,83 --> 0:8:5,13
I have never been more hopeful about


208
0:8:5,13 --> 0:8:5,75
America.


209
0:8:5,75 --> 0:8:6,36
0:08:07.000,0:08:11.000


210
0:8:6,36 --> 0:8:9,77
And I ask you to sustain that hope.


211
0:8:9,77 --> 0:8:10,669
0:08:11.066,0:08:14.066


212
0:8:10,669 --> 0:8:13,449
I’m not talking about blind optimism,


213
0:8:13,449 --> 0:8:14,5
0:08:14.033,0:08:20.033


214
0:8:14,5 --> 0:8:16,55
the kind of hope that just ignores the


215
0:8:16,55 --> 0:8:19,39
enormity of the tasks ahead or the


216
0:8:19,39 --> 0:8:21,199
roadblocks that stand in our path.


217
0:8:21,199 --> 0:8:22,8
0:08:22.066,0:08:29.000


218
0:8:22,8 --> 0:8:25,3
I’m not talking about the wishful idealism
that


219
0:8:25,3 --> 0:8:28,389
allows us to just sit on the sidelines or
shirk


220
0:8:28,389 --> 0:8:29,919
from a fight.


221
0:8:29,919 --> 0:8:31,21
0:08:31.033,0:08:36.000


222
0:8:31,21 --> 0:8:33,509
I have always believed that hope is that


223
0:8:33,509 --> 0:8:35,869
stubborn thing inside us that insists,


224
0:8:35,869 --> 0:8:36,209
0:08:36.033,0:08:38.000


225
0:8:36,209 --> 0:8:38,19
despite all the evidence to the contrary,


226
0:8:38,19 --> 0:8:38,369
0:08:38.000,0:08:45.066


227
0:8:38,369 --> 0:8:41,9
that something better awaits us so long as


228
0:8:41,9 --> 0:8:43,369
we have the courage to keep reaching, to


229
0:8:43,369 --> 0:8:47,3
keep working, to keep fighting.


230
0:8:47,3 --> 0:8:49,569
0:08:51.033,0:08:54.033


231
0:8:49,569 --> 0:8:53,879
America, I believe we can build on the


232
0:8:53,879 --> 0:8:55,199
progress we’ve made


233
0:8:55,199 --> 0:8:55,619
0:08:55.000,0:09:01.033


234
0:8:55,619 --> 0:8:57,91
and continue to fight for new jobs and new


235
0:8:57,91 --> 0:9:0,779
opportunity and new security for the middle


236
0:9:0,779 --> 0:9:1,929
class.


237
0:9:1,929 --> 0:9:3,89
0:09:03.000,0:09:09.000


238
0:9:3,89 --> 0:9:5,239
I believe we can keep the promise of our


239
0:9:5,239 --> 0:9:8,17
founders, the idea that if you’re willing
to


240
0:9:8,17 --> 0:9:9,4
work hard,


241
0:9:9,4 --> 0:9:9,619
0:09:09.000,0:09:15.000


242
0:9:9,619 --> 0:9:11,839
it doesn’t matter who you are or where you


243
0:9:11,839 --> 0:9:14,92
come from or what you look like or where


244
0:9:14,92 --> 0:9:15,449
you love.


245
0:9:15,449 --> 0:9:15,709
0:09:15.000,0:09:17.066


246
0:9:15,709 --> 0:9:17,319
It doesn’t matter whether you’re black
or


247
0:9:17,319 --> 0:9:18,209
white or


248
0:9:18,209 --> 0:9:18,739
0:09:17.066,0:09:27.000


249
0:9:18,739 --> 0:9:22,48
Hispanic or Asian or Native American or


250
0:9:22,48 --> 0:9:27,279
young or old or rich or poor, able, disabled,


251
0:9:27,279 --> 0:9:28,879
gay or straight,


252
0:9:28,879 --> 0:9:29,42
0:09:27.000,0:09:31.000


253
0:9:29,42 --> 0:9:34,22
you can make it here in America if you’re


254
0:9:34,22 --> 0:9:35,829
willing to try.


255
0:9:35,829 --> 0:9:36,36
0:09:37.033,0:09:45.066


256
0:9:36,36 --> 0:9:39,929
I believe we can seize this future together


257
0:9:39,929 --> 0:9:44,949
because we are not as divided as our politics


258
0:9:44,949 --> 0:9:45,509
suggests.


259
0:9:45,509 --> 0:9:46,69
0:09:45.033,0:09:48.033


260
0:9:46,69 --> 0:9:48,999
We’re not as cynical as the pundits believe.


261
0:9:48,999 --> 0:9:49,69
0:09:48.033,0:09:52.033


262
0:9:49,69 --> 0:9:49,679
We are greater than the sum of our individual


263
0:9:49,679 --> 0:9:49,749
ambitions,


264
0:9:49,749 --> 0:9:49,819
0:09:52.033,0:09:57.000


265
0:9:49,819 --> 0:9:52,329
and we remain more than a collection of red


266
0:9:52,329 --> 0:9:53,139
states and blue states.


267
0:9:53,139 --> 0:9:53,189
0:09:57.000,0:10:01.000


268
0:9:53,189 --> 0:9:54,11
We are and forever will be the United States


269
0:9:54,11 --> 0:9:54,339
of America.


270
0:9:54,339 --> 0:9:54,459
0:10:01.000,0:10:10.000


271
0:9:54,459 --> 0:9:55,389
And together with your help and God’s grace


272
0:9:55,389 --> 0:9:56,199
we will continue our journey forward and


273
0:9:56,199 --> 0:9:56,8
remind the world just


274
0:9:56,8 --> 0:9:56,8
0:10:10.000,0:10:14.066


275
0:9:56,8 --> 0:10:2,749
why it is that we live in the greatest nation
on


276
0:10:2,749 --> 0:10:3,589
Earth


277
0:10:3,589 --> 0:10:4,429
0:10:14.066,0:10:20.066


278
0:10:4,429 --> 0:10:10,339
Thank you, America. God bless you. God


279
0:10:10,339 --> 0:12:10,339
bless these United States.
