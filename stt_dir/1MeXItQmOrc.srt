1
0:0:5,5 --> 0:0:7,24
In the Americas before Columbus


2
0:0:7,24 --> 0:0:19,23
fishing is not an industry.


3
0:0:19,23 --> 0:0:21,589
They don't need it.


4
0:0:21,589 --> 0:0:25,7
Fish are for the taking.


5
0:0:25,7 --> 0:0:34,95
Their rivers are not used for power and are not affected by farming.


6
0:0:34,95 --> 0:0:44,65
Native Americans transport their fish far away from the coasts and waterways.


7
0:0:44,65 --> 0:0:46,74
Into the interior


8
0:0:46,74 --> 0:0:49,45
high up into the mountains,


9
0:0:49,45 --> 0:0:51,41
the Inca, high in the Andes,


10
0:0:51,41 --> 0:0:55,83
enjoy fish from the Pacific.


11
0:0:55,83 --> 0:1:0,53
The Mississippians trade with communities as far away as the great lakes to the north,


12
0:1:0,53 --> 0:1:3,13
and the gulf coast to the south.


13
0:1:3,13 --> 0:1:10,39
They even eat fish and seafood from the Atlantic.


14
0:1:10,39 --> 0:1:16,32
Here too there's space for abundance.


15
0:1:16,32 --> 0:1:22,31
The waters teem with fish and with whales, dolphins


16
0:1:22,31 --> 0:1:52,6
and manatees.


17
0:1:52,6 --> 0:1:55,59
Wherever native Americans throw their nets


18
0:1:55,59 --> 0:2:1,23
they find a bounty of thousands of different species: menhaden


19
0:2:1,23 --> 0:2:3,1
channel catfish,


20
0:2:3,1 --> 0:2:7,29
and sheepshead.


21
0:2:7,29 --> 0:2:19,79
They never have to take more than nature can replace.


22
0:2:19,79 --> 0:2:20,469
North and South America


23
0:2:20,469 --> 0:2:37,369
appear to be a primitive untamed paradise.


24
0:2:37,369 --> 0:2:46,119
But looks can be deceiving.


25
0:2:46,119 --> 0:2:50,29
The greatest numbers of freshwater fish live in the Amazon,


26
0:2:50,29 --> 0:2:52,589
the largest river in the Americas.


27
0:2:52,589 --> 0:2:56,65
and the most voluminous in the world.


28
0:2:56,65 --> 0:3:3,9
To our eyes the Amazon rainforest is an almost untouched garden of Eden.


29
0:3:3,9 --> 0:3:10,839
But it was once a very different place than what we know today.


30
0:3:10,839 --> 0:3:14,669
When the jungle was cleared in the twentieth century for agricultural purposes,


31
0:3:14,669 --> 0:3:19,349
people found the remains of a sophisticated civilization


32
0:3:19,349 --> 0:3:23,699
that once managed this landscape.


33
0:3:23,699 --> 0:3:25,219
In 1491


34
0:3:25,219 --> 0:3:31,639
this area is home to thousands of people.


35
0:3:31,639 --> 0:3:36,839
They tend orchards with all kinds of fruits:


36
0:3:36,839 --> 0:3:38,759
papaya, mango


37
0:3:38,759 --> 0:3:48,209
cocoa, nuts and palms.


38
0:3:48,209 --> 0:3:50,729
They speak many different languages


39
0:3:50,729 --> 0:4:6,129
and live in many different social systems.


40
0:4:6,129 --> 0:4:13,219
Their tightly packed settlings cover an area of over forty-six thousand square miles.


41
0:4:13,219 --> 0:4:21,379
They are linked by raised causeways, bridges and canals.


42
0:4:21,379 --> 0:4:26,33
Much of this is natural savannah created by annual flooding,


43
0:4:26,33 --> 0:4:28,389
but they have expanded the grasslands,


44
0:4:28,389 --> 0:4:33,119
regularly setting huge areas on fire.


45
0:4:33,119 --> 0:4:35,169
By 1491


46
0:4:35,169 --> 0:4:39,629
they have created an ecosystem of plant species adapted by fire


47
0:4:39,629 --> 0:4:42,749
that cannot exist in Nature.


48
0:4:42,749 --> 0:4:51,569
Eventually the jungle will reclaim it.


49
0:4:51,569 --> 0:4:54,36
Further north, in what is now New Mexico,


50
0:4:54,36 --> 0:4:59,649
another grand civilization has already come and gone.


51
0:4:59,649 --> 0:5:6,599
It flourished in a place that today looks like no humans could never have lived there.


52
0:5:6,599 --> 0:5:10,869
The Chaco Canyon.


53
0:5:10,869 --> 0:5:13,68
There's almost no vegetation, no water


54
0:5:13,68 --> 0:5:16,339
and no animals to be seen.


55
0:5:16,339 --> 0:5:25,77
And it was already like this in 1491.


56
0:5:25,77 --> 0:5:26,72
But once


57
0:5:26,72 --> 0:5:30,74
this area looked completely different.


58
0:5:30,74 --> 0:5:36,11
This is the story of a civilization that developed as far as it could,


59
0:5:36,11 --> 0:5:39,849
used its resources as well as it could,


60
0:5:39,849 --> 0:5:50,789
and still declined.


61
0:5:50,789 --> 0:5:54,5
Chaco Canyon was once covered with lush vegetation


62
0:5:54,5 --> 0:6:0,11
and forests of pine and juniper.


63
0:6:0,11 --> 0:6:1,839
The fertile area was home


64
0:6:1,839 --> 0:6:8,769
to the Anasazi.


65
0:6:8,769 --> 0:6:10,869
From the year 700 on


66
0:6:10,869 --> 0:6:16,57
the Anasazi built the highest and largest buildings in North America.


67
0:6:16,57 --> 0:6:23,0
One is several stories high and has six hundred rooms that overlook the majestic canyon.


68
0:6:23,0 --> 0:6:25,81
One thousand people lived here.


69
0:6:25,81 --> 0:6:28,719
They had no animals to transport materials.


70
0:6:28,719 --> 0:6:36,37
Thousands of felled trees were dragged down to the Chaco Canyon on men's bare backs.


71
0:6:36,37 --> 0:6:42,199
There is no written account of their lives or of their disappearance.


72
0:6:42,199 --> 0:6:46,849
But environmental historians can tell us what happened


73
0:6:46,849 --> 0:6:58,819
by counting tree rings and analyzing rat nests.


74
0:6:58,819 --> 0:7:3,789
Nathan English of the University of Arizona spends much time in the canyon


75
0:7:3,789 --> 0:7:20,399
looking for traces of the ancient nests.


76
0:7:20,399 --> 0:7:24,831
Our interest in Chaco Canyon is to learn more about how the ancestral pueblo once lived


77
0:7:24,831 --> 0:7:26,86
and there's a number of ways we can do that.


78
0:7:26,86 --> 0:7:29,679
We can do that through traditional archaeology where we dig up different sites,


79
0:7:29,679 --> 0:7:34,619
or we can also look at what the environment was like around the ancestral pueblans.


80
0:7:34,619 --> 0:7:38,52
and the way we do that is by looking at pack rat middens.


81
0:7:38,52 --> 0:7:42,319
And each pack rat midden is like a little snapshot in time of


82
0:7:42,319 --> 0:7:46,479
the area around the midden, so if we could think of it like a picture


83
0:7:46,479 --> 0:7:50,569
and the middens can be up to forty-thousand years old in some places.


84
0:7:50,569 --> 0:7:54,359
And what the midden is... the pack rat makes a nest


85
0:7:54,359 --> 0:7:57,889
and it pups in that nest and then it only gets its water from


86
0:7:57,889 --> 0:8:1,849
eating plant vegetation so it's urine is very thick and viscous.


87
0:8:1,849 --> 0:8:6,93
That urine seeps into the pilot group essentially and solidifies almost like amber.


88
0:8:6,93 --> 0:8:9,84
In the meantime the pack rat is also collecting things


89
0:8:9,84 --> 0:8:15,239
from the plants around it, also pot shards sometimes even corn or seeds or squash


90
0:8:15,239 --> 0:8:19,439
And those macro fossils are incorporated into the midden.


91
0:8:19,439 --> 0:8:22,789
So we go out, we collect the midden and then


92
0:8:22,789 --> 0:8:26,795
we examine the macro fossils in that midden to look at


93
0:8:26,795 --> 0:8:30,799
what the ecology around that midden was like at that time.


94
0:8:30,799 --> 0:8:34,8
Not only do rat middens hold information,


95
0:8:34,8 --> 0:8:37,6
trees do too.


96
0:8:37,6 --> 0:8:42,209
Scientists count the rings of ancient logs to give the exact date


97
0:8:42,209 --> 0:8:47,22
when the very last tree was cut down.


98
0:8:47,22 --> 0:8:52,47
The Anasazi used juniper and pine for their timber and fire.


99
0:8:52,47 --> 0:8:57,83
Too much of it something.


100
0:8:57,83 --> 0:9:0,5
With the trees goes the soil


101
0:9:0,5 --> 0:9:2,57
The forest cannot recover.


102
0:9:2,57 --> 0:9:7,83
Because of erosion water drains down creating gulleys on the way.


103
0:9:7,83 --> 0:9:12,37
Irrigation and agriculture are no longer possible.


104
0:9:12,37 --> 0:9:18,56
This large population cannot feed itself anymore.


105
0:9:18,56 --> 0:9:21,72
But did they destroy the forests?


106
0:9:21,72 --> 0:9:24,6
Or did the forests leave them?


107
0:9:24,6 --> 0:9:27,14
We are on the edge of this pine and juniper woodland and so it's really


108
0:9:27,14 --> 0:9:30,78
possible that just natural climate change would have caused it to move back,


109
0:9:30,78 --> 0:9:34,5
but it's also we know that the people were harvesting wood for fuel and for timber


110
0:9:34,5 --> 0:9:37,83
and so it's likely that a combination of the two things are what


111
0:9:37,83 --> 0:9:43,36
led to the to the loss of forest in this area.


112
0:9:43,36 --> 0:9:47,9
The year 1130 rolls around.


113
0:9:47,9 --> 0:9:50,2
It is one of the driest of years.


114
0:9:50,2 --> 0:9:52,89
The Anasazi have survived previous droughts,


115
0:9:52,89 --> 0:9:56,13
but the population has increased quickly.


116
0:9:56,13 --> 0:10:0,66
And there's no suitable territory to expand into.


117
0:10:0,66 --> 0:10:1,61
Without rain


118
0:10:1,61 --> 0:10:9,42
it's impossible to grow enough food to support the population.


119
0:10:9,42 --> 0:10:16,95
No agriculture means no culture.


120
0:10:16,95 --> 0:10:31,83
The Chaco Canyon is abandoned.


121
0:10:31,83 --> 0:10:35,87
These ancient Americans cut down the last tree,


122
0:10:35,87 --> 0:11:4,79
and moved on.


123
0:11:4,79 --> 0:11:7,15
Over in Europe in 1491


124
0:11:7,15 --> 0:11:24,8
they are cutting down the forests rapidly.


125
0:11:24,8 --> 0:11:27,26
Their growing population needs more food


126
0:11:27,26 --> 0:11:30,22
and more space in which to grow it.


127
0:11:30,22 --> 0:11:47,76
And they badly need the wood.


128
0:11:47,76 --> 0:11:49,18
They have the tools.


129
0:11:49,18 --> 0:12:0,33
They have the means to transport it.


130
0:12:0,33 --> 0:12:7,3
And they have the energy.


131
0:12:7,3 --> 0:12:15,14
But they are beginning to run out of space... and time.


132
0:12:15,14 --> 0:12:21,84
Only wood can help them to move forward.


133
0:12:21,84 --> 0:12:27,27
The middle ages were the era of wood.


134
0:12:27,27 --> 0:12:28,371
You find it wherever you look.


135
0:12:28,371 --> 0:12:32,35
Wood was the most important material for building, for making tools,


136
0:12:32,35 --> 0:12:41,52
and furniture and for burning. It was the only fuel. There was hardly any coal.


137
0:12:41,52 --> 0:12:46,99
It is an era of competition and wars use up forests too.


138
0:12:46,99 --> 0:12:48,72
Whole armies are equipped


139
0:12:48,72 --> 0:12:54,24
with bows made from yew wood. The yew tree is almost exterminated in Europe.


140
0:12:54,24 --> 0:13:23,58
Armies need iron weapons and smelting ovens burn day and night.


141
0:13:23,58 --> 0:15:23,58
At the same time whole forests are used to satisfy another European craving:
