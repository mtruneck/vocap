###47 FEMALE SPEAKER: Have you always been an artist?
###49 THOM DEVITA: What'd you say?
###51 FEMALE SPEAKER: Have you always been an artist?
###52 THOM DEVITA: Yeah, for about 40 years.
###55 JOHN WYATT: He's the greatest tattooer.
###57 FEMALE SPEAKER: Greatest tattooer?
###59 [INAUDIBLE].
###59 THOM DEVITA: I can do that also.
###62 FEMALE SPEAKER: You can, yeah.
###63 
###69 THOM DEVITA: Every shop I went in, I'd tell them I'm deVita.
###75 And they never heard of deVita.
###77 You walk out like you're an idiot, you know?
###80 Who the hell is deVita?
###83 JOHN WYATT: And now they're honored to have you.
###87 THOM DEVITA: Oh, let me finish.
###89 
###108 JOHN WYATT: When they meet Thom, they will realize
###112 they've never met anybody like him before.
###115 He's probably the most different person, without
###118 trying to be different, of anybody I've ever met.
###122 He's so many different things.
###124 He's a tattoo artist, but he's also a fine artist.
###128 I think he's one of the true originals.
###130 THOM DEVITA: But you've got these lines in here anyway
###134 from the cardboard.
###135 MALE SPEAKER: The corrugation, yeah.
###137 I really like it.
###138 There's a good, strong iconic strike to it.
###141 Where in the city were you located?
###143 THOM DEVITA: On the Lower East Side.
###144 MALE SPEAKER: Very nice.
###145 THOM DEVITA: It wasn't nice when I went there.
###148 MALE SPEAKER: I guess it's nice today, right?
###150 It's all about [INAUDIBLE].
###151 THOM DEVITA: Thanks for coming in.
###152 Take a card.
###154 MALE SPEAKER: Wow, deVita.
###158 NICK BUBASH: What I try to get across about Thom deVita to
###161 anybody that's interested--
###163 he wasn't just a tattoo artist, he was
###165 an artist who tattooed.
###168 It was all one big ball of wax with him.
###170 Everything he did was art--
###173 the way he lived, the way he talked, the way he thought,
###176 what he did, where he went.
###178 The tattoos were just as important as the floor.
###182 And then it all came up on onto his body.
###185 I mean, it was everywhere.
###186 
###194 JOHN WYATT: Have you ever done commercial art, Thom?
###196 THOM DEVITA: Yeah, tattooing.
###197 
###200 Art that pays.
###202 JOHN WYATT: When's the last time you
###204 set up a tattoo machine?
###205 THOM DEVITA: Not too long ago.
###208 Last year when I was [INAUDIBLE]
###211 I'd write my name on tattooers.
###215 JOHN WYATT: Aren't you going to a convention this year?
###218 THOM DEVITA: Yeah, in October.
###219 JOHN WYATT: October?
###220 
###234 BUBBA REEVES: I knew that Thom, he wasn't wanting to do
###237 a whole lot more conventions.
###239 But I knew that his book had came out, and his wife, Jenny,
###243 had lost her job.
###244 And so Thom kind of had to be the money maker again.
###248 And Ed loves to have him out here, and so I've kind of been
###252 helping Thom out with his travels and
###254 his sales and stuff.
###257 He sells his artwork.
###260 He still works all day, everyday,
###263 just like he tattooed.
###264 But now he does it on paper.
###266 So he has plenty of artwork to sell of tattoo stencils and
###270 rubbings and stuff like that.
###273 When I first seen Thom's stuff, I was wanting to get my
###276 back tattooed from him or something real big.
###279 But by that time, he was already done tattooing.
###282 I think it's been about 10 years since he's
###284 tattooed for a living.
###286 Well, the main thing, when you get a tattoo by Thom, is he's
###289 going to have to like you.
###291 You're going to have to pass this thing that you want to
###295 get a tattoo from him, and you understand
###297 that his hand shakes.
###299 I tell them my hands shake and I'm drunk,
###304 and they don't care.
###306 BUBBA REEVES: His signature is what he does.
###309 That's his last name with his birth date.
###312 Since he's been tattooing, he tattoos for
###315 $30 always, I heard.
###318 And so he charges the tattooers that get tattooed by
###321 him $30 for his name.
###324 The first time I heard about Thom was through the "Tattoo
###327 Times," and I was like man, this guy's
###329 doing something special.
###332 ED HARDY: When we did this "Tattoo Times" series in
###334 magazines, my primary goal with that was to enlighten
###336 people, make people realize that there was a lot more
###338 depth and history and complexity to tattooing than
###341 anybody realized.
###342 And then finally, by the fifth issue, I was like, oh my god,
###344 I've got to do something on Malone, who was
###346 a very close friend.
###347 And he introduced me to deVita.
###348 And do a piece on deVita, because deVita's was such an
###351 important guy.
###352 Hopefully, it woke people up to who he was.
###355 Culturally, it was a subterranean practice, and
###358 deVita was sub-subterranean.
###359 
###362 ROBERT RYAN: When people say that someone has a cult
###364 following, I think that people that know and get it really
###368 appreciate his work and really have a lot of love for it.
###370 And I think it flies over the heads of a lot
###372 of people as well.
###374 I was a deVita devotee from the beginning.
###378 It just unlocked this whole world that I was already
###380 totally into of the Lower East Side of New York.
###383 There's this creative energy there that I think Thom's work
###387 definitely emanates.
###388 There's not a lot of care-taking in trying to nail
###393 each line so everything's perfect.
###395 But I think he captures the essence and the energy of a
###398 tattoo design.
###400 NICK BUBASH: It had an earthiness to it.
###402 It had soul to it.
###403 Thom characterizes it as folk art.
###406 He says all tattooing is folk art.
###409 That's right from his mouth.
###411 MALE SPEAKER: Now they've turned into things that the
###413 Metropolitan Museum could display proudly, some of the
###416 tattoos that are being done.
###418 THOM DEVITA: But it's still folk art.
###419 MALE SPEAKER: Those humble beginnings.
###420 THOM DEVITA: But it's still folk art.
###421 MALE SPEAKER: But once it gets put on your body, it
###425 becomes folk art.
###426 THOM DEVITA: Instantly.
###428 Some of them are real folk art.
###429 
###432 I work with traditional tattoo designs.
###434 
###438 I like repeating myself.
###441 That's why I like tattooing.
###443 It's just drawing the same panthers on a hundred guys.
###448 I have a hard time copying what someone else had done.
###452 But I'd start off with the Coleman design, and I would
###456 fill it in a little differenty, because you just
###459 can't copy.
###461 MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, I got one on my leg.
###463 I only have one piece of his.
###465 It's on the back of this leg.
###467 He did it all with a shader.
###470 It was from a design on his wall that was some kind of
###473 Catholic image.
###475 CLAYTON PATTERSON: His flash would be on pieces of wood.
###478 Have you seen his flash?
###478 JOHN WYATT: Yeah.
###479 THOM DEVITA: Here's a piece that was
###480 done on Fourth Street.
###482 
###485 And that's my flash from 30 years ago.
###501 ANGELO SCOTTO: At the time, you didn't think people would
###503 get those tattoos, you know what I mean?
###505 But it was art.
###506 I said, wow.
###507 I said, it's totally different from what we were used to.
###510 That was, you went from Spaulding and Rogers' flash to
###513 Thom deVita's designs, which was a total transformation.
###518 Like overnight, you could blink your
###519 eyes, you'd say, wow.
###521 MALE SPEAKER: That's probably the most different piece of
###524 flash I've ever seen.
###528 CLAYTON PATTERSON: Part of what this whole dialogue is
###530 about is transformation of tattooing from kind of a
###533 classic, conservative, traditional style to
###537 eventually it breaks out into this whole new matrix.
###541 NICK BUBASH: I never thought of them as high art.
###544 When I went to deVita's place, and I saw what he was doing,
###546 that I started thinking of as art.
###550 He's still kind of esoteric.
###552 You have to know what you're talking about.
###554 You have go into the history of it.
###555 You have to find out the early beginnings of modern tattooing
###559 to understand we're all standing on the shoulders of
###562 other people.
###563 And a lot of us are standing on the shoulders of Thom.
###567 ROBERT RYAN: The thing that really struck me about
###570 deVita's place in tattooing was he wasn't a biker, he
###574 wasn't military, he wasn't carny-- he was just a guy
###579 making his art.
###580 And it was rooted in traditional tattooing, but it
###585 was his take on it.
###587 And the people that he influenced in tattooing after
###590 that are definitely a lot of the people that I also looked
###593 up to as well as Thom--
###595 guys like Ed, and Mike Malone, Nick Bubash, Tux Farrar, Dan
###601 Higgs, Cliff Raven, too.
###603 No, none of those guys come from that lineage of biker,
###608 carny, hot rod.
###611 It's just like this almost poetic approach to tattooing
###616 that you didn't really have before Thom.
###618 
###621 And for Thom, it even went further, because he was more
###624 into the experience.
###626 And I think that goes back a lot further than what we know
###630 as our American history in tattooing.
###633 I think that goes back to the beginnings of it, where it was
###638 something that happened in tribes and villages and small
###641 places all over the world.
###644 SCOTT HARRISON: The mark itself has this sort of
###647 significant form, to use the [INAUDIBLE] term.
###650 But it's just like each mark is sort of an expression.
###654 And Thom, he does what he's inspired to do at the moment.
###658 I'd been wanting to get my chest tattooed for a while,
###661 and so I picked out this panther head with a
###663 snake in its mouth.
###664 Perfect design for a chest.
###665 It would fit perfectly.
###667 He initially just put it so it was, like, half covering
###670 another tattoo.
###671 It was like, there's plenty of space, but he chose to put
###673 it-- he's like, see, it's not going to work.
###675 And I'm like, oh, you could just move it.
###676 So he washes it off.
###677 And while I'm standing there waiting for him, he sneaks up
###680 behind me and puts a stencil on the back of my arm.
###682 He's like, that's where it should be.
###685 I told you when I got my first deVita tattoo in New York, I
###688 came and showed it to Bernie Luther.
###689 And he was like, it's so ugly.
###693 And I go swimming with tattooers and they're like,
###696 oh, I've never seen anyone like a bad tattoo that much.
###701 It's like, dude, you don't see it.
###702 You're not stepping back out of the commercial art form and
###706 seeing that there's this larger thing.
###709 It's like the difference between listening to something
###711 like Kenny G or listening to the Stooges.
###717 You're missing the point.
###720 My favorite wind bars.
###721 You did the wind bars.
###722 They're so good.
###725 SCOTT HARRISON: You did those!
###726 THOM DEVITA: Yeah?
###727 SCOTT HARRISON: Yep.
###729 Who else would have does those?
###732 THOM DEVITA: Whenever we tattoo, we collaborate.
###737 If you get something that Nick done on somebody, or with any
###742 tattooer, and somebody else worked on it, on the guy's
###747 body, it means you're collaborating.
###748 
###753 SCOTT HARRISON: That's one thing Thom loves is when
###755 there's an old advertising pane on the wall.
###758 And then part of it's painted out, but you can see it
###760 through, and there's another one on there.
###761 And then there's another thing over there, and there's a
###764 little graffiti-- he loves that layering effect.
###766 
###771 CLAYTON PATTERSON: Tattoos tend to be classic--
###774 a dragon, a tribal, an abstract, but never the whole
###780 combination.
###781 Now the other thing Thom does, which almost nobody else does,
###784 is people will cover up a tattoo.
###786 And to me, there's a richness and beauty
###788 with really old colors.
###789 So then he would take his new stencil, snap it down, and
###793 then so now he's got one of his tribal tattoos totally
###796 covering this area.
###797 He might maybe blacken this whole part in through to here,
###801 leave this part of the eye and head, and then maybe finish
###804 off the tribal coming down here, leaving this part.
###808 And so it's like a collage.
###811 And people now, when they're going to redo a tattoo, it's a
###813 standard way of thinking.
###814 I don't care how creative the artist is, he looks at the
###817 tattoo, and he thinks, OK, I'm going to cover
###818 this whole thing up.
###819 You get very few people who try to integrate with the old.
###822 You've got the tribal mixed with the other elements, and
###825 now you've got a whole different look.
###827 And some of Carlos' tattoos, I hope there's really great
###830 pictures of those, because that's a classy example of
###832 that collage weave that I've never seen anybody else do up
###836 until this point.
###837 
###840 That's the one thing that's totally unique and amazing
###843 about Thom, which is also the drawback factor.
###845 Because original is not really respected that much.
###849 Because original, especially in a conservative world, kind
###851 of shakes the whole thing up.
###853 NICK BUBASH: There's a book called "The Tipping Point"--
###855 have you ever read that?
###855 That shows you how one person or a group of people can
###859 influence the entire world with what they're doing.
###862 And I think that's pretty much what Thom did.
###865 And I don't know that Thom knew he was doing it, either.
###868 It's just what he was doing, you know what I mean?
###871 He didn't set out saying, well, I'm going to change the
###873 world with this.
###875 He's not that kind of a person anyway.
###878 He's a very humble man, and he was just
###881 doing what he was doing.
###882 He was making art, which he does absolutely, automatically
###886 and completely naturally.
###889 He's on automatic.
###890 He never stops.
###892 What is he, 80-years-old with Parkinson's disease now?
###895 He's shaking, and he's still making art every day.
###898 He'll never quit.
###899 One time I asked him, are you doing anything different?
###901 And he says, nah, I'm just doing the same old stuff.
###904 
###908 He still gets excited about it, too, in kind of a low-tone
###913 excitement.
###913 What are you doing?
###914 I'm working on a bunch of panda bears.
###916 THOM DEVITA: What do you want to see?
###918 The panda scrolls?
###919 JOHN WYATT: Did you see the panda scroll?
###920 MALE SPEAKER: No, I don't think so.
###922 JOHN WYATT: That's important.
###924 
###942 JOHN WYATT: Did you paint this is response to something?
###943 THOM DEVITA: Yes, in response of Ed's 2,000 dragons.
###947 I was going to do 2,000 pandas.
###953 JOHN WYATT: Did you ever show this to him?
###955 THOM DEVITA: Yeah, he's seen it, sure.
###957 
###960 You should take [INAUDIBLE] down like this.
###963
