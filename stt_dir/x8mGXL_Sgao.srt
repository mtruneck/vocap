3
0:0:17,8 --> 0:0:18,8
Sup, sup.


4
0:0:18,8 --> 0:0:21,52
It's Kreayshawn and this
is my wildest party


5
0:0:21,52 --> 0:0:23,26
adventure I've ever had.


6
0:0:23,26 --> 0:0:24,78
The 4th of July.


7
0:0:24,78 --> 0:0:27,496
The 4th of July you kind of set
out to go get wasted with


8
0:0:27,496 --> 0:0:28,49
all of your friends.


9
0:0:28,49 --> 0:0:30,41
Me and all my friends
go to this party.


10
0:0:30,41 --> 0:0:33,54
So it's like all the cute boys
that don't go to your school


11
0:0:33,54 --> 0:0:35,6
that were too good for you.


12
0:0:35,6 --> 0:0:38,55
Everyone's dressed preppy, and
we're kinda dressed hood, I


13
0:0:38,55 --> 0:0:41,88
guess, like, white tees, blue
jeans, and sneakers.


14
0:0:41,88 --> 0:0:44,73
My friend hands me a bottle
of whiskey and no one has


15
0:0:44,73 --> 0:0:47,64
chasers, so I find a big
old water bottle.


16
0:0:47,64 --> 0:0:49,33
I'm drinking this
whiskey about to


17
0:0:49,33 --> 0:0:50,66
chase it with the water.


18
0:0:50,66 --> 0:0:52,54
And the water ended
up being vodka.


19
0:0:52,54 --> 0:0:55,8
And it was the most disgusting
thing ever.


20
0:0:55,8 --> 0:0:57,53
We're just getting super
drunk and one of my


21
0:0:57,53 --> 0:0:58,79
friends gets lost.


22
0:0:58,79 --> 0:1:0,78
So we find her upstairs.


23
0:1:0,78 --> 0:1:3,11
And she's passed out
in some room.


24
0:1:3,11 --> 0:1:5,59
And in the room, there's a whole
bunch of weed cookies.


25
0:1:5,59 --> 0:1:8,75
Us being us, we just start
taking all the weed cookies,


26
0:1:8,75 --> 0:1:13,22
and we're just floating and
playing weird music, and just


27
0:1:13,22 --> 0:1:14,54
looking at all the stars.


28
0:1:14,54 --> 0:1:16,7
And you can hear fireworks.


29
0:1:16,7 --> 0:1:18,5
And during all this drunken
craziness, I


30
0:1:18,5 --> 0:1:20,9
pocket-dialed my mom.


31
0:1:20,9 --> 0:1:22,2
My mom starts freaking
out because she


32
0:1:22,2 --> 0:1:23,375
thinks I've been kidnapped.


33
0:1:23,375 --> 0:1:26,5
So we go to the next party
in this pickup truck.


34
0:1:26,5 --> 0:1:30,4
We heard these rumors of
there being 100 blunts.


35
0:1:30,4 --> 0:1:32,48
It ends up being at
a frat house.


36
0:1:32,48 --> 0:1:34,54
There's a tray with
100 blunts.


37
0:1:34,54 --> 0:1:37,76
And there's literally every
type of 40 you can have.


38
0:1:37,76 --> 0:1:40,1
Me and my friends instantly
start taking all these blunts


39
0:1:40,1 --> 0:1:42,98
and putting them behind our
ears and in our pockets.


40
0:1:42,98 --> 0:1:45,22
We're trying to take as
many blunts as we can.


41
0:1:45,22 --> 0:1:48,823
My mom is going crazy, calling
me over and over again.


42
0:1:48,823 --> 0:1:52,67
We all go to my friend's house,
and we passed out.


43
0:1:52,67 --> 0:1:56,745
And the next morning, I wake
up super high to like 200


44
0:1:56,745 --> 0:2:0,52
missed calls and texts from
my mom and my grandpa.


45
0:2:0,52 --> 0:2:3,69
And they called the police
as if I was kidnapped.


46
0:2:3,69 --> 0:2:5,99
So that was my craziest party.


47
0:2:5,99 --> 0:4:5,99
