###38 This is it.
###39 l'm standing on the very spot
###41 where many Christians believe the world will come to an end.
###44 lt's called Megiddo.
###46 And it's the place that the Book of Revelation says
###48 Jesus Christ will come down to
###51 to end the world and save the people who believe in him.
###54 Now when Revelations was written,
###56 only God had the capacity to end the world,
###59 but now man does too, because unfortunately,
###63 before man figured out how to be rational
###65 or peaceful, he figured out nuclear weapons
###68 and how to pollute on a catastrophic scale.
###70 And if it's one thing l hate more than prophecy,
###73 it's self-fulfilling prophecy.
###78 Sometimes in your search for happiness,
###81 you ponder the meaning of your life.
###84 Who am l? How did l come to be?
###86 Death, and then what?
###91 l certainly honestly believe
###93 religion is detrimental
###96 to the progress of humanity.
###98 You know, it's just selling an invisible product.
###100 lt's too easy.
###102 These questions about what happens when you die,
###105 they so freak people out
###109 that they will just make up any story
###112 and cling to it.
###114 You know, things that they know
###116 can't be true, people who are otherwise
###119 so rational about everything else,
###121 and then they believe that
###123 on Sunday they're drinking the blood
###125 of a 2,000-year-old God.
###128 l can't-- that's a dissonance in my head.
###131 l can't-- l have to find out.
###134 l just have to find out. l have to try.
###161 This is the Mount of Olives. This is Jesus's footprints.
###165 We're here freezing our ass off.
###172 ls there anybody on the stage that
###175 - does not believe in evolution? - Yeah.
###180 Hurry hurry hurry.
###186 - l like my hat. - You look good too.
###189 Welcome to Bible Country!
###191 ''Birthplace of the Virgin Mary''?
###196 l believe that God wants everybody to be free.
###199 That's what l believe,
###201 and that's one part of my foreign policy.
###207 Bill, watch out.
###212 Boy, do l feel cheap.
###220 l want to thank God for just blessing me so much.
###222 Music has been a blessing from God.
###224 Thank you, Jesus!
###226 You need a Holy Ghost enema right up your rear end!
###240 The archives are there on the fifth floor where you see the curtains.
###242 Yeah, put that away now. Put that away.
###247 lf you look at my stand-up
###249 from like the '80s-- that era--
###252 early '90s,
###255 l talked about religion, but l'm not ever questioning God.
###259 l'm just making fun about things
###261 in the religion-- circumcision.
###263 Circumcision-- l mean, l would've loved
###265 to have been there for the first people to hear about this.
###269 We're used to it now, but you know, l mean,
###271 l'm sure when Moses came down with this idea,
###273 there had to be one guy going,
###275 ''Let me get this straight.''
###278 lt was just a gentle poking fun at Him.
###280 lt's almost like l'm roasting Him.
###282 My mother is Jewish and my father is Catholic. That is the truth.
###285 l was raised Catholic formally,
###287 although l must say the Jewish mind comes out
###289 even in the Catholic system. l'll give you an example.
###291 We used to go into confession
###293 and l would bring a lawyer in with me.
###300 You know.
###302 Bless me, Father, for l have sinned.
###304 l think you know Mr. Cohen.
###310 So let me get out some pictures.
###313 There's me.
###315 We weren't brought up Jewish.
###317 l didn't even know we had that side,
###320 so it was very Catholic.
###322 We went to church every Sunday,
###325 but l wouldn't take off the gun
###327 and really when l think back,
###329 it wasn't relevant to my life.
###331 Superman was relevant and baseball.
###335 We had this family
###337 where one person was Jewish
###340 and the other three were Catholic.
###343 Now there it says ''A Sunday noon, fall '66,''
###346 so we must've just gotten back from church,
###349 'cause l'm in a red suit
###351 and you're choking the dog.
###354 And l guess we got home from church and took a picture with you.
###358 lt never occurred to me to say,
###360 ''Why didn't you go to church?''
###361 Mom...
###363 what church do we belong to?
###366 l don't remember this ever coming up.
###368 Of course you didn't go to church with us.
###370 No, we never had a family discussion about it, never.
###372 We never had a family discussion about that.
###374 Every family is dysfunctional.
###378 So you thought even this, which wasn't your religion,
###381 was better than no religion.
###383 Well, even this only told you good things...
###387 l thought.
###388 But it's just so shamelessly invented as they go along.
###392 - We can say that now. - Was anyone--
###395 When we quit the church, l was 1 3,
###398 and l was of course thrilled, but not for any ideological reason.
###401 l was just thrilled 'cause l hated church.
###403 lt scared me. lt was boring.
###405 l had to get up on Sunday.
###407 l was 1 3.
###408 l would've worshiped anything that could've allowed me
###411 to masturbate even more than l was masturbating
###414 or get a girl. That god l would have definitely worshipped.
###418 Why do you remember
###420 Dad stopped going to church?
###422 We used birth control,
###425 and the church frowned on birth control.
###428 That was the biggest sin
###430 - you could ever commit. - Right, that would--
###434 l think that was possibly-- he never said it to me.
###437 And he never went back. None of us ever did.
###440 So now that we don't believe,
###443 where did--
###445 Nobody said we don't believe.
###446 We don't believe in Catholicism.
###451 Right, but what do we believe in now?
###454 Come on. You're my mother, instruct me.
###458 l don't know the answer to that.
###460 That's my answer.
###461 We'll take some back roads to see
###465 - some interesting stuff out here. - Take some back roads.
###467 We are heading toward Raleigh, right?
###469 Oh, yeah, man, can't you feel it?
###494 Do l stand up here? So as l was going here,
###496 l just jotted down a few questions that came to my mind.
###499 Are you ever bothered by many things
###502 that are in Christianity that are not in the Bible?
###505 Like original sin.
###508 lmmaculate conception.
###509 The virgin birth is only in two of the Gospels-- popes.
###513 Are you worried that these things came not from the founders,
###516 the people that wrote this book, but from--
###519 and this is indisputable-- but from men,
###521 from human beings who came after?
###523 And when l say men, l mean people with penises.
###528 lf you wanna go back to scientific proof,
###529 l think it was determined the shroud or whatever that was
###531 went around a while back-- l didn't get involved.
###533 - Shroud of Turin? - They took blood samples from it,
###536 and it was female blood with a male figure.
###538 Okay, the only possible way that could happen was
###540 that the Holy Ghost impregnated Mary
###544 because it would've been female blood
###546 because it would've been the only blood flowing through her.
###550 - lt's a faith thing. - But why is faith good?
###552 Why is believing something without evidence good?
###555 l don't like the way this thing's going.
###556 l don't know what this documentary's supposed to be,
###558 but l don't like where you're going.
###560 You start disputing my God,
###563 and you got a problem. l don't know what you--
###567 l'm outta here. You do what you wanna do, but l'm outta here.
###573 - l'm just asking questions. - Okay, no problem.
###575 When l've seen what l've seen, l know there's a God.
###578 You can't change my mind. Nobody can change my mind.
###581 l walked for 30 years as a Satanist priest.
###584 From the time l grew up, l was in Satanism.
###586 For the last six years, that l was into Satanism,
###589 l was a Satanist priest, okay?
###591 - Real Satanism? - Yes, real Satanism.
###593 Being addicted to drugs, and running prostitutes
###596 and the women and everything that goes with that.
###598 l walked around with rolls of money in my pocket.
###601 l gave all that up when l got saved.
###603 When the guy said, ''Yeah, l used to do drugs.
###605 l used to have women,'' and l'm thinking,
###609 - ''And your problem was?'' - Right.
###612 Let me ask you this question:
###613 What if we're right and you're wrong?
###615 We gonna make it and you ain't.
###617 lf you're being good just to save your ass
###619 just because, ''Ooh, they might be right
###621 and l just want to double down here
###624 and make sure that when l get up to the pearly gates,
###626 that St. Peter doesn't say to me,
###628 'Sorry, asshole, you had the wrong religion.
###630 Enjoy Hell, buh-bye.'''
###632 That's not a good reason, and you know that.
###634 Come on, believe in Jesus. What do you have to lose?
###637 lt's like the lotto.
###639 You can't get saved if you don't play.
###641 Yeah, you could be right. l don't think it's very likely,
###644 but, yes, you could be right, because my big thing is l don't know.
###647 That's what l preach.
###648 l preach the gospel of l don't know!
###652 l mean that's what l'm here promoting-- doubt.
###654 - That's my product. - Right.
###655 The other guys are selling certainty, not me.
###658 l'm on the corner with doubt.
###660 So, Dr. Collins,
###662 you are a brilliant brilliant scientist,
###664 the head of the Human Genome Project.
###667 Now here's what's so puzzling is that you are
###670 the one scientist--
###672 the one famous scientist anyway--
###674 who's also religious. Explain that to me.
###677 l would argue that if you look at the evidence,
###679 the historical evidence of Christ's existence is overwhelming.
###683 What evidence?
###684 l mean, l've never even heard anyone propose that there's evidence.
###688 There's been proof that there's a Jesus.
###690 - That's been proven. - That hasn't been proven.
###692 How you figure that one?
###695 When l read the New Testament,
###696 it reads to me as the record of eyewitnesses
###699 who put down what they saw.
###701 You know they weren't eyewitnesses.
###703 - They were close to that. - No.
###705 Within a couple of decades of eyewitnesses.
###708 - Okay. - Would that stand up in a laboratory
###711 as absolute foolproof evidence
###714 that something happened?
###716 You are setting up a standard for proof
###718 that l think would really be an almost impossible standard to meet.
###721 No gospel tells us what he was doing when he was a young man.
###725 You know, we see Jesus as an infant
###727 and then we kind of pick up the story when he's 30.
###731 l think Jesus was probably an awkward teenager--
###733 big Jewfro, bad at sports.
###736 Here l am!
###739 The records we have are all gospels.
###741 Gospels are not history.
###744 Gospel writers never met Jesus, neither did St. Paul.
###747 No one who wrote about Jesus ever met him.
###749 How can you go back into the prophets
###751 and the prophets specifically specifies that certain things--
###753 Well, first of all,
###755 the New Testament came after the Old Testament. We agree to that?
###757 l agree to that, but that doesn't mean anything.
###759 All it means is the people that wrote the New Testament
###762 read the Old Testament and then made the prophesies fit.
###765 They can't make it fit if something didn't happen.
###767 Of course they can.
###768 Then you're saying the Bible is fictitious?
###771 - l am. - Can't be.
###772 l am.
###774 We do all know that those texts don't match.
###776 Yeah, sure. Would you expect them to?
###778 l'm surprised that things that are very important to the story
###781 like the virgin birth isn't in all four of them.
###784 Wouldn't you really expect that kind of discordance when you're
###787 thinking about the way in which these documents came into being?
###790 But you'd think if you were one of Christ's biographers,
###793 that would be sort of an important thing not to leave out.
###797 Oh, God, he was also born of a virgin.
###800 They don't notice the virgin birth.
###802 You know, l think that is something if you were any sort of reporter
###806 you'd put into the story.
###808 What editor looks at the facts and goes, ''Yeah, but take out the thing
###812 about the virgin birth. That's not interesting.''
###816 l think being without faith
###818 is something that's a luxury
###820 for people who were fortunate enough
###822 to have a fortunate life.
###824 You know, you go to prison
###826 and you hear a guy say, ''You know what, buddy?
###828 l got nothing but Jesus in here.''
###830 l completely understand that.
###832 l think not having faith is a luxury sometimes.
###835 lf you're in a foxhole, you probably have a lot of faith, right?
###838 - Mm-hmm. - So l get that.
###840 But you guys aren't dumb. You're smart people.
###843 How can smart people--
###844 how can they believe in the talking snake,
###847 people living to 900 years old and the virgin birth?
###850 And you know, that's my question.
###852 You guys have your own questions.
###853 Pray for me.
###855 Father, in the name of Jesus and by the power of the Holy Spirit,
###858 we ask right now, Lord, as we lift up Bill to You, Father,
###860 that You can answer his questions that we can't answer.
###863 Father, we thank You right now for the opportunity
###865 that has come today,
###867 that we may voice our opinions and hear others.
###870 So we ask You, Lord, to touch
###871 and feel wisdom right now in the name of Jesus.
###874 And we thank You for it in Jesus's name, amen.
###876 Thank you for being Christlike, and not just Christian.
###880 Okay. Hey, my wallet!
###883 No, l'm kidding.
###886 You see so many nice people trying to make it about
###890 something good
###891 and yet it turns into not just corrupt,
###894 but, like, fucking-little-kids corrupt
###897 and burning-people-alive cor--
###900 l mean, really evil shit.
###902 l'd like to see 10,000 people
###905 give $10,000.
###907 Write your biggest check and send it in.
###909 We got people on welfare that's got enough faith to make a $1,000 vow
###912 - and paying it! - l want to be in the green, Lord!
###918 What l'm about to say is revelation.
###921 l got it on DVD. And l have it on DVD.
###923 And you need to get this. Hallelujah!
###929 Hallelujah!
###935 Reverend. ls that what l call you?
###937 No, just call me... doctor.
###939 - Doctor? - Yeah.
###942 All right, Doc. First of all, l have to tell you, when l heard that
###945 you were in Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes,
###947 l was like, ''That's my man.''
###954 And it's funny, because that lyric
###956 can be interpreted religiously.
###958 ''lf you don't know me by now.'' Right?
###960 l mean, you must've thought of that.
###962 The song did go platinum.
###966 Teddy Pendergrass, who led the song,
###968 he was ordained a minister when he was 10 years old.
###971 What do you think it says about religion
###973 and how serious it is
###975 if you can be a minister when you're 10?
###980 But there is a comparison to be made between
###984 musical stars, rock stars
###986 and religious figures. They very often both dress
###988 - in elaborate costumes... - Mm-hmm.
###991 ...that get people's attention.
###1006 People in a congregation
###1008 must know that the outfit was financed
###1010 by their donations, and it doesn't seem to bother them.
###1013 l always dress well.
###1015 l see! Are those gators?
###1018 Those are lizards.
###1019 - Lizards? - Yes.
###1021 - What do they run? - They don't run. They crawl.
###1026 And l see you got a lot of bling.
###1028 l like gold. The people want you to look well.
###1032 That's what pimps say about their women.
###1034 l was told by one of the greatest pimps that ever lived--
###1038 his name is called God--
###1041 that if you know what you got,
###1042 then you ain't got much.
###1044 Jesus dressed very well.
###1046 Oh, come on.
###1048 - Where is the Biblical evidence? - Wait a minute.
###1050 When he was born, they brought him gold.
###1053 They brought him gold. He was not poor.
###1055 So my image of Jesus as a man
###1058 who championed the poor and walked around
###1060 in simple garb, that's wrong?
###1063 lt was linen. lt was fine linen.
###1065 - Really? - Yeah.
###1067 But Jesus constantly preaches against rich people.
###1070 The Bible does not speak against being rich.
###1073 - Jesus does. Very plainly. - No no.
###1076 Jesus was very very against the rich.
###1079 He never preached against being poor. Blessed are the poor in spirit, for--
###1082 No, he preached against being rich.
###1084 No no no, he said that it's better for a rich man--
###1087 than a rich man to enter--
###1090 lt is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle
###1094 than for a rich man to enter the Kingdom.
###1096 Okay, but now things like houses and cars
###1100 and clothes and money,
###1103 they come as a result
###1105 of my seeking God first.
###1107 l don't remember that
###1109 in the New Testament specifically.
###1111 But it's there. l remember it.
###1113 The houses, the cars
###1114 and the clothes, they'll come.
###1115 Yeah, money comes, money happens, you know.
###1119 Well, money happens for you because they're giving it up to you.
###1122 You're not giving it up to them.
###1125 Let me set the record straight.
###1126 l do not receive a salary from the church.
###1128 l do not take a salary from the church.
###1130 - You take it right out of the pot. - No no no.
###1132 lt's such a powerful position.
###1134 l mean, you hold people's
###1136 greatest hopes and dreams in the palm of your hand, really.
###1140 Certainly, some of the young women must get a crush on you.
###1146 Probably. l would too if l was out there.
###1149 lf l was a woman, l'd probably have a crush on me, too.
###1151 That's keepin' it real.
###1153 Now l can advise other young men about women, because l've been there.
###1157 l had a young man who was about to go crazy over a woman.
###1160 He was about to kill himself, you know?
###1162 l said, ''That kind of passion, you should have for God.''
###1165 l said, ''Turn that to God and see what happens.''
###1171 St. Paul, for example, whom l know you compare yourself to.
###1175 People do.
###1177 But he famously only wore on his back
###1180 the clothes that he owned.
###1182 - Should l assume that this is-- - He was always on the run.
###1184 This is your only $2,000 suit?
###1188 The gentleman who made this suit for me
###1190 owns a clothing store.
###1192 Mr. Kane, you in the house?
###1194 The prices that l get my clothes for--
###1197 - you know, l'm blessed in that area. - Yes, you are.
###1200 l'm more blessed than l've ever been all the days of my life.
###1203 And the owner is a Muslim, which-- l came out of lslam.
###1207 l know, l think it's very interesting that you're a Christian now,
###1210 you were a Muslim and when you get your clothes,
###1213 you buy them like a Jew.
###1217 And action!
###1219 That's right-- behind me and above me is the original Twin Cities,
###1222 Sodom and Gomorrah.
###1223 Apparently, it was a pretty wicked place.
###1226 How wicked?
###1227 Well let's just say that what happened in Gomorrah,
###1230 stayed in Gomorrah.
###1236 That is until God got wind of it,
###1237 so he sent two angels to investigate.
###1240 Now the angels went to the house
###1242 of the one godly man in town-- Lot.
###1245 And the townspeople tried to rape them.
###1249 Now Lot,
###1251 not wanting his town to get the reputation
###1254 as the kind of place that would rape angels,
###1257 offered up to the mob his own daughters to rape.
###1261 And he was the good guy in town.
###1264 Which brings me to this question:
###1266 lf l ever had to swear an oath,
###1269 why would l want to put my hand
###1271 on the King James Bible?
###1274 l think l could find more morality in the Rick James Bible.
###1281 God hates fags.
###1283 The Constitution does not grant to homosexuals
###1286 the right to perform sodomy.
###1288 - l'm a monk. - A monk.
###1290 Franciscan.
###1292 What do you think of homosexuality?
###1294 Do you think that's-- the Bible is against it.
###1297 No, the Bible is not against it.
###1298 The Bible's not against homosexuality?
###1300 lf you are born homosexual, you are to stay there.
###1303 - You have to be happy. - But that's what the Bible says?
###1306 What the Bible means to say, yeah.
###1309 Oh, what the Bible means to say!
###1310 Now that's a good book.
###1313 lt preaches the rock-solid truth.
###1315 You are faggots!
###1316 l don't hate them. God hates them.
###1320 - Hey, Bill. - How are you? Nice to meet you.
###1322 Okay. Okay.
###1325 So of course, the reason why we're here is because you're--
###1329 l guess we would say, ex-gay.
###1331 You used to be gay
###1333 and then you married someone who used to be a lesbian.
###1336 And you have three children, and l guess the jury's out on them.
###1341 Okay, and would you say it's just like any other marriage
###1345 of 14 years-- you never have sex?
###1347 Oh, funny. Ha ha. Got that.
###1349 l don't classify myself as ex-gay, you know?
###1353 l'm a heterosexual guy who dealt
###1355 with some homosexuality.
###1359 Okay, so the people who come here are people
###1362 who are wanting to do what you did.
###1364 They want to reform their life and lead a heterosexual life.
###1368 But l will be honest with you. The reality's a lot of people come here
###1371 and go right back into whatever they came from.
###1374 - Because they're gay! - l believe that it's sin.
###1377 Excuse me, but don't you have it, no pun intended, ass-backwards?
###1381 Meaning?
###1383 Meaning homosexuality
###1385 is something that occurs in nature.
###1388 l was out bird watching, but l'd rather watch you.
###1391 Why don't you come over and get some?
###1392 Man is who wrote the Bible.
###1396 Nature made gay people.
###1398 Nobody's born gay. There's no scientific or--
###1401 Really? Have you ever met Little Richard?
###1403 We can look at creation and say, ''What's the normal order?''
###1406 A man has a penis. A woman has a vagina.
###1408 Let's just be blunt.
###1410 There's no scientific data that proves
###1412 that anyone is-- there's no gay gene.
###1415 And you also discovered the gay gene?
###1417 Yes.
###1418 This is all coming from the Bible which you believe...
###1421 - Right. - ...to be the word of God.
###1423 - l do. - All of the proscriptions
###1426 against homosexuality come from the Old Testament.
###1429 Jesus never said a word about homosexuality.
###1432 And if it's so important, why didn't he ever bring it up?
###1434 We could pick lots of little things
###1437 that he didn't specifically talk about.
###1439 - But this is a big thing. - Let me stop this whole thing.
###1442 You know, l'm not sure what your documentary is about,
###1445 but if it's to basically refute the word of God,
###1449 then l'm not interested in doing your interview, okay?
###1452 - Well, l-- - l think that
###1455 obviously you don't have the same relationship
###1457 with Jesus Christ that l do.
###1459 But what is your explanation for the millions and millions of people
###1463 around the world who are
###1464 - leading homosexual lives... - Well, it's not millions.
###1467 ...have no interest in anyone of the opposite sex?
###1471 Are they all faking just to piss off Jesus?
###1473 They didn't choose this. They didn't desire it.
###1476 Right, they were born gay.
###1477 No, they weren't born that way.
###1479 lt's because of the insecurity within theirselves.
###1482 lt takes a lot of security to walk out of the house with assless chaps.
###1486 - They're not happy, most of them. - They're called gay.
###1489 They took the word.
###1491 Some of them look positively thrilled.
###1499 No, they are people who are really not complete
###1501 in who they are as men or women.
###1503 That's a pretty big judgment for a Christian.
###1506 - lt's not a judgment. - That's not a judgment?
###1508 That you are sitting here telling these people
###1510 who you don't even know that they're incomplete
###1513 because they're not like you?
###1514 l mean, it's not the people you suspect
###1517 that are gay, that are gay.
###1519 People like the Reverend Ted Haggard...
###1521 Moral purity is better than immorality.
###1524 ...who kept meeting homosexual prostitutes in a hotel room
###1527 and having gay sex with speed.
###1531 Evangelicals have the best sex life of any other group.
###1535 - Good Morning, Duane! - But he wasn't gay?
###1538 l already answered that.
###1539 l don't believe that anybody is gay.
###1542 l don't know, but honestly, if l just saw you
###1544 in a bar or something, l would say-- and don't take this the wrong way--
###1548 l would say, ''Yeah, l think that guy is gay.''
###1550 You're good looking. You're neat, you know.
###1554 - You don't look like me. - Meaning?
###1556 Meaning...
###1581 - All right, thank you. - Can l give you a hug?
###1583 - Yes! - l hug everybody,
###1584 so can l give you a hug?
###1587 - Thanks. - Thank you very much.
###1589 Hey, you didn't have a hard-on there, did you?
###1591 Nope, sorry. Can't do that.
###1596 That was good, though.
###1598 When l was 17, my first girlfriend dumped me,
###1602 and l was sad in a way l'd never been sad.
###1605 You know, your first dumping is the worst.
###1608 And at that point, you're very vulnerable
###1610 to any sort of connection
###1613 with, you know--
###1615 l didn't get like Jesus-religious,
###1618 but l did think a force out there
###1620 was communicating to me through song lyrics or--
###1623 numerology l was very interested in for a while.
###1627 You said you were groping for something at that time.
###1631 You know, you make up an imaginary friend who loves you,
###1633 is sympathetic to you and has a plan for you.
###1636 lt's much more important. He didn't have to love me, God,
###1639 He just had to be working for me.
###1641 You know, He's like an agent.
###1643 So you are an ex-Jew for Jesus.
###1645 That is correct.
###1647 Now what made you to decide to be a follower of Christ?
###1651 What brought Christ into your life?
###1653 Back in '75,
###1656 l went to Michigan State University.
###1658 - $2,700? - Yeah, it's pricey.
###1662 Boy, l wonder what Madonna without the child runs you.
###1665 So getting back to my story, l could ask God
###1667 to do things in the name of Jesus and they would happen.
###1670 So l can't even recall all the little miracles He did,
###1674 but He proved to me that He was real and He was there.
###1677 They were so miraculous and you can't remember what they were?
###1680 There were so many of them and they were little things.
###1681 - Give me an example. - One example l can remember was
###1684 l was at a party.
###1686 There was a guy who was working with Jews for Jesus,
###1688 and l asked him, ''Can l get a drink of water?''
###1692 And he says, ''You know what? Here's a glass,
###1695 stick your hand out the window and pray for rain.''
###1698 l didn't like the attitude.
###1699 l said okay,
###1701 and l stuck my hand out the window and it started pouring rain.
###1704 Pouring so bad that people couldn't leave the party.
###1708 To me, that's a miracle. You don't have to believe it,
###1710 - but l know between me and God-- - lt is pretty lame.
###1713 - But you asked. - l asked, but l'm just saying
###1716 - that's my reaction to your answer. - But that's just one of many things.
###1719 l live a life of miracles.
###1721 No, you live your life with the same sort of mundane coincidences
###1725 that happen to everybody in the world.
###1727 lt's not like, you know, if it rained frogs,
###1731 l would say you had a point.
###1732 But it rains, and it stops raining.
###1734 Well, when was the last time you asked for rain
###1737 and it starting raining within 10 seconds?
###1738 l don't know. l don't ever ask for rain.
###1740 But if l asked for it really bad and it started to rain,
###1742 l wouldn't think it was because l asked for it.
###1744 l would think because it sometimes rains.
###1746 God is not that busy
###1749 where He can't spend time listening to you
###1751 when you really want to talk to Him, anytime.
###1753 lf Santa Claus can hit every house in the world
###1756 - in one night-- - l don't believe in Santa Claus.
###1758 Of course not, that's ridiculous. That's one man flying
###1761 all around the world and dropping presents down a chimney.
###1763 That's ridiculous. One man hearing everybody murmur
###1766 to him at the same time, that l get.
###1770 And you know what else was very confusing to me?
###1773 l remember vividly
###1775 was Santa Claus
###1778 - and Jesus. - You were so mad at us.
###1780 - Oh, yes. - So mad at you, why? Oh, when--
###1783 When you realized there was no Santa Claus.
###1787 And then when l found out there was no Jesus,
###1789 boy, was l pissed.
###1792 You spoke before in certitude.
###1795 You're 100% sure that after you die,
###1797 you'll go to a better place.
###1799 l know l'll be with God. l'll be with Jesus.
###1802 And that's a better place.
###1804 Even if it was in a garbage can,
###1806 which l know it won't be, but even if it was,
###1808 just the fact that l'm with Jesus, to me, is good.
###1811 - lt's a better place. - lt's a better place.
###1813 Then why don't you kill yourself?
###1817 Because God still has a mission for me here.
###1818 Oh, l see.
###1820 l'm thinking of Jonah. God sent Jonah on a mission.
###1823 When did the part of the story come when Jonah lived in the whale?
###1826 lt was a great fish.
###1828 lt's one of my favorite nonsense stories,
###1830 Jonah living inside of the whale.
###1832 And their answer unfailingly is
###1836 ''The Bible doesn't say whale. lt says big fish.''
###1840 Oh, yeah, big fish, that makes--
###1842 l'm sorry l was obsessing on that it was a whale. lt's a big fish.
###1845 Of course you could live for three days in a big fish.
###1847 A tuna.
###1849 They do it all the time in Japan. They have tuna spas.
###1852 You go for three days. They pamper you, oils.
###1855 You come out of that tuna feeling fantastic.
###1858 You smell like pussy,
###1860 but you feel fantastic.
###1863 This man lived inside of a fish for three days?
###1866 Miraculously, yes.
###1869 Steve, Steve, Steve.
###1872 You don't believe in miracles.
###1873 - That doesn't mean they don't exist. - Of course not!
###1876 l'm not 10!
###1878 He lived in a fish.
###1880 Come on.
###1882 Your bar on miracles is pretty low, l gotta tell you, bro.
###1886 Well, whatever.
###1888 Two things that are completely incompatible
###1890 are Christianity as Jesus taught it
###1894 - and nationalism... - Right. Exactly.
###1896 ...and yet people always say God and country.
###1899 Jesus would never-- you know,
###1902 people who are such good Christians--
###1903 in one breath you'll hear them say something like,
###1906 ''Well, you gotta take care of your own first.
###1908 l know people overseas have trouble, but you gotta take''--
###1911 that is not a message l can ever see the Jesus in the Bible,
###1915 even when he was in a bad mood, would say.
###1922 l'm gonna vote Bible.
###1923 lt's time for God's people to come
###1925 out of the closets, out of the churches
###1928 and change America!
###1930 Unless you and l do what God wants us to do,
###1931 he'll go to some other country.
###1934 God, forgive America!
###1936 l would probably have to say yes, that the Constitution established
###1940 the United States of America as a Christian nation.
###1943 We have, of course, ''ln God We Trust'' on our money.
###1945 The Senate will come to order.
###1947 The chaplain will lead the Senate in prayer.
###1953 How did this country get to be a Christian nation?
###1957 l've read a lot of quotes from all the Founding Fathers.
###1959 There are a lot of quotes that explicitly say
###1961 we're not a Christian nation.
###1975 And Jefferson's a particularly interesting case.
###1978 Didn't he write his own Bible which divorced the New Testament
###1981 from what he considered the unnecessary magic,
###1984 bells and whistles?
###1986 He took the Gospels,
###1988 took out all of Jesus's miracles
###1990 and took out all of Jesus's statements
###1992 that claimed divinity,
###1995 and put out a new book called ''The Faith and Moral Teachings
###1997 of Jesus of Nazareth.''
###1998 We tend to lionize these guys and think of them all
###2001 as the 1 2 Apostles plus the Founding Fathers,
###2005 like they're in the same club or something.
###2007 When in fact, these men understood very well
###2010 that there was a difference between being Christian
###2012 and being American.
###2014 - Right. - ln Jefferson's age, fewer people went
###2016 to church less often.
###2019 Do you think that there are a lot of people
###2021 who feel the way you do, but are afraid to speak out?
###2024 Absolutely. Are you kidding?
###2026 Yes, l think it is the great untapped minority
###2030 in this country.
###2031 ln the last survey,
###2033 l think it was 16% of Americans
###2037 who now say they are absolutely unaffiliated
###2040 with any religion, don't want to be in a religion,
###2042 just don't go near me with religion.
###2044 16% of the population is
###2047 a huge minority. lt's bigger than Jews,
###2050 blacks, homosexuals, NRA members,
###2054 lots of people you could name who have lobbies
###2057 that get everything they want
###2059 or are at least are in the debate.
###2063 You want me to kinda angle like this or straight ahead?
###2065 Just as natural as possible to Bill.
###2067 So you've described yourself as an Evangelical Christian.
###2071 You did a campaign ad where you said the most important lessons in life
###2074 are in this book right here, meaning the Bible.
###2077 Everyone in politics likes to brag that they're a person of faith.
###2081 Why is faith good?
###2084 Faith has a way
###2086 of softening people.
###2088 For example, if you look at the teachings of Jesus, he's very forgiving.
###2091 He also said, ''lf a man doesn't abide in me,
###2093 he is cast forth as a branch and withers,
###2096 and the branches are gathered, thrown into the fire and burned.''
###2100 Right. So?
###2103 l do think, 'cause l'm a Christian,
###2105 that Jesus is the way to be reconciled.
###2108 And l do believe the actual literacy of that story.
###2113 We'll let God sort out all the details of that on Judgment Day.
###2117 What about the 10 Commandments?
###2119 So many politicians talk about the 10 Commandments.
###2122 Are they really the 10 most
###2124 - important moral-- - Are these the 10 suggestions?
###2127 The 10 recommendations?
###2129 But it's not really a wide list of 10.
###2132 The first four are all
###2134 about just worshipping God and basically that he's a jealous God,
###2137 and he doesn't want you to have any other gods.
###2139 The only two that are really laws
###2141 are don't steal and don't kill.
###2144 Why is this the wisest group of 10?
###2146 lt doesn't include child abuse. lt doesn't include don't torture.
###2150 lt doesn't include a lot of things-- rape--
###2152 that l think if we were making a list today,
###2154 we would probably include.
###2156 Society is so different today
###2159 and our culture is so radically different today.
###2161 That's what l'm asking. We're in a different culture.
###2164 Can you think of anything else that we still cleave to from the Bronze Age?
###2167 Well...
###2188 Basically, murder is against the law in every country in the world.
###2191 But wouldn't we have come to that even without religion?
###2194 Don't you think people would have gotten together and said,
###2197 ''You know what? Let's not slaughter each other
###2199 - and not take each other's stuff.'' - l don't know.
###2203 There's been more killing in the name of ''My God.''
###2206 You think maybe sort of indigously
###2209 or just by our DNA,
###2211 we somehow know that killing another person is wrong?
###2214 l'm not sure that that's the case.
###2217 Really, you need God to decide not to kill each other?
###2219 Well, you can look back at more primitive cultures,
###2223 and they were constantly at war.
###2231 We are now, among industrialized, modern nations,
###2234 the most religious nation.
###2237 A recent study found that
###2239 among 32 countries,
###2241 more people in this country doubted evolution
###2243 than any other country on that list, except, l think, it was Turkey.
###2247 ln the US, we have freedom of religion.
###2250 l think most of the countries on that list do have freedom of religion.
###2252 Well, that's interesting.
###2254 Do you believe in evolution?
###2255 You know my-- l don't know.
###2258 Clearly the scientific community's a little divided
###2261 on some of the specifics of that and l understand that.
###2264 - l don't think they are. - No no-- well--
###2267 l think they pretty much agree.
###2269 l don't know how it all happened.
###2271 l'm certainly willing to accept the scientific premise.
###2274 lt couldn't possibly have been Adam and Eve
###2277 5,000 years ago with a talking snake and a garden, could it?
###2280 Well, it could've possibly been that.
###2282 Come on. See, this is my problem.
###2284 l mean, you're a senator.
###2287 You are one of the very few people
###2289 who are really running this country.
###2291 lt worries me that people are running my country who think--
###2295 who believe in a talking snake.
###2296 You don't have to pass an lQ test to be in the Senate, though.
###2309 As you first come into the Creation Museum,
###2312 there's going to be a sense
###2313 of ''This is something really big.''
###2315 This is something awe-inspiring, something great here.
###2318 We can answer the questions of the skeptics
###2321 that attack the Bible's history.
###2322 We admit that we start from the Bible here
###2325 to teach them how to think.
###2327 Really, in a nutshell, we're saying, the Bible's true
###2329 from Genesis to Revelation.
###2336 We're building the whole place for about $27 million.
###2341 l have many people say to me,
###2342 ''As a Christian, can't you believe in evolution?''
###2344 l say, ''Well, you got a problem. God made a man and a woman.''
###2347 lf you believe in evolution, the woman had to come from an ape woman.
###2350 All right, but you're so damned ugly.
###2355 This is what we call the main hall here. lmmediately, people see
###2359 dinosaurs and people together, which is very different
###2361 to the idea of the evolutionists who say dinosaurs died out
###2365 70 million ago or so, and so they didn't live with humans.
###2368 They see an animatronic dinosaur over here.
###2371 Two animatronic baby T-Rexes and two animatronic children.
###2374 lt's basically just to give people a wow factor as they come in here.
###2381 How to share your faith effectively and Biblically,
###2385 to be able to reason with people,
###2387 learn to circumnavigate
###2388 or go around the person's intellect.
###2390 There's plenty of people who would say, ''Well, it's just my faith.''
###2394 But that's not good enough for you. You say, ''No.
###2397 We can basically reconcile the science
###2399 with what's in Genesis.''
###2402 We're an organization that-- to put it in a nutshell--
###2405 is telling people that the Bible's history is true,
###2408 its history beginning in Genesis.
###2409 Scientists line up overwhelmingly
###2412 on one side of this issue. lt would have to be
###2415 an enormous conspiracy going on between scientists
###2418 of all different disciplines in all different countries
###2421 to have such a consensus.
###2424 That doesn't move you?
###2425 No, not at all, because from a Biblical perspective,
###2428 l understand why the majority would not agree with the truth.
###2431 Man is a sinner. Man is rebelling against his creator.
###2434 All these scientists are sinners?
###2437 Well...
###2439 We have been talking to so many religious people
###2442 and many of them believe the earth is 5,000 years old.
###2445 lf you're a scientist, you can't accept that.
###2447 Now you recently were the director of the Vatican Observatory.
###2451 A Vatican astronomer.
###2453 lt's one of those terms like ''gay Republican''--
###2456 you know, you just don't expect it.
###2458 - l'm not getting into that. - No no no, l'm not asking you to.
###2461 lt's not that the church has the idea, you know,
###2464 they're gonna train us up so we can be the first ones out there
###2467 to baptize those extraterrestrials
###2469 before the Mormons get at 'em.
###2471 The reason is simply
###2474 historical facts.
###2476 John Paul ll, for instance, said evolution
###2480 in the neo-Darwinian sense is no longer a mere hypothesis.
###2484 l mean, he said that. lt's in writing.
###2486 l still don't understand why it's important
###2489 for there to have to have been a situation on earth
###2491 where a man co-existed with dinosaurs.
###2494 Only really in ''The Flintstones''...
###2495 ls someone talking about me?
###2497 ...and that Raquel Welch movie
###2499 does man ever co-exist with dinosaurs.
###2503 Why is that important for your salvation or your morality?
###2506 lf you're saying this part over here,
###2508 it says God made land animals and man on the same day is not true,
###2511 then ultimately, why should l believe this bit over here?
###2514 The Christian Scriptures were written
###2518 between about 2,000 years before Christ
###2521 to about 200 years after Christ.
###2523 That's it.
###2524 Modern science came to be with Galileo
###2528 up through Newton, up through Einstein.
###2530 What we know as modern science, okay,
###2533 is in that period.
###2535 How in the world could there be any science
###2538 in scripture?
###2540 There cannot be.
###2542 Just the two historical periods are separated
###2544 by so much.
###2546 The Scriptures are not
###2548 teaching science.
###2550 lt's very hard for me to accept,
###2552 not just a literal interpretation of scripture,
###2556 but a fundamentalist approach to religious belief.
###2559 lt's kind of a plague.
###2560 lt presents itself as science and it's not.
###2563 God is an infinite God who is working in ways
###2566 - we don't always understand. - You don't think that's a cop-out?
###2568 He is God.
###2571 Are you God?
###2574 No.
###2579 We went to church every Sunday.
###2581 My sister and l went to Catechism, which is Catholic, you know,
###2585 like Hebrew school for papists.
###2588 lt was like war.
###2590 lt was vast stretches of boredom punctuated
###2593 by moments of sheer terror.
###2601 l'm in the Vatican.
###2609 Buongiorno!
###2611 l know what you're thinking. l'm standing in front of a green screen
###2614 at a studio in Burbank, California,
###2616 and they digitalized the Vatican in behind me.
###2618 No no, that's really the Vatican.
###2621 l ought to know. l just got thrown out of it.
###2623 See, l wanted to interview the Pope,
###2625 but l was willing to settle for a cardinal or a monsignor
###2629 or the Flying Nun-- really anybody--
###2631 but apparently l've been on the Catholic shit list for quite a while.
###2634 But that's their loss, 'cause now l'm gonna say what l really think,
###2638 which is mainly:
###2640 Does that look anything
###2641 like anything Jesus Christ had in mind?
###2644 When you look at a building like that, a giant palace,
###2647 does it seem at odds with the message of the founder?
###2650 Well, certainly.
###2651 - Well, thank you. - l mean, that's obvious.
###2655 lt really is obvious, isn't it? But does it bother you?
###2658 Well, l mean-- well, yes it does.
###2662 l wouldn't-- if l were the boss,
###2664 l wouldn't be living there.
###2666 l mean Jesus would be probably out in some barracks here
###2669 in a suburb of Rome, got it?
###2672 Do you ever get so fed up you want to take the collar and go...
###2675 - Well, l don't wear a collar anyway. - ...''That's it, Captain.
###2677 Take my badge and my collar.''
###2679 l read about 10 books recently-- the rationality of religion,
###2683 and everyone's saying it's stupid.
###2687 You know what's gonna happen to them.
###2689 - No, what's gonna happen? - They're gonna be roasting in hell.
###2690 Come on, roasting. That's the old Catholic thing.
###2693 That's what they taught me.
###2694 Yeah, l know, that hell business.
###2696 Well, come on, the standard doctrine that l was taught as a kid--
###2699 Yeah, that's all gone. That's all finished.
###2701 But that's not fair.
###2703 - Yeah, pfft! - The date of Jesus's birth
###2706 really wasn't established until 349 A.D.
###2709 Oh, yeah...
###2711 because he might've been born on July 3rd.
###2714 These are all nice stories, you know.
###2717 - And that doesn't bother you, either? - That bothers me too.
###2719 l mean, when everybody's, ''Ooh, we have to have midnight mass
###2722 because Jesus was born on midnight on 25th of''--
###2725 this is all nonsense.
###2727 - You're a maverick, aren't you? - l'm not a maverick.
###2729 You're Father Maverick. You do things your own way.
###2738 When you add up all the saints and all the angels
###2741 and archangels and super-duper angels--
###2743 there's God, the Father, God the Son, the Holy Ghost,
###2746 Mother Mary-- it does start to look like
###2749 it's not quite the monotheistic religion that it's--
###2752 Oh, l understand. Like we have mini-gods.
###2754 Yeah, well, it does seem like that, if people pray to a--
###2758 Well, yeah, but some people just don't understand this.
###2760 You probably are-- you don't follow things--
###2763 but they had a survey here in ltaly, you know,
###2765 and they said, ''ln a crisis,
###2767 what kind of saints do you pray to?'' Got it?
###2770 You know who's the sixth on the list? Jesus Christ.
###2773 The sixth?
###2775 He's the sixth man that the ltalians call upon
###2778 when they have problems. lsn't that neat?
###2781 - That's very interesting. - Talk about Cafeteria Catholics. Pfft!
###2785 So how do you convince people of what's the true faith?
###2787 You don't, forget it. You just have to live and die
###2790 with their stupid ideas.
###2793 l'm sorry. What are you gonna do?
###2795 You can go to a pitch meeting at a movie studio and go,
###2797 ''Okay, there's a spaceman
###2800 who zaps a virgin
###2802 and he gives birth to a son who's also him,
###2805 who then goes on a suicide mission.''
###2806 l wonder what people would say about that.
###2808 Yeah, that is actually a great pitch.
###2810 lt has so many elements that they like,
###2812 because they love suicide missions.
###2814 They love violence, and Hollywood loves something
###2817 it's never seen before-- a virgin.
###2837 Hey, Shalom.
###2844 We're so glad to have you here. Just come and get blessed.
###2854 These are here to teach God's word.
###2856 We're in a spiritual warfare.
###2858 We don't push our beliefs on people,
###2860 but we do make them available.
###2862 - Have you ever had a Muslim person? - Yes, definitely.
###2865 People from Gaza Strip come.
###2870 We get many people who come here say,
###2872 ''We've come every year to Florida
###2874 and we've done the tourist things and all and we enjoy those.
###2877 We wish we had seen this first,''
###2881 because their experience here was so meaningful.
###2884 Do you think if-- when you were a kid--
###2887 they transposed the Bible stories
###2890 with the fairy tales, you'd know the difference as an adult?
###2894 - My name is Eve. - l'm Adam.
###2897 This place is amazing.
###2899 lf they told you Jack and the Beanstalk was religion
###2901 and that a man who lived in a whale was in a fairy-tale book...
###2906 you think when you got to be an adult,
###2908 you'd be defending the one instead of the other?
###2910 So you're saying that the Bible's a fairy tale?
###2912 God took my rib like this
###2915 and began to whittle it
###2917 like this
###2919 and blow on it... and then--
###2923 Saved means believing in Jesus Christ
###2925 - as the only begotten Son of God. - Not for me, it don't.
###2927 What about the Muslims?
###2929 Many Muslims are saved right now.
###2931 l don't get it.
###2933 l pray in your lifetime you do.
###2935 Jesus came through a Jew. He was not the seed of man.
###2939 He came through a Jewish woman,
###2941 but no man had ever touched her.
###2943 No flesh had ever touched her.
###2945 He was the seed of God.
###2966 You want me to lean up against the tomb or something
###2968 or you want casual or-- okay.
###2971 Did l give you my cell phone?
###2972 Oh, l left my cell phone, right? Just want to make sure.
###2975 Testing one two, check, testing.
###2977 How you doing, Bill? God bless you.
###2979 - Hi. - Seen you around.
###2981 - Welcome to our world. - l've seen you around.
###2983 Now is this your tomb? ls this a real rock?
###2986 No, it's just cement. They just kind of cemented it in there.
###2989 So when you go out to dinner, people recognize you?
###2992 All the time, yeah.
###2993 l think you get a little bit of that, too.
###2996 But they don't think l'm the Lord. You must really be--
###2999 Why do you think people come here? 'Cause Disneyland's too smutty?
###3002 l personally haven't been to the Holy Land,
###3004 so this was an awesome experience for me when l walked on the property.
###3006 - l was like, ''Wow, this is cool.'' - Let me ask you questions
###3009 - about your business... - Yes.
###3011 ...or really the Jesus business. God is super powerful.
###3014 - He can do anything. - Sure.
###3016 Why doesn't he just obliterate the devil
###3019 and therefore get rid of evil in the world?
###3023 - He will. - He will? What's he waiting for?
###3025 - End times. - But why play it out like that?
###3027 - Why make it a game? - Well, it's not necessarily a game.
###3030 A day is like a thousand years in God's eyes, it says in the Bible.
###3033 lf you wanna look at it-- just like two days ago, Christ died.
###3035 But l know that he is so far beyond any of our ways,
###3039 that he can work the worst situation for his good.
###3041 What was the Holocaust? Why was that good?
###3044 You know, God had a plan for that. Maybe it's to cause--
###3046 l wonder if you would have thought that if you were one of the people
###3048 - being pushed into an oven. - Well, you know what?
###3050 lt's like trying to explain to an ant how a TV works.
###3052 That's-- God's ways are so much higher than ours.
###3055 There's no way you can understand that.
###3058 We need to stop the interview for just a moment, please.
###3060 - Nice to see you. - Senior manager of public relations.
###3061 - Hi, Les, l'll be right with you. - Hi. Sure.
###3073 l'm not afraid of the piranha women.
###3075 When he came, he said, ''l come not to abolish the law, but to fulfill it.''
###3078 You boil all those Levitical laws down to two things:
###3080 No other God is before me, Bill,
###3082 and love the Lord with all your heart.
###3084 But, Jesus, having no other gods before you,
###3086 that's not moral. There's nothing moral about that.
###3088 lt's just something a jealous god would do.
###3091 lt does say that our God is a jealous god.
###3093 But your God is jealous? That seems so unGodlike
###3097 that God would have such a petty human emotion.
###3099 l know people who have gotten over jealousy,
###3102 - let alone God. - There's two sides to the coin.
###3104 He's a just God and he's also a merciful God.
###3106 No, he spends the first five books of the Bible wiping out people.
###3110 That's what he chose to do. His ways are higher than ours, Bill.
###3114 - Maybe our thinking should be higher. - That's a good point.
###3116 God has got this God-sized hole in your life.
###3119 You can fit that with any position--
###3121 drugs, sex, whatever you want-- it is not gonna fill it.
###3124 - Can l try? - You can try all you want.
###3125 You're gonna end up hurting yourself,
###3127 damaging yourself and burning yourself up.
###3128 l thought Christ was about not judging people.
###3131 - That's true. - lsn't that a judgment there?
###3133 You don't know me and you're telling me l need to fill a hole in my heart
###3136 - with drugs and sex. - No, l'm not talking about you.
###3138 l'm saying anyone in general.
###3139 See, if l was God, l would create people without the hole to begin with.
###3142 Have you ever had a little voice in the back of your mind say something?
###3146 - We've all had that. - That's called the Holy Spirit.
###3148 - That's not God. That's you. - That's called the Holy Spirit.
###3150 - Feel this wind right now? - Yeah.
###3152 Okay, where is it? You don't know, right?
###3154 - Yeah, it's called wind. - Okay, that's like the Holy Spirit.
###3157 lt's a monotheistic religion, but there's three of them.
###3160 Just like water can be ice, steam and water.
###3162 l see.
###3164 lt's different forms, different shapes for the different purposes.
###3166 The analogy that Jesus at the amusement park
###3168 said yesterday was brilliant,
###3170 about the Trinity is like water.
###3173 lt can be steam. lt can be ice.
###3175 lt can be liquid. Wow, that is--
###3178 boy, that stopped me in my tracks for a second, you know?
###3181 That's just a brilliant analogy.
###3183 When you think about it for two minutes,
###3184 it's still complete bullshit.
###3187 There this space God and he's himself
###3189 and he sent himself on a suicide mission.
###3191 He's a God, but he has a kid. He's a single parent.
###3194 lt's just silly, but when you put it in the water analogy,
###3198 l can see that, you know, those ladies there,
###3201 when they heard that the first time, they were like, done.
###3203 Sold. Oh, you had me at ice cube.
###3207 Moving on. Does it ever bother you
###3209 that the story of a man
###3213 who was born of a virgin was resurrected?
###3216 Your bio was something that was going around the Mediterranean
###3219 for at least 1,000 years.
###3221 We've got Krishna who was in lndia
###3224 1,000 years before Christ. Krishna was a carpenter,
###3227 born of a virgin, baptized in a river.
###3229 Are you saying that was written in history?
###3231 That was written down in history, is that what you're saying?
###3233 Absolutely, there's the Persian god Mithra, 600 years before Christ.
###3237 Born December 25th, performed miracles,
###3239 resurrected on the third day,
###3241 known as the Lamb, the Way, the Truth, the Light, the Savior, Messiah.
###3245 Stop! Blasphemer!
###3247 All l know is that l don't go by that hearsay.
###3249 l go by the word of God. l know that's why l believe.
###3253 - Well, l believe it because it's truth. - Believe it, yes.
###3255 But there's a difference between truth and what you believe.
###3258 ln the Bible it tells us that all things are possible with God, okay?
###3261 Study the religions of the Mediterranean region
###3264 for a thousand years before.
###3265 Many of the gods were born on December 25th.
###3269 - No, it's not. - lt's not a new one.
###3272 lt's funny you should bring that up because of course
###3274 in ''Star Wars: Episode l-- The Phantom Menace,''
###3276 Anakin is born to a virgin.
###3277 People see that and say, ''Wait a second.
###3279 Where have we heard that before?'' That's not original.
###3281 - But the Jesus story wasn't original. - How so?
###3334 Let me ask you a question. Let's say, if you take the side
###3337 - that this is all made up... - l do.
###3340 ...what if you're wrong?
###3343 What if you're wrong?
###3355 # Down the Via Dolorosa #
###3359 # ln Jerusalem that day #
###3363 # The soldiers tried #
###3365 # To clear the narrow street #
###3370 # But the crowd pressed in to see #
###3374 # The man condemned to die #
###3376 # On Calvary #
###3381 # Down the Via Dolorosa #
###3384 # Called the Way of Suffering #
###3388 # Like a lamb came the Messiah #
###3391 # Christ the King #
###3395 # And he chose to walk that road #
###3398 # Out of his love #
###3401 # For you #
###3403 # And me. #
###3427 Was Jesus a sinner?
###3429 One master. One word. l am your master.
###3435 Who do we put away in the asylums?
###3446 Xenu brought us here
###3448 75 million years ago,
###3450 stacked us around volcanoes
###3453 and blew them up with an H-bomb.
###3459 We are older than the universe.
###3464 You have to rid yourself
###3467 of the implants
###3468 from the extraterrestrial dictators!
###3475 - Get an E-Meter. Yes, get an E-Meter! - An E-meter?
###3482 Audit yourself.
###3487 How do you people expect to get to the next level?
###3493 l'm not making the rules.
###3497 Aw...
###3501 You know, Scientologists...
###3506 And right, you're like, ''Oh, yeah, that's some crazy shit. Okay.
###3510 Jesus with the virgin birth and the dove and the snake
###3513 who talked in the garden, that's cool.
###3517 But the Scientologists, they're the crazy ones.''
###3520 That's not true.
###3521 That-- that-- l don't have any idea
###3523 of what you're talking about.
###3526 But it has something to do with making sure
###3528 that we're born with a defect,
###3530 so that the souls of ours
###3532 are infected with aliens...
###3534 Thank you.
###3537 ...because the cure? Scientology.
###3541 They're all crazy. Yes, the religions do get even crazier.
###3544 They have to to keep up.
###3547 They keep raising the bar. After you've done the virgin birth,
###3549 you know, where do you go?
###3568 We're not getting the top?
###3570 - We got the top. - Oh, okay.
###3572 That's the Mormon Temple behind me.
###3574 To be a Mormon is to believe some really crazy stuff,
###3577 crazy even by the standards of the big religions.
###3580 When you're the new kid on the block--
###3583 Thank you. That was helpful.
###3586 You're the new kid on the block
###3588 and all the good crazy has already been picked over,
###3590 so you kind of have to up the ante.
###3592 Oh.
###3594 God damn it.
###3596 Not while l'm in the middle of it.
###3600 Well, we do have it.
###3603 Boy, a lot of people came
###3604 - out of the woodwork. - Yeah.
###3611 So did you guys get anybody from the church to talk to?
###3613 Well, if you count getting thrown off the property
###3616 - ''talked to.'' - That's probably better.
###3619 We'd like you to ''Meet the Mormons.''
###3623 ln the founding scripture, you open up the Doctrine of Covenants,
###3625 you read the autobiography of Joseph Smith.
###3627 He quotes Jesus Christ as telling him
###3631 that every other creed on earth is, quote,
###3633 ''an abomination.'' An abomination.
###3635 l mean, that's not a very ecumenical statement.
###3637 You're talking about things that, l think, at some level
###3641 you sense just do not make sense.
###3643 l'm glad you said that because l read some of the tenets of Mormonism,
###3646 like ''God lives on a planet near the star of Kalob.''
###3650 - Kolob. - Kolob.
###3651 God the Father who's a physical man with a body of flesh and bone
###3654 is probably about 6' tall, lives on a place called Kolob,
###3658 had sexual relations with Mary-- remember he's a man.
###3661 ''Jesus Christ was conceived by God the father
###3664 having actual sex with Mary.''
###3666 Mary said, ''lf this is what God wants,
###3668 l'll be glad to do His will.''
###3670 ''Dark skin is a curse from God,
###3672 but if you're sufficiently righteous,
###3674 a dark-skinned person
###3675 can become light-skinned.''
###3677 According to the Book of Mormon,
###3680 after his resurrection, Jesus came to the Americas
###3682 to preach to the lndians.
###3684 ''That American lndians are actually a lost tribe of lsrael.''
###3687 They're lost Jews.
###3691 And also the idea
###3692 that Christianity is American,
###3695 l think, is an amazing entitlement to a people
###3697 who are always trying to meld God and country.
###3701 The Garden of Eden was in Missouri according to Mormonism.
###3705 The new Jerusalem will be there.
###3706 Branson, l'm hoping.
###3708 l've also heard that the Mormon Church baptizes dead people.
###3711 You can be baptized for about 50 people,
###3714 100 people that've died.
###3716 And so you just get dunked about 50 to 100 times.
###3718 That's baptism for the dead.
###3720 Caffeine is evil. That magic underwear can protect you.
###3731 And that you need a secret password to get into heaven.
###3734 Everyone must stand at the final judgment
###3736 before Joseph Smith, Jesus and Elohim.
###3739 This isn't an easy religion.
###3741 Why do you think it is that so few people
###3744 do what you have done and leave the church?
###3746 The moment you acknowledge to yourself that Joseph Smith
###3748 did not tell the truth about his experiences and his achievements,
###3752 you just committed social suicide.
###3755 - Family and friends... - Family and friends.
###3757 ...will-- you're off the deep end.
###3759 Dr. Andrew Newberg, nice to meet you.
###3763 l've finally met someone who's studied... neurotheology.
###3767 This is getting very close to something l always say,
###3769 which is that religion is a neurological disorder.
###3773 What does the brain look like when it's hopped up on God?
###3775 We see a lot of different colors, which help us to--
###3778 tell us what the activity is in the brain
###3779 and what we have found is that there are some very specific changes
###3782 when people are actually meditating or praying
###3785 or even speaking in tongues, which was our last study.
###3787 ln the name of Jesus,
###3790 you've been made whole by the power of God.
###3793 - Speaking in tongues? - We studied people speaking in tongues.
###3795 They're just babbling, though, right?
###3800 They're not really speaking in a language they don't know.
###3802 lt's not an actual language, but what's--
###3805 Just bullshit, Doc, come on.
###3807 lsn't that something?
###3822 l love you.
###3824 So you would agree that even if a billion people
###3827 believe something, it can still be ridiculous?
###3830 - Absolutely. - But the Jews, l mean, they're--
###3832 excuse me, Jewish friends-- but they're as cuckoo as anybody,
###3835 especially the really Orthodox ones.
###3837 You are one of the few Jewish people in the world
###3841 who does not believe in the state of lsrael.
###3843 You do not think the state
###3844 - of lsrael should exist. - Correct.
###3848 - Okay. - God gave us the land of lsrael.
###3850 On Mount Sinai where we made this bond with God,
###3854 He said, ''l'm giving you the land, but l'm stipulating--
###3856 very clearly stipulating-- you must be on a certain level of holiness.''
###3860 You will see it clearly that we were sent out of the land.
###3862 So basically you're saying that
###3864 the Jewish people have not been holy enough
###3866 to deserve the land of lsrael.
###3868 God understands what is good for us, what is bad for us...
###3870 - First of all-- - ...what will bring us safety or not.
###3872 Let me just finish.
###3873 God told us, though, if you will go against God--
###3875 - God manipulates the world-- - Okay, l--
###3878 Wait a second. Let me finish this.
###3880 God said if you're going to try to make the state,
###3882 you will be unsuccessful.
###3884 You are looking through--
###3885 you're trying to look at this world through a keyhole.
###3888 l'm looking through the key--
###3890 Let me finish. God is compassionate.
###3893 Everything is directly from God, we believe.
###3895 - But it seems to me-- - l'll now explain what you're asking.
###3898 The concept of saying
###3900 that we've suffered enough anti-Semitism--
###3903 Never again.
###3904 So you don't say ''Never again.'' You say ''Again.''
###3907 Yeah. Let us understand that the Jewish people
###3910 were living in exile for 2,000 years
###3912 under God's protection
###3914 and we were living in Western civilization--
###3916 - Germany, Poland. Not anymore... - Let me finish.
###3918 We were living amongst all nations throughout the years.
###3920 ...'cause they're all dead. How many people died in the Holocaust?
###3922 You're jumping. Let's jump to the Holocaust.
###3926 l thought the issue was Jewish safety.
###3928 l thought the issue was how many Jews are dying.
###3931 So let's talk about Jewish safety.
###3933 Okay, l'm sure there was a few--
###3935 A couple million Jews died, that's okay, that's the wording you use?
###3938 You're the one who went to lran in December 2006
###3942 for the president
###3944 of that country's Holocaust ''denial'' conference.
###3947 Whoa, don't just throw words.
###3960 Why does Ahmadinejad say that he wants lsrael
###3963 - to be wiped from the face of the-- - When did he say that?
###3965 - He did. - He never said that.
###3967 What did he say? What was the exact quote?
###3968 - He said it should disappear. - What, is he David Copperfield?
###3973 - That's chutzpah. - Never again, Rabbi, never again.
###3976 Wait. One more second.
###3978 No, l'm out.
###3982 We have Conservatives. We have Reforms.
###3984 We have the Orthodox.
###3985 You are an observing Jew.
###3988 lt says it right there in the fourth commandment:
###3990 Honor the Sabbath day to keep it holy.
###3992 Friday night to Saturday night, you don't do anything.
###3995 Yeah, the rabbis over the centuries have created these prohibitions
###3999 as a way to try to protect the day of rest.
###4002 You can't use electricity. You can't drive.
###4006 Let's talk a little about keeping the Sabbath holy.
###4009 l've always wondered if it came about
###4012 because God rested on the Sabbath
###4015 and that's why man has to.
###4017 That's right, and that was the creation
###4019 of the seventh day, that there should be rest.
###4021 There are 39 types of specific actions
###4024 that cannot be done on the Sabbath.
###4027 One of them is lighting a fire.
###4029 Planting. Another one is plowing.
###4030 Another one is tying a knot, untying a knot.
###4032 One is building, and one is destroying so as to build.
###4035 So much more kosher is to develop these gadgets
###4038 - that figure out a way around it. - That's right.
###4041 lt does seem that you are, to a degree,
###4043 trying to outsmart God.
###4046 lf the lawmaker never makes a mistake,
###4049 and still there's a loophole there, why is that loophole there?
###4053 To be used in a situation of need.
###4055 But how did this get updated
###4058 for a 4,000-year-old rule?
###4059 lt seems there's an awful lot
###4061 that has to do with electricity.
###4063 Rabbi Halperin's work here is translating it
###4065 into something more modern.
###4070 Let's look at some of the gadgets you have.
###4072 l'm particularly interested in the phone. ls there not a cell phone?
###4075 lt's not a cell phone.
###4077 Okay, wow.
###4079 l have to say, that looks modern.
###4083 Each number is trying to dial itself all the time.
###4088 Hello. Hello.
###4091 When l take the stick
###4093 - and l put it into the hole... - Hello.
###4096 ...l'm inhibiting that which is inhibiting
###4098 the number from dialing itself.
###4101 Let me ask about this. lt's obviously a wheelchair.
###4104 - May l? - Sure.
###4108 Oh, wow.
###4111 And this is not the new model, l'm guessing.
###4113 - This is the experimental prototype. - l see.
###4115 Schmuck!
###4118 - This runs on air pressure, right? - Correct.
###4121 Basically, we've got 150 atmospheres
###4124 of pressure here.
###4126 We've got the turning it on, turning it off here.
###4128 So air is okay.
###4130 - Air good. Fire bad. - Fire bad.
###4133 Fire bad!
###4136 We've taken an old bicycle--
###4140 - l forgot what it's called. - Tire.
###4142 Okay. Air goes in, air goes out.
###4146 lf l was a person in that wheelchair,
###4147 l might say to myself, ''Why am l going to these lengths
###4150 to please God, who's taken away my legs to begin with?''
###4154 Okay.
###4157 That would be fascinating. lt's an elevator.
###4160 Oh, it's a Shabbatavator.
###4162 Let me guess, you can't push a button...
###4164 - Correct. - ...on the Sabbath.
###4166 The issues behind the scenes that people don't see are the real problems.
###4170 An even bigger problem might be how do you get someone
###4172 to put this in their building if they're not completely nuts?
###4176 Well, actually, that really doesn't make a difference.
###4179 Hmm.
###4180 How we define what is crazy or not crazy
###4182 about religions is ultimately up to how we define crazy.
###4187 lf you define mental illness as anyone who hears a voice
###4190 talking to them, then anyone who has heard the voice of God is crazy.
###4211 She talks about a prophecy
###4213 that these children needed to die.
###4218 The dispatcher asked ''Why did you do this?''
###4221 ''l was told to.'' ''Who told you?'' ''God.''
###4227 There is nothing
###4229 He may not ask of thee?
###4233 But in layman's terms, Jesus was nuts.
###4235 Moses-- ''Stay here, l'm going up
###4237 and getting the 10 Commandments right from God.''
###4240 You know, 'cause one thing l've also--
###4242 We didn't have brain-scan technology back then, so it's a hard to tell.
###4244 l know, but if a guy says he went up on a mountain and he talked to God,
###4247 and He talked to him through a burning bush,
###4249 that guy's a cuckoo.
###4269 All those pastors who refer to me
###4272 as the anti-Christ, false prophet,
###4275 it's because they're miserable.
###4277 Anyone who doesn't believe in me is miserable.
###4287 - My mike is on? - Yes, sir.
###4289 Okay, who are you Biblically?
###4292 l am Jesus Christ man, the second coming of Christ, l am.
###4296 The Old Testament speaks about me clearly
###4299 and the New Testament also.
###4301 - About you personally? - Yes.
###4303 Not just because you have-- you share the name Jesus?
###4306 - No, not because of that. - You also share the name Miranda.
###4309 Maybe you're Carmen Miranda.
###4311 Maybe the second coming of her?
###4313 You should have fruit on your head, instead of fruit in your head.
###4318 Okay. Fuck you. How's that?
###4320 Why do you think God chose you?
###4324 Jesus of Nazareth had a wife
###4327 so after they killed him,
###4330 his seed kept going, maybe through France, Spain,
###4334 and then from Spain, came to Puerto Rico.
###4339 The bloodline come from Abraham, Abraham to David,
###4342 David to Jesus of Nazareth,
###4344 Jesus of Nazareth, me.
###4347 Okay, l though a second coming
###4349 was the reincarnation
###4352 of the Christ himself,
###4354 not a descendant of.
###4356 No, he's a descendant.
###4358 Descendant? Oh... but you don't believe in hell?
###4362 - No. - Or the Devil?
###4364 - No. - Or even sin, right?
###4366 No, there's not a sin any longer.
###4368 What you teach is that Jesus died for our sins
###4372 and so there's not really any sinning anymore.
###4376 - No more sin. - This is like a diet doctor saying,
###4380 - ''Eat anything you want.'' - Right.
###4381 ''You don't lose weight, but it's easy to stick to.''
###4384 That's what l believe, Bill.
###4385 Oh, l know you do.
###4387 And l have many people who believe in this.
###4389 And yet, you have a little-- you have a little twinkle
###4391 in your eye when say it.
###4393 No, l believe in that. l believe.
###4397 How do we know? Because lots of people would like this job.
###4401 How do you get this job as the second coming?
###4402 lt's not on Craigslist.
###4404 - Yeah. - l'm guessing. Maybe it is.
###4407 See, two angels--
###4408 Two guys named Angel, Spanish guys.
###4411 You know what l'm talking about,
###4413 you fucking cockroach!
###4416 - No. - Oh, actual angels.
###4418 - Two angels came to me... - Okay.
###4420 ...and they told me
###4422 ''The Lord of Lords and King of Kings
###4425 is coming to anoint you for the ministry tonight.''
###4428 What form did the angels come in? How tall?
###4431 Little tall and strong.
###4433 Whatever they told me, l obey.
###4434 l don't wanna mess with them.
###4437 But l'm just saying,
###4438 it seems that if God wanted
###4441 to communicate something to the world--
###4443 He's all powerful--
###4445 He would just talk to the whole world.
###4448 lt always seems He picks out a prophet in private
###4452 and tells them, ''Okay, you're the prophet.''
###4455 - l am. - ''You go tell the rest of the world.''
###4457 So we just sort of have to take it on faith.
###4459 We just sort of have to believe you.
###4461 Right, yeah, it's true.
###4467 Abraham. Noah.
###4470 Lord, what shall l do?
###4472 Moses,
###4474 climb the mount alone.
###4476 Once again, the Lord had spoken to Joseph Smith
###4479 as he had to Adam, Abraham,
###4482 Moses, Paul and others.
###4486 l am the first Christian.
###4488 And the rest are really kind of Jewish, you're saying,
###4491 because they're following a Jew.
###4493 That's it.
###4495 ln fact, they put on the plates--
###4497 they say ''My boss is a Jewish carpenter.''
###4500 How ridiculous is that? A Jewish carpenter!
###4503 - lmagine. - Come on, Jews hire carpenters.
###4506 They don't--
###4508 you know, people say ''l found my calling in life.''
###4511 And it's a good calling. lt's a nice living.
###4513 People adore you. Everywhere you go,
###4516 they treat you like Christ, like you're the Messiah.
###4518 You know, if l discovered that l was Satan in person,
###4522 l would do a good job, too,
###4524 because l would be faithful to my calling.
###4526 lt's how you do your work, isn't it?
###4529 You know, at the end of the day, whether you're the Messiah
###4531 or you're Satan, it's loving what you do
###4533 and giving it 100%.
###4535 l give 100%.
###4537 l wasn't born skeptical.
###4541 l was still making deals with ''God'' when l was 40.
###4544 l remember l quit smoking.
###4546 There was some shitty problem l had in my life,
###4548 and l made a deal with God,
###4550 ''Okay, if you make this problem go away,
###4552 l will quit smoking, and l won't go back on it
###4555 'cause l'd know l'd be going back on a deal with God.''
###4558 And you know, l gotta say,
###4560 l'm kind of glad l had ''God''
###4562 in my life.
###4564 You are the head
###4566 of the First Universal Church of Cantheism...
###4571 - Yes. - ...which is really built around
###4574 - this substance here. - No.
###4576 No? Okay, l got that wrong.
###4579 But it's built around smoking this.
###4582 l mean, it has no dogma, right?
###4584 You're not preaching to anybody. You're not saying
###4586 - you'll save their souls, no rituals. - No.
###4588 How does this differ from just getting wasted?
###4590 l mean that in the best possible way, but--
###4593 l understand the concept of God,
###4595 a feeling of one with everything else.
###4598 Do you feel that every time you smoke pot?
###4601 No.
###4603 Phew! l thought it was just me.
###4605 So why do you think it's this family of drugs
###4609 that's so good for opening our minds
###4612 as opposed to ludes, PCP,
###4614 or smashing up your mother's diet pills and smoking 'em in a pipe?
###4619 l don't know. l don't know.
###4625 So l did want to get your thoughts
###4627 about what's going on in this city. This is your city.
###4630 There's a lot of controversy with--
###4633 maybe the Dutch are so tolerant
###4635 that they're now tolerating intolerance.
###4638 There's a lot of tension with the Muslim community.
###4641 lt's all religious fundamentalists.
###4644 They already killed Theo Van Gogh,
###4646 who was a known television maker.
###4650 This is the spot where Theo Van Gogh
###4653 - was assassinated? - This is exactly the spot.
###4656 He was a Dutch filmmaker. He made a 10-minute film.
###4659 lt was deeply offensive to Muslims.
###4662 Oh, Allah, you say that men are the protectors
###4666 and maintainers of women
###4668 because you have given the one more strength than the other.
###4670 l feel at least once a week,
###4672 the strength of my husband's fist
###4675 on my face.
###4677 Lots of people think that free speech
###4679 goes right up to this point and then when you're talking about religion,
###4684 when you're talking about the Prophet, all bets are off.
###4688 lt goes both ways, freedom of speech.
###4690 lt goes both ways, but the people who actually--
###4692 usually do the killing for it wind up on the Muslim side.
###4696 Do you think that says something about the different cultures?
###4699 l don't want to have the image of the Muslims,
###4702 you know, if they don't like something you say,
###4703 they kill you, because it's not.
###4706 lt was a noisy crowd outside the Danish embassy in London
###4710 as speakers condemned the cartoons portraying the Prophet Mohammed.
###4714 l wish l could get your music in America,
###4717 but considering how controversial it's been here in England...
###4727 lnitially, when l did the record,
###4729 a lot of people supported it,
###4731 but then, in the current times that we're in,
###4734 people got really scared.
###4736 lt just shows the stupidity of society,
###4738 which refuses to discuss,
###4742 debate things in an intelligent way.
###4745 And l don't except that.
###4746 l just put my middle finger up.
###4748 One of your big gripes-- and it's a valid one--
###4751 you keep saying that-- in fact, let me read your quote.
###4754 You said, ''Anyone worried about what l'm saying
###4756 should get involved in the debate. You are allowed to dissent.
###4760 - That is a right.'' - Yeah.
###4762 But is that a right in lslam, to dissent?
###4766 Of course it is. Why do you think there's so many schools of thought?
###4768 - Why do you think there's-- - lt wasn't a right for Salman Rushdie.
###4772 The demonstrators set off from Hyde Park,
###4774 bringing much of central London to a standstill.
###4776 Their hatred focused on Salman Rushdie and his book.
###4780 The mullahs pressed home their message in thousands of mosques--
###4783 Salman Rushdie must be killed.
###4785 See, Salman Rushdie was there to provoke,
###4787 insult, and he did it intentionally, right?
###4790 But should you die for that?
###4792 No no, well, l mean, like, that was--
###4794 you know, it's easy for you to say
###4796 things are kind of in black and white.
###4798 They're more complex than that.
###4801 There's emotions and passions
###4803 and philosophy involved
###4805 - and all that stuff. - You know, all you gotta say is
###4807 it's wrong for someone to have to suffer a death threat
###4811 - for writing a book. - Well, hang on.
###4814 But apparently, it's more complicated than that.
###4815 Well, it is because-- but l mean, Western--
###4818 We'll never see eye to eye there,
###4820 but you want that protection for yourself.
###4823 No, l think these debates are a lot--
###4825 l'm willing to discuss 'em in terms of facts and not fictions.
###4829 When you disagree with me, it's a fiction.
###4830 - No no. - You have the truth
###4832 - and l have the fiction. - No, l don't have the truth.
###4834 But you don't see that there's a fundamental hypocrisy
###4835 of you asking for the right to dissent
###4838 and somebody else getting a death threat?
###4840 No no, 'cause my dissent is to stop the madness.
###4848 l'm here with Geert Wilders here in The Hague,
###4850 which of course is home to the World Court,
###4852 but also to the Dutch Parliament.
###4854 You are taking a kind of hard line here
###4857 in the Netherlands.
###4859 lslam is, according to me, a violent religion.
###4862 The Koran is a violent book
###4864 and Mohammed was a violent prophet.
###4866 Do you think lslam wants to take over the world?
###4869 - They don't even make... - Right right.
###4871 ...a secret about it.
###4873 We are infidels.
###4874 l mean, we should either become lslamic or we should be killed.
###4878 This is what they say. This is what they are proud of.
###4880 Okay, we're here at Habibi Ana.
###4882 - Did l say that right? - Yeah.
###4884 You guys, really-- l mean,
###4886 gay Muslim activists,
###4888 that is a very rare job description. You guys have balls.
###4893 How big is the gay community--
###4895 the gay Muslim community here in Amsterdam?
###4898 Or is this it?
###4901 l mean, l'm guessing, Thursday isn't--
###4905 isn't gay night here.
###4907 l hope you guys find each other attractive,
###4910 'cause otherwise--
###4912 you don't feel afraid?
###4913 Here in Holland l'm not,
###4915 but when l came from my country, l was very afraid.
###4917 There was an article of law:
###4919 Punish the gay for one year just because he's gay.
###4921 - Just being gay can get you a year. - Just being gay.
###4924 Same as Alabama.
###4927 What l learned is that they're not really--
###4929 they're not specific against homosexuality.
###4932 They're not specific against, in other words,
###4935 the desire of a man for a man.
###4937 What they are against is specific behavior,
###4941 like anal sex.
###4942 They don't say homosexuality, heterosexuality.
###4947 They just don't want you doing it in the naughty place,
###4949 which l guess,
###4951 if you put that out of the picture in homosexuality,
###4954 what do you have left? Just the blowjob.
###4959 What do you think when people say
###4961 it affects your memory,
###4963 especially your short-term memory?
###4965 - lt does. - And what do you think when people say
###4969 that it affects your memory, your short-term memory?
###4972 lt does.
###4976 - l like my hat. - lt's good. You look good, too.
###4980 l think l do. l think l might adopt this look.
###4982 Yes.
###4983 ls there a reason why you have a black hat
###4985 and l have a white hat?
###4987 We have any color you like.
###4989 So l bought this. l like it myself
###4992 because l like the color.
###4994 There is a lot of tension in the last five years or so.
###4998 ls lslam a threat to Dutch values?
###5002 lslam is preaching,
###5005 above all, peace.
###5007 Peace, peace and peace.
###5031 The name lslam means peace.
###5034 And yet it is involved in a lot of war and violence.
###5036 Yeah, it's just all politics.
###5038 - Nothing to do with religion? - No no.
###5040 - No? - No, sir.
###5041 - lt's political. - lt's politics.
###5043 Seems to be a lot of passages
###5045 that say the infidel
###5048 is not the equal of the believer.
###5051 The infidel will die in hell.
###5053 Don't feel bad about hating the infidel.
###5056 - No. - No?
###5059 Boy, l've got bad information.
###5061 Yes, you have. l think so.
###5063 - No no no no no. - No no no no.
###5065 - No no no no. - No.
###5067 No? No. l'm wrong about everything.
###5070 The way l perceive things in the Koran is not about killing infidels.
###5073 - But you have read it in there? - Of course l've read the Koran.
###5076 You've read those passages, and what did you think when you read them?
###5079 No, but l explain those passages within the time
###5082 in which they emerged in the world.
###5084 That's not how people read holy books.
###5085 People don't read holy books and go,
###5087 ''Well, that was good for then.'' People who read holy books and go,
###5090 ''This is the word of God. lt's forever!''
###5092 - No, l don't agree. - That's how most people do it.
###5095 l just don't buy it that these guys are
###5097 in this state of denial.
###5100 l think they're just in a state of denial
###5102 to an outsider.
###5104 They will not admit anything is wrong
###5107 with their culture to an outsider.
###5110 Muslims were imperialists
###5112 in the century after Mohammed's death.
###5115 They conquered most of the known world
###5118 in one century.
###5119 Yeah, it is possible.
###5122 You call it conquer.
###5124 l think they were trying
###5126 to spread lslam.
###5129 Well, they were, but they weren't doing it by singing ''Kumbaya.''
###5133 Excuse me.
###5136 Sorry.
###5137 Oh, that 21st century's always busting in.
###5143 l'm going to shut it off.
###5145 l love it that he's got ''Kashmir'' as his ringtone.
###5153 Okay, l shut it off.
###5155 - Sorry, l was-- - Yeah...
###5160 Politics, okay.
###5163 Do you think it's possible that when we're on something
###5166 like marijuana or mushrooms
###5168 and believe we're having a very spiritual experience,
###5171 that we're just high?
###5174 - lt's-- it's-- - Oh, look out your head's on fire!
###5177 Boy, talk about the light bulb going off,
###5179 - that was your whole head. - l don't like candles behind me.
###5183 No. Oh, look, l found another joint.
###5186 Uh-oh.
###5190 Can we get closer?
###5192 That is one hell of a wall.
###5211 This is the Dome of the Rock?
###5213 This is the Dome of the Rock. According to lslam...
###5221 On a horse?
###5230 He went to heaven on the horse?
###5232 Why is it holy for the Jews?
###5258 A rock. The Kaaba?
###5260 lsn't that--
###5264 Stone, rock, the same thing.
###5267 Why is that holy?
###5272 Paradise.
###5273 Could the rock itself have been what we know now to be like a meteor?
###5281 But does it make a difference that we now understand
###5283 what a meteor is?
###5286 Yes, right.
###5287 Okay.
###5289 This is the Mount of Olives.
###5291 A lot of Orthodox Jews want to be buried here,
###5294 'cause they believe that when the Messiah comes,
###5297 he will raise them from the dead and march them through
###5299 that golden gate and onto the Temple Mount,
###5302 which is why the Muslims have walled up the gate.
###5306 The better to keep out the Jewish Messiah
###5308 and his kosher zombies from getting in.
###5311 Although you'd think that if you had the power to raise the dead,
###5314 you'd have the power to jump a fence.
###5319 l thought l would not be allowed
###5321 to walk in a mosque.
###5323 l thought only someone of your faith
###5325 was allowed to do that.
###5341 Why is he angry?
###5345 They're angry that you're talking to me?
###5353 Women in your culture
###5356 seem not to be as equal
###5358 to the man as they are in our culture.
###5363 Yes.
###5366 l talked to a Muslim scholar today.
###5368 And he said that Mohammed had a meeting here.
###5381 Mohammed never set his foot
###5384 on that Temple Mount, not even one foot.
###5387 Never ever.
###5390 He was never in the land of lsrael, that's a historical fact.
###5404 l think even l understand that.
###5407 Why can't the people of the different faiths get along?
###5410 All three religions consider the same site
###5414 to be holy.
###5418 ls it not because it was conquered many times?
###5421 - Yes. - lt was conquered first by King David,
###5425 and then later by the armies coming out
###5427 of the Arabian Desert.
###5430 - lt changed hands during the crusades. - We had the Romans.
###5431 We had the Byzantines. We had the Persians.
###5437 There's more than one mosque in the world
###5440 that used to be a church, and before that was a temple.
###5442 Because it's a lot easier just to change the sign on the top
###5446 and say ''under new management''
###5447 than it is to change the whole building.
###5450 l worked a lot of comedy clubs in the '80s
###5452 that still had the disco ball on the ceiling.
###5455 And in the '90s, they became strip clubs
###5457 and now they're a Starbucks.
###5460 l've come today to the village of Cerne Abbas in Southern England
###5464 to show you something completely different.
###5468 lt's in the shape of a giant naked man
###5471 with a sizable erection-- well, sizable for England.
###5474 Some people think that this means
###5475 that there is a giant actually buried under that hill.
###5479 Others think it has something to do with crop circles
###5481 or ancient space visitors or Druids,
###5484 but nobody really knows.
###5486 And that's what l find fascinating about this,
###5488 is that it doesn't really mean anything.
###5491 The locals have been maintaining it for centuries,
###5494 and they don't really know why.
###5496 They just do it because they've always done it,
###5498 and isn't that religion for you?
###5500 Sometimes you kneel, sometimes you fast
###5503 and sometimes you go up on the hill
###5506 and you cut the grass around the giant space penis.
###5509 Do you believe, as so many Christians do nowadays,
###5511 that the world will end?
###5513 l think we are in the end times. There are many many signs.
###5516 The world as we know it will come to an end.
###5518 And beyond that,
###5520 there will be the glorious second coming of Jesus Christ.
###5526 lt seems peaceful,
###5529 but this is the very spot where a lot of Christians believe
###5532 life on earth will end.
###5534 The irony of religion is that because
###5536 of its power to divert man
###5539 to destructive courses,
###5541 the world actually could come to an end.
###5544 A lot of people in this country believe
###5547 in end times.
###5548 There will be this great reckoning, the Rapture.
###5551 - Do you believe that? - l do.
###5561 But if you believe that the world is gonna come to an end,
###5564 and perhaps any day now,
###5566 does it not drain one's motivation
###5568 to improve life on earth while we're here?
###5582 The plain fact is, religion must die
###5584 for mankind to live.
###5587 The hour is getting very late to be able to indulge
###5590 in having key decisions made by religious people,
###5593 by irrationalists, by those who would steer the ship of state
###5596 not by a compass, but by the equivalent
###5599 of reading the entrails of a chicken.
###5602 George Bush prayed a lot about lraq,
###5604 but he didn't learn a lot about it.
###5606 l don't know that much about politics,
###5608 l'll vote for President Bush because of his faith.
###5609 Faith means making a virtue out of not thinking.
###5614 lt's nothing to brag about.
###5615 And those who preach faith and enable and elevate it
###5618 are our intellectual slaveholders,
###5621 keeping mankind in a bondage
###5623 to fantasy and nonsense
###5625 that has spawned and justified
###5627 so much lunacy and destruction.
###5630 Religion is dangerous because it allows human beings
###5633 who don't have all the answers
###5635 to think that they do.
###5637 Most people would think it's wonderful when someone says,
###5639 ''l'm willing, Lord. l'll do whatever You want me to do.''
###5642 Except that since there are no gods actually talking to us,
###5646 that void is filled in by people with their own corruptions,
###5650 - limitations and agendas. - lt's going to happen,
###5654 and l'm not saying necessarily nuclear--
###5656 The Lord didn't say nuclear--
###5657 but l do believe it'll be something like that.
###5659 And anyone who tells you they know--
###5661 they just know what happens when you die,
###5664 l promise you, you don't.
###5666 How can l be so sure? Because l don't know,
###5669 and you do not possess mental powers that l do not.
###5673 The only appropriate attitude for man to have
###5675 about the big questions
###5678 is not the arrogant certitude
###5680 that is the hallmark of religion,
###5682 but doubt. Doubt is humble,
###5685 and that's what man needs to be,
###5687 considering that human history is just a litany
###5691 of getting shit dead wrong.
###5694 Jesus is coming back to rescue the Jews,
###5696 because he is the only one that can.
###5699 The believer goes in the paradise.
###5701 Unbeliever, they will go to hell.
###5705 The Jews are the only reason that l am a Christian.
###5708 - l love them. - But you're not gonna take them
###5710 - to heaven with you, are you? - l'm gonna go in the Rapture,
###5713 and l'm gonna come back on a white horse.
###5726 So you think Jesus will end this earth at some point,
###5729 maybe in your lifetime?
###5731 One always hopes. This is a sign, and that is a sign.
###5733 lf a nuclear bomb went off,
###5735 and it seemed like that was exactly what it had said,
###5738 balls of fire or something,
###5740 you wouldn't look on that as necessarily a bad thing.
###5742 l know l'll be with God.
###5744 This is why rational people,
###5746 anti-religionists,
###5747 must end their timidity and come out of the closet
###5749 and assert themselves.
###5751 And those who consider themselves only moderately religious
###5754 really need to look in the mirror and realize
###5757 that the solace and comfort that religion brings you
###5759 actually comes at a terrible price.
###5762 lt says in the last days there'll be wars, rumors of wars.
###5765 The Bible prophesies from the Book of Revelation--
###5767 they're going to be fulfilled!
###5769 Can this be accomplished without violence?
###5771 - No. - lslam ruling the world,
###5775 global jihad.
###5776 - Who will win out? - We'll win.

###5790 lf you belonged to a political party or a social club
###5793 that was tied to as much bigotry, misogyny,
###5796 homophobia, violence
###5798 and sheer ignorance as religion is,
###5800 you'd resign in protest.
###5802 To do otherwise is to be an enabler,
###5805 a Mafia wife,
###5806 with the true devils of extremism
###5809 that draw their legitimacy
###5811 from the billions of their fellow travelers.
###5813 lf the world does come to an end here or wherever,
###5817 or if it limps into the future, decimated by the effects
###5820 of a religion-inspired nuclear terrorism,

###5825 That we learned how to precipitate mass death
###5828 before we got past the neurological disorder
###5831 of wishing for it.
###5834 That's it. Grow up or die.
###5840 We are in a conflict between good and evil.
###6046 See you in heaven.
###6048 Who knows?
###6051 Yeah, exactly.
