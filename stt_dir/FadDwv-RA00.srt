0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:10,582



2
0:0:10,582 --> 0:0:13,82
-If anyone in the crowd have a
headache, I can heal them in a


3
0:0:13,82 --> 0:0:15,484
couple seconds.


4
0:0:15,484 --> 0:0:16,975
You want to come?


5
0:0:16,975 --> 0:0:17,969
All right.


6
0:0:17,969 --> 0:0:22,27
And you can also use
some Psalms 3.


7
0:0:22,27 --> 0:0:23,31
For our liquid, olive oil.


8
0:0:23,31 --> 0:0:27,19
I put olive oil over this.


9
0:0:27,19 --> 0:0:33,27
And I say, Lord, how are they
increased that trouble me.


10
0:0:33,27 --> 0:0:35,21
Many are they that rise
up against me.


11
0:0:35,21 --> 0:0:37,96
Many there be which say of
my soul, there is no


12
0:0:37,96 --> 0:0:39,64
help for him in God.


13
0:0:39,64 --> 0:0:40,353
Selah.


14
0:0:40,353 --> 0:0:42,51
But thou, O Lord, are
a shield for me.


15
0:0:42,51 --> 0:0:45,31
My glory, and the lifter
up of mine head.


16
0:0:45,31 --> 0:0:47,35
I cried unto the Lord with my
voice, and he heard me out of


17
0:0:47,35 --> 0:0:48,36
his holy hill.


18
0:0:48,36 --> 0:0:49,84
I laid me down and slept.


19
0:0:49,84 --> 0:0:51,36
I awaked, for the Lord
sustained me.


20
0:0:51,36 --> 0:0:53,47
I will not be afraid of ten
thousands of people that have


21
0:0:53,47 --> 0:0:55,75
set themselves against
me round about.


22
0:0:55,75 --> 0:0:56,65
Arise, O Lord.


23
0:0:56,65 --> 0:0:59,16
Save me, O my God, for thou hast
smitten all my enemies


24
0:0:59,16 --> 0:0:59,89
upon the cheekbone.


25
0:0:59,89 --> 0:1:2,9
Thou hath broken the teeth
of the ungodly.


26
0:1:2,9 --> 0:1:4,1
Salvation belongeth
unto the Lord.


27
0:1:4,1 --> 0:1:5,892
Thy blessing is upon
thy people.


28
0:1:5,892 --> 0:1:7,11
Selah.


29
0:1:7,11 --> 0:1:9,86
Let the words of my mouth and
meditation of my heart be


30
0:1:9,86 --> 0:1:15,37
accepted in thy sight, O Lord,
my strength and my redeemer.


31
0:1:15,37 --> 0:1:16,622
Give me your full name.


32
0:1:16,622 --> 0:1:18,78
-Nicholas John Devereux.


33
0:1:18,78 --> 0:1:23,33
-Father of the world, may thou
pleaseth me to be my physician


34
0:1:23,33 --> 0:1:24,39
and helper.


35
0:1:24,39 --> 0:1:25,98
Heal Nicholas--


36
0:1:25,98 --> 0:1:27,26
-John Devereux.


37
0:1:27,26 --> 0:1:28,84
-John Devereux.


38
0:1:28,84 --> 0:1:30,8
From his headache.


39
0:1:30,8 --> 0:1:33,675
Because I can find help with
thee and only with thee is


40
0:1:33,675 --> 0:1:34,76
action to be taken.


41
0:1:34,76 --> 0:1:36,71
In the name of God the
Father, God the Son,


42
0:1:36,71 --> 0:1:39,32
God the Holy Spirit.


43
0:1:39,32 --> 0:1:40,7
And the word
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]


44
0:1:40,7 --> 0:1:43,26
represents Lord of the word.


45
0:1:43,26 --> 0:1:43,83
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]


46
0:1:43,83 --> 0:1:46,93
is a evil word.


47
0:1:46,93 --> 0:1:48,62
The [INAUDIBLE] of the
head is right here.


48
0:1:48,62 --> 0:1:51,91



49
0:1:51,91 --> 0:1:53,16
Just a simple.


50
0:1:53,16 --> 0:2:1,14



51
0:2:1,14 --> 0:2:3,5
KRISHNA ANDAVOLU (OFFSCREEN):
How's your headache?


52
0:2:3,5 --> 0:2:4,3
-Waiting.


53
0:2:4,3 --> 0:2:4,89
-You're still waiting?


54
0:2:4,89 --> 0:2:6,72
-Mm-hm.


55
0:2:6,72 --> 0:2:9,428
Give it a second.


56
0:2:9,428 --> 0:2:12,76
-As you can see from my facial
expression, I'm feeling much


57
0:2:12,76 --> 0:2:14,91
better than before.


58
0:2:14,91 --> 0:2:15,5
It feels--


59
0:2:15,5 --> 0:2:18,255
vast improvement, vast
improvement from prior to


60
0:2:18,255 --> 0:2:19,505
seeing Joseph.


61
0:2:19,505 --> 0:4:19,505
