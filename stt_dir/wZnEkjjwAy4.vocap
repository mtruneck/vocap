###0 FEMALE SPEAKER: Chance to enjoy some of the tunes
###2 that we set out to set the mood.
###4 From Barrett Strong's, "Money"-- that's what I want--
###8 to Pink Floyd's, "Money", to Lady Gaga's, "Money Honey",
###13 it's multiple generations of music all singing the same
###16 tune.
###17 Money is kind of a big deal.
###19 So that's why I'm so excited to introduce you
###22 to Alexa Von Tobel.
###24 And let me read a little bit about her
###25 so that you can get just as excited as I am.
###28 So Alexa is the CEO and founder of LearnVest,
###32 and she's a certified financial planner
###34 who attended Harvard College and Harvard Business School.
###38 Alexa has been featured as a financial expert in the Wall
###40 Street Journal, The New York Times, Fast Company, Forbes,
###44 InStyle, Glamour, the list goes on.
###47 She has been recognized in Inc's "30 Under 30".
###52 She's just been a really, really strong presence
###56 in what's going to be a great and important road.
###60 So without further ado, I really want
###63 to have you meet Alexa Von Tobel.
###66 [APPLAUSE]
###69 ALEXA VON TOBEL: Hi guys.
###71 I'm gonna stand here if that's OK.
###72 Hi guys.
###73 Thank you so much for coming out.
###75 It's Thursday, so I really appreciate
###77 that everyone's coming to hear a little bit about money.
###79 Come in, sit down.
###80 This is going to be totally informal,
###82 and here's the goal of today.
###84 When you leave here in one hour, I
###85 want to make sure that you've learned everything
###87 that you need to about money.
###89 Ask questions.
###90 Stop me.
###91 I'm in middle of actually my book tour,
###93 so "Financially Fearless" is our book.
###95 It's a New York Times bestseller.
###96 It's actually number one on Wall Street Journal on business.
###99 So that's pretty exciting.
###100 It came out about now 12 days ago, 15 days ago.
###103 And so we've been going around the country giving this talk.
###107 I actually gave it to the Google in New York.
###110 I'm going to the Google in Beverly Hills
###111 after this and a bunch of other companies and organizations.
###115 So I've done it a lot.
###116 You're going to have questions.
###117 Ask them.
###118 And I'm going to stay and sit up here at the end
###120 and actually ask one on one questions
###121 if you wanna take the time to do something
###123 that's really specific to you.
###125 So 10 seconds on me.
###126 I grew up in Florida, I went to Harvard.
###128 Went back to Wall St-- to Morgan Stanley and worked as a trader
###133 on the prop-desk.
###134 Went back to Harvard Business School in the fall 2008.
###136 Won a big business plan competition
###138 and ultimately dropped out.
###141 I think we were in the heart of the worst recession in 81
###144 years, and I was literally customer number one.
###147 You guys are really great product people.
###150 I literally didn't know what to do with my own finances.
###152 I was young, I didn't have a ton of money,
###154 I didn't have no money.
###155 I was trying to figure out like, what's a credit score?
###157 What are the things that I need to know?
###159 And what I found was, it was such BS.
###161 Literally trying to navigate your money.
###164 It's like, you literally go Google tons of content.
###166 You don't know it's updated, you don't know if it's wrong.
###169 I actually just had some at the Google in New York come up
###171 to me and actually was in tears.
###172 And she was like, Alexa, I really
###174 need and want to figure out my money.
###176 She was like, I'm not in a bad position.
###178 She was like, but I spent over eight hours trying
###180 to find a financial expert, finally found someone.
###183 Took about a week to get them on the phone.
###185 We got on the phone, and they want
###187 to charge me like a $3,000 retainer,
###188 and then I have to commit that I wanna
###190 work with them for over a year.
###191 She was like, and I don't have thousands of dollars
###194 to spend to figure out my money.
###195 And the bottom line is, I was like, why isn't there a way
###198 to make people feel great about money?
###200 To make it extremely accessible, and frankly, affordable.
###204 And I'm going to share some really important stuff.
###206 But the goal of today is for you to walk out feeling smarter.
###209 I'm really psyched that we got you guys books.
###212 And without further ado, we'll get started.
###216 So first, what is LearnVest?
###217 We've raised $45 million.
###219 We're now one of the leading and fastest growing
###221 online financial planning companies in the whole country.
###223 We raise money from Excel Venture Partners.
###225 We actually just closed a big round of another $20 million.
###228 We're located in New York City.
###230 We've got 110 employees.
###231 By the end of year we'll probably have about 180 to 200.
###236 Plainly, simply put, we are a program for your money.
###239 We literally, and you guys get product, as I said, so well.
###242 We spent the last three years, got
###243 some of the best certified financial planners.
###245 That's the doctor for your money.
###247 Most people don't even notice CFP is.
###249 We then took a bunch of really great product people
###251 and technologists, and we built really rich software
###254 that can take any household, whether you make $50,000,
###257 or $500,000, And quickly find out
###260 what your big weak points are.
###262 Like where you have sort of red alerts,
###264 and then figuring out how you can make progress
###266 on your money.
###267 It's a really simple program.
###269 The goal when I set out was that I want to make it accessible.
###272 It shouldn't be this like, five day process,
###274 where you don't know where to go.
###276 You don't know if it's actual expert.
###278 It's really expensive.
###279 Because the message that happens there is you then
###282 tell yourself, I shouldn't be doing this.
###284 It's so complicated.
###285 It's so hard.
###286 Clearly I shouldn't be taking care of my money.
###288 When in fact, that's not the point.
###290 And then finally, we wanted to make it trusted and unbiased.
###293 So our experts at LearnVest don't sell anything.
###296 They just give you advice.
###297 And my whole family's in medicine.
###298 And one of the things that I started
###300 recognizing as I was building the company,
###302 was you literally could go to some experts
###305 and they actually get paid to sell your product.
###307 The problem there, it's like going to the doctor
###308 and them getting paid to pump you
###310 full of antibiotics and shots, when you're actually just sick
###314 and need someone to take care of you.
###316 Next slide.
###318 So first, follow me and LearnVest.
###321 We're on the tour for the next 30 days.
###323 But also, shoot questions to us.
###325 We will answer them.
###326 But we share a ton of behind the scenes,
###328 a ton of really important money hacks at all times.
###331 So, this is us.
###332 Next.
###334 And really quickly, so the book's
###335 call-- I wanted to call the book, "The F Word",
###337 first of all.
###338 Because none of us wanna talk about money.
###339 It's this topic.
###340 It's super stressful.
###342 In fact, like for a century, like
###343 we've taught everyone never to talk about money.
###345 It's this totally impolite thing.
###347 But the problem is, everyone deals with money.
###350 In fact, we make 6 to 10 money decisions every single day.
###354 And we will every day that we're alive on this earth.
###357 I actually go so far as to say that financial planning should
###360 be, literally should be a civil right.
###362 Just like sort of getting access to health
###364 care, because if your money's in complete disarray,
###367 you can't protect your family, you
###368 can't take care of yourself, you can't
###370 lead even a normal average life.
###373 And so, I'm actually going on this tour.
###375 It's kind of crazy.
###377 I was in Denver this morning, I was in Nashville yesterday,
###379 Chicago the day before, Indiana the day before that,
###381 and going back to New York.
###383 Shooting everything from, tomorrow morning
###385 we're on Good Morning America.
###387 We're supposed to be shooting Piers Morgan tonight,
###389 all the way to next week Seattle, San Francisco,
###392 Jacksonville, etc.
###394 Running around the country, doing this.
###396 Going to high schools colleges, churches, hospitals, companies.
###400 Literally giving this money talk so
###401 that everyone gets empowered.
###403 We call it "Financially Fearless America"
###405 because a really important rule is, I've probably
###408 talked to well over 10,000 people,
###410 and I've actually never met a single person that has said,
###413 I feel great about my money.
###414 It is just this topic of stress, anxiety, eating cu-- none of us
###419 grew up with enough money, trust me.
###420 Even if you did, you know someone who grew up with more.
###423 It's really this topic of pretty deep stress and strain.
###427 You're not saving enough, you don't make enough.
###429 Because it literally is this topic
###431 that you always are comparing.
###433 And the problem with that is, we know mathematically, about 85%
###437 of the audience is too embarrassed
###439 and too stressed out to actually go and jump and make progress.
###442 And about 15% sort of feels maybe ish confident.
###446 They're like, I think I'm doing it, I think I'm doing it.
###448 And what we find is both a really bad,
###450 because you end up not actually making progress on your money.
###453 Next.
###454 So some really important stats.
###456 Right now, 76% of the country, and I gave a TED talk on this,
###460 feels out of control when it comes to their money.
###463 And we describe exactly what we found.
###466 It is like being in a boat in the middle of the ocean
###468 and you literally just don't know which way is land.
###471 That may sound dramatic, but it's actually pretty accurate.
###474 And the reason, what we find, is the average person
###476 can spare a lit-- and by the way,
###477 this is obviously not above the average audience,
###480 and you'll see some stats about the more money you make,
###482 how things actually can get more complicated.
###485 But the takeaway here is, you're in the middle of the ocean.
###488 And let's just say you can spare a few thousand dollars a month.
###491 Which, let's just say that that's
###492 what this room can spare.
###494 You then have so many priorities,
###496 that you're not quite sure which bucket to fill first.
###498 Do you pay down student debt?
###500 Do you pay down credit card debt?
###501 Do you contribute to your 401K?
###503 There's a matching program here.
###504 Do you think about 529 plans for your kids?
###507 Do you help your aging parent, which,
###508 that is a really big new topic that our generation will
###511 be faced with.
###512 Do you have emergency savings?
###514 Do you contribute to your mortgage?
###516 I mean, you quickly can see, that you end up being like,
###518 where does my next dollar go?
###520 Like, how do I prioritize?
###522 And the takeaway is, most people feel pretty stressed out.
###525 Next.
###527 So right now, 61% of the country,
###529 so just think about the whole country,
###531 literally lives paycheck to paycheck.
###533 Which means that they are not in the position,
###536 if anything happened, to be able to go grab some cash
###538 and do something.
###539 Most people have less than one month
###541 of savings of what their life costs them.
###544 And what's really interesting, especially for this room,
###546 is 30% of people who make over $100,000,
###549 live paycheck to paycheck.
###551 So I say that because we sort of intuitively
###553 think having more money means that you have less money
###556 problems.
###557 But we all know exactly what happens.
###558 You get the slightly bigger home,
###560 with the nice marble counter tops.
###561 And you drive the nicer car.
###563 And you go on the slightly nicer vacations.
###565 So simply having more doesn't mean
###566 that you have any less problems.
###568 And I make that point, because when
###569 you think about your own money, and when
###571 you think about sort of the we all
###572 do the comparison situation.
###575 Simply because someone makes more money does not
###577 mean that behind the scenes, they're in a better situation.
###580 And I can tell you, we've seen the bus driver
###582 who makes $60,000, who owns two homes, and has no debt.
###586 And we've seen the Wall Street guy or gal
###588 who makes $250,000 who has $20,000 of credit card debt,
###592 doesn't own anything.
###593 And the takeaway there is, what you make,
###596 and what you do with it are very, very different things.
###600 Next.
###601 So, I always go through these excuses
###604 and I say it just because I have literally-- LearnVest
###607 is massive.
###608 We have hundreds and hundreds of thousands of users.
###611 Adding anywhere from about 1000 to 5000 a day.
###613 People write in all the time, and I read probably at least 50
###617 to 100 emails every day.
###619 And I can't tell you the number of people
###622 who-- we hear the excuses.
###623 And it's things like, but I don't have enough money
###625 to care about my money.
###626 And actually, mathematically, when you have less money,
###629 it is actually more critical for you
###632 to know where your next dollar should go.
###634 Which, my whole TED talk was about how financial planning
###636 should not be a luxury product.
###638 Right now, if you have well over a million dollars,
###640 there's a slew of places you can go to get investment advice.
###644 But if you have less, which 98.6% of the country
###646 has less than a million dollars, there's
###649 not a lot of great places to go.
###650 In fact, I would argue that there was not a great place
###653 to go, before LearnVest.
###655 So first, I don't have enough money.
###658 I'm ashamed.
###659 I don't want to get started.
###661 Last night, I was in Denver, and a woman who was in her
###664 '60s came up to me and was like, I cannot tell you what I would
###667 have given for someone to tell me this when I was
###669 in my '20s, '30s.
###670 Maybe even '40s, because it could have changed so much.
###673 She was just like here I am, and I can't do a lot.
###676 So we always say like, the problem's not going to go away,
###678 you just have to solve it.
###679 And it's about making that barrier
###681 to solving it pretty low.
###683 We get a lot of, I don't even know what a financial plan is.
###686 Well, that's what I'm going to walk through.
###687 That's what the book walks through.
###688 And I'm gonna share some of my favorite hacks for you
###690 guys today that are absolutely worth your time.
###693 And then finally, we see a lot-- again,
###696 a small portion of people say I kind of
###697 think I handle on things.
###699 And then we actually look at their finances
###701 and see that they're no better off,
###703 but they just sort of think that they are.
###705 And so the takeaway is, put those excuses aside.
###708 You already did.
###708 You came to this talk.
###709 But I like to say them out loud, because they sort of run
###711 through all of our heads.
###712 Next.
###713 So, this is LearnVest.
###715 We literally as I just said, raised $45 million
###718 with the whole goal of disrupting
###720 the financial planning space.
###722 Let me talk about what that means for a second.
###725 Right now, like that whole offline, go see a planner,
###728 print out your documents, bring them to them.
###730 It is so anticrated.
###731 When you think about the incredible things
###733 that a company like Google has done, or Apple's Genius Bar,
###736 or even Weight Watchers, a program for your weight loss.
###741 For me, the financial space is so old school.
###744 Literally, banks are open from like 9:00 to 5:00.
###746 Actually the bank near me closes on Saturdays its open
###749 from 11:00 to 2:00.
###750 I'm like wait, what?
###751 It's Saturday.
###753 But it is this last space that hasn't been completely
###756 disrupted by incredible technologies.
###758 And so all we did was pretty simple.
###760 We built an incredible basic way to filter any household
###764 to make sure that they know what to do.
###765 And then we connect you to an expert on our staff.
###768 And then we got rid of all the BS.
###770 All the friction.
###770 I don't know where to find someone.
###772 It's way too expensive.
###773 I don't know how to get them my information.
###775 So the tips that came out, that are in this book,
###778 are from four years of being a certified financial planner
###781 myself.
###782 From talking to literally thousands of customers.
###785 From tremendous amounts of research.
###787 And I'm going to tell you guys the one,
###788 because at the end of the day, I'm
###789 not that different than you guys, in the sense
###790 that none of us have extra time.
###792 We're all-- you know, you have your job, you have your family,
###794 you have your kids, you have your health,
###795 you're juggling so much.
###796 So one of the big things at LearnVest,
###798 we only share things that are worth your energy.
###801 Things are going to make a real impact on your financial life.
###804 Next.
###805 So we developed this thing, it's called the Action Program.
###807 It's literally a seven step process.
###809 And it can take any one.
###810 Any household.
###811 One thing you guys should know is
###813 our users are between 25 and 65.
###815 Our core users are really in their '30s and '40s,
###818 and they're often households.
###819 You know, if you're single, it's single.
###821 But if you're married, it's both.
###823 And we put you through this filter.
###824 What I'm going to do today is walk you
###826 all through the filter.
###827 So think about your own situation.
###828 Think about the tips that really resonate.
###830 Write down questions.
###831 And again, I'll answer some broad ones at the end.
###833 And then I can sit up here and answer one on one questions.
###836 So, the first step is organize.
###838 I cannot tell you guys the number of people,
###841 really well educated by the way.
###842 So I don't care if you went to Harvard Business School
###844 and work at Goldman Sachs, you went to community college,
###847 we don't learn about this in school.
###849 I had two great educations.
###851 Doesn't matter.
###852 We don't learn about it in high schools or colleges
###853 across the country.
###854 I was actually just at the White House
###857 last Thursday with Congresswomen trying
###859 to figure out how we can actually
###861 start changing some of the rules around that.
###864 But the takeaway is, regardless of your education,
###866 regardless of what you make, we see disorganization everywhere.
###870 And here's what I mean by that.
###871 First of all, ideally, all your accounts are online.
###874 I mean, even my husband who went to Harvard with me,
###877 he still had that like one account
###879 that doesn't have anything online.
###881 And I was like, what are you doing?
###883 We've gotta like, be able to see that.
###884 You've got to be able to log in.
###885 You can't wait for paper statements.
###887 Or to have a bank it's literally in a different state
###889 that you actually can't go and see.
###891 So one of the things that we recommend
###892 are, and again, we don't work with any banks directly.
###895 We don't promote any accounts.
###898 Everything that you do you should be able to be online.
###900 And I'll give you a quick sense.
###901 So, people come in all the time and we end up
###903 realizing that they have like 14 accounts.
###905 When you have a household, and you have kids,
###907 it quickly can turn into 20 accounts.
###909 And so we just say, fewer is better.
###911 Plain and simple.
###912 You know, you're FDI insured up to a huge amount of money.
###915 And so first, link them to the LearnVest Money Center.
###918 It's our free tool.
###920 Great, great five star ratings etc.
###922 If you go to the next slide.
###924 Let me give you some really specific things.
###926 So first, my accounts, I actually have personally,
###930 two credit cards.
###931 Now with my husband I have a third.
###932 I have my Bank of America account,
###934 because I have ATMs within three blocks of me
###937 in both places, my job, and my home.
###940 I have all my money over at Fidelity, and my 401K is there.
###944 That's it.
###945 That's what we got.
###945 That's what we're working with.
###946 And it's really--
###948 AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].
###948 ALEXA VON TOBEL: FDIC?
###950 AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] split their money
###952 between different accounts so that none of them
###954 was above the limit.
###955 ALEXA VON TOBEL: If you have, if you're with a partner,
###958 you have up to $2 million of FDIC insurance.
###961 And it's across four types of accounts.
###964 So, I'm not in a position where I have more than $2 million
###968 of cash, so you're ultimately protected.
###970 And then if it's in a brokerage account, it SPIC insurance,
###975 and that's even more.
###976 So the takeaway there is, if you are in a household that
###979 has less than that, it makes sense
###981 to be able to put your money there.
###983 For us, why I just showed you how
###985 we have our accounts set up, is because everything then
###988 goes into one email address.
###989 It's basically Alexasbills@gmail.
###991 I get all of our statements in one place.
###994 If you looked in my like Gmail right now,
###995 I have 23,000 unread emails, because you
###998 know, all of the alerts that you get.
###999 I get my news alerts from everything.
###1001 And what would find is, bills, statements, alerts,
###1003 things I should probably be seeing would get lost.
###1006 So what we say is, with your household, link everything
###1009 up to a new, fresh, clean account.
###1012 Next with that, then I run my finances
###1014 like I run my social life.
###1015 I have my Google Calendar set up.
###1017 And I have some really specific alerts.
###1019 They're outlined in detail in the book.
###1020 But the following: in January, I contribute
###1023 to my IRA, and my 401K.
###1026 You guys have matching, so that's free money.
###1028 You should take advantage of every dollar that.
###1030 If you can go above the $17,500 that you can put into a 401K
###1034 at work, then you want to contribute to an IRA.
###1037 We recommend that contribute to an IRA at the beginning
###1040 of January because you get a full extra year of tax
###1043 free earnings.
###1044 And the takeaway there is, either sit down
###1046 and put in the $5,500 that you can,
###1049 or set it so that it's going to automatically do it
###1052 across the year.
###1053 That's an alert on my calendar in January.
###1056 In January, I also go to all my doctor visits.
###1058 I do them all in one month.
###1060 And I'll share with you in more detail a few reasons why.
###1062 But your health is your biggest asset.
###1064 And actually, you have great health insurance,
###1066 take advantage of it.
###1068 In January I also sit down with my husband.
###1070 And if you have a family, what are we trying to do?
###1073 What are our goals for the year?
###1074 What are we trying to save for?
###1075 And really sit down and map it out.
###1077 Where do we want to be in one year?
###1079 Three years?
###1080 Then break it down into months.
###1081 You can really get a sense of what you should be saving.
###1084 These are the beginning pillars of what
###1085 a financial plan looks like.
###1088 I also, every three months, check my credit score.
###1090 And every year I check my annual credit report.
###1092 Just again, they're on annual renews.
###1095 They just alert.
###1096 I get them on my phone.
###1096 It's pretty straightforward.
###1098 I can't forget.
###1099 But those are the things that we do.
###1100 You then have alerts for when your credit cards are due.
###1103 And I'll go into a lot more detail what
###1105 goes into your credit score, but the takeaway is, missing a bill
###1108 is literally one of the simplest things that
###1110 can hurt your credit score so badly,
###1112 and it's just not worth it.
###1113 And particularly the bills that really mess up
###1115 are doctors visits.
###1117 Because they're mom and pop shops.
###1119 They tend not to have great online systems.
###1121 Right?
###1121 You go to your dermatologist, they send you a paper bill.
###1124 We as young people in this generation,
###1126 we move all the time.
###1127 So if you don't do mail forwarding, you miss a bill,
###1129 it's $86.
###1131 They turn you over the credit agencies.
###1132 Those are the sort of things that
###1134 happen that really affect people's credit scores that
###1136 are simple.
###1137 So what we say is, make sure you have a uniform system
###1140 to track everything all in one place.
###1142 Next, as I said, set up an email address
###1144 where everything comes in.
###1146 The average person doesn't check their bills.
###1148 Why we say-- there's Mint and then there's
###1150 LearnVest, and both of us, you can see everything
###1153 in one place.
###1153 We have no ads in it.
###1154 It's literally just your data.
###1156 And one of the things that I do pretty much every day,
###1160 at least every few days, is login, take a money minute,
###1163 and just check what's going on.
###1164 The reason I do that is, pretty much every three months I
###1168 find an issue.
###1168 And I'll explain what that means.
###1170 Let's say I ate at a restaurant for $100.
###1173 I tip 20%, it was $120.
###1175 I will find, if I log in, sometimes people
###1178 change your tips.
###1179 It happened.
###1180 I'd be like it was-- you're nodding, it happens.
###1182 It's crazy.
###1183 But I was like, wait, I didn't tip $40.
###1186 And one of the things is if you don't actually
###1188 have everything that's online, accessible.
###1190 Linked through a place like LearnVest,
###1192 where you can see everything in one place, where
###1193 you can log in-- you know, if I go,
###1194 I can't tell you what I eat for dinner seven nights ago.
###1197 So if I go look at a bill, I don't
###1199 know if it's exactly right, but I take the time to do it
###1201 and then I use credit cards where I can dispute things.
###1204 So one, I think it's really important
###1206 that everything's online.
###1207 I think it's really important all linked to one place.
###1209 And I think it's really important,
###1210 one of the things we learned is, well over more than half
###1213 the country doesn't even open their bills.
###1215 And game here plan number one is open your bills.
###1219 Have them come into an email address.
###1220 And then finally, I log in once a day
###1222 so I can actually see what's going on.
###1224 Next.
###1226 Step two is focus.
###1227 So this is a really important step.
###1230 And again, we built this entire system
###1232 to put a household through it, and it's
###1234 very thoughtfully in a certain order.
###1236 So first, we've gotta get you organized,
###1237 we gotta know what your numbers are,
###1238 we gotta see exactly what's happening.
###1240 From there, we have to figure out
###1242 what comes in every year or every month, and what goes out.
###1245 And let me explain.
###1246 So I can't tell you the number of people
###1248 that are like, I make $100,000.
###1250 And I'll be like, you don't.
###1251 You make $68,000.
###1253 Because you have to think of your life in after tax dollars.
###1256 And the reason why we say that is, one,
###1258 it's really easy to over inflate what your household income is.
###1261 Like, you make $100,000, I make $200,000, we make $300,000.
###1265 But you have to think about an after tax dollars.
###1268 So first, look at your paychecks.
###1270 Quickly figure out, multiply it by 26 or 27,
###1272 based on the number paychecks you get.
###1274 That's the first thing.
###1275 What really comes in?
###1277 And for freelancers, for people who
###1279 have extra money on the side, it gets more complicated.
###1281 Then, what goes out.
###1283 So, plain and simple, you have your obvious fixed expenses.
###1286 Your rent, those sort of things, that are clear, you know them,
###1290 they're very regular.
###1291 But on the other stuff, the restaurant and bars,
###1293 the travel, the shopping; that's the stuff that people never
###1296 really have a good grasp on.
###1297 And so one of the things is one, do
###1300 you know that there's actually money at the end of the month?
###1303 So, if you're not tracking it, and again, 61% of the country
###1306 is living paycheck to paycheck.
###1307 Which basically means they're spending more than they make.
###1310 And so, again, good people with good incomes, that happens.
###1314 So what we look at is what comes in, what's going out,
###1316 and we help you get a real sense.
###1318 And you know, LearnVest has great trends and analysis.
###1320 And at the end, we find out what is left.
###1323 We then go through this is really good negotiation process
###1325 with you where, let's just say, your household makes $7,000
###1329 a month and at the end, there's only $1,000 left.
###1332 We figure out, is there anything else we can do?
###1334 And we have great tips in the book.
###1336 And our planners literally work and tweak,
###1339 and we find a way, how do we get $1,000 to be $2,000?
###1341 Because we can get you towards your goal so much faster.
###1344 So we help you figure out how to cut costs,
###1345 things you can turn off, really great hacks.
###1347 And basically, we come up with what's
###1348 the number at the end of the month?
###1350 Let's just say it's $2,000.
###1352 Next.
###1353 So one thing is, you go to your budget.
###1355 This is a really important financial planning principal.
###1359 So I'm a CFP, just so you guys all know what that means.
###1362 It basically means you have to go to school for about a year.
###1365 Pass many tests.
###1366 You then have to take a two day, 10 hour exam.
###1369 And honestly, it's the hardest exam I've ever been through.
###1372 It's only about a 30% pass rate.
###1373 It's not only extremely broad in the topics
###1376 it covers, but extremely deep.
###1379 And this is one of the best principles
###1381 that I learned in it.
###1382 So, I didn't make it up, but it's
###1384 one of the things that sort of changed my life, in terms
###1386 of thinking about my money.
###1387 So let's just say, for the sake of this example,
###1390 that my household makes $10,000, after taxes.
###1393 That's what comes in.
###1394 So when you think about living within your means,
###1396 what that really means, is 50% or less,
###1399 should go to essentials.
###1400 Essential is what this actually essential to live.
###1403 It's the roof over your head, it's your groceries,
###1405 it's your utility bill, and it's your transportation
###1408 to and from work.
###1409 So for you guys, you drive.
###1410 So it's not just whatever your car payment is.
###1413 Your auto insurance, and your gas.
###1415 So that's what's essential.
###1417 Ideally that's 50% or less.
###1419 One of the reasons is, if you're a two person household,
###1422 if someone lost their job, you would still
###1424 be able to maintain your essentials
###1425 without going into debt.
###1427 A really important about that 50% is, of the 100, 30% or less
###1433 is your rent or mortgage.
###1435 So this is the one that people get wildly wrong.
###1437 And I can't tell you the number of people that will come in,
###1440 and their rent or their mortgage is 60% of what they make.
###1443 And we can see in a 10 second window,
###1446 that you're going to have a pretty jeopardized
###1448 financial future, because of that one decision.
###1450 And I say that for the following reason.
###1453 20% is supposed to go towards the future.
###1456 And I'll walk you through why.
###1457 But 20% of what you take home every month
###1459 should go to if you have debt, paying down your debt.
###1461 If you don't have debt, contributing
###1463 to your retirement.
###1464 If you are already maxing out your retirement,
###1466 your next savings goal, whatever it may be.
###1468 Whether it's saving for your kids 529 Plan,
###1470 helping with some dream, some small project
###1472 you want to work on, whatever it may be.
###1475 And then, 30% is the fun stuff.
###1477 That's the lifestyle budget.
###1478 That's the like do you want to go shopping?
###1480 Do want to go travel?
###1481 Do you want to have an Equinox membership, etc.
###1484 And one of the reasons why people often will be like,
###1486 well my rent's 60%.
###1488 And we're like, well your 20%'s gone.
###1490 And the truth is, you can't really
###1491 live on your 30% being anything--
###1495 we say-- people are like, but I can make that 10%.
###1498 Well here's the problem.
###1499 Every time your phone rings, literally every time,
###1501 someone's calling you to ask you to spend money.
###1504 They're calling, do you want to go for margaritas?
###1505 Do you wanna go to the gym?
###1506 Do you wanna go to the game?
###1507 Do you wanna meet for yoga?
###1508 Do you wanna get a manicure?
###1509 Your parents need something, doesn't matter.
###1511 Every time someone's calling you ,
###1513 they're asking you to do something that requires money.
###1515 And people just don't have the willpower to always say no.
###1518 That's also not a fun life to live.
###1521 And so what we find is, if you are in a position
###1523 where your rent is more than 30% of what you take home,
###1526 you often end up in a big mistake.
###1529 You're not saving enough for the future.
###1531 You're in a position where you wildly have to underspend,
###1534 which is pretty difficult for a lot of people.
###1536 And so the takeaway there is, my mentor,
###1538 she's one of the early founders of Goldman Sachs.
###1540 And she's on the board of Goldman Sachs, said to me
###1542 early when we were building LearnVest together, she goes,
###1545 Alexa, the number one thing you can
###1547 do to always keep your finances in shape,
###1549 is always spend beneath your needs
###1550 in your living environment.
###1551 And so if it's rent, that's pretty clear.
###1554 But for your mortgage, is what we call PITY, principal
###1557 and interest, taxes and insurance,
###1559 because those are the four things that you
###1561 must have in order to be able to afford that home.
###1564 So right now, if you're way over 30%,
###1567 we don't recommend you go sell your house.
###1569 It's just, you need to be aware that you're actually at risk.
###1572 So next.
###1574 Really quickly, on credit scores,
###1576 this is one of the ones guys, that I can't tell you,
###1578 I had like almost a full hour of questions last night
###1581 about this.
###1581 And it's pretty regular.
###1583 Here's the takeaway, your credit score really matters.
###1585 As extremely smart, talented people in this room,
###1588 it is the only grade that matters
###1589 after you leave the education system.
###1591 And here's why it matters.
###1592 So over my life, in the next 60 years,
###1594 I'm gonna buy probably four or five homes.
###1596 I'm probably also going to like, get a nice car,
###1599 start another business, whatever it may be.
###1601 Every time I go to borrow, they're
###1603 going to look at one number.
###1604 They're going to be like, what's your credit score?
###1606 They'll look at your income too, but that's basically the grade.
###1609 From there, it's the difference of 4% interest or 3% interest,
###1613 based on what it looks like.
###1615 Over 40 or 50 years, that could be more than $100,000,
###1619 $200,000, of saved earnings in interest,
###1622 because my credit score is good.
###1623 It's that simple.
###1624 And again, this is literally why I was in Washington.
###1626 I was making it so that credit scores, and giving college kids
###1629 credit cards, should be outlawed.
###1631 The average college senior gets their credit score
###1633 on like, Freshman welcome day, with a free piece of pizza.
###1636 And they graduate with $4,000 in credit card debt.
###1639 And they're already in a position
###1640 where they also have $20,000 in student debt
###1642 and they make less than that in their first few years out
###1644 of school.
###1645 So as a result, it's really hard for them
###1647 to change that situation.
###1648 So, credit score really matters.
###1651 It ranges from 300 to 850.
###1653 Everyone in this room, you want it to be about 700.
###1656 Ideally, it's above 760.
###1657 That's considered excellent.
###1659 That makes a big difference.
###1660 And here are the three things.
###1661 Only look at the top three, because the ones at the bottom
###1663 aren't even worth your time.
###1665 Number one, payment history.
###1666 Never miss a bill.
###1667 Missing a bill knocks it about 60 points, even up to 100.
###1670 And it takes literally a year, two years, three years to fix.
###1674 Something as simple as an $86 dermatology bill.
###1677 Number two, is your credit utilization rate.
###1679 So what's important about this, and it
###1681 sounds like a complicated concept, it's not.
###1684 Let's just pretend I had one credit card,
###1685 and it was $10,000, that was my limit.
###1688 So I have one credit card, let's just say $10,000 limit.
###1691 If you're carrying no debt, you don't have to care about this.
###1694 If you're carrying zero credit card debt at all times,
###1696 you always pay your bills in full,
###1698 you're at 0% for that credit utilization.
###1700 You're in good shape.
###1701 If you are carrying debt, and let's say
###1703 that I'm carrying $5,000 of debt on that one credit
###1706 card, that $10,000 limit, I'm utilizing my limit at 50%.
###1711 If it's above 50%, red flags go off.
###1714 So you first, want to get your credit below 30% utilization.
###1717 Which means, across all your credit cards,
###1719 you have to know what your total limit is.
###1722 But Additionally, the takeaway, the big thing
###1724 here is, just pay down your debt as quickly as you can.
###1726 That's the best way to improve this, and it is a huge portion.
###1730 And then finally, your length of history.
###1732 So, the take away here is, you want
###1734 to go to annual credit report once a year, as I told you
###1736 in the beginning.
###1737 You want to print out that credit report.
###1739 And you wanna look at all the things
###1740 that are associated with your social security number.
###1743 I promise you, you will find mistakes.
###1745 Most people do.
###1746 And the takeaway is, you want to know,
###1748 not only what's associated with you,
###1749 so that you can dispute anything that's not yours.
###1752 But also, you may find, you know,
###1753 that silly Bloomingdale's credit card that you
###1755 opened to save 15%, blah, blah, blah.
###1758 And the takeaway there is, what you want to do
###1759 is, never close your oldest credit card.
###1762 And the reason being is, that's your longest line of history.
###1765 So that's what goes into your credit score.
###1767 It really matters.
###1768 And the takeaway is, don't miss bills,
###1770 pay your debt down to zero, and don't close your oldest credit
###1772 card.
###1772 One important thing is if you're sitting here
###1774 and you have seven credit cards, don't go out and close all
###1777 them.
###1778 You really can only close one credit per year
###1780 because it affects that utilization.
###1782 What it does is, it starts quickly
###1784 lowering your ability for limit very quickly.
###1787 And it can make or your credit score dip.
###1789 So don't do anything major with your credit.
###1791 Also, if you're going out and borrowing in the next year,
###1793 or going back to grad school, or anything like that, because
###1796 it will dip a little bit.
###1797 So.
###1798 I love the site called CreditKarma.com.
###1799 I know the founders.
###1800 They're good people.
###1801 They have the same mission that LearnVest does.
###1803 To empower people.
###1803 And you can check your credit score there for free.
###1806 Next.
###1808 After all of that's done, you're organized,
###1810 you know your numbers, you know where you stand,
###1812 you know your net worth, then we go into Planning.
###1814 So go back to, remember I said my household,
###1816 let's just say at the end of it, I
###1818 have $2,000 of free money every month.
###1820 So we then make that money, it has
###1822 to go essentially to three things.
###1823 This is three priorities before anything else.
###1826 First, paying down your debt.
###1829 Second, is dealing with your retirement
###1831 and making sure that you're on track.
###1833 And we run this really simple rule for you.
###1835 We can take anyone in this room, find out how old you are,
###1838 find out what lifestyle you would like in retirement,
###1841 and look at your account and we can tell you if you're on track
###1843 or not.
###1843 And then finally, an emergency savings account.
###1846 So when you think about financial planning,
###1848 these are three essential pillars
###1849 that are critical to starting.
###1851 And I can't tell you the number of really smart people
###1853 that start being like, I wanna invest and I wanna buy a home.
###1856 And we're like, you can't do that until you
###1858 make sure you've covered these three things.
###1860 So let's run through them really fast.
###1862 And guys I'm gonna go a little faster because there's
###1863 a ton of good content in here I wanna get through.
###1866 So really quickly, good debt, bad debt.
###1868 All debt is not created equal.
###1869 Bad debt is credit card debt, and it's car loans.
###1872 The second you drive a car off the lot, depreciating asset.
###1875 So, any debt that has a depreciating asset,
###1877 is considered bad debt, and it hurts your credit score,
###1880 and you want to get rid of it.
###1881 Good debt is things like student debt and your mortgage.
###1885 The asset in a house, hopefully it goes up in value
###1887 and it's not considered as negatively
###1889 against your credit score.
###1890 And then student debt, and guys, you know, the entire nation
###1893 is under a trillion dollars of student debt.
###1896 So I can't tell you the number of people who have come in.
###1898 My brothers are doctors.
###1899 One's a surgeon.
###1901 Hundreds of thousands of dollars of student debt.
###1903 The good thing there is, the government has set up a system,
###1906 because our brain is the asset, and they're investing in us,
###1909 so that we can actually earn greater for the future.
###1911 The one takeaway there is, I can't tell you
###1913 the number of people that come and say,
###1914 I'm going to go to x school.
###1915 I'm gonna pay $100,000 to get a master's degree, and I'm like,
###1919 is it going to increase your salary enough to pay it down?
###1921 So don't just collect degrees for the sake of it.
###1924 If it can't increase your salary, it's pretty tough.
###1926 Next.
###1928 So, retirement.
###1929 This is a really simple graph.
###1931 I brilliantly came up with it, it's so complicated.
###1933 It's so simple.
###1934 You're 25 years old.
###1936 I wanna retire at 65.
###1938 I live to 95.
###1940 So I work for 40 years to fund 70 years.
###1944 Plain and simple.
###1945 I only really work for half the time
###1947 that I will be funding myself.
###1949 So if you are not putting away at least 20%
###1951 towards the future, you're not going to be on track.
###1954 It's that simple.
###1954 And I was literally with the head
###1956 of the treasury for all Colorado yesterday.
###1958 And we were talking about the fact that, literally
###1961 quick history tip here.
###1962 In the '70s, pretty much all of our parents, a lot of them,
###1965 had pensions and Social Security.
###1967 They literally, we, as a country would fund your retirement.
###1970 The problem is, great science is happening.
###1972 We're living much longer.
###1973 And companies started flailing because growing populations,
###1976 they weren't able to keep up.
###1978 So what happened is, we went from a very paternalistic
###1980 government, where we were trying to fund people in retirement,
###1982 and we shifted it to you and us all funding our own retirement,
###1986 via the 401K.
###1987 The big problem was, there was no education about that.
###1990 So they gave us the responsibility,
###1991 but didn't make us really understand the big impact.
###1994 And the result is, most people are off track for retirement.
###1997 And it's really tough, because a lot of our parents
###2000 are not going to be on track.
###2001 And so it means that we will be funding our parents.
###2004 And I'm telling you guys, I see this from even affluent people.
###2006 Where there just like, my mom's living til she's 98 years old.
###2009 And it's $100,00 to have care.
###2012 It's very expensive.
###2013 And as a result, our money could be filtering out.
###2016 Which means, we're worse off, and our children are worse off.
###2018 And it's this huge domino effect.
###2021 So the takeaway here is, walk away from here,
###2023 increase your 401K.
###2024 If your 401K maxed out, which is awesome,
###2027 go contribute to an IRA.
###2028 Next.
###2029 Quick graph.
###2030 When I was Harvard undergrad, I was like such a math dork,
###2033 that I like went to a money presentation that I found.
###2036 And here's the really simple things.
###2038 Compounding interest.
###2039 It's not magic it's math.
###2040 And Jessica starts when she's 20.
###2042 She puts away the same dollar amount as Kate.
###2044 Literally at retirement, simply putting the same dollars
###2047 but with a 20 year difference, what happens
###2050 is, Jessica has over a quarter of a million dollars more.
###2053 So if you think about the biggest hacks
###2055 that you can possibly come up with,
###2057 right now, before you have a lot of responsibilities,
###2059 put away as much money as possible into retirement.
###2062 That's the takeaway.
###2063 And one thing you guys should know,
###2065 is we see a lot of people in their late '30s
###2067 early '40s with a few kids, with mortgages,
###2069 thinking about their kids college.
###2070 And they never contributed to their retirement.
###2072 And it's really hard once you're in that position, where you're
###2075 running a full household, to find extra money.
###2077 So the takeaway is, you want to contribute ideally
###2079 before you have kids.
###2081 And again, wish this was a class, before you have kids.
###2083 Because once you do have a family, it gets much harder.
###2086 And this is a great earning audience,
###2089 so you will always be able to be maybe
###2091 better off the average American.
###2092 But it's still pretty hard.
###2094 And so, I'm lazy.
###2095 Start early.
###2096 It does the work for you.
###2097 Which is great.
###2098 Step four, is Build.
###2099 So then, after we get through that.
###2101 We've made sure those three things are on track
###2102 and have a game plan.
###2103 In step four, this is when you should
###2105 start to think about the other things.
###2107 Am I having children?
###2109 Do I like my home?
###2110 Do we want to upgrade our home?
###2111 Are we thinking about starting a small business?
###2113 Are we thinking about a vacation to Tahiti?
###2115 I love the customers that walk in the door and their like,
###2118 I truly wanna go on a trip.
###2120 And we're like, let's first make sure that we
###2122 can cover you and protect you.
###2124 So, then we start to build towards the future.
###2126 We have these really great tracking devices.
###2127 It's all through the money center,
###2129 that you can set up goals.
###2130 We show you how many months you're going to be there,
###2132 and we do it all automatically for you.
###2134 Step five is Protect.
###2136 And I'm going to take an extra few minutes on this one guys,
###2138 because this is one of the most important things
###2141 that you will learn that I will say here today.
###2143 So, my same mentor who was a professor at Columbia
###2148 basically was like, Alexa, what if I
###2150 could promise that you will never go bankrupt.
###2152 I'm like, that'd be pretty cool.
###2153 Put me in coach.
###2154 What do I have to do?
###2155 And the takeaway was, be properly insured.
###2159 LearnVest doesn't sell insurance.
###2160 In fact, I don't like people, typically, who sell insurance.
###2162 Because they get big chunks of commission.
###2164 And they typically tell you probably more than you need.
###2167 But what is important about this is, insurance is actually,
###2170 in the financial planning exam, it's
###2172 step one of a financial plan.
###2174 We made it step five, because people
###2176 tend to be pretty daunted by it.
###2178 And it's not a sexy topic.
###2180 It is not fun.
###2180 I actually joke that I drank a whole bottle of wine
###2182 while I was writing the chapter on Protect Yourself.
###2185 But it is so critical, you guys.
###2188 And let me give you a few important examples.
###2190 So first, 62% of the country that went bankrupt this year,
###2195 went bankrupt not because they didn't have insurance,
###2199 because they were improperly insured.
###2201 Meaning, they didn't know what they're riders said.
###2203 They didn't know Hurricane Sandy-- my husband's family had
###2206 a house in this place called Breezy Point.
###2209 Literally most people lost almost everything they had.
###2211 And it was because they didn't know
###2212 that they didn't have flood insurance.
###2214 And when it flooded, sorry.
###2216 That's not covered.
###2217 And it's literally critical for you to know,
###2219 what's not covered, what is covered.
###2221 Am I in a place where, I was in Denver yesterday
###2223 with tornadoes.
###2224 Do you have tornado coverage?
###2226 You need it.
###2227 If you're in California, earthquake coverage.
###2229 And the takeaway here is, I'm going
###2231 to walk through all the types but, insurance.
###2234 One, it's not that expensive, often.
###2237 But it is critical that you layer it
###2238 into your financial plan.
###2240 And one thing for me, you know, I built LearnVest,
###2242 not because I want people to be rich,
###2244 but I want people to be able to enrich their life.
###2246 And for me, what's invaluable, is financial security.
###2248 So that anything in the world can happen,
###2251 and I don't have to worry about the money.
###2252 You can lose your job tomorrow, and you have a game plan
###2254 to figure that out.
###2255 Someone in your family can get sick, and you're OK.
###2257 And you guys are going to be able to focus
###2259 on the person who's sick, not all the money
###2261 implications of it.
###2263 And when I promise you, like life will happen.
###2265 I share in the first chapter of the book,
###2267 one of the reasons I'm really passionate
###2268 about personal finance is, when I was 14,
###2270 my dad unexpectedly passed away.
###2272 My mom had three kids.
###2273 And she didn't even know where our money was.
###2276 So there, she was dealing with a major life event,
###2278 scrambling to figure out what to do with our finances.
###2280 And I think what's really important is, in those moments,
###2283 that's why you have a financial plan.
###2284 So you can look at whoever's really suffering
###2287 and say, we're fine, we're going to figure it out.
###2289 So the takeaway on insurance, if you go through quickly.
###2292 Next slide.
###2294 So you can't read it, but I can.
###2296 You need homeowners, and you need renters.
###2298 I have an employee who actually literally just started, got
###2301 renters insurance, because she's working at LearnVest,
###2303 and everyone who works at LearnVest
###2305 has a full financial plan.
###2306 Her apartment was on top of a pizza place
###2308 and the oven caught on fire, and burned her entire apartment
###2310 down.
###2310 She lost 90% of what she owns.
###2312 And she came to me.
###2313 She had like two weeks out of the office
###2315 to deal with the crisis.
###2316 She came to me was like, because of you, I get all new stuff.
###2319 All new.
###2320 And renters insurance is $20 month.
###2322 And I mean, these stories happen,
###2323 and they happen all the time.
###2325 And I get to hear about them, because all the emails come in.
###2327 But it's critical.
###2328 So homeowners insurance, and you need renters insurance.
###2331 Disability, I'm pretty positive that Google offers it.
###2334 Opt in today.
###2335 You are 10 times more likely to be disabled then
###2337 you are to die.
###2338 And the takeaway there is, if something bad happens,
###2341 you want to make sure that you're
###2342 getting not just Any occupation, but Own occupation.
###2346 That's the key.
###2347 That replaces whatever salary you currently have.
###2349 If you have Any, so let's say you work here,
###2351 and let's say you make $100,000.
###2353 And you have Any disability insurance called Any.
###2356 What it means is, if you can go work at McDonald's, you
###2358 don't get $1.
###2360 Because you get a $30,000 job at McDonald's.
###2362 So it's really important that you know the difference.
###2365 Term, you need it.
###2366 You need, if you're married, if you have kids,
###2368 you need life insurance.
###2370 And again, our experts from LearnVest
###2371 will tell you the exact dollar amount.
###2373 They will tell you exactly what you really can afford,
###2376 and what you should be protecting.
###2378 If you have a lot of assets, if you're
###2379 someone who has a really nice home, who
###2381 has money coming from their family.
###2383 You want maybe umbrella insurance.
###2384 You want to further protect your assets.
###2387 Long term care, this is a pretty fascinating one.
###2390 And because we are all living longer, in your '30s and '40s,
###2393 you can buy long term care pretty inexpensively.
###2395 And it all depends on what your medical history
###2397 is, and things like that.
###2398 But like, my grandmother, who I saw
###2400 last Sunday is 95 years old, and she's like, kicking.
###2403 She is like, icy as hell.
###2405 And I'm like, oh my god, she's going live
###2407 for like, 10 more years maybe.
###2408 And the home she lives in is like really expensive.
###2410 It's like $90,000 a year.
###2412 And luckily, she was able to afford that.
###2415 But I wouldn't be able to pay for that if that happened.
###2417 And so one of the things that's important
###2419 is, this is an insurance that may make sense in your '30s
###2422 and '40s to potentially get.
###2423 And then we also walk through these documents.
###2425 And I'll give you estate planning documents,
###2427 as boring as they are.
###2428 You can go to LegalZoom, you actually
###2430 get a discount through LearnVest at LegalZoom.
###2432 Fill them out.
###2432 Takes a few minutes.
###2433 And I'll give you an example.
###2434 If you have a child, and you don't have a Guardian letter,
###2437 those are the sort of things that we call red flags.
###2439 And we would help you do first.
###2441 Because money doesn't matter.
###2443 But if, God forbid, something happens to you
###2444 and you don't know who's actually
###2445 become the legal guardian of your child,
###2447 for me that's step one.
###2448 And so that's the sort of stuff that our program
###2450 takes into account.
###2451 And what we do is we put you through the filter,
###2452 and we figure out all the things that
###2454 are critical that you must do.
###2455 And then we start talking about the things you want to do.
###2458 Next.
###2459 And then finally, step six is Maximize.
###2461 And so, really smart people, and I mean really smart people,
###2464 come in the door of LearnVest every day, and they're like,
###2467 I want to invest.
###2468 And we're like, yeah, we'd love you to invest.
###2471 But let's first make sure that you
###2473 have those pillars in place, and that you're
###2474 protected from everything.
###2476 And if at the end of that, you still have extra money,
###2478 then here's what we ask you.
###2480 So we'll look at your 401Ks, we'll
###2482 make sure that you have the appropriate asset allocation,
###2484 we'll make sure that they're invested
###2485 in things that are inexpensive.
###2486 I'm going to assume that you have a great 401K here.
###2489 But outside of that.
###2491 Let's say I have an extra pocket of money
###2492 after getting through all of those steps,
###2494 but my husband and I are going to buy a house
###2495 in New York in the next two or three years.
###2497 Money shouldn't be invested.
###2499 It should have zero equity exposure.
###2501 And so we put you through a few things.
###2502 One is the rule of five.
###2503 Do you need the money in the next five years?
###2505 If it's money to go on a trip, to go start a small business.
###2509 Just literally, you want to have it
###2511 there because you're having a baby in a year.
###2513 We're like, no, no, you can't invest it.
###2515 So literally, rule of five.
###2516 If you need it in five years, it should
###2518 have zero equity exposure.
###2520 The other thing is quick--
###2521 AUDIENCE: What's equity exposure?
###2522 ALEXA VON TOBEL: So literally it's any set of stocks.
###2524 It's ETFs that have like an S&P 500,
###2527 it's anything where the underlying
###2528 asset is portions of companies.
###2531 What we would recommend, potentially
###2533 again, depending on who you are and what your goals are,
###2535 is things like CD ladders or bonds.
###2539 And long story short, another important tip that maybe you'll
###2542 appreciate is, for your 401K or your IRA,
###2547 which are both just investment accounts for retirement,
###2549 most people can't maximize.
###2550 It's $23,000 a year you can put away.
###2553 You should be doing that, before you
###2554 should be doing anything else.
###2556 And what we look at is, it's called the rule of 120.
###2558 You take 120 and you minus your age.
###2560 So let's say I'm 30.
###2561 120 minus 30.
###2562 90% should have equity exposure, because that's
###2565 where all the risk is.
###2566 And over the last century, the average stock market return,
###2570 the average over a century is 10%.
###2572 So that's great.
###2573 And in fact, you need to be investing
###2574 to outlive that inflation, which is 3% a year.
###2578 The takeaway here, a lot of people
###2579 just quickly jump to conclusions mat, and they're like,
###2582 I should be investing.
###2583 And the takeaway is, it's really about these principles
###2585 to make sure that you're doing it in the right thematic order.
###2589 And then step seven is literally,
###2592 anytime your life changes, we gotta
###2594 rerun every scenario for you.
###2596 And one thing I will tell you guys
###2598 is, if you're doing anything major,
###2601 if you're buying a home, if you're having a child,
###2603 if you're changing majorly jobs, moving across coasts.
###2607 If you're in a position where someone in your family is sick.
###2610 You're going to major life event,
###2612 take the time to talk to an expert.
###2614 It is critical.
###2615 You don't know all the things you don't know.
###2617 And it's not all Google-able.
###2619 You can't go and find them.
###2621 And the real big key here is, before LearnVest existed,
###2624 it was thousands of dollars to be able to talk to an expert.
###2627 But one thing that we really say is,
###2628 these big things that you're going through, I just
###2631 talked about insurance, the riders
###2633 are like multiple, multiple pages of fine print.
###2636 You're no lawyer.
###2637 Like you're not an insurance expert.
###2639 It's worthwhile to make sure that God forbid, Hurricane
###2642 Sandy or an earthquake happens, you're protected.
###2645 And you guys can absolutely all afford
###2647 to be able to talk to an expert.
###2649 And it's worthwhile.
###2650 And I'll just say, as part of just the LearnVest program,
###2653 we actually worked with a bunch of behavioral experts from MIT,
###2655 and some really serious behavior scientists.
###2658 And figured out that a lot of people learn this stuff,
###2660 and then it's overwhelming, so they don't actually do it.
###2664 So one of the things that we're doing, it's January.
###2666 90% of the country's financial resolutions is do it.
###2670 And when I wrote the book, if you go to the next slide.
###2673 So when I wrote the book, one of the things that we did was,
###2676 we wanted to make not only financial planning affordable,
###2678 but we wanted people to actually do it.
###2680 So just 10 seconds on how our company works,
###2683 because you guys obviously are so attached to the web.
###2686 So it's literally like a gym membership.
###2688 You pay an up front fee, you get connected to an expert,
###2691 and then it's $19 a month, and you can shut it off
###2693 at any time.
###2694 If you go to the next slide.
###2696 Here's what the process is.
###2697 You fill out an online profile, and this asks you everything.
###2700 Where are you today?
###2700 Where do you want to go?
###2701 What would you like to have happen?
###2703 What does financial security mean for you?
###2705 What are the risks that keep you up at night?
###2707 And we actually go and build everything.
###2709 Next.
###2710 You get your own dedicated financial planner
###2712 through LearnVest.
###2714 These are people on our staff.
###2715 They're CFPs, which I just told, in order
###2718 to even be a CFP you by nature have
###2719 to have about four years of experience.
###2721 Most of ours have 10.
###2723 But you get the same dedicated expert,
###2725 and they're on demand for you.
###2726 If you go to the next slide.
###2728 So this is literally what a financial plan looks like.
###2731 We built our own software because the stuff
###2733 that was out there was pretty bad.
###2735 What it does is literally, and you
###2737 can't see it necessarily perfectly is, we literally
###2739 build you a budget.
###2740 Show you where every single dollar should go.
###2743 We even then build a calendar.
###2744 And it shows you, so go back to let's say
###2746 you have $2,000 at the end of the month
###2748 that you can use toward your goals.
###2750 We break it down month by month, where it should go
###2752 and what it should look like.
###2754 And I think the takeaway here is,
###2756 this is what a financial plan looks like.
###2757 It is dollar per dollar.
###2759 And what I love about financial planning
###2760 is, guys I come from a family of doctors.
###2763 You know, when it comes to cancer like,
###2765 it's really stressful because we don't have the answer.
###2767 Like, we're working in labs trying to figure it out.
###2770 Financial planning, and why I believe
###2772 with all my heart and soul, literally
###2773 should be accessible to everyone in the country is,
###2775 it's just math.
###2776 It is not-- at the end of the day, what's
###2777 complicated is the rules and all the legislation.
###2779 But if you know what someone's dollar amount is,
###2781 you can put it through a system and you can tell them
###2782 exactly what they need to do.
###2784 And so anyways, we build you a calendar.
###2786 And then the final thing is, we literally give you unlimited,
###2789 if you go to the next slide, we give you
###2791 unlimited phone and email support.
###2792 Your expert's on demand for you.
###2794 Put them on your speed dial.
###2796 And you always get the same person.
###2797 And so, this is in a nutshell what
###2799 I've spent the last four years of my life building.
###2801 If you go to the next slide.
###2804 Google got you guys books, which is awesome.
###2806 In the book, everyone gets a $50 credit
###2808 if you want to work with your own expert.
###2810 And if anyone wants to get a plan,
###2812 we just as a thank you for having us here,
###2815 we'll give you an extra month of service.
###2816 But I'm going to stand up here, and I'm
###2818 going to answer any questions.
###2819 And the one thing I will say that's so important
###2821 is, everyone can make progress.
###2827 I would gamble to say that everyone in this room
###2829 is in a pretty good situation, where you actually
###2831 have extra money at the end of the month
###2832 that you can put towards goals.
###2834 So then it's a matter of making sure that actually happens.
###2837 But anyways.
###2838 Most people are pretty stressed.
###2839 Lots of people have questions, so I'm
###2841 going to stay as late as I possibly can,
###2842 before I go to the other Google.
###2844 What's your question?
###2845 AUDIENCE: OK.
###2845 My question is something you said about credit reports.
###2848 ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yep.
###2849 AUDIENCE: Credit rating.
###2849 ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yep.
###2850 AUDIENCE: And, I want to make sure I
###2852 understood what you said, so--
###2853 ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yep.
###2853 AUDIENCE: You said, credit utilization
###2855 is based on a balance held over a period.
###2858 So it wouldn't be the amount a person used and then paid off.
###2862 That doesn't count towards credit utilization?
###2864 ALEXA VON TOBEL: You're absolutely correct.
###2865 So let's just say, I actually have an American Express credit
###2867 card.
###2868 Also you guys should call and actually increase your credit
###2870 limits if you are able, if you have good credit.
###2873 So I have an American Express card with a $50,000 limit.
###2876 If I go buy a car on it, which by the way
###2878 would give me great points.
###2879 My whole life is 1% on sale, which is awesome.
###2882 And I pay it off in full every month, no issue.
###2884 But American Express doesn't let you carry a balance anyways.
###2887 But if you have three credit cards, total limit of $10,000,
###2890 and you're carrying $10,000 of debt month over month,
###2893 that's when you are in big trouble.
###2894 And the key there is, just pay your credit card off in full.
###2897 And for those--
###2898 AUDIENCE: Every credit report I actually got,
###2901 ever, told me that my revolving balance
###2904 is negative [INAUDIBLE] let's say $10,000 credit limit.
###2909 ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yep.
###2909 AUDIENCE: My revolving balance is like, $3,000,
###2912 but it's paid off every month, the credit report still
###2915 said that's negative on my credit report.
###2919 ALEXA VON TOBEL: Because you're spending-- but
###2921 are you carrying any of the debt?
###2922 AUDIENCE: No.
###2923 ALEXA VON TOBEL: Month over month?
###2924 AUDIENCE: Nothing's carried forward.
###2925 ALEXA VON TOBEL: I think you may have a misunderstanding there.
###2926 Because if you pay it off in full every month,
###2928 you're good to go.
###2930 So, that's the key.
###2931 And again, you can send us your credit report,
###2933 and we'll actually walk you through it if you want us to.
###2935 Step by step.
###2936 AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] like, you're
###2937 using too much of your credit.
###2939 [INAUDIBLE]
###2940 AUDIENCE: Ask for more.
###2942 ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yeah.
###2942 What I would do is, if you have a good credit score,
###2944 first I'd call.
###2945 One of the reasons why we tell you to increase your credit
###2947 limit, is it boosts your credit score a little bit.
###2949 But also, if God forbid, like shit totally hits the fan,
###2953 you are in a position where you can go out
###2955 and access, God forbid something really catastrophic happens.
###2959 We would never want you to use credit, but is there.
###2961 And so it's one of the things, and for example,
###2964 also when you get really sophisticated with your money,
###2966 I have a $50,000 credit limit.
###2968 I could by a car, and get points for it.
###2970 Which actually means it's like 1% to 2% off.
###2972 That's the sort of stuff that like really
###2974 is sort of maximizing your finances.
###2976 Go ahead.
###2977 And-- Yeah.
###2978 FEMALE SPEAKER: If everybody can come to the microphone.
###2979 It's just better for the recording.
###2980 ALEXA VON TOBEL: Oh, perfect.
###2981 Sorry.
###2981 Everyone come to the microphone.
###2982 And guys, I love these questions.
###2984 I get them nonstop.
###2985 And there's really, like there's no such thing
###2987 as a dumb question.
###2988 AUDIENCE: My question, you mentioned Mint.com,
###2990 which I've been using, and it's been helpful.
###2992 But there are some bugs with it.
###2994 ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yeah.
###2994 AUDIENCE: Like certain accounts don't work at all.
###2995 And the biggest one for me is our Google stock account
###2998 doesn't work with it.
###2999 So I'm just wondering if you know if your software does,
###3001 and what the differences between your software and Mint are?
###3004 ALEXA VON TOBEL: So great question.
###3004 And I love you for asking that.
###3006 So first, our biggest--
###3008 AUDIENCE: Other reasons as well.
###3009 ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yeah.
###3010 The first biggest difference, and I
###3012 think Mint is a great tool that you can see everything
###3014 in one place.
###3014 We don't recommend anything.
###3015 In fact, what I don't like what Mint does,
###3017 is they do make all these recommendations of products.
###3019 You opening extra credit cards, not
###3020 good for your finances at it's core.
###3022 Good for Mint, they'll get $150.
###3024 But the other thing is, so we run no ads through it.
###3027 But the real key is, if you're working
###3028 with one of our experts, they can,
###3030 once you upgrade, and work with a planner, boom.
###3033 They can see your entire account right there.
###3035 They can set goals for you.
###3036 They can set budgets for you.
###3038 You don't have to communicate anything.
###3039 You don't have to take the time and energy to say,
###3041 here's all my paperwork.
###3042 Here's what's going on.
###3043 So the biggest real difference is, the tool is free for us,
###3046 and it's just part of the app.
###3049 It's working with a planner that actually
###3051 makes you change your finances.
###3052 So, that's the biggest difference.
###3055 And for the Google stock, I do not know the exact answer.
###3058 We'll get back to you as soon as I possibly can.
###3060 Go ahead.
###3061 I wish I had Google stock, that'd be awesome.
###3064 AUDIENCE: So beyond insurance and financial investments,
###3068 retirement savings, is there anything
###3071 you think most people don't spend or consume enough?
###3077 ALEXA VON TOBEL: I mean I really can tell you this.
###3079 I don't care what your household looks
###3081 like, if you walk in the door for us,
###3083 we find big blind spots.
###3085 Things that you were like, whew, you
###3087 don't have like the right level of auto insurance.
###3090 That's not good.
###3090 You drive like, seven times a day.
###3093 So one of the things that we find out, and again,
###3095 like step one.
###3096 Get organized.
###3096 Have less.
###3097 Follow it.
###3098 Track it.
###3098 I mean, you guys saw all the crazy Target stuff.
###3100 Neiman Marcus got broken into today, their credit cards.
###3104 Track it.
###3105 Because it behooves you-- sorry.
###3107 It behooves you in every single way.
###3109 So we get you organized.
###3110 Then we make sure that you actually
###3111 know what you can spare.
###3113 And a lot of people don't spare as much
###3115 as-- if you're making $10,000 a month, your household,
###3118 we're like, save $3,000.
###3120 Come on.
###3121 Like, let's do it.
###3122 And then we can start working towards your goals.
###3124 And I think, to answer your question,
###3127 those goals include things like, you
###3128 need to be able to pay premiums on insurance.
###3130 Because that's actually step one of protecting your household.
###3134 So most people do not have the right insurance.
###3136 They don have the right legal documents in place.
###3138 And it sounds really complicated,
###3139 but what's great about our experts,
###3141 they just tell you to do.
###3142 They're like, shh.
###3143 Here's what you need.
###3144 We don't sell anything.
###3145 So we're totally aligned with you.
###3147 And then, go talk to these three providers and go.
###3149 Now you're armed in a position to get it.
###3151 So that's the biggest thing, is I
###3153 think most people aren't saving enough,
###3155 and then they just don't know what their blind spots are,
###3157 necessarily.
###3158 And they're often not paying what they need to on insurance.
###3162 Go ahead.
###3163 AUDIENCE: So you mentioned not closing
###3164 you're oldest credit card.
###3166 ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yep.
###3167 AUDIENCE: Is that per provider?
###3168 I'm in the position where I just actually changed
###3170 Bank of America cards to a to a rewards version.
###3172 If I close the old one and start using the old one instead,
###3175 is that going to create a discontinuity?
###3177 ALEXA VON TOBEL: Potentially.
###3177 So one of the things that you should know
###3179 is, I had like a card when I was 16, 17, that my mom had opened.
###3184 And I had like a junior card on hers.
###3186 First that wasn't building my credit,
###3188 but that was my oldest line of history.
###3190 I then have another line of credit--
###3192 I had my own credit card that I opened when I was like 21.
###3195 So oldest credit card.
###3197 I then said hey, I'd like to change that card
###3199 to better card that would suit my needs today.
###3201 And they were like, if you close it,
###3203 that ends that line of credit.
###3205 And so the takeaway there is, sometimes
###3207 it does make sense to keep a credit card that's
###3209 not like your favorite, because it
###3211 is you're oldest line of credit, and to get another card.
###3213 And so like I'll give you a sense of some of the cards
###3216 that we like.
###3216 So one in general, free American Express cards are great.
###3220 You get points, and they actually
###3221 make you pay them off in full every month.
###3223 So I like that.
###3224 You're not able to carry debt there.
###3227 Chase has a great freedom rewards card
###3229 for people who like, spend a lot on groceries and gas.
###3231 So when you're outside of New York City,
###3234 and you're driving a ton.
###3235 Great.
###3236 5% back.
###3237 So I would say go open another card
###3239 and use it and just keep it open.
###3241 Because there's not any risk.
###3242 If you have just a few credit cards and you monitor them.
###3244 What I don't like are like, they Ann Taylor cards, the Gap
###3247 cards.
###3247 All that BS, which actually, it's a funny story.
###3250 Over the holidays, I was buying a $17 shirt at the Gap,
###3253 like a work out t-shirt.
###3254 And they were like, would you like to open a line of credit?
###3257 You'll save $4 today.
###3258 And I almost punched the poor woman.
###3259 I was like, you're talking to the wrong girl right now.
###3262 [LAUGHTER]
###3262 ALEXA VON TOBEL: But the takeaway
###3263 there is, those are the cards that don't even have on-- you
###3266 can't log into some of them.
###3268 The national average on a credit card is 17% negative APR.
###3272 On those cards, it's often like 30%.
###3274 So that compounds daily, by the way.
###3276 The best savings account in the country is 1% right now.
###3279 So, they're horrible.
###3279 So the takeaway, I would say, leave your oldest one open,
###3282 and then go get another credit card that you really like.
###3284 AUDIENCE: All right.
###3284 Thank You.
###3284 ALEXA VON TOBEL: You're welcome.
###3285 AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] create a statement
###3287 if your balance is not zero.
###3288 So there's no statement that shows that you paid.
###3290 [INAUDIBLE].
###3291 ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yeah.
###3292 I mean.
###3293 It's nuts.
###3293 Go ahead.
###3294 AUDIENCE: So I have two questions.
###3295 The first is, what about opening checking and savings accounts?
###3298 Do those affect your credit score?
###3299 ALEXA VON TOBEL: Not at all.
###3300 A checking account, a debit card is not credit.
###3302 So that's one thing that's really important guys.
###3304 Debit, credit, like black and white.
###3307 And then opening things like savings accounts,
###3309 that's totally fine.
###3310 One of things that I don't like is
###3311 when you have a mutual fund at this old brick and mortar
###3314 store that you like aren't tracking,
###3316 and don't even know if like-- one of the reasons why we like
###3319 people to really consolidate is, we
###3320 need to look at-- so I'm just going to make this up.
###3322 Let's say I have a million dollars,
###3324 across like my cash and my investments.
###3326 We have to look at your portfolio as a whole.
###3328 Is everything properly allocated based on what your goals are?
###3331 And when you have a little bit of money
###3332 there, a little bit of money there,
###3334 a little bit of money here, you can't track it all.
###3336 It's much harder to look at it as the full picture.
###3338 AUDIENCE: OK.
###3339 And so you recommended calling our credit card companies
###3343 and asking them to increase your line of credit.
###3345 So last time I did that on my credit card,
###3347 they asked me for a reason.
###3349 What is the reason that you recommended getting that.
###3351 ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yeah.
###3351 So, there's scripts like this in the book,
###3352 if you have credit card debt, exactly how you can potentially
###3355 negotiate it down.
###3356 You may not always win.
###3357 But you can say, I've just been a really healthy customer.
###3361 As you can see, I pay my debt in full,
###3363 and I ultimately want to be able to use this card more.
###3367 That's what they want to hear.
###3368 That's how they make money.
###3369 So you're like, I just want to be able to use this card more.
###3371 It's my favorite credit card.
###3372 Boom, you're done.
###3373 AUDIENCE: Thank you.
###3374 ALEXA VON TOBEL: They're like, please,
###3376 thank you for spending on my credit card.
###3379 AUDIENCE: Are your financial planners
###3381 able to work with you if you have accounts internationally,
###3383 in addition to US?
###3384 ALEXA VON TOBEL: So, it's pretty fun for us
###3386 how many people are like can you help us.
###3388 So, one of the things, it depends
###3390 exactly what the situation is.
###3392 And I can spend a lot more time to like ask you in detail,
###3394 but the takeaway is, if you have accounts in other countries,
###3397 we can help you think that through.
###3399 But if you were like a Canadian citizen,
###3400 and everything is there, and you happen to just be living here,
###3404 we're not going to be the best.
###3405 Because you're going to be dealing
###3407 with like 401Ks in Canada that are actually very different.
###3409 They're called like RBSs, or something.
###3411 But the takeaway is, if you have a few accounts
###3413 abroad, we can help you think it through.
###3415 But if you are living full time in the United States,
###3417 and like going to stay here for a long time.
###3420 And I want to go abroad as quickly as we possibly can,
###3423 I'm just dealing with customers coming in every minute right
###3426 now in the US.
###3427 Go ahead.
###3427 AUDIENCE: All right.
###3428 I was wondering can you make mortgage payments
###3430 on like credit cards and get points back?
###3432 ALEXA VON TOBEL: That's a really great question.
###3434 So a few things.
###3435 It depends.
###3437 The most likely answer is absolutely not.
###3439 But one thing that is really helpful
###3441 is, if you want to be in a position
###3443 where you are just like hacking your life,
###3445 you can make your mortgage payments twice a month,
###3447 instead of once a month.
###3448 Where you make an extra payment throughout the entire year.
###3451 So instead of 12 payments you can make 13 payments.
###3453 Is what it adds up to.
###3455 And so that's one of the best things we help you do.
###3457 Because also that interest compounds daily.
###3459 So what it not only does is force you just to budget better
###3462 and actually make an extra payment, but over time,
###3464 we like, and it's in the book.
###3465 We like, run a scenario for you of like how much you
###3467 can save on interest simply just by doing that.
###3470 So that would be a smarter tip.
###3471 AUDIENCE: Thank you.
###3472 ALEXA VON TOBEL: You're welcome.
###3475 AUDIENCE: So, one thing that I think
###3477 that when I've looked at what CFPs can provide
###3482 for me, or for people in general,
###3484 it's like a lot of when you've got money
###3486 that you need to put in different pots, that's
###3488 one thing.
###3489 But like, if you have like a question about should I
###3493 become a landlord?
###3495 That's a harder question to answer,
###3496 and I'm wondering how do you deal with something like that?
###3499 ALEXA VON TOBEL: So actually, I mean that's like a pretty not--
###3502 that's a pretty standard question that we get.
###3504 For a few reasons.
###3505 Actually, what's amazing about the financial system
###3509 in the United States is, once you get really organized
###3511 and start getting pretty healthy,
###3512 there's so much awesome stuff you can do.
###3514 So then we're like, second properties,
###3516 where you can become a landlord, and all the tax benefits.
###3519 And there's like tax shelters that are really complex,
###3521 but if you are in a position where you can potentially
###3523 become a landlord, we could show you
###3525 exactly what the benefits would be.
###3526 So that's a pretty standard question, actually.
###3528 We have a lot of customers who are landlords, or who
###3530 have rental properties, that have been beneficial tax
###3533 benefits.
###3534 And then, if you have kids, there's
###3536 so much cool stuff that you can do.
###3538 I'll give you a 10 second example.
###3540 Your parents can actually tax free, pay for their educations.
###3543 Move money to your children's accounts.
###3545 You can overfund your first 529 plan
###3547 so that your second kids are going
###3548 to be better taken care of.
###3549 I mean, there's so much stuff once you're in a position
###3551 where you have extra money.
###3552 So in fact, I should have said, you know,
###3554 our average customer's household individual incomes are actually
###3557 above $75,000 to $100,000, and household incomes
###3559 are in the $200,000 to $300,000 range.
###3561 Those customers come in, and we can do so much for them.
###3566 But we also sign up 23-year-olds who
###3567 are like, I'm just getting started.
###3569 And we're like, yes, get started.
###3571 Because then you'll be in position
###3572 to be able to have more money for the future.
###3574 So when you have healthier finances,
###3575 there's so much more you can do.
###3577 And yes, we answer that question a lot.
###3578 AUDIENCE: Thanks.
###3579 ALEXA VON TOBEL: You're welcome.
###3581 AUDIENCE: Two questions.
###3582 One is the, one of the frustrating things about,
###3585 about online-- about the packages that
###3589 pull your online accounts is that there's always
###3593 this account where you can't really pull the information.
###3596 So do you have some kind of system?
###3597 I just put it into a spreadsheet and upload it, or?
###3599 ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yeah.
###3600 Even better.
###3600 We just let you add a manual account
###3602 so you can add any-- first of all,
###3604 you can link to LearnVest literally everything.
###3606 Debt, student debt, mortgages, credit cards, small businesses.
###3611 You could actually link your entire small business
###3613 into LearnVest and have your own small business
###3614 if you're a small business owner.
###3616 You can add assets like jewelry, cars,
###3619 literally like solid assets.
###3622 You can add things like annuities.
###3623 You can pull those through.
###3624 And then, if anything doesn't link,
###3626 so some people have credit unions.
###3628 And they're like these tiny little very like--
###3630 and one of the things is, we'll look at your credit union
###3632 and be like, is it worth you keeping it?
###3634 Are the benefits so strong?
###3636 And if you can't link it, you can add a manual account.
###3638 And your planner just helps you do that.
###3640 But also, the planner helps you evaluate whether or not
###3642 you should keep those accounts.
###3643 AUDIENCE: And the second question
###3644 has to do with privacy.
###3645 I mean, if I join, I'm going to like, everything is open to you
###3650 guys.
###3650 How do you deal with that?
###3651 ALEXA VON TOBEL: So, 10 seconds on that answer.
###3653 So number one, it's actually just a mirror in.
###3655 I think you guys as like technologists
###3657 will appreciate this.
###3658 You can't move a dollar.
###3659 It is a mirror into what's happening with your finances.
###3662 So first, there's no account numbers,
###3664 it's just a window into what's happening with the money.
###3668 So you can't accidentally have it hacked and move money,
###3672 you're not at risk.
###3673 There's no account numbers or anything like that.
###3675 Second, were a registered investment adviser.
###3677 We report to the SEC.
###3678 So, we go through compliance both technical,
###3682 literally running all of our technical compliance,
###3684 but also internal compliance, every literal month.
###3688 But the takeaway here is, deeply safe and secure.
###3691 Also just one of our very recent investments
###3695 was places like American Express Ventures invested,
###3697 because American Express eventually
###3699 is going start offering LearnVest with their credit
###3701 cards.
###3701 As a bene-- not a benefit that they pay for,
###3703 but as a way to help improve their customer's well being.
###3707 So we have to go through all their technical scrutiny
###3710 as well.
###3710 So, yes, yes, yes.
###3711 AUDIENCE: Thank you.
###3712 
###3715 AUDIENCE: Two questions.
###3717 I recently reread "The Millionaires Next Door".
###3720 ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yep
###3721 AUDIENCE: And one of the things that they mentioned--
###3723 ALEXA VON TOBEL: I loved those.
###3724 AUDIENCE: Is that people who are wealthier or good accumulators
###3728 of wealth actually spend about eight hours
###3730 a month managing their money.
###3735 Do you have like a recommendation
###3736 for how much time we should be spending a month,
###3739 and also, do you see that prolong over time,
###3742 or once you have like, hopefully, you know,
###3744 I would love to get the point where everything is set up.
###3747 ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yeah.
###3748 AUDIENCE: Like do you see that time decreasing?
###3750 ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yeah.
###3751 So a few things.
###3751 What I just described for you, And again,
###3754 like I could have sat here for five more hours, to be honest,
###3757 was a system.
###3758 The program that we built is a system, that literally hacks.
###3763 You saw, as I was describing it, like we
###3765 make you do the 50, 20,30, because that 20%
###3769 should be going into your retirement,
###3770 and we should get that automated.
###3772 So what we create is a foundation
###3774 that runs a system that automates it,
###3776 so that it runs through.
###3777 I also then told you about habits.
###3779 And actually, the last chapter of the book
###3781 is about protecting yourself from yourself.
###3783 Because we all have pretty bad habits.
###3785 We actually asked our users to confess, and on Good Morning
###3788 America tomorrow I'm sharing some confessions
###3791 from some of their users.
###3793 Good Morning America had them call in.
###3796 So one, we teach you really good habits.
###3798 I log in, as I said.
###3799 To my LearnVest account once a day, for a minute,
###3801 just to see and track and see what's going on.
###3803 But I do spend.
###3805 January, I sit down and we go through
###3807 and really make sure we have a complete plan.
###3809 And guys, it's like anything else in your life.
###3811 If you have a plan, you will do more.
###3813 If your goals are set, which we actually write your goals down
###3816 in the LearnVest platform, so they're there.
###3819 And then you can expert that checks in with you.
###3821 And then you get awesome benefits
###3822 that are like little surprises, once you
###3824 start achieving them from us.
###3825 And the takeaway there is, writing things down,
###3827 having some hold you accountable.
###3829 That's how you end up really making progress.
###3831 And so it's not eight-- I think eight hours a month
###3833 is a lot, to be honest.
###3835 As an expert who like is a total geek for this stuff,
###3838 I don't spend eight hours a month.
###3840 But some months, maybe I will spend eight.
###3842 Some months I spend 12.
###3843 I mean it depends one, what's going on.
###3845 And then, just so you guys know, if you
###3847 want me to sign your books, I'm going to sit up here,
###3849 so we'll go through any of that.
###3850 Did you have another question?
###3852 AUDIENCE: OK, yes.
###3853 What do you think of Lending Club
###3854 as a vehicle for investment?
###3858 ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yeah.
###3859 I just think that if you're in a position where
###3861 you have like an extra million sitting around,
###3864 then I would be like, maybe something like that
###3867 could make sense.
###3868 But the truth is, of all the things
###3870 you could be doing with your money,
###3871 I would put that as probably lower on the priority list.
###3875 They of course, are like-- they actually
###3877 were shut down by the SEC for a full year.
###3880 Yeah, they had a bunch of problems.
###3882 And I'm not saying that they're like risky today,
###3884 but what I am saying is, I think that it's probably
###3889 not your highest priority.
###3890 I think there's probably safer things
###3893 to be doing with your money.
###3895 AUDIENCE: Hey.
###3896 So, I'm curious what your thoughts are
###3897 on paying your mortgage down early,
###3899 versus taking that money and kind of putting it
###3901 somewhere else.
###3901 Because obviously with your mortgage payment,
###3903 you have interest deductions, all these other things
###3905 like tie into it.
###3906 ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yeah.
###3907 So again, what we would do is, literally
###3910 run what's going on in your life through the system.
###3912 And you can actually see, it's based
###3913 on what's going on with your interest rate.
###3915 What other things that are-- interest rates
###3917 that your juggling.
###3919 And potentially, the answer is yes.
###3921 Potentially the answer may be, you know what?
###3923 That extra cash is going to be much better served
###3925 doing this next goal that you have,
###3926 because that mortgage isn't bad for you.
###3928 So it really depends on who you are, where you're going.
###3930 Do you want to sell your house in this period of time or not,
###3933 etc.
###3934 So.
###3934 Great question but the answer there is, run a financial plan,
###3938 and it tells you perfectly.
###3940 AUDIENCE: Cool.
###3940 ALEXA VON TOBEL: Go ahead.
###3941 AUDIENCE: So, I understand that financial planners
###3943 don't sell us anything right?
###3944 But do they make specific product recommendations?
###3948 So let's say I need life insurance, or investments,
###3953 mutual funds.
###3954 ALEXA VON TOBEL: So literally, our financial planners
###3955 are all full time on staff for us.
###3956 They're salaried by us.
###3957 Their bonus is only based on customer satisfaction, customer
###3961 results, period.
###3962 And efficiency of getting back to you.
###3964 That's it.
###3964 So that's how they get compensated.
###3966 Let's just say that you come in and you're like,
###3968 I need life insurance.
###3969 Just, let's use that as an example.
###3971 AUDIENCE: Right.
###3971 ALEXA VON TOBEL: We would go through and figure out
###3973 what is actually best for you.
###3975 Hey, you do need a million of term.
###3978 That's what you can afford.
###3979 That's the best thing that we can do for you.
###3981 We don't sell it.
###3982 We will then make a recommendation that
###3984 looks like this, we like MassMutual
###3987 for this specific product that you need.
###3989 And we also like Guardian, and we also like Prudential.
###3993 And then will help you go and look at those,
###3995 and then you can get quotes.
###3996 Or we'll connect you to an agent who can then get quotes.
###3999 We will not get a single dollar in that recommendation.
###4001 Zero.
###4002 It's one of our pillars of our company's policy
###4005 of being trusted and unbiased for our customers.
###4007 AUDIENCE: Right but I still may need
###4009 to go to an agent who would get a commission on it.
###4012 ALEXA VON TOBEL: You will go to an agent
###4014 and they still will get a commission on it.
###4016 That's correct.
###4016 But the takeaway there is you won't be in a position
###4018 where you go to that agent, and end up getting too much, or too
###4021 little because you don't trust them,
###4022 and you don't know what you're supposed to be doing.
###4024 And one of the things that we're in the middle of piloting
###4026 is actually us doing it for you, and you paying us
###4029 a simple fee of like $100, and we'll go get it for you.
###4032 But we are just piloting that right now.
###4034 So that we'd just say, let us do it for you.
###4036 AUDIENCE: OK.
###4037 Thank you.
###4037 ALEXA VON TOBEL: You're welcome.
###4039 Go ahead.
###4039 Hi.
###4039 AUDIENCE: I just had--
###4040 ALEXA VON TOBEL: And by the way, thanks guys for, I mean,
###4042 this stuff everyone really needs help.
###4044 And so, I'm always never surprised
###4046 by how many questions people have.
###4047 Go ahead.
###4048 AUDIENCE: Do have any recourse if you go to a CFP
###4051 and you get bad advice?
###4053 Like factually incorrect things, or they
###4056 advise you to do something and it turns out not to work?
###4058 ALEXA VON TOBEL: So--
###4059 AUDIENCE: I'm not talking about like telling the future
###4061 with like stock market or anything like that.
###4063 I mean.
###4063 ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yeah.
###4064 I mean, so first, I'd would be like, were they actually a CFP?
###4067 So let me just give you an example.
###4068 I worked at Morgan Stanley.
###4071 A lot of times, they just have people
###4073 who are just well educated.
###4074 They're actually only licensed by like a series seven,
###4077 and they like, will give advice, but they're actually just
###4080 managing investments, if that makes sense.
###4082 So like, a lot of people go and get advice,
###4084 and they'll just manage your investments.
###4086 But none of that other stuff, which is actually
###4088 step one for what you should be doing.
###4090 So the takeaway there is, I would first be like,
###4092 were they even an expert to begin with.
###4095 If they work for a reputable company that
###4097 reports to the SEC, you can complain.
###4100 And you can write a complaint that then goes on their record.
###4103 We personally will never hire anyone
###4105 with even a single complaint.
###4107 Done.
###4107 Get outta here.
###4108 We're not hiring you.
###4109 So I think that's the sort of stuff.
###4111 So the answer is, the recourse is
###4113 that you can file a complaint on their record.
###4117 But, I would then, a lot of people
###4118 get advice from people that are not experts.
###4121 Because it's really complicated.
###4122 Like, you don't even know who really an expert is.
###4123 So that's why we say, we really believe in the CFP.
###4126 There are 69,000 in the country, and I'm even
###4128 on one of their boards.
###4130 That's like how deep we are with the CFP.
###4133 AUDIENCE: OK.
###4134 Thanks.
###4134 ALEXA VON TOBEL: Good question.
###4136 Go ahead.
###4136 
###4138 AUDIENCE: You described your automated system that
###4140 tells you should do this, and this, and this, and that.
###4143 And I've found with other systems
###4145 that they are often very inflexible.
###4147 Like, they would make assumptions like, oh, customers
###4151 should not have to deal with single stocks.
###4153 They should always use mutual funds.
###4155 Or customers are generally not able to control themselves.
###4160 How much they spend.
###4161 So we assume they always over spend, or something like that.
###4164 And so I find these systems fairly useless,
###4166 because they don't adjust to my own personal habits.
###4169 ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yep.
###4170 So, a few things.
###4171 AUDIENCE: How's your system handling that?
###4172 ALEXA VON TOBEL: So actually, what's
###4172 really cool about our system, and this is like super dorky,
###4175 but just to give you a sense.
###4176 There's actually behind the system, is 44 standards.
###4178 They're literally the 44 standards
###4180 of every single person's life.
###4182 It's not in the book actually.
###4184 We took it out because it like overwhelmed people.
###4186 But there's actually a grid.
###4188 And it literally, for each step, there's
###4190 basically 15 things that are critical.
###4193 And when you get a plan, we actually
###4195 will circle what's urgent, so that you are aware of,
###4199 here are the things.
###4200 But that's when you then get on the phone with your expert,
###4202 and when we're delivering a plan.
###4203 And so it happens in the sign up flow,
###4205 when you're actually filling out the form.
###4207 But then also, on the first call,
###4208 we call it the listening call.
###4209 Where you say, here are the things
###4211 that I like that I want to do.
###4212 We'll then tell you, hey, maybe you want single stocks.
###4216 We don't like them for these reasons.
###4218 You now know.
###4218 But if that's what you want to do, we'll help you.
###4221 But we'll tell you it's like really
###4222 damaging for your finances.
###4223 You know, some people walk in and they're like, I really
###4225 like to bury money my backyard.
###4227 And we're like, I get that you love
###4230 that, we don't recommend that.
###4232 And so, there's a little bit of like a process.
###4235 But you get to weigh in on what you care about.
###4237 And also, we help you ultimately work
###4239 on what you want to work on.
###4240 But if there's something that is really critical,
###4243 we're like you are at risk.
###4245 And then, you can either do it or not.
###4247 We strongly recommend you do it.
###4248 We try to hold you accountable.
###4250 But at the end of the day, we don't force you to do it.
###4254 AUDIENCE: So once I tell my adviser on the phone that I
###4256 really--
###4257 ALEXA VON TOBEL: So it's a very flexible schedule.
###4258 So the takeaway--
###4258 AUDIENCE: So that I really want to bury
###4260 my money in the backyard, is your system
###4262 able to deal with that?
###4263 ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yes.
###4264 The takeaway is, the system literally, is built.
###4266 There's 44 standards, and they can move around
###4268 based on what the customer wants.
###4270 There's also a few filters where it's
###4271 like, this customer's really overwhelmed.
###4273 So let's give him slower goals.
###4275 This customer's a champ.
###4276 I walk in, I'm like, let's go tell me everything.
###4278 I want to know it.
###4279 I want to see it.
###4280 But it depends on, and you can decide.
###4282 So you actually, it's very much built around who you are.
###4285 And that's actually one of the things
###4287 that's a requirement of LearnVest.
###4289 You have to know your customer to a law.
###4291 You have to know your customer.
###4292 How they want to act.
###4294 What they care about.
###4295 And that form you fill out, is actually,
###4297 it's not just like us being like, we'd love to know.
###4300 We actually legally need to know what you care about
###4302 and how you want to operate.
###4303 So.
###4304 AUDIENCE: A different question that just came to my mind.
###4306 There was the previous question about privacy,
###4308 and you said you don't have any account numbers
###4311 and stuff, right?
###4312 But you do link into our account so
###4315 that we can see our balance in your system.
###4317 ALEXA VON TOBEL: But it doesn't pull your account number.
###4320 AUDIENCE: So how do you get my information if you
###4322 don't-- without having all my bank information?
###4325 ALEXA VON TOBEL: So it's as simple as this.
###4326 Let's just say you're linking your bank.
###4327 You literally, to link it, all you do
###4329 and it takes less than about 45 seconds.
###4331 You go, Fidelity, my username, my password, boom.
###4335 And it pulls in just the information.
###4337 The data.
###4338 It's not pulling in your account number, your routing number.
###4339 It's not pulling in all of that information.
###4341 But we can see at the transaction level,
###4343 so you can see--
###4343 AUDIENCE: But you would have my username and my password.
###4345 ALEXA VON TOBEL: We have your username and your password.
###4347 But we don't store your username and password.
###4349 It's just like Mint.
###4350 It's just like Quicken Books.
###4351 It's just like--
###4352 AUDIENCE: I don't know these products.
###4353 ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yeah.
###4354 AUDIENCE: But don't you update that information all the time?
###4356 ALEXA VON TOBEL: Every time you log in.
###4358 It just pulls it.
###4359 AUDIENCE: But then I have to type in my other passwords
###4362 all the time?
###4362 ALEXA VON TOBEL: No.
###4363 Once they're linked their linked.
###4364 And that connection's there.
###4365 And every time you log in, we refresh the latest data
###4367 from the last 30 day-- the last 90 days.
###4370 AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]--
###4371 ALEXA VON TOBEL: And if you had an account for like, me
###4373 from the beginning, we store all your trends
###4375 from literally day one.
###4376 And you can see it all.
###4377 It's really amazing actually.
###4380 I, living in New York, restaurant and bars,
###4382 I'm like, I live at my company.
###4383 Right?
###4383 Like I literally like can't cook, because I'm just working.
###4387 And so it was like, I never knew what
###4389 I was spending on restaurant and bars.
###4390 And quickly it was like, oh my goodness.
###4392 I can see exactly, and it's much worse than I thought.
###4395 So we can pull those trends and analysis.
###4397 But when you log in, you don't have
###4398 to re insert your username and password.
###4400 It's one time and then it pulls.
###4401 OK.
###4401 AUDIENCE: Thank you.
###4402 ALEXA VON TOBEL: You're welcome.
###4403 Go ahead.
###4403 AUDIENCE: Yeah.
###4404 I am getting married this year and I was wondering--
###4407 ALEXA VON TOBEL: Congrats.
###4408 AUDIENCE: Thank you.
###4408 ALEXA VON TOBEL: I got married this year.
###4409 AUDIENCE: Huh?
###4409 ALEXA VON TOBEL: I got married in 2013
###4411 AUDIENCE: Oh good.
###4411 Yes.
###4412 So I was wondering, if I sign up for this,
###4414 and then my fiance also signs up, can we merge?
###4417 ALEXA VON TOBEL: It's per household.
###4419 It's just you guys.
###4419 Both of you.
###4420 One account.
###4420 AUDIENCE: So we can go--
###4421 ALEXA VON TOBEL: My husband and I
###4422 have a plan, even though I'm the CEO and a CFP
###4425 and wrote this book.
###4425 We have a second set of eyes looking at what we're doing.
###4428 AUDIENCE: Even if our bank accounts aren't joined yet?
###4430 ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yeah.
###4431 Totally fine.
###4432 AUDIENCE: We can sign up under the same account?
###4433 ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yep.
###4433 It's your household.
###4433 AUDIENCE: And you guys would work with us as far as--
###4435 ALEXA VON TOBEL: You can both get on the phone.
###4436 Sometimes my husband doesn't get on the phone
###4438 because he has to miss it.
###4439 I get on it, he can get on it.
###4441 And actually, to be honest, I've been giving it--
###4443 so we like literally see it gifted as a baby
###4445 gift, a wedding gift.
###4446 We see kids giving it to their parents,
###4448 parents giving it to their kids.
###4449 Last night people bought like 10 plans for their friends.
###4452 I mean, it's really amazing how often it's gifted.
###4455 But particularly for a wedding, it's such a critical time.
###4457 Like you're dealing with all that stuff.
###4460 Our experts are experts at that.
###4462 And so you both-- and it's one-- you
###4464 don't have to buy two plans, just one.
###4465 And also, if your life changes.
###4466 Let's say tomorrow, you're like, we're having a baby!
###4469 We don't make you re-buy a plan.
###4470 We just rerun your information.
###4472 And be like, hey you now have a different goal.
###4474 And so that's why it's like a gym membership.
###4476 You pay the up front fee, it's $19 a month,
###4477 it's always the same expert.
###4479 AUDIENCE: OK.
###4480 ALEXA VON TOBEL: Cool.
###4481 
###4483 Do you have another question?
###4484 Wow.
###4485 Awesome guys.
###4486 And guys, keep me honest Annie for when
###4488 I know I have to go to the other Google.
###4489 And guys, page 11 is your dedicated promo code.
###4493 Use it.
###4494 And if you guys get a plan, I'm just going to say,
###4497 Annie's email address is a-n-n-i-e@LearnVest.
###4500 If you buy a plan today, and just shoot us a note,
###4502 we'll get you an extra free month of service.
###4504 So another free month of $19.
###4507 That's just a benefit for you guys.
###4509 AUDIENCE: One of the biggest parts of any financial planning
###4511 is taxes.
###4513 ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yep.
###4514 Income tax planning is actually six pillars of-- the CFP
###4517 is six pillars.
###4518 Income tax planning, insurance planning, investment planning,
###4520 retirement planning, general principles, and then,
###4523 what did I miss?
###4525 Estate planning.
###4526 Estate planning was biatch.
###4528 So, our experts are experts in all six.
###4532 AUDIENCE: So we just learned this, actually.
###4535 The advisors actually give like tax planning advice and--
###4538 ALEXA VON TOBEL: So as part of-- so, so, let me
###4540 give you an example.
###4541 If you have like, over $5 million,
###4542 and you're in a position where like,
###4544 you have pretty complex income tax planning,
###4547 we would actually go and recommend
###4548 that you do that with an income tax expert.
###4551 However, most people.
###4553 Your income tax planning is actually
###4554 just the basics of financial planning.
###4556 And so yes.
###4557 You do get basic income tax planning advice.
###4559 But if you're someone who's like, owns five properties,
###4562 like, we're like, you've complexity
###4564 that is beyond a normal plan.
###4566 Let's go get that.
###4567 Estate planning was actually the pillar called protect.
###4570 So we include that in insurance and estate, is pillar five.
###4573 And we do give basic estate planning advice.
###4577 Because that's things like, simple things guys
###4579 like TOD and P-- stuff that you wouldn't even
###4581 know to know about.
###4582 It's really basic things that you can just
###4584 do on your account, wherever it may be, to protect, God forbid,
###4587 anything happens.
###4587 AUDIENCE: So that includes things
###4589 like setting up trusts and--
###4591 ALEXA VON TOBEL: So if you're setting up a basic trust,
###4593 that's the type of thing our expert can talk to you about.
###4596 If you're setting up some very complex trust,
###4598 depending on again, and one of the takeaways that we say is,
###4601 we have customers who have millions of dollars,
###4603 and that we can give really great advice to and service.
###4606 But we would look at how complex you are, what's going on.
###4609 And if it's something that if you're in that situation,
###4612 and it's so beyond, we would say,
###4614 here's an estate planner that we really like, that we trust,
###4616 work with them.
###4617 AUDIENCE: I see.
###4618 OK.
###4619 Thank you.
###4620 ALEXA VON TOBEL: Any other questions?
###4622 Go for it.
###4623 AUDIENCE: Yeah, I have a follow up to his question.
###4625 Now, in your answer it sounded like you're
###4628 giving advice for income tax.
###4630 You're giving advice for estate planning.
###4632 But you're not actually doing the estate planning with me,
###4634 do you?
###4635 I mean I'd still need to get the forms from somewhere else,
###4637 and still need to fill them out myself, and still need
###4640 to file them myself.
###4640 ALEXA VON TOBEL: So here's, I'll give you an example.
###4642 So first, the income tax planning
###4644 is actually part of actually making a plan.
###4646 So I'll give you an example.
###4649 When I recommend a Roth IRA versus a regular IRA,
###4651 that's actually a little bit of income tax planning.
###4653 Because based on which one you should get,
###4655 is based on what your income is and what
###4657 your tax bracket will be.
###4658 So that's part of the plan.
###4659 Just in general.
###4660 Income tax planning is sort of a pillar of all planning.
###4663 If you're in a position where it's like,
###4666 you're making $1.5 million and we could maybe
###4669 help shepherd some of that so you could afford taxes
###4672 in like a thoughtful planning way.
###4674 That's like, high level income tax planning.
###4676 So just in general, income tax planning is part of every plan.
###4680 And then for things like documents.
###4682 So we actually get a discount at LegalZoom.
###4683 We like them a lot, because they make it really affordable.
###4686 A lot of people go get wills and end up
###4688 spending $1,000 to do it.
###4689 And we're like, you can get just as good of a will doing this.
###4692 But we'll show you exactly which one you need,
###4694 exactly how to fill it out.
###4695 And then one thing that confidentially we're
###4698 rolling out is as part of getting a plan with us,
###4700 were also starting to offer classes.
###4702 So detailed, step by step.
###4704 If you're like, how do I fill out my will?
###4706 Literally, here's exactly, those sort of things.
###4710 How do I deal with getting a mortgage?
###4712 Or refinancing my mortgage?
###4713 Step by step.
###4713 That's the sort of content that we're
###4715 creating so you can just like, attend a quick 30 minute class,
###4718 or download a webinar.
###4719 We show you exactly how to do it.
###4720 AUDIENCE: And come tax season, right now basically, I still
###4723 need to get my own CPA or do you have to--
###4725 ALEXA VON TOBEL: Yeah.
###4726 We do not do your taxes.
###4728 But we help you prepare for what you need to do, and tell you
###4731 what you need to do.
###4732 But we don't actually file them for you.
###4733 AUDIENCE: OK.
###4734 Thank you.
###4734 ALEXA VON TOBEL: Just separate types of financial planning.
###4737 Any other questions?
###4738 OK.
###4739 Great.
###4740 So Annie, a-n-n-i-e, if anyone wants to get a plan,
###4743 we'll give you an extra month of service.
###4745 If anyone wants me to sign a book while I'm walking out,
###4747 I'm happy to do that.
###4748 And page 11 is your unique $50 promo code.
###4752 Awesome.
###4752 [APPLAUSE]
###4753 ALEXA VON TOBEL: Thanks guys.
###4755 Annie, do you have some pens?
