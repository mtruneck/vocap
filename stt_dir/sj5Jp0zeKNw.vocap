###0 STEVE SPANGLER: Well, it's 1952.
###2 I'm just kind of carving a pumpkin--
###5 Whoops, oh!
###6 Oh--
###7 oh, oh, oopsie.
###10 I kind of cut myself a little bit.
###13 Little Higgins, get over here little Higgins.
###15 Use that rotary dial on the phone and call--
###19 call Aunt Mabel.
###20 She'll get us connected with the sheriff.
###22 And, uh, maybe you could put the pressure
###24 and stop the bleeding.
###28 Alright, it's 2012.
###31 It is awesome.
###33 Fake blood--
###33 that's what we're talking about today.
###35 The best fake blood ever.
###37 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###38 I'm Steve Spangler and I'm all about making science fun.
###41 For the last twenty years I've been teaching ways to turn
###44 ordinary science experiments into unforgettable learning
###47 experiences.
###48 I have an amazing team who will do whatever it takes to
###51 affect the way people think about science.
###53 And to do that, I live by one motto-- make it big, do it
###57 right, give it class.
###59 
###65 Well, you know the best thing about this blood--
###67 totally edible because it's chocolate syrup.
###70 Back in the '40s and '50s in movies and television, they
###72 just used chocolate syrup to make fake blood.
###75 It was easy to clean up and because of the black and white
###78 nobody even cared.
###79 Well, today's day and age you've got to be a little bit
###81 more sophisticated about that.
###82 So this episode is all about the best ways to be able to
###85 make the best fake blood.
###88 Well, fake blood has come a long way since
###90 the 1940's and '50s.
###91 In fact, I have a vested interest in this whole kind of
###93 fake blood business.
###95 If you saw our episode in the Spangler Effect where I
###98 introduce you to my parents, you know that my mom and dad
###101 were responsible for making a lot of fake blood back in the
###104 late '50s and early '60s that ultimately has been used for
###107 the last four or five decades.
###108 Dad even had this trick called You Do Voodoo and here's one
###110 of the original ones.
###112 This is a trick were you put a needle through your arm-- it
###114 didn't really--
###115 I don't really put your needle through the arm, but-- but it
###117 looks so good.
###118 And part of the secret was this blood that he invented.
###121 The technology was a whole lot more complicated than just a
###125 syrup and something-- a little red food coloring.
###128 This particular blood here was perfectly matched to human
###133 blood, had a flow of regular blood, and under all kinds of
###139 lights it was acceptable.
###140 See, under fluorescent light and under incandescent light
###142 things look a little bit different.
###144 The most important part about this blood is there's a
###146 special micro-encapsulation to it, so that if
###149 it got in your clothes--
###150 that it wouldn't stain your clothes.
###152 You literally could wash it right off.
###153 Unlike the blood that was the syrup, there's no way to eat
###156 this because it's not something that's supposed to
###157 be in your mouth.
###158 This blood-- extremely expensive.
###160 It doesn't clog small little tubes that the Muppets would
###163 use, for example, and some of they're little puppets.
###166 You can kind of see that this is the extreme way to go with
###169 fake blood.
###170 Cool stuff.
###171 But today how about just going to the kitchen and we're just
###173 going to use materials that you'll find in your normal
###176 pantry and be able to formulate a fake blood that's
###179 perfect for whatever application you need.
###182 Looks good though.
###183 
###186 All right, so on to classic, fake blood.
###188 Now, a couple weeks ago you can either be a mixologist--
###191 a little bit of this, and a little bit of that, or if
###193 you'd like to follow the recipe we put a link for you
###195 in the description for this particular video.
###198 Start with water.
###200 
###204 You don't need too much.
###205 So here's the water and a small amount of food coloring.
###209 Believe it not, that is the basic recipe.
###214 The problem is you're going to go through all of that food
###216 coloring and there are a couple problems.
###218 First of all, it doesn't look like blood.
###221 It looks a little bit more like syrup, because it's not
###224 thick enough.
###225 So it's too red, but it's definitely not thick enough.
###228 And the test is always on that white handkerchief.
###231 So if you take a look at it like that--
###232 See this?
###233 Not thick enough.
###234 So to that, you typically add a small amount of Karo syrup.
###238 So the goal is to make sure that our blood is edible just
###241 in case you kind of get it on your face or whatever.
###243 So the Karo syrup does nothing but help
###245 thicken it a little bit.
###247 And that seemed to be just about enough.
###249 As you mix it around here--
###252 this definitely gives it a little bit more thickness, but
###254 you can see how orange it looks.
###256 So for passing it as fake blood it's not fantastic.
###259 But believe it or not, if you go to the Halloween store a
###262 lot of the fake blood that you're going to find looks
###264 something like this.
###266 The test for us--
###267 the napkin test.
###268 So we'll put this out here like this.
###271 Put it on here and see how it looks.
###273 Watch.
###274 
###278 All right.
###278 I think it's easy to say this does not look like fake blood.
###282 It looks like orange Kool-aid.
###285 Not going to pass the test.
###286 Here's where the science comes in.
###288 As we look at this, this is a little too transparent, right?
###290 I'd really like to have something that is a little bit
###292 more translucent.
###293 Transparent's like water.
###294 I can actually see images through this.
###296 I really don't want to be able to see through it and I want
###298 to darken it.
###299 So a couple ways to be able to do that-- we can go back to
###301 our favorite Hershey's syrup, right?
###303 So this chocolate syrup down inside will help darken it
###306 just a little bit.
###307 But you try it in some small portions.
###309 Watch.
###311 That's about what we need.
###312 And now you mix it up.
###315 Again, it's starting to take on a little bit more of a
###318 translucent quality.
###320 You see kind of that chocolateness that you get.
###323 It's definitely not there with our fake blood just yet.
###327 It has a little bit-- we'd need a little bit more of the
###330 red food coloring.
###331 Here, let's take a look at this and see
###333 what this looks like.
###333 Watch.
###336 No, see it's just not there yet.
###339 A little too orange--
###340 a little darker than this.
###342 But maybe the chocolate syrup isn't the answer.
###345 So as we're experimenting, you just want to see what
###347 ingredients you can add and what effect it has so that
###349 when you make your batch you know which way to
###351 kind of push it.
###352 So instead of using just the chocolate syrup, try this--
###355 this is cocoa powder.
###357 So a small amount of the power here inside will give it a
###361 little darker quality.
###362 Watch.
###363 Again, I'm going to use about a kind of a heavy teaspoon.
###367 That goes in here.
###368 Just mix it up and see what we get.
###371 A little hard to blend it because you've got little
###373 pieces in there and so you're going to want to
###376 get this mixed up.
###377 But once it's there you can see that it has a little bit
###380 different quality to it.
###381 So when it's on this piece here--
###384 it's losing some of the redness that we had before.
###387 So I think what we're going to need to do is go back with a
###389 little bit more food coloring.
###390 I think we're on our way though.
###392 That's it for this batch, let's start fresh.
###395 Well, now that we know the basics you can start looking
###396 for some better products.
###398 So instead of just food coloring, you'll walk down the
###400 aisles and you're just looking for things-- this, for
###402 example, is dessert topper--
###405 cherry dessert topper made by my friend, Dr Pepper.
###409 A refreshing drink.
###411 So a little bit of this in here is--
###414 is kind of blood-like in and of itself.
###417 Look.
###419 Notice we've taken care of a couple considerations here.
###421 You have the thickness of that Karo syrup, you have kind of
###425 the coloring that's there--
###426 so that's not bad at all.
###428 It definitely is too thick, so it's going to need a little
###430 bit of water.
###431 So we add a little bit of water to it here.
###435 Good.
###436 And we know that it needs a little bit of
###437 food coloring as well--
###439 just a little bit.
###440 And mix it up and see what we've got.
###443 This is already looking good.
###445 All right, look at this.
###447 It doesn't have that candy-like consistency that we
###451 saw before.
###452 And we found out that if we add a small amount of cocoa,
###455 that really kind of helps it not become transparent but a
###460 little bit more translucent.
###461 So just--
###462 this goes here.
###465 Again, it's just mixing and kind of guessing.
###468 I found that the powder seems to be a secret.
###470 It really has a good consistency.
###472 And when it sits for just a little while the blood seems
###475 to be a lot better.
###476 Right now it just looks like dessert.
###479 But a little mixing and it should look pretty good.
###482 I think we need to shift it on the blue side a little bit.
###485 So again, a drop of the blue food coloring.
###488 That's looking pretty good.
###490 Mix it up.
###492 Here's one of the problems-- with all food coloring that
###494 we're using and the syrups and everything else, unlike the
###497 really expensive fake blood, this stuffs going to stain.
###500 So you have to realize that Halloween will be fun, but on
###503 November 1 you're going to look a little weird because
###507 it's going to stain you a little bit.
###508 But it's not bad.
###510 Here, watch this.
###510 Let's see how good this is.
###512 Watch.
###513 
###517 I can shift it definitely a little bit
###519 more to that red side.
###520 And I think that's looking pretty good.
###523 It's just experimenting and playing with a little bit.
###526 And there is one more secret.
###528 Because the thickening agent, which is the Karo syrup,
###532 doesn't add any color to it-- and so maybe we change the
###535 thickening agent-- and that's where cornstarch comes in.
###538 Well, it's blender time.
###539 So grab the blender.
###541 And I found a different kind of corn syrup.
###543 Take a look at this.
###544 This corn syrup is actually brown, so it kind of helps us
###547 with the color immediately.
###548 So it's adding some of the color and some
###550 thickness as well.
###551 So let's start with cornstarch.
###554 And how much, you ask?
###556 Exactly that much.
###560 I don't know.
###562 Just experiment.
###563 To that we're going to add some of the food coloring.
###565 So here's our food coloring, here.
###567 That's part of our concentrate so we use quite a bit of that.
###570 So that's looking good.
###572 I think a small amount of that cherry topping seems to work
###576 fairly well especially since it's brown and thick.
###581 That's looking good.
###582 There was a fair amount of water in the
###584 other mixture there.
###585 They had the food coloring.
###587 And now it's ready to blend.
###589 Get your hand on the top otherwise you're going to be
###591 painting the ceiling.
###592 
###595 Now as you see it blending here--
###598 looking pretty red but that-- it's not bad.
###601 In fact, that's looking really good.
###602 
###606 This is like liquid diabetes.
###608 Don't drink it.
###609 I'm going to save a small amount out because this is
###611 pretty good.
###613 You know as I look at it, it's a little too red,
###616 but it's not bad.
###617 It's not bad at all.
###619 The thing that we're going to add here is cornstarch.
###622 Now cornstarch, of course, is white and when it mixes in
###625 there it's going to thicken it just a little bit.
###627 But that white is going to tone this down and make it so
###629 it's not as transparent.
###632 So how much, you ask?
###634 Who cares.
###635 Just put some in, blend it up, and see how it looks.
###641 Lid on top, holding tight, take a look at this.
###643 
###648 Now it's not going to thicken it too much.
###652 Oh, look at the splattering here.
###655 So you can see the secret to all of this is the cornstarch,
###658 because look-- it doesn't look nearly as transparent as it
###661 did before.
###663 This is perfect.
###665 All right, take a look at this.
###666 Just a small amount here.
###668 And now on to the handkerchief Oh, this is really, really
###673 looking good.
###675 Man, that's fantastic.
###676 So a small amount of cornstarch really kind of
###678 helps it on the sides here.
###680 But I think we can darken it just a tiny little
###682 bit using the cocoa.
###685 The key here is just small amounts.
###687 So you don't want to use a ton.
###689 But for this big batch here, this much is
###693 going to be just fine.
###694 So I'm going put this in, grind it, take a look at it,
###696 see if it's good, then you can adjust it from there.
###700 And if anybody asks you what you're doing in the kitchen
###702 you just simply say, I'm making fake blood.
###704 Or if your neighbors come over you should cover yourself with
###707 it and say, oh, I had an accident!
###710 But then somebody's going to call the police.
###711 Just turn on the blender.
###712 
###715 All right, look at this.
###717 Looking even better.
###718 See?
###719 Looking better.
###720 See this darkness that's in there?
###721 And that's exactly what that powdered cocoa did for us.
###726 So that was perfect.
###727 This is looking even better.
###730 This looks great.
###731 So here-- just a small amount here like this.
###734 It's nice and dark.
###735 Take a look at this.
###736 
###738 You know what?
###739 I like it.
###741 I like it a lot.
###741 We really don't have a reference
###743 point with real blood.
###744 You can see where we started here-- a little too orange.
###746 And then moved to this area here that looks like it's a
###748 little bit more candy-like.
###750 And finally, this is starting to get into the real deal.
###753 I think it's looking pretty good.
###756 Oh, it does not taste great, but it's not the
###759 object to eat it.
###760 It's to gross people out.
###762 I'm going to add just a small amount of cornstarch.
###764 The last little piece because I want it sticking to the
###766 walls, toning it down just a little tiny bit.
###769 Again, this much looks pretty good.
###771 
###774 Let's see if this makes the perfect blood for us.
###776 
###779 [BLENDING]
###781 All right, this is looking good.
###784 It's nice and dark, sticking to the walls here.
###787 
###792 I think that could freak somebody out.
###793 If that's what they saw, this would freak them out.
###797 Uh, it looks good too.
###799 It's perfect.
###800 All right, let's see what our little blood
###803 recipe looks like.
###805 Nice.
###807 All right, well I don't have real blood to compare it to,
###809 but I can tell you that this blood here looks a lot better
###813 than what we started with at the very beginning.
###816 It took a little bit of tweaking and playing with a
###818 little bit, but I think it's great.
###820 And blood on a spoon doesn't look fantastic, but blood in a
###824 syringe would be perfect.
###827 All right, here we go.
###828 A little syringe.
###831 This is perfect.
###832 All right, so now let's put this out on to the napkin and
###836 see what this looks like.
###839 All right, and now let's spread it out and
###841 see what this is.
###844 Oh, this--
###846 that's fantastic.
###848 Look at this.
###850 That looks fantastic.
###852 I think we have the blood that we need to doctor up
###857 Higginsworth.
###858 Higginsworth!
###860 Oh, this looks so good.
###862 The little bit of mixing in the syringe.
###864 Higgins, come here.
###866 Here's little Higginsworth.
###867 Look at you.
###867 See, I told you this would look perfect on you.
###870 All right.
###870 BRYAN HIGGINSWORTH: Yeah.
###870 STEVE SPANGLER: And it's very stylish, too.
###871 All right, so here's what we're going to do.
###872 I'm going to cover you with this and then we're going to
###874 walk around the office and freak people out.
###877 BRYAN HIGGINSWORTH: Nobody's going to care if
###878 I'm covered in blood.
###879 STEVE SPANGLER: Yes they are.
###879 Are you kidding?
###880 BRYAN HIGGINSWORTH: No, you could put me in the middle of
###881 the office on the ground covered in blood, no one's
###883 going to notice.
###884 STEVE SPANGLER: That's a lie.
###884 I am swear--
###886 we need to get like a hammer came out of your head or
###888 something like that.
###888 Or you slipped and fell or you got a screwdriver and it's all
###891 over-- these people are going to freak.
###892 They're calling--
###893 I'll bet you they call 911.
###894 BRYAN HIGGINSWORTH: I'll take you up on that.
###896 STEVE SPANGLER: OK.
###896 Go lay down.
###897 Hurry up.
###897 I'm going to cover you in blood.
###899 He has no clue.
###900 They're going to freak.
###902 OK, Higgins we've got to work fast.
###903 Ready?
###904 So just kind of just jam these in here.
###905 BRYAN HIGGINSWORTH: No one's going to believe us.
###906 STEVE SPANGLER: They're totally going to believe us.
###907 Here, stay there.
###908 BRYAN HIGGINSWORTH: All right.
###908 STEVE SPANGLER: OK, that's good.
###910 OK, that looks good.
###911 Here, lay down.
###912 OK, now down here.
###912 Make your legs look like you're dead.
###914 Yeah, that's perfect.
###916 All right, so look.
###916 See this band-aid?
###917 So now here I've got this blood.
###919 So I'm just going to put this blood under this
###921 band-aid like this.
###922 This is perfect.
###923 All right, that's great.
###924 Look at this.
###925 See, I'm going to shoot it on you like this.
###927 Oh, that's awesome.
###928 All right, so let's-- well here, here
###931 hold on just a second.
###931 Let's pretend like you -- all right, so there's going to be
###935 a little bit of stuff going on here, like this.
###938 Look at that.
###939 How does that taste, Higs?
###941 Is that gross?
###941 You know, it looks better on your hands.
###944 Here hold-- put your hand out like this.
###945 Oh, perfect.
###946 That's like a hangnail right there.
###948 Like you had a hangnail and that was a problem.
###951 OK, so watch.
###952 Here's what we're going to do.
###953 So we're going to get people to walk by, and I swear
###955 they're going to call 911.
###957 All right?
###958 This is going to be so awesome.
###959 BRYAN HIGGINSWORTH: I don't think anyone's
###959 going to even notice.
###959 STEVE SPANGLER: Are you kidding me?
###961 They're going to freak out.
###962 Get ready to see the paramedics there little buddy.
###965 Oh, you've got a nose bleed.
###965 Two too.
###966 OK, so here's your little nose bleed.
###968 OK, so pretend-- oh yeah, see that?
###970 You've got a bloody nose.
###972 What do you think about that?
###973 BRYAN HIGGINSWORTH: It's pretty sweet.
###974 STEVE SPANGLER: Is that pretty good?
###975 Oh, head trauma.
###976 All right, there's some head trauma right there.
###979 That's perfect.
###980 OK?
###980 BRYAN HIGGINSWORTH: Totally making
###981 this my Facebook profile.
###981 STEVE SPANGLER: I would if I were you.
###983 OK, so watch.
###984 Let's pretend like--
###985 [SNEEZES]
###986 like that.
###987 How's that?
###987 That looks pretty good.
###988 What do you think?
###989 OK, so now I'm going to get all this stuff, and now I'm
###992 just going to hide off to the side and let's see
###994 what people say, OK?
###996 People are going to freak out.
###997 Pretend like your dead Be dead.
###1000 BRYAN HIGGINSWORTH: All right.
###1001 
###1004 [INAUDIBLE]
###1007 -What's up, Higginsworth?
###1008 -Excuse me.
###1009 -Hey, Bryan.
###1011 -Um, so anyway, I think we need to do a reset on that.
###1013 -Yeah.
###1014 -Oh, hey Higgins.
###1015 We have your order up front, all right?
###1017 We're got your uh-- a bunch of flying film canisters and some
###1021 Alka-Seltzer.
###1021 So whenever you can come up and get it that'd be great.
###1024 Take care, buddy.
###1025 
###1032 -Hey, Higginsworth.
###1033 Looking good.
###1035 Huh.
###1036 
###1040 -Bryan, I took three messages for Laura and I'm getting
###1045 pretty sick of it, OK?
###1046 I'm not your messenger.
###1048 
###1051 Excuses.
###1052 
###1054 -Oh, hey, Bryan.
###1055 Our 3 o'clock meeting's been moved to 4:00.
###1057 And you've got a little something right there.
###1060 
###1067 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###1069 -This place sucks.
###1071 All right, Higgins, you're done.
###1073 Let's go.
###1076 Come on, let's go.
###1080 Knock it off.
###1081 It's not funny anymore.
###1082 
###1085 [SCREAMING]
###1089 
###1101 -Hey, Higgins.
###1103 So how's your birthday?
###1105 [INAUDIBLE]
###1106 [SINGING]
###1107 -Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you, happy
###1113 birthday dear Higgins, happy birthday to you.
