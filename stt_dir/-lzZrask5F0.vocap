###7 SASHA GREY: It's not going to matter what
###8 magazine says about me.
###11 It's not going to matter what TV show says I'm a bad
###14 influence on youth.
###16 It's really about continuing to just follow my dreams and
###19 passions, be myself, and share my voice.
###21 
###34 I was in college.
###36 And I was working six, seven days a week.
###38 And if I was by myself, not studying, I was probably
###41 watching porn.
###42 And it was like, yeah, I like it, and yeah, I can get off.
###45 But I felt like there was a creative component missing.
###48 And I also had different ideas of what sex was.
###53 And I felt sick--
###56 you know what I mean?
###56 I felt sick to my stomach.
###58 I'm like, I'm not supposed to think this way.
###59 I was the oldest out of all my friends
###62 to lose their virginity.
###65 I was 16 and a half.
###68 I know that's funny.
###68 But I was a senior in high school.
###72 I kind of had this very male-driven mentality, like, I
###76 don't want to love a boy to have sex with him.
###79 And at the same time, I was so conflicted internally.
###82 Like, I didn't know how do I go about doing that and just
###86 feel safe and feel like I'm in control?
###91 So for me, getting in the business was a way to continue
###95 exploring those things safely.
###97 But then also, I kind of just had this awakening.
###101 And I started to really understand the sexual
###104 revolution that I so idealized.
###107 
###111 It doesn't matter what you say to your parents.
###113 No parent wants their kid doing porn.
###115 I didn't tell them until I had been here for two weeks.
###118 Because, like, I want to get down there, and get started,
###121 and then tell them.
###122 And my mom is Catholic.
###127 So that's where the guilt comes from.
###130 And my dad was just like, follow your goals
###133 and don't fuck up.
###135 And it was all in the subtext, like, I'm going to be really
###140 fucking disappointed if you fuck up, and do something
###143 stupid, and make the wrong mistakes.
###144 
###148 I showed a series of photos to my literary agent in 2007.
###155 And I had been taking photographs onset to just
###157 document my environment each day.
###160 And they were just, like, for me to look back
###162 on when I was older.
###163 For me, it was about self-examination in these
###165 self-portraits.
###167 Some of them look more like a documentary-style photo.
###171 But they were completely conceived of.
###174 And it's funny, because you could say, no, that's totally
###176 candid, right?
###177 No, it's not.
###178 Or this totally looks like something post-sex.
###181 No, it's not.
###183 I think what, for me, is kind of important is that it leaves
###186 people guessing.
###188 I think it shows misconceptions about the adult
###190 industry that don't apply to everybody.
###193 
###206 Right now I'm really focusing on proving myself as an actor.
###212 So while going out and looking for roles, the thing that
###219 keeps me really going, and driven, and motivated is when
###224 I'm not working.
###225 Because that's when you want it the most.
###226 And that's when you're hungry.
###228 And that's when you want to stand up and fucking scream
###231 and say, I can do this.
###234 So my friend and our writing partner, Anthony, is coming
###238 into town today.
###239 And we're going to have a three-day writing workshop.
###241 So it's really about creating opportunities for myself.
###245 
###248 2006.
###249 Our band, aTelecine, started making music, and we ended up
###253 putting it on MySpace without my name.
###256 People liked it.
###257 So we were, like, well, OK.
###258 What happens when we put Sasha Grey as part of it?
###261 And of course, that helped us get our deal
###263 with Pendu and Dais.
###266 I can't sing, but I sing.
###269 I can't play a cool Sabbath song on
###273 guitar, but I play guitar.
###274 You know what I mean?
###275 It's just pure fun.
###278 And it became really cathartic.
###280 
###288 I love Throbbing Gristle, Current 93, Joy Division,
###294 Parliament-Funkadelic, NWA.
###299 This is what I played this morning before you guys came.
###303 
###306 Oh, yeah.
###306 This one is really good.
###307 It's a live Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young.
###310 I'm pretty sure somebody did cocaine off of the back of
###312 this, because there are literally razor marks on the
###317 back of this.
###318 
###325 DAVID CHOE: Hey.
###325 How's it going?
###327 SASHA GREY: Good to see you.
###328 
###335 (BRITISH ACCENT) Thank you for watching Granada Television.
###338 Without further ado--
###339 oh, wait, sorry.
###340 This is Vice, right?
###342 I don't think this guy needs an introduction.
###344 
###347 This is Dave Choe.
###348 INTERVIEWER: How do you guys know each other?
###349 DAVID CHOE: That actually involves
###350 our friend over there.
###352 SASHA GREY: James wanted to paint me,
###355 because he liked my work.
###357 DAVID CHOE: Your work?
###357 That's a very interesting--
###359 SASHA GREY: It's a very diverse body of work.
###361 DAVID CHOE: I went out with Sasha once
###363 to the Machete premiere.
###365 And so every single person was like, hey!
###369 I love your work in Entourage.
###371 And I was like, wait.
###373 So what did they say before you were in, like,
###375 movies and TV shows?
###376 And they're like, oh, I love your work.
###380 SASHA GREY: People, they want to say it.
###381 But they're so polite about it.
###384 Because I look like I'll kick someone's ass?
###387 DAVID CHOE: I have a radio station upstairs.
###389 So we'll do, like, a real interview.
###393 This is a radio show that I have that's
###395 broadcast to nowhere.
###398 You'll probably hear this after the world's exploded.
###402 So is it true, this whole journey?
###404 You're very determined.
###405 You knew, at a very young age, porn, this is
###407 what I want to do.
###409 And you said, I wasn't going to do it forever.
###410 Then you got out.
###411 Now you're doing movies, TV shows.
###413 The bottom line for all of this is--
###416 tell me if this is true.
###417 You're working, doing all this stuff to ultimately own a
###421 blow-dry salon in Las Vegas?
###423 Is that true?
###425 That's the golden--
###425 SASHA GREY: That was my master plan.
###428 DAVID CHOE: That's the golden pot at the end of the rainbow?
###431 SASHA GREY: Ah, yes.
###433 Because all I care about is hair.
###437 DAVID CHOE: Probably one of the best painters I know,
###438 James Jean.
###439 We were painting her naked in Highland Park.
###442 And you were rocking a pretty big bush back then.
###446 SASHA GREY: Still am.
###447 DAVID CHOE: You brought that back, right?
###448 SASHA GREY: I don't know if I
###449 single-handedly brought it back.
###451 DAVID CHOE: I think a lot of your appeal is that you look
###453 like such a nice girl that could be, like, a model for
###456 Victoria's Secret or something.
###457 And then you always imagine--
###461 SASHA GREY: Without the boobs?
###463 DAVID CHOE: You got nice boobs.
###464 SASHA GREY: Oh, I like my boobs.
###465 DAVID CHOE: I mean, you don't look like
###466 most porn stars, basically.
###467 And you were doing super, like, violent, crazy shit.
###471 SASHA GREY: See, violence is the way you like to put it.
###475 DAVID CHOE: I don't know.
###475 How would you put that?
###477 SASHA GREY: No, I mean, I don't think I
###478 feel the way you feel.
###479 And I think a lot of people expect me--
###480 DAVID CHOE: Some of your movies were, like, borderline
###482 snuff films, I think.
###486 This is the mask I wore in Coachella for Die Antwoord's
###491 American debut.
###492 
###495 [COMPUTER VOICE]
###498 
###502 SASHA GREY: Ugh!
###503 My head is bigger than Dave's.
###505 
###509 [COMPUTER VOICE]
###512 SASHA GREY: Shut up!
###514 DAVID CHOE: Now that you're not doing porn, do you feel
###517 like there's something missing?
###518 Like, you're like, damn, I used to do fucking gangbangs
###524 and all this shit, and now--
###525 SASHA GREY: No, I think it's more about a new way of
###527 discovering sex, because there's no camera there.
###529 And I think you get so used to having a camera watching you.
###532 And that's part of what makes it exciting.
###535 So now it's about finding out ways to make it that exciting.
###541 DAVID CHOE: What are these ways?
###542 Explain.
###543 I want to know these ways.
###544 SASHA GREY: It's less about exactly what you're doing, and
###547 more about the adrenaline rush that you get.
###553 DAVID CHOE: Has it had a real negative effect for what you
###557 want to do now?
###558 Because I mean, people compare, like, oh, it's Sasha
###561 and Jenna Jameson are the two that made it out of this.
###565 But yeah, the internet exists.
###566 And that will stay with you forever.
###568 So you are trying out for, like, mainstream
###571 movies and TV shows.
###572 Has that caught up to you to the point where people say
###576 fucked up shit to you?
###578 SASHA GREY: No.
###578 Nobody will ever say anything to your face.
###581 I think right now it's about proving that
###585 I'm not just lucky.
###587 Because that's a way a lot of people perceive
###588 it as, she's lucky.
###589 She got these chances.
###591 And any porn star could have done it.
###594 So it's about proving that I can go way,
###598 way, way beyond that.
###600 I mean, sex and money are the two oldest professions.
###606 And they've always been part of society.
###610 And they've always been part of art in a huge away, even
###613 before video, or even before films.
###616 DAVID CHOE: Anything else you want to say about whores or
###619 married sex life?
###621 SASHA GREY: Your blanket looks like it came
###622 out of a crack den.
###624 DAVID CHOE: Yeah.
###625 SASHA GREY: I don't know where you got this thing.
###627 DAVID CHOE: This is my spot, right here.
###628 SASHA GREY: You just want to put the blanket over the--
###631 DAVID CHOE: That's my glory hole.
###632 That's, like, you know.
###635 I don't like to be touched during sex.
###636 I need to be under a lot of fabric.
###639 That's my weird shit that I'm into.
###642 SASHA GREY: You'd probably like latex, then.
###644 DAVID CHOE: Yeah.
###645 I like latex.
###646 I like masks.
###647 I like hiding.
###649 SASHA GREY: That's fun.
###652 DAVID CHOE: Hit it as hard as you can.
