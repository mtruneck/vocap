2
0:0:9,272 --> 0:0:10,736
HENRY SANCHEZ: Oh, I
was a punk, man.


3
0:0:10,736 --> 0:0:12,665
I used to fuck with everybody.


4
0:0:12,665 --> 0:0:17,426
Shit, when I was bored at
school, I used to draw people


5
0:0:17,426 --> 0:0:20,18
and then have little arrows
pointing at different things


6
0:0:20,18 --> 0:0:22,15
wrong with their gear
and shit like that.


7
0:0:22,15 --> 0:0:23,515
[LAUGHTER].


8
0:0:23,515 --> 0:0:28,42
And then I would show everybody
at EMB and shit.


9
0:0:28,42 --> 0:0:29,74
You got to edit that out man.


10
0:0:29,74 --> 0:0:30,78
[LAUGHTER],


11
0:0:30,78 --> 0:0:33,26
PATRICK O'DELL: Hi, welcome to
the "Epicly Later'd" show.


12
0:0:33,26 --> 0:0:36,4
This episode is about
Henry Sanchez.


13
0:0:36,4 --> 0:0:39,18
Henry is famous for
skating EMB.


14
0:0:39,18 --> 0:0:41,7
It was this spot in San
Francisco at the


15
0:0:41,7 --> 0:0:42,13
end of Market Street.


16
0:0:42,13 --> 0:0:44,56
It just was like the central
point of skateboarding.


17
0:0:44,56 --> 0:0:46,54
Almost every skater
in the crew was


18
0:0:46,54 --> 0:0:48,5
sponsored or became pro.


19
0:0:48,5 --> 0:0:51,93
And Henry was definitely one
of the most influential


20
0:0:51,93 --> 0:0:53,72
skaters of that group,
along with Mike Carol


21
0:0:53,72 --> 0:0:55,5
and some other people.


22
0:0:55,5 --> 0:0:59,58
Henry really brought in
a new set of tricks to


23
0:0:59,58 --> 0:1:0,3
skateboarding.


24
0:1:0,3 --> 0:1:2,33
Like, sometimes people get
really technical and skate


25
0:1:2,33 --> 0:1:4,94
slow, but not Henry.


26
0:1:4,94 --> 0:1:9,525
And I asked him a lot
of nerdy questions.


27
0:1:9,525 --> 0:1:12,64
This is me getting nerdy on
Henry Sanchez at EMB.


28
0:1:12,64 --> 0:1:15,52



29
0:1:15,52 --> 0:1:17,68
It seemed like the ground's
really rough.


30
0:1:17,68 --> 0:1:19,43
Like the bricks.


31
0:1:19,43 --> 0:1:20,12
HENRY SANCHEZ: Yeah, I
don't understand how


32
0:1:20,12 --> 0:1:20,88
we did that, man.


33
0:1:20,88 --> 0:1:24,835
Because back then the wheels
were even smaller.


34
0:1:24,835 --> 0:1:26,75
And it wasn't a problem
back then.


35
0:1:26,75 --> 0:1:30,4
I guess when you get better
you start getting pickier.


36
0:1:30,4 --> 0:1:32,385
Tripping on little cracks
here and there, but


37
0:1:32,385 --> 0:1:33,58
look at this place.


38
0:1:33,58 --> 0:1:34,58
It's a mess.


39
0:1:34,58 --> 0:1:35,42
PATRICK O'DELL: Like
each one of these


40
0:1:35,42 --> 0:1:37,695
little holes is a axle.


41
0:1:37,695 --> 0:1:40,37



42
0:1:40,37 --> 0:1:42,0
HENRY SANCHEZ: I always wanted
to do something different.


43
0:1:42,0 --> 0:1:45,18
But not really try to draw
to much attention


44
0:1:45,18 --> 0:1:46,45
to myself, you know?


45
0:1:46,45 --> 0:1:47,392
Just do me.


46
0:1:47,392 --> 0:1:49,305
I was intimidated because
everybody was


47
0:1:49,305 --> 0:1:52,11
rude to all the newcomers.


48
0:1:52,11 --> 0:1:54,8
And people were ignoring
me for a little while.


49
0:1:54,8 --> 0:1:56,22
And then I just started
skating.


50
0:1:56,22 --> 0:1:58,54
And if you're good, they're
going to be


51
0:1:58,54 --> 0:1:59,64
cool with you, I guess.


52
0:1:59,64 --> 0:2:2,12
THORIN RYAN: You definitely had
to be able to put up with


53
0:2:2,12 --> 0:2:3,936
people talking shit to you.


54
0:2:3,936 --> 0:2:4,74
You know what I mean?


55
0:2:4,74 --> 0:2:5,82
You couldn't be fake.


56
0:2:5,82 --> 0:2:8,9
Like, fake ass dudes just
weren't allowed to hang out.


57
0:2:8,9 --> 0:2:9,289
It didn't matter who you were.


58
0:2:9,289 --> 0:2:10,749
You could be pro, you
could be just some


59
0:2:10,749 --> 0:2:12,52
300 pound black dude.


60
0:2:12,52 --> 0:2:14,36
If you were straight up and was
cool, you could hang out.


61
0:2:14,36 --> 0:2:16,1
If you weren't, it wasn't
going to happen.


62
0:2:16,1 --> 0:2:18,29
Being a pro didn't mean
shit down here.


63
0:2:18,29 --> 0:2:19,86
You get smacked up just
like everyone


64
0:2:19,86 --> 0:2:22,2
else if you act stupid.


65
0:2:22,2 --> 0:2:24,81
LAVAR MCBRIDE: And having
your own board.


66
0:2:24,81 --> 0:2:26,63
It's just about--


67
0:2:26,63 --> 0:2:27,375
MALE SPEAKER: Gold teeth.


68
0:2:27,375 --> 0:2:27,8
LAVAR MCBRIDE: Huh?


69
0:2:27,8 --> 0:2:29,446
Gold teeth?


70
0:2:29,446 --> 0:2:31,18
Oh.


71
0:2:31,18 --> 0:2:32,95
AARON MEZA: There was like--
dude, you hear about Jamie


72
0:2:32,95 --> 0:2:35,603
Thomas who was supposedly a dude
who came to Barcadero and


73
0:2:35,603 --> 0:2:37,84
had a hard time.


74
0:2:37,84 --> 0:2:40,53
HENRY SANCHEZ: We had it
out for Jamie Thomas.


75
0:2:40,53 --> 0:2:42,442
He was a pro back then.


76
0:2:42,442 --> 0:2:43,92
I have no idea why.


77
0:2:43,92 --> 0:2:45,6
[LAUGHTER].


78
0:2:45,6 --> 0:2:48,19
It was just a local thing
or something.


79
0:2:48,19 --> 0:2:52,631
Maybe because he came to
California and we thought that


80
0:2:52,631 --> 0:2:56,616
he was just trying to juice
it too much or something.


81
0:2:56,616 --> 0:2:57,6
I don't know.


82
0:2:57,6 --> 0:2:57,77
It was really stupid.


83
0:2:57,77 --> 0:3:1,853
I actually emailed him and
apologized for whatever I may


84
0:3:1,853 --> 0:3:3,38
have done to him.


85
0:3:3,38 --> 0:3:3,512
[LAUGHTER].


86
0:3:3,512 --> 0:3:4,64
That's just how it was.


87
0:3:4,64 --> 0:3:5,585
We were assholes.


88
0:3:5,585 --> 0:3:6,92
[LAUGHTER].


89
0:3:6,92 --> 0:3:8,61
AARON MEZA: I think people
have this whole idea that


90
0:3:8,61 --> 0:3:11,19
anybody who went there that
wasn't from there was getting


91
0:3:11,19 --> 0:3:12,43
their boards stolen.


92
0:3:12,43 --> 0:3:14,36
But they would also do that
to each other a lot of


93
0:3:14,36 --> 0:3:15,63
times too, you know?


94
0:3:15,63 --> 0:3:17,13
JAMES KELCH: Yeah, yeah, I'd
throw my board and break it


95
0:3:17,13 --> 0:3:17,44
all the time.


96
0:3:17,44 --> 0:3:18,43
Throw it at kids.


97
0:3:18,43 --> 0:3:20,21
There would be posses of kids
sitting there watching me


98
0:3:20,21 --> 0:3:22,11
skate, and I'd think they
were laughing at me.


99
0:3:22,11 --> 0:3:22,68
They probably weren't.


100
0:3:22,68 --> 0:3:23,225
I was just--


101
0:3:23,225 --> 0:3:24,26
not kids, either.


102
0:3:24,26 --> 0:3:26,15
I always say the word "kid"
and people get it wrong.


103
0:3:26,15 --> 0:3:27,4
People the same age as me.


104
0:3:27,4 --> 0:3:29,6
I'd throw my board right
at their whole crew.


105
0:3:29,6 --> 0:3:31,279
Smash right into them without
them looking because I thought


106
0:3:31,279 --> 0:3:32,462
they were laughing at me.


107
0:3:32,462 --> 0:3:33,306
But yeah, yeah, no doubt.


108
0:3:33,306 --> 0:3:34,51
I probably broke a
board every day.


109
0:3:34,51 --> 0:3:35,9
HENRY SANCHEZ: It all started
with skating.


110
0:3:35,9 --> 0:3:38,7
I was a kind young man.


111
0:3:38,7 --> 0:3:41,6
I never really stressed out on
anything before skating.


112
0:3:41,6 --> 0:3:43,51
Then I started skating and I
just started stressing out.


113
0:3:43,51 --> 0:3:45,81
And then it started going
into my personality.


114
0:3:45,81 --> 0:3:48,878
Like if someone would say the
wrong thing to me, I'd be


115
0:3:48,878 --> 0:3:50,86
like, what, grrr.


116
0:3:50,86 --> 0:3:54,225
THORIN RYAN: He was the original
tantrum kid as far as


117
0:3:54,225 --> 0:3:57,15
focusing boards, and dipping
boards, and screaming at your


118
0:3:57,15 --> 0:3:59,59
board, throwing your board,
he was the original


119
0:3:59,59 --> 0:4:0,72
dude to start that.


120
0:4:0,72 --> 0:4:2,24
ROB WELSH: He was a little
stress case.


121
0:4:2,24 --> 0:4:4,6
He would just skate around
and be better


122
0:4:4,6 --> 0:4:5,33
than everyone, basically.


123
0:4:5,33 --> 0:4:7,1
He was really good, even then.


124
0:4:7,1 --> 0:4:8,3
But he would stress real bad.


125
0:4:8,3 --> 0:4:10,23
He'd fling his board around
and freak out.


126
0:4:10,23 --> 0:4:12,55
We called him "Hen-Punt."
He was a little


127
0:4:12,55 --> 0:4:13,85
asshole, but I loved him.


128
0:4:13,85 --> 0:4:15,85
THORIN RYAN: There'd be like
literally 400 kids


129
0:4:15,85 --> 0:4:17,42
skating in the park.


130
0:4:17,42 --> 0:4:20,6
And Henry, and Mike, and
sometimes Javontae would come


131
0:4:20,6 --> 0:4:23,615
through, and everyone would sit
down because they would


132
0:4:23,615 --> 0:4:24,2
just want to watch.


133
0:4:24,2 --> 0:4:26,53
I mean, even people who could
skate and who were down here


134
0:4:26,53 --> 0:4:29,38
everyday like me, you'd just
want to sit down and just


135
0:4:29,38 --> 0:4:30,25
watch what they were doing.


136
0:4:30,25 --> 0:4:31,2
It was ridiculous.


137
0:4:31,2 --> 0:4:34,81
Like the switch stand stuff
and the nosegrind stuff.


138
0:4:34,81 --> 0:4:36,5
AARON MEZA: He would just
be like, hey, let's


139
0:4:36,5 --> 0:4:36,89
just try to film this.


140
0:4:36,89 --> 0:4:38,51
He wouldn't be like, hey,
I want to do this.


141
0:4:38,51 --> 0:4:40,48
This is the trick.


142
0:4:40,48 --> 0:4:42,555
It was just like, hey, grab
the camera, let's


143
0:4:42,555 --> 0:4:43,64
get this, you know?


144
0:4:43,64 --> 0:4:45,82
But it was just that thing where
every day he would do


145
0:4:45,82 --> 0:4:48,242
something that you'd
never seen.


146
0:4:48,242 --> 0:4:50,54
Or one thing that I really
remember that he did first,


147
0:4:50,54 --> 0:4:53,6
and I was really tripping out
pretty hard and I was like,


148
0:4:53,6 --> 0:4:56,2
wow, that was super gnarly,
was he did a fakie.


149
0:4:56,2 --> 0:4:57,892
Filoed a fakie flip out.


150
0:4:57,892 --> 0:4:59,9
And you just see him
getting close to it


151
0:4:59,9 --> 0:5:1,4
right away, like, whoa.


152
0:5:1,4 --> 0:5:4,59
And it probably didn't take
him that many tries.


153
0:5:4,59 --> 0:5:7,67
But he had that terminator
board.


154
0:5:7,67 --> 0:5:8,735
I remember just seeing
it like--


155
0:5:8,735 --> 0:5:9,0
[CHUCKLE].


156
0:5:9,0 --> 0:5:10,97
You can just see the graphic.


157
0:5:10,97 --> 0:5:12,58
He just did it completely
perfect.


158
0:5:12,58 --> 0:5:15,1
MIKE CARROLL: We skated a lot
together when we first met


159
0:5:15,1 --> 0:5:15,65
each other.


160
0:5:15,65 --> 0:5:18,92
And it's weird because
I remember him.


161
0:5:18,92 --> 0:5:21,38
There was a point where he was
trying all kinds of shit.


162
0:5:21,38 --> 0:5:24,2
He was trying and trying and
sometimes he'd do it.


163
0:5:24,2 --> 0:5:26,34
And this was when we were
skating together a lot.


164
0:5:26,34 --> 0:5:30,1
And then, it's the same summer
that I went down to San Diego.


165
0:5:30,1 --> 0:5:35,31
And I came back and it was
just like, holy shit.


166
0:5:35,31 --> 0:5:39,952
Dude, this dude got
fucking sick.


167
0:5:39,952 --> 0:5:46,94
[MUSIC PLAYING]


168
0:5:46,94 --> 0:5:49,33
ROB WELSH: The best way to
describe Henry's skating is


169
0:5:49,33 --> 0:5:50,83
he's kind of like
a bowling ball.


170
0:5:50,83 --> 0:5:53,57
He was just plowing through
ledges like


171
0:5:53,57 --> 0:5:54,75
there was no tomorrow.


172
0:5:54,75 --> 0:5:57,86
And I think Henry's part of
the main reason they skate


173
0:5:57,86 --> 0:6:1,71
stopped all these ledges here
because they're so round and


174
0:6:1,71 --> 0:6:3,9
gouged out.


175
0:6:3,9 --> 0:6:5,4
It's pretty sick.


176
0:6:5,4 --> 0:6:8,1
It's like, oh, if it got skate
stopped, it got skate stopped


177
0:6:8,1 --> 0:6:9,5
for a reason.


178
0:6:9,5 --> 0:6:10,97
There's no more ledge,
anyways.


179
0:6:10,97 --> 0:6:12,14
He just used it up.


180
0:6:12,14 --> 0:6:14,66
You should go to a clip right
now, if you got one.


181
0:6:14,66 --> 0:6:16,69
MALE SPEAKER: I think when they
do that, it's uglier than


182
0:6:16,69 --> 0:6:19,16
any skate mark possible.


183
0:6:19,16 --> 0:6:25,2



184
0:6:25,2 --> 0:6:26,69
DAEWON SONG: He skated
just raw.


185
0:6:26,69 --> 0:6:27,37
He was like the raw guy.


186
0:6:27,37 --> 0:6:28,18
Raw street.


187
0:6:28,18 --> 0:6:31,57
He always did the newest shit
that none of us could do.


188
0:6:31,57 --> 0:6:34,11
He came down and you
were like, how


189
0:6:34,11 --> 0:6:35,51
can you be that good?


190
0:6:35,51 --> 0:6:35,8
You know what I mean?


191
0:6:35,8 --> 0:6:38,84
And then we were all like the
guys who just watch and going,


192
0:6:38,84 --> 0:6:40,3
all right, what's Henry
going to do now?


193
0:6:40,3 --> 0:6:41,53
And then he would do it and
we were like, fuck.


194
0:6:41,53 --> 0:6:42,907
How's that?


195
0:6:42,907 --> 0:6:43,394
MALE SPEAKER: How's that?


196
0:6:43,394 --> 0:6:44,644
DAEWON SONG: How's that?


197
0:6:44,644 --> 0:6:49,87



198
0:6:49,87 --> 0:6:52,61
HENRY SANCHEZ: I hooked up with
Guy Mariano and Daewon.


199
0:6:52,61 --> 0:6:56,6
And Guy was really cool and he
was like, come stay with us


200
0:6:56,6 --> 0:6:57,3
and blah, blah, blah.


201
0:6:57,3 --> 0:6:57,93
Stay down here.


202
0:6:57,93 --> 0:7:0,317
And that was Guy Mariano
and he was like one


203
0:7:0,317 --> 0:7:1,2
of my favorite dudes.


204
0:7:1,2 --> 0:7:2,38
So I was like, hell yeah.


205
0:7:2,38 --> 0:7:4,96
And then I went skating
with Gonz one day.


206
0:7:4,96 --> 0:7:8,1
And then Guy was like, do this
trick, do that trick, like


207
0:7:8,1 --> 0:7:9,23
tricks that they saw
me do before.


208
0:7:9,23 --> 0:7:9,68
[LAUGHING].


209
0:7:9,68 --> 0:7:12,89
And then I did a couple tricks
and Mark's like, you're on.


210
0:7:12,89 --> 0:7:15,486
It was the best day of my life
in skateboarding, man, to be


211
0:7:15,486 --> 0:7:17,7
accepted by him.


212
0:7:17,7 --> 0:7:20,119
If Mark was happy with my
skating, then that's all that


213
0:7:20,119 --> 0:7:21,82
mattered, you know?


214
0:7:21,82 --> 0:7:23,82
And he was happy with
it, so I guess


215
0:7:23,82 --> 0:7:25,96
that's all that mattered.


216
0:7:25,96 --> 0:7:28,26
JAKE PHELPS: I mean, after he
did the backside noseblunt,


217
0:7:28,26 --> 0:7:30,57
that was his pinnacle moment.


218
0:7:30,57 --> 0:7:32,81
It was like, wow,
who's this dude?


219
0:7:32,81 --> 0:7:38,12
And then everybody wanted it,
but skating was so small that


220
0:7:38,12 --> 0:7:40,4
there was no way that
people could--


221
0:7:40,4 --> 0:7:43,8
he's the guy, I want a zillion
of his boards or whatever.


222
0:7:43,8 --> 0:7:46,49
There was no marketing
behind any of it now.


223
0:7:46,49 --> 0:7:50,24
Now it's like if some guy does
some mega trick, that's the


224
0:7:50,24 --> 0:7:51,9
guy for that moment.


225
0:7:51,9 --> 0:7:55,28
And then until that time or
somebody ups it, guess what,


226
0:7:55,28 --> 0:7:58,13
you're out.


227
0:7:58,13 --> 0:8:1,51
HENRY SANCHEZ: Those were
some dark years for me.


228
0:8:1,51 --> 0:8:3,9
I wasn't too into skateboarding
and improving


229
0:8:3,9 --> 0:8:4,17
myself at that point.


230
0:8:4,17 --> 0:8:5,52
I was just sad.


231
0:8:5,52 --> 0:8:7,97
I don't know why.


232
0:8:7,97 --> 0:8:9,76
In reality, I didn't
have any worries.


233
0:8:9,76 --> 0:8:11,332
All I had to do was ride
my skateboard.


234
0:8:11,332 --> 0:8:13,555
[LAUGHTER].


235
0:8:13,555 --> 0:8:16,27
But I was young though,
so, oh well.


236
0:8:16,27 --> 0:8:18,54
But yeah, this is the place
where I could've proven


237
0:8:18,54 --> 0:8:20,26
myself, but I didn't.


238
0:8:20,26 --> 0:8:21,525
I proved to be a drunk.


239
0:8:21,525 --> 0:8:22,79
[LAUGHTER].


240
0:8:22,79 --> 0:8:25,4
I would sit on that bench
right there and drink


241
0:8:25,4 --> 0:8:28,46
all day, with Geez.


242
0:8:28,46 --> 0:8:31,6
It's like the cool thing to say
you don't have regrets.


243
0:8:31,6 --> 0:8:34,49
But yeah, of course.


244
0:8:34,49 --> 0:8:35,62
I could look back at a
lot of things that I


245
0:8:35,62 --> 0:8:36,83
should have done better.


246
0:8:36,83 --> 0:8:43,27
I should have took advantage
of the skill that I had.


247
0:8:43,27 --> 0:8:46,82
And I didn't realize that until
my skill had diminished.


248
0:8:46,82 --> 0:8:49,41
And yeah, when I look back and
I'm like, fuck, why didn't I


249
0:8:49,41 --> 0:8:51,12
just skate?


250
0:8:51,12 --> 0:8:54,515
I could've took more advantage
of the opportunity that I had.


251
0:8:54,515 --> 0:8:56,95
I didn't.


252
0:8:56,95 --> 0:9:0,88
You know Girl skateboards, I
should've rode for them, too.


253
0:9:0,88 --> 0:9:2,61
I had a lot of bills because
I was making


254
0:9:2,61 --> 0:9:4,33
good money with Blind.


255
0:9:4,33 --> 0:9:9,635
I couldn't sustain my lifestyle
or even keep my car


256
0:9:9,635 --> 0:9:11,2
or my apartment.


257
0:9:11,2 --> 0:9:15,49
If I were to ride for Girl, I
would have had to take my car


258
0:9:15,49 --> 0:9:17,32
back or something drastic
like that.


259
0:9:17,32 --> 0:9:22,47
And I didn't want to do that
but I probably should have.


260
0:9:22,47 --> 0:9:24,44
It was a dumb mistake.


261
0:9:24,44 --> 0:9:25,965
I should've went with
those guys.


262
0:9:25,965 --> 0:9:28,1
PATRICK O'DELL: So what have
you been doing lately?


263
0:9:28,1 --> 0:9:30,83
HENRY SANCHEZ: A lot of people
just totally counted me out.


264
0:9:30,83 --> 0:9:32,97
And there's a lot of lost
time, and a lot of


265
0:9:32,97 --> 0:9:34,98
making up I had to do.


266
0:9:34,98 --> 0:9:41,64
And I just felt the flame from
inside get heated up again,


267
0:9:41,64 --> 0:9:45,6
and I was on a mission to
prove myself once again.


268
0:9:45,6 --> 0:9:49,66
I didn't like where I was
standing in terms of my spot


269
0:9:49,66 --> 0:9:49,74
in skate history.


270
0:9:49,74 --> 0:9:53,57
I thought that I deserve more.


271
0:9:53,57 --> 0:9:55,37
You know, more recognition.


272
0:9:55,37 --> 0:9:57,272
So I had to prove
myself again.


273
0:9:57,272 --> 0:9:58,45
I'm already happy now.


274
0:9:58,45 --> 0:9:59,4
I'm in a new career.


275
0:9:59,4 --> 0:10:2,85
I'm a auto body tech at
a auto body shop.


276
0:10:2,85 --> 0:10:3,425
It's good man.


277
0:10:3,425 --> 0:10:5,64
And I'm going to be making
my own hot rods


278
0:10:5,64 --> 0:10:6,36
and shit like that.


279
0:10:6,36 --> 0:10:9,18
So if you're a pro out there and
you want a hot rod, holla.


280
0:10:9,18 --> 0:10:10,78
Because I'll hook it
up for cheap, dog.


281
0:10:10,78 --> 0:10:12,12
Like a sick one.


282
0:10:12,12 --> 0:10:13,115
No rust buckets.


283
0:10:13,115 --> 0:10:14,51
[LAUGHTER].


284
0:10:14,51 --> 0:10:16,38
PATRICK O'DELL: You can
fix up Brady's van.


285
0:10:16,38 --> 0:10:17,56
HENRY SANCHEZ: Oh yeah,
yeah, definitely.


286
0:10:17,56 --> 0:10:19,61
I could definitely hook
that shit up.


287
0:10:19,61 --> 0:10:19,87
I saw it.


288
0:10:19,87 --> 0:10:21,1
It doesn't look like it
needs much fixing.


289
0:10:21,1 --> 0:10:23,26
But under the carpet,
you never know.


290
0:10:23,26 --> 0:10:25,67
It could be a lot of rust and
shit like that underneath.


291
0:10:25,67 --> 0:10:30,105
But all the trim and the
interior exterior looks clean


292
0:10:30,105 --> 0:10:31,42
on the shit.


293
0:10:31,42 --> 0:10:34,24
I was actually stoked to see
somebody invest money into a


294
0:10:34,24 --> 0:10:36,73
old school vehicle like that.


295
0:10:36,73 --> 0:10:37,8
It was tight.


296
0:10:37,8 --> 0:10:37,42
I like that.


297
0:10:37,42 --> 0:10:38,67
[CHUCKLE].


298
0:10:38,67 --> 0:12:38,67
