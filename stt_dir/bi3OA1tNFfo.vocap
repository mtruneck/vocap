###16 I love photography.
###17 But I'm not really interested in a picture.
###20 There's a difference between pictures of something and
###24 pictures about something.
###25 And I wanted to make pictures about something.
###28 Because I really am interested in this idea of science being
###35 our Achilles' heel.

###84 A friend of mine sent me an email.
###88 And it was a really dark email.
###90 And I was kind of in a dark place then, a few weeks ago.
###93 Things were not good.
###94 I picked up my phone.
###96 And it said, it looks like our terrible world
###99 is revealing itself.
###101 And then I started reading it.
###102 And I'm like, holy shit.
###103 This is hugely significant.
###105 So there was definitely a compelling urge to do this.
###109 And I thought, if I do not go do this, I should just leave
###111 photography now.
###113 
###134 When I was about 14 years old, my dad bought me a camera.
###138 It was a Yashica.
###140 I'm not sure why he got me the camera, maybe as a birthday
###144 present or something.
###145 I don't really remember.
###146 But I do remember that I loved it when I first
###149 grabbed that camera.
###151 At the same time, I think magazines were probably in
###154 their peak.
###155 I mean, everybody talks about a golden age of magazines.
###157 But for me, it was really the late '80s, early '90s.
###160 And as a kid, my family, they subscribed to "Time,"
###163 "Newsweek," all the usual news weeklies.
###165 And I remember opening up, and these big huge photographs.
###168 And that was the first time where it
###170 started connecting events.
###171 This idea of history being created or made, and then the
###175 idea that somebody actually has to go out there and
###177 discuss what this history is.
###179 I started working.
###180 I got a summer job at a tabloid, the "Toronto Sun." I
###183 worked there for four months.
###184 All my friends were kind of turning their noses, oh, how
###188 could you work "The Sun?" You know, it's a tabloid.
###190 But it was the best-- one of the greatest
###192 experiences of my life.
###193 It was four months.
###194 I had never, ever, ever, made any money
###196 of photography before.
###197 And this idea of getting paid for it was really
###199 exhilarating.
###200 And then I kind of had this brainstorm that, wow, there
###204 are other newspapers and magazines in the world.
###206 And I ended up working a lot for "The New York Times," and
###209 for some German publications, which was great.
###213 So at first, when I started at "The Globe," it was Toronto
###216 and sort of area.
###217 And then as I got more experience and more clients,
###220 it was all across the country.
###222 
###227 My interest in Russia begins, I guess--
###231 yeah, I was 12 years old.
###232 Because I had pneumonia.
###233 I was bed-ridden for three, four months.
###236 The only thing I could do was listen to the radio.
###238 And I remember early May of '86 lying in my bed.
###241 And there was a news report that came on about this place
###244 called Chernobyl and a massive nuclear accident.
###247 So since then, I got kind of fascinated, I guess.
###250 And I had met some police officers in a small town.
###253 And I had met, like--
###255 I don't want to them Mafia guys--
###257 ex-mobsters, but still criminals.
###259 This was a very focused project.
###261 I went out with the cops.
###263 And they were doing their raids.
###264 And I would hang out with the criminals and such.
###266 And at that time, then the work kind of split off into
###269 two tangents.
###270 One was this idea of power and the acquisition of power.
###273 But then also, out of my, again, trying to save my
###276 childhood curiosity, was Chernobyl.
###279 Everybody thinks Chernobyl is three-headed babies, and
###281 monsters, and mutant catfish, and such like that.
###284 And when I got up there, I was really pleasantly surprised
###287 that it had completely smashed any expectation that I had.
###291 And that's when I knew, that OK, I've got to come back and
###293 photograph Chernobyl.
###295 There was a man I met named Nikolai who said, oh, come
###299 into my home, and we drink vodka.
###301 And it was one of my first sort of experiences in a
###305 traditional Ukrainian village.
###308 And the whole custom of meeting somebody and being
###310 invited to the house.
###312 And his friend Victor came over, Victor Popovichenko, who
###315 I ended up photographing a few months later.
###318 And that photograph I guess was my key moment where things
###322 changed for me.
###323 I had one of--
###324 well, press for that, he's falling over, trying to catch
###326 his vodka and stuff.
###328 And that was when the seed was planted.
###331 OK, I'm going to Chernobyl.
###332 But I wanted to Chernobyl in winter, so I waited about
###335 eight, nine months.
###336 And I went back for three months in the winter of 2006.
###340 And I had lived up in Chernobyl, close to the zone.
###343 And I just spent all my time up there
###345 photographing that project.
###346 Since then, I just have kept going back.
###349 Well I've been into the zone probably 15, 20 times, but
###352 I've probably been to the Chernobyl region itself, I
###355 don't know, 30 times or something like that.
###357 It's just something that I kind of love now.
###360 I always tell my friends I want to get a second home.
###363 And it's going to be in Chernobyl.
###364 It's quite beautiful, actually.
###367 This is one of my first projects where I started
###370 questioning the way I work, and what I'm working on, and
###372 why I'm working on it.
###374 What kind of photography do I want to do?
###376 And that's what Russia kind of allowed me to do.
###379 I'm trying to explore different ways
###380 to talk about this--
###382 an atomic world that we've decided to live in.
###385 So when Japan happened, and Fukushima especially, I
###390 thought, I have to go.
###393 Because it's almost mirroring what's
###395 happened with Chernobyl.
###396 That is why I'm sitting here in Japan now.
###400 Which is a place that I kind of wanted to come to.
###402 But I never really thought I would end up here so quickly.
###406 But obviously, with what's been happening in the last
###409 three weeks with Fukushima and the nuclear reactor, I just
###412 felt that OK, I need to go.
###414 And I see Tokyo now as the city of the archetypal,
###418 apocalyptic city.
###420 It's the perfect place for the world to end.
###422 
###431 The first thing I did notice was about the
###432 lights, that it is dark.
###434 And this idea of the electricity.
###436 And then, of course, the reason the electricity is at,
###439 I think, what did they say, 60% capacity, is because of
###442 what's happening with Fukushima, which is the main
###444 power source for Tokyo.
###447 So Tokyo relies upon what's happening in Fukushima.
###451 And what's happening Fukushima is not helping the
###454 situation in Tokyo.
###456 When I told people and said, I'm going to Japan and I'm
###458 going to do a story about the exclusion zone and what's
###462 happening there, I just knew.
###464 I knew what I was going to find because I had had that
###467 experience in Chernobyl and Zholtye Vody.
###468 And I kind of know about these
###471 wastelands which are forgotten.
###474 And it actually did meet every expectation.
###476 But it also completely spooked me.
###479 
###487 You start seeing the actual destruction of the earthquake
###490 and the tsunami.
###491 I mean, that's the really interesting thing about
###493 Fukushima, I think, is it wasn't just an earthquake.
###497 It wasn't just a tsunami.
###498 But now on top it, on a third layer, they've got this
###501 nuclear catastrophe.
###503 That was the other weird thing is that there was no police,
###505 no Japanese defense forces.
###507 In Minamisoma, they had the city hall building.
###511 There was people there testing for radiation.
###515 And the only military that was there was the
###518 guy parking the cars.
###520 
###526 It was actually a pretty normal city.
###529 I was writing an email to my friend.
###531 I said, picture your neighborhood in Toronto.
###534 And I just said-- called you right now, leave right now.
###538 Run.
###541 How did you leave your apartment?
###543 Is your television set on?
###544 Were you eating dinner?
###546 What we're doing?
###547 And that's exactly what I sensed in Odaka, that people
###551 just suddenly left.
###553 Windows open, the curtains blowing in the breeze.
###556 Going into people's homes, especially that one home with
###559 the bowl of oranges just sitting on the table and such.
###562 If people are really planning to never come back to their
###565 home, I think they're going to take that bowl of oranges and
###568 probably throw them out, or put it away, or clean out
###571 their fridge, or something like that.
###572 I think if you're given a week to leave your home, you're
###575 going to make your home in a state that is never
###579 returnable.
###581 Complete annihilation.
###582 Just this, shoo.
###584 Like somebody took a chessboard and just through
###587 all the pieces aside.
###589 And the silence and the stillness was something that
###594 I've only ever heard in Chernobyl.
###595 So I've only heard that two times.
###596 
###600 I just really think we we're the only people--
###603 no, I know we were the only people to tell that story.
###605 To go to exclusion zone and to actually see what
###609 the reality is there.
###610 And ironically enough, I had read a report yesterday on CNN
###613 saying there are bodies, yes, there are bodies still in the
###617 exclusion zone.
###618 But the bodies that are left are ones we can't get to
###621 because they're inside.
###623 And it's a radioactive thing.
###624 But we've cleaned.
###624 There are no bodies on the streets.
###626 And we had specifically seen a body in Odaka.
###630 And if we've seen one, there's definitely more.
###632 Because it was pretty much, not in plain sight, but all
###636 you had to do was walk 30 seconds off the main street,
###639 and there was a body.
###641 
###646 Wow.

###669 
###678 I've always had an understanding of who I am as a
###681 photographer, what I'm trying to say.
###683 And I've always seen my career as a body.
###688 Everything--
###689 it might take me 20 years to finally tell the entire
###692 project that I want to tell.
###694 I mean, I always try to be consistent with my work and
###697 develop it, but also maintain its basic
###701 structure, its premise.
###702 And then that's going back to our statement about what a
###705 novelist does.
###706 You really have to look at a nuance and subtlety, and maybe
###709 use allegory or a metaphor to get across a story.
###713 
###719 You know, you see people on the street, please give money.
###721 Or if you want to help the tsunami relief, this is what
###724 you can do.
###725 But I have an idea, a feeling that people just don't really
###729 understand.
###730 They're not grasping the whole scope of the potentiality.
###734 I think with the earthquake and tsunami, yeah it was a
###737 catastrophe.
###737 But you know, it's an engineering catastrophe.
###740 We can fix this.
###741 But you can't fix what's happening in Fukushima.
###743
