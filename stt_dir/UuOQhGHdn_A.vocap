###26 We just got back from North Korea, and all I
###28 can say is holy fuck.
###30 [PUNK MUSIC]
###40 Before I went North Korea, I didn't know that much about
###43 it, except for that was the last real deal cult of
###46 personality socialist utopian state left on earth.
###49 
###52 I mean, I knew Kim Jong Il was the permed dude with the big
###55 glasses who drank more Hennessy than
###57 anybody else on earth.
###59 But when we did more research, we found out that, oh, Kim
###62 Jong Il is a huge film buff.
###66 He has over 20,000 titles.
###68 He built seven personal, private theaters, and he loves
###71 slasher films, Godzilla movies, and Elizabeth Taylor.
###76 In fact, he loves film so much that he built a huge studio
###81 right in the middle of the nation's capital, Pyongyang.
###83 So Kim Jong Il, freakiest guy in the world.
###87 North Korea, freakiest country in the world.
###89 Kidnapping people to make the freakiest films in the world.
###93 This all equals freakiest film story ever.
###96 
###104 [MILITARY MARCH]
###110 Kim Jong Il came to power in 1993 after the
###113 death of his father.
###114 His father, Kim Il Song was the first ruler, slash
###118 Generalissimo of North Korea.
###122 Kim Jong Il made a film about his dad, which helped sort of
###125 smooth and solidify his move into power to become the next
###129 God, slash father, slash ultimate ruler, slash Playboy
###133 of North Korea.
###134 
###137 Kim Jong Il is known to his people as the great general.
###139 But he's also great at everything.
###141 He's a perfect architect, a perfect clothing designer.
###144 He's the best that animal husbandry.
###146 He's also the best at making cheese.
###148 He's perfect at all arts, especially film.
###151 In fact, he wrote a book about it.
###154 So Kim Jong Il builds this huge film studio in the middle
###157 of Pyongyang, but he doesn't have
###159 anyone to make the movies.
###160 So he goes out and kidnaps them.
###163 [SPEAKING KOREAN]
###164 
###183 So as most people are trying to get out of North Korea, we
###186 were trying to get in, which is no easy task.
###188 And it took us about a year and a half of continual
###191 nagging and calling before we got a tentative OK to come to
###194 Northern China in Shenyang and apply in person at the North
###198 Korean consulate for a visa to get into North Korea.
###203 They pick you up.
###204 They put you in a car.
###205 They take your passport.
###206 They take your money.
###207 And they drop you off in a North Korean bar.
###212 You're in this North Korean bar, and they're singing these
###214 propaganda songs right away.
###216 And if wasn't for my buddy Mark from the LA Times-- thank
###218 you Mark-- who twigged me to the fact that everybody in the
###221 bar is secret police, and if you don't show the proper
###224 enthusiasm for the propaganda songs, you're not
###226 going to get in.
###227 So I drank blueberry wine, got pissed, got up, started
###230 singing the songs as best as I could.
###232 And because of that I got my visa the next day, and I got
###235 into North Korea.
###236 
###255 So you arrive in Pyongyang.
###257 And your guards come and get you right away.
###259 And they put you in a car, and they take you into the city.
###261 
###266 The first thing you notice on the drive in is that there's
###268 no traffic.
###269 There's no cars.
###270 People walk everywhere.
###272 Then you drive up to your hotel, which is
###274 this 45-story hotel.
###275 But there's only one line of lights
###277 through the whole hotel.
###278 And you realize, oh, there's only one floor being used.
###282 You go into the lobby, and it's totally empty.
###285 All there is is a sort of tragic sea turtle floating by
###288 himself in this tank.
###289 
###291 We've come to a 1950s communist time capsule.
###296 Industrial wasteland.
###297 Flooding, dirt, dirt.
###300 
###303 I can't go anywhere.
###305 The hotel's on an island, and you can't leave without your
###307 guard, your guide, and secret police.
###310 The only way I knew he was secret police is that he was
###312 never on camera.
###314 But when they do take you, they take you where
###316 they want you to go.
###317 It's a government-approved itinerary.
###320 And the first place they take you is to the DMZ.
###323 The DMZ, or the demilitarized zone--
###326 which is actually kind of a funny name because it's the
###328 most militarized zone in the world--
###330 is the last vestige of the Cold War.
###332 This is the last place on earth where East meets West.
###338 This is the historical spot where the Korean People's Army
###343 made the Americans kneel down like dogs, and they should
###346 remember that.
###349 Alright.
###350 I'll tell them.
###352 
###357 So this kind of tour goes on for about three days.
###359 They take you to this monument.
###361 They take you to that monument.
###362 You don't know where it is.
###363 You don't know what it is.
###364 But you have to do it.
###365 
###368 You have to go to the House of the People, the Library of the
###371 People, the Soccer Player of the People, the Juche Ideals
###374 of the People.
###375 The People of this, the People of that.
###377 Stultifyingly boring monument after boring monument.
###380 
###384 And the whole time we're saying, hey, can we go to the
###386 film studios?
###387 Please can we go see the film studios?
###389 And they're just like, nothing.
###391 They won't show anything.
###392 They won't say anything.
###396 But they did take us to one place that really blew our
###398 minds, and that was Arirang, the mass gymnastics.
###401 
###412 You sit here in the biggest stadium in the world with
###416 150,000 kids out there, just getting ready to do a show.
###419 We're sitting on a dais generally reserved for the
###422 great General Kim Jong Il, and we're sitting here--
###425 [CHEERING CROWD]
###427 --all these people are waiting to perform for us.
###430 It's the most insane feeling you've ever had in your life.
###432 [NORTH KOREAN PROPAGANDIST MUSIC]
###434 
###454 The Arirang games are like a live version of a Hollywood
###458 action film.
###459 There's 120,000 kids that have trained for two years to do
###463 all these card changing and back flips.
###467 But nobody's there.
###469 The whole show is put on for a handful of people.
###471 Because they're so paranoid that they won't let anybody in
###474 to actually watch it.
###475 
###481 And on one side, you're kind of blown away.
###483 But on the other side you're saying, why?
###486 
###489 You have no gas.
###490 You have no electricity.
###491 Your people are starving.
###493 Yet all your money is going to the best and brightest you
###495 have in the country to put on a spectacle for 10 people.
###500 I realized, this is what North Korea is all about.
###503 It's about putting on a show.
###505 
###511 At this point, we're five days in, we've asked them 50 times
###514 to see the film studios.
###516 We're running out of time.
###517 And I start bad tripping.
###518 We're not going to go see the film studios.
###520 And if we don't, this whole trip has been a bust.
###523
