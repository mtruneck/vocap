online videos that we do,
and those videos are the


6
0:0:22,88 --> 0:0:26,9

in which we uncover

ANDREW GREGORY: I don't know, we
toured a lot as a band, but


15
0:0:55,5 --> 0:0:57,41
in a very small-scale way.


16

SARAH GREGORY: We were
definitely pursuing the arts


20
0:1:6,39 --> 0:1:8,15
in very traditional
ways when we first


21
0:1:8,15 --> 0:1:9,25
started working together.


22
0:1:9,25 --> 0:1:12,5
But then, once your imagination
gets a little


23

stuff that you can only

presidential election,


29

Michael made a video out of the
first debate between Obama


30
0:1:37,22 --> 0:1:38,7
and McCain.


31
0:1:38,7 --> 0:1:40,56

basically about the issues

coming up in that debate.

successfully made that video


36

way more fun if we could

of, the pitch correction
technology that includes


42
0:2:13,54 --> 0:2:16,99
Auto-Tune, and used it to modify
their voices so that it


43
0:2:16,99 --> 0:2:18,1
sounds like they're
singing with us.


44
0:2:18,1 --> 0:2:20,9
And then we could create duets
and melodies that we're

actually participating
in together.

we're doing, we're just

the audio magic happens,

types of sonic wizardry to

0:3:13,59 --> 0:3:18,98

accrued those skills by
