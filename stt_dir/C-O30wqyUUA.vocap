###18 SAUL: You got any whiskey?
###20 KIRBY STAR: Ah la la!
###21 
###25 EDDY MORETTI: Hi, Roman.
###27 ROMAN COPPOLA: Hey.
###27 EDDY MORETTI: Thanks for sitting down.
###28 ROMAN COPPOLA: It's my pleasure.
###30 EDDY MORETTI: OK.
###32 Where did the inspiration for "Charles Swan III" come from?
###36 ROMAN COPPOLA: It came from a few places.
###38 I had done "CQ," which is a film I'm very proud of.
###42 But the main character is very internalized, and he's not a
###46 very outgoing or dynamic person.
###50 Having done that, it would be fun to do a contrasting kind
###53 of character study, and just have a character just balls
###56 out, just showy and flashy and full of verve and panache.
###60 EDDY MORETTI: So Charles is kind of--
###62 he's just been dumped.
###64 And he and the people around him like Saul, the business
###69 manager, and Jason's character, they all represent
###73 parts of a man's relationship with women and
###77 perspective on love.
###79 ROMAN COPPOLA: Yeah.
###79 EDDY MORETTI: And Saul's character has this amazing
###83 line, something like, desire is as close as I'm going to
###86 get to happiness.
###87 SAUL: I want to be free to lay whatever girl who might be
###96 interested in an old, balding business manager.
###101 CHARLES SWAN III: You ever stop wanting
###102 the sexy young ones?
###105 SAUL: Mm.
###108 Desire is about as close to happiness as I'm going to get.
###112 EDDY MORETTI: How do you feel about that perspective on love
###116 and desire?
###117 ROMAN COPPOLA: Well, the movie doesn't have any answers or
###121 definitive statements.
###122 It's sort of an exploration of those notions.
###125 And it speaks to this thing of there's a beautiful thing when
###132 people come together that is so joyous.
###136 And there's the difficulty of maintaining a relationship.
###140 It's just a fact of life from time immemorial.
###143 IVANA: I can't believe this is how you treat me!
###147 
###150 [SOBBING]
###152 EDDY MORETTI: Your first film, "CQ," was set in the
###156 '60s more or less.
###158 And this film is set in the '70s.
###160 Do you draw inspiration from those periods?
###163 And what's wrong with today?
###166 ROMAN COPPOLA: I am someone who is nostalgic, I guess.
###169 And a lot of the things that I'm drawn to in my adult life
###173 are things that I have a connection with as a kid.
###177 I think both "CQ" and this recent film, "Charles Swan,"
###184 they were both set in a time that was very vibrant and very
###189 vivid to me as a kid.
###190 -Not these two turkeys again.
###192 What did they do this time?
###196 CHARLES SWAN III: Just pour your phone
###197 number into my coffee.
###198 KIRBY STAR: Look at me.
###200 Don't break eye contact.
###200 It's bad luck.
###202 CHARLES SWAN III: Well, if I can't get your phone number,
###204 then you should take mine.
###205 -Go hot.
###206 -Coordinates 3-2-niner.
###207 -Prepare to fire.
###208 -Roger.
###210 Standing by.
###211 -And fire!
###214 ROMAN COPPOLA: Those impressions that you have, at
###217 least for me, really, really resonate and are very
###220 interesting.
###221 And in terms of "Charles Swan," I wanted to tell a
###225 story in this kind of visual style from the mid-'70s
###228 graphic design.
###229 It's so playful.
###230 It's fun.
###230 It's sexy.
###231 It's kind of carefree.
###233 I don't think I'm too obsessed in an unhealthy way, but I'm
###236 just drawn to that.
###237 EDDY MORETTI: It does feel like a lot of these scenes
###240 were heard before they were written, at least.
###242 ROMAN COPPOLA: Definitely.
###243 EDDY MORETTI: Does music really inspire you?
###246 ROMAN COPPOLA: It does.
###248 My tastes are kind of narrow in that when I was preparing
###251 this movie, I listened pretty much exclusively, and that's
###253 not an exaggeration, to Liam Hayes' music.
###255 EDDY MORETTI: Right.
###256 ROMAN COPPOLA: That was the soundtrack of that time.
###258 When I heard "Whose Blues," which is the lead track on
###260 "Fed," which appears in the film, that had all the DNA of
###264 this movie in that song.
###266 EDDY MORETTI: Oh, wow.
###266 ROMAN COPPOLA: Because it's the sequence where he's
###268 gathering all the stuff up, the shoes,
###270 putting them in the bag.
###271 And there's this kind of melancholy, very intimate
###274 sound that the music expresses.
###276 Very internalized.
###277 [MUSIC --
###277 LIAM HAYES, "WHOSE BLUES"]
###278 
###285 ROMAN COPPOLA: And then there's a transition.
###286 And in the movie, the garage door opens, the car pulls out,
###289 and it's like--
###290 [MUSIC --
###290 LIAM HAYES, "WHOSE BLUES"]
###291 
###302 ROMAN COPPOLA: And that's the other side of this movie.
###305 And that song, to me--
###307 when I heard that, I was like, oh, I want to make the movie
###309 for that song.
###310 And I think my work doing music videos probably relates
###315 to that somehow.
###315 And the movie is a bunch of little episodes and little
###318 moments and glimpses.
###319 And I tried to tell a story in a kind of kaleidoscopic way
###322 that was more--
###324 you had a very free-form style that was able to go anywhere.
###328 And the state of mind that you can get into when you're in a
###332 break-up situation can be very confusing and distressing.
###336 Your emotions can go-- you can still be in love, you can hate
###339 someone, and all these kind of contrasting things that you're
###342 sort of flailing around.
###343 I thought it would be fun to portray that state of mind in
###346 the form of a movie.
###347 -OK.
###349 It looks like about 70% of your brain, this whole region
###353 here, is concerned pretty much exclusively with sex.
###357 You're using about 20% of what remains on your desire for
###360 power and money.
###361 This small section here is used to deal with bodily
###365 functions and also manage your affairs.
###369 CHARLES SWAN III: Affairs?
###370 ROMAN COPPOLA: I like diversity, and so you want
###372 to--and I think "CQ" has this, maybe to a fault, where I like
###377 black and white, I like action scenes, I
###379 like dramatic scenes.
###381 I like so many things, I just try to put it all in there.
###384 And so I'm kind of like that in my work.
###387 I like the scene-- like the Western scene has a lot of
###391 cuts and B camera.
###392 CHARLES SWAN III: Ivana, can't we just talk?
###395 [GROANING]
###396 I'm hit.
###397 ROMAN COPPOLA: And then another scene just takes its
###399 time to let a scene play.
###402 [MACHINE BEEPING]
###404 -Do-do, do-do.
###407 CHARLES SWAN III: Go ahead and unplug it.
###409 I don't want to live.
###410 EDDY MORETTI: The film is visually gorgeous, and the
###414 script is excellent.
###415 The writing's great.
###416 And you've been recognized as a great writer.
###419 Where did the written word come for you in the history of
###422 your career?
###424 ROMAN COPPOLA: It's interesting, because I don't
###425 really see myself as a writer.
###428 So when I've written things, in the case of my film, I'm
###433 really writing more as a filmmaker.
###435 Like, oh, I want to make this movie.
###437 And so I'm not really thinking about the word.
###438 In fact, a lot of times when I was directing on the set, I
###443 wasn't even referring to the script, because I was
###446 operating the camera.
###447 I didn't even have it.
###448 And then I would go home and say, oh shit, I forgot to do
###451 something, because I wasn't paying
###452 attention to the script.
###454 So the script to me is not precious or any kind of goal
###457 unto itself.
###459 
###460 EDDY MORETTI: Why Charlie Sheen?
###462 And how did that work out?
###464 ROMAN COPPOLA: I wrote the thing without thinking of
###466 Charlie at all.
###467 It was just something I was working on and cooking up.
###470 And I had a sense of this guy--
###473 a certain age, handsome, a little getting into that next
###477 chapter of life.
###478 And then as I was just finishing the writing, it so
###482 happened that a mutual friend put us together on the phone.
###484 I had known Charlie as a boy during "Apocalypse Now." We
###487 were kids together.
###488 And that friendship we had over those months in the
###490 Philippines, he was my pal.
###492 He was my buddy.
###493 And I think anyone who has a friend from that age, it just
###497 doesn't go away.
###498 So I had that sense of camaraderie with him, or
###502 friendship.
###503 And I realized that he would be great for this movie.
###505 So I approached him.
###507 And this is all prior to the very public kind of stuff.
###510 And he was interested but a little trepidatious in that it
###513 was a challenging role, and he had to do a lot of stuff--
###516 dance, speak Spanish, do it.
###519 EDDY MORETTI: He nails it.
###520 ROMAN COPPOLA: Yeah.
###520 And all that stuff.
###521 So he was sort of pushing back.
###523 And during all that kind of public stuff, I just never
###526 wavered in my belief that he would do a fantastic job.
###530 And I think he does.
###531 And I thought it was kind of outrageous that there's this
###534 kind of presumption about--
###536 you read something in a tabloid and sort of don't
###539 understand.
###540 So he's my friend, and so I defend him in that regard.
###543 But also, he's my colleague and a very talented one and a
###548 very loyal one.
###549 So I feel that loyalty towards him.
###551 So anyway, I'm very proud of his performance.
###553 EDDY MORETTI: His farewell speech to her is like the
###556 oddest and strangest farewell speech, because he's not
###560 begging to be with her.
###562 It's almost like he's nostalgic about the idea of
###566 their love and sad about the fact that they won't be in
###571 love anymore.
###572 CHARLES SWAN III: You know, Ivana, I was thinking.
###576 It's kind of a sad thought.
###577 
###580 I'll meet someone, and it won't be you.
###585 And I'll fall in love with her, and I'll have kids and a
###590 happy family.
###591 
###594 And I won't love you like this anymore.
###597 And I'll miss it.
###600 And I'll miss you.
###602 EDDY MORETTI: Where did that particular speech come from,
###605 writing-wise?
###605 ROMAN COPPOLA: I was involved with a break-up that just kind
###609 of was over.
###613 And there was no scene like that.
###616 So in a way, it probably--
###618 being honest, was a little bit of a chance to write the scene
###623 that never happened.
###625 CHARLES SWAN III: Goodbye.
###626 EDDY MORETTI: You're not dark.
###629 Your world view on life and love and the inevitability of
###634 heartbreak and failure and re-loving someone new seems to
###639 be almost something that you embrace and celebrate.
###643 And ultimately, the film, it ends with this amazing, I'm
###647 going to throw the whole, everything including the
###649 kitchen sink at this last scene, where all of the
###651 characters are there.
###652 And it's a celebration.
###654 Everyone turns to the camera and does that awesome farewell
###658 to the audience.
###658 CHARLES SWAN III: I'm Charlie Sheen, and I played
###660 Charles Swan III.
###660 KIRBY STAR: I'm Jason Schwartzman, and
###662 I play Kirby Star!
###663 IVANA: I'm Katheryn Winnick, and I play Ivana.
###666 SAUL: I'm Bill Murray.
###667 I play Saul.
###668 IZZY: I'm Patricia Arquette.
###669 I play Izzy.
###670 LIAM HAYES: I'm Liam Hayes, and I wrote the music.
###673 ROMAN COPPOLA: I'm glad that you feel that
###675 way about the ending.
###676 I recognize the things that are dark and unpleasant and
###682 cause suffering at the same time.
###684 That's no reason to get down.
###686 There's so many beautiful things to celebrate.
