###111 I'll try anything once, me,
###114 except bestiality.
###116 And maybe Morris dancing.
###117 Yeah, I'll try and give them aswerve.
###119 Now round here where I live, everyone's heard of Jason Locke.
###123 He'd just done a five stretch for armed robbery. Been outless than 24 hours.
###127 Mr. D. had asked me to drive him about for a few days,
###129 so I said, "Yeah, sure."
###181 We pick up this van, and Jason says...
###183 he wants to look up an old friend who he knew from before.
###211 You squealin' git! You fucker!
###215 You want some, huh? Yeah, you cunt!
###218 Please, no more!
###222 Fucking grass! Come here!
###228 Leave him alone!
###236 You fucking grass!
###241 This is what you get.
###244 Fuckin' grass!
###249 Get in there!
###259 Oh, my face!
###262 Shit.
###264 My face is burning up!
###301 Come on. Let's go home.
###303 And that was that.Job done.
###306 Jason needed a new shirt. The geezer needed a new face.
###324 Next, I take him to his mate's place,
###328 which he's been hearing things about.
###354 Fucking bastards.
###372 Lisa?
###376 I've seen his house. He's taking the piss.
###380 Nice, isn't it?
###383 Oh, yeah. How'd he get that sort of dough?
###385 How'd he stay out of prison?
###391 - You want egg with this? - No. Yeah, go on.
###395 - Would you like anything? - No, I'm all right. Ta.
###400 He had a Porsche and a Bentley, the bastard.
###402 What, a Porsche now? That must be new.
###407 - What about Wayne? - Oh, he's got a five-series BMW...
###410 and a nice little three-bedroom house in Billericay.
###423 It was a fucking mansion... great big drive, electric gates,
###427 fucking statues of lions on the gate posts.
###429 - You could have told me. - What, spoil the surprise?
###432 Anyway, so look, I'm thinking, "It's been a really interesting morning.
###435 Thanks very much. If it's all the same to you..."
###437 - And then he says, - Gonna need you some more, Billy.
###440 - All right? Later on. - And I say...
###442 - Yeah, sure. - And that's it. I've got the job.
###445 Your girlfriend won't mind, will she, Billy?
###447 You have got a girlfriend, haven'tyou?
###449 Yeah, I got a girlfriend. She won't mind.
###452 Liar.
###466 One-nine. Yes, that's right.
###468 Mrs. Knight for Brentwood.
###470 Yeah, one-nine. Yeah, on my way.
###474 - The geezer grassed him up. What else could he do? - Oh, yeah?
###478 I ain't sayin' he should have gone that far, but you know how it is.
###481 Oh, he just sounds like an animal to me.
###484 They should put him back inside, do us all a favor.
###487 He's just done a five-year stretch 'cause of this mug.
###489 - I'd have done exactly the same thing. - That's you, is it, Billy?
###492 You could do that to someone?
###494 In principle.
###500 Billy, don't get involved with this bloke.
###518 See him, Peter, oh, he's the top boy. He runs the show.
###521 Him, Wayne, does whatever Peter tells him.
###524 And Jason... Well, every firm needs a mad acidbath murderer, don't they?
###530 What do you think of my hair, Billy?
###532 - You look like a fuckin' poof. - Fuck off!
###534 What?
###536 Fuck of, will ya?
###540 It's all right, isn't it?
###542 It looks really, really fucking stupid.
###561 Can't you go any faster, Billy? I'm racing in the back here.
###564 I thought you were supposed to be Billy fuckin' Whizz.
###569 It's all come from the doors. You run the doors, and you control what get inside.
###574 Clubs don't give a shit. Just don't want any aggro.
###577 Most weeks now, we're... turning over 20 grand.
###581 - Yeah? - Mm.
###583 Fucking hell.
###586 We, uh, do a bit of weed in the week maybe,
###588 but pills is where the money's really at.
###591 I keep away from them when they're on them.
###593 Fucking eyes all go wonky, don't they? He's done 'em, soppy nuts.
###597 I won't touch 'em meself.
###599 They're not for you, Jase. They make you wanna love everyone.
###602 I love you!
###618 Pull in here, Billy Whizz.
###630 What's happened to the Honeycomb?
###632 Half a million on a refit, and it's now called Blondz.
###635 - Packed every night of the week. - Is it still ours?
###637 No. They gave it to that prick, Perry Elley.
###640 Perry fucking Elley?
###642 Yeah. It's him and us now, Jase.
###644 That fucking wanker.
###646 He was knocking out dodgy Sierras.
###648 Yeah, well, he's moved in on the doors now, like us,
###651 'cause that's where the money is.
###653 Every door he gets is one we could be making money from. You know what I'm saying, Jase?
###662 Billy.
###664 I want you to pull up outside in exactly five minutes, yeah?
###666 - Sure. - Don't fuck about.
###669 You make sure you're right outside.
###732 You all right, Nic?
###734 All right, listen, darling, I don't think I'm gonna be back till about midnight.
###738 Yeah. No, it's nothing like that.
###740 No, I'm just waiting for 'em outside Blondz in Southend.
###743 You know, the one with the glass.
###746 Nic, I gotta go.
###749 Bloody hell, they've thrown him from the bloody window.
###762 Leave him!
###765 Fuckin' leave him!
###776 Go forward!
###778 Go forward and run the bastard over! We ain't got time to fuck up about.
###804 Careful, Billy Whizz.
###811 Fucking amateur!
###813 Shit!
###816 Oh, God!
###836 Get down.
###850 You are fucking Billy Whizz.
###853 Yeah. Let's move.
###882 Well done, Billy Whizz. You did all right.
###885 Yeah, nice one, Billy.
###888 What do you think of the barnet, Billy?
###890 - It's all right, isn't it? - Yeah, it looks all right.
###892 See, I told you.
###894 And this boy knows what he's talking about.
###897 Mm, pair of fucking poofs.
###944 Nicole. Nicole.
###957 Oi, look. Ta-da.
###961 Ta-da!
###965 You said you was going to be back at 12:00, Billy.
###968 I know. I'm sorry.
###970 I've had a right result, though. Look at that, 500 quid.
###973 That's for one night's work.
###978 - Where are you going? - I needa wee.
###985 So, what happened?
###987 Well, it just seemed to go on, and I couldn't get away.
###989 If I'd known you was going to be out all night, I wouldn't have bothered coming around.
###993 - I'm sorry. - I've got to pick up Candice in a couple of hours.
###996 Yeah, but that's 500 quid. It's not bad, is it?
###998 That's just for driving them about. And I tell you what, they're well pleased with me.
###1002 All of a sudden, I have just become Billy Whizz.
###1006 It's like Billy Whizz this and Billy Whizz that.
###1009 - Better than cabbing, isn't it? - o you mind?
###1011 Sorry.
###1013 They'll want me again tomorrow.
###1016 Thank you very much.
###1019 Come on, get into bed.
###1021 Warm me up. Make yourself useful.
###1035 The following night, I'm out with them again.
###1038 Pete Chaseruns the security at Dantes,
###1040 which means I don't have to queue up with all the other mugs,
###1042 which is nice.
###1044 Billy Whizz, come on, son. You're with the A-team now.
###1065 Who's he, Billy?
###1067 Oh, my God, that's Jason Locke, isn't it?
###1070 He's just come out.
###1072 did she?
###1074 It's a simple question, and I want an answer.
###1078 Why'd you have to ask me?
###1082 It's insulting.
###1084 No is the answer. Absolutely not. No.
###1087 did you see her spending time with anyone?
###1089 Come on, Jase. I just told you.
###1091 That I know of, she didn't mess around.
###1094 What do you mean, "that you know of"?
###1107 Hey, Billy Whizz, come over here.
###1110 Stay there.
###1115 How you doing, Billy?
###1117 - Not too bad, Mr. Chase. - Call me, Peter.
###1127 - All right? - Are you Jason?
###1129 Yeah.
###1131 What you gonna do when you've finished with Jason, go back to cabbing?
###1134 Er, yeah. I mean, I thought I might do the knowledge.
###1136 - You know what I mean, do it properly. - That's a hard game, that.
###1139 All them fuckin' tests. Sloggin' about onmopeds. Goodluck to you, boy.
###1143 Well, you've gotta do something, ain't ya?
###1145 I don't like to see anybody work when they don't have to.
###1147 And you're a bright bloke, Billy.
###1150 We've been very impressed with you. Very impressed.
###1153 We'd like to make you an offer.
###1156 How about when you finish driving Jason around, you don't go back to cabbing?
###1159 How about you stay driving for us?
###1162 - What, you mean... - I mean, you work full-time for us.
###1167 What's the matter, Billy?
###1169 You saw a few things last night, Billy, but, er, well...
###1172 in my book... makes you one of the boys.
###1177 Yeah, but you know I'd never say nothing about last night, don't ya?
###1181 Oh, yeah. I know that, Billy. I know I can trust you.
###1186 It was either that, Billy, or we stick a knife in ya.
###1191 Bing.
###1197 did you speak to Peter about the business?
###1200 Pete's me mate.
###1202 Yeah.
###1204 You tell him you want to be his partner, not his mate.
###1208 He'll sort me out, all right.
###1210 Look. I know how they work. I've been watching them.
###1212 There's too many people in the chain.
###1214 What fucking chain? What are you on about?
###1216 Jason!
###1219 Anyway...
###1222 he's given me some spending money.
###1226 It's in me pocket.
###1237 It's five grand.
###1241 A thousand a year... that's all you're worth to him.
###1248 That's just for starters.
###1251 Anyway, what was I supposed to do, grass them up like Chippy?
###1255 Oh, no, he knewy ou wouldn't do that. You were a sure thing.
###1257 Yeah?And what about you? You're asure thing.
###1261 Yeah, I'm a sure thing.
###1263 Yeah? Well, you waited for me, did ya?
###1265 All that time for five years, did ya?
###1267 didn't let anyone inside your knickers while I was away?
###1269 What's brought this on?
###1271 Wh-Why didn't you just say no?
###1273 Why did you have to fuck about being clever?
###1276 Why didn't you just say no?
###1279 Because I was at it all the time.
###1281 I had so much cock I started a cock factory... big, fat, small, short.
###1285 - Anyone bought me a drink, I fucked them in our bed. - Shut up!
###1288 - Shut up! - Just for the price ofa drink!
###1290 Shut up! Shut your fucking mouth!
###1292 Shut up! Fucking shut up!
###1298 Why do you have to ask me?
###1305 Because I'm a jealous fucking bastard, and I don't trust you.
###1311 I'm sorry.
###1314 If I was gonna mess about, I'd have done it a long time ago.
###1317 Yeah, I know.
###1320 Jason.
###1322 I waited for you because I believe in you.
###1327 I don't ever want handouts from them again. We can't go back to how it was before.
###1342 You get in that bedroom.
###1346 You get in that bedroom.
###1413 I get a call from Mr. D.
###1415 I mean, strictly speaking, I'm still working for him.
###1418 He's asked me to pick up Henry and drive him to this place.
###1421 I've never been there before, some farm.
###1424 I just thought probably not a good idea to tell Jason and the others...
###1427 about where I was going that night.
###1463 Old Henry Hobbs never said much.
###1466 And when he did, hes till never said much.
###1469 Switch.
###1487 The pilotis Mr. D.
###1490 Wow.
###1492 Dropped it down sweet as you like, just like he said he could.
###1496 This is fucking fantastic.
###1499 - Can touch down and be in the air again in less than 30 seconds. - Right.
###1503 The other chap is Peter Chase's big rival on the club scene, the infamous Perry Elley.
###1507 You just keep yourself wrapped in cotton wool for awhile and we're home and dry.
###1511 Mr. D. and Perry had been hatching this one for months.
###1513 This was the final dress rehearsal.
###1515 Boys, this is gonna work.
###1519 So, John Dyke... Mr. D...
###1522 he was the one who got me into this.
###1524 I was doing me cabbing, and I picked him up one day.
###1526 We had a little chat and got talking, and he asked for me again.
###1529 I used to deliver things for him, packages, and drive a few people about.
###1532 But I didn't ask any questions. I think he liked that.
###1544 What do you make of Jason?
###1546 I wouldn't like to get on the wrong side of him. He's an 18-carat nutter.
###1550 - He's kept you busy. - Yeah.
###1554 Actually, um, him and his pals have asked me to do a bit of driving about for 'em.
###1558 Well, full-time.
###1561 How do you feel about that?
###1563 I don't know.
###1565 Thought, "Why not?"
###1567 I mean, they're all right. They look after me.
###1569 I wouldn't mind seeing where it'd take me.
###1572 I can still do a bit of driving for you. That's no ta problem, is it?
###1575 Well, good luck to you, Billy.
###1578 do you think it's a bad idea?
###1581 It's not for me to say.
###1606 Now it's starting to get complicated.
###1608 Straightaway, Peter Chase asked me to do a little job for him.
###1611 I drive 'em to this burger bar, and they tell me to wait.
###1646 Police, stop!
###1656 Armed police!
###1658 Sit.
###1661 I just lost 200 fucking grand.
###1675 How'd it go?
###1677 A total disaster.
###1679 Couriers got arrested. We lost thegear.
###1682 Pete lost his money.
###1686 Couldn't have gone much better really, could it?
###1692 - Oh! Oh, God! - Eh?
###1695 - Are you gonna see him then, babe? - Yeah.
###1697 Oh!
###1699 Now he owes you, you know that. Now's the time to call in the debt.
###1703 Yeah, I know.
###1722 What was her name again, that blond one at the club?
###1724 - Suzy. - Yeah.
###1727 She had a beautiful little arse.
###1730 You get her number for me, yeah?
###1732 Either her arse or your arse, Billy Whizz.
###1772 Welcome back, Jason.
###1777 You didn't tell me you were rich, John.
###1779 I'm not rich.
###1782 Everybody's suddenly rich while I'm inside.
###1792 It's a nice place, John.
###1797 Could easily get a swimming pool in this garden. Yeah.
###1800 Nice pool with a cover on it.
###1803 Gym upstairs.
###1807 I could handle that.
###1810 I leave the garden to Henry. That's his domain.
###1813 - Cheers. - Cheers, John.
###1818 I'm very grateful for what you did for me inside, Jason.
###1822 That's all right.
###1824 I was wondering whether I could repay the favor.
###1826 Is there anything I can do for you?
###1830 Well, if you're asking, John, maybe there is.
###1833 I've got some friends who need some gear brought into the country.
###1836 - Gear? - Naughty gear, John.
###1842 All right, Henry?
###1844 How's it going?
###1846 Been having a lot of trouble with drainage.
###1849 Clay soil round here. Water lies on the surface.
###1853 Heavy rain drowns everything off.
###1855 Yeah. Gutting when that happens, isn't it?
###1860 All right, come on. Come on.
###1862 The truth is I work just for one person now, then only occasionally.
###1867 Working outside that arrangement would be too dangerous.
###1869 And, you see, I...
###1871 I simply cannot go to prison again... ever.
###1876 Well, you think about it, John.
###1879 See if you can't get your head around it.
###1881 See, the way I see it,
###1884 people with special relationships, like us;
###1887 people who've got secrets, like us...
###1890 Yeah? Well, we should stick together.
###1893 Oh, yes, yes, I agree with you, Jason.
###1895 That's why I-I'd be, uh, I'd be happy to help you out fi nancially,
###1899 - until you get on your feet. - Mm. No, no.
###1901 I don't want your money.
###1905 I'm looking to the future now, John.
###1908 I wanna go into business with you.
###1921 Welcome home, Jason.
###1923 Thanks for keeping your mouth shut.
###1925 One or two of the boys have overdone the sunbed tonight, but we're all here.
###1928 And we're wondering what's next.
###1930 Come on.
###1944 Look at this! Look, look at this!
###1946 Hello, leader. How are you doing?
###1949 Oi! Billy Whizz, drinks. Tell Tommy to get the scotch.
###1952 The good stuff, the malt, all right?
###1954 Oi, you little sods. Hey, come on, this is not a toy. Off you get!
###1958 Hey, Beverley. Beverley, would you come and look after these sods?
###1961 Jason Locke!
###1963 Out from under lock and key at last. Here he is! Yea!
###1969 That's the color of the moon
###1972 Secretin the rainbow
###1975 Him, with Jason...
###1977 that's his old mate, Kiri Christos, the banker.
###1979 Well, geezers couldn't very well go to the NatWest, could they?
###1983 So, they went to him.
###1993 You are looking just as beautiful as ever.
###1997 - Oh! - Beautiful!
###1999 Oh, and fiery!
###2000 Oh, yes, it's that Peter Chase spouting off.
###2003 Oh, my God, Kiri!
###2005 Can you believe it? We're in our thirties. I feel so ancient.
###2008 If I looked as good as you, it wouldn't bother me much.
###2011 o you know how upsetting it is to have hair coming out your nose and ears?
###2014 That's what they should have told us in biology, not how to cut up...
###2017 What were they, locusts?
###2019 You always did make me laugh.
###2025 Jason says he wants to go into business.
###2027 Yeah, well, isn't it about time he did?
###2029 - Haven't they made enough money off his back? - So, he needs a banker.
###2032 - But he's got a problem. - What's that?
###2035 - He's got no security. - Okay. How's he get that?
###2039 Well, he needs to put up something against the loan.
###2042 Something valuable. Something I want.
###2047 I didn't know Jason had anything you wanted.
###2049 Well, you haven't been paying much attention all these years, have you?
###2057 Kiri, um,
###2060 would you just excuse me a minute?
###2062 It was just getting interesting.
###2075 - All right? - Who's that?
###2078 don't know. I just said hello to her tonight.
###2082 - Are you enjoying yourself? - I said, "Who is she?"
###2085 don't know.Just some little bird Billy's knocking off.
###2087 Anyway, it went well with Kiri.
###2089 don't shame me, Jason.
###2094 - Beverley, all right? - Mm.
###2097 - So, what you been up to then, Lisa? - Oh, you know,
###2099 getting beasted by Jason.
###2101 When they've been inside for so long, they want to do it up the arse.
###2104 If that's what your mate's been doing to you for five years, it's bound to have an efect.
###2108 - Anyway, what about you girls? - Oh, yeah.
###2110 I didn't tell you what Pete bought me for Christmas, did I?
###2113 A horse. I've called him Toby.
###2116 - Oh, he's mad, isn't he? - Put him down then.
###2119 And the horse.
###2121 I'm trying to be nice to you, Lisa. Oh, you've got a short memory, babe.
###2125 Bit too quick to forget who's been helping you while Jason's been inside?
###2128 Two hundred and fifty quid a week? Helping us out? do me a favor.
###2131 Well, I didn't expect for one minute that you'd be grateful.
###2134 Okay, Beverley. I'm so fucking grateful. Will that do?
###2139 Oo-er. You just make sure you enjoy this party tonight, darling,
###2142 'cause it's the last thing you're gonna get from us.
###2145 Make sure you keep your legs pressed tight together when you ride Toby, make you all tingly.
###2150 You do remember that feeling, don't you?
###2153 - Who's a naughty boy then? - What?
###2155 That little blond bit. That's why you didn't bring your girlfriend.
###2158 Who, her? No, she's not with me. She's just...
###2160 Well, she's with anyone, if you know what I mean.
###2163 Where is she?
###2183 Groaning Continues]
###2189 Oh, shit.
###2193 You bastard.
###2195 You do this here in front of everyone.
###2201 You bastard! Bastard!
###2204 - Fucking bastard! - Shut up!
###2206 - You bastard! Get off me! - Shut your fucking mouth!
###2209 Just fucking cool off!
###2211 Go on, fucking cool off! You think you own me?
###2214 "do this, Jason. do that, Jason." Well, fuck you!
###2218 I waited for you for five years!
###2222 Yeah, you waited for me, did you? You think I'm fucking stupid?
###2226 - I didn't do anything! - I don't believe you.
###2229 I didn't do anything!
###2233 Fuck off! You're like a fucking leech!
###2240 What the fuck do I need you for, eh?
###2243 I mean, why do you think I go with other women, eh?
###2246 Because you're a fucking nuisance!
###2247 You're not even a good fuck!
###2250 I don't even fancy you anymore.
###2252 That's a lie!
###2254 That's a lie!
###2256 Get her out of here.
###2290 You all right?
###2292 That bastard's done this to me before.
###2296 He got the last one pregnant.
###2299 Another little blond bit.
###2302 He had a little boy with her.
###2305 You see...
###2309 I can't have kids, Billy.
###2312 That was a fucking laugh, weren't it, for everyone else?
###2315 Everyone looking at me, knowing.
###2320 The joke is... I actually waited for him.
###2339 I used to sit behind him in class.
###2344 did you know that?
###2347 I thought he was God's gift.
###2352 All the girls fancied him.
###2355 But I got him.
###2359 I thought I was such a lucky girl.
###2365 Mm.
###2374 Lisa. Lisa!
###2377 Wait, hold on. I don't think we should, all right.
###2380 It's not that I don't want to.
###2385 Thanks, Billy.
###2392 Thanks for not taking advantage of me when I'm like this.
###2398 Most of the other guys would have jumped on me.
###2403 You're different.
###2406 Thanks.
###2410 Um, it's just, um, you know...
###2413 Billy. Billy, I'm taking the piss out of you.
###2417 Look at you. You're no good to me.
###2419 You're just a fucking pussy like all the rest of them.
###2423 Bring my bag.
###2450 Tell Billy the groceries are ready.
###2452 I want this over as quickly as possible.
###2509 - All right? It's all in there. - Yeah.
###2517 You fucking beauty.
###2520 There you go.
###2522 Thanks.
###2525 See you later.
###2527 Have fun.
###2534 Spotty dogs.
###2537 Seen them, Billy?

###2590 You know what this is? It's a contract...
###2593 to provide security for Blondz nightclub in Southend.

###2931 It's cold, isn't it?
###2944 Hiya. What's happened? Look at the state of ya.
###2948 - You can't come in. I'm sorry. - Why not?
###2950 You just can't.
###2952 Why not, Billy?
###2955 -You got some one in there, haven'tyou? -No.
###2957 Yes, you have. Who is it?
###2961 Come on, Candy.
###2964 - Sorry, Candy. - Don't talk toher!
###2966 Just go back inside and leave us alone, all right?
###2974 This is a fucking nightmare.
###2977 Twenty kids in hospital,
###2979 throwing up, hallucinating.
###2981 I've never seen Spotty dogs before. Must have been a bad batch.
###2984 Bad? It's disastrous!
###2986 -It makes us look like fuckin' amateurs. -What about her?
###2990 I don't know. Think of something.
###2992 You're the fucking driver. Fucking drive her!
###2995 Somewhere! Anywhere! I don't care!
###2996 Just get rid of it! I don't wanna hear about it again!
###3012 Hurry up, Billy. It'll be light soon.
###3033 It's moments like this that either make you...
###3036 or break you.
###3038 Come on.
###3041 Either you learn to live with it...
###3048 or you crack up.
###3053 Now which one is it going to be?
###3067 Henry!
###3071 Henry.
###3095 All right, John?
###3102 do you think I'd try and stiff you?
###3104 Do you think I'm mad?
###3107 It was a bad batch. There was nothing I could do.
###3111 You know, when I was inside,
###3115 I heard this screaming one day.
###3117 So I went to have a look, and I found yke here...
###3120 bent over the table with his trousers round his ankles,
###3124 four big, hairy paddies holding him down, about to bugger him.
###3128 Old Henry, he's off playing bingo. Ain't that right, Henry?
###3139 Please. Please, Jason, don't do...
###3143 don't do anything stupid.
###3147 That was the first time I met you, wasn't it?
###3149 Well, in a little while,
###3151 you're gonna be wishing I'd walk straight past you that day...
###3153 - and just let 'em get on with it. - I'm sorry.
###3156 I'm sorry, Jason. I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
###3166 You've got 48 hours to get me my money back...
###3170 and the profit we lost.
###3172 You fucking worm!
###3226 What you gonna do about Lisa?
###3228 Fuck all!
###3231 - Hey, Billy Whizz, have you seen her? - No.
###3235 Where'd you take her then? You drove her away.
###3238 I brought her back here and I went home.
###3240 Leave her. She'll come back with her tail between her legs,
###3243 -likes he always does. - What about that other business?
###3244 - You sort that out as well? - Yeah.
###3249 - Where did you dump it? - I sorted it out.
###3251 That's all you need to know.
###3255 - You ought to watch your fucking mouth. - Leave him.
###3258 - No! Fucking kid! - Leave him, leave him. Come on.
###3261 Billy, which one do you want, eh?
###3265 Huh? You can have first choice,
###3268 as long as it's not the blond one.
###3271 Um, I'll pass, thanks.
###3277 Is it all right if I see you lot later?
###3281 Which one, Billy? Where you going?
###3284 I'm going home. I'm tired.
###3288 - You're not leaving. - Look, I've had enough. I want out.
###3291 You don't want out on me, you skinny, little prick!
###3294 Now I said, which one do you want, eh?
###3298 This one? Eh?
###3301 do you want this one, or do you want this one, eh?
###3305 No? Well, why not do 'em both, eh?
###3308 Now get in there and don't fucking come out till you've done 'em!
###3318 You know, I went to that place... what's it called?
###3321 Lakeside last week.
###3324 I spent the whole afternoon in a tea shop just watching.
###3327 Something about the women in that part of the world that I find absolutely irresistible.
###3332 Thought you were only interested in Henry.
###3337 No, they're fiercely pretty, yet hard as nails,
###3341 and it's a perfect combination.
###3345 What I wouldn't give to have my youth again in Essex.
###3351 All I remember of my youth is getting freezing cold under Southend Pier...
###3354 with me knickers around me ankles.
###3358 Well, I'll take you under that pier again.
###3361 You can haveyour knickers around your ankles again.
###3368 You know, I'm gonna have to go back to him, don'tyou?
###3375 You know, I'm just about to do something... really big.
###3381 After that, I'll be able to pay them of,
###3382 and I'll still be a very rich man.
###3385 We could go somewhere where he'd never find us.
###3402 It's just a little investment. Spreading out the old tentacles, youknow.
###3406 Had bit of spare cash laying about,
###3408 and I fucking hate waiting for cabs, so why not?
###3412 - Perry. - Oh, thanks, darling.
###3415 -did you, uh, watch 'em make it? - Yeah. Smoked salmon?
###3418 Yeah, great.
###3421 You know they gob in these things in those places.
###3426 So, what happened to your face?
###3429 Oh, I, I, uh... I had some, um...
###3432 - I had some problems the other night. - Uh-huh.
###3435 - So speak to me. - Well, I just wanted to talk about the drop,
###3438 make sure everything's going to plan.
###3440 Oh, yeah. Everything's still going to plan, John,
###3444 except for one small detail.
###3446 You're no longer part of that plan.
###3450 What's the matter? You think I don't know about things?
###3453 Perry, I need this job. We've been friends for a long time.
###3455 Are you taking me for a cunt, John?
###3457 Perry, that was a one-off.
###3460 John, are you taking me for a cunt?
###3463 - It's a very simple little question. - No. No, of course not.
###3466 Well, listen. Take my advice and fuck off right now...
###3471 before I lose my temper, all right?
###3473 Perry, you... you can't just cut me out.
###3478 Can't? Can't?
###3481 You just watch me.
###3483 The minute that you do business with those fuckers, you become dirty.
###3487 I can no longer trust you.
###3489 So now... you're gone.
###3494 Fuck off.
###3497 Nothing personal, John.
###3505 I haven't got your money.
###3508 But I've got something better, a new proposition.
###3510 Something that will be worth much more.
###3512 -It'll make you a million each. Minimum. -Come on, Jason.
###3514 Let's listen to what he's gotta say.
###3517 Perry Elley is flying in a consignment of coke.
###3520 - A big one. - Mm-hmm.
###3522 I know when and where the drop is going to be made.
###3525 I can put you in the right place at the right time to hit the courier.
###3530 We divide the consignment into four,
###3533 and that's a million a piece.
###3537 And we get to whack Perry Elley.
###3539 It's perfect.
###3541 There are two stipulations.
###3543 Stipulations? Like what?
###3546 First, this wipes the slate clean.
###3552 And?
###3555 And we never cross each other's paths again.
###3570 Why not? Who wants to see you again anyway?
###3601 So, now they're all in it together.
###3604 A nice little jolly boys outing.
###3664 Well, we're gonna need a four-wheel drive, ain't we?
###3681 The plane will come in over the top of those trees,
###3685 and the pilot will probably set it down in that stretch of field over there.
###3688 They have runway lights that flick on at the last moment.
###3692 Oh, yeah? Well, what if it's raining then, like tonight?
###3695 Shouldn't make any difference.
###3698 Well, we can hole up over there for a couple of hours before they make the drop.
###3703 Yeah. Get here nice and early.
###3708 And then boom, boom, fucking boom.
###3711 Take out the reception committee...
###3714 and the courier.
###3717 We'll need automatic weapons and night sights.
###3722 Yeah, we can do this.
###3728 - When then? - Oh.
###3731 Soon.
###3734 Look, I've, uh... I got the keys to the, uh, to the gate here.
###3737 You won't want me around, will you?
###3739 It's not my scene, really.
###3741 What's the matter, ykey? Squeamish?
###3745 This is a field. This is where worms belong.
###3749 I wouldn't let you miss this, not for the world.
###3753 That goes for you too, Billy Whizz.
###3768 Who wants to be a millionaire
###3771 We do
###3775 Who wants to be a millionaire We do
###3779 There's no way we're gonna chuck it all away, not what we've got.
###3781 - Good. - Yeah. I mean, we're really great together.
###3785 Get us another bottle, will you, babe?
###3790 Come here.
###3793 You know, we've discovered the secret...
###3796 to a happy relationship, haven't we, Lisa?
###3798 I do what I want, and she does what I tell her.
###3803 That's what works for us.
###3805 And a back hander every now and then.
###3809 Only it's important to have a secret when they get to this age, you know.
###3812 Once they get past 30, they start getting saggy, you know?
###3817 imples in their arses, eh, Lisa?
###3823 And their tits start to hang down.
###3827 And they still wear frilly underwear, but it don'tlook very nice, no.
###3836 But I tell you, they're still handy for carrying and fetching.
###3841 Now go on, get some glasses.
###3844 Billy Whizz, give her a hand.
###3862 He's a fucking arsehole.
###3864 Forget it. I can handle him.
###3867 When this all comes off, perhaps you should bury the hatchet with yke.
###3870 - He could be useful. - Oh, I'll bury it in his fucking head.
###3876 Look, I've made up me mind.
###3879 We hit yke and have his share between us.
###3882 About the other night, I'm really sorry for what I said.
###3885 I was hurt, and when I'm hurt, I lash out.
###3888 You just happened to be in the way.
###3890 - Are we still friends? - Yeah, no problem.
###3894 What about Billy Whizz? Can we trust him?
###3900 No. Better do him and all.
###3956 Evening, Billy.
###3981 How many of them will there be?
###3984 About three or four, I should think.
###3989 They'll all have to be taken out.
###3997 Fucking hell.
###4028 Wish me luck.
###4033 All right, Billy Whizz! You wanker!
###4046 Heckler & Koch MP5.
###4049 Fires a standard 9mm Parabellum round.
###4051 Thirty rounds a magazine, eight hundred rounds a minute on full auto.
###4055 Fucking quality.
###4058 We couldn't get the night sights,
###4060 so we're just gonna have to get in close, eh?
###4064 Shall we go?
###4066 What's up, Mr. Worm?
###4076 Who wants to be a millionaire
###4078 We do, we do
###4080 - Who do? - We do!
###4082 Yeah!
###4150 I'll get the gate, shall I?
###4180 Boom.
###4190 Hello.
###4192 Where are you? You sound funny.
###4197 Yeah? Yeah, get a couple of bottles.
###4228 Shut up, Billy!
###4230 There's no need for this, John.
###4232 You can keep it all.
###4233 Oh, Jason, you foolish, greedy boy.
###4237 There are no drugs.
###4240 There is noplane.
###4242 You want to mess with me? You're not in the same league.
###4247 I thought we were mates.
###4249 I looked after you in prison.
###4251 I'm a man of honor, Jason. I always pay my debts.
###4253 Please.
###4256 This is silly.
###4258 Billy, you said you wanted to know how far this was going to take you.
###4262 - No! don't! - Hold it, John.
###4278 - Leave him, Henry. - He's a witness.
###4280 I'm not having this little bastard hanging over me.
###4284 No, no, no. Leave him alone, Henry.
###4292 That's enough for tonight.
###4324 Who wants to be a millionaire
###4328 They don't
###4412 Hello, Billy. Yeah, come in.
###4416 You can listen to this.
###4418 Obviously, if you don't mind, Lisa.
###4420 I had no idea where Jason was going that night.
###4422 Yeah, but... That's weird though, isn't it? It's not very romantic, is it?
###4425 He'd been out of prison for, what, two weeks?
###4429 I mean, he's hanging out with all sorts of strange people, leaving you here home alone.
###4433 Don't know who he's with, where he is.
###4435 My husband fucked around. Is that what you want to hear?
###4441 - You ever heard of Suzy Welch? - Who?
###4444 Suzy Welch. Young girl.
###4448 Very pretty.
###4452 on't know whether your husband associated with her in the last couple of weeks, do you?
###4456 It's possible.
###4458 If she had a cute arse, it's certainly possible.
###4460 Hmm. She disappeared.
###4464 And you think Jason's death may have something to do with it?
###4466 Some one killed him because of her?
###4468 Thanks. Makes me feel really great.
###4469 Oh. I've upset you now, ain't I?
###4472 I didn't mean to do that.
###4475 All right. I'll leavey ou here.
###4479 Leave you two in your grief.
###4482 Billy.
###4486 Used to drive for Jason, didn't you?
###4488 Yeah, now and again, but not that night, obviously.
###4491 Obviously.
###4495 I'll be in touch.
###4525 You didn't think I'd go through with it, did you? Admit it.
###4528 No.
###4531 I did it for you.
###4534 Where have you been? I've been waiting for two hours.
###4538 I've had the police around.
###4540 - I'm sorry. - It worries me how much they know.
###4544 Oh, what can they know? They know nothing.
###4546 The only people who can tell them anything... can't speak.
###4549 Billy can. They know he drove for Jason.
###4553 No. Billy's all right. on't worry about Billy.
###4555 You sure you can trust him?
###4557 No. He's too scared to say anything.
###4561 So, how are you?
###4563 Is the burden of knowledge weighing you down?
###4566 No. I'm fine.
###4568 It's like I told you, Billy.
###4570 It's moments like this that will make you...
###4575 or break you.
###4577 Have the police been to see you?
###4580 Yeah. There was a smart arse Old Bill around Lisa's.
###4582 - What did he ask you? - Nothing.
###4584 - He just give me his card and said he'd get in touch. - Good.
###4587 We must expect this, Billy. It's perfectly normal.
###4589 They'll be questioning all his associates.
###4591 I'm sure they'll be talking to me at some point.
###4593 The situation is very simple, Billy.
###4597 The only people who know what happened...
###4599 are you, me and Henry.
###4603 The other people who knew...
###4605 are, of course, dead.
###4608 Mr... you know, I... I, like...
###4610 I wouldn't say a word about this to anyone.
###4615 Look. All this work for a drainage trench.
###4620 Can you believe how obsessed Henry gets about this garden?
###4626 I'm bringing a shipment in this week.
###4630 I wanted to make sure I could rely on you.
###4633 Y-Yeah, ofcourse. Nothing's changed.
###4635 Now tell me, how's Lisa? I haven't seen her for awhile.
###4639 Uh, she's a bit upset.
###4643 I want you to, uh, look after her a bit.
###4647 drive her around, make sure she doesn't come to any harm.
###4652 I'm worried about her.
###4665 I'm taking over the business, Beverley.
###4667 - I want the books. - Go fuck yourself.
###4669 Lend me one of your vibrators, and I will.
###4671 Which one's been your favorite since Peter got splattered?
###4673 You bitch!
###4675 Fucking try that again, I'll fucking do you!
###4678 What gives you the right to think you can just come in here and take over?
###4683 'Cause who's gonna stop me? You, Beverley?
###4686 don't make me laugh. Look at you.
###4689 This place. This stuff.
###4691 You got your drinks trolley, chandelier, piano.
###4694 Can you even play the piano, Beverley?
###4696 And how'd you get all of this, eh? Of of Jason's back.
###4699 - That's how. - You're the one's who's got everything on your back.
###4702 don't annoy me, Beverley. The terms are getting worse all the time.
###4705 Now, you can keep this house and the cars.
###4707 I'm taking over the doors. If you have a problem with that,
###4710 you can have a chat with Kiri Christos about the money you owe him.
###4713 What am I supposed to live on?
###4716 Yeah.
###4718 I've been thinking about that.
###4727 250 quid a week.
###4729 Remember? That's what Peter was paying me when Jason was inside.
###4734 That's when he wasn't trying to get inside my knickers.
###4737 Fair's fair, eh, Beverley?
###4781 Where now?
###4835 I keep turning it over and over in my mind.
###4839 I must have been speaking to him just before he died.
###4842 Yeah?
###4846 - Where were you, Billy? - Me? I was at home watching the telly.
###4850 Well, I knew they were planning something.
###4852 Why didn't they want you to drive 'em?
###4854 don't know. They were all very secretive about it.
###4856 - You wouldn't lie to me, would you, Billy? - I weren't there.
###4861 So, who do you think done it?
###4863 don't know. Perry Elley?
###4866 What about John yke? do you think he could have had anything to do with it?
###4869 No. Mr...? No. Why, do you?
###4875 I don't know.
###4877 There's just something about him that's not quite right.
###4929 Lisa, there's...
###4933 - there's something I gotta tell ya. - What?
###4935 It's been playing on my mind.
###4938 What has?
###4940 It's about Jason.
###4942 And just, like...
###4944 The way he died.
###4950 How did he die, Billy?
###4954 I just...
###4956 I just keep thinking it... it's gonna happen to you and me.
###4968 - Hello? - Billy, the groceries are ready.
###4972 Oh, right, yeah. Um, I'll be there as soon as I can.
###4975 - Where are you? - I'm at home. I'm on me way.
###4979 Where's Lisa?
###4981 I, uh, I... I... She went shopping. I dropped her off.
###4984 Okay. Be as quick as you can.
###5084 Yeah, you fuck.
###5088 Fuck.
###5223 I had high hopes of you, Billy.
###5227 Thought you had brains.
###5230 Not like those other animals.
###5233 I was prepared to help you.
###5238 I knew you'd make mistakes.
###5243 Then you went too far.
###5247 She belongs to me, Billy.
###5251 I don't want you to touch her!
###5285 You wanted to know where this would take you.
###5288 Billy, it ends here!
###5376 You fucker!
###5403 Lisa, it's me. They just fucking shot me. I can't believe this shit.
###5406 - Are you okay? - No, I fuckin' ain't okay!
###5409 They just tried to kill me! Why didn't you tell me about you and yke?
###5412 - What the fuck's going on? - Listen, it's a little difficult.
###5415 Little difficult? Well, I'll tell you something, Lisa.
###5417 They fucking killed Jason.
###5419 Okay. Can you drive?
###5421 did you hear what I just said? They killed Jason, Lisa.
###5424 - I fucking saw them. - I can't talk right now.
###5426 - Can you drive? - Yeah, I can drive.
###5428 - Okay. I'll meet you at number six. - Number six? The motel?
###5431 - Yeah, that's right. - You will be there?
###5433 Yeah, I'll be there.
###5435 don't fuck me up, Lisa. I need you.

###5479 - Let's get you out of this. - It fucking hurts.
###5482 It's okay. We've gotta get you cleaned up, get you in the bath.
###5491 Why didn't you tell me about you and him?
###5493 There's nothing to tell.
###5495 He's got some sort of obsession with me, that's all.
###5497 Just got out of hand.
###5500 Well, he's just tried to fucking kill me. He nearly did and all.
###5505 - He'll kill you too. - Let's deal with one problem at a time, eh?
###5508 What have you done here?
###5515 Well, we got them "E's" next door.
###5517 We can sell them two bags of pills and just get out of here.
###5520 What do you think?
###5522 I'm gonna need some antiseptic, some tweezers and a dressing. What's the time?
###5525 Look, I'm gonna find a late night chemist.
###5528 I'll take your clothes to the laundry too.
