0:0:0,475 --> 0:0:3,33
CAL ELLIOTT: Ch-ch-ch-chpfff.


3
0:0:3,33 --> 0:0:7,426
You just use the russet potatoes
for any Okies.


4
0:0:7,426 --> 0:0:9,7
I grew up in Idaho and
then I fished in


5
0:0:9,7 --> 0:0:11,33
Alaska for nine years.


6
0:0:11,33 --> 0:0:13,43
I moved to New York in '93.


7
0:0:13,43 --> 0:0:15,62
I ended up cooking.


8
0:0:15,62 --> 0:0:17,23
My cooking career
was going OK.


9
0:0:17,23 --> 0:0:19,6
And so I thought I'm ready
to start my own place.


10
0:0:19,6 --> 0:0:22,85
People said that they would back
me or help me source out,


11
0:0:22,85 --> 0:0:23,95
just get into something.


12
0:0:23,95 --> 0:0:26,13
And so I got into something.


13
0:0:26,13 --> 0:0:28,89
And the economy went to shit
and nobody showed up.


14
0:0:28,89 --> 0:0:30,64
We didn't have any money
when we opened.


15
0:0:30,64 --> 0:0:33,58
Somehow I got a loan from a
credit union in the Bronx that


16
0:0:33,58 --> 0:0:36,29
saved us in the 11th hour.


17
0:0:36,29 --> 0:0:38,495
A lot of people sat around
and watched me drown.


18
0:0:38,495 --> 0:0:40,82
And at that point I was
like, you know what?


19
0:0:40,82 --> 0:0:43,65
If I go down, I just
go down on my own.


20
0:0:43,65 --> 0:0:46,42
I'd rather just not make
any money and feel good


21
0:0:46,42 --> 0:0:47,67
about what I'm doing.


22
0:0:47,67 --> 0:0:52,18

[MUSIC PLAYING]


24
0:1:5,572 --> 0:1:7,37
CAL ELLIOTT: My name is Cal
Elliott, and I'm the Chef and


25
0:1:7,37 --> 0:1:10,44
Owner of Rye Restaurant in
Williamsburg, Brooklyn.


26
0:1:10,44 --> 0:1:13,62
Rye does simple American food.


27
0:1:13,62 --> 0:1:15,415
We try to be market-driven.


28
0:1:15,415 --> 0:1:18,87
Driven by the seasons.


29
0:1:18,87 --> 0:1:20,14
Every dish makes sense here.


30
0:1:20,14 --> 0:1:25,55
Food that you recognize, and
it makes you feel good, and


31
0:1:25,55 --> 0:1:28,5
full, and satisfied.


32
0:1:28,5 --> 0:1:30,13
I hate to say comfort
food, because


33
0:1:30,13 --> 0:1:32,4
that gets thrown around.


34
0:1:32,4 --> 0:1:34,44
And you just think mac and
cheese or something, and it's


35
0:1:34,44 --> 0:1:35,97
a lot more involved than that.


36
0:1:35,97 --> 0:1:37,86
I think we do duck really
well, but we


37
0:1:37,86 --> 0:1:38,93
always play with it.


38
0:1:38,93 --> 0:1:41,41
Like, sometimes I'll serve it
with curried lentils, with


39
0:1:41,41 --> 0:1:43,11
different marinades.


40
0:1:43,11 --> 0:1:45,25
We finish it with a little
curry butter.


41
0:1:45,25 --> 0:1:47,36
We do everything in-house,
so we try to


42
0:1:47,36 --> 0:1:49,16
take care of the product.


43
0:1:49,16 --> 0:1:51,96
The meatloaf is veal,
pork, beef.


44
0:1:51,96 --> 0:1:53,85
And then we always
have duck scraps.


45
0:1:53,85 --> 0:1:55,73
So we have all the duck tenders,
so we grind those up.


46
0:1:55,73 --> 0:1:57,85
And it basically ends up
almost like a tureen


47
0:1:57,85 --> 0:2:0,3
once you slice it.


48
0:2:0,3 --> 0:2:1,97
It offers somebody
an easy out.


49
0:2:1,97 --> 0:2:3,64
Like, you don't have a lot of
money but you're going out


50
0:2:3,64 --> 0:2:4,51
with the six type of friends.


51
0:2:4,51 --> 0:2:5,77
You're like, all right,
I'll just get


52
0:2:5,77 --> 0:2:7,2
the meatloaf sandwich.


53
0:2:7,2 --> 0:2:9,52
I'm not interested in just
cooking for rich people.


54
0:2:9,52 --> 0:2:11,87
And if someone can come and
enjoy the space that doesn't


55
0:2:11,87 --> 0:2:17,55
have the money, and enjoy a
nice meal, I'm all for it.


56
0:2:17,55 --> 0:2:21,91
We don't have the resources to
really just work on a dish for


57
0:2:21,91 --> 0:2:23,61
three months and then
be like ta da!


58
0:2:23,61 --> 0:2:24,24
Here we go.


59
0:2:24,24 --> 0:2:24,95
Here it is.


60
0:2:24,95 --> 0:2:29,36
So everything's kind of
a work in progress.


61
0:2:29,36 --> 0:2:31,19
It's assumed that I'm supposed
to have more


62
0:2:31,19 --> 0:2:32,29
thought behind things.


63
0:2:32,29 --> 0:2:34,62
But things are really just like,
oh, fuck, I've never had


64
0:2:34,62 --> 0:2:35,25
a scotch egg.


65
0:2:35,25 --> 0:2:36,485
So let's make a scotch egg.


66
0:2:36,485 --> 0:2:39,14
It was a egg wrapped in
sausage, deep-fried.


67
0:2:39,14 --> 0:2:42,7
I was like, who doesn't
want that?


68
0:2:42,7 --> 0:2:45,11
And then you make it and you're
like, oh, it's good,


69
0:2:45,11 --> 0:2:46,94
but it would be good
with this.


70
0:2:46,94 --> 0:2:48,54
And then all of a sudden
it's good with that.


71
0:2:48,54 --> 0:2:50,6
And the mornay sauce.


72
0:2:50,6 --> 0:2:52,62
Cheese on your deep-fried
scotch egg?


73
0:2:52,62 --> 0:2:54,86
Like, of course.


74
0:2:54,86 --> 0:2:56,82
And it's perfect bar food.


75
0:2:56,82 --> 0:2:58,57
I mean, I guess it's interesting
to see your food


76
0:2:58,57 --> 0:3:0,14
on a plate in the dining room.


77
0:3:0,14 --> 0:3:2,25
But when you cook it every night
on your day off, it's


78
0:3:2,25 --> 0:3:5,58
like I'm constantly eating
butter and rich food.


79
0:3:5,58 --> 0:3:9,36
And then I would just rather go
out, when I go out, and eat


80
0:3:9,36 --> 0:3:10,61
simple food.


81
0:3:10,61 --> 0:3:12,948



82
0:3:12,948 --> 0:3:13,96
It's no fair.


83
0:3:13,96 --> 0:3:16,523
You guys are ahead of me.


84
0:3:16,523 --> 0:3:18,878
CHUCK WHITE: You can catch up.


85
0:3:18,878 --> 0:3:20,3
SHEVAWN NORTON: Are you ready?


86
0:3:20,3 --> 0:3:20,665
CAL ELLIOTT: Yeah.


87
0:3:20,665 --> 0:3:22,82
Chuck and I are sick, man.


88
0:3:22,82 --> 0:3:24,91
We want some sake and
some noodles.


89
0:3:24,91 --> 0:3:28,6
We went to Samurai Mama's
on Grand Street.


90
0:3:28,6 --> 0:3:30,14
Who's the mama behind it?


91
0:3:30,14 --> 0:3:34,55



92
0:3:34,55 --> 0:3:35,74
I don't go out very often.


93
0:3:35,74 --> 0:3:39,64
But when I do, I prefer to go
out to places like Samurai


94
0:3:39,64 --> 0:3:43,7
Mama where Makoto is
another chef/owner.


95
0:3:43,7 --> 0:3:45,19
You know that you're supporting
the neighborhood.


96
0:3:45,19 --> 0:3:46,57
You're supporting someone
who's put


97
0:3:46,57 --> 0:3:48,53
their life on the line.


98
0:3:48,53 --> 0:3:50,51
In this neighborhood,
there's a restaurant


99
0:3:50,51 --> 0:3:51,86
that opens every day.


100
0:3:51,86 --> 0:3:53,21
And it's not easy.


101
0:3:53,21 --> 0:3:55,607
It makes it feel like a
community, which is why I


102
0:3:55,607 --> 0:3:57,848
opened a restaurant
where I live.


103
0:3:57,848 --> 0:3:59,35
SHEVAWN NORTON: Hi, Song.


104
0:3:59,35 --> 0:4:1,44
CAL ELLIOTT: One of our old
employees, Song, is the


105
0:4:1,44 --> 0:4:3,12
manager there now.


106
0:4:3,12 --> 0:4:4,88
She actually dates Chuck.


107
0:4:4,88 --> 0:4:7,77
It's nice to go somewhere where
you feel like people


108
0:4:7,77 --> 0:4:9,474
actually care a little
bit about you.


109
0:4:9,474 --> 0:4:10,724
Cheers.


110
0:4:10,724 --> 0:4:12,75



111
0:4:12,75 --> 0:4:14,786
SHEVAWN NORTON: I usually
come here by myself


112
0:4:14,786 --> 0:4:16,279
and sit right here.


113
0:4:16,279 --> 0:4:17,905
And nobody bothers me.


114
0:4:17,905 --> 0:4:19,409
And it's very relaxing.


115
0:4:19,409 --> 0:4:20,67
CAL ELLIOTT: They got a
good lunch special.


116
0:4:20,67 --> 0:4:23,52
We go out to lunch here
sometimes, talk business.


117
0:4:23,52 --> 0:4:25,23
MAKOTO SUZUKI: Now
we use this.


118
0:4:25,23 --> 0:4:27,953
Mm.

120
0:4:28,68 --> 0:4:29,93
Scallions!


121
0:4:29,93 --> 0:4:32,97



122
0:4:32,97 --> 0:4:35,4
This is just a deep-fried
lotus root.


123
0:4:35,4 --> 0:4:36,2
CAL ELLIOTT: All right.


124
0:4:36,2 --> 0:4:38,161
Look at that.


125
0:4:38,161 --> 0:4:40,35
Yeah, I love eating
Japanese food.


126
0:4:40,35 --> 0:4:42,36
They season dishes
differently.


127
0:4:42,36 --> 0:4:44,72
They might put something bland
with something really salty so


128
0:4:44,72 --> 0:4:47,225
you make sure that you have
to have it all together.


129
0:4:47,225 --> 0:4:50,18
MAKOTO SUZUKI: The scallop and
sea urchin are from Hokkaido.


130
0:4:50,18 --> 0:4:52,72
This is a sea urchin paste.


131
0:4:52,72 --> 0:4:55,355
This is pretty salty, so
this works as a sauce.


132
0:4:55,355 --> 0:4:56,39
You know what?


133
0:4:56,39 --> 0:4:58,68
I'm sure Cal loves this dish.


134
0:4:58,68 --> 0:5:0,975
So this is a present
from me for Cal.


135
0:5:0,975 --> 0:5:2,18
CAL ELLIOTT: All right.


136
0:5:2,18 --> 0:5:3,29
What is that thing?


137
0:5:3,29 --> 0:5:4,196
Oh, nice.


138
0:5:4,196 --> 0:5:5,585
Thank you so much.


139
0:5:5,585 --> 0:5:7,6
You see how food makes
everybody happy?


140
0:5:7,6 --> 0:5:9,56
We were all uncomfortable
before.


141
0:5:9,56 --> 0:5:11,566
Oh my god, that looks
delicious.


142
0:5:11,566 --> 0:5:12,875
I'm raw dogging the tempura.


143
0:5:12,875 --> 0:5:17,3
CHUCK WHITE: I'm going to
bareback the squash.


144
0:5:17,3 --> 0:5:18,57

love this because they give


145
0:5:18,57 --> 0:5:19,15
you a little of everything.

0:5:19,59 --> 0:5:20,11
SHEVAWN NORTON: I know.


148
0:5:20,11 --> 0:5:20,565
I love that.


149
0:5:20,565 --> 0:5:22,38
CAL ELLIOTT: That's what's great
about going somewhere


150
0:5:22,38 --> 0:5:23,14
where you know people.


151
0:5:23,14 --> 0:5:24,804
They just send stuff out.


152
0:5:24,804 --> 0:5:28,16
I really enjoy that when people
kind of leave it in


153
0:5:28,16 --> 0:5:28,63
your hands.


154
0:5:28,63 --> 0:5:30,905
Because you get to give them
dishes that you feel good


155
0:5:30,905 --> 0:5:33,12
about, with a lot of pride
and all of that.


156

Do you know what
this stuff is?


161
0:5:44,49 --> 0:5:46,62
Because this stuff
is delicious.


162
0:5:46,62 --> 0:5:48,786
I need to learn how to make
that, because that is the best


163
0:5:48,786 --> 0:5:50,45
thing in the world.


164
0:5:50,45 --> 0:5:54,51
That's seafood curry udon.

0:6:2,2 --> 0:6:4,46
I'm having such a good time.


170
0:6:4,46 --> 0:6:5,49
I am.


171
0:6:5,49 --> 0:6:7,65
I might need you to stick your
thumb up my ass so I can get


172
0:6:7,65 --> 0:6:10,69
some of this out so we can
go to the next place.


173

[LAUGHS].


174
0:6:11,94 --> 0:6:16,52



175
0:6:16,52 --> 0:6:19,3
It's funny, we've spent a lot
of time together, but the


176
0:6:19,3 --> 0:6:20,6
three of us don't--
we rarely--


177
0:6:20,6 --> 0:6:22,66
I think we've been out once,
the three of us together.


178
0:6:22,66 --> 0:6:26,61
And you need to alleviate
stress, and going out is a


179
0:6:26,61 --> 0:6:27,88
really nice thing to do.


180
0:6:27,88 --> 0:6:31,4
I wish I did it more often.


181
0:6:31,4 --> 0:6:34,22
We got very drunk
at Samurai Mama.


182
0:6:34,22 --> 0:6:35,81
We were having some warm sake.


183
0:6:35,81 --> 0:6:37,1
I'm a little under
the weather.


184
0:6:37,1 --> 0:6:40,65
Then the shots didn't really go
with anything we were doing


185
0:6:40,65 --> 0:6:43,312
other than helping us
enjoy the meal.


186
0:6:43,312 --> 0:6:44,996
CHUCK WHITE: Song,
you want a shot?


187
0:6:44,996 --> 0:6:46,626
CAL ELLIOTT: Thanks
for having us.


188
0:6:46,626 --> 0:6:49,24



189
0:6:49,24 --> 0:6:51,4
Ah, delicious.


190
0:6:51,4 --> 0:6:53,3
I guess they didn't have
proper shot glasses.


191
0:6:53,3 --> 0:6:55,35
So it was like a flute
of champagne shot.


192
0:6:55,35 --> 0:6:57,5
And we had like four
four-ounce shots.


193
0:6:57,5 --> 0:6:58,34
No one was keeping up.


194
0:6:58,34 --> 0:7:0,535
I think I was the only one that
was throwing them down by


195
0:7:0,535 --> 0:7:1,21
the end of it.


196
0:7:1,21 --> 0:7:2,53
Say hello to Lisa.


197
0:7:2,53 --> 0:7:4,8
Hello, Lisa.


198
0:7:4,8 --> 0:7:5,37
Did you just hypocrite me?


199
0:7:5,37 --> 0:7:7,932
She tried to stop me, but
I wasn't having it.


200
0:7:7,932 --> 0:7:9,51
SHEVAWN NORTON: You have
to go back and cook.


201

So just letting you--


202
0:7:10,53 --> 0:7:12,6
CAL ELLIOTT: Oh, fuck,
I have to cook.


203

The whole staff is going
to be wasted.


204

Christmas party, and then I


205

0:7:19,4 --> 0:7:20,747
Bullshit.


208
0:7:20,747 --> 0:7:21,601
Thank you, guys.


209
0:7:21,601 --> 0:7:22,8
Everything was delicious.


210
0:7:22,8 --> 0:7:23,39
MAKOTO SUZUKI: Arigato.


211
0:7:23,39 --> 0:7:24,162
Thank you.


212
0:7:24,162 --> 0:7:26,9
CAL ELLIOTT: After Samurai
Mama's we came back here so I


213
0:7:26,9 --> 0:7:32,768
could cook for everybody, which
was pretty hilarious.


214
0:7:32,768 --> 0:7:35,71
Oh, man.


215
0:7:35,71 --> 0:7:39,62
Can I just tell everybody,
we had the best


216
0:7:39,62 --> 0:7:41,43
meal at Samurai Mama's!


217
0:7:41,43 --> 0:7:41,94
-Really?


218
0:7:41,94 --> 0:7:44,35
CAL ELLIOTT: Oh my god!


219
0:7:44,35 --> 0:7:46,1
If you guys have never
had a barrel of


220
0:7:46,1 --> 0:7:48,11
cabbage, it's delicious.


221
0:7:48,11 --> 0:7:49,6
You're coming in.


222
0:7:49,6 --> 0:7:51,12
You have to come inside.


223
0:7:51,12 --> 0:7:53,148
Yeah, don't you dare
not come inside.


224
0:7:53,148 --> 0:7:55,588
Hey man, everybody's
still here.


225
0:7:55,588 --> 0:7:57,54
They're still here, yeah.


226
0:7:57,54 --> 0:8:1,444
They lay downtown roots
and they stay.


227
0:8:1,444 --> 0:8:4,372
[CHEERING]


228
0:8:4,372 --> 0:8:5,836
-The champ is here!


229
0:8:5,836 --> 0:8:6,812
CAL ELLIOTT: That's right.


230
0:8:6,812 --> 0:8:8,276
That's fucking right.


231
0:8:8,276 --> 0:8:9,28
-The champ is here!


232
0:8:9,28 --> 0:8:12,45
CAL ELLIOTT: You can't get drunk
and eat by yourself.


233
0:8:12,45 --> 0:8:15,24
Everybody's about to go home
and it's like 3 o'clock.


234
0:8:15,24 --> 0:8:17,316
And they knew you were there
until 5:00 in the morning.


235
0:8:17,316 --> 0:8:19,13
Those nights that you
don't get back,


236
0:8:19,13 --> 0:8:21,6
they're just the best.


237
0:8:21,6 --> 0:8:23,91
So if it wasn't humbling enough
to go eat beautiful


238
0:8:23,91 --> 0:8:27,29
food at Samurai Mama's, we came
back here so I could burn


239
0:8:27,29 --> 0:8:28,25
grilled cheese.


240
0:8:28,25 --> 0:8:30,12
We're going to grill
some cheese.


241
0:8:30,12 --> 0:8:32,38
Make some grilled cheese
sandwiches.


242
0:8:32,38 --> 0:8:34,83
So basically, we're going to
see how this goes, because


243
0:8:34,83 --> 0:8:37,77
we're all guinea pigs.


244
0:8:37,77 --> 0:8:39,125
This is one of those things,
like this sandwich


245
0:8:39,125 --> 0:8:41,24
has been in my head.


246
0:8:41,24 --> 0:8:44,26
I've never tried this at all.


247
0:8:44,26 --> 0:8:46,99
We have a great short rib.


248
0:8:46,99 --> 0:8:49,125
To me, this would be a delicious
grilled cheese.


249
0:8:49,125 --> 0:8:51,37
I was thinking about that
sandwich for brunch, actually.


250
0:8:51,37 --> 0:8:53,71
I mean, it's like the
most kick-ass patty


251
0:8:53,71 --> 0:8:54,91
melt you could get.


252
0:8:54,91 --> 0:8:57,22
I thought it would be easy
to make a sandwich.


253
0:8:57,22 --> 0:9:0,35
Turned out to be a little more
trying than I thought.


254
0:9:0,35 --> 0:9:1,27
I was wasted.


255
0:9:1,27 --> 0:9:4,59
And I'm like, everybody's going
to get a grilled cheese,


256
0:9:4,59 --> 0:9:6,11
which was fucking ridiculous.


257
0:9:6,11 --> 0:9:8,82
Like immediately I had
too many pans going.


258
0:9:8,82 --> 0:9:10,7
I thought I turned that off.


259
0:9:10,7 --> 0:9:12,11
I turned it up.


260
0:9:12,11 --> 0:9:14,93
That's going to be a disaster.


261
0:9:14,93 --> 0:9:17,251
-Let's see his secret
to drunk cooking.


262
0:9:17,251 --> 0:9:20,1
CAL ELLIOTT: Don't be drunk.


263
0:9:20,1 --> 0:9:24,94
So any imperfections in this
sandwich is like 100% to do


264
0:9:24,94 --> 0:9:25,735
with the cook.


265
0:9:25,735 --> 0:9:28,91
I didn't follow the steps
because I drank too much and I


266
0:9:28,91 --> 0:9:30,71
didn't give a fuck.


267
0:9:30,71 --> 0:9:32,95
And that's Cooking 101.


268
0:9:32,95 --> 0:9:36,13
Every step of the way,
you have to care.


269
0:9:36,13 --> 0:9:40,82
And one step you skip, you end
up with what we have tonight,


270
0:9:40,82 --> 0:9:42,168
which is a piece of shit.


271
0:9:42,168 --> 0:9:46,8



272
0:9:46,8 --> 0:9:47,49
MILTON CHAUCA: No,
[INAUDIBLE].


273
0:9:47,49 --> 0:9:47,92
CAL ELLIOTT: No, you.


274
0:9:47,92 --> 0:9:49,83
You, my friend, man, Milton.


275
0:9:49,83 --> 0:9:53,28
This guy, Gladys--


276
0:9:53,28 --> 0:9:55,39
Gladys and I have worked
together eight years.


277
0:9:55,39 --> 0:9:56,78
Milton and I, 12 years.


278
0:9:56,78 --> 0:9:58,64
You know how you know these
guys are awesome?


279
0:9:58,64 --> 0:10:0,14
Because they came to save me.


280
0:10:0,14 --> 0:10:2,67
They're like, I know he's going
to fuck everything up.


281
0:10:2,67 --> 0:10:4,9
And they came to save me.


282
0:10:4,9 --> 0:10:7,118
Yours is burnt.


283
0:10:7,118 --> 0:10:8,11
MILTON CHAUCA: It's OK.


284
0:10:8,11 --> 0:10:9,36
I don't care.


285
0:10:9,36 --> 0:10:13,7



286
0:10:13,7 --> 0:10:15,452
CAL ELLIOTT: It's a good
sandwich though.


287
0:10:15,452 --> 0:10:16,376
Cheers, man.


288
0:10:16,376 --> 0:10:18,23
Thank you so much.


289
0:10:18,23 --> 0:10:19,445
This guy's awesome,
by the way.


290
0:10:19,445 --> 0:10:20,183
DANNY MINCH: Aw, dude!


291
0:10:20,183 --> 0:10:21,826
We were about to kiss
right there.


292
0:10:21,826 --> 0:10:22,722
What the fuck?


293
0:10:22,722 --> 0:10:24,52
CAL ELLIOTT: Did you get that?


294
0:10:24,52 --> 0:10:25,64
DANNY MINCH: I tried to go
right and he went left.


295
0:10:25,64 --> 0:10:26,14
CAL ELLIOTT: I mouthed him.


296
0:10:26,14 --> 0:10:26,57
I mouthed him.


297
0:10:26,57 --> 0:10:28,49
DANNY MINCH: That was like
a bad pick and roll.


298
0:10:28,49 --> 0:10:29,81
What the fuck?


299
0:10:29,81 --> 0:10:31,54
CAL ELLIOTT: I'm going to talk
to Elizabeth, I talk to her.


300
0:10:31,54 --> 0:10:32,35
I don't care.


301
0:10:32,35 --> 0:10:34,54
DANNY MINCH: I don't think my
wife's going to like that.


302
0:10:34,54 --> 0:10:35,44
CAL ELLIOTT: I need
your money.


303
0:10:35,44 --> 0:10:36,43
DANNY MINCH: She's not going
to like three things.


304
0:10:36,43 --> 0:10:37,25
CAL ELLIOTT: He makes money.


305
0:10:37,25 --> 0:10:38,105
He knows how to make money.


306
0:10:38,105 --> 0:10:38,99
DANNY MINCH: Ai yi yi.


307
0:10:38,99 --> 0:10:39,9
CAL ELLIOTT: I can cook food.


308
0:10:39,9 --> 0:10:41,15
He knows how to make money.


309
0:10:41,15 --> 0:12:41,15
