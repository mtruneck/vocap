1
0:0:36,4 --> 0:1:6,92
Fuck...


2
0:1:6,92 --> 0:1:8,72
Fuckin' hell!


3
0:1:8,72 --> 0:1:11,32
What's the matter with you? What?


4
0:1:11,32 --> 0:1:15,2
- I'm not a bloody prostitute!
- All right, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.


5
0:1:15,2 --> 0:1:17,48
Christ's sake, this was our second date!


6
0:1:17,48 --> 0:1:20,4
Was it? Listen, listen, all right...


7
0:1:20,4 --> 0:1:23,68
I was on the tequilas
last night and, um...


8
0:1:23,68 --> 0:1:27,24
- What is your name again?
- You're kidding.


9
0:1:27,24 --> 0:1:29,96
Tell you what, if you was a prostitute...


10
0:1:29,96 --> 0:1:38,44
you know... you'd be caked.


11
0:1:38,44 --> 0:1:41,32
What's the matter with you?
That was a compliment!


12
0:1:41,32 --> 0:1:46,84
You know what I mean, I can't win!
I've got the pox of it.


13
0:1:46,84 --> 0:1:51,0
Tell you something else,
you're only an old dog, anyway.


14
0:1:51,0 --> 0:1:54,4
Maybe "boys' weekend,"
wasn't the best choice of words.


15
0:1:54,4 --> 0:1:55,8
Whatever. Have a nice time.


16
0:1:55,8 --> 0:1:59,64
I'm not one of those guys
who ditches his mates for his girlfriend!


17
0:1:59,64 --> 0:2:2,56
- I don't want you to ditch your mates!
- What DO you want?


18
0:2:2,56 --> 0:2:7,64
An invite would've been nice.


19
0:2:7,64 --> 0:2:14,84
No girls allowed, darling.


20
0:2:14,84 --> 0:2:17,24
I didn't know
there was gonna be strippers!


21
0:2:17,24 --> 0:2:20,92
- And Neil's not in charge. I am.
- That fills me with confidence.


22
0:2:20,92 --> 0:2:23,72
I'm only going to my gran's.
I'll be back on Monday.


23
0:2:23,72 --> 0:2:30,76
I'll have the locks changed before then.


24
0:2:30,76 --> 0:2:34,36
Bex, Bex...
It's for Vince. Vince!


25
0:2:34,36 --> 0:2:37,16
He's helped me
out so many times, I've lost count.


26
0:2:37,16 --> 0:2:40,36
When I first came to London,
he supported me. I owe him.


27
0:2:40,36 --> 0:2:43,72
Lots of people get divorced, Mikey.
He'll get over it.


28
0:2:43,72 --> 0:2:47,4
Yes, by spending a weekend
getting trollied with his mates.


29
0:2:47,4 --> 0:2:50,56
Well, you can celebrate
your own divorce with him!


30
0:2:50,56 --> 0:2:53,88
I thought you'd react like that,
so I glued your ring on.


31
0:2:53,88 --> 0:3:1,48
- See you Monday, babe. Love you too!
- Mikey, if you walk out that gate...


32
0:3:1,48 --> 0:3:6,36
You don't know whether
you're coming or going, do you?


33
0:3:6,36 --> 0:3:10,48
Patrick!


34
0:3:10,48 --> 0:3:12,16
I'm going. I'm going!


35
0:3:12,16 --> 0:3:14,6
The first weekend
my parents visit in years,


36
0:3:14,6 --> 0:3:18,2
and you bugger off to the wilderness
to rediscover your testicles!


37
0:3:18,2 --> 0:3:21,48
It's bad enough I have to tell them
you've quit your job...


38
0:3:21,48 --> 0:3:24,28
<i>Welcome to Sonic Stress Therapy.</i>


39
0:3:24,28 --> 0:3:29,24
<i>It's going to be a beautiful day.
Let's start it with a smile.</i>


40
0:3:29,24 --> 0:3:56,96
<i>- Anxiety is almost the same...
- Are you just gonna fucking go?</i>


41
0:3:56,96 --> 0:3:59,12
<i>No, no.</i>


42
0:3:59,12 --> 0:4:5,4
It's a symbol of his identity, and the
source of his primeval inner strength.


43
0:4:5,4 --> 0:4:8,2
So how come the Zombie Girls
kick his arse on page 4?


44
0:4:8,2 --> 0:4:11,16
How many times have I told you
they're NOT zombies?!


45
0:4:11,16 --> 0:4:16,6
- All right, calm down. It's only a comic.
- No, no, it's not only a comic.


46
0:4:16,6 --> 0:4:21,2
This is a... It's a unique
and often misunderstood art form.


47
0:4:21,2 --> 0:4:24,76
This... is a painstakingly crafted,


48
0:4:24,76 --> 0:4:29,32
and carefully balanced alignment
of words and art, OK?


49
0:4:29,32 --> 0:4:32,52
- What, like TV?
- Do you want it or not?


50
0:4:32,52 --> 0:4:36,0
- No, it's stupid.
- Right, piss off!


51
0:4:36,0 --> 0:4:39,8
- Go on. We're closing early, OK?
- What? Why?


52
0:4:39,8 --> 0:4:42,84
<i>Spaceltime anomaly.</i>


53
0:4:42,84 --> 0:4:46,2
You mean... you want
a bit of time alone with your missus.


54
0:4:46,2 --> 0:4:49,56
Don't touch her. Get off her and get out!


55
0:4:49,56 --> 0:4:51,16
Go on, then!


56
0:4:51,16 --> 0:4:55,8
Go on, out!
And don't come back!


57
0:4:55,8 --> 0:5:5,36
Little knob-end.


58
0:5:5,36 --> 0:5:7,64
Vince, you're not getting out of this!


59
0:5:7,64 --> 0:5:16,8
- You're coming with us!
- We're gonna have such a good time!


60
0:5:16,8 --> 0:5:26,68
Be careful! Be careful! Be careful!


61
0:5:26,68 --> 0:5:31,8
Oh, you bastard!


62
0:5:31,8 --> 0:5:36,44
Bastard!


63
0:5:36,44 --> 0:5:39,72
Bastard!


64
0:5:39,72 --> 0:5:44,32
Bastard!


65
0:5:44,32 --> 0:6:10,4
Bastard!


66
0:6:10,4 --> 0:6:25,16
(THE HORRORS' She Is The New Thing)


67
0:6:25,16 --> 0:6:27,68
<i># She's a special girl, you know</i>


68
0:6:27,68 --> 0:6:31,64
<i># The kind I'd hope to see
Hanging on a wall</i>


69
0:6:31,64 --> 0:6:40,48
<i># Watching me cross the street</i>


70
0:6:40,48 --> 0:6:43,8
<i># I wonder how long it will be</i>


71
0:6:43,8 --> 0:6:47,8

0:6:47,8 --> 0:6:48,84
<i># Where she goes or has been</i>


73
0:6:48,84 --> 0:6:50,72
<i># Cause she's the new thing</i>

0:6:50,72 --> 0:6:52,68
<i># Cause she's the new thing</i>


75
0:6:52,68 --> 0:6:54,52
<i># She is the new thing</i>


76
0:6:54,52 --> 0:7:2,2

<i># She is the new thing</i>

<i># Always a new thing</i>


83
0:7:15,92 --> 0:7:22,32
<i># Staring at her, ulterior girl</i>


84
0:7:22,32 --> 0:7:23,96
Thanks.


85
0:7:23,96 --> 0:7:26,84
- Vince, you left this behind, mate.
- Ta.


86
0:7:26,84 --> 0:7:29,72
- I thought you'd given up.
- I have.


87
0:7:29,72 --> 0:7:32,32
- Where's Banksy?
- Late.


88
0:7:32,32 --> 0:7:34,72
He's always late for everything.


89
0:7:34,72 --> 0:7:39,48
He showed up on time for his wedding.


90
0:7:39,48 --> 0:7:41,2
Why's that funny?


91
0:7:41,2 --> 0:7:45,68
Well, he showed up, and...
she didn't show up at all.


92
0:7:45,68 --> 0:7:48,2
Lucky bastard!


93
0:7:48,2 --> 0:8:11,48
Here, I'll give him call.


94
0:8:11,48 --> 0:8:19,36
Oh, shit!


95
0:8:19,36 --> 0:8:22,0
<i>... you're through to Banksy Electrical.</i>


96
0:8:22,0 --> 0:8:27,2
<i>Please leave your name and number
after the tone, and I'll...</i>


97
0:8:27,2 --> 0:8:29,2
Banksy, you're wanker.


98
0:8:29,2 --> 0:8:31,0
Hurry up!


99
0:8:31,0 --> 0:8:34,76
Liven yourself up, lazy-bollocks!


100
0:8:34,76 --> 0:8:37,36
Hey, Pat, what's with
them golf clubs, man?


101
0:8:37,36 --> 0:8:40,2
There's no golf courses
where we're going.


102
0:8:40,2 --> 0:8:43,68
That's why have this bag...
my little friend.


103
0:8:43,68 --> 0:8:45,84
You know there's more
to life than football.


104
0:8:45,84 --> 0:8:49,44
- All you need is the open air...
- Me nuts!


105
0:8:49,44 --> 0:8:53,16
I don't think your new-age
golf therapy is gonna work on Vince, Pat.


106
0:8:53,16 --> 0:8:55,36
Vince is real man, Pat, not like you.


107
0:8:55,36 --> 0:8:58,8
You should've seen him
in his glory days, Mikey.


108
0:8:58,8 --> 0:9:1,92
I mean, they used to call him Fearless.


109
0:9:1,92 --> 0:9:6,52
He would step out in front of
a raging bull just to protect his mates,


110
0:9:6,52 --> 0:9:10,4
and still manage to buy the first round
from his hospital bed.


111
0:9:10,4 --> 0:9:14,56
Yeah, that's only 'cause you guys
picked up what was left in me wallet.


112
0:9:14,56 --> 0:9:17,4
- We helped you.
- Go on, show Mikey.


113
0:9:17,4 --> 0:9:21,96
- Oh, yeah, look at this!
- Let's have a look.


114
0:9:21,96 --> 0:9:26,96
Pamplona Bull Run '96. He screamed
like a girl the whole way around.


115
0:9:26,96 --> 0:9:29,12
I wish I was there, man...


116
0:9:29,12 --> 0:9:32,48
Shit!


117
0:9:32,48 --> 0:9:35,28
Sorry, mate, seriously.
Let me just...


118
0:9:35,28 --> 0:9:57,12
Anyway, where were we?


119
0:9:57,12 --> 0:9:58,88
Snap out of it, Vince.


120
0:9:58,88 --> 0:10:2,52
Today you re-discover your inner bloke.
You don't wanna miss it.


121
0:10:2,52 --> 0:10:4,68
Me inner bloke's all right, thanks.


122
0:10:4,68 --> 0:10:8,6
He's not, though, is he?
He's lost his way.


123
0:10:8,6 --> 0:10:13,16
We all have.
All suffering from social gender anxiety.


124
0:10:13,16 --> 0:10:15,28
Is that some sort of disease
or something?


125
0:10:15,28 --> 0:10:17,32
Nobody knows, that's the problem.


126
0:10:17,32 --> 0:10:21,64
The second you try
to figure it out... doomed.


127
0:10:21,64 --> 0:10:28,32
Not you, Vince. We're gonna
bring you back from the brink.


128
0:10:28,32 --> 0:10:32,68
- Oi, no smoking!
- Shut up.


129
0:10:32,68 --> 0:10:36,12
- You're outnumbered.
- I'm terrified!


130
0:10:36,12 --> 0:10:38,4
Slag.


131
0:10:38,4 --> 0:10:40,48
- Charmer...
- Wha'? Wha'?


132
0:10:40,48 --> 0:10:44,24
- Now, listen to me, boys...
- I thought it was funny.


133
0:10:44,24 --> 0:10:46,4
This is the plan.


134
0:10:46,4 --> 0:10:50,76
First thing we do in the country,
we piss up the trees, mark our territory.


135
0:10:50,76 --> 0:10:54,68
Then we're gonna find a pub and drink
till we've forgotten how to speak.


136
0:10:54,68 --> 0:10:59,44
We'll communicate in grunts like
cavemen, until we pass out in the woods.


137
0:10:59,44 --> 0:11:1,72
Any questions?


138
0:11:1,72 --> 0:11:8,8
- Are you Michael? I'm the driver.
- Hey, she's the driver!


139
0:11:8,8 --> 0:11:14,48
Wanna see my driver's license?


140
0:11:14,48 --> 0:11:18,32
That's Mikey,
the little squirt sitting there.


141
0:11:18,32 --> 0:11:21,6
I'm Neil. What's your name, babe?


142
0:11:21,6 --> 0:11:24,2
I can tell you now it's not "babe".


143
0:11:24,2 --> 0:11:26,84
It's gonna be a long drive, isn't it?


144
0:11:26,84 --> 0:11:30,44
Looks like it's heading that way,
don't it?


145
0:11:30,44 --> 0:11:33,12
I tell you what, let's start again.


146
0:11:33,12 --> 0:11:37,16
- My name's Neil.
- My name's Ruth.


147
0:11:37,16 --> 0:11:39,72
From now on it's Candy.


148
0:11:39,72 --> 0:11:44,92
Ignore him, RUTH. He's a throwback.
He hasn't evolved properly.


149
0:11:44,92 --> 0:11:52,56
Call me Candy.


150
0:11:52,56 --> 0:12:4,36
Come on!


151
0:12:4,36 --> 0:12:7,16
- Right, boys, you ready?
- Yeah!


152
0:12:7,16 --> 0:12:10,88
Get on these 2 here, look.
A couple of right wrong 'uns.


153
0:12:10,88 --> 0:12:14,16
I'll tell you what, women love me.


154
0:12:14,16 --> 0:12:19,12
You got enough petrol, babe,
and all that, yeah?


155
0:12:19,12 --> 0:12:22,32
- Have you called Banksy again?
- He'll show up.


156
0:12:22,32 --> 0:12:33,16
He's like Mikey's missus.
You can't shake him off.


157
0:12:33,16 --> 0:12:35,64
It looks nice, but it's a piece of shit.


158
0:12:35,64 --> 0:12:37,6
- What?
- It's fucked.


159
0:12:37,6 --> 0:12:39,56
But I've only had it 5 minutes.


160
0:12:39,56 --> 0:12:50,76
Someone's run the knackers off it.
You can't fix that with a nice paint job.


161
0:12:50,76 --> 0:12:53,56
You're the one
who's getting divorced, ain't you?


162
0:12:53,56 --> 0:12:55,36
Thanks for bringing it up.


163
0:12:55,36 --> 0:12:58,28
There's worse things
than getting divorced.


164
0:12:58,28 --> 0:13:1,28
Rape, murder, castration.


165
0:13:1,28 --> 0:13:3,8
Fair enough.


166
0:13:3,8 --> 0:13:7,52
What's in a weird village like Moodley
that you can't find in London?


167
0:13:7,52 --> 0:13:11,2
Mikey's nan lives there.
We'll stay there while she's away.


168
0:13:11,2 --> 0:13:13,4
What do you mean weird?


169
0:13:13,4 --> 0:13:15,72
Well, it's just a dead-end
in the middle of the woods.


170
0:13:15,72 --> 0:13:18,76
There's nothing there.


171
0:13:18,76 --> 0:13:21,24
When I saw the booking
I thought it was a wind-up.


172
0:13:21,24 --> 0:13:24,8
Mikey says the women
outnumber the men 4 to 1.


173
0:13:24,8 --> 0:13:26,44
Yes, they do, Neil.


174
0:13:26,44 --> 0:13:29,48
- And obviously they're all gagging for it.
- Obviously.


175
0:13:29,48 --> 0:13:31,84
An entire village
full of man-hungry women


176
0:13:31,84 --> 0:13:35,12
waiting to jump the first band
of desperados rolling up from London.


177
0:13:35,12 --> 0:13:37,44
Have you been there, then?


178
0:13:37,44 --> 0:13:41,0
My firm hasn't booked
a job to Moodley in years.


179
0:13:41,0 --> 0:13:44,28
Oh, sod off.


180
0:13:44,28 --> 0:13:47,84
<i>Don't fear. There's no cause for alarm.</i>


181
0:13:47,84 --> 0:13:50,2
All is well.


182
0:13:50,2 --> 0:13:53,16
Death is a natural part of life.


183
0:13:53,16 --> 0:13:57,16
Anxiety about this
is an inbuilt survival reflex,


184
0:13:57,16 --> 0:14:15,68
no longer required in this beautiful
predator-free world.


185
0:14:15,68 --> 0:14:27,24
Welcome to the country.


186
0:14:27,24 --> 0:14:32,72
I'll do it, then, shall I?


187
0:14:32,72 --> 0:14:39,72
Yeah, well done.


188
0:14:39,72 --> 0:14:42,76
What's your nana up to
this weekend, Mikey?


189
0:14:42,76 --> 0:14:45,32
She's off on a cruise
while the builders are in.


190
0:14:45,32 --> 0:14:47,44
What builders?


191
0:14:47,44 --> 0:14:50,52
Oh, they'll be gone by the time
we come out of the pub.


192
0:14:50,52 --> 0:14:53,56
What about when they're back
at dawn and start drilling holes?


193
0:14:53,56 --> 0:14:56,52
- She doesn't know we're coming.
- Well... I did say...


194
0:14:56,52 --> 0:15:1,0
- You fuckin' idiot.
- Listen, man, I know where the key is!


195
0:15:1,0 --> 0:15:3,32
Jesus! This gets better and better.


196
0:15:3,32 --> 0:15:6,72
I might just stay on the minibus
and wait for the return trip.


197
0:15:6,72 --> 0:15:14,32
Gentlemen, you are all past
the point of no return.


198
0:15:14,32 --> 0:15:16,72
Oh, for fuck's sake, Mikey.


199
0:15:16,72 --> 0:15:21,28
It's not me. It's not me!


200
0:15:21,28 --> 0:15:23,72
Hello? Yeah...


201
0:15:23,72 --> 0:15:26,24
I told you I'd sign the papers.


202
0:15:26,24 --> 0:15:28,48
Solicitors always say that.


203
0:15:28,48 --> 0:15:32,44
I can't do nothing today.
I'm not in London.


204
0:15:32,44 --> 0:15:35,4
Moodley... Moodley!


205
0:15:35,4 --> 0:15:39,56
What do you mean it's a shit hole?


206
0:15:39,56 --> 0:15:47,3
Hello? Hello?


207
0:15:47,3 --> 0:15:49,2
Not my PS...


208
0:15:49,2 --> 0:15:53,2
That's it. Give us that fucking thing.
I've had enough of this!


209
0:15:53,2 --> 0:15:57,4
- I'm not having this.
- What are you gonna do?


210
0:15:57,4 --> 0:16:1,24
- All the phones, off, in this bag.
- What?!


211
0:16:1,24 --> 0:16:4,4
- OK? All of you. Come on!
- No, no, no.


212
0:16:4,4 --> 0:16:7,72
Getting away from it all doesn't include
spousal abuse by T-Mobile.


213
0:16:7,72 --> 0:16:10,88
- See you, darling.
- I need to ring my mum.


214
0:16:10,88 --> 0:16:18,52
- You've got mine already.
- In the bag, sunshine.


215
0:16:18,52 --> 0:16:21,68
- Ladies first.
- After you, then.


216
0:16:21,68 --> 0:16:53,2
All right.


217
0:16:53,2 --> 0:16:55,52
Mikey?! Is this it?


218
0:16:55,52 --> 0:16:59,68
- Please tell me you took a wrong turn.
- Told you the place was a dead end.


219
0:16:59,68 --> 0:17:2,4
Is that it? Is this?


220
0:17:2,4 --> 0:17:12,76
Mikey!


221
0:17:12,76 --> 0:17:15,2
We're in the middle of fuckin' nowhere.


222
0:17:15,2 --> 0:17:19,56
I'd leave all that, Mikey,
till we've done a bit of reconnaissance.


223
0:17:19,56 --> 0:17:24,32
- We might not be staying.
- What do you mean not staying?


224
0:17:24,32 --> 0:17:27,56
I'm off the clock for half an hour,
then I'm leaving...


225
0:17:27,56 --> 0:17:32,68
with or without you.


226
0:17:32,68 --> 0:17:43,92
Fiddlesticks!


227
0:17:43,92 --> 0:17:47,36
On your head!


228
0:17:47,36 --> 0:17:59,28
- What the fuck are you doing?
- You idiot!


229
0:17:59,28 --> 0:18:5,36
I'm sure this place used to be bigger
when I was, err... little.


230
0:18:5,36 --> 0:18:8,6
Looks like the whole village
has fucked off with your nan.


231
0:18:8,6 --> 0:18:10,76
Where's all the women, then?


232
0:18:10,76 --> 0:18:13,16
When were you last here, Mikey?


233
0:18:13,16 --> 0:18:18,0
- Well, it's been a few years.
- Right, come on. First things first.


234
0:18:18,0 --> 0:18:22,68
Mikey, you break into your nan's house
and make sure I've got a bed for tonight.


235
0:18:22,68 --> 0:18:25,92
The rest of us can get the beers in
at the... Cock & Bull,


236
0:18:25,92 --> 0:18:28,68
and drink until Moodley
starts looking like Barbados.


237
0:18:28,68 --> 0:18:30,84
And someone
go get Candy down for a drink.


238
0:18:30,84 --> 0:18:32,68
I'll go.


239
0:18:32,68 --> 0:18:36,48
Neil, if she sees you,
she's liable to drive away with our stuff.


240
0:18:36,48 --> 0:18:39,96
What are you talking about?
Women love me.


241
0:18:39,96 --> 0:18:41,48
Really?


242
0:18:41,48 --> 0:18:53,8
You are a long way from
your sports car, though, aren't you?


243
0:18:53,8 --> 0:18:56,8
I'm gonna go for a slash.
Get us a pint of the usual.


244
0:18:56,8 --> 0:18:59,12
Oh, no, put your money away, Neil.
My shout!


245
0:18:59,12 --> 0:19:28,4
Knob.


246
0:19:28,4 --> 0:19:30,2
"Vote Meg Nut".


247
0:19:30,2 --> 0:19:33,96
Meg Nut... Nut-meg...


248
0:19:33,96 --> 0:20:3,44
"Sponsored by Wundawash. "


249
0:20:3,44 --> 0:20:31,24
Oh, shit.


250
0:20:31,24 --> 0:20:34,52
Yes! Yes, yes.


251
0:20:34,52 --> 0:20:45,36
Oh, thank you, gnomie.


252
0:20:45,36 --> 0:20:46,96
Hello?


253
0:20:46,96 --> 0:20:50,32
I can't believe we jumped
on one of Mikey's schemes.


254
0:20:50,32 --> 0:20:54,24
- His heart's in the right place.
- Shame his head is up his arse.


255
0:20:54,24 --> 0:20:57,4
Come on, Pat.
Liven yourself up. Get 'em in.


256
0:20:57,4 --> 0:20:59,92
Neil, Do you see any bar staff?


257
0:20:59,92 --> 0:21:2,76
I think I just saw one in the khazi,
chucking up.


258
0:21:2,76 --> 0:21:7,48
- Maybe they're all sick.
- What the fuck is that horrible stench?


259
0:21:7,48 --> 0:21:10,72
It's the smoking ban, mate.
Get rid of the all the puffers,


260
0:21:10,72 --> 0:21:14,56
you'll find out what a pub really
smells like - stale beer and piss.


261
0:21:14,56 --> 0:21:19,76
No. It's something else.


262
0:21:19,76 --> 0:21:36,92
Where the fuck's Matt?


263
0:21:36,92 --> 0:21:39,36
All right, calm down.
You sound like a dolphin.


264
0:21:39,36 --> 0:21:41,24
Idiot.


265
0:21:41,24 --> 0:21:44,48
Look at that.


266
0:21:44,48 --> 0:22:2,64
It's a knob in a box.


267
0:22:2,64 --> 0:22:10,52
This is a joke, right?


268
0:22:10,52 --> 0:22:13,44
Don't...


269
0:22:13,44 --> 0:22:15,8
Hey, back up. Back up.


270
0:22:15,8 --> 0:22:21,36
I will...


271
0:22:21,36 --> 0:22:28,28
Looks like there is
life on Mars, after all.


272
0:22:28,28 --> 0:22:31,32
- What's the matter with her?
- I think she's homeless.


273
0:22:31,32 --> 0:22:35,92
300 miles from London, the only
person we see is selling the Big Issue.


274
0:22:35,92 --> 0:22:42,6
- Let's get some change.
- I've got some, I've got some.


275
0:22:42,6 --> 0:22:53,44
Hey! Hey!


276
0:22:53,44 --> 0:22:58,56
Go Vince!


277
0:22:58,56 --> 0:23:1,96
- It's not what it looks like, mate!
- Yeah?


278
0:23:1,96 --> 0:23:8,0
Matt, call the police!


279
0:23:8,0 --> 0:23:15,88
Go, Graham. Hit him!


280
0:23:15,88 --> 0:23:21,4
Go on! Somebody else hit him!


281
0:23:21,4 --> 0:23:23,92
Put the knife down, mate.


282
0:23:23,92 --> 0:23:30,4
Put the knife down!


283
0:23:30,4 --> 0:23:38,12
You lot, just listen to me!


284
0:23:38,12 --> 0:23:40,16
- Hey, watch!
- She stabbed me!


285
0:23:40,16 --> 0:23:42,84
All right, hey, hey!


286
0:23:42,84 --> 0:23:46,84
- Oi! Oi!
- What are you doing?!


287
0:23:46,84 --> 0:23:52,0
- Can we talk about this?
- Hang on, hang on.


288
0:23:52,0 --> 0:24:1,16
Jesus...


289
0:24:1,16 --> 0:24:4,36
- What... What's wrong with her?
- What do you mean?


290
0:24:4,36 --> 0:24:9,72
She's like Evil Dead in your shop,
those things with the claws and teeth!


291
0:24:9,72 --> 0:24:16,88
And she's not the only one.


292
0:24:16,88 --> 0:24:25,44
Look! Look at that. Look, look.


293
0:24:25,44 --> 0:24:28,88
- Back on the bus, then, eh?
- Yes, yes!


294
0:24:28,88 --> 0:24:31,44
- What about Action Man?
- Oh, shit.


295
0:24:31,44 --> 0:24:41,68
Come on! Leave him!


296
0:24:41,68 --> 0:24:49,64
Candy, start her up, baby.
We're leaving.


297
0:24:49,64 --> 0:24:53,96
Let's go somewhere else, then.


298
0:24:53,96 --> 0:24:56,8
Yeah, OK.


299
0:24:56,8 --> 0:25:0,48
Where's your nan's house, Mike?


300
0:25:0,48 --> 0:25:7,8
Mike, your nan's house!


301
0:25:7,8 --> 0:25:11,64
OK...


302
0:25:11,64 --> 0:25:37,92
Let's take the scenic route.


303
0:25:37,92 --> 0:25:44,2
Mikey... Get his gun.


304
0:25:44,2 --> 0:26:2,24
YOU get it.


305
0:26:2,24 --> 0:26:4,8
It's empty.


306
0:26:4,8 --> 0:26:6,6
Oh, mate...


307
0:26:6,6 --> 0:26:8,64
That is not cool...


308
0:26:8,64 --> 0:26:16,6
Look at the state of him.


309
0:26:16,6 --> 0:26:19,48
What?


310
0:26:19,48 --> 0:26:21,56
He said, "Don't go in the woods. "


311
0:26:21,56 --> 0:26:28,48
- Why?
- Why you asking me?


312
0:26:28,48 --> 0:26:30,84
What's in the woods?


313
0:26:30,84 --> 0:26:40,84
Everything... you've ever been afraid of.


314
0:26:40,84 --> 0:26:45,4
Oh, shit! Oh, shit!


315
0:26:45,4 --> 0:26:47,64
Quick, quick, Graham!


316
0:26:47,64 --> 0:26:50,76
- Open the fucking door!
- I'm gonna do it when I get the key!


317
0:26:50,76 --> 0:27:0,52
These are multi-combat trousers!
They've got 11 pockets!


318
0:27:0,52 --> 0:27:4,8
You missed her!


319
0:27:4,8 --> 0:27:15,0
Open the fucking door!


320
0:27:15,0 --> 0:27:16,6
- Vince!
- What?


321
0:27:16,6 --> 0:27:21,88
Help me!


322
0:27:21,88 --> 0:27:31,56
- I've got the key!
- OPEN IT, THEN!


323
0:27:31,56 --> 0:27:41,6
Shut the back door!


324
0:27:41,6 --> 0:27:43,16
Oi, oi!


325
0:27:43,16 --> 0:27:50,2
They're moving away!


326
0:27:50,2 --> 0:28:7,64
All right, you funny cunts,
how's this supposed to cheer me up?


327
0:28:7,64 --> 0:28:10,92
- Phones are dead.
- "Let's put all the mobiles in a bag. "


328
0:28:10,92 --> 0:28:14,8
- Good idea, Neil!
- You wanna talk about this some more?


329
0:28:14,8 --> 0:28:17,84
Let's talk about the unliveable state
of this house we're staying in.


330
0:28:17,84 --> 0:28:20,44
OK, back door's locked, kettle is on.


331
0:28:20,44 --> 0:28:26,4
Neil.


332
0:28:26,4 --> 0:28:31,24
- They're not coming back.
- So what's going on here?


333
0:28:31,24 --> 0:28:34,4
It could be some kind of
chemical spillage.


334
0:28:34,4 --> 0:28:37,0
Maybe one of the streams
has been polluted.


335
0:28:37,0 --> 0:28:39,2
Patrick, when was the last time


336
0:28:39,2 --> 0:28:44,52
you saw pollution turn somebody
into an axe murderer?


337
0:28:44,52 --> 0:28:49,28
Candy didn't even get off the bus
and she still turned into that.


338
0:28:49,28 --> 0:28:52,96
- So it must be in the air.
- Why haven't we got it? And him?


339
0:28:52,96 --> 0:28:58,36
- Maybe only women get it.
- What kind of virus only affects women?


340
0:28:58,36 --> 0:29:3,12
Bird flu.


341
0:29:3,12 --> 0:29:10,4
So where did all the men go?


342
0:29:10,4 --> 0:29:14,8
No, no, no!


343
0:29:14,8 --> 0:29:23,32
What is it?


344
0:29:23,32 --> 0:29:26,0
Are you fucking retarded?


345
0:29:26,0 --> 0:29:28,32
All the men are dead.


346
0:29:28,32 --> 0:29:32,8
- Sit down, Andy McNabb.
- Easy, mate. I'm not the enemy.


347
0:29:32,8 --> 0:29:34,64
- Really? See, I think you are.
- Right...


348
0:29:34,64 --> 0:29:38,16
We demand an explanation!


349
0:29:38,16 --> 0:29:40,76
Is it a biological weapon
gone out of control?


350
0:29:40,76 --> 0:29:42,6
It's classified is what it is.


351
0:29:42,6 --> 0:29:45,48
It's hardly classified, mate,
it's running about in stilettos!


352
0:29:45,48 --> 0:29:50,96
- I said sit down.
- Or what? Or what?


353
0:29:50,96 --> 0:29:55,36
Oi! Oi! Oi!


354
0:29:55,36 --> 0:30:5,72
Kettle's boiled.


355
0:30:5,72 --> 0:30:8,4
- What's your name?
- Sergeant Gavin Wright.


356
0:30:8,4 --> 0:30:12,4
We don't give fuck about your rank.
We want an explanation.


357
0:30:12,4 --> 0:30:14,68
- It's virus.
- Why aren't we infected?


358
0:30:14,68 --> 0:30:17,76
I thought you'd worked this one out.
Only women get it.


359
0:30:17,76 --> 0:30:20,4
- Why?
- Just luck.


360
0:30:20,4 --> 0:30:22,92
Oh, that's not funny. Is there a cure?


361
0:30:22,92 --> 0:30:25,72
I don't think anybody
survived long enough to try.


362
0:30:25,72 --> 0:30:30,16
But that's not my department.
I'm just here to shoot them.


363
0:30:30,16 --> 0:30:32,12
- What?
- How did it start?


364
0:30:32,12 --> 0:30:34,48
The only questions you need to ask are,


365
0:30:34,48 --> 0:30:37,24
"How many are there?"
and, "Are they in our way?"


366
0:30:37,24 --> 0:30:39,0
So, how many are there?


367
0:30:39,0 --> 0:30:41,44
The whole village
has gone over to the dark side.


368
0:30:41,44 --> 0:30:43,92
Most of them are out in the woods.


369
0:30:43,92 --> 0:30:47,2
So if you're thinking
of hiking out of here, think again.


370
0:30:47,2 --> 0:30:49,76
What the fuck are they doing
in the woods?


371
0:30:49,76 --> 0:30:54,12
Maybe they're all taking a shit.
Women like to go to the toilet together.


372
0:30:54,12 --> 0:30:58,72
What do you think they're doing?
They're looking for fresh meat.


373
0:30:58,72 --> 0:31:1,2
- So what's your exit plan?
- Same as yours.


374
0:31:1,2 --> 0:31:4,56
Get on the minibus
and fuck off out the way you came in.


375
0:31:4,56 --> 0:31:7,4
Well, there's little problem
with your plan, Marvin.


376
0:31:7,4 --> 0:31:25,56
Bad Candy lives on that bus.
And she's got a little skin complaint.


377
0:31:25,56 --> 0:31:30,28
When she gets off the bus, start running
and don't stop until you hear the horn.


378
0:31:30,28 --> 0:31:32,32
We'll come back and pick you up.


379
0:31:32,32 --> 0:31:35,16
Why are you so sure
she's gonna follow me?


380
0:31:35,16 --> 0:31:38,56
Women love you.


381
0:31:38,56 --> 0:31:43,76
If you have to kill her, just do it.
She's not Candy anymore.


382
0:31:43,76 --> 0:31:46,6
She never was. Her name's Ruth.


383
0:31:46,6 --> 0:31:48,96
- Whatever.
- Well, stop calling her Candy.


384
0:31:48,96 --> 0:31:52,0
Neil, now is not the time
to stop objectifying women.


385
0:31:52,0 --> 0:31:53,84
Be new man tomorrow.


386
0:31:53,84 --> 0:31:58,84
Today, we need you to be the misogynist
Neanderthal arsehole we know and love.


387
0:31:58,84 --> 0:32:2,44
- You could get this virus next...
- Fuck off.


388
0:32:2,44 --> 0:32:5,2
You even hit like a girl.


389
0:32:5,2 --> 0:32:7,2
- What are you doing?
- Fucking go.


390
0:32:7,2 --> 0:32:9,4
- Liberty-taker.
- Hurry up!


391
0:32:9,4 --> 0:32:25,64
All right, I'm going.


392
0:32:25,64 --> 0:32:28,28
Come on... Come and have a nibble.


393
0:32:28,28 --> 0:32:32,16
You know you want it.


394
0:32:32,16 --> 0:32:46,6
Bollocks.


395
0:32:46,6 --> 0:32:48,28
Get off the...


396
0:32:48,28 --> 0:33:1,56
- Go! Go!
- Quick, hurry up!


397
0:33:1,56 --> 0:33:3,64
Get the phones!


398
0:33:3,64 --> 0:33:13,32
Someone get the phones!


399
0:33:13,32 --> 0:33:30,42
Bastards!


400
0:33:30,42 --> 0:34:0,24
Fuckin' hell!


401
0:34:0,24 --> 0:34:5,4
Oh, man. We are dog meat.


402
0:34:5,4 --> 0:34:7,76
They're everywhere!


403
0:34:7,76 --> 0:34:12,44
- Shit...
- Oh, man!


404
0:34:12,44 --> 0:34:14,4
Julie?


405
0:34:14,4 --> 0:34:18,4
Do you know her?


406
0:34:18,4 --> 0:34:23,28
Yeah, yeah...
We had thing once, it didn't end well.


407
0:34:23,28 --> 0:34:29,76
- I'm gonna be sick.
- How do you think I feel?!


408
0:34:29,76 --> 0:34:33,16
The phones...
I've got the fucking phones!


409
0:34:33,16 --> 0:34:36,0
Shit...


410
0:34:36,0 --> 0:34:41,56
- Do something! You're the soldier!
- Look at the fucking size of her!


411
0:34:41,56 --> 0:34:45,48
Oh, no...


412
0:34:45,48 --> 0:34:52,4
Get her off me!


413
0:34:52,4 --> 0:34:58,96
Look out, Vince. Look out!


414
0:34:58,96 --> 0:35:13,24
Fuck! Come on!


415
0:35:13,24 --> 0:35:24,12
Yeah!


416
0:35:24,12 --> 0:35:29,2
Oh, look at your teeth!


417
0:35:29,2 --> 0:35:47,44
Fuckin' hell! Patrick!


418
0:35:47,44 --> 0:35:52,72
- We should start placing bets.
- My money's on that one.


419
0:35:52,72 --> 0:35:58,24
Let's go!


420
0:35:58,24 --> 0:36:0,64
Everyone stay together!


421
0:36:0,64 --> 0:36:33,64
Here, here! Quick, come on.


422
0:36:33,64 --> 0:36:55,24
Fuckin' hell.


423
0:36:55,24 --> 0:37:11,24
(Match Of The Day)


424
0:37:11,24 --> 0:37:20,84
She'll be through that freakin' window
in a minute. Grab anything you can.


425
0:37:20,84 --> 0:37:25,16
- Vince!
- What?


426
0:37:25,16 --> 0:37:29,88
Still in its original packaging!


427
0:37:29,88 --> 0:37:32,96
Weapons, Matt.
Grab any weapons you can.


428
0:37:32,96 --> 0:37:35,44
Not fuckin' robots.


429
0:37:35,44 --> 0:37:43,12
All right... I'm looking.


430
0:37:43,12 --> 0:37:49,68
Did you lock that?


431
0:37:49,68 --> 0:37:51,24
Matt! Matt!


432
0:37:51,24 --> 0:37:54,72
Where are you going? Matt!


433
0:37:54,72 --> 0:37:57,96
I'm coming!


434
0:37:57,96 --> 0:38:1,8
Weapons... Weapons...


435
0:38:1,8 --> 0:38:3,96
Matt! Matt!


436
0:38:3,96 --> 0:38:6,92
- What are you doing?
- Give us a lighter!


437
0:38:6,92 --> 0:38:17,64
In me pocket...
THE OTHER POCKET!


438
0:38:17,64 --> 0:38:21,8
Get back. If they can't see us,
they'll forget we're in here.


439
0:38:21,8 --> 0:38:39,92
- That's optimistic, innit?
- They are easily confused.


440
0:38:39,92 --> 0:38:43,68
NOW you decide to shoot someone,
you fucking monkey's arse-ring.


441
0:38:43,68 --> 0:38:47,24
You had a gun all along?


442
0:38:47,24 --> 0:38:50,52
I was saving the last bullet
for when I needed it.


443
0:38:50,52 --> 0:38:56,84
You're still a twat.


444
0:38:56,84 --> 0:39:1,92
Fuck, I think you've just sent out
a party invite.


445
0:39:1,92 --> 0:39:4,48
Do they sell petrol in toy shops?


446
0:39:4,48 --> 0:39:6,4
No.


447
0:39:6,4 --> 0:39:11,12
It's Nitro Fluid for radio-controlled cars.


448
0:39:11,12 --> 0:39:13,16
Don't you know anything?!


449
0:39:13,16 --> 0:39:41,8
I know we need to be tooled up with
something that wasn't made in Taiwan.


450
0:39:41,8 --> 0:39:46,24
Who taught you to drive?
Let me have a go.


451
0:39:46,24 --> 0:39:53,84
Get off!


452
0:39:53,84 --> 0:40:7,2
Reverse. Reverse. Over here!


453
0:40:7,2 --> 0:40:10,2
<i>Hello? Are we in there?</i>


454
0:40:10,2 --> 0:40:13,64
- I take it you're in a toy shop.
- Who's there? Is Neil there?


455
0:40:13,64 --> 0:40:15,96
No, just me, Mikey
and the Milky Bar Kid.


456
0:40:15,96 --> 0:40:17,92
- My name's Gavin.
- Whatever.


457
0:40:17,92 --> 0:40:21,0
The speed Neil was running,
he's probably halfway home.

You're so sexy, do you know that?

<i># The female of the species

463
0:40:52,56 --> 0:40:57,6
Why don't we forget about all this?
This finger food.


464
0:40:57,6 --> 0:40:59,76
That's a really lovely spread.


465
0:40:59,76 --> 0:41:6,36
But why don't we
just take this upstairs, eh?


466
0:41:6,36 --> 0:41:9,64
We're both adults.


467
0:41:9,64 --> 0:41:13,56
I'm a man...


468
0:41:13,56 --> 0:41:18,76
You're a...


469
0:41:18,76 --> 0:41:22,72
You're a woman.


470
0:41:22,72 --> 0:41:26,96
This could be the start
of something special - you and me...


471
0:41:26,96 --> 0:41:30,28
All you've gotta do...


472
0:41:30,28 --> 0:41:37,12
is... untie me, yeah?


473
0:41:37,12 --> 0:41:56,6
Just untie me, please.


474
0:41:56,6 --> 0:42:1,52
Come on, then. Come on!


475
0:42:1,52 --> 0:42:14,64
No, no, don't do that. No.

<i>Anxiety is nothing more

0:42:22,76 --> 0:42:26,52
So, what's the plan?


479
0:42:26,52 --> 0:42:28,92
What do you mean what's the plan?


480
0:42:28,92 --> 0:42:31,24
The plan. What's the plan?


481
0:42:31,24 --> 0:42:34,2
- I haven't got one. What's yours?
- I've got a plan.


482
0:42:34,2 --> 0:42:37,32
What's all this bollocks
with the walkie-talkies, then?


483
0:42:37,32 --> 0:42:40,84
Just fancied a chat about
something other than Star Wars.


484
0:42:40,84 --> 0:42:47,32
Oh... How is Matt?


485
0:42:47,32 --> 0:42:56,96
Yeah, the force is with him.


486
0:42:56,96 --> 0:42:59,8
- Oi!
- What?


487
0:42:59,8 --> 0:43:2,2
I said I've got a plan.


488
0:43:2,2 --> 0:43:3,68
Go on, then.


489
0:43:3,68 --> 0:43:6,32
You're the double hard bastard.
You do it.


490
0:43:6,32 --> 0:43:8,36
It's your plan, arsehole.

0:43:8,36 --> 0:43:16,64
You two are so gay!

0:43:16,64 --> 0:43:23,64
Your mum's an arsehole.

0:43:23,64 --> 0:43:26,4
The payload has been delivered.


494
0:43:26,4 --> 0:43:27,68
What?


495
0:43:27,68 --> 0:43:38,92
The head's in the truck, man.
You ready?


496
0:43:38,92 --> 0:43:42,8
We're gonna need a diversion
for our diversion.


497
0:43:42,8 --> 0:43:54,32
I'm on it.


498
0:43:54,32 --> 0:44:40,56
Come and get your meals on wheels.


499
0:44:40,56 --> 0:44:57,24
No!


500
0:44:57,24 --> 0:45:0,52
Fuck off!


501
0:45:0,52 --> 0:45:5,32
Do the horn.


502
0:45:5,32 --> 0:45:13,72
You're not getting the better of me.


503
0:45:13,72 --> 0:45:15,88
Turn it, you're gonna go
out of range!


504
0:45:15,88 --> 0:45:18,28
I'm turning it. I'm turning it!


505
0:45:18,28 --> 0:45:22,96
Get off!


506
0:45:22,96 --> 0:45:31,76
Oh, f... No!


507
0:45:31,76 --> 0:45:39,4
- Oh, that's disgusting.
- Fuckin' hell.

0:45:39,4 --> 0:45:47,32
Fucking thing!

0:45:47,32 --> 0:45:51,32
- How could things get any worse?
- Mikey?


510
0:45:51,32 --> 0:46:2,12
- Yeah?
- Mikey, they've spotted you.


511
0:46:2,12 --> 0:46:24,28
Great.


512
0:46:24,28 --> 0:46:59,16
Yum!


513
0:46:59,16 --> 0:47:1,84
Mikey?


514
0:47:1,84 --> 0:47:3,8
Mikey?


515
0:47:3,8 --> 0:47:5,72
Mikey!


516
0:47:5,72 --> 0:47:7,24
Fuck.


517
0:47:7,24 --> 0:47:9,92
- Come on. Let's go.
- No, wait. Wait.


518
0:47:9,92 --> 0:47:14,92
I am not going out there half-cocked.


519
0:47:14,92 --> 0:47:18,4
Let's party.


520
0:47:18,4 --> 0:47:21,0
Where's mine?


521
0:47:21,0 --> 0:47:24,68
Well, there's only one.


522
0:47:24,68 --> 0:47:30,68
No, look, got a spare.


523
0:47:30,68 --> 0:47:32,88
No?


524
0:47:32,88 --> 0:47:36,76
All right, you can have my backup.


525
0:47:36,76 --> 0:47:39,76
What's this?


526
0:47:39,76 --> 0:47:42,92
I will make you feel sexy.


527
0:47:42,92 --> 0:47:44,92
Yeah!


528
0:47:44,92 --> 0:47:48,4
Right, then. Come on, Vince.
Me and you - Butch and Sundance!


529
0:47:48,4 --> 0:47:51,24
- They both died.
- Yeah!


530
0:47:51,24 --> 0:48:7,32
- Come on, you gimp. Let's go.
- Yeah!


531
0:48:7,32 --> 0:48:10,8
Do your fire thing! Do the fire thing!


532
0:48:10,8 --> 0:48:34,2
Hurry up!


533
0:48:34,2 --> 0:49:27,4
Oh, shit!


534
0:49:27,4 --> 0:49:33,16
Ta.


535
0:49:33,16 --> 0:49:34,8
What do we do now?


536
0:49:34,8 --> 0:49:38,36
We do what everyone else does,
when they're facing mortality.


537
0:49:38,36 --> 0:49:42,92
Run.


538
0:49:42,92 --> 0:49:48,72
Wait, wait.
I bet you a tenner it's locked.


539
0:49:48,72 --> 0:49:53,28
- Bollocks.
- You owe me tenner.


540
0:49:53,28 --> 0:50:5,4
Oh, my God.


541
0:50:5,4 --> 0:50:12,0
Look, look.


542
0:50:12,0 --> 0:50:15,36
<i>Mikey? Neil? Is anyone there?</i>


543
0:50:15,36 --> 0:50:20,48
- Where's the walkie-talkie?
- Lads, can you hear me?


544
0:50:20,48 --> 0:50:24,24
Me and Matt, we're in the church
but we've lock ed the doors.


545
0:50:24,24 --> 0:50:35,24
So if you get over here, please
just let me know. Try and get over here.


546
0:50:35,24 --> 0:50:37,4
We have to get out of here.


547
0:50:37,4 --> 0:50:40,96
Let's follow your mates over
to the church. It's our best chance.


548
0:50:40,96 --> 0:50:45,0
I think it's a bit late
to start praying, don't you?


549
0:50:45,0 --> 0:50:48,0
You feeling all right, mate?


550
0:50:48,0 --> 0:50:50,56
I have just had a genius idea.


551
0:50:50,56 --> 0:50:55,28
- Is everyone ready?
- You're loving this, aren't you?


552
0:50:55,28 --> 0:50:57,44
- Garry?
- It's Gavin.


553
0:50:57,44 --> 0:51:3,4
Let's just get it over with.


554
0:51:3,4 --> 0:51:5,8
- What?
- You've done this before, haven't you?


555
0:51:5,8 --> 0:51:9,24
- Don't get any funny ideas
- Don't worry, he's not a lesbian.


556
0:51:9,24 --> 0:51:13,72
- Is this gonna work or what?
- Let's try.


557
0:51:13,72 --> 0:51:40,28
Here she is!


558
0:51:40,28 --> 0:51:46,16
Vince, open the church door.


559
0:51:46,16 --> 0:51:59,8
Oh, fuck.


560
0:51:59,8 --> 0:52:3,4
- Fuckin' hell.
- Come on, come on!


561
0:52:3,4 --> 0:52:31,8
No, no, no! Don't go in there!
Don't go in there!


562
0:52:31,8 --> 0:52:37,88
Wait! That's my 9-iron.


563
0:52:37,88 --> 0:52:46,92
Come on!


564
0:52:46,92 --> 0:52:51,48
- Oh, Christ, it's the ex.
- Vince, we're outside. Open the door.


565
0:52:51,48 --> 0:52:55,24
Don't move, just keep smiling.


566
0:52:55,24 --> 0:52:59,32
Our clothes are in there! Shit!


567
0:52:59,32 --> 0:53:7,12
Oh, for fuck's sake, Julie.
We split up, get over it!


568
0:53:7,12 --> 0:53:10,12
All right, gays... guys!


569
0:53:10,12 --> 0:53:15,8
- Where did you come from?
- I took the scenic route.


570
0:53:15,8 --> 0:53:19,0
Come on.


571
0:53:19,0 --> 0:53:22,24
I hate you. I hate you.


572
0:53:22,24 --> 0:53:54,44
Why don't you just sit on me
and get it over with, you fat fucking pig!


573
0:53:54,44 --> 0:53:56,6
Vince.


574
0:53:56,6 --> 0:54:1,32
- I really wanna go home.
- OK. OK, let's go.


575
0:54:1,32 --> 0:54:5,52
Let's go home.


576
0:54:5,52 --> 0:54:9,12
Vince, are you taking piss?
This isn't funny any more.


577
0:54:9,12 --> 0:54:12,8
- Let us in.
- Hold on, we're coming.


578
0:54:12,8 --> 0:54:15,8
- Come on, hurry up!
- What are they doing?


579
0:54:15,8 --> 0:54:19,2
- What are you doing...
- What the fuck's this?!


580
0:54:19,2 --> 0:54:21,64
- Don't laugh at me!
- Neil! Neil!


581
0:54:21,64 --> 0:54:24,48
- Oi!
- Where the fuck have you been?


582
0:54:24,48 --> 0:54:28,72
(Bad-ass Crazy Lady)


583
0:54:28,72 --> 0:54:31,6
<i># She's dressed to kill
Oh, what a thrill</i>


584
0:54:31,6 --> 0:54:33,76
<i># Mess with her
And you're bound to get ill</i>


585
0:54:33,76 --> 0:54:36,44
<i># She'll chew you up and spit you out</i>


586
0:54:36,44 --> 0:54:39,16
- # She'll leave a scar...
- Hello, girls.


587
0:54:39,16 --> 0:54:42,52
- # She knows what she likes...
- Who's first?


588
0:54:42,52 --> 0:54:45,36
<i># She looks at me with those crazy eyes</i>


589
0:54:45,36 --> 0:54:47,64
<i># Takes no time for me to realise</i>


590
0:54:47,64 --> 0:54:50,0
<i># She's a wild-eyed crazy lady</i>


591
0:54:50,0 --> 0:54:52,64
<i># Bad-ass crazy lady</i>


592
0:54:52,64 --> 0:54:55,44
<i># Bad-ass crazy lady</i>


593
0:54:55,44 --> 0:55:2,4
<i># Bad-ass crazy lady</i>


594
0:55:2,4 --> 0:55:4,56
<i># Wild-eyed crazy lady</i>


595
0:55:4,56 --> 0:55:6,68
<i># Bad-ass crazy lady</i>


596
0:55:6,68 --> 0:55:10,12
- # Wild-eyed crazy lady... #
- I'll call you.


597
0:55:10,12 --> 0:55:13,44
Show's over. Everyone get inside.


598
0:55:13,44 --> 0:55:16,52
- I don't think so.
- Is that supposed to frighten me?


599
0:55:16,52 --> 0:55:20,0
- He said it would make me fell sexy.
- Does it?


600
0:55:20,0 --> 0:55:26,4
A little bit, yeah.


601
0:55:26,4 --> 0:55:27,8
Oh, for God's sake!


602
0:55:27,8 --> 0:55:35,56
Can we leave this male posturing
bullshit till later?


603
0:55:35,56 --> 0:55:46,0
Everyone get inside!


604
0:55:46,0 --> 0:55:50,36
I don't think I actually ever used
that finger for anything.


605
0:55:50,36 --> 0:55:53,64
- There's nothing up here.
- Come back, then.


606
0:55:53,64 --> 0:55:55,62
We're nearly there.


607
0:55:55,62 --> 0:55:58,32
Oh, shut up, you girl.


608
0:55:58,32 --> 0:56:0,64
That's it.


609
0:56:0,64 --> 0:56:2,76
Talking of girls...


610
0:56:2,76 --> 0:56:5,8
There's not even a spare
choir-boy outfit up there.


611
0:56:5,8 --> 0:56:8,52
Sit down, silly-bollocks,
you look gorgeous.


612
0:56:8,52 --> 0:56:14,2
- I think that butcher took a shine to you.
- Nah, she's not my type, that one.


613
0:56:14,2 --> 0:56:16,0
What about one of the others?


614
0:56:16,0 --> 0:56:19,28
- You would, wouldn't you?
- Don't you ever have a day off?


615
0:56:19,28 --> 0:56:23,36
There were 3 kinky birds
in that house.


616
0:56:23,36 --> 0:56:25,92
For second, I thought, you know...


617
0:56:25,92 --> 0:56:29,8
as long as they don't start
with that sicking-up bollocks...


618
0:56:29,8 --> 0:56:32,36
The one with the, um,
scissors is pretty fit.


619
0:56:32,36 --> 0:56:36,6
She'll have your bollocks for earrings
before you've even bought her a drink.


620
0:56:36,6 --> 0:56:39,4
- I like the one with the axe.
- She's married.


621
0:56:39,4 --> 0:56:42,8
I can't believe this!
You people have no respect for women.


622
0:56:42,8 --> 0:56:47,4
Oh, come on, Graham.
That's why you bat for the other side?


623
0:56:47,4 --> 0:56:49,44
All women are mental.


624
0:56:49,44 --> 0:56:53,92
You can't make that kind of sweeping
generalisation about an entire gender.


625
0:56:53,92 --> 0:56:56,88
Why not? Look at us.


626
0:56:56,88 --> 0:57:1,8
Look at Vince. His glory days are over.
His missus did that to him.


627
0:57:1,8 --> 0:57:4,96
He was king when he met her.
She turned him into a fucking ghost.


628
0:57:4,96 --> 0:57:9,4
We brought him out here to convince
him that all women aren't out to get him.


629
0:57:9,4 --> 0:57:11,36
Yeah, thanks for that, lads.


630
0:57:11,36 --> 0:57:19,16
It's all gone really fuckin' well, innit?


631
0:57:19,16 --> 0:57:21,96
- What are you looking for?
- Yes.


632
0:57:21,96 --> 0:57:24,0
This.


633
0:57:24,0 --> 0:57:26,16
I've done it!


634
0:57:26,16 --> 0:57:32,8
Right.


635
0:57:32,8 --> 0:57:42,92
Wow, we've got the whole village
under surveillance.


636
0:57:42,92 --> 0:57:45,64
Well, it's about time.


637
0:57:45,64 --> 0:57:48,32
You've been offline for nearly 24 hours.


638
0:57:48,32 --> 0:57:52,44
And why was my so-called escort
called back to Moodley last night,


639
0:57:52,44 --> 0:57:55,72
and left me chained
to the fucking briefcase?


640
0:57:55,72 --> 0:58:3,84
That's Meg Nut from the poster, look.


641
0:58:3,84 --> 0:58:7,88
Who are you?


642
0:58:7,88 --> 0:58:11,4
You're not involved
with Project Cat-house.


643
0:58:11,4 --> 0:58:22,0
Where's the Colonel?


644
0:58:22,0 --> 0:58:30,8
- Get her back.
- It's on fire.


645
0:58:30,8 --> 0:58:35,16
It's happening.


646
0:58:35,16 --> 0:58:37,0
- What's happening?
- Phase II.


647
0:58:37,0 --> 0:58:40,84
Hold on a minute. What's Phase I?


648
0:58:40,84 --> 0:58:44,56
Sickness, disorientation, psychosis.


649
0:58:44,56 --> 0:58:46,64
Phase II is the mutation.


650
0:58:46,64 --> 0:59:13,16
They're gonna get smarter,
faster and weirder.


651
0:59:13,16 --> 0:59:15,8
- What's that?
- It's called The Dolphin.


652
0:59:15,8 --> 0:59:19,4
There are high-frequency
sonic deterrents all over the village,


653
0:59:19,4 --> 0:59:21,4
emitting painful sound
only women can hear.


654
0:59:21,4 --> 0:59:25,16
- So there was a fail-safe all along.
- It only works after Phase II.


655
0:59:25,16 --> 0:59:40,68
- Obviously.
- Well, stop talking and press the button.


656
0:59:40,68 --> 0:59:43,8
- Is it working?
- I dunno.


657
0:59:43,8 --> 0:59:50,2
Can YOU hear it?


658
0:59:50,2 --> 0:59:52,48
Um, that doesn't work, does it?


659
0:59:52,48 --> 0:59:55,4
This isn't funny.
They'll be relentless now.


660
0:59:55,4 --> 0:59:57,4
They hunt in packs. We are fucked!


661
0:59:57,4 --> 1:0:1,84
For the sake of clarity, we're not dealing
with few insane women any more.


662
1:0:1,84 --> 1:0:4,24
What you boys
have actually created here


663
1:0:4,24 --> 1:0:8,64
is an army of pissed off,
man-hating, feminist cannibals.


664
1:0:8,64 --> 1:0:13,16
This biological weapon can turn one half
of the population against the other.


665
1:0:13,16 --> 1:0:17,8
- We can fight wars with no armies.
- So this is a test run?


666
1:0:17,8 --> 1:0:20,72
You set the virus loose
in an isolated little village


667
1:0:20,72 --> 1:0:22,96
and then sit and watch it on the telly?


668
1:0:22,96 --> 1:0:26,4
They used to do this kind of thing
in the '50s with LSD.


669
1:0:26,4 --> 1:0:29,76
Thanks, Matthew. What does
Meg Nut have to do with this?


670
1:0:29,76 --> 1:0:34,52
- Not much. She's just a delivery girl.
- Yeah. But delivering WHAT?


671
1:0:34,52 --> 1:0:37,84
How fucking stupid are you people?
What do you think?


672
1:0:37,84 --> 1:0:45,28
A free box of Wundawash?


673
1:0:45,28 --> 1:0:49,4
The virus
is in the washing powder, look.


674
1:0:49,4 --> 1:1:0,64
It's biological.


675
1:1:0,64 --> 1:1:6,16
Everybody, get back.


676
1:1:6,16 --> 1:1:9,96
- Leave her out of it. That's my nan.
- I thought she was on a cruise.


677
1:1:9,96 --> 1:1:13,44
Yeah... So did I.


678
1:1:13,44 --> 1:1:41,84
Matt. Matt, no!


679
1:1:41,84 --> 1:1:45,32
You've, um...


680
1:1:45,32 --> 1:1:54,24
There's some stuff on your face.


681
1:1:54,24 --> 1:2:4,12
All right, Matt?


682
1:2:4,12 --> 1:2:7,8
Thank you.


683
1:2:7,8 --> 1:2:10,52
Don't go in there, Matt.
It's the mortuary.


684
1:2:10,52 --> 1:2:12,52
I think he's traumatised.


685
1:2:12,52 --> 1:2:16,92
I'm the one who's fucking traumatised!
Look what he did to my nan.


686
1:2:16,92 --> 1:2:23,16
Matt? Matt?


687
1:2:23,16 --> 1:2:29,4
Matt...


688
1:2:29,4 --> 1:2:41,32
Vince. Run, run!


689
1:2:41,32 --> 1:2:43,72
What's happened?


690
1:2:43,72 --> 1:2:45,6
Is he all right?


691
1:2:45,6 --> 1:2:48,68
No.


692
1:2:48,68 --> 1:2:51,32
So, where is he, then?


693
1:2:51,32 --> 1:3:34,12
He's dead.


694
1:3:34,12 --> 1:3:50,84
Come on!


695
1:3:50,84 --> 1:3:53,84
That's for Matt...


696
1:3:53,84 --> 1:4:2,12
bitch.


697
1:4:2,12 --> 1:4:5,88
Shit, shit...


698
1:4:5,88 --> 1:4:9,88
- Look at the state of him.
- We can't just leave him here.


699
1:4:9,88 --> 1:4:14,28
What, in mortuary?
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.


700
1:4:14,28 --> 1:4:19,96
I'm just as freaked out as you are.


701
1:4:19,96 --> 1:4:35,52
What was that?


702
1:4:35,52 --> 1:4:42,0
Vince, don't go down there,
that's how she got in.


703
1:4:42,0 --> 1:5:28,88
Yeah, and it might be our only way out.


704
1:5:28,88 --> 1:5:33,48
- It's the other half of Moodley.
- Jesus, it's all the men.


705
1:5:33,48 --> 1:5:42,8
- You mean parts of them.
- It's a nest.


706
1:5:42,8 --> 1:5:49,92
Come on, come on!


707
1:5:49,92 --> 1:6:4,4
- Get up, come on!
- Get up!


708
1:6:4,4 --> 1:6:10,28
Get up the stairs! Come on!


709
1:6:10,28 --> 1:6:12,4
Vince, Vince! Come on!


710
1:6:12,4 --> 1:6:17,28
- Neil! Neil!
- Close the door!


711
1:6:17,28 --> 1:6:31,92
Neil, give us a hand with this!


712
1:6:31,92 --> 1:6:34,96
Hurry up, will ya?


713
1:6:34,96 --> 1:6:37,64
Oi, what are you pair of tarts
doing up there?


714
1:6:37,64 --> 1:6:40,8
Banksy, what time do you call this?


715
1:6:40,8 --> 1:6:45,12
You would not believe
the shit day I've had.


716
1:6:45,12 --> 1:6:47,32
- What's going on?
- Listen, soft-lad,


717
1:6:47,32 --> 1:6:51,76
outside Mikey's nan's house, there's
a big ladder, go and bring it back here.


718
1:6:51,76 --> 1:6:53,68
What's with the...


719
1:6:53,68 --> 1:6:57,12
- Get the fucking ladder, soppy bollocks.
- Hurry up.


720
1:6:57,12 --> 1:7:1,64
All right, all right,
don't get all aggressive.


721
1:7:1,64 --> 1:7:4,8
Fuck, help me out!


722
1:7:4,8 --> 1:7:6,96
- Get your ass outside.
- I think I'll stay a bit.


723
1:7:6,96 --> 1:7:11,2
Get your ass outside now.
Go, fuck off.


724
1:7:11,2 --> 1:7:12,92
Pat, go on.


725
1:7:12,92 --> 1:7:15,8
- All right?
- Vince?


726
1:7:15,8 --> 1:7:18,28
Hurry up!


727
1:7:18,28 --> 1:7:23,48
I can see your bikini line from here.
What's with the frock?


728
1:7:23,48 --> 1:7:26,2
- What are you doing?
- Vince said a get ladder.


729
1:7:26,2 --> 1:7:29,16
So we can get down, you plank,
not so you can get up.


730
1:7:29,16 --> 1:7:31,96
- What's happening?
- All the women have gone evil.


731
1:7:31,96 --> 1:7:35,6
One of them ate Neil's finger,
Matt killed me nan with a 9-iron


732
1:7:35,6 --> 1:7:39,4
and now he's dead, and we need
to get down the sodding ladder. Down.


733
1:7:39,4 --> 1:7:42,48
You lot been taking drugs?


734
1:7:42,48 --> 1:7:45,84
- You got some left?
- Get down, get down!


735
1:7:45,84 --> 1:7:55,36
Move, move!


736
1:7:55,36 --> 1:8:3,36
Go back up!


737
1:8:3,36 --> 1:8:6,68
We're alive!


738
1:8:6,68 --> 1:8:11,64
Let go!


739
1:8:11,64 --> 1:8:13,4
Who's the monster?


740
1:8:13,4 --> 1:8:18,24
- What are you still doing here?
- Wishing I wasn't.


741
1:8:18,24 --> 1:8:21,12
- Come on!
- Come on, Pat. Come here.


742
1:8:21,12 --> 1:8:26,76
- Come on, Pat.
- Watch his leg!


743
1:8:26,76 --> 1:8:29,8
- Graham, come on, let's go.
- You go.


744
1:8:29,8 --> 1:8:52,68
I'm right behind you.


745
1:8:52,68 --> 1:8:57,88
Fuck me.


746
1:8:57,88 --> 1:9:3,92
Fuckin' hell.


747
1:9:3,92 --> 1:9:10,36
This is worse than
the fucking Pamplona Bull Run.


748
1:9:10,36 --> 1:9:35,88
Fuckin' hell!


749
1:9:35,88 --> 1:9:39,8
Jesus!


750
1:9:39,8 --> 1:9:48,2
- Get the ladder. Get the ladder.
- What's this one?


751
1:9:48,2 --> 1:9:56,68
Come on!


752
1:9:56,68 --> 1:10:8,48
- Come on!
- Vince, Vince...


753
1:10:8,48 --> 1:10:11,36
- Banksy, give us your phone.
- I left it at home.


754
1:10:11,36 --> 1:10:13,84
Right, of course, yeah...


755
1:10:13,84 --> 1:10:15,6
Where are you parked, then?


756
1:10:15,6 --> 1:10:26,56
Behind the big billboard lying
across the street.


757
1:10:26,56 --> 1:10:28,72
What's that?


758
1:10:28,72 --> 1:10:33,52
- It's a rental.
- It's a rental?


759
1:10:33,52 --> 1:10:36,2
What do you mean it's a rental?
Where's your van?


760
1:10:36,2 --> 1:10:38,36
- It broke down, I forgot.
- You forgot?


761
1:10:38,36 --> 1:10:40,88
Repeating everything I say
ain't gonna help, Vince.


762
1:10:40,88 --> 1:10:43,6
What's not gonna help
is that fuckin' moon buggy.


763
1:10:43,6 --> 1:10:46,48
Maybe we can squeeze in.
I'll sit on someone's lap.


764
1:10:46,48 --> 1:10:51,8
Shut up. Forget it, it's too small.
Why did you even get here?


765
1:10:51,8 --> 1:10:54,2
- What are you trying to say?
- This trip was bad a idea.


766
1:10:54,2 --> 1:10:56,2
No... really?


767
1:10:56,2 --> 1:11:0,4
- It could be worse.
- It could be worse?


768
1:11:0,4 --> 1:11:3,88
How many fingers am I holding up?
They're fucking eating us!


769
1:11:3,88 --> 1:11:7,6
- How can it get any worse?
- Can everyone shut the fuck up?


770
1:11:7,6 --> 1:11:13,0
Cracking skulls open with a 9-iron
is not my idea of golfing holiday!


771
1:11:13,0 --> 1:11:16,8
But this is not Mikey's fault,
and it's not Banksy's.


772
1:11:16,8 --> 1:11:20,44
I'm sure as fucking shit,
it's not mine either.


773
1:11:20,44 --> 1:11:23,24
Relax... Relax...


774
1:11:23,24 --> 1:11:28,52
Now, we all need to work together
to facilitate some kind of positive -


775
1:11:28,52 --> 1:11:48,32
and I mean POSITIVE escape scenario,
'cause I'm not dying in this shit hole!


776
1:11:48,32 --> 1:11:54,68
<i>There's nothing wrong with you
that can't be fixed with a smile.</i>


777
1:11:54,68 --> 1:11:59,2
Get on the bus.


778
1:11:59,2 --> 1:12:2,12
Come on!


779
1:12:2,12 --> 1:12:14,4
Ruth!


780
1:12:14,4 --> 1:12:15,88
Banksy!


781
1:12:15,88 --> 1:12:29,92
Banksy!


782
1:12:29,92 --> 1:12:37,52
Banksy!


783
1:12:37,52 --> 1:12:40,48
Come on! I've had enough
of standing here!


784
1:12:40,48 --> 1:12:43,64
I'll fuckin stick it in ya!
I'll fucking stick it in ya!


785
1:12:43,64 --> 1:12:45,76
Get in the fucking bus!


786
1:12:45,76 --> 1:12:49,24
I'm fucking sick of it! Fuck!


787
1:12:49,24 --> 1:12:55,2
Come on, Vince, let's go!
Let's go!


788
1:12:55,2 --> 1:13:0,68
- What are you doing?
- I'm having a mid-life crisis.


789
1:13:0,68 --> 1:13:3,0
What, now? Can't it wait?


790
1:13:3,0 --> 1:13:4,52
No.


791
1:13:4,52 --> 1:13:9,6
Well, it's about fucking time.


792
1:13:9,6 --> 1:13:12,4
Anyone seen me lighter?


793
1:13:12,4 --> 1:13:16,84
Where's me lighter?


794
1:13:16,84 --> 1:13:24,56
Oi, look after it next time, yeah?


795
1:13:24,56 --> 1:13:28,92
You know, I always thought you two
were completely fucking useless.


796
1:13:28,92 --> 1:13:32,48
You - you just follow your dick
like it's a fucking compass.


797
1:13:32,48 --> 1:13:36,52
And you - you're letting your marriage
slip through your fucking fingers.


798
1:13:36,52 --> 1:13:39,0
Neither of you
know anything about women.


799
1:13:39,0 --> 1:13:43,2
- So why are you two still fuckin' alive?
- We're not gonna be for much longer,


800
1:13:43,2 --> 1:13:48,2
if you don't stop yapping
and get us out of here!


801
1:13:48,2 --> 1:13:54,2
The rest of us, we try to do everything
by the book - and we get shafted.


802
1:13:54,2 --> 1:13:56,76
We try to be what they want us to be.


803
1:13:56,76 --> 1:14:4,24
You know, we become reliable,
mature, domesticated.


804
1:14:4,24 --> 1:14:6,52
And then what happens?


805
1:14:6,52 --> 1:14:13,16
They get bored -
that's what happens.


806
1:14:13,16 --> 1:14:20,84
If all women really want is pet,
why don't they buy a fucking Labrador?


807
1:14:20,84 --> 1:14:25,0
I've had enough,
being told to sit, and lie down,


808
1:14:25,0 --> 1:14:35,12
and roll over, and play dead.


809
1:14:35,12 --> 1:14:43,88
From now on,
what you see is what you get.


810
1:14:43,88 --> 1:14:45,64
For fuck's sake!


811
1:14:45,64 --> 1:14:48,44
Vince, you do know the road's blocked.


812
1:14:48,44 --> 1:14:52,6
Bollocks to the roadblock. I've been
living by the highway code all my life.


813
1:14:52,6 --> 1:14:56,24
Where did it get me?
A one-way ticket to Moodley.


814
1:14:56,24 --> 1:15:17,4
Buckle up, lads.
We're going off road.


815
1:15:17,4 --> 1:15:22,28
Vince, watch out for the old biddy.


816
1:15:22,28 --> 1:15:33,48
Whoa, easy, easy!


817
1:15:33,48 --> 1:15:41,56
Oh, my God!


818
1:15:41,56 --> 1:15:43,6
What was that?


819
1:15:43,6 --> 1:15:46,88
Fat bird.


820
1:15:46,88 --> 1:16:20,8
Slow down, Vince. Slow down.


821
1:16:20,8 --> 1:16:27,96
Hello, hello...


822
1:16:27,96 --> 1:16:30,12
Hello? Is anybody there?


823
1:16:30,12 --> 1:16:33,48
Graham, we thought you got squashed.
Where are you?


824
1:16:33,48 --> 1:16:36,72
In the nest with the stiffs.


825
1:16:36,72 --> 1:16:40,2
Where are you?


826
1:16:40,2 --> 1:16:44,2
Coming to get you, silly twat.


827
1:16:44,2 --> 1:17:43,2
Let's do it.


828
1:17:43,2 --> 1:17:47,52
Who's your favourite Spice Girl?


829
1:17:47,52 --> 1:17:51,96
Here's the plan. We're gonna
go down there, get Graham,


830
1:17:51,96 --> 1:17:55,24
piss off to the nearest pub,
somewhere much nicer than this,


831
1:17:55,24 --> 1:18:0,44
have a little bit of lunch and then get
absolutely shit-faced. Any questions?


832
1:18:0,44 --> 1:18:2,24
Yeah.


833
1:18:2,24 --> 1:18:6,24
You do realise
that we're slightly outnumbered, right?


834
1:18:6,24 --> 1:18:8,52
Pass one of them golf clubs.


835
1:18:8,52 --> 1:18:11,52
No, give me a wood.


836
1:18:11,52 --> 1:18:23,88
Give him wood as well.


837
1:18:23,88 --> 1:18:27,36
Right. We're outnumbered,
and outgunned.


838
1:18:27,36 --> 1:18:29,64
But I've got the hump.


839
1:18:29,64 --> 1:18:33,8
So we're gonna go down there
in a very ungentlemanly fashion


840
1:18:33,8 --> 1:18:37,4
and... present company
excepted, of course,


841
1:18:37,4 --> 1:18:41,32
bash the living shit
out of anything in a dress.


842
1:18:41,32 --> 1:18:44,96
Bloody hell, Vince...


843
1:18:44,96 --> 1:19:6,68
not very PC is it?


844
1:19:6,68 --> 1:19:13,12
Come on.


845
1:19:13,12 --> 1:19:26,6
Let's have it!


846
1:19:26,6 --> 1:19:33,96
Now what?


847
1:19:33,96 --> 1:19:37,2
Oi, oi!


848
1:19:37,2 --> 1:19:41,12
You all right?


849
1:19:41,12 --> 1:19:43,2
I've got it working.


850
1:19:43,2 --> 1:20:14,56
Let me see that, let me see that.


851
1:20:14,56 --> 1:20:17,84
Remote-controlled women.


852
1:20:17,84 --> 1:20:24,72
- Do it again, Neil!
- My word!


853
1:20:24,72 --> 1:20:27,16
Take that.


854
1:20:27,16 --> 1:20:37,76
Get in there, Graham.


855
1:20:37,76 --> 1:20:47,2
Be careful, Neil.


856
1:20:47,2 --> 1:20:50,24
Oh, I'm lovin' this.
Absolutely lovin' it.


857
1:20:50,24 --> 1:20:59,8
Lovely little thing,
ain't you, sweetheart, eh?


858
1:20:59,8 --> 1:21:2,44
Vince, you got to have
a bang on this, mate. Just have a bang!


859
1:21:2,44 --> 1:21:11,8
Bollocks!


860
1:21:11,8 --> 1:23:11,8
Go!
