CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: You might get in trouble
for having a messy room, but some students


2
0:0:5,49 --> 0:0:10,62
are helping clean up their country by trashing
their school. That`s coming up. I`m Carl Azuz,


3
0:0:10,62 --> 0:0:16,43
this is CNN STUDENT NEWS.


4
0:0:16,43 --> 0:0:29,999
We are going to start things off today in
Egypt. The country is going through some problems,


5
0:0:29,999 --> 0:0:34,82
some political unrest right now. People are
angry with Egypt`s president and their protesting


6
0:0:34,82 --> 0:0:40,48
against him. If that sounds familiar, it should:
nearly two years ago, Egypt was part of what


7
0:0:40,48 --> 0:0:45,17
some called the Arab Spring: the series of
uprisings across the Middle East and Northern


8
0:0:45,17 --> 0:0:50,54
Africa. That led to Egypt`s long time leader
being forced out of power. Egypt held its


9
0:0:50,54 --> 0:0:55,7
first free elections after that, and Mohamed
Morsi was elected president. We reported on


10
0:0:55,7 --> 0:1:1,89
Monday that Morsi announced that any decisions
he makes can`t be reviewed or overturned.


11
0:1:1,89 --> 0:1:7,25
He says he is trying to protect Egypt as it
build its new government. The protesters say,


12
0:1:7,25 --> 0:1:11,74
President Morsi is grabbing up power, kind
of like a dictator. Some of those protests


13
0:1:11,74 --> 0:1:16,17
have turned violent. Hundreds of people have
been injured, at least one person was killed.


14
0:1:16,17 --> 0:1:20,72
We are going to hop across the Atlantic and
head to Washington, D.C, specifically to the


15
0:1:20,72 --> 0:1:26,69
White House for a meeting between a president
and a president-elect. Enrique Pena Nieto


16
0:1:26,69 --> 0:1:31,27
was elected Mexico`s president back in July.
Now, he`s officially going to become president,


17
0:1:31,27 --> 0:1:35,88
to take office on Saturday. Yesterday, he
was in Washington, D.C. for a meeting with


18
0:1:35,88 --> 0:1:37,52
U.S. President Obama.


19
0:1:37,52 --> 0:1:41,74
Immigration, security and the drug war in
Mexico have been some of the biggest issues


20
0:1:41,74 --> 0:1:45,82
for these two countries recently. They were
expected to come up in yesterday`s meeting,


21
0:1:45,82 --> 0:1:50,96
too, but President Elect P said he wants the
relationship between the U.S. and Mexico to


22
0:1:50,96 --> 0:1:55,75
go beyond that. He said one of his biggest
goals is to strengthen the economic ties between


23
0:1:55,75 --> 0:2:0,33
the neighboring nations. The U.S. is Mexico`s
biggest trading partner, sharing billions


24
0:2:0,33 --> 0:2:2,6
of dollars in imports and exports.


25
0:2:2,6 --> 0:2:6,83
A lot of the action in our next story is happening
at the U.S. Capitol. That`s where members


26
0:2:6,83 --> 0:2:12,16
of Congress are considering the fiscal cliff
and how to avoid going over it. Now, really,


27
0:2:12,16 --> 0:2:16,86
what this comes down to, is debt. The U.S.
government has it: trillions of dollars worth.


28
0:2:16,86 --> 0:2:21,61
It`s got to try to find ways to reduce that
debt, and that`s where the fiscal cliff comes


29
0:2:21,61 --> 0:2:27,19
in. Now, it`s not an actual cliff, it`s an
economic one. And it involves two main things:


30
0:2:27,19 --> 0:2:33,12
one, how the government takes in money through
taxes and two, how it spends money.


31
0:2:33,12 --> 0:2:38,7
If the country goes over this fiscal cliff,
taxes will go up for everyone, plus government


32
0:2:38,7 --> 0:2:43,47
spending cuts will automatically go into a
fact. That would effect the military, national


33
0:2:43,47 --> 0:2:48,43
parks and other government services. If Congress
and the president can agree on ways to cut


34
0:2:48,43 --> 0:2:52,489
government debt, then the country won`t go
over the cliff. They`ve been working on that


35
0:2:52,489 --> 0:2:56,75
for a while, both sides have presented ideas,
there was even the special super committee


36
0:2:56,75 --> 0:3:2,489
in Congress that tried to come up with ways
to reduce the debt. So far, though, no deal.


37
0:3:2,489 --> 0:3:7,8
And the deadline now is January, First. If
a deal is not reached by then, that`s when


38
0:3:7,8 --> 0:3:10,5
the U.S. would go over this fiscal cliff.

0:3:11,72 --> 0:3:18,68
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Is this legit? Salmonella
is a type of virus.


41
0:3:18,68 --> 0:3:24,12
This one is not true. Salmonella are bacteria
that can cause food poisoning and other health


42
0:3:24,12 --> 0:3:25,12
problems.

0:3:25,12 --> 0:3:28,12

44
0:3:28,12 --> 0:3:34,849
AZUZ: Back in June, 41 people in 20 U.S. states
got sick because of a salmonella outbreak.


45
0:3:34,849 --> 0:3:38,66
Officials with the FDA, the Food and Drug
Administration, traced this outbreak to a


46
0:3:38,66 --> 0:3:45,239
peanut butter plant in New Mexico. On Monday,
regulators shut it down. Back in 2011, new


47
0:3:45,239 --> 0:3:50,629
food safety laws gave the FDA the power to
shut facilities down. This is the first time


48
0:3:50,629 --> 0:3:54,94
it`s done it. And an FDA report found the
conditions at the plant might have led to


49
0:3:54,94 --> 0:3:59,629
the products there being contaminated with
salmonella. A spokeswoman for the company


50
0:3:59,629 --> 0:4:4,209
that owns this plant says it`s working with
officials to get the proper health and safety


51
0:4:4,209 --> 0:4:5,25
procedures in place.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today`s "Shoutout" goes
out to coach Cochran`s, coach Julian`s and


54
0:4:11,159 --> 0:4:17,22
Mrs. McClanahan`s classes at Winfield High
School in Winfield, West Virginia.


55
0:4:17,22 --> 0:4:21,34
What Central American country is highlighted
on this map?


56
0:4:21,34 --> 0:4:28,99
You know what to do. Is it Costa Rica, Guatemala,
Honduras or Nicaragua? You`ve got three seconds,


57
0:4:28,99 --> 0:4:30,19
go!


58
0:4:30,19 --> 0:4:40,85
That`s Guatemala, a country that`s home to
more than 14 million people. That`s your answer


59
0:4:40,85 --> 0:4:42,93
and that`s your "Shoutout."

61
0:4:44,54 --> 0:4:49,9
AZUZ: A German fashion designer who lives
in Guatemala came up with an idea to help


62
0:4:49,9 --> 0:4:54,81
clean up the country: stuff trash inside empty
plastic bottles. After a hurricane ripped


63
0:4:54,81 --> 0:4:59,15
through her village, she realized her bottles
could be used to rebuild. That`s when the


64
0:4:59,15 --> 0:5:1,72
ecobrick was born.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I`m Susanna Heise (ph),
I`m the founder of the Pura Vida Movement.


67
0:5:13,53 --> 0:5:24,68
We are here in like Atitlan (ph), and this
is in Guatemala in Central America. And this


68
0:5:24,68 --> 0:5:27,96
is called the most beautiful lake on earth.


69
0:5:27,96 --> 0:5:35,59
In the `60s, this new material plastic came.
That was totally new for them, plastic is


70
0:5:35,59 --> 0:5:42,8
also -- it`s not a bad material, it helped
them a lot. But nobody told them like, look,


71
0:5:42,8 --> 0:5:49,31
this is not a leaf, this is not going to decompose.
This is going to stay here for 20, 30, 50,


72
0:5:49,31 --> 0:5:50,65
100, 500 years.


73
0:5:50,65 --> 0:5:55,15
CHRIS BARRY, FMR. PEACE CORP VOLUNTEER: The
trash problem is affecting these communities


74
0:5:55,15 --> 0:6:2,44
in several ways. Tourism is a big issue. Cyanobacteria
blows up in the lake. Tourists are no longer


75
0:6:2,44 --> 0:6:5,9
allowed to swim, and that region is very much
dependent on tourism.


76
0:6:5,9 --> 0:6:12,38
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: This is the Pura Vida,
famous Pura Vida wall, built out of 1,000


77
0:6:12,38 --> 0:6:18,59
ecobricks. And these ecobricks have been (inaudible)
by many children, kindergarten children.


78
0:6:18,59 --> 0:6:23,509
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It is trash and it is
a container for trash. And when it`s filled


79
0:6:23,509 --> 0:6:27,46
with trash, it has sufficient integrity to
be a building block.


80
0:6:27,46 --> 0:6:31,729
BARRY: And you use those as a basic building
material, and you are also -- are able to


81
0:6:31,729 --> 0:6:37,52
clean up the community and teach about environment
education and importance of maintaining a


82
0:6:37,52 --> 0:6:42,31
clean environment around you, trash management,
all that kind of good stuff.


83
0:6:42,31 --> 0:6:48,8
GERSON GUITZ, HUG IT FORWARD: We are building
a two-classroom school in a community in Pachai


84
0:6:48,8 --> 0:6:55,9
(ph). This school serves about 200 kids. As
you can see, it takes about 6,000 bottles


85
0:6:55,9 --> 0:6:58,97
to finish a whole construction, and this is
the last square that we are making right now.


86
0:6:58,97 --> 0:7:2,229
And we are tying all the bottles, all the
bottles have to be the same height.


87
0:7:2,229 --> 0:7:6,949
BARRY: People are really catching on to the
idea. Projects are growing in El Salvador,


88
0:7:6,949 --> 0:7:10,31
Guyana, I`ve heard of a similar type building
in Thailand.


89
0:7:10,31 --> 0:7:15,729
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It makes me so glad that
the idea of the (inaudible) is spreading from


90
0:7:15,729 --> 0:7:21,8
like Atitlan towards all Guatemala, towards
the whole world. That`ll be a part of the


91
0:7:21,8 --> 0:7:24,61
solution and not a part of the problem anymore.

AZUZ: All around Indianapolis, people are
showing their support for Chuck Pagano. He


94
0:7:32,53 --> 0:7:37,99
is the head coach of the NFL`s Indianapolis
Colts and he`s fighting cancer. A team cheerleader


95
0:7:37,99 --> 0:7:44,21
offered to shave her head if the team`s mascot
could raise $10,000 for cancer research. He


96
0:7:44,21 --> 0:7:49,259
raised $22,000. The cheerleader says she was
happy to lose her locks for the cause.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


98
0:7:50,9 --> 0:7:55,34
MEGAN M., COLTS CHEERLEADER: I wasn`t freaked
out. I was just so excited and proud of our


99
0:7:55,34 --> 0:8:0,78
city for pulling together for a great cause.
The cheers were deafening, it was just phenomenal,


100
0:8:0,78 --> 0:8:4,889
I was able to have another cheerleader join
me at the last minute and be able to hold


101
0:8:4,889 --> 0:8:9,4
her hand while we both went through this process.
It was just absolutely phenomenal, and, you


102
0:8:9,4 --> 0:8:12,949
know, everyone hopes to make an impact in
their life, and I was just lucky enough that


103
0:8:12,949 --> 0:8:15,949
Blue (ph) came up with this idea and we were
able to do something really good.


104
0:8:15,949 --> 0:8:16,91
(END VIDEO CLIP)


105
0:8:16,91 --> 0:8:21,55
AZUZ: Yesterday, we told you about the college
basketball record set by Jack Taylor. Most


106
0:8:21,55 --> 0:8:26,44
of you think, he is a basketball star. On
our blog, Haylie wrote, "Taylor deserves the


107
0:8:26,44 --> 0:8:30,33
new record because if you have skill, you
should be able to shine!"


108
0:8:30,33 --> 0:8:34,599
Brandon says "It`s unusual for anyone to score
that many points. Plus, he had the help of


109
0:8:34,599 --> 0:8:38,589
his coach and the team to get him the ball
to make those shots."


110
0:8:38,589 --> 0:8:43,39
And Ashley argues, "If Taylor`s team members
thought of him as a ball hog, they wouldn`t


111
0:8:43,39 --> 0:8:45,959
have continuously passed the ball to him."


112
0:8:45,959 --> 0:8:51,429
Brennan believes that scoring 138 points would
not make him a hero because he basically embarrassed


113
0:8:51,429 --> 0:8:56,55
the other team, and that beat down could turn
those other players off to basketball.


114
0:8:56,55 --> 0:9:1,79
Mark says, that while Taylor`s skills are
exceptional, "his teammates deserve more credit


115
0:9:1,79 --> 0:9:5,16
for things like playing great defense and
hustling down the floor."


116
0:9:5,16 --> 0:9:9,819
And from Olivia, "I do think he was a ball
hog, but does that term always have to be


117
0:9:9,819 --> 0:9:14,699
negative? He did his job and what he was told
to do. He is a star and the ball hog, and


118
0:9:14,699 --> 0:9:16,92
there is nothing wrong with that.


119
0:9:16,92 --> 0:9:20,6
Remember, when you were a kid, and you would
sit in the cart at the grocery store, that


120
0:9:20,6 --> 0:9:26,519
was kind of fun, right? This is the grownup
version. It`s 12 feet long, 9 feet tall. That


121
0:9:26,519 --> 0:9:28,809
guy must need a lot of groceries.


122
0:9:28,809 --> 0:9:33,889
This is just a publicity stunt, the super-sized
cart draws lots of lookers and shoppers, or


123
0:9:33,889 --> 0:9:38,899
at least that`s the plan. The store`s owner
spent two years and tens of thousands of dollars


124
0:9:38,899 --> 0:9:44,36
building it. He admits, he`s better with food
than four wheelers. So, it`s possible he had


125
0:9:44,36 --> 0:9:48,1
to work out some buggies, probably needed
a detailed map to figure it all out, that`s


126
0:9:48,1 --> 0:9:48,98
when you call on a cartographer.


127
0:9:48,98 --> 0:11:48,98
It`s time for us to hit the road, for CNN
STUDENT NEWS, I`m Carl Azuz. See you later.
