1
0:0:9,96 --> 0:0:17,52
Oi, get away from there.


2
0:0:17,52 --> 0:0:19,12
- Is it on ?
- Yeah, it's on.


3
0:0:19,12 --> 0:0:23,72
- D'you think it can hear us ?
- No.


4
0:0:23,72 --> 0:0:28,52
I love this guy.


5
0:0:28,52 --> 0:0:29,72
Hello ?


6
0:0:29,72 --> 0:0:31,84
- What you doing ?
- Nothing.


7
0:0:31,84 --> 0:0:33,6
- What's that ?
- It's an axe.


8
0:0:33,6 --> 0:0:35,44
It's a bit dangerous, isn't it ?


9
0:0:35,44 --> 0:0:37,28
- Yeah.
- Don't worry, Daisy.


10
0:0:37,28 --> 0:0:40,4
Mike knows exactly what he's doing.


11
0:0:40,4 --> 0:0:41,8
I think we should
lose the axe.


12
0:0:41,8 --> 0:0:44,52
- I like the axe.
- I like my face.


13
0:0:44,52 --> 0:0:49,48
- I like your face.
- Let's keep the axe.


14
0:0:49,48 --> 0:0:51,52
It is my great pleasure


15
0:0:51,52 --> 0:0:53,88
to introduce
the newly improved version


16
0:0:53,88 --> 0:0:56,12
of the single most
effective battle bot


17
0:0:56,12 --> 0:0:58,96
since Sir Killalot
first killed a lot.


18
0:0:58,96 --> 0:1:2,52
Ladies and gentlemen...


19
0:1:2,52 --> 0:1:4,36
Private Iron.


20
0:1:4,36 --> 0:1:5,92
Bloody hell.


21
0:1:5,92 --> 0:1:9,16
- It looks VERY dangerous.
- 0nly in the wrong hands.


22
0:1:9,16 --> 0:1:11,44
- D'you think he'll win ?
- Look at him.


23
0:1:11,44 --> 0:1:14,72
He can't lose.


24
0:1:14,72 --> 0:1:26,44
'... semifinal
and six contenders.'


25
0:1:26,44 --> 0:1:30,6
Daisy Ann Steiner. 25 years old.


26
0:1:30,6 --> 0:1:32,64
Hello.


27
0:1:32,64 --> 0:1:36,4
It says here you've had three
employers in as many weeks.


28
0:1:36,4 --> 0:1:38,4
Why do you think that is ?


29
0:1:38,4 --> 0:1:42,2
I don't know.
I just can't work it out.


30
0:1:42,2 --> 0:1:44,4
I think you can.


31
0:1:44,4 --> 0:1:47,48
I got sacked.


32
0:1:47,48 --> 0:1:49,72
- I got sacked.
- That's right.


33
0:1:49,72 --> 0:1:52,92
It seems you have a slight
problem with authority.


34
0:1:52,92 --> 0:1:55,56
Several of your employers
have reported to us


35
0:1:55,56 --> 0:1:57,6
a general lack of concentration.


36
0:1:57,6 --> 0:2:0,92
That you're belligerent and
often talk when unauthorised.


37
0:2:0,92 --> 0:2:3,72
- Bollocks.
- I'm trying to help you, Daisy.


38
0:2:3,72 --> 0:2:6,4
We can only do that if you help us.


39
0:2:6,4 --> 0:2:10,16
I know. I know. It's me.


40
0:2:10,16 --> 0:2:12,72
It's always been a problem of mine.


41
0:2:12,72 --> 0:2:15,92
It's like I've got these two
opposing forces inside me.


42
0:2:15,92 --> 0:2:17,72
'There's my sensible side.


43
0:2:17,72 --> 0:2:21,28
'She's polite, cooperative,
always does the right thing.'


44
0:2:21,28 --> 0:2:23,24
And then there's my reckless side.


45
0:2:23,24 --> 0:2:27,56
'She's a rebel. She hates authority.'


46
0:2:27,56 --> 0:2:29,4
'She knows what she wants.


47
0:2:29,4 --> 0:2:31,48
'She'll do anything to get it.'


48
0:2:31,48 --> 0:2:34,36
Better shape up, Daisy.
You better understand.


49
0:2:34,36 --> 0:2:36,96
Sometimes we have
to make compromises.


50
0:2:36,96 --> 0:2:39,28
- You're right.
- I've got you a placement.


51
0:2:39,28 --> 0:2:41,76
It's a restaurant.
Neo Nachos in Kentish Town.


52
0:2:41,76 --> 0:2:45,4
- Oh, I've been there. It's nice.
- You'll be in the kitchen.


53
0:2:45,4 --> 0:2:47,52
Right. Right.


54
0:2:47,52 --> 0:2:50,12
- Try not to lose this one.
- I will.


55
0:2:50,12 --> 0:2:57,76
I will. I will try.


56
0:2:57,76 --> 0:2:59,0
Not right.


57
0:2:59,0 --> 0:3:3,48
Shit. Shit.


58
0:3:3,48 --> 0:3:7,92
Need something else.


59
0:3:7,92 --> 0:3:10,88
It's shit.


60
0:3:10,88 --> 0:3:13,72
Shit.


61
0:3:13,72 --> 0:3:16,12
- Shit. Hello.
- Brian.


62
0:3:16,12 --> 0:3:18,16
Marty Berghaus. Reinhardt Gallery.


63
0:3:18,16 --> 0:3:19,68
- Hello.
- 'Hi.'


64
0:3:19,68 --> 0:3:21,72
I know this is short notice,


65
0:3:21,72 --> 0:3:24,6
but Paolo Vincenzo's pulled out
of the installation.


66
0:3:24,6 --> 0:3:26,0
Oh.


67
0:3:26,0 --> 0:3:29,56
Mm. His loss.
Shot himself in the foot really.


68
0:3:29,56 --> 0:3:32,56
- Why did he pull out ?
- He shot himself in the foot.


69
0:3:32,56 --> 0:3:35,52
Terrible mess. Very moving, though.


70
0:3:35,52 --> 0:3:39,2
- Could you fill in for him ?
- Me ?


71
0:3:39,2 --> 0:3:41,92
- 'Yes. Tomorrow evening. OK ? '
- Er...


72
0:3:41,92 --> 0:3:48,4
Great ! See you tomorrow.


73
0:3:48,4 --> 0:3:58,8
Shit !


74
0:3:58,8 --> 0:4:1,4
Hey !


75
0:4:1,4 --> 0:4:18,32
Hey !


76
0:4:18,32 --> 0:4:20,56
Looking great at the moment,
isn't he ?


77
0:4:20,56 --> 0:4:22,92
- Have a good weekend ?
- It was OK.


78
0:4:22,92 --> 0:4:37,0
- What'd you get up to ?
- You know. The usual.


79
0:4:37,0 --> 0:4:39,4
Well, well, well.


80
0:4:39,4 --> 0:4:41,8
If it isn't the triumphant roboteers.


81
0:4:41,8 --> 0:4:43,4
Hello, Dexter.


82
0:4:43,4 --> 0:4:46,12
Have you thought any more
about that rematch ?


83
0:4:46,12 --> 0:4:48,64
- Yes and no.
- What does that mean ?


84
0:4:48,64 --> 0:4:51,72
Yes, he's thought about it,
no, he doesn't want one. Right ?


85
0:4:51,72 --> 0:4:53,56
- Yes.
- So that's a no.


86
0:4:53,56 --> 0:4:55,16
Yes.


87
0:4:55,16 --> 0:4:57,24
The regionals are over.


88
0:4:57,24 --> 0:4:59,8
- We won fair and square.
- You were lucky !


89
0:4:59,8 --> 0:5:2,56
- We were better !
- Whoa. Come on, now,


90
0:5:2,56 --> 0:5:4,12
we don't want trouble.


91
0:5:4,12 --> 0:5:6,56
Maybe we were lucky.
The fact is, we won.


92
0:5:6,56 --> 0:5:8,64
All is fair in love and Robot Wars.


93
0:5:8,64 --> 0:5:11,4
I just want another shot.
I know a place.


94
0:5:11,4 --> 0:5:12,76
- Where ?
- You know.


95
0:5:12,76 --> 0:5:14,48
What if we get damaged ?


96
0:5:14,48 --> 0:5:16,44
The quarterfinals are next week.


97
0:5:16,44 --> 0:5:18,64
Oh, yeah. I hadn't thought of that.


98
0:5:18,64 --> 0:5:20,96
Mike, come on. Let's go.


99
0:5:20,96 --> 0:5:24,68
We'll be seeing you then, Michael.
Think about what I said.


100
0:5:24,68 --> 0:5:28,28
Say no.


101
0:5:28,28 --> 0:5:32,0
No.


102
0:5:32,0 --> 0:5:36,8
That's a real shame.


103
0:5:36,8 --> 0:5:38,6
God, it's always me, me, me.


104
0:5:38,6 --> 0:5:41,24
You've left home.
I'm not a bleedin' bank.


105
0:5:41,24 --> 0:5:44,44
Anyway, give us a call, love.


106
0:5:44,44 --> 0:5:50,96
Oh, it's your mum, by the way.


107
0:5:50,96 --> 0:5:53,8
Hello, Brian.


108
0:5:53,8 --> 0:5:55,72
Not been up in my region for a while.


109
0:5:55,72 --> 0:5:58,28
I've just come to get
my paint roller back.


110
0:5:58,28 --> 0:6:2,12
The big one ?


111
0:6:2,12 --> 0:6:3,36
There you go.


112
0:6:3,36 --> 0:6:6,32
Something exciting
happening downstairs ?


113
0:6:6,32 --> 0:6:8,64
Got an installation
at the Reinhardt Gallery.


114
0:6:8,64 --> 0:6:12,12
That's great ! We should celebrate !


115
0:6:12,12 --> 0:6:15,36
I've got a bottle
left over from yesterday.


116
0:6:15,36 --> 0:6:16,96
What was yesterday ?


117
0:6:16,96 --> 0:6:18,84
Er... Sunday.


118
0:6:18,84 --> 0:6:21,88
- When you installing yourself ?
- Tomorrow.


119
0:6:21,88 --> 0:6:24,88
Bloody 'ell.
That's a bit short notice.


120
0:6:24,88 --> 0:6:28,32
You better get on. Be terrible
with an 'alf-baked pile of crap.


121
0:6:28,32 --> 0:6:30,6
You'd look really stupid.


122
0:6:30,6 --> 0:6:32,92
Tell you what,
I'll come along.


123
0:6:32,92 --> 0:6:34,96
- N-no.
- No, no.


124
0:6:34,96 --> 0:6:37,48
I'll save the champers
for the big night.


125
0:6:37,48 --> 0:7:13,2
I'm sure I can resist
its charms till then.


126
0:7:13,2 --> 0:7:14,36
Excuse me.


127
0:7:14,36 --> 0:7:19,52
Do you know how I close my locker ?


128
0:7:19,52 --> 0:7:22,4
Y-You can't lock it.


129
0:7:22,4 --> 0:7:24,48
T-Tina keeps the keys.


130
0:7:24,48 --> 0:7:26,12
Daisy Steiner.


131
0:7:26,12 --> 0:7:29,16
- B-B-B-Billy.
- Glad to know you, Bill.


132
0:7:29,16 --> 0:7:37,72
Right, staff meeting.


133
0:7:37,72 --> 0:7:39,0
Is everybody here ?


134
0:7:39,0 --> 0:7:42,52
Let's get started.


135
0:7:42,52 --> 0:7:48,28
Any questions about the last meeting ?


136
0:7:48,28 --> 0:7:50,36
Billy ?


137
0:7:50,36 --> 0:7:53,72
Perhaps you'd like to start.


138
0:7:53,72 --> 0:7:59,4
- I have a question.
- Yes... Daisy ?


139
0:7:59,4 --> 0:8:1,96
Where can I get a key for my locker ?


140
0:8:1,96 --> 0:8:3,72
I have the keys.


141
0:8:3,72 --> 0:8:6,56
If you would like to use
your locker, come to me


142
0:8:6,56 --> 0:8:10,2
- and I will do it for you.
- That's not really fair.


143
0:8:10,2 --> 0:8:12,2
What if you're not here ?


144
0:8:12,2 --> 0:8:15,36
Some of us don't find it so
difficult to remain in work...


145
0:8:15,36 --> 0:8:17,28
Daisy.


146
0:8:17,28 --> 0:8:18,48
Right.


147
0:8:18,48 --> 0:8:23,4
Any more questions ? Billy...


148
0:8:23,4 --> 0:8:24,96
You'll be downstairs today.


149
0:8:24,96 --> 0:8:28,0
What ?


150
0:8:28,0 --> 0:8:30,36
N-N-No. I can't.


151
0:8:30,36 --> 0:8:34,48
Y-Y-Y-You can't make me.


152
0:8:34,48 --> 0:8:37,8
N-N-No !


153
0:8:37,8 --> 0:8:39,48
Meeting adjourned.


154
0:8:39,48 --> 0:8:42,72
Nooooo !


155
0:8:42,72 --> 0:8:44,44
OK, there we go.


156
0:8:44,44 --> 0:8:47,28
- Let's pub !
- Right ! I'll get my jacket.


157
0:8:47,28 --> 0:8:49,52
- Hello, Daisy.
- All right.


158
0:8:49,52 --> 0:8:51,4
- How was work ?
- Awful.


159
0:8:51,4 --> 0:8:52,96
- Get fired ?
- Not yet.


160
0:8:52,96 --> 0:8:54,84
- That's good.
- How's it going ?


161
0:8:54,84 --> 0:8:56,92
Fine. Just putting
finishing touches on.


162
0:8:56,92 --> 0:8:59,48
I thought you were gonna
do more drawings on it.


163
0:8:59,48 --> 0:9:1,76
- Why ?
- Well, millions of people


164
0:9:1,76 --> 0:9:9,12
would see your artwork.


165
0:9:9,12 --> 0:9:10,52
Tim ?


166
0:9:10,52 --> 0:9:12,88
Yeah. I just didn't feel like it.


167
0:9:12,88 --> 0:9:15,92
What does TFU stand for ?


168
0:9:15,92 --> 0:9:18,68
The Fuckest Uppest.
Philippa would have loved that.


169
0:9:18,68 --> 0:9:20,76
I didn't think she did it any more.


170
0:9:20,76 --> 0:9:22,8
No, she had a baby.


171
0:9:22,8 --> 0:9:25,16
Why don't you be Philippa
and I'll be me ?


172
0:9:25,16 --> 0:9:26,8
- You what ?
- Interview me.


173
0:9:26,8 --> 0:9:30,12
OK. Er, that's very interesting.


174
0:9:30,12 --> 0:9:31,96
No, do it properly.


175
0:9:31,96 --> 0:9:33,84
OK.


176
0:9:33,84 --> 0:9:38,56
This is a very large machine,
Tim. Take you long ?


177
0:9:38,56 --> 0:9:40,44
No, not really.


178
0:9:40,44 --> 0:9:42,32
Fast worker.


179
0:9:42,32 --> 0:9:45,36
Why don't you come back to my
flat and we'll find out ?


180
0:9:45,36 --> 0:9:49,4
I think you've already
answered my question.


181
0:9:49,4 --> 0:9:51,84
- So you like my robot, then ?
- I love it.


182
0:9:51,84 --> 0:9:53,16
What's this ?


183
0:9:53,16 --> 0:9:57,88
That's an axe. Feel the weight.


184
0:9:57,88 --> 0:10:1,8
There's nothing more devastating
than a big chopper.


185
0:10:1,8 --> 0:10:4,88
Shh !


186
0:10:4,88 --> 0:10:8,72
Don't cheapen this.


187
0:10:8,72 --> 0:10:9,96
What is going on ?


188
0:10:9,96 --> 0:10:12,2
I was just... coming
to the pub with you.


189
0:10:12,2 --> 0:10:16,6
Yeah. Think we should take
the private down to the shed.


190
0:10:16,6 --> 0:10:20,24
- What's up with Mike ?
- Nothing. He likes to be Philippa.


191
0:10:20,24 --> 0:10:46,8
Good night, little one.
I'll see you in the morning.


192
0:10:46,8 --> 0:10:49,68
Look at you there,
so pretty and proud.


193
0:10:49,68 --> 0:10:50,96
Take that !


194
0:10:50,96 --> 0:10:53,8
You think you're better than me !


195
0:10:53,8 --> 0:10:54,92
You're no better than Big Trak.


196
0:10:54,92 --> 0:10:56,44
You will never go to combat.


197
0:10:56,44 --> 0:11:7,6
You will never be in Robot Wars !


198
0:11:7,6 --> 0:11:10,4
Oh, shit.


199
0:11:10,4 --> 0:11:11,92
It's true.


200
0:11:11,92 --> 0:11:14,0
- She sacked her for that ?
- Yeah.


201
0:11:14,0 --> 0:11:17,96
- What a bitch.
- Hee.


202
0:11:17,96 --> 0:11:22,24
Ooh, look at me. I'm Tina.
I've got the locker keys.


203
0:11:22,24 --> 0:11:23,84
What is going on ?


204
0:11:23,84 --> 0:11:26,2
- Nothing.
- Really ?


205
0:11:26,2 --> 0:11:31,4
Well, I've decided
to change the duty roster.


206
0:11:31,4 --> 0:11:38,28
You'll be downstairs today.
Follow me.


207
0:11:38,28 --> 0:11:39,52
Take these.


208
0:11:39,52 --> 0:11:41,68
It'll...


209
0:11:41,68 --> 0:11:54,76
m-m-make it easier.


210
0:11:54,76 --> 0:11:58,56
This is Harris.


211
0:11:58,56 --> 0:12:9,2
He'll show you the ropes.


212
0:12:9,2 --> 0:12:20,68
Haven't seen you upstairs.


213
0:12:20,68 --> 0:12:22,92
Oh, shit !


214
0:12:22,92 --> 0:12:35,76
That's exactly what I said.


215
0:12:35,76 --> 0:12:37,48
- Brian !
- Marty.


216
0:12:37,48 --> 0:12:39,68
Good to see you.
Thanks for doing this.


217
0:12:39,68 --> 0:12:43,8
- Actually...
- Hope it meets your requirements.


218
0:12:43,8 --> 0:12:44,56
I don't...


219
0:12:44,56 --> 0:12:46,68
I'm popping out. You'll be all right ?


220
0:12:46,68 --> 0:12:48,84
Ah, well, that's...


221
0:12:48,84 --> 0:12:51,8
It's 10 am now. Exhibition
starts at 6:30 pm.


222
0:12:51,8 --> 0:12:53,52
Any problems, here's my mobile.


223
0:12:53,52 --> 0:12:55,32
- I can't...
- There we go.


224
0:12:55,32 --> 0:12:57,72
Good luck with the getting.


225
0:12:57,72 --> 0:13:1,56
Can't wait to see
what you've come up with.


226
0:13:1,56 --> 0:13:5,16
Natasha.


227
0:13:5,16 --> 0:13:8,8
- Who would do such a thing ?
- I think I can guess.


228
0:13:8,8 --> 0:13:11,64
No random hit.
It's been taken apart by someone


229
0:13:11,64 --> 0:13:14,32
- who knows what they're doing.
- What happens now ?


230
0:13:14,32 --> 0:13:16,84
If we don't repair him
the runners-up go through.


231
0:13:16,84 --> 0:13:18,24
Who's that ?


232
0:13:18,24 --> 0:13:24,0
- Dexter and Cromwell.
- Exactly.


233
0:13:24,0 --> 0:13:25,88
- Who did this ?
- They did !


234
0:13:25,88 --> 0:13:27,6
- They wouldn't.
- They would.


235
0:13:27,6 --> 0:13:30,8
- We're screwed.
- We can't give up.


236
0:13:30,8 --> 0:13:31,8
We're never gonna fix him now.


237
0:13:31,8 --> 0:13:33,64
- Yes we will.
- How ?


238
0:13:33,64 --> 0:13:36,8
We'll find a way.
We'll use every contact.


239
0:13:36,8 --> 0:13:39,84
We'll pull every favour,
work every hour.


240
0:13:39,84 --> 0:13:43,16
We're gonna fix him and then
we're gonna kick some ass.


241
0:13:43,16 --> 0:13:48,84
Timmy, fetch me my tools.


242
0:13:48,84 --> 0:13:53,4
Mike, what about the show ?


243
0:13:53,4 --> 0:16:15,32
The show's over.


244
0:16:15,32 --> 0:16:16,52
Shit.


245
0:16:16,52 --> 0:16:20,4
Not right.


246
0:16:20,4 --> 0:16:22,92
Shit !


247
0:16:22,92 --> 0:16:24,56
Shit !


248
0:16:24,56 --> 0:16:46,6
I just need something else.


249
0:16:46,6 --> 0:16:48,4
- All done ?
- Yeah.


250
0:16:48,4 --> 0:16:50,32
Would you mind staying on tonight ?


251
0:16:50,32 --> 0:16:52,72
- But I...
- Josey has called in sick.


252
0:16:52,72 --> 0:16:55,0
You wouldn't want
to leave me in the lurch.


253
0:16:55,0 --> 0:16:57,28
So mop the floor
and take out the bin.


254
0:16:57,28 --> 0:16:59,32
- I can't do this.
- Excuse me ?


255
0:16:59,32 --> 0:17:2,12
- I'm sick of it.
- Who do you think you are ?


256
0:17:2,12 --> 0:17:6,4
I'm a writer, right ?
I'm creative.


257
0:17:6,4 --> 0:17:8,68
I'm not a... mopper.


258
0:17:8,68 --> 0:17:10,36
They're all writers, Daisy.


259
0:17:10,36 --> 0:17:13,6
- What ?
- All the staff here are writers.


260
0:17:13,6 --> 0:17:17,12
- Not Harris.
- Haikus, I believe.


261
0:17:17,12 --> 0:17:20,4
Charlie's an actor,
but he's writing some play.


262
0:17:20,4 --> 0:17:23,44
- Even Billy ?
- Even Billy.


263
0:17:23,44 --> 0:17:26,68
l-I was published in '97.


264
0:17:26,68 --> 0:17:29,24
It w-w-was just a short story.


265
0:17:29,24 --> 0:17:34,6
I... I... I came here in '98.


266
0:17:34,6 --> 0:17:39,56
They're all creative, Daisy.
Not just you.


267
0:17:39,56 --> 0:17:46,36
Now, get creative with this.


268
0:17:46,36 --> 0:17:51,8
Their robot !


269
0:17:51,8 --> 0:17:54,32
- Hello, boys.
- Michael, hi.


270
0:17:54,32 --> 0:17:58,64
Look, sorry to hear about
your robot. Crying shame, that.


271
0:17:58,64 --> 0:18:2,4
What do you mean, crying shame ?
You did it, you fucking plum.


272
0:18:2,4 --> 0:18:6,44
Well, whoever did it is academic now.


273
0:18:6,44 --> 0:18:8,24
You don't have a robot


274
0:18:8,24 --> 0:18:12,8
and we do, ergo we get to go
on Robot Wars and you don't.


275
0:18:12,8 --> 0:18:13,64
Is that so ?


276
0:18:13,64 --> 0:18:21,56
You want a re-match ?


277
0:18:21,56 --> 0:18:23,28
You got one.


278
0:18:23,28 --> 0:18:26,16
Where ?


279
0:18:26,16 --> 0:18:29,88
You know where.


280
0:18:29,88 --> 0:18:32,76
Gentlemen,
welcome to Robot Club.


281
0:18:32,76 --> 0:18:37,4
The first rule of Robot Club is...


282
0:18:37,4 --> 0:18:40,0
you do not talk about Robot Club.


283
0:18:40,0 --> 0:18:45,92
The second rule of Robot Club is
you do not talk about Rob...


284
0:18:45,92 --> 0:18:52,64
Wait, I got that wrong.


285
0:18:52,64 --> 0:18:55,48
The second rule is no smoking.


286
0:18:55,48 --> 0:18:58,4
- Why can't we smoke ?
- Shh. We can't talk about it.


287
0:18:58,4 --> 0:18:59,52
All right.


288
0:18:59,52 --> 0:19:1,4
First battle...


289
0:19:1,4 --> 0:19:16,4
Blue Thunder versus Metallicock.
Activate !


290
0:19:16,4 --> 0:19:20,52
Hello. I've seen you here
before, haven't I ?


291
0:19:20,52 --> 0:19:22,64
Always nice to meet an art lover.


292
0:19:22,64 --> 0:19:24,88
Actually I'm just here
for the free booze.


293
0:19:24,88 --> 0:19:26,92
Free booze, great.


294
0:19:26,92 --> 0:19:29,4
I'm Marty Berghaus.
I own the gallery.


295
0:19:29,4 --> 0:19:31,12
- Oh, cheers.
- Cheers.


296
0:19:31,12 --> 0:19:33,28
I'm Marsha Klein.


297
0:19:33,28 --> 0:19:36,6
So, Marsha, are you enjoying
the installation ?


298
0:19:36,6 --> 0:19:38,24
Oh, yeah.


299
0:19:38,24 --> 0:19:40,2
- Very moving.
- Hmm.


300
0:19:40,2 --> 0:19:43,0
Yes, certainly has something,
doesn't it ?


301
0:19:43,0 --> 0:19:47,8
Loneliness, isolation.


302
0:19:47,8 --> 0:19:49,12
Insecurity.


303
0:19:49,12 --> 0:19:57,52
That's our Brian.


304
0:19:57,52 --> 0:19:58,92
Cease !


305
0:19:58,92 --> 0:20:2,32
Now for the battle royale -


306
0:20:2,32 --> 0:20:8,92
Private Iron versus War Bastard.


307
0:20:8,92 --> 0:20:17,48
Activate !


308
0:20:17,48 --> 0:20:32,2
Come on !


309
0:20:32,2 --> 0:20:35,8
Come on !


310
0:20:35,8 --> 0:20:45,16
Come on !


311
0:20:45,16 --> 0:20:52,56
Cromwell.


312
0:20:52,56 --> 0:20:55,4
- What happened ?
- They've blown the motor.


313
0:20:55,4 --> 0:20:56,8
That's not fair !


314
0:20:56,8 --> 0:20:59,96
- That's not fair !
- That's not fair !


315
0:20:59,96 --> 0:21:3,96
Welcome to the real world,
Michael. It's not a fair place.


316
0:21:3,96 --> 0:21:8,44
Prepare to be annihilated.


317
0:21:8,44 --> 0:21:10,72
It's time we brought out
the big guns.


318
0:21:10,72 --> 0:21:20,24
I think you're right.


319
0:21:20,24 --> 0:21:21,92
- Nice touch.
- Thank you.


320
0:21:21,92 --> 0:21:24,44
That's not fair.


321
0:21:24,44 --> 0:21:31,88
That's not fair !
That's not fair !


322
0:21:31,88 --> 0:21:43,56
Aahhhh !


323
0:21:43,56 --> 0:21:46,72
Cease !


324
0:21:46,72 --> 0:21:49,52
Brian, what can I say ?


325
0:21:49,52 --> 0:21:52,56
Well done. I'm amazed you
lay there for the duration.


326
0:21:52,56 --> 0:21:56,4
At least Tilda Swinton
was comfortable.


327
0:21:56,4 --> 0:22:1,28
Great work. Listen, pop by next week.
We can talk about a residency.


328
0:22:1,28 --> 0:22:2,96
OK.


329
0:22:2,96 --> 0:22:4,96
Great. I'd better call it a day.


330
0:22:4,96 --> 0:22:7,72
- Where are you off to now ?
- Hospital.


331
0:22:7,72 --> 0:22:12,6
Ah, one of Damien's
trendy new bars, no doubt.


332
0:22:12,6 --> 0:22:16,0
Oh well, catch you next week.


333
0:22:16,0 --> 0:22:21,12
There you go, Bri.
You was a knockout.


334
0:22:21,12 --> 0:22:22,68
What you laughing for ?


335
0:22:22,68 --> 0:22:26,96
I don't know.


336
0:22:26,96 --> 0:22:28,8
Come on, Daisy.


337
0:22:28,8 --> 0:22:30,8
Put your back into it.


338
0:22:30,8 --> 0:22:33,92
Come on, you can do
better than that.


339
0:22:33,92 --> 0:22:36,92
Stop gawping, you retards.


340
0:22:36,92 --> 0:22:39,28
That's it ! That is it.


341
0:22:39,28 --> 0:22:41,52
- I'm not doing this.
- You've got no choice.


342
0:22:41,52 --> 0:22:43,16
You're not the boss of me !


343
0:22:43,16 --> 0:22:45,36
- Yes I am.
- You are technically,


344
0:22:45,36 --> 0:22:47,4
but you're not better than me.


345
0:22:47,4 --> 0:22:52,76
I don't know what kick you get
out of being such a bitch...


346
0:22:52,76 --> 0:22:54,52
...but I'm not
helping you get it.


347
0:22:54,52 --> 0:22:58,0
These are good people. They're
artists. They deserve respect.


348
0:22:58,0 --> 0:23:0,56
Come on, there's thousands of
ways to make money,


349
0:23:0,56 --> 0:23:2,36
it doesn't have to be like this.


350
0:23:2,36 --> 0:23:6,44
We can walk out with our heads high,
show this bitch...


351
0:23:6,44 --> 0:23:8,44
...that we don't need her.


352
0:23:8,44 --> 0:23:11,96
She needs us and
it's about time she realised it.


353
0:23:11,96 --> 0:23:14,88
Now, who's with me ?


354
0:23:14,88 --> 0:23:23,0
Who's with me ?


355
0:23:23,0 --> 0:23:42,6
Anybody ?


356
0:23:42,6 --> 0:23:44,96
- Thank you.
- Interesting night ?


357
0:23:44,96 --> 0:23:47,32
No more than usual.


358
0:23:47,32 --> 0:24:2,28
Cheers, boys.


359
0:24:2,28 --> 0:26:2,28
- Juicy Fruit ?
- No, thanks.
