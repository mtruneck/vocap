1
0:0:0,6 --> 0:0:4,569
i was repelled by what had been newtown
as you can tell by the dozens of videos


2
0:0:4,569 --> 0:0:8,88
that i made about it and everytime i'd
say about the video we showed you with


3
0:0:8,88 --> 0:0:10,0
the kids in them


4
0:0:10,0 --> 0:0:12,669
when the baseball had


5
0:0:12,669 --> 0:0:14,31
parent crying


6
0:0:14,31 --> 0:0:15,85
part about how


7
0:0:15,85 --> 0:0:16,86
his daughter


8
0:0:16,86 --> 0:0:17,859
lit up the room


9
0:0:17,859 --> 0:0:21,19
uh... i have a hard time cuban at the
end


10
0:0:21,19 --> 0:0:23,32
but what's interesting is that


11
0:0:23,32 --> 0:0:26,23
when i a drone strikes


12
0:0:26,23 --> 0:0:28,479
kids that are not american


13
0:0:28,479 --> 0:0:30,589
and gets almost no coverage


14
0:0:30,589 --> 0:0:32,959
and people are not broken about about it


15
0:0:32,959 --> 0:0:35,0
then the president who was teary eyed
about


16
0:0:35,0 --> 0:0:38,96
new town which is exactly what he should
have been when you you've got a control


17
0:0:38,96 --> 0:0:40,5
on that


18
0:0:40,5 --> 0:0:42,79
uh... is not teary-eyed about


19
0:0:42,79 --> 0:0:44,55
civilian casualties


20
0:0:44,55 --> 0:0:47,16
throughout strikes


21
0:0:47,16 --> 0:0:51,87
the reason we have all machala out they
risk is is a town in southern yemen


22
0:0:51,87 --> 0:0:52,859
and uh...


23
0:0:52,859 --> 0:0:56,4
we actually the tomahawk missile strikes
there


24
0:0:56,4 --> 0:0:59,1
and there is also cluster bombs as well


25
0:0:59,1 --> 0:1:5,2
and we killed fourteen women and twenty
one children


26
0:1:5,2 --> 0:1:6,69
twenty one children


27
0:1:6,69 --> 0:1:10,4
now newtown there was twenty kids killed
twenty eight overall


28
0:1:10,4 --> 0:1:13,659
now of course the u_s_ says that's all
incredibly different because we're


29
0:1:13,659 --> 0:1:15,74
trying to target militants


30
0:1:15,74 --> 0:1:18,1
in which are in any milton cements right


31
0:1:18,1 --> 0:1:20,82
well it's unclear when there is
reporting


32
0:1:20,82 --> 0:1:22,37
bhaiyya many journalists


33
0:1:22,37 --> 0:1:26,11
and prepare that said and that showed
the bombs were from the u_s_


34
0:1:26,11 --> 0:1:27,7
and they show the civilian deaths


35
0:1:27,7 --> 0:1:30,78
so what happened the journalists to show
the civilian deaths


36
0:1:30,78 --> 0:1:33,26
he was put in prison by the government
yemen


37
0:1:33,26 --> 0:1:35,71
uh... they will let him out


38
0:1:35,71 --> 0:1:36,719
cub leaders later


39
0:1:36,719 --> 0:1:39,759
there were a pardon soleil who's no
longer president him it was going to do


40
0:1:39,759 --> 0:1:40,29
it


41
0:1:40,29 --> 0:1:43,77
this is a journalist than it was obvious
and the people yemen were upset


42
0:1:43,77 --> 0:1:46,4
but he was put in jail uh... for


43
0:1:46,4 --> 0:1:47,92
covering the civilian deaths


44
0:1:47,92 --> 0:1:49,78
present nobama called


45
0:1:49,78 --> 0:1:51,35
and said no


46
0:1:51,35 --> 0:1:55,49
the u_s_ government still calls at your
list of terrorist


47
0:1:55,49 --> 0:1:57,959
do not give mum pardoned put him back in
jail and they did


48
0:1:57,959 --> 0:1:59,99
and he still in jail today


49
0:1:59,99 --> 0:2:1,92
vice-president while made that call


50
0:2:1,92 --> 0:2:4,85
why 'cause we don't want the world


51
0:2:4,85 --> 0:2:6,14
to see the kids


52
0:2:6,14 --> 0:2:8,469
that died because of or box


53
0:2:8,469 --> 0:2:12,939
now i know a lot of people think there's
justified in collateral damage


54
0:2:12,939 --> 0:2:15,26
but at least see the kids first


55
0:2:15,26 --> 0:2:17,659
as we didn't in the newtown massacre


56
0:2:17,659 --> 0:2:20,99
before you make that decision


57
0:2:20,99 --> 0:2:23,149
now brave new foundation went


58
0:2:23,149 --> 0:2:27,26
talk to people on the ground where the
straw strikes happen


59
0:2:27,26 --> 0:2:29,389
lot of these victims are from


60
0:2:29,389 --> 0:2:30,639
pakistan


61
0:2:30,639 --> 0:2:33,369
yemen somalia it's ever been not or from


62
0:2:33,369 --> 0:2:35,279
all majali in fact all machala


63
0:2:35,279 --> 0:2:38,359
as i told you was a tomahawk cruise
missile strike


64
0:2:38,359 --> 0:2:39,28
but look at


65
0:2:39,28 --> 0:2:41,639
the different rose strikes


66
0:2:41,639 --> 0:2:56,629
killed those kids throughout the world


67
0:2:56,629 --> 0:2:57,78
myself am


68
0:2:57,78 --> 0:2:58,829
three-years-old


69
0:2:58,829 --> 0:3:0,429
solace listed his fans


70
0:3:0,429 --> 0:3:1,819
generates pancake carries


71
0:3:1,819 --> 0:3:3,479
two thousand seven


72
0:3:3,479 --> 0:3:5,979
no-risk cited in years old


73
0:3:5,979 --> 0:3:7,38
selfless there's time


74
0:3:7,38 --> 0:3:11,64
february fourteen to four months for
cited references that we have to last


75
0:3:11,64 --> 0:3:15,12
ten years old not take their standard
counter-terrorism efforts has been


76
0:3:15,12 --> 0:3:18,63
exceptionally circle an exceptionally
target areas because he has been very


77
0:3:18,63 --> 0:3:19,629
precise


78
0:3:19,629 --> 0:3:22,5
precision strikes against off at that
time


79
0:3:22,5 --> 0:3:23,78
no it was a response


80
0:3:23,78 --> 0:3:28,2
u_s_ officials to thrones are highly
actors want to start seven-year zones


81
0:3:28,2 --> 0:3:32,3
have not caused a huge number of
civilian casualties sha three years old


82
0:3:32,3 --> 0:3:36,28
you're able to target and smuts more
precision dot times all the actions that


83
0:3:36,28 --> 0:3:40,25
we take his fully consistent with
international loans from the past here


84
0:3:40,25 --> 0:3:44,72
that has invented a single collateral
death orphans of his money managers to


85
0:3:44,72 --> 0:3:49,239
make a lot but life is really war really
have a very colorful about


86
0:3:49,239 --> 0:3:54,559
from boarding civilian casualty


87
0:3:54,559 --> 0:3:56,119
so when we say that


88
0:3:56,119 --> 0:3:58,439
the kids were not killed in the news


89
0:3:58,439 --> 0:4:1,979
no civilian tags please we are
indisputably line


90
0:4:1,979 --> 0:4:2,919
based on


91
0:4:2,919 --> 0:4:4,79
reporting


92
0:4:4,79 --> 0:4:8,39
based on international groups that have
gone on the ground and seen


93
0:4:8,39 --> 0:4:12,109
the dead kids the you just saw


94
0:4:12,109 --> 0:4:13,269
if that doesn't


95
0:4:13,269 --> 0:4:15,209
also cause you


96
0:4:15,209 --> 0:4:20,4
to think hate me he would do something
long there as well


97
0:4:20,4 --> 0:4:24,589
act you got a question yourself on that


98
0:4:24,589 --> 0:4:26,52
now the thing is


99
0:4:26,52 --> 0:4:29,529
as you dipping will be doing this


100
0:4:29,529 --> 0:4:32,89
are also have concerts 'cause they've
seen it


101
0:4:32,89 --> 0:4:36,46
one particular guy is brenda brian
hughes a u_s_ strong pilot


102
0:4:36,46 --> 0:4:39,37
and equip because uh... he was


103
0:4:39,37 --> 0:4:42,2
racked with guilt over killing civilians


104
0:4:42,2 --> 0:4:46,39
now the u_s_ media of course has not
cover that story almost at all


105
0:4:46,39 --> 0:4:48,639
there should be going for many did you
talk to


106
0:4:48,639 --> 0:4:52,529
and here's how he explains one
particular instance they say bryan in


107
0:4:52,529 --> 0:4:56,46
his co-workers sat in for a fourteen
computer monitors and four keyboards


108
0:4:56,46 --> 0:5:0,439
when brian press the button in new
mexico someone died on the other side of


109
0:5:0,439 --> 0:5:1,88
the world


110
0:5:1,88 --> 0:5:6,24
he remembers one incident very clearly
when a predator john was circling a


111
0:5:6,24 --> 0:5:11,19
figure a pattern in the sky above
afghanistan


112
0:5:11,19 --> 0:5:14,679
the article explains it was a countdown
and neice heat


113
0:5:14,679 --> 0:5:19,51
bryant's job was to focuses the laser on
where the drone was going to go


114
0:5:19,51 --> 0:5:21,27
and a guy sitting next to him


115
0:5:21,27 --> 0:5:22,479
pushes the but


116
0:5:22,479 --> 0:5:26,36
but he can move the laser and if he does
the bond those elsewhere


117
0:5:26,36 --> 0:5:31,139
and is a countdown happening in ec he's
seen go to seventeen seconds in the


118
0:5:31,139 --> 0:5:32,6
bench leaves you about the sea


119
0:5:32,6 --> 0:5:34,6
seven seconds


120
0:5:34,6 --> 0:5:36,75
any sinking down i don't know who's in
there i hope they got the right


121
0:5:36,75 --> 0:5:37,84
information


122
0:5:37,84 --> 0:5:40,0
and the their spiegel picks it up from
there


123
0:5:40,0 --> 0:5:42,2
was seven seconds left the dell


124
0:5:42,2 --> 0:5:44,94
there was no one to be seen on the
ground brian could still have diverted


125
0:5:44,94 --> 0:5:48,85
the missile at that point that it was
down to three seconds by felt as if he


126
0:5:48,85 --> 0:5:52,279
had to count each individual pixel on
the monitor


127
0:5:52,279 --> 0:5:59,8
suddenly the child walk around the
corner recess


128
0:5:59,8 --> 0:6:1,679
the story then continues


129
0:6:1,679 --> 0:6:6,29
second zero was the moment in which
bryant's digital world collided with the


130
0:6:6,29 --> 0:6:7,189
real one


131
0:6:7,189 --> 0:6:9,129
in a village between bob louden


132
0:6:9,129 --> 0:6:12,289
and mosser he sure re


133
0:6:12,289 --> 0:6:14,56
bryant saw flash on the screen


134
0:6:14,56 --> 0:6:16,19
the explosion


135
0:6:16,19 --> 0:6:17,969
parts of the building collapsed


136
0:6:17,969 --> 0:6:19,919
the child had disappeared


137
0:6:19,919 --> 0:6:22,629
brian sick feeling in his stomach


138
0:6:22,629 --> 0:6:25,309
burma this is one of our drome parts


139
0:6:25,309 --> 0:6:26,729
and he says


140
0:6:26,729 --> 0:6:28,34
did we just kill a kid


141
0:6:28,34 --> 0:6:31,2
he asked the man sitting next to him


142
0:6:31,2 --> 0:6:33,369
and the man who pushed the button says
yeah


143
0:6:33,369 --> 0:6:38,69
i guess that was a kid the pilot replied


144
0:6:38,69 --> 0:6:43,8
so they asked was that a kidney road in
the chat window on the monitor


145
0:6:43,8 --> 0:6:46,719
their shingle continues this someone
they didn't know answer


146
0:6:46,719 --> 0:6:50,269
someone sitting in the military command
center somewhere in the world could


147
0:6:50,269 --> 0:6:52,89
observe their attack


148
0:6:52,89 --> 0:6:56,61
no so that was a dog a personal


149
0:6:56,61 --> 0:6:57,61
they went back


150
0:6:57,61 --> 0:7:2,2
ang be reviewed the scene on the video


151
0:7:2,2 --> 0:7:3,0
and dog


152
0:7:3,0 --> 0:7:8,259
on two legs


153
0:7:8,259 --> 0:7:11,549
so when they tell you we don't kill
civilians


154
0:7:11,549 --> 0:7:13,86
and you know they're lying because


155
0:7:13,86 --> 0:7:17,849
recently they reclassified every


156
0:7:17,849 --> 0:7:20,19
military age now


157
0:7:20,19 --> 0:7:23,239
and by the way there now including
children in that two we did that story


158
0:7:23,239 --> 0:7:25,99
as well


159
0:7:25,99 --> 0:7:27,4
as young as eight years old


160
0:7:27,4 --> 0:7:28,549
is saying


161
0:7:28,549 --> 0:7:29,8
by definition


162
0:7:29,8 --> 0:7:30,81
there now


163
0:7:30,81 --> 0:7:32,999
all considered militants


164
0:7:32,999 --> 0:7:34,28
if we killed them


165
0:7:34,28 --> 0:7:35,74
you have to prove


166
0:7:35,74 --> 0:7:37,18
that they were innocent


167
0:7:37,18 --> 0:7:38,139
otherwise


168
0:7:38,139 --> 0:7:40,579
we assume they were militants


169
0:7:40,579 --> 0:7:43,999
that they did that to our kids what
would we think


170
0:7:43,999 --> 0:7:48,99
look at what happened in newtown and how
devastated we work


171
0:7:48,99 --> 0:7:52,83
and ever seen anything practice areas
had devastating the figure minutes


172
0:7:52,83 --> 0:7:56,27
and all these places were were due intro
strike every pros right


173
0:7:56,27 --> 0:7:57,729
and then


174
0:7:57,729 --> 0:8:1,129
adding insult to injury we call the kids
dogs


175
0:8:1,129 --> 0:8:4,449
because we couldn't possibly make a
mistake


176
0:8:4,449 --> 0:8:8,77
glenn greenwald made a good point about
this is part of the dehumanizing amo of


177
0:8:8,77 --> 0:8:10,65
muslims across the world


178
0:8:10,65 --> 0:8:12,83
this is hard to kill kids


179
0:8:12,83 --> 0:8:16,33
it's hard to live with that is bryan
found that he couldn't live with it


180
0:8:16,33 --> 0:8:19,479
and so he moved on any quit that job


181
0:8:19,479 --> 0:8:21,79
so what do we do now and i know


182
0:8:21,79 --> 0:8:24,259
they're not kids they're militants


183
0:8:24,259 --> 0:8:25,229
and if it looks on


184
0:8:25,229 --> 0:8:26,809
camel like their kid


185
0:8:26,809 --> 0:8:30,869
we're going to calm a dog


186
0:8:30,869 --> 0:8:34,35
if those kids don't also affect you


187
0:8:34,35 --> 0:8:36,93
i think you got a question yourself man


188
0:8:36,93 --> 0:8:39,54
i'm ripped apart by what happened
newtown


189
0:8:39,54 --> 0:8:41,48
masa ripped apart by what happened on


190
0:8:41,48 --> 0:8:42,83
in almond jhala


191
0:8:42,83 --> 0:8:44,15
and so many different


192
0:8:44,15 --> 0:8:46,82
cities across pakistan yemen


193
0:8:46,82 --> 0:10:46,82
and other countries that we do draw
strict
