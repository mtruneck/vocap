Polystrate fossils refute deep time,
responding to the bizarre assertion to


2
0:0:5,94 --> 0:0:10,84
that biogenesis doesn't apply to ancient
times, and of course we dive into the


3

0:0:28,85 --> 0:0:33,6
And a welcome to this episode of Genesis
Week, the weekly program of creationary


6
0:0:33,6 --> 0:0:37,97
commentary on news, views and events
pertaining to the origins controversy,


7
0:0:37,97 --> 0:0:43,37
made possible by the supporters of CORE
Ottawa - Citizens for Origins Research


8
0:0:43,37 --> 0:0:48,17
and Education, and exclusive right here
on youtube.  Pirate broadcasting from


9
0:0:48,17 --> 0:0:52,68
Tracy Island, we show the glory of God in
Creation and bring you the information


10
0:0:52,68 --> 0:0:57,3
the anti-creationists don't want you to see
or hear.  One of the most talked about


11
0:0:57,3 --> 0:0:59,39
shows in Science and Technology on
youtube.

15
0:1:12,46 --> 0:1:15,12
your host, Ian Juby


16
0:1:15,12 --> 0:1:21,8
A spectacular find of a fossil forest in
China has garnered some interest.  Buried


17
0:1:21,8 --> 0:1:26,36
in volcanic ash, these trees were
apparently buried in-situ, that is, buried


18
0:1:26,36 --> 0:1:31,82
upright, right where they grew.  While I
have no problem with the idea of in-situ


19
0:1:31,82 --> 0:1:37,46
burial, so far every time I have
investigated claims of "in-situ burial," the


20
0:1:37,46 --> 0:1:42,39
claims didn't hold up.  This could be a
first, simply because of the description of


21
0:1:42,39 --> 0:1:47,26
the site.  Fossil trees buried and preserved
upright in the fossil record are quite


22
0:1:47,26 --> 0:1:51,14
common - I've personally studied such
finds In New Brunswick, Nova Scotia,


23
0:1:51,14 --> 0:1:55,45
Alberta and British Columbia, Yellowstone
National park, Tennessee, Pennsylvania,


24
0:1:55,45 --> 0:2:0,64
Colorado and New Mexico.  Such fossils
which are buried vertically in the rock are


25
0:2:0,64 --> 0:2:6,63
called polystrate - poly for many, strate
for the strata of rock that the fossil cuts


26
0:2:6,63 --> 0:2:10,48
through.
most of the Chinese fossil trees are not


27
0:2:10,48 --> 0:2:16,24
trees at all, but rather giant, hollow reeds,
the same kind of plants as those found at


28
0:2:16,24 --> 0:2:21,94
Joggins, Nova Scotia.  
Rock layers are alleged to have taken at


29
0:2:21,94 --> 0:2:27,36
least thousands, perhaps millions of
years to accumulate.  But then we find


30
0:2:27,36 --> 0:2:32,33
polystrate fossils cutting through such
layers - well, those trunks won't remain in


31
0:2:32,33 --> 0:2:35,91
place for tens of years, let alone
thousands, or millions.


32
0:2:35,91 --> 0:2:41,44
Yet that is precisely what we are expected
to believe: When one reads the literature


33
0:2:41,44 --> 0:2:45,69
available at the Joggins Fossil Center, or
the Museum of Nova Scotia website, they


34
0:2:45,69 --> 0:2:47,67
couldn't be more clear.


35
0:2:47,67 --> 0:2:56,61
On the Joggins Fossil Cliffs Visitor's
center website, we read:  


36
0:2:56,61 --> 0:3:0,51
We also see a story drawn in Laing
Ferguson's book from the museum of


37
0:3:0,51 --> 0:3:5,73
Nova Scotia, and at the Joggins visitor's
center, painting a clear picture of gradual


38
0:3:5,73 --> 0:3:10,7
burial over time.
The Chinese fossil plants are all buried in


39
0:3:10,7 --> 0:3:15,58
a layer just 66 centimeters thick,
uncovered in a coal mine.  There were


40
0:3:15,58 --> 0:3:20,19
some trunks that were reported
suspended in the rock on an angle - not


41
0:3:20,19 --> 0:3:25,3
straight up and down - almost as if the
trunk was buried while fallling! Of course,


42
0:3:25,3 --> 0:3:31,1
we also see this at Joggins and elsewhere
as well. Clearly these layers did not take


43
0:3:31,1 --> 0:3:33,88
thousands or millions of years to
accumulate.


44
0:3:33,88 --> 0:3:57,84
On the Museum of Nova Scotia website,
we read:


45
0:3:57,84 --> 0:4:26,74
We also read on the Museum of Nova
Scotia Website:


46
0:4:26,74 --> 0:4:33,68
Yet we find some stumps buried
polystrate through coal seams! And


47
0:4:33,68 --> 0:4:37,84
sometimes coal seams are a mere quarter
inch thick - were they quarter inch deep


48
0:4:37,84 --> 0:4:43,75
swamps?  The Chinese find was also
found in a coal mine, allegedly a peat bog.


49
0:4:43,75 --> 0:4:48,84
Obviously, there are huge problems with
the conventional interpretation of time


50
0:4:48,84 --> 0:4:53,64
and the origin of coal.
There's also a problem with the "in situ"


51
0:4:53,64 --> 0:4:57,53
interpretation of the stumps - for
example, some stumps of polystrates


52
0:4:57,53 --> 0:5:2,36
have their roots sheered off, while other
roots have had their rootlets stripped off -


53
0:5:2,36 --> 0:5:6,75
clear evidence that the plants have been
uprooted, then buried elsewhere in an


54
0:5:6,75 --> 0:5:11,61
upright position.  Some of the stumps are
upside down.  


55
0:5:11,61 --> 0:5:15,51
Now I proved just how lousy a gardener I
was when all of my plants commited


56
0:5:15,51 --> 0:5:20,83
suicide, however, one thing I did NOT do
wrong, was try to grow my plants upside


57
0:5:20,83 --> 0:5:26,53
down.  Last I checked, plants don't grow
well at all upside down and underground.


58
0:5:26,53 --> 0:5:31,19
While studying dinosaur tracks at a coal
mine in Alberta with a young geologist, I


59
0:5:31,19 --> 0:5:36,68
noted a most unusual phenomena:
dozens of upside down, polystrate


60
0:5:36,68 --> 0:5:43,76
stumps from a giant, hollow reed like the
lycopods of Joggins.  The roots went into


61
0:5:43,76 --> 0:5:49,73
the coal which was on top of the dinosaur
tracks.  Obviously, the coal, the dinosaur


62
0:5:49,73 --> 0:5:56,7
tracks, and the layers the dinosaur tracks
are in that the trunks cut through, were all


63
0:5:56,7 --> 0:6:1,6
laid down RAPIDLY. There is no
thousands or milliions of years here, the


64
0:6:1,6 --> 0:6:6,48
conventional interpretations used to prop
up the ideas of an old earth collapse upon


65
0:6:6,48 --> 0:6:11,99
scientific investigation.  All of these facts,
however, can fit in well within a global


66
0:6:11,99 --> 0:6:15,65
catastrophe like Noah's flood.


67
0:6:15,65 --> 0:6:19,72
With all of my talk both on this program
and in my CrEvo rants that evolution must


68
0:6:19,72 --> 0:6:23,83
violate the scientific and natural law of
biogenesis, TheScienceFoundation has


69
0:6:23,83 --> 0:6:29,57
repeatedly tried to "educate me"  by
claiming that Louis Pasteur actually


70
0:6:29,57 --> 0:6:34,18
disproved a form of creationism and that
the law of biogenesis only applies to


71
0:6:34,18 --> 0:6:37,92
modern life. [Pasteur: HUH?"]
 It's obvious he got this idea from Mark


72
0:6:37,92 --> 0:7:0,51
Isaak's page on talk.organs, which says:


73
0:7:0,51 --> 0:7:4,23
Now if your brain just locked up, don't
worry - this is a common side effect from


74
0:7:4,23 --> 0:7:7,51
trying to understand illogical arguments.


75
0:7:7,51 --> 0:7:31,17
To be clear on the matter, let us hear the
words of Pasteur himself on the subject:


76
0:7:31,17 --> 0:7:35,88
Pasteur was precisely refuting the idea
that increasingly complex molecules


77
0:7:35,88 --> 0:7:40,82
could form primitive life.  Apparently Isaak
and TheScienceFoundation are hoping


78
0:7:40,82 --> 0:7:45,45
the laws of physics and nature were
DIFFERENT in the past.  That's wonderful


79
0:7:45,45 --> 0:7:51,29
to speculate, but the onus is upon you
folks for demonstrating that life can form


80
0:7:51,29 --> 0:7:57,84
from non-life, as the science that's
repeatable, observable, testable refutes


81
0:7:57,84 --> 0:7:59,28
you.


82
0:7:59,28 --> 0:8:2,72
But it also blows me away that both Isaak
and theScienceFoundation both claimed


83
0:8:2,72 --> 0:8:8,56
that Pasteur actually refuted a form of
creationism.  Really?


84
0:8:8,56 --> 0:8:19,45
In the words of Dr. Manny Rios:  


85
0:8:19,45 --> 0:8:46,31
Brock Lee said essentially the same thing:


86
0:8:46,31 --> 0:8:51,98
Lee documents this well in his book
"Comparative Views on Origins."


87
0:8:51,98 --> 0:8:58,33
It is a ludicrous statement to claim that
Pasteur refuted creation - read Pasteur's


88
0:8:58,33 --> 0:9:4,4
comments yourself, he knew full well the
ramifications of his experiment. Every


89
0:9:4,4 --> 0:9:9,78
form of creation that I know of claims that
life only comes from life. Now yes, we


90
0:9:9,78 --> 0:9:14,64
claim that the first life arose from outside
of nature, but in the end, that is exactly


91
0:9:14,64 --> 0:9:19,52
what evolution must also contend,
because the first life has to arise in direct


92
0:9:19,52 --> 0:9:24,68
violation of scientific and natural laws -
therefore if it violates natural laws, it must


93
0:9:24,68 --> 0:9:29,75
be SUPERnatural, or outside of the
natural realm!


94
0:9:29,75 --> 0:9:33,95
Ironically, both Isaak and
thesciencefoundation have both claimed


95
0:9:33,95 --> 0:9:39,9
elsewhere that evolution does not attempt
to explain the origin of life - so doesn't it


96
0:9:39,9 --> 0:9:42,72
seem odd to you that they would
suddenly turn around and try to argue


97
0:9:42,72 --> 0:9:47,35
against the law of biogenesis?
The first life had to have come from


98
0:9:47,35 --> 0:9:52,3
outside of the natural realm - I would
suggest that first life was Jesus Christ,


99
0:9:52,3 --> 0:9:53,79
the Creator.

0:10:29,87 --> 0:10:54,93
message in last weeks show:


106
0:10:54,93 --> 0:10:59,78
Thanks for writing in, but apparently you
missed the fun from the week before, and


107
0:10:59,78 --> 0:11:4,37
several shows back where I showed how
all of the alleged fish-tetrapod


108
0:11:4,37 --> 0:11:9,83
intermediates were invalidated, both by
tetrapod footprints found in Poland, as


109
0:11:9,83 --> 0:11:13,76
well as the tetrapod footprints in the
bottom of Grand Canyon, which John


110
0:11:13,76 --> 0:11:19,46
Mackay publicized back in 1987 -
Footprints in rocks evolutionarily dated as


111
0:11:19,46 --> 0:11:25,81
525 million years old, which I also went
and investigated several years ago.  These


112
0:11:25,81 --> 0:11:30,69
clear tetrapod footprints predate the
alleged fishapods by some 130 million


113
0:11:30,69 --> 0:11:36,25
years!  Those fossil footprints are only
one small part of the literally tons of


114
0:11:36,25 --> 0:11:40,84
evidence FOR creation, and refuting
Evolutionism that you are apparently


115
0:11:40,84 --> 0:12:21,66
unaware of.


116
0:12:21,66 --> 0:12:25,71
No, you are talking about pseudoscience.
Apparently you missed the point I was


117
0:12:25,71 --> 0:12:30,97
making: If a prediction is made based on
evolution, as I showed in the previous


118
0:12:30,97 --> 0:12:37,71
show, it fails the predictions miserably.
Evolution would not predict tetrapod


119
0:12:37,71 --> 0:12:42,78
footprints in 525 million year old rock!  But
rather than concede that evolution is


120
0:12:42,78 --> 0:12:49,81
wrong, evolution is then made to FIT the
evidence, no matter what the evidence is!


121
0:12:49,81 --> 0:12:55,26
Therefore, evolution is not scientific
because it is not falsifiable.


122
0:12:55,26 --> 0:12:58,51
Several people commented on the
interesting report of the slowing spin of


123
0:12:58,51 --> 0:13:15,49
Venus:


124
0:13:15,49 --> 0:13:20,43
Your analogy breaks down horribly!  We're
not talking about a 1 degree temperature


125
0:13:20,43 --> 0:13:25,69
change here. We're talking about a
rotation change of 6-1/2 minutes in 16


126
0:13:25,69 --> 0:13:31,21
years! Secondly, I never said the slowing
was constant, I merely pointed out the


127
0:13:31,21 --> 0:13:37,45
implications if it was. And isn't it amazing
how quickly the skeptics will abandon


128
0:13:37,45 --> 0:13:42,65
uniformity when it doesn't meet their
purposes.


129
0:13:42,65 --> 0:13:45,91
The science foundation also jumped on
this one, and was put in his place by T


130
0:13:45,91 --> 0:14:27,76
Chapman500:


131
0:14:27,76 --> 0:14:32,34
Indeed, the physics are quite simple -
such alleged impacts would destroy the


132
0:14:32,34 --> 0:14:36,74
planet, and if there was a continuing
barrage of small impacts slowing it down


133
0:14:36,74 --> 0:14:42,29
or spinning it retrograde, then we
SHOULD SEE EVIDENCE OF THIS, as the


134
0:14:42,29 --> 0:15:0,51
slowing has persisted even in the past 16
years. 


135
0:15:0,51 --> 0:15:22,77
Thank you for writing in herbiepop
