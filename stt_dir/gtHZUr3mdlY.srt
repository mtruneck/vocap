2
0:0:7,4 --> 0:0:13,529
So the first question why did he become an entrepreneur and


3
0:0:13,529 --> 0:0:17,71
this anybody can you know go first?


4
0:0:17,71 --> 0:0:20,679
Well I started by entrepreneur journey you know


5
0:0:20,679 --> 0:0:24,269
unconventionally, I actually dropped at high school on 16 so


6
0:0:24,269 --> 0:0:27,119
actually it would cause me to become an entrepreneur was a


7
0:0:27,119 --> 0:0:29,369
little bit different. My family was going through little


8
0:0:29,369 --> 0:0:32,619
hardships I was trying to go ahead and help out and you know


9
0:0:32,619 --> 0:0:36,269
basically try it out. My first job and only job was trying


10
0:0:36,269 --> 0:0:40,409
out for McDonalds and they rejected me so. I realized that


11
0:0:40,409 --> 0:0:43,989
hey there is something called the internet and looked at


12
0:0:43,989 --> 0:0:48,599
what was going on I mean the full year of it and fell in


13
0:0:48,599 --> 0:0:52,19
love with the whole online advertising space and you know


14
0:0:52,19 --> 0:0:55,0
the beauty of the internet is you don't need the stigma


15
0:0:55,0 --> 0:0:58,269
that's attached to kind of business as it was probably 50


16
0:0:58,269 --> 0:1:2,109
years ago. I mean you can be a 16-year-old in a bedroom and


17
0:1:2,109 --> 0:1:4,519
start a business that two years later you can sell for $40


18
0:1:4,519 --> 0:1:8,549
million. And you know that probably wasn't possible 50 years


19
0:1:8,549 --> 0:1:11,819
ago so you know part of the survival helped me become an


20
0:1:11,819 --> 0:1:14,859
entrepreneur but on top of that I love building stuff out of


21
0:1:14,859 --> 0:1:17,92
nothing so encashment about it as long as you are having a


22
0:1:17,92 --> 0:1:18,92
DNA be successful.


23
0:1:18,92 --> 0:1:25,909
So I became an entrepreneur pretty much out of necessity. I


24
0:1:25,909 --> 0:1:31,379
had been working at a public accounting firm then passed


25
0:1:31,379 --> 0:1:35,739
over for partnership two times and I can see that the third


26
0:1:35,739 --> 0:1:40,719
was coming up. And the only reason was because I was woman


27
0:1:40,719 --> 0:1:45,269
and at this point there were 0 women in the partnership


28
0:1:45,269 --> 0:1:53,89
across the world. And that just wasn't okay with me but I


29
0:1:53,89 --> 0:1:58,399
had butted my head up against the glass ceiling enough times


30
0:1:58,399 --> 0:2:4,269
and at this point had enough visibility across the whole


31
0:2:4,269 --> 0:2:9,96
firm to know that I wasn't personally going to be able to


32
0:2:9,96 --> 0:2:16,319
change this organization from the inside. So I left and


33
0:2:16,319 --> 0:2:21,299
turned around and offered them my services for basically the


34
0:2:21,299 --> 0:2:25,28
exact same thing that they would have had if I had been


35
0:2:25,28 --> 0:2:30,59
partner within their structure and asked them to pay me


36
0:2:30,59 --> 0:2:36,349
three times as much. They agreed, which was the amazing


37
0:2:36,349 --> 0:2:43,329
part, provided me an office and let me keep my


38
0:2:43,329 --> 0:2:47,159
administrative assistant for their first six months and I


39
0:2:47,159 --> 0:2:54,349
was totally billable from the very, very first day. And that


40
0:2:54,349 --> 0:2:59,15
grew into an organization that had employees across the


41
0:2:59,15 --> 0:3:5,59
world and then you know kind of once you get the bug it just


42
0:3:5,59 --> 0:3:9,399
kind of starts taking over and so I was like well you know


43
0:3:9,399 --> 0:3:12,9
there is a problem here, I can solve it by doing this. There


44
0:3:12,9 --> 0:3:17,389
is a problem there and I can go solve that by doing this and


45
0:3:17,389 --> 0:3:18,389
I love it.


46
0:3:18,389 --> 0:3:26,3
Yeah, so I guess the best answer that I can give is that I


47
0:3:26,3 --> 0:3:29,39
didn't decide to become an entrepreneur, and I mean that in


48
0:3:29,39 --> 0:3:32,199
two ways. One, I am actually not quite an entrepreneur. I


49
0:3:32,199 --> 0:3:34,699
don't really deserve to be called an entrepreneur unlike all


50
0:3:34,699 --> 0:3:37,449
the other people up here. I have always sort of helped


51
0:3:37,449 --> 0:3:41,869
entrepreneurs. I joined the LinkedIn and Facebook before we


52
0:3:41,869 --> 0:3:44,819
raised venture funding, before the companies were built and


53
0:3:44,819 --> 0:3:51,939
so on so very, very, very early in those companies. But I


54
0:3:51,939 --> 0:3:54,319
always sort of liked helping entrepreneurs. They used to


55
0:3:54,319 --> 0:3:56,819
call that thing a venture capitals but that means something


56
0:3:56,819 --> 0:4:1,679
else today I guess. So the second way in which I mean that


57
0:4:1,679 --> 0:4:5,349
and just really amplifying what Carol just spoke to is I


58
0:4:5,349 --> 0:4:8,889
think of lot of the time people who end up being


59
0:4:8,889 --> 0:4:11,449
entrepreneurs don't really exactly decide to become


60
0:4:11,449 --> 0:4:14,449
entrepreneurs. It's not like being an accountant where you


61
0:4:14,449 --> 0:4:18,199
say you know I am going to go out and you know take a test


62
0:4:18,199 --> 0:4:21,449
and get a license and go become an accountant. You know I am


63
0:4:21,449 --> 0:4:23,949
going to go to an entrepreneur school and become an


64
0:4:23,949 --> 0:4:26,449
entrepreneur. It's a little bit more organic than that, a


65
0:4:26,449 --> 0:4:29,199
lot of the time in my experience. And it's just something


66
0:4:29,199 --> 0:4:32,449
that almost happens to you or that you get the bug for like


67
0:4:32,449 --> 0:4:34,86
you said usually because something is broken that you want


68
0:4:34,86 --> 0:4:38,39
to fix or because something doesn't exist that you think


69
0:4:38,39 --> 0:4:43,62
should exist. And you just decide you know I am going to do


70
0:4:43,62 --> 0:4:46,62
it. And that can take lots of different forms but I think


71
0:4:46,62 --> 0:4:49,37
it's a more organic process than a lot of other so-called


72
0:4:49,37 --> 0:4:52,62
career paths.


73
0:4:52,62 --> 0:4:56,37
I actually never aspired to become an entrepreneur and I was


74
0:4:56,37 --> 0:4:58,68
working as a research scientist and I thoroughly enjoyed


75
0:4:58,68 --> 0:5:1,75
that. And as I know I inspire to become an entrepreneur


76
0:5:1,75 --> 0:5:4,75
working as a manager or working in business in the first


77
0:5:4,75 --> 0:5:9,69
place. But the thing that made an impact on me was that I


78
0:5:9,69 --> 0:5:12,6
was actually reading the specification for Netscape 2.0,


79
0:5:12,6 --> 0:5:16,259
some years ago some of them may remember the browser


80
0:5:16,259 --> 0:5:19,74
Netscape. But I was reading the whole night and I was really


81
0:5:19,74 --> 0:5:23,579
taken by this, and it had an enormous impact on me. So the


82
0:5:23,579 --> 0:5:26,37
next day I actually quit my job and started my first


83
0:5:26,37 --> 0:5:29,889
company. And I had no idea what kind of business idea I was


84
0:5:29,889 --> 0:5:33,879
going to pursue and I really didn't have so much of a plan


85
0:5:33,879 --> 0:5:37,469
but it was more this incredible passion I felt for internet.


86
0:5:37,469 --> 0:5:40,199
I could just sense that internet was going to be a really,


87
0:5:40,199 --> 0:5:44,479
really big and I felt it was too big of a thing to walk away


88
0:5:44,479 --> 0:5:47,259
from. So that's actually why I started.


89
0:5:47,259 --> 0:5:52,609
So in a life of an entrepreneur, now you are all living a


90
0:5:52,609 --> 0:5:55,5
life of an entrepreneur what is it you like about the life


91
0:5:55,5 --> 0:5:58,609
of an entrepreneur and what is it that you don't like about


92
0:5:58,609 --> 0:6:3,37
the path that you have chosen? Anybody, you can just go to


93
0:6:3,37 --> 0:6:4,37
anywhere you like?


94
0:6:4,37 --> 0:6:8,349
I guess what I love about is you know it probably goes both


95
0:6:8,349 --> 0:6:11,289
ways. I love creating something out of nothing and seeing


96
0:6:11,289 --> 0:6:14,81
that impact it's almost like you can see it nurture and you


97
0:6:14,81 --> 0:6:18,6
can see the positive result as quick as you can kind of make


98
0:6:18,6 --> 0:6:20,859
it happen. The downside of it being an entrepreneur is that


99
0:6:20,859 --> 0:6:24,729
it's not as you know passion stable as a typical company


100
0:6:24,729 --> 0:6:28,31
where you have enough stings in place but you don't have to


101
0:6:28,31 --> 0:6:30,81
worry about the revenue, you don't have to worry about


102
0:6:30,81 --> 0:6:33,6
profitability, you don't have to worry about the individual


103
0:6:33,6 --> 0:6:36,24
things so you end up losing a few hairs almost everyday. So


104
0:6:36,24 --> 0:6:39,24
part of being in the startup is you know is you have your


105
0:6:39,24 --> 0:6:42,49
good days and you have your bad days but you know you fall


106
0:6:42,49 --> 0:6:44,74
down and you get up and you keep going.


107
0:6:44,74 --> 0:6:49,909
So in the corporate world I used to be called a workaholic


108
0:6:49,909 --> 0:6:54,609
and I am a pretty passionate person and when I am on a


109
0:6:54,609 --> 0:6:58,609
project or working on trying to get something done I pretty


110
0:6:58,609 --> 0:7:5,649
much stay focused on that and that used to be considered a


111
0:7:5,649 --> 0:7:11,99
bad thing. And when I became an entrepreneur everybody just


112
0:7:11,99 --> 0:7:16,989
started saying oh she is an entrepreneur it's okay. And so I


113
0:7:16,989 --> 0:7:21,5
suddenly became socially acceptable about the fact that my


114
0:7:21,5 --> 0:7:27,589
work life and my personal life had a very, very blurry line.


115
0:7:27,589 --> 0:7:32,29
Blurry line if you are lucky. Yeah, you know, the best thing


116
0:7:32,29 --> 0:7:36,149
about it is that it's amazing and all consuming and


117
0:7:36,149 --> 0:7:38,859
exhausting and crazy and the worst thing about is that it's


118
0:7:38,859 --> 0:7:42,37
amazing in all consuming, exhausting and crazy. It will


119
0:7:42,37 --> 0:7:45,739
become your life if you are lucky and you are doing it well.


120
0:7:45,739 --> 0:7:49,789
And there are straight offs in that but you know I feel like


121
0:7:49,789 --> 0:7:52,959
the last ten or so years of my life or more or less this


122
0:7:52,959 --> 0:7:58,199
vortex of non-stop startupness which is great I wouldn't


123
0:7:58,199 --> 0:8:3,399
trade it for anything. But I think it almost becomes an


124
0:8:3,399 --> 0:8:6,319
either-or decision at some point if you are lucky enough to


125
0:8:6,319 --> 0:8:9,169
be facing that problem.


126
0:8:9,169 --> 0:8:14,299
I think for me the biggest thing is the dream you know that


127
0:8:14,299 --> 0:8:18,79
you can allow yourself to dream, you can allow yourself to


128
0:8:18,79 --> 0:8:20,609
you know you are going to credit company, you are going to


129
0:8:20,609 --> 0:8:23,859
have an impact over the world you know and it's at the end


130
0:8:23,859 --> 0:8:27,359
of the day it's really all up to you. So I think that's a


131
0:8:27,359 --> 0:8:29,609
fantastic luxury that there is really no limitation. It's


132
0:8:29,609 --> 0:8:33,329
all about your capability, your creativity and your hard


133
0:8:33,329 --> 0:8:37,59
work that at the end of the day hopefully, you will be able


134
0:8:37,59 --> 0:8:39,24
to accomplish what you are set out to do.


135
0:8:39,24 --> 0:8:43,47
You know the things that all of us are talking about is that


136
0:8:43,47 --> 0:8:46,559
we are doing it because we have some passion about what we


137
0:8:46,559 --> 0:8:52,379
are doing and with whom we are doing it. And you know one of


138
0:8:52,379 --> 0:8:55,129
the things that you will hear people give you advice about


139
0:8:55,129 --> 0:8:58,98
over and over again is stay focused on your passion and the


140
0:8:58,98 --> 0:9:2,84
reason is if you hate what you are doing you won't be


141
0:9:2,84 --> 0:9:6,98
successful as an entrepreneur because it requires too much


142
0:9:6,98 --> 0:9:11,799
extra effort. And you have to really love it to make the


143
0:9:11,799 --> 0:9:15,449
sacrifices that are necessary to be successful.


144
0:9:15,449 --> 0:9:18,909
You also are a little bit crazy to enjoy the ups and downs


145
0:9:18,909 --> 0:9:22,409
of it because there is a lot of ups and lot of downs along


146
0:9:22,409 --> 0:9:25,799
the way but I think the other key thing is like if you look


147
0:9:25,799 --> 0:9:28,549
at just how the business world works you know big companies


148
0:9:28,549 --> 0:9:32,299
get to run it but in a startup you get to change it. And you


149
0:9:32,299 --> 0:9:35,49
know if you look at you know company like Facebook, Twitter


150
0:9:35,49 --> 0:9:37,399
and just social media in general that's really transpired


151
0:9:37,399 --> 0:9:41,679
the way we communicate, big companies are now falling onto


152
0:9:41,679 --> 0:9:44,36
that. So I think that's the highlight of being entrepreneurs


153
0:9:44,36 --> 0:9:46,829
when you can make that big of an impact and if you are part


154
0:9:46,829 --> 0:9:49,929
of that genre you can really go ahead and see why you are


155
0:9:49,929 --> 0:9:52,429
passionate about it you are making a change and it's a lot


156
0:9:52,429 --> 0:9:53,429
of fun.


157
0:9:53,429 --> 0:9:53,429
[Informal Talk]


158
0:9:53,429 --> 0:9:59,39
Don't you have the phenomenal when you are entrepreneur and


159
0:9:59,39 --> 0:10:1,529
that is to pick the people you actually are going to work


160
0:10:1,529 --> 0:10:4,549
with and I think that really makes a big difference, you


161
0:10:4,549 --> 0:10:8,379
know one thing is to have this, objective, dream, desire but


162
0:10:8,379 --> 0:10:10,449
you can actually work with people that are phenomenally


163
0:10:10,449 --> 0:10:13,559
inspiring, people that are fun to hang out with, people that


164
0:10:13,559 --> 0:10:16,829
you really care about. And regardless of where you want to


165
0:10:16,829 --> 0:10:19,509
go with the company, regardless what you want to accomplish,


166
0:10:19,509 --> 0:10:22,509
just a luxury that everyday you will go to work, you are


167
0:10:22,509 --> 0:10:24,779
working with people that fundamentally are people that you


168
0:10:24,779 --> 0:10:28,689
like and you want to hang out with I think that is a


169
0:10:28,689 --> 0:10:31,569
phenomenal perk if you can put it that way.


170
0:10:31,569 --> 0:10:36,24
So it's a great segue through the next question and so we


171
0:10:36,24 --> 0:10:39,509
have some we have both pure entrepreneurs and we have some


172
0:10:39,509 --> 0:10:42,689
venture capital experience here so you can answer it from


173
0:10:42,689 --> 0:10:46,139
either perspective. Do you think it's better in the


174
0:10:46,139 --> 0:10:49,19
construction of an entrepreneurial company to partner to


175
0:10:49,19 --> 0:10:53,219
have a partner with someone that maybe as complementary


176
0:10:53,219 --> 0:10:57,99
skills or vision or whatever or is it better we go it alone?


177
0:10:57,99 --> 0:11:1,339
I think it's a frustrating answer but it depends on the


178
0:11:1,339 --> 0:11:8,639
person. And you know there are people who are absolutely


179
0:11:8,639 --> 0:11:15,11
solo creators who have a very individual drive and that's


180
0:11:15,11 --> 0:11:18,99
the way they function. There are people who you know thrive


181
0:11:18,99 --> 0:11:22,689
and need a partner. I think you know the funny thing about


182
0:11:22,689 --> 0:11:27,23
startups is this whole thing is driven by exceptions, you


183
0:11:27,23 --> 0:11:31,59
know you can create anywhere you like you know, oh you know


184
0:11:31,59 --> 0:11:34,309
startups where the husband and wife are founders together


185
0:11:34,309 --> 0:11:36,829
that always goes well except for Cisco. You know startups,


186
0:11:36,829 --> 0:11:40,669
so I mean no matter what you pick there are always


187
0:11:40,669 --> 0:11:44,579
exceptions. So it's very hard to generalize out of those


188
0:11:44,579 --> 0:11:48,59
things. You know I have been involved in companies where


189
0:11:48,59 --> 0:11:52,159
there were kind of cofounders and a founder and cofounders


190
0:11:52,159 --> 0:11:56,1
and just a founder and I think all of them can work. The


191
0:11:56,1 --> 0:11:58,659
most important thing if you are starting something yourself


192
0:11:58,659 --> 0:12:1,659
I think is to ask yourself what's the right thing for you.


193
0:12:1,659 --> 0:12:4,909
And just like with a lot of the other things that we have


194
0:12:4,909 --> 0:12:7,909
been talking about it really should be a sort of an organic


195
0:12:7,909 --> 0:12:10,909
process. I think if you sit down and say alright today I


196
0:12:10,909 --> 0:12:13,659
need to go out and find myself a cofounder that's probably


197
0:12:13,659 --> 0:12:14,659
not going to succeed.


198
0:12:14,659 --> 0:12:18,129
I think it's all about you know the couple of ways to look


199
0:12:18,129 --> 0:12:21,379
at it part of it is finding your dream team and you know,


200
0:12:21,379 --> 0:12:23,379
either all your cofounding employees and that's really


201
0:12:23,379 --> 0:12:27,269
essential for any startup your first five people make it or


202
0:12:27,269 --> 0:12:30,19
break it to actually seeing if it's going to survive first


203
0:12:30,19 --> 0:12:33,269
20 people, make it to see if it's going to be a large


204
0:12:33,269 --> 0:12:36,269
company or not. And you know when you get to that standpoint


205
0:12:36,269 --> 0:12:39,269
you got to go ahead and realize who your right partners are


206
0:12:39,269 --> 0:12:42,19
going to be and partner can be beyond cofounder it's really


207
0:12:42,19 --> 0:12:45,19
VC. And you know just a short plug for Stanford. Stanford is


208
0:12:45,19 --> 0:12:48,19
actually an investor in gWallet, so I think we have got you


209
0:12:48,19 --> 0:12:50,769
know we picked the right investors for the right reasons and


210
0:12:50,769 --> 0:12:53,23
partly is because you know they can actually add a


211
0:12:53,23 --> 0:12:56,659
tremendous value. I mean if you look at my first company I


212
0:12:56,659 --> 0:12:59,19
actually take no funding whatsoever. I bootstrapped it


213
0:12:59,19 --> 0:13:2,459
mainly because nobody wanted to fund me. I was 16, 17, 18 so


214
0:13:2,459 --> 0:13:6,329
no offense on that but you know what I learned on the second


215
0:13:6,329 --> 0:13:9,699
time around is when I actually raised venture capital is it


216
0:13:9,699 --> 0:13:12,25
matured me as an entrepreneur. It actually brought a


217
0:13:12,25 --> 0:13:15,549
different perspective on how to grow large company, how to


218
0:13:15,549 --> 0:13:18,329
actually sustain certain things that you do international


219
0:13:18,329 --> 0:13:22,319
expansion so forth and picking that right partner is key,


220
0:13:22,319 --> 0:13:25,159
because if you put the wrong one, you know VCs can either


221
0:13:25,159 --> 0:13:28,669
add a lot of value or take a lot of value out. So, that's


222
0:13:28,669 --> 0:13:33,19
the caveat, no offence but that's the big formula into


223
0:13:33,19 --> 0:13:36,139
finding the right magic in that partnership.


224
0:13:36,139 --> 0:13:40,61
So you know the other part is whether or not to do it alone


225
0:13:40,61 --> 0:13:46,399
or in the team. It is also based on if you need outside


226
0:13:46,399 --> 0:13:51,879
money you know, how are you going to get it, and in the


227
0:13:51,879 --> 0:13:55,809
venture world one of the conventions is basically never


228
0:13:55,809 --> 0:14:0,809
invest in a single entrepreneur. And the bottom-line is if


229
0:14:0,809 --> 0:14:4,589
that entrepreneur gets hit by a bus you know what do we


230
0:14:4,589 --> 0:14:9,459
have, so if we have at least two people on a team and one


231
0:14:9,459 --> 0:14:12,74
person gets hit by a bus then at least theoretically there


232
0:14:12,74 --> 0:14:18,99
is somebody to kind of go forward and so typically by the


233
0:14:18,99 --> 0:14:24,86
time you see them any entrepreneur company coming forth to a


234
0:14:24,86 --> 0:14:28,929
venture capital from, you will see that they have you know


235
0:14:28,929 --> 0:14:31,86
gotten to a point where they have at least the outward


236
0:14:31,86 --> 0:14:38,639
appearance of being a team.


237
0:14:38,639 --> 0:14:39,639
[Informal Talk]


238
0:14:39,639 --> 0:14:45,399
Angels kind of go back and forth and since I happened to


239
0:14:45,399 --> 0:14:49,899
[inaudible] both communities you know there are lots of


240
0:14:49,899 --> 0:14:56,389
angels that will fund single entrepreneur and then tell them


241
0:14:56,389 --> 0:15:0,659
you have to go find you know other cofounders but you know


242
0:15:0,659 --> 0:15:7,439
it depends on how much money you need.


243
0:15:7,439 --> 0:15:11,59
I think the question when you need a cofounder or not,


244
0:15:11,59 --> 0:15:13,639
perhaps the most important thing is who you choose as


245
0:15:13,639 --> 0:15:19,899
cofounder and in the hit or the moment or in the excitement


246
0:15:19,899 --> 0:15:22,649
actually hatching an idea I think that is easy to find


247
0:15:22,649 --> 0:15:25,399
somebody that is your soul mate right there in than right,


248
0:15:25,399 --> 0:15:28,649
they are all excited, oh let's do this and you know they all


249
0:15:28,649 --> 0:15:34,289
worked up about it, but if you in a cofounder looking for


250
0:15:34,289 --> 0:15:37,839
somebody that can help you build a company long term I think


251
0:15:37,839 --> 0:15:42,25
it's very important to dive below the initial excitement


252
0:15:42,25 --> 0:15:46,409
right, what is that person's long term contribution and what


253
0:15:46,409 --> 0:15:50,74
is that person's long term commitment and aspirations for


254
0:15:50,74 --> 0:15:57,889
the project. And when I see in startups fail and succeeded,


255
0:15:57,889 --> 0:16:2,62
I have seen a lot of startups fail, that founding team was


256
0:16:2,62 --> 0:16:7,199
wrong founding team and the founding team did not have long


257
0:16:7,199 --> 0:16:12,9
term aligned objectives and perhaps one was wanted to work


258
0:16:12,9 --> 0:16:15,29
really hard for a long time and the other one decided to it


259
0:16:15,29 --> 0:16:18,859
was fun for a year or two but then later the person was not


260
0:16:18,859 --> 0:16:21,599
willing to work as hard any more and if they didn't then


261
0:16:21,599 --> 0:16:24,689
have a shareholder agreement that who regulated for whatever


262
0:16:24,689 --> 0:16:28,49
reason was going to happen down the road. It creates a lot


263
0:16:28,49 --> 0:16:31,629
of tension, right then one person that was a part of the


264
0:16:31,629 --> 0:16:34,709
founding team has a large stake with the company that is


265
0:16:34,709 --> 0:16:36,959
really moving on to do something completely different, so


266
0:16:36,959 --> 0:16:41,669
that can create a lot of issues and problems for a company I


267
0:16:41,669 --> 0:16:42,909
think.


268
0:16:42,909 --> 0:16:46,99
Just to add on that I think it's pretty crucial when you


269
0:16:46,99 --> 0:16:49,24
actually find that person or find your dream team is to find


270
0:16:49,24 --> 0:16:52,819
the right DNA that has the hunger because partly even one


271
0:16:52,819 --> 0:16:56,62
hiring in my third company it's you know you would assume I


272
0:16:56,62 --> 0:16:59,479
would have the pick of the run in hiring the best talent and


273
0:16:59,479 --> 0:17:2,909
personally there is that pool there but it's really, really


274
0:17:2,909 --> 0:17:4,869
hard when you can look someone in the eye and say is this


275
0:17:4,869 --> 0:17:7,94
person hungry or this person just expecting a great outcome,


276
0:17:7,94 --> 0:17:11,9
because any startup regardless of it doesn't guarantee an


277
0:17:11,9 --> 0:17:14,47
outcome and it's really, really hard to go out and find out


278
0:17:14,47 --> 0:17:17,849
that the consensus DNA is going to go out and do what it


279
0:17:17,849 --> 0:17:20,599
takes to make the exit happen or make the positive outcome


280
0:17:20,599 --> 0:17:24,619
happen and probably 1% of the people are interview I can see


281
0:17:24,619 --> 0:17:28,109
their hunger. 99% just don't have it, so it's really finding


282
0:17:28,109 --> 0:17:31,259
that 1% especially in that first five employees, especially


283
0:17:31,259 --> 0:17:34,879
in the first 20 employees because if you don't you are going


284
0:17:34,879 --> 0:17:39,74
to set yourself up for disappointments and failures.


285
0:17:39,74 --> 0:17:44,129
So, this is one of the questions that I personally can


286
0:17:44,129 --> 0:17:50,69
relate to, have you ever experienced a black day? Now I


287
0:17:50,69 --> 0:17:55,339
describe a black day as all despair and no hope and so if


288
0:17:55,339 --> 0:17:58,669
you have could you tell us about it, you know kind of


289
0:17:58,669 --> 0:18:1,819
anecdotally share it with us and then tell us you know how


290
0:18:1,819 --> 0:18:4,24
you dealt with it internally because it's certainly


291
0:18:4,24 --> 0:18:8,19
difficult and how did you deal with your company. So I think


292
0:18:8,19 --> 0:18:11,21
everybody probably has a story I think that but -


293
0:18:11,21 --> 0:18:14,609
I think for any successful entrepreneurs you have to have a


294
0:18:14,609 --> 0:18:18,99
few black days because they ground you and they also teach


295
0:18:18,99 --> 0:18:20,349
you a lot that something that something school or -


296
0:18:20,349 --> 0:18:21,599
You have more than one.


297
0:18:21,599 --> 0:18:24,849
I have had my fair share and probably more than I wanted but


298
0:18:24,849 --> 0:18:28,99
I think the primary one that sticks the mind was, I was 16,


299
0:18:28,99 --> 0:18:30,849
six months in my business dropped out of high school was


300
0:18:30,849 --> 0:18:33,2
doing $200,000-$300,000 a month in revenue, highly


301
0:18:33,2 --> 0:18:37,71
profitable and started hiring the right people and I didn't


302
0:18:37,71 --> 0:18:40,759
have any formal contracts in place with the primary engineer


303
0:18:40,759 --> 0:18:44,889
person that I had that was managing the technology and I


304
0:18:44,889 --> 0:18:48,679
just got threat from them that, if I did not give my third


305
0:18:48,679 --> 0:18:51,929
of a company they will shut me down. And again 16 and half


306
0:18:51,929 --> 0:18:55,789
years old, did not have any idea so I was trying to play


307
0:18:55,789 --> 0:18:59,269
Poker and obviously they don't work in my favor and they


308
0:18:59,269 --> 0:19:2,2
actually did shut me down. And obviously when you are under-


309
0:19:2,2 --> 0:19:5,69
funded you don't have a board, you are 16, nobody is going


310
0:19:5,69 --> 0:19:7,909
to really take you seriously. So imagine all the odds


311
0:19:7,909 --> 0:19:11,539
against you, and imagine completely being out of business


312
0:19:11,539 --> 0:19:15,379
for a full week. So imagine no Facebook for a week, imagine


313
0:19:15,379 --> 0:19:18,94
your e-mail not working for a week, imagine whatever service


314
0:19:18,94 --> 0:19:21,69
you are running is gone from the internet, and the internet


315
0:19:21,69 --> 0:19:25,19
is 24x7 business, right. So that happened and it took me a


316
0:19:25,19 --> 0:19:29,109
week to go ahead and recover from that until I recovered


317
0:19:29,109 --> 0:19:32,5
from the servers and until I got the right people to turn it


318
0:19:32,5 --> 0:19:37,19
back on, and you know it was a mess, it was a mess and what


319
0:19:37,19 --> 0:19:40,269
I realized is that there is a couple of things you got to


320
0:19:40,269 --> 0:19:43,759
do. #1, never keep yourself vulnerable, if you are an


321
0:19:43,759 --> 0:19:46,9
entrepreneur always have a backup plan, always have someone


322
0:19:46,9 --> 0:19:49,9
else that's you can have back or you better make sure you


323
0:19:49,9 --> 0:19:51,759
have that skill-set on yourself because if you don't you are


324
0:19:51,759 --> 0:19:54,21
going to have situations like this. #2 always surround


325
0:19:54,21 --> 0:19:57,259
yourself around people that want to make you win and see you


326
0:19:57,259 --> 0:20:0,399
win. And you know make sure you have the right rock stars


327
0:20:0,399 --> 0:20:3,759
with you, because if you don't have the right people you are


328
0:20:3,759 --> 0:20:6,75
going to have you know so many of these horror stories over


329
0:20:6,75 --> 0:20:10,179
and over. And you know I learned a lot from that and I wasn'


330
0:20:10,179 --> 0:20:12,929
t cheap on employees, I wasn't cheap on any of the


331
0:20:12,929 --> 0:20:15,929
structures I needed to do from thereon and you know a year


332
0:20:15,929 --> 0:20:18,929
and two months after that point is actually when I sold the


333
0:20:18,929 --> 0:20:21,679
company for $40 million. So yeah that was probably the most


334
0:20:21,679 --> 0:20:25,25
black day of any teenager's life that you can imagine but


335
0:20:25,25 --> 0:20:27,329
you know it ended up becoming a positive outcome because I


336
0:20:27,329 --> 0:20:30,889
learned a lot from it, and a lot of it, from at least from


337
0:20:30,889 --> 0:20:33,72
my entrepreneur journey came from making these mistakes and


338
0:20:33,72 --> 0:20:37,139
actually seeing these disappointments come to life, because


339
0:20:37,139 --> 0:20:40,649
they ground you and they teach you a lot and they prepare


340
0:20:40,649 --> 0:20:44,71
you for the future.


341
0:20:44,71 --> 0:20:49,59
So, I think there is probably two kinds of black days. There


342
0:20:49,59 --> 0:20:52,429
are the black days, which Mark defined as there is where


343
0:20:52,429 --> 0:20:56,809
there is truly all despair and no hope and we have all had


344
0:20:56,809 --> 0:21:1,73
those days in our lives in some ways. You know this is just


345
0:21:1,73 --> 0:21:5,71
part of life, so these things happen. I think with startups


346
0:21:5,71 --> 0:21:8,94
in my experience, it usually takes one or two forms either


347
0:21:8,94 --> 0:21:11,7
you have had some great momentum and it suddenly stopped or


348
0:21:11,7 --> 0:21:14,389
it's just slowed down dramatically and you don't know how


349
0:21:14,389 --> 0:21:17,669
you going to find your way back out of that, or a people,


350
0:21:17,669 --> 0:21:20,809
and you know those take-all kinds of forms. But there are


351
0:21:20,809 --> 0:21:24,619
also a lot of black days where there actually is some hope


352
0:21:24,619 --> 0:21:29,309
in there, if you look at it closely. And so in terms of how


353
0:21:29,309 --> 0:21:35,279
you deal with it, I think trying to find that hope and you


354
0:21:35,279 --> 0:21:38,79
know trying to find the kernel of what's going to enable you


355
0:21:38,79 --> 0:21:40,94
to turn this around whether it's something specific and


356
0:21:40,94 --> 0:21:44,22
tactical or something emotional is really important. You


357
0:21:44,22 --> 0:21:48,139
know personal example of that which has been talked about a


358
0:21:48,139 --> 0:21:50,829
lot is when we launched the news-feed at Facebook in the


359
0:21:50,829 --> 0:21:55,519
fall of 2006 and we had a product that, we had a lot of


360
0:21:55,519 --> 0:21:58,909
conviction around and felt it was a great product, which was


361
0:21:58,909 --> 0:22:2,259
a great product. We just did a really, really incredibly


362
0:22:2,259 --> 0:22:5,319
terrible job of actually launching it and preparing people


363
0:22:5,319 --> 0:22:10,519
for it, or not preparing people for it. And the reaction was


364
0:22:10,519 --> 0:22:14,799
you know unbelievable. We had 10% of the user base actively


365
0:22:14,799 --> 0:22:18,509
protesting against us, 10% of the user base a million people


366
0:22:18,509 --> 0:22:21,519
actively protesting. We got a phone call from the Palo Alto


367
0:22:21,519 --> 0:22:25,29
Police Department saying turn it off right now because there


368
0:22:25,29 --> 0:22:28,29
is going to be a protest rally in Downtown Palo Alto on


369
0:22:28,29 --> 0:22:30,529
Monday and we know have the infrastructure to support a


370
0:22:30,529 --> 0:22:33,529
protest rally in the city, so you have to stop it. Camera


371
0:22:33,529 --> 0:22:36,75
crews coming up the windows of the office, peering into the


372
0:22:36,75 --> 0:22:40,109
office to you know try to get pictures of people. It's just


373
0:22:40,109 --> 0:22:45,629
really unbelievable amount of you know bad feeling and


374
0:22:45,629 --> 0:22:49,329
pressure coming from the entire outside world but what was


375
0:22:49,329 --> 0:22:54,819
so meaningful about that moment for me was that was the


376
0:22:54,819 --> 0:23:0,269
moment when I fully understood for the first time just how


377
0:23:0,269 --> 0:23:4,429
important this was to people, that people cared about this


378
0:23:4,429 --> 0:23:8,549
so much that they would get this subset of habit in large


379
0:23:8,549 --> 0:23:13,39
numbers. So my god there is something going on here, which


380
0:23:13,39 --> 0:23:16,48
is really, really rare and very special and we have a


381
0:23:16,48 --> 0:23:19,679
problem that we need to deal with. But you know underneath


382
0:23:19,679 --> 0:23:22,19
that all there is something very powerful here that we can


383
0:23:22,19 --> 0:23:25,599
harness you know if we do it in a right way, so there are


384
0:23:25,599 --> 0:23:28,379
situations in life whether in your startup or the rest of


385
0:23:28,379 --> 0:23:32,319
the life where things are just bad and there just is no,


386
0:23:32,319 --> 0:23:36,22
nothing can do about it, but get through it. But a lot of


387
0:23:36,22 --> 0:23:40,169
times there is actually something more in those situations.


388
0:23:40,169 --> 0:23:43,95
So I would encourage everybody to at least ask the question


389
0:23:43,95 --> 0:23:46,89
is there is something else to this story.


390
0:23:46,89 --> 0:23:51,69
I have actually liked the answer of that question in a


391
0:23:51,69 --> 0:23:54,789
slightly different way. I am a little bit older than most of


392
0:23:54,789 --> 0:23:57,539
the other panelists so I think I have had probably more


393
0:23:57,539 --> 0:24:3,24
black days but what's got me through them is that I picked


394
0:24:3,24 --> 0:24:12,759
up the phone and talk to an advisor and the advisor helped


395
0:24:12,759 --> 0:24:18,399
me put the situation in perspective and one of the


396
0:24:18,399 --> 0:24:22,629
attributes about a really bad black day is the reason why we


397
0:24:22,629 --> 0:24:28,369
call it black is that things went from gray to black.


398
0:24:28,369 --> 0:24:29,859
The black days they are really black.


399
0:24:29,859 --> 0:24:36,169
Yeah, I mean all you can see is bad and negative and your


400
0:24:36,169 --> 0:24:39,639
normal personality of positive and seeing the silver lining


401
0:24:39,639 --> 0:24:45,509
and all, suddenly just left your body and it was that


402
0:24:45,509 --> 0:24:50,789
ability to reach out and have perspective brought back in,


403
0:24:50,789 --> 0:24:57,569
and it's amazing when I look back through my life and I look


404
0:24:57,569 --> 0:25:3,89
at those black days it was literally less than 24 hours


405
0:25:3,89 --> 0:25:7,599
before I was able to reframe that as this is when the


406
0:25:7,599 --> 0:25:15,289
universe changed rather than this is a black day. And I have


407
0:25:15,289 --> 0:25:20,619
now gotten to the point where when I hit black days I am


408
0:25:20,619 --> 0:25:26,549
like, oh universe is about to change, okay. And I actually


409
0:25:26,549 --> 0:25:32,49
now try to very actively be that special advisor for our


410
0:25:32,49 --> 0:25:39,72
portfolio companies and I hope I am the one that, when they


411
0:25:39,72 --> 0:25:41,879
get in trouble that I am the one that they call.


412
0:25:41,879 --> 0:25:50,97
Yeah I think one example of black day for me would be a


413
0:25:50,97 --> 0:25:56,96
complete R&D dead end. So this was this fingerprint research


414
0:25:56,96 --> 0:26:0,73
company that I started Jenkie. So this was a very ambitious


415
0:26:0,73 --> 0:26:3,809
projects and initially we thought it was going to be pretty


416
0:26:3,809 --> 0:26:6,259
easy, we are going to revolutionize how fingerprint matching


417
0:26:6,259 --> 0:26:9,24
algorithms were done. But it turned out to be much-much


418
0:26:9,24 --> 0:26:11,879
harder than we thought and on the way we actually found a


419
0:26:11,879 --> 0:26:15,579
textbook saying that this was actually not possible. It was


420
0:26:15,579 --> 0:26:19,0
theoretically an exciting idea but in practices it wouldn't


421
0:26:19,0 --> 0:26:23,409
work. But of course, that made us more excited and we wanted


422
0:26:23,409 --> 0:26:28,699
you to go on. But as time goes moving on, we were really not


423
0:26:28,699 --> 0:26:33,899
getting any progress and we had spent I think three and a


424
0:26:33,899 --> 0:26:37,579
half years and I spent several millions in funding this and


425
0:26:37,579 --> 0:26:40,549
it was to the point when the engineers on the team they


426
0:26:40,549 --> 0:26:43,669
didn't believe it anymore and everyone else was questioning


427
0:26:43,669 --> 0:26:46,889
whether it was possible to move forward. And I had a wake-up


428
0:26:46,889 --> 0:26:49,359
call one day when one of my friends which I trust really


429
0:26:49,359 --> 0:26:54,0
well said you know you are so stubborn. Why is it that


430
0:26:54,0 --> 0:26:56,889
everyone else in the world believes that this is impossible,


431
0:26:56,889 --> 0:27:0,72
even your engineers working in R&D team and still you


432
0:27:0,72 --> 0:27:5,79
believe that this is doable. And then I started to ask


433
0:27:5,79 --> 0:27:10,23
myself am I delusional, am I completely irrational, am I


434
0:27:10,23 --> 0:27:13,699
just trying to pursue a dream that is really not ever going


435
0:27:13,699 --> 0:27:17,609
to happen and that was a really tough moment for me. And I


436
0:27:17,609 --> 0:27:20,409
was really mulling this over and I was thinking the only


437
0:27:20,409 --> 0:27:23,369
rational thing actually is to throw in a towel, right.


438
0:27:23,369 --> 0:27:25,629
Everyone around me told me that that was going to be the


439
0:27:25,629 --> 0:27:30,73
case. But the thing that made me not throwing the towel was


440
0:27:30,73 --> 0:27:35,509
that when I was really feeling and really thinking through


441
0:27:35,509 --> 0:27:41,419
it deeply I realized that if I threw in the towel now I will


442
0:27:41,419 --> 0:27:45,49
never be able to forgive myself. I am always going to


443
0:27:45,49 --> 0:27:49,389
continue in my life asking what if I didn't throw in the


444
0:27:49,389 --> 0:27:53,22
towel. And when I came to that realization that I decided


445
0:27:53,22 --> 0:27:56,189
that you know whatever it takes, okay, I set aside this


446
0:27:56,189 --> 0:27:59,899
amount of money and whatever it takes this amount of money I


447
0:27:59,899 --> 0:28:3,579
am able to set aside and I am going to go all the way, all


448
0:28:3,579 --> 0:28:7,59
the way to the absolute point where there is no hope


449
0:28:7,59 --> 0:28:12,339
whatsoever that this is going to be successful and then I am


450
0:28:12,339 --> 0:28:15,71
waiting to throwing the towel. But I know for sure that I


451
0:28:15,71 --> 0:28:19,339
have done everything I can. And after that it wasn't so


452
0:28:19,339 --> 0:28:22,789
black anymore, because now then I kind of felt good, then I


453
0:28:22,789 --> 0:28:25,689
had to cut out my plan. And what happened was that we


454
0:28:25,689 --> 0:28:30,379
actually had to get a completing your R&D team so I am


455
0:28:30,379 --> 0:28:33,859
moving the whole R&D to the US and slowly and securely we


456
0:28:33,859 --> 0:28:37,119
are able to turn around and we are able to get a


457
0:28:37,119 --> 0:28:39,369
breakthroughs that we were hoping for three years later.


458
0:28:39,369 --> 0:28:45,49
Alright, I have done everything I can that's it. I am


459
0:28:45,49 --> 0:28:46,49
throwing it the towel.


460
0:28:46,49 --> 0:28:49,519
That was very close at that point, right. But I decided that


461
0:28:49,519 --> 0:28:52,649
okay whatever it takes this is the moment I am willing to


462
0:28:52,649 --> 0:28:57,47
spend. This is how far I am willing to push it and I was


463
0:28:57,47 --> 0:29:0,79
thinking about selling lots of things I had and whatever you


464
0:29:0,79 --> 0:29:3,509
know I am willing to bring it to this point. I once I had


465
0:29:3,509 --> 0:29:6,73
that made that mental decision I was kind of ready to go and


466
0:29:6,73 --> 0:29:8,529
then it wasn't that black anymore.


467
0:29:8,529 --> 0:29:12,199
I think the flip side of that is I think a lot of people


468
0:29:12,199 --> 0:29:15,199
when they are walking to what they want to do they are


469
0:29:15,199 --> 0:29:17,949
walking with fear and they are walking with fear. So you


470
0:29:17,949 --> 0:29:20,949
know they are basically saying okay I got this great idea, I


471
0:29:20,949 --> 0:29:24,449
want to go and work on it and then they are spending 80% to


472
0:29:24,449 --> 0:29:27,449
90% of their energy on the fact that it's going to fail


473
0:29:27,449 --> 0:29:30,199
already, versus that 10% okay maybe it won't fail, right. So


474
0:29:30,199 --> 0:29:33,449
I think it's great when you can go and set aside okay this


475
0:29:33,449 --> 0:29:37,199
is my plan and this is my point of how far I am going to


476
0:29:37,199 --> 0:29:41,199
take it and I am going to give them my all and I am going to


477
0:29:41,199 --> 0:29:44,199
spend that 100% of my time in making it happen. The flipside


478
0:29:44,199 --> 0:29:47,199
of that is that when you haven't even started it, when you


479
0:29:47,199 --> 0:29:50,199
have nothing to even go ahead and do it and you are


480
0:29:50,199 --> 0:29:52,449
consuming yourself with all this negative energy where you


481
0:29:52,449 --> 0:29:56,199
are like oh my God, I am going to fail and if I fail my


482
0:29:56,199 --> 0:29:59,199
family is going to think this, my friends are going to think


483
0:29:59,199 --> 0:30:1,949
this and I think that's really where when you starting off


484
0:30:1,949 --> 0:30:4,949
as an entrepreneur, you have a clear head on that and just


485
0:30:4,949 --> 0:30:7,949
walking that failure is not an option and you are going to


486
0:30:7,949 --> 0:30:9,699
give it your all from day one.


487
0:30:9,699 --> 0:30:12,199
Actually, I think that's one of the big characteristics of


488
0:30:12,199 --> 0:30:14,199
really successful entrepreneur is that they actually never


489
0:30:14,199 --> 0:30:15,919
recognize that they could fail.


490
0:30:15,919 --> 0:30:16,909
It's part stubborn and part emission.


491
0:30:16,909 --> 0:30:17,909
Yeah.


492
0:30:17,909 --> 0:30:21,359
Yeah I have a feeling that


493
0:30:21,359 --> 0:30:23,9
[inaudible] was never actually going to reach that point


494
0:30:23,9 --> 0:30:27,47
where he said you know I have done.


495
0:30:27,47 --> 0:30:30,179
No, there was no money left you know there was nothing left,


496
0:30:30,179 --> 0:30:32,39
right.


497
0:30:32,39 --> 0:30:33,73
I would go raise more money.


498
0:30:33,73 --> 0:30:37,49
Every great entrepreneur that I ever worked with when they


499
0:30:37,49 --> 0:30:40,49
hit that point somehow managed to go find more money.


500
0:30:40,49 --> 0:30:44,97
Exactly. Alright you know just because maybe I don't know if


501
0:30:44,97 --> 0:30:48,22
I have seen more black days than anybody else but boy I have


502
0:30:48,22 --> 0:30:51,47
seen my share. And over time I have actually come to look at


503
0:30:51,47 --> 0:30:53,319
them as opportunities, leadership opportunities you know you


504
0:30:53,319 --> 0:30:56,75
can, you know everybody looks at you the leader of the


505
0:30:56,75 --> 0:31:0,279
company and everybody is down and you know they are looking


506
0:31:0,279 --> 0:31:4,179
at you and you are down. But it's an opportunity to say let'


507
0:31:4,179 --> 0:31:6,929
s do something, let's take action and let's you know create


508
0:31:6,929 --> 0:31:11,0
a plan and if you prevail you actually build tremendous


509
0:31:11,0 --> 0:31:13,909
bonds in that leadership team and the team inside the


510
0:31:13,909 --> 0:31:18,74
company. So if you can kind of step out of the blackness


511
0:31:18,74 --> 0:31:21,209
just for a moment and say is there an opportunity here there


512
0:31:21,209 --> 0:31:24,659
really actually is, I mean that's one of the things I have


513
0:31:24,659 --> 0:31:29,879
seen. But keying off of Carol's comment, the next question I


514
0:31:29,879 --> 0:31:35,49
had was what are the characteristics of an entrepreneur and


515
0:31:35,49 --> 0:31:38,73
I mean there are many I mean I certainly have, as I teach


516
0:31:38,73 --> 0:31:42,359
this as a subject matter and I have come up with a list of


517
0:31:42,359 --> 0:31:45,109
20-40 different words of that what do you think of the


518
0:31:45,109 --> 0:31:49,159
characteristics that are essential to the character of an


519
0:31:49,159 --> 0:31:56,29
entrepreneur?


520
0:31:56,29 --> 0:31:57,29
[Informal Talk]


521
0:31:57,29 --> 0:32:0,109
So I think the details are actually a very little bit by


522
0:32:0,109 --> 0:32:5,48
market but to abstract out from that to what some of we all


523
0:32:5,48 --> 0:32:10,599
have been talking about I think that the most important


524
0:32:10,599 --> 0:32:15,179
thing is that it's something that comes from passion for


525
0:32:15,179 --> 0:32:18,329
whatever it is that you are doing, whatever it is you are


526
0:32:18,329 --> 0:32:20,829
building, whatever it is you are making, whatever problem it


527
0:32:20,829 --> 0:32:23,579
is you are solving, whatever new thing it is you are


528
0:32:23,579 --> 0:32:26,329
bringing into the world that can manifest itself in lots of


529
0:32:26,329 --> 0:32:29,409
different place. There are a few people out there for whom


530
0:32:29,409 --> 0:32:34,599
that passion is actually the act of entrepreneurship and


531
0:32:34,599 --> 0:32:37,679
those are people who I think generally are called serial


532
0:32:37,679 --> 0:32:41,25
entrepreneurs. But for those people it really is like


533
0:32:41,25 --> 0:32:43,469
entrepreneurship itself is the thing that they are


534
0:32:43,469 --> 0:32:46,449
passionate about. Some people like that a lot of people who


535
0:32:46,449 --> 0:32:48,699
are great entrepreneurs aren't really like that and don't


536
0:32:48,699 --> 0:32:51,99
even necessarily sort of self-identify as entrepreneurs and


537
0:32:51,99 --> 0:32:54,99
just self-identify as yeah I am doing this thing you know


538
0:32:54,99 --> 0:32:57,349
it's just this thing that you know not that even I want to


539
0:32:57,349 --> 0:33:1,349
do is just like this is just what I do. I do this, I have to


540
0:33:1,349 --> 0:33:4,849
do this. And so I do think the details very little bit by


541
0:33:4,849 --> 0:33:7,759
market but the best abstraction that I can or the best


542
0:33:7,759 --> 0:33:12,79
example template that I can think of for that particularly


543
0:33:12,79 --> 0:33:16,49
for the areas that I focus on is Martin Luther. That's sort


544
0:33:16,49 --> 0:33:18,509
of the template that I always hold off for somebody who is a


545
0:33:18,509 --> 0:33:21,319
great entrepreneur. The reason that I say Martin Luther in


546
0:33:21,319 --> 0:33:24,799
particular is you need to sort of be you know just a little


547
0:33:24,799 --> 0:33:31,319
bit crazy, completely convicted that you know your idea and


548
0:33:31,319 --> 0:33:35,509
your way is the way the world needs to go but not sort of to


549
0:33:35,509 --> 0:33:40,789
the point of rationality and self destruction. You know


550
0:33:40,789 --> 0:33:44,689
there is a difference between somebody who is an evangelist


551
0:33:44,689 --> 0:33:49,379
and a creator and somebody who is a martyr. And you know I


552
0:33:49,379 --> 0:33:52,69
hear people talk about you know Joan of Arc as an


553
0:33:52,69 --> 0:33:55,139
entrepreneurial architect sometimes. I would argue that's a


554
0:33:55,139 --> 0:33:59,119
little too much martyr than a little too little impact. So


555
0:33:59,119 --> 0:34:1,719
you know getting the balance in that right is very tricky


556
0:34:1,719 --> 0:34:7,719
but it's that just conviction that's completely transcended


557
0:34:7,719 --> 0:34:12,239
to everything and is just something that the person does,


558
0:34:12,239 --> 0:34:17,289
must do so just you know it is what it is that's sort of the


559
0:34:17,289 --> 0:34:21,49
architect in my mind.


560
0:34:21,49 --> 0:34:24,71
I think one characteristic you got to swallow really-really


561
0:34:24,71 --> 0:34:29,59
hard is you got to embrace rejection and sometimes it is the


562
0:34:29,59 --> 0:34:32,259
hardest thing to do as a human being. But if you can swallow


563
0:34:32,259 --> 0:34:36,119
it and understand how to you know deal with it, you are


564
0:34:36,119 --> 0:34:39,119
going to probably solve 80% of your problems. And I mean if


565
0:34:39,119 --> 0:34:42,569
you just look at my career path nobody wanted to fund me


566
0:34:42,569 --> 0:34:45,589
like quick agents. I was doing millions of dollars of


567
0:34:45,589 --> 0:34:48,539
revenue and millions of dollars of profit but nobody wanted


568
0:34:48,539 --> 0:34:53,329
to fund me because I wasn't part of the dotcom Euphoria and


569
0:34:53,329 --> 0:34:56,5
in the way things looked all these back in the heyday. And


570
0:34:56,5 --> 0:34:59,909
then a BlueLithium I had three different venture capitalists


571
0:34:59,909 --> 0:35:5,69
pool away from doing a deal with me at the last minute. So


572
0:35:5,69 --> 0:35:8,0
imagine like doing HiFis with your employees and realizing


573
0:35:8,0 --> 0:35:11,0
oh we are going to get millions of dollars in for the


574
0:35:11,0 --> 0:35:13,75
company and then getting it pulled. I even had one very


575
0:35:13,75 --> 0:35:17,61
famous venture firm in the valley told me that I was going


576
0:35:17,61 --> 0:35:21,299
to miserably fail at BlueLithium and then I should listen to


577
0:35:21,299 --> 0:35:23,989
them and you know divert my attention to something that's


578
0:35:23,989 --> 0:35:28,739
actually going to work. And I wonder where he is now. But I


579
0:35:28,739 --> 0:35:31,989
would love to have a drink with him. But you know if you


580
0:35:31,989 --> 0:35:35,239
look at that and then just kind of look at even you know


581
0:35:35,239 --> 0:35:38,539
other industries you know look at garment that you know the


582
0:35:38,539 --> 0:35:42,139
founder of that company tried 88 times till we get an


583
0:35:42,139 --> 0:35:45,219
investor to actually say yes. And then if you look at J K


584
0:35:45,219 --> 0:35:50,71
Rowling as an author so most respected, she is a billionaire


585
0:35:50,71 --> 0:35:55,179
author and she got rejected seven times from her first book.


586
0:35:55,179 --> 0:35:59,659
So all that comes down to the human nature of realizing what


587
0:35:59,659 --> 0:36:3,569
your pain tolerance is for embracing rejection and so long


588
0:36:3,569 --> 0:36:7,509
as you can grow a fix skin, drawn out the noise and focus on


589
0:36:7,509 --> 0:36:13,679
that objective I mean you will prevail.


590
0:36:13,679 --> 0:36:18,119
I think yeah the way I look at an entrepreneur is really


591
0:36:18,119 --> 0:36:21,949
that entrepreneurship is really a way to express yourself.


592
0:36:21,949 --> 0:36:26,19
In the same way an artist is creating or painting a painting


593
0:36:26,19 --> 0:36:30,38
or composer writes music I think fundamentally an


594
0:36:30,38 --> 0:36:33,789
entrepreneur creates a company that's a great organization


595
0:36:33,789 --> 0:36:40,63
in a way to express himself or herself. And so there is an


596
0:36:40,63 --> 0:36:43,429
underlying passion and there is an underlying desire to


597
0:36:43,429 --> 0:36:48,73
contribute in some way, to get their voice heard add to the


598
0:36:48,73 --> 0:36:53,559
world or make the world in that tiny way a little better.


599
0:36:53,559 --> 0:36:57,94
And I think that perhaps there are three qualities that I


600
0:36:57,94 --> 0:37:1,829
would on the top of my head think of that is important


601
0:37:1,829 --> 0:37:7,299
qualities and I think one is I think they are optimistic. If


602
0:37:7,299 --> 0:37:11,579
you see the world through a positive lens every person you


603
0:37:11,579 --> 0:37:16,559
meet is a potential partner or an employee or a pursuant


604
0:37:16,559 --> 0:37:19,829
client, right. And if you have been negative perspective


605
0:37:19,829 --> 0:37:23,849
every person you meet is a competitor or there is an


606
0:37:23,849 --> 0:37:28,13
obstacle towards your success. So how that positive mindset


607
0:37:28,13 --> 0:37:31,69
I think is hugely important because then you see the


608
0:37:31,69 --> 0:37:35,19
opportunities that comes your way that you perhaps didn't


609
0:37:35,19 --> 0:37:38,96
even think about initially. The second one is the same thing


610
0:37:38,96 --> 0:37:43,119
as GE was talking about the ability to absorb rejections,


611
0:37:43,119 --> 0:37:48,67
the ability to absorb disappointments, setbacks because it


612
0:37:48,67 --> 0:37:52,69
is going to be a long way, it is going to be way where we


613
0:37:52,69 --> 0:37:55,69
have a lot of setbacks and to withstand that I think is


614
0:37:55,69 --> 0:37:57,259
essential to be successful as an entrepreneur. And perhaps


615
0:37:57,259 --> 0:38:4,799
this last thing is a way to impact people around you because


616
0:38:4,799 --> 0:38:9,769
as an entrepreneur typically you have to create a phenomenal


617
0:38:9,769 --> 0:38:13,469
team around you for the company to be successful. And you


618
0:38:13,469 --> 0:38:17,13
don't need to be the delight of the party you don't need to


619
0:38:17,13 --> 0:38:19,63
have phenomenal people skills but at least there is


620
0:38:19,63 --> 0:38:23,0
something with you that you are able to inspire all the


621
0:38:23,0 --> 0:38:25,94
people perhaps you are the best developer that you are


622
0:38:25,94 --> 0:38:29,23
extremely passionate about what you do or you had this


623
0:38:29,23 --> 0:38:33,19
strong conviction that other people see, they like and they


624
0:38:33,19 --> 0:38:36,789
want to follow you. So I think there is an element of having


625
0:38:36,789 --> 0:38:40,619
ability to do influence and attract and inspire all the


626
0:38:40,619 --> 0:38:44,739
people as a key ingredient in that so being positive


627
0:38:44,739 --> 0:38:51,46
absorbing rejections and affecting people in one way or


628
0:38:51,46 --> 0:38:52,46
another.


629
0:38:52,46 --> 0:38:53,21
ay or another.


630
0:38:53,21 --> 0:38:54,909
Caroline you may have been there.


631
0:38:54,909 --> 0:38:59,71
The one thing I want to just schedule is conversation and in


632
0:38:59,71 --> 0:39:3,9
my mind there is a gigantic difference between an inventor


633
0:39:3,9 --> 0:39:11,679
and an entrepreneur. And in Silicon Valley we tend to blend


634
0:39:11,679 --> 0:39:17,139
the two. And I think that's a big mistake. There are lots of


635
0:39:17,139 --> 0:39:23,589
people who can create interesting technologies but they can'


636
0:39:23,589 --> 0:39:30,289
t deliver and so for me the entrepreneurship part shows up


637
0:39:30,289 --> 0:39:40,759
in their ability to deliver and that's a very vague term but


638
0:39:40,759 --> 0:39:44,949
anybody who has been an entrepreneur will understand that


639
0:39:44,949 --> 0:39:47,219
that is where the rubber hits the road.


640
0:39:47,219 --> 0:39:50,639
It's a great plan and I think and a lot of where that


641
0:39:50,639 --> 0:39:53,519
delivery happens just as your status is around people,


642
0:39:53,519 --> 0:39:57,539
people, people, the people you can rally to work with you


643
0:39:57,539 --> 0:40:1,269
and help you, the people who you can inspire who are going


644
0:40:1,269 --> 0:40:3,96
to be your customers or your users or your other


645
0:40:3,96 --> 0:40:6,349
constituents that are going to inspire to invest in you


646
0:40:6,349 --> 0:40:11,29
exactly that ability to not just create something but to


647
0:40:11,29 --> 0:40:14,969
inspire others with your creation I think is the thing that


648
0:40:14,969 --> 0:40:17,219
propels you forward from


649
0:40:17,219 --> 0:40:19,609
[inaudible] ideation actually succeeding.


650
0:40:19,609 --> 0:40:22,739
I think entrepreneurship is kind of like an art and there


651
0:40:22,739 --> 0:40:25,489
are probably three stages of it and I am in that


652
0:40:25,489 --> 0:40:27,739
wholeheartedly. There is probably the first stage where you


653
0:40:27,739 --> 0:40:31,539
are the creator and you the inventor and you are trying to


654
0:40:31,539 --> 0:40:34,279
proof of concept, the second stage is you are the manager


655
0:40:34,279 --> 0:40:36,909
you are actually trying to go ahead and scale the company,


656
0:40:36,909 --> 0:40:39,659
you are actually trying to build, you are actually trying to


657
0:40:39,659 --> 0:40:42,909
go ahead and prosper in that regard and the last part is you


658
0:40:42,909 --> 0:40:45,159
are the executor, you are actually executing against a


659
0:40:45,159 --> 0:40:48,279
potential outcome and that itself is a different strategy.


660
0:40:48,279 --> 0:40:52,109
So all three require a completely different approach and it'


661
0:40:52,109 --> 0:40:55,359
s up to you as an entrepreneur to see if you can mould


662
0:40:55,359 --> 0:40:58,359
yourself as a company grows so you know exactly how to go


663
0:40:58,359 --> 0:41:1,89
ahead and act. You can't act like the creator when you


664
0:41:1,89 --> 0:41:3,839
already had a company that's already doing a $100 million in


665
0:41:3,839 --> 0:41:7,25
revenue. And you try to go ahead and have a potential exit,


666
0:41:7,25 --> 0:41:11,969
you got to be a completely different CEO. So partly it's you


667
0:41:11,969 --> 0:41:14,92
know the problem that I see in most entrepreneurs is that


668
0:41:14,92 --> 0:41:17,989
they get way too emotional with certain things whether that


669
0:41:17,989 --> 0:41:21,5
is owning certain amounts or controlling certain amounts but


670
0:41:21,5 --> 0:41:23,519
I think the best thing about being an entrepreneur is being


671
0:41:23,519 --> 0:41:27,21
able to adapt to different changes that you are able to do


672
0:41:27,21 --> 0:41:29,88
in the various stages of entrepreneurs.


673
0:41:29,88 --> 0:41:32,949
And on the other hand though, I want to make sure that


674
0:41:32,949 --> 0:41:35,909
people are clear about the fact that entrepreneur does not


675
0:41:35,909 --> 0:41:40,38
necessarily mean founder, I mean there are lots of people


676
0:41:40,38 --> 0:41:45,67
that were extraordinarily entrepreneurial at Google or at


677
0:41:45,67 --> 0:41:51,409
Intuit or at Cisco and at Yahoo, I mean pick the company, I


678
0:41:51,409 --> 0:41:57,489
mean being entrepreneurial is a state of mind, it isn't you


679
0:41:57,489 --> 0:42:1,139
know the fact that you are the founder.


680
0:42:1,139 --> 0:42:8,89
How do you in this character issue, how do you feel about


681
0:42:8,89 --> 0:42:11,509
you know risk seeking risk avoidance kind of thing that a


682
0:42:11,509 --> 0:42:16,389
lot of people describe by entrepreneurs as risk seeking, how


683
0:42:16,389 --> 0:42:19,809
would you comment on that?


684
0:42:19,809 --> 0:42:26,67
So I think your ability to live in a risky environment is


685
0:42:26,67 --> 0:42:33,759
pretty important as an entrepreneur. You know that the whole


686
0:42:33,759 --> 0:42:39,219
concept of you know can you sleep at night, becomes a big


687
0:42:39,219 --> 0:42:44,19
one and if you are going to put your health at risk being an


688
0:42:44,19 --> 0:42:51,15
entrepreneur probably isn't the right thing for you. And you


689
0:42:51,15 --> 0:42:55,98
know there are times in your life where you can't afford to


690
0:42:55,98 --> 0:42:59,19
take a risk, you have too many other individuals in your


691
0:42:59,19 --> 0:43:6,909
life that are depending on you. And so I think there is some


692
0:43:6,909 --> 0:43:12,39
you know kind of reality checks that you need to have about


693
0:43:12,39 --> 0:43:19,529
your risk levels. Having said that most of the entrepreneurs


694
0:43:19,529 --> 0:43:23,449
that have been incredibly successful are the ones who took


695
0:43:23,449 --> 0:43:29,329
risk at extremely inappropriate times in their lives and so


696
0:43:29,329 --> 0:43:32,809
rotate a mass point you set a rule down and somebody is


697
0:43:32,809 --> 0:43:38,96
going to think of an exception to it. But risk, being


698
0:43:38,96 --> 0:43:42,429
willing to live with risk is a big one.


699
0:43:42,429 --> 0:43:45,579
That's a big distinction. The distinction between being okay


700
0:43:45,579 --> 0:43:49,599
living with risk, being risk tolerant and being risk seeking


701
0:43:49,599 --> 0:43:53,67
you know I think it's kind of crazy to be risk seeking per


702
0:43:53,67 --> 0:43:58,629
se I think great entrepreneurs tend to be change seeking and


703
0:43:58,629 --> 0:44:2,239
when you are trying to change things risk is inherently


704
0:44:2,239 --> 0:44:6,599
apart of the process. You have to be okay with that, but


705
0:44:6,599 --> 0:44:10,19
people who sort of seek out risk for the sake of seeking out


706
0:44:10,19 --> 0:44:15,23
risk maybe you get lucky but that doesn't seem like the way


707
0:44:15,23 --> 0:44:16,809
to make things happen to me.


708
0:44:16,809 --> 0:44:21,21
Actually you know in many cases I think especially when they


709
0:44:21,21 --> 0:44:24,21
are starting up the company you don't see the risk, I mean


710
0:44:24,21 --> 0:44:28,67
you are so clear about your vision of the future that to


711
0:44:28,67 --> 0:44:32,4
Gee's point failure isn't an option.


712
0:44:32,4 --> 0:44:33,69
Blinded by the vision.


713
0:44:33,69 --> 0:44:38,849
But I don't agree with that you know because a lot of times


714
0:44:38,849 --> 0:44:41,349
when you talk about entrepreneurship a lot of people talk


715
0:44:41,349 --> 0:44:45,449
about the risk, with taking risk. And there is nothing that


716
0:44:45,449 --> 0:44:48,59
rubs me the wrong way because I don't think necessarily


717
0:44:48,59 --> 0:44:51,579
entrepreneurs are taking risk at least I don't look at


718
0:44:51,579 --> 0:44:54,129
myself as taking risk, on the contrary I feel like I


719
0:44:54,129 --> 0:44:57,92
continuously try to minimize risk, but what they do try to


720
0:44:57,92 --> 0:45:1,929
do is pursue opportune as I say that I don't look at myself


721
0:45:1,929 --> 0:45:4,889
as a risk taker. I am willing to live with risk and willing


722
0:45:4,889 --> 0:45:9,949
to tolerate to live with risk, but I am not a risk taker. I


723
0:45:9,949 --> 0:45:15,789
minimize risk for whatever ability I am capable of doing you


724
0:45:15,789 --> 0:45:18,289
know so it's more I think it's a being distinction.


725
0:45:18,289 --> 0:45:23,319
But in reality the fact that you are willing to operate


726
0:45:23,319 --> 0:45:28,71
without a net by definition and I think it moves you into


727
0:45:28,71 --> 0:45:31,42
the risk, you know.


728
0:45:31,42 --> 0:45:34,17
Perhaps more risky tolerant, once you say that you are at


729
0:45:34,17 --> 0:45:37,67
risk, I feel that you are stepping over a line that I am not


730
0:45:37,67 --> 0:45:39,339
comfortable associating myself.


731
0:45:39,339 --> 0:45:39,589
Right.


732
0:45:39,589 --> 0:45:42,929
Well I also think there are two types of risk that


733
0:45:42,929 --> 0:45:45,129
entrepreneurs take, I mean there are also two types of


734
0:45:45,129 --> 0:45:48,589
entrepreneurs. You know there is a type of entrepreneur that


735
0:45:48,589 --> 0:45:52,89
says okay I am going to change the world, so I am going to


736
0:45:52,89 --> 0:45:55,339
go with the crazy idea and nobody has done it before. And I


737
0:45:55,339 --> 0:45:57,839
am going to try to go ahead and prove myself right.


738
0:45:57,839 --> 0:45:58,839
I love those.


739
0:45:58,839 --> 0:46:3,829
I am not one of those. I am one of the second category which


740
0:46:3,829 --> 0:46:6,519
is basically saying okay I recognize that there is enough


741
0:46:6,519 --> 0:46:9,75
people doing this and I understand this maybe a crowded


742
0:46:9,75 --> 0:46:13,469
space, but I am going to copy exactly what they are doing


743
0:46:13,469 --> 0:46:16,909
but I am going to go ahead and catch up to them by executing


744
0:46:16,909 --> 0:46:19,909
them better and then I am going to innovate. And if you


745
0:46:19,909 --> 0:46:22,659
cannot think about that that's how majority of all of the


746
0:46:22,659 --> 0:46:24,409
successful companies in Silicon Valley have actually


747
0:46:24,409 --> 0:46:27,409
started, I mean if you look at you know kind of Friendster


748
0:46:27,409 --> 0:46:30,15
and MySpace you know MySpace was just copying Friendster but


749
0:46:30,15 --> 0:46:33,659
if it could scale, right and then if you kind of look at


750
0:46:33,659 --> 0:46:36,469
MySpace and Facebook, yeah it's very different now but it


751
0:46:36,469 --> 0:46:40,579
had the same functionalities at a certain point too. And you


752
0:46:40,579 --> 0:46:43,839
know that's really where I think the my recommendations for


753
0:46:43,839 --> 0:46:46,75
entrepreneurs is that don't put yourself I mean again I know


754
0:46:46,75 --> 0:46:50,309
you love the first category but I kind of fear that if


755
0:46:50,309 --> 0:46:53,469
people try to go ahead and prove something that haven't been


756
0:46:53,469 --> 0:46:58,789
proved before you are walking into a room that isn't hard to


757
0:46:58,789 --> 0:47:1,29
qualify you. So you know that --.


758
0:47:1,29 --> 0:47:5,75
So some of that happens with depending on industry, so I


759
0:47:5,75 --> 0:47:8,679
mean for instance the area that we have made the most amount


760
0:47:8,679 --> 0:47:12,429
of money is in medical devices,


761
0:47:12,429 --> 0:47:15,9
[inaudible]. And the reason why our companies have been


762
0:47:15,9 --> 0:47:19,269
successful and have made us a lot of money is because they


763
0:47:19,269 --> 0:47:27,519
did something totally new and different and so I mean you


764
0:47:27,519 --> 0:47:30,46
know I think there is room for both.


765
0:47:30,46 --> 0:47:34,679
I think there is, all I am saying is there is a lot of risk


766
0:47:34,679 --> 0:47:37,839
in putting something in a category that hasn't been proven.


767
0:47:37,839 --> 0:47:41,139
I mean just based on enough data that supports you know new


768
0:47:41,139 --> 0:47:43,609
investments that haven't been proven versus going after a


769
0:47:43,609 --> 0:47:46,859
category that is already out there and you are competing


770
0:47:46,859 --> 0:47:49,859
against it, there is always going to be a leader, there is


771
0:47:49,859 --> 0:47:52,609
always going to be an incumbent, so that means that's just


772
0:47:52,609 --> 0:47:55,859
the nature of business, all I am saying is that at least for


773
0:47:55,859 --> 0:47:59,109
me as an entrepreneur I reside in the later where I am not


774
0:47:59,109 --> 0:48:1,609
going to take that risk of coming up with something


775
0:48:1,609 --> 0:48:6,79
completely different and you know be left kind of you know


776
0:48:6,79 --> 0:48:8,69
[inaudible] in a marketplace versus kind of going in with it


777
0:48:8,69 --> 0:48:12,15
and you know replicating something and then innovating it by


778
0:48:12,15 --> 0:48:14,569
out executing them and you know after I reach to a certain


779
0:48:14,569 --> 0:48:15,569
point.


780
0:48:15,569 --> 0:48:20,21
But I think when it comes to risk, sometimes I am not sure


781
0:48:20,21 --> 0:48:23,199
if I understand all the discussion either because what are


782
0:48:23,199 --> 0:48:27,429
you risking right, there is an underlying assumption that


783
0:48:27,429 --> 0:48:30,509
there is this something specific that you are risking and I


784
0:48:30,509 --> 0:48:34,42
think that people have different aspects of what is


785
0:48:34,42 --> 0:48:37,559
worthwhile risking or what is worthwhile not risking, right


786
0:48:37,559 --> 0:48:40,99
so if you don't have a good understanding of what you are


787
0:48:40,99 --> 0:48:42,559
risking then the discussion becomes very abstract too. And


788
0:48:42,559 --> 0:48:46,89
the way I look at it is that you have a certain amount of


789
0:48:46,89 --> 0:48:50,569
time on this planet, tomorrow you can be hit by a truck and


790
0:48:50,569 --> 0:48:54,89
do I want to live my life doing something that I don't feel


791
0:48:54,89 --> 0:48:57,21
fulfilled with that's a big risk that you live the whole


792
0:48:57,21 --> 0:49:2,569
life and be miserable, right. So it depends a little bit on


793
0:49:2,569 --> 0:49:5,819
what it is that you really want to do and what you are


794
0:49:5,819 --> 0:49:10,259
willing to risk and in that perspective I think I understand


795
0:49:10,259 --> 0:49:12,409
that risk is associated with entrepreneurship but I don't


796
0:49:12,409 --> 0:49:17,809
like the notion risk is put on an entrepreneur saying that


797
0:49:17,809 --> 0:49:19,69
this person is a risk taker.


798
0:49:19,69 --> 0:49:22,589
Let me move to one more issue of this entrepreneurial


799
0:49:22,589 --> 0:49:27,629
character that I think is interesting to discuss, you know


800
0:49:27,629 --> 0:49:30,489
and my thinking over the years about what motivates


801
0:49:30,489 --> 0:49:33,73
entrepreneurs. I have kind of come with three categories


802
0:49:33,73 --> 0:49:41,349
change the world, build a great company, get rich. So what


803
0:49:41,349 --> 0:49:45,46
is the I think offer is fine, but some people are driven


804
0:49:45,46 --> 0:49:48,469
more by one than by other so how would you describe you know


805
0:49:48,469 --> 0:49:51,29
those three words for yourself in terms of how would you


806
0:49:51,29 --> 0:49:53,949
kind of slide yourself or profile yourself with those


807
0:49:53,949 --> 0:49:56,75
things. Do you think those are relevant to entrepreneurial


808
0:49:56,75 --> 0:49:59,129
motivation?


809
0:49:59,129 --> 0:50:2,769
I mean I would say, I mean I never did anything for the


810
0:50:2,769 --> 0:50:6,119
money and I think that anybody that walks into an


811
0:50:6,119 --> 0:50:9,779
entrepreneurship endeavor to get rich has already failed.


812
0:50:9,779 --> 0:50:14,639
And I mean monetary exits cash that you make is really comes


813
0:50:14,639 --> 0:50:17,629
after all of the hard work and you can't even think about


814
0:50:17,629 --> 0:50:21,129
that from day one and if the minute you do you are going to


815
0:50:21,129 --> 0:50:23,629
start making you know short-term decisions that are going to


816
0:50:23,629 --> 0:50:26,129
go ahead and effect your business decisions that you should


817
0:50:26,129 --> 0:50:29,99
be making so for me it's always been about being successful


818
0:50:29,99 --> 0:50:32,429
and improving myself that I can do it again and that I know


819
0:50:32,429 --> 0:50:35,0
the formula and so long as I know the formula I want to


820
0:50:35,0 --> 0:50:38,699
challenge myself for the next opportunity. And you know sure


821
0:50:38,699 --> 0:50:40,949
the money that comes along, it's like keeping score but


822
0:50:40,949 --> 0:50:41,949
that's about it.


823
0:50:41,949 --> 0:50:48,599
I think that changed the world idea we are very - on that


824
0:50:48,599 --> 0:50:51,25
like for me the way I would articulate it personally is sort


825
0:50:51,25 --> 0:50:54,819
of you know be involved with the most interesting things I


826
0:50:54,819 --> 0:51:1,879
can be involved with is that's it. And all of the best


827
0:51:1,879 --> 0:51:6,19
entrepreneurs I know tend to look at the building of a great


828
0:51:6,19 --> 0:51:10,469
company and the making of a lot of money as means to the end


829
0:51:10,469 --> 0:51:12,719
of accomplishing the goal that they are trying to


830
0:51:12,719 --> 0:51:15,469
accomplish. You know the idea that I want this to be


831
0:51:15,469 --> 0:51:19,279
structured as a company because a company is the best


832
0:51:19,279 --> 0:51:22,679
vehicle to accomplish what it is that I am trying to


833
0:51:22,679 --> 0:51:25,429
accomplish. If they were a better vehicle I would use that


834
0:51:25,429 --> 0:51:28,429
other vehicle on set, but this is the best vehicle so that's


835
0:51:28,429 --> 0:51:31,179
what I am going to do. That's the mentality that resonates


836
0:51:31,179 --> 0:51:34,679
most with me and I think you know can get you to the biggest


837
0:51:34,679 --> 0:51:38,829
and most exciting questions.


838
0:51:38,829 --> 0:51:43,9
I think changing the world is such a big term but I think


839
0:51:43,9 --> 0:51:47,879
definitely there is a part of me that trips so I have to


840
0:51:47,879 --> 0:51:53,46
contribute somehow and my different way, so I think and the


841
0:51:53,46 --> 0:51:55,969
reason why I think that is important because I think


842
0:51:55,969 --> 0:51:58,71
everyone is looking for some kind of meaningful purpose we


843
0:51:58,71 --> 0:52:2,21
are able to do that you actually see that what you do has a


844
0:52:2,21 --> 0:52:5,829
positive effect. And that I think is an important part of my


845
0:52:5,829 --> 0:52:10,94
drive. In addition to that I think it is going back to what


846
0:52:10,94 --> 0:52:13,44
I told previously, working with people that you really care


847
0:52:13,44 --> 0:52:15,69
about, working with people that you are really passionate


848
0:52:15,69 --> 0:52:18,46
about, and indirectly that it's really building an


849
0:52:18,46 --> 0:52:24,519
organization that you take pride in.


850
0:52:24,519 --> 0:52:31,19
I think the kind of the core motivation in where the company


851
0:52:31,19 --> 0:52:35,329
is in its growth process is going to motivate where the


852
0:52:35,329 --> 0:52:41,629
money sources are coming from and so if you are trying to


853
0:52:41,629 --> 0:52:48,859
change the world but there is no clear path to making money,


854
0:52:48,859 --> 0:52:52,759
the type of investor that you are going to attract is going


855
0:52:52,759 --> 0:52:58,359
to be very different then when you come in and say you know


856
0:52:58,359 --> 0:53:3,599
here is the plan. I am going to do this. This is going to


857
0:53:3,599 --> 0:53:6,599
happen and you are going to get your money back in three


858
0:53:6,599 --> 0:53:11,869
years at x percentage. Having heard that speech a lot of


859
0:53:11,869 --> 0:53:15,889
time I never believe it but the point is that it attracts a


860
0:53:15,889 --> 0:53:24,369
different type of investor and so part of the game and one


861
0:53:24,369 --> 0:53:28,509
of the things that craters any startup is not being properly


862
0:53:28,509 --> 0:53:33,599
capitalized. And so part of the game is figuring out where


863
0:53:33,599 --> 0:53:43,39
are the right pockets of money for your startup. And I think


864
0:53:43,39 --> 0:53:46,849
you needed to understand when do you need to attract money


865
0:53:46,849 --> 0:53:50,879
because of passion, when do you need to attract money out of


866
0:53:50,879 --> 0:53:59,549
greed and where do you need to attract money out of the


867
0:53:59,549 --> 0:54:5,199
philosophy of building a bigger stronger company.


868
0:54:5,199 --> 0:54:9,949
So one of the questions I think is to generally for students


869
0:54:9,949 --> 0:54:13,929
that I teach is where do great ideas, great insights come


870
0:54:13,929 --> 0:54:25,399
from and if you are willing to share what's hot now.


871
0:54:25,399 --> 0:54:29,839
I would say social gaming and social media is probably from


872
0:54:29,839 --> 0:54:34,989
a sector probably one of the interesting sectors that I see


873
0:54:34,989 --> 0:54:39,9
right now, I mean something in it. But in terms of ideas and


874
0:54:39,9 --> 0:54:43,9
execution I mean part of my philosophy is that idea when we


875
0:54:43,9 --> 0:54:47,329
get it is 1% of the journey, 99% of it is all execution. So


876
0:54:47,329 --> 0:54:50,779
I know a lot of people that get wound up because they see a


877
0:54:50,779 --> 0:54:54,29
hot idea or a hot sector and you know they basically, I mean


878
0:54:54,29 --> 0:54:56,779
I even get crazy e-mails saying; "Hey I have the next


879
0:54:56,779 --> 0:54:59,579
trillion dollar idea". I don't even know if that idea exists


880
0:54:59,579 --> 0:55:2,929
but still in terms of people's mindset they think this idea


881
0:55:2,929 --> 0:55:6,769
is going to make them rich or this idea is it, that's it.


882
0:55:6,769 --> 0:55:11,119
That's 1% right there. You know 99% of how you actually see


883
0:55:11,119 --> 0:55:14,219
from starting a company, making it into something and going


884
0:55:14,219 --> 0:55:17,79
through the ups and downs that you are going to have to go


885
0:55:17,79 --> 0:55:21,529
through is really the outcome that you should focus on.


886
0:55:21,529 --> 0:55:25,589
I refuse to even answer the question because it's not what


887
0:55:25,589 --> 0:55:28,19
anybody should be thinking about if they are thinking about


888
0:55:28,19 --> 0:55:30,69
starting something. You need to be thinking about you know


889
0:55:30,69 --> 0:55:38,109
what you wish for hot tomorrow, not what's hot now. My job


890
0:55:38,109 --> 0:55:41,369
is to spot what's hot now before anybody else spots what's


891
0:55:41,369 --> 0:55:43,949
hot now. But that's a different topic, that's being a


892
0:55:43,949 --> 0:55:49,179
venture capitalist. You know the entrepreneur's job is to do


893
0:55:49,179 --> 0:55:53,67
the thing that they want to do. And so I wouldn't worry


894
0:55:53,67 --> 0:55:56,869
about what's hot now; actually the only extent to which I


895
0:55:56,869 --> 0:55:59,599
would worry about what's hot now is if you really want to do


896
0:55:59,599 --> 0:56:2,759
something and you look and you say you know this is really


897
0:56:2,759 --> 0:56:6,219
hot right now that's probably a bad sign. But beyond that


898
0:56:6,219 --> 0:56:12,149
just forget it, don't you know don't look at it as positive


899
0:56:12,149 --> 0:56:15,0
or negative, just ignore it, just ignore everything, just do


900
0:56:15,0 --> 0:56:20,49
what you want to do.


901
0:56:20,49 --> 0:56:22,799
I strongly support what you are saying. I totally agree and


902
0:56:22,799 --> 0:56:25,799
I think that's, sometimes it's a little bit of a fever that


903
0:56:25,799 --> 0:56:30,73
we are chasing what is hot and I think that is a big mistake


904
0:56:30,73 --> 0:56:33,649
you do that you try to come up with something that is hot.


905
0:56:33,649 --> 0:56:35,849
It must be something that you are passionate about. It must


906
0:56:35,849 --> 0:56:38,929
be something that you can really see that this will have an


907
0:56:38,929 --> 0:56:43,739
impact, that this will really create value and where to


908
0:56:43,739 --> 0:56:48,19
look, you know. I have no idea really but I love internet. I


909
0:56:48,19 --> 0:56:51,279
think internet is fantastic and particularly when you think


910
0:56:51,279 --> 0:56:54,589
about combined that with mobile phones. And I think that


911
0:56:54,589 --> 0:56:57,509
some people say that old innovational internet is down. Some


912
0:56:57,509 --> 0:57:1,259
people say that social media and social network is the last


913
0:57:1,259 --> 0:57:3,989
big innovation of internet, I don't think that's true


914
0:57:3,989 --> 0:57:6,46
whatsoever. I mean yeah the first generation that grew up


915
0:57:6,46 --> 0:57:12,89
with computers, internet has just come up in the last few


916
0:57:12,89 --> 0:57:16,409
years. Social media didn't come nice too until one year ago.


917
0:57:16,409 --> 0:57:19,669
So within that space there are just phenomenal and


918
0:57:19,669 --> 0:57:23,5
phenomenal opportunities to come with innovative products


919
0:57:23,5 --> 0:57:27,299
and services and I am sure that we have just scratched the


920
0:57:27,299 --> 0:57:34,519
surface of what we are going to see going forward.


921
0:57:34,519 --> 0:57:39,769
You know I think there are so many problems in the world and


922
0:57:39,769 --> 0:57:44,369
you know kind of the core areas that tend to trigger people'


923
0:57:44,369 --> 0:57:49,259
s passion is that they are trying to solve a problem or they


924
0:57:49,259 --> 0:57:59,299
are fantasizing a different world. So you know current state


925
0:57:59,299 --> 0:58:2,799
of the transportation industry drives me nuts, anybody who


926
0:58:2,799 --> 0:58:9,539
can do Beam me up, Scotty, I am like so there. You know I am


927
0:58:9,539 --> 0:58:15,879
concerned about health and I know that there are like


928
0:58:15,879 --> 0:58:22,39
several core things that I need to do, exercise and sleep


929
0:58:22,39 --> 0:58:26,509
and what I eat are the three you know big things that will


930
0:58:26,509 --> 0:58:31,589
impact my health. So anybody that can make that easier or


931
0:58:31,589 --> 0:58:34,629
simpler and you know I can eat anything I want and never put


932
0:58:34,629 --> 0:58:39,49
on a pound would be fabulous. I mean you know you could, I


933
0:58:39,49 --> 0:58:42,419
mean you start working through you know what's wrong in the


934
0:58:42,419 --> 0:58:45,159
world, where are the big problems, where are the big trends,


935
0:58:45,159 --> 0:58:50,379
I mean we have a huge bunch of people that are crossing the


936
0:58:50,379 --> 0:58:57,469
50-year-old line and the world is different when you are 50.


937
0:58:57,469 --> 0:59:4,0
And so how do we meet those needs. We have a younger


938
0:59:4,0 --> 0:59:9,269
generation that is moving into a global world not a village


939
0:59:9,269 --> 0:59:17,489
world. How does that impact? I mean pick an area and you can


940
0:59:17,489 --> 0:59:19,589
discover that there are problems and the minute you


941
0:59:19,589 --> 0:59:23,769
discovered the problem you start fantasizing about how to


942
0:59:23,769 --> 0:59:27,69
solve it and bingo.


943
0:59:27,69 --> 0:59:30,329
You know people talk about this idea of changing the world a


944
0:59:30,329 --> 0:59:33,579
lot. I think a lot of the times what they really mean is


945
0:59:33,579 --> 0:59:39,919
changing your world you know. The really great things that


946
0:59:39,919 --> 0:59:44,549
people create and build and turn into big companies, I think


947
0:59:44,549 --> 0:59:49,309
they usually come from very personal places. And so you know


948
0:59:49,309 --> 0:59:52,639
you have to sort of find what's personal for you and what is


949
0:59:52,639 --> 0:59:55,889
about your life that you want to change and I think it could


950
0:59:55,889 --> 1:0:0,539
be subtle but in lots of ways that extension is the driver


951
1:0:0,539 --> 1:0:5,279
for people. When you start thinking about problems at sort


952
1:0:5,279 --> 1:0:9,549
of grand levels of abstraction I think you risk getting into


953
1:0:9,549 --> 1:0:13,349
sort of dangerously unemotional territory. This is hard,


954
1:0:13,349 --> 1:0:16,0
right, it's really hard to do this. You have to really-


955
1:0:16,0 --> 1:0:18,919
really-really want to do this all day and all night, seven


956
1:0:18,919 --> 1:0:22,719
days a week for the next, I assume it is going to take 20


957
1:0:22,719 --> 1:0:25,129
years, you know. And completely disrupt and interfere will


958
1:0:25,129 --> 1:0:28,379
then screw up the rest of your life. So it better be really-


959
1:0:28,379 --> 1:0:31,569
really-really personal. So it's great to want to change the


960
1:0:31,569 --> 1:0:34,519
world. But I think a lot of times when people talk about


961
1:0:34,519 --> 1:0:36,789
changing the world they are really talking about changing


962
1:0:36,789 --> 1:0:39,769
themselves and changing their world and changing the world


963
1:0:39,769 --> 1:0:43,75
around them. And that may sound selfish but you know


964
1:0:43,75 --> 1:0:45,949
emotions are important.


965
1:0:45,949 --> 1:0:49,759
When I talk about in class I always use the word authentic


966
1:0:49,759 --> 1:0:52,929
that there is an authenticity, the great idea has come from


967
1:0:52,929 --> 1:0:56,9
personal experience, the ability, they are happy with


968
1:0:56,9 --> 1:0:58,96
something, seeing opportunity to change it and apply that


969
1:0:58,96 --> 1:1:3,98
and that's you know that yields the ideas and what's hot now


970
1:1:3,98 --> 1:1:9,529
question which I you know always ask it's kind of like the


971
1:1:9,529 --> 1:1:11,129
[inaudible] which is you know who would want to be member of


972
1:1:11,129 --> 1:1:15,219
club that would have me and you know what's hot now if I


973
1:1:15,219 --> 1:1:18,59
knew that I would be sitting, you know I would be out doing


974
1:1:18,59 --> 1:1:21,519
it instead of even sitting here talking about it, right.


975
1:1:21,519 --> 1:1:25,429
But you know the thing that I want to make sure that at


976
1:1:25,429 --> 1:1:31,469
least I am communicating is that entrepreneurship is not


977
1:1:31,469 --> 1:1:37,79
limited to technology, entrepreneurship happens in all walks


978
1:1:37,79 --> 1:1:41,399
of life and in all business segments. And there are


979
1:1:41,399 --> 1:1:45,929
investors that will support that. We happen to have a


980
1:1:45,929 --> 1:1:49,869
particularly high concentration of technology based


981
1:1:49,869 --> 1:1:52,949
investors here in Silicon Valley but that doesn't mean that


982
1:1:52,949 --> 1:1:54,59
that is the world.


983
1:1:54,59 --> 1:1:59,309
Yeah, they built Starbucks on a great cup of coffee and


984
1:1:59,309 --> 1:2:1,319
there is nothing


985
1:2:1,319 --> 1:2:2,319
[overlapping].


986
1:2:2,319 --> 1:2:5,919
We have five minutes left, let's open it up and see if there


987
1:2:5,919 --> 1:2:7,919
are any questions from the audience for all or any


988
1:2:7,919 --> 1:2:8,919
particular panelist.


989
1:2:8,919 --> 1:2:12,319
You spoke about surrounding yourself by great people. When


990
1:2:12,319 --> 1:2:16,289
you go back sort of to startup mode, how much credibility


991
1:2:16,289 --> 1:2:20,509
behind you, not many people know you to have this what you


992
1:2:20,509 --> 1:2:23,509
think is a great idea. How do you actually hire these main


993
1:2:23,509 --> 1:2:26,339
players, like what are some practical sort of steps from the


994
1:2:26,339 --> 1:2:29,809
knowledge you know now of how you would go out and try and


995
1:2:29,809 --> 1:2:31,559
influence these people to come on board?


996
1:2:31,559 --> 1:2:35,919
There is probably, there is two categories of Rock Stars,


997
1:2:35,919 --> 1:2:39,219
there is the first category of the founding employees Sweat


998
1:2:39,219 --> 1:2:42,879
Equity Rock Star and then secondly the Rock Stars you hire


999
1:2:42,879 --> 1:2:45,899
at a second stage of the company. I think you are asking


1000
1:2:45,899 --> 1:2:48,699
about the primary stage and just a quick story on my side is


1001
1:2:48,699 --> 1:2:52,71
that when I started BlueLithium I actually found a company


1002
1:2:52,71 --> 1:2:56,949
in Belarus of all places through the internet. And you know


1003
1:2:56,949 --> 1:2:59,519
they had a great technology, I actually went down there,


1004
1:2:59,519 --> 1:3:3,349
visited them and there was a scrappy entrepreneurs building


1005
1:3:3,349 --> 1:3:7,19
code and you know in apartment building you know next to


1006
1:3:7,19 --> 1:3:10,769
about 18 different computers and I love that. I loved the


1007
1:3:10,769 --> 1:3:14,719
scrappiness, the boot scrappiness and you know when I looked


1008
1:3:14,719 --> 1:3:17,969
them in the eye and said what do you want for your company


1009
1:3:17,969 --> 1:3:20,719
and they basically said half a million dollars. And I said


1010
1:3:20,719 --> 1:3:24,219
okay how about if I can give you more than that and when I


1011
1:3:24,219 --> 1:3:28,719
can go ahead well in a different way and the way was you


1012
1:3:28,719 --> 1:3:31,309
know for them to bind to my vision of what I wanted to


1013
1:3:31,309 --> 1:3:33,799
create and you know you got to understand when you are


1014
1:3:33,799 --> 1:3:36,799
trying to look for that Rock Star you got to have people


1015
1:3:36,799 --> 1:3:39,799
that want to take that risk, and when they take that risk,


1016
1:3:39,799 --> 1:3:43,49
they are going to go ahead and you know work their ass off


1017
1:3:43,49 --> 1:3:46,299
for that and when they do they will deliver it and that risk


1018
1:3:46,299 --> 1:3:49,299
where they ended up taking a stake in my company rather than


1019
1:3:49,299 --> 1:3:51,799
for wall paper rather half a million dollars. Three years


1020
1:3:51,799 --> 1:3:54,799
later it ended up becoming $50 million for them. So when you


1021
1:3:54,799 --> 1:3:57,549
look at it from that context there are enough people out


1022
1:3:57,549 --> 1:4:0,299
there that are hungry, it's not that many but there is


1023
1:4:0,299 --> 1:4:3,49
enough out there and when you can find them you know


1024
1:4:3,49 --> 1:4:5,49
everybody is after the same journey. Everybody is after the


1025
1:4:5,49 --> 1:4:6,49
same goal.


1026
1:4:6,49 --> 1:4:9,839
I totally agree with a lot of that. One thing that I want to


1027
1:4:9,839 --> 1:4:12,899
amplify and give a little bit different view on is, there


1028
1:4:12,899 --> 1:4:17,219
are lots of different ways to be hungry. And some of the


1029
1:4:17,219 --> 1:4:20,109
ways to be hungry can be very destructive for your company.


1030
1:4:20,109 --> 1:4:22,889
Some of the ways people will be can be incredibly powerful


1031
1:4:22,889 --> 1:4:27,929
for your company. I think you really want to find people not


1032
1:4:27,929 --> 1:4:31,59
who are a low ego which is what people always talk about but


1033
1:4:31,59 --> 1:4:35,779
rather who have a strong ego and a desire to supplement that


1034
1:4:35,779 --> 1:4:40,509
completely into what it is that the company is doing which


1035
1:4:40,509 --> 1:4:44,0
is a different thing but is very important distinction. So


1036
1:4:44,0 --> 1:4:48,299
how do you that, you have to be really careful to find


1037
1:4:48,299 --> 1:4:53,539
people who are you know no one will ever be as deeply


1038
1:4:53,539 --> 1:4:56,23
passionate about what the company is making as the founder


1039
1:4:56,23 --> 1:4:58,969
perhaps but you need to find people who are really-really


1040
1:4:58,969 --> 1:5:2,889
passionate about what the company is doing as opposed to the


1041
1:5:2,889 --> 1:5:6,89
fact that the company is hot or the company is you know in a


1042
1:5:6,89 --> 1:5:8,339
interesting space or the company has funding from good


1043
1:5:8,339 --> 1:5:11,659
investors or whatever. That's hard to do. I think there are


1044
1:5:11,659 --> 1:5:14,71
some tactical ways you can do it. You know some of the


1045
1:5:14,71 --> 1:5:19,21
companies I have been involved with we have had people take


1046
1:5:19,21 --> 1:5:22,719
title deflation on coming into the company which is a


1047
1:5:22,719 --> 1:5:24,689
somewhat contributing thing where our management theory


1048
1:5:24,689 --> 1:5:28,179
said, it's a very bad thing to do but actually I think it's


1049
1:5:28,179 --> 1:5:31,429
very good, like let me test for why is this person here, why


1050
1:5:31,429 --> 1:5:34,429
are they coming here. There are lots of other ways you can


1051
1:5:34,429 --> 1:5:37,949
do that too. But those subtle differences can have a huge


1052
1:5:37,949 --> 1:5:40,349
impact on how things go.


1053
1:5:40,349 --> 1:5:43,99
I think we have actually passed our time but let me say


1054
1:5:43,99 --> 1:5:46,349
thank you to all panelist. I assume that some of you will be


1055
1:5:46,349 --> 1:5:49,99
available for some people to come over and say hello to


1056
1:5:49,99 --> 1:7:49,99
afterwards, thank you very much.
