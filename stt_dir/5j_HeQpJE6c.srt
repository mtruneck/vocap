[MUSIC PLAYING]


2
0:0:5,14 --> 0:0:8,5
My name is Rafael,
Rafael Rozendaal.


3
0:0:8,5 --> 0:0:9,85
We're in Amsterdam.


4
0:0:9,85 --> 0:0:13,5
And this is the last day of my
exhibition, "The Shift," which


5
0:0:13,5 --> 0:0:16,59
is an exhibition that shows
absolutely nothing, and we're


6
0:0:16,59 --> 0:0:18,22
going to have a look at
what that looks like.


7
0:0:18,22 --> 0:0:20,73
Both my parents are artists, so
it was kind of natural for


8
0:0:20,73 --> 0:0:22,9
me to be drawing and painting,
and all the


9
0:0:22,9 --> 0:0:24,33
materials were in the house.


10
0:0:24,33 --> 0:0:27,92
So it was very natural for me to
go to art school and start


11
0:0:27,92 --> 0:0:29,52
experimenting there.


12
0:0:29,52 --> 0:0:31,78
I just noticed that when I
started using the computer, I


13
0:0:31,78 --> 0:0:33,7
really liked what
came out of it.


14
0:0:33,7 --> 0:0:38,5
So that's why I continued
in that direction.


15
0:0:38,5 --> 0:0:40,12
I got this tattoo because I was
thinking, what's the most


16
0:0:40,12 --> 0:0:41,94
important thing that happened
in the world?


17
0:0:41,94 --> 0:0:44,43
And I thought, well,
the internet.


18
0:0:44,43 --> 0:0:46,74
The base of my work is
these moving images.


19
0:0:46,74 --> 0:0:49,32
They're sometimes interactive
and sometimes moving.


20
0:0:49,32 --> 0:0:51,6
And the audience right
now, it's about 12


21
0:0:51,6 --> 0:0:54,626
million people a year.


22
0:0:54,626 --> 0:0:57,41
This is my first website.


23
0:0:57,41 --> 0:0:59,73
I made it in the year 2000.


24
0:0:59,73 --> 0:1:2,55
I was very surprised that after
I made that website, I


25
0:1:2,55 --> 0:1:3,88
got a lot of response online.


26
0:1:3,88 --> 0:1:6,76
And then a gallerist in Los
Angeles said, why don't you


27
0:1:6,76 --> 0:1:9,47
come over and show this, and
maybe make a new piece?


28
0:1:9,47 --> 0:1:11,72
And then I made this piece
for that opening.


29
0:1:11,72 --> 0:1:18,181
[FART NOISES]


30
0:1:18,181 --> 0:1:21,3
So this was projected very big
in the street, just a simple


31
0:1:21,3 --> 0:1:25,9
mouse, and then just this
projected in the gallery.


32
0:1:25,9 --> 0:1:28,77
A lot of serious art around
it, and then this one.


33
0:1:28,77 --> 0:1:30,675
There's been a lot of
representations of shit.


34
0:1:30,675 --> 0:1:33,72
But because most artwork's with
sculpture and painting,


35
0:1:33,72 --> 0:1:36,9
you can't really depict farts.


36
0:1:36,9 --> 0:1:38,15
So yeah.


37
0:1:38,15 --> 0:1:40,17



38
0:1:40,17 --> 0:1:41,42
New media.


39
0:1:41,42 --> 0:1:45,82



40
0:1:45,82 --> 0:1:48,21
"The Shift," basically the
exhibition is this.


41
0:1:48,21 --> 0:1:50,64
The room is dark-- there's light
right now, but normally.


42
0:1:50,64 --> 0:1:53,54
And then if you walk, you hear
the sound of a mosquito.


43
0:1:53,54 --> 0:1:56,34
So we just have an intern
in the back


44
0:1:56,34 --> 0:1:58,58
who watches the visitor.


45
0:1:58,58 --> 0:2:1,97
And if the visitor's moving,
presses on the sound, and if


46
0:2:1,97 --> 0:2:5,63
the visitor stops,
then nothing.


47
0:2:5,63 --> 0:2:8,19
The interesting question, when
people ask me what's the idea


48
0:2:8,19 --> 0:2:11,26
behind it, is that you believe
that you make something, but


49
0:2:11,26 --> 0:2:13,76
there's actually more
to it, that the work


50
0:2:13,76 --> 0:2:15,59
is sort of a puzzle.


51
0:2:15,59 --> 0:2:19,66
The work is a puzzle, and then
you have to pass the work and


52
0:2:19,66 --> 0:2:22,39
then get to the meaning, which
I don't believe in.


53
0:2:22,39 --> 0:2:24,5
I think the work is the
meaning and the


54
0:2:24,5 --> 0:2:25,3
meaning is the work.


55
0:2:25,3 --> 0:2:28,66
So there's no bigger-- it's as
big as you want to make it.


56
0:2:28,66 --> 0:2:30,84
And I do analyze my work,
but that's not very


57
0:2:30,84 --> 0:2:31,7
important for you.


58
0:2:31,7 --> 0:2:33,28
And then you can analyze
it your way.


59
0:2:33,28 --> 0:2:36,34



60
0:2:36,34 --> 0:2:39,36
I never liked the idea of
creating a unique object.


61
0:2:39,36 --> 0:2:41,62
And then I make this beautiful
drawing, and I sell the


62
0:2:41,62 --> 0:2:43,76
drawing, and then I can't
see it anymore.


63
0:2:43,76 --> 0:2:45,515
And this just spreads
everywhere.


64
0:2:45,515 --> 0:2:48,5
And because of the domain
name, you have a very


65
0:2:48,5 --> 0:2:49,43
exclusive ownership.


66
0:2:49,43 --> 0:2:50,5
It's a unique piece.


67
0:2:50,5 --> 0:2:53,82
But at the same time, the work
is accessible to everyone.


68
0:2:53,82 --> 0:2:57,25
And when I sell websites, the
collector also has to sign a


69
0:2:57,25 --> 0:3:1,85
contract that the work
has to remain public.


70
0:3:1,85 --> 0:3:4,67
I'm staying here in Amsterdam
this week, because I kind of


71
0:3:4,67 --> 0:3:5,59
don't really have a home.


72
0:3:5,59 --> 0:3:8,32
So this is my home
for this week.


73
0:3:8,32 --> 0:3:10,18
I didn't sleep much last
night, because I


74
0:3:10,18 --> 0:3:12,86
found a dead rat.


75
0:3:12,86 --> 0:3:15,39
I kind of--


76
0:3:15,39 --> 0:3:16,85
so I'm going to try
to find another


77
0:3:16,85 --> 0:3:18,22
place to sleep tonight.


78
0:3:18,22 --> 0:3:19,85
Sometimes that works
out, and you get a


79
0:3:19,85 --> 0:3:20,98
really nice hotel room.


80
0:3:20,98 --> 0:3:22,1
And sometimes you don't.


81
0:3:22,1 --> 0:3:23,98
So that's part of the deal.


82
0:3:23,98 --> 0:3:27,534
But yeah, this is my life.


83
0:3:27,534 --> 0:3:30,88
[LAUGHTER]


84
0:3:30,88 --> 0:3:32,98
I work on the computer,
so I can be anywhere.


85
0:3:32,98 --> 0:3:35,64
Usually, rent is cheaper in a
tropical location, so I like


86
0:3:35,64 --> 0:3:36,28
to go there.


87
0:3:36,28 --> 0:3:39,85
And then I go for a while in
Berlin or other places.


88
0:3:39,85 --> 0:3:42,64
The computer was made to make
your life portable, and I like


89
0:3:42,64 --> 0:3:43,61
to live that way.


90
0:3:43,61 --> 0:3:47,36
So this is my studio, my
exhibition space, my meeting


91
0:3:47,36 --> 0:3:49,41
room, my entertainment room.


92
0:3:49,41 --> 0:3:51,42
Everybody lives in their laptop,
but me, maybe even


93
0:3:51,42 --> 0:3:52,43
more than others.


94
0:3:52,43 --> 0:3:56,9
But yeah, this is it.


95
0:3:56,9 --> 0:4:0,1
Right now, we're at the W139
again, the space that was all


96
0:4:0,1 --> 0:4:1,74
empty for the mosquito.


97
0:4:1,74 --> 0:4:5,8
And now the space is all full,
and this is BYOB Amsterdam.


98
0:4:5,8 --> 0:4:9,15



99
0:4:9,15 --> 0:4:11,4
I always notice that
making group


100
0:4:11,4 --> 0:4:12,79
exhibitions is very difficult.


101
0:4:12,79 --> 0:4:15,79
I also notice that all of my
friends own projectors,


102
0:4:15,79 --> 0:4:18,456
especially in Berlin, because
people have big apartments and


103
0:4:18,456 --> 0:4:21,19
they like to watch movies big.


104
0:4:21,19 --> 0:4:24,5
So I figured, if everybody takes
care of their own gear,


105
0:4:24,5 --> 0:4:26,49
then we can make an exhibition
in no time.


106
0:4:26,49 --> 0:4:30,7
So now in about a year, there's
been 48 editions


107
0:4:30,7 --> 0:4:33,84
around the world, and it's
just been moving rapidly.


108
0:4:33,84 --> 0:4:36,82
For me, BYOB is just
about the internet


109
0:4:36,82 --> 0:4:38,45
jumping out of the machine.


110
0:4:38,45 --> 0:4:41,39
This is what we're looking at
all day, but then here, we can


111
0:4:41,39 --> 0:4:44,16
see it all together
in one room.


112
0:4:44,16 --> 0:4:46,41
With BYOB, I took the
approach, saying


113
0:4:46,41 --> 0:4:47,31
everything is cool.


114
0:4:47,31 --> 0:4:48,87
Let's just make chaos.


115
0:4:48,87 --> 0:4:50,645
And then it has its
own strength.


116
0:4:50,645 --> 0:4:52,26
It's sort of like
a thrift store.


117
0:4:52,26 --> 0:4:55,25
So you have to dig through
all the mess and


118
0:4:55,25 --> 0:4:57,63
find what you like.


119
0:4:57,63 --> 0:4:59,592
Minority Report.


120
0:4:59,592 --> 0:5:2,3
There's a lot of crap,
just like anywhere.


121
0:5:2,3 --> 0:5:5,78
But that's kind of
the fun of it.


122
0:5:5,78 --> 0:5:7,995
If anyone in the world
wants to do a BYOB,


123
0:5:7,995 --> 0:5:8,84
they can just do it.


124
0:5:8,84 --> 0:5:10,34
So that's the idea.


125
0:5:10,34 --> 0:7:10,34
