###11 ROB DYRDEK: What we didn't know at the time is how crazy
###13 rapped-out ghetto he really was, 'cause Jamie kind of
###16 cleaned him up.
###16 Like no jewelry, just kept him like, you know how Jamie does,
###20 is like finds you and like turns you
###21 into a street soldier.
###23 And he had just sort of cleaned him up, to where when
###26 he finally quit to ride for Alien, his inner hard-core
###31 Dallas/Michigan ghetto side like exploded the moment he
###35 got on Alien.
###36 We're like, what the hell?
###39 JOSH KALIS: I mean, I was just coming out
###41 of that Dallas shit.
###42 Tech N9ne earrings and Tech N9ne pinkie rings.
###45 And I mean, we thought we were kinda doing it.
###48 
###52 JAMIE THOMAS: Well, Alien, at that time,
###53 though, was that way.
###54 I mean, it was basically all those guys, like
###56 corn rows and cargoes.
###58 And it was basically a full product of the '90s.
###61 So all those dudes were into it.
###63 Kalis went back to Texas and filmed a lot of footage for
###65 his Timecode part, and he had cargoes
###67 throughout the whole thing.
###69 ROB DYRDEK: Despite Alien having that Memory Screen sort
###73 of crazy, artistic--
###76 that set this new precedent in what video production even
###79 could be, us as a team, we were united in this sort of
###82 like more broad scope.
###84 Like we weren't all flowing around and artsy.
###86 We were all listening to hip-hop and it was sort of
###88 like a nice blend of the artists and the creation of
###93 what the brand was.
###93 But we all still sort of maintained the same sort of
###97 style in unity.
###98 And it wasn't overly hip-hop, but it wasn't like rock or
###101 anything else.
###102 And he fit into that really, really well at the time.
###105 He was part of the beginning of that new guard for Alien at
###110 that particular time.
###112 ANNOUNCER: Prepare to timecode.
###114 Josh Kalis.
###115 
###118 JOSH KALIS: To tell you the truth, it had nothing to do
###121 with the image and art direction.
###123 It had to do with Rob Dyrdek, John Drake, and Duane Pitre.
###129 And in Bo Turner was like one of the best dudes.
###134 He was such a ball breaker.
###137 I just wanted to be a part of all that.
###141 We never talked about videos.
###143 Ever.
###144 I don't even know how Timecode came out.
###145 Like I think Dyrdek and maybe Mike Hill or somebody, I mean
###150 they just took whatever footage people
###151 had and made a video.
###153 We weren't filming for a video.
###155 We weren't doing any of that stuff.
###156 They were just, like, man, we gotta put something out.
###158 ROB DYRDEK: And at that time, he was so raw.
###162 Nobody was putting it down in the streets
###164 harder than he was.
###165 
###168 STEVIE WILLIAMS: That's right when he had the cover of
###171 TransWorld, doing a backside 180 with the Golden Gate
###174 Bridge in the back with the Adidas.
###175 It was hot, yo.
###176 It was really, really hot.
###178 You know, me being out in California in San Francisco,
###181 and Josh being Josh, and I was still hanging with little hood
###184 motherfuckers.
###185 So he couldn't really hang with me like that, like he
###188 could in Philly.
###189 But when Josh came through-- it was still all love, but you
###192 know, as far as being competitive and having a good
###195 sponsor and having a wack sponsor, and shooting with the
###197 right photographer and shooting with the wrong
###199 photographer, and not having whatever to get to the next
###203 level, Josh had it all.
###205 It was something that you could model yourself after.
###207 Like, damn, I want to be like Josh.
###208 I want--
###209 I want to get the cover of TransWorld.
###211 I want the DC this.
###212 I want-- you know, but you gotta work for that shit.
###214 I was staying at Josh's house.
###216 And I was wildin' out.
###216 I was only 15, so I was wildin', like throwing up,
###221 just spilling shit, getting caught stealing and running
###224 back in the crib.
###225 Like just--
###226 just blowing the spot up.
###227 And then here comes Lennie Kirk.
###229 I'd go into the crib and like this new dude's
###231 sitting on a couch.
###232 And he's like, yo, you gotta leave.
###234 I'm like, shit, I don't gotta go nowhere.
###236 My man live here.
###236 And Josh was like, yeah, you gotta leave.
###238 And I was like, wow.
###240 So it was a real big fuck you to Lennie Kirk.
###243 But the powerful era that they had wasn't about me.
###247 That's how I look at it now.
###248 It was like, he ran hard with Lennie Kirk for a while.
###251 JOSH KALIS: Well, when the Timecode came out, I didn't
###254 hang out with anybody but, actually, Lennie.
###256 
###263 Like me and Lennie were roommates in San Francisco.
###268 And like, I love Lennie.
###269 Because Lennie is crazy as shit.
###271 Before his Jesus stuff, he was like so
###274 ghetto gangster, just--
###276 like we were two peas in a pod.
###278 You know what I mean?
###279 He had his corn rows and his camos, and I had my camos, and
###282 I mean, we just-- we thought we were the
###284 hardest dudes ever.
###285 But Lennie would take it a little bit further than me.
###291 ROB DYRDEK: You know, when I think of Lennie, how he
###294 skates, I think of that one photo where's he's grinding
###297 this ledge in between a pool, where his arm is just so
###301 rocketed out.
###302 JOSH KALIS: Every time, his arm would be looking like he
###305 was fucking punching the air.
###306 And I mean, he was just, like, so dope.
###310 I loved how he skated.
###312 Like, I was jealous a lot of times.
###314 Because I can't really jump off shit like
###316 he could, you know?
###317 He could do the most tech shit, or he could grind the
###320 most gnarliest shit.
###321 
###326 MIKE BLABAC: With Lennie, he's just such a rad dude to watch
###328 on a skateboard.
###329 That works out bad, that grind-out drop thing.
###333 Like he had to literally pinned himself against the
###335 door and like ran and fucking threw his board down, and it
###338 was pretty raw.
###339 It was sick.
###340 I just remember thinking, like, holy
###343 shit, this guy's insane.
###345 JAMIE THOMAS: I was always a Lennie Kirk--
###347 I was always a fan of his skating.
###349 His Timecode part, seriously hands-down my
###352 favorite video part.
###352 It's definitely in the top five.
###354 The song, the vibe, his whole kit and that time was like
###358 untouchable.
###359 His skating was so sick and so raw.
###362 It was like, I don't even know if anybody's ever even come
###364 out that raw.
###365 Like maybe Train Wreck?
###367 Like maybe?
###368 It was that, like, uncut and unfiltered.
###372 JOSH KALIS: Lennie's skating, it was identical to his
###375 personality.
###377 RB UMALI: Oh, back in the day, gangsta Lennie days?
###379 He would roll up with like corn rows,
###381 blasting gangsta rap.
###382 And he had like--
###383 I know he had this bat in the backseat of his car with like
###385 screws drilled into it.
###386 I think he really have had like a spiked bat.
###389 Because I think he was listening to Wu Tang, and he
###391 wanted to have a spiked bat.
###395 And yeah.
###395 Just driving around drunk, going to house parties,
###398 starting fights.
###399 I remember this one fight broke out in Houston, and they
###402 ended up going back with, like, empty Snapple bottles
###405 they got from my room and like--
###408 I think they torched the house in the middle of the night.
###410 
###413 JOSH KALIS: We were at Denny's one time in San Diego.
###415 Some Marines were in there.
###417 So what's Lennie do?
###418 Like blah, blah, starts talking all this shit to them.
###421 Marine starts talking shit.
###422 About ready to fight.
###423 Lennie reaches under his fucking seat and pulls out a
###426 BB gun and cocks this BB gun to this Marine.
###429 Like what's up now?
###430 Cocks a fucking BB gun.
###431 Well, here comes the Marine, grabs a hammer, like a real
###435 hammer, not like a fucking gun hammer, and fucking bashes
###438 Lennie's car, punches him in the face.
###442 And here come all eight Marines out the thing.
###444 Lennie!
###445 Let's fucking go, dude.
###446 But he was just like that.
###447 Always drawing attention.
###449 And then he hit his head.
###451 And like, smoked weed, and tripped out, and
###453 fucking found God.
###455 LENNIE KIRK: Ask Jesus to forgive your sins always.
###458 Pray always.
###459 Get to know the Lord.
###461 Study and obey the Bible.
###464 Quit sinning.
###465 Escape hell.
###466 JAMIE THOMAS: I've told that story so many times.
###468 It's always a good one to tell in vans, the
###470 story of Lennie Kirk.
###471 Basically what happened to Lennie, you know?
###475 JOSH KALIS: Well, I wasn't there when you grinded the
###478 dumpster and fell back and smacked his head.
###480 But that's not what made him turn to religion.
###486 Either a few days before or a few days after that, he got
###488 ran over by a Pacific Bell truck.
###490 Like full-on from his ankle all the way up.
###493 And he didn't break a bone.
###495 And it was in front of mad skaters.
###497 Then a couple days after that, he was skating across Haight
###503 Street, and this Jeep like, beep, honked the horn at him.
###506 And he must've ran the light or something.
###508 The guy in the Jeep was like, hey, boy,
###510 don't you see the light?
###511 And he was like, don't I fucking see the light?
###513 Like, whatever.
###514 Skate around.
###515 And then that night, he was hanging out with some chick
###517 and he was smoking weed.
###519 And I guess, he was telling me that he was thinking about the
###521 dude in the Jeep.
###523 Don't you see the light?
###524 And fucking bam.
###526 Like, he said he went sober, kicked the chick out, and then
###529 all that psychoness that he had went into religion.
###534 And next thing you know, before every time he tried a
###536 trick, he'd open up the Bible, read a verse, and that was
###539 going to be the outcome of the trick.
###541 In Timecode he 50-50 grinds this long ledge, it's on the
###546 top of a parking ramp and it goes flat, and then he pops
###550 off onto the sidewalk.
###551 And while we were skating that thing, he fucking grinds, his
###555 front truck comes off and he falls backwards and rolls and
###558 [CLAP]
###558 whap!
###559 I mean, he smacks his head so hard.
###560 So I run over there to see if he's all right and he's
###562 praying and he's asking for forgiveness and he's
###564 apologizing.
###566 And when he was done praying, I'm like, yo, dude.
###568 Like what are you praying?
###569 What are you apologizing for?
###571 He was like, man, I jerked off this morning and that's my
###576 punishment.
###576 So we'd start watching the footage on the camera, and
###580 he's like, you see that?
###581 You see that?
###582 Like he swore that he could see God's hand come down and
###586 boom, mush his head into the ground.
###588 And I was like, get the fuck out of here, right?
###591 And I had to deal with that every day until I just had to
###593 like completely separate myself.
###596 If you are wearing-- like for me, I would
###597 be wearing a necklace.
###599 And he'd be like, yo, Kalis, dude.
###600 You're going to hell.
###601 You gon' burn in hell for wearing that necklace.
###603 You representin' a female.
###604 ROB DYRDEK: It was the most cockamamie jibber-jabbish.
###608 Like he spoke in tongues.
###610 It was so all over the crazy map.
###614 I had this argument with them about Hubba Hideout and how he
###617 was going to switch back tail it, even though
###620 Kalis already did.
###621 And I'm like, you can't do that.
###622 He's like, it don't matter.
###624 It doesn't matter.
###625 I'm like, you can't.
###626 So he was doing a sermon for this church.
###630 There was probably 300 people there.
###632 He's just, you know, like, and I walk, I was in the gutter, I
###635 was a [INAUDIBLE]
###636 days.
###637 He's going, he's like--
###638 And I don't, I don't care who did what on what
###641 ledge or who did--
###642 I'm like, it turned into where he was focusing in on me.
###646 Like in the middle of the sermon, he just somehow
###649 twitched into the memory of having the argument of a trick
###652 already being done.
###653 He got fixated on like a young girl, like in a tight top,
###656 like, and you're dressing around like a whore, coming
###658 around, acting like a whore.
###660 And you think you can come around putting your body--
###663 I had to get up, be like, yo, dude.
###665 Yo.
###666 And he's just, like, uh!
###666 And people were saying to me, I can't believe
###668 that didn't move you.
###669 And I'm like, what?
###670 None of it even made sense.
###672 Like the guy was just like, it's like it was so crazy, in
###676 they were just like, aaahhh.
###678 JAMIE THOMAS: He has some pretty heavy mental stability
###681 issues that far outweigh anything he wants to do.
###684 You know what I mean?
###685 He could want to be someone, but he's mentally not capable
###688 of being the person he wants to be.
###690 And I think that that--
###692 I mean, it's like, how do you avoid that?
###694 Basically, I don't know if Carter was the dude who was
###696 helping Lennie, or who was the dude.
###698 But somebody was giving Lennie a temporary platform to be--
###702 like have a normal life for a while.
###705 And then once that kind of crumbled or fell apart, or he
###709 burned the bridge, then he was out there on his own again,
###712 left to his own devices.
###713 And we all saw where that went.
###717 ROB DYRDEK: It just became one of those things, that like he
###719 really never skated after Timecode, really ever again.
###722 Not only was he just being so focused on all things God and
###726 preaching and being in the streets preaching, that
###731 eventually they just, they had no choice.
###734 JOSH KALIS: I mean, in his brain, he is 100% right.
###738 You know what I mean?
###739 I heard he was robbing old ladies in Frisco.
###742 So I'll call him up, Lennie, what are you doing, dude?
###744 Robbing old ladies?
###745 And he was like, man, it's tough times.
###746 The Lord said it was all right.
###749 I was like, wow.
###749 And it was shortly after that is when he got busted robbing
###752 that taxi cab driver, and off to prison he went.
###756 I mean, I don't know the whole story.
###757 I just heard all the rumors about him walking around Pier
###760 7 with a shotgun in his pants, you know?
###764 No, he got out after a few years.
###766 And I actually went to Frisco and skated
###768 with him for a week.
###770 Every day.
###771 And he was killing it.
###772 Like, there's sick footage right now of Lennie board
###775 sliding this flat rail.
###778 It was awesome skating with him.
###780 And next thing I know, I got a phone call from
###783 San Francisco jail.
###784 Like, hey, man.
###785 And I need $20 grand for this lawyer.
###788 I'm like, what are you doing in there?
###788 He's like, I got seven charges, man.
###791 Allegedly it was like kidnapping and some other
###793 crazy shit.
###794 I don't know.
###795 It was pretty wild.
###796 
###801 ROB DYRDEK: After he first went to jail, it was on
###804 September 10.
###805 So he kept calling me over and over from
###807 jail, like, see, Rob?
###809 I told you God just put me in jail.
###811 The end times are here, the end times are here.
###814 And this would have been September 10, 2001.
###818 The next day, 9/11 happened.
###820 So he was like, for sure, the end of the world, God put him
###822 in jail because of that.
###824 And it was like, it was pretty ridiculous.
###826 But the crazy thing, too, is he went-- now he's like a
###829 vato, you know what I'm saying?
###830 Now he's like a Mexican gangster.
###832 Like, have you ever seen his MySpace?
###833 PATRICK O'DELL: No.
###834 
###836 ROB DYRDEK: Wow.
###836 Where it's like, La Vida Loco, and it's like, (IN VATO
###838 ACCENT) Fuck all, fuck all the bitches and my vida, my
###840 bitches and my loco-- like, whatever.
###842 It looks like a Spanish gangbanger's MySpace page.
###845 It's incredible.
###846
