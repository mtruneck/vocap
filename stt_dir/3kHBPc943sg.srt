1
0:0:7,44 --> 0:0:7,53
Parachute has deployed.


2
0:0:7,53 --> 0:0:7,63
We are decelerating.


3
0:0:7,63 --> 0:0:9,55
Heat shield has separated; we are locked on
the ground.


4
0:0:9,55 --> 0:0:33,559
We're down to 90 meters per second at an altitude
of 6.5 kilometers and descending.


5
0:0:33,559 --> 0:0:34,67
Standing by for back shell separation.


6
0:0:34,67 --> 0:0:35,539
We are in powered flight.


7
0:0:35,539 --> 0:0:39,289
We are at altitude of1 kilometer and descending.


8
0:0:39,289 --> 0:0:52,239
Standing by for sky crane.


9
0:0:52,239 --> 0:1:2,6
Sky crane has started.


10
0:1:2,6 --> 0:1:18,14
Touchdown confirmed! We're safe on Mars!


11
0:1:18,14 --> 0:1:23,32
Cheering, applause


12
0:1:23,32 --> 0:1:28,47
We had a major success when we deployed the
arm for the first time on Mars.


13
0:1:28,47 --> 0:1:33,7
This is critical to ensuring that we can get
sample into our instruments and use the arm


14
0:1:33,7 --> 0:1:36,13
for its scientific purposes.


15
0:1:36,13 --> 0:1:40,66
The ChemCam unit, or chemistry and camera
instrument, fired the laser for the first


16
0:1:40,66 --> 0:1:45,95
time on Mars, using the beam from the science
instrument to interrogate a fist-sized rock


17
0:1:45,95 --> 0:1:47,5
called coronation.


18
0:1:47,5 --> 0:1:53,4
Before we could drive curiosity, we wanted
to wiggle our toes a bit and test the steering


19
0:1:53,4 --> 0:1:53,46
actuators.


20
0:1:53,46 --> 0:1:56,57
This is the first time we moved the wheels
on Mars.


21
0:1:56,57 --> 0:1:59,99
We hit a major milestone on Mars.


22
0:1:59,99 --> 0:2:4,82
We completed our first drive of the curiosity
rover.


23
0:2:4,82 --> 0:2:9,75
We drove approximately 3 meters forward and
performed 2 60-degree rotations in a clockwise


24
0:2:9,75 --> 0:2:12,92
direction with imaging in between.


25
0:2:12,92 --> 0:2:17,5
We then drove backwards just under 3 meters
in order to test the wheels in the opposite


26
0:2:17,5 --> 0:2:18,4
direction.


27
0:2:18,4 --> 0:2:24,12
This put us in a great configuration to make
observations of the scours left by the descent


28
0:2:24,12 --> 0:2:30,48
stage engines.


29
0:2:30,48 --> 0:2:39,7
We’ve got a very interesting science experiment
coming up here on Mars.


30
0:2:39,7 --> 0:2:45,3
We are turning on the sample analysis at Mars
instrument for the first time to do an atmospheric


31
0:2:45,3 --> 0:2:46,69
experiment.


32
0:2:46,69 --> 0:2:50,92
This is where we let in atmosphere into the
instrument and perform various science experiments


33
0:2:50,92 --> 0:2:53,88
that determine the composition of the atmosphere.


34
0:2:53,88 --> 0:2:56,45
This is the first time that this is happening.


35
0:2:56,45 --> 0:3:1,319
Within days, we will start our journey to
our first chosen destination on Mars, Glenelg.


36
0:3:1,319 --> 0:3:5,68
We hope to obtain our first drilled rock sample
on Mars at this location.


37
0:3:5,68 --> 0:3:9,79
The team named the landing site this week
after the famous science fiction author, Ray


38
0:3:9,79 --> 0:3:22,34
Bradbury, on his birthday, august 22nd, and
he would have been 92.


39
0:3:22,34 --> 0:3:25,88
Curiosity is still is heading to Glenelg.
We've just stopped at the Bathurst rock formation


40
0:3:25,88 --> 0:3:30,9
to check it out with the robotic arm mounted
instruments: a hand lens imager and a spectrometer.


41
0:3:30,9 --> 0:3:34,59
Got some great science data there for the
science team and now we're moving to a new


42
0:3:34,59 --> 0:3:38,77
rover location called Rocknest. And we've
come to Rocknest because it has nice windblown


43
0:3:38,77 --> 0:3:39,76
sand drifts.


44
0:3:39,76 --> 0:3:46,66
At the Rocknest location we really are entering
a new phase in Mars exploration with Curiosity.


45
0:3:46,66 --> 0:3:50,3
We're starting the surface sampling part of
the mission. The reason this is a one-ton


46
0:3:50,3 --> 0:3:56,77
rover with a 200-pound robotic arm, is because
we have these tools to acquire bits of Mars,


47
0:3:56,77 --> 0:4:2,16
you know, either with a scoop or with a drill;
process those samples for our very sensitive


48
0:4:2,16 --> 0:4:3,75
analytical lab instruments.


49
0:4:3,75 --> 0:4:9,4
So our scoop - this is not a giant backhoe
on Mars - we basically have more like an oversized


50
0:4:9,4 --> 0:4:14,879
tablespoon attached to the end of the arm
and we grab on the order of 20 grams of material


51
0:4:14,879 --> 0:4:22,79
and we position the arm over the soil target
and then we just actuate the scoop, do a little


52
0:4:22,79 --> 0:4:27,3
bit of vibration to kind of level out the
sample and then raise the arm up, close the


53
0:4:27,3 --> 0:4:34,69
scoop and carry on with our sampling activity.


54
0:4:34,69 --> 0:4:39,35
When we first arrived at Rocknest, we performed
a wheel scuff maneuver. This is our rover's


55
0:4:39,35 --> 0:4:43,53
version of kicking up the dirt with your hiking
boot to determine if the Rocknest area was


56
0:4:43,53 --> 0:4:45,82
indeed a good first scoop target.


57
0:4:45,82 --> 0:4:50,87
The first scoop was successfully performed
on Sol 61 and the entire team was excited


58
0:4:50,87 --> 0:4:55,94
to see the MastCam images showing the scoop
full of dirt, as well as the video of the


59
0:4:55,94 --> 0:5:1,94
vibration activities performed with the turret-mounted
tools. This vibration allows the team to level


60
0:5:1,94 --> 0:5:7,31
out and remove any excess sample before closing
the scoop, and it also provides some insight


61
0:5:7,31 --> 0:5:9,34
into the makeup of the soil.


62
0:5:9,34 --> 0:5:13,75
Any large particles would tend to float up
to the top as the entire sample is vibrated,


63
0:5:13,75 --> 0:5:19,3
much the same way you would shake out the
marshmallows in your box of Lucky Charms.


64
0:5:19,3 --> 0:5:23,19
Curiosity processed the scoop sample through
CHIMRA, our labyrinth of passageways at the


65
0:5:23,19 --> 0:5:28,69
end of the arm that we use to sieve and portion
the soil sample. We did some internal sandblasting


66
0:5:28,69 --> 0:5:33,62
by vibrating the sample at different orientations
on the turret in order to remove any internal


67
0:5:33,62 --> 0:5:34,41
contamination.


68
0:5:34,41 --> 0:5:39,71
A soil sample was dropped off to the rover’s
observation tray for assessment by the science


69
0:5:39,71 --> 0:5:45,729
team. This sample was determined to be suitable
for drop off to the CheMin instrument.


70
0:5:45,729 --> 0:5:51,4
The CheMin instrument uses X-rays in order
to image the sample and determine what minerals


71
0:5:51,4 --> 0:5:56,169
make it up. This helps geologists understand
how the rock formed and how it's related to


72
0:5:56,169 --> 0:5:59,72
other rocks we've studied so far on Mars.


73
0:5:59,72 --> 0:6:4,87
Scientists identified numerous bright grains
in the soil. Because of the small piece of


74
0:6:4,87 --> 0:6:9,58
plastic from the landing event that had been
found earlier in the week, the team proceeded


75
0:6:9,58 --> 0:6:14,34
cautiously, dumping the second scoop collected
and imaging the bright grains.


76
0:6:14,34 --> 0:6:18,82
These bright grains were later determined
to be components of the Martian soil, and


77
0:6:18,82 --> 0:6:23,889
therefore, the sample was deemed to be suitable
for delivery to the CheMin instrument for


78
0:6:23,889 --> 0:6:24,65
analysis.


79
0:6:24,65 --> 0:6:30,8
The science team requested MastCam and NavCam
mosaics of the outcrops in the direction of


80
0:6:30,8 --> 0:6:34,139
Glenelg, to plan Curiosity's journey to this
next science destination.


81
0:6:34,139 --> 0:6:37,86
In its spare time, Curiosity has also been
making measurements with other instruments,


82
0:6:37,86 --> 0:6:40,35
including the ChemCam instrument, which is
what I work on.


83
0:6:40,35 --> 0:6:44,71
ChemCam is actually two instruments in one.
It includes a camera with a telephoto lens


84
0:6:44,71 --> 0:6:49,79
and it also has a laser that vaporizes a very
small amount of rock so we can tell what its


85
0:6:49,79 --> 0:6:56,889
chemical composition is.


86
0:6:56,889 --> 0:7:1,56
We've been analyzing rocks in an area called
Rocknest, and I'll tell you in particular


87
0:7:1,56 --> 0:7:6,61
about one called Zephyr. This one is interesting
because it appears to be made of 2 different


88
0:7:6,61 --> 0:7:7,55
types of materials.


89
0:7:7,55 --> 0:7:12,419
It's got this harder, more resistant material
on the top, capping it, and then beneath it


90
0:7:12,419 --> 0:7:17,21
has a lighter colored softer material that
appears to erode more easily. It's actually


91
0:7:17,21 --> 0:7:21,75
eroded into a set of natural arches, so some
of our team members have taken to calling


92
0:7:21,75 --> 0:7:24,33
it "Stonehenge."


93
0:7:24,33 --> 0:7:29,71
This feature is really only an inch long.
We're shooting this from about 8 feet away,


94
0:7:29,71 --> 0:7:31,24
making the pointing very difficult.


95
0:7:31,24 --> 0:7:35,77
So that's why we decided to do 9 points instead
of just 2, just to make sure we would hit


96
0:7:35,77 --> 0:7:37,639
the material of interest.


97
0:7:37,639 --> 0:7:41,36
Coming up, we'll be able to use this information
that we've learned from ChemCam in order to


98
0:7:41,36 --> 0:7:45,57
decide which targets we should hit next with
other instruments.


99
0:7:45,57 --> 0:7:50,789
CheMin performs what we call X-ray diffraction
measurements on powdered rocks and soil samples.


100
0:7:50,789 --> 0:7:55,139
An X-ray diffraction is the best method for
telling us what minerals are present in a


101
0:7:55,139 --> 0:8:0,0
rock or soil because it is sensitive to the
arrangements of atoms in minerals. As the


102
0:8:0,0 --> 0:8:4,81
X-rays strike the soil sample, CheMin shows
us how mineral crystals distinctively interact


103
0:8:4,81 --> 0:8:10,2
with X-rays, and this image shows our first
X-ray diffraction results. The diffraction


104
0:8:10,2 --> 0:8:14,96
signals appear on the detector as rings that
represent the fingerprint of the individual


105
0:8:14,96 --> 0:8:18,759
minerals. The rings tell us not only what
minerals are present in the soil but also


106
0:8:18,759 --> 0:8:20,71
how abundant they are.


107
0:8:20,71 --> 0:8:25,43
The CheMin data provide us with distinctive
signatures of the minerals: plagioclase feldspar,


108
0:8:25,43 --> 0:8:30,639
pyroxenes, and olivines. Peridot is a variety
of olivine; just keep in mind that the olivine


109
0:8:30,639 --> 0:8:35,389
in the soil sample is much smaller than these
crystals. Roughly half of the soil consists


110
0:8:35,389 --> 0:8:40,38
of poorly crystalline material, such as volcanic
glass. Thus, this Martian soil appears very


111
0:8:40,38 --> 0:8:44,709
similar to some weathered basaltic soils that
we see on Earth, in places like the flanks


112
0:8:44,709 --> 0:8:46,7
of Mauna Kea, Hawaii.


113
0:8:46,7 --> 0:8:50,83
You can appreciate how revolutionary CheMin
is when you consider that instruments of this


114
0:8:50,83 --> 0:8:55,52
type on Earth are typically about the size
of a doublewide refrigerator and the CheMin


115
0:8:55,52 --> 0:9:0,5
instrument on the Mars Science Laboratory
is about the size of a shoebox. CheMin has


116
0:9:0,5 --> 0:9:4,47
been modified for use on Earth in places such
as Antarctica and the Arctic.


117
0:9:4,47 --> 0:9:9,6
It's also been applied for the detection of
counterfeit pharmaceuticals around the worlds


118
0:9:9,6 --> 0:9:14,55
and a modification of the instrument has been
used in archeological studies to help us understand


119
0:9:14,55 --> 0:9:17,8
the nature of the surfaces and how we might
protect them.


120
0:9:17,8 --> 0:9:21,42
In the coming weeks and months, we're excited
to measure more X-ray diffraction data on


121
0:9:21,42 --> 0:9:25,67
soils and rocks to tell us much more about
the geology of Gale Crater.


122
0:9:25,67 --> 0:9:31,86
While our robotic explorer has been busy characterizing
the surface of Mars, the SAM team has also


123
0:9:31,86 --> 0:9:36,18
been busy, but we've been looking at something
invisible, the Martian atmosphere.


124
0:9:36,18 --> 0:9:43,22
SAM, or Sample Analysis at Mars, is not one
instrument, but three, all of which are designed


125
0:9:43,22 --> 0:9:49,5
to work together to chemically characterize
Mars. SAM measures chemical elements and molecules,


126
0:9:49,5 --> 0:9:58,2
in a mass or size range between 2 and 535
mass units and we do this by looking at gases.


127
0:9:58,2 --> 0:10:3,56
We can bake solid samples until they give
up their volatile components or their gases


128
0:10:3,56 --> 0:10:8,61
or we can directly inhale the Martian atmosphere
through our inlet ports.


129
0:10:8,61 --> 0:10:14,54
With our QMS, SAM is able to detect the most
dominant gas in the Martian atmosphere, carbon


130
0:10:14,54 --> 0:10:19,75
dioxide. We've not only measured its abundance
and the ratio to other gases in the Martian


131
0:10:19,75 --> 0:10:26,45
atmosphere but we've also measured its isotopic
character. The other instruments are a tunable


132
0:10:26,45 --> 0:10:32,49
laser spectrometer and a gas chromatograph,
the latter being used mostly to look for organic


133
0:10:32,49 --> 0:10:34,2
molecules in solids.


134
0:10:34,2 --> 0:10:40,5
Now, the tunable laser spectrometer has a
special role for SAM in that it can very sensitively


135
0:10:40,5 --> 0:10:47,11
detect the organic molecule, methane, which
has been observed from the Earth telescopically


136
0:10:47,11 --> 0:10:54,64
and also by the Mars Express orbiter at very,
very low limits in the Martian atmosphere.


137
0:10:54,64 --> 0:10:59,61
We're trying to discover whether or not we
can see this molecule from the Martian surface


138
0:10:59,61 --> 0:11:6,149
and if it has any variation from season to
season. In the coming months, wherever Curiosity


139
0:11:6,149 --> 0:11:12,2
goes, SAM will continue to sniff the Martian
atmosphere, periodically looking for changes


140
0:11:12,2 --> 0:11:16,75
on a seasonal or maybe even diurnal basis
and that will tell us something about the


141
0:11:16,75 --> 0:11:21,269
dynamics of the exchange between the surface
and the atmosphere.


142
0:11:21,269 --> 0:11:26,36
A lot of what this mission is about is figuring
out the possibility that ancient Mars was


143
0:11:26,36 --> 0:11:30,81
a habitable environment. But we're also studying
the present environment. Two instruments that


144
0:11:30,81 --> 0:11:34,89
help with that are the RAD instrument and
the REMS instrument.


145
0:11:34,89 --> 0:11:39,19
The RAD instrument is a radiation assessment
detector. It measures the high-energy radiation


146
0:11:39,19 --> 0:11:45,149
coming up from the cosmic rays and the sun.
That radiation is changed as it goes through


147
0:11:45,149 --> 0:11:48,73
Mars' atmosphere to where we detect it on
the surface.


148
0:11:48,73 --> 0:11:52,38
These measurements are helping to understand
what the environment is like on the surface


149
0:11:52,38 --> 0:11:58,16
so that future astronauts will know how to
protect themselves from this radiation.


150
0:11:58,16 --> 0:12:2,47
Another instrument that Curiosity has that
measures the modern environment is called


151
0:12:2,47 --> 0:12:7,22
the rover environmental monitoring station.
It's basically our weather station. We measure


152
0:12:7,22 --> 0:12:11,98
a lot of things including pressure and humidity,
temperature and wind.


153
0:12:11,98 --> 0:12:17,149
It's been seeing little dips in pressure around
noon that seemed like the signature of dust


154
0:12:17,149 --> 0:12:21,51
devils. Only thing is our pictures haven't
turned up any dust devils.


155
0:12:21,51 --> 0:12:25,72
Spirit and Opportunity saw lots of dust devils
moving across the horizon. Our best guess


156
0:12:25,72 --> 0:12:30,709
at what's going on is that Curiosity is seeing
dust devils go right over it.


157
0:12:30,709 --> 0:12:35,43
So what we think is happening is the same
sorts of vortexes, driven by convection are


158
0:12:35,43 --> 0:12:40,89
occurring on Mars at the Curiosity's site
but just not picking up dust.


159
0:12:40,89 --> 0:12:43,62
Another thing that REMS has been measuring
is winds. Turns out we're in a pretty interesting


160
0:12:43,62 --> 0:12:48,39
place inside of Gale Crater. We're right at
the base of a 5-kilometer high mountain to


161
0:12:48,39 --> 0:12:52,279
the south of us and then there's a pretty
tall crater rim to the north of us and we're


162
0:12:52,279 --> 0:12:55,329
sitting in kind of a flat depression between
the two.


163
0:12:55,329 --> 0:12:59,61
The winds blow up and down the mountain as
the temperature changes during the day and


164
0:12:59,61 --> 0:13:4,399
up and down the crater slopes and then along
the depression where we're at. So right now


165
0:13:4,399 --> 0:13:8,14
we're trying to figure out from the REMS data
exactly which parts of that wind field we're


166
0:13:8,14 --> 0:13:12,38
measuring.


167
0:13:12,38 --> 0:13:16,279
After several weeks of being stationary at
the Rocknest site, we began driving again


168
0:13:16,279 --> 0:13:17,97
on Saw 100.


169
0:13:17,97 --> 0:13:22,42
This marked a significant milestone on the
mission as we reached about a half-kilometer


170
0:13:22,42 --> 0:13:25,32
of total driving distance on the surface of
Mars.


171
0:13:25,32 --> 0:13:29,86
The left front wheel is sitting on a rock
that we’ve dubbed “Bell Island”.


172
0:13:29,86 --> 0:13:35,209
We plan to back up off that rock to bring
the rock into the arm’s workspace and we’re


173
0:13:35,209 --> 0:13:40,3
going to do some contact science on it with
APXS and MAHLI.


174
0:13:40,3 --> 0:13:43,91
After completing our science campaign at our
current location, we’re going to be moving


175
0:13:43,91 --> 0:13:45,99
to the east to a place called Point Lake.


176
0:13:45,99 --> 0:13:51,18
From here, we’re going to be looking for
a target to perform our first ever drill on


177
0:13:51,18 --> 0:13:52,68
Mars.


178
0:13:52,68 --> 0:13:56,95
We've wrapped up our scientific study of Rocknest,
which also means that we've completed the


179
0:13:56,95 --> 0:14:2,24
checkout and first scientific use of all our
instruments on the rover and it truly is working


180
0:14:2,24 --> 0:14:2,98
great.


181
0:14:2,98 --> 0:14:7,11
We began the Rocknest campaign by searching
for a suitable drift of sandy soil using our


182
0:14:7,11 --> 0:14:12,639
MastCam color cameras. We used out ChemCam
laser and our APXS chemical sensor to do an


183
0:14:12,639 --> 0:14:17,67
initial chemical analysis of the soil, determining
whether it was similar to soils that we understand


184
0:14:17,67 --> 0:14:23,12
from Spirit and Opportunity and therefore
safe for scooping and sending to our laboratories.


185
0:14:23,12 --> 0:14:27,61
We use MAHLI, our hand lens imager to take
close up views of the soil to look at different


186
0:14:27,61 --> 0:14:32,94
particle sizes, shapes and colors and how
they change with depth.


187
0:14:32,94 --> 0:14:36,68
We then scooped up the soil and analyzed it
with our X-ray diffraction instrument that


188
0:14:36,68 --> 0:14:41,17
can identify minerals in the soil based on
their unique crystal structure. But it turned


189
0:14:41,17 --> 0:14:44,649
out that a good amount of the material in
the soil was not crystalline but that's no


190
0:14:44,649 --> 0:14:47,69
problem for our other laboratory, SAM.


191
0:14:47,69 --> 0:14:52,139
SAM heated up the soil in an oven, measured
various gases released as the soil components


192
0:14:52,139 --> 0:14:56,67
broke down, such as water, carbon dioxide,
oxygen and sulfur.


193
0:14:56,67 --> 0:15:1,88
Not surprisingly, the results show a composition
that is typical of Mars soils studied at other


194
0:15:1,88 --> 0:15:7,839
sites with perhaps some very simple carbon
containing molecules and perchlorate salts.


195
0:15:7,839 --> 0:15:13,2
We haven't yet seen any complex organic molecules
but sand isn't the best place to look.


196
0:15:13,2 --> 0:15:17,35
Finally, it's worth remembering that the big
questions in science, whether Copernicus finding


197
0:15:17,35 --> 0:15:22,43
that the Earth goes around the sun or Darwin
showing that natural selection drives biological


198
0:15:22,43 --> 0:15:27,839
evolution, were answered only after many measurements
were taken compared against one another and


199
0:15:27,839 --> 0:15:33,1
hypotheses were proposed and tested against
data. Only then can the big picture emerge


200
0:15:33,1 --> 0:15:35,23
and the theory get accepted.


201
0:15:35,23 --> 0:15:38,92
It'll be no different for Curiosity in its
mission to understand the habitability of


202
0:15:38,92 --> 0:15:43,6
ancient Mars at Gale Crater. There won't be
any single image or measurement that'll answer


203
0:15:43,6 --> 0:15:48,949
everything. We're in it for the long haul.
But now we know that we have a fantastic rover,


204
0:15:48,949 --> 0:17:48,949
a great set of tools, and a fully functional
scientific payload, so let's get on exploring.
