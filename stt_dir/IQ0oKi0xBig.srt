0:0:18,2 --> 0:0:21,96
In Darlington, in 2008, a team of enthusiasts is building


2
0:0:21,96 --> 0:0:28,88
the first brand-new British steam locomotive from scratch in nearly 50 years.


3
0:0:28,88 --> 0:0:34,0
It's a multi-million pound endeavour that started nearly 20 years ago.


4
0:0:34,0 --> 0:0:38,28
Though the project is unique, the enthusiasm is not.


5
0:0:38,28 --> 0:0:44,92
Steam engines still have a huge and passionate following all over Britain.


6
0:0:44,92 --> 0:0:47,56
When you're near a steam locomotive,


7
0:0:47,56 --> 0:0:50,24
there's an almost elemental force at work.


8
0:0:50,24 --> 0:0:56,92
You can feel every single aspect of that machine is working.


9
0:0:56,92 --> 0:1:3,76
It's passionate, it's theatrical, it's dirty, noisy, powerful.


10
0:1:3,76 --> 0:1:8,32
It's heavy metal in motion.


11
0:1:8,32 --> 0:1:11,6
It's a combination of noise, and atmosphere,


12
0:1:11,6 --> 0:1:14,6
vast, cranking engines and colour and coal and fire.


13
0:1:14,6 --> 0:1:25,64
I just think it's the most wonderful thing on earth.


14
0:1:25,64 --> 0:1:28,76
Most of us think of steam trains as museum pieces.


15
0:1:28,76 --> 0:1:35,8
They were a Victorian technology, dirty, incredibly inefficient and dangerous.


16
0:1:35,8 --> 0:1:37,84
But as late as 1968,


17
0:1:37,84 --> 0:1:42,56
scheduled steam services still ran on British railways.


18
0:1:42,56 --> 0:1:48,28
After World War II, most European countries switched to diesel and electric powered trains.


19
0:1:48,28 --> 0:1:52,0
Britain chose to stick with steam power.


20
0:1:52,0 --> 0:1:55,88
Thousands of new steam locomotives were built.


21
0:1:55,88 --> 0:2:1,0
A quixotic enterprise doomed to failure.


22
0:2:1,0 --> 0:2:5,84
The steam engine had been around for 150 years, it had done its job, the world had moved on.


23
0:2:5,84 --> 0:2:11,64
The day of the diesel and electric train had come, and steam had to die.


24
0:2:11,64 --> 0:2:14,88
Other countries left steam behind long ago.


25
0:2:14,88 --> 0:2:17,36
Why did Britain persist?


26
0:2:17,36 --> 0:2:34,4
And why do we still find it so hard to let go of steam?


27
0:2:34,4 --> 0:2:37,56
The origins of Britain's post-war obsession with steam


28
0:2:37,56 --> 0:2:47,48
lie in the decision to build over 2,500 brand-new locomotives between 1948 and 1960.


29
0:2:47,48 --> 0:2:51,2
This was in stark contrast to many European countries,


30
0:2:51,2 --> 0:2:55,96
which chose to leave Victorian designed steam power behind.


31
0:2:55,96 --> 0:3:1,16
If you look at the railways of Italy, France and Germany,


32
0:3:1,16 --> 0:3:3,64
which were not entirely destroyed,


33
0:3:3,64 --> 0:3:8,68
but certainly in Germany, 70% of the bridges were blown up.


34
0:3:8,68 --> 0:3:11,56
Quite a lot of the railways were completely destroyed.


35
0:3:11,56 --> 0:3:14,96
And, particularly in France, they said, "Right, we are going to,


36
0:3:14,96 --> 0:3:18,44
"as fast as we possibly can, build a new railway."


37
0:3:18,44 --> 0:3:21,76
And when they built their new railway they said, "Right,


38
0:3:21,76 --> 0:3:24,8
"we don't want steam any more, we are going to electrify."


39
0:3:24,8 --> 0:3:31,16
The destruction of allied Europe's railways meant they had to be rebuilt from scratch.


40
0:3:31,16 --> 0:3:33,92
Our railways hadn't been destroyed outright.


41
0:3:33,92 --> 0:3:37,8
It was possible to patch them up, and keep them running with steam.


42
0:3:37,8 --> 0:3:42,64
The finances for a complete overhaul were not yet available.


43
0:3:42,64 --> 0:3:48,32
There were investment shortages across the whole of the UK economy.


44
0:3:48,32 --> 0:3:51,52
And railways were not top of the agenda, quite rightly.


45
0:3:51,52 --> 0:3:55,96
There was a National Health Service to fund, there were houses to build,


46
0:3:55,96 --> 0:4:0,4
there was a huge housing shortage. There was a steel industry to revive.


47
0:4:0,4 --> 0:4:4,6
There were tremendous investment challenges.


48
0:4:4,6 --> 0:4:7,68
The railways may not have been Britain's top priority,


49
0:4:7,68 --> 0:4:14,56
but their central role in the war effort had been crucial to victory.


50
0:4:14,56 --> 0:4:17,64
The use of railways during the war was a critical element,


51
0:4:17,64 --> 0:4:24,2
because the railways were not only operating at volumes that were much higher than in peace time,


52
0:4:24,2 --> 0:4:26,8
but there was no time to maintain the railways.


53
0:4:26,8 --> 0:4:30,68
Indeed, it was quite dangerous times to try and maintain the railways.


54
0:4:30,68 --> 0:4:33,8
The non-stop journey from Holland to home


55
0:4:33,8 --> 0:4:36,84
was made possible by the military authorities and British Railways.


56
0:4:36,84 --> 0:4:39,6
Red tape was cut and the green light shown...


57
0:4:39,6 --> 0:4:45,4
The Second World War left the four big private companies completely bankrupt,


58
0:4:45,4 --> 0:4:48,6
as far as their infrastructure was concerned,


59
0:4:48,6 --> 0:4:51,0
pretty much smashed up as well.


60
0:4:51,0 --> 0:4:54,52
Really, that's why British Railways came into being


61
0:4:54,52 --> 0:4:58,52
because the war had rendered the railways almost inoperable


62
0:4:58,52 --> 0:5:3,48
as a private source of income, to a certain extent.


63
0:5:3,48 --> 0:5:8,16
Most of Europe had operated nationalised railways before World War II.


64
0:5:8,16 --> 0:5:12,0
Britain had run four big, private railway companies.


65
0:5:12,0 --> 0:5:14,4
The London and North Eastern Railway,


66
0:5:14,4 --> 0:5:16,64
the London, Midland and Scottish Railway,


67
0:5:16,64 --> 0:5:21,4
the Southern Railway and the Great Western Railway.


68
0:5:21,4 --> 0:5:23,72
We had the combined railways system


69
0:5:23,72 --> 0:5:28,32
with four major companies, heavily regulated,


70
0:5:28,32 --> 0:5:30,92
providing railway services.


71
0:5:30,92 --> 0:5:35,4
They were utilities, they weren't particularly profitable,


72
0:5:35,4 --> 0:5:37,56
and they were largely taken for granted.


73
0:5:37,56 --> 0:5:42,2
The four big railway companies had struggled even before the war.


74
0:5:42,2 --> 0:5:46,6
When the Labour government swept into power in 1945,


75
0:5:46,6 --> 0:5:49,32
they promised to invest in the railways.


76
0:5:49,32 --> 0:5:52,36
Nationalisation was on the agenda.


77
0:5:52,36 --> 0:5:56,4
And the railways, what have we got there?


78
0:5:56,4 --> 0:6:0,8
Operated for more than 100 years without a break.


79
0:6:0,8 --> 0:6:2,8
Feeding a war machine for six weary years


80
0:6:2,8 --> 0:6:8,44
without adequate renewals and repairs that left them as tired as the rest of us.


81
0:6:8,44 --> 0:6:11,68
A wonderful, but complicated heritage,


82
0:6:11,68 --> 0:6:14,36
that could do with a bit of sorting out.


83
0:6:14,36 --> 0:6:18,2
The railways were run down after the Second World War,


84
0:6:18,2 --> 0:6:21,4
and the private sector, quite frankly I think,


85
0:6:21,4 --> 0:6:23,92
was going to find it hard to carry on.


86
0:6:23,92 --> 0:6:28,64
So when the government, as part of its nationalisation programme,


87
0:6:28,64 --> 0:6:33,96
offered the railways the possibility of compensation,


88
0:6:33,96 --> 0:6:37,6
the owners snatched their hands off, actually.


89
0:6:37,6 --> 0:6:43,12
1st January 1948 ushered in a period of new hope.


90
0:6:43,12 --> 0:6:49,4
The four great railways companies were brought together into one single new organisation -


91
0:6:49,4 --> 0:6:52,64
British Railways.


92
0:6:52,64 --> 0:6:55,68
It's just a few minutes before midnight, and very soon,


93
0:6:55,68 --> 0:6:57,56
the signalman here will signal in


94
0:6:57,56 --> 0:7:6,2
the last Great Western Railway train to pass through Reading.


95
0:7:6,2 --> 0:7:10,6
On day one of British Railways everyone was thinking, "We've got a bright future,


96
0:7:10,6 --> 0:7:14,8
"we're going to modernise, we're going to be a shining example


97
0:7:14,8 --> 0:7:17,64
"of a modern passenger transport system."


98
0:7:17,64 --> 0:7:20,6
With the passing of the old year,


99
0:7:20,6 --> 0:7:24,16
the principal railways of Great Britain, London Transport,


100
0:7:24,16 --> 0:7:28,0
came under public ownership. So the first big stride


101
0:7:28,0 --> 0:7:31,16
was taken towards establishing in this country


102
0:7:31,16 --> 0:7:35,36
a publicly owned transport system under unified management.


103
0:7:35,36 --> 0:7:40,56
The vesting of the four mainline companies, and more than 50 others


104
0:7:40,56 --> 0:7:46,76
in the British Transport Commission, is indeed an historic occasion.


105
0:7:46,76 --> 0:7:50,56
You can imagine the scene at midnight on 31st December.


106
0:7:50,56 --> 0:7:54,52
In many people's eyes, become owned by the people,


107
0:7:54,52 --> 0:7:58,8
whistles were let off, no doubt caps were thrown into the air.


108
0:7:58,8 --> 0:8:3,24
A very theatrical moment, a moment I think of real enthusiasm amongst


109
0:8:3,24 --> 0:8:7,8
great swathes of the population that the railways had become


110
0:8:7,8 --> 0:8:9,8
British Railways, the people's railway.


111
0:8:9,8 --> 0:8:14,8
But officially, the Great Western Railway is dead.


112
0:8:14,8 --> 0:8:17,56
And to many, undoubtedly, the late lamented.


113
0:8:17,56 --> 0:8:21,32
The assets they inherited were massive. They inherited everything


114
0:8:21,32 --> 0:8:25,12
that was within the control of the former railway companies.


115
0:8:25,12 --> 0:8:29,0
Not only the infrastructure which they owned, the track, signalling,


116
0:8:29,0 --> 0:8:33,36
all the locomotives, a very large number, and we're talking about


117
0:8:33,36 --> 0:8:38,68
tens of thousands of wagons, were just not fit for purpose.


118
0:8:38,68 --> 0:8:43,52
What also came into the railway operations was shipping, hotels,


119
0:8:43,52 --> 0:8:46,4
and well over a million people.


120
0:8:46,4 --> 0:8:51,0
British Railways were starting a new chapter, and so were the British people.


121
0:8:51,0 --> 0:8:55,12
Travel restrictions were lifted, and people took the opportunity


122
0:8:55,12 --> 0:9:0,8
to journey around their country again, looking for light relief.


123
0:9:0,8 --> 0:9:4,44
After the war, people responded to the new freedom to travel.


124
0:9:4,44 --> 0:9:9,52
Firstly, through more and more people going away on holiday to a resort,


125
0:9:9,52 --> 0:9:14,12
the archetypal fortnight in Hastings or Brighton or wherever it was.


126
0:9:14,12 --> 0:9:16,16
But also through the excursion.


127
0:9:16,16 --> 0:9:20,56
Both of those were responses to people's desire to get around,


128
0:9:20,56 --> 0:9:26,96
and there's no doubt about it, people started to travel again, big time.


129
0:9:26,96 --> 0:9:30,88
The mounting pressure on the world's oldest rail system


130
0:9:30,88 --> 0:9:34,0
got engineers and managers thinking about the future.


131
0:9:34,0 --> 0:9:38,92
The question of steam's continuing place on our railways had to be addressed.


132
0:9:38,92 --> 0:9:44,36
The steam locomotive had been a very successful technology for Britain's railways.


133
0:9:44,36 --> 0:9:48,72
But even in the 1930s, there had been discussions about


134
0:9:48,72 --> 0:9:55,36
how great a future, how long a future steam traction had.


135
0:9:55,36 --> 0:9:58,64
After the Second World War, the debate started again.


136
0:9:58,64 --> 0:10:1,56
What sort of traction should be used?


137
0:10:1,56 --> 0:10:5,52
Leading British Railways' search for a new type of locomotive


138
0:10:5,52 --> 0:10:7,84
was their chief engineer, Robin Riddles,


139
0:10:7,84 --> 0:10:10,36
who had three options to look at.


140
0:10:10,36 --> 0:10:14,68
Traditional coal-powered steam, electric or diesel.


141
0:10:14,68 --> 0:10:17,4
Electric trains had been successfully run in parts


142
0:10:17,4 --> 0:10:20,4
of southern England since the turn of the century.


143
0:10:20,4 --> 0:10:24,28
They seemed a logical replacement for steam.


144
0:10:24,28 --> 0:10:28,52
Electric was superior, it is superior, it was superior.


145
0:10:28,52 --> 0:10:33,36
But it cost more. Robin Riddles was in fact in favour of electrification,


146
0:10:33,36 --> 0:10:36,84
which was ruled out because of investment shortages after the war.


147
0:10:36,84 --> 0:10:42,8
We were in the middle of the austerity period.


148
0:10:42,8 --> 0:10:46,44
Electrification required miles and miles of costly overhead lines.


149
0:10:46,44 --> 0:10:50,96
Diesel power was more straightforward.


150
0:10:50,96 --> 0:10:56,84
Yet the first diesel trains to run on main lines in 1948 proved very unreliable.


151
0:10:56,84 --> 0:11:1,0
However, the real argument against using diesel power at the time


152
0:11:1,0 --> 0:11:3,8
came down to energy supplies.


153
0:11:3,8 --> 0:11:5,56
Diesel traction, certainly, relied on oil.


154
0:11:5,56 --> 0:11:9,12
There were some people who argued that we didn't have any oil -


155
0:11:9,12 --> 0:11:12,8
of course, nobody knew about North Sea oil in those days -


156
0:11:12,8 --> 0:11:15,64
and that it would be very foolish to turn the railways over


157
0:11:15,64 --> 0:11:19,0
to an oil-based form of traction, diesel.


158
0:11:19,0 --> 0:11:26,8
It was felt that coal was an indigenous fuel from this country, oil wasn't, and therefore we should


159
0:11:26,8 --> 0:11:32,96
use coal, we should use it to continue with steam locomotives as long as possible, and eventually


160
0:11:32,96 --> 0:11:36,28
convert the mainline railways to electricity,


161
0:11:36,28 --> 0:11:40,0
again using electricity produced from burning coal.


162
0:11:40,0 --> 0:11:43,68
Steam was the proven technology.


163
0:11:43,68 --> 0:11:46,2
Everybody knew how a steam locomotive worked,


164
0:11:46,2 --> 0:11:50,28
how it could be used most effectively, and above all, steam traction was cheap.


165
0:11:50,28 --> 0:11:52,4
It was cheap to build, anyway,


166
0:11:52,4 --> 0:11:56,36
it didn't cost very much to construct a locomotive.


167
0:11:56,36 --> 0:12:0,84
Britain was not yet ready for the expensive switch to electric or diesel.


168
0:12:0,84 --> 0:12:3,52
Steam power was cheap and coal was plentiful.


169
0:12:3,52 --> 0:12:6,4
But the decision to stick with steam at this time


170
0:12:6,4 --> 0:12:10,8
may have been built on more than just practicalities.


171
0:12:10,8 --> 0:12:15,6
It may have been influenced by personal agendas.


172
0:12:15,6 --> 0:12:18,4
I'm not sure that it was the right decision.


173
0:12:18,4 --> 0:12:21,96
Robin Riddles was a frustrated steam locomotive designer,


174
0:12:21,96 --> 0:12:29,4
who couldn't wait to actually get in there and design his own locomotives.


175
0:12:29,4 --> 0:12:31,84
For many of the people working in BR,


176
0:12:31,84 --> 0:12:35,4
it was hard to imagine a railway without steam.


177
0:12:35,4 --> 0:12:37,72
Beginning more than a century ago,


178
0:12:37,72 --> 0:12:40,6
it had helped to make Britain strong.


179
0:12:40,6 --> 0:12:45,48
For many who had grown up with it, steam WAS the railways.


180
0:12:45,48 --> 0:12:49,96
The train was the first sign of modernisation, pre-dating the car, of course.


181
0:12:49,96 --> 0:12:53,76
A steam train went to every corner of the country.


182
0:12:53,76 --> 0:12:56,84
They were the first thing that knitted Britain together.


183
0:12:56,84 --> 0:13:0,28
Everything about the railway was modern. It was new.


184
0:13:0,28 --> 0:13:3,12
We really can't understand what it was like to live


185
0:13:3,12 --> 0:13:6,56
in a predominantly rural society, when these great iron horses


186
0:13:6,56 --> 0:13:9,36
were crashing through, saying to people,


187
0:13:9,36 --> 0:13:12,48
"This is the future, you've got to get used to it."


188
0:13:12,48 --> 0:13:15,92
The engines themselves became cultural phenomena -


189
0:13:15,92 --> 0:13:20,4
heroic machines designed with fearful symmetry.


190
0:13:20,4 --> 0:13:24,44
Some famous engines became household names. The Flying Scotsman


191
0:13:24,44 --> 0:13:33,4
and Mallard, the fastest steam locomotive of all time.


192
0:13:33,4 --> 0:13:37,96
British Railways' decision to stick with steam after World War II meant that new locomotives


193
0:13:37,96 --> 0:13:41,36
had to be built, in places like Darlington Sheds,


194
0:13:41,36 --> 0:13:44,76
one of the oldest railway workshops in the world.


195
0:13:44,76 --> 0:13:53,8
You're OK, we can come down.


196
0:13:53,8 --> 0:13:54,88
60 years after nationalisation,


197
0:13:54,88 --> 0:13:59,68
a new locomotive, called Tornado, is nearing completion.


198
0:13:59,68 --> 0:14:5,56
It's known as an A1 Class and it's cost £3 million to build.


199
0:14:5,56 --> 0:14:9,12
This is a 160 tonne,


200
0:14:9,12 --> 0:14:11,8
90mph steam locomotive,


201
0:14:11,8 --> 0:14:17,88
capable of developing something in the region of 2,600 horse power.


202
0:14:17,88 --> 0:14:22,16
There'd been 49 of them built, during a period of 1948 to '49.


203
0:14:22,16 --> 0:14:27,12
It was the sort of engine that hauled the fastest trains from King's Cross


204
0:14:27,12 --> 0:14:28,64
to Newcastle and Edinburgh.


205
0:14:28,64 --> 0:14:33,24
The major things that they achieved, compared with the pre-war engines,


206
0:14:33,24 --> 0:14:36,72
were improvement in maintenance requirement.


207
0:14:36,72 --> 0:14:41,6
Easier to turn around and service, would run on less good quality coal,


208
0:14:41,6 --> 0:14:48,36
and would run longer between major overhauls.


209
0:14:48,36 --> 0:14:53,8
It would've been expected that these would've been in frontline service for 35-40 years,


210
0:14:53,8 --> 0:14:56,68
as their predecessors had been.


211
0:14:56,68 --> 0:15:7,8
That's it.


212
0:15:7,8 --> 0:15:10,72
The A1 class is a Pacific.


213
0:15:10,72 --> 0:15:14,84
And Pacific means that it's got four small wheels at the front,


214
0:15:14,84 --> 0:15:16,68
which are just carrying weight,


215
0:15:16,68 --> 0:15:21,6
six large driving wheels, and finally two small wheels at the back.


216
0:15:21,6 --> 0:15:26,72
One of the key features which goes right the way back to the Flying Scotsman in 1922


217
0:15:26,72 --> 0:15:31,24
is the wide firebox which goes right to the edge of the running plate.


218
0:15:31,24 --> 0:15:35,16
And on this, there's 50 square feet of grate fire.


219
0:15:35,16 --> 0:15:42,92
That's somewhat bigger than the pre-war engines, which were 41.5 square feet.


220
0:15:42,92 --> 0:15:46,28
The locomotive is equipped with Walschaerts valve gear,


221
0:15:46,28 --> 0:15:50,16
which is driven through a series of rods and levers,


222
0:15:50,16 --> 0:15:54,4
through this device here, called the radius link.


223
0:15:54,4 --> 0:15:58,8
Now, this is the essentially clever part of the steam locomotive,


224
0:15:58,8 --> 0:16:1,56
which avoids the use of gears.


225
0:16:1,56 --> 0:16:5,44
And as you start moving quicker, you gradually wind this in,


226
0:16:5,44 --> 0:16:9,32
so that by the time the engine is cruising at 70mph,


227
0:16:9,32 --> 0:16:12,92
you're probably only actually admitting steam into the cylinders


228
0:16:12,92 --> 0:16:18,8
for about 15% of the total stroke of each piston.


229
0:16:18,8 --> 0:16:20,8
It also explains why when engines start off,


230
0:16:20,8 --> 0:16:24,92
they make a very loud chuffing noise...


231
0:16:24,92 --> 0:16:29,8
Cos you're admitting steam for nearly the whole stroke of the piston,


232
0:16:29,8 --> 0:16:35,16
and then letting out the exhaust, at not much less than boiler pressure.


233
0:16:35,16 --> 0:16:41,56
But as you wind the gear back, you're only letting steam in for a short distance,


234
0:16:41,56 --> 0:16:44,84
so when they're cruising they're making more of a soft beat,


235
0:16:44,84 --> 0:16:56,24
rather than the fierce beat at the start.


236
0:16:56,24 --> 0:17:1,96
Tornado is a new engine, but the design predates British Railways.


237
0:17:1,96 --> 0:17:5,64
Looking forwards as a single, unified organisation,


238
0:17:5,64 --> 0:17:11,6
BR chose to develop a new class of steam locomotive for the future.


239
0:17:11,6 --> 0:17:20,44
Locomotive trials were set up to cherry-pick the best ideas from the big four companies.


240
0:17:20,44 --> 0:17:23,4
We're knocking four railways into one.


241
0:17:23,4 --> 0:17:26,24
That's bound to cause a bit of a clatter!


242
0:17:26,24 --> 0:17:30,2
We're taking the thing a stage further than it had already gone.


243
0:17:30,2 --> 0:17:34,12
To save waste and overlapping, we've got to standardise.


244
0:17:34,12 --> 0:17:36,6
And standardisation


245
0:17:36,6 --> 0:17:40,16
on such a big scale as this can only be done as it comes.


246
0:17:40,16 --> 0:17:45,2
Each railway in the big four group had their own way of doing things.


247
0:17:45,2 --> 0:17:50,84
Now what we have to do is to examine them all and take the best from each.


248
0:17:50,84 --> 0:17:55,24
Everything from carriage bogeys to signalling.


249
0:17:55,24 --> 0:17:58,6
Within two years, designs had been produced for standard


250
0:17:58,6 --> 0:18:2,76
locomotives for the whole of the British railway system.


251
0:18:2,76 --> 0:18:9,16
And they were designed specifically to be as easy to maintain as was possible.


252
0:18:9,16 --> 0:18:14,88
A simple example of that is that a lot of the mainline express locomotives designed


253
0:18:14,88 --> 0:18:17,96
by the big four companies had four cylinders -


254
0:18:17,96 --> 0:18:22,72
you had the two on the outside, and then you had two hidden inside.


255
0:18:22,72 --> 0:18:27,84
And maintaining the inside cylinders was actually very time-consuming and quite difficult.


256
0:18:27,84 --> 0:18:32,96
The decision was taken very early on that all of the steam locomotives


257
0:18:32,96 --> 0:18:37,68
produced for the unified British Railways would all be two-cylinder locomotives.


258
0:18:37,68 --> 0:18:39,88
It would be possible to get to the wheels,


259
0:18:39,88 --> 0:18:43,16
it would be possible to get to the coupling rods and the motion.


260
0:18:43,16 --> 0:18:47,6
You would see, if you had pictures of the standard locomotives,


261
0:18:47,6 --> 0:18:52,48
they weren't necessarily pretty, but they were very accessible.


262
0:18:52,48 --> 0:18:58,8
Over the next decade, 999 Standard Class engines were built,


263
0:18:58,8 --> 0:19:1,84
as well as more than 1,500 non-standard engines.


264
0:19:1,84 --> 0:19:5,52
This great variety of locomotives running on the lines gave rise to


265
0:19:5,52 --> 0:19:11,4
a cultural phenomenon that celebrated this diversity.


266
0:19:11,4 --> 0:19:15,4
Young boys all over the country appeared at railway stations


267
0:19:15,4 --> 0:19:17,68
in droves to catch a glimpse of


268
0:19:17,68 --> 0:19:21,52
the weird and wonderful engines running on Britain's railways.


269
0:19:21,52 --> 0:19:23,88
The spark that ignited


270
0:19:23,88 --> 0:19:27,48
the train-spotting revolution was Ian Allan's


271
0:19:27,48 --> 0:19:29,96
ABC Guide to Southern Locomotives,


272
0:19:29,96 --> 0:19:34,36
which was published in 1942, when he was 15.


273
0:19:34,36 --> 0:19:38,28
What it is, it's a list of numbers, which doesn't sound very exciting,


274
0:19:38,28 --> 0:19:43,92
it's not a great read, but the point is that you take it out onto the end of the platform,


275
0:19:43,92 --> 0:19:48,6
and you wait to tick off the engines as they come past.


276
0:19:48,6 --> 0:19:51,84
And it became very popular amongst teenage boys.


277
0:19:51,84 --> 0:19:56,96
It was kind of the iPod of its generation.


278
0:19:56,96 --> 0:20:0,12
Train spotting in 1942 was hip.


279
0:20:0,12 --> 0:20:3,84
It's unthinkable now, but it was.


280
0:20:3,84 --> 0:20:8,96
During the war, Ian Allan was working for the PR department at Waterloo Station,


281
0:20:8,96 --> 0:20:12,8
answering letters from the public asking for information


282
0:20:12,8 --> 0:20:14,8
about Southern Railways engines and carriages.


283
0:20:14,8 --> 0:20:17,0
One of my chores


284
0:20:17,0 --> 0:20:23,44
was to deal with letters from the public, asking for information


285
0:20:23,44 --> 0:20:29,24
relating to locomotive names and numbers and principal dimensions.


286
0:20:29,24 --> 0:20:32,72
It was then that I said, "Well, why go to all this trouble


287
0:20:32,72 --> 0:20:35,8
"writing separate letters to people?


288
0:20:35,8 --> 0:20:40,88
"We should do this book which would encompass the whole thing."


289
0:20:40,88 --> 0:20:46,44
The book contained all of the information about Southern Railway trains that the enthusiast needed.


290
0:20:46,44 --> 0:20:50,8
Engine classes, numbers and dimensions.


291
0:20:50,8 --> 0:20:52,44
The first run sold out immediately.


292
0:20:52,44 --> 0:20:57,6
He published guides to other regions and train spotting took off.


293
0:20:57,6 --> 0:21:1,4
There was very little else on the market


294
0:21:1,4 --> 0:21:5,44
for boys or girls to participate in.


295
0:21:5,44 --> 0:21:10,52
Because...there wasn't anything on during the war.


296
0:21:10,52 --> 0:21:13,24
Everything was on a war basis.


297
0:21:13,24 --> 0:21:18,4
And here was something that they could go down to the local station,


298
0:21:18,4 --> 0:21:21,36
and watch the trains.


299
0:21:21,36 --> 0:21:25,2
Railways did have a romance attached to them,


300
0:21:25,2 --> 0:21:28,52
they were in a sense a hangover from the great Victorian period.


301
0:21:28,52 --> 0:21:32,72
There was a sort of a wonderful permanence about the permanent way.


302
0:21:32,72 --> 0:21:36,4
It was efficient. It did on the whole run on time,


303
0:21:36,4 --> 0:21:39,44
it brought everything and took everything away.


304
0:21:39,44 --> 0:21:43,68
The platform, the greeting, the departing, the arriving,


305
0:21:43,68 --> 0:21:48,44
everything about the station and the train was exciting, particularly to children.


306
0:21:48,44 --> 0:21:56,56
So it's not surprising that it attracted the romantic attachment that train spotting represented.


307
0:21:56,56 --> 0:21:59,52
Don't you like to do anything else but the railways?


308
0:21:59,52 --> 0:22:2,64
Well, yeah, there's girls and horses and...


309
0:22:2,64 --> 0:22:5,6
Yeah, there's other things, but steam engines are nice,


310
0:22:5,6 --> 0:22:9,44
you feel you have to have a steam engine, every now and again.


311
0:22:9,44 --> 0:22:13,8
All these chaps say the same, they've got to have a steam engine.


312
0:22:13,8 --> 0:22:16,8
You might be able to go a fortnight, then you've got to find one.


313
0:22:16,8 --> 0:22:19,4
That thing's got a voice, it's making a noise,


314
0:22:19,4 --> 0:22:22,24
it's speaking, it's a terrific noise, it makes...


315
0:22:22,24 --> 0:22:24,16
Well, it just makes lovely noises.


316
0:22:24,16 --> 0:22:27,8
When it's raising steam, 90 tons of it,


317
0:22:27,8 --> 0:22:32,24
it sings like a kettle, it's terrific, a lovely thing!


318
0:22:32,24 --> 0:22:36,76
Train spotting was at the heart of British culture for decades.


319
0:22:36,76 --> 0:22:41,8
Far from being the anorak activity that its reputation now has,


320
0:22:41,8 --> 0:22:42,88
it was a social activity,


321
0:22:42,88 --> 0:22:48,24
a way for youngsters to meet.


322
0:22:48,24 --> 0:22:52,32
One group of young lads used to meet up in Southall in London


323
0:22:52,32 --> 0:22:55,16
to share their passion for the railways.


324
0:22:55,16 --> 0:22:59,88
I suppose it's interesting how we all got together, we met, which was


325
0:22:59,88 --> 0:23:3,92
basically Southall, the railway bridge, as far as I'm concerned.


326
0:23:3,92 --> 0:23:8,88
The footbridge was a meeting place for us, evenings, weekends.


327
0:23:8,88 --> 0:23:11,44
It was a social gathering point.


328
0:23:11,44 --> 0:23:14,0
Exactly. There was always somebody there.


329
0:23:14,0 --> 0:23:18,52
I often hear this mimicked in today's society, "Oh, there wasn't a lot to do."


330
0:23:18,52 --> 0:23:21,6
But in fairness, in the late '50s, early '60s,


331
0:23:21,6 --> 0:23:23,76
there wasn't a great deal to do.


332
0:23:23,76 --> 0:23:27,4
And we had to find our own fun.


333
0:23:27,4 --> 0:23:33,0
Well, you'd arrive on the bike, park up your bike on the bridge.


334
0:23:33,0 --> 0:23:37,36
Erm, possibly stock up with frozen Jubbly and...


335
0:23:37,36 --> 0:23:39,36
Frozen Jubblies, yes! Ha ha!


336
0:23:39,36 --> 0:23:42,88
I mean, you could see right the way down the line as far as Hanwell,


337
0:23:42,88 --> 0:23:46,0
so you could see trains coming well over a mile away,


338
0:23:46,0 --> 0:23:49,36
and there was this sort of crescendo as they approached.


339
0:23:49,36 --> 0:23:52,84
And then the thrill of the thing going past, getting the number...


340
0:23:52,84 --> 0:23:55,64
- Smoke and steam. 
- Seeing what sort of train it was,


341
0:23:55,64 --> 0:24:1,32
it might have been a milk train, might have been a parcels or goods...


342
0:24:1,32 --> 0:24:5,0
Many of the pre-war trains were still running on the main lines,


343
0:24:5,0 --> 0:24:7,12
as well as the new standard classes.


344
0:24:7,12 --> 0:24:10,32
Locomotive diversity was at its height.


345
0:24:10,32 --> 0:24:12,84
There was more to see than there is now.


346
0:24:12,84 --> 0:24:15,2
There were different kinds of locomotives.


347
0:24:15,2 --> 0:24:19,96
Now, there are only three or four of the motive units that we might see.


348
0:24:19,96 --> 0:24:23,72
Then you'd see lots and lots of different engines.


349
0:24:23,72 --> 0:24:27,64
Pre-nationalisation, the coaches would have different liveries,


350
0:24:27,64 --> 0:24:31,28
it was easier to get to see really quite odd things.


351
0:24:31,28 --> 0:24:34,0
You would see little tank engines doing jobs,


352
0:24:34,0 --> 0:24:36,24
or big steam engines coming through.


353
0:24:36,24 --> 0:24:40,76
So there were lots more things to see.


354
0:24:40,76 --> 0:24:43,76
The nation's youth celebrated the new steam age.


355
0:24:43,76 --> 0:24:49,64
Britain's romantic view of steam appeared to be as strong as ever.


356
0:24:49,64 --> 0:24:54,0
The romance that people attached to it very rarely applied to the actual workers.


357
0:24:54,0 --> 0:24:58,0
Nothing illustrates the ambivalence of the British towards modernisation


358
0:24:58,0 --> 0:25:0,52
so much as their attitude towards a steam train.


359
0:25:0,52 --> 0:25:2,44
No, they wouldn't do it themselves.


360
0:25:2,44 --> 0:25:7,56
But, yes, they wanted someone else to do it, because they rather liked the romance of it.


361
0:25:7,56 --> 0:25:10,96
As a teenager, Peter Gransden worked for British Railways


362
0:25:10,96 --> 0:25:15,4
stoking the fires on locomotives in the last years of steam.


363
0:25:15,4 --> 0:25:17,24
The only light thing on the railways


364
0:25:17,24 --> 0:25:18,8
was the wage packet.


365
0:25:18,8 --> 0:25:21,2
Everything else was pretty hard.


366
0:25:21,2 --> 0:25:24,64
Some jobs were easy, but the majority of actually running


367
0:25:24,64 --> 0:25:27,0
the railway were very difficult jobs.


368
0:25:27,0 --> 0:25:31,88
You know, not much money and long hours.


369
0:25:31,88 --> 0:25:35,16
The fireman, he literally looks after the fire


370
0:25:35,16 --> 0:25:39,12
and also looks after the water in the boiler for making steam,


371
0:25:39,12 --> 0:25:41,84
and he also has to look out for the signals,


372
0:25:41,84 --> 0:25:47,8
because the driver is on the opposite side of the train to where the signals are.


373
0:25:47,8 --> 0:25:51,2
So he has quite a lot to do. Yeah, it was dirty.


374
0:25:51,2 --> 0:25:55,36
I mean, you got bloody filthy.


375
0:25:55,36 --> 0:25:58,8
And, like, you had no washing facilities on the sheds,


376
0:25:58,8 --> 0:26:1,48
and you had a bucket, and you filled the bucket up


377
0:26:1,48 --> 0:26:4,92
from the overflow from the injectors, you'd get a bar of soap,


378
0:26:4,92 --> 0:26:7,52
and you'd have the best wash you could from that.


379
0:26:7,52 --> 0:26:10,56
And if you was on some turns, and you were going out


380
0:26:10,56 --> 0:26:14,12
with your girlfriend of an evening, you'd get as much dirt off


381
0:26:14,12 --> 0:26:17,4
as you could and hope it didn't rain because if it rained


382
0:26:17,4 --> 0:26:20,2
you'd have all dirty streaks down your face out of your hair!


383
0:26:20,2 --> 0:26:28,0
Which didn't look very good, really.


384
0:26:28,0 --> 0:26:30,56
As time wore on, it wasn't just the railwaymen


385
0:26:30,56 --> 0:26:33,56
who had had enough of the dirty Victorian technology.


386
0:26:33,56 --> 0:26:40,4
The general British public were starting to tire of it as well.


387
0:26:40,4 --> 0:26:45,4
In the immediate years after the war, rail was the only option for long distance travel.


388
0:26:45,4 --> 0:26:50,64
During the '50s, what happened was that the railways were slow,


389
0:26:50,64 --> 0:26:53,36
they weren't desperately keen.


390
0:26:53,36 --> 0:26:57,44
Most people took their holidays from Saturday to Saturday


391
0:26:57,44 --> 0:27:0,4
over eight or nine weeks in the summer.


392
0:27:0,4 --> 0:27:3,64
The railways actually couldn't handle the development


393
0:27:3,64 --> 0:27:9,28
of holidays with pay, as it became known in the early 1950s.


394
0:27:9,28 --> 0:27:13,52
And many people and many families' only experience of long-distance rail travel


395
0:27:13,52 --> 0:27:17,32
was on summer Saturdays in dirty, clapped-out coaches


396
0:27:17,32 --> 0:27:19,52
with trains running increasingly late.


397
0:27:19,52 --> 0:27:22,56
And as soon as they had the opportunity to buy a family car,


398
0:27:22,56 --> 0:27:25,4
they just never travelled on the train at all.


399
0:27:25,4 --> 0:27:28,96
They may have done if they were commuting to work in London or another city.


400
0:27:28,96 --> 0:27:32,88
But the thought of getting on the train to go on your holidays,


401
0:27:32,88 --> 0:27:37,72
by the mid 1960s, fewer and fewer people did so.


402
0:27:37,72 --> 0:27:41,56
Not only was BR losing its public, but also their freight services


403
0:27:41,56 --> 0:27:46,56
were increasingly in decline, as more goods were transported by road.


404
0:27:46,56 --> 0:27:51,92
British Railways ceased to be a profitable company.


405
0:27:51,92 --> 0:27:55,4
Well, quite simply, what happened in 1948 to 1955


406
0:27:55,4 --> 0:27:57,64
is that British Rail began to lose money.


407
0:27:57,64 --> 0:28:1,92
It began to register operating deficits,


408
0:28:1,92 --> 0:28:6,8
having not done so previously, and it was


409
0:28:6,8 --> 0:28:10,8
being challenged by road transport, both on the freight side,


410
0:28:10,8 --> 0:28:13,0
and on the passenger side, for the first time.


411
0:28:13,0 --> 0:28:15,24
And I think, therefore,


412
0:28:15,24 --> 0:28:19,16
this is the origin of what was called the British Rail problem.


413
0:28:19,16 --> 0:28:23,28
And I think this informs attitudes to motive power.


414
0:28:23,28 --> 0:28:26,28
How can we get operating costs down?


415
0:28:26,28 --> 0:28:31,16
And one of the ways that one could do that was to replace steam with diesel.


416
0:28:31,16 --> 0:28:35,88
After the war, it had not been seen as cost effective to leave


417
0:28:35,88 --> 0:28:39,2
steam behind because coal was still cheap and plentiful.


418
0:28:39,2 --> 0:28:42,68
Within a few years, coal prices were on the rise,


419
0:28:42,68 --> 0:28:44,92
and oil prices were dropping.


420
0:28:44,92 --> 0:28:49,6
The time had come to make the big switch to diesel power.


421
0:28:49,6 --> 0:28:54,0
By the middle of the 1950s it was becoming apparent that steam was not


422
0:28:54,0 --> 0:28:57,4
going to be easy to perpetuate. Several things were working


423
0:28:57,4 --> 0:29:0,96
against it. The price of coal was going up fairly dramatically.


424
0:29:0,96 --> 0:29:4,92
Of course, steam locomotives are messy things that tend to need


425
0:29:4,92 --> 0:29:8,72
maintenance 24 hours a day, and it was becoming more and more difficult


426
0:29:8,72 --> 0:29:10,24
to get people to work on them.


427
0:29:10,24 --> 0:29:13,72
In 1955, the British Transport Commission,


428
0:29:13,72 --> 0:29:18,28
which by that point had taken over all responsibility for


429
0:29:18,28 --> 0:29:20,6
strategic planning on the railway,


430
0:29:20,6 --> 0:29:25,8
announced a modernisation plan to spend really quite considerable


431
0:29:25,8 --> 0:29:27,88
amounts of capital for modernisation of the railways.


432
0:29:27,88 --> 0:29:31,52
A key element of the plan was the abolition of steam traction


433
0:29:31,52 --> 0:29:35,96
because it was now felt that diesel traction had developed


434
0:29:35,96 --> 0:29:38,6
to the point where it was a viable, workable technology.


435
0:29:38,6 --> 0:29:40,88
And also that there should be some


436
0:29:40,88 --> 0:29:44,68
large-scale electrification of Britain's main lines.


437
0:29:44,68 --> 0:29:49,4
So by the mid-1950s it was widely recognised within the industry and


438
0:29:49,4 --> 0:29:52,88
outside the industry that steam traction was coming


439
0:29:52,88 --> 0:29:55,4
to the end of its useful life.


440
0:29:55,4 --> 0:29:57,24
Steam overreached itself.


441
0:29:57,24 --> 0:30:1,72
The world moved on, and steam paid little heed to change.


442
0:30:1,72 --> 0:30:3,76
In the kingdom of the railways,


443
0:30:3,76 --> 0:30:7,12
diesel and electric have usurped the throne.


444
0:30:7,12 --> 0:30:9,68
The glory of steam is played out.


445
0:30:9,68 --> 0:30:14,84
Finished. Gone.


446
0:30:14,84 --> 0:30:17,48
Despite the fact that nearly 2,000 standard


447
0:30:17,48 --> 0:30:20,76
and non-standard engines had been built by the mid '50s,


448
0:30:20,76 --> 0:30:27,0
the writing was on the wall for steam power.


449
0:30:27,0 --> 0:30:30,96
British Railways were promised a new lease of life.


450
0:30:30,96 --> 0:30:33,84
A vast modernisation plan to be carried out


451
0:30:33,84 --> 0:30:39,0
over 15 years at a cost of more than £1,500 million.


452
0:30:39,0 --> 0:30:46,84
The days of the grand old steam locomotives were numbered.


453
0:30:46,84 --> 0:30:50,72
These sleek new giants began to take their place.


454
0:30:50,72 --> 0:30:54,6
The transition from steam to newer forms of traction


455
0:30:54,6 --> 0:30:57,4
was not an altogether smooth one.


456
0:30:57,4 --> 0:30:59,12
HORN BLOWS


457
0:30:59,12 --> 0:31:1,12
The result was, on the one hand,


458
0:31:1,12 --> 0:31:4,88
that the rate of withdrawal of steam traction increased.


459
0:31:4,88 --> 0:31:9,2
So steam locomotives were taken out of service more and more rapidly.


460
0:31:9,2 --> 0:31:11,56
But the new diesels often broke down.


461
0:31:11,56 --> 0:31:15,36
They were often unreliable, or some of them were unreliable.


462
0:31:15,36 --> 0:31:20,0
So quite often in the late 1950s and early 1960s, British Railways


463
0:31:20,0 --> 0:31:23,0
was faced with the unenviable image


464
0:31:23,0 --> 0:31:27,44
of brand-new diesel locomotives being hauled back,


465
0:31:27,44 --> 0:31:30,4
rescued, as it were, from breakdowns


466
0:31:30,4 --> 0:31:35,28
by the old-fashioned steam locomotive.


467
0:31:35,28 --> 0:31:37,64
The passing of steam was happening.


468
0:31:37,64 --> 0:31:39,84
Even the railway enthusiasts could see


469
0:31:39,84 --> 0:31:42,8
that the age of steam could not carry on.


470
0:31:42,8 --> 0:31:44,64
The age of steam had to finish


471
0:31:44,64 --> 0:31:49,56
because it is an inefficient means of transportation.


472
0:31:49,56 --> 0:31:51,52
Burning coal to turn water into steam


473
0:31:51,52 --> 0:31:53,28
is very, very, very inefficient.


474
0:31:53,28 --> 0:31:56,4
It's dirty, and it's manpower intensive,


475
0:31:56,4 --> 0:32:1,36
and I don't think it could've survived into the 21st century.


476
0:32:1,36 --> 0:32:3,96
Even if they'd had the will to do so.


477
0:32:3,96 --> 0:32:7,88
Steam was dirty, noisy and impractical.


478
0:32:7,88 --> 0:32:10,4
New diesels were clean, safe and quiet.


479
0:32:10,4 --> 0:32:13,56
For many of the people working on the trains every day,


480
0:32:13,56 --> 0:32:17,64
the end of steam could not come soon enough.


481
0:32:17,64 --> 0:32:20,92
Bill, how do you like driving one of these new diesels?


482
0:32:20,92 --> 0:32:24,44
Oh, I like them very much, I think they're a driver's dream, you know.


483
0:32:24,44 --> 0:32:28,32
It's vastly different altogether to the old steam engine,


484
0:32:28,32 --> 0:32:29,64
they're much cleaner.


485
0:32:29,64 --> 0:32:32,24
Do you get as much satisfaction out of the job


486
0:32:32,24 --> 0:32:35,12
- as you did driving the old steam locos? 
- I think so,


487
0:32:35,12 --> 0:32:37,52
and as a matter of fact, now I'm used to it,


488
0:32:37,52 --> 0:32:41,24
I get more satisfaction. Why I say that is because,


489
0:32:41,24 --> 0:32:45,4
with the old steam engine with its faults and that,


490
0:32:45,4 --> 0:32:48,12
we did have some difficulty in maintaining the schedule


491
0:32:48,12 --> 0:32:49,2
when we got behind,


492
0:32:49,2 --> 0:32:52,6
but owing to the enormous amount of reserve power that


493
0:32:52,6 --> 0:32:55,24
we've got with these, we can pick up


494
0:32:55,24 --> 0:33:1,84
quite a lot of time and maintain an on-time schedule.


495
0:33:1,84 --> 0:33:7,8
The modernisation plan had promised an end to steam-powered locomotives,


496
0:33:7,8 --> 0:33:14,64
but steam engines carried on being built for several years.


497
0:33:14,64 --> 0:33:19,64
British Railways continued to make steam locomotives until 1960.


498
0:33:19,64 --> 0:33:22,88
The modernisation plan of 1955 had said that steam locomotives


499
0:33:22,88 --> 0:33:26,96
will eventually be eliminated, though it didn't give a timescale.


500
0:33:26,96 --> 0:33:32,84
And the steam locomotives that were being built into 1960 had,


501
0:33:32,84 --> 0:33:36,44
essentially, a useful life of between 25 and 30 years.


502
0:33:36,44 --> 0:33:40,56
And it wasn't until March 1960 that the last steam locomotive


503
0:33:40,56 --> 0:33:43,56
was built for Britain's mainline railways.


504
0:33:43,56 --> 0:33:46,92
It was built at Swindon, and in the tradition


505
0:33:46,92 --> 0:33:51,16
of the Great Western Railway and Swindon Works of naming engines after


506
0:33:51,16 --> 0:33:58,28
the stars in the heavens, it was called, appropriately, Evening Star.


507
0:33:58,28 --> 0:34:2,24
Evening Star was, in many ways, a normal steam engine,


508
0:34:2,24 --> 0:34:6,2
built to haul heavy freight and passenger trains.


509
0:34:6,2 --> 0:34:9,56
But the men who built and named her knew the significance she held.


510
0:34:9,56 --> 0:34:16,2
The ceremony to launch Evening Star was a sombre and poignant affair.


511
0:34:16,2 --> 0:34:19,64
And d'you know, the incredible thing about Evening Star


512
0:34:19,64 --> 0:34:24,72
is, having been completed in 1960, it was out of service by 1965.


513
0:34:24,72 --> 0:34:28,28
Five years' work, just gives you an idea of the, almost the...


514
0:34:28,28 --> 0:34:32,32
if not undue haste, certainly the ill-planned haste


515
0:34:32,32 --> 0:34:35,76
with which the transition to steam and diesel took place.


516
0:34:35,76 --> 0:34:40,4
HORN BLOWS


517
0:34:40,4 --> 0:34:42,88
There was this assumption that steam would keep going


518
0:34:42,88 --> 0:34:44,6
until the early or the mid 1970s,


519
0:34:44,6 --> 0:34:47,4
so it wasn't completely crackers


520
0:34:47,4 --> 0:34:50,24
to build Evening Star, on that assumption.


521
0:34:50,24 --> 0:34:52,44
But what happens is, you get this shift


522
0:34:52,44 --> 0:34:54,52
at the end of the '50s where they say,


523
0:34:54,52 --> 0:34:57,0
"Well, we've got to build diesels


524
0:34:57,0 --> 0:34:59,8
"because they're going to be cheaper,"


525
0:34:59,8 --> 0:35:1,52
and there's this momentum.


526
0:35:1,52 --> 0:35:6,12
You can't just stop construction programmes just like that.


527
0:35:6,12 --> 0:35:11,6
The unions object, this kind of thing.


528
0:35:11,6 --> 0:35:15,84
Perfectly good steam trains started to be taken off the railway


529
0:35:15,84 --> 0:35:17,44
and out of use for ever.


530
0:35:17,44 --> 0:35:21,0
The locomotives and carriages were sent to scrap yards.


531
0:35:21,0 --> 0:35:24,8
But BR recognised the importance to the nation's heritage in some


532
0:35:24,8 --> 0:35:26,64
of these locomotive engines,


533
0:35:26,64 --> 0:35:31,0
and decided to save a number of them for posterity.


534
0:35:31,0 --> 0:35:34,88
British Railways produced a list of the 71 steam locomotives


535
0:35:34,88 --> 0:35:36,96
it felt ought to be preserved.


536
0:35:36,96 --> 0:35:41,32
That was a huge commitment, because they weren't thinking about


537
0:35:41,32 --> 0:35:45,6
populating a whole network of heritage railways. This was...


538
0:35:45,6 --> 0:35:49,16
Their perception was of static museums.


539
0:35:49,16 --> 0:35:53,56
I think it's a pretty long list rather than a short one, when you


540
0:35:53,56 --> 0:35:59,28
consider what they were committing future generations to holding on to.


541
0:35:59,28 --> 0:36:2,8
The list of 71 contained many well known engines,


542
0:36:2,8 --> 0:36:5,16
covering steam's long history.


543
0:36:5,16 --> 0:36:7,68
But most were from the previous century,


544
0:36:7,68 --> 0:36:12,36
ignoring the working locomotives known and loved by trains potters.


545
0:36:12,36 --> 0:36:17,8
Some enthusiasts were bound to be disappointed.


546
0:36:17,8 --> 0:36:19,96
Well, I think we got together on the footbridge,


547
0:36:19,96 --> 0:36:23,4
and we though we'd better have a meeting about this.


548
0:36:23,4 --> 0:36:26,56
So we had this meeting and, because I'd got a typewriter,


549
0:36:26,56 --> 0:36:31,84
I said, "Well, I'll write a letter to The Railway Magazine."


550
0:36:31,84 --> 0:36:35,6
The letter called for donations from fellow enthusiasts


551
0:36:35,6 --> 0:36:38,8
to buy a 14XX steam engine from British Railways.


552
0:36:38,8 --> 0:36:40,4
A couple of months went by,


553
0:36:40,4 --> 0:36:43,24
and to be fair, we may have thought, "Ah, well,


554
0:36:43,24 --> 0:36:46,2
"it's not gonna happen, but it's nice while it lasted."


555
0:36:46,2 --> 0:36:50,16
And I was on holiday in the Lake District, on a camping holiday,


556
0:36:50,16 --> 0:36:53,96
and my post was forwarded to me by my mother,


557
0:36:53,96 --> 0:36:57,48
and I opened up this envelope in the middle of the Lake District,


558
0:36:57,48 --> 0:36:59,72
to find a £10 cheque in it from somebody,


559
0:36:59,72 --> 0:37:3,88
subscribing to my appeal for the money to buy this engine,


560
0:37:3,88 --> 0:37:5,84
and I thought, "Goodness!


561
0:37:5,84 --> 0:37:12,4
- "What are we gonna do now?!" 
- Yeah, what are we gonna do now, yeah!


562
0:37:12,4 --> 0:37:15,56
Within a few months, they had received enough money


563
0:37:15,56 --> 0:37:20,4
to buy the engine and begin restoring it.


564
0:37:20,4 --> 0:37:22,24
Well, it's not looking so bad.


565
0:37:22,24 --> 0:37:26,64
Although, er, how many hundred pounds did we have to pay for it now?


566
0:37:26,64 --> 0:37:29,52
- 950. 
- No, six hundred and...


567
0:37:29,52 --> 0:37:31,68
I think it was £690.


568
0:37:31,68 --> 0:37:33,84
There was certainly change out of £1,000.


569
0:37:33,84 --> 0:37:38,8
And a £50 delivery charge, I think.


570
0:37:38,8 --> 0:37:44,56
Dear me! So...!


571
0:37:44,56 --> 0:37:48,32
Then we thought, where are we gonna put it?


572
0:37:48,32 --> 0:37:52,92
You know, who's got the biggest back garden?


573
0:37:52,92 --> 0:37:55,84
We had a steam engine, a good steam engine, that worked.


574
0:37:55,84 --> 0:37:59,24
And we thought, "Well, we wanna make it work."


575
0:37:59,24 --> 0:38:1,12
None of us had ever driven a steam engine,


576
0:38:1,12 --> 0:38:2,88
didn't know how to light it up.


577
0:38:2,88 --> 0:38:5,36
Eventually, we found somebody


578
0:38:5,36 --> 0:38:18,36
who could give us some advice. 


579
0:38:18,36 --> 0:38:21,2
Literally, we steamed this engine on a bit of track,


580
0:38:21,2 --> 0:38:22,96
which had a road right next to it.


581
0:38:22,96 --> 0:38:26,36
We were puffing this engine up and down.


582
0:38:26,36 --> 0:38:30,76
I've always thought, right from the earliest days of the society, that,


583
0:38:30,76 --> 0:38:33,4
erm, because we were 16,


584
0:38:33,4 --> 0:38:38,8
we weren't experts at raising funds, buying railway engines,


585
0:38:38,8 --> 0:38:40,6
doing any of this type of thing.


586
0:38:40,6 --> 0:38:42,88
And I think that meant that we had no conception


587
0:38:42,88 --> 0:38:47,56
of the fact that probably what we were trying to do wasn't possible.


588
0:38:47,56 --> 0:38:59,96
Which is why we went on and did it.


589
0:38:59,96 --> 0:39:2,88
The Southall boys were not alone in their crusade.


590
0:39:2,88 --> 0:39:9,12
Others were racing against the clock to preserve steam's heritage.


591
0:39:9,12 --> 0:39:13,12
The axing of trains and lines continued apace.


592
0:39:13,12 --> 0:39:15,8
The modernisation plan hadn't worked.


593
0:39:15,8 --> 0:39:24,24
The railways were losing more money than ever.


594
0:39:24,24 --> 0:39:27,4
Well, from the mid '50s, things began to change.


595
0:39:27,4 --> 0:39:31,44
There was no fuel rationing affecting private motoring,


596
0:39:31,44 --> 0:39:37,52
road transport began to get a great impetus from new road building, culminating


597
0:39:37,52 --> 0:39:42,48
in the first motorway, the M1, in 1959.


598
0:39:42,48 --> 0:39:45,84
It was a period of economic prosperity.


599
0:39:45,84 --> 0:39:48,8
It was important that the railways didn't fall behind.


600
0:39:48,8 --> 0:39:54,32
But one could say that they were already in a difficult position.


601
0:39:54,32 --> 0:39:57,72
Within the Ministry of Transport, there was a feeling that road


602
0:39:57,72 --> 0:40:3,52
transport was important to invest in because rail transport was declining.


603
0:40:3,52 --> 0:40:7,0
It was certainly losing market share.


604
0:40:7,0 --> 0:40:11,92
The Beeching report of 1963 advocated the closure


605
0:40:11,92 --> 0:40:14,8
of money-losing regional lines,


606
0:40:14,8 --> 0:40:17,84
and speeded up the changeover to diesel powered trains.


607
0:40:17,84 --> 0:40:20,0
Of course, some of you will say,


608
0:40:20,0 --> 0:40:23,4
"Well, what about all this modernisation?


609
0:40:23,4 --> 0:40:26,4
"Can't we have the branch lines as well?


610
0:40:26,4 --> 0:40:31,24
"Can't you attract enough traffic to them to make them pay?"


611
0:40:31,24 --> 0:40:32,8
But unfortunately, we can't.


612
0:40:32,8 --> 0:40:35,52
We cannot make them pay,


613
0:40:35,52 --> 0:40:40,2
because the traffic is not there, and so many people have motor cars.


614
0:40:40,2 --> 0:40:45,32
The real question is whether you, as owners of the railways, want us


615
0:40:45,32 --> 0:40:48,8
to go on running these services, at very high cost,


616
0:40:48,8 --> 0:40:53,0
when the demand for them has very largely disappeared.


617
0:40:53,0 --> 0:40:55,92
Steam was being withdrawn at a time


618
0:40:55,92 --> 0:41:0,2
when the nature of the railway itself was changing.


619
0:41:0,2 --> 0:41:3,88
The railway was now being seen by railway managers


620
0:41:3,88 --> 0:41:5,96
and many politicians alike


621
0:41:5,96 --> 0:41:9,64
as something which would become much more specialised.


622
0:41:9,64 --> 0:41:13,32
The railway would do what it could do best -


623
0:41:13,32 --> 0:41:17,56
fast, inter-city passenger trains, bulk freight trains...


624
0:41:17,56 --> 0:41:20,52
Yes, there was gonna be money for modernisation, but it was going


625
0:41:20,52 --> 0:41:24,8
to be modernisation money spent on a much smaller railway system,


626
0:41:24,8 --> 0:41:27,84
a much more specialised railway system.


627
0:41:27,84 --> 0:41:32,12
To reclaim the market being lost to private motoring,


628
0:41:32,12 --> 0:41:34,2
BR introduced a new and elite service.


629
0:41:34,2 --> 0:41:39,84
Naturally, the ultra-modern trains used diesel engines, not steam.


630
0:41:39,84 --> 0:41:42,64
Luxury Pullmans provide one of the answers.


631
0:41:42,64 --> 0:41:46,44
Here's the first, introduced on the Manchester to London run.


632
0:41:46,44 --> 0:41:48,6
It's good but pricey.


633
0:41:48,6 --> 0:41:51,32
It's already called the Expense Account train.


634
0:41:51,32 --> 0:41:56,52
The coaches are air conditioned and draught proof.


635
0:41:56,52 --> 0:42:2,12
The food is excellent, all cooked in a spotless kitchen.


636
0:42:2,12 --> 0:42:5,4
And as it cruises along comfortably at an average speed of 90mph,


637
0:42:5,4 --> 0:42:13,36
it cocks a snook at the traffic on the M1.


638
0:42:13,36 --> 0:42:17,36
Beeching regarded the electrification of the railway


639
0:42:17,36 --> 0:42:19,72
and the dieselification of the railway, if that's the word,


640
0:42:19,72 --> 0:42:22,68
he regarded it as simply the emblem of modernisation.


641
0:42:22,68 --> 0:42:25,0
The new Britain, the Britain of the '60s,


642
0:42:25,0 --> 0:42:29,96
had nothing to do with this filthy, old technology.


643
0:42:29,96 --> 0:42:31,76
He also had to grapple with the fact


644
0:42:31,76 --> 0:42:35,4
that he was running steam engines on branch lines with no passengers.


645
0:42:35,4 --> 0:42:38,32
And the fact that people appeared to love them hadn't


646
0:42:38,32 --> 0:42:42,4
made them use them. So Beeching saw the end of steam as the advent of


647
0:42:42,4 --> 0:42:45,92
rationalism, as well as of modernisation, in British Industry.


648
0:42:45,92 --> 0:42:49,16
I mean, he wasn't a railwayman himself. He was just sensible.


649
0:42:49,16 --> 0:42:51,88
And he realised this had to be the great battle,


650
0:42:51,88 --> 0:42:58,64
and he fought it and he won it.


651
0:42:58,64 --> 0:43:1,52
The closure of underused branch lines


652
0:43:1,52 --> 0:43:4,64
upset and isolated rural communities.


653
0:43:4,64 --> 0:43:7,6
The final steam services could draw huge crowds,


654
0:43:7,6 --> 0:43:18,2
as people came to lament the passing of an era.


655
0:43:18,2 --> 0:43:22,48
Living appropriately in a station 14 months derelict, Miss Laurence Aston,


656
0:43:22,48 --> 0:43:26,8
35 years a railways worker, broods on the injustice of bureaucracy


657
0:43:26,8 --> 0:43:29,8
and the wrongs of the Great Western Railway.


658
0:43:29,8 --> 0:43:30,76
Were you here when the last train left?


659
0:43:30,76 --> 0:43:34,96
- Yes, I was. 
- Tell me about that.


660
0:43:34,96 --> 0:43:39,2
Well, it was a long train with a big engine, and crowded.


661
0:43:39,2 --> 0:43:41,48
Of course they couldn't crowd it before.


662
0:43:41,48 --> 0:43:45,48
But this was the last trip.


663
0:43:45,48 --> 0:43:49,12
And to most of them, it was just a junket thing, a party,


664
0:43:49,12 --> 0:43:50,92
an excuse to make a noise.


665
0:43:50,92 --> 0:44:4,8
But to me it was like riding behind a hearse, it really was.


666
0:44:4,8 --> 0:44:7,48
Throughout the country, throughout the '60s,


667
0:44:7,48 --> 0:44:10,84
steam was clinically removed from


668
0:44:10,84 --> 0:44:14,32
first railway sheds, but then from complete regions.


669
0:44:14,32 --> 0:44:19,64
For instance, the Western region, which covered an enormous area,


670
0:44:19,64 --> 0:44:24,96
was basically steam free by the end of 1965.


671
0:44:24,96 --> 0:44:28,88
And another one of the last of the 300 steam locomotives


672
0:44:28,88 --> 0:44:32,36
in service with British Railways comes to the end


673
0:44:32,36 --> 0:44:36,76
of the line, to its final resting place in a sidings


674
0:44:36,76 --> 0:44:41,16
which is becoming known as the graveyard of steam.


675
0:44:41,16 --> 0:44:48,48
In one year alone, 500 locomotives, 4,000 coaches, 130,000 wagons


676
0:44:48,48 --> 0:45:0,2
and 250,000 tons of rail were destroyed without sentiment.


677
0:45:0,2 --> 0:45:3,52
David Shepherd is one of Britain's most well known artists,


678
0:45:3,52 --> 0:45:5,6
who made his name painting wildlife.


679
0:45:5,6 --> 0:45:10,52
In 1967, he dropped everything to paint the last days of steam.


680
0:45:10,52 --> 0:45:15,4
In my days as an artist, I had suddenly realised, like everybody else in England


681
0:45:15,4 --> 0:45:17,16
who were interested in railways,


682
0:45:17,16 --> 0:45:18,8
that it was going, and going fast.


683
0:45:18,8 --> 0:45:21,4
And through the eyes of a painter, I thought,


684
0:45:21,4 --> 0:45:22,56
I have to do something about this.


685
0:45:22,56 --> 0:45:24,2
So I got involved with the steam sheds,


686
0:45:24,2 --> 0:45:25,84
Nine Elms and Guildford particularly.


687
0:45:25,84 --> 0:45:28,4
Nine Elms shed was more full of railway enthusiasts


688
0:45:28,4 --> 0:45:29,68
than it was of railwaymen.


689
0:45:29,68 --> 0:45:31,8
It was clamouring with railway enthusiasts,


690
0:45:31,8 --> 0:45:34,52
trying to experience in one way or another the end of steam.


691
0:45:34,52 --> 0:45:36,52
There was no control. I felt sorry for BR, as they


692
0:45:36,52 --> 0:45:39,16
were trying to run a railway while all this was going on!


693
0:45:39,16 --> 0:45:41,48
This one is actually one of my favourites,


694
0:45:41,48 --> 0:45:43,72
in the sense that it's one of the toughest I did.


695
0:45:43,72 --> 0:45:47,64
Three different angles of a circle, which is in itself bloody difficult.


696
0:45:47,64 --> 0:45:49,32
Wheels that way, body that way.


697
0:45:49,32 --> 0:45:52,0
But that's the most valuable part of this painting,


698
0:45:52,0 --> 0:45:54,36
and I don't believe you could get that colour,


699
0:45:54,36 --> 0:45:56,24
sensitivity of colour, in a photograph.


700
0:45:56,24 --> 0:46:0,16
And the dirt, lovely, much more exciting than a red buffer beam.


701
0:46:0,16 --> 0:46:2,0
I don't paint happy railway pictures,


702
0:46:2,0 --> 0:46:5,4
shafts of sunlight coming through a soot-encrusted hole in the roof.


703
0:46:5,4 --> 0:46:8,8
Everything was falling apart, little plays of light


704
0:46:8,8 --> 0:46:9,52
on the oil on the shed floor.


705
0:46:9,52 --> 0:46:11,44
People say, what's that white stripe?


706
0:46:11,44 --> 0:46:16,48
It's the light, the sunlight catching the edge of the inspection pit.


707
0:46:16,48 --> 0:46:19,2
You know, you have to go in and see it, to do that,


708
0:46:19,2 --> 0:46:21,28
it never would have occurred to me.


709
0:46:21,28 --> 0:46:24,8
Happy days, wonderful days. The sheer hell of doing it was,


710
0:46:24,8 --> 0:46:26,44
oh, God, the painting I did at Wilson's sheds,


711
0:46:26,44 --> 0:46:28,36
the snow was coming through the roof.


712
0:46:28,36 --> 0:46:30,28
And it was black by the time it hit the ground!


713
0:46:30,28 --> 0:46:32,92
The main thing was, I was trying to record the last


714
0:46:32,92 --> 0:46:35,76
days of steam through the eyes of an artist, rather than a photographer.


715
0:46:35,76 --> 0:46:37,64
It's the colours that were interesting, not the shape of


716
0:46:37,64 --> 0:46:39,72
the wheels, that didn't matter, cos the camera did that.


717
0:46:39,72 --> 0:46:42,64
That's why those sketches are so valuable to me.


718
0:46:42,64 --> 0:46:45,72
They're not worth any money, but they're irreplaceable to me,


719
0:46:45,72 --> 0:46:49,88
because they were done in the heat of the moment, the dying days of steam.


720
0:46:49,88 --> 0:46:52,24
One of my many rushed visits to Guildford shed,


721
0:46:52,24 --> 0:46:54,2
just down the road from where we lived.


722
0:46:54,2 --> 0:46:56,24
Just at the right moment, I saw this loco,


723
0:46:56,24 --> 0:46:58,92
half in the sun and half in the shadow, just by chance,


724
0:46:58,92 --> 0:47:2,4
and I thought, what an opportunity, with the subtle colours


725
0:47:2,4 --> 0:47:5,0
on a dirty engine, in the sun and in the shade.


726
0:47:5,0 --> 0:47:9,8
And also, I noticed they had cleaned the number around so that they could


727
0:47:9,8 --> 0:47:12,28
at least identify the number of the engine,


728
0:47:12,28 --> 0:47:15,96
otherwise that would have been invisible like everything else.


729
0:47:15,96 --> 0:47:18,4
I think it was premature urge to, of necessity,


730
0:47:18,4 --> 0:47:20,4
go into diesels and electrics.


731
0:47:20,4 --> 0:47:22,6
Steam could have lasted longer, but it wouldn't have done


732
0:47:22,6 --> 0:47:25,4
because you wouldn't get the people to put up with it now,


733
0:47:25,4 --> 0:47:27,0
all the dirt and everything I've described.


734
0:47:27,0 --> 0:47:30,0
People don't want to get filthy dirty when they go to London,


735
0:47:30,0 --> 0:47:33,32
or anywhere for that matter. So it would have died, and it had to die,


736
0:47:33,32 --> 0:47:36,64
but it was just disgusting the way it went out. Get rid of it, filthy.


737
0:47:36,64 --> 0:47:42,4
We should have been proud of our steam engines.


738
0:47:42,4 --> 0:47:45,28
As the engines were removed, jobs went, too.


739
0:47:45,28 --> 0:47:48,96
Some of the men who operated them, the drivers and the firemen,


740
0:47:48,96 --> 0:47:51,56
were retrained, but many found themselves


741
0:47:51,56 --> 0:47:57,52
redundant, skilled in a job that belonged in the last century.


742
0:47:57,52 --> 0:48:2,2
Most of the drivers actually went to Oxford to work,


743
0:48:2,2 --> 0:48:5,56
but I think nearly all the firemen left.


744
0:48:5,56 --> 0:48:7,64
Yeah, it was a sad day.


745
0:48:7,64 --> 0:48:13,24
It's... You know, nothing we could do about it.


746
0:48:13,24 --> 0:48:17,16
When it closed, I started working on building sites,


747
0:48:17,16 --> 0:48:21,72
you know, and erm...whatever jobs you could get, because


748
0:48:21,72 --> 0:48:26,36
you end up with what you thought you were, a skilled man


749
0:48:26,36 --> 0:48:31,6
when you was a fireman, you found you had no skills whatsoever.


750
0:48:31,6 --> 0:48:34,4
Steam needed to come to an end.


751
0:48:34,4 --> 0:48:38,16
I suppose the issue is, did it need to come to an end in 1968?


752
0:48:38,16 --> 0:48:40,44
The answer is probably no.


753
0:48:40,44 --> 0:48:44,4
There was a determined assault on steam locomotion


754
0:48:44,4 --> 0:48:45,76
in the Beeching period.


755
0:48:45,76 --> 0:48:50,2
Having been slower than many European countries


756
0:48:50,2 --> 0:48:55,4
to phase out steam, we suddenly embarked on a headlong rush


757
0:48:55,4 --> 0:48:58,72
to get rid of steam from 1963 to 1968.


758
0:48:58,72 --> 0:49:0,76
And I think that was unfortunate,


759
0:49:0,76 --> 0:49:4,6
because I think the diesel alternative wasn't always there.


760
0:49:4,6 --> 0:49:8,96
I mean, you've got to understand that when you go from steam


761
0:49:8,96 --> 0:49:11,84
to diesel, you've got to go overnight.


762
0:49:11,84 --> 0:49:15,32
You've got to stop all your coaling plants, you've got to stop all your


763
0:49:15,32 --> 0:49:18,64
water points, you've got to retrain all the drivers.


764
0:49:18,64 --> 0:49:20,48
It's crazy to run a double system.


765
0:49:20,48 --> 0:49:23,56
And Beeching's genius was he realised that.


766
0:49:23,56 --> 0:49:26,2
He'd got to retrain all his drivers at one go,


767
0:49:26,2 --> 0:49:29,52
you'd got to abandon steam, you couldn't let it dribble on.


768
0:49:29,52 --> 0:49:32,28
It did dribble on in various areas of the country.


769
0:49:32,28 --> 0:49:34,36
But essentially,


770
0:49:34,36 --> 0:49:37,6
the conversion of a railway from one form of locomotion to another


771
0:49:37,6 --> 0:49:40,0
has to be overnight, or you're doubling everything.


772
0:49:40,0 --> 0:49:43,36
And that's very, very expensive.


773
0:49:43,36 --> 0:49:46,2
On 11 August 1968, the fires were lit


774
0:49:46,2 --> 0:49:52,92
for the final passenger train to be pulled by steam on the main line.


775
0:49:52,92 --> 0:49:55,64
It was know as the 15 guineas special,


776
0:49:55,64 --> 0:49:59,56
because a ticket to ride that train cost 15 guineas.


777
0:49:59,56 --> 0:50:5,56
And it was a train that went from Liverpool to Manchester,


778
0:50:5,56 --> 0:50:12,28
then to Hellifield, and over the Settle-Carlisle line to Carlisle.


779
0:50:12,28 --> 0:50:15,28
And it was pulled by two types of engine, one type called the


780
0:50:15,28 --> 0:50:20,64
Black Five, which ended up being the major workhorse at the end of steam.


781
0:50:20,64 --> 0:50:24,12
And the last express passenger engine,


782
0:50:24,12 --> 0:50:39,2
which was a Pacific called Oliver Cromwell.


783
0:50:39,2 --> 0:50:41,48
But 1968 was not the end of steam.


784
0:50:41,48 --> 0:50:45,56
Though most engines lay rusting in scrap yards,


785
0:50:45,56 --> 0:50:47,88
a steam revival lay ahead.


786
0:50:47,88 --> 0:50:50,12
And the centre of that resurrection


787
0:50:50,12 --> 0:50:51,92
was a scrap yard in Barry in Wales,


788
0:50:51,92 --> 0:50:54,2
where many of the engines had been sent.


789
0:50:54,2 --> 0:50:59,4
All the way through the 1950s and '60s, when steam was being run down,


790
0:50:59,4 --> 0:51:2,92
the scrap yards of Britain were buzzing with gas axes, because,


791
0:51:2,92 --> 0:51:6,8
you know, they had a lot of engines to get through.


792
0:51:6,8 --> 0:51:8,96
And steam engines are made of very thick steel.


793
0:51:8,96 --> 0:51:12,36
Now, one of the scrap yards was called Barry Scrap Yard,


794
0:51:12,36 --> 0:51:15,92
it was owned by a guy called Dai Woodham, who got, I think,


795
0:51:15,92 --> 0:51:19,96
approaching 200 engines into his yard, but at the time,


796
0:51:19,96 --> 0:51:23,4
was cutting up wagons and coaches,


797
0:51:23,4 --> 0:51:26,4
had enough of those to be getting on with.


798
0:51:26,4 --> 0:51:28,12
The Government announced


799
0:51:28,12 --> 0:51:32,0
that there was to be a £250 million programme


800
0:51:32,0 --> 0:51:36,4
to modernise British Rail.


801
0:51:36,4 --> 0:51:40,84
And I thought, "Well, that's a gravy train! I'd better get on it!"


802
0:51:40,84 --> 0:51:43,4
And by the time the end of the '60s came along,


803
0:51:43,4 --> 0:51:45,96
preservation societies that had been set up


804
0:51:45,96 --> 0:51:49,16
after the end of steam were beginning to have enough money


805
0:51:49,16 --> 0:51:50,68
to buy individual engines.


806
0:51:50,68 --> 0:51:52,8
And Barry Scrap Yard was the last scrap yard


807
0:51:52,8 --> 0:51:55,2
where they were left in any number. So, suddenly,


808
0:51:55,2 --> 0:51:58,0
Dai was getting phone calls from preservation societies


809
0:51:58,0 --> 0:52:1,64
saying, "Can we buy that engine back from you, we want to restore it?"


810
0:52:1,64 --> 0:52:5,28
And, you know, obviously, Dai was gonna make a few quid out of that,


811
0:52:5,28 --> 0:52:7,4
probably a bit more than scrap value.


812
0:52:7,4 --> 0:52:8,52
So he went, "Yeah."


813
0:52:8,52 --> 0:52:11,6
And it saved him the trouble of having to cut them up.


814
0:52:11,6 --> 0:52:13,92
And over a 25-year period,


815
0:52:13,92 --> 0:52:20,4
every single engine in that yard was bought by a preservation society.


816
0:52:20,4 --> 0:52:24,28
Without Barry scrap yard, actually, the preservation industry wouldn't


817
0:52:24,28 --> 0:52:28,96
be that big, because there wouldn't be enough engines to run on it.


818
0:52:28,96 --> 0:52:31,4
I had my easel in Barry's scrap yard.


819
0:52:31,4 --> 0:52:34,8
That engine will probably be running now on a preserved railway.


820
0:52:34,8 --> 0:52:37,48
And look at the boiler cladding had burst open,


821
0:52:37,48 --> 0:52:40,12
and white asbestos, we were chucking it about.


822
0:52:40,12 --> 0:52:41,84
Terrifying to think


823
0:52:41,84 --> 0:52:43,52
what we were doing in those days.


824
0:52:43,52 --> 0:52:46,76
But what an end to a steam engine. But she was saved by someone.


825
0:52:46,76 --> 0:52:51,32
David Shepherd didn't just paint the steam engines that he loved.


826
0:52:51,32 --> 0:52:53,24
He bought several locomotives


827
0:52:53,24 --> 0:52:57,88
and began the long process of restoring them.


828
0:52:57,88 --> 0:53:0,4
And look at this thing here.


829
0:53:0,4 --> 0:53:2,52
It's rather pathetic when you think about it,


830
0:53:2,52 --> 0:53:4,44
cos these things live, don't they?


831
0:53:4,44 --> 0:53:6,56
Compared with a diesel, they have life.


832
0:53:6,56 --> 0:53:12,6
Something's got to be done, you know, we'll have to save some of these.


833
0:53:12,6 --> 0:53:14,4
And I went round to their office,


834
0:53:14,4 --> 0:53:16,68
their office was in the guard's van body,


835
0:53:16,68 --> 0:53:20,48
next to his Rolls-Royce, the whole thing was so funny, his Rolls-Royce,


836
0:53:20,48 --> 0:53:22,44
covered in oil, it was marvellous.


837
0:53:22,44 --> 0:53:25,8
I said, "I've come for some spares." He said, "OK, if you're fair,


838
0:53:25,8 --> 0:53:28,36
"and you treat us properly, take what you want."


839
0:53:28,36 --> 0:53:30,32
And we borrowed their oxyacetylene.


840
0:53:30,32 --> 0:53:33,4
But for £110, I think I got a whole set of coupling rods


841
0:53:33,4 --> 0:53:36,96
and a mechanical lubricator, which would cost thousands to build now.


842
0:53:36,96 --> 0:53:40,8
He said, "What have you got in the back of your estate car?"


843
0:53:40,8 --> 0:53:42,44
I said, "I've got a mechanical lubricator." "What's that?"


844
0:53:42,44 --> 0:53:44,96
He didn't know what it was. It was just hidden money to him.


845
0:53:44,96 --> 0:53:47,4
He gave it a push, and he said 12s 6d.


846
0:53:47,4 --> 0:53:50,0
So I gave him a quid and he gave us the change!


847
0:53:50,0 --> 0:53:52,28
I mean, those days were unreal.


848
0:53:52,28 --> 0:53:58,44
And this particular example, which is pretty rough,


849
0:53:58,44 --> 0:54:3,4
but I forecast that when the preservationists


850
0:54:3,4 --> 0:54:7,44
are finished with it, she'll be like the day she was built.


851
0:54:7,44 --> 0:54:11,56
Magic. Pure magic.


852
0:54:11,56 --> 0:54:13,72
I mean, steam hasn't come to an end,


853
0:54:13,72 --> 0:54:16,32
it was the beginning of the enthusiasts'


854
0:54:16,32 --> 0:54:20,48
railways, and really that is a tremendous story in its own right.


855
0:54:20,48 --> 0:54:25,92
It's a story that over the last 40 years has grown to include over 100


856
0:54:25,92 --> 0:54:32,92
separate heritage railways with 1,300 working steam locomotives.


857
0:54:32,92 --> 0:54:34,92
Six million visitors annually


858
0:54:34,92 --> 0:54:38,4
is proof that the public are still in love with steam.


859
0:54:38,4 --> 0:54:40,8
Have your tickets ready, please.


860
0:54:40,8 --> 0:54:43,68
Certainly, railway enthusiasm in Great Britain is...


861
0:54:43,68 --> 0:54:46,96
It's an industry now. It's huge.


862
0:54:46,96 --> 0:54:49,68
Literally millions of people travel on preserved lines


863
0:54:49,68 --> 0:54:51,76
or preserved steam trains every weekend.


864
0:54:51,76 --> 0:54:56,84
There are hundreds of thousands of people who are members of a society,


865
0:54:56,84 --> 0:54:59,4
or at least part of the wider circle


866
0:54:59,4 --> 0:55:4,72
of steam preservation societies in this country. It is huge.


867
0:55:4,72 --> 0:55:8,96
These are extraordinary enterprises, really,


868
0:55:8,96 --> 0:55:12,52
these are essentially amateurs, railway enthusiasts


869
0:55:12,52 --> 0:55:14,48
in the best sense of that word.


870
0:55:14,48 --> 0:55:18,16
People who are seeing part of British life disappearing,


871
0:55:18,16 --> 0:55:20,72
and who decide to do something about it.


872
0:55:20,72 --> 0:55:25,12
To preserve it in some shape or form, and to use their own time,


873
0:55:25,12 --> 0:55:30,56
their own money, their own energy to do precisely that. And they succeed.


874
0:55:30,56 --> 0:55:34,52
One the biggest success stories in railway preservation


875
0:55:34,52 --> 0:55:37,72
is the Great Western Society, based at Didcot,


876
0:55:37,72 --> 0:55:40,4
and started by the Southall boys.


877
0:55:40,4 --> 0:55:42,36
And money was still coming in!


878
0:55:42,36 --> 0:55:45,16
We'd bought the engine, we'd bought the coach,


879
0:55:45,16 --> 0:55:47,88
and then I suppose we started getting greedy!


880
0:55:47,88 --> 0:55:50,88
What else should we do? And in the end it began to...


881
0:55:50,88 --> 0:55:55,6
Not only engines and coaches, it was the artefacts, as you say.


882
0:55:55,6 --> 0:55:58,64
People began to collect and forward on to us


883
0:55:58,64 --> 0:56:1,68
or steer us in the direction of, you know...


884
0:56:1,68 --> 0:56:4,36
The Southall boys gradually assembled


885
0:56:4,36 --> 0:56:7,8
one of the finest railway collections in the world.


886
0:56:7,8 --> 0:56:13,4
24 steam locomotives stand alongside more than 80 wagons and coaches,


887
0:56:13,4 --> 0:56:17,28
and even signal boxes. The Great Western Society


888
0:56:17,28 --> 0:56:22,28
is now the second biggest tourist attraction in Oxfordshire.


889
0:56:22,28 --> 0:56:24,6
Different bell codes.


890
0:56:24,6 --> 0:56:26,0
Different means of operation.


891
0:56:26,0 --> 0:56:29,68
But then again you'd think that this box had been here for ever.


892
0:56:29,68 --> 0:56:32,0
The love of steam is no longer confined


893
0:56:32,0 --> 0:56:34,32
to looking back at the past.


894
0:56:34,32 --> 0:56:38,56
It's August 1st 2008 in Darlington.


895
0:56:38,56 --> 0:56:44,52
After 18 years, and funded by private donations to the tune of


896
0:56:44,52 --> 0:56:45,96
£3 million, the brand new


897
0:56:45,96 --> 0:56:58,64
A1 Class Tornado is finally ready to be launched.


898
0:56:58,64 --> 0:57:1,8
For me, it's the culmination of a lifetime's ambition.


899
0:57:1,8 --> 0:57:3,44
When I was at school and bored,


900
0:57:3,44 --> 0:57:6,76
I used to draw steam locomotives like this in my rough book.


901
0:57:6,76 --> 0:57:9,32
Subsequently, I've worked on restoring them,


902
0:57:9,32 --> 0:57:12,8
building models of them, and the chance to actually


903
0:57:12,8 --> 0:57:14,6
build a full size one, here in 2008,


904
0:57:14,6 --> 0:57:18,36
for me at the age of 57, I just find it unbelievable.


905
0:57:18,36 --> 0:57:20,4
It's really a great privilege


906
0:57:20,4 --> 0:57:23,36
and I'm very pleased to have had this chance, and to have had all the


907
0:57:23,36 --> 0:57:27,32
support that we've had to enable it to happen.


908
0:57:27,32 --> 0:57:29,8
It's the 40th anniversary of the end of steam.


909
0:57:29,8 --> 0:57:43,68
It's the 60th anniversary of the first A1 entering service.


910
0:57:43,68 --> 0:57:50,92
HORN BLOWS


911
0:57:50,92 --> 0:57:53,88
It's been 40 years since the last steam passenger train


912
0:57:53,88 --> 0:57:58,48
ran on a mainline in this country.


913
0:57:58,48 --> 0:58:10,96
With the launch of Tornado, steam has again found a new lease of life.


914
0:58:10,96 --> 0:58:14,12
It's good, it's working, it's doing what it's supposed to do.


915
0:58:14,12 --> 0:58:20,8
And hopefully she's putting on a good show for the crowd.


916
0:58:20,8 --> 0:58:23,68
I can feel the hairs on the back of my neck standing up at the moment,


917
0:58:23,68 --> 0:58:28,48
and the eyes are moistening.


918
0:58:28,48 --> 0:58:31,0
# There's an engine at the station


919
0:58:31,0 --> 0:58:33,52
# And the whistle blows my name


920
0:58:33,52 --> 0:58:35,96
# It's callin' callin' callin'


921
0:58:35,96 --> 0:58:38,48
# Come and get aboard the train


922
0:58:38,48 --> 0:58:43,24
# My baby's gone and I'm alone to live in misery


923
0:58:43,24 --> 0:58:48,24
# I'm gonna call and make a reservation for me


924
0:58:48,24 --> 0:58:50,32
# Gonna ride a blue train


925
0:58:50,32 --> 0:58:52,88
# Gonna ride a blue train. #
