###163 THOMAS MORTON: A month after Ze Claudio and his wife,
###165 Maria, were murdered, we flew to Brazil
###168 to meet their relatives.
###170 Our first stop was Maraba, a small city in
###172 the state of Para.
###174 
###177 We just landed in Maraba.
###178 It's right, kind of on the edge of the Amazon.
###181 It's known for it's cattle ranching, production of
###183 pig-iron from charcoal, and for being one of the most
###187 violent, lawless places in all of Brazil.
###190 Maraba is sometimes called Marabala, which means lot of
###193 bullets because it's kind of like the OK
###195 Corral, but in the jungle.
###199 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###208 THOMAS MORTON: We traveled to Maraba with Felipe Milanez, a
###211 Brazilian journalist who covers the Amazon.
###213 Until recently, Felipe was the editor of
###215 National Geographic Brazil.
###217 But he got fired after publicly criticizing another
###219 magazine owned by the same company who printed a bogus
###222 article about Indians.
###225 Felipe met Ze Claudio and Maria a few months before
###227 their death and shot an interview with them outside
###229 their house.
###230 They became friends and Felipe has continued to cover their
###232 story for different outlets.
###234 
###238 We're heading across the river to visit Ze Claudio's sister.
###242 They're scared that they're next on the list--
###245 you know, people to be killed.

###338 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###342 THOMAS MORTON: Claudelice grew up in the same farm settlement
###344 where Ze Claudio and Maria lived, a couple
###346 hours north of Maraba.
###348 Since the murder, she's decided to move to a
###350 relative's house in the city where she feels safer.
###354 CLAUDELICE DOS SANTOS: [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###356 THOMAS MORTON: We wanted to see the settlement where Ze
###358 Claudio and Maria lived.
###359 Maria's sister, Laisa, lived there too, but she has also
###362 moved to Maraba because of the safety situation.
###365 However, she had to go to her house to pick up some of her
###367 belongings.
###368 So we drove up there to meet her.
###370 
###373 We're on our way to the settlement where Ze Claudio
###375 and Maria lived and worked.
###379 This is the road actually that they were killed on.
###382 And it's a kind of scary road if you think about it in terms
###386 of ambushes.
###389 You have to slow to basically a stop every couple of minutes
###393 to cross bridges or to get cows out of your way.
###397 It's a little creepy feeling.
###399 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###406 LAISA SAMPAIO: [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###407 
###441 THOMAS MORTON: Did you or anybody in your family, were
###444 you guys worried for Maria and Ze Claudio's safety?
###448 LAISA SAMPAIO: [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###450 
###487 THOMAS MORTON: This is Ze Claudio's house?
###488 FELIPE MILANEZ: Yeah.
###490 [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###491 
###513 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###519 THOMAS MORTON: This is Ze Claudio and Maria's house.
###522 As you can see, it hasn't been touched
###524 since they were killed.
###525 It's frozen like it was when they went out.
###528 There's still clothing on the line.
###530 There's still food in the kitchen.
###532 There's still nuts rotting now in the nut area.
###537 The family, I think, for the most part is
###539 scared to come up here.
###541 So it is sad and spooky.
###544 
###546 In the back of the house, Ze Claudio had a little nut
###549 workshop, tabletop nutcrackers, a little
###552 greenhouse with a rack to dry the nuts on, a small press,
###556 and an oven which they would use to make oil and cream and
###559 other products.
###561 This was the base of their livelihood.
###563 Ze Claudio wasn't a political guy or some professional
###565 activist, he was just a small time nut forager
###568 living off the land.

###673 JOSE BATISTA: [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###674 
###694 THOMAS MORTON: Jose Batista is a lawyer who works at the
###696 Pastoral Land Commission in Maraba.
###698 For the last 15 years, he's provide legal aid to poor
###700 workers in area as well as people associated with the
###702 various social movements.
###705 He was also a friend and legal adviser to Ze Claudio and
###707 Maria before they were killed.
###710 JOSE BATISTA: [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###712 
###736 THOMAS MORTON: Can you explain kind of why there's so much
###740 violence in this region?
###742 JOSE BATISTA: [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###743 
###764 CLAUDELICE DOS SANTOS: [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###765 
###803 THOMAS MORTON: While we've come to think of the
###803 rainforest as primarily an environmental issue, the heart
###806 of the violence in the Amazon is land reform.
###809 The real conflict here isn't so much between man and nature
###812 as it is between rich and poor.
###815 Since Brazil became a democracy in 1985, more than
###818 1,700 land activists and community
###820 leaders have been killed.
###823 One of the most violent episodes in the struggle for
###825 land happened in 1996 just south of Maraba.
###830 JOSE BATISTA: [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###831 
###853 THOMAS MORTON: On that day, thousands of peasants and
###855 small farmers were marching for land rights and for the
###858 right to occupy a large local ranch which was being kept
###861 intentionally unproductive by its rich owner.
###864 This is Raimundo Gouvea, who was here when
###867 the massacre happened.
###868 He survived it.
###870 Raimundo, can you tell me what was happening before the
###873 massacre took place?

###898 
###913 JOSE BATISTA: [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###914 
###925 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###929 THOMAS MORTON: The march that ended in the massacre was
###931 organized by the Landless Workers Movement, or MST, one
###934 of the largest social movements in Brazil.
###938 Joao Pedro Stedile is one of MST's founding members.
###942 JOAO PEDRO STEDILE: [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###943 
###975 THOMAS MORTON: We're at an MST encampment.
###977 All this land is owned by some rich guy who basically doesn't
###980 take care of the land.
###981 It's all overgrown.
###982 And so what the Landless Movement does is they take
###984 farmers who don't have any land and they move in and set
###988 up a little village like this that they have to guard.
###990 And it's basically, like, there's no such thing as
###992 squatters rights in Brazil.
###993 It's not in the law.
###993 But that's the principal they're using.
###995 And eventually they'll hope to turn it into a legitimate
###998 settlement.
###998 And all these people will be able to use the land legally.
###1002 JOAO PEDRO STEDILE: [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###1003 
###1046 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###1049 THOMAS MORTON: This massive inequality in land ownership
###1050 has been the central bugaboo of Brazilian politics.
###1053 The last president to openly call for land reform in 1964
###1057 was overthrown by a military coup two weeks later.
###1060 And Brazil spent the next 20 years in a brutal, repressive
###1063 dictatorship.
###1065 JOAO PEDRO STEDILE: [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###1066 
###1076 THOMAS MORTON: At the same time, the juntas set out to
###1077 boost Brazil's economy by conquering the Amazon, which
###1080 brought the land conflict into the rainforest.
###1083 They created a program like the American Homesteading Act
###1085 where settlers were given big chunks of land provided they
###1088 clear cut at least 50% of it.
###1090 The government also built the Transamazonica, a highway
###1093 coming straight through the heart of the rainforest
###1095 opening it up for loggers and developers.
###1098 JOSE BATISTA: [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###1099 
###1131 THOMAS MORTON: The dictatorship ended in 1984.
###1133 As Brazil transitioned into democracy, social movements
###1136 like MST pushed for a long overdue land reform.
###1138 They were thwarted, however, by a powerful political block
###1141 of cattle ranchers, land owners, and loggers known as
###1144 the "ruralistas."
###1148 [SINGING IN PORTUGUESE]
###1151 THOMAS MORTON: As MST led the struggle for land reform in
###1153 the '80s, the fight to protect the rainforest also gained
###1156 movement under the leadership of Chico Mendes.
###1160 Chico was a rubber tapper from the state of Acre who became a
###1163 union leader and from there was thrust into
###1164 environmental activism.
###1167 He fought for the creation of extractive reserves, which are
###1169 sections of rainforest like Ze Claudio and Maria's
###1171 settlement, that are set aside from development exclusively
###1174 for the use of people who make their living off the forest.
###1179 After rising to international attention, Chico
###1181 called his own death.
###1182 He told attendees at his 40th birthday,
###1184 I'll be dead by Christmas.
###1186 And he was.
###1188 Killed by gunmen at his house on December 22, 1988.
###1192 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###1193 
###1203 THOMAS MORTON: Six months before Ze Claudio was killed,
###1205 he was invited to Manaus to give a TED
###1206 talk about the Amazon.
###1209 There in front of the audience, just like Chico, he
###1212 predicted his own death.
###1214 ZE CLAUDIO: [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###1216 
###1239 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###1253 THOMAS MORTON: When we think of the rainforest in America,
###1254 it's kind of a very effete, environmentalist,
###1259 hippy sort of cause.
###1259 But down here, it sums up everything that's been going
###1262 on with Brazil for a while.
###1263 It's about issues of land ownership.
###1266 It's also about the environment and the impact
###1268 it'll have.
###1270 And it's about the economy.
###1272 Right now we're in Belem.
###1273 It's the capital of Para, which is the state
###1275 that Maraba is in.
###1276 It's sort of at the mouth of the Amazon.
###1279 We're going to go to the offices of Imazon.
###1281 They're a private research group who tracks the effects
###1284 of deforestation.
###1285 So hopefully we'll get kind of a general overview so we don't
###1288 have to rely on Sting lyrics for all
###1290 our rainforest knowledge.
###1293 PAULO BARRETO: So this is the map of the Amazon.
###1295 It shows deforestation in red.
###1299 This is called the "arc of deforestation." This is where
###1302 most of the forestation is.
###1303 Nowadays, about 17% is the forest.
###1307 THOMAS MORTON: So it's at 17% deforestation
###1310 basically right now.
###1311 How quickly has that happened?
###1312 Has that been since the 1900s?
###1313 Or has most of it been in the last 20 or 30 years?
###1318 PAULO BARRETO: Yeah.
###1318 In the last 30 years.
###1319 THOMAS MORTON: How much can the forest take?
###1321 There's got to be a level at which you
###1323 basically kill it, right?
###1324 At which the forest starts to collapse?
###1326 When does that happen?
###1327 PAULO BARRETO: If you have more than 30% deforestation,
###1331 then you have a huge risk of larger areas of the Amazon
###1336 becoming more like a savanna-type vegetation.
###1339 THOMAS MORTON: At the current rate, how
###1341 soon will we hit 30%?
###1344 PAULO BARRETO: 30 years.
###1345 THOMAS MORTON: 30 years.
###1347 PAULO BARRETO: Less than 30 years.
###1347 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###1350 THOMAS MORTON: To see what the Brazilian government is doing
###1352 to slow down deforestation, we tagged along with a law
###1355 enforcement operation back in Maraba.
###1358 Good morning.
###1360 It's a little after 6:00.
###1362 We're just loading some picnic snacks in a cooler into the
###1365 back of our truck.
###1366 And we're supposed to go out into the rainforest today to
###1368 do a raid on a illegal logging operation with IBAMA, which
###1373 it's just like the Brazilian version of the Environmental
###1375 Protection Agency.
###1376 Except instead of looking like the red-haired nerd from
###1380 Ghostbusters, they all look like the cast of Predator.
###1384 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###1390 FELIPE MILANEZ: [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###1391 
###1407 THOMAS MORTON: IBAMA helicopters flew ahead of the
###1409 convoy and spotted the saw mills through the trees.
###1411 From the air, they saw three men trying to get
###1413 away on dirt bikes.
###1414 Two managed to escape, but federal police caught the
###1416 third one and made him lead us back into the forest to show
###1419 us the sites where he'd been harvesting trees.
###1422 We just crossed from basically a cow pasture into straight
###1425 on, full on jungle.
###1427 
###1432 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###1433 
###1446 EVERALDO EGUCHI: [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###1447 
###1466 THOMAS MORTON: [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###1468 These are illegal to cut down, right?
###1470 EVERALDO EGUCHI: [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###1471 
###1502 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###1508 THOMAS MORTON: We just pulled over to the guy who was
###1510 arrested's house and it's really grim.
###1514 Now his wife's sobbing.
###1516 You know, they've got to feel bad.
###1519 People who do the illegal deforestation aren't
###1521 necessarily the people who are really profiting
###1523 from it that much.
###1524 These are often cases, like, poor, desperate log workers or
###1528 farmers and stuff out of business.
###1529 
###1534 After all the good lumber has been sold, the loggers use
###1536 what's left over to make charcoal.
###1539 We went with IBAMA in a helicopter to see some of the
###1541 illegal charcoal evidence near Maraba.
###1545 It's actually nuts how many there were.
###1546 It's like hundreds of little Jawa huts belching out smoke
###1549 everywhere you looked.
###1550 
###1553 MARCO VIDAL: [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###1555 
###1590 THOMAS MORTON: The charcoal produced in these ovens is
###1592 then shipped to the many pig-iron
###1593 plants surrounding Maraba.
###1594 
###1597 And you see that's a charcoal truck.
###1599 You see them all over the streets in Maraba.
###1603 This is COSIPAR.
###1604 It's one of the companies in Maraba that makes pig-iron,
###1608 which is a component in steel.
###1610 And it's actually, like, Amazonian pig-iron is used in
###1613 a lot of US steel and US products that involve steel,
###1616 like the car industry.
###1618 A lot of the charcoal used by the pig-iron plants isn't just
###1621 from illegal wood.
###1623 It's also made by slave labor.
###1625 Actually, slavery is a really big problem in all of Brazil.
###1628 Cattle farms, illegal sawmills, even
###1630 factories use slaves.
###1632 Nobody is bought and sold outright.
###1633 But what happens is poor workers get recruited for jobs
###1636 far away from home, then charged their entire wages
###1639 just for food and lodging.
###1640 So essentially, they're stuck working for free and often in
###1643 concentration camp-like conditions.
###1646 Batista took us to a shelter for escaped slaves.
###1649 There we met a guy who had just gotten away from a shady
###1651 cattle operation.

###1676 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING PORTUGUESE]
###1677 
###1681 THOMAS MORTON: All these different abuses from the
###1682 landowners, the loggers, the charcoal producers, and the
###1686 farmers were what Ze Claudio and Maria were fighting to
###1688 stop, particularly in the area where they lived.
###1694 Nova Ipixuna is the nearest town to Ze Claudio and Maria's
###1696 settlement.
###1697 It's economy is almost completely
###1699 reliant on illegal logging.
###1702 Unsurprisingly, Ze Claudio and Maria had a
###1703 lot of enemies here.
###1706 About a month after their deaths, IBAMA launched a
###1708 massive series of raids shutting down all the illegal
###1710 sawmills in the area.
