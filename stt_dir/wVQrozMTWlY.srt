1
0:3:58,48 --> 0:4:0,16
The New South Wales government


2
0:4:0,16 --> 0:4:2,92
has unveiled a radical solution
to the water crisis.


3
0:4:2,92 --> 0:4:7,12
It plans to tap into an abandoned
reservoir under the city.


4
0:4:7,12 --> 0:4:9,64
$95 million will be spent


5
0:4:9,64 --> 0:4:14,16
on a state-of-the-art water recycling
facility in the heart of Sydney.


6
0:4:14,16 --> 0:4:16,0
My name is Natasha Warner


7
0:4:16,0 --> 0:4:19,96
and I've worked in news and
current affairs for well over 10 years.


8
0:4:19,96 --> 0:4:22,28
I knew that I wanted to tell stories.


9
0:4:22,28 --> 0:4:24,84
I knew I wanted to
communicate to the public


10
0:4:24,84 --> 0:4:28,56
and, um, that looked like
the perfect place for me.


11
0:4:28,56 --> 0:4:31,84
The NSW Minister
for Water and the Environment


12
0:4:31,84 --> 0:4:35,44
has been under sustained fire
for 12 months now.


13
0:4:35,44 --> 0:4:38,8
Sydney's water reserves
are at an all-time low.


14
0:4:38,8 --> 0:4:42,0
We are a progressive government
and in the face of climate change


15
0:4:42,0 --> 0:4:45,4
we need to look at all possibilities,
and recycling water


16
0:4:45,4 --> 0:4:46,88
is definitely the way of the future.


17
0:4:46,88 --> 0:4:50,2
I first came across a story which was
focusing on the government


18
0:4:50,2 --> 0:4:52,56
that had just announced
some water recycling plans


19
0:4:52,56 --> 0:4:55,6
and they wanted to use
abandoned underground tunnels


20
0:4:55,6 --> 0:4:59,8
in one of our biggest rail systems.


21
0:4:59,8 --> 0:5:2,56
Thousands of people
pass through here each day


22
0:5:2,56 --> 0:5:6,2
not realising the state government's
solution to the water crisis


23
0:5:6,2 --> 0:5:7,84
is beneath their feet.


24
0:5:7,84 --> 0:5:10,6
The plan is to build
recycling infrastructure


25
0:5:10,6 --> 0:5:16,12
to make use of millions of litres of water
trapped in disused train tunnels.


26
0:5:16,12 --> 0:5:17,84
I didn't realise how vast they were.


27
0:5:17,84 --> 0:5:22,28
There's virtually a whole other city
underneath us.


28
0:5:22,28 --> 0:5:25,6
Welfare groups say the tunnels
are a refuge for Sydney's homeless.


29
0:5:25,6 --> 0:5:27,88
Building underground
water recycling infrastructure


30
0:5:27,88 --> 0:5:32,4
would leave them with nowhere to go.


31
0:5:32,4 --> 0:5:35,36
The new homeless concerns
are likely to cause another road block


32
0:5:35,36 --> 0:5:38,52
for the government's
water crisis solution.


33
0:5:38,52 --> 0:5:40,4
In a similar scenario in the US,


34
0:5:40,4 --> 0:5:41,96
hundreds of homeless


35
0:5:41,96 --> 0:5:44,2
were recently
evicted from underground tunnels.


36
0:5:44,2 --> 0:5:46,68
It caused a public relations nightmare.


37
0:5:46,68 --> 0:5:48,8
You can quickly
see why the government's


38
0:5:48,8 --> 0:5:50,76
having so much
trouble evicting the homeless.


39
0:5:50,76 --> 0:5:53,32
I mean, trying to navigate through


40
0:5:53,32 --> 0:5:56,32
this maze of dark tunnels is hard.


41
0:5:56,32 --> 0:5:58,4
Trying to find people hiding in here


42
0:5:58,4 --> 0:5:59,84
is virtually impossible.


43
0:5:59,84 --> 0:6:1,8
The Water and Environment minister
says


44
0:6:1,8 --> 0:6:5,96
there is no evidence
of anyone living in Sydney's tunnels.


45
0:6:5,96 --> 0:6:11,12
He says if Labor wins the election,
the water solution will proceed.


46
0:6:11,12 --> 0:6:15,0
After the initial fanfare
the story dried up --


47
0:6:15,0 --> 0:6:17,84
it was like the whole thing
never happened.


48
0:6:17,84 --> 0:6:22,36
That's when alarm bells went off in
my head. Things just don't disappear.


49
0:6:22,36 --> 0:6:25,88
Whenever something's not
spoken about, I've got to ask why.


50
0:6:25,88 --> 0:6:37,52
It's my job as a journalist.


51
0:6:37,52 --> 0:6:39,36
Cheers, John. Happy birthday.


52
0:6:39,36 --> 0:6:41,24
My birthday...


53
0:6:41,24 --> 0:6:43,52
What's your birthday message?


54
0:6:43,52 --> 0:6:48,24
What do you have to say?
Uh, John...


55
0:6:48,24 --> 0:6:51,0
Actually, I can tell you
a story about John.


56
0:6:51,0 --> 0:6:53,96
You guys may not know this one,
it was way back in 1991.


57
0:6:53,96 --> 0:6:57,36
My name's Steve Miller,
I'm a TV cameraman.


58
0:6:57,36 --> 0:7:1,2
I've been working in news
and current affairs since the mid-'80s.


59
0:7:1,2 --> 0:7:4,4
Me and Pete had just started,
and they sent us to the first Gulf War.


60
0:7:4,4 --> 0:7:6,24
So we had to phone home to the office,


61
0:7:6,24 --> 0:7:8,24
to John, who was
the news director at the time,


62
0:7:8,24 --> 0:7:9,8
and said, "Send us more cash.


63
0:7:9,8 --> 0:7:13,4
"We need to get some gas masks
and chemical suits and stuff."


64
0:7:13,4 --> 0:7:15,44
So they sent us, like, 10 grand.


65
0:7:15,44 --> 0:7:19,28
We've got this cash in our hand, we've
gone, "Fuck it, let's spend it on piss!"


66
0:7:19,28 --> 0:7:22,72
And the air raid sirens, everyone else
is fucking pulling on their masks,


67
0:7:22,72 --> 0:7:27,2
and we're just going, "Oh, fuck it."


68
0:7:27,2 --> 0:7:30,36
You kind of get married to the job,
so the people you work with,


69
0:7:30,36 --> 0:7:33,12
they end up becoming
like family members.


70
0:7:33,12 --> 0:7:34,6
You've met our soundo.


71
0:7:34,6 --> 0:7:38,84
He's an incredibly handsome young
man, but he's not very good at his job.


72
0:7:38,84 --> 0:7:41,16
Come here, Tangles.
What're you talking about?


73
0:7:41,16 --> 0:7:43,88
I'm talking about the time
in the States we went...


74
0:7:43,88 --> 0:7:45,64
Two weeks you went
without headphones.


75
0:7:45,64 --> 0:7:47,12
Remember that?


76
0:7:47,12 --> 0:7:49,4
And did anyone notice?
No-one noticed!


77
0:7:49,4 --> 0:7:51,56
He's a genius.
That's how good I am.


78
0:7:51,56 --> 0:7:56,68
I don't even need to hear it,
I feel it on the knobs.


79
0:7:56,68 --> 0:7:58,48
When you get that gang on the road,


80
0:7:58,48 --> 0:8:0,72
when you get Steve
and Tangles out on a shoot,


81
0:8:0,72 --> 0:8:2,48
they're just...


82
0:8:2,48 --> 0:8:5,0
They're professional,
but they're also kids.


83
0:8:5,0 --> 0:8:11,28
At the end of the day they like to
muck around and have a bit of a laugh.


84
0:8:11,28 --> 0:8:16,16
I remember Natasha,
she was at another network


85
0:8:16,16 --> 0:8:20,2
and then a couple of years later
they brought her across to us.


86
0:8:20,2 --> 0:8:22,76
First impression?


87
0:8:22,76 --> 0:8:25,88
Just another young person coming in


88
0:8:25,88 --> 0:8:28,96
getting paid too much money,
hadn't really proved herself.


89
0:8:28,96 --> 0:8:31,16
But, you know,
she was the next big thing.


90
0:8:31,16 --> 0:8:32,84
Hey, Pete! Pete!


91
0:8:32,84 --> 0:8:34,32
A business meeting?


92
0:8:34,32 --> 0:8:37,12
Production meeting.
Production meeting.


93
0:8:37,12 --> 0:8:38,88
Talking about producing some, uh...


94
0:8:38,88 --> 0:8:43,12
..sea-man.


95
0:8:43,12 --> 0:8:46,16
Well, yeah... produ...


96
0:8:46,16 --> 0:8:57,28
How's that? You'd better
turn that off soon.


97
0:8:57,28 --> 0:8:58,56
Pete!
Pete!


98
0:8:58,56 --> 0:9:0,44
Hey?
The one that got away!


99
0:9:0,44 --> 0:9:2,68
I'm not away, I'm here.
Haven't we done that story before?


100
0:9:2,68 --> 0:9:4,84
Come in here, mate.


101
0:9:4,84 --> 0:9:8,56
Pete and I, we had
an interesting working relationship.


102
0:9:8,56 --> 0:9:13,8
He was very determined
in the way he would do his job


103
0:9:13,8 --> 0:9:15,6
and I was very determined in the way
I would do mine.


104
0:9:15,6 --> 0:9:17,76
Sometimes that would
work well together,


105
0:9:17,76 --> 0:9:21,32
and sometimes it would
sort of cause a bit of friction.


106
0:9:21,32 --> 0:9:25,68
Whenever her name came up,
the subject was changed pretty quickly.


107
0:9:25,68 --> 0:9:27,92
When you think back on it now,
you sort of go,


108
0:9:27,92 --> 0:9:42,52
"Oh, yeah, there was
something going on there."


109
0:9:42,52 --> 0:9:46,24
I came across a YouTube video
which showed some youths


110
0:9:46,24 --> 0:9:49,52
defacing and vandalising
areas around the tunnels.


111
0:9:49,52 --> 0:9:53,6
Sef? Did you do this?


112
0:9:53,6 --> 0:9:55,88
You are fucking kidding me!


113
0:9:55,88 --> 0:9:57,52
Fucking teach them a lesson, then, eh?


114
0:9:57,52 --> 0:9:59,0
I fucking will.


115
0:9:59,0 --> 0:10:1,6
This is what I think of your shit, MK.


116
0:10:1,6 --> 0:10:4,48
Within that clip itself


117
0:10:4,48 --> 0:10:6,64
there was something unknown.


118
0:10:6,64 --> 0:10:11,52
Quite clearly, though, there was
something there in the tunnel.


119
0:10:11,52 --> 0:10:13,0
Fuck was that?


120
0:10:13,0 --> 0:10:14,92
Shh... Shh...


121
0:10:14,92 --> 0:10:19,8
What was that?
Shut up.


122
0:10:19,8 --> 0:10:21,72
Fuck, what the fuck was that?


123
0:10:21,72 --> 0:10:26,36
They're still here.


124
0:10:26,36 --> 0:10:27,48
Oi!


125
0:10:27,48 --> 0:10:29,88
Give me the torch...
Sef, come on, let's get out of here.


126
0:10:29,88 --> 0:10:31,48
Just fucking give me
the torch, you bitch!


127
0:10:31,48 --> 0:10:34,64
No, don't! Come on!
It's cool, it's fucking cool. Oi!


128
0:10:34,64 --> 0:10:37,16
Think you can tag
on my fuckin' work, do ya?


129
0:10:37,16 --> 0:10:38,64
Fuck, Sef, come on.
We've gotta fucking...


130
0:10:38,64 --> 0:10:40,12
Fuck.


131
0:10:40,12 --> 0:10:46,96
Sef!
Sef?


132
0:10:46,96 --> 0:10:50,24
Sef? What the hell, Sef? Come on!


133
0:10:50,24 --> 0:10:52,8
Hold on. Sef, ANSWER ME!


134
0:10:52,8 --> 0:10:55,68
Sef!
Fuck this. I'm out of here.


135
0:10:55,68 --> 0:10:57,6
Dez, hold on. Don't go anywhere. Wait.


136
0:10:57,6 --> 0:11:0,4
J, come on!
Dez, stop!


137
0:11:0,4 --> 0:11:3,4
Dez, don't rack off!
What the fuck are you doing? Help!


138
0:11:3,4 --> 0:11:12,72
Sef? Sef, answer me, please!


139
0:11:12,72 --> 0:11:17,72
Once I saw that clip, I thought,
"This is a story I can go to John with."


140
0:11:17,72 --> 0:11:20,36
You know,
"Finally it's got some strength."


141
0:11:20,36 --> 0:11:25,4
Since when does a decent journalist
use YouTube as research?


142
0:11:25,4 --> 0:11:28,88
It was a good clip, but at the time
I thought, "She's crazy."


143
0:11:28,88 --> 0:11:33,12
When I pitched the story to John,
he put Pete on this.


144
0:11:33,12 --> 0:11:35,36
What that meant was...


145
0:11:35,36 --> 0:11:37,84
Pete had an upcoming job
and story in China


146
0:11:37,84 --> 0:11:40,84
which he was very,
very passionate about.


147
0:11:40,84 --> 0:11:52,84
And I had to give him the news
that he was taken off the story.


148
0:11:52,84 --> 0:11:56,76
I first heard about the tunnels
being a potential story for us


149
0:11:56,76 --> 0:12:0,56
just as we were prepping up
actually to go to China, with Pete.


150
0:12:0,56 --> 0:12:3,0
Hey, mate, there's
a focus chart there somewhere.


151
0:12:3,0 --> 0:12:5,4
Can you just hold it up for us?
Yeah, yeah. No worries.


152
0:12:5,4 --> 0:12:6,88
Beauty.


153
0:12:6,88 --> 0:12:8,92
He'd been working
on this thing for a long time


154
0:12:8,92 --> 0:12:12,56
and he was pretty pumped
to get over there and get stuck into it.


155
0:12:12,56 --> 0:12:14,64
I think he had some pretty good leads,


156
0:12:14,64 --> 0:12:18,56
which could have blown
his career wide open -- it was great.


157
0:12:18,56 --> 0:12:20,76
How's it look, mate?
Mate, it looks pretty good.


158
0:12:20,76 --> 0:12:22,68
It ought to, the amount the repairs cost.


159
0:12:22,68 --> 0:12:25,12
Thanks, Tangles. Nice one.


160
0:12:25,12 --> 0:12:26,96
No more throwing cameras
around stairwells.


161
0:12:26,96 --> 0:12:30,8
Yeah, I told you guys
it's not my fault, alright?


162
0:12:30,8 --> 0:12:34,64
Hey, um, you happy to go handheld?
The lighter we go, the quicker we move.


163
0:12:34,64 --> 0:12:37,24
Absolutely, mate.
We 're going to China after all.


164
0:12:37,24 --> 0:12:41,52
More room for cheap DVDs,
pirated software...


165
0:12:41,52 --> 0:12:43,0
You're all class, mate.


166
0:12:43,0 --> 0:12:46,28
It was purely John's decision
to put Pete on this story.


167
0:12:46,28 --> 0:12:50,28
Well, I was a little uncomfortable
with having Pete there to start with.


168
0:12:50,28 --> 0:12:59,36
Like I said before,
we weren't exactly always gelling.


169
0:12:59,36 --> 0:13:1,28
I was really nervous
about talking to Pete.


170
0:13:1,28 --> 0:13:20,8
I didn't wanna tell him.


171
0:13:20,8 --> 0:13:21,68
It's not that exciting,


172
0:13:21,68 --> 0:13:25,24
when you're building your hopes up
for this great big story


173
0:13:25,24 --> 0:13:30,88
and then you sort of
get given a shit sandwich.


174
0:13:30,88 --> 0:13:33,48
I thought at that point
I was doing the right thing.


175
0:13:33,48 --> 0:13:36,84
I thought that Pete having to postpone
what he had planned


176
0:13:36,84 --> 0:13:43,84
was worth it in the end for the story.


177
0:13:43,84 --> 0:13:46,96
He did say he went in to see John.


178
0:13:46,96 --> 0:13:49,44
I don't know
what happened in that room,


179
0:13:49,44 --> 0:13:52,0
and the contents of that conversation


180
0:13:52,0 --> 0:13:54,96
but, yeah, he had spoken
to John about it,


181
0:13:54,96 --> 0:13:57,96
and I think it was from that point on


182
0:13:57,96 --> 0:14:14,6
it was clear he wasn't going to China
and Nat had won the day.


183
0:14:14,6 --> 0:14:19,28
Why did John go the other way?


184
0:14:19,28 --> 0:14:22,48
C'mon. We all know
why John was favouring Nat.


185
0:14:22,48 --> 0:14:31,36
Eh?


186
0:14:31,36 --> 0:14:34,68
Once Peter was on the story
we started attending the daily pressers


187
0:14:34,68 --> 0:14:38,6
to try and find out what happened
to the water recycling plans.


188
0:14:38,6 --> 0:14:41,8
Pete was pissed off,
but, you know, Pete's a pro.


189
0:14:41,8 --> 0:14:43,8
Took him a day or two,
then he came round


190
0:14:43,8 --> 0:14:45,44
just like the guy he is.


191
0:14:45,44 --> 0:14:49,24
He started to do
his own searching around --


192
0:14:49,24 --> 0:14:51,6
he had contacts in the council
who he spoke to.


193
0:14:51,6 --> 0:14:53,56
And some rumours started to surface


194
0:14:53,56 --> 0:14:56,12
that not only were there
homeless living in the tunnels,


195
0:14:56,12 --> 0:14:58,32
but there were homeless
that were going missing.


196
0:14:58,32 --> 0:15:1,8
You know, at that point
we slowly started to think


197
0:15:1,8 --> 0:15:2,76
there may be something in this.


198
0:15:2,76 --> 0:15:4,76
So we just started


199
0:15:4,76 --> 0:15:8,28
by chasing the then water minister.


200
0:15:8,28 --> 0:15:10,28
The main thing that was apparent --


201
0:15:10,28 --> 0:15:14,4
that he was staying quiet on the topic.


202
0:15:14,4 --> 0:15:16,64
He wouldn't talk to us --
no-one would talk to us.


203
0:15:16,64 --> 0:15:18,88
At that point, we were
just getting stonewalled.


204
0:15:18,88 --> 0:15:21,36
If it was true
that homeless were going missing,


205
0:15:21,36 --> 0:15:23,52
this was a big story.


206
0:15:23,52 --> 0:15:27,92
And it was a really important one.


207
0:15:27,92 --> 0:15:29,92
Where is he?
Through here.


208
0:15:29,92 --> 0:15:31,4
Minister!


209
0:15:31,4 --> 0:15:34,48
Minister, have you seen the report about
the homeless people in the tunnels?


210
0:15:34,48 --> 0:15:36,28
Nothing to say at the moment.


211
0:15:36,28 --> 0:15:38,92
Have you scrapped your plans because
people are going missing in the tunnels?


212
0:15:38,92 --> 0:15:41,0
No comment. No comment.


213
0:15:41,0 --> 0:15:42,72
Minister, should people be worried?


214
0:15:42,72 --> 0:15:52,28
Is there a threat in
the underground tunnels?


215
0:15:52,28 --> 0:15:53,84
Well?


216
0:15:53,84 --> 0:15:57,36
Alright... that was alright.
You reckon?


217
0:15:57,36 --> 0:15:59,16
I knew we wouldn't get anything.


218
0:15:59,16 --> 0:16:3,24
I think that definitely
on quite a large scale


219
0:16:3,24 --> 0:16:5,8
there was a lot of people
in the government


220
0:16:5,8 --> 0:16:6,56
that knew what was going on.


221
0:16:6,56 --> 0:16:8,52
They knew what was
going on down there.


222
0:16:8,52 --> 0:16:11,44
You know, with everything
that's happened subsequently,


223
0:16:11,44 --> 0:16:22,88
they were hiding stuff.


224
0:16:22,88 --> 0:16:26,88
I started getting in contact with
a few of the shelters around the city,


225
0:16:26,88 --> 0:16:30,4
and eventually I came across
one particular homeless man


226
0:16:30,4 --> 0:16:34,4
who I had believed
had been living in the tunnels.


227
0:16:34,4 --> 0:16:37,8
So this was...
I mean, this was fantastic.


228
0:16:37,8 --> 0:16:42,96
We had, finally, someone to speak to.


229
0:16:42,96 --> 0:16:49,36
Right, Trevor, just one sec.
I've gotta fix your mike, if that's OK.


230
0:16:49,36 --> 0:16:54,88
I'm not sure how she found Trevor,
but Natasha found Trevor.


231
0:16:54,88 --> 0:17:1,88
We went down to this home,
and we sat him down for an interview.


232
0:17:1,88 --> 0:17:3,44
Yeah, sweet.


233
0:17:3,44 --> 0:17:7,56
Alright, mate. This will be fun.
You'll be on telly.


234
0:17:7,56 --> 0:17:9,32
Alright, guys, I'm sweet.


235
0:17:9,32 --> 0:17:11,48
Trevor, if you don't feel
comfortable with anything


236
0:17:11,48 --> 0:17:13,56
you let me know at any time.


237
0:17:13,56 --> 0:17:16,88
And, um, when I'm
asking you the questions,


238
0:17:16,88 --> 0:17:20,6
if you're not quite sure
of an answer, that's OK --


239
0:17:20,6 --> 0:17:22,88
we can fix it up later,
so don't worry about that.


240
0:17:22,88 --> 0:17:25,12
Good.
Yeah? Thank you.


241
0:17:25,12 --> 0:17:29,28
Well, the interview with Trevor
was a tricky one


242
0:17:29,28 --> 0:17:32,16
but something that I am, I guess,


243
0:17:32,16 --> 0:17:34,6
always quite accustomed
to dealing with.


244
0:17:34,6 --> 0:17:37,44
Trevor, I understand you've
been living it rough...


245
0:17:37,44 --> 0:17:39,92
Call me Trev.


246
0:17:39,92 --> 0:17:42,92
Trev? OK.


247
0:17:42,92 --> 0:17:45,88
Trev, I understand you've been living it
rough for quite some time now.


248
0:17:45,88 --> 0:17:49,84
What circumstances took you
to living in the tunnels?


249
0:17:49,84 --> 0:17:55,48
Uh... Well, it kept me and my mates
warm in the winter. Yeah.


250
0:17:55,48 --> 0:17:58,6
It all started out great,
chatting away to him.


251
0:17:58,6 --> 0:18:2,84
He started to tell me a little bit about,
you know, his circumstances,


252
0:18:2,84 --> 0:18:5,0
what led him to live in the tunnels.


253
0:18:5,0 --> 0:18:8,84
He started to really paint a picture
of what it was like there.


254
0:18:8,84 --> 0:18:11,88
And amongst your friends,
Alfie and Johnny and Harry


255
0:18:11,88 --> 0:18:13,72
and some of the others,


256
0:18:13,72 --> 0:18:19,56
do they still live down there... now?


257
0:18:19,56 --> 0:18:25,0
No.


258
0:18:25,0 --> 0:18:26,72
Trev?


259
0:18:26,72 --> 0:18:29,68
Hmm.
Are you OK? You comfortable?


260
0:18:29,68 --> 0:18:34,52
Hmm. Yeah.


261
0:18:34,52 --> 0:18:37,0
At that point in the interview,
I asked Trevor


262
0:18:37,0 --> 0:18:39,88
what he perhaps had
been through in the tunnels.


263
0:18:39,88 --> 0:18:42,76
I asked Trevor what he had seen.


264
0:18:42,76 --> 0:18:49,96
Clearly something
had happened to him.


265
0:18:49,96 --> 0:18:56,56
Trevor, did you know someone
who went missing?


266
0:18:56,56 --> 0:19:4,52
Trevor, did anything happen
to you down there?


267
0:19:4,52 --> 0:19:7,2
Trevor...


268
0:19:7,2 --> 0:19:10,96
.. are you alright?


269
0:19:10,96 --> 0:19:34,24
NO!


270
0:19:34,24 --> 0:19:37,96
Shit.


271
0:19:37,96 --> 0:19:40,28
Did you get that before?
Yeah. Yeah, I got it.


272
0:19:40,28 --> 0:19:43,32
Oh, my God...


273
0:19:43,32 --> 0:19:48,92
Crazy.
I know.


274
0:19:48,92 --> 0:19:52,16
After Trevor's interview, it was clear
we were onto something.


275
0:19:52,16 --> 0:19:55,2
AII the pieces of the puzzle were
symptoms of something deeper,


276
0:19:55,2 --> 0:19:56,72
I just didn't know what.


277
0:19:56,72 --> 0:19:58,64
I needed more.


278
0:19:58,64 --> 0:20:5,92
We needed to get down there.


279
0:20:5,92 --> 0:20:8,0
Your call
may be recorded for training purposes.


280
0:20:8,0 --> 0:20:20,92
Please advise your operator if you
do not wish your call to be recorded.


281
0:20:20,92 --> 0:20:22,64
Hello, this is Pam.


282
0:20:22,64 --> 0:20:24,84
Oh, hi, Pam, it's Natasha Warner here.
How are you?


283
0:20:24,84 --> 0:20:28,16
I'm well, Nat, and you?
Yeah, good, good, thanks.


284
0:20:28,16 --> 0:20:30,16
Look, I'm just wondering
if you can help me out.


285
0:20:30,16 --> 0:20:33,6
I'm working on a story and I need
to get into the tunnels under the CBD.


286
0:20:33,6 --> 0:20:35,84
Who do I need to talk to
to make that happen?


287
0:20:35,84 --> 0:20:38,28
Right. What's the story?


288
0:20:38,28 --> 0:20:40,64
Oh, look, I just need half an hour.


289
0:20:40,64 --> 0:20:47,52
Um... just hang on a sec...


290
0:20:47,52 --> 0:20:50,12
Nat, sorry -- I can't help you this time.


291
0:20:50,12 --> 0:20:51,6
What?


292
0:20:51,6 --> 0:20:53,24
Apparently no-one's getting in there,


293
0:20:53,24 --> 0:20:56,4
and I don't think you'll be getting
any special treatment.


294
0:20:56,4 --> 0:20:57,92
C'mon, Pam, it's me.


295
0:20:57,92 --> 0:21:3,4
Exactly. And people got burnt
last time. I can't do it.


296
0:21:3,4 --> 0:21:6,16
I really need this.
Look, Pam, can you help me out?


297
0:21:6,16 --> 0:21:13,6
I'm sorry, Nat. 'Bye.
Look, I just need half...


298
0:21:13,6 --> 0:21:15,92
I guess it's easier to look at it now


299
0:21:15,92 --> 0:21:21,8
and say that I was perhaps under
a lot of pressure to get this story.


300
0:21:21,8 --> 0:21:25,4
At the time I just...
I felt I was doing my job.


301
0:21:25,4 --> 0:21:27,6
I was so focused on just doing my job.


302
0:21:27,6 --> 0:21:29,6
There was a lot of rumours
kicking around


303
0:21:29,6 --> 0:21:32,64
she was in big trouble, and she
kind of really needed to lift her game


304
0:21:32,64 --> 0:21:35,6
otherwise she was gone.


305
0:21:35,6 --> 0:21:38,4
Well, I think that I'd put
a lot of work into my career


306
0:21:38,4 --> 0:21:43,64
and I think it was all basically
hanging on this one... one story.


307
0:21:43,64 --> 0:21:46,12
You know, I didn't really have a choice.


308
0:21:46,12 --> 0:21:48,52
Hey, Tangles,
how's your head, mate?


309
0:21:48,52 --> 0:21:52,4
Pete, I'm like a fucking shark.
As long as I keep moving, I'll be OK.


310
0:21:52,4 --> 0:21:53,88
Here we go -- this is what you looked like


311
0:21:53,88 --> 0:21:57,16
after Steve pulled you
out of the loo last night.


312
0:21:57,16 --> 0:21:59,4
Oh, Steve, new toy.


313
0:21:59,4 --> 0:22:2,48
Mate, waterproof, baby! A TG!
All the gear, yeah.


314
0:22:2,48 --> 0:22:4,0
Good at spending the network's money.


315
0:22:4,0 --> 0:22:6,36
It's not just water-resistant,
it's fully waterproof?


316
0:22:6,36 --> 0:22:7,84
Yeah, waterproof, mate.


317
0:22:7,84 --> 0:22:11,92
Yeah, can you roll up for me?
I'll, uh, give it a bit of sound. There it is.


318
0:22:11,92 --> 0:22:14,4
Sure, mate.
Sweet.


319
0:22:14,4 --> 0:22:16,16
Rolling.
Uh, great.


320
0:22:16,16 --> 0:22:19,92
Pete, I'll just
get you to say some shit.


321
0:22:19,92 --> 0:22:22,28
Hang on...
One, two.


322
0:22:22,28 --> 0:22:25,32
Here, mate, just say some shit to that.
"Some shit to that."


323
0:22:25,32 --> 0:22:28,84
Um, yes, very excited to be
going down the smelly sewers...


324
0:22:28,84 --> 0:22:30,32
Hello. How'd you go?


325
0:22:30,32 --> 0:22:34,84
Haven't got all the permits sorted
but, um, John's got us covered, OK?


326
0:22:34,84 --> 0:22:38,16
When Natasha said that John
was covering us


327
0:22:38,16 --> 0:22:40,4
and we didn't have permits...


328
0:22:40,4 --> 0:22:42,56
That's kind of a pretty loose
arrangement,


329
0:22:42,56 --> 0:22:46,4
you know, you just sort of sit there
and go, "Oh, well, we must be fine."


330
0:22:46,4 --> 0:22:49,8
You sure?
Yeah.


331
0:22:49,8 --> 0:22:51,24
When?
We're on for tonight.


332
0:22:51,24 --> 0:22:53,8
Tonight? OK. So we are up?
Yeah, mate.


333
0:22:53,8 --> 0:22:56,96
Yep, tonight. You good?
Yeah, sweet. Yeah, I'm good, man.


334
0:22:56,96 --> 0:23:0,12
Alright.
The sooner we go, the better, hey?


335
0:23:0,12 --> 0:23:2,76
Yep.


336
0:23:2,76 --> 0:23:6,84
As a crew, it's... it's our job
to film it and get coverage.


337
0:23:6,84 --> 0:23:24,2
It's really not our job to question it.


338
0:23:24,2 --> 0:23:27,24
Hey, Pete, just hang back. I'm just
gonna get a shot of Nat walking in.


339
0:23:27,24 --> 0:23:28,24
Yeah? OK.


340
0:23:28,24 --> 0:23:32,4
Excuse me, guys?
Guys... Hold up, restricted area.


341
0:23:32,4 --> 0:23:34,2
Oh, sorry, mate.
Maybe no-one told you.


342
0:23:34,2 --> 0:23:37,44
We're just gonna be filming for about
half an hour. We'll be out of your hair.


343
0:23:37,44 --> 0:23:40,68
Just grabbing a few shots...
I'll need to see a permit.


344
0:23:40,68 --> 0:23:46,56
Permit?
Yeah, uh...


345
0:23:46,56 --> 0:23:53,92
You got a permit?
I've got a driver's licence.


346
0:23:53,92 --> 0:23:59,36
Pete... how much have
you got in your wallet?


347
0:23:59,36 --> 0:24:24,88
You're kidding me, aren't you?


348
0:24:24,88 --> 0:24:28,12
We're not third world here,
it's not gonna work.


349
0:24:28,12 --> 0:24:31,4
Guys? Everyone, time to leave, please.


350
0:24:31,4 --> 0:24:32,52
Told you.
Fucking hell.


351
0:24:32,52 --> 0:24:39,44
Let's go, come on.


352
0:24:39,44 --> 0:24:45,88
I was that far into it
I couldn't go back at that point.


353
0:24:45,88 --> 0:24:48,16
We decided to find another way in,


354
0:24:48,16 --> 0:25:7,92
with or without official... assistance.


355
0:25:7,92 --> 0:25:10,24
We found some access
round the other side.


356
0:25:10,24 --> 0:25:19,76
Yeah, it looked like
a maintenance access.


357
0:25:19,76 --> 0:25:26,88
You sure John's got this sorted?
Grow some balls, Pete.


358
0:25:26,88 --> 0:25:32,56
I, at that point,
was starting to feel as though


359
0:25:32,56 --> 0:25:34,32
there was something not quite right.


360
0:25:34,32 --> 0:25:39,16
Um, so I thought,
to cover myself and to cover Tangles,


361
0:25:39,16 --> 0:25:41,28
and really to cover all of us,


362
0:25:41,28 --> 0:25:43,76
I'd just film pretty much everything
that was happening there.


363
0:25:43,76 --> 0:25:45,76
You know, I thought we had to have


364
0:25:45,76 --> 0:25:47,56
some sort of way of
protecting ourselves,


365
0:25:47,56 --> 0:25:49,48
should something go wrong.


366
0:25:49,48 --> 0:25:52,44
You know, if we got busted
and fined or whatever, arrested,


367
0:25:52,44 --> 0:25:55,92
um, you know, I had some
evidence it wasn't me


368
0:25:55,92 --> 0:25:58,44
trying to push us down there,
and it wasn't Tangles,


369
0:25:58,44 --> 0:26:2,44
but it was Natasha.


370
0:26:2,44 --> 0:26:11,48
Here -- take this.


371
0:26:11,48 --> 0:26:14,16
Here we go.


372
0:26:14,16 --> 0:26:19,28
OK, let's go.


373
0:26:19,28 --> 0:26:20,88
You right? You want me to...
Take this.


374
0:26:20,88 --> 0:26:21,92
Yep.


375
0:26:21,92 --> 0:26:44,44
OK, make it quick.


376
0:26:44,44 --> 0:26:47,56
We just were kind of covering
our tracks as we went down --


377
0:26:47,56 --> 0:26:50,6
you know, we didn't want
to get discovered.


378
0:26:50,6 --> 0:26:53,88
Looking back on that...


379
0:26:53,88 --> 0:27:0,8
..that was probably a mistake.


380
0:27:0,8 --> 0:27:1,56
We OK?
Hey?


381
0:27:1,56 --> 0:27:3,24
Are we OK to be down here?


382
0:27:3,24 --> 0:27:26,32
That's what she said.
She said John's got us covered.


383
0:27:26,32 --> 0:27:28,2
When we start filming a story --


384
0:27:28,2 --> 0:27:31,28
when we actually start
"OK, let's get it, let's roll" --


385
0:27:31,28 --> 0:27:34,8
Pete and Natasha,
they look after the editorial content,


386
0:27:34,8 --> 0:27:38,32
and, you know, it's kind of
my job to take over there


387
0:27:38,32 --> 0:27:39,96
and look after the pictures.


388
0:27:39,96 --> 0:27:43,2
OK, turn around and come back.
I'll just get you walking past this grill.


389
0:27:43,2 --> 0:27:50,36
You guys just hang back
there for a second.


390
0:27:50,36 --> 0:27:53,28
Tangles and I would go off
and we'd just start


391
0:27:53,28 --> 0:27:55,92
getting stuck into it,
filming like we always would.


392
0:27:55,92 --> 0:28:5,56
You know, don't really need direction,
we'd just get into it.


393
0:28:5,56 --> 0:28:9,28
Once we got in sort of a little bit further,
there were whole sections of tunnels


394
0:28:9,28 --> 0:28:12,72
that were absolutely,
absolutely pitch black.


395
0:28:12,72 --> 0:28:16,24
It is completely black down there.


396
0:28:16,24 --> 0:28:19,88
You know, you could go in there,
turn the light off, spin around


397
0:28:19,88 --> 0:28:21,68
and you wouldn't know where you were.


398
0:28:21,68 --> 0:28:24,52
'Cause there's junctions,
tunnels going off everywhere.


399
0:28:24,52 --> 0:28:26,0
So I kind of thought...


400
0:28:26,0 --> 0:28:28,64
The first time I turned off the light
and stood there, I thought


401
0:28:28,64 --> 0:28:32,16
we're gonna have to keep the light on
and stay across where we are


402
0:28:32,16 --> 0:28:35,4
'cause otherwise it's going to be
pretty easy to get lost down there.


403
0:28:35,4 --> 0:28:37,2
Hey, Tangles?
Yeah?


404
0:28:37,2 --> 0:28:38,68
Just come here, mate.


405
0:28:38,68 --> 0:28:40,92
There's something wrong with
my light. Can you check it out?


406
0:28:40,92 --> 0:28:42,52
What do you mean?
Is it the connection?


407
0:28:42,52 --> 0:28:45,32
Yeah, can you look in real close?
Is there something stuck on it?


408
0:28:45,32 --> 0:28:46,8
Ah, shit!


409
0:28:46,8 --> 0:28:52,0
How did I not see that coming?


410
0:28:52,0 --> 0:28:56,24
Thanks for that, Steve.
My eyes are stuffed.


411
0:28:56,24 --> 0:28:57,72
Great.
Let's go.


412
0:28:57,72 --> 0:28:59,32
Pete had sourced a map of the tunnels,


413
0:28:59,32 --> 0:29:3,0
but the further we got in, the more
we realised it wasn't exactly accurate.


414
0:29:3,0 --> 0:29:7,68
There were whole sections of tunnels
that weren't even on the map.


415
0:29:7,68 --> 0:29:13,24
Just give us some light here, Steve.


416
0:29:13,24 --> 0:29:22,28
OK. So that's the entrance,
that's where we came down before...


417
0:29:22,28 --> 0:29:25,24
That's that way. That's not here...
I don't know why that is.


418
0:29:25,24 --> 0:29:26,8
OK, through here.


419
0:29:26,8 --> 0:29:29,68
Yep. That must be the way.


420
0:29:29,68 --> 0:29:32,64
Once we got through
and past the maintenance areas


421
0:29:32,64 --> 0:29:36,16
and we got into a little bit more
of the guts of the tunnels,


422
0:29:36,16 --> 0:29:38,76
my impressions were
that... that it was amazing.


423
0:29:38,76 --> 0:29:42,16
It was vast, this place was huge.


424
0:29:42,16 --> 0:29:44,8
That's awesome.


425
0:29:44,8 --> 0:29:47,88
Shit, the sound's great.


426
0:29:47,88 --> 0:29:51,56
Pete? Can I have 10 minutes
to grab some overlay here?


427
0:29:51,56 --> 0:29:53,4
I'll give you five.


428
0:29:53,4 --> 0:29:54,52
Five?
Yep.


429
0:29:54,52 --> 0:29:57,4
We were very close
to the station there, so, um,


430
0:29:57,4 --> 0:30:7,24
you know, Pete was trying
to make us pretty low-key.


431
0:30:7,24 --> 0:30:22,76
I was blown away by the size of it --
it was massive, and just eerie.


432
0:30:22,76 --> 0:30:35,4
You know, I think
we were all in awe of it.


433
0:30:35,4 --> 0:30:38,72
It wasn't really difficult to get
great-looking shots down there,


434
0:30:38,72 --> 0:30:41,32
you know, 'cause you're really just
painting stuff with your light


435
0:30:41,32 --> 0:31:5,28
and whatever you saw there just was...
it looked really cool.


436
0:31:5,28 --> 0:31:21,8
This is looking really good.
Hey, guys, just hush for a sec.


437
0:31:21,8 --> 0:31:24,92
Alright, looks good. Yeah, sweet.


438
0:31:24,92 --> 0:31:28,16
The history to these tunnels, the ones
in particular that we were looking at,


439
0:31:28,16 --> 0:31:29,92
was just incredible.


440
0:31:29,92 --> 0:31:32,76
I mean, it dates back pre-World War II.


441
0:31:32,76 --> 0:31:37,44
They were to be used as
an underground rail system.


442
0:31:37,44 --> 0:31:45,88
Then in World War II
they were used as air raid shelters.


443
0:31:45,88 --> 0:31:52,28
Come have a look at this.


444
0:31:52,28 --> 0:31:53,96
The current NSW government


445
0:31:53,96 --> 0:31:57,72
is not the first to use these
tunnels for another purpose.


446
0:31:57,72 --> 0:31:59,52
I'm standing in a section of tunnel


447
0:31:59,52 --> 0:32:3,48
that was converted into an
air raid shelter during World War ll.


448
0:32:3,48 --> 0:32:5,68
It's complete with all the amenities


449
0:32:5,68 --> 0:32:12,28
that enabled soldiers to stay
for extended periods.


450
0:32:12,28 --> 0:32:14,12
Various rooms were then, um,


451
0:32:14,12 --> 0:32:18,84
reused and fashioned
for training for the SAS.


452
0:32:18,84 --> 0:32:23,4
So time and time again they've,
I guess, been reinvented for their use,


453
0:32:23,4 --> 0:32:35,6
and even to this day with the water
recycling plans that were announced.


454
0:32:35,6 --> 0:32:37,72
I was fortunate enough to
come across an area where


455
0:32:37,72 --> 0:32:40,96
it was evident that there was definitely,
you know, homeless


456
0:32:40,96 --> 0:32:43,8
or, you know, people living down there.


457
0:32:43,8 --> 0:32:46,84
That's good... good just here.


458
0:32:46,84 --> 0:32:50,72
I'm right to go?
Hang on a sec.


459
0:32:50,72 --> 0:32:53,24
Go when you're ready.


460
0:32:53,24 --> 0:32:55,84
We've been walking in
the tunnel for less than an hour,


461
0:32:55,84 --> 0:32:58,56
and already we've come
across somebody's home.


462
0:32:58,56 --> 0:33:2,76
Here you can see their
makeshift bed, blanket


463
0:33:2,76 --> 0:33:4,48
and empty tins of food.


464
0:33:4,48 --> 0:33:8,0
Coming across the belongings
was very important --


465
0:33:8,0 --> 0:33:9,76
it was vital to the story.


466
0:33:9,76 --> 0:33:13,84
It was absolute proof
that there was life down here.


467
0:33:13,84 --> 0:33:16,28
While there is no sign of
an occupant at the moment,


468
0:33:16,28 --> 0:33:21,64
it is clear the minister's assertions
of abandoned tunnels are incorrect.


469
0:33:21,64 --> 0:33:23,84
This was something that
the government were denying.


470
0:33:23,84 --> 0:33:29,8
This is something
that we could now prove.


471
0:33:29,8 --> 0:33:31,64
Hey, Nat, I'll get a shot of you
going down there, actually.


472
0:33:31,64 --> 0:33:33,12
Yeah, cool.


473
0:33:33,12 --> 0:33:36,0
Oh, hey. Light.


474
0:33:36,0 --> 0:33:48,28
Cheers.


475
0:33:48,28 --> 0:33:50,96
Mate, what's up?
What? Nothing.


476
0:33:50,96 --> 0:33:54,8
It's a bit tight down there, tubby.
You reckon you're gonna make it?


477
0:33:54,8 --> 0:33:58,12
He mustn't like working on the show.


478
0:33:58,12 --> 0:33:59,6
Nat! You alright?
Nat, you alright?


479
0:33:59,6 --> 0:34:0,72
Yeah, I'm right.


480
0:34:0,72 --> 0:34:4,52
Do you need a hand?
No, I'm fine.


481
0:34:4,52 --> 0:34:8,44
Nat? Look, we've already
got the sleeping bags and stuff,


482
0:34:8,44 --> 0:34:10,4
we don't really need to get the lake.


483
0:34:10,4 --> 0:34:12,28
We could probably do the rest up here.
Pete... Pete, I'm alright.


484
0:34:12,28 --> 0:34:14,12
I just think it's a little...
I'm fine!


485
0:34:14,12 --> 0:34:17,48
Just let's keep going.


486
0:34:17,48 --> 0:34:19,0
Alright, you take that.
Yeah.


487
0:34:19,0 --> 0:34:22,2
What's eating her?
Oh, she just really needs the story.


488
0:34:22,2 --> 0:34:24,76
After what happened last time,
she's treading on thin ice.


489
0:34:24,76 --> 0:34:26,28
Yeah, I reckon.


490
0:34:26,28 --> 0:34:29,8
That's why John put me onto this --
make sure she doesn't fuck up again.


491
0:34:29,8 --> 0:34:31,72
If she's not up to it,
why doesn't he give her the arse?


492
0:34:31,72 --> 0:34:34,4
Mate, I think John'd wanna
give her a little more than just that.


493
0:34:34,4 --> 0:34:36,64
Well, he'd have to get in line
behind you, wouldn't he?


494
0:34:36,64 --> 0:34:39,96
Hey, guys, you might
wanna know for future reference


495
0:34:39,96 --> 0:34:41,96
that these tunnels
carry sound pretty well.


496
0:34:41,96 --> 0:34:47,44
And as far as I can hear,
you're all arseholes.


497
0:34:47,44 --> 0:34:49,36
Fuck off!


498
0:34:49,36 --> 0:34:52,96
Yeah, give me the torch.
Right, yeah, hang on.


499
0:34:52,96 --> 0:34:56,6
There you go, mate.


500
0:34:56,6 --> 0:35:0,64
Get down there, you arsehole.


501
0:35:0,64 --> 0:35:5,24
Pete, can you just lift that handle up
for me? Get a bit of sound.


502
0:35:5,24 --> 0:35:11,36
Where to? Just...


503
0:35:11,36 --> 0:35:13,2
Yeah, nice.
Give it a kick.


504
0:35:13,2 --> 0:35:16,36
Yeah, give it a kick.
Send it on its way.


505
0:35:16,36 --> 0:35:18,68
What are we doing?
Just... just give it a kick.


506
0:35:18,68 --> 0:35:21,96
You call it.


507
0:35:21,96 --> 0:35:31,88
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro.


508
0:35:31,88 --> 0:35:55,24
Thanks, guys.


509
0:35:55,24 --> 0:35:58,32
The lake was just... so... vast.


510
0:35:58,32 --> 0:36:1,68
I mean, this thing runs
a kilometre long.


511
0:36:1,68 --> 0:36:4,48
It's bigger than I thought.


512
0:36:4,48 --> 0:36:7,44
Yeah, I get that a lot.


513
0:36:7,44 --> 0:36:9,4
Me and Tangles were
mucking around a bit --


514
0:36:9,4 --> 0:36:12,44
we like to play jokes on each other.


515
0:36:12,44 --> 0:36:15,6
You know, if I didn't do it,
he would've done it.


516
0:36:15,6 --> 0:36:17,44
So I just grabbed him
and sort of went...


517
0:36:17,44 --> 0:36:19,44
..you know, at the edge of the lake,
went to push him in.


518
0:36:19,44 --> 0:36:21,44
You know how you go up,
hold onto their shoulders


519
0:36:21,44 --> 0:36:22,92
and pull them back again?


520
0:36:22,92 --> 0:36:26,52
Which I did, and then I let go of him,
and went to walk back to the camera --


521
0:36:26,52 --> 0:36:29,68
in he went.


522
0:36:29,68 --> 0:36:32,32
Shit.
Tangles, are you right?


523
0:36:32,32 --> 0:36:35,24
Yeah, slipped.
There's your dip, mate.


524
0:36:35,24 --> 0:36:37,8
Steve, you... prick.


525
0:36:37,8 --> 0:36:39,6
Oi, this is not funny. It's fucking cold.


526
0:36:39,6 --> 0:36:46,2
Are you gonna give him a hand?
No, fuck him!


527
0:36:46,2 --> 0:36:48,6
This is not... Stop laughing, OK?


528
0:36:48,6 --> 0:36:50,64
How long are we gonna be
down here, alright?


529
0:36:50,64 --> 0:36:54,36
Tangles, as much as we used to
joke around and muck around together,


530
0:36:54,36 --> 0:36:57,4
when it came time to work,
you know, he was very serious,


531
0:36:57,4 --> 0:36:59,84
and it wasn't time for joking.


532
0:36:59,84 --> 0:37:2,56
Creative department's ready.
Just letting you know.


533
0:37:2,56 --> 0:37:5,2
OK.


534
0:37:5,2 --> 0:37:7,36
Nat, just come forward a fraction.


535
0:37:7,36 --> 0:37:10,36
So, you know, when he's sort of
giving me the impression


536
0:37:10,36 --> 0:37:12,72
that there were problems,
I was believing him.


537
0:37:12,72 --> 0:37:16,72
I'm standing directly below
one of Sydney's busiest train stations.


538
0:37:16,72 --> 0:37:19,32
Behind me is the forgotten
water resource


539
0:37:19,32 --> 0:37:21,6
that's causing all the controversy.


540
0:37:21,6 --> 0:37:23,2
Earlier this year the government...


541
0:37:23,2 --> 0:37:25,96
Nat, sorry. Pete, are you making noise?
No.


542
0:37:25,96 --> 0:37:29,2
You weren't whispering?
No.


543
0:37:29,2 --> 0:37:31,4
Alright. Sorry, Nat.
Can we go from the top?


544
0:37:31,4 --> 0:37:35,6
Everyone, just keep it quiet. Thank you.


545
0:37:35,6 --> 0:37:38,16
OK, let's go from the top again.
Let's move.


546
0:37:38,16 --> 0:37:42,24
When you're ready, Nat.


547
0:37:42,24 --> 0:37:46,4
I'm standing directly below one of
Sydney's busiest train stations.


548
0:37:46,4 --> 0:37:48,36
Behind me is the forgotten
water resource...


549
0:37:48,36 --> 0:37:51,4
Nat, sorry. Are you guys
fucking with me? What's the noise?


550
0:37:51,4 --> 0:37:53,12
What are you hearing, mate?


551
0:37:53,12 --> 0:37:56,16
It's... Hang on, I'll just check the battery.


552
0:37:56,16 --> 0:37:58,72
Sweet, um, I don't know.


553
0:37:58,72 --> 0:38:1,32
Maybe it's your cables.
Yeah, cables don't fucking talk, Steve.


554
0:38:1,32 --> 0:38:4,2
Uh, alright. Sorry, Nat.
Go for it again, I'll see what I can do.


555
0:38:4,2 --> 0:38:7,2
Just go straight through.


556
0:38:7,2 --> 0:38:12,72
If Tangles says he heard something,
I do believe he felt he heard something.


557
0:38:12,72 --> 0:38:16,4
I can't describe
how silent the place was,


558
0:38:16,4 --> 0:38:22,4
so at the time I didn't feel that...
he could have been hearing anything.


559
0:38:22,4 --> 0:38:24,52
It... it was strange.


560
0:38:24,52 --> 0:38:28,56
I was just thinking, you know,
it could have been a technical problem,


561
0:38:28,56 --> 0:38:33,8
could have been anything -- some
RF interference, anything like that.


562
0:38:33,8 --> 0:38:37,24
But, you know, Tangles was adamant
there was something going on,


563
0:38:37,24 --> 0:38:43,48
and, uh, when he's serious about
something, you know, you believe him.


564
0:38:43,48 --> 0:38:45,64
Earlier this year,
the government announced,


565
0:38:45,64 --> 0:38:49,24
then quietly abandoned,
plans to recycle water from this lake.


566
0:38:49,24 --> 0:38:54,44
The Minister for Water
has yet to give a reason why.


567
0:38:54,44 --> 0:38:59,12
Beautiful. Pete, happy?
I'm happy. How are you, Tangles?


568
0:38:59,12 --> 0:39:2,24
Oh... yeah. Yeah, sweet, yeah.


569
0:39:2,24 --> 0:39:6,56
Alright, let's go.
Let's move, grab the sticks.


570
0:39:6,56 --> 0:39:11,56
Alright, let's go.


571
0:39:11,56 --> 0:39:14,24
After we'd finished
our piece at the lake, um,


572
0:39:14,24 --> 0:39:20,8
we decided to head for the bell room.


573
0:39:20,8 --> 0:39:21,56
Righto, Nat.


574
0:39:21,56 --> 0:39:26,96
Basically the bell room was built as like
a air raid sort of alert back in the war.


575
0:39:26,96 --> 0:39:31,68
They would use it
to warn people of danger.


576
0:39:31,68 --> 0:39:35,24
When we rang the bell,
it... it was deafening.


577
0:39:35,24 --> 0:39:37,4
It rattled your ribs.


578
0:39:37,4 --> 0:39:40,8
This bell is a relic of World War ll.


579
0:39:40,8 --> 0:39:43,12
It remains here in the confines
of an air raid shelter,


580
0:39:43,12 --> 0:39:51,32
as a reminder of what
imminent danger sounds like.


581
0:39:51,32 --> 0:39:54,92
Shit, that blew my levels
right off the meter, sorry. Um...


582
0:39:54,92 --> 0:39:57,52
Hang on. Nat, can you just
hit the bell once more?


583
0:39:57,52 --> 0:40:3,88
Yep. Ready to go?
Yep.


584
0:40:3,88 --> 0:40:4,88
How's that?


585
0:40:4,88 --> 0:40:6,72
Nah, look, if you want me to get that,


586
0:40:6,72 --> 0:40:8,72
it's probably best I boom it
from down the hall.


587
0:40:8,72 --> 0:40:12,84
Yeah, OK. Well, if we need it.
OK, cool, two seconds.


588
0:40:12,84 --> 0:40:18,8
Tangles decided to, um, go into
the adjoining room off the bell room


589
0:40:18,8 --> 0:40:20,28
and boom it from there


590
0:40:20,28 --> 0:40:24,48
just to basically kill the sound
of the level of the bell,


591
0:40:24,48 --> 0:40:28,2
which was just making
his levels peak out.


592
0:40:28,2 --> 0:40:30,56
I don't really know much
about recording sound,


593
0:40:30,56 --> 0:40:35,16
but I did at the time remember
thinking, "That's a bit weird."


594
0:40:35,16 --> 0:40:38,64
You know, why would you do that?
Just turn it down a little bit.


595
0:40:38,64 --> 0:40:40,84
Surely it's that simple?


596
0:40:40,84 --> 0:40:42,44
Uh, Steve, can you do me a favour?


597
0:40:42,44 --> 0:40:44,84
Can you just listen on the cans,
watch the levels for me?


598
0:40:44,84 --> 0:40:48,68
Why don't you get Pete to do it? He can
do camera, he must be able to do sound.


599
0:40:48,68 --> 0:40:51,28
Nah, mate, I've done
enough hard work today.


600
0:40:51,28 --> 0:40:56,4
That's good, Nat, yeah.
I'll do it for ya, mate.


601
0:40:56,4 --> 0:40:59,36
Sorry, guys, it's just
way too echoey in here.


602
0:40:59,36 --> 0:41:2,4
He asked me to listen
to the audio for him,


603
0:41:2,4 --> 0:41:3,88
which was fine.


604
0:41:3,88 --> 0:41:7,56
It's just put on the headphones
and listen to it as it's being recorded.


605
0:41:7,56 --> 0:41:15,16
Here, Tangles. Take that.
Thanks very much.


606
0:41:15,16 --> 0:41:17,92
And then so Nat just went
ahead and did it again,


607
0:41:17,92 --> 0:41:22,28
and, uh... that's...


608
0:41:22,28 --> 0:41:25,4
That's when, uh...


609
0:41:25,4 --> 0:41:30,92
..that's when I heard it.


610
0:41:30,92 --> 0:41:33,12
Yeah, ready to go.


611
0:41:33,12 --> 0:41:34,76
Bell atmos.


612
0:41:34,76 --> 0:41:42,8
Whenever you're ready, Nat.


613
0:41:42,8 --> 0:41:45,8
What the fuck?


614
0:41:45,8 --> 0:41:51,36
Did you... did you hear that?
Yeah.


615
0:41:51,36 --> 0:41:52,88
Yo, Tangles!


616
0:41:52,88 --> 0:41:54,36
Tangles!


617
0:41:54,36 --> 0:41:56,88
Shit.
Tangles!


618
0:41:56,88 --> 0:42:1,56
Pete, we need some light
down here, mate. Tangles!


619
0:42:1,56 --> 0:42:4,72
Quick, light.
Shit. Steve, where are you?


620
0:42:4,72 --> 0:42:6,56
Down here. Straight, straight, straight.


621
0:42:6,56 --> 0:42:8,8
Just give us the camera, mate.
He's... he's gone.


622
0:42:8,8 --> 0:42:10,76
Where'd he go?
Tangles!


623
0:42:10,76 --> 0:42:12,56
What did you hear in the headphones?
Tangles!


624
0:42:12,56 --> 0:42:14,4
What did you hear in your headphones?


625
0:42:14,4 --> 0:42:15,88
Tangles!


626
0:42:15,88 --> 0:42:18,0
Would he be dickin' us round?


627
0:42:18,0 --> 0:42:20,28
Tangles!
Tangles, come on, mate!


628
0:42:20,28 --> 0:42:22,48
Steve, through here.


629
0:42:22,48 --> 0:42:26,28
Tangles!
Tangles!


630
0:42:26,28 --> 0:42:28,32
Yo, Tangles!
Here, I'll go down here.


631
0:42:28,32 --> 0:42:29,32
Yeah.


632
0:42:29,32 --> 0:42:31,16
You know, I knew
there was something wrong.


633
0:42:31,16 --> 0:42:33,4
I knew he wasn't mucking around.


634
0:42:33,4 --> 0:42:36,8
My initial thought
was just to get to him.


635
0:42:36,8 --> 0:42:37,84
It wasn't unlike them,


636
0:42:37,84 --> 0:42:44,0
so I guess my first instinct was
that they were having a joke.


637
0:42:44,0 --> 0:42:46,4
What, Nat thought we were
playing a prank, did she?


638
0:42:46,4 --> 0:42:48,68
You've spoken to her?


639
0:42:48,68 --> 0:43:14,76
She thought we were fucking around?


640
0:43:14,76 --> 0:43:17,96
Tangles, you good?


641
0:43:17,96 --> 0:43:21,32
Yep. Ready to go.


642
0:43:21,32 --> 0:43:57,88
Bell atmos.


643
0:43:57,88 --> 0:44:1,44
Tangles!


644
0:44:1,44 --> 0:44:3,32
Maybe through here...
No, that's a dead end.


645
0:44:3,32 --> 0:44:5,84
Tangles!


646
0:44:5,84 --> 0:44:10,2
Watch your step.
Tangles!


647
0:44:10,2 --> 0:44:11,76
Ah, great.
What's up?


648
0:44:11,76 --> 0:44:13,24
Battery.
You alright?


649
0:44:13,24 --> 0:44:14,72
Yeah, fuck. It's alright.


650
0:44:14,72 --> 0:44:16,96
Need the light? You got a spare?


651
0:44:16,96 --> 0:44:20,24
Yeah, it's in here, hang on.
OK.


652
0:44:20,24 --> 0:44:23,48
It became pretty evident, quite quickly,


653
0:44:23,48 --> 0:44:28,24
that we weren't gonna be able to
find anyone or anything without light.


654
0:44:28,24 --> 0:44:31,68
Got it.


655
0:44:31,68 --> 0:44:34,16
We'll get him, mate. We'll find him.
We'll find him, alright?


656
0:44:34,16 --> 0:44:35,64
Tangles!


657
0:44:35,64 --> 0:44:39,96
Now, I had my camera light
and I knew I had about


658
0:44:39,96 --> 0:44:43,36
two, maybe three
hours tops worth of light.


659
0:44:43,36 --> 0:44:44,84
Steve, where's your kit?
Tangles!


660
0:44:44,84 --> 0:44:46,32
Steve, where's your kit?
What?


661
0:44:46,32 --> 0:44:48,6
Where's your kit?
It's back in the bell room.


662
0:44:48,6 --> 0:44:52,4
OK. well... all the torches
are back there, aren't they?


663
0:44:52,4 --> 0:44:54,36
This is the only light you've got
and it's fucking around.


664
0:44:54,36 --> 0:44:57,0
We need the torches, mate.
We've gotta go back to the bell room.


665
0:44:57,0 --> 0:44:58,0
But Tangles...


666
0:44:58,0 --> 0:44:59,84
It's alright. We'll get him.
We'll find him. C'mon.


667
0:44:59,84 --> 0:45:3,4
Fuck.
C'mon.


668
0:45:3,4 --> 0:45:5,76
Walked back into the bell room
and there was nothing.


669
0:45:5,76 --> 0:45:8,4
There was nothing there.
AII the stuff had disappeared.


670
0:45:8,4 --> 0:45:10,2
Now, that was only in a matter of...


671
0:45:10,2 --> 0:45:11,8
I don't know, couldn't
have been too long.


672
0:45:11,8 --> 0:45:13,72
Shit, everything's gone.
What?


673
0:45:13,72 --> 0:45:15,2
What the hell's going on?


674
0:45:15,2 --> 0:45:17,4
It certainly raised some
concern because I didn't feel


675
0:45:17,4 --> 0:45:20,92
it was something that
Tangles could do by himself.


676
0:45:20,92 --> 0:45:21,92
Fuck!


677
0:45:21,92 --> 0:45:23,64
Hey, we're wasting time, guys. Let's go!


678
0:45:23,64 --> 0:45:26,16
Wait.
C'mon!


679
0:45:26,16 --> 0:45:28,44
Here, take this.
Pete!


680
0:45:28,44 --> 0:45:32,8
Just give me some light, Steve.


681
0:45:32,8 --> 0:45:34,72
OK.


682
0:45:34,72 --> 0:45:37,76
OK, Tangles went through here.


683
0:45:37,76 --> 0:45:39,68
If we follow that all the way round,


684
0:45:39,68 --> 0:45:42,32
it brings us back to this room,
we can scan the whole area.


685
0:45:42,32 --> 0:45:44,6
OK. So we split up
and meet back here, yeah?


686
0:45:44,6 --> 0:45:46,6
No, we stick together.
That's the only light we've got.


687
0:45:46,6 --> 0:45:48,8
How many batteries
have you got left?


688
0:45:48,8 --> 0:45:49,92
I've got two in my pouch, mate.
Let's go.


689
0:45:49,92 --> 0:45:53,76
Steve... STEVE!
Oh, fuck!


690
0:45:53,76 --> 0:45:56,8
It won't do Tangles any good
if we run round like headless chooks.


691
0:45:56,8 --> 0:45:58,52
We stick together, alright?


692
0:45:58,52 --> 0:46:0,88
You'd better keep up, then.


693
0:46:0,88 --> 0:46:3,8
Tangles!
Steve, wait!


694
0:46:3,8 --> 0:46:5,88
C'mon, Nat.
Tangles!


695
0:46:5,88 --> 0:46:7,32
Yeah, I panicked.


696
0:46:7,32 --> 0:46:10,28
You know, it wasn't like
I 'm trying to be a hero or anything.


697
0:46:10,28 --> 0:46:13,6
You know, the smarter thing might
have been to do something else


698
0:46:13,6 --> 0:46:16,56
but it was just instinct
just kicking in.


699
0:46:16,56 --> 0:46:19,96
Tangles!


700
0:46:19,96 --> 0:46:23,52
So, what do you think?
Think of what?


701
0:46:23,52 --> 0:46:26,24
You know, Tangles,
is he dicking around?


702
0:46:26,24 --> 0:46:30,44
No, he wouldn't dick around
for this long.


703
0:46:30,44 --> 0:46:32,48
Who took our stuff, then?


704
0:46:32,48 --> 0:46:34,72
Who took it? I don't know.


705
0:46:34,72 --> 0:46:37,12
Could have been
the homeless, junkies...


706
0:46:37,12 --> 0:46:41,52
I heard it, Pete.
You heard what?


707
0:46:41,52 --> 0:46:46,28
Whatever it was, mate.
Well, what was it, mate?


708
0:46:46,28 --> 0:46:50,44
Steve?
Look, let's just get going, OK?


709
0:46:50,44 --> 0:46:57,2
Steve? Steve? What was it?


710
0:46:57,2 --> 0:47:0,96
Shit.
Watch your step.


711
0:47:0,96 --> 0:47:7,16
What's in here?


712
0:47:7,16 --> 0:47:17,12
Oh, fuck.


713
0:47:17,12 --> 0:47:27,2
You right?
Yeah.


714
0:47:27,2 --> 0:47:29,12
Nope, nothing.


715
0:47:29,12 --> 0:47:31,68
Pete, we've been here
twice before, mate.


716
0:47:31,68 --> 0:47:36,36
The only other place
has got to be the lake.


717
0:47:36,36 --> 0:47:39,16
Maybe he went back
from where we came.


718
0:47:39,16 --> 0:47:40,64
Maybe he's waiting for us.


719
0:47:40,64 --> 0:47:42,64
Oh, sure, mate. He's fucking
walked out in the pitch-black.


720
0:47:42,64 --> 0:47:44,92
He's at fucking Harry's, scoffing a pie.
I don't mean that.


721
0:47:44,92 --> 0:47:47,16
I mean he can't contact us.
Maybe he's waiting for us.


722
0:47:47,16 --> 0:47:49,12
No, Steve's right, OK?
Tangles is down here.


723
0:47:49,12 --> 0:47:55,44
He's got to be at the lake, mate.


724
0:47:55,44 --> 0:48:2,68
Well, how much light have you got?
I've got enough.


725
0:48:2,68 --> 0:48:5,12
Alright, then.


726
0:48:5,12 --> 0:48:10,48
Shh! Do you hear that?
Shh.


727
0:48:10,48 --> 0:48:15,32
Shh!


728
0:48:15,32 --> 0:48:16,84
Let's go!
Go.


729
0:48:16,84 --> 0:48:18,64
Tangles!


730
0:48:18,64 --> 0:48:20,68
Tangles!


731
0:48:20,68 --> 0:48:23,32
This way! Tangles!


732
0:48:23,32 --> 0:48:26,84
I heard him through here. Tangles!


733
0:48:26,84 --> 0:48:29,44
Tangles! I'm coming, mate!


734
0:48:29,44 --> 0:48:33,52
Oh, fuck it!
In here!


735
0:48:33,52 --> 0:48:35,0
Give us a hand. Quick.


736
0:48:35,0 --> 0:48:36,84
Get down and grab it at the bottom.


737
0:48:36,84 --> 0:48:41,64
Fuck it! Get it off! Get it open!


738
0:48:41,64 --> 0:48:44,4
Grab that back. Grab that.


739
0:48:44,4 --> 0:48:53,12
Oh, shit. Steve, help.


740
0:48:53,12 --> 0:48:55,12
Jesus.


741
0:48:55,12 --> 0:49:1,36
Steve, light. Light.


742
0:49:1,36 --> 0:49:20,8
Jesus Christ.


743
0:49:20,8 --> 0:49:22,16
Steve...
Yeah?


744
0:49:22,16 --> 0:49:31,8
His torch.


745
0:49:31,8 --> 0:49:38,4
It's his torch,
but it doesn't mean it's him, mate.


746
0:49:38,4 --> 0:49:40,96
I can't really describe it,
it was just...


747
0:49:40,96 --> 0:49:45,84
There was blood and...


748
0:49:45,84 --> 0:49:50,96
..over in the corner
was... Tangles's torch.


749
0:49:50,96 --> 0:49:54,96
I... I sort of thought of myself
as his older brother.


750
0:49:54,96 --> 0:49:58,0
You know, that was
the kind of relationship we had.


751
0:49:58,0 --> 0:50:2,28
And, uh, he was sort of
entrusted to me.


752
0:50:2,28 --> 0:50:10,48
That's the way I felt about it.


753
0:50:10,48 --> 0:50:12,96
Let's go.
Could be anyone.


754
0:50:12,96 --> 0:50:14,68
C'mon. We've got to move.


755
0:50:14,68 --> 0:50:17,56
She's right. He could be close, mate.
What about Tangles?


756
0:50:17,56 --> 0:50:21,16
Whatever that fucking thing is,
it could be nearby.


757
0:50:21,16 --> 0:50:23,72
Come on.


758
0:50:23,72 --> 0:50:27,52
It's Tangles.
Come on.


759
0:50:27,52 --> 0:50:34,2
Let's go.


760
0:50:34,2 --> 0:50:36,4
Wait.
What?


761
0:50:36,4 --> 0:50:40,4
Wait, where's my camera?


762
0:50:40,4 --> 0:50:43,16
Just over there.


763
0:50:43,16 --> 0:50:46,12
It's not where I left it.
What?


764
0:50:46,12 --> 0:50:49,44
It's not where I left it.


765
0:50:49,44 --> 0:50:52,28
Before we entered the room
Nat put the camera,


766
0:50:52,28 --> 0:50:54,56
the night vision camera, on the ground


767
0:50:54,56 --> 0:50:56,4
just outside the door.


768
0:50:56,4 --> 0:50:59,8
Um... and then we went in the room.


769
0:50:59,8 --> 0:51:1,84
We wouldn't have been in there
for more than two or three minutes,


770
0:51:1,84 --> 0:51:4,68
and then she came out,
we all came out together,


771
0:51:4,68 --> 0:51:6,48
and she noticed
the camera had been moved.


772
0:51:6,48 --> 0:51:14,68
My instinct was to check it
and see if it had recorded something.


773
0:51:14,68 --> 0:51:16,72
Play it back.


774
0:51:16,72 --> 0:51:20,72
Tangles!


775
0:51:20,72 --> 0:51:26,24
Tangles!


776
0:51:26,24 --> 0:51:27,96
Get down and grab it at the bottom.


777
0:51:27,96 --> 0:51:34,4
Fuck it. Get it off! Get it open!


778
0:51:34,4 --> 0:51:57,0
Grab that back. Grab that.


779
0:51:57,0 --> 0:51:59,96
We played back the footage and, uh,


780
0:51:59,96 --> 0:52:1,96
someone had picked up the camera,


781
0:52:1,96 --> 0:52:4,24
it had come off the ground,


782
0:52:4,24 --> 0:52:11,44
and there were shots of us in the room.


783
0:52:11,44 --> 0:52:20,92
It's his torch,
but it doesn't mean it's him, mate.


784
0:52:20,92 --> 0:52:23,92
Let's go.


785
0:52:23,92 --> 0:52:28,92
C'mon. We've got to move.
She's right. He could be close, mate.


786
0:52:28,92 --> 0:52:33,92
Whatever that fucking this is,
it could be nearby.


787
0:52:33,92 --> 0:52:36,4
It's Tangles.
Come on.


788
0:52:36,4 --> 0:52:40,44
Let's go.


789
0:52:40,44 --> 0:52:42,16
And then we turn to come out


790
0:52:42,16 --> 0:52:46,32
and... the camera goes down


791
0:52:46,32 --> 0:52:55,4
and we just catch a glimpse --
it was just like one frame.


792
0:52:55,4 --> 0:52:57,56
It happened in a split second.


793
0:52:57,56 --> 0:52:59,4
I didn't know what it was, mate,


794
0:52:59,4 --> 0:53:11,76
but it was quick
and it was fucking frightening.


795
0:53:11,76 --> 0:53:13,76
Fuck.


796
0:53:13,76 --> 0:53:21,8
Oi!


797
0:53:21,8 --> 0:53:25,2
This isn't good.


798
0:53:25,2 --> 0:53:29,28
We've got to get out of here.
We've got to get out of here.


799
0:53:29,28 --> 0:53:31,72
Mate, I am not fucking
leaving him down here


800
0:53:31,72 --> 0:53:33,2
with whatever the fuck that was.


801
0:53:33,2 --> 0:53:35,2
Steve, listen, listen to me.
I'm not fucking leaving him.


802
0:53:35,2 --> 0:53:37,2
Look, right now my priority
is with you and Nat.


803
0:53:37,2 --> 0:53:40,24
I'm not going to let what happened to
Tangles happen to both of you, alright?


804
0:53:40,24 --> 0:53:42,44
We have to get out to the top.


805
0:53:42,44 --> 0:53:44,4
You go on your own. Leave me here.


806
0:53:44,4 --> 0:53:46,68
Steve, we need your light. Come on.
You've got your own fucking light.


807
0:53:46,68 --> 0:53:48,64
Listen, Steve, listen to me.
Listen to me!


808
0:53:48,64 --> 0:53:49,96
Fuck off!
Listen to me!


809
0:53:49,96 --> 0:53:52,36
I'm not done!
Don't fucking touch me, man!


810
0:53:52,36 --> 0:53:55,12
Listen, listen!
Listen, listen, listen to me.


811
0:53:55,12 --> 0:53:56,8
Whatever that fucking thing is


812
0:53:56,8 --> 0:54:2,4
it's going to have a harder time
taking us out if we stick together.


813
0:54:2,4 --> 0:54:6,44
That's bullshit.
Listen. We need to get to the top.


814
0:54:6,44 --> 0:54:8,4
We need to get help.


815
0:54:8,4 --> 0:54:9,56
If we get more help down here,


816
0:54:9,56 --> 0:54:13,96
the better chance
we 're going to find Tangles.


817
0:54:13,96 --> 0:54:17,88
Fucking Tangles, man.
I know, mate.


818
0:54:17,88 --> 0:54:23,8
Hey, mate, I'm with you.
I'm with you.


819
0:54:23,8 --> 0:54:26,24
Come on.


820
0:54:26,24 --> 0:54:28,64
Come on.


821
0:54:28,64 --> 0:54:30,2
Pete made sense,


822
0:54:30,2 --> 0:54:35,76
but I couldn't help but feel like
I was leaving Tangles behind.


823
0:54:35,76 --> 0:54:41,68
It was the hardest thing
I've ever had to do.


824
0:54:41,68 --> 0:54:46,24
Is he OK?
Just give him a few minutes.


825
0:54:46,24 --> 0:54:47,88
So, what's the plan?


826
0:54:47,88 --> 0:54:54,4
We get the fuck out of here
is the plan. Get back to the top.


827
0:54:54,4 --> 0:54:57,48
What?


828
0:54:57,48 --> 0:55:8,16
I think we should stay
and look for Tangles.


829
0:55:8,16 --> 0:55:14,56
You're not here for Tangles.
You're not here for Tangles.


830
0:55:14,56 --> 0:55:19,96
Fuck!


831
0:55:19,96 --> 0:55:23,56
Just through here.


832
0:55:23,56 --> 0:55:26,52
Fuck!


833
0:55:26,52 --> 0:55:30,0
Back it up, back it up!
Hit the light. Kill the light.


834
0:55:30,0 --> 0:55:33,4
Fuck!
Shh!


835
0:55:33,4 --> 0:55:41,64
What is it, mate?
Shh, shh!


836
0:55:41,64 --> 0:55:43,16
Anyone down there?


837
0:55:43,16 --> 0:55:46,28
It's the guard.
Shit, it's the guard.


838
0:55:46,28 --> 0:55:50,6
Who's there?
Hey, mate, it's us. It's the film crew.


839
0:55:50,6 --> 0:55:52,44
I told you guys not to come down here.


840
0:55:52,44 --> 0:55:54,16
Yeah, look, I know, we're sorry.


841
0:55:54,16 --> 0:55:55,68
It's just our friend, he's gone missing.


842
0:55:55,68 --> 0:56:0,16
Someone... something's taken him.


843
0:56:0,16 --> 0:56:2,4
Right, I want all of you
to come with me now.


844
0:56:2,4 --> 0:56:5,28
Hey, come on!
Mate, what's happening in here?


845
0:56:5,28 --> 0:56:8,12
Mate, tell us what's happening in here!
Nat, give it a break, Nat.


846
0:56:8,12 --> 0:56:12,6
We're leaving. LET'S GO!
Is he going to help us?


847
0:56:12,6 --> 0:56:17,92
Go! Go! Run!


848
0:56:17,92 --> 0:56:19,4
Keep moving!


849
0:56:19,4 --> 0:56:23,4
Keep going.


850
0:56:23,4 --> 0:56:26,24
Keep going, Nat.


851
0:56:26,24 --> 0:56:27,8
Fuck!
Not that way.


852
0:56:27,8 --> 0:56:31,0
Here. Through here.


853
0:56:31,0 --> 0:56:32,68
Kill the light.
Hey?


854
0:56:32,68 --> 0:56:39,88
Steve, kill the light!


855
0:56:39,88 --> 0:57:4,68
Shh!


856
0:57:4,68 --> 0:57:13,2
Where are we?
Shh!


857
0:57:13,2 --> 0:57:16,4
What was that?


858
0:57:16,4 --> 0:57:23,36
I don't know.


859
0:57:23,36 --> 0:57:30,24
Just keep it down,
it could be close.


860
0:57:30,24 --> 0:57:36,0
Did you see it?
No.


861
0:57:36,0 --> 0:57:41,16
But whatever it was,
it was fucking huge.


862
0:57:41,16 --> 0:57:50,48
Nat... turn it off.


863
0:57:50,48 --> 0:57:52,8
Everybody alright?


864
0:57:52,8 --> 0:57:53,56
Mate, mate, I'm alright.


865
0:57:53,56 --> 0:57:57,4
How about your arm?


866
0:57:57,4 --> 0:57:59,56
Give me the camera.
Let me see.


867
0:57:59,56 --> 0:58:1,56
I hit something
when we were running. It's fine.


868
0:58:1,56 --> 0:58:4,8
Shit, Steve. It looks bad.
Nah.


869
0:58:4,8 --> 0:58:5,88
Here, Pete, I need to see.


870
0:58:5,88 --> 0:58:8,12
Here, show me.
Fuck. Doesn't look good, mate.


871
0:58:8,12 --> 0:58:16,32
I can't see.
There it is. You got it.


872
0:58:16,32 --> 0:58:20,56
Just there, yeah.


873
0:58:20,56 --> 0:58:23,6
Sorry, you right?


874
0:58:23,6 --> 0:58:26,24
I'll be fine, yeah.
Right, buddy?


875
0:58:26,24 --> 0:58:35,48
Thanks, though. Thanks.


876
0:58:35,48 --> 0:58:38,52
You guys ready to move soon?
We can't stay.


877
0:58:38,52 --> 0:58:40,28
I just need a minute. Hang on.


878
0:58:40,28 --> 0:58:44,32
What if that thing comes back?


879
0:58:44,32 --> 0:58:46,32
I don't know.


880
0:58:46,32 --> 0:58:52,56
Could we take it?
I doubt it.


881
0:58:52,56 --> 0:59:9,92
Only thing we've got to worry
about now is getting out of here.


882
0:59:9,92 --> 0:59:14,52
Hey, guys, I think it's gone.


883
0:59:14,52 --> 0:59:17,8
Right, let's get moving.


884
0:59:17,8 --> 0:59:19,68
Steve?
Yeah?


885
0:59:19,68 --> 0:59:22,4
You right, mate?
Yeah, mate. Yeah, I'm good.


886
0:59:22,4 --> 0:59:24,36
Let's go.
Just keep it quiet.


887
0:59:24,36 --> 0:59:31,16
Give me the camera.


888
0:59:31,16 --> 0:59:33,96
Just keep it quiet, OK?


889
0:59:33,96 --> 0:59:38,4
OK, let's go.


890
0:59:38,4 --> 0:59:41,8
Stay close.


891
0:59:41,8 --> 0:59:50,36
Through here.


892
0:59:50,36 --> 0:59:53,28
OK.


893
0:59:53,28 --> 0:59:55,84
Just hold on, hold on, hold on.


894
0:59:55,84 --> 0:59:57,32
OK.


895
0:59:57,32 --> 1:0:0,28
Oh, fuck.


896
1:0:0,28 --> 1:0:2,88
Pete...
Shit!


897
1:0:2,88 --> 1:0:5,8
This wasn't here before.
Pete.


898
1:0:5,8 --> 1:0:8,44
What are you doing?
It's not on the map.


899
1:0:8,44 --> 1:0:10,36
What do you mean
it's not on the map?


900
1:0:10,36 --> 1:0:13,96
It's only got one way.
This has got two.


901
1:0:13,96 --> 1:0:15,56
Pete, you've got to
figure it out, OK?


902
1:0:15,56 --> 1:0:17,92
Just chill the fuck out.
It's not easy, alright?


903
1:0:17,92 --> 1:0:19,4
You've got to fix this.


904
1:0:19,4 --> 1:0:21,64
Just shut the fuck up
and let me get through it.


905
1:0:21,64 --> 1:0:24,8
Nat, calm down, Nat.


906
1:0:24,8 --> 1:0:27,32
It's through here. We came back
through there. It's through here.


907
1:0:27,32 --> 1:0:31,16
OK, what if it's not
the right way, mate?


908
1:0:31,16 --> 1:0:36,96
Well, then... we find the safest room
and we wait it out.


909
1:0:36,96 --> 1:0:38,44
Oh, yeah, that's a good plan.


910
1:0:38,44 --> 1:0:40,24
John will figure out
that we haven't called


911
1:0:40,24 --> 1:0:43,0
and he'll send someone
down to find us.


912
1:0:43,0 --> 1:0:48,84
John knows we're here, right?


913
1:0:48,84 --> 1:0:50,28
Nat...


914
1:0:50,28 --> 1:0:56,24
Fucking tell me John
knows we're here.


915
1:0:56,24 --> 1:0:59,16
Oh, you're fucking kidding me.


916
1:0:59,16 --> 1:1:1,72
I can't...
Are you fucking serious?


917
1:1:1,72 --> 1:1:4,36
I... I needed you guys, OK?
I knew it!


918
1:1:4,36 --> 1:1:5,84
I needed you guys in this.


919
1:1:5,84 --> 1:1:7,32
You need us?
Yeah.


920
1:1:7,32 --> 1:1:9,52
We just lost a friend.


921
1:1:9,52 --> 1:1:13,32
You still need your fucking story?


922
1:1:13,32 --> 1:1:14,32
No.
Huh?


923
1:1:14,32 --> 1:1:15,8
Fuck you.


924
1:1:15,8 --> 1:1:17,8
Fuck you.
Keep you voice down.


925
1:1:17,8 --> 1:1:19,32
You think you're a fucking journalist.
Shh!


926
1:1:19,32 --> 1:1:21,32
We came down here
to get a story, didn't we?


927
1:1:21,32 --> 1:1:23,32
And now we've got an important one,


928
1:1:23,32 --> 1:1:25,2
and you're fucking
running scared!


929
1:1:25,2 --> 1:1:28,8
Shhh!


930
1:1:28,8 --> 1:1:32,52
Here's your fucking story.


931
1:1:32,52 --> 1:1:35,88
Here, you want your
piece to camera?


932
1:1:35,88 --> 1:1:38,52
Come on. Let's go.


933
1:1:38,52 --> 1:1:40,56
What's your piece to camera
for this one, huh?


934
1:1:40,56 --> 1:1:42,96
Do you want to tell us how...
how you lost your friend


935
1:1:42,96 --> 1:1:44,52
because of your fucking stupidity?


936
1:1:44,52 --> 1:1:46,4
Come on.
Waiting.


937
1:1:46,4 --> 1:1:48,72
Fuck you.
Come on, Nat.


938
1:1:48,72 --> 1:1:50,2
Come on.


939
1:1:50,2 --> 1:1:52,8
The best journalists
can work under any pressure,


940
1:1:52,8 --> 1:1:54,88
any sort of circumstance, come on.


941
1:1:54,88 --> 1:1:56,96
See, you can't say shit, can you?


942
1:1:56,96 --> 1:1:58,44
You know why?


943
1:1:58,44 --> 1:2:4,44
Because you're not there, Nat.


944
1:2:4,44 --> 1:2:9,6
You're just not there.


945
1:2:9,6 --> 1:2:15,84
You're fucking pathetic.


946
1:2:15,84 --> 1:2:18,6
Here. Through here.
Yeah.


947
1:2:18,6 --> 1:2:19,84
Oh, shit.


948
1:2:19,84 --> 1:2:23,4
Listen.
Shh!


949
1:2:23,4 --> 1:2:32,76
What the fuck...?


950
1:2:32,76 --> 1:2:34,24
What?
Shh.


951
1:2:34,24 --> 1:2:36,2
What is it?


952
1:2:36,2 --> 1:2:37,68
Hear that?


953
1:2:37,68 --> 1:2:42,92
Through here.


954
1:2:42,92 --> 1:2:46,84
Kill the light.


955
1:2:46,84 --> 1:2:54,56
Shh!


956
1:2:54,56 --> 1:2:57,88
Open the door, Nat.


957
1:2:57,88 --> 1:2:59,92
Open it up. Open it up.


958
1:2:59,92 --> 1:3:11,24
Guys, the lake's just here.


959
1:3:11,24 --> 1:3:31,2
Fuck!
Shh!


960
1:3:31,2 --> 1:3:47,64
Let me see, let me see.


961
1:3:47,64 --> 1:3:49,76
Is it Tangles, mate?
Shh, shh.


962
1:3:49,76 --> 1:3:51,28
What is it?
It's not Tangles.


963
1:3:51,28 --> 1:3:54,88
What's happened to his face?
Oh, Jesus.


964
1:3:54,88 --> 1:3:59,6
It's his eyes. Oh, Jesus.


965
1:3:59,6 --> 1:4:1,68
What's happening?


966
1:4:1,68 --> 1:4:3,16
We've got to help him.


967
1:4:3,16 --> 1:4:4,96
Let me see.


968
1:4:4,96 --> 1:4:56,0
Shh.


969
1:4:56,0 --> 1:5:1,36
Shh!


970
1:5:1,36 --> 1:5:12,52
Oh, fuck. It's seen us.


971
1:5:12,52 --> 1:5:15,84
We got to go, come on, come on!
Come on, let's go!


972
1:5:15,84 --> 1:5:18,24
Steve!


973
1:5:18,24 --> 1:5:22,4
Fuck! Let's go. Ah!


974
1:5:22,4 --> 1:5:24,48
Go, go, GO!
Just move it!


975
1:5:24,48 --> 1:5:26,2
Jesus. Which way? Which way?


976
1:5:26,2 --> 1:5:27,88
This way?
Go! Go now!


977
1:5:27,88 --> 1:5:30,2
Where? Where?
Here, here, here. Through here!


978
1:5:30,2 --> 1:5:31,72
Steve!
Go!


979
1:5:31,72 --> 1:5:34,64
Come on! Keep moving!


980
1:5:34,64 --> 1:5:38,52
Steve! Is he still behind us?


981
1:5:38,52 --> 1:5:40,12
I think we lost him!
You sure?


982
1:5:40,12 --> 1:5:42,52
I think so!
Shit.


983
1:5:42,52 --> 1:5:46,44
I think we lost it!


984
1:5:46,44 --> 1:5:48,72
I don't... I don't think it followed us.


985
1:5:48,72 --> 1:5:51,48
In here. There's a light in here.
Here, here.


986
1:5:51,48 --> 1:5:53,28
There.


987
1:5:53,28 --> 1:5:58,56
What's that?
I think it's the Cross City Tunnel.


988
1:5:58,56 --> 1:6:0,88
Hello?
This is a bad place to stop.


989
1:6:0,88 --> 1:6:2,36
No, it's fucking pointless.


990
1:6:2,36 --> 1:6:5,6
Hello?!
Shit, Pete.


991
1:6:5,6 --> 1:6:6,6
Shh!


992
1:6:6,6 --> 1:6:12,44
Hello! Hello!
Shh! Shh!


993
1:6:12,44 --> 1:6:14,6
You've got to keep it down.


994
1:6:14,6 --> 1:6:16,28
There's no-one there,
there's no-one there.


995
1:6:16,28 --> 1:6:20,56
Please, someone... help. Hello!
Shh, shh.


996
1:6:20,56 --> 1:6:23,76
Hello! Help!


997
1:6:23,76 --> 1:6:26,48
Help!
Shh! Nat, please. Let go. Please.


998
1:6:26,48 --> 1:6:27,96
You have to be quiet!
Help!


999
1:6:27,96 --> 1:6:30,68
Shh!


1000
1:6:30,68 --> 1:6:32,92
Shh! Nat, Nat, Nat.


1001
1:6:32,92 --> 1:6:35,8
Hey, you guys.
Help!


1002
1:6:35,8 --> 1:6:37,4
You've gotta keep your voice down.


1003
1:6:37,4 --> 1:6:40,12
Shhh!


1004
1:6:40,12 --> 1:6:47,12
Shut her up.


1005
1:6:47,12 --> 1:6:56,28
Shh. Shh.


1006
1:6:56,28 --> 1:7:0,36
You get anything?
Can you see anything?


1007
1:7:0,36 --> 1:7:4,16
Chuck the light.
Chuck the light over there.


1008
1:7:4,16 --> 1:7:9,28
Nuh.


1009
1:7:9,28 --> 1:7:11,48
It's alright.
I'm sorry.


1010
1:7:11,48 --> 1:7:13,64
Hey?
I'm sorry.


1011
1:7:13,64 --> 1:7:21,56
It's alright, don't be sorry.


1012
1:7:21,56 --> 1:7:24,6
I'm sorry. I'm sorry!
Shh.


1013
1:7:24,6 --> 1:7:30,68
It's OK, shh. Shh.


1014
1:7:30,68 --> 1:7:32,76
Everything was unravelling.


1015
1:7:32,76 --> 1:7:38,36
It... it was because of me.


1016
1:7:38,36 --> 1:7:44,8
I never meant for things
to get so out of hand.


1017
1:7:44,8 --> 1:7:48,92
Well, I didn't mean to let
Pete down. I mean, I...


1018
1:7:48,92 --> 1:7:51,76
I had thought I'd made
the right choice at the time


1019
1:7:51,76 --> 1:8:13,72
and I didn't mean to let him down.


1020
1:8:13,72 --> 1:8:17,52
Steve, through here.
Quick, quick. Come on, move it, mate.


1021
1:8:17,52 --> 1:8:24,72
Up here.


1022
1:8:24,72 --> 1:8:29,28
Nat. Up.


1023
1:8:29,28 --> 1:8:32,4
Come on. Shh!


1024
1:8:32,4 --> 1:8:39,84
Here, Nat, take this.


1025
1:8:39,84 --> 1:8:45,84
Ohhh!


1026
1:8:45,84 --> 1:8:47,96
Mate, get up! Come on!
Ugh!


1027
1:8:47,96 --> 1:8:50,6
You know, my natural instinct
was to turn around with the light,


1028
1:8:50,6 --> 1:8:52,8
see what was going on.


1029
1:8:52,8 --> 1:8:54,96
We'd just heard this sound,
Pete yelling out, and, uh,


1030
1:8:54,96 --> 1:8:57,6
as soon as they sort of fell
into the pool of light


1031
1:8:57,6 --> 1:9:1,12
the thing just... disappeared --
upped and left --


1032
1:9:1,12 --> 1:9:3,4
and that sort of
dawned on me then


1033
1:9:3,4 --> 1:9:9,32
that the light was our way
of keeping it away from us.


1034
1:9:9,32 --> 1:9:11,84
Shit. Are you OK? You OK?
Come on!


1035
1:9:11,84 --> 1:9:15,64
Fuck! Did you see that?


1036
1:9:15,64 --> 1:9:22,2
It took off.
Let's get out of here. Let's go.


1037
1:9:22,2 --> 1:9:25,56
It didn't like the light.
Well, keep it on, then.


1038
1:9:25,56 --> 1:9:29,4
Hold on. Nat.


1039
1:9:29,4 --> 1:9:31,8
Nat!


1040
1:9:31,8 --> 1:9:34,24
Ah!
No!


1041
1:9:34,24 --> 1:9:35,36
Come on, come on!


1042
1:9:35,36 --> 1:9:38,0
Come on, you fucker!
Pete! Pete, don't.


1043
1:9:38,0 --> 1:9:40,12
Come on! Come on!
Go! Come on!


1044
1:9:40,12 --> 1:9:42,2
It was almost like it was


1045
1:9:42,2 --> 1:9:47,32
trying to get us in a position
where it could get to us as well.


1046
1:9:47,32 --> 1:9:52,6
It reminded me of a lion trying to
cut one animal out of a pack, a herd.


1047
1:9:52,6 --> 1:10:0,12
You know, get the weak one out,
easy to attack.


1048
1:10:0,12 --> 1:10:3,88
Ah! Oh, fuck! Fuck.
We're losing the light!


1049
1:10:3,88 --> 1:10:5,88
Oh, fuck!
- Steve!


1050
1:10:5,88 --> 1:10:9,44
Oh, shit!
Back, back, back!


1051
1:10:9,44 --> 1:10:16,2
BACK! Fuck!


1052
1:10:16,2 --> 1:10:25,52
Go through.


1053
1:10:25,52 --> 1:10:27,76
What's the matter?


1054
1:10:27,76 --> 1:10:32,4
No, it's a dead end. It's a dead end.


1055
1:10:32,4 --> 1:10:34,52
Jesus. Oh, Jesus.


1056
1:10:34,52 --> 1:10:38,16
I thought that was it --
it was over.


1057
1:10:38,16 --> 1:10:43,8
There was nowhere left to run.


1058
1:10:43,8 --> 1:10:48,12
Then I saw this tiny bit of wall
that looked like it had broken away.


1059
1:10:48,12 --> 1:10:50,2
Pete, take this, take this.


1060
1:10:50,2 --> 1:10:52,8
Take it!


1061
1:10:52,8 --> 1:10:54,48
Oh, shit!


1062
1:10:54,48 --> 1:10:56,28
Give her a hand, Pete. Get in there.


1063
1:10:56,28 --> 1:10:59,16
Hold the light still.


1064
1:10:59,16 --> 1:11:4,4
Easy, Nat.
Shh, keep it down. Keep it down.


1065
1:11:4,4 --> 1:11:6,28
Keep it down.


1066
1:11:6,28 --> 1:11:9,4
Here, come through, Steve.


1067
1:11:9,4 --> 1:11:10,52
Huh?
Come through.


1068
1:11:10,52 --> 1:11:12,72
Go, go, go.
Go on, you go first.


1069
1:11:12,72 --> 1:11:14,2
Come on, Nat.


1070
1:11:14,2 --> 1:11:15,96
Good girl.


1071
1:11:15,96 --> 1:11:19,4
Here, take this -- quick.


1072
1:11:19,4 --> 1:11:23,48
Here, Nat.
OK.


1073
1:11:23,48 --> 1:12:9,84
Shh, shh, keep it down. Shh!


1074
1:12:9,84 --> 1:12:11,32
This isn't good.


1075
1:12:11,32 --> 1:12:14,0
Steve.


1076
1:12:14,0 --> 1:12:18,0
Steve, is that...? God.


1077
1:12:18,0 --> 1:12:20,92
This isn't good.


1078
1:12:20,92 --> 1:12:23,64
Steve.
Yeah?


1079
1:12:23,64 --> 1:12:26,84
We've got to go.


1080
1:12:26,84 --> 1:12:28,32
Fuck!


1081
1:12:28,32 --> 1:12:30,16
Light, mate, light.
Sorry.


1082
1:12:30,16 --> 1:12:31,96
It's gone.
Batteries.


1083
1:12:31,96 --> 1:12:32,96
Steve...


1084
1:12:32,96 --> 1:12:39,56
Fuck, I need some light over here.
Quick, Nat, light.


1085
1:12:39,56 --> 1:12:51,28
Nat, the fucking light, Nat. Fuck!
Give me the torch.


1086
1:12:51,28 --> 1:12:52,92
Oh, shit! That one's dead.


1087
1:12:52,92 --> 1:12:55,24
Oh, Jesus.
There's only one left.


1088
1:12:55,24 --> 1:12:58,72
Come on. Come on,
come on, come on.


1089
1:12:58,72 --> 1:13:1,52
Steve, we need that light.


1090
1:13:1,52 --> 1:13:4,84
We need the fucking light.
Steve, I need the fucking light!


1091
1:13:4,84 --> 1:13:7,32
Come on!


1092
1:13:7,32 --> 1:13:9,84
OK.


1093
1:13:9,84 --> 1:13:14,72
Oh, Jesus.


1094
1:13:14,72 --> 1:13:21,4
OK, now...


1095
1:13:21,4 --> 1:17:38,92
RUN!


1096
1:17:38,92 --> 1:17:46,0
Steve.


1097
1:17:46,0 --> 1:17:48,0
Steve. OK, OK.


1098
1:17:48,0 --> 1:17:49,96
Steve.


1099
1:17:49,96 --> 1:17:54,6
Come on. It's going for her.
It's going for her.


1100
1:17:54,6 --> 1:17:56,56
We've got to go.


1101
1:17:56,56 --> 1:18:56,44
Come on. Come on.


1102
1:18:56,44 --> 1:19:0,32
Nat!
Nat!


1103
1:19:0,32 --> 1:19:3,68
Let her go!
Let her go, you fucker!


1104
1:19:3,68 --> 1:19:7,4
Nat!


1105
1:19:7,4 --> 1:19:9,72
Take her. Take her!
OK.


1106
1:19:9,72 --> 1:19:15,32
Go. Just go!
Come on, Nat. Alright, let's go.


1107
1:19:15,32 --> 1:19:19,2
Oh, shit. Come on.
- Come on!


1108
1:19:19,2 --> 1:19:27,12
Come on, you fucker!


1109
1:19:27,12 --> 1:19:29,2
Come on, Nat.


1110
1:19:29,2 --> 1:19:30,68
Come on, let's move!


1111
1:19:30,68 --> 1:19:33,24
No...
Move!


1112
1:19:33,24 --> 1:19:35,68
No.
Come on.


1113
1:19:35,68 --> 1:19:38,2
Come on.


1114
1:19:38,2 --> 1:19:40,48
Wait!
Come on.


1115
1:19:40,48 --> 1:19:42,4
But Pete...
Come on!


1116
1:19:42,4 --> 1:19:44,44
No. Steve, we can't leave.
Come on!


1117
1:19:44,44 --> 1:19:46,8
We got...


1118
1:19:46,8 --> 1:19:49,8
Nat, keep moving.
Keep moving!


1119
1:19:49,8 --> 1:19:51,36
No.
We've got to keep
moving!


1120
1:19:51,36 --> 1:19:54,0
You can't leave Pete.
We can't! We've got to go!


1121
1:19:54,0 --> 1:19:56,48
Come on, Nat.
We've got to keep moving.


1122
1:19:56,48 --> 1:19:59,76
I think that
Pete was looking out for us


1123
1:19:59,76 --> 1:20:4,84
and I didn't want to leave him there.


1124
1:20:4,84 --> 1:20:8,8
Come on! Come on.


1125
1:20:8,8 --> 1:20:11,16
Pete wanted us to be safe --
I understand that.


1126
1:20:11,16 --> 1:20:13,84
But I didn't...
I didn't want to leave Pete behind.


1127
1:20:13,84 --> 1:20:15,72
Come on.


1128
1:20:15,72 --> 1:20:18,2
Come on. Come on.
- Guys!


1129
1:20:18,2 --> 1:20:20,6
Guys!


1130
1:20:20,6 --> 1:20:25,56
Shit!
Guys!


1131
1:20:25,56 --> 1:20:29,44
Oh, fuck. It's Pete. Fuck.


1132
1:20:29,44 --> 1:20:31,8
Come on, man!


1133
1:20:31,8 --> 1:20:34,0
When I heard Pete's voice


1134
1:20:34,0 --> 1:20:38,64
coming down that tunnel,
out of the darkness, uh...


1135
1:20:38,64 --> 1:20:44,52
I mean, I wasn't expecting
to hear his voice again.


1136
1:20:44,52 --> 1:20:46,36
Pete, no...
I can't...


1137
1:20:46,36 --> 1:20:48,28
No...


1138
1:20:48,28 --> 1:21:9,92
Let's go.


1139
1:21:9,92 --> 1:21:14,72
Let's go!


1140
1:21:14,72 --> 1:21:27,76
- No, Pete...
- Nat!


1141
1:21:27,76 --> 1:21:31,76
Pete, are you OK? Stay with me.
Help! Get some help! Someone!


1142
1:21:31,76 --> 1:21:38,4
I need a phone! I need a phone!
Give me a phone! Give me a phone!


1143
1:21:38,4 --> 1:21:42,48
Hey.


1144
1:21:42,48 --> 1:21:44,56
Hello. Police, fire or ambulance?


1145
1:21:44,56 --> 1:21:46,24
Hello?
Yes. Hello?


1146
1:21:46,24 --> 1:21:49,8
Do you need police, fire or ambulance?
Hello!


1147
1:21:49,8 --> 1:21:50,56
Help! We need help, we need help!


1148
1:21:50,56 --> 1:21:52,56
OK, miss, we'll get you some help.
What's happened?


1149
1:21:52,56 --> 1:21:54,96
We're on platform one.
We're in the station.


1150
1:21:54,96 --> 1:21:58,52
Please, you gotta get
someone here now.


1151
1:21:58,52 --> 1:22:3,96
My friend is dying. He's bleeding.
Please calm down, miss.


1152
1:22:3,96 --> 1:22:7,4
I need you to tell me exactly
where you are and what's happening.


1153
1:22:7,4 --> 1:22:9,56
I don't know -- we're in the station


1154
1:22:9,56 --> 1:22:12,84
and something...
something took our friend.


1155
1:22:12,84 --> 1:22:16,16
OK, please stay calm.
You said you're at the station?


1156
1:22:16,16 --> 1:22:19,92
Which station are you at?
Help me! Somebody HELP me!


1157
1:22:19,92 --> 1:22:21,52
What are you doing?!


1158
1:22:21,52 --> 1:22:26,16
Hello? Hello?


1159
1:22:26,16 --> 1:22:30,4
Hello? Are you there?


1160
1:22:30,4 --> 1:22:39,76
Hello?


1161
1:22:39,76 --> 1:22:48,52
Pete... Hey, Pete.


1162
1:22:48,52 --> 1:22:56,0
Pete...


1163
1:22:56,0 --> 1:23:6,68
I'm sorry... Pete! PETE!


1164
1:23:6,68 --> 1:23:12,44
Yeah, it's kind of hard to...
to talk about it now.


1165
1:23:12,44 --> 1:23:14,44
But I didn't know
he was dying at that point.


1166
1:23:14,44 --> 1:23:17,56
You know, I thought
we were all gonna be fine.


1167
1:23:17,56 --> 1:23:19,24
I mean...


1168
1:23:19,24 --> 1:23:23,64
..it had been so difficult to get
to that point where we got there,


1169
1:23:23,64 --> 1:23:26,12
and then, you know, I thought
we were going to be OK.


1170
1:23:26,12 --> 1:23:29,92
There was people around us,
there was light.


1171
1:23:29,92 --> 1:23:32,88
I... you know... I would
have been doing more


1172
1:23:32,88 --> 1:23:40,56
if I thought he was lying there dying.


1173
1:23:40,56 --> 1:23:45,52
I... I feel that I could have
done more to help Pete.


1174
1:23:45,52 --> 1:23:49,8
You know, it's, um... it's easy to say


1175
1:23:49,8 --> 1:23:55,44
that you would do things differently,
you know.


1176
1:23:55,44 --> 1:24:1,12
It just didn't seem... very fair.


1177
1:24:1,12 --> 1:24:3,64
I got told by the first paramedics


1178
1:24:3,64 --> 1:24:8,44
that, you know...
they'd sort of given up working on him,


1179
1:24:8,44 --> 1:24:14,84
they sort of... you know...
took a while to get Nat away from him.


1180
1:24:14,84 --> 1:24:18,32
And, uh,
it slowly, slowly dawned on me


1181
1:24:18,32 --> 1:24:20,6
about that point, you know.


1182
1:24:20,6 --> 1:24:22,16
They sort of walked away from him.


1183
1:24:22,16 --> 1:24:24,0
He was just lying there,
and he wasn't moving,


1184
1:24:24,0 --> 1:24:29,8
and I was... I just thought, "Fuck."


1185
1:24:29,8 --> 1:24:33,68
I feel... I feel... I feel responsible.


1186
1:24:33,68 --> 1:25:4,92
I don't want to say that
I felt like it was my fault.


1187
1:25:4,92 --> 1:25:8,2
I don't know exactly how
I've changed since that night.


1188
1:25:8,2 --> 1:25:11,76
I can't help thinking
we were so close.


1189
1:25:11,76 --> 1:25:14,6
Help was right there.


1190
1:25:14,6 --> 1:25:18,56
I go over it again and again.


1191
1:25:18,56 --> 1:25:22,16
Just constantly.


1192
1:25:22,16 --> 1:25:40,24
What would I do differently?


1193
1:25:40,24 --> 1:25:45,2
I was just pissed off
with everyone, everything.


1194
1:25:45,2 --> 1:25:48,92
The government...


1195
1:25:48,92 --> 1:25:50,44
..the police...


1196
1:25:50,44 --> 1:25:53,8
I mean, how much
evidence do you want?


1197
1:25:53,8 --> 1:25:59,28
It's just sad now, thinking about it.
It's pointless.


1198
1:25:59,28 --> 1:27:59,28
It's just fucking sad.
