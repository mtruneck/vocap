1
0:0:0,12 --> 0:0:3,76
voters in arizona pass something out is
proposition one hundred and what it does


2
0:0:3,76 --> 0:0:5,36
is it would


3
0:0:5,36 --> 0:0:9,78
prevents uh... undocumented immigrants
for posting bail if they have done


4
0:0:9,78 --> 0:0:13,35
something violent and dangerous okay so
if they have committed a serious crime


5
0:0:13,35 --> 0:0:18,27
they are not able to post bail uh... and
one of the people who has felt the


6
0:0:18,27 --> 0:0:22,4
consequences of that uh... is one woman
by the name that i had this year at


7
0:0:22,4 --> 0:0:25,349
warez uh... in maricopa county


8
0:0:25,349 --> 0:0:28,789
now this account to assure show right so
these are guys who do heinous of all


9
0:0:28,789 --> 0:0:29,42
time


10
0:0:29,42 --> 0:0:32,12
now looking at other sensibly at its


11
0:0:32,12 --> 0:0:36,63
uh... the intend i'm sure the voters was
hailed as a dangerous criminal et cetera


12
0:0:36,63 --> 0:0:38,55
this applies to any felony


13
0:0:38,55 --> 0:0:41,999
including forgery it which is what this
woman was charged with


14
0:0:41,999 --> 0:0:43,82
even though as your about to find out


15
0:0:43,82 --> 0:0:47,48
there wasn't room or now she went to go
get passport for her thirteen-year-old


16
0:0:47,48 --> 0:0:51,289
daughter and in the process of doing so
and she was told that she needed to go


17
0:0:51,289 --> 0:0:53,0
to a satellite


18
0:0:53,0 --> 0:0:57,96
add location to get the passport which
he thought was a little strains


19
0:0:57,96 --> 0:1:2,11
therefore he started questioning her
about her i'd eat they started


20
0:1:2,11 --> 0:1:4,89
questioning her about her birth
certificate and immediately assume that


21
0:1:4,89 --> 0:1:6,49
she is an undocumented immigrant


22
0:1:6,49 --> 0:1:9,0
family issues within she's latina


23
0:1:9,0 --> 0:1:12,98
uh... once said she has spent some time
in mexico


24
0:1:12,98 --> 0:1:16,15
do we have to prove anything more on
that


25
0:1:16,15 --> 0:1:17,76
put her in jail


26
0:1:17,76 --> 0:1:20,21
for and a


27
0:1:20,21 --> 0:1:23,95
and part of the reason why she couldn't
post bell is because of this week


28
0:1:23,95 --> 0:1:27,6
detials la that was passed in arizona
what's important is that it is the


29
0:1:27,6 --> 0:1:30,56
reason is the reason and also she


30
0:1:30,56 --> 0:1:32,479

0:1:32,479 --> 0:1:34,429
it's too far in the united states


32
0:1:34,429 --> 0:1:39,31
they they didn't care are the prosecutor
in this situation didn't even check the


33
0:1:39,31 --> 0:1:43,799
long-form birth certificate right and
the judge who heard this case was like


34

35

40
0:2:3,58 --> 0:2:7,17
jail for four dash half months


41
0:2:7,17 --> 0:2:8,399
on based on


42
0:2:8,399 --> 0:2:9,409

43
0:2:9,409 --> 0:2:12,859
and just couldn't believe it just i
don't want she has impressed you did you


44
0:2:12,859 --> 0:2:13,869
look for


45
0:2:13,869 --> 0:2:16,15
is that i got a month for birth
certificate


46
0:2:16,15 --> 0:2:19,6
what the what those if you are in prison
for four everyone's four


47
0:2:19,6 --> 0:2:22,119
but that's what happens when you before
wists


48
0:2:22,119 --> 0:2:23,28
policy when you say


49
0:2:23,28 --> 0:2:26,87
i don't care if she's guilty or not
guilty i don't care if we've had the


50
0:2:26,87 --> 0:2:27,739
trial


51
0:2:27,739 --> 0:2:28,599
that's one thing


52
0:2:28,599 --> 0:2:31,37
to say hey you know what was really
trying to be completed your get tough


53
0:2:31,37 --> 0:2:32,769
sent straight


54
0:2:32,769 --> 0:2:36,9
but now all contraceptive so even if
you're too was good enough


55
0:2:36,9 --> 0:2:41,13
joe lieberman even in the u_s_ senate
propose a bill that if anybody to use


56
0:2:41,13 --> 0:2:42,599
your terrorism


57
0:2:42,599 --> 0:2:45,409
you immediately lose your citizenship


58
0:2:45,409 --> 0:2:48,0
but not if you could could you just if
you were to use


59
0:2:48,0 --> 0:2:51,28
right this is a kind of call for that
we've gotten the n_b_a_ national defense


60
0:2:51,28 --> 0:2:53,9
authorization act


61
0:2:53,9 --> 0:2:55,41
says that if the military to use your
being


62
0:2:55,41 --> 0:2:57,969
and as sociated force about data


63
0:2:57,969 --> 0:3:1,449
they can detain you in definitely
without a trial


64
0:3:1,449 --> 0:3:3,959
so always surprises happening as owner


65
0:3:3,959 --> 0:3:7,499
and so they said well you look in on
some what you're next on your father


66
0:3:7,499 --> 0:3:9,829
that called you a different first name


67
0:3:9,829 --> 0:3:11,479
which happens only


68
0:3:11,479 --> 0:3:15,179
millions of people you know that
different first there's a setup right


69
0:3:15,179 --> 0:3:19,299
i've got enough i'm suspicious of you
looked you look like you're a foreigner


70
0:3:19,299 --> 0:3:22,569
uh... let's put your ass and joanne not
even bothered to look up we were right


71
0:3:22,569 --> 0:3:26,56
or wrong can you on magic on the part of
their wages they honestly


72
0:3:26,56 --> 0:3:28,69
is is that women on the war power


73
0:3:28,69 --> 0:3:29,889
this is true


74
0:3:29,889 --> 0:3:32,359
is that they don't give a damn about us
man


75
0:3:32,359 --> 0:3:35,749
you think that if you're rich and
powerful usage over four and a half


76
0:3:35,749 --> 0:3:36,769
months


77
0:3:36,769 --> 0:3:42,349
million bankers ever seen for a half
minutes until about four ab months


78
0:3:42,349 --> 0:3:45,71
and after all that front again but if
you don't have any power


79
0:3:45,71 --> 0:3:47,19
yeah nobody gives a damn


80
0:3:47,19 --> 0:3:50,97
change filmmaker cartridge good maker
house things that they will undermine


81
0:3:50,97 --> 0:3:53,699
she has a fourteen year old daughter
that she couldn't take care of fraph


82
0:3:53,699 --> 0:3:55,65
four and a half months because she was


83
0:3:55,65 --> 0:3:58,889
uh... thrown in jail for something that
she didn't do right


84
0:3:58,889 --> 0:4:2,99
and also i want to go back to something
you said jake about arizona voters and


85
0:4:2,99 --> 0:4:6,79
how they probably thought aryan out
there by the criminals then he average


86
0:4:6,79 --> 0:4:7,989
and put them away without bail them out


87
0:4:7,989 --> 0:4:12,369
this is a very specific piece of uh...
this is a very specific proposition


88
0:4:12,369 --> 0:4:16,749
right where they said undocumented
immigrants do not get to post bail and


89
0:4:16,749 --> 0:4:20,29
i'm one hundred percent disagree with
what you said this was something that


90
0:4:20,29 --> 0:4:24,58
was targeted against undocumented
immigrants arizona has a history of


91
0:4:24,58 --> 0:4:29,21
discriminating against hispanics and
this is another piece of the i can say


92
0:4:29,21 --> 0:4:31,969
what is it considered legislation if
it's proposition it's another


93
0:4:31,969 --> 0:4:33,759
proposition that's eight


94
0:4:33,759 --> 0:4:38,349
at you know destroying families in
arizona if they're brown and i'm real


95
0:4:38,349 --> 0:4:42,139
and tired of it and i'm tired of making
excuses for people in arizona attack


96
0:4:42,139 --> 0:4:45,739
making excuses for conservatives in the
country people who want to discriminate


97
0:4:45,739 --> 0:4:46,93
against people of color


98
0:4:46,93 --> 0:4:48,52
that's what's happening in this state


99
0:4:48,52 --> 0:4:51,639
well done and uh... so it is true that
i'm at a summit on top of it


100
0:4:51,639 --> 0:4:53,229
which is that


101
0:4:53,229 --> 0:4:57,779
with dressing crazy is that okay you
want are you done document people right


102
0:4:57,779 --> 0:5:2,9
ok anyway might disagree with them when
i think that there's a better way to


103
0:5:2,9 --> 0:5:6,21
address that issue which is a real issue
itself right


104
0:5:6,21 --> 0:5:8,9
if u judge people guilty


105
0:5:8,9 --> 0:5:13,39
before there's even a trial you don't
even know what they're under outstanding


106
0:5:13,39 --> 0:5:15,4
she was perfectly documented


107
0:5:15,4 --> 0:5:19,34
and you think that white people get live
in the guide name robert johnson gets


108
0:5:19,34 --> 0:5:23,689
locked up for being on diamond look even
blood people even black i get slide them


109
0:5:23,689 --> 0:5:24,81
in arizona


110
0:5:24,81 --> 0:5:28,85
uh... because uh... they thought he was
on document now the my liable for other


111
0:5:28,85 --> 0:5:31,599
reasons that i a lot of over there is an


112
0:5:31,599 --> 0:5:34,28
obviously this specifically allows


113
0:5:34,28 --> 0:5:38,0
corrupt law enforcement to go after but
he does in america


114
0:5:38,0 --> 0:5:43,539
and the guy who ascended uh... the the
top of the detective locker but the


115
0:5:43,539 --> 0:5:44,32
first place


116
0:5:44,32 --> 0:5:47,55
he lied on the stand and said oh yeah i
have information


117
0:5:47,55 --> 0:5:49,68
that does she herd ever do


118
0:5:49,68 --> 0:5:54,55
though driving it is a forgery the
prosecution literally had one at the


119
0:5:54,55 --> 0:5:57,9
cabinet witness in this case right


120
0:5:57,9 --> 0:6:0,49
and that witness was one of the
investigators and he claimed that vital


121
0:6:0,49 --> 0:6:4,3
records which holds the purse
certificates in arizona claimed


122
0:6:4,3 --> 0:6:8,38
that they had canceled this woman's
birth certificate because of forgery


123
0:6:8,38 --> 0:6:11,99
that the document was completely
fabricated made up that it was not real


124
0:6:11,99 --> 0:6:17,57
however vinyl records justified said no
that's not the case at all he is lying


125
0:6:17,57 --> 0:6:21,18
the president again israel it always has
been it always will be


126
0:6:21,18 --> 0:6:22,629
i mean it's not really mobile hot


127
0:6:22,629 --> 0:6:25,9
can get away with lying on the stand
like that


128
0:6:25,9 --> 0:6:29,409
lying to the grand jury about i'm sure
though that for that line which is by


129
0:6:29,409 --> 0:6:32,29
the way it legal to do that on this for
testimony


130
0:6:32,29 --> 0:6:36,719
that you'll spend for a half months in
jail right near doubt but


131
0:6:36,719 --> 0:8:36,719
that's a good or arizona's a scary scary
place man especially if you're latino
