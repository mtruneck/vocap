###3 In many cases you start with the innovation, but it's not enough,
###6 you have to build something on top of that
###8 and that typically is the insight.
###10 That insight is how that innovation actually takes root,
###14 how it has impact, why it's meaningful.
###16 And I'd argue the type of entrepreneur that starts
###18 with the innovation usually is what I call an
###21 "innovation-based entrepreneur".
###23 But there is another typology of entrepreneurship,
###25 as a matter of fact that starts in a very different way.
###27 How many of you would start this way,
###29 start with the idea and then start to find a market for it?
###32 And maybe, okay, a lot of you are raising your hands.
###35 I think that's a typical modality, right?
###38 Ideas are inherently valuable,
###39 but ideas that are applied are invaluable.
###42 I would suggest that ideas that are left on your
###44 list that are not acted on are valueless.
###47 These are ideas that need to be released,
###50 make them available to society, don't leave them behind.
###53 I can't tell you and I bet some of you have been in that
###56 situation where some of the best ides you've had,
###59 you see someone else implement, you've that experience, right?
###62 You just let the world just pass you on by because
###65 you hadn't had the time to make it happen.
###67 Think about that leverage, the individuals who are doing two,
###69 three, four ideas at a time or working with teams of
###72 people to actually make these concepts available.
###75 You know, emulate them. Make that happen.
###79 The second piece is a game-changing solution.
###81 This is an ingredient that's really critical
###83 to high-performance entrepreneurship. What do I mean by that?
###86 Ultimately, as you look and this is a great illustration of all the things
###89 that are happening in the software and the web environment here,
###92 in the social media environment,
###93 and that it occurs to me that it's almost
###95 a daunting set of solutions, right?
###99 Which solutions are going to actually make their way through?
###102 You know, many of these started with, just like you started,
###104 an idea, but many of these solutions need
###107 to find their impact in the market.
###109 Only a few will make it through, right?
###111 There are certain applications,
###113 for instance, certain concepts that end up becoming platforms
###117 and then becoming kind of central to our lifestyles, right?
###121 It occurs to me when you look at your smartphone,
###123 for instance, how many of you have over 100 applications
###127 on your - apps on your iPhone now?
###129 Can I ask? More than 100 apps? Pretty common.
###131 How many do you use on a typical day?
###134 One, two, three, right, am I right?
###137 How many of you are developing apps, I'm just curious?
###139 How many of you are developing apps as we speak? Okay.
###143 What's it going to take to make yours a game-changing app?
###146 Think about it. What is it going to take to become a game-changer?
###150 That is what it's going to take.
###152 You've got to dial-in the notion of need,
###155 how ultimately is that need being satisfied,
###158 how is that pain ultimately being mitigated?
###163 I would argue that the intersection of opportunity
###164 and need is where the entrepreneur needs to live.
###167 Opportunity is the most exciting type of platform
###171 an entrepreneur lives in their life,
###172 but need ultimately crystallizes it. That's the acid test.
###178 I would argue that there's a class of entrepreneurs,
###180 you might be surprised by this, they don't start with an idea at all,
###183 they start maybe with the market try to understand
###185 what the problems are that we all face.
###187 As they're reading the blogs or as they're going through
###190 the web or as they're reading the newspaper,
###192 believe it or not, in the morning, they actually see compelling need.
###195 And on top of that, they define a real customer in their mind.
###199 They see a customer, I call that the beachhead.
###202 That need is critical. And I would argue that kind of entrepreneur
###205 is a marketplace entrepreneur.
###207 They don't start with the innovation,
###208 they start with the problem and then they
###210 acquire innovation to solve the problem.
###213 These are conjoined and they match.
###216 So, the market is my wisest teacher.
###219 Honestly, the market will tell you whether or not your idea is going
###222 to gain relevance because people will walk with their feet.
###225 The market is a beautiful crystallizing test,
###228 launch and learns where it's better than learn and launch,
###230 you know, I saw that Steve Blank was here,
###232 for instance, absolutely true,
###234 they're bringing the market into the equation much earlier.
###237 We'll hope it'd test your ideas to see if
###239 they actually will make their way through.
