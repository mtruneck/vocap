1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:1,14



2
0:0:1,14 --> 0:0:3,51
STEVE: Hey, it's the first day
of school and nothing says fun


3
0:0:3,51 --> 0:0:4,67
like science.


4
0:0:4,67 --> 0:0:4,97
HIGGINSWORTH: Psst.


5
0:0:4,97 --> 0:0:6,14
STEVE: I've got some really,
really cool--


6
0:0:6,14 --> 0:0:6,964
HIGGINSWORTH: Psst, Steve.


7
0:0:6,964 --> 0:0:7,79
STEVE: Be quiet.


8
0:0:7,79 --> 0:0:9,38
And I've got some really cool
activities you can do.


9
0:0:9,38 --> 0:0:10,98
You're just going to
find some stuff--


10
0:0:10,98 --> 0:0:12,45
Higginsworth, quiet.


11
0:0:12,45 --> 0:0:13,88
HIGGINSWORTH: What did you
get for number four?


12
0:0:13,88 --> 0:0:14,19
STEVE: Your name.


13
0:0:14,19 --> 0:0:15,35
Write your name.


14
0:0:15,35 --> 0:0:17,53
Gosh.


15
0:0:17,53 --> 0:0:19,31
So all you're going to
do is get some really


16
0:0:19,31 --> 0:0:20,27
cool stuff at home.


17
0:0:20,27 --> 0:0:21,315
I'll put the whole thing--


18
0:0:21,315 --> 0:0:22,56
HIGGINSWORTH: Psst.


19
0:0:22,56 --> 0:0:24,116
STEVE: I didn't want
to have to do this.


20
0:0:24,116 --> 0:0:27,4



21
0:0:27,4 --> 0:0:28,772
It's going to be a good year.


22
0:0:28,772 --> 0:0:32,21



23
0:0:32,21 --> 0:0:35,245
I'm Steve Spangler and I'm all
about making science fun.


24
0:0:35,245 --> 0:0:38,3
For the last 20 years, I've
been teaching ways to turn


25
0:0:38,3 --> 0:0:41,32
ordinary science experiments
into unforgettable learning


26
0:0:41,32 --> 0:0:42,33
experiences.


27
0:0:42,33 --> 0:0:44,96
I have an amazing team who will
do whatever it takes to


28
0:0:44,96 --> 0:0:47,46
affect the way people
think about science.


29
0:0:47,46 --> 0:0:51,4
And to do that, I live by one
motto: make it big, do it


30
0:0:51,4 --> 0:0:52,95
right, give it class.


31
0:0:52,95 --> 0:0:58,417



32
0:0:58,417 --> 0:1:1,1
Well, every year also starts
with great school supplies,


33
0:1:1,1 --> 0:1:3,91
and if you have a great mom like
I do, she stocks you up.


34
0:1:3,91 --> 0:1:10,0
So let me see, tape, pencil,
glue, pen, scissors.


35
0:1:10,0 --> 0:1:11,3
That's good.


36
0:1:11,3 --> 0:1:11,5
Straw?


37
0:1:11,5 --> 0:1:15,36
Why did she give me a straw?


38
0:1:15,36 --> 0:1:18,19
Higginsworth, Mom
gave me a straw.


39
0:1:18,19 --> 0:1:21,21
HIGGINSWORTH: It's for
the pitcher of water.


40
0:1:21,21 --> 0:1:24,13
STEVE: Pitcher of water?


41
0:1:24,13 --> 0:1:25,2
Oh, yeah.


42
0:1:25,2 --> 0:1:27,46
Put that on your desk.


43
0:1:27,46 --> 0:1:29,7
What are you writing?


44
0:1:29,7 --> 0:1:31,46
HIGGINSWORTH: Nothing.


45
0:1:31,46 --> 0:1:32,55
Hey, come on, Steve.


46
0:1:32,55 --> 0:1:34,33
STEVE: Do you like me.


47
0:1:34,33 --> 0:1:36,14
Yes, no, maybe?


48
0:1:36,14 --> 0:1:39,116
No, she doesn't like you.


49
0:1:39,116 --> 0:1:41,64
And my mom always packed
me a great lunch.


50
0:1:41,64 --> 0:1:43,95
Higgins, why do we have
to eat at our desks?


51
0:1:43,95 --> 0:1:45,32
HIGGINSWORTH: Because you
read my note out loud.


52
0:1:45,32 --> 0:1:49,8
TEACHER: Spangler, Higginsworth,
it's quiet time.


53
0:1:49,8 --> 0:1:50,33
STEVE: Sorry, Miss Jenkins.


54
0:1:50,33 --> 0:1:53,1



55
0:1:53,1 --> 0:1:55,27
Let's see what she got me.


56
0:1:55,27 --> 0:1:56,91
Moms are so awesome.


57
0:1:56,91 --> 0:1:57,55
Notes.


58
0:1:57,55 --> 0:1:57,91
HIGGINSWORTH: Steve?


59
0:1:57,91 --> 0:1:59,57
What's the note say?


60
0:1:59,57 --> 0:2:0,13
STEVE: It's from my mom.


61
0:2:0,13 --> 0:2:1,7
It says, have a great
first day of school.


62
0:2:1,7 --> 0:2:3,21
PS, stay away from Higginsworth,
he's trouble.


63
0:2:3,21 --> 0:2:6,25



64
0:2:6,25 --> 0:2:13,953
And, San Pellegrino, so
sparkling and refreshing.


65
0:2:13,953 --> 0:2:14,855
HIGGINSWORTH: Hey.


66
0:2:14,855 --> 0:2:15,76
STEVE: Hold that.


67
0:2:15,76 --> 0:2:16,38
I'll share it with you.


68
0:2:16,38 --> 0:2:16,99
HIGGINSWORTH: Come on.


69
0:2:16,99 --> 0:2:18,8
STEVE: What else?


70
0:2:18,8 --> 0:2:19,68
Peanut butter.


71
0:2:19,68 --> 0:2:21,73
When you want only
the best, Skippy.


72
0:2:21,73 --> 0:2:22,98
Take this, Higgins.


73
0:2:22,98 --> 0:2:25,87



74
0:2:25,87 --> 0:2:27,731
Who doesn't like cheese?


75
0:2:27,731 --> 0:2:30,37
Junior Mints, very refreshing.


76
0:2:30,37 --> 0:2:32,59
Stewed tomatoes,
Mexican style.


77
0:2:32,59 --> 0:2:37,1
Gnocchi, when all your friends
want to enjoy pasta, the pasta


78
0:2:37,1 --> 0:2:38,88
alternative.


79
0:2:38,88 --> 0:2:42,77
And a Slim Jim, spicy
but great.


80
0:2:42,77 --> 0:2:44,66
Tempeh for those people who
don't like to eat other


81
0:2:44,66 --> 0:2:45,28
carnivores.


82
0:2:45,28 --> 0:2:47,37
And who doesn't love Cholula?


83
0:2:47,37 --> 0:2:50,486
Cholula, the spicy alternative
to salsa.


84
0:2:50,486 --> 0:2:53,31
And for dessert, Fiji.


85
0:2:53,31 --> 0:2:54,98
Fa gee yogurt.


86
0:2:54,98 --> 0:2:56,6
Don't eat all the fruit.


87
0:2:56,6 --> 0:3:0,15
What the heck?


88
0:3:0,15 --> 0:3:1,25
Why another straw?


89
0:3:1,25 --> 0:3:3,96
HIGGINSWORTH: Psst, its
for the Cheese Whiz.


90
0:3:3,96 --> 0:3:6,968
STEVE: Cheese Whiz.


91
0:3:6,968 --> 0:3:9,378
Oh, I hate those.


92
0:3:9,378 --> 0:3:11,79
Yum.


93
0:3:11,79 --> 0:3:12,86
Higginsworth, look at this.


94
0:3:12,86 --> 0:3:14,76
I spelled something
inappropriate on the cal--


95
0:3:14,76 --> 0:3:16,66
TEACHER: Spangler!


96
0:3:16,66 --> 0:3:19,8
STEVE: Sorry, Miss Jenkins.


97
0:3:19,8 --> 0:3:21,635
Well, since Miss Jenkins said I
had to stay after school, it


98
0:3:21,635 --> 0:3:24,36
means that I can show you some
cool science experiments using


99
0:3:24,36 --> 0:3:25,9
only the stuff that Mom sent.


100
0:3:25,9 --> 0:3:27,8
We're going to need that
sandwich bag first.


101
0:3:27,8 --> 0:3:28,93
So grab a sandwich bag.


102
0:3:28,93 --> 0:3:32,33
And to the sandwich bag you're
going to add some water.


103
0:3:32,33 --> 0:3:34,45
Start by filling the plastic
bag with water,


104
0:3:34,45 --> 0:3:38,8
probably 3/4 full.


105
0:3:38,8 --> 0:3:39,4
Seal it up.


106
0:3:39,4 --> 0:3:40,57
And now we're going to
do the impossible


107
0:3:40,57 --> 0:3:42,68
with these sharp pencils.


108
0:3:42,68 --> 0:3:44,86
Now, normally if you were to
take a sharpened pencil and


109
0:3:44,86 --> 0:3:46,615
puncture a hole into a bag,
it would leak with


110
0:3:46,615 --> 0:3:47,58
no problem at all.


111
0:3:47,58 --> 0:3:49,44
But if you know something about
the science of this


112
0:3:49,44 --> 0:3:50,36
plastic bag--


113
0:3:50,36 --> 0:3:53,2
See, plastic bags are nothing
more than polymers.


114
0:3:53,2 --> 0:3:55,69
And a polymer is a long
chain of molecules.


115
0:3:55,69 --> 0:3:58,53
I want you to think of these
long strands of molecules


116
0:3:58,53 --> 0:4:1,22
almost like fibers that make
up the plastic bag.


117
0:4:1,22 --> 0:4:3,44
In this particular case, if
you take your sharpened


118
0:4:3,44 --> 0:4:5,65
pencil, and you just have to
believe it's going to work,


119
0:4:5,65 --> 0:4:8,97
and you push through, you
literally, can separate these


120
0:4:8,97 --> 0:4:11,79
long chains of molecules.


121
0:4:11,79 --> 0:4:14,6
The bag seals around the pencil
and hopefully, it


122
0:4:14,6 --> 0:4:17,39
doesn't leak.


123
0:4:17,39 --> 0:4:17,829
Bingo.


124
0:4:17,829 --> 0:4:19,18
That look great?


125
0:4:19,18 --> 0:4:21,88
So now the object is just to see
how many pencils you can


126
0:4:21,88 --> 0:4:22,63
get through.


127
0:4:22,63 --> 0:4:26,24
It's kind of like doing
sandwich bag surgery.


128
0:4:26,24 --> 0:4:28,32
You will get a couple leaks here
and there, but, for the


129
0:4:28,32 --> 0:4:31,91
most part, you can do this right
over a friend's head and


130
0:4:31,91 --> 0:4:32,81
they should be fine.


131
0:4:32,81 --> 0:4:36,4
Or for extra credit, do it right
over the teacher's head


132
0:4:36,4 --> 0:4:38,75
and they will love it.


133
0:4:38,75 --> 0:4:43,28
The only problem with this, the
waterproof bag, is pulling


134
0:4:43,28 --> 0:4:44,982
out the pencils.


135
0:4:44,982 --> 0:4:47,43
Higginsworth?


136
0:4:47,43 --> 0:4:50,62
He'll do anything.


137
0:4:50,62 --> 0:4:51,16
I've been doing this--


138
0:4:51,16 --> 0:4:52,58
TEACHER: Spangler!


139
0:4:52,58 --> 0:4:54,182
STEVE: Sorry, Miss Jenkins.


140
0:4:54,182 --> 0:4:56,34
You can do something very cool
if you have a ruler.


141
0:4:56,34 --> 0:5:0,96
You just need a regular ruler
and a sheet of newspaper.


142
0:5:0,96 --> 0:5:2,4
And some air.


143
0:5:2,4 --> 0:5:4,85
The object of this challenge
is to karate chop


144
0:5:4,85 --> 0:5:5,93
this ruler in half.


145
0:5:5,93 --> 0:5:7,65
I know, that's bad.


146
0:5:7,65 --> 0:5:9,18
But you can only use one hand.


147
0:5:9,18 --> 0:5:11,33
Now, if you just put the ruler
here like this and you karate


148
0:5:11,33 --> 0:5:13,69
chop it like this.


149
0:5:13,69 --> 0:5:15,16
It doesn't work.


150
0:5:15,16 --> 0:5:17,31
And that's where the sheet
of newspaper comes in.


151
0:5:17,31 --> 0:5:19,55
Believe it or not, we need this
flimsy little sheet of


152
0:5:19,55 --> 0:5:22,195
newspaper to hold the
ruler in place.


153
0:5:22,195 --> 0:5:23,59
It'll do it.


154
0:5:23,59 --> 0:5:25,77
The only change we're going to
make to the newspaper is to


155
0:5:25,77 --> 0:5:27,51
increase its surface area.


156
0:5:27,51 --> 0:5:30,64
See it's 506 square inches.


157
0:5:30,64 --> 0:5:34,77
If every square inch has air
pressure pushing on it and if


158
0:5:34,77 --> 0:5:38,42
we were at sea level, that would
be about 14.7 pounds per


159
0:5:38,42 --> 0:5:39,34
square inch.


160
0:5:39,34 --> 0:5:41,91
That means that on this sheet
of newspaper, if it was laid


161
0:5:41,91 --> 0:5:45,5
out completely flat, this sheet
of newspaper would have


162
0:5:45,5 --> 0:5:51,27
nearly 7,438 pounds of pressure
pushing on it.


163
0:5:51,27 --> 0:5:54,37
I think it's enough to hold
the ruler in place.


164
0:5:54,37 --> 0:5:54,93
Ready?


165
0:5:54,93 --> 0:5:59,65
Three, two, it's not exactly
about just the air pressure.


166
0:5:59,65 --> 0:6:2,41
Yes, there's air pushing down
on it, but if you'll notice,


167
0:6:2,41 --> 0:6:4,4
there's a little bit of air
sneaking underneath.


168
0:6:4,4 --> 0:6:6,2
So in theory, it's air.


169
0:6:6,2 --> 0:6:9,61
In reality, it's a combination
of the air pushing down on it


170
0:6:9,61 --> 0:6:13,5
and the drag, or what's going
to happen when it tries to


171
0:6:13,5 --> 0:6:15,24
flip back up again, and the
sheet of newspaper with the


172
0:6:15,24 --> 0:6:19,43
air pushing down kind of
holding it in place.


173
0:6:19,43 --> 0:6:22,55
Look at that.


174
0:6:22,55 --> 0:6:24,94
Right in half.


175
0:6:24,94 --> 0:6:26,816
That wasn't me, it
was the air.


176
0:6:26,816 --> 0:6:37,232



177
0:6:37,232 --> 0:6:39,86
You know, Mom said never
to play with your food.


178
0:6:39,86 --> 0:6:40,92
So did Miss Jenkins.


179
0:6:40,92 --> 0:6:43,42
But in this particular case,
it's a great idea because you


180
0:6:43,42 --> 0:6:45,69
could use this spoon
as a catapult.


181
0:6:45,69 --> 0:6:47,98
Now, there have been lots of
activities out there where you


182
0:6:47,98 --> 0:6:50,2
just simply take a spoon
and tape it down.


183
0:6:50,2 --> 0:6:52,68
We want more variables because
we want to turn this into a


184
0:6:52,68 --> 0:6:54,0
real science experiment.


185
0:6:54,0 --> 0:6:55,98
So this notebook will be perfect
because we're going to


186
0:6:55,98 --> 0:6:58,64
attach the spoon to the notebook
and allow this to be


187
0:6:58,64 --> 0:7:0,32
able to change the angle.


188
0:7:0,32 --> 0:7:2,24
And we can figure out how far
it's going to go and have a


189
0:7:2,24 --> 0:7:3,38
nice little hypothesis.


190
0:7:3,38 --> 0:7:6,13
And believe it or not, the
secret is the staple remover.


191
0:7:6,13 --> 0:7:10,49
Step one, attach the spoon to
the staple remover just using


192
0:7:10,49 --> 0:7:12,5
some of that tape.


193
0:7:12,5 --> 0:7:13,53
Perfect.


194
0:7:13,53 --> 0:7:18,43
Now we've got to attach that
contraption to the notebook.


195
0:7:18,43 --> 0:7:25,771



196
0:7:25,771 --> 0:7:28,69
This is perfect.


197
0:7:28,69 --> 0:7:31,649
Now we just need ammunition
and a target.


198
0:7:31,649 --> 0:7:32,899
Higginsworth.


199
0:7:32,899 --> 0:7:40,4



200
0:7:40,4 --> 0:7:41,53
HIGGINSWORTH: Knock it off.


201
0:7:41,53 --> 0:7:41,78
STEVE: Quiet.


202
0:7:41,78 --> 0:7:43,3
HIGGINSWORTH: Miss Jenkins.


203
0:7:43,3 --> 0:8:17,26



204
0:8:17,26 --> 0:8:18,51
STEVE: God, that hurt.


205
0:8:18,51 --> 0:10:18,51
