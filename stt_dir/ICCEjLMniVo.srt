0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:5,39



2
0:0:5,39 --> 0:0:8,42
VALERIE VARGAS: We
are around here.


3
0:0:8,42 --> 0:0:10,0
STEWART ROBSON: We're where
the big, red circle is.


4
0:0:10,0 --> 0:0:12,54
VALERIE VARGAS: We're in
the big, red circle.


5
0:0:12,54 --> 0:0:14,66
Did you see the kangaroos
in there?


6
0:0:14,66 --> 0:0:15,91
And the wallabies?


7
0:0:15,91 --> 0:0:20,2



8
0:0:20,2 --> 0:0:21,775
STEWART ROBSON: Hello.


9
0:0:21,775 --> 0:0:23,52
VALERIE VARGAS: How
cool is he?


10
0:0:23,52 --> 0:0:25,818
STEWART ROBSON: You want
to go on the slides?


11
0:0:25,818 --> 0:0:27,68
You know you do.


12
0:0:27,68 --> 0:0:32,958



13
0:0:32,958 --> 0:0:34,86
VALERIE VARGAS: Can you imagine
getting a hug from one


14
0:0:34,86 --> 0:0:37,26
of them, how awesome
that would feel?


15
0:0:37,26 --> 0:0:41,86
It would wrap around your
whole entire body.


16
0:0:41,86 --> 0:0:45,4
MALE SPEAKER:


17
0:0:45,4 --> 0:0:47,77
STEWART ROBSON: I can't really
remember, to be honest.


18
0:0:47,77 --> 0:0:49,7
She'd probably need
to jog my memory.


19
0:0:49,7 --> 0:0:52,92
MALE SPEAKER:


20
0:0:52,92 --> 0:0:54,32
STEWART ROBSON: Oh yeah.


21
0:0:54,32 --> 0:0:56,7
We were working together then.


22
0:0:56,7 --> 0:0:57,975
We were friends, and
we were whatever.


23
0:0:57,975 --> 0:1:2,2
And she was blind drunk.


24
0:1:2,2 --> 0:1:2,685
Horrendous.


25
0:1:2,685 --> 0:1:5,595
I remember telling her, if you
were a man, I'd knock you out.


26
0:1:5,595 --> 0:1:11,56
Because she's a mean drunk,
really horrible.


27
0:1:11,56 --> 0:1:13,865
And then, well why are
you being an asshole?


28
0:1:13,865 --> 0:1:18,126
And her answer was, I
fucking love you.


29
0:1:18,126 --> 0:1:19,75
A few months later,
we were together.


30
0:1:19,75 --> 0:1:35,846



31
0:1:35,846 --> 0:1:37,85
VALERIE VARGAS: The lion's
voice is the deepest and


32
0:1:37,85 --> 0:1:38,59
loudest of all cats.


33
0:1:38,59 --> 0:1:40,36
How low is your voice compared
to a lion's roar?


34
0:1:40,36 --> 0:1:44,25
Pop your head through the hole
and growl as low as you can.


35
0:1:44,25 --> 0:1:46,196
Go on.


36
0:1:46,196 --> 0:1:47,6
STEWART ROBSON: I'm
not going to roar.


37
0:1:47,6 --> 0:1:48,536
VALERIE VARGAS: Go on.


38
0:1:48,536 --> 0:1:50,408
STEWART ROBSON: Ahh.


39
0:1:50,408 --> 0:1:53,21
VALERIE VARGAS: We were friends
just before he started


40
0:1:53,21 --> 0:1:56,66
to be serious about wanting to
tattoo, and before he actually


41
0:1:56,66 --> 0:1:57,63
started tattooing.


42
0:1:57,63 --> 0:2:2,28
By then we were talking every
other day swapping stories


43
0:2:2,28 --> 0:2:4,76
about what's going on with me.


44
0:2:4,76 --> 0:2:6,16
And I really liked
his work online.


45
0:2:6,16 --> 0:2:9,7
He had a couple of websites
with some of his work.


46
0:2:9,7 --> 0:2:11,9
And it was like, hey, would you
mind just doing a little


47
0:2:11,9 --> 0:2:11,67
black tattoo?


48
0:2:11,67 --> 0:2:12,49
And he did it.


49
0:2:12,49 --> 0:2:14,5
And we just stayed in touch.


50
0:2:14,5 --> 0:2:17,46
So it was a lovely journey,
friendship wise.


51
0:2:17,46 --> 0:2:20,46
And then when we got together
it felt like, right, this is


52
0:2:20,46 --> 0:2:21,71
where it really begins now.


53
0:2:21,71 --> 0:2:24,79



54
0:2:24,79 --> 0:2:26,61
STEWART ROBSON: I absolutely
love the head, the tail--


55
0:2:26,61 --> 0:2:29,76



56
0:2:29,76 --> 0:2:30,8
yeah.


57
0:2:30,8 --> 0:2:31,44
VALERIE VARGAS: [INAUDIBLE]


58
0:2:31,44 --> 0:2:32,55
STEWART ROBSON: Yeah,
absolutely.


59
0:2:32,55 --> 0:2:35,28
Every element about it is just
more the position of where


60
0:2:35,28 --> 0:2:37,37
he's off to.


61
0:2:37,37 --> 0:2:38,78
VALERIE VARGAS: Well let
me draw it first.


62
0:2:38,78 --> 0:2:40,868
And then I'll let
you have a look.


63
0:2:40,868 --> 0:2:44,144



64
0:2:44,144 --> 0:2:46,2
STEWART ROBSON:


65
0:2:46,2 --> 0:2:47,67
VALERIE VARGAS: He doesn't like
the claws, the way the


66
0:2:47,67 --> 0:2:48,945
angle of them goes.


67
0:2:48,945 --> 0:3:0,0
STEWART ROBSON:


68
0:3:0,0 --> 0:3:2,34
VALERIE VARGAS: He's always been
very good at doing that,


69
0:3:2,34 --> 0:3:5,65
telling me why something is
wrong, not just telling me


70
0:3:5,65 --> 0:3:8,7
it's wrong or why does that
look like shit, you know.


71
0:3:8,7 --> 0:3:9,21
STEWART ROBSON: That's
how we ended up


72
0:3:9,21 --> 0:3:9,93
getting together, really.


73
0:3:9,93 --> 0:3:13,5
Because it worked really well.


74
0:3:13,5 --> 0:3:15,29
She helps me with drawings,
I help her with drawings.


75
0:3:15,29 --> 0:3:18,29
And she went, why is that tiger
you drew cross-eyed?


76
0:3:18,29 --> 0:3:20,595
And I'm like, I didn't fucking
notice it's cross-eyed.


77
0:3:20,595 --> 0:3:22,59
And so we can help each other.


78
0:3:22,59 --> 0:3:25,3
Maybe I focus more on
composition and flow, and she


79
0:3:25,3 --> 0:3:26,62
focuses more on detail.


80
0:3:26,62 --> 0:3:31,73
And Valerie can characterize
a mood and a feeling and a


81
0:3:31,73 --> 0:3:33,33
character in a tattoo.


82
0:3:33,33 --> 0:3:35,78
And a lot of people don't
make a character.


83
0:3:35,78 --> 0:3:38,52
They either make it angry or sad
or whatever, but there's


84
0:3:38,52 --> 0:3:40,48
no character there.


85
0:3:40,48 --> 0:3:41,45
She's known for faces.


86
0:3:41,45 --> 0:3:45,19
But she also does a
characterization with eagle,


87
0:3:45,19 --> 0:3:48,72
snakes, and narrowing an eye,
and maybe a larger pupil or a


88
0:3:48,72 --> 0:3:49,59
smaller pupil.


89
0:3:49,59 --> 0:3:52,76
And she understands
that stuff.


90
0:3:52,76 --> 0:3:55,7
VALERIE VARGAS: I'm just so
happy that I like his work, he


91
0:3:55,7 --> 0:3:58,28
likes my work, which means that
we have mutual respect.


92
0:3:58,28 --> 0:4:1,51
I've said to him before, kind
of jokingly, if you sucked I


93
0:4:1,51 --> 0:4:3,21
wouldn't have half as much
fun in this relationship


94
0:4:3,21 --> 0:4:4,78
as I do, you know?


95
0:4:4,78 --> 0:4:7,97
It's really cool to watch over
his shoulder and just be like,


96
0:4:7,97 --> 0:4:8,94
how did you do that?


97
0:4:8,94 --> 0:4:9,535
That's amazing.


98
0:4:9,535 --> 0:4:12,44
And I love it.


99
0:4:12,44 --> 0:4:15,48
STEWART ROBSON: I don't think
either of our work would be as


100
0:4:15,48 --> 0:4:17,81
accomplished without
each other.


101
0:4:17,81 --> 0:4:18,94
All right, Dragon Man.


102
0:4:18,94 --> 0:4:19,782
VALERIE VARGAS (OFFSCREEN):
The Dragon Man.


103
0:4:19,782 --> 0:4:22,56
STEWART ROBSON:


104
0:4:22,56 --> 0:4:24,895
VALERIE VARGAS (OFFSCREEN):
Shut the fuck up.


105
0:4:24,895 --> 0:4:26,54
It doesn't need a wave at all.


106
0:4:26,54 --> 0:4:26,74
STEWART ROBSON: It says,
[INAUDIBLE] in


107
0:4:26,74 --> 0:4:27,89
the water above it.


108
0:4:27,89 --> 0:4:28,78
VALERIE VARGAS (OFFSCREEN):
Ugh.


109
0:4:28,78 --> 0:4:30,13
Shut up.


110
0:4:30,13 --> 0:4:31,95
You're just making
my life harder.


111
0:4:31,95 --> 0:4:33,7
MALE SPEAKER: You're
not a fan of waves?


112
0:4:33,7 --> 0:4:37,22
VALERIE VARGAS: I can't draw
water to save my life.


113
0:4:37,22 --> 0:4:39,145
I'm generally quite a grumpy
sod, to be honest.


114
0:4:39,145 --> 0:4:40,84
You know, I don't know if it
comes through or what.


115
0:4:40,84 --> 0:4:44,58
But I think the more I hang out
with people the more they


116
0:4:44,58 --> 0:4:45,35
see it, definitely.


117
0:4:45,35 --> 0:4:48,73
STEWART ROBSON:


118
0:4:48,73 --> 0:4:49,133
VALERIE VARGAS (OFFSCREEN):
Where?


119
0:4:49,133 --> 0:4:49,94
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Where?


120
0:4:49,94 --> 0:4:52,4
VALERIE VARGAS (OFFSCREEN): If
you're going to say here, I


121
0:4:52,4 --> 0:4:52,935
don't want it there.


122
0:4:52,935 --> 0:4:54,85
STEWART ROBSON: No, no, because
that'll take up space.


123
0:4:54,85 --> 0:4:57,48
You need a cloud in here.


124
0:4:57,48 --> 0:4:57,923
VALERIE VARGAS: Really?


125
0:4:57,923 --> 0:4:59,39
STEWART ROBSON (OFFSCREEN):
Yeah, in that little bit.


126
0:4:59,39 --> 0:5:1,495
Because that's just an
empty hollow there.


127
0:5:1,495 --> 0:5:4,465
That's all.


128
0:5:4,465 --> 0:5:7,93



129
0:5:7,93 --> 0:5:8,516
VALERIE VARGAS (OFFSCREEN):
No, I'm not


130
0:5:8,516 --> 0:5:10,68
gonna do a cloud there.


131
0:5:10,68 --> 0:5:12,3
VALERIE VARGAS (OFFSCREEN):
See, Stewart?


132
0:5:12,3 --> 0:5:19,94
STEWART ROBSON (OFFSCREEN):


133
0:5:19,94 --> 0:5:22,21
DANTE DIMASSA: We all say that
Stewart's under the thumb.


134
0:5:22,21 --> 0:5:25,63
You know, I'm married, I have a
child, and the one who wears


135
0:5:25,63 --> 0:5:28,22
the pants in my house
is my wife.


136
0:5:28,22 --> 0:5:30,69
It might not look like that, but
that's how a man's life--


137
0:5:30,69 --> 0:5:32,556
not a man's life.


138
0:5:32,556 --> 0:5:35,17
You know, when you get married
you sign up for that.


139
0:5:35,17 --> 0:5:35,85
That's how it is.


140
0:5:35,85 --> 0:5:37,2
So it's all right.


141
0:5:37,2 --> 0:5:38,51
And Stewart knows that.


142
0:5:38,51 --> 0:5:40,27
Stewart knows how to
handle Valerie.


143
0:5:40,27 --> 0:5:44,21
STEFANO C: I mean, I
know many couples


144
0:5:44,21 --> 0:5:45,28
that are both tattooers.


145
0:5:45,28 --> 0:5:48,57
So there's always
the team work.


146
0:5:48,57 --> 0:5:50,61
And I guess it does help.


147
0:5:50,61 --> 0:5:54,61
I mean, having satisfaction from
work makes you go home


148
0:5:54,61 --> 0:6:0,81
and have a positive love
life or relationship.


149
0:6:0,81 --> 0:6:4,2
It's obviously a full-on
tattoo life.


150
0:6:4,2 --> 0:6:5,63
VALERIE VARGAS: You're going
to have to get a spider web


151
0:6:5,63 --> 0:6:6,88
for this one.


152
0:6:6,88 --> 0:6:9,26



153
0:6:9,26 --> 0:6:10,83
I think that would be nice.


154
0:6:10,83 --> 0:6:12,97
Either that, or get a spider
web, actually, on the ball of


155
0:6:12,97 --> 0:6:13,84
your shoulder.


156
0:6:13,84 --> 0:6:14,83
STEWART ROBSON: There's
not much outside of


157
0:6:14,83 --> 0:6:18,81
tattoos in our lives.


158
0:6:18,81 --> 0:6:21,81
And things have fallen by the
wayside that aren't tattoos,


159
0:6:21,81 --> 0:6:24,3
or that we can't soak
up information


160
0:6:24,3 --> 0:6:25,17
from to use in tattooing.


161
0:6:25,17 --> 0:6:27,22
But then, tattooing has
given us so much.


162
0:6:27,22 --> 0:6:29,56
Our relationship is due to
tattooing, our friends and the


163
0:6:29,56 --> 0:6:31,39
opportunities that arise.


164
0:6:31,39 --> 0:6:33,44
It's given us our lives,
and we enjoy our lives.


165
0:6:33,44 --> 0:6:35,7
So keep feeding the beast.


166
0:6:35,7 --> 0:6:54,16



167
0:6:54,16 --> 0:6:56,9
STEWART ROBSON (OFFSCREEN):
[INAUDIBLE] neck.


168
0:6:56,9 --> 0:6:57,36
VALERIE VARGAS (OFFSCREEN):
They always look


169
0:6:57,36 --> 0:6:58,61
like they're drunk.


170
0:6:58,61 --> 0:7:4,76



171
0:7:4,76 --> 0:7:6,22
STEWART ROBSON (OFFSCREEN):
He's pissed.


172
0:7:6,22 --> 0:7:8,54
He's not happy.


173
0:7:8,54 --> 0:7:9,79
VALERIE VARGAS: You think so?


174
0:7:9,79 --> 0:7:18,57



175
0:7:18,57 --> 0:7:19,33
Yeah?


176
0:7:19,33 --> 0:7:23,357
Green dragon, some purple,
some yellow, some red?


177
0:7:23,357 --> 0:7:27,253
MALE SPEAKER:


178
0:7:27,253 --> 0:7:27,74
VALERIE VARGAS (OFFSCREEN):
Really?


179
0:7:27,74 --> 0:7:29,201
Because I thought I'd draw
a peacock on you.


180
0:7:29,201 --> 0:7:34,558
MALE SPEAKER:


181
0:7:34,558 --> 0:7:35,5
VALERIE VARGAS (OFFSCREEN):
Oh, that's


182
0:7:35,5 --> 0:7:36,58
definitely not green.


183
0:7:36,58 --> 0:7:37,42
Oh, no, no.


184
0:7:37,42 --> 0:7:38,88
That's definitely
turquoise blue.


185
0:7:38,88 --> 0:7:40,13
That's not green.


186
0:7:40,13 --> 0:7:42,63



187
0:7:42,63 --> 0:7:44,42
Like that kind of green.


188
0:7:44,42 --> 0:7:45,88
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): OK.


189
0:7:45,88 --> 0:7:47,2
VALERIE VARGAS: Basically, since
I got into tattoos in


190
0:7:47,2 --> 0:7:50,39
2004 with my apprenticeship,
I've just not stopped.


191
0:7:50,39 --> 0:7:54,12
And I'm catching up now
with the fun stuff.


192
0:7:54,12 --> 0:7:57,97
And I keep reminding myself I'm
a 30-year-old woman, I'm


193
0:7:57,97 --> 0:7:59,53
not a 15-year-old girl.


194
0:7:59,53 --> 0:8:3,28
I need to learn to drive, I need
to learn to do things.


195
0:8:3,28 --> 0:8:5,315
I barely know how to cook.


196
0:8:5,315 --> 0:8:7,2
And he kind of jokes about
it, but he's very


197
0:8:7,2 --> 0:8:8,19
serious at the same time.


198
0:8:8,19 --> 0:8:10,56
Like look, when we finally
settle into this flat, I'm


199
0:8:10,56 --> 0:8:11,88
going to take you to the
supermarket, and I'm going to


200
0:8:11,88 --> 0:8:13,41
teach you how to shop
for food and stuff.


201
0:8:13,41 --> 0:8:14,95
Because I don't know how
to shop for food.


202
0:8:14,95 --> 0:8:16,62
I literally go, I want
a sandwich right


203
0:8:16,62 --> 0:8:18,18
now, I'll buy a sandwich.


204
0:8:18,18 --> 0:8:19,58
And then what do
I eat tomorrow?


205
0:8:19,58 --> 0:8:23,22
I'm really bad like that, so
he's going to help me a little


206
0:8:23,22 --> 0:8:25,84
bit, be a bit more
domesticated.


207
0:8:25,84 --> 0:8:29,43
That's a sexy fish.


208
0:8:29,43 --> 0:8:31,108
Would you not agree?


209
0:8:31,108 --> 0:8:32,46
STEWART ROBSON: A sexy fish?


210
0:8:32,46 --> 0:8:33,296
VALERIE VARGAS: Yeah.


211
0:8:33,296 --> 0:8:35,798



212
0:8:35,798 --> 0:8:36,82
Oh, look at that dude.


213
0:8:36,82 --> 0:8:38,7
How awesome is he?


214
0:8:38,7 --> 0:8:42,909



215
0:8:42,909 --> 0:8:44,205
STEWART ROBSON (OFFSCREEN):
It's just nice to grow


216
0:8:44,205 --> 0:8:45,9
alongside someone, as well.


217
0:8:45,9 --> 0:8:50,0
It's super cool.


218
0:8:50,0 --> 0:8:51,8
I guess we're still
growing together.


219
0:8:51,8 --> 0:8:52,85
She's still developing.


220
0:8:52,85 --> 0:8:53,86
It's really cool to see that.


221
0:8:53,86 --> 0:8:55,52
And I'm still developing,
and she's really


222
0:8:55,52 --> 0:8:57,666
supportive of that.


223
0:8:57,666 --> 0:8:58,57
Yeah.


224
0:8:58,57 --> 0:8:59,64
VALERIE VARGAS (OFFSCREEN):
It really works for us.


225
0:8:59,64 --> 0:9:0,27
It's not for everybody.


226
0:9:0,27 --> 0:9:1,98
A lot of people do go,
how do you do it?


227
0:9:1,98 --> 0:9:3,91
How do you live together, go
to work together, work the


228
0:9:3,91 --> 0:9:8,1
same days, and hang out together
on your days off?


229
0:9:8,1 --> 0:9:8,945
I don't know.


230
0:9:8,945 --> 0:9:10,195
It works.


231
0:9:10,195 --> 0:9:13,22



232
0:9:13,22 --> 0:9:14,71
Can't hug you with this?


233
0:9:14,71 --> 0:9:15,96
STEWART ROBSON (OFFSCREEN):
I know, bags everywhere.


234
0:9:15,96 --> 0:9:18,41



235
0:9:18,41 --> 0:9:19,28
VALERIE VARGAS: You
having fun?


236
0:9:19,28 --> 0:9:21,26
STEWART ROBSON: Yeah.


237
0:9:21,26 --> 0:9:23,0
STEWART ROBSON (OFFSCREEN):
[INAUDIBLE]


238
0:9:23,0 --> 0:9:24,18
A little bit.


239
0:9:24,18 --> 0:9:24,66
VALERIE VARGAS: What
do you want?


240
0:9:24,66 --> 0:9:27,58
STEWART ROBSON: Just
stand there.


241
0:9:27,58 --> 0:9:28,83
[INAUDIBLE]


242
0:9:28,83 --> 0:9:31,49



243
0:9:31,49 --> 0:9:34,11
VALERIE VARGAS: Hang on.


244
0:9:34,11 --> 0:9:34,92
Yeah?


245
0:9:34,92 --> 0:9:35,16
Enough?


246
0:9:35,16 --> 0:9:36,88
STEWART ROBSON: You hate having
your picture taken.


247
0:9:36,88 --> 0:9:39,75
VALERIE VARGAS: I hate having
my picture taken.


248
0:9:39,75 --> 0:9:40,895
STEWART ROBSON: [INAUDIBLE]


249
0:9:40,895 --> 0:9:42,64
VALERIE VARGAS: Yeah, he loves
having his picture taken.


250
0:9:42,64 --> 0:11:42,64
