1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:17,29



2
0:0:17,29 --> 0:0:19,42
PATRICK O'DELL: We
need an intro.


3
0:0:19,42 --> 0:0:20,33
JAVIER NUNEZ: An intro?


4
0:0:20,33 --> 0:0:22,191
All right.


5
0:0:22,191 --> 0:0:28,6
It's Javier Nunez, aka Hands.


6
0:0:28,6 --> 0:0:31,825
And we're going to go inside the
store talk about Menace.


7
0:0:31,825 --> 0:0:34,15
Good old Menace days
that a lot of


8
0:0:34,15 --> 0:0:36,6
people have yet to hear.


9
0:0:36,6 --> 0:0:38,5
All right.


10
0:0:38,5 --> 0:0:39,732
Come on guys.


11
0:0:39,732 --> 0:0:41,642
Let's talk.


12
0:0:41,642 --> 0:0:42,72
PATRICK O'DELL: Where
are you from?


13
0:0:42,72 --> 0:0:44,33
JAVIER NUNEZ: Bayonne,
New Jersey.


14
0:0:44,33 --> 0:0:47,57
PATRICK O'DELL: How
far is that?


15
0:0:47,57 --> 0:0:49,18
JAVIER NUNEZ: Well, when you
take the bus and train, it


16
0:0:49,18 --> 0:0:51,64
took me about an hour.


17
0:0:51,64 --> 0:0:54,51
I be in sixth grade, seventh
grade, after school I go to


18
0:0:54,51 --> 0:0:55,37
New York by myself.


19
0:0:55,37 --> 0:0:56,49
I'll just be out.


20
0:0:56,49 --> 0:0:58,475
I'm like, I'm not chilling
in Jersey.


21
0:0:58,475 --> 0:1:1,67
I'll go to New York and meet my
other friends, skating in


22
0:1:1,67 --> 0:1:2,87
the skate side.


23
0:1:2,87 --> 0:1:4,319
My name is Javier Nunez.


24
0:1:4,319 --> 0:1:7,217
I've been skating for
a year and a half.


25
0:1:7,217 --> 0:1:9,149
I'm age 11.


26
0:1:9,149 --> 0:1:12,47
The most place I like to
skate is the banks.


27
0:1:12,47 --> 0:1:15,34
The "Wheels of Fortune," was
just I was skating the banks,


28
0:1:15,34 --> 0:1:19,56
and Pepe Martinez was up there
with his filmer from DC.


29
0:1:19,56 --> 0:1:21,5
I believe his name was
Dave Schubert.


30
0:1:21,5 --> 0:1:24,45
And fuck yeah, he just saw
me skating the banks.


31
0:1:24,45 --> 0:1:26,31
Pretty much all those tricks
that he filmed me


32
0:1:26,31 --> 0:1:27,41
do, I really did.


33
0:1:27,41 --> 0:1:30,12
And he was like, dude, let's
film that again, and get you a


34
0:1:30,12 --> 0:1:32,73
little thing on this
"411 Magazine."


35
0:1:32,73 --> 0:1:33,17
Let's interview you.


36
0:1:33,17 --> 0:1:34,14
I'm like, all right, cool.


37
0:1:34,14 --> 0:1:38,55
And then that was all filmed
in 15, 20 minutes.


38
0:1:38,55 --> 0:1:38,67
PATRICK O'DELL: The
whole part?


39
0:1:38,67 --> 0:1:39,69
JAVIER NUNEZ: The whole part.


40
0:1:39,69 --> 0:1:40,655
Yeah, it was quick.


41
0:1:40,655 --> 0:1:42,42
It wasn't that long.


42
0:1:42,42 --> 0:1:47,915
STEVIE WILLIAMS: 411 days, he
was the fucking little Spanish


43
0:1:47,915 --> 0:1:50,6
dude skating at the banks.


44
0:1:50,6 --> 0:1:54,23
And I was the black
kid from Philly.


45
0:1:54,23 --> 0:1:58,7
He skated for Dead End, and
I skated for Element.


46
0:1:58,7 --> 0:2:2,5
He would come down to Philly,
stay at my house, hang with


47
0:2:2,5 --> 0:2:4,21
the homies, skate.


48
0:2:4,21 --> 0:2:9,78
And you know my mom, we got so
many crazy little kid stories


49
0:2:9,78 --> 0:2:15,22
in my house that me and him will
forever, forever, forever


50
0:2:15,22 --> 0:2:16,492
be friends.


51
0:2:16,492 --> 0:2:17,8
JAVIER NUNEZ: I know
you obviously


52
0:2:17,8 --> 0:2:19,6
saw this book already.


53
0:2:19,6 --> 0:2:21,81
Scoops--


54
0:2:21,81 --> 0:2:24,736
pretty much what we're talking
about, that whole era.


55
0:2:24,736 --> 0:2:27,78



56
0:2:27,78 --> 0:2:29,69
See, that was actually
me right here when


57
0:2:29,69 --> 0:2:31,155
I was on Dead End.


58
0:2:31,155 --> 0:2:34,46
Before Zoo York, that
was my hat.


59
0:2:34,46 --> 0:2:38,21
And then we have me skating
through Manhattan.


60
0:2:38,21 --> 0:2:40,33
This whole book, Ari
Marcopoulos shot.


61
0:2:40,33 --> 0:2:43,2
He told me to this day, Jav, I
remember you being young and


62
0:2:43,2 --> 0:2:45,75
cursing me out, telling your
friends, why is this old man


63
0:2:45,75 --> 0:2:47,265
following us for the photos?


64
0:2:47,265 --> 0:2:49,91
Obviously, I got mad
a little for it.


65
0:2:49,91 --> 0:2:51,86
But yeah, he tells me
that every time.


66
0:2:51,86 --> 0:2:53,69
You're cursing me out when
you were 12 years old.


67
0:2:53,69 --> 0:2:56,51
And I told him I'm sorry Ari,
but that was when I was young.


68
0:2:56,51 --> 0:2:58,985
I didn't know no better.


69
0:2:58,985 --> 0:3:0,16
That's the whole crew.


70
0:3:0,16 --> 0:3:3,93
That's pretty much the crew
you be skating with.


71
0:3:3,93 --> 0:3:7,49
You can see in this photo,
Harold Hunter just being


72
0:3:7,49 --> 0:3:9,905
himself, snapping on somebody.


73
0:3:9,905 --> 0:3:12,9
And then look, he got
all of us laughing.


74
0:3:12,9 --> 0:3:15,52
I was around all these guys
going to clubs in New York--


75
0:3:15,52 --> 0:3:18,14
being exposed to so much shit
that these kids in my fifth


76
0:3:18,14 --> 0:3:20,8
grade class had no clue.


77
0:3:20,8 --> 0:3:23,745
I couldn't have conversations
with them just because they


78
0:3:23,745 --> 0:3:24,74
weren't on my level.


79
0:3:24,74 --> 0:3:26,5
PATRICK O'DELL: Who's
your skate crew?


80
0:3:26,5 --> 0:3:27,86
JAVIER NUNEZ: We were considered
the young dudes,


81
0:3:27,86 --> 0:3:32,5
because everyone was older, so
it was me, Maurice Key, Joey


82
0:3:32,5 --> 0:3:36,67
Alvarez, all the usual suspects
from late '90s, mid


83
0:3:36,67 --> 0:3:39,49
'90s that were skating
at the time.


84
0:3:39,49 --> 0:3:41,48
PATRICK O'DELL: Is that around
the time you were in "Kids"?


85
0:3:41,48 --> 0:3:43,63
JAVIER NUNEZ: Yeah, pretty much
all this shit happened in


86
0:3:43,63 --> 0:3:45,49
the span of two years, man.


87
0:3:45,49 --> 0:3:47,81
Once I got my foot in New York,
I started meeting all


88
0:3:47,81 --> 0:3:48,86
these people.


89
0:3:48,86 --> 0:3:50,34
They took me under their wing.


90
0:3:50,34 --> 0:3:53,81
Harold was the one that
got me in "Kids."


91
0:3:53,81 --> 0:3:56,55
HAROLD HUNTER: My name is Harold
Hunter, and I skate for


92
0:3:56,55 --> 0:4:0,1
American Dream, which
is totally cool.


93
0:4:0,1 --> 0:4:1,555
JAVIER NUNEZ: We just skating
through the city, just pulsing


94
0:4:1,555 --> 0:4:4,6
up our aster, and then Harmony
Korine comes walking by.


95
0:4:4,6 --> 0:4:6,85
Harold saw Harmony and was
like, Harmony, you


96
0:4:6,85 --> 0:4:8,18
got to put Jav in.


97
0:4:8,18 --> 0:4:10,3
You got to write him
in the movie.


98
0:4:10,3 --> 0:4:11,46
Harold was serious to Harmony.


99
0:4:11,46 --> 0:4:13,46
Harmony was like, yeah,
you know what?


100
0:4:13,46 --> 0:4:17,47
I actually got a role for
you in the movie.


101
0:4:17,47 --> 0:4:18,269
So I was like, cool.


102
0:4:18,269 --> 0:4:19,22
I didn't think nothing of it.


103
0:4:19,22 --> 0:4:23,196
PATRICK O'DELL: Oh, is it
real alcohol, real weed?


104
0:4:23,196 --> 0:4:25,45
JAVIER NUNEZ: Today it was real
weed, but I already was


105
0:4:25,45 --> 0:4:28,5
smoking before we were doing
the film, so I was already


106
0:4:28,5 --> 0:4:30,75
exposed to all of that.


107
0:4:30,75 --> 0:4:33,34
And then, he just made us feel
comfortable by letting us


108
0:4:33,34 --> 0:4:35,52
really smoke weed.


109
0:4:35,52 --> 0:4:36,815
No biggie.


110
0:4:36,815 --> 0:4:38,28
STEVIE WILLIAMS: I just
thought Jav was


111
0:4:38,28 --> 0:4:39,29
just bigger than life.


112
0:4:39,29 --> 0:4:44,0
I'm like damn, he shot
past me like crazy.


113
0:4:44,0 --> 0:4:44,85
He was the model.


114
0:4:44,85 --> 0:4:48,32
He was doing TV shows and movies
and "Kids." When he got


115
0:4:48,32 --> 0:4:51,63
on Menace, I was like, damn!


116
0:4:51,63 --> 0:4:53,61
He's going to be one of the
best teams in the world.


117
0:4:53,61 --> 0:4:57,0
He had to sponsor, so when he
came up to San Francisco, and


118
0:4:57,0 --> 0:4:58,64
I was ripping around in
the streets, he would


119
0:4:58,64 --> 0:4:59,9
be right with me.


120
0:4:59,9 --> 0:5:2,52
Because he already had to
sponsor, so he could go and


121
0:5:2,52 --> 0:5:4,57
shoot photos with all of them,
and then come back


122
0:5:4,57 --> 0:5:5,75
to hang with me.


123
0:5:5,75 --> 0:5:10,39
I just really thought Jav was
the truth as a young kid.


124
0:5:10,39 --> 0:5:14,32



125
0:5:14,32 --> 0:5:17,21
JAVIER NUNEZ: The switch flip
over the wall, couple Cali


126
0:5:17,21 --> 0:5:23,65
tricks, something
on the banks.


127
0:5:23,65 --> 0:5:26,82
I didn't really have a full part
in the "Trilogy." Like I


128
0:5:26,82 --> 0:5:29,75
said, man, I should have been
more of my skating as well.


129
0:5:29,75 --> 0:5:30,91
I have myself to blame.


130
0:5:30,91 --> 0:5:33,3
I don't blame no one else,
because I was a little


131
0:5:33,3 --> 0:5:33,82
knucklehead back then.


132
0:5:33,82 --> 0:5:38,4
And to be honest, I didn't
listen to Reem half the time.


133
0:5:38,4 --> 0:5:39,49
I didn't really skate much--


134
0:5:39,49 --> 0:5:42,0
like I said, me being
around a whole


135
0:5:42,0 --> 0:5:44,68
different world of people.


136
0:5:44,68 --> 0:5:46,795
All my friends didn't
skate every day.


137
0:5:46,795 --> 0:5:48,45
[INAUDIBLE].


138
0:5:48,45 --> 0:5:51,68



139
0:5:51,68 --> 0:5:56,27
Not like out here, where people
skate every day and


140
0:5:56,27 --> 0:5:58,67
have a clique of friends that
is willing to film.


141
0:5:58,67 --> 0:6:1,34



142
0:6:1,34 --> 0:6:3,28
That's what made me
move to Cali.


143
0:6:3,28 --> 0:6:6,88
To be honest, if it wasn't for
Kareem, I wouldn't be involved


144
0:6:6,88 --> 0:6:9,5
that much in skating, because
he's the one that took me out


145
0:6:9,5 --> 0:6:12,7
of New York, New Jersey to
expose me to the whole skate


146
0:6:12,7 --> 0:6:13,88
world industry.


147
0:6:13,88 --> 0:6:15,41
I never forget that.


148
0:6:15,41 --> 0:6:17,387
PATRICK O'DELL: You were on
when it was Fabian and all


149
0:6:17,387 --> 0:6:19,65
these people to when it was
Spanky and all those people.


150
0:6:19,65 --> 0:6:21,96
JAVIER NUNEZ: Yeah,
pretty much.


151
0:6:21,96 --> 0:6:24,62
When it came to our city,
I was the older one.


152
0:6:24,62 --> 0:6:26,76
It wasn't Little Jav no more.


153
0:6:26,76 --> 0:6:30,65
It was Little P-Rod, Little
Devine, Little Mikey.


154
0:6:30,65 --> 0:6:33,28
PATRICK O'DELL: And none of
the people that were older


155
0:6:33,28 --> 0:6:35,0
than you were on anymore?


156
0:6:35,0 --> 0:6:35,96
JAVIER NUNEZ: No,
except for Lee.


157
0:6:35,96 --> 0:6:37,54
It was just only me
and Lee left.


158
0:6:37,54 --> 0:6:40,62



159
0:6:40,62 --> 0:6:42,59
PATRICK O'DELL: You had
a board on City Stars?


160
0:6:42,59 --> 0:6:44,555
Unfortunately not, I never had
a board on City Stars.


161
0:6:44,555 --> 0:6:47,212
My first pro board was Shut.


162
0:6:47,212 --> 0:6:49,27
PATRICK O'DELL: Did he ever
express to you, fuck, why


163
0:6:49,27 --> 0:6:50,52
aren't they turning me pro?


164
0:6:50,52 --> 0:6:56,75



165
0:6:56,75 --> 0:6:58,6
STEVIE WILLIAMS: I can't
even go there.


166
0:6:58,6 --> 0:6:59,62
I can't.


167
0:6:59,62 --> 0:7:0,88
Because it hurts.


168
0:7:0,88 --> 0:7:3,98
It hurts me to know that--


169
0:7:3,98 --> 0:7:4,68
it just hurt, yo.


170
0:7:4,68 --> 0:7:7,75
Yeah, of course, Javier would
get solidate that Kareem


171
0:7:7,75 --> 0:7:10,765
turned Paul and them dudes
pro and all of that.


172
0:7:10,765 --> 0:7:14,685
And I was there with him
every fucking day.


173
0:7:14,685 --> 0:7:18,49
Me and Reem had a fall
out because of Jav.


174
0:7:18,49 --> 0:7:22,84
And I respected Kareem so much
that I didn't want to


175
0:7:22,84 --> 0:7:28,37
disrespect Kareem, but
Javier was my blood.


176
0:7:28,37 --> 0:7:31,93
I knew him before he
even met Kareem.


177
0:7:31,93 --> 0:7:36,84
By the time it was for him to
shine and get that value from


178
0:7:36,84 --> 0:7:41,28
Menace, it was already City
Stars and Kareem already had


179
0:7:41,28 --> 0:7:42,1
all of these dudes.


180
0:7:42,1 --> 0:7:47,22
So when Jav wanted that light,
I don't think the light was


181
0:7:47,22 --> 0:7:49,38
shining on that team anymore.


182
0:7:49,38 --> 0:7:51,99
So it's hard.


183
0:7:51,99 --> 0:7:54,82
You got to do it when it's
supposed to be done.


184
0:7:54,82 --> 0:7:56,73
PATRICK O'DELL: Were you bummed
at all when P-Rod


185
0:7:56,73 --> 0:7:57,285
turned pro?


186
0:7:57,285 --> 0:7:59,69
JAVIER NUNEZ: Yeah, I wasn't
bummed that P-Rod--


187
0:7:59,69 --> 0:8:1,52
he deserved it, obviously.


188
0:8:1,52 --> 0:8:2,87
But I was like, you know what?


189
0:8:2,87 --> 0:8:4,77
Yeah, I was kind of bummed
out on Reem.


190
0:8:4,77 --> 0:8:7,4
I was like, it's kind of lame.


191
0:8:7,4 --> 0:8:9,65
I been with his team forever,
and these dudes are getting


192
0:8:9,65 --> 0:8:12,11
boards before me.


193
0:8:12,11 --> 0:8:14,285
But I guess, he felt like these
dudes are killing it and


194
0:8:14,285 --> 0:8:16,5
all this shit, which
oh, whatever, man.


195
0:8:16,5 --> 0:8:21,18



196
0:8:21,18 --> 0:8:23,28
STEVIE WILLIAMS: Jav's
hard-headed.


197
0:8:23,28 --> 0:8:23,9
That's all I'm going say.


198
0:8:23,9 --> 0:8:24,925
That's my man.


199
0:8:24,925 --> 0:8:27,14
And I love him, but
Jav's going to do


200
0:8:27,14 --> 0:8:28,46
what he want to do.


201
0:8:28,46 --> 0:8:30,8
And that's just Javier.


202
0:8:30,8 --> 0:8:32,14
Everybody's different.


203
0:8:32,14 --> 0:8:37,24
Jav had the chance to
be where I'm at.


204
0:8:37,24 --> 0:8:41,38
And when he was given
a decision, he


205
0:8:41,38 --> 0:8:42,64
didn't take it, yo.


206
0:8:42,64 --> 0:8:43,48
And he got the opportunity.


207
0:8:43,48 --> 0:8:45,68
He didn't take it.


208
0:8:45,68 --> 0:8:47,2
He still has the skills.


209
0:8:47,2 --> 0:8:51,9
And it's harder to get on
companies when you're older,


210
0:8:51,9 --> 0:8:53,73
so you might want to take
advantage of those things in


211
0:8:53,73 --> 0:8:55,6
your early 20s.


212
0:8:55,6 --> 0:8:58,93
JAVIER NUNEZ: My mind, I wasn't
always 100% focused


213
0:8:58,93 --> 0:9:2,1
with skateboarding, which
I wish I was.


214
0:9:2,1 --> 0:9:5,1
But I'm trying to get back into
the swing of things and


215
0:9:5,1 --> 0:9:6,92
just skate a lot.


216
0:9:6,92 --> 0:9:9,87
I took a lot of things for
granted when I was younger.


217
0:9:9,87 --> 0:9:12,66
And as I get older, you start
realizing this shit, learn


218
0:9:12,66 --> 0:9:14,52
from your experiences.


219
0:9:14,52 --> 0:9:16,0
PATRICK O'DELL: And
you have HBO show.


220
0:9:16,0 --> 0:9:20,75
JAVIER NUNEZ: Yeah, and now, the
producer from "Entourage,"


221
0:9:20,75 --> 0:9:24,67
Rob Weiss, happened to come by
the shop and was like, know


222
0:9:24,67 --> 0:9:25,28
what, dude?


223
0:9:25,28 --> 0:9:27,27
You're perfect for this
character I have.


224
0:9:27,27 --> 0:9:28,52
You fit perfect, man.


225
0:9:28,52 --> 0:9:30,81
It's about this crazy
skateboarder, bipolar dude


226
0:9:30,81 --> 0:9:32,1
from New York.


227
0:9:32,1 --> 0:9:34,55
But I don't let these dudes
blow air up my ass.


228
0:9:34,55 --> 0:9:35,63
I'm like, all right,
it is what it is.


229
0:9:35,63 --> 0:9:37,33
Before you know a couple months
down the line it gets


230
0:9:37,33 --> 0:9:40,88
picked up for first season.


231
0:9:40,88 --> 0:9:42,362
WILFREDO GOMEZ: I'm going to
make you real proud at the


232
0:9:42,362 --> 0:9:44,582
event today, watch.


233
0:9:44,582 --> 0:9:46,3
I'm feeling real good.


234
0:9:46,3 --> 0:9:48,144
RENE CALDERON: Just don't
set no kids on fire.


235
0:9:48,144 --> 0:9:50,91



236
0:9:50,91 --> 0:9:54,21
JAVIER NUNEZ: The season was
over, but now, HBO picked up


237
0:9:54,21 --> 0:9:59,58
the season again to come out
in the summer of 2011.


238
0:9:59,58 --> 0:10:2,47
So I go to New York in March
to start filming.


239
0:10:2,47 --> 0:10:5,236



240
0:10:5,236 --> 0:10:9,6
Is LA a lot different
than New York?


241
0:10:9,6 --> 0:10:9,96
JAVIER NUNEZ: It is.


242
0:10:9,96 --> 0:10:13,15
It's more relaxing for me.


243
0:10:13,15 --> 0:10:13,91
I did it.


244
0:10:13,91 --> 0:10:19,7
We did it all, running around
New York City when it was real


245
0:10:19,7 --> 0:10:20,7
grimy at the time.


246
0:10:20,7 --> 0:10:22,86
And it was real fun.


247
0:10:22,86 --> 0:10:25,22
A time for a change
in my life, I did


248
0:10:25,22 --> 0:10:25,97
the New York thing.


249
0:10:25,97 --> 0:10:32,105
Now, I come to LA to get
different things going on.


250
0:10:32,105 --> 0:10:32,423
PATRICK O'DELL: Cool.


251
0:10:32,423 --> 0:10:33,16
Thanks, Javier.


252
0:10:33,16 --> 0:10:35,79
JAVIER NUNEZ: No doubt
thank you, Pat.


253
0:10:35,79 --> 0:10:37,4
STEVIE WILLIAMS: I got a crazy
a story about Jav.


254
0:10:37,4 --> 0:10:42,9



255
0:10:42,9 --> 0:10:43,37
We in my crib, right?


256
0:10:43,37 --> 0:10:45,94
And we was playing this knockout
game, where you stand


257
0:10:45,94 --> 0:10:46,91
up against the wall.


258
0:10:46,91 --> 0:10:49,84
And then you hold your breath,
and they pump on your chest.


259
0:10:49,84 --> 0:10:52,11
Jav pumped my chest.


260
0:10:52,11 --> 0:10:53,12
I black out.


261
0:10:53,12 --> 0:10:55,94
I have a dream that Ryan
Hickey frontside


262
0:10:55,94 --> 0:10:57,97
flips the bank wall.


263
0:10:57,97 --> 0:11:0,18
Next thing I know
I hear, boom!


264
0:11:0,18 --> 0:11:2,135
I wake up like what the fuck?


265
0:11:2,135 --> 0:11:6,231
I'm face first on the coffee
table, and my mom's like, what


266
0:11:6,231 --> 0:11:7,72
the fuck is going on?


267
0:11:7,72 --> 0:11:10,86
And I look at Javier's face and
Mancha's face is like oh


268
0:11:10,86 --> 0:11:13,2
shit, you almost died.


269
0:11:13,2 --> 0:11:15,1
We played a knockout game, and
somebody's supposed to catch


270
0:11:15,1 --> 0:11:16,11
them if they fall.


271
0:11:16,11 --> 0:11:19,24
He just let me fall and fucking
hit my face on the


272
0:11:19,24 --> 0:11:20,74
coffee table.


273
0:11:20,74 --> 0:11:23,66
And I looked at this nigger
like, yo, I should fuck


274
0:11:23,66 --> 0:11:24,93
you up right now.


275
0:11:24,93 --> 0:11:27,1
I'm glad I didn't die.


276
0:11:27,1 --> 0:11:28,87
And me and Jav always
bug out on that.


277
0:11:28,87 --> 0:13:28,87
