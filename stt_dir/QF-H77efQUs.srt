AT ALL. REMEMBER THEY JUST GOT DONE ADDING
THE GENERATORS A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO. THEY

TO SUBMIT AN ACTION LETTER ON THOSE REPAIRS


76
0:8:42,31 --> 0:8:49,209

UNIT THREE MEAN THEY HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT WHAT


77
0:8:49,209 --> 0:8:53,55
TO DO TWHIS REACTOR OR SOMETHING ELSE? >> >>MURRAY
JENNEX: ACTUALLY T MEANS THAT THEY'RE PUT


78
0:8:53,55 --> 0:8:59,22
TG INTO A LOW COST MAINTENANCE SITUATION.
THE DEFUELING REDUCES THE STAFFING REQUIREMENT


79
0:8:59,22 --> 0:9:4,11

A VERY NORMAL ACTIVITY THAT THEY DO EVERY

ARE THERE CERTAIN PEOPLE WHO TYPICALLY GET

GOING TO CUT INTO PERMANENT STAFF, THEY WU

WOULD LOOK AT WHAT THE KNOWLEDGE NEEDS CAPABILITIES
ARE TO OPERATE THE PLANT AS THEY EXPECT TO

EXPERTISE THEY CAN USE. >> >>PEGGY: SOUTHERN

IS THAT SOMETHING THEY DO ROUTINELY, A FINANCIAL

0:10:30,639 --> 0:10:35,829
STARTED DOING A BENCH MARKING EXERCISE IN
ABOUT THE YEAR 2000. SINCE THEN THEY'VE BEEN


97
0:10:35,829 --> 0:10:43,17
ON GOING. ALL THE PLANTS COMPARE THEMSELVES.

>> >>MURRAY JENNEX: THEY COULD PROBABLY GO


100
0:10:54,389 --> 0:11:1,69
WITH 1300. WHAT I EXPECT THEY'RE DOING IS
ALLOWING NATURAL ATTRITION TO LOWER IT MORE.

WITH THE TUBE ISSUES IS POINTING TO A PERMANENT

I DON'T THINK YOU CAN READ THAT AT ALL. I


103
0:11:8,129 --> 0:11:11,649
THEY DON'T THINK THEY'RE LOWERING THE COSTS
TO BE PRUDENT, WHICH IS WHAT THE RATE PAYERS


104
0:11:11,649 --> 0:11:16,649
WOULD EXPECT. I THINK THEY UNDERSTAND POLITICALLY
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO GET UNITED THREE RUNNING


105
0:11:16,649 --> 0:11:25,259
RIGHT AWAY, AND I THINK THEY'RE GOING TO BE
DOING AN ON GOING ECONOMIC ANALYSIS TO SEE

0:11:25,259 --> 0:11:30,699
WHAT IS THE MOST PRUDENT ACTIVITY TO DO WITH
THE UNIT. >> >>PEGGY: WE'RE OFTEN TOLD THERE'S

108
0:11:39,199 --> 0:11:46,67

ANYMORE? >> >>MURRAY JENNEX: WELL, THE NEED


109
0:11:46,67 --> 0:11:53,61
IS MORE ECONOMIC THAN IT IS, I GUESS, FROM
A PURE POWER REQUIREMENT. THE POWER LINK HAS


110
0:11:53,61 --> 0:11:58,689
DEFINITELY IMPROVED POWER RELIABILITY IN SAN
DIEGO. BUT SAN ONOFRE HAS BEEN A LOW COST


111
0:11:58,689 --> 0:12:3,259
PROVIDER FOR MANY YEARS. PLUS THE CONCERN
I STILL HAVE IS I DON'T THINK YOU CAN HAVE


112
0:12:3,259 --> 0:12:10,18
A LARGE AREA WITH A LARGE POPULATION AND NOT
HAVE SOME POWER PRODUCTION LOCAL. RIGHT NOW,


113
0:12:10,18 --> 0:12:14,459

ALWAYS BE AVAILABLE. >> >>PEGGY: ALL RIGHT.

0:15:8,959 --> 0:15:14,48
DIDN'T BELIEVE IN, WE SHOULD PUT THEM TO WORK
ON PROBLEMS THEY HAVE A STAKE IN RIGHT NOW.


145
0:15:14,48 --> 0:15:18,759
WE REASONED THAT IF WE DID THAT THAT WOULD
MOTIVATE TO LEARN, WE WOULD HAVE TO CHOOSE


146
0:15:18,759 --> 0:15:21,85
THOSE PROBLEMS SO THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO
LEARN WHAT WE WANTED THEM TO KNOW TO GET WHAT


147
0:15:21,85 --> 0:15:30,279
THEY WANT. >> >>PEGGY: A STUDENT SITS DOWN,
AND WHAT DOES THIS PROGRAM OFFER THEM? >> >>ROBERT


148
0:15:30,279 --> 0:15:37,819
BRIGGS: IT WAS ORIGINALLY DESIGNED TO BE USED
IN BUSINESS AND IT WAS VERY EFFECTIVE THERE.


149
0:15:37,819 --> 0:15:42,91
AND WE USED IT TO MAKE PROBLEM SOLVING TIME
MUCH SORT SHORTER. >> >>PEGGY: WALK US THROUGH


150
0:15:42,91 --> 0:15:47,339
IT. >> >>ROBERT BRIGGS: AN EXAMPLE, THE CHILDREN
DIDN'T WANT TO STUDY HISTORY, SO I SUGGESTED


151
0:15:47,339 --> 0:15:53,699
TO THEM HISTORY MIGHT BE A SHORT CUT FOR ACHIEVING
GREATNESS. WE PUT THEM INTO A BRAIN STORMING


152
0:15:53,699 --> 0:15:58,649
SESSION, WHO ARE YOUR FAVORITE HEROS FROM
HISTORY, THEY GENERATE AD LIST, WE SAID VOTE


153
0:15:58,649 --> 0:16:2,899
ON IT, WHO DO YOU WANT TO LOOK AT RIGHT NOW,
THEY CHOSE MARTIN LUTHER KING, I SAID GREAT,


154
0:16:2,899 --> 0:16:8,5
LET'S BRAIN STORM, WHAT MAKES HIM GREAT, THEY
GENERATED A LIST OF 13 ATTRIBUTES OF GREATNESS,


155
0:16:8,5 --> 0:16:20,929
THEN WE'RE GOING TO WRITE A POEM PO EM, SPEED
POETRY, WE MADE A RACE,. >> >>PEGGY: SO THEY


156
0:16:20,929 --> 0:16:27,309
FOUND THIS TO BE RELEVANT, THE SUCCESS RATE
>> >>ROBERT BRIGGS: IT WAS THEIR HERO AND


157
0:16:27,309 --> 0:16:31,54
THEIR INCITES AND THEIR WORK, WHICH THEN,
YOU KNOW, THERE WAS A POEM THAT DIDN'T EXIST


158
0:16:31,54 --> 0:16:36,809
WHEN THEY CAME IN THAT MORNING. SO THAT WORKED.
WE RAN PROJECTS LIKE THAT OVER A COURSE OF


159
0:16:36,809 --> 0:16:41,269
TWO YEARS AND AT THE END OF TWO YEARS, THEY
WERE TWO YEARS AHEAD OF THEIR PEER ON READING


160
0:16:41,269 --> 0:16:46,949
AND WRITING SCORES AND THEY WERE OFF THE CHARTS
ON CREATIVE PROBLEM SOLVING SCORES. >> >>PEGGY:


161
0:16:46,949 --> 0:16:51,449
HOW IS THE CLASSROOM TEACHER IN THIS? >> >>ROBERT
BRIGGS: THE CLASSROOM TEACHER CAN LEAD THE


162
0:16:51,449 --> 0:16:56,429
EXERCISES, AND THE CLASSROOM TEACHER HAS TO
GET TO KNOW WHAT THEY CARE ABOUT SO SHE CAN


163
0:16:56,429 --> 0:17:0,11
PICK THE PROBLEMS U.YOU ACTUALLY HAD TO DO
SOME TRAINING FOR TEACHERS? >> >>ROBERT BRIGGS:


164
0:17:0,11 --> 0:17:9,39
WE DID, WE HAD A SUCCESS ACADEMICALLY AND
A FAILURE TRANSFERRING TO THE TEACHERS. >> >>PEGGY:


165
0:17:9,39 --> 0:17:16,339
HOW COME? >> >>ROBERT BRIGGS: IT TOOK US 20
YEARS OF RESEARCH LEADING UP UNTIL JUST ABOUT


166
0:17:16,339 --> 0:17:20,99
A MONTH AGO BEFORE WE FELT WE WERE READY TO
GO BACK INTO THE CLASSROOMS. >> >>PEGGY: DOES


167
0:17:20,99 --> 0:17:26,439
THE SOFTWARE COME WITH A TEACHER COMPONENT,
SO A TRAINING COMPONENT? >> >>ROBERT BRIGGS:


168
0:17:26,439 --> 0:17:33,21
THE GOAL WAS TO DESIGN THE SOFTWARE SO IT
COULD BE RUN BY PEOPLE WITH NO TRAINING. >> >>PEGGY:


169
0:17:33,21 --> 0:17:37,779
DO YOU INCORPORATE STANDARD CURRICULUM? >> >>ROBERT
BRIGGS: WE DON'T INCORPORATE A CURRICULUM,


170
0:17:37,779 --> 0:17:44,5
BUT WE COVER THE SAME MATERIAL WITH A VERY
DIFFERENT KIND OF TEACHING APPROACH. >> >>PEGGY:


171
0:17:44,5 --> 0:17:48,559
HOW CAN A SCHOOL DISTRICT IF THEY WANT IT,
GET THE PROGRAM, AND HOW MUCH DOES IT COST?


172
0:17:48,559 --> 0:17:52,26
>> >>ROBERT BRIGGS: RIGHT NOW, THE SOFTWARE
IS FREE, BUT IT'S NOT SO MUCH THE SOFTWARE,


173
0:17:52,26 --> 0:17:57,22
IT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH IT. WE'RE RUNNING
A PILOTED PROGRAM IN CHICAGO, WE'RE GOING


174
0:17:57,22 --> 0:18:2,22
TO START THAT UP THIS COMING YEAR. IF THAT
PILOT PROKING PROGRAM IS SUCCESSFUL Y HAVE


175
0:18:2,22 --> 0:18:11,47
A TEACHER IN SAN DIEGO AND ONE IN TUCSON,
TO TEST IT. IF THAT GOES WELL, WE DO SOME


176
0:18:11,47 --> 0:18:16,7
PROOF OF VALUE RESEARCH IN A NUMBER OF CLASSROOMS
IN A NUMBER OF CITIES. >> >>PEGGY: HOW DOES


177
0:18:16,7 --> 0:18:22,14
IT FEEL TO BE SOMEBODY WHO DEVELOPED SOMETHING
THAT CAN ACTUALLY CHANGE SO MANY STUDENTS


178
0:18:22,14 --> 0:18:27,19
LIVES? >> >>ROBERT BRIGGS: IT'S SO EXCITING,
FEELING WE'RE RIGHT ON THE BRING TO MAKE THIS


179
0:18:27,19 --> 0:18:32,22
HAPPEN. WE FIEMY HAVE A WAY TO MAKE IF ACCESSIBLE
TO TEACHER WHICH MAKES IT ACCESSIBLE TO STUDENTS


180
0:18:32,22 --> 0:18:40,47
SO VERY EXCITING. >> >>PEGGY: THANK YOU DR.
BRIGS. >> >>DWANE: NOW STANDARDIZED TESTING


181
0:18:40,47 --> 0:18:45,789
HAS ITS CRITICS. THEY SAY ITS FOCUS ON BASIC
READING AND MATH SKILLS HAS CROWDED SUBJECTS


182
0:18:45,789 --> 0:18:51,74
LIKE ART AND SCIENCE OUT OF MANY SCHOOLS.
KYLA CALVERT TELLS US CALIFORNIA'S STARTING


183
0:18:51,74 --> 0:18:56,48
TO ROLL OUT NEW CURRICULUM STANDARDS THIS
YEAR, AND SOME FOLKS HOPE IT WILL BRING ART


184
0:18:56,48 --> 0:19:4,23
BACK TO THE CLASSROOM. >> >>: THERE ARE ABOUT
20 TEACHERS AT THIS REHEARSAL STUDENT. THE


185
0:19:4,23 --> 0:19:8,46
HALF FACING THE BACK OF THE ROOM ARE DRAWING
AND THE REST CAN SEE A PICTURE PROJECTED ON


186
0:19:8,46 --> 0:19:14,72
TO A SCREEN. TERRY MILLER IS DOING HER BEST
TO DESCRIBE WHAT SHE SEES SO HER PARTNER CAN


187
0:19:14,72 --> 0:19:24,95
SKETCH A REPLICA OF WHAT LOOKS LIKE THE REMNANTS
OF A MINING OPERATION. AFTER A FEW MINUTES


188
0:19:24,95 --> 0:19:29,679
OF DRAWING, MARVA CAPPELLO A SAN DIEGO STATE
PROFESSOR LEADING THE CLASS TELLS THOSE DRAWING


189
0:19:29,679 --> 0:19:46,38
TO TURN AROUND AND SEE THE IMAGE THEY'VE BEEN
TRYING TO O REPRODUCE. VOLUNTARY NATIONAL


190
0:19:46,38 --> 0:19:51,94
STANDARDS FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS. CALIFORNIA IS
JOINING 44 OF THEM IN WASHINGTON D.C. AND


191
0:19:51,94 --> 0:20:2,149
ADOPTING THE MATH ASK LANG LANGUAGE ARTS STANDARD.
THE SKILLS INCLUDE HIGHER ORDER SKILLS TOO.


192
0:20:2,149 --> 0:20:8,1
>> >>: THESE ARE DIFFERENT IN THAT THERE'S
A FOCUS ON CRITICAL THINKING AND PROBLEM SOLVING,


193
0:20:8,1 --> 0:20:15,8
THAT REALLY WASN'T IN THE CONTENT STANDARD
BEFORE. THERE ARE A FEW INSTRUCTIONAL SHIFTS


194
0:20:15,8 --> 0:20:20,39
WE HELP TEACHERS COME TO TERMS WITH. >> >>: BEFORE
IT'S TIME TO GO BACK TO CLASS, EDUCATORS FROM


195
0:20:20,39 --> 0:20:24,539
ACROSS SAN DIEGO COUNTY SPEND A WEEK AT LOCAL
CULTURAL INSTITUTIONS LIKE THE LA JOLLA PLAY


196
0:20:24,539 --> 0:20:32,389
HOUSE LEARNING HOW THEY CAN INCORPORATE THE
ARTS INTO THEIR NORMAL CURRICULUM. THIS DRAWING


197
0:20:32,389 --> 0:20:42,1
EXERCISE IS ONE PART OF THE EXERCISE. THE
TEACHERS VISITED THE TIMKEN, MINGEI, AND PHOTOGRAPHIC


198
0:20:42,1 --> 0:20:47,57
ARTS MUSEUMS IN BALBOA PARK. IN ANOTHER WORK
SHOP, THE TEACHERS ARE ROLE PLAYING WHERE


199
0:20:47,57 --> 0:21:0,84
THEY DI D SCRIBE DIFFERENT ARTIFACTS. LAURA
SLOAN IS TRYING TO USE MESSAGES LIKE THIS


200
0:21:0,84 --> 0:21:5,529
TO GET KIDS TO THINK ABOUT WHAT KIND OF LANGUAGE
TO USE WITH DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND IN DIFFERENT


201
0:21:5,529 --> 0:21:13,36
SITUATIONS. >> >>: IT HAS BEEN A WONDERFUL
EXPERIENCE. FROM THE STANDPOINT OF ALL MY


202
0:21:13,36 --> 0:21:19,69
KIDS CAN BE SUCCESSFUL USING THE STRATEGIES,
EVERY LAST ONE OF THEM REGARDLESS OF THEIR


203
0:21:19,69 --> 0:21:25,58
LABELS, REGARDLESS OF THEIR READING LEVELS
OR THEIR ENGLISH LANGUAGE FOR PROFICIENCY.


204
0:21:25,58 --> 0:21:35,98
>> >>: COLLEEN TEACHES FOURTH GRADE AT CRAVER.
>> >>: A LOT OF THINGS I THINK I CAN USE WITH


205
0:21:35,98 --> 0:21:41,59
FOURTH GRADE HI OIR, IS THE CALIFORNIA HISTORY,
WITH OUR SCIENCE STANDARDS, THAT I THINK WE'LL


206
0:21:41,59 --> 0:21:49,269
BE REALLY ENGAGING FOR THE KIDS AND ALSO TO
HELP THEM UNDERSTAND THE CONTENT. >> >>: CAPPELLO


207
0:21:49,269 --> 0:21:53,35
SAYS THERE AREN'T THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES TO
BE WRONG WITH THE KIND OF ARTS FOK OWS LESSONS


208
0:21:53,35 --> 0:22:2,62
SHE'S INTRODUCING TEACHERS TO. EACH STOONT
CAN PARTICIPATE IN SOME WAY. >> >>: I THINK


209
0:22:2,62 --> 0:22:9,7
THEY'RE MUCH MORE ENGAGED, MUCH MORE ACCOUNTABLE,
BECAUSE EACH STUDENT IS BEING ASKED TO DO


210
0:22:9,7 --> 0:22:13,97
SOMETHING THAT THEY'RE ABLE DO DO. WE HAVE
TAKEN SO MUCH ART OUT OF THE SCHOOL THAT AT


211
0:22:13,97 --> 0:22:22,1
LEAST WE GET A LITTLE CHANCE TO DO SOMETHING
ARTISTIC AND HANDS ON AND I THINK EACH KID


212
0:22:22,1 --> 0:22:28,9
IS ABLE TO DO UP TO THEIR LEVEL WHAT THEY
CAN DO. >> >>: CAPPELLO SAYS ITSELF JUST ABOUT


213
0:22:28,9 --> 0:22:33,769
BUSY WORK OR HAVING FUN IN CLASSES. >> >>: HELPING
STUDENTS USE ORAL AND WRITTEN LANGUAGE ALONG


214
0:22:33,769 --> 0:22:45,909
WITH PRINT 
HELPS THEM GET TO A DEEPER LEVEL OF UNDERSTANDING.
IT REALLY ENHANCES COMPREHENSION. >> >>: GETTING


215
0:22:45,909 --> 0:22:50,309
ARTS BACK INTO MORE SCHOOLS HAS ALWAYS BEEN
THE FOLK OS F CARE, WHICH IS A PARTNERSHIP


216
0:22:50,309 --> 0:22:58,809
OF THE INSTITUTES HOSTING THIS SEMINAR. THEY
TRY ESPECIALLY TO REACH TEACHERS IN LOW INCOME


217
0:22:58,809 --> 0:23:3,559
COMMUNITIES WHERE ARTS PROGRAMS ARE LEAST
LIKELY TO HAVE SURVIVED. >> >>: NOT ONLY IS


218
0:23:3,559 --> 0:23:10,21
THERE A PROBLEM OF DECLINING RESOURCES IN
PUBLIC EDUCATION, WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE


219
0:23:10,21 --> 0:23:16,539
ARE SEVERAL OUTCOMES THAT HAPPEN AS A RESULT
OF HAVING EXPOSURE TO THE ARTS. MANY OF THOSE


220
0:23:16,539 --> 0:23:25,59
ARE IMPORTANT TO A 20TH CENTURY WORK FORCE
N CLUING CRITICAL THINKING. >> >>: TERRY MILLER


221
0:23:25,59 --> 0:23:32,529
IS AN ARTS TEACHER. SHE'S HOPING THE COMMON
CORE STANDARDS WILL OFFER A WAY TO PROTECT


222
0:23:32,529 --> 0:23:39,95
PROGRAMS LIKE HERS. >> >>: I THINK I GAINED
AMMUNITION SO THAT WHEN THE BUDGET NEEDS TO


223
0:23:39,95 --> 0:23:45,44
BE CUT, I CAN SAY HEY, MY STUDENTS ARE WRITING,
NIE STUDENTS ARE SPEAKING, MY STUDENTS ARE


224
0:23:45,44 --> 0:23:52,139
LISTENING, MY STUDENTS ARE READING, MY STUDENTS
DEAL WITH SUBTEXT AND INFERENCE, AND SO IT


225
0:23:52,139 --> 0:23:56,789
MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO CUT IT OUT. >> >>: THIS
FALL CAPPELLO WILL TAKE TIME AWAY FROM TEACHING


226
0:23:56,789 --> 0:24:24,2
TO DISCOVER HOW VISUALIZING THINGS IN THE
CLASSROOM HELPS STUDENTS WITH LITERACY SKILLS.


227
0:24:24,2 --> 0:24:52,23
>> >>PEGGY: IN TONIGHT'S PUBLIC SQUARE FUNDING
CUTS WILL FORCE THE CLOSURE OF THREE CAMP


228
0:24:52,23 --> 0:24:57,669
PENDLETON COMMUNITY CENTERS. THE CENTERS PROVIDE
FOOD, CLASSES AND SUPPORT TO MILITARY FAMILIES.


229
0:24:57,669 --> 0:25:1,889
MARINE OFFICIALS SAY ONE CENTER WILL CLOSE
ON SEPTEMBER 7, THE OTHER TWO ON SEPTEMBER


230
0:25:1,889 --> 0:25:23,759
>> >>PEGGY: ANOTHER MILITARY NEWS, NEARLY
68 YEARS AFTER HE WENT MISSING OVER THE SKIES


231
0:25:23,759 --> 0:25:29,7
OF GERMANY, THE REMAINS OF ARMY AIR FORCE
STAFF SERGEANT JOHN E.H OGAN HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED


232
0:25:29,7 --> 0:25:38,899
AND RETURNED TO HIS FAMILY. THE DEPARTMENT
OF DEFENSE SAYS HE WAS PART OF A 19 MAN CREW


233
0:25:38,899 --> 0:25:50,659
WHEN HE WAS SHOT DOWN. HOGAN'S METAL DOG TAGS
WERE FOUND IN A GERMAN CEMETERY. HOGAN WILL


234
0:25:50,659 --> 0:25:56,0
BE BURIED AT THE ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY,
WITH FULL MILITARY HOPPERS ON FRIDAY. YOU
