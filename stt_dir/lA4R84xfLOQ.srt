[MUSIC PLAYING]


2
0:0:9,92 --> 0:0:17,856



3
0:0:17,856 --> 0:0:20,336
MALE SPEAKER : Whoa,
[INAUDIBLE]


4
0:0:20,336 --> 0:0:22,32
[LAUGHTER]


5
0:0:22,32 --> 0:0:27,776



6
0:0:27,776 --> 0:0:29,88
TONY SALES: My name's
Tony Sales.


7
0:0:29,88 --> 0:0:32,93
I'm 37 years of age.


8
0:0:32,93 --> 0:0:36,71
It's been said that I'm one of
Britain's biggest fraudsters.


9
0:0:36,71 --> 0:0:41,4
In my time as a fraudster, I
accumulated between 10 to 30


10
0:0:41,4 --> 0:0:42,505
million pounds.


11
0:0:42,505 --> 0:0:46,44
I spent six years of my life
on the run, of which at the


12
0:0:46,44 --> 0:0:48,46
end I served a prison
sentence.


13
0:0:48,46 --> 0:0:53,31
I've now set up a company called
RID Fraud Ltd., which


14
0:0:53,31 --> 0:0:58,12
combats the sort of frauds that
I used to do to help this


15
0:0:58,12 --> 0:1:2,8
growing epidemic that's
happening throughout the UK.


16
0:1:2,8 --> 0:1:3,71
I could sell rice
to the Chinese.


17
0:1:3,71 --> 0:1:5,47
Committing fraud was as
easy as that for me.


18
0:1:5,47 --> 0:1:9,58



19
0:1:9,58 --> 0:1:13,39
The London fraud network is
huge, starting with young


20
0:1:13,39 --> 0:1:14,22
fraudsters--


21
0:1:14,22 --> 0:1:17,39
MALE SPEAKER: The police
couldn't give two flying pigs


22
0:1:17,39 --> 0:1:18,81
about fraud.


23
0:1:18,81 --> 0:1:22,92
I've only had one encounter, and
I managed to fraud that.


24
0:1:22,92 --> 0:1:27,87
TONY SALES: --To major organized
criminal gangs


25
0:1:27,87 --> 0:1:31,27
stealing multi-million
pounds through


26
0:1:31,27 --> 0:1:32,83
elaborate frauds and scams.


27
0:1:32,83 --> 0:1:35,8
MALE SPEAKER: People don't
want to appear silly.


28
0:1:35,8 --> 0:1:37,702
That's why they don't
ask questions.


29
0:1:37,702 --> 0:1:39,37
MALE SPEAKER: All your name has
to do is just pop up on


30
0:1:39,37 --> 0:1:41,39
one of our computers,
and it's done.


31
0:1:41,39 --> 0:1:42,375
That's you.


32
0:1:42,375 --> 0:1:43,24
MALE SPEAKER: Money
means nothing.


33
0:1:43,24 --> 0:1:44,49
Buy now, pay never.


34
0:1:44,49 --> 0:2:5,476



35
0:2:5,476 --> 0:2:7,99
TONY SALES: I'd put this
telephone number down for a


36
0:2:7,99 --> 0:2:10,61
number for my nan to contact
from the school.


37
0:2:10,61 --> 0:2:15,45
So if I decided to hop the wag
or play truant, she could ring


38
0:2:15,45 --> 0:2:18,89
this number, and I would answer
the phone and say,


39
0:2:18,89 --> 0:2:25,7
"Hello, Halstow School, can I
help you?" I was 11, 12 when I


40
0:2:25,7 --> 0:2:26,14
was doing that.


41
0:2:26,14 --> 0:2:28,33
We'd go to every single one of
those flats that were up in


42
0:2:28,33 --> 0:2:30,3
there and get people
to sign our


43
0:2:30,3 --> 0:2:32,1
sponsorship form for a pound.


44
0:2:32,1 --> 0:2:34,22
They'd phone a number, and
they'd say, "Hello, is the


45
0:2:34,22 --> 0:2:38,27
sponsorship form real?" And
again, we'd say, "Yes, the


46
0:2:38,27 --> 0:2:39,35
sponsorship form's real.


47
0:2:39,35 --> 0:2:41,12
It's from Halstow School."


48
0:2:41,12 --> 0:2:44,13
But when your belly's hungry,
and you need to eat, and you


49
0:2:44,13 --> 0:2:46,23
want to buy yourself a nice pair
of trainers that all the


50
0:2:46,23 --> 0:2:48,78
other kids have got on,
they're the only


51
0:2:48,78 --> 0:2:49,87
things you can do.


52
0:2:49,87 --> 0:2:51,18
And that's how you
learn the trade.


53
0:2:51,18 --> 0:3:0,395



54
0:3:0,395 --> 0:3:2,95
YOUNG CEE: This isn't
really the life.


55
0:3:2,95 --> 0:3:4,64
You're not making as
much money as you


56
0:3:4,64 --> 0:3:7,5
possibly can, legally.


57
0:3:7,5 --> 0:3:10,52
As soon as you apply for a job,
you have to wait forever.


58
0:3:10,52 --> 0:3:15,13
And while waiting, you're on
the streets, doing nothing.


59
0:3:15,13 --> 0:3:18,965
If you're not doing nothing,
then you're doing the daily


60
0:3:18,965 --> 0:3:20,92
grind, which is shotting
a little weed.


61
0:3:20,92 --> 0:3:23,76
CALLEY: You have to commit these
offenses in order to eat


62
0:3:23,76 --> 0:3:25,42
your food for the day.


63
0:3:25,42 --> 0:3:28,87
Obviously, there are risks
involved in doing them things.


64
0:3:28,87 --> 0:3:33,53
I've been shot at, and someone
tried to stab me.


65
0:3:33,53 --> 0:3:36,54
In my opinion, violence
ain't the answer.


66
0:3:36,54 --> 0:3:38,64
I would prefer to do
the fraud scams.


67
0:3:38,64 --> 0:3:42,25



68
0:3:42,25 --> 0:3:43,91
ALIAS: I'm just going to try
and find a nice pair of


69
0:3:43,91 --> 0:3:45,84
trainers for myself.


70
0:3:45,84 --> 0:3:49,1
Yeah, these are bad, innit?


71
0:3:49,1 --> 0:3:51,225
You can get card details
from hotels.


72
0:3:51,225 --> 0:3:55,42
You can get them from secret
fraternities online.


73
0:3:55,42 --> 0:3:57,67
Getting hold of it is easy.


74
0:3:57,67 --> 0:4:0,85
First got into it when I was a
teenager in secondary school--


75
0:4:0,85 --> 0:4:2,6
16, I would say.


76
0:4:2,6 --> 0:4:4,15
EBay scam.


77
0:4:4,15 --> 0:4:6,43
And I got some wrestling
figures.


78
0:4:6,43 --> 0:4:9,166
I mean, people would just ring
me up and say, mate, can you


79
0:4:9,166 --> 0:4:11,615
order me some Indian,
please, or a pizza?


80
0:4:11,615 --> 0:4:13,35
I'm fucking starving.


81
0:4:13,35 --> 0:4:16,589
I've done stuff for people, and
they haven't looked after


82
0:4:16,589 --> 0:4:17,91
me in return.


83
0:4:17,91 --> 0:4:20,47
With that being done, I know
everything about them.


84
0:4:20,47 --> 0:4:22,66
I'll just go and take a credit
card out in their name.


85
0:4:22,66 --> 0:4:23,71
I've even done it to a girl.


86
0:4:23,71 --> 0:4:26,88
She deleted me off of Facebook
and I put her arse into debt


87
0:4:26,88 --> 0:4:27,978
for doing that.


88
0:4:27,978 --> 0:4:29,89
[LAUGHS]


89
0:4:29,89 --> 0:4:31,4
That's what happens when you
delete me off Facebook.


90
0:4:31,4 --> 0:4:35,52
[LAUGHS]


91
0:4:35,52 --> 0:4:39,54
Top websites to completely
annihilate if you're low on


92
0:4:39,54 --> 0:4:41,43
money, need clothes,
want food.


93
0:4:41,43 --> 0:4:44,34
At number two is Harrods.


94
0:4:44,34 --> 0:4:46,96
The security in Harrods is
actually a pile of poo.


95
0:4:46,96 --> 0:4:51,0
I remember me and my Slovenian
boys, we raped it every single


96
0:4:51,0 --> 0:4:52,68
day for a month.


97
0:4:52,68 --> 0:4:54,755
They just went back to
Slovenia with all


98
0:4:54,755 --> 0:4:56,1
state of the art stuff.


99
0:4:56,1 --> 0:4:57,44
And out there, they
were getting top


100
0:4:57,44 --> 0:5:0,97
dollar for it, as well.


101
0:5:0,97 --> 0:5:4,45
At number one is Tesco,
it's my favorite.


102
0:5:4,45 --> 0:5:7,63
This is what we help the
neighborhood out with.


103
0:5:7,63 --> 0:5:11,9
For the single mums that don't
have as much money as they


104
0:5:11,9 --> 0:5:15,74
would like to, they give us a
bell and we just order them


105
0:5:15,74 --> 0:5:17,31
shopping to their house.


106
0:5:17,31 --> 0:5:19,445
The security on Tesco's
is rubbish.


107
0:5:19,445 --> 0:5:22,3
But I'm happy that it's rubbish,
because it's helped a


108
0:5:22,3 --> 0:5:23,68
lot of people.


109
0:5:23,68 --> 0:5:27,38
So I bought myself shitloads
of DVDs because I want to


110
0:5:27,38 --> 0:5:30,12
start a little pirate
industry.


111
0:5:30,12 --> 0:5:32,36
Give the little youngers
something to do.


112
0:5:32,36 --> 0:5:33,8
This is just pleasurable.


113
0:5:33,8 --> 0:5:36,83
Warhammers, I love this stuff.


114
0:5:36,83 --> 0:5:39,46
Limited edition Warhammers.


115
0:5:39,46 --> 0:5:40,296
Wicked.


116
0:5:40,296 --> 0:5:42,47



117
0:5:42,47 --> 0:5:45,22
I mean, this is just
this week alone.


118
0:5:45,22 --> 0:5:46,922
Welcome to the life of fraud.


119
0:5:46,922 --> 0:5:53,99



120
0:5:53,99 --> 0:5:56,72
TONY SALES: London's full and
diverse of all different types


121
0:5:56,72 --> 0:5:58,95
of frauds going on
continuously.


122
0:5:58,95 --> 0:6:2,11
I think the most bizarre one I
ever heard of and know about


123
0:6:2,11 --> 0:6:6,85
is the Nigerian 419 scam of what
they call black money.


124
0:6:6,85 --> 0:6:9,53
The black money scam just
basically cons people into


125
0:6:9,53 --> 0:6:12,47
believing that there's
a pot of gold at


126
0:6:12,47 --> 0:6:13,72
the end of the rainbow.


127
0:6:13,72 --> 0:6:27,413



128
0:6:27,413 --> 0:6:31,81
MR. GOLD: My name is Mr. Gold,
and I'm here to talk to you


129
0:6:31,81 --> 0:6:34,88
about what we call Wash Wash.


130
0:6:34,88 --> 0:6:37,99
And basically, what I want to
show you now is how we can


131
0:6:37,99 --> 0:6:43,5
turn $300 into maybe $300,000.


132
0:6:43,5 --> 0:6:47,27
Sometimes we've targeted
underworld people because,


133
0:6:47,27 --> 0:6:50,13
number one, they're the only
people who will have a


134
0:6:50,13 --> 0:6:52,91
substantial amount of money
sitting down at home,


135
0:6:52,91 --> 0:6:54,28
unaccounted for.


136
0:6:54,28 --> 0:6:57,19
Yes, we have taken money
from the IRA.


137
0:6:57,19 --> 0:7:1,43
We're not intimidated
by them at all.


138
0:7:1,43 --> 0:7:4,695
Maybe I'll say I'm the assistant
to bin Laden.


139
0:7:4,695 --> 0:7:9,31
I have exclusive access
to his hoard of money.


140
0:7:9,31 --> 0:7:12,98
The job now is to move the money
from where it is to the


141
0:7:12,98 --> 0:7:16,27
West, where it can be
dealt with properly.


142
0:7:16,27 --> 0:7:19,465
But then when I tell them that,
unfortunately, the money


143
0:7:19,465 --> 0:7:21,3
has come defaced.


144
0:7:21,3 --> 0:7:25,18
But it's not an issue, because
this is how security services


145
0:7:25,18 --> 0:7:26,78
normally move the money.


146
0:7:26,78 --> 0:7:29,92
And there are chemicals
available in


147
0:7:29,92 --> 0:7:32,18
order to wash the money.


148
0:7:32,18 --> 0:7:36,44
The idea now is for him to buy
enough chemical so that we can


149
0:7:36,44 --> 0:7:40,13
do his wash by the
end of the week.


150
0:7:40,13 --> 0:7:43,18
We can never tell him what
the secret chemical is.


151
0:7:43,18 --> 0:7:47,9
It's not really expensive, but
we will tell him it's very,


152
0:7:47,9 --> 0:7:48,7
very expensive.


153
0:7:48,7 --> 0:7:51,38
It's only available to
governments, and whatnot.


154
0:7:51,38 --> 0:7:53,16
Magic.


155
0:7:53,16 --> 0:7:54,64
So you give them this.


156
0:7:54,64 --> 0:7:57,79
So, there you go, Mr. Client.


157
0:7:57,79 --> 0:8:1,9
Go down the road, go buy
yourself McDonald's.


158
0:8:1,9 --> 0:8:4,67
By the time they come back,
the chest will be gone,


159
0:8:4,67 --> 0:8:6,77
everything will be gone,
everything will be clean.


160
0:8:6,77 --> 0:8:13,162



161
0:8:13,162 --> 0:8:14,5
Do people actually believe it?


162
0:8:14,5 --> 0:8:15,21
Yes they do.


163
0:8:15,21 --> 0:8:16,62
They believe it.


164
0:8:16,62 --> 0:8:19,4
To be honest with you, I could
not be in the room because I


165
0:8:19,4 --> 0:8:20,37
would laugh.


166
0:8:20,37 --> 0:8:24,7
I've got a nice house, yeah, and
the cars, the women, the


167
0:8:24,7 --> 0:8:25,575
whole shebang.


168
0:8:25,575 --> 0:8:27,89
And it's a lifestyle that
has been bought with


169
0:8:27,89 --> 0:8:30,69
this kind of business.


170
0:8:30,69 --> 0:8:31,94
Cut.


171
0:8:31,94 --> 0:8:52,57



172
0:8:52,57 --> 0:8:55,44
TONY SALES: Key still works.


173
0:8:55,44 --> 0:8:56,69
Let's have a look.


174
0:8:56,69 --> 0:9:2,79



175
0:9:2,79 --> 0:9:9,991
This is just bank statements,
a couple of wage slips,


176
0:9:9,991 --> 0:9:12,86
couples of passports.


177
0:9:12,86 --> 0:9:15,62
Absolutely everything
in there.


178
0:9:15,62 --> 0:9:17,56
Mortgage offers.


179
0:9:17,56 --> 0:9:21,86
A lot of this stuff would have
been given to people at a


180
0:9:21,86 --> 0:9:25,18
proper company to
disperse of it.


181
0:9:25,18 --> 0:9:26,1
You know?


182
0:9:26,1 --> 0:9:29,58
And maybe the guy who drove
the van or works in the


183
0:9:29,58 --> 0:9:31,192
company, who don't get the
wages that he should be


184
0:9:31,192 --> 0:9:35,15
getting for the job that he's
doing, thinks, well, I can


185
0:9:35,15 --> 0:9:36,46
have a little tickle, here.


186
0:9:36,46 --> 0:9:39,21
And he sells it to the wrong
person who then would try and


187
0:9:39,21 --> 0:9:40,92
get hold of someone like me.


188
0:9:40,92 --> 0:9:43,83
This is a mortgage application
in here.


189
0:9:43,83 --> 0:9:45,8
We got a copy of someone's
passport.


190
0:9:45,8 --> 0:9:47,86



191
0:9:47,86 --> 0:9:50,39
We got a copy of someone's
P60, so now we've got a


192
0:9:50,39 --> 0:9:52,9
national insurance number.


193
0:9:52,9 --> 0:9:56,51
We've got Barclay's bank
statements with the account


194
0:9:56,51 --> 0:10:1,21
number, sort code, everything
else on it.


195
0:10:1,21 --> 0:10:2,595
This is how easy it is, yeah?


196
0:10:2,595 --> 0:10:4,93
You make a utility bill.


197
0:10:4,93 --> 0:10:6,99
You can make a national
insurance card, because you


198
0:10:6,99 --> 0:10:8,46
got the national insurance
number.


199
0:10:8,46 --> 0:10:11,3
All these things are really easy
to make once you've got


200
0:10:11,3 --> 0:10:11,85
the right equipment.


201
0:10:11,85 --> 0:10:15,35
So you go into the bank, with
all the stuff that you've made


202
0:10:15,35 --> 0:10:18,71
up now, and you just draw the
money out over the counter.


203
0:10:18,71 --> 0:10:21,26
Once you knew how to do all
this stuff, we was instant


204
0:10:21,26 --> 0:10:21,54
millionaires.


205
0:10:21,54 --> 0:10:24,3
We could have whatever we
wanted, whenever we wanted it.


206
0:10:24,3 --> 0:10:27,9
A4 pieces of paper are cash
if you know how to


207
0:10:27,9 --> 0:10:28,34
make them into money.


208
0:10:28,34 --> 0:10:30,75



209
0:10:30,75 --> 0:10:34,5
The final piece of
the jigsaw is ID.


210
0:10:34,5 --> 0:10:36,59
The best possible form
of ID you can get


211
0:10:36,59 --> 0:10:38,89
is a British passport.


212
0:10:38,89 --> 0:10:41,17
People die on boats and stuff
for this passport.


213
0:10:41,17 --> 0:10:44,76
And they climb over mountains,
and they go everywhere to try


214
0:10:44,76 --> 0:10:46,64
and get this passport
right here.


215
0:10:46,64 --> 0:10:49,48
With this ID, people will
give you anything.


216
0:10:49,48 --> 0:10:50,68
They don't even question it.


217
0:10:50,68 --> 0:10:51,72
And They just look at it.


218
0:10:51,72 --> 0:10:53,47
They'll give you whatever you
want, there and then.


219
0:10:53,47 --> 0:10:54,32
Because as far as they're


220
0:10:54,32 --> 0:10:56,38
concerned, it's a real passport.


221
0:10:56,38 --> 0:10:58,43
If you make it good
enough, no one's


222
0:10:58,43 --> 0:10:59,34
going to question nothing.


223
0:10:59,34 --> 0:11:3,44
So that's the most important
part, is the photo ID.


224
0:11:3,44 --> 0:11:5,5
So that bit's done now.


225
0:11:5,5 --> 0:11:8,36
So now we just need to make the
rest of the utility bills


226
0:11:8,36 --> 0:11:9,61
and the bank statement.


227
0:11:9,61 --> 0:11:11,56
And that's it.


228
0:11:11,56 --> 0:11:15,62
We're going to make a complete
bill with numbers on the back.


229
0:11:15,62 --> 0:11:17,68
Everything it's meant to
have, it's gonna have.


230
0:11:17,68 --> 0:11:19,91
So when people look at it, they
turn it over, it's going


231
0:11:19,91 --> 0:11:21,12
to have all the numbers there.


232
0:11:21,12 --> 0:11:22,27
Everything's in place.


233
0:11:22,27 --> 0:11:25,42
Even the direct debit card
slip is perfect to


234
0:11:25,42 --> 0:11:26,2
how it should be.


235
0:11:26,2 --> 0:11:28,14
There is no difference
whatsoever.


236
0:11:28,14 --> 0:11:29,455
It's absolutely perfect.


237
0:11:29,455 --> 0:11:39,6



238
0:11:39,6 --> 0:11:40,84
People would say it's hard
work, but it's not.


239
0:11:40,84 --> 0:11:42,14
It's an easy thing to do.


240
0:11:42,14 --> 0:11:44,91
Whereas most people walk past
the shop, and they don't see


241
0:11:44,91 --> 0:11:48,7
anything, we're walking past
the shop and thinking, oh,


242
0:11:48,7 --> 0:11:49,6
let's have a little look
in there and just


243
0:11:49,6 --> 0:11:50,37
see what we can do.


244
0:11:50,37 --> 0:11:51,51
SIMMER: She's green.


245
0:11:51,51 --> 0:11:52,3
[INAUDIBLE]


246
0:11:52,3 --> 0:11:53,34
TONY SALES: Look how
young that girl is.


247
0:11:53,34 --> 0:11:54,53
What, she's 20.


248
0:11:54,53 --> 0:11:55,65
What's she going to know?


249
0:11:55,65 --> 0:11:57,27
There's so much [INAUDIBLE]


250
0:11:57,27 --> 0:11:58,72
coming to play.


251
0:11:58,72 --> 0:11:59,47
Do you do finance?


252
0:11:59,47 --> 0:12:0,793
My wife said you do, yeah?


253
0:12:0,793 --> 0:12:2,82
FEMALE SPEAKER: It takes
about 15, 20 minutes


254
0:12:2,82 --> 0:12:4,755
to do on the system.


255
0:12:4,755 --> 0:12:7,46
I just need some form of
identification, preferably


256
0:12:7,46 --> 0:12:8,54
like a debit card.


257
0:12:8,54 --> 0:12:12,6
TONY SALES: Yeah, now these
people are not trained in any


258
0:12:12,6 --> 0:12:16,33
type of financial background
at all.


259
0:12:16,33 --> 0:12:18,23
You can go to them and say, I'd
like to open a store card


260
0:12:18,23 --> 0:12:20,11
today in your store, please.


261
0:12:20,11 --> 0:12:22,54
And they'll say,
OK, thank you.


262
0:12:22,54 --> 0:12:24,59
Could you fill this
form out, sir?


263
0:12:24,59 --> 0:12:25,22
The House of Fraser
store card.


264
0:12:25,22 --> 0:12:27,5
Do you do a House of
Fraser store card?


265
0:12:27,5 --> 0:12:27,92
You do, yeah?


266
0:12:27,92 --> 0:12:30,13
And do I have to have
any ID with me?


267
0:12:30,13 --> 0:12:31,79
FEMALE SPEAKER: We do
need a form of ID,


268
0:12:31,79 --> 0:12:32,275
like a credit card.


269
0:12:32,275 --> 0:12:33,76
TONY SALES : All right,
I've got that, yeah.


270
0:12:33,76 --> 0:12:34,7
Yeah, that's fine.


271
0:12:34,7 --> 0:12:35,935
That's fine, yeah?


272
0:12:35,935 --> 0:12:37,39
All right.


273
0:12:37,39 --> 0:12:38,3
Thank you very much!


274
0:12:38,3 --> 0:12:40,3
SIMMER: They want you to take
it more than they think you


275
0:12:40,3 --> 0:12:41,15
want to take it.


276
0:12:41,15 --> 0:12:42,36
So just let them
sell it to you.


277
0:12:42,36 --> 0:12:44,12
TONY SALES : Hello.


278
0:12:44,12 --> 0:12:45,28
I was just making some
inquiries, really.


279
0:12:45,28 --> 0:12:48,245
I see you do up to three years'
interest-free credit.


280
0:12:48,245 --> 0:12:49,25
FEMALE SPEAKER: Yes.


281
0:12:49,25 --> 0:12:51,23
TONY SALES : I'm looking to
get my wife a 10 year


282
0:12:51,23 --> 0:12:52,308
anniversary present.


283
0:12:52,308 --> 0:12:54,26
Yeah, that looks all right.


284
0:12:54,26 --> 0:12:56,212
FEMALE SPEAKER: That's a
nice-looking watch, isn't it?


285
0:12:56,212 --> 0:12:57,188
TONY SALES : Yeah.


286
0:12:57,188 --> 0:12:59,14
FEMALE SPEAKER: Marital
status?


287
0:12:59,14 --> 0:13:0,604
You're married, yeah?


288
0:13:0,604 --> 0:13:1,58
10 years, was it?


289
0:13:1,58 --> 0:13:2,556
TONY SALES : 10 years, yeah.


290
0:13:2,556 --> 0:13:3,62
FEMALE SPEAKER: Same
as me, this year.


291
0:13:3,62 --> 0:13:4,1
TONY SALES : Oh yeah?


292
0:13:4,1 --> 0:13:6,238
Well you don't look old enough
to be married 10 years.


293
0:13:6,238 --> 0:13:7,19
FEMALE SPEAKER: 10
years, July.


294
0:13:7,19 --> 0:13:7,91
TONY SALES : Wow.


295
0:13:7,91 --> 0:13:9,88
FEMALE SPEAKER: Do you
have any proof of


296
0:13:9,88 --> 0:13:13,0
residence at all with you?


297
0:13:13,0 --> 0:13:14,166
Driving license or
utility bill?


298
0:13:14,166 --> 0:13:16,226
TONY SALES : I've got
a utility bill.


299
0:13:16,226 --> 0:13:17,158
Yeah.


300
0:13:17,158 --> 0:13:19,22
I've left one bit in the car.


301
0:13:19,22 --> 0:13:19,954
[LAUGHS]


302
0:13:19,954 --> 0:13:20,42
Here you go.


303
0:13:20,42 --> 0:13:22,9
Thanks.


304
0:13:22,9 --> 0:13:24,4
They haven't got a clue what
they're looking at, what ID


305
0:13:24,4 --> 0:13:26,5
they're looking at, how
to check to see if the


306
0:13:26,5 --> 0:13:27,78
ID is real or not.


307
0:13:27,78 --> 0:13:29,96
They don't have a clue.


308
0:13:29,96 --> 0:13:33,54
And that person could issue you
up to 5,000 pound credit


309
0:13:33,54 --> 0:13:34,75
on the spot, there and then.


310
0:13:34,75 --> 0:13:38,72
MALE SPEAKER: Right, you have
six autographs in total, sir.


311
0:13:38,72 --> 0:13:39,68
Signature there.


312
0:13:39,68 --> 0:13:41,375
Signature and dates
on that one.


313
0:13:41,375 --> 0:13:43,1
And there's three copies
of it, basically.


314
0:13:43,1 --> 0:13:44,68
One for me, one for [INAUDIBLE],
and one for us.


315
0:13:44,68 --> 0:13:45,67
TONY SALES : OK, sir.


316
0:13:45,67 --> 0:13:46,97
I'll go and get the card.


317
0:13:46,97 --> 0:13:50,556
I've got to do a couple little
bits just down there, yeah.


318
0:13:50,556 --> 0:13:51,966
MALE SPEAKER: We'll have the
watch ready, we'll have all


319
0:13:51,966 --> 0:13:52,97
this done, all the
paperwork sorted.


320
0:13:52,97 --> 0:13:54,46
TONY SALES : Thank you, sir.


321
0:13:54,46 --> 0:13:55,71
Thank you very much.


322
0:13:55,71 --> 0:13:58,6



323
0:13:58,6 --> 0:14:0,73
See you later, bye bye.


324
0:14:0,73 --> 0:14:4,77
On one day, it could be that
there might be 20 of us out.


325
0:14:4,77 --> 0:14:8,6
And that girl does 20
applications in one day.


326
0:14:8,6 --> 0:14:13,9
That poor girl is going
to get in trouble.


327
0:14:13,9 --> 0:14:16,92
SIMMER: Before I met Tony,
I used to do robberies.


328
0:14:16,92 --> 0:14:19,42
I was robbing doorstep
collection people.


329
0:14:19,42 --> 0:14:21,13
I was getting in so
much trouble.


330
0:14:21,13 --> 0:14:24,68
Prison, police stations,
[INAUDIBLE].


331
0:14:24,68 --> 0:14:28,21
It just got progressively
worse.


332
0:14:28,21 --> 0:14:30,17
It was wearing a bit thin.


333
0:14:30,17 --> 0:14:31,13
I could see a long prison
sentence coming out of


334
0:14:31,13 --> 0:14:31,76
something like that.


335
0:14:31,76 --> 0:14:32,86
I just met Hott.


336
0:14:32,86 --> 0:14:35,7
And he just showed me a
different way where I wasn't


337
0:14:35,7 --> 0:14:36,64
getting into trouble so much.


338
0:14:36,64 --> 0:14:39,3
He just brought me in like
it was just an old


339
0:14:39,3 --> 0:14:40,39
family sort of thing.


340
0:14:40,39 --> 0:14:42,8
It was just an easy
way of life.


341
0:14:42,8 --> 0:14:43,38
I didn't worry about nothing.


342
0:14:43,38 --> 0:14:44,94
I didn't have to worry
about money.


343
0:14:44,94 --> 0:14:47,17
Nice clothes, whatever
I wanted.


344
0:14:47,17 --> 0:14:49,25
Growing up, I never used to
have nothing like that.


345
0:14:49,25 --> 0:14:52,27
When I stopped robbing and
started doing the fraud, it


346
0:14:52,27 --> 0:14:56,2
was taking the face away from
the crime, if you like.


347
0:14:56,2 --> 0:14:58,29
Wasn't hurting nobody
indirectly.


348
0:14:58,29 --> 0:14:59,4
It's luck of the draw.


349
0:14:59,4 --> 0:15:1,57
Because what you do is you're
picking people.


350
0:15:1,57 --> 0:15:2,78
You don't know the people
you're picking.


351
0:15:2,78 --> 0:15:5,6
You might have a million people,
and all you're doing


352
0:15:5,6 --> 0:15:7,92
is just picking the best name
that suits yourself.


353
0:15:7,92 --> 0:15:9,67
It's already happened
to my mother.


354
0:15:9,67 --> 0:15:12,79
She was the victim of
identification fraud, as well.


355
0:15:12,79 --> 0:15:15,9
Not saying that come from none
of us, because it never come


356
0:15:15,9 --> 0:15:16,43
from none of us.


357
0:15:16,43 --> 0:15:17,6
But she was.


358
0:15:17,6 --> 0:15:19,885
My family didn't want me
to go the way I did.


359
0:15:19,885 --> 0:15:21,48
But you take your own path
in life, don't you?


360
0:15:21,48 --> 0:15:24,372



361
0:15:24,372 --> 0:15:26,19
TONY SALES: Like in a
football team, the


362
0:15:26,19 --> 0:15:27,75
striker scores the goal.


363
0:15:27,75 --> 0:15:30,2
Fraud works in exactly the same
way where at the end,


364
0:15:30,2 --> 0:15:33,79
sometimes you build everything
up, and you just need the last


365
0:15:33,79 --> 0:15:36,18
part of the jigsaw puzzle
to put it together.


366
0:15:36,18 --> 0:15:38,25
9 times out of 10, that'll
be someone like Kelly.


367
0:15:38,25 --> 0:15:41,11



368
0:15:41,11 --> 0:15:42,46
Men are men.


369
0:15:42,46 --> 0:15:45,9
They will look at a gorgeous
young girl, and they go weak


370
0:15:45,9 --> 0:15:47,56
at the knees.


371
0:15:47,56 --> 0:15:50,5
I can go in and corrupt the
girls behind the counter.


372
0:15:50,5 --> 0:15:53,22
But there's a lot more men
working stores, and it's


373
0:15:53,22 --> 0:15:57,27
easier for her to go in,
flash her boobs, wink--


374
0:15:57,27 --> 0:15:59,29
make the guy feel that
he's special.


375
0:15:59,29 --> 0:16:1,776
So she'll come out with 10 times
more than what I can


376
0:16:1,776 --> 0:16:2,17
come out with.


377
0:16:2,17 --> 0:16:4,89
KELLY: Listen, I'll go out
some little Geary.


378
0:16:4,89 --> 0:16:6,61
He must be about eighteen.


379
0:16:6,61 --> 0:16:10,4
And I'll mug him right off.


380
0:16:10,4 --> 0:16:12,71



381
0:16:12,71 --> 0:16:16,595
I will use my, what's the
word, femininity.


382
0:16:16,595 --> 0:16:17,22
TONY SALES: Femininity.


383
0:16:17,22 --> 0:16:18,5
KELLY: [LAUGHS]


384
0:16:18,5 --> 0:16:19,5
How do you say it?


385
0:16:19,5 --> 0:16:20,5
TONY SALES: Femininity.


386
0:16:20,5 --> 0:16:21,3
KELLY: Femininity.


387
0:16:21,3 --> 0:16:23,41



388
0:16:23,41 --> 0:16:24,64
I will use that.


389
0:16:24,64 --> 0:16:25,95
Oh, please.


390
0:16:25,95 --> 0:16:27,45
At the end of the
day, love, I've


391
0:16:27,45 --> 0:16:31,22
never, ever robbed anybody.


392
0:16:31,22 --> 0:16:37,91
If I could get 50 grand off some
silly bank, because I've


393
0:16:37,91 --> 0:16:41,31
got a bit of paperwork,
whatever,


394
0:16:41,31 --> 0:16:42,35
I'm happy to do that.


395
0:16:42,35 --> 0:16:47,51
I won't get out of
my bed for 5,000.


396
0:16:47,51 --> 0:16:47,71
Would I?


397
0:16:47,71 --> 0:16:48,151
[LAUGHS]


398
0:16:48,151 --> 0:16:50,36
TONY SALES: No, you wouldn't.


399
0:16:50,36 --> 0:16:51,39
You love money too much, man.


400
0:16:51,39 --> 0:16:54,1
KELLY: (LAUGHING) I wouldn't
get out of my bed for it.


401
0:16:54,1 --> 0:16:57,2
TONY SALES: You know, in that
game sometimes people, when


402
0:16:57,2 --> 0:16:59,38
they get a bit nervous, they
turn to drink or drugs to just


403
0:16:59,38 --> 0:17:1,31
sort of calm their nerves
a little bit.


404
0:17:1,31 --> 0:17:3,66
I think sometimes, a lot of what
happens with these people


405
0:17:3,66 --> 0:17:5,929
is that they've earned so much
money in the past, and they've


406
0:17:5,929 --> 0:17:9,13
had such a good life,
that things start to


407
0:17:9,13 --> 0:17:11,44
spiral out of control.


408
0:17:11,44 --> 0:17:15,55
Before you know it, the party
lifestyle is trying to


409
0:17:15,55 --> 0:17:16,8
happen every day.


410
0:17:16,8 --> 0:17:29,4



411
0:17:29,4 --> 0:17:29,55
Dave?


412
0:17:29,55 --> 0:17:31,17
DAVE: Goddamn!


413
0:17:31,17 --> 0:17:32,12
Tony, come here.


414
0:17:32,12 --> 0:17:33,42
TONY SALES: Hey, how
you doing, mate?


415
0:17:33,42 --> 0:17:34,5
You all right?


416
0:17:34,5 --> 0:17:35,42
Yeah, mate, I'm all right.


417
0:17:35,42 --> 0:17:35,99
You all right?


418
0:17:35,99 --> 0:17:36,51
This is Dave.


419
0:17:36,51 --> 0:17:38,47
DAVE COURTNEY: I do apologize
about him.


420
0:17:38,47 --> 0:17:39,923
I was right from the start.


421
0:17:39,923 --> 0:17:42,56
I blame the parent.


422
0:17:42,56 --> 0:17:42,78
I've known him a long time.


423
0:17:42,78 --> 0:17:45,24
When I first met him,
I had a fringe.


424
0:17:45,24 --> 0:17:49,7
This is one of the local heroes
of our little block.


425
0:17:49,7 --> 0:17:51,57
Right?


426
0:17:51,57 --> 0:17:55,1
He was always, and I mean this
most sincerely, a little bit


427
0:17:55,1 --> 0:17:57,19
smarter than your average
bear, Boo-Boo, right?


428
0:17:57,19 --> 0:18:0,4
He was a little bit
above his years.


429
0:18:0,4 --> 0:18:0,4
TONY SALES: Thank you.


430
0:18:0,4 --> 0:18:1,78
DAVE COURTNEY: No, I
don't mean it nice.


431
0:18:1,78 --> 0:18:2,81
I looked at you as a threat.


432
0:18:2,81 --> 0:18:3,61
I hated him.


433
0:18:3,61 --> 0:18:4,25
I hated him.


434
0:18:4,25 --> 0:18:6,16
[INAUDIBLE] talking to him
[INAUDIBLE] a fancy smile.


435
0:18:6,16 --> 0:18:9,94



436
0:18:9,94 --> 0:18:12,92
Come on, you mastermind.


437
0:18:12,92 --> 0:18:14,65
Now, I don't have to be
the best fraudster.


438
0:18:14,65 --> 0:18:15,98
'Cause I know him.


439
0:18:15,98 --> 0:18:17,24
And he don't have to be
the best fighter,


440
0:18:17,24 --> 0:18:18,7
because he can ring me.


441
0:18:18,7 --> 0:18:19,78
Each to his own.


442
0:18:19,78 --> 0:18:21,68
Horses for courses, right
peg in the right hole.


443
0:18:21,68 --> 0:18:23,16
I'm a completely
different era.


444
0:18:23,16 --> 0:18:26,83
And the only way to be against
the law, or criminal, in them


445
0:18:26,83 --> 0:18:28,89
days, you all had the same
haircut, you all had the flat


446
0:18:28,89 --> 0:18:32,21
nose, and you was a gangster,
you understand what I mean?


447
0:18:32,21 --> 0:18:34,5
Now, as the world has evolved,
everyone's got a little bit


448
0:18:34,5 --> 0:18:35,9
more sharper.


449
0:18:35,9 --> 0:18:37,34
You couldn't rob a bank.


450
0:18:37,34 --> 0:18:38,49
It wouldn't be worth it.


451
0:18:38,49 --> 0:18:39,38
Because everyone's paying
with a check.


452
0:18:39,38 --> 0:18:42,166
And when I used to do it, some
old woman used to give you 200


453
0:18:42,166 --> 0:18:43,44
grand, and we'd run
off down the road.


454
0:18:43,44 --> 0:18:44,38
And if you was unlucky,
a cop would


455
0:18:44,38 --> 0:18:46,34
chase you with a whistle.


456
0:18:46,34 --> 0:18:47,78
It was fucking mental.


457
0:18:47,78 --> 0:18:51,11
Their criminal mind
is so sharp.


458
0:18:51,11 --> 0:18:52,97
They'll crucifying and
slaughtering these failsafe


459
0:18:52,97 --> 0:18:56,73
things that they're doing
within hours.


460
0:18:56,73 --> 0:18:57,71
How could I get away
with fraud?


461
0:18:57,71 --> 0:18:59,132
Look at me.


462
0:18:59,132 --> 0:19:0,27
Stop it.


463
0:19:0,27 --> 0:19:2,73
Criminals spend their money
very, very fast, because they


464
0:19:2,73 --> 0:19:6,35
do not understand the
concept of saving.


465
0:19:6,35 --> 0:19:9,27
And when you run out of money,
you just then go out


466
0:19:9,27 --> 0:19:10,44
and nick some more.


467
0:19:10,44 --> 0:19:11,63
So you don't have to
do the saving.


468
0:19:11,63 --> 0:19:13,34
You know what I mean?


469
0:19:13,34 --> 0:19:17,4
Although you might not want to
be squanderous and slap-happy


470
0:19:17,4 --> 0:19:18,44
with your money, you
can't help it.


471
0:19:18,44 --> 0:19:20,805
Because it's easy
come, easy go.


472
0:19:20,805 --> 0:19:22,99
And I hate to say that,
but it is like that.


473
0:19:22,99 --> 0:19:26,243
Very much so in Tony's case,
with the fraud thing.


474
0:19:26,243 --> 0:19:29,77
He never, ever believed that
that was ever going to stop.


475
0:19:29,77 --> 0:19:32,85
Otherwise he wouldn't have
wasted the money he did on


476
0:19:32,85 --> 0:19:33,89
what he did.


477
0:19:33,89 --> 0:19:35,73
He must have thought this
would go on forever.


478
0:19:35,73 --> 0:19:38,55



479
0:19:38,55 --> 0:19:39,8
TONY SALES: [INAUDIBLE]


480
0:19:39,8 --> 0:19:44,62



481
0:19:44,62 --> 0:19:47,555
[MAKING GUN NOISES]


482
0:19:47,555 --> 0:19:48,43
DAVE COURTNEY: Come then.


483
0:19:48,43 --> 0:19:49,355
Next!


484
0:19:49,355 --> 0:19:51,44
Yeah, but I can't
make a passport.


485
0:19:51,44 --> 0:19:53,293
I couldn't walk out of a
fucking [INAUDIBLE] in


486
0:19:53,293 --> 0:19:54,22
[INAUDIBLE].


487
0:19:54,22 --> 0:19:57,154
Unless I went like that, give
me the fucking, give me the


488
0:19:57,154 --> 0:19:57,856
fucking [INAUDIBLE].


489
0:19:57,856 --> 0:19:58,558
Know what I mean?


490
0:19:58,558 --> 0:19:59,728
How's that for a fraud?


491
0:19:59,728 --> 0:20:0,978
Boom.


492
0:20:0,978 --> 0:20:11,68



493
0:20:11,68 --> 0:20:13,19
I'm rubbing my cock
on her ankle.


494
0:20:13,19 --> 0:20:15,15
I'm rubbing my cock
on her ankle.


495
0:20:15,15 --> 0:20:17,69
The illusion that anyone that's
on the wrong side of


496
0:20:17,69 --> 0:20:21,1
the law is more exciting is an
illusion, but it definitely is


497
0:20:21,1 --> 0:20:22,61
an aphrodisiac.


498
0:20:22,61 --> 0:20:24,53
These little creatures, here,
that look like they walked off


499
0:20:24,53 --> 0:20:27,49
the front of a magazine wouldn't
be sitting in my back


500
0:20:27,49 --> 0:20:31,46
garden, letting me molest her
ankle if I was a milkman.


501
0:20:31,46 --> 0:20:35,94
They make me feel like I'm 25,
about 6'8", and Jamaican.


502
0:20:35,94 --> 0:20:38,98



503
0:20:38,98 --> 0:20:39,49
Step this way.


504
0:20:39,49 --> 0:20:40,88
Look.


505
0:20:40,88 --> 0:20:41,8
After you.


506
0:20:41,8 --> 0:20:43,34
Listen, God didn't give
you a bum like that


507
0:20:43,34 --> 0:20:44,118
to walk behind me.


508
0:20:44,118 --> 0:20:45,368
Fucking hell.


509
0:20:45,368 --> 0:20:56,81



510
0:20:56,81 --> 0:20:59,22
I'm loving the way your
legs bend, blondie.


511
0:20:59,22 --> 0:21:2,69
I'm liking that little
bend you do.


512
0:21:2,69 --> 0:21:6,26
FLORA: I can tell the difference
between gangsters


513
0:21:6,26 --> 0:21:11,3
and them sort of straight guys,
just even down to the


514
0:21:11,3 --> 0:21:14,1
way they talk a lot of the time,
and the words they use.


515
0:21:14,1 --> 0:21:17,202
DAVE COURTNEY: Oh, your
fucking legs!


516
0:21:17,202 --> 0:21:18,645
[LAUGHS]


517
0:21:18,645 --> 0:21:22,37
FLORA: I just have that side to
me that finds it attractive


518
0:21:22,37 --> 0:21:25,675
or feels excited by them.


519
0:21:25,675 --> 0:21:27,39
It's not like I were
used to that.


520
0:21:27,39 --> 0:21:29,84
Like when I was a teenager,
when I was a kid, I was


521
0:21:29,84 --> 0:21:32,6
completely innocent.


522
0:21:32,6 --> 0:21:34,23
I didn't think, oh, I want
to hang around gangsters.


523
0:21:34,23 --> 0:21:36,875
It was just something that
happened, really.


524
0:21:36,875 --> 0:21:43,12
I prefer the fraud side of
crime, more than anything


525
0:21:43,12 --> 0:21:45,34
else, like violence and drugs.


526
0:21:45,34 --> 0:21:46,39
It is more clever.


527
0:21:46,39 --> 0:21:49,95
It's finding loopholes
in today's society.


528
0:21:49,95 --> 0:21:52,74
Because on both sides you've got
people that are making a


529
0:21:52,74 --> 0:21:54,57
lot of money.


530
0:21:54,57 --> 0:21:57,85
And if everyday people can use
their brain enough to find a


531
0:21:57,85 --> 0:22:0,86
way to look after their kids
lovely, their girlfriend


532
0:22:0,86 --> 0:22:4,455
lovely, make a nice house,
sometimes I do think, well,


533
0:22:4,455 --> 0:22:4,89
good on to you.


534
0:22:4,89 --> 0:22:8,23
You've put enough brain power
into it, you've made things


535
0:22:8,23 --> 0:22:9,48
happen out of nothing.


536
0:22:9,48 --> 0:22:13,27
And it might be bad to say,
but I guess I don't


537
0:22:13,27 --> 0:22:14,49
mind that too much.


538
0:22:14,49 --> 0:22:17,91
I know that I've had friends
that have had their identity


539
0:22:17,91 --> 0:22:20,57
stolen and their
banks cleared.


540
0:22:20,57 --> 0:22:23,16
So they will probably
hate me for that.


541
0:22:23,16 --> 0:22:24,345
And I know that's really bad.


542
0:22:24,345 --> 0:22:29,38
But fraud is more commendable?


543
0:22:29,38 --> 0:22:33,44
DAVE COURTNEY: It's our duty
as a criminal, as soon as


544
0:22:33,44 --> 0:22:35,36
you're doing something that the
rest of the world don't


545
0:22:35,36 --> 0:22:38,45
like, which is crime, you should
at least do it with as


546
0:22:38,45 --> 0:22:43,0
much dignity, honor, respect,
class, quality,


547
0:22:43,0 --> 0:22:45,2
professionalism, as possible.


548
0:22:45,2 --> 0:22:47,85
Because what you're doing
is scummy, so at


549
0:22:47,85 --> 0:22:50,94
least do it with honor.


550
0:22:50,94 --> 0:22:52,19
That'll be a nice one.


551
0:22:52,19 --> 0:22:54,47



552
0:22:54,47 --> 0:22:55,92
Alright, thanks a lot,
ladies and gentlemen,


553
0:22:55,92 --> 0:22:56,34
thank you very much.


554
0:22:56,34 --> 0:22:58,294
The Courtney Show is over.


555
0:22:58,294 --> 0:23:1,102



556
0:23:1,102 --> 0:23:2,35
TONY SALES: I did
tell you that.


557
0:23:2,35 --> 0:23:3,17
You don't listen to me.


558
0:23:3,17 --> 0:23:4,7
I told you the other day.


559
0:23:4,7 --> 0:23:4,625
MINDY: You didn't tell me.


560
0:23:4,625 --> 0:23:5,66
TONY SALES: I'm not
arguing with you.


561
0:23:5,66 --> 0:23:6,492
MINDY: You were out
last Saturday.


562
0:23:6,492 --> 0:23:9,148
TONY SALES: What are
you, my mum?


563
0:23:9,148 --> 0:23:11,528
MINDY: No, I'm your fucking
wife that's sitting here


564
0:23:11,528 --> 0:23:13,432
looking after your children.


565
0:23:13,432 --> 0:23:14,384
That's what.


566
0:23:14,384 --> 0:23:15,692
TONY SALES: Yeah, please,
babe, can you do


567
0:23:15,692 --> 0:23:16,942
that for me, yeah?


568
0:23:16,942 --> 0:23:19,39



569
0:23:19,39 --> 0:23:20,37
Mindy?


570
0:23:20,37 --> 0:23:21,708
I think she's gone now.


571
0:23:21,708 --> 0:23:23,492
[LAUGHTER]


572
0:23:23,492 --> 0:23:26,71
TONY SALES: There's
my son, there.


573
0:23:26,71 --> 0:23:27,96
There's my little boy.


574
0:23:27,96 --> 0:23:33,88



575
0:23:33,88 --> 0:23:34,985
This is where I live now.


576
0:23:34,985 --> 0:23:37,77
I've obviously moved on from
the big houses and the big


577
0:23:37,77 --> 0:23:39,5
cars and stuff.


578
0:23:39,5 --> 0:23:42,7
Now I'm trying to change my
life around and go legit.


579
0:23:42,7 --> 0:23:44,21
It's a lot harder than
when you're just


580
0:23:44,21 --> 0:23:46,26
taking stuff for free.


581
0:23:46,26 --> 0:23:49,79
The thought of going and getting
it for financial gain


582
0:23:49,79 --> 0:23:52,15
doesn't bother me in
the slightest.


583
0:23:52,15 --> 0:23:57,64
But actually deceiving my wife
and my family is the one thing


584
0:23:57,64 --> 0:24:0,37
that got to me more
than anything.


585
0:24:0,37 --> 0:24:1,65
Born on the same day as me.


586
0:24:1,65 --> 0:24:4,29



587
0:24:4,29 --> 0:24:5,15
He's a good boy, though.


588
0:24:5,15 --> 0:24:6,8
He's not going to be
