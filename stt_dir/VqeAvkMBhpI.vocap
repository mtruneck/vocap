###6 MATHEUS VARGAS (through translator): I was at the door of the club as soon as the fire
###16 started. I saw people shouting "Fire! Fire!" They were terrified. When I realized that
###21 there was fire, I rushed out of there.
###23 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###24 CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: Fire he is talking about is the one at the nightclub in Brazil
###27 over the weekend, and that last thing he said about rushing out is really important, because
###32 experts say that when a crisis happens, every second counts. When you`re in a crowded place
###36 like a club or a theater, there are some thing you can do to be ready for an emergency.
###40 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###41 STEVE ALMASY, CNN PRODUCER/WRITER: Thanks, Carl. We talked to some fire protection and
###44 life safety experts this week after the fire in Brazil. And what they told us is, there
###49 are two things that are very important when you are going to a venue or whether it`s a
###53 public event. And that`s preparation and don`t hesitate if there`s an emergency. But another
###59 thing they told us is, before you even go, make a plan with your friends where you`re
###64 going to meet in case something happens. It might be the car, it might be a public transit
###67 stop, it might have to be some place else in case the parking lot is too busy, or you
###72 can`t get to your car because it`s blocked. So, what you do is like, say, you`re going
###76 to a movie theater or you go to a night club, identify who the workers there are, they might
###83 be wearing a particular color shirt. You might ask them where the extra exits are, or if
###87 they are unavailable to do that, then go, take a lap around, or if you`re sitting in
###92 the movie theater, look around to see where the extra exits are, because if an emergency
###96 happens, most people are going to head out the way they came in, that`s what`s familiar
###100 to them, and people tend to stick with that. If you familiarize yourself with the alternate
###104 exits, then that`s the way you`re going to go, if you can in case there`s an emergency.
###109 Now, if you hear a fire alarm, don`t hesitate. Head for the exits. One expert told me, it`s
###115 those ten seconds that can cost you your life. So head for the door, if you can`t see, because
###121 the smoke is coming down, or it`s too sick, then feel your way forward, go in a straight
###125 line until you hit a wall. When you hit the wall, then you`re going to take your hand
###129 and you`re going to follow it around until you get to maybe a door or you get to a window.
###133 (END VIDEOTAPE)
###134 AZUZ: Brazil is going through three days of morning for the hundreds of people killed
###138 in that night club. Police have arrested several people in connection with the fire, those
###142 people are being held temporarily, five days to start with. Authorities say they need to
###147 do that in order to get more information for their investigation.

###151 CESAR VALDEZ, UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANT: I went to the registering office, and they just let
###157 me know, you know, you`re undocumented, the laws have changed, you can`t register.
###163 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###166 AZUZ: Undocumented immigrants like Cesar Valdez aren`t allowed to join the military because
###171 they are living in the U.S. illegally. Cesar isn`t alone, there are about 11 million undocumented
###177 immigrants in the United States. A group of senators want to give them the chance to stay
###181 here legally.
###182 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
###183 SEN. CHARLES SCHUMER, (D), NEW YORK: We believe this will be the year Congress finally gets
###188 it done. The politics on this issue have been turned upside down. For the first time ever,
###195 there`s more political risk in opposing immigration reform than in supporting it.
###200 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###201 AZUZ: That was Senator Charles Schumer. He is one of eight senators, four Democrats and
###205 four Republicans, who announced an immigration reform plan yesterday. It includes things
###210 like overhauling the country`s legal immigration system and creating a path to citizenship
###216 for undocumented immigrants. Critics sometimes call that last part "amnesty". U.S. Representative
###221 Lamar Smith said it would make the situation worse.
###224 "When you legalize those who are in the country illegally, he says, it costs taxpayers millions
###230 of dollars, costs American workers thousands of jobs and encourages more illegal immigration.
###236 By granting amnesty, the Senate proposal actually compounds the problem by encouraging more
###241 illegal immigration." We`re going to have more on this issue for you this week. The
###245 president is set to talk about it, and you can always get the latest details at cnn.com.
###249 You`ve heard it over and over again, higher education can mean higher pay. Here`s proof
###256 from cnnmoney. Without a high school diploma, Americans earn an average of $478 a week.
###262 It works out to about $25,000. But if you do get your diploma, look at the jump to $647
###268 a week, or more than $33,000 a year. Going for a bachelor`s degree, you are likely to
###274 pull down more than a thousand dollars a week, or over $55,000 a year. And a higher degree
###280 than that can spill out more than 1300 a week, or over 71,000 a year. Keep in mind, higher
###287 education doesn`t necessarily mean a four year college degree. If you go in a construction,
###293 for instance, you may need to go to trade school or get a formal apprenticeship, and
###297 you can average $740 a week or a little under $40,000 a year. Some registered nurses and
###303 dental hygienists who may have associates degrees, can earn between $65 and $70,000
###309 a year. So the take away here, if you`re hoping to make more money, is to make sure your education
###314 doesn`t stop at high school.

###317 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It`s time for "The Shoutout." "Parents can only give good advice or put
###323 them on the right path, but the final forming of a person`s character lies in their own
###327 hands." Now, who said that? Was it Benjamin Franklin, Anne Frank, Mohandas Gandhi, or
###334 Justin Bieber? You`ve got three seconds, go!
###341 Anne Frank wrote these words in her famous diary. That`s your answer and that`s your
###349 "Shoutout."
###349 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###351 AZUZ: People showing their character is what our next two stories are about. First one,
###355 from a restaurant in Houston. This is Milo (ph). He`s five years old, and he has Down
###360 syndrome. Heno`s family went out to dinner recently. When they sat down, the family in
###365 the next booth reportedly got up and moved tables. Milo`s mom didn`t really know why,
###371 but the waiter heard the family that moved to say this.
###374 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
###375 MICHAEL GARCIA, WAITER: Special needs children need to be special somewhere else. That`s
###380 like saying you can`t come in here because you have a different skin color.
###383 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###384 AZUZ: Saying goes that the customer is always right, but Michael Garcia decided what he
###388 heard was wrong. He stood up for Milo and refused to serve the other customers who walked
###393 out. And the owners backed up the waiter and said Michael made the right call.
###398 These three guys are high school seniors, Zick, Jesse and Drew. They were all up for
###403 homecoming king. Jesse, the guy in the middle, won, except he didn`t. None of them did, because
###409 they al thought that Scotty, the student you see here, should get the crown. Reporter Jamey
###414 Tucker with the CNN affiliate in Tennessee tells you what happened.
###417 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###418 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Scott is loved by everyone in school.
###421 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Scott will make a gloomy day bright.
###423 JAMEY TUCKER, WHNT TV CORRESPONDENT: Scottie Maloney, a high school junior, Community High
###426 in Unionville, born with William`s Syndrome, a neurological disorder that inhibits speech
###432 and learning, but often, and in Scottie`s case, makes people who have it, abundantly
###436 friendly and happy.
###438 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He`s a star of this school. A lot of us look up to him.
###442 TUCKER: Seniors Zig Grissam (ph), Drew Gibbs and Jesse Cooper were nominees for the school`s
###447 homecoming king. But before the votes were counted, they came up with an unselfish idea.
###452 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He is always happy. So he deserves some recognition for who he is.
###457 TUCKER: With the entire school and most of the community watching Scottie was named homecoming
###462 king.
###462 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I`ve seen (inaudible) before, but I didn`t think it could quite drop (ph)
###465 that much.
###466 TUCKER: And for the next 30 seconds, the crowd gave Scottie a standing ovation.
###471 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It was a ton of emotion just from everybody. I think I saw Scottie
###477 show a few tears, you know, Jesse was pretty emotional. I mean we`re all emotional out
###481 there on the court.
###481 TUCKER (on camera): It means an awful lot to you, brother.
###486 SCOTTIE MALONEY: Yes.
###487 TUCKER: Scottie hasn`t taken his medal from around his neck, and may not, for a long time.
###491 Homecoming king is a high point in one senior year, but really, who remembers after a few
###497 years.
###497 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I wouldn`t wear it to school every day, I would put it on my shelf and
###500 say, I got that, thanks, everybody, for voting for me. And him, he`s so passionate about
###505 it.
###505 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You know, every time we get together, hey, you remember when Scottie
###507 won a homecoming king, and we always look back and cherish that.
###512 MALONEY: Thank you.
###513 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: You`re welcome, Scottie.
###514 (END VIDEOTAPE)
###515 AZUZ: Well, whether it`s Michael Garcia standing up for Milo, or those seniors giving Scottie
###519 the memory of a lifetime, people put character on display all the time. Have you stood up
###525 for someone? Do you know someone who has? Go to our blog at cnnstudentnews.com, talk

###531 Which came first - the chicken or the egg? This Youtube video just doesn`t help clear
###536 things up.
###537 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
###538 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: That`s (inaudible) of a normal one, not (inaudible), is the one that
###542 has come out more chicken. It`s nearly - nearly ten inches round.
###550 (LAUGHTER)
###551 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Oh, my God.
###555 UNIDENTIFIED CHILD: What is that?
###558 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Shut up.
###561 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###563 AZUZ: An egg inside of an egg - scramble your brain. If you want to eggsplain that mystery,
###569 you just have to crack the case. But in the end, the yokes on you, because it`s all just
###574 a show game. For CNN STUDENT NEWS, I`m Carl Azuz. We`ll see you tomorrow.
