###0 because a week elise that we find out more information about what we've done
###3 in iraq of course millions of documents were released uh... the reason bramley
###7 manning faces at least twenty years maybe more up to a life sentence
###12 uh... is because the get heat revealed information the government did you want
###16 you know it's arleigh secrets
###17 well the guardian has done a terrific
###20 piece along with bbc
###22 uh... headache
###24 at that
###25 shows exactly what we're off to his ad features two guys colonel james
###29 kaufman retired and colonel james still retired
###34 they were quite retired because they went back into iraq and work with
###37 general petraeus
###39 and the rest of our forces
###40 to help the iraqis set up special police commandos
###44 now those
###45 special police units
###47 one-up doing a tremendous amount of torture
###49 and oh by the way some desk once
###51 in fact at the height of the civil war in iraq
###55 three thousand people were showing up dead
###58 every single moms
###62 are was name enough to believe at the time
###64 that hey listen we open up that pandora's box so we were responsible for
###68 what happened afterwards
###70 but i didn't think that we actually participated in
###73 well it turns out that we at least gave tacit approval and oftentimes active
###77 approval
###79 for exactly some of the most hideous things
###81 that were being done in iraq
###83 and when you see that
###84 district colonel james till you begin to understand why
###88 first of all he was the same exact i we sat down the el salvador
###93 to set up the
###94 death squads there
###96 and guess what i have an el salvador
###98 a tremendous civil war just like in iraq
###101 where there are desk was and then retaliation
###104 and ambitious cycle of violence so why not repeat that mistake in fact
###109 celebrated castio as a senior d_e_a_ agent
###112 when he got that still was characterized another office of the hour on spoke his
###116 reset
###117 i first heard about colonel james still gonna rock and i said
###121 they're gonna implement what is known
###122 as a salvadoran option in iraq
###125 and that's exactly what happened and i was devastated 'cause i knew the
###128 atrocities that we're going to current iraq
###131 which we do have occurred
###133 in south howell salvador
###135 and of course it turns out he was right about that
###138 in case you're wondering you forgot also there was a long time ago
###141 how many people be killed in the war now some of the wrist most country in the
###145 latin america
###147 seventy five thousand s
###150 thanks a lot colonel steel really appreciated
###152 so of course dick cheney rumsfeld look at them go mission accomplished nicely
###156 done right wing death squads
###158 let's enum over iraq
###159 throughout the guardian piece you see rumsfeld lavish ng preys on steel
###163 all we've got the right guy in iraq
###166 this guidance steel he's doing the right things for us
###169 and of course
###171 cheney had worked with him in panama as well when he was part of the george h w
###175 bush administration
###176 uh... and by the way so now so there was thirty five thousand as having doubts
###180 that we have in iraq
###182 well according to those same documents that were leaked through with the leaks
###186 but is the government estimates so it is actually incredibly conservative ulo
###190 one hundred nine thousand and thirty two deaths in iraq between oh four oh nine
###195 including over sixty six
###198 fallows and
###199 civilians
###201 civilians
###203 we must be sold proud
###205 not even associated press has both of those numbers at higher livid over a
###209 hundred ten thousand that's
###211 course some other organizations in the past may be the best
###215 up to six hundred thousand i mean the scene one estimate over a million
###218 but everyone agrees at least a hundred and ten thousand deaths
###222 including a tremendous numbers for itself
###225 where these guys are these connected to java trails and higher correct
###229 pearl jam's cough and cold sore in stripes that he was quote
###233 the traces eyes and years
###235 out on the ground in iraq
###238 fantastic
###239 uh... now
###240 let me go to
###242 the video from
###243 uh... this series todd green tree
###245 who's gonna talk about colonel steals role
###248 it'll still rescue vehicle
###249 who understands how to conduct intelligence driven operations projects
###255 operational sells insurgency terrorist organization
###260 so he knows how to operate that
###262 is a good to be a successful because i a definition of success right
###265 but one thing is clear
###268 he's doing this
###269 at the behest of don so they came in job but resin fact
###273 gentle mont hubbard elsa mari
###275 who was uh... senior general iraq at the time said
###280 they worked hand-in-hand now that's a sure frantic hoffman
###283 and uh... temperate rain is
###285 i never saw them apart
###287 in the fifth forty or fifty times i saw them inside the detention centers
###292 they do everything that was going on there
###294 the torture
###296 hobo kinds of torture
###300 general
###300 ought not to be was ahead of the special commandos
###304 so that anybody knows what i have been it was ham he's a guy who ordered all of
###308 it
###308 he says quote
###310 until i left
###311 that america's new about everything i did
###314 they knew what was going on in the interrogation is
###317 and they knew the detainees
###321 so did we know what was happening you better
###324 no question about it
###326 jumble one guy that i also mari again quote
###329 they were secret never declared
###331 but the american top brass in iraqi leadership new all about these prisons
###337 the things that went on their controlling murder

###343 i've ever seen
###346 so they sought and they said the americans absolutely nobody researching
###350 deporting
###351 detention centers let alone the best was roaming the country
###355 so then we go to general montevideo somali one more time he says
###360 now beginning to describe the torture
###362 i remember a forty-year-old was tied to a libros columns
###366 and he was tied up with his legs above its head
###369 whose whole body was blue
###370 because of the impact of the cables
###372 with which he had been beat
###375 now there's more videos explaining some of the torture
###378 including by american journalist and western journalists there at the time
###383 they were too extreme detainees for information on the insurgency
###387 this year's to spin on the other side of things also that you know as you see
###392 this is not staying until the discomfort level
###396 first of all the things that went on that at least ratings and about
###400 courtroom provides the idea sort of sort of thing i have received but two dot he
###405 is
###407 so does present but i revert with the time was on assignment from the new york
###411 times

###429 but it wasn't they're kind of religious ecstasy or something like that these
###432 were the first things that uh... tenncare
###436 business to start shutting
###438 that at the clock willing for the streets
###440 these last two screens online
###442 house lost
###445 the manager and their seeming to enjoy um... the prisoner screams
###449 was a man who conducted those operations
###451 he's also the same one that i quoted earlier saying that america's new
###455 everything i did
###457 and those other two were reporters
###459 who couldn't believe
###460 that they would be interviewing steel
###462 and there would be a blot of pooled near the detainees is still would be
###467 would find any relevant would move on there was one
###470 pepper tubular time according to those two regulus present peter mah sin and
###474 some other generals that were there including the gentleman i
###477 quoted earlier more montana also mari saying i was well colonel steel
###482 they open the door
###483 and you see a guy hanging upside-down bloodied
###487 this note
###488 calmly closes the door and moves on
###491 he knows what's happening
###493 so what in fact that they did
###495 let's hear from one of the guys who was to work
###498 schindler everyone though
###500 will be blindfolded and handcuffed behind our banks and then they would be
###504 to shovel sometimes would be tied to a space wall will be home from the ceiling

###514 literally stores long litany
###516 electrocuted me let me from the ceiling they're pulling up my is with players
###521 stamping ahead asking about my wife saying they would bring her head
###526 i remember adams how they came into the library but he told captains arriving
###531 captain allen resume the prisoners turned dislocated shoulders like this is
###535 because people were having to undergo surgery when they were released in the
###539 library
###541 at one point they actually ran a reality show in iraq in is unbelievable
###545 with a we show the tortured detainees
###548 kind of rubbing it in people's faces is what we do so you better watch out
###551 now that was the height of the sectarian conflict with thousands are dying every
###555 single mom
###556 was a really like it was a turn people
###558 finally jumper trance have a call in and say hey listen at least though show the
###562 tortured people on t_v_
###564 is he not merciful
###566 now if you don't believe
###567 iraqi generals are you going to believe the reporters a you don't believe the
###570 people who were torture
###572 well the guardian also found
###574 some u_s_ soldiers and troops
###576 that were there
###577 recourse on them thus a man from the sixty nine armand rasmus soldier
###581 who's appointed some are in two thousand five he says
###584 it was like the nazis
###586 the gestapo basically
###588 they the commandos
###589 would essentially torture anybody that they had good reason to suspect
###593 knew something was part of this urgency were supporting it
###596 and people knew about that
###598 in saying that
###600 the troops knew all about the americans knew about it
###602 the commanders knew all about about it
###604 one of these brave u_s_ troops execute on the record is names neal smith
###608 there's a twenty-year-old mc medications some are
###611 he's now born again christian and trying to make amends for what he thinks he did
###616 in rak nieces qu
###618 what was pretty widely known in our battalion deftly inopportune
###622 was that they were pretty violin with their interrogation is
###624 they would be people shocked electric shock
###627 stabbed them i don't know what else
###629 sounds like pretty awful things
###632 one last soldier
###634 who was actually handing over people to be torture
###637 these detainees said quote
###639 if somebody gets arrested
###641 and we hand them over to mold
###643 they're going to get their balls hooked electrocuted
###646 where they're going to get beaten or raped up an ass with a coke bottle
###650 or something like that
###656 what we
###658 the right wing that's wise to do in el salvador
###661 that led to a broadcast civil war there
###664 with seventy five thousand dead
###665 we get a d_n_a_ in iraq
###668 and what we have
###669 the same exact results
###671 desk once courtroom
###673 elimination of political opponents
###675 and what happened
###676 a hundred and ten thousand dead
###678 at least
###680 we for the love of god stop sending colonel steeled into these situations
###688 this is what we found out about our government
###690 this is what our democracy was up to
###693 if we can all about being decent human beings
###696 the light on for the world as we claim we are
###699 we should never do this again
###701 colonel still is not an american hero
###704 he does not productive
###706 he is the exact opposite result so would be seen him in beings would want
###711 these are not some sort of
###712 glorious heroes as they were
###715 review you know
###716 made out to be by the right wing during the contra scandal by the ricardo still
###720 involved in the contra scandal of course
###724 and they do these hideous things again and again
###727 and we have to stop them
###729 the fact that god we found out
###731 where they did this time around so that we might be for people to prevented the
###734 next time around
###735 and how do we find out bradley many
###738 that is of course twice
###740 possibly facing a life sentence
###742 how about the guys who
###744 did the torture
###745 who ran the desk wives
###747 who taught people how to do the torture in the best clubs
###750 they of course
###752 are free to go
