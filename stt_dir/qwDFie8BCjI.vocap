###11 DAVID CHOE: In the end, only kindness matters.
###14 That's what Jewel says.
###16 And this is where she's going to be playing, at the
###19 Horseshoe Casino Hotel in beautiful Tunica, Mississippi.
###24 And not to be a cocktease--
###26 I have absolutely no desire to see Jewel.
###28 I'm here to gamble with some money.
###30 Got a cash advance on my credit card.
###33 I need to buy a boat.
###35 I want to go down the Mississippi River.
###36 
###40 Thumbs up, America.
###41 
###47 Hate to do the obnoxious money shot, but, 20 minutes later,
###51 nice hand at the blackjack tables with
###53 Jeff, the dealer, and--
###55 looks like I got some boat money.
###58 Hate to be a fucking prick, but you know how it goes.
###63 Ready for a nice boat ride, Harry?
###66 HARRY (OFFSCREEN): Let's do it.
###66 To win some, you lose some.
###67 DAVID CHOE: Tunica, Mississippi.
###68 M-I-S-S-I-S-S-I-P-P-I.
###70 HARRY: It's time you won.
###71 Let's do it.
###73 
###82 DAVID CHOE: Benny, who's wearing a shirt that says
###85 Benny Thompson, but it's actually not him, just came
###88 out here to warn us that a lady complained about--
###91 BENNY: And she thought y'all were some
###93 terrorists or something.
###94 DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN): She thought we were terrorists
###95 because we're backpacked and we're foreigners.
###96 BENNY: Yeah.
###97 DAVID CHOE: All right.
###97 What are they saying exactly?
###99 There's foreigners out there that look like terrorists?
###102 BENNY: Yeah, but you don't though.
###104 DAVID CHOE: Bin Laden's cousin.
###106 BENNY: [INAUDIBLE].
###109 Where y'all hiking to?
###111 HARRY: Well we want to go to Greenville tonight.
###113 DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN): Well, the only reason why we might
###113 want to go to Greenville is there's a Walmart there, and
###115 there's an inflatable raft at the Walmart
###117 that's waiting for us.
###118 I want a boat.
###119 I want to take a boat down the Mississippi River.
###121 A little boat.
###122 Not a big boat.
###123 BENNY: In the Mississippi River?
###124 DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN): Yeah, in the Mississippi River.
###125 BENNY: What are y'all smoking on, man?
###127 You're talking about-- you're going to get crushed in that
###128 river, man.
###128 DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN): From what?
###129 It's of water, man.
###130 BENNY: Man, that's the most dangerous river in the world.
###132 DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN): Why?
###132 Why is it dangerous?
###133 BENNY: There's holes, sinkholes, and all kind of
###135 stuff like that.
###136 DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN): What's a sinkhole?
###136 BENNY: It's a sinkhole when a barge comes up down the river,
###140 and it wipes you on the side of it, man.
###141 DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN): Oh, wow.
###143 And have you gone swimming in the Mississippi River?
###145 BENNY: No.
###145 Anybody's gonna be swimming [INAUDIBLE]:?
###146 DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN): Have you known anyone that's swam
###148 in the river?
###148 BENNY: No.
###149 I know a couple guys--
###150 DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN): So you're from Mississippi and
###151 you don't know anyone who's ever swam in
###152 the Mississippi River?
###152 BENNY: No.
###153 DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN): All right, I'll find a boat.
###154 BENNY: OK, I'll tell--
###155 DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN): I'm going to sail down the
###156 Mississippi River.
###158 I'm going to ditch the sinkholes.
###159 I'm going to ditch the undercurrent.
###160 I'm going to ditch the sewage.
###161 BENNY: All right.
###162 I only heard of Huckleberry Finn.
###163 
###166 DAVID CHOE: I'll be your Huckleberry Finn.
###168 How about a ride?
###169 How bout a lift?
###170 Come on.
###171 BENNY: I ain't got time.
###171 I got work to do.
###172 DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN): Where's your truck, Benny?
###173 BENNY: My truck's right there.
###174 DAVID CHOE: Give me a fucking ride.
###175 BENNY: My truck's right there.
###176 DAVID CHOE: Let's go talk about it in the truck.
###177 Benny's totally fucking with us right now.
###179 Pointed at his truck and said it was a white guy truck, then
###181 told us it's really his truck.
###183 BENNY: It's my truck.
###183 DAVID CHOE: It's obvious Benny has a high sex drive.
###186 He has his own custom Ford sticker with a
###189 naked woman on it.
###191 Benny.
###192 BENNY: He's cool, man.
###193 Hooks me up with everything, man.
###194 Clothes.
###195 Shoes.
###196 
###209 DAVID CHOE: Let's go, let's go.
###210 
###213 Bye, Benny.
###214 
###219 Thank you, sir.
###220 
###223 Yeah, let's go, let's go.
###225 Yeah, let's do it.
###226 Oh, my god.
###228 You are crazy, sir.
###229 This is the best ride ever.
###232 We're in Tunica, Mississippi.
###234 Just jumped in a fucking limo.
###236 HARRY: Limo!
###236 DAVID CHOE: And we're going to Walmart.
###238 
###242 Wow.
###243 And the lights are changing.
###245 What's your name, sir?
###247 LENNY HILL: Lenny Hill.
###248 DAVID CHOE: Lenny Hill?
###249 Thank you so much for the ride.
###251 This is the best ride ever.
###252 We thought we were going to get a ride with Benny, and
###255 next thing you know, we get a ride with Lenny Hill, in the
###258 fucking limo, heading over to Walmart, Tunica, Mississippi.
###260 HARRY: Wow.
###261 Thumbs up, America.
###263 Dreams do come true.
###264 
###272 DAVID CHOE: Lenny, thank you so much, sir.
###275 LENNY HILL: All right, hope you enjoyed yourselves.
###275 DAVID CHOE: Yes.
###276 I enjoyed it, too.
###277 Are you from out here?
###278 LENNY HILL: Yeah.
###279 DAVID CHOE: Lenny, we were standing out there for no less
###282 than 10 minutes in front of a gas station when Benny, the
###286 guy you saw us talking to, his employer came out and told us,
###289 two women came in and complained that they saw
###291 foreigners wearing backpacks, and that we were terrorists,
###295 and that they were going to call the police on us.
###296 LENNY HILL: Oh, my lord.
###297 DAVID CHOE: And then you came in and you saved the day.
###298 You got us out of town.
###299 LENNY HILL: Well, you don't look like terrorists to me.
###302 DAVID CHOE: And at any point during this ride, were you
###305 scared of your life?
###307 At any point in this ride, did you have any weird sexual
###309 feelings towards me or Harry?
###311 LENNY HILL: No.
###311 DAVID CHOE: Nothing?
###311 OK.
###312 You're really champion.
###314 This was one of the best rides ever.
###315 Thank you so much.
###316 If there was women in the back, it would've been a
###318 little bit better.
###318 LENNY HILL: Sorry about the women.
###319 DAVID CHOE: I'm not complaining at all.
###321 Thank you so much, man.
###321 LENNY HILL: Bye bye.
###323 DAVID CHOE: This is fucking amazing.
###324 There's a golf course right there.
###326 
###336 So here we are at hole seven or hole number eight,
###340 somewhere in Mississippi golf courses, some of the best
###343 places to have sex, some of the best places to light
###345 fireworks, some of the best places to just get some
###347 shut-eye after the whole shut-down.
###349 You know, country living, living in style.
###352 Cornfield right next to the golf course.
###355 We're right next to the golf course.
###356 We'll catch some shut-eye here and then, we'll be off on the
###360 road tomorrow.
###361 Good night, America.
###363 HARRY: Peace.
###364 
###374 DAVID CHOE: Day 12.
###377 We got our limo driver yesterday to stop at five
###380 different Walmarts so that we could find an inflatable raft
###383 to take down the Mississippi River.
###387 And basically, everyone that we talked to, everyone that we
###390 met is born and raised in Mississippi.
###393 They know of people that have actually swam in the
###395 Mississippi River but they all died.
###397 And no Sport Mart, no sporting goods store, no Walmart
###402 actually sells an inflatable raft because it's a fucking
###407 stupid idea.
###408 There's sinkholes, there's a strong undercurrent, and
###411 nobody really takes a raft down the river.
###413 And so the closest we could find is the Monster Deck Tube.
###417 And I imagine our adventure down the Mississippi River
###420 will resemble this a little bit.
###423 That's me.
###424 That's Harry.
###425 So, I just want to give an early "fuck you" to everyone
###428 who said, "Don't do it.
###429 You're a fucking idiot." I'm about to go down the
###432 Mississippi River.
###432 I'm going to have an awesome time.
###434 And I'm gonna get a killer tan.
###436 
###447 DAVID CHOE: We're trying to get down to Louisiana.
###451 The current seems sort of weak, but you know, that might
###457 be misleading.
###458 
###478 DAVID CHOE: Here we are, going down the Mississippi River.
###481 Me and my buddy, Harry.
###483 Our camera man, Jacinto--
###485 great guy --had absolutely no faith in going down
###488 the river with us.
###489 So it's just me and Harry and our little shitty camera.
###492 HARRY (OFFSCREEN): Yup.
###493 
###496 DAVID CHOE: All right.
###499 My feet are starting to itch a little bit.
###501 We're going by some factory industrial-looking thing, and
###504 there's some brownish-looking water pouring into the river.
###507 All right, America, I gotta start paddling, so fuck off.
###509 
###513 You see that shit, dude?
###514 We're at least going like five miles an hour now.
###517 It's the umbrella sail.
###520 HARRY: Wow.
###522 We don't have to row anymore.
###524 DAVID CHOE: This is awesome.
###527 Dude, we're fucking moving, man.
###529 
###536 My credit card company called yesterday and said I'm late on
###539 all my payments, on all my cash advances.
###542 It's amazing how the tide turns.
###544 One day you have no money.
###545 Next day you win a couple grand in Tunica, Mississippi.
###549 Next day, you're on a boat.
###551 The credit card company can eat my ass right now.
###553 There's really no where else I'd rather be right now.
###556 I'm fucking sailing down the Mississippi River.
###558 I wish--
###560 the only other thing that I would like is if I was-- whoa!
###565 HARRY (OFFSCREEN): If you're on board.
###566 DAVID CHOE: Is if I was lying on my back like this, and my
###569 girlfriend was sitting on my face.
###570 And I'm holding the umbrella sail like this.
###573 HARRY: That would be amazing.
###575 DAVID CHOE: But, really there's no where else I'd
###576 rather be right now.
###577 
###587 HARRY: Bon voyage.
###589 I'm going to brave the sinkholes.
###590 
###595 DAVID CHOE: Can you touch the bottom?
###597 HARRY: No.
###597 DAVID CHOE: Can you see any catfish?
###599 HARRY: I don't feel any.
###601 DAVID CHOE: Can you see any?
###603 HARRY: Can't see shit, it's all brown.
###605 DAVID CHOE: Are there any black mermaids down there?
###608 HARRY: I think.
###610 
###660 DAVID CHOE: We changed our mind.
###663 We're having too much of a good time.
###664 Fuck camping out.
###666 Let's fucking keep this adventure going.
###668 We're going to stay on the river all night.
###669 See how far we get.
###670 We went 20 miles today.
###671 Probably get 30, 40, maybe even 50 miles by tomorrow.
###675 Only thing is, we're stuck in like some kind of weird
###678 current in the middle of the river.
###679 
###685 HARRY (OFFSCREEN): Guess they don't want to stop for us.
###688 DAVID CHOE: Let's give them a honker.
###689 HARRY (OFFSCREEN): Yeah, let them know what's up.
###691 [HONK]
###695 DAVID CHOE: Yeah, we're OK.
###697 How far are you guys headed?
###698 
###700 How far are you guys headed?
###701 SPEAKER 1: We're getting ready to go fishing.
###703 DAVID CHOE: Can you give us a lift?
###705 SPEAKER 1: Yeah, man.
###705 DAVID CHOE: All right.
###707 
###710 All right.
###710 SPEAKER 1: OK.
###712 DAVID CHOE: What's your name?
###713 SPEAKER 1: [INAUDIBLE].
###714 DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN): Dave and Harry.
###715 SPEAKER 1: Dave and who?
###716 DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN): Harry.
###717 SPEAKER 1: Harry?
###718 HARRY (OFFSCREEN): Yeah.
###718 SPEAKER 1: Nice to meet y'all.
###720 DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN): Nice to meet you guys, too.
###720 What do you guys do during the week?
###722 SPEAKER 1: Work.
###723 DAVID CHOE: Yeah?
###724 Where?
###724 SPEAKER 1: I drive a truck.
###726 [INAUDIBLE].
###726 DAVID CHOE: You ever pick up hitch-hikers?
###728 SPEAKER 1: You know, I haven't seen no hitch-hikers no more.
###731 DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN): That's true.
###732 Why do you think that is?
###733 SPEAKER 1: You see?
###734 On the interstate border?
###735 DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN): Right.
###736 SPEAKER 1: A guy picked up girls up there.
###739 He was killed.
###740 DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN): Oh, OK.
###741 SPEAKER 1: Fucking heard it on the news.
###742 DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN): That was you?
###743 SPEAKER 1: Hell no.
###745 They killed him.
###747 He was killed and thrown in the Arkansas River.
###750 HARRY (OFFSCREEN): Damn.
###753 DAVID CHOE: It really, really doesn't get better than this.
###756 
###759 Who says you can't get picked up by truckers?
###763 These are our friends from Arkansas.
###764 They just gave us--
###765 truckers that gave us our first lift on a boat, and
###768 hooked us up with some beer.
###770 Thank you, gentlemen.
###771 Have a good time fishing.
###772 Have a good weekend.
###774 Take care.
###775 Awesome ride, thank you guys.
###776 SPEAKER 1: Thank you.
###779 DAVID CHOE: Wow.
###780 It really doesn't get better than that.
###782 All right, I'm fucking in my boxers, lying on a raft,
###787 drinking beers and booze with my friend Harry, and they're
###789 fucking cold.
###790 HARRY: Yeah.
###790 DAVID CHOE: Harry, can I ask you a question?
###792 HARRY: What?
###792 DAVID CHOE: Why is life so rad?
###794 HARRY: It is.
###795 It just is.
###796 And we're down in the river.
###797 DAVID CHOE: They brought us at least 8 miles down the river.
###800 New Orleans is at least 400 miles still away, so that'll
###803 probably take us two weeks to get to, but as long as we get
###805 about 8 more miles to a town called Eudora, Arkansas.
###809 We can get to service road from there and hitch on down
###813 to New Orleans.
###814 
###822 I don't know how the light looks to you guys, but the
###825 sun's going down, and it's gonna be pitch-black in about
###828 30 minutes.
###829 And it is gonna be super dangerous out here.
###832 
###845 Pitch black.
###846 2:00 in the morning, floating down the Mississippi River.
###850 I mean this is shit that film or video will
###852 never be able to capture.
###854 One of these big barges come by, and every time they go by,
###856 it makes little wakes that makes your boat feel like it's
###859 going to flip over.
###861 I mean, it's unbelievable.
###866 It's just me and Harry drifting down this river at
###868 two miles an hour.
###870 All you hear is grasshoppers, and locusts, and
###872 cicadas, and dogs and--
###875 see every fucking star.
###878 It's beautiful.
###879 
###884 We just docked our boat right there.
###887 It's about 2:00 in the morning.
###890 We got scared when our boat started poking into the sticks
###894 coming out of the ground, so we're going to camp out here
###896 for the night.
###898 It's good a place as any.
###899 
###902 We got two bonfires going.
###903 We got this old tree that fell down, and we're lighting the
###907 entire stump on fire.
###908 The smell of burning embers in the air.
###911 We got the little baby one started.
###913 I cut off my shirt.
###914 I'm starting to look like the Incredible Hulk.
###916 As day 13 arrives, Sunday, I really had my heart on going
###920 to church tomorrow, but this might be better than church at
###926 getting in touch with God.
###927 
###930 I hope with my fried brain, I'm able to remember nights
###934 like this because this is one of the best nights of my life.
###936 
###943 Rise and shine, America.
###945 We're at day 13 at Thumbs Up, America.
###949 
###951 The light's starting to come up.
###953 I'm guessing it's 4:00, 5:00 in the morning.
###958 The sun has not yet risen over the Mississippi.
###961 I have swamp butt, mud butt.
###966 My face is swollen from the morning frost.
###971 Spider bites, horse flies, mosquitoes.
###973 
###976 I can't even feel my face.
###977 It feels worse than when we slept at the golf course.
###982 It got a lot colder than we thought.
###984 But, I'll tell you what, I couldn't be happier.
###987 Anyway, the sun's coming up.
###990 We want to head a little deeper into Louisiana before
###993 we hit the streets.
###995 So, wish us luck, America.
###996 
###1022 I think if my calculations are correct, we're either at the
###1027 very tip of Arkansas, or at least at the tip of Louisiana.
###1030 That'd be awesome if we made it all the way to Louisiana.
###1033 
###1038 Looks like we made it.
###1039 Lake Providence, Louisiana.
###1041 Of all the places we could end up, we end up in the Private
###1045 Resort Hunting Club.
###1046 They shoot on sight.
###1049 HARRY: No trespassers.
###1050 DAVID CHOE: We got here in the daytime instead of night.
###1056 So we're lucky.
###1057 
###1069 DAVID CHOE: And they all have guns.
###1070 
###1083 DAVID CHOE: We're in Louisiana in the south.
###1086 Catching a ride from a private hunting club to the main road.
###1090 Just got off the river.
###1092 I see cotton fields and I see a noose hanging by a tree.
###1095 
###1100 What do you think about that?
###1101 
###1113 DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN): I know I've been
###1115 constipated for a few days.
###1116 If I saw that, I would've went [POOP NOISE].
###1118 That is--
###1119 I'm scared just sitting here right now.
###1120 
###1128 DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN): I'm laughing
###1129 but I'm crying inside.
###1130 
###1134 DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN): Oh, my god.
###1136 SPEAKER 2: Well, how is hitch-hiking
###1138 these days and times?
###1140 DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN): Well, have you
###1140 ever hitch-hiked before?
###1141 SPEAKER 2: I used to.
###1141 I've hitch-hiked very little, but I used to pick up
###1144 hitch-hikers back in the early '80s, but I don't
###1147 pick them up any more.
###1147 DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN): And your reason for that is?
###1149 SPEAKER 2: Frickin' nuts out there.
###1151 DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN): But what happened in the '80s and
###1153 '90s until now that--
###1155 the world has just transformed into a bunch
###1157 of nut jobs or something?
###1158 SPEAKER 2: Yeah, some of them.
###1161 DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN): I mean, I don't think the
###1163 quotient of nut jobs have changed.
###1164 I think the media has changed, you know?
###1166 SPEAKER 2: I don't know.
###1167 As you get older and you get a family, you get more scared
###1170 about people.
###1170 DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN): That's true.
###1172 SPEAKER 2: Y'all will have something to talk about when
###1173 you get older.
###1174 [INAUDIBLE]
###1175 I think it's pretty cool.
###1176 
###1185 
###1188 DAVID CHOE (OFFSCREEN): Yeah.
###1189 I appreciate the ride.
###1190 
###1196 DAVID CHOE: We gotta get a recap.
###1200 Get into it.
###1201 Get off the river.
###1203 That last family in town, they didn't leave for hunting for
###1207 the day for whatever reason.
###1209 Get lucky, they gave us 15 miles into town.
###1212 I mean, ha-ha-ha, funny, it's like what the fuck, dude.
###1216 Two Chinamen just rolled in on a raft into your backyard.
###1219 And we gave them the raft.
###1221 About to get two cheeseburgers.
###1224 Tired as fuck.
###1225 Dehydrated as fuck.
###1227 I'm gonna faint.
###1227 I'm gonna eat like six of these fruit smoothie, cream
###1230 slush, shakes and malts.
###1231 
###1235 We're in Louisiana, so gonna hit New Orleans.
###1239 Should be there by tonight.
###1240 We're gonna hitch out of town right now.
###1241
