CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: First up today on CNN
STUDENT NEWS, this Florida resident was in


2
0:0:17,66 --> 0:0:22,5
his bedroom last Thursday night, suddenly,
the ground underneath opened up and swallowed


3
0:0:22,5 --> 0:0:28,3
him. A sinkhole about 20 feet wide and 50
to 60 feet deep formed underneath Jeff Bush`s


4
0:0:28,3 --> 0:0:28,84
room.


5
0:0:28,84 --> 0:0:31,41
His brother Jeremy talked about what happened
when it started.


6
0:0:31,41 --> 0:0:32,129
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


7
0:0:32,129 --> 0:0:36,0
JEREMY BUSH, VICTIM`S BROTHER: I heard a loud
crash like a car coming through the house.


8
0:0:36,0 --> 0:0:44,609
And I remember my mother screaming, so I ran
back there, and tried going inside his room,


9
0:0:44,609 --> 0:0:49,12
but when I turned the light on, all I see
was this big hole, real big hole.


10
0:0:49,12 --> 0:0:49,76
(END VIDEO CLIP)


11
0:0:49,76 --> 0:0:53,32
AZUZ: Jeremy Bush jumped into that hole to
try to save his brother, but he couldn`t find


12
0:0:53,32 --> 0:0:58,79
him. And officials called off their search
on Saturday, partly because of the same reason


13
0:0:58,79 --> 0:1:3,18
why workers began demolishing the house. The
sinkhole was expanding, and there were concerns


14
0:1:3,18 --> 0:1:7,77
that house might collapse at any time. Sometimes
sinkholes are smaller, they might cause the


15
0:1:7,77 --> 0:1:13,28
ground to sag or cause or cause a small panda
form. Other times, they can be huge, like


16
0:1:13,28 --> 0:1:15,92
this one you`re looking at it right now from
Guatemala.


17
0:1:15,92 --> 0:1:20,6
Or the great blue hole, an underwater sinkhole
off the coast of Belize. Florida actually


18
0:1:20,6 --> 0:1:24,27
gets a lot of sinkholes, and that`s because
the ground across a lot of the state is made


19
0:1:24,27 --> 0:1:29,289
up of limestone, a sedimentary rock. Nick
Valencia explains how that can lead to this


20
0:1:29,289 --> 0:1:29,569
sinkholes.


21
0:1:29,569 --> 0:1:30,119
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


22
0:1:30,119 --> 0:1:34,999
NICK VALENCIA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: How do sinkholes
form? Let`s break this down for you here.


23
0:1:34,999 --> 0:1:39,729
Sinkholes are usually a naturally occurring
event. Now, what happens is, rain water, that


24
0:1:39,729 --> 0:1:44,569
heavy rain water sorts of sits on top of that
bedrock sanding clay. If you take into account


25
0:1:44,569 --> 0:1:49,749
Florida`s landscape, but it gets a lot of
that very porous limestone. It allows the


26
0:1:49,749 --> 0:1:55,89
rain, this acidic rain to sort of percolate
down into this oil forming this cave like


27
0:1:55,89 --> 0:1:57,539
-- cave like sinkholes here.


28
0:1:57,539 --> 0:2:2,259
And also, sometimes, it`s drought that causes
these caves-like formations. And that`s further


29
0:2:2,259 --> 0:2:6,899
punctuated by that heavy rain that sort of
sits on top of there, causing this to open


30
0:2:6,899 --> 0:2:12,73
up and perhaps, some of the scariest scenarios
in Florida, is that you cannot predict sinkholes.


31
0:2:12,73 --> 0:2:16,72
It`s highly expensive to predict them yet.
To use very expensive equipment and it`s really


32
0:2:16,72 --> 0:2:21,68
tough to pinpoint where these sinkholes are.
In fact, it`s so common about the currents


33
0:2:21,68 --> 0:2:22,65
in Florida.


34
0:2:22,65 --> 0:2:27,89
All of these little blue dots freckled up
and down the state of Florida are past instances


35
0:2:27,89 --> 0:2:31,87
of sinkholes. Now, here, where it happened
on Thursday night in early Friday morning


36
0:2:31,87 --> 0:2:36,48
in Hillsboro County at the Bush residence,
this is the place that the Florida Department


37
0:2:36,48 --> 0:2:42,379
of State says is susceptible to abruptly forming
collapse sinkholes. It`s an area that`s dominated


38
0:2:42,379 --> 0:2:46,17
by them, an area that`s had problems with
sinkholes in the past.

41
0:2:49,6 --> 0:2:54,349
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Just the facts -- Affirmative
Action aims to improve opportunities for women


42
0:2:54,349 --> 0:2:59,159
and members of minority groups. It started
as a way to help people who had been discriminate


43
0:2:59,159 --> 0:3:4,219
against in the past. Critics argue that it
uses reverse discrimination to accomplish


44
0:3:4,219 --> 0:3:10,31
its goals. Affirmative action policies have
been used in employment and education.


45
0:3:10,31 --> 0:3:13,81
(END VIDEO CLIP)


46
0:3:13,81 --> 0:3:18,93
AZUZ: Abigail Fisher says Affirmative Action
is the reason why she didn`t get in the University


47
0:3:18,93 --> 0:3:23,42
of Texas. She sued the school over its admissions
policies, and the case went all the way to


48
0:3:23,42 --> 0:3:27,84
the U.S. Supreme Court. The decision on it
could come out today. Joe Johns breaks down


49
0:3:27,84 --> 0:3:31,92
the details of the case and some of the arguments
on both sides.


50
0:3:31,92 --> 0:3:37,549
Abigail Fisher dreamed of going to the University
of Texas at Austin for most of her life. After


51
0:3:37,549 --> 0:3:43,69
applying, she didn`t get in, attending Louisiana
State University instead. But the rejection


52
0:3:43,69 --> 0:3:48,129
from U.T. led Fisher to file a lawsuit against
the school claiming she was squeezed out,


53
0:3:48,129 --> 0:3:53,469
unfairly denied admission because of her race.
She is white. She said in a statement, "There


54
0:3:53,469 --> 0:3:57,459
were people in my class with lower grades
who weren`t in all the activities I was in


55
0:3:57,459 --> 0:4:2,139
who were being accepted into U.T., and the
only other difference between us was the color


56
0:4:2,139 --> 0:4:3,37
of our skin."


57
0:4:3,37 --> 0:4:7,62
Whether race should be part of the application
process at the University of Texas is the


58
0:4:7,62 --> 0:4:12,629
issue before the Supreme Court. Edward Bloom
recruited Abigail Fisher to file the lawsuit.


59
0:4:12,629 --> 0:4:16,28
EDWARD BLURN, PROJECT ON FAIR REPRESENTATION:
The most important question is, should a university


60
0:4:16,28 --> 0:4:22,17
judge a student by his or her skin color when
it comes time for admission. And the answer


61
0:4:22,17 --> 0:4:22,91
is no.


62
0:4:22,91 --> 0:4:27,37
Here`s how the admissions process at U.T.
works: the top ten percent of each high school


63
0:4:27,37 --> 0:4:32,33
class statewide gets in automatically. For
those below the top ten percent, like Abigail


64
0:4:32,33 --> 0:4:38,8
Fisher, who was in the 11th percent, the university
uses what it calls, a holistic review where


65
0:4:38,8 --> 0:4:43,69
race is one of many factors considered. One
that University President Bill Powers says,


66
0:4:43,69 --> 0:4:46,19
doesn`t get much weight, and didn`t play role
in Fisher`s rejection.


67
0:4:46,19 --> 0:4:50,12
BILL POWERS, PRESIDENT, UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS
AT AUSTIN: We take ethnicity as one of many,


68
0:4:50,12 --> 0:4:55,84
many factors in our holistic review to make
sure that the three quarters coming in under


69
0:4:55,84 --> 0:5:1,84
automatic admission, that we add to that with
a quarter coming in where we can work for


70
0:5:1,84 --> 0:5:4,5
these other characteristics including diversity.


71
0:5:4,5 --> 0:5:7,25
BRADLEY POOLE, PRESIDENT, UT BLACK STUDENT
ALLIANCE: I think she`s fighting the wrong


72
0:5:7,25 --> 0:5:7,78
fight.


73
0:5:7,78 --> 0:5:12,199
POWERS: Minority student leaders on campus
like Bradley Poole, agree with Powers that


74
0:5:12,199 --> 0:5:14,96
the process is fair, despite Fisher`s claims.


75
0:5:14,96 --> 0:5:19,419
POOLE: Seeing as race is probably one of least
the parts of the holistic review process.


76
0:5:19,419 --> 0:5:24,9
I feel like it`s harping on the wrong -- on
one of the things that -- on the easiest thing


77
0:5:24,9 --> 0:5:26,389
that she could have -- she could have win
against.


78
0:5:26,389 --> 0:5:31,18
POWERS: Others take offense that the lawsuit
implies some minority students are less deserving


79
0:5:31,18 --> 0:5:32,78
of admission than the white counterparts.


80
0:5:32,78 --> 0:5:36,919
CATHERINE RODARTE, STUDENT UNIVERSITY OF TEXAST
AT AUSTIN: To hear people saying that some


81
0:5:36,919 --> 0:5:41,3
of us, Latinos, got in here easily, and the
only reason we got in here is because of the


82
0:5:41,3 --> 0:5:45,949
race. That`s really disappointing. We worked
just as hard as anyone else to get here to


83
0:5:45,949 --> 0:5:46,22
U.T.


84
0:5:46,22 --> 0:5:50,77
POWERS: But conservative groups siding with
Fisher argue it`s not just about getting in.


85
0:5:50,77 --> 0:5:55,3
The U.S. civil rights commission says studies
show that using racial preferences can hurt


86
0:5:55,3 --> 0:5:59,2
minorities by starting them out near the bottom
of their classes.

Nairobi is the capital of what African country?


91
0:6:10,389 --> 0:6:20,979
You know what to do. Is it Kenya, Tanzania,
Uganda or Zambia? You`ve got three seconds,


92
0:6:20,979 --> 0:6:22,3
go!


93
0:6:22,3 --> 0:6:27,21
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Nairobi is a capital
of Kenya. It`s also the country`s largest


94
0:6:27,21 --> 0:6:31,55
city. That`s your answer and that`s your "Shoutout."


95
0:6:31,55 --> 0:6:33,8
(END VIDEO CLIP)


96
0:6:33,8 --> 0:6:39,25
AZUZ: Nairobi is a unique place. There is
a national park, about four miles from downtown


97
0:6:39,25 --> 0:6:46,199
where zebras, rhinos and giraffes run free.
The park also had predators. 13-year old Richard


98
0:6:46,199 --> 0:6:50,629
Terrere (ph) lives in a farm near the park.
He says that at night lions from the park


99
0:6:50,629 --> 0:6:55,5
used to eat his family`s cattle. When he noticed
when people walked around with flashlights,


100
0:6:55,5 --> 0:7:1,36
the lions stayed away. That gave Richard an
idea: first, he set up a solar panel that


101
0:7:1,36 --> 0:7:6,22
charged a battery during the day. That powered
what you`re about to see, these lights right


102
0:7:6,22 --> 0:7:10,819
here at night. Richard made the lights flash,
so it looked like someone was walking around


103
0:7:10,819 --> 0:7:14,37
with the flashlight, and that`s been keeping
the big cats away.


104
0:7:14,37 --> 0:7:20,319
Next up today, the NFL combine gives players
a chance to show off their skills to pro-teams.


105
0:7:20,319 --> 0:7:25,889
Lauren Silberman was at original combine yesterday
making history as the first woman to try out


106
0:7:25,889 --> 0:7:30,669
for the NFL as a place kicker. Our Women`s
History Months coverage rolls on with some


107
0:7:30,669 --> 0:7:36,28
other sporting famous firsts. Back in 1977,
Janet Guthrie was the first woman to drive


108
0:7:36,28 --> 0:7:41,52
in the Indianapolis 500. Julie Krone displayed
a different kind of horse power becoming the


109
0:7:41,52 --> 0:7:46,8
first female jockey to win a Triple Crown
race. Babe Didrikson Zaharias broke golf`s


110
0:7:46,8 --> 0:7:52,189
gender barrier in 1938. She was also an Olympic
gold medalist in track and field.


111
0:7:52,189 --> 0:7:57,31
Ila Borders makes the list twice. The first
female pitcher to win in men`s baseball game


112
0:7:57,31 --> 0:8:2,939
and the first woman to earn a college baseball
scholarship. In 2002, Lisa Leslie threw down


113
0:8:2,939 --> 0:8:8,909
the first slam dunk in the woman`s pro game.
Ten years earlier, Manon Rheaume manned the


114
0:8:8,909 --> 0:8:13,789
net for a post-season hockey game with the
Tampa Bay lightning. And in the tennis match,


115
0:8:13,789 --> 0:8:17,96
that was known as the battle of the sexes
-- Billie Jean King beat Bobbie Riggs head


116
0:8:17,96 --> 0:8:24,5
to head in 1973. Whether it`s as individual
or part of a team, what do you think about


117

women competing in traditionally male-dominated
sports? Sound off in our blog at cnnstudentnews.com.

120
0:8:38,5 --> 0:8:42,719
You might have known that the Iditarod is
called the last great race on earth. You probably


121
0:8:42,719 --> 0:8:47,63
didn`t know that most competitors cover about
110 miles a day. It`s not much if you are


122
0:8:47,63 --> 0:8:51,66
driving, but if you are driving a team of
sled dogs across the Alaskan wilderness in


123
0:8:51,66 --> 0:8:56,65
frigid temperatures, it`s much more intimidating.
It starts in Anchorage and ends in the remote


124
0:8:56,65 --> 0:9:2,41
town of Nome, Alaska. Recalling a time around
the year 1900 when dogs sleds were used to


125
0:9:2,41 --> 0:9:8,12
get supplies and mail there. Planes have been
doing it since the 1920s, except in 1925,


126
0:9:8,12 --> 0:9:13,81
when there was an outbreak of the disease
diphtheria, and pilots couldn`t get through.


127
0:9:13,81 --> 0:9:18,71
Then in temperatures far below zero, sled
dogs were called on once again to get medication


128
0:9:18,71 --> 0:9:23,88
where it was needed. The story became so famous
that a statue of a lead dog Balto was put


129
0:9:23,88 --> 0:9:28,78
up in New York. It`s still there today. The
modern Iditarod route changes from year to


130
0:9:28,78 --> 0:9:34,29
year. It crosses miles of ice and two mountain
ranges. And it required teams to rest, provides


131
0:9:34,29 --> 0:9:39,35
dog food at race checkpoints, and has veterinarians
and advisers to ensure that mushers and their


132
0:9:39,35 --> 0:9:44,8
dogs are kept safe along a trail that used
to be anything but.


133
0:9:44,8 --> 0:9:48,75
It`s always good to know the races and dogs
are watched over when they embark. It helps


134
0:9:48,75 --> 0:9:53,39
keep the whole race from going downhill. And
we tried to come up with a pun on Iditarod,


135
0:9:53,39 --> 0:11:53,39
but it just didn`t amount to mush. CNN STUDENT
NEWS sets off again tomorrow. See you then.
