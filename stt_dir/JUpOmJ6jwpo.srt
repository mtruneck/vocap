CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: Some significant events
happened on December 10th. 143 years ago Wyoming


2
0:0:5,7 --> 0:0:11,86
gave women the right vote. 114 years ago the
Spanish-American war ended, 111 years ago


3
0:0:11,86 --> 0:0:17,76
the first Nobel Prizes were awarded and about
15 seconds ago you started watching CNN STUDENT


4
0:0:17,76 --> 0:0:32,9
NEWS.


5
0:0:32,9 --> 0:0:36,39
Our first story on this Monday edition of
our show: every 48 minutes someone in the


6
0:0:36,39 --> 0:0:41,46
U.S dies in a car wreck that involved a driver
who is either drunk or in some way alcohol-impaired.


7
0:0:41,46 --> 0:0:48,3
It works out to more than 10,000 deaths every
year. Police say Jerry Brown Jr. is one of


8
0:0:48,3 --> 0:0:52,11
them. He was the linebacker on the Dallas
Cowboys practice squad who was killed in a


9
0:0:52,11 --> 0:0:57,27
car crash early Saturday morning. Brown was
a passenger. Police say the car he was in


10
0:0:57,27 --> 0:1:3,129
hit a curb, flipped and caught on fire. Officers
believe alcohol was a contributing factor


11
0:1:3,129 --> 0:1:8,28
in the crash. Cowboys nose tackle Josh Brent
was behind the wheel. He`s been arrested on


12
0:1:8,28 --> 0:1:14,4
suspicion of intoxication- manslaughter. Brent
and Brown were teammates in college, too.


13
0:1:14,4 --> 0:1:20,23
Brent pleaded guilty to a DUI charge in 2009
while he was in school. The charge he is facing


14
0:1:20,23 --> 0:1:27,65
now could lead to a $10,000 fine and a potential
prison sentence of two to 20 years.


15
0:1:27,65 --> 0:1:31,2
Every month the U.S government reports on
the national unemployment rate and the number


16
0:1:31,2 --> 0:1:40,8
of jobs added or lost. For November, 146,000
jobs added. Unemployment at 7.7 percent. That`s


17
0:1:40,8 --> 0:1:44,68
a drop from the month before. And it`s the
lowest the unemployment rate has been in nearly


18
0:1:44,68 --> 0:1:49,71
four years. These numbers can be a little
tricky. The unemployment rate only counts


19
0:1:49,71 --> 0:1:55,11
people actively looking for a job. Experts
say that`s the main reason the rate went down,


20
0:1:55,11 --> 0:2:0,25
is because some people just gave up and stopped
looking. The big number to keep in mind - 12


21
0:2:0,25 --> 0:2:5,5
million. That`s how many Americans were counted
as unemployed in November.


22
0:2:5,5 --> 0:2:9,89
The state legislature in Michigan is getting
ready to vote on a right to work law. A big


23
0:2:9,89 --> 0:2:15,2
part of this story has to do with labor unions.
Right to work laws say that workers don`t


24
0:2:15,2 --> 0:2:20,14
have to join unions or pay union dues. People
who support these laws say they can make a


25
0:2:20,14 --> 0:2:25,2
state more attractive to businesses and can
bring in more money for the state economy.


26
0:2:25,2 --> 0:2:31,32
Critics of the laws say that they make unions
weaker and can keep wages lower for workers.


27
0:2:31,32 --> 0:2:36,25
On this map, the states in blue have a right
to work law. There are 23 of those, including


28
0:2:36,25 --> 0:2:41,32
Indiana, which just passed its legislation
this year. Poppy Harlow got the perspective


29
0:2:41,32 --> 0:2:45,78
from both sides of the debate over the possibility
of a right to work law in Michigan.


30

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


31
0:2:46,32 --> 0:2:51,73
POPPY HARLOW, CNN CORRESPONDENT: A labor representative
told me this legislation is anti-worker, saying


32
0:2:51,73 --> 0:2:54,91
that it gives workers less of a voice. What
do you say to that?


33
0:2:54,91 --> 0:2:58,79
GOV. RICK SNYDER (R ), MICHIGAN: That`s backward.
This is about being pro-worker. Again, giving


34
0:2:58,79 --> 0:3:1,28
workers the choice, the freedom to choose
- that`s fundamental.


35
0:3:1,28 --> 0:3:4,5
JON HOADLEY, WORKING MICHIGAN COALITION CAMPAIGN
MANAGER: So, Governor Snyder`s legislation


36
0:3:4,5 --> 0:3:7,93
is anti-worker, it`s going to end up, you
know, being a devastating blow to the middle


37
0:3:7,93 --> 0:3:8,58
class here.

40
0:3:10,65 --> 0:3:19,68
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Is this legit? The flu
virus is pathogenic. Absolutely. Being pathogenic


41
0:3:19,68 --> 0:3:23,45
means that the virus causes or can cause disease.

0:3:23,45 --> 0:3:25,5
(END VIDEO CLIP)


43
0:3:25,5 --> 0:3:30,72
AZUZ: And there`s a lot of that going around
this year, according to the Centers for Disease


44
0:3:30,72 --> 0:3:35,42
Control and Prevention. For the first time
in almost a decade, the CDC says flu season


45
0:3:35,42 --> 0:3:40,92
has arrived early. The region hardest hit
so far has been the Southern U.S. You can


46
0:3:40,92 --> 0:3:45,12
see how flu activity is spreading on this
map, and you`ll notice the first states to


47
0:3:45,12 --> 0:3:50,43
turn red are in the south. The CDC recommends
that people protect themselves by getting


48
0:3:50,43 --> 0:3:55,73
a flu shot, a vaccine that helps you avoid
catching the flu. But how effective is the


49
0:3:55,73 --> 0:4:0,47
vaccine and how can you the flue in the first
place? Those are a couple of questions I recently


50
0:4:0,47 --> 0:4:2,54
asked CNN`s Dr. Sanjay Gupta.


51
0:4:2,54 --> 0:4:3,3
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


52
0:4:3,3 --> 0:4:7,34
AZUZ: All right, you know, students -they
are touching the same desks, the same door


53
0:4:7,34 --> 0:4:10,849
knobs, the same books. How easily communicated
is the flu through touch?


54
0:4:10,849 --> 0:4:14,15
DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Not as
easily communicated as if you have direct


55
0:4:14,15 --> 0:4:19,34
contact with somebody, but it still can be.
There are some, you know, bacteria out there


56
0:4:19,34 --> 0:4:23,63
that they basically when they hit the air,
they die. With the flu virus, oftentimes,


57
0:4:23,63 --> 0:4:28,88
it can live on a surface for a period of time.
So, doorknobs, for example, a big area of


58
0:4:28,88 --> 0:4:33,26
concern. Desks, as you mentioned. Areas where
people touch their hands a lot. You got - I


59
0:4:33,26 --> 0:4:34,73
mean these areas need to be cleaned.


60
0:4:34,73 --> 0:4:38,2
AZUZ: All right. Is it simple as washing your
hands to get the virus off of them?


61
0:4:38,2 --> 0:4:41,81
GUPTA: Yeah, you know, it sounds almost ridiculously
simple, when you put it like that. But, yeah,


62
0:4:41,81 --> 0:4:47,35
I mean washing your hands can basically protect
you from not only transmitting it to yourself,


63
0:4:47,35 --> 0:4:51,12
touching your hand to your own nose, but also,
you know, giving it to somebody else. It goes


64
0:4:51,12 --> 0:4:54,41
a long way toward doing that and the more
times you wash your hands is better.


65
0:4:54,41 --> 0:4:58,3
AZUZ: All right, let`s say you and I are in
journalism class, and you start sneezing and


66
0:4:58,3 --> 0:5:1,83
saying you are not feeling well. I`m sitting
right next to you. How concerned do I need


67
0:5:1,83 --> 0:5:2,62
to be?


68
0:5:2,62 --> 0:5:6,41
GUPTA: The likelihood, still, even in the
situation like that, is still low, thankfully,


69
0:5:6,41 --> 0:5:10,24
that you are going to get the flu. But, you
know, it`s higher than if you hadn`t been


70
0:5:10,24 --> 0:5:15,28
exposed at all. So, you know, this is a message
I think certainly for people who are sick


71
0:5:15,28 --> 0:5:20,24
and are potentially contagious to stay home
and that`s a big thing. And also, for people,


72
0:5:20,24 --> 0:5:23,86
who are in those situations, to make sure
they are, again, washing their hands often.


73
0:5:23,86 --> 0:5:28,15
AZUZ: With what symptoms should a student
stay home? Like you wake up, you are not feeling


74
0:5:28,15 --> 0:5:30,47
well. At what point should you say I`m not
going to school?


75
0:5:30,47 --> 0:5:34,8
GUPTA: Yeah, you know fever is going to be
one of the things that`s going to be a hallmark,


76
0:5:34,8 --> 0:5:40,15
and usually when you talk about a fever above
101.3, 101.4, that area, that`s really a true


77
0:5:40,15 --> 0:5:44,71
fever. If you have some of the classic symptoms
including sore throat, but also specifically


78
0:5:44,71 --> 0:5:49,24
muscle aches or something that distinguishes
flu from a regular cold. You should probably


79
0:5:49,24 --> 0:5:51,29
stay home with both, that`s when you can tell
the difference.


80
0:5:51,29 --> 0:5:53,55
AZUZ: How effective is a flu shot?


81
0:5:53,55 --> 0:5:57,139
GUPTA: Flu shots can be very effective, you
know, there`s numbers that vary every year,


82
0:5:57,139 --> 0:6:1,84
but it`s in the 70 to 80 percent range, and
it`s not a 100 percent, but it is - it is


83
0:6:1,84 --> 0:6:4,33
pretty good and really the best thing that
we have.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: See if you can I.D. me.
I`m an award that was first given out in the


87
0:6:13,71 --> 0:6:20,44
1930s, I`m named for a former director of
New York`s Downtown Athletic Club. I`m considered


88
0:6:20,44 --> 0:6:25,18
the most prestigious award in college football.


89
0:6:25,18 --> 0:6:33,62
I`m the Heisman Trophy. And some of my most
recent winners include Tim Tebow, Cam Newton


90
0:6:33,62 --> 0:6:35,58
and Robert Griffin III.


91
0:6:35,58 --> 0:6:38,85
(END VIDEO CLIP)


92
0:6:38,85 --> 0:6:43,79
AZUZ: Tebow won the Heisman as a sophomore.
Newton and Griffin were both juniors, and


93
0:6:43,79 --> 0:6:47,85
a lot of seniors have won it over the years.
Now, if we were doing the story last Friday,


94
0:6:47,85 --> 0:6:53,449
we would have said that no freshman had ever
won the Heisman Trophy. Then, this guy came


95
0:6:53,449 --> 0:6:59,37
along. Johnny Manziel, quarterback for Texas
A&M University and this year`s Heisman Trophy


96
0:6:59,37 --> 0:7:4,44
winner. He is the first freshman ever to win
the award. Manziel, whose nickname Johnny


97
0:7:4,44 --> 0:7:10,24
Football, took home the trophy Saturday night.
He passed and ran for a combined 43 touchdowns


98
0:7:10,24 --> 0:7:16,75
this season and accounted for 4600 yards of
total offense. That is the southeastern conference


99
0:7:16,75 --> 0:7:19,4
record.


100
0:7:19,4 --> 0:7:25,63
Next up, the python challenge. It runs January
12th through February 10th in Florida`s Everglades


101
0:7:25,63 --> 0:7:32,889
National Park. Grand Prize is $1500. All you`ve
got to do is find these snakes and kill them.


102
0:7:32,889 --> 0:7:36,38
Florida wildlife officials say they`re turning
to the public for help because they don`t


103
0:7:36,38 --> 0:7:42,1
have a good strategy for the python problem.
The contest, which is real, involves an online


104
0:7:42,1 --> 0:7:47,46
safety training course. Organizers suggest
some human ways to deal with the snakes. They


105
0:7:47,46 --> 0:7:52,43
also say the contest isn`t just about killing
snakes, they also want to educate people on


106
0:7:52,43 --> 0:7:57,229
how the python is affecting Florida. Now,
John Zarrella explains exactly what kinds


107
0:7:57,229 --> 0:8:0,74
of problems these snakes are causing, and
how they got there in the first place.

109
0:8:1,449 --> 0:8:6,479
JOHN ZARELLA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: In his laboratory
Skip Snow keeps in plastic bags what you could


110
0:8:6,479 --> 0:8:13,759
call "the kill:" alligator claws, the hoof
of a deer, a great blue heron, all found in


111
0:8:13,759 --> 0:8:15,47
the stomachs of captured Burmese python.


112
0:8:15,47 --> 0:8:17,83
SKIP SNOW, EVERGLADES NATL. PARK BIOLOGIST:
And it may take us a long time, years, if


113
0:8:17,83 --> 0:8:23,0
not decades, before we fully understand what
the nature of the impacts of Burmese pythons


114
0:8:23,0 --> 0:8:24,38
are in the south Florida.


115
0:8:24,38 --> 0:8:29,6
ZARRELLA: What`s already clear is that some
Everglade species are disappearing, and disappearing


116
0:8:29,6 --> 0:8:29,919
quickly.


117
0:8:29,919 --> 0:8:33,9
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Raccoons were such a
problem that we actually had to put a policy


118
0:8:33,9 --> 0:8:34,309
in place to try to manage them.


119
0:8:34,309 --> 0:8:39,579
ZARRELLA: No policy needed now. A study shows
pythons, which simply aren`t supposed to be


120
0:8:39,579 --> 0:8:46,319
here, are likely responsible for nearly wiping
out several creatures. There may be as many


121
0:8:46,319 --> 0:8:52,649
as 100,000 pythons slithering through the
Glades. How did they get here? Bought as pets,


122
0:8:52,649 --> 0:8:55,879
when they got too big, owners got rid of them.


123
0:8:55,879 --> 0:9:1,139
No one would have guessed just a decade ago,
snakes in this river of grass might upset


124
0:9:1,139 --> 0:9:8,9
the balance of nature here forever. John Zarrella,

126
0:9:8,699 --> 0:9:14,279
AZUZ: We are going to be honest: today`s Before
We Go segment may not pass the sniff test,


127
0:9:14,279 --> 0:9:18,889
but it depends on how hungry you are. That`s
a bottle of perfume, and yes, you are reading


128
0:9:18,889 --> 0:9:25,22
that right - it`s made by Pizza Hut. Smells
like it, too, supposedly. Piquant pepperoni,


129
0:9:25,22 --> 0:9:30,629
malodorous mushroom. Mostly just smells like
a dab of dough. The company is making a limited


130
0:9:30,629 --> 0:9:35,269
supply, free bottles for around 100 people.
If they decided to make more, they`ll probably


131
0:9:35,269 --> 0:9:39,86
just manufacture it down at the old factory.
You may think oh, the pizza sounds odious,


132
0:9:39,86 --> 0:9:44,47
or you may think this perfume idea makes sense
-- who knows for sure. If it becomes a big


133
0:9:44,47 --> 0:9:48,42
seller, everyone`s is going to want a piece
of that pie. For CNN STUDENT NEWS, I`m Carl


134
