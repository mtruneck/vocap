0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:1,18



2
0:0:1,18 --> 0:0:3,8
BRAYDEN OLSON: Hey, my name's
Brayden, and I'm going to the


3
0:0:3,8 --> 0:0:6,88
Westminster Dog Show at Madison
Square Garden on acid.


4
0:0:6,88 --> 0:0:25,73



5
0:0:25,73 --> 0:0:27,278
See you guys tomorrow,
or later today.


6
0:0:27,278 --> 0:0:30,35



7
0:0:30,35 --> 0:0:31,6
Whoa, look at that smoke.


8
0:0:31,6 --> 0:0:35,92



9
0:0:35,92 --> 0:0:37,4
JONATHAN SMITH: So how many
times have you tripped


10
0:0:37,4 --> 0:0:38,51
acid in your life?


11
0:0:38,51 --> 0:0:39,54
BRAYDEN OLSON: Zero.


12
0:0:39,54 --> 0:0:40,22
JONATHAN SMITH: Zero times.


13
0:0:40,22 --> 0:0:41,48
So today's the first time.


14
0:0:41,48 --> 0:0:43,135
BRAYDEN OLSON: But I've
never been to a dog


15
0:0:43,135 --> 0:0:44,25
show, either, so.


16
0:0:44,25 --> 0:0:45,22
JONATHAN SMITH: So
it's two firsts.


17
0:0:45,22 --> 0:0:46,78
BRAYDEN OLSON: It's two--


18
0:0:46,78 --> 0:0:48,35
two new things for me today.


19
0:0:48,35 --> 0:0:50,23
JONATHAN SMITH: There's actually
going to be 986 dogs


20
0:0:50,23 --> 0:0:51,74
competing today.


21
0:0:51,74 --> 0:0:53,16
BRAYDEN OLSON: That's
a lot of digs.


22
0:0:53,16 --> 0:0:54,11
JONATHAN SMITH: What do you
think it's going to be like,


23
0:0:54,11 --> 0:0:56,27
tripping for the first
time at the biggest


24
0:0:56,27 --> 0:0:57,24
dog show in the world?


25
0:0:57,24 --> 0:0:58,49
BRAYDEN OLSON: I think it would
be fun to go there not


26
0:0:58,49 --> 0:1:1,69
on acid, so on acid it's
probably gonna be amazing.


27
0:1:1,69 --> 0:1:2,4
JONATHAN SMITH: Yeah.


28
0:1:2,4 --> 0:1:2,79
It's gonna be way better.


29
0:1:2,79 --> 0:1:3,78
BRAYDEN OLSON: Yeah.


30
0:1:3,78 --> 0:1:6,43
I'm gonna try and find
dogs with good vibes.


31
0:1:6,43 --> 0:1:9,11
Fluffy dogs.


32
0:1:9,11 --> 0:1:10,1
Nice dogs.


33
0:1:10,1 --> 0:1:12,75
I'm kind of scared of
seeing a Greyhound.


34
0:1:12,75 --> 0:1:15,28



35
0:1:15,28 --> 0:1:17,22
JONATHAN SMITH: What are your
three favorite dog names?


36
0:1:17,22 --> 0:1:20,11



37
0:1:20,11 --> 0:1:22,3
BRAYDEN OLSON: I'm not really
for naming animals.


38
0:1:22,3 --> 0:1:22,63
JONATHAN SMITH: Not at all?


39
0:1:22,63 --> 0:1:23,972
BRAYDEN OLSON: No, not really.


40
0:1:23,972 --> 0:1:25,92
JONATHAN SMITH: How are
you feeling right now?


41
0:1:25,92 --> 0:1:27,5
BRAYDEN OLSON: Feel good.


42
0:1:27,5 --> 0:1:27,32
JONATHAN SMITH: Yeah?


43
0:1:27,32 --> 0:1:27,61
BRAYDEN OLSON: Yeah.


44
0:1:27,61 --> 0:1:28,31
JONATHAN SMITH: You
seeing anything?


45
0:1:28,31 --> 0:1:29,47
Is it--


46
0:1:29,47 --> 0:1:31,34
have butterflies in your
stomach or anything?


47
0:1:31,34 --> 0:1:31,79
BRAYDEN OLSON: No.


48
0:1:31,79 --> 0:1:34,255
I feel totally, like, relaxed.


49
0:1:34,255 --> 0:1:40,1



50
0:1:40,1 --> 0:1:42,6
It's like there's a lot of
fucking birds out here.


51
0:1:42,6 --> 0:1:42,955
JONATHAN SMITH: Yeah.


52
0:1:42,955 --> 0:1:44,87
There's actually no birds
around at all.


53
0:1:44,87 --> 0:1:46,11
BRAYDEN OLSON: There's
birds over there.


54
0:1:46,11 --> 0:1:48,151
There's birds on that thing.


55
0:1:48,151 --> 0:1:50,31
There's birds on that roof.


56
0:1:50,31 --> 0:1:52,836
They're all making noise.


57
0:1:52,836 --> 0:1:56,79
[LAUGHS]


58
0:1:56,79 --> 0:2:0,8
On the roof, I heard a lot of
birds chirping like crazy.


59
0:2:0,8 --> 0:2:4,54
Things slowly started
getting confusing.


60
0:2:4,54 --> 0:2:7,42
It heightens your senses.


61
0:2:7,42 --> 0:2:9,55
You can hear, like, sounds
from really far away.


62
0:2:9,55 --> 0:2:13,33
And things that aren't
necessarily really interesting


63
0:2:13,33 --> 0:2:16,87
are just extremely
interesting.


64
0:2:16,87 --> 0:2:17,485
JONATHAN SMITH: Let's go.


65
0:2:17,485 --> 0:2:19,53
Let's do this.


66
0:2:19,53 --> 0:2:21,32
BRAYDEN OLSON: We got into a
car, which I was not excited


67
0:2:21,32 --> 0:2:23,97
about, after we left the roof.


68
0:2:23,97 --> 0:2:28,89
Taking acid in New York is a
little bit crazier than taking


69
0:2:28,89 --> 0:2:31,809
acid, let's say, like on a lake
or in the woods, which I


70
0:2:31,809 --> 0:2:33,78
would prefer.


71
0:2:33,78 --> 0:2:36,38
There's nowhere to go anywhere
in New York where there's no


72
0:2:36,38 --> 0:2:40,13
one at, especially at Madison
Square Garden.


73
0:2:40,13 --> 0:2:40,94
You're stuck there.


74
0:2:40,94 --> 0:2:42,323
So you have to enjoy it.


75
0:2:42,323 --> 0:2:46,4



76
0:2:46,4 --> 0:2:49,7
When we got there, we had
absolutely no idea what we


77
0:2:49,7 --> 0:2:50,32
were going to do.


78
0:2:50,32 --> 0:3:3,98



79
0:3:3,98 --> 0:3:7,274
That dog is crazy.


80
0:3:7,274 --> 0:3:8,75
Oh my god.


81
0:3:8,75 --> 0:3:12,69



82
0:3:12,69 --> 0:3:17,69
It was sort of freeing to just
be that dumb and to just take


83
0:3:17,69 --> 0:3:20,48
everything in and be
like, it's OK.


84
0:3:20,48 --> 0:3:22,0
I know that I'm on drugs.


85
0:3:22,0 --> 0:3:27,24



86
0:3:27,24 --> 0:3:30,81
I was just very aware of where
I was at and the types of


87
0:3:30,81 --> 0:3:34,28
people that I could
go and talk to.


88
0:3:34,28 --> 0:3:38,3
We're here at the 136th
Westminster Dog Show.


89
0:3:38,3 --> 0:3:43,24
And we're going to talk to
Clyde Barry, who's a very


90
0:3:43,24 --> 0:3:46,46
well-known dog owner.


91
0:3:46,46 --> 0:3:47,93
Excuse me.


92
0:3:47,93 --> 0:3:49,274
Would you mind--?


93
0:3:49,274 --> 0:3:51,23
JEFF BRUCKER: One--
one second, Gary.


94
0:3:51,23 --> 0:3:52,82
BRAYDEN OLSON: Sorry,
what was your name?


95
0:3:52,82 --> 0:3:53,18
JEFF BRUCKER: Jeff Brucker.


96
0:3:53,18 --> 0:3:55,5
BRAYDEN OLSON: Jeff-- oh, I
thought you were someone else.


97
0:3:55,5 --> 0:3:55,493
JEFF BRUCKER: No.


98
0:3:55,493 --> 0:3:55,936
I'm not.


99
0:3:55,936 --> 0:3:58,35
BRAYDEN OLSON: I'm sorry.


100
0:3:58,35 --> 0:4:0,93
Wasn't him.


101
0:4:0,93 --> 0:4:4,94
I definitely took advantage of
the press pass, because you


102
0:4:4,94 --> 0:4:7,95
could-- basically, you had free
rein on the whole place


103
0:4:7,95 --> 0:4:10,47
to do whatever I wanted,
'cause we had a camera.


104
0:4:10,47 --> 0:4:11,79
So people would talk to you.


105
0:4:11,79 --> 0:4:13,22
You were like validated.


106
0:4:13,22 --> 0:4:14,47
It was pretty empowering.


107
0:4:14,47 --> 0:4:16,47



108
0:4:16,47 --> 0:4:18,55
BRAYDEN OLSON: These two
ladies know more


109
0:4:18,55 --> 0:4:20,19
about dogs than I do.


110
0:4:20,19 --> 0:4:23,91
First of all, do you both--


111
0:4:23,91 --> 0:4:23,96
do you both--


112
0:4:23,96 --> 0:4:24,39
FEMALE SPEAKER 1: Breed.


113
0:4:24,39 --> 0:4:25,3
BRAYDEN OLSON: Do you
both breed dogs?


114
0:4:25,3 --> 0:4:26,62
FEMALE SPEAKER 1:
We both breed--


115
0:4:26,62 --> 0:4:27,345
BRAYDEN OLSON: Are
you both doggers?


116
0:4:27,345 --> 0:4:28,84
FEMALE SPEAKER 2: Yes.


117
0:4:28,84 --> 0:4:29,86
FEMALE SPEAKER 1: We're
both dog people.


118
0:4:29,86 --> 0:4:30,47
BRAYDEN OLSON: Is that a term?


119
0:4:30,47 --> 0:4:31,7
Doggers?


120
0:4:31,7 --> 0:4:31,75
FEMALE SPEAKER 1: No.


121
0:4:31,75 --> 0:4:32,55
Dog people.


122
0:4:32,55 --> 0:4:33,22
BRAYDEN OLSON: Dog people.


123
0:4:33,22 --> 0:4:35,14
The lighting's really
nice in here.


124
0:4:35,14 --> 0:4:35,76
FEMALE SPEAKER 3: Yes.


125
0:4:35,76 --> 0:4:37,6
BRAYDEN OLSON: Makes it
nice to take photos.


126
0:4:37,6 --> 0:4:38,12
And the colors.


127
0:4:38,12 --> 0:4:39,4
Are you here just
to see the dogs?


128
0:4:39,4 --> 0:4:40,15
DOG HANDLER: No,
I'm a handler.


129
0:4:40,15 --> 0:4:41,195
BRAYDEN OLSON: Oh, you are?


130
0:4:41,195 --> 0:4:42,43
You're definitely the prettiest


131
0:4:42,43 --> 0:4:43,565
girl at the dog show.


132
0:4:43,565 --> 0:4:44,555
DOG HANDLER: Oh, thank you.


133
0:4:44,555 --> 0:4:47,3
Thanks.


134
0:4:47,3 --> 0:4:48,48
BRAYDEN OLSON NARRATING: I
really liked the older man who


135
0:4:48,48 --> 0:4:52,89
told me the joke about how women
at cat shows are fatter.


136
0:4:52,89 --> 0:4:55,1
MALE SPEAKER 1: You know, the
difference between a dog show


137
0:4:55,1 --> 0:4:58,54
and a cat show is that at a cat
show, the women are really


138
0:4:58,54 --> 0:5:1,16
heavy, because you don't
have to run the cats.


139
0:5:1,16 --> 0:5:4,41
And at a dog show, people
are a lot slimmer.


140
0:5:4,41 --> 0:5:6,85
So I've come to the conclusion,
dog shows are


141
0:5:6,85 --> 0:5:8,884
healthier than cat shows.


142
0:5:8,884 --> 0:5:10,62
[BLOWS IN MIC]


143
0:5:10,62 --> 0:5:12,4
BRAYDEN OLSON: There wasn't
really press walking around


144
0:5:12,4 --> 0:5:14,465
and just asking people
questions, so they probably


145
0:5:14,465 --> 0:5:16,43
thought I was like
really official.


146
0:5:16,43 --> 0:5:18,54
So I felt like I could go up
to anyone and just sort of


147
0:5:18,54 --> 0:5:21,72
play with their head and just
do whatever I wanted.


148
0:5:21,72 --> 0:5:27,6



149
0:5:27,6 --> 0:5:29,91
Can I ask you a few questions
about the show?


150
0:5:29,91 --> 0:5:30,11
FEMALE SPEAKER 4: Sure.


151
0:5:30,11 --> 0:5:32,67
BRAYDEN OLSON: Just about
what your name, and--


152
0:5:32,67 --> 0:5:34,22
FEMALE SPEAKER 4: OK.


153
0:5:34,22 --> 0:5:35,37
BRAYDEN OLSON: Is she
wearing a diaper?


154
0:5:35,37 --> 0:5:37,87
FEMALE SPEAKER 5: She's
wearing, um, a panty.


155
0:5:37,87 --> 0:5:38,47
BRAYDEN OLSON: A panty.


156
0:5:38,47 --> 0:5:38,75
FEMALE SPEAKER 5: Yeah.


157
0:5:38,75 --> 0:5:39,37
She's-- time of the month.


158
0:5:39,37 --> 0:5:40,365
BRAYDEN OLSON: That's
a little sexier.


159
0:5:40,365 --> 0:5:41,33
FEMALE SPEAKER 5: Yeah.


160
0:5:41,33 --> 0:5:43,8
BRAYDEN OLSON: I didn't know
dogs had a time of the month.


161
0:5:43,8 --> 0:5:43,68
FEMALE SPEAKER 5: They do.


162
0:5:43,68 --> 0:5:44,62
About every six months.


163
0:5:44,62 --> 0:5:45,56
BRAYDEN OLSON: I didn't
know that.


164
0:5:45,56 --> 0:5:46,5
FEMALE SPEAKER 5: Yep.


165
0:5:46,5 --> 0:5:47,5
BRAYDEN OLSON: That's like
a time of the year.


166
0:5:47,5 --> 0:5:48,45
FEMALE SPEAKER 5: Time
of the year.


167
0:5:48,45 --> 0:5:48,705
Yes.


168
0:5:48,705 --> 0:5:49,666

172
0:5:51,98 --> 0:5:53,16
BRAYDEN OLSON: And
you are you with?


173

MATT STANDER: Dog News.


174
0:5:53,75 --> 0:5:54,42
BRAYDEN OLSON: Dog News.


175
0:5:54,42 --> 0:5:57,28
Um, I don't know much about
Dog News, but if you could


176
0:5:57,28 --> 0:5:59,3
tell us a little bit about
what you guys do--


177
0:5:59,3 --> 0:6:0,56
MATT STANDER: It's a vertical
publication for


178
0:6:0,56 --> 0:6:1,525
the show-going public.


179
0:6:1,525 --> 0:6:5,21
It's been printed weekly
for the last 28 years.


180
0:6:5,21 --> 0:6:5,635
BRAYDEN OLSON: Wow.


181
0:6:5,635 --> 0:6:6,91
OK.


182
0:6:6,91 --> 0:6:7,44
That's about it.


183
0:6:7,44 --> 0:6:8,2
MATT STANDER: That do it?


184
0:6:8,2 --> 0:6:8,88
BRAYDEN OLSON: Yeah.


185
0:6:8,88 --> 0:6:10,13
Thank you.


186
0:6:10,13 --> 0:6:13,11



187
0:6:13,11 --> 0:6:16,29
I started to get more and more
confused as it started taking


188
0:6:16,29 --> 0:6:17,75
effect more.


189
0:6:17,75 --> 0:6:19,44
MALE SPEAKER 2: Well,
it depends.


190
0:6:19,44 --> 0:6:21,95
Some years, sometimes
they'll go for--


191
0:6:21,95 --> 0:6:23,33
BRAYDEN OLSON: There was a point
where I was just, like,


192
0:6:23,33 --> 0:6:26,32
holding a microphone and had no
idea what they were saying.


193
0:6:26,32 --> 0:6:27,75
Like I could see them talking.


194
0:6:27,75 --> 0:6:29,4
I could hear it.


195
0:6:29,4 --> 0:6:31,35
But none of it made sense.


196
0:6:31,35 --> 0:6:32,77
There was this fan there.


197
0:6:32,77 --> 0:6:35,55
I think it was coming from the
top, but it was just, like,


198
0:6:35,55 --> 0:6:38,642
blowing my face.

0:6:42,926 --> 0:6:44,295
BRAYDEN OLSON: It's
pretty good.


201
0:6:44,295 --> 0:6:46,63
I actually don't
want to leave.

[WIND IN MICROPHONE]


204
0:6:50,0 --> 0:6:51,53
BRAYDEN OLSON: I remember
thinking it felt like I was in


205
0:6:51,53 --> 0:6:54,16
a desert and there was,
like, sand whipping


206
0:6:54,16 --> 0:6:55,26
around me and stuff.


207
0:6:55,26 --> 0:6:57,866
And it was one of the best
feelings, and I was trying to


208
0:6:57,866 --> 0:6:58,79
do interviews in it.


209
0:6:58,79 --> 0:7:0,26
It was so horrible.


210
0:7:0,26 --> 0:7:2,224
FEMALE SPEAKER 6: Today we
showed Black Russian terriers,


211
0:7:2,224 --> 0:7:5,17
Norfolk terriers, Brittanys,
Vizslas,


212
0:7:5,17 --> 0:7:6,643
Goldens, and Labradors.


213
0:7:6,643 --> 0:7:7,625
BRAYDEN OLSON: Oh my god.


214
0:7:7,625 --> 0:7:13,3
[APPLAUSE]


215
0:7:13,3 --> 0:7:14,7
BRAYDEN OLSON: I just
walked around and


216
0:7:14,7 --> 0:7:16,56
ended up in the bleachers.


217
0:7:16,56 --> 0:7:18,496
I was kind of alone,
but like, there was


218
0:7:18,496 --> 0:7:19,17
tons of people around.


219
0:7:19,17 --> 0:7:20,783
So I kind of spaced out
for a while, and


220
0:7:20,783 --> 0:7:23,38
that was really nice.


221
0:7:23,38 --> 0:7:27,69
I was tripping the hardest
probably when I was sitting in


222
0:7:27,69 --> 0:7:31,1
the bleachers by myself.


223
0:7:31,1 --> 0:7:34,14
The ceiling had all these crazy
lights, and I remember


224
0:7:34,14 --> 0:7:35,67
kind of tripping out, looking
at the lights.


225
0:7:35,67 --> 0:7:38,465
And it just felt really
good and comforting.


226
0:7:38,465 --> 0:7:49,62



227
0:7:49,62 --> 0:7:50,955
I like your shirt.


228
0:7:50,955 --> 0:7:51,31
MALE SPEAKER 3: Thank you.


229
0:7:51,31 --> 0:7:54,16
BRAYDEN OLSON: It's
a good one.


230
0:7:54,16 --> 0:7:57,0
I came away with a new
appreciation for dog owners.


231
0:7:57,0 --> 0:7:59,72
They're very serious
about their dogs.


232
0:7:59,72 --> 0:8:1,63
It's like their child.


233
0:8:1,63 --> 0:8:3,52
And it's their life.


234
0:8:3,52 --> 0:8:4,56
That's what they live for.


235
0:8:4,56 --> 0:8:8,394
What's your favorite thing
about this dog?


236
0:8:8,394 --> 0:8:9,38
FEMALE SPEAKER 7: Everything.


237
0:8:9,38 --> 0:8:10,21
BRAYDEN OLSON: Everything?


238
0:8:10,21 --> 0:8:10,48
No.


239
0:8:10,48 --> 0:8:12,8
You have to pick one thing.


240
0:8:12,8 --> 0:8:12,365
FEMALE SPEAKER 7: One thing?


241
0:8:12,365 --> 0:8:13,88
His-- his personality.


242
0:8:13,88 --> 0:8:15,2
BRAYDEN OLSON: Yeah?


243
0:8:15,2 --> 0:8:15,95
He's a sweet dog?


244
0:8:15,95 --> 0:8:17,17
FEMALE SPEAKER 7: He's
an excellent dog.


245
0:8:17,17 --> 0:8:19,114
This is what he loves to do.


246
0:8:19,114 --> 0:8:20,572
BRAYDEN OLSON: Hey.


247
0:8:20,572 --> 0:8:23,5
FEMALE SPEAKER 7: He's saying
he loves to show.


248
0:8:23,5 --> 0:8:25,757
BRAYDEN OLSON: I like dogs, but
not like on that level.


249
0:8:25,757 --> 0:8:27,7
So.


250
0:8:27,7 --> 0:8:31,49



251
0:8:31,49 --> 0:8:33,539
I remember tripping,
but it's weird.


252
0:8:33,539 --> 0:8:36,539
I don't remember a lot of it.


253
0:8:36,539 --> 0:8:39,216
I just remember bits
and pieces and


254
0:8:39,216 --> 0:8:40,57
being really confused.


255
0:8:40,57 --> 0:8:41,44
I didn't really have visuals.


256
0:8:41,44 --> 0:8:43,63
Like things were a little
brighter and stuff, but there


257
0:8:43,63 --> 0:8:46,0
wasn't-- like dogs weren't like
flying through the air.


258
0:8:46,0 --> 0:8:47,33
Which is what--


259
0:8:47,33 --> 0:8:48,78
I kind of hoped that
would happen.


260
0:8:48,78 --> 0:8:49,64
But I kind of--


261
0:8:49,64 --> 0:8:51,9
I'm glad it didn't, 'cause I
probably would've really


262
0:8:51,9 --> 0:8:52,17
freaked out.


263
0:8:52,17 --> 0:8:55,52
The cool thing is, I never
had a bad experience.


264
0:8:55,52 --> 0:8:58,76
I was kind of scared that I
was gonna freak out, but I


265
0:8:58,76 --> 0:8:59,42
didn't at all.


266
0:8:59,42 --> 0:9:1,5
I had, like, an amazing time.


267
0:9:1,5 --> 0:9:6,597
Definitely a overall good
experience on acid.


268
0:9:6,597 --> 0:9:7,847
Sorry, Mom.


269
0:9:7,847 --> 0:9:12,23



270
0:9:12,23 --> 0:9:14,89
We did like 10 takes of trying
to like walk out the door.


271
0:9:14,89 --> 0:9:19,78
And I just remember
it was so hard.


272
0:9:19,78 --> 0:9:20,22
JONATHAN SMITH: Come on, dude.


273
0:9:20,22 --> 0:9:20,966
Come on!


274
0:9:20,966 --> 0:9:22,18
Oh, Jesus Christ.


275
0:9:22,18 --> 0:9:23,81
BRAYDEN OLSON: I was sort of
scared that I wasn't gonna


276
0:9:23,81 --> 0:9:25,199
leave, though, at a point.


277
0:9:25,199 --> 0:9:27,514
I was like, am I gonna
be like this forever?


278
0:9:27,514 --> 0:11:27,514
