1
0:0:0,149 --> 0:0:4,56
now we told you before about wilcox
county high school in


2
0:0:4,56 --> 0:0:8,829
and this is amazing situation where they
have segregated props


3
0:0:8,829 --> 0:0:10,19
they have a vote


4
0:0:10,19 --> 0:0:11,469
white primal


5
0:0:11,469 --> 0:0:15,36
that sounds like a mile and must have it
in nineteen sixty nine or


6
0:0:15,36 --> 0:0:17,72
or maybe there are other than that
nineteen forty nine


7
0:0:17,72 --> 0:0:21,669
now it's happening today inside a
biracial student trying to show of last


8
0:0:21,669 --> 0:0:22,56
year


9
0:0:22,56 --> 0:0:27,269
i was kicked out escorted away by the
police and the police and forces now


10
0:0:27,269 --> 0:0:31,579
it's not suddenly run by this as
students is run by a parent organization


11
0:0:31,579 --> 0:0:34,5
but the cops in force it


12
0:0:34,5 --> 0:0:38,25
four students came together so that we
should do and integrated prom it's


13
0:0:38,25 --> 0:0:39,91
twenty thirteen


14
0:0:39,91 --> 0:0:42,339
can we set out of the time machine for a
second


15
0:0:42,339 --> 0:0:44,46
and get real here


16
0:0:44,46 --> 0:0:48,33
uh... it turns out a lot of people are
resisting this including the governor of


17
0:0:48,33 --> 0:0:52,15
georgia i'll get to in a second but for
c_b_s_ us to the school


18
0:0:52,15 --> 0:0:56,1
akamai university journalists went there
as reported back wall


19
0:0:56,1 --> 0:0:59,7
white students in the back during class
wake


20
0:0:59,7 --> 0:1:1,15
uh... while black kids in the front


21
0:1:1,15 --> 0:1:2,109
lots of interesting


22
0:1:2,109 --> 0:1:3,139
change of pace


23
0:1:3,139 --> 0:1:4,84
mistakes which positions


24
0:1:4,84 --> 0:1:8,29
black kids have lunch outside while the
white kids have there is in the yard


25
0:1:8,29 --> 0:1:13,17
white students particularly girls who
deep black students recipient ostracized


26
0:1:13,17 --> 0:1:14,48
emboli


27
0:1:14,48 --> 0:1:15,52
now look


28
0:1:15,52 --> 0:1:19,16
either way since the blacks in sometime
soon apart a lot of different schools


29
0:1:19,16 --> 0:1:22,99
but there seems to be something that is
enforced throughout all these decades


30
0:1:22,99 --> 0:1:23,93
and we know


31
0:1:23,93 --> 0:1:26,87
if you're black or even biracial each
other show up to that problem


32
0:1:26,87 --> 0:1:27,87
it take you out


33
0:1:27,87 --> 0:1:32,88
so there's no question about that's the
case here


34
0:1:32,88 --> 0:1:36,8
is a people fighting bag yes and now
whose small credit by the way position


35
0:1:36,8 --> 0:1:38,409
be fairly obvious


36
0:1:38,409 --> 0:1:40,159
or trying to fix the situation


37
0:1:40,159 --> 0:1:44,5
and there are seven uh... people some of
the georgia state representatives formed


38
0:1:44,5 --> 0:1:48,52
president truman republicans who are
saying


39
0:1:48,52 --> 0:1:50,6
misfortune places


40
0:1:50,6 --> 0:1:53,77
amman but what of the president was not
among them


41
0:1:53,77 --> 0:1:57,7
is governor mason deal of george


42
0:1:57,7 --> 0:2:0,67
is a man you see pictured here


43
0:2:0,67 --> 0:2:2,37
when asked about this


44
0:2:2,37 --> 0:2:8,129
he said the groups trying to integrate
the races in that high school are quote


45
0:2:8,129 --> 0:2:10,389
a leftist font group


46
0:2:10,389 --> 0:2:13,989
for the state democratic board


47
0:2:13,989 --> 0:2:15,21
okay you know what nathan


48
0:2:15,21 --> 0:2:16,519
fine you would


49
0:2:16,519 --> 0:2:20,789
democrats are for integration
republicans


50
0:2:20,789 --> 0:2:24,899
segregation in the year twenty thirty
began to be fair not all republicans


51
0:2:24,899 --> 0:2:28,359
even george arsenal state reps are
against us


52
0:2:28,359 --> 0:2:32,69
apparently have some sense that nathan
deal doesn't but look at this time warp


53
0:2:32,69 --> 0:2:33,42
is stuck in that time


54
0:2:33,42 --> 0:2:37,599
this guy some things like our budget
leftist more than that it is coming in


55
0:2:37,599 --> 0:2:39,81
here china integrators


56
0:2:39,81 --> 0:2:41,579
the racist to your magic


57
0:2:41,579 --> 0:2:43,389
and the same for all


58
0:2:43,389 --> 0:2:45,749
he's not done yet he says quote


59
0:2:45,749 --> 0:2:52,259
we're not going to lend a hand to this
silly publicity stuff


60
0:2:52,259 --> 0:2:54,609
this silly publicity stunt


61
0:2:54,609 --> 0:2:58,579
trying to integrate the races in georgia
however here


62
0:2:58,579 --> 0:3:2,209
every time we knew the story would be
another twice


63
0:3:2,209 --> 0:3:5,699
first original story now the hopi with
nathan deal


64
0:3:5,699 --> 0:3:9,849
can't believe it's the year twenty
thirteen and these guys still think this


65
0:3:9,849 --> 0:3:10,829
way


66
0:3:10,829 --> 0:3:13,189
has probably cuz i'm way to ninety


67
0:3:13,189 --> 0:3:15,25
fighting grew up in a situation like
that


68
0:3:15,25 --> 0:3:20,76
so when i see this a government united
states state this day and age saying how


69
0:3:20,76 --> 0:3:23,79
you and your publicity stunts


70
0:3:23,79 --> 0:3:26,8
with your left this don't strive
integrate the races


71
0:3:26,8 --> 0:3:27,679
unacceptable


72
0:3:27,679 --> 0:3:29,39
i'm shocked by it


73
0:3:29,39 --> 0:3:30,219
i hope to it


74
0:3:30,219 --> 0:3:34,1
voters in georgia rashad by and they
never make the mistake of reelected


75
0:3:34,1 --> 0:5:34,1
nathan deal again
