###14 One cannot deny, I suppose, that murder has its uses in society.
###19 But I must say that in the past,
###21 it has been pursued with more enthusiasm than accuracy.
###28 Explosive devices certainly went off, but usually in the wrong place...
###35 ...at the right time,
###38 or the right place at the wrong time.
###45 Quite suddenly, all this inefficiency became a thing of the past.
###49 Murders began to be committed with a sort of unholy precision.
###56 A comprehensive service was now being offered by
###60 the Assassination Bureau... Limited.
###159 This is from your own paper, two weeks ago.
###163 There is only one common factor in these killings: Ruthless efficiency.
###167 No social or political bias, just murder as a fine art.
###172 "Mesopotamia"? What the devil does that mean?
###174 Personal Column of The Times, three weeks before Alderman J.T. Langer
###178 was blown up by an exploding casket.
###182 Berliner Morgenpost, two weeks before Count von Kissen
###185 fell down the lift shaft at the Adlon Hotel.
###189 - Our own paper. - Good heavens.
###191 One week before the affair of the exploding Bible.
###194 I believe this is how prospective clients contact this organization.
###198 Employ me, and you can have my story.
###201 But that's our paper again.
###203 Find out who placed it. Get to Small Ads!
###205 Pray, don't bother. I know who placed it.
###207 - Who? - I did.
###210 The ad has been answered, my name and address supplied.
###213 I expect them to get in touch with me at any moment.
###215 - Splendid. Splendid! - My lord.
###218 You certainly are the New Woman incarnate, Miss Winter.
###221 I slipped in unobserved so Miss Winter would talk freely.
###224 I always talk freely. Who are you?
###226 This is Lord Bostwick, the owner of our newspaper.
###229 How do you do?
###231 The newspaper business is a male preserve.
###233 If you are plotting to breach the citadel, it should be done in privacy. Come.
###241 Sit down. Sit down.
###244 Put you to work in this office, and they'd all walk out.
###247 But they'd leap to take you out to dinner.
###250 Why should they ask me out to dinner?
###252 Because you are a very attractive young woman.
###254 There can be no sexual equality whilst women exploit their appearance.
###258 I rigidly avoid it.
###259 Yes, well, this lift will take us to my office.
###265 - Allow me to offer you a little reviver. - I touch no spirituous liquor.
###270 I should hope not. This is a fine Madeira.
###273 I have a partiality for it, just as I have for adventurous women.
###276 What, then, is your reaction to my proposal?
###279 That this newspaper should support you to the full extent of its resources.
###283 It is truly wonderful to find someone as
###286 liberal as yourself in a position of power and authority.
###289 Yes, indeed. It's not at all common.
###292 My newspapers are only a means to an end.
###295 I have a genuine concern for the political welfare of the world.
###299 You'd be astonished if I told you of the courts in Europe where I wield power.
###303 Behind the thrones, of course. I am a retiring man.
###306 It will be an honor to work for you.
###308 I'd like to keep it a secret between us.
###310 - Why? - Because, Miss Winter,
###312 if there's truth to what you say, I'd be a marked man for supporting you.
###316 - I see. - You'll have to be satisfied,
###319 - with the thin end of the wedge. - Very well.
###321 I want your employment, and need your resources behind me.
###324 In that case, sit down and tell me a little bit about your plan.
###328 I must admit that one thing intrigues me.
###330 - And what is that? - Apart from your desire
###333 to prove women's equality with men, what is your object in contacting
###337 - these organized assassins? - Surely that's obvious.
###341 I want someone assassinated.
###356 - Oh, I'm so sorry. - That's all right, lady. I'm used to it.
###361 - Your matches. - It doesn't matter.
###363 I've lost me eyes, lady, but I've still got my pride.
###367 Yes, of course.
###379 "Mr. Pemberty's bowler."
###404 Pardon me, madam. Are you being attended to?
###407 No. I've come to collect Mr. Pemberty's bowler.
###411 - Mr. Pemberty's? - Yes.
###414 Very hard-wearing felt, madam, from Mesopotamia.
###418 I am sure Mr. Pemberty will be pleased with it.
###421 Oh, I'm sure he will.
###423 If you would care to take it, we will deliver it for you.
###429 This way, madam.
###460 Just through here, madam.
###465 I must apologize for the lack of amenities,
###468 but we don't usually cater for lady customers.
###470 However, the journey will not take long.
###506 Whoa.
###508 Back. Back.
###512 Whoa.
###523 This way, madam.
###525 These cloak-and-dagger precautions are an unfortunate necessity.
###529 We try and keep them to a minimum.
###568 Forgive me. A test for our customers. We're not used to dealing with ladies.
###574 - Evidently. - An interesting reaction.
###576 Men come on gruesome business, yet without exception
###579 they are frightened out of their wits by a whiff of gunpowder.
###583 You seem to be made of sterner stuff. Will you please be seated?
###590 Miss Winter, you are not married.
###592 You have, as far as we can ascertain, no romantic associations.
###596 Whom, other than a husband or lover, could a young lady wish to kill?
###600 - You know a lot about me. - Naturally, or you'd not be here.
###603 At least may I know whom I am addressing?
###606 Certainly. I am lvan Dragomiloff. Oh, don't be put off by the name.
###611 My father's Russian sentimentality has been counteracted by
###614 - an English public school education. - Are you head of this organization?
###618 - Certainly. - You look extremely young.
###621 Oh, don't let that worry you. I was born and bred for the job.
###624 - That's terrible. - It's not terrible.
###626 My father brought me up to continue his life work.
###629 It's natural for a son to inherit the family business.
###632 Business? You're murderers.
###634 Our proper title is the Assassination Bureau, Limited.
###638 - Our dividends are quite substantial. - You admit you take life for money.
###642 Money is life, don't you agree? The lack of it has killed more people
###646 one way or another than 100 Assassination Bureaus.
###649 Human life is possibly the most expendable commodity we possess.
###653 It's so easily replaced, and so pleasurably.
###662 This is fantastic. You're a monster.
###664 No. My father only saw to it that I was educated in the logic of my profession.
###669 - He was somewhat of a philosopher. - I'm not interested in him.
###673 - May we get down to business? - Certainly. Please be seated.
###676 Very well, then. What about your fees?
###679 Oh, we have a sliding scale, according to the importance of the victim.
###683 Quality is always worth paying for. We have very high overheads.
###686 Since taking over, I have tried to completely modernize our methods.
###690 This, after all, is the age of science.
###693 Take, for instance, this little bomb.
###695 We've just issued it to all our branches.
###698 It can be timed to go off at any hour one chooses.
###704 And its tick is no louder than a normal clock.
###707 Switched off, it's as harmless as your pocket watch...
###711 ...unless you drop it, of course. Miss Winter, please don't be shy.
###715 Confide in me as you would in a doctor or a priest.
###719 Whom do you wish to kill?
###721 You will undertake this assignment, Mr. Dragomiloff?
###724 I shall want justification. Of what sins is he guilty?
###728 Pride.
###732 - Avarice. - Oh, dear, dear.
###735 And murder.
###738 He seems a suitable candidate.
###741 You guarantee that he will be killed?
###743 You have my word.
###746 The name, please.
###748 Very well, then. His name is...
###754 ...lvan Dragomiloff.
###760 I shall need further identification.
###764 He is of Russian extraction, though educated in England.
###769 Physical characteristics?
###771 Approximately your size, weight and age.
###774 I was born in the province of Valenko. Where was your man born?
###780 In the province of Valenko.
###790 I am compelled to believe that you mean me.
###796 I do.
###797 You puzzle me, Miss Winter.
###799 We've never met, yet you want my life. Why? Why?
###803 Because of my organization?
###805 Because you believe "kill me, kill my bureau." Is that it? Is that it?!
###814 What an absolutely marvelous idea.
###818 It was not intended to amuse you.
###821 But it does. It intrigues me too.
###824 It will let me put my aging colleagues on their mettle. Wonderful.
###829 Since you'll enjoy it, perhaps you'd give me a bargain price?
###833 There's one matter upon which my board never compromise, on finance.
###837 Without self-flattery, you'll never afford me.
###840 Name your price.
###842 Well, I'm not my father, of course,
###844 but in all due honesty I couldn't put myself in at a penny less than...
###848 ...20,000 pounds.
###850 - What a pity. - I accept.
###854 - You do? - You will no doubt wish to count it.
###857 But you will find each bundle contains a thousand pounds.
###863 I trust your board will be quite satisfied.
###868 - Good evening, gentlemen. - Good evening.
###870 - Popescu, good job in Zagreb. - Thank you.
###872 Gentlemen.
###874 General von Pinck. Military life certainly keeps you fit, sir.
###878 Lucoville, welcome to London. You too, my dear Weiss.
###882 Cesare, you're putting on weight.
###885 Food is the greatest pleasure in my life.
###887 Greatest? They tell me your wife is the most beautiful woman in Venice.
###891 She is also the best cook.
###893 And now, gentlemen, to business, please.
###922 It is fortunate that you're all in London for this meeting.
###925 Something has come up which has... How shall I put it?
###929 Crystallized thoughts I've had for some time past.
###932 Look at the great deeds recorded on these walls, gentlemen,
###935 each one performed in the course of bettering the world,
###939 purging it of evil, striking down tyranny.
###942 In those days, you were all ruled by my father's principle that our bureau
###946 would never kill anyone without a sound moral reason for doing so.
###950 He was a saintly man.
###954 Do you still adhere to his principles?
###957 Consider a moment. Be honest. Haven't we, in the pursuit of profit,
###960 fallen short of the high morals upon which our bureau was founded?
###964 It's always possible to find a good moral reason for killing anybody.
###967 Everybody, from some point of view, deserves death.
###971 Man is born to die.
###972 No operation that consistently shows a profit
###976 can do so without answering a legitimate demand.
###980 You say that we are justified by the prosperity
###983 our operations have brought us all.
###985 You, Lucoville, with your string of hotels.
###987 You, general, with your estates and castles.
###990 You, Weiss, with your Swiss banking syndicates,
###993 and you Spado, with your fake antiques. And you...
###1000 Oh, dear, we seem to have started our meeting without our vice chairman.
###1003 Does anybody know?
###1010 Lord Bostwick, my apologies. We started without you.
###1012 Forgive me. A fallen horse in Piccadilly caused a terrible congestion.
###1016 How the traffic will flow when it is all motorized.
###1019 Please, proceed, Mr. Chairman.
###1022 Thank you, my lord. I wish to put a commission before you.
###1025 It is an assignment I welcome and have accepted on your behalf.
###1028 To the commission of Miss Sonya Winter for 20,000 pounds,
###1031 the assassination of lvan Dragomiloff, your chairman.
###1044 Miss Winter has put into my hands the very weapon I need.
###1047 With all respect, I no longer see in you the idealism
###1050 without which we are no more than murderers.
###1052 Murderers! We are assassins!
###1055 I aim to put you to the test. I believe Miss Winter has shown us
###1059 the way to rekindle the torch we once held so high.
###1063 We won't stand for it.
###1068 It's really quite simple.
###1070 Under our constitution we have the right
###1072 to accept commissions on behalf of all. I have accepted this one.
###1076 But what does it mean?
###1078 It means, my friends, that you must kill me,
###1083 or I will kill you.
###1088 Kill us?
###1095 Yes, gentlemen, kill you.
###1097 Not to put too fine a point on it, I consider you all expendable.
###1100 Taking the honorable course, I challenge you to this duel.
###1103 Yes, but supposing, my dear young friend, that we succeed in killing you?
###1107 Then you, Lord Bostwick, whom I appoint as neutral referee
###1110 in this game, will, as vice chairman, take over my position,
###1114 pending the election of my successor.
###1116 I repeat, gentlemen. The commission has been accepted.
###1124 We must now settle a moment to begin this little adventure.
###1127 We must give you time to return home.
###1129 Some of your journeys will be longer than others.
###1131 Let us say that 24 hours from now we shall be considered at hazard.
###1135 Lord Bostwick, we'd better synchronize our watches.
###1139 7:30.
###1143 Gentlemen, 24 hours from the striking of this gavel, we shall be at hazard.
###1148 From tomorrow then, at precisely 7:30 p.m.
###1173 Hardly the act of a gentleman.
###1175 But one should always applaud initiative.
###1183 Good night to you, gentlemen, and good luck.
###1188 We must go after him. This ridiculous nonsense must be stopped.
###1192 The motion has been accepted. Discipline must be observed.
###1194 Why should we accept it? We've given our lives for the Bureau.
###1198 - Not yet. - Gentlemen,
###1201 it's not a moneymaking proposition.
###1205 As acting chairman, I call you to order.
###1208 Gentlemen, we have all been very loyal to the memory of our dear founder,
###1212 but let us be honest with ourselves.
###1215 I think we have all felt that seniority should have counted for something
###1219 when the succession was decided.
###1220 He should not have come in at the top.
###1223 - His father trained the boy well. - Of course.
###1226 Please do not misunderstand me, gentlemen.
###1228 I'm merely suggesting that it is in everybody's interest
###1231 to go along with our young chairman's sporting proposition.
###1235 In fact, I feel it is my duty as referee to stimulate your enthusiasm.
###1240 In addition to Miss Winter's fee, I offer a prize of 10,000 pounds
###1244 to whichever member accomplishes her commission.
###1247 A very sporting gesture, my lord.
###1250 No, no, no, no.
###1253 Our young chairman deserves all the credit.
###1256 He conceived this great adventure. He is certainly a sportsman.
###1276 Isn't he handsome.
###1280 Really.
###1284 Good morning.
###1289 Shall we take a little walk in the park, Miss Winter?
###1296 Mr. Dragomiloff.
###1298 Oh, forgive the disguise. Thanks to you, I'm a marked man.
###1302 My bureau accepted your commission.
###1305 Well, really.
###1307 The Albert Memorial?
###1310 It was an agreed rendezvous.
###1312 It was glorious in the park this morning.
###1315 - Well, when are you leaving? - Leaving?
###1318 Miss Winter, have you forgotten so soon that you're a journalist?
###1323 - What more can I do? - Follow Dragomiloff.
###1325 Report on his execution.
###1327 It's the greatest story of the decade, and covered by a woman.
###1331 - Isn't that what you wanted? - Of course.
###1334 My secretary will take care of everything. Money, tickets...
###1339 But I suppose you don't know where he'll go.
###1341 Well, he did tell me quite a lot about the Bureau,
###1344 where it operates and everything.
###1347 - We walked by the Serpentine. - Miss Winter,
###1350 you do want to go on with the story?
###1352 I've invested a lot of money in it.
###1354 Oh, most certainly. I shall have the greatest pleasure in reporting his...
###1359 - Whatever happens to him. - Splendid.
###1361 Now, remember, you are to wire me personally about all his movements.
###1366 Now, to where shall we buy you a ticket?
###1370 To Paris.
###1377 Shocking.
###1383 Disgusting.
###1388 It's disgraceful. It's a scandal.
###1392 Oh! It's an outrage. What has happened to my Paris?
###1396 It has become a sink of iniquity. A sewer. A den of vice.
###1401 - The tourists expect it, my dear. - Oh, nonsense!
###1404 The whole civilized world is shocked by it.
###1407 Nobody knows that better than you, Henri. Oh, yes, my dear.
###1411 You are one of the few senators of the republic
###1414 who have dared to stand out against evil.
###1417 I suppose it was my duty.
###1419 Oh, I respect you for it. Though sometimes I must confess,
###1422 - I fear for you. - Fear for me?
###1425 To oppose this underworld of vice may endanger your very life.
###1429 Well, it was your idea.
###1432 Somebody had to speak out. As I've always said,
###1435 if you want something done, do it yourself.
###1437 Well, my dear, I must be off to the senate.
###1440 We've a sitting that may go on most of the night.
###1443 The women of France will never forget what you're doing for them, Henri.
###1446 I hope not. Good night.
###1461 - Anything to report? - There's not a sign of him.
###1464 Everyone has been shown his photo.
###1465 Watch carefully. He's a devil.
###1490 - Good evening, Monsieur Lucoville. - Good evening.
###1492 - How is business? - Up a little on last week.
###1495 And how is the new cheap champagne going?
###1497 We serve it after midnight, same price, and nobody notices.
###1501 Excellent. You have been warned to look out for a certain man.
###1505 I have his picture here.
###1507 - He will not pass. - Excellent.
###1526 I am informed that one may find here
###1528 the most suitable arrangements for the night.
###1534 Monsieur le Comte de... Certainly, Your Excellency.
###1537 We shall arrange for you something special.
###1542 Good evening.
###1546 Just one moment.
###1559 My dear count, it's a pleasure to welcome you to our house.
###1561 - Well, madame, I am incognito. - But of course.
###1564 You will be one of our best-known unknown visitors. This way.
###1568 Phillippe, champagne in the Swan Room at once.
###1580 Absolutely hopeless. This one has knock-knees
###1584 and this one has the most frightful hangdog look about her.
###1588 And as for this one,
###1590 I seem to remember her at least five years ago in le Sphinx.
###1595 I demand something different, something fresh.
###1599 But Your Excellency has seen the most beautiful girls in the house!
###1602 Damn it! Damn it! I demand to see the director.
###1605 But he does not concern himself with the customers, Excellency.
###1609 He will concern himself with me, madame.
###1611 You tell Monsieur Lucoville to come here now!
###1614 And get these creatures out of here!
###1616 Of course, Excellency. Spank to your pleasure, Your Excellency, Your Honor.
###1620 Oh! Allez, vite!
###1623 Good evening. I was recommended to you by Lord Bostwick.
###1626 Lord Bostwick? Yes, he's a very old customer.
###1629 He knows we like to cater for the English taste.
###1632 Nothing I can do will please the gentleman.
###1635 Nothing you can do. I don't wonder. Let someone else try.
###1644 Surely this is a place of assignation?
###1647 It is certainly not a convent. Just stay here. I'll tell madame.
###1651 How very interesting.
###1655 I must make some notes.
###1656 The count wants something different.
###1658 - Excuse me. There is a new girl. - No, not now.
###1668 That's the most exciting creature in the place!
###1672 But she looks completely innocent.
###1674 Yes, exactly.
###1680 - I am the patron, mademoiselle. - How do you do?
###1682 Come this way, please.
###1684 I wonder if I might ask you one or two questions.
###1687 Don't worry, cherie, he doesn't want anyone experienced.
###1699 Entrez.
###1705 Your Excellency, it is an honor to meet you.
###1708 I have found you something entirely fresh.
###1711 What delightful surprises you have up your sleeve, patron.
###1715 In there. In there.
###1719 For the exceptional customer, there is always something...
###1724 How shall I say... special.
###1729 Special, yes. The room is to your satisfaction, Excellency?
###1733 They have sent you champagne. It's on the house, of course.
###1736 Oui, oui, oui, oui.
###1738 Where is that girl?
###1740 Where are you?
###1742 Tell me. Are all the rooms decorated in this fashion?
###1746 What are you doing, girl? The count doesn't want to be kept waiting.
###1749 Get your clothes off.
###1765 Dear, dear chairman, is this fair?
###1769 - I am unarmed. - Of course.
###1771 You see, you're slack as well as degenerate.
###1774 I really must apologize...
###1776 It's you.
###1780 Pierre. Gaston. In there.
###1784 What's a girl like you doing here?
###1786 - I thought it was a hotel. - Break down the door.
###1789 - Let's get out of the window. - You stay here.
###1791 You can't leave me in a place like this.
###1793 - Your bed, Miss Winter. You lie on it. - Shoot off the lock.
###1799 All right. Come on.
###1803 Let's cut through here.
###1806 No, perhaps not.
###1813 It's a raid. It's a raid. It's a raid.
###1817 My God, it's a raid! A raid, patron.
###1818 - Don't panic, gentlemen! - What's the meaning of this intrusion?
###1822 A madman has seized one of my girls against her will.
###1824 - Impossible. - Carry on, gentlemen!
###1827 The emergency will soon be over.
###1828 Jacques, champagne on the house for our guests!
###1836 Search the whole place!
###1841 Oh, Mallon, my dear fellow, how nice to see you. Au revoir.
###1850 We must go in somewhere.
###1855 I begin to suspect you're protecting my virtue.
###1857 I'm afraid it will have to look after itself.
###1861 You're too beautiful, cherie. I dare not look at you.
###1865 No! No! I can wait no longer!
###1878 Quick! The stairs.
###1886 No! Don't shoot the customers!
###1923 In there, patron.
###1925 Now we have him trapped. Shoot the lock.
###1927 It's no use, patron. He's bolted the door.
###1937 Very well. We'll smoke him out.
###1943 - You've got us into a pretty pickle. - I have?
###1946 - You're not here at my invitation. - Well, how do we get out?
###1950 All problems are capable of solution.
###1958 Keep your guns ready.
###1964 Gas.
###1972 A laundry chute. I told you there's always a solution.
###1975 - It is exceedingly small. - Fortunately, I am not too fat,
###1979 and you are positively skinny.
###1980 - Skinny. - Come along.
###1984 We've got a little while. Get on the floor, please.
###1986 - I beg your pardon! - Gas.
###1989 It's lighter than air. It fills the room from the ceiling...
###1992 ...downwards.
###1994 - It won't take long. - Long enough.
###1996 This commodious bag of yours
###1998 wouldn't by any chance contain such a thing as a first-aid kit, would it?
###2011 Do not arrest anyone wearing the Legion d'Honneur!
###2014 Surely you do not wish to harm that innocent young lady.
###2017 Come out and face the music.
###2023 When they burst the door open, they'll strike these matches alight.
###2026 The room will become a bomb.
###2032 - Now, Miss Winter, - Yes.
###2034 I thought I told you to keep close to the floor!
###2039 - Yes, I will... - Miss Winter?
###2043 Inspector, we have nothing to hide.
###2045 I assure you that this is a perfectly respectable hotel.
###2051 En avant!
###2079 Now, open the door, lvan.
###2084 We might even make a bargain.
###2086 If I was to become vice chairman...
###2093 He's drawing the bolts!
###2095 I knew you'd see reason, lvan.
###2098 I can't manage the lock.
###2103 It's the gas! The gas!
###2108 We'll have to break in.
###2109 Quick, quick! Break open the door!
###2129 No, no, no! Out of the way!
###2133 I always say, if you want something done, you've got to do it yourself.
###2137 Stand back! Champagne on the house!
###2166 Come on, you. No use hiding in here.
###2168 Been at the bottle?
###2170 Put her in the wagon with the others.
###2193 Let me go, please! Let me go!
###2197 I am a British citizen!
###2201 I demand to see the British ambassador!
###2226 - Good morning. - Good God.
###2229 May I come in? Thanks to those ridiculous policemen,
###2232 I nearly missed the train.
###2233 I thought I'd given you the slip.
###2235 Thank you, it was most considerate.
###2237 There was a first-class ticket to Zurich in the pocket.
###2241 An oversight.
###2243 Miss Winter, our rules do not allow our clients to supervise
###2246 the execution of their commissions.
###2248 Oh, I'm not doing that.
###2250 I'm just covering the story in the course of my profession.
###2253 Our records didn't show you were a journalist.
###2256 Well, this is my first assignment.
###2258 Which newspaper are you writing for?
###2261 For the Daily...
###2263 For the Daily Press, at large.
###2266 Women are not yet accepted in journalism.
###2268 But when I have this story, anyone will employ me.
###2271 It will strike a great blow for women.
###2273 Well, Miss Winter...
###2276 ...if anybody is to write the story of this epic adventure,
###2280 - it is only right that it should be you. - Thank you.
###2283 And since you're to be my constant shadow, I suppose I'd better feed you.
###2286 Shall we adjourn to the dining car for luncheon?
###2300 But how can I accept your point of view?
###2302 To take life is the ultimate wrong.
###2304 - It's basic to all civilized ethics. - Really.
###2307 You accept the gallows, guillotine and the gas chamber.
###2310 And not to mention the field of battle.
###2314 - Brandy? - No, thank you. I never touch spirits.
###2317 Pity. Taken in moderation, it can greatly clarify the mind.
###2321 Thank you. My mind is perfectly clear on one topic concerning us:
###2324 All killing is wrong.
###2326 - And yet you commissioned mine. - That was quite different.
###2329 You don't go into a butcher to buy a steak
###2331 and question his morality in killing the cow.
###2334 Really, you're impossible. I shall return to my carriage.
###2337 - Shall I accompany you? - No, thank you.
###2340 I'm sure you are the one in need of the brandy.
###2351 - Cognac, monsieur? - Please.
###2353 Thank you.
###2355 - Excellent, an '88. - Anything further, sir?
###2359 - Just a cigar, thank you. - A cigar.
###2368 That'll be all, thank you.
###2369 Not quite all, lvan.
###2376 Popescu?
###2383 What a marvelous makeup.
###2385 You know, these new Leichner waxes are fantastic!
###2387 Thank you, lvan. And now there is much sadness in the world,
###2392 and there must be a little more.
###2395 Won't you at least permit me to finish my brandy and cigar?
###2398 The drink certainly, the cigar will take too long.
###2401 The kitchen staff won't stay locked in the galley forever.
###2405 While you were enjoying yourself in Paris, lvan,
###2409 I was preparing this operation.
###2411 You will admit it has the merit of surprise.
###2434 What's this?
###2436 "Popescu... Romanian businessman...
###2440 "...falls from Paris-Zurich express..." Et cetera...
###2446 "...burns on body"?
###2448 What did that young devil do to him?
###2450 The toast is absent friends.
###2453 Lucoville was a fool.
###2455 Any business with women is bad business.
###2458 But Popescu will be a great loss.
###2461 Does your agent report where our chairman is now?
###2464 Not yet. But she is a very able young woman,
###2466 and I'm sure that we shall hear something quite soon.
###2472 That idiot in Liechtenstein!
###2475 His talent lay in company fraud.
###2477 Certainly not in handling explosives.
###2482 Things are not going well, Muntzov.
###2485 I want this matter finished quickly.
###2487 Political tension is growing in Europe. The Bureau is the instrument I need.
###2492 Weiss understands the value of money.
###2494 I'm sure we can rely on Swiss efficiency in Zurich.
###2500 Suspect everyone!
###2503 Do you understand? Everyone.
###2506 The man is a master of disguises. Better to be safe than sorry.
###2514 - If we spot him, what do we do? - I told you.
###2517 Ring the bell to my office. But on no account
###2521 wink an eyelid even. Otherwise, you are a dead man.
###2531 Right. Go to your places, everyone!
###2536 Open the doors!
###2576 Is this where they keep the money?
###2578 Well, yes, mein Herr.
###2581 What? What did you require?
###2584 The mountains are full of thieves. Nothing is safe.
###2589 Bad luck, lvan! You don't fool me with this, my boy.
###2594 In Switzerland we are efficient, yes?
###2596 What are you doing? My box! Take care of my box!
###2601 The box.
###2603 Of course. The box.
###2606 - Throw it out into the street. - What?
###2609 Throw it out before it goes off.
###2611 The game is up, lvan.
###2614 Come back! Come back! My box! My savings!
###2618 Stop it, lvan.
###2619 The game is up.
###2625 Das geht zu weit.
###2637 I never know if I can trust you.
###2640 Dear, you know I might be recognized anywhere.
###2642 Simply hand it in for the attention of the director.
###2645 - That's all. - Very well.
###2654 - You're a villain. - I beg you...
###2656 Thief! Give me my money.
###2659 They told me you would look after my money.
###2662 What do you do? You throw it in the gutter!
###2664 I want my money! Give it to me!
###2668 Excuse me.
###2674 - Yes, mademoiselle. - I have something for the director.
###2681 What? What is it?
###2683 Well, she has something for the director.
###2693 Half-wit. Idiot!
###2697 My apologies, mademoiselle.
###2700 Take it, man. Put it in my office!
###2706 A terrible misunderstanding, mein Herr.
###2711 Get away!
###2717 What are you all standing here for? Get back to work!
###2720 All of you! Get back to work.
###2729 What exactly was in that case?
###2732 Purely technical details. They belong to our research department.
###2736 We have some very brilliant scientists working for us.
###2739 When they make a discovery, they deposit their secrets in a safe place.
###2752 I think they'll be pleased with the result.
###2790 There is no one in the army to match you, Herr General.
###2793 - Congratulations, Herr General. - Congratulate him.
###2796 It is not a disgrace to be beaten by the ex-champion of Germany.
###2800 You will bear the scars of your general's saber.
###2803 Carry them with honor, lieutenant.
###2807 What is the army coming to?
###2810 - Take him away and stitch him up! - A visitor, Herr General.
###2814 Lord Bostwick.
###2815 General, I'm glad you're keeping your hand in.
###2818 I'm just from Essen. Alfred Krupp sends his regards.
###2820 - Can we talk privately? - Leave us.
###2823 - You've heard the news from Zurich? - So much for the efficient Swiss.
###2828 Ja, ja. Always one must be alert. And to be alert, you must be fit.
###2833 En garde!
###2838 Absent friends.
###2839 For heaven's sake, stop it, Muntzov!
###2842 I've a good mind to send you back to Petrograd.
###2845 No, no, we don't want to risk any more of us.
###2848 Well, this fooling has got to stop.
###2850 What good is the Bureau with its best members gone?
###2852 The cream still remains.
###2854 Prove it, general, in Vienna.
###2857 Our young chairman is on his way there now.
###2859 - We have no one in Vienna. - Send someone.
###2864 It will be arranged.
###2867 To poor lvan.
###2872 Drunken idiot. Young Dragomiloff is worth ten of you.
###2878 What a tragedy that he lacks the vision to go along with me.
###2882 His whole romantic notion on moral killing is out-of-date.
###2886 If only he could realize that our organization
###2889 is the most lethal instrument of power ever conceived.
###2893 The Assassination Bureau is a political weapon or it is nothing.
###2897 Properly used, as I can use it,
###2899 it could bring down governments, dynasties and empires.
###2904 I could rule the destiny of Europe.
###2908 Great things are afoot.
###2912 Sell everything you possess, my friends, and buy shares in armaments.
###2916 Krupp, Skoda, Vickers-Armstrong. Take your pick.
###2920 Europe is already in ferment!
###2982 - Good morning, Miss Winter. - Good morning.
###2984 - You evidently sleep well in Vienna. - A luxury I appreciate.
###2988 Our bureau hasn't a branch here. A day off is a pleasant prospect.
###2991 Are you impressed with the emperor's forces? Thank you.
###2995 How ridiculous men are. All this dressing up and rattling of sabers.
###2999 Who's that barbarous gentleman taking the salute?
###3002 Prince Ferdinand of Ruthenia. He's Austria's Balkan puppet.
###3006 He's here in Vienna to be impressed by his master's military might.
###3010 When will we learn that force is meaningless?
###3014 Never. After all, you're paying to have me killed
###3017 because you believe that you are right and I am wrong.
###3021 It's nothing personal. It's just that...
###3030 Oh, my God!
###3036 Die, Ruthenian dogs, long live Carpathia!
###3041 Long live Carpathia!
###3050 Thank you, Miss Winter.
###3052 - I... I thought... - That the bullet was meant for me.
###3055 Sadly, I have no monopoly in the assassination business.
###3058 - Now, I insist you have a brandy. - No, thank you, I...
###3061 Your mind needs clarifying. You're paying to have me killed,
###3064 yet when you think I might be, you try to save me.
###3067 A revelation comparable with Saint Paul's at Tarsus.
###3070 Surely that calls for a celebration.
###3112 I'm quite out of breath.
###3114 - You're a very good dancer. - Of course.
###3117 My father liked me to excel... in everything.
###3121 Your father. You know something, I don't think you've really grown up.
###3124 - I was born old. - Well, maybe that's the trouble.
###3128 Now, while we're in Vienna, there's a certain Professor Freud...
###3132 Don't mention that name.
###3133 To meddle with my basic instincts would be professional suicide.
###3137 That's what I had in mind.
###3151 - I like it here. - Good.
###3154 You wait till you taste the Blutwurst. Where's that waiter got to?
###3168 Get me his apron. Put the bomb inside the sausage.
###3173 Quickly, man, and be careful. Mind the knife!
###3175 The slightest touch of metal will set it off.
###3182 Drink to the days The days going by
###3186 Some day we'll meet again
###3189 Remember me till then
###3193 While we're young While we're young
###3195 There are songs to be sung
###3197 And a pledge that's warm and gay
###3201 "I promise to Remember you
###3205 "The way you are today"
###3208 While we're young While we're young
###3211 There are songs to be sung
###3213 And a pledge that's warm and gay
###3217 Excellencies.
###3219 The Archduke Ferdinand of Ruthenia has decided to visit this establishment.
###3223 It is an honor, Excellency.
###3224 His Highness wants some relaxation.
###3226 We were against it, after this morning's incident.
###3229 You must see that everything is in order.
###3231 Of course. This is a most respectable establishment.
###3234 I hope not. I told you, he wanted some relaxation.
###3249 Now, leave it to me and get out!
###3256 Lift up your glass on high
###3260 Drink to the days The days going by
###3265 Some day we'll meet again
###3268 Remember me till then
###3272 While we're young While we're young
###3274 There are songs to be sung
###3275 And a pledge that's warm and gay
###3279 "I promise to Remember you
###3283 "The way you are today"
###3286 While we're young While we're young
###3288 There are songs to be sung
###3290 And a pledge that's warm and gay
###3294 "I promise to Remember you
###3297 "The way you are today"
###3300 - The Blutwurst. - Here we are, mein Herr,
###3302 the riesen Blutwurst, the greatest delicacy in all Vienna.
###3307 The pigs for the Blutwurst are bred here in our Vienna woods.
###3312 They were slaughtered only this morning.
###3316 The blood must be quite fresh. Yes, yes.
###3320 In Vienna we have the best of everything.
###3323 Enjoy yourselves.
###3324 And drink it down, down Down, down, down
###3329 Down, down, down Down, down
###3334 Lift up your glass on high
###3338 Drink to the days The days gone by
###3340 Waiter!
###3342 Some day we'll meet again
###3344 Remember me till then
###3348 Lift up your glass on high
###3352 A sausage! But what did I say? This is indeed a place of fun!
###3356 Excellency, apologies. Allow me.
###3358 No, no, no. Put it on the table.
###3360 The Blutwurst is my favorite dish.
###3364 Bring me a knife.
###3365 - Come on! - But why? Why are we going?
###3370 You're acting completely like a lunatic! It was just warming up in there.
###3375 Evidently.
###3383 - That poor man. - Archduke Ferdie?
###3386 Waste no tears on him. A petty tyrant, if ever there was one.
###3390 An historic event. You should make an excellent journalist.
###3393 You're always on the spot.
###3396 - But that bomb was meant for you. - Precisely.
###3399 I thought you said the Bureau had no one here in Vienna.
###3402 They sent someone.
###3404 I wonder how they knew I was here.
###3411 Perhaps you've been followed.
###3414 - Indeed. I have, my dear. By you. - Me?
###3418 At Lord Bostwick's command, no doubt.
###3421 How did you know? He said not to say...
###3423 He also didn't tell you he's vice chairman of our bureau.
###3426 Lord Bostwick?
###3429 - I can't believe it. - A man of many parts.
###3432 - He's a villain. - Well, he'll hear no more from you.
###3436 On the contrary. I intend to keep him fully informed.
###3440 You what?
###3441 I want to know exactly why he wants control of the Bureau.
###3445 I shall wire him at once you're on your way to Venice.
###3450 Can't you make any more of it than this?
###3452 - There's nothing but facts! - We mustn't inflame the situation.
###3455 Ruthenia and Carpathia are puppets! Russia and Austria pull the strings.
###3460 So punch in some big headlines:
###3462 "Russia Warns Austria"! "Austria Warns Russia"!
###3466 "The Kaiser Summons his General Staff"!
###3468 You have private sources of information?
###3470 Of course. So get on with it, man.
###3472 We're running a newspaper. Give them news!
###3476 This is a stroke of luck, Muntzov.
###3479 Ferdinand's death is the spark I needed. Cheer up.
###3482 To a Russian, death is a serious matter.
###3485 - Life is no joke, either. - But time is running out.
###3488 I've got my new members picked.
###3491 But I need the Bureau in my hands now.
###3494 We must make sure once and for all in Venice.
###3498 Thank heaven for Cesare Spado. He has all the skill of the Borgias.
###3503 All my friends in London tell me I'm getting a little fat.
###3507 I can't resist.
###3513 My dearest one! You haven't put vanilla in the zabaglione!
###3517 You know how I dislike it!
###3521 Nonsense, Cesare. Just peel of tangerine.
###3525 I prepared it myself. There's not a drop of vanilla in it.
###3529 I can taste it distinctly.
###3531 There is positively no vanilla in the zabaglione.
###3534 Taste it again.
###3539 Perhaps you're right.
###3540 Eat it up now or I shall be very offended.
###3544 I will not speak to you.
###3546 Or let you...
###3550 No, no, no. Eleanora, my angel...
###3554 It's delicious.
###3557 I tell everyone your cooking is supreme.
###3559 The taste has quite disappeared.
###3562 You've outdone yourself, my darling.
###3568 Eleanora, my dear, it's just possible that a man
###3571 with whom I have business connections may call here.
###3574 - I would prefer not to see him. - As you wish.
###3577 His name is Dragomiloff, but he may not declare himself.
###3581 I would like you to describe carefully anyone who may call.
###3584 What a dreadful fuss.
###3597 This is our finest view,
###3599 the room Signor Dragomiloff always prefers, signora.
###3602 You will see the sun rise up behind the Santa Maria della Salute.
###3606 - A sight never to be forgotten. - A little misunderstanding.
###3609 I am not a signora and therefore require a separate room.
###3612 Scusi, signorina. What a pity.
###3614 I hope you have another equally delightful room.
###3617 The room, yes, signor. The view, no.
###3619 - I have only a room at the back. - Then she must have this room.
###3623 - Oh, no. - No, I insist.
###3624 Take my luggage to whatever room. I'll see you later.
###3627 It is a very delightful room, signor. You will be most comfortable.
###3631 I'm sure I will. Thank you very much indeed.
###3635 Well, it seems we have a married look.
###3638 Because you're after my blood, no doubt.
###3640 Don't talk nonsense. We've got no time to waste.
###3645 - What are you doing? - Can't be too careful.
###3648 My dear friend Spado might have left me a welcoming present.
###3654 That's all clear. Bombs aren't the Italian line.
###3657 They prefer more subtle methods.
###3661 Well, the sooner you talk to him the better. Isn't it time you left?
###3665 Miss Winter.
###3669 Since our relationship became less formal,
###3671 I observe a tendency on your part to nag.
###3674 - Sometimes you can be very irritating. - I have been told that.
###3679 Stay here until I return, understand? Absolutely no one is allowed in.
###3682 If you sleep, lock the windows. The balcony's an easy climb.
###3686 To be on the safe side, I will lock you in and keep the key.
###3689 But this is absurd. If Spado is so dangerous,
###3692 how can you hope to win him over to our plan?
###3694 Cesare and my father were very close.
###3697 I doubt he'd go the way of the others
###3699 had it not been for such a demanding wife.
###3701 - As usual, the woman gets the blame. - Not without good cause, I gather.
###3705 I'm told that Signora Spado has considerable charms
###3708 and doesn't hesitate to use them.
###3713 She hasn't your high principles.
###3715 Your self-denial is really quite remarkable.
###3718 A woman's beauty can be a lethal weapon.
###3724 - My God. - My darling, what can it be?
###3727 Is it something you have eaten?
###3730 It's working.
###3732 The poison, it's doing its work.
###3739 Poison?
###3741 What are you saying, Cesare?
###3744 How could he have managed it?
###3747 He? Who are you talking of, my darling?
###3751 The son of my old friend and comrade.
###3753 I had arranged his death, but he has got me first.
###3756 - Cesare, you're delirious. - There is so much I must tell you.
###3760 Lie still. Angelo has gone for a doctor.
###3769 You must hear it all.
###3771 This business I am in with this man Dragomiloff,
###3774 it is called...
###3780 ...the Assassination Bureau.
###3788 This Englishman lord will pay 10,000 pounds
###3792 for this man Dragomiloff's death?
###3794 Pieces of silver. Pieces of silver.
###3799 Many pieces.
###3801 Can you forgive me?
###3804 It was for you that I did these dreadful things.
###3809 But you are so tender, so innocent.
###3814 What can you know of assassination?
###3842 Life flows along
###3850 Just like a boat on a river
###3859 All that I want is to
###3865 Find a place
###3869 Safe in the harbor
###3875 Of love's embrace
###3880 Good evening.
###3882 - Forgive my entering unannounced. - Who are you?
###3885 - A friend of your husband. - My husband is away.
###3888 Strange.
###3891 He knew I was coming.
###3893 We had some business to do together.
###3896 You... You haven't told me your name.
###3900 My name is...
###3903 ...lvan Dragomiloff.
###3909 Signor Dragomiloff.
###3912 I've heard him talk so often about you.
###3916 I feel we are old friends.
###3919 Me too.
###3921 I have heard much about you. Cesare is a... A lucky man.
###3926 May I ask you where he has gone?
###3930 I don't know.
###3931 He's just, well, floating around.
###3934 Since you are alone, my presence might compromise you.
###3937 - Perhaps I should go. - No, no. We'll have a glass of wine.
###3941 - Do sit down. - Thank you.
###3945 How much do you know about his business?
###3949 Oh, nothing.
###3951 Well, then, you'll hardly be able to make up for his absence, will you?
###3956 I wouldn't say that.
###3966 Will you think me very wicked
###3968 if I confess to being pleased that Cesare is away?
###3972 I would think you very flattering.
###3974 But that's not the reason why you made away with him.
###3977 I what?!
###3979 I'm sorry. I didn't mean to startle you.
###3981 How dare you accuse me of such a thing!
###3984 Let's not have melodramatics.
###3985 I saw your handsome gondolier dispose of the body.
###3988 Now please sit down.
###3990 Perhaps we can come to some arrangement.
###3993 One moment. Angelo, I must deal with him.
###4002 - You have a man in. - Not for long.
###4004 - Long, short, what is the difference? - Don't be a fool.
###4007 He knows. He saw you. He could destroy us.
###4010 - Then I will fix him. - I will.
###4012 My way.
###4015 Go and prepare the gondola, then wait.
###4018 I will ring when it is done. It will be quick this time.
###4026 You can't prove your ridiculous accusation.
###4029 I hope I won't have to.
###4030 We have plenty of time to talk it over.
###4032 Then let's have another glass of wine.
###4036 Please, close the window. The night has grown chilly.
###4040 Even if what you say was true,
###4042 wouldn't I have been merely doing your job for you?
###4049 You said you knew nothing of your husband's business.
###4052 Perhaps it is now my business.
###4063 I'm sure that you'll handle it very capably.
###4066 Thank you.
###4071 Please draw the curtains.
###4080 It appears we understand each other well.
###4082 - Sit down, please. - Thank you.
###4085 I told you I could take my husband's place.
###4088 What a delightful little table, like a wheel of fortune.
###4093 Our fortunes, it seems,
###4095 are to be linked.
###4096 - Shall we drink to that? - I...
###4099 - I can't drink to the unknown. - You're not adventurous.
###4103 I drink to it.
###4129 Bellissima.
###4133 Get rid of him.
###4135 What a pity.
###4137 He was so young.
###4140 All that I want is to
###4145 Find a place
###4149 Safe in the harbor
###4154 Of love's embrace
###4158 How sweet...
###4358 Fortunately, I kept wicket for Eton.
###4360 - Oh, don't worry, I've turned it off. - It...
###4364 It was on the canopy.
###4366 Splendid. I knew these new time bombs would come in useful.
###4370 Can't you talk anything but shop? I've nearly been killed.
###4375 Oh, I'm sorry.
###4378 I am sorry.
###4383 I'll never forgive myself.
###4385 This room was meant for me. I should never have left you here.
###4392 What on earth are you doing in that ridiculous costume?
###4396 I forgot.
###4398 I regret to have to inform you that lvan Dragomiloff is now dead.
###4403 - What? - Yes, events took an unexpected turn.
###4406 However, the first part of our plot has been achieved.
###4409 - You mean they think you're dead? - Precisely.
###4412 I shall now have to disappear into hiding.
###4415 And the rest, Miss Winter, is up to you.
###4420 Now, that's what I call a really pretty dress.
###4439 Miss Winter.
###4450 Miss Winter, surrender.
###4460 Why not?
###4462 Surrender is no defeat...
###4464 ...for a woman.
###4479 My friend has not returned to the hotel. He's been out all night.
###4482 I'm desperately afraid he was run over.
###4485 - In Venice, signorina? - Well, fallen in a canal, anything.
###4489 - Please, you must help me. - Of course, signorina.
###4492 - The name of your friend? - Dragomiloff.
###4495 Ivan Dragomiloff.
###4497 One moment, signorina.
###4511 Signorina, I am sorry.
###4514 - I fear I have very bad news. - What?
###4518 - What is it? - Your friend.
###4520 There must have been an accident. He has been drowned.
###4523 His body has been taken from the canal.
###4532 - I'll be all right. - There were papers with his name.
###4535 But we would like you to identify the body, if you are able.
###4544 - Very well. - Please come this way, signorina.
###4572 It is...
###4575 ...he.
###4582 This way, signorina.
###4600 It... It... It is him.
###4604 - Yes, we found papers on the body. - Was Dragomiloff a good friend?
###4608 He was the best friend my husband had.
###4611 We were very close.
###4613 We will save you any more pain, signora.
###4616 I would be very glad if he could be brought to my palazzo.
###4620 It is not fitting that such a man should lie here.
###4625 Whatever the signora desires.
###4627 We salvaged the gondola, signora.
###4629 But alas, there is as yet no sign of the gondolier.
###4633 Poor Angelo.
###4684 Poor Angelo's clothes fit you perfectly.
###4688 A little tight, perhaps, because you are more muscular.
###4692 I prefer that.
###4694 Go to the undertakers.
###4696 I want this gruesome thing removed
###4698 as soon as my guests have paid their respects.
###4701 Well, come along, Piero. Get on with it.
###4706 I hope you're not going to take liberties.
###4723 Miss Winter?
###4728 Miss Winter, I hardly recognized you.
###4730 - My congratulations. - Lord Bostwick.
###4733 I came as soon as I received your telegram announcing his death.
###4736 May I introduce an associate of mine, Baron Muntzov.
###4739 Well, my dear young lady,
###4741 the press has once again shown itself to be the conscience of the nation.
###4745 Your story will be syndicated all over the world.
###4748 Come, we will go directly to Spado's house,
###4750 and pay our respects to the dead.
###4752 At Spado's house?
###4754 But his body is at the morgue.
###4755 As I so often find, my information is more up-to-date than my reporters'.
###4760 Signora Spado's had the coffin taken to her palazzo.
###4763 My lord. My lord.
###4766 I've just arrived from Berlin, the news is grave.
###4770 Dragomiloff has gone just in time.
###4775 Miss Winter, may I introduce General von Pinck.
###4778 Collect the luggage and bring Miss Winter.
###4780 The general and I will go on ahead. We have important matters to discuss.
###4788 There's mobilization. I must return tonight.
###4795 Will there be war?
###4797 Not yet, the kaiser's proposing a secret peace conference.
###4800 - Indeed. - He goes to Ruthenia for the funeral,
###4803 and that's where the conference will take place.
###4806 They will all be there: The English king. Tsar Nicholas.
###4810 The president of France. The Austrian emperor. The...
###4813 Spare me this catalog of mediocrity.
###4816 All this may suit me very well.
###4825 Signora Spado, my greetings and congratulations.
###4827 My colleague, General von Pinck.
###4830 My husband is away. I had to act on his behalf.
###4832 It's hard to believe a beautiful lady succeeds where many men failed.
###4837 We should invite you onto the board.
###4839 Thank you, Lord Bostwick. But I don't think it is suitable
###4842 for an Italian lady to practice murder professionally.
###4845 I will be content with the reward you have so kindly offered.
###4849 And you shall have it, dear lady.
###4852 So there he lies.
###4854 Poor lvan.
###4856 He was too young to see the potentialities of his inheritance.
###4859 Requiescat in pace.
###4861 Ivan killed by a woman, that's droll.
###4864 I believe Spado's house is quite beautiful.
###4867 As with so many things, first impressions are the worst.
###4871 This way, signorina.
###4874 And so you see, my dear signora,
###4876 this young lady has served her purpose and must be disposed of.
###4882 Miss Winter, Muntzov has been monopolizing you.
###4885 Signora Spado, this is Miss Winter,
###4887 whose commission you executed on behalf of your husband.
###4894 If you'll excuse me, I'll make a room ready for the discussion.
###4898 No, no, no. This will do splendidly.
###4900 The presence of our ex-chairman will be a spur to our deliberations.
###4904 You openly admit you are a member of the Bureau?
###4906 A member?
###4908 Thanks to you and Signora Spado, I am now the chairman.
###4911 What a journalist you would have made.
###4913 In at the death of the old Bureau and the birth of the new.
###4916 Unfortunately, you must also be its first victim.
###4927 Dispose of her, Muntzov. It's time you did something useful.
###4930 This way.
###4938 Take her below. There are steps to the canal.
###4941 Don't make any false moves. I'm a dangerous man.
###4957 Go to that wall, please, Miss Winter.
###4965 If you would please face the wall, my dear.
###4968 We Slavs are so temperamental.
###4970 Somehow, I don't feel like it at all today.
###4974 So you're a coward as well as a murderer.
###4977 I don't seem really to care for killing people anymore.
###4981 Keep quite still, Miss Winter.
###4984 It's best to make a clean job of it.
###5024 Ivan.
###5029 What on earth?
###5031 - I'm in mourning. - For your lost principles, I presume?
###5035 You look like you're got up to seduce an archbishop.
###5037 - Don't you like it? - Oh, I'm turning in my grave.
###5041 Will you at least get rid of that preposterous hat.
###5046 - How dare you! - That's better.
###5049 At any rate, you played your part admirably.
###5052 See what results the report of my death produced.
###5054 - It nearly produced mine. - It's brought them here,
###5058 as I knew it would.
###5059 Now we see whether I can learn more dead than alive.
###5062 But the coffin in the room upstairs, who's in it?
###5065 The man you identified as me, of course, her gondolier.
###5068 - Muntzov! - Come on.
###5070 Muntzov, where are you?
###5072 - Where could that idiot go? - He'd be here.
###5074 The secret stairs from my apartments lead down to that landing.
###5078 A girl, even Muntzov couldn't fail.
###5081 He evidently did.
###5084 And the girl's hat.
###5086 - If he killed her, then... - Then who killed him?
###5093 - I want to see inside that coffin. - Oh, no.
###5097 - And why not, signora? - You're not squeamish, surely?
###5111 Take off the lid.
###5113 - Please, don't disturb the dead. - Be silent.
###5134 Replace the lid.
###5141 My apologies, signora. You've done your job well.
###5144 Don't worry, signora. He can't get away.
###5150 General, I will return to Germany. Where will your headquarters be?
###5154 At my hunting lodge at Rothenburg.
###5157 The peace conference will take place across the frontier in the Castle Minsk.
###5162 Convenient. I'll summon the Bureau members to meet us at Rothenburg.
###5166 - But my staff will be there, officers. - Of course, and they'll be very useful.
###5171 So goodbye, lvan.
###5173 You're going to miss our greatest assignment of all.
###5177 At my commission, the assassination of Europe.
###5184 They have come to take him away.
###5189 Make sure the screws are tight.
###5275 We'll have a glass of wine, and then we can complete our business.
###5279 Of course, the reward.
###5281 I suppose it was rather tactless of Cesare
###5284 to tell me so much about your secret business.
###5287 Who can quarrel with such an excellent result?
###5290 Surely it is worth more than a mere 10,000 pounds?
###5293 Of course. How much would you suggest?
###5295 Naturally, you would not like your affairs made public.
###5299 Shall we say 100,000?
###5302 Oh, alas, signora, we are not a rich organization.
###5305 But you have such great plans now that I have given you control.
###5309 Surely that is worth special consideration?
###5312 Indeed.
###5314 Von Pinck, see that signora gets the most special consideration we offer.
###5349 Well done, Miss Winter. On the spot as usual.
###5363 As Europe's heads of state travel to Ruthenia for the funeral of its ruler,
###5368 the Archduke Ferdinand's tragic death threatens to set Europe ablaze.
###5373 Throughout Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire,
###5376 troops of the Grand Alliance are moving toward the Ruthenian frontier.
###5381 In Russia, Tsar Nicholas assumes personal command of his forces,
###5385 as his Balkan allies call impatiently for action.
###5388 In the Republic of France, military preparations are already afoot.
###5392 Great Britain puts her armed forces in a state of instant readiness.
###5403 After the funeral, the heads of state will proceed to the royal castle at Minsk.
###5408 Here, close to the Ruthenian border with Germany.
###5411 Just across the valley at Rothenburg is a German army...
###5415 ...commanded by General von Pinck.
###5418 - What do you make of it? - The kaiser is at the conference.
###5421 - What can the German army do? - Nothing.
###5424 But what Lord Bostwick does with the remains of my bureau is the question.
###5430 Mein Gott!
###5432 You might look all right around the board table, my friends,
###5435 but thank God I don't have to take you into battle.
###5439 That goes under the jacket, man.
###5449 The Russian anthem.
###5451 The czar is arriving.
###5453 We shall need an anthem of our own.
###5456 Remind me.
###5458 The czar.
###5480 The others will soon be here.
###5483 The time has come to make a move, gentlemen.
###5486 Are your officers safely under lock and key?
###5488 Quite safe and very angry in their underwear.
###5491 I've sent a limber ahead with our little toy.
###5495 My engineers will have it loaded by the time we arrive.
###5503 There it is, the castle at Minsk.
###5506 All the crowned heads of Europe under one roof, what an opportunity.
###5510 Now, lvan.
###5512 For his lordship, I mean, if war is what he wants.
###5514 With your ideas, I'm surprised you're shocked at war.
###5518 Not at all. It's a matter of business. How can we charge our prices
###5521 with everybody happily killing each other for a shilling a day?
###5525 Look out.
###5550 - What is it? - A bomb.
###5552 It's so big. What will they do?
###5554 - Drop it. - What?
###5555 On the castle. Ride there quickly. It must be evacuated.
###5558 - But the frontier will be guarded. - Ride, I say. I must follow that bomb.
###5571 French president.
###5643 Vorsicht, vorsicht.
###5645 Corporal? Corporal!
###5648 What are you doing? What is that thing?
###5650 Some new sort of bomb. We are to load it.
###5653 Aboard my zeppelin? What's the devil next?
###5655 - General's orders, sir. - This is a naval ship.
###5658 We'll soon see about that.
###5663 Come on, come on, get busy, there.
###5666 Los, get this thing unloaded.
###5668 The general gave me the order himself. Los!
###5671 What the devil are you talking about? Bombs in zeppelins, ridiculous.
###5675 Weg mit dem Objekt. Es muss heute nicht getan werden.
###5685 Get up.
###5702 A life on the ocean wave and here we are in the middle of a forest
###5706 - with a bloody gas bag. - You men there,
###5709 what are you doing? Do up your buttons.
###5712 Where is your officer?
###5713 - Your officer, where is he? - He was here a moment ago.
###5716 Well, he is not here now. I shall take over command.
###5719 General's orders. The zeppelin takes off
###5721 and returns to base immediately. Get that thing away from there.
###5725 Corporal, do you hear me? Get that thing away from here!
###5728 Jawohl, Herr Kapitan.
###5731 Bloody officers.
###5732 - Who is the pilot? - The Herr Kapitan, Herr Kapitan.
###5736 - But he is not here. - Well, I also am a pilot, Herr Kapitan.
###5740 Then why didn't you say so? Get on with it, man.
###5746 Get that thing down here.
###5749 Careful, careful.
###5776 - Hey, you. Where's the officer? - Well, there was one here.
###5779 - Where is he now? - I don't know, Herr General.
###5782 - We've lost one already. - Don't answer back.
###5785 Prepare to take off immediately.
###5788 What are you doing there, corporal?
###5790 - Get that thing aboard. - Jawohl, Herr General.
###5812 - Where are you going? - I must go to the castle.
###5815 You have, have you? The frontier is closed. No one is allowed through.
###5819 The castle must be evacuated. They're gonna bomb it.
###5822 Do you think we're idiots in Ruthenia? Evacuate! They've only just arrived.
###5826 They are going to drop a bomb, I tell you.
###5828 Oh, drop it? Who is going to? An eagle?
###5835 Through you go.
###5837 There are no frontiers for the Sisters of Mercy.
###5843 Will you please listen to me?
###5845 Get out of here, before I have you arrested.
###5856 Heave ho.
###5858 Heave.
###5861 Heave.
###5863 Heave ho.
###5866 Steady. Good.
###5870 Up.
###5872 - Up. Up. - Careful.
###5875 Up. Up.
###5878 Halt.
###5883 The bomb is secured.
###5891 Stand by to cast off.
###5908 Release ballast.
###5913 Cast off of it.
###5917 Cast off now.
###5928 - Set course for Minsk. - Minsk, Herr General?
###5931 Drive and ask no questions.
###5954 Bombs from the air. What a marvelous idea.
###5958 All those little houses down there, just pull a lever and poof! They're gone.
###5968 My God, let's go and see.
###5985 Dragomiloff!
###5998 Revolutionary idea, general, an aerial bomb.
###6002 History in the making. A frightening concept.
###6010 In 15 minutes, we should be over the castle.
###6042 What's that fool up to?
###6057 - What the devil are you doing there? - There's a naval officer onboard.
###6111 Get it back on course.
###6115 The captain. He must have hidden on board.
###6118 - Well, why didn't you search? - He'll give no more trouble.
###6125 - We're back on course. - Not too soon.
###6127 We're approaching the frontier.
###6136 Look! Look!
###6139 So, what is this?
###6141 It is un ballon.
###6146 By Jove! It looks like some sort of airship.
###6152 Nothing is supposed to cross the frontier.
###6154 It's one of those damned zeppelins. Where's that Hun?
###6157 - Good morning. - There you are, Herr Oberleutnant.
###6160 General von Pinck has sent word.
###6162 - It's a patrol for security purposes. - Why was I not informed?
###6166 - Prussians do what they like. - They're invading our frontier.
###6169 Now, then. Now, then. Steady the butts.
###6171 This is supposed to be a peace conference.
###6183 - Starboard two points. - Gentlemen.
###6192 Dragomiloff.
###6194 - It's impossible. - Nothing's impossible, general.
###6198 - This time we'll make quite sure. - Unwise, my lord.
###6201 You see, a bullet through a hydrogen balloon will blow us all out of the sky.
###6207 It's true, my lord. Leave him to me.
###6209 He will not stand a chance.
###6212 I was the saber champion of all Germany.
###6222 En garde.
###6239 Now, here! And here!
###6243 Come on.
###6245 Very good.
###6247 Take this.
###6257 Here, here, here.
###6289 - Get him. - This way. After him.
###6297 Keep her steady.
###6301 Don't do it, Charles. Indiscriminate destruction will engulf you too.
###6305 One death or a million, where's the difference?
###6308 We're surgeons, not butchers. We only kill to destroy evil.
###6311 - Hypocrite. You kill for money. - Only those who deserve to die.
###6315 - We must judge before we kill. - Judge? Young fool.
###6319 You're not an assassin, you're a critic.
###6322 Steady.
###6325 Steady.
###6361 It's jammed.
###6468 Damn you, get out of my way.
###6472 Rise, Sir lvan.
###6478 Your Majesties, you must evacuate the castle immediately.
###6483 Miss Winter, not quite on the spot for once.
###6486 - Ivan, what happened? - Sir lvan, if you please.
###6491 Virtue has been rewarded.
###6493 Well, really.
