MOKO ALI, STUDENT: Hello, CNN STUDENT NEWS.
My name is Moko. I`m in the seventh grade,


2
0:0:6,25 --> 0:0:10,16
I attend the Neighborhood School in Memphis,
Tennessee. And what our school did for the


3
0:0:10,16 --> 0:0:16,86
season of giving, is we attended Loshmanor.
Loshmanor is a place for assisted living and


4
0:0:16,86 --> 0:0:21,12
we sat with them and sang songs, and we also
ate with them.


5
0:0:21,12 --> 0:0:21,9

6
0:0:21,9 --> 0:0:26,53
CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: Fridays are awesome.
A big thanks to Moko for that "I-Report",


7
0:0:26,53 --> 0:0:30,68
we are going to have more season of giving
stories later on. I`m Carl Azuz, this is our


8
0:0:30,68 --> 0:0:46,69
last show of 2012, it starts right now.


9
0:0:46,69 --> 0:0:51,999
Today is December 21st. It is the first official
day of winter, but the weather was not looking


10
0:0:51,999 --> 0:0:57,379
at the calendar, the season`s first blizzard
hit the Midwestern U.S. Early this week, it


11
0:0:57,379 --> 0:1:2,51
was headed and expected to move into New England
today. Tens of thousands of people lost power.


12
0:1:2,51 --> 0:1:7,38
This storm also made driving pretty dangerous,
as you might expect in some areas. Nearly


13
0:1:7,38 --> 0:1:12,409
100 accidents were reported by late Wednesday
morning, including a 30-car pileup on one


14
0:1:12,409 --> 0:1:17,49
Iowa highway. An officer said the snow is
blowing around so badly, the drivers could


15
0:1:17,49 --> 0:1:21,93
only see about five feet in front of their
cars. Blizzard warnings were up yesterday


16
0:1:21,93 --> 0:1:27,24
in Iowa, also in parts of Nebraska, Missouri,
Minnesota, Illinois and Wisconsin. Parts of


17
0:1:27,24 --> 0:1:31,869
Wisconsin had already seen up to seven inches
of snow by yesterday morning. Predictions


18
0:1:31,869 --> 0:1:34,43
said another foot could be on the way.


19
0:1:34,43 --> 0:1:40,79
You`ve heard us talk a lot about the fiscal
cliff, it`s a serious of automatic government


20
0:1:40,79 --> 0:1:44,7
spending cuts and tax increases that`s scheduled
to take place at the beginning of the year.


21
0:1:44,7 --> 0:1:49,28
Now, President Obama and Congress can avoid
this cliff by coming up with a compromise,


22
0:1:49,28 --> 0:1:54,28
a plan to lower the country`s debt. The president
and Republican leaders have both offered some


23
0:1:54,28 --> 0:1:58,95
proposals on how to do this, but when we made
this show Thursday evening, there wasn`t a


24
0:1:58,95 --> 0:2:2,92
deal. The members of the House and Senate
said they`d stay in Washington to keep working


25
0:2:2,92 --> 0:2:8,19
on it, the deadline for a deal is January
First. So make sure to check out cnn.com over


26
0:2:8,19 --> 0:2:10,679
the break for all the latest details.


27
0:2:10,679 --> 0:2:16,1
Today`s "Shoutout" goes out to all the students
and teachers who watch our show around the


28
0:2:16,1 --> 0:2:21,3
globe. In what city will you find the world`s
busiest airport? If you think you know it,


29
0:2:21,3 --> 0:2:33,7
shout it out! Is it London, New York, Tokyo
or Atlanta? You`ve got three seconds, go.


30
0:2:33,7 --> 0:2:38,849
More planes take off inland at Atlanta`s Hartsfield
Jackson Airport than any other airport in


31
0:2:38,849 --> 0:2:42,48
the world. That`s your answer, and that`s
your "Shoutout."


32
0:2:42,48 --> 0:2:51,159
Whether it was by plane, train, automobile
or ship, 2012 was a record breaking year for


33
0:2:51,159 --> 0:2:56,84
travel. According to the UNTO, the United
Nations World Tourism Organization, more than


34
0:2:56,84 --> 0:3:1,1
a billion people traveled outside their countries
this year.


35
0:3:1,1 --> 0:3:4,95
Richard Quest breaks down the numbers on where
these travelers from, where they`re going


36
0:3:4,95 --> 0:3:6,53
to, and why that matters.


37
0:3:6,53 --> 0:3:7,69
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


38
0:3:7,69 --> 0:3:11,43
RICHARD QUEST, HOST, `QUEST MEANS BUSINES":
Where do they come and where do they go? First


39
0:3:11,43 --> 0:3:16,54
of all, where do tourists come from? 53 percent
of international tourism, cross-border tourism


40
0:3:16,54 --> 0:3:22,2
is 53 percent from Europe, 22 percent Asia
Pacific, 17 - well, you can see the numbers


41
0:3:22,2 --> 0:3:30,65
yourself. And those numbers obviously a lot
of it is just literally crossing borders on


42
0:3:30,65 --> 0:3:36,879
short visits. It could be on business, it
could be on vacations, it could be on government


43
0:3:36,879 --> 0:3:39,79
affairs, and where they go?


44
0:3:39,79 --> 0:3:45,23
So, again, most of it is Europe, a large part
of it is Asia Pacific, the Americas and the


45
0:3:45,23 --> 0:3:49,549
Middle East. Obviously, Europe has a disproportionate
amount. It`s because the people are going


46
0:3:49,549 --> 0:3:55,959
from one country to the next. The growing
area, of course, is Asia Pacific. Now, why


47
0:3:55,959 --> 0:4:2,19
tourism matters? It`s really interesting.
Nine percent of global GDP is said to be from


48
0:4:2,19 --> 0:4:6,43
tourism, look at the number of jobs, it says,
look at the amount of exports, six percent


49
0:4:6,43 --> 0:4:12,37
of world trade, incidentally, this is all
from the UNWTO itself. This is why they believe


50
0:4:12,37 --> 0:4:13,189
it matters.


51
0:4:13,189 --> 0:4:14,49
(END VIDEOTAPE)

0:5:6,139 --> 0:5:10,36
continent on the planet. We`ve gone to the

73
0:5:10,36 --> 0:5:15,2
farther into space than ever before. We just
