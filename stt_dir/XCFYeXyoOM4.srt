0:6:9,99 --> 0:6:11,539
the magnificent city in the desert


99
0:6:11,539 --> 0:6:13,339

think about how bad not to five times


109
0:6:39,36 --> 0:6:43,18
just must think of few hundred camels if
not thousands


110
0:6:43,18 --> 0:6:46,8
behind the whole this was this capital
city that they don't


111
0:6:46,8 --> 0:6:50,5
which is that right


112
0:6:50,5 --> 0:6:53,379
petra was perfectly positioned at the
point where several of the ancient


113
0:6:53,379 --> 0:6:59,9
worlds most important trade routes
intersected


114
0:6:59,9 --> 0:7:3,139
from here than i have a chance to trade
with the romans the greeks to the west

119
0:7:17,539 --> 0:7:22,289
the reputation of the matter to insist
that they are the richest of the rich


120
0:7:22,289 --> 0:7:25,75
it's megabucks it's newt gingrich


121
0:7:25,75 --> 0:7:30,249
historians newton who never to be
informed by dynastic kings


122
0:7:30,249 --> 0:7:35,169
and by the first century b_c_ had
settled communities in the area


123
0:7:35,169 --> 0:7:38,659
but no one had suspected that levity
ends what must have been


124
0:7:38,659 --> 0:7:45,419
his capable of creating a city like
petra animosities that is the casting


125
0:7:45,419 --> 0:7:46,75
they disappeared effort


126
0:7:46,75 --> 0:7:47,939
in serbia


127
0:7:47,939 --> 0:7:50,149
four hundred since yest


128
0:7:50,149 --> 0:7:57,309
little of patrick has survived for more
than researchers to investigate


129
0:7:57,309 --> 0:8:1,319
however groundbreaking new work is
starting to unearth the secrets of


130
0:8:1,319 --> 0:8:4,509
levity in engineering


131
0:8:4,509 --> 0:8:8,189
the archaeology is producing
extraordinary results


132
0:8:8,189 --> 0:8:12,18
using these results the mysteries of the
cast many can be unlocked


133
0:8:12,18 --> 0:8:14,939
revealing the secret of its doc purpose


134
0:8:14,939 --> 0:8:18,919
and the great american behind its
construction


135
0:8:18,919 --> 0:8:23,29
the one question its own spring fest


136
0:8:23,29 --> 0:8:28,59
how did the levity ins engineer to make
a structure like the castle


137
0:8:28,59 --> 0:8:36,19
in the middle of the desperate


138
0:8:36,19 --> 0:8:39,79
petra is one of the ancient worlds most
beautiful cities


139
0:8:39,79 --> 0:8:44,36
and the charismatic is it's crowning
glory


140
0:8:44,36 --> 0:8:48,35
experts now where the medicines were
behind its creation


141
0:8:48,35 --> 0:8:51,43
but this discovery provokes and even
bigger ritual


142
0:8:51,43 --> 0:8:56,41
how a group of nomadic traders were able
to construct such and engineering


143
0:8:56,41 --> 0:9:1,25
masterpiece


144
0:9:1,25 --> 0:9:5,67
did such a band appears even more
astonishing one examples of only nobody


145
0:9:5,67 --> 0:9:11,51
an architectural taken into account


146
0:9:11,51 --> 0:9:14,3
advocate is that what you can see here


147
0:9:14,3 --> 0:9:15,31
behind that


148
0:9:15,31 --> 0:9:19,47
and you can see they're pretty player


149
0:9:19,47 --> 0:9:25,8
these basic caracas tumse have dominated
by a simple design called a cruise state


150
0:9:25,8 --> 0:9:30,23

directions


151
0:9:30,23 --> 0:9:31,629
sucrose set


152
0:9:31,629 --> 0:9:33,3
seems to have the


153
0:9:33,3 --> 0:9:37,56
all along with the most difficult type
of seventeen facades


154
0:9:37,56 --> 0:9:38,46
but the charismatic


155
0:9:38,46 --> 0:9:42,27
reasoned and totally differently


156
0:9:42,27 --> 0:9:44,19
well than average in cities hit


157
0:9:44,19 --> 0:9:50,8
is different and probably more
impressive than anywhere else


158
0:9:50,8 --> 0:9:53,86
the challenge facing the buildings was
enormous


159
0:9:53,86 --> 0:9:57,28
experts wanted to work out how they
could scale than you know veggie


160
0:9:57,28 --> 0:9:59,74
conclude to the height of the casting


161
0:9:59,74 --> 0:10:3,13

163
0:10:6,67 --> 0:10:8,71
uh... school goals


164
0:10:8,71 --> 0:10:10,16
uh... screw


165
0:10:10,16 --> 0:10:14,56
supports heat rises

0:10:14,56 --> 0:10:16,75
doctor shah heroin problem


167
0:10:16,75 --> 0:10:19,3
a leading expert on our picture was
built


168
0:10:19,3 --> 0:10:24,48
is focusing on a set of slots to the
sides of the casting


169
0:10:24,48 --> 0:10:29,7
some experts believe that these slots
held scaffolding pose


170
0:10:29,7 --> 0:10:36,65
but in patrons rocky wilderness trees
are in short supply


171
0:10:36,65 --> 0:10:44,78
scaffolding over thirty nine meters high
it would take a foretaste form of tender


172
0:10:44,78 --> 0:10:48,85
doctora baba is convinced them that the
tunes wouldn't have relied on such a


173
0:10:48,85 --> 0:10:50,66
rare commodity


174
0:10:50,66 --> 0:10:53,21
he investigates for that


175
0:10:53,21 --> 0:10:57,25
he finds that the homes are not entirely
square


176
0:10:57,25 --> 0:11:0,59
they are in fact deeper at the base than
the out of the top


177
0:11:0,59 --> 0:11:5,37
circumferential this tooth costs vehicle
with the disease


178
0:11:5,37 --> 0:11:7,8
so you don't think that the


179
0:11:7,8 --> 0:11:9,92
where he was discourse


180
0:11:9,92 --> 0:11:12,5
doctor barbara has a theory


181
0:11:12,5 --> 0:11:15,81
i recently we're used to sarah's let's
close


182
0:11:15,81 --> 0:11:18,23
proposed work a little bit


183
0:11:18,23 --> 0:11:22,3
he believes that these fortunes were
carved long after the cans name was


184
0:11:22,3 --> 0:11:23,36
constructed


185
0:11:23,36 --> 0:11:27,43
perhaps during the medieval period when
the sculptures of living things with


186
0:11:27,43 --> 0:11:31,3
being defensive


187
0:11:31,3 --> 0:11:36,21
this may have been when vandals beheaded
in deface the figures on the cancer


188
0:11:36,21 --> 0:11:37,62
whether medieval or not


189
0:11:37,62 --> 0:11:42,139
dr obama believes the square slots had
nothing to do with the construction of


190
0:11:42,139 --> 0:11:49,21

0:12:1,91 --> 0:12:3,579
we love our respond to all of

0:12:3,579 --> 0:12:5,46
the unfinished warm


196
0:12:5,46 --> 0:12:9,8
it isn't really very important to slip
through


197
0:12:9,8 --> 0:12:14,92
this unfinished tomb unlocks the secrets
of the kasinga's construction


198
0:12:14,92 --> 0:12:19,77
it's brings the digital's to see the
replicas students use

with the risk of food


200
0:12:21,43 --> 0:12:26,1
intersted the view was much more on the
platform


201
0:12:26,1 --> 0:12:32,4
the evidence reveals that the builders
carved not true platform out of the rock


202
0:12:32,4 --> 0:12:36,81
they used this platform is the lead role
in which to standpoint


203
0:12:36,81 --> 0:12:43,5
what's more this discovery indicates a
revolutionary approach to construction


204
0:12:43,5 --> 0:12:48,69
another tns tenant building techniques
on their heads

and here and bureaucrats monuments is
the starting point industry standing


207
0:12:56,29 --> 0:12:58,61
buildings we started from


208
0:12:58,61 --> 0:13:0,37
the foundation


209
0:13:0,37 --> 0:13:7,25
but the band broke up we started from
the top


210
0:13:7,25 --> 0:13:10,3
the buildings not constructed in the
traditional fashion


211
0:13:10,3 --> 0:13:12,51
from the ground up


212
0:13:12,51 --> 0:13:14,45
it was carved out of the rock


213
0:13:14,45 --> 0:13:22,48
from the top


214
0:13:22,48 --> 0:13:27,7
dismantle builders had to start as a
hike to thirty nine meters


215
0:13:27,7 --> 0:13:31,17
they had planned a cousin is location
carefully


216
0:13:31,17 --> 0:13:32,78
natural com tools in the cliffs


217
0:13:32,78 --> 0:13:37,6
formed a narrow groups to the top of
that building site


218
0:13:37,6 --> 0:13:41,14
the time must have been precarious


219
0:13:41,14 --> 0:13:44,47
in fact a simple solution may have used
that way


220
0:13:44,47 --> 0:13:48,5
staffs cut into the rock


221
0:13:48,5 --> 0:13:52,49
many of these cards staircases can still
be seen in the surrounding clues leading


222
0:13:52,49 --> 0:14:1,33
up to the cast


223
0:14:1,33 --> 0:14:7,4
having gained access to the construction
site the hard work begins


224
0:14:7,4 --> 0:14:11,33
the entire job was completed in two
stages


225
0:14:11,33 --> 0:14:16,47
first the heavy work attacking backed
the uneven surface of the cliffs


226
0:14:16,47 --> 0:14:18,39
starting at the top of the casting


227
0:14:18,39 --> 0:14:29,2
the napa tns told them on the walk fast
create the first working platform


228
0:14:29,2 --> 0:14:31,0
from here they worked on


229
0:14:31,0 --> 0:14:32,649
pointing the way the rafters


230
0:14:32,649 --> 0:14:34,21
face to create a smooth


231
0:14:34,21 --> 0:14:38,87
flat working centers


232
0:14:38,87 --> 0:14:41,13
all over the cavs met doctor rub up on


233
0:14:41,13 --> 0:14:45,9
has identified scars in the wrong


234
0:14:45,9 --> 0:14:49,76
these reveal the simple hand-held to
that's required for each stage of its


235
0:14:49,76 --> 0:14:53,49
construction


236
0:14:53,49 --> 0:14:59,91
large couch stars indicate most of this
work was achieved using pick ax


237
0:14:59,91 --> 0:15:1,149
it must have taken a month


238
0:15:1,149 --> 0:15:5,15
ste florio destroyed


239
0:15:5,15 --> 0:15:7,12
criminality and reach the bottom


240
0:15:7,12 --> 0:15:11,16
that blank canvas was ready to pick up


241
0:15:11,16 --> 0:15:16,3
the second stage beginning


242
0:15:16,3 --> 0:15:19,5
the builders climbed back up to the top


243
0:15:19,5 --> 0:15:20,439
'cause another election


244
0:15:20,439 --> 0:15:26,6
and began to painstakingly contradictory
to fiza


245
0:15:26,6 --> 0:15:28,83
every cop had to be perfect


246
0:15:28,83 --> 0:15:36,7
if the builders made a mistake they
couldn't climb back to the past


247
0:15:36,7 --> 0:15:40,4
gravity and stand to lose weight only
made from fruit on it


248
0:15:40,4 --> 0:15:47,26
but they were skillfully used to shape
petra soft sensed it


249
0:15:47,26 --> 0:15:49,15
as they work that way it's done


250
0:15:49,15 --> 0:15:52,98
the builders started to revealed the
finished structure


251
0:15:52,98 --> 0:16:5,7
it was like dropping like flies stone
curtain to unveil masterpiece behind


252
0:16:5,7 --> 0:16:9,3
but very genuine she did not end there


253
0:16:9,3 --> 0:16:12,74
the way in which these desert bill just
dealt with the huge quantities of the


254
0:16:12,74 --> 0:16:16,64
greenwalds brilliantly resourceful


255
0:16:16,64 --> 0:16:20,56
clues from around petra reveal the
secrets of the construction sites do you


256
0:16:20,56 --> 0:16:22,56
want at this


257
0:16:22,56 --> 0:16:28,32
the unwanted rock was removed and great
blocks of stone


258
0:16:28,32 --> 0:16:31,33
trenches were cut into the lecture that
bridge


259
0:16:31,33 --> 0:16:35,97
leaving squares of rock exposed in the
middle


260
0:16:35,97 --> 0:16:40,16
these individuals squares with and leave
it in split off their rocky base


261
0:16:40,16 --> 0:16:44,46
using net trove cleavage points in the
sense to them


262
0:16:44,46 --> 0:16:47,29
rather than waste energy and lowering
the blocks


263
0:16:47,29 --> 0:16:52,14
the mapucchi and simply push them off
the ledge


264
0:16:52,14 --> 0:16:55,8
these great clumps of stonewalling all
the way to become the building blocks


265
0:16:55,8 --> 0:17:2,28
for free-standing structure is nearby


266
0:17:2,28 --> 0:17:4,86
because there was both a construction
site


267
0:17:4,86 --> 0:17:8,13
decor


268
0:17:8,13 --> 0:17:8,86
however


269
0:17:8,86 --> 0:17:13,62
they stopped on construction technique
did not come without a price


270
0:17:13,62 --> 0:17:20,32
there was no margin for error


271
0:17:20,32 --> 0:17:24,2
with a free-standing building workers to
make sure the walls and columns are


272
0:17:24,2 --> 0:17:25,19
strong enough


273
0:17:25,19 --> 0:17:29,63
before adding the weight of the office
sections on top


274
0:17:29,63 --> 0:17:35,87
with a top-down technique pick up the
sections a finished first


275
0:17:35,87 --> 0:17:38,53
if the weight of the opposition's
becomes too heavy


276
0:17:38,53 --> 0:17:45,89
the entire structure could collapse on
top of the workers below


277
0:17:45,89 --> 0:17:50,65
for some to this building is so
surprising


278
0:17:50,65 --> 0:17:52,75
at mccann is a civil engineer


279
0:17:52,75 --> 0:17:56,99
has been examining the structural forces
within the casper


280
0:17:56,99 --> 0:17:59,21
with each other thing ravages of


281
0:17:59,21 --> 0:18:4,179
you realize that what they see as his is
effectively a carving into the place


282
0:18:4,179 --> 0:18:7,72
this when we start talking about it as a
structure and how does it work is a


283
0:18:7,72 --> 0:18:11,37
structure very very different to a
building in the in the conventional


284
0:18:11,37 --> 0:18:12,98
sense


285
0:18:12,98 --> 0:18:20,18
the whole of the cancer is carved from a
single piece of rock


286
0:18:20,18 --> 0:18:24,92
however there is one place which could
still be at risk the portico or entrance


287
0:18:24,92 --> 0:18:25,6
way


288
0:18:25,6 --> 0:18:29,3
that dominates the lower section


289
0:18:29,3 --> 0:18:37,25
hundreds of tons of rock is suspended
over this must entrance space


290
0:18:37,25 --> 0:18:41,73
the solution is a massive stone lynching
which spans the width of the building


291
0:18:41,73 --> 0:18:45,19
and pest this weight


292
0:18:45,19 --> 0:18:50,11
it sits on top of six columns


293
0:18:50,11 --> 0:18:53,49
but even the columns have carved out of
the cliff


294
0:18:53,49 --> 0:18:57,73
while the out before i left imbedded in
the rock face the central two columns


295
0:18:57,73 --> 0:19:0,31
uh... free-standing


296
0:19:0,31 --> 0:19:5,44
it appears as if these two columns take
most of the weight


297
0:19:5,44 --> 0:19:6,999
if this is the case


298
0:19:6,999 --> 0:19:10,429
then the columns have difficulty
absolutely straight to bear the weight


299
0:19:10,429 --> 0:19:13,77
of the lentil upon


300
0:19:13,77 --> 0:19:16,77
big risk


301
0:19:16,77 --> 0:19:23,63
but the napkins knew how to avoid


302
0:19:23,63 --> 0:19:27,14
when we look at that structure which
looks like he's a little wisconsin


303
0:19:27,14 --> 0:19:27,96
forcing it


304
0:19:27,96 --> 0:19:31,69
i mean when you look further you realize
it lynn please still fully attached to


305
0:19:31,69 --> 0:19:37,49
the christmas still politics with andes
invaded into the massive rock at the end


306
0:19:37,49 --> 0:19:41,159
it's it's hard to imagine they even if
we took the central columns away let


307
0:19:41,159 --> 0:19:44,4
this thing will collapse


308
0:19:44,4 --> 0:19:48,91
that is compelling evidence to support
this theory


309
0:19:48,91 --> 0:19:52,12
because many was heavily restored in the
nineteen sixties


310
0:19:52,12 --> 0:19:55,77
before this one of the central columns
was missing


311
0:19:55,77 --> 0:20:1,16
from nineteen th century paintings the
foreman column concretely bc


312
0:20:1,16 --> 0:20:5,26
even without at the casimir remained
intact


313
0:20:5,26 --> 0:20:9,73
the columns anot load them


314
0:20:9,73 --> 0:20:10,429
berlin


315
0:20:10,429 --> 0:20:14,779
in fact the entire facade is fully
supported by the great cliff in which


316
0:20:14,779 --> 0:20:20,1
it's it's


317
0:20:20,1 --> 0:20:25,31
these discovery show that the building
of the cat's name was no fluke


318
0:20:25,31 --> 0:20:28,71
than other teams knew what they wanted
to do


319
0:20:28,71 --> 0:20:30,799
how to do it


320
0:20:30,799 --> 0:20:31,88
people conscious of


321
0:20:31,88 --> 0:20:34,17
absolutely every elements


322
0:20:34,17 --> 0:20:37,52
before they built something like that


323
0:20:37,52 --> 0:20:43,12
the construction was meticulously
planned and carefully managed


324
0:20:43,12 --> 0:20:44,34
refuse


325
0:20:44,34 --> 0:20:46,8
there was


326
0:20:46,8 --> 0:20:50,23
authority the conflicts before leaving
the scope that was reportedly squad even


327
0:20:50,23 --> 0:20:57,1
both also here was the supervisor here
was an architect who designed the he


328
0:20:57,1 --> 0:20:58,66
emphasized


329
0:20:58,66 --> 0:21:0,899
through the architects sleight of hand


330
0:21:0,899 --> 0:21:4,74
than other teams were able to create the
appearance of a massive monumental


331
0:21:4,74 --> 0:21:5,7
structure


332
0:21:5,7 --> 0:21:12,47
for a fraction the engineering
restaurant


333
0:21:12,47 --> 0:21:16,87
few to try and build a building on this
scale and i can't stand up


334
0:21:16,87 --> 0:21:17,649
it would be


335
0:21:17,649 --> 0:21:19,29
proceeded to him


336
0:21:19,29 --> 0:21:22,71
technology and costs and so this is a
cheap and effective


337
0:21:22,71 --> 0:21:29,98
leading fantastic effect


338
0:21:29,98 --> 0:21:33,53
the experts suggest at this time of the
facade spin


339
0:21:33,53 --> 0:21:38,399
but their investigation still had a long
ways to go


340
0:21:38,399 --> 0:21:44,32
questions remain about the interior of
the cat's name and what it was full


341
0:21:44,32 --> 0:21:48,25
and the structures inhospitable location
praised problems with feeding and


342
0:21:48,25 --> 0:21:50,549
watering such a large workforce


343
0:21:50,549 --> 0:21:55,87
indus at temperatures of up to fifty
degrees centigrade


344
0:21:55,87 --> 0:22:0,14
but first another more pressing riddle
lay before them


345
0:22:0,14 --> 0:22:3,86
in spite of all their travel planning
the psych the builders of chosen for the


346
0:22:3,86 --> 0:22:10,44
cast may seem to suicide


347
0:22:10,44 --> 0:22:11,389
the sea


348
0:22:11,389 --> 0:22:15,82
camaro crack in the cliffs opposite was
cut into the rock by thousands of years


349
0:22:15,82 --> 0:22:21,21
of flood water surging along its parts


350
0:22:21,21 --> 0:22:22,879
it could flood suddenly


351
0:22:22,879 --> 0:22:24,66
and unpredictably


352
0:22:24,66 --> 0:22:26,98
and the chasm and its builders lane


353
0:22:26,98 --> 0:22:34,44
right in that spot


354
0:22:34,44 --> 0:22:37,24
bitmap intends to use the site of the
cat's name


355
0:22:37,24 --> 0:22:40,36
the jewel of petra from maximum impact


356
0:22:40,36 --> 0:22:42,67
directly opposite to seek


357
0:22:42,67 --> 0:22:46,99
the narrow twisting gorge that form the
entrance to the city

0:22:46,99 --> 0:22:51,649
but they must have known that the sequel
dot stay dry or thier rock

0:22:55,7 --> 0:22:59,6
if you get a few inches so you get a few
feet an iso


361
0:22:59,6 --> 0:23:3,649
it's totally unpredictable transporting

he's been studying the water management
impex was barren desert


363

in the wet season between november to
march


364
0:23:10,96 --> 0:23:17,24
the rain is sometimes so heavy that the
hard ground cover or soak up the water


365
0:23:17,24 --> 0:23:19,38
instead it triggers destructive


366
0:23:19,38 --> 0:23:24,41
flash floods


367
0:23:24,41 --> 0:23:29,1
his authority of the water is the debris
is carrying at that speed off the flash


368
0:23:29,1 --> 0:23:31,7
floods

0:23:37,12 --> 0:23:38,49
heavy rain storm

0:23:38,49 --> 0:23:44,9

two kilometers long it was called by
centuries of flash flooding


376
0:23:57,9 --> 0:23:58,38
during a heavy down


377
0:23:58,38 --> 0:24:1,57
it was transformed into a raging torrent
of water


378
0:24:1,57 --> 0:24:3,679
one and a half meters d


379
0:24:3,679 --> 0:24:5,46
heading straight for the charismatic


380
0:24:5,46 --> 0:24:8,32
endangering the delicately carved
structure


381
0:24:8,32 --> 0:24:14,87
and extends


382
0:24:14,87 --> 0:24:19,66
but in two thousand and two researchers
discovered a complex system of towns


383
0:24:19,66 --> 0:24:27,61
into thirty meters tumble excavated
through the cliffs


384
0:24:27,61 --> 0:24:31,61
another team builders had anticipated
the danger


385
0:24:31,61 --> 0:24:36,34
the tunnel was parked of an elaborate
plan to deal with the sikhs destructive


386
0:24:36,34 --> 0:24:38,18
hot water


387
0:24:38,18 --> 0:24:42,9
but um... diverted the tolerance of
flood water through the tunnel to a


388
0:24:42,9 --> 0:24:46,3
nearby court bypassing c completely


389
0:24:46,3 --> 0:24:53,52
it's an extraordinary achievement for
engineers working two thousand years ago


390
0:24:53,52 --> 0:24:57,419
they literally held back for a flat


391
0:24:57,419 --> 0:25:1,61
but this wasn't just about protecting
the cast me


392
0:25:1,61 --> 0:25:5,56
recent archaeological work has made a
dramatic breakthrough in the study of


393
0:25:5,56 --> 0:25:8,69
petra


394
0:25:8,69 --> 0:25:16,8
the tunnel is just one element of the
finest water management system


395
0:25:16,8 --> 0:25:16,74
one of the


396
0:25:16,74 --> 0:25:18,24
biggest elements


397
0:25:18,24 --> 0:25:21,64
in the study also have the teens
knocking is


398
0:25:21,64 --> 0:25:25,88
waterworks it's the hydraulic
engineering


399
0:25:25,88 --> 0:25:29,49
it's kaelin sophistication make it one
of the greatest feats of hydraulic


400
0:25:29,49 --> 0:25:33,64
engineering in the ancient world


401
0:25:33,64 --> 0:25:37,399
and its efficiency was second to none


402
0:25:37,399 --> 0:25:41,97
every drop is used in some way or
another so what you basically have would


403
0:25:41,97 --> 0:25:44,63
be a good of continuous


404
0:25:44,63 --> 0:25:47,7
awards supplying throughout the year


405
0:25:47,7 --> 0:25:49,24
actually perfect


406
0:25:49,24 --> 0:25:53,309
to discuss this on to another


407
0:25:53,309 --> 0:25:57,51
power another tns kept their work force
applied with a reliable source of water


408
0:25:57,51 --> 0:26:2,549
in the middle of the test


409
0:26:2,549 --> 0:26:4,11
they understand


410
0:26:4,11 --> 0:26:5,85
importance of


411
0:26:5,85 --> 0:26:7,95
preserve the water


412
0:26:7,95 --> 0:26:10,15
standing water


413
0:26:10,15 --> 0:26:16,12
managing walter if you have not worked
in an area like contract you die


414
0:26:16,12 --> 0:26:19,95
than other teens chairs pictures
location carefully to ensure they could


415
0:26:19,95 --> 0:26:25,95
collect enough water for a constant
supply


416
0:26:25,95 --> 0:26:28,419
actually picture sits at the bottom of
the patient


417
0:26:28,419 --> 0:26:34,31
so if it gets water from warning of this
coming into the central core of the city


418
0:26:34,31 --> 0:26:36,33
as well as collecting rainwater


419
0:26:36,33 --> 0:26:40,57
engineers harvested supply is from
distant spring


420
0:26:40,57 --> 0:26:45,77
off and i would say that uh... every
spring within a fifty-mile radius of the


421
0:26:45,77 --> 0:26:49,41
quarrel picture itself has been tapped


422
0:26:49,41 --> 0:26:55,11
transporting water into such huge
distances is a complex process


423
0:26:55,11 --> 0:27:0,13
allman evidence had with terra cotta
pipes


424
0:27:0,13 --> 0:27:1,55
short sections of pipe


425
0:27:1,55 --> 0:27:3,87
could be placed into what caused cruise


426
0:27:3,87 --> 0:27:9,3
they did in with more time and the joint
sealed with watertight pasta


427
0:27:9,3 --> 0:27:14,8
but they're wants a problem


428
0:27:14,8 --> 0:27:18,56
while more than water systems use deal
that can withstand huge internal


429
0:27:18,56 --> 0:27:19,389
pressures


430
0:27:19,389 --> 0:27:21,639
terra cotta is much weaker


431
0:27:21,639 --> 0:27:24,8
these types of relatively fragile


432
0:27:24,8 --> 0:27:32,96
and a few pressurized and bill blended
joints in pune


433
0:27:32,96 --> 0:27:39,9
than other teams had to find a way to
safely get water through the pipes


434
0:27:39,9 --> 0:27:45,65
their solution can be seen the high up
in the cliffs around the city


435
0:27:45,65 --> 0:27:47,49
they've got to have a system


436
0:27:47,49 --> 0:27:50,969
which doesn't generate significant
internal pressures and once the system


437
0:27:50,969 --> 0:27:55,83
is a constant great system where the war
comes themselves from end to end for


438
0:27:55,83 --> 0:28:1,489
constant gradient manages the forces
within the pipes by controlling the flow


439
0:28:1,489 --> 0:28:3,74
water


440
0:28:3,74 --> 0:28:5,11
if the types of food


441
0:28:5,11 --> 0:28:10,8
the flow of this water exerts huge
pressure on the freemen


442
0:28:10,8 --> 0:28:13,25
if there's an anika between the water
and


443
0:28:13,25 --> 0:28:16,48
the pressure is dramatically reduced


444
0:28:16,48 --> 0:28:19,46
this is called the open channel system


445
0:28:19,46 --> 0:28:20,359
at most


446
0:28:20,359 --> 0:28:23,1
efficient way to get food to the pipe


447
0:28:23,1 --> 0:28:24,93
is to have the plank


448
0:28:24,93 --> 0:28:26,679
to a certain height


449
0:28:26,679 --> 0:28:30,94
this works best when the party's eighty
percent full


450
0:28:30,94 --> 0:28:39,89
interest water pipes work perfectly
designed to achieve this flap


451
0:28:39,89 --> 0:28:44,43
banality ins got the maximum amount of
water through the pacts with a minimum


452
0:28:44,43 --> 0:28:47,9
amount of risk


453
0:28:47,9 --> 0:28:49,48
over two thousand years ago


454
0:28:49,48 --> 0:28:55,38
these ancient people was specialists in
hydraulic engineering


455
0:28:55,38 --> 0:28:59,88
they have massive the hydraulic
principles of four weekend pipeline


456
0:28:59,88 --> 0:29:1,57
systems


457
0:29:1,57 --> 0:29:9,33
to indy career only matched ended twenty
first century


458
0:29:9,33 --> 0:29:12,25
it's one thing to collect ring and
what's next


459
0:29:12,25 --> 0:29:17,3
but quite another challenge to source
water during the drive-ins


460
0:29:17,3 --> 0:29:18,389
the solution


461
0:29:18,389 --> 0:29:21,71
underground water storage


462
0:29:21,71 --> 0:29:27,52
there are two hundred systems within the
city


463
0:29:27,52 --> 0:29:31,49
the engineering genius of the chemical
pipes up off the ground is matched


464
0:29:31,49 --> 0:29:36,95
underground by this complex network of
systems if you look at what's retained


465
0:29:36,95 --> 0:29:39,87
in the sisters you have sharp


466
0:29:39,87 --> 0:29:47,9
almost supply a to sustainability
corporation


467
0:29:47,9 --> 0:29:51,1
what's more the scale of the water
system suggests a city with a population


468
0:29:51,1 --> 0:29:56,909
of fifty thousand people and functions
of visiting traitors


469
0:29:56,909 --> 0:30:0,65
the city was like a man-made oasis in
the test


470
0:30:0,65 --> 0:30:3,94
existence of god


471
0:30:3,94 --> 0:30:5,37
system


472
0:30:5,37 --> 0:30:6,91
everywhere you look


473
0:30:6,91 --> 0:30:10,72
that is that it's beautiful to testing
down from someone else


474
0:30:10,72 --> 0:30:15,21
it reflected the growing ambitions of
its people


475
0:30:15,21 --> 0:30:18,99
monumental buildings were constructed in
the city center


476
0:30:18,99 --> 0:30:22,36
the great templeton trying to run the
main thoroughfare


477
0:30:22,36 --> 0:30:26,11
and the rock coffee otehr and
magnificent royal tombs of the street a


478
0:30:26,11 --> 0:30:26,97
facades


479
0:30:26,97 --> 0:30:30,69
which leads down from the city's
entrance under seek


480
0:30:30,69 --> 0:30:35,5
one way of showing how important you are
on the international scene


481
0:30:35,5 --> 0:30:44,1
is to create a city which eventually
everybody remembers


482
0:30:44,1 --> 0:30:51,2
ivy ultimate embodiment of the netaji
and success is cast


483
0:30:51,2 --> 0:30:53,909
across with it's visitors


484
0:30:53,909 --> 0:31:1,399
is on the explosion and displays or
whilst uh... dipole workers


485
0:31:1,399 --> 0:31:2,379
picket lines


486
0:31:2,379 --> 0:31:4,53
right at the entrance to petra


487
0:31:4,53 --> 0:31:6,87
it must have been put there


488
0:31:6,87 --> 0:31:9,49
to overall visitors to the city


489
0:31:9,49 --> 0:31:11,1
definitely it was


490
0:31:11,1 --> 0:31:15,14
slowing off something


491
0:31:15,14 --> 0:31:19,48
but surely the napkins didn't build this
extraordinary monument just to impress


492
0:31:19,48 --> 0:31:22,49
visitors


493
0:31:22,49 --> 0:31:29,289
what's what's the purpose of the cast


494
0:31:29,289 --> 0:31:33,39
the cliffs of petra pitted with rock cut
structures


495
0:31:33,39 --> 0:31:39,539
that function very different tomb to
temple too huh


496
0:31:39,539 --> 0:31:41,559
from the impressive scale of the cat's
name


497
0:31:41,559 --> 0:31:46,97
it was clearly built for great things
the question is what


498
0:31:46,97 --> 0:31:50,77
the clues lying hidden in the sculpture


499
0:31:50,77 --> 0:31:55,46
the grand facade is adorned with
god-like mythical figures animals and


500
0:31:55,46 --> 0:31:59,85
franz and flies


501
0:31:59,85 --> 0:32:5,39
that these sit in stark contrast to the
usual medicare and decoration


502
0:32:5,39 --> 0:32:9,5
traditionally an aba g_m_'s use
geometric designs depicted records in


503
0:32:9,5 --> 0:32:11,46
the arabian style


504
0:32:11,46 --> 0:32:13,68
as rectangular blocks


505
0:32:13,68 --> 0:32:15,2
because all of these


506
0:32:15,2 --> 0:32:17,4
turning other teens


507
0:32:17,4 --> 0:32:19,98
for centuries the scene


508
0:32:19,98 --> 0:32:21,59
all blocks of snow


509
0:32:21,59 --> 0:32:25,44
far from simple blocks of stone
sculptures on the facade had been


510
0:32:25,44 --> 0:32:27,549
identified as carson's


511
0:32:27,549 --> 0:32:31,57
great warrior women from greek legend


512
0:32:31,57 --> 0:32:36,47
the trial of crisis the egyptian goddess
has been discovered in the center


513
0:32:36,47 --> 0:32:41,83
what just below the head of medusa wants
to have done on visitors


514
0:32:41,83 --> 0:32:44,83
the cosmic is the first as far as we
know


515
0:32:44,83 --> 0:32:45,779
also great


516
0:32:45,779 --> 0:32:50,6
facades which are full of images derived
from other nations


517
0:32:50,6 --> 0:32:53,13
it certainly is the greatest


518
0:32:53,13 --> 0:32:57,28
finality ans gained more than just
twelve from working the desert trade


519
0:32:57,28 --> 0:32:59,17
groups


520
0:32:59,17 --> 0:33:3,35
as they traveled across the eastern
mediterranean they gathered ideas


521
0:33:3,35 --> 0:33:6,39
s artistic styles and beliefs


522
0:33:6,39 --> 0:33:10,29
the gods on the map in sean's eventually
changed


523
0:33:10,29 --> 0:33:14,639
they change appearance they are no
longer just blocks of stone


524
0:33:14,639 --> 0:33:16,809
the local excuse


525
0:33:16,809 --> 0:33:21,809
ices aphrodite to you because of all the
nations that surrounds them


526
0:33:21,809 --> 0:33:25,94
and it is not just the decorations
reflects an adoption of mediterranean


527
0:33:25,94 --> 0:33:28,139
styles


528
0:33:28,139 --> 0:33:29,44
the home facade


529
0:33:29,44 --> 0:33:33,37
mimics the architecture of the classical
world


530
0:33:33,37 --> 0:33:34,87
i think that the


531
0:33:34,87 --> 0:33:37,11
monument ality


532
0:33:37,11 --> 0:33:38,24
and he


533
0:33:38,24 --> 0:33:42,23
influence of egypt is definite that


534
0:33:42,23 --> 0:33:49,6
abt that the entrance of the greek roman
world is also present in the cosmic


535
0:33:49,6 --> 0:33:53,5
it's easy to imagine how the never tns
gathered these ideas spot it's less


536
0:33:53,5 --> 0:33:58,24
obvious why they wanted to copy


537
0:33:58,24 --> 0:34:4,62
the answer isn't relevant today as it
was two thousand years ago


538
0:34:4,62 --> 0:34:6,37
i look at the close of wearing


539
0:34:6,37 --> 0:34:8,0
uncovering


540
0:34:8,0 --> 0:34:10,199
traditional docking in close up


541
0:34:10,199 --> 0:34:12,109
because he uses such and trust


542
0:34:12,109 --> 0:34:14,639
very very similar at that time period


543
0:34:14,639 --> 0:34:17,699
when they can't go wrong and culture


544
0:34:17,699 --> 0:34:20,459
very dominant


545
0:34:20,459 --> 0:34:24,619
as the militants grueling wealth of
knowledge they adopted the fashion since


546
0:34:24,619 --> 0:34:32,329
that day


547
0:34:32,329 --> 0:34:35,469
no through applying this adopted
mythology


548
0:34:35,469 --> 0:34:40,269
the stories hidden inside the sculpture
can be unmarked revealing vital clues


549
0:34:40,269 --> 0:34:43,459
about the great buildings function


550
0:34:43,459 --> 0:34:45,349
yet before he kills


551
0:34:45,349 --> 0:34:46,859
without that date


552
0:34:46,859 --> 0:34:49,649
assault of adds up to have an


553
0:34:49,649 --> 0:34:53,329
at the sides there are six figures off
that singh as always with the double


554
0:34:53,329 --> 0:34:57,259
accent is but that gotten so bad that
sounds


555
0:34:57,259 --> 0:35:1,52
and the two figures at the base of the
charismatic for to be the room and twins


556
0:35:1,52 --> 0:35:3,2
castro and politics


557
0:35:3,2 --> 0:35:8,229
hoop guided people's souls to the
underworld


558
0:35:8,229 --> 0:35:11,42
there's a very strong association was
breath-taking everything almost


559
0:35:11,42 --> 0:35:13,409
everything we see here


560
0:35:13,409 --> 0:35:18,369
and uh... are offer clues to the cast
making dedicated to the dead


561
0:35:18,369 --> 0:35:20,819
dikkat access here


562
0:35:20,819 --> 0:35:24,9
you could see this may seventh


563
0:35:24,9 --> 0:35:28,39
call at the channel leading out tough at
and this would have been for offering


564
0:35:28,39 --> 0:35:31,489
sacrifices so people up about liquid
kind


565
0:35:31,489 --> 0:35:33,549
and see the beautiful fursat


566
0:35:33,549 --> 0:35:35,219
lol cap


567
0:35:35,219 --> 0:35:37,969
sacrifice which could that be


568
0:35:37,969 --> 0:35:41,229
precious audience precious fairfield
inns


569
0:35:41,229 --> 0:35:44,29
maybe is small


570
0:35:44,29 --> 0:35:45,949
for the blood-letting here


571
0:35:45,949 --> 0:35:49,479
habitat that guy that in the basin out
there


572
0:35:49,479 --> 0:35:54,39
offerings and sacrifices to the dead
were an important part of the napkins


573
0:35:54,39 --> 0:35:56,489
beliefs


574
0:35:56,489 --> 0:36:0,239
the evidence of death and ritual
tantalizing hints of the cast makes


575
0:36:0,239 --> 0:36:5,669
function but they do not repeal of the
buildings true purpose


576
0:36:5,669 --> 0:36:8,54
it could still be at temple monument


577
0:36:8,54 --> 0:36:11,699
bull too


578
0:36:11,699 --> 0:36:17,359
perhaps the final terms would lie inside


579
0:36:17,359 --> 0:36:21,899
but after the glories of the facade
interior of the cast becomes as a


580
0:36:21,899 --> 0:36:23,219
surprise


581
0:36:23,219 --> 0:36:27,189
new great suite of rooms or elaborate
decoration here


582
0:36:27,189 --> 0:36:32,309
just a simple main chamber twelve meter
square thirty meters high


583
0:36:32,309 --> 0:36:40,189
with to side rooms at the front


584
0:36:40,189 --> 0:36:46,599
the task of creating them without modern
technology is almost unimaginative


585
0:36:46,599 --> 0:36:50,479
the scene sign it would have been
horrendous the absolute with choking


586
0:36:50,479 --> 0:36:53,529
dust


587
0:36:53,529 --> 0:36:57,729
the burials origins vertical on


588
0:36:57,729 --> 0:37:2,109
conditioner lol result


589
0:37:2,109 --> 0:37:6,679
only small oil lamps contribute fairways
staked went into the heart of the


590
0:37:6,679 --> 0:37:8,609
clinton


591
0:37:8,609 --> 0:37:12,39
bedrooms for this telescope just iron
pics chisels


592
0:37:12,39 --> 0:37:15,699
and that that happens


593
0:37:15,699 --> 0:37:22,199
the chambers were carved using the same
top dog technique is the outside facade


594
0:37:22,199 --> 0:37:26,219
when the covers reach the level below
the great clinton work started on the in


595
0:37:26,219 --> 0:37:28,399
their homes


596
0:37:28,399 --> 0:37:31,6
but on one was cut directly into the
truth


597
0:37:31,6 --> 0:37:35,589
and was white to create the portico
behind the columns


598
0:37:35,589 --> 0:37:41,259
from this further troubles will cut to
create the roofs of the changes


599
0:37:41,259 --> 0:37:45,949
the only clues to discover technique to
windows above the doorways which served


600
0:37:45,949 --> 0:37:50,329
as the first time entrances


601
0:37:50,329 --> 0:37:52,82
then this work continues on the facade


602
0:37:52,82 --> 0:37:55,659
and it's working platform dropped dot on
the plane


603
0:37:55,659 --> 0:37:58,329
the floors of the chambers forward


604
0:37:58,329 --> 0:38:0,479
apocalyptic on


605
0:38:0,479 --> 0:38:4,299
goes on to six carl


606
0:38:4,299 --> 0:38:9,49
propose four-wheel warped problems for
you because


607
0:38:9,49 --> 0:38:13,739
foreign and gunshot to start doing six
thousand cubic meters of rock from the


608
0:38:13,739 --> 0:38:14,579
chamber


609
0:38:14,579 --> 0:38:17,639
the equivalent of two olympic swimming
pool


610
0:38:17,639 --> 0:38:19,919
filled with stones


611
0:38:19,919 --> 0:38:26,129
it's an incredible achievement


612
0:38:26,129 --> 0:38:29,839
but hard labor was not the only secret
of their success


613
0:38:29,839 --> 0:38:37,99
despite its simplicity of the chamber
required careful engineering


614
0:38:37,99 --> 0:38:42,79
above it lies the crushing force of more
than a hundred and sixty meters of solid


615
0:38:42,79 --> 0:38:44,459
rock


616
0:38:44,459 --> 0:38:47,929
he's got a great deal of saying about
you


617
0:38:47,929 --> 0:38:53,29
tens of millions of world all of which
all whiting down on top of this whole


618
0:38:53,29 --> 0:38:57,7
and there loads have to be transmitted
somewhere and what happens is that the


619
0:38:57,7 --> 0:39:1,86
loads will follow the stiffest
cost-effectively the loads pushing


620
0:39:1,86 --> 0:39:3,49
around the side


621
0:39:3,49 --> 0:39:5,469
off the kinds of most of the senate yes


622
0:39:5,469 --> 0:39:10,119
the problem comes if the chamber is made
too wide


623
0:39:10,119 --> 0:39:14,759
they're going to love the bars would not
be able to my kids loggia anywhere on


624
0:39:14,759 --> 0:39:17,679
the side person in the middle east


625
0:39:17,679 --> 0:39:19,239
breakthrough like that


626
0:39:19,239 --> 0:39:22,809
than other students clearly understood
the limits of their design


627
0:39:22,809 --> 0:39:34,369
they kept the interior chambers small
enough to prevent a catastrophic ruth


628
0:39:34,369 --> 0:39:39,59
but the simplicity of the interior space
gave archaeologists no clues to the


629
0:39:39,59 --> 0:39:42,809
callousness religious function


630
0:39:42,809 --> 0:39:46,919
quite a lot of speculations about uh...
what this has been


631
0:39:46,919 --> 0:39:48,749
there have been was at the temple


632
0:39:48,749 --> 0:39:51,589
but it does not


633
0:39:51,589 --> 0:39:55,9
the correct divisions


634
0:39:55,9 --> 0:39:57,609
another weather was it's just too


635
0:39:57,609 --> 0:40:0,859
again


636
0:40:0,859 --> 0:40:3,739
arnaz sides of mario's in there


637
0:40:3,739 --> 0:40:7,949
the interior has no trace of a better no
sarcophagus


638
0:40:7,949 --> 0:40:11,989
new clean where one would have stored


639
0:40:11,989 --> 0:40:16,739
without any signs of a bloody it could
not be a too


640
0:40:16,739 --> 0:40:21,949
perhaps the kashmir was a monument on
during the great king


641
0:40:21,949 --> 0:40:23,22
presently s


642
0:40:23,22 --> 0:40:27,51
such large scale it's mustn't be invoked
by somebody extremely wealthy and


643
0:40:27,51 --> 0:40:28,949
powerful


644
0:40:28,949 --> 0:40:32,529
must have been picking


645
0:40:32,529 --> 0:40:34,599
this is another question


646
0:40:34,599 --> 0:40:37,809
archaeologists were only able to take
the casting to a rough


647
0:40:37,809 --> 0:40:41,519
four hundred and fifty year winter on
the birth of christ


648
0:40:41,519 --> 0:40:43,49
and during this period


649
0:40:43,49 --> 0:40:49,519
any of several liberty and kings
could've built the structure


650
0:40:49,519 --> 0:40:54,279
with no further needs to follow it seems
like as maze true purpose would never be


651
0:40:54,279 --> 0:41:1,959
discovered


652
0:41:1,959 --> 0:41:6,229
but then archaeologists made a startling
breakthrough


653
0:41:6,229 --> 0:41:9,979
in nineteen ninety-six they found
evidence that the ground level in front


654
0:41:9,979 --> 0:41:14,439
of the casket was much lower in netaji
and time


655
0:41:14,439 --> 0:41:19,229
declared one-man on a journey of
underground exploration to find what


656
0:41:19,229 --> 0:41:27,879
lies beneath and to unlock the kashmiris
last secret


657
0:41:27,879 --> 0:41:33,339
why the new evidence proof that hasn't
has remained a mystery for centuries


658
0:41:33,339 --> 0:41:37,979
no groundbreaking new discovery his
revealed crucial clues to its true


659
0:41:37,979 --> 0:41:39,159
purpose


660
0:41:39,159 --> 0:41:39,92
ebbing


661
0:41:39,92 --> 0:41:44,56
discoveries in excavations but nothing
quite as important is this particular


662
0:41:44,56 --> 0:41:45,749
one


663
0:41:45,749 --> 0:41:47,289
it's excavations act


664
0:41:47,289 --> 0:41:53,709
more informations for this beautiful and
unique we'll make it happen


665
0:41:53,709 --> 0:41:59,799
suman fund transfer is director of the
picture archaeological haha


666
0:41:59,799 --> 0:42:4,39
fighter jet news of the paved surface of
the sikh the winding korchi leading into


667
0:42:4,39 --> 0:42:5,259
petra


668
0:42:5,259 --> 0:42:10,329
disappears beneath the sand three
hundred meters before it's and


669
0:42:10,329 --> 0:42:12,319
he had a hug


670
0:42:12,319 --> 0:42:15,369
if the pols continued its downward
trajectory


671
0:42:15,369 --> 0:42:22,219
it would reach the has made well below
decks current ground level


672
0:42:22,219 --> 0:42:26,619
there could be an entire hidden level of
the council is submerged beneath


673
0:42:26,619 --> 0:42:31,449
centuries of sent


674
0:42:31,449 --> 0:42:39,219
so in two thousand and three he started
a major excavation


675
0:42:39,219 --> 0:42:43,969
but his gamble soon paid off


676
0:42:43,969 --> 0:42:49,419
six meters below the surface he made a
discovery


677
0:42:49,419 --> 0:42:51,49
barrier chambers


678
0:42:51,49 --> 0:42:59,49
inside with the bones of eleven
individuals


679
0:42:59,49 --> 0:43:0,359
close the file


680
0:43:0,359 --> 0:43:2,759
to we had a strategy


681
0:43:2,759 --> 0:43:4,949
there we found a very unfair


682
0:43:4,949 --> 0:43:7,939
burial from and


683
0:43:7,939 --> 0:43:10,44
and some


684
0:43:10,44 --> 0:43:12,849
hanging the offerings light


685
0:43:12,849 --> 0:43:15,199
uses


686
0:43:15,199 --> 0:43:18,25
the kashmiri is more than just a moment


687
0:43:18,25 --> 0:43:22,199
it is a more slowly and with the
critical needs


688
0:43:22,199 --> 0:43:24,929
but who's buried


689
0:43:24,929 --> 0:43:32,69
all these the skeletons of the castle is
royal builder and his family


690
0:43:32,69 --> 0:43:33,51
to identify the king


691
0:43:33,51 --> 0:43:41,419
fighter jet needed to take to the better
deals


692
0:43:41,419 --> 0:43:45,199
gas attacks updated

pairs toward the beginning of the
crescent remarried


694
0:43:49,449 --> 0:43:52,319
with the date of the first century eight
d


695
0:43:52,319 --> 0:43:57,419
finally the likely identity of the
callousness king is revealed


696
0:43:57,419 --> 0:43:59,939
i believe that president


697
0:43:59,939 --> 0:44:1,89

greatest and most successful group


700
0:44:12,819 --> 0:44:16,419
as i think that uh... because it was
both biking access apart

0:44:29,88 --> 0:44:30,829
the fourth


705
0:44:30,829 --> 0:44:35,499

good use


706
0:44:35,499 --> 0:44:41,189
experts believe he was pictures most
infamous e_s_t_ develop


707
0:44:41,189 --> 0:44:46,369
he is attributed with constructing the
great temperance and city streets


708
0:44:46,369 --> 0:44:50,589
knowledge seems he also built actress
most reluctant structure


709
0:44:50,589 --> 0:44:53,959
as his family's more civilian


710

patted doing wonderfully square towards


714
0:45:6,819 --> 0:45:9,889
though the king himself is thought to be
buried elsewhere


715
0:45:9,889 --> 0:45:14,229
these underground tunes could contain
the remains of his relatives lying


716
0:45:14,229 --> 0:45:17,479
beneath the cast


717
0:45:17,479 --> 0:45:23,9

0:45:36,829 --> 0:45:41,59
thriving religious complex


721
0:45:41,59 --> 0:45:43,16
the fact that archaeologists have found


722
0:45:43,16 --> 0:45:45,999
bosley incense and guests


723
0:45:45,999 --> 0:45:52,649
to the gods or suggested that this is a
place in question


724
0:45:52,649 --> 0:45:56,659
the discoveries of alternatives and
ritual offerings implying that this was


725
0:45:56,659 --> 0:45:58,729
a place of public celebration

727
0:46:1,789 --> 0:46:6,529
no all these discoveries according to
compete we think of petra and the napa

jim's place in history


729
0:46:8,409 --> 0:46:11,199
the perception of the leopard skins

0:46:11,199 --> 0:46:15,339
has changed dramatically even in the
last ten years


731
0:46:15,339 --> 0:46:17,979
they will march more than desert radius


732
0:46:17,979 --> 0:46:21,719
they would accomplished architects

combining inspirations from other
cultures with a an ingenious engineering


734
0:46:26,869 --> 0:46:30,799
than other teams created an incredible
structure

0:46:30,799 --> 0:46:35,889
they are an extraordinary civilization
there an extraordinary people


736
0:46:35,889 --> 0:46:36,849
and the canceling


737
0:46:36,849 --> 0:46:40,92
is the greatest achievement


738
0:46:40,92 --> 0:46:43,9
it stands today
