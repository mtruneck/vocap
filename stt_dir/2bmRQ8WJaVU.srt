CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: Hi. Welcome to a new
week of CNN STUDENT NEWS. I`m Carl Azuz. First


4
0:0:28,67 --> 0:0:32,969
up today, a little history in the making:
four of these famous first were heading over


5
0:0:32,969 --> 0:0:38,789
to South Korea. As of today, that country
has a brand new leader. Park Geun-hye is 61


6
0:0:38,789 --> 0:0:42,8
years old. She won the presidential election
last December and by now you`ve probably guessed


7
0:0:42,8 --> 0:0:48,17
why her win is historic. Park is South Korea`s
first female president. But it`s not the first


8
0:0:48,17 --> 0:0:52,6
time she`s been connected to the South Korean
presidency. In fact, her experience around


9
0:0:52,6 --> 0:0:56,94
this job started when she was younger than
all of you.


10
0:0:56,94 --> 0:1:1,28
While the world may not know much about South
Korea`s first female president, the life of


11
0:1:1,28 --> 0:1:7,39
Park Geun-hye and her family fill her nation`s
history books. Born into politics, her father


12
0:1:7,39 --> 0:1:12,189
Park Chung-hee was described by some as the
country`s first dictator. He seized power


13
0:1:12,189 --> 0:1:17,88
when the military took control of the government
in 1961. Park was just nine years old then.


14
0:1:17,88 --> 0:1:22,909
Her father would rule South Korea with an
iron fist for the next 18 years overseeing


15
0:1:22,909 --> 0:1:28,829
huge economic growth as well as human rights
abuses. Personal tragedy hit Park Geun-hye


16
0:1:28,829 --> 0:1:34,95
while she was studying overseas in 1974. Back
in Seoul, her mother was shot dead by someone


17
0:1:34,95 --> 0:1:40,56
loyal to North Korea. The bullet was intended
for Park`s father. The failed assassination


18
0:1:40,56 --> 0:1:45,679
attempt drastically changed the course of
Park Geun-hye`s life. Her dreams of being


19
0:1:45,679 --> 0:1:50,71
a professor were set aside. She had act as
South Korea`s first lady putting the nation`s


20
0:1:50,71 --> 0:1:54,869
interests above her own. Five years later,
there was another assassination attempt on


21
0:1:54,869 --> 0:2:0,69
her father. This time it was successful. His
intelligence chief shot him at a dinner party


22
0:2:0,69 --> 0:2:5,159
saying he wanted South Korea to become a free
democracy. It was two decades later that Park


23
0:2:5,159 --> 0:2:10,55
Geun- hye decided to return to the public`s
spotlight and launch her own political career.


24
0:2:10,55 --> 0:2:15,38
And then last December, as head of the Conservative
Party, this 61 years old who never married


25
0:2:15,38 --> 0:2:20,86
and doesn`t have children was elected president
with an overwhelming majority. One of her


26
0:2:20,86 --> 0:2:26,11
major challenges as president will be dealing
with North Korea. She met the late Kim Jong-il


27
0:2:26,11 --> 0:2:31,53
in 2002 in an attempt to end the bad blood
between the two families. Park Geun-hye says


28
0:2:31,53 --> 0:2:36,55
she wants to resume talks with North Korea
and restart the aid program on the condition


29
0:2:36,55 --> 0:2:41,87
that North Korea abandons its nuclear weapons
program. But after its third nuclear test,


30
0:2:41,87 --> 0:2:48,52
analysts believe North Korean leader Kim Jong
Un clearly isn`t interested.


31
0:2:48,52 --> 0:2:52,61
Heading to Japan for our next story. Engineers
there getting rid of an old hotel in Tokyo.

0:2:53,65 --> 0:2:53,99
(EXPLOSION)


34
0:2:53,99 --> 0:2:55,3
(END VIDEO CLIP)


35
0:2:55,3 --> 0:2:59,15
AZUZ: But not like that. They`re trying a
different demolition approach. Say hello to


36
0:2:59,15 --> 0:3:4,87
the incredible shrinking building. This hotel
is 40 stories tall, and engineers were taking


37
0:3:4,87 --> 0:3:9,97
it away one story at a time. May not look
like much on the outside, but check out what`s


38
0:3:9,97 --> 0:3:15,2
happening on the inside. The crews go floor
by floor using temporary jacks - those hold


39
0:3:15,2 --> 0:3:19,89
up the higher floor while the workers take
out beams, support columns and debris. Then


40
0:3:19,89 --> 0:3:25,51
the jacks lower what`s left and the crew moves
on. Why do it this way? That`s a lot quieter


41
0:3:25,51 --> 0:3:30,0
than a standard demolition which keeps the
neighbors happy, and new chance of an implosion


42
0:3:30,0 --> 0:3:35,73
damaging other buildings. It`s also more expensive
and it takes longer - in this case, and estimated


43
0:3:35,73 --> 0:3:37,39
six or seven months.


44
0:3:37,39 --> 0:3:39,9
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


45
0:3:39,9 --> 0:3:46,59
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: See if you can I.D. me:
you`ll find me in space about 93 million miles


46
0:3:46,59 --> 0:3:52,46
from Earth. Also, I`m made up of different
gases. Astronomers consider me a yellow dwarf


47
0:3:52,46 --> 0:4:2,48
star and I`m the closest star to your planet.
I`m the Sun. And the temperature at my core


48
0:4:2,48 --> 0:4:6,23
is believed to be 27 million degrees Fahrenheit.


49
0:4:6,23 --> 0:4:8,45
(END VIDEO CLIP)


50
0:4:8,45 --> 0:4:13,12
AZUZ: So, the sun is hot. And what you`re
seeing according to NASA is an eruption on


51
0:4:13,12 --> 0:4:18,26
the Sun surface. It`s set up a bunch of fiery
plasma, and that appeared to rain back down


52
0:4:18,26 --> 0:4:23,59
in a circular ark. Look, how in comparison,
the Earth is so much smaller than this eruption


53
0:4:23,59 --> 0:4:29,73
alone. The sun is thought to be about 109
times the width of the Earth. A couple of


54
0:4:29,73 --> 0:4:34,29
other things here: this was recorded last
summer, and it`s sped up. Every second you


55
0:4:34,29 --> 0:4:39,4
see is about six minutes of real time. Scientists
say the Sun`s magnetic field caused the plasma


56
0:4:39,4 --> 0:4:44,51
to cascade in a circle. And fans of Adele
might appreciate how the Sun set fire to the


57
0:4:44,51 --> 0:4:44,94
rain.


58
0:4:44,94 --> 0:4:48,95
Yesterday, was the Daytona 500. We`re not
worried about who took the checkered flag


59
0:4:48,95 --> 0:4:51,9
on Sunday. We`re talking about what happened
there on Saturday.


60
0:4:51,9 --> 0:4:52,25
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


61
0:4:52,25 --> 0:4:55,36
TONY STEWART, NASCAR DRIVER: I`ve never seen
anything like that. I mean we`ve seen Petty,


62
0:4:55,36 --> 0:4:59,43
you know, we`ve seen a lot of big ones here.
And I`ve been a part of a couple of big ones


63
0:4:59,43 --> 0:5:1,1
here, but I`ve never seen anything like that.


64
0:5:1,1 --> 0:5:1,33
(END VIDEO CLIP)


65
0:5:1,33 --> 0:5:5,56
AZUZ: He`s talking about a wreck in the final
lap of a warm-up race. Sports come with risk,


66
0:5:5,56 --> 0:5:10,88
that`s something Nascar drivers all deal with,
but not usually the fans. Some of the debris


67
0:5:10,88 --> 0:5:16,889
from this crash flew into, over and threw
a protective fans. At least 28 people in the


68
0:5:16,889 --> 0:5:21,5
stands were injured, some were taken to hospitals,
others were checked out by a medical staff


69
0:5:21,5 --> 0:5:22,6
at the track.


70
0:5:22,6 --> 0:5:27,22
It`s been about four months since the so-called
Superstorm Sandy hit the northeastern U.S.


71
0:5:27,22 --> 0:5:30,84
People are still feeling the effects of the
storm, working to rebuild homes and businesses.


72
0:5:30,84 --> 0:5:35,92
But it`s not just people who were affected.
Natural disasters can take a toll on the natural


73
0:5:35,92 --> 0:5:40,77
habitat of animals as well. When that happens,
the creatures may be forced into new areas.


74
0:5:40,77 --> 0:5:43,29
In the New York City, that`s causing some
problems.


75
0:5:43,29 --> 0:5:44,33
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


76
0:5:44,33 --> 0:5:49,17
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Night descends on New
York City, and things can get pretty creepy.


77
0:5:49,17 --> 0:5:55,65
And after Superstorm Sandy, even creepier.
Terry Riggio says the rat problem in her hard-hit


78
0:5:55,65 --> 0:5:57,34
Lower Manhattan neighborhood exploded.


79
0:5:57,34 --> 0:6:1,55
THERESA RIGGIO, NEW YORK RESIDENT: It`s crazy.
You come home from work, you see a rat. It


80
0:6:1,55 --> 0:6:7,5
could be daylight, you see a rat. Your walk
your dogs past nighttime, you see rats frolicking


81
0:6:7,5 --> 0:6:11,5
like they are playing like they are pets having
fun. It`s disgusting.


82
0:6:11,5 --> 0:6:16,49
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: When Sandy flooded subways
and tunnels, the theory is rats were literally


83
0:6:16,49 --> 0:6:22,29
flushed out, forced to relocate and they`re
staying put. Traps to try and catch them dart


84
0:6:22,29 --> 0:6:27,47
streets in Lower Manhattan where construction
has only compounded the problem.


85
0:6:27,47 --> 0:6:32,49
Timothy Wong says, his pest-control company
is constantly trying to stock up on supplies.


86
0:6:32,49 --> 0:6:36,71
TIMOTHY WONG, M&M PEST CONTROL: We even have,
believe it or not, for these really nice fancy


87
0:6:36,71 --> 0:6:42,33
areas in Manhattan where they can`t use really
ugly base station, they have live rock base


88
0:6:42,33 --> 0:6:46,26
stations where, you know, it looks like a
rock and you can`t tell, but inside there`s


89
0:6:46,26 --> 0:6:49,88
actually a whole where the rats can go in,
where you can actually put poison in there.


90
0:6:49,88 --> 0:6:54,24
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Wang says his company,
M&M pest control has gotten more than twice


91
0:6:54,24 --> 0:6:59,919
as many complaints about rats and mice compared
to a year ago at this time. It`s not what


92
0:6:59,919 --> 0:7:4,75
the Health Department says it`s seeing. Saying
that while large storms can flush out rats,


93
0:7:4,75 --> 0:7:6,3
they can also drown them.


94
0:7:6,3 --> 0:7:8,82
JEFF WOODS, M&M PEST CONTROL: Some poison
up in the ceiling ...


95
0:7:8,82 --> 0:7:13,76
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Growing numbers are not.
M&M exterminator Jeff Woods says he sees New


96
0:7:13,76 --> 0:7:15,44
York in a whole different light.


97
0:7:15,44 --> 0:7:20,46
WOODS: So it is three years of doing it, we
kind of get a - you`re always looking over


98
0:7:20,46 --> 0:7:20,889
your shoulder.


99
0:7:20,889 --> 0:7:24,69
WANG: It`s been keeping us busy. People`s
nightmare is really, you know, a good day


100
0:7:24,69 --> 0:7:25,21
for us.

103
0:7:26,75 --> 0:7:30,9
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today`s "Shoutout" goes
out Ms. Flatebo`s class at Lincoln Intermediate


104
0:7:30,9 --> 0:7:36,69
School n Mason City, Iowa. Which of these
is a measurement of the imperfections in a


105
0:7:36,69 --> 0:7:50,93
diamond? Here we go, is it cut, color, carat
or clarity? You`ve got three seconds, go!


106
0:7:50,93 --> 0:7:57,419
A diamond`s clarity refers to how many imperfections
the stone does or does not have. That`s your


107
0:7:57,419 --> 0:7:59,86
answer and that`s your "Shoutout".

109
0:8:2,13 --> 0:8:6,49
AZUZ: Diamonds and people have imperfections,
but what Billy Ray Harris did when he found


110
0:8:6,49 --> 0:8:8,13
a diamond ring was flawless.


111
0:8:8,13 --> 0:8:8,669
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


112
0:8:8,669 --> 0:8:12,29
BILLY RAY HARRIS: What I actually feel like
is what has the world come to when a person


113
0:8:12,29 --> 0:8:14,36
to return something that don`t belong to him.


114
0:8:14,36 --> 0:8:18,82
AZUZ: Billy is homeless. He lives in Kansas
City, so does Sarah Darling. One day Sarah


115
0:8:18,82 --> 0:8:23,96
gave Billy some change, and accidentally gave
him her ring, too. When Sarah came back, Billy


116
0:8:23,96 --> 0:8:26,8
was ready to hand the ring back over.


117
0:8:26,8 --> 0:8:28,29
SARAH DARLING: So, I just am so grateful.


118
0:8:28,29 --> 0:8:32,289
RAY HARRIS: I could tell exactly how much
it meant to you the moment I held it up like


119
0:8:32,289 --> 0:8:32,519
that.


120
0:8:32,519 --> 0:8:32,76
(LAUGHTER)


121
0:8:32,76 --> 0:8:33,229
DARLING: Yes.


122
0:8:33,229 --> 0:8:33,939
(END VIDEO CLIP)


123
0:8:33,939 --> 0:8:38,559
AZUZ: Billy says, he acted the way his grandfather
who raised him would have expected, and wasn`t


124
0:8:38,559 --> 0:8:42,869
looking for a reward. Sarah and her husband
started the fundraiser to thank Billy, though.


125
0:8:42,869 --> 0:8:51,79
Their goal was to raise $1000. As of yesterday,
donations were up to $139,000 and counting.


126
0:8:51,79 --> 0:8:55,439
Some friends of mine were debating this, if
they found $5 in the ground and no one was


127
0:8:55,439 --> 0:8:59,49
around, they`ll probably keep it. But for
something as valuable as a ring, they`d try


128
0:8:59,49 --> 0:9:4,66
to find its owner or at least a lost and found.
What is the cut off? Join in today`s blog

130
0:9:5,74 --> 0:9:13,749
We`re going to wrap things up today with a
little friendly teasing. The frog is a little


131
0:9:13,749 --> 0:9:18,569
odd, but that`s not what this Youtube clips
are about, it`s about how the dogs react.


132
0:9:18,569 --> 0:9:22,97
Some flip out, some are confused. What they
do seem to know is that it sounds exactly


133
0:9:22,97 --> 0:9:27,819
like one of their squeaky toys. Unfortunately
for them, there is no chance the dog sinking


134
0:9:27,819 --> 0:9:32,129
their teeth into this thing, which means there
is no danger of the frog croaking. We`re going


135
0:9:32,129 --> 0:9:35,779
to end with that ribbitting story. Teachers,
don`t forget to visit out page and give us


136
0:9:35,779 --> 0:11:35,779
your feedback on today`s show. We`ll hop back
