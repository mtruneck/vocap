FREUND: The brain initiative recently announced
by the White House is really designed to facilitate


2
0:0:11,589 --> 0:0:16,91
innovative strategies to better understand
the brain. And in order to do that we need


3
0:0:16,91 --> 0:0:22,2
new technologies. CLARITY is a great example
of the type of new technologies that will


4
0:0:22,2 --> 0:0:25,16
enable future brain studies.


5
0:0:25,16 --> 0:0:31,3
So prior to this technology, scientists used
methods where they would take thin slices


6
0:0:31,3 --> 0:0:38,4
of the brain. They would put these on glass
slides, process them with antibodies, which


7
0:0:38,4 --> 0:0:44,87
illuminate what chemicals are there. And then
they would have to use a microscope to study


8
0:0:44,87 --> 0:0:49,22
which transmitters are in which locations.
Unfortunately, you can’t see the structure


9
0:0:49,22 --> 0:0:52,21
of a neuron in a brain slice.


10
0:0:52,21 --> 0:0:57,98
So with this technology, they’re able to
look at the entire neuron in a three dimensional


11
0:0:57,98 --> 0:1:5,95
volume. And with this three dimensional structure
intact, you can see where the neuron starts


12
0:1:5,95 --> 0:1:12,359
and what brain region it projects to. In slices,
you can only see what’s in the position


13
0:1:12,359 --> 0:1:18,149
where you started. And what this technology
will allow is to do is not only study what


14
0:1:18,149 --> 0:1:25,1
molecular or single elements of a cell are
located in a neuron, but how those communicate


15
0:1:25,1 --> 0:1:27,399
with other elements in the brain.


16
0:1:27,399 --> 0:1:31,479
So in the recent publication by Deisseroth
and colleagues, they describe not only the


17
0:1:31,479 --> 0:1:37,49
ability to look at animal models – or whole
brains of animals – but also the ability


18
0:1:37,49 --> 0:1:43,499
to look in human brain. So in a post-mortem
brain from a child suffering from autism,


19
0:1:43,499 --> 0:1:49,889
they were able to trace neuronal projections
from a significant volume of tissue. They’re


20
0:1:49,889 --> 0:1:57,74
also able to use the technology to stain for
neurochemicals located in that brain region.


21
0:1:57,74 --> 0:2:2,49
And the potential for this type of research
is great for understanding how disruptions


22
0:2:2,49 --> 0:2:9,489
in neural circuitry are involved in disorders.
It has really transformative potential.


23
0:2:9,489 --> 0:2:16,19
The technology shows us in the video an area
of the brain that’s involved in memory,


24
0:2:16,19 --> 0:2:21,599
the hippocampus. And this video shows the
neurons that are involved in processing memory,


25
0:2:21,599 --> 0:2:27,72
where they project, and what neurotransmitters,
or chemicals are contained in those neurons.


26
0:2:27,72 --> 0:2:31,78
And it shows this in three dimensions, so
you see not only where they start and where


27
0:2:31,78 --> 0:2:35,4
they project and how they might interact to
form memories.


28
0:2:35,4 --> 0:2:41,269
The video through an entire mouse brain shows
us how neurons are connected. So the neural


29
0:2:41,269 --> 0:2:45,959
circuitry – which neurons project to which
areas in the brain, how they might be involved


30
0:2:45,959 --> 0:2:52,849
in giving commands to execute certain functions
that we know about from physiology studies,


31
0:2:52,849 --> 0:2:57,79
but we don’t actually know how they connect
to each other. This technology allows you


32
0:2:57,79 --> 0:4:57,79
to bring those together.
