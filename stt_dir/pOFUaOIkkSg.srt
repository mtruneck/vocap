Belief in evolution is nothing more than a
gut feeling, the National Center for

Science Eradication supports teaching
more bad science in the classroom, and


3
0:0:9,83 --> 0:0:13,92
of course, we read viewer feedback.  This
is still one of the most talked about shows

And a welcome to this episode of Genesis
Week, the weekly program of creationary


7
0:0:37,38 --> 0:0:41,2
commentary on news, views and events
pertaining to the origins controversy,


8
0:0:41,2 --> 0:0:46,5
exclusive right here on youtube.  Once
again in the top ten most talked about


9
0:0:46,5 --> 0:0:50,7
videos in Science and Technology on
youtube, we bring you the information the


10
0:0:50,7 --> 0:0:54,69
anti-creationists don't want you to see or

I'm your host, Ian Juby


14
0:1:9,44 --> 0:1:14,55
A live science article carried the bold and
revealing headline: "Belief in Evolution


15
0:1:14,55 --> 0:1:21,59
Boils Down to a Gut Feeling."  Now I must
first make a disclaimer: The vast majority


16
0:1:21,59 --> 0:1:25,31
of people I have met who are of
evolutionary persuasion, are good,


17
0:1:25,31 --> 0:1:29,61
honest people who simply have never
heard any of the overwhelming evidence


18
0:1:29,61 --> 0:1:35,39
refuting evolution and affirming creation -
after all, evolution has an army of judges,


19
0:1:35,39 --> 0:1:39,69
lawyers and school policies to hide
behind and thus protect the masses from


20
0:1:39,69 --> 0:1:45,33
those inconvenient facts.  Thus the reason
for this program, to educate people on


21
0:1:45,33 --> 0:1:49,79
what they haven't been told.
Dealing with this subject regularly, I of


22
0:1:49,79 --> 0:1:53,93
course run into many people who
religiously cling to evolution in spite of


23
0:1:53,93 --> 0:1:59,5
the facts, not because of them.  And so
the live science article is an especially


24
0:1:59,5 --> 0:2:1,68
interesting read.


25
0:2:1,68 --> 0:2:6,7
The live Science team was reporting on
an article by Minsu Ha, et al., in the


26
0:2:6,7 --> 0:2:11,6
Journal of Research in Science Teaching,
available on line for free


27
0:2:11,6 --> 0:2:17,6
After waxing eloquently on how central
and important evolution is to biology, the


28
0:2:17,6 --> 0:2:30,78
authors lament the fact that:


29
0:2:30,78 --> 0:2:34,97
In what has to be the ultimate irony, the
authors never stop to ask questions like


30
0:2:34,97 --> 0:2:39,24
"Do these people who understand
biology, perhaps have a good scientific


31
0:2:39,24 --> 0:2:45,27
reason to reject evolution?"  Ohhh, no, no,
no, no, no! Instead, they go on to propose


32
0:2:45,27 --> 0:2:50,96
that people who accept or reject evolution
do it based on... gut feelings.  The


33
0:2:50,96 --> 0:2:55,49
researchers never stop to consider their
own psychological projection, that they


34
0:2:55,49 --> 0:3:0,77
themselves are believing evolution strictly
because their gut tells them so, and not


35
0:3:0,77 --> 0:3:3,21
because of any scientific fact.


36
0:3:3,21 --> 0:3:7,42
I have some news for you folks:  There are
numerous lines of scientific evidence


37
0:3:7,42 --> 0:3:12,73
which refute evolution, and in fact, the
evidence from biology is some of the


38
0:3:12,73 --> 0:3:16,17
most powerful evidence refuting
evolution, hence the reason many


39
0:3:16,17 --> 0:3:21,94
biologists reject evolution as the only
explanation for life and its diversity.  You


40
0:3:21,94 --> 0:3:27,4
know, people like geneticists Dr. Kevin
Anderson, Dr. Jean Lightner and Dr.


41
0:3:27,4 --> 0:3:31,15
Jonathan Sanford - co-inventor of the
gene gun.  Or Dr. Jerry Bergman who


42
0:3:31,15 --> 0:3:36,9
holds nine degrees, two of them Phd's.
The good scientific reasons from biology


43
0:3:36,9 --> 0:3:41,37
that refute evolution and instead point to
a Creator are too many to list, but some


44
0:3:41,37 --> 0:3:45,39
examples are the origin of life,
codependency of systems within life,


45
0:3:45,39 --> 0:3:49,82
genetic entropy, irreducible complexity,
the lack of biological mechanisms to


46
0:3:49,82 --> 0:3:53,94
produce new, useful genetic information,
etc., etc...


47
0:3:53,94 --> 0:3:59,8
Never considering even once that
evolutionary theory could possibly have


48
0:3:59,8 --> 0:4:4,39
problems or - heaven forbid - be WRONG,
the authors make an interesting


49
0:4:4,39 --> 0:4:19,83
comment:


50
0:4:19,83 --> 0:4:24,9
Translation: Meh. We don't have the facts
to convince them, we just need to focus


51
0:4:24,9 --> 0:4:28,24
on putting on a convincing show.


52
0:4:28,24 --> 0:4:32,36
The National Center for Science
Eradication has decided to take on global


53
0:4:32,36 --> 0:4:36,58
warming, now called "climate change"
because global warming was so


54
0:4:36,58 --> 0:4:41,42
thoroughly refuted it's gotten a bad name.
Comparing global warming to creationism,


55
0:4:41,42 --> 0:4:46,71
the NCSE has decided to take on this
battle in the schools.  Basically, teachers


56
0:4:46,71 --> 0:4:51,7
in schools are feeling pressured to teach
the controversy (in other words, teach the


57
0:4:51,7 --> 0:4:56,94
facts) of alleged "global warming,"
specifically the connection between


58
0:4:56,94 --> 0:5:1,75
human activity and global warming.  This
is not difficult to discredit. We had an ice


59
0:5:1,75 --> 0:5:7,29
age, we are no longer in an  ice age, and
the recession of the ice age had nothing


60
0:5:7,29 --> 0:5:12,93
to do with human activity.  One good
volcano emits more "greenhouse gasses"


61
0:5:12,93 --> 0:5:17,98
than the entire industrial world does in a
year. The correlation between sunspot


62
0:5:17,98 --> 0:5:21,73
activity and global temperatures is
staggering, and let us not forget the huge


63
0:5:21,73 --> 0:5:26,8
methane beds buried in the continental
shelves around the world, which contain


64
0:5:26,8 --> 0:5:31,61
waaaay more methane than all of the cow
flatulations that McDonald's can produce.


65
0:5:31,61 --> 0:5:37,27
So it's to be expected that the NCSE
would stand up for bankrupt "science"


66
0:5:37,27 --> 0:5:40,72
and help defend teachers against those
who would like to see our children


67
0:5:40,72 --> 0:5:44,62
educated with actual facts instead of
propaganda.


68
0:5:44,62 --> 0:5:50,13
It's interesting to note that the NCSE is a
private organization, funded by private


69
0:5:50,13 --> 0:5:55,4
individuals with unknown motives and
intentions. The NCSE has publically


70
0:5:55,4 --> 0:6:0,63
supported open, flagrant bigotry in
academia towards anyone who dares


71
0:6:0,63 --> 0:6:4,69
question evolution, and has spearheaded
most of the legal wranglings in a


72
0:6:4,69 --> 0:6:9,54
desperate attempt to protect evolution
from scientific scrutiny in our education


73
0:6:9,54 --> 0:6:14,17
system.  This group has always targeted
schools, and specifically aimed their guns


74
0:6:14,17 --> 0:6:20,72
at propagandizing your children.  Although
they have "science" and "education" in


75
0:6:20,72 --> 0:6:26,14
their name, it's akin to the so-named
"Planned parenthood" - an organization


76
0:6:26,14 --> 0:6:28,83
which has nothing to do with planning, or
parenthood!


77
0:6:28,83 --> 0:6:34,89
It is clear that the NCSE's actions are
anti-science, and anti-education.  Real


78
0:6:34,89 --> 0:6:39,21
scientists don't seek court protection and
mandate for their theories to be taught in


79
0:6:39,21 --> 0:6:46,5
our schools, and real science welcomes
scrutiny.  I welcome scrutiny in everything


80
0:6:46,5 --> 0:6:50,74
I say, because I'm not afraid of the truth
and the facts.  Why does the NCSE so


81
0:6:50,74 --> 0:6:54,56
venomously fight scrutiny? Hmmmm?


82
0:6:54,56 --> 0:7:0,42
It's finally here, and the wait has been
worth it.  For those of you who caught my


83
0:7:0,42 --> 0:7:3,88
good friend Spike Psarris's volume 1 of
"What you aren't being told about


84
0:7:3,88 --> 0:7:8,12
astronomy", he has just released volume
2.  It was more of the fantastic


85
0:7:8,12 --> 0:7:12,93
drinking-from-the-firehose information,
revealing God's astounding handiwork,


86
0:7:12,93 --> 0:7:16,29
showing why there has to be a Creator,
and that the Creator of the Bible is the


87
0:7:16,29 --> 0:7:20,93
most likely culprit.  Many of those in the
anti-creation community went into major


88
0:7:20,93 --> 0:7:26,0
"damage control mode" when Spike's first
video came out - criticizing Spike


89
0:7:26,0 --> 0:7:30,4
personally on blogs and on youtube, while
never addressing the scientific points he


90
0:7:30,4 --> 0:7:35,69
made, or worse - trying to respond to his
points and making a bigger mess for the


91
0:7:35,69 --> 0:7:40,66
evolution of the solar system.  In his latest
video, he takes on the origin of stars and


92
0:7:40,66 --> 0:7:44,75
galaxies. One of the many points he
makes is showing how every secular


93
0:7:44,75 --> 0:7:50,33
theory on the origin of stars and
galaxies....requires pre-existing stars.


94
0:7:50,33 --> 0:7:55,47
This video is only a few more nails in the
coffin of the evolution of the astronomical


95
0:7:55,47 --> 0:8:0,12
bodies, and you can get your own copy
from creationastronomy.com, for a


96
0:8:0,12 --> 0:8:3,9
measely fifteen bucks. I highly
recommend the video, and am so looking


97
0:8:3,9 --> 0:8:6,9
forward to volume III.


98
0:8:6,9 --> 0:8:10,95
Homeschoolers: Carey Jane Clark has a
homeschool blog and is now holding a


99
0:8:10,95 --> 0:8:16,96
"Think about it Thursday", starting   today,
where she has a segment devoted to


100
0:8:16,96 --> 0:8:21,1
creation and homeschooling.  I'll be the
guest writer on the blog, and we'll attempt


101
0:8:21,1 --> 0:8:24,88
to address common questions home
schoolers may have.  Here's the link to her


102
0:8:24,88 --> 0:8:29,58
website.


103
0:8:29,58 --> 0:8:34,67
[scary, dramatic music]


104
0:8:34,67 --> 0:8:37,27
Wahoo! Mail for me?


105
0:8:37,27 --> 0:8:41,87
[scary, dramatic music]


106
0:8:41,87 --> 0:8:46,56
I was again impressed with the comments
of CircusOfPrecision on youtube, who


107
0:8:46,56 --> 0:8:50,5
posted dozens of very enlightening
comments - which were met by a barrage


108
0:8:50,5 --> 0:8:54,87
of willfully blind individuals.  Too many
comments to repeat here, I'll simply


109
0:8:54,87 --> 0:8:59,7
encourage viewers to take a look, and I
commend CircusOfPrecision - who


110
0:8:59,7 --> 0:9:2,51
apparently is not a young earth
creationist.  I can only commend you for


111
0:9:2,51 --> 0:9:7,63
your diligence in educating those who do
not want to be educated, and will simply


112
0:9:7,63 --> 0:9:12,12
remind you that you are being read by
many others who are not commenting,


113
0:9:12,12 --> 0:9:17,21
but are paying close attention to how you
have thoroughly and fearlessly decimated


114
0:9:17,21 --> 0:9:22,82
those who propone falsehoods.  Precision,
for your valiant efforts in the intellectual


115
0:9:22,82 --> 0:9:26,55
battle - particularly against those who
seem to have come to an intellectual


116
0:9:26,55 --> 0:9:33,87
battle unarmed, I salute you!  I'd buy you a
Tim Horton's coffee, cause I'm sure your


117
0:9:33,87 --> 0:9:37,57
head must hurt after the barrage of
non-sequitors and bad science that's


118
0:9:37,57 --> 0:10:0,72
been hurled at you.


119
0:10:0,72 --> 0:10:5,94
That was just such an excellent question
Johnbgroovy - thank you for writing in.


120
0:10:5,94 --> 0:10:11,82
You are quite correct - an intelligent
designer is a vague concept - we need to


121
0:10:11,82 --> 0:10:18,51
ask the question, if there is an intelligent
designer, then who is that designer?  and


122
0:10:18,51 --> 0:10:23,81
how would you know?  Jesus claimed to
be the Creator, but hey - I've had people


123
0:10:23,81 --> 0:10:27,97
tell me they were God.  Just because
someone claims they're God doesn't


124
0:10:27,97 --> 0:10:31,39
mean they're God.  So when someone
comes up to you and claims they're God -


125
0:10:31,39 --> 0:10:35,6
what's the first thing that comes out of
your mouth?  I don't know about you, the


126
0:10:35,6 --> 0:10:41,46
first thing I said was "Oh ya? Prove it!"
Let's prove Christ is God.  He proved it


127
0:10:41,46 --> 0:10:46,61
with so many miracles that even his
enemies didn't deny them - including the


128
0:10:46,61 --> 0:10:50,99
miracle of rising from the dead.  Stalin
didn't do this, nor did Buddha, 


129
0:10:50,99 --> 0:10:55,31
nor did the flying spaghetti monster.
Islamics even specifically state that


130
0:10:55,31 --> 0:10:59,77
Mohammed did not do any miracles, and I
actually agree with them when they say


131
0:10:59,77 --> 0:11:4,8
they does not mean he was not a genuine
prophet. After all, the Bible referred to


132
0:11:4,8 --> 0:11:9,83
John the Baptist as the greatest prophet
ever, and yet he did no miracle.  Rather,


133
0:11:9,83 --> 0:11:15,77
the question here is, will the real and true
Creator God please stand up? Jesus did


134
0:11:15,77 --> 0:11:21,95
countless miracles -but hey - Chris Angel
does "miracles" all the time, perhaps


135
0:11:21,95 --> 0:11:27,0
Jesus was just a really good magician?  As
a further sign that He was who He said He


136
0:11:27,0 --> 0:11:31,57
was, we have books written thousands of
years before His arrival that made over


137
0:11:31,57 --> 0:11:39,3
400 specific prophecies about Christ -
that were all fufilled in Christ.  God told


138
0:11:39,3 --> 0:11:43,4
the people of earth He was going to come
to earth as a human, to redeem us.


139
0:11:43,4 --> 0:11:59,16
Basically He said "You will know it's me
because I will do this, this, this, this,


140
0:11:59,16 --> 0:12:2,99
........"
He fulfilled those prophecies, including


141
0:12:2,99 --> 0:12:8,13
where he would be born, where He would
die, HOW He would die, that none of His


142
0:12:8,13 --> 0:12:11,51
bones would be broken, that He would be
betrayed by a friend, and for how many


143
0:12:11,51 --> 0:12:15,52
pieces of silver He would be betrayed.
Finally, that He would rise again from the


144
0:12:15,52 --> 0:12:22,8
dead.  No one else has ever done this.
That is how you know who the Creator is,


145
0:12:22,8 --> 0:12:26,75
and this Creator rose from the dead to
show us He is the way, the TRUTH, and


146
0:12:26,75 --> 0:12:28,99
the LIFE.


147
0:12:28,99 --> 0:12:43,85
The Science Foundation said this:


148
0:12:43,85 --> 0:12:50,46
Oh yes - you're right, the coelacanth has
changed in one way: its name.....which


149
0:12:50,46 --> 0:12:53,16
was assigned by evolutionists who want
to make them out to be as different as


150
0:12:53,16 --> 0:12:58,86
possible.  We have more variation in dogs
than we do in the fossil and living


151
0:12:58,86 --> 0:13:4,54
coelacanths.  So the only change that has
happened, is in the name.  We see this in


152
0:13:4,54 --> 0:13:9,59
multiple cases, such as the herring. The
fossil form is called Knightia, the modern,


153
0:13:9,59 --> 0:13:14,47
living version which is identical in every
respect, is called Clupea.  The only


154
0:13:14,47 --> 0:13:18,15
evolutionary change evident, is in the
name.


155
0:13:18,15 --> 0:13:31,97
Orge121 had a couple of interesting
comments:


156
0:13:31,97 --> 0:13:35,9
Well, I didn't think NephilimFree was a
ranting idiot, but thank you for writing,


157
0:13:35,9 --> 0:13:40,1
and you know what? I don't mind
someone disagreeing with me, or saying


158
0:13:40,1 --> 0:13:44,58
I'm wrong.  After all, I am only human, I
can make mistakes too, and I would like to


159
0:13:44,58 --> 0:13:49,12
be corrected if I am in error. You'll
understand I typically ignore most replies


160
0:13:49,12 --> 0:13:52,89
as they aren't even worth paying attention
to. They are simply assertions,


161
0:13:52,89 --> 0:13:56,92
accusations, insults and red herrings
having nothing to do with whether or not


162
0:13:56,92 --> 0:14:1,14
I'm right.  So I appreciate your demeanor,
thank you.  You also made a further,


163
0:14:1,14 --> 0:14:28,47
interesting comment worthy of a
response:


164
0:14:28,47 --> 0:14:34,33
I agree with your fossilization statement -
in fact, that was exactly my point: The


165
0:14:34,33 --> 0:14:38,91
absence of a fossil in a rock layer does
not mean it was not present when the


166
0:14:38,91 --> 0:14:44,37
layer was formed.  In other words, not
finding a fossil fish in, say, the Cambrian


167
0:14:44,37 --> 0:14:49,6
does not necessarily mean that fish was
not there during the Cambrian.


168
0:14:49,6 --> 0:14:53,69
Consequently, you cannot build an
evolutionary sequence based on any


169
0:14:53,69 --> 0:14:57,53
supposed order of fossils appearing in
the rock record.  As for whales not


170
0:14:57,53 --> 0:15:1,96
hanging out in coastal areas, well, the
entire whale watching industry is built


171
0:15:1,96 --> 0:15:5,26
upon coastal whale watching. When I
went whale watching in Cape Breton, we


172
0:15:5,26 --> 0:15:8,94
were never more than about a mile and a
half from the coast! In fact, I don't think it


173
0:15:8,94 --> 0:15:53,9
was even that far!  But thank you for
writing in.


174
0:15:53,9 --> 0:15:58,73
Yes, I did say that.  Look at the gene pool:
You had more variation in the bacterial


175
0:15:58,73 --> 0:16:3,6
gene pool before the exposure to the
antibiotics, which wiped out a huge


176
0:16:3,6 --> 0:16:8,3
portion of the population, leaving behind
bacteria - which already existed - 


177
0:16:8,3 --> 0:16:13,92
but now with less variation in their
genome. In other words, less information


178
0:16:13,92 --> 0:16:18,94
in their genomes - genetic information
was wiped out - lost. This is reverse


179
0:16:18,94 --> 0:16:41,9
evolution.


180
0:16:41,9 --> 0:16:46,26
Yes, that would be the famous "Lucy"
skeleton.  If the evidence doesn't fit, make


181
0:16:46,26 --> 0:17:26,46
it fit.  I covered this in Complete Creation,
part 16.


182
0:17:26,46 --> 0:17:30,2
Indeed!  If you haven't figured it out
already, Teno is one of those people who


183
0:17:30,2 --> 0:17:34,61
knows Joe Taylor personally.
And yes, even though I have shown


184
0:17:34,61 --> 0:17:40,3
numerous lines of scientific evidence that
supports the paluxy tracks, lawilsom still


185
0:17:40,3 --> 0:17:46,72
chooses to assert - with no evidence
whatsoever - that they are all fakes.  Ya,


186
0:17:46,72 --> 0:17:49,69
somebody carved human footprints
underneath 18 inches of undisturbed


187
0:17:49,69 --> 0:17:54,72
limestone. I'm one of the guys who has
helped break up that rock to expose


188
0:17:54,72 --> 0:17:59,83
tracks, in front of multiple eye witnesses,
on more than one occassion - it's hard


189
0:17:59,83 --> 0:18:6,42
work!  In fact, public excavations are held
ever year in the Paluxy riverbed by the


190
0:18:6,42 --> 0:18:10,39
Creation Evidence Museum - it's been
going on for years.  There has literally


191
0:18:10,39 --> 0:18:14,48
been hundreds of eye witnesses who will
attest to the human footprints uncovered


192
0:18:14,48 --> 0:18:15,66
there.


193
0:18:15,66 --> 0:18:19,22
SwordOfTheSpiritUK immediately
recognized the issue of human and


194
0:18:19,22 --> 0:18:23,9
dinosaur footprints found together, and
its relation to the age of the earth. While


195
0:18:23,9 --> 0:18:27,63
he is an old-earth creationist, his
comments and analysis has been very


196
0:18:27,63 --> 0:18:33,36
interesting, and he's been documenting
his intellectual journey on his blog.  He


197
0:18:33,36 --> 0:18:37,17
certainly has not let me get away with
anything, and has been a faithful skeptic.


198
0:18:37,17 --> 0:18:40,51
I look forward to following his journey.


199
0:18:40,51 --> 0:18:43,94
Well that's enough for this week - thanks
to everyone who wrote in, agreeing or


200
0:18:43,94 --> 0:18:47,48
disagreeing, and thanks for watching.
Remember how easy it is to share this


201
0:18:47,48 --> 0:18:51,78
program with your friends by clicking the
convenient "share" button, down below.


202
0:18:51,78 --> 0:18:55,74
I'm your host Ian Juby, signing off for
now and reminding you that Jesus said I


203
0:18:55,74 --> 0:19:0,36
am the way, the truth and the life - no
man comes to the father but through me.


204
0:19:0,36 --> 0:19:2,48
We'll see you next Thursday.


205
0:19:2,48 --> 0:19:6,45
Production Software was provided for
Genesis Week by the Big Valley Creation


206
0:19:6,45 --> 0:19:11,44
Science Museum, located just 25 minutes
north of Drumheller, Alberta. In the heart


207
0:19:11,44 --> 0:19:15,28
of the dinosaur badlands, the Big Valley
Creation Science Museum was built from


208
0:19:15,28 --> 0:19:19,6
the ground up to give credit to our
Creator, portraying the scientific evidence


209
0:19:19,6 --> 0:19:24,68
showing that creation is the faith that fits
the facts, and that evolution is the faith


210
0:19:24,68 --> 0:21:24,68
that the facts have failed.
