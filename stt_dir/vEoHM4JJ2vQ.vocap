###2 HARRY CHEADLE: Well, hello.
###3 I'm Harry, and I'm a loser.
###5 Growing up, I was one of those weird kids who would play by
###8 the dumpsters at recess and ride the school bus by myself.
###11 But now I live in Brooklyn.
###13 I have a real job at a real magazine.
###14 I have a bank account and a bunch of shirts.
###17 So I figure I can go back, revisit some of my failures,
###20 and, with a little bit of luck,
###21 turn them into successes.
###23 This is "All Around Losing" with Harry Cheadle.
###24 
###28 You know how every youth soccer team has that one weird
###31 kid who just kind of stands off by himself and lets the
###33 ball go right past him?
###34 My whole team was those guys.
###36 There were a couple guys named Carl.
###38 Prithvi, Prithvi Shankar.
###39 We could have won a math championship with all the
###41 brains we had on my team, but, running around, not so much.
###46 And I was part of the problem.
###47 In six years playing, I scored exactly one goal, got hit in
###51 the nuts with a soccer ball more times than I can count.
###53 Sometimes it would hit me in the face.
###54 I feel kind of responsible for a lot of the bad seasons we
###58 had, including the last one, where we didn't
###60 win a single game.
###63 Now I've got a little bit more self-confidence, better
###66 foot-eye coordination, so maybe there's a chance I will
###69 actually be an all right soccer player.
###72 But in order to not embarrass myself, I'm going to need some
###74 coaching from an Austrian named Gerhard.
###76 HARRY CHEADLE: Hey, Gerhard.
###77 GERHARD STOCHL: Hey.
###77 How are you?
###78 HARRY CHEADLE: I'm good.
###78 So the deal is, I'm trying to get back into soccer.
###81 I haven't played in like seven years.
###83 All I want to do is impress people.
###84 GERHARD STOCHL: That exactly.
###85 HARRY CHEADLE: I don't really care about--
###86 GERHARD STOCHL: Because otherwise it
###87 will take 10 years.
###88 How long we got?
###88 A week?
###90 HARRY CHEADLE: Like a day.
###93 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###139 GERHARD STOCHL: I think you did good.
###140 HARRY CHEADLE: Yeah?
###141 GERHARD STOCHL: You got the juggling.
###143 HARRY CHEADLE: I kind of like juggling.
###144 GERHARD STOCHL: Goalkeeping.
###145 Good penalties.
###146 Maybe a few push ups and--
###148 tonight, before the game.
###150 HARRY CHEADLE: OK.
###151 GERHARD STOCHL: And you're ready.
###154 HARRY CHEADLE: I'm feeling pretty nervous about this.
###156 I sat on my glasses this morning when I woke up.
###159 My arm hurts for no reason.
###160 It's pretty cold.
###163 Practice with Gerhard went OK, but actually playing a game is
###166 a lot different than just kicking a ball around.
###169 So, these guys are probably going to be a lot better than
###172 me, and I'll try not to embarrass myself,
###173 but I always do.
###176 The first person I met was Minh.
###178 Hey, Minh.
###180 Sort of an unofficial coach or referee, or at least the guy
###183 who brings the jerseys.
###185 The other guys are really friendly.
###187 I'm--
###187 MALE SPEAKER: Are those your special soccer shoes?
###189 HARRY CHEADLE: They seem supportive of my
###190 weird little mission.
###193 Wherever I can do the least damage.
###194 MALE SPEAKER: Defense.
###195 HARRY CHEADLE: Defense?
###195 Yeah.
###196 And then, all of a sudden, I was playing soccer.
###198 I've got no idea what I'm doing here.
###199 I just was trying to follow my man around a little bit and
###202 couldn't do that.
###203 Oh, that was probably my fault.
###205 Sometimes I saw where I was supposed to be way too late.
###208 Oh shit!
###209 Sometimes I'd get the ball, purely by chance--
###212 it would just deflect off of someone's foot-- and
###213 I had to kick it.
###214 And that was just totally impossible.
###218 Oh shit!
###221 Not very well.
###224 A little winded.
###226 [INAUDIBLE]?
###226 Yeah.
###227 Yeah, sure.
###228 
###232 It's tough to run around.
###232 I haven't run around like that in a long time.
###235 No one was making fun of me for being really bad.
###237 
###239 Although I could tell they didn't want to pass it to me.
###241 
###247 I don't really know how this works, but I'm too intimidated
###249 to ask questions.
###250 
###255 Actually, the hard part was running for half an hour, or
###258 45 minutes, or two days, or whatever it was.
###261 Because I'm in really, really bad shape, I realized.
###265 I've got to sit down, actually.
###268 I was feeling pretty bad.
###272 I just met all these people.
###273 And my rule is don't throw up in front of people
###276 you've just met, ever.
###279 And then a black guy started talking, but I was also trying
###282 really hard not to throw up at that point.
###284 MALE SPEAKER: How long you haven't played?
###286 HARRY CHEADLE: Years.
###287 MALE SPEAKER: Really?
###288 HARRY CHEADLE: And then your body's like, nope.
###290 This is coming up.
###291 
###295 And I was like, oh, shit.
###297 I was trying not to puke on anyone's bag.
###299 I succeeded in that, at least.
###301 I know how to puke probably better than I
###303 know how to play soccer.
###304 MALE SPEAKER: That's a good thing.
###304 HARRY CHEADLE: What?
###305 MALE SPEAKER: Once all that's out, you're
###307 going to play better.
###308 HARRY CHEADLE: Oh, shit.
###309 And then I puked again.
###310 
###313 HARRY CHEADLE: Jesus.
###314 
###320 That's how my life usually goes.
###322 I gave the guys some orange slices, and I hope that kind
###325 of patched things up.
###326 I was like, here, not only did I puke, but I brought you some
###329 vitamin C.
###330 Nothing like a good orange slice, right?
###332 And I kept playing, at least.
###333 I'm glad I didn't bitch out.
###335 I did try to bitch out.
###336 MINH NGO: You only played what?
###337 30 minutes?
###339 HARRY CHEADLE: I'm really out of shape.
###340 MINH NGO: You have one more game in you.
###341 HARRY CHEADLE: All right.
###341 One more.
###342 Even though I was bad, and I had just thrown up, Minh was
###345 like, come on, get in there and play.
###346 And that was nice.
###349 During the last play of that game, no one was paying
###352 attention to me--
###354 probably for good reason.
###355 I got the ball, and I'm looking at the goal, and I
###359 kicked the ball pretty hard--
###361 
###364 Sorry.
###365 
###367 It went right to the goalie, but it was a shot on goal.
###370 MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE], just nail it in.
###372 HARRY CHEADLE: I probably would have thrown up again if
###374 I had made that goal.
###376 I think this situation was about a 70% failure, mostly
###381 because of the puking.
###383 Honestly, you don't feel good when you puke in front of
###385 other people.
###386 I've lost this one.
###387 Just like I lost the ones when I was a kid.
###389 Same feeling.
###390 Keep looking.
###391 Keep looking for redemption.
###392 And I guess that's what I'm going to do.
###394 
###398 It wasn't that bad out there, though.
###400 Maybe I could--
###401 if I practiced--
###402 get a little better at soccer, I think.
###404 But I'm not sure I will because, honestly, I remember
###407 all those times, my favorite part of the soccer game was
###409 when it's over.
###411 And you're in the car, and you get to go home and take your
###413 shin guards off.
###415 So that's what I enjoyed most about it, was stopping it.
###419 Is that good?
###420 MALE SPEAKER: No.
###421 Keep going.
