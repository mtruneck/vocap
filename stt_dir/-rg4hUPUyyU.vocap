###77 Tallis and me wagered on who would get to you first,
###81 us or the mage.
###95 What?
###97 I was just thinking about our deal...
###100 The Chantry wants Saarebas alive, but you intend to kill him.
###104 That is, if you win our duel.
###111 You were never intending on going back.
###114 When I left Kirkwall, I knew there was no going back.
###117 I have no regrets.
###119 The mage deserves to die. You know that as well as I do.
###125 Doesn't matter what I know.
###127 The Qunari want him back alive. That's my mission.
###132 I can't mess up again.
###134 Sooner or later you will disobey another order.
###137 You can't change who you are.
###140 Then they'll do more than demote you.
###145 Show me an alternative.
###148 Free yourself.
###150 As I have done.
###154 Are you suggesting that we run off together?
###156 That I become Tal-Vashoth?
###159 What's Tal-Vashoth?
###160 One who abandons the Qun. An exile, forever outcast.
###166 From what I've seen, that's exactly what you are.
###170 You said it yourself...
###172 We're both renegades.
###176 I suppose...
###177 Although we see the pit, we cannot avoid it.
###185 What are you doing?
###187 Falling into the pit.
###200 Hey, boy, see that?
###205 I like to blow off a bit of steam too, just before battle.
###209 You up for it?
###212 No!
###214 I'm betrothed to Fina. Have you not been listening?
###217 You're going to get torn up by a demon army soon enough!
###220 You done it before, right?
###222 No. Never!
###227 Then get here and practice, for Fina's sake!
###232 Hey, you two!
###234 Over here!
###248 [Saarebas] At last!
###253 Fina!
###258 Josmael and I will sneak around the back, closest to the altar.
###261 Get the girl out before attacking.
###263 Really?
###265 But your mission...
###266 Will get done one way or another.
###269 I can't be all Qunari after all...
###272 No use denying it.
###289 Move! Let's go!
###291 For the first time in my life, I am not the weapon, I wield it.
###304 Fina! Fina!
###311 Saarebas, they're here!
###313 What?
###332 What more appropriate audience for a night of death and destruction.
###344 Go on Templar, I got this!
###353 I think not, Saarebas!
###360 Love, why did you warn them?
###363 All I've ever been was the girl you were to marry.
###365 I wasn't special until Saarebas captured me!
###370 A little blood...
###373 ...for a lot of power!
###384 Fina...
###413 My sister!
###416 No!!!!
###421 Fen'Harel...
###423 Thank thee for thy wondrous tools!
###434 I owe you thanks, Templar.
###437 Such freedom you've given me.
###440 A gift for killing your family, perhaps.
###444 You will bait me no longer, mage!
###447 You may take my family, but my future will be my own!
###461 [Nyree] Nice one!
###470 Tallis!
###473 Stop the blood!
###485 You...
###494 Tallis!
###496 [Screams]
###506 Cairn...
###507 Cairn!
###508 Cairn! Cairn! Josmael, come quick, heal him!
###512 Heal him!
###514 There's no healing that, lovey.
###517 But...
###519 ...our duel.
###523 [Saarebas laughs]
###526 Well, this has been an amusing respite.
###531 You serve your title well, elf.
###534 Tallis true.
###538 Why?
###539 Why this? Why not just escape and live your life?
###544 I had the means to do harm, so I took it.
###548 It was almost... involuntary.
###552 How could I deny my function?
###556 The Qunari made me this way.
###560 As they have made you.
###563 You're right...
###566 No matter how hard we fight it, eventually we follow our true nature.
###572 You can't be faulted for that.
###577 And neither can I.
###581 This is for Cairn!
###594 Here...
###597 Don't force it.
###599 You got to dig down a bit.
###601 Here...
###609 I'm going to walk the lad back to his people.
###611 It's along my way. I'm heading back to Nevarra myself.
###615 Get myself clear of the blasted law.
###621 The balance.
###626 Doesn't feel much like a victory, huh?
###629 Not really.
###634 I thought you might want this...
###638 To remember.
###642 Thank you.
###648 Goodbye Josmael.
###650 One day you'll make a fine Keeper!
###653 Not one day...
###655 I am the Keeper. I know my duty.
###659 Thank you, Tallis.
###662 Your Qunari gonna be right peeved with you not showing up with the mage.
###666 There's a smart move, just lay it all on the Templar.
###669 No!
###671 I'll finish my mission my way.
###674 Right, renegade.
###677 Who knows? Next time you see me I might not be Tallis anymore.
###684 I could be Tal-Vashoth.
###704 Past the idea of right and wrong, there is a field.
###707 When a soul lies down in that grass, the world is in balance.
###713 I will meet you there.
