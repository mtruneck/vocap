0:0:26,9 --> 0:0:28,14
TOM SACHS: My name
is Tom Sachs.


4
0:0:28,14 --> 0:0:29,88
I'm 45 years old.


5
0:0:29,88 --> 0:0:32,31
This is my Space Program.


6
0:0:32,31 --> 0:0:36,42
Scientists will be analyzing
Mars soil samples, determining


7
0:0:36,42 --> 0:0:38,94
whether it's safe to inseminate
the Mars surface.


8
0:0:38,94 --> 0:0:51,18



9
0:0:51,18 --> 0:0:56,35
VAN NEISTAT: The same energy and
the same skill that NASA,


10
0:0:56,35 --> 0:1:0,79
the other NASA, used to get
their people to the moon, we


11
0:1:0,79 --> 0:1:2,4
are using here.


12
0:1:2,4 --> 0:1:4,129
And we're using all the money
we can get our hands on.


13
0:1:4,129 --> 0:1:8,69
We're using all the hours we can
get out of ourselves, all


14
0:1:8,69 --> 0:1:11,35
of our brain power, all
of the research, to


15
0:1:11,35 --> 0:1:12,56
accomplish this mission.


16
0:1:12,56 --> 0:1:16,92
And in that respect, we
are going to Mars.


17
0:1:16,92 --> 0:1:18,42
LT SAM RATANARAT: There's a
real buzz in the studio.


18
0:1:18,42 --> 0:1:20,105
And everyone's always working
on something different.


19
0:1:20,105 --> 0:1:22,5
And if people are helping each
other, and there's always


20
0:1:22,5 --> 0:1:24,16
people coming in for
studio visits.


21
0:1:24,16 --> 0:1:25,41
And it's just kind of--


22
0:1:25,41 --> 0:1:27,24
it's really alive, and
it's really great.


23
0:1:27,24 --> 0:1:29,463
It's the best job
I've ever had.


24
0:1:29,463 --> 0:1:37,135
[MUSIC PLAYING]


25
0:1:37,135 --> 0:1:39,0
TOM SACHS: The space program
ended in October with the


26
0:1:39,0 --> 0:1:40,68
closure of the shuttle
program.


27
0:1:40,68 --> 0:1:46,9
It's clear that companies like
SpaceX, Elon Musk's private


28
0:1:46,9 --> 0:1:50,21
thing, or Richard Branson or
the Google guys, everyone's


29
0:1:50,21 --> 0:1:52,23
got their own space
program now.


30
0:1:52,23 --> 0:1:55,29
And that's where
the money's at.


31
0:1:55,29 --> 0:2:0,405
And I think that my space
program has as much teeth as


32
0:2:0,405 --> 0:2:2,963
theirs do because mine wins
hearts and minds.


33
0:2:2,963 --> 0:2:17,26
[MUSIC PLAYING]


34
0:2:17,26 --> 0:2:20,99
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Three,
two, one, main engine


35
0:2:20,99 --> 0:2:27,1
start, zero, and lift off of
the Atlas V with Curiosity,


36
0:2:27,1 --> 0:2:31,79
seeking clues to the planetary
puzzle about life on Mars.


37
0:2:31,79 --> 0:2:36,41
TOM SACHS: The Mars Science
Laboratory, MSL, Curiosity's


38
0:2:36,41 --> 0:2:40,3
landing on Mars on August 4
is the greatest scientific


39
0:2:40,3 --> 0:2:41,55
machine we've ever created.


40
0:2:41,55 --> 0:2:47,61
It's a fantastic rover that
has a mass spectroscopy


41
0:2:47,61 --> 0:2:49,87
machine, laser emulation,
great cameras.


42
0:2:49,87 --> 0:2:52,58
And a rover, it runs on like
a nuclear-power battery.


43
0:2:52,58 --> 0:2:53,51
It's the most miraculous
thing.


44
0:2:53,51 --> 0:2:56,6
But you might not even
know about it.


45
0:2:56,6 --> 0:2:58,77
And your viewers might not
know about it because it


46
0:2:58,77 --> 0:3:0,46
doesn't have any people on it.


47
0:3:0,46 --> 0:3:6,1
And, as sexual, reproducing
beings, it's important that we


48
0:3:6,1 --> 0:3:9,8
go to other planets to
encourage people.


49
0:3:9,8 --> 0:3:12,0
I mean, when Neil Armstrong
stepped on the moon, you


50
0:3:12,0 --> 0:3:13,83
imagined yourself
in his shoes.


51
0:3:13,83 --> 0:3:16,66
When that robot does laser
emulation, it's really hard


52
0:3:16,66 --> 0:3:18,8
for you to even imagine
what that idea is.


53
0:3:18,8 --> 0:3:21,69



54
0:3:21,69 --> 0:3:23,22
I think we have to go to Mars.


55
0:3:23,22 --> 0:3:28,41
It's an important place to go
from a scientific perspective.


56
0:3:28,41 --> 0:3:31,79
If you want to look at
the big question--


57
0:3:31,79 --> 0:3:33,16
where did we come from?


58
0:3:33,16 --> 0:3:37,515
Mars has evidence of that there
used to be water there.


59
0:3:37,515 --> 0:3:41,6
If you took one semester of
sedimentology in college, you


60
0:3:41,6 --> 0:3:43,64
will believe that water was
there, if you just study the


61
0:3:43,64 --> 0:3:46,4
facts, the pictures,
and understand how


62
0:3:46,4 --> 0:3:48,48
water erodes rock.


63
0:3:48,48 --> 0:3:50,67
And why is that important?


64
0:3:50,67 --> 0:3:55,8
Well, wherever there was
water, there was life.


65
0:3:55,8 --> 0:3:56,5
GORDON MILLSAPS: This
is the only--


66
0:3:56,5 --> 0:4:1,12
not even NASA has like a
completely freestanding LEM


67
0:4:1,12 --> 0:4:3,33
module like this, aside from the
ones that are on the moon.


68
0:4:3,33 --> 0:4:6,46



69
0:4:6,46 --> 0:4:8,74
What we've got in here is
everything that the two


70
0:4:8,74 --> 0:4:12,38
astronauts will need for the
full mission, and then some.


71
0:4:12,38 --> 0:4:13,66
Everything from--


72
0:4:13,66 --> 0:4:16,54
I mean, we might put a little
more emphasis on vibe than the


73
0:4:16,54 --> 0:4:20,18
normal space program because we
have the DJ mixer over here


74
0:4:20,18 --> 0:4:22,58
with the CD player
and an iPod dock.


75
0:4:22,58 --> 0:4:28,32
We have the tequila, vodka,
and whiskey bar, including


76
0:4:28,32 --> 0:4:32,682
blunt pumps running through our
own homemade dispensers.


77
0:4:32,682 --> 0:4:36,14
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN):
Seven, six, five,


78
0:4:36,14 --> 0:4:40,586
four, three, two, one.


79
0:4:40,586 --> 0:4:41,836
Lift off.


80
0:4:41,836 --> 0:4:47,64



81
0:4:47,64 --> 0:4:50,25
VAN NEISTAT: That's
like the master.


82
0:4:50,25 --> 0:4:52,54
And then you have all of the
different cameras that are


83
0:4:52,54 --> 0:4:53,3
spaced out.


84
0:4:53,3 --> 0:4:56,94
So this is a chronological order
of the things that are


85
0:4:56,94 --> 0:4:58,496
going to happen.


86
0:4:58,496 --> 0:4:59,23
Right?


87
0:4:59,23 --> 0:5:2,51
So this is where you suit up,
in the quarantine, this is


88
0:5:2,51 --> 0:5:5,308
where the astronauts
will suit up.


89
0:5:5,308 --> 0:5:8,5
And then, eventually,
we get to the launch


90
0:5:8,5 --> 0:5:9,3
pad is right there.


91
0:5:9,3 --> 0:5:11,84
That's the rockets, et
cetera, et cetera.


92
0:5:11,84 --> 0:5:17,48
And what this is basically a
time line of the mission.


93
0:5:17,48 --> 0:5:18,2
GORDON MILLSAPS: What
I've learned


94
0:5:18,2 --> 0:5:20,36
about the space program--


95
0:5:20,36 --> 0:5:22,46
partly through our own work,
but also through our


96
0:5:22,46 --> 0:5:25,35
partnership with the folks at
Jet Propulsion Laboratory,


97
0:5:25,35 --> 0:5:28,7
with whom we've had a bit of a
back and forth think tank over


98
0:5:28,7 --> 0:5:30,31
the past two years-- where they
fly over to us, drink


99
0:5:30,31 --> 0:5:31,54
tequila, and talk about art.


100
0:5:31,54 --> 0:5:36,32
We fly over to them, drink
vodka, and talk about science.


101
0:5:36,32 --> 0:5:38,36
It's really that it's
just some dudes


102
0:5:38,36 --> 0:5:40,24
in a glorified garage.


103
0:5:40,24 --> 0:5:42,38
When they come over to our
studio, and we talk about the


104
0:5:42,38 --> 0:5:45,15
steering on the rover,
where we took a golf


105
0:5:45,15 --> 0:5:47,18
cart, cut it in half.


106
0:5:47,18 --> 0:5:50,37
And the winch, mounted it to the
steering so that you could


107
0:5:50,37 --> 0:5:54,11
have push-button steering
in your right hand.


108
0:5:54,11 --> 0:5:56,99
We all sat around and just kind
of fucked around with


109
0:5:56,99 --> 0:5:59,38
ideas with our buddies
from JPL.


110
0:5:59,38 --> 0:6:2,4
And then we were like, man, how
did you put those airbags


111
0:6:2,4 --> 0:6:3,68
on the Pathfinder
mission to Mars?


112
0:6:3,68 --> 0:6:4,75
And he was like, I don't know.


113
0:6:4,75 --> 0:6:6,74
We just tried some stuff, just
like we're doing now.


114
0:6:6,74 --> 0:6:8,69
And once it stopped popping,
we thought it might work.


115
0:6:8,69 --> 0:6:12,88
So we kind of realized there's a
greater affinity between the


116
0:6:12,88 --> 0:6:14,76
work that we have and
their work than we'd


117
0:6:14,76 --> 0:6:15,89
ever thought before.


118
0:6:15,89 --> 0:6:25,97
[MUSIC PLAYING]


119
0:6:25,97 --> 0:6:28,68
GORDON MILLSAPS: This isn't just
plywood and some artists,


120
0:6:28,68 --> 0:6:32,22
like, trying to tell you that
we're definitely going to Mars


121
0:6:32,22 --> 0:6:33,91
on the Park Avenue Armory.


122
0:6:33,91 --> 0:6:36,8
Like, we're actually dealing
with our friends at NASA and


123
0:6:36,8 --> 0:6:37,92
Jet Propulsion Laboratory.


124
0:6:37,92 --> 0:6:40,55
We're actually figuring out real
systems and talking about


125
0:6:40,55 --> 0:6:41,97
existing systems.


126
0:6:41,97 --> 0:6:44,95
And it's our hope that some of
that little stoke, little bit


127
0:6:44,95 --> 0:6:47,16
of excitement-- if one
five-year-old comes out of


128
0:6:47,16 --> 0:6:49,53
here with an idea that sticks
with him for a few years, long


129
0:6:49,53 --> 0:6:51,84
enough to get him to go and
study things a little bit


130
0:6:51,84 --> 0:6:54,84
deeper, every little bit
of it's worth it.


131
0:6:54,84 --> 0:6:58,56
TOM SACHS: I think what I've
learned from NASA is stay out


132
0:6:58,56 --> 0:6:59,48
of headquarters.


133
0:6:59,48 --> 0:7:1,3
Don't ask permission
from government.


134
0:7:1,3 --> 0:7:4,55
Do it yourself because they
will only mire you in


135
0:7:4,55 --> 0:7:5,47
bureaucracy.


136
0:7:5,47 --> 0:7:10,3
They will crush your spirit.


137
0:7:10,3 --> 0:7:12,602
Don't get a motorcycle
license.


138
0:7:12,602 --> 0:7:14,34
That's what I learned.


139
0:7:14,34 --> 0:7:17,8
Ride safe, but don't get
involved in the system.


140
0:7:17,8 --> 0:9:17,8
