2
0:0:1,768 --> 0:0:2,95
VICTORIA: Hello, everybody.


3
0:0:2,95 --> 0:0:5,62
Thanks so much for
coming to this talk


4
0:0:5,62 --> 0:0:10,81
by my wonderful friend James
who is also a first time author.


5
0:0:10,81 --> 0:0:13,25
I want to tell you three
quick things about James.


6
0:0:13,25 --> 0:0:17,8
The first is that James'
book is about the importance


7
0:0:17,8 --> 0:0:18,72
of experience.


8
0:0:18,72 --> 0:0:21,65
And I want to vouch for the
fact that this guy doesn't just


9
0:0:21,65 --> 0:0:23,94
talk the talk, he
walks the walk.


10
0:0:23,94 --> 0:0:28,25
James and I met 14 years--
ago almost to this day--


11
0:0:28,25 --> 0:0:33,881
on an overnight bus going from
Delhi to Rishikesh in India.


12
0:0:33,881 --> 0:0:35,63
For those of you who
don't know Rishikesh,


13
0:0:35,63 --> 0:0:38,46
it's supposed to be sort of
the yoga capital of the world,


14
0:0:38,46 --> 0:0:40,82
the Beatles went there to
see the Maharishi Mahesh,


15
0:0:40,82 --> 0:0:43,45
Jerry's ashes are
there, et cetera.


16
0:0:43,45 --> 0:0:45,74
And I was, of course, there
to go and check myself


17
0:0:45,74 --> 0:0:48,4
into an ashram to continue
to do the yoga that I


18
0:0:48,4 --> 0:0:49,19
was in love with.


19
0:0:49,19 --> 0:0:52,59
And James was there to learn
about this thing called yoga


20
0:0:52,59 --> 0:0:56,58
that he'd heard about but
didn't really know what it was.


21
0:0:56,58 --> 0:0:58,69
He said he was going to
be there for three days.


22
0:0:58,69 --> 0:1:0,79
And after we went
into this ashram,


23
0:1:0,79 --> 0:1:3,6
he sort of fell in
love with the Ashtanga,


24
0:1:3,6 --> 0:1:6,12
and the macrobiotic
diet, and the meditation,


25
0:1:6,12 --> 0:1:8,92
and the aura reading, and
even the homemade colonics,


26
0:1:8,92 --> 0:1:10,91
and basically,
decided to stay there


27
0:1:10,91 --> 0:1:12,68
for 30 days with
me, which is where


28
0:1:12,68 --> 0:1:14,5
we became such great friends.


29
0:1:14,5 --> 0:1:16,73
So this guy is the real deal.


30
0:1:16,73 --> 0:1:19,97
The second thing is that
when we were in India,


31
0:1:19,97 --> 0:1:23,2
James and I were
absolutely love struck.


32
0:1:23,2 --> 0:1:24,13
Not with each other.


33
0:1:24,13 --> 0:1:27,21
We actually both had
partners-- him in London


34
0:1:27,21 --> 0:1:30,11
and me in the States, and we're
no longer with these people--


35
0:1:30,11 --> 0:1:32,5
but we were so bored in
the ashram at night--


36
0:1:32,5 --> 0:1:35,1
absolutely nothing goes
on in an ashram at night--


37
0:1:35,1 --> 0:1:37,4
that we would write
these incredible love


38
0:1:37,4 --> 0:1:38,849
letters to our
significant others,


39
0:1:38,849 --> 0:1:40,39
and we would read
them to each other.


40
0:1:40,39 --> 0:1:41,92
That's how bored we were.


41
0:1:41,92 --> 0:1:44,92
And I can just tell you that he
is the most beautiful writer.


42
0:1:44,92 --> 0:1:48,91
So I'm so happy that 14 years
later, he has written a book.


43
0:1:48,91 --> 0:1:51,0
And the third
thing to tell you--


44
0:1:51,0 --> 0:1:53,3
just because it will
endear him to you--


45
0:1:53,3 --> 0:1:56,171
is that James is about to become
a father for the second time.


46
0:1:56,171 --> 0:1:58,42
He didn't know if he would
be able to make it out here


47
0:1:58,42 --> 0:1:59,92
in time before his
wife gives birth.


48
0:1:59,92 --> 0:2:1,731
So I'm very happy
that he's here.


49
0:2:1,731 --> 0:2:2,355
Welcome, James.


50
0:2:2,355 --> 0:2:8,526



51
0:2:8,526 --> 0:2:10,849
JAMES WALLMAN:
Thank you, Victoria.


52
0:2:10,849 --> 0:2:12,39
That's pretty funny
because I haven't


53
0:2:12,39 --> 0:2:14,247
heard that story for some time.


54
0:2:14,247 --> 0:2:16,33
Especially, the bit about
writing the love letters


55
0:2:16,33 --> 0:2:18,24
and reading them to each other.


56
0:2:18,24 --> 0:2:21,1
Because I've actually found some
I never got around to sending.


57
0:2:21,1 --> 0:2:23,81
And they are-- you know those
really embarrassing letters


58
0:2:23,81 --> 0:2:26,1
that you never sent
for good reason?


59
0:2:26,1 --> 0:2:28,1
So I'm touched that you
say I was a good writer,


60
0:2:28,1 --> 0:2:30,5
but I think I wasn't back then.


61
0:2:30,5 --> 0:2:32,38
But anyway, I appreciate
that very much.


62
0:2:32,38 --> 0:2:34,22
It's great to be back
in Mountain View.


63
0:2:34,22 --> 0:2:39,4
And I say back because I
lived in Palo Alto in 1997.


64
0:2:39,4 --> 0:2:41,71
And I have a strong
connection to Mountain View--


65
0:2:41,71 --> 0:2:43,9
a strong experiential
connection to Mountain View,


66
0:2:43,9 --> 0:2:46,3
actually-- because
when I was here,


67
0:2:46,3 --> 0:2:51,73
I learned how to scuba dive
with the Bayview Divers.


68
0:2:51,73 --> 0:2:54,35
Anyone learn to scuba
dive in Mountain View?


69
0:2:54,35 --> 0:2:55,26
I have the card.


70
0:2:55,26 --> 0:2:57,72
It's the card I've been using
on this trip to the States


71
0:2:57,72 --> 0:2:59,56
as my ID.


72
0:2:59,56 --> 0:3:0,68
So every time I was
in New York before,


73
0:3:0,68 --> 0:3:2,41
and I was going to buildings
like the Hearst Building,


74
0:3:2,41 --> 0:3:4,59
the Conde Nast Building,
the Time & Life Building,


75
0:3:4,59 --> 0:3:5,66
and they want to see ID.


76
0:3:5,66 --> 0:3:9,39
And I gave them the ID
of this scuba diving card


77
0:3:9,39 --> 0:3:12,56
I have from when I
was in my early 20s--


78
0:3:12,56 --> 0:3:15,833
I mean I look completely
different, obviously-- Anyway,


79
0:3:15,833 --> 0:3:17,416
and that was-- I
checked this out-- it


80
0:3:17,416 --> 0:3:18,54
was before Google started.


81
0:3:18,54 --> 0:3:20,4
It was a year before
Google started,


82
0:3:20,4 --> 0:3:21,425
so I was here first, all right.


83
0:3:21,425 --> 0:3:24,52



84
0:3:24,52 --> 0:3:25,995
Thank you for
coming, first of all.


85
0:3:25,995 --> 0:3:28,134
I really appreciate it.


86
0:3:28,134 --> 0:3:29,8
For those of you that
don't have a copy,


87
0:3:29,8 --> 0:3:31,892
the book is called
"Stuffication."


88
0:3:31,892 --> 0:3:33,35
And what I'd like
to do is give you


89
0:3:33,35 --> 0:3:36,9
an introduction to that,
where it came from for me.


90
0:3:36,9 --> 0:3:42,28
And the best place, I think, to
begin a story of "Stuffication"


91
0:3:42,28 --> 0:3:45,5
in a talk like this,
is a place where


92
0:3:45,5 --> 0:3:48,55
I think a lot of
great stories begin.


93
0:3:48,55 --> 0:3:52,45
In a time of war with
the young couple in love.


94
0:3:52,45 --> 0:3:58,56
So about 70 years ago--
on January 27, 1940--


95
0:3:58,56 --> 0:4:1,69
war was raging in
some parts of Europe.


96
0:4:1,69 --> 0:4:3,509
But in London, it
was still quite.


97
0:4:3,509 --> 0:4:4,8
It was a quiet night in London.


98
0:4:4,8 --> 0:4:7,76
There was snow falling gently.


99
0:4:7,76 --> 0:4:12,28
And just out of a busy,
bustling, noisy dance


100
0:4:12,28 --> 0:4:15,365
hall, a man by the
name of Jack, wearing


101
0:4:15,365 --> 0:4:19,44
a dark suit, a white
shirt, and a Dickey bow tie


102
0:4:19,44 --> 0:4:23,58
stepped outside with
his new bride, Pam.


103
0:4:23,58 --> 0:4:27,19
And he turned to Pam, and
he said to her, "Come on.


104
0:4:27,19 --> 0:4:28,58
Let's go home."


105
0:4:28,58 --> 0:4:32,65
And they tramped through
snow to their first home.


106
0:4:32,65 --> 0:4:34,28
They had two rooms.


107
0:4:34,28 --> 0:4:36,83
They had a living room
and they had a bedroom.


108
0:4:36,83 --> 0:4:39,83
The kitchen and the
bathroom was shared


109
0:4:39,83 --> 0:4:41,83
with the other people who
lived in the building.


110
0:4:41,83 --> 0:4:44,25
A few years later,
they had a son, Allen.


111
0:4:44,25 --> 0:4:47,99
And when Allen grew too big to
share the bedroom with them,


112
0:4:47,99 --> 0:4:49,8
they gave him the bedroom.


113
0:4:49,8 --> 0:4:52,67
So every night, after
Allen had gone to bed,


114
0:4:52,67 --> 0:4:55,35
they would make up one
of those camp beds.


115
0:4:55,35 --> 0:4:56,392
You know those camp beds?


116
0:4:56,392 --> 0:4:58,433
They would make up a camp
bed in the living room,


117
0:4:58,433 --> 0:4:59,56
and they would sleep there.


118
0:4:59,56 --> 0:5:3,24
And every morning, before
Allen left for his paper route,


119
0:5:3,24 --> 0:5:6,98
he would wake to the
sound of sizzling


120
0:5:6,98 --> 0:5:10,3
and the smell of bacon,
and eggs, and sausages,


121
0:5:10,3 --> 0:5:12,47
and something that
English people used


122
0:5:12,47 --> 0:5:14,91
to eat called fried bread.


123
0:5:14,91 --> 0:5:17,35
And Jack would get up
every morning, early,


124
0:5:17,35 --> 0:5:18,67
and make that for Allen.


125
0:5:18,67 --> 0:5:21,1
And he did that every
day until the day Allen


126
0:5:21,1 --> 0:5:27,24
left for university-- for
Liverpool University-- in 1962.


127
0:5:27,24 --> 0:5:29,25
Allen was the first
person in his family


128
0:5:29,25 --> 0:5:31,752
ever to go to university.


129
0:5:31,752 --> 0:5:32,71
He made the most of it.


130
0:5:32,71 --> 0:5:36,69
He played for the
university soccer team.


131
0:5:36,69 --> 0:5:39,35
Notice I said soccer.


132
0:5:39,35 --> 0:5:42,63
He saw bands that
were hugely famous,


133
0:5:42,63 --> 0:5:44,36
but he saw them before
they were famous.


134
0:5:44,36 --> 0:5:47,134
So of course, he saw the
Beatles and the Rolling Stones.


135
0:5:47,134 --> 0:5:48,8
And if you ever meet
him, he'll tell you


136
0:5:48,8 --> 0:5:52,32
that within five
minutes of meeting him.


137
0:5:52,32 --> 0:5:55,46
And then he did what most
of us do after university.


138
0:5:55,46 --> 0:5:59,82
He settled down, he got a job,
he got married, he had kids,


139
0:5:59,82 --> 0:6:1,69
and I'm one of them.


140
0:6:1,69 --> 0:6:3,46
Allen is my father.


141
0:6:3,46 --> 0:6:6,21
Jack is my grandfather.


142
0:6:6,21 --> 0:6:9,9
This is my back story.


143
0:6:9,9 --> 0:6:12,52
Why am I telling you this?


144
0:6:12,52 --> 0:6:20,26
Because in the story of our
everyday, workaday family,


145
0:6:20,26 --> 0:6:22,8
you can see the story
of stuffication.


146
0:6:22,8 --> 0:6:24,99
In the story of our
very typical family,


147
0:6:24,99 --> 0:6:29,2
you can see the shift
in circumstances


148
0:6:29,2 --> 0:6:31,8
from scarcity to abundance.


149
0:6:31,8 --> 0:6:33,68
And you can see the
change, as well,


150
0:6:33,68 --> 0:6:37,67
in terms of what that means for
our attitudes, our aspirations,


151
0:6:37,67 --> 0:6:39,13
and our values.


152
0:6:39,13 --> 0:6:44,5
You see my grandparents, Jack
and Pam, they were typical.


153
0:6:44,5 --> 0:6:48,21
They lived not so very
far from survival mode


154
0:6:48,21 --> 0:6:50,51
as most people did back then.


155
0:6:50,51 --> 0:6:56,25
And as 99% of humans had always
done since the dawn of time.


156
0:6:56,25 --> 0:6:58,69
And my father was typical, too.


157
0:6:58,69 --> 0:7:2,82
He was a typical,
materialistic baby boomer.


158
0:7:2,82 --> 0:7:6,676
And as a typical,
materialistic baby boomer--


159
0:7:6,676 --> 0:7:9,83
one of the key things he did was
that-- he measured his life--


160
0:7:9,83 --> 0:7:11,78
in many ways-- in
material terms.


161
0:7:11,78 --> 0:7:14,97
Like the homes he lived
in and the cars he drove.


162
0:7:14,97 --> 0:7:16,32
And I remember them all.


163
0:7:16,32 --> 0:7:23,39
From in the '70s, kind of
boxy, sky blue Triumph Toledo.


164
0:7:23,39 --> 0:7:25,45
Anyone know what a
Triumph Toledo is?


165
0:7:25,45 --> 0:7:26,55
But you can picture it.


166
0:7:26,55 --> 0:7:28,13
British built.


167
0:7:28,13 --> 0:7:28,92
It was OK.


168
0:7:28,92 --> 0:7:31,76
And in the '80s, he
moved on to much slicker,


169
0:7:31,76 --> 0:7:35,5
sportier, kind of curvier,
more imported cars.


170
0:7:35,5 --> 0:7:39,7
And he ended the decade
in a red Porsche 911.


171
0:7:39,7 --> 0:7:42,21
And he was typical,
too-- I think


172
0:7:42,21 --> 0:7:44,89
for his time-- in
that he grew up


173
0:7:44,89 --> 0:7:48,23
believing in the
counterintuitive idea,


174
0:7:48,23 --> 0:7:51,33
we should gain ground in the
early 20th century, which


175
0:7:51,33 --> 0:7:53,87
was at the very
heart of materialism.


176
0:7:53,87 --> 0:7:56,844
And was sometimes called
the American paradox.


177
0:7:56,844 --> 0:7:57,76
And that was the idea.


178
0:7:57,76 --> 0:8:2,1
That if we wanted to have
more, we had to spend more.


179
0:8:2,1 --> 0:8:6,6
A virtuous circle of materialism
that changed circumstances.


180
0:8:6,6 --> 0:8:8,3
Now do you remember
the last time


181
0:8:8,3 --> 0:8:12,27
you called someone
materialistic?


182
0:8:12,27 --> 0:8:15,46
Have you done that
in the last month?


183
0:8:15,46 --> 0:8:17,72
I ask people this, and
most people say nothing.


184
0:8:17,72 --> 0:8:18,99
Then, this one.


185
0:8:18,99 --> 0:8:21,42
Have you thought
someone's materialistic


186
0:8:21,42 --> 0:8:23,56
in the last month?


187
0:8:23,56 --> 0:8:24,2
OK.


188
0:8:24,2 --> 0:8:26,62
And it's quite an insulting
thing to think isn't it right?


189
0:8:26,62 --> 0:8:28,91
You're kind of
putting someone down.


190
0:8:28,91 --> 0:8:30,4
And that makes sense today.


191
0:8:30,4 --> 0:8:33,289
But back then,
saying someone was


192
0:8:33,289 --> 0:8:38,169
materialistic-- materialism--
wasn't such a bad idea.


193
0:8:38,169 --> 0:8:41,169
In fact, it made perfect
sense because it offered


194
0:8:41,169 --> 0:8:44,39
my father, Alan, and the
rest of the baby boomers


195
0:8:44,39 --> 0:8:47,14
the straightest route--
the straightest road--


196
0:8:47,14 --> 0:8:51,67
from the scarcity they'd been
born into to the abundance


197
0:8:51,67 --> 0:8:53,824
that they were
helping to create.


198
0:8:53,824 --> 0:8:55,24
The abundance and
the better world


199
0:8:55,24 --> 0:8:58,47
they were making for
themselves, for the society


200
0:8:58,47 --> 0:9:2,6
around them, and
for their children.


201
0:9:2,6 --> 0:9:8,32
So I grew up the benefactor
of that to a large extent.


202
0:9:8,32 --> 0:9:12,26
And I also grew up
believing in that idea.


203
0:9:12,26 --> 0:9:14,75
And I grew up thinking I
would be just like my dad.


204
0:9:14,75 --> 0:9:16,52
I would be materialistic.


205
0:9:16,52 --> 0:9:18,96
But then something happened.


206
0:9:18,96 --> 0:9:20,93
And I think lots of
things have happened.


207
0:9:20,93 --> 0:9:26,29
And they've all added up to this
situation I call stuffication


208
0:9:26,29 --> 0:9:28,91
So stuffication is
that feeling you


209
0:9:28,91 --> 0:9:35,12
get when you open up the closet,
and it's full of clothes,


210
0:9:35,12 --> 0:9:37,84
but you can't find a
single thing to wear.


211
0:9:37,84 --> 0:9:40,99
It's that feeling you
get when you root around


212
0:9:40,99 --> 0:9:44,54
inside a cupboard-- whatever
it might be-- to find the one


213
0:9:44,54 --> 0:9:48,829
thing you need through a pile
of stuff that you don't use.


214
0:9:48,829 --> 0:9:50,37
Instead of thinking
of more-- the way


215
0:9:50,37 --> 0:9:52,85
we used to-- as a
good thing, we now


216
0:9:52,85 --> 0:9:56,45
think more means more
hassle, more to store,


217
0:9:56,45 --> 0:9:59,0
more to manage,
more to think about.


218
0:9:59,0 --> 0:10:1,89
More isn't better
anymore, it's worse.


219
0:10:1,89 --> 0:10:4,74
I think overwhelmed,
suffocating from stuff,


220
0:10:4,74 --> 0:10:7,77
we're feeling stuffication.


221
0:10:7,77 --> 0:10:11,66
Why isn't materialism
working anymore?


222
0:10:11,66 --> 0:10:14,84
Now, as with anything
as-- I think--


223
0:10:14,84 --> 0:10:17,609
seismic of stuffication, there
are loads of different answers.


224
0:10:17,609 --> 0:10:19,15
If you ask a different
expert, you'll


225
0:10:19,15 --> 0:10:21,18
get a different emphasis.


226
0:10:21,18 --> 0:10:25,1
So a philosopher might say that
it's to do with status anxiety.


227
0:10:25,1 --> 0:10:26,78
We've had enough
of stuff because we


228
0:10:26,78 --> 0:10:29,24
had enough of the
status anxiety that


229
0:10:29,24 --> 0:10:31,73
comes with materialistic
consumerism.


230
0:10:31,73 --> 0:10:35,7
A psychologist like Oliver
James might say it's affluenza.


231
0:10:35,7 --> 0:10:38,39
We've had enough of
stuff because it's


232
0:10:38,39 --> 0:10:39,93
giving us affluenza.


233
0:10:39,93 --> 0:10:43,95
Mass consumption is
leading to mass depression.


234
0:10:43,95 --> 0:10:47,83
And a political
scientist, might say it's


235
0:10:47,83 --> 0:10:49,83
because of the stable society.


236
0:10:49,83 --> 0:10:51,88
We're just not so
bothered about stuff


237
0:10:51,88 --> 0:10:53,94
anymore because
we know that we're


238
0:10:53,94 --> 0:10:56,9
going to have a roof
over our heads tonight,


239
0:10:56,9 --> 0:10:58,65
and there's going to be
food on the table tomorrow.


240
0:10:58,65 --> 0:11:2,67
We're just not so bothered
about the basic materialistic


241
0:11:2,67 --> 0:11:3,52
concerns anymore.


242
0:11:3,52 --> 0:11:7,87
We've climbed that first stage
of Maslow's hierarchy of needs.


243
0:11:7,87 --> 0:11:10,1
An anthropologist
might say-- I'm


244
0:11:10,1 --> 0:11:12,4
going to quote here
from the Center


245
0:11:12,4 --> 0:11:15,15
on the Everyday Lives of people,
based in Los Angeles, which


246
0:11:15,15 --> 0:11:18,61
has just completed the most
comprehensive report ever


247
0:11:18,61 --> 0:11:22,3
conducted into how
people are living today.


248
0:11:22,3 --> 0:11:28,45
And they said-- that
we have more material


249
0:11:28,45 --> 0:11:30,8
things than any
preceding society.


250
0:11:30,8 --> 0:11:33,56
They use the term "light-years
more possessions than any


251
0:11:33,56 --> 0:11:35,99
preceding society
in human history."


252
0:11:35,99 --> 0:11:39,95
That we're struggling
under material saturation,


253
0:11:39,95 --> 0:11:42,24
there we're coping with
extraordinary clutter,


254
0:11:42,24 --> 0:11:45,4
and that we're in the
middle of a clutter crisis.


255
0:11:45,4 --> 0:11:48,94
And a technologist
might-- I think-- smile


256
0:11:48,94 --> 0:11:49,1
at all of these ideas.


257
0:11:49,1 --> 0:11:53,65
Ya sure, status anxiety,
affluenza, the stable society,


258
0:11:53,65 --> 0:11:54,45
clutter crisis.


259
0:11:54,45 --> 0:11:57,17
This is all relevant as to
why we've had enough of stuff.


260
0:11:57,17 --> 0:12:1,12
But the real reason that we're
moving on from material things


261
0:12:1,12 --> 0:12:3,62
is because we can.


262
0:12:3,62 --> 0:12:7,58
Why have a room full of
Encyclopedia Britannicas when


263
0:12:7,58 --> 0:12:9,8
you can search for
the answer you're


264
0:12:9,8 --> 0:12:12,6
looking for through-- as
a search angle-- Google,


265
0:12:12,6 --> 0:12:14,31
you can use.


266
0:12:14,31 --> 0:12:17,43
Worth a try, that joke, right?


267
0:12:17,43 --> 0:12:19,26
That's why I'm a
writer, not a comedian.


268
0:12:19,26 --> 0:12:21,66
Anyway, but thanks.


269
0:12:21,66 --> 0:12:24,306
But why have a car, why
have a second car, when


270
0:12:24,306 --> 0:12:27,0
you can use Zipcar
or you can use Uber?


271
0:12:27,0 --> 0:12:29,7
Why have a suitcase
full of books


272
0:12:29,7 --> 0:12:30,82
when you go on holiday--
for those of you


273
0:12:30,82 --> 0:12:32,702
that went on holiday
in the '70s and '80s--


274
0:12:32,702 --> 0:12:34,16
it was a real
challenge about which


275
0:12:34,16 --> 0:12:35,743
books were you going
to take with you.


276
0:12:35,743 --> 0:12:40,309
But why do that when
you have a Kindle?


277
0:12:40,309 --> 0:12:42,35
I think you know what it
looks like anyway right?


278
0:12:42,35 --> 0:12:45,54
But that-- thousands of books--
why have a room full of books?


279
0:12:45,54 --> 0:12:48,84



280
0:12:48,84 --> 0:12:50,71
I think all of these
reasons is partly


281
0:12:50,71 --> 0:12:53,29
responsible for stuffication.


282
0:12:53,29 --> 0:12:54,57
But if you think
about them-- I think


283
0:12:54,57 --> 0:12:58,24
what's really interesting about
them is none of them are blips.


284
0:12:58,24 --> 0:12:59,74
None of them are
blips that are here


285
0:12:59,74 --> 0:13:2,62
one year and likely
to be gone the next.


286
0:13:2,62 --> 0:13:7,1
I think they're all observable,
observed, long-term trends.


287
0:13:7,1 --> 0:13:9,48
And that's why I
think stuffication


288
0:13:9,48 --> 0:13:14,52
is going to be the defining
problem of the 21st century.


289
0:13:14,52 --> 0:13:19,53
So how do you solve a
problem like stuffication?


290
0:13:19,53 --> 0:13:22,78
Now my job-- the job of a
trend forecaster, not comedian


291
0:13:22,78 --> 0:13:27,54
as we've already
established-- is fascinating.


292
0:13:27,54 --> 0:13:31,32
It gives me really
interesting insight,


293
0:13:31,32 --> 0:13:33,51
gives me a really
unique viewpoint,


294
0:13:33,51 --> 0:13:37,51
and it opens me up
to a lot of ridicule.


295
0:13:37,51 --> 0:13:40,79
As Yogi Berra said, "It's
hard to make predictions,


296
0:13:40,79 --> 0:13:42,969
particularly about the future.


297
0:13:42,969 --> 0:13:45,26
And the thing is, if you're
going to make a prediction,


298
0:13:45,26 --> 0:13:46,5
if you're going
to say something's


299
0:13:46,5 --> 0:13:48,56
going to happen in the
future, at the very least,


300
0:13:48,56 --> 0:13:51,11
you'd better have a
decent methodology.


301
0:13:51,11 --> 0:13:56,98
So I don't look
into a crystal ball.


302
0:13:56,98 --> 0:14:0,5
And I don't read tea
leaves, and I've tried.


303
0:14:0,5 --> 0:14:2,7
Maybe in Rishikesh.


304
0:14:2,7 --> 0:14:7,95
And I don't breath in vapors
by the Oracle at Delphi.


305
0:14:7,95 --> 0:14:10,42
The method I use is
far less ancient,


306
0:14:10,42 --> 0:14:13,76
but I think it's
far more robust.


307
0:14:13,76 --> 0:14:16,0
It's inspired by
something a futurist--


308
0:14:16,0 --> 0:14:18,36
called William
Gibson-- once said,


309
0:14:18,36 --> 0:14:20,4
that "The future
is already here,


310
0:14:20,4 --> 0:14:23,2
it's just not very
evenly distributed. "


311
0:14:23,2 --> 0:14:26,46
And it's informed by a way
of reading cultural change,


312
0:14:26,46 --> 0:14:31,41
which has been applied more than
5,000 times since it was first


313
0:14:31,41 --> 0:14:34,87
codified by a sociologist
called Everett Rogers,


314
0:14:34,87 --> 0:14:38,64
Iowa State University in 1962.


315
0:14:38,64 --> 0:14:39,48
Some of you will
have heard of it.


316
0:14:39,48 --> 0:14:41,46
It's the diffusion
of innovations.


317
0:14:41,46 --> 0:14:44,29
And it's a way of reading
cultural change that works out


318
0:14:44,29 --> 0:14:48,27
how ideas, innovations,
new ways of living,


319
0:14:48,27 --> 0:14:50,43
working, cooking,
whatever it might be,


320
0:14:50,43 --> 0:14:53,326
spread from the innovators--
the few innovators


321
0:14:53,326 --> 0:14:57,53
to the early adopters, the
early majority, late majority,


322
0:14:57,53 --> 0:14:58,97
and [INAUDIBLE].


323
0:14:58,97 --> 0:15:5,2
So my job is to spot the
future here in the present.


324
0:15:5,2 --> 0:15:9,6
It's to identify the
innovators in the innovations,


325
0:15:9,6 --> 0:15:12,17
the big ideas that are
going to catch on and spread


326
0:15:12,17 --> 0:15:18,34
from these few people to
the many in the mainstream.


327
0:15:18,34 --> 0:15:22,22
So I've looked all around the
world looking for the answer,


328
0:15:22,22 --> 0:15:25,48
looking to understand
this problem better


329
0:15:25,48 --> 0:15:29,34
and to find an idea-- which
I think-- has the power,


330
0:15:29,34 --> 0:15:33,86
has the legs, has the ability
to move from these few


331
0:15:33,86 --> 0:15:35,21
to these many.


332
0:15:35,21 --> 0:15:38,18
And as you can imagine, I've
run up many blind alleys.


333
0:15:38,18 --> 0:15:40,47
I've kind of come
to lots of dead ends


334
0:15:40,47 --> 0:15:44,73
and all kinds of things that
I thought were the answer.


335
0:15:44,73 --> 0:15:47,62
Minimalism is a great example.


336
0:15:47,62 --> 0:15:49,392
But of all the things
I've looked at--


337
0:15:49,392 --> 0:15:50,85
and the book is,
to a large extent,


338
0:15:50,85 --> 0:15:53,616
a kind of process of me
going through this one,


339
0:15:53,616 --> 0:15:54,24
does this work?


340
0:15:54,24 --> 0:15:58,29
This one, does it work?-- I've
come across one idea, which


341
0:15:58,29 --> 0:16:1,64
I think is going to catch
on and become dominant.


342
0:16:1,64 --> 0:16:3,3
I call it experientialism.


343
0:16:3,3 --> 0:16:8,4
And the people who live
this way, experientialists.


344
0:16:8,4 --> 0:16:12,88
So the experientialists,
instead of looking for status,


345
0:16:12,88 --> 0:16:17,12
identity, happiness, and
meaning in material things--


346
0:16:17,12 --> 0:16:19,49
like materialists
did-- experientialists


347
0:16:19,49 --> 0:16:23,13
are finding status,
identity, happiness,


348
0:16:23,13 --> 0:16:27,2
and meaning, and
experiences instead.


349
0:16:27,2 --> 0:16:32,22
Experientialism-- and I've
said it a lot of times--


350
0:16:32,22 --> 0:16:37,24
I think can solve a
problem like stuffication.


351
0:16:37,24 --> 0:16:39,83
More importantly,
experientialism, I believe,


352
0:16:39,83 --> 0:16:42,51
will solve stuffication.


353
0:16:42,51 --> 0:16:46,58
And I say that because
firstly, it's better.


354
0:16:46,58 --> 0:16:48,68
It's just better
the materialism.


355
0:16:48,68 --> 0:16:51,13
Giving us status,
giving us identity,


356
0:16:51,13 --> 0:16:55,305
giving us meaning in our
lives, and making us happy.


357
0:16:55,305 --> 0:16:57,18
But more important than
that-- more important


358
0:16:57,18 --> 0:17:0,42
than being better--
I've seen the signs.


359
0:17:0,42 --> 0:17:1,0
I've seen the evidence.


360
0:17:1,0 --> 0:17:6,18
Even if it's still
unevenly distributed,


361
0:17:6,18 --> 0:17:9,369
that we are moving
away from materialism,


362
0:17:9,369 --> 0:17:12,15
and the experientialism
is making the leap


363
0:17:12,15 --> 0:17:17,25
from the innovative few to
the many in the mainstream.


364
0:17:17,25 --> 0:17:19,364
So first up,
there's the evidence


365
0:17:19,364 --> 0:17:21,68
that shows that our
attitudes are changing.


366
0:17:21,68 --> 0:17:23,52
There's a guy called
Ron Inglehart-- he's


367
0:17:23,52 --> 0:17:26,849
a political scientist at
the University of Michigan--


368
0:17:26,849 --> 0:17:32,11
and based on a hunch that
Ron had back in 1969,


369
0:17:32,11 --> 0:17:33,61
he started studying
our attitudes.


370
0:17:33,61 --> 0:17:37,71
And in 1970, he found
that 80% of people


371
0:17:37,71 --> 0:17:40,84
were materialistic
in Western countries.


372
0:17:40,84 --> 0:17:44,68
Now-- in today's
world-- it's 50%.


373
0:17:44,68 --> 0:17:47,83
So you can see very clear,
there is long-term decline


374
0:17:47,83 --> 0:17:51,33
in how materialistic we are.


375
0:17:51,33 --> 0:17:53,75
And I think where it's really
interesting is that, as well


376
0:17:53,75 --> 0:17:56,3
as our attitudes changing,
there is now evidence


377
0:17:56,3 --> 0:17:59,42
that our behavior is
changing, as well.


378
0:17:59,42 --> 0:18:1,85
There's a guy called Chris
Goodall-- he's a Cambridge


379
0:18:1,85 --> 0:18:4,7
grad, he was a
McKinsey consultant,


380
0:18:4,7 --> 0:18:7,89
he taught economics at
Harvard for a time--


381
0:18:7,89 --> 0:18:12,34
he has analyzed the material
flows-- the flow of materials--


382
0:18:12,34 --> 0:18:15,4
through Western
economies, so looking


383
0:18:15,4 --> 0:18:17,14
at the States and
the UK, for example.


384
0:18:17,14 --> 0:18:21,1
And he's discovered that we
are consuming less stuff.


385
0:18:21,1 --> 0:18:25,14
Less paper, concrete,
cars, steel, fertilizers,


386
0:18:25,14 --> 0:18:27,54
electricity.


387
0:18:27,54 --> 0:18:31,43
He's happy having
seen all this evidence


388
0:18:31,43 --> 0:18:35,2
to conclude that we've reached
the point of peak stuff,


389
0:18:35,2 --> 0:18:37,68
and that we're now
passing that point.


390
0:18:37,68 --> 0:18:40,8
Now besides those
there's technology.


391
0:18:40,8 --> 0:18:44,58
And I mean, technology in
terms of wearable tech.


392
0:18:44,58 --> 0:18:48,15
For example, the quantified
self movement, life logging,


393
0:18:48,15 --> 0:18:49,88
and social media.


394
0:18:49,88 --> 0:18:52,14
All of these things
make our lives


395
0:18:52,14 --> 0:18:56,18
much more connected, much
more trackable, and much more


396
0:18:56,18 --> 0:18:57,66
sharable.


397
0:18:57,66 --> 0:19:1,38
I imagine you're
aware of this, right?


398
0:19:1,38 --> 0:19:6,26
What's really interesting for me
about all these technologies--


399
0:19:6,26 --> 0:19:8,38
in particular, I think
the social aspect of it,


400
0:19:8,38 --> 0:19:10,42
social media-- is
they're fundamentally


401
0:19:10,42 --> 0:19:15,42
changing how we express our
identities and we get status.


402
0:19:15,42 --> 0:19:17,15
So go back to the 20th century.


403
0:19:17,15 --> 0:19:19,9
The best way to get status
and express your identity


404
0:19:19,9 --> 0:19:22,51
in the 20th century,
was through the stuff


405
0:19:22,51 --> 0:19:25,26
you owned-- handbag,
car, shoes, whatever


406
0:19:25,26 --> 0:19:27,93
it might be-- not
from what you did.


407
0:19:27,93 --> 0:19:31,52
Because back then,
who knew that you'd


408
0:19:31,52 --> 0:19:37,93
been to Utah or Tahoe
skiing for the weekend?


409
0:19:37,93 --> 0:19:41,89
Who knew you'd been to
Marrakech on your vacation?


410
0:19:41,89 --> 0:19:44,38
Who knew you'd been to a
really great talk from a trend


411
0:19:44,38 --> 0:19:47,71
forecaster at lunch time?


412
0:19:47,71 --> 0:19:48,57
Thank you for staying
with me there.


413
0:19:48,57 --> 0:19:51,26
I appreciate that.


414
0:19:51,26 --> 0:19:54,692
My wife says that was a
funny joke, but they you go.


415
0:19:54,692 --> 0:19:56,15
But the thing is,
in today's world,


416
0:19:56,15 --> 0:19:59,81
with all your followers on
Twitter, Instagram, Google+,


417
0:19:59,81 --> 0:20:5,14
and Facebook-- your friends,
fans, followers-- they do.


418
0:20:5,14 --> 0:20:8,35
So now if you take a
picture from the chair


419
0:20:8,35 --> 0:20:11,3
lift in Squaw
Valley or Park City,


420
0:20:11,3 --> 0:20:14,25
or if you take a picture of the
sun setting behind the Atlas


421
0:20:14,25 --> 0:20:18,26
mountains from the rooftop
of your riad in Marrakech,


422
0:20:18,26 --> 0:20:20,4
or you even tweet a
quote from something


423
0:20:20,4 --> 0:20:23,81
you heard a talk at lunch time.


424
0:20:23,81 --> 0:20:24,585
And this matters.


425
0:20:24,585 --> 0:20:26,21
This matters because
it matters for how


426
0:20:26,21 --> 0:20:28,84
we express our identities
and we get our status.


427
0:20:28,84 --> 0:20:32,31
And that matters for people
because status and identity


428
0:20:32,31 --> 0:20:33,73
matters, right?


429
0:20:33,73 --> 0:20:35,43
And social media
and this technology


430
0:20:35,43 --> 0:20:38,63
matters for the rise
of experientialism


431
0:20:38,63 --> 0:20:42,4
because this isn't the
innovative few anymore.


432
0:20:42,4 --> 0:20:46,29
There are hundreds of millions
of people using Instagram,


433
0:20:46,29 --> 0:20:47,25
Twitter, and Google+.


434
0:20:47,25 --> 0:20:50,21
There's 1.2 billion
people on Facebook--


435
0:20:50,21 --> 0:20:54,78
that's as many people as are
in the Catholic Church-- who


436
0:20:54,78 --> 0:20:59,44
are expressing their identities
and getting their status,


437
0:20:59,44 --> 0:21:3,12
not from what they have,
but from what they do.


438
0:21:3,12 --> 0:21:6,4
And this matters-- I
believe-- for you, for me,


439
0:21:6,4 --> 0:21:7,81
and for all of us.


440
0:21:7,81 --> 0:21:11,6
The question is, I guess, how?


441
0:21:11,6 --> 0:21:16,42
About 12 years ago--
on January 27, 2002--


442
0:21:16,42 --> 0:21:18,45
my father brought
my grandparents--


443
0:21:18,45 --> 0:21:23,3
Jack and Pam-- over for
lunch to my new apartment.


444
0:21:23,3 --> 0:21:24,27
It was my first home.


445
0:21:24,27 --> 0:21:26,28
It was in Brixton,
in south London


446
0:21:26,28 --> 0:21:29,2
and it had three bedrooms.


447
0:21:29,2 --> 0:21:31,61
I had a living room, I had
a separate dining room,


448
0:21:31,61 --> 0:21:35,39
a separate kitchen, had this
great, big, west facing garden.


449
0:21:35,39 --> 0:21:37,74
It was awesome for parties.


450
0:21:37,74 --> 0:21:39,2
It was a great first home.


451
0:21:39,2 --> 0:21:40,228
And they come over for lunch.


452
0:21:40,228 --> 0:21:43,5
And I had a job in
advertising at the time.


453
0:21:43,5 --> 0:21:44,75
I think I was a bit
gung-ho, talking


454
0:21:44,75 --> 0:21:48,11
quite big about how successful
I was and was going to be.


455
0:21:48,11 --> 0:21:51,37
And just before they
left, my grandfather


456
0:21:51,37 --> 0:21:53,84
handed me an envelope.


457
0:21:53,84 --> 0:21:58,3
And just after they left, I
opened it, as you can imagine.


458
0:21:58,3 --> 0:21:59,47
And it had a note in it.


459
0:21:59,47 --> 0:22:4,58
And it had on it 27/1/2002-- he
wrote the date the British way


460
0:22:4,58 --> 0:22:11,96
with the day and then the
month-- "On this day in 1940,


461
0:22:11,96 --> 0:22:14,82
Nana and I tramped through
snow to our first home.


462
0:22:14,82 --> 0:22:17,85
Memories live
longer than dreams.


463
0:22:17,85 --> 0:22:20,1
Good luck."


464
0:22:20,1 --> 0:22:24,38
A little bit later-- probably 20
to 25 minutes later-- my father


465
0:22:24,38 --> 0:22:28,46
was just driving back starting
to cross the river Thames--


466
0:22:28,46 --> 0:22:30,69
it was a black 5 Series
BMW, if you're keep up


467
0:22:30,69 --> 0:22:36,759
with the cars of my father--
and my grandfather choked.


468
0:22:36,759 --> 0:22:38,3
And he kind of
collapsed in his seat.


469
0:22:38,3 --> 0:22:39,93
My father obviously stopped.


470
0:22:39,93 --> 0:22:43,76
And then he drove
as fast as he could.


471
0:22:43,76 --> 0:22:44,93
He jumped lights.


472
0:22:44,93 --> 0:22:47,36
He actually got pulled over
and got a police escort.


473
0:22:47,36 --> 0:22:49,36
He did everything he could
to get my grandfather


474
0:22:49,36 --> 0:22:51,53
to a hospital as
quickly as possible.


475
0:22:51,53 --> 0:22:56,48



476
0:22:56,48 --> 0:22:59,68
He did what he could, but my
grandfather died that day.


477
0:22:59,68 --> 0:23:3,16
And obviously, I
thought about the note


478
0:23:3,16 --> 0:23:8,85
that he gave me quite
a lot since then.


479
0:23:8,85 --> 0:23:12,38
First of all, did
he know that he


480
0:23:12,38 --> 0:23:15,9
was going to die that day
when he gave me that note?


481
0:23:15,9 --> 0:23:21,0
And what did he mean by memories
live longer than dreams?


482
0:23:21,0 --> 0:23:27,13
Did he mean that the past is
not as good as the future?


483
0:23:27,13 --> 0:23:32,32
Or did he mean-- as I've come
to believe-- that the material


484
0:23:32,32 --> 0:23:35,4
dreams are all well
and good, but life


485
0:23:35,4 --> 0:23:40,58
is made of up memories,
which come from experiences?


486
0:23:40,58 --> 0:23:45,14
Now whatever he meant, it
was quite a passing shot.


487
0:23:45,14 --> 0:23:50,0
In those final
moments, to address


488
0:23:50,0 --> 0:23:52,31
the most important
question a person can ask.


489
0:23:52,31 --> 0:23:55,91
The question that Aristotle
asked in the Nicomachean


490
0:23:55,91 --> 0:23:57,87
Ethics, almost 2 and
1/2 thousand years ago.


491
0:23:57,87 --> 0:24:2,37
The question every one of us
should ask-- as individuals,


492
0:24:2,37 --> 0:24:5,75
as parents, as
influential people


493
0:24:5,75 --> 0:24:9,96
who market stuff and change the
world, being citizens or where


494
0:24:9,96 --> 0:24:11,72
we work, whatever it might be.


495
0:24:11,72 --> 0:24:16,32
And the question is-- I think
you know the question, right?


496
0:24:16,32 --> 0:24:20,57
How should we live
in order to be happy?


497
0:24:20,57 --> 0:24:23,32
And in the 20th century,
I think the answer


498
0:24:23,32 --> 0:24:26,51
to that, in many
ways, was clear.


499
0:24:26,51 --> 0:24:29,8
You should be
materialistic because that


500
0:24:29,8 --> 0:24:32,57
was creating abundance
for everybody.


501
0:24:32,57 --> 0:24:36,68
And I think in the 21st
century, when our problem isn't


502
0:24:36,68 --> 0:24:40,78
scarcity, our problem is
abundance-- I think so much


503
0:24:40,78 --> 0:24:43,56
abundance that there's time
of stuffication-- I think


504
0:24:43,56 --> 0:24:45,89
that quite the answer has
fundamentally changed.


505
0:24:45,89 --> 0:24:48,57



506
0:24:48,57 --> 0:24:53,12
So the story of
stuffication ends with you.


507
0:24:53,12 --> 0:24:56,47



508
0:24:56,47 --> 0:25:0,48
What are you going to do about
the most pressing problem


509
0:25:0,48 --> 0:25:3,52
of our time?


510
0:25:3,52 --> 0:25:9,1
There are 3 things you can do
to try out experientialism.


511
0:25:9,1 --> 0:25:9,9
Three steps.


512
0:25:9,9 --> 0:25:12,63
First step, destufficate.


513
0:25:12,63 --> 0:25:15,954
Step two, don't restufficate.


514
0:25:15,954 --> 0:25:17,87
Once you've gone through
the bother of getting


515
0:25:17,87 --> 0:25:20,78
rid of all that stuff you
don't wear, you don't need,


516
0:25:20,78 --> 0:25:21,74
you don't use.


517
0:25:21,74 --> 0:25:23,62
And it's so easy to
go out when you've


518
0:25:23,62 --> 0:25:25,93
created space in your
closet on your shelf,


519
0:25:25,93 --> 0:25:28,81
because we've been trained
to be consumers, to do that.


520
0:25:28,81 --> 0:25:31,7
But it's really important
not to go out and buy


521
0:25:31,7 --> 0:25:35,53
more stuff you don't need,
you don't use, you don't wear.


522
0:25:35,53 --> 0:25:38,192
But for me, step
3 is the best bet.


523
0:25:38,192 --> 0:25:39,9
Because 1 and 2 are
just hygiene factors.


524
0:25:39,9 --> 0:25:41,108
They're just starting points.


525
0:25:41,108 --> 0:25:43,3
Step 3 is a game.


526
0:25:43,3 --> 0:25:46,45
And it's a game I like to think
of as the Brewster's Millions


527
0:25:46,45 --> 0:25:48,26
game.


528
0:25:48,26 --> 0:25:51,17
Some of you probably won't
have read the 1902 novel


529
0:25:51,17 --> 0:25:54,6
or seen the 1985 movie.


530
0:25:54,6 --> 0:25:57,3
Anyone got no idea what
Brewsters Millions is?


531
0:25:57,3 --> 0:25:57,582
All right.


532
0:25:57,582 --> 0:25:58,29
Oh, a few of you.


533
0:25:58,29 --> 0:25:59,61
OK.


534
0:25:59,61 --> 0:26:5,226
It only got 6.4 out of 10 on
IMDB, which is a crying shame


535
0:26:5,226 --> 0:26:5,85
and it's wrong.


536
0:26:5,85 --> 0:26:6,78
It's a great movie.


537
0:26:6,78 --> 0:26:7,66
Anyway.


538
0:26:7,66 --> 0:26:9,98
So Brewster's
Millions, the movie,


539
0:26:9,98 --> 0:26:13,96
is about this guy who has to
spend $30 million in a month


540
0:26:13,96 --> 0:26:19,29
and have nothing physical,
tangible to show for it.


541
0:26:19,29 --> 0:26:21,87
Now to play the
game properly, you


542
0:26:21,87 --> 0:26:26,55
don't have to spend $30 million
in a month, unless you have it,


543
0:26:26,55 --> 0:26:29,67
that's obviously your choice.


544
0:26:29,67 --> 0:26:32,48
But what you do have to do--
to play the game properly


545
0:26:32,48 --> 0:26:34,37
and to really experience
the benefits-- is


546
0:26:34,37 --> 0:26:36,69
to spend the same
amount of money


547
0:26:36,69 --> 0:26:39,63
that you'd spend
in a normal month,


548
0:26:39,63 --> 0:26:42,2
but have nothing
physical, tangible


549
0:26:42,2 --> 0:26:44,62
to show for it at the end.


550
0:26:44,62 --> 0:26:48,14
And that's all you have to do
to join the experientialists.


551
0:26:48,14 --> 0:26:50,65



552
0:26:50,65 --> 0:26:55,61
And if you do that-- I promise
you-- you'll have more stories,


553
0:26:55,61 --> 0:26:59,37
you'll have more status,
you'll be happier,


554
0:26:59,37 --> 0:27:3,4
life will feel like it
has a lot more meaning.


555
0:27:3,4 --> 0:27:6,46
But more than that, I think
you'll be one of the pioneers.


556
0:27:6,46 --> 0:27:8,77
I think you'll be one
of the pioneers leading


557
0:27:8,77 --> 0:27:12,67
the rest of society out of
the storm of stuffication


558
0:27:12,67 --> 0:27:16,2
on the straightest, most
positive, most aspirational,


559
0:27:16,2 --> 0:27:19,34
most fun route to
a better world.


560
0:27:19,34 --> 0:27:22,81
I think you'll be one
of the pioneers leading


561
0:27:22,81 --> 0:27:24,86
the rest of America,
the rest of the West,


562
0:27:24,86 --> 0:27:29,23
the rest of the world from
the old age of materialism


563
0:27:29,23 --> 0:27:33,34
to this new era of
experientialism.


564
0:27:33,34 --> 0:27:35,34
And more than that
even, I think you'll


565
0:27:35,34 --> 0:27:38,1
understand what my
grandfather, Jack, meant


566
0:27:38,1 --> 0:27:40,465
that memories live
longer than dreams.


567
0:27:40,465 --> 0:27:43,89



568
0:27:43,89 --> 0:27:44,54
Thank you.


569
0:27:44,54 --> 0:27:53,41



570
0:27:53,41 --> 0:27:54,81
Questions, if anyone has any.


571
0:27:54,81 --> 0:27:59,76
AUDIENCE: So if we take this to
the end, and everybody becomes


572
0:27:59,76 --> 0:28:3,11
destuffified, and
we are so good at it


573
0:28:3,11 --> 0:28:8,46
that everybody around the
world becomes destuffified--


574
0:28:8,46 --> 0:28:10,79
JAMES WALLMAN: Destufficated,
but I like your version.


575
0:28:10,79 --> 0:28:12,16
AUDIENCE: That's right.


576
0:28:12,16 --> 0:28:14,276
So then what happens to Google?


577
0:28:14,276 --> 0:28:15,94
JAMES WALLMAN: Great
question, I think.


578
0:28:15,94 --> 0:28:16,44
OK.


579
0:28:16,44 --> 0:28:18,82
So I'm just going to
repeat that back to you.


580
0:28:18,82 --> 0:28:24,26
If everyone becomes
destuffified,


581
0:28:24,26 --> 0:28:25,354
what happens to Google?


582
0:28:25,354 --> 0:28:26,77
Can you be a little
more specific?


583
0:28:26,77 --> 0:28:28,186
I think I know
what you're saying.


584
0:28:28,186 --> 0:28:29,82



585
0:28:29,82 --> 0:28:33,16
If you take it to
its purest end,


586
0:28:33,16 --> 0:28:34,84
like we need to go
to the grocery store.


587
0:28:34,84 --> 0:28:37,275
We need stuff, certain stuff.


588
0:28:37,275 --> 0:28:40,192



589
0:28:40,192 --> 0:28:42,15
I guess what I'm confused
about in implementing


590
0:28:42,15 --> 0:28:46,11
this in my own life is,
what do you spend money


591
0:28:46,11 --> 0:28:49,81
on-- it's kind of a riddle--
what do you spend money


592
0:28:49,81 --> 0:28:52,255
on and have nothing
to show for it?


593
0:28:52,255 --> 0:28:53,13
You know what I mean?


594
0:28:53,13 --> 0:28:53,88
JAMES WALLMAN: OK.


595
0:28:53,88 --> 0:28:54,94
That's a great question.


596
0:28:54,94 --> 0:28:57,31
So how do you
spend money and not


597
0:28:57,31 --> 0:29:0,81
end up with
something at the end?


598
0:29:0,81 --> 0:29:3,285
When did you last go holiday?


599
0:29:3,285 --> 0:29:4,59
AUDIENCE: Friday.


600
0:29:4,59 --> 0:29:5,82
JAMES WALLMAN: Oh, great.


601
0:29:5,82 --> 0:29:7,67
Friday.


602
0:29:7,67 --> 0:29:9,4
Please give the man a mic.


603
0:29:9,4 --> 0:29:10,706
Where did you go?


604
0:29:10,706 --> 0:29:12,56
AUDIENCE: I went and
bought a new car.


605
0:29:12,56 --> 0:29:15,51



606
0:29:15,51 --> 0:29:16,26
JAMES WALLMAN: OK.


607
0:29:16,26 --> 0:29:19,5
Can I-- just to get a
little bit of clarity here,


608
0:29:19,5 --> 0:29:22,92
that's not playing the game.


609
0:29:22,92 --> 0:29:25,28
A holiday is not buying a car.


610
0:29:25,28 --> 0:29:28,28
You've actually picked up on
two very brilliant examples


611
0:29:28,28 --> 0:29:29,78
of different purchases.


612
0:29:29,78 --> 0:29:31,59
I have a car and
I take holidays.


613
0:29:31,59 --> 0:29:34,3
I would conceive one of
those-- don't get me wrong,


614
0:29:34,3 --> 0:29:36,55
it gives me experiences--
but one is quite a material


615
0:29:36,55 --> 0:29:37,592
purchase.


616
0:29:37,592 --> 0:29:39,5
The thing about
not having anything


617
0:29:39,5 --> 0:29:41,719
at the end of it, a great
example is a holiday.


618
0:29:41,719 --> 0:29:43,76
That's why I wanted to
follow it down that route.


619
0:29:43,76 --> 0:29:47,51
I didn't know you were
going to play nasty.


620
0:29:47,51 --> 0:29:52,8
So let's say you go
skiing for a week.


621
0:29:52,8 --> 0:29:54,662
What do you have,
physically, at the end of it?


622
0:29:54,662 --> 0:29:56,62
You might have some
pictures on your telephone,


623
0:29:56,62 --> 0:29:58,55
but, really what you've
had, is a great time.


624
0:29:58,55 --> 0:30:0,86
Or let's say you go
on a stag party, which


625
0:30:0,86 --> 0:30:3,4
is a-- what do you
call it over here?


626
0:30:3,4 --> 0:30:4,45
Bachelor Party.


627
0:30:4,45 --> 0:30:7,81
You don't take any
pictures, right?


628
0:30:7,81 --> 0:30:10,3
But you have an amazing time.


629
0:30:10,3 --> 0:30:13,735
It gives you [INAUDIBLE] and
identity are quite closely


630
0:30:13,735 --> 0:30:16,15
connected, gives
you real identity,


631
0:30:16,15 --> 0:30:17,851
it gives you, hopefully,
some happiness.


632
0:30:17,851 --> 0:30:20,1
You've had a good time, if
you can remember any of it.


633
0:30:20,1 --> 0:30:23,9
And it gives life
a sense of meaning.


634
0:30:23,9 --> 0:30:26,53
But you don't come back from
it with a whole bunch of stuff,


635
0:30:26,53 --> 0:30:27,3
do you?


636
0:30:27,3 --> 0:30:28,35
Hopefully, you've lost stuff.


637
0:30:28,35 --> 0:30:30,69
Anyway, so just to
be really clear.


638
0:30:30,69 --> 0:30:33,13
So in terms of what I
mean by experiences,


639
0:30:33,13 --> 0:30:37,97
is that which is something
where you're doing something


640
0:30:37,97 --> 0:30:39,25
rather than having something.


641
0:30:39,25 --> 0:30:41,1
That's the kind of
classic distinction.


642
0:30:41,1 --> 0:30:45,71
There's two psychologists--
called [INAUDIBLE]


643
0:30:45,71 --> 0:30:50,76
and Tom Gilovich-- and they had
a paper they published in 2003


644
0:30:50,76 --> 0:30:51,92
called, "To Do or To Have?


645
0:30:51,92 --> 0:30:53,4
That Is the Question."


646
0:30:53,4 --> 0:30:55,23
And it was-- it is--
considered to be


647
0:30:55,23 --> 0:30:59,2
the kind of classic
moment in research.


648
0:30:59,2 --> 0:31:2,25
To find, for the first
time, whether material goods


649
0:31:2,25 --> 0:31:4,31
or experiential goods gave
people more happiness.


650
0:31:4,31 --> 0:31:5,81
And they proved,
for the first time,


651
0:31:5,81 --> 0:31:8,5
that experiential goods
gave people more happiness.


652
0:31:8,5 --> 0:31:10,91
But to begin that
piece of research,


653
0:31:10,91 --> 0:31:13,524
they started by saying,
what's a material good?


654
0:31:13,524 --> 0:31:14,69
What's an experiential good?


655
0:31:14,69 --> 0:31:18,8
Because for some people, a TV is
experiential, and some people,


656
0:31:18,8 --> 0:31:20,0
it's material.


657
0:31:20,0 --> 0:31:22,71
Just to be really clear,
this is not anti-consumerist,


658
0:31:22,71 --> 0:31:26,17
it's not anti-capitalists,
it's not even anti stuff.


659
0:31:26,17 --> 0:31:30,47
It's totally pro
consumers, pro capitalist,


660
0:31:30,47 --> 0:31:31,76
and it's not anti stuff.


661
0:31:31,76 --> 0:31:33,71
It's having stuff.


662
0:31:33,71 --> 0:31:35,85
We bought a bread maker
a couple of weeks ago.


663
0:31:35,85 --> 0:31:38,71
Now that has got the potential
to be a waste of money.


664
0:31:38,71 --> 0:31:40,75
But my wife insists
that we will use it--


665
0:31:40,75 --> 0:31:42,61
and we fully intend
to-- in which case,


666
0:31:42,61 --> 0:31:44,32
it's got use, right?


667
0:31:44,32 --> 0:31:45,87
So it's not anti
having stuff, it's


668
0:31:45,87 --> 0:31:49,299
anti having too much stuff.


669
0:31:49,299 --> 0:31:50,59
Does that answer your question?


670
0:31:50,59 --> 0:31:51,25
AUDIENCE: That does.


671
0:31:51,25 --> 0:31:51,77
Yeah.


672
0:31:51,77 --> 0:31:53,36
I now know how to implement
your three principles.


673
0:31:53,36 --> 0:31:54,3
JAMES WALLMAN: Great.


674
0:31:54,3 --> 0:31:54,44
Thank you.


675
0:31:54,44 --> 0:31:54,939
Good.


676
0:31:54,939 --> 0:31:55,54
AUDIENCE: Hi.


677
0:31:55,54 --> 0:31:57,46
I think you make some
very interesting points.


678
0:31:57,46 --> 0:32:0,88
I mean, I can relate to what
you say in terms of my parents


679
0:32:0,88 --> 0:32:3,42
lived a simpler life than me.


680
0:32:3,42 --> 0:32:5,34
My grandparents
lived a simpler life.


681
0:32:5,34 --> 0:32:6,83
And they were happier.


682
0:32:6,83 --> 0:32:8,35
They were more social.


683
0:32:8,35 --> 0:32:9,41
They interacted
with more people.


684
0:32:9,41 --> 0:32:11,77
They had fewer things.


685
0:32:11,77 --> 0:32:16,33
Another trend I've
seen in my generation


686
0:32:16,33 --> 0:32:18,8
is not just materialism,
but it's also boredom.


687
0:32:18,8 --> 0:32:19,82
People are just bored.


688
0:32:19,82 --> 0:32:21,22
If we have so many things to do.


689
0:32:21,22 --> 0:32:23,68
We have more to do,
we are always bored.


690
0:32:23,68 --> 0:32:26,75
I've never heard that word
from my previous generations.


691
0:32:26,75 --> 0:32:30,797
So do you see a correlation
between the two?


692
0:32:30,797 --> 0:32:32,38
JAMES WALLMAN: That's
a great question


693
0:32:32,38 --> 0:32:36,705
that no one has asked me in
any presentation I've given.


694
0:32:36,705 --> 0:32:39,8
So you-- can I just say back
to you-- saying there are so


695
0:32:39,8 --> 0:32:40,91
many things to do, we're bored.


696
0:32:40,91 --> 0:32:43,22
AUDIENCE: People get
bored with their job.


697
0:32:43,22 --> 0:32:46,1
They have more opportunity,
but every type of person


698
0:32:46,1 --> 0:32:48,94
you talk to, their like,
I'm so bored with my job.


699
0:32:48,94 --> 0:32:51,74
Whereas, if I look at my uncle--
who worked at the same place


700
0:32:51,74 --> 0:32:54,39
for 30 years-- he never
used the term bored.


701
0:32:54,39 --> 0:32:57,694
They were just happy
doing what they did.


702
0:32:57,694 --> 0:33:1,14
JAMES WALLMAN: I'd really like
to give a good answer generally


703
0:33:1,14 --> 0:33:2,64
but I don't know
if I have an answer


704
0:33:2,64 --> 0:33:7,33
because I think having loads of
possibilities-- I mean, boredom


705
0:33:7,33 --> 0:33:8,862
is your own
responsibility, right?


706
0:33:8,862 --> 0:33:10,82
It comes to the weekend
and you've got a choice


707
0:33:10,82 --> 0:33:13,74
of-- especially where
you guys live, right?--


708
0:33:13,74 --> 0:33:16,14
there's so many outdoor
activities you can do.


709
0:33:16,14 --> 0:33:19,252
Or you can go to San Francisco.


710
0:33:19,252 --> 0:33:20,71
I mean, the world's,
kind of, here.


711
0:33:20,71 --> 0:33:22,68
There's so many
things we can do now.


712
0:33:22,68 --> 0:33:24,52
I think being bored is terrible.


713
0:33:24,52 --> 0:33:27,144
And if you're bored of your job,
you should do a different job.


714
0:33:27,144 --> 0:33:29,55
I, personally, am
infused by my job.


715
0:33:29,55 --> 0:33:31,96
And it's been my
experience of the people


716
0:33:31,96 --> 0:33:34,37
that I-- I was in New
York for a few days,


717
0:33:34,37 --> 0:33:36,48
I've now been here in
California for a few days,


718
0:33:36,48 --> 0:33:41,41
and everyone-- I've talked to
seems to be really fired up.


719
0:33:41,41 --> 0:33:43,75
We went to a great
Super Bowl party


720
0:33:43,75 --> 0:33:47,65
and no one seemed bored at all.


721
0:33:47,65 --> 0:33:51,4
I don't know, is this
just a general malaise?


722
0:33:51,4 --> 0:33:51,9
OK.


723
0:33:51,9 --> 0:33:53,77
Because I would have thought,
if you've got more things to do,


724
0:33:53,77 --> 0:33:55,7
it's just a question
of having-- there


725
0:33:55,7 --> 0:33:57,66
are challenges with attention.


726
0:33:57,66 --> 0:33:58,889
Absolutely no doubt about it.


727
0:33:58,889 --> 0:34:0,93
There are challenges with
sticking with something


728
0:34:0,93 --> 0:34:3,3
long enough to enjoy it.


729
0:34:3,3 --> 0:34:5,79
But I don't know if I can
answer that better than that.


730
0:34:5,79 --> 0:34:8,639
AUDIENCE: It's probably related
to lack of attention span.


731
0:34:8,639 --> 0:34:10,82
Over time, we've
lost attention span


732
0:34:10,82 --> 0:34:13,389
with so many things around us.


733
0:34:13,389 --> 0:34:16,75
Kind of like you said,
we open our closet,


734
0:34:16,75 --> 0:34:18,198
but we don't like anything.


735
0:34:18,198 --> 0:34:20,239
And it's like, what is it
that we're looking for?


736
0:34:20,239 --> 0:34:23,73
We have lost that,
to some extent.


737
0:34:23,73 --> 0:34:24,489
JAMES WALLMAN:
Well you can become


738
0:34:24,489 --> 0:34:25,892
a kind of zombie consumer.


739
0:34:25,892 --> 0:34:27,35
You just buy more
stuff because you


740
0:34:27,35 --> 0:34:29,12
think it's going
to solve problems.


741
0:34:29,12 --> 0:34:31,3
You're going to turn
to retail therapy.


742
0:34:31,3 --> 0:34:33,15
But that's the truth
about retail therapy,


743
0:34:33,15 --> 0:34:35,65
in terms of buying stuff, it
won't make you any happier.


744
0:34:35,65 --> 0:34:37,96
But if you buy an
experiential good,


745
0:34:37,96 --> 0:34:40,949
like going on a rock
climbing course,


746
0:34:40,949 --> 0:34:44,25
you'll be so scared you
won't be able to be bored.


747
0:34:44,25 --> 0:34:46,449
So if you're bored, go
rock climbing, or skiing,


748
0:34:46,449 --> 0:34:47,159
or surfing.


749
0:34:47,159 --> 0:34:49,125
That's frightening, too.


750
0:34:49,125 --> 0:34:52,53
AUDIENCE: What's different
with social media


751
0:34:52,53 --> 0:34:59,92
now replacing some of the
materialistic aspects of that


752
0:34:59,92 --> 0:35:3,64
is different from coming
back with a bunch of slides


753
0:35:3,64 --> 0:35:7,18
or coming back with some videos
that I took on my camcorder?


754
0:35:7,18 --> 0:35:8,43
JAMES WALLMAN: Great question.


755
0:35:8,43 --> 0:35:8,93
Thank you.


756
0:35:8,93 --> 0:35:12,67
I think this comes to the heart
why social media is important.


757
0:35:12,67 --> 0:35:16,599
If you-- I'm going to guess
you're in your 20s, right?


758
0:35:16,599 --> 0:35:17,64
AUDIENCE: Just left them.


759
0:35:17,64 --> 0:35:19,13
JAMES WALLMAN: OK.


760
0:35:19,13 --> 0:35:23,55
So if you went on holiday in
the '90s, or your friends--


761
0:35:23,55 --> 0:35:26,5
you ever remember going to a
friend's house in the '90s,


762
0:35:26,5 --> 0:35:28,572
and they-- would pull
out their holiday snaps.


763
0:35:28,572 --> 0:35:30,78
And there was that that
awful moment where you think,


764
0:35:30,78 --> 0:35:31,5
Oh, God.


765
0:35:31,5 --> 0:35:34,32
And they'd show you a
picture Jean at the Acropolis


766
0:35:34,32 --> 0:35:38,18
and then Jean eats souvlaki and
then Jean doing something else.


767
0:35:38,18 --> 0:35:41,48
How painfully dull
was that, right?


768
0:35:41,48 --> 0:35:43,23
And it took them-- if
you think about it--


769
0:35:43,23 --> 0:35:45,72
how long did it
take them to share


770
0:35:45,72 --> 0:35:47,685
their holiday with people?


771
0:35:47,685 --> 0:35:50,6
Because they would have had
to have, not just you around,


772
0:35:50,6 --> 0:35:51,25
all their other friends.


773
0:35:51,25 --> 0:35:54,235
So let's say it's
the '90s, and you


774
0:35:54,235 --> 0:35:56,14
go on a really
incredible holiday.


775
0:35:56,14 --> 0:35:57,802
Let's say you go to Greece, and
you're really excited about it,


776
0:35:57,802 --> 0:35:59,33
and you go see the
ruins, et cetera.


777
0:35:59,33 --> 0:36:1,75
And you want to tell
100 of your best friends


778
0:36:1,75 --> 0:36:3,56
about your holiday.


779
0:36:3,56 --> 0:36:6,137
And let's say-- it's hard
to do it at a party--


780
0:36:6,137 --> 0:36:8,47
so you need to see them at
dinner or at personal drinks,


781
0:36:8,47 --> 0:36:9,46
right?


782
0:36:9,46 --> 0:36:12,23
So let's say you can
manage 6 people at a time.


783
0:36:12,23 --> 0:36:13,81
Stay with me here for the math.


784
0:36:13,81 --> 0:36:17,52
So you've got to have 10,
15 different arrangements


785
0:36:17,52 --> 0:36:19,1
to see people.


786
0:36:19,1 --> 0:36:22,44
That takes a long time-- takes
like a couple of months--


787
0:36:22,44 --> 0:36:25,92
to share with people
your experiences.


788
0:36:25,92 --> 0:36:28,45
Whereas today, you could
post it on Facebook,


789
0:36:28,45 --> 0:36:30,46
and you've got your
500, 600 friends that


790
0:36:30,46 --> 0:36:32,13
are right there that can see it.


791
0:36:32,13 --> 0:36:36,54
So what social media has done
has catalyzed that opportunity


792
0:36:36,54 --> 0:36:38,362
to share what you're doing.


793
0:36:38,362 --> 0:36:39,82
So if you'd just
run a Tough Mudder


794
0:36:39,82 --> 0:36:42,69
course-- I think this is one of
the reasons why Tough Mudder is


795
0:36:42,69 --> 0:36:46,49
increasing so quickly--
you can instantly


796
0:36:46,49 --> 0:36:47,95
share that with people.


797
0:36:47,95 --> 0:36:51,51
And that has a real impact
on how you see yourself.


798
0:36:51,51 --> 0:36:56,5
It has a real impact on how you
present yourselves to others.


799
0:36:56,5 --> 0:36:59,82
So that's what social
media has done.


800
0:36:59,82 --> 0:37:1,9
I constantly hear
about Facebook,


801
0:37:1,9 --> 0:37:3,41
it'll be something else next.


802
0:37:3,41 --> 0:37:6,74
It doesn't matter which platform
it is that people are using.


803
0:37:6,74 --> 0:37:9,19
We now are used to the
idea of social media.


804
0:37:9,19 --> 0:37:11,102
It will stay with us.


805
0:37:11,102 --> 0:37:13,6
Now that means there's
been a fundamental shift


806
0:37:13,6 --> 0:37:15,69
from having things
to doing things


807
0:37:15,69 --> 0:37:17,82
in terms of expressing
our identities.


808
0:37:17,82 --> 0:37:22,209
AUDIENCE: So I'm a Millennial,
a group about whom our consumer


809
0:37:22,209 --> 0:37:23,75
behavior as much
has been speculated.


810
0:37:23,75 --> 0:37:26,54
We are the group least likely
to buy a car now, least


811
0:37:26,54 --> 0:37:27,84
likely to buy a house.


812
0:37:27,84 --> 0:37:30,305
And I always get a
little weary when


813
0:37:30,305 --> 0:37:31,68
I hear about how
people are like,


814
0:37:31,68 --> 0:37:35,6
oh, your generation just values
Instagram and social media


815
0:37:35,6 --> 0:37:38,5
and you like experiences more
than things because you just


816
0:37:38,5 --> 0:37:41,52
like sharing your every
thought on Facebook.


817
0:37:41,52 --> 0:37:43,61
Mostly, it's actually
because I think


818
0:37:43,61 --> 0:37:46,6
were less likely to buy cars
because-- like me instead--


819
0:37:46,6 --> 0:37:49,35
you're spending the equivalent
of a brand new BMW S


820
0:37:49,35 --> 0:37:51,3
series on your education.


821
0:37:51,3 --> 0:37:54,85
And so it's not so much that
I like Instagraming photos


822
0:37:54,85 --> 0:37:58,19
from my bike ride more, as I
feel like I have actually less


823
0:37:58,19 --> 0:38:0,1
money to spend on stuff.


824
0:38:0,1 --> 0:38:4,5
And so I'm wondering what
the recession you feel


825
0:38:4,5 --> 0:38:7,387
might play into this movement
away from stuff, how you think


826
0:38:7,387 --> 0:38:9,97
it's maybe going to be different
for people for my generation,


827
0:38:9,97 --> 0:38:12,81
for whom, things are
just going to become


828
0:38:12,81 --> 0:38:14,74
less part of the picture
because of the rising


829
0:38:14,74 --> 0:38:17,72
cost of other things, like
healthcare, like education.


830
0:38:17,72 --> 0:38:19,59
And whether or
not you think then


831
0:38:19,59 --> 0:38:22,27
that some of your advice on how
you would implement those three


832
0:38:22,27 --> 0:38:25,51
steps would be different.


833
0:38:25,51 --> 0:38:27,5
JAMES WALLMAN: Good questions.


834
0:38:27,5 --> 0:38:28,45
I think you've asked me
quite a lot of things there.


835
0:38:28,45 --> 0:38:29,99
I'm going to try
to say back to you.


836
0:38:29,99 --> 0:38:30,43
No, it's fine.


837
0:38:30,43 --> 0:38:32,64
It's really interesting.
, Especially since you are


838
0:38:32,64 --> 0:38:34,61
a Millennial, it's very easy
for me stand here and say,


839
0:38:34,61 --> 0:38:37,3
Millennial's are doing this,
but you are a Millennial.


840
0:38:37,3 --> 0:38:41,5
So you're asking me,
how should a Millennial


841
0:38:41,5 --> 0:38:44,9
implement those three steps?


842
0:38:44,9 --> 0:38:49,9
That was your final part, but
before that you were saying,


843
0:38:49,9 --> 0:38:51,73
what do I think about education?


844
0:38:51,73 --> 0:38:53,99
Where does education
fit into this?


845
0:38:53,99 --> 0:38:54,657
And the economy.


846
0:38:54,657 --> 0:38:56,198
Education, economy,
and how does that


847
0:38:56,198 --> 0:38:58,315
affect Millennials and
this shift from materialism


848
0:38:58,315 --> 0:38:59,32
to experientialism.


849
0:38:59,32 --> 0:39:3,56
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I'm wondering
how you see the recession


850
0:39:3,56 --> 0:39:5,68
and rising costs of education is
factoring into people's choice


851
0:39:5,68 --> 0:39:7,309
not to buy things.


852
0:39:7,309 --> 0:39:8,35
JAMES WALLMAN: All right.


853
0:39:8,35 --> 0:39:12,58
So the economy is a
really complicated one--


854
0:39:12,58 --> 0:39:15,322
to be frank with you--
because it's certainly


855
0:39:15,322 --> 0:39:17,3
something I would
never try and forecast.


856
0:39:17,3 --> 0:39:18,59
Because there's so much.


857
0:39:18,59 --> 0:39:21,722



858
0:39:21,722 --> 0:39:23,18
In terms of how it
affects people--


859
0:39:23,18 --> 0:39:25,94
I think is really
interesting because-- there's


860
0:39:25,94 --> 0:39:28,85
a particular time of your life
and if there is a recession--


861
0:39:28,85 --> 0:39:32,0
or there's a lack of money in
your family around that time--


862
0:39:32,0 --> 0:39:34,6
you become much
more materialistic


863
0:39:34,6 --> 0:39:35,29
than other people.


864
0:39:35,29 --> 0:39:36,915
So this kind of
broad brush approach,


865
0:39:36,915 --> 0:39:39,29
that the boomers were this,
and the Millennials are this,


866
0:39:39,29 --> 0:39:43,1
and Gen X are like this,
it's quite broad brush


867
0:39:43,1 --> 0:39:44,56
over-- generalizations.


868
0:39:44,56 --> 0:39:45,85
And there will be different
people within that.


869
0:39:45,85 --> 0:39:47,47
My brother and I
are two years apart,


870
0:39:47,47 --> 0:39:49,68
and he is far more
materialistic than me.


871
0:39:49,68 --> 0:39:52,585
Because not long after my
father having that Porsche,


872
0:39:52,585 --> 0:39:53,662
his company disappeared.


873
0:39:53,662 --> 0:39:55,37
And therefore, all
the money did as well.


874
0:39:55,37 --> 0:39:57,81
Therefore, my brother went
through a crucial period


875
0:39:57,81 --> 0:39:59,34
where we had no money.


876
0:39:59,34 --> 0:40:1,74
And therefore, he's much
more materialistic than I am.


877
0:40:1,74 --> 0:40:4,789
So the economy will affect
this is an interesting way.


878
0:40:4,789 --> 0:40:6,33
And some people will
feel less stable


879
0:40:6,33 --> 0:40:9,6
and therefore, become
more materialistic.


880
0:40:9,6 --> 0:40:11,25
But we've also had
recessions before.


881
0:40:11,25 --> 0:40:13,45
That kind of comes and goes.


882
0:40:13,45 --> 0:40:14,42
I don't know if
you Nate Silver's


883
0:40:14,42 --> 0:40:17,57
"The Signal and the Noise" but
if you consider how forecasting


884
0:40:17,57 --> 0:40:19,99
works, and the way
that trends work,


885
0:40:19,99 --> 0:40:23,35
you may consider the idea
that 80% of people that


886
0:40:23,35 --> 0:40:25,41
were materialistic,
and now it's 50%.


887
0:40:25,41 --> 0:40:29,12
Within that time, it
will go down a bit.


888
0:40:29,12 --> 0:40:31,28
So I think there's
still a long term trend.


889
0:40:31,28 --> 0:40:32,81
In terms of
education, I would say


890
0:40:32,81 --> 0:40:36,7
education is a great example
of an experiential good.


891
0:40:36,7 --> 0:40:38,59
It's not tangible.


892
0:40:38,59 --> 0:40:41,1
I don't know what your
educational situation is,


893
0:40:41,1 --> 0:40:45,19
but for those of us that have
a degree of the first level,


894
0:40:45,19 --> 0:40:50,84
the next level, or a doctorate,
how many of us have the--


895
0:40:50,84 --> 0:40:52,71
do you get
certificates over here?


896
0:40:52,71 --> 0:40:53,99
Do you keep them?


897
0:40:53,99 --> 0:40:57,64
I have no idea where
my certificates are.


898
0:40:57,64 --> 0:41:0,39
I don't think my
mom has them even.


899
0:41:0,39 --> 0:41:2,8
It's very much an
experiential good.


900
0:41:2,8 --> 0:41:3,97
It's not a material good.


901
0:41:3,97 --> 0:41:6,86
It's not a kind of solid thing.


902
0:41:6,86 --> 0:41:10,77
And as a Millennial, in
terms of those three ideas,


903
0:41:10,77 --> 0:41:13,21
I don't actually think it
makes a difference what age


904
0:41:13,21 --> 0:41:15,5
or who you are.


905
0:41:15,5 --> 0:41:19,58
The simple aspect of it is,
if you want to be happier--


906
0:41:19,58 --> 0:41:20,926
And the research is fascinating.


907
0:41:20,926 --> 0:41:22,8
If you look at the
research that experiential


908
0:41:22,8 --> 0:41:23,716
versus material goods.


909
0:41:23,716 --> 0:41:25,69
There's one great example.


910
0:41:25,69 --> 0:41:29,74
People are happier, if they
talk about experiences.


911
0:41:29,74 --> 0:41:31,56
And we enjoy listening
to people that


912
0:41:31,56 --> 0:41:33,4
talk about experiences more.


913
0:41:33,4 --> 0:41:36,22
So on that basis, if
you've got a choice,


914
0:41:36,22 --> 0:41:38,5
you're feeling bored
on a Saturday morning,


915
0:41:38,5 --> 0:41:40,43
go spend your money and
time doing an experience.


916
0:41:40,43 --> 0:41:42,56
You'll be happier because
you'll be doing it.


917
0:41:42,56 --> 0:41:45,15
You'll be happier because when
you talk to people about it,


918
0:41:45,15 --> 0:41:46,219
you'll be happier.


919
0:41:46,219 --> 0:41:48,1
And you'll have more
friends because people


920
0:41:48,1 --> 0:41:49,81
will want to listen to you more.


921
0:41:49,81 --> 0:41:51,92
So an experiential good
is so much more positive.


922
0:41:51,92 --> 0:41:55,245
The other aspects about a
experiential good-- as opposed


923
0:41:55,245 --> 0:41:56,828
a material good--
have you ever bought


924
0:41:56,828 --> 0:41:59,79
a pair of shoes that squeak
when you walk in them?


925
0:41:59,79 --> 0:42:1,61
Or those trousers
that seem to swish?


926
0:42:1,61 --> 0:42:2,79
Or a coat.


927
0:42:2,79 --> 0:42:5,24
What do you do with those
shoes, or those things?


928
0:42:5,24 --> 0:42:6,88
You wear them but
they annoy you.


929
0:42:6,88 --> 0:42:8,6
You never want to wear them.


930
0:42:8,6 --> 0:42:11,9
Eventually, you throw them
away or do you just squeak?


931
0:42:11,9 --> 0:42:12,181
Maybe you do.


932
0:42:12,181 --> 0:42:14,68
The thing about a material good,
if you buy a material good,


933
0:42:14,68 --> 0:42:17,18
and it's not very good, there's
nothing you can do about it.


934
0:42:17,18 --> 0:42:18,74
You bought a bad good.


935
0:42:18,74 --> 0:42:19,72
That's it.


936
0:42:19,72 --> 0:42:22,99
If you have an experience
that goes wrong.


937
0:42:22,99 --> 0:42:24,459
The bus trip
across-- I was going


938
0:42:24,459 --> 0:42:26,25
to say a bus trip across
India [INAUDIBLE],


939
0:42:26,25 --> 0:42:27,8
but since that was
a fun bus trip.


940
0:42:27,8 --> 0:42:31,275
But the bus trip across
India-- or Peru, or Columbia,


941
0:42:31,275 --> 0:42:34,684
or Thailand where
it all goes wrong.


942
0:42:34,684 --> 0:42:36,1
Have you all been
on one of those?


943
0:42:36,1 --> 0:42:39,4
The person next to you was sick,
or some other unpleasant thing


944
0:42:39,4 --> 0:42:41,53
was happening, the
windows wouldn't shut


945
0:42:41,53 --> 0:42:43,73
or they wouldn't open,
it was too hot, too


946
0:42:43,73 --> 0:42:45,11
cold, you were sick.


947
0:42:45,11 --> 0:42:45,86
It all went wrong.


948
0:42:45,86 --> 0:42:48,6
It was supposed to take
2 hours, it took 3 days.


949
0:42:48,6 --> 0:42:50,71
Have you all been
one of those trips?


950
0:42:50,71 --> 0:42:53,31
And how bad was it at the time?


951
0:42:53,31 --> 0:42:55,76
And how amazing is it now?


952
0:42:55,76 --> 0:42:58,45
And that's the funny
thing about experiences.


953
0:42:58,45 --> 0:43:1,87
If you buy an experience,
and it's really bad,


954
0:43:1,87 --> 0:43:3,97
it's actually brilliant.


955
0:43:3,97 --> 0:43:6,94
So my advice to you would be
shift from material things


956
0:43:6,94 --> 0:43:8,652
to experiences.


957
0:43:8,652 --> 0:43:10,61
It has a lot of other
knock on effects as well.


958
0:43:10,61 --> 0:43:13,7
The environment, for example.


959
0:43:13,7 --> 0:43:14,562
But yeah, those are reasons.


960
0:43:14,562 --> 0:43:16,2
AUDIENCE: I'm
wondering how you not


961
0:43:16,2 --> 0:43:18,664
get stufficated by the
stuff of experience.


962
0:43:18,664 --> 0:43:20,83
So for example, if you go
skiing, you have the skis.


963
0:43:20,83 --> 0:43:22,399
You might have the scuba gear.


964
0:43:22,399 --> 0:43:23,44
You have the bread maker.


965
0:43:23,44 --> 0:43:25,196
You have all that stuff, right?


966
0:43:25,196 --> 0:43:26,57
Maybe you go to
Thailand, and you


967
0:43:26,57 --> 0:43:28,56
buy that beautiful painting,
but you went to Peru,


968
0:43:28,56 --> 0:43:29,893
and you bought this other thing.


969
0:43:29,893 --> 0:43:31,8
All of a sudden, your
house is full of stuff,


970
0:43:31,8 --> 0:43:33,554
but it's all related
to experience.


971
0:43:33,554 --> 0:43:34,97
So how do you not
get stufficated?


972
0:43:34,97 --> 0:43:36,859
JAMES WALLMAN: That
is a great question.


973
0:43:36,859 --> 0:43:38,65
It's funny, there's a
bit in the book where


974
0:43:38,65 --> 0:43:40,77
I, kind of, really take that on.


975
0:43:40,77 --> 0:43:43,559
There's a guy in the
book called Ben Howe.


976
0:43:43,559 --> 0:43:44,35
He's an Australian.


977
0:43:44,35 --> 0:43:48,21
If you go to his house in
Adelaide in South Australia,


978
0:43:48,21 --> 0:43:49,61
he's got a really regular house.


979
0:43:49,61 --> 0:43:53,879
If anything, it's not messy,
but it's not completed.


980
0:43:53,879 --> 0:43:55,67
You know, you walk into
your friend's house


981
0:43:55,67 --> 0:43:57,1
and sometimes think, how
long have you lived here?


982
0:43:57,1 --> 0:43:58,35
And you think
they've been a month,


983
0:43:58,35 --> 0:43:59,558
but they've been there years.


984
0:43:59,558 --> 0:44:2,11
It's kinda that.


985
0:44:2,11 --> 0:44:5,32
But you go to the garage,
and you put up the, kind of,


986
0:44:5,32 --> 0:44:8,16
rickety door, it's
full of stuff.


987
0:44:8,16 --> 0:44:10,64
He's got his motorbike in there,
he's got his kite surfing kit,


988
0:44:10,64 --> 0:44:13,223
he's got his wind surfing kit,
he's got his rock climbing kit,


989
0:44:13,223 --> 0:44:14,86
he's got his skiing kit.


990
0:44:14,86 --> 0:44:16,23
I'm not anti stuff.


991
0:44:16,23 --> 0:44:18,7
The message of stuffication
is not anti stuff,


992
0:44:18,7 --> 0:44:20,39
it's anti too much stuff.


993
0:44:20,39 --> 0:44:22,55
It's anti focus on stuff.


994
0:44:22,55 --> 0:44:24,8
I wish I mentioned the bread
maker because that really


995
0:44:24,8 --> 0:44:25,38
is stuff.


996
0:44:25,38 --> 0:44:28,8
But anyway, the smell of fresh
bread, it's a lovely thing.


997
0:44:28,8 --> 0:44:33,22
But if you want to ski, you
have to have things to do that.


998
0:44:33,22 --> 0:44:35,662
At the same time,
a walk in the park


999
0:44:35,662 --> 0:44:38,12
is an experience you can have
and don't need a lot of stuff


1000
0:44:38,12 --> 0:44:39,87
apart from feet.


1001
0:44:39,87 --> 0:44:42,36
And if you look at statistics,
if you live near a park,


1002
0:44:42,36 --> 0:44:44,42
you will be happier.


1003
0:44:44,42 --> 0:44:46,7
It's just one of those facts.


1004
0:44:46,7 --> 0:44:49,8
So and you mentioned going to
Peru and buying the painting,


1005
0:44:49,8 --> 0:44:50,972
you don't have to
buy that painting.


1006
0:44:50,972 --> 0:44:53,182
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].


1007
0:44:53,182 --> 0:44:56,87
JAMES WALLMAN: Well I've been
to Peru, I have no paintings.


1008
0:44:56,87 --> 0:44:59,64
[INAUDIBLE] No
paintings from Peru.


1009
0:44:59,64 --> 0:45:0,94
I have a couple of paintings.


1010
0:45:0,94 --> 0:45:4,73
But I remember it really
well-- I heard a howler monkey,


1011
0:45:4,73 --> 0:45:8,31
for example-- and this
was certainly in an era


1012
0:45:8,31 --> 0:45:10,83
before I had a telephone
that could record sounds--


1013
0:45:10,83 --> 0:45:15,13
but I can remember the sound
of that surreal howler monkey


1014
0:45:15,13 --> 0:45:17,24
to this day.


1015
0:45:17,24 --> 0:45:18,69
I hadn't talked about
that howler monkey


1016
0:45:18,69 --> 0:45:21,87
for about a decade, so thank you
for bringing that back to me.


1017
0:45:21,87 --> 0:45:24,41
But you don't need to have
stuff to have an experience.


1018
0:45:24,41 --> 0:45:27,534
Although, the two
sometimes come together.


1019
0:45:27,534 --> 0:45:29,45
AUDIENCE: Could there
be too many experiences?


1020
0:45:29,45 --> 0:45:32,68
To the point where
the value of them


1021
0:45:32,68 --> 0:45:34,82
is lessened because you're
doing so many things?


1022
0:45:34,82 --> 0:45:36,702
I think my life has
shifted in that way.


1023
0:45:36,702 --> 0:45:39,16
I don't have a car, I've lived
in so many different places,


1024
0:45:39,16 --> 0:45:40,6
so I could always purge.


1025
0:45:40,6 --> 0:45:43,72
And I'm always Tahoe
or Europe or whatever.


1026
0:45:43,72 --> 0:45:47,33
But maybe you're searching
for something big,


1027
0:45:47,33 --> 0:45:48,89
like bigger the next time.


1028
0:45:48,89 --> 0:45:51,649
Could it dull what's important
and what makes you happy?


1029
0:45:51,649 --> 0:45:52,69
JAMES WALLMAN: Thank you.


1030
0:45:52,69 --> 0:45:54,1
It's a really good
question as well.


1031
0:45:54,1 --> 0:45:56,26
And its really interesting
talking to people that move


1032
0:45:56,26 --> 0:45:56,99
country a lot.


1033
0:45:56,99 --> 0:46:0,41
They get this so quickly
because they do the country move


1034
0:46:0,41 --> 0:46:2,82
purge all the time.


1035
0:46:2,82 --> 0:46:5,37
And by definition of moving
from one country to another,


1036
0:46:5,37 --> 0:46:7,0
they're appreciating
the experience


1037
0:46:7,0 --> 0:46:7,61
of going to another country.


1038
0:46:7,61 --> 0:46:9,859
They tend to be more interested
in this kind of thing.


1039
0:46:9,859 --> 0:46:12,24



1040
0:46:12,24 --> 0:46:15,63
And I've spent a couple ski
seasons in the mountains.


1041
0:46:15,63 --> 0:46:18,16
At the end of five months
of being at a ski resort--


1042
0:46:18,16 --> 0:46:21,74
I have to be honest-- it sort
of loses some of its fizz,


1043
0:46:21,74 --> 0:46:23,4
compared to right
at the beginning.


1044
0:46:23,4 --> 0:46:29,98
And for someone who's
got so many experiences,


1045
0:46:29,98 --> 0:46:32,26
that your signs get
dulled by experiences,


1046
0:46:32,26 --> 0:46:34,31
that is a great problem to have.


1047
0:46:34,31 --> 0:46:35,45
Let's be really clear here.


1048
0:46:35,45 --> 0:46:40,1
Stuffication is a
fantastic problem to have.


1049
0:46:40,1 --> 0:46:43,94
Scarcity-- not having enough--
is a horrible problem to have,


1050
0:46:43,94 --> 0:46:44,917
actually.


1051
0:46:44,917 --> 0:46:47,0
And I'm not saying this
for everyone in the world.


1052
0:46:47,0 --> 0:46:49,63
This is for rich,
Western countries.


1053
0:46:49,63 --> 0:46:52,36
Other countries don't
have nearly the abundance


1054
0:46:52,36 --> 0:46:56,619
that we have per capita,
but as a whole country.


1055
0:46:56,619 --> 0:46:58,41
So stuffication is a
great problem to have.


1056
0:46:58,41 --> 0:47:3,3
If you get to the point where
you've done wind walking,


1057
0:47:3,3 --> 0:47:8,18
you've flown in helicopters,
you've been skiing in Kashmir,


1058
0:47:8,18 --> 0:47:10,87
you've spent time with monkeys,
whatever it might be, right?


1059
0:47:10,87 --> 0:47:12,995
If you've got to the point
where you're stufficated


1060
0:47:12,995 --> 0:47:16,75
with experience, are you saying
you're at that point now?


1061
0:47:16,75 --> 0:47:19,88
Because I'd say that is an
amazing problem to have.


1062
0:47:19,88 --> 0:47:26,35



1063
0:47:26,35 --> 0:47:28,14
The thing is as well
here, is that there's


1064
0:47:28,14 --> 0:47:31,96
an element of the material
versus the experiential choice,


1065
0:47:31,96 --> 0:47:34,49
being a first level
heuristic-- a kind


1066
0:47:34,49 --> 0:47:37,36
of simple way of making the
right choice-- because one


1067
0:47:37,36 --> 0:47:41,32
of the key things about this
actually is, is it extrinsic


1068
0:47:41,32 --> 0:47:42,64
or is it intrinsic?


1069
0:47:42,64 --> 0:47:44,9
In terms of how you
make the decision.


1070
0:47:44,9 --> 0:47:49,25
So if you buy material
good for yourself--


1071
0:47:49,25 --> 0:47:51,96
So I'm not trying to show off
to you about my break maker.


1072
0:47:51,96 --> 0:47:54,97
I really mean that-- I'm buying
the bread maker because we


1073
0:47:54,97 --> 0:47:56,58
discussed it and
we think we will


1074
0:47:56,58 --> 0:47:58,154
enjoy having that experience.


1075
0:47:58,154 --> 0:48:0,7
And fresh bread is really
expensive in London,


1076
0:48:0,7 --> 0:48:1,769
by the way.


1077
0:48:1,769 --> 0:48:3,56
I don't want to fixate
on this bread maker.


1078
0:48:3,56 --> 0:48:5,11
But we the decision for us.


1079
0:48:5,11 --> 0:48:8,17
We're not doing as an extrinsic
thing to say, hey, look at us,


1080
0:48:8,17 --> 0:48:9,796
we bought a bread maker.


1081
0:48:9,796 --> 0:48:11,67
And it can be the with
same with experiences.


1082
0:48:11,67 --> 0:48:13,29
You know those
people who will go


1083
0:48:13,29 --> 0:48:15,31
to the place to go on holiday.


1084
0:48:15,31 --> 0:48:17,632
They'll read a magazine and
go that's the place I have


1085
0:48:17,632 --> 0:48:19,9
to go on holiday
because then I can


1086
0:48:19,9 --> 0:48:20,704
tell people I've been there.


1087
0:48:20,704 --> 0:48:21,62
You know these people?


1088
0:48:21,62 --> 0:48:24,67
You all have friends like
that, or acquaintances?


1089
0:48:24,67 --> 0:48:26,93
You don't get as
much pleasure if you


1090
0:48:26,93 --> 0:48:30,79
buy that experiential good
for an extrinsic reason,


1091
0:48:30,79 --> 0:48:33,7
than if you buy it for
an intrinsic reason.


1092
0:48:33,7 --> 0:48:37,1
But-- and this is why I like
the distinction between material


1093
0:48:37,1 --> 0:48:39,72
and experiential
decisions-- even if you


1094
0:48:39,72 --> 0:48:44,73
buy that experiential good
to show off to other people--


1095
0:48:44,73 --> 0:48:47,69
to tell people who you are other
than doing it for yourself--


1096
0:48:47,69 --> 0:48:49,82
you'll still be
doing that thing.


1097
0:48:49,82 --> 0:48:52,21
Let's say you
decided that you have


1098
0:48:52,21 --> 0:48:54,41
to ski in Squaw Valley--
for the sake of argument--


1099
0:48:54,41 --> 0:48:55,65
now there's snow
there, you've decided


1100
0:48:55,65 --> 0:48:57,858
that you have to do that so
you can tell your friends


1101
0:48:57,858 --> 0:48:58,85
you've done it.


1102
0:48:58,85 --> 0:49:1,44
You'll still be skiing
in Squaw Valley.


1103
0:49:1,44 --> 0:49:2,54
Do you see what I mean?


1104
0:49:2,54 --> 0:49:4,609
So that's why I think
that distinction works.


1105
0:49:4,609 --> 0:49:7,15
But if you get to that point
the stufficate with experiences,


1106
0:49:7,15 --> 0:49:8,59
let's definitely talk.


1107
0:49:8,59 --> 0:49:12,25
AUDIENCE: Isn't the risk
that we are replacing


1108
0:49:12,25 --> 0:49:14,32
one problem with just another?


1109
0:49:14,32 --> 0:49:20,28
With stuffing our lives with
experiences and actually,


1110
0:49:20,28 --> 0:49:24,27
our time is much more limited
than this pace we have.


1111
0:49:24,27 --> 0:49:30,5
So is it a better way to
live your life actually,


1112
0:49:30,5 --> 0:49:34,6
or should we actually look
for even another answer.


1113
0:49:34,6 --> 0:49:39,21
Make time to think and not
just to get our experiences


1114
0:49:39,21 --> 0:49:43,229
going for holidays, new
restaurants, and so on.


1115
0:49:43,229 --> 0:49:45,2
JAMES WALLMAN: It's a
really good question.


1116
0:49:45,2 --> 0:49:47,29
Thank you.


1117
0:49:47,29 --> 0:49:49,6
Often when I'm
explaining this-- and I


1118
0:49:49,6 --> 0:49:55,46
give a talk on this-- I tend to
talk about things that you do,


1119
0:49:55,46 --> 0:49:56,29
actively do.


1120
0:49:56,29 --> 0:49:58,51
Because probably, it's
easier to visualize,


1121
0:49:58,51 --> 0:50:0,77
and it makes it a bit more
interesting to listen to.


1122
0:50:0,77 --> 0:50:5,9
But sitting, thinking
is an experience,


1123
0:50:5,9 --> 0:50:6,57
as far as I'm concerned.


1124
0:50:6,57 --> 0:50:9,7
And I don't think
that we're replacing


1125
0:50:9,7 --> 0:50:11,69
one problem with another.


1126
0:50:11,69 --> 0:50:13,36
I think we're replacing one
problem with something that


1127
0:50:13,36 --> 0:50:15,67
is exponentially better.


1128
0:50:15,67 --> 0:50:19,62
And I agree with you that
we only have so much time.


1129
0:50:19,62 --> 0:50:22,49
Experiences take time.


1130
0:50:22,49 --> 0:50:24,6
But that's life.


1131
0:50:24,6 --> 0:50:26,389
And the choice of
experiences that you do


1132
0:50:26,389 --> 0:50:28,555
are the choice of what you
do with your time, that's


1133
0:50:28,555 --> 0:50:29,971
what you do with
your life, right?


1134
0:50:29,971 --> 0:50:35,86
As opposed to you're saying that
there's more space for stuff


1135
0:50:35,86 --> 0:50:38,59
and therefore, we should
spend money on stuff


1136
0:50:38,59 --> 0:50:41,2
because we've got lots of space.


1137
0:50:41,2 --> 0:50:44,65
If you look at demographics and
the urbanization of the world,


1138
0:50:44,65 --> 0:50:45,754
we have less space.


1139
0:50:45,754 --> 0:50:48,17
There's seven billion people
now, it might be nine billion


1140
0:50:48,17 --> 0:50:51,2
by 2050.


1141
0:50:51,2 --> 0:50:53,28
More people living in
cities, less space.


1142
0:50:53,28 --> 0:50:55,203
So I think we have
less space, but I


1143
0:50:55,203 --> 0:50:59,159
think the most important part
of your question was about time.


1144
0:50:59,159 --> 0:51:0,7
The other thing
about experientialism


1145
0:51:0,7 --> 0:51:4,5
is a focus on what
you do with your time.


1146
0:51:4,5 --> 0:51:5,76
It's about your experiences.


1147
0:51:5,76 --> 0:51:7,51
And what could be more
important than what


1148
0:51:7,51 --> 0:51:10,7
you do with your time, as
opposed to the stuff you buy?


1149
0:51:10,7 --> 0:51:16,58
So in terms of the refocus from
material things to experiences,


1150
0:51:16,58 --> 0:51:18,88
I think there's a refocus
on life and what matters.


1151
0:51:18,88 --> 0:51:20,68
AUDIENCE: My
question is about how


1152
0:51:20,68 --> 0:51:25,58
do you with people becoming
less and less materialistic--


1153
0:51:25,58 --> 0:51:31,72
compared to even 40 years
ago, as Mr. Inglehart said--


1154
0:51:31,72 --> 0:51:34,51
how do you think it's going
to influence job market?


1155
0:51:34,51 --> 0:51:37,76
Because not all of
us can make a living


1156
0:51:37,76 --> 0:51:39,92
writing programs
or writing books.


1157
0:51:39,92 --> 0:51:44,9
Some of us, for example,
enjoy creating stuff.


1158
0:51:44,9 --> 0:51:45,559
Sewing or something like that.


1159
0:51:45,559 --> 0:51:47,35
So if we're going to
be less materialistic,


1160
0:51:47,35 --> 0:51:49,85
is that going to become
a problem for people


1161
0:51:49,85 --> 0:51:53,83
who are making their
living producing stuff


1162
0:51:53,83 --> 0:51:57,175
and selling stuff?


1163
0:51:57,175 --> 0:51:59,86
JAMES WALLMAN: It's a
very interesting aspect


1164
0:51:59,86 --> 0:52:4,96
of the problem of materialism
and the defining problem


1165
0:52:4,96 --> 0:52:5,71
stuffication.


1166
0:52:5,71 --> 0:52:8,56
The shift from the material
to experiential economy


1167
0:52:8,56 --> 0:52:11,83
is what's going to happen
to some industries.


1168
0:52:11,83 --> 0:52:15,43
With any change, there are
winners and there are losers.


1169
0:52:15,43 --> 0:52:18,63
You ever heard of a guy called
Ned Ludd, who led the Luddites?


1170
0:52:18,63 --> 0:52:20,24
Ever heard the
phrase, the Luddites?


1171
0:52:20,24 --> 0:52:23,18
So when the Industrial
Revolution got going in the UK,


1172
0:52:23,18 --> 0:52:27,9
this guy in the north of England
smashed some of the machines.


1173
0:52:27,9 --> 0:52:28,84
He may have just been
drunk-- it turns out


1174
0:52:28,84 --> 0:52:30,877
he may have not been
protesting at all.


1175
0:52:30,877 --> 0:52:32,96
Apparently, if you look
into it, it's really odd--


1176
0:52:32,96 --> 0:52:34,71
but he became their
hero and they and they


1177
0:52:34,71 --> 0:52:37,22
called themselves Luddites
because those machines were


1178
0:52:37,22 --> 0:52:41,104
taking away their jobs, and
they were hugely concerned.


1179
0:52:41,104 --> 0:52:42,77
Did that stop the
Industrial Revolution?


1180
0:52:42,77 --> 0:52:43,22
No.


1181
0:52:43,22 --> 0:52:45,261
Should it have stopped
the Industrial Revolution?


1182
0:52:45,261 --> 0:52:45,81
Not at all.


1183
0:52:45,81 --> 0:52:47,685
Because it was the
Industrial Revolution that


1184
0:52:47,685 --> 0:52:51,36
led to the consumer evolution
that gave us abundance,


1185
0:52:51,36 --> 0:52:54,2
that gave us everything
that we have today.


1186
0:52:54,2 --> 0:52:56,99
So there will definitely be
changes in the job market.


1187
0:52:56,99 --> 0:53:0,51
And definitely be changes
in terms of what we value.


1188
0:53:0,51 --> 0:53:2,472
And I think it will
change for the better.


1189
0:53:2,472 --> 0:53:3,93
You think about 3D
printing, what's


1190
0:53:3,93 --> 0:53:8,61
3D printing going to do for all
those people who make stuff?


1191
0:53:8,61 --> 0:53:11,4
When you can 3D
print it at home,


1192
0:53:11,4 --> 0:53:13,38
it's going to completely
change that market, isn't it?


1193
0:53:13,38 --> 0:53:16,21
Why you going to have loads of
factories of people producing


1194
0:53:16,21 --> 0:53:19,68
plastic goods, when you
can print it at home?


1195
0:53:19,68 --> 0:53:22,5
So the world is
changing, anyway.


1196
0:53:22,5 --> 0:53:28,1
And what I'm hoping-- this is
my belief-- what materialism


1197
0:53:28,1 --> 0:53:31,35
did for standards of living
in the 20th century, which


1198
0:53:31,35 --> 0:53:34,12
was just revolutionized them
in a way that just had never


1199
0:53:34,12 --> 0:53:36,2
happened in the whole
of human existence.


1200
0:53:36,2 --> 0:53:40,3
I think experientialism could
do that for quality of life


1201
0:53:40,3 --> 0:53:41,92
in the 21st century.


1202
0:53:41,92 --> 0:53:43,81
We could end up in
this age of leisure,


1203
0:53:43,81 --> 0:53:46,84
which [INAUDIBLE] talked
about back in the '30s.


1204
0:53:46,84 --> 0:53:47,931
That's what I hope.


1205
0:53:47,931 --> 0:53:48,43
SPEAKER: OK.


1206
0:53:48,43 --> 0:53:51,57
Why don't we thank
our speaker today.


1207
0:53:51,57 --> 0:55:51,57
