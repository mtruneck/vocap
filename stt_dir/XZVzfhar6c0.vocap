###9 -Mm.

###23 BROOKS HEADLEY: I'm Brooks Headley.
###24 I'm the pastry chef at Del Posto in Manhattan.
###28 I kind of approach cooking and food the same way that I would
###32 approach being in a punk band.
###35 The way that I would figure out drum parts to a Born Again
###38 song, or a [INAUDIBLE] song.
###40 For cooking it's the same way.
###41 I'm not inventing new techniques or anything, but I
###44 feel like I'm taking from different styles of food--
###47 really, really simple stuff, like almost stupid stuff and
###52 that's good.
###54 That's like a good punk song-- it should be stupid, and it
###57 should be direct, and it should just
###59 be almost like duh.
###60 
###70 I'm here with Michael Laiskonis, a pastry chef from
###73 Le Bernardin.
###74 And we are headed to Williamsburg to go to Sal's
###78 Pizza, my favorite pizza place in the world.
###80 
###84 MICHAEL LAISKONIS: I actually think I met you as a pastry
###86 chef first, right?
###87 BROOKS HEADLEY: Yeah.
###88 MICHAEL LAISKONIS: And then years later realized we had
###90 this sort of common interest in punk rock, underground
###95 music scene.
###96 And realized probably 20 years ago that there was a good
###99 chance we were in the same room.
###100 BROOKS HEADLEY: Working in a kitchen is kind of like being
###103 on tour, but being on tour your whole life.
###106 Because it's something that completely controls everything
###111 that you do.
###112 
###115 When I think of pizza in New York, I think of this place.
###119 
###123 Can we get a grandma to go?
###125 
###129 I lived basically around the corner from Sal's for the
###132 first four years that I lived in New York, so
###135 it became my spot.
###137 It was comfort food and super old school.
###142 Real New York City pizza.
###144 MICHAEL LAISKONIS: Last time I was at Del Posto I actually
###146 was sent home with a pizza.
###147 But it was a dessert pizza, but he sent it out in a pizza
###151 box as we were leaving, so that was pretty hot.
###154 BROOKS HEADLEY: Anytime I can get pizza in there.
###157 But I actually went to the place around the corner and I
###159 was like, hey, I want to buy one pizza box.
###162 And the guy's like what are you talking about?
###163 I find a lot of inspiration in pizza in general.
###167 Whenever I can compare it, or when I find that comparison in
###171 my head and it kind of works out on the plate at Del Posto,
###174 it just cracks me up.
###175 Because I'm like oh, yeah, this is pizza, you know.
###178 Sometimes it drives me a little crazy that pastry chefs
###181 or people that make desserts, they sort of have blinders on.
###185 And they're only thinking about sugar or specific cakes
###189 or cookies or something.
###190 For me, the thing that I'd want to do is cook a bunch of
###195 vegetables.
###196 So you're still thinking in terms of different flavors,
###199 sweet and salty and bitter and sour, just to
###205 highlight the product.
###207 And that's such an Italian thing to do.
###211 -[INAUDIBLE]
###211 Sicilian, regular pizza, you got plates.
###213 BROOKS HEADLEY: Great.
###214 Thanks, man.
###215 -All right?
###215 OK, have a nice day.
###216 BROOKS HEADLEY: Yeah.
###217 
###219 So we got some pizza.
###221 Now we're going over to the Momofuku Milk Bar, bakery,
###226 complex, airplane hangar spot.
###229 
###244 Yeah, Christina Tosi who is the master dessert pastry
###253 person for all of the Momofuku restaurants and just one of my
###256 favorite people-- she's hilarious.
###257 Has a commissary basically in Williamsburg where they make
###261 everything for all the different restaurants and all
###264 their mail order and stuff.
###265 Her crack pie became world famous, which is awesome,
###270 hilarious, and totally cool.
###271 
###282 CHRISTINA TOSI: Come, I'll give you the rest of the tour.
###286 It's my pride and joy.
###287 I named her Beyonce and painted her gold.
###289 BROOKS HEADLEY: Excellent.
###291 Did you not have a sheeter before?
###292 CHRISTINA TOSI: No, we were rolling everything by hand.
###295 We were making all these croissants at one point, it
###297 was like compound butter.
###298 And it was just getting to the point that I was just like, no
###300 one's ever going to roll fast enough.
###301 You know what I mean?
###304 -So this is our office.
###306 BROOKS HEADLEY: Whose dogs are these?
###307 -These are Tosi's dogs.
###310 BROOKS HEADLEY: Dogs in the kitchen, is that a violation?
###312 -We don't let the dogs [INAUDIBLE], that's why they
###314 only ever live [INAUDIBLE].
###315 CHRISTINA TOSI: Are you guys going anywhere after this?
###318 BROOKS HEADLEY: Yeah, we're going back to Del Posto.
###320 MICHAEL LAISKONIS: Am I working tonight?
###321 BROOKS HEADLEY: No, no.
###323 You're going to sit down and relax.
###326 I'm going to put on the paper hat.
###329 
###337 Well basically at that point we went and got some pizza.
###343 We got the grandma slice.
###344 Hung out with the ladies at Milk Bar.
###347 And then the only responsible thing to do at that point
###351 would be to go back to Del Posto and eat some vegetables.
###355 I just wanted to invite some people that I know, some
###359 through food and some through music.
###361 Who was there?
###362 Rick was there, Amelia was there, Erin was
###366 there, Tonie was there.
###369 That I knew would appreciate eating a bunch of vegetables.
###373 So there's plenty to drink out there if
###376 anybody needs anything.
###378 -Are there painkillers?
###379 Because I am--
###380 TONIE JOY: Probably behind you.
###381 --Seriously need a break.
###384 MICHAEL LAISKONIS: I booked shows at a place [INAUDIBLE]
###387 and they ended up playing a year after I stopped.
###390 -I won't send you away.
###392 MICHAEL LAISKONIS: I'm OK.
###393 Awesome.
###395 
###396 We geek out over both pastry and punk rock, I guess.
###400 BROOKS HEADLEY: So listen you guys, I'm going to go make us
###402 some vegetables, all right?
###403 -All right.
###403 -Oh, yeah.
###404 -I hope they're good.
###405 BROOKS HEADLEY: They better?
###406 Yeah, really?
###406 All right.
###407 
###417 To me, vegetables are totally sacred.
###421 When I was in bands 15 years ago, that's all we did was
###426 talk about and think about vegetarian food and veganism
###429 and whatever.
###430 So this is a butternut squash and apple salad.
###435 And then this is just ricotta with salt and pepper.
###439 Olive oil, roasted cauliflower with olives and capers, so a
###444 total Mark Latimer classic.
###447 Chickpeas and leeks, basically.
###449 And the leeks are sweated down so they're totally sweet.
###452 
###458 -Are you saying we're ready?
###459 BROOKS HEADLEY: I think so, yeah.
###460 
###474 -You have wine, liquor and beer in front of you.
###478 -Listen, I came to party.
###482 BROOKS HEADLEY: So this is a Anuloti with a Lambrusco
###485 sauce.
###485 -Oh, there's more?
###486 BROOKS HEADLEY: Speck, it's got meat in it, so I made you
###488 a special one--
###490 pasta with butter, for the babies.
###494 
###503 -Are we really not getting any dessert?
###505 BROOKS HEADLEY: No, you're going to get some dessert,
###507 Obviously, the pastry chef has to make some
###510 sort of dessert, right?
###512 I mean, I'm sort of a contrarian deep to the core.
###516 So I had no desire to showboat and make a bunch of desserts--
###522 oh, look at me, look at what I can do.
###524 This is great, look at this, this is great.
###526 So I made, obviously, the most simple, almost silly, Italian
###532 dessert, which is tiramisu.
###533 The first place I ever worked, we made individual ones and
###536 then we would put a candle in that.
###538 But it had cocoa powder on top, so when people would blow
###542 out the candle it would like--
###543 
###547 I am full-on, 100% a restaurant pastry chef.
###552 And even more specifically than that, Del Posto.
###554 If you dumped me in another kitchen in Manhattan, at
###559 another three or four star restaurant, I'd
###562 probably get fired.
###562 Because I exist specifically to do one
###566 specific style of food.
###569 Complicated doesn't necessarily equal delicious.
###573 To a bunch of fucking vegetables.
###575 -Yeah.
###577 I love it.
###578 Thank you, Brooks.
###579 -Thank you so much.
###580 -Thank you very much.
###581 
###583 CHRISTINA TOSI: We are well-fed, thank you.
###585
