1
0:0:2,407 --> 0:0:7,727
Do you know what
l want to do to you tonight?


2
0:0:7,727 --> 0:0:10,47
- You didn't say anything.
- l know.


3
0:0:10,47 --> 0:0:12,647
lt was gonna be kinky,
and l got embarrassed.


4
0:0:12,647 --> 0:0:16,247
Really kinky?
Was l a bad girl?


5
0:0:16,247 --> 0:0:23,367
Very bad. You had to go
to the principal's office.


6
0:0:23,367 --> 0:0:26,287
l have an early shift tomorrow.


7
0:0:26,287 --> 0:0:28,807
- l've got to sleep.
- Want me to take you home?


8
0:0:28,807 --> 0:0:32,287
No. But if we're gonna pick up
a schoolgirl outfit and have sex,


9
0:0:32,287 --> 0:0:34,367
we have to leave this minute.


10
0:0:34,367 --> 0:0:38,127
<i>One of the best things about</i>
<i>women is they're unpredictable,</i>


11
0:0:38,127 --> 0:0:40,287
<i>Of course</i>
<i>that can bite you in the ass,</i>


12
0:0:40,287 --> 0:0:42,927
Boink.
Who's your new friend?


13
0:0:42,927 --> 0:0:45,887
Look, it got a letter.


14
0:0:45,887 --> 0:0:49,7
So l put on a few pounds.


15
0:0:49,7 --> 0:0:52,47
But how would you like it
if somebody did this to you?


16
0:0:52,47 --> 0:0:54,47
l wouldn't.


17
0:0:54,47 --> 0:0:56,647
- l don't think it's fair.
- lt isn't fair.


18
0:0:56,647 --> 0:0:59,367
- Now, eat your doughnut.
- Eat your doughnut.


19
0:0:59,367 --> 0:1:2,767
<i>And I was having problems</i>
<i>with my lady too,</i>


20
0:1:2,767 --> 0:1:7,687
Get a move on. l got tickets to
<i>Bring in 'Da Noise Bring in 'Da Funk,</i>


21
0:1:7,687 --> 0:1:10,167
We're gonna take blood so we can check


22
0:1:10,167 --> 0:1:22,567
your hepatitis viral load.
Absolutely no big deal.


23
0:1:22,567 --> 0:1:24,167
<i>No big deal at all,</i>


24
0:1:24,167 --> 0:1:40,727
Could somebody get that?


25
0:1:40,727 --> 0:1:43,327
These tests
are gonna come back negative.


26
0:1:43,327 --> 0:1:46,927
Everybody who works
in a hospital eventually gets stuck.


27
0:1:46,927 --> 0:1:48,767
Thanks for being so nice to me.


28
0:1:48,767 --> 0:1:51,367
Who wouldn't be nice to you right now?


29
0:1:51,367 --> 0:1:55,247
l understand you might need
a refresher course in hospital safety.


30
0:1:55,247 --> 0:1:58,7
This is a syringe.
When filled with infected blood,


31
0:1:58,7 --> 0:2:1,607
where is the last place
you might want to stick it?


32
0:2:1,607 --> 0:2:5,7
- ln my arm.
- Very good, Dr Dorian.


33
0:2:5,7 --> 0:2:8,127
Mr Sarcastic strikes again.


34
0:2:8,127 --> 0:2:11,287
For God's sake, sir, just fire me.


35
0:2:11,287 --> 0:2:15,407
Just get him to sign the damn paper.


36
0:2:15,407 --> 0:2:16,807
What's this?


37
0:2:16,807 --> 0:2:21,207
lf you develop any symptoms that suggest
you may have contracted hepatitis B,


38
0:2:21,207 --> 0:2:24,607
this form states
the hospital is not responsible.


39
0:2:24,607 --> 0:2:27,407
Thanks. That's comforting.


40
0:2:27,407 --> 0:2:29,527
l'm sure you'll be fine.


41
0:2:29,527 --> 0:2:32,247
Here's your pen.


42
0:2:32,247 --> 0:2:41,567
Keep it.


43
0:2:41,567 --> 0:2:43,647
ls he gonna make it?


44
0:2:43,647 --> 0:2:53,287
- Doesn't look good.
- Yay!


45
0:2:53,287 --> 0:2:57,7
lsn't that what you were wearing
when you left last night?


46
0:2:57,7 --> 0:2:59,87
<i>The walk of shame,</i>


47
0:2:59,87 --> 0:3:4,327
<i>All you can hope for is a supportive</i>
<i>friend to help you get through it,</i>


48
0:3:4,327 --> 0:3:9,167
<i>Elliot got some booty</i>


49
0:3:9,167 --> 0:3:10,927
Stop it.


50
0:3:10,927 --> 0:3:16,687
What? lt's my
''Elliot got some booty'' dance.


51
0:3:16,687 --> 0:3:20,647
Elliot,
it's not like anybody else knows.


52
0:3:20,647 --> 0:3:26,327
- What's up, porn star?
- Somebody toasted that marshmallow.


53
0:3:26,327 --> 0:3:29,167
Well?


54
0:3:29,167 --> 0:3:34,527
<i>Somebody got some action</i>


55
0:3:34,527 --> 0:3:36,447
Come on. lt's funny.


56
0:3:36,447 --> 0:3:40,7
l can't find my scrubs top.
l must've left it at Sean's.


57
0:3:40,7 --> 0:3:42,207
<i>The curse of the scrubs machine,</i>


58
0:3:42,207 --> 0:3:44,807
<i>One of the hospital's</i>
<i>annoying money savers,</i>


59
0:3:44,807 --> 0:3:48,287
<i>The only way to get clean scrubs out</i>
<i>is to put dirty ones in,</i>


60
0:3:48,287 --> 0:3:50,567
- How can l help?
- Give me your shirt.


61
0:3:50,567 --> 0:4:4,647
- How else can l help?
- Just go.


62
0:4:4,647 --> 0:4:7,247
Good morning, sir.


63
0:4:7,247 --> 0:4:10,607
And yet another
proud day for Dr Reid.


64
0:4:10,607 --> 0:4:14,327
l'd say it can only get better,
but we both know that isn't true.


65
0:4:14,327 --> 0:4:16,607
Right, sweetheart?


66
0:4:16,607 --> 0:4:20,327
Yeah.


67
0:4:20,327 --> 0:4:22,367
You know l'm crazy in love with you.


68
0:4:22,367 --> 0:4:25,487
Don't tell me you're obsessing
over a joke l made.


69
0:4:25,487 --> 0:4:27,727
- l'm not obsessing.
- Good.


70
0:4:27,727 --> 0:4:29,967
Careful. l just might eat you.


71
0:4:29,967 --> 0:4:33,967
l see it all the time: The long hours,
the stress eating, no exercise.


72
0:4:33,967 --> 0:4:36,447
There's not a doctor here
who's in shape.


73
0:4:36,447 --> 0:4:43,87
Nothing better than a good sweat.


74
0:4:43,87 --> 0:4:46,47
Turk! lt was a joke!


75
0:4:46,47 --> 0:4:48,87
Alrighty.


76
0:4:48,87 --> 0:4:50,7
What do we have here?


77
0:4:50,7 --> 0:4:53,767
What you've got here are four cases
of Legionnaires' pneumonia.


78
0:4:53,767 --> 0:4:56,407
So l would start us out
on lV aminoglycosides.


79
0:4:56,407 --> 0:4:59,87
Check for urinary legionella antigen.


80
0:4:59,87 --> 0:5:2,847
lt could be viral, considering
my gastrointestinal situation.


81
0:5:2,847 --> 0:5:4,687
Here comes the fart joke.


82
0:5:4,687 --> 0:5:7,47
l think l may have strep pneumo.


83
0:5:7,47 --> 0:5:12,727
- All four of us are doctors.
- Let me guess. Golf cart accident?


84
0:5:12,727 --> 0:5:15,687
- Playing.
- Medical convention.


85
0:5:15,687 --> 0:5:19,47
So, what's with
the antecubital venipuncture?


86
0:5:19,47 --> 0:5:22,967
l got hit with
of one of my hep B patients' syringes.


87
0:5:22,967 --> 0:5:26,407
l once had a colleague
who got bit by a patient with rabies.


88
0:5:26,407 --> 0:5:28,807
- He's OK, right?
- No, he died.


89
0:5:28,807 --> 0:5:31,327
A friend from med school
contracted leprosy.


90
0:5:31,327 --> 0:5:34,407
They amputated one of his toes.
Popped it right off.


91
0:5:34,407 --> 0:5:36,927
But hepatitis. Scary stuff.


92
0:5:36,927 --> 0:5:40,567
- l'll be OK.
- Maybe.


93
0:5:40,567 --> 0:5:49,167
l have to go check on a thing...


94
0:5:49,167 --> 0:5:56,687
To interns.


95
0:5:56,687 --> 0:6:0,167
- We cannot have intercourse tonight.
- Stop calling it that.


96
0:6:0,167 --> 0:6:3,247
l'm falling so behind
on my reading, and l really...


97
0:6:3,247 --> 0:6:5,847
Don't always assume
l wanna be fooling around.


98
0:6:5,847 --> 0:6:9,7
Sometimes l'm happy just
thinking about fooling around.


99
0:6:9,7 --> 0:6:12,167
Why can't couples just be together?


100
0:6:12,167 --> 0:6:15,127
- Why is it always about sex?
- Yes, Sean.


101
0:6:15,127 --> 0:6:20,447
Freud said 90%  of all human behaviour
is motivated by sexual impulses.


102
0:6:20,447 --> 0:6:23,367
30%  of my behaviour
is motivated by advertising,


103
0:6:23,367 --> 0:6:25,487
and the rest by violence in film.


104
0:6:25,487 --> 0:6:31,567
For me it's 98%  getting my dad
to love me, 2%  chocolate.


105
0:6:31,567 --> 0:6:41,367
Now, you have to stop talking to me
so l can get some work done.


106
0:6:41,367 --> 0:6:44,7
Say it.


107
0:6:44,7 --> 0:6:49,727
lntercourse.


108
0:6:49,727 --> 0:6:53,47
Way to get your burger on.


109
0:6:53,47 --> 0:6:56,447
Just exactly what in the hell is this?


110
0:6:56,447 --> 0:6:58,527
l need to talk to you.


111
0:6:58,527 --> 0:7:4,367
Dr Cox, l haven't had a chance
to tell you this yet. Your name rocks!


112
0:7:4,367 --> 0:7:6,327
Come on!


113
0:7:6,327 --> 0:7:9,447
This conversation stops
until cabana boy here goes.


114
0:7:9,447 --> 0:7:11,407
- He's not the boss of me.
- Todd.


115
0:7:11,407 --> 0:7:14,727
Cool.


116
0:7:14,727 --> 0:7:17,567
So how do you do it?
How do you stay in shape?


117
0:7:17,567 --> 0:7:20,367
Discipline.
Some of us work on our appearance.


118
0:7:20,367 --> 0:7:23,527
Could l work out with you some time?


119
0:7:23,527 --> 0:7:26,47
l don't know about that.


120
0:7:26,47 --> 0:7:29,207
l'm not particularly fond of you,
although


121
0:7:29,207 --> 0:7:32,767
it might be fun to see you
flail about for a couple of days.


122
0:7:32,767 --> 0:7:35,247
You know what?
Forget about it.


123
0:7:35,247 --> 0:7:37,807
You see that guy there?


124
0:7:37,807 --> 0:7:42,207
That's you in five years.


125
0:7:42,207 --> 0:7:43,807
You in ten years.


126
0:7:43,807 --> 0:7:45,887
And guess what, He-Man?


127
0:7:45,887 --> 0:7:49,167
You in 20.


128
0:7:49,167 --> 0:7:52,47
l'm in.


129
0:7:52,47 --> 0:7:59,87
<i>I won't let those doctors scare me,</i>
<i>I always get right back on the horse,</i>


130
0:7:59,87 --> 0:8:3,487
l'm so sorry you're alone, Mr Winston,
but meningococcus is highly contagious.


131
0:8:3,487 --> 0:8:7,7
- l don't have anyone to talk to.
- Good news, friend.


132
0:8:7,7 --> 0:8:9,807
The doctor is in.


133
0:8:9,807 --> 0:8:14,567
l asked for a newspaper, and they gave
me Judy Blume books from Paediatrics.


134
0:8:14,567 --> 0:8:17,327
l don't know anything about those.


135
0:8:17,327 --> 0:8:19,647
Read <i>Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing,</i>


136
0:8:19,647 --> 0:8:23,127
Completely turned
high school around for me.


137
0:8:23,127 --> 0:8:26,567
<i>You see? Nobody keeps</i>
<i>John Dorian from moving on,</i>


138
0:8:26,567 --> 0:8:30,727
<i>Nobody,</i>


139
0:8:30,727 --> 0:8:34,247
We've replaced this doctor's blood
with hepatitis blood.


140
0:8:34,247 --> 0:8:36,167
Let's see if he notices.


141
0:8:36,167 --> 0:8:41,567
l could be really sick here.
Could you be nice for once?


142
0:8:41,567 --> 0:8:43,527
How's that?


143
0:8:43,527 --> 0:8:47,727
l have not been this happy
since, well, ever.


144
0:8:47,727 --> 0:8:50,367
Don't you think Sean and l
are a great couple?


145
0:8:50,367 --> 0:8:53,567
l don't know Sean,
and you've never spoken to me before.


146
0:8:53,567 --> 0:8:55,887
We just click on every level.


147
0:8:55,887 --> 0:8:58,807
- God, and the sex.
- My name is Vijay.


148
0:8:58,807 --> 0:9:3,367
Let's see who's on their game and start
off with a case of pheochromocytoma.


149
0:9:3,367 --> 0:9:5,647
What is the initial test, Dr Reid?


150
0:9:5,647 --> 0:9:7,647
24-hour urinary metanephrines?


151
0:9:7,647 --> 0:9:10,687
Right-o. And what is your
preoperative treatment?


152
0:9:10,687 --> 0:9:12,487
- ACE inhibitors?
- Wrong-o.


153
0:9:12,487 --> 0:9:16,167
Why don't you attempt to crawl out
of your shame hole,


154
0:9:16,167 --> 0:9:22,887
and tell me the aetiology
of hypocalcaemia in sarcoidosis.


155
0:9:22,887 --> 0:9:24,567
Gutter ball!


156
0:9:24,567 --> 0:9:28,127
Yesterday you were
running around my hospital half-naked.


157
0:9:28,127 --> 0:9:31,167
- Yeah, baby.
- Today you're mucking up my rounds.


158
0:9:31,167 --> 0:9:32,967
ls your ponytail too tight?


159
0:9:32,967 --> 0:9:35,767
Perhaps you have a case
of the boogie-woogie flu?


160
0:9:35,767 --> 0:9:41,247
Something is different,
because you are slipping.


161
0:9:41,247 --> 0:9:45,727
Next patient.


162
0:9:45,727 --> 0:9:50,887
The key to my exercise programme is
this one simple truth: l hate my body.


163
0:9:50,887 --> 0:9:52,367
What?


164
0:9:52,367 --> 0:9:54,927
The second you look in the mirror


165
0:9:54,927 --> 0:9:58,407
and you're happy with what you see,
you just lost the battle.


166
0:9:58,407 --> 0:10:1,447
You should give speeches
to teenage girls.


167
0:10:1,447 --> 0:10:5,167
- l've been looking all over for you.
- Did you bring his leash?


168
0:10:5,167 --> 0:10:8,87
- What are you doing?
- Going for a run with Dr Cox.


169
0:10:8,87 --> 0:10:11,87
But we were supposed to go to the park.


170
0:10:11,87 --> 0:10:13,687
l was gonna let you
tell me how pretty l am.


171
0:10:13,687 --> 0:10:15,967
- See ya, chubby!
- Son of a...


172
0:10:15,967 --> 0:10:20,367
Baby, you're prettier every day.


173
0:10:20,367 --> 0:10:24,47
l'm prettier in the park.


174
0:10:24,47 --> 0:10:27,447
<i>I don't know what it is</i>
<i>but I'm noticing something,</i>


175
0:10:27,447 --> 0:10:46,327
<i>In this hospital</i>
<i>there are sick people everywhere,</i>


176
0:10:46,327 --> 0:11:2,967
l'm OK.


177
0:11:2,967 --> 0:11:7,727
You're a jumpy little fellow. Your blood
tests are negative, so you're fine.


178
0:11:7,727 --> 0:11:12,7
l think l speak for the entire
administration when l say ''whoop-de-do''.


179
0:11:12,7 --> 0:11:13,807
Wrap it up for me, Ned.


180
0:11:13,807 --> 0:11:17,7
- lt's Ted.
- l know.


181
0:11:17,7 --> 0:11:27,647
l know a guy who can
take care of him for us.


182
0:11:27,647 --> 0:11:32,807
One phone call.


183
0:11:32,807 --> 0:11:36,607
<i>I knew I didn't have hepatitis,</i>
<i>Why did I make myself crazy?</i>


184
0:11:36,607 --> 0:11:40,927
<i>John Dorian is stronger than that,</i>


185
0:11:40,927 --> 0:11:44,487
<i>I said John Dorian</i>
<i>is stronger than that,</i>


186
0:11:44,487 --> 0:11:49,87
Carla, could you do me a favour and
just give him a follow-up neuro exam?


187
0:11:49,87 --> 0:11:51,447
l'm just so swamped right now.


188
0:11:51,447 --> 0:11:54,527
- Sure, Bambi. No problem.
- Thank you.


189
0:11:54,527 --> 0:12:2,7
<i>John Dorian's a wuss,</i>


190
0:12:2,7 --> 0:12:5,207
<i>It wasn't that hard for me</i>
<i>to avoid my contagious guy,</i>


191
0:12:5,207 --> 0:12:8,607
Carla, can you check Kernig
and Brudzinski signs on Mr Winston?


192
0:12:8,607 --> 0:12:12,687
- And why can't you do it?
- l would, but l don't got no mojo.


193
0:12:12,687 --> 0:12:15,167
l have to go lecture
some med students


194
0:12:15,167 --> 0:12:17,287
on myocardial infarction.


195
0:12:17,287 --> 0:12:22,527
l saw them waiting for you
in the You're Full of Crap Ward.


196
0:12:22,527 --> 0:12:27,287
You know the way.


197
0:12:27,287 --> 0:12:29,487
What are you doing here?


198
0:12:29,487 --> 0:12:32,847
l bought extra scrubs
so you never have to work topless again.


199
0:12:32,847 --> 0:12:36,287
Unless you start dancing,
which l'm OK with.


200
0:12:36,287 --> 0:12:39,327
- Great. So he's thoughtful too.
- Are you mad at me?


201
0:12:39,327 --> 0:12:41,967
The yelling makes it
seem like you're mad.


202
0:12:41,967 --> 0:12:43,287
You would know.


203
0:12:43,287 --> 0:12:47,7
You're so thoughtful and handsome,
you wouldn't forget your scrubs.


204
0:12:47,7 --> 0:12:52,287
l don't wear scrubs. One time, l locked
my keys in my car while it was running.


205
0:12:52,287 --> 0:12:56,287
- On a bridge.
- l have to go.


206
0:12:56,287 --> 0:13:0,727
l'll call you later, and you can
explain what just happened.


207
0:13:0,727 --> 0:13:3,207
Don't be embarrassed
about staring at my ass.


208
0:13:3,207 --> 0:13:8,327
You're only human,
and everybody does it anyway.


209
0:13:8,327 --> 0:13:11,687
Lonely?


210
0:13:11,687 --> 0:13:13,607
A little.


211
0:13:13,607 --> 0:13:17,687
- l'm doing this for someone else.
- What do you say we pick it up?


212
0:13:17,687 --> 0:13:20,87
Let's pick it up.


213
0:13:20,87 --> 0:13:22,287
<i>When someone calls you out</i>


214
0:13:22,287 --> 0:13:25,127
<i>there's only one thing to do:</i>
<i>Deal with your fear,</i>


215
0:13:25,127 --> 0:13:28,207
Dr Cox, could l get you
to cover Mr Winston?


216
0:13:28,207 --> 0:13:31,927
He's my meningitis patient.
A personality difference.


217
0:13:31,927 --> 0:13:35,767
He says tomato, and l say...


218
0:13:35,767 --> 0:13:37,167
...''to-mah-to.''


219
0:13:37,167 --> 0:13:40,687
Sure. l'll take him.
You grab my three gomers in 408.


220
0:13:40,687 --> 0:13:44,87
- What's wrong with them?
- l assume they're sick.


221
0:13:44,87 --> 0:13:47,287
l thought about what you said before,
and you're right.


222
0:13:47,287 --> 0:13:49,47
l haven't been that nice.


223
0:13:49,47 --> 0:13:51,207
- And?
- That's it.


224
0:13:51,207 --> 0:13:59,807
What, do you want to go to a ballgame
and share a big tub of popcorn?


225
0:13:59,807 --> 0:14:1,887
That's the last time l reach out.


226
0:14:1,887 --> 0:14:6,167
Anybody want to go to a...
Not you.


227
0:14:6,167 --> 0:14:8,847
- Doctors.
- Doctor.


228
0:14:8,847 --> 0:14:10,287
l love that.


229
0:14:10,287 --> 0:14:13,967
Dr Douglas, l got the results back
from your fasting lipids.


230
0:14:13,967 --> 0:14:18,687
Your LLD's very elevated,
so you may want to start a...


231
0:14:18,687 --> 0:14:21,647
HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor?


232
0:14:21,647 --> 0:14:23,407
- You knew the answer.
- Shut up.


233
0:14:23,407 --> 0:14:27,87
- What's your problem?
- This doesn't come easy for me.


234
0:14:27,87 --> 0:14:31,247
l study every night, and you know what
else l do to remember all this crap?


235
0:14:31,247 --> 0:14:35,567
l tape record myself saying it,
and l listen to myself over and over.


236
0:14:35,567 --> 0:14:42,87
Do you have any idea how annoying it is
to hear myself go on and on and on


237
0:14:42,87 --> 0:14:44,87
and on?


238
0:14:44,87 --> 0:14:45,527
No.


239
0:14:45,527 --> 0:14:50,207
Come on. l have problems too.
l traded my meningitis patient.


240
0:14:50,207 --> 0:14:52,767
Traded him like a baseball card.


241
0:14:52,767 --> 0:14:55,167
Wanna know why?
l was afraid of him.


242
0:14:55,167 --> 0:14:59,527
l'm a doctor who's afraid of sick
people. Wanna take a picture with me?


243
0:14:59,527 --> 0:15:2,967
<i>It's a weird feeling when</i>
<i>you realise you've lost the respect</i>


244
0:15:2,967 --> 0:15:7,287
<i>of four people all at once,</i>


245
0:15:7,287 --> 0:15:15,167
<i>But it's nothing compared to</i>
<i>losing respect for yourself,</i>


246
0:15:15,167 --> 0:15:17,47
Push it out. Two more.


247
0:15:17,47 --> 0:15:19,247
Come on, kid. Bitchin' reps.


248
0:15:19,247 --> 0:15:22,247
- A dumb-ass says what?
- What?


249
0:15:22,247 --> 0:15:26,887
l said,
''A dumb-ass says what?''


250
0:15:26,887 --> 0:15:28,327
What?


251
0:15:28,327 --> 0:15:31,167
- You're down here again?
- 20!


252
0:15:31,167 --> 0:15:33,47
Hey, baby.


253
0:15:33,47 --> 0:15:37,207
- You likes?
- l miss you.


254
0:15:37,207 --> 0:15:42,127
Maybe tonight we can, you know,
rent a movie and then not watch it.


255
0:15:42,127 --> 0:15:47,47
We just got started down here.


256
0:15:47,47 --> 0:15:49,7
No problem.


257
0:15:49,7 --> 0:15:53,767
Just don't wake me up if you
get home too late, OK?


258
0:15:53,767 --> 0:15:58,847
Props for the commitment.


259
0:15:58,847 --> 0:16:2,287
- l'm out.
- And there it is.


260
0:16:2,287 --> 0:16:4,567
l knew your ass would quit.


261
0:16:4,567 --> 0:16:7,207
- l got a life.
- Cry me a river.


262
0:16:7,207 --> 0:16:9,327
My dance card is full-up too.


263
0:16:9,327 --> 0:16:11,687
How many nights a week
are you in here?


264
0:16:11,687 --> 0:16:13,847
- A few.
- He's being modest.


265
0:16:13,847 --> 0:16:16,487
He's down here
polishing his guns every night.


266
0:16:16,487 --> 0:16:18,727
That doesn't mean l don't have a life.


267
0:16:18,727 --> 0:16:21,767
A couple times we went
out for a beer after.


268
0:16:21,767 --> 0:16:24,727
- You two have fun.
- Dr Cox.


269
0:16:24,727 --> 0:16:28,767
- Can l get a spot?
- l'm here for you.


270
0:16:28,767 --> 0:16:30,207
Oh, God.


271
0:16:30,207 --> 0:16:32,247
l gotta meet someone.


272
0:16:32,247 --> 0:16:40,527
Big kahuna, little help?


273
0:16:40,527 --> 0:16:44,7
l just came by to apologise.


274
0:16:44,7 --> 0:16:46,887
- For what?
- l'm not sure.


275
0:16:46,887 --> 0:16:48,927
But l am really sorry.


276
0:16:48,927 --> 0:16:52,247
l should be the one apologising.
l got so buried in work,


277
0:16:52,247 --> 0:16:54,927
and then l just took it all out on you.


278
0:16:54,927 --> 0:17:3,367
l'm big on forgiving people who look
like they're about to kiss me.


279
0:17:3,367 --> 0:17:5,607
And the work never ends.


280
0:17:5,607 --> 0:17:8,687
l have to be ready for rounds,
take care of my patients,


281
0:17:8,687 --> 0:17:11,207
l have scut work
and research papers due.


282
0:17:11,207 --> 0:17:14,287
And if my internship
does not go well this year,


283
0:17:14,287 --> 0:17:17,207
l'm not getting
a good residency next year.


284
0:17:17,207 --> 0:17:20,327
And without the residency,
there goes my fellowship,


285
0:17:20,327 --> 0:17:23,87
and that doesn't leave
a lot of time for us.


286
0:17:23,87 --> 0:17:27,247
So l think that maybe
we should make this more casual.


287
0:17:27,247 --> 0:17:30,807
But, come on,
l know l could never be casual with you.


288
0:17:30,807 --> 0:17:35,247
We'd just end up here again, right?


289
0:17:35,247 --> 0:17:37,487
What are you saying?


290
0:17:37,487 --> 0:17:39,647
l don't know.


291
0:17:39,647 --> 0:17:42,887
Then why are you saying it?


292
0:17:42,887 --> 0:17:44,367
My God.


293
0:17:44,367 --> 0:17:48,127
l think l'm saying that l can't
make this work right now.


294
0:17:48,127 --> 0:17:52,967
l've got an idea. Let's go back to where
you said that you should be apologising.


295
0:17:52,967 --> 0:17:55,607
Then we'll kiss again,
cos that was good.


296
0:17:55,607 --> 0:17:59,967
Sean, you don't understand how hard
it was for me just to get to this point.


297
0:17:59,967 --> 0:18:3,487
lf l don't do my best,
l'm going to hate myself for ever.


298
0:18:3,487 --> 0:18:5,687
What's with being the best?


299
0:18:5,687 --> 0:18:8,767
What is so bad about being adequate?
That's what l do.


300
0:18:8,767 --> 0:18:13,527
No, you don't.


301
0:18:13,527 --> 0:18:17,47
l know.


302
0:18:17,47 --> 0:18:25,7
l have to go back in.


303
0:18:25,7 --> 0:18:28,327
l'm just gonna stand here
and wait with these flowers


304
0:18:28,327 --> 0:18:33,967
cos in two minutes you'll realise
what a big mistake you're making.


305
0:18:33,967 --> 0:18:44,47
l hope so.


306
0:18:44,47 --> 0:18:47,327
- l want my meningitis patient back.
- No.


307
0:18:47,327 --> 0:18:51,127
Do you know any women who hate
themselves enough to date me?


308
0:18:51,127 --> 0:18:54,167
- Why'd you let me switch patients?
- You asked me to.


309
0:18:54,167 --> 0:18:58,87
- And because of your puppy-dog eyes.
- You knew l was scared.


310
0:18:58,87 --> 0:19:0,167
Why didn't you tell me to deal with it?


311
0:19:0,167 --> 0:19:2,407
l don't know what it was about that day.


312
0:19:2,407 --> 0:19:6,47
Maybe l hadn't had enough sleep,
maybe my mind was on other things.


313
0:19:6,47 --> 0:19:11,487
Maybe l didn't have enough fibre,
and failed to do my morning business.


314
0:19:11,487 --> 0:19:14,207
l don't know what it was,
but the bottom line is


315
0:19:14,207 --> 0:19:16,567
l didn't feel like
spelling it out for you.


316
0:19:16,567 --> 0:19:20,247
You want your little speech,
and that's fine, because here it is.


317
0:19:20,247 --> 0:19:22,807
You're a doctor. You might get sick.


318
0:19:22,807 --> 0:19:24,287
Get over it.


319
0:19:24,287 --> 0:19:26,687
Thank you.
Now, can l have my patient back?


320
0:19:26,687 --> 0:19:32,367
No. Because, aside from
his weird Judy Blume obsession,


321
0:19:32,367 --> 0:19:36,87
l like him.
You will be delousing Mr Schaffer.


322
0:19:36,87 --> 0:19:38,247
Guy's like flypaper.


323
0:19:38,247 --> 0:19:39,687
Fantastic.


324
0:19:39,687 --> 0:19:41,367
And, Belinda,


325
0:19:41,367 --> 0:19:43,687
do you know what else
is real contagious?


326
0:19:43,687 --> 0:19:48,567
A big ol' smile!

0:19:56,167 --> 0:20:1,727
<i>That means different things</i>

330
