to the Canadian border.

a week into the trip.


5
0:0:21,3 --> 0:0:22,37

6
0:0:22,37 --> 0:0:25,79
I got a lot of unresolved
issues with Harry.

We're in Eugene, Oregon.


10
0:0:33,49 --> 0:0:34,96
And we walked into
a restaurant.


11
0:0:34,96 --> 0:0:36,45
And I'm not pointing fingers
or anything.


12
0:0:36,45 --> 0:0:38,2
But it was, like,
a crab house.


13
0:0:38,2 --> 0:0:40,0
And we really wanted crab.

So he doesn't eat, you
know, whatever.


17
0:0:46,5 --> 0:0:50,4
And the whole restaurant
had maybe three


18
0:0:50,4 --> 0:0:51,21

19
0:0:51,21 --> 0:0:55,88
And they said, sorry,
no seats available.


20
0:0:55,88 --> 0:0:57,17
So I'm not saying
they're racist.


21
0:0:57,17 --> 0:0:58,75

0:0:58,75 --> 0:1:0,68

someone when there's a whole

0:1:0,68 --> 0:1:1,36

24
0:1:1,36 --> 0:1:4,5
We got a really bad
vibe, so we left.

People don't realize this.


26
0:1:5,69 --> 0:1:7,23
But you know, sometimes
when you go north,


27
0:1:7,23 --> 0:1:8,48
shit gets pretty crazy.


28
0:1:8,48 --> 0:1:11,42
People always equate shit
with the south,


29
0:1:11,42 --> 0:1:13,15
like Texas and shit.

The only thing you're passionate
about is hockey.

That's it.

I'm extremely upset right now.

in the way of Alaska.

to walk across the border in

0:10:54,5 --> 0:10:56,15

230
0:10:56,15 --> 0:10:59,55

0:10:59,55 --> 0:11:0,24
What the fuck?


232
0:11:0,24 --> 0:11:3,56
I mean, it was easier getting
out of Mexico.


233
0:11:3,56 --> 0:11:6,401
And Mexico was almost
impossible.

0:11:6,401 --> 0:11:10,87

our tapes.

You'll never get to see the

amazing Alaskan adventure, I'd

find crazy shit in Alaska.

Fuck Canada.

It's Monday.

What a rough night.


261
0:12:17,242 --> 0:12:20,51



262
0:12:20,51 --> 0:12:24,65
I think at this time, I'd like
to issue a formal apology to


263
0:12:24,65 --> 0:12:27,9
the wonderful people
of Canada.


264
0:12:27,9 --> 0:12:30,27
Yesterday I was turned away
from the Canadian border


265
0:12:30,27 --> 0:12:34,64
because of something
I did as a youth.


266
0:12:34,64 --> 0:12:37,32
And I got angry.


267
0:12:37,32 --> 0:12:39,67
And I'm a grown man.


268
0:12:39,67 --> 0:12:42,28
I should take full
responsibility for my actions.


269
0:12:42,28 --> 0:12:43,89
Canada has a long memory,
longer than


270

No judgment, no bitterness,
no sarcasm.

I was turned away which really
set me off, really upset me.


274
0:12:58,15 --> 0:13:0,65

last night that I


275
0:13:0,65 --> 0:13:0,903
shouldn't have said.

I'm not really that
kind of person.


284
0:13:15,555 --> 0:13:16,83
I'm moody sometimes.


285
0:13:16,83 --> 0:13:19,68
But I take pills for
that kind of stuff.

And it puts a major roadblock
in our trip.

DAVID: But then she
still likes girls?


410
0:18:27,26 --> 0:18:27,696
GRANT: Yeah.


411
0:18:27,696 --> 0:18:29,4
DAVID: And you're
OK with that?


412
0:18:29,4 --> 0:18:29,44
GRANT: Yeah.


413
0:18:29,44 --> 0:18:30,756
DAVID: You're a disgusting
human being.


414
0:18:30,756 --> 0:18:31,45
GRANT: [LAUGHS].


415
0:18:31,45 --> 0:18:32,0
Probably.


416
0:18:32,0 --> 0:18:34,8
DAVID: Wait, so did you know
that when you started your


417
0:18:34,8 --> 0:18:36,5
relationship with her?


418
0:18:36,5 --> 0:18:39,24
So you've had, like, tons
of threesomes and stuff?


419
0:18:39,24 --> 0:18:39,685
GRANT: No.


420
0:18:39,685 --> 0:18:41,142
DAVID: She never brings
home girls?


421
0:18:41,142 --> 0:18:42,498
GRANT: No.


422
0:18:42,498 --> 0:18:44,296
DAVID: Do you guys look
at porn together?


423
0:18:44,296 --> 0:18:45,25
GRANT: No.


424
0:18:45,25 --> 0:18:46,6
She looks at it with
her dog, though.


425
0:18:46,6 --> 0:18:47,55
DAVID: How old are you?


426
0:18:47,55 --> 0:18:48,55
GRANT: 20.


427
0:18:48,55 --> 0:18:49,47
DAVID: And how old is she?


428
0:18:49,47 --> 0:18:50,256
GRANT: 19.


429
0:18:50,256 --> 0:18:52,462
DAVID: Is she hot?


430
0:18:52,462 --> 0:18:54,426
GRANT: I'm dating her.


431
0:18:54,426 --> 0:18:55,9
DAVID: All right.


432
0:18:55,9 --> 0:19:0,9
Anything else you want to tell
us about working as a cook at


433
0:19:0,9 --> 0:19:2,16
a pilot's restaurant?


434
0:19:2,16 --> 0:19:3,68
GRANT: There's lots of gay
people that come in here.


435
0:19:3,68 --> 0:19:5,15
I don't know if they're
pilots, though.


436
0:19:5,15 --> 0:19:7,696
DAVID: Do you think that's
a gay pilot right there?


437
0:19:7,696 --> 0:19:8,588
GRANT: I don't know.


438
0:19:8,588 --> 0:19:9,93
I've never seen him before.


439
0:19:9,93 --> 0:19:12,39
DAVID: And what do you
know about Alaska?


440
0:19:12,39 --> 0:19:13,51
GRANT: Not much.


441
0:19:13,51 --> 0:19:15,17
DAVID: Anything.


442
0:19:15,17 --> 0:19:17,3
GRANT: That the capital's
Juneau.


443
0:19:17,3 --> 0:19:18,614
[LAUGHTER]


444
0:19:18,614 --> 0:19:19,928
DAVID: All right.


445
0:19:19,928 --> 0:19:21,286
Thanks for talking to us.


446
0:19:21,286 --> 0:19:22,16
GRANT: Yeah.


447
0:19:22,16 --> 0:19:27,58
DAVID: So what we're finding out
Taildraggers is from what


448
0:19:27,58 --> 0:19:31,54
everyone tells us, it's a
restaurant for pilots.


449
0:19:31,54 --> 0:19:33,73
But it's also, like,
Taildraggers.


450
0:19:33,73 --> 0:19:38,51
I guess it's an analogy for
gay sex, or something.


451
0:19:38,51 --> 0:19:42,605
So it's like a gay pilot's
restaurant or something.


452
0:19:42,605 --> 0:19:51,64



453
0:19:51,64 --> 0:19:52,125
I don't know.


454
0:19:52,125 --> 0:19:53,19
He's pretty flaming.


455
0:19:53,19 --> 0:19:54,93
He started petting
Harry's hat.


456
0:19:54,93 --> 0:19:58,55
We got the most flaming pilot to
give us a ride into Alaska.


457
0:19:58,55 --> 0:20:1,4
Fucking skip all of Canada.


458
0:20:1,4 --> 0:20:2,41
Fuck you, Canada--


459
0:20:2,41 --> 0:20:3,57
thumbs down.


460
0:20:3,57 --> 0:20:4,48
Thumbs up, America.


461
0:20:4,48 --> 0:20:5,35
We love you, Alaska.


462
0:20:5,35 --> 0:20:6,6
We'll see you soon.


463
0:20:6,6 --> 0:20:40,27



464
0:20:40,27 --> 0:20:40,87
ANDREW: You guys ready?


465
0:20:40,87 --> 0:20:41,77
DAVID: Yeah.


466
0:20:41,77 --> 0:20:43,57
You thought you were going
to stop me, huh, Canada?


467
0:20:43,57 --> 0:20:45,97
You thought you were going
to get in my way.


468
0:20:45,97 --> 0:20:47,22
But we're going to skip
you altogether.


469
0:20:47,22 --> 0:22:47,22
