1
0:0:2,14 --> 0:0:3,558
Prof: Okay.
 


2
0:0:3,558 --> 0:0:7,89
Today we are going to be
discussing certainly one of the


3
0:0:7,89 --> 0:0:11,83
biggest bestsellers in early
American history,


4
0:0:11,83 --> 0:0:14,92
and that's Thomas Paine's
pamphlet Common Sense.


5
0:0:14,92 --> 0:0:17,8
Before I plunge in to Common
Sense,


6
0:0:17,8 --> 0:0:21,272
I am going to answer the
question that was asked from


7
0:0:21,272 --> 0:0:23,69
this section of the room on
Tuesday,


8
0:0:23,69 --> 0:0:26,88
about how do you vote on
voting--the little brain teaser


9
0:0:26,88 --> 0:0:28,62
of the Continental Congress.
 


10
0:0:28,62 --> 0:0:29,99
And I found the answer to this
question.


11
0:0:29,99 --> 0:0:30,236
Okay.
 


12
0:0:30,236 --> 0:0:33,149
So the answer to the question
is: they actually had a pretty


13
0:0:33,149 --> 0:0:35,567
animated debate in the
Continental Congress on the


14
0:0:35,567 --> 0:0:38,634
whole voting question,
and some people said it should


15
0:0:38,634 --> 0:0:41,5
be according to population and
some said,


16
0:0:41,5 --> 0:0:44,27
'Well, you should put property
in with population,' and some


17
0:0:44,27 --> 0:0:46,72
people said one colony,
one vote.


18
0:0:46,72 --> 0:0:49,9
And with--after apparently
arguing for quite some time,


19
0:0:49,9 --> 0:0:52,75
what they realized was they
actually really didn't have an


20
0:0:52,75 --> 0:0:56,54
orderly way to figure out
population and property worth,


21
0:0:56,54 --> 0:0:58,38
[laughter]
and so they ultimately just


22
0:0:58,38 --> 0:1:0,392
decided one colony,
one vote, [laughs]


23
0:1:0,392 --> 0:1:2,829
--like, that's all we can do.
 


24
0:1:2,829 --> 0:1:4,799
And they were really concerned
because they didn't want that to


25
0:1:4,799 --> 0:1:5,34
be a precedent.
 


26
0:1:5,34 --> 0:1:7,634
They were all worried that
they'd be setting a precedent


27
0:1:7,634 --> 0:1:8,26
for all time.
 


28
0:1:8,26 --> 0:1:10,29
So when they wrote it down in
the minutes,


29
0:1:10,29 --> 0:1:12,11
they said, we're deciding one
colony,


30
0:1:12,11 --> 0:1:14,572
one vote, but not with the idea
that it will be a precedent for


31
0:1:14,572 --> 0:1:15,1
all time.
 


32
0:1:15,1 --> 0:1:17,614
Of course, it then becomes a
precedent for Congress under the


33
0:1:17,614 --> 0:1:18,83
Articles of Confederation.
 


34
0:1:18,83 --> 0:1:20,938
But the answer to the
question--how did they vote?--


35
0:1:20,938 --> 0:1:23,54
is apparently someone made a
motion--


36
0:1:23,54 --> 0:1:26,86
'I make a motion that we just
do the one colony,


37
0:1:26,86 --> 0:1:30,605
one vote thing'--and people
just voted on the motion as a


38
0:1:30,605 --> 0:1:31,14
group.
 


39
0:1:31,14 --> 0:1:33,509
So that is the answer to the
question: How do you vote on


40
0:1:33,509 --> 0:1:33,89
voting?
 


41
0:1:33,89 --> 0:1:36,649
I had not thought about it
before and yet historians have


42
0:1:36,649 --> 0:1:38,62
addressed it so there you go
so--Okay.


43
0:1:38,62 --> 0:1:40,5
That is the answer to the
question.


44
0:1:40,5 --> 0:1:43,358
On to Common Sense,
which really,


45
0:1:43,358 --> 0:1:46,29
truly unquestionably was a
bestseller.


46
0:1:46,29 --> 0:1:52,339
It actually sold over 120,000
copies in its first few months


47
0:1:52,339 --> 0:1:54,791
in print,
and a little bit later in the


48
0:1:54,791 --> 0:1:57,4
lecture I'm going to give you a
sense of how that compares with


49
0:1:57,4 --> 0:1:59,97
how some other things might have
sold in this time period.


50
0:1:59,97 --> 0:2:3,575
You'll really get a sense of
what kind of a bestseller this


51
0:2:3,575 --> 0:2:3,95
was.
 


52
0:2:3,95 --> 0:2:6,991
And certainly many scholars
consider it to be the most


53
0:2:6,991 --> 0:2:9,86
brilliant political pamphlet of
the Revolution,


54
0:2:9,86 --> 0:2:12,357
not necessarily for the
subtlety of its argument but


55
0:2:12,357 --> 0:2:14,61
certainly for the way in which
it's argued,


56
0:2:14,61 --> 0:2:17,59
and I'll talk more about that
in the course of the lecture.


57
0:2:17,59 --> 0:2:20,58
So what we're going to be
looking at is the pamphlet


58
0:2:20,58 --> 0:2:23,688
itself and what specifically
made it so remarkable.


59
0:2:23,688 --> 0:2:27,14
And then we're also going to
look some at its author,


60
0:2:27,14 --> 0:2:29,699
Thomas Paine,
who he was and how he came to


61
0:2:29,699 --> 0:2:32,128
produce this influential
pamphlet.


62
0:2:32,128 --> 0:2:35,878
But I actually want to begin
with something that I just--


63
0:2:35,878 --> 0:2:39,128
in my head when I think about
Thomas Paine I think about this,


64
0:2:39,128 --> 0:2:41,25
so I feel like I can't start
this lecture without discussing


65
0:2:41,25 --> 0:2:41,43
it.
 


66
0:2:41,43 --> 0:2:44,663
And that has to do with the
death of Thomas Paine or


67
0:2:44,663 --> 0:2:48,34
actually, to be more accurate,
the body of Thomas Paine.


68
0:2:48,34 --> 0:2:48,657
Okay.
 


69
0:2:48,657 --> 0:2:52,61
It's one of the sad ironies of
history that this person who--


70
0:2:52,61 --> 0:2:55,13
all through this lecture I'm
going to be talking about the


71
0:2:55,13 --> 0:2:57,241
great influence of his pamphlet,
had this great influence


72
0:2:57,241 --> 0:2:59,76
throughout the Revolution--
and he actually died pretty


73
0:2:59,76 --> 0:3:2,921
much poor and not very much
liked by Americans of all


74
0:3:2,921 --> 0:3:5,522
political stripes,
more having to do with his


75
0:3:5,522 --> 0:3:8,389
politics later in his life than
what he was doing during the


76
0:3:8,389 --> 0:3:11,169
Revolution,
but he was not a happy camper


77
0:3:11,169 --> 0:3:13,8
in the years of his death.
 


78
0:3:13,8 --> 0:3:16,44
But the most horrifying thing
about Paine's death has to do


79
0:3:16,44 --> 0:3:17,68
with the question of his body.
 


80
0:3:17,68 --> 0:3:18,58
Okay.
 


81
0:3:18,58 --> 0:3:21,853
So Paine first asked about
being buried in a Quaker


82
0:3:21,853 --> 0:3:24,358
cemetery,
and the Quakers weren't very


83
0:3:24,358 --> 0:3:27,664
excited about that because they
were not really hoping to have


84
0:3:27,664 --> 0:3:31,188
that cemetery become a tourist
attraction so that didn't work.


85
0:3:31,188 --> 0:3:35,4
So he basically ended up at
first being buried on his small


86
0:3:35,4 --> 0:3:37,36
farm in upstate New York.
 


87
0:3:37,36 --> 0:3:41,287
A few years later a newspaper
editor named William Cobbett


88
0:3:41,287 --> 0:3:45,491
decided that what he was going
to do was disinter the body and


89
0:3:45,491 --> 0:3:49,413
take it back to England,
and then in England they would


90
0:3:49,413 --> 0:3:51,66
set up a memorial to Thomas
Paine.


91
0:3:51,66 --> 0:3:52,979
This was his plan.
 


92
0:3:52,979 --> 0:3:54,6
So he did.
 


93
0:3:54,6 --> 0:3:55,979
He disinterred the body;
he went on a boat;


94
0:3:55,979 --> 0:3:59,758
he and dead-body Paine went
sailing back to England.


95
0:3:59,758 --> 0:4:2,76
Got back to England,
raised the issue and apparently


96
0:4:2,76 --> 0:4:6,175
did not get very much support
for the idea of a memorial of


97
0:4:6,175 --> 0:4:7,0
some kind.
 


98
0:4:7,0 --> 0:4:10,408
At this point it gets a little
sad.


99
0:4:10,408 --> 0:4:10,675
Okay.
 


100
0:4:10,675 --> 0:4:13,605
So not knowing what else to
do--and why at this point he


101
0:4:13,605 --> 0:4:15,949
didn't think to bury him
someplace else,


102
0:4:15,949 --> 0:4:20,468
I don't know--but apparently he
had the bones put in a trunk and


103
0:4:20,468 --> 0:4:23,5
kept them on his farm for a
while.


104
0:4:23,5 --> 0:4:23,386
Okay.
 


105
0:4:23,386 --> 0:4:26,75
So, body of Paine sitting on
his farm in England.


106
0:4:26,75 --> 0:4:31,447
Then he died--Mr. Cobbett
died and the trunk and Paine was


107
0:4:31,447 --> 0:4:35,96
passed on to his son,
and then his son I guess went


108
0:4:35,96 --> 0:4:37,797
into debt in some way and his
belongings began to get


109
0:4:37,797 --> 0:4:40,913
auctioned off and the person
doing the auctioning didn't want


110
0:4:40,913 --> 0:4:43,769
to have anything to do with
auctioning off a body.


111
0:4:43,769 --> 0:4:46,476
Like, I've never auctioned off
a body before,


112
0:4:46,476 --> 0:4:50,105
I don't want anything to do
with this--and basically Paine's


113
0:4:50,105 --> 0:4:51,519
corpse disappeared.
 


114
0:4:51,519 --> 0:4:54,879
We really do not know where
Thomas Paine is.


115
0:4:54,879 --> 0:4:59,646
Truly, there was a trunk and it
had Paine in it and then it


116
0:4:59,646 --> 0:5:0,55
vanished.
 


117
0:5:0,55 --> 0:5:3,99
And I went searching today
before I gave this lecture,


118
0:5:3,99 --> 0:5:6,925
trying to figure out
like--okay, maybe there's been a


119
0:5:6,925 --> 0:5:9,92
recent development in the search
for Thomas Paine,


120
0:5:9,92 --> 0:5:12,629
the corpse, and no actually.
 


121
0:5:12,629 --> 0:5:15,968
Although I did discover that in
2001 there was a society that


122
0:5:15,968 --> 0:5:19,141
wanted to create some kind of
memorial here in America and


123
0:5:19,141 --> 0:5:22,314
they decided that they were
going to try to trace the body


124
0:5:22,314 --> 0:5:24,93
so they set out trying to trace
the body.


125
0:5:24,93 --> 0:5:27,37
What they found was,
all over the world are people


126
0:5:27,37 --> 0:5:29,411
who claim to have a piece of
Thomas Paine,


127
0:5:29,411 --> 0:5:29,91
right?
 


128
0:5:29,91 --> 0:5:33,17
Well, his skull might be in
Australia but his leg--that


129
0:5:33,17 --> 0:5:34,5
might be in England.
 


130
0:5:34,5 --> 0:5:37,317
So the sort of--the horrifying
end to Thomas Paine is his body


131
0:5:37,317 --> 0:5:39,903
disappeared and perhaps little
pieces of Thomas Paine are


132
0:5:39,903 --> 0:5:42,49
floating around as little relics
all over the world.


133
0:5:42,49 --> 0:5:46,209
So that's Paine's sort of weird
ending,


134
0:5:46,209 --> 0:5:49,416
certainly not the kind of
ending that you would wish for


135
0:5:49,416 --> 0:5:52,68
the person who has written the
pamphlet we're going to be


136
0:5:52,68 --> 0:5:54,79
talking about today.
 


137
0:5:54,79 --> 0:5:57,156
And we are given that--what he
ended up writing was so


138
0:5:57,156 --> 0:6:0,348
influential and so different
from much of what was being


139
0:6:0,348 --> 0:6:1,8
written at this time.
 


140
0:6:1,8 --> 0:6:6,406
Now as I said at the outset,
it's not the great subtleties


141
0:6:6,406 --> 0:6:9,72
of its argument that made it
stand out.


142
0:6:9,72 --> 0:6:13,47
And in fact its popularity was
due to the very things that were


143
0:6:13,47 --> 0:6:16,72
its greatest strengths:
the fact that it was


144
0:6:16,72 --> 0:6:18,918
passionate,
the fact that it had a really


145
0:6:18,918 --> 0:6:21,889
simple style,
that it spoke to the common


146
0:6:21,889 --> 0:6:26,108
man, that it captured and
completely overturned prevailing


147
0:6:26,108 --> 0:6:30,182
colonial ideas about the
relationship between the mother


148
0:6:30,182 --> 0:6:33,69
country and the American
colonies.


149
0:6:33,69 --> 0:6:37,151
As someone wrote at the time,
Paine spoke a language which


150
0:6:37,151 --> 0:6:40,16
the colonists had felt,
but not thought.


151
0:6:40,16 --> 0:6:44,55
One of the remarkable things
about the pamphlet is that it


152
0:6:44,55 --> 0:6:47,884
was written by a somewhat
bankrupt English corset-maker a


153
0:6:47,884 --> 0:6:51,711
mere fourteen months after he
had arrived in America from


154
0:6:51,711 --> 0:6:52,67
England.
 


155
0:6:52,67 --> 0:6:55,41
Basically speaking,
Paine knew relatively little


156
0:6:55,41 --> 0:6:58,5
about colonial affairs when he
decided to write it.


157
0:6:58,5 --> 0:7:1,41
He wasn't really an established
writer.


158
0:7:1,41 --> 0:7:2,709
He had done writing before.
 


159
0:7:2,709 --> 0:7:5,586
I'll talk a little bit about
this today, but he wasn't this


160
0:7:5,586 --> 0:7:7,769
sort of well-known and
established writer.


161
0:7:7,769 --> 0:7:8,79
He wrote some for newspapers.
 


162
0:7:8,79 --> 0:7:13,113
And actually the idea for the
pamphlet initially wasn't really


163
0:7:13,113 --> 0:7:13,54
his.
 


164
0:7:13,54 --> 0:7:16,661
He wrote it at the
encouragement of Dr. Benjamin


165
0:7:16,661 --> 0:7:17,259
Rush.
 


166
0:7:17,259 --> 0:7:19,937
I mentioned that in the first
lecture, and I'm going to come


167
0:7:19,937 --> 0:7:20,8
back to that too.
 


168
0:7:20,8 --> 0:7:23,72
So Paine is relatively new to
the colonies,


169
0:7:23,72 --> 0:7:27,404
not really an established
writer, so how is it that he


170
0:7:27,404 --> 0:7:29,769
ends up writing this pamphlet?
 


171
0:7:29,769 --> 0:7:34,66
Well, more than anything else
it actually was Paine's


172
0:7:34,66 --> 0:7:40,19
experience of events in the
colonies between 1775 and 1776


173
0:7:40,19 --> 0:7:43,29
that inspired what he wrote.
 


174
0:7:43,29 --> 0:7:47,281
Now let's look for a moment
at--to see here what Paine is


175
0:7:47,281 --> 0:7:51,61
experiencing in that year before
he wrote the pamphlet.


176
0:7:51,61 --> 0:7:53,81
What is happening around him.
 


177
0:7:53,81 --> 0:7:56,334
I'm going to talk about this
really briefly here because I'll


178
0:7:56,334 --> 0:7:58,48
be talking in more detail about
this on Tuesday,


179
0:7:58,48 --> 0:8:1,6
but one thing I will mention
here very briefly is,


180
0:8:1,6 --> 0:8:5,24
part of what happens between
1775 and 1776 is the meeting of


181
0:8:5,24 --> 0:8:7,338
the Second Continental Congress.
 


182
0:8:7,338 --> 0:8:11,16
And that actually begins
meeting in the spring of 1775.


183
0:8:11,16 --> 0:8:14,8
I'll talk about the details of
the Congress Tuesday.


184
0:8:14,8 --> 0:8:16,93
For now, I'll just talk about
the general mindset.


185
0:8:16,93 --> 0:8:19,839
For one thing,
no colony instructed its


186
0:8:19,839 --> 0:8:24,127
delegates to this Second
Continental Congress to work for


187
0:8:24,127 --> 0:8:25,43
independence.
 


188
0:8:25,43 --> 0:8:27,519
That was not the agenda.
 


189
0:8:27,519 --> 0:8:30,5
Delegates were pretty much
still acting under the


190
0:8:30,5 --> 0:8:34,41
assumption that they were trying
to force Parliament or the King


191
0:8:34,41 --> 0:8:38,11
or someone to acknowledge their
liberties and redress their


192
0:8:38,11 --> 0:8:41,86
grievances,
and the overall assumption


193
0:8:41,86 --> 0:8:45,601
still was that balance had been
thrown off within the British


194
0:8:45,601 --> 0:8:49,139
constitution and it needed to be
rebalanced.


195
0:8:49,139 --> 0:8:51,634
So they're talking about trying
to figure out a way of balancing


196
0:8:51,634 --> 0:8:53,231
things,
maybe a new balance,


197
0:8:53,231 --> 0:8:56,538
but they're not talking about
throwing the entire system


198
0:8:56,538 --> 0:8:57,8
aside.
 


199
0:8:57,8 --> 0:9:0,605
Actually, in the minds of many
at the time they probably were


200
0:9:0,605 --> 0:9:3,423
thinking,
why destroy what had for a very


201
0:9:3,423 --> 0:9:7,582
long time been one of the most
successful political empires in


202
0:9:7,582 --> 0:9:8,47
the world.
 


203
0:9:8,47 --> 0:9:11,831
John Adams noted in his diary
at the opening of the Second


204
0:9:11,831 --> 0:9:15,309
Continental Congress that at
what he called an "elegant


205
0:9:15,309 --> 0:9:18,2
supper" at the opening of
the Congress,


206
0:9:18,2 --> 0:9:20,678
many representatives and their
friends toasted,


207
0:9:20,678 --> 0:9:23,422
quote, "the Union of
Britain and the Colonies on a


208
0:9:23,422 --> 0:9:25,149
constitutional foundation."
 


209
0:9:25,149 --> 0:9:25,469
Okay.
 


210
0:9:25,469 --> 0:9:29,178
So that's what they're hoping
for as this Congress opens.


211
0:9:29,178 --> 0:9:33,899
As an example of this initial
mindset of the Congress--


212
0:9:33,899 --> 0:9:37,456
again more about this
Tuesday--moderates attempted one


213
0:9:37,456 --> 0:9:41,82
last stab at some kind of basic
reconciliation with the Crown,


214
0:9:41,82 --> 0:9:44,787
and they issued what came to be
known as the Olive Branch


215
0:9:44,787 --> 0:9:45,37
Petition.
 


216
0:9:45,37 --> 0:9:49,69
It failed for a number of
reasons--again more next week--


217
0:9:49,69 --> 0:9:52,712
one of the most basic reasons
being the King refused to read


218
0:9:52,712 --> 0:9:55,827
the Olive Branch Petition,
which pretty much is the way to


219
0:9:55,827 --> 0:9:57,769
guarantee the failure of a
petition.


220
0:9:57,769 --> 0:10:0,418
By doing that,
the King basically gave some


221
0:10:0,418 --> 0:10:3,889
credence to the views of the
more radical members of the


222
0:10:3,889 --> 0:10:7,734
Continental Congress,
and radicals got even more


223
0:10:7,734 --> 0:10:12,76
credence on August 23,
1775, when the King issued a


224
0:10:12,76 --> 0:10:17,1
proclamation that declared the
colonies to be in rebellion,


225
0:10:17,1 --> 0:10:22,812
and then made plans to send
20,000 British troops to the


226
0:10:22,812 --> 0:10:26,35
colonies,
including Prussian mercenaries.


227
0:10:26,35 --> 0:10:29,452
Okay, a big change in things,
much more detail Tuesday,


228
0:10:29,452 --> 0:10:32,611
but this is important to the
setting of Common Sense.


229
0:10:32,611 --> 0:10:34,605
So the King ignores the Olive


230
0:10:34,605 --> 0:10:35,47
Branch Petition.
 


231
0:10:35,47 --> 0:10:38,264
He's sending troops,
not just any troops but


232
0:10:38,264 --> 0:10:41,514
literally hired guns,
right?--foreign hired guns to


233
0:10:41,514 --> 0:10:43,9
go to the colonies.
 


234
0:10:43,9 --> 0:10:46,909
So the colonies have now been
declared in rebellion.


235
0:10:46,909 --> 0:10:47,84
An army is coming.
 


236
0:10:47,84 --> 0:10:51,139
At this point the colonists
realize that they need to maybe


237
0:10:51,139 --> 0:10:54,211
take some form of action and
make some kind of military


238
0:10:54,211 --> 0:10:57,226
preparation,
not in an aggressive way but


239
0:10:57,226 --> 0:10:59,418
certainly in a defensive way.
 


240
0:10:59,418 --> 0:11:3,799
Even as they began to do this
and try to stock up on military


241
0:11:3,799 --> 0:11:6,94
supplies and engage in militia
training,


242
0:11:6,94 --> 0:11:10,458
still a lot of colonists
considered it pretty unlikely


243
0:11:10,458 --> 0:11:12,85
that a string of relatively
weak--


244
0:11:12,85 --> 0:11:16,572
prosperous as they
were--colonies could hope to


245
0:11:16,572 --> 0:11:19,903
defeat England,
the most powerful nation on


246
0:11:19,903 --> 0:11:20,389
earth.
 


247
0:11:20,389 --> 0:11:24,316
And even if they did
miraculously somehow manage to


248
0:11:24,316 --> 0:11:26,6
do that,
certainly also most people in


249
0:11:26,6 --> 0:11:29,0
the colonies would have assumed
that instantly,


250
0:11:29,0 --> 0:11:32,57
foreign powers would have come
zipping over to North America


251
0:11:32,57 --> 0:11:35,269
and would have swallowed up
these helpless little colonies,


252
0:11:35,269 --> 0:11:37,825
and so now instead of belonging
to England they would have


253
0:11:37,825 --> 0:11:39,44
belonged to France or maybe
Spain.


254
0:11:39,44 --> 0:11:42,37
So certainly things weren't
really feeling really optimistic


255
0:11:42,37 --> 0:11:45,104
at this moment in which things
seemed to be dramatically


256
0:11:45,104 --> 0:11:47,585
shifting,
and this is the setting in


257
0:11:47,585 --> 0:11:49,99
which Paine wrote Common
Sense.


258
0:11:49,99 --> 0:11:52,976
In his mind,
the time was right for some


259
0:11:52,976 --> 0:11:57,354
kind of a drastic change for the
better in the American colonies


260
0:11:57,354 --> 0:11:58,888
and,
as we'll see,


261
0:11:58,888 --> 0:12:3,82
instead of just tinkering with
the English constitution Paine


262
0:12:3,82 --> 0:12:7,438
basically turns his back on it,
rejects King George III,


263
0:12:7,438 --> 0:12:11,5
rejects Parliament,
and ultimately rejects even the


264
0:12:11,5 --> 0:12:12,889
idea of monarchy.
 


265
0:12:12,889 --> 0:12:16,798
So instead of centering on the
British constitution,


266
0:12:16,798 --> 0:12:21,254
Paine based his ideas about
colonial society and government


267
0:12:21,254 --> 0:12:25,91
on natural rights logic,
arguing that the colonies


268
0:12:25,91 --> 0:12:28,899
should join in a new government
grounded on equality.


269
0:12:28,899 --> 0:12:32,0
Now obviously ideas about
natural rights,


270
0:12:32,0 --> 0:12:34,558
natural rights talk,
isn't new.


271
0:12:34,558 --> 0:12:39,279
Paine's achievement was to take
those kinds of ideas and in a


272
0:12:39,279 --> 0:12:42,19
sense give them to ordinary
people.


273
0:12:42,19 --> 0:12:45,966
Part of what he argues in his
pamphlet is: this isn't some


274
0:12:45,966 --> 0:12:48,418
great high constitutional
argument.


275
0:12:48,418 --> 0:12:52,298
This is about you and me and
life in the colonies.


276
0:12:52,298 --> 0:12:56,221
And, as we'll see,
in method and in audience and


277
0:12:56,221 --> 0:13:1,227
in argument--for all of these
reasons, Paine's pamphlet had a


278
0:13:1,227 --> 0:13:2,48
big impact.
 


279
0:13:2,48 --> 0:13:6,842
So let's look for a moment at
who this man was who wrote this


280
0:13:6,842 --> 0:13:8,879
early American bestseller.
 


281
0:13:8,879 --> 0:13:11,46
Well, he was relatively poor.
 


282
0:13:11,46 --> 0:13:13,538
He was never really well off.
 


283
0:13:13,538 --> 0:13:15,433
Obviously, he was an
intelligent--strikingly


284
0:13:15,433 --> 0:13:16,36
intelligent person.
 


285
0:13:16,36 --> 0:13:19,639
He was someone who loved to
assert his own importance.


286
0:13:19,639 --> 0:13:21,528
He loved to brag about his
great accomplishments.


287
0:13:21,528 --> 0:13:24,149
He loved to dominate a
conversation.


288
0:13:24,149 --> 0:13:26,702
It's possible towards the end
of his life he may have had a


289
0:13:26,702 --> 0:13:27,538
drinking problem.
 


290
0:13:27,538 --> 0:13:29,99
I tried to get authoritative
word on this.


291
0:13:29,99 --> 0:13:32,7
Probably I didn't realize it.
 


292
0:13:32,7 --> 0:13:34,72
When I'm-- I--Although I've
taught this course before,


293
0:13:34,72 --> 0:13:37,317
before I give every lecture I
actually go over it and kind of


294
0:13:37,317 --> 0:13:39,874
redo it and then I research
things so before I come to class


295
0:13:39,874 --> 0:13:41,519
I'm actually having these
random--


296
0:13:41,519 --> 0:13:43,37
It's like a big game of Trivial
Pursuit.


297
0:13:43,37 --> 0:13:45,799
Was Thomas Paine really drunk?
 


298
0:13:45,799 --> 0:13:47,389
Research, research, research.
 


299
0:13:47,389 --> 0:13:48,23
Okay. Maybe not so much.
 


300
0:13:48,23 --> 0:13:49,45
What happened to the body?
 


301
0:13:49,45 --> 0:13:50,95
Oh. We still don't know.
 


302
0:13:50,95 --> 0:13:51,99
Okay. Okay.
 


303
0:13:51,99 --> 0:13:54,866
So I have these weird Trivial
Pursuit moments in preparation


304
0:13:54,866 --> 0:13:55,94
for the course here.
 


305
0:13:55,94 --> 0:13:57,854
So, maybe drunk,
maybe not, a slight drinking


306
0:13:57,854 --> 0:13:58,289
problem.
 


307
0:13:58,289 --> 0:13:59,788
Historians disagree.
 


308
0:13:59,788 --> 0:14:3,82
Either way, he was born in
England in 1737.


309
0:14:3,82 --> 0:14:8,269
Supposedly the cottage that he
was born in was literally in the


310
0:14:8,269 --> 0:14:12,538
shadow of a place of execution,
so the dark hand of the State


311
0:14:12,538 --> 0:14:15,44
was looming over the cottage of
Thomas Paine.


312
0:14:15,44 --> 0:14:17,45
He was born poor.
 


313
0:14:17,45 --> 0:14:20,158
His father was a stay-maker.
 


314
0:14:20,158 --> 0:14:23,292
Paine did go to grammar school
and he liked learning,


315
0:14:23,292 --> 0:14:26,785
but at the age of 12 he was
pulled out to be apprenticed to


316
0:14:26,785 --> 0:14:27,69
his father.
 


317
0:14:27,69 --> 0:14:30,318
As a young man,
he had a number of different


318
0:14:30,318 --> 0:14:30,87
trades.
 


319
0:14:30,87 --> 0:14:33,11
None of them were enormously
successful.


320
0:14:33,11 --> 0:14:36,58
I think for a little while he
might have been a sailor.


321
0:14:36,58 --> 0:14:37,798
I think he was a minor
officeholder.


322
0:14:37,798 --> 0:14:40,83
I think he was an excise man in
England for a little while.


323
0:14:40,83 --> 0:14:44,783
In his spare time he liked to
go to public lectures in London,


324
0:14:44,783 --> 0:14:48,22
and that's where he met men
like Benjamin Franklin.


325
0:14:48,22 --> 0:14:53,149
And Franklin ultimately proved
important to Paine,


326
0:14:53,149 --> 0:14:56,605
because Paine ended up doing
what a lot of sort of vaguely


327
0:14:56,605 --> 0:14:59,879
rootless people in England might
have decided to do.


328
0:14:59,879 --> 0:15:2,634
He decided to try his luck in
the American colonies where


329
0:15:2,634 --> 0:15:5,49
there seemed to be some
opportunity for self-promotion,


330
0:15:5,49 --> 0:15:7,519
for sort of making something of
yourself.


331
0:15:7,519 --> 0:15:10,427
But before setting off,
Paine did an intelligent thing,


332
0:15:10,427 --> 0:15:12,528
and that is,
he made an appointment with


333
0:15:12,528 --> 0:15:13,23
Franklin.
 


334
0:15:13,23 --> 0:15:15,48
And Franklin did an important
thing.


335
0:15:15,48 --> 0:15:18,87
He wrote a letter of
recommendation for Paine.


336
0:15:18,87 --> 0:15:22,188
And a letter of recommendation
in this period was kind of a


337
0:15:22,188 --> 0:15:24,616
magical thing because,
if you think about it,


338
0:15:24,616 --> 0:15:27,471
unlike now where there are five
million ways in which we all can


339
0:15:27,471 --> 0:15:30,182
check on each other,
there really weren't ways in


340
0:15:30,182 --> 0:15:33,774
which one person knew anything
about a stranger or could verify


341
0:15:33,774 --> 0:15:36,44
or check on who some complete
stranger was.


342
0:15:36,44 --> 0:15:39,173
There's a reason why the early
nineteenth century is the age of


343
0:15:39,173 --> 0:15:39,702
the con man.
 


344
0:15:39,702 --> 0:15:40,1
Right?
 


345
0:15:40,1 --> 0:15:41,879
It's really easy for someone to
drift into town,


346
0:15:41,879 --> 0:15:44,1
claim to be somebody,
no one has a way of checking,


347
0:15:44,1 --> 0:15:47,192
and then the person can drift
out, taking various amounts of


348
0:15:47,192 --> 0:15:48,87
money and belongings with him.
 


349
0:15:48,87 --> 0:15:52,2
So letters of recommendation
were kind of magical because


350
0:15:52,2 --> 0:15:55,509
basically they represented one
person vouching their reputation


351
0:15:55,509 --> 0:15:56,408
for another.
 


352
0:15:56,408 --> 0:15:59,613
The person who wrote it said,
'I'm writing this letter for


353
0:15:59,613 --> 0:16:0,399
Mr. Paine.
 


354
0:16:0,399 --> 0:16:2,732
I, Mr. Franklin,
am writing for Mr. Paine and


355
0:16:2,732 --> 0:16:5,86
I'm introducing him to your
attention and wish that you will


356
0:16:5,86 --> 0:16:9,519
introduce yourself to him and
show him around Philadelphia'--


357
0:16:9,519 --> 0:16:11,923
seemingly a basic statement,
but Franklin was basically


358
0:16:11,923 --> 0:16:13,678
saying,
'I'm--Here's my reputation.


359
0:16:13,678 --> 0:16:16,797
I'm vouching for this guy so
you could--you can get to know


360
0:16:16,797 --> 0:16:17,12
him.
 


361
0:16:17,12 --> 0:16:18,96
You can trust him because I'm
recommending him.'


362
0:16:18,96 --> 0:16:21,778
So it was a smart move on
Paine's part.


363
0:16:21,778 --> 0:16:24,65
It was a nice thing for
Franklin to do,


364
0:16:24,65 --> 0:16:27,732
and in the letter that Franklin
wrote he referred Paine to his


365
0:16:27,732 --> 0:16:30,558
son-in-law, Richard Bache,
in Philadelphia.


366
0:16:30,558 --> 0:16:35,798
So Paine arrived in America in
late 1774,


367
0:16:35,798 --> 0:16:38,926
but apparently the whole
overseas passage was pretty


368
0:16:38,926 --> 0:16:42,666
horrible so he was pretty much
out of commission until January


369
0:16:42,666 --> 0:16:44,532
1775,
and at that point when he was


370
0:16:44,532 --> 0:16:46,918
up and about,
Bache offered to introduce him


371
0:16:46,918 --> 0:16:49,529
into the local literary and
political scene.


372
0:16:49,529 --> 0:16:52,7
Now what happened next is a
really good case for the


373
0:16:52,7 --> 0:16:55,11
importance of serendipity and
the importance of bookstores.


374
0:16:55,11 --> 0:16:55,524
Okay.
 


375
0:16:55,524 --> 0:17:0,168
So Paine liked to hang out in
this one local bookstore.


376
0:17:0,168 --> 0:17:2,37
Apparently he went there every
day.


377
0:17:2,37 --> 0:17:2,625
Okay.
 


378
0:17:2,625 --> 0:17:4,676
That's the local literary
scene--[laughs]


379
0:17:4,676 --> 0:17:7,319
the bookstore--
and he befriended the owner of


380
0:17:7,319 --> 0:17:10,587
the bookstore and the owner
eventually invited Paine to be


381
0:17:10,587 --> 0:17:13,798
the editor of a new journal that
he wanted to start,


382
0:17:13,798 --> 0:17:15,95
that he was calling the
Pennsylvania Magazine.


383
0:17:15,95 --> 0:17:18,367
So Paine wrote for the
Pennsylvania Magazine for


384
0:17:18,367 --> 0:17:20,876
a while and he wrote a
bunch of different kinds of


385
0:17:20,876 --> 0:17:21,369
things.
 


386
0:17:21,369 --> 0:17:22,47
He wrote fiction.
 


387
0:17:22,47 --> 0:17:23,829
He wrote essays.
 


388
0:17:23,829 --> 0:17:25,42
He wrote social commentary.
 


389
0:17:25,42 --> 0:17:28,238
As an example,
he wrote a piece on British


390
0:17:28,238 --> 0:17:32,18
cruelty in the East Indies and
Africa and against native


391
0:17:32,18 --> 0:17:34,108
Americans,
writing, quote,


392
0:17:34,108 --> 0:17:38,275
"When I reflect on these I
hesitate not for a moment to


393
0:17:38,275 --> 0:17:42,441
believe that the Almighty will
finally separate America from


394
0:17:42,441 --> 0:17:43,358
Britain.
 


395
0:17:43,358 --> 0:17:46,838
Call it Independence or what
you will, if it is the cause of


396
0:17:46,838 --> 0:17:49,14
God and humanity it will go
on."


397
0:17:49,14 --> 0:17:51,4
Now considering--I'm going to
talk a little bit more about the


398
0:17:51,4 --> 0:17:52,881
fact that people aren't really
talking about independence at


399
0:17:52,881 --> 0:17:55,348
this point,
so that's a pretty bold


400
0:17:55,348 --> 0:17:58,259
statement before Common
Sense.


401
0:17:58,259 --> 0:18:2,509
Now one thing was noticeable
about Paine's writings.


402
0:18:2,509 --> 0:18:5,471
And that is that when they
seemed to strike at issues of


403
0:18:5,471 --> 0:18:7,483
American liberty,
even indirectly,


404
0:18:7,483 --> 0:18:9,47
even seemingly through
metaphor--


405
0:18:9,47 --> 0:18:12,846
as in one essay that talked
about British domination of


406
0:18:12,846 --> 0:18:16,411
India but everybody assumed
India must really be the North


407
0:18:16,411 --> 0:18:19,276
American colonies--
whenever he was referencing any


408
0:18:19,276 --> 0:18:22,98
of that sort of thing,
sales jumped.


409
0:18:22,98 --> 0:18:24,72
Everyone wanted to read those
essays.


410
0:18:24,72 --> 0:18:28,637
And ultimately it was some of
those essays that brought Paine


411
0:18:28,637 --> 0:18:30,99
to the attention of Benjamin
Rush.


412
0:18:30,99 --> 0:18:33,634
Rush went to that same
bookstore, the magical


413
0:18:33,634 --> 0:18:36,38
bookstore, the center of Paine's
life.


414
0:18:36,38 --> 0:18:39,38
He happened to meet Paine at
that same bookstore--so the


415
0:18:39,38 --> 0:18:42,38
moral is it's a good thing to
hang out in bookstores.


416
0:18:42,38 --> 0:18:46,317
And through their conversations
Rush later wrote that at the


417
0:18:46,317 --> 0:18:50,32
time he observed that,
quote, "Paine had realized


418
0:18:50,32 --> 0:18:53,164
the independance of the American
colonies upon Great


419
0:18:53,164 --> 0:18:55,559
Britain"
even at that time and that


420
0:18:55,559 --> 0:18:59,429
"he considered the measure
as necessary to bring the war to


421
0:18:59,429 --> 0:19:2,68
a speedy and successful
issue."


422
0:19:2,68 --> 0:19:3,583
So he meets Paine and one of
the things he notices is well,


423
0:19:3,583 --> 0:19:5,68
this guy's already kind of
thinking about independence.


424
0:19:5,68 --> 0:19:9,641
Paine himself later wrote about
his opinion of the colonies upon


425
0:19:9,641 --> 0:19:12,432
his arrival,
and he said that the thing that


426
0:19:12,432 --> 0:19:15,509
most struck him was how loyal
the colonists were to Great


427
0:19:15,509 --> 0:19:18,808
Britain,
and this is, Paine's words here.


428
0:19:18,808 --> 0:19:21,372
"I found the disposition
of the people such,


429
0:19:21,372 --> 0:19:24,469
that they might have been led
by a thread and governed by a


430
0:19:24,469 --> 0:19:24,95
reed.
 


431
0:19:24,95 --> 0:19:27,16
Their suspicion was quick and
penetrating,


432
0:19:27,16 --> 0:19:29,598
but their attachment to Britain
was obstinate,


433
0:19:29,598 --> 0:19:33,78
and it was at that time a kind
of treason to speak against it.


434
0:19:33,78 --> 0:19:37,299
They disliked the ministry,
but they esteemed the


435
0:19:37,299 --> 0:19:38,618
nation."
 


436
0:19:38,618 --> 0:19:39,958
I think that's a really
important point:


437
0:19:39,958 --> 0:19:41,776
"They disliked the
ministry but they esteemed the


438
0:19:41,776 --> 0:19:42,358
nation."
 


439
0:19:42,358 --> 0:19:45,882
"Their idea of grievance
operated without resentment,


440
0:19:45,882 --> 0:19:48,91
and their single object was
reconciliation ....


441
0:19:48,91 --> 0:19:51,368
I viewed the dispute as a kind
of law-suit.


442
0:19:51,368 --> 0:19:54,782
I supposed the parties would
find a way either to decide or


443
0:19:54,782 --> 0:19:55,49
settle it.
 


444
0:19:55,49 --> 0:19:58,67
I had no thoughts of
independence or of arms.


445
0:19:58,67 --> 0:20:1,81
The world could not then have
persuaded me that I should be


446
0:20:1,81 --> 0:20:3,868
either a soldier or an
author."


447
0:20:3,868 --> 0:20:6,77
Ultimately, it was the battle
of Lexington that changed


448
0:20:6,77 --> 0:20:8,167
Paine's view,
and his life,


449
0:20:8,167 --> 0:20:10,21
as it changed that of many
others.


450
0:20:10,21 --> 0:20:12,17
As Paine put it,
"when the country,


451
0:20:12,17 --> 0:20:15,412
into which I had just set my
foot, was set on fire about my


452
0:20:15,412 --> 0:20:17,769
ears,
it was time to stir."


453
0:20:17,769 --> 0:20:21,625
And so it's at this point that
Paine begins to tinker with the


454
0:20:21,625 --> 0:20:23,46
idea of writing a pamphlet.
 


455
0:20:23,46 --> 0:20:26,75
And apparently he spoke with
Benjamin Rush about it,


456
0:20:26,75 --> 0:20:29,963
and Rush later recalled in a
letter to a friend that he


457
0:20:29,963 --> 0:20:33,595
offered Paine one overall piece
of advice at the outset of the


458
0:20:33,595 --> 0:20:34,308
project.
 


459
0:20:34,308 --> 0:20:36,919
He said to Paine,
"there were two words


460
0:20:36,919 --> 0:20:40,499
which he should avoid by every
means as necessary to his own


461
0:20:40,499 --> 0:20:42,622
safety and that of the
public,"


462
0:20:42,622 --> 0:20:45,413
and the two words were
"independence"


463
0:20:45,413 --> 0:20:47,72
and "republicanism."
 


464
0:20:47,72 --> 0:20:49,89
Okay, and if you think about
Common Sense,


465
0:20:49,89 --> 0:20:52,108
he didn't listen to that
advice at all.


466
0:20:52,108 --> 0:20:54,892
And as a matter of fact it's
impossible to know what went


467
0:20:54,892 --> 0:20:56,779
through Paine's mind at that
moment.


468
0:20:56,779 --> 0:20:58,88
He certainly--He knew the
colonies were,


469
0:20:58,88 --> 0:21:1,137
as he put it,
on fire, he knew that popular


470
0:21:1,137 --> 0:21:3,72
sentiment was building even
against the King,


471
0:21:3,72 --> 0:21:6,769
but knowing his personality
it's entirely possible that if


472
0:21:6,769 --> 0:21:8,675
Rush said to him,
'Whatever you do,


473
0:21:8,675 --> 0:21:11,63
don't mention independence,'
that Paine's reaction might have


474
0:21:11,63 --> 0:21:13,318
been well,
that's at the center of it,


475
0:21:13,318 --> 0:21:13,69
isn't it?
 


476
0:21:13,69 --> 0:21:16,265
So that's it;
that's going to be what I write


477
0:21:16,265 --> 0:21:17,805
about, isn't it,
and it's going to be


478
0:21:17,805 --> 0:21:18,49
independence.
 


479
0:21:18,49 --> 0:21:21,272
And he might have deliberately
done the precise thing he was


480
0:21:21,272 --> 0:21:23,391
asked not to do,
and focus on the most


481
0:21:23,391 --> 0:21:26,941
controversial issue that seemed
to be at the very heart of the


482
0:21:26,941 --> 0:21:30,117
controversy that seemed to be,
certainly to Paine,


483
0:21:30,117 --> 0:21:33,526
lurking right underneath the
surface of this prevailing


484
0:21:33,526 --> 0:21:35,23
constitutional argument.
 


485
0:21:35,23 --> 0:21:39,586
So Paine wrote the pamphlet,
he read parts of it to Rush as


486
0:21:39,586 --> 0:21:43,643
he did, and Common Sense
is published in January


487
0:21:43,643 --> 0:21:44,318
1776.
 


488
0:21:44,318 --> 0:21:46,818
And I did state correctly
earlier that he wanted to call


489
0:21:46,818 --> 0:21:49,364
it Plain Truth and
Benjamin Rush thought Common


490
0:21:49,364 --> 0:21:52,259
Sense was a better title,
and I agree with Benjamin Rush.


491
0:21:52,259 --> 0:21:53,98
I like Common Sense
better.


492
0:21:53,98 --> 0:21:59,1
The pamphlet--The main argument
of the pamphlet did three


493
0:21:59,1 --> 0:21:59,808
things.
 


494
0:21:59,808 --> 0:22:3,224
So number one,
it basically refuted the


495
0:22:3,224 --> 0:22:6,818
prevailing ideas against
independence.


496
0:22:6,818 --> 0:22:11,8
It went one step further and
demonstrated the necessity of


497
0:22:11,8 --> 0:22:15,21
independence and how possible it
was.


498
0:22:15,21 --> 0:22:19,38
And it demonstrated the
stupidity and utter uselessness


499
0:22:19,38 --> 0:22:22,866
not only of the English monarchy
but just of monarchies


500
0:22:22,866 --> 0:22:23,858
generally.
 


501
0:22:23,858 --> 0:22:27,747
This is a radical message,
and it was written in a


502
0:22:27,747 --> 0:22:32,347
radically simple style aimed at
being accessible to a broad


503
0:22:32,347 --> 0:22:33,38
audience.
 


504
0:22:33,38 --> 0:22:36,696
This was all the more radical
given that American independence


505
0:22:36,696 --> 0:22:39,959
had not really been seriously
discussed by the great majority


506
0:22:39,959 --> 0:22:43,166
of colonists with the exception
of some extreme radicals who


507
0:22:43,166 --> 0:22:46,48
I've been mentioning now and
again in lectures.


508
0:22:46,48 --> 0:22:50,507
So let's look for just a minute
at how Paine went through the


509
0:22:50,507 --> 0:22:53,434
three parts of his argument--
and in a sense,


510
0:22:53,434 --> 0:22:55,19
there's three parts of his
argument,


511
0:22:55,19 --> 0:22:58,39
and the pamphlet itself has
three sections.


512
0:22:58,39 --> 0:23:1,762
And the first section of the
pamphlet centers on getting


513
0:23:1,762 --> 0:23:5,12
people past this ongoing
constitutional argument about


514
0:23:5,12 --> 0:23:8,57
the proper relationship between
the colonies and the mother


515
0:23:8,57 --> 0:23:9,43
country.
 


516
0:23:9,43 --> 0:23:12,928
And to accomplish this,
Paine did something amazingly


517
0:23:12,928 --> 0:23:13,4
bold.
 


518
0:23:13,4 --> 0:23:17,878
He just tossed aside the entire
idea of focusing on the English


519
0:23:17,878 --> 0:23:22,72
constitution as the context for
determining the fate of America,


520
0:23:22,72 --> 0:23:25,545
and rather than going on and on
and on with the same


521
0:23:25,545 --> 0:23:28,906
constitutional debate,
he began his pamphlet with an


522
0:23:28,906 --> 0:23:32,657
attack not only against King
George but also against the


523
0:23:32,657 --> 0:23:34,5
entire idea of monarchy.
 


524
0:23:34,5 --> 0:23:38,509
And he had a couple strategic
reasons for choosing to do this.


525
0:23:38,509 --> 0:23:42,673
First, the Crown was the last
remaining emotional and


526
0:23:42,673 --> 0:23:47,638
political link that was really
tying the colonies to the mother


527
0:23:47,638 --> 0:23:48,598
country.
 


528
0:23:48,598 --> 0:23:51,803
By this point,
the colonists had lost faith in


529
0:23:51,803 --> 0:23:54,759
Parliament,
so Paine certainly knew that if


530
0:23:54,759 --> 0:23:58,68
he could strike at this last
linchpin of colonial sentiment,


531
0:23:58,68 --> 0:24:2,298
he could advance the cause of
independence.


532
0:24:2,298 --> 0:24:7,407
Second, if Paine could destroy
the legitimacy not only of King


533
0:24:7,407 --> 0:24:11,68
George but also of the idea of
monarchy overall,


534
0:24:11,68 --> 0:24:15,7
then the English constitution's
legitimacy would suffer as well,


535
0:24:15,7 --> 0:24:19,528
once again hopefully opening
the way for independence.


536
0:24:19,528 --> 0:24:22,288
And then third,
I think equally important,


537
0:24:22,288 --> 0:24:26,578
rhetorically Paine had a really
good writer's sense of pacing,


538
0:24:26,578 --> 0:24:29,944
and he knew that if he opened
this pamphlet with this really


539
0:24:29,944 --> 0:24:33,366
dramatic challenge to all of the
prevailing assumptions about


540
0:24:33,366 --> 0:24:35,942
government,
and if he turned all of these


541
0:24:35,942 --> 0:24:39,484
assumptions on their head,
he would pull readers in to his


542
0:24:39,484 --> 0:24:43,355
pamphlet and in to his argument
immediately and hold them there


543
0:24:43,355 --> 0:24:46,994
for the center of his argument,
which was the second section of


544
0:24:46,994 --> 0:24:48,807
the pamphlet,
and that is really the part


545
0:24:48,807 --> 0:24:50,38
that focuses on independence.
 


546
0:24:50,38 --> 0:24:54,388
Independence at this point was
a topic that people didn't


547
0:24:54,388 --> 0:24:55,71
discuss openly.
 


548
0:24:55,71 --> 0:24:57,49
They didn't talk about it in
public.


549
0:24:57,49 --> 0:25:0,361
If discussed at all,
it was discussed privately


550
0:25:0,361 --> 0:25:3,92
among friends because basically
it amounted to treason.


551
0:25:3,92 --> 0:25:7,974
Paine's dramatic introduction
opened the way for him to


552
0:25:7,974 --> 0:25:11,278
introduce this really
controversial topic.


553
0:25:11,278 --> 0:25:15,44
If the English constitution
lacked legitimacy,


554
0:25:15,44 --> 0:25:16,548
well, what next?
 


555
0:25:16,548 --> 0:25:19,39
And his answer obviously is:
well, independence,


556
0:25:19,39 --> 0:25:20,778
the obvious solution.
 


557
0:25:20,778 --> 0:25:23,885
Which then brings us to the
third section of the


558
0:25:23,885 --> 0:25:26,2
pamphlet--and that is the
future.


559
0:25:26,2 --> 0:25:31,68
Paine concludes the pamphlet by
discussing just what Americans


560
0:25:31,68 --> 0:25:35,46
could institute to replace the
English constitution,


561
0:25:35,46 --> 0:25:38,97
what kind of government they
might be able to construct to


562
0:25:38,97 --> 0:25:39,95
replace what they were stripping
away.


563
0:25:39,95 --> 0:25:46,125
Now throughout his work Paine
hammered away at old ideas and


564
0:25:46,125 --> 0:25:48,43
propounded new ones.
 


565
0:25:48,43 --> 0:25:51,289
He argued that America was
distinct from England,


566
0:25:51,289 --> 0:25:54,567
that it was multicultural,
that it actually was more the


567
0:25:54,567 --> 0:25:57,309
child of Europe than the child
of England.


568
0:25:57,309 --> 0:25:59,539
He promoted American commerce.
 


569
0:25:59,539 --> 0:26:1,69
He promoted social mobility.
 


570
0:26:1,69 --> 0:26:5,303
He praised the innocence of the
New World as compared with the


571
0:26:5,303 --> 0:26:7,91
corruption and decadence of the
Old World.


572
0:26:7,91 --> 0:26:12,372
He struck at the trappings of
monarchy, things like hereditary


573
0:26:12,372 --> 0:26:14,64
privilege and court intrigue.
 


574
0:26:14,64 --> 0:26:18,603
He was an individualist arguing
that society was made of


575
0:26:18,603 --> 0:26:22,711
individuals who should all be
able to strive for their own


576
0:26:22,711 --> 0:26:23,358
good.
 


577
0:26:23,358 --> 0:26:27,604
He wasn't arguing that families
or patron-client relationships


578
0:26:27,604 --> 0:26:30,38
should define society any
longer.


579
0:26:30,38 --> 0:26:33,926
He depicted government as a
kind of necessary evil that was


580
0:26:33,926 --> 0:26:37,9
prone to create bureaucracies
and privilege.


581
0:26:37,9 --> 0:26:38,702
As he put it,
"Government,


582
0:26:38,702 --> 0:26:41,41
like dress, is the badge of
lost innocence,"


583
0:26:41,41 --> 0:26:44,4
so it's the price we pay for
being flawed beings.


584
0:26:44,4 --> 0:26:48,89
And he seemed to speak of an
American millennium,


585
0:26:48,89 --> 0:26:51,548
speaking of America as God's
chosen people.


586
0:26:51,548 --> 0:26:55,318
Paine argued that America's
success was linked to the


587
0:26:55,318 --> 0:26:59,326
success of all humankind,
that the American colonists


588
0:26:59,326 --> 0:27:2,838
could launch a worldwide
democratic revolution.


589
0:27:2,838 --> 0:27:5,68
And, as he put it--I'll quote
it again,


590
0:27:5,68 --> 0:27:7,815
but I think maybe it was the
first lecture that I quoted this


591
0:27:7,815 --> 0:27:10,11
as my sort of random
inspirational sentences from


592
0:27:10,11 --> 0:27:11,98
random guy from the eighteenth
century.


593
0:27:11,98 --> 0:27:14,288
This is where this comes from.
 


594
0:27:14,288 --> 0:27:17,246
It's the statement about
beginning the world anew:


595
0:27:17,246 --> 0:27:20,926
"We have every opportunity
and every encouragement before


596
0:27:20,926 --> 0:27:23,6
us,
to form the noblest purest


597
0:27:23,6 --> 0:27:25,538
constitution on the face of the
earth.


598
0:27:25,538 --> 0:27:28,384
We have it in our power to
begin the world over


599
0:27:28,384 --> 0:27:31,849
again....The birthday of a new
world is at hand."


600
0:27:31,849 --> 0:27:33,788
That's millennial talk there.
 


601
0:27:33,788 --> 0:27:38,152
The power of the pamphlet
wasn't just in its argument or


602
0:27:38,152 --> 0:27:42,597
in specific points of argument,
but rather, it was in the way


603
0:27:42,597 --> 0:27:45,68
that it reversed prevailing
assumptions.


604
0:27:45,68 --> 0:27:49,27
Paine forced readers to
consider a whole new way of


605
0:27:49,27 --> 0:27:53,63
looking at the impending
crisis--and actually at the


606
0:27:53,63 --> 0:27:55,2
entire imperial system.
 


607
0:27:55,2 --> 0:28:0,98
He laid bare assumptions that
had led colonists to resist


608
0:28:0,98 --> 0:28:3,144
independence,
and then by exposing these


609
0:28:3,144 --> 0:28:5,548
biases and holding them up to
scorn,


610
0:28:5,548 --> 0:28:9,892
he forced people to think
beyond what they had thought


611
0:28:9,892 --> 0:28:10,63
before.
 


612
0:28:10,63 --> 0:28:15,73
So basically the old paradigm
had been: liberty can survive


613
0:28:15,73 --> 0:28:19,746
among brutal and self-interested
men only through a balance of


614
0:28:19,746 --> 0:28:24,419
institutionalized forces so no
one can monopolize the power of


615
0:28:24,419 --> 0:28:27,788
the state and rule without
opposition.


616
0:28:27,788 --> 0:28:29,795
So monarchy,
nobility, and the people have


617
0:28:29,795 --> 0:28:32,338
an equal right to share in the
struggle for power;


618
0:28:32,338 --> 0:28:35,58
complexity in government in
this sense is a good thing;


619
0:28:35,58 --> 0:28:37,318
simplicity allows for
monopolization.


620
0:28:37,318 --> 0:28:41,96
Well, Paine argues,
complexity is not a virtue in


621
0:28:41,96 --> 0:28:42,118
government.
 


622
0:28:42,118 --> 0:28:45,67
It simply makes it impossible
to tell who is at fault.


623
0:28:45,67 --> 0:28:49,13
Paine charged that the
complexity of the British


624
0:28:49,13 --> 0:28:53,99
government was designed to serve
the monarchy and the nobility,


625
0:28:53,99 --> 0:28:57,56
that the King did nothing but
wage war and hand out gifts to


626
0:28:57,56 --> 0:29:0,597
his followers,
and that this entire idea of


627
0:29:0,597 --> 0:29:3,108
British
constitutional-institutional


628
0:29:3,108 --> 0:29:4,759
balance was a fraud.
 


629
0:29:4,759 --> 0:29:8,155
Now the boldness of this
message becomes clearer when you


630
0:29:8,155 --> 0:29:11,308
compare it with some other
pamphlets of the time,


631
0:29:11,308 --> 0:29:15,42
many of which were aimed at
exploring difficult questions--


632
0:29:15,42 --> 0:29:18,367
right?--constitutional issues,
and then coming up with


633
0:29:18,367 --> 0:29:19,368
recommendations.
 


634
0:29:19,368 --> 0:29:22,84
Common Sense isn't about
exploring difficult


635
0:29:22,84 --> 0:29:23,548
constitutional questions.
 


636
0:29:23,548 --> 0:29:26,153
It aimed to,
quote, "tear the world


637
0:29:26,153 --> 0:29:27,88
apart."
 


638
0:29:27,88 --> 0:29:31,365
This pamphlet did not have the
kind of rational tone and


639
0:29:31,365 --> 0:29:33,517
lawyerly,
precise logic and high


640
0:29:33,517 --> 0:29:36,449
scholarship that you see
floating through a lot of the


641
0:29:36,449 --> 0:29:38,328
other pamphlets of this period.
 


642
0:29:38,328 --> 0:29:42,397
And the tone was part of why
the pamphlet ended up being so


643
0:29:42,397 --> 0:29:43,24
effective.
 


644
0:29:43,24 --> 0:29:45,538
Paine didn't use legal
arguments.


645
0:29:45,538 --> 0:29:48,13
He didn't invoke legal
authorities.


646
0:29:48,13 --> 0:29:51,972
He assumed that his readers
would have some kind of limited


647
0:29:51,972 --> 0:29:53,63
knowledge of the Bible.
 


648
0:29:53,63 --> 0:29:55,88
He didn't use a lot of Latin,
and if he did use Latin he


649
0:29:55,88 --> 0:29:58,48
tended to follow it up with an
English translation.


650
0:29:58,48 --> 0:30:1,791
He used really straightforward
syntax, a really simple


651
0:30:1,791 --> 0:30:2,71
vocabulary.
 


652
0:30:2,71 --> 0:30:6,24
As he himself explained it:
"As it is my design to


653
0:30:6,24 --> 0:30:9,38
make those that can scarcely
read understand,


654
0:30:9,38 --> 0:30:12,96
I shall therefore avoid every
literary ornament,


655
0:30:12,96 --> 0:30:15,69
and put it in language as plain
as the alphabet."


656
0:30:15,69 --> 0:30:18,733
So what he wanted to write he
said was, quote,


657
0:30:18,733 --> 0:30:21,103
"simple facts,
plain arguments,


658
0:30:21,103 --> 0:30:22,93
and common sense."
 


659
0:30:22,93 --> 0:30:26,944
Sometimes it was Paine's
irreverence in comparison with


660
0:30:26,944 --> 0:30:31,778
other pamphlet writers that made
his writing seem so effective.


661
0:30:31,778 --> 0:30:33,915
So for example,
writing about the origins of


662
0:30:33,915 --> 0:30:36,4
the English monarchy and William
the Conqueror,


663
0:30:36,4 --> 0:30:39,34
Paine wrote,
"no man in his senses can


664
0:30:39,34 --> 0:30:42,609
say that their claim under
William the Conqueror is a very


665
0:30:42,609 --> 0:30:43,74
honorable one.
 


666
0:30:43,74 --> 0:30:46,73
A French bastard landing with
an armed banditti,


667
0:30:46,73 --> 0:30:49,342
and establishing himself king
of England against the consent


668
0:30:49,342 --> 0:30:52,48
of the natives,
is in plain terms a very paltry


669
0:30:52,48 --> 0:30:54,368
rascally original."
 


670
0:30:54,368 --> 0:30:54,611
Okay.
 


671
0:30:54,611 --> 0:30:56,16
It's not your typical pamphlet.
 


672
0:30:56,16 --> 0:30:59,964
Sometimes he used really
straightforward language just


673
0:30:59,964 --> 0:31:3,101
for shock value,
trying to make his point


674
0:31:3,101 --> 0:31:5,98
by--trying to upset prevailing
ideas--


675
0:31:5,98 --> 0:31:9,21
by saying something in a
shockingly straightforward and


676
0:31:9,21 --> 0:31:10,15
irreverent manner.
 


677
0:31:10,15 --> 0:31:12,777
And that's obviously going to
be really effective if he was


678
0:31:12,777 --> 0:31:15,451
talking about the King--to use
sort of shockingly irreverent


679
0:31:15,451 --> 0:31:16,38
language.
 


680
0:31:16,38 --> 0:31:18,386
So for example,
he really tried hard to


681
0:31:18,386 --> 0:31:21,468
dehumanize King George III,
writing for example,


682
0:31:21,468 --> 0:31:24,91
he has "sunk himself
beneath the rank of animals,


683
0:31:24,91 --> 0:31:28,64
and contemptibly crawls through
the world like a worm."


684
0:31:28,64 --> 0:31:28,911
Okay.
 


685
0:31:28,911 --> 0:31:30,647
[laughs]
That's pretty irreverent


686
0:31:30,647 --> 0:31:31,298
language.
 


687
0:31:31,298 --> 0:31:34,118
"Even brutes do not devour
their young."


688
0:31:34,118 --> 0:31:34,375
Okay.
 


689
0:31:34,375 --> 0:31:36,637
That would have been really
shocking [laughs]


690
0:31:36,637 --> 0:31:39,67
to someone to read at the time,
that that's a description of


691
0:31:39,67 --> 0:31:40,39
the King.
 


692
0:31:40,39 --> 0:31:43,828
Or he used sarcasm,
as in this sentence.


693
0:31:43,828 --> 0:31:46,35
Now I mentioned this
sentence--I don't know--in the


694
0:31:46,35 --> 0:31:47,578
first--one of the early
lectures.


695
0:31:47,578 --> 0:31:50,958
I talked about a sentence that
I really liked and I accused


696
0:31:50,958 --> 0:31:53,93
Benjamin Rush of cutting it out
of the pamphlet,


697
0:31:53,93 --> 0:31:56,171
and I'm here to redeem Benjamin
Rush because when I looked this


698
0:31:56,171 --> 0:31:58,338
up today to double check on
myself what I discovered was,


699
0:31:58,338 --> 0:32:1,41
this is actually Benjamin
Rush's favorite sentence and


700
0:32:1,41 --> 0:32:3,38
Benjamin Franklin struck it out.
 


701
0:32:3,38 --> 0:32:5,568
[laughs]
So it was in the draft but it


702
0:32:5,568 --> 0:32:8,705
didn't make the final printed
copy of Common Sense,


703
0:32:8,705 --> 0:32:10,66
and this is the sentence.
 


704
0:32:10,66 --> 0:32:10,939
Okay.
 


705
0:32:10,939 --> 0:32:13,788
"A greater absurdity
cannot be conceived of,


706
0:32:13,788 --> 0:32:16,663
than three millions of people
running to their seacoast every


707
0:32:16,663 --> 0:32:19,64
time a ship arrives from London,
to know what portion of liberty


708
0:32:19,64 --> 0:32:20,69
they should enjoy."
 


709
0:32:20,69 --> 0:32:22,309
I think that's a good sentence.
 


710
0:32:22,309 --> 0:32:23,69
I agree with Rush.
 


711
0:32:23,69 --> 0:32:24,18
I think Franklin had it wrong.
 


712
0:32:24,18 --> 0:32:26,768
I think that's good sort of
pointed sarcasm,


713
0:32:26,768 --> 0:32:30,14
so I'm sorry it didn't make the
final printed version.


714
0:32:30,14 --> 0:32:31,318
Rush is right.
 


715
0:32:31,318 --> 0:32:33,862
So sarcasm--effecti
ve--irreverence,


716
0:32:33,862 --> 0:32:35,97
shock value--all effective.
 


717
0:32:35,97 --> 0:32:38,588
Even just emotion,
even Paine's emotion,


718
0:32:38,588 --> 0:32:41,19
was effective because it was so
strong,


719
0:32:41,19 --> 0:32:43,624
because he was so passionate,
and because he was so


720
0:32:43,624 --> 0:32:46,608
straightforward,
as in a sentence like this.


721
0:32:46,608 --> 0:32:51,82
"Every thing that is right
or reasonable pleads for


722
0:32:51,82 --> 0:32:52,14
separation.
 


723
0:32:52,14 --> 0:32:55,776
The blood of the slain,
the weeping voice of nature


724
0:32:55,776 --> 0:32:59,193
cries, 'TIS TIME TO PART.'"
Okay, dramatic,


725
0:32:59,193 --> 0:33:1,74
passionate, emotional language.
 


726
0:33:1,74 --> 0:33:4,89
So all of this stuff that I'm
describing here,


727
0:33:4,89 --> 0:33:6,23
all of this rhetoric,
all of this logic,


728
0:33:6,23 --> 0:33:9,22
all of the sort of rationale
behind this pamphlet--


729
0:33:9,22 --> 0:33:13,19
this is popular culture but
it's not low culture.


730
0:33:13,19 --> 0:33:16,714
It may not have had really
refined language but it had


731
0:33:16,714 --> 0:33:18,38
correct language.
 


732
0:33:18,38 --> 0:33:22,416
As Thomas Jefferson put it,
"No writer has exceeded


733
0:33:22,416 --> 0:33:25,759
Paine in ease and familiarity of
style,


734
0:33:25,759 --> 0:33:29,858
in perspicuity of expression,
happiness of elucidation,


735
0:33:29,858 --> 0:33:32,78
and in simple and unassuming
language."


736
0:33:32,78 --> 0:33:32,4
Okay.
 


737
0:33:32,4 --> 0:33:35,93
By writing that,
Jefferson achieved none of


738
0:33:35,93 --> 0:33:36,118
those things.
 


739
0:33:36,118 --> 0:33:37,576
[laughs]
That's like a really good


740
0:33:37,576 --> 0:33:40,224
example of how different Paine
sounded, [laughs]--perspicuity


741
0:33:40,224 --> 0:33:42,299
of expression and happiness of
elucidation.


742
0:33:42,299 --> 0:33:44,328
Okay, not in Common Sense.
 


743
0:33:44,328 --> 0:33:47,78
Jefferson does not sound
like Thomas Paine.


744
0:33:47,78 --> 0:33:50,95
Given all of this,
the widespread popularity of


745
0:33:50,95 --> 0:33:54,94
the pamphlet isn't surprising,
and the first printing sold out


746
0:33:54,94 --> 0:33:55,338
in a few weeks.
 


747
0:33:55,338 --> 0:33:58,337
There were many re-printings,
first in Pennsylvania,


748
0:33:58,337 --> 0:34:1,63
then in other colonies,
and even ultimately in Europe.


749
0:34:1,63 --> 0:34:4,89
And all in all,
a majority of the population of


750
0:34:4,89 --> 0:34:8,786
the colonies either read
Common Sense or received


751
0:34:8,786 --> 0:34:13,39
some kind of distilled version
of it at their local tavern or


752
0:34:13,39 --> 0:34:16,541
in conversation,
as presented by other people


753
0:34:16,541 --> 0:34:17,679
who had read it.
 


754
0:34:17,679 --> 0:34:21,409
By March of 1776,
there had been 125,000 copies


755
0:34:21,409 --> 0:34:26,356
sold and by colonial standards
that's a mind-blowing number of


756
0:34:26,356 --> 0:34:29,137
copies,
and here's a way to sort of put


757
0:34:29,137 --> 0:34:30,13
that in context.
 


758
0:34:30,13 --> 0:34:33,139
At this period,
even later, even in the 1790s,


759
0:34:33,139 --> 0:34:36,79
in a city like New York or
Pennsylvania,


760
0:34:36,79 --> 0:34:40,5
a newspaper that would have
been considered to have a big


761
0:34:40,5 --> 0:34:42,938
circulation number--
like wow, that's a really big


762
0:34:42,938 --> 0:34:46,152
newspaper--
would have had a circulation of


763
0:34:46,152 --> 0:34:46,668
1,000.
 


764
0:34:46,668 --> 0:34:47,268
Okay.
 


765
0:34:47,268 --> 0:34:50,719
So 125,000 copies is a lot of
copies.


766
0:34:50,719 --> 0:34:53,13
That's a pretty remarkable
number.


767
0:34:53,13 --> 0:34:56,487
And sales were helped by the
fact that the pamphlet was


768
0:34:56,487 --> 0:34:59,846
priced really low so that it
could be bought by anyone,


769
0:34:59,846 --> 0:35:1,65
even the relatively poor.
 


770
0:35:1,65 --> 0:35:4,731
Now of course Paine wasn't shy
about his own accomplishments


771
0:35:4,731 --> 0:35:7,811
and he later told anybody who
would listen that his pamphlet


772
0:35:7,811 --> 0:35:10,572
had enjoyed,
quote, "the greatest sale


773
0:35:10,572 --> 0:35:13,757
that any performance [has]
ever had since the use of


774
0:35:13,757 --> 0:35:14,82
letters."
 


775
0:35:14,82 --> 0:35:15,682
[laughter]
Okay.


776
0:35:15,682 --> 0:35:17,179
That's not a modest man.
 


777
0:35:17,179 --> 0:35:20,789
It is the greatest-selling
thing of all time.


778
0:35:20,789 --> 0:35:21,15
Okay.
 


779
0:35:21,15 --> 0:35:23,969
Okay, Tom, it's important but
come on.


780
0:35:23,969 --> 0:35:26,456
[laughter]
Now of course not everybody


781
0:35:26,456 --> 0:35:29,82
cheered with the publication of
Common Sense.


782
0:35:29,82 --> 0:35:33,297
There were many people who
were enraged at what it dared to


783
0:35:33,297 --> 0:35:36,719
say about the English monarch,
about the British constitution,


784
0:35:36,719 --> 0:35:38,1
about independence.
 


785
0:35:38,1 --> 0:35:40,94
Who was this guy anyway? Right?
 


786
0:35:40,94 --> 0:35:43,57
Who was he to promote
independence?


787
0:35:43,57 --> 0:35:47,621
As Samuel Adams put it with
actually unusual understatement


788
0:35:47,621 --> 0:35:50,43
for Samuel Adams--
he said the pamphlet,


789
0:35:50,43 --> 0:35:52,53
quote, "has fretted some
folks here more than a


790
0:35:52,53 --> 0:35:53,309
little."
 


791
0:35:53,309 --> 0:35:55,5
It upset a lot of people.
 


792
0:35:55,5 --> 0:35:58,954
More direct criticism was
issued by an English gentleman


793
0:35:58,954 --> 0:36:1,28
traveling in Virginia in his
diary.


794
0:36:1,28 --> 0:36:4,744
He wrote, "A pamphlet
called Common Sense makes


795
0:36:4,744 --> 0:36:5,699
a great noise.
 


796
0:36:5,699 --> 0:36:8,599
One of the vilest things that
ever was published to the world.


797
0:36:8,599 --> 0:36:13,192
Full of false representations,
lies, calumny,


798
0:36:13,192 --> 0:36:15,28
and treason."
 


799
0:36:15,28 --> 0:36:18,84
Now you may be surprised to
hear that John Adams,


800
0:36:18,84 --> 0:36:22,251
ultimately a leading proponent
of independence,


801
0:36:22,251 --> 0:36:24,699
did not like Common Sense.
 


802
0:36:24,699 --> 0:36:26,829
John Adams did not like the
pamphlet.


803
0:36:26,829 --> 0:36:29,17
It wasn't because of the first
two parts.


804
0:36:29,17 --> 0:36:29,639
Right?
 


805
0:36:29,639 --> 0:36:32,39
He's all for questioning the
British constitution.


806
0:36:32,39 --> 0:36:33,88
He's all for independence.
 


807
0:36:33,88 --> 0:36:36,885
That's fine,
but what really got Adams was


808
0:36:36,885 --> 0:36:39,599
the third section of the
pamphlet,


809
0:36:39,599 --> 0:36:42,679
the section about what kind of
government might we be able to


810
0:36:42,679 --> 0:36:45,349
create in the absence of the
British constitution.


811
0:36:45,349 --> 0:36:48,626
This made Adams crazy,
because to Adams and to many


812
0:36:48,626 --> 0:36:51,931
others at the time,
good lawmakers were supposed to


813
0:36:51,931 --> 0:36:55,295
always be practical thinkers and
they were supposed to be


814
0:36:55,295 --> 0:36:58,179
realistic about what a society
could achieve.


815
0:36:58,179 --> 0:37:1,168
They were supposed to think
about the realities of a society


816
0:37:1,168 --> 0:37:3,55
and then what would be
politically possible,


817
0:37:3,55 --> 0:37:5,369
and this is not what he thought
Paine was doing.


818
0:37:5,369 --> 0:37:8,483
He thought Paine was sort of
blue sky, unrealistic,


819
0:37:8,483 --> 0:37:10,478
tossings off about
possibilities,


820
0:37:10,478 --> 0:37:13,78
without thinking really hard
about probabilities.


821
0:37:13,78 --> 0:37:17,94
So this is John Adams' summary
of Common Sense.


822
0:37:17,94 --> 0:37:19,405
This is true John Adams.
 


823
0:37:19,405 --> 0:37:19,719
Okay.
 


824
0:37:19,719 --> 0:37:22,364
Common Sense,
quote, "a poor,


825
0:37:22,364 --> 0:37:24,545
ignorant, malicious,
shortsighted,


826
0:37:24,545 --> 0:37:26,199
crapulous mass."
 


827
0:37:26,199 --> 0:37:29,387
[laughs]
That's John Adams' opinion of


828
0:37:29,387 --> 0:37:30,94
Common Sense.
 


829
0:37:30,94 --> 0:37:34,54
I have to add here for no
reason except that when I was


830
0:37:34,54 --> 0:37:37,349
writing this I thought of it,
and then this is my excuse to


831
0:37:37,349 --> 0:37:39,789
mention it in a lecture,
and so I will.


832
0:37:39,789 --> 0:37:42,94
How many of you here have read
Plato's Republic?


833
0:37:42,94 --> 0:37:45,48
 Some of you have read
Plato's Republic.


834
0:37:45,48 --> 0:37:46,67
Okay.
 


835
0:37:46,67 --> 0:37:49,692
John Adams really did not like
Plato's Republic either,


836
0:37:49,692 --> 0:37:51,3
and for the same reasons.
 


837
0:37:51,3 --> 0:37:51,224
Right?
 


838
0:37:51,224 --> 0:37:52,4
He thought Plato was
irresponsible.


839
0:37:52,4 --> 0:37:53,909
He hated Plato's Republic.
 


840
0:37:53,909 --> 0:37:55,949
Jefferson was not a big fan
either.


841
0:37:55,949 --> 0:37:59,9
He thought that--Actually,
both of them thought that Plato


842
0:37:59,9 --> 0:38:2,233
was sort of vaporing about
political ideals and not really


843
0:38:2,233 --> 0:38:5,32
thinking about realistic
application to real people.


844
0:38:5,32 --> 0:38:8,797
So to these guys at this time
the real challenge of what


845
0:38:8,797 --> 0:38:11,96
they're doing is to match ideals
and realities,


846
0:38:11,96 --> 0:38:14,28
and they didn't think Plato was
doing that at all.


847
0:38:14,28 --> 0:38:16,791
So this is what Adams first had
to say about Plato's


848
0:38:16,791 --> 0:38:18,858
Republic:
 "While wading


849
0:38:18,858 --> 0:38:21,309
through the whimsies,
the puerilities,


850
0:38:21,309 --> 0:38:24,309
and unintelligible jargon of
this work,


851
0:38:24,309 --> 0:38:27,548
I laid it down often to ask
myself how it could have been


852
0:38:27,548 --> 0:38:30,498
that the world should have so
long consented to give


853
0:38:30,498 --> 0:38:33,159
reputation to such nonsense as
this."


854
0:38:33,159 --> 0:38:33,75
[laughter] Okay.
 


855
0:38:33,75 --> 0:38:36,474
He really doesn't like Plato's
Republic, but he also


856
0:38:36,474 --> 0:38:37,65
just didn't like Plato.
 


857
0:38:37,65 --> 0:38:41,795
So overall he said--he talked
about how he read all of Plato's


858
0:38:41,795 --> 0:38:45,237
works and he talked about oh,
he had three Latin dictionaries


859
0:38:45,237 --> 0:38:47,239
and a German one and a French
one just in case,


860
0:38:47,239 --> 0:38:50,648
and he worked his way through,
and he said he learned only two


861
0:38:50,648 --> 0:38:52,55
things from all of Plato's work.
 


862
0:38:52,55 --> 0:38:55,217
He learned, number one,
that Benjamin Franklin stole an


863
0:38:55,217 --> 0:38:58,286
idea from Plato [laughter]--
didn't give him credit,


864
0:38:58,286 --> 0:39:0,79
[laughs]
and number two,


865
0:39:0,79 --> 0:39:2,82
he learned that sneezing is a
cure for the hiccups.


866
0:39:2,82 --> 0:39:3,994
[laughter]
And he said,


867
0:39:3,994 --> 0:39:6,73
quote, "Accordingly,
I have cured myself and all my


868
0:39:6,73 --> 0:39:8,26
friends of that provoking
disorder,


869
0:39:8,26 --> 0:39:9,969
for thirty years,
with a pinch of snuff."


870
0:39:9,969 --> 0:39:10,342
Okay.
 


871
0:39:10,342 --> 0:39:12,429
That's Plato to John Adams.
 


872
0:39:12,429 --> 0:39:13,84
[laughs] That's it.
 


873
0:39:13,84 --> 0:39:15,159
So I just love that.
 


874
0:39:15,159 --> 0:39:15,679
I love that.
 


875
0:39:15,679 --> 0:39:16,94
It's John Adams at his best.
 


876
0:39:16,94 --> 0:39:17,268
Okay.
 


877
0:39:17,268 --> 0:39:20,23
So away from Plato,
back to Common Sense.


878
0:39:20,23 --> 0:39:23,905
 For many people Common
Sense was kind of a


879
0:39:23,905 --> 0:39:27,422
conversion experience,
and there are people that are


880
0:39:27,422 --> 0:39:30,3
fence sitters who maybe--
might have had the makings of a


881
0:39:30,3 --> 0:39:32,452
radical and in reading the
pamphlet or hearing of the


882
0:39:32,452 --> 0:39:34,797
pamphlet,
they actually were radicalized


883
0:39:34,797 --> 0:39:35,219
by it.
 


884
0:39:35,219 --> 0:39:36,92
It was talked of everywhere.
 


885
0:39:36,92 --> 0:39:39,385
As Rush put it,
"Its effects were sudden


886
0:39:39,385 --> 0:39:41,57
and extensive upon the American
mind.


887
0:39:41,57 --> 0:39:42,969
It was read by public men."
 


888
0:39:42,969 --> 0:39:46,59
It was "repeated in Clubs,
spouted in schools,


889
0:39:46,59 --> 0:39:49,177
and in one instance delivered
from the pulpit instead of a


890
0:39:49,177 --> 0:39:50,889
sermon,
by a clergyman in


891
0:39:50,889 --> 0:39:52,13
Connecticut."
 


892
0:39:52,13 --> 0:39:53,57
That's a Connecticut moment.
 


893
0:39:53,57 --> 0:39:56,505
I'm always happy when we have
little Connecticut or Yale


894
0:39:56,505 --> 0:39:57,39
moments.
 


895
0:39:57,39 --> 0:39:58,75
It was talked about everywhere.
 


896
0:39:58,75 --> 0:40:1,842
Its rhetoric was so powerful
that for many it inspired them


897
0:40:1,842 --> 0:40:4,324
to stand back,
examine their situation,


898
0:40:4,324 --> 0:40:7,409
and really loathe Britain for
the first time--


899
0:40:7,409 --> 0:40:9,239
like oh, [laughs]
I've never thought of loathing


900
0:40:9,239 --> 0:40:11,63
Britain before,
but yet now I am.


901
0:40:11,63 --> 0:40:14,16
As George Washington wrote,
Common Sense was


902
0:40:14,16 --> 0:40:17,17
"working a wonderful change
in the minds of many men."


903
0:40:17,17 --> 0:40:20,356
In the end, regardless of
whether one agreed or not with


904
0:40:20,356 --> 0:40:22,5
his argument,
Paine's pamphlet did one


905
0:40:22,5 --> 0:40:24,469
fundamentally important thing.
 


906
0:40:24,469 --> 0:40:27,753
He focused the prevailing
colonial political conversation


907
0:40:27,753 --> 0:40:28,809
on independence.
 


908
0:40:28,809 --> 0:40:33,639
He lifted the argument above
constitutional reckoning.


909
0:40:33,639 --> 0:40:37,114
He inspired others to write
about the topic as well,


910
0:40:37,114 --> 0:40:40,179
sometimes for independence,
sometimes against,


911
0:40:40,179 --> 0:40:43,789
but independence became now the
topic to discuss.


912
0:40:43,789 --> 0:40:47,135
As a reader in Boston put it,
"Independence a year ago


913
0:40:47,135 --> 0:40:50,309
could not have been publicly
mentioned with impunity.


914
0:40:50,309 --> 0:40:53,646
Nothing else is now talked of,
and I know not what can be done


915
0:40:53,646 --> 0:40:55,78
by Great Britain to prevent
it."


916
0:40:55,78 --> 0:40:59,284
Now Paine was all too happy to
remind anyone who would listen


917
0:40:59,284 --> 0:41:1,679
about the significance of his
pamphlet.


918
0:41:1,679 --> 0:41:3,929
He considered it his lifetime
achievement.


919
0:41:3,929 --> 0:41:7,3
He wanted his tombstone to read
"Thomas Paine,


920
0:41:7,3 --> 0:41:8,32
author of Common
Sense."


921
0:41:8,32 --> 0:41:10,96
Of course,
that was assuming he was going


922
0:41:10,96 --> 0:41:11,608
to have a tombstone which
[laughter]


923
0:41:11,608 --> 0:41:12,17
he didn't.
 


924
0:41:12,17 --> 0:41:13,719
[laughs] The poor guy.
 


925
0:41:13,719 --> 0:41:16,28
I didn't think of that until
this second--oh,


926
0:41:16,28 --> 0:41:16,98
bad irony.
 


927
0:41:16,98 --> 0:41:20,351
He said that regardless of
whatever form he took in the


928
0:41:20,351 --> 0:41:24,409
afterlife, he would always know
he had written Common Sense.


929
0:41:24,409 --> 0:41:28,119
Okay, but did Common Sense
cause independence?


930
0:41:28,119 --> 0:41:28,351
Okay.
 


931
0:41:28,351 --> 0:41:30,94
Paine clearly would have loved
to tell you that it did.


932
0:41:30,94 --> 0:41:34,3
That's the kind of conclusion
you really can't make,


933
0:41:34,3 --> 0:41:37,7
but clearly you can say it was
so powerful,


934
0:41:37,7 --> 0:41:40,3
so widely read,
so controversial that it


935
0:41:40,3 --> 0:41:43,981
shattered much of the
psychological resistance to the


936
0:41:43,981 --> 0:41:45,88
idea of independence.
 


937
0:41:45,88 --> 0:41:49,628
And also on a more social
level, Common Sense


938
0:41:49,628 --> 0:41:54,16
invited an entire range of
people into the political


939
0:41:54,16 --> 0:41:58,563
conversation that in some ways
hadn't really been included


940
0:41:58,563 --> 0:42:1,257
before,
just by deliberately making


941
0:42:1,257 --> 0:42:4,82
this pamphlet available to as
broad an audience as possible.


942
0:42:4,82 --> 0:42:9,458
And his message in a sense was
fundamentally democratizing as


943
0:42:9,458 --> 0:42:10,0
well.
 


944
0:42:10,0 --> 0:42:14,371
Paine preached that any people
can deliberate and decide how


945
0:42:14,371 --> 0:42:16,3
they are to be governed.
 


946
0:42:16,3 --> 0:42:18,8
And then they can act on that
choice.


947
0:42:18,8 --> 0:42:22,581
Any people are capable of
creating and implementing their


948
0:42:22,581 --> 0:42:23,73
own government.
 


949
0:42:23,73 --> 0:42:26,143
It's a powerful message,
and regardless of whether


950
0:42:26,143 --> 0:42:29,199
people agreed or disagreed about
what government they should be


951
0:42:29,199 --> 0:42:31,728
creating,
the ideas underlying that


952
0:42:31,728 --> 0:42:35,26
pamphlet in a sense were really
revolutionary,


953
0:42:35,26 --> 0:42:37,159
in a sense, and certainly
radicalizing,


954
0:42:37,159 --> 0:42:40,719
just at this moment when things
are taking a turn,


955
0:42:40,719 --> 0:42:43,603
just at this moment when the
King has declared the colonies


956
0:42:43,603 --> 0:42:45,94
in rebellion,
and very soon we're going to


957
0:42:45,94 --> 0:42:47,48
have Lexington and Concord.
 


958
0:42:47,48 --> 0:42:50,192
So you can see how we're right
at this moment where things are


959
0:42:50,192 --> 0:42:51,26
going to take a shift.
 


960
0:42:51,26 --> 0:42:53,237
Common Sense,
partly timing-wise,


961
0:42:53,237 --> 0:42:56,228
came out at just the moment
where it was going to strike and


962
0:42:56,228 --> 0:42:57,699
have the broadest impact.
 


963
0:42:57,699 --> 0:42:59,539
That is all I have for today.
 


964
0:42:59,539 --> 0:43:0,65
Have a good weekend.
 


965
0:43:0,65 --> 0:43:5,44
I will see you on Tuesday and
we will move on to independence.


966
0:43:5,44 --> 0:43:7,34
We get independence next week.
 


967
0:43:7,34 --> 0:43:8,5
It's very exciting.
 


968
0:43:8,5 --> 0:45:8,5
