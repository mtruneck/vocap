Ooo! Ooo!  A fossil PROVES fish to
tetrapod evolution, aren't you excited?

0:0:6,91 --> 0:0:12,26
Before that, we all were WORMS, open
flagrant bigotry in both academia, and in


3
0:0:12,26 --> 0:0:15,36
our mailbag!  This is Genesis Week!

[Music]


5
0:0:30,9 --> 0:0:35,43
And a welcome to this episode of Genesis
Week, the weekly program of creationary


6
0:0:35,43 --> 0:0:39,55
commentary on news, views and events
pertaining to the origins controversy,


7
0:0:39,55 --> 0:0:44,9
made possible by the supporters of CORE
Ottawa - Citizens for Origins Research


8
0:0:44,9 --> 0:0:50,16
and Education, and exclusive right here
on youtube.  Pirate broadcasting live from


9
0:0:50,16 --> 0:0:55,11
Superman's former secret fortress of
solitude in the Canadian high arctic - but


10
0:0:55,11 --> 0:0:58,13
we're a little worried about what's gonna
happen with our broadcast with all the


11
0:0:58,13 --> 0:1:2,23
solar flares going off and us being in the
arctic and stuff.  But we'll keep


12
0:1:2,23 --> 0:1:6,27
broadcasting the information the
anti-creationists don't want you to see or


13
0:1:6,27 --> 0:1:12,85
hear, and we'll give glory to the Creator
while doing it.  Once again, #1 most talked


14
0:1:12,85 --> 0:1:15,69

0:1:28,75 --> 0:1:31,83
your host, Ian Juby


19
0:1:31,83 --> 0:1:52,36
Stop me if you've heard this before!


20
0:1:52,36 --> 0:1:57,52
Oh how exciting!  What are they talking
about? Tiktaalik? No, but they are talking


21
0:1:57,52 --> 0:2:3,17
about another fossil in the long line of
alleged fishapods, which it seems I've


22
0:2:3,17 --> 0:2:7,21
wound up talking about for like, five or six
different shows!  You'd think the press


23
0:2:7,21 --> 0:2:10,4
and these particular evolutionists would
have learned their lesson by now!  But


24
0:2:10,4 --> 0:2:14,88
nope!  So what is it they're so excited
about?  Well, it is a pretty spectacular


25
0:2:14,88 --> 0:2:19,46
fossil find to be sure.  Found in Scotland,
these fossils allegedly fill in the famous


26
0:2:19,46 --> 0:2:25,49
"Romer's gap" which was named after Dr.
Alfred Romer, an American Paleontologist


27
0:2:25,49 --> 0:2:32,46
who noted missing fossils in the fishapod
timeline between 345 and 360 million


28
0:2:32,46 --> 0:2:35,95
years ago.  
Smithson, et al, reported on the Scottish


29
0:2:35,95 --> 0:2:41,35
fossil find in the latest PNAS, and the
fossils have been assigned the precise


30
0:2:41,35 --> 0:2:50,67
evolutionary age of 348 to 347.6 Ma - give
or take a week.  Particular excitement was


31
0:2:50,67 --> 0:3:26,55
over a fossil foot which had five toes.
Devin Powell of Science News explains:  


32
0:3:26,55 --> 0:3:32,64
Even in the PNAS article itself, the
authors allude to the "fact" that this is


33
0:3:32,64 --> 0:3:50,63
earliest evidence of a fossil five-toed foot:


34
0:3:50,63 --> 0:3:55,8
Wait - let's take a look at the evolutionary
timescale involved here.  I discussed this


35
0:3:55,8 --> 0:3:59,62
extensively on previous shows, but
apparently these researchers don't watch


36
0:3:59,62 --> 0:4:4,4
this show and thus miss out on the
valuable information we bring you that the


37
0:4:4,4 --> 0:4:6,58
anti-creationists don't want you to see or
hear!


38
0:4:6,58 --> 0:4:11,35
Here's a pretty diagram showing how the
evolution myth portrays fishapod


39
0:4:11,35 --> 0:4:17,34
evolution,  - and the approximate age that
has been assigned to the five-toed fossil


40
0:4:17,34 --> 0:4:23,34
foot that was just reported.  As we go
left-to-right on the chart, we go through


41
0:4:23,34 --> 0:4:28,28
evolutionary time as the fishees attempt
to grow legs and walk up on to land -


42
0:4:28,28 --> 0:4:33,29
allegedly culminating in the five-toed foot.
This gradual progression of evolution


43
0:4:33,29 --> 0:4:39,75
looks impressive in pretty pictures. To
falsify this myth, all we have to do is show


44
0:4:39,75 --> 0:4:45,43
that there were ALREADY five-toed
tetrapods before any of these creatures


45
0:4:45,43 --> 0:4:50,75
appeared in the evolutionary timeline.  And
that is precisely what was already done


46
0:4:50,75 --> 0:4:57,82
years to decades earlier.  In 2010, a report
was published - by evolutionists - of fossil


47
0:4:57,82 --> 0:5:4,12
tetrapod footprints in Poland dated 395
MILLION years old, according to the


48
0:5:4,12 --> 0:5:8,97
evolution myth. Those footprints were
actually first found in 2002, and take a


49
0:5:8,97 --> 0:5:13,34
look and count'em yourself - 1- 1 toe! hahaha!
toes!  But yet the creationists were way


50
0:5:13,34 --> 0:5:19,18
2! 2 toes! mwahahahaha! 3! 3 toes! hahaha
oh enough of that.


51
0:5:19,18 --> 0:5:22,2
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 toes!  
But yet the creationists were way


52
0:5:22,2 --> 0:5:27,13
ahead of the pack, with geologist John
Mackay publicizing fossil tetrapod tracks


53
0:5:27,13 --> 0:5:32,88
in the Tapeats sandstone of Grand
Canyon in 1987!  The Tapeats sandstone


54
0:5:32,88 --> 0:5:39,62
is dated according to the evolution myth
as 525 million years old - that's way off


55
0:5:39,62 --> 0:5:44,38
the other end of our chart. Notice that the
Scottish researchers have interpreted the


56
0:5:44,38 --> 0:5:49,48
fossil foot as having a reduced fifth toe,
and also notice that the Polish


57
0:5:49,48 --> 0:5:53,14
researchers interpreted the same thing
from their footprint, and also the


58
0:5:53,14 --> 0:5:56,86
reconstruction of Panderichthys has
reduced a sixth toe.


59
0:5:56,86 --> 0:6:1,61
Looking at the Tapeats footprints, it
appears it also has a reduced fifth toe


60
0:6:1,61 --> 0:6:7,2
impression.  So let's count'em - 1,2,3,4,5
toes!


61
0:6:7,2 --> 0:6:15,3
The Scottish researchers mentioned:


62
0:6:15,3 --> 0:6:21,6
Really?  Could it be that the collection
failure was caused by the preconceptions


63
0:6:21,6 --> 0:6:28,34
and assumptions of evolution, which has
hindered proper research? Because


64
0:6:28,34 --> 0:6:33,75
predictions based on the evolution myth
would say you will find NO tetrapods in


65
0:6:33,75 --> 0:6:39,37
"older" rock formations.  Indeed it is a
collection failure, and I lay the blame at


66
0:6:39,37 --> 0:6:45,57
the feet of the evolution myth.  We have
still yet another example of how evolution


67
0:6:45,57 --> 0:6:49,97
has hindered scientific research and
discovery - discoveries that falsify the


68
0:6:49,97 --> 0:6:54,28
evolution myth, and affirm that creatures
like the tetrapods have been around since


69
0:6:54,28 --> 0:7:0,74
the beginning of Creation - just like the
Bible says. Gee, I wonder what else the


70
0:7:0,74 --> 0:7:3,4
Bible is right about?


71
0:7:3,4 --> 0:7:8,57
Hot off the presses - your ancient
ancestor was a worm!  Morris and Caron,


72
0:7:8,57 --> 0:7:12,33
publishing in Biological Reviews of the
Cambridge Philosophical Society,


73
0:7:12,33 --> 0:7:16,26
described more detail about a famous
worm from the Burgess shale of British


74
0:7:16,26 --> 0:7:21,6
Columbia, Canada.  This worm like
creature is called Pikaia, and a few years


75
0:7:21,6 --> 0:7:25,24
back, I participated in a research trip to
the Burgess Shale with Harry Nibourg,


76
0:7:25,24 --> 0:7:28,5
owner of the Big Valley Creation Science
Museum, Vance Nelson, owner of


77
0:7:28,5 --> 0:7:32,44
Canada's largest traveling creation
museum with Creation Truth ministries,


78
0:7:32,44 --> 0:7:40,33
and Yours truly.  It's been touted for years
that Pikaia is our ancient ancestor


79
0:7:40,33 --> 0:7:46,29
because it has a notochord - a soft,
flexible, tube-like spine.  Morris and Caron


80
0:7:46,29 --> 0:7:50,86
made some more interesting discoveries
upon examining multiple fossils under an


81
0:7:50,86 --> 0:8:3,82
electron microscope.  In the Royal Ontario
Museum press release, Caron said:


82
0:8:3,82 --> 0:8:6,37
You and I of course, are chordates.


83
0:8:6,37 --> 0:8:30,69
Morris and Caron held nothing back in
their press release:


84
0:8:30,69 --> 0:8:35,7
It was very interesting that while at the
Burgess Shale, Vance Nelson noted that


85
0:8:35,7 --> 0:8:42,62
Pikaia held a suspicious resemblance to
the modern sea lancelet.  In fact, some


86
0:8:42,62 --> 0:8:46,8
evolutionists have noticed the stark
similarity too - but the evolutionists


87
0:8:46,8 --> 0:8:51,65
pointed to minor differences such as the
lack of antennae on Pikaia.  However, a


88
0:8:51,65 --> 0:8:58,48
study by Purnell, et al, in a January 2010
Nature article, actually examined the


89
0:8:58,48 --> 0:9:3,61
decay of dead sea lancelets, and
discovered to their shock that the decay


90
0:9:3,61 --> 0:9:9,91
of organisms can give a false story of
EVOLUTION.  Their point was that it was


91
0:9:9,91 --> 0:9:13,83
assumed decay would take place at
random, and their research showed decay


92
0:9:13,83 --> 0:9:18,63
was NOT random. In fact, it turns out that
the very characters of organisms that are


93
0:9:18,63 --> 0:9:22,83
used by evolutionary scientists to
determine the organisms' placement on


94
0:9:22,83 --> 0:9:29,1
the evolutionary tree were the FIRST
characteristics to rot away!  So in the case


95
0:9:29,1 --> 0:9:32,53
of the sea lancelet, while some
evolutionists have contended that the


96
0:9:32,53 --> 0:9:36,58
lack of antennae in Pikaia means it must
be a different organism than the sea


97
0:9:36,58 --> 0:9:41,96
lancelet - look for yourself: The antennae
was one of the first things to rot away on


98
0:9:41,96 --> 0:9:46,98
a dead sea lancelet.  Thus, Pikaia is
probably just a slightly decayed sea


99
0:9:46,98 --> 0:9:50,37
lancelet, dead only a few days.


100
0:9:50,37 --> 0:9:55,14
So rather than proof that we (and all the
other organisms with backbones) evolved


101
0:9:55,14 --> 0:9:58,62
from a worm, this appears to be more
evidence that even organisms from the


102
0:9:58,62 --> 0:10:2,92
Burgess Shale - allegedly some of the
oldest fossils in the world, have


103
0:10:2,92 --> 0:10:8,82
reproduced faithfully after their kind since
the beginning of time - exactly what the


104
0:10:8,82 --> 0:10:13,23
Bible says, and contrary to what
Evolution would predict.  Gee, I wonder


105
0:10:13,23 --> 0:10:15,81
what else the Bible is right about?


106
0:10:15,81 --> 0:10:20,95
In another case of flagrant, open bigotry
in academia, Springer-Verlag, publisher of


107
0:10:20,95 --> 0:10:24,18
many scientific journals and books, had
scheduled to publish a book entitled


108
0:10:24,18 --> 0:10:28,42
"Biological Information: New
Perspectives," which was co-edited by Dr.


109
0:10:28,42 --> 0:10:35,72
Jonathan Sanford, co-inventor of the
gene gun and a young earth creationist.


110
0:10:35,72 --> 0:10:39,38
The Panda's thumb website pointed out
this book and Sanford's "Intelligent


111
0:10:39,38 --> 0:10:44,67
design" leanings, and suddenly the book
was yanked from publication.  The book


112
0:10:44,67 --> 0:10:49,4
had already been peer reviewed -twice!
But upon finding out that one of the book


113
0:10:49,4 --> 0:10:53,54
editors was an intelligent design
advocate, Springer pulled the book for


114
0:10:53,54 --> 0:10:58,26
additional peer-review, with
Merkel-Sobotta stated that Springer was


115
0:10:58,26 --> 0:11:2,2
unaware of the editors’ roles in the
intelligent design movement, and Springer


116
0:11:2,2 --> 0:11:6,82
does not “endorse intelligent design as a
legitimate area of scientific research.”


117
0:11:6,82 --> 0:11:12,58
Notice there was not a single thing found
wrong with the book, scientifically


118
0:11:12,58 --> 0:11:19,3
speaking. It had already passed peer
review.  This is nothing less than open,


119
0:11:19,3 --> 0:11:24,1
flagrant bigotry.  Even in the comments of
my videos here, anti-creationists ridicule


120
0:11:24,1 --> 0:11:28,3
creationists as never doing any original
research - which is patently false and


121
0:11:28,3 --> 0:11:31,67
incredibly ignorant, seeing as how many
creationists have published in secular


122
0:11:31,67 --> 0:11:35,48
literature and there are four
peer-reviewed scientific journals


123
0:11:35,48 --> 0:11:39,64
published by creationary organizations
around the world.  Secular academia has


124
0:11:39,64 --> 0:11:44,4
even openly admitted, in print, that it will
not publish creationary material -


125
0:11:44,4 --> 0:11:50,74
regardless of its scientific validity or
merit.  Therefore the claim that


126
0:11:50,74 --> 0:11:53,62
creationists don't publish in peer
reviewed journals is not just incredibly


127
0:11:53,62 --> 0:11:58,91
ignorant and untrue, it has nothing to do
with whether or not the creationists are


128
0:11:58,91 --> 0:12:2,95
right, or whether or not what they are
saying is scientific.


129
0:12:2,95 --> 0:12:7,22
In fact the evolution news website had a
couple of fascinating, well written articles


130
0:12:7,22 --> 0:12:11,2
on the bogus criticism of lack of peer
review:


131
0:12:11,2 --> 0:12:16,6
It isn't peer review anymore, it's peer
pressure.  And peer review is just another


132
0:12:16,6 --> 0:12:21,85
avenue for the flagrant bigotry that goes
on in academia toward anyone who dares


133
0:12:21,85 --> 0:12:26,75
question Darwin.  Well guess what folks,
I'm here to Question Darwin, and you can


134
0:12:26,75 --> 0:12:31,39
see some of many scientific reasons why I
doubt Darwin.  And if Darwin was wrong


135
0:12:31,39 --> 0:12:35,16
about evolution, I wonder what else he
was wrong about?


136
0:12:35,16 --> 0:12:39,82
[Scary, dramatic music]


137
0:12:39,82 --> 0:12:41,94
Wahoo! mail for me?

WOW - last weeks show was catapulted
into the #1 most discussed video in


143
0:13:7,7 --> 0:13:10,93
Science and Technology again, there was
no possible way for me to go through all


144
0:13:10,93 --> 0:13:14,74
the comments. Sadly, the anti-creationists
once again lowered the bar with their


145
0:13:14,74 --> 0:13:20,58
comments that had IQ factors containing
very large, negative integers.


146
0:13:20,58 --> 0:13:24,55
LaWilson was spouting off about
polystrate trees being in-situ, when I


147
0:13:24,55 --> 0:13:28,78
clearly refuted that idea, even showing
photographs so that YOU, the viewers,


148
0:13:28,78 --> 0:13:33,3
could see for yourself that the roots that
are there, have been stripped of their


149
0:13:33,3 --> 0:13:37,47
rootlets, and that some were
upside-down. They were not in-situ.


150
0:13:37,47 --> 0:13:41,74
Wilson also went off on some tangent
about the Alberta beds being laid down on


151
0:13:41,74 --> 0:13:46,18
an ocean floor - which I never said.  In
fact, it would appear that giant plants the


152
0:13:46,18 --> 0:13:50,7
size of TREES would not be buried on the
ocean floor, along with dinosaurs


153
0:13:50,7 --> 0:13:54,75
apparently swimming to the ocean floor
so they can walk around and leave


154
0:13:54,75 --> 0:14:0,64
footprints!  Wow wilson - Really? Where
did you get this idea?  You didn't get it


155
0:14:0,64 --> 0:14:2,33
from me.


156
0:14:2,33 --> 0:14:38,75
Fusion840 also replied to one of
Lawilson's ridiculous assertions with:


157
0:14:38,75 --> 0:14:44,23
Yes - in fact, in last week's show I even
cited the ages assigned to coal formation.


158
0:14:44,23 --> 0:14:47,84
But apparently neither Lawilson, nor
anyone else who doesn't want to believe,


159
0:14:47,84 --> 0:14:51,99
listened to that part. But hey - thanks for
trying Fusion; hope you were wearing a


160
0:14:51,99 --> 0:14:55,75
helmet for all the beating your head
against the wall you did.


161
0:14:55,75 --> 0:14:59,86
As for Derek Ager's comments about
catastrophes interspersed with long


162
0:14:59,86 --> 0:15:31,1
periods of time, I thought ChrisCarlascio
did a great job dismantling that idea:


163
0:15:31,1 --> 0:15:34,58
The Science Foundation also failed
completely to see his own blindness,


164
0:15:34,58 --> 0:15:39,53
affirming by his comments that apparently
he believes the laws of nature were


165
0:15:39,53 --> 0:15:45,19
different at the beginning, and don't apply
the "first self replicating system" - an


166
0:15:45,19 --> 0:15:49,95
alleged system that has never been
demonstrated by he or anyone else.


167
0:15:49,95 --> 0:16:1,64
As BenWalburn noted:


168
0:16:1,64 --> 0:16:5,24
Indeed.  But I just wish these guys would
stop and think, see the error of your


169
0:16:5,24 --> 0:16:9,88
ways, and repent of their sins while they
can.
