1
0:0:12,391 --> 0:0:16,876
Detail the difference between how we make decisions now


2
0:0:16,876 --> 0:0:19,495
as opposed to how decisions are arrived at


3
0:0:19,495 --> 0:0:24,37
in a Resource-Based Economy - Well, the decision making system now


4
0:0:24,37 --> 0:0:28,272
is mainly based upon different industries


5
0:0:28,272 --> 0:0:30,774
which feel that they have a good product


6
0:0:30,774 --> 0:0:36,5
so they advertise and convince people to buy that product.


7
0:0:36,5 --> 0:0:40,311
Whereas in the future, in a saner system


8
0:0:40,311 --> 0:0:44,63
we would design products not to wear out and break down


9
0:0:44,63 --> 0:0:46,967
to last as long as possible


10
0:0:46,967 --> 0:0:51,54
so that the responsibility of the service sector


11
0:0:51,54 --> 0:0:54,65
would not be overloaded.


12
0:0:54,65 --> 0:0:57,53
The longer materials last


13
0:0:57,53 --> 0:1:0,87
the less burdensome to society.


14
0:1:0,87 --> 0:1:4,98
Therefore, our major concern is not profit


15
0:1:4,98 --> 0:1:8,613
it's the well-being of human beings throughout the world.


16
0:1:8,613 --> 0:1:12,1
To the degree that we neglect people


17
0:1:12,1 --> 0:1:15,971
we hurt our own future.  For example


18
0:1:15,971 --> 0:1:19,237
if we or the United States controlled


19
0:1:19,237 --> 0:1:22,282
most of the Earth's resources


20
0:1:22,282 --> 0:1:25,911
we would produce anxiety in other countries


21
0:1:25,911 --> 0:1:28,777
for fear of running out of resources:


22
0:1:28,777 --> 0:1:33,854
arable land, water, etc.  And therefore, they might invade


23
0:1:33,854 --> 0:1:39,484
this country to try to get the necessary resources for survival.


24
0:1:39,484 --> 0:1:44,715
I don't think it's wise for a nation to defend itself


25
0:1:44,715 --> 0:1:48,217
or try to make sustainability available


26
0:1:48,217 --> 0:1:50,763
only in the area that they live


27
0:1:50,763 --> 0:1:53,983
because they would produce hatred and envy


28
0:1:53,983 --> 0:1:57,642
and try to control the resources of other countries


29
0:1:57,642 --> 0:2:2,516
so that we can enslave people or put them on minimum wage


30
0:2:2,516 --> 0:2:5,191
and get whatever we want produced


31
0:2:5,191 --> 0:2:9,503
for the self-centered reason of our nation.


32
0:2:9,503 --> 0:2:12,694
And we seek national advantage


33
0:2:12,694 --> 0:2:15,991
rather than global advantage.


34
0:2:15,991 --> 0:2:19,432
As long as we seek national advantage


35
0:2:19,432 --> 0:2:23,584
it may work for a while.  It may enhance the lifestyles


36
0:2:23,584 --> 0:2:27,894
or increase the productivity of goods and services


37
0:2:27,894 --> 0:2:32,662
but that's not of long duration. This is the only thing I worry about.


38
0:2:32,662 --> 0:2:38,234
Sustainability for separate nations is OK in the short run


39
0:2:38,234 --> 0:2:42,349
but in the long run it produces negative retroaction.


40
0:2:42,349 --> 0:2:47,523
So this is how we really work if you want to know.


41
0:2:47,523 --> 0:2:50,209
The best way to understand it


42
0:2:50,209 --> 0:2:55,127
was assuming that we found a planet similar to the Earth


43
0:2:55,127 --> 0:2:59,256
with lots of resources, unspoiled waters


44
0:2:59,256 --> 0:3:1,872
non-contaminated air;


45
0:3:1,872 --> 0:3:4,806
and brought a group of people together and ask:


46
0:3:4,806 --> 0:3:8,366
"What is it that people really need?"


47
0:3:8,366 --> 0:3:12,139
And then you list all the things that people really need.


48
0:3:12,139 --> 0:3:16,84
The next question is: "Can that planet


49
0:3:16,84 --> 0:3:18,289
provide for those needs?"


50
0:3:18,289 --> 0:3:21,834
And if it cannot, you have to base your needs


51
0:3:21,834 --> 0:3:24,545
on what the planet can provide.


52
0:3:24,545 --> 0:3:27,72
If the population is too large


53
0:3:27,72 --> 0:3:32,51
the planet cannot provide for that enlarged population.


54
0:3:32,51 --> 0:3:35,416
Therefore, the size of the population


55
0:3:35,416 --> 0:3:39,582
would be built and based upon the carrying capacity


56
0:3:39,582 --> 0:3:44,149
of that regional division or the planet's capacity


57
0:3:44,149 --> 0:3:48,34
to produce sustainable materials.


58
0:3:48,34 --> 0:3:50,349
Therefore, we cannot invite


59
0:3:50,349 --> 0:3:53,49
billions of people to live on the new planet


60
0:3:53,49 --> 0:3:55,997
if the planet cannot sustain them.


61
0:3:55,997 --> 0:4:0,72
So when I say "Decisions have to be arrived at"


62
0:4:0,72 --> 0:4:4,64
first you have to study the carrying capacity of a planet


63
0:4:4,64 --> 0:4:8,944
what it's capable of supporting.  Then you design your cities


64
0:4:8,944 --> 0:4:12,989
and population densities so that they correspond


65
0:4:12,989 --> 0:4:16,92
to the carrying capacity of the environment.


66
0:4:16,92 --> 0:4:20,343
That's what I mean when I say "People do not make decisions


67
0:4:20,343 --> 0:4:24,105
they arrive at them." And how do you decide


68
0:4:24,105 --> 0:4:27,189
how much oxygen to carry on a submarine?


69
0:4:27,189 --> 0:4:30,205
Well, that depends on the amount of people in a submarine


70
0:4:30,205 --> 0:4:35,642
and how long you wish to be submerged. That determines that.


71
0:4:35,642 --> 0:4:38,967
How do you know how much water to carry on the submarine?


72
0:4:38,967 --> 0:4:41,226
How do you know how much food to carry?


73
0:4:41,226 --> 0:4:43,566
How do you know how much electrical power?


74
0:4:43,566 --> 0:4:47,3
It depends on the performance you want of that submarine.


75
0:4:47,3 --> 0:4:50,826
Then you put in the proper electrical power


76
0:4:50,826 --> 0:4:53,603
for operating the submarine.


77
0:4:53,603 --> 0:4:57,479
You have to put in enough food and refrigeration equipment


78
0:4:57,479 --> 0:5:1,33
to feed the crew. If you don't provide for that


79
0:5:1,33 --> 0:5:5,66
the technology may work, but the crew won't.


80
0:5:5,66 --> 0:5:10,8
You have to not make decisions, you have to arrive at them.


81
0:5:10,8 --> 0:5:13,908
-That is a small portion of a talk about arriving at decisions.


82
0:5:13,908 --> 0:5:17,68
It's by survey and Scientific Method.


83
0:5:17,68 --> 0:5:22,957
And he covers some other things in there about population, laws


84
0:5:22,957 --> 0:5:27,213
negative retroactions of separate nations and national advantage


85
0:5:27,213 --> 0:5:30,89
and so forth. All of that lecture is posted


86
0:5:30,89 --> 0:5:35,818
in audio format; and to get that link for that and other posts


87
0:5:35,818 --> 0:5:39,478
be sure to sign up for the Twitter account which is /frescotweets


88
0:5:39,478 --> 0:5:44,506
Lectures and Questions and Answers will be posted there periodically.


89
0:5:44,506 --> 0:5:47,797
If you'd like to help The Venus Project out more directly


90
0:5:47,797 --> 0:5:50,606
then have a look at the new global activism page


91
0:5:50,606 --> 0:5:52,98
which you will find on the main page


92
0:5:52,98 --> 0:5:56,29
under the 'Get Involved' drop down menu.


93
0:5:56,29 --> 0:6:0,221
And you can sign up on that, your contributions are greatly appreciated.


94
0:6:0,221 --> 0:8:0,221
Thanks.
