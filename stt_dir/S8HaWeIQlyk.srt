You're being evicted.

0:0:7,72 --> 0:0:12,665
This operation will continue,
whether you co-operate or not.


3
0:0:12,665 --> 0:0:13,68
Bring it on.


4
0:0:13,68 --> 0:0:14,72
CHEERING


5
0:0:14,72 --> 0:0:15,56
It's a good job.


6
0:0:15,56 --> 0:0:18,28
You're a police officer!


7
0:0:18,28 --> 0:0:20,8
You're so keen to move on,
I think you should.


8
0:0:20,8 --> 0:0:23,28
Maybe your better class of mates
can put you up.


9
0:0:23,28 --> 0:0:24,64
Some fucker's grassing them up.


10
0:0:24,64 --> 0:0:25,68
What have you done?


11
0:0:25,68 --> 0:0:27,774
He's spied for them,
he can spy for us.


12
0:0:27,774 --> 0:0:29,56
Frank Gallagher, double agent?!


13
0:0:29,56 --> 0:0:34,286
Fuck me. He must be desperate.


14
0:0:34,286 --> 0:0:38,36
Anyone watching, thinking we know
fuck all about knowing fuck all


15
0:0:38,36 --> 0:0:40,92
about owt, needs to
watch their back! Oooh!


16
0:0:40,92 --> 0:0:44,4
So you've had your Labour,
reclassifying skunk,


17
0:0:44,4 --> 0:0:50,7
sending prices sky-high. Literally
taking the grass from its own roots!


18
0:0:50,7 --> 0:0:52,788
And now you've got
your ConDemNation,


19
0:0:52,788 --> 0:0:56,28
Liberals noshing Tories
like altar boys picking dimps up!


20
0:0:56,28 --> 0:0:59,76
Have we had a national
fucking stroke, or what?


21
0:0:59,76 --> 0:1:4,8
Is revolution a word,
or was it never?


22
0:1:4,8 --> 0:1:7,866
Anybody watching needs to know,
we cope better than average


23
0:1:7,866 --> 0:1:9,702
with irony in Chatsworth.


24
0:1:9,702 --> 0:1:12,897
Well for fuck's sake,
we live in Manchester


25
0:1:12,897 --> 0:1:16,14
and they charge us for water?!


26
0:1:16,14 --> 0:1:21,77
I wandered lonely as a clown,
necking mushrooms rarely found.


27
0:1:21,77 --> 0:1:24,2
This green and pleasant land
in ancient times,


28
0:1:24,2 --> 0:1:26,8
yak, yak, yak, yak, yak, yak,
yak, yak, yak!


29
0:1:26,8 --> 0:1:30,8
It's not theirs any more!


30
0:1:30,8 --> 0:1:33,382
This is our England now.


31
0:1:33,382 --> 0:1:35,681

Slowly, through the nose

I want you to imagine
your breaths as arrows of light,

0:2:40,52 --> 0:2:44,44

KNOCK AT DOOR


59
0:3:18,459 --> 0:3:22,686
Knock, knock!
Still allowed in my own house!


60
0:3:22,686 --> 0:3:24,48
Haven't moved in a newer model yet,
have you?


61
0:3:24,48 --> 0:3:26,56
Someone more socially acceptable?


62
0:3:26,56 --> 0:3:28,179
Don't be soft.


63
0:3:28,179 --> 0:3:32,411
Frank Gallagher's looking for digs,
is he more your type?


64
0:3:32,411 --> 0:3:35,466
I'm OK to get some clothes,
aren't I? They are my clothes.


65
0:3:35,466 --> 0:3:43,591
Dad...


66
0:3:43,591 --> 0:4:1,24
Baby, I'm so sorry.


67
0:4:1,24 --> 0:4:7,88
I'm so sorry.


68
0:4:7,88 --> 0:4:11,48
You look like a Lennon man to me.
"Power To The People"... don't shoot!


69
0:4:11,48 --> 0:4:13,405
Fuck's sake, Marty!


70
0:4:13,405 --> 0:4:15,663
Just trying to make a living! Yoko!


71
0:4:15,663 --> 0:4:18,278
It'll cheer them up at the
shelter. Nowhere to live,


72
0:4:18,278 --> 0:4:21,36
but at least they've got some
decent knocked-off tunes!


73
0:4:21,36 --> 0:4:22,4
Best of luck, mate.


74
0:4:22,4 --> 0:4:26,9
Keep positive. It might be
the best thing that ever happened.


75
0:4:26,9 --> 0:4:27,354
Where you heading to?


76
0:4:27,354 --> 0:4:30,772
Runcorn.

Snoopy Dog... ear worm!

Only dicks pay for music nowadays.
It's not Victorian times!


79
0:4:39,84 --> 0:4:41,28
Bad day at the office?


80
0:4:41,28 --> 0:4:42,504
Fucking recession.


81
0:4:42,504 --> 0:4:44,944
No-one's got disposable income.
Disgraceful.


82
0:4:44,944 --> 0:4:46,32
What you up to?


83
0:4:46,32 --> 0:4:47,16
Not much. Why?


84
0:4:47,16 --> 0:4:49,889
Going cruising with Madam.


85
0:4:49,889 --> 0:4:58,84
Fuck it.


86
0:4:58,84 --> 0:5:1,2
Late start this morning.


87
0:5:1,2 --> 0:5:4,36
They can afford it.
They're winning.


88
0:5:4,36 --> 0:5:6,311
They've won.


89
0:5:6,311 --> 0:5:10,4
It's not over yet, Karen.
It's all about hearts and minds.


90
0:5:10,4 --> 0:5:14,42
Thought it was about houses?


91
0:5:14,42 --> 0:5:16,122
Well, yeah.


92
0:5:16,122 --> 0:5:26,764
Thank you, ladies.
See you next session.


93
0:5:26,764 --> 0:5:29,242
Partner couldn't make it again?


94
0:5:29,242 --> 0:5:32,6
Really bad weather up in Aberdeen.
Force nine.


95
0:5:32,6 --> 0:5:36,52
Couldn't get off the rig.
I'll make sure he's up to speed.


96
0:5:36,52 --> 0:5:41,84
Fingers crossed he makes it for
the birth. Has he booked time off?


97
0:5:41,84 --> 0:5:45,1
Not sure. Let me look.


98
0:5:45,1 --> 0:5:51,56
Ah, here it is, filed under
"Mind Your Own Fucking Business".


99
0:5:51,56 --> 0:5:59,65
You're clouding me chakra, man.


100
0:5:59,65 --> 0:6:1,489
It's like The Sopranos, this!


101
0:6:1,489 --> 0:6:7,101
Hanging outside the club, drinking,
talking, cruising the bitches.


102
0:6:7,101 --> 0:6:10,831
What, with our changing bags,
and nappies, extra rice cakes,


103
0:6:10,831 --> 0:6:17,136
in case she gets cranky?
Yeah, dead like The Sopranos(!)


104
0:6:17,136 --> 0:6:19,68
Your future
flashing before your eyes?


105
0:6:19,68 --> 0:6:23,8
Eh? Look, what happened,
it wasn't your fault.


106
0:6:23,8 --> 0:6:27,8
It fucking was! Totally stole
Kelly off Shane like that.


107
0:6:27,8 --> 0:6:29,84
Bullshit, man,
it goes against the code.


108
0:6:29,84 --> 0:6:34,211
I'm talking about his wife and kids
frying in a fire in Spain, you twat!


109
0:6:34,211 --> 0:6:41,155
Ah! And there is no code.
She's more Mafioso than you!


110
0:6:41,155 --> 0:6:45,64
Fucking gangster, mate!
Pow, pow, pow, pow!


111
0:6:45,64 --> 0:6:48,41
BABY CRIES


112
0:6:48,41 --> 0:6:50,68
Coodgy coodgy!


113
0:6:50,68 --> 0:6:52,84
I've got a flat screen there...


114
0:6:52,84 --> 0:6:54,56
You'll be a good dad, you.


115
0:6:54,56 --> 0:6:55,6
I won't!


116
0:6:55,6 --> 0:6:57,12
Don't listen to that prick!


117
0:6:57,12 --> 0:7:1,72
If it doesn't involve acne or MILFs,
he's got no experience.


118
0:7:1,72 --> 0:7:3,48
I'm a fucking jinx, all right?


119
0:7:3,48 --> 0:7:6,8
Everything I care about,
everyone I love, get damaged.


120
0:7:6,8 --> 0:7:8,668
There's no such thing as jinxed.


121
0:7:8,668 --> 0:7:12,759
Who's been in my life long-term?
Cum-Bucket!


122
0:7:12,759 --> 0:7:14,4
Look, £10, take it or leave it.


123
0:7:14,4 --> 0:7:15,98
Fucking thief!


124
0:7:15,98 --> 0:7:20,4
Oi!


125
0:7:20,4 --> 0:7:22,32
Guy's going off his nut
cos I won't give him £50


126
0:7:22,32 --> 0:7:24,32
for a two year old portable.


127
0:7:24,32 --> 0:7:27,8
Can't fucking move in there
with shit folk are selling.


128
0:7:27,8 --> 0:7:28,92
I used to think it was "prawn" shop.


129
0:7:28,92 --> 0:7:32,4
I always thought me granddad
was taking his wedding ring


130
0:7:32,4 --> 0:7:36,149
down to the "prawn" shop!


131
0:7:36,149 --> 0:7:39,4
You better have a good reason
for dragging me out of my pit.


132
0:7:39,4 --> 0:7:42,96
Oh, yeah.


133
0:7:42,96 --> 0:7:47,323
Sorry I'm late. Fucking yoga
stresses me out.


134
0:7:47,323 --> 0:7:48,643
Bob upstairs?


135
0:7:48,643 --> 0:7:50,253
Never showed.


136
0:7:50,253 --> 0:7:52,268
Bob? He hasn't missed in... ever.


137
0:7:52,268 --> 0:7:55,116
Had an accident, something to do
with a truck and a Pelican.


138
0:7:55,116 --> 0:7:59,44
Poor bugger!


139
0:7:59,44 --> 0:8:0,88
He's got no-one.


140
0:8:0,88 --> 0:8:2,151
Mmm.


141
0:8:2,151 --> 0:8:4,88
He was a gentleman, you know.
Always asked after me.


142
0:8:4,88 --> 0:8:6,28
"How are we today, Kelly?"


143
0:8:6,28 --> 0:8:8,648
And he'd actually wait
for an answer.


144
0:8:8,648 --> 0:8:11,36
Then you'd toss him off.


145
0:8:11,36 --> 0:8:12,815
I'm going to go see him.


146
0:8:12,815 --> 0:8:15,8
Hospital's no place for you
in your condition!


147
0:8:15,8 --> 0:8:16,52
You might catch something.


148
0:8:16,52 --> 0:8:17,8
Maybe it's the hormones.


149
0:8:17,8 --> 0:8:20,77
Fuck knows, I could bottle
and sell them at the minute,


150
0:8:20,77 --> 0:8:26,56
but I'm going in.


151
0:8:26,56 --> 0:8:33,44
You missed a bit.


152
0:8:33,44 --> 0:8:34,791
Bastard!


153
0:8:34,791 --> 0:8:37,56
Fucking blood,
I've just scratched myself now!


154
0:8:37,56 --> 0:8:40,72
We're not robbing cars!
We'll never shift them!


155
0:8:40,72 --> 0:8:47,84
It's not the cars we're after.
Watch and learn.


156
0:8:47,84 --> 0:8:50,16
Stop fucking hitting me!
I'm 26-years-old!


157
0:8:50,16 --> 0:8:55,33
Fucking explain yourself!


158
0:8:55,33 --> 0:8:57,92
All those fuckers that are evicting
people from the estate, yeah,


159
0:8:57,92 --> 0:9:2,56
the Gestapo, they've got to leave
their motors somewhere, don't they?


160
0:9:2,56 --> 0:9:13,88
Can't bring them to the Chatsworth,
there's thieves knocking about.


161
0:9:13,88 --> 0:9:17,8
It's not about the cars,
it's about the booty in the boot.


162
0:9:17,8 --> 0:9:20,0
Have you seen the gear
that that lot carry?


163
0:9:20,0 --> 0:9:23,32
Phones, laptops, tablets, scanners.
Got to keep it somewhere.


164
0:9:23,32 --> 0:9:25,4
So you're taking pictures of it?


165
0:9:25,4 --> 0:9:27,6
If I wanted to connect my printer
to my computer,


166
0:9:27,6 --> 0:9:30,8
how do I do it if I don't want
wires everywhere?


167
0:9:30,8 --> 0:9:37,4
You know I don't believe in
computers, don't you?


168
0:9:37,4 --> 0:9:39,88
Bluetooth!
It detects another wireless device


169
0:9:39,88 --> 0:9:42,44
and asks you if you
want to make a connection.


170
0:9:42,44 --> 0:9:45,36
To which you reply?


171
0:9:45,36 --> 0:9:49,49
You clever bastard!


172
0:9:49,49 --> 0:10:17,734
ALARM PEALS


173
0:10:17,734 --> 0:10:21,2
Mortgage or not...


174
0:10:21,2 --> 0:10:24,189
Job or no job...


175
0:10:24,189 --> 0:10:28,184
I will always be with you.


176
0:10:28,184 --> 0:10:32,868
This makes you a very lucky man,
because I am a catch.


177
0:10:32,868 --> 0:10:36,4
Say "Thank you, Avril".


178
0:10:36,4 --> 0:10:37,672
I wanted more.


179
0:10:37,672 --> 0:10:39,44
I didn't.


180
0:10:39,44 --> 0:10:42,942
The whole world is fucked up
because people want more.


181
0:10:42,942 --> 0:10:46,14
I want us, 'Tish.


182
0:10:46,14 --> 0:10:49,284
Everything else is just...


183
0:10:49,284 --> 0:10:59,24
stuff.


184
0:10:59,24 --> 0:11:3,64
There are people round here
far worse off than us.


185
0:11:3,64 --> 0:11:16,939
You can say that again.


186
0:11:16,939 --> 0:11:18,13
What are you doing?


187
0:11:18,13 --> 0:11:21,746
Evicted. We've been living
under here three days.


188
0:11:21,746 --> 0:11:44,584
Listen to your missus, mate.
She talks sense.


189
0:11:44,584 --> 0:11:51,244
Want one? Pig in a blanket? (SNORTS)


190
0:11:51,244 --> 0:11:53,4
Unacceptable!


191
0:11:53,4 --> 0:11:55,52
Oh, yeah? Didn't takeyoulong
to revert to type.


192
0:11:55,52 --> 0:11:59,96
I am still the same lad.
I am Carl fucking Gallagher,


193
0:11:59,96 --> 0:12:1,4
except now I've got a job.


194
0:12:1,4 --> 0:12:4,8
It's not a job...
it's a Faustian deal.


195
0:12:4,8 --> 0:12:6,1
You sold your soul to
Beelzebub, you fucking


196
0:12:6,1 --> 0:12:7,92
muppet, and you
don't even know it!


197
0:12:7,92 --> 0:12:11,32
Oh, yeah... what, cos of your father
or your grandfather,


198
0:12:11,32 --> 0:12:14,8
or some fucking Irish bloke
we knew 200 years ago.


199
0:12:14,8 --> 0:12:16,24
They're as much my blood
as they are yours.


200
0:12:16,24 --> 0:12:20,697
Cos you come from here.
Have some dignity, change your name.


201
0:12:20,697 --> 0:12:24,191
Fuck the past!
Katie, Stella, little Cilla...


202
0:12:24,191 --> 0:12:25,52
that's why I'm doing it,


203
0:12:25,52 --> 0:12:28,72
to make this place less of
a shit-hole for them to grow up in.


204
0:12:28,72 --> 0:12:31,36
They've sucked out your soul.


205
0:12:31,36 --> 0:12:32,647
Bollocks.


206
0:12:32,647 --> 0:12:36,153
Well, prove it, then.


207
0:12:36,153 --> 0:12:39,513
Yeah, go on.


208
0:12:39,513 --> 0:12:50,136
Yeah, thought so.


209
0:12:50,136 --> 0:12:56,8
(SLURRED) We were brought up...
to be suspicious of the police.


210
0:12:56,8 --> 0:13:0,72
The oppressive arm of the state,
charging demonstrators on horseback,


211
0:13:0,72 --> 0:13:2,837
and all that.


212
0:13:2,837 --> 0:13:6,461
They got my motor back once, after
some little Welsh prick robbed it.


213
0:13:6,461 --> 0:13:10,24
Me grandad was in Cork.
You know... Black and Tans.


214
0:13:10,24 --> 0:13:13,657
We can't have a Gallagher
in the police.


215
0:13:13,657 --> 0:13:14,88
It's a good pension.


216
0:13:14,88 --> 0:13:18,367
I mean, he's a bright lad.
Not academic bright, mind...


217
0:13:18,367 --> 0:13:21,0
he takes after his mother in that
respect but he can turn his hand to...


218
0:13:21,0 --> 0:13:24,844
And he's a looker.


219
0:13:24,844 --> 0:13:28,445
What? I always thought it looked
like he'd got his finger in a socket


220
0:13:28,445 --> 0:13:29,947
or something, you know?


221
0:13:29,947 --> 0:13:32,178
No. The teens, the
MILFS, the GILFS...


222
0:13:32,178 --> 0:13:35,469
they'd all ride him,
given half the chance.


223
0:13:35,469 --> 0:13:37,878
What the fuck is wrong with you?!


224
0:13:37,878 --> 0:13:40,986
Was in here last night,
had one too many.


225
0:13:40,986 --> 0:13:45,4
Someone fingered me in the snug.


226
0:13:45,4 --> 0:13:48,943
Well, it wasn't me.


227
0:13:48,943 --> 0:13:53,4
You can smell if you want.


228
0:13:53,4 --> 0:13:55,64
I'll need reimbursing.


229
0:13:55,64 --> 0:13:58,96
After all the business he's given you
over the years?


230
0:13:58,96 --> 0:14:1,12
True. He was a lovely customer.


231
0:14:1,12 --> 0:14:5,98
Isa lovely customer.
He's not dead yet.


232
0:14:5,98 --> 0:14:9,941
He knowsyou'rehere.


233
0:14:9,941 --> 0:14:13,96
Every time I saw him lately, I kept
complaining about my feet killing me.


234
0:14:13,96 --> 0:14:15,16
Used to give me a foot massage.


235
0:14:15,16 --> 0:14:17,2
Had a thing about feet, didn't he?


236
0:14:17,2 --> 0:14:21,84
He had a briefcase
full of all kinds of books on feet.


237
0:14:21,84 --> 0:14:23,28
He's a chiropodist.


238
0:14:23,28 --> 0:14:25,8
Wouldn't put it past him.


239
0:14:25,8 --> 0:14:54,76
Back to work, soon as.
Profit in that bump.


240
0:14:54,76 --> 0:15:14,96
For old time's sake, eh, pal?


241
0:15:14,96 --> 0:15:16,68
Do I look like a man
with 100 quid to spare?


242
0:15:16,68 --> 0:15:20,32
It's quality gear, that...
shifted the other two already.


243
0:15:20,32 --> 0:15:22,321
You could ask Jonesy.
Oh no, he won't be able to


244
0:15:22,321 --> 0:15:25,974
take it, on account he's
got no house to live in.


245
0:15:25,974 --> 0:15:31,583
How much?


246
0:15:31,583 --> 0:15:35,278
That's all I've got.


247
0:15:35,278 --> 0:15:37,797
How do you sleep at night?


248
0:15:37,797 --> 0:15:45,136
(WHISTLES)


249
0:15:45,136 --> 0:15:48,765
Right, I don't care who did it.
I even admire your cheek a little,


250
0:15:48,765 --> 0:15:52,799
but... I want my computer back.


251
0:15:52,799 --> 0:15:55,64
It's not a work computer,
it's my personal property,


252
0:15:55,64 --> 0:15:58,328
material of sentimental value.


253
0:15:58,328 --> 0:16:1,313
Pictures of my children,
Christmas, birthdays, holidays.


254
0:16:1,313 --> 0:16:6,4
Things I can't replicate or replace.
And I stupidly have no back-up.


255
0:16:6,4 --> 0:16:8,629
I'm sorry you've
lost your mementos.


256
0:16:8,629 --> 0:16:12,336
Thanks to you, these people
have lost their homes.


257
0:16:12,336 --> 0:16:14,518
They've still got photographs.


258
0:16:14,518 --> 0:16:17,935
They just don't have anywhere
to put them.


259
0:16:17,935 --> 0:16:21,38
This is a step too far. Personal
items are not part of the game.


260
0:16:21,38 --> 0:16:22,779
The game?!


261
0:16:22,779 --> 0:16:25,657
Yeah, the fucking game.


262
0:16:25,657 --> 0:16:28,56
You people... think you're so clever.


263
0:16:28,56 --> 0:16:32,193
What you do
is not a victimless crime.


264
0:16:32,193 --> 0:16:34,56
You're a mad cow.


265
0:16:34,56 --> 0:16:38,19
All your cheating and scamming
and benefit fraud...


266
0:16:38,19 --> 0:16:39,982
- Good people, like me...
- And me.


267
0:16:39,982 --> 0:16:42,443
Have our lives impacted upon


268
0:16:42,443 --> 0:16:45,6
by your scavenging lives.
We bear the cost.


269
0:16:45,6 --> 0:16:50,36
No, you fucking don't. What you mean is,
the rules are rigged in your favour.


270
0:16:50,36 --> 0:16:52,48
Everything's rigged in your favour,


271
0:16:52,48 --> 0:16:57,32
and the moment one of us bite back,
you kick and scratch and scream,


272
0:16:57,32 --> 0:17:0,123
"I want mine! What about mine?!"


273
0:17:0,123 --> 0:17:1,834
That's my man.


274
0:17:1,834 --> 0:17:3,16
Look, come on, Miss...


275
0:17:3,16 --> 0:17:5,64
Fuck off, you leech!
Leave me alone.


276
0:17:5,64 --> 0:17:7,441
Upset by a couple of evictions, are you?


277
0:17:7,441 --> 0:17:8,52
Yeah.


278
0:17:8,52 --> 0:17:11,488
(IN AMERICAN ACCENT)
Getting all "Spartacus" on my ass?


279
0:17:11,488 --> 0:17:15,976
Progress is coming, like it or not.
Five years from now, maybe seven,


280
0:17:15,976 --> 0:17:20,402
this place won't even be here.
None of you will be here.


281
0:17:20,402 --> 0:17:24,901
The rest of society are not funding
the underbelly any more.


282
0:17:24,901 --> 0:17:31,337
We're not doing it. So it won't be
30 evictions, or 40, or even 100.


283
0:17:31,337 --> 0:17:36,76
Ten years from now,
this place will be wasteland!


284
0:17:36,76 --> 0:17:38,64
And that's not opinion...


285
0:17:38,64 --> 0:17:40,48
that's policy.


286
0:17:40,48 --> 0:17:57,0
(MAN) Go on, fuck off!


287
0:17:57,0 --> 0:18:0,84
If I'd wanted misery,
I could have stayed at home.


288
0:18:0,84 --> 0:18:3,32
What sort of shop
are you running here anyway?


289
0:18:3,32 --> 0:18:5,16
This place is fucked.


290
0:18:5,16 --> 0:18:8,28
It's always been fucked...
it's a vital part of its appeal.


291
0:18:8,28 --> 0:18:11,32
People don't know what the future
holds... they're upset.


292
0:18:11,32 --> 0:18:13,56
The future
is what you fucking make it!


293
0:18:13,56 --> 0:18:19,94
Come on, where's the spirit of '68?


294
0:18:19,94 --> 0:18:24,864
Oh, what the fuck?! Student riots?
Paris? Prague Spring?


295
0:18:24,864 --> 0:18:26,927
Tune in, drop out,


296
0:18:26,927 --> 0:18:29,613
shag a skank because she'll let you?


297
0:18:29,613 --> 0:18:33,542
Civil... disobedience.


298
0:18:33,542 --> 0:18:35,543
Huh? You don't have
to play by their


299
0:18:35,543 --> 0:18:37,613
fucking rules... make
some up of your own.


300
0:18:37,613 --> 0:18:39,269
Seize the fucking day.


301
0:18:39,269 --> 0:18:42,8
It's like the French,
but they blockade the motorways.


302
0:18:42,8 --> 0:18:44,92
And burn sheep. They do.


303
0:18:44,92 --> 0:18:50,263
Thank you. You have to admire
the Gauls for their gall,


304
0:18:50,263 --> 0:18:54,32
despite their cheese-eating
surrender-monkey tendencies.


305
0:18:54,32 --> 0:18:55,64
What more can we do?


306
0:18:55,64 --> 0:18:57,56
Why does it matter to you anyway?


307
0:18:57,56 --> 0:19:0,64
Because all this misery


308
0:19:0,64 --> 0:19:8,108
is ruining my fucking pint.


309
0:19:8,108 --> 0:19:12,409
I'm hanging up my crotchless
when this little bundle drops.


310
0:19:12,409 --> 0:19:19,96
Can't have your mam on the game,
can you?


311
0:19:19,96 --> 0:19:26,219
I've got to be responsible. I mean...


312
0:19:26,219 --> 0:19:30,866
If me and Marty go tits up like me
and Shane... cos these things happen...


313
0:19:30,866 --> 0:19:40,46
it'll just be me and a kid.


314
0:19:40,46 --> 0:19:42,515
I want this...


315
0:19:42,515 --> 0:19:44,76
more than I've ever wanted anything,
Bob.


316
0:19:44,76 --> 0:19:47,271
The fella, the kid, flat,


317
0:19:47,271 --> 0:19:55,379
nice little job where
I don't have to wear a gum-shield.


318
0:19:55,379 --> 0:19:59,547
I want the dream.


319
0:19:59,547 --> 0:20:1,911
Reckon him upstairs
will let me have it?


320
0:20:1,911 --> 0:20:5,876
Have what?


321
0:20:5,876 --> 0:20:8,232
Sorry. Who are you?


322
0:20:8,232 --> 0:20:16,42
His wife. Who are you?


323
0:20:16,42 --> 0:20:18,356
Ta.


324
0:20:18,356 --> 0:20:23,666
Not a typical hospital visitor,
if you don't mind me saying so.


325
0:20:23,666 --> 0:20:26,111
I'm just aware
that some folk don't have anyone.


326
0:20:26,111 --> 0:20:29,12
I mean,
I had no idea Bob were married.


327
0:20:29,12 --> 0:20:30,28
You missed his wedding ring?


328
0:20:30,28 --> 0:20:32,52
He never wore it.


329
0:20:32,52 --> 0:20:36,22
Sorry, my dad never wore
a wedding ring.


330
0:20:36,22 --> 0:20:44,515
I just don't even think to look.


331
0:20:44,515 --> 0:20:48,96
That must've been a real shock.
I'm sorry.


332
0:20:48,96 --> 0:20:52,408
The doctor said I should
prepare myself for the worst.


333
0:20:52,408 --> 0:20:56,48
The damage to his brain's extensive,
and if he did make a recovery...


334
0:20:56,48 --> 0:20:59,64
Look, you don't know what'll happen,
nor do the doctors,


335
0:20:59,64 --> 0:21:10,82
they're just giving you
a worst-case scenario.


336
0:21:10,82 --> 0:21:12,903
Have a look in "My Photos".
You know she'll


337
0:21:12,903 --> 0:21:15,24
have some homemade porn
on there, don't you?


338
0:21:15,24 --> 0:21:16,84
She's a businesswoman.


339
0:21:16,84 --> 0:21:20,558
She is filth, I can tell, mate.
"This place will be wasteland!"


340
0:21:20,558 --> 0:21:22,6
I almost come in me pants!


341
0:21:22,6 --> 0:21:24,521
Hey, we could stick up a
couple of barricades,


342
0:21:24,521 --> 0:21:26,44
block the roads, like
Derry in the old days.


343
0:21:26,44 --> 0:21:29,8
Oh, that's all we need...
rubber bullets and petrol bombs.


344
0:21:29,8 --> 0:21:32,291
Could enlist Marty Fisher,
he burns stuff.


345
0:21:32,291 --> 0:21:34,686
Oh, that's opening
a can of worms.


346
0:21:34,686 --> 0:21:37,8
He's imbalanced, he
wouldn't know when tostop.


347
0:21:37,8 --> 0:21:39,72
That's what Kelly says!


348
0:21:39,72 --> 0:21:41,4
Sorry.


349
0:21:41,4 --> 0:21:43,48
Maybe we take the fight toher.


350
0:21:43,48 --> 0:21:46,48
Why is the Chatsworth the
battleground? Take it to hergaff.


351
0:21:46,48 --> 0:21:48,72
It's nice, hergaff. She tried
to seduce me there, you know.


352
0:21:48,72 --> 0:21:50,0
(MIMI) Ha!


353
0:21:50,0 --> 0:21:52,1
She's got a meeting
tomorrow at her hotel.


354
0:21:52,1 --> 0:21:54,4
Council, Work and Pensions,
they're all coming.


355
0:21:54,4 --> 0:21:56,72
Dress the girl up as a chambermaid,
bug the room.


356
0:21:56,72 --> 0:21:58,431
I'd look brilliant
as a chambermaid.


357
0:21:58,431 --> 0:22:1,92
Good idea, Jason Bourne! Should I
get my bag of listening devices?


358
0:22:1,92 --> 0:22:5,16
I resisted, if anyone's interested.


359
0:22:5,16 --> 0:22:7,48
I think
she craves the furry chalice.


360
0:22:7,48 --> 0:22:9,549
Oh, fuck me,
I would pay to see that.


361
0:22:9,549 --> 0:22:11,16
We won't need to bug the room.


362
0:22:11,16 --> 0:22:12,24
How so?


363
0:22:12,24 --> 0:22:15,322
You'll see.


364
0:22:15,322 --> 0:22:17,443
Right, everyone, this is Jodie.


365
0:22:17,443 --> 0:22:20,2
She's got a rather unique talent.


366
0:22:20,2 --> 0:22:26,36
If you can just stand aside.


367
0:22:26,36 --> 0:22:29,792
The old one is saying, "Dress you up
like a chambermaid at my place,


368
0:22:29,792 --> 0:22:32,15
"we could charge a ton an hour.


369
0:22:32,15 --> 0:22:34,44
" The young one says, "I will
have tuition fees to pay."


370
0:22:34,44 --> 0:22:35,762
What the fuck?!


371
0:22:35,762 --> 0:22:37,84
She can read minds?!


372
0:22:37,84 --> 0:22:41,979
Lips, dickhead! She lip-reads. Jodie
is going to be our secret weapon.


373
0:22:41,979 --> 0:22:52,595
Well done.


374
0:22:52,595 --> 0:22:55,6
(LAUGHS)


375
0:22:55,6 --> 0:22:59,893
DISTANT PLAYGROUND NOISES


376
0:22:59,893 --> 0:23:4,66
# You stepped out of a cloud


377
0:23:4,66 --> 0:23:9,247
# I want to take you away


378
0:23:9,247 --> 0:23:13,421
# Away from the crowd... #


379
0:23:13,421 --> 0:23:16,12
I don't understand.


380
0:23:16,12 --> 0:23:19,632
This can't be happening.


381
0:23:19,632 --> 0:23:23,616
# Alone and apart


382
0:23:23,616 --> 0:23:27,641
# Out of a dream... #


383
0:23:27,641 --> 0:23:30,706
Breaking and entering,
damage to property.


384
0:23:30,706 --> 0:23:33,239
You said yourselves yesterday,
we make the rules.


385
0:23:33,239 --> 0:23:36,566
Every time you break them,
you're giving us more ammunition.


386
0:23:36,566 --> 0:23:38,801
You're damaging yourselves.


387
0:23:38,801 --> 0:23:40,482
That's clever.


388
0:23:40,482 --> 0:23:43,169
We'll just evict all over again,
only this time,


389
0:23:43,169 --> 0:23:46,655
the penalties will be stiffer.
Custodial.


390
0:23:46,655 --> 0:23:49,26
But no-one's back in the same house.


391
0:23:49,26 --> 0:23:51,322
What?


392
0:23:51,322 --> 0:23:53,372
No-one's returned
to the same properties.


393
0:23:53,372 --> 0:23:55,313
All have got new occupants.


394
0:23:55,313 --> 0:23:59,702
So, your info, work and pensions,
Inland Revenue, council tax.


395
0:23:59,702 --> 0:24:0,867
Immigration.


396
0:24:0,867 --> 0:24:2,321
Useless.


397
0:24:2,321 --> 0:24:6,65
You don't know who's who,
or where.


398
0:24:6,65 --> 0:24:9,76
You don't seriously think
this will stop it?


399
0:24:9,76 --> 0:24:13,612
(LAUGHS) Yeah.


400
0:24:13,612 --> 0:24:15,812
I seriously do.


401
0:24:15,812 --> 0:24:21,975
(LAUGHS)


402
0:24:21,975 --> 0:24:24,115
We're so screwed.


403
0:24:24,115 --> 0:24:27,166
They'll be back. Only next time,
they'll hit twice as hard.


404
0:24:27,166 --> 0:24:30,62
Dogs, PSCs, alarm systems


405
0:24:30,62 --> 0:24:32,203
and custody for anyone
who doesn't comply.


406
0:24:32,203 --> 0:24:34,642
I love my job.


407
0:24:34,642 --> 0:24:38,99
MOBILE PHONE RINGS


408
0:24:38,99 --> 0:24:41,842
Two, three, four


409
0:24:41,842 --> 0:24:43,801
and out. Arrows of light!


410
0:24:43,801 --> 0:24:48,209
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, ha, haaah!


411
0:24:48,209 --> 0:24:49,545
Camel toe!


412
0:24:49,545 --> 0:24:50,751
Bless you!


413
0:24:50,751 --> 0:24:52,854
What's wi' twitches?


414
0:24:52,854 --> 0:24:55,585
You know I still get it with you,
when I've got the horn.


415
0:24:55,585 --> 0:24:56,939
You've got the horn?


416
0:24:56,939 --> 0:24:59,46
Yeah.


417
0:24:59,46 --> 0:25:5,373
Fucking brilliant.
Now I've got the horn!


418
0:25:5,373 --> 0:25:11,873
Great. OK, up we get, mums.
Thank you very much.


419
0:25:11,873 --> 0:25:15,479
This is better than being
on a rig off Aberdeen, eh?


420
0:25:15,479 --> 0:25:16,796
What?


421
0:25:16,796 --> 0:25:18,64
Have you booked time off
for the birth?


422
0:25:18,64 --> 0:25:21,31
Oi! "One-Born-Every-Minute."
Back off.


423
0:25:21,31 --> 0:25:25,835
No, it's all right. How can I be
negative about this? We'll be good.


424
0:25:25,835 --> 0:25:28,577
THEY GRUNT


425
0:25:28,577 --> 0:25:31,118
You'll have to excuse us,
but you know what hormones are like.


426
0:25:31,118 --> 0:25:34,262
I really need to go ride my boy.


427
0:25:34,262 --> 0:25:37,141
Have you had any thoughts
on breast-feeding?


428
0:25:37,141 --> 0:25:38,698
Unleash the beast.


429
0:25:38,698 --> 0:25:46,754
Tit wank, nipple rash, areola!
Udders, puppies, milky mountains!


430
0:25:46,754 --> 0:25:48,218
Tell me again!


431
0:25:48,218 --> 0:25:51,83
I want our baby!
I love our baby.


432
0:25:51,83 --> 0:25:55,25
Oh, baby!


433
0:25:55,25 --> 0:25:58,95
The welfare state is over.
Housing, health, education.


434
0:25:58,95 --> 0:26:1,916
It just got bloated
and unaffordable.


435
0:26:1,916 --> 0:26:5,312
It's a direct consequence
of everyone living longer.


436
0:26:5,312 --> 0:26:9,357
Blah, blah, blah. That's what you
sound like to me, do you know that?


437
0:26:9,357 --> 0:26:11,781
We can beat them.
We're better than them.


438
0:26:11,781 --> 0:26:14,692
It's not about them and us.


439
0:26:14,692 --> 0:26:16,424
We're no fucking different.


440
0:26:16,424 --> 0:26:20,373
What, you think they don't love
their kids as much as we love ours?


441
0:26:20,373 --> 0:26:26,88
I have rejected 20 calls today, from
my estranged, alcoholic husband,


442
0:26:26,88 --> 0:26:32,282
who presently is fucking a girl
barely scraping legality.


443
0:26:32,282 --> 0:26:37,703
And yet, at some point,
at some point,


444
0:26:37,703 --> 0:26:40,528
I will let him come back...


445
0:26:40,528 --> 0:26:43,559
and rip the heart out of me again
and pay for the privilege.


446
0:26:43,559 --> 0:26:46,531
How is that better?


447
0:26:46,531 --> 0:26:50,319
My husband wets the bed.


448
0:26:50,319 --> 0:26:54,174
Look, it's about the system,
and getting it to work for YOU.


449
0:26:54,174 --> 0:26:55,811
That's all that counts.


450
0:26:55,811 --> 0:26:59,923
It's time to grow some balls,
Feeney.


451
0:26:59,923 --> 0:27:2,855
You don't sound like yourself.


452
0:27:2,855 --> 0:27:5,199
Be very clear...


453
0:27:5,199 --> 0:27:10,127
There are no lengths
I won't go to.


454
0:27:10,127 --> 0:27:12,427
What, you think I'm going to let
10 lazy bastards


455
0:27:12,427 --> 0:27:20,328
keep me from my salary?


456
0:27:20,328 --> 0:27:23,647
Well, that's all right. You're
the middle of the sandwich...


457
0:27:23,647 --> 0:27:27,36
I want one up there...


458
0:27:27,36 --> 0:27:28,88
I might have fucking known.


459
0:27:28,88 --> 0:27:31,2
I was tricked down here,
all right?


460
0:27:31,2 --> 0:27:33,4
She said she'd give me a blow...


461
0:27:33,4 --> 0:27:34,96
Only to lure him in.


462
0:27:34,96 --> 0:27:38,76
I tried the trail of bread crumbs,
but he didn't pick up on it.


463
0:27:38,76 --> 0:27:42,56
Right, that door stays locked
until you sort it out.


464
0:27:42,56 --> 0:27:47,6
Any stock he drinks, you pay for it.


465
0:27:47,6 --> 0:27:50,52
Shouldn't have to prove myself.
You're my dad.


466
0:27:50,52 --> 0:27:54,0
Hundred million sperm, and me best
swimmer turns out to be a Judas.


467
0:27:54,0 --> 0:27:57,853
What are the chances?


468
0:27:57,853 --> 0:28:0,38
When are you due?


469
0:28:0,38 --> 0:28:3,457
I'm five months gone.


470
0:28:3,457 --> 0:28:5,877
Your first?


471
0:28:5,877 --> 0:28:8,726
We only had the one. Unplanned.


472
0:28:8,726 --> 0:28:11,723
This one took me
a little bit by surprise.


473
0:28:11,723 --> 0:28:13,24
Scared?


474
0:28:13,24 --> 0:28:14,8
I'm fuckin' terrified.


475
0:28:14,8 --> 0:28:16,2
You'll be a great mum.


476
0:28:16,2 --> 0:28:18,64
Look at the kindness
you've shown me.


477
0:28:18,64 --> 0:28:22,12
Look at how you care for Bob,
someone you don't even know.


478
0:28:22,12 --> 0:28:31,904
I think you're remarkable.


479
0:28:31,904 --> 0:28:34,416
I love a man who's in touch
with his feminine side.


480
0:28:34,416 --> 0:28:36,16
Got your moisturiser
on my forehead too.


481
0:28:36,16 --> 0:28:37,746
The Christmas present,
or the good one?


482
0:28:37,746 --> 0:28:40,4
Green bottle.


483
0:28:40,4 --> 0:28:42,205
Can't read any more of this.


484
0:28:42,205 --> 0:28:45,416
It's all spreadsheets
and proposals. Going snow-blind.


485
0:28:45,416 --> 0:28:46,71
You did good.


486
0:28:46,71 --> 0:28:51,362
I won't let it go to my head.


487
0:28:51,362 --> 0:28:52,92
Have you seen this?


488
0:28:52,92 --> 0:28:56,72
Her contract is on here.
It's totally gold-plated.


489
0:28:56,72 --> 0:28:58,72
We've got to get this to Karen
and Jamie.


490
0:28:58,72 --> 0:29:0,44
Here's the interesting stuff.


491
0:29:0,44 --> 0:29:3,36
Her contract of employment.
Terms and conditions.


492
0:29:3,36 --> 0:29:6,72
150 grand? What, that's her salary?


493
0:29:6,72 --> 0:29:10,763
That's her bonus, if she manages
to permanently board up 120 houses.


494
0:29:10,763 --> 0:29:12,59
That's horrible.


495
0:29:12,59 --> 0:29:14,26
You can see why she'd be
pissed off at us.


496
0:29:14,26 --> 0:29:16,12
Is it wrong, right?


497
0:29:16,12 --> 0:29:21,56
That she gives me a full-on stiffy
every single time I see her?


498
0:29:21,56 --> 0:29:24,237
D'you mind if I ask you a question?


499
0:29:24,237 --> 0:29:26,284
How do you do it?


500
0:29:26,284 --> 0:29:30,12
I mean, the whole wife thing?


501
0:29:30,12 --> 0:29:33,21
All those years
and you're still in love.


502
0:29:33,21 --> 0:29:35,84
We haven't been in love
in a long time.


503
0:29:35,84 --> 0:29:39,24
We've been married 45 years.
People change.


504
0:29:39,24 --> 0:29:40,684
But you change together.


505
0:29:40,684 --> 0:29:43,599
The love we have now is...


506
0:29:43,599 --> 0:29:45,64
It's nothing like the love
we used to have.


507
0:29:45,64 --> 0:29:47,837
That's normal, isn't it?


508
0:29:47,837 --> 0:29:49,424
I suppose.


509
0:29:49,424 --> 0:29:52,1
Bob was never the most
physical of men.


510
0:29:52,1 --> 0:29:54,44
He never...


511
0:29:54,44 --> 0:29:56,396
He wasn't a sexual man.


512
0:29:56,396 --> 0:29:59,144
Eh?


513
0:29:59,144 --> 0:30:1,856
I know it must seem odd
to a woman of your age,


514
0:30:1,856 --> 0:30:4,595
but, I need that attention.
The satisfaction.


515
0:30:4,595 --> 0:30:10,942
So, I looked for it and I found it
with other men, other lovers.


516
0:30:10,942 --> 0:30:14,77
Truth be told,
I'm very much in love with someone.


517
0:30:14,77 --> 0:30:17,166
I was going to tell Bob,
but then this happened.


518
0:30:17,166 --> 0:30:18,6
You were leaving him?


519
0:30:18,6 --> 0:30:21,799
He's an old man. Inside
as well as out.


520
0:30:21,799 --> 0:30:24,56
Maybe you weren't trying
hard enough.


521
0:30:24,56 --> 0:30:26,207
Excuse me?


522
0:30:26,207 --> 0:30:30,96
Never had any trouble
when he were with me.


523
0:30:30,96 --> 0:30:32,88
Worked out well for you, hasn't it?


524
0:30:32,88 --> 0:30:34,88
Bit of luck, he'll pop his clogs
and you won't have to tell him.


525
0:30:34,88 --> 0:30:36,745
What do you mean, "with you"?


526
0:30:36,745 --> 0:30:41,298
I'm a prostitute, love. A hooker,
lady of the night, Irma la Douce.


527
0:30:41,298 --> 0:30:43,139
Bob was one of my regulars.


528
0:30:43,139 --> 0:30:45,346
Probably saw me when you
were at your lover's.


529
0:30:45,346 --> 0:30:48,893
You slut.


530
0:30:48,893 --> 0:30:50,4
You're no better.


531
0:30:50,4 --> 0:30:53,559
Get out!


532
0:30:53,559 --> 0:30:55,157
No, Hannah, stop it!


533
0:30:55,157 --> 0:30:59,32
Get off me!


534

going to benefit us?

567
0:33:20,512 --> 0:33:23,36
I'm off to take
a chainsaw to the woman(!)


568
0:33:23,36 --> 0:33:26,737
Very funny.


569
0:33:26,737 --> 0:33:35,33
What do you want?


570
0:33:35,33 --> 0:33:38,76
I will not be intimidated.


571
0:33:38,76 --> 0:33:41,2
I'm not trying to intimidate you.


572
0:33:41,2 --> 0:33:49,119
You're going to get chopped up and
thrown in the Manchester Ship Canal.


573
0:33:49,119 --> 0:33:52,651
I'm not so shocked.
You're not the first.


574
0:33:52,651 --> 0:33:56,888
I knew a hundred lads like you
when I was growing up.


575
0:33:56,888 --> 0:33:59,52
You don't have to be like this.


576
0:33:59,52 --> 0:34:1,881
Don't be scared.


577
0:34:1,881 --> 0:34:3,961
It's not that messy...


578
0:34:3,961 --> 0:34:7,67
once all the blood
drains from your corpse.


579
0:34:7,67 --> 0:34:9,393
The only question remaining for you,


580
0:34:9,393 --> 0:34:14,16
is do you want to pass up
this, literally,


581
0:34:14,16 --> 0:34:18,375
once-in-a-lifetime opportunity


582
0:34:18,375 --> 0:34:21,631
and deliver me a blow-job,
before it's too late?


583
0:34:21,631 --> 0:34:23,804
DNA, Shane!


584
0:34:23,804 --> 0:34:32,0
Fuck off! I was just asking.


585
0:34:32,0 --> 0:34:34,4
It's like the old days round here...


586
0:34:34,4 --> 0:34:36,84
one in the bathroom,
two in the dungeon. Grub's up!


587
0:34:36,84 --> 0:34:38,36
(FRANK) About fucking time.


588
0:34:38,36 --> 0:34:41,64
Of course, the kidnapee upstairs
is worth a few bob.


589
0:34:41,64 --> 0:34:44,64
150 grand bonus for kicking
people out their houses?


590
0:34:44,64 --> 0:34:46,24
Horrific, that.


591
0:34:46,24 --> 0:34:48,8
It's the poetry of the free market.


592
0:34:48,8 --> 0:34:49,68
Shut up.


593
0:34:49,68 --> 0:34:51,28
Insured up to the hilt, as well.


594
0:34:51,28 --> 0:34:54,92
She so much as trips over a stiletto
and she's minted for life.


595
0:34:54,92 --> 0:34:56,4
Can't lose for winning.


596
0:34:56,4 --> 0:34:57,56
See what your lot are about?


597
0:34:57,56 --> 0:34:58,64
My lot?


598
0:34:58,64 --> 0:35:1,0
These are the ranks you've joined.


599
0:35:1,0 --> 0:35:4,468
You are DIRECTLY responsible
for the death of this community.


600
0:35:4,468 --> 0:35:6,64
It's not fucking funny, it's tragic.


601
0:35:6,64 --> 0:35:8,28
You miserable arsehole.


602
0:35:8,28 --> 0:35:11,32
This community'll never die.
Look how they're fighting back.


603
0:35:11,32 --> 0:35:13,321
Kicked out their homes and
still refusing to lie


604
0:35:13,321 --> 0:35:15,406
down, no matter what that
blonde bint does to them.


605
0:35:15,406 --> 0:35:17,48
You are still spreading her gospel.


606
0:35:17,48 --> 0:35:20,76
If you clobbered her over
the head for the insurance,


607
0:35:20,76 --> 0:35:21,84
she'd be delighted.


608
0:35:21,84 --> 0:35:23,4
What fucking side are you on?


609
0:35:23,4 --> 0:35:24,76
I'm on my own side.


610
0:35:24,76 --> 0:35:26,665
Shut up, shut up, shut up.


611
0:35:26,665 --> 0:35:29,434
Shut up, yeah?
Shut up... thought forming.


612
0:35:29,434 --> 0:35:33,813
Carl, Carl, Carl, Carl, Carl, Carl.


613
0:35:33,813 --> 0:35:36,48
- Are you in there, son?
- What?


614
0:35:36,48 --> 0:35:40,48
My boy.


615
0:35:40,48 --> 0:35:44,48
That is the best idea I have ever...


616
0:35:44,48 --> 0:35:45,48
What is?


617
0:35:45,48 --> 0:35:48,4
Do her in for the insurance money.


618
0:35:48,4 --> 0:35:53,2
Let her take her black,
black soul off somewhere else.


619
0:35:53,2 --> 0:35:54,186
I never said that.


620
0:35:54,186 --> 0:35:59,544
Yes, you fucking did
and I have never been prouder.


621
0:35:59,544 --> 0:36:5,48
Under those layers
and layers of piggery,


622
0:36:5,48 --> 0:36:15,0
a Gallagher heart still beats.


623
0:36:15,0 --> 0:36:17,68
No. Under no circumstances.


624
0:36:17,68 --> 0:36:20,24
You're covered by
a gold-plated insurance scheme


625
0:36:20,24 --> 0:36:22,8
while on Agency business.


626
0:36:22,8 --> 0:36:24,12
Absolutely not.


627
0:36:24,12 --> 0:36:26,12
You'd get a six figure pay out.


628
0:36:26,12 --> 0:36:27,859
That doesn't make it
any more palatable.


629
0:36:27,859 --> 0:36:31,419
It's the "injured" bit
that leaves me cold.


630
0:36:31,419 --> 0:36:35,92
You will NOT empty this place.
People won't just lie down.


631
0:36:35,92 --> 0:36:39,465
We can arrange for you to be hurt.
In a controlled manner.


632
0:36:39,465 --> 0:36:42,88
And in return, you erase
all databases, spreadsheets,


633
0:36:42,88 --> 0:36:45,494
original copies...
mainframe and backup,


634
0:36:45,494 --> 0:36:48,62
on every person on
the Chatsworth Estate.


635
0:36:48,62 --> 0:36:50,1
You're not asking for much, are you?


636
0:36:50,1 --> 0:36:51,987
Can you do it?


637
0:36:51,987 --> 0:36:53,698
Yeah, it only takes a password.


638
0:36:53,698 --> 0:36:57,87
I have remote access to all
the systems, I can delete them.


639
0:36:57,87 --> 0:37:0,113
Permanently? Including backup?


640
0:37:0,113 --> 0:37:3,261
Permanently and irrevocably...
if I have a mind to.


641
0:37:3,261 --> 0:37:5,854
Which I don't.


642
0:37:5,854 --> 0:37:8,191
Why are you so nasty?


643
0:37:8,191 --> 0:37:11,72
I'm not nasty, I'm focused.


644
0:37:11,72 --> 0:37:14,0
I think a woman needs to be.


645
0:37:14,0 --> 0:37:16,968
Excuse me.


646
0:37:16,968 --> 0:37:20,972
I have to visit
the little boy's room.


647
0:37:20,972 --> 0:37:22,784
How old are you?


648
0:37:22,784 --> 0:37:24,948
40? 45?


649
0:37:24,948 --> 0:37:28,974
Fuck off. Scrape the cement away,
that one'll never see 50 again.


650
0:37:28,974 --> 0:37:30,575
Your point being?


651
0:37:30,575 --> 0:37:33,827
Is this how you want
to spend the next two years?


652
0:37:33,827 --> 0:37:36,964
Are you really that committed
on getting one over on us?


653
0:37:36,964 --> 0:37:40,84
But she's not committed,
though, are you?


654
0:37:40,84 --> 0:37:44,154
It's not political.
It's not an agenda.


655
0:37:44,154 --> 0:37:52,696
It's about being strong,
being in control.


656
0:37:52,696 --> 0:37:54,967
I bet your husband's a right prick.


657
0:37:54,967 --> 0:37:57,638
(LAUGHS)


658
0:37:57,638 --> 0:37:59,466
You don't hide it well.


659
0:37:59,466 --> 0:38:15,112
I believe in what I'm doing.
It's necessary.


660
0:38:15,112 --> 0:38:20,318
But I'm so sick of
all this unpleasantness.


661
0:38:20,318 --> 0:38:24,285
I am. I'm so tired.


662
0:38:24,285 --> 0:38:30,2
I'm exhausted.


663
0:38:30,2 --> 0:38:35,22
What safeguards would I have?


664
0:38:35,22 --> 0:38:43,128
Trust us, violence is our thing.


665
0:38:43,128 --> 0:38:45,353
Do you need me to get you a nurse?


666
0:38:45,353 --> 0:38:48,36
You should be due some pain killers.


667
0:38:48,36 --> 0:38:50,183
How's Bob?


668
0:38:50,183 --> 0:38:51,502
Same.


669
0:38:51,502 --> 0:38:55,55
I'm sorry. The baby, you...
I told you I was jinxed.


670
0:38:55,55 --> 0:38:56,32
I don't need this.


671
0:38:56,32 --> 0:38:58,68
Everything I touch turns to shit.
Everything.


672
0:38:58,68 --> 0:39:10,32
I don't have the strength
for this to be about you, Marty.


673
0:39:10,32 --> 0:39:12,81
Can't leave Bob on his own.


674
0:39:12,81 --> 0:39:14,949
Will you forget about fucking Bob?


675
0:39:14,949 --> 0:39:18,206
He has no-one...


676
0:39:18,206 --> 0:39:21,32
and he could be stuck
inside that injury for years.


677
0:39:21,32 --> 0:39:23,88
I'll take care of Bob... worry not.


678
0:39:23,88 --> 0:39:31,148
You take care of her
or you've got me to answer to.


679
0:39:31,148 --> 0:39:37,769
I'm sorry.


680
0:39:37,769 --> 0:39:39,56
KNOCKING ON DOOR


681
0:39:39,56 --> 0:39:41,386
Private meeting... fuck off!


682
0:39:41,386 --> 0:39:45,416
Take one each and
don't let anyone else see it.


683
0:39:45,416 --> 0:39:47,846
Everyone's volunteered,
but only one of us can do the deed.


684
0:39:47,846 --> 0:39:49,409
"There can be only one."


685
0:39:49,409 --> 0:39:50,44
Behave.


686
0:39:50,44 --> 0:39:53,64
If anyone gets fingered,
they'll be looking at a long stretch.


687
0:39:53,64 --> 0:39:55,88
Assault on someone
on government business.


688
0:39:55,88 --> 0:39:59,24
What the fuck?
Am I holding the coats, or what?


689
0:39:59,24 --> 0:40:2,96
She knows you. We don't want her
to be able to ID the attackers.


690
0:40:2,96 --> 0:40:4,72
You're hardly inconspicuous.


691
0:40:4,72 --> 0:40:6,32
GASPING


692
0:40:6,32 --> 0:40:10,0
Firstly, Enoch, we're not
the only blacks in the village.


693
0:40:10,0 --> 0:40:11,68
Secondly...


694
0:40:11,68 --> 0:40:13,16
(GROANS)


695
0:40:13,16 --> 0:40:16,0
Besides, Dad,
you couldn't beat eggs.


696
0:40:16,0 --> 0:40:17,76
It's the principle.


697
0:40:17,76 --> 0:40:19,92
Right, whoever's got it,
wear the mask...


698
0:40:19,92 --> 0:40:21,4
"Wear the mask".


699
0:40:21,4 --> 0:40:23,44
Right.


700
0:40:23,44 --> 0:40:27,4
And exercise some restraint.
Beat her enough to get compensation,


701
0:40:27,4 --> 0:40:28,6
not enough to piss her off.


702
0:40:28,6 --> 0:40:30,96
Crack her on the nose.


703
0:40:30,96 --> 0:40:33,16
What about, er, knee-caps?
They're always good, aren't they?


704
0:40:33,16 --> 0:40:35,72
Definitely no knee-caps. Too far.


705
0:40:35,72 --> 0:40:37,68
Yeah, she wouldn't walk for months.


706
0:40:37,68 --> 0:40:39,28
I've heard nothing.


707
0:40:39,28 --> 0:41:3,532
A targeted beating.
Just enough to fool a loss adjustor.


708
0:41:3,532 --> 0:41:7,83
There you go, love.


709
0:41:7,83 --> 0:41:11,92
Good boy.


710
0:41:11,92 --> 0:41:24,6
You're DNR now, love.
You've already gone, haven't you?


711
0:41:24,6 --> 0:41:28,56
Good night, sweetheart. God bless.


712
0:41:28,56 --> 0:41:30,84
BEEPING


713
0:41:30,84 --> 0:41:35,16
# You


714
0:41:35,16 --> 0:41:41,311
# Stepped out of a dream


715
0:41:41,311 --> 0:41:46,64
# You are too wonderful


716
0:41:46,64 --> 0:41:52,52
# To be what you seem


717
0:41:52,52 --> 0:41:58,248
# Could there be eyes like yours... #


718
0:41:58,248 --> 0:42:0,84
(SCREAMS)


719
0:42:0,84 --> 0:42:2,56
(KAREN) Forgot your flowers.


720
0:42:2,56 --> 0:42:4,28
Ate your grapes.


721
0:42:4,28 --> 0:42:8,24
Can you can move your hand?


722
0:42:8,24 --> 0:42:12,982
Yeah, that's the correct account.


723
0:42:12,982 --> 0:42:27,63
I just wanted to check how much we
have outstanding on our Council Tax?


724
0:42:27,63 --> 0:42:28,717
Done.


725
0:42:28,717 --> 0:42:30,405
You better not be winding us up,


726
0:42:30,405 --> 0:42:36,572
cos there is still time
to plant you under a fly-over.


727
0:42:36,572 --> 0:42:40,99
What, they've all crashed?


728
0:42:40,99 --> 0:42:44,92
And when will they be
back up and running?


729
0:42:44,92 --> 0:42:47,48
Everyone's system
went down at the same time.


730
0:42:47,48 --> 0:42:50,72
Congratulations...
you're a wealthy woman.


731
0:42:50,72 --> 0:43:11,251
Nice doing business with you.


732
0:43:11,251 --> 0:43:14,98
(ALL) While I continue
to be a police officer,


733
0:43:14,98 --> 0:43:17,221
I will, to the best of
my skill and knowledge,


734
0:43:17,221 --> 0:43:22,32
discharge all the duties thereof,
faithfully according to law.


735
0:43:22,32 --> 0:43:24,6
Can you eat that, after?


736
0:43:24,6 --> 0:43:26,56
The Fondant Fancy?


737
0:43:26,56 --> 0:43:44,72
APPLAUSE


738
0:43:44,72 --> 0:43:49,28
# He's gonna step on you again


739
0:43:49,28 --> 0:43:58,84
# He's gonna step on


740
0:43:58,84 --> 0:44:3,84
# Hey, rainmaker, come away
from that man you know


741
0:44:3,84 --> 0:44:8,76
# He's gonna take away
your promised land... #


742
0:44:8,76 --> 0:44:11,96
Let's get you a drink, eh?


743
0:44:11,96 --> 0:44:13,32
Fuck off.


744
0:44:13,32 --> 0:44:16,28
Give the lady a beer before
I stick my toe up your arse,


745
0:44:16,28 --> 0:44:17,68
and not in a nice way.


746
0:44:17,68 --> 0:44:26,16
She's our guest. Treat her like one.
Mingle, Mrs Feeney.


747
0:44:26,16 --> 0:44:29,6
# Gonna stamp out your fire
He can change your desire... #


748
0:44:29,6 --> 0:44:30,92
No, can't make it out.


749
0:44:30,92 --> 0:44:34,626
They're Polish... cheaper.


750
0:44:34,626 --> 0:44:36,979
Cos that's what
you're looking for in a condom...


751
0:44:36,979 --> 0:44:39,755
cheapness. Forget condoms, son.


752
0:44:39,755 --> 0:44:48,32
Bareback is best, first and always.


753
0:44:48,32 --> 0:45:11,293
Sorry for your loss.


754
0:45:11,293 --> 0:45:13,57
Are you a fucking animal?


755
0:45:13,57 --> 0:45:14,24
What?


756
0:45:14,24 --> 0:45:16,53
Guy's just lost a baby.


757
0:45:16,53 --> 0:45:20,736
Fuck off!


758
0:45:20,736 --> 0:45:31,654
(MIMI) Can I have a cold one?


759
0:45:31,654 --> 0:45:34,963
Why are you all being so nice to me?


760
0:45:34,963 --> 0:45:37,24
You're losing your religion
as we speak.


761
0:45:37,24 --> 0:45:40,382
We've all been there at one point.


762
0:45:40,382 --> 0:45:45,68
You know, I never really thought
of you people as people before.


763
0:45:45,68 --> 0:45:56,277
LAUGHTER


764
0:45:56,277 --> 0:46:5,906
You're a curious one.


765
0:46:5,906 --> 0:46:11,592
You've really achieved something.
I'm proud.


766
0:46:11,592 --> 0:46:15,87
These people here, every one of them,


767
0:46:15,87 --> 0:46:20,651
has a bar tab as long
as a bride's train.


768
0:46:20,651 --> 0:46:24,22
Licence to sell alcohol... reinstated.


769
0:46:24,22 --> 0:46:29,4
But you said everybody's drinks
were on the house.


770
0:46:29,4 --> 0:46:30,84
You didn't believe that, did you?


771
0:46:30,84 --> 0:46:43,8
Hearts and minds, Karen.
Hearts and minds.


772
0:46:43,8 --> 0:46:44,4
Technique?


773
0:46:44,4 --> 0:46:45,48
Rough.


774
0:46:45,48 --> 0:46:48,115
Six out of ten.


775
0:46:48,115 --> 0:46:49,68
Stamina?


776
0:46:49,68 --> 0:46:52,36
I've flushed myself twice
just watching him.


777
0:46:52,36 --> 0:46:55,2
Why am I sitting with you two?


778
0:46:55,2 --> 0:47:1,6
Oh, I'm so confused.


779
0:47:1,6 --> 0:47:5,8
(KELLY) 'So, when it seems
you can't take any more,


780
0:47:5,8 --> 0:47:9,287
'looks like there's no way out,
no solution to your problems,


781
0:47:9,287 --> 0:47:14,478
'just remember this...
there's always tomorrow.


782
0:47:14,478 --> 0:47:17,935
'It's easy to give in, to give up.


783
0:47:17,935 --> 0:47:20,8
'It's much harder to look
for the silver lining.


784
0:47:20,8 --> 0:47:26,4
'But it's worth looking for.


785
0:47:26,4 --> 0:47:29,88
'It's really worth looking for.'


786
0:47:29,88 --> 0:47:31,52
Anything wrong with this picture?


787
0:47:31,52 --> 0:47:33,96
Jesus, babe, we're different.


788
0:47:33,96 --> 0:47:37,92
Different doesn't last.
I want an open relationship.


789
0:47:37,92 --> 0:47:39,72
Is it him? Are you doing him?


790
0:47:39,72 --> 0:47:41,24
Calm yourself, fella.


791
0:47:41,24 --> 0:47:43,16
It's the shortest mass
in Manchester.


792
0:47:43,16 --> 0:47:46,52
The funeral crashers. You're
like fucking vultures, you two.


793
0:47:46,52 --> 0:47:48,44
It's a social responsibility.


794
0:47:48,44 --> 0:47:50,16
Any more sherry,
I'll be shitting doilies.


795
0:47:50,16 --> 0:47:52,0
Would you say a few words?


796
0:47:52,0 --> 0:47:55,8
And then, of course,
there was Woodstock.


797
0:47:55,8 --> 0:47:58,64
I want you to take your stepfather
out and get him laid.


798
0:47:58,64 --> 0:48:0,799
You're shagging someone.
So, who do you want to ride?


799
0:48:0,799 --> 0:48:2,797
I want to ride your mum.
