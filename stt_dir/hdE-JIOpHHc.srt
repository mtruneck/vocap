1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:10,67



2
0:0:10,67 --> 0:0:12,29
SUROOSH ALVI: We're
in Baghdad.


3
0:0:12,29 --> 0:0:15,57
We're here to interview the only
Iraqi heavy metal band


4
0:0:15,57 --> 0:0:17,55
called Acrassicauda.


5
0:0:17,55 --> 0:0:19,61
We've been following them
for three years.


6
0:0:19,61 --> 0:0:23,31
This is risky, it's dangerous,
people would say it's really


7
0:0:23,31 --> 0:0:25,33
fucking stupid for us
to be doing this.


8
0:0:25,33 --> 0:0:28,725
But heavy metal rules.


9
0:0:28,725 --> 0:0:32,78



10
0:0:32,78 --> 0:0:34,11
MALE SPEAKER 1: Rock
stars, yeah.


11
0:0:34,11 --> 0:0:36,78



12
0:0:36,78 --> 0:0:40,56
MALE SPEAKER 2: If I didn't play
drums as hard as I can,


13
0:0:40,56 --> 0:0:44,35
I'm going to kill someone.


14
0:0:44,35 --> 0:0:47,3
MALE SPEAKER 1: These are our
fans, and most of them either


15
0:0:47,3 --> 0:0:49,3
dead or out of this country--


16
0:0:49,3 --> 0:0:50,1
they just disappeared.


17
0:0:50,1 --> 0:0:51,33
MALE SPEAKER 3: Whoa.


18
0:0:51,33 --> 0:0:53,71
MALE SPEAKER 2: We got the
troops and we got the tourists


19
0:0:53,71 --> 0:0:56,56
outside, and we are stuck
in the middle.


20
0:0:56,56 --> 0:0:58,99
SUROOSH ALVI: The first question
they asked us was


21
0:0:58,99 --> 0:1:0,51
have you guys ever used guns?


22
0:1:0,51 --> 0:1:2,75
And then they gave us these flak
jackets, and they said be


23
0:1:2,75 --> 0:1:3,95
prepared to be shot at.


24
0:1:3,95 --> 0:1:6,85
MALE SPEAKER 4: It's so amazing
that we're still


25
0:1:6,85 --> 0:1:8,1
talking and breathing.


26
0:1:8,1 --> 0:1:10,842



27
0:1:10,842 --> 0:1:13,595
MALE SPEAKER 5: This is what
life looks like here.


28
0:1:13,595 --> 0:1:16,1
[LAUGHING], Maiden rule, dude.


29
0:1:16,1 --> 0:1:18,3
SUROOSH ALVI: We're going to the
practice space right now,


30
0:1:18,3 --> 0:1:19,67
it got hit by a scud missile.


31
0:1:19,67 --> 0:1:22,4
MALE SPEAKER 2: We had a threat,
but we're going to get


32
0:1:22,4 --> 0:1:23,17
you one by one.


33
0:1:23,17 --> 0:1:24,723
MALE SPEAKER 6: If we
go, we go together.


34
0:1:24,723 --> 0:1:26,32
MALE SPEAKER 3: Yeah,
metalheads forever.


35
0:1:26,32 --> 0:1:29,218



36
0:1:29,218 --> 0:1:31,44
MALE SPEAKER 6: OK, we
talk here about a


37
0:1:31,44 --> 0:1:32,74
free country, right?


38
0:1:32,74 --> 0:1:33,99
Where's the freedom?


39
0:1:33,99 --> 0:3:33,99
