1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:8,892



2
0:0:8,892 --> 0:0:11,856
MALE SPEAKER: Now, does that
one come with the photo?


3
0:0:11,856 --> 0:0:14,94
THOM DEVITA: This one
is not for sale.


4
0:0:14,94 --> 0:0:15,344
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, OK.


5
0:0:15,344 --> 0:0:19,998



6
0:0:19,998 --> 0:0:21,26
THOM DEVITA: Isn't that
a great photo?


7
0:0:21,26 --> 0:0:22,21
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.


8
0:0:22,21 --> 0:0:24,75
THOM DEVITA: The black
and white one.


9
0:0:24,75 --> 0:0:27,51
No gloves, ink, and blood.


10
0:0:27,51 --> 0:0:30,24
MALE SPEAKER: When did you
start wearing gloves?


11
0:0:30,24 --> 0:0:33,194
THOM DEVITA: I kept thinking
I should be wearing gloves.


12
0:0:33,194 --> 0:0:38,43
And one day, a girl who was
working for Ed came up.


13
0:0:38,43 --> 0:0:40,26
And she looked in
my little room--


14
0:0:40,26 --> 0:0:42,13
I had customers outside--


15
0:0:42,13 --> 0:0:46,21
and she looks in, and she
says aloud, no gloves?


16
0:0:46,21 --> 0:0:48,71



17
0:0:48,71 --> 0:0:52,9
I sent Fred out for
a box of gloves.


18
0:0:52,9 --> 0:1:4,78
[MUSIC PLAYING]


19
0:1:4,78 --> 0:1:8,0
JOHN WYATT: People would come
into the shop with a


20
0:1:8,0 --> 0:1:9,67
preconceived notion.


21
0:1:9,67 --> 0:1:14,39
For example, a lot of the
Hispanic men wanted Jesus


22
0:1:14,39 --> 0:1:17,39
Christ or the Madonna.


23
0:1:17,39 --> 0:1:21,46
And Tom felt like tattooing
something Japanese.


24
0:1:21,46 --> 0:1:24,87
And he would invariably talk
them into, instead of Christ,


25
0:1:24,87 --> 0:1:29,85
a Japanese demon head, or
instead of Madonna, a woman


26
0:1:29,85 --> 0:1:33,16
that looked like a hooker.


27
0:1:33,16 --> 0:1:37,65
I met Thom in about '73, '74.


28
0:1:37,65 --> 0:1:43,38
And I went into this apartment
around Washington Square Park.


29
0:1:43,38 --> 0:1:47,48
Ed was tattooing a Kirin on
the back of Thom's thigh.


30
0:1:47,48 --> 0:1:48,89
And I was just blown away.


31
0:1:48,89 --> 0:1:51,21
I never saw anybody like Thom.


32
0:1:51,21 --> 0:1:55,53
Here's a man with a whole
body suit, practically.


33
0:1:55,53 --> 0:1:58,41
And I thought, I'm going to have
to photograph this guy.


34
0:1:58,41 --> 0:2:0,515
He's so interesting.


35
0:2:0,515 --> 0:2:3,24
And I said, can I have
your phone number?


36
0:2:3,24 --> 0:2:6,87
And he said, yes,
it's H-E-V-T--


37
0:2:6,87 --> 0:2:7,9
they were all letters.


38
0:2:7,9 --> 0:2:12,37
He didn't think in
terms of numbers.


39
0:2:12,37 --> 0:2:15,45
I felt that Thom was
not acting strange.


40
0:2:15,45 --> 0:2:17,73
I felt that's truly who
he was, that he


41
0:2:17,73 --> 0:2:20,48
was somewhat primitive.


42
0:2:20,48 --> 0:2:25,6
That he's lived in sort of an
isolated way and wasn't part


43
0:2:25,6 --> 0:2:27,251
of the mainstream and didn't
care about that.


44
0:2:27,251 --> 0:2:29,9



45
0:2:29,9 --> 0:2:32,65
One of the entertainment
qualities to hanging around


46
0:2:32,65 --> 0:2:35,72
the shop was you never knew
what was going to happen.


47
0:2:35,72 --> 0:2:38,59
There was a character that
showed up with a peace pipe


48
0:2:38,59 --> 0:2:41,68
claiming to be an American
Indian, although I think he


49
0:2:41,68 --> 0:2:43,97
was a Latino.


50
0:2:43,97 --> 0:2:46,47
There were just so many
different characters there


51
0:2:46,47 --> 0:2:49,71
that it was like going to a
Fellini movie every time you


52
0:2:49,71 --> 0:2:51,975
went there.


53
0:2:51,975 --> 0:2:54,4
ED HARDY: Thom had the weirdest
assortment of people


54
0:2:54,4 --> 0:2:54,785
around there.


55
0:2:54,785 --> 0:2:57,64
His crew was just very
eccentric like


56
0:2:57,64 --> 0:2:58,68
New York street life.


57
0:2:58,68 --> 0:3:1,7
It's like when you read
Burroughs in the stories when


58
0:3:1,7 --> 0:3:5,7
people like Junkie and some of
those guys are rolling lushes


59
0:3:5,7 --> 0:3:6,94
in Times Square.


60
0:3:6,94 --> 0:3:12,9
It's just a complete old school,
New York underworld.


61
0:3:12,9 --> 0:3:15,96
JOHN WYATT: It was a diversity
of customers.


62
0:3:15,96 --> 0:3:20,65
Later on he had Chinese gang
members coming to him.


63
0:3:20,65 --> 0:3:23,63
Customers would be coming in and
out all day, all the time.


64
0:3:23,63 --> 0:3:25,0
So, I was there.


65
0:3:25,0 --> 0:3:28,73
And they would usually call from
a payphone, say they were


66
0:3:28,73 --> 0:3:29,88
in the area.


67
0:3:29,88 --> 0:3:34,11
And then usually if Fred Klausen
was there, he would go


68
0:3:34,11 --> 0:3:37,31
down the three flights
to answer the door.


69
0:3:37,31 --> 0:3:40,33
Fred Klausen was a
friend of Tom's.


70
0:3:40,33 --> 0:3:43,25
And he was there almost
all of the time.


71
0:3:43,25 --> 0:3:46,9
He drew a lot of the
flash that Tom had.


72
0:3:46,9 --> 0:3:49,145
He was a pretty good artist.


73
0:3:49,145 --> 0:3:51,68
NICK BUBASH: And that allowed
Thom the time


74
0:3:51,68 --> 0:3:53,62
to just do the tattooing.


75
0:3:53,62 --> 0:3:58,32
I remember he paid Freddy $30 a
day, because he would always


76
0:3:58,32 --> 0:3:59,894
say I'm doing this
one for Freddy.


77
0:3:59,894 --> 0:4:1,762
I do one a day for Fred.


78
0:4:1,762 --> 0:4:4,99
ED HARDY: He was just like
Tom's right-hand guy and


79
0:4:4,99 --> 0:4:7,67
gopher and did a lot of
stuff for him and


80
0:4:7,67 --> 0:4:8,68
drew some of the flash.


81
0:4:8,68 --> 0:4:9,54
He was just around.


82
0:4:9,54 --> 0:4:11,857
I mean, it was like everything
in deVita's, it was just


83
0:4:11,857 --> 0:4:13,3
really amorphous.


84
0:4:13,3 --> 0:4:15,9
THOM DEVITA: They always used
to say, I was the only


85
0:4:15,9 --> 0:4:19,936
tattooer with a butler.


86
0:4:19,936 --> 0:4:21,25
That was Fred.


87
0:4:21,25 --> 0:4:23,43
NICK BUBASH: He answered
the door.


88
0:4:23,43 --> 0:4:25,7
He was very soft-spoken.


89
0:4:25,7 --> 0:4:29,922
THOM DEVITA: And Bink saw his
first tattoo on Fred, which


90
0:4:29,922 --> 0:4:31,21
was my tattooing.


91
0:4:31,21 --> 0:4:32,91
It's when he was a little kid.


92
0:4:32,91 --> 0:4:35,492
And that was the first
tattoos he ever saw.


93
0:4:35,492 --> 0:4:38,65
NICK BUBASH: Oh, because Binks
lived near where Fred lived.


94
0:4:38,65 --> 0:4:40,96
ROBERT RYAN: He grew up in the
town I grew up in, Point


95
0:4:40,96 --> 0:4:42,57
Pleasant, in New Jersey.


96
0:4:42,57 --> 0:4:44,8
I might have been 10
years old in the


97
0:4:44,8 --> 0:4:47,0
supermarket with my mother.


98
0:4:47,0 --> 0:4:49,4
And I saw this really
dynamic person.


99
0:4:49,4 --> 0:4:53,24
He had this really long beard
and tattoos all over his arms.


100
0:4:53,24 --> 0:4:56,73
So, the first tattoos I really
saw, the first heavily


101
0:4:56,73 --> 0:5:0,83
tattooed person I saw
were deVita tattoos.


102
0:5:0,83 --> 0:5:2,53
And later on, I met Fred.


103
0:5:2,53 --> 0:5:5,236
I got to see the tattoos that
blew my mind when I


104
0:5:5,236 --> 0:5:6,44
was 10 years old.


105
0:5:6,44 --> 0:5:8,19
I got to see in person.


106
0:5:8,19 --> 0:5:11,49
So cool, and so strong,
and so personal.


107
0:5:11,49 --> 0:5:15,58
NICK BUBASH: I think Binks
inherited all of Fred's stuff,


108
0:5:15,58 --> 0:5:16,19
all of his journals.


109
0:5:16,19 --> 0:5:17,8
THOM DEVITA: Oh, yeah.


110
0:5:17,8 --> 0:5:19,25
He used to write journals.


111
0:5:19,25 --> 0:5:20,585
NICK BUBASH: Freddy
kept journals, I


112
0:5:20,585 --> 0:5:21,24
guess piles of them.


113
0:5:21,24 --> 0:5:22,783
THOM DEVITA: And then he died.


114
0:5:22,783 --> 0:5:27,89
And he gave them all to
Binks before he died.


115
0:5:27,89 --> 0:5:31,2
ROBERT RYAN: Before he passed
away, he left me his whole


116
0:5:31,2 --> 0:5:32,65
collection of journals.


117
0:5:32,65 --> 0:5:36,87
So, there's actually hundreds
of them, which pretty much


118
0:5:36,87 --> 0:5:42,68
span the course of 1966
to about 1994.


119
0:5:42,68 --> 0:5:47,1
It's just cool to really get--
you know, a guy that I knew


120
0:5:47,1 --> 0:5:50,72
pretty well, to really see where
he was at when he was my


121
0:5:50,72 --> 0:5:52,7
age and younger, it's
really cool.


122
0:5:52,7 --> 0:5:57,13
And it's weird that we were kind
of these kindred spirits.


123
0:5:57,13 --> 0:5:57,84
It's strange.


124
0:5:57,84 --> 0:5:58,965
I go through here.


125
0:5:58,965 --> 0:6:2,29
A lot of these notebooks could
have been mine, reading some


126
0:6:2,29 --> 0:6:5,56
of the writings and some of the
stuff that he collected.


127
0:6:5,56 --> 0:6:8,48
Here's a good Fred
one I could read.


128
0:6:8,48 --> 0:6:12,32
"I look up to no man in
adoration as I did before.


129
0:6:12,32 --> 0:6:15,9
Now I know I am as strong or
stronger than my past Gods.


130
0:6:15,9 --> 0:6:19,55
I meet them as equals where it
makes no difference if I don't


131
0:6:19,55 --> 0:6:20,81
meet them at all.


132
0:6:20,81 --> 0:6:23,47
I have my own contentment
to keep me company.


133
0:6:23,47 --> 0:6:27,28
The world opens up in front of
me without any effort on my


134
0:6:27,28 --> 0:6:30,41
part."


135
0:6:30,41 --> 0:6:34,32
They're really, really a great
insight onto Freddy's


136
0:6:34,32 --> 0:6:38,69
personality, and also the time
that Thom and Fred were


137
0:6:38,69 --> 0:6:39,945
hanging out in New York.


138
0:6:39,945 --> 0:6:43,51
I don't think that they were
necessarily part of a scene.


139
0:6:43,51 --> 0:6:46,0
But they were kind
of the scene.


140
0:6:46,0 --> 0:6:52,29
And the whole Eastern Buddhism
thing that was kind of


141
0:6:52,29 --> 0:6:54,26
catching on in New York
City at the time, they


142
0:6:54,26 --> 0:6:56,65
were there for that.


143
0:6:56,65 --> 0:7:0,2
You talk to Thom about it, and
I don't think he was as into


144
0:7:0,2 --> 0:7:1,74
it as Freddy was.


145
0:7:1,74 --> 0:7:5,5
But I think that it was more
Thom was friends with Tyler,


146
0:7:5,5 --> 0:7:6,3
and also his neighbor.


147
0:7:6,3 --> 0:7:9,48



148
0:7:9,48 --> 0:7:14,1
Tyler was an anarchist that
had started his own church


149
0:7:14,1 --> 0:7:16,3
down in the Lower East Side.


150
0:7:16,3 --> 0:7:19,56
He would do tattoos according to
the phases of the moon and


151
0:7:19,56 --> 0:7:21,51
certain lunar holidays.


152
0:7:21,51 --> 0:7:23,65
He was definitely a
far out character.


153
0:7:23,65 --> 0:7:25,69
ED HARDY: My friend Vale did an
interview with him in one


154
0:7:25,69 --> 0:7:27,91
of those "Tattootime's."
He has this


155
0:7:27,91 --> 0:7:29,9
whole phalanstery thing.


156
0:7:29,9 --> 0:7:31,66
And it was based on a
combination of mainly


157
0:7:31,66 --> 0:7:33,73
esoteric, Tibetan-Buddhism,
[INAUDIBLE]


158
0:7:33,73 --> 0:7:35,85
stuff, and astrology.


159
0:7:35,85 --> 0:7:38,58
And he did these
insane things.


160
0:7:38,58 --> 0:7:42,13
He was a phenomenal, phenomenal
person, really just


161
0:7:42,13 --> 0:7:46,89
out there, really brilliant,
a real genius.


162
0:7:46,89 --> 0:7:48,98
NICK BUBASH: When you became
a member of the Uranian


163
0:7:48,98 --> 0:7:52,2
Phalanstery, you went
downstairs.


164
0:7:52,2 --> 0:7:55,5
Dick took your photograph
with a Polaroid.


165
0:7:55,5 --> 0:7:58,46
He wrote your name
on it backwards.


166
0:7:58,46 --> 0:8:1,6
In other words, I
was Kcin Hsabub.


167
0:8:1,6 --> 0:8:5,25
And then he tacked it on the
wall in the phalanstery, which


168
0:8:5,25 --> 0:8:7,49
was an old synagogue.


169
0:8:7,49 --> 0:8:9,79
Talk about bizarre.


170
0:8:9,79 --> 0:8:12,64
This Reverend Dick did this.


171
0:8:12,64 --> 0:8:14,36
This is a mantra.


172
0:8:14,36 --> 0:8:20,15
That's "Om Mani Padme Hum." This
is from a gravestone, a


173
0:8:20,15 --> 0:8:22,52
Tibetan gravestone.


174
0:8:22,52 --> 0:8:24,33
Then the rest of these
things are deVita's.


175
0:8:24,33 --> 0:8:28,66
All this stuff, all these tribal
things he put on in the


176
0:8:28,66 --> 0:8:31,18
early '70s.


177
0:8:31,18 --> 0:8:34,599
THOM DEVITA: I'm the first
to do the heavy,


178
0:8:34,599 --> 0:8:37,98
what they call, tribal.


179
0:8:37,98 --> 0:8:39,912
I'm the first to do that.


180
0:8:39,912 --> 0:8:42,34
NICK BUBASH: This thing
here he found--


181
0:8:42,34 --> 0:8:44,58
it was a carving on a
stone that he found


182
0:8:44,58 --> 0:8:48,17
on the ground somewhere.


183
0:8:48,17 --> 0:8:49,255
And he brought it home.


184
0:8:49,255 --> 0:8:52,838
And he rubbed it with
ink and pressed it


185
0:8:52,838 --> 0:8:53,68
on a piece of paper.


186
0:8:53,68 --> 0:8:55,41
And he got this design
out of it, this


187
0:8:55,41 --> 0:8:56,7
geometrical design here.


188
0:8:56,7 --> 0:8:58,452
And then he tattooed it on me.


189
0:8:58,452 --> 0:8:59,68
ED HARDY: He did
a great thing.


190
0:8:59,68 --> 0:9:3,9
He put on a lot of elbows that
was off some kind of thing on


191
0:9:3,9 --> 0:9:3,85
the street.


192
0:9:3,85 --> 0:9:7,8
And it was just like, well,
that's a good design.


193
0:9:7,8 --> 0:9:9,295
That's a good design.


194
0:9:9,295 --> 0:9:10,58
It was so important.


195
0:9:10,58 --> 0:9:13,75
That's why in a lot of ways,
like I say, when I went in his


196
0:9:13,75 --> 0:9:16,61
place, it the first time it
really lit my head up.


197
0:9:16,61 --> 0:9:18,78
Because I got so deep
into tattooing.


198
0:9:18,78 --> 0:9:21,11
And it took a long time to break
it through, and go, oh,


199
0:9:21,11 --> 0:9:22,75
these other things could
be great tattoos, too.


200
0:9:22,75 --> 0:9:25,995
And deVita was like the past
master of that stuff.


201
0:9:25,995 --> 0:9:30,27
It was mainly like Zuni things,
Rainbird designs and


202
0:9:30,27 --> 0:9:34,6
stuff, like black
graphic designs.


203
0:9:34,6 --> 0:9:39,12
Cliff was on that big and really
realized how great it


204
0:9:39,12 --> 0:9:40,49
could look.


205
0:9:40,49 --> 0:9:44,306
THOM DEVITA: He was a better
salesman than I was.


206
0:9:44,306 --> 0:9:46,46
ROBERT RYAN: But people could
argue that you were the first


207
0:9:46,46 --> 0:9:49,6
person to do tribal tattooing
in the United States.


208
0:9:49,6 --> 0:9:53,276
THOM DEVITA: Yeah, but if they
were to ask me 10, 20 years


209
0:9:53,276 --> 0:9:56,4
ago, I would have said
it was Cliff.


210
0:9:56,4 --> 0:9:58,54
ROBERT RYAN: But Cliff would
have said it was you.


211
0:9:58,54 --> 0:10:2,1
THOM DEVITA: But Cliff said it
was me, and I believe him.


212
0:10:2,1 --> 0:10:4,858
Yeah, that's Pueblo
Indian design.


213
0:10:4,858 --> 0:10:7,328
SCOTT HARRISON: Was that
on somebody's arm?


214
0:10:7,328 --> 0:10:8,316
THOM DEVITA: What?


215
0:10:8,316 --> 0:10:10,292
SCOTT HARRISON: This design?


216
0:10:10,292 --> 0:10:11,53
THOM DEVITA: Ah, yes.


217
0:10:11,53 --> 0:10:13,172
You looked at my work.


218
0:10:13,172 --> 0:10:14,495
SCOTT HARRISON: A lot, a lot.


219
0:10:14,495 --> 0:10:17,82
THOM DEVITA: It can't be a lot,
because I'm not in that


220
0:10:17,82 --> 0:10:19,452
many magazines.


221
0:10:19,452 --> 0:10:22,296
Yes.


222
0:10:22,296 --> 0:10:25,35
SCOTT HARRISON: He was one of
the first American tattoo


223
0:10:25,35 --> 0:10:28,895
artists to do large-scale
tribal work at all.


224
0:10:28,895 --> 0:10:31,59
It was like him and Cliff Raven
were some of the first.


225
0:10:31,59 --> 0:10:34,2
And he was doing those big
Rainbird patterns that you can


226
0:10:34,2 --> 0:10:36,18
see in that article.


227
0:10:36,18 --> 0:10:39,24
I'd seen him in the white
"Tattootime," the art from the


228
0:10:39,24 --> 0:10:40,65
heart issue.


229
0:10:40,65 --> 0:10:43,76
In the article, Ed made a point
of really focusing on


230
0:10:43,76 --> 0:10:47,82
how Thom's shop and his
environment that he created


231
0:10:47,82 --> 0:10:52,51
was really an organic
part of New York.


232
0:10:52,51 --> 0:10:54,65
The Lower East Side at that
time was, obviously, this


233
0:10:54,65 --> 0:10:58,55
super dense, sensory overload,
kind of place with graffiti,


234
0:10:58,55 --> 0:10:59,93
and all sorts of people
hanging out


235
0:10:59,93 --> 0:11:1,14
with stuff going on.


236
0:11:1,14 --> 0:11:5,44
And how his shop was kind of a
nexus for all these social


237
0:11:5,44 --> 0:11:8,9
forces that were in New York and
congregated there and met


238
0:11:8,9 --> 0:11:14,17
in this weird somewhat surreal
environment that Thom had


239
0:11:14,17 --> 0:11:17,345
created that could contain it
and let it flow through.


240
0:11:17,345 --> 0:11:20,265
NICK BUBASH: Absolutely, he
was blown away by the fact


241
0:11:20,265 --> 0:11:26,13
that Thom had filtered his own
life experience through these


242
0:11:26,13 --> 0:11:30,43
tattoo designs, in a sense, and
turned them into a whole


243
0:11:30,43 --> 0:11:31,11
different vision.


244
0:11:31,11 --> 0:11:32,614
He was a visionary.


245
0:11:32,614 --> 0:11:40,76



246
0:11:40,76 --> 0:11:43,79
But people generally did not
come by, I don't think, until


247
0:11:43,79 --> 0:11:44,46
much later.


248
0:11:44,46 --> 0:11:47,3
They didn't start to appreciate
what he had done


249
0:11:47,3 --> 0:11:49,59
and what he was doing until
much, much later.


250
0:11:49,59 --> 0:11:52,19
I mean, years and years later.


251
0:11:52,19 --> 0:11:54,27
He never traveled much.


252
0:11:54,27 --> 0:11:56,8
Thom stayed put, pretty much.


253
0:11:56,8 --> 0:12:0,65
Occasionally, he would go out
to California to visit Ed.


254
0:12:0,65 --> 0:12:2,96
Occasionally, he would
go to Hawaii.


255
0:12:2,96 --> 0:12:5,93
I mean, you could count
them on three fingers.


256
0:12:5,93 --> 0:12:8,24
But then later on in life,
he started going to the


257
0:12:8,24 --> 0:12:9,83
conventions.


258
0:12:9,83 --> 0:12:13,7
Pretty much after he retired
from tattooing, that's when he


259
0:12:13,7 --> 0:12:14,38
started going to these places.


260
0:12:14,38 --> 0:12:17,905
Because then he would go and
sell his art work is what he


261
0:12:17,905 --> 0:12:19,575
was doing when he wasn't
tattooing anymore.


262
0:12:19,575 --> 0:12:22,66
He needed to make an income
somehow, and that's how.


263
0:12:22,66 --> 0:12:25,402
And he would do a little
bit of tattooing.


264
0:12:25,402 --> 0:12:26,82
But he had gotten married.


265
0:12:26,82 --> 0:12:29,13
And Jenny took a job with IBM.


266
0:12:29,13 --> 0:12:31,62
So, they uprooted everything.


267
0:12:31,62 --> 0:12:34,42
And he figured he would just
open up a tattoo shop there.


268
0:12:34,42 --> 0:12:36,7
In fact, he did open
up a tattoo shop.


269
0:12:36,7 --> 0:12:38,73
He opened up a shop in
Newburgh when he


270
0:12:38,73 --> 0:12:39,97
was 60 years old.


271
0:12:39,97 --> 0:12:42,82
But then nobody knew where
the hell he was anymore.


272
0:12:42,82 --> 0:12:45,81
But there was no business
to support the shop.


273
0:12:45,81 --> 0:12:46,84
He couldn't do it.


274
0:12:46,84 --> 0:12:48,31
I said, you're opening
up a tattoo shop.


275
0:12:48,31 --> 0:12:49,29
You're 60 years old.


276
0:12:49,29 --> 0:12:52,55
He said, yeah, and I'm coming
back again when I'm 80.


277
0:12:52,55 --> 0:12:55,2
I remember him saying that.


278
0:12:55,2 --> 0:12:58,87
THOM DEVITA: I'll show these
guys some of my new flash.


279
0:12:58,87 --> 0:13:1,69
NICK BUBASH: Yeah, you want to
see some of his new stuff?


280
0:13:1,69 --> 0:13:1,94
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
I would love to.


281
0:13:1,94 --> 0:13:4,385
THOM DEVITA: My last flash.


282
0:13:4,385 --> 0:13:6,45
This is a rubbing from
a tattoo stencil.


283
0:13:6,45 --> 0:13:13,24



284
0:13:13,24 --> 0:13:17,812
And this is meant to be put
on a chest this way.


285
0:13:17,812 --> 0:13:20,38
NICK BUBASH: I love the new
black paintings that he's


286
0:13:20,38 --> 0:13:23,64
doing, the black paintings with
the colored drawings,


287
0:13:23,64 --> 0:13:25,855
colored rubbings, and
stuff like that.


288
0:13:25,855 --> 0:13:30,553
Boy, they're just super,
really beautiful stuff.


289
0:13:30,553 --> 0:13:33,204



290
0:13:33,204 --> 0:13:34,5
THOM DEVITA: That's a beauty.


291
0:13:34,5 --> 0:13:41,14
And All the outline is rubbing
and then it's filled in.


292
0:13:41,14 --> 0:13:44,49
NICK BUBASH: He takes the filler
out of those notebooks,


293
0:13:44,49 --> 0:13:47,99
like the black piece of paper so
you can put a piece of art


294
0:13:47,99 --> 0:13:48,43
on both sides of it.


295
0:13:48,43 --> 0:13:50,135
And he takes that piece
of paper out.


296
0:13:50,135 --> 0:13:51,64
It's kind of thin and black.


297
0:13:51,64 --> 0:13:54,13
And that's the thinness
he needs to get a good


298
0:13:54,13 --> 0:13:56,6
rubbing off of it.


299
0:13:56,6 --> 0:13:58,5
He wanted me to send
all the fillers


300
0:13:58,5 --> 0:13:58,77
out of all my notebooks.


301
0:13:58,77 --> 0:14:4,4
I said I'm not going to do
it, forget about it.


302
0:14:4,4 --> 0:14:6,992
THOM DEVITA: I call these
the creative rubbings.


303
0:14:6,992 --> 0:14:8,468
MALE SPEAKER: Creative
rubbings?


304
0:14:8,468 --> 0:14:13,388
THOM DEVITA: Yeah, from
tattoo stencils.


305
0:14:13,388 --> 0:14:15,42
ROBERT RYAN: So, when you first
started making rubbings,


306
0:14:15,42 --> 0:14:20,96
Thom, was it from when people
would share designs with you?


307
0:14:20,96 --> 0:14:22,486
THOM DEVITA: Yeah.


308
0:14:22,486 --> 0:14:24,52
ROBERT RYAN: Before
copy machines or


309
0:14:24,52 --> 0:14:25,746
anything like that?


310
0:14:25,746 --> 0:14:27,204
THOM DEVITA: Right.


311
0:14:27,204 --> 0:14:28,806
SCOTT HARRISON: I was
getting rubbings of


312
0:14:28,806 --> 0:14:30,88
all his acetate stencils.


313
0:14:30,88 --> 0:14:35,4
When I was doing that, he saw
that, and he did a rubbing.


314
0:14:35,4 --> 0:14:35,8
He added--


315
0:14:35,8 --> 0:14:39,33
I think it was either a Virgin
Mary or a Jesus--


316
0:14:39,33 --> 0:14:40,2
he added a Koi.


317
0:14:40,2 --> 0:14:42,1
He just rubbed the
Koi right on top.


318
0:14:42,1 --> 0:14:44,46
And that's when the stencil
rubbing thing started.


319
0:14:44,46 --> 0:14:46,81
And so then he started doing
a lot of that on paper.


320
0:14:46,81 --> 0:14:48,95
And he showed it
to Nick and Ed.


321
0:14:48,95 --> 0:14:50,71
And then they were
like, oh, wow.


322
0:14:50,71 --> 0:14:52,39
I think Ed said, there it was.


323
0:14:52,39 --> 0:14:54,47
It was in front of our faces
all these years.


324
0:14:54,47 --> 0:14:57,99
And he just brought it out,
like you could do that.


325
0:14:57,99 --> 0:15:2,86
Make these crazy things
with the stencils.


326
0:15:2,86 --> 0:15:6,4
ROBERT RYAN: That's the beauty
of Thom deVita is that he


327
0:15:6,4 --> 0:15:7,2
doesn't change.


328
0:15:7,2 --> 0:15:8,86
He's doing what he does.


329
0:15:8,86 --> 0:15:12,3
He's making deVita artwork
every day.


330
0:15:12,3 --> 0:15:14,16
And the trends come and go.


331
0:15:14,16 --> 0:15:15,89
And he's still doing
what he does.


332
0:15:15,89 --> 0:15:17,62
He's kind of like--


333
0:15:17,62 --> 0:15:21,17
I don't want to offend him,
because I know his religious


334
0:15:21,17 --> 0:15:25,0
beliefs-- but he's like the
Buddha of tattooing to me.


335
0:15:25,0 --> 0:15:27,24
He's just there doing
his thing every day


336
0:15:27,24 --> 0:15:29,459
with it, not affected.


337
0:15:29,459 --> 0:15:36,794



338
0:15:36,794 --> 0:15:39,728
MALE SPEAKER: You've got
a lot of artwork.


339
0:15:39,728 --> 0:15:43,48
THOM DEVITA: Some days
I don't do anything.


340
0:15:43,48 --> 0:15:47,59
Some would say it gets out of
hand that I work everyday.


341
0:15:47,59 --> 0:15:52,84
I'm always working just so I got
40 years of work behind me


342
0:15:52,84 --> 0:15:54,66
with no outlet.


343
0:15:54,66 --> 0:15:57,78
So, it looks like I just
recently done it, because I


344
0:15:57,78 --> 0:16:1,408
keep repeating myself.


345
0:16:1,408 --> 0:16:3,94
The tattooers, they're
into prints.


346
0:16:3,94 --> 0:16:9,2
I think prints are the thing.


347
0:16:9,2 --> 0:16:10,94
A lot of people are like that.


348
0:16:10,94 --> 0:16:14,95
They got them fooled
with prints.


349
0:16:14,95 --> 0:16:17,7
Not only tattooers, but all the


350
0:16:17,7 --> 0:16:19,662
galleries, they sell prints.


351
0:16:19,662 --> 0:16:26,62
When I do sell a print, if it's
a print, I work on top of


352
0:16:26,62 --> 0:16:29,476
it, disregard that the
print is there.


353
0:16:29,476 --> 0:16:33,371
It's what I do that's
important.


354
0:16:33,371 --> 0:16:38,93
ED HARDY: In terms of the art,
I mean, none of us were


355
0:16:38,93 --> 0:16:39,78
selling any art.


356
0:16:39,78 --> 0:16:42,43
None of us were doing--


357
0:16:42,43 --> 0:16:43,6
we were just all tattooing.


358
0:16:43,6 --> 0:16:45,61
And, of course, I was totally
open to the idea of it,


359
0:16:45,61 --> 0:16:49,77
because I came out of a
fine art background.


360
0:16:49,77 --> 0:16:52,7
Then when we put that show
together in Chicago, that "Eye


361
0:16:52,7 --> 0:16:54,41
Tattooed America," I thought
that would really do it.


362
0:16:54,41 --> 0:16:55,56
The show got a lot
of attention.


363
0:16:55,56 --> 0:16:56,6
The show traveled.


364
0:16:56,6 --> 0:17:3,5
NICK BUBASH: And it was a show
of primarily tattoo artists


365
0:17:3,5 --> 0:17:5,41
who are also fine artists.


366
0:17:5,41 --> 0:17:8,38
So, I don't know how many people
were in the show, like


367
0:17:8,38 --> 0:17:11,27
30 people maybe or something
like that.


368
0:17:11,27 --> 0:17:12,609
It was quite a few people.


369
0:17:12,609 --> 0:17:16,4
SCOTT HARRISON: It was one of
the first big art shows of


370
0:17:16,4 --> 0:17:17,31
tattoo art.


371
0:17:17,31 --> 0:17:22,72
At that time, even if you
weren't very selective,


372
0:17:22,72 --> 0:17:25,96
finding tattooers who were going
to do some art to be in


373
0:17:25,96 --> 0:17:30,7
a gallery show would have
been difficult.


374
0:17:30,7 --> 0:17:33,355
NICK BUBASH: Thom had
a hell of a show.


375
0:17:33,355 --> 0:17:35,5
SCOTT HARRISON: And the "Eye
Tattooed America" show, I


376
0:17:35,5 --> 0:17:36,25
mean, it was unbelievable.


377
0:17:36,25 --> 0:17:40,1
It was this giant wall
of [INAUDIBLE].


378
0:17:40,1 --> 0:17:43,2
I mean, he sent 300 pieces.


379
0:17:43,2 --> 0:17:45,88
So, he sent his whole shop.


380
0:17:45,88 --> 0:17:48,0
The shop is this organic
part of his


381
0:17:48,0 --> 0:17:49,53
aesthetic, or his house.


382
0:17:49,53 --> 0:17:52,44
I mean, what is less like
deVita's aesthetic than a


383
0:17:52,44 --> 0:17:53,91
piece of art floating


384
0:17:53,91 --> 0:17:56,42
symmetrically in a white space?


385
0:17:56,42 --> 0:17:59,72
I mean, that's the opposite
of what he does.


386
0:17:59,72 --> 0:18:2,21
So, I mean, obviously,
he stole the show.


387
0:18:2,21 --> 0:18:4,85
ED HARDY: It was a really
beautiful show.


388
0:18:4,85 --> 0:18:8,6
Just his perceptions are
so completely unique.


389
0:18:8,6 --> 0:18:10,48
And that's, all these years,
we've been trying to get the


390
0:18:10,48 --> 0:18:12,41
high art world to
recognize him.


391
0:18:12,41 --> 0:18:14,14
And he's just so out there.


392
0:18:14,14 --> 0:18:16,22
And if people didn't understand
the vocabulary of


393
0:18:16,22 --> 0:18:19,77
tattooing and the cultural
context of tattooing, they


394
0:18:19,77 --> 0:18:21,7
just didn't know where
to place it.


395
0:18:21,7 --> 0:18:22,98
They didn't know what
to do with it.


396
0:18:22,98 --> 0:18:25,27
I thought deVita would
make a big hit there.


397
0:18:25,27 --> 0:18:26,82
But these art people
would come in.


398
0:18:26,82 --> 0:18:29,436
And they just didn't
get deVita's stuff.


399
0:18:29,436 --> 0:18:30,66
NICK BUBASH: No,
you know what?


400
0:18:30,66 --> 0:18:33,92
I never expect anything.


401
0:18:33,92 --> 0:18:36,752
I think by that point, I had
already learned not to expect


402
0:18:36,752 --> 0:18:38,62
anything, you know?


403
0:18:38,62 --> 0:18:41,63
JOHN WYATT: This is one of my
favorite pieces by Thom.


404
0:18:41,63 --> 0:18:45,39
The Koi, the colors in it, the
brush strokes, I think, are


405
0:18:45,39 --> 0:18:47,0
just beautiful.


406
0:18:47,0 --> 0:18:50,3
But I've shown his work
to painter friends,


407
0:18:50,3 --> 0:18:51,76
and they were astounded.


408
0:18:51,76 --> 0:18:53,26
They're saying, who
is this guy?


409
0:18:53,26 --> 0:18:54,3
He's a genius.


410
0:18:54,3 --> 0:18:56,39
Look at these brush strokes.


411
0:18:56,39 --> 0:19:1,54
Here's a guy that doesn't have
an art education and is just


412
0:19:1,54 --> 0:19:2,77
going by intuition.


413
0:19:2,77 --> 0:19:4,36
And it's genius.


414
0:19:4,36 --> 0:19:6,19
He's really under-appreciated.


415
0:19:6,19 --> 0:19:9,8
He really should be shown
in a major gallery.


416
0:19:9,8 --> 0:19:13,45
THOM DEVITA: Did I show you
these yet, these landscapes?


417
0:19:13,45 --> 0:19:14,832
NICK BUBASH: These
little vignettes.


418
0:19:14,832 --> 0:19:17,162
THOM DEVITA: Do you want
to see 100 of them?


419
0:19:17,162 --> 0:19:19,26
MALE SPEAKER: Sure.


420
0:19:19,26 --> 0:19:21,15
THOM DEVITA: Come here.


421
0:19:21,15 --> 0:19:23,46
NICK BUBASH: Wow,
look at them.


422
0:19:23,46 --> 0:19:24,71
It's beautiful.


423
0:19:24,71 --> 0:19:32,244



424
0:19:32,244 --> 0:19:34,55
Can you imagine how beautiful
these would be if they were


425
0:19:34,55 --> 0:19:38,46
all lined up, like
all in one--


426
0:19:38,46 --> 0:19:41,456
THOM DEVITA: Yeah, going
down the slope of the--


427
0:19:41,456 --> 0:19:43,4
NICK BUBASH: Of the
Guggenheim.


428
0:19:43,4 --> 0:19:45,35
Yeah, down the Guggenheim.


429
0:19:45,35 --> 0:19:47,905
One right after another.


430
0:19:47,905 --> 0:19:49,66
No, I don't think he fits in.


431
0:19:49,66 --> 0:19:54,64
And I think that's probably why
he should be recognized.


432
0:19:54,64 --> 0:19:58,19
JOHN WYATT: I don't know what
label anybody could put on it.


433
0:19:58,19 --> 0:20:2,89
But it's very different than
what I've ever seen before.


434
0:20:2,89 --> 0:20:4,67
THOM DEVITA: This is
one of my boxes.


435
0:20:4,67 --> 0:20:9,77
The box is a fruit box
from the supermarket.


436
0:20:9,77 --> 0:20:15,29
Oh, I had this in the
library art show.


437
0:20:15,29 --> 0:20:16,515
SCOTT HARRISON: In Newburgh?


438
0:20:16,515 --> 0:20:18,172
THOM DEVITA: In Newburgh.


439
0:20:18,172 --> 0:20:21,476
I've been showing there
for about 10 years.


440
0:20:21,476 --> 0:20:24,308
And I've won about three
or four ribbons.


441
0:20:24,308 --> 0:20:29,27
JOHN WYATT: We all want to see
him somewhere that he gets the


442
0:20:29,27 --> 0:20:32,82
fame that we feel he deserves,
and the recognition, and the


443
0:20:32,82 --> 0:20:33,58
appreciation.


444
0:20:33,58 --> 0:20:38,28
But I think he might be
content the way it is.


445
0:20:38,28 --> 0:20:41,43
SCOTT HARRISON: First of
all, he's 80 years old.


446
0:20:41,43 --> 0:20:43,97
How much do you want an
80-year-old man to work and


447
0:20:43,97 --> 0:20:47,0
hustle and try and start at the
bottom of the art game?


448
0:20:47,0 --> 0:20:49,21
I mean, that's absurd.


449
0:20:49,21 --> 0:20:52,17
He does it because that's
what he does.


450
0:20:52,17 --> 0:20:53,47
He is a true artist.


451
0:20:53,47 --> 0:20:56,44
He makes it if no
one looks at it.


452
0:20:56,44 --> 0:20:59,67
We didn't get to the full
resume of his art shows.


453
0:20:59,67 --> 0:21:1,245
Because some of the art shows
that he participates


454
0:21:1,245 --> 0:21:3,8
in have been at--


455
0:21:3,8 --> 0:21:4,98
I think it was called the
Newburgh Arts Festival, where


456
0:21:4,98 --> 0:21:8,67
they have the amateur
art shows.


457
0:21:8,67 --> 0:21:9,86
And he would go.


458
0:21:9,86 --> 0:21:11,62
And he would set up
his little table.


459
0:21:11,62 --> 0:21:16,4
And he would have exactly what
you see in his house, or


460
0:21:16,4 --> 0:21:18,23
whatever, these super
interesting,


461
0:21:18,23 --> 0:21:20,52
rough montage things.


462
0:21:20,52 --> 0:21:23,23
And he would just sit there with
the old lady who did the


463
0:21:23,23 --> 0:21:24,52
color-by-numbers painting
and whatever.


464
0:21:24,52 --> 0:21:27,18
He would just sit there.


465
0:21:27,18 --> 0:21:29,266
THOM DEVITA: The show's
started already.


466
0:21:29,266 --> 0:21:31,64
I wanted to count how
many people come in.


467
0:21:31,64 --> 0:21:34,792
So, we had to go, and
they still come in.


468
0:21:34,792 --> 0:21:38,65
FEMALE SPEAKER: This
is so cool.


469
0:21:38,65 --> 0:21:39,76
So, you're ready?


470
0:21:39,76 --> 0:21:40,125
THOM DEVITA: Yes.


471
0:21:40,125 --> 0:21:41,726
FEMALE SPEAKER: To
give your spiel?


472
0:21:41,726 --> 0:21:42,945
THOM DEVITA: What spiel?


473
0:21:42,945 --> 0:21:44,77
FEMALE SPEAKER: The
history of Thom.


474
0:21:44,77 --> 0:21:46,1
THOM DEVITA: To who?


475
0:21:46,1 --> 0:21:47,35
FEMALE SPEAKER: To everybody.


476
0:21:47,35 --> 0:21:55,46



477
0:21:55,46 --> 0:21:57,426
So, this is you here
doing this?


478
0:21:57,426 --> 0:21:59,425
THOM DEVITA: Yeah.


479
0:21:59,425 --> 0:22:0,98
CAROLINE: What is your name?


480
0:22:0,98 --> 0:22:1,69
THOM DEVITA: deVita.


481
0:22:1,69 --> 0:22:3,37
CAROLINE: Steve, mine's
Caroline.


482
0:22:3,37 --> 0:22:4,96
And you live in Newburgh?


483
0:22:4,96 --> 0:22:6,664
THOM DEVITA: Yes, my
name is deVita.


484
0:22:6,664 --> 0:22:7,5
MALE SPEAKER: deVita.


485
0:22:7,5 --> 0:22:8,12
CAROLINE: deVita.


486
0:22:8,12 --> 0:22:9,385
OK, what's your first name?


487
0:22:9,385 --> 0:22:9,93
THOM DEVITA: Thom.


488
0:22:9,93 --> 0:22:11,3
CAROLINE: Thom deVita.


489
0:22:11,3 --> 0:22:13,625
MALE SPEAKER: I think people
have been waiting for you to


490
0:22:13,625 --> 0:22:15,6
come down from the hill.


491
0:22:15,6 --> 0:22:17,4
SCOTT HARRISON: I've been
trying to get people to


492
0:22:17,4 --> 0:22:19,34
appreciate Thom for so long.


493
0:22:19,34 --> 0:22:22,67
And now it's like when those
tattooers came in yesterday


494
0:22:22,67 --> 0:22:24,5
and were like, oh, just
wanted you to know we


495
0:22:24,5 --> 0:22:25,54
really respect you.


496
0:22:25,54 --> 0:22:26,48
It just touched me.


497
0:22:26,48 --> 0:22:29,817
And it was also like, where the
fuck have you guys been?


498
0:22:29,817 --> 0:22:31,6
MALE TATTOOER: How you
doing, Mr. deVita?


499
0:22:31,6 --> 0:22:32,804
It's an honor to meet you.


500
0:22:32,804 --> 0:22:33,63
THOM DEVITA: Thanks.


501
0:22:33,63 --> 0:22:34,342
MALE TATTOOER: Yeah,
definitely.


502
0:22:34,342 --> 0:22:37,346
I've been wanting to come and
visit you for awhile.


503
0:22:37,346 --> 0:22:38,846
So, it's pretty exciting.


504
0:22:38,846 --> 0:22:40,91
THOM DEVITA: Where's your
shop in [INAUDIBLE]


505
0:22:40,91 --> 0:22:41,315
Falls?


506
0:22:41,315 --> 0:22:42,56
MALE TATTOOER: Right
on Main Street.


507
0:22:42,56 --> 0:22:43,901
It's called Graceland Tattoo.


508
0:22:43,901 --> 0:22:46,72
THOM DEVITA: Yeah, we pass
by there sometimes.


509
0:22:46,72 --> 0:22:50,79
See, if I was walking, I would
walk by a tattoo shop.


510
0:22:50,79 --> 0:22:53,7
Because I usually don't
go into them.


511
0:22:53,7 --> 0:22:54,56
Because nobody knows who I am.


512
0:22:54,56 --> 0:22:56,375
MALE TATTOOER: We do.


513
0:22:56,375 --> 0:22:57,91
THOM DEVITA: I doubt it.


514
0:22:57,91 --> 0:23:1,666
If I had walked in, you would
have known who I was?


515
0:23:1,666 --> 0:23:2,46
MALE TATTOOER: Oh,
I would have.


516
0:23:2,46 --> 0:23:3,78
FEMALE SPEAKER: He would know.


517
0:23:3,78 --> 0:23:6,615
MALE TATTOOER: Well, I guess
you'd be surprised at how many


518
0:23:6,615 --> 0:23:9,8
of us know you and
look up to you.


519
0:23:9,8 --> 0:23:11,76
I know I do.


520
0:23:11,76 --> 0:23:14,99
SCOTT HARRISON: I just want
Thom to be happy.


521
0:23:14,99 --> 0:23:16,94
And I don't think that--


522
0:23:16,94 --> 0:23:19,19
I mean, I'm sure he'd be happy
to have a museum show.


523
0:23:19,19 --> 0:23:21,4
But he's a very grounded guy.


524
0:23:21,4 --> 0:23:25,11
It would just be another event
in his week if he had a museum


525
0:23:25,11 --> 0:23:26,75
show, I think.


526
0:23:26,75 --> 0:23:31,56
I would like for people to keep
his mind entertained a


527
0:23:31,56 --> 0:23:31,94
little bit.


528
0:23:31,94 --> 0:23:34,476
THOM DEVITA: Six months later
they'd come back and


529
0:23:34,476 --> 0:23:37,242
want to cover me.


530
0:23:37,242 --> 0:23:42,78
SCOTT HARRISON: I would like
to see Thom engaged in the


531
0:23:42,78 --> 0:23:44,9
tattoo world as much as he
would like to be and have


532
0:23:44,9 --> 0:23:52,2
people who respect him to talk
to him and just give him some


533
0:23:52,2 --> 0:23:54,57
kind of integration
into the world.


534
0:23:54,57 --> 0:23:57,7



535
0:23:57,7 --> 0:23:58,27
THOM DEVITA: Here you go.


536
0:23:58,27 --> 0:24:0,89
FEMALE SPEAKER: Beautiful.


537
0:24:0,89 --> 0:24:3,29
I love it.


538
0:24:3,29 --> 0:24:5,64
Thank you.


539
0:24:5,64 --> 0:24:8,4
THOM DEVITA: All right,
thank you.


540
0:24:8,4 --> 0:24:11,41
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank you.


541
0:24:11,41 --> 0:24:13,735
THOM DEVITA: This is taking
longer than I thought.


542
0:24:13,735 --> 0:24:15,8
SCOTT HARRISON: Because your
method is very slow, Thom.


543
0:24:15,8 --> 0:24:19,2
THOM DEVITA: I thought
it would be one hour.


544
0:24:19,2 --> 0:24:19,815
I'm tired.


545
0:24:19,815 --> 0:24:22,7
SCOTT HARRISON: You're tired,
it hasn't started yet.


546
0:24:22,7 --> 0:24:23,6
THOM DEVITA: Put ghost cat.


547
0:24:23,6 --> 0:24:24,34
SCOTT HARRISON: You
got nine hours.


548
0:24:24,34 --> 0:24:25,218
THOM DEVITA: Here.


549
0:24:25,218 --> 0:24:26,468
SCOTT HARRISON: This one?


550
0:24:26,468 --> 0:24:29,42



551
0:24:29,42 --> 0:24:30,15
Where are we going?


552
0:24:30,15 --> 0:24:31,45
THOM DEVITA: Why you got
to keep asking me?


553
0:24:31,45 --> 0:24:33,532
Just put them up.


554
0:24:33,532 --> 0:24:36,864
SCOTT HARRISON: Because as soon
as I do it under my own


555
0:24:36,864 --> 0:24:39,84
direction, you're going
to make me take it


556
0:24:39,84 --> 0:24:40,2
down and move it.


557
0:24:40,2 --> 0:24:44,53
THOM DEVITA: He don't want
to make any decisions.


558
0:24:44,53 --> 0:24:46,64
MALE SPEAKER: I think he
knows the consequences.


559
0:24:46,64 --> 0:24:47,64
SCOTT HARRISON: I'm not getting


560
0:24:47,64 --> 0:24:49,12
paid managerial salary.


561
0:24:49,12 --> 0:24:50,69
I'm just a day laborer.


562
0:24:50,69 --> 0:26:50,69
