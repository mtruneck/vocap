0:0:5,8 --> 0:0:10,0
Good afternoon
It's February 7th, 2012


2
0:0:10,0 --> 0:0:15,1
This is for my daughter, Hannah, and
more importantly for all her friends on


3
0:0:15,1 --> 0:0:20,1
Facebook who thought that her little
rebellious post was cute... and for all you


4
0:0:20,1 --> 0:0:25,0
parents out there that think your kids
don't post bad things on Facebook. Well I


5
0:0:25,0 --> 0:0:29,1
want to read you one I took off my
daughter's Facebook wall that she


6
0:0:29,1 --> 0:0:35,0
thought she was being smart by blocking
her parents from being able to see it.


7
0:0:35,0 --> 0:0:39,1
Hannah, you were grounded for about
three months for doing something very


8
0:0:39,1 --> 0:0:44,1
similar to this, and I would've thought that
with a father that works in IT for a living,


9
0:0:44,1 --> 0:0:47,1
you'd have better sense than to do it
again.


10
0:0:47,1 --> 0:0:51,1
But I just spent about six hours yesterday
fixing your computer for you, upgrading it


11
0:0:51,1 --> 0:0:54,1
for you, and spent about $130 on
software.


12
0:0:54,1 --> 0:1:0,1
And today, I ran across a Facebook post
that you didn't think I'd be able to see.


13
0:1:0,1 --> 0:1:3,9
Since you want to hide it from everyone,
I'm going to share it with everybody.


14
0:1:3,9 --> 0:1:7,3
This is called "To My Parents" by the way.
"To my parents, I'm not your damn slave.


15
0:1:7,3 --> 0:1:11,0
"To my parents, I'm not your damn slave.


16
0:1:11,0 --> 0:1:15,7
It's not my responsibility to clean up your
shit. We have a cleaning lady for a


17
0:1:15,7 --> 0:1:18,59
reason.
Her name is Linda, not Hannah.


18
0:1:18,59 --> 0:1:22,2
If you want coffee, get off your ass and
make it yourself.  


19
0:1:22,2 --> 0:1:27,2
If you want a garden, shovel the fertilizer 
yourself. Don't sit back on your ass and 


20
0:1:27,2 --> 0:1:30,6
watch me do it.
If you walk into the house and get mud


21
0:1:30,6 --> 0:1:35,2
all over the floor that I just cleaned, be
my guest, but clean it up after you're


22
0:1:35,2 --> 0:1:39,8
done getting shit everywhere.
I'm tired of picking up after you. You tell me


23
0:1:39,8 --> 0:1:45,2
at least once a day that I need to get a job."
[laughs] And I love this part.  


24
0:1:45,2 --> 0:1:48,5
"You could just pay me for all the shit that
I do around the house!"


25
0:1:48,5 --> 0:1:52,5
Seriously, are you kidding me? I'll get to
that in a minute.


26
0:1:52,5 --> 0:1:57,3
  Every day, when I get home from school,
 I have to do the dishes, clean the


27
0:1:57,3 --> 0:2:1,9
 counter tops, all the floors, make all the beds,
 do the laundry, and get the trash.


28
0:2:1,9 --> 0:2:5,59
 I'm not even going to mention all the work
 I do around your clinic.


29
0:2:5,59 --> 0:2:10,1
And if I don't do all that every day, I get
grounded.


30
0:2:10,1 --> 0:2:13,4
Do you know how hard it is to
keep up with chores and school work? It's


31
0:2:13,4 --> 0:2:17,1
freakin' crazy. I go to sleep at 10 every
night because I'm too tired to stay up any


32
0:2:17,1 --> 0:2:21,4
longer and do anything else.  I have to get
up at 5 in the morning to get ready for


33
0:2:21,4 --> 0:2:24,5
school. On the weekends, I have to sleep
with my door locked so my little brother


34
0:2:24,5 --> 0:2:33,1
won't get me up at 6."  That part is true.
"This is all true!  And I'm tired of this


35
0:2:33,1 --> 0:2:37,6
bullshit. Next time I have to pour a cup of
coffee, I'm going to flip shit!  I have no


36
0:2:37,6 --> 0:2:42,0
idea how I have a life.  I'm going to hate
the see the day when you get too old to


37
0:2:42,0 --> 0:2:47,65
wipe your ass and you call me asking
for help. I won't be there. 


38
0:2:47,65 --> 0:2:56,4
Signed, your pissed kid, Hannah."
I'm going to address a couple of these.


39
0:2:56,4 --> 0:3:1,64
We have a lady that cleans the house for
us, as a favor to trade off some services.


40
0:3:1,64 --> 0:3:8,35
She is not, and you will never again refer
to her as a cleaning lady. That lady works


41
0:3:8,35 --> 0:3:17,44
harder in one day than you ever have in
your life.  Pay you? For the chores...


42
0:3:17,44 --> 0:3:20,69
seriously?! Pay you for the chores that
you're supposed to do around the house?


43
0:3:20,69 --> 0:3:24,62
You come home from school, and you
have a list of chores that are on the wall


44
0:3:24,62 --> 0:3:31,59
because you can't remember them if you
don't.  They are sweep the living room and


45
0:3:31,59 --> 0:3:36,64
kitchen floor. Which total will take you
about 3 minutes. If the counter tops are


46
0:3:36,64 --> 0:3:42,8
dirty, wipe them down, which takes about
a minute. If the dishwasher is full and


47
0:3:42,8 --> 0:3:47,41
been run, empty it and put the dishes
away. If it's not, just be sure all the


48
0:3:47,41 --> 0:3:52,66
glasses and stuff are in the dishwasher. If
you have any laundry of your own, do it.


49
0:3:52,66 --> 0:3:59,5
And if your bed is unmade, do it. You
don't have to do my laundry. You don't


50
0:3:59,5 --> 0:4:2,31
have to make my bed. You don't have to
make the guest bed. You have to make


51
0:4:2,31 --> 0:4:5,99
your own bed. Once a month or so, I
guess you probably have to make the


52
0:4:5,99 --> 0:4:15,2
guest bed.  Pay you for chores? Are you
out of your mind? You are 15, going on 16


53
0:4:15,2 --> 0:4:19,8
years old. You want things for your
laptop. You want a new battery. You want


54
0:4:19,8 --> 0:4:23,57
a new cord. You want a new camera. You
want a new phone. You want a new iPod.


55
0:4:23,57 --> 0:4:30,17
But you won't get off your lazy ass to
even look for a job. The only job you've


56
0:4:30,17 --> 0:4:35,7
applied to is the one I made you apply to
because I got the application for you.


57
0:4:35,7 --> 0:4:40,3
[Crumples up paper]
You've been too lazy to even carry that


58
0:4:40,3 --> 0:4:46,8
back. When I was your age, I'd moved out
of the house, lived on my own, went to


59
0:4:46,8 --> 0:4:51,33
college while in High School, worked two
jobs, was a volunteer fireman, and still


60
0:4:51,33 --> 0:4:58,5
went to school. Your responsibilities
include waking up on time, and getting on


61
0:4:58,5 --> 0:5:4,8
the bus. That's the end of your
responsibilities each day. You don't have


62
0:5:4,8 --> 0:5:8,57
that hard of a life. But you're about to. I
warned you months ago, about what


63
0:5:8,57 --> 0:5:15,1
would happen if you did something like
this on Facebook again. The last


64
0:5:15,1 --> 0:5:18,89
time you were grounded, and quite frankly
I've forgotten now, but it was for


65
0:5:18,89 --> 0:5:23,3
something fairly childish and stupid. We
took away the computer, that kind of


66
0:5:23,3 --> 0:5:28,96
thing, no cell phone, no Facebook. And I
told you, if it ever happened again, that it


67
0:5:28,96 --> 0:5:35,76
would be a lot worse. And I was really
close that day to putting a bullet through


68
0:5:35,76 --> 0:5:43,53
your laptop. Now this time, I just spent all
day yesterday, blew half my day,


69
0:5:43,53 --> 0:5:50,43
upgrading your laptop.  Putting new
software on it. Spent about $130 in


70
0:5:50,43 --> 0:5:58,27
software to get everything the way you
wanted to have it for school. You don't


71
0:5:58,27 --> 0:6:3,47
have to worry about buying a new laptop
battery. You don't have to worry about


72
0:6:3,47 --> 0:6:5,56
buying a new power cord. You don't have
to worry about buying a new camera.


73
0:6:5,56 --> 0:6:8,23
Because you probably won't be using any
of them, until probably college. I don't


74
0:6:8,23 --> 0:6:18,69
know how to say how disappointed I am in
you, and how disrespectful you were to


75
0:6:18,69 --> 0:6:26,13
every single adult in your life, but kid, you
got it easy... way easy.  It's about to get


76
0:6:26,13 --> 0:6:31,7
harder. It's about to get a whole lot harder
today. Because you're not going to see


77
0:6:31,7 --> 0:6:34,71
this and for all I know, you might not ever
see it. But as soon as I'm done, I'm going


78
0:6:34,71 --> 0:6:39,74
to post this on your Facebook wall. So all
those kids that thought that it was cool


79
0:6:39,74 --> 0:6:45,57
for how rebellious you were can see what
happens. And all the parents may get an


80
0:6:45,57 --> 0:6:52,79
idea to boot up their own kids ass. There
were more curse words in that one post,


81
0:6:52,79 --> 0:6:59,29
just ridiculous. Not happening.
Disrespectful to me, your mother, your


82
0:6:59,29 --> 0:7:5,16
step-mother, your family, your friends,
and yourself. So, I'm going to put a stop


83
0:7:5,16 --> 0:7:11,34
to it right now...
[Picks up the camera]


84
0:7:11,34 --> 0:7:17,69
That right there is your laptop.  You see
it's out here on the ground. This right


85
0:7:17,69 --> 0:7:22,46
here is my .45.
[fires gun] 


86
0:7:22,46 --> 0:7:25,8
That was the first round.
[fires gun]


87
0:7:25,8 --> 0:7:31,57
These are exploding hollow point rounds,
and you have to pay me back for these


88
0:7:31,57 --> 0:7:37,25
too, because these are about $1 apiece.
[fires gun repeatedly]


89
0:7:37,25 --> 0:7:41,3
1..2..3..4..5..6..
Oh yeah, and after that comment you


90
0:7:41,3 --> 0:7:44,26
made about your mom, your mom told me
to be sure I put one in there for her, so


91
0:7:44,26 --> 0:7:49,98
[fires gun] that one is for her. And if I got
one left... [fires gun]... I got two left...


92
0:7:49,98 --> 0:7:54,9
[fires gun]... now I'm out.
So, just for the record, whenever you're


93
0:7:54,9 --> 0:8:0,33
So, just for the record, whenever you're
not grounded,


94
0:8:0,33 --> 0:8:5,34
 whatever year that happens to be,
you can have a new laptop


95
0:8:5,34 --> 0:8:9,79
when you buy a new laptop. And when
you pay me back $130 for the software I


96
0:8:9,79 --> 0:8:15,83
spent on yours yesterday. Hope you've
enjoyed your little fiasco on Facebook.


97
0:8:15,83 --> 0:10:15,83
Hope it was worth all this.
Have a good day, y'all.
