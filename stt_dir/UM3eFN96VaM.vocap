###7 Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
###10 Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
###16 I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire.
###18 Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
###20 The day is hot.
###22 Blah, blah, blah.
###24 The Capulets abroad!
###26 Ha ha ha!
###28 If we meet we shall not 'scape a brawl.
###34 For now these hot days,
###36 is the mad blood stirring.
###40 Mercutio, let's retire.
###42 Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah!
###45 Thou art like one of these fellows
###48 that when he enters the confines of a tavern
###50 claps me his sword on the table,
###52 and says, "God send me no need of thee:"
###55 blah, blah, blah, blah;
###56 and by the operation of the second cup,
###58 draws him on the drawer,
###60 when indeed there is no need.
###61 Am I like such a fellow?
###63 Nay and there were two such
###64 we should have none shortly,
###66 for the one would kill the other.
###67 Why thou hast quarreled with a man
###69 for coughing in the street,
###70 because he hath wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep
###73 in the sun.
###75 Blah, blah, blah!
###76 And thou wilt tutor me from quarreling! Hah!
###82 Mercutio...
###85 By my head, here come the Capulets.
###92 By my heel, I care not.
###115 Gentlemen, good den.
###118 Good den.
###120 A word with one of you.
###124 And but one word with one of us.
###127 Couple it with something,
###129 make it a word and a blow.
###136 You shall find me apt enough to that, sir,
###139 and you will give me occasion.
###140 Can you not take some occasion without the giving?
###147 Mercutio, thou consortest with Romeo.
###150 Consort? Ha ha ha!
###152 What dost thou make us minstrels?
###154 Ha ha ha!
###155 An you make minstrels of us,
###157 you look to hear nothing but discords.
###160 Here's my fiddlestick.
###162 Here's that shall make you dance.
###165 Zounds! Consort!
###166 We talk here in the public haunt of men.
###169 Either withdraw unto some private place,
###171 or reason coldly of your grievances,
###173 or else depart;
###174 here all eyes gaze on us.
###176 Men's eyes were made to look,
###179 and let them gaze.
###180 Mercutio!
###182 I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.
###183 Well, peace be with you, sir,
###187 here comes my man.
###189 Mercutio!
###201 Tybalt.
###202 Romeo, the love I bear thee
###204 can afford no better term than this--
###207 thou art a villain.
###210 Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
###213 doth much excuse the appertaining rage
###216 to such a greeting--
###217 villain am I none.
###219 Therefore farewell,
###221 I see thou knowest not me.
###223 Ha ha ha!
###224 Boy...
###227 This shall not excuse the injuries thou hast done me,
###231 therefore turn and draw.
###234 I do protest I never injured thee,
###237 but love thee better than thou canst devise.
###239 Till thou shalt know the reason of my love.
###242 And so, good Capulet,
###244 which name I tender as dearly as mine own,
###249 be satisfied.
###255 Ha ha ha!
###259 No, no.
###276 Ha ha ha!
###280 No, Mercutio.
###282 O calm, dishonorable, vile submission!
###284 No, Mercutio, no!
###285 Leave me...
###287 Tybalt, you ratcatcher!
###289 What wouldest thou have with me?
###291 Good King of Cats,
###293 nothing but one of your nine lives,
###296 that I mean to make bold withal...
###298 And as you shall use me hereafter...
###301 Dry-beat the rest of the eight.
###303 Please, good Mercutio.
###306 Will you pluck your sword out of his pilcher
###309 by the ears?
###311 Make haste,
###312 lest mine be about your ears ere it be out.
###322 I am for you, sir.
###324 Ha ha ha!
###325 Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.
###329 Come, come.
###339 Benvolio, beat down their weapons!
###341 Gentlemen, for shame! Forbear this outrage!
###343 The Prince expressly hath forbid this bandying
###346 in Verona streets.
###347 Tybalt!
###349 Mercutio!
###351 Leave us!
###353 Leave us away, you coward!
###355 Go hang thyself.
###368 Uh!
###369 Ha ha ha!
###396 Ha ha ha! Hey!
###399 Ha ha ha!
###412 Ha ha ha!
###413 Hey!
###418 Aah!
###420 Cut his hair, Tybalt!
###425 Ha ha ha!
###439 Hey!
###441 Keep your distance, Tybalt.
###446 Hyah! Hyah! Hyah!
###452 Keep away, coward!
###457 Make haste, Tybalt, we cannot wait all day.
###463 Ah, mother's baby has dropped his sword.
###468 Hey!
###473 Tybalt, no!
###474 Abstain from this crusade!
###478 Tybalt, go!
###479 Mercutio, come down!
###494 Begone, begone...
###495 Fly, Tybalt. Fly away.
###507 I am hurt.
###519 Uh!
###521 I am hurt.
###523 What! Art thou hurt?
###525 A scratch, a scratch,
###528 marry 'tis enough.
###530 Courage, man, the hurt cannot be much.
###533 No, 'tis not so deep as a well,
###537 nor so wide as a church door,
###540 but 'tis enough;
###542 you ask for me tomorrow,
###544 and you shall find me a grave man.
###548 Where is my page?
###551 Go, villain, and fetch me a surgeon.
###554 Fetch me a surgeon!
###555 Ha ha ha!
###557 Did he hurt you?
###571 Why the devil came you between us?
###575 I was hurt under your arm.
###577 I thought all for the best, I...
###589 Help me into some house, Benvolio,
###592 or I shall faint.
###598 Whoa!
###600 Whoa!
###601 Whoa!
###603 Whoa!
###605 Yay!
###608 A plague o' both your houses!
###615 They have made worms' meat of me.
###622 I have it,
###624 and soundly too...
###630 Your houses!
###631 He jests!
###635 Mercutio!
###640 Romeo, Romeo...
###644 brave Mercutio's dead.
###668 This day's black fate,
###670 on more days doth depend.
###673 This but begins the woe others must end.
###677 He gone in triumph!
###680 And Mercutio slain!
###683 Away to heaven, respective lenity,
###687 and fire-eyed fury be my conduct now!
###692 Tybalt!
###695 Tybalt!
###698 Romeo!
###704 Tybalt!
###706 Romeo!
###709 This way!
###713 Tybalt!
###715 Romeo!
###717 Tybalt!
###726 Now, Tybalt...
###729 Take the villain back again,
###731 that late thou gav'st me;
###733 for Mercutio's soul
###735 is but a little way above our heads,
###738 staying for thine to keep him company:
###741 either thou, or l, or both,
###743 must go with him!
###745 Aah!
###751 Let him go! Let him go!
###760 Sword, Romeo.
###764 O thou wretched boy,
###765 that didst consort him here,
###767 shalt with him hence.
###769 This shall determine that.
###784 Hit the feet, Romeo!
###788 Protect the eyes, Romeo!
###799 Give me your sword.
###816 Watch his feet!
###848 Hyah!
###864 Give me the sword!
###866 The sword!
###867 The sword!
###902 Romeo! Romeo!
###926 The sword!
###927 The sword!
###929 Give it to me!
###931 Your sword, Romeo!
###932 The sword, Romeo!
###938 Aah!
###947 Tybalt!
###954 Romeo, away, be gone.
###956 The citizens are up.
###958 Stand not amazed,
###959 the Prince will doom thee death,
###961 if thou art taken.
###962 Hence, go away!
###964 Romeo!
###970 Oh, I am fortune's fool!
###974 Oh, Romeo! Away, away!
###983 A curse on the Montagues!
###985 Oh, Tybalt!
###988 Tybalt! Tybalt!
###990 The best friend I had,
###992 oh, courteous Tybalt, honest gentleman,
###995 that ever I should live to see thee dead!
###999 Oh, God!
###1000 Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?
###1002 It did, it did, alas the day, it did!
###1005 Oh, nurse,
###1007 oh, serpent heart, hid with a flow'ring face!
###1011 Was ever book containing such vile matter
###1014 so fairly bound?
###1021 There's no faith, no trust,
###1023 no honesty in men;
###1025 all perjured, all forsworn,
###1027 all naught, all dissemblers.
###1030 Shame come to Romeo.
###1031 Blistered be thy tongue for such a wish.
###1035 He was not born to shame.
###1038 Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit.
###1040 Will you speak well of him that killed your cousin?
###1043 Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
###1051 Poor my lord,
###1053 what tongue shall smooth thy name
###1056 when I thy three-hours wife
###1058 have mangled it?
###1063 But wherefore villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
###1066 Capulet! To the prince!
###1097 Speak, Benvolio, speak!
###1104 Go on, speak.
###1106 Prince! As thou art true,
###1108 for blood of ours shed blood of Montague.
###1113 Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
###1116 Tybalt, here slain.
###1118 No!
###1120 Romeo did speak him fair,
###1123 bid him bethink how nice the quarrel was,
###1126 and urged withal your high displeasure.
###1128 It's true, Prince.
###1129 The picture makes him false.
###1131 He speaks not true.
###1138 I beg for justice,
###1140 which thou, Prince must give.
###1143 Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.
###1150 Romeo slew him.
###1163 He slew Mercutio.
###1172 Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
###1180 Not Romeo, Prince...
###1183 He was Mercutio's friend.
###1185 His fault concludes but what the law should end.
###1189 The life of Tybalt!
###1191 And for that offense,
###1193 immediately we do exile him hence.
###1196 Let Romeo hence in haste,
###1200 else, when he's found...
###1202 That hour is his last.
###1220 Ah, banishment...
###1223 Be merciful, say death!
###1226 Do not say banishment.
###1228 Arise.
###1229 One knocks; good Romeo, hide thyself.
###1232 Who's there?
###1235 Who knocks so hard?
###1237 Whence come you?
###1240 What's your will?
###1241 Let me come in,
###1243 and you shall know my errand.
###1246 I come from Lady Juliet.
###1250 Welcome then.
###1252 Holy friar, o tell me, holy friar,
###1255 where's my lady's lord, where's Romeo?
###1257 There, on the ground.
###1259 With his own tears made drunk.
###1261 There is no world without Verona walls.
###1265 Even so lies she,
###1267 blubbering and weeping,
###1269 weeping and blubbering.
###1272 Stand up!
###1273 Stand and you be a man.
###1277 For Juliet's sake, for her sake,
###1279 rise and stand.
###1281 Why should you fall into so deep an 'ole?
###1284 Nurse.
###1286 Ah, sir, death's the end of all.
###1289 Speakst thou of Juliet?
###1290 How is it with her?
###1292 Does she not think me an old murderer?
###1294 Where is she? How doth she?
###1297 What says my concealed lady
###1298 to our canceled love?
###1300 She says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps,
###1303 and Tybalt calls, and then on Romeo cries.
###1305 As if that name did murder her.
###1308 O tell me, friar, tell me,
###1311 in what vile part of this anatomy
###1314 doth my name lodge?
###1315 Tell me that I may sack the hateful mansion!
###1321 Hold thy desperate hand.
###1322 By heavens! Leave it!
###1327 Thou hast amazed me.
###1329 Thou a man?
###1331 Thy form cries out thou art.
###1334 Thy tears are womanish,
###1336 thy wild acts denote the unreasonable fury of a beast.
###1340 Hast thou slain Tybalt?
###1342 Wilt thou slay thyself, and slay thy lady,
###1344 that in thy life lives,
###1346 by doing damned hate upon thyself?
###1347 Rouse thee, man...
###1352 Thy Juliet is alive.
###1353 There art thou happy.
###1356 Tybalt would kill thee,
###1357 but thou slewest Tybalt;
###1359 there art thou happy.
###1360 The law that threatened death becomes thy friend,
###1363 and turns it to exile;
###1365 there art thou happy.
###1367 A pack of blessings light upon thy back...
###1373 Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her.
###1377 But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
###1380 for then thou canst not pass to Mantua,
###1383 where thou shalt live till we find a time
###1386 to blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
###1388 beg pardon of the Prince, and call thee home,
###1391 with twenty hundred thousand times more joy
###1394 than thou wentest forth in lamentation.
###1400 Go before, nurse...
###1401 Commend me to thy lady,
###1403 and bid her hasten all the house to bed,
###1406 which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto
###1409 Romeo's coming.
###1536 Wilt thou be gone?
###1542 It is not yet near day.
###1547 It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
###1550 that pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear.
###1555 Nightly she sings on yond pomegranate tree.
###1558 Oh, believe me, love,
###1560 it was the nightingale.
###1564 It was the lark...
###1567 The herald of the morn,
###1570 no nightingale.
###1573 Night's candles are burnt out...
###1584 And jocund day stands tiptoe on the misty mountaintops.
###1594 I must be gone and live,
###1597 or stay and die.
###1601 Yond light is not daylight...
###1605 I know it, I.
###1611 Therefore stay yet,
###1613 thou needst not to be gone.
###1616 Oh, let me be taken,
###1618 let me be put to death.
###1620 I am content so thou wilt have it so.
###1623 I'll say yon gray is not the morning's eye,
###1626 nor that is not the lark
###1628 whose notes do beat the vaulty heavens
###1631 so high above our heads.
###1632 I have more care to stay than will to go.
###1637 Come death, and welcome, Juliet wills it so.
###1643 It is...
###1646 It is, hie hence, be gone away.
###1649 Romeo, it is.
###1655 It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
###1659 straining harsh discords, and unpleasing sharps.
###1663 Some say the lark makes sweet division;
###1666 oh, this doth not so, for she divideth us.
###1670 So now be gone,
###1672 more light and light it grows.
###1674 More light and light,
###1675 more dark and dark our woes.
###1682 Madam!
###1684 Your lady mother comes to your chamber.
###1689 Nurse.
###1690 Your lady mother is coming to your chamber.
###1693 The day is broke, look about.
###1697 Oh, art thou gone so,
###1700 my husband, friend?
###1701 I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
###1705 for in a minute there are many days,
###1707 o by this count I shall be much in years,
###1711 ere I again behold my Romeo.
###1713 I will omit no opportunity
###1715 that may convey my greetings, love, to thee.
###1720 Oh, think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
###1724 I doubt it not,
###1727 and all these woes shall serve
###1730 for sweet discourses in our time to come.
###1735 Farewell, farewell,
###1739 one kiss and I'll descend.
###1766 Adieu.
###1772 Adieu!
###1780 Oh, God!
###1804 We will have vengeance for it,
###1807 fear thou not...
###1809 No!
###1811 Then weep no more.
###1819 I'll send to one in Mantua,
###1821 where that same banished runagate doth live
###1824 shall give him such an unaccustomed dram,
###1829 that he shall soon keep Tybalt company.
###1832 No!
###1834 But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.
###1838 Well, then thou hast a careful father,
###1842 one who to put thee from thy heaviness
###1845 hath sorted out a sudden day of joy.
###1849 And joy comes well in such a needy time.
###1853 Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn,
###1856 the gallant, young and noble prince,
###1858 the county Paris, at St. Peter's church,
###1861 shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.
###1866 Now by St. Peter's church, and Peter too,
###1870 he shall not make me there a joyful bride!
###1874 No! No!
###1881 So, it is concluded.
###1886 Son, Paris.
###1892 How now, wife, have you delivered to her our decree?
###1897 Ay, sir, but she will none,
###1899 she gives you thanks.
###1903 I would the fool were married to her grave.
###1908 Soft... take me with you.
###1914 Take me with you, wife.
###1916 How? Will she none?
###1919 Doth she not give us thanks?
###1921 Is she not proud?
###1924 Doth she not count her blessed, unworthy as she is,
###1927 that we have wrought so worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?
###1932 Wretched fool! Let me see her!
###1934 Ungrateful baggage!
###1936 Say what thou wilt, thou shalt not house with me!
###1939 Fie! What, are you mad?
###1941 Hang thee, young baggage!
###1943 Disobedient wretch!
###1944 I tell thee what, get thee to church on Thursday,
###1947 or never after look me in the face.
###1950 Oh, father, good father, I beseech you.
###1953 Speak not, reply not, do not answer me.
###1955 My fingers itch.
###1957 You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.
###1960 And why, my lady wisdom?
###1961 Hold your tongue!
###1963 Good prudence, smatter with your gossips, go!
###1965 I speak no treason.
###1967 May not one speak?
###1968 Speak! You mumbling fool!
###1970 Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl,
###1972 for here we need it not.
###1973 You are too hot.
###1976 God's bread, it makes me mad.
###1982 Thursday's near.
###1984 Lay hand on heart, advise.
###1986 An you be mine, I give you to my friend;
###1989 an you be not,
###1990 hang, beg, starve, die in the streets.
###1993 No!
###1994 For by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,
###1997 for what is mine shall never do thee good.
###2000 Father!
###2001 Trust to't, bethink you, I'll not be forsworn.
###2013 Oh, no! No!
###2016 Oh sweet, my mother, cast me not away.
###2019 Delay this marriage for a month, a week, oh!
###2021 Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word.
###2027 Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.
###2033 Oh, God!
###2037 Oh, nurse?
###2038 How shall this be prevented?
###2040 What sayest thou?
###2042 Hast thou not a word of joy?
###2045 Some comfort, nurse.
###2047 Faith, here it is.
###2050 Romeo is banished...
###2054 And all the world to nothing,
###2057 that he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;
###2060 or if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
###2064 Then since the case so stands as now it doth,
###2068 I think it best you marry with the county.
###2084 True.
###2087 O he's a lovely gentleman.
###2093 Romeo's a dishclout to him.
###2098 An eagle, madam, hath not so green,
###2101 so quick, so fair an eye as Paris hath.
###2104 Beshrew my heart,
###2106 I think you happy in this second match.
###2109 It excels your first.
###2114 For if it did not, your first is dead,
###2117 or 'twere as good he were as living here,
###2120 and you no use of him.
###2123 Speakest thou from thy heart?
###2130 And from my soul, too...
###2135 Or else beshrew them both.
###2137 Amen.
###2139 What?
###2141 Well, thou hast comforted me marvelous much.
###2149 Go in, and tell my lady I am gone,
###2152 having displeased my father,
###2154 to Laurence's cell,
###2156 to make confession and to be absolved.
###2160 Marry, I shall, and this is wisely done.
###2164 Go!
###2196 You say you do not know the lady's mind.
###2199 Uneven is the course, I like it not.
###2202 Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
###2204 and therefore have I little talked of love,
###2207 for Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
###2215 Oh!
###2221 Happily met, my lady and my wife.
###2226 That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.
###2232 Come you to make confession to this father?
###2238 Are you at leisure, holy father, now,
###2240 or shall I come to you at evening mass?
###2243 My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.
###2245 My lord, we must entreat the time alone.
###2248 God shield I should disturb devotion.
###2251 Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse thee.
###2256 Till then, adieu...
###2260 and keep this holy kiss.
###2271 Oh, shut the door, and when thou hast done so,
###2275 come weep with me, past hope,
###2278 past care, past help.
###2291 Oh, Juliet, I already know thy grief.
###2294 Tell me not, Friar, that thou heard'st of this,
###2297 unless thou tell me how I can prevent it.
###2300 If in thy wisdom thou cans't give no help...
###2316 Hold, daughter.
###2322 I do spy a kind of hope,
###2325 as that is desperate which we would prevent.
###2330 If rather than to marry county Paris,
###2333 thou hast the strength of will to--
###2335 O bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
###2337 from off the battlements of any tower,
###2339 or bid me go into a new-made grave
###2341 and hide me with a dead man in his shroud.
###2343 Hold then.
###2357 Go home.
###2360 Be merry.
###2364 Give consent to marry Paris.
###2367 Oh, no.
###2368 Wednesday is tomorrow.
###2374 Tomorrow night look that thou lie alone,
###2377 let not the nurse lie with thee in thy chamber.
###2389 Take thou this phial, being then in bed...
###2395 And this distilling liquor drink thou off...
###2403 When presently through all thy veins shall run
###2407 a cold and drowsy humor;,
###2410 for no pulse shall keep his native progress,
###2414 but surcease;
###2416 no warmth, no breath shall testify thou livest...
###2425 And in this borrowed likeness of shrunk death
###2428 thou shalt continue two and forty hours...
###2440 And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
###2448 In the meantime, against thou shalt awake
###2453 shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,
###2456 and hither shall he come,
###2458 and he and I will watch thy waking,
###2461 and that very night shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
###2467 Give me, give me!
###2469 Tell me not of fear.
###2471 Hold, then.
###2482 Get thee gone.
###2483 Be strong and prosperous in this resolve.
###2522 How now, my headstrong.
###2524 Where have you been gadding?
###2526 Where I have learnt me
###2528 to repent the sin of disobedient opposition.
###2533 Pardon me, henceforward l,
###2535 I am ever ruled by you.
###2538 Why, I am glad on't!
###2541 This is well. Stand up.
###2544 This is as it should be.
###2583 Love give me strength.
###2611 Give this letter into the hand of Romeo,
###2614 in Mantua.
###2650 Aah!
###2652 My lord! My lord!
###2654 She's dead, Juliet is dead!
###2657 My Lady Juliet, my lord. She's dead, she's dead!
###2660 Juliet!
###2662 Juliet!
###2664 Juliet!
###2666 My baby, where is she?
###2671 O lamentable day.
###2675 Death lies on her like an untimely frost
###2679 upon the sweetest flower of all the field.
###2818 Master.
###2820 Balthasar!
###2825 How fares my Juliet?
###2826 For nothing can be ill, if she be well.
###2829 How fares my lady?
###2845 She's dead, my lord.
###2847 She's dead.
###2849 Her body sleeps in capel's monument.
###2852 I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault.
###2866 Then, I defy you, stars!
###2954 Live...
###2957 and be prosperous.
###2960 Farewell, good fellow.
###3031 Juliet.
###3083 O my love...
###3089 My wife.
###3093 Death that hath sucked the honey of thy breath,
###3097 hath had no power yet upon thy beauty.
###3105 Thou art not conquered...
###3110 Beauty's ensign yet is crimson in thy lips
###3115 and in thy cheeks.
###3119 Death's pale flag is not advanced there.
###3128 Tybalt.
###3136 Liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
###3150 What more favor can I do to thee,
###3154 than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
###3158 to sunder his that was thine enemy?
###3171 Forgive me, cousin.
###3183 Ah, dear Juliet.
###3191 Why art thou yet so fair?
###3196 Shall I believe that unsubstantial death is amorous,
###3199 and that the lean abhorred monster
###3201 keeps thee here in dark to be his paramour?
###3205 For fear of that, I still will stay with thee.
###3215 Never from this palace of dim night depart again.
###3223 Here, here will I remain,
###3229 with worms that are thy chambermaids.
###3252 Eyes, look your last.
###3261 Arms, take your last embrace.
###3268 And lips, o you the doors of breath,
###3273 seal with a righteous kiss
###3275 a dateless bargain to engrossing death.
###3315 Here's to my love.
###3346 Thus with a kiss...
###3351 I die.
###3366 Who's there?
###3367 A friend, and one that knows thee well.
###3371 Balthasar. How long hast thou been here?
###3374 Full half an hour.
###3376 Go with me to the vault.
###3378 I dare not, sir.
###3379 My master knows not that I am gone hence.
###3382 Stay then, I'll go alone.
###3387 Fear comes upon me.
###3389 O much I fear some ill unlucky thing.
###3431 Romeo!
###3443 Oh, what an unkind hour
###3445 is guilty of this lamentable chance?
###3493 Ohh!
###3501 O comfortable Friar, where is my lord?
###3508 I do remember well where I should be,
###3511 and there I am.
###3513 Where is my Romeo?
###3518 I hear some noise.
###3520 Oh, where is my Romeo?
###3522 Oh, lady, come from this nest of death, contagion,
###3527 and unnatural sleep.
###3530 A greater power than we can contradict
###3533 hath thwarted our intents.
###3535 Come along. The watch is coming.
###3537 Where is my Romeo?
###3546 Come. Go, good Juliet.
###3549 No.
###3551 I dare no longer stay.
###3553 No!
###3554 I dare no longer stay.
###3557 Juliet!
###3560 I dare no longer stay.
###3563 I dare no longer stay!
###3606 What's here?
###3614 Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end.
###3621 O churl!
###3623 Drunk all, and left no friendly drop
###3626 to help me after!
###3628 I will kiss thy lips;
###3630 haply some poison yet doth hang on them
###3633 to make me die with a restorative.
###3642 Thy lips are warm!
###3655 Oh, no, no!
###3669 Lead, boy, which way?
###3671 Search about the churchyard.
###3672 Go, some of you...
###3674 Yea, noise?
###3680 No!
###3686 Then I'll be brief, o happy dagger!
###3693 This is thy sheath;
###3696 there rest and let me die.
###3809 Where be these enemies?
###3814 Capulet!
###3819 Montague!
###3829 See what a scourge is laid upon your hate...
###3834 that heaven finds means to kill your joys with love;
###3840 and l, for winking at your discords too,
###3849 have lost a brace of kinsmen.
###3857 All are punished.
###3864 All are punished!
###3898 A glooming peace this morning with it brings.
###3903 The sun for sorrow will not show his head,
###3909 for never was a story of more woe
###3912 than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
