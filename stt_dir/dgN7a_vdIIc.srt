2
0:0:14,949 --> 0:0:18,72
It's sometimes put to me that my work is mono-focused on religion.


3
0:0:18,72 --> 0:0:21,289
I say look at the cloud behind that cloud.


4
0:0:21,289 --> 0:0:23,48
My driving interest is psychology --


5
0:0:23,48 --> 0:0:26,319
particularly issues around manipulation.


6
0:0:26,319 --> 0:0:28,39
Religion crops up so much of the time


7
0:0:28,39 --> 0:0:32,9
purely because it constitutes arguably the most systematic implementation of


8
0:0:32,9 --> 0:0:35,98
psychological manipulation we're likely to encounter in our lives.


9
0:0:35,98 --> 0:0:39,7
It's a smorgasbord of exploitation


10
0:0:39,7 --> 0:0:40,73
but it's far from unique.


11
0:0:40,73 --> 0:0:41,86
Here's another one:


12
0:0:41,86 --> 0:0:46,9
pseudoscience -- systems of belief and practice falsely presented as fruits


13
0:0:46,9 --> 0:0:47,7
of scientific method.


14
0:0:47,7 --> 0:0:51,38
Like clouds, religion and pseudoscience can drift into each other.


15
0:0:51,38 --> 0:0:54,6
But generally-speaking, there's no requirement in pseudoscience to believe


16
0:0:54,6 --> 0:0:55,19
in any gods.


17
0:0:55,19 --> 0:0:59,7
Nonetheless, the social and psychological parallels are remarkable.


18
0:0:59,7 --> 0:1:0,63
Like religion,


19
0:1:0,63 --> 0:1:4,55
pseudoscience offers the false promise of easy answers to complex questions,


20
0:1:4,55 --> 0:1:7,6
through unsubstantiated claims of esoteric knowledge.


21
0:1:7,6 --> 0:1:11,87
Like religion, its proponents deflect criticism with all the same


22
0:1:11,87 --> 0:1:13,8
fallacious defences.


23
0:1:13,8 --> 0:1:16,74
Most ironic of all are the defences that denounce science,


24
0:1:16,74 --> 0:1:19,909
when pseudoscience itself seeks recognition based on claims of evidence.


25
0:1:19,909 --> 0:1:21,14
And like religion,


26
0:1:21,14 --> 0:1:24,56
pseudoscience also shines a torch on the tremendous difficulties we have


27
0:1:24,56 --> 0:1:27,7
in acknowledging our ignorance and vulnerability.


28
0:1:27,7 --> 0:1:30,44
When we look at the areas of life occupied by pseudoscience,


29
0:1:30,44 --> 0:1:33,67
it should come as no great surprise that it's all the same territory occupied


30
0:1:33,67 --> 0:1:34,71
by gods --


31
0:1:34,71 --> 0:1:36,89
ie the gaps in our knowledge.


32
0:1:36,89 --> 0:1:40,439
We find pseudoscience mapping out false futures through prophecy;


33
0:1:40,439 --> 0:1:42,95
proposing false communion with the heavens;


34
0:1:42,95 --> 0:1:47,14
we find it offering false hope to the sick; and grinding out an endless stream of


35
0:1:47,14 --> 0:1:49,6
false psychological gurus.


36
0:1:49,6 --> 0:1:52,6
If we take a closer look at those gurus, we see that, just like religion,


37
0:1:52,6 --> 0:1:55,399
pseudoscience can be also practiced by true believers,


38
0:1:55,399 --> 0:1:57,99
genuinely convinced of the validity of their work,


39
0:1:57,99 --> 0:2:1,36
or by non-believers — people acting for personal gain


40
0:2:1,36 --> 0:2:3,51
who have no belief in what they preach.


41
0:2:3,51 --> 0:2:6,869
As with religion, these populations can migrate either way,


42
0:2:6,869 --> 0:2:10,9
with some non-believers coming to believe their own publicity,


43
0:2:10,9 --> 0:2:11,58
and some true believers


44
0:2:11,58 --> 0:2:14,86
waking up from their illusions, only to discover they don't have skills in


45
0:2:14,86 --> 0:2:15,839
any other trade,


46
0:2:15,839 --> 0:2:19,239
leading them to continue in a profession they privately reject.


47
0:2:19,239 --> 0:2:21,95
A religious example of this is the clergy project --


48
0:2:21,95 --> 0:2:25,329
an online community of priests who hold no supernatural belief,


49
0:2:25,329 --> 0:2:29,26
and whose membership ballooned from around 50 in March 2011


50
0:2:29,26 --> 0:2:30,7
to over 400


51
0:2:30,7 --> 0:2:41,29
 in March 2013.


52
0:2:41,29 --> 0:2:45,3
Pseudoscience comes in two broad categories, which we might call kiwis


53
0:2:45,3 --> 0:2:46,239
and chickens.


54
0:2:46,239 --> 0:2:47,37
As the name suggests,


55
0:2:47,37 --> 0:2:49,279
kiwis are totally flightless.


56
0:2:49,279 --> 0:2:50,78
They provide no results,


57
0:2:50,78 --> 0:2:51,709
no evidence,


58
0:2:51,709 --> 0:2:53,15
no testable theory.


59
0:2:53,15 --> 0:2:55,44
Typically, phrases like 'vibrations'


60
0:2:55,44 --> 0:2:59,73
and 'cosmic harmonics' get bandied about, with requests for practical definitions


61
0:2:59,73 --> 0:3:4,129
or these terms leading only to 'ignotum per ignotius' responses --


62
0:3:4,129 --> 0:3:7,969
ie explanations even more obscure than the thing they purport to explain.


63
0:3:7,969 --> 0:3:10,62
Examples of kiwis include Crystal Healing,


64
0:3:10,62 --> 0:3:11,749
Homeopathy,


65
0:3:11,749 --> 0:3:12,55
Reiki,


66
0:3:12,55 --> 0:3:13,569
Feng Shui


67
0:3:13,569 --> 0:3:15,19
and Astrology.


68
0:3:15,19 --> 0:3:17,77
Kiwis serve as armchair pseudo-entertainment,


69
0:3:17,77 --> 0:3:20,909
or as window-dressing to cash in on the placebo effect.


70
0:3:20,909 --> 0:3:24,909
Then we have chickens -- concepts that can take flight for short distances,


71
0:3:24,909 --> 0:3:29,1
with great flapping. This type contains some vestige of workable material,


72
0:3:29,1 --> 0:3:33,29
whether by design or happenstance. But it's weighed down by a lack of rigour,


73
0:3:33,29 --> 0:3:34,84
an indifference to validity,


74
0:3:34,84 --> 0:3:37,179
the introduction of insupportable elements,


75
0:3:37,179 --> 0:3:40,859
and the corruption of any reasonable components — for instance, when metaphor gets


76
0:3:40,859 --> 0:3:41,86
taken literally,


77
0:3:41,86 --> 0:3:43,989
or when phenomena that occur in some cases


78
0:3:43,989 --> 0:3:48,53
are overgeneralised to all cases, such as treating all illness as psychological


79
0:3:48,53 --> 0:3:49,43
in origin.


80
0:3:49,43 --> 0:3:51,939
An example of a chicken would be Scientology,


81
0:3:51,939 --> 0:3:55,2
which employs lie-detector-like technology called e-meters


82
0:3:55,2 --> 0:3:58,51
that pick up subjects' physical reactions during explorations of memories


83
0:3:58,51 --> 0:3:59,799
and associations.


84
0:3:59,799 --> 0:4:1,359
These sessions are called 'auditing',


85
0:4:1,359 --> 0:4:5,239
and emotional responses show up as various swings of the e-meter needle --


86
0:4:5,239 --> 0:4:8,79
the goal being to nullify traumatic responses.


87
0:4:8,79 --> 0:4:10,76
There are echoes of other therapeutic practices here --


88
0:4:10,76 --> 0:4:11,479
after all,


89
0:4:11,479 --> 0:4:15,399
therapy often involves the revisiting of painful memories. Phobia treatments


90
0:4:15,399 --> 0:4:18,62
in particular involve sustained psychological confrontation with


91
0:4:18,62 --> 0:4:19,56
feared subject matter,


92
0:4:19,56 --> 0:4:24,1
until the fear reaction dies away. But Scientology's chicken status is betrayed


93
0:4:24,1 --> 0:4:25,55
by its underlying theory.


94
0:4:25,55 --> 0:4:29,49
Scientology founder Lafayette Ron Hubbard asserted that the human mind was plagued


95
0:4:29,49 --> 0:4:30,75
with 'engrams'.


96
0:4:30,75 --> 0:4:34,1
These are mental recordings of past traumas, purportedly made when we're unconscious.


97
0:4:34,1 --> 0:4:38,9
Hubbard claimed that, during this downtime, we continue to process


98
0:4:38,9 --> 0:4:42,6
every sensation around us, to the last detail. Hubbard claimed these


99
0:4:42,6 --> 0:4:45,69
unconsciously recorded 'engrams' are the source of our irrationality.


100
0:4:45,69 --> 0:4:48,4
The aim of auditing is to rid people of all their 'engrams',


101
0:4:48,4 --> 0:4:51,259
at which point they're said to achieve a state of 'clear',


102
0:4:51,259 --> 0:4:54,439
and to possess formidable mental faculties --however, this might


103
0:4:54,439 --> 0:4:55,41
take some time,


104
0:4:55,41 --> 0:4:58,419
as the individual's whole existence is explored.


105
0:4:58,419 --> 0:5:0,71
Birth itself is considered an 'engram',


106
0:5:0,71 --> 0:5:3,99
which is why Hubbard advocated silent birth .... but it stretches


107
0:5:3,99 --> 0:5:7,28
back further. Events before birth can generate 'engrams'.


108
0:5:7,28 --> 0:5:9,429
And even events before conception.


109
0:5:9,429 --> 0:5:10,349
Hubbard spoke of


110
0:5:10,349 --> 0:5:14,309
'sperm dreams' -- memories recorded when the individual was a sperm.


111
0:5:14,309 --> 0:5:17,369
Hubbard failed to provide any explanation of how a brainless gamete


112
0:5:17,369 --> 0:5:21,309
can perform the sophisticated cognition of recognising itself as a sperm,


113
0:5:21,309 --> 0:5:23,36
let alone record its experience in memory.


114
0:5:23,36 --> 0:5:25,439
But we're soon drifting back further,


115
0:5:25,439 --> 0:5:26,729
into past lives.


116
0:5:26,729 --> 0:5:28,33
And not just human lives.


117
0:5:28,33 --> 0:5:32,21
Hubbard's medical officer Jim Dincalci recalled a drug-fuelled session


118
0:5:32,21 --> 0:5:35,38
where Hubbard fed amphetamines to his son to the point where he claimed


119
0:5:35,38 --> 0:5:35,97
to have regressed


120
0:5:35,97 --> 0:5:37,31
to a clam.


121
0:5:37,31 --> 0:5:40,43
Should you have the time and money to audit these prolific 'engrams' to


122
0:5:40,43 --> 0:5:41,74
the state of 'clear',


123
0:5:41,74 --> 0:5:45,55
you'll then move on to auditing immortal alien spirits known as


124
0:5:45,55 --> 0:5:48,79
'body thetans', which Hubbard claimed are stuck to us in clusters,


125
0:5:48,79 --> 0:5:50,839
and keep us from our full potential.


126
0:5:50,839 --> 0:5:53,31
From alien spirits to past lives


127
0:5:53,31 --> 0:5:56,65
to sperm dreams to detailed unconscious recordings,


128
0:5:56,65 --> 0:6:0,4
none of these concepts bear even a postcard relationship to science,


129
0:6:0,4 --> 0:6:4,24
despite Hubbard's frequent non-specific reference to 'laboratory evidence'.


130
0:6:4,24 --> 0:6:5,28
Pseudoscience seems


131
0:6:5,28 --> 0:6:8,28
irresistibly drawn to the concept of 'the unconscious'.


132
0:6:8,28 --> 0:6:9,78
I'm not a fan of the term.


133
0:6:9,78 --> 0:6:13,49
I prefer to talk about 'things we do outside of our awareness'.


134
0:6:13,49 --> 0:6:16,419
This puts the focus on the things we do, which anchors discussion in


135
0:6:16,419 --> 0:6:17,43
observable material.


136
0:6:17,43 --> 0:6:20,909
When we start talking about 'the unconscious', and speculating on what


137
0:6:20,909 --> 0:6:21,9
'it's trying to tell us',


138
0:6:21,9 --> 0:6:25,55
we're already starting with a dubious, assumption-laden metaphor.


139
0:6:25,55 --> 0:6:28,33
And in the undisciplined hands of pseudoscientists,


140
0:6:28,33 --> 0:6:32,36
this unanchored foundation is liable to drift clean away into


141
0:6:32,36 --> 0:6:33,93
unadulterated fantasy --


142
0:6:33,93 --> 0:6:35,719
taking the client with it.


143
0:6:35,719 --> 0:6:38,929
During her therapy, Nadean Cool, from Wisconsin,


144
0:6:38,929 --> 0:6:41,55
became convinced she'd been in a satanic cult,


145
0:6:41,55 --> 0:6:43,49
eaten babies, been raped,


146
0:6:43,49 --> 0:6:45,119
and had sex with animals.


147
0:6:45,119 --> 0:6:48,219
She came to believe she'd developed over 120 personalities,


148
0:6:48,219 --> 0:6:49,999
including children, angels,


149
0:6:49,999 --> 0:6:51,36
the bride of Satan,


150
0:6:51,36 --> 0:6:52,56
and a duck.


151
0:6:52,56 --> 0:6:56,469
She was hospitalised over 30 times because of extreme suicidal feelings


152
0:6:56,469 --> 0:7:0,309
brought about by the thoughts and images generated in her therapy.


153
0:7:0,309 --> 0:7:4,379
She also confronted her father with accusations of satanic abuse inspired by


154
0:7:4,379 --> 0:7:5,3
her therapist,


155
0:7:5,3 --> 0:7:6,66
Kenneth Olson.


156
0:7:6,66 --> 0:7:9,499
Any chance of future reconciliation vanished a week later,


157
0:7:9,499 --> 0:7:11,569
when her father died of a heart attack.


158
0:7:11,569 --> 0:7:13,36
In March 1997,


159
0:7:13,36 --> 0:7:17,369
Nadean won a $2.4 million settlement against Olson.


160
0:7:17,369 --> 0:7:20,94
As a result of the trial, several other former patients came forward,


161
0:7:20,94 --> 0:7:23,58
with matching implanted fantasies.


162
0:7:23,58 --> 0:7:27,9
'The unconscious' was an exalted entity in the pseudoscience I found myself immersed in


163
0:7:27,9 --> 0:7:29,669
on a recent course.


164
0:7:29,669 --> 0:7:30,719
As I've indicated,


165
0:7:30,719 --> 0:7:33,39
psychology's been a driving interest of mine.


166
0:7:33,39 --> 0:7:35,5
I took it up academically at school --


167
0:7:35,5 --> 0:7:36,99
and pursued it at university.


168
0:7:36,99 --> 0:7:39,469
After my degree, alongside a career in publishing,


169
0:7:39,469 --> 0:7:42,56
I continued my training, taking courses and workshops,


170
0:7:42,56 --> 0:7:46,36
which culminated in a final post-grad course, through which I qualified as a


171
0:7:46,36 --> 0:7:47,999
therapist several years ago.


172
0:7:47,999 --> 0:7:51,229
The staff were passionate about evidence and research,


173
0:7:51,229 --> 0:7:54,61
Then, a few months ago, I felt like stretching myself, and applied to


174
0:7:54,61 --> 0:7:57,75
what appeared to be another great course, offering seminars on a huge range


175
0:7:57,75 --> 0:7:58,77
of subjects.


176
0:7:58,77 --> 0:8:2,75
The course began with a module presented as 'developmental psychology'.


177
0:8:2,75 --> 0:8:7,52
I looked forward to discussing some juicy research papers. Instead, we were fed a welter of


178
0:8:7,52 --> 0:8:9,479
undisciplined hunch and assumption,


179
0:8:9,479 --> 0:8:12,779
on subjects like what the fetus was thinking in utero.


180
0:8:12,779 --> 0:8:15,99
The nadir of that particular discourse came when it was suggested that


181
0:8:15,99 --> 0:8:16,74
consciousness


182
0:8:16,74 --> 0:8:18,629
began at conception.


183
0:8:18,629 --> 0:8:20,72
The speculations on the baby's mental life


184
0:8:20,72 --> 0:8:22,8
got truly bizarre.


185
0:8:22,8 --> 0:8:25,71
I'd highlight particularly egregious passages from the course literature


186
0:8:25,71 --> 0:8:27,38
to read out loud in the seminars.


187
0:8:27,38 --> 0:8:28,78
For instance, this gem,


188
0:8:28,78 --> 0:8:31,509
commenting on the moment babies discover their parents have a


189
0:8:31,509 --> 0:8:32,73
separate relationship.


190
0:8:32,73 --> 0:8:36,13
'An early realisation of the parents' independent relationship is experienced


191
0:8:36,13 --> 0:8:38,74
by the baby as a gigantic combined figure,


192
0:8:38,74 --> 0:8:40,11
penis joined with breast,


193
0:8:40,11 --> 0:8:44,19
stomach, mouth or vagina in endless
mutual gratification,


194
0:8:44,19 --> 0:8:46,6
creating ever new riches in the form of


195
0:8:46,6 --> 0:8:48,8
faeces babies.'


196
0:8:48,8 --> 0:8:49,85
After reading out that passage,


197
0:8:49,85 --> 0:8:53,88
I said, 'Now, far be it from me to throw out the faeces baby with the bath water --


198
0:8:53,88 --> 0:8:55,99
but what a load of shit.'


199
0:8:55,99 --> 0:9:0,41
But the staff member we were with had drifted into a reverie of admiration,


200
0:9:0,41 --> 0:9:3,26
remarking on the 'wonderfully rich language'.


201
0:9:3,26 --> 0:9:4,66
As befits a chicken,


202
0:9:4,66 --> 0:9:7,23
there were islands of supportable concepts.


203
0:9:7,23 --> 0:9:10,6
Defences, for instance, represent entirely observable behaviours.


204
0:9:10,6 --> 0:9:14,35
We can see people 'splitting' experience into false dichotomies of


205
0:9:14,35 --> 0:9:17,36
black or white, saints or sinners,


206
0:9:17,36 --> 0:9:19,88
virgins or whores,


207
0:9:19,88 --> 0:9:21,4
heaven or hell.


208
0:9:21,4 --> 0:9:24,6
We can see people 'displacing' onto more acceptable targets.


209
0:9:24,6 --> 0:9:27,45
The late Christopher Hitchens observed another common defence:


210
0:9:27,45 --> 0:9:28,73
'reaction formation' --


211
0:9:28,73 --> 0:9:32,629
as demonstrated in the almost clockwork regularity with which anti-homosexual


212
0:9:32,629 --> 0:9:36,82
polemicists get discovered in flagrante delicto.


213
0:9:36,82 --> 0:9:40,94
Models were also offered that acknowledge how we re-enact in therapy our behaviours


214
0:9:40,94 --> 0:9:42,51
outside it.


215
0:9:42,51 --> 0:9:44,8
Again, no problem. Well, it's a bit obvious isn't it?


216
0:9:44,8 --> 0:9:47,49
Client complains that people always let him down.


217
0:9:47,49 --> 0:9:52,82
It becomes clear they 'let him down' because he asks unreasonable favours.


218
0:9:52,82 --> 0:9:56,14
Requests to borrow unfeasible amounts of cash,


219
0:9:56,14 --> 0:9:58,62
r drive him to the airport right that second.


220
0:9:58,62 --> 0:10:2,47
Am I surprised when I start 'letting him down' too? No.


221
0:10:2,47 --> 0:10:4,81
It's one of the games he plays with people --


222
0:10:4,81 --> 0:10:6,8
and chances are he'll play it with me.


223
0:10:6,8 --> 0:10:8,89
Concepts like these are observable.


224
0:10:8,89 --> 0:10:12,97
But pseudoscientists aren't satisfied confining themselves to the observable.


225
0:10:12,97 --> 0:10:13,94
Like Icarus,


226
0:10:13,94 --> 0:10:16,73
they try to fly higher than their false
wings will take them --


227
0:10:16,73 --> 0:10:17,62
in this case,


228
0:10:17,62 --> 0:10:32,38
wings of intuition. And like Icarus, the result is a big burned bird.


229
0:10:32,38 --> 0:10:35,69
Throughout the course, as with all pseudoscientific enterprises,


230
0:10:35,69 --> 0:10:39,3
there was no interest in criteria for establishing validity.


231
0:10:39,3 --> 0:10:42,4
Instead, it was suggested that we should simply stick with the ideas


232
0:10:42,4 --> 0:10:43,63
we personally liked.


233
0:10:43,63 --> 0:10:46,46
Me and another student from a scientific background were


234
0:10:46,46 --> 0:10:48,2
very outspoken in our criticisms.


235
0:10:48,2 --> 0:10:50,23
But, in contrast to previous courses,


236
0:10:50,23 --> 0:10:52,35
criticism wasn't welcome.


237
0:10:52,35 --> 0:10:55,22
As is characteristic of pseudoscientific practitioners,


238
0:10:55,22 --> 0:10:59,4
instead of engaging with criticism, course leaders sidestepped it,


239
0:10:59,4 --> 0:11:0,139
became defensive,


240
0:11:0,139 --> 0:11:1,1
dejected,


241
0:11:1,1 --> 0:11:4,96
passive aggressive and resorted to personal putdowns.


242
0:11:4,96 --> 0:11:8,4
In response to my criticisms of Jung's coincidence-denying concept


243
0:11:8,4 --> 0:11:12,8
of 'synchronicity', rather than address the content of my comment,


244
0:11:12,8 --> 0:11:15,13
one course leader told me I should be more open-minded.


245
0:11:15,13 --> 0:11:18,8
I replied that having an open mind meant being willing to hear new ideas,


246
0:11:18,8 --> 0:11:20,2
not having to accept them.


247
0:11:20,2 --> 0:11:23,18
I said the mind shouldn't be like a bucket — letting everything in without


248
0:11:23,18 --> 0:11:24,58
discrimination.


249
0:11:24,58 --> 0:11:26,11
That was gullibility.


250
0:11:26,11 --> 0:11:29,819
It should be like a sieve — applying a critical filter to what we're told,


251
0:11:29,819 --> 0:11:32,36
and rejecting what unjustified.


252
0:11:32,36 --> 0:11:34,52
After a pseudo-thoughtful pause,


253
0:11:34,52 --> 0:11:38,4
the course leader cheerfully announced that she was a bucket.


254
0:11:38,4 --> 0:11:40,43
It was an asinine response.


255
0:11:40,43 --> 0:11:42,14
It was also untrue,


256
0:11:42,14 --> 0:11:44,8
as she proved countless times.


257
0:11:44,8 --> 0:11:46,73
For instance, she was pseudo-analysing me one time,


258
0:11:46,73 --> 0:11:48,42
and I happened to cough.


259
0:11:48,42 --> 0:11:49,509
She pounced on it,


260
0:11:49,509 --> 0:11:51,67
saying her comments had clearly touched on something.


261
0:11:51,67 --> 0:11:52,66
I pointed out that,


262
0:11:52,66 --> 0:11:54,18
as she well knew,


263
0:11:54,18 --> 0:11:56,55
I'd had a chest infection for five weeks.


264
0:11:56,55 --> 0:11:59,54
But she'd already formed a theory about this cough that confirmed


265
0:11:59,54 --> 0:12:3,11
her analysis, and wouldn't entertain any other explanation.


266
0:12:3,11 --> 0:12:6,4
Had she been the bucket she claimed to be, she would've been able to hear


267
0:12:6,4 --> 0:12:9,78
other explanations. She was worse than a bucket.


268
0:12:9,78 --> 0:12:13,27
She exemplified another defining feature of pseudoscience:


269
0:12:13,27 --> 0:12:15,34
rampant confirmation bias.


270
0:12:15,34 --> 0:12:18,96
In his famous paper 'On being sane in insane places',


271
0:12:18,96 --> 0:12:22,1
Rosenhan showed the damaging effects of confirmation bias in


272
0:12:22,1 --> 0:12:23,28
psychological assessments.


273
0:12:23,28 --> 0:12:26,46
He organised the admission of eight fake patients into 12 different


274
0:12:26,46 --> 0:12:27,949
psychiatric hospitals.


275
0:12:27,949 --> 0:12:31,33
On arriving, they complained of hearing voices, which seemed to say the words:


276
0:12:31,33 --> 0:12:32,5
'empty',


277
0:12:32,5 --> 0:12:33,82
'hollow' and 'thud'.


278
0:12:33,82 --> 0:12:34,64
That's all.


279
0:12:34,64 --> 0:12:36,8
They gave genuine accounts of their life histories,


280
0:12:36,8 --> 0:12:38,68
changing only their names and professions.


281
0:12:38,68 --> 0:12:42,18
Upon admission, they ceased reporting any abnormal symptoms,


282
0:12:42,18 --> 0:12:44,559
and behaved on the wards as they normally would.


283
0:12:44,559 --> 0:12:45,94
They followed instructions --


284
0:12:45,94 --> 0:12:47,54
but didn't ingest any medicine --


285
0:12:47,54 --> 0:12:50,22
and they engaged in conversation and journal-writing,


286
0:12:50,22 --> 0:12:53,36
to pass the time on wards where there was little to do.


287
0:12:53,36 --> 0:12:55,189
In 11 out of 12 cases,


288
0:12:55,189 --> 0:12:57,69
subjects were diagnosed with schizophrenia.


289
0:12:57,69 --> 0:13:1,2
Rosenhan noted that the fake patients' life histories were distorted


290
0:13:1,2 --> 0:13:4,47
by the staff to fit popular ideas about schizophrenic onset.


291
0:13:4,47 --> 0:13:7,64
Normal negative reactions to mistreatment by staff were taken as


292
0:13:7,64 --> 0:13:9,91
manifestations of disturbance.


293
0:13:9,91 --> 0:13:13,11
With three patients, even their journal writing was pathologised.


294
0:13:13,11 --> 0:13:16,63
Rosenhan also observed that just sitting outside a cafeteria


295
0:13:16,63 --> 0:13:18,11
a short while before it was due to open


296
0:13:18,11 --> 0:13:21,109
was diagnosed by one practitioner as indicating


297
0:13:21,109 --> 0:13:23,45
'oral-acquisitive pathology'.


298
0:13:23,45 --> 0:13:27,29
The pseudoscience institute I attended was rife with these


299
0:13:27,29 --> 0:13:28,33
pathologising biasses.


300
0:13:28,33 --> 0:13:32,17
Mistreatment by staff was consistently deflected back on the students with


301
0:13:32,17 --> 0:13:34,39
pseudo-analytical nonsense.


302
0:13:34,39 --> 0:13:37,54
When I complained to the heads of the institute about one staff member's


303
0:13:37,54 --> 0:13:41,36
serious violation of ethical guidelines, they suggested my problem with her was that


304
0:13:41,36 --> 0:13:43,26
she reminded me of someone else --


305
0:13:43,26 --> 0:13:45,19
possibly my mother?


306
0:13:45,19 --> 0:13:49,48
I couldn't quite believe the clichéd drivel I was hearing.


307
0:13:49,48 --> 0:13:52,29
I said, 'I'm sure if I came over there and slapped you round the face,


308
0:13:52,29 --> 0:13:55,32
we could have a fascinating discussion about the people I remind you of --


309
0:13:55,32 --> 0:13:56,71
but the fact would remain


310
0:13:56,71 --> 0:13:58,82
I slapped you round the face.


311
0:13:58,82 --> 0:14:3,98
Just like the fact remains that that staff member violated ethical guidelines.'


312
0:14:3,98 --> 0:14:7,44
I could appreciate why most students became apathetic about challenging


313
0:14:7,44 --> 0:14:10,74
these deflections -- it's hard to convey the sheer volume of them,


314
0:14:10,74 --> 0:14:13,12
or the sheer stubbornness of the staff.


315
0:14:13,12 --> 0:14:16,92
But I resolved to bulldoze through every deflection that came my way.


316
0:14:16,92 --> 0:14:19,63
Predictably, resistance increased at first.


317
0:14:19,63 --> 0:14:23,67
At times I'd have three staff members firing interpretations at me all at once.


318
0:14:23,67 --> 0:14:24,68
But over time,


319
0:14:24,68 --> 0:14:28,64
resistance slackened as I made it clear I wouldn't be sidetracked.


320
0:14:28,64 --> 0:14:32,53
Of the many instances of abuse I witnessed and experienced,


321
0:14:32,53 --> 0:14:36,71
the stand-out conflict was a series of exchanges I had with a supervisor about my throat.


322
0:14:36,71 --> 0:14:39,389
Last year, in part one of my miniseries on death,


323
0:14:39,389 --> 0:14:42,95
I shared that I had a throat problem which was initially suspected to be cancer,


324
0:14:42,95 --> 0:14:44,61
but found to be benign.


325
0:14:44,61 --> 0:14:47,72
The condition means my voice gets tired faster than it used to,


326
0:14:47,72 --> 0:14:51,189
and with prolonged use over the day, it can become uncomfortable,


327
0:14:51,189 --> 0:14:52,48
then painful.


328
0:14:52,48 --> 0:14:56,79
I've learned to cope by taking periods of rest and just not overdoing it.


329
0:14:56,79 --> 0:14:58,87
When I shared this information at the institute,


330
0:14:58,87 --> 0:15:0,16
to my bewilderment,


331
0:15:0,16 --> 0:15:3,6
one of the course supervisors deliberately pushed me to do quantities of


332
0:15:3,6 --> 0:15:5,73
sustained reading in her session


333
0:15:5,73 --> 0:15:7,1
that I'd indicated were


334
0:15:7,1 --> 0:15:8,5
out of the question.


335
0:15:8,5 --> 0:15:10,38
Our exchanges fell into a pattern.


336
0:15:10,38 --> 0:15:11,979
I would decline to read.


337
0:15:11,979 --> 0:15:15,949
She would become insistent and argumentative until I got angry


338
0:15:15,949 --> 0:15:18,22
and shut the interaction down.


339
0:15:18,22 --> 0:15:19,24
Incredibly,


340
0:15:19,24 --> 0:15:22,15
the very same thing would happen next time.


341
0:15:22,15 --> 0:15:24,94
I got in touch with the accrediting body of the course,


342
0:15:24,94 --> 0:15:25,819
who were appalled


343
0:15:25,819 --> 0:15:28,45
and told me her behaviour was not only unethical,


344
0:15:28,45 --> 0:15:29,61
but illegal.


345
0:15:29,61 --> 0:15:33,36
Professional or educational institutes are legally obliged to make


346
0:15:33,36 --> 0:15:36,71
what are technically termed 'reasonable adjustments' to accommodate


347
0:15:36,71 --> 0:15:39,93
any physical incapacity that prohibits certain activities.


348
0:15:39,93 --> 0:15:43,87
In my case, that simply meant someone else reads.


349
0:15:43,87 --> 0:15:44,92
More to the point,


350
0:15:44,92 --> 0:15:46,379
pressurising me to read


351
0:15:46,379 --> 0:15:48,52
could be construed as harassment.


352
0:15:48,52 --> 0:15:50,65
I took this to the heads of the institute.


353
0:15:50,65 --> 0:15:54,5
They fumbled a meek defence that my supervisor had interpreted my throat condition


354
0:15:54,5 --> 0:15:56,53
as a psychological condition --


355
0:15:56,53 --> 0:15:59,83
a manifestation of some unconscious anxiety.


356
0:15:59,83 --> 0:16:2,309
I said that was completely unacceptable!


357
0:16:2,309 --> 0:16:4,1
I'd made it absolutely clear to her


358
0:16:4,1 --> 0:16:7,88
that it was a diagnosed condition, for which I'd had extensive tests.


359
0:16:7,88 --> 0:16:13,18
I said, I hadn't asked for her opinion, and she was not medically qualified to give one.


360
0:16:13,18 --> 0:16:14,93
I was furious.


361
0:16:14,93 --> 0:16:19,12
They nodded gravely, and assured me my throat condition would now be respected.


362
0:16:19,12 --> 0:16:23,6
But I knew this supervisor was directing students to disregard their


363
0:16:23,6 --> 0:16:25,87
clients' medical conditions in similarly damaging ways.


364
0:16:25,87 --> 0:16:29,22
For instance, one student had a client who'd lie on the floor during therapy


365
0:16:29,22 --> 0:16:31,13
because he found sitting painful.


366
0:16:31,13 --> 0:16:34,76
Without any medical enquiry, this supervisor directed the student to get


367
0:16:34,76 --> 0:16:36,529
that client to sit in the chair,


368
0:16:36,529 --> 0:16:40,5
declaring that the client's avoidance of the chair was 'an unconscious attempt


369
0:16:40,5 --> 0:16:41,98
to sabotage the therapy'.


370
0:16:41,98 --> 0:16:45,49
The student privately expressed serious misgivings,


371
0:16:45,49 --> 0:16:46,65
but nonetheless


372
0:16:46,65 --> 0:16:47,94
did as he was told.


373
0:16:47,94 --> 0:16:51,87
Steven Weinberg famously said that 'for good people to do evil things,


374
0:16:51,87 --> 0:16:52,679
that takes religion'.


375
0:16:52,679 --> 0:16:55,82
But the same could easily be said of pseudoscience.


376
0:16:55,82 --> 0:16:58,7
These students were good, sensitive people.


377
0:16:58,7 --> 0:17:0,2
I felt sad for them.


378
0:17:0,2 --> 0:17:2,59
But I felt much sadder for their clients.


379
0:17:2,59 --> 0:17:4,65
And that's what makes me angry.


380
0:17:4,65 --> 0:17:6,84
The horrendous abuse of clients.


381
0:17:6,84 --> 0:17:10,66
Chantale Lavigne was reported to have been 'cooked to death' as part of a course run by


382
0:17:10,66 --> 0:17:14,18
self-styled self-help guru Gabrielle Fréchette.


383
0:17:14,18 --> 0:17:18,89
The session in which Lavigne died was part of a seminar aptly entitled


384
0:17:18,89 --> 0:17:19,73
'Dying in Consciousness.'


385
0:17:19,73 --> 0:17:20,81
in which Fréchette --


386
0:17:20,81 --> 0:17:23,98
who claimed to channel a biblical figure called Melchisedech --


387
0:17:23,98 --> 0:17:27,16
had left Chantale, along with eight others, covered in mud,


388
0:17:27,16 --> 0:17:30,87
w wrapped in plastic, then covered in blankets, with boxes over their heads


389
0:17:30,87 --> 0:17:32,7
for nine hours,


390
0:17:32,7 --> 0:17:34,41
with the instruction to hyperventilate.


391
0:17:34,41 --> 0:17:38,47
Normal body temperature is 37 degrees. Chantale arrived unconscious


392
0:17:38,47 --> 0:17:41,53
at hospital with a temperature of 40.5.


393
0:17:41,53 --> 0:17:44,59
It was reported that Fréchette denied responsibility,


394
0:17:44,59 --> 0:17:47,7
that she felt her duty was fulfilled by calling 911,


395
0:17:47,7 --> 0:17:50,25
and that she continued to offer bookings.


396
0:17:50,25 --> 0:17:53,36
Chantale had spent nearly $19,000


397
0:17:53,36 --> 0:17:55,6
on this fatal course.


398
0:17:55,6 --> 0:17:57,95
Bruce Hines recounted how his Scientologist sister died from


399
0:17:57,95 --> 0:17:58,92
breast cancer.


400
0:17:58,92 --> 0:18:2,52
She'd achieved the highest possible level in Scientology at the time --


401
0:18:2,52 --> 0:18:3,63
Operating Thetan 8.


402
0:18:3,63 --> 0:18:7,32
Hines explained that, in the 'almost God-like' Operating Thetan state,


403
0:18:7,32 --> 0:18:9,38
you were supposed to be able to leave your body at will,


404
0:18:9,38 --> 0:18:13,5
to be assured of your immortality, and to suffer no physical troubles.


405
0:18:13,5 --> 0:18:17,15
His sister's cancer was slow-moving and easily operable,


406
0:18:17,15 --> 0:18:20,309
but while Hines acknowledged that many cautious Scientologists take


407
0:18:20,309 --> 0:18:24,75
normal medical treatment, his sister chose not to, believing that 'auditing would


408
0:18:24,75 --> 0:18:25,7
ake care of it'.


409
0:18:25,7 --> 0:18:27,8
She died aged 55.


410
0:18:27,8 --> 0:18:31,7
Candace Newmaker was just ten years old when she was suffocated in a session


411
0:18:31,7 --> 0:18:34,32
of pseudoscientific attachment therapy.


412
0:18:34,32 --> 0:18:36,29
This vile practice


413
0:18:36,29 --> 0:18:39,84
involves the forcible psychological regression of children who've failed to bond


414
0:18:39,84 --> 0:18:40,9
with a parent.


415
0:18:40,9 --> 0:18:45,12
Candace was pinioned under a blanket by four adults, and directed to push herself


416
0:18:45,12 --> 0:18:49,38
out of it, in a simulation of rebirth, to encourage her to bond like a baby


417
0:18:49,38 --> 0:18:50,71
with her adoptive mother.


418
0:18:50,71 --> 0:18:55,25
Despite Candace screaming that she couldn't breathe, and that she was dying,


419
0:18:55,25 --> 0:18:56,64
there was no respite.


420
0:18:56,64 --> 0:18:59,47
One of the pseudotherapists, Julie Ponder,


421
0:18:59,47 --> 0:19:1,21
even taunted her, saying,


422
0:19:1,21 --> 0:19:2,77
'Go ahead and die right now.


423
0:19:2,77 --> 0:19:3,88
For real.


424
0:19:3,88 --> 0:19:5,71
For real.'


425
0:19:5,71 --> 0:19:7,1
After forty minutes,


426
0:19:7,1 --> 0:19:10,57
Candace had spoken her last word and stopped moving.


427
0:19:10,57 --> 0:19:11,739
Even so,


428
0:19:11,739 --> 0:19:13,669
onder continued the abusive ranting,


429
0:19:13,669 --> 0:19:14,5
calling her


430
0:19:14,5 --> 0:19:20,95
a 'quitter'.


431
0:19:20,95 --> 0:19:23,119
When we attempt to run before we can walk,


432
0:19:23,119 --> 0:19:24,57
we fall over.


433
0:19:24,57 --> 0:19:29,1
And that's what we see with pseudoscience all the time -- people falling over.


434
0:19:29,1 --> 0:19:30,23
Into abuse,


435
0:19:30,23 --> 0:19:32,87
bankruptcy, illness and death.


436
0:19:32,87 --> 0:19:34,659
I suspect that will continue


437
0:19:34,659 --> 0:19:35,9
until we learn to respect


438
0:19:35,9 --> 0:19:37,15
the gaps in our knowledge;


439
0:19:37,15 --> 0:19:40,97
to approach them with curiosity and discipline, rather them fill them with


440
0:19:40,97 --> 0:19:43,37
the easy answers of pseudo-knowledge.


441
0:19:43,37 --> 0:19:44,61
In short, to become


442
0:19:44,61 --> 0:19:45,99
'gap-friendly'.


443
0:19:45,99 --> 0:19:50,49
Which brings me to scepticism. Scepticism
is not only the most intellectually


444
0:19:50,49 --> 0:19:51,24
honest position,


445
0:19:51,24 --> 0:19:55,54
it actively crowbars a gap of thought
between stimulus and response so that we


446
0:19:55,54 --> 0:19:56,82
don't react in pat,


447
0:19:56,82 --> 0:20:0,23
non-thinking reflexes. We stop to
consider;


448
0:20:0,23 --> 0:20:1,76
we act with more awareness


449
0:20:1,76 --> 0:20:3,3
and spontaneity.


450
0:20:3,3 --> 0:20:7,89
Scepticism could've crowbarred a gap of thought into Candace Newmaker's killers,


451
0:20:7,89 --> 0:20:12,36
who might've stopped to investigate her cries, rather than numbly dismiss them.


452
0:20:12,36 --> 0:20:15,79
Scepticism could also help chickens evolve to fly long distance --


453
0:20:15,79 --> 0:20:17,9
if they streamlined


454
0:20:17,9 --> 0:20:18,33
their billowy excesses


455
0:20:18,33 --> 0:20:21,87
and started applying serious discipline to their lazy,


456
0:20:21,87 --> 0:20:23,71
wack theories.


457
0:20:23,71 --> 0:20:25,769
In view of everything I've said about pseudoscience,


458
0:20:25,769 --> 0:20:29,21
don't think me a hypocrite if I end by proposing a new metaphorical


459
0:20:29,21 --> 0:20:30,66
pseudoscience of my own.


460
0:20:30,66 --> 0:20:32,94
A kind of avian alchemy.


461
0:20:32,94 --> 0:20:35,6
Let's turn these kiwis and chickens


462
0:20:35,6 --> 0:20:37,0
into


463
0:20:37,0 --> 0:20:47,14
dodos.


464
0:20:47,14 --> 0:22:47,14
pair
