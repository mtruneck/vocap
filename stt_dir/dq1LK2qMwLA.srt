1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:1,25



2
0:0:1,25 --> 0:0:21,89



3
0:0:21,89 --> 0:0:23,72
SIMON OSTROVSKY: We just
arrived in Tel Aviv.


4
0:0:23,72 --> 0:0:25,7
We're here on the beach.


5
0:0:25,7 --> 0:0:26,16
It's really nice.


6
0:0:26,16 --> 0:0:30,34
It's deceptively nice, because
20 miles that way is the West


7
0:0:30,34 --> 0:0:34,5
Bank, which Israel has been
occupying since 1967.


8
0:0:34,5 --> 0:0:36,75
And the reason we're interested
in the West Bank is


9
0:0:36,75 --> 0:0:39,42
because the other thing that
Israel has been doing there is


10
0:0:39,42 --> 0:0:40,71
building settlements.


11
0:0:40,71 --> 0:0:42,56
So we're going to head
over there and find


12
0:0:42,56 --> 0:0:43,81
out what that's like.


13
0:0:43,81 --> 0:0:50,27



14
0:0:50,27 --> 0:0:54,2
Israel conquered the West Bank
in East Jerusalem in 1967,


15
0:0:54,2 --> 0:0:57,2
after three Arab nations battled
the newly minted


16
0:0:57,2 --> 0:0:59,88
Jewish state in the
Six Days War.


17
0:0:59,88 --> 0:1:2,81
Israel was only 20 years old at
the time, and its victory


18
0:1:2,81 --> 0:1:6,1
was hailed as a David versus
Goliath triumph.


19
0:1:6,1 --> 0:1:8,72
A lot of water has passed under
the bridge since then,


20
0:1:8,72 --> 0:1:11,35
and what was supposed to have
been a temporary occupation of


21
0:1:11,35 --> 0:1:14,55
the Palestinian territories
has turned into four and a


22
0:1:14,55 --> 0:1:16,28
half decades of misery
for the Arab


23
0:1:16,28 --> 0:1:18,44
residents in the West Bank.


24
0:1:18,44 --> 0:1:20,88
Aside from the fact that the
West Bank is crisscrossed with


25
0:1:20,88 --> 0:1:23,88
barbed wire, walls and military
checkpoints, over


26
0:1:23,88 --> 0:1:28,36
300,000 Israelis have taken it
upon themselves to settle what


27
0:1:28,36 --> 0:1:32,11
was supposed to be the future
Palestinian state.


28
0:1:32,11 --> 0:1:35,9
According to international
law, the settlements are


29
0:1:35,9 --> 0:1:36,44
totally illegal.


30
0:1:36,44 --> 0:1:39,44
They represent a colonization
of the lands that are slated


31
0:1:39,44 --> 0:1:41,95
for hand over to the
Palestinians under an


32
0:1:41,95 --> 0:1:43,78
agreement that both
Israel and the


33
0:1:43,78 --> 0:1:46,9
Palestinians signed in 1993.


34
0:1:46,9 --> 0:1:49,96
As a result, the peace process
has ground to a halt.


35
0:1:49,96 --> 0:1:52,8
And the much lauded two state
solution is looking less


36
0:1:52,8 --> 0:1:54,33
likely than ever before.


37
0:1:54,33 --> 0:1:57,42



38
0:1:57,42 --> 0:2:0,42
I wanted to find out who the
settlers were and what


39
0:2:0,42 --> 0:2:3,17
motivated them to pick up sticks
and move across the


40
0:2:3,17 --> 0:2:6,85
green line to become the most
notorious squatters the world


41
0:2:6,85 --> 0:2:8,27
has ever known.


42
0:2:8,27 --> 0:2:11,12
But first, I decided to get
some counter-terrorism


43
0:2:11,12 --> 0:2:13,98
training in a West Bank gun
range with a member of


44
0:2:13,98 --> 0:2:17,52
Israel's special forces,
just in case.


45
0:2:17,52 --> 0:2:20,3
We're in a firing range in a
settlement in the West Bank,


46
0:2:20,3 --> 0:2:22,97
and these guys behind me are
civilians training to do


47
0:2:22,97 --> 0:2:24,4
border security.


48
0:2:24,4 --> 0:2:26,483
And they've got some pretty
mean looking guns.


49
0:2:26,483 --> 0:2:28,61
STEVEN GAR: Is this
a safe gun?


50
0:2:28,61 --> 0:2:30,2
No such thing as a safe gun.


51
0:2:30,2 --> 0:2:31,45
Guns are made for killing.


52
0:2:31,45 --> 0:2:40,17



53
0:2:40,17 --> 0:2:42,87
You're standing at the entrance
to the synagogue.


54
0:2:42,87 --> 0:2:44,64
Inside, there's a terror
attack happening.


55
0:2:44,64 --> 0:2:45,98
OK, I want you to imagine.


56
0:2:45,98 --> 0:2:48,48
You're standing in ready
position, pointing your weapon


57
0:2:48,48 --> 0:2:51,16
inside the synagogue trying to
take care of the terrorists.


58
0:2:51,16 --> 0:2:54,14
Remember how we defined
counter-terrorism as combat in


59
0:2:54,14 --> 0:2:55,45
a civilian area.


60
0:2:55,45 --> 0:2:57,31
We don't want to
hurt civilians.


61
0:2:57,31 --> 0:2:59,53
We have to protect
them, correct?


62
0:2:59,53 --> 0:3:1,18
This is not an Xbox.


63
0:3:1,18 --> 0:3:1,78
It's not games.


64
0:3:1,78 --> 0:3:4,48
We don't push a reset button and
then you get a new life.


65
0:3:4,48 --> 0:3:6,36
There's real bullets outside.


66
0:3:6,36 --> 0:3:8,34
There's a real possibility
that I'll


67
0:3:8,34 --> 0:3:11,134
never see my kids again.


68
0:3:11,134 --> 0:3:13,93
Up!


69
0:3:13,93 --> 0:3:15,268
Simon's scared of me.


70
0:3:15,268 --> 0:3:16,9
SIMON OSTROVSKY: No shit.


71
0:3:16,9 --> 0:3:19,4
I was starting to think this
guy's job was just to scare


72
0:3:19,4 --> 0:3:21,46
the crap out of anyone who
showed up for the training.


73
0:3:21,46 --> 0:3:26,4



74
0:3:26,4 --> 0:3:28,32
Turns out, I wasn't the only one
who thought it would be a


75
0:3:28,32 --> 0:3:30,56
good idea to get
some training.


76
0:3:30,56 --> 0:3:33,72
A Canadian woman we nicknamed
Sarah Connor had brought her


77
0:3:33,72 --> 0:3:36,25
whole family along for
the fear fest.


78
0:3:36,25 --> 0:3:40,3
It doesn't hurt to know how to
use an AK, though, right?


79
0:3:40,3 --> 0:3:42,51
And for what it's worth, her
daughter turned out to be a


80
0:3:42,51 --> 0:3:43,76
pretty good marksman.


81
0:3:43,76 --> 0:3:47,65



82
0:3:47,65 --> 0:3:48,88
Well, I hit it twice.


83
0:3:48,88 --> 0:3:51,13
I didn't do as good as
the 10-year-old girl.


84
0:3:51,13 --> 0:3:51,99
STEVEN GAR: Not bad.


85
0:3:51,99 --> 0:3:54,5
SIMON OSTROVSKY: Do you think
it's important for everybody


86
0:3:54,5 --> 0:3:56,44
who moves to Israel to
have this kind of


87
0:3:56,44 --> 0:3:58,1
counter-terrorism training?


88
0:3:58,1 --> 0:3:59,17
STEVEN GAR: Look,
counter-terrorism training, I


89
0:3:59,17 --> 0:4:1,26
don't think it's important for
everyone, unless you're a


90
0:4:1,26 --> 0:4:1,33
counter-terrorist.


91
0:4:1,33 --> 0:4:3,87
You have to have an awareness
of terrorism.


92
0:4:3,87 --> 0:4:6,167
SIMON OSTROVSKY: So why do so
many people carry around guns?


93
0:4:6,167 --> 0:4:7,83
STEVEN GAR: I don't know.


94
0:4:7,83 --> 0:4:7,39
I don't know.


95
0:4:7,39 --> 0:4:10,29
Maybe to feel safer.


96
0:4:10,29 --> 0:4:12,32
I think people think, you know,
I've got a gun at home


97
0:4:12,32 --> 0:4:15,11
and I wake up and there's a
terrorist, I could take care


98
0:4:15,11 --> 0:4:16,22
of my family.


99
0:4:16,22 --> 0:4:18,47
Maybe that's what's going
through their minds.


100
0:4:18,47 --> 0:4:20,829
SIMON OSTROVSKY: I discovered
that it was easy for a settler


101
0:4:20,829 --> 0:4:23,22
to get a gun license
in the West Bank.


102
0:4:23,22 --> 0:4:25,56
All they had to do was
qualify at a shooting


103
0:4:25,56 --> 0:4:26,66
range like this one.


104
0:4:26,66 --> 0:4:30,83
But Palestinians living in the
same area are never packing,


105
0:4:30,83 --> 0:4:34,12
because Israel doesn't
allow it.


106
0:4:34,12 --> 0:4:37,42
It turned out our trainer Steve
was himself a settler


107
0:4:37,42 --> 0:4:40,42
who'd moved into the West
Bank from South Africa.


108
0:4:40,42 --> 0:4:43,9
When we arrived at his
settlement, I was surprised to


109
0:4:43,9 --> 0:4:45,38
see it looked more like an
American suburb than an


110
0:4:45,38 --> 0:4:47,585
outpost in a hostile
territory.


111
0:4:47,585 --> 0:4:51,67
The community that you live in
was built in the particular


112
0:4:51,67 --> 0:4:53,7
place that it was built because
of the historic


113
0:4:53,7 --> 0:4:55,12
significance of the place.


114
0:4:55,12 --> 0:4:55,46
STEVEN GAR: Yeah.


115
0:4:55,46 --> 0:4:59,36
Most of the little areas here,
they've actually found signs


116
0:4:59,36 --> 0:5:2,94
of ancient Jewish settlement
there.


117
0:5:2,94 --> 0:5:5,45
We feel that it's like
reviving the


118
0:5:5,45 --> 0:5:6,66
past kind of thing.


119
0:5:6,66 --> 0:5:7,34
SIMON OSTROVSKY: Right.


120
0:5:7,34 --> 0:5:8,51
So you're saying--


121
0:5:8,51 --> 0:5:10,3
your settlement is right
on the right here.


122
0:5:10,3 --> 0:5:12,49
And some fields that
are used by


123
0:5:12,49 --> 0:5:13,99
Palestinians are on the left.


124
0:5:13,99 --> 0:5:16,93
Are there any confrontations
between the people working in


125
0:5:16,93 --> 0:5:19,445
these fields and people
from your settlement?


126
0:5:19,445 --> 0:5:20,88
STEVEN GAR: Not often.


127
0:5:20,88 --> 0:5:25,75
Occasionally I've been called
in to what we call a hadira,


128
0:5:25,75 --> 0:5:27,52
that's an infiltration.


129
0:5:27,52 --> 0:5:30,31
I've caught, on a few occasions,
Arabs that have


130
0:5:30,31 --> 0:5:31,83
infiltrated the settlement.


131
0:5:31,83 --> 0:5:33,26
They've come to steal.


132
0:5:33,26 --> 0:5:36,47
In my mind, also, I think it's
quite a clever way for them to


133
0:5:36,47 --> 0:5:39,95
gather information, see how
quickly we react, by taking


134
0:5:39,95 --> 0:5:41,1
all this information in.


135
0:5:41,1 --> 0:5:42,96
So we've got to be
really alert.


136
0:5:42,96 --> 0:5:44,72
SIMON OSTROVSKY: Do you ever
worry about your kids, that


137
0:5:44,72 --> 0:5:45,97
they could get hurt?


138
0:5:45,97 --> 0:5:48,355



139
0:5:48,355 --> 0:5:49,19
STEVEN GAR: I think
every parent


140
0:5:49,19 --> 0:5:51,42
worries about their kids.


141
0:5:51,42 --> 0:5:53,81
SIMON OSTROVSKY: But do you ever
question your decision to


142
0:5:53,81 --> 0:5:57,75
bring them out here, in such
close proximity to people who


143
0:5:57,75 --> 0:5:59,16
aren't very happy with
your presence?


144
0:5:59,16 --> 0:5:59,24
STEVEN GAR: No.


145
0:5:59,24 --> 0:5:59,525
No.


146
0:5:59,525 --> 0:6:7,28
I'll tell you, that's not
something I think about.


147
0:6:7,28 --> 0:6:9,66
SIMON OSTROVSKY: It turns out,
the Israeli state has given


148
0:6:9,66 --> 0:6:11,31
his settlement, and
many others like


149
0:6:11,31 --> 0:6:12,76
it, its full backing.


150
0:6:12,76 --> 0:6:16,29
But like most settlements, it
hadn't started out this way.


151
0:6:16,29 --> 0:6:18,45
It was once an encampment
that was considered


152
0:6:18,45 --> 0:6:20,5
illegal, even by Israel.


153
0:6:20,5 --> 0:6:22,84
But over the years, the settlers
have learned that if


154
0:6:22,84 --> 0:6:25,88
they squat a site in the West
Bank long enough, Israel will


155
0:6:25,88 --> 0:6:27,27
give them its approval, its


156
0:6:27,27 --> 0:6:31,32
infrastructure, and its security.


157
0:6:31,32 --> 0:6:34,685
You don't feel that coming here
would provoke your Arab


158
0:6:34,685 --> 0:6:38,92
neighbors, though,
into violence?


159
0:6:38,92 --> 0:6:40,17
STEVEN GAR: I don't
see why it should.


160
0:6:40,17 --> 0:6:43,6
Look, again, what I'm saying
is that I don't think that


161
0:6:43,6 --> 0:6:44,48
it's right taking other
people's land.


162
0:6:44,48 --> 0:6:46,49
I don't think it's
right for me to--


163
0:6:46,49 --> 0:6:47,37
these guys are working hard.


164
0:6:47,37 --> 0:6:49,72
They've been working these
fields now for maybe two


165
0:6:49,72 --> 0:6:51,15
generations.


166
0:6:51,15 --> 0:6:52,43
You should just now,
that's maximum.


167
0:6:52,43 --> 0:6:55,2
When we talk about Palestinian
people, we're maximum talking


168
0:6:55,2 --> 0:6:58,72
about maybe one and a half
to two generations.


169
0:6:58,72 --> 0:7:0,83
The Jewish people have been
here for 5,000 years.


170
0:7:0,83 --> 0:7:4,67
This dates back another 3,000
years ago that this


171
0:7:4,67 --> 0:7:6,53
was active and used.


172
0:7:6,53 --> 0:7:9,7
We're not just a fabrication
that this is, oh,


173
0:7:9,7 --> 0:7:11,4
we want this place.


174
0:7:11,4 --> 0:7:13,7
Understand that though we're
here for whatever reasons, we


175
0:7:13,7 --> 0:7:16,85
were exiled out of Israel, but
we were given the opportunity


176
0:7:16,85 --> 0:7:18,59
to come back.


177
0:7:18,59 --> 0:7:20,61
SIMON OSTROVSKY: Now this was
an incredible fabrication on


178
0:7:20,61 --> 0:7:21,78
Steve's part.


179
0:7:21,78 --> 0:7:24,5
The notion that the Palestinians
had only lived on


180
0:7:24,5 --> 0:7:27,25
this land for two generations
was totally false.


181
0:7:27,25 --> 0:7:30,3
But the idea that Jews had a
historic claim to the West


182
0:7:30,3 --> 0:7:33,81
Bank's territories that trumped
any Palestinian claims


183
0:7:33,81 --> 0:7:37,18
was one I'd hear over and over
in the next few days, and


184
0:7:37,18 --> 0:7:40,2
turned out to be a major part
of the settler ideology that


185
0:7:40,2 --> 0:7:44,49
ran directly counter to the
two state solution plan.


186
0:7:44,49 --> 0:7:45,8
Steve was an interesting guy.


187
0:7:45,8 --> 0:7:49,47
Our shooting instructor is also
a settler, and somehow he


188
0:7:49,47 --> 0:7:52,91
made being a commando in the
West Bank seem almost normal.


189
0:7:52,91 --> 0:7:55,28
But the settlement he's from is
really established, and we


190
0:7:55,28 --> 0:7:58,0
want to find places that are
newer, where people are


191
0:7:58,0 --> 0:8:1,25
literally on an encampment at
the top of a hill and starting


192
0:8:1,25 --> 0:8:2,5
a brand new settlement.


193
0:8:2,5 --> 0:8:5,84



194
0:8:5,84 --> 0:8:8,56
But they're on the wrong side
of the green line for doing


195
0:8:8,56 --> 0:8:10,212
archaeological digs.


196
0:8:10,212 --> 0:8:10,69
SOLDIER: This land?


197
0:8:10,69 --> 0:8:14,6
It's for the Jewish people from
all over the world, OK?


198
0:8:14,6 --> 0:8:16,79
MALE SPEAKER: Are you
recording me?


199
0:8:16,79 --> 0:8:17,12
SIMON OSTROVSKY: I don't know.


200
0:8:17,12 --> 0:8:18,58
I don't know.


201
0:8:18,58 --> 0:10:18,58
