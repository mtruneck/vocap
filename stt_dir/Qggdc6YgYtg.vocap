###0 does have one of course is known for going out for the banks and uh... now
###4 that you senator from massachusetts
###7 not just one of the banks that you do your job going after the regulators
###11 so that's a real problem because the regulators have done nothing
###15 to go after the big banks
###16 beshi question the regulators before news is great moment we should ask them
###20 he when's the last time you brought to the top banking service to trial
###24 we should all the regulators lined up
###26 and not one of them could answer because it was so far back know what we're
###31 member of the last time they brought
###33 and big bang executive to trial right so this time around to pass them
###37 but we've just
###38 video
###39 where you protected the bankers again
###42 and but you know
###43 all that what they were doing in for closing outhouses was wrong
###46 ish in a bid for closing on those houses
###48 and your job is to protect consumers so she's got a question amman that town and
###53 it's going to be a loss
###54 regarding the basic data and
###57 processes of the independent foreclosure review
###60 we may fourteen specific request to you in january
###64 and despite multiple letters back and forth and multiple meetings
###69 you have provided only one full response
###73 three partial or a minimal responses and no response to nine of our requests
###83 cashiers they haven't asked for
###85 that you know you're supposed to be accountable palace you're supposed to
###89 call the government you're holding the bank's account of what we're past the
###92 are you doing your job we have nothing from you as she cited daniels the
###96 powerful loss of the control of the currency in which a dash in or the
###99 federal reserve board of governors and these are supposed to be really good
###102 banks now let's watch what happens
###104 you know have evidence
###106 in your files
###108 all of the illegal activity i'd take it for some of these banks
###113 it's affair really wants to bring a lawsuit
###116 you're both lawyers would it be helpful if you're going against one of these
###121 people banks would it be helpful for these families
###125 to have the information about their case
###128 that's in your finals
###130 possession
###132 it would uh...
###133 you would be helpful obviously there have been for mation related to be
###137 entering that should work
###140 so
###140 do you plan to give the families
###143 this information
###145 i think that's a decision that we're still considering we haven't made a
###148 final decision yet
###150 so you have made a decision to protect the banks but not a decision to tell the
###153 families who were illegally foreclosed against
###157 we have made a decision about when information we will provide the
###160 individuals
###163 mistress to pune
###164 receptionist
###166 the embarrassment that he had in that
###169 like split-second
###170 at the end at the end yet latrines gonna crimea like uh...
###174 that was officer was under which
###177 shane that's what was that's exactly right
###181 and he had the same insecure
###183 you're right now we have protected the banks
###186 we have not given the information that they needed to
###189 to protect the consumers
###191 who were the victims yes you're right that's exactly what we've done
###195 the exact opposite of what we were trying to appeal it's great to see it
###199 was before doing this you know we talked about this uh... leaving before the show
###202 because back in february she went out the regulators as you
###205 as you mentioned the plot all the court that the other course grade
###208 also is there was a e described as a top executive atop for banking executive
###215 emailed
###216 to pull it off
###217 uh... well and said well senator warner never write cast pointed questions of
###221 today's the senate banking committee hearing
###223 proclaim that nobody believes that bank books
###227 are honest is just plain wrong
###229 perhaps someone on a reminder senator that the campaign is over
###233 and she should act accordingly
###235 if she wants to be taken to
###237 venue of civil right for bring that quote back
###240 right there and not shows the expectation in washington
###245 you run progressive during the campaign ofcourse we understand your trick people
###249 into getting their votes
###251 almost elections over if you want to be taken seriously
###255 you come back into the fold and you do with the corporations the banks wanted
###259 yet because what is being taken seriously
###262 has to be taken seriously meanest
###264 you want us to support
###266 you are still close some of our money to you you want us to you want to be in the
###270 crowd that were or
###271 and or worst or we have a target
###274 natalie attorneys try to get you out
###276 three days a civilization she definitely being taken seriously by
###281 that's right
###281 yet that's that's why people lover right
###284 and and what he's also saying anticipating plus a part of washington
###287 is
###288 that you're in that committee
###290 would you like to be the head of activity
###292 now understand that you go along being unserious like this you have no chance
###295 of being evacuated
###297 now the house is it
###298 the greatest example this was the house ways and means committee at that
###302 one point the democrat intro to the steps down
###305 uh... was charlie rangel exceed the september's revelations an excellent
###308 seniority was pete stark possibly the most progressive member of the house
###312 carefully right
###314 and that was you know the couple years ago
###316 and i said others know where they're going to make peace smart the head of
###319 the most powerful committee in the house be stars a relevent
###322 he lasted
###323 one day
###325 literally one day
###327 and he was made to step down
###329 give uh... it's a i'm not right for this role
###332 and it'd this place was put someone friendly the corporate interests so
###337 that's what they mean by you want to be taken seriously are you wanna be like he
###340 starts on a serious very soon
###342 but what is the level last even if it is absolutely his job
###346 under seniority rules under every rule lonely less one day
###350 and now for most senators on friday that the committee on
###353 cut back the powerful and by the way also more donations cuz
###357 well doesn't have a committee is more donations
###359 more likely to get reelected as a but they don't know what it dealing with
###363 here are the rules of the bargains that damages ahead of activity
###366 if she's got a sellout
###367 to be the head of the committee what obama was elected in the senate two
###370 thousand four eight two thousand two thousand lives are in
###373 als with warren was
###375 uh... was elections just elected board
###379 so twenty two thousand four two thousand eight obama rent two thousand eight moon
###383 an experienced senator fourier sir and point sixty
###387 chiller for your sister
###388 well i'll tell you what every progress in the country would be
###392 just beside themselves in in excitement if that happens right
###396 and hillary clinton wouldn't talk about the liquid
###399 made wing blurry gasoline clinton
###403 happened five years ago six years ago
###405 because she was to establish
###407 so that when she got less establishment since then
###410 so well this is a possibility that we were wrong
###412 no no no no we don't act look i think him we were never on retroactive
###417 resentful about about that offers a resume or or the other although it won't
###421 be there but we will win by the wrong about who was more staff yeah jack
###425 genessee last right
###427 but that's it while lighthouses damning with faint
###430 free praised what one more from was with one of your christian identity massive
###434 has restricted the street freely skit
###437 pennies on the dollar
###438 in the settlement
###440 for having been the victims illegal activities or mistakes in the banks
###445 activities
###447 do you like the banks and inhuman el nino individual cases where the banks
###452 violated the law and you're not going to tell the homeland's or at least it's not
###456 clear yet whether not you're going to do that
###459 we have in their decision will bring some homeowners
###461 people want to know
###463 that they're regulators are watching l for the american public not the banks
###469 and the only way that we can evaluate whether or not you're doing your job
###473 is if you make some of this information publicly available
###477 so far you're not doing that
###480 and without transparency we can't have any confidence
###484 either in new york oversight
###486 or at the markets are functioning properly handle
###491 water looked like a pilot lecture i said what are we talking about why not
###496 it's interesting the use of the conference because she is the opposite
###499 of all bombing how she's handled the first time
###501 present no model went with the hillary clinton uh...
###505 it keep your head down
###506 don't ever do anything don't challenge a bush say things that i was like out can
###511 you believe that bush is so bad let's get changed but don't introduce any
###514 legislation don't you know don't speak out in committee hearings shot up bright
###519 and it didn't work for you know right or wrong to work for
###522 he say
###523 issues now wild sheep i mean it's a pretty good i mean she's so let me know
###527 if you don't know threat over the world right itself but on it
###532 in terms of what she serious or not place she says because
###535 she does not go wade into territory
###538 but she's not
###539 totally well person so she's not going into other committees like guns blazing
###544 its acrobat botswana for back pain
###547 scene no was this
###549 and nobody knows a better than her and she if she knows it she's missing of
###552 course and stick my head up
###554 that's why i got elected the whole point was to represent people
###557 and about let him get away with it
###559 so she's gone with that strategy and and i think that it's obviously having serai
###563 strategy
###564 and obviously as you point out
###566 four years is not too short a period of time
###569 so up it out
