###17 Now you've got your ConDemNation ...

###36 Well, for fuck's sake,

###130 Your prescription.
###131 Oh, no, you don't understand, doctor.
###133 The dole sent me down here.
###135 You have to go through the motions, or they dock your benefit.
###137 I'm not a doctor, and you need glasses.
###141 That's... not... possible.
###146 It's fact.
###147 I'm not of the four-eyed persuasion. I'm strong. Me against...
###153 I've got the constitution of an ox.
###155 An ox that needs glasses.
###157 There's fuck-all wrong with my eyes, so get serious.
###160 Put your breasts away and look again with your little torch,

###205 (CLEARS THROAT)
###208 LAUGHTER
###213 Ha, ha, ha.
###215 Very fucking funny.
###217 How can a piss-stained tramp like you be too vain to wear glasses?
###221 It's not vanity.
###222 Yeah, and a wash wouldn't go amiss!
###223 Fuck off, you chimp!
###229 All right, knock it on the head.
###231 Come on, we're only having a joke.
###233 Fuck off!
###234 Ooh, have we hurt your feelings?
###241 How was the graduation?
###244 Brilliant ceremony. All dresses and gowns
###247 and hats like the Royal Wedding,
###249 but without the inbreeding.
###257 Magical, pregnancy. It's brilliant.
###260 Oh, it's a hoot.
###261 Do you mind if I have a little rub?
###264 Fire in, everyone else does.
###271 Good to have a graduate in the family. White collar worker, respectable.
###276 Is that what it's about, respectability?
###278 You're asking the wrong person.
###280 You dirty bastard!
###287 I hope he appreciates all this effort.
###291 Buzzin'. Best day of my life.
###295 Got to go.
###297 Come on, stay for another drink.
###298 Yeah, don't go!

###302 Yeah, my mates.

###321 I graduated. I'm a qualified teacher.
###323 Mammoth.
###325 Mates? Fuck it, they can wait an hour.
###330 CHEERING
###332 Cheers, everyone!
###334 Here's to the class of 2012.
###345 You all right, love?
###347 Yeah. Must have got caught up with his classmates.
###350 Did you tell him you were planning a do?
###353 Thought he'd pick up on my hints. Clearly not.
###358 His phone goes straight to voicemail.
###361 Poor cow's in denial.
###363 What of?
###364 That her man's an arsehole. Thank fuck we're normal, son, eh?
###371 For fuck's sake,
###372 look in the mirror before you come out the toilet, will you?
###384 Sorry.
###386 Sorry.
###397 How about some porky pig?
###403 Oh, vanity, thy name is salmonella.
###406 Jesus Christ! What the fuck, Nosferatu?
###411 If you're trawling the night for the blood of virgins,
###413 you'll have a long wait round here.
###415 I have the sweats, and you're lucky I do. If you could read,
###418 you'd see that meat's not fit for human consumption.
###420 I was saving it for theducks.
###423 Ducks can't eat bacon.
###424 Tell me something I don't know.
###427 And aren't you a bit past your own sell-by
###429 to be self-conscious about wearing glasses?
###432 I am not self-conscious.
###434 Bollocks. You're like a teenager who's been told not to pop his zits.
###439 We do have mirrors.
###440 I am aware that energy expended on vanity's largely wasted on my part,
###444 kind though it is of you to point it out.
###447 So, what?
###452 I cannot be weak.
###454 I know what they think round here.
###457 You've seen how they treat me. Laugh, point, kick, rob.
###460 Not many tears shed when I fell in the Jockey, was there?
###464 Sticks and stones.
###465 It's only because I have this, yeah? This.
###472 Faculties. Senses, head, body.
###478 If I'm strong, they can do whatever they like,
###481 but they cannot penetrate.
###482 I am immune.
###484 And wearing glasses fractures your superhero defences?
###489 Spectacles, hearing aids, walking sticks, prosthetic limbs. These...
###495 these...
###498 place me on a very slippery slope.
###503 If I am weak...
###505 I will not survive.
###510 Yeah, we open at seven. Doesn't mean I want to be out of my pit at seven.
###533 What time do you have, Feeney?
###534 Just gone half past the hour, Miss.
###536 Begin.
###544 Right, lads, not much time. You know the drill. You, number 10. You, 11.
###558 Remember, be firm. Get straight to the point.
###560 Leave them in no doubt. They'll be glad of it.
###564 God in heaven, you'll have the thing off its hinges!
###567 Don't open the door at this time of the morning, it can only be...
###570 Operation New Start.
###573 DSS Gestapo.
###576 These are court-signed documents ordering you
###578 to vacate these premises with immediate effect.
###581 You're being evicted.
###587 All right, all right! Keep your hair on...
###590 so I can scalp you when I open the fucking door.
###594 Can we come in?
###595 No. It's not even nine yet. What's going on?
###596 We've been evicted.
###598 Who has?
###599 All of us.
###611 Now, they can't search the house.
###613 We've still got some human rights left
###615 in this fucking dictatorship of the moderate.
###617 So we don't need to flush the drugs, then?
###619 No, we're safe... what drugs?
###622 You stupid...
###624 If the place wasn't swarming with suits, I'd strip-search you,
###628 you little bastard.
###629 What are you doing?
###630 Make noise, move about. Be several children.
###635 Keep the noise down, will you?
###638 We've got guests. Bloody 'ell, kids.
###640 Mayhem up there.
###641 Oh, hello.
###645 He still doesn't get it, Miss.
###649 Stop calling me "Miss".
###651 It's creepy, like I invented you in a fucking lab.
###654 Sorry, Mi...
###656 So... Aidan Croker,
###658 14, should be upstairs.
###662 And this little angel should be Stella.
###664 Are you enjoying your... your breakfast?
###668 Prawn Cocktail. Loves her seafood, so she does.
###671 Right, so no other children, is that correct?
###675 Or are you suggesting there are some more up there?
###677 THUDDING UPSTAIRS
###680 Yeah, just the one. But he puts himself about a bit.
###683 This is a multi-agency operation, Mr Gallagher.
###687 Department of Work and Pensions, local council,
###691 HMRC, environmental health, the police.
###698 That's not fair!
###699 In the past, people have relied on the left hand not knowing
###702 what the right hand is doing. Not any more.
###704 You can't put people out on the street. A child, a cripple.
###707 A geriatric fucking cripple.
###710 No, it's a broad remit. Premises inspection,
###712 checking that claimants are getting all they're entitled to...
###716 Or not.
###718 And in some very extreme cases, I am sorry to say,
###721 the serving of eviction papers to those individuals who have
###724 repeatedly ignored the wishes of the court.
###727 What court?
###728 "Gallagher, Vernon Francis,
###731 "has failed to answer a variety of charges
###733 "relating to benefit and council tax fraud, amongst other things."
###737 Well, nobody told me.
###748 We have to look at this as an opportunity.
###751 It frees you from that cycle of debt and dependency,
###755 free to pursue a new start.
###769 Temporary accommodation for you and the boy. Make sure and call ahead.
###774 St Helens?!
###775 Do you get that sense of freedom...
###778 being evicted so you can go forth and fulfil your potential?
###789 See it as an opportunity to give up the fags for good. Change your life!
###793 Fuck off, you bastard. Look what you've done to me
###797 I'll never fit any of my clothes again.
###799 In the delivery room, I want you there,
###801 with an extra-strength filter tipped and a Zippo, ready to go.
###804 I don't care whether they've snipped the umbilical or not!
###808 Grub up.
###809 All nice and healthy for the baby.
###820 Cosy!
###823 How's the flat hunt going, Micky?
###825 Oh, I've not started yet, y'know, been a bit busy.
###828 Life just takes over, doesn't?
###830 You know what they say, two's company.
###833 Four's a party.
###835 I can't believe I'm going to be called "Uncle Micky" again.
###837 Not... by blood.
###839 No, but we're roomies, so she can call me that if she wants.
###844 I just called her "She"!
###848 Just gonna have a dump,
###849 kick me mates out the spare room.
###853 We have got to get him out of this fucking house.
###856 He won't take the hint.
###859 Maybe we could move.
###867 I better get going.
###871 What you flogging today?
###874 DVDs, bit of weed, fags,
###877 homebrew, viagra, toastie makers...
###883 they can't get enough of the fucking toastie makers.
###887 OMG, come and have a look at this Kel it's absolutely enormous!
###899 What time is it?
###901 Something's up,
###904 people running about all over the place.
###906 When did I get in?
###908 About four.
###909 I got caught up, I'm sorry.
###911 Tomorrow's chip paper.
###914 I'm off, you better think about how you're going to make this up to me.
###918 You're totally up shit creek.
###930 Enough!
###933 You're like a herd of geese, squawk, squawk, squawk!
###938 Gaggle.
###940 What?
###941 S'not a "herd of geese", it's a "gaggle of geese".
###948 You wouldn't say "a flock of dogs", would you?
###951 Half six this morning bailiffs turned up.
###954 DWP, who's that, what's it stand for?
###956 LOUD CHATTING
###959 Any idea what they're going on about?
###963 Don't know, don't care.
###965 Can't hang around here, tell you that for no charge.
###968 Where else are they supposed to go?
###973 Fine, I'll go and see what's going on.
###993 I presume there's a story here.
###997 Good night, was it?
###999 Yeah.
###1001 Your missus put on a decent spread, it's a pity you missed it.
###1005 She's a good woman, don't fuck it up, I speak from experience.
###1009 I'll make it up to her. What's going on?
###1012 Uh, arresting folk for false claims.
###1013 Half the estate'll be in jail.
###1016 I think that's the plan.
###1017 Well, you know, if you can't do the time, eh?
###1020 POLICE SIRENS
###1021 Dick.
###1028 What's the story, Ches?
###1030 Don't know, stormtroopers, occupied territory.
###1043 Step back, please.
###1044 I'm a local business owner... got a couple of questions.
###1047 Let her through.
###1053 Can I ask what's going on?
###1055 You are...?
###1056 Karen Maguire I run a pub just up the road.
###1060 You are?
###1060 Oh, I'm so sorry, Carmen Kenaway, Care Kenaway Solutions.
###1063 I'm on secondment with Operation New Start.
###1066 You're evicting people?
###1068 We provide support to those who most need it.
###1070 So... you're not evicting people?
###1072 Those defrauding government agencies have all assistance suspended.
###1076 Including housing?
###1080 Karen leave it.
###1080 What?
###1081 We've got licenses to protect.
###1085 Don't open the door, Benny. Don't open the door!
###1089 If you don't let them in, they can't force entry...
###1097 Two streets so far, seven families.
###1101 It's got fuck all to do with us,
###1103 the last thing we need is to draw attention.
###1105 They can't just evict people.
###1106 Pint, please.
###1108 Splitting families up, temporary accommodation,
###1110 hostels, shelters all over the North West.
###1112 Wigan, St. Helens, Liverpool...
###1115 That's worse than being homeless.
###1117 Any chance of some fucking service, down here?
###1119 These families are in proper trouble.
###1122 Everybody's got a sob story,
###1124 so forgive me if I can't get worked up about it.
###1126 I've got problems of my own,
###1128 like where I'm going to house my dependents.
###1129 Don't be stupid, we've put Patty in our spare room.
###1132 I've got Aidan at ours.
###1133 And we've got Stella.
###1141 Well, don't all rush at once.
###1143 Maybe if you weren't such a...
###1144 I scrub up!
###1145 A cunt, I think she was going to say.
###1147 You can't wash that off.
###1149 Well, fuck the lot of you.
###1158 Hello, officer.
###1160 I heard you were coming back. Well, good luck.
###1163 They're not gonna make it easy.
###1165 So, what's happened?
###1167 No one told you? You've been evicted Carl.
###1172 Patty's bunking at ours,
###1174 Aidan and Stella are staying at the Maguire's, so everyone's safe.
###1177 And dad?
###1179 I'm sure we can make space for you.
###1181 I'm OK, thanks.
###1183 I'll sort something.
###1184 We'll have few drinks later, celebrate you being back?
###1209 Oh, the prodigal Pig returns.
###1214 You let us get evicted?
###1215 Move along you're not fit company.
###1218 Oh, so, this is the plan?
###1220 Live rough, sup the breakfast of champions?
###1226 How could you do this to me?
###1227 To you?!
###1228 Yes, to me, remember, the one who brought you up.
###1233 Fucking shame of it what have I done to deserve this?
###1237 It's a good job.
###1238 You're a police officer.
###1240 Fucking hell!
###1242 Yeah, fucking hell, yeah! One of them.
###1245 Yeah, I am.
###1247 Job, pension, purpose.
###1252 You're no son of mine.
###1257 Oh, I'm devastated.
###1265 Has he joined the coppers?
###1267 Ah, I don't know.
###1277 Hello, hello, hello.
###1280 Y'all right? Thought I might get a bite to eat.
###1283 Where've you been haven't seen you in ages?
###1285 Doing my training.
###1287 You know that I've joined the...?
###1290 You bastard.
###1291 Welcome back, mate.
###1292 Besides not like they brainwashed you is it?
###1295 You're still one of us.
###1297 Yeah, course.
###1299 Look at you, all grown up!
###1301 Where's the handcuffs and the truncheon?
###1305 Don't graduate till next week, get all the gear then.
###1308 I'm hoping they'll let me bring a taser home.
###1311 Where are you crashing?
###1314 Don't know yet... just saw my Dad...
###1317 Stay with us the more the merrier at the minute.
###1320 You sure?
###1321 Yeah, course.
###1322 C'mon, grab a box while you're at it.
###1324 Don't worry about that, mate, on you go.
###1348 Jesus Christ!
###1350 How long FERRET have you been stood there for?
###1352 Long enough to know you're a fucking weirdo.
###1355 Pot, kettle CUNT black.
###1358 I don't like you being here you should go.
###1361 I've got a message.
###1362 Like Jesus?
###1363 What?
###1364 Derren Brown? Magdalene?
###1365 No, fuckwit, for you.
###1372 And my ex.
###1375 Should I write it down?
###1377 You've got a babby coming, and I know how much she wants that.
###1382 And, it's not the babby's fault she's the spawn of a mental midget.
###1389 You said 'she'.
###1390 Yes I did, didn't I?
###1393 For what it's worth, I don't wish you harm.
###1397 There'll be no trouble from me.
###1403 You're losing the circulation to your hand.
###1406 Thank you. JAFFA!
###1418 Choccy's too big! You might have to open the door.
###1422 Can you do that?
###1423 Oh! Wait a minute I might have found another one.
###1432 There's more than one way to skin a cat, Feeney,
###1436 little bit of initiative.
###1443 Hey, you're doing a good job.
###1446 Time someone took this place to task.
###1448 And, er, what's your name?
###1450 Jackson Powell. Jackson Powell...
###1454 What is it, Miss, what is it?
###1457 Oh, you dirty bastard!
###1459 Get up, get up!
###1461 Isn't that the person we saw this morning?
###1463 I think it is, Miss, yes. Get Up!
###1466 Feeney, Feeney, wait.
###1468 This is an opportunity.
###1478 I mean, look at 'im. How long's old Malky lived 'ere?
###1481 Don't remember a time when he didn't.
###1482 And have you ever seen him put his hand in his pocket?
###1486 Not once, the tight-fisted fucker!
###1489 He's been nursing that for four hours. RIGHT!
###1492 Time to get a shift on! Hooverville won't build itself, y'know?
###1495 What you doing?
###1496 They're getting a bit cosy.
###1498 I told them they could crash 'ere!
###1499 Well, that can't be legal. So un-tell them.
###1502 Tweet me, and complain.
###1506 Like me Uncle Terry, that.
###1507 This one time, he beat the living shit out of my Aunty Sheila.
###1510 Did she deserve it?
###1511 What?
###1512 Did she deserve the beating?
###1515 I don't know, I was only little. Anyway that's not the story... Argh!
###1519 She didn't deserve it, because hitting a woman
###1521 isneveracceptable, understand?
###1524 This is an important lesson for you, since you've married our Mam.
###1528 I understand! I do!
###1530 Give it a proper wash!
###1533 Hey!
###1534 Got a few kegs I need to shift up from the cellar.
###1537 Give us a hand? Earn your keep while you're 'ere.
###1539 Yeah, no probs.
###1544 What was that for?
###1545 You've made summat of yourself.
###1547 And you don't let anybody fuck it up for you.
###1559 So...
###1561 How are we gonna make this work, then?
###1564 How d'you mean?
###1565 Monthly retainer.
###1568 Little bit extra if we need something more specific.
###1571 Fuck off! I'm a probationer for two years!
###1574 I'll be mainly making cuppas and having the piss taken out of me.
###1578 Yeah, well, call it a long-term investment, then.
###1580 You'll be able to buy yourself a nice little runaround before long.
###1585 Look, I'll never land you in it, J. You know that.
###1589 But I'll always be me own man.
###1591 We can't talk about this again.
###1597 Besides, half of these are doubled-up, you tight bastard!
###1600 Yeah, couldn't get to the fucking bank before it shut,
###1602 could I?
###1604 So what we shifting?
###1604 These big bastards over 'ere.
###1612 Hey, they don't skimp on expenses for the corporate raiders, d'they?
###1617 I won't lie to you. So you feeling better?
###1621 What? I regard you bringing me here as a hostile action.
###1624 You were destitute! You ungrateful pig.
###1625 Temporarily, I think you'll find!
###1628 Daniella! Please excuse Mrs Feeney. We're a very close team,
###1631 and she's naturally protective.
###1633 "Mrs?" Really? Somebody need a passport?
###1637 Er, would you leave us, please?
###1641 So, Frank, I am curious.
###1646 Were there no family that could take you in? No friends?
###1650 Social evolution in practice.
###1652 What?
###1654 I wear glasses.
###1655 Right?
###1659 These. Slippery slope.
###1661 Galapagos Islands round our way. If you're weak, you'll be savaged.
###1665 If I am fucking, this, man!
###1668 Cunts in this place will eat me alive, without a second thought.
###1672 Thanks to you lot!
###1673 My lot?
###1674 Oh, come on, don't pretend you're "Of the people."
###1678 Your fucking shoes alone would buy a three-bed semi in my street(!)
###1683 Come on! People are, y'know,
###1685 they're tired of this "them and us" mentality, aren't they?
###1689 Always seems to be the Old Etonians
###1693 telling the rest we live in a classless society
###1697 as they pass laws to deregulate around their investments.
###1700 The old divides don't apply.
###1703 It's about survival, nowadays.
###1706 Hey, your neighbours weren't slow to cast you out, hmm?
###1709 D'you think they're worried about what's become of you now?
###1712 I suspect not.
###1713 We want the same thing.
###1716 You scratch my back...
###1718 Oh, God!
###1722 Well, I wondered when this was coming up.
###1726 OK.
###1727 No more free lunches, eh?
###1733 Oh! I was thinking more...
###1737 information, and less...
###1740 penis.
###1746 Derek Molinari.
###1749 What a fucking chancer!
###1752 Punches in for his shift at Meinhoffer's.
###1756 Ching!
###1757 And then heads out to the bookies all day,
###1762 only stepping out to sign-on every Thursday.
###1768 Bet he's not the worst!
###1770 Oh, not by a long shot!
###1774 I tell you who's a lying twat! He never shares his smokes.
###1779 Biscuit-arse Pettigrew.
###1782 Ronnie, to his mother.
###1785 Apart from 'aving BO that could fell a fucking buffalo at 20 paces,
###1791 he's claiming on four different addresses.
###1797 And does he share the goodies around?
###1799 Did Jesus have a rubber cross?
###1807 Thought I was going to run out of tape.
###1810 Would you like me to have your room cleared?
###1812 That's not my room! Ooh, I wouldn't let that stench
###1815 anywhere near the place where I lay my head.
###1818 No, I'm over here.
###1819 OK, would you like a wake-up call, Miss? I could bring you a coffee?
###1830 (If you were mine,
###1833 (I'd have a cast made of your magnificent breasts,
###1837 (and this tongue would probe
###1843 (and plunge deep... )
###1847 Front-bottom, not back...
###1851 Did you say something?
###1853 No, Miss, I was just thinking, erm...
###1855 Night, Feeney.
###1856 Good night, Miss.
###1863 DOG BARKING
###1865 What the fuck?
###1868 Argh, I don't carry cash!
###1869 Me arse isn't clean!
###1873 (MICKY LAUGHS LOUDLY)
###1877 Go on!
###1878 TELEVISION BLARES
###1880 Yes, Kelly?
###1882 (VOICE ON TELEVISION) All you're planning to do is sit back
###1885 and carry on selling 100 quid's worth of weed a week!
###1888 Micky, d'you mind? Can't be doing with telly first thing.
###1892 Oh, it's brilliant, this one! They get the DNA and they find out...
###1896 There's no fucking milk!
###1898 Marty's got something to ask you.
###1901 Well, see, I...
###1901 You need to move out.
###1905 What?
###1906 We're nesting.
###1907 We need room for the baby, mate.
###1912 But I was gonna help you, you know.
###1914 Like the Three Musketeers.
###1916 No, we're like the two musketeers, and you're like a bloke
###1919 who insists on crashing with us, and won't take a fucking hint!
###1923 You've been hinting?
###1925 In neon, with megaphones! Had a biplane fly past the other day,
###1928 trailing a banner. "Micky, have the sense you were born with
###1931 "and get the fuck out."
###1932 You're a brilliant flatmate...
###1934 No, you're right. Your needs are greater.
###1941 Don't be like that!
###1942 I'll be gone in an hour.
###1946 Think you were direct enough?
###1952 Why can't you crash in the dormobile?
###1955 Oh, I don't get the keys for that! They know I'd sell the rust bucket!
###1959 Don't wash your gonads in the sink! Other people have to brush
###1962 their teeth there!
###1963 Where you gonna kip tonight?
###1964 Wherever I lay my hat, son.
###1967 I was born under a wandering star.
###1970 I need no man. I am a rock.
###1973 A rock? Frank, you're washing yourself in me brother's gaffe,
###1976 and rolling on deodorant supplied by the bollock-washer!
###1981 Trust me, it's every man for himself.
###1983 Only the strongest will survive.
###1987 Don't... Don't do that.
###1991 CHATTERING
###1994 Keep your strength! All for one, one for all.
###1997 You don't fool me for a fucking minute!
###2009 All right, Shane, what's the abuse today?
###2012 Go on! Do your worst, I'm a big boy.
###2019 You all right?
###2024 I got you something.
###2035 What am I looking at?
###2037 All of 'em! Any one you like. Might as well aim high.
###2041 Time to move on.
###2043 Finally!
###2045 What if I don't want to? I like it here.
###2048 It's what we always said we'd do, when I graduated.
###2055 I think we were wrong to want that.
###2059 I think we're right.
###2061 Mate, you need to make the most of it while you can.
###2065 Random drugs tests and all that.
###2067 Fuck off!
###2070 Besides, I don't think I can go through with it.
###2074 What?
###2075 Passing out ceremony.
###2077 So you did all the training, but you're not gonna graduate?
###2082 What's the point in that?
###2083 I can't, not...
###2084 Not without me Dad's blessing.
###2087 Fuck your Dad!
###2089 If I go, who's gonna look after 'im?
###2091 Look, he's a survivor.
###2092 If there's no-one there to protect him from himself,
###2095 he'll be dead within 18 month.
###2098 I can't do that to him.
###2101 I can't let him cut me off.
###2105 DOOR BANGS
###2113 Miss, no-one's answering their doors!
###2118 DOOR SLAMS
###2122 I haven't the patience for this. Call a town meeting.
###2126 Put our cards on the table.
###2128 Are you sure?
###2130 What we're doing is for the good of these people.
###2133 It's time they understood that.
###2137 That's 75% of benefit claims in this area are fraudulent...
###2143 They're not fraudulent, they're rejected. There's a difference.
###2147 Parliamentary procedure!
###2149 Miss Kenaway has the floor.
###2151 If you want to make an interjection, approach the
###2154 microphone and the chair will recognise you.
###2160 You heard me.
###2161 MURMURS OF AGREEMENT
###2163 The thing is, you have got to pay your way and, more importantly...
###2167 Don't lose your head.
###2168 This matters to me.
###2170 Why?
###2171 Because if I fuck them, I fuck myself.
###2173 I don't buy into all this nobility bollocks.
###2176 Yeah, you do. You can't fool me.
###2180 I know you.
###2182 But we can't go on like this.
###2184 Less than 15% of residents pay any council tax at all.
###2189 No wonder! Order!
###2190 Why...
###2193 Why should anyone pay council tax round here?
###2197 The state of the roads!
###2199 Half the streetlights haven't worked in a year.
###2201 APPLAUSE AND MURMURS OF AGREEMENT
###2204 You're making my point for me. The Chatsworth is a failed estate.
###2208 It might be a shithole, but it's our shithole!
###2211 No-one wants to move here. You can't expect the authorities
###2214 to keep on throwing good money after bad.
###2217 Invest.
###2219 CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
###2222 Right, OK, I know for a fact that someone in this room
###2226 works at the Meinhoff brewery, and is claiming disability benefit.
###2230 Someone else, lives in... Anchor Way,
###2233 is claiming on four separate addresses.
###2237 Swing a cat, and you'll hit half a dozen. That'snotthe point.
###2242 Order!
###2245 Well, what is the point?
###2248 I'm waiting.
###2252 Stop punishing people who can't defend themselves.
###2256 We're not punishing anyone.
###2257 Yeah, you are.
###2258 This places sticks in your craw
###2260 because we're a dent on the balance sheet.
###2263 And the fucking balance sheet is your god, correct?
###2266 CHEERING
###2268 This operation will continue whether you co-operate or not.
###2271 Fine.
###2274 Bring it on.
###2276 CHEERING AND APPLAUSE
###2280 You're barred!
###2281 Why do I get the feeling I've just been set up?
###2283 Because you have.
###2284 Told you I knew you.
###2286 You do realise we've just declared war?
###2300 Whatare you doing?
###2301 How d'you mean?
###2303 I told you that stuff in confidence.
###2304 You're the one who doesn't believe in society.
###2308 Doesn't mean I want to join in the goose-stepping!
###2310 Oh, this isn't about class.
###2313 We're not the SS.
###2315 It's about people getting away with it.
###2317 They bought shares in utilities, and satellite dishes
###2321 when the going was good.
###2323 They?
###2326 Who arethey?
###2329 They are the people who might be a little bit funny
###2332 if they knew that you and me had been chatting.
###2337 Keep your ears open, Frank. I want to know whattheyare doing.
###2347 Shit.
###2350 20 cigs. Come on.
###2351 No.
###2353 Why the fuck not?
###2354 Cos you're a tosser.
###2356 Serve him, Ches.
###2359 It's all right, forget it. I think I've just lost me craving.
###2362 You should be proud of Carl.
###2363 Proud? Proud?! Of that traitor?
###2366 Yeah!
###2367 Not the traitor bit, though.
###2368 What is your problem?
###2370 What, the truth? Yeah.
###2372 You are not like your brothers and sisters.
###2376 You are destined for far lesser things.
###2380 Cheeky bastard.
###2381 You were my one great hope.
###2384 The salvation of my loins.
###2386 We fuck up.
###2389 We turn the other cheek. We run away.
###2391 It's our DNA.
###2393 Rotten to the core. Like father like son.
###2396 I'm nothing like you.
###2398 Ohhh!
###2399 I'm not.
###2401 Ohhh!
###2403 What are you doing?
###2407 You're freaking me out, you tit.
###2408 This job won't last.
###2410 The real you's in there
###2412 fighting to get out.
###2415 And I am counting down the days...
###2425 Know what gets me, though?
###2427 Some fucker's grassing them up, passing on details, and that.
###2431 It's not right.
###2433 I fucking hate grasses.
###2435 Yeah, they know how to treat them in Iraq and Iran,
###2437 you know, in the Middle East.
###2439 Cut their heads off, man...
###2440 Wha-a-ahhh...
###2444 No messing about.
###2446 They decapitate you for shopping someone?
###2448 Yeah! Big, curly sword. Wha-tcha!
###2452 They've got the right idea, mate.
###2453 Nah, nah, nah, nah.
###2455 The Irish, they had the right idea.
###2459 They tarred and feathered the informants, tied 'em to lampposts...
###2464 Come on! Please.
###2466 Could get hypothermia.
###2469 Fucking bird flu, maybe.
###2471 Fuck off!
###2472 Like turkeys at Christmas.
###2480 Morning.
###2482 Morning, sir.
###2483 CHEERING
###2488 Yeah, fuck off.
###2489 Our very own little Che Guevara!
###2491 Who's that?
###2492 - The one on the T-shirts. - Footballer?
###2495 Yeah.
###2497 What's your fucking hair like, today?
###2505 Where's Karen Maguire, please?
###2507 Kiss my dick.
###2508 Perhaps your mother has better manners.
###2510 I'll tear your fucking head off and shit in your neck.
###2513 I'm here.
###2515 Your licence to sell alcohol on these premises has suspended
###2518 pending investigation.
###2520 Investigation of what?
###2521 Several possible contraventions of the Licensing Act 2003,
###2525 including letting patrons spend the night at the location.
###2529 You don't have the right to serve these.
###2531 Oh, this is a multi-agency operation.
###2533 It's tobacco and alcohol too. It's across the board.
###2535 Fine! Go ahead, suspend the licence.
###2538 We'll give the drink away.
###2539 CHEERING What?!
###2540 We'll give it away. We can take the hit.
###2542 This place doesn't close. Ever. You won't starve us out.
###2548 I'll have a triple voddie, Rockefeller.
###2563 Could you help me out, please?
###2565 I've been in here since Tuesday.
###2572 Could you not put a little more on the deposit?
###2575 For an extra 2,000 you could get this one.
###2578 It has a downstairs toilet. Be perfect for me.
###2580 You?
###2581 You're going to have to get used to the idea
###2584 that this could be a permanent living arrangement.
###2587 You're welcome to stay until you sort out alternative accommodation,
###2590 but for the first time in my life, I could be approved for a mortgage
###2595 and it's for my family's future, only.
###2597 We may never get our house back.
###2597 KNOCKING AT DOOR
###2599 You wouldn't cast a destitute pensioner out onto the streets?
###2603 If I had to, yeah.
###2607 Jackson Powell?
###2608 Yeah?
###2609 We're from Operation New Start.
###2613 You claimed income support whilst under going teacher training.
###2618 Yes, yes, but that's...
###2619 You also received a maintenance grant to the sum of £2,906.
###2624 No, no. It's not... You don't under...
###2626 and a teacher trainee bursary to the sum of £6,000.
###2629 You can't expect a man who has family to provide for
###2631 to live off that alone.
###2632 On family tax credits
###2636 over a period of four years.
###2643 You're not listening to me. My family need it.
###2647 Every penny goes on our survival! I'm like you.
###2650 An honest working man.
###2665 That's the last of it.
###2670 Micky...
###2672 I'm... sorry... We owe you big time.
###2676 If circumstances were different, we'd love you to stay...
###2678 I could babysit...
###2680 No, get the fuck out! Get a fucking life!
###2685 Don't have to tell me twice.
###2688 Oh, you going somewhere?
###2690 I'm moving out.
###2692 You all are. Council-sponsored court-sanctioned eviction order.
###2698 (CHUCKLES)
###2701 I'm being prosecuted. Can you believe that?
###2704 He invited them in, made them a cup tea,
###2707 which, by the way, I've noticed neither has touched,
###2710 and offered a light snack for the privilege.
###2712 They've made a mistake. We're not dole scroungers.
###2715 There's no point. I'm signing off, anyway.
###2717 I'm a qualified teacher now.
###2718 I've got a post at St Morrissey's...
###2720 My husband has no comment. Both of you,
###2724 out of my fucking house now.
###2727 Not another word!
###2736 We'll be in touch.
###2740 Did you see the way he just looked at me?
###2743 Like they would Frank Gallagher! How fucking dare they? I'll fix this.
###2747 That's fine, then, isn't it?
###2749 Just in case, put this pot away somewhere safe.
###2754 Cos after that lot get through with us, at
###2756 least we'll have something left to piss in.
###2758 Pasta do you for lunch?
###2759 Oh, I can't stand feckin' Italian food...
###2761 Pasta would be lovely.
###2768 Four quid! Come on! Can't sell them in the shop.
###2773 Look at 'em all. What have we done?
###2777 Come on, boys! Get your pennies out!
###2779 CHEERING
###2780 God knows.
###2782 Pint and an orange.
###2786 Put a large voddie in it.
###2787 Bairn's got to get used to it sometime.
###2795 Go on, what you having?
###2797 No, you're all right, thanks, I'm fine.
###2799 SILENCE FALLS
###2802 CLANGING
###2807 For fuck's sake, is it panto season(?)
###2810 What have you done, Frank?
###2812 Nothing. I've just... had me fill, that's all.
###2815 Frank?
###2815 I haven't done anything!
###2818 You're refusing a free drink?
###2820 I'm not... I'm just...
###2822 He's got a guilty conscience.
###2824 About what? You threw me out.
###2827 He's lying! Can't even look me in the eye.
###2828 (SIGHS)
###2830 Swear on the kids' lives.
###2831 I swear.
###2833 Swear on Man City.
###2834 I swear.
###2835 On your mother's memory.
###2839 MURMURING
###2841 Grass!
###2842 She's got us over a barrel. If I don't...
###2844 Fucking hell!
###2846 No, listen! If I don't weigh her in with info,
###2848 she's going to fucking hang me out to dry.
###2850 MURMURING
###2853 Well, come on, then!
###2855 Come on!
###2856 JEERING
###2857 Bring it on, you pack of hyenas!
###2860 Got fuck all to lose, anyway! Come on!
###2865 I'm just a fucking punchbag, aren't I?
###2869 One man's torture is another man's justified measures.
###2872 I mean, I don't know if I believe in punishment for it's own sake.
###2875 I'm more a rehabilitation man myself.
###2877 I'd have no conscience about it.
###2880 I want to see him suffer. Two-faced grassing bastard!
###2884 They might cut your knob off. You can still live knobless.
###2887 Always thought it'd cause you to bleed to death,
###2890 but apparently not.
###2892 You can't kill Frank. It'd be like drowning a puppy.
###2896 I've drowned loads of puppies.
###2898 Trust me, it's fuck-all like this.
###2900 Still carrying a torch for him, are we?
###2902 Yeah(!) I don't want him murdered, so I'm carrying a torch for him.
###2906 Is that your logic?
###2907 There's loads of people I don't want murdered,
###2910 so that must make me a right slapper(!)
###2912 'It does turn you into a soprano, though.'
###2914 You know, high voice and all that.
###2916 Sopranos used to be dead valuable in history.
###2920 When I say soprano, I do mean castrato, obviously.
###2923 MUFFLED CRIES
###2925 The Pope had a whole choir of them in the 16th century.
###2929 MUFFLED SHOUTING
###2932 Burn me, shoot me, drown me at sea! I don't care what you do,
###2937 but stop fucking talking!
###2940 Punishing him for its own sake makes no sense. How does it benefit us?
###2944 It isn't supposed to benefit us.
###2946 Maybe it is.
###2949 Look, he spied for them, yeah? Why can't he spy for us?
###2951 Find out what they're up to, bring it here?
###2954 And maybe pass on some duff information to them,
###2957 while he's at it?
###2958 What, Frank Gallagher ... double agent?!
###2961 Fuck me, we must be desperate!
###2968 Look out, Mata Hari's on the case
###2969 Oh, ha-fucking-ha(!) I don't have to do this.
###2973 Shouldn't have blabbed your fucking mouth off in the first place!
###2976 You owe us, all of us. Big time.
###2980 I know... that!
###2982 That's why I'm trying to put things right, aren't I?
###2986 Finding out what they're up to so you...
###2990 wehave got a fighting chance of stopping them.
###2992 Good luck.
###3004 Big, big, big plans.
###3008 Hm, pray tell.
###3009 It's bribery.
###3010 Need to keep a close eye on your team.
###3014 Someone on the inside's passing info in exchange for readies.
###3016 Get Frank another drink, yeah?
###3019 I think it helps him to talk more... freely.
###3022 (LAUGHS) OK.
###3024 So Frank, what sort of information are they supplying exactly?
###3028 It's like addresses of where you're going to swoop next.
###3032 When are you swooping?
###3034 You know, matter of interest?
###3037 Carmen! Carmen!
###3040 I couldn't find you!
###3044 I have no sympathy or time for this.
###3046 I love you!
###3047 I used to be at your beck and call...
###3051 Oh, great(!)
###3054 Carmen may be some time.
###3056 Ah. I'm in no rush.
###3060 All right, love. Your virtue's safe with me. I may need glasses,
###3065 but I'm not totally Stevie Wonder.
###3071 (SLURRED) Where the fuck has Carmen got to?
###3074 We won't see her now.
###3076 This always happens when he shows up
###3079 and she falls for it every time.
###3082 Husband. Going through a divorce.
###3086 He's a drunk, a womaniser.
###3090 He'll have had his way with her
###3092 and then run back to the younger model.
###3094 Men are bastards!
###3097 Do you have a little lady crush?
###3101 Hm?
###3106 I, er... I touched her boob once,
###3109 while she was asleep. The left one.
###3113 I just... brushed my palm
###3117 across her nipple.
###3122 I sleep on it now.
###3124 Hard to tell, cos I'm so pissed, but...
###3128 I might've just come in me pants.
###3132 You're all stuffed, though. You know that.
###3135 What?
###3136 It's political, like immigration
###3140 No government can be seen
###3143 to be supporting benefits.
###3146 The underbelly is a cancer.
###3153 Shall we have another drink?
###3156 Oh, no!
###3157 Go on! You know you want to.
###3160 Ah, go on!
###3161 Oh, all right. Then we call it a day. I need to, er...
###3166 Leave the table here.
###3190 Where's Feeney?
###3191 GLASS CLINKING
###3196 What you doing?
###3197 I just... I...
###3199 I dropped me glasses.
###3203 You look shagged.
###3221 You going somewhere?
###3224 I don't know who you are anymore.
###3228 Oh, I'm going somewhere!
###3229 I don't want to be like everyone else!
###3231 I want two parents.
###3236 You're so keen to move on. I think you should.
###3239 You're not that stupid! 15 years of marriage?
###3242 15 years?
###3243 Letitia! I wouldn't want you looking down your nose at us.
###3247 Maybe one of your better class of mates can put you up.
###3250 In.
###3251 In!
###3254 I won't be blackmailed!
###3265 Not a fucking word!
###3277 There you go, love.
###3279 Cheers.
###3281 Oh, come on, I've earned it!
###3284 If I had my way, you'd be propping up a bridge somewhere by now.
###3289 Oh what, you going to stuff your gums with orange peel?
###3292 Tell me Luca Brazi sleeps with the fishes?
###3296 You don't scare me!
###3300 We're fucked!
###3301 They're going to evict as many as they can,
###3304 but there's no new tenants.
###3306 No-one's moving in. They're going to keep the houses empty, permanent.
###3310 Well, that's stupid.
###3311 No, that's clever. Left empty, the houses'll rot.
###3314 But then no-one'll want to live here.
###3316 Exactly what they want.
###3317 They're looking to shut down the whole estate.
###3320 No houses, no pub, no punters, no people.
###3323 This'll be one of those places people used to live.
###3326 Well, I for one am lying down to no bully.
###3329 I'm with you.
###3330 We need a plan.
###3334 I wear them for reading sometimes.
###3336 I wear contacts.
###3338 I need 'em for watching telly.
###3342 I don't need glasses.
###3343 I only wear them cos fellas can't resist the slutty secretary look.
###3349 How are we going to fight them? They've got cops and dogs.
###3352 They've got tasers.
###3353 We need to be smart. Guerrilla warfare.
###3356 Yeah, French resistance!
###3358 But... we're not French.
###3360 We're all in the same fucking boat.
###3364 (FRANK) 'All right, so maybe I was a bit premature.
###3367 'These are difficult days.
###3371 'You know, post banking crisis,
###3373 'post comprehensive spending review,
###3377 'cuts, cuts and more cuts.
###3380 'And kick the living shit out of the underbelly
###3385 'cos they're least equipped to defend themselves.
###3390 'The more things change,
###3393 'the more they stay the same, yeah?
###3411 'Society is dead.
###3414 'Long live society.'
###3418 Thanks to you, these people have lost their homes.
###3420 £150,000?!
###3421 That's her bonus, if she manages to permanently board up 120 houses.
###3425 Partner couldn't make it again?
###3426 'I can't do it on my own.'
###3428 I'll mess it up!
###3429 I'll mess it up! You will if you carry on ignoring your baby.
###3431 Upset by a couple of evictions, are you?
###3433 Ten years from now, this place will be wasteland!
###3436 She has destroyed people's lives. She's caused total mayhem!
###3440 You know what hormones are like? I really need to go and ride me boy.
###3444 Oh, baby!
