###4 CHARLET DUBOC: Welcome to "Fashion Week Internationale,"
###7 the show that reports on the most fabulous fashion weeks in
###10 the world, and the culture and politics behind them.
###14 This time, we take you down south to Atlanta, Georgia.
###17 
###25 -What a coincidence that you're here for Urban Fashion
###27 Week, and all I know is fashion.
###30 Every day I wake up it's like a fashion statement.
###33 I wear army fatigue pants.
###35 That's because I'm a soldier, you hear me?
###38 CHARLET DUBOC: When you say "soldier," I know you don't
###40 mean it in a military sense.
###41 You're not in the army, right?
###43 -It's not necessarily a war, like I'm
###45 going to kill somebody.
###47 But it's a war against trying to better myself every day.
###50 So at the end of the day, I'm struggling, and I'm fighting a
###53 war against my haters and my doubters, to show them that
###57 they ain't going to stop me, never.
###59 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###64 CHARLET DUBOC: In the last few years, the city of Atlanta has
###67 reinvented itself as one of the
###68 entertainment capitals of America.
###70 
###73 With massive home-grown artists such as Outkast,
###76 Ludacris, Waka Flocka Flame, and Gucci Mane, all paying
###80 homage to their city's inimitable southern charm and
###83 titillating nightlife.
###86 We had come here to meet a man called Billy Bad Ass as he
###89 prepared to bring his Urban Fashion Week franchise to
###93 London, bringing some Atlanta style to the
###96 prim English streets.
###97 
###104 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###107 CHARLET DUBOC: Billy had lined up a week of urban fashion
###110 delights in Atlanta, and I couldn't wait to live out my
###113 music video fantasies with Billy as my guide.
###118 We met Billy at a casting call to select some aspiring models
###121 to take to London, some of whom had flown in
###124 from as far as Kansas.
###128 Billy.
###128 BILLY BAD ASS: Yeah.
###129 CHARLET DUBOC: Thanks for having us.
###130 BILLY BAD ASS: You're right here at the spot.
###132 First time we've started out our interviews for the models.
###136 We're trying to select one model to go to London.
###138 So we getting it going.
###141 Let me tell you a little bit about what's going on.
###142 We're going to actually select probably one, or maybe two
###146 models, to go to London.
###148 We take care of your hotel, your partying.
###151 White party, black party, whatever parties you're going
###153 to have up there.
###155 You'll be able to eat for free and just kind of
###158 hang out, on me.
###161 CHARLET DUBOC: Before getting down to the casting process,
###164 Billy wanted to introduce me to some of
###165 his assembled entourage.
###168 He'd invited along the first and only black
###171 female NASCAR driver.
###173 BILLY BAD ASS: This is Tia.
###174 She's a NASCAR driver.
###176 I think she's going to be very instrumental in helping a lot
###180 of young ladies get out of the stereotype
###182 that they can't drive.
###185 CHARLET DUBOC: Then there was the African business investor.
###188 KENNY: What I love about him is his thinking and his
###190 innovative capability.
###192 He thinks of things outside of the box.
###194 BILLY BAD ASS: I'm actually trying to build
###196 my own fashion car.
###197 Body make, engine, tires, everything is fashion.
###203 And that's not being done yet.
###204 CHARLET DUBOC: And an environmental officer from Fox
###207 Entertainment.
###208 BILLY BAD ASS: I think urban and eco needs to get together.
###210 FELICIA PHILLIPS: That's exactly right.
###211 BILLY BAD ASS: I look like a fool, but I'm the only one in
###213 my neighborhood with the blue box out in front of my house
###215 on Fridays.
###216 I'm going to put my cool shades on.
###217 See, I'm fashion.
###219 I've got to get the Rick Ross going on, see.
###223 CHARLET DUBOC: Finally, he got round to directing a
###225 photoshoot.
###226 BILLY BAD ASS: I'm looking for a girl with a little bit more
###228 booty than a couture model, a little rump in the trunk.
###232 Mess with that hair.
###234 You've got it all out, now.
###235 You've got to let them see it.
###236 Throw a kiss.
###237 Throw a kiss.
###237 No, no, no.
###238 Throw a kiss like you would give your boyfriend.
###240 [LAUGHTER]
###241 BILLY BAD ASS: You're throwing me a kiss like you
###242 would give a wall.
###244 Come one, throw a kiss like you'd give
###245 your boyfriend a kiss.
###247 Be sincere with something like aaah.
###248 
###252 -That's how you kiss your boyfriend.
###254 CHARLET DUBOC: Then he got down to a Tyra Banks-style
###256 interview session.
###257 
###263 ARLENE: My name's Arlene White.
###265 I am born and raised here in Atlanta, Georgia.
###269 JANAE BROOKS: Janae Brooks, and I'm 19.
###271 STINA DIAS: Stina Dias.
###272 I'm from Kansas City as well.
###274 BILLY BAD ASS: What sign are you?
###275 -Capricorn.
###276 -I'm a Libra.
###277 -Water sign.
###277 JANAE BROOKS: I'm an Aries.
###279 STINA DIAS: Really?
###280 I am too!
###281 JANAE BROOKS: Really?
###281 STINA DIAS: Yeah.
###282 [GIGGLING]
###284 CHARLET DUBOC: And the questioning got
###285 increasingly awkward.
###287 BILLY BAD ASS: Let's say, for example, we're at a club, and
###289 we wanted to party, and you were ready to go, and we
###293 weren't ready to go.
###294 -Um.
###295 
###297 BILLY BAD ASS: What if you were waiting for your flight
###298 and you were waiting and you couldn't get on the flight,
###301 and you got bumped.
###301 What would you do?
###302 JANAE BROOKS: I don't really know.
###304 Um.
###305 
###308 I'm not sure, really.
###310 BILLY BAD ASS: There's a reason you're here.
###311 What reason should I bring you that you would stand out?
###315 What is it about you as a person that's going to make me
###318 want to bring you to London?
###319 What's in your heart?
###320 What's the passion you have that's going to make you do
###323 something in London?
###324 JANAE BROOKS: That I'm just really determined.
###327 It's pretty much my determination.
###331 Going for it, pretty much.
###335 He says the question, why should we pick you?
###340 Me, at the time, I was thinking, well, shoot, I don't
###343 really know.
###343 I'm just here.
###345 So he was like, well, I picked you because of something
###348 really deep down.
###350 Maybe I didn't know what the answer was, but he knew it was
###356 something else.
###358 I with I knew.
###359 STINA DIAS: And at the end of the day, we ended up spending
###361 close to $1,000 just to get down here.
###364 It's a lot of money.
###365 CHARLET DUBOC: And why is it worth that much money?
###369 STINA DIAS: It'll never come again.
###369 JANAE BROOKS: Nothing like this will ever come again.
###372 Just the fact that we came to Atlanta, a lot models in
###375 Kansas City have never even been out of the city, let
###379 alone out of the state.
###382 CHARLET DUBOC: I wasn't sure of the reason behind Billy's
###384 tough love approach, and wondered how much of this was
###387 for the benefit of the camera.
###390 BILLY BAD ASS: Sometimes people don't, they don't
###392 prepare themselves.
###393 Like, that girl came all the way from Kansas City.
###396 She could have practiced her photos, she could have
###398 practiced her attitude.
###400 In the next time, they're going to be a lot more
###402 prepared, especially if they're dealing with me.
###404 Because you don't know what you're going to get with me.
###406 I know a lot of people.
###409 I'm going out to Vegas and hanging out with
###411 Mayweather's people.
###412 Mayweather just got out of jail, but I'm friends with
###416 some of those people that he hangs out with.
###418 So I'm going out there, and they're going to show me a
###420 good time, and I'm going to be prepared for that.
###423 My gear's going to be right.
###425 My swag is going to be up.
###426 I'm going to be like, yeah, I can hang out with Mayweather,
###430 with his 30 cars.
###431 I can hang out with him.
###432 So that's what it's about.
###434 You've got to be prepared.
###434 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###437 CHARLET DUBOC: Billy had organized an afterparty of
###439 sorts at a club.
###442 However, only two of his friends and the lady NASCAR
###445 driver showed up.
###446 But Billy implored us to keep the camera rolling.
###450 So I sat and talked nicely with his friends about their
###452 cool idea for a zombie movie.
###455 This wasn't quite the Atlanta experience I'd imagined, but
###458 then it was only our first night.
###460
