1
0:1:13,95 --> 0:1:15,48
>> BOSS: Your hard drive is filthy.


2
0:1:15,48 --> 0:1:19,64
Right - we got your computer back. I mean, it is - it is -


3
0:1:19,64 --> 0:1:25,96
dirty. I'm talking like ho's, sluts, anal, double anal,
penetration, interracial facial, creampie -


4
0:1:25,96 --> 0:1:42,47
I don't even know what that is.


5
0:1:42,47 --> 0:1:46,12
>> ANNA DAVID: So we'll start first with the experts.


6
0:1:46,12 --> 0:1:49,54
What are some of the symptoms
of sex addiction?


7
0:1:49,54 --> 0:1:53,69
>> ALEXANDRA KATEHAKIS: Well the signs and the symptoms
and the consequences are all the same -


8
0:1:53,69 --> 0:1:57,8
the ones we saw there - high levels of
preoccupation are what people report. I mean, this is


9
0:1:57,8 --> 0:2:0,56
what takes up most of the time. It's not the
orgasm.


10
0:2:0,56 --> 0:2:2,94
It's the thinking about, it's the
ritualization,


11
0:2:2,94 --> 0:2:5,33
it's the preparation, it's the obsession.


12
0:2:5,33 --> 0:2:6,87
Loss of time, loss of


13
0:2:6,87 --> 0:2:7,93
friends.


14
0:2:7,93 --> 0:2:10,619
Loss of socialization.


15
0:2:10,619 --> 0:2:13,9
It's a disease of isolation


16
0:2:13,9 --> 0:2:15,18
whereby people spend all of their time,


17
0:2:15,18 --> 0:2:16,8
energy,


18
0:2:16,8 --> 0:2:19,669
either thinking about it, preparing for the
next sexual episode


19
0:2:19,669 --> 0:2:21,229
and as I said earlier they continue


20
0:2:21,229 --> 0:2:22,749
despite negative consequences,


21
0:2:22,749 --> 0:2:24,889
which we see in him.


22
0:2:24,889 --> 0:2:28,689
Even when he's confronted, he just looks
dead and dissociated,


23
0:2:28,689 --> 0:2:33,359
which is a large part of people that are
true sex addicts. There's a high level


24
0:2:33,359 --> 0:2:35,169
of compartmentalization


25
0:2:35,169 --> 0:2:39,859
and dissociation, so that relationships
fall away, anything that has any meaning


26
0:2:39,859 --> 0:2:42,359
to people, they start to jeopardize.


27
0:2:42,359 --> 0:2:45,249
And they can't NOT do it, as i think
what


28
0:2:45,249 --> 0:2:49,929
Carmen was saying also - that it led her to
thinking about killing herself.


29
0:2:49,929 --> 0:2:54,279
>> ANNA: And the thing you said before about how
he looks like he's in pain -


30
0:2:54,279 --> 0:2:57,229
>> ALEX: Yeah. Yeah, I mean that's what was so
disturbing to me when I saw this movie


31
0:2:57,229 --> 0:3:1,869
and why I liked the movie so much is
that they didn't glamorize that at all.


32
0:3:1,869 --> 0:3:5,0
>> ETHLIE ANN VARE: I call that his "Are we having fun yet?" face.


33
0:3:5,0 --> 0:3:6,519
>> ALEX: Yeah, exactly. And you see


34
0:3:6,519 --> 0:3:10,93
the tolerance that builds too. And there's
a big argument academically about


35
0:3:10,93 --> 0:3:11,73
whether


36
0:3:11,73 --> 0:3:14,38
there is, in fact, tolerance with this problem.


37
0:3:14,38 --> 0:3:18,96
And yet he keeps upping the ante where
he ends up having sex with men


38
0:3:18,96 --> 0:3:22,41
and we don't know that he's oriented towards men in the
beginning of the movie but it doesn't


39
0:3:22,41 --> 0:3:26,269
matter. He's just got to get out of this abject pain 
that he's in.


40
0:3:26,269 --> 0:3:31,249
>> ETHLIE: I think part of that in this instance is
his spiral toward self-destruction,


41
0:3:31,249 --> 0:3:37,129
his version of his sister's wrist slashing.
So it may not even be


42
0:3:37,129 --> 0:3:41,909
an escalation of a sexual need. I
sometimes liken sex addiction to


43
0:3:41,909 --> 0:3:46,389
nicotine addiction. No one is going to
debate whether or not nicotine


44
0:3:46,389 --> 0:3:51,27
cigarettes are addictive - an
addiction rather than a habit.


45
0:3:51,27 --> 0:3:59,89
But I personally managed to smoke a pack and a half a day for nineteen
years. I was addicted. It didn't escalate to four packs a day, I was


46
0:3:59,89 --> 0:4:5,849
still addicted. So I think it's possible to have an addiction without
the phenomenon of increasing tolerance.


47
0:4:5,849 --> 0:4:9,489
>> CHRIS DONAGHUE: Yeah. And I always think it's about their subjective
experience. And that's why I think it's good that they


48
0:4:9,489 --> 0:4:11,52
showed the biological deterioration.


49
0:4:11,52 --> 0:4:14,57
You know, the neurology completely
over-stimulated, the stress response


50
0:4:14,57 --> 0:4:17,979
in the body, he's breaking down, he's not
functioning.


51
0:4:17,979 --> 0:4:21,949
I guess - you said high bar, low bar - I
put it on a continuum. So I would see him as the


52
0:4:21,949 --> 0:4:26,11
far end meeting all the criteria. Because it's
important that they meet multiple criteria,


53
0:4:26,11 --> 0:4:29,589
'cause if you take those apart - each one
of those is a component of just being a sexual


54
0:4:29,589 --> 0:4:30,53
person in the world.


55
0:4:30,53 --> 0:4:32,4
Preoccupation - we think about sex a lot,


56
0:4:32,4 --> 0:4:34,65
unmanageability - that will happen from
time to time.


57
0:4:34,65 --> 0:4:37,69
So I think you have to always look for
multiple criteria.


58
0:4:37,69 --> 0:4:41,56
I think we're a little too over diagnose - over
diagnostic culturally. I work with a lot of


59
0:4:41,56 --> 0:4:42,73
couples where


60
0:4:42,73 --> 0:4:46,15
one partner like sex a lot so they're a
'sex addict', they like looking at pornography


61
0:4:46,15 --> 0:4:49,8
so they're a 'sex addict'. The pornography they're looking at is
a little dirty - I think that's great - but they


62
0:4:49,8 --> 0:4:52,269
call them a 'sex addict'. 


63
0:4:52,269 --> 0:4:56,19
>> ALEX: Right, but I think that's the problem with using the term
sex addiction and how it's getting overused now.


64
0:4:56,19 --> 0:5:0,269
Somebody has an affair and they're a 'sex addict' -
and that's not true. That's just not true at all. But I


65
0:5:0,269 --> 0:5:2,259
think you're right, and I think


66
0:5:2,259 --> 0:5:4,24
it is a compendium of all 


67
0:5:4,24 --> 0:5:6,639
these problems


68
0:5:6,639 --> 0:5:7,61
in one package


69
0:5:7,61 --> 0:5:10,9
where the person just cannot function anymore.


70
0:5:10,9 --> 0:5:13,39
And that's when it's not sexy, it's not
funny, it's really


71
0:5:13,39 --> 0:5:14,8
really painful.


72
0:5:14,8 --> 0:5:17,53
>> CHRIS: Yes, because if you want to look at dirty, filthy
porn and bang five people in a day in an


73
0:5:17,53 --> 0:5:21,69
alley, and it's functional and it works for you -
congratulations. You have my support.


74
0:5:21,69 --> 0:5:23,379
Sounds like a great life but


75
0:5:23,379 --> 0:5:27,62
if it's deteriorating your body, it's impacting
your relationships, you're not getting through the work day -


76
0:5:27,62 --> 0:5:32,339
>> ETHLIE: If it's  marked by craving,
compulsion and withdrawal, which are


77
0:5:32,339 --> 0:5:35,929
you know, the physiological hallmarks of


78
0:5:35,929 --> 0:5:38,889
addiction as opposed to just the 'bad habit'.


79
0:5:38,889 --> 0:5:44,639
>> ANNA: I think that's a good time to ask the
addicts here - is that something


80
0:5:44,639 --> 0:5:49,199
- in terms of escalation, in terms of
all three components - is that something


81
0:5:49,199 --> 0:5:53,689
that happened with each of you?


82
0:5:53,689 --> 0:5:57,9
>> CARMEN: Yes. Carmen, sex and love addict.


83
0:5:57,9 --> 0:6:0,9
Yes, absolutely. Without a doubt.


84
0:6:0,9 --> 0:6:5,889
The craving was intolerable.


85
0:6:5,889 --> 0:6:7,52
And the withdrawal


86
0:6:7,52 --> 0:6:12,509
was intolerable.


87
0:6:12,509 --> 0:6:16,669
But if you can get into recovery, you can
get through it.


88
0:6:16,669 --> 0:6:19,78
And for me, getting into a 12-Step program


89
0:6:19,78 --> 0:6:23,8
was the thing that got me through it.


90
0:6:23,8 --> 0:6:25,819
It's been the only thing that's really


91
0:6:25,819 --> 0:6:28,29
got me through it.


92
0:6:28,29 --> 0:6:30,36
>> BUD: I'm Bud,


93
0:6:30,36 --> 0:6:35,3
sexually compulsive. If you've noticed - 
he couldn't have sex with someone


94
0:6:35,3 --> 0:6:36,599
he cared about.


95
0:6:36,599 --> 0:6:37,949
Marianne, the


96
0:6:37,949 --> 0:6:39,679
woman that he worked with.


97
0:6:39,679 --> 0:6:41,59
When he got close to her


98
0:6:41,59 --> 0:6:42,909
he couldn't


99
0:6:42,909 --> 0:6:45,249
perform sexually.


100
0:6:45,249 --> 0:6:48,629
He could have sex with people he didn't
love, but he couldn't


101
0:6:48,629 --> 0:6:52,419
have sex with people he loved. And that's


102
0:6:52,419 --> 0:6:58,949
a sign. He used sex as a substitute for
his close social and personal relationships.


103
0:6:58,949 --> 0:7:0,819
And he threw sex at


104
0:7:0,819 --> 0:7:8,43
his problems. So, for example, when
he had his climactic bad night


105
0:7:8,43 --> 0:7:10,559
with his sister,


106
0:7:10,559 --> 0:7:14,749
he went out and he just tried to prove
that he could have sex. I think even


107
0:7:14,749 --> 0:7:17,349
sex with Marianne was to


108
0:7:17,349 --> 0:7:20,569
retaliate to David, his boss,


109
0:7:20,569 --> 0:7:26,279
for having trouble at work. That he would
conquer his


110
0:7:26,279 --> 0:7:27,49
employee.


111
0:7:27,49 --> 0:7:32,329
So he threw sex at all of
his problems. And it still didn't work.


112
0:7:32,329 --> 0:7:33,38
>> MILES: Miles,


113
0:7:33,38 --> 0:7:35,759
sex addict. I -


114
0:7:35,759 --> 0:7:36,939
touching on that,


115
0:7:36,939 --> 0:7:39,849
one thing that 


116
0:7:39,849 --> 0:7:43,939
- that i believe is that sex
addiction is an intimacy disorder.


117
0:7:43,939 --> 0:7:45,129
And -


118
0:7:45,129 --> 0:7:49,65
that's a huge component of it, at
least for me and my experience with


119
0:7:49,65 --> 0:7:53,21
other people I've worked with.


120
0:7:53,21 --> 0:7:55,52
And what Bud was talking about -


121
0:7:55,52 --> 0:7:57,629
it was perfectly


122
0:7:57,629 --> 0:8:0,319
illustrated by


123
0:8:0,319 --> 0:8:5,279
- that in terms of his inability
to function


124
0:8:5,279 --> 0:8:9,439
sexually with someone he did care
about and his inability to have any


125
0:8:9,439 --> 0:8:13,29
relationships period. You know, he said the longest
relationship he'd ever had was just four


126
0:8:13,29 --> 0:8:16,25
months, and a number of other things, and 


127
0:8:16,25 --> 0:8:20,39
sex addicts tend to


128
0:8:20,39 --> 0:8:23,139
- it's a very


129
0:8:23,139 --> 0:8:27,539
- it's a very selfish disease and what you're
doing is you're using - rather than having


130
0:8:27,539 --> 0:8:28,55
a sensual


131
0:8:28,55 --> 0:8:33,889
or spiritual connection to
another person, it's a completely


132
0:8:33,889 --> 0:8:35,15
physical


133
0:8:35,15 --> 0:8:37,8
endeavor


134
0:8:37,8 --> 0:8:41,56
- that there's - it's - it's 


135
0:8:41,56 --> 0:8:45,54
- When I got sexually sober, I realized
that what i was doing


136
0:8:45,54 --> 0:8:48,68
when I was having sex with other people -
was I was actually just using another


137
0:8:48,68 --> 0:8:52,97
person for masturbation. I wasn't actually
having a connection to them.


138
0:8:52,97 --> 0:8:56,5
And that was kind of, you know, what my sex
life was like. I also like that they


139
0:8:56,5 --> 0:9:2,24
showed in the movie - his relationship
with pornography - and that was a very big


140
0:9:2,24 --> 0:9:4,2
addiction for myself.


141
0:9:4,2 --> 0:9:9,33
And I see - and I'm seeing more and more
people - especially with - it's so easily


142
0:9:9,33 --> 0:9:11,16
accessible right now 


143
0:9:11,16 --> 0:9:14,35
- I can't even open up my email,
you know, without having


144
0:9:14,35 --> 0:9:15,32
twenty


145
0:9:15,32 --> 0:9:18,31
invites to porn sites.


146
0:9:18,31 --> 0:9:22,46
>> ANNA: Well something for the therapists -
how do you know


147
0:9:22,46 --> 0:9:25,3
if someone - if a client is a sex addict?


148
0:9:25,3 --> 0:9:29,35
>> CHRIS: Part of it has to have a
subjective component.


149
0:9:29,35 --> 0:9:31,48
Because I think it's easy to get into


150
0:9:31,48 --> 0:9:36,3
this normalizing view of how things should be,
how sex should be, how relationships should be,


151
0:9:36,3 --> 0:9:38,68
such a multitude of configurations.


152
0:9:38,68 --> 0:9:40,41
The one addict mentioned


153
0:9:40,41 --> 0:9:43,209
having sex with the person as though they're not
a real person.


154
0:9:43,209 --> 0:9:43,94
If that's the only


155
0:9:43,94 --> 0:9:47,32
way you can be sexual, it's probably problematic.
I try to work with people having a


156
0:9:47,32 --> 0:9:48,47
full skill set


157
0:9:48,47 --> 0:9:52,31
where sometimes if you want objectified sex where it's all
about you - that's great,


158
0:9:52,31 --> 0:9:55,23
but you want to have the ability to tap into intimate sex
as well.


159
0:9:55,23 --> 0:9:58,3
So I think the first piece is
subjectively recognizing that this is


160
0:9:58,3 --> 0:10:1,62
not feeling good anymore, it's not working for me -
and take it from there.


161
0:10:1,62 --> 0:10:5,58
>. ETHLIE: I like to - I try to do little, like actual signs
as opposed to symptoms -


162
0:10:5,58 --> 0:10:9,31
one being objective and the other being
subjective - like if you've turned your


163
0:10:9,31 --> 0:10:13,84
monitor on your desk so that no one
else can see what's on it - Sign.


164
0:10:13,84 --> 0:10:18,7
Right? If you're keeping a list or a diary
of sexual conquests but lying to other people


165
0:10:18,7 --> 0:10:21,45
about your sexual conquests - Sign.


166
0:10:21,45 --> 0:10:25,46
If your number of sexual conquests is
approaching four figures -


167
0:10:25,46 --> 0:10:27,16
Sign.


168
0:10:27,16 --> 0:10:30,0
>> CHRIS: Wait, I don't think -


169
0:10:30,0 --> 0:10:31,5
>> ETHLIE: If you know the number - Sign.


170
0:10:31,5 --> 0:10:31,21
>> CHRIS: I just want to make sure -


171
0:10:31,21 --> 0:10:35,7
>> ETHLIE: I said sign, didn't say diagnosis. 
I said sign.


172
0:10:35,7 --> 0:10:38,7
You know, you stack up enough of themи


173
0:10:38,7 --> 0:10:45,7
If you're keeping trophies - Sign. If you have a certain
ritualized pattern, do your sex partners


174
0:10:45,7 --> 0:10:52,9
have to dress a certain way or look a certain
way for you - Sign. Not diagnosis. Sign.


175
0:10:52,9 --> 0:10:56,3
>> ALEX: THis is why Ethlie's book "Love Addict"


176
0:10:56,3 --> 0:10:58,2
is so hilarious and well-written


177
0:10:58,2 --> 0:11:1,67
if you're interested in reading more about love addiction. I
would say that what we do at the Center for


178
0:11:1,67 --> 0:11:5,63
Healthy Sex is that we use tests. One
of them is a test for hyper-sexual


179
0:11:5,63 --> 0:11:10,459
behavior that has solid psychometrics.
And that when people fall within these ranges


180
0:11:10,459 --> 0:11:14,459
they most likely have a problem. People
typically call our office because


181
0:11:14,459 --> 0:11:16,99
they're identifying as having a problem.


182
0:11:16,99 --> 0:11:19,37
They're saying "What I'm doing is not
okay for me."


183
0:11:19,37 --> 0:11:23,4
And there are a couple of self tests that
you can find on the internet if you


184
0:11:23,4 --> 0:11:25,47
google "sex addiction screening test"


185
0:11:25,47 --> 0:11:29,19
that will give people an idea about where
they are on the road map.


186
0:11:29,19 --> 0:11:33,12
And I'm in agreement with Chris - if
somebody says "I have a problem with this"


187
0:11:33,12 --> 0:11:34,88
then we have a problem.


188
0:11:34,88 --> 0:11:38,6
If they don't have a problem, it's not a
problem. 


189
0:11:38,6 --> 0:11:44,9
>> ANNA: So it's sort of the equivalent of the twenty questions
for addiction?


190
0:11:44,9 --> 0:11:48,14
>> ALEX: Sure. Or CAGE which is maybe, what? Four questions.


191
0:11:48,14 --> 0:11:52,8
>> ANNA: Right. Does anyone have anything else to add on this?


192
0:11:52,8 --> 0:11:53,29
>> MILES: I was going to say -


193
0:11:53,29 --> 0:11:57,3
Miles, sex addict - I was going to say one thing about 


194
0:11:57,3 --> 0:12:0,15
a point I wanted to make


195
0:12:0,15 --> 0:12:4,88
at least for myself, and I found this with, you know,
with a lot of the addicts I know -


196
0:12:4,88 --> 0:12:9,549
Sex addiction, indeed we get into the ritualization
and talking about


197
0:12:9,549 --> 0:12:11,83
how it's more - it's more about


198
0:12:11,83 --> 0:12:17,15
you know, the hours preparing and
searching rather than


199
0:12:17,15 --> 0:12:18,98
the actual orgasm


200
0:12:18,98 --> 0:12:22,17
- I know it's about -


201
0:12:22,17 --> 0:12:26,33
addicts tend to use this as a 
way to manage our


202
0:12:26,33 --> 0:12:30,75
feelings. You know, this is a coping
mechanism that we have learned to do


203
0:12:30,75 --> 0:12:34,38
with our feelings the same way
an alcoholic drinks


204
0:12:34,38 --> 0:12:39,19
perhaps to manage their feelings. Sex addicts
have learned that - you know, there's a reward


205
0:12:39,19 --> 0:12:43,89
center in my brain that I can activate
and it'll make, you know, my fears and - and 


206
0:12:43,89 --> 0:12:44,99
and uh...


207
0:12:44,99 --> 0:12:51,68
and bad feelings not be so present
if I engage in this behavior.


208
0:12:51,68 --> 0:12:53,9
>> ANNA: We're going to show the third clip


209
0:12:53,9 --> 0:14:53,9
and that is - "What are the signs of
love addiction?"
