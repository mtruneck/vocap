###6 Let's start off with a toughie. Who can tell me...?
###8 <i>The last few weeks</i> <i>an amazing thing has happened,</i>
###11 <i>I've been nailing rounds, I'm starting</i> <i>to separate myself from the pack,</i>
###15 Sir, the answer is Beck's triad.
###19 <i>It keeps me on top of my game,</i>
###21 Looks like a break in the ulna, right there.
###24 <i>It's good to be the king,</i>
###26 You know, it's OK to be impressed by me. Most girls are.
###31 <i>The problem with reaching the top</i> <i>is sooner or later</i>
###34 <i>someone starts nipping at your heels,</i>
###36 <i>For me that guy was Nick Murdoch,</i>
###43 Well, the gurney adds drama.
###64 <i>So that's the guy</i> <i>who wants to take me down,</i>
###67 Of course, you'll have a scar, Peter.
###69 You're not getting surgery but chicks dig scars so l'm gonna give you one.
###75 Doctor, Peter's drug rash is getting a lot worse.
###79 No problem, give him Prednisone...
###81 <i>Good bedside manner</i> <i>good rapport with the nurses</i>
###84 <i>sees me staring at him,,,</i>
###86 <i>Act busy,</i>
###88 That's the stud right there. That's where you'd...
###92 ...hang a painting.
###93 He was born John Dorian but he was simply known as JD:
###97 doctor, friend, lover.
###102 - Hey, man, how are ya? - Hey, how are you?
###104 OK... There that is.
###106 Gosh, can you believe we're doctors?
###108 The other night at a restaurant this guy starts choking.
###112 They asked if anyone was a doctor. l didn't even move.
###115 l still feel like l'm seven years old playing MASH with my older brother.
###119 l don't want to be Hot Lips again.
###122 Shut up and kiss Frank.
###126 l don't talk to my brother much.
###129 <i>What you doing?</i> <i>Don't connect with him,</i>
###131 - Well, l'll see you. - OK.
###134 What happened to that guy?
###136 Eventually l remembered l was a doctor.
###138 He'd been dead for 20 minutes. Very embarrassing.
###141 Food was good, though.
###143 <i>Don't laugh, Don't laugh!</i>
###147 <i>Damn!</i>
###150 Any time you wanna get more gauze, it'd be a real treat for all of us.
###155 - lt's hard being you, isn't it? - lt is.
###158 - What's with the smile? - This whole big bad wolf thing,
###161 it's such an act.
###164 Neato! Now whaddya want? A tip?
###167 Get out. Go, go!
###170 l'm not sure l agree.
###181 - You good T-dog? - Come on, man.
###183 l could do this with my eyes closed.
###186 - l won't, though. - Open the peritoneum.
###189 Nice, clean cut. Good.
###193 Good. Whoa, what's that smell?
###196 l don't know.
###198 - Did you nick the colon? - No.
###200 l mean, l don't know. l... l don't think so. Did l?
###202 Cut the music.
###204 You know, l kinda had a date last night.
###207 - Really? - Yeah.
###209 A guy on the bus fell asleep on me and drooled on my shoulder.
###212 - You slut. - Yeah.
###215 - How about Nick? - l'd let him drool on me.
###219 That's gross. Why did l say that? l shouldn't talk to people.
###222 l wouldn't know what to do even if l was interested.
###225 Well, you could start by looking at him.
###230 Did he look back? Why doesn't he like me?
###232 l can't believe l already blew it.
###234 <i>It felt weird trying to push Nick on</i> <i>her, This morning I wanted to kill him,</i>
###238 <i>He's so nice</i> <i>he probably would've helped me,</i>
###241 Come on, JD, you're not closing the windpipe. Put more pressure down here.
###246 Come on! l know you can do it! Come on! Come on!
###250 lf it isn't the brain trust.
###253 Someone tell me what this patient's rash is.
###256 You have until l finish my squeezy juice.
###259 <i>My God I'm drawing a,,,</i>
###261 <i>I can't remember what you draw</i> <i>when your mind draws a,,,</i>
###264 <i>,,,something,</i>
###265 - lt's Erythema Migrans. - Why don't you answer it?
###269 Everyone looks up to you. lt's important you don't get stumped.
###273 Besides, it's important to you, too.
###275 <i>Please like he knows me,</i>
###278 lt's Erythema Migrans, sir.
###281 Right you are, Dr Dorian.
###283 Nice.
###286 OK, there you go.
###288 Now you've got it. Oh, good.
###291 l don't know where that smell came from.
###294 - Er, sir? - What? Do you see something?
###297 Sir, l farted. That smell is from the fart l made.
###301 - Dude... - Get the hell out of my OR.
###305 Yes, sir. Good.
###308 <i>Time to put myself</i> <i>right back on top of Nick,</i>
###312 <i>That came out wrong,</i>
###313 Excuse me, Dr Cox? l know that you need to pick an intern
###317 to co-write that case report on post-partum...
###319 Yeah, sure. Congratulations. Now, go.
###322 <i>Mission accomplished,</i>
###323 Hey, buddy. How are ya?
###326 Dr Cox, l was wondering if l could co-write that case report with you.
###331 Newbie Ã  Newbie. Too bad it can't be a fight to the death.
###336 l didn't know you wanted to do it. You do it.
###339 Nice guys aren't even that nice.
###342 Now let me see, just exactly who to choose? Who to choose?
###359 Nice. Very nice, indeed. OK, over.
###365 lnteresting.
###369 Attaboy.
###372 l'm gonna go with... Guy Smiley, here.
###378 - Huge moment for me. - l know.
###381 l wish my dad was alive.
###384 <i>It doesn't mean anything,</i>
###386 You flipped a coin in your head?
###388 No. lt's just that, right now, he's better at internal medicine than you.
###397 OK, insult me, like you always do.
###400 Too easy. When you least expect it.
###405 Dr Wen threatened to sew my butt cheeks together.
###408 - Yet you continue to eat chilli. - Dude, l'm taking the cheese off.
###414 Even though nothing happened today, it still kinda freaked me out.
###419 One hiccup and that's the difference between life and death?
###423 lt's a lot to have on your shoulders, you know?
###429 What are you guys talking about?
###431 Cheese.
###433 Turk is so lucky l met him first.
###436 How's my man doing?
###439 Baby, most guys are here.
###441 But me, l'm, like, all up in here.
###444 Dr Turk, you can make the incision now.
###450 Sir, my hand's tightening up.
###452 - l must be low on potassium. - All right, l'll take over.
###461 Dr Murdoch, Peter's rash has gone but he's vomited six times in the last hour.
###465 No problem, give him Zofran and a 20cc per kilo bolus of normal saline.
###469 <i>Everyone's finally coming around</i> <i>to my way of thinking about Nick,</i>
###473 You're right, he definitely has a cute little butt.
###476 lt's almost like it's been sculpted.
###479 Who cares? Everybody's got a cute butt. l have a cute butt.
###482 You should bring it in some day.
###487 - How's Turk doing? - He's fine, why?
###490 He totally froze during surgery yesterday. Didn't he tell you?
###497 l feel like we haven't talked in ages. How are you?
###501 - Fine. - Yeah?
###503 Don't l look OK? You know?
###511 You know? l'm fine. As a matter of fact...
###513 <i>I am doin' OK I am doin' OK</i>
###519 Good afternoon, doctors.
###522 l've gathered you all here because, well...
###525 Attendance at my noon conferences has been very disappointing.
###530 l've begun to wonder if maybe you have something more important to do.
###535 Maybe you feel the need to sneak off and have a little nappy-nap?
###540 l love nappy-naps.
###543 Or maybe you've forgotten that my conferences are mandatory.
###549 My hospital, my rules!
###551 l've never missed one. Batting 1 ,000 over here.
###556 l'm more proud of you than l've ever been of an intern.
###560 <i>How do you like me now Nick?</i>
###563 So you see, sir, the poor attendance is my fault. And my fault only.
###567 Well, then, you have just won the privilege
###570 of writing my next ten lectures by this afternoon.
###578 Paging Dr Martyr...
###580 - What the hell was that guy... - Way to go, man.
###583 Nick, that was amazing.
###587 <i>,,,thinking?</i>
###592 <i>It's good to be the king,</i>
###599 <i>Things change when</i> <i>you're not the star any more,</i>
###605 What can l say? The lectures this kid wrote were fantastic.
###610 <i>The hospital starts to seem</i> <i>like a whole different place,</i>
###616 Hey, man. Want some company?
###620 No, l just wanna be alone.
###627 - Well? - Not yet. But soon.
###631 Very soon.
###636 Why would Turk talk to Elliot about this and not me?
###639 They're not friends, know what l mean?
###641 After 25 minutes, the only way l could know what you mean more
###644 is if you wrote ''My boyfriend doesn't open up to me'' on a mallet
###648 and smashed me over the head with it.
###650 Why can't you just for once dig down in your heart,
###653 access some emotions and empathise with me?
###658 - l'm sorry, what were we doing? - That's why no one likes you.
###661 You like me a little bit.
###664 And so do you, sweet cakes.
###669 Want a little sugar from Daddy?
###673 Well, looky here. l thought this was my special place.
###678 l'd ask you not to tell the others about this spot,
###681 but none of them are talking to you.
###684 lt's been a rough day, sir.
###687 You see, Dr Dorian, your problem is, you're a pansy.
###691 lf you were in my way, l'd throw you off this ledge right now.
###696 We're out here alone.
###700 No one would ever know.
###711 l'm gonna... l'm gonna... l have to...
###714 ...things.
###719 lnterns are fun.
###724 l'm single.
###726 That was more subtle in my head.
###730 Relax, l already left a message on your machine asking you out.
###734 - Really? - No.
###736 - But l will before you go home. - Works for me.
###740 Dr Murdoch, Peter's developed a high-grade fever and a cough.
###745 No problem. Give him Ceftazidime one gram lV.
###747 - How do you stay positive? - l don't let the bad stuff in.
###751 Try not to get too overwhelmed.
###754 Call me tonight when you get my message.
###761 His butt?
###765 So listen, l've scheduled an appendectomy for you later.
###768 Make sure you're good on potassium.
###771 l got so much potassium, it's coming out of my assium,
###774 you know what l mean?
###778 What l did was l took the word potassium and...
###781 l dropped the first three letters,
###783 made a doody joke.
###785 Funny stuff.
###789 - Looks like he bought it. - Excuse me?
###792 So you had stage fright. No big deal. Happened to me once.
###795 Really?
###797 l'd be more than glad to tell you what a lot of doctors do to relieve the stress.
###801 Take a little trip to Palm-dale.
###804 - What? - OK.
###805 Give yourself the old low five.
###807 - l'm not getting it. - Physician...
###811 ...love thyself.
###813 You talking about Downtown Lester Brown?
###816 Lowers the heart rate, releases endorphins. Basic physiology.
###822 OK, you almost had me.
###824 - You're not serious? - Yes, l am.
###827 - No, you're not. - Yes.
###829 No.
###833 Nobody hurts Carla and gets away with it.
###835 Who's Carla?
###837 l was talking to myself. Don't eavesdrop.
###839 lf this kid doesn't leave l'm gonna kill him.
###844 Now, if you leave, l'll know you were eavesdropping
###847 and l'll go and kill you anyway.
###849 Stay. Good girl.
###854 Tick, tock, Clarice.
###859 <i>Kelso's talk helped me</i> <i>figure out what I had to do,</i>
###862 Good timing. Give me a hand with this Foley cath, will you?
###865 <i>Whether or not Nick knew how jealous</i> <i>and competitive I'd been</i>
###869 <i>I felt I needed to step up</i> <i>lay it out there</i>
###871 <i>and apologise like a man,</i>
###873 Are we cool?
###876 Yeah.
###877 <i>Besides even if I was the star</i> <i>for a little while he's the man now,</i>
###881 This belongs to you.
###883 Thanks a lot, man. Can you grab me some tape?
###886 <i>Once you line up behind a strong leader</i> <i>everyone picks up their game,</i>
###890 We need the results of this urine sample.
###893 <i>We began to function</i> <i>like a well-oiled machine,</i>
###933 Nick, l got the results back from the...
###938 Nick?
###939 His blood cultures don't look good at all.
###942 No problem.
###957 Listen, l was thinking about what happened earlier and...
###961 Anyway... Here.
###966 You dug down in your heart and came up with a muffin.
###969 That's store-bought. Blueberries the size of your fist.
###972 l shouldn't have dragged you into it. You don't know Turk.
###976 Actually, l met him today. We had a terrific chat.
###982 Give the man a hand, that's just terrific work.
###986 You know darn well that felt good.
###988 Feeling better about yourself, aren't you?
###991 Real nice guy.
###992 lt's hard letting yourself be vulnerable with someone, you know?
###996 Just eat the damn muffin.
###1003 Even though l'm on call tonight, l'm not gonna let the bad stuff in.
###1007 Not gonna let myself get overwhelmed. What?
###1009 Friday, when you had people over, you locked yourself in your room
###1013 - because we brought the wrong chips. - Look at me.
###1016 That was the old Elliot.
###1019 Help me find Dr Murdoch. Peter's parents are here, he's not answering his page.
###1023 Sure. You know, Elliot's not gonna let herself be overwhelmed any more.
###1037 She's been drinking.
###1046 - You look great! - You're not messing with me?
###1050 No, but l'd like to.
###1053 Turk bought me this dress out of the blue. l guess he knew l'd love it.
###1059 Look, Carla, back when l was an intern,
###1062 l remember the pressure being so insane,
###1065 that the only way l could get by was to race home
###1067 and although my wife was asleep, l'd wake her, look her in the eyes,
###1073 and then passive-aggressively torture her
###1075 until she packed a bag and went to her mom's for the week.
###1080 Does that...help?
###1082 Like a big hug with words.
###1084 Just cos a guy has problems expressing himself,
###1087 that doesn't mean he doesn't need...
###1091 ...you.
###1094 Women so don't get me.
###1096 lt's not even funny. lt's mind-boggling, quite frankly.
###1100 The whole thing is stunning.
###1102 The point is that it's the scrubs, right.
###1104 Because in jeans, my butt is a force to be reckoned with.
###1107 - We were looking for you. - Nick, touch my butt, please.
###1113 Are you all right?
###1116 That kid is eventually gonna die.
###1119 Whether it's today or tomorrow.
###1122 Or a month from now.
###1125 There's nothing l can do. Nothing works.
###1127 His parents wanna talk to me. What am l supposed to say?
###1130 Peter lived a good long seven years? Seven years, man.
###1136 lt's not fair. l hate this place, this job.
###1140 - Nick, it's not your fault. - l can't do it any more.
###1143 l'm done. l'm done.
###1146 <i>The scariest thing was I thought</i> <i>he was stronger than all of us,</i>
###1151 <i>Maybe it's not about being the best,</i>
###1153 <i>Maybe it's about finding little things</i> <i>that get you through the day,</i>
###1157 <i>Whether it's the support</i> <i>of someone close to you</i>
###1162 <i>or letting yourself feel overwhelmed</i>
###1167 <i>if only for a moment,</i>
###1172 <i>Or being selfless every once in a while,</i>
###1182 <i>I don't know,</i>
###1183 <i>I guess in the end</i> <i>it's about surviving</i>
###1187 <i>any way you can,</i>
###1192 See you tomorrow.
###1198 You're stupid.
###1201 - That's it? - Give it time. lt'll eat at you.
###1210 - Am l stupid? - Yeah, a little bit.
###1214 Damn him! ï¿½
