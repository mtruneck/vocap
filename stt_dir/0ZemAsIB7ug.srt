1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:5,45



2
0:0:5,45 --> 0:0:8,67
GRIME: The idea that I would
create something that's going


3
0:0:8,67 --> 0:0:12,862
to elevate tattooing is
pretty ridiculous.


4
0:0:12,862 --> 0:0:15,49
Because people are going to do
what they're going to do.


5
0:0:15,49 --> 0:0:18,39
So I might be able to do a good
tattoo now and then and


6
0:0:18,39 --> 0:0:21,14
somebody's going to get it.


7
0:0:21,14 --> 0:0:23,95
But there's still going to be a
thousand other people lining


8
0:0:23,95 --> 0:0:27,21
up to get fucking really
horrific tattoos.


9
0:0:27,21 --> 0:0:30,23
HENRY LEWIS: He's a well-rounded
tattooer.


10
0:0:30,23 --> 0:0:32,4
You can tell he has
like a background


11
0:0:32,4 --> 0:0:34,47
in traditional Americana.


12
0:0:34,47 --> 0:0:36,49
I think that's kind of like
working with Hardy, where he


13
0:0:36,49 --> 0:0:40,7
got that from, and working with
Aaron Cain and Marcus


14
0:0:40,7 --> 0:0:44,38
Pacheco, that biomechanical
work that he does.


15
0:0:44,38 --> 0:0:50,15
I would say his style is
definitely rooted in Japanese


16
0:0:50,15 --> 0:0:51,78
work from the Masters.


17
0:0:51,78 --> 0:0:57,6
He's taken notes from like
Horioshi III, Filip Leu, and


18
0:0:57,6 --> 0:1:1,12
he's well-rounded in all these
different facets of tattooing.


19
0:1:1,12 --> 0:1:5,209
He's coined the "Grime Style."
And that's all taken from


20
0:1:5,209 --> 0:1:8,515
these educated styles of
tattooing and mastering them


21
0:1:8,515 --> 0:1:10,0
and then flipping them.


22
0:1:10,0 --> 0:1:12,475
[MUSIC PLAYING]


23
0:1:12,475 --> 0:1:28,315



24
0:1:28,315 --> 0:1:33,4
CIV: I like the unexpectedness
of his work, where I'm a fan


25
0:1:33,4 --> 0:1:35,39
of all the black claw stuff,
and the silhouette, and the


26
0:1:35,39 --> 0:1:37,57
really strong images.


27
0:1:37,57 --> 0:1:40,675
But then he'll just bust out
some pain in the ass little


28
0:1:40,675 --> 0:1:44,7
single needle stuff just
to show skill.


29
0:1:44,7 --> 0:1:47,56
I think anybody who has
identifiable work, whether


30
0:1:47,56 --> 0:1:52,36
it's traditional, or Japanese,
or just their own style,


31
0:1:52,36 --> 0:1:54,93
people are going to want
to collect from you.


32
0:1:54,93 --> 0:1:59,56
I think tattooers took notice
quicker than just fans.


33
0:1:59,56 --> 0:2:2,67
Because I think when you're in
it, you can kind of see when


34
0:2:2,67 --> 0:2:4,491
something is special.


35
0:2:4,491 --> 0:2:7,85
CHRIS O'DONNELL: It just seemed
like he had some other


36
0:2:7,85 --> 0:2:9,509
ideas in his head that he wanted
to get out and not just


37
0:2:9,509 --> 0:2:10,77
emulate his favorite
tattooers.


38
0:2:10,77 --> 0:2:14,71



39
0:2:14,71 --> 0:2:19,44
Grime started doing lots
of eyeballs with fire.


40
0:2:19,44 --> 0:2:21,69
-Is this the kind of fire that
people would copy from him?


41
0:2:21,69 --> 0:2:23,33
CHRIS O'DONNELL: The second he
started doing this kind of


42
0:2:23,33 --> 0:2:27,46
stuff with this signature fire,
it was horrible how many


43
0:2:27,46 --> 0:2:29,9
people were ripping him off.


44
0:2:29,9 --> 0:2:30,33
Everybody started doing that.


45
0:2:30,33 --> 0:2:33,61
It was so obvious what they
were looking at when they


46
0:2:33,61 --> 0:2:34,68
would draw a tattoo.


47
0:2:34,68 --> 0:2:37,8
GRIME: I did some strange style
of fire for a little


48
0:2:37,8 --> 0:2:41,71
while that people definitely
borrowed some of that stuff.


49
0:2:41,71 --> 0:2:45,16
But the thing is, it wasn't that
good what they borrowed.


50
0:2:45,16 --> 0:2:48,3
I thought they borrowed
it, whatever.


51
0:2:48,3 --> 0:2:49,4
But it wasn't that good.


52
0:2:49,4 --> 0:2:51,49
I would never tattoo
that flame now.


53
0:2:51,49 --> 0:2:54,52
I guess it just made me maybe
frustrated, but it also made


54
0:2:54,52 --> 0:3:2,61
me just try to be even more
creative, try to make me push


55
0:3:2,61 --> 0:3:6,26
my work in a way which wouldn't
be able to be copied


56
0:3:6,26 --> 0:3:9,89
in a way that would make
it look like I did it.


57
0:3:9,89 --> 0:3:14,71
I think my work, for the most
part, is too specific for the


58
0:3:14,71 --> 0:3:19,9
client, I think, to be taken
and just pieced together in


59
0:3:19,9 --> 0:3:22,85
another way and then look like
a straight rip-off of me.


60
0:3:22,85 --> 0:3:24,37
CHRIS O'DONNELL: That's part of
what makes Grime Grime is


61
0:3:24,37 --> 0:3:27,33
that he doesn't want
his tattoos to look


62
0:3:27,33 --> 0:3:28,2
like anybody else's.


63
0:3:28,2 --> 0:3:32,62
He wants to express himself,
desperately express himself


64
0:3:32,62 --> 0:3:34,16
through what he's creating.


65
0:3:34,16 --> 0:3:34,95
And why not?


66
0:3:34,95 --> 0:3:36,71
That's what he's here for.


67
0:3:36,71 --> 0:3:40,3
But it also spills over in ideas
like I guess I'm going


68
0:3:40,3 --> 0:3:42,92
to submit work to that person
for that book they're


69
0:3:42,92 --> 0:3:43,49
publishing.


70
0:3:43,49 --> 0:3:46,16
And he'd be like, I'm just going
to publish my own book.


71
0:3:46,16 --> 0:3:47,595
Why wouldn't I just publish
my own book?


72
0:3:47,595 --> 0:3:49,1
Why do that?


73
0:3:49,1 --> 0:3:50,23
That's how he thinks.


74
0:3:50,23 --> 0:3:54,72
He's like, why don't I just
create it myself?


75
0:3:54,72 --> 0:3:56,66
When he used to live with me
in Richmond, I would go to


76
0:3:56,66 --> 0:3:59,31
sleep 1 o'clock, 2 o'clock
in the morning.


77
0:3:59,31 --> 0:4:3,21
And he'd stay up all night with
headphones on and tons of


78
0:4:3,21 --> 0:4:7,39
tracing paper, just really
aggressively drawing all


79
0:4:7,39 --> 0:4:10,36
night, and then he would
be up before me.


80
0:4:10,36 --> 0:4:13,23
That definitely made me feel a
little lazy, having him on my


81
0:4:13,23 --> 0:4:15,37
couch doing that every night.


82
0:4:15,37 --> 0:4:19,49
This is a picture of Grime
working on his sketchbook, or


83
0:4:19,49 --> 0:4:22,44
journal that eventually turned
into "Two Year Autopsy." He


84
0:4:22,44 --> 0:4:24,7
had a brand new sketchbook that
I think Chris Duncan had


85
0:4:24,7 --> 0:4:26,8
given him for an art show.


86
0:4:26,8 --> 0:4:28,64
And the idea was a year would
go by and him and a bunch of


87
0:4:28,64 --> 0:4:30,735
different people would fill
up their own sketchbooks.


88
0:4:30,735 --> 0:4:32,52
He would do caricatures
of himself.


89
0:4:32,52 --> 0:4:34,63
He would do collage.


90
0:4:34,63 --> 0:4:36,11
He would write.


91
0:4:36,11 --> 0:4:38,4
He would put anything that
he was working on.


92
0:4:38,4 --> 0:4:42,56
It was like a diary,
a visual diary.


93
0:4:42,56 --> 0:4:43,94
He was traveling a lot, too.


94
0:4:43,94 --> 0:4:45,58
We would go to conventions
in Europe.


95
0:4:45,58 --> 0:4:50,61
We did Tin-Tin's Convention two
years in a row in Paris.


96
0:4:50,61 --> 0:4:52,69
That was great, because we would
go with enough time to


97
0:4:52,69 --> 0:4:54,44
explore the city.


98
0:4:54,44 --> 0:4:56,55
There's a couple days in Paris
where he would go out by


99
0:4:56,55 --> 0:4:58,35
himself with his camera
and just do


100
0:4:58,35 --> 0:5:0,84
self-portraits with a timer.


101
0:5:0,84 --> 0:5:2,79
He wasn't just tattooing.


102
0:5:2,79 --> 0:5:4,86
Everything was an art project
at that point because he


103
0:5:4,86 --> 0:5:7,49
wanted to use material
for the book.


104
0:5:7,49 --> 0:5:10,49
I like reading about
what he's thinking.


105
0:5:10,49 --> 0:5:12,72
GRIME: Yeah, on one hand, I like
to stay fairly private,


106
0:5:12,72 --> 0:5:14,8
but it is a little cathartic.


107
0:5:14,8 --> 0:5:16,96
But it also is like aiming
in two ways.


108
0:5:16,96 --> 0:5:20,86
I put it out there as an
exercise, but I also--


109
0:5:20,86 --> 0:5:23,41
the writing itself is
an exercise for me.


110
0:5:23,41 --> 0:5:24,91
I enjoy writing.


111
0:5:24,91 --> 0:5:28,8
The words I choose and how I
express the thought and the


112
0:5:28,8 --> 0:5:29,71
feeling, it's rewarding.


113
0:5:29,71 --> 0:5:30,5
It's real.


114
0:5:30,5 --> 0:5:31,365
I like it.


115
0:5:31,365 --> 0:5:33,88
CIV: When Grime did the book
"Two Year Autopsy," it was


116
0:5:33,88 --> 0:5:38,78
like two years on the road of
tattooing, but mostly two


117
0:5:38,78 --> 0:5:45,41
years of torturing himself
over predominantly women,


118
0:5:45,41 --> 0:5:48,442
which everyone enjoys doing.


119
0:5:48,442 --> 0:5:50,97
-Do you feel like a lot of
people come and try to speak


120
0:5:50,97 --> 0:5:53,5
to you about some things
that are more personal?


121
0:5:53,5 --> 0:5:54,41
GRIME: No.


122
0:5:54,41 --> 0:5:56,64
I don't think people-- no,
most people don't.


123
0:5:56,64 --> 0:6:0,732
Maybe they just don't feel
comfortable doing it.


124
0:6:0,732 --> 0:6:2,39
Maybe they just feel
uncomfortable going,


125
0:6:2,39 --> 0:6:3,64
so like, hey, so--


126
0:6:3,64 --> 0:6:6,41



127
0:6:6,41 --> 0:6:9,55
I read about that one
part where you're


128
0:6:9,55 --> 0:6:11,16
spilling your guts.


129
0:6:11,16 --> 0:6:13,82
Should we talk about it while
you're tattooing me?


130
0:6:13,82 --> 0:6:15,64
Yeah, I think most people
probably have a lot more tact


131
0:6:15,64 --> 0:6:17,652
than that, in some
ways, you know.


132
0:6:17,652 --> 0:6:21,508



133
0:6:21,508 --> 0:6:26,8
CIV: He sent it to a
psychologist to read and then


134
0:6:26,8 --> 0:6:27,67
critique it.


135
0:6:27,67 --> 0:6:29,74
And the psychologist said
something like--


136
0:6:29,74 --> 0:6:31,91
I'm paraphrasing, but it said
something like this is the


137
0:6:31,91 --> 0:6:37,857
most self-righteous bunch of
masturbation and pompous blah,


138
0:6:37,857 --> 0:6:39,68
blah, blah, just crushed it.


139
0:6:39,68 --> 0:6:43,1
And he was so excited that he
got this horrible review from


140
0:6:43,1 --> 0:6:45,48
a psychologist about it.


141
0:6:45,48 --> 0:6:49,37
"Two Year Autopsy," I think,
is an example of travel,


142
0:6:49,37 --> 0:6:52,87
torture, hard work pays off.


143
0:6:52,87 --> 0:6:56,41
It seems the more frustrated and
tortured he is, the work


144
0:6:56,41 --> 0:6:58,435
gets better.


145
0:6:58,435 --> 0:7:1,13
YUTARO SAKAI: We all do, but
he's almost like chipping away


146
0:7:1,13 --> 0:7:4,13
his life to make it.


147
0:7:4,13 --> 0:7:8,69
I think that people, whoever has
his tattoos, they have a


148
0:7:8,69 --> 0:7:11,2
piece of his life.


149
0:7:11,2 --> 0:7:15,9
Being this type of tattoo
artist, like fully custom


150
0:7:15,9 --> 0:7:19,295
every day, I think it's a
really stressful life.


151
0:7:19,295 --> 0:7:22,15
GRIME: Oh my God.


152
0:7:22,15 --> 0:7:23,24
Fucking people.


153
0:7:23,24 --> 0:7:25,6
YUTARO SAKAI: He's definitely
kind of a


154
0:7:25,6 --> 0:7:27,3
celebrity of tattooing.


155
0:7:27,3 --> 0:7:31,25
And he seems to not have much
of his personal time


156
0:7:31,25 --> 0:7:35,91
sometimes, and it's hard
for some people.


157
0:7:35,91 --> 0:7:39,54
CHRIS O'DONNELL: I don't know
if I've seen Grime get burnt


158
0:7:39,54 --> 0:7:42,41
out or in a burnout
phase tattooing.


159
0:7:42,41 --> 0:7:45,96
But he always kind
of seems like he


160
0:7:45,96 --> 0:7:47,2
was up too late drawing.


161
0:7:47,2 --> 0:7:47,91
You know what I mean?


162
0:7:47,91 --> 0:7:51,84
Like he always just seems a
little tired or preoccupied.


163
0:7:51,84 --> 0:7:54,91
He looks like he's always
stressing about whatever


164
0:7:54,91 --> 0:7:56,87
project he's working on.


165
0:7:56,87 --> 0:8:2,96
GRIME: Some of it's my ego, I
think, not wanting to say no


166
0:8:2,96 --> 0:8:5,51
to a project or a thing that
I know that I can do


167
0:8:5,51 --> 0:8:8,2
or I'd like to try.


168
0:8:8,2 --> 0:8:12,47
Although I've obviously learned
how to say no over the


169
0:8:12,47 --> 0:8:16,66
years, and I'm better at it as
time passes, but there are


170
0:8:16,66 --> 0:8:21,8
still some things that I think
maybe get out of my control,


171
0:8:21,8 --> 0:8:22,97
and that creates difficulties
for me.


172
0:8:22,97 --> 0:8:24,1
Dude, that's shit.


173
0:8:24,1 --> 0:8:25,34
Conventions suck.


174
0:8:25,34 --> 0:8:26,77
I just want to go
and make maybe a


175
0:8:26,77 --> 0:8:28,216
couple tattoos or something.


176
0:8:28,216 --> 0:8:30,42
Now it's like a whole
fucking thing.


177
0:8:30,42 --> 0:8:34,288



178
0:8:34,288 --> 0:8:35,538
GRIME: It's my job.


179
0:8:35,538 --> 0:8:40,639



180
0:8:40,639 --> 0:8:41,53
GRIME: No, there's no fun.


181
0:8:41,53 --> 0:8:42,98
I work every day on there.


182
0:8:42,98 --> 0:8:44,1
There's nothing to do but work.


183
0:8:44,1 --> 0:8:45,26
That's it.


184
0:8:45,26 --> 0:8:49,47



185
0:8:49,47 --> 0:8:51,35
GRIME: What if I didn't feel
like it's just all pressure


186
0:8:51,35 --> 0:8:54,69
and it's all everything
is everyone wanting


187
0:8:54,69 --> 0:8:55,94
something from me.


188
0:8:55,94 --> 0:8:58,398



189
0:8:58,398 --> 0:8:59,847
GRIME: I know.


190
0:8:59,847 --> 0:9:2,29
HENRY LEWIS: The man's always
working on something, I can


191
0:9:2,29 --> 0:9:3,13
say that much.


192
0:9:3,13 --> 0:9:5,37
There's always some
iron in the fire.


193
0:9:5,37 --> 0:9:8,79



194
0:9:8,79 --> 0:9:10,31
Which is amazing, too,
because it kind of


195
0:9:10,31 --> 0:9:13,45
keeps me on the ball.


196
0:9:13,45 --> 0:9:16,99
And it just keeps me wanting
to produce and create.


197
0:9:16,99 --> 0:9:18,88
And like I said, art for
the sake of art.


198
0:9:18,88 --> 0:9:22,92
GRIME: Maybe a little bit ego,
just wanting to say I'm here.


199
0:9:22,92 --> 0:9:25,69
Some kind of base--


200
0:9:25,69 --> 0:9:28,99
somewhat of a base artistic
kind of bend, which


201
0:9:28,99 --> 0:9:31,5
is, like, I'm here.


202
0:9:31,5 --> 0:9:34,75
This is my mark I've
left kind of thing.


203
0:9:34,75 --> 0:9:36,0
There's something about that.


204
0:9:36,0 --> 0:9:41,51



205
0:9:41,51 --> 0:9:43,442
-These are all the paintings
that are in the--


206
0:9:43,442 --> 0:9:46,432
GRIME: Yeah, my "Two
Year Autopsy."


207
0:9:46,432 --> 0:9:48,902
-Let's see them back here.


208
0:9:48,902 --> 0:9:52,19
GRIME: I'm just pissed
off all night.


209
0:9:52,19 --> 0:9:54,59
I don't feel like I'm
an artist right now.


210
0:9:54,59 --> 0:9:56,84
I have in the past.


211
0:9:56,84 --> 0:9:58,7
I don't feel like I've
been creating lately.


212
0:9:58,7 --> 0:10:4,0
So it makes me feel less
accomplished as an artist.


213
0:10:4,0 --> 0:10:8,386
-Do you have any concepts
started or--


214
0:10:8,386 --> 0:10:10,39
GRIME: They're in
my head, dude.


215
0:10:10,39 --> 0:10:11,572
What do I need to do?


216
0:10:11,572 --> 0:10:16,33
Either you do it or
you don't, yeah.


217
0:10:16,33 --> 0:10:17,89
There's not a thing
that I want to do.


218
0:10:17,89 --> 0:10:21,55
I just feel like I get ideas
for things I want to do.


219
0:10:21,55 --> 0:10:24,26
And then I'm like, OK,
I'll fuckin'--


220
0:10:24,26 --> 0:10:26,3
I'll write them down or I'll
have an idea about it and get


221
0:10:26,3 --> 0:10:26,7
some stuff.


222
0:10:26,7 --> 0:10:28,29
And I want to do other shit.


223
0:10:28,29 --> 0:10:30,87
Do I want to do a fucking
watercolor of


224
0:10:30,87 --> 0:10:31,63
a traditional tat.


225
0:10:31,63 --> 0:10:33,64
Fuck that, you know?


226
0:10:33,64 --> 0:10:35,45
I want to do shit that's
in my brain.


227
0:10:35,45 --> 0:10:36,37
I want to do cathartic work.


228
0:10:36,37 --> 0:10:42,88
Because to me, that's
what art is.


229
0:10:42,88 --> 0:10:44,37
It's the expression
of yourself and


230
0:10:44,37 --> 0:10:45,0
your point of view.


231
0:10:45,0 --> 0:10:46,29
If you don't have a point of
view, what the fuck you got?


232
0:10:46,29 --> 0:10:48,81



233
0:10:48,81 --> 0:10:53,16
And I think that's what makes
people drawn to art, is they


234
0:10:53,16 --> 0:10:58,113
feel the person's emotion or
personality come through.


235
0:10:58,113 --> 0:11:1,284



236
0:11:1,284 --> 0:11:2,19
GRIME: No.


237
0:11:2,19 --> 0:11:3,16
Don't remind me.


238
0:11:3,16 --> 0:11:6,19
I think I'm going
to do that soon.


239
0:11:6,19 --> 0:11:7,78
I need to.


240
0:11:7,78 --> 0:11:10,36
I need it.


241
0:11:10,36 --> 0:11:11,69
I have responsibilities
though.


242
0:11:11,69 --> 0:11:12,49
I have two dogs.


243
0:11:12,49 --> 0:11:15,302
I can't just go fuck off.


244
0:11:15,302 --> 0:11:17,43
They're human.


245
0:11:17,43 --> 0:11:19,2
Jones, motherfucker.


246
0:11:19,2 --> 0:11:20,35
Right?


247
0:11:20,35 --> 0:11:22,15
Owww!


248
0:11:22,15 --> 0:11:24,7
Hey, whose head's that?


249
0:11:24,7 --> 0:11:27,53



250
0:11:27,53 --> 0:11:29,87
And you know, I think
we change as people.


251
0:11:29,87 --> 0:11:32,0
I change as a person as I age.


252
0:11:32,0 --> 0:11:34,51
And so I seek different
things.


253
0:11:34,51 --> 0:11:36,6
And maybe things become more
difficult than they were when


254
0:11:36,6 --> 0:11:37,52
I was younger.


255
0:11:37,52 --> 0:11:39,9
Or maybe I just get
tired of them.


256
0:11:39,9 --> 0:11:43,54
Or maybe I have more work
than I ever have had.


257
0:11:43,54 --> 0:11:45,5
Maybe it's a combination
of all those things.


258
0:11:45,5 --> 0:11:49,33



259
0:11:49,33 --> 0:11:50,65
Jones!


260
0:11:50,65 --> 0:11:51,72
Mr. Jones!


261
0:11:51,72 --> 0:11:52,7
Come!


262
0:11:52,7 --> 0:11:54,97
Get your ass down here!


263
0:11:54,97 --> 0:11:57,52
Leave it!


264
0:11:57,52 --> 0:11:59,31
Ah, all right, what am
I standing here for?


265
0:11:59,31 --> 0:12:1,5
-Because we are walking
up here.


266
0:12:1,5 --> 0:12:2,77
I guess this is where you bring
your dogs a lot, huh?


267
0:12:2,77 --> 0:12:5,912
GRIME: Yeah, sometimes.


268
0:12:5,912 --> 0:12:7,13
Did you get that?


269
0:12:7,13 --> 0:12:8,535
Me and the dog drinking
at the same time?


270
0:12:8,535 --> 0:12:8,97
-Uh-huh.


271
0:12:8,97 --> 0:12:10,825
GRIME: OK, good.


272
0:12:10,825 --> 0:12:13,97
What kind of soundtrack are
we doing for this thing?


273
0:12:13,97 --> 0:12:14,71
-What kind of what?


274
0:12:14,71 --> 0:12:16,27
GRIME: Soundtrack we doing
for this thing?


275
0:12:16,27 --> 0:12:17,77
[MUSIC PLAYING]


276
0:12:17,77 --> 0:14:17,77
