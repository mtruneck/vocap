0:0:5,412 --> 0:0:9,398
The Internet in the year 2009.


2
0:0:9,398 --> 0:0:12,991
We send e-mails, make calls over the internet


3
0:0:12,991 --> 0:0:15,731
and discuss topics we take an interest in.


4
0:0:15,731 --> 0:0:18,546
Even our banking is going virtual.


5
0:0:18,546 --> 0:0:20,762
But what we take for granted today


6
0:0:20,762 --> 0:0:24,302
was only a vague idea fifty years ago.


7
0:0:24,302 --> 0:0:27,2
In order to understand how we got this far


8
0:0:27,2 --> 0:0:32,12
let's go back to 1957, when everything began.


9
0:0:32,12 --> 0:0:36,573
Before 1957 computers only worked on one task at a time.


10
0:0:36,573 --> 0:0:38,796
This is called batch processing.


11
0:0:38,796 --> 0:0:42,497
Of course, this was quite ineffective.


12
0:0:42,497 --> 0:0:44,504
With computers getting bigger and bigger


13
0:0:44,504 --> 0:0:47,444
they had to be stored in special cooled rooms.


14
0:0:47,444 --> 0:0:51,7
But then the developers couldn't work directly on the computers anymore –


15
0:0:51,7 --> 0:0:54,603
specialists had to be called in to connect them.


16
0:0:54,603 --> 0:0:57,293
Programming at that time meant a lot of manual work


17
0:0:57,293 --> 0:1:0,293
and the indirect connection to the computers led to


18
0:1:0,293 --> 0:1:6,73
a lot of bugs, wasting time and fraying the developers´ nerves.


19
0:1:6,73 --> 0:1:9,994
The year 1957 marked a big change.


20
0:1:9,994 --> 0:1:12,275
A remote connection had to be installed


21
0:1:12,275 --> 0:1:16,3
so the developers could work directly on the computers.


22
0:1:16,3 --> 0:1:20,1
At the same time the idea of time-sharing came up.


23
0:1:20,1 --> 0:1:23,77
This is the first concept in computer technology


24
0:1:23,77 --> 0:1:32,709
to share the processing power of one computer with multiple users.


25
0:1:32,709 --> 0:1:35,899
On October 4th 1957, during the Cold War


26
0:1:35,899 --> 0:1:41,764
the first unmanned satellite, Sputnik 1, was sent into orbit by the Soviet Union.


27
0:1:41,764 --> 0:1:45,904
The fear of a "Missile Gap" emerged.


28
0:1:45,904 --> 0:1:48,655
In order to secure America's lead in technology,


29
0:1:48,655 --> 0:1:55,713
the US founded the "Defense Advanced Research Project Agency" in February 1958.


30
0:1:55,713 --> 0:1:59,902
At that time, knowledge was only transferred by people.


31
0:1:59,902 --> 0:2:3,724
The DARPA planned a large-scale computer network


32
0:2:3,724 --> 0:2:7,744
in order to accelerate knowledge transfer and avoid the doubling up


33
0:2:7,744 --> 0:2:10,101
of already existing research.


34
0:2:10,101 --> 0:2:12,998
This network would become the Arpanet.


35
0:2:12,998 --> 0:2:15,818
Furthermore three other concepts were to be developed,


36
0:2:15,818 --> 0:2:18,809
which are fundamental for the history of the Internet:


37
0:2:18,809 --> 0:2:23,693
The concept of a military network by the RAND Corporation in America.


38
0:2:23,693 --> 0:2:28,262
The commercial network of the National Physical Laboratory in England.


39
0:2:28,262 --> 0:2:32,806
And the scientific network, Cyclades, in France.


40
0:2:32,806 --> 0:2:37,967
The scientific, military and commercial approaches of these concepts


41
0:2:37,967 --> 0:2:43,298
are the foundations for our modern Internet.


42
0:2:43,298 --> 0:2:47,549
Let's begin with the Arpanet, the most familiar of these networks.


43
0:2:47,549 --> 0:2:50,736
Its development began in 1966.


44
0:2:50,736 --> 0:2:55,47
Universities were generally quite cautious about sharing their computers.


45
0:2:55,47 --> 0:2:58,621
Therefore small computers were put on front of the mainframe.


46
0:2:58,621 --> 0:3:4,363
This computer, the Interface Message Processor, took over control of the network actvitities,


47
0:3:4,363 --> 0:3:9,634
while the mainframe was only in charge of the initialization of programs and data files.


48
0:3:9,634 --> 0:3:13,905
At the same time, the IMP also served as interface for the mainframe.


49
0:3:13,905 --> 0:3:17,118
Since only the IMPs were interconnected in a network


50
0:3:17,118 --> 0:3:19,776
this was also called IMP-subnet.


51
0:3:19,776 --> 0:3:22,777
For the first connections between the computers


52
0:3:22,777 --> 0:3:27,106
the Network Working Group developed the Network Control Protocol [Network Control Program].


53
0:3:27,106 --> 0:3:32,531
Later on, the NCP was replaced by the more efficient Transmission Control Protocol.


54
0:3:32,531 --> 0:3:37,445
The specific feature of the TCP is the verification of the file transfer.


55
0:3:37,445 --> 0:3:40,634
Let's take a short detour to England.


56
0:3:40,634 --> 0:3:44,495
Since the NPL network was designed on a commercial basis


57
0:3:44,495 --> 0:3:48,619
a lot of users and file transfer were expected.


58
0:3:48,619 --> 0:3:54,85
In order to avoid congestion of the lines, the sent files were divided into smaller packets


59
0:3:54,85 --> 0:3:58,91
which were put together again at the receiver.


60
0:3:58,91 --> 0:4:6,254
"Packet Switching" was born!


61
0:4:6,254 --> 0:4:12,448
In 1962 American ferret aircrafts discovered middle and long range range missiles in Cuba,


62
0:4:12,448 --> 0:4:15,215
which were able to reach the United States.


63
0:4:15,215 --> 0:4:19,7
This stoked fear of an atomic conflict.


64
0:4:19,7 --> 0:4:25,327
At that time information systems had a centralized network architecture.


65
0:4:25,327 --> 0:4:28,29
To avoid the breakdown during an attack,


66
0:4:28,29 --> 0:4:32,328
a decentralized network architecture had to be developed,


67
0:4:32,328 --> 0:4:37,541
which in case of loss of a node would still be operative.


68
0:4:37,541 --> 0:4:41,57
Communication still used to work through radio waves,


69
0:4:41,57 --> 0:4:46,701
that would have caused problems in case of an atomic attack:


70
0:4:46,701 --> 0:4:51,217
the ionosphere would be affected and the long-wave radio waves wouldn't work anymore.


71
0:4:51,217 --> 0:4:57,711
Therefore they had to use direct waves, which, however, don't have a long range.


72
0:4:57,711 --> 0:5:1,643
A better solution was the model of a distributed network.


73
0:5:1,643 --> 0:5:7,103
Thus long distances could be covered with a minimum of interference.


74
0:5:7,103 --> 0:5:11,759
Another milestone followed with the development of the French network "Cyclades".


75
0:5:11,759 --> 0:5:17,79
Since Cyclades had a far smaller budget than Arpanet and thus also fewer nodes


76
0:5:17,79 --> 0:5:22,69
the focus was layed on the communication with other networks.


77
0:5:22,69 --> 0:5:27,506
In this way the term "inter-net" was born.


78
0:5:27,506 --> 0:5:32,607
Moreover, Cyclades´ concept went further than ARPA's and the NPL's.


79
0:5:32,607 --> 0:5:38,756
During communication between sender and receiver the computers were not to intervene anymore,


80
0:5:38,756 --> 0:5:41,862
but simply serve as a transfer node.


81
0:5:41,862 --> 0:5:46,508
Cyclades´ protocol went through all machines using a physical layer


82
0:5:46,508 --> 0:5:48,84
that was implemented into the hardware,


83
0:5:48,84 --> 0:5:54,341
providing a direct connection with the receiver – an end-to-end structure.


84
0:5:54,341 --> 0:5:59,8
Inspired by the Cyclades network and driven by the incompatibility between the networks,


85
0:5:59,8 --> 0:6:4,26
their connection gained in importance everywhere.


86
0:6:4,26 --> 0:6:9,1
The phone companies developed the X.25 protocol which enabled communication


87
0:6:9,1 --> 0:6:15,995
through their servers – in exchange for monthly basic charge of course.


88
0:6:15,995 --> 0:6:22,617
DARPA's Transmission Control Protocol was to connect the computers through gateways...


89
0:6:22,617 --> 0:6:30,0
and the International Organization for Standardization designed the OSI Reference Model.


90
0:6:30,0 --> 0:6:35,71
The innovation of OSI was the attempt to standardize the network from its ends


91
0:6:35,71 --> 0:6:39,94
and the channel's division into separate layers.


92
0:6:39,94 --> 0:6:44,94
Finally, the TCP assimilated the preferences of the OSI Reference Model


93
0:6:44,94 --> 0:6:48,643
and gave way to the TCP/IP protocol –


94
0:6:48,643 --> 0:6:52,859
a standard which guaranteed compatibility between networks


95
0:6:52,859 --> 0:6:57,409
and finally merged them, creating the Internet.


96
0:6:57,409 --> 0:7:4,409
By February 28, 1990 the ARPANET hardware was removed, but the Internet...


97
0:7:4,409 --> 0:7:8,285
... was up and running.
