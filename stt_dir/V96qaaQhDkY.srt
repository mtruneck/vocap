0:0:17,76 --> 0:0:21,52
Morning, darling, I've made you breakfast.
Did you sleep all right?


3
0:0:21,52 --> 0:0:24,16
Erm... yeah. Yeah.


4
0:0:24,16 --> 0:0:26,2
I had a really weird dream.


5
0:0:26,2 --> 0:0:28,6
Did you, babe?


6
0:0:28,6 --> 0:0:31,68
I dreamt you chucked me
and I moved in with a girl I hardly knew.


7
0:0:31,68 --> 0:0:33,84
- I chucked you?
- Yeah.


8
0:0:33,84 --> 0:0:36,48
- As if !
- Yeah !


9
0:0:36,48 --> 0:0:38,6
- Aarrghh !
- Tim !


10
0:0:38,6 --> 0:0:41,56
Shit !


11
0:0:41,56 --> 0:0:52,24
Aarrghh !


12
0:0:52,24 --> 0:0:54,28
Shit.


13
0:0:54,28 --> 0:0:57,92
Son of a bitch !

0:0:57,92 --> 0:1:26,36
(The All Seeing Eye: The Beat Goes On)


15
0:1:26,36 --> 0:1:29,52
Tim? I'm really trying to work.


16
0:1:29,52 --> 0:1:31,76
- What you telling me for?
- Well, I...


17
0:1:31,76 --> 0:1:35,4
I can't concentrate with this mess,
I think it's time we unpacked.


18
0:1:35,4 --> 0:1:47,92
- I have unpacked.
- Have you?


19
0:1:47,92 --> 0:1:50,96
<i>I'm not talking about your room,
I'm talking about this room.</i>


20
0:1:50,96 --> 0:1:53,8
This is a shared area,
you've got stuff in here too.


21
0:1:53,8 --> 0:1:56,8
But it's under your stuff.
Soon as you clear up, I can do the rest.


22
0:1:56,8 --> 0:1:59,36
- I've got work to do.
- So you keep saying.


23
0:1:59,36 --> 0:2:2,48
I haven't seen you sit behind that typewriter
for longer than two minutes.


24
0:2:2,48 --> 0:2:8,32
- What do you mean?
- I mean... I think you're avoiding work.


25
0:2:8,32 --> 0:2:13,84
Oh, really?


26
0:2:13,84 --> 0:2:18,36
I just think we should draw up
some kind of a rota. All right?


27
0:2:18,36 --> 0:2:22,8
- All right.
- We need to establish domestic equilibrium.


28
0:2:22,8 --> 0:2:24,12
- OK.
- We need to get used to each other.


29
0:2:24,12 --> 0:2:33,28
We don't know each other that well, do we ?


30
0:2:33,28 --> 0:2:34,72
No.


31
0:2:34,72 --> 0:2:38,2
In the interests of making
this cohabitation charade work for us,


32
0:2:38,2 --> 0:2:40,24
we should do everything we can


33
0:2:40,24 --> 0:2:44,32
to try and make day-to-day life
as easy and enjoyable as possible.


34
0:2:44,32 --> 0:2:48,0
All right ! Look, I'm agreeing with you.


35
0:2:48,0 --> 0:2:50,72
Right. I'll get on with it, then.


36
0:2:50,72 --> 0:2:56,68
- All righty.
- OK.


37
0:2:56,68 --> 0:3:0,92
Right.


38
0:3:0,92 --> 0:3:5,32
I'm going to divide it
into kitchen, living room and...


39
0:3:5,32 --> 0:3:8,0
Right, then.


40
0:3:8,0 --> 0:3:59,2
(Tchaikovsky: Piano Concerto No 1)


41
0:3:59,2 --> 0:4:1,68
Hey.


42
0:4:1,68 --> 0:4:3,76
It's OK, it's me.


43
0:4:3,76 --> 0:4:5,8
- Gosh.
- How's it going ?


44
0:4:5,8 --> 0:4:9,4
Fine. How long have I been going ?


45
0:4:9,4 --> 0:4:12,16
- Two and a half minutes.
- Shit !


46
0:4:12,16 --> 0:4:14,28
- Listen, I've got an idea.
- What ?


47
0:4:14,28 --> 0:4:16,72
- Something I think you're gonna like.
- I've got to be getting on.


48
0:4:16,72 --> 0:4:24,4
It's important, Daisy. Trust me.


49
0:4:24,4 --> 0:4:27,16
Hm. I'm glad we did that.


50
0:4:27,16 --> 0:4:29,16
We had to really.


51
0:4:29,16 --> 0:4:32,76
It was inevitable. I'm just glad
we did it sooner rather than later.


52
0:4:32,76 --> 0:4:36,72
I think there would have been a hell of a lot
of tension if we'd left it any longer.


53
0:4:36,72 --> 0:4:42,92
You're telling me.


54
0:4:42,92 --> 0:4:45,76
What shall we do now ?


55
0:4:45,76 --> 0:4:48,24
I think we should descale the teapot.


56
0:4:48,24 --> 0:5:3,2
- You filthy bitch.
- You love it.


57
0:5:3,2 --> 0:5:15,16
Here we go. Here we go.


58
0:5:15,16 --> 0:5:17,88
Tim, what are you doing ?


59
0:5:17,88 --> 0:5:20,48
We're having a sale on X-Men comics
at the shop.


60
0:5:20,48 --> 0:5:25,8
Bilbo wants me to draw a picture of Wolverine
slashing prices with his adamantium claws.


61
0:5:25,8 --> 0:5:52,36
- I'm also doing a poster...
- All right !


62
0:5:52,36 --> 0:5:57,44
Oh ! Oh, my glasses ! Where are my glasses ?


63
0:5:57,44 --> 0:6:4,52
Oh.


64
0:6:4,52 --> 0:6:7,6
Right. Yes !


65
0:6:7,6 --> 0:6:10,64
Let's have a party !
Let's have a house-warming party.


66
0:6:10,64 --> 0:6:12,84
- What ?
- It'd be great !


67
0:6:12,84 --> 0:6:16,28
I could make invitations
out of plastic and tinfoil.


68
0:6:16,28 --> 0:6:19,28
We can invite Marsha and Brian.


69
0:6:19,28 --> 0:6:22,72
- Yeah, all right. When ?
- Tonight ! Let's have it tonight !


70
0:6:22,72 --> 0:6:25,52
Tonight ? ! That's a bit short notice.


71
0:6:25,52 --> 0:6:29,32
It'll be great, I'll call all my mates,
it'll be like Warhol's Factory -


72
0:6:29,32 --> 0:6:31,68
artists, writers, musicians,
dossers off the street,


73
0:6:31,68 --> 0:6:35,72
all interacting and relaxing in our pad,
the new hub of north London.


74
0:6:35,72 --> 0:6:37,84
The cutting edge ! You know ?


75
0:6:37,84 --> 0:6:40,92
We could have a glitter ball !
I could make one out of tinfoil !


76
0:6:40,92 --> 0:6:43,4
- All right.
- Yes !


77
0:6:43,4 --> 0:6:47,4
- But your room's the coat room.
- OK.


78
0:6:47,4 --> 0:6:49,2
Get this old thing out the way.


79
0:6:49,2 --> 0:6:55,4
? Party, um-by-ay, party, um-by-ay...


80
0:6:55,4 --> 0:6:58,92
<i>If we have it, they will come,</i>


81
0:6:58,92 --> 0:7:11,36
I said yes.


82
0:7:11,36 --> 0:7:13,4
Leave me alone !


83
0:7:13,4 --> 0:7:17,52
Holiday from what ? We'd all have
a bleedin' holiday, wouldn't we ?


84
0:7:17,52 --> 0:7:20,48
Oh, hello. Everything all right ?


85
0:7:20,48 --> 0:7:22,52
Teenagers, eh ?


86
0:7:22,52 --> 0:7:28,68
She's not a teenager,
she's the devil in an A cup !


87
0:7:28,68 --> 0:7:33,28
Well, us amiable bunch of 20-somethings,
us harmless happy-go-lucky lot,


88
0:7:33,28 --> 0:7:36,36
we're having a party tonight,
very small, very quiet.


89
0:7:36,36 --> 0:7:40,84
We wondered if you and Amber wanted
to come and throw coleslaw at each other.


90
0:7:40,84 --> 0:7:44,44
She won't come, she's having a party
of her own up here tonight.


91
0:7:44,44 --> 0:7:48,6
- You sure you want me there ?
- Oh, yeah ! We'd love it if you came.


92
0:7:48,6 --> 0:7:50,64
Will Brian be there ?


93
0:7:50,64 --> 0:7:53,4
I hope so, Tim's just gone to ask him.


94
0:7:53,4 --> 0:7:56,92
- Do you like him ?
- He's all right.


95
0:7:56,92 --> 0:8:6,28
Good legs.


96
0:8:6,28 --> 0:8:12,2
- Who is it ?
- Father Christmas.


97
0:8:12,2 --> 0:8:15,96
- Oh, it's you.
- Who'd you think it was ?


98
0:8:15,96 --> 0:8:18,48
Daisy wants a house-warming party tonight


99
0:8:18,48 --> 0:8:21,0
so she sent me to ask you
if you want to come.


100
0:8:21,0 --> 0:8:24,96
- Is Marsha coming ?
- I don't know, she's gone up to ask her.


101
0:8:24,96 --> 0:8:27,32
What's the deal with you and Marsha ?


102
0:8:27,32 --> 0:8:30,84
- You know about the deal ?
- What ? !


103
0:8:30,84 --> 0:8:33,36
I'm busy, Tim, painting a triptych.


104
0:8:33,36 --> 0:8:35,44
- Oh, yeah, what's it called ?
- Bad Sandwich.


105
0:8:35,44 --> 0:8:37,4
- Really ?
- Yes.


106
0:8:37,4 --> 0:8:41,84
It's a piece about violence in its immediacy,
the instancy of the event,


107
0:8:41,84 --> 0:8:48,68
a synchronic rendering
of three explosive, aggressive expressions.


108
0:8:48,68 --> 0:8:50,72
- There'll be girls at the party.
- Really ?


109
0:8:50,72 --> 0:8:53,84
- Yes.
- Mm.


110
0:8:53,84 --> 0:8:55,88
All right, mate ?


111
0:8:55,88 --> 0:8:59,16
I don't think we're gonna need any security,
it's gonna be very low-key.


112
0:8:59,16 --> 0:9:3,76
Well... Yeah, well, bring one.
Bring the Baretta. Yeah.


113
0:9:3,76 --> 0:9:7,52
No, bring the Glock 17, yeah,
that's my favourite.


114
0:9:7,52 --> 0:9:10,92
OK, I'll see you later. Bye.
Where have you been ?


115
0:9:10,92 --> 0:9:13,8
Talking to Marsha. What's a Glock 17 ?


116
0:9:13,8 --> 0:9:16,4
It's a gun.
You've been talking to Marsha for four hours ?


117
0:9:16,4 --> 0:9:19,64
Did you know her husband once drummed
for Status Quo ? Who's bringing a gun ?


118
0:9:19,64 --> 0:9:22,8
Mike. Is that what you've been talking about
for four hours ?


119
0:9:22,8 --> 0:9:25,56
Why is Mike bringing a gun to our party ?


120
0:9:25,56 --> 0:9:28,4
Security. Do you think she suspects
we're not a couple ?


121
0:9:28,4 --> 0:9:32,48
I don't think so. Why do we need security ?
We're not organising a rave.


122
0:9:32,48 --> 0:9:37,32
It's not that kind of security, it's like
a gonk, a troll, a Linus blanket, you know.


123
0:9:37,32 --> 0:9:40,36
Do we still have to hold hands in the corridor ?


124
0:9:40,36 --> 0:9:44,68
- Not if you don't want to.
- I didn't say that.


125
0:9:44,68 --> 0:9:50,88
We could probably cut down
on the fake sex noises.


126
0:9:50,88 --> 0:9:51,76
Shame.


127
0:9:51,76 --> 0:9:55,68
My friend Twist is coming.
Oh, you're gonna love her, she's brilliant !


128
0:9:55,68 --> 0:9:59,72
She's brilliant, really intelligent, funny,
talented, funny, funny, interesting.


129
0:9:59,72 --> 0:10:1,76
Forget all that. Is she fit ?


130
0:10:1,76 --> 0:10:3,6
She ran half a marathon for Fashion Aid.


131
0:10:3,6 --> 0:10:6,56
Have you managed to rustle up
any media types ?


132
0:10:6,56 --> 0:10:8,6
- Oh, yeah.
- Who ?


133
0:10:8,6 --> 0:10:11,4
- The paperboy.
- Smooth.


134
0:10:11,4 --> 0:10:12,6
What about you ?


135
0:10:12,6 --> 0:10:14,8
What with the Skaterama
at the East Finchley Uberbowl


136
0:10:14,8 --> 0:10:18,88
and the Tripods convention in Swindon,
most of my friends are otherwise engaged.


137
0:10:18,88 --> 0:10:22,24
Don't worry, Tim, it's gonna be great.


138
0:10:22,24 --> 0:10:28,88
I'm just gonna go and try on a few outfits.


139
0:10:28,88 --> 0:10:32,4
- Hello ?
- Oh, hi. Is Daisy there, please ?


140
0:10:32,4 --> 0:10:35,76
Hang on, she's just getting her clothes on.
Daisy ! It's your boyfriend !


141
0:10:35,76 --> 0:10:38,4
Shh ! Hi, Richard.


142
0:10:38,4 --> 0:10:41,92
- What did he mean by that ?
- 'By what ? '


143
0:10:41,92 --> 0:10:43,96
About you getting your clothes on ?


144
0:10:43,96 --> 0:10:47,68
We're having a house-warming,
I was trying to pick some clothes.


145
0:10:47,68 --> 0:10:53,64
- Oh, I see.
- 'How's it going ? '


146
0:10:53,64 --> 0:10:54,72
What's that ? !


147
0:10:54,72 --> 0:10:57,76
Daisy, I can hear sex noise !


148
0:10:57,76 --> 0:11:22,6
Shh ! Not now !


149
0:11:22,6 --> 0:11:25,8
I see it as a tribute


150
0:11:25,8 --> 0:11:28,68
to Christo, the artist.


151
0:11:28,68 --> 0:11:30,72
I see it as a waste


152
0:11:30,72 --> 0:11:35,36
of Baco, the foil.


153
0:11:35,36 --> 0:11:37,44
Party !


154
0:11:37,44 --> 0:11:42,92
OK, whoo ! Whoo !


155
0:11:42,92 --> 0:11:45,24
Music. Music ! We need warm-up music !


156
0:11:45,24 --> 0:11:47,24
Warm-up music, warm-up music.


157
0:11:47,24 --> 0:11:51,8
Party tape. Here we go.


158
0:11:51,8 --> 0:11:54,28
? Hot dog, jumping frog


159
0:11:54,28 --> 0:11:58,4
? Alma Cookies


160
0:11:58,4 --> 0:12:0,96
? Hot dog, jumping frog


161
0:12:0,96 --> 0:12:6,96
Come on !


162
0:12:6,96 --> 0:12:14,12
Ooh, try not to eat too much,
there's quite a lot of people coming. Yeah ?


163
0:12:14,12 --> 0:12:16,4
Hey, Brian, do you want some ice ?


164
0:12:16,4 --> 0:12:21,36
Come on ! Come on !
Come and get some ice, go on !


165
0:12:21,36 --> 0:12:24,4
Oh, God, I don't understand this !


166
0:12:24,4 --> 0:12:29,52
I defrosted this earlier. It just eats up
electricity and frosts up really quickly.


167
0:12:29,52 --> 0:12:33,72
I put half a Magnum in there this afternoon,
I can't get it out now.


168
0:12:33,72 --> 0:12:37,44
- It's almost as if it's...
- Self-aware.


169
0:12:37,44 --> 0:12:49,84
Yeah.


170
0:12:49,84 --> 0:12:51,88
- Hi, Mike.
- Tim.


171
0:12:51,88 --> 0:12:56,16
- Hello.
- Oh, hi. We're looking for the party.


172
0:12:56,16 --> 0:12:59,68
- Er, yeah, well, come on it.
- Are you Amber's dad ?


173
0:12:59,68 --> 0:13:5,16
It's upstairs.


174
0:13:5,16 --> 0:13:9,36
- You might have missed the puppet show.
- Fuck off !


175
0:13:9,36 --> 0:13:11,72
- What did you say ?
- They said "Fuck off."


176
0:13:11,72 --> 0:13:13,76
I know what they said, Mike !


177
0:13:13,76 --> 0:13:19,68
Little cow. Standing there with her purple hair
and her alcopops, giving it all that, "Hello."


178
0:13:19,68 --> 0:13:21,96
Sorry, this is my best friend, Mike.


179
0:13:21,96 --> 0:13:25,32
Hello, Mike. I'm Daisy, nice to meet you.


180
0:13:25,32 --> 0:13:28,8
How you doin' ? Sergeant Mike Watts, TA.
It's the longest way up, shortest way down.


181
0:13:28,8 --> 0:13:33,16
- Oh, you've brought something ?
- Yeah, I've got a... land mine.


182
0:13:33,16 --> 0:13:44,44
Oh, right, OK.
I'll just put that somewhere safe.


183
0:13:44,44 --> 0:13:48,28
Artist, writer...


184
0:13:48,28 --> 0:13:51,76
- Er, Mike.
- You never said Amber was having a party.


185
0:13:51,76 --> 0:13:55,72
Yeah. We'll show them.


186
0:13:55,72 --> 0:13:57,68
(Prefab Sprout: King Of Rock And Roll)


187
0:13:57,68 --> 0:13:59,96
What is this ? ! This is rubbish !


188
0:13:59,96 --> 0:14:4,0
We should be listening to firm, young
melodies, kicking tunes, thumping bass.


189
0:14:4,0 --> 0:14:14,76
God, I sound so stupid !


190
0:14:14,76 --> 0:14:16,6

Don't you look nice ? Bit of a midriff show !

- Hi.
- Hi.


197
0:14:42,72 --> 0:14:44,76
Hey, Twista, what can I getcha ?


198
0:14:44,76 --> 0:14:49,24
I shouldn't really drink because of the yeast,
but go on, I'll be naughty and have a spritzer.


199
0:14:49,24 --> 0:14:51,28
Is there anywhere I can hang my wrap ?


200
0:14:51,28 --> 0:14:54,32
- Daisy's room's the coat room.
- Right.


201
0:14:54,32 --> 0:15:1,4
She's great, isn't she ? She's great,
she's so funny !


202
0:15:1,4 --> 0:15:3,24
Oh !


203
0:15:3,24 --> 0:15:5,84
So, erm, you two have got separate rooms ?


204
0:15:5,84 --> 0:15:7,8
- No.
- Yes.


205
0:15:7,8 --> 0:15:8,12
- Yes.
- No.


206
0:15:8,12 --> 0:15:10,56
- We had an argument.
- We had a fight, Daisy snores.


207
0:15:10,56 --> 0:15:14,28
- I snore !
- Like a pig !


208
0:15:14,28 --> 0:15:18,36
- He's like a big sweaty pig !
- Ha, you're the pig ! I'm not the snoring one.


209
0:15:18,36 --> 0:15:21,2
That's why we sleep separately.


210
0:15:21,2 --> 0:15:23,6
- That's right, yeah. We're not a couple.
- Hey ! Hey !


211
0:15:23,6 --> 0:15:26,44
Y-you ! Funny. That is good.


212
0:15:26,44 --> 0:15:28,64
No, the fact is...


213
0:15:28,64 --> 0:15:30,8
We're not a couple. We lied to get the flat.


214
0:15:30,8 --> 0:15:32,88
- But we really like it here.
- We really like it here.


215
0:15:32,88 --> 0:15:36,4
- So, please, whatever you do, don't tell...
- Marsha !


216
0:15:36,4 --> 0:15:39,12
- Hello.
- Hi !


217
0:15:39,12 --> 0:15:42,12
It's me, the weirdo from upstairs.


218
0:15:42,12 --> 0:15:45,28
Oh !


219
0:15:45,28 --> 0:15:50,36
- Am I late ?
- No !


220
0:15:50,36 --> 0:15:53,92
- Hello, Brian.
- Hello.


221
0:15:53,92 --> 0:15:57,2
Erm, Twist...


222
0:15:57,2 --> 0:16:1,16
Marsha, this is Twist. She's in fashion.


223

Er, Marsha's... a landlady.


224
0:16:5,36 --> 0:16:8,36
- Hello.
- Hi ! Interesting outfit.


225
0:16:8,36 --> 0:16:10,88
Oh, thanks. Thought I'd make an effort.


226
0:16:10,88 --> 0:16:14,24
Mm, yeah. I can really see
what you tried to do.


227
0:16:14,24 --> 0:16:17,68
Yeah. Cheers.


228
0:16:17,68 --> 0:16:19,56
And that's Mike.


229
0:16:19,56 --> 0:16:26,32
Er... and... he's... a Mike.


230
0:16:26,32 --> 0:16:29,76
- Where shall I put me coat ?
- Er... ?


231
0:16:29,76 --> 0:16:30,92
Don't worry.


232
0:16:30,92 --> 0:16:34,52
I'll put it in Tim and Daisy's room.

You look great like that.

0:17:0,24 --> 0:17:2,88
You can just eat what you like
and you don't care if you get fat.


237
0:17:2,88 --> 0:17:4,96
I wish I didn't have to be so picky.

You can't trust them in that

stinks of garlic and looks like a turd in a wig.

You'd think with the money she's raking in
she could afford a new hairbrush.


244
0:17:26,0 --> 0:17:29,8
A T-shirt or something.


245
0:17:29,8 --> 0:17:32,72
Anyway. It's quite a nice flat.


246
0:17:32,72 --> 0:17:36,68
It'll be better when you've unpacked
and cleaned up a little.


247
0:17:36,68 --> 0:17:38,72
This is it, actually.


248
0:17:38,72 --> 0:17:45,28
Tim seems nice and friendly, doesn't he ?


249
0:17:45,28 --> 0:17:50,48
Come on, now, Daisy.
Stop feeling like a big, fat, ugly failure.


250
0:17:50,48 --> 0:17:54,28
Everything's going to be fine. Hm ? Hey ?


251
0:17:54,28 --> 0:18:2,12
Good.


252
0:18:2,12 --> 0:18:5,4
So, what do you do, Brian ?


253
0:18:5,4 --> 0:18:8,6
- He paints.
- Oh, yes ? What sort of thing ?


254

Erm...


255

- Tell her, Brian.
- Anger.

- You were there.

- Any problems ?
- No.


270
0:18:56,68 --> 0:18:59,8
Sorry. Do you think we're getting old, Mike ?


271
0:18:59,8 --> 0:19:1,64
Everyone gets old, Tim.
Everyone except my cousin Adam.


272
0:19:1,64 --> 0:19:2,96
What's so special about your cousin Adam ?


273
0:19:2,96 --> 0:19:5,76
- He is getting younger.
- Bastard. What are we gonna do ?


274

There's nothing we can do,
the government know.


275

I'm talking about what we're gonna do now !</i>

- I don't care ! I hate it, I don't wanna hear it !

I don't wanna hear it at a party, least of all

0:19:57,16 --> 0:19:59,2
No, I'd better not.

Go on, then, I'll have a half.
I'll have a half.


293

What we gonna do ?

0:20:46,2 --> 0:20:49,88
- We could slap each other about a bit more.
- I don't feel like it.


304
0:20:49,88 --> 0:20:52,4
We could go to Amber's party.


305
0:20:52,4 --> 0:20:54,28
- What ?
- Amber, the girl upstairs.


306
0:20:54,28 --> 0:20:56,2
Are you suggesting we crash Amber's party ?


307
0:20:56,2 --> 0:21:0,32

it'll just be a load of teenage girls.

- I'm the paperboy.

- Dips, the Timewarp, paperboys.

but you're having a good time, aren't you ?


320
0:22:3,96 --> 0:22:6,6
It's a party ! It's just a laugh !


321
0:22:6,6 --> 0:22:10,4
It's not a laugh ! It's not even a party.

Daisy, there'll be a time for dips. OK ?
But this isn't it.
