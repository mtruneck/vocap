1
0:0:6,92 --> 0:0:10,46
Activity on the building site is intense.


2
0:0:10,46 --> 0:0:21,81
The rainy season is fast approaching
and the roof still needs to go on.


3
0:0:21,81 --> 0:0:39,96
Everyone's pulling their weight
to complete on schedule.


4
0:0:39,96 --> 0:0:43,53
The roof is tiled with sago-palm leaves


5
0:0:43,53 --> 0:1:3,32
and rolls of tree bark
make the floor and walls.


6
0:1:3,32 --> 0:1:7,81
In two weeks, with 42 workers,
countless felled trees,


7
0:1:7,81 --> 0:1:13,56
30 bundles of palm leaves, 1 6 rolls
of bark and 5 kilometres of twine,


8
0:1:13,56 --> 0:1:16,21
the new home is complete.


9
0:1:16,21 --> 0:1:20,52
It's time to move in.


10
0:1:20,52 --> 0:1:51,77
As always, modesty dictates
a strict entrance policy.


11
0:1:51,77 --> 0:1:56,31
Everything must be carried up,
even family pets


12
0:1:56,31 --> 0:2:8,22
and it's a long way back down
if you forget something.


13
0:2:8,22 --> 0:2:11,35
The first fire is ceremonially lit,


14
0:2:11,35 --> 0:2:15,659
an interesting way to bless
a wooden tree house,


15
0:2:15,659 --> 0:2:29,15
but health and safety regulations
have yet to reach these parts.


16
0:2:29,15 --> 0:2:30,98
Parents are surprisingly relaxed


17
0:2:30,98 --> 0:2:41,26
as their children explore their limits
in the new home.


18
0:2:41,26 --> 0:3:6,18
Through knowledge, skill and ingenuity


19
0:3:6,18 --> 0:3:9,47
rainforest people
have mastered their environment.


20
0:3:9,47 --> 0:3:16,0
They live in tune with their surroundings


21
0:3:16,0 --> 0:3:21,18
and show it a respect
that's being lost elsewhere.


22
0:3:21,18 --> 0:3:53,14
Their remarkable lives remind us
that we are nothing without nature.


23
0:3:53,14 --> 0:3:55,68
Documenting the Papuan
tree house build


24
0:3:55,68 --> 0:3:58,719
was the most challenging shoot
for the Jungles team.


25
0:3:58,719 --> 0:4:3,81
They came prepared for two weeks
filming in the tree-tops,


26
0:4:3,81 --> 0:4:16,12
but when things went wrong, it was
the Korowai who saved the day.


27
0:4:16,12 --> 0:4:24,1
This shoot took cameraman Gavin
Thurston, researcher Rachael Kinley


28
0:4:24,1 --> 0:4:25,58
and producer Tom Hugh-Jones


29
0:4:25,58 --> 0:4:31,3
to some of the least explored
jungles in the world.


30
0:4:31,3 --> 0:4:32,3
We're about five days into the trip,


31
0:4:32,3 --> 0:4:36,28
we had a safe flight in, we had
a very good welcome committee,


32
0:4:36,28 --> 0:4:41,8
and I believe it's about
a three-day walk from here.


33
0:4:41,8 --> 0:4:46,69
No going back now.


34
0:4:46,69 --> 0:4:49,78
Though local porters
help lighten the load,


35
0:4:49,78 --> 0:4:54,48
trekking through the swampy jungle
proves tougher than expected.


36
0:4:54,48 --> 0:4:57,44
Well, I thought, if he's going in,
we've got to show willing, haven't we?


37
0:4:57,44 --> 0:5:4,35
I was going to come and help,
but I've just fallen in.


38
0:5:4,35 --> 0:5:10,3
But with only two weeks'filming,
they have to push on.


39
0:5:10,3 --> 0:5:15,28
The crew eventually arrive at
Lahayu's village to a warm welcome,


40
0:5:15,28 --> 0:5:16,84
Korowai style.


41
0:5:16,84 --> 0:5:26,28
This is Ninkana, and we are beginning
the five minutes of handshake


42
0:5:26,28 --> 0:5:30,4
that seems to be necessary
when you meet someone.


43
0:5:30,4 --> 0:5:42,77
Then it's time to talk business.


44
0:5:42,77 --> 0:5:46,44
Gavin's already spotted
some local wildlife in unusual places.


45
0:5:46,44 --> 0:5:48,89
This is Nasai,
if I've got his name right.


46
0:5:48,89 --> 0:5:50,65
He's got these amazing, um,


47
0:5:50,65 --> 0:5:52,62
apart from an amazing hornbill...


48
0:5:52,62 --> 0:5:54,5
penis sheath,


49
0:5:54,5 --> 0:5:58,62
he's got these feathers
on the side here.


50
0:5:58,62 --> 0:6:1,52
Yakob. I think that's
the sulphur-crested cockatoo.


51
0:6:1,52 --> 0:6:4,38
(IMITATES COCKATOO)
Noisy, yeah?


52
0:6:4,38 --> 0:6:5,82
What else?


53
0:6:5,82 --> 0:6:7,96
Mambro.
(IMITATES PIGEON)


54
0:6:7,96 --> 0:6:8,68
Pigeon?


55
0:6:8,68 --> 0:6:10,52
And the hornbill?


56
0:6:10,52 --> 0:6:11,62
Pfff...


57
0:6:11,62 --> 0:6:18,21
There we are, so that's
today's nature lesson!


58
0:6:18,21 --> 0:6:22,94
The crew go to inspect the ironwood tree
the Korowai have chosen.


59
0:6:22,94 --> 0:6:26,54
Well, the Korowai
have found a really good tree.


60
0:6:26,54 --> 0:6:28,89
It's probably about 70 feet
up to where they plan


61
0:6:28,89 --> 0:6:32,42
to build the tree house.
It's looking good.


62
0:6:32,42 --> 0:6:37,5
A line is fired into a nearby tree
to rig a camera position


63
0:6:37,5 --> 0:6:40,45
but the rope gets caught.


64
0:6:40,45 --> 0:6:45,88
One of these guys
has just shinned right up there.


65
0:6:45,88 --> 0:6:48,5
It's an unbelievable bit of climbing.


66
0:6:48,5 --> 0:6:49,14
All I can say is, if that was
anybody else up there,


67
0:6:49,14 --> 0:6:53,92
my heart would be in my throat,
but he just looks so at ease.


68
0:6:53,92 --> 0:6:58,59
Problem solved, thanks to the Korowai.


69
0:6:58,59 --> 0:7:2,57
Now the ropes are up,
it's Gavin's turn to impress.


70
0:7:2,57 --> 0:7:4,87
I think these guys are fascinated


71
0:7:4,87 --> 0:7:9,26
by how much paraphernalia
we need to get up a tree.


72
0:7:9,26 --> 0:7:15,87
Especially when I can't do it properly.


73
0:7:15,87 --> 0:7:20,66
The Korowai begin building
at an astonishing rate,


74
0:7:20,66 --> 0:7:24,87
leaving Gavin struggling to keep up.


75
0:7:24,87 --> 0:7:29,19
Just as he gets into the swing of things,
rain stops play.


76
0:7:29,19 --> 0:7:32,26
It's been raining for 1 7 hours solid,
I can't believe it.


77
0:7:32,26 --> 0:7:32,56
When it's this wet
it's not safe for them to climb,


78
0:7:32,56 --> 0:7:35,81
the logs are really slippery.


79
0:7:35,81 --> 0:7:38,84
The water table has risen so much now


80
0:7:38,84 --> 0:7:40,96
we've got standing water everywhere,


81
0:7:40,96 --> 0:7:41,98
and the other detail
you probably don't want to know


82
0:7:41,98 --> 0:7:47,68
is that the long drop too
is completely full.


83
0:7:47,68 --> 0:7:51,9
With work at a standstill,
the crew are invited for a social visit.


84
0:7:51,9 --> 0:7:53,63
It's a childhood dream.


85
0:7:53,63 --> 0:7:56,9
It's one of my first memories -
when I was about six or seven,


86
0:7:56,9 --> 0:7:59,1
building a tree house
about four foot off the ground


87
0:7:59,1 --> 0:7:59,99
in an apple tree in the garden


88
0:7:59,99 --> 0:8:3,65
and here I am coming to film
the world experts.


89
0:8:3,65 --> 0:8:6,57
All Korowai houses
are split into gender zones...


90
0:8:6,57 --> 0:8:14,4
...and, on the women's side,
Rachael's attracting a lot of attention.


91
0:8:14,4 --> 0:8:21,13
They seem to be wanting to get me
to dress a bit like them.


92
0:8:21,13 --> 0:8:23,95
Before long she's going native.


93
0:8:23,95 --> 0:8:29,8
A little more than expected.


94
0:8:29,8 --> 0:8:34,19
With the skirt safely fastened,


95
0:8:34,19 --> 0:8:37,659
all that's left is for her
to lose her trousers.


96
0:8:37,659 --> 0:8:43,69
We've had two hours of bonding
with these people.


97
0:8:43,69 --> 0:8:45,29
It's just been really nice to sit down
and get to know the tribe


98
0:8:45,29 --> 0:8:50,759
and to share some jokes with them,
let them laugh at us


99
0:8:50,759 --> 0:8:55,269
and see a bit of their life.


100
0:8:55,269 --> 0:8:59,459
When the rain stops,
the Korowai get going


101
0:8:59,459 --> 0:9:3,25
but Gavin's being encumbered
by all his gear.


102
0:9:3,25 --> 0:9:10,399
I wonder if anybody's ever filmed
a heart attack on a rope before.


103
0:9:10,399 --> 0:9:15,54
Once at the top of the tree,
Gavin's kit comes into its own.


104
0:9:15,54 --> 0:9:18,55
This is quite a clever device,
called a tree pod.


105
0:9:18,55 --> 0:9:19,459
It's got a couple of spikes


106
0:9:19,459 --> 0:9:22,49
and when you strap it to the tree
you get a really good solid base.


107
0:9:22,49 --> 0:9:25,759
The camera goes on top of there.


108
0:9:25,759 --> 0:9:27,92
The tree they've chosen
to put the tree house in,


109
0:9:27,92 --> 0:9:31,41
turns out it's the tallest tree
for a good few hundred metres.


110
0:9:31,41 --> 0:9:35,329
And one of the things we wanted to do
is be able to see the tree house


111
0:9:35,329 --> 0:9:38,829
in its environment, up in the canopy,
and give a sense of height.


112
0:9:38,829 --> 0:9:43,0
It must be getting on for ten storeys high


113
0:9:43,0 --> 0:9:44,889
and just made out of sticks and rattan.


114
0:9:44,889 --> 0:9:46,22
It's quite an incredible
bit of engineering.


115
0:9:46,22 --> 0:9:50,839
The whole time
they've been building this tree house,


116
0:9:50,839 --> 0:9:54,4
there've just been really scary moments.


117
0:9:54,4 --> 0:9:56,66
Right now there's quite a large tree
they're trying to fell


118
0:9:56,66 --> 0:9:59,12
but they are worried it might fall
towards the tree house


119
0:9:59,12 --> 0:10:0,529
and take out the ladder.


120
0:10:0,529 --> 0:10:2,389
So instead of everybody getting out,


121
0:10:2,389 --> 0:10:5,42
there's three guys with long poles
just pushing it out the way


122
0:10:5,42 --> 0:10:9,19
and they've got two more down here
with a bit of rattan


123
0:10:9,19 --> 0:10:12,37
pulling it, in the hope that
it will go away from the platform,


124
0:10:12,37 --> 0:10:18,769
but if it goes the wrong way,
those three guys are going to die!


125
0:10:18,769 --> 0:10:20,9
(WHOOPING)


126
0:10:20,9 --> 0:10:27,4
Another tree falls. This time
it's a little too close for comfort.


127
0:10:27,4 --> 0:10:33,43
Well, luckily they judged that one right
and it didn't come our way.


128
0:10:33,43 --> 0:10:39,749
The building's near completion, but
Gavin still has to shoot the big reveal.


129
0:10:39,749 --> 0:10:43,55
We've set up a line
from the tree the tree house is in


130
0:10:43,55 --> 0:10:45,36
across to where I was filming
from the tree pod.


131
0:10:45,36 --> 0:10:48,49
We're going to put the cable dolly on
and get a really nice pull back


132
0:10:48,49 --> 0:10:58,43
to reveal the tree house
right up in the canopy.


133
0:10:58,43 --> 0:10:59,89
(BEEPING)


134
0:10:59,89 --> 0:11:0,42
Please, baby.


135
0:11:0,42 --> 0:11:3,69
It won't go anywhere.


136
0:11:3,69 --> 0:11:5,72
- What has happened?
- (BEEPING)


137
0:11:5,72 --> 0:11:7,5
It's died!


138
0:11:7,5 --> 0:11:10,37
For the first time ever.


139
0:11:10,37 --> 0:11:11,699
Oh, (BLEEP)!


140
0:11:11,699 --> 0:11:17,389
Yet again the Korowai
come to the rescue.


141
0:11:17,389 --> 0:11:20,29
Traditional Korowai craftsmanship,


142
0:11:20,29 --> 0:11:23,519
a stick with another little bit of stick
tied on the end.


143
0:11:23,519 --> 0:11:27,439
Come on, baby!


144
0:11:27,439 --> 0:11:30,779
Gavin retrieves the camera dolly
in time for supper.


145
0:11:30,779 --> 0:11:37,48
Food supplies are running low
so the Korowai serve up a local delicacy.


146
0:11:37,48 --> 0:11:39,22
Sago grubs.


147
0:11:39,22 --> 0:11:44,139
They're basically giant beetle grubs
that live inside the sago palms.


148
0:11:44,139 --> 0:11:45,29
And they are a delicacy.


149
0:11:45,29 --> 0:11:48,999
The crunch at the end when you chew
their teeth perhaps isn't the best.


150
0:11:48,999 --> 0:11:51,269
But other than that
they are all right.


151
0:11:51,269 --> 0:11:53,249
GAVIN: You kept saying
you wanted protein.


152
0:11:53,249 --> 0:11:54,189
He's gagging!


153
0:11:54,189 --> 0:12:0,689
RACHAEL: I think they taste like caviar.
It's got that pop in your mouth.


154
0:12:0,689 --> 0:12:2,489
- Do you like them?
- Mmmm.


155
0:12:2,489 --> 0:12:6,79
- You can have the rest, then.
- Ah! Thanks. Some more!


156
0:12:6,79 --> 0:12:9,509
GAVIN: The verdict on the sago grubs is,
they are edible


157
0:12:9,509 --> 0:12:14,149
but they are actually
pretty disgusting!


158
0:12:14,149 --> 0:12:16,48
I'm still chewing!


159
0:12:16,48 --> 0:12:20,22
It's the final day and Gavin's last chance
to shoot the grand finale.


160
0:12:20,22 --> 0:12:23,23
Today, it's all come together.
The sun's shining,


161
0:12:23,23 --> 0:12:27,199
the guys are being really helpful
and the cable dolly is behaving itself


162
0:12:27,199 --> 0:12:36,749
and hopefully this is the end shot
for the sequence and the programme.


163
0:12:36,749 --> 0:12:39,92
It's just been incredible
seeing the whole process


164
0:12:39,92 --> 0:12:42,29
of how they build the house
this high up in the canopy.


165
0:12:42,29 --> 0:12:47,209
They all seem to have settled in
very well. Most of them are asleep now.


166
0:12:47,209 --> 0:12:52,689
I'm knackered as well, actually.


167
0:12:52,689 --> 0:12:54,8
Spending time with the Korowai


168
0:12:54,8 --> 0:12:58,22
has given Gavin
a different perspective on life.


169
0:12:58,22 --> 0:13:2,309
I find I judge my own inadequacies
against their expertise and knowledge.


170
0:13:2,309 --> 0:13:5,3
You come here and you've got
boots on in case of snake bites,


171
0:13:5,3 --> 0:13:7,189
you've got sun cream on
because of the sun,


172
0:13:7,189 --> 0:13:10,8
you've got twin safety ropes
to make sure, if one fails,


173
0:13:10,8 --> 0:13:12,249
you are caught on the other one.


174
0:13:12,249 --> 0:13:15,439
And these guys, OK,
maybe they have a higher mortality rate,


175
0:13:15,439 --> 0:13:17,129
but they're much freer
in their lifestyle.


176
0:13:17,129 --> 0:13:19,309
You know, they're shinning
up and down these trees.


177
0:13:19,309 --> 0:15:19,309
I think I'd much rather live a shorter,
fuller life, like they do out here.
