###0 the prosecution of bradley many continues uh... his court marshal is of
###4 course
###5 proceeding in june uh... they will be going to court
###9 today bradley many did something very unusual did what is called the naked
###13 plea
###14 meaning that he did not reach a plea agreement with the prosecution
###17 nonetheless he is agreed
###19 to uh... plead guilty on some of the lesser charges
###23 so you pled guilty to misusing classified material
###27 overall with ten of the lesser charges that he pled guilty to any now
###32 faces a maximum of uh...
###35 twenty years in prison because of that position of those charges carries
###39 and maximum both two years now when he did this
###43 he read a thirty five page statement in court that he had written himself
###47 and it appears that he did that
###50 because he's saying look
###52 this is a reality
###53 i did it because i thought it would help the country
###56 and it was me and i did give it to weaken leaks
###59 but well other charges like aiding the enemy are absurd i didn't do that
###64 and i will fight that
###67 as a strategy in the defense i don't know a lot of people are concerned
###71 uh... you it's giving away some of your leverage in some way
###75 on the other hand
###77 manning continues to be a man of tremendous principle
###82 i don't know anybody else who comes and says look
###86 uh... pleading to this cuz i did
###89 and it's not going to give me any advantage in my trial 'cause the
###93 prosecution continues
###94 snot like
###95 prolific all well he's being honest
###98 so will let 'em off don't they don't care the whole reason they're
###101 prosecuting him
###102 is because he was honest
###104 right and they're trying to set an example with them
###106 so they're gonna try
###107 it appears for a life sentence anyway
###110 but the man as usual is true his principles
###113 and we found out some other interesting things from his uh... testimony today
###118 first of all it turns out that he actually
###120 uh... contacted the washington post in the new york times and try to give them
###124 the story first
###125 so that's amazing
###127 neither of those papers were interested in what turned out to be
###132 one of the biggest stories of a generation
###135 and his story so gigantic there try to put this guy awake for a life
###140 and and they're doing their national manhunt basically enjoyin assigns 'cause
###144 he didn't carry this torch that's how much government cares about it
###147 the new york times larger post like that
###152 and i'll tell you why in a second but
###153 here's what the guardian reports about his interaction with the washington post
###158 quoting contact in the washington post
###161 and asked would it be interested in receiving information
###164 he said would be in
###165 norma sli important to the american people
###169 and their answer was i'm not really
###173 now y
###174 is it because they look at the information they were scared us that are
###176 now in a nana
###178 that in person the wife impose
###180 uh... have to check with my senior editors and we'll get back to you and
###184 was dismissive
###185 the new york times he left voice mail messages skype messages
###189 on many different reporters editors et cetera
###192 none of them either return his call
###195 because he's not an important person
###198 you see
###199 our media so he used to being fed information by the government
###203 that is pro-government
###205 and it could be pro republican report about democrat to depending on who's
###208 leaking information
###210 that they do
###211 but that's not only legitimate source of information
###214 well if i have a high esteem government official give me a
###218 press releases that is the skies as my
###221 you know article
###222 then of course i shot the return of talk radio lee
###224 on this guy
###226 has a treasure trove
###228 of incredibly important government information
###230 specialists
###231 for example in their past helicopter video
###234 that week
###234 murdered
###235 civilians children
###237 and reporters we killed two workers reporters
###240 you'll find that to be interesting news
###242 no it doesn't matter
###243 cousin on important person
###245 and so i'm not gonna take notes from you
###248 i'm i'm gonna ignore your permission
###250 horrible reporting
###252 horrible journalism
###253 so that's why he had to go to with unix 'cause await your weeks was only people
###258 journalism business at the time
###260 born people actually cared about information that would expose of the
###263 government was doing
###265 that's why the rest of
###266 the so-called journalist
###268 or soul insanely jealous
###271 of julian assigned
###272 and try to from one of the bus that every opportunity
###275 okay now why did manning do it
###278 starting continues to explain
###279 referring to the warlords from iraq and afghanistan
###282 he said he felt they would reveal the true cost award
###286 now does that sound like a guy who's trying to keep the enemy
###289 cells where you guys were stranded the the u_s_ public
###293 in understanding neutral cost the war
###296 so that we can make an informed decision
###298 on whether we stay in iraq whether we stay in afghanistan
###301 so that we know what our governments actually do it
###303 them asinine as we killed in afghanistan what we're doing diplomatically and by
###308 the way some of those diplomatic cables anne released change the world there
###312 were part of what led to the revolutions in tunisia and egypt by the way the new
###317 york times the washington post
###319 all those world changing
###320 documents not that important cuz you're not an important person who usually
###324 feeds me crap from the government rally many explained in his all the worse
###329 we were obsessed with capturing and killing human targets are lists
###332 and ignoring goals admissions
###335 i believe that the public particularly the american public
###338 concede this because spark a debate on the military
###341 an art form policy in general
###343 as it applied iraq and afghanistan
###346 it may cause society do we considered the meeting gauging counter-terrorism
###351 well ignoring the human situation of the people we need to use with everyday
###357 you know who says something like that
###360 whistleblower
###362 that someone who's trying to help the enemy someone who's trying to help us
###368 he is that classic definition of a whistle-blower
###373 and he was right
###375 we did kill those civilians in that helicopter attack
###378 we didn't kill those reporters
###380 report number civilians lead killed in iraq and afghanistan
###384 accurately
###385 he was right about it all
###387 and we would have been better off had we known that every permeation earlier
###391 we're better off knowing about what's also veto songs egypt as all the rest of
###395 the world
###397 but for that in america you do not get rewarded
###400 you get sent the president
###402 so because of his own admissions is now facing a maximum of twenty years at
###407 least but the government immigrate blood lust here
###410 to put away someone who's actually trying to help our democracy
###414 says it's not enough
###416 it's not enough
###418 we wanna life sentence
###419 and the thing that they want most of all
###421 is a one day it would connect many
###423 to julian assigns
###425 so they can go get him to
###428 because we had a rare moment of journalism break out here
###432 and what happened at the soviet and know what i government
###434 is actually doing
###436 in our so-called democracy
###438 and that is what the government
###439 isn't live in and out
###442 that's why they want on issue than a
###443 to the health and that's why would they want to go get it signs
###447 and try to put him away for life too
###450 it's sick
###451 we should all be against it
###454 and we should free bradley many as soon is humanly possible
