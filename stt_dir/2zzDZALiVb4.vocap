###23 JESSE HUGHES: Well we're at my house.
###25 It's like my getaway from the desert.
###26 It's the back house in Atwater.
###28 And a preacher and his wife live in the front house.
###30 I come from a really strong Christian background.
###32 I believe in the Ten Commandments, but I break 'em.
###35 I just don't need to believe in magic talking monkeys to
###37 break the rules, you know what I mean?
###38 But I love these guys, and I respect what he's doing.
###40 It's really weird, but I expect preachers to be good so
###42 I can be bad.

###60 JESSE HUGHES: See the evidence of throwing knives?
###63 An all night throwing knife session.
###65 Tuesday, my baby, is one of the deadliest knife throwers
###68 in the world.
###70 In here is a gratuitous mess.
###74 A lot of classic gear hidden all around here.
###77 And someone talked.
###78 This is very critical.
###79 I think this is the operating paradigm for
###81 the road crew member.
###83 A sailor sinking into the waters is
###85 because someone talked.
###87 We're all in a big ship called the rock and roll tour bus,
###89 and when someone talks, everything goes down.
###92 They find the hooker's body, you go to jail.
###94 
###100 I think this man found a genie, and he got one wish,
###103 and he wished for a little head.
###105 [LAUGHS]
###119 Oh, hello.
###120 Just kidding.
###121 Hi, I'm Boots Electric, sitting here, admiring a
###124 painting of myself.
###125 I was stricken with something.
###127 The road is an amazing, dangerous, unbelievable place.
###131 And when you come to the end, ultimately it's a big show
###134 with a giant flashing smoking head.
###137 And then there's the man behind the curtain.
###140 And in many respects the man behind the curtain, the Secret
###143 Service agent, the one who takes the rap
###146 and never gets credit--
###147 is the road crew member--
###149 the roadie.
###150 Starting with tonight at Queens of the Stone Age, and
###153 using one of the finest road crew members of all time--
###156 Hutch--
###157 Patrick Hutchinson--
###159 I think we're going to answer these questions.
###160 What is the roadie?
###161 What does it mean?
###162 What does he do?
###164 Let's find out who this shadow warrior is of rock and roll.
###167 [MUSIC CONTINUES]
###173 JESSE HUGHES: Soundchecks are a private world between the
###175 crew and a band.
###176 A time where trust is key.
###178 [BAND SOUNDCHECKING-PLAYING CIRCUS THEME]
###181 JESSE HUGHES: When you are working with someone like
###182 Hutch-- and I should say now that Hutch--
###184 he's a man of integrity, a man of respect.
###186 But it's his job every night to get that show up and
###189 running, to make these boys sound as
###190 beautiful as they can.
###191 He's the air brush in the giant bulge on that cover,
###194 guaranteed.
###195 He is the extra girth in the balls.
###197 When you are working with a band like Queens, it goes with
###200 it the reputation and foreboding of an almighty god.
###203 Terrible, vicious, and jealous.
###207 JOSH HOMME: Hey Hutch?
###209 HUTCH: Yes, Josh.
###210 JOSH HOMME: Did you know that Rush Hour 3
###215 take place in Paris?
###216 [SNARE HITS]
###217 HUTCH: I didn't know that.
###219 
###221 TROY VAN LEEUWEN: I've been working with him for about 15
###222 years, and if he believes in something, he will walk over
###227 glass and fire and hot lava to help see it through.
###233 JESSE HUGHES: It's like there's a lot magicians
###234 running around, and he's a wizard.
###236 TROY VAN LEEUWEN: He is definitely the wizard.
###238 [SOUNDCHECKING]
###248 JESSE HUGHES: You know when every rock and roller finally
###249 hits that road and takes up the dream, they dream of going
###252 to certain places, and I guarantee you one of the
###254 places they want to go to is the Wiltern Theater, one of
###256 the most magical venues that Sunset and
###259 Hollywood has ever known.
###261 HUTCH: When they come out of the gate, you can't simulate
###264 that in soundcheck, you know?
###265 They're gonna come out of the gate like 10 times harder than
###269 they soundchecked.
###270 Always.
###271 Boom!
###274 Like trying to jump on a bomb to smother it.
###277 
###280 JOSH HOMME: Well, well, well.
###282 If it isn't our old friend Los Angeles.
###283 How you doing tonight, everybody
###288 [MUSIC-QUEENS OF THE STONE AGE, "IF ONLY"]
###289 
###295 JOSH HOMME: Hutch became a soundman because DOA won a
###297 battle of the bands competition and Joe Shithead
###301 goes Hutch!
###303 You're the soundman.
###303 And they won a PA, which they then took and did all their
###306 shows with.
###306 And then that was how Hutch cut his teeth.
###309 Starting from going, what are all these knobs, to figuring
###312 out at least what a third of the knobs do.
###316 HUTCH: A friend of mine entered a
###317 contest in Creem magazine.
###320 JESSE HUGHES: Is that how you got into it mixing sounds, as
###323 a fluke of random chance?
###325 HUTCH: Yeah.
###325 We won a sound board and somebody had to
###327 learn how to use it.
###330 JESSE HUGHES: You, in my opinion Hutch, are the
###332 benchmark and the standard for what is required and what is
###335 the best of the best in rock and roll.
###337 And you do much more than just mix sound for a band.
###340 And Queens--
###341 there's so many phot shoots where you're pictured as a
###343 band member without even question.
###345 HUTCH: In the early days, for sure.
###347 JOSH HOMME: You know Theo van Rock, who used to do sound for
###349 like Rollins and I think Black Flag, they used to take photos
###354 with him and stuff.
###355 When we met Hutch--
###356 in the tradition of Theo van Rock and things like that--
###360 we've taken many photo shoots with Hutch because Kyuss was
###364 so in a bubble and naive about so much stuff that we didn't
###369 realize there was such a division between band and crew
###372 in most band situations.
###375 HUTCH: So my friends were learning how to play their
###377 instruments, and I was always into the theater side of
###379 things-- the production, the presentation.
###381 So it just naturally seemed like you do that part,
###384 I'll do this part.
###385 And so that's how I got started, but it wasn't til I
###389 started for bands like DOA that I got to see the country,
###391 and that what I like doing took me places.
###395 JOSH HOMME: It's DOA, No Means No, Taj Mahal, The Cramps,
###401 early Hole.
###403 That sounds funny.
###404 Early Hole.
###405 Like in the morning when you wake up and
###407 you have early hole.
###408 [LAUGHS]
###409 And you're like, oh my god, is this even mine?
###412 
###414 It's real.
###415 And Kyuss, and basically his pedigree kind of stops there
###421 in a way for a long time because the way Hutch has
###426 always approached it--
###427 like a family--
###428 was coincidentally the way we approached it.
###431 So I haven't played a gig without Hutch since I was 18.
###438 JESSE HUGHES: So I'm wondering what was the first band where
###439 you saw people that you were like, I like this, this is the
###442 way to do it.
###442 HUTCH: I noticed a chance to open for some big acts, like
###445 when Kyuss supported Faith No More.
###447 Those folks were really friendly and really helpful,
###450 and we got to see how a larger scale presentation was put on.
###453 Up until then we were five guys nuts to butts in the van.
###456 
###461 JESSE HUGHES: You know how I am.
###461 I really take very seriously the reverence aspect of this
###464 rock and roll thing.
###465 And when someone like Hutch gave me his approval for the
###467 first time, it was like getting a fucking graduation
###470 diploma in a way, you know.
###472 JOSH HOMME: When you work with Hutch, like in a way you're
###474 performing as much for a Hutch as any audience.
###477 There's a certain Hutch pressure.
###478 Like Hutch is never going to say that boy, you guys were
###482 super good.
###483 Like that.
###485 In all the years that Hutch has done sound with me, he's
###488 said, I think, about three or four times,
###490 that was fucking amazing.
###492 You know?
###493 And each time I was sort of like, you know, just
###498 [UNINTELLIGIBLE EMOTIONAL NOISES]
###499 
###503 [MUSIC CONTINUES]
###508 JOSH HOMME: Thank you so much.
###510 So this is it.
###512 This is the last show of our first wreck of tours.
###514 So I'm just going to shut up and keep playing.
###517 [MUSIC-QUEENS OF THE STONE AGE]
###518 
###522 JESSE HUGHES: I trusted you to tell me what's going on, and I
###524 know if something sucks you'll tell me.
###525 There's really no one like you.
###526 Not everyone can tell a band look dude, that sucked.
###529 And A, be able to get away with it in a way, but also B,
###532 make it-- it's true when you say it, you know what I mean?
###535 HUTCH: I care.
###535 I'm passionate.
###536 I want to see it better.
###537 JESSE HUGHES: Absolutely
###538 HUTCH: How can we make this better, yeah.
###540 And I've always worked with music that I loved and that I
###542 could be passionate about.
###543 It really keeps coming back to that.
###545 That the sacrifices you make touring-- leaving things and
###547 people behind--
###549 I'm out there with guys that I would take a punch for.
###552 JESSE HUGHES: And you've lived that--
###553 HUTCH: I love the music.
###555 I love what happens when the audience and
###557 the band gets together.
###558 That's addiction.
###560 I get addicted to that, for sure.
###562 [CHEERING]
###568 JESSE HUGHES: My grandpa used to say son, if it looks like
###570 an Indian and smells like an Indian, it sure as shit ain't
###572 John Wayne.
###573 And tonight really proved that.
###575 I saw in Hutch everything I hoped and I knew
###577 that I would see.
###578 A true wizard.
###579 But I'll tell you what right now, people.
###580 I am hungry for this.
###581 I've got an itch.
###583 We've seen the integrity side.
###584 We've seen the noble element and the shiny
###586 eagle of rock and roll.
###587 Well let's get to the underbelly.
###589 The snake's tongue.
###591 [MUSIC-EAGLES OF DEATH METAL, "WANNABE IN LA"]
###592 
###596 I want answers, god damn it, and I shall get them.
