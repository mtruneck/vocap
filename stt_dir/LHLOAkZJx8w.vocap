###15 JEFFREY BUSSOLINI: My name's Jeffrey Bussolini.
###17 And by training, I'm a sociologist and a philosopher.
###21 My main area of interest is to study cats--
###26 feline-feline interactions and feline-human interactions.
###30 Here's was one of my favorite shirts here.
###32 This is probably my single favorite shirt here.
###34 Hi.
###35 You're soft.
###36 I've lived with cats for a long time-- since I was about
###40 10 or so or maybe 9.
###42 We've done our best in the Center for Feline Studies to
###44 pay heed to the way that cats interact with one another--
###47 the way that humans interact with cats.
###49 And we spent a lot of time meticulously observing and
###52 trying to make sense of some of their behavior--
###55 some of their communication repertoires.
###58 The other thing that I study--
###60 because I grew up in Los Alamos, New Mexico--
###62 is the history of nuclear weapons development.
###65 And one of my teachers told me, you can't just be thinking
###67 about nuclear war all the time.
###68 You've got to have something else to occupy your thoughts
###70 that's less bleak-- that's funnier and more engaging.

###77 AMY KELLNER: I get emails whenever
###79 there's a new Mario video.
###81 And as soon as I get one, I'm like, stop everything.
###84 I need to see what Mario's up to.
###87 It really is like a drug.
###88 It just makes you feel good.
###90 Just give me the cuteness unadulterated.
###95 I don't want to hear anything.
###96 I don't want to see anything.
###97 I just want the cute stuff concentrated in my face.
###101 My name is Amy Kellner.
###103 I'm a photo editor at the "New York Times Magazine." Before
###107 that, I worked at "Vice" magazine.
###109 And when I was there, I invented "The Cute Show."
###117 I don't even think you should be shooting me for this.
###119 You should just hear my voice and just show a
###121 close-up of a kitten.
###123 That's all you really want to see.
###124 My favorite episodes of "The Cute Show"--
###126 "Cat Prin" was back in the days of Myspace.
###130 People would use them as their profile picture on
###132 Myspace all the time.
###133 The popular ones were in a frog hat or the bunny hat.
###137 I would just always see those.
###139 And it was always the same cats.
###141 And so I did some internet sleuthing.
###143 And I saw that it was this Japanese woman in Japan who is
###147 a cat tailor.
###149 JEFFREY BUSSOLINI: Many animals--
###151 especially younger members of animal species--
###154 have resemblances to young humans--
###158 so these things like larger eyes-- a particular kind of
###161 facial structure-- kind of round facial structure.
###164 And that humans have an evolutionarily developed
###167 capacity to sympathize with and protect young humans.
###171 So the theory is that many animals-- they trigger the
###174 same reaction for us.
###175 AMY KELLNER: She says that she started making clothes for
###177 cats because God told her to.
###180 I want a message from God like that.
###182 
###185 JEFFREY BUSSOLINI: Hello, Juliette.
###186 And welcome to the Center for Feline Studies.
###188 Please come in.
###190 This is where we study interactions between the cats
###193 and between cats and humans.
###195 They spend a lot of their time hanging out here in the
###196 different areas of the center.
###198 We've got our workstations where we can take notes about
###200 what they're doing and transfer those
###202 notes to the computers.
###203 So this is from April 11, 2008.
###206 We see two cardboard boxes of cats and four
###208 people standing around.
###210 Two tourists from Denmark are talking to the cats, trying to
###212 calm them down, saying that if they weren't so far from home
###215 and on vacation, they would take the cats in.
###218 We have two different sites of the center.
###220 This is the main site.
###221 And there are four cats who are usually here.
###223 We have another site--a two cat site-- where two sisters
###226 named Esmeralda and Mimi live.
###229 We also have a lot of photos.
###230 And we have some videos.
###232 But it's invaluable to have thousands or millions of
###235 different vignettes of cat behavior
###238 going on on the internet.
###240 AMY KELLNER: It's a subculture of cuteness and humor.
###243 
###246 JEFFREY BUSSOLINI: There's this underground notion that
###247 the internet is made of cats.
###248 Maybe you've seen that video.
###250 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###256 JEFFREY BUSSOLINI: And that's a fairly persuasive notion.
###259 Obviously, it doesn't hold any water technically.
###261 AMY KELLNER: Maybe we've gotten so jaded from all the
###263 sex, drugs, and rock 'n' roll that's there's nothing left
###265 except for just cats.
###267 
###276 AMY KELLNER: You know what?
###277 I will say the one downside to all the cute cat videos is
###280 it's kind of raised the cute bar so high that now when I
###284 see a regular cat, I'm like, you're OK--
###287 you know?
###288 JEFFREY BUSSOLINI: We as humans are formed by our
###290 interactions with cats, with dogs, with
###292 other kind of animals.
###293 That's something that's obvious to everyone who
###295 actually lives with animals, I think.
###296 Human culture is extensively indebted to animal references
###301 and animal interactions.
###304 AMY KELLNER: There is no deep thing to it.
###306 That's the beauty of it.
###307 There is no--
###308 I don't know.
###308 I just like it.
###310 I don't have to think too hard about it.
###314 I sound dumb.
###315 JEFFREY BUSSOLINI: One of the things we work on in the
###317 Center for Feline Studies is cat yoga.
###321 
###329 JEFFREY BUSSOLINI: We're trying to systematically look
###331 at yoga with cats.
###333 So the way in which a lot of their movements are basically
###335 a form of yoga because they're very limber.
###337 But then beyond that, how they'll join in yoga with us
###340 is a kind of intersubjective communicative experience.
###344 Hey, Prima.
###346 Come on.
###347 Come on.
###348 
###350 It seems like a very likely story that yoga and a number
###354 of martial arts were developed based on a really careful
###357 observation of the way that animals behaved and then
###361 trying to imitate that for humans.
###363 I'll try another kind of breathing exercise.
###365 During this one, if we're lucky, [INAUDIBLE]
###367 might hop up here.
###368 
###380 The thing that got me interested in cat yoga in the
###382 first place is that I would just be
###384 doing yoga at my house.
###385 Or we would be doing yoga there in the context of the
###388 Center for Feline Studies.
###390 And they started to join in.
###391 They started to show an interest in taking part,
###394 either by imitating some of the poses or by joining in--
###397 by getting on your stomach or getting on your back in
###400 different poses.
###403 Hey, [INAUDIBLE], come over here.
###406 [INAUDIBLE], oh, hey.
###408 [INAUDIBLE].
###410 
###414 They're all doing their own thing I guess.
###416 
###420 Sorry.
###421
