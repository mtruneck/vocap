Everything's bigger in America,


3
0:1:3,34 --> 0:1:4,843
we've got the biggest cars,


4
0:1:4,843 --> 0:1:6,94
the biggest houses,


5
0:1:6,94 --> 0:1:7,845
the biggest companies,


6
0:1:7,845 --> 0:1:8,846
the biggest food,


7
0:1:8,846 --> 0:1:11,849
and, finally,
the biggest people.


8
0:1:11,849 --> 0:1:15,353
America has now become
the fattest nation in the world.


9
0:1:15,353 --> 0:1:17,354
Congratulations.


10
0:1:17,354 --> 0:1:19,858
Nearly 100 million Americans
are today either overweight


11
0:1:19,858 --> 0:1:21,358
or obese.


12
0:1:21,358 --> 0:1:24,362
That's more
than 60% of all U.S. adults.


13
0:1:24,362 --> 0:1:25,863
Since 1980,


14
0:1:25,863 --> 0:1:29,367
the total number of overweight
and obese Americans has doubled,


15
0:1:29,367 --> 0:1:31,368
with twice as many
overweight children


16
0:1:31,368 --> 0:1:33,872
and three times as many
overweight adolescents.


17

The fattest state in America?


18
0:1:35,873 --> 0:1:39,878
Mississippi -- where one
in four people are obese.


19
0:1:39,878 --> 0:1:41,378
I grew up in west Virginia,


20
0:1:41,378 --> 0:1:44,381
currently the third-fattest
state in America.


21
0:1:44,381 --> 0:1:47,886
When I was growing up, my mother
cooked dinner every single day.


22
0:1:47,886 --> 0:1:50,889
Almost all my memories of her
are in the kitchen.


23
0:1:50,889 --> 0:1:52,389
And we never ate out,


24
0:1:52,389 --> 0:1:54,893
only on those few, rare
special occasions.


25
0:1:54,893 --> 0:1:56,894
Today, families do it
all the time,


26
0:1:56,894 --> 0:2:0,397
and they're paying for it --
not only with their wallets,


27
0:2:0,397 --> 0:2:2,399
but with their waistlines.


28
0:2:2,399 --> 0:2:4,401
Obesity is now
second only to smoking


29
0:2:4,401 --> 0:2:6,905
as a major cause
of preventable death in America,


30
0:2:6,905 --> 0:2:9,157
with more
than 400,000 deaths per year


31
0:2:9,157 --> 0:2:11,408
associated
with related illnesses.


32
0:2:11,408 --> 0:2:15,914
In 2002, a few Americans
got fed up with being overweight


33
0:2:15,914 --> 0:2:17,916

and blaming them
for their obesity and illnesses,


37

a lawsuit was filed in New York
on behalf of two teenage girls,


38
0:2:27,425 --> 0:2:32,931
one who was 14 years old,
4'10", and 170 pounds,


39
0:2:32,931 --> 0:2:37,185
the other, 19 years old,
5'6", and 270 pounds.


40
0:2:37,185 --> 0:2:41,438
The unthinkable
had suddenly become reality.


41
0:2:41,438 --> 0:2:44,692
People were suing the golden
arches for selling them food


42
0:2:44,692 --> 0:2:47,946
that most of us know isn't
good for you to begin with


43
0:2:47,946 --> 0:2:50,448

one in four Americans


44
0:2:50,448 --> 0:2:52,95
visits a fast-food restaurant.


45
0:2:52,95 --> 0:2:56,454
And this hunger for fast food
isn't just in America.


46
0:2:56,454 --> 0:2:58,956
it's happening
on a global basis.

In the United States alone,


52
0:3:13,47 --> 0:3:16,724
McDonaldís accounts for 43 %
of the total fast-food market.


53
0:3:16,724 --> 0:3:19,978
They're everywhere --

shopping malls,


55
0:3:22,479 --> 0:3:25,984

0:3:25,984 --> 0:3:27,985
That's right -- hospitals.

At least you're close
when the coronary kicks in.


58
0:3:30,989 --> 0:3:33,991
Lawyers for McDonald's
called the suits "frivolous",


59
0:3:33,991 --> 0:3:36,994
stating that the dangers of
its food are universally known


60
0:3:36,994 --> 0:3:39,497
and that these kids can't show
that their weight problems


61
0:3:39,497 --> 0:3:42,5
and health woes were caused
solely by their McDiets.


62
0:3:42,5 --> 0:3:44,1
The judge states, however,


63
0:3:44,1 --> 0:3:46,503
that if lawyers
for the teens can show


64
0:3:46,503 --> 0:3:49,507
that McDonald's intends
for people to eat its food


65
0:3:49,507 --> 0:3:51,8
for every meal of every day


66
0:3:51,8 --> 0:3:54,12

unreasonably dangerous,

to state a claim.

is the true cholesterol

any extra salt you're taking in,

0:9:11,796 --> 0:9:13,48
to meet a registered dietician


198
0:9:13,48 --> 0:9:14,798
who would help
track my progress.


199
0:9:14,798 --> 0:9:17,802
Okay, let's start with
getting your height and weight.


200
0:9:17,802 --> 0:9:19,303
Iím 6'2".


201
0:9:19,303 --> 0:9:21,805
I weight about 185.


202
0:9:21,805 --> 0:9:23,808
For your height,
this is a healthy weight.


203
0:9:23,808 --> 0:9:25,809
I can tell you that
right now.


204
0:9:25,809 --> 0:9:27,811
Your BMI,
which is the body mass index,


205
0:9:27,811 --> 0:9:30,315
is within normal limits,
which means you're not obese.


206
0:9:30,315 --> 0:9:32,316
You're actually
at the correct weight.


207
0:9:32,316 --> 0:9:35,32
So, I should keep a checklist
of the things that I eat


208
0:9:35,32 --> 0:9:37,321
for breakfast, lunch, and dinner?


209
0:9:37,321 --> 0:9:39,323
Your calorie needs
are gonna be averaging


210
0:9:39,323 --> 0:9:41,325
about 2,500 calories a day.


211
0:9:41,325 --> 0:9:43,827
As far as fat goes,
for 2,500 calories,


212
0:9:43,827 --> 0:9:47,331
you're gonna want about
80 grams of total fat in a day.


213
0:9:47,331 --> 0:9:50,835
The saturated fat, which is
a component of total fat,


214
0:9:50,835 --> 0:9:53,338
you want to have
less than 25 grams a day.


215
0:9:53,338 --> 0:9:55,84
Don't try to overindulge
too much.


216
0:9:55,84 --> 0:9:57,341
Good luck, Morgan.


217
0:9:57,341 --> 0:10:0,845
Hi, there. I'm Eric Rowley,
our exercise physiologist.


218
0:10:0,845 --> 0:10:1,845
Great.

Rowley:
the official weigh-in...


220
0:10:6,85 --> 0:10:8,852
1851/2.


221
0:10:8,852 --> 0:10:11,356
We'll go through
the cardiovascular assessment,


222
0:10:11,356 --> 0:10:13,857
and then I'll be able
to calculate


223
0:10:13,857 --> 0:10:15,86
how much oxygen
your muscles can utilize,


224
0:10:15,86 --> 0:10:17,361
and that's also an indicator


225
0:10:17,361 --> 0:10:20,365
of what type of condition your
cardiovascular system is in.


226
0:10:20,365 --> 0:10:23,867
All right, good work.


227
0:10:23,867 --> 0:10:26,371
Iím gonna use
these skinfold calipers


228
0:10:26,371 --> 0:10:28,872
to estimate
your body density.


229
0:10:28,872 --> 0:10:30,875
You're 11% body fat.
that's great.


230
0:10:30,875 --> 0:10:32,876
We're gonna
measure your flexibility


231
0:10:32,876 --> 0:10:35,38
of your hamstrings, your hips,
and your lower back.


232
0:10:35,38 --> 0:10:37,381
Good, good.
very nice.


233
0:10:37,381 --> 0:10:39,634
38 centimeters
was your best.


234
0:10:39,634 --> 0:10:41,885
There's a basic
old-school test


235
0:10:41,885 --> 0:10:44,389
for muscular strength
and endurance.


236
0:10:44,389 --> 0:10:45,389
36. Good job.


237
0:10:45,389 --> 0:10:47,391
You're above average


238
0:10:47,391 --> 0:10:49,393
above average fitness
for your age group,


239
0:10:49,393 --> 0:10:52,647
definitely, I'd say
you're at a good spot right now.


240
0:10:52,647 --> 0:10:55,9
More than 60% of Americans
get no form of exercise,


241
0:10:55,9 --> 0:10:58,903
so for the next 30 days,
neither will I.


242
0:10:58,903 --> 0:11:1,405
But I'll still have to walk.


243
0:11:1,405 --> 0:11:3,658
How much does the average
American walk a day?


244
0:11:3,658 --> 0:11:5,91
We have these pedometers
that we put on people,


245
0:11:5,91 --> 0:11:7,411
step counters.


246
0:11:7,411 --> 0:11:10,415
You could very roughly
estimate at about 2,000 steps,


247
0:11:10,415 --> 0:11:11,915
because 2,000
would make a mile.


248
0:11:11,915 --> 0:11:14,419
And we know that people
that work in office settings,


249
0:11:14,419 --> 0:11:16,42
who drive a car
to and from work,


250
0:11:16,42 --> 0:11:18,923
who take an elevator
up to that office,


251
0:11:18,923 --> 0:11:21,426
may take as little
as 2,500 or 3,000 steps


252
0:11:21,426 --> 0:11:22,926
in their entire day.


253
0:11:22,926 --> 0:11:25,93
If you wanted to feel physically
like a lot of Americans do,


254
0:11:25,93 --> 0:11:29,433
then you'd limit yourself
to about 5,000 steps a day.


255
0:11:29,433 --> 0:11:32,936
Us New Yorkers --
we walk everywhere.


256
0:11:32,936 --> 0:11:35,44
We walk to work,
to the park, to the store.


257
0:11:35,44 --> 0:11:37,441
Most of us don't even own cars.


258
0:11:37,441 --> 0:11:40,445
The average New Yorker will walk
four to five miles a day --


259
0:11:40,445 --> 0:11:41,945
a day!


260
0:11:41,945 --> 0:11:43,447
That's a lot of walking.

if I was a judge.

And like I was saying,


365
0:16:30,533 --> 0:16:33,537
if these fast-food places
can put their signs up,


366
0:16:33,537 --> 0:16:37,4
if I can walk by them
and just totally ignore them


367
0:16:37,4 --> 0:16:39,542
and say, "I'm not hungry.
I don't need this,"

0:16:39,542 --> 0:16:41,44
they can do it, too.

0:16:41,44 --> 0:16:43,547
We don't have to go there.
We don't have to shop with them.


370

we can easily go in McDonald's

but we choose not to.

0:16:47,55 --> 0:16:50,553
Now, if the McDonald's
refused them service,

Again, it can't be

381

neighborhood restaurants


382

383

It can't be the foods

Something is very different.


386
0:17:21,584 --> 0:17:26,59
I think the figure is we eat out
something like 40% of our meals.

MORGAN: John Banzhaf
is currently spearheading


388

0:17:30,94 --> 0:17:31,594

going through the process.


391
0:17:33,597 --> 0:17:35,98
People say he's crazy,


392
0:17:35,98 --> 0:17:37,351
but that's what
they used to say about him


393
0:17:37,351 --> 0:17:39,603
when he first sued
the tobacco companies...


394
0:17:39,603 --> 0:17:41,604
until he won.


395
0:17:41,604 --> 0:17:44,107
I think in terms
of responsibility,


396
0:17:44,107 --> 0:17:47,111
it's fair to point
the big gun at McDonald's.


397
0:17:47,111 --> 0:17:49,612
McDonaldís is
one of the biggest


398
0:17:49,612 --> 0:17:53,116
but, more importantly,
it is the one which,


399
0:17:53,116 --> 0:17:57,12
far more than all the others,
lures in young children.


400
0:17:57,12 --> 0:18:1,125
They have the playgrounds,
the closed, indoor playgrounds.


401
0:18:1,125 --> 0:18:3,127
Many places,
there are no other playgrounds.


402
0:18:3,127 --> 0:18:5,128
You've got to
take your kid there.


403
0:18:5,128 --> 0:18:6,629
So even at 2 and 3 and 4,


404
0:18:6,629 --> 0:18:9,632
those kids are being
lured into there.


405
0:18:9,632 --> 0:18:11,885
McDonaldís is very heavy
on birthday parties.


406
0:18:11,885 --> 0:18:14,138
They, of course,
pioneered the happy meals,


407
0:18:14,138 --> 0:18:15,638
now the mighty kids' meals also


408

with those little
"gotta have 'em" toys.


409
0:18:18,142 --> 0:18:19,642
So they get the kids in.


410

And, of course, the whole clown.
McDonald's has the clown.


411
0:18:22,646 --> 0:18:25,149
A lot of those ads
appeal primarily to kids.

0:18:25,149 --> 0:18:27,902
There's a cartoon on TV
which features him.


413
0:18:27,902 --> 0:18:30,653
So they, more than others,
lure the kids in.


414
0:18:30,653 --> 0:18:34,158
I think all of us are far more
concerned about the kids.

who is worried about the kids


416
0:18:36,16 --> 0:18:38,161

who are suing McDonald's,

with much advisement
coming from professor Banzhaf.

0:18:44,168 --> 0:18:47,672
Why are you suing
the fast-food establishment?


420
0:18:47,672 --> 0:18:51,175
You mean motives besides
monetary recompensation?


421
0:18:51,175 --> 0:18:54,178
You mean you want

0:18:57,18 --> 0:18:58,681
Um...


424
0:18:58,681 --> 0:19:0,183
I think that fast foods


425
0:19:0,183 --> 0:19:3,686
are a major contributor
to this epidemic.


426
0:19:3,686 --> 0:19:5,188
MORGAN: In 2000,
Dr. David Satcher


427
0:19:5,188 --> 0:19:6,689
became the first surgeon general


428
0:19:6,689 --> 0:19:9,192
to draw attention
to the obesity crisis,


429
0:19:9,192 --> 0:19:11,194
declaring it
a national epidemic.


430
0:19:11,194 --> 0:19:15,698
Now, remember,
we're super-sizing everything.


431
0:19:15,698 --> 0:19:18,201
You go to any fast food store,


432
0:19:18,201 --> 0:19:21,705
and they're trained to tell you
to buy a bigger size.


433
0:19:21,705 --> 0:19:24,708
For five cents more,
you can get the super size.


434
0:19:24,708 --> 0:19:27,461
Federal government
will define a piece of meat,


435
0:19:27,461 --> 0:19:30,214
three ounces of meat,
as a sensible portion,


436
0:19:30,214 --> 0:19:32,715
and that looks like
a deck of cards.


437
0:19:32,715 --> 0:19:35,718
Few people would be able
to find this deck of cards


438
0:19:35,718 --> 0:19:38,222
if they were served a piece of
meat, a steak, in a restaurant.


439
0:19:38,222 --> 0:19:41,224
It would probably be about
four or five times this size.


440

One typical bagel

441
0:19:43,227 --> 0:19:45,728

is going to comprise
five servings of bread.


443
0:19:48,732 --> 0:19:51,235
When fast food companies
first opened,


444
0:19:51,235 --> 0:19:53,738
they generally
introduced one size.


445
0:19:53,738 --> 0:19:56,239
For example,
one size French fries


446
0:19:56,239 --> 0:19:59,743
when McDonald's first opened,
called "fries."


447
0:19:59,743 --> 0:20:2,746
that size fries
is now called "small."

0:20:2,746 --> 0:20:7,25
Medium, large, and super size.

0:20:7,25 --> 0:20:9,753
That original size
is still here.

It's got about 200 calories.


451
0:20:11,754 --> 0:20:14,758
but the super size is gonna
pack in over 600 calories.


452
0:20:14,758 --> 0:20:16,759
When Burger King first opened,


453
0:20:16,759 --> 0:20:20,264
they had a 12-ounce small
and a 16-ounce large.


454
0:20:20,264 --> 0:20:22,265
This 12-ounce is now kiddy.


455
0:20:22,265 --> 0:20:24,768
The 16-ounce is now the small...


456

the medium, the 32, and the 42


457
0:20:27,77 --> 0:20:30,773
and this is across the board
with all fast-food places.


458
0:20:30,773 --> 0:20:33,776

Left unabated,

566
0:25:55,31 --> 0:25:58,35
as the leading preventable cause
of death in this country.


567
0:25:58,35 --> 0:26:0,536
SULLUM: I was at this meal,
and it came up


568
0:26:0,536 --> 0:26:2,538
that one of the people
was a smoker,


569
0:26:2,538 --> 0:26:5,542
and somebody else at the table
started hectoring them about it.


570
0:26:5,542 --> 0:26:7,43
"What's the matter with you?


571
0:26:7,43 --> 0:26:9,45
"Don't you know
how bad it is for you?


572
0:26:9,45 --> 0:26:11,547
"It'll do this, that,
and the other thing to you,


573
0:26:11,547 --> 0:26:12,548
and you really should stop."


574
0:26:12,548 --> 0:26:15,52
And the smoker,
rather than saying, "fuck you,


575
0:26:15,52 --> 0:26:16,552
mind your own business" --


576
0:26:16,552 --> 0:26:18,55
Which, I think,
is the appropriate response --


577
0:26:18,55 --> 0:26:20,57
was abashed and defensive.


578
0:26:20,57 --> 0:26:22,558
"Oh, I tried to quit,"


579
0:26:22,558 --> 0:26:24,6
and, "yeah,
I'm gonna try again,"


580
0:26:24,6 --> 0:26:26,62
and "you're right,
you're right," and so on.


581
0:26:26,62 --> 0:26:28,564
At that same table,
there was a quite large woman,


582
0:26:28,564 --> 0:26:30,567
and I was wondering --
what if this guy,


583
0:26:30,567 --> 0:26:33,69
instead of confronting
the smoker,


584
0:26:33,69 --> 0:26:34,57
had said to the large woman,


585
0:26:34,57 --> 0:26:36,572
"what's the matter with you,
you fat pig?


586
0:26:36,572 --> 0:26:39,75
"don't you know how dangerous
it is to be so overweight?


587

"Stop eating, for god's sake.
And don't you dare get dessert,


588

and what's the matter with you?"


589
0:26:43,58 --> 0:26:45,81
Same logic.


590
0:26:45,81 --> 0:26:47,584
Iíd be hard-pressed
to find a distinction


591
0:26:47,584 --> 0:26:49,585
between those two examples.


592
0:26:49,585 --> 0:26:52,89
So, one is now
socially acceptable --


593
0:26:52,89 --> 0:26:54,9
to hector smokers --


594
0:26:54,9 --> 0:26:57,94
but the other one
isn't quite yet.


595
0:26:57,94 --> 0:26:58,594
So the question is,


596
0:26:58,594 --> 0:27:0,597
at what point
will it become acceptable


597
0:27:0,597 --> 0:27:3,599
to publicly hector fat people


598
0:27:3,599 --> 0:27:7,604
in the way that smokers
are publicly hectored?


599
0:27:7,604 --> 0:27:11,608
A secret study
by one of the tobacco companies


600
0:27:11,608 --> 0:27:15,111

something like,

0:27:15,111 --> 0:27:19,116
"brand imprinting

the little toy cigarettes,

play-smoking them

605
0:27:27,123 --> 0:27:29,625

notice the pack.

If you asked them
what pack it was,

they wouldn't notice it,


608
0:27:33,129 --> 0:27:36,132
but the theory was that
somewhere, it's buried in here,


609
0:27:36,132 --> 0:27:39,135
and then when they get to
the age where they're smoking,


610
0:27:39,135 --> 0:27:40,136
without even realizing it,


611
0:27:40,136 --> 0:27:42,639
they're going for that pack
that they recognize


612
0:27:42,639 --> 0:27:45,142

by eating more ice cream.

You can see how the vicious
cycle would take place.

for me was my uncle,

Burt Baskin, my dad's partner
and brother-in-law,


750
0:34:26,826 --> 0:34:29,579

died of a heart attack.

about 240 pounds --

754
0:34:36,84 --> 0:34:39,589
And when he died,
as a young man, I asked my dad,


755
0:34:39,589 --> 0:34:42,592
"Do you think
there could be a connection


756
0:34:42,592 --> 0:34:44,92
between his fatal heart attack


757
0:34:44,92 --> 0:34:46,595
and the amount
of ice cream he would eat?"

"No, his ticker just got tired

he had sold more ice cream


761

than any human being that had
ever lived on this planet.


762
0:34:56,104 --> 0:34:58,608
He didn't want to think that
the product was hurting anybody,


763
0:34:58,608 --> 0:35:0,609
that it had contributed
to the death


764

and, in many ways, best friend.

0:41:45,38 --> 0:41:47,382
As soon as I got my first car,


929
0:41:47,382 --> 0:41:49,884
this is the first place
I came to.


930
0:41:49,884 --> 0:41:53,388
I bought three Big Macs,
ate them out there.


931
0:41:53,388 --> 0:41:54,889
I enjoyed them so much,


932
0:41:54,889 --> 0:41:57,893
I came back about 5:00 at night,
bought three more,


933
0:41:57,893 --> 0:41:59,394
ate them out there,


934
0:41:59,394 --> 0:42:1,897
came back around 11:00
before they closed,


935
0:42:1,897 --> 0:42:3,398
and ate three more,


936
0:42:3,398 --> 0:42:6,401
so the first day I came here,
I ate nine Big Macs,


937
0:42:6,401 --> 0:42:10,406
and it was like I couldn't get
enough hamburger at that time,


938
0:42:10,406 --> 0:42:11,906
and Big Macs are so good,


939
0:42:11,906 --> 0:42:15,41
so I ate 265
in the first month.


940
0:42:15,41 --> 0:42:17,913
MORGAN: How many do you eat
a day, usually?


941
0:42:17,913 --> 0:42:19,414
Usually it's two a day.


942
0:42:19,414 --> 0:42:21,917
Now, last year,
I ate 741 last year.


943
0:42:21,917 --> 0:42:23,418
That's more than two a day,


944
0:42:23,418 --> 0:42:25,421
so that means
there's days I had three,


945
0:42:25,421 --> 0:42:27,422
but that's because
they're getting smaller.


946
0:42:27,422 --> 0:42:32,927
Probably 90% of my solid diet
is probably Big Macs.


947
0:42:32,927 --> 0:42:33,928
That parking spot,


948
0:42:33,928 --> 0:42:36,431
that's where I asked her
if she wanted to get married.


949
0:42:36,431 --> 0:42:38,434
This place is special --
a lot of reasons.


950
0:42:38,434 --> 0:42:41,437
I had one whopper
in my life -- 1984.


951
0:42:41,437 --> 0:42:44,44
A guy gave me 5 bucks
to eat a whopper.


952
0:42:44,44 --> 0:42:45,94
After I ate the whopper,


953
0:42:45,94 --> 0:42:49,945
took my 5 bucks over to
McDonald's, got some Big Macs.


954
0:42:49,945 --> 0:42:51,947
I always make fun
of people at work.


955
0:42:51,947 --> 0:42:53,448
They say, "I'm gaining weight."


956
0:42:53,448 --> 0:42:55,951
I say, "well, you should
try the Gorske diet."


957
0:42:55,951 --> 0:42:57,952
they don't like that.


958
0:42:57,952 --> 0:43:0,455
This is a perfect sandwich,
you know.


959
0:43:0,455 --> 0:43:1,456
At least for me, it is.

MORGAN: There it is --
bite number 19,000.

GORSKE: The wife says when she's
got to put them in a blender,


962
0:43:7,463 --> 0:43:8,463
it ends.


963
0:43:8,463 --> 0:43:9,465

It's been franchised out.


969
0:43:27,482 --> 0:43:28,983
It's like one of those
"Flintstones" cartoons


970
0:43:28,983 --> 0:43:31,487
where they just had something
rolling in the background.


971
0:43:31,487 --> 0:43:33,489
You kept seeing
the same buildings go by.


972
0:43:33,489 --> 0:43:35,491
It's like
K-Mart, Wal-Mart, McDonald's,


973
0:43:35,491 --> 0:43:36,991
K-Mart, Wal-Mart,
Wendy's, K-Mart.


974
0:43:36,991 --> 0:43:39,995
And it's like you have no sense
of where you're at anymore.


975
0:43:39,995 --> 0:43:41,997
The way I look at it
is Cezanne was inspired


976
0:43:41,997 --> 0:43:43,998
by the mountain he saw
out his window,


977
0:43:43,998 --> 0:43:46,502
and when I look out my window,
I see no mountains.


978
0:43:46,502 --> 0:43:49,505
I just see billboards
and advertisements,


979
0:43:49,505 --> 0:43:52,6
so I use that as my inspiration.


980
0:43:52,6 --> 0:43:54,8
The average American child


981
0:43:54,8 --> 0:43:57,512
sees 10,000 food advertisements
per year on television.


982
0:43:57,512 --> 0:43:59,515
95% of those
are for sugared cereals,


983
0:43:59,515 --> 0:44:2,518

fast foods, or candy.


984

every meal every day

with their child

compelling nutrition message


987

and can bring in cartoon
characters and Michael Jordan --


988
0:44:13,528 --> 0:44:15,3
so instead
of selling McDonald's,


989
0:44:15,3 --> 0:44:16,531
he sells oranges --


990
0:44:16,531 --> 0:44:19,284
and Britney spears,
instead of selling Pepsi


991
0:44:19,284 --> 0:44:22,36
will sell radishes
or lettuce or something --


992
0:44:22,36 --> 0:44:25,39
that parents will have
1,000 cracks at their child,


993
0:44:25,39 --> 0:44:27,542
compared to 10,000
for the food industry.


994
0:44:27,542 --> 0:44:29,43
So it's not a fair fight.

are able to speak,

0:49:12,294 --> 0:49:14,295
and then we found it.


1111
0:49:14,295 --> 0:49:16,297
Behind here --
you'd never see it.


1112
0:49:16,297 --> 0:49:17,299
It's right back there.


1113
0:49:17,299 --> 0:49:18,8
You can't argue


1114
0:49:18,8 --> 0:49:21,804
that people should exercise
personal responsibility


1115
0:49:21,804 --> 0:49:24,807
and then not give them
the information


1116
0:49:24,807 --> 0:49:26,307
on which to base it.


1117
0:49:26,307 --> 0:49:27,308
I got my chicken group.


1118
0:49:27,308 --> 0:49:28,81
ALEX:
There's no chicken group.


1119
0:49:28,81 --> 0:49:30,312
That's my cholesterol group.


1120
0:49:30,312 --> 0:49:31,813
It's protein.


1121
0:49:31,813 --> 0:49:33,314
I got my protein group.


1122
0:49:33,314 --> 0:49:34,315
Carbohydrates.


1123
0:49:34,315 --> 0:49:35,316
I got my meat group.


1124
0:49:35,316 --> 0:49:40,321
You got meat, meat,
sugar, and fat.


1125
0:49:40,321 --> 0:49:43,325
I officially had to loosen
my belt the other day.


1126
0:49:43,325 --> 0:49:44,827
I had to go a notch lower.


1127
0:49:44,827 --> 0:49:46,329
One notch?


1128
0:49:46,329 --> 0:49:47,829
It was scary.


1129
0:49:47,829 --> 0:49:49,831
Iím an old pro at this now.


1130
0:49:49,831 --> 0:49:52,333
You'll get sick of this, too,
though.


1131
0:49:52,333 --> 0:49:54,336
Your girlfriend
must be loving you.


1132
0:49:54,336 --> 0:49:55,337
She hates me.


1133
0:49:55,337 --> 0:49:56,838
[ BOTH LAUGH ]


1134
0:49:56,838 --> 0:49:58,339
Thank you. Bye-bye.


1135
0:49:58,339 --> 0:50:1,343
I averaged out all the calories
for the last nine days,


1136
0:50:1,343 --> 0:50:3,845
and you're still eating


1137
0:50:3,845 --> 0:50:6,849
over 200%
of what your needs are.


1138
0:50:6,849 --> 0:50:9,352
I suggest you cut out
all the liquids


1139
0:50:9,352 --> 0:50:11,854
that you're drinking
from McDonald's,


1140
0:50:11,854 --> 0:50:13,354
except for water.


1141
0:50:13,354 --> 0:50:15,356
A lot of people,
if they're obese,


1142
0:50:15,356 --> 0:50:17,359
and they lose 10%
of their body weight,


1143
0:50:17,359 --> 0:50:18,86
it's beneficial.


1144
0:50:18,86 --> 0:50:21,864
It can be beneficial in terms
of blood pressure and so on,


1145
0:50:21,864 --> 0:50:24,867
so gaining 10%
of your body weight


1146
0:50:24,867 --> 0:50:27,87
maybe could be
equally non-beneficial.


1147
0:50:27,87 --> 0:50:31,873
Here we go.
Second weigh-in.


1148
0:50:31,873 --> 0:50:33,875
What do you think, Eric?
203?


1149
0:50:33,875 --> 0:50:34,876
About 202, 203.


1150
0:50:34,876 --> 0:50:37,88
I think you almost got 10%
of your body weight gained,


1151
0:50:37,88 --> 0:50:41,883
so you've pretty much gained 17 pounds


1152
0:50:41,883 --> 0:50:42,884
in 12 days.


1153
0:50:42,884 --> 0:50:44,886
You better slow down.


1154
0:50:44,886 --> 0:50:47,389
Iím telling you,
don't drink your calories.


1155
0:50:47,389 --> 0:50:48,89
I told him no more shakes,


1156
0:50:48,89 --> 0:50:50,892
no more coke,
no more double burgers.


1157
0:50:50,892 --> 0:50:53,394
The staff here's
calling you "burger boy."


1158
0:50:53,394 --> 0:50:55,397
It's starting to get
dangerous now, man.


1159
0:50:55,397 --> 0:50:56,898
Iím getting
nervous for you.


1160
0:50:56,898 --> 0:50:59,901
The one place where the impact
of our fast-food world


1161
0:50:59,901 --> 0:51:2,905
has become more and more evident
is in our nation's schools.


1162
0:51:2,905 --> 0:52:18,98
Can I get a shot
of your lunch right there?


1163
0:52:18,98 --> 0:52:21,483
this is where schools
turn a blind eye.


1164
0:52:21,483 --> 0:52:22,984
The student
with the French fries


1165
0:52:22,984 --> 0:52:24,986
probably brought a bag lunch
with real food.


1166
0:52:24,986 --> 0:52:25,987
The girl with the chips


1167
0:52:25,987 --> 0:52:27,489
is probably sharing them
with someone else.


1168
0:52:27,489 --> 0:53:6,27
Out of sight, out of mind.


1169
0:53:6,27 --> 0:53:8,53
MORGAN: Barbara brown
is the field representative


1170
0:53:8,53 --> 0:53:11,33
for Sodexho, one of
the countless lowest bidders


1171
0:53:11,33 --> 0:53:13,35
that school districts
have farmed out


1172
0:53:13,35 --> 0:53:15,36
the feeding of your children to.


1173
0:53:15,36 --> 0:53:18,39
Sodexho services more than
400 k-12 school districts


1174
0:53:18,39 --> 0:53:19,54
nationwide every day,


1175
0:53:19,54 --> 0:53:23,44
providing quality food like
little Debbie snack cakes,


1176
0:53:23,44 --> 0:53:25,47
Gatorade, and candy bars
to your children.


1177
0:53:25,47 --> 0:53:26,547
They also operate prisons


1178
0:53:26,547 --> 0:53:29,5
and feed thousands
of inmates worldwide.


1179
0:53:29,5 --> 0:53:33,555
BROWN: Part of our position
is that we're hoping


1180
0:53:33,555 --> 0:53:35,556
that through
nutrition education,


1181
0:53:35,556 --> 0:53:39,61
the students will learn
to make the right food choices


1182
0:53:39,61 --> 0:53:44,565
without restricting
what they can purchase.


1183
0:53:44,565 --> 0:53:47,319
MORGAN: At this middle school
in Beckley, west Virginia,


1184
0:53:47,319 --> 0:53:50,72
the school lunches don't have
the flair they do in Illinois.


1185
0:53:50,72 --> 0:53:52,573
This school does not outsource
their food service,


1186
0:53:52,573 --> 0:53:55,327
but they are on the federal
school lunch program,


1187
0:53:55,327 --> 0:53:58,79
providing USDA reimbursable
meals to the students,


1188
0:53:58,79 --> 0:54:1,333
most of which are reheated,
reconstituted packaged foods.


1189
0:54:1,333 --> 0:54:4,586
Some days the amount of calories
in each meal tops 1,000.


1190
0:54:4,586 --> 0:54:7,89
MORGAN: So, the USDA
sends this food


1191
0:54:7,89 --> 0:54:9,9
for you
to prepare for kids.


1192
0:54:9,9 --> 0:54:11,92
GLOVER: Right.
Well, not all of it, now.


1193
0:54:11,92 --> 0:54:16,697
You've got sloppy Joe
bar-b-que sauce with pork.


1194
0:54:16,697 --> 0:54:17,765
From the government.


1195
0:54:17,765 --> 0:54:20,267
Whatever happened to cooks
actually cooking?


1196
0:54:20,267 --> 0:54:23,27
I don't know what happened.
Too many whiny people.


1197
0:54:23,27 --> 0:54:24,772
They don't want
to work hard.


1198
0:54:24,772 --> 0:54:26,273
It's easy to come in here.


1199
0:54:26,273 --> 0:54:28,777
This is the best tool
we got right here --


1200
0:54:28,777 --> 0:54:30,277
box opener.


1201
0:54:30,277 --> 0:54:32,78
That's your chef's tool,
the box cutter.


1202
0:54:32,78 --> 0:54:35,282
Open up a box, serve it,
give it to them.


1203
0:54:35,282 --> 0:54:37,786
Let's look at the things
that are actually cooked.


1204
0:54:37,786 --> 0:54:39,288
Here's a menu.


1205
0:54:39,288 --> 0:54:40,788
Mashed potatoes.


1206
0:54:40,788 --> 0:54:42,79
Ham.
Chili will be homemade.


1207
0:54:42,79 --> 0:54:44,542
The chili
will be homemade.


1208
0:54:44,542 --> 0:54:46,294
What about
the tomato soup?


1209
0:54:46,294 --> 0:54:47,795
Campbellís.


1210
0:54:47,795 --> 0:54:48,796
Meatballs?


1211
0:54:48,796 --> 0:54:50,798
Comes in a box.
You heat it up.


1212
0:54:50,798 --> 0:54:52,801
Out of the course
of an entire month,


1213
0:54:52,801 --> 0:54:55,803
6 out of 36.


1214
0:54:55,803 --> 0:54:58,556
You're only cooking
6 out of 36 meals?


1215
0:54:58,556 --> 0:55:1,809
Appleton central
alternative high school


1216
0:55:1,809 --> 0:55:4,813
is filled with students who have
truancy and behavioral problems.


1217
0:55:4,813 --> 0:55:6,814
But they've turned
things around --


1218
0:55:6,814 --> 0:55:9,567
not through discipline,
but through diet.


1219
0:55:9,567 --> 0:55:12,319
We were fortunate
to kind of stumble across


1220
0:55:12,319 --> 0:55:16,74
this healthy program
as a result of some contact


1221
0:55:16,74 --> 0:55:20,327
with natural oven and bakery
of Manitowoc Wisconsin,


1222
0:55:20,327 --> 0:55:23,832
and they believe
in low-fat, low-sugar,


1223
0:55:23,832 --> 0:55:26,834
non-chemically processed foods


1224
0:55:26,834 --> 0:55:29,838
that are free of dyes
and preservatives,


1225
0:55:29,838 --> 0:55:32,339
full of whole grains,


1226
0:55:32,339 --> 0:55:35,342
a lot of fresh fruits
and vegetables.


1227
0:55:35,342 --> 0:55:36,844
We do no beef here at all,


1228
0:55:36,844 --> 0:55:38,847
and then it's the method
of preparation,


1229
0:55:38,847 --> 0:55:40,347
where we don't fry.


1230
0:55:40,347 --> 0:55:43,351
A lot of baking
and then just fresh preparation,


1231
0:55:43,351 --> 0:55:45,352
as opposed to opening cans


1232
0:55:45,352 --> 0:55:47,354
or thawing things out
from the box.


1233
0:55:47,354 --> 0:55:50,357
We got rid of candy machines,
soda machines,


1234
0:55:50,357 --> 0:55:53,361
brought in bottled water,
and it was just a situation


1235
0:55:53,361 --> 0:55:56,363
where we saw a major change in the kids.


1236
0:55:56,363 --> 0:55:58,866
If you walk through these halls,
and you're here,


1237
0:55:58,866 --> 0:56:1,869
these do not look like at-risk,
out-of-control kids.


1238
0:56:1,869 --> 0:56:3,872
Their behaviors are better.


1239
0:56:3,872 --> 0:56:5,874
They seem to be more focused.


1240
0:56:5,874 --> 0:56:7,374
Teachers will tell you


1241
0:56:7,374 --> 0:56:10,377
that they get more
out of them in the class.


1242
0:56:10,377 --> 0:56:12,88
MORGAN: Keep in mind,
this is not a private school.


1243
0:56:12,88 --> 0:56:16,384
These are the "trouble kids"
of the public school system


1244
0:56:16,384 --> 0:56:19,387
in Appleton, Wisconsin,
that are eating so well.


1245
0:56:19,387 --> 0:56:20,888
and it costs about the same


1246
0:56:20,888 --> 0:56:23,39
as any other
school lunch program.


1247
0:56:23,39 --> 0:56:26,393
So my question is --
why isn't everyone doing this?


1248
0:56:26,393 --> 0:56:28,396
There's an awful lot
of resistance


1249
0:56:28,396 --> 0:56:30,898
from the junk food companies


1250
0:56:30,898 --> 0:56:33,401
that make huge profits off
schools at the present time.


1251
0:56:33,401 --> 0:56:36,404
They don't want to get kicked
out of the school system.


1252
0:56:36,404 --> 0:56:39,907
They want to be there
to addict the children for life.


1253
0:56:39,907 --> 0:56:41,91
The soft drink companies,
especially, boast about


1254
0:56:41,91 --> 0:56:44,411
how they're contributing
to America's education,


1255
0:56:44,411 --> 0:56:45,913
but, in fact, what they're doing


1256
0:56:45,913 --> 0:56:47,915
is they're draining money
from the community


1257
0:56:47,915 --> 0:56:49,918
rather than contributing money
to the community


1258
0:56:49,918 --> 0:56:51,418
because the soft drink companies


1259
0:56:51,418 --> 0:56:53,421
aren't pumping those dollars
into the machines.


1260
0:56:53,421 --> 0:56:55,422
It's the children
in the community


1261
0:56:55,422 --> 0:56:57,424
who are getting the money
from their parents,


1262
0:56:57,424 --> 0:56:59,928
and instead of that money
going directly to education,


1263
0:56:59,928 --> 0:57:2,43
the soft drink companies
are taking a cut of it


1264
0:57:2,43 --> 0:57:5,183
and walking away rich
as a consequence.


1265
0:57:5,183 --> 0:57:8,435
We just banned soda
in our school district,


1266
0:57:8,435 --> 0:57:12,941
and the sugar here shows you how
much sugar a student will drink


1267
0:57:12,941 --> 0:57:14,942
in a week of just soda.


1268
0:57:14,942 --> 0:57:16,944
Forget about
the rest of the food they eat.


1269
0:57:16,944 --> 0:57:21,449
And some of these companies
are really opposing the ban


1270
0:57:21,449 --> 0:57:24,953
for reasons of
that we would lose revenue.


1271
0:57:24,953 --> 0:57:26,455
And it's not about money.


1272
0:57:26,455 --> 0:57:28,455
It's not about economics.


1273
0:57:28,455 --> 0:57:32,459
It's about health.


1274
0:57:32,459 --> 0:57:33,46
Ooh.


1275
0:57:33,46 --> 0:57:38,466
The McDonald's
Texas home-style burger meal.


1276
0:57:38,466 --> 0:57:40,969
That's a --
that's a local specialty.


1277
0:57:40,969 --> 0:57:43,47
So it's kind of like
a big 'n' tasty?


1278
0:57:43,47 --> 0:57:46,474
Yes, except the big 'n' tasty
comes with mayonnaise.


1279
0:57:46,474 --> 0:57:47,474
Oh, then, you know what?


1280
0:57:47,474 --> 0:57:51,479
I need the McDonald's Texas
homestyle burger meal, please.


1281
0:57:51,479 --> 0:57:54,482
Would you like
to super-size it today?


1282
0:57:54,482 --> 0:57:55,983
Oh, yes, I would.


1283
0:57:55,983 --> 0:57:57,986
Do a lot of people
super-size it?


1284
0:57:57,986 --> 0:57:59,486
Yes.


1285
0:57:59,486 --> 0:58:2,49
Say you asked five people.
How many of those five do it?


1286
0:58:2,49 --> 0:58:4,491
Actually,
I get mostly all of them.


1287
0:58:4,491 --> 0:58:7,495
Mostly all of them?
So you're batting about 100%?


1288
0:58:7,495 --> 0:58:8,996
I guess.


1289

My body ...officially hates me.


1477
1:6:3,804 --> 1:6:6,306
All the vitamins
that you see here --


1478
1:6:6,306 --> 1:6:10,31
vitamin e, thiamin,
riboflavin, niacin, and so on --


1479
1:6:10,31 --> 1:6:12,813
are all under 50%
of what you need.


1480
1:6:12,813 --> 1:6:15,315
You're getting
quite a lot of carbohydrates,


1481
1:6:15,315 --> 1:6:19,57
and I know, clearly, that those
are all refined carbohydrates


1482
1:6:19,57 --> 1:6:23,825
because those are coming from
the buns, biscuits, hashbrowns.


1483
1:6:23,825 --> 1:6:25,325
And the sugar --


1484
1:6:25,325 --> 1:6:28,79
let's not forget the most
refined carbohydrate of all,


1485
1:6:28,79 --> 1:6:30,832
which is coming from your
milkshakes and your coke.


1486
1:6:30,832 --> 1:6:33,333
MORGAN: In fact,
there are only seven items


1487
1:6:33,333 --> 1:6:36,838
on the McDonald's menu that
contain no sugar whatsoever --


1488
1:6:36,838 --> 1:6:40,841
French fries, chicken McNuggets,
hashbrowns, sausage,


1489
1:6:40,841 --> 1:6:43,343
diet coke, coffee, and iced tea.


1490
1:6:43,343 --> 1:6:48,349

the salads -- contain sugar.

Muscle weighs more than fat.


1495
1:6:55,856 --> 1:6:58,86
You might have lost some muscle
mass and gained some fat mass.

Sick and unhappy.

The headaches might even be
hypertensive headaches,


1507

but they're probably not.


1508
1:7:42,402 --> 1:7:45,406
They're probably
related to blood sugar.


1509
1:7:45,406 --> 1:7:48,409
You might be in
this hyperinsulinemic state.


1510
1:7:48,409 --> 1:7:53,413
150 over 110.


1511
1:7:53,413 --> 1:7:56,416
Your total cholesterol

1512
1:7:56,416 --> 1:7:57,918
Now it's 225.


1513
1:7:57,918 --> 1:8:1,923
A liver that's inflamed
in any way or sick in any way


1514
1:8:1,923 --> 1:8:5,927
will leak some of its enzymes
out to the blood.


1515
1:8:5,927 --> 1:8:8,43
So this
is very nonspecific,


1516
1:8:8,43 --> 1:8:10,931
but it means
the liver is sick,


1517
1:8:10,931 --> 1:8:13,434
and the most likely cause
of your liver sickness


1518
1:8:13,434 --> 1:8:15,435
is a fatty liver.


1519

Anybody would say right now
that you're sick.


1526
1:8:37,457 --> 1:8:39,21
If you're
fatigued with this,


1527
1:8:39,21 --> 1:8:41,337
you'll feel
lethargic with this,


1528
1:8:41,337 --> 1:8:43,463
you'll feel
run-down with this.


1529
1:8:43,463 --> 1:8:46,217
If somebody were doing this
to their liver with alcohol,


1530
1:8:46,217 --> 1:8:49,469
they could theoretically
wipe out all the liver cells


1531
1:8:49,469 --> 1:8:51,471
and they'd be
in liver failure.


1532
1:8:51,471 --> 1:8:55,226
Iíve never heard of anybody
doing this to their liver


1533

And I won't wipe out my liver
in two more weeks?


1540
1:9:10,491 --> 1:9:12,744
I would think
it would be unlikely.

I don't want to tell you
you wouldn't.


1542
1:9:14,995 --> 1:9:17,999
My advice to you is
to stop doing what you're doing,


1543
1:9:17,999 --> 1:9:19,499
because it's hurting you.


1544

You're sick,
and you're making yourself sick,


1545
1:9:22,3 --> 1:9:24,504
and you can
make yourself unsick


1546
1:9:24,504 --> 1:9:26,757
by stopping doing
what you're doing.


1547
1:9:26,757 --> 1:9:29,509
Iím just afraid
there will be something


1548
1:9:29,509 --> 1:9:31,511
that's totally irreversible,


1549
1:9:31,511 --> 1:9:34,515
that there will be
some damage done that...

- Yeah.
- I don't know.

once you change your habits

1:9:41,22 --> 1:9:44,24
that that's
going to correct itself.


1553
1:9:44,24 --> 1:9:48,28
They think that everything
should get back on track

and your liver heals itself.

Well, if you need a portion
of my liver, honey,


1558

There's a drug that is used in
emergency rooms called Naloxone.


1562
1:10:15,89 --> 1:10:17,891
It's used for heroin overdose.


1563
1:10:17,891 --> 1:10:20,894
A guy comes in

1564

He's gonna die.


1565
1:10:21,895 --> 1:10:23,897
You inject him with this drug,


1566
1:10:23,897 --> 1:10:26,9
and it blocks the opiate
receptors in the brain.


1567

Heroin doesn't work.
He wakes up.

you find
the most amazing thing --


1571
1:10:37,41 --> 1:10:39,413
they lose much of their interest
in chocolate.


1572
1:10:39,413 --> 1:10:41,915
They take a bite,
they set it back down.


1573

In other words,
it's not taste and mouth feel.


1574

took out a full-page ad
in a French magazine


1612
1:12:21,14 --> 1:12:24,17

"there is no reason

freaked out, saying that
this is only one opinion,

1:12:31,24 --> 1:12:33,527
and that the vast majority
of nutrition professionals


1617
1:12:33,527 --> 1:12:36,3
say that McDonald's food
can be a part of a healthy diet.


1618

1:31:43,275 --> 1:31:45,528
especially with
what showed up with your liver.


2015
1:31:45,528 --> 1:31:47,78
MORGAN: So I shouldn't eat
this food for a year?


2016
1:31:47,78 --> 1:31:49,281
No, I don't think so.


2017
1:31:49,281 --> 1:31:52,285
We see people
who go on an alcohol binge,


2018
1:31:52,285 --> 1:31:54,786
and their numbers
go up like crazy,


2019
1:31:54,786 --> 1:31:58,29
but to go on a Mac attack...


2020
1:31:58,29 --> 1:32:2,295
and they've got numbers to show
that it attacks your liver, too.


2021
1:32:2,295 --> 1:32:5,797
Honestly, I wouldn't have
even thought about this.


2022
1:32:5,797 --> 1:32:7,299
But it makes sense.


2023
1:32:7,299 --> 1:32:10,553
Now that we have the data,
it definitely makes sense.


2024
1:32:10,553 --> 1:32:13,806
MORGAN: Still, the impact
of this initial lawsuit


2025
1:32:13,806 --> 1:32:15,307
is being seen far and wide.


2026
1:32:15,307 --> 1:32:18,811
School districts in new York,
Texas, and San Francisco


2027
1:32:18,811 --> 1:32:21,313
have banned sugary soft drinks
in schools,


2028
1:32:21,313 --> 1:32:24,816
and all-natural, healthy options
are popping up everywhere.


2029
1:32:24,816 --> 1:32:27,69
McDonaldís joined right in,
sponsoring events


2030
1:32:27,69 --> 1:32:29,447
that showed how health-conscious
they'd become


2031
1:32:29,447 --> 1:32:31,823
and creating a new line
of premium salads.


2032
1:32:31,823 --> 1:32:34,827
At the same time, however,
they also masterminded


2033
1:32:34,827 --> 1:32:37,33
one of their fattest
sandwiches to date --


2034
1:32:37,33 --> 1:32:39,832
the McGriddle,
a pancake-wrapped creation


2035
1:32:39,832 --> 1:32:41,333
that won my heart in Texas


2036
1:32:41,333 --> 1:32:43,835
but can pack as much fat
as a Big Mac


2037
1:32:43,835 --> 1:32:46,589
and have more sugar than a pack
of McDonaldland cookies.


2038
1:32:46,589 --> 1:32:49,342
in fact, their new premium ranch
chicken salad with dressing


2039
1:32:49,342 --> 1:32:51,344
delivers more calories
than a Big Mac


2040
1:32:51,344 --> 1:32:53,345
and 51 grams of fat --


2041
1:32:53,345 --> 1:32:55,848
79% of your daily fat intake.


2042
1:32:55,848 --> 1:32:58,85
Over the course of my McDiet,


2043
1:32:58,85 --> 1:33:1,853
I consumed 30 pounds of sugar
from their food.


2044
1:33:1,853 --> 1:33:2,854
That's a pound a day.


2045
1:33:2,854 --> 1:33:6,358
On top of that,
I also took in 12 pounds of fat.


2046
1:33:6,358 --> 1:33:8,36
Now, I know what you're saying.


2047
1:33:8,36 --> 1:33:11,364
You're saying "nobody's
supposed to eat this food


2048
1:33:11,364 --> 1:33:12,364
"three times a day.


2049
1:33:12,364 --> 1:33:14,867
No wonder all this stuff
happened to you."


2050
1:33:14,867 --> 1:33:16,368
But the scary part is,


2051
1:33:16,368 --> 1:33:19,372
there are people
who eat this food regularly.


2052
1:33:19,372 --> 1:33:21,373
Some people
even eat it every day.


2053
1:33:21,373 --> 1:33:24,377
So while my experiment
may have been a little extreme,


2054
1:33:24,377 --> 1:33:26,378
it's not that crazy.


2055
1:33:26,378 --> 1:33:28,38
But here is a crazy idea --


2056
1:33:28,38 --> 1:33:31,383
why not do away
with your super size options?


2057
1:33:31,383 --> 1:33:35,387
Who needs 42 ounces of coke,
a half-pound of fries?


2058
1:33:35,387 --> 1:33:37,389
and why not give me a choice


2059
1:33:37,389 --> 1:33:39,892
besides French fries
or French fries?


2060
1:33:39,892 --> 1:33:41,393
that would be a great start.


2061
1:33:41,393 --> 1:33:44,396
But why should these companies
want to change?


2062
1:33:44,396 --> 1:33:46,899
Their loyalty isn't to you.
It's to the stockholders.


2063
1:33:46,899 --> 1:33:49,402
The bottom line --
they're a business,


2064
1:33:49,402 --> 1:33:50,902
no matter what they say.


2065
1:33:50,902 --> 1:33:54,907
And by selling you unhealthy
food, they make millions,


2066
1:33:54,907 --> 1:33:57,409
and no company
wants to stop doing that.


2067
1:33:57,409 --> 1:33:59,912
If this ever-growing paradigm
is going to shift,


2068
1:33:59,912 --> 1:34:1,413
it's up to you.


2069
1:34:1,413 --> 1:34:4,916
But if you decide to keep
living this way, go ahead.


2070
1:34:4,916 --> 1:34:7,92
Over time, you may find yourself
getting as sick as I did,


2071
1:34:7,92 --> 1:34:9,422
and you may wind up here...


2072
1:34:9,422 --> 1:34:10,922
or here.


2073
1:34:10,922 --> 1:34:12,924
I guess the big question is --


2074
1:34:12,924 --> 1:34:25,937
who do you want to see go first,
you or them?


2075
1:34:25,937 --> 1:34:29,191
Right now, you have the urge
to eat something.


2076
1:34:29,191 --> 1:34:32,445
When it's through,
if you still want to eat,


2077
1:34:32,445 --> 1:34:34,947
then you're probably
really hungry.


2078
1:34:34,947 --> 1:34:36,948
Think about what I'm saying.


2079
1:34:36,948 --> 1:34:38,701
# F.a.c., that is me


2080
1:34:38,701 --> 1:34:40,952

# I was loose, I was free


2083
1:34:44,206 --> 1:34:45,957
# Then I waited in the line


2084
1:34:45,957 --> 1:34:47,46
# For some burgers
and some fries


2085
1:34:47,46 --> 1:34:49,461
# Super size, that'd be nice


2086
1:34:49,461 --> 1:34:50,963
# Take a bite
and close your eyes


2087
1:34:50,963 --> 1:34:52,964
# Round two, what do I do?


2088
1:34:52,964 --> 1:34:54,466

2090
1:34:56,218 --> 1:34:57,845
