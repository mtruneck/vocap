0:0:1,11 --> 0:0:3,17
STEVE SPANGLER: My
hand is freezing.


3
0:0:3,17 --> 0:0:6,71
How do whales stay in ocean
water that's this cold?


4
0:0:6,71 --> 0:0:10,13
Which got me to thinking, why is
there a tub of lard sitting


5
0:0:10,13 --> 0:0:14,54
right here and how does it
relate to this ice water?


6
0:0:14,54 --> 0:0:15,97
I have no idea.


7
0:0:15,97 --> 0:0:17,87
But I have about 30 seconds
to figure it out


8
0:0:17,87 --> 0:0:19,74
while you watch this.


9
0:0:19,74 --> 0:0:23,15
I'm Steve Spangler, and I'm all
about making science fun.


10
0:0:23,15 --> 0:0:26,14
For the last 20 years, I've
been teaching ways to turn


11
0:0:26,14 --> 0:0:29,16
ordinary science experiments
into unforgettable


12
0:0:29,16 --> 0:0:30,17
experiences.


13
0:0:30,17 --> 0:0:32,81
I have an amazing team who will
do whatever it takes to


14
0:0:32,81 --> 0:0:35,14
affect the way people
think about science.


15
0:0:35,14 --> 0:0:37,83
And to do that, I live
in one motto--


16
0:0:37,83 --> 0:0:40,85
make it big, do it right,
give it class.


17
0:0:40,85 --> 0:0:46,3



18
0:0:46,3 --> 0:0:47,31
So here's the challenge
I have for you.


19
0:0:47,31 --> 0:0:50,17
Get a bucket, get some water,
get some ice-- not any kind of


20
0:0:50,17 --> 0:0:52,205
ice, glacial ice.


21
0:0:52,205 --> 0:0:56,59
It's straight from Alaska,
costs $50,000.


22
0:0:56,59 --> 0:0:59,4
If you want extreme cold,
pour some salt in there.


23
0:0:59,4 --> 0:1:2,12
It'll drop the temperature to
about 17 degrees Fahrenheit.


24
0:1:2,12 --> 0:1:5,47
Then plunge your hand into the
water like this and see how


25
0:1:5,47 --> 0:1:6,67
long you can keep it there.


26
0:1:6,67 --> 0:1:7,9
You don't want to stick
your hand in?


27
0:1:7,9 --> 0:1:9,35
Get a friend like
Higginsworth.


28
0:1:9,35 --> 0:1:9,83
See?


29
0:1:9,83 --> 0:1:11,8
Higginsworth, put
your hand in.


30
0:1:11,8 --> 0:1:12,65
Now leave it there
for a long time.


31
0:1:12,65 --> 0:1:13,84
See, this got me to thinking--


32
0:1:13,84 --> 0:1:16,79
how is it that whales can stay
in this incredibly cold


33
0:1:16,79 --> 0:1:17,32
temperatures?


34
0:1:17,32 --> 0:1:20,44
Well, the answer is all the
blubber that's around them.


35
0:1:20,44 --> 0:1:23,39
So we're going to create
ourselves a little blubber bag


36
0:1:23,39 --> 0:1:24,66
that will allow you to
be able to stay in


37
0:1:24,66 --> 0:1:25,81
the water for hours.


38
0:1:25,81 --> 0:1:29,4
So how you doing now,
Higginsworth?


39
0:1:29,4 --> 0:1:30,6
See, kids?


40
0:1:30,6 --> 0:1:31,37
He tapped out.


41
0:1:31,37 --> 0:1:33,89
You'll always do better
than Higginsworth.


42
0:1:33,89 --> 0:1:35,96
See, I'm not the only one
thinking about whales.


43
0:1:35,96 --> 0:1:38,45
A hundred science enthusiasts
joined us for an experience


44
0:1:38,45 --> 0:1:39,79
called Science at Sea.


45
0:1:39,79 --> 0:1:42,56
It was a cruise to Alaska with
Holland America, where we got


46
0:1:42,56 --> 0:1:44,98
to see whales breaching and ice
calving and some of the


47
0:1:44,98 --> 0:1:47,25
most amazing things in Alaska.


48
0:1:47,25 --> 0:1:49,88
The naturalists are the ones
that pointed out this quick


49
0:1:49,88 --> 0:1:52,54
little demonstration that you
can do with vegetable


50
0:1:52,54 --> 0:1:55,87
shortening, a Ziploc bag, and
some duct tape to understand


51
0:1:55,87 --> 0:1:59,17
how whales withstand these
incredible temperatures.


52
0:1:59,17 --> 0:2:2,39
Step one, find yourself that
vegetable shortening and put


53
0:2:2,39 --> 0:2:4,37
it inside of a Ziploc bag.


54
0:2:4,37 --> 0:2:5,93
So you're going to try to get
it down inside this little


55
0:2:5,93 --> 0:2:7,135
Ziploc bag.


56
0:2:7,135 --> 0:2:11,39
You've just got to try to keep
it away from the little top


57
0:2:11,39 --> 0:2:13,89
here so that it doesn't get
real greasy at the top.


58
0:2:13,89 --> 0:2:15,73
You're going to want to put
three or four really good


59
0:2:15,73 --> 0:2:17,72
scoops in the Ziploc bag.


60
0:2:17,72 --> 0:2:19,25
See, all this vegetable
shortening is going to


61
0:2:19,25 --> 0:2:20,5
simulate the blubber.


62
0:2:20,5 --> 0:2:22,83



63
0:2:22,83 --> 0:2:23,6
Right.


64
0:2:23,6 --> 0:2:24,36
Now you take the second bag.


65
0:2:24,36 --> 0:2:28,15
This is the bag that your hand
will go in and stay clean.


66
0:2:28,15 --> 0:2:33,32
And this now goes into the first
bag with all of that


67
0:2:33,32 --> 0:2:35,72
vegetable shortening.


68
0:2:35,72 --> 0:2:37,42
Flatten it out.


69
0:2:37,42 --> 0:2:39,42
Push it down.


70
0:2:39,42 --> 0:2:43,2
And now you have the start
of a blubber bag.


71
0:2:43,2 --> 0:2:46,91
Once you have all of that
shortening spread out, then


72
0:2:46,91 --> 0:2:49,53
you're going to want to take the
top bag here and actually


73
0:2:49,53 --> 0:2:55,97
fold it inside out, trapping all
of the shortening inside.


74
0:2:55,97 --> 0:2:58,71
And now, to make sure that
nothing comes out you take


75
0:2:58,71 --> 0:3:3,5
some duct tape and
you seal it up.


76
0:3:3,5 --> 0:3:4,652
Perfect.


77
0:3:4,652 --> 0:3:6,25
You got a blubber bag.


78
0:3:6,25 --> 0:3:7,5
Take a look at this.


79
0:3:7,5 --> 0:3:10,11
You see, all of the shortening
is trapped between the two


80
0:3:10,11 --> 0:3:13,68
layers here of plastic bag,
allowing you to put your hand


81
0:3:13,68 --> 0:3:17,15
inside and feel it, yet
it doesn't get dirty.


82
0:3:17,15 --> 0:3:19,37
Remember the challenge at the
very beginning-- how long can


83
0:3:19,37 --> 0:3:20,26
you keep your hand in?


84
0:3:20,26 --> 0:3:23,15
Well, just stick your hand in
the blubber glove and now


85
0:3:23,15 --> 0:3:26,935
plunge it down inside, you
can stay there forever.


86
0:3:26,935 --> 0:3:29,69
It really is very, very
warm down inside.


87
0:3:29,69 --> 0:3:33,28
See, that the layer of fat
really is a great insulator,


88
0:3:33,28 --> 0:3:35,995
keeping the heat in
and the cold out.


89
0:3:35,995 --> 0:3:38,44
You can stay here for
the longest time.


90
0:3:38,44 --> 0:3:41,18
If you've ever heard the term
"barrel of oil," it actually


91
0:3:41,18 --> 0:3:44,1
came from the whaling
industry.


92
0:3:44,1 --> 0:3:46,88
See, whaling was huge and whale
oil was a big deal.


93
0:3:46,88 --> 0:3:49,23
In the early 1800s, they were a
little concerned about what


94
0:3:49,23 --> 0:3:52,15
would happen because the supply
of whales kept on


95
0:3:52,15 --> 0:3:54,48
diminishing until about 1865.


96
0:3:54,48 --> 0:3:58,31
Whales were nearly extinct and
we had to move to petroleum.


97
0:3:58,31 --> 0:4:0,16
Now that you know how these
creatures can withstand these


98
0:4:0,16 --> 0:4:3,56
incredible temperatures, just
imagine seeing them up close.


99
0:4:3,56 --> 0:4:5,25
Well, that's what happened
with a hundred science


100
0:4:5,25 --> 0:4:9,966
enthusiasts as they joined
us for Science at Sea.


101
0:4:9,966 --> 0:7:18,57
[MUSIC PLAYING]


102
0:7:18,57 --> 0:7:21,2
See, using a blubber glove, I
could have my hand in this


103
0:7:21,2 --> 0:7:22,27
water forever.


104
0:7:22,27 --> 0:9:22,27
