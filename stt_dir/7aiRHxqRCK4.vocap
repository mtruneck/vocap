###0 
###6 -Big 'ol Hummer.
###8 
###11 Oh, there's kids skating in there.
###13 
###19 How you doing?
###20 -Pretty good.
###20 -What's your name?
###21 -Jonathan.
###21 -Pretty cool.
###22 Nice to meet you, Jonathan.
###24 -You were skating fast.
###26 I'm like, oh, shit.
###27 It's Daewon.
###28 I saw your "Decker" video.
###30 -Oh, the old one, yeah.
###32 That was a long time ago.
###32 It's crazy that it's so long ago.
###34 That was eight, seven years ago.
###37 Time flies, man.
###39 Take advantage, dude.
###40 -Don't do it.
###41 Don't OK.
###43 -We'll redo the courthouse thing that--
###45 
###50 -People would do lines back then and then after they
###53 viewed the line, people would follow him
###54 like yeah, Start cheering.
###56 -The end of the camera's part you'll see it in
###59 "Goldfish," I think.
###61 Skating has changed in that way a lot, it seems.
###65 It's got so serious.
###68 Now it's huge.
###69 That's good, man.
###70 Just keep skating.
###72 Didn't even like stuff that they do, don't
###75 even worry about it.
###75 Don't ever sweat like, hey, is this good enough or is that
###78 good enough.
###79 As long as you're happy with it, it's fine.
###81 -Yeah, he's not intimidating to be around.
###82 He's cool.
###83 He make you feel like you're hanging out.
###86 -All right.
###86 Welcome back to the show.
###88 This week, I went out to Los Angeles, met
###90 up with Daewon Song.
###92 Daewon brought along Daniel Castillo, and we went to some
###95 of the spots that those guys filmed for the video "Love
###98 Child," which is really kind of trip for me because, I felt
###101 like I went in some time machine and went into this
###103 video that was really important to me as a skater in
###106 the early '90s.
###107 I think "Love Child" marked a change for World Industries
###110 and a change for skateboarding in general.
###112 It was just really different.
###114 It was like these city kids all skating these street
###118 spots, the schoolyards Then like '80s like Santa Cruz
###122 speed wheels kind of skating or like
###124 white kids before they--
###125 I don't know.
###126 We just looked at some spots those guys skated.
###128 And that's all.
###129 This is the Daewon Song episode.
###130 I hope you enjoy it.
###132 -All right.
###132 So I'm trying to think where we should go first.
###134 Seventh Street is an old classic spot, but I think
###137 people have seen enough of that place.
###138 You know what I mean?
###140 The best spots are the ones that just you can't even
###143 believe it, hours and hours of skating went on.
###145 -Could you describe it?
###146 -This is the school like at the end of "Rubbish Heap" when
###150 Rodney's part ends, Jeremy Klein runs and folks just
###154 gives him a street board when he comes out
###155 here and ollies that.
###158 [INAUDIBLE] insane, like pretty crazy to think about,
###161 and he does a couple of other things on the street board.
###163 
###168 -It seem so weird.
###169 It's so big.
###170 Like I watch "Rubbish Heap" and I was like, man.
###174 The World never even interested me whatsoever.
###176 I was more like a Z-boy, Dogtown kind of guy and from
###179 where I grew up.
###180 -Around our neighborhoods, Daniel grew up in a fucked up
###183 part of Culver City, man.
###184 Up at Stoner Boulevard near the projects.
###186 Whew!
###188 -Yeah.
###188 I think definitely if I didn't skate, there would've been a
###191 chance I probably would have done drive-bys.
###195 Oh yeah, I got shot, man.
###197 I was just at a party and wrong place at the wrong time
###200 pretty much.
###201 They thought me and my friends were a bunch
###203 of gangsters, probably.
###205 And they just unloaded on us, like two cars.
###210 But now, I always stay far from that.
###212 And skating is so good for kids that grew up in bad
###217 neighborhoods.
###217 Do you know what I mean?
###218 Because it gets them like psyched on something else
###221 rather than what's going on around them.
###223 
###225 Frescas was my World Industries.
###228 I'm still under the same distribution.
###232 Like where World started is where I'm still at.
###234 It wasn't the first place I've ever gotten where I first got
###237 sponsored and I'm still at the same company.
###240 It's pretty crazy to think about.
###242 Daniel, how old were you?
###244 14?
###245 13?
###245 Yeah.
###246 So I was like 15 or 16.
###251 And I miss those days.
###252 
###259 Like in 92, when they had revamped the whole team like
###262 and like a lot of the guys have been on it took off.
###266 It was like me, Kareem, Shiloh,
###270 Chico, Spencer, Daniel.
###273 That's pretty insane.
###274 -Yeah, like all of the people that were in "Love Child" were
###277 totally city kids.
###280 Me and Kareem used to skate a lot together
###282 when we were younger.
###283 And he was like, yeah, there's some new guy in World
###286 Industries and I was like who?
###288 He was like some dude named Daewon.
###291 And I was like, Daewon?
###293 I was like what nationality is he?
###295 And this is what Kareem said.
###296 Kareem said oh, he's some nigger.
###297 I don't know.
###299 -OK.
###300 You're gonna trip out on this.
###302 First World ad ever.
###304 This is the tail grab one foot, that
###305 first White Power ad.
###307 -Yeah.
###308 We had that first ad together, me, him and Kareem.
###311 It was pretty funny.
###312 Spike Jones actually shot the photos.
###314 It was pretty crazy.
###316 And it probably took like an hour.
###320 It was pretty awesome back then.
###322 -When we got on, Spike was pretty much in charge.
###325 He was the one doing the ads and shooting so, we went over
###327 to Tower Tide.
###328 Daniel did a tail grab one foot Kareem did like a 540 and
###333 what did he do, Daniel?
###334 -A 540 [INAUDIBLE].
###335 -On the same bank?
###336 -Yeah.
###337 -And I had a tail grab shove it.
###338 
###342 No wonder I couldn't pick up any other sponsors.
###345 So it started right here.
###347 -Recreate it exactly.
###348 -Dude, I don't think I could do it again.
###351 -Did you go down the slide in it?
###353 -No.
###354 That was the beginning of the part where I go down the
###356 slide, and then it's like the line after that.
###359 It's right after that.
###361 It's the slide and then right after that is this line where
###364 I do a front pop.
###365 We got to skate through.
###367 So I just see it through.
###368 I'll just tell you what I did.
###369 Is that cool?
###371 
###378 Front paw, a point down there, huge one.
###381 And then my board I did an ollie tre flip.
###384 Back then I didn't know it was an ollie tre flip.
###386 I just thought it was some sort of nollie and then
###388 flinged around.
###389 And then I did the old faithful like back 180 and
###392 then switch 180.
###393 360 ollie over this.
###398 But I landed it.
###400 I did the worst kick flip ever right here.
###403 360 flip right there.
###407 And I went off this bump.
###408 Bump with the manhole was a double flip.
###410 
###412 Then I did a poor excuse for a pop shove it right here.
###417 You can watch it back and go, wow.
###419 That's lame.
###420 Then I was like, oh, it's really coming now.
###422 I'm going to prep up for this.
###423 
###428 And I'll leap up these and just went huge with a switch
###431 540 big flip.
###432 But they didn't get that one, so I just ended up doing a
###434 hill flip shove it.
###436 When I did that line, were there a lot of lines?
###439 I think it would trip people up, because they were like,
###441 are you allowed to do lines long like that?
###444 You know what I mean?
###445 It kind of took a minute to get down to the grand finale.
###448 The heel flip shove it looked terrible.
###449 
###455 "Love Child" was random.
###457 Three tours plus maybe filming for like a month
###461 straight and that's it.
###462 Where now, it's like, oh God.
###464 I gotta film 7 different people.
###465 I hope I can get can get the footage.
###467 Film for a year.
###470 -Did you like it better then?
###471 -I liked it better then.
###472 It seemed more like I was just skating and all of a sudden, I
###474 had a video part.
###477 -Yeah.
###478 I remember being super psyched on the hard flip over this
###482 little gap that he did.
###483 It was super slick looking.
###485 -The worst hard flip ever documented?
###487 -What's so bad about it?
###489 It was the first one ever done.
###491 -It was the first, but it was the worst.
###493 So it's cool.
###494 So it's like first and worst.
###497 Back then too, I didn't even know what it was.
###498 All I know is I had to mule kick the fuck out of my back,
###501 front foot and just move it out of the way.
###503 And if you shot a photo, there would definitely be three
###505 frames of just something that just did not look right.
###510 -But you had never heard of anyone doing that trick?
###512 -No.
###512 You know what?
###513 I actually did here one person who did it.
###515 This guy Dan Gallagher.
###517 Rodney was saying he thinks he did it.
###520 And I'm pretty sure he did do it, but I don't want to give
###522 him full credit.
###523 But who got it on footage first over a huge gap?
###527 You got your fish with you because--
###530 There's borough.
###530 God, they need a gardener.
###533 This was a really popular spot back in like '93.
###538 This place is like one place like it goes way back from
###543 like the "Rubbish Heap" Jeremy Klein days where he came here
###548 and I think, did the best stuff ever.
###550 
###555 -They put a pole at the bottom of the one that everybody used
###558 to skate, and we still skated it.
###560 Jeremy Klein had some stuff in it a long time ago in old
###564 video and then now, they put poles all over, and put those
###568 benches to really just kill it.
###569 -Rick Howard had a bunch of stuff that was good too.
###572 -Rick Howard had a cover switch 360?
###574 -Yeah.
###574 It was on that wall.
###576 Gino actually had like a fakie hard that was amazing and then
###579 this is what we call the vortex, the V. And there was a
###585 lot of stuff they went down here.
###586 Jeremy Klein did some stuff that was, he did like front
###588 side flip in the birdhouse video.
###589 I know he did backside flip.
###592 The main bank that everybody skated was the one right next
###595 that railing.
###597 That's the main one.
###600 If you watch like the old video in "New World Order"
###603 where Daniel is sitting at the top of that bank over there,
###605 and I do some weird trick where I didn't hit my tail.
###609 Hey, everybody did the Howard Hail right there and then you
###611 were talking.
###612 That was the first try but I hit my tail.
###614 That was fucking sick, man.
###618 Skating is sick.
###620 He's the best in the world.
###623 Yeah.
###623 I would never leave my area, plus well, back then I felt as
###626 though everything was right at your front door.
###629 You don't have to go far for curves.
###633 People we're traveling around the world for curves?
###636 This is Alta Vista.
###637 The curve is still waxed.
###639 See, I got to get out and try to hard flip
###641 it and 5-0 it again.
###642 Should we stop and get out?
###644 -Yeah.
###644 Let's get out.
###645 -Tim Gammond had a fakie tre, fake nose grind going on here.
###648 Insane.
###649 
###652 Actually, we should be coming here on those days where we
###654 have nowhere to go.
###655 This one was in "New World Order." So there was like a
###658 hard flip [INAUDIBLE]
###659 180 and there was a--
###660 Everything was filmed from pretty much that angle to
###662 where you're at.
###663 Thing is huge still.
###665 You got a marker because I want to write
###666 down what's been done.
###669 Don't you hate hate that?
###670 I've been to so many spots where people write down what
###672 they've done.
###673 It's me like when there is steep walls are something like
###677 tail block, back side tail block.
###679 What did Richard have on it?
###681 I know I can't remember anything Richard had, man.
###684 Richard had so much stuff it's hard to remember.
###686 Didn't you lose your virginity here, Daniel?
###688 I'm just playing.
###690 -Yeah, right.
###691 You lost your virginity at Kareem's.
###694 Yeah, I did the world parks.
###695 The craziest stuff would happen at that place.
###698 So many random chicks would show up and--
###700 -There was quarter pipes.
###701 -There was quarter pipes they had the beast wall like there
###704 was actually a bunch of stuff like this big
###705 six foot mini ramp.
###707 
###710 In '92 and '93, that's where I think the most innovative
###714 skating went down within like Gino and Mike Keenan and
###717 everybody and you just see the craziest stuff going down.
###720 You actually watched somebody do something new.
###723 You know what I mean?
###724 That was crazy.
###725 I'm sure we've stayed in every one of these little motels.
###727 Rocko used to put us in like, yep.
###730 You guys are staying here.
###731 He would just put us in random places or just give us money,
###734 like one dude money the oldest one, which was probably like
###737 15, the responsibility to get us a room.
###741 And then once the World part came along, that's when it
###743 ended up being in like a little place to stay.
###747 Remember the Imperial double set?
###749 Dude, Daniel calling it out.
###752 Jeremy Wray all he did flawless.
###754 He was Jeremy Wray though.
###755 He could probably backside flip it now.
###757 I only did it with Sock filming but, it was like when
###760 you ollie, and you lean back and one leg
###763 goes up, and I fell.
###764 And I remember telling Sock you can't cut it.
###768 It's so funny asking somebody that question,
###769 like can you cut it?
###771 Hey, is this how Wallenburg looks, like one more?
###774 -Vista, you ever been there?
###776 -No.
###777 Yeah.
###777 He's kept himself in like the whole South Bay area his
###780 entire life as far as skateboarding goes.
###785 I look back at like think of all the video footage and
###788 stuff from just the years past.
###791 It's all there.
###792 I don't think I've really noticed it too.
###795 Do it where you want to.
###796 That's what I say.
###798 -There's a place like after I kick jumped it in "Love
###800 Child," we came back and I tried to front side flip it.
###803 And then the board, I don't know if Sock still has the
###806 footage, but I stepped on the nose and it completely smacked
###809 me in my face.
###810 Jeremy Wray really killed that thing, fakie hill, front side
###814 flip, narly back side flip, everything.
###817 See?
###819 It's pretty long because he took three
###820 steps on the flat part.
###822 Pretty tall guy too.
###824 This thing's huge.
###826 Guy switch tre-ed one day and some do but he
###829 forgot to film it.
###833 Guy was probably like ah, oh, well.
###837 -I think I did it once without filming.
###840 I went back to film it and I think maybe it took a lot of
###844 tries and the cameraman ran out of batteries, so the
###846 footage got messed up or something.
###849 And it is very important to document this stuff, but it's
###854 not what it's all about.
###856 -It's nut.
###857 I ain't going out to launch at the top of this baby.
###860 And they even made a baby ramp too. they made like a 3 and
###864 1/2 foot kicker.
###865 When they go, they go big.
###869 To switch tre though that's nuts.
###872 And at that time too.
###874 -What year was that?
###876 -That was like '93, right?
###879 '93.
###880 Well, it was underground at the same time too.
###882 And you had to wait a year and a half to
###884 ever see any new skating.
###886 We didn't have YouTube.
###887 We didn't have--
###888 
###891 you couldn't just go to somebody's site and watch all
###893 this new footage that came out within the last week.
###897 So we're headed to the imperial blocks.
###899 These were the hub for us in '92 and '93.
###904 Now, we used to skate these ones.
###905 Oh, wait.
###906 Was it those ones?
###907 
###911 Pretty nuts.
###912 Coming back to spots like this and thinking about all the
###916 stuff you couldn't do and still can't do, probably.
###920 I tried a lot of shit I couldn't do but there was a
###922 couple of guys that came here and was I think Rick was
###925 trying to do a front to half calf grip crooked grind, maybe
###928 or some back in those days, which was nuts
###930 to even think about.
###932 And then in the plan B day we had front to calf
###935 flipped the hard way.
###936 So like a back 50 or 5-0.
###939 I think Henry Hambertino did backs 180 hill fakie nose
###941 grind on that one.
###943 Switching on hill, switch 5-0, that's pretty nuts too.
###946 It's so funny how so much stuff went down like that back
###949 then, but you've seen so much crazy stuff like that back
###952 then that nothing really, everything just went by.
###955 It wasn't like you had one good thing in your part.
###958 You watched people's parts and everything was good.
###960 So you're just like, yeah, that was good, that was good,
###962 that was good, that was good.
###962 His part's over.
###963 OK.
###965 Like '94 to '95, I just was over it.
###969 Hung out at Long Beach all the time.
###971 Shiloh had told me later, like Rodney an them were
###973 hitting them up.
###974 Like Daewon's not skating anymore.
###975 He's doing something else and Rodney was telling Shiloh
###978 like, hey, we might have to kick him off.
###979 And Shiloh was telling them, you can't
###981 kick Daewon off, man.
###983 He'll skate.
###983 He's going to skate.
###984 And I came back and called Rodney.
###986 I was like look, I'm sorry for not being around, but I'm back
###989 and I'm going to try to work on trying to
###991 get something going.
###991 You know what I mean?
###993 -I always knew that that guy can't he probably could never
###996 quit skating.
###999 He loves to do it so much.
###1001 And that's when we started filming and I did the whole
###1004 "Trilogy" part.
###1005 It put me back on the map.
###1006 You know what I mean?
###1008 There was nothing left to really skate.
###1010 Everything got skate stopped.
###1011 Everything got blocked, all the curbs just were curbs.
###1014 Ended up going to some school putting tables downstairs and
###1018 we never got hassled.
###1019 So I was like look, I guess this is where it's all going
###1021 to happen now.
###1022 It was almost like a new type of skating for me.
###1025 Like now I'm going to focus on this.
###1028 -Yeah.
###1028 I remember later then seeing footage of Daewon.
###1032 I thought they said he didn't skate anymore, and he was
###1035 fucking ripping.
###1037 I remember when he was doing all the picnic table shit.
###1040 But I mean I always thought he was gnarly, you know?
###1043 But there's only so many picnic tables you can see.
###1047 -I got a lot of shit for the picnic
###1048 table thing for a while.
###1050 There was no way of how people try to erase things out of
###1053 their life, and that will be there forever to haunt me,
###1055 which I'm not ashamed of it.
###1057 I used to love the whole picnic table thing, but it got
###1062 a little too overboard.
###1064 I went on tour and my nickname because in Australia was like
###1067 the picnic table wizard.
###1070 They would have picnic table specifically
###1072 there so when I came.
###1073 I remember one of the guys came up to me and was like,
###1075 Daewon man, I'm still glad you're here, man.
###1076 I'm sorry we couldn't get you the picnic tables.
###1080 I was like, well, God damn it, there's nothing
###1082 I can do here then.
###1083 I'm out.
###1084 But my whole problem is I get caught up and I over do it
###1086 like eating too much cake.
###1087 If you give me a whole cake, I'll eat the whole thing, and
###1089 it drives people nuts.
###1090 Like dude, please no more.
###1092 -He was real crazy into like the benches.
###1095 -Yeah, I hit those spots, but like the way this guy looks at
###1099 shit is so crazy.
###1101 Like he would be oh, you could skate.
###1103 I made this spot and you could skate like this and that.
###1105 And I'll look at the spot.
###1106 I'm like, how did you even get that from-- you know I don't
###1110 look at it like that.
###1111 He'll take it to the extreme, man.
###1113 I I think that's the way he does things.
###1116 He gets into something, and he just sticks with it till he
###1120 burns it out for himself.
###1122 -Honestly, he's on a different level than anybody.
###1125 There's only like a few guys out there that are like at the
###1129 same level like Costen and Reynolds and those kind of
###1132 guys, you know.
###1133 And then there's things like the middle like me.
###1139 Daewon is definitely on the top.
###1141 -"Round Three," he skated those top of those fucking big
###1145 rigs, right?
###1146 And he was telling me oh, I'm doing this big rig thing.
###1150 You should come down, dude, like just back heel it.
###1153 I'm like what?
###1154 Like hell, no.
###1156 That shit is like death defying.
###1159 -I've been just trying to have fun with it.
###1162 It's really easy to stay motivated as long as you just
###1164 kind of put yourself in a new place.
###1166 Like for me, the whole "Cheese and Crackers" thing, that was
###1167 just all fun, three months of just fun, and we ended up
###1170 getting a video out of it.
###1171 But that's how "Love Child" was.
###1173 -So you think something like "Cheese and Crackers" couldn't
###1176 have come out in like the mid '90s?
###1177 -No.
###1177 I don't think nobody would have cared and plus when they
###1179 said vert died, in those days it really did, even anything
###1183 to do with it, even if it was just mini ramper tranny,
###1186 people were dead serious.
###1187 Like nobody wanted to see it.
###1189 Costen, he did a 360 tail grab fakie nose
###1192 grind revert in a video.
###1195 People don't talk about that.
###1197 It's come back to that point now where I think tranny, it's
###1201 cool again.
###1202 -Is your trucks always like that, loose?
###1204 -M-hm.
###1205 
###1208 -Is that just how you skate 'em?
###1209 -M-hm.
###1209 -I always think like tech skating you have to have tight
###1212 trucks.
###1212 -That's what everybody thinks, but I couldn't do a nose
###1215 tranny unless my truck was that loose.
###1218 Plus these days, I don't know.
###1220 -I think Rodriguez has his trucks like that.
