3
0:0:7,87 --> 0:0:10,19
VITO ACCONCI: I remember being
tremendously jolted the first


4
0:0:10,19 --> 0:0:15,51
time I saw a Jasper
Johns painting.


5
0:0:15,51 --> 0:0:21,3
And it seemed like, wow,
conventions are important.


6
0:0:21,3 --> 0:0:23,93
It's as if Jasper Johns really
wanted to do all these little


7
0:0:23,93 --> 0:0:26,72
abstract brush strokes,
but he said, why


8
0:0:26,72 --> 0:0:28,5
would anybody pay attention?


9
0:0:28,5 --> 0:0:31,865
However, if I make a number
five, you can't help pay


10
0:0:31,865 --> 0:0:33,84
attention-- if you
make a target.


11
0:0:33,84 --> 0:0:37,36
It's a way to draw people in,
which made me think in terms


12
0:0:37,36 --> 0:0:39,87
of English.


13
0:0:39,87 --> 0:0:41,96
English language idioms--


14
0:0:41,96 --> 0:0:43,81
can you play with words?


15
0:0:43,81 --> 0:0:46,875
The great thing about words is
that they seem so definite,


16
0:0:46,875 --> 0:0:50,26
but they're so hazy
and cloudy.


17
0:0:50,26 --> 0:0:53,63
You can pick one word within
a word and it starts to


18
0:0:53,63 --> 0:0:56,7
contradict the basic word.


19
0:0:56,7 --> 0:0:59,36
I don't want to do something
that refers to


20
0:0:59,36 --> 0:1:0,986
something off the page.


21
0:1:0,986 --> 0:1:4,42
Towards the end of the time I
was writing, I started to


22
0:1:4,42 --> 0:1:10,84
think, I can't use words like
"tree," "chair." This refers


23
0:1:10,84 --> 0:1:13,87
to a space off the page, whereas
I could use, on the


24
0:1:13,87 --> 0:1:17,17
page, words like "there,"
"then," "at that time," "in


25
0:1:17,17 --> 0:1:19,11
that space," "in that place"--


26
0:1:19,11 --> 0:1:24,15
words that directly referred to
my act of writing the page,


27
0:1:24,15 --> 0:1:27,13
words that referred to
the reader's act of


28
0:1:27,13 --> 0:1:28,5
going down the page.


29
0:1:28,5 --> 0:1:32,4
They were almost like guides
for the reader.


30
0:1:32,4 --> 0:1:32,79
Though, eventually--


31
0:1:32,79 --> 0:1:39,55
one of the last poems I wrote
was a poem consisting of a


32
0:1:39,55 --> 0:1:41,56
page on reading speed--


33
0:1:41,56 --> 0:1:43,2
how to improve reading speed.


34
0:1:43,2 --> 0:1:47,31
The title given to it was
something like "The Time Taken


35
0:1:47,31 --> 0:1:51,73
For Me to Walk From 14th Street
and 6th Avenue to 14th


36
0:1:51,73 --> 0:1:53,25
Street and 5th Avenue"--


37
0:1:53,25 --> 0:1:55,69
so an attempt to make
reading time


38
0:1:55,69 --> 0:1:57,35
equivalent to writing time.


39
0:1:57,35 --> 0:2:1,44
By the time I got there, I
thought, I can't turn back.


40
0:2:1,44 --> 0:2:3,94
The stuff has taken me
out to the street.


41
0:2:3,94 --> 0:2:6,7
And also, I started to question,
if I'm so interested


42
0:2:6,7 --> 0:2:10,949
in space and moving over a
space, why am I moving over an


43
0:2:10,949 --> 0:2:12,75

of paper?


44
0:2:12,75 --> 0:2:14,3
There's a floor out there.


45
0:2:14,3 --> 0:2:15,66
There's a street out there.


46
0:2:15,66 --> 0:2:17,82
There's a world out there.


47
0:2:17,82 --> 0:2:19,23
What can I do on the street?


48
0:2:19,23 --> 0:2:20,4
Follow a person.


49
0:2:20,4 --> 0:2:22,63
What I thought of
as activities--


50
0:2:22,63 --> 0:2:24,37
they weren't exactly
performances.


51
0:2:24,37 --> 0:2:25,73
There wasn't a viewer.


52
0:2:25,73 --> 0:2:28,39
If anything, I was the viewer.


53
0:2:28,39 --> 0:2:30,19
I used what was available.


54
0:2:30,19 --> 0:2:32,92
I started to use a
Super 8 camera--


55
0:2:32,92 --> 0:2:34,8
later, a video camera.


56
0:2:34,8 --> 0:2:38,68
I was very struck by a beautiful
Charlie Chaplin


57
0:2:38,68 --> 0:2:43,68
statement when he was asked, why
didn't he ever use a close


58
0:2:43,68 --> 0:2:45,27
up in his comedies?


59
0:2:45,27 --> 0:2:48,3
And his answer was, well,
there's just nothing funny


60
0:2:48,3 --> 0:2:53,67
about a face 15 feet high,
which changed my life.


61
0:2:53,67 --> 0:2:57,585
And then I realized, but
video is a place--


62
0:2:57,585 --> 0:3:0,89
a video monitor, a video screen,
at least then, was


63
0:3:0,89 --> 0:3:3,53
approximately the size
of a person's face.


64
0:3:3,53 --> 0:3:7,39
So the way I did videos was
my face on screen, face


65
0:3:7,39 --> 0:3:8,6
to face with you--


66
0:3:8,6 --> 0:3:10,99
I have to assume somebody's
going to watch it--


67
0:3:10,99 --> 0:3:12,36
with you offscreen.


68
0:3:12,36 --> 0:3:14,34
What am I doing in
relation to you?


69
0:3:14,34 --> 0:3:15,44
First of all, where am I?


70
0:3:15,44 --> 0:3:17,79
Am I face to face with you?


71
0:3:17,79 --> 0:3:19,88
And in this case, I'm
on the floor.


72
0:3:19,88 --> 0:3:21,47
I'm either a pet
cat or a snake.

74
0:3:24,398 --> 0:3:27,44
No, I don't need your picture.


75
0:3:27,44 --> 0:3:30,84
I don't have to know
what you look like.

hello yet.

You can look like anybody.


78
0:3:34,59 --> 0:3:36,458
I'll take anybody.


79
0:3:36,458 --> 0:3:41,128
I'll take anything I can get.


80
0:3:41,128 --> 0:3:43,25
Some of the videos I
did before this--


81
0:3:43,25 --> 0:3:45,3
I was really struck by the--


82
0:3:45,3 --> 0:3:49,3
sorry, I can't say I stole
this from these movies.


83
0:3:49,3 --> 0:3:55,35
But it was '72, '73, a great
Bob Rafelson movie called


84
0:3:55,35 --> 0:3:57,8
"King of Marvin Gardens."


85
0:3:57,8 --> 0:4:0,66
It begins with black and Jack
Nicholson's face leaning into


86
0:4:0,66 --> 0:4:4,27
the screen, and direct
confrontation.


87
0:4:4,27 --> 0:4:5,27
That was important to me.


88
0:4:5,27 --> 0:4:8,9
Though, I had done stuff
before that, I guess.


89
0:4:8,9 --> 0:4:12,76
But actually, I think a lot of
the face-to-face video stuff I


90
0:4:12,76 --> 0:4:15,43
did was really not until '73.


91
0:4:15,43 --> 0:4:21,209
So I think I got it from "King
of Marvin Gardens."

-People always say about you
that, at some point, you


93

VITO ACCONCI: To me, the
shorthand to the time is the


95
0:4:29,32 --> 0:4:31,0
music of the time.


96
0:4:31,0 --> 0:4:36,7
In the late '60s, early '70s, I
was listening to Neil Young,


97
0:4:36,7 --> 0:4:38,17
Van Morrison--


98
0:4:38,17 --> 0:4:41,34
single voice, long song.


99
0:4:41,34 --> 0:4:43,36
There was something else
going on in the music.


100
0:4:43,36 --> 0:4:46,25
The introduction of the Velvet
Underground was like the


101
0:4:46,25 --> 0:4:50,32
introduction of the city in the
middle of what, in effect,


102
0:4:50,32 --> 0:4:52,94
was rural music,
country music.


103
0:4:52,94 --> 0:4:54,94
You have all the time in
the world to wander.


104
0:4:54,94 --> 0:4:58,165
But Velvet Underground was the
city's closing in on you.


105
0:4:58,165 --> 0:5:0,73
So by the mid '70s, I
was listening to a


106
0:5:0,73 --> 0:5:1,63
different kind of music.


107
0:5:1,63 --> 0:5:4,805

for six minutes.

It started to become clear
to me that my stuff is so


112
0:5:21,67 --> 0:5:23,186
grounded on the '60s.


113
0:5:23,186 --> 0:5:29,78
It's so grounded on a time in
which the common language is


114
0:5:29,78 --> 0:5:34,64
finding oneself, as if the self
is something that you


115
0:5:34,64 --> 0:5:38,902
separate from the rest of the
person and concentrate on and

loved museums.

I don't know, it's

123
0:5:52,45 --> 0:5:58,906
I think I don't feel a
connection to the art world.


124
0:5:58,906 --> 0:6:0,4
But I always had questions
about the art


125
0:6:0,4 --> 0:6:3,35
world, even when I started.


126
0:6:3,35 --> 0:6:7,63
I come from a generation who had
the illusion that we were


127
0:6:7,63 --> 0:6:11,67
going to do the kind of work
that would make galleries go


128
0:6:11,67 --> 0:6:12,29
out of existence.


129
0:6:12,29 --> 0:6:13,32
We were very naive.


130
0:6:13,32 --> 0:6:15,49
And also, in some ways, a
lot of us were right.


131
0:6:15,49 --> 0:6:17,55
We didn't make commodities,
so we always had a


132
0:6:17,55 --> 0:6:18,78
difficult time surviving.


133
0:6:18,78 --> 0:6:23,21
By '73, '74, '75, I and a lot of
other people were starting


134
0:6:23,21 --> 0:6:25,3
to have very different
notions of self.


135
0:6:25,3 --> 0:6:30,94
Self wasn't this precious
jewel that you found and


136
0:6:30,94 --> 0:6:32,39
focused on.


137
0:6:32,39 --> 0:6:37,22
Self maybe existed only as part
of a social system, a


138
0:6:37,22 --> 0:6:40,3
cultural system, a
political system.


139
0:6:40,3 --> 0:6:43,47
By the mid '70s, I wanted stuff
of mine to be part of


140
0:6:43,47 --> 0:6:44,5
those overall systems.


141
0:6:44,5 --> 0:6:47,59
In other words, I thought,
is my stuff inherently


142
0:6:47,59 --> 0:6:49,79
self-enclosed?


143
0:6:49,79 --> 0:6:52,8
Yes, it was me and you.


144
0:6:52,8 --> 0:6:54,47
But what about we?


145
0:6:54,47 --> 0:6:59,1
Once I did "Seedbed" in '72, I
started to realize it's not


146
0:6:59,1 --> 0:7:0,47
the '60s anymore.


147
0:7:0,47 --> 0:7:3,93
I might have masturbated
in a gallery in 1972.


148
0:7:3,93 --> 0:7:7,79
People were fucking in
the streets in 1965.


149
0:7:7,79 --> 0:7:9,4
Art is a little slow.

Luckily, life is faster.

Our first goal is really
not to build.


154
0:7:22,4 --> 0:7:27,3
Our first goal is, can we come
up with a design, can we


155
0:7:27,3 --> 0:7:31,54
design a space, can we design
a condition that


156
0:7:31,54 --> 0:7:32,77
will surprise us?


157
0:7:32,77 --> 0:7:35,74
An attempt we made a few years
ago to propose a new light


158
0:7:35,74 --> 0:7:37,18
system for New York--


159
0:7:37,18 --> 0:7:40,97
the competition brief said
that the new light system


160
0:7:40,97 --> 0:7:44,5
should have a very thick post,
because the post would have to


161
0:7:44,5 --> 0:7:46,52
hold different kinds of lights,


162
0:7:46,52 --> 0:7:48,19
different kinds of signs.


163
0:7:48,19 --> 0:7:50,76
We thought this was probably
misguided since you wouldn't


164
0:7:50,76 --> 0:7:53,49
need all those different kinds
of lights, all those different


165
0:7:53,49 --> 0:7:55,79
kinds of signs, all the time.


166
0:7:55,79 --> 0:7:57,6
Let's take the opposite
approach.


167
0:7:57,6 --> 0:8:1,7
Let's use the thinnest
pole possible.


168
0:8:1,7 --> 0:8:3,56
Then, each pole would
hold one kind of


169
0:8:3,56 --> 0:8:5,61
light, one kind of sign.


170
0:8:5,61 --> 0:8:9,24
The more you needed then, you
would braid them together.


171
0:8:9,24 --> 0:8:15,26
You would braid each one sign,
one light post together so you


172
0:8:15,26 --> 0:8:17,24
could have multiple
lights at posts.


173
0:8:17,24 --> 0:8:20,5
Needless to say, the new light
system is exactly the same as


174
0:8:20,5 --> 0:8:21,12
the old one.


175
0:8:21,12 --> 0:8:26,38
We, like a lot of people, made
a kind of attempt at a


176
0:8:26,38 --> 0:8:30,1
possible new World
Trade Center.


177
0:8:30,1 --> 0:8:33,62
We proposed a World Trade
Center full of holes.


178
0:8:33,62 --> 0:8:36,669
Our starting point was that if
a building nowadays is going


179
0:8:36,669 --> 0:8:39,789
to be exploded anyway, maybe a
building nowadays should come


180
0:8:39,789 --> 0:8:40,51
already exploded.


181
0:8:40,51 --> 0:8:43,9
It should come pre-exploded.


182
0:8:43,9 --> 0:8:46,21
So we take the original site
of the World Trade Center,


183
0:8:46,21 --> 0:8:49,13
extrude it to a height
of 110 stories high--


184
0:8:49,13 --> 0:8:52,44
more of a mass, more of a volume
than the original World


185
0:8:52,44 --> 0:8:55,73
Trade Center ever was, more
private office space than


186
0:8:55,73 --> 0:8:59,56
anybody could possibly need so
we could shoot cones into it.


187
0:8:59,56 --> 0:9:2,33
Now that the building is riddled
with holes, it can


188
0:9:2,33 --> 0:9:5,57
possibly act as a kind
of urban camouflage.


189
0:9:5,57 --> 0:9:9,75
A terrorist flying by above
looks down and says, we don't


190
0:9:9,75 --> 0:9:10,54
have to bother about
this building.


191
0:9:10,54 --> 0:9:12,53
It's already been dealt with.


192
0:9:12,53 --> 0:9:16,66
Now that the building is riddled
with holes, there are


193
0:9:16,66 --> 0:9:19,9
now tunnels from one side
to another, tunnels


194
0:9:19,9 --> 0:9:20,44
from bottom to top.


195
0:9:20,44 --> 0:9:23,4
Now that there are tunnels
through the building, the rest


196
0:9:23,4 --> 0:9:24,71
of the building can
come inside.


197
0:9:24,71 --> 0:9:27,2
Parks can come inside
the building.


198
0:9:27,2 --> 0:9:29,49
Street vendors can come
inside the building.


199
0:9:29,49 --> 0:9:31,75
In other words, instead of
trying to observe the


200
0:9:31,75 --> 0:9:35,11
convention of private office
building with so-called public


201
0:9:35,11 --> 0:9:38,69
space outside, can we mix
public and private?


202
0:9:38,69 --> 0:9:41,28
Which, I think, our projects,
at least when they work,


203
0:9:41,28 --> 0:9:43,0
always try to do.


204
0:9:43,0 --> 0:9:47,89
This is paradoxical maybe, but
even though we build far from


205
0:9:47,89 --> 0:9:50,7
everything we do, we do think
it's necessary to build,


206
0:9:50,7 --> 0:9:55,1
because you have to build in
order to test the theory.


207
0:9:55,1 --> 0:9:57,8
And the only way you can test
the theory is what happens


208
0:9:57,8 --> 0:9:59,5
when other people come in.


209
0:9:59,5 --> 0:10:8,47



210
0:10:8,47 --> 0:10:11,65
I got a lot of my ideas of
architecture from "Blade


211
0:10:11,65 --> 0:10:15,62
Runner." "Blade Runner" was
so startling to me.


212
0:10:15,62 --> 0:10:19,89
This contradicted the 2001
notion of architecture.


213
0:10:19,89 --> 0:10:22,34
The future is abstract
and all white.


214
0:10:22,34 --> 0:10:24,92
The "Blade Runner" notion
shrugged its shoulders and


215
0:10:24,92 --> 0:10:27,2
said, we're never going to have
enough money to build


216
0:10:27,2 --> 0:10:28,6
from the beginning.


217
0:10:28,6 --> 0:10:31,775
Let's just tack on to what's
already there.


218
0:10:31,775 --> 0:10:35,17
And again, it made
a kind of sense.


219
0:10:35,17 --> 0:10:40,6
So our first goal is to do
something that surprises us.


220
0:10:40,6 --> 0:10:45,46
And hopefully, if it surprises
us, maybe it can surprise and


221
0:10:45,46 --> 0:10:50,48
excite at least one
other person.


222
0:10:50,48 --> 0:10:52,32
Graz, for example--


223
0:10:52,32 --> 0:10:56,42
we always made the assumption
that probably there's a chance


224
0:10:56,42 --> 0:10:59,16
that younger people
like our work.


225
0:10:59,16 --> 0:11:1,84
I don't think we have much of
a chance with older people.


226
0:11:1,84 --> 0:11:4,54
But that's OK.


227
0:11:4,54 --> 0:11:8,17
It's a way that I can
maybe pretend that


228
0:11:8,17 --> 0:11:9,715
I'm not getting older.


229
0:11:9,715 --> 0:11:12,69
When the Graz island was
finished, people in Graz


230
0:11:12,69 --> 0:11:16,82
started to use the island
as a place for walks.


231
0:11:16,82 --> 0:11:19,26
And a lot of old people were
walking on the island.


232
0:11:19,26 --> 0:11:22,38
I was really surprised.


233
0:11:22,38 --> 0:11:26,33
The interesting thing, when
somebody was in the theater--


234
0:11:26,33 --> 0:11:28,3
and especially, I remember,
this happened a


235
0:11:28,3 --> 0:11:29,87
lot with older people.


236
0:11:29,87 --> 0:11:31,1
They're in the theater.


237
0:11:31,1 --> 0:11:32,4
They're walking.


238
0:11:32,4 --> 0:11:34,84
Suddenly, they look
up and around, and


239
0:11:34,84 --> 0:11:37,9
they started to laugh.


240
0:11:37,9 --> 0:11:40,8
It seemed like, well, maybe
they kind of got


241
0:11:40,8 --> 0:11:41,93
the feeling of it.


242
0:11:41,93 --> 0:11:44,49
They were in this open space.


243
0:11:44,49 --> 0:11:47,75
Now, without realizing it,
without going through an


244
0:11:47,75 --> 0:11:51,28
entrance, it became a
more closed space.


245
0:11:51,28 --> 0:11:55,3
And even though we couldn't use
the same language, people


246
0:11:55,3 --> 0:11:57,5
came up to us and thanked us.


247
0:11:57,5 --> 0:11:59,605
There was a peace tree
named after us.


248
0:11:59,605 --> 0:12:3,93
Now, I don't know if I can say
that's totally a sign, but it


249
0:12:3,93 --> 0:12:6,77
seemed like--


250
0:12:6,77 --> 0:12:9,96
What we were asked to do was
this person-made island that


251
0:12:9,96 --> 0:12:13,38
would have three functions--
a theater, a cafe, and a


252
0:12:13,38 --> 0:12:14,44
playground.


253
0:12:14,44 --> 0:12:15,88
So we started with the


254
0:12:15,88 --> 0:12:17,44
conventional idea of a theater--


255
0:12:17,44 --> 0:12:18,5
a bowl.


256
0:12:18,5 --> 0:12:20,25
What if we twist the bowl?


257
0:12:20,25 --> 0:12:21,85
What if we turn it
upside down?


258
0:12:21,85 --> 0:12:23,29
Bowl becomes dome.


259
0:12:23,29 --> 0:12:25,1
Dome becomes the cafe.


260
0:12:25,1 --> 0:12:29,58
The twisting, warping space
in between becomes the


261
0:12:29,58 --> 0:12:30,42
playground.


262
0:12:30,42 --> 0:12:35,18
You walk in under a canopy
that twists down to make


263
0:12:35,18 --> 0:12:38,34
lounge seating around
the cafe.


264
0:12:38,34 --> 0:12:42,89
Our bar twists down to make
a number of bar counters.


265
0:12:42,89 --> 0:12:45,9
The reason for the number of bar
counters is that when we


266
0:12:45,9 --> 0:12:49,91
design a project, we try to
envision what can happen here.


267
0:12:49,91 --> 0:12:50,97
This is a bar.


268
0:12:50,97 --> 0:12:52,19
Somebody's drunk.


269
0:12:52,19 --> 0:12:54,98
Whenever this person extends
his or her hand, they might


270
0:12:54,98 --> 0:12:57,87
hit a bar counter, at least
they have some chance.


271
0:12:57,87 --> 0:13:1,38
I always say, yes, we give
people a place to use.


272
0:13:1,38 --> 0:13:4,395
If we put a couple of folding
chairs there, would it have


273
0:13:4,395 --> 0:13:6,51
done the same thing?


274
0:13:6,51 --> 0:13:8,87
I hope we provide more
than a folding chair.


275
0:13:8,87 --> 0:13:11,13
We provide a folding
chair with a twist.


276
0:13:11,13 --> 0:13:12,66
Does everybody want that?


277
0:13:12,66 --> 0:13:14,48
I hope--


278
0:13:14,48 --> 0:13:16,2
maybe everybody doesn't
want it.


279
0:13:16,2 --> 0:13:18,75
Do we want something that
everybody wants?


280
0:13:18,75 --> 0:13:22,93
I guess we want to appeal to
people who think that, wow, I


281
0:13:22,93 --> 0:13:27,4
didn't know space didn't have
to be implacable and fixed.


282
0:13:27,4 --> 0:13:30,39
Now that I've been in this
space, maybe I can turn my


283
0:13:30,39 --> 0:13:31,61
space upside down.


284
0:13:31,61 --> 0:13:33,93
Maybe I can twist my space.


285
0:13:33,93 --> 0:13:37,52
I admit, do we want to
appeal to everybody?


286
0:13:37,52 --> 0:13:37,85
No.


287
0:13:37,85 --> 0:13:41,36
We want to appeal to people
who want a second


288
0:13:41,36 --> 0:13:44,85
chance, want a future.


289
0:13:44,85 --> 0:13:48,77



290
0:13:48,77 --> 0:13:54,65
I got so excited with the notion
of a computer-oriented


291
0:13:54,65 --> 0:13:59,24
time, because it seems like
everybody has things


292
0:13:59,24 --> 0:14:1,17
in their own hands.


293
0:14:1,17 --> 0:14:6,845
So it seems this should be the
most optimistic time ever.


294
0:14:6,845 --> 0:14:12,74
Ideally, we want to do stuff
that couldn't have been built,


295
0:14:12,74 --> 0:14:14,92
couldn't have been designed,
ideally, couldn't even have


296
0:14:14,92 --> 0:14:17,25
been dreamt of before
the 21st century.


297
0:14:17,25 --> 0:14:18,645
We don't do that.


298
0:14:18,645 --> 0:14:20,82
But we wish could.


299
0:14:20,82 --> 0:14:21,68
We try.


300
0:14:21,68 --> 0:14:23,63
We wanted to make a system
that possibly


301
0:14:23,63 --> 0:14:26,95
could adapt to people.


302
0:14:26,95 --> 0:14:29,83
Could people change the
system they're in?


303
0:14:29,83 --> 0:14:32,56
This is a project we're
doing in Indianapolis.


304
0:14:32,56 --> 0:14:35,28
The street goes through
a building.


305
0:14:35,28 --> 0:14:39,5
When people go through it,
there's a structure of LED


306
0:14:39,5 --> 0:14:44,87
lights that follow you
and swarm around you.


307
0:14:44,87 --> 0:14:47,21
They're not exactly swarming
around you.


308
0:14:47,21 --> 0:14:49,26
It's an on and off system.


309
0:14:49,26 --> 0:14:51,31
But we wanted to make this
system that would be almost


310
0:14:51,31 --> 0:14:53,14
like fire flies.


311
0:14:53,14 --> 0:14:55,825
So fire flies would
follow you.


312
0:14:55,825 --> 0:14:57,71
If another one person
comes, the fire


313
0:14:57,71 --> 0:15:1,6
flies start to mingle.


314
0:15:1,6 --> 0:15:1,82
Can it be done?


315
0:15:1,82 --> 0:15:3,94
Yes.


316
0:15:3,94 --> 0:15:6,3
Can it be done for a
$600,000 budget?


317
0:15:6,3 --> 0:15:8,79
We're not sure yet, but
we think it can.


318
0:15:8,79 --> 0:15:12,29
But we've been working on
a number of projects


319
0:15:12,29 --> 0:15:15,1
that adjust to people.


320
0:15:15,1 --> 0:15:18,41
This is a proposal that won
this competition for a


321
0:15:18,41 --> 0:15:21,25
sculpture park in Bernau
in the Czech Republic.


322
0:15:21,25 --> 0:15:24,45
But whether it'll actually
happen is another matter.


323
0:15:24,45 --> 0:15:31,3
We wanted to fill the space with
these almost fake grass,


324
0:15:31,3 --> 0:15:32,4
fake bamboo.


325
0:15:32,4 --> 0:15:34,6
It would be fibers.


326
0:15:34,6 --> 0:15:37,46
As soon as a person walks, when
a person comes close, the


327
0:15:37,46 --> 0:15:39,76
fibers start to part.


328
0:15:39,76 --> 0:15:42,57
The fibers part to
let you through.


329
0:15:42,57 --> 0:15:46,99
This notion of things parting,
adjusting to people, is


330
0:15:46,99 --> 0:15:49,13
something we've tried a
number of versions.


331
0:15:49,13 --> 0:15:52,56
We did a tattoo based on
this system that--


332
0:15:52,56 --> 0:15:55,95
actually, one or two actual
tattoos exist.


333
0:15:55,95 --> 0:15:58,67
A person would pick out
the imperfections


334
0:15:58,67 --> 0:16:0,12
on his or her body.


335
0:16:0,12 --> 0:16:4,27
And then we would make a kind
of magnetic field system.


336
0:16:4,27 --> 0:16:8,23
One mole calls to the other.


337
0:16:8,23 --> 0:16:11,18
And we're wondering if we
can make a clothing


338
0:16:11,18 --> 0:16:12,42
system out of this.


339
0:16:12,42 --> 0:16:14,45
You pick five points
on the body--


340
0:16:14,45 --> 0:16:17,2
two nipples, a belly button,
and a vagina.


341
0:16:17,2 --> 0:16:20,1
Can one draw the other
and you make this


342
0:16:20,1 --> 0:16:21,81
kind of field system?


343
0:16:21,81 --> 0:16:28,33
Ideally, you can build a city on
this magnetic field system.


344
0:16:28,33 --> 0:16:30,65
But I don't know how
far we've gotten.


345
0:16:30,65 --> 0:16:33,4
There are a number of
architects, certainly not just


346
0:16:33,4 --> 0:16:37,98
us, who are trying to do things
according to principles


347
0:16:37,98 --> 0:16:39,39
of biology.


348
0:16:39,39 --> 0:16:43,67
Right now, it seems to
be only a metaphor.


349
0:16:43,67 --> 0:16:47,1
Yes, I can say, here's a
magnetic field system.


350
0:16:47,1 --> 0:16:51,45
Yeah, maybe you can use that
as a system of design, but


351
0:16:51,45 --> 0:16:54,12
it's not going to move
in the future.


352
0:16:54,12 --> 0:16:55,39
Maybe it will.


353
0:16:55,39 --> 0:16:58,4
But certainly not
as we've done.


354
0:16:58,4 --> 0:17:2,49
It's more of a design method,
where it should be a real


355
0:17:2,49 --> 0:17:4,67
growth method.


356
0:17:4,67 --> 0:17:7,45
We haven't figured out
how to do it yet.


357
0:17:7,45 --> 0:17:9,79
But at the same time, I don't
want to say that this isn't


358
0:17:9,79 --> 0:17:12,599
possible in the future.


359
0:17:12,599 --> 0:17:14,22
It's certainly not
possible now.


360
0:17:14,22 --> 0:17:17,75
Or maybe I even have to say more
validly that we haven't


361
0:17:17,75 --> 0:17:22,73
found a way to make what
we really want happen.


362
0:17:22,73 --> 0:17:25,4
But I can't say that, amongst
some of those architects that


363
0:17:25,4 --> 0:17:27,599
we admire, somebody might
have discovered it.


364
0:17:27,599 --> 0:17:29,2
We don't know about it yet.


365
0:17:29,2 --> 0:17:37,38



366
0:17:37,38 --> 0:17:40,2
Right now, we listen to
electronic music, Japanese


367
0:17:40,2 --> 0:17:42,36
noise music--


368
0:17:42,36 --> 0:17:43,25
no voice.


369
0:17:43,25 --> 0:17:44,75
We want music to be as--


370
0:17:44,75 --> 0:17:47,906
I think music and architecture
are exactly the same.


371
0:17:47,906 --> 0:17:52,0
Not exactly the same, but
they're at least analagous.


372
0:17:52,0 --> 0:17:56,17
Both music and architecture
make a surrounding.


373
0:17:56,17 --> 0:17:57,45
They make an ambiance.


374
0:17:57,45 --> 0:18:1,77
But also, both music and
architecture allow you to do


375
0:18:1,77 --> 0:18:4,83
something else-- something else
while listening to music,


376
0:18:4,83 --> 0:18:7,53
something else while in the
middle of architecture.


377
0:18:7,53 --> 0:18:11,18
To me, that's probably the
keynote of the 21st century.


378
0:18:11,18 --> 0:18:13,51
Like, I think, a lot of
architects now, I think what


379
0:18:13,51 --> 0:18:16,83
we really want is, can we make
a place you take with you?


380
0:18:16,83 --> 0:18:20,29
A little fashion magazine called
"The Black Book" a few


381
0:18:20,29 --> 0:18:24,23
years ago proposed to us that
the umbrella hasn't been


382
0:18:24,23 --> 0:18:25,99
redesigned in years.


383
0:18:25,99 --> 0:18:31,42
Could we try our hand at
an alternate umbrella?


384
0:18:31,42 --> 0:18:34,25
We started with the idea
of ruffles in clothing.


385
0:18:34,25 --> 0:18:38,29
So what we did was make a kind
of "umbruffla," combining


386
0:18:38,29 --> 0:18:40,62
umbrella and ruffles.


387
0:18:40,62 --> 0:18:44,36
It's made of two-way mirrored
mylar, so when you're wearing


388
0:18:44,36 --> 0:18:47,96
it, because of the change of
light, you can see out.


389
0:18:47,96 --> 0:18:50,8
But from outside, you just see
the reflections of city.


390
0:18:50,8 --> 0:18:52,99
So it acts as a camouflage
system.


391
0:18:52,99 --> 0:18:55,3
Our umbrella has some
advantages over the


392
0:18:55,3 --> 0:18:56,57
conventional umbrella.


393
0:18:56,57 --> 0:18:59,91
You can tie one end to your
waist, one end to your wrist


394
0:18:59,91 --> 0:19:2,3
so your hands are free.


395
0:19:2,3 --> 0:19:7,31
You can wrap it around you
like a kind of cloak.


396
0:19:7,31 --> 0:19:9,58
If another umbrella is coming
towards you, you don't have to


397
0:19:9,58 --> 0:19:10,67
bump umbrellas.


398
0:19:10,67 --> 0:19:12,51
You can wrap it around
yourself.


399
0:19:12,51 --> 0:19:14,98
It's an umbrella that two people
can use, so you can


400
0:19:14,98 --> 0:19:17,26
wrap another person
up with you.


401
0:19:17,26 --> 0:19:20,16
Then, the ruffles system, if
we do it well enough, will


402
0:19:20,16 --> 0:19:22,14
allow it to fold down.


403
0:19:22,14 --> 0:19:25,665
Ideally, it should fold into
the size of a wrist.


404
0:19:25,665 --> 0:19:29,5
I've always been told I'm a kind
of incurable optimist.


405
0:19:29,5 --> 0:19:32,66
I'm a curable optimist at the
same time, being an amazing


406
0:19:32,66 --> 0:19:34,1
depressive.


407
0:19:34,1 --> 0:19:37,1
Yes, computer has all these
kinds of possibilities.


408
0:19:37,1 --> 0:19:39,15
Religion and belief
is the opposite.


409
0:19:39,15 --> 0:19:41,88
I can't necessarily say that
religion and belief isn't


410
0:19:41,88 --> 0:19:43,57
going to win.


411
0:19:43,57 --> 0:19:48,54
I would be very optimistic if
I could be convinced that


412
0:19:48,54 --> 0:19:51,62
everybody wanted to leave home,
but I'm afraid a lot of


413
0:19:51,62 --> 0:19:54,24
people want to go back home.


414
0:19:54,24 --> 0:19:57,53
And going back home, I think, is
wanting something that you


415
0:19:57,53 --> 0:20:1,64
can be sure of, something that
you can believe, and also


416
0:20:1,64 --> 0:20:5,68
something that you can keep
other people out of.


417
0:20:5,68 --> 0:20:7,82
And that's scary.


418
0:20:7,82 --> 0:20:8,53
With--


419
0:20:8,53 --> 0:20:11,52
not just an instrument, but the
computer is a network of


420
0:20:11,52 --> 0:20:12,17
instruments.


421
0:20:12,17 --> 0:20:17,84
With a network of instruments
so vast, it seems like, can


422
0:20:17,84 --> 0:20:20,8
Homeland Security
ultimately win?


423
0:20:20,8 --> 0:20:21,97
I really don't think it can.


424
0:20:21,97 --> 0:20:23,87
I might not be around
to see it.


425
0:20:23,87 --> 0:20:27,6
What I want to believe, or
believe, is that-- and this


426
0:20:27,6 --> 0:20:30,94
has something to do with what I
was saying about the kind of


427
0:20:30,94 --> 0:20:34,24
stuff we really want to do
is the kind of place


428
0:20:34,24 --> 0:20:35,46
you carry with you.


429
0:20:35,46 --> 0:20:40,34
Maybe the future is a world
where people carry their own


430
0:20:40,34 --> 0:20:43,37
homes with them, where they
never have to go home.


431
0:20:43,37 --> 0:20:46,2
There are no boundaries
to cross.


432
0:20:46,2 --> 0:20:47,965
It's a world of nomads.


433
0:20:47,965 --> 0:20:52,83
A world of nomads can be an
incredibly exciting world, but


434
0:20:52,83 --> 0:20:54,8
it's the opposite of home.


435
0:20:54,8 --> 0:22:54,8
