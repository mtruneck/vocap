###5 SARAH HARRIS: The first thing that strikes you when you come
###8 to India is a sense of extreme contrasts.
###12 While some people are still shitting off the side of
###14 railway lines and eating from banana leaves, other people
###17 are drinking Frappuccinos and wearing Gucci sunglasses.
###21 Along with this feeling of progress and moving forward,
###24 there's still this undercurrent of tradition and
###28 religion and superstition and an even more deeply ingrained
###32 caste system.
###34 I didn't realize quite how sharp these contrasts between
###37 new and old India were until I came here last year to
###41 research an article about sex trafficking.
###44 And on my very first day here, I met a group of temple
###47 prostitutes who told me about this ancient Hindu system
###52 where prepubescent girls are dedicated to a goddess, and
###57 for the rest of their lives, they will become sex slaves of
###60 the temple.
###62 The name of that system is devadasi.
###64 
###75 This train's a little bit like The Darjeeling Limited, except
###79 we have cockroaches sleeping under our beds.
###85 And there's no one serving sweet lime.
###88 Hello.
###89 
###91 So in the beginning, being a devadasi had nothing to do
###94 with prostitution.
###96 In medieval India, they were glamorous temple dancers and
###99 held high social status.
###101 They performed sacred religious rituals and danced
###104 for loyalty in the name of a goddess called Yellamma.
###108 Over the centuries, the link between the devadasis and
###110 their temples gradually diminished, along with their
###113 social status.
###115 They became the paid mistresses of priests, then
###118 kings, and later, rich landowners.
###121 In the 19th century, Western missionaries tried to abolish
###125 the tradition, calling it grotesque and immoral, driving
###128 the devadasis underground.
###131 Today, devadasis are no different to common street
###135 hookers, servicing drunk truck drivers and bored businessmen.
###139 Even though the practice has been illegal for over 20
###142 years, up to 3,000 girls are still being secretly dedicated
###146 every year.
###147 We traveled to the border town of Sangli, which straddles the
###151 two southern Indian states of Karnataka and Maharastra.
###155 Its red light district is home to hundreds of devadasi sex
###159 workers, and that afternoon, we were invited there by
###162 Anitha, one of its most successful brothel owners.
###166 She's a member of an NGO called SANGRAM, which fights
###169 to empower locals sex workers.
###172 Communication was pretty painful, as our interpreter
###175 Somashekar was having some trouble with his English.
###178 Everybody in the houses next door--
###180 this whole street--
###181 is also sex workers like Anitha?
###186 Yes.
###187 
###189 SARAH HARRIS: So all the neighborhood.
###192 And they're all friends who live around here?
###194 Everybody is friends?
###195 
###200 SARAH HARRIS: So when the customer comes inside, the
###204 door closes.
###205 And this--
###206 
###219 SARAH HARRIS: She's not a customer?
###220 She is also a sex worker?
###222 SOMASHEKAR: A sex worker.
###223 SARAH HARRIS: And she uses this room?
###224 
###227 SOMASHEKAR: [SPEAKING MARATHI]
###229 [SARAH LAUGHING]
###231 SOMASHEKAR: That's another one of Anitha's friends who's
###233 lying in there.
###235 Hello.
###236 
###242 SARAH HARRIS: This is what she's saying?
###243 SOMASHEKAR: I am.
###243 SARAH HARRIS: You.
###245 
###252 SARAH HARRIS: Tell me again.
###252 So are you talking as you?
###254 Are you telling me--
###255 Somashekar.
###255 SOMASHEKAR: Huh?
###256 SARAH HARRIS: So you are a sex worker.
###258 SOMASHEKAR: I am a sex worker.
###258 SARAH HARRIS: You are a sex worker.
###259 And you came to Anitha's room, and--
###263 SARAH HARRIS: Yeah.
###266 SARAH HARRIS: You work in this room, and Anitha
###268 works in this room.
###269 SOMASHEKAR: This room.
###271 SARAH HARRIS: So you all work together.
###272 OK.
###274 [SPEAKING MARATHI]
###275 
###319 SARAH HARRIS: The whole place is completely difference to
###321 what I thought it would be.
###323 I kind of imagined these really seedy, anonymous
###327 hotel-looking brothels.
###330 And actually, there's kids running around everywhere.
###333 There's women doing their laundry, making lunch.
###337 And it kind of feels like quite a
###339 tight-knit little community.
###341 
###343 The ladies of Sangli wouldn't let me leave without showing
###346 me the temple around the corner.
###348 It seemed like wherever there were brothels, the goddess
###351 Yellamma was never far away.
###355 For Anitha and her friends, being a devadasi was nothing
###358 to be ashamed of.
###359 Sex work was their choice.
###361 They had condoms, power in numbers, and SANGRAM looking
###364 after them.
###365 But these were just the lucky few.
###369 For the vast majority of devadasis,
###371 prostitution isn't a choice.
###373 It's forced upon them, and most often by their parents.
###376 
###388 Like most Hindu legends, the story of the goddess Yellamma
###392 is long, convoluted, and surreal.
###394 
###399 However many times we heard it, it still
###401 didn't make much sense.
###403 But it seems to go something like this.
###406 The whole ordeal begins when her son is ordered to chop her
###409 head off by her husband after he catches her spying on two
###412 people getting frisky by a lake.
###416 After a complex process of death, reincarnation, and a
###419 load of fat Hindu gods with blue skin and gold bikinis,
###423 the goddess Yellamma was born.
###424 
###430 She fled to the villages of Karnataka and became a symbol
###432 of worship for the lowest Hindu castes.
###434 
###454 So after a really sweaty 10-hour train journey, we've
###457 finally arrived in this town called Mudhol
###459 up in Northern Karnataka.
###461 And it's in the villages around here that we've been
###463 told has the highest concentration of devadasi
###466 women in India.
###468 An estimated 23,000 women in this part of India have been
###473 dedicated to the goddess.
###475 And roughly half of those will have resorted to sex work in
###479 order to feed their families.
###480 
###487 SARAH HARRIS: We traveled to the outskirts of this dusty
###489 transit town to meet two teenage devadasi girls.
###494 [SPEAKING KANNADA]
###495 
###528 SARAH HARRIS: Madigas are considered filthy and
###530 polluting and are only permitted to work in the
###533 lowliest positions, as street cleaners, sewage collectors,
###537 and of course, prostitutes.
###538 
###540 When we took the girls out shopping, they seemed
###543 terrified of the higher castes recognizing them as devadasis,
###547 which they did.
###549 [SPEAKING KANNADA]
###551 
###562 SARAH HARRIS: It was surreal to see the reaction they got.
###565 The shopkeepers wouldn't even look them in the eye.
###568 [SPEAKING KANNADA]
###569 
###581 
###626 SARAH HARRIS: So now it seems this religious ritual is just
###629 a justification for poor families to
###631 pimp out their daughters.
###633 [SPEAKING KANNADA]
###634 
###664 SARAH HARRIS: It was strange sitting with Belavva's family
###667 on the floor of their one room hut, knowing it's also the
###670 place where she has sex with customers while her brothers
###673 and sisters wait outside.
###674 
###677 BALAVVA: [SPEAKING KANNADA]
###678 
###702 [SPEAKING KANNADA]
###703 
###723 SARAH HARRIS: Karnataka is one of India's largest producers
###726 of sugar cane.
###728 Hundreds of trucks pass through towns
###730 like this every day.
###733 The roadside can be a scary place.
###735 Horny drivers and bored agricultural workers gather
###738 here, looking for ways to spend their wages.
###742 They are one of the main transmitters of HIV throughout
###745 India, spreading the virus through the country's
###748 extensive road network, putting girls like Mala and
###752 Belavva at risk of this deadly disease.
###754 
###779 SARAH HARRIS: Back in Sangli, we were invited to meet
###781 another devadasi called Pandu.
###783 We were told she was different, but we weren't
###785 prepared for just how different.
###788 [MALE SPEAKING MARATHI]
###789 
###809 SARAH HARRIS: Every morning, he spent two hours polishing
###811 brass Yellamma statues and blessing his beloved shrine.
###815 [SPEAKING MARATHI]
###816 
###845 SARAH HARRIS: Can you ask him to show me how to make chai?
###850 Tea powder.
###852 
###856 Wow, that's a lot of sugar.
###857 Fucking hell.
###858 [SARAH LAUGHING]
###861 SARAH HARRIS: Still?
###861 Going, going, going, going, going.
###863 
###871 
###874 SARAH HARRIS: Can we watch him dance today?
###876 We have to persuade him, sweet talk him.
###878 
###881 Ah, wow.
###883 Wow, Pandu.
###885 Who's this guy?
###887 You put a sari over his head.
###889 [PANDU SPEAKING MARATHI]
###890 
###895 SARAH HARRIS: He's got money between his teeth.
###899 Your best friend, Sudir.
###900 
###903 Oh, wow, that's a nice photo.
###905 
###908 Wow, thank you.
###910 [SPEAKING MARATHI]
###912 
###1018 SARAH HARRIS: Later that day, at our hotel, Pandu showed us
###1021 his favorite Bollywood videos and the famous
###1024 Sangli condom trick.
###1025 
###1030 SARAH HARRIS: You're about to witness a demonstration of the
###1033 classic Sangli condom trick that Pandu has just taught me
###1037 when his male customers don't want to use a condom.
###1040 
###1043 [SPEAKING MARATHI]
###1044 
###1067 SARAH HARRIS: I think I lost.
###1070 Pandu may want a better life for his daughter, but for many
###1073 other devadasis, there's a lot of money to be made in
###1076 recruiting the next generation.
###1077 
###1081 Now, we're on our way to another village, about five
###1084 kilometers outside of Mudhol.
###1086 And most of women who live there are from the madiga
###1089 caste, and so most of them are
###1090 vulnerable to becoming devadasis.
###1093 One of the interesting things about this village is that
###1096 we're going to be able to go to the house of a devadasi
###1099 woman who's made a real career out of prostitution.
###1102 And she's built this enormous house in the middle of the
###1104 village as a kind of symbol of the her success.
###1107 So she can become a role model to the other girls living in
###1111 the village that becoming a devadasi is
###1113 a good way of life.
###1117 The legendary owner, Champa, doesn't even live here.
###1120 She's too busy turning tricks in Bombay.
###1123 Inside, shiny display cabinets of unused crockery line the
###1126 walls as testaments to her success.
###1129 There were groups of village children roaming around the
###1131 house to gawp at her flickering color TV sets and
###1135 shelves of broken electrical equipment.
###1138 The message is clear--
###1140 prostitution is a lucrative business.
###1141 
###1144 So this is the necklace, the muthu, that the devadasi women
###1150 wear when they get dedicated.
###1152 And hers is just hanging on the wall of her mud hut.
###1155 She's an old lady called Shavvavva, and she's one of
###1158 the oldest devadasi women in the village.
###1161 And I've just been told that she brought the very first
###1165 radio to this village.
###1167 No one had ever seen a radio before she brought it here.
###1172 Walking through the village, we notice Yellamma's presence
###1175 everywhere.
###1175 The locals told us that all devadasis in the area were
###1179 preparing themselves for the full moon festival, which is
###1182 apparently the most important event in
###1184 the Yellamma calendar.
###1185 
###1212 After hearing so much about the famous full moon festival
###1215 in Saundatti, we drove four hours out of town to catch the
###1219 first day of this month-long celebration of Yellamma.
###1223 Just up there in the center of that big arch is the face of
###1227 the goddess Yellamma.
###1231 That's the entrance to her temple here in Saundatti.
###1234 
###1238 Over the course of the 28 days, more than half a million
###1241 people will pass through the temple doors.
###1244 A heaving shantytown springs up around the
###1247 famous Yellamma shrine.
###1249 The place is filled with garish Hindu icons, Bollywood
###1252 music, sticky sweets, and the symbolic red and yellow colors
###1256 of the goddess Yellamma.
###1258 Hello.
###1259 Nice to meet you.
###1260 We're not allowed-- we're not gonna take the camera inside.
###1263 No.
###1264 
###1267 SARAH HARRIS: This is the Yellamma temple, which is like
###1269 the main attraction of Saundatti.
###1272 It's here that for hundreds and hundreds of years, all the
###1275 devadasi girls have come for their dedication ceremonies,
###1278 which are now illegal.
###1280 And we're not allowed in, so we just have to shoot from
###1282 outside, but you can see hundreds of people walking
###1286 around, praying to the goddess.
###1291 Everything around the temple is really, really colorful,
###1293 and you've got all these red and yellow dyes, which the
###1296 women put on their foreheads.
###1297 And this is to kind of
###1299 represent the goddess Yellamma.
###1300 And the green bangles are in rows all along the side of the
###1303 road here, and they're the bangles that they put on the
###1307 girls during their devadasi dedication ceremonies.
###1310 And tonight is the moon celebration, and they'll smash
###1314 their bracelets as a symbol of widowhood.
###1316 
###1320 This is also one of the places where the women traffickers
###1324 come and pick up potential prostitutes.
###1328 The brothel madams will travel from big cities like Bombay
###1332 and Pune and come to Saundatti to these festivals to pick up
###1336 young girls to traffic.
###1338 
###1342 Amidst all the religious fervor, there was a distinct
###1345 feeling of secrets going on behind closed doors.
###1349 Families are offered a generous fee in return for
###1352 their young daughters, often under the
###1354 pretense of a better future.
###1356 But it's here that the next generation of young devadasi
###1359 prostitution are found.
###1362 What we really wanted to do was watch a real dedication
###1365 ceremony, but that didn't look like it was going to happen.
###1368 And as a bunch of pasty Westerners with cameras, we
###1371 weren't exactly inconspicuous.
###1374 Luckily, we met an ex-devadasi and social
###1377 activist called Sitavva.
###1378 She agreed to stage a mock dedication ceremony to give us
###1382 an idea of what really goes on behind the scenes.
###1384 
###1387 SITAVVA: [SPEAKING KANNADA]
###1388 
###1473 SARAH HARRIS: Leaving Saundatti, we felt disturbed
###1475 by everything we'd seen.
###1477 The bright colors and energy of the festival were
###1480 overshadowed by the seedy reality of a religious
###1483 ceremony that condones child prostitution.
###1485 
###1488 Our last stop before we headed home was in the small village
###1491 of Sarol, where we'd arranged to meet three generations of
###1494 devadasi women, all from the same family.
###1497 
###1500 When we arrived, we were told that the daughter had recently
###1503 died of HIV.
###1504 
###1509 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1510 
###1606 SARAH HARRIS: India is a land of extremes, polarized by
###1609 extravagant new wealth and ancient poverty.
###1613 Everywhere you look, there's a battle being waged between the
###1616 traditional forces of religion, castes, and
###1618 superstition and the inevitable force of Western
###1622 capitalism.
###1623 Nowhere are these clashes more evident than in the plight of
###1626 the devadasis, where religious devotion has been exploited
###1630 for commercial gain.
###1632 The devadasi tradition is destroying families and
###1635 communities, generation after generation.
###1639 And with the advent of AIDS and HIV, the practice now has
###1642 a deadly price tag.
###1644 And today, any remnants of the devadasis' cultural origins
###1648 have all but disappeared.
###1651 All that's left is a system that turns children into
###1653 prostitutes and their parents into pimps.
###1656
