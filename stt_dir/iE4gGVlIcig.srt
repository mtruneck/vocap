3
0:0:11,0 --> 0:0:13,7
150 years ago,


4
0:0:13,7 --> 0:0:18,0
the business corporation was a
relatively insignificant institution.


5
0:0:18,0 --> 0:0:21,3
Today it is all pervasive like the
church, the monarchy


6
0:0:21,3 --> 0:0:25,0
and the communist party in other
times and places;


7
0:0:25,0 --> 0:0:29,0
the corporation is today's dominant
institution.


8
0:0:29,0 --> 0:0:32,3
This documentary examines the nature,


9
0:0:32,3 --> 0:0:35,5
evolution, impacts and possible future of


10
0:0:35,5 --> 0:0:38,7
the modern business corporation.


11
0:0:38,7 --> 0:0:42,7
And you should give them a narrow
legal mandate


12
0:0:42,7 --> 0:0:45,7
what has allowed today’s corporation
to achieve such extraordinary power


13
0:0:45,7 --> 0:0:48,7
and influence over our lives.


14
0:0:48,7 --> 0:0:52,0
The beginner inquiry scandals
threaten to trigger a wide debate


15
0:0:52,0 --> 0:0:55,0
about the lack of control over big corporations.


16
0:0:55,0 --> 0:1:0,0
"I think there is an overhang..."


17
0:1:0,0 --> 0:1:4,0
"over the market of distrust..."


18
0:1:4,0 --> 0:1:9,0
"there is a 95%, 100%, a huge
percentage of the business"


19
0:1:9,0 --> 0:1:12,0
"community are honest and reveal all
of their assets,"


20
0:1:12,0 --> 0:1:14,5
"their compensation programs are robust"


21
0:1:14,5 --> 0:1:18,0
"but there are some bad apples."


22
0:1:18,0 --> 0:1:21,3
The media debate about the basic
corporating principles


23
0:1:21,3 --> 0:1:25,0
of the corporate world was quickly
reduced to a game to follow the leader.


24
0:1:25,0 --> 0:1:28,3
"I still happen to think the United States
is the greatest place in the world to invest."


25
0:1:28,3 --> 0:1:36,0
"We have some shakes up that are
going on because of a few bad apples."


26
0:1:36,0 --> 0:1:41,0
"Some people call me a bad apple,"


27
0:1:41,0 --> 0:1:46,0
"well, I may be bruised but I still taste sweet."


28
0:1:46,0 --> 0:1:51,0
"Some people call me a bad apple,"


29
0:1:51,0 --> 0:1:54,3
"but I may be the sweetest apple on the tree."


30
0:1:54,3 --> 0:1:57,7
"These are not just a bunch of bad apples!"


31
0:1:57,7 --> 0:2:0,0
"This is just a few bad apples!"


32
0:2:0,0 --> 0:2:2,3
"It's not just a few bad apples!"


33
0:2:2,3 --> 0:2:6,0
"We got to get rid of the bad apples!
You can start with Tyco!"


34
0:2:6,0 --> 0:2:7,3
"Bad apples!"


35
0:2:7,3 --> 0:2:9,3
"We know all about WorldCom!
- Bad apples!"


36
0:2:9,3 --> 0:2:12,0
"Xerox corporation!
- Bad apples!"


37
0:2:12,0 --> 0:2:15,0
"Arthur Andersen. - Bad apples!
ENRON obviously! - Bad apples!"


38
0:2:15,0 --> 0:2:17,0
"K-Mart Corporation!"


39
0:2:17,0 --> 0:2:19,0
"Their car is getting a little
more full."


40
0:2:19,0 --> 0:2:21,0
"I don't think it's just a few apples
unfortunately,"


41
0:2:21,0 --> 0:2:25,0
"I think this is the worst crisis of
confidence in a business..."


42
0:2:25,0 --> 0:2:27,7
What's wrong with this picture?


43
0:2:27,7 --> 0:2:31,0
"Can we pick up a better metaphor
to describe"


44
0:2:31,0 --> 0:2:34,0
the dominant institution of our time?


45
0:2:34,0 --> 0:2:39,0
Through the voices of CEOs, whistle
blowers, brokers, gurus and spies,


46
0:2:39,0 --> 0:2:44,0
insiders and outsiders, they present
the corporation as a paradox,


47
0:2:44,0 --> 0:2:47,3
an institution that creates great
wealth but causes enormous


48
0:2:47,3 --> 0:3:5,0
and often hidden harms.


49
0:3:5,0 --> 0:3:10,5
I see the corporation as a part of
the jigsaw in society as a whole,


50
0:3:10,5 --> 0:3:14,0
which if you remove it, the picture
is incomplete


51
0:3:14,0 --> 0:3:20,0
but equally if it is the only part,
it's not going to work.


52
0:3:20,0 --> 0:3:23,0
A sports team, some of us are blocking
and tackling,


53
0:3:23,0 --> 0:3:26,3
some of us are running the ball,
some of us are throwing the ball


54
0:3:26,3 --> 0:3:31,0
but we all have a common purpose
which is to succeed as an organization.


55
0:3:31,0 --> 0:3:33,5
A corporation is like a family unit;


56
0:3:33,5 --> 0:3:41,0
people in the corporation work together
for a common end.


57
0:3:41,0 --> 0:3:45,0
Like the telephone system, it reaches
almost everywhere.


58
0:3:45,0 --> 0:3:47,5
It is extraordinarily powerful.


59
0:3:47,5 --> 0:3:52,0
It is pretty hard to avoid and it
transforms the lives of people,


60
0:3:52,0 --> 0:3:57,0
I think, on balance for the better.


61
0:3:57,0 --> 0:4:2,0
"The eagle, soaring, clear eyed..."


62
0:4:2,0 --> 0:4:7,0
"competitive, prepared to strike
but not a vulture..."


63
0:4:7,0 --> 0:4:11,0
"noble,  a visionary, majestic..."


64
0:4:11,0 --> 0:4:14,0
"that people can believe in and be
inspired by;"


65
0:4:14,0 --> 0:4:19,0
"that creates such a lift that it soars."


66
0:4:19,0 --> 0:4:26,7
"I can see that being a good logo
for the principal company."


67
0:4:26,7 --> 0:4:33,0
"Okay guys, enough bullshit!!"


68
0:4:33,0 --> 0:4:37,0
Corporations are artificial creations;


69
0:4:37,0 --> 0:4:43,0
you might say they are monsters trying
to devour as much profit as possible


70
0:4:43,0 --> 0:4:47,0
at anyone's expense.


71
0:4:47,0 --> 0:4:51,0
I think of a whale, gentle, big fish


72
0:4:51,0 --> 0:4:55,0
which can swallow you in an instant.


73
0:4:55,0 --> 0:4:58,3
Doctor Frankenstein's creation has


74
0:4:58,3 --> 0:5:1,5
overwhelmed and overpowered him


75
0:5:1,5 --> 0:5:14,0
as the corporate form has done with us.


76
0:5:14,0 --> 0:5:18,3
"The word corporate gets attached
in almost..."


77
0:5:18,3 --> 0:5:22,0
"you know, in a priority of sense to..."


78
0:5:22,0 --> 0:5:26,0
"and it gets married with the word
agenda  and one hears a lot"


79
0:5:26,0 --> 0:5:30,0
"about the word corporate agenda
as tough it is evil,"


80
0:5:30,0 --> 0:5:36,0
"as though it is an agenda which is
trying to take over the world."


81
0:5:36,0 --> 0:5:39,7
"Personally, I don't use the word
corporation,"


82
0:5:39,7 --> 0:5:45,0
I use the word business;
I would use the word...


83
0:5:45,0 --> 0:5:48,3
"I use the word company.
I'll use the word business community"


84
0:5:48,3 --> 0:5:52,0
"because I think that is a much fair
representation"


85
0:5:52,0 --> 0:6:3,0
"than zeroing on just this word 'corporation'."


86
0:6:3,0 --> 0:6:6,3
"It is funny that I taught in the
business school for as long as I have"


87
0:6:6,3 --> 0:6:10,0
"without ever having been asked
so pointedly to say"


88
0:6:10,0 --> 0:6:12,0
"what I think a corporation is."


89
0:6:12,0 --> 0:6:17,0
It is one form of business ownership.


90
0:6:17,0 --> 0:6:22,0
It's a group of individuals working
together to serve a variety


91
0:6:22,0 --> 0:6:26,0
of objectives the principle one of
which is earning large,


92
0:6:26,0 --> 0:6:29,5
growing, sustained, legal returns


93
0:6:29,5 --> 0:6:33,0
for the people who own the business.


94
0:6:33,0 --> 0:6:35,5
Hi there, this is Mark Achbar,


95
0:6:35,5 --> 0:6:38,3
I produced and co-directed the corporation


96
0:6:38,3 --> 0:6:41,5
and this is the official shareware
version of the film.


97
0:6:41,5 --> 0:6:44,0
I am proud of the fact that hundreds
of thousands of people


98
0:6:44,0 --> 0:6:47,3
have already downloaded and shared
this film.


99
0:6:47,3 --> 0:6:50,0
If I had a dollar for every download, well...,


100
0:6:50,0 --> 0:6:53,0
I probably wouldn't be making this appeal.


101
0:6:53,0 --> 0:6:56,5
More than 200 people worked on
the film, the DVD, and the website


102
0:6:56,5 --> 0:6:59,3
over 8 years.  If you support the film,


103
0:6:59,3 --> 0:7:2,0
please support the filmmakers too.


104
0:7:2,0 --> 0:7:5,3
You can make a contribution, large
or small,


105
0:7:5,3 --> 0:7:10,0
even a couple of bucks would help
at www.thecorporation.com.
