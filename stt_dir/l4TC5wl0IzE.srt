1
0:0:16,528 --> 0:0:18,704
Excelsior, this is
the shuttlecraft Sturgeon.


2
0:0:18,704 --> 0:0:20,236
Requesting docking coordinates.


3
0:0:20,236 --> 0:0:26,419
Acknowledged, Sturgeon,
you are cleared for docking.


4
0:0:26,419 --> 0:0:29,315
Don't look so worried.


5
0:0:29,315 --> 0:0:32,69
Say that one more
time, and I swear


6
0:0:32,69 --> 0:0:35,34
I'll bust you back to yeoman.


7
0:0:35,34 --> 0:0:36,633
What's on today's schedule?


8
0:0:36,633 --> 0:0:38,134
I've cleared it.


9
0:0:38,134 --> 0:0:40,7
You'll have all the time
in the world.


10
0:0:40,7 --> 0:0:42,8
Docking is complete, Excelsior.


11
0:0:42,8 --> 0:0:44,1
Copy that, Sturgeon.


12
0:0:44,1 --> 0:0:45,8
Welcome aboard.


13
0:0:45,8 --> 0:0:57,734
All the time in the world...


14
0:0:57,734 --> 0:1:1,734
Tracking hydrogen-antihydrogen
reaction signatures, Captain.


15
0:1:1,734 --> 0:1:6,734
There's no doubt
they're venting antimatter.


16
0:1:6,734 --> 0:1:10,267
Maximum resolution.


17
0:1:10,267 --> 0:1:11,734
Range, Mr. Sulu?


18
0:1:11,734 --> 0:1:14,67
29 million kilometers, Captain.


19
0:1:14,67 --> 0:1:16,134
They've drifted well within
the Romulan Neutral Zone.


20
0:1:16,134 --> 0:1:17,667
Another distress signal,
Captain.


21
0:1:17,667 --> 0:1:19,633
They say they're losing
life support fast.


22
0:1:19,633 --> 0:1:22,167
Mr. Sulu,
plot an intercept course.


23
0:1:22,167 --> 0:1:26,167
I want us in and out
before anybody's the wiser.


24
0:1:26,167 --> 0:1:29,134
Ever taken the
Kobayashi Maru test?


25
0:1:29,134 --> 0:1:31,667
Course plotted and
laid in, Captain.


26
0:1:31,667 --> 0:1:32,867
Full ahead.


27
0:1:32,867 --> 0:1:38,667
Aye, sir.


28
0:1:38,667 --> 0:1:43,909
Entering Romulan
Neutral Zone.


29
0:1:43,909 --> 0:1:45,234
We are now in violation
of treaty.


30
0:1:45,234 --> 0:1:47,34
Then let's not let any grass...


31
0:1:47,34 --> 0:1:48,667
Captain, warp field
signatures approaching.


32
0:1:48,667 --> 0:1:49,8
Dropping to sublight.


33
0:1:49,8 --> 0:1:53,201
On screen.


34
0:1:53,201 --> 0:1:54,734
Romulan birds-of-prey,


35
0:1:54,734 --> 0:2:3,867
Imperator class.


36
0:2:3,867 --> 0:2:6,734
Detecting a build-up of
hyperphasic energy, Captain,


37
0:2:6,734 --> 0:2:15,167
in a triangulated pattern.


38
0:2:15,167 --> 0:2:30,334
All decks-- Red Alert!


39
0:2:30,334 --> 0:2:32,434
Space--


40
0:2:32,434 --> 0:2:39,3
the final frontier.


41
0:2:39,3 --> 0:2:43,67
These are the new voyages
of the Starship Enterprise,


42
0:2:43,67 --> 0:2:47,234
its five-year mission
to explore strange new worlds,


43
0:2:47,234 --> 0:2:51,133
to seek out new life
and new civilizations,


44
0:2:51,133 --> 0:3:34,2
to boldly go where
no man has gone before.


45
0:3:34,2 --> 0:3:36,234
Spock!
What the hell just happened?


46
0:3:36,234 --> 0:3:38,1
The merchant vessel has been...


47
0:3:38,1 --> 0:3:40,534
annihilated, Captain.


48
0:3:40,534 --> 0:3:42,67
There is nothing left.


49
0:3:42,67 --> 0:3:44,133
Its very atoms
have been ripped apart.


50
0:3:44,133 --> 0:3:45,367
Get us out of here, Sulu.


51
0:3:45,367 --> 0:3:52,834
Yes, sir!


52
0:3:52,834 --> 0:3:54,367
Captain, I'm getting encrypted
ship-to-ship


53
0:3:54,367 --> 0:3:55,567
between the Romulan vessels.


54
0:3:55,567 --> 0:3:56,701
Fortuitously, in a code


55
0:3:56,701 --> 0:4:2,944
they are unaware
that we have previously broken.


56
0:4:2,944 --> 0:4:3,534
As I suspected.


57
0:4:3,534 --> 0:4:6,33
The merchant vessel was
destroyed by a new weapon,


58
0:4:6,33 --> 0:4:7,601
most likely a prototype.


59
0:4:7,601 --> 0:4:8,734
Captain...


60
0:4:8,734 --> 0:4:19,3
they've spotted us.


61
0:4:19,3 --> 0:4:21,601
They're building energy again.
We have only seconds before...


62
0:4:21,601 --> 0:4:24,3
Chekov, target those
vessels and fire!


63
0:4:24,3 --> 0:4:47,3
Targeting... firing phasers.


64
0:4:47,3 --> 0:4:48,501
Damage report.


65
0:4:48,501 --> 0:4:51,1
Minimal, Captain-- mostly from
shifts in our gravity field.


66
0:4:51,1 --> 0:4:52,567
Analysis, Spock.


67
0:4:52,567 --> 0:4:53,634
Shields are holding.


68
0:4:53,634 --> 0:4:55,634
We are safe for the
moment-- but trapped.


69
0:4:55,634 --> 0:4:57,33
Trapped.


70
0:4:57,33 --> 0:4:58,1
How?


71
0:4:58,1 --> 0:5:5,67
We appear to be caught in
a hyperdimensional field.


72
0:5:5,67 --> 0:5:9,0
The field is producing
gravity waves...


73
0:5:9,0 --> 0:5:10,501
...ripples in the space-time
continuum.


74
0:5:10,501 --> 0:5:15,267
This is a strange definition
of "safe," Mr. Spock.


75
0:5:15,267 --> 0:5:16,734
Lieutenant Uhura,


76
0:5:16,734 --> 0:5:19,501
send out a subspace message
to the Romulan High Command,


77
0:5:19,501 --> 0:5:21,634
in their encrypted code:


78
0:5:21,634 --> 0:5:23,67
Weapons test a failure.


79
0:5:23,67 --> 0:5:25,634
Our own ships destroyed.


80
0:5:25,634 --> 0:5:28,601
Core breach... imminent.


81
0:5:28,601 --> 0:5:30,634
Aye, sir.


82
0:5:30,634 --> 0:5:32,267
We might at least dissuade them


83
0:5:32,267 --> 0:5:33,734
from trying it again,
anytime soon.


84
0:5:33,734 --> 0:5:35,701
Most logical.


85
0:5:35,701 --> 0:5:37,234
Thank you, Mr. Spock.


86
0:5:37,234 --> 0:5:40,567
You, Bones and Scotty
in conference now.


87
0:5:40,567 --> 0:5:49,434
Mr. Sulu, you have the Conn.


88
0:5:49,434 --> 0:5:51,234
Isn't the Kobayashi Maru


89
0:5:51,234 --> 0:5:53,67
supposed to be
a "no-win" scenario?


90
0:5:53,67 --> 0:5:58,4
Let's hope not.


91
0:5:58,4 --> 0:5:59,734
The field apparently


92
0:5:59,734 --> 0:6:1,467
creates a quantum disruption


93
0:6:1,467 --> 0:6:4,667
that negates the strong and
weak forces binding atoms.


94
0:6:4,667 --> 0:6:8,467
Anything caught within it
simply ceases to exist.


95
0:6:8,467 --> 0:6:9,701
And this is going
to happen to us?


96
0:6:9,701 --> 0:6:12,133
At the moment, our shields
are protecting us.


97
0:6:12,133 --> 0:6:14,334
But the power drain
is considerable.


98
0:6:14,334 --> 0:6:17,67
How much time?
No more than 20 hours.


99
0:6:17,67 --> 0:6:19,4
I cannot say for sure, the
way the levels keep changing.


100
0:6:19,4 --> 0:6:21,234
And we can't use full warp power
to escape?


101
0:6:21,234 --> 0:6:23,0
Ineffective.


102
0:6:23,0 --> 0:6:25,267
Due to the field,
we are in the grip of not four,


103
0:6:25,267 --> 0:6:27,33
but considerably
more dimensions.


104
0:6:27,33 --> 0:6:28,501
We would need
accurate coordinates


105
0:6:28,501 --> 0:6:29,734
for all of them


106
0:6:29,734 --> 0:6:32,501
in order to effectively
extricate ourselves.


107
0:6:32,501 --> 0:6:34,701
And without the data on how
the field was generated,


108
0:6:34,701 --> 0:6:37,4
the computer doesn't stand a
chance of plotting a course out.


109
0:6:37,4 --> 0:6:40,67
Is it possible the bird-of-prey
has the data?


110
0:6:40,67 --> 0:6:42,634
If the computer banks
are still intact...


111
0:6:42,634 --> 0:6:44,234
but we can't access them
from here.


112
0:6:44,234 --> 0:6:46,601
And with the field fluctuating
to hell and back,


113
0:6:46,601 --> 0:6:49,33
I wouldn't dare trust
the transporters.


114
0:6:49,33 --> 0:6:50,334
A shuttlecraft, then.


115
0:6:50,334 --> 0:6:51,501
Wouldn't it be destroyed?


116
0:6:51,501 --> 0:6:53,234
I believe we can
extend the shields out


117
0:6:53,234 --> 0:6:58,767
far enough to protect it.


118
0:6:58,767 --> 0:6:59,968
Mr. Sulu.


119
0:6:59,968 --> 0:7:1,4
Aye, sir?


120
0:7:1,4 --> 0:7:3,33
We're going to need
some fancy piloting


121
0:7:3,33 --> 0:7:4,701
if we're going to get
out of this mess,


122
0:7:4,701 --> 0:7:8,33
with a few extra-dimensional
coordinates thrown in.


123
0:7:8,33 --> 0:7:9,534
Are you up for it?


124
0:7:9,534 --> 0:7:12,767
When do I start?


125
0:7:12,767 --> 0:7:15,634
Captain's Log,
Stardate 6283.6.


126
0:7:15,634 --> 0:7:18,1
The Enterprise is caught
like a fly in amber,


127
0:7:18,1 --> 0:7:20,267
in a tangle of multiple
dimensions.


128
0:7:20,267 --> 0:7:22,567
Our only hope of survival lies
in obtaining data


129
0:7:22,567 --> 0:7:24,467
from the remaining
Romulan bird-of-prey


130
0:7:24,467 --> 0:7:27,634
that might help us chart
a course back to normal space.


131
0:7:27,634 --> 0:7:29,334
I have detailed Lieutenant Sulu


132
0:7:29,334 --> 0:7:31,701
to pilot a shuttlecraft
to the derelict ship,


133
0:7:31,701 --> 0:7:35,467
accompanied by an expert
in Romulan computer science.


134
0:7:35,467 --> 0:7:38,133
Sorry, sorry.


135
0:7:38,133 --> 0:7:40,3
You know, we are kind of
on the clock here.


136
0:7:40,3 --> 0:7:43,133
I couldn't get into
this damn thing.


137
0:7:43,133 --> 0:7:46,367
Lisa Chandris, computer science,
xeno-cryptography.


138
0:7:46,367 --> 0:7:48,601
Hikaru Sulu, helmsman.


139
0:7:48,601 --> 0:7:51,634
I know; I saw you on the bridge,
when I came aboard


140
0:7:51,634 --> 0:7:53,501
and presented my orders
to the captain.


141
0:7:53,501 --> 0:7:55,4
I got here, like,
three days ago,


142
0:7:55,4 --> 0:7:57,234
when you guys docked
at Altair IV.


143
0:7:57,234 --> 0:8:31,167
Well, you're certainly starting
things off with a bang.


144
0:8:31,167 --> 0:8:43,841
Keep them safe,
Mr. Scott.


145
0:8:43,841 --> 0:8:46,394
What was that?


146
0:8:46,394 --> 0:8:49,367
Gravity wave.


147
0:8:49,367 --> 0:8:51,267
One of the first things
they ask you


148
0:8:51,267 --> 0:8:53,0
when you sign on
for starship duty


149
0:8:53,0 --> 0:8:57,5
is if you're prone
to space sickness.


150
0:8:57,5 --> 0:8:59,419
I lied.


151
0:8:59,419 --> 0:9:2,77
We'll be back with the data
before you know it.


152
0:9:2,77 --> 0:9:4,8
If our shields don't fail,


153
0:9:4,8 --> 0:9:6,813
and if that bird-of-prey
isn't torn to quarks


154
0:9:6,813 --> 0:9:8,399
with us aboard it.


155
0:9:8,399 --> 0:9:11,0
That about sums it up.


156
0:9:11,0 --> 0:9:13,913
And that doesn't
bother you, huh?


157
0:9:13,913 --> 0:9:59,161
It certainly motivates me.


158
0:9:59,161 --> 0:10:2,162
Sorry if I parked too far
from the curb, Doctor.


159
0:10:2,162 --> 0:10:21,767
You're a real
cowboy, you are.


160
0:10:21,767 --> 0:10:30,97
Careful. Gravity's unstable.


161
0:10:30,97 --> 0:10:31,668
Computer's on
a separate power grid,


162
0:10:31,668 --> 0:10:33,769
so I should be able to...


163
0:10:33,769 --> 0:10:34,943
Okay, we're on line.


164
0:10:34,943 --> 0:10:37,888
Now all we have to do
is locate the specific data


165
0:10:37,888 --> 0:10:40,443
on the weapons system.


166
0:10:40,443 --> 0:10:44,466
Ah, here we are.


167
0:10:44,466 --> 0:10:46,86
Of course!


168
0:10:46,86 --> 0:10:48,99
This making sense
to you?


169
0:10:48,99 --> 0:10:50,27
It's complex, but yes.


170
0:10:50,27 --> 0:10:51,761
Good.


171
0:10:51,761 --> 0:10:54,433
I'd hate to have gone
to all this trouble for nothing.


172
0:10:54,433 --> 0:11:7,207
I mean... almost nothing...


173
0:11:7,207 --> 0:11:8,273
Spock?


174
0:11:8,273 --> 0:11:9,642
Gravity waves, Captain.


175
0:11:9,642 --> 0:11:10,973
Increasing intensity.


176
0:11:10,973 --> 0:11:13,818
They could destabilize the
bird-of-prey's reactor core.


177
0:11:13,818 --> 0:11:31,853
Sulu! You and Chandris
get out of there now!


178
0:11:31,853 --> 0:11:37,1
Enterprise! Can you hear us?
Enterprise!


179
0:11:37,1 --> 0:11:38,801
Bird-of-prey reactor core
going critical!


180
0:11:38,801 --> 0:11:40,734
Scotty! Keep the shields
extended around that ship


181
0:11:40,734 --> 0:11:43,668
and beam Sulu and Chandris
back through!


182
0:11:43,668 --> 0:11:45,485
I'll give it my best, Captain.


183
0:11:45,485 --> 0:11:51,567
Spock! Bones!


184
0:11:51,567 --> 0:12:4,734
Gravity waves are makin' it
devilish hard to lock onto them.


185
0:12:4,734 --> 0:12:6,133
The core just blew!


186
0:12:6,133 --> 0:12:8,1
Massive subspace interference.


187
0:12:8,1 --> 0:12:9,392
I cannot hang onto them!


188
0:12:9,392 --> 0:12:11,801
Wait. There's a signal.


189
0:12:11,801 --> 0:12:13,734
One's caught in
the pattern buffer.


190
0:12:13,734 --> 0:12:18,601
Looks to be Sulu,
but something's nee right.


191
0:12:18,601 --> 0:13:11,9
You're not
gettin' away now, lad.


192
0:13:11,9 --> 0:13:16,7
You will stand down now, sir.


193
0:13:16,7 --> 0:13:18,601
You will stand down.


194
0:13:18,601 --> 0:13:25,967
And see, I believe,
that you know us.


195
0:13:25,967 --> 0:13:31,267
Captain Kirk...


196
0:13:31,267 --> 0:13:32,6
Dr. McCoy...


197
0:13:32,6 --> 0:13:34,867
Bones.


198
0:13:34,867 --> 0:13:36,667
You're the same...


199
0:13:36,667 --> 0:13:38,867
How can you be the same?


200
0:13:38,867 --> 0:13:42,533
DNA and vitals
match Sulu's, but...


201
0:13:42,533 --> 0:13:46,767
Jim-- he's 30 years older.


202
0:13:46,767 --> 0:13:49,28
Mr. Sulu, you've been gone
less than a minute.


203
0:13:49,28 --> 0:13:50,962
The Romulan ship
went critical


204
0:13:50,962 --> 0:13:52,6
and we tried to beam
you both back...


205
0:13:52,6 --> 0:13:54,34
Oh, my God!


206
0:13:54,34 --> 0:13:57,5
She's all alone back there!


207
0:13:57,5 --> 0:13:58,767
You've got to get her!


208
0:13:58,767 --> 0:13:59,934
You've got to
bring her here!


209
0:13:59,934 --> 0:14:1,9
We lost Dr. Chandris' signal.


210
0:14:1,9 --> 0:14:4,134
Not Lisa! Lisa's dead!


211
0:14:4,134 --> 0:14:6,248
She died 15 years ago.


212
0:14:6,248 --> 0:14:7,468
Captain!


213
0:14:7,468 --> 0:14:11,134
I'm picking up another signal,
faint as a whisper...


214
0:14:11,134 --> 0:14:12,16
Dr. Chandris?


215
0:14:12,16 --> 0:14:14,1
Doesn't match her signature.


216
0:14:14,1 --> 0:14:15,468
Something else.


217
0:14:15,468 --> 0:14:16,767
Lock in on it!


218
0:14:16,767 --> 0:14:17,529
I'd do a fair bit better


219
0:14:17,529 --> 0:14:19,985
if you'd stop shoutin' and
flailin' cutlasses about!


220
0:14:19,985 --> 0:14:23,9
Aw, you're a right will
o' the wisp, you are...


221
0:14:23,9 --> 0:14:32,34
but you won't be gettin' away.


222
0:14:32,34 --> 0:14:45,913
Alana, don't be afraid.


223
0:14:45,913 --> 0:14:46,905
Bring her back!


224
0:14:46,905 --> 0:14:48,442
I've got her pattern
in the matrix.


225
0:14:48,442 --> 0:14:50,5
She won't be gettin' away.


226
0:14:50,5 --> 0:14:53,587
But she's not exactly arrivin'
here yet, either.


227
0:14:53,587 --> 0:14:57,5
I'll have to rig up some sort of
stasis chamber to keep her here.


228
0:14:57,5 --> 0:14:58,376
At least, for starters.


229
0:14:58,376 --> 0:15:0,807
You called her Alana.
Who is she?


230
0:15:0,807 --> 0:15:5,767
She's my daughter.


231
0:15:5,767 --> 0:15:7,68
Status.


232
0:15:7,68 --> 0:15:8,0
Shields at maximum, sir.


233
0:15:8,0 --> 0:15:9,82
We've diverted power
from all but life support.


234
0:15:9,82 --> 0:15:12,267
We're holding our own,
but we're not going anywhere.


235
0:15:12,267 --> 0:15:13,567
Understood.


236
0:15:13,567 --> 0:15:17,267
Report, Commander.


237
0:15:17,267 --> 0:15:23,867
Sulu, just tell
us what you know.


238
0:15:23,867 --> 0:15:27,434
Lisa and I were aboard
the bird-of-prey.


239
0:15:27,434 --> 0:15:31,68
It was about to explode when
the transporter seized us.


240
0:15:31,68 --> 0:15:34,167
Instead of materializing
on the Enterprise,


241
0:15:34,167 --> 0:15:38,267
we found ourselves
on the surface of a planet.


242
0:15:38,267 --> 0:15:40,734
Clearly one with some form
of civilization,


243
0:15:40,734 --> 0:15:44,12
given your elaborate...
ornamentation.


244
0:15:44,12 --> 0:15:46,567
A dead world, Mr. Spock.


245
0:15:46,567 --> 0:15:49,721
Disease had wiped them out
centuries ago.


246
0:15:49,721 --> 0:15:52,279
Nothing but ruined cities,


247
0:15:52,279 --> 0:15:54,77
what remained of a...


248
0:15:54,77 --> 0:15:55,667
canal system...


249
0:15:55,667 --> 0:15:59,633
desert that stretched forever.


250
0:15:59,633 --> 0:16:3,7
There was wildlife, fruits.


251
0:16:3,7 --> 0:16:5,777
We were able to survive.


252
0:16:5,777 --> 0:16:8,607
And in time, you and Chandris...


253
0:16:8,607 --> 0:16:13,152
There comes a point where one
has to start living a life--


254
0:16:13,152 --> 0:16:18,13
whatever it is-- rather than
waiting for one to begin.


255
0:16:18,13 --> 0:16:20,34
But what was
30 years to you


256
0:16:20,34 --> 0:16:21,845
was 30 seconds to us.


257
0:16:21,845 --> 0:16:22,973
Fascinating.


258
0:16:22,973 --> 0:16:25,625
It would appear
that the gravitational waves,


259
0:16:25,625 --> 0:16:27,794
interacting with the
multi-dimensional field,


260
0:16:27,794 --> 0:16:29,424
diverted you and Dr. Chandris


261
0:16:29,424 --> 0:16:31,622
into a different,
more rapid timestream--


262
0:16:31,622 --> 0:16:34,236
perhaps a wholly different
universe.


263
0:16:34,236 --> 0:16:35,479
Mr. Sulu,


264
0:16:35,479 --> 0:16:37,437
this ship will be torn
to subatomic particles


265
0:16:37,437 --> 0:16:38,468
in a matter of hours,


266
0:16:38,468 --> 0:16:39,867
We need that data


267
0:16:39,867 --> 0:16:41,723
that you and Dr. Chandris
got off that ship.


268
0:16:41,723 --> 0:16:46,6
The tricorder's back on Caliban.


269
0:16:46,6 --> 0:16:48,996
We had to name the planet
something.


270
0:16:48,996 --> 0:16:51,397
It seemed to fit.


271
0:16:51,397 --> 0:16:52,555
It's from Shakespeare...


272
0:16:52,555 --> 0:16:54,7
The Tempest.


273
0:16:54,7 --> 0:16:56,382
Sulu, do you
remember anything


274
0:16:56,382 --> 0:16:57,667
from the Romulan data?


275
0:16:57,667 --> 0:17:0,8
It's been so long.


276
0:17:0,8 --> 0:17:5,834
I...


277
0:17:5,834 --> 0:17:9,267
No.


278
0:17:9,267 --> 0:17:12,734
When the tricorder's
power started to fail,


279
0:17:12,734 --> 0:17:16,201
I tried to hold
the information in my mind.


280
0:17:16,201 --> 0:17:18,79
But after months...


281
0:17:18,79 --> 0:17:21,9
years...


282
0:17:21,9 --> 0:17:26,255
Lisa thought...
you had all died.


283
0:17:26,255 --> 0:17:28,767
But I said,
"You don't know James Kirk.


284
0:17:28,767 --> 0:17:32,877
"He always manages to snatch
life from the jaws of death.


285
0:17:32,877 --> 0:17:34,136
He'll find a way."


286
0:17:34,136 --> 0:17:36,468
You're that way, Sulu.


287
0:17:36,468 --> 0:17:40,234
We need that data.


288
0:17:40,234 --> 0:17:45,867
Captain...


289
0:17:45,867 --> 0:17:47,251
Kirk here.


290
0:17:47,251 --> 0:17:48,9
If you fine gentlemen


291
0:17:48,9 --> 0:17:50,834
could tear yourselves away
from your pressin' business...


292
0:17:50,834 --> 0:17:57,134
there's someone here
I'd like you to meet.


293
0:17:57,134 --> 0:17:58,371
Father!


294
0:17:58,371 --> 0:18:1,8
It's all right, Alana.


295
0:18:1,8 --> 0:18:5,201
Why is she still insubstantial?


296
0:18:5,201 --> 0:18:7,4
Best I can do
for now, Captain.


297
0:18:7,4 --> 0:18:8,877
A good part of her's
still linked


298
0:18:8,877 --> 0:18:10,99
to whatever godforsaken rock
you were livin' on.


299
0:18:10,99 --> 0:18:14,567
She appears to exist in a state
of quantum indeterminacy;


300
0:18:14,567 --> 0:18:17,119
partly here,
in our universe,


301
0:18:17,119 --> 0:18:19,84
partly still in
the alternate universe.


302
0:18:19,84 --> 0:18:22,7
That's impossible.


303
0:18:22,7 --> 0:18:25,5
I suggest we make a datachip
record of these events.


304
0:18:25,5 --> 0:18:27,447
It could prove invaluable
to science.


305
0:18:27,447 --> 0:18:40,6
Welcome to the Enterprise.


306
0:18:40,6 --> 0:18:42,943
They came.


307
0:18:42,943 --> 0:18:45,734
They came for us.


308
0:18:45,734 --> 0:18:48,6
Just like you said they would.


309
0:18:48,6 --> 0:18:51,636
Captain, there are urgent
matters we need to attend to.


310
0:18:51,636 --> 0:18:53,2
I understand, Mr. Spock.


311
0:18:53,2 --> 0:18:56,99
As soon as we're clear of
this hyperspatial beastie,


312
0:18:56,99 --> 0:18:58,569
we should be able
to divert enough power


313
0:18:58,569 --> 0:18:59,967
to bring you
all the way through.


314
0:18:59,967 --> 0:19:1,729
For now, unfortunately,


315
0:19:1,729 --> 0:19:3,263
your movements are limited
to this chamber.


316
0:19:3,263 --> 0:19:5,728
We'll see if we can arrange
some introductions later.


317
0:19:5,728 --> 0:19:6,85
Miss...


318
0:19:6,85 --> 0:19:8,208
Sulu?


319
0:19:8,208 --> 0:19:10,67
Alana, please.


320
0:19:10,67 --> 0:19:11,997
You're Captain Kirk, aren't you?


321
0:19:11,997 --> 0:19:12,998
How did you know?


322
0:19:12,998 --> 0:19:15,167
My father told me
you were impressive...


323
0:19:15,167 --> 0:19:18,7
...and knew it.


324
0:19:18,7 --> 0:19:22,967
You'll have to excuse her,
Captain...


325
0:19:22,967 --> 0:19:25,672
There's no apologies necessary.


326
0:19:25,672 --> 0:19:30,834
Mr. Sulu,
we'll need you in sickbay.


327
0:19:30,834 --> 0:19:33,218
I'll try not
to keep him long.


328
0:19:33,218 --> 0:19:35,6
A pleasure meeting you.


329
0:19:35,6 --> 0:19:39,8
Bones, Spock,
you're with me.


330
0:19:39,8 --> 0:19:49,7
I'll be back soon.


331
0:19:49,7 --> 0:19:52,178
People move so quickly here.


332
0:19:52,178 --> 0:19:55,9
Aye, that they do, lass.


333
0:19:55,9 --> 0:19:58,8
You're Montgomery Scott,
aren't you?


334
0:19:58,8 --> 0:20:1,9
My father told me
about you, too.


335
0:20:1,9 --> 0:20:2,986
And just what did he tell you?


336
0:20:2,986 --> 0:20:8,934
That he wouldn't want
to be your liver.


337
0:20:8,934 --> 0:20:11,834
It's good
to have him back.


338
0:20:11,834 --> 0:20:16,867
And to be meetin'
his fine fair daughter.


339
0:20:16,867 --> 0:20:19,741
Although you no longer
consciously retain


340
0:20:19,741 --> 0:20:21,119
the hyperspatial
coordinates,


341
0:20:21,119 --> 0:20:23,41
your mind still
retains the data.


342
0:20:23,41 --> 0:20:27,385
So... the famous
Vulcan mind-meld.


343
0:20:27,385 --> 0:20:31,667
I won't tell you
this is without risk.


344
0:20:31,667 --> 0:20:38,5
But then, what in life is?


345
0:20:38,5 --> 0:20:41,753
Shouldn't you send me
candy and flowers first?


346
0:20:41,753 --> 0:20:45,533
I do not understand.


347
0:20:45,533 --> 0:20:51,1
No, I didn't think you would.


348
0:20:51,1 --> 0:20:56,7
My thoughts to
your thoughts...


349
0:20:56,7 --> 0:21:1,7
Sulu, relax.
Don't fight it.


350
0:21:1,7 --> 0:21:5,468
My mind to your mind.


351
0:21:5,468 --> 0:21:7,533
Yes...


352
0:21:7,533 --> 0:21:13,95
Our minds are merging,
becoming one...


353
0:21:13,95 --> 0:21:15,6
Yes.


354
0:21:15,6 --> 0:21:18,667
The Romulan ship.


355
0:21:18,667 --> 0:21:22,633
Dr. Chandris...


356
0:21:22,633 --> 0:21:25,639
Alana...


357
0:21:25,639 --> 0:21:28,6
A child...


358
0:21:28,6 --> 0:21:31,78
ten years old...


359
0:21:31,78 --> 0:21:32,616
What... What's...


360
0:21:32,616 --> 0:21:34,593
sand... moving...


361
0:21:34,593 --> 0:21:36,734
Rising up...


362
0:21:36,734 --> 0:21:39,567
Alana!


363
0:21:39,567 --> 0:21:43,238
Sand demon!
Fangs! Spurs!


364
0:21:43,238 --> 0:21:44,314
It has her!


365
0:21:44,314 --> 0:21:48,128
Too far! Too far!
I can't...!


366
0:21:48,128 --> 0:21:49,735
Jim! Their vitals
are spiking!


367
0:21:49,735 --> 0:21:52,85
Lisa! She's killing it!


368
0:21:52,85 --> 0:21:55,101
She's cutting it to pieces!


369
0:21:55,101 --> 0:21:58,224
But it's stabbing...
stabbing her!


370
0:21:58,224 --> 0:22:2,834
LISA!


371
0:22:2,834 --> 0:22:4,65
You saved her...


372
0:22:4,65 --> 0:22:6,872
You saved our daughter...


373
0:22:6,872 --> 0:22:9,495
She heard me...


374
0:22:9,495 --> 0:22:12,117
I know she heard me...


375
0:22:12,117 --> 0:22:14,757
Epinephrine level's
off the scale.


376
0:22:14,757 --> 0:22:16,847
Blood pressure's
through the roof.


377
0:22:16,847 --> 0:22:17,934
You have to stop it!


378
0:22:17,934 --> 0:22:20,873
Stop it now-- before
we lose them both!


379
0:22:20,873 --> 0:22:22,663
Spock! Break it off!


380
0:22:22,663 --> 0:22:28,167
Spock!


381
0:22:28,167 --> 0:22:30,633
The data?


382
0:22:30,633 --> 0:22:44,867
Too deep.


383
0:22:44,867 --> 0:22:51,767
It's clear we'll have to find
another way.


384
0:22:51,767 --> 0:22:53,406
How is he?


385
0:22:53,406 --> 0:22:54,5
Resting.


386
0:22:54,5 --> 0:22:57,134
He'll need some time
to recover.


387
0:22:57,134 --> 0:23:1,375
My God, Jim,
what he's been through...


388
0:23:1,375 --> 0:23:3,5
Laudable as
your tendency


389
0:23:3,5 --> 0:23:5,397
toward compassion may be,
Doctor,


390
0:23:5,397 --> 0:23:7,67
it does not alter
the fact


391
0:23:7,67 --> 0:23:8,458
that the ship
will be destroyed


392
0:23:8,458 --> 0:23:10,16
if we do not get
that data soon.


393
0:23:10,16 --> 0:23:12,86
How can that green blood
of yours be so cold?


394
0:23:12,86 --> 0:23:13,966
Dr. McCoy...


395
0:23:13,966 --> 0:23:16,159
Bones, we need an alternative.


396
0:23:16,159 --> 0:23:18,973
Well, there are drugs,
hypnotics.


397
0:23:18,973 --> 0:23:21,131
They might work.


398
0:23:21,131 --> 0:23:23,454
Normally, I'd advise against it.


399
0:23:23,454 --> 0:23:26,435
These are not normal
circumstances.


400
0:23:26,435 --> 0:23:27,99
Do it.


401
0:23:27,99 --> 0:23:29,708
They're not
standard issue.


402
0:23:29,708 --> 0:23:32,106
It'll take me time
to formulate them.


403
0:23:32,106 --> 0:23:35,446
In the meantime, I want you
to get on with Plan B.


404
0:23:35,446 --> 0:23:39,81
I was unaware we had a Plan B.


405
0:23:39,81 --> 0:23:41,483
I trust you will shortly.


406
0:23:41,483 --> 0:23:43,175
Understood.


407
0:23:43,175 --> 0:23:46,535
Tell me, Captain, what did you
do before you knew me?


408
0:23:46,535 --> 0:23:50,633
I always made sure
Plan A worked.


409
0:23:50,633 --> 0:23:53,1
Ah.


410
0:23:53,1 --> 0:23:56,11
While we're at it,


411
0:23:56,11 --> 0:23:58,816
maybe you can arrange
for a shave and haircut,


412
0:23:58,816 --> 0:24:0,354
and rustle up
a uniform for him.


413
0:24:0,354 --> 0:24:2,139
It's the least we can do.


414
0:24:2,139 --> 0:24:3,242
I wouldn't.


415
0:24:3,242 --> 0:24:5,79
As far as he's concerned,


416
0:24:5,79 --> 0:24:7,301
his tour of duty ended
30 years ago.


417
0:24:7,301 --> 0:24:10,633
He's not the man he was.


418
0:24:10,633 --> 0:24:13,101
I understand.


419
0:24:13,101 --> 0:24:16,267
Captain Kirk to the bridge!


420
0:24:16,267 --> 0:24:17,881
Kirk here.


421
0:24:17,881 --> 0:24:19,48
The gravitational disturbances


422
0:24:19,48 --> 0:24:21,748
are increasing faster
than anticipated, Captain.


423
0:24:21,748 --> 0:24:23,242
We're runnin' out of time.


424
0:24:23,242 --> 0:24:26,633
Understood.
Go to Yellow Alert. Kirk out.


425
0:24:26,633 --> 0:24:29,84
If we're going
to get out of this,


426
0:24:29,84 --> 0:24:42,133
I have a feeling we're going
to need the man that he was.


427
0:24:42,133 --> 0:24:46,272
Captain, I've been monitoring
fluctuations in the hyperfield.


428
0:24:46,272 --> 0:24:48,2
And?


429
0:24:48,2 --> 0:24:51,197
There is the possibility that,


430
0:24:51,197 --> 0:24:54,255
were we able to generate a
matter-antimatter negation burst


431
0:24:54,255 --> 0:24:55,86
of adequate force
to free us,


432
0:24:55,86 --> 0:24:58,534
we might cause the field
to implode.


433
0:24:58,534 --> 0:25:0,378
And risk imploding the ship
as well.


434
0:25:0,378 --> 0:25:3,225
Our calculations
must be most precise.


435
0:25:3,225 --> 0:25:4,663
How much time do we have?


436
0:25:4,663 --> 0:25:7,168
14 hours, 32 minutes
and 24...


437
0:25:7,168 --> 0:25:16,501
Then I suggest you start
exploring it aggressively.


438
0:25:16,501 --> 0:25:20,634
Didn't even give you
an ocean view.


439
0:25:20,634 --> 0:25:23,616
I'd complain to the management.


440
0:25:23,616 --> 0:25:25,924
Oh, Father, it's wonderful.


441
0:25:25,924 --> 0:25:28,552
You haven't seen much of it yet.


442
0:25:28,552 --> 0:25:30,3
That doesn't matter.


443
0:25:30,3 --> 0:25:32,167
We're here.


444
0:25:32,167 --> 0:25:35,1
I just wish Mother
could have seen it.


445
0:25:35,1 --> 0:25:40,1
She would have given everything
just for you to see it, Alana.


446
0:25:40,1 --> 0:25:42,467
This is only the beginning.


447
0:25:42,467 --> 0:25:46,953
Scotty will have you flesh and
blood in no time, you'll see.


448
0:25:46,953 --> 0:25:49,212
And then...


449
0:25:49,212 --> 0:25:55,521
Centauri III,
the Valles Marineris on Mars,


450
0:25:55,521 --> 0:25:58,786
San Francisco--


451
0:25:58,786 --> 0:26:1,214
all the places
I've told you about.


452
0:26:1,214 --> 0:26:4,133
We'll roll them out
like a red carpet.


453
0:26:4,133 --> 0:26:6,678
You can go anywhere,


454
0:26:6,678 --> 0:26:8,367
do anything.


455
0:26:8,367 --> 0:26:10,6
The whole universe


456
0:26:10,6 --> 0:26:16,267
is ahead of you.


457
0:26:16,267 --> 0:26:18,234
Forgive the intrusion.


458
0:26:18,234 --> 0:26:20,667
Dr. McCoy's
ready for you.


459
0:26:20,667 --> 0:26:28,667
I'll be back soon.


460
0:26:28,667 --> 0:26:29,701
Captain...


461
0:26:29,701 --> 0:26:37,2
I expect you
to behave yourself.


462
0:26:37,2 --> 0:26:40,1
Your father always had
a distinctive sense of humor.


463
0:26:40,1 --> 0:26:43,33
Your reputation precedes
you, Captain Kirk.


464
0:26:43,33 --> 0:26:45,3
Call me Jim.


465
0:26:45,3 --> 0:26:49,534
And just what exactly
did he tell you about me?


466
0:26:49,534 --> 0:26:51,2
How alone you were.


467
0:26:51,2 --> 0:26:56,67
He told you I was lonely?


468
0:26:56,67 --> 0:27:0,1
Well, that is the price
of command.


469
0:27:0,1 --> 0:27:2,434
It was more than that.


470
0:27:2,434 --> 0:27:5,467
It was something
you carried with you...


471
0:27:5,467 --> 0:27:9,0
a distance...


472
0:27:9,0 --> 0:27:12,167
Always a
different girl on every world,


473
0:27:12,167 --> 0:27:16,2
none mattering
beyond the moment.


474
0:27:16,2 --> 0:27:20,467
There was one who was different.


475
0:27:20,467 --> 0:27:29,601
Her name... Edith.


476
0:27:29,601 --> 0:27:31,567
Some things
are best forgotten.


477
0:27:31,567 --> 0:27:33,3
I don't talk about the past,


478
0:27:33,3 --> 0:27:34,541
and your father shouldn't have,
either.


479
0:27:34,541 --> 0:27:37,12
I-I hurt you.


480
0:27:37,12 --> 0:27:39,567
I'm sorry.


481
0:27:39,567 --> 0:27:42,334
I'm not good with people.


482
0:27:42,334 --> 0:27:45,1
Lack of practice.


483
0:27:45,1 --> 0:27:51,2
It's just... he thought he would
never see any of you again.


484
0:27:51,2 --> 0:27:56,2
Life seldom takes us
where we want it to.


485
0:27:56,2 --> 0:27:59,534
Jim...


486
0:27:59,534 --> 0:28:4,367
I understand loneliness.


487
0:28:4,367 --> 0:28:8,667
You shouldn't try
to banish memories.


488
0:28:8,667 --> 0:28:11,634
They're how we live on.


489
0:28:11,634 --> 0:28:15,634
They're all I have of my mother.


490
0:28:15,634 --> 0:28:17,434
Did you know her?


491
0:28:17,434 --> 0:28:20,734
She'd just come on the ship.


492
0:28:20,734 --> 0:28:23,3
I'd seen her once or twice.


493
0:28:23,3 --> 0:28:26,2
You'd have liked her.


494
0:28:26,2 --> 0:28:29,3
She was funny...


495
0:28:29,3 --> 0:28:31,167
and brave.


496
0:28:31,167 --> 0:28:34,767
I know.


497
0:28:34,767 --> 0:28:36,637
She died saving you.


498
0:28:36,637 --> 0:28:41,634
She didn't hesitate.


499
0:28:41,634 --> 0:28:46,2
I could never be that strong.


500
0:28:46,2 --> 0:28:48,767
Well...


501
0:28:48,767 --> 0:28:52,3
we never know what we can do...


502
0:28:52,3 --> 0:28:58,501
...until we have to.


503
0:28:58,501 --> 0:29:3,1
Captain, if I may...


504
0:29:3,1 --> 0:29:9,634
Excuse me.


505
0:29:9,634 --> 0:29:11,922
Sensor scans of the
external hyperfield


506
0:29:11,922 --> 0:29:15,327
have proven inadequate to risk
a matter-antimatter implosion


507
0:29:15,327 --> 0:29:16,492
to free the ship.


508
0:29:16,492 --> 0:29:17,968
What do you suggest?


509
0:29:17,968 --> 0:29:19,744
The field surrounding
Miss Sulu


510
0:29:19,744 --> 0:29:22,701
seems a benign microcosm
of the larger field.


511
0:29:22,701 --> 0:29:27,567
If I might be allowed to
take some measurements...


512
0:29:27,567 --> 0:29:31,567
Mr. Spock would like
to run some tests on you.


513
0:29:31,567 --> 0:29:32,968
Will it hurt?


514
0:29:32,968 --> 0:29:35,252
No.


515
0:29:35,252 --> 0:29:39,2
I would've said yes anyway.


516
0:29:39,2 --> 0:29:47,2
I'll see you later.


517
0:29:47,2 --> 0:29:49,121
How do we start?


518
0:29:49,121 --> 0:29:56,133
We already have.


519
0:29:56,133 --> 0:29:58,964
One pharmaceutical cocktail
coming up.


520
0:29:58,964 --> 0:30:1,134
I swear, at times like this,


521
0:30:1,134 --> 0:30:6,267
I feel like a bartender,
not a doc--


522
0:30:6,267 --> 0:30:9,33
Sorry, I didn't
mean to, uh...


523
0:30:9,33 --> 0:30:11,367
Oh, it's all right.


524
0:30:11,367 --> 0:30:14,601
The only image
I had of her was...


525
0:30:14,601 --> 0:30:16,501
I understand.


526
0:30:16,501 --> 0:30:21,33
Just lie back.


527
0:30:21,33 --> 0:30:26,0
You'll feel a bit
light-headed and drowsy...


528
0:30:26,0 --> 0:30:29,67
Should I count back
from a hundred?


529
0:30:29,67 --> 0:30:38,234
Just say whatever comes to mind.


530
0:30:38,234 --> 0:30:41,425
To be snatched away
from everything you know,


531
0:30:41,425 --> 0:30:44,801
dropped down
in a wilderness,


532
0:30:44,801 --> 0:30:47,501
have to build your life up
from nothing,


533
0:30:47,501 --> 0:30:53,133
with your bare hands...


534
0:30:53,133 --> 0:31:0,667
...only one thing will let you
do that and survive.


535
0:31:0,667 --> 0:31:2,53
Before all that,


536
0:31:2,53 --> 0:31:7,667
I was on the career track
to captain.


537
0:31:7,667 --> 0:31:11,67
Friends were for off-hours...


538
0:31:11,67 --> 0:31:16,534
hobbies mere diversion.


539
0:31:16,534 --> 0:31:18,734
Family?


540
0:31:18,734 --> 0:31:21,367
Not in the equation.


541
0:31:21,367 --> 0:31:24,634
But then...


542
0:31:24,634 --> 0:31:29,67
through the long nights,


543
0:31:29,67 --> 0:31:32,434
we'd sit in
the crystal towers...


544
0:31:32,434 --> 0:31:38,601
listen to the wind wash
over the dead sea...


545
0:31:38,601 --> 0:31:43,1
gaze up at the twin moons...


546
0:31:43,1 --> 0:31:47,234
share stories we remembered,


547
0:31:47,234 --> 0:31:52,667
adventures we'd had...


548
0:31:52,667 --> 0:32:0,701
I may have been lost...


549
0:32:0,701 --> 0:32:9,1
...but I was home.


550
0:32:9,1 --> 0:32:11,701
It's a rare man
that finds that...


551
0:32:11,701 --> 0:32:16,767
and a lucky one.


552
0:32:16,767 --> 0:32:20,567
Can I ask you a question,
Mr. Spock?


553
0:32:20,567 --> 0:32:22,621
I mean,
if it doesn't distract you.


554
0:32:22,621 --> 0:32:25,184
I'm not easily distracted,
Miss Sulu.


555
0:32:25,184 --> 0:32:27,367
What would you like to know?


556
0:32:27,367 --> 0:32:30,267
Beyond that door...


557
0:32:30,267 --> 0:32:34,701
there are
hundreds of people.


558
0:32:34,701 --> 0:32:39,33
And so far, I've only met six
in my whole life--


559
0:32:39,33 --> 0:32:44,67
four in the last two hours.


560
0:32:44,67 --> 0:32:46,499
My father told me
that you were


561
0:32:46,499 --> 0:32:50,501
the only one
of your kind on the ship.


562
0:32:50,501 --> 0:32:53,734
Do you ever wonder what
people think about you,


563
0:32:53,734 --> 0:32:58,501
or what they see?


564
0:32:58,501 --> 0:33:0,811
They will see precisely
what you are--


565
0:33:0,811 --> 0:33:6,167
a singularly astute and charming
young woman.


566
0:33:6,167 --> 0:33:7,798
But I'm so different.


567
0:33:7,798 --> 0:33:10,4
We are, each of us, unique.


568
0:33:10,4 --> 0:33:14,356
You must admit, some of us are
a lot more unique than others.


569
0:33:14,356 --> 0:33:17,39
It is grammatically incorrect


570
0:33:17,39 --> 0:33:21,3
to place a modifier
before "unique."


571
0:33:21,3 --> 0:33:24,372
But nonetheless,
you are correct.


572
0:33:24,372 --> 0:33:26,968
Some of us are.


573
0:33:26,968 --> 0:33:33,0
You still haven't answered
my question.


574
0:33:33,0 --> 0:33:35,917
I endure the pressures my choice
of life demands,


575
0:33:35,917 --> 0:33:39,3
because I prefer it
to one of solitude...


576
0:33:39,3 --> 0:33:43,435
...and because I have found
that I can tolerate being judged


577
0:33:43,435 --> 0:33:47,133
far better than being
of no consequence.


578
0:33:47,133 --> 0:33:49,227
The scan is complete.


579
0:33:49,227 --> 0:33:53,33
I must get this data
to Mr. Scott.


580
0:33:53,33 --> 0:33:56,968
So, am I one of a kind,
Mr. Spock?


581
0:33:56,968 --> 0:34:5,434
You are indeed, Miss Sulu.


582
0:34:5,434 --> 0:34:7,289
Kirk to sickbay.


583
0:34:7,289 --> 0:34:9,667
How're we doing, Bones?


584
0:34:9,667 --> 0:34:13,353
Jim, I've tried
every neural meta-mnemonic


585
0:34:13,353 --> 0:34:14,859
in ship's stores on Sulu.


586
0:34:14,859 --> 0:34:16,234
And?


587
0:34:16,234 --> 0:34:20,239
Scattered bits and pieces,
nothing you can use.


588
0:34:20,239 --> 0:34:26,3
And I can't give him any more;
his system can't take it.


589
0:34:26,3 --> 0:34:36,267
I'm sorry, Jim.


590
0:34:36,267 --> 0:34:38,376
How goes Plan B, Mr. Spock?


591
0:34:38,376 --> 0:34:40,249
The readings I took
from Miss Sulu


592
0:34:40,249 --> 0:34:42,411
should allow us to
attempt the negation burst.


593
0:34:42,411 --> 0:34:44,725
As soon as Mr. Scott
concludes his adjustments,


594
0:34:44,725 --> 0:34:49,367
we can proceed.


595
0:34:49,367 --> 0:34:53,2
Then I suggest you do so
with all dispatch.


596
0:34:53,2 --> 0:34:55,234
What's wrong?


597
0:34:55,234 --> 0:34:59,13
Jim... Alana Sulu's
atomic structure


598
0:34:59,13 --> 0:35:0,399
is bound to
the hyperfield.


599
0:35:0,399 --> 0:35:3,615
We can't be certain she'll
be coming with us.


600
0:35:3,615 --> 0:35:6,535
Scotty said he'd be able
to bring her over in time.


601
0:35:6,535 --> 0:35:9,144
Time is a luxury
we do not have, Captain,


602
0:35:9,144 --> 0:35:12,344
and we may not have sufficient
power for such an attempt.


603
0:35:12,344 --> 0:35:14,77
Are you sure about this?


604
0:35:14,77 --> 0:35:16,484
There are some variables
in the readings.


605
0:35:16,484 --> 0:35:19,84
The stronger possibility is that
she will remain with the ship.


606
0:35:19,84 --> 0:35:22,767
Still...


607
0:35:22,767 --> 0:35:24,685
Thank you, Mr. Spock.


608
0:35:24,685 --> 0:35:28,506
Should we inform Miss Sulu,
or her father?


609
0:35:28,506 --> 0:35:31,6
No... not yet.


610
0:35:31,6 --> 0:35:34,363
But I expect you to do whatever
you can to better her odds.


611
0:35:34,363 --> 0:35:35,279
Of course.


612
0:35:35,279 --> 0:35:36,357
For now...


613
0:35:36,357 --> 0:35:44,634
is there anything we can do
to make her more comfortable?


614
0:35:44,634 --> 0:35:47,767
Are you still hanging around?


615
0:35:47,767 --> 0:35:50,254
Don't you have
anything better to do


616
0:35:50,254 --> 0:35:51,592
than make fun of easy targets?


617
0:35:51,592 --> 0:35:54,12
Well, we had a few moments
before the implosion attempt.


618
0:35:54,12 --> 0:35:56,413
I thought I'd drop by
and give you a surprise.


619
0:35:56,413 --> 0:35:57,976
A surprise?


620
0:35:57,976 --> 0:36:2,956
Mr. Scott had some bored
technicians he needed to occupy.


621
0:36:2,956 --> 0:36:27,677
Would you care for a stroll?


622
0:36:27,677 --> 0:36:28,871
What do you call this?


623
0:36:28,871 --> 0:36:31,692
Deck 12-- it's not
very imaginative.


624
0:36:31,692 --> 0:36:46,639
It's perfect.


625
0:36:46,639 --> 0:36:49,46
This.


626
0:36:49,46 --> 0:36:51,536
What?


627
0:36:51,536 --> 0:36:56,434
The best moment of my life.


628
0:36:56,434 --> 0:37:1,85
Few people recognize it
while it's happening.


629
0:37:1,85 --> 0:37:4,84
All the better reason
to notice it.


630
0:37:4,84 --> 0:37:16,518
It's just the first of many.


631
0:37:16,518 --> 0:37:22,167
It's a good look for you.


632
0:37:22,167 --> 0:37:26,963
Uhura...


633
0:37:26,963 --> 0:37:30,545
It's been forever.


634
0:37:30,545 --> 0:37:32,76
My God...


635
0:37:32,76 --> 0:37:35,61
What?


636
0:37:35,61 --> 0:37:39,185
You're younger
than my daughter.


637
0:37:39,185 --> 0:37:41,605
Yeah, I heard about her.


638
0:37:41,605 --> 0:37:44,494
She sounds wonderful.


639
0:37:44,494 --> 0:37:49,0
She takes after her mother.


640
0:37:49,0 --> 0:37:54,3
Uhura to the bridge.


641
0:37:54,3 --> 0:38:6,33
Acknowledged.


642
0:38:6,33 --> 0:38:13,262
We'll catch up
later, okay?


643
0:38:13,262 --> 0:38:15,954
Uhura.


644
0:38:15,954 --> 0:38:30,98
Don't let it all go by.


645
0:38:30,98 --> 0:38:31,475
If you've got
your sea legs back,


646
0:38:31,475 --> 0:38:33,964
you're free to go.


647
0:38:33,964 --> 0:38:43,35
Thank you, Doctor.


648
0:38:43,35 --> 0:38:48,0
Those aren't really necessary.


649
0:38:48,0 --> 0:39:16,167
I know.


650
0:39:16,167 --> 0:39:18,4
Bridge.


651
0:39:18,4 --> 0:39:21,401
It's a turbolift.


652
0:39:21,401 --> 0:39:23,446
It moves horizontally and
vertically throughout the ship.


653
0:39:23,446 --> 0:39:28,234
You command miracles
and you don't even know it.


654
0:39:28,234 --> 0:39:35,434
I'm starting to.


655
0:39:35,434 --> 0:39:40,99
Alana!


656
0:39:40,99 --> 0:39:42,66
Alana!


657
0:39:42,66 --> 0:39:44,501
We had nothing like this
on Caliban.


658
0:39:44,501 --> 0:39:47,52
The name your parents
gave that planet--


659
0:39:47,52 --> 0:39:49,64
do you know where it's from?


660
0:39:49,64 --> 0:39:51,8
My mother was in a production
of The Tempest


661
0:39:51,8 --> 0:39:53,139
when she was a girl.


662
0:39:53,139 --> 0:39:53,979
She knew it by heart.


663
0:39:53,979 --> 0:39:56,781
The sorcerer
and his beautiful daughter,


664
0:39:56,781 --> 0:39:59,608
marooned on an island
until a ship arrives.


665
0:39:59,608 --> 0:40:2,135
"A brave vessel,
who had no doubt


666
0:40:2,135 --> 0:40:5,1
some noble creatures in her..."


667
0:40:5,1 --> 0:40:7,67
We'd perform it over and over.


668
0:40:7,67 --> 0:40:9,667
With Sulu as Prospero...


669
0:40:9,667 --> 0:40:11,983
and you as Miranda?


670
0:40:11,983 --> 0:40:17,176
I preferred Ariel...
who could fly.


671
0:40:17,176 --> 0:40:19,643
And where would you
like to go, Ariel?


672
0:40:19,643 --> 0:40:32,0
Where would you take me, Jim?


673
0:40:32,0 --> 0:40:32,659
Yes?


674
0:40:32,659 --> 0:40:36,693
We're ready to initiate
the implosion, Captain.


675
0:40:36,693 --> 0:40:38,394
I'll be there momentarily.


676
0:40:38,394 --> 0:40:40,338
Kirk out.


677
0:40:40,338 --> 0:40:45,567
Another miracle required?


678
0:40:45,567 --> 0:40:49,226
I'm afraid you'll have to return
to the stasis room, for safety.


679
0:40:49,226 --> 0:40:51,608
This device will
beam you there.


680
0:40:51,608 --> 0:40:53,579
Oh...


681
0:40:53,579 --> 0:40:59,937
You'll see the bridge soon,
I promise.


682
0:40:59,937 --> 0:41:15,972
I'll hold you to that.


683
0:41:15,972 --> 0:41:17,721
Where were you?


684
0:41:17,721 --> 0:41:20,389
Jim arranged a tour.


685
0:41:20,389 --> 0:41:23,33
"Jim"?


686
0:41:23,33 --> 0:41:30,564
Are you jealous, Father?


687
0:41:30,564 --> 0:41:33,372
Status, Mr. Spock.


688
0:41:33,372 --> 0:41:36,912
Ready when you are, Captain.


689
0:41:36,912 --> 0:41:38,542
This might be one
of those rare times


690
0:41:38,542 --> 0:41:40,299
when we actually get
out of a tight spot


691
0:41:40,299 --> 0:41:42,2
with some breathing room.


692
0:41:42,2 --> 0:41:46,216
All decks,
this is the captain speaking.


693
0:41:46,216 --> 0:41:48,943
We're about to emit a
plasma-antiplasma burst,


694
0:41:48,943 --> 0:41:50,277
in an attempt to free the ship.


695
0:41:50,277 --> 0:41:54,132
Brace yourselves.


696
0:41:54,132 --> 0:41:55,766
At your discretion, Mr. DeSalle.


697
0:41:55,766 --> 0:41:56,866
Aye, sir.


698
0:41:56,866 --> 0:41:59,232
Detonation in
five... four...


699
0:41:59,232 --> 0:42:1,92
three... two...


700
0:42:1,92 --> 0:42:15,523
one.


701
0:42:15,523 --> 0:42:21,47
Alana!


702
0:42:21,47 --> 0:42:22,78
Spock! What's happening?


703
0:42:22,78 --> 0:42:31,222
Unknown, Captain.


704
0:42:31,222 --> 0:42:33,769
Computer, analysis
of implosion result.


705
0:42:33,769 --> 0:42:35,402
Working.


706
0:42:35,402 --> 0:42:37,817
Analysis indicates
temporal discontinuity


707
0:42:37,817 --> 0:42:39,267
caused by implosion.


708
0:42:39,267 --> 0:42:42,65
My calculations predicted
this possibility,


709
0:42:42,65 --> 0:42:44,265
but not at this magnitude.


710
0:42:44,265 --> 0:42:46,306
Just tell us what
it means, Spock.


711
0:42:46,306 --> 0:42:48,621
It means, Doctor,
that we are still trapped,


712
0:42:48,621 --> 0:42:51,838
but instead of hours,
we now have only 32 minutes


713
0:42:51,838 --> 0:42:57,26
before our shields collapse.


714
0:42:57,26 --> 0:43:6,559
Sulu to McCoy! Emergency!


715
0:43:6,559 --> 0:43:8,44
Captain's log, supplemental.


716
0:43:8,44 --> 0:43:11,388
With drug therapy no longer
an option to jog Sulu's memory,


717
0:43:11,388 --> 0:43:13,177
and our time
drastically reduced


718
0:43:13,177 --> 0:43:14,176
by the implosion attempt,


719
0:43:14,176 --> 0:43:16,123
our options are closing
about us--


720
0:43:16,123 --> 0:43:27,548
just as the field is closing
about the Enterprise.


721
0:43:27,548 --> 0:43:29,4
It's nothing, really.


722
0:43:29,4 --> 0:43:33,567
I was just dizzy for a moment.


723
0:43:33,567 --> 0:43:35,0
She's all right now,


724
0:43:35,0 --> 0:43:39,533
near as I can determine.


725
0:43:39,533 --> 0:43:41,424
Miss Sulu's
molecular structure


726
0:43:41,424 --> 0:43:44,0
is indeed linked to the
exterior hyperfield.


727
0:43:44,0 --> 0:43:46,803
If we fail to find a way
to fully extricate her


728
0:43:46,803 --> 0:43:48,611
before risking another
implosion attempt...


729
0:43:48,611 --> 0:43:50,668
Another implosion's
not an option.


730
0:43:50,668 --> 0:43:52,516
And without the
navigational coordinates...


731
0:43:52,516 --> 0:43:54,24
Gentlemen, I suggest


732
0:43:54,24 --> 0:43:55,496
you come up with
something original,


733
0:43:55,496 --> 0:43:57,665
because we're not going
to just count down the minutes


734
0:43:57,665 --> 0:43:59,33
until this ship
is destroyed.


735
0:43:59,33 --> 0:44:0,467
Captain,


736
0:44:0,467 --> 0:44:4,2
if Mr. Scott can lock in
on the coordinates of Caliban,


737
0:44:4,2 --> 0:44:7,609
it might be feasible to beam
the entire ship's company there.


738
0:44:7,609 --> 0:44:9,83
It wouldn't help the ship, but...


739
0:44:9,83 --> 0:44:11,702
It would save the crew.


740
0:44:11,702 --> 0:44:15,467
We'd be marooned there.


741
0:44:15,467 --> 0:44:17,105
But alive.


742
0:44:17,105 --> 0:44:20,158
And all in all,
it's not that bad a life.


743
0:44:20,158 --> 0:44:21,976
But if we lower the shields...


744
0:44:21,976 --> 0:44:24,109
That might not
be necessary,


745
0:44:24,109 --> 0:44:27,27
given the higher
dimensions involved.


746
0:44:27,27 --> 0:44:28,12
Mr. Scott.


747
0:44:28,12 --> 0:44:31,4
Aye, Captain.


748
0:44:31,4 --> 0:44:35,209
Dr. McCoy, if I may examine
the data on your tricorder...


749
0:44:35,209 --> 0:44:37,234
Be my guest.


750
0:44:37,234 --> 0:44:39,369
How are you feeling?


751
0:44:39,369 --> 0:44:43,434
Like a fool.


752
0:44:43,434 --> 0:44:57,156
So, tell me, back home, how are
you set up for houseguests?


753
0:44:57,156 --> 0:44:58,251
Kirk here.


754
0:44:58,251 --> 0:45:6,2
Captain, can you get up here?


755
0:45:6,2 --> 0:45:7,956
There's no way to duplicate
the energy wave


756
0:45:7,956 --> 0:45:9,318
that sent Sulu to Caliban.


757
0:45:9,318 --> 0:45:11,56
It was a one-in-a-million
freak accident.


758
0:45:11,56 --> 0:45:13,234
None of us can
beam there?


759
0:45:13,234 --> 0:45:15,3
But I happened
on something else.


760
0:45:15,3 --> 0:45:17,52
Sulu's original
transporter pattern.


761
0:45:17,52 --> 0:45:19,823
The temporal field shift
kept it intact.


762
0:45:19,823 --> 0:45:22,324
Are you saying we might be
able to reintegrate him?


763
0:45:22,324 --> 0:45:23,498
As he was,


764
0:45:23,498 --> 0:45:25,321
when we beamed him off
the bird-of-prey.


765
0:45:25,321 --> 0:45:27,633
It's possible--
theoretically, at least.


766
0:45:27,633 --> 0:45:30,431
25 minutes to shield failure.


767
0:45:30,431 --> 0:45:33,667
Get him up here.


768
0:45:33,667 --> 0:45:36,831
It should be possible to
reverse the aging process


769
0:45:36,831 --> 0:45:39,205
by passing your
current incarnation


770
0:45:39,205 --> 0:45:40,167
through the pattern buffer.


771
0:45:40,167 --> 0:45:43,845
Restoring, in effect,
your last saved state.


772
0:45:43,845 --> 0:45:47,233
Yes, I see.


773
0:45:47,233 --> 0:45:49,2
I don't understand.


774
0:45:49,2 --> 0:45:52,267
You mean you'd be
giving him back 30 years?


775
0:45:52,267 --> 0:45:59,534
No, we'd be
taking them away.


776
0:45:59,534 --> 0:46:2,527
I'd revert to the man
I was


777
0:46:2,527 --> 0:46:7,495
before your mother
and I were transported.


778
0:46:7,495 --> 0:46:9,334
As far as I'd be concerned,


779
0:46:9,334 --> 0:46:17,501
the life we spent there
would never have happened.


780
0:46:17,501 --> 0:46:19,72
But the Romulan
navigational data


781
0:46:19,72 --> 0:46:21,1
will be fresh
in your mind,


782
0:46:21,1 --> 0:46:23,968
and you should be able to use
it to pilot us to safety.


783
0:46:23,968 --> 0:46:28,234
The memories would be gone.


784
0:46:28,234 --> 0:46:30,397
I wouldn't know you.


785
0:46:30,397 --> 0:46:35,701
20 minutes to shield failure.


786
0:46:35,701 --> 0:46:37,968
You can't get rid of me
that easily.


787
0:46:37,968 --> 0:46:39,831
I'd be here to remind you


788
0:46:39,831 --> 0:46:48,935
of every stubborn, mule-headed
thing you ever did.


789
0:46:48,935 --> 0:46:52,208
If it's the only way to...


790
0:46:52,208 --> 0:47:0,488
Captain.


791
0:47:0,488 --> 0:47:2,895
I'm sorry, Jim.


792
0:47:2,895 --> 0:47:6,26
Alana?


793
0:47:6,26 --> 0:47:8,67
I thought the only danger
was the implosion.


794
0:47:8,67 --> 0:47:11,194
I've been reviewing
Dr. McCoy's medical data,


795
0:47:11,194 --> 0:47:13,177
along with both
my own scans


796
0:47:13,177 --> 0:47:18,267
of Miss Sulu
and the exterior hyperfield.


797
0:47:18,267 --> 0:47:21,1
They'd best be getting
a move on.


798
0:47:21,1 --> 0:47:23,468
I've no mind to be trading
my uniform


799
0:47:23,468 --> 0:47:27,3
for a white robe
at this late date.


800
0:47:27,3 --> 0:47:29,496
I checked her
medical readings.


801
0:47:29,496 --> 0:47:32,133
There's no doubt, Jim.


802
0:47:32,133 --> 0:47:38,1
Do we tell her?


803
0:47:38,1 --> 0:47:48,67
We tell them both.


804
0:47:48,67 --> 0:47:50,282
Captain, what is it?


805
0:47:50,282 --> 0:47:53,248
Your atoms,
your molecules,


806
0:47:53,248 --> 0:47:54,767
everything that is you--


807
0:47:54,767 --> 0:47:56,631
is still tied to Caliban
through the hyperfield.


808
0:47:56,631 --> 0:48:1,33
It's why you blacked out.


809
0:48:1,33 --> 0:48:4,467
And should we succeed
shortly in freeing ourselves,


810
0:48:4,467 --> 0:48:6,761
the interference caused
by our warp engines


811
0:48:6,761 --> 0:48:10,67
will result in the field
collapsing...


812
0:48:10,67 --> 0:48:16,133
...destroying everything
still linked to it.


813
0:48:16,133 --> 0:48:21,59
My God, do you know
what you're saying?!


814
0:48:21,59 --> 0:48:23,51
Yes.


815
0:48:23,51 --> 0:48:26,574
You've got to beam her fully
onto the Enterprise!


816
0:48:26,574 --> 0:48:28,135
Now!


817
0:48:28,135 --> 0:48:31,0
Not possible.


818
0:48:31,0 --> 0:48:39,501
She is one with the universe
that spawned her.


819
0:48:39,501 --> 0:48:44,401
Then, can you beam me back?


820
0:48:44,401 --> 0:48:47,133
No.


821
0:48:47,133 --> 0:48:50,2
But were the ship to fail
to extricate itself,


822
0:48:50,2 --> 0:48:53,208
there is a 92.3% probability


823
0:48:53,208 --> 0:48:54,634
the field would survive,


824
0:48:54,634 --> 0:48:57,767
and you would be returned
to Caliban.


825
0:48:57,767 --> 0:48:59,601
She could live.


826
0:48:59,601 --> 0:49:7,567
But 430 others will die.


827
0:49:7,567 --> 0:49:13,51
There has to be another way.


828
0:49:13,51 --> 0:49:17,734
I can't tell you what to do.


829
0:49:17,734 --> 0:49:20,583
But you alone know
the navigational coordinates,


830
0:49:20,583 --> 0:49:28,1
and have the piloting skill
necessary to save the ship.


831
0:49:28,1 --> 0:49:32,734
I don't care who dies--
she lives!


832
0:49:32,734 --> 0:49:35,541
Not this time, Mr. Spock.


833
0:49:35,541 --> 0:49:37,233
Father...


834
0:49:37,233 --> 0:49:41,2
I can't let you do this.


835
0:49:41,2 --> 0:49:43,243
Alana...


836
0:49:43,243 --> 0:49:46,534
Even if Mr. Spock is right,
and I survive--


837
0:49:46,534 --> 0:49:53,601
what kind of life would that be?


838
0:49:53,601 --> 0:49:58,3
How can I go back
to that empty world...


839
0:49:58,3 --> 0:50:2,2
How can I live,
knowing that you,


840
0:50:2,2 --> 0:50:11,1
or that all of you,
died because of me?


841
0:50:11,1 --> 0:50:15,822
I don't know
if there's an afterlife,


842
0:50:15,822 --> 0:50:19,834
I don't know where
we go when we die...


843
0:50:19,834 --> 0:50:24,167
...but if, Father...


844
0:50:24,167 --> 0:50:29,133
...it's not how long we live,


845
0:50:29,133 --> 0:50:34,801
it's how we live that matters...


846
0:50:34,801 --> 0:50:54,655
...let my life mean something.


847
0:50:54,655 --> 0:51:3,338
Do it, damn you!


848
0:51:3,338 --> 0:51:10,2
Energize.


849
0:51:10,2 --> 0:51:17,247
"Our revels... now are ended.


850
0:51:17,247 --> 0:51:20,381
"And these our actors,


851
0:51:20,381 --> 0:51:22,634
"as I foretold you,


852
0:51:22,634 --> 0:51:27,68
"were all spirits...


853
0:51:27,68 --> 0:51:31,834
"that are melted into air...


854
0:51:31,834 --> 0:51:38,701
"into thin air...


855
0:51:38,701 --> 0:51:44,4
We are such stuff..."


856
0:51:44,4 --> 0:52:21,434
"As dreams are made on..."


857
0:52:21,434 --> 0:52:27,167
Ten minutes to shield failure.


858
0:52:27,167 --> 0:52:29,251
He's in massive shock.


859
0:52:29,251 --> 0:52:30,327
We need him on the bridge.


860
0:52:30,327 --> 0:52:31,372
What can you give him?


861
0:52:31,372 --> 0:52:33,45
Two cc's of
cordrazine.


862
0:52:33,45 --> 0:52:35,346
Any more will kill him.


863
0:52:35,346 --> 0:52:42,139
Get him to his
station-- fast.


864
0:52:42,139 --> 0:52:45,684
Jim.


865
0:52:45,684 --> 0:52:57,4
In a minute.


866
0:52:57,4 --> 0:53:1,454
My father told me
you were impressive.


867
0:53:1,454 --> 0:53:3,458
Alana, I...


868
0:53:3,458 --> 0:53:6,801
Your ship needs you.


869
0:53:6,801 --> 0:53:17,734
Is there anything
that you'd like?


870
0:53:17,734 --> 0:53:28,834
Two minutes to shield failure.


871
0:53:28,834 --> 0:53:36,139
How young he is.


872
0:53:36,139 --> 0:53:41,296
How handsome.


873
0:53:41,296 --> 0:53:51,977
Hyperdimensional
coordinates entered.


874
0:53:51,977 --> 0:53:56,267
Artificial gravity compromised.


875
0:53:56,267 --> 0:54:0,567
Life support system's
on reserve power.


876
0:54:0,567 --> 0:54:6,24
Acknowledged.


877
0:54:6,24 --> 0:54:43,2
One minute to shield failure.


878
0:54:43,2 --> 0:54:46,115
Ten seconds to shield failure.


879
0:54:46,115 --> 0:54:47,334
Nine...


880
0:54:47,334 --> 0:54:48,834
Eight...


881
0:54:48,834 --> 0:54:50,31
Seven...


882
0:54:50,31 --> 0:54:51,613
Six...


883
0:54:51,613 --> 0:55:13,173
Warp drive engaged. Hold on!


884
0:55:13,173 --> 0:55:28,743
We're free!


885
0:55:28,743 --> 0:55:40,433
Free.


886
0:55:40,433 --> 0:55:47,67
As you were.


887
0:55:47,67 --> 0:55:49,733
How are you feeling?


888
0:55:49,733 --> 0:55:53,9
A little rough around the edges.


889
0:55:53,9 --> 0:55:56,367
Captain...


890
0:55:56,367 --> 0:55:59,7
I'm told I attacked you,


891
0:55:59,7 --> 0:56:3,67
tried to harm you.


892
0:56:3,67 --> 0:56:15,9
There were extenuating
circumstances.


893
0:56:15,9 --> 0:56:21,401
I've watched this.


894
0:56:21,401 --> 0:56:25,833
It's like it's happening
to another person.


895
0:56:25,833 --> 0:56:29,767
Alana...


896
0:56:29,767 --> 0:56:32,7
My daughter.


897
0:56:32,7 --> 0:56:37,67
The life I had...


898
0:56:37,67 --> 0:56:41,401
There's nothing.


899
0:56:41,401 --> 0:56:46,401
I'm sorry for your loss.


900
0:56:46,401 --> 0:56:51,267
Did you get to know her?


901
0:56:51,267 --> 0:56:54,401
Yes.


902
0:56:54,401 --> 0:56:58,67
She was...


903
0:56:58,67 --> 0:57:3,7
She was unique.


904
0:57:3,7 --> 0:57:7,301
She lived her life fully
in the time she had...


905
0:57:7,301 --> 0:57:12,767
and gave it up for love.


906
0:57:12,767 --> 0:57:16,367
What better epitaph...


907
0:57:16,367 --> 0:57:25,367
could anyone ask for?


908
0:57:25,367 --> 0:57:29,767
Oh, God.


909
0:57:29,767 --> 0:57:32,767
If I could only remember.


910
0:57:32,767 --> 0:57:34,539
Mr. Sulu,


911
0:57:34,539 --> 0:57:38,523
when I attempted to extricate
the data from your mind,


912
0:57:38,523 --> 0:57:40,938
when our thoughts were joined...


913
0:57:40,938 --> 0:57:45,1
I lived those years with you.


914
0:57:45,1 --> 0:57:48,34
What are you saying?


915
0:57:48,34 --> 0:57:51,367
They can be yours again.


916
0:57:51,367 --> 0:57:53,256
But with the memories...


917
0:57:53,256 --> 0:58:6,727
would come the grief.


918
0:58:6,727 --> 0:58:22,7
Very well.


919
0:58:22,7 --> 0:58:34,301
Alana?


920
0:58:34,301 --> 0:58:36,0
Alana...


921
0:58:36,0 --> 0:58:38,767
Captain?


922
0:58:38,767 --> 0:58:40,234
Captain Sulu?


923
0:58:40,234 --> 0:58:42,393
Yes, Ensign?


924
0:58:42,393 --> 0:58:45,37
Your guests have disembarked
from the shuttle, Captain.


925
0:58:45,37 --> 0:58:48,257
Escort them to my ready room.


926
0:58:48,257 --> 0:58:49,938
Aye, sir.


927
0:58:49,938 --> 0:58:52,888
Rand, you have the Conn.


928
0:58:52,888 --> 0:58:55,733
Aye, Captain.


929
0:58:55,733 --> 0:58:57,17
Captain?


930
0:58:57,17 --> 0:58:59,414
Yes?


931
0:58:59,414 --> 0:59:16,61
You're a very lucky man.


932
0:59:16,61 --> 0:59:22,234
"We are such stuff
as dreams are made on..."


933
0:59:22,234 --> 0:59:29,401
"And our little life
is rounded with a sleep..."


934
0:59:29,401 --> 0:59:32,367
Talking to
yourself, Father?


935
0:59:32,367 --> 0:59:36,234
I'd better keep
a closer eye on you.


936
0:59:36,234 --> 0:59:39,767
Demora.


937
0:59:39,767 --> 0:59:52,134
Say hello to your granddaughter.


938
0:59:52,134 --> 0:59:58,367
So beautiful.


939
0:59:58,367 --> 1:0:4,34
The whole universe
is ahead of you.


940
1:0:4,34 --> 1:0:6,343
And I did as you asked--


941
1:0:6,343 --> 1:0:9,301
with her name.


942
1:0:9,301 --> 1:0:14,833
But... I don't understand.


943
1:0:14,833 --> 1:0:21,167
Who's Alana?


944
1:0:21,167 --> 1:0:52,904
You had a sister.
