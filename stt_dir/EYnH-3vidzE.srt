1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:12,32



2
0:0:12,32 --> 0:0:14,4
SHANE SMITH: It turned out to
be a comparatively short


3
0:0:14,4 --> 0:0:17,42
10-hour train ride from Tynda to
Dipkun, which was the next


4
0:0:17,42 --> 0:0:21,28
town that had a North
Korean camp in it.


5
0:0:21,28 --> 0:0:23,66
When we finally got there, it
was pretty late in the day.


6
0:0:23,66 --> 0:0:24,97
We had to move fast.


7
0:0:24,97 --> 0:0:27,7
If we were going to see the
North Korean camp and get back


8
0:0:27,7 --> 0:0:30,12
in time before the pitch black
Siberian night fell and


9
0:0:30,12 --> 0:0:32,44
stranded us in the forest.


10
0:0:32,44 --> 0:0:35,45
Well, we're sort of in the
middle of nowhere.


11
0:0:35,45 --> 0:0:37,46
But we're going to try to
go to the camp now.


12
0:0:37,46 --> 0:0:40,17



13
0:0:40,17 --> 0:0:42,58
The old chief of police of
Dipkun, who we met on the


14
0:0:42,58 --> 0:0:45,44
train, had offered to take us
out there in his new truck but


15
0:0:45,44 --> 0:0:47,92
was a bit worried about the
bridge because it had recently


16
0:0:47,92 --> 0:0:49,64
been washed out.


17
0:0:49,64 --> 0:0:50,51
We could take this.


18
0:0:50,51 --> 0:0:52,242
This would be awesome.


19
0:0:52,242 --> 0:0:53,492
Is this us?


20
0:0:53,492 --> 0:0:56,1



21
0:0:56,1 --> 0:0:59,66
So we are in a race against
time to go see the North


22
0:0:59,66 --> 0:1:0,61
Korean camp.


23
0:1:0,61 --> 0:1:3,68
The old chief of police
is driving us.


24
0:1:3,68 --> 0:1:7,15



25
0:1:7,15 --> 0:1:9,67
He'd been the chief of police
for over a decade and


26
0:1:9,67 --> 0:1:11,0
consequently knew
the North Korean


27
0:1:11,0 --> 0:1:12,36
situation there quite well.


28
0:1:12,36 --> 0:1:13,61
RODION MIKHAILOV:
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]


29
0:1:13,61 --> 0:1:16,53



30
0:1:16,53 --> 0:1:17,265
SIMON OSTROVSKY: They
get kopecks.


31
0:1:17,265 --> 0:1:18,704
RODION MIKHAILOV:
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]


32
0:1:18,704 --> 0:1:19,598
SHANE SMITH: What's kopeck?


33
0:1:19,598 --> 0:1:20,45
SIMON OSTROVSKY: Pennies.


34
0:1:20,45 --> 0:1:21,386
RODION MIKHAILOV:
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]


35
0:1:21,386 --> 0:1:25,48



36
0:1:25,48 --> 0:1:27,33
SIMON OSTROVSKY: They live
in smelly barracks--


37
0:1:27,33 --> 0:1:29,315
like dozens of people
all together.


38
0:1:29,315 --> 0:1:30,614
RODION MIKHAILOV:
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]


39
0:1:30,614 --> 0:1:38,406



40
0:1:38,406 --> 0:1:40,354
SIMON OSTROVSKY: Yeah, I think
we're getting there.


41
0:1:40,354 --> 0:1:43,29



42
0:1:43,29 --> 0:1:48,16
SHANE SMITH: The bridges is made
out of old railway ties.


43
0:1:48,16 --> 0:1:51,34
Our buddy, the chief of police,
he buys this truck on


44
0:1:51,34 --> 0:1:54,39
credit and then fucking risks
the whole thing by driving


45
0:1:54,39 --> 0:1:57,19
across this fucking thing, which
he doesn't even know who


46
0:1:57,19 --> 0:1:58,36
built it or when.


47
0:1:58,36 --> 0:1:59,61
SIMON OSTROVSKY: Maybe we should
have taken our stuff


48
0:1:59,61 --> 0:2:2,2
off in case he falls
into the river.


49
0:2:2,2 --> 0:2:3,63
SHANE SMITH: He's got
balls, this guy.


50
0:2:3,63 --> 0:2:4,65
SIMON OSTROVSKY: Yeah.


51
0:2:4,65 --> 0:2:6,97
SHANE SMITH: We'll have to
buy him some more vodka.


52
0:2:6,97 --> 0:2:8,22
Hey.


53
0:2:8,22 --> 0:2:16,67



54
0:2:16,67 --> 0:2:20,268
SIMON OSTROVSKY: Oh my god, it's
completely been cleared.


55
0:2:20,268 --> 0:2:21,51
RODION MIKHAILOV:
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]


56
0:2:21,51 --> 0:2:23,86
SHANE SMITH: So this is our
chief of police, and he's


57
0:2:23,86 --> 0:2:26,7
breaking in to the North
Korean camp.


58
0:2:26,7 --> 0:2:29,996
I love him.


59
0:2:29,996 --> 0:2:31,96
RODION MIKHAILOV:
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]


60
0:2:31,96 --> 0:2:33,433
SHANE SMITH: [LAUGH]


61
0:2:33,433 --> 0:2:37,38
I love this guy so much.


62
0:2:37,38 --> 0:2:40,18
This was a whole
Korean village.


63
0:2:40,18 --> 0:2:42,9
SIMON OSTROVSKY: They had a
sign here that said, "Kim


64
0:2:42,9 --> 0:2:44,5
Il-Sung lives with
us forever."


65
0:2:44,5 --> 0:2:46,69
SHANE SMITH: Because, I guess,
that there have been some


66
0:2:46,69 --> 0:2:48,39
people who came--


67
0:2:48,39 --> 0:2:50,56
Simon, who's with us,
being one of them--


68
0:2:50,56 --> 0:2:51,97
they've knocked down the camp.


69
0:2:51,97 --> 0:2:53,53
And they've moved on
to the next village


70
0:2:53,53 --> 0:2:55,85
down the train line.


71
0:2:55,85 --> 0:2:58,18
SIMON OSTROVSKY: This used to
have a slogan on it that said,


72
0:2:58,18 --> 0:3:1,63
"laboratory of Kim Il-Sung's
theory." So they've given it


73
0:3:1,63 --> 0:3:3,9
over to an entrepreneur
to take down.


74
0:3:3,9 --> 0:3:6,94
And then his benefit is he gets
to sell the spare parts


75
0:3:6,94 --> 0:3:8,97
and metal and stuff like that.


76
0:3:8,97 --> 0:3:10,49
Let's try to open the door.


77
0:3:10,49 --> 0:3:12,62
SHANE SMITH: This was built by
the North Koreans to resemble


78
0:3:12,62 --> 0:3:13,27
North Korea.


79
0:3:13,27 --> 0:3:15,76
They wanted it to be like
a home away from home.


80
0:3:15,76 --> 0:3:19,17
And this was the laboratory
of Kim Il-Sung's theory.


81
0:3:19,17 --> 0:3:20,595
So we're going to
go check it out.


82
0:3:20,595 --> 0:3:28,21



83
0:3:28,21 --> 0:3:31,41
So this is where they would
learn about Juche, the ideals


84
0:3:31,41 --> 0:3:32,84
of Kim Il-Sung.


85
0:3:32,84 --> 0:3:34,9
The study room was a bit freaky
because it had the


86
0:3:34,9 --> 0:3:37,65
requisite painting of Mount
Baekdu, which I had seen a lot


87
0:3:37,65 --> 0:3:40,17
when I was in North Korea, which
was where Kim Jong-Il


88
0:3:40,17 --> 0:3:42,96
was supposed to have been born
under a double rainbow as a


89
0:3:42,96 --> 0:3:45,99
new star shot into the sky
to mark the joyous event.


90
0:3:45,99 --> 0:3:48,91
But in actual fact, he was
really born in a small log


91
0:3:48,91 --> 0:3:52,18
cabin near Khabarovsk, where
we had started our journey,


92
0:3:52,18 --> 0:3:55,1
while the Soviets trained his
dad to be the Stalinist,


93
0:3:55,1 --> 0:3:59,75
cult-of-personality leader of
Korea after World War II.


94
0:3:59,75 --> 0:4:4,77
So there's a room here filled
with Juche ideals.


95
0:4:4,77 --> 0:4:7,83
You kind of feel like you've
stumbled on a cult house


96
0:4:7,83 --> 0:4:11,85
because there's these weird
things to make candles, and


97
0:4:11,85 --> 0:4:16,64
fires, and homage to the Juche
ideals and we're finding crazy


98
0:4:16,64 --> 0:4:20,31
propaganda stuff because North
Korea's a cult of personality.


99
0:4:20,31 --> 0:4:22,755
One man runs, like a
god, the country.


100
0:4:22,755 --> 0:4:25,48



101
0:4:25,48 --> 0:4:27,38
SIMON OSTROVSKY: It's kind of
got this eerie, Pompeii


102
0:4:27,38 --> 0:4:28,73
feeling about it.


103
0:4:28,73 --> 0:4:31,12
SHANE SMITH: It's such a bizarre
concept that there's


104
0:4:31,12 --> 0:4:34,14
little North Koreas dotted
around Siberia.


105
0:4:34,14 --> 0:4:35,55
SIMON OSTROVSKY: This would
have been living quarters


106
0:4:35,55 --> 0:4:36,48
right here.


107
0:4:36,48 --> 0:4:37,77
SHANE SMITH: It's
not very nice.


108
0:4:37,77 --> 0:4:38,89
SIMON OSTROVSKY: Pure filth.


109
0:4:38,89 --> 0:4:40,14
SHANE SMITH: Very disgusting.


110
0:4:40,14 --> 0:4:42,2



111
0:4:42,2 --> 0:4:43,27
SIMON OSTROVSKY: There's
one of the old dudes.


112
0:4:43,27 --> 0:4:46,0



113
0:4:46,0 --> 0:4:46,8
SHANE SMITH: Oh shit.


114
0:4:46,8 --> 0:4:47,16
Oh that's--


115
0:4:47,16 --> 0:4:48,21
RODION MIKHAILOV:
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]


116
0:4:48,21 --> 0:4:49,122
SIMON OSTROVSKY: He
says it's fine.


117
0:4:49,122 --> 0:4:50,46
SHANE SMITH: Are they
North Koreans?


118
0:4:50,46 --> 0:4:52,47
SIMON OSTROVSKY: No, but it'd
to be cool if we were, and


119
0:4:52,47 --> 0:4:54,21
they saw us looting.


120
0:4:54,21 --> 0:4:55,78
SHANE SMITH: We're literally
getting caught in


121
0:4:55,78 --> 0:4:57,14
looting right now.


122
0:4:57,14 --> 0:4:58,13
All smiles.


123
0:4:58,13 --> 0:4:58,34
SIMON OSTROVSKY: Just smile.


124
0:4:58,34 --> 0:5:0,25
They'll think you're crazy.


125
0:5:0,25 --> 0:5:1,5
RODION MIKHAILOV:
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]


126
0:5:1,5 --> 0:5:6,204



127
0:5:6,204 --> 0:5:8,16
SIMON OSTROVSKY: He says, you
want to see a real Korean?


128
0:5:8,16 --> 0:5:9,5
SHANE SMITH: Yeah.


129
0:5:9,5 --> 0:5:10,1
We should get the vodka.


130
0:5:10,1 --> 0:5:13,56
SIMON OSTROVSKY:
[SPEAKING RUSSIAN]


131
0:5:13,56 --> 0:5:16,95
SHANE SMITH:
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]


132
0:5:16,95 --> 0:5:18,215
Hello.


133
0:5:18,215 --> 0:5:20,26
SIMON OSTROVSKY: Simon.


134
0:5:20,26 --> 0:5:21,91
We have to cross the bridge
while it's light.


135
0:5:21,91 --> 0:5:24,85
SHANE SMITH: Oh, OK.


136
0:5:24,85 --> 0:5:26,308
KIM ZUNG YUN:
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]


137
0:5:26,308 --> 0:5:27,766
LABORER:
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]


138
0:5:27,766 --> 0:5:29,224
KIM ZUNG YUN:
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]


139
0:5:29,224 --> 0:5:33,598



140
0:5:33,598 --> 0:5:37,49
LABORER:
[SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]


141
0:5:37,49 --> 0:5:38,92
SHANE SMITH: Well, I feel bad
for the guy because he's


142
0:5:38,92 --> 0:5:39,78
obviously terrified.


143
0:5:39,78 --> 0:5:40,95
So we'll blur his face.


144
0:5:40,95 --> 0:5:41,57
SIMON OSTROVSKY: Yeah,
definitely.


145
0:5:41,57 --> 0:5:43,8
Maybe we should let him know
that we'll do that.


146
0:5:43,8 --> 0:5:44,58
SHANE SMITH: Yeah.


147
0:5:44,58 --> 0:5:46,6
When we told him not to worry
and that we would blur his


148
0:5:46,6 --> 0:5:49,16
face, the North Korean worker
relaxed a little and seemed


149
0:5:49,16 --> 0:5:50,51
much happier.


150
0:5:50,51 --> 0:5:53,47
He also told us that the main
part of the workers group had


151
0:5:53,47 --> 0:5:55,35
moved even further
up the line.


152
0:5:55,35 --> 0:5:57,852
So we got into another train,
and we kept going.


153
0:5:57,852 --> 0:6:17,75



154
0:6:17,75 --> 0:6:18,31
Should we get arrested?


155
0:6:18,31 --> 0:6:19,56
SIMON OSTROVSKY: Yes.


156
0:6:19,56 --> 0:8:19,56
