So fasten your seat belts and throw in your
helmets, it`s CNN STUDENT NEWS time. (END

6
0:0:13,9 --> 0:0:17,649
CARL AZUZ, HOST: A big thanks to Jackson and
C.J. for getting things started today. They`re


7
0:0:17,649 --> 0:0:19,189
ready to go and so are we.


8
0:0:19,189 --> 0:0:36,2
It`s Friday, I`m Carl, and this is CNN STUDENT
NEWS.


9
0:0:36,2 --> 0:0:40,53
Senkaku and Diaoyu -- two different names
for the same set of islands at the center


10
0:0:40,53 --> 0:0:45,35
of some tension between China and Japan. You
can see those two countries on this map. And


11
0:0:45,35 --> 0:0:49,65
right in between them, that`s where you`ll
find these islands in the East China Sea.


12
0:0:49,65 --> 0:0:55,29
There`s not much to them. They`re rocky. They`re
not near much else. No one lives there.


13
0:0:55,29 --> 0:0:56,489
So why is there tension?


14
0:0:56,489 --> 0:1:1,84
Well, China and Japan each say the islands
belong to them. Yesterday, this was seen near


15
0:1:1,84 --> 0:1:6,11
the islands -- a Chinese plane. China said
it was there to carry out a patrol.


16
0:1:6,11 --> 0:1:10,86
Japan launched its own planes in response,
including eight fighter jets. The Chinese


17
0:1:10,86 --> 0:1:15,45
plane was gone by the time the Japanese jets
showed up. And while China and Japan have


18
0:1:15,45 --> 0:1:19,95
been kind of wrestling over these islands
for a while, this was the first time aircraft


19
0:1:19,95 --> 0:1:21,53
were involved.


20
0:1:21,53 --> 0:1:26,37
Next up, a story from Syria`s civil war. Some
of the images from this conflict are difficult


21
0:1:26,37 --> 0:1:30,81
to watch. Some people might find them disturbing,
so we want to make you aware of that, because


22
0:1:30,81 --> 0:1:35,979
this story includes footage of a Syrian woman
who had been shot by a sniper while she was


23
0:1:35,979 --> 0:1:37,27
walking down the street.


24
0:1:37,27 --> 0:1:40,34
We`re showing it to you because of what happened
next.


25
0:1:40,34 --> 0:1:46,45
A Syrian teenager, 17 years old, crawled out
into the street to try to save her. He isn`t


26
0:1:46,45 --> 0:1:50,99
her relative or neighbor. They`ve never met.
He crawled out through the gunfire and put


27
0:1:50,99 --> 0:1:57,299
his own life at risk because he said he knew
he had to save the woman or die trying.


28
0:1:57,299 --> 0:2:1,729
He was able to help get her out of the street.
He wasn`t able to save her life.


29
0:2:1,729 --> 0:2:3,58
Later, he talked with CNN`s Arwa Damon.


30
0:2:3,58 --> 0:2:4,159
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


31
0:2:4,159 --> 0:2:10,359
ARWA DAMON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: "We wanted
to save her, to get her to a hospital. I am


32
0:2:10,359 --> 0:2:13,139
not a hero. I am just like anyone else."


33
0:2:13,139 --> 0:2:14,639
(END VIDEO TAPE)


34
0:2:14,639 --> 0:2:21,159
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Is this legit -- decibels
are a measure of mass.


35
0:2:21,159 --> 0:2:28,189
Not legit. Decibels measure the intensity
of sound, especially loud sounds.


36
0:2:28,189 --> 0:2:36,1
AZUZ: All right, think about when you`re watching
a TV show. If you were measuring the speaker`s


37
0:2:36,1 --> 0:2:40,599
dialogue with a decibel meter, it might look
something like this, a normal speaking voice.


38
0:2:40,599 --> 0:2:44,12
But then a commercial comes on and suddenly
the volume jumps to this.


39
0:2:44,12 --> 0:2:45,909
Take a look at that decibel meter now.


40
0:2:45,909 --> 0:2:49,909
It`s not a problem you`d run into with our
show, but the U.S. government gets thousands


41
0:2:49,909 --> 0:2:54,499
of complaints from people who say that the
advertisements they see are significantly


42
0:2:54,499 --> 0:2:56,59
louder than the shows they`re watching.


43
0:2:56,59 --> 0:3:2,499
Congress passed the Commercial Advertisement
Loudness Mitigation, or CALM Act, in 2010.


44
0:3:2,499 --> 0:3:7,389
It basically says that TV stations, both network
and cable, have to have commercials that are


45
0:3:7,389 --> 0:3:10,18
at the same volume as the shows they`re airing.


46
0:3:10,18 --> 0:3:13,909
Now, not all business owners are on board
with this. They say the whole point of advertising


47
0:3:13,909 --> 0:3:18,269
on TV is to get people`s attention and they`re
concerned that the CALM Act might make that


48
0:3:18,269 --> 0:3:19,529
more difficult.


49
0:3:19,529 --> 0:3:24,389
The fastest growing drug problem in the United
States, you`re looking at it -- prescription


50
0:3:24,389 --> 0:3:28,98
drug abuse. According to the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, one American dies


51
0:3:28,98 --> 0:3:35,279
from a drug overdose every 19 minutes. A pharmaceutical
industry representative says the problem here


52
0:3:35,279 --> 0:3:40,109
is balancing those patients who abuse prescription
drugs with those who use them responsibly,


53
0:3:40,109 --> 0:3:42,529
and, therefore, get the medical benefit from
them.


54
0:3:42,529 --> 0:3:45,549
I spoke about this with CNN`s Dr. Sanjay Gupta
recently.


55
0:3:45,549 --> 0:3:49,1
He had some suggestions for avoiding the dangers
of prescription drugs.


56
0:3:49,1 --> 0:3:49,73
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


57
0:3:49,73 --> 0:3:54,239
AZUZ: Dr. Gupta, we`ve talked about the dangers
of prescription medications on CNN STUDENT


58
0:3:54,239 --> 0:3:54,799
NEWS.


59
0:3:54,799 --> 0:3:56,89
When are these things OK to take?


60
0:3:56,89 --> 0:3:58,809
DR. SANJAY GUPTA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: There
are situations where your doctor is going


61
0:3:58,809 --> 0:4:3,79
to prescribe you these types of medications,
uh, and, you know, presumably, in most cases,


62
0:4:3,79 --> 0:4:6,589
that`s going to be OK to take. I think that
one of the points we try to make is that we


63
0:4:6,589 --> 0:4:11,69
give a lot of pain medications out in this
country and we don`t always try other things


64
0:4:11,69 --> 0:4:11,529
first.


65
0:4:11,529 --> 0:4:15,719
So I think the doctor is going to make a judgment,
but you, as a patient, or whoever is watching,


66
0:4:15,719 --> 0:4:18,66
needs to decide, as well, do I really need
to take narcotics?


67
0:4:18,66 --> 0:4:22,1
Could this be something that could be helped
with something less powerful or -- or just,


68
0:4:22,1 --> 0:4:23,87
you know, something like just stretching and
massage?


69
0:4:23,87 --> 0:4:28,5
AZUZ: Let`s say a student does feel like he
needs it. Maybe he has a sports injury or


70
0:4:28,5 --> 0:4:32,37
something that causes a lot of pain. Maybe
he`s given 10 pills, only needs three or four


71
0:4:32,37 --> 0:4:32,71
of them.


72
0:4:32,71 --> 0:4:34,26
What does he do with the remaining pills?


73
0:4:34,26 --> 0:4:38,51
GUPTA: Well, you know, there is -- this is
a -- actually, a very interesting topic. The


74
0:4:38,51 --> 0:4:41,27
medications themselves, you don`t want to
sort of get them out there in the general


75
0:4:41,27 --> 0:4:44,61
supply, you don`t want them sitting around
in your medicine cabinet, you don`t want them


76
0:4:44,61 --> 0:4:46,2
to flush down the toilet.


77
0:4:46,2 --> 0:4:49,95
Uh, you -- the best thing you could -- you
could probably throw them away. But even better


78
0:4:49,95 --> 0:4:54,64
than that, there are some what are known as
take- back programs, where the DEA will actually


79
0:4:54,64 --> 0:4:58,53
come and take these medications back. Eventually,
they burn them, which is the right thing to


80
0:4:58,53 --> 0:5:0,2
do with these types of medications.


81
0:5:0,2 --> 0:5:3,67
But don`t leave them in your medicine cabinet.
People get tempted. Someone else may take


82
0:5:3,67 --> 0:5:5,71
them and that can be a real problem.


83
0:5:5,71 --> 0:5:10,27
AZUZ: The same hypothetical student who`s
injured has a brother who gets a similar injury.


84
0:5:10,27 --> 0:5:12,41
Is it ever OK for the brother to take his
medication?


85
0:5:12,41 --> 0:5:16,2
GUPTA: It`s -- it`s really not. And -- and,
you know, people do this all the time, I -- I


86
0:5:16,2 --> 0:5:18,92
know. And people watching may say that happens
in our -- in our own home.


87
0:5:18,92 --> 0:5:23,13
The problem is that, you know, everybody is
different. How the medication may react with


88
0:5:23,13 --> 0:5:27,41
somebody could be different. If they`re taking
other medications, those medications could


89
0:5:27,41 --> 0:5:28,57
interact. That could be a problem.


90
0:5:28,57 --> 0:5:32,27
But I think psychologically, if you`re just
sort of getting some pills from another family


91
0:5:32,27 --> 0:5:34,37
member, you may not take it as seriously.


92
0:5:34,37 --> 0:5:37,76
These are -- these are potentially dangerous
pills, and, you know, so you have to treat


93
0:5:37,76 --> 0:5:38,77
it as such.


94
0:5:38,77 --> 0:5:42,86
AZUZ: Especially if they`re taken recreationally,
as some people might take them, to get a buzz.


95
0:5:42,86 --> 0:5:44,68
What are the dangers of doing that?


96
0:5:44,68 --> 0:5:48,1
GUPTA: The -- the biggest danger and these
types of medications, they -- they affect


97
0:5:48,1 --> 0:5:53,33
a part of the brain that actually makes your
body breathe. We`re all breathing like this.


98
0:5:53,33 --> 0:5:53,55
(breathing)


99
0:5:53,55 --> 0:5:57,23
GUPTA: We don`t think about it much. But let`s
say you go to sleep and that part of your


100
0:5:57,23 --> 0:6:2,33
brain has been tinkered with a little bit.
You may start to lose the urge to breathe


101
0:6:2,33 --> 0:6:5,27
and that`s the concern -- you just stop breathing.


102
0:6:5,27 --> 0:6:10,52
And when we say someone dies every 19 minutes,
that`s -- I -- I`ve just described most -- most


103
0:6:10,52 --> 0:6:11,99
likely how it occurs.


104
0:6:11,99 --> 0:6:16,26
The -- the biggest danger with something like
this is that you start to take more and more.


105
0:6:16,26 --> 0:6:20,9
It just doesn`t work as well, so you`re taking
more and more. It`s not treating your pain


106
0:6:20,9 --> 0:6:25,38
or whatever reason you took it for in the
first place, but it is still impairing your


107
0:6:25,38 --> 0:6:25,72
breathing.


108
0:6:25,72 --> 0:6:30,37
So all of a sudden you start to build up that
-- that potentially life-threatening effect


109
0:6:30,37 --> 0:6:31,19
of these pills.


110
0:6:31,19 --> 0:6:34,24
AZUZ: Dr. Gupta, thank you for helping us
understand these things better, helping us


111
0:6:34,24 --> 0:6:36,7
understand how they can hurt us.


112
0:6:36,7 --> 0:6:37,87
GUPTA: Hope it helps.


113
0:6:37,87 --> 0:6:39,23
Thanks a lot.


114
0:6:39,23 --> 0:6:43,95
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today`s Shout Out goes
out to Coach Bradley`s world history class


115
0:6:43,95 --> 0:6:47,7
at Portland High School in Portland, Tennessee.


116
0:6:47,7 --> 0:6:53,3
Wayne Rooney, Abby Wambach and Sergio Ramos
are all known for accomplishments in what


117
0:6:53,3 --> 0:6:53,71
sport?


118
0:6:53,71 --> 0:6:55,11
Here we go.


119
0:6:55,11 --> 0:6:59,42
Is it baseball, soccer, horse racing or auto
racing?


120
0:6:59,42 --> 0:7:1,639
You`ve got three seconds.


121
0:7:1,639 --> 0:7:2,77
Go.


122
0:7:2,77 --> 0:7:5,3
(clock ringing)


123
0:7:5,3 --> 0:7:11,56
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Rooney, Wambach and Ramos
all found fame on the soccer field.


124
0:7:11,56 --> 0:7:16,389
That`s your answer and that`s your Shout Out.


125
0:7:16,389 --> 0:7:22,47
AZUZ: This past Sunday, Lionel Messi did something
that none of those players have done. In fact,


126
0:7:22,47 --> 0:7:27,37
it`s never been done at the top level of soccer
before. Messi, who plays professionally for


127
0:7:27,37 --> 0:7:34,74
Barcelona and plays on Argentina`s national
team, kicked his 86th goal of 2012 -- 74 for


128
0:7:34,74 --> 0:7:37,76
Barcelona, 12 for Argentina.


129
0:7:37,76 --> 0:7:43,26
That broke a record that`s been around for
40 years. And Messi may not be done yet. Barcelona


130
0:7:43,26 --> 0:7:46,77
still has a few more matches to play in 2012.


131
0:7:46,77 --> 0:7:51,7
When Messi or any player scores in the future,
soccer officials want to make sure the ball


132
0:7:51,7 --> 0:7:53,1
crossed the goal line.


133
0:7:53,1 --> 0:7:55,32
Alex Zolbert looks at some technology that
could help out.


134
0:7:55,32 --> 0:7:55,639
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


135
0:7:55,639 --> 0:7:58,95
ALEX ZOLBERT, CNN CORRESPONDENT: So this is
how the GoalRef technology works. Here`s the


136
0:7:58,95 --> 0:8:3,29
soccer ball. Under the skin, you have three
coils around the ball.


137
0:8:3,29 --> 0:8:9,12
On the goal post, you have a magnetic ring
around the goal post. When the ball goes through


138
0:8:9,12 --> 0:8:14,63
the goal post on this watch that the ref wears,
you see goal.


139
0:8:14,63 --> 0:8:19,26
From a confidence point of view, this system
will work during the next games, as we always


140
0:8:19,26 --> 0:8:21,86
expected it and as we saw it during the tests.


141
0:8:21,86 --> 0:8:28,4
ZOLBERT: Then there`s Hawk-Eye. It uses a
series of cameras to capture the ball`s path,


142
0:8:28,4 --> 0:8:33,939
which can then be reviewed within seconds.
Tennis fans know the Hawk-Eye technology well.


143
0:8:33,939 --> 0:8:38,649
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: And right near the sideline,
Karl Good (ph).


144
0:8:38,649 --> 0:8:41,899
ZOLBERT: The technology doesn`t come cheap,
though. FIFA is spending roughly $1 million


145
0:8:41,899 --> 0:8:48,559
U.S. to use the systems here in Japan before
giving the nod to one company for next year`s


146
0:8:48,559 --> 0:8:53,22
Confederations Cup in Brazil, ahead of the
World Cup there in 2014.


147
0:8:53,22 --> 0:8:54,3
(END VIDEO TAPE)


148
0:8:54,3 --> 0:8:56,699
AZUZ: It`s almost time for us to run.


149
0:8:56,699 --> 0:9:2,519
But before we do, it`s time for this little
guy to walk. Nothing like a little kiddy cardio


150
0:9:2,519 --> 0:9:3,459
to get the blood pumping.


151
0:9:3,459 --> 0:9:8,98
Obviously, it`s not an outdoor cat if it prefers
to be on a treadmill. When the pace picks


152
0:9:8,98 --> 0:9:13,769
up, the cat does a pretty good job of keeping
up, although it does hop off for some quick


153
0:9:13,769 --> 0:9:14,529
breaks in here.


154
0:9:14,529 --> 0:9:19,209
It`s nice to see a pet support its owners
workout efforts. Otherwise, it might just


155
0:9:19,209 --> 0:9:19,91
be milling around.


156
0:9:19,91 --> 0:9:23,79
And if you`re thinking of forcing your pet
to get on for a few miles, you`d better make


157
0:9:23,79 --> 0:9:27,3
sure it`s in a good mood, because otherwise,
I`d tread lightly.


158
0:9:27,3 --> 0:9:29,29
It`s a long way to go for that one pun.


159
0:9:29,29 --> 0:9:33,18
But a quick congratulations to Coronado High
School in Henderson, Nevada. A student there


160
0:9:33,18 --> 0:9:34,779
got our social media question right.


161
0:9:34,779 --> 0:9:36,269
We hope all of you have a great weekend.


162
0:9:36,269 --> 0:11:36,269
For CNN STUDENT NEWS, I`m Carl Azuz.
