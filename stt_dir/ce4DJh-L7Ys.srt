0:0:0,857 --> 0:0:3,779
The images you are about to
see are not isolated cases.


2
0:0:3,779 --> 0:0:6,8
These are the Industry Standard
for animals bred as Pets,


3
0:0:6,8 --> 0:0:11,185
Food, Clothing, for
Entertainment and Research.


4
0:0:11,185 --> 0:0:19,163
Viewer discretion is advised.


5
0:0:19,163 --> 0:0:23,7
THE THREE STAGES OF
TRUTH


6
0:0:23,7 --> 0:0:28,2
1. RIDICULE


7
0:0:28,2 --> 0:0:32,7
2. VIOLENT OPPOSITION


8
0:0:32,7 --> 0:0:53,298
3. ACCEPTANCE


9
0:0:53,298 --> 0:1:22,185
EARTHLINGS


10
0:1:22,185 --> 0:1:31,578
earth'ling: n.
One who inhabits of the earth.


11
0:1:31,578 --> 0:1:38,461
Since we all inhabit the earth,
all of us are considered earthlings.


12
0:1:38,461 --> 0:1:43,824
There is no sexism, no racism or
speciesism in the term earthling.


13
0:1:43,824 --> 0:1:46,501
It encompasses each and every one of us:


14
0:1:46,501 --> 0:1:51,96
warm or cold blooded, mammal,
vertebrate or invertebrate,


15
0:1:51,96 --> 0:1:57,529
bird, reptile, amphibian, fish,
and human alike.


16
0:1:57,529 --> 0:2:0,768
Humans, therefore, being not the
only species on the planet,


17
0:2:0,768 --> 0:2:7,58
share this world with millions of other living
creatures, as we all evolve here together.


18
0:2:7,58 --> 0:2:11,383
However, it is the human earthling
who tends to dominate the earth,


19
0:2:11,383 --> 0:2:16,388
often times treating other fellow earthlings
and living beings as mere objects.


20
0:2:16,388 --> 0:2:18,548
This is what is meant by speciesism.


21
0:2:18,548 --> 0:2:21,433
FESTIVAL OF THE BULLS, SPAIN


22
0:2:21,433 --> 0:2:24,918
By analogy with racism and sexism,
the term "speciesism" is a prejudice


23
0:2:24,918 --> 0:2:29,251
or attitude of bias
in favor of the interests


24
0:2:29,251 --> 0:2:35,59
of members of one's own species and
against those of members of other species.


25
0:2:35,59 --> 0:2:37,967
If a being suffers there can be
no moral justification for


26
0:2:37,967 --> 0:2:41,296
refusing to take that
suffering into consideration.


27
0:2:41,296 --> 0:2:46,36
No matter what the nature of the
being, the principle of equality requires


28
0:2:46,36 --> 0:3:7,27
that one's suffering can be counted equally
with the like suffering of any other being.


29
0:3:7,27 --> 0:3:11,843
Racists violate the principle of
equality by giving greater eight


30
0:3:11,843 --> 0:3:13,575
to the interests of members


31
0:3:13,575 --> 0:3:17,55
of their own race when
their is a clash between their


32
0:3:17,55 --> 0:3:26,271
interests and the interests
of those of another race.


33
0:3:26,271 --> 0:3:30,938
Sexists violate the principle of
equality by favoring


34
0:3:30,938 --> 0:3:40,194
the interests of their own sex.


35
0:3:40,194 --> 0:3:47,34
Similarly, speciesists allow
the interests of their own species


36
0:3:47,34 --> 0:3:55,633
to override the greater interests
of members of other species.


37
0:3:55,633 --> 0:4:6,413
In each case, the pattern is identical.


38
0:4:6,413 --> 0:4:11,903
Though among the members of the human family
we recognize the moral imperative of respect


39
0:4:11,903 --> 0:4:15,188
(every human is a somebody, not a something),


40
0:4:15,188 --> 0:4:18,473
morally disrespectful treatment occurs
when those who stand at the power end of a


41
0:4:18,473 --> 0:4:28,895
power relationship treat the less powerful
as if they were mere objects.


42
0:4:28,895 --> 0:4:32,254
The rapist does this to the victim of rape.


43
0:4:32,254 --> 0:4:35,691
The child molester
to the child molested.


44
0:4:35,691 --> 0:4:38,673
The master to the slave.


45
0:4:38,673 --> 0:4:45,595
In each and all such cases, humans who
have power exploit those who lack it.


46
0:4:45,595 --> 0:4:54,109
Might the same be true of how humans
treat other animals, or other earthlings?


47
0:4:54,109 --> 0:4:56,188
Undoubtedly there are differences,


48
0:4:56,188 --> 0:5:3,421
since humans and animals are
not the same in all respects.


49
0:5:3,421 --> 0:5:9,469
But the question of sameness
wears another face.


50
0:5:9,469 --> 0:5:15,89
Granted, these animals do not have
all the desires we humans have;


51
0:5:15,89 --> 0:5:20,112
granted, they do not comprehend
everything we humans comprehend;


52
0:5:20,112 --> 0:5:22,966
nevertheless, we and they do have
some of the same desires


53
0:5:22,966 --> 0:5:26,712
and do comprehend some of the same things.


54
0:5:26,712 --> 0:5:31,484
The desires for food and water,
shelter and companionship,


55
0:5:31,484 --> 0:5:34,719
freedom of movement
and avoidance of pain?


56
0:5:34,719 --> 0:5:42,371
these desires are shared by
nonhuman animals and human beings.


57
0:5:42,371 --> 0:5:44,796
As for comprehension: like humans,


58
0:5:44,796 --> 0:5:49,788
many nonhuman animals understand the
world in which they live and move.


59
0:5:49,788 --> 0:5:54,902
Otherwise, they could not survive.


60
0:5:54,902 --> 0:6:0,915
So beneath the many differences,
there is sameness.


61
0:6:0,915 --> 0:6:6,811
Like us, these animals embody the
mystery and wonder of consciousness.


62
0:6:6,811 --> 0:6:11,53
Like us, they are not only in the world,
they are aware of it.


63
0:6:11,53 --> 0:6:18,23
Like us they are the psychological
centers of a life that is uniquely their own.


64
0:6:18,23 --> 0:6:22,885
In these fundamental respects humans
stand "on all fours", so to speak,


65
0:6:22,885 --> 0:6:26,747
with hogs and cows,
chickens and turkeys.


66
0:6:26,747 --> 0:6:30,765
What these animals are due from us,
how we morally ought to treat them,


67
0:6:30,765 --> 0:6:34,186
are questions whose answer begins
with the recognition of our


68
0:6:34,186 --> 0:6:38,771
psychological kinship with them.


69
0:6:38,771 --> 0:6:40,638
So the following film demonstrates


70
0:6:40,638 --> 0:6:45,45
in five ways just how animals
have come to serve mankind


71
0:6:45,45 --> 0:7:0,953
...lest we forget.


72
0:7:0,953 --> 0:7:5,719
Nobel Prize winner Isaac Bashevis Singer
wrote in his bestselling novel


73
0:7:5,719 --> 0:7:8,975
'Enemies, A Love Story' the following:


74
0:7:8,975 --> 0:7:13,644
"As often has Herman had witnessed
the slaughter of animals and fish,


75
0:7:13,644 --> 0:7:17,912
he always had the same thought:
in their behavior toward creatures,


76
0:7:17,912 --> 0:7:22,543
all men were Nazis. The smugness with
which man could do with other species


77
0:7:22,543 --> 0:7:26,892
as he pleased exemplified the most
extreme racist theories,


78
0:7:26,892 --> 0:7:32,837
the principle that might is right".


79
0:7:32,837 --> 0:7:37,998
The comparison here to the holocaust
is both intentional and obvious:


80
0:7:37,998 --> 0:7:43,335
one group of living beings anguishes beneath
the hands of another.


81
0:7:43,335 --> 0:7:46,726
Though some will argue the suffering
of animals cannot possibly compare


82
0:7:46,726 --> 0:7:52,484
with that of former Jews or slaves,
there is, in fact, a parallel.


83
0:7:52,484 --> 0:7:58,28
And for the prisoners and victims
of this mass murder, their holocaust


84
0:7:58,28 --> 0:8:17,885
is far from over.


85
0:8:17,885 --> 0:8:22,77
In his book 'The Outermost House'
author Henry Beston wrote


86
0:8:22,77 --> 0:8:26,23
"We need another and a wiser
and perhaps a more mystical


87
0:8:26,23 --> 0:8:30,13
concept of animals.


88
0:8:30,13 --> 0:8:34,883
Remote from universal nature,
and living by complicated artifice,


89
0:8:34,883 --> 0:8:36,683
man in civilization surveys


90
0:8:36,683 --> 0:8:41,938
the creatures through
the glass of his knowledge


91
0:8:41,938 --> 0:8:46,645
and sees thereby a feather magnified
and the whole image in distortion.


92
0:8:46,645 --> 0:8:49,413
We patronize them for their incompleteness,


93
0:8:49,413 --> 0:8:55,88
for their tragic fate of having taken
form so far below ourselves.


94
0:8:55,88 --> 0:8:59,93
And therein we err, and greatly err.


95
0:8:59,93 --> 0:9:4,584
For the animal
shall not be measured by man.


96
0:9:4,584 --> 0:9:8,22
In a world older and
more complete than ours


97
0:9:8,22 --> 0:9:13,888
they move finished and complete,


98
0:9:13,888 --> 0:9:22,601
gifted with extensions of the senses
we have lost or never attained,


99
0:9:22,601 --> 0:9:31,236
living by voices we shall never hear.


100
0:9:31,236 --> 0:9:37,523
They are not brethren;
they are not underlings;


101
0:9:37,523 --> 0:9:40,759
they are other nations,


102
0:9:40,759 --> 0:9:45,277
caught with ourselves
in the net of life and time,


103
0:9:45,277 --> 0:9:56,148
fellow prisoners of the splendor
and travail of the earth".


104
0:9:56,148 --> 0:10:1,162
PART ONE: PETS


105
0:10:1,162 --> 0:10:7,942
For most of us, our relationship with animals
involves the owning of a pet or two.


106
0:10:7,942 --> 0:10:12,335
So where do our pets come from?


107
0:10:12,335 --> 0:10:20,314
Of course, one of the most obvious ways
animals serve man is as companions.


108
0:10:20,314 --> 0:10:22,205
BREEDERS


109
0:10:22,205 --> 0:10:28,173
For these pets it starts with a breeder,
though not all breeders are considered professional.


110
0:10:28,173 --> 0:10:32,949
In fact, in this profession, just about anyone
and everyone can be a breeder.


111
0:10:32,949 --> 0:10:36,2
PET STORES AND PUPPY MILLS


112
0:10:36,2 --> 0:10:41,17
For pet stores, most of their animals
are acquired from puppy mills,


113
0:10:41,17 --> 0:10:47,443
even if they may not know it.


114
0:10:47,443 --> 0:10:49,341
Puppy mills are low-budget


115
0:10:49,341 --> 0:11:4,682
commercial enterprises that breed dogs
for sale to pet shops and other buyers.


116
0:11:4,682 --> 0:11:7,405
They are often backyard operations


117
0:11:7,405 --> 0:11:18,38
that expose animals to filthy, overcrowded
conditions with no veterinary care or socialization.


118
0:11:18,38 --> 0:11:20,857
Dogs from puppy mills often exhibit


119
0:11:20,857 --> 0:11:28,389
physical and psychological
problems as they grow up.


120
0:11:28,389 --> 0:11:30,584
STRAYS


121
0:11:30,584 --> 0:11:34,614
Strays, if they are lucky,
will be picked up and taken to a


122
0:11:34,614 --> 0:11:45,73
shelter or pound, where they
can only hope to find a new home again.


123
0:11:45,73 --> 0:11:53,909
An estimated 25 million animals become
homeless every year.


124
0:11:53,909 --> 0:12:11,872
And as many as 27% of purebred dogs
are among the homeless.


125
0:12:11,872 --> 0:12:15,674
Of these 25 million homeless animals
an average of 9 million


126
0:12:15,674 --> 0:12:18,881
die on the streets from disease,


127
0:12:18,881 --> 0:12:22,845
starvation,


128
0:12:22,845 --> 0:12:26,217
exposure,


129
0:12:26,217 --> 0:12:31,46
injury, or some other hazard
of street life.


130
0:12:31,46 --> 0:12:36,94
Many others are strays, some of whom were
presumably dumped in the streets by their caretakers


131
0:12:36,94 --> 0:12:41,73
The remaining 16 million
die in pounds or shelters that have no


132
0:12:41,73 --> 0:12:51,175
room for them and are forced to kill them.


133
0:12:51,175 --> 0:12:53,129
Sadly, on top of all this,


134
0:12:53,129 --> 0:13:2,306
almost 50% of the animals brought to
shelters are turned in by their caretakers.


135
0:13:2,306 --> 0:13:8,864
Many people claim they don't visit shelters
because it's depressing for them.


136
0:13:8,864 --> 0:13:13,871
But the reason animals are crowded
into such dreary places as these,


137
0:13:13,871 --> 0:13:19,655
is because of people's refusal
to spay or neuter their pets.


138
0:13:19,655 --> 0:13:23,868
Several pet owners feel,
particularly men for some reason,


139
0:13:23,868 --> 0:13:29,688
that neutering a pet
emasculates the owner somehow ...


140
0:13:29,688 --> 0:13:46,233
... or they may just want their children to someday
experience the "miracle of life", so to speak.


141
0:13:46,233 --> 0:13:51,673
In either case, pet owners like these
unknowingly take part in the euthanasia


142
0:13:51,673 --> 0:13:57,306
of over 60,000 animals per day.


143
0:13:57,306 --> 0:14:3,894
Euthanasia, generally defined as the act
of killing painlessly for reasons of mercy,


144
0:14:3,894 --> 0:14:8,223
is usually administered by
an injection in the leg for dogs,


145
0:14:8,223 --> 0:14:17,455
and sometimes in the
stomach for cats.


146
0:14:17,455 --> 0:14:24,412
It is a quick and painless procedure for
the animals, and by far the most humane,


147
0:14:24,412 --> 0:14:30,766
but not always the most affordable.


148
0:14:30,766 --> 0:14:33,878
Due to the increase of
euthanasia in shelters,


149
0:14:33,878 --> 0:14:38,138
and the growing, constant,
demand for drugs like Euthasol,


150
0:14:38,138 --> 0:14:47,4
some shelters with budget constraints
are forced to use gas chambers instead.


151
0:14:47,4 --> 0:14:48,881
GAS CHAMBERS


152
0:14:48,881 --> 0:14:52,313
In a gas chamber,
animals are packed very tightly


153
0:14:52,313 --> 0:15:7,993
and can take as long as
20 minutes to die.


154
0:15:7,993 --> 0:15:11,52
It is, by far, less merciful,


155
0:15:11,52 --> 0:15:14,568
more traumatic and painful.


156
0:15:14,568 --> 0:15:25,912
But the procedure is less expensive.


157
0:15:25,912 --> 0:15:29,692
Perhaps some of the tough questions
we should ask ourselves about animals


158
0:15:29,692 --> 0:15:33,304
that we keep as companions are:


159
0:15:33,304 --> 0:15:37,435
Can we keep animals as companions
and still address their needs?


160
0:15:37,435 --> 0:15:40,579
Is our keeping companion animals
in their best interest,


161
0:15:40,579 --> 0:15:43,55
or are we exploiting them?


162
0:15:43,55 --> 0:15:48,545
The answers to these questions may lie
in the attitudes of the human caretakers


163
0:15:48,545 --> 0:16:21,237
and their abilities to provide suitable
environments for companion animals.


164
0:16:21,237 --> 0:16:24,443
(CYANIDE POISON)
Most human beings are speciesists.


165
0:16:24,443 --> 0:16:28,857
This film shows that ordinary
human beings (not a few exceptionally


166
0:16:28,857 --> 0:16:32,665
cruel or heartless humans, but the
overwhelming majority of people),


167
0:16:32,665 --> 0:16:36,726
take an active part in,
acquiesce in, and allow their taxes


168
0:16:36,726 --> 0:16:40,917
to pay for practices that require
the sacrifice of the most important


169
0:16:40,917 --> 0:16:44,795
interests of members of other species,
in order to promote the most


170
0:16:44,795 --> 0:16:49,833
trivial interests of our own species.


171
0:16:49,833 --> 0:17:0,94
STRAY OVERPOPULATION IN TURKEY


172
0:17:0,94 --> 0:17:2,556
The hope for the animals of tomorrow is


173
0:17:2,556 --> 0:17:16,88
to be found in a Human Culture
which learns to feel beyond itself.


174
0:17:16,88 --> 0:17:23,338
We must learn empathy,


175
0:17:23,338 --> 0:17:25,727
we must learn to see into the eyes


176
0:17:25,727 --> 0:17:45,966
of an animal and feel that their
life has value because they are alive.


177
0:17:45,966 --> 0:17:51,934
PART TWO: FOOD


178
0:17:51,934 --> 0:18:4,868
"Oh, I missed. I missed you, honey.
But I'll get you again!"


179
0:18:4,868 --> 0:18:11,255
"I got you! Good boy!"


180
0:18:11,255 --> 0:18:13,667
What happens in slaughterhouses


181
0:18:13,667 --> 0:18:32,642
is a variation on the theme of the
exploitation of the weak by the strong.


182
0:18:32,642 --> 0:18:35,111
More than ten thousand times a minute,


183
0:18:35,111 --> 0:18:39,821
in excess of six billion times a
year, just in the United States,


184
0:18:39,821 --> 0:18:44,738
life is literally
drained from so-called "food animals".


185
0:18:44,738 --> 0:18:49,271
Having the greater power,
humans decide when these animals will die,


186
0:18:49,271 --> 0:18:50,82
where they will die,


187
0:18:50,82 --> 0:18:53,97
and how they will die.


188
0:18:53,97 --> 0:18:55,947
The interests of these animals themselves


189
0:18:55,947 --> 0:19:1,342
play no role whatsoever
in the determination of their fate.


190
0:19:1,342 --> 0:19:5,442
Killing an animal is,
in itself, a troubling act.


191
0:19:5,442 --> 0:19:7,379
It has been said that if we had


192
0:19:7,379 --> 0:19:11,282
to kill our own meat, we
would all be vegetarians.


193
0:19:11,282 --> 0:19:14,365
Certainly very few people
ever visit a slaughterhouse,


194
0:19:14,365 --> 0:19:19,86
and films of slaughterhouse operations
are not popular on television.


195
0:19:19,86 --> 0:19:24,869
People might hope that the meat they buy
came from an animal who died without pain,


196
0:19:24,869 --> 0:19:27,696
but they don't really
want to know about it.


197
0:19:27,696 --> 0:19:32,219
Yet those who, by their purchases,
require animals to be killed,


198
0:19:32,219 --> 0:19:37,533
do not deserve to be shielded from this
or any other aspect of the production


199
0:19:37,533 --> 0:19:39,373
of the meat they buy.


200
0:19:39,373 --> 0:19:44,17
So where does our food come from?


201
0:19:44,17 --> 0:19:49,166
For those of us living on a meat diet,
the process these animals


202
0:19:49,166 --> 0:19:52,349
undergoes is as follows.


203
0:19:52,349 --> 0:19:57,363
BRANDING


204
0:19:57,363 --> 0:20:1,494
For beef, the animals are all branded ...


205
0:20:1,494 --> 0:20:7,657
... in this instance, on the face.


206
0:20:7,657 --> 0:20:10,784
DEHORNING


207
0:20:10,784 --> 0:20:14,704
Dehorning usually follows.
Never with anesthetic.


208
0:20:14,704 --> 0:20:32,789
But rather a large pair of pliers.


209
0:20:32,789 --> 0:20:36,176
TRANSPORTATION


210
0:20:36,176 --> 0:20:40,53
In transportation, animals are packed
so tightly into trucks, they are


211
0:20:40,53 --> 0:20:42,475
practically on top of one another.


212
0:20:42,475 --> 0:20:47,116
Heat, freezing temperatures,
fatigue, trauma, and health conditions


213
0:20:47,116 --> 0:20:51,313
will kill some of these animals
in route to the slaughterhouses.


214
0:20:51,313 --> 0:20:54,189
MILKING


215
0:20:54,189 --> 0:20:56,146
Milking cows are kept chained


216
0:20:56,146 --> 0:21:1,572
to their stalls all day
long, receiving no exercise.


217
0:21:1,572 --> 0:21:22,441
Pesticides and antibiotics are also
used to increase their milk productivity.


218
0:21:22,441 --> 0:21:29,64
Eventually, milking cows,
like this one, collapse from exhaustion.


219
0:21:29,64 --> 0:21:32,98
Normally, cows can live
as long as twenty years,


220
0:21:32,98 --> 0:21:37,333
but milking cows
generally die within four.


221
0:21:37,333 --> 0:21:42,829
At which point, their meat is
used for fast food restaurants.


222
0:21:42,829 --> 0:21:48,878
MEAT


223
0:21:48,878 --> 0:21:50,88
At this slaughterhouse,


224
0:21:50,88 --> 0:21:54,347
the branded and dehorned
cattle are brought into a stall.


225
0:21:54,347 --> 0:21:57,181
CAPTIVE BOLTS


226
0:21:57,181 --> 0:21:59,196
The captive bolt gun, which was designed


227
0:21:59,196 --> 0:22:4,859
to reduce animals unconscious
without causing pain,


228
0:22:4,859 --> 0:22:9,921
fires a steel bolt, that is powered
by compressed air or a blank cartridge,


229
0:22:9,921 --> 0:22:12,115
right into the animal's brain.


230
0:22:12,115 --> 0:22:16,668
BLEEDING


231
0:22:16,668 --> 0:22:22,557
Though various methods of slaughter
are used, in this Massachusetts facility,


232
0:22:22,557 --> 0:22:27,625
the cattle is hoisted up
and his or her throat is slit.


233
0:22:27,625 --> 0:22:42,47
Along with the meat, their blood will
be used as well.


234
0:22:42,47 --> 0:22:46,8
Though the animal has received
a captive bolt to the head,


235
0:22:46,8 --> 0:22:48,509
which is supposed to have rendered him


236
0:22:48,509 --> 0:22:54,943
or her senseless ... as you can see
the animal is still conscious.


237
0:22:54,943 --> 0:22:57,51
This is not uncommon.


238
0:22:57,51 --> 0:23:1,552
Sometimes they are still alive
even after they have been bled,


239
0:23:1,552 --> 0:23:12,542
and are well on their way down
the assembly line to be butchered.


240
0:23:12,542 --> 0:23:52,466
KNOCKING BOXES


241
0:23:52,466 --> 0:23:57,189
KOSHER SLAUGHTER


242
0:23:57,189 --> 0:24:1,829
This is the largest glatt kosher
meat plant in the United States.


243
0:24:1,829 --> 0:24:12,412
Glatt, the Yiddish word for "smooth",
means the highest standard of cleanliness ...


244
0:24:12,412 --> 0:24:24,159
... and rules for kosher
butchering require minimal suffering.


245
0:24:24,159 --> 0:24:32,41
The use of electric prods
on immobilized animals is a violation.


246
0:24:32,41 --> 0:24:36,67
SHEKHITA - RITUAL SLAUGHTER


247
0:24:36,67 --> 0:24:40,775
Inverting frightened animals
for the slaughterer's convenience


248
0:24:40,775 --> 0:24:48,922
is also a violation.


249
0:24:48,922 --> 0:24:59,11
The inversion process causes cattle to
aspirate blood, or breath it in, after incision.


250
0:24:59,11 --> 0:25:3,199
Ripping the trachea and esophagi
from their throats is another


251
0:25:3,199 --> 0:25:7,882
egregious violation, since kosher
animals are not to be touched ...


252
0:25:7,882 --> 0:25:23,262
... until bleeding stops.


253
0:25:23,262 --> 0:25:27,2
And by dumping struggling
and dying steers through metal chutes


254
0:25:27,2 --> 0:25:30,301
onto blood soaked floors,


255
0:25:30,301 --> 0:25:38,88
with their breathing tubes
and gullets dangling out,


256
0:25:38,88 --> 0:25:46,392
this "sacred task" is neither
clean or compassionate.


257
0:25:46,392 --> 0:25:50,403
Shackling and hoisting is
ruled yet another violation,


258
0:25:50,403 --> 0:25:56,632
nor does it correspond to the
kosher way of treating animals.


259
0:25:56,632 --> 0:26:3,527
If this was kosher, death was
neither quick nor merciful.


260
0:26:3,527 --> 0:26:5,94
VEAL


261
0:26:5,94 --> 0:26:10,449
Veal, taken from their mothers
within two days of birth, are tied


262
0:26:10,449 --> 0:26:15,894
at the neck and kept restricted
to keep muscles from developing.


263
0:26:15,894 --> 0:26:18,871
Fed an iron-deficient liquid diet,


264
0:26:18,871 --> 0:26:22,558
denied bedding,
water, and light,


265
0:26:22,558 --> 0:26:26,631
after four months of this miserable
existence they are slaughtered.


266
0:26:26,631 --> 0:26:32,57
PIGS


267
0:26:32,57 --> 0:26:35,448
Sows in factory farms are
breeding machines, kept


268
0:26:35,448 --> 0:26:40,324
continually pregnant by means
of artificial insemination.


269
0:26:40,324 --> 0:26:44,244
Large pig market factories
will "manufacture",


270
0:26:44,244 --> 0:26:51,812
as they like to call it, between 50,000
and 600,000 pigs a year... each.


271
0:26:51,812 --> 0:27:10,287
FACTORY CONDITIONS


272
0:27:10,287 --> 0:27:21,779
GESTATION CRATES


273
0:27:21,779 --> 0:27:38,415
RUPTURES & ABSCESSES


274
0:27:38,415 --> 0:28:5,959
CANIBALISM


275
0:28:5,959 --> 0:28:30,743
WASTE PITS


276
0:28:30,743 --> 0:28:35,479
Tail docking is a practice derived
from the lack of space and stressful


277
0:28:35,479 --> 0:28:41,707
living conditions so as to keep pigs
from biting each other's tails off.


278
0:28:41,707 --> 0:28:44,189
This is done without anesthetic.


279
0:28:44,189 --> 0:28:47,194
EAR CLIPPING


280
0:28:47,194 --> 0:29:3,817
Ear clipping is a similar procedure,
also administered without anesthetic.


281
0:29:3,817 --> 0:29:25,745
As well as teeth-cutting.


282
0:29:25,745 --> 0:29:28,693
CASTRATION


283
0:29:28,693 --> 0:29:33,31
Castration is also done without
painkillers or anesthetic, and will


284
0:29:33,31 --> 0:29:46,675
supposedly produce a more
fatty grade of meat.


285
0:29:46,675 --> 0:29:49,868
ELECTRIC PRODS


286
0:29:49,868 --> 0:30:21,194
The electric prods are used for
obvious reasons: handling.


287
0:30:21,194 --> 0:30:25,701
ELECTROCUTION


288
0:30:25,701 --> 0:30:34,793
Electrocution is another method
of slaughter, as seen here.


289
0:30:34,793 --> 0:30:36,78
THROAT SLITTING


290
0:30:36,78 --> 0:30:38,236
Throat slitting, however,


291
0:30:38,236 --> 0:31:5,508
is still the least expensive
way to kill an animal.


292
0:31:5,508 --> 0:31:11,69
BOILING AND HAIR REMOVAL


293
0:31:11,69 --> 0:31:15,12
After knife sticking, pigs are shackled,


294
0:31:15,12 --> 0:31:21,811
suspended on a bleed-rail and immersed
in scalding tanks to remove their bristle.


295
0:31:21,811 --> 0:31:27,566
Many are still struggling as they are dunked
upside down in tanks of steaming water,


296
0:31:27,566 --> 0:32:7,52
where they are submerged and drowned.


297
0:32:7,52 --> 0:32:11,807
POULTRY


298
0:32:11,807 --> 0:32:17,852
In regard to poultry, Americans currently
consume as much chicken in a single day


299
0:32:17,852 --> 0:32:24,785
as they did in an entire year in 1930.


300
0:32:24,785 --> 0:32:29,33
The largest broiler companies
in the world now slaughter more than


301
0:32:29,33 --> 0:32:43,515
8.5 million birds in a single week.


302
0:32:43,515 --> 0:32:49,7
DEBEAKING


303
0:32:49,7 --> 0:32:53,424
Debeaking prevents feather-pecking
and cannibalism in frustrated chickens,


304
0:32:53,424 --> 0:33:6,596
caused by over-crowding in single areas, where
they are unable to establish a social order.


305
0:33:6,596 --> 0:33:11,676
Today, done with infant chicks,
the procedure is carried out very quickly,


306
0:33:11,676 --> 0:33:14,121
about 15 birds a minute.


307
0:33:14,121 --> 0:33:20,9
Such haste means the temperature and
sharpness of the blade varies, resulting in


308
0:33:20,9 --> 0:33:24,451
sloppy cutting and serious
injury to the bird.


309
0:33:24,451 --> 0:33:26,661
LIVING CONDITIONS


310
0:33:26,661 --> 0:33:31,344
As for their living conditions, anywhere
from sixty to ninety thousand birds can be


311
0:33:31,344 --> 0:33:45,729
crowded together in a single building.


312
0:33:45,729 --> 0:33:51,603
The suffering for these animals is
unrelenting. It is a way of life.


313
0:33:51,603 --> 0:34:1,951
Although their beaks are severed,
they attempt to peck each other.


314
0:34:1,951 --> 0:34:10,518
For hens, they live in a laying warehouse,
crammed inside so-called "battery cages".


315
0:34:10,518 --> 0:34:13,846
BATTERY CAGES


316
0:34:13,846 --> 0:34:23,43
Many lose their feathers and develop
sores from rubbing against the wire cage.


317
0:34:23,43 --> 0:34:28,43
Crowding prevents them from
spreading their wings, and the hens cannot


318
0:34:28,43 --> 0:34:32,231
even fulfill minimal natural instincts.


319
0:34:32,231 --> 0:34:34,4
TRANSPORTATION


320
0:34:34,4 --> 0:34:41,251
During transportation,
all animals suffer, and many die.


321
0:34:41,251 --> 0:34:45,46
And they suffocate when other
animals pile on top of them


322
0:34:45,46 --> 0:34:50,389
in overcrowded, poorly loaded cages.


323
0:34:50,389 --> 0:34:56,124
SLAUGHTER


324
0:34:56,124 --> 0:35:30,709
"THE HANG PEN"
MOOREFIELD, WEST VIRGINIA


325
0:35:30,709 --> 0:35:35,756
Chickens and turkeys are
slaughtered in numerous ways.


326
0:35:35,756 --> 0:35:51,96
Some may be clubbed to death
or have their heads cut off.


327
0:35:51,96 --> 0:36:1,72
But most are brought through
the assembly lines of factory farms.


328
0:36:1,72 --> 0:36:6,749
Dangled upside down on a conveyor belt,
their throats are slit,


329
0:36:6,749 --> 0:36:17,739
and they are left to bleed to death.


330
0:36:17,739 --> 0:36:21,709
Others may be placed head-first
in tubes to restrict their movement


331
0:36:21,709 --> 0:36:27,323
while they slowly bleed to death.


332
0:36:27,323 --> 0:36:34,574
Surely, if slaughterhouses had glass walls,
would not all of us be vegetarians?


333
0:36:34,574 --> 0:36:37,24
But slaughterhouses do not have glass walls.


334
0:36:37,24 --> 0:36:41,675
The architecture of slaughter is opaque,
designed in the interest of denial,


335
0:36:41,675 --> 0:36:46,9
to insure that we will not see even if
we wanted to look. And who wants to look?


336
0:36:46,9 --> 0:36:58,32
"Go mother fucker!
Don't fuckin' stop".


337
0:36:58,32 --> 0:37:16,805
"Let's go, let's go!!!
Come on, bitch!"


338
0:37:16,805 --> 0:37:20,124
It was Emerson who observed,
more than a hundred years ago,


339
0:37:20,124 --> 0:37:25,653
"You have dined, and however scrupulously
the slaughterhouse is concealed in


340
0:37:25,653 --> 0:38:15,635
the graceful distance of miles,
there is complicity".


341
0:38:15,635 --> 0:38:21,575
SEA FOOD


342
0:38:21,575 --> 0:38:26,237
And for those who think eating seafood
is "healthier" than land animals,


343
0:38:26,237 --> 0:38:30,555
just remember how much irretrievable
waste and contaminated sediments


344
0:38:30,555 --> 0:38:33,606
are dumped into our oceans.


345
0:38:33,606 --> 0:38:38,9
In the past ... oil ... nuclear ... and chemical
industries have done little for the


346
0:38:38,9 --> 0:38:41,476
protection of marine environments ...


347
0:38:41,476 --> 0:38:48,104
... and dumping on or under the seabed has
always proved a convenient place


348
0:38:48,104 --> 0:38:56,807
to dispose of inconvenient wastes.


349
0:38:56,807 --> 0:39:2,46
COMMERCIAL FISHING


350
0:39:2,46 --> 0:39:8,218
Today's commercial fishers intensify
this situation on massive scales.


351
0:39:8,218 --> 0:39:11,83
They use vast factory
trawlers the size of


352
0:39:11,83 --> 0:39:20,78
football fields and advanced electronic
equipment to track and catch fish.


353
0:39:20,78 --> 0:39:26,998
Huge nets stretch across the ocean,
swallowing up everything in their path.


354
0:39:26,998 --> 0:39:31,608
These factory trawlers, coupled with
our increased appetites for seafood,


355
0:39:31,608 --> 0:39:41,133
are emptying the oceans of
sea life at an alarming pace.


356
0:39:41,133 --> 0:39:48,191
Already, thirteen of the seventeen major global
fisheries are depleted or in serious decline.


357
0:39:48,191 --> 0:39:52,445
The other four are
overexploited or fully exploited.


358
0:39:52,445 --> 0:40:0,204
DISEASE


359
0:40:0,204 --> 0:40:2,585
The recent outbreak of Pfiesteria,


360
0:40:2,585 --> 0:40:6,911
a microorganism 1,000 time
more potent than cyanide,


361
0:40:6,911 --> 0:40:12,9
spawned from millions of gallons of
raw hog feces and urine, poured into rivers,


362
0:40:12,9 --> 0:40:16,794
lakes, and oceans, turning their
ecosystems into unflushed toilets,


363
0:40:16,794 --> 0:40:21,256
is proving the most alarming.


364
0:40:21,256 --> 0:40:26,422
Threatening sea life and humans alike,
Pfiesteria has killed over 1 billion fish,


365
0:40:26,422 --> 0:40:30,195
the southeast's largest fishkill on record,


366
0:40:30,195 --> 0:40:34,565
and it's spreading.


367
0:40:34,565 --> 0:40:40,24
Traces of Pfiesteria have already been found
from Long Island to the Florida Gulf,


368
0:40:40,24 --> 0:40:43,735
at distances of up to 1,000 miles.


369
0:40:43,735 --> 0:40:46,791
In fact, this water-based
Pfiesteria invasion


370
0:40:46,791 --> 0:40:52,842
stands as one of the worst outbreaks of
a virulent microorganism in U.S history.


371
0:40:52,842 --> 0:41:0,237
It is a Level Three
Biohazard. Ebola is a Four. AIDS is a two.


372
0:41:0,237 --> 0:41:5,352
And this bug mutated as a direct result
of our mass consumption of animals,


373
0:41:5,352 --> 0:41:9,122
particularly pork.


374
0:41:9,122 --> 0:41:16,795
With hog farms fattening millions of pigs for
slaughter, grain goes in and waste comes out.


375
0:41:16,795 --> 0:41:20,998
HURRICANE FLOYD
NORTH CAROLINA, 1999


376
0:41:20,998 --> 0:41:23,996
This waste finds its way into our oceans and
water-supply systems,


377
0:41:23,996 --> 0:41:27,452
contaminating the animals that live in it,


378
0:41:27,452 --> 0:41:32,273
as well as those that eat from it.


379
0:41:32,273 --> 0:41:38,287
WHALING


380
0:41:38,287 --> 0:41:40,553
Finally, whaling.


381
0:41:40,553 --> 0:41:45,466
Though the International Whaling Commission
prohibited commercial whaling in 1985,


382
0:41:45,466 --> 0:42:1,27
many countries continue to kill
whales for their so-called "exotic meat".


383
0:42:1,27 --> 0:42:4,85
They use harpoons,


384
0:42:4,85 --> 0:42:6,763
firearms,


385
0:42:6,763 --> 0:42:9,21
blunt hooks,


386
0:42:9,21 --> 0:42:12,94
even explosives,


387
0:42:12,94 --> 0:42:15,382
or drive them into
authorized whaling bays


388
0:42:15,382 --> 0:42:45,257
where they are made to beach and can
be killed with knives in the shallows.


389
0:42:45,257 --> 0:42:51,599
DOLPHINS


390
0:42:51,599 --> 0:42:57,705
Every winter, between the months of October
through March, thousands of dolphins are


391
0:42:57,705 --> 0:43:6,339
confined and brutally killed
in small towns across Japan.


392
0:43:6,339 --> 0:43:16,808
Sounding rods beneath the water's surface
interfere with the dolphin's sonar.


393
0:43:16,808 --> 0:43:26,201
Once disoriented and enclosed
within the nets, the dolphins panic.


394
0:43:26,201 --> 0:43:31,676
Fisherman often injure a few captive dolphins
with a spear thrust or knife slash ...


395
0:43:31,676 --> 0:43:38,415
since dolphins never abandon
wounded family members.


396
0:43:38,415 --> 0:43:42,48
Mothers and babies call out in
distress as they are separated,


397
0:43:42,48 --> 0:43:56,408
hoisted up and dragged off
... soon to be mercilessly hacked to death.


398
0:43:56,408 --> 0:44:1,257
these are benign and innocent beings ...


399
0:44:1,257 --> 0:44:41,29
... and they deserve better.


400
0:44:41,29 --> 0:44:44,622
Yet here, as they lay
stricken and needful,


401
0:44:44,622 --> 0:44:50,193
wreathing helplessly on cement
floors, they are cut open with machetes


402
0:44:50,193 --> 0:45:3,302
and left to slowly suffocate ...


403
0:45:3,302 --> 0:45:27,303
... convulsing and contorting in the throes
of agony ... while school children walk on by.


404
0:45:27,303 --> 0:45:32,571
Such images of slaughter and bloody red water
clearly show the Japanese government has


405
0:45:32,571 --> 0:45:37,293
little respect for the state of the world's
oceans with their inhumane methods of


406
0:45:37,293 --> 0:45:42,72
fishing ... often in violation of international
treaties, laws and conventions designed


407
0:45:42,72 --> 0:45:45,566
to protect over-exploiting the oceans ...


408
0:45:45,566 --> 0:45:51,601
... and the creatures that live in them.


409
0:45:51,601 --> 0:45:55,269
Dolphin meat is later sold in
markets and restaurants,


410
0:45:55,269 --> 0:46:1,517
though often mislabeled as "whale meat".


411
0:46:1,517 --> 0:46:6,879
But as though cruelty toward animals
raised for food wasn't enough,


412
0:46:6,879 --> 0:46:11,377
we've also found ways of making
use of them for all our clothes.


413
0:46:11,377 --> 0:46:17,265
Jackets, shoes, belts, gloves,
pants, wallets, purses, and so on,


414
0:46:17,265 --> 0:46:21,863
the next question is obviously:
where do our clothes come from?


415
0:46:21,863 --> 0:46:36,282
PART TREE: CLOTHES


416
0:46:36,282 --> 0:46:36,843
(LEATHER)


417
0:46:36,843 --> 0:46:42,372
The demand for leather comes primarily from
the United States, Germany, and the U.K.


418
0:46:42,372 --> 0:46:45,321
Just about everybody wears it,


419
0:46:45,321 --> 0:46:48,611
with little or no thought of
where it came from.


420
0:46:48,611 --> 0:46:49,976
(INDIA COWS)


421
0:46:49,976 --> 0:46:53,436
Thousands of India cows are
slaughtered each week for their skins,


422
0:46:53,436 --> 0:46:57,102
purchased from poor families
in part of rural India who sell them


423
0:46:57,102 --> 0:47:2,474
only after the assurance that the
animals will live out their lives on farms.


424
0:47:2,474 --> 0:47:13,183
SHOEING AND ROPING


425
0:47:13,183 --> 0:47:15,955
To relocate the animals to
a state where they can legally be killed,


426
0:47:15,955 --> 0:47:19,333
since cattle slaughter
is forbidden in most of India,


427
0:47:19,333 --> 0:47:24,406
the animals must be shoed and roped together
in preparation for a harrowing "death march",


428
0:47:24,406 --> 0:47:34,849
which could last for several days.


429
0:47:34,849 --> 0:47:36,343
(TRANSPORTATION AND FATIGUE)


430
0:47:36,343 --> 0:47:40,661
Forced to walk through the heat and dust without
food or water, coupled with the sheer stress of


431
0:47:40,661 --> 0:47:48,8
this terrifying experience for them, many of
the animals collapse and are unable to continue.


432
0:47:48,8 --> 0:47:53,22
Bear in mind that most of the cattle are
being placed in a truck for the first time in


433
0:47:53,22 --> 0:47:55,407
their lives and are likely to be frightened,


434
0:47:55,407 --> 0:47:59,928
especially if they have been handled hastily
or roughly by the men loading the trucks.


435
0:47:59,928 --> 0:48:1,528
The noise and motion of the truck itself


436
0:48:1,528 --> 0:48:5,233
is also a new experience;
one which makes them ill.


437
0:48:5,233 --> 0:48:10,52
After one or two days inside the truck without
food or water, they are desperately thirsty


438
0:48:10,52 --> 0:48:15,369
and hungry, especially since it is normal for
such cows to eat frequently throughout the day.


439
0:48:15,369 --> 0:48:24,73
TAIL BREAKING


440
0:48:24,73 --> 0:48:29,362
But when the cattle become weary and grow
faint, the bones in their tales are broken in


441
0:48:29,362 --> 0:48:34,268
an effort to get them back up on their feet.


442
0:48:34,268 --> 0:48:39,382
This is done by repeatedly pinching the
tail in several areas.


443
0:48:39,382 --> 0:48:48,164
HANDLERS


444
0:48:48,164 --> 0:48:51,493
Handlers must constantly
keep the cattle moving,


445
0:48:51,493 --> 0:48:53,506
pulling them by nose ropes,


446
0:48:53,506 --> 0:48:55,348
twisting their necks,


447
0:48:55,348 --> 0:48:59,944
horns, or tails.


448
0:48:59,944 --> 0:49:1,481
They lead, or rather force,


449
0:49:1,481 --> 0:49:5,878
the cattle down embankments and
in and out of trucks without ramps,


450
0:49:5,878 --> 0:49:18,972
causing injuries like
broken pelvises, legs, ribs, and horns.


451
0:49:18,972 --> 0:49:21,712
CHILI PEPPER


452
0:49:21,712 --> 0:49:26,702
Chili pepper and tobacco are also used
to keep the animals walking.


453
0:49:26,702 --> 0:49:32,216
This practice is done by rubbing the pepper
directly into their eyes, in order to stimulate


454
0:49:32,216 --> 0:49:39,73
the animal back onto his or her feet.


455
0:49:39,73 --> 0:49:49,35
SLAUGHTER


456
0:49:49,35 --> 0:49:53,786
And all this before the slaughter.


457
0:49:53,786 --> 0:49:57,545
As many as half of the animals will
already be dead by the time they


458
0:49:57,545 --> 0:50:17,573
arrive at the slaughterhouse.


459
0:50:17,573 --> 0:50:22,916
But to make the experience even more
traumatic and terrifying, they are


460
0:50:22,916 --> 0:50:25,88
often killed in full view of each other.


461
0:50:25,88 --> 0:50:30,72
And instead of the required "quick slice"
across the throat with a sharp knife,


462
0:50:30,72 --> 0:50:50,301
they are generally killed through
hacking and sawing with a dull blade.


463
0:50:50,301 --> 0:50:55,363
TANNING


464
0:50:55,363 --> 0:51:0,384
Afterwards, the skins from these animals
are sent to tanneries that use deadly


465
0:51:0,384 --> 0:51:5,836
substances like Chromium and other toxins
to stop decomposition.


466
0:51:5,836 --> 0:51:10,85
Remember, leather is dead flesh.


467
0:51:10,85 --> 0:51:16,443
It is dead skin, and, therefore, natural for
it to decompose and rot away unless treated


468
0:51:16,443 --> 0:51:20,95
with such potent substances as these.


469
0:51:20,95 --> 0:51:25,484
And for people, the health effects of
such chemicals in tanneries, in lieu of the


470
0:51:25,484 --> 0:51:30,972
continued demand for leather goods, is
yet another issue.


471
0:51:30,972 --> 0:51:37,768
RETAIL


472
0:51:37,768 --> 0:51:42,222
Ultimately, leather from Indian cattle
make their way to clothing stores


473
0:51:42,222 --> 0:51:55,669
all around the world.


474
0:51:55,669 --> 0:52:0,33
Most major chains sell Indian leather ...


475
0:52:0,33 --> 0:52:6,883
... leather that comes from completely
different cows than those we eat.


476
0:52:6,883 --> 0:52:9,794
FUR


477
0:52:9,794 --> 0:52:11,718
And what about fur?


478
0:52:11,718 --> 0:52:14,664
Over 100 million wild
animals are murdered


479
0:52:14,664 --> 0:52:19,733
for their pelts every year, 25
million in the United States alone.


480
0:52:19,733 --> 0:52:25,386
These animals, obtained by hunting and trapping,
are kept on fur farms in conditions like these.


481
0:52:25,386 --> 0:52:29,902
CAGE MADNESS


482
0:52:29,902 --> 0:52:36,896
Naturally, these undomesticated, wild animals
are not accustomed to being caged,


483
0:52:36,896 --> 0:52:41,555
and cage madness develops when frightened
and frustrated animals are driven crazy


484
0:52:41,555 --> 0:52:46,529
from the stress of confinement.


485
0:52:46,529 --> 0:52:48,442
These wild, free-roaming animals,


486
0:52:48,442 --> 0:52:52,879
and their offspring, find themselves
unable to live a natural life,


487
0:52:52,879 --> 0:52:59,53
can never take even a few steps
or feel the earth beneath their feet.


488
0:52:59,53 --> 0:53:4,251
Instead, they are reduced to
scratching, circling and pacing endlessly.


489
0:53:4,251 --> 0:53:6,298
(INJURIES AND SLOW DEATH)


490
0:53:6,298 --> 0:53:9,639
The physical injuries these
animals endure on fur farms ...


491
0:53:9,639 --> 0:53:16,717
involve broken and exposed bones ...


492
0:53:16,717 --> 0:53:21,243
... blindness ...


493
0:53:21,243 --> 0:53:23,71
... ear infections ...


494
0:53:23,71 --> 0:53:25,569
... dehydration and malnutrition ...


495
0:53:25,569 --> 0:53:29,314
... exposure to freezing temperatures ...


496
0:53:29,314 --> 0:53:32,718
... lack of veterinary care ...


497
0:53:32,718 --> 0:53:42,473
... and slow death.


498
0:53:42,473 --> 0:53:44,46
(KILLING)


499
0:53:44,46 --> 0:53:47,147
No laws indicate the killing of
animals on fur farms, therefore,


500
0:53:47,147 --> 0:53:51,483
the least expensive methods
are the most appealing.


501
0:53:51,483 --> 0:53:56,403
Carbon monoxide poisoning,
Strychnine, suffocation,


502
0:53:56,403 --> 0:54:3,291
breaking the neck, and anal electrocution
are some of the more common methods used.


503
0:54:3,291 --> 0:54:9,392
Removed from his or her cage with a heavy
neck-pole, the animal is walked past


504
0:54:9,392 --> 0:54:17,661
the rows of bodies of slaughtered foxes,
sables, raccoons and wolves, among others.


505
0:54:17,661 --> 0:54:22,459
Death by anal electrocution is a crude
process that requires a probe to be inserted


506
0:54:22,459 --> 0:54:34,809
in the rectum while the animal
bites down on a metal conductor.


507
0:54:34,809 --> 0:54:53,4
Often times this inept procedure must
be repeated to actually kill the animal.


508
0:54:53,4 --> 0:55:2,1
And the skinned carcasses seen here will later
be ground up and fed to the animals still caged.


509
0:55:2,1 --> 0:55:34,404
CHINESE FUR FARM


510
0:55:34,404 --> 0:56:28,989
CANADIAN SEAL HUNT


511
0:56:28,989 --> 0:56:31,38
- How much is this one?


512
0:56:31,38 --> 0:56:36,623
- This is... $49,500


513
0:56:36,623 --> 0:56:39,368
PART FOUR: ENTERTAINMENT


514
0:56:39,368 --> 0:56:44,856
And so we move on to entertainment.


515
0:56:44,856 --> 0:56:47,21
Mark Twain once said,


516
0:56:47,21 --> 0:56:53,59
"Of all the creatures ever made
he (man) is the most detestable.


517
0:56:53,59 --> 0:57:2,902
He's the only creature that inflicts
pain for sport, knowing it to be pain".


518
0:57:2,902 --> 0:57:5,614
RODEOS


519
0:57:5,614 --> 0:57:11,914
In rodeos, bulls and broncos don't buck because
they're wild, but because they're in pain.


520
0:57:11,914 --> 0:57:14,714
A belt, called a flank strap or a
bucking strap, is secured around


521
0:57:14,714 --> 0:57:18,446
the animal's body over the genital area.


522
0:57:18,446 --> 0:57:21,954
As the animal leaves the chute, a tight
jerk on the belt is enough


523
0:57:21,954 --> 0:57:28,271
to start him bucking in pain.


524
0:57:28,271 --> 0:57:32,797
Apart from other injuries animals
incur at rodeos ...


525
0:57:32,797 --> 0:57:37,508
... such as broken legs ...


526
0:57:37,508 --> 0:57:41,238
... they are also worked up by being slapped ...


527
0:57:41,238 --> 0:57:42,837
... teased ...


528
0:57:42,837 --> 0:57:45,43
... given electric prods ...


529
0:57:45,43 --> 0:57:47,295
... and otherwise tormented ...


530
0:57:47,295 --> 0:58:35,836
... to bolt out of the chute in a frenzy.


531
0:58:35,836 --> 0:58:44,996
ROPING


532
0:58:44,996 --> 0:58:50,616
Roping, as seen here, involves throwing a rope
around the neck of a frightened animal running


533
0:58:50,616 --> 0:59:9,379
full speed, jerking the poor creature to
a halt, and slamming him or her to the ground.


534
0:59:9,379 --> 0:59:11,912
GAMBLING


535
0:59:11,912 --> 0:59:14,29
Like any other business, dog racing
and horse racing are industries motivated


536
0:59:14,29 --> 0:59:17,22
by a common denominator:


537
0:59:17,22 --> 0:59:28,825
profit.


538
0:59:28,825 --> 0:59:30,929
FAIR GROUNDS


539
0:59:30,929 --> 0:59:36,18
At fair grounds across the country,
animals are used to race,


540
0:59:36,18 --> 0:59:40,442
bet with, and spectate over.


541
0:59:40,442 --> 0:59:45,967
Training for these events is accomplished
by withholding food and sometimes water.


542
0:59:45,967 --> 0:59:50,653
These animals ... unfamiliar with their
surroundings ... the noise ... the crowds ...


543
0:59:50,653 --> 1:0:0,25
even what they're supposed to be doing ...
are all-too-often injured and discarded ...


544
1:0:0,25 --> 1:0:7,34
(PIGEON BOWLING)
in pointless ... trivial ... outlandish contests
... designed to make profits and entertain.


545
1:0:7,34 --> 1:0:11,173
HUNTING


546
1:0:11,173 --> 1:0:17,414
Besides loss of habitat, hunting
is the number one threat to wildlife today.


547
1:0:17,414 --> 1:0:21,957
Hunters kill over 200 million
animals every year.


548
1:0:21,957 --> 1:0:29,4
Deer, rabbits, and squirrels top the list of
desirable targets.


549
1:0:29,4 --> 1:0:34,726
There is no denying it, if hunting is a
sport it is a bloodsport.


550
1:0:34,726 --> 1:0:37,505
The targets are living,


551
1:0:37,505 --> 1:0:51,513
and they undergo violent deaths.


552
1:0:51,513 --> 1:0:53,807
FISHING


553
1:0:53,807 --> 1:1:1,338
Fishing is also a death sport,
wherein the nonhuman animal suffers.


554
1:1:1,338 --> 1:1:8,636
Researchers have distinguished that fish show
pain behavior the same way mammals do.


555
1:1:8,636 --> 1:1:12,905
Anatomically, physiologically,


556
1:1:12,905 --> 1:1:18,182
and biologically, the pain system in fish is
virtually the same as in birds and mammals.


557
1:1:18,182 --> 1:1:21,34
In other words, fish are sentient organisms,


558
1:1:21,34 --> 1:1:32,601
so of course they feel pain.


559
1:1:32,601 --> 1:1:35,589
For those who think fish die


560
1:1:35,589 --> 1:1:39,742
"gentler" deaths, consider that their
sensory organs are highly developed,


561
1:1:39,742 --> 1:1:45,392
their nervous systems complex,
their nerve cells very similar to our own,


562
1:1:45,392 --> 1:1:52,537
and their responses to certain stimuli
immediate and vigorous.


563
1:1:52,537 --> 1:1:58,745
CIRCUSES


564
1:1:58,745 --> 1:2:4,378
When going to the circus, rarely do
we stop for a moment and consider:


565
1:2:4,378 --> 1:2:9,967
What incites an animal to do something unnatural,
even dangerous, such as jumping through


566
1:2:9,967 --> 1:2:27,401
flames, balancing on one foot, or diving into
water from shaky platforms high in the air?


567
1:2:27,401 --> 1:2:30,667
Animal trainers would
like for the public to


568
1:2:30,667 --> 1:2:39,338
believe that animals are coaxed into such
behaviors with the promise of rewards.


569
1:2:39,338 --> 1:2:56,975
But the truth is that animals
perform because they fear punishment.


570
1:2:56,975 --> 1:3:1,302
In essence, circuses condemn animal


571
1:3:1,302 --> 1:3:6,338
who are wild by nature to live out their
days isolated in tiny, barren cages,


572
1:3:6,338 --> 1:3:13,826
denied normal exercise and socialization,


573
1:3:13,826 --> 1:3:18,631
shuttled around from place to place,


574
1:3:18,631 --> 1:3:24,896
WINTER QUARTERS


575
1:3:24,896 --> 1:3:32,147
and shackled in chains
for up to 95% of their lives.


576
1:3:32,147 --> 1:3:36,445
TRAINING


577
1:3:36,445 --> 1:3:41,411
"Elephants are taught to perform with
positive reinforcement, and never hit".


578
1:3:41,411 --> 1:3:47,175
"Never hit. Never, never, never


579
1:3:47,175 --> 1:4:9,837
will you see anyone use the ankus as
anything other than a guide or a tool".


580
1:4:9,837 --> 1:4:45,934
Dominance, subservience, and pain
are integral parts of the training process.


581
1:4:45,934 --> 1:4:48,344
- Hurt him. Don't touch him!


582
1:4:48,344 --> 1:4:49,769
Make him scream!


583
1:4:49,769 --> 1:4:54,42
If you're scared to hurt him,
don't come in this room.


584
1:4:54,42 --> 1:4:58,316
When I say rip his fuckin' ---
you know how I am about touchin' him, right?


585
1:4:58,316 --> 1:5:2,585
So if I say rip his head off ...
rip his fuckin' foot off, what does that mean?


586
1:5:2,585 --> 1:5:5,694
Because it's very important to do it, right?
When he starts squirming too fuckin' much -


587
1:5:5,694 --> 1:5:9,428
both fuckin' hands - BOOM!
Right under that chin!


588
1:5:9,428 --> 1:5:11,723
Sit ... and he better back up.


589
1:5:11,723 --> 1:5:14,189
Then when he fucks around too much,
don't grab that leg ...


590
1:5:14,189 --> 1:5:19,776
... you fuckin' sink that hook and give everything
you've got ... and when it's in there go, ee-eeee-ee!!!


591
1:5:19,776 --> 1:5:21,908
And he's gonna start screaming.


592
1:5:21,908 --> 1:5:27,679
When you hear that screaming, then you know
you've got their attention a little fuckin' bit!


593
1:5:27,679 --> 1:5:31,598
Right here in the barn.
Can't do it on the road.


594
1:5:31,598 --> 1:5:36,151
She's gonna fuckin' do what I want.
And that's just the fuckin' way it is.


595
1:5:36,151 --> 1:5:38,459
Alright, let's go.


596
1:5:38,459 --> 1:5:43,313
Becky! Becky!!!


597
1:5:43,313 --> 1:5:46,411
You motherfucker.


598
1:5:46,411 --> 1:5:50,275
Get your motherfuckin' --- get up here!


599
1:5:50,275 --> 1:5:53,156
Motherfucker!


600
1:5:53,156 --> 1:5:56,402
Come here, Becky.


601
1:5:56,402 --> 1:5:59,119
Move up, Becky.


602
1:5:59,119 --> 1:6:3,658
Move up, Becky.


603
1:6:3,658 --> 1:6:5,497
Alright, tubs.


604
1:6:5,497 --> 1:6:9,831
Tubs!


605
1:6:9,831 --> 1:6:11,499
Hey, get loony.


606
1:6:11,499 --> 1:6:13,156
Hey, Becky.
Go on, move up.


607
1:6:13,156 --> 1:6:14,46
Hey, I'm alive.


608
1:6:14,46 --> 1:6:15,836
I'm not a dead man.


609
1:6:15,836 --> 1:6:17,61
Move up.


610
1:6:17,61 --> 1:6:18,632
Come in line.


611
1:6:18,632 --> 1:6:20,859
Come in line, Becky.


612
1:6:20,859 --> 1:6:22,113
Motherfucker!


613
1:6:22,113 --> 1:6:27,982
Move, motherfucker!


614
1:6:27,982 --> 1:6:31,957
Yeah, come in line. Come here, Tommy.


615
1:6:31,957 --> 1:6:41,227
Why do they have to go through that because
you motherfuckers don't want to listen?


616
1:6:41,227 --> 1:6:42,847
Back up.


617
1:6:42,847 --> 1:6:55,988
You got a pussy-ass fuckin' attitude,
it's just the way they die.


618
1:6:55,988 --> 1:7:1,916
We know animals feel.


619
1:7:1,916 --> 1:7:8,377
They feel fear, loneliness, and
pain, just like humans do.


620
1:7:8,377 --> 1:7:12,562
What animal would choose to
spend their entire life in captivity ...


621
1:7:12,562 --> 1:7:15,103
... if they had a choice?


622
1:7:15,103 --> 1:8:32,282
RETALIATION


623
1:8:32,282 --> 1:8:34,178
- On the count of three.


624
1:8:34,178 --> 1:8:35,94
One.


625
1:8:35,94 --> 1:8:37,195
Two.


626
1:8:37,195 --> 1:8:38,391
Tree.


627
1:8:38,391 --> 1:9:7,65
Take him.
You've got to shoot.


628
1:9:7,65 --> 1:9:11,633
ZOOS


629
1:9:11,633 --> 1:9:17,412
Are zoos valuable educational
and conservation institutions?


630
1:9:17,412 --> 1:9:21,483
Sure, zoos are interesting, but they are
only educational in the sense that they


631
1:9:21,483 --> 1:9:28,51
teach a disregard for the
natures of other living beings.


632
1:9:28,51 --> 1:9:36,658
Besides, what can we learn about
wild animals by viewing them in captivity?


633
1:9:36,658 --> 1:9:41,876
Zoos exist because we
are intrigued by exotic things,


634
1:9:41,876 --> 1:9:49,615
and to zoo-goers,
zoo animals are just that: things.


635
1:9:49,615 --> 1:9:53,774
In both cases, at circuses or zoos,


636
1:9:53,774 --> 1:9:57,658
wild and exotic animals
are captured, caged,


637
1:9:57,658 --> 1:10:6,874
transported and trained ... to
do what humans want them to do.


638
1:10:6,874 --> 1:10:9,898
BULLFIGHTING


639
1:10:9,898 --> 1:10:13,743
At best, the term "bullfighting"
is a misnomer,


640
1:10:13,743 --> 1:10:17,638
as there is little competition
between the sword of a nimble matador


641
1:10:17,638 --> 1:10:20,46
(which is Spanish for killer),


642
1:10:20,46 --> 1:10:29,309
and a confused, maimed, psychologically
tormented, and physically debilitated bull.


643
1:10:29,309 --> 1:10:32,641
Many prominent former
bullfighters report


644
1:10:32,641 --> 1:10:36,95
that bulls are intentionally debilitated
with tranquilizers and laxatives,


645
1:10:36,95 --> 1:10:46,363
beatings to the kidneys, and heavy weights hung
around their necks for weeks before a fight.


646
1:10:46,363 --> 1:10:52,457
Some of the animals are placed in darkness
for 48 hours before the confrontation,


647
1:10:52,457 --> 1:10:58,666
then are released
blinded into the bright arena.


648
1:10:58,666 --> 1:11:3,943
In a typical event, the bull enters and
is approached by men who exhaust and


649
1:11:3,943 --> 1:11:10,693
frustrate him by running him in
circles and tricking him into collisions.


650
1:11:10,693 --> 1:11:13,455
When the bull is tired and out of breath,


651
1:11:13,455 --> 1:11:19,288
he is approached by picadors, who
drive lances into his back and neck muscles,


652
1:11:19,288 --> 1:11:23,44
twisting and gouging to ensure
a significant amount of blood loss,


653
1:11:23,44 --> 1:11:28,666
and impairing the bull's
ability to lift his head.


654
1:11:28,666 --> 1:11:31,387
Then come the banderilleros


655
1:11:31,387 --> 1:11:38,243
who distract and dart around the bull
while plunging more lances into him.


656
1:11:38,243 --> 1:11:41,0
Weakened from blood loss,


657
1:11:41,0 --> 1:11:46,37
they run the bull in more circles
until he is dizzy and stops chasing.


658
1:11:46,37 --> 1:11:51,935
Finally, the matador, this "killer",
appears and, after provoking a few exhausted


659
1:11:51,935 --> 1:12:0,133
charges from the dying animal,
tries to kill the bull with his sword.


660
1:12:0,133 --> 1:12:6,712
And this bloody form of amusement ...
is bullfighting.


661
1:12:6,712 --> 1:12:11,123
The pleasure derived from all these
activities and sports


662
1:12:11,123 --> 1:12:14,236
(a communion with nature, some would say),


663
1:12:14,236 --> 1:12:19,152
can be secured without
harming or killing animals.


664
1:12:19,152 --> 1:12:23,446
The commercial exploitation of wildlife
erroneously assumes that the value of wild


665
1:12:23,446 --> 1:12:28,209
animals is reducible to their
utility relative to human interests,


666
1:12:28,209 --> 1:12:32,79
especially economic interests.


667
1:12:32,79 --> 1:12:43,1
But wild animals are not a renewable resource,
having value only relative to human interests.


668
1:12:43,1 --> 1:12:52,97
That perception
can only be that of a speciesist.


669
1:12:52,97 --> 1:12:55,758
(SEAL HARVEST, ST. PAUL ISLAND)
Nevertheless, these practices exist


670
1:12:55,758 --> 1:13:5,936
only because we do not take
seriously the interests of other animals.


671
1:13:5,936 --> 1:13:13,744
In this light, are humans not
the most callous speciesists of all?


672
1:13:13,744 --> 1:13:21,348
PART FIVE: SCIENCE


673
1:13:21,348 --> 1:13:23,798
VIVISECTION


674
1:13:23,798 --> 1:13:27,607
The term vivisection is used
to apply to all types of experiments


675
1:13:27,607 --> 1:13:34,182
on living animals and is said to be
a form of medical science.


676
1:13:34,182 --> 1:13:36,522
The reason for experimentation of this


677
1:13:36,522 --> 1:13:44,21
type is to allegedly discover cures
for human ailments and illnesses.


678
1:13:44,21 --> 1:13:48,96
But those who hope to find remedies
for human ills by inflicting deliberate


679
1:13:48,96 --> 1:13:53,633
sufferings on animals commit
two fundamental errors in understanding.


680
1:13:53,633 --> 1:13:55,43
The first is the assumption


681
1:13:55,43 --> 1:14:0,176
that results obtained on animals
are applicable to mankind.


682
1:14:0,176 --> 1:14:2,323
The second concerns the inevitable


683
1:14:2,323 --> 1:14:8,126
fallacy of experimental science in
respect to the field of organic life.


684
1:14:8,126 --> 1:14:12,673
Since animals react differently
from human beings ... every new product


685
1:14:12,673 --> 1:14:15,401
or method tried out on animals must be tried


686
1:14:15,401 --> 1:14:23,318
out again on man ... through careful clinical
tests, before it can be considered safe.


687
1:14:23,318 --> 1:14:26,387
This rule knows no exceptions.


688
1:14:26,387 --> 1:14:31,624
Tests on animals are not only dangerous
because they lead to wrong conclusions


689
1:14:31,624 --> 1:14:35,802
but, furthermore,
they retard clinical investigation -


690
1:14:35,802 --> 1:14:39,639
which is the only valid kind.


691
1:14:39,639 --> 1:14:42,143
Just remember the fact that any disease


692
1:14:42,143 --> 1:14:48,492
deliberately provoked is unlike any
disease that arises spontaneously.


693
1:14:48,492 --> 1:14:51,775
MEDICAL EXPERIMENTS


694
1:14:51,775 --> 1:14:54,99
Unfortunately, such
methods still sail today


695
1:14:54,99 --> 1:14:56,776
under the flag of science


696
1:14:56,776 --> 1:15:14,781
- which is an insult to true science,
as well as human intelligence.


697
1:15:14,781 --> 1:15:20,365
And so vivisection applies to medical
experiments ...


698
1:15:20,365 --> 1:15:29,474
... done with the administration of noxious
substances ...


699
1:15:29,474 --> 1:15:43,352
... electric or traumatic shocks ...


700
1:15:43,352 --> 1:15:56,16
... unanesthetized operations ...


701
1:15:56,16 --> 1:16:28,799
... burns ...


702
1:16:28,799 --> 1:16:35,247
... drawn-out deprivations of food and drink ...


703
1:16:35,247 --> 1:16:38,237
... physical and psychological tortures ...


704
1:16:38,237 --> 1:16:40,67
... that lead to mental imbalance ...


705
1:16:40,67 --> 1:16:44,533
... infections ... and so on.


706
1:16:44,533 --> 1:16:48,465
(UNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA)
Head injury research involves partially


707
1:16:48,465 --> 1:16:52,11
or fully conscious baboons
strapped down with restraints ...


708
1:16:52,11 --> 1:16:54,803
... and their heads
cemented into a metal helmet,


709
1:16:54,803 --> 1:17:28,926
which will be thrust at a 60
degree angle at a force of up to 1,000 Gs.


710
1:17:28,926 --> 1:17:33,334
The purpose of this experiment
is to simulate auto crashes ...


711
1:17:33,334 --> 1:17:38,513
... football ... boxing ...
and other head related injuries.


712
1:17:38,513 --> 1:17:45,143
And this process is often repeated
again and again on the same animals.


713
1:17:45,143 --> 1:17:46,672
MILITARY RESEARCH


714
1:17:46,672 --> 1:17:50,379
And finally, military research.


715
1:17:50,379 --> 1:17:54,393
This one speaks for itself.


716
1:17:54,393 --> 1:17:58,545
>From sending monkeys into outer space,


717
1:17:58,545 --> 1:18:2,797
and testing atomic blasts on helpless dogs,


718
1:18:2,797 --> 1:18:8,951
to exposing primates to nuclear radiation.


719
1:18:8,951 --> 1:18:11,139
Twenty years ago, the number of animals


720
1:18:11,139 --> 1:18:15,779
dying of tortures through the practice
of vivisection was astronomical,


721
1:18:15,779 --> 1:18:19,728
estimated at 400,000 per day world wide,


722
1:18:19,728 --> 1:18:24,54
and growing at an annual rate of five percent.


723
1:18:24,54 --> 1:18:26,15
Today that number is almost


724
1:18:26,15 --> 1:18:39,352
beyond comprehension. 19,000
per minute. 10 billion per year.


725
1:18:39,352 --> 1:18:41,649
Some uneducated persons pretend to


726
1:18:41,649 --> 1:18:48,538
know that less intelligent animals
don't feel pain the same way we do.


727
1:18:48,538 --> 1:18:54,733
In truth, we know very little about how
specific animals may "feel",


728
1:18:54,733 --> 1:18:59,707
except that they must also submit to
the universal law that causes every


729
1:18:59,707 --> 1:19:9,5
organism dying by unnatural means to
suffer greatly before that final release.


730
1:19:9,5 --> 1:19:11,439
But it's nonsense to
say that the animals


731
1:19:11,439 --> 1:19:19,166
do not suffer because they have
a lower order of intelligence.


732
1:19:19,166 --> 1:19:21,817
FORCE-FEEDING GEESE
"FOIE GRAS"


733
1:19:21,817 --> 1:19:26,172
Pain is pain,
conveyed by nerves to the brain,


734
1:19:26,172 --> 1:19:30,476
and there are other nerves
than those of intelligence...


735
1:19:30,476 --> 1:19:36,694
...nerves such as sight,
smell, touch, and hearing.


736
1:19:36,694 --> 1:19:46,484
And in some animals these nerves
are much more highly developed than in man.


737
1:19:46,484 --> 1:19:49,154
We know that there
has never been an epoch


738
1:19:49,154 --> 1:19:55,917
in which we could learn something about
the physiology of man by torturing animals;


739
1:19:55,917 --> 1:19:59,118
we only learned
something about animals.


740
1:19:59,118 --> 1:20:3,492
And if there is something we can learn
from them on the psychological level,


741
1:20:3,492 --> 1:20:9,841
it is not by means of steel or electricity,
much less so through psychic violences.


742
1:20:9,841 --> 1:20:14,838
The systematic torture of sentient beings,


743
1:20:14,838 --> 1:20:19,365
whatever the pretext and in whatever form,
cannot achieve anything more than it already has:


744
1:20:19,365 --> 1:20:32,262
to show us what is the
lowest point of debasement man can reach.


745
1:20:32,262 --> 1:20:36,258
If that's what
we want to know.


746
1:20:36,258 --> 1:20:44,556
"As long as there are slaughterhouses,
there will be battlefields".


747
1:20:44,556 --> 1:21:2,707
- Leo Tolstoy


748
1:21:2,707 --> 1:21:7,66
Ignorance is the speciesist's
first line of defense.


749
1:21:7,66 --> 1:21:14,194
Yet it is easily breached by anyone with the
time and determination to find out the truth.


750
1:21:14,194 --> 1:21:22,576
Ignorance has prevailed so long only because
people do not want to find out the truth.


751
1:21:22,576 --> 1:21:25,173
"Don't tell me, you'll spoil my dinner"


752
1:21:25,173 --> 1:21:31,61
is the usual reply to any attempt to tell
someone just how that dinner was produced.


753
1:21:31,61 --> 1:21:33,6
Even people who are aware that


754
1:21:33,6 --> 1:21:39,451
the traditional family farm has been
taken over by big business interests...


755
1:21:39,451 --> 1:21:44,484
...that their clothes come from slaughtered
cows, that their entertainment means the


756
1:21:44,484 --> 1:21:48,733
suffering and death of millions of
animals... and that some questionable


757
1:21:48,733 --> 1:21:51,126
experiments go on in laboratories,


758
1:21:51,126 --> 1:21:56,943
still cling to a vague belief
that conditions cannot be too bad,


759
1:21:56,943 --> 1:22:1,524
(PREGNAT MARE URINE AKA: "PREMARIN")


760
1:22:1,524 --> 1:22:4,305
or else the government or the animal welfare
societies would have done something about it.


761
1:22:4,305 --> 1:22:11,27
But it is not the inability to find out what
is going on as much as a desire not to know about


762
1:22:11,27 --> 1:22:18,48
facts that may lie heavy on one's conscience
that is responsible for this lack of awareness -


763
1:22:18,48 --> 1:22:24,993
- after all, the victims of whatever it is that goes on in
all these awful places


764
1:22:24,993 --> 1:22:34,683
are not members of one's own group.


765
1:22:34,683 --> 1:22:38,45
It all comes down to pain and suffering.


766
1:22:38,45 --> 1:22:44,56
Not intelligence, not strength,
not social class or civil right.


767
1:22:44,56 --> 1:22:48,759
Pain and suffering are in themselves bad
and should be prevented or minimized,


768
1:22:48,759 --> 1:22:57,881
irrespective of the race, sex,
or species of the being that suffers.


769
1:22:57,881 --> 1:23:2,114
We are all creatures.


770
1:23:2,114 --> 1:23:6,789
And non-human animals experience
sensations just like we do.


771
1:23:6,789 --> 1:23:13,345
They too are strong, intelligent,
industrious, mobile, and evolutional.


772
1:23:13,345 --> 1:23:16,49
They too are capable of
growth and adaptation.


773
1:23:16,49 --> 1:23:21,2
Like us, first and foremost,
they are earthlings.


774
1:23:21,2 --> 1:23:26,151
And like us, they are surviving.


775
1:23:26,151 --> 1:23:30,719
Like us, they also seek their own comfort
rather than discomfort.


776
1:23:30,719 --> 1:23:36,682
And like us, they express degrees
of emotion.


777
1:23:36,682 --> 1:23:41,4
In short, like us, they are alive;


778
1:23:41,4 --> 1:24:5,219
most of them being, in fact,
vertebrae, just like us.


779
1:24:5,219 --> 1:24:10,487
As we look back on how essential
animals are to human survival;


780
1:24:10,487 --> 1:24:14,41
our absolute dependence on them


781
1:24:14,41 --> 1:24:15,79
(for companionship ... food ...


782
1:24:15,79 --> 1:24:17,513
... clothing ...


783
1:24:17,513 --> 1:24:20,8
... sport and entertainment ...


784
1:24:20,8 --> 1:24:24,342
... as well as medical and scientific research),


785
1:24:24,342 --> 1:24:32,631
ironically ... we only see mankind's complete
disrespect for these non-human providers.


786
1:24:32,631 --> 1:24:36,216
Without a doubt, this must be what it is...


787
1:24:36,216 --> 1:24:41,879
... to "bite the hand that feeds us".


788
1:24:41,879 --> 1:24:49,316
In fact, we have actually stomped
and spit on it.


789
1:24:49,316 --> 1:24:52,881
Now we are faced
with the inevitable aftermath.


790
1:24:52,881 --> 1:24:58,27
This is evident in health reports due to
our over-excessive consumption of animals.


791
1:24:58,27 --> 1:24:59,298
Cancer,


792
1:24:59,298 --> 1:25:0,734
heart disease,


793
1:25:0,734 --> 1:25:2,381
Osteoporosis,


794
1:25:2,381 --> 1:25:3,701
strokes,


795
1:25:3,701 --> 1:25:5,188
kidney stones,


796
1:25:5,188 --> 1:25:6,801
Anemia,


797
1:25:6,801 --> 1:25:13,39
diabetes, and more.


798
1:25:13,39 --> 1:25:18,918
Even our food has now been effected ...
and at its very source.


799
1:25:18,918 --> 1:25:22,88
With antibiotics used to
promote weight gain in animals


800
1:25:22,88 --> 1:25:27,946
(who can't gain weight under the stressful,
overcrowded living conditions in factory farms);


801
1:25:27,946 --> 1:25:32,636
with the over-use of
pesticides and insecticides;


802
1:25:32,636 --> 1:25:34,81
or artificial hormones


803
1:25:34,81 --> 1:25:39,795
(designed to increase milk
production, litter size and frequency);


804
1:25:39,795 --> 1:25:45,326
with artificial colors,
herbicides, larvicides,


805
1:25:45,326 --> 1:25:53,501
synthetic fertilizers, tranquilizers,
growth and appetite stimulants ...


806
1:25:53,501 --> 1:25:57,369
... it's no wonder that Mad Cow Disease ...
Foot and Mouth Disease ... Pfiesteria ...


807
1:25:57,369 --> 1:26:0,227
and a host of other animal related
abnormalities have been


808
1:26:0,227 --> 1:26:4,825
(POLLUTION)
unleashed on the human public.


809
1:26:4,825 --> 1:26:8,821
Nature is not responsible for these actions.


810
1:26:8,821 --> 1:26:16,459
(DEFORESTATION)
We are.


811
1:26:16,459 --> 1:26:21,644
So a change is inevitable.
Either we make it ourselves,


812
1:26:21,644 --> 1:26:26,204
or we will be forced to
make it by Nature Itself.


813
1:26:26,204 --> 1:26:30,284
The time has come for each of us
to reconsider our eating habits,


814
1:26:30,284 --> 1:26:32,31
our traditions,


815
1:26:32,31 --> 1:26:34,539
our lifestyles and fashions,


816
1:26:34,539 --> 1:26:45,601
and above all,
our way of thinking.


817
1:26:45,601 --> 1:26:48,541
So, if there is any truth
to the age-old saying,


818
1:26:48,541 --> 1:26:54,463
"What goes around, comes around",
then what do they get for their pain?


819
1:26:54,463 --> 1:26:59,161
Do we even give it a second thought?


820
1:26:59,161 --> 1:27:8,53
If what goes around comes around,
what do they get for their pain?


821
1:27:8,53 --> 1:27:11,426
They are earthlings.


822
1:27:11,426 --> 1:27:17,458
They have the right to be here
just as much as humans do.


823
1:27:17,458 --> 1:27:22,616
Perhaps the answer is found
in another age-old saying ...


824
1:27:22,616 --> 1:27:27,267
... and one equally true:


825
1:27:27,267 --> 1:27:36,404
We reap just what we sow.


826
1:27:36,404 --> 1:27:44,81
So of course, animals feel,
and of course they experience pain.


827
1:27:44,81 --> 1:27:49,833
After all, has nature endowed these
wonderful animals with well-springs of sentiment


828
1:27:49,833 --> 1:27:53,287
so that they should not feel ...


829
1:27:53,287 --> 1:28:1,275
... or do animals have nerves
in order to be insensitive?


830
1:28:1,275 --> 1:28:7,346
Reason demands a better answer.


831
1:28:7,346 --> 1:28:14,199
But one thing is absolutely certain:
animals used for food, used for clothing,


832
1:28:14,199 --> 1:28:18,927
used for entertainment,
and in scientific experiments


833
1:28:18,927 --> 1:28:22,639
and all the oppression that is done to them
under the sun


834
1:28:22,639 --> 1:28:26,532
they all die from pain.


835
1:28:26,532 --> 1:28:31,779
Each and every one.


836
1:28:31,779 --> 1:28:33,458
Isn't it enough that animals


837
1:28:33,458 --> 1:28:39,45
the world over live in permanent retreat
from human progress and expansion?


838
1:28:39,45 --> 1:28:46,29
And for many species ...
there is simply nowhere else to go.


839
1:28:46,29 --> 1:28:51,519
It seems the fate of many animals
is either to be unwanted by man ...


840
1:28:51,519 --> 1:28:55,449
... or wanted too much.


841
1:28:55,449 --> 1:29:1,98
We enter as lords of the earth bearing
strange powers of terror and mercy alike ...


842
1:29:1,98 --> 1:29:5,243
But Human beings
should love animals as ...


843
1:29:5,243 --> 1:29:10,492
the knowing love the innocent,
and the strong love the vulnerable.


844
1:29:10,492 --> 1:29:14,253
When we wince at the
suffering of animals,


845
1:29:14,253 --> 1:29:18,885
that feeling speaks well of
us even when we ignore it,


846
1:29:18,885 --> 1:29:24,121
and those who dismiss love for our fellow
creatures as mere sentimentality


847
1:29:24,121 --> 1:29:29,409
overlook a good and
important part of our humanity.


848
1:29:29,409 --> 1:29:35,475
But it takes nothing away from
a human to be kind to an animal.


849
1:29:35,475 --> 1:29:38,3
And it is actually within us


850
1:29:38,3 --> 1:29:45,757
to grant them a happy
life ... and a long one.


851
1:29:45,757 --> 1:29:52,277
On the heath, King Lear asked Gloucester:
"How do you see the world?"


852
1:29:52,277 --> 1:29:56,445
And Gloucester, who is blind, answered:


853
1:29:56,445 --> 1:30:1,576
"I see it feelingly".


854
1:30:1,576 --> 1:30:6,522
I see it feelingly.


855
1:30:6,522 --> 1:30:11,101
Three primary life forces
exist on this planet:


856
1:30:11,101 --> 1:30:13,629
Nature,


857
1:30:13,629 --> 1:30:17,227
Animals


858
1:30:17,227 --> 1:30:23,123
and Humankind.


859
1:30:23,123 --> 1:30:29,55
We are the Earthlings.


860
1:30:29,55 --> 1:30:35,145
Make the connection.
