###48 There's something I wanna tell you.
###53 After I got shot...
###56 ...you wanna know the very first thing that entered my mind...
###59 ...before l blacked out?
###65 Coins.
###69 I'm 8 years old again on a tour of the U.S. Mint.
###73 I'm Iistening to a guide expIain how coins are made.
###77 How they're punched out of sheet metal.
###79 How they're rimmed and beveled.
###82 How they are stamped and cleaned.
###85 And how each and every batch of coins are personalIy examined.
###88 Just in case any have sLipped through with the sIightest imperfection.
###93 That's what popped into my head.
###96 I am a coin in the United states Army.
###100 I was minted in the year 1 980. I've been punched from sheet metal.
###105 I've been stamped and cleaned.
###107 My ridges have been rimmed and beveIed.
###112 But now l have two smalL holes in me.
###116 I'm no longer in perfect condition.
###120 So there's something eIse I wanna telL you.
###122 Right before everything went black...
###125 ...you wanna know the very last thing that entered my mind?
###130 You.
###158 Why not? Because there are a lot of things you'd be doing.
###161 Just like playing tennis.
###164 Wimbledon? I don't know.
###173 Just gonna go. I'm gonna host the thing. Six-thirty.
###177 And you and I could go at 1 0?
###179 -Oh, shit! -Oh, no!
###181 -Oh, no, Randy, no! -I'm sorry.
###183 I'll get it, l'Il get it, I'm on it. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
###186 Okay? I'm on it.
###187 My whole life is in that bag.
###189 I got it. I got it.
###213 You got it.
###222 Dude. I was gonna get that.
###225 I mean, thanks for jumping in.
###227 Yeah, no problem.
###228 But l mean, hey, I'll take it.
###231 Thank you so much!
###234 Who jumps off a 20-foot pier?
###238 Gosh, I'm a mess. You are a lifesaver. I'm Savannah.
###242 -John. -John.
###244 Brave man. This is my life in here, so l owe-- I owe you.
###250 Don't worry about it.
###251 -Nice to meet you. -Nice to meet you.
###253 You all have a good night.
###255 Yeah, thanks. I was in the water for that.
###259 I was seriously getting it for you.
###263 This guy's crazy.
###264 Yeah, no, I swear l'm not. I'm not stalking you. I just gotta get my board.
###268 -Are you staying here? -Yeah, yeah, I'm from around here.
###272 Hey, John, do you want to--? My house is right over there.
###276 We were actually going back right now. Do you want to join us?
###280 We're having a barbecue.
###281 It's okay. I don't want to intrude on y'all. My dad's making dinner.
###284 Okay.
###286 Well, I could at least give you a beer for the walk home.
###293 -Where is it? -Right over there.
###321 -You in the military or something? -Yeah.
###324 Really?
###326 What branch are you in?
###328 Army, SpeciaI Forces.
###330 Oh, Special Forces. That's impressive. That's....
###337 Is that like a Special Forces ring they give you? ls that what it says on it?
###341 It looks nice on you.
###343 Aren't you supposed to be wearing a hat too? Like a French hat, a beret.
###347 -That's what it's called? -Randy.
###349 I'm just joking with him.
###350 You shouIdn't make fun of a guy who can kill you with his bare hands.
###356 Big guy.
###358 Rock them, sock them, let's go.
###360 How about that?
###363 You know, I'm gonna go get a beer.
###365 Soldier. Pleasure.
###373 I'm sorry about him. He thinks he likes me.
###376 Yeah, I think he likes you too.
###378 No, I'm not his type. He just doesn't know it yet.
###387 What?
###390 Come on, I just think you're probably everybody's type.
###394 See what I mean?
###396 Is this who l think it is? Alan, Alan.
###402 Hey, buddy, I want you to meet John. John, this is Alan.
###405 -Alan, nice to meet you. -Say hi.
###407 He's a little bit shy, isn't he?
###409 Hey, where's your dad?
###411 -Over there. -Two steps behind, as usual.
###415 Sorry, he's like a heat-seeking missile every time he sees you.
###419 -Oh, hey, l'm Tim. -John.
###420 Sorry.
###422 Nice to meet you.
###423 Oh, you SpeciaI Forces, huh?
###425 Yes, sir.
###428 You stationed out at Fort Bragg?
###430 No, Germany, actually.
###433 -Oh, you're on leave. -Yes, sir.
###435 I hope you're enjoying yourself.
###438 Yeah, I think I am.
###441 I'm sorry, I didn't mean to interrupt. It's nice to meet you though.
###444 -Nice to meet you too. -Come on, son. Let's go.
###451 Let's go.
###454 Hello. Hello, John.
###455 Hello, Alan.
###461 -Wow, that was really amazing. -Yeah?
###465 He never talks to anybody. Only his family.
###468 He talked to you.
###470 Yeah, but I'm practicaIly his family. I've known him since he was born.
###474 Yeah?
###484 When do you go back?
###486 Two weeks.
###488 It must be scary what you do.
###492 Boring mostly. You know, long stretches of boring.
###495 Occasional flashes of scary.
###498 Full moon tonight.
###504 Do you ever notice how big the moon is when it's rising?
###509 And how little it gets when it's up in the sky.
###513 You know, that's just your perspective.
###515 It doesn't matter where it is in the sky or where you are...
###519 ...if you hold your hand up and close one of your eyes...
###523 ...it's never bigger than your thumb.
###530 Where'd you Iearn that?
###532 I don't know.
###535 Somewhere.
###544 You just made your own fire.
###548 That's very impressive.
###551 Very primal.
###555 But you're still not gonna be abIe to cook that hotdog, I fear.
###558 I fear that as well.
###562 I should probably be getting going anyways.
###564 I'm sorry. I hope you don't get into too much trouble.
###569 I think it's probably too late for that.
###572 Yeah.
###575 Thank you.
###576 Yeah. No, you're welcome.
###583 Would you wanna maybe do this again tomorrow night?
###587 Tomorrow is chicken. I don't think you're gonna wanna try it.
###590 I was kind of hoping maybe we'd let somebody else do the cooking.
###593 Type of thing.
###595 -Okay. -Yeah?
###599 So maybe I'll come by around 6 or something?
###605 -Okay. -All right.
###611 So l'Il see you soon, then?
###613 I'll see you soon, then.
###614 Yeah. Soon.
###627 -Hey. -Hey, man.
###630 We're headed into town for some ice cream. You want a ride?
###633 No, no, no, it's fine. I don't mind walking at aIl. It's fine.
###638 Sure?
###641 -All right. I appreciate it. -Yeah.
###644 Hey, AIan, move on over here.
###646 Here, l'Il undo your belt.
###650 Five, six, seven, eight...
###654 -So how long are you in town for? -...nine.
###656 We Iive here year-round now.
###658 Yeah, we were driving down every weekend anyways...
###661 ...so I finalIy just convinced my wife this just made the most sense.
###666 -She didn't want ice cream? -Who?
###668 Oh, my wife. No.
###672 No, actualIy she's on vacation herself.
###674 White sheep, white sheep, white sheep.
###677 -It's difficult to take trips together. -White sheep.
###681 It's fine. We make it work.
###686 I'm up here on the left.
###697 Hey, John.
###700 For the record, if you do anything to hurt Savannah...
###703 ...l'm gonna have to break something.
###706 Something in your leg. Some-- One of the bones in there.
###711 Okay.
###713 It's just l know her father and he would expect me to say something like that.
###718 It'd just sound a lot more natural coming out of his mouth.
###722 It sounded fine.
###726 -No, it-- -Yes, it did.
###728 -No, it didn't. -It did. It really did.
###730 It didn't. But thank you.
###731 -It reaIly did. -You think so?
###734 Yeah, it did.
###735 Okay.
###738 Hey, don't honk the horn, it's nighttime.
###744 -Good night, John. -Good night, Tim.
###748 -Thanks for the ride. -Yeah, no problem.
###786 Hey, Dad, l'm not gonna be able to stay for dinner.
###791 Well, I made lasagna.
###793 I know you made lasagna. It's Sunday.
###798 Can l borrow the car?
###808 Thanks.
###813 -Best seafood you'll ever have. -Yeah, I know.
###816 -I used to come here aIl the time. -Really?
###818 Are you sure you don't wanna go somewhere, I don't know, nice?
###821 Nice? No, I wanna go somewhere good.
###824 Okay.
###829 What the hell you doing here?
###833 Come on, Steve. It's been three years already.
###837 I don't want any trouble here.
###839 You're not gonna get any. I promise.
###842 All right.
###844 Thank you.
###850 What happened with that guy out there?
###852 -What guy? -What's the story with him?
###854 -No story. -Really?
###856 Yeah.
###857 He's an old buddy of mine.
###862 What?
###871 Your dad get mad at you for coming home late last night?
###874 No. He's not really the type that gets mad.
###879 What kind of guy is he then?
###882 Quiet one?
###885 -Could be worse, I guess. -I guess.
###889 And your mom?
###891 Nope, just me and my dad.
###894 Did he raise you all by himself?
###898 Yeah.
###900 Why do you wanna know about my dad?
###902 Just curious.
###905 Curious about where you come from.
###913 I wanna meet your dad.
###915 Tonight.
###922 Look, you're-- You're not gonna get very much out of him.
###925 So, l don't know, just don't take it personaIly, okay?
###932 Hey, Pop.
###934 I got somebody I want you to meet.
###938 Hey.
###939 -This is Savannah. -Hi.
###942 It's nice to meet you, Mr. Tyree.
###947 He-- This is my-- He collects coins. He-- It's kind of like his big hobby.
###951 This is amazing.
###953 You have so many coins. How did you get started in all this?
###958 Through John, actually.
###961 Not his thing anymore.
###962 -Hey, we shouId probably maybe go. -What is this coin?
###966 That's a Sacagawean mule.
###970 It's actually....
###975 -Do you want to see some more? -Absolutely, yes, if you don't mind.
###980 -Put this glove on then. -Thanks.
###984 This is a humorous one. This is a satirical coin.
###989 This is massive.
###990 Yeah, William Jennings BRYan, when he ran for president...
###993 ...he was-- He believed in-- No, don't turn it over.
###996 Leave it here.
###998 Do you remember that he had the free silver policy. You remember.
###1002 And McKinley was his opponent and he's-- Wait, here.
###1007 Now see, that's a real silver dollar. That's the size of a silver dollar.
###1012 And McKinley said that if Bryan had his way...
###1016 ...then the silver dollars would be that big. Yeah.
###1020 -That's amazing. -Can you imagine...
###1022 ...walking around with that in your pocket?
###1024 -That's really funny. -That's humorous.
###1028 Now, these--
###1030 Pop, we can't do this right now. We can't be here alI night.
###1033 I have-- I have some to show you.
###1036 This is fascinating.
###1037 These are all matched in color.
###1046 I had fun tonight.
###1049 I like your dad.
###1051 You shouIdn't be too hard on him.
###1054 He loves you.
###1055 I can tell even if you can't.
###1063 Whoa, whoa, wait a minute. Wait, Savannah. I mean....
###1067 So l guess l'll see you soon, then?
###1069 I'll see you soon, then.
###1110 Where you been all day?
###1112 -I've been busy. -You're on spring break.
###1116 You're supposed to be lounging on the beach all day.
###1118 You're not supposed to be busy doing things.
###1122 I want to show you something.
###1126 The family that lived here, their home was damaged by the hurricane.
###1130 -What, so now you're rebuilding it? -Yup. WelI, not just me.
###1134 You're starting to make me a littIe nervous.
###1137 Why am I starting to make you nervous?
###1141 Because I'm starting to think you might be too good of a person for me.
###1144 No, I'm not that good of a person.
###1146 You're sneaking off eveRY day to do manual labor on a house for charity.
###1152 -On your spring break. -Yeah, you're right.
###1155 It's selfish, reaIly, me being this generous.
###1159 -You don't drink, you don't smoke. -Nope. Nope.
###1164 -You probably don't sleep around. -Absolutely not.
###1169 Okay, look, you gotta have a fault.
###1171 -I do. -Okay, care to enlighten me?
###1177 I curse.
###1180 -No. -I do.
###1181 -No, you don't. -I do.
###1182 -I haven't heard you. -Well, that's because it's in my mind.
###1187 There's a never-ending stream of curse words...
###1190 ...that l'm thinking at all times.
###1192 Okay, fine, just say one then.
###1194 No, I can't tell you because it's filthy.
###1196 -Right. -Yeah.
###1198 Okay, aIl right. Fair enough.
###1200 No, I have faults, John.
###1202 Trust me, I have plenty of them. You'll see.
###1206 I hope so.
###1210 We have to be finished with this in three weeks.
###1213 Hope that actually happens.
###1214 These are to be the bedrooms, parents' room...
###1217 ...the boys' rooms, two boys, 7 and 9.
###1220 Living room and the bathroom.
###1222 And then this is the kitchen.
###1224 This is the best room because the mom's a really good cook.
###1227 We're gonna make it really beautifuI with white tile floors and tiles...
###1233 ...on the countertops and there's gonna be a roof.
###1237 -Here, John, come here. -A roof would definitely be good.
###1242 It's gonna be like this, but it's gonna be everywhere.
###1245 It's the only cover we have.
###1247 Nice, we're gonna be here for a while.
###1251 Where'd you get your scar?
###1254 That one?
###1259 A knife fight.
###1261 It was five years ago, we were really drunk and the guy went for my eye.
###1266 That's terrible.
###1268 Why? He missed.
###1271 The way people act around you, the way they treated you at that restaurant.
###1276 -It's like they're scared of you. -They're not scared of me.
###1281 They might be scared of who I used to be.
###1283 And who is that?
###1287 Somebody different?
###1289 So when did you change? When you went into the Army?
###1293 Yeah. Yeah, l mean, partly yeah.
###1296 And the other part?
###1299 I don't know, I'm stiIl working on that.
###1303 So you used to be tough.
###1307 And maybe you stiIl are a little bit.
###1310 -You don't scare me, John. -No?
###1315 Well, you scare me.
###1444 Don't worry about him.
###1457 John!
###1468 What, you think you're safe in there? Okay.
###1476 No!
###1504 It's all right. Everybody understands.
###1535 What are you doing over here?
###1538 You're missing the party.
###1540 The party's just managing fine without me.
###1543 What's wrong?
###1546 Why are you all the way over here by yourself?
###1549 I'm dying, John.
###1552 What?
###1554 That's not even funny.
###1560 I'm gonna miss you.
###1562 It's almost over.
###1564 No, it's not almost over.
###1565 Yes, it is.
###1568 I leave tomorrow. I have to go back to schooI.
###1571 -So? -And you.
###1572 No, and me nothing. My commitment's up in 1 2 months.
###1577 And then I'm back. For good.
###1579 A lot could happen in 1 2 months, John.
###1582 You don't think I know that?
###1585 I know that.
###1588 And I'm not afraid at aIl.
###1594 I promise you...
###1596 ...that it'll all be over sooner than you think.
###1600 Then l'll be back for good.
###1604 You promise?
###1609 I promise.
###1631 I'm probably gonna be out of the Army way before you're out of school.
###1636 Am I gonna be in the audience when you graduate?
###1639 I think I might take a littIe Ionger to graduate.
###1642 Been spending so much time around your dad...
###1647 ...and I think now I want to teach special education.
###1651 -You don't say. -I don't know why it's taken me...
###1653 ...so long to realize. I mean, I've Iived next to Alan my whole life--
###1659 I'm sorry, back up. What does that have to do with my dad?
###1666 Well, there's....
###1669 I mean, there's an explanation for why he is the way he is.
###1675 Forget it. Never mind.
###1677 -No, no, no. -No, let's go. Come here.
###1679 What? So, just, what were you saying?
###1687 I grew up next to a kid with autism.
###1690 -I have a frame of reference. -Whoa, autistic?
###1692 You saying my dad's like Alan? You're saying my dad's retarded?
###1696 No, Alan's not retarded, John. He's autistic.
###1699 There are milder forms of it and these things go undiagnosed.
###1702 Is this what you've been doing? You've just been studying my dad?
###1706 No. How could you even say that?
###1708 I've Iived with my dad my entire life. Put up with him my entire life.
###1712 You think I don't know that he's not normal?
###1715 Yeah?
###1716 You think I need you to teIl me he's not normal?
###1722 Yeah.
###1728 Hey, soldier, leaving so soon, huh?
###1731 Here, have a beer. It's on me.
###1735 Come on, you should drink. It'll make you feeI better.
###1737 -Now's not a good time, all right? -You sad?
###1740 No, come on. You just need to reIax. Come on. Just relax a little bit.
###1743 What's going on with Savannah?
###1745 -Just leave me alone. -What's with Savannah?
###1747 -How about you get your hands off? -Come on.
###1750 What is happening with you and Savannah--?
###1752 Hey, man, what are you doing?
###1754 John!
###1756 Oh, my-- Oh, my God!
###1758 -John! -Stop him. What is he doing?
###1765 -HeIp him! -Oh, I'm so sorry.
###1794 I don't think she's home now.
###1796 But she hasn't gone back to school yet.
###1801 She normally comes by and says goodbye before she heads back, but....
###1810 Oh, shit, Tim.
###1812 Jesus, l'm sorRY, man.
###1814 Hey, I like it.
###1817 I think it makes me look pretty tough.
###1820 I just-- I had no idea it was you back there.
###1823 Hey, it was my fault.
###1825 I don't know what I was thinking, sneaking up behind a green beret.
###1829 Hey, if you see her...
###1832 ...can you give her a message for me?
###1834 Yeah.
###1837 Just teIl her I came by...
###1841 ...and that I....
###1843 You wanna write it down?
###1847 Yeah.
###1851 I'll make sure she gets it.
###1854 Thank you.
###1867 Hey, Pop.

###1899 -They're clean. -I'lI do it. I'll do it.
###1903 Okay.

###1958 Got your note.
###1961 -Short, sweet, to the point. -I'm sorry.
###1964 John, I'm sorry.
###1966 -I'm so sorry. -No, I'm sorry.
###1968 I didn't mean to make you feel that.
###1970 I have no idea what I'm talking about. No business pretending I'm a doctor.
###1974 -I was watching him today. -John.
###1976 Please, I'm serious. I don't know what I'm talking about.
###1979 I really don't. It means nothing.
###1981 Okay?
###1984 I'm headed back to schooI.
###1986 And I just wanted to make sure that, you know....
###1989 Make sure that what?
###1992 I made you a promise, didn't I?
###1996 Yeah.
###2000 You wrote your first note so l wrote mine.
###2006 Don't read it now. Wait till I'm gone.
###2008 Okay.

###2035 ...that's alI it took.
###2040 Two weeks for me to falL in love with you.
###2056 Now we have one year apart.
###2060 But what's one year apart after two weeks like that together?
###2074 -All right, Pop. -Okay.
###2076 I gotta go.
###2078 -You be good, okay? -Okay.
###2081 So....
###2083 -We're good. All right. See you later. -Okay.
###2096 You made me a promise.
###2098 A promise L know you'Ll keep.
###2101 So I onIy want one more promise from you during this time we spend apart.
###2106 TeLl me everything.
###2109 Write it alI down, John. ScribbIe it in a notebook.
###2112 Type it out, e-maiL it to me...
###2115 ...I don't care, but I wanna know everything.
###2120 Then we'Ll be with each other alI the time even if we're not with each other.
###2126 That way before we know it, I'Ll see you soon, then.
###2141 -What's up, girls? -Johnny!
###2143 What up, man?
###2144 -Hey, there he is. -Look who it is.
###2146 -Welcome back, John. -Look at you.
###2148 Welcome back. Take a look at your voucher.
###2150 All right.
###2153 How was Atlantic City, man?
###2158 No, laugh it up. That's great. Yeah. That's the one thing I ask him.
###2161 I didn't say. First time l've seen him.
###2163 -Wouldn't ask if you didn't know. -How could he know?
###2166 Don't even bother unpacking, guys.
###2168 We move out bright and early. Enjoy.
###2173 Well, I'm excited.
###2183 Dear Savannah, L promise. I promise L'lL see you soon, then.
###2188 I promise L'lI write all the time.
###2190 I promise L'lL teLl you everything.
###2196 Be patient with me, it may take a whiLe for these Letters to get back to you.
###2201 We've already been deployed out on a mission.
###2206 Come on, soldier, move it, move it. Let's go!
###2211 The problem is we can't exactly use the local postaL system here.
###2217 And there's no such thing as Internet connection.
###2219 So I have to send everything from here out by airmail.
###2223 -Can you get this out for me? -Yeah. Yeah.
###2225 -Don't lose it, all right? -Yeah, I gotcha.
###2231 Unfortunately, l'm not allowed to say exactLy where here is.
###2236 AlL l can teLl you is where we've been sent...
###2238 ...makes me miss America very much.
###2241 And the lack of anything resembling an ocean makes me miss Charleston.
###2274 And everything around me makes me miss you.
###2280 We move around a Lot. so letters tend to come late and out of order.
###2284 We may want to number our letters...
###2286 ...just so we know which order we wrote them in.
###2290 But when they do finaIly get here...
###2293 ...it's a good day.
###2296 -Whenever they don't... -All right, let's see here.
###2300 Not for me. Not for me.
###2303 Not for me. And not for me.
###2307 Figures.
###2308 -...it's not. -Nothing for you either.
###2310 But L know they'lL stiLl come. I know it.
###2322 That's right.
###2328 Letter Number 8.
###2330 Dear John, L'm back at my parents' farm for the weekend.
###2334 And they have some house guests you may know.
###2340 Savannah!
###2346 I think that horse suits you just fine.
###2349 I took Alan out riding with me today. It was his first time on a horse.
###2355 You Iook good on that horse, Alan.
###2357 You've heard of horse sense, horses are somehow abIe to sense danger?
###2361 Sense out eviL?
###2363 WeLl, l think autistic kids have that too...
###2367 ...so L had this idea.
###2369 This dream.
###2372 I wanna open up a summer camp for autistic kids.
###2375 I've never seen him act like this before.
###2378 Are you hungry?
###2380 Where they can ride horses as much as they want.
###2383 Are you hungry?
###2386 For once in their life, a pIace where they won't have to worry about a thing.
###2391 What do you think? Pipe dream, huh?
###2394 No, it's not a pipe dream.
###2396 It's a perfect dream.
###2400 Erget. MerRY Christmas.
###2404 John, to a Mr. John Tyree.
###2407 -Shut up, man. -Seven?
###2408 -Stop moving around. -Can I keep this one?
###2411 Letter Number 33.
###2413 Dear Savannah, the good news is we've been sent somewhere new.
###2418 Although L can't teLl you where that is either.
###2421 The bad news is, this pLace actualLy makes me miss the old pIace.
###2425 But it's a full moon here tonight, which makes me think of you.
###2428 Because l know that no matter what I'm doing, no matter where l am...
###2433 ...this moon wiLl always be the same size as yours.
###2436 Half a world away.
###2438 Dear John...
###2440 ...most nights I falI asleep worrying about you.
###2444 Wondering where you may be out there.
###2448 Not tonight.
###2450 Tonight you're here with me.
###2456 I visited your dad yesterday.
###2460 Summer's aLmost over and I wanted to see him before I went back to schooI.
###2464 I hope that's okay.
###2465 Hey.
###2467 I made you a pie.
###2469 He made me dinner. It was Sunday so we had lasagna.
###2473 And L got him talking about his coins. So we had plenty of conversation.
###2477 This one is kind of a cull, a coin that's in really bad shape.
###2482 -WorthIess to most collectors. -But not to you.
###2485 No, not to me.
###2487 What is your favorite coin?
###2490 Out of aIl the coins that you have, what is your absolute favorite coin?
###2495 Do you have one?
###2506 'Seventy-eight Jefferson mule.
###2510 That'd be my favorite.
###2512 Definitely.
###2515 Why? Is it worth the most?
###2518 Well, it's worth a lot, not the most.
###2521 But, you know....
###2524 What's the stoRY behind it?
###2532 Here's one....
###2533 So I'll ask you instead, John, wherever you may be.
###2542 Dear Savannah, only because I promised to telL you everything.
###2548 Thank you.
###2550 When L was 7 years old, I bought an ice cream cone.
###2555 On the way home, L noticed one of the pennies wasn't actuaLly a penny.
###2573 I don't know.
###2576 I don't know. Never seen anything like it.
###2581 Did you find this, son?
###2584 Yeah?
###2586 No, it's a mule.
###2589 -It's a what? -A mule. An error coin.
###2593 Every now and then they make mistakes...
###2595 ...batch accidentaIly slips through, this thing...
###2597 ...head's a nickel, tail's a penny. Mule. Really more of a novelty than anything.
###2602 Remember the horse sense you were taIking about?
###2605 --the kid found it I wilI buy it anyway.
###2607 Twenty bucks.
###2612 -No, thank you. -WeLl, my dad has it too.
###2614 Now, wait a minute. Hang on.
###2617 Let me take another look at that real quick.
###2622 John, let's go.
###2624 I'll be damned.
###2626 -Do you know what this is? -No.
###2638 Look at that.
###2639 That's your coin.
###2641 You want my advice?
###2643 Dad to Dad?
###2644 Keep it.
###2646 Hold on to it. Pass it down to your son.
###2649 Let him pass it to his son and on and on, I'll tell you what...
###2652 ...30, 40, a hundred years from now...
###2656 ...you're gonna have something worth a whole lot more than $4000.
###2660 I promise you.
###2663 Hey.
###2665 Do you want to keep it?
###2669 -Good for you. -Thank you. Thank you.
###2673 At first L Loved chasing after those muIes with my father.
###2676 We finalLy had something to talk about.
###2678 You know, something we couLd do together.
###2681 But he became obsessed with them. You know how he is.
###2685 And then l became a teenager and you know how L am.
###2689 All the way up to Wooster for another coin show. I'm just--
###2692 No, I'm not doing that.
###2694 You're going to one eveRY weekend now.
###2698 Oh, that's good. I love warm milk. That's nice.
###2702 You spend all of our money on coins. Get a fricking fridge that works.
###2714 EventuaLly he stopped talking about coins with me altogether.
###2719 And when that happened...
###2720 ...we found there wasn't all that much left to talk about.
###2729 So that's the story.
###2734 I miss you so much it hurts.
###2738 Sorry, sorry.
###2740 Oh, my God. My brother was in the towers.
###2743 -I love you too, babe. -Please call me as soon as you can.
###2752 -Susan. Susan, is my dad there? -Just calm down.
###2792 All right, fellas, here's the deal.
###2794 Requesting permission to extend my tour, sir.
###2797 Requesting permission to extend, sir.
###2799 Requesting permission to extend as well, sir.
###2801 Requesting permission to extend, sir.
###2803 Requesting permission to extend as well, sir.
###2805 Okay, guys, listen. We're gonna get our orders from Operations on Monday.
###2809 Before we do anything rash, let's take the weekend to mulI this over, alI right?
###2813 I got a wife and kids to think about.
###2816 Nobody's asking you to stay on too, captain.
###2818 Yeah, you are. This is my team.
###2821 Where you go, I go.
###2822 Where we go, we aIl go.
###2825 If everyone stilI wants to extend on Monday, then we'll do it.
###2828 Together.
###2834 Don't get into trouble over there.
###2835 -Take care of yourself. -Always.
###2838 Let's go, man. The plane to Paris leaves in an hour.
###2840 You ready? Are you ready?
###2842 -It's gonna be amazing. -I can't go.
###2844 What? Of course you're going.
###2846 I gotta go to Charleston.
###2847 -You're going to Charleston? -Yup.
###2849 What are you, nuts? We got two days off, man.
###2851 By the time you fly there and back, you're gonna have like 1 8 hours.
###2855 It's 1 8 more than I had this morning.
###2858 I don't know when I'll get that again...
###2860 ...so I gotta go.
###2862 Nothing I can say to change your mind?
###2864 Nope.
###2874 John!
###2878 John. John.
###2917 You sure he--? He actualIy said that? He wants to come?
###2922 I think he will.
###2924 -He wasn't so sure about it, but.... -Yeah, I'll bet he wasn't.
###2928 --has asked President Bush to activate...
###2930 ...thousands of miIitary reservists.
###2936 Hey, Pop!
###2940 Hey, what are you doing in here?
###2942 Look at you.
###2945 Spiffy.
###2946 Are you coming with us?
###2948 Please. My parents are so excited to meet you, Mr. Tyree.
###2952 Yeah.
###2956 You hungry?
###2958 I made meatloaf.
###2961 I know you made meatloaf, Pop. It's Saturday.
###2963 We can take it with us.
###2965 We can take it with us. You mind if we take it with us?
###2968 Well, I don't....
###2970 Is that okay? I'll wrap it up.
###2986 I don't mean-- I'm sorry, but could--?
###2989 Could you stop the car, because I need to go back.
###2992 -Should I turn around? -Stop the car, please. Stop the car.
###2995 -Forget something? -Okay.
###2996 No, I need to get out of the car. Please.
###2998 -All right, just-- Just relax, okay? -Yeah.
###3001 I don't think I can do this.
###3003 -Look, you're fine. You're fine. -No, I just-- Please. I need to get out.
###3008 You're okay, Pop. It's fine.
###3010 -Look, stop the car, I can't-- -Okay, I'll turn around.
###3013 We're fine, we're fine, we're fine.
###3015 -I gotta get out. Stop the car. -Okay, all right.
###3020 -Come on, Dad, stop! -Okay.
###3021 Pop. Come on, don't do that.
###3032 Hey, Mr. Tyree.
###3034 Hey, you all right?
###3036 -You okay? -I'm sorry.
###3037 It's okay.
###3039 But hey, let's....
###3044 We're gonna wait for you in the car, all right?
###3055 -No, I'm fine, I'm fine. -No, don't, honestly,
###3057 We can stay. Let's just stay.
###3060 Okay? Let's stay, because I can go next year.
###3065 Pop, I only got one night.
###3069 I mean, l gotta go back. Do you understand that?
###3072 You shouId go. You both should go.
###3083 New York Mayor RudoIph Giuliani said WaLl street wiIl re-open on Monday.
###3088 He tried. At least he tried.
###3101 Hello, welcome.
###3106 My girl.
###3110 Mom, this is John.
###3111 John, I feel like I already know you. Where's your father, did he come too?
###3116 -No, ma'am. -Oh, that's okay.
###3118 I'm just glad that you made it home safe.
###3122 We thought about canceling with everything that's going on...
###3125 ...but we felt like eveRYbody should be together.
###3128 I've been briefing him in the car and l think he's good.
###3130 It was good intel. With solid tactical training, I'm as ready as I'll ever be.
###3135 I love him already.
###3137 Mrs. Curtis, Savannah.
###3139 -Hey, dude, how's it going? -John.
###3141 It's good to see you again.
###3145 All right, You know what? You Iook like you could use a drink.
###3149 -I'lI grab one for you. -Yes, thank you.
###3152 -John. -What's he doing here?
###3154 He's here because I invited him. His famiIy lives just up the street.
###3158 What are you, Iike, hanging out now?
###3160 He's reaIly not that bad once you get to know him, I swear to you, John.
###3166 Here you go.
###3169 It's bourbon, it's not gonna kill you.
###3171 Be right back.
###3176 We got off on the wrong foot and l want to apologize for the way I treated you.
###3180 If l had known that Savannah was actually gonna stay with you...
###3184 ...l wouldn't have treated you that way. In all seriousness, I'm sorry.
###3191 Fair enough.
###3192 If you need anything and....
###3195 -Enjoy yourself. -Right.
###3198 So this is him.
###3200 Yup. No tough-guy routine from you, Dad.
###3203 Routine? I bench press refrigerators, honey.
###3206 Your boyfriends need to know these things.
###3208 He's absolutely right. Nice to meet you, Mr. Curtis.
###3211 But l think Tim here might have already beat you to the punch.
###3214 He said he'd rough me up if ever I hurt her.
###3216 I was very convincing too. I think I made quite an impact.
###3219 Well, cheers, son. Glad you could join us.
###3222 Thank you, sir.
###3223 -Billy! You actually showed up! -See, hard part's over.
###3229 -Good to see you again, John. -How you doing, Tim?
###3232 Hi. Hey, Tim, how are you doing?
###3235 -Good. -I haven't seen your wife. Is she here?
###3238 Yeah, she's on vacation actually.
###3241 -So I'll tell her you said hello. -Please do.
###3244 I wilI.
###3246 Alan, remember what we talked about?
###3252 Another vacation?
###3254 Yeah.
###3258 Alan ever ask about her?
###3261 Yeah, he does. I just don't know what to say.
###3265 Hey, look, I'm not a father.
###3271 You know, I'm really in no position to give you advice at all.
###3276 When I was a kid, I waited around every day...
###3278 ...hoping that today would finaIly be the day...
###3280 ...that my mom would come home.
###3284 I waited around 1 5 years.
###3286 So l know how painful it might have been for my dad to...
###3291 ...just teIl me the truth.
###3294 It would have saved me a lot of waiting around.
###3297 You know?
###3301 Well, I guess if the worst thing you can say about your father...
###3305 ...is he tried to protect you too much then...
###3309 ...that's a pretty good father, isn't it?
###3312 I'm sorry. You're John, right? Savannah's John?
###3316 -Yes, sir. -I wanna thank you for what you do.
###3318 Know our prayers are with you. I hope whatever happens...
###3321 ...it'lI be over soon. So you boys can come home safe and sound.
###3324 Oh, it won't be over anytime soon.
###3327 Afghanistan will just be the first stop of many.
###3330 He's right, you know. Pretty soon they'Il ask y'all to reenlist for another tour.
###3334 Slowly but surely they'll stop asking and start telling.
###3337 None of the soldiers I know need to be asked, sir.
###3339 And we sure don't need to be told.
###3342 What do you mean by we?
###3352 It was great to see you guys. See you next year.
###3356 Savannah....
###3364 So you're gonna reenlist, just like that?
###3369 It's something we shouId talk about.
###3372 Two more years, John.
###3381 Have you already done it? Have you already re-upped?
###3385 No.
###3387 But you decided that you're going to?
###3393 Do I have a say?
###3395 Do I have a say in this?
###3398 -You don't understand. -Don't ever tell me I don't understand.
###3423 Leave me alone, John.
###3430 Please.
###3434 What do you...?
###3437 What do you want from me?
###3438 Savannah, I mean....
###3442 Just teIl me what you want from me. I mean, you want me to quit?
###3446 Is that it?
###3449 Look, I don't know how we got here. I don't know what happened.
###3453 Just woke up and...
###3456 ...there's buildings falling and....
###3459 I mean, l had a plan-- I had a plan, but now l don't.
###3462 And I have no idea what to do.
###3466 I don't know what to do and l just-- All I know is I wanna stay here.
###3469 I just wanna stay right here with you as long as l possibly can.
###3473 You're just all that matters, okay? You're all that matters to me.
###3476 I'm trying to figure out what the right thing is and I don't know.
###3479 I don't have any idea how to get there. I just-- Because I need you to tell me.
###3484 I just need you to tell me, okay?
###3486 Can you just tell me, please--? Just teIl me what you want me to do.
###3500 I want you to come with me.
###3652 Hey, Pop.
###3661 Thank you. Thank you for coming.
###3663 Well....
###3669 So you think you're gonna be okay by yourself this time?
###3673 Yeah, why wouldn't I be?
###3682 I should probably be getting going.
###3687 Take care of yourself.
###3713 So are we...? I mean, we're okay though.
###3716 Right? Nothing has changed?
###3728 Be careful not to step in any fires, okay?
###3731 Okay. l will.
###3737 So l'Il see you soon, then.
###3739 I'll see you soon, then.
###3774 Welcome back, guys.
###3777 Hope you had a good weekend. Wish it could've been longer...
###3780 ...but sometimes you got to take what you can get.
###3784 So that's it then?
###3795 It's unanimous?
###3799 Okay.
###3801 I'll start the paperwork.
###3857 Thank you, sir.
###3858 O'Neill, here you go!
###3862 This smells pretty good, Russ.
###3864 And we got Daniels. Where's he at?
###3890 Move, move, move, up and shoot!
###3940 -Hey, yo. -Yeah, nothing today, man. Sorry.
###3987 Go, go, go.
###3993 Yo, you guys seen John? Is he back here?
###3998 Yo, John.
###4000 Got one for you, dude.
###4002 -Yeah? -That's it, though.
###4015 Dear John, l know it's been way too long since L last wrote you.
###4022 I've been staring at this blank page for the last two hours.
###4026 WeLl, if l'm being honest...
###4029 ...I've been staring at it for the last two months.
###4033 Please forgive me for what l'm about to say.
###4038 And know that this is the hardest thing I've ever had to do.
###4045 My life without you has no meaning.
###4048 And L cannot Live.... L'm sorry.
###4053 Yo, listen to this, hedge fund manager on Wall Street, right?
###4059 How much do you think he made at his regular job?
###4063 Twenty-seven million dollars, he ran a hedge fund. Works on WaIl Street.
###4069 That is amazing.
###4093 You making mud pies, buddy?
###4105 What's going on, man?
###4113 You wanna talk about it?
###4116 Nothing to talk about.
###4122 She found somebody else.
###4129 You got any idea who it is?
###4132 No, she didn't say.
###4135 I mean, l got a pretty good idea.
###4141 Look, man...
###4143 ...you know, this happens, dude. I mean, you'll get her back.
###4146 You get home, she comes running.
###4148 -It's the whole cycle, dude. -They already got engaged.
###4154 Jesus.
###4157 Hey, I'm sorry, man.
###4160 Let me know if I can do anything, all right?
###4177 --off the bottom rim. You wouldn't think a squirrel could swim, but I swear...
###4182 ...swam 20 yards to the shoreline.
###4185 -Swimming squirreI. -That's crazy, dude.
###4187 Hey, notice that. Did y'all see that?
###4190 I mean, that's as sexy as it gets around here.
###4192 They can't show their legs, so they got fishnets on their faces.
###4196 I'm gonna bring that back to the States and make my girl wear that.
###4200 How mysterious.
###4213 Back up, back up!
###4215 -What's he saying? -Hey, he's speaking Turkish.

###4226 What languages you speak? Come here.
###4228 -Good work, man. -Stay right there.
###4230 -Hey, where are you going? -Somebody's gotta figure it out.
###4234 -Noodles, go with him. -Yeah.
###4236 Back up, back up.
###4238 Tyree!
###4241 Wait for further instructions.
###4243 Let's move out.
###4253 -Good? -Yeah, you?
###4262 We got a man down! Noodles, you gonna be all right, man! Hold on, man!
###4266 Copy that, man down! Man down!
###4271 -Come here. -You see it?
###4273 I got you. Get your hands up!
###4275 Tyree, do you read? TaLk to me, Tyree.
###4277 Lucky SOB. It hit your plate.
###4278 Jesus, l never loved a piece of clothing more in my entire life, I swear to God.
###4289 John!
###4293 Man down! Medic!
###4294 Medic! John.
###4297 Come on, man.
###4298 Medic!
###4300 Look, come on, you're gonna be fine, all right? It's nothing.
###4303 It's nothing. You got this.
###4306 Stay awake, okay? You just look in my eyes, just look in my eyes!
###4312 Keep your eyes open, okay?
###4316 Eyes, awake, awake, right at me, okay?
###4320 Jakes!
###4341 Welcome back, Sergeant Tyree.
###4344 Rest easy, okay? You're in the hospital in Germany.
###4347 And you're gonna be just fine.
###4413 Tyree.
###4414 -You look good, man. -Thank you, sir.
###4417 I just wanted to come by and let you know l'Il be extending.
###4421 Extending. Tyree, it's been three months.
###4424 I'm impressed, but I'm not stupid.
###4426 Go home, John. Get some R&R.
###4429 Keep your dad some company for a while.
###4435 Have a seat.
###4440 Listen, I'm being transferred.
###4443 Now, this has nothing to do with what happened.
###4446 My captain duties are done here.
###4448 Going back to Fort Bragg. I actually miss my famiIy.
###4454 That's good, sir.
###4455 Berry and Daniels are getting out, the others, coming down on assignment.
###4459 -And you've got Iess than four months-- -I'm definitely extending.
###4463 Your war is over, John. You served your country well.
###4468 You know what? I might just make this a career.
###4473 No talking you out of this, huh?
###4503 Mark, on my mark!
###4508 Mark!
###4520 Where you thinking next?
###4523 Oh, man. I don't know, wherever they send us.
###4527 Actually, we're sending you home to the States, John.
###4532 I'm sorry, we just got the news.
###4554 He's conscious, but he's not lucid.
###4557 And he's hardIy ever responsive.
###4559 It's hard for me to say how severe the stroke really is...
###4562 ...because we don't know how long he was down before they found him.
###4567 If l'd have been there to find him like that earlier...
###4572 ...do you think it would've made a difference?
###4575 I doubt it. I really doubt it.
###4649 -Hey, Jeff, here's that scan. -No problem.
###4666 Hey, Pop.
###4668 What--? What the heck do you--? Ma'am, why do you have him out here?
###4674 You okay? How you feeIing?
###4682 I....
###4686 I mean, it's nothing, but I wrote you-- I wrote you a Ietter.
###4698 No, no, don't read it now. You don't have to--
###4700 I didn't think you'd-- Why don't you read it when I'm not around?
###4711 You know what? The hell with it. I'll just read it to you.
###4724 "Dear Dad.
###4726 There's something I've been wanting to tell you.
###4731 You remember a few years back...
###4734 ...when I got shot.
###4738 Well, you wanna know the very first thing...
###4740 ...that entered my mind at that moment?
###4743 Right before I blacked out?
###4748 Coins.
###4753 Suddenly I was 8 years old again.
###4755 I was on that tour of the U.S. Mint.
###4758 I was listening to the guide explain how coins are made.
###4761 How they're punched out of sheet metal and how they're rimmed and beveled.
###4765 How they're stamped and cleaned.
###4767 And how each and every batch of coins are personally examined...
###4771 ...in case any have slipped through with the slightest imperfection.
###4777 Do you remember that, Dad?
###4779 I mean, do you remember that trip to Philadelphia we took?
###4786 That's what popped into my head.
###4792 I'm a coin of the United States Army.
###4797 And I was minted in the year 1 980.
###4801 I've been punched from sheet metal.
###4804 I've been stamped and cleaned.
###4808 And my edges have been rimmed and beveled.
###4815 But now I have two small holes in me.
###4818 So l'm no longer in perfect condition."
###4825 How about it, Dad? You know, we're just a couple of cuIls here, huh?
###4835 "But there's one-- There's one more thing...
###4838 ...that l want to telI you too.
###4844 After l got shot, you know, right before I blacked out.
###4855 You wanna know the very last thing I thought of?"
###4861 I'm sorry.
###4872 The very last thing I thought of....
###4875 You wanna know the very last thing I thought of?
###4976 I'm so sorRY, I don't want to rush you...
###4980 ...but we have another service coming in.
###5078 John.
###5092 What brings you home?
###5097 It's my dad.
###5101 How's your dad?
###5104 He....
###5116 I'm sorry.
###5119 I wish I had known.
###5124 It's okay.
###5127 It wouldn't have made any difference.
###5129 I'm so sorRY.
###5132 He's-- He was a really good man.
###5146 You finally did it, huh?
###5150 Camp Horse Sense.
###5152 No.
###5154 I didn't. I tried.
###5157 It only lasted one summer after we took over this place from my parents.
###5162 It was.... It was expensive.
###5181 Do you want to come inside?
###5184 It's just me.
###5190 When do you have to go back?
###5193 As soon as I get my dad's stuff squared away.
###5201 Have you settled down yet?
###5204 No.
###5207 But you must be dating a lot, huh?
###5209 No. I don't think you can call it dating exactly.
###5216 It's so good to see you.
###5218 Here. Alive.
###5225 Hold on. I'm just gonna-- I'm sorry.
###5231 Hello?
###5233 Hey.
###5235 No, I'm fine.
###5243 I....
###5245 Well, John-- John is here.
###5250 Yeah, John Tyree.
###5255 Yeah, I'm gonna leave soon.
###5259 Okay, l'Il see you.
###5260 I'll be there in like 20 minutes, okay?
###5263 I love you too. Bye.
###5272 He wants to see you.
###5274 Wait, what?
###5280 It's Tim?
###5287 Initially after he was diagnosed, he was so optimistic.
###5292 He wasn't concerned, all he cared about was AIan...
###5294 ...which was inspiring.
###5297 It wasn't until after the cancer spread to stage four that I noticed a big change.
###5303 What kind of cancer is it?
###5305 Lymphoma.
###5309 He's had it with being cooped up in that room...
###5312 ...so he basically just spends all his time out here.
###5314 Sometimes with Alan.
###5322 -Can I have a crumble cake? -Alan, do you remember John?
###5327 Hello, John.
###5328 Hey, AIan.
###5330 He's gotten big.
###5333 -How are you? -Good.
###5338 I'm gonna get him a crumble cake.
###5340 Oh, that's a good idea. He's been talking about that.
###5343 Come on, Alan.
###5350 I guess you must want to kick my ass, huh?
###5353 There's not a lot I can do about it here, is there?
###5360 It's all part of my master plan.
###5363 Hell of a plan.
###5369 I love her.
###5373 Everything that happened in my Iife before, it's gone now.
###5378 It's been wiped clean.
###5381 I wanted to tell you that.
###5386 And I'm sorry.
###5389 I'm sorry for how it happened with you so far away.
###5394 But l know now that Alan will always have someone to take care of him.
###5402 He will always be in good hands.
###5423 She still loves you, you know.
###5425 Why is it black?
###5427 It's plain as day, you can see it all over her face.
###5433 I wish that weren't the case...
###5435 ...but she's never looked at me the way she used to look at you.
###5443 You shouId know that.
###5456 Be careful, AIan.
###5461 He still loves those horses, huh?
###5463 Yeah, he'll be out there till bedtime.
###5468 I gotta get him out of that hospital.
###5472 He needs to come home.
###5475 There's a company in Texas with an experimental drug.
###5480 That might help.
###5484 But the insurance companies don't pay for it, of course.
###5489 My parents sold their beach house a year ago.
###5493 Which was a godsend.
###5496 We've done a few fundraisers.
###5501 But l never would have guessed that we would run out so fast.
###5513 Stay for dinner, okay?
###5522 So you drink now.
###5524 Just a glass or two at dinner.
###5527 Tim got me started a couple years ago.
###5538 Why are you looking at me like that?
###5540 What do you mean?
###5542 How am I looking at you?
###5545 Differently.
###5548 I don't know, how do you want me to look at you?
###5551 You're different.
###5563 I don't know--
###5568 I don't know why I came here. I mean, what are we doing?
###5575 We're sitting here and we're eating and we're talking...
###5578 ...but no one's actually saying anything.
###5581 What do you want me to say? What do you want to talk about?
###5591 Why didn't you call?
###5596 Why didn't you call me?
###5601 I mean, did I not deserve any more explanation than...
###5607 ...that letter?
###5610 You couldn't have called me?
###5611 You couldn't have given me some sort of chance to change your mind?
###5616 Don't you think you owed me that?
###5622 I couldn't.
###5624 You couldn't?
###5625 You thought that little of me that you couldn't have just called me.
###5629 Why?
###5632 Because I couldn't.
###5635 Give me an answer. Why? Why not?
###5637 -Because I couIdn't. -An answer.
###5638 Because just hearing your voice, I would have changed my mind.
###5648 Is that what you wanna hear, John? What you came all this way to hear?
###5652 You think it was tough out there? Think it was easy for me without you?
###5656 You thought that eveRY single day it wasn't...
###5659 ...a goddamn marathon of my life without you?
###5663 Tim was sick.
###5666 He was sick and he needed me.
###5668 He needed me to help him.
###5670 He needed me to help him with Alan, with everything.
###5673 I was alone and I had no idea what I was doing.
###5679 I didn't plan this. I didn't know that it was gonna happen to me.
###5683 But it did.
###5685 You don't think I've tried--?
###5687 I picked up the phone a thousand times to try to call you.
###5691 You think that I really wanna be standing here in front of you like this?
###5699 I had no choice.
###5702 I know.
###5713 I saved eveRY single one of them.
###5718 You've been so many places.
###5723 I think the yeIlow enveIopes are from Africa or something.
###5727 Really?
###5729 I even have your first, your veRY first letter to me.
###5735 Tim's water bill.
###5747 Sorry.
###5749 It's okay.
###5754 Hope you have more where that came from.
###5783 I'm gonna put a pot of coffee on.
###5808 I should go.
###5824 I'll see you soon, then?
###5832 Say it back.
###5835 When I say it, you say it.
###5839 Remember?
###5847 John?
###5851 Just say it.
###5864 Goodbye, Savannah.
###5924 I don't think you remember me. But I believe you knew my father, Bill Tyree.
###5929 Oh, yeah, of course I did. I haven't seen him in a while, though. How is he?
###5933 He recently passed.
###5936 I'm sorry.
###5939 I think you might've offered to buy his coin collection one time. ls that right?
###5943 Sure did. More than once.
###5945 Just out of curiosity, how much do you think a collection Iike his is worth?
###5950 A collection that big? I don't know, I'd have to see it.
###5956 Look, I only got about one condition.
###5961 All the mules, they gotta stay together.
###5964 You can sell them as a set or keep them for yourself.
###5967 They have to stay together.
###5968 You're really going to seIl me all his coins?
###5970 Yes, sir.
###5972 All but one.
###5976 This comes up nickel, we're gonna set up right here. We got shade.
###5980 It comes up penny, we'll be up on the ridge. We got visibility.
###5986 -That'd be penny side. -All right, let's go to the ridge.
###5992 Sergeant.
###5995 Thank you.
###6001 Dear John...
###6004 ...it's been almost five years since I wrote with an actual pen...
###6008 ...on an actual sheet of paper.
###6011 I thought L couLd write and teLl you...
###6013 ...all that's happened since I saw you last.
###6017 A few weeks after you showed up here...
###6019 ...Tim received an anonymous donation.
###6022 A donation that was enough to give him...
###6025 ...what the insurance companies wouIdn't:
###6028 Time.
###6033 Time to finalIy come home.
###6037 Time to spend with his son.
###6041 Time to say goodbye.
###6046 The problem with time, I've learned...
###6048 ...whether it's those first two weeks I got to spend with you...
###6052 ...or those final two months I got to spend with him...
###6055 ...eventuaLly time aLways runs out.
###6061 I have no idea where you are out there in the world, John.
###6065 But L understand that I Lost the right to know these things long ago.
###6072 No matter how many years go by...
###6076 ...I know one thing to be as true as it ever was.
###6081 I'Ll see you soon, then.
