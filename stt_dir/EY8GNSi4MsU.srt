1
0:0:0,667 --> 0:0:1,75
Male Narrator:
Earth's population


2
0:0:1,75 --> 0:0:5,0
has now passed seven billion. 


3
0:0:5,0 --> 0:0:7,625
And world energy consumption
is projected to increase


4
0:0:7,625 --> 0:0:12,25
more than 25% during
the next 15 years,


5
0:0:12,25 --> 0:0:16,0
and may nearly double
by the year 2050.


6
0:0:16,0 --> 0:0:19,125
But how much energy we need,
and how we get it,


7
0:0:19,125 --> 0:0:21,792
depends on choices
we make now.


8
0:0:21,792 --> 0:0:24,542
And those energy choices
have consequences


9
0:0:24,542 --> 0:0:26,583
for Earth's climate.


10
0:0:26,583 --> 0:0:31,42
We already see the promise
of 21st century renewables.


11
0:0:31,42 --> 0:0:33,917
But, today,
most big nations still rely


12
0:0:33,917 --> 0:0:36,25
on 19th century technologies.


13
0:0:36,25 --> 0:0:37,542
Lykke Friss:
At a global perspective,


14
0:0:37,542 --> 0:0:41,5
we simply know that the age
of cheap energy is over.


15
0:0:41,5 --> 0:0:43,83
Narrator:
Innovative projects prove


16
0:0:43,83 --> 0:0:46,125
that wind can power
entire communities.


17
0:0:46,125 --> 0:0:48,292
And conservation
and efficiency can cut


18
0:0:48,292 --> 0:0:53,833
projected world energy demand
thirty per cent by 2030.


19
0:0:53,833 --> 0:0:55,167
Richard Alley:
But how to get there?


20
0:0:55,167 --> 0:0:58,42
That's not just a technological
question of solar cells


21
0:0:58,42 --> 0:1:0,458
and wind turbines,
but depends on choices


22
0:1:0,458 --> 0:1:3,542
made by real people living
in the real world.


23
0:1:3,542 --> 0:1:5,958
And that means economics
and politics,


24
0:1:5,958 --> 0:1:9,958
national security, jobs--
why we do what we do.


25
0:1:9,958 --> 0:1:11,25
I'm Richard Alley.


26
0:1:11,25 --> 0:1:14,375
I'm an Earth scientist,
a parent and a professor,


27
0:1:14,375 --> 0:1:17,875
concerned for my kids',
and my students' future.


28
0:1:17,875 --> 0:1:20,208
I've studied our planet's
changing ice sheets


29
0:1:20,208 --> 0:1:22,375
and climate history,


30
0:1:22,375 --> 0:1:24,375
and tried to come up
with numbers for how much


31
0:1:24,375 --> 0:1:29,125
renewable energy
our planet offers.


32
0:1:29,125 --> 0:1:30,75
Narrator:
Geologist Richard Alley


33
0:1:30,75 --> 0:1:34,792
is one of the 97%
of climate experts who believe


34
0:1:34,792 --> 0:1:39,833
current energy practices are
warming the planet.


35
0:1:39,833 --> 0:1:42,708
But that the answers
are out there,


36
0:1:42,708 --> 0:1:44,542
Blowing in the wind,


37
0:1:44,542 --> 0:1:46,958
Shining down from above,


38
0:1:46,958 --> 0:1:51,167
And in the minds of inventors
and engineers.


39
0:1:51,167 --> 0:1:54,375
Soren Hermansen: Technology
is easy, we'll find solutions.


40
0:1:54,375 --> 0:1:56,542
It's a matter
of making decisions.


41
0:1:56,542 --> 0:1:58,125
Narrator:
Building a nation's energy


42
0:1:58,125 --> 0:2:1,0
infrastructure takes decades.


43
0:2:1,0 --> 0:2:3,542
Now some energy insiders
wonder if America


44
0:2:3,542 --> 0:2:6,458
is still up to the task.


45
0:2:6,458 --> 0:2:7,542
John Hofmeister:
You need to think of energy


46
0:2:7,542 --> 0:2:9,667
in a 50 year time frame.


47
0:2:9,667 --> 0:2:12,458
And our elected officials
are thinking of energy


48
0:2:12,458 --> 0:2:14,917
in two-year election cycles.


49
0:2:14,917 --> 0:2:16,917
That's ridiculous!


50
0:2:16,917 --> 0:2:18,25
Richard Alley:
But I'm optimistic


51
0:2:18,25 --> 0:2:21,125
we can get to a world
with more people living better


52
0:2:21,125 --> 0:2:24,375
while using cleaner and more
sustainable energy.


53
0:2:24,375 --> 0:2:31,667
And that's why we call this
program Powering The Planet.


54
0:2:31,667 --> 0:2:35,833
Announcer: Powering the Planet-
Earth: The Operators' Manual


55
0:2:35,833 --> 0:2:40,792
is made possible by NSF, the
National Science Foundation,


56
0:2:40,792 --> 0:3:2,83
where discoveries begin.


57
0:3:2,83 --> 0:3:5,417
Narrator: Planet Earth is awash
in renewable energy.


58
0:3:5,417 --> 0:3:9,5
The oceans store heat
and offer wave and tidal power.


59
0:3:9,5 --> 0:3:13,167
Plants harvest sunlight
and store its energy.


60
0:3:13,167 --> 0:3:16,583
The Sun warms the atmosphere
and sets air in motion,


61
0:3:16,583 --> 0:3:19,625
and we're getting better
at tapping wind power.


62
0:3:19,625 --> 0:3:22,125
But the biggest and most
promising energy source


63
0:3:22,125 --> 0:3:30,542
is the nearby star that lights
our days and warms our world.


64
0:3:30,542 --> 0:3:32,667
Sunlight reaching
the Earth's surface offers


65
0:3:32,667 --> 0:3:36,458
about 120,000 terawatts.


66
0:3:36,458 --> 0:3:38,875
If the Sun's energy were spread
around the world,


67
0:3:38,875 --> 0:3:43,375
it would average around
240 watts per square meter.


68
0:3:43,375 --> 0:3:47,583
Richard Alley brings that huge
number down to earth.


69
0:3:47,583 --> 0:3:49,542
Alley: If I walk out
into this little patch


70
0:3:49,542 --> 0:3:54,292
of this great desert, and I hold
out my arms about like this--


71
0:3:54,292 --> 0:3:57,292
And then another of me
does the same thing--


72
0:3:57,292 --> 0:3:59,625
And each of me
is holding two 60 watt


73
0:3:59,625 --> 0:4:3,917
incandescent light bulbs,
or 10 compact fluorescents,


74
0:4:3,917 --> 0:4:8,542
that's 240 watts per square
meter that I'm marking out here.


75
0:4:8,542 --> 0:4:10,708
That's a lot of energy.


76
0:4:10,708 --> 0:4:13,875
And averaged across the globe,
day and night,


77
0:4:13,875 --> 0:4:16,5
summer and winter,
that's how much sunlight


78
0:4:16,5 --> 0:4:22,875
is available
to power the planet.


79
0:4:22,875 --> 0:4:25,542
Let's see what it takes
to turn that vast potential


80
0:4:25,542 --> 0:4:29,208
into energy we can use.


81
0:4:29,208 --> 0:4:31,917
Doesn't take a genius to know
that a mirror reflects the Sun,


82
0:4:31,917 --> 0:4:33,583
but it does take an inventor


83
0:4:33,583 --> 0:4:36,83
and engineer
to make the next step.


84
0:4:36,83 --> 0:4:38,5
Use the mirror
to focus the Sun's rays


85
0:4:38,5 --> 0:4:41,375
on a tank filled
with liquid to make steam,


86
0:4:41,375 --> 0:4:43,875
to drive a turbine,
to make electricity,


87
0:4:43,875 --> 0:4:47,25
and you have
concentrated solar power.


88
0:4:47,25 --> 0:4:49,542
That's not a new idea,
but one that a little-known


89
0:4:49,542 --> 0:4:54,417
American inventor, Frank Shuman,
pursued around 1910.


90
0:4:54,417 --> 0:4:56,5
Narrator:
In his Philadelphia workshop,


91
0:4:56,5 --> 0:5:2,792
Shuman invented safety glass
for skylights and automobiles.


92
0:5:2,792 --> 0:5:5,542
He also came up with designs
that could concentrate sunlight


93
0:5:5,542 --> 0:5:9,792
on metal tubes, heat liquid,
and drive a steam turbine.


94
0:5:9,792 --> 0:5:14,25
But in Pennsylvania, back then,
it was all about coal.


95
0:5:14,25 --> 0:5:16,958
Shuman had difficulty finding
local backers.


96
0:5:16,958 --> 0:5:21,417
So in 1912 he set off
for Egypt.


97
0:5:21,417 --> 0:5:24,167
His prototype solar farm
used parabolic troughs


98
0:5:24,167 --> 0:5:27,417
to concentrate sunlight
and boil water.


99
0:5:27,417 --> 0:5:30,708
The steam ran a 75 horsepower
engine that pumped water


100
0:5:30,708 --> 0:5:33,917
from the Nile to irrigate
cotton fields.


101
0:5:33,917 --> 0:5:36,958
The idea was right,
but ahead of its time.


102
0:5:36,958 --> 0:5:39,42
Hobbled by both
lack of government support


103
0:5:39,42 --> 0:5:42,83
and adequate private capital,
the experiment ended


104
0:5:42,83 --> 0:5:51,917
with the outbreak
of World War One.


105
0:5:51,917 --> 0:5:54,208
These parabolic troughs
look very similar


106
0:5:54,208 --> 0:5:56,875
to Shumans' designs,
though they didn't come online


107
0:5:56,875 --> 0:5:59,0
until a century later.


108
0:5:59,0 --> 0:6:1,833
This is Solnova 3,
at one of the world's


109
0:6:1,833 --> 0:6:5,5
first commercial
solar power plants.


110
0:6:5,5 --> 0:6:8,125
Just as in Shuman's
experimental station,


111
0:6:8,125 --> 0:6:11,292
the troughs concentrate
solar radiation on a pipe


112
0:6:11,292 --> 0:6:14,375
that contains
a heat-bearing fluid.


113
0:6:14,375 --> 0:6:17,792
When completed there'll be
three almost identical plants,


114
0:6:17,792 --> 0:6:20,542
each with an output
of 50 megawatts,


115
0:6:20,542 --> 0:6:26,208
large enough to support
about 26,000 households.


116
0:6:26,208 --> 0:6:29,42
While the Sun powers
the Solucar platform, it was


117
0:6:29,42 --> 0:6:33,958
the Spanish government that
helped develop solar power.


118
0:6:33,958 --> 0:6:35,917
The central government
set a specific target


119
0:6:35,917 --> 0:6:39,875
of 500 megawatts
of concentrated solar power


120
0:6:39,875 --> 0:6:43,708
and committed to price supports
for 25 years.


121
0:6:43,708 --> 0:6:46,958
That in turn unleashed
inventors and industry


122
0:6:46,958 --> 0:6:49,625
to prototype plants
like this one.


123
0:6:49,625 --> 0:6:52,83
The technology works,
though changing government


124
0:6:52,83 --> 0:6:56,667
policies and the budget crisis
have impacted the industry.


125
0:6:56,667 --> 0:6:59,875
But, Abengoa,
the company building Solucar,


126
0:6:59,875 --> 0:7:2,208
is a part of a consortium
planning the world's largest


127
0:7:2,208 --> 0:7:5,708
solar power project.


128
0:7:5,708 --> 0:7:9,208
Formed by a group of European
and North African companies


129
0:7:9,208 --> 0:7:11,333
and the Desertec foundation,


130
0:7:11,333 --> 0:7:13,375
this consortium has energy
ambitions that are


131
0:7:13,375 --> 0:7:18,792
revolutionary for both Europe
and the Middle East.


132
0:7:18,792 --> 0:7:21,792
Unlike some of its neighbors,
Morocco has little oil


133
0:7:21,792 --> 0:7:25,875
or other fossil fuels.


134
0:7:25,875 --> 0:7:33,75
But it does have sun, sand,
and empty spaces.


135
0:7:33,75 --> 0:7:35,75
The Moroccan government has
encouraged the use


136
0:7:35,75 --> 0:7:37,375
of distributed solar power


137
0:7:37,375 --> 0:7:41,708
by small businesses
and individuals.


138
0:7:41,708 --> 0:7:43,958
Already, out on the edge
of the Sahara,


139
0:7:43,958 --> 0:7:48,125
you can see photovoltaic panels
on top of tents.


140
0:7:48,125 --> 0:7:50,5
But the Desertec vision
goes beyond this


141
0:7:50,5 --> 0:7:54,125
by including concentrated
solar power plants,


142
0:7:54,125 --> 0:7:57,625
photovoltaic installations,
and wind turbines,


143
0:7:57,625 --> 0:7:59,542
linked with low-loss,
high efficiency


144
0:7:59,542 --> 0:8:3,167
transmission cables
back to Europe.


145
0:8:3,167 --> 0:8:5,542
The Desertec project estimates
that solar power


146
0:8:5,542 --> 0:8:9,42
from the Sahara
could provide more than 80%


147
0:8:9,42 --> 0:8:10,542
of North Africa's needs,


148
0:8:10,542 --> 0:8:14,375
and 15% of Europe's
electricity, by 2050.


149
0:8:14,375 --> 0:8:18,125
In a single generation,
Morocco's young and growing


150
0:8:18,125 --> 0:8:20,917
population could go
from energy poverty


151
0:8:20,917 --> 0:8:23,25
to energy independence.


152
0:8:23,25 --> 0:8:25,458
The energy created by this
proven technology


153
0:8:25,458 --> 0:8:28,208
could generate
both electricity and income


154
0:8:28,208 --> 0:8:31,458
for some of the world's
poorest nations.


155
0:8:31,458 --> 0:8:35,83
And updated versions
of Shuman's century-old designs


156
0:8:35,83 --> 0:8:38,83
and a smart grid,
could go a very long way


157
0:8:38,83 --> 0:8:41,42
toward meeting our species'
need for energy.


158
0:8:41,42 --> 0:8:43,917
Collecting just 10%
of the Sun's energy


159
0:8:43,917 --> 0:8:47,542
from a 600-mile-square
of low-latitude desert would


160
0:8:47,542 --> 0:8:54,167
supply roughly twice today's
human consumption of energy.


161
0:8:54,167 --> 0:8:56,625
There are other ways
to harvest sunlight.


162
0:8:56,625 --> 0:8:59,667
It's estimated that biomass,
plants growing through


163
0:8:59,667 --> 0:9:4,0
photosynthesis, offers 11 times
current human energy use.


164
0:9:4,0 --> 0:9:6,375
And one nation has already
proven it's possible


165
0:9:6,375 --> 0:9:9,583
to Grow Your Own.


166
0:9:9,583 --> 0:9:13,375
In the United States, for every
thousand people, there are


167
0:9:13,375 --> 0:9:18,708
more than 800 motor vehicles--
cars, trucks and buses.


168
0:9:18,708 --> 0:9:21,833
If developing nations follow
that path, there'll soon be


169
0:9:21,833 --> 0:9:26,458
close to 6 billion motor
vehicles on the planet.


170
0:9:26,458 --> 0:9:28,5
And if they're burning
gasoline and diesel,


171
0:9:28,5 --> 0:9:30,5
they'll be pumping out
nearly 12 billion


172
0:9:30,5 --> 0:9:34,667
additional metric tons
of carbon dioxide every year,


173
0:9:34,667 --> 0:9:38,125
assuming there's enough oil
to keep them on the road.


174
0:9:38,125 --> 0:9:40,792
One nation doesn't
have that worry.


175
0:9:40,792 --> 0:9:43,708
Carlos de Brito Cruz:
If for some magical reason,


176
0:9:43,708 --> 0:9:48,583
every molecule of gasoline
in the world would disappear,


177
0:9:48,583 --> 0:9:51,833
I guess that the only country
that would keep


178
0:9:51,833 --> 0:9:56,25
its cars running normally
would be Brazil.


179
0:9:56,25 --> 0:9:58,5
Narrator:
That wasn't always true.


180
0:9:58,5 --> 0:10:0,667
As in every other
industrialized nation,


181
0:10:0,667 --> 0:10:3,0
the two oil shocks
of the 1970's


182
0:10:3,0 --> 0:10:6,42
brought gasoline shortages
to Brazil.


183
0:10:6,42 --> 0:10:8,833
Its government,
then a military dictatorship,


184
0:10:8,833 --> 0:10:12,375
decided to do something
revolutionary.


185
0:10:12,375 --> 0:10:14,917
Jose Goldemberg:
Military dictatorships are bad


186
0:10:14,917 --> 0:10:17,958
for many, many things,
but the military dictatorship


187
0:10:17,958 --> 0:10:21,167
in Brazil realized
that science and technology was


188
0:10:21,167 --> 0:10:25,583
an instrument for development,
for independence.


189
0:10:25,583 --> 0:10:27,833
Brito: In 1975,
the Brazilian government


190
0:10:27,833 --> 0:10:29,917
created the Pro-Alcohol,


191
0:10:29,917 --> 0:10:33,125
an ethanol substituting
gasoline program.


192
0:10:33,125 --> 0:10:34,583
Goldemberg: I think
it did it for nationalistic


193
0:10:34,583 --> 0:10:36,875
reasons, too, which was one


194
0:10:36,875 --> 0:10:39,417
of the characteristics
of military regimes.


195
0:10:39,417 --> 0:10:41,292
Narrator:
Although a nuclear physicist,


196
0:10:41,292 --> 0:10:44,667
Jose Goldemberg worked
with agricultural colleagues


197
0:10:44,667 --> 0:10:47,125
and wrote a paper
for the journal, Science, 


198
0:10:47,125 --> 0:10:49,375
proposing ethanol
made from sugar cane


199
0:10:49,375 --> 0:10:51,958
as an alternative
to imported gasoline.


200
0:10:51,958 --> 0:10:53,83
Goldemberg:
People were quite surprised


201
0:10:53,83 --> 0:10:54,875
that there were options
to gasoline, you know.


202
0:10:54,875 --> 0:10:58,125
Until that time,
gasoline dominated


203
0:10:58,125 --> 0:10:59,667
completely the picture.


204
0:10:59,667 --> 0:11:3,167
Brito: Producing alcohol
from sugar is something


205
0:11:3,167 --> 0:11:7,208
that humanity has done
for more than 3,000 years,


206
0:11:7,208 --> 0:11:9,792
so it's not really a new idea.


207
0:11:9,792 --> 0:11:11,667
Goldemberg:
Ethanol from sugar cane is


208
0:11:11,667 --> 0:11:17,0
really solar energy
turned into liquid.


209
0:11:17,0 --> 0:11:19,958
Sugar cane proved to be
the best raw material


210
0:11:19,958 --> 0:11:21,708
for the production of ethanol.


211
0:11:21,708 --> 0:11:24,167
That doesn't have to do
with Brazil


212
0:11:24,167 --> 0:11:25,792
or nationalism or anything.


213
0:11:25,792 --> 0:11:30,458
It has to do
with photosynthesis.


214
0:11:30,458 --> 0:11:32,0
Narrator: Though nature
may have blessed Brazil


215
0:11:32,0 --> 0:11:35,125
with rain and sunshine,
it took high-level policy


216
0:11:35,125 --> 0:11:39,42
and investment for this nation
to grow its own fuel supply.


217
0:11:39,42 --> 0:11:41,708
Goldemberg: That took a decision
from the government.


218
0:11:41,708 --> 0:11:43,917
So it was not only
natural resources,


219
0:11:43,917 --> 0:11:47,583
but a deliberate attempt
by the government


220
0:11:47,583 --> 0:11:50,167
which created the conditions
to do that.


221
0:11:50,167 --> 0:11:52,917
Of course, in the beginning
ethanol was expensive.


222
0:11:52,917 --> 0:11:54,542
And the government
understood that.


223
0:11:54,542 --> 0:11:56,917
But everybody knows
that in the beginning,


224
0:11:56,917 --> 0:11:58,625
technologies are expensive.


225
0:11:58,625 --> 0:12:0,5
Automobiles were very expensive


226
0:12:0,5 --> 0:12:4,917
when Ford came into the game.


227
0:12:4,917 --> 0:12:7,542
Narrator:
And, more or less, it worked.


228
0:12:7,542 --> 0:12:9,5
Goldemberg:
For 10 years, then,


229
0:12:9,5 --> 0:12:11,375
Brazil was the only country
in the world


230
0:12:11,375 --> 0:12:15,875
that had automobiles
that could use 100% ethanol.


231
0:12:15,875 --> 0:12:20,42
That required a complete
distribution system


232
0:12:20,42 --> 0:12:21,542
for pure ethanol.


233
0:12:21,542 --> 0:12:24,792
Brito: And at some point,
by the end of the 80s,


234
0:12:24,792 --> 0:12:30,208
most of the cars
were pure ethanol cars.


235
0:12:30,208 --> 0:12:32,875
Narrator: Manufacturers
like GM Brazil responded,


236
0:12:32,875 --> 0:12:37,25
and tooled up to support
pure ethanol.


237
0:12:37,25 --> 0:12:38,542
Henrique Basilio Pereira:
We were selling


238
0:12:38,542 --> 0:12:44,417
about 97% of our cars during
that period, on ethanol.


239
0:12:44,417 --> 0:12:46,417
Narrator:
Then oil prices crashed,


240
0:12:46,417 --> 0:12:51,75
and subsidizing ethanol
no longer seemed so wise.


241
0:12:51,75 --> 0:12:55,42
But Brazil was still
a major sugar producer.


242
0:12:55,42 --> 0:12:58,625
Could engineering innovations
find some way to build cars


243
0:12:58,625 --> 0:13:1,917
that could use either
gasoline or ethanol?


244
0:13:1,917 --> 0:13:3,208
Pereira:
In the end of the 80s,


245
0:13:3,208 --> 0:13:4,792
beginning of the 90s,
we started thinking


246
0:13:4,792 --> 0:13:8,125
about having a car
that could run on both fuels.


247
0:13:8,125 --> 0:13:10,792
But during that period
we did not have


248
0:13:10,792 --> 0:13:14,25
a technology sufficient
to run a flex car.


249
0:13:14,25 --> 0:13:16,0
Narrator:
A new kind of dual-fuel engine


250
0:13:16,0 --> 0:13:18,375
had already been invented
in the United States,


251
0:13:18,375 --> 0:13:20,875
back in the 1980s.


252
0:13:20,875 --> 0:13:24,708
But in 2003, the first
mass-produced flex car,


253
0:13:24,708 --> 0:13:27,917
a VW Gol, rolled off
production lines


254
0:13:27,917 --> 0:13:31,542
not in the U.S.,
but in Brazil.


255
0:13:31,542 --> 0:13:33,167
Once again,
the Brazilian government,


256
0:13:33,167 --> 0:13:36,0
by now civilian,
had stepped in.


257
0:13:36,0 --> 0:13:39,958
Brito:
In 2002 the Brazilian government


258
0:13:39,958 --> 0:13:45,542
organized an initiative
for reducing taxes


259
0:13:45,542 --> 0:13:49,917
for the automakers if they
would make Flex-fuel cars.


260
0:13:49,917 --> 0:13:52,917
So you see the government policy
reversed and changed,


261
0:13:52,917 --> 0:13:56,792
and still the policy worked.


262
0:13:56,792 --> 0:13:59,25
Narrator: And once again,
natural resources


263
0:13:59,25 --> 0:14:2,42
and human planning
came together.


264
0:14:2,42 --> 0:14:3,917
Pereira: Here
at General Motors de Brasil,


265
0:14:3,917 --> 0:14:6,125
we are producing, right now,
a hundred percent


266
0:14:6,125 --> 0:14:9,625
of the passenger cars
as flex fuel.


267
0:14:9,625 --> 0:14:10,875
Narrator:
Now Brazilian consumers


268
0:14:10,875 --> 0:14:13,792
have a choice,
trading off the higher cost,


269
0:14:13,792 --> 0:14:16,542
but higher energy
of a tank-full of gasoline,


270
0:14:16,542 --> 0:14:20,83
against the lower cost,
but lower energy of ethanol.


271
0:14:20,83 --> 0:14:23,875
Brito:
And 95% of the automobiles


272
0:14:23,875 --> 0:14:28,83
sold every month in Brazil
are Flex fuel cars.


273
0:14:28,83 --> 0:14:31,583
That makes Brazil
a very unique country


274
0:14:31,583 --> 0:14:34,25
in terms
of substituting gasoline.


275
0:14:34,25 --> 0:14:38,333
Brazil, last year,
used more liters of ethanol


276
0:14:38,333 --> 0:14:39,833
than liters of gasoline.


277
0:14:39,833 --> 0:14:45,167
So it's not a small experiment,
it's a large experiment.


278
0:14:45,167 --> 0:14:47,292
Narrator: Brazilian researchers
claim they could expand


279
0:14:47,292 --> 0:14:50,542
their nation's production
of biofuel ten times over,


280
0:14:50,542 --> 0:14:54,333
using only abandoned farmland
and under-utilized pastures,


281
0:14:54,333 --> 0:14:57,917
while still protecting
the nation's forests.


282
0:14:57,917 --> 0:15:0,917
Brito:
Biofuels will only be


283
0:15:0,917 --> 0:15:6,25
a sustainable alternative,
not only if they do not compete


284
0:15:6,25 --> 0:15:9,958
with the production
of food, but also


285
0:15:9,958 --> 0:15:15,458
if they do not cause harm
to the environment.


286
0:15:15,458 --> 0:15:17,917
Narrator: Looking back, it
may seem like a straight path


287
0:15:17,917 --> 0:15:21,625
from imported oil
to energy independence,


288
0:15:21,625 --> 0:15:25,542
but the Proalcool program was
an on-again, off-again process,


289
0:15:25,542 --> 0:15:30,5
before ending up with Flex cars
using flex fuels.


290
0:15:30,5 --> 0:15:33,375
What was constant
was a nation focusing


291
0:15:33,375 --> 0:15:37,42
on its unique capabilities
and natural resources,


292
0:15:37,42 --> 0:15:41,208
assets that inevitably vary
nation by nation.


293
0:15:41,208 --> 0:15:44,375
For Jose Goldemberg, present at
the creation of the push


294
0:15:44,375 --> 0:15:49,125
for sugar-cane ethanol,
the story has one main lesson.


295
0:15:49,125 --> 0:15:51,583
Goldemberg:
You have to adopt a solution,


296
0:15:51,583 --> 0:15:54,667
and then have the courage
to stick to it.


297
0:15:54,667 --> 0:15:56,42
Narrator:
Are there other examples


298
0:15:56,42 --> 0:15:57,917
of communities and nations
that have begun


299
0:15:57,917 --> 0:16:1,333
the transition away
from fossil fuels?


300
0:16:1,333 --> 0:16:3,917
What does it take to welcome
the turbines and solar farms


301
0:16:3,917 --> 0:16:12,917
of the new energy system,
and say, "Yes, In My Backyard."


302
0:16:12,917 --> 0:16:15,0
This is the story
of two communities


303
0:16:15,0 --> 0:16:19,625
that at first
look very different.


304
0:16:19,625 --> 0:16:23,458
Samso is a small island
off the Danish mainland.


305
0:16:23,458 --> 0:16:28,208
West Texas is a vast, dry
expanse in America's South.


306
0:16:28,208 --> 0:16:31,458
What both have
is abundant wind.


307
0:16:31,458 --> 0:16:35,667
At times, Samso produces more
electricity than it uses,


308
0:16:35,667 --> 0:16:39,625
exporting surplus power
to the Danish mainland.


309
0:16:39,625 --> 0:16:42,458
And Texas wind now generates
as much power


310
0:16:42,458 --> 0:16:45,917
as the next three
U.S. states combined.


311
0:16:45,917 --> 0:16:48,292
Samso and West Texas
both solved


312
0:16:48,292 --> 0:16:51,417
the NIMBY,
not in my backyard challenge


313
0:16:51,417 --> 0:16:55,625
that has stymied so many
renewable energy projects.


314
0:16:55,625 --> 0:16:59,167
It's not easy, but
with patience, and persistence,


315
0:16:59,167 --> 0:17:3,5
and the efforts of the right
people, it can be done.


316
0:17:3,5 --> 0:17:6,667
Soren: Okay--
My name is Soren Hermansen,


317
0:17:6,667 --> 0:17:11,208
and I am the Director
of the Samso Energy Academy.


318
0:17:11,208 --> 0:17:14,917
Samso means, in Danish,
means the Meeting Island--


319
0:17:14,917 --> 0:17:16,583
when you make a circle
around all of Denmark,


320
0:17:16,583 --> 0:17:20,375
then Samso is right
in the center of the circle.


321
0:17:20,375 --> 0:17:21,792
Narrator:
But it wasn't geography


322
0:17:21,792 --> 0:17:24,375
that brought Lykke Friis,
then Denmark's Minister


323
0:17:24,375 --> 0:17:29,375
of Climate and Energy,
here in mid-2011.


324
0:17:29,375 --> 0:17:32,792
It was why and how this
community had turned NIMBY


325
0:17:32,792 --> 0:17:35,708
into "Yes, in my backyard."


326
0:17:35,708 --> 0:17:39,125
Lykke Friis: Well,
Samso is a pioneering project,


327
0:17:39,125 --> 0:17:42,917
in the sense that Samso,
way back, decided


328
0:17:42,917 --> 0:17:47,708
that Samso should become
independent of fossil fuels.


329
0:17:47,708 --> 0:17:49,25
Narrator:
Before its transformation,


330
0:17:49,25 --> 0:17:53,375
people thought of Samso as just
a cute tourist community,


331
0:17:53,375 --> 0:17:58,25
busy in summer,
empty and desolate in winter.


332
0:17:58,25 --> 0:18:1,208
Now people come here
not just to see the turbines,


333
0:18:1,208 --> 0:18:3,542
but to understand
the process that got


334
0:18:3,542 --> 0:18:7,375
the community
to welcome wind energy.


335
0:18:7,375 --> 0:18:10,208
After a national competition,
Samso was selected


336
0:18:10,208 --> 0:18:12,667
by the Danish government
to be a proof of concept


337
0:18:12,667 --> 0:18:16,583
for how to transition
from fossil fuels.


338
0:18:16,583 --> 0:18:19,625
But it was up to individuals
like Soren Hermansen,


339
0:18:19,625 --> 0:18:22,25
with the passion and skills
to effect change,


340
0:18:22,25 --> 0:18:24,458
to figure out just how.


341
0:18:24,458 --> 0:18:26,667
Soren: So when we won,
the normal reaction


342
0:18:26,667 --> 0:18:29,208
from most people was,
"Yeah, you can do this project,


343
0:18:29,208 --> 0:18:32,25
that's OK,
but just leave me out of it."


344
0:18:32,25 --> 0:18:34,375
Narrator:
Samso has a deep attachment


345
0:18:34,375 --> 0:18:38,667
to its past and values
its traditional way of life.


346
0:18:38,667 --> 0:18:41,708
Soren: But gradually
we won their confidence


347
0:18:41,708 --> 0:18:45,875
in establishing easy projects
to understand,


348
0:18:45,875 --> 0:18:48,83
and also easy projects
to finance.


349
0:18:48,83 --> 0:18:51,875
Because basically it's all
about, "What's in it for me?"


350
0:18:51,875 --> 0:18:55,42
Because it's not
convinced idealists


351
0:18:55,42 --> 0:18:58,542
or green environmental
hippies who lives here.


352
0:18:58,542 --> 0:19:0,75
Narrator:
Soren, a native of the island,


353
0:19:0,75 --> 0:19:4,25
convinced some of his neighbors
to become early adopters.


354
0:19:4,25 --> 0:19:7,875
They found success,
and spread the word.


355
0:19:7,875 --> 0:19:9,917
Jorgen Tranberg
operated a large


356
0:19:9,917 --> 0:19:14,667
and profitable herd
of milk cows.


357
0:19:14,667 --> 0:19:17,333
After initial reservations,
he invested


358
0:19:17,333 --> 0:19:20,5
in a turbine on his own land.


359
0:19:20,5 --> 0:19:22,958
When that went well,
Jorgen became part owner


360
0:19:22,958 --> 0:19:25,833
of one of the offshore
turbines.


361
0:19:25,833 --> 0:19:27,5
Soren:
Farmers, they have to invent


362
0:19:27,5 --> 0:19:30,917
new things and be ready
for changes.


363
0:19:30,917 --> 0:19:32,917
So when they see a potential,
they look at it,


364
0:19:32,917 --> 0:19:34,25
no matter what it is.


365
0:19:34,25 --> 0:19:35,875
They look at it, say,
"Could I do this?"


366
0:19:35,875 --> 0:19:38,583
And if they see fellow farmers
do the same thing,


367
0:19:38,583 --> 0:19:41,292
they are quick
to respond to that.


368
0:19:41,292 --> 0:19:44,83
So even being very traditional
and conservative in their heads


369
0:19:44,83 --> 0:19:47,292
I think they have this ability
of making moves and do things,


370
0:19:47,292 --> 0:19:49,417
because they have this
independency in them.


371
0:19:49,417 --> 0:19:52,667
A farmer is a free man--
maybe he owes a lot of money


372
0:19:52,667 --> 0:19:56,458
to the bank, but he's still
a free man in his thinking.


373
0:19:56,458 --> 0:19:57,625
Narrator:
It was seeing what was


374
0:19:57,625 --> 0:19:59,792
in it for them
and for their community,


375
0:19:59,792 --> 0:20:3,625
that won over landowners
in West Texas.


376
0:20:3,625 --> 0:20:5,875
And it took one of their own,
a man whose family


377
0:20:5,875 --> 0:20:8,667
had deep roots
in Roscoe's cotton fields,


378
0:20:8,667 --> 0:20:11,417
to educate them
about wind farming.


379
0:20:11,417 --> 0:20:15,708
Cliff Etheredge: Well, I'm
really a farmer-farmer, you see.


380
0:20:15,708 --> 0:20:19,417
I farmed for almost
over 40 years.


381
0:20:19,417 --> 0:20:23,0
We're in-- right in the middle
of the Roscoe Wind Farm.


382
0:20:23,0 --> 0:20:26,833
And we've got
about 780 megawatts


383
0:20:26,833 --> 0:20:29,208
of production,
that's per hour,


384
0:20:29,208 --> 0:20:36,0
enough electricity
for about 265,000 average homes.


385
0:20:36,0 --> 0:20:38,417
Narrator: Roscoe had no oil
and faced hard times


386
0:20:38,417 --> 0:20:42,708
in the early 90's,
but it did have wind.


387
0:20:42,708 --> 0:20:44,125
Cliff:
When this land was acquired


388
0:20:44,125 --> 0:20:47,167
there was absolutely
no value to the wind.


389
0:20:47,167 --> 0:20:49,958
Fact is, it was
a severe detriment,


390
0:20:49,958 --> 0:20:54,792
because of the evaporation
of the moisture.


391
0:20:54,792 --> 0:20:57,42
Narrator:
Cliff, like Soren, had to work


392
0:20:57,42 --> 0:21:1,417
with his neighbors to get them
ready to accept wind turbines.


393
0:21:1,417 --> 0:21:3,5
Cliff: The first thing
farmers want to know is,


394
0:21:3,5 --> 0:21:5,667
"Well, how much is it going
to cost me?"


395
0:21:5,667 --> 0:21:7,458
It costs them nothing.


396
0:21:7,458 --> 0:21:10,25
"What's it going to hurt?"
Three to five percent


397
0:21:10,25 --> 0:21:13,292
of your farmland
is all it's going to take up.


398
0:21:13,292 --> 0:21:16,83
You can do what you want to
with the rest of it.


399
0:21:16,83 --> 0:21:18,833
Then it came down to,
"Well, how much money


400
0:21:18,833 --> 0:21:21,125
is this going to make me?"


401
0:21:21,125 --> 0:21:22,583
Narrator: Cliff did his
research and checked


402
0:21:22,583 --> 0:21:25,792
his numbers with wind
experts and the Farm Bureau.


403
0:21:25,792 --> 0:21:27,42
Cliff:
Then I was able to go


404
0:21:27,42 --> 0:21:29,792
to our Landowners' Association
and show them,


405
0:21:29,792 --> 0:21:34,0
where they had been receiving
35 to 40 dollars an acre,


406
0:21:34,0 --> 0:21:36,125
then the landowners
could expect somewhere


407
0:21:36,125 --> 0:21:38,708
in the neighborhood
of three times that.


408
0:21:38,708 --> 0:21:40,833
Narrator:
In fact, farmers stand to make


409
0:21:40,833 --> 0:21:44,125
10 to 15 thousand dollars
a year, per turbine,


410
0:21:44,125 --> 0:21:46,625
just from leasing
the wind rights.


411
0:21:46,625 --> 0:21:48,167
Cliff:
There was no guarantees in it


412
0:21:48,167 --> 0:21:51,42
from the very beginning,
but sure enough we've got,


413
0:21:51,42 --> 0:21:55,0
I think, in the neighborhood
of 95 or more percent


414
0:21:55,0 --> 0:21:59,875
of our area that accepted
the wind farm.


415
0:21:59,875 --> 0:22:2,208
Narrator:
In both Samso and West Texas,


416
0:22:2,208 --> 0:22:4,917
individuals saw
economic benefits.


417
0:22:4,917 --> 0:22:7,458
But the whole community,
beyond the investors


418
0:22:7,458 --> 0:22:11,708
and land-owners,
benefited too.


419
0:22:11,708 --> 0:22:14,42
Cliff:
Because of the wind farm, now,


420
0:22:14,42 --> 0:22:16,25
and the people working
in the wind industry,


421
0:22:16,25 --> 0:22:18,667
now we've got jobs available
and opportunities


422
0:22:18,667 --> 0:22:22,125
for young people to come back
from college


423
0:22:22,125 --> 0:22:25,5
or from technical school
or from whatever.


424
0:22:25,5 --> 0:22:29,542
It's just been a Godsend.


425
0:22:29,542 --> 0:22:30,75
Narrator:
For Kim Alexander,


426
0:22:30,75 --> 0:22:33,333
superintendent
of the Roscoe school district,


427
0:22:33,333 --> 0:22:36,5
that godsend translates
into dollars.


428
0:22:36,5 --> 0:22:40,333
Kim Alexander: In 2007,
prior to the wind values


429
0:22:40,333 --> 0:22:43,83
coming on our tax roll,
our property values


430
0:22:43,83 --> 0:22:45,458
were at about $65 million.


431
0:22:45,458 --> 0:22:48,375
And then, that wind
development, they jumped


432
0:22:48,375 --> 0:22:52,75
to approximately $400 million,
to $465 million.


433
0:22:52,75 --> 0:22:54,0
Narrator:
The school district will get


434
0:22:54,0 --> 0:22:57,292
more than $10 million dollars
over a decade.


435
0:22:57,292 --> 0:23:1,625
That guaranteed revenue stream
unlocked additional funding.


436
0:23:1,625 --> 0:23:4,208
School buildings,
some dating from the 1930's,


437
0:23:4,208 --> 0:23:7,375
could be updated,
and computer labs added.


438
0:23:7,375 --> 0:23:9,375
Cliff:
This is an indication to me


439
0:23:9,375 --> 0:23:12,833
of what can be done for rural
areas, and will be done,


440
0:23:12,833 --> 0:23:17,917
all the way to Canada--
bringing life and prosperity


441
0:23:17,917 --> 0:23:20,208
back to these
rural communities


442
0:23:20,208 --> 0:23:23,625
that are suffering just
like we have.


443
0:23:23,625 --> 0:23:24,792
Narrator:
The same oil shock


444
0:23:24,792 --> 0:23:26,583
that got Brazil
started on ethanol,


445
0:23:26,583 --> 0:23:29,708
got Denmark started
on manufacturing wind turbines,


446
0:23:29,708 --> 0:23:31,625
just in time
to compensate for a decline


447
0:23:31,625 --> 0:23:34,75
in its ship-building industry.


448
0:23:34,75 --> 0:23:35,917
Lykke:
And it's also good


449
0:23:35,917 --> 0:23:37,417
for the economy,
in terms of export.


450
0:23:37,417 --> 0:23:42,375
I mean, 10% of Danish exports
comes from the cleantech area.


451
0:23:42,375 --> 0:23:44,375
Narrator: Energy
and environment always require


452
0:23:44,375 --> 0:23:49,5
tradeoffs, such as clear vistas
versus clean energy.


453
0:23:49,5 --> 0:23:50,667
It's something
that communities


454
0:23:50,667 --> 0:23:54,333
have to make time
to work through.


455
0:23:54,333 --> 0:23:57,667
Cliff, for one,
believes it's worth it.


456
0:23:57,667 --> 0:23:58,958
Cliff:
Everything, the schools,


457
0:23:58,958 --> 0:24:1,833
the churches,
the civic organizations,


458
0:24:1,833 --> 0:24:4,792
all the businesses
will benefit from this.


459
0:24:4,792 --> 0:24:8,792
It will increase, hopefully,
our town's populations,


460
0:24:8,792 --> 0:24:11,625
and our economics.


461
0:24:11,625 --> 0:24:14,667
Kim Alexander: 
My granddad used to say,


462
0:24:14,667 --> 0:24:16,167
not realizing
he was prophetic,


463
0:24:16,167 --> 0:24:20,42
but "If we could sell the wind,
we'd be wealthy."


464
0:24:20,42 --> 0:24:21,5
Well, who would
have ever thought


465
0:24:21,5 --> 0:24:23,75
we'd be able to sell the wind?


466
0:24:23,75 --> 0:24:27,208
Narrator:
For Samso, Denmark and Texas,


467
0:24:27,208 --> 0:24:31,417
clean energy brought economic
benefits and energy security.


468
0:24:31,417 --> 0:24:34,83
But replacing fossil fuel
emissions with wind power


469
0:24:34,83 --> 0:24:36,708
has other advantages.


470
0:24:36,708 --> 0:24:37,917
Lykke:
And let's not forget,


471
0:24:37,917 --> 0:24:40,542
also good for climate
and health, and such,


472
0:24:40,542 --> 0:24:42,83
and that's a very
important argument.


473
0:24:42,83 --> 0:24:46,208
Cliff: We've got a constant
wind resource here,


474
0:24:46,208 --> 0:24:51,375
that's tremendously valuable,
and as opposed to oil and gas,


475
0:24:51,375 --> 0:24:57,375
it'll last forever,
and it doesn't pollute anything.


476
0:24:57,375 --> 0:24:58,583
Narrator:
Burning fossil fuel


477
0:24:58,583 --> 0:25:0,75
emits black soot
and other pollutants


478
0:25:0,75 --> 0:25:3,75
that fall out of the atmosphere
quite quickly.


479
0:25:3,75 --> 0:25:6,333
But it also releases carbon
dioxide, which remains


480
0:25:6,333 --> 0:25:11,458
in the air much longer,
to influence Earth's climate.


481
0:25:11,458 --> 0:25:14,125
Richard Alley's ice core
research shows that sometimes


482
0:25:14,125 --> 0:25:16,875
the Earth experiences
abrupt climate changes,


483
0:25:16,875 --> 0:25:19,833
known as tipping points.


484
0:25:19,833 --> 0:25:21,583
And if we keep on
burning fossil fuels


485
0:25:21,583 --> 0:25:24,917
without capturing CO2
emissions, we may increase


486
0:25:24,917 --> 0:25:29,167
the risk of pushing Earth's
climate over the edge.


487
0:25:29,167 --> 0:25:34,42
It might be wise
to Look Before You Leap.


488
0:25:34,42 --> 0:25:35,208
Richard Alley:
The Earth's climate system


489
0:25:35,208 --> 0:25:37,5
is usually well-behaved--


490
0:25:37,5 --> 0:25:40,292
a little more Sun,
a little more CO2,


491
0:25:40,292 --> 0:25:43,25
and we get a predictable
amount of warming.


492
0:25:43,25 --> 0:25:46,292
This is the pattern of natural
variability of the climate


493
0:25:46,292 --> 0:25:50,375
our planet has experienced over
the past 400 thousand years,


494
0:25:50,375 --> 0:25:53,792
as recorded in the physics
and chemistry of ice cores.


495
0:25:53,792 --> 0:25:56,875
The regular ups and downs
in temperature are the result


496
0:25:56,875 --> 0:25:59,708
of changes in Earth's orbit
around the Sun,


497
0:25:59,708 --> 0:26:2,458
and their subsequent effects
on levels of carbon dioxide


498
0:26:2,458 --> 0:26:5,375
and other heat-trapping gases.


499
0:26:5,375 --> 0:26:7,458
You can think
of this natural variation


500
0:26:7,458 --> 0:26:10,417
as the Ice Age roller coaster.


501
0:26:10,417 --> 0:26:14,542
As a geologist, I'm at home
in the vast expanses of time.


502
0:26:14,542 --> 0:26:17,583
So let's take a ride,
cresting hills


503
0:26:17,583 --> 0:26:19,542
and rolling through valleys,


504
0:26:19,542 --> 0:26:21,833
following the more-or-less
regular pattern


505
0:26:21,833 --> 0:26:26,25
of changing climate, over
hundreds of thousands of years.


506
0:26:26,25 --> 0:26:30,292
Here we're down at 180 parts
per million of CO2,


507
0:26:30,292 --> 0:26:33,75
and in an Ice Age.


508
0:26:33,75 --> 0:26:36,875
Now we're climbing
to 280 parts per million,


509
0:26:36,875 --> 0:26:40,125
a warmer interglacial period.


510
0:26:40,125 --> 0:26:45,208
Then down to a cold 180
and up again, to a warmer 280.


511
0:26:45,208 --> 0:26:49,792
Then repeating 180-280,
the natural cycling


512
0:26:49,792 --> 0:26:53,583
of the climate roller coaster.


513
0:26:53,583 --> 0:26:56,792
But if we look in greater
detail at 100,000 years


514
0:26:56,792 --> 0:26:59,83
of Earth history,
and specifically


515
0:26:59,83 --> 0:27:1,292
at the ice core record
from Greenland,


516
0:27:1,292 --> 0:27:3,75
it's obvious our planet's
climate hasn't always


517
0:27:3,75 --> 0:27:9,333
had smooth ups and downs.


518
0:27:9,333 --> 0:27:11,667
Occasionally,
we cross some sort


519
0:27:11,667 --> 0:27:14,0
of a tipping point,
and the Earth evolves


520
0:27:14,0 --> 0:27:18,42
really rapidly to a new state
which is very different.


521
0:27:18,42 --> 0:27:21,708
Over the last 100,000 years
of the Ice Age cycling,


522
0:27:21,708 --> 0:27:25,0
we've had a couple of dozen
of these large, abrupt,


523
0:27:25,0 --> 0:27:29,0
widespread climate shifts,
almost as if the Earth


524
0:27:29,0 --> 0:27:38,208
was bungy-jumping
off the climate roller coaster.


525
0:27:38,208 --> 0:27:40,25
Of course, you'd have
to be a little nuts


526
0:27:40,25 --> 0:27:43,42
to bungy off a roller coaster.


527
0:27:43,42 --> 0:27:49,583
Which is why I'm leaving this
to my computer avatar.


528
0:27:49,583 --> 0:27:53,167
But these abrupt climate
changes are real.


529
0:27:53,167 --> 0:27:57,0
Here's one of the largest
and most recent.


530
0:27:57,0 --> 0:28:0,833
About 13,000 years ago, as the
Earth was climbing out


531
0:28:0,833 --> 0:28:4,0
of the last Ice Age,
the North passed a tipping


532
0:28:4,0 --> 0:28:7,417
point and rapidly slid back
into a cold millennium--


533
0:28:7,417 --> 0:28:11,667
drying monsoon regions
of Asia where huge populations


534
0:28:11,667 --> 0:28:16,125
now rely on rain,
and warming the South.


535
0:28:16,125 --> 0:28:20,458
There was weather and climate
disruption world-wide.


536
0:28:20,458 --> 0:28:23,375
But then, another
tipping point was reached,


537
0:28:23,375 --> 0:28:26,542
and in ten years or so,
temperatures in Greenland rose


538
0:28:26,542 --> 0:28:31,625
by about 10 degrees Centigrade,
18 Fahrenheit--


539
0:28:31,625 --> 0:28:33,25
numbers we know
with high confidence


540
0:28:33,25 --> 0:28:35,833
from the ice core record.


541
0:28:35,833 --> 0:28:39,458
Today, whatever climate model
we use to project the impact


542
0:28:39,458 --> 0:28:44,5
of rising levels of CO2, you
see a relatively smooth curve,


543
0:28:44,5 --> 0:28:46,25
heading upward,
but in principle


544
0:28:46,25 --> 0:28:48,917
a change we could adapt to.


545
0:28:48,917 --> 0:28:51,375
But Earth's history shows us
that Earth's climate


546
0:28:51,375 --> 0:28:54,708
doesn't always work this way.


547
0:28:54,708 --> 0:28:58,542
Sometimes it really does get
as crazy and unpredictable


548
0:28:58,542 --> 0:29:10,125
as bungy jumping off
the climate roller coaster.


549
0:29:10,125 --> 0:29:13,458
An abrupt climate change could
be really bad for people.


550
0:29:13,458 --> 0:29:17,792
We're optimistic that we won't
have one, but we're not certain.


551
0:29:17,792 --> 0:29:20,708
And the science suggests
that the harder and faster


552
0:29:20,708 --> 0:29:23,917
we turn the CO2 knob,
the more likely we are


553
0:29:23,917 --> 0:29:28,375
to cross a tipping point
and trigger one.


554
0:29:28,375 --> 0:29:33,42
Yet here we are today, racing
up a hill to who knows where.


555
0:29:33,42 --> 0:29:35,75
As burning fossil fuels
means we've blown past


556
0:29:35,75 --> 0:29:40,208
390 parts per million,
without slowing down.


557
0:29:40,208 --> 0:29:42,833
Will our ascent be smooth
and manageable?


558
0:29:42,833 --> 0:29:46,375
Or will our ride
come off the rails?


559
0:29:46,375 --> 0:29:49,25
If we wanted
to take out insurance


560
0:29:49,25 --> 0:29:52,0
against the possibility
of such a change,


561
0:29:52,0 --> 0:29:59,458
we could look at slowing down
now before we tip over the edge.


562
0:29:59,458 --> 0:30:1,833
Narrator: One way of ensuring
a more manageable climate


563
0:30:1,833 --> 0:30:4,625
is to research and deploy ways
to burn fossil fuels


564
0:30:4,625 --> 0:30:9,42
without releasing massive
amounts of carbon dioxide.


565
0:30:9,42 --> 0:30:12,5
And, surprising as it may be,
some of the most innovative


566
0:30:12,5 --> 0:30:16,125
work to meet that urgent 21st
century goal is happening


567
0:30:16,125 --> 0:30:24,42
in the land of one of Earth's
most ancient empires.


568
0:30:24,42 --> 0:30:26,958
China was first unified
as a nation


569
0:30:26,958 --> 0:30:30,208
in the 3rd century B.C.
by the Emperor who had this


570
0:30:30,208 --> 0:30:35,167
army of Terracotta Warriors
built to guard his tomb.


571
0:30:35,167 --> 0:30:38,208
These figures represent state
control, and mass production


572
0:30:38,208 --> 0:30:42,917
in the service of a master
plan, extending from this life


573
0:30:42,917 --> 0:30:46,83
into the hereafter.


574
0:30:46,83 --> 0:30:48,75
This is a wonder
of the ancient world.


575
0:30:48,75 --> 0:30:50,125
But when China
wanted to showcase


576
0:30:50,125 --> 0:30:53,417
its National Treasures
for a contemporary audience,


577
0:30:53,417 --> 0:30:55,958
it placed one of the Emperors'
majestic chariots


578
0:30:55,958 --> 0:31:2,417
as a centerpiece at the 2010
Shanghai World EXPO.


579
0:31:2,417 --> 0:31:4,125
This EXPO, however,
was focused more


580
0:31:4,125 --> 0:31:8,208
on the future than the past.


581
0:31:8,208 --> 0:31:10,625
One entire floor of the massive
Chinese pavilion


582
0:31:10,625 --> 0:31:15,208
was devoted to renewable energy
and low-carbon living.


583
0:31:15,208 --> 0:31:17,375
Here there was no doubt
that CO2 emissions


584
0:31:17,375 --> 0:31:20,25
were driving climate change.


585
0:31:20,25 --> 0:31:24,583
And that clean energy
was the solution.


586
0:31:24,583 --> 0:31:27,583
All World's Fairs are exercises
in self-promotion,


587
0:31:27,583 --> 0:31:32,792
if not propaganda-- but hard
numbers tell the story.


588
0:31:32,792 --> 0:31:35,708
In 2010 China invested
more on renewable energy


589
0:31:35,708 --> 0:31:38,375
than any other nation
on Earth.


590
0:31:38,375 --> 0:31:41,917
Germany was number 2,
and the U.S., number 3,


591
0:31:41,917 --> 0:31:44,417
committing roughly half
as much as China.


592
0:31:44,417 --> 0:31:45,583
Julio Friedman:
China's being aggressive


593
0:31:45,583 --> 0:31:47,167
on all the clean energy fronts.


594
0:31:47,167 --> 0:31:49,42
They're building
100,000 megawatts of wind.


595
0:31:49,42 --> 0:31:51,625
They're putting up 10,000
megawatts of solar PV--


596
0:31:51,625 --> 0:31:54,667
50,000 megawatts of nuclear.


597
0:31:54,667 --> 0:31:56,167
Narrator: At the U.S.
Department of Energy's


598
0:31:56,167 --> 0:31:59,458
Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory in California,


599
0:31:59,458 --> 0:32:1,125
geoscientist Julio Friedman


600
0:32:1,125 --> 0:32:5,292
is in charge of its
Carbon Management Program.


601
0:32:5,292 --> 0:32:7,792
He uses some of the world's
fastest supercomputers


602
0:32:7,792 --> 0:32:11,292
to study how to store CO2
underground.


603
0:32:11,292 --> 0:32:15,167
And he's an expert on
U.S.-China energy collaboration


604
0:32:15,167 --> 0:32:16,333
Julio: They're not
putting all their eggs


605
0:32:16,333 --> 0:32:17,583
in one basket, either.


606
0:32:17,583 --> 0:32:20,42
They're trying to cover,
comprehensively,


607
0:32:20,42 --> 0:32:22,125
all the clean energy options.


608
0:32:22,125 --> 0:32:24,792
Narrator: And that includes
an old and dirty fuel that


609
0:32:24,792 --> 0:32:29,708
China both mines and imports
at world-record levels.


610
0:32:29,708 --> 0:32:31,667
Julio: China is the
world's largest coal producer.


611
0:32:31,667 --> 0:32:33,875
It's the world's
largest coal user.


612
0:32:33,875 --> 0:32:43,625
They're not going to abandon
coal any time soon.


613
0:32:43,625 --> 0:32:45,125
Narrator:
The city of Xi'an is home


614
0:32:45,125 --> 0:32:47,125
to the Terracotta Warriors,
and was once


615
0:32:47,125 --> 0:32:51,5
the capital of China, starting
point for the Silk Road.


616
0:32:51,5 --> 0:32:54,333
Now, it's a modern city
that illustrates the forces


617
0:32:54,333 --> 0:32:57,333
that will shape
China's energy future--


618
0:32:57,333 --> 0:33:1,708
and, inevitably,
impact the entire planet.


619
0:33:1,708 --> 0:33:3,75
Xi'an is also home
to the Thermal Power


620
0:33:3,75 --> 0:33:7,5
Research Institute, T-P-R-I.


621
0:33:7,5 --> 0:33:10,708
Thermal power in China
is shorthand for coal,


622
0:33:10,708 --> 0:33:14,333
which supplies 3/4ths of this
nation's electricity supply.


623
0:33:14,333 --> 0:33:16,458
In the U.S., it's about half.


624
0:33:16,458 --> 0:33:19,583
And worldwide, burning coal
produces about one quarter


625
0:33:19,583 --> 0:33:22,542
of all greenhouse
gas emissions.


626
0:33:22,542 --> 0:33:24,583
Julio:
If you look in the past coal,


627
0:33:24,583 --> 0:33:27,833
is mighty-- built our country.


628
0:33:27,833 --> 0:33:31,625
It is filthy-- soiled our land
and atmospheres.


629
0:33:31,625 --> 0:33:34,792
In the future I think
coal can be mighty,


630
0:33:34,792 --> 0:33:38,708
and can be clean,
and can be benign.


631
0:33:38,708 --> 0:33:41,542
Narrator: Clean coal
may seem like a contradiction,


632
0:33:41,542 --> 0:33:43,75
but if it's real,
it has implications


633
0:33:43,75 --> 0:33:46,5
not just for China,
but also for the U.S.


634
0:33:46,5 --> 0:33:49,167
and many developing nations.


635
0:33:49,167 --> 0:33:51,5
TPRI is owned
by Huaneng Power,


636
0:33:51,5 --> 0:33:54,792
one of the largest utilities
in the world.


637
0:33:54,792 --> 0:33:56,917
They've renamed this key
national laboratory


638
0:33:56,917 --> 0:34:0,333
the Clean Energy
Research Institute.


639
0:34:0,333 --> 0:34:5,208
Xu Shisen is the Director.


640
0:34:5,208 --> 0:34:6,958
Xu [translator]: Coal-fired
power plants account


641
0:34:6,958 --> 0:34:10,25
for 74% of China's
energy production.


642
0:34:10,25 --> 0:34:13,667
It's the main source
of power generation.


643
0:34:13,667 --> 0:34:15,958
Narrator: Coal is dirty,
but cheap and abundant.


644
0:34:15,958 --> 0:34:18,292
The Institute's new mission
is to develop innovative


645
0:34:18,292 --> 0:34:21,667
technologies and processes
that can burn this hydrocarbon,


646
0:34:21,667 --> 0:34:25,958
in cleaner, safer ways.


647
0:34:25,958 --> 0:34:28,917
Julio: Coal is half
of the world's power today.


648
0:34:28,917 --> 0:34:32,375
It's half of the emissions
that the U.S.


649
0:34:32,375 --> 0:34:33,917
and China put
into the atmosphere.


650
0:34:33,917 --> 0:34:36,875
We just have to tackle
coal directly.


651
0:34:36,875 --> 0:34:39,333
There is no solution
to climate change


652
0:34:39,333 --> 0:34:42,917
that doesn't involve China
reassessing its coal markets,


653
0:34:42,917 --> 0:34:45,0
and its coal conversion
technology.


654
0:34:45,0 --> 0:34:47,75
And they're doing that.


655
0:34:47,75 --> 0:34:49,833
Xu: China started
researching and developing


656
0:34:49,833 --> 0:34:56,208
clean coal technology back
in the early 1990s.


657
0:34:56,208 --> 0:34:57,958
Narrator: Technology
developed at the Institute


658
0:34:57,958 --> 0:35:1,0
is used in this pilot carbon
sequestration facility,


659
0:35:1,0 --> 0:35:3,167
outside Shanghai.


660
0:35:3,167 --> 0:35:5,708
It's attached
to the giant Shidongkou #2


661
0:35:5,708 --> 0:35:11,167
generating station,
also owned by Huaneng Power.


662
0:35:11,167 --> 0:35:14,625
This plant uses a process
called Post Combustion Capture,


663
0:35:14,625 --> 0:35:18,0
P-C-C, where coal is first
burned in a more or less


664
0:35:18,0 --> 0:35:22,917
traditional manner,
and then the CO2 is captured.


665
0:35:22,917 --> 0:35:25,542
Julio: So Shidongkou
is remarkable in every way.


666
0:35:25,542 --> 0:35:28,917
They're capturing 150,000 tons
of carbon dioxide, and they've


667
0:35:28,917 --> 0:35:32,125
been doing that now for about
18 months successfully.


668
0:35:32,125 --> 0:35:34,125
Narrator: Shidongkou
sells the captured CO2


669
0:35:34,125 --> 0:35:36,542
for use in soft drinks
and chemicals,


670
0:35:36,542 --> 0:35:38,75
turning it into a resource.


671
0:35:38,75 --> 0:35:41,25
In the future, they'll scale up
and begin sequestering


672
0:35:41,25 --> 0:35:43,417
the CO2 deep underground.


673
0:35:43,417 --> 0:35:45,583
Julio: Already, that means
that it works and that the cost


674
0:35:45,583 --> 0:35:47,75
and performance
are pretty well understood.


675
0:35:47,75 --> 0:35:50,875
So, if it can be widely applied,
then it creates


676
0:35:50,875 --> 0:35:53,0
the new benchmark
that will define


677
0:35:53,0 --> 0:35:56,83
whether or not this works
anywhere else.


678
0:35:56,83 --> 0:35:58,667
Narrator: If this new
technology works, any existing


679
0:35:58,667 --> 0:36:2,833
coal plant can be retrofitted
and run more cleanly.


680
0:36:2,833 --> 0:36:4,125
Xu:
But it is more about


681
0:36:4,125 --> 0:36:7,708
the economic feasibility because
the cost is very high,


682
0:36:7,708 --> 0:36:12,125
which increases the price
of electricity by about 20%.


683
0:36:12,125 --> 0:36:13,792
Julio: Nobody wants
to pay more for power,


684
0:36:13,792 --> 0:36:17,375
but nobody wants to have
contaminated rivers and skies.


685
0:36:17,375 --> 0:36:20,75
If we can pay 20 percent
more to get Carbon Capture


686
0:36:20,75 --> 0:36:23,375
and Sequestration deployed
at scale in today's fleet,


687
0:36:23,375 --> 0:36:25,917
I would be a very, very,
happy guy


688
0:36:25,917 --> 0:36:27,708
if we could get away for that.


689
0:36:27,708 --> 0:36:29,417
Narrator: Shidongkou Number 2
demonstrates


690
0:36:29,417 --> 0:36:32,875
what can be done
at many older power plants.


691
0:36:32,875 --> 0:36:36,0
But the Greengen construction
site near Tianjin,


692
0:36:36,0 --> 0:36:38,167
about 70 miles south
of Beijing,


693
0:36:38,167 --> 0:36:40,792
represents a completely new
approach to turning coal


694
0:36:40,792 --> 0:36:46,75
into energy with minimal
pollution and emissions.


695
0:36:46,75 --> 0:36:50,167
Albert Lin is an American
venture capitalist.


696
0:36:50,167 --> 0:36:51,875
Together with his colleague,
Bill Douglas,


697
0:36:51,875 --> 0:36:54,708
from Houston, Texas, they've
licensed Huaneng technology


698
0:36:54,708 --> 0:36:56,125
for what they hope will be


699
0:36:56,125 --> 0:36:59,5
a clean coal plant
in Pennsylvania.


700
0:36:59,5 --> 0:37:2,375
They visited Greengen
in July 2010.


701
0:37:2,375 --> 0:37:3,833
Albert Lin:
A year and a half ago


702
0:37:3,833 --> 0:37:6,583
when I was here,
this was just cleared land.


703
0:37:6,583 --> 0:37:8,208
And so this kind of a project,


704
0:37:8,208 --> 0:37:11,708
of this size at this pace,
is unprecedented.


705
0:37:11,708 --> 0:37:14,292
Narrator: By October 2011,
the physical structure


706
0:37:14,292 --> 0:37:19,83
was completed, with
commissioning tests ongoing.


707
0:37:19,83 --> 0:37:23,542
Lin: This is the world's most
advanced coal gasifier.


708
0:37:23,542 --> 0:37:25,583
Narrator: This structure,
at the heart of Greengen,


709
0:37:25,583 --> 0:37:28,75
burns coal converted
into what's called syn-gas,


710
0:37:28,75 --> 0:37:34,375
and emits far fewer pollutants
than a traditional plant.


711
0:37:34,375 --> 0:37:35,792
Xu:
The ultimate goal for GreenGen


712
0:37:35,792 --> 0:37:41,5
is to generate 400MW
of electricity.


713
0:37:41,5 --> 0:37:48,792
At the same time, we want
to capture 90% of the CO2.


714
0:37:48,792 --> 0:37:50,792
Narrator: Once Greengen
is fully operational,


715
0:37:50,792 --> 0:37:53,75
the CO2 will be pumped
offshore to be used


716
0:37:53,75 --> 0:37:55,792
in enhanced oil recovery.


717
0:37:55,792 --> 0:37:57,83
Julio:
If it works as advertised


718
0:37:57,83 --> 0:38:0,42
and if the costs are competitive
with other clean energy,


719
0:38:0,42 --> 0:38:3,625
it creates a technology option
that's new for the world.


720
0:38:3,625 --> 0:38:5,708
Narrator: And Greengen
should cost about one half


721
0:38:5,708 --> 0:38:8,542
of the similar project planned
for Pennsylvania.


722
0:38:8,542 --> 0:38:10,125
Julio:
It's not just green washing.


723
0:38:10,125 --> 0:38:12,375
They expect these things
to operate for thirty years,


724
0:38:12,375 --> 0:38:15,208
they expect them
to perform as advertised,


725
0:38:15,208 --> 0:38:16,667
they expect them to be clean.


726
0:38:16,667 --> 0:38:21,167
And they expect them to be
a solution to the country.


727
0:38:21,167 --> 0:38:23,458
Narrator: It's no secret,
especially to anyone living


728
0:38:23,458 --> 0:38:28,292
in a big Chinese city, that air
quality is often dangerous.


729
0:38:28,292 --> 0:38:31,167
And clean coal proponents
like Lin and Friedman


730
0:38:31,167 --> 0:38:33,167
recognize the harm
that increasing levels


731
0:38:33,167 --> 0:38:36,25
of carbon dioxide
do to climate.


732
0:38:36,25 --> 0:38:40,208
They think that paying now
is better than paying later.


733
0:38:40,208 --> 0:38:42,458
Lin: The reality is that
if climate were not important


734
0:38:42,458 --> 0:38:45,25
or were not a factor, we would
not be doing any of this.


735
0:38:45,25 --> 0:38:49,83
Because it is cheaper to pollute
and do it the old-fashioned way.


736
0:38:49,83 --> 0:38:50,583
But what we're saying is


737
0:38:50,583 --> 0:38:52,25
there's a better way out
for every one


738
0:38:52,25 --> 0:38:54,458
because sooner or later
we are going to have to address


739
0:38:54,458 --> 0:38:56,625
the climate issues,
and the pollution issues,


740
0:38:56,625 --> 0:38:58,292
and the things
that have been associated


741
0:38:58,292 --> 0:39:1,25
with a growing population.


742
0:39:1,25 --> 0:39:2,458
Friedman:
I think it's pretty clear


743
0:39:2,458 --> 0:39:4,792
to everybody that China
is going for the gold.


744
0:39:4,792 --> 0:39:8,25
They want to be number one
in all these areas.


745
0:39:8,25 --> 0:39:10,333
And they're committing to it
in the same way


746
0:39:10,333 --> 0:39:13,292
that an Olympic athlete
commits to that goal.


747
0:39:13,292 --> 0:39:18,83
They're using every resource
they have to move ahead


748
0:39:18,83 --> 0:39:22,958
for their population's needs,
and for their economy's needs.


749
0:39:22,958 --> 0:39:26,333
Narrator: China's breakneck
development may seem chaotic.


750
0:39:26,333 --> 0:39:28,667
But behind the seeming chaos
there's literally


751
0:39:28,667 --> 0:39:31,667
a plan in their energy
policies.


752
0:39:31,667 --> 0:39:35,167
China's 12th 5-year Plan,
announced in 2011,


753
0:39:35,167 --> 0:39:37,458
set ambitious goals
for how much power


754
0:39:37,458 --> 0:39:40,417
must be generated
by renewable energy.


755
0:39:40,417 --> 0:39:42,917
Of course, top down direction
is easier


756
0:39:42,917 --> 0:39:47,583
in an authoritarian state,
but CO2 emissions per unit


757
0:39:47,583 --> 0:39:53,75
of economic output are targeted
for a 17% reduction by 2015.


758
0:39:53,75 --> 0:39:56,5
Friedman: I think the most
important thing to learn


759
0:39:56,5 --> 0:39:59,0
from what China
is doing these days


760
0:39:59,0 --> 0:40:1,583
is that it's good
to have a plan.


761
0:40:1,583 --> 0:40:4,833
You can quibble with their
plan, but they have one.


762
0:40:4,833 --> 0:40:9,25
Having that plan, having that
long arc of commitment,


763
0:40:9,25 --> 0:40:15,75
is what's really going
to deliver the goods.


764
0:40:15,75 --> 0:40:17,917
Narrator: Will the result
of all China's plans,


765
0:40:17,917 --> 0:40:21,917
and incentives, and subsidies,
be more blue sky days--


766
0:40:21,917 --> 0:40:23,458
where traditions endure,
and people


767
0:40:23,458 --> 0:40:29,83
eventually enjoy cleaner air?


768
0:40:29,83 --> 0:40:31,42
Will sustained policy
and state planning


769
0:40:31,42 --> 0:40:34,83
result in abundant energy
and technological achievements


770
0:40:34,83 --> 0:40:39,0
to rival those
of the first Chinese Emperor?


771
0:40:39,0 --> 0:40:41,625
But all that won't matter much
to the planet's climate


772
0:40:41,625 --> 0:40:44,5
if China, the United States,
India, and others


773
0:40:44,5 --> 0:40:47,42
decide to keep coal
and other fossil fuels


774
0:40:47,42 --> 0:40:50,125
a major portion
of their energy mix--


775
0:40:50,125 --> 0:40:55,292
without paying the price
to burn them cleanly.


776
0:40:55,292 --> 0:40:56,5
Richard Alley:
So, the Earth provides


777
0:40:56,5 --> 0:41:0,208
lots of choices for clean,
low carbon energy.


778
0:41:0,208 --> 0:41:4,292
And Brazil, China and Texas show
there are ways forward.


779
0:41:4,292 --> 0:41:5,5
But can we afford it?


780
0:41:5,5 --> 0:41:8,917
Can society make the kinds
of changes needed?


781
0:41:8,917 --> 0:41:11,167
Well, we've done it before.


782
0:41:11,167 --> 0:41:15,458
(Bagpipes play)


783
0:41:15,458 --> 0:41:18,625
Let's take a walk through
history in Edinburgh, Scotland,


784
0:41:18,625 --> 0:41:20,458
but it could be
many other big cities


785
0:41:20,458 --> 0:41:24,25
a couple of centuries ago.


786
0:41:24,25 --> 0:41:28,833
Here's what a visitor
from London wrote in 1754--


787
0:41:28,833 --> 0:41:30,0
[Man with English accent]
"When I first came


788
0:41:30,0 --> 0:41:31,792
into the High Street
of that city,


789
0:41:31,792 --> 0:41:34,292
I thought I had not seen
anything of the kind


790
0:41:34,292 --> 0:41:37,875
more magnificent-- the extreme
height of the houses,


791
0:41:37,875 --> 0:41:40,917
which are, for the most part,
built with stone,


792
0:41:40,917 --> 0:41:43,917
and well sashed..."


793
0:41:43,917 --> 0:41:48,583
Alley: It's evening,
time for a wee bite!


794
0:41:48,583 --> 0:41:51,375
Scottish taverns, then as now,
were noisy places,


795
0:41:51,375 --> 0:41:56,0
buzzing with good conversation
and high spirits.


796
0:41:56,0 --> 0:41:59,417
The visitor from London dined
well and drank a few glasses


797
0:41:59,417 --> 0:42:2,583
of fine French claret,
but then his new friends


798
0:42:2,583 --> 0:42:5,125
did something that was
second nature to them


799
0:42:5,125 --> 0:42:11,208
in the 18th Century, but seems
very strange to us today.


800
0:42:11,208 --> 0:42:12,75
[English accent]
"The clock struck ten,


801
0:42:12,75 --> 0:42:15,75
then the company began to light
pieces of paper,


802
0:42:15,75 --> 0:42:19,792
and throw them upon the table
to smoke the room..."


803
0:42:19,792 --> 0:42:21,125
Alley:
Lighting those pieces of paper


804
0:42:21,125 --> 0:42:24,625
was meant to mix
one bad smell with another.


805
0:42:24,625 --> 0:42:27,958
Chambermaid:
"Gardyloo!"


806
0:42:27,958 --> 0:42:29,958
Alley: You see,
ten o'clock was when you could


807
0:42:29,958 --> 0:42:34,833
empty brimming chamber pots
down into the streets.


808
0:42:34,833 --> 0:42:35,958
Chambermaid:
"Gardyloo!"


809
0:42:35,958 --> 0:42:39,83
Man: "Hud your haunde"/
Hold your hand!


810
0:42:39,83 --> 0:42:40,708
Alley: The London
visitor safely dodged


811
0:42:40,708 --> 0:42:44,208
the terrible shower,
but then he was forced to hide


812
0:42:44,208 --> 0:42:46,625
between his bed sheets
to avoid the smell


813
0:42:46,625 --> 0:42:49,375
pouring into his room
from the filth.


814
0:42:49,375 --> 0:42:51,958
And yet the people
had gotten used to this,


815
0:42:51,958 --> 0:42:54,625
to the inconvenience
and disease, and some people


816
0:42:54,625 --> 0:42:57,958
made a living hauling away
the human waste.


817
0:42:57,958 --> 0:43:1,667
The English visitor thought
all this simply had no remedy.


818
0:43:1,667 --> 0:43:4,125
[English accent] "Anything
so expensive as a conveyance


819
0:43:4,125 --> 0:43:6,75
for the waste down
from the uppermost floor


820
0:43:6,75 --> 0:43:8,625
could never be agreed on.


821
0:43:8,625 --> 0:43:11,83
Nor could there be made,
within the building,


822
0:43:11,83 --> 0:43:15,667
any receiver suitable to such
numbers of people."


823
0:43:15,667 --> 0:43:17,167
Alley:
So, what do chamber pots


824
0:43:17,167 --> 0:43:21,167
have to do with carbon dioxide
and sustainable energy?


825
0:43:21,167 --> 0:43:24,708
Not to mince words, we're
pouring CO2, another form


826
0:43:24,708 --> 0:43:27,833
of human waste, into the public
space, and we'll have


827
0:43:27,833 --> 0:43:32,667
to deal with the consequences
if we don't clean it up.


828
0:43:32,667 --> 0:43:35,292
Today, of course, most of us
have conveyances


829
0:43:35,292 --> 0:43:37,875
down from bathrooms,
and sinks to wash in,


830
0:43:37,875 --> 0:43:40,917
and receivers for our waste.


831
0:43:40,917 --> 0:43:42,42
What happened?


832
0:43:42,42 --> 0:43:43,458
Look around your house.


833
0:43:43,458 --> 0:43:44,917
How much did
the porcelain throne


834
0:43:44,917 --> 0:43:48,417
in your bathroom really cost?


835
0:43:48,417 --> 0:43:50,958
It took a considerable
investment for all those pipes


836
0:43:50,958 --> 0:43:55,375
bringing water to wash with,
and to take the waste away.


837
0:43:55,375 --> 0:43:57,875
The revolution in hygiene
involved an extensive


838
0:43:57,875 --> 0:44:0,5
infrastructure
of toilets in homes,


839
0:44:0,5 --> 0:44:3,875
sewers underneath our cities,
water treatment plants.


840
0:44:3,875 --> 0:44:8,375
Today we might call it
the Sanitation Smart Grid.


841
0:44:8,375 --> 0:44:11,125
So, how much did all this cost?


842
0:44:11,125 --> 0:44:13,833
Not that much, if you consider
the millions of lives saved


843
0:44:13,833 --> 0:44:17,208
with clean water, prevention
of diseases like cholera


844
0:44:17,208 --> 0:44:20,917
and typhoid-- something like
1% of the economy,


845
0:44:20,917 --> 0:44:22,75
in very round numbers.


846
0:44:22,75 --> 0:44:25,25
And that's more or less
the estimated cost


847
0:44:25,25 --> 0:44:28,542
of switching the world
to a sustainable energy system


848
0:44:28,542 --> 0:44:33,0
that doesn't dump fossil fuel
CO2 into the public space.


849
0:44:33,0 --> 0:44:35,875
Cleaning up the cities took
decades and even centuries,


850
0:44:35,875 --> 0:44:37,917
and we're trying to do things
a little faster,


851
0:44:37,917 --> 0:44:40,417
but the revolution
in waste management shows


852
0:44:40,417 --> 0:44:43,292
that we can do big things
to get benefits


853
0:44:43,292 --> 0:44:47,458
that none of us would ever
walk away from.


854
0:44:47,458 --> 0:44:50,708
Narrator: Old energy
technologies can be cleaned up.


855
0:44:50,708 --> 0:44:53,0
New ones can come online.


856
0:44:53,0 --> 0:44:55,125
Other nations
are moving ahead.


857
0:44:55,125 --> 0:44:58,667
What will it take to keep the
lights on in the United States,


858
0:44:58,667 --> 0:45:3,42
and Avoid The Energy Abyss.


859
0:45:3,42 --> 0:45:4,958
There's no question
that transitioning to clean


860
0:45:4,958 --> 0:45:9,667
and renewable energy
is going to be a huge task.


861
0:45:9,667 --> 0:45:13,625
But America has done
similar things before.


862
0:45:13,625 --> 0:45:16,458
Take the Hoover Dam,
and the electrification program


863
0:45:16,458 --> 0:45:18,833
of the 1930s.


864
0:45:18,833 --> 0:45:21,667
Or the building of
the Interstate highway system.


865
0:45:21,667 --> 0:45:23,125
Hofmeister:
Well, I am optimistic.


866
0:45:23,125 --> 0:45:26,5
John Hofmeister is a former
oil man, based in Texas.


867
0:45:26,5 --> 0:45:29,917
He headed up Shell
in the United States.


868
0:45:29,917 --> 0:45:33,625
He also wrote a book entitled
Why We Hate The Oil Companies,


869
0:45:33,625 --> 0:45:36,0
and he's worried that today
America isn't making


870
0:45:36,0 --> 0:45:38,208
the right decisions
about energy.


871
0:45:38,208 --> 0:45:39,208
Hofmeister:
You need to think of energy


872
0:45:39,208 --> 0:45:41,208
in a 50-year time frame.


873
0:45:41,208 --> 0:45:44,208
And our elected officials
are thinking of energy


874
0:45:44,208 --> 0:45:46,583
in two-year election cycles.


875
0:45:46,583 --> 0:45:48,167
That's ridiculous!


876
0:45:48,167 --> 0:45:51,917
And it is going to take us, as a
nation, to an energy abyss,


877
0:45:51,917 --> 0:45:54,875
because you can't design
an energy system


878
0:45:54,875 --> 0:45:58,375
to replace the 20th century,
which is growing old,


879
0:45:58,375 --> 0:46:1,583
and running out in some cases,
you can't replace that


880
0:46:1,583 --> 0:46:4,625
with two year cycles
of decision making.


881
0:46:4,625 --> 0:46:7,5
Narrator:
Other nations have changed.


882
0:46:7,5 --> 0:46:10,417
Look around Copenhagen
and you see pedestrian walkways


883
0:46:10,417 --> 0:46:13,917
and bikes as a major form
of transportation.


884
0:46:13,917 --> 0:46:17,542
In response to the Oil Shocks
of the 1970s, Denmark


885
0:46:17,542 --> 0:46:22,25
turned away from fossil fuel
and toward sustainable energy.


886
0:46:22,25 --> 0:46:24,333
Soren: In Denmark
we had car-free Sundays


887
0:46:24,333 --> 0:46:26,917
where nobody was allowed
to drive their cars on Sundays.


888
0:46:26,917 --> 0:46:29,75
And there was a rationing
of fuel and gas.


889
0:46:29,75 --> 0:46:33,542
Lykke: These are sort of things
that people remember,


890
0:46:33,542 --> 0:46:36,542
"Well, we need to change."


891
0:46:36,542 --> 0:46:39,625
Narrator: The U.S. also
experienced the Oil Shocks,


892
0:46:39,625 --> 0:46:42,5
with gas lines
and angry citizens.


893
0:46:42,5 --> 0:46:45,625
And for a while, America got
serious about exploring


894
0:46:45,625 --> 0:46:48,917
alternatives to imported
gasoline and fossil fuel.


895
0:46:48,917 --> 0:46:51,5
Here's the energy share of all
Federal, non-defense


896
0:46:51,5 --> 0:46:56,708
R&D investment
from 1957 through 2011.


897
0:46:56,708 --> 0:46:59,42
Investment ramped up
in the Oil Shock,


898
0:46:59,42 --> 0:47:3,208
but then went down,
down, down.


899
0:47:3,208 --> 0:47:5,125
And without serious new
commitments,


900
0:47:5,125 --> 0:47:7,875
the 2009 stimulus funds
for energy,


901
0:47:7,875 --> 0:47:11,125
will just have been
a temporary upward blip.


902
0:47:11,125 --> 0:47:12,625
Hofmeister:
We're not making the decisions


903
0:47:12,625 --> 0:47:15,542
at the national level
that need to be made,


904
0:47:15,542 --> 0:47:17,542
in terms of the next decade,


905
0:47:17,542 --> 0:47:20,167
and the next several decades
after that.


906
0:47:20,167 --> 0:47:21,708
Narrator:
Hofmeister and other experts


907
0:47:21,708 --> 0:47:24,83
look around the world
and see other countries


908
0:47:24,83 --> 0:47:27,458
moving ahead to defend their
nation's energy security.


909
0:47:27,458 --> 0:47:30,125
Hofmeister: Places
like China have a clear plan,


910
0:47:30,125 --> 0:47:32,292
and they are driving forward.


911
0:47:32,292 --> 0:47:34,708
And they are building
an energy infrastructure


912
0:47:34,708 --> 0:47:37,458
for the 21st century,
which will perhaps


913
0:47:37,458 --> 0:47:40,42
one day supply energy
to the world's


914
0:47:40,42 --> 0:47:43,917
largest economy--
China, not the U.S.


915
0:47:43,917 --> 0:47:45,875
Narrator:
In America, energy policies


916
0:47:45,875 --> 0:47:50,375
change with each new
Administration, if not sooner.


917
0:47:50,375 --> 0:47:53,667
Since our interview, Denmark's
government has changed parties,


918
0:47:53,667 --> 0:47:56,708
but now former Minister
of Climate and Energy,


919
0:47:56,708 --> 0:47:59,375
Lykke Friis, doesn't expect
energy policy


920
0:47:59,375 --> 0:48:1,5
to change that much.


921
0:48:1,5 --> 0:48:3,833
Lykke: Even if we
are kicked out of office,


922
0:48:3,833 --> 0:48:7,708
this will not lead to a huge
change in our energy policy.


923
0:48:7,708 --> 0:48:11,125
Hofmeister: We need decisions
that go beyond a single term


924
0:48:11,125 --> 0:48:14,125
of a President, that go beyond
a single Congress,


925
0:48:14,125 --> 0:48:16,458
with a Republican
or a Democratic majority.


926
0:48:16,458 --> 0:48:18,583
And we're not doing it.


927
0:48:18,583 --> 0:48:20,583
Other parts of the world are.


928
0:48:20,583 --> 0:48:21,917
Lykke:
All countries have to embark


929
0:48:21,917 --> 0:48:23,792
upon this transformation.


930
0:48:23,792 --> 0:48:26,333
And the lesson is, it can
be done, because Denmark,


931
0:48:26,333 --> 0:48:29,958
we've had also growth rate
by 80% since the 80s.


932
0:48:29,958 --> 0:48:32,167
But our energy consumption
and CO2 emissions


933
0:48:32,167 --> 0:48:33,667
have been more or less stable.


934
0:48:33,667 --> 0:48:36,0
Hofmeister: We're going
to find ourselves as a nation,


935
0:48:36,0 --> 0:48:39,792
entering third world status
when it comes


936
0:48:39,792 --> 0:48:44,208
to the reliability of our
energy system, within a decade,


937
0:48:44,208 --> 0:48:47,792
if we don't get
with a different program.


938
0:48:47,792 --> 0:48:50,625
And I don't see any inclination
now to make hard decisions.


939
0:48:50,625 --> 0:48:53,708
I see divisiveness,
I see partisan paralysis,


940
0:48:53,708 --> 0:48:56,208
I see short-term political
time thinking,


941
0:48:56,208 --> 0:48:59,167
and I see dysfunctional
government.


942
0:48:59,167 --> 0:49:0,75
Narrator:
America may lack consensus


943
0:49:0,75 --> 0:49:3,875
on a national climate policy,
and about building


944
0:49:3,875 --> 0:49:7,42
a new energy system,
but some states and cities


945
0:49:7,42 --> 0:49:12,333
are moving ahead, with new
ideas and new technologies.


946
0:49:12,333 --> 0:49:16,25
Call them, Laboratories
Of Low-Carbon Living.


947
0:49:16,25 --> 0:49:19,625
Here are three examples
of communities actively engaged


948
0:49:19,625 --> 0:49:22,917
in reducing
their carbon footprint.


949
0:49:22,917 --> 0:49:26,125
In rural Alaska, trees are
harvested from rivers


950
0:49:26,125 --> 0:49:28,917
to power biomass boilers,
cutting the cost


951
0:49:28,917 --> 0:49:31,375
of shipping in diesel,
generating local jobs,


952
0:49:31,375 --> 0:49:34,875
and keeping dollars
in the community.


953
0:49:34,875 --> 0:49:36,83
Dennis Charley:
The community cuts wood


954
0:49:36,83 --> 0:49:37,583
and brings it in
and everything.


955
0:49:37,583 --> 0:49:41,167
So instead of all the money
going to the oil companies,


956
0:49:41,167 --> 0:49:43,958
it's a community thing now.


957
0:49:43,958 --> 0:49:46,167
Narrator: Baltimore, Maryland,
is tapping what some call


958
0:49:46,167 --> 0:49:51,167
the fifth fuel-- conservation
and energy efficiency.


959
0:49:51,167 --> 0:49:54,42
Experts think saving energy can
cover almost one quarter


960
0:49:54,42 --> 0:49:57,42
of U.S. needs by 2030.


961
0:49:57,42 --> 0:49:58,625
Robbyn Lewis: We want
Patterson Park neighborhood


962
0:49:58,625 --> 0:50:3,625
to be the most energy efficient,
greenest, most sustainable


963
0:50:3,625 --> 0:50:6,667
neighborhood in the City,
and by signing this pledge


964
0:50:6,667 --> 0:50:11,875
you join like 120, 130
other people who already signed.


965
0:50:11,875 --> 0:50:14,25
Narrator: In their second year,
the Baltimore Neighborhood


966
0:50:14,25 --> 0:50:17,375
Energy Challenge saved more
than 2 million kilowatt hours


967
0:50:17,375 --> 0:50:21,542
and nearly 7% on gas
and electric bills.


968
0:50:21,542 --> 0:50:25,583
In Kansas, America's heartland,
the Climate and Energy Project


969
0:50:25,583 --> 0:50:28,5
used federal stimulus dollars
to fund four prizes


970
0:50:28,5 --> 0:50:32,125
of $100,000, to be awarded
to the communities


971
0:50:32,125 --> 0:50:35,25
that conserved
the most energy.


972
0:50:35,25 --> 0:50:37,917
That resulted in savings of
more than two million dollars


973
0:50:37,917 --> 0:50:41,42
in 2011,
savings that are expected


974
0:50:41,42 --> 0:50:45,125
to continue each year
for the next decade.


975
0:50:45,125 --> 0:50:47,0
Nancy Jackson: We're looking
at energy efficiency


976
0:50:47,0 --> 0:50:49,875
and presenting it
as a win-win-win,


977
0:50:49,875 --> 0:50:52,875
because it allows people
to save money in their homes


978
0:50:52,875 --> 0:50:54,5
and their churches
and their businesses


979
0:50:54,5 --> 0:50:55,833
and their communities.


980
0:50:55,833 --> 0:50:59,0
It allows them to build
their local economies because


981
0:50:59,0 --> 0:51:1,667
it employs lots of people,
installing insulation


982
0:51:1,667 --> 0:51:3,458
and windows and appliances.


983
0:51:3,458 --> 0:51:7,25
And at the same time,
it insures a much more robust


984
0:51:7,25 --> 0:51:9,375
and healthy energy future.


985
0:51:9,375 --> 0:51:10,833
Narrator:
But Richard Alley believes


986
0:51:10,833 --> 0:51:12,292
building a clean and
sustainable future


987
0:51:12,292 --> 0:51:15,375
takes a sustained
and national effort.


988
0:51:15,375 --> 0:51:18,25
Alley: It took more than
one hundred years for Shuman's


989
0:51:18,25 --> 0:51:22,0
ideas of concentrated
solar power to come to scale.


990
0:51:22,0 --> 0:51:24,375
It took thirty years
for Brazil to develop


991
0:51:24,375 --> 0:51:28,42
a national infrastructure
for sugar cane ethanol.


992
0:51:28,42 --> 0:51:31,667
China needed six five-year
plans to go from a poor,


993
0:51:31,667 --> 0:51:37,542
agrarian society to a world
leader in clean technology.


994
0:51:37,542 --> 0:51:38,958
And the choices we make today


995
0:51:38,958 --> 0:51:41,583
will shape
America's energy future.


996
0:51:41,583 --> 0:51:45,792
And what happens in China
and Chicago, India, and Indiana,


997
0:51:45,792 --> 0:51:47,917
will shape the planet.


998
0:51:47,917 --> 0:51:49,583
The clock is ticking.


999
0:51:49,583 --> 0:51:52,292
The longer we ignore what's
needed to move forward


1000
0:51:52,292 --> 0:51:56,542
with non-polluting energy
sources, the more it'll cost,


1001
0:51:56,542 --> 0:52:0,375
in cold cash,
and a warmer planet.


1002
0:52:0,375 --> 0:52:3,333
Earth's history and solid
physics tell us


1003
0:52:3,333 --> 0:52:5,708
the climate our kids
and grandkids could see


1004
0:52:5,708 --> 0:52:9,625
if we keep burning fossil fuels
and releasing the CO2.


1005
0:52:9,625 --> 0:52:12,625
But all of us are able to make
the plans and choices


1006
0:52:12,625 --> 0:52:16,25
we know will work to discover
and develop new ways


1007
0:52:16,25 --> 0:52:18,292
of Powering The Planet.


1008
0:52:18,292 --> 0:52:22,75
For "Earth: The Operators'
Manual", I'm Richard Alley.


1009
0:52:22,75 --> 0:52:27,83
Announcer: Powering the Planet -
Earth: The Operators' Manual


1010
0:52:27,83 --> 0:52:31,917
is made possible by NSF, the
National Science Foundation,


1011
0:52:31,917 --> 0:52:53,625
where discoveries begin.


1012
0:52:53,625 --> 0:52:55,25
Female narrator: 
For the annotated script,


1013
0:52:55,25 --> 0:52:57,25
with links to information
on climate change


1014
0:52:57,25 --> 0:52:58,625
and sustainability,

1022
0:53:36,708 --> 0:53:38,875
Richard Alley: To feed
Earth's growing population


1023
0:53:38,875 --> 0:53:41,667
we may need to double
our food supply.


1024
0:53:41,667 --> 0:53:43,875
And that may not be easy
if we're burning


1025
0:53:43,875 --> 0:53:45,75
a lot of our food for fuel.


1026
0:53:45,75 --> 0:53:49,75
At NREL, D.O.E.'s National
Renewable Energy Lab,


1027
0:53:49,75 --> 0:53:52,833
they're engaged in aggressive
research and development


1028
0:53:52,833 --> 0:53:55,0
to try to extract sugars
to make ethanol


1029
0:53:55,0 --> 0:53:57,5
from non-food sources.


1030
0:53:57,5 --> 0:53:59,333
So what are the big issues?


1031
0:53:59,333 --> 0:54:0,792
How much is available?


1032
0:54:0,792 --> 0:54:2,208
Jim McMillan:
The challenge is economics,


1033
0:54:2,208 --> 0:54:4,417
and it's projected
that in the United States,


1034
0:54:4,417 --> 0:54:9,83
we could be producing over
a billion tons of this material,


1035
0:54:9,83 --> 0:54:12,25
dry matter, on an annual basis.


1036
0:54:12,25 --> 0:54:14,167
Richard Alley: NREL calculates
that would convert


1037
0:54:14,167 --> 0:54:17,167
into 80 billion gallons
of ethanol,


1038
0:54:17,167 --> 0:54:20,292
potentially replacing one third
of all gasoline


1039
0:54:20,292 --> 0:54:22,375
used in U.S. transportation.


1040
0:54:22,375 --> 0:54:25,417
And that would cancel out
all America's oil imports


1041
0:54:25,417 --> 0:54:28,5
from the Middle East,
Nigeria and Russia.


1042
0:54:28,5 --> 0:54:30,417
Jim: We've heard a lot
of articles about biofuels


1043
0:54:30,417 --> 0:54:33,375
being done wrong,
but if we do it right, biofuels


1044
0:54:33,375 --> 0:54:37,583
can be a very significant
part of the solution.


1045
0:54:37,583 --> 0:54:39,667
Narrator: Modern sugar cane
plantations like this one


1046
0:54:39,667 --> 0:54:44,42
use machines for as much
as 75% of the harvesting.


1047
0:54:44,42 --> 0:54:46,875
Unlike the old days, planting
is the only activity


1048
0:54:46,875 --> 0:54:49,792
relying on manual labor.


1049
0:54:49,792 --> 0:54:51,583
Jose Goldemberg:
You know, the system became


1050
0:54:51,583 --> 0:54:54,708
very efficient and used a lot
of mechanization.


1051
0:54:54,708 --> 0:54:57,708
Therefore, to use
mechanization, you need


1052
0:54:57,708 --> 0:55:1,542
a trained labor force
and good machines.


1053
0:55:1,542 --> 0:55:4,583
And sugar cane generates jobs.


1054
0:55:4,583 --> 0:55:7,292
In Brazil, the sugar cane
industry generates


1055
0:55:7,292 --> 0:55:10,5
one million jobs
of good quality,


1056
0:55:10,5 --> 0:55:14,542
better than in other areas
of agriculture.


1057
0:55:14,542 --> 0:55:16,25
Narrator: Worldwide,
there are legitimate concerns


1058
0:55:16,25 --> 0:55:18,958
about diverting food
and water into biofuels,


1059
0:55:18,958 --> 0:55:23,125
and cutting down
CO2-absorbing trees.


1060
0:55:23,125 --> 0:55:25,875
But in recent years,
rates of rainforest loss


1061
0:55:25,875 --> 0:55:30,208
to agriculture in Brazil
have fallen by close to 50%--


1062
0:55:30,208 --> 0:55:32,333
and 90% of water used
to fertilize


1063
0:55:32,333 --> 0:55:37,375
and irrigate modern sugar cane
plantations is recycled.


1064
0:55:37,375 --> 0:55:40,625
Uncle Sam began building
the Hoover Dam in 1931,


1065
0:55:40,625 --> 0:55:44,125
and it was completed in 1936,
under budget,


1066
0:55:44,125 --> 0:55:45,833
and two years ahead
of schedule.


1067
0:55:45,833 --> 0:55:48,167
While the dam impacted
the river ecosystem,


1068
0:55:48,167 --> 0:55:51,625
it created jobs, provided water
and power to millions,


1069
0:55:51,625 --> 0:55:54,625
and has more than paid
for itself.


1070
0:55:54,625 --> 0:55:56,542
The Interstate Highway System
was championed


1071
0:55:56,542 --> 0:56:0,792
by President Eisenhower
to support national defense.


1072
0:56:0,792 --> 0:56:2,583
At more than
400 billion dollars,


1073
0:56:2,583 --> 0:56:7,42
it's one of the largest public
works projects in history.


1074
0:56:7,42 --> 0:56:10,83
Some say it led to America's
over-reliance on cars


1075
0:56:10,83 --> 0:56:12,458
and under-funding
of mass transit,


1076
0:56:12,458 --> 0:56:16,5
but it helped power decades
of economic growth.


1077
0:56:16,5 --> 0:56:19,292
And when the Defense
Department, and later NSF,


1078
0:56:19,292 --> 0:56:22,83
funded the development of what
became today's Internet,


1079
0:56:22,83 --> 0:56:25,208
some called it
the Information Super-Highway.


1080
0:56:25,208 --> 0:56:28,125
It's hard to think of America
without rural electrification,


1081
0:56:28,125 --> 0:56:31,708
Interstates and the Internet,
and it's impossible to deny


1082
0:56:31,708 --> 0:56:34,125
the critical role
of the Federal government


1083
0:56:34,125 --> 0:58:34,125
in building them.
