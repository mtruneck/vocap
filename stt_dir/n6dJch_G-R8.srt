It's been fun riding.


5
0:0:28,61 --> 0:0:33,25
I mean, that's been one of the
most enjoyable parts of the


6
0:0:33,25 --> 0:0:37,17
trip is just fucking hauling
ass and just going.


7
0:0:37,17 --> 0:0:42,38
And you definitely feel like
a free motorcycle renegade


8
0:0:42,38 --> 0:0:45,95

highway, going however fast


9

I kind of think Victoria and
Mexico are kind of alike.


14

there's always characters

everywhere.

That one place we stopped at and
the Sporsters ran out of


19
0:1:14,465 --> 0:1:16,65
gas, and there was this
lady living in


20
0:1:16,65 --> 0:1:19,38
the middle of nowhere.


21
0:1:19,38 --> 0:1:21,64
And she's got a cell phone.


22
0:1:21,64 --> 0:1:24,69
And she's standing on the
highway waiting for a ride.


23
0:1:24,69 --> 0:1:29,675
And then probably fucking seven
miles down the road,


24
0:1:29,675 --> 0:1:34,288
it's the biggest city for
smaller cities in Mexico.

27

28
0:2:11,98 --> 0:2:15,12
usually I'd go on trips in the
summer and it's really hot.


29
0:2:15,12 --> 0:2:16,99
And we're probably
not showering.


30
0:2:16,99 --> 0:2:20,44
And even if I'll go on a trip
and it's freezing, it just


31
0:2:20,44 --> 0:2:22,87
became a thing with
me and my friends.


32
0:2:22,87 --> 0:2:26,3

no matter what.
