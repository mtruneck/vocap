###7 Hey, I'm Hanson O'Haver.
###8 Welcome to this week on Drake, Vice's look at what Drake's
###10 been up to lately.
###12 So there are really two big pieces of
###13 Drake news this week.
###14 The first is that he announced a tour that's sort of like
###18 monsters of blog rap tour.
###20 It's with 2 Chainz, formerly Tity Boi, J Cole, Waka Flocka,
###26 and the geographically confoundingly
###28 named French Montana.
###32 Personally, I'm not really a big fan of concerts, because I
###34 think all the best Drake songs are kind of sad, like about
###38 being lonely.
###39 I think it's sort of weird to be with 2,000 people in a room
###43 feeling alienated.
###45 The other piece of news, he was in Miami alongside of
###48 Birdman, Lil' Wayne, and DJ Khaled filming a video for
###52 "HYFR." Personally, I think that "HYFR" is probably one of
###57 the worst songs on Take Care, just because the chorus of
###60 "Hell yeah, fucking right" is really dumb.
###62 Like, to just repeat that over and over doesn't really do
###65 much for me.
###66 And also because in the song, Drake and Lil' Wayne talk
###69 about fucking the same girls, and it's kind of weird.
###72 Like, I just think Lil' Wayne's sort of gross.
###75 But to be fair to Wayne, I knew this girl in high school
###79 that moved to LA, and I heard that she sucked his dick, and
###83 nothing bad happened to her.
###84 Like, she's fine and everything.
###85 So if Drake's cool with that, more power to Drake.
###90 But anyways, the video's supposed to
###92 be Bar Mitzvah themed.
###93 I never got a chance to go to a Bar Mitzvah, so I hope that
###97 the video will kind of show me what that's all about.
###99 Take care.
