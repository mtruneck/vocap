###22 MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: The Orange Lodge in Belfast, the oldest
###24 Protestant fraternal organization in the country,
###26 organizes the July 12 parade.
###28 Before the start of the march, we stopped by their
###30 headquarters.
###30 It was teeming with people from all around the
###33 Anglosphere.
###34 TOM HAIRE: The 12th of July is the commemorating of the 121st
###37 anniversary of the Battle of the Boyne.
###41 It is important to do because at the end of the day, the
###44 Battle of the Boyne gave everyone through the world,
###47 shall we say, civil and religious liberty.
###50 And sometimes that liberty, at the moment, is being eroded by
###54 different legislation, which affects some of our parade.
###58 MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: Explain to those who would be completely
###61 baffled by this how a bunch of Canadians come to march in an
###64 Orange parade in Belfast.
###66 MALE SPEAKER: My family roots here are
###67 five generations gone.
###68 Like, I'm a five-generation Canadian, but
###70 all Orange, in Canada.
###71 Canada was a big place for the Orange Order as well.
###74 We don't say a whole lot when we come here, because
###76 unfortunately, it's not our fight.
###78 MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: You're not throwing paving stones at
###80 people
###80 MALE SPEAKER: No, no.
###80 MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: Molotov cocktails.
###82 MALE SPEAKER: As you know, Canadians, we're probably the
###83 most easygoing people around.
###85 [MARCHING BAND PLAYING]
###93 MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: The parades have just begun.
###94 We're walking down Crumlin Road.
###96 As you can see, I am leading the parade.
###98 I am leaving the Prods down Crumlin road to a flash point
###102 very close to here.
###104 So far, there hasn't been a hitch.
###106 There's police presence, very, very, very heavy.
###109 And we'll see what happens.
###112 [MARCHING BAND PLAYING]
###138 MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: To everyone willing to talk to us, the
###139 parade was a celebration of Protestant culture.
###142 But increasingly, it became apparent that it was also a
###144 celebration of that particular Ulster talent for massive
###147 alcohol consumption.
###148 We're about an hour into this march in Ulster, in the city
###152 center of Belfast.
###154 Things, according to Twitter, that we're following this on,
###157 have passed off fairly peacefully in
###158 all the flash points.
###160 But the atmosphere's a bit strange.
###161 It's a bit somber.
###162 It's a bit grey.
###163 It's a bit dim.
###164 We were told last night that Protestants don't like to talk
###167 people from the media.
###168 So we've asked a few people to talk to us to tell us what's
###171 going on here, and no one wants to.
###173 So tonight is when it kicks off, and so we're just waiting
###178 to go up to the sort of mixed areas up by Ardoyne, where it
###182 was bad last year.
###184 And the police presence is going to be pretty heavy.
###186 And apparently that's when it's going to get a bit hairy.
###189 FEMALE SPEAKER: (SINGING) We will hear the people cry, let
###191 the POA go by, We are the pride of Ardoyne.
###198 MALE SPEAKER 1: Well, I disagree with the march or the
###200 parade being allowed to walk through the district that it
###204 does walk through, the road that it walks on, because of
###207 the symbolism that it deals with.
###209 In one case, they would carry a banner to a UVF man who had
###213 killed a Catholic.
###213 That, obviously, is about more than just symbolism.
###217 That's about rubbing your nose in it.
###218 MALE SPEAKER 2: The Loyalist position on that would be that
###220 it's a traditional route, it's historical.
###224 Obviously, I believe that there does need to be
###226 dialogue, and I think symbols and flags and songs that are
###231 deliberately designed to be provocative, that that
###234 certainly should be talked about.
###236 MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: Things are going slightly gnarlier.
###239 Packs of kids that we tried to talk to, who were drinking
###243 bottles of straight vodka and smoking weed on the street,
###246 got a little friendly with the camera and were a bit grabby.
###250 
###283 MICHAEL MOYNIHAN: So we've been-- we've been marching for
###286 a couple hours now, and we've passed city center, and I
###291 think it's time for us to peel off here and go find some
###294 Republicans.
###295 So we're gonna get the fuck out of here, because things
###297 are getting drunker and uglier.
