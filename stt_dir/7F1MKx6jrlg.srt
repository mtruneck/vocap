0:0:11,21 --> 0:0:14,313
NARRATOR: On this
episode of Wicked Tuna.


2
0:0:14,313 --> 0:0:16,348
WEATHERMAN: A bomb in our
coastal waters, a nor'easter.


3
0:0:16,348 --> 0:0:18,484
MARCIANO: Hard
weather's coming down.


4
0:0:18,484 --> 0:0:19,952
COAST GUARD: They've extended
the gale warning


5
0:0:19,952 --> 0:0:21,253
through the night.


6
0:0:21,253 --> 0:0:23,355
PAUL: We got a storm coming.


7
0:0:23,355 --> 0:0:24,39
DAVE CARRARO: Whoa.


8
0:0:24,39 --> 0:0:28,661
JAY: Yeah baby! Woo!


9
0:0:28,661 --> 0:0:31,464
MARCIANO: He's sinking the
boat, he's sinking the boat.


10
0:0:31,464 --> 0:0:33,365
RALPH: Reel that BLEEP
line in the back.


11
0:0:33,365 --> 0:0:35,768
No, the other line.


12
0:0:35,768 --> 0:0:38,571
The weather forecast
is not good.


13
0:0:38,571 --> 0:0:40,873
DAVE CARRARO: What are
you doing down there?


14
0:0:40,873 --> 0:0:42,475
I don't want to die out there.


15
0:0:42,475 --> 0:0:44,243
MARCIANO: Hey, something's
up with the engine up here.


16
0:0:44,243 --> 0:0:46,912
Last thing I want to happen is
to be stuck out here with an


17
0:0:46,912 --> 0:0:49,915
engine that won't start.
Son of a bxxch.


18
0:0:49,915 --> 0:0:52,118
NARRATOR: Fishing
is a hard life.


19
0:0:52,118 --> 0:0:53,819
RALPH: There's gonna be
a confrontation here.


20
0:0:53,819 --> 0:0:55,888
NARRATOR: And harder with
bluefin stocks depleted.


21
0:0:55,888 --> 0:0:58,858
In Gloucester, Massachusetts,
there's a special breed of


22
0:0:58,858 --> 0:1:1,727
fishermen, for generations
they've used rod and reel to


23
0:1:1,727 --> 0:1:4,13
catch the elusive Bluefin tuna.


24
0:1:4,13 --> 0:1:5,397
MARCIANO: Yeah, baby.


25
0:1:5,397 --> 0:1:7,166
NARRATOR: They depending
these fish for their survival.


26
0:1:7,166 --> 0:1:8,868
The competition is brutal.


27
0:1:8,868 --> 0:1:10,69
SCOTT: Miserable prick.


28
0:1:10,69 --> 0:1:17,61
NARRATOR: This is Wicked Tuna.


29
0:1:17,61 --> 0:1:20,513
DAVE CARRARO: Go. Go. It's
great to be on top,


30
0:1:20,513 --> 0:1:23,15
it's great to make all the
money, but with that nobody


31
0:1:23,15 --> 0:1:25,117
likes a winner.


32
0:1:25,117 --> 0:1:26,986
MARCIANO: For me, the money
doesn't fall out of the sky,


33
0:1:26,986 --> 0:1:28,787
it comes out of the sea.


34
0:1:28,787 --> 0:1:30,623
BILL: This gets harder
as you get older, but


35
0:1:30,623 --> 0:1:33,25
I'm keeping up with the young
guns. Get out of the way.


36
0:1:33,25 --> 0:1:34,927
RALPH: If it's on my mind,
you're gonna hear about it.


37
0:1:34,927 --> 0:1:50,309
If you did something to me, I'm
gonna do something back to you.


38
0:1:50,309 --> 0:1:52,611
There's only a few weeks left
to this season and


39
0:1:52,611 --> 0:1:54,68
the weather forecast
is not good.


40
0:1:54,68 --> 0:1:57,316
Stormy weather for
the next couple days.


41
0:1:57,316 --> 0:2:0,52
For me rough days is a good
opportunity to catch one.


42
0:2:0,52 --> 0:2:2,655
The people that just in general,
don't like to fish on rough


43
0:2:2,655 --> 0:2:5,958
days, they don't belong
in this business.


44
0:2:5,958 --> 0:2:12,264
The wind is coming,
yeah, I feel it.


45
0:2:12,264 --> 0:2:14,667
PIRATE: I turn around, and yell
at the captain, I says hey uh,


46
0:2:14,667 --> 0:2:17,203
we got the CG coming
up off our stern.


47
0:2:17,203 --> 0:2:20,839
RALPH: Well, the COAST GUARD in
many cases is there to help us.


48
0:2:20,839 --> 0:2:22,575
And they can also
save your life.


49
0:2:22,575 --> 0:2:24,176
PIRATE: A matter
of time, you know,


50
0:2:24,176 --> 0:2:26,45
they had a little rubber
boat out that way.


51
0:2:26,45 --> 0:2:32,318
RALPH: Got my paperwork.


52
0:2:32,318 --> 0:2:33,786
COAST GUARD: When was the
last time you were boarded?


53
0:2:33,786 --> 0:2:35,54
RALPH: About two weeks ago.


54
0:2:35,54 --> 0:2:36,355
COAST GUARD: I just wanted
to give you a heads up.


55
0:2:36,355 --> 0:2:38,157
They've extended the gale
warning through the night.


56
0:2:38,157 --> 0:2:41,927
So it's going to start getting
real snotty after noon.


57
0:2:41,927 --> 0:2:44,663
RALPH: We got to follow the sea
going home, so we'll be fine.


58
0:2:44,663 --> 0:2:46,298
COAST GUARD: How long are
you planning on staying out?


59
0:2:46,298 --> 0:2:48,4
RALPH: Probably till the
first tide change about one,


60
0:2:48,4 --> 0:2:49,702
two o'clock.


61
0:2:49,702 --> 0:2:51,67
coast guard was advising us that
the forecast had changed for


62
0:2:51,67 --> 0:2:52,938
the worse.


63
0:2:52,938 --> 0:2:54,673
COAST GUARD: Alright sir. Take
care. Make it home safely.


64
0:2:54,673 --> 0:2:57,776
RALPH: You guys too.
COAST GUARD: Have a good day.


65
0:2:57,776 --> 0:2:59,345
RALPH: See you later,
have a good trip.


66
0:2:59,345 --> 0:3:2,448
We appreciate that, but we
decided to stay as long as we


67
0:3:2,448 --> 0:3:12,524
could and ignore the
coast guard warnings.


68
0:3:12,524 --> 0:3:14,86
DAVE CARRARO: Tonight, east
wind, 15 to 20, gusts up to 30,


69
0:3:14,86 --> 0:3:16,128
seas three to five.


70
0:3:16,128 --> 0:3:20,165
Rain. Tomorrow, east wind,
15 to 20, gusts up to 35.


71
0:3:20,165 --> 0:3:22,434
Gusts up to 30,
seas four to six.


72
0:3:22,434 --> 0:3:23,602
PAUL: That's bad.


73
0:3:23,602 --> 0:3:25,571
DAVE CARRARO: Yeah, and
then on the outgoing tide,


74
0:3:25,571 --> 0:3:26,538
it's gonna stand up.


75
0:3:26,538 --> 0:3:27,673
PAUL: That's real bad.


76
0:3:27,673 --> 0:3:29,475
DAVE CARRARO: So we're gonna
stand up in the morning,


77
0:3:29,475 --> 0:3:30,409
want us to go back, just.


78
0:3:30,409 --> 0:3:31,577
PAUL: Absolutely.


79
0:3:31,577 --> 0:3:33,112
DAVE CARRARO: Take
off when we can.


80
0:3:33,112 --> 0:3:34,647
PAUL: Yep.
DAVE CARRARO: Relax.


81
0:3:34,647 --> 0:3:36,282
PAUL: Yep. The weather gets
ferocious, you know,


82
0:3:36,282 --> 0:3:38,617
it's really just no joke,
especially in this size boat.


83
0:3:38,617 --> 0:3:42,688
We're not big boats.
We're in 30-foot boats.


84
0:3:42,688 --> 0:3:45,391
For the weather we go out
in they're very small boats.


85
0:3:45,391 --> 0:3:47,726
DAVE CARRARO: We'll take,
uh, take tomorrow off,


86
0:3:47,726 --> 0:3:50,229
which we really, see where
we're BLEEP and we'll see,


87
0:3:50,229 --> 0:3:51,397
see if it changes.


88
0:3:51,397 --> 0:3:52,665
Now that we're gonna
go back to Gloucester,


89
0:3:52,665 --> 0:3:54,833
the weather's supposed to get
pretty lousy here BLEEP in


90
0:3:54,833 --> 0:3:56,35
the next couple days.


91
0:3:56,35 --> 0:3:57,87
So, it's supposed to
be real BLEEP tonight.


92
0:3:57,87 --> 0:3:59,438
As it is tomorrow
and the next day.


93
0:3:59,438 --> 0:4:1,573
I don't want to come out here
and get pounded for two days


94
0:4:1,573 --> 0:4:2,808
for a small fish.


95
0:4:2,808 --> 0:4:4,843
Yeah, we want to make money,
we want to have, you know,


96
0:4:4,843 --> 0:4:6,512
we want to catch fish,
we want to have fun.


97
0:4:6,512 --> 0:4:8,18
It's a point where it's too
extreme and it's unsafe,


98
0:4:8,18 --> 0:4:9,648
I don't wanna die out there.


99
0:4:9,648 --> 0:4:26,231
Be kind of nice to, to be home
and just catch up on things.


100
0:4:26,231 --> 0:4:28,133
NANCY: So you guys going out
tomorrow?


101
0:4:28,133 --> 0:4:30,469
I guess there's a
north eastern coming.


102
0:4:30,469 --> 0:4:32,571
MARCIANO: Yeah, well
we've been catching fish,


103
0:4:32,571 --> 0:4:33,972
we gotta make it happen.


104
0:4:33,972 --> 0:4:36,275
So we're having dinner, you
know, talking with Nance,


105
0:4:36,275 --> 0:4:38,977
and once in a while she does
express a little bit of concern


106
0:4:38,977 --> 0:4:41,28
for me. The weather's
been a little crappy.


107
0:4:41,28 --> 0:4:43,382
NANCY: You watching the
weather, though, right?


108
0:4:43,382 --> 0:4:44,717
MARCIANO: Yeah, of course
I'm watching the weather.


109
0:4:44,717 --> 0:4:46,18
We're gonna be able
to get the day in.


110
0:4:46,18 --> 0:4:48,32
I gotta make it happen before
I'm all out of tomorrows and


111
0:4:48,32 --> 0:4:49,588
the season's over. So.


112
0:4:49,588 --> 0:4:52,591
I imagine it's tough
on her being at home.


113
0:4:52,591 --> 0:4:55,26
But I have to remind her, you
know, I know what I'm doing.


114
0:4:55,26 --> 0:5:0,132
I just gotta do what's necessary
to get through the next week.


115
0:5:0,132 --> 0:5:2,868
I gotta do what I gotta do.
Like always.


116
0:5:2,868 --> 0:5:5,437
NANCY: I just worry about
you when you're out there.


117
0:5:5,437 --> 0:5:7,206
MARCIANO: Yeah, we'll be
fine, you know the deal.


118
0:5:7,206 --> 0:5:9,108
You know, if you've read
the book, or, you know,


119
0:5:9,108 --> 0:5:11,944
saw the movie Perfect
Storm, they got, you know,


120
0:5:11,944 --> 0:5:15,881
caught in weather that
was unanticipated.


121
0:5:15,881 --> 0:5:19,651
That's the same, you know,
scenario that you know,


122
0:5:19,651 --> 0:5:22,488
could happen to any one
of us at any given time.


123
0:5:22,488 --> 0:5:25,824
But, uh, this is
the job I chose, sometimes


124
0:5:25,824 --> 0:5:29,628
I just gotta do whatever
it takes to get a fish.


125
0:5:29,628 --> 0:5:31,563
You know, Joe's off to college,
I know we gotta make that


126
0:5:31,563 --> 0:5:33,298
tuition payment soon.


127
0:5:33,298 --> 0:5:35,134
Some of the other guys
might take the day off,


128
0:5:35,134 --> 0:5:36,702
but we're gonna go, you know.


129
0:5:36,702 --> 0:5:39,705
What choice do we have? It's
either go fish or go broke.


130
0:5:39,705 --> 0:5:42,341
Those are my options
so we're gonna go fish.


131
0:5:42,341 --> 0:5:44,51
Just like always.


132
0:5:44,51 --> 0:5:46,278
I can't do anything
about this weather.


133
0:5:46,278 --> 0:5:48,514
I can only hope
and do what I know.


134
0:5:48,514 --> 0:5:51,183
We need to catch a fish,
the bills are piling up.


135
0:5:51,183 --> 0:5:53,652
So we're gonna head right
back out there tomorrow,


136
0:5:53,652 --> 0:6:1,59
cause that's what I do.


137
0:6:1,59 --> 0:6:2,628
PAUL: There's a big storm
coming,


138
0:6:2,628 --> 0:6:4,263
gonna be here for
three or four days.


139
0:6:4,263 --> 0:6:7,32
REPORTER: Storms that could
be severe are moving in.


140
0:6:7,32 --> 0:6:9,201
WEATHERMAN: And here's
this huge storm.


141
0:6:9,201 --> 0:6:10,769
This is a classic nor'easter,
heavy rain and


142
0:6:10,769 --> 0:6:12,7
some thunderstorms.


143
0:6:12,7 --> 0:6:14,506
REPORTER: Five, six inches of
rain in two to three hours.


144
0:6:14,506 --> 0:6:16,175
PAUL: Gonna blow
40 miles an hour.


145
0:6:16,175 --> 0:6:29,822
WEATHERMAN: It's a bomb in our
coastal waters, a nor'easter.


146
0:6:29,822 --> 0:6:32,658
MARCIANO: This morning, this is
the exact kind of weather that


147
0:6:32,658 --> 0:6:34,626
the missus is worried about.


148
0:6:34,626 --> 0:6:37,529
But I gotta do what I gotta do
to make sure food gets on


149
0:6:37,529 --> 0:6:38,464
the table.


150
0:6:38,464 --> 0:6:39,998
I need a fish bad.


151
0:6:39,998 --> 0:6:43,101
The only weather that really
matters is whether you need it


152
0:6:43,101 --> 0:6:44,803
bad enough or not.


153
0:6:44,803 --> 0:6:47,372
It's red sky at night,
sailor's delight.


154
0:6:47,372 --> 0:6:51,677
Red sky in the morning,
sailors take warning.


155
0:6:51,677 --> 0:6:53,946
Hard weather's coming down.


156
0:6:53,946 --> 0:6:56,882
Jay and I are gonna tough
out this weather and head to


157
0:6:56,882 --> 0:7:0,686
Stellwagon Bank And its gonna
cost me about five hundred bucks


158
0:7:0,686 --> 0:7:2,221
for fuel, bait and ice.


159
0:7:2,221 --> 0:7:4,723
The reason we go in rough
weather is the bills


160
0:7:4,723 --> 0:7:6,425
gotta be paid.


161
0:7:6,425 --> 0:7:8,694
On a boat we call
that the Voon de face.


162
0:7:8,694 --> 0:7:10,829
JAY: That's my
jacket, that's not me.


163
0:7:10,829 --> 0:7:13,932
MARCIANO: Everybody gets a
little, a little grumpy when


164
0:7:13,932 --> 0:7:16,134
it's BLEEP out.


165
0:7:16,134 --> 0:7:18,604
Mother nature has a good way of
always throwing you that


166
0:7:18,604 --> 0:7:19,771
curve ball.


167
0:7:19,771 --> 0:7:22,908
Every time we go out, there
is the potential that


168
0:7:22,908 --> 0:7:24,71
we could not come home.


169
0:7:24,71 --> 0:7:27,713
Number one, let's hope this
weather doesn't hurt us any,


170
0:7:27,713 --> 0:7:29,815
well, the waves are
good, it makes noise,


171
0:7:29,815 --> 0:7:33,285
the noise of the ocean covers
up the noise of the boat.


172
0:7:33,285 --> 0:7:35,821
So we're hoping the fish
won't hear us out here,


173
0:7:35,821 --> 0:7:47,9
we'll be able to
hook a big one today.


174
0:7:47,9 --> 0:7:49,401
RALPH: It's gonna be
a crazy day out here today.


175
0:7:49,401 --> 0:7:52,671
PIRATE and I are gonna try our
luck out Stellwagen Bank.


176
0:7:52,671 --> 0:7:57,376
Hopefully this weather won't
keep us from getting there.


177
0:7:57,376 --> 0:7:59,44
Probably better off
staying around here cause


178
0:7:59,44 --> 0:8:1,446
we can fish in the windier
weather coming.


179
0:8:1,446 --> 0:8:3,949
Maybe I'm crazy for going
out on days like today.


180
0:8:3,949 --> 0:8:7,85
When it's blowing, I'm going.


181
0:8:7,85 --> 0:8:8,787
PIRATE: One of the captain's
favorite figure of speech he


182
0:8:8,787 --> 0:8:13,225
says all the time, if
it's blowing, we're going.


183
0:8:13,225 --> 0:8:15,561
RALPH: I dropped 500 on the trip
yesterday and I'm out here today


184
0:8:15,561 --> 0:8:21,767
spending 500 again, let's
just hope it pays off.


185
0:8:21,767 --> 0:8:23,802
RALPH: Some guys have
other sources of income.


186
0:8:23,802 --> 0:8:26,371
They don't need to fish on
days they're uncomfortable.


187
0:8:26,371 --> 0:8:29,141
For me, when I need
to catch giant tuna,


188
0:8:29,141 --> 0:8:31,243
I go if it's rough
or if it's calm.


189
0:8:31,243 --> 0:8:32,978
My boats leaking like a sieve.


190
0:8:32,978 --> 0:8:34,88
We haven't caught
anything in a while,


191
0:8:34,88 --> 0:8:37,382
so we'll have to stay out
here, but the tuna like


192
0:8:37,382 --> 0:8:38,417
the BLEEP weather.


193
0:8:38,417 --> 0:8:41,52
So hopefully it will
be to our advantage.


194
0:8:41,52 --> 0:8:43,855
Bluefin like to see
the disorientated bait.


195
0:8:43,855 --> 0:8:45,157
That's what they thrive on.


196
0:8:45,157 --> 0:8:49,27
They're feeding habits intensify
on rough oceans and it gives us,


197
0:8:49,27 --> 0:8:51,997
as the fishing boats, a
better chance to catch them.


198
0:8:51,997 --> 0:8:54,499
PIRATE: This is the only
weather that men go fishing in.


199
0:8:54,499 --> 0:8:57,869
Everybody else stays at the dock
and just dreams about coming out


200
0:8:57,869 --> 0:9:7,245
here and catching the fish.


201
0:9:7,245 --> 0:9:8,614
RALPH: Ready Pirate?
PIRATE: Yep.


202
0:9:8,614 --> 0:9:17,155
RALPH: Alright. Nasty. Ahh.


203
0:9:17,155 --> 0:9:20,892
Gonna be a crazy
day out here today.


204
0:9:20,892 --> 0:9:23,28
Maybe one other
boat, Dave Marciano,


205
0:9:23,28 --> 0:9:25,97
he's the only other crazy
fisherman that would be


206
0:9:25,97 --> 0:9:37,542
out here on a day like today.


207
0:9:37,542 --> 0:9:39,511
MARCIANO: The wind's
tough, tide's tough.


208
0:9:39,511 --> 0:9:42,648
Certainly not gonna
get it easy today.


209
0:9:42,648 --> 0:9:44,149
We've been out here at
Stellwagen Bank


210
0:9:44,149 --> 0:9:45,851
for a couple hours now.


211
0:9:45,851 --> 0:9:48,754
And the weather is brutal, but
the good news is we're seeing


212
0:9:48,754 --> 0:9:53,325
some tuna.


213
0:9:53,325 --> 0:9:55,93
Show a little back
bone will you?


214
0:9:55,93 --> 0:9:59,731
JAY: Sounds like them again.
Yeah, they came up to


215
0:9:59,731 --> 0:10:9,508
like eight, again, ten,
little above ten, eight.


216
0:10:9,508 --> 0:10:10,742
Ten fish on the
screen right now.


217
0:10:10,742 --> 0:10:12,77
We're gonna get a bite.
Come on.


218
0:10:12,77 --> 0:10:14,146
MARCIANO: Braving this weather
had better have been worth it.


219
0:10:14,146 --> 0:10:16,114
We can't keep spending
money on fuel and


220
0:10:16,114 --> 0:10:17,716
supplies without a catch.


221
0:10:17,716 --> 0:10:19,985
JAY: Go look at the machine.


222
0:10:19,985 --> 0:10:22,54
The screen looks
like fourth of July.


223
0:10:22,54 --> 0:10:25,49
MARCIANO: BLEEP mother lodes
here. I don't care if


224
0:10:25,49 --> 0:10:32,898
we bend a rod.


225
0:10:32,898 --> 0:10:36,668
JAY: Here we go, we're on.
We're on. I watched it.


226
0:10:36,668 --> 0:10:41,973
I watched it. This is a
screamer.


227
0:10:41,973 --> 0:10:45,1
Never turn the fish.
Never turn the fish.


228
0:10:45,1 --> 0:10:51,49
Yeah baby. Wooo. Wooo.


229
0:10:51,49 --> 0:10:53,218
MARCIANO: Let me know when the
water gets up to your ears.


230
0:10:53,218 --> 0:11:1,793
JAY: Wooo. Wooo.


231
0:11:1,793 --> 0:11:3,361
MARCIANO: The
weather was so rough,


232
0:11:3,361 --> 0:11:5,564
the waves were crashing up over
the deck and it was getting


233
0:11:5,564 --> 0:11:8,734
pretty deep on the boat,
which is a little bit hairy.


234
0:11:8,734 --> 0:11:11,203
He's sinking the boat,
he's sinking the boat.


235
0:11:11,203 --> 0:11:15,841
When I'm operating the boat, if
I simply just drive too fast,


236
0:11:15,841 --> 0:11:19,778
I'm gonna swamp the boat,
or simply lose the fish.


237
0:11:19,778 --> 0:11:22,948
There's a lot that
could go wrong here.


238
0:11:22,948 --> 0:11:25,65
JAY: Yeah baby.


239
0:11:25,65 --> 0:11:30,55
MARCIANO: He's gonna empty the
reel, he's gonna empty the reel!


240
0:11:30,55 --> 0:11:33,825
JAY: Hurry up, hurry up. Keep
going, keep going.


241
0:11:33,825 --> 0:11:36,728
Keep going. Keep going.


242
0:11:36,728 --> 0:11:40,332
MARCIANO: It takes a little
bit more skill, I think,


243
0:11:40,332 --> 0:11:43,235
to reel in a fish in
weather like this.


244
0:11:43,235 --> 0:11:45,337
You've gotta have
your game face on.


245
0:11:45,337 --> 0:11:48,206
You know, you can't let the
wind, the rain bother you.


246
0:11:48,206 --> 0:11:50,408
You just gotta pretend
none of that's there,


247
0:11:50,408 --> 0:11:52,11
and focus on that fish.


248
0:11:52,11 --> 0:11:53,812
JAY: Dave, my anchors
off the port side of us.


249
0:11:53,812 --> 0:11:55,313
MARCIANO: Yeah,
alright, get on here.


250
0:11:55,313 --> 0:11:58,83
JAY: Go. Watch the way it's
going.


251
0:11:58,83 --> 0:12:4,89
MARCIANO: Down on the bottom.
We might not ever BLEEP


252
0:12:4,89 --> 0:12:14,699
see this thing.


253
0:12:14,699 --> 0:12:15,934
JAY: Take it.


254
0:12:15,934 --> 0:12:17,35
MARCIANO: We got a big one.


255
0:12:17,35 --> 0:12:18,77
I'm worried about it,
he's pulling real hard,


256
0:12:18,77 --> 0:12:21,873
he's at the bottom of the sea,
and this weather really sucks.


257
0:12:21,873 --> 0:12:25,811
All of this could
spell disaster.


258
0:12:25,811 --> 0:12:27,45
Wow, he's a screamer.


259
0:12:27,45 --> 0:12:29,8
JAY: Yeah, he's a
pissed off fish.


260
0:12:29,8 --> 0:12:32,5
MARCIANO: Plain and simple.
You ain't got him till


261
0:12:32,5 --> 0:12:35,787
he's on the boat.


262
0:12:35,787 --> 0:12:39,457
Fine line and a slow hook
separating me from 10,000


263
0:12:39,457 --> 0:12:41,226
dollars right now.


264
0:12:41,226 --> 0:12:42,761
How you doing Jay, you good?


265
0:12:42,761 --> 0:12:46,31
JAY: Getting tired but, my arms
will just fall off before


266
0:12:46,31 --> 0:12:47,332
I stop.


267
0:12:47,332 --> 0:12:51,269
MARCIANO: We have to be real
aware of the fish and the waves,


268
0:12:51,269 --> 0:12:55,674
you know, that takes a lot of
communication between Jay and I.


269
0:12:55,674 --> 0:12:59,744
Alright Jay, I'll spell you.


270
0:12:59,744 --> 0:13:2,881
We haven't had a fish yet this
year that took that much line.


271
0:13:2,881 --> 0:13:4,182
We got a big one here.


272
0:13:4,182 --> 0:13:6,852
You know, this is gonna be at
least a 500 pound plus fish.


273
0:13:6,852 --> 0:13:9,754
And to be honest with you, I'm
a little bit worried with the


274
0:13:9,754 --> 0:13:11,223
weather conditions we got.


275
0:13:11,223 --> 0:13:14,226
We wound up about two miles from
the anchor before he finally


276
0:13:14,226 --> 0:13:16,928
stopped and we could start
to fight him a little.


277
0:13:16,928 --> 0:13:23,501
The first two miles we
were just following.


278
0:13:23,501 --> 0:13:27,172
RALPH: Looks like Marciano's
hooked up, unbelievable.


279
0:13:27,172 --> 0:13:33,879
Damn, that Tuna's giving
Marciano quite a battle.


280
0:13:33,879 --> 0:13:37,15
MARCIANO: It's a big
fish. Okay, get ready Jay.


281
0:13:37,15 --> 0:13:38,416
JAY: Big fish.


282
0:13:38,416 --> 0:13:39,951
MARCIANO: Out here,
get this leader Jay.


283
0:13:39,951 --> 0:13:41,419
Get the rod. Get the rod.


284
0:13:41,419 --> 0:13:42,554
Got it. Got it?


285
0:13:42,554 --> 0:13:43,955
JAY: Yep.


286
0:13:43,955 --> 0:13:47,259
MARCIANO: Pull it
up, pull him up.


287
0:13:47,259 --> 0:13:53,298
JAY: He's going, he's gone.


288
0:13:53,298 --> 0:14:0,772
MARCIANO: No he's not. Yeah,
tail's wrapped.


289
0:14:0,772 --> 0:14:3,475
BLEEP I almost had him and then
bam I dropped the gaff in the


290
0:14:3,475 --> 0:14:4,776
water, but I'm prepared.


291
0:14:4,776 --> 0:14:6,878
I'm like a boy scout, I had
another one close at hand.


292
0:14:6,878 --> 0:14:16,187
JAY: Up, up, up.
Pull it up.


293
0:14:16,187 --> 0:14:17,389
MARCIANO: There you
go Jay, get him.


294
0:14:17,389 --> 0:14:19,24
JAY: Good job, Dave.


295
0:14:19,24 --> 0:14:21,459
MARCIANO: Yeah, that's
what it's all about.


296
0:14:21,459 --> 0:14:26,765
700 pound fish,
now he sits there.


297
0:14:26,765 --> 0:14:31,136
RALPH: He got it. Damn.
JAY: That is a big fish.


298
0:14:31,136 --> 0:14:35,273
MARCIANO: There's only one way
we could make this day better


299
0:14:35,273 --> 0:14:44,15
and that's put one more
fish aboard this boat.


300
0:14:44,15 --> 0:14:46,151
RALPH: I still can't believe
Marciano managed to get a big


301
0:14:46,151 --> 0:14:50,622
fat tuna and we still
haven't seen anything.


302
0:14:50,622 --> 0:14:51,957
PIRATE: It's not
really funny man.


303
0:14:51,957 --> 0:14:54,359
I'm trying to get
some bait down here.


304
0:14:54,359 --> 0:14:56,127
RALPH: Man, it's cold out here.
BLEEP


305
0:14:56,127 --> 0:14:58,63
PIRATE: What' s the matter?
RALPH: It's cold back there!


306
0:14:58,63 --> 0:15:3,969
PIRATE: Really? BLEEP Didn't
notice that, can't feel nothing.


307
0:15:3,969 --> 0:15:11,276
Ahhhh, come here.


308
0:15:11,276 --> 0:15:29,861
Come here, one of you guys
in the pot today. Come here.


309
0:15:29,861 --> 0:15:34,132
MARCIANO: Almost anything we do
that is normally routine becomes


310
0:15:34,132 --> 0:15:37,2
dangerous when it's
this rough out.


311
0:15:37,2 --> 0:15:39,671
If you get a fish in this
kind of weather, you know,


312
0:15:39,671 --> 0:15:43,375
you've got an 800-pound wrecking
ball swinging in the air when


313
0:15:43,375 --> 0:15:45,76
we're hauling that
over the side.


314
0:15:45,76 --> 0:15:51,683
JAY: Coming in right now.


315
0:15:51,683 --> 0:15:53,852
MARCIANO: Now it's
official, he's in the boat.


316
0:15:53,852 --> 0:15:56,721
Always put his best side up.
I want the pretty side up.


317
0:15:56,721 --> 0:15:59,257
JAY: So the buyers see
the best side of the fish.


318
0:15:59,257 --> 0:16:3,194
MARCIANO: Exactly boss.
Definitely bigger than


319
0:16:3,194 --> 0:16:4,329
I thought.


320
0:16:4,329 --> 0:16:7,499
But that explains why he
was such a tough fighter.


321
0:16:7,499 --> 0:16:9,134
Oh, he is around.


322
0:16:9,134 --> 0:16:10,235
JAY: He is?


323
0:16:10,235 --> 0:16:12,137
MARCIANO: Maybe
he'll dress over six.


324
0:16:12,137 --> 0:16:13,405
JAY: Yeah.


325
0:16:13,405 --> 0:16:16,341
MARCIANO: Over the
rail and in the pail.


326
0:16:16,341 --> 0:16:18,51
One thing about these fish
here is they're warm blooded.


327
0:16:18,51 --> 0:16:22,914
During the fight, they
heat up internally.


328
0:16:22,914 --> 0:16:26,351
It's really important to get
those heart guts out and


329
0:16:26,351 --> 0:16:28,586
replace that with ice.


330
0:16:28,586 --> 0:16:32,29
And that's gonna bring you a top
quality piece of merchandise.


331
0:16:32,29 --> 0:16:44,235
Tails up.


332
0:16:44,235 --> 0:16:45,737
DAVE CARRARO: We've got quite
a few fish under our belt in


333
0:16:45,737 --> 0:16:47,806
the last couple weeks and the
weather's coming in and yeah,


334
0:16:47,806 --> 0:16:50,175
we're just gonna, we just, we
just agreed to catch up


335
0:16:50,175 --> 0:16:52,11
with some maintenance,
some much needed sleep and


336
0:16:52,11 --> 0:16:57,82
re-energize and just get ready
to go. Joe, no sinkers yet?


337
0:16:57,82 --> 0:17:1,786
JOE: Should be first part of
next week. I got sixes.


338
0:17:1,786 --> 0:17:5,56
DAVE CARRARO: No, not gonna
do it. Who's catching what?


339
0:17:5,56 --> 0:17:6,958
JOE: Word on the radio was that
Marciano hooked up to


340
0:17:6,958 --> 0:17:9,828
a big fish.
Heard it was an 800 pounder.


341
0:17:9,828 --> 0:17:11,93
DAVE CARRARO:
Marciano's unbelievable.


342
0:17:11,93 --> 0:17:13,731
There's no way somebody's
gonna out fish me.


343
0:17:13,731 --> 0:17:16,101
I'm gonna grab the guys head
out first thing in the morning,


344
0:17:16,101 --> 0:17:17,836
screw the weather. See you soon.


345
0:17:17,836 --> 0:17:19,37
JOE: Good luck.


346
0:17:19,37 --> 0:17:20,238
DAVE CARRARO: Be in in a
couple days to get more stuff.


347
0:17:20,238 --> 0:17:21,473
JOE: Alright, we'll
see you around.


348
0:17:21,473 --> 0:17:23,708
DAVE CARRARO: Thanks Joe.
Come on, let's go. Come on.


349
0:17:23,708 --> 0:17:28,379
JOE: See you Pickles.


350
0:17:28,379 --> 0:17:29,948
RALPH: It's been a real
frustrating day today,


351
0:17:29,948 --> 0:17:32,283
it's been birds, birds, birds.


352
0:17:32,283 --> 0:17:37,355
So we're gonna call it quits
today we gotta go home.


353
0:17:37,355 --> 0:17:41,559
Heading home the seas were, you
know, 20 to 25 feet with uh,


354
0:17:41,559 --> 0:17:44,562
white water four to five
feet on the top and


355
0:17:44,562 --> 0:17:47,232
each wave was a battle.


356
0:17:47,232 --> 0:17:50,168
Now we're gonna head into the
dock in this north east 30 knots


357
0:17:50,168 --> 0:17:53,838
and hopefully get out
of his wet rain suit.


358
0:17:53,838 --> 0:17:57,41
Tomorrow's another day.


359
0:17:57,41 --> 0:18:2,13
PIRATE: Ahhh. There's no
fooling around out here on a


360
0:18:2,13 --> 0:18:8,62
day like today.
Today's a nasty day out. Oww.


361
0:18:8,62 --> 0:18:10,622
RALPH: The wind is
blowing back there, huh?


362
0:18:10,622 --> 0:18:14,726
Just another day of nothing,
nothing but a lot of waves,


363
0:18:14,726 --> 0:18:18,29
wind and water.
Oh, another one.


364
0:18:18,29 --> 0:18:22,767
I'd rather be out here and mark
a couple and get my ass whooped


365
0:18:22,767 --> 0:18:26,37
then sitting at home watching
TV thinking missed something.


366
0:18:26,37 --> 0:18:28,473
PIRATE: I think my underwear
is soaking wet by now,


367
0:18:28,473 --> 0:18:31,876
so that's probably good
enough for me for today.


368
0:18:31,876 --> 0:18:35,28
Ahhh. That was a nail
biter. Wow.


369
0:18:35,28 --> 0:18:38,316
That was about like forty
feet up in the air right now.


370
0:18:38,316 --> 0:18:40,485
Holy Mackerel.


371
0:18:40,485 --> 0:18:42,554
RALPH: Maybe mother nature
got the best of me today,


372
0:18:42,554 --> 0:18:44,856
but I'm gonna keep coming back
at her and take everything


373
0:18:44,856 --> 0:18:57,702
she's got to throw at me.


374
0:18:57,702 --> 0:19:0,104
The storm is still on us, it
looks like it's gonna be here


375
0:19:0,104 --> 0:19:1,472
the rest of the week.


376
0:19:1,472 --> 0:19:3,441
If it's blowing
then we're going.


377
0:19:3,441 --> 0:19:5,944
While the charter boat guys
are home hugging their pillows,


378
0:19:5,944 --> 0:19:8,413
the commercial guys
are fishing every day,


379
0:19:8,413 --> 0:19:12,116
in all kinds of weather.


380
0:19:12,116 --> 0:19:15,486
Soaked again. Holy cow.


381
0:19:15,486 --> 0:19:19,123
They usually evacuate this
dock when it's like this.


382
0:19:19,123 --> 0:19:26,898
Sometimes when you get a big
storm your life could flash


383
0:19:26,898 --> 0:19:30,301
before your eyes, you know, you
think about all the good times


384
0:19:30,301 --> 0:19:33,771
and bad times that you've had
until then, and, you know,


385
0:19:33,771 --> 0:19:37,976
it's an eye opener of,
of life day to day. Oh.


386
0:19:37,976 --> 0:19:42,513
Bad weather, it always makes
it a little extra exciting.


387
0:19:42,513 --> 0:19:50,622
On top of being rough we
have uh, rain, fog, sog,


388
0:19:50,622 --> 0:19:54,292
all in all adds up to BLEEP.


389
0:19:54,292 --> 0:19:56,327
You know, you're a small
dot on a big sea, you know,


390
0:19:56,327 --> 0:20:5,37
anything could happen,
anything's possible.


391
0:20:5,37 --> 0:20:7,305
DAVE CARRARO: We're heading to
a spot where we've been catching


392
0:20:7,305 --> 0:20:9,874
some uh, big fish on
Jeffrey's Ledge and I'm uh,


393
0:20:9,874 --> 0:20:12,377
hoping to produce, and uh, do
the same as we've done before,


394
0:20:12,377 --> 0:20:13,544
catch a big one.


395
0:20:13,544 --> 0:20:14,979
It's supposed to get really,
really BLEEP today and


396
0:20:14,979 --> 0:20:16,814
we can't miss a bite.


397
0:20:16,814 --> 0:20:19,117
We gotta get them frenzied.


398
0:20:19,117 --> 0:20:21,85
We know how to handle
ourselves during this weather.


399
0:20:21,85 --> 0:20:27,959
PAUL: It's really BLEEP out.


400
0:20:27,959 --> 0:20:33,298
North east, it's blowing about
20 and it's gonna get worse.


401
0:20:33,298 --> 0:20:35,667
DAVE CARRARO: You know, when
it's rough out, that's when,


402
0:20:35,667 --> 0:20:38,2
that's when the BLEEP hits the
fan, that's when most of the uh,


403
0:20:38,2 --> 0:20:39,27
incidents, you know, do happen.


404
0:20:39,27 --> 0:20:41,639
We just slow down, work together
and just really, you know,


405
0:20:41,639 --> 0:20:43,708
stay alert, pay attention
to what we're doing.


406
0:20:43,708 --> 0:20:46,377
I don't want to die out there.


407
0:20:46,377 --> 0:20:55,32
PAUL: We got to
be careful today.


408
0:20:55,32 --> 0:21:0,224
MARCIANO: You need extra
strength foot powder for Jay's


409
0:21:0,224 --> 0:21:2,26
severe case of bromadrosis.


410
0:21:2,26 --> 0:21:6,3
JAY: Hey, you never know when
you're gonna see a girl out here


411
0:21:6,3 --> 0:21:8,199
MARCIANO: Famous words of
Frank Zappa, stink foot.


412
0:21:8,199 --> 0:21:9,967
JAY: Stink foot.


413
0:21:9,967 --> 0:21:12,136
MARCIANO: Since we caught
a fish here yesterday,


414
0:21:12,136 --> 0:21:14,972
we spent the night and we're
gonna see if we can pull that


415
0:21:14,972 --> 0:21:16,841
trick off again today.


416
0:21:16,841 --> 0:21:18,976
I'm truly hoping that
being out in this BLEEP weather


417
0:21:18,976 --> 0:21:20,244
pays off for us.


418
0:21:20,244 --> 0:21:22,747
We need the money a good
catch would bring in, badly.


419
0:21:22,747 --> 0:21:27,685
You know, the quota's due
to be met any day now,


420
0:21:27,685 --> 0:21:30,388
so we're really hoping to slip
one more in before that quota's


421
0:21:30,388 --> 0:21:34,459
caught up for the season
and the fishery closes.


422
0:21:34,459 --> 0:21:36,461
Come on, Jay, chum
one up, will you?


423
0:21:36,461 --> 0:21:37,662
JAY: It's always my fault.


424
0:21:37,662 --> 0:21:39,3
MARCIANO: What are you
working for, dot com, or what?


425
0:21:39,3 --> 0:21:42,367
JAY: No, I'm not working for
dot com. I'm working for you.


426
0:21:42,367 --> 0:21:43,935
MARCIANO: How come
there's no fish here?


427
0:21:43,935 --> 0:21:48,206
DAVE CARRARO: Come up Dave?
MARCIANO: Yeah, go ahead.


428
0:21:48,206 --> 0:21:50,308
DAVE CARRARO: Yeah, there
you go, what's going on?


429
0:21:50,308 --> 0:21:53,378
MARCIANO: Not much, not much.
Water is BLEEP here today.


430
0:21:53,378 --> 0:21:56,714
I had high hopes for this place,
we had the bite yesterday.


431
0:21:56,714 --> 0:21:58,75
DAVE CARRARO: Yeah, I
heard about that, congrats.


432
0:21:58,75 --> 0:22:0,518
Where you guys at today?


433
0:22:0,518 --> 0:22:2,286
MARCIANO: We're where
we were yesterday.


434
0:22:2,286 --> 0:22:3,788
Out on Jeffrey's ledge.


435
0:22:3,788 --> 0:22:5,757
DAVE CARRARO: Alright, I'll
chat with you in a while.


436
0:22:5,757 --> 0:22:7,725
MARCIANO: Alright
Dave, standing by.


437
0:22:7,725 --> 0:22:11,229
Tricky Dave of the dot com is up
to no good trying to figure out


438
0:22:11,229 --> 0:22:13,698
where I'm anchored right
now because that fish


439
0:22:13,698 --> 0:22:15,233
we caught yesterday.


440
0:22:15,233 --> 0:22:17,869
I gave him a little
bit of misinformation,


441
0:22:17,869 --> 0:22:19,904
I told him we were
at Jeffrey's Ledge,


442
0:22:19,904 --> 0:22:22,173
but we're really at Stellwagen.


443
0:22:22,173 --> 0:22:25,209
Dave is Dave and I'm still
feeling him out,


444
0:22:25,209 --> 0:22:41,626
the jury's still out on him.


445
0:22:41,626 --> 0:22:45,229
RALPH: This is the
tidal rip right here. Oh.


446
0:22:45,229 --> 0:22:48,499
Tide's gonna change
right after this.


447
0:22:48,499 --> 0:22:51,302
These storms are crazy, you get
little pockets of nice weather


448
0:22:51,302 --> 0:22:54,105
and then all of a sudden the
weather turns to BLEEP again.


449
0:22:54,105 --> 0:22:55,807
There's a break in
the weather and,


450
0:22:55,807 --> 0:22:57,809
and at this time of the season
we want to stay out there as


451
0:22:57,809 --> 0:23:4,816
long as we can and get a fish.


452
0:23:4,816 --> 0:23:8,853
Reel this one in, give
me some rubber bands.


453
0:23:8,853 --> 0:23:11,322
My eyes are focused on the
machine and the radio up in the


454
0:23:11,322 --> 0:23:17,428
bow and PIRATE's responsible
for everything in the stern.


455
0:23:17,428 --> 0:23:18,996
Reel in that line in the back!


456
0:23:18,996 --> 0:23:24,469
Reel in that BLEEP line in the
back. No, the other line!


457
0:23:24,469 --> 0:23:26,671
PIRATE: wasn't paying
attention on the tide change,


458
0:23:26,671 --> 0:23:30,441
then we got a big tangle, one
of the lines got scraped on


459
0:23:30,441 --> 0:23:31,676
the keel of the boat.


460
0:23:31,676 --> 0:23:33,44
I'm thinking, what now.


461
0:23:33,44 --> 0:23:34,579
We don't need more
BLEEP to deal with.


462
0:23:34,579 --> 0:23:35,813
This weather is enough.


463
0:23:35,813 --> 0:23:38,82
What the BLEEP you standing
inside looking at me for?


464
0:23:38,82 --> 0:23:40,384
PIRATE: When there's a
storm coming the tension


465
0:23:40,384 --> 0:23:41,519
really goes up.


466
0:23:41,519 --> 0:23:49,193
The little things
erupt into big things.


467
0:23:49,193 --> 0:23:50,862
RALPH: Pay attention
while this is going on.


468
0:23:50,862 --> 0:23:53,13
Don't let that line
go under the boat.


469
0:23:53,13 --> 0:24:1,572
Right there. Stop.
Right there. Stop.


470
0:24:1,572 --> 0:24:15,853
MARCIANO: That blue rod's gonna
go. We're on! Okay.


471
0:24:15,853 --> 0:24:17,655
JAY: You want to do it?
MARCIANO: We unclip? Nope.


472
0:24:17,655 --> 0:24:29,5
He's gut hooked,
or he's gill hooked,


473
0:24:29,5 --> 0:24:31,636
which is never a good thing.


474
0:24:31,636 --> 0:24:33,638
I could tell this fish
is gill hooked, you know,


475
0:24:33,638 --> 0:24:36,607
the way he keeps coming at me
and the line keeps going slack,


476
0:24:36,607 --> 0:24:40,611
he's shaking his head.


477
0:24:40,611 --> 0:24:50,121
He's gone. Pulled hook,
and it's over that easy.


478
0:24:50,121 --> 0:24:52,29
JAY: That sucks.


479
0:24:52,29 --> 0:24:54,859
MARCIANO: Fortunately,
we have one on the boat,


480
0:24:54,859 --> 0:25:2,99
losing a fish is never a good
thing, but that's not permanent,


481
0:25:2,99 --> 0:25:19,817
this on the other hand,
now that, that's permanent.


482
0:25:19,817 --> 0:25:23,12
PAUL: That's what I like,
nasty, BLEEP weather.


483
0:25:23,12 --> 0:25:26,39
Well, they usually feed
good when it's rough.


484
0:25:26,39 --> 0:25:28,759
They frenzy out,
they feed better.


485
0:25:28,759 --> 0:25:34,365
Plus, it's better for us too.
It's gray out, it's dark out.


486
0:25:34,365 --> 0:25:38,402
The lines are hidden better.
Tuna fisherman advantage today.


487
0:25:38,402 --> 0:25:40,304
DAVE CARRARO: Winds supposed to
be increasing here throughout


488
0:25:40,304 --> 0:25:41,138
the day.


489
0:25:41,138 --> 0:25:42,473
It's only blowing 10 to 15 now.


490
0:25:42,473 --> 0:25:43,874
It's supposed to blow
harder this afternoon,


491
0:25:43,874 --> 0:25:46,177
so it's gonna get a
little snotty out here.


492
0:25:46,177 --> 0:25:47,945
I hope Marciano's
catch wasn't a fluke,


493
0:25:47,945 --> 0:25:50,14
it's gonna be irritating
if I've wasted my time and


494
0:25:50,14 --> 0:25:52,817
energy coming out here today.


495
0:25:52,817 --> 0:25:56,52
That's it, man, we're all set
up, putting one more bait out.


496
0:25:56,52 --> 0:26:4,395
Bait out and wait it out.
That's it.


497
0:26:4,395 --> 0:26:6,831
That's a big ass fish right
there. Right there.


498
0:26:6,831 --> 0:26:8,566
PAUL: Yeah, off
to the side. See they hurry.


499
0:26:8,566 --> 0:26:11,235
DAVE CARRARO: Yes they are,
coming up, came up from 120,


500
0:26:11,235 --> 0:26:12,97
came up to 90.


501
0:26:12,97 --> 0:26:16,7
So there you go, you never
know, that might be our


502
0:26:16,7 --> 0:26:17,241
1,100 pounder right there.


503
0:26:17,241 --> 0:26:18,376
I'm going in the back.


504
0:26:18,376 --> 0:26:19,61
PAUL: Here he comes again.
DAVE CARRARO: Really?


505
0:26:19,61 --> 0:26:20,745
PAUL: Yeah.


506
0:26:20,745 --> 0:26:22,413
DAVE CARRARO: Come
on, get out, get out.


507
0:26:22,413 --> 0:26:24,782
PAUL: Nice big one. Big
blob. You know.


508
0:26:24,782 --> 0:26:26,584
DAVE CARRARO: That's
nice, that's a big boy.


509
0:26:26,584 --> 0:26:29,86
I'm marking another one,
and it starts raining,


510
0:26:29,86 --> 0:26:47,505
hopefully this Tuna
likes the rain. [BEEP]


511
0:26:47,505 --> 0:26:49,707
PAUL: Got him, we got him.


512
0:26:49,707 --> 0:26:55,79
DAVE CARRARO: Forward left.
Forward left. Bring him around.


513
0:26:55,79 --> 0:27:0,117
PAUL: Hold on.
SANDRO How you doing Paul?


514
0:27:0,117 --> 0:27:2,86
DAVE CARRARO: Come
here you bitch.


515
0:27:2,86 --> 0:27:6,23
Stay down sea, Sandro.


516
0:27:6,23 --> 0:27:10,828
It's nasty out, wind's
coming up 25, 30 knots.


517
0:27:10,828 --> 0:27:13,998
BLEEP rough.
Okay, forward left.


518
0:27:13,998 --> 0:27:16,901
PAUL: It's really hard
to work when it's rough.


519
0:27:16,901 --> 0:27:20,571
DAVE CARRARO: Bring it around.
PAUL: It's tough fishing.


520
0:27:20,571 --> 0:27:24,275
DAVE CARRARO: We're losing it.
Hurry, hurry, he's getting away.


521
0:27:24,275 --> 0:27:25,543
Go, go, go.


522
0:27:25,543 --> 0:27:26,544
PAUL: Got him, get him,
get him. Get him, get the work!


523
0:27:26,544 --> 0:27:36,62
DAVE CARRARO: We're
gonna lose it.


524
0:27:36,62 --> 0:27:38,322
Come back a little Sandro.


525
0:27:38,322 --> 0:27:40,524
PAUL: Yeah, nice.
Thank you.


526
0:27:40,524 --> 0:27:44,128
DAVE CARRARO: Keep it down sea
good job. Forward.


527
0:27:44,128 --> 0:27:47,665
Neutral, sinker, swivel
here in a second.


528
0:27:47,665 --> 0:27:51,869
Coming up soon.
Get a good look at him.


529
0:27:51,869 --> 0:27:54,872
Color. There it is.


530
0:27:54,872 --> 0:27:58,275
PAUL: Big blue baby.


531
0:27:58,275 --> 0:28:3,781
DAVE CARRARO: Neutral. Neutral.
Gonna measure. Got one.


532
0:28:3,781 --> 0:28:5,716
PAUL: He's a keeper.


533
0:28:5,716 --> 0:28:8,719
DAVE CARRARO: Keep bopping,
I'm gonna back off. So gaf.


534
0:28:8,719 --> 0:28:12,656
PAUL: Alright, keep going.


535
0:28:12,656 --> 0:28:15,659
DAVE CARRARO: Forward, forward.
You're okay.


536
0:28:15,659 --> 0:28:18,529
PAUL: Oh, he burnt my
hands, the little prick.


537
0:28:18,529 --> 0:28:20,631
Little bastard burnt
my BLEEP hands.


538
0:28:20,631 --> 0:28:24,668
DAVE CARRARO: Little bitch.
PAUL: Little bitch.


539
0:28:24,668 --> 0:28:26,337
DAVE CARRARO: Here he comes.
There he comes.


540
0:28:26,337 --> 0:28:27,571
Ready, forward, just a touch.


541
0:28:27,571 --> 0:28:29,473
PAUL: Right in the tail
down back, yep, nice. Got him.


542
0:28:29,473 --> 0:28:31,609
DAVE CARRARO: I don't know
if I got. I don't know if I


543
0:28:31,609 --> 0:28:34,78
PAUL: You got him, right?


544
0:28:34,78 --> 0:28:36,781
DAVE CARRARO: I got
the harpoon line.


545
0:28:36,781 --> 0:28:38,849
PAUL: Okay.
DAVE CARRARO: Here we go.


546
0:28:38,849 --> 0:28:40,184
PAUL: Got one.


547
0:28:40,184 --> 0:28:41,418
DAVE CARRARO: Got one. That's a
300-pound fish right there.


548
0:28:41,418 --> 0:28:43,387
It'll bring between
three and 4,000 dollars.


549
0:28:43,387 --> 0:28:47,458
PAUL: Good job, he's all bled
out. Let's get another one.


550
0:28:47,458 --> 0:28:54,765
DAVE CARRARO: Let's
get another one.


551
0:28:54,765 --> 0:28:56,167
MARCIANO: Alright
Jay, hey listen,


552
0:28:56,167 --> 0:28:57,735
this storm's coming down
pretty quick here, let's,


553
0:28:57,735 --> 0:29:4,575
let's haul that anchor and
get the hell out of here.


554
0:29:4,575 --> 0:29:9,313
My battery's so low.
Dammit.


555
0:29:9,313 --> 0:29:11,248
I wonder what the BLEEP
the problem is now here.


556
0:29:11,248 --> 0:29:16,854
It should go right over.
This ain't good.


557
0:29:16,854 --> 0:29:20,624
Dammit Jay seems like we,
uh, we got a problem here.


558
0:29:20,624 --> 0:29:27,231
Hang on a minute let me see
if I can figure this out.


559
0:29:27,231 --> 0:29:38,75
Yeah, Tuna.com, you on
there sneaky Dave, come in.


560
0:29:38,75 --> 0:29:52,857
DAVE CARRARO: Look at that one.
Whoa. Wow. Hold on. Hold on.


561
0:29:52,857 --> 0:29:54,391
Yeah, we'll get
out of here soon.


562
0:29:54,391 --> 0:29:56,26
It's gonna be tough
pulling this anchor,


563
0:29:56,26 --> 0:29:58,62
we gotta be really careful.


564
0:29:58,62 --> 0:29:59,563
SANDRO: Yeah.


565
0:29:59,563 --> 0:30:1,365
DAVE CARRARO: So, we'll
stick it out till uh,


566
0:30:1,365 --> 0:30:3,467
after the tide change,
then we'll get out of here.


567
0:30:3,467 --> 0:30:4,602
SANDRO: Checking out.


568
0:30:4,602 --> 0:30:6,3
DAVE CARRARO: I've been
in a lot worse than this.


569
0:30:6,3 --> 0:30:9,73
When that wind comes up and the
ocean gets big, it's a violent,


570
0:30:9,73 --> 0:30:12,943
violent place to be in, I mean,
just one minute you're sitting


571
0:30:12,943 --> 0:30:15,12
there drinking your coffee,
eating your sandwich,


572
0:30:15,12 --> 0:30:18,115
next minute a wave comes and
takes the boat sideways and


573
0:30:18,115 --> 0:30:20,885
you're, you're under water.


574
0:30:20,885 --> 0:30:22,786
Get a bite any time, and
even if we do hook up,


575
0:30:22,786 --> 0:30:28,893
it's gonna be tough to get them.


576
0:30:28,893 --> 0:30:33,33
What are you doing down there?
He's holding on.


577
0:30:33,33 --> 0:30:54,852
He's got two hands pinned
on the side. Whoa. Hold on.


578
0:30:54,852 --> 0:30:56,887
EVA: What's ten less than 75.


579
0:30:56,887 --> 0:30:59,957
NANCY: Well, you've
just got to subtract.


580
0:30:59,957 --> 0:31:1,659
EVA: 65?


581
0:31:1,659 --> 0:31:7,965
NANCY: Yep, excellent.
That's a tricky one.


582
0:31:7,965 --> 0:31:11,502
David left Wednesday morning
and we've been waiting.


583
0:31:11,502 --> 0:31:14,872
It's, this is, like, it's
been the longest, but I,


584
0:31:14,872 --> 0:31:18,842
we're hoping he just stayed out
to catch a fish and hoping he's


585
0:31:18,842 --> 0:31:29,753
okay and just want to hear
him, that he's good and, yeah.


586
0:31:29,753 --> 0:31:40,13
So. Well, you have to
take ten minus 106.


587
0:31:40,13 --> 0:31:42,32
MARCIANO: Right now the
engine won't turn over,


588
0:31:42,32 --> 0:31:45,135
I can't seem to raise
anybody on the radio and uh,


589
0:31:45,135 --> 0:31:49,206
we got this bad weather
coming down on us.


590
0:31:49,206 --> 0:31:52,643
Such a pain in the ass.
The worst could happen.


591
0:31:52,643 --> 0:31:54,878
We could have a
disaster out there,


592
0:31:54,878 --> 0:31:58,449
like when the boat sank uh,
from under me in my old boat,


593
0:31:58,449 --> 0:32:0,584
the Angelica Joseph.


594
0:32:0,584 --> 0:32:2,286
What the BLEEP we
got going on here?


595
0:32:2,286 --> 0:32:4,288
Well, the boat was sinking
and I was treading water and


596
0:32:4,288 --> 0:32:7,324
watching her kind of slip under
the waves, you know,


597
0:32:7,324 --> 0:32:10,894
what was going through
my mind at the time was,


598
0:32:10,894 --> 0:32:13,53
how was my family gonna
get by without me.


599
0:32:13,53 --> 0:32:23,14
It was who's gonna take care
of them. Son of a bxxch.


600
0:32:23,14 --> 0:32:37,821
Come in, can you hear me?
Any of you guys out here?


601
0:32:37,821 --> 0:32:41,925
BLEEP I got to figure this
out here. Damnit.


602
0:32:41,925 --> 0:32:43,727
We're having some
engine trouble here.


603
0:32:43,727 --> 0:32:46,3
At this point, I'm not exactly
sure what the hell


604
0:32:46,3 --> 0:32:54,71
I'm gonna do. Alright.


605
0:32:54,71 --> 0:33:6,65
If this don't work this time,
we're out of BLEEP options.


606
0:33:6,65 --> 0:33:10,754
It's a miracle.
And just like that it's over.


607
0:33:10,754 --> 0:33:14,291
Alright Jay, we lucked out here.
I got this BLEEP thing running.


608
0:33:14,291 --> 0:33:18,362
And the truth is, after
that little scare,


609
0:33:18,362 --> 0:33:20,731
I was ready to get
back to my family.


610
0:33:20,731 --> 0:33:27,905
Let's get out of here.


611
0:33:27,905 --> 0:33:29,64
DAVE CARRARO: You want to
get out of here, or what?


612
0:33:29,64 --> 0:33:31,241
SANDRO: I'm down for whatever.
DAVE CARRARO: Huh?


613
0:33:31,241 --> 0:33:32,576
SANDRO I'm down for
whatever you wanna do.


614
0:33:32,576 --> 0:33:33,61
DAVE CARRARO: Go home?


615
0:33:33,61 --> 0:33:34,812
PAUL: You're down
with anything, man.


616
0:33:34,812 --> 0:33:36,113
SANDRO: We'll do
whatever you want.


617
0:33:36,113 --> 0:33:38,48
DAVE CARRARO: Wash
up, go get some beers.


618
0:33:38,48 --> 0:33:39,316
SANDRO: Yeah.


619
0:33:39,316 --> 0:33:40,684
DAVE CARRARO: Hot food, soup.
It's just too rough today,


620
0:33:40,684 --> 0:33:42,486
it's, ah, we're not marking any
fish.


621
0:33:42,486 --> 0:33:43,987
The wind's just
coming up too strong.


622
0:33:43,987 --> 0:33:45,722
It's a point where it's too
extreme and it's unsafe,


623
0:33:45,722 --> 0:33:47,424
you know, we're not,
I want to come home,


624
0:33:47,424 --> 0:33:48,559
I don't want to die out there.


625
0:33:48,559 --> 0:33:50,394
And, ah, you know, you
push the limits sometimes,


626
0:33:50,394 --> 0:33:51,862
one day it's gonna come up and
bite you in the ass and


627
0:33:51,862 --> 0:33:53,697
you're not gonna come home.


628
0:33:53,697 --> 0:33:55,999
PAUL: Hold on.


629
0:33:55,999 --> 0:33:57,234
DAVE CARRARO: Come on,
let's get out of here.


630
0:33:57,234 --> 0:33:58,569
We'll pack it in slow.


631
0:33:58,569 --> 0:34:0,437
Now I'm, I'm ready to throw in
the towel today. I'm...


632
0:34:0,437 --> 0:34:3,107
SANDRO: Yeah, let's
get out of here.


633
0:34:3,107 --> 0:34:5,876
Beer sounds good though.


634
0:34:5,876 --> 0:34:8,679
DAVE CARRARO: Yep, so the guys
went home already and


635
0:34:8,679 --> 0:34:11,348
we're gonna follow suit.


636
0:34:11,348 --> 0:34:13,217
Like I said, it's just
getting worse and worse here.


637
0:34:13,217 --> 0:34:20,491
Well, a warm bed
sounds good to me.


638
0:34:20,491 --> 0:34:22,926
MARCIANO: It's just like that,
somebody turned the fan on and


639
0:34:22,926 --> 0:34:25,996
the storm broke, you never know
with this New England weather,


640
0:34:25,996 --> 0:34:28,932
you know, but that's how
it happens a lot of times.


641
0:34:28,932 --> 0:34:30,567
NANCY: You gonna
give poppa a big hug?


642
0:34:30,567 --> 0:34:31,935
EVA: Is he coming?


643
0:34:31,935 --> 0:34:38,642
NANCY: Uh, he should
be on his way, dear.


644
0:34:38,642 --> 0:34:40,978
MARCIANO: All right. I'm glad
that BLEEP ride's over with.


645
0:34:40,978 --> 0:34:43,347
Being that we're such
a close-knit family,


646
0:34:43,347 --> 0:34:45,782
for me to disappear for
days on end, you know,


647
0:34:45,782 --> 0:34:49,553
sometimes four or five days,
that's tough on any family.


648
0:34:49,553 --> 0:34:51,889
The good news is, you
know, by staying out,


649
0:34:51,889 --> 0:34:55,125
we saved a lot of money in fuel
and a little bit of tackle.


650
0:34:55,125 --> 0:34:58,896
NANCY: Yeah, the boys are in.


651
0:34:58,896 --> 0:35:0,3
CINDY: Welcome home.


652
0:35:0,3 --> 0:35:2,966
Welcome back to Gloucester,
Massachusetts.


653
0:35:2,966 --> 0:35:4,801
So happy you returned.
Safe and sound.


654
0:35:4,801 --> 0:35:6,303
NANCY: Wow.


655
0:35:6,303 --> 0:35:13,844
CINDY: Wow. Look at how pretty.
Oh, wow. Oh huh.


656
0:35:13,844 --> 0:35:16,88
Pretty, pretty.
Love it. Love it.


657
0:35:16,88 --> 0:35:18,482
NANCY: We came for
hugs, you know.


658
0:35:18,482 --> 0:35:19,383
MARCIANO: Okay. Alright.


659
0:35:19,383 --> 0:35:22,553
NANCY: Mwah. Mwah.
You smell good.


660
0:35:22,553 --> 0:35:24,388
JAY: Love you.
CINDY: Ah, nephew, Jason.


661
0:35:24,388 --> 0:35:27,558
ROXANE: I, I said
where's my Jason.


662
0:35:27,558 --> 0:35:28,592
CINDY: Oh, honey.


663
0:35:28,592 --> 0:35:29,927
MARCIANO: Now, Jay,
don't make any plans,


664
0:35:29,927 --> 0:35:32,196
we'll be going
right back out, son.


665
0:35:32,196 --> 0:35:39,203
NANCY: Wow. Look at you.
CINDY: Yeah, going on the wall.


666
0:35:39,203 --> 0:35:41,371
NANCY: Look at you.
CINDY: Going on the wall.


667
0:35:41,371 --> 0:35:43,6
MARCIANO: I try and make up
for it and do all those special


668
0:35:43,6 --> 0:35:45,42
things with each member
of the family, um,


669
0:35:45,42 --> 0:35:47,377
so we get that
quality time and, ah,


670
0:35:47,377 --> 0:35:50,414
try and keep that
family unit together.


671
0:35:50,414 --> 0:35:52,216
How's the market been?


672
0:35:52,216 --> 0:35:53,884
MAN: The market
was weak yesterday.


673
0:35:53,884 --> 0:35:56,53
MARCIANO: Yeah, I heard guys
pissing and moaning on


674
0:35:56,53 --> 0:35:57,154
the way home.


675
0:35:57,154 --> 0:35:58,589
And what about that
domestic market?


676
0:35:58,589 --> 0:36:1,225
MAN: Okay, we move, we
moved some fish today.


677
0:36:1,225 --> 0:36:2,893
MARCIANO: All right.
MAN: Domestically.


678
0:36:2,893 --> 0:36:4,795
MARCIANO: Well you guys know
the deal, I'm starving to death,


679
0:36:4,795 --> 0:36:6,73
so the best we can do.


680
0:36:6,73 --> 0:36:9,32
MAN: Absolutely.
We always do for you.


681
0:36:9,32 --> 0:36:10,467
MARCIANO: So I can go, I can't
even write a check for fuel


682
0:36:10,467 --> 0:36:12,436
right now.
MAN: Alright, take care.


683
0:36:12,436 --> 0:36:14,104
MARCIANO: The weather's
been a little BLEEP lately,


684
0:36:14,104 --> 0:36:16,373
but that's the name
of the game, you know,


685
0:36:16,373 --> 0:36:17,708
sometimes if you want
to make a paycheck,


686
0:36:17,708 --> 0:36:19,776
you're gonna get spanked
around a little bit.


687
0:36:19,776 --> 0:36:21,912
You know the deal,
we're going, ah,


688
0:36:21,912 --> 0:36:24,314
we're probably leaving the day
after tomorrow actually, ah,


689
0:36:24,314 --> 0:36:25,682
maybe even tomorrow,
I don't know,


690
0:36:25,682 --> 0:36:26,984
we gotta listen to the weather.
We just got in.


691
0:36:26,984 --> 0:36:28,318
We just got to figure it out.


692
0:36:28,318 --> 0:36:29,686
NANCY: Yep.


693
0:36:29,686 --> 0:36:32,189
MARCIANO: And that's it, we may
be bound tomorrow morning again.


694
0:36:32,189 --> 0:36:33,557
NANCY: Alright, you
gonna go out way out.


695
0:36:33,557 --> 0:36:34,791
MARCIANO: We're
going back out there.


696
0:36:34,791 --> 0:36:36,59
NANCY: Oh, you are?


697
0:36:36,59 --> 0:36:37,494
MARCIANO: It's the, it's the
only game in town right now.


698
0:36:37,494 --> 0:36:38,629
NANCY: Is...


699
0:36:38,629 --> 0:36:40,13
MARCIANO: Back to hell
for another week, I guess.


700
0:36:40,13 --> 0:36:41,965
The bottom line is, I'm
doing this for my family.


701
0:36:41,965 --> 0:36:43,433
You know, I love my job.


702
0:36:43,433 --> 0:36:46,27
I love to be able to come
out here and do it, you know,


703
0:36:46,27 --> 0:36:58,181
just so I can give them
the best I possibly can.


704
0:36:58,181 --> 0:37:0,15
RALPH: There's some fish around,
that's for sure.


705
0:37:0,15 --> 0:37:1,985
That's him up there at 35 feet.


706
0:37:1,985 --> 0:37:4,521
I'll fight the storm if it means
a big tuna is gonna be on


707
0:37:4,521 --> 0:37:6,23
the end of my rod.


708
0:37:6,23 --> 0:37:8,558
I think he might be up there.
The weather's not gonna stop me.


709
0:37:8,558 --> 0:37:15,632
We're gonna stay out here as
long as it takes to get a fish.


710
0:37:15,632 --> 0:37:18,402
Let's get a slob on
the chum now, Pirate.


711
0:37:18,402 --> 0:37:19,67
It's BLEEP conditions today.
Huh?


712
0:37:19,67 --> 0:37:21,805
PIRATE: Oh, we're
soaked to the butt hole.


713
0:37:21,805 --> 0:37:25,208
RALPH: Fishing on a rough
day, it may not be comfortable


714
0:37:25,208 --> 0:37:28,712
fishing, but, that's when I have
the most confidence that the,


715
0:37:28,712 --> 0:37:32,482
the fish that come under
the boat will bite.


716
0:37:32,482 --> 0:37:36,653
PIRATE: Tucked away in
my nice little corner.


717
0:37:36,653 --> 0:37:38,121
Captain seemed to
think that, ah,


718
0:37:38,121 --> 0:37:39,956
the rougher weather
brings the tuna fish in.


719
0:37:39,956 --> 0:37:55,38
We should get a better chance
of maybe, ah, catching a fish.


720
0:37:55,38 --> 0:37:58,608
Fish on. Fish on.


721
0:37:58,608 --> 0:38:0,844
RALPH: Oh, yeah, he's there.
He's there.


722
0:38:0,844 --> 0:38:3,48
Get rid of these other rods.


723
0:38:3,48 --> 0:38:8,852
PIRATE: These rubber band
won't break on us then. Ah.


724
0:38:8,852 --> 0:38:11,588
RALPH: You ready to take this?
PIRATE: Alright, I got it. Ah.


725
0:38:11,588 --> 0:38:18,195
Now, it's got a good
little head shake going on.


726
0:38:18,195 --> 0:38:20,697
RALPH: Let's see him.


727
0:38:20,697 --> 0:38:36,713
PIRATE: Gonna be
close, really close.


728
0:38:36,713 --> 0:38:38,949
I'm saying to myself, there's no
way I'm letting this one get


729
0:38:38,949 --> 0:38:41,284
away, we need this one.


730
0:38:41,284 --> 0:38:44,221
You could see the color already.
Get the gaf, get the gaf.


731
0:38:44,221 --> 0:38:46,69
Might be a keeper.


732
0:38:46,69 --> 0:38:49,92
RALPH: Get the gaff, get the
gaff. Might be a keeper.


733
0:38:49,92 --> 0:38:50,794
PIRATE: Aw, BLEEP the
thing snapped on me.


734
0:38:50,794 --> 0:38:53,797
BLEEP Where is he?
Right here.


735
0:38:53,797 --> 0:38:57,0
RALPH: Don't lose it. Hold it.
Hold it. Get the head.


736
0:38:57,0 --> 0:39:2,873
PIRATE: Alright.
RALPH: Get the tail rope.


737
0:39:2,873 --> 0:39:5,942
PIRATE: I got it. Easy cap.


738
0:39:5,942 --> 0:39:13,283
RALPH: That's it, he's ours.
Go tie that line there.


739
0:39:13,283 --> 0:39:25,128
PIRATE: Oh, here we go,
I got it right here.


740
0:39:25,128 --> 0:39:31,201
By the gills. All right.


741
0:39:31,201 --> 0:39:35,238
RALPH: 76. Alright, that's a
high five now. Thank you, sir.


742
0:39:35,238 --> 0:39:40,43
PIRATE: It's not the
biggest fish we've gotten,


743
0:39:40,43 --> 0:39:42,546
but the streak's broken now so
hopefully we start getting back


744
0:39:42,546 --> 0:39:44,214
on another good roll.


745
0:39:44,214 --> 0:39:45,849
RALPH: It's some fuel
money, that's for sure.


746
0:39:45,849 --> 0:39:48,285
It just goes to show you if you
make the sacrifice and you get


747
0:39:48,285 --> 0:39:49,453
out on those rough days.


748
0:39:49,453 --> 0:39:50,654
It could pay off.
Alright. I'll start...


749
0:39:50,654 --> 0:39:51,721
PIRATE: It's a dark back.


750
0:39:51,721 --> 0:39:54,357
RALPH: I'll chum, you
take care of the fish.


751
0:39:54,357 --> 0:40:3,767
PIRATE: I got ya.


752
0:40:3,767 --> 0:40:8,138
PAUL: Okay, Sandro. Little
more, keep going.


753
0:40:8,138 --> 0:40:17,18
That's good, we got it.


754
0:40:17,18 --> 0:40:20,684
PAUL: Here and here, see
I rinsed all the oil off.


755
0:40:20,684 --> 0:40:24,688
DAVE CARRARO:
There's no oil in it.


756
0:40:24,688 --> 0:40:26,69
PAUL: A little bit. A new
cut, you'd see different,


757
0:40:26,69 --> 0:40:28,325
you know what I mean?


758
0:40:28,325 --> 0:40:30,861
DAVE CARRARO: Yeah. That's the
tail cut. It's not a great fish.


759
0:40:30,861 --> 0:40:34,664
Little bit of fat in the minors,
the majors, there's not much.


760
0:40:34,664 --> 0:40:37,167
It's a good size fish for one
restaurant, they look for that,


761
0:40:37,167 --> 0:40:40,237
I'll give it like
a c plus, at best.


762
0:40:40,237 --> 0:40:42,5
It was definitely a ride
from hell coming home.


763
0:40:42,5 --> 0:40:44,641
I mean, we had 40-knot
winds, it is what it is, uh,


764
0:40:44,641 --> 0:40:46,409
I could hope for a better
trip next time. That's all.


765
0:40:46,409 --> 0:40:48,745
We made money, happy
with that, but, uh,


766
0:40:48,745 --> 0:40:50,847
I'll be a lot happier
with, ah, three next time.


767
0:40:50,847 --> 0:40:56,52
So we'll see, it's alright.
Take it.


768
0:40:56,52 --> 0:40:58,121
Bring him in, ready?
Say goodbye.


769
0:40:58,121 --> 0:41:0,624
MAN: Woo.
DAVE CARRARO: Say goodbye.


770
0:41:0,624 --> 0:41:3,894
PAUL: The majority
didn't have...


771
0:41:3,894 --> 0:41:6,696
We just unloaded a
nice 300 pounder,


772
0:41:6,696 --> 0:41:8,765
we need to get right the
BLEEP back out tomorrow.


773
0:41:8,765 --> 0:41:11,268
Cause they're biting right
now, while it's rough,


774
0:41:11,268 --> 0:41:12,969
they frenzy out.


775
0:41:12,969 --> 0:41:18,975
Really fortunate and
lucky, we got one.


776
0:41:18,975 --> 0:41:20,577
PAUL: Some people would say
we're out of your BLEEP minds,


777
0:41:20,577 --> 0:41:23,38
but why do we do this?


778
0:41:23,38 --> 0:41:26,55
You're a BLEEP addict.
You 're a tuna addict.


779
0:41:26,55 --> 0:41:31,855
We caught a lot
of fish this year.


780
0:41:31,855 --> 0:41:46,67
This weather separates the men
from the boys. That's for sure.


781
0:41:46,67 --> 0:41:47,637
MARCIANO: What do you want to
drink? You want something?


782
0:41:47,637 --> 0:41:50,273
JOE: Apple juice.


783
0:41:50,273 --> 0:41:51,641
MARCIANO: You know, even
with the bad weather,


784
0:41:51,641 --> 0:41:53,677
we wound up having
a pretty good week.


785
0:41:53,677 --> 0:41:56,813
We had one nice fish that
brought us, you know,


786
0:41:56,813 --> 0:41:59,349
a little over 8,000 dollars.


787
0:41:59,349 --> 0:42:1,851
So we're gonna head right
back out there tomorrow cause


788
0:42:1,851 --> 0:42:3,186
that's what I do.


789
0:42:3,186 --> 0:42:5,922
But at least for now, it's nice
to spend a little time


790
0:42:5,922 --> 0:42:7,19
with my son.


791
0:42:7,19 --> 0:42:10,66
That was probably a 850 pounder.
It's pretty close to that.


792
0:42:10,66 --> 0:42:12,929
You know, I'm real lucky that
he's really good quality.


793
0:42:12,929 --> 0:42:15,265
He's got a lot of grease
in him, lot of grease.


794
0:42:15,265 --> 0:42:16,166
JOE: Yeah.


795
0:42:16,166 --> 0:42:17,701
MARCIANO: But that's
our score there.


796
0:42:17,701 --> 0:42:19,269
JOE: How long did it
take to fight him on you?


797
0:42:19,269 --> 0:42:21,404
JAY: Maybe an hour.
MARCIANO: Yeah, an hour.


798
0:42:21,404 --> 0:42:23,6
JAY: Well, at least we
didn't come back with zero.


799
0:42:23,6 --> 0:42:24,207
MARCIANO: That's right.


800
0:42:24,207 --> 0:42:27,744
Obviously, family is priority,
but at the same point,


801
0:42:27,744 --> 0:42:32,48
fishing is important too,
because ultimately that's what


802
0:42:32,48 --> 0:42:33,416
supports the family.


803
0:42:33,416 --> 0:42:35,151
JAY: I just wish we had
a shower on the boat.


804
0:42:35,151 --> 0:42:46,463
MARCIANO: Yeah, keep dreaming.
Shower.


805
0:42:46,463 --> 0:42:49,966
RALPH: Nice day. It's
a lousy day weather wise,


806
0:42:49,966 --> 0:42:52,68
but we managed to
get a bite today.


807
0:42:52,68 --> 0:42:55,905
PIRATE: Oh my God, you
don't have to go out there,


808
0:42:55,905 --> 0:42:57,44
don't be out there.


809
0:42:57,44 --> 0:43:0,76
If you brave the elements long
enough and you fish hard enough,


810
0:43:0,76 --> 0:43:4,214
it pays off at the end. Oh.


811
0:43:4,214 --> 0:43:5,849
RALPH: Typically the fish
like the nasty weather,


812
0:43:5,849 --> 0:43:8,852
so we like to go when it's
raining and blowing and


813
0:43:8,852 --> 0:43:10,92
rough and, you know, it's
usually a little fishier,


814
0:43:10,92 --> 0:43:12,489
and there's less boats,
less competition.


815
0:43:12,489 --> 0:43:14,924
That's right, little
fish, big checks.


816
0:43:14,924 --> 0:43:17,594
MAN: Alright, let's
see what we got.


817
0:43:17,594 --> 0:43:19,562
Pirate, you switched
it to kilograms.


818
0:43:19,562 --> 0:43:22,265
PIRATE: I didn't touch nothing.
The, it was flopping around.


819
0:43:22,265 --> 0:43:25,135
MAN: Two twelve point
five, that's a nice one.


820
0:43:25,135 --> 0:43:27,57
PIRATE: Wow, that's pretty good.
MAN: Nice job, Ralphie.


821
0:43:27,57 --> 0:43:30,73
RALPH: Just bring me
the big check, man.


822
0:43:30,73 --> 0:43:33,343
Little fish, big checks.


823
0:43:33,343 --> 0:43:34,511
PIRATE: Boy, that thing had a
little bit more meat on it than


824
0:43:34,511 --> 0:43:35,845
I thought.


825
0:43:35,845 --> 0:43:37,414
I'd rather catch a two hundred
pounder at 20 bucks than catch a


826
0:43:37,414 --> 0:43:39,916
400 pounder at ten bucks.


827
0:43:39,916 --> 0:43:41,551
Hey, I'll take it, it's a check.


828
0:43:41,551 --> 0:43:44,22
but Pirate, go ahead, tell them
what went on out there today.


829
0:43:44,22 --> 0:43:45,622
PIRATE: I'm sitting
here like this,


830
0:43:45,622 --> 0:43:47,757
he come down through out of the
wheel house to do something and


831
0:43:47,757 --> 0:43:50,827
all of the sudden, he yells,
fish on! I was like wow.


832
0:43:50,827 --> 0:43:52,696
And I'm looking like this,
I didn't know what to do,


833
0:43:52,696 --> 0:43:54,264
so I had to run up
to the bow like this.


834
0:43:54,264 --> 0:43:55,598
Climb up over there.


835
0:43:55,598 --> 0:43:58,168
Then you gotta jump
back on the deck,


836
0:43:58,168 --> 0:44:0,27
come down the other
pole like this.


837
0:44:0,27 --> 0:44:1,871
And then finally we
got back over here,


838
0:44:1,871 --> 0:44:4,808
the captain gave me the pole,
got it out like this and


839
0:44:4,808 --> 0:44:6,9
we started.


840
0:44:6,9 --> 0:44:8,44
A few minutes later, we
started seeing the line and


841
0:44:8,44 --> 0:44:9,813
the color and then
that was the end of that.


842
0:44:9,813 --> 0:44:11,414
RALPH: You ready? Let's go.


843
0:44:11,414 --> 0:44:13,383
PIRATE: Yep. Captain says
it's time to get these wet


844
0:44:13,383 --> 0:44:15,752
clothes off, head back to the
house, grab a nice hot shower


845
0:44:15,752 --> 0:44:17,887
and a meal and go make some
z's, call up my honey bee,


846
0:44:17,887 --> 0:44:19,889
see where she's at right now.


847
0:44:19,889 --> 0:44:21,124
Give her the good news.


848
0:44:21,124 --> 0:44:23,493
RALPH: We got paid for today and
hopefully we can continue


849
0:44:23,493 --> 0:44:25,361
the roll and, and catch
a couple more before


850
0:44:25,361 --> 0:44:26,963
the end of the fall blitz.


851
0:44:26,963 --> 0:44:28,998
PIRATE: Charging my batteries
up, so I can come back out here


852
0:44:28,998 --> 0:46:28,998
and do it all over again.
