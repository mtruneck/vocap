1
0:0:24,326 --> 0:0:28,83
Two households,
both alike in dignity,


2
0:0:28,83 --> 0:0:35,336
in fair Verona
where we lay our scene,


3
0:0:35,336 --> 0:0:40,34
from ancient grudge
break to new mutiny,


4
0:0:40,34 --> 0:0:45,845
where civil blood
makes civil hands unclean.


5
0:0:45,845 --> 0:0:51,85
From forth the fatal loins
of these two foes...


6
0:0:51,85 --> 0:0:57,856
a pair of star-crossed lovers
take their life,


7
0:0:57,856 --> 0:1:3,294
whose misadventured
piteous overthrows


8
0:1:3,294 --> 0:1:29,317
do with their death...
bury their parents'strife.


9
0:1:29,317 --> 0:1:32,319
But the quarrel is between
our masters and us their men.


10
0:1:32,319 --> 0:1:36,323
Ah, 'tis all one.


11
0:1:36,323 --> 0:1:42,328
Here come the house
of the Montagues.


12
0:1:42,328 --> 0:1:43,829
Ah, good morrow.


13
0:1:43,829 --> 0:1:45,697
Good morrow
to you, sir.


14
0:1:45,697 --> 0:1:48,833
Quarrel,
I will back thee.


15
0:1:48,833 --> 0:1:50,335
Right.


16
0:1:50,335 --> 0:2:1,944
Fail me not.


17
0:2:1,944 --> 0:2:5,281
Do you bite
your thumb at us, sir?


18
0:2:5,281 --> 0:2:8,283
I do bite
my thumb, sir.


19
0:2:8,283 --> 0:2:13,288
Do you bite
your thumb at us, sir?


20
0:2:13,288 --> 0:2:15,79
No, sir.


21
0:2:15,79 --> 0:2:18,793
I do not bite my
thumb at you, sir,


22
0:2:18,793 --> 0:2:21,295
but I do bite
my thumb, sir.


23
0:2:21,295 --> 0:2:22,797
Do you quarrel, sir?


24
0:2:22,797 --> 0:2:28,301
Quarrel, sir?
No, no, no, sir.


25
0:2:28,301 --> 0:2:30,803
If you do, sir,
I am for you.


26
0:2:30,803 --> 0:2:32,805
I serve as good
a man as you.


27
0:2:32,805 --> 0:2:33,806
No better?


28
0:2:33,806 --> 0:2:39,31
Yes, better, sir.


29
0:2:39,31 --> 0:2:54,757
You lie.


30
0:2:54,757 --> 0:2:56,325
Draw!


31
0:2:56,325 --> 0:2:58,27
Draw if you be men!


32
0:2:58,27 --> 0:3:4,265
Gregory, remember
thy swashing blow!


33
0:3:4,265 --> 0:3:21,781
Kill the Capulets!


34
0:3:21,781 --> 0:3:24,283
Part, fools!
Put up your swords!


35
0:3:24,283 --> 0:3:26,284
You know not what you do!


36
0:3:26,284 --> 0:3:28,286
The Prince hath
expressly forbid


37
0:3:28,286 --> 0:3:30,388
this bandying
in Verona streets!


38
0:3:30,388 --> 0:3:34,291
Here come the Capulets!


39
0:3:34,291 --> 0:3:44,801
Tybalt, Capulet's kinsman!


40
0:3:44,801 --> 0:3:52,808
What, art thou drawn among
these heartless hinds?


41
0:3:52,808 --> 0:3:55,81
Turn thee, Benvolio.
Look upon thy death.


42
0:3:55,81 --> 0:3:57,311
I do but keep the peace.


43
0:3:57,311 --> 0:3:58,813
Put up thy sword


44
0:3:58,813 --> 0:4:1,249
or manage it
to part these men with me.


45
0:4:1,249 --> 0:4:4,5
What, drawn
and talk of peace?


46
0:4:4,5 --> 0:4:5,552
I hate the word,


47
0:4:5,552 --> 0:4:10,23
as I hate hell,
all Montagues and thee.


48
0:4:10,23 --> 0:4:11,59
Have at thee, cowards!


49
0:4:11,59 --> 0:4:13,392
Capulet!


50
0:4:13,392 --> 0:4:17,96
Montague!


51
0:4:17,96 --> 0:4:28,71
Capulet!


52
0:4:28,71 --> 0:4:30,4
Now hie thee home,
fragment.


53
0:4:30,4 --> 0:4:36,112
You villain!


54
0:4:36,112 --> 0:4:43,51
Capulet!


55
0:4:43,51 --> 0:4:46,388
Give me my long sword! Ho!


56
0:4:46,388 --> 0:4:47,789
Capulet!


57
0:4:47,789 --> 0:4:49,29
Down to the market square!


58
0:4:49,29 --> 0:4:51,292
Capulet!


59
0:4:51,292 --> 0:4:54,61
Follow me! Follow me!


60
0:4:54,61 --> 0:5:0,266
Kill that villain Montague!


61
0:5:0,266 --> 0:5:3,236
My noble uncle!
My noble uncle!


62
0:5:3,236 --> 0:5:5,37
What?


63
0:5:5,37 --> 0:5:8,24
My sword! My sword!


64
0:5:8,24 --> 0:5:12,243
Thou shalt not stir
a foot to seek a foe!


65
0:5:12,243 --> 0:5:16,147
Hold me not!
Let me go!


66
0:5:16,147 --> 0:5:18,249
Montague!


67
0:5:18,249 --> 0:5:19,749
Montague!


68
0:5:19,749 --> 0:5:46,39
Kill the villain!


69
0:5:46,39 --> 0:6:4,222
I'll strike thee, coward.


70
0:6:4,222 --> 0:6:5,923
The Prince!


71
0:6:5,923 --> 0:6:8,192
The Prince is coming!
Put down your weapons!


72
0:6:8,192 --> 0:6:10,494
The Prince!


73
0:6:10,494 --> 0:6:15,98
The Prince!


74
0:6:15,98 --> 0:6:17,367
Here comes the Prince!


75
0:6:17,367 --> 0:6:26,742
Put your weapons down!
The Prince!


76
0:6:26,742 --> 0:6:30,678
Rebellious subjects,
enemies to peace,


77
0:6:30,678 --> 0:6:33,247
throw your mistempered
weapons to the ground...


78
0:6:33,247 --> 0:6:36,516
Down with your weapons.


79
0:6:36,516 --> 0:6:44,757
And hear the sentence
of your moved Prince.


80
0:6:44,757 --> 0:6:49,261
Three civil brawls
bred of an airy word,


81
0:6:49,261 --> 0:6:50,829
by thee, old Capulet...


82
0:6:50,829 --> 0:6:56,0
No, no.


83
0:6:56,0 --> 0:6:58,403
And Montague...


84
0:6:58,403 --> 0:7:4,708
Have thrice disturbed
the quiet of our streets.


85
0:7:4,708 --> 0:7:8,21
If ever you disturb
our streets again,


86
0:7:8,21 --> 0:7:12,214
your lives shall pay
the forfeit of the peace.


87
0:7:12,214 --> 0:7:20,221
For this time
all the rest depart away!


88
0:7:20,221 --> 0:7:23,824
You, Capulet,
shall go along with me.


89
0:7:23,824 --> 0:7:29,229
And, Montague,
come you this afternoon.


90
0:7:29,229 --> 0:7:53,249
Once more, on pain of death,
all men depart.


91
0:7:53,249 --> 0:7:56,252
Where is Romeo?
Saw you him today?


92
0:7:56,252 --> 0:7:59,756
Right glad I am
he was not at this fray.


93
0:7:59,756 --> 0:8:2,191
Madam, an hour before
the worshipped sun


94
0:8:2,191 --> 0:8:4,76
peered forth
the golden window of the east,


95
0:8:4,76 --> 0:8:8,196
a troubled mind drove me
to walk abroad:


96
0:8:8,196 --> 0:8:10,698
where, underneath
the grove of sycamore


97
0:8:10,698 --> 0:8:12,867
so early walking
did I see your son.


98
0:8:12,867 --> 0:8:17,704
Towards him I made;
but he was ware of me,


99
0:8:17,704 --> 0:8:23,709
and stole into
the cover of the wood.


100
0:8:23,709 --> 0:8:32,55
Many a morning hath
he there been seen.


101
0:8:32,55 --> 0:8:42,392
See, where he comes.


102
0:8:42,392 --> 0:8:44,728
So please you, step aside.


103
0:8:44,728 --> 0:8:48,231
I'll know his grievance,
or be much denied.


104
0:8:48,231 --> 0:8:51,234
I would thou wert
so happy by thy stay,


105
0:8:51,234 --> 0:8:52,735
to hear true shrift.


106
0:8:52,735 --> 0:9:26,797
Come, madam. Let's away.


107
0:9:26,797 --> 0:9:34,204
Good morrow, cousin.


108
0:9:34,204 --> 0:9:36,39
Is the day so young?


109
0:9:36,39 --> 0:9:37,841
But new struck nine.


110
0:9:37,841 --> 0:9:41,21
Ay me!


111
0:9:41,21 --> 0:9:48,716
Sad hours seem long.


112
0:9:48,716 --> 0:9:52,72
Was that my father
that went hence so fast?


113
0:9:52,72 --> 0:10:1,562
It was.


114
0:10:1,562 --> 0:10:4,363
What sadness lengthens
Romeo's hours?


115
0:10:4,363 --> 0:10:14,539
Not having that, which having
makes them short.


116
0:10:14,539 --> 0:10:16,241
But, Romeo...


117
0:10:16,241 --> 0:10:29,752
Farewell, Coz.


118
0:10:29,752 --> 0:10:31,754
God's me,
what fray was here?


119
0:10:31,754 --> 0:10:33,255
Yet tell me not,


120
0:10:33,255 --> 0:10:37,759
for I have heard it all.


121
0:10:37,759 --> 0:10:43,764
Here's much to do with hate,
but more with love.


122
0:10:43,764 --> 0:10:52,672
Soft, I will go along.


123
0:10:52,672 --> 0:10:56,275
But Montague is bound
as well as l,


124
0:10:56,275 --> 0:10:59,278
in penalty alike,


125
0:10:59,278 --> 0:11:1,213
and 'tis not hard, I think,


126
0:11:1,213 --> 0:11:4,716
for men as old as we
to keep the peace.


127
0:11:4,716 --> 0:11:5,717
Oh...


128
0:11:5,717 --> 0:11:8,219
Of honorable reckoning
are you both,


129
0:11:8,219 --> 0:11:11,722
and pity 'tis you
lived at odds so long:


130
0:11:11,722 --> 0:11:15,726
but, but now, my lord,


131
0:11:15,726 --> 0:11:17,761
what say you to my suit?


132
0:11:17,761 --> 0:11:20,73
But saying o'er what
I have said before,


133
0:11:20,73 --> 0:11:24,934
my child is yet
a stranger in the world.


134
0:11:24,934 --> 0:11:34,75
She hath not seen the change
of fourteen years.


135
0:11:34,75 --> 0:11:37,244
Let two more summers
wither in their pride,


136
0:11:37,244 --> 0:11:39,179
'ere we may think her
ripe to be a bride.


137
0:11:39,179 --> 0:11:49,988
Younger than she
are happy mothers made.


138
0:11:49,988 --> 0:11:53,759
And too soon marred
are those so early made.


139
0:11:53,759 --> 0:11:56,762
The earth hath swallowed
all my hopes but she,


140
0:11:56,762 --> 0:11:59,764
she is the hopeful lady
of my earth.


141
0:11:59,764 --> 0:12:3,2
But woo her, gentle
Paris, get her heart,


142
0:12:3,2 --> 0:12:6,703
my will to her consent
is but a part.


143
0:12:6,703 --> 0:12:9,205
Oh, Peter!


144
0:12:9,205 --> 0:12:12,709
This night I hold
an old accustomed feast


145
0:12:12,709 --> 0:12:15,21
whereto I have invited
many a guest.


146
0:12:15,21 --> 0:12:18,213
Such as I love,
you among the store,


147
0:12:18,213 --> 0:12:29,222
one more, most welcome,
makes my number more.


148
0:12:29,222 --> 0:12:31,24
Nurse,
where's my daughter?


149
0:12:31,24 --> 0:12:33,226
Call her forth to me.


150
0:12:33,226 --> 0:12:35,228
Now, by my maidenhead
at 12 years old,


151
0:12:35,228 --> 0:12:36,796
I bade her come.


152
0:12:36,796 --> 0:12:40,199
Where is the girl?
Juliet! Juliet!


153
0:12:40,199 --> 0:12:44,436
Where is the girl?
Juliet!


154
0:12:44,436 --> 0:12:48,74
Where is the girl? Juliet!


155
0:12:48,74 --> 0:12:51,241
How now, who calls?


156
0:12:51,241 --> 0:13:5,188
Your mother!
Your lady mother!


157
0:13:5,188 --> 0:13:8,19
Juliet, it's your mother,
your lady mother.


158
0:13:8,19 --> 0:13:10,192
Make haste, girl.
Make haste.


159
0:13:10,192 --> 0:13:14,195
Where were you?


160
0:13:14,195 --> 0:13:18,199
Madam, I am here.
What is your will?


161
0:13:18,199 --> 0:13:22,702
This is the matter.


162
0:13:22,702 --> 0:13:25,205
Make haste, girls.
Come on, come on.


163
0:13:25,205 --> 0:13:26,306
Nurse, um...


164
0:13:26,306 --> 0:13:36,715
give leave awhile,
we must talk in secret.


165
0:13:36,715 --> 0:13:39,717
Nurse, come back again.
I have remembered me.


166
0:13:39,717 --> 0:13:43,221
Thou's hear our counsel.


167
0:13:43,221 --> 0:13:45,222
Thou knowest my daughter's
of a pretty age.


168
0:13:45,222 --> 0:13:47,224
I can tell her age
unto an hour.


169
0:13:47,224 --> 0:13:48,715
She's not fourteen.


170
0:13:48,715 --> 0:13:50,617
I'll lay fourteen
of my teeth.


171
0:13:50,617 --> 0:13:52,618
And yet to
my teen be it spoke,


172
0:13:52,618 --> 0:13:54,62
I have but four,
she's not fourteen.


173
0:13:54,62 --> 0:13:56,322
How long is it
to Lammastide?


174
0:13:56,322 --> 0:13:58,123
A fortnight and odd days.


175
0:13:58,123 --> 0:14:0,558
Even or odd, of all
the days of the year,


176
0:14:0,558 --> 0:14:2,56
come Lammas Eve at night
shall she be fourteen.


177
0:14:2,56 --> 0:14:4,62
Susan and she--


178
0:14:4,62 --> 0:14:6,564
God rest all Christian
souls were of an age.


179
0:14:6,564 --> 0:14:9,66
Well, Susan is with God.
She was too good for me.


180
0:14:9,66 --> 0:14:10,934
But, as I said,
on Lammas Eve


181
0:14:10,934 --> 0:14:13,103
at night
shall she be fourteen.


182
0:14:13,103 --> 0:14:15,372
That shall she, marry!
I remember it well.


183
0:14:15,372 --> 0:14:19,75
My lord and you
were then at Mantua!


184
0:14:19,75 --> 0:14:21,577
Nay, I do bear a brain.


185
0:14:21,577 --> 0:14:24,79
For then she could,
she could stand high lone.


186
0:14:24,79 --> 0:14:27,82
Nay, by the road she could have
run and waddled all about,


187
0:14:27,82 --> 0:14:30,85
for even the day before
she broke her brow;


188
0:14:30,85 --> 0:14:34,54
and then my husband-- God rest his soul,
'a were a merry man--


189
0:14:34,54 --> 0:14:35,556
took up the child.


190
0:14:35,556 --> 0:14:39,92
"Yea," quoth he,
"dost thou fall upon thy face?


191
0:14:39,92 --> 0:14:42,28
"Thou wilt fall backward
when thou hast more wit;


192
0:14:42,28 --> 0:14:43,96
wilt thou not, Jule?"


193
0:14:43,96 --> 0:14:45,98
Nurse!


194
0:14:45,98 --> 0:14:46,598
And by my holiday,


195
0:14:46,598 --> 0:14:53,105
the pretty wretch left
crying and said, "Ay."


196
0:14:53,105 --> 0:14:56,107
Enough of this,
I pray thee hold thy peace.


197
0:14:56,107 --> 0:14:58,709
Yes, madam.


198
0:14:58,709 --> 0:15:4,47
Now, Juliet.


199
0:15:4,47 --> 0:15:6,549
God mark thee to His grace


200
0:15:6,549 --> 0:15:9,985
Thou was the prettiest babe
that 'er I nurs'd.


201
0:15:9,985 --> 0:15:12,54
And I might live to see
thee married once,


202
0:15:12,54 --> 0:15:13,989
I have my wish.


203
0:15:13,989 --> 0:15:20,561
Marry, that "marry" is the very theme
I came to talk of.


204
0:15:20,561 --> 0:15:21,829
Tell me,
daughter Juliet,


205
0:15:21,829 --> 0:15:32,571
how stands your disposition
to be married?


206
0:15:32,571 --> 0:15:35,74
It is an honor
that I dream not of.


207
0:15:35,74 --> 0:15:37,576
An honor, were I not
thy only nurse,


208
0:15:37,576 --> 0:15:40,545
I would say thou hadst sucked
wisdom from my teat.


209
0:15:40,545 --> 0:15:43,81
Well, think
of marriage now.


210
0:15:43,81 --> 0:15:46,84
Younger than you, here in Verona,
ladies of esteem,


211
0:15:46,84 --> 0:15:47,584
are made
already mothers.


212
0:15:47,584 --> 0:15:50,87
By my count
I was your mother


213
0:15:50,87 --> 0:15:53,9
much upon these years
that you are now a maid.


214
0:15:53,9 --> 0:15:54,591
Oh, yes, I remember.


215
0:15:54,591 --> 0:15:57,427
Thus then, in brief...


216
0:15:57,427 --> 0:16:0,363
the valiant Paris
seeks you for his love.


217
0:16:0,363 --> 0:16:5,534
A man, young lady!
Lady, such as all the world--


218
0:16:5,534 --> 0:16:7,536
Why he's a man of wax.


219
0:16:7,536 --> 0:16:9,538
Verona's summer hath
not such a flower.


220
0:16:9,538 --> 0:16:11,539
Nay, he's
a flower in faith.


221
0:16:11,539 --> 0:16:13,4
Shh.


222
0:16:13,4 --> 0:16:19,546
What say you?
Can you love the gentleman?


223
0:16:19,546 --> 0:16:21,381
Madam! Madam!


224
0:16:21,381 --> 0:16:23,55
The guests have come,
supper serv'd up,


225
0:16:23,55 --> 0:16:25,751
you call'd,
my young lady ask'd for!


226
0:16:25,751 --> 0:16:28,53
We follow.


227
0:16:28,53 --> 0:16:32,57
Speak briefly,
can you like of Paris' love?


228
0:16:32,57 --> 0:16:37,562
I'll look to like,
if looking liking move.


229
0:16:37,562 --> 0:16:41,64
But no more deep
will I endart mine eye,


230
0:16:41,64 --> 0:16:47,571
than your consent gives
strength to make it fly.


231
0:16:47,571 --> 0:16:50,573
Juliet, the county stays.


232
0:16:50,573 --> 0:16:53,576
Madam, I come.


233
0:16:53,576 --> 0:17:20,765
Go, girl, seek happy nights
for happy days.


234
0:17:20,765 --> 0:17:24,269
Give me a case
to put my visage in;


235
0:17:24,269 --> 0:17:26,304
a visor for a visor.


236
0:17:26,304 --> 0:17:31,41
What care I what curious eye
doth quote deformities.


237
0:17:31,41 --> 0:17:38,381
Here are the beetle-brows
shall blush for me.


238
0:17:38,381 --> 0:17:40,55
What, shall this speech
be spoke for our excuse?


239
0:17:40,55 --> 0:17:42,551
Or shall we on
without apology?


240
0:17:42,551 --> 0:17:44,386
The date is out
of such prolixity.


241
0:17:44,386 --> 0:17:46,321
Let them measure us
by what they will.


242
0:17:46,321 --> 0:17:48,557
We'll measure them
a measure and be gone.


243
0:17:48,557 --> 0:17:51,559
Come, knock and enter,
and no sooner in,


244
0:17:51,559 --> 0:17:55,429
but every man
betake him to his legs.


245
0:17:55,429 --> 0:17:58,64
And we mean well in
going to this masque,


246
0:17:58,64 --> 0:17:59,533
but 'tis no wit to go.


247
0:17:59,533 --> 0:18:1,301
Why, may one ask?


248
0:18:1,301 --> 0:18:5,471
I dreamt a dream tonight.


249
0:18:5,471 --> 0:18:7,306
Ho, and so did I.


250
0:18:7,306 --> 0:18:10,876
Well, what was yours?


251
0:18:10,876 --> 0:18:14,279
That dreamers often lie.


252
0:18:14,279 --> 0:18:18,95
In bed asleep while they
do dream things true.


253
0:18:18,95 --> 0:18:22,586
Oh, then I see Queen Mab
hath been with you.


254
0:18:22,586 --> 0:18:25,322
Queen Mab?


255
0:18:25,322 --> 0:18:32,528
She is...She is
the fairies' midwife.


256
0:18:32,528 --> 0:18:33,963
And she comes in state


257
0:18:33,963 --> 0:18:36,464
no bigger than
an agate stone


258
0:18:36,464 --> 0:18:38,533
on the forefinger
of an alderman,


259
0:18:38,533 --> 0:18:41,836
drawn with a team
of little atomies


260
0:18:41,836 --> 0:18:45,72
athwart men's noses
as they lie asleep.


261
0:18:45,72 --> 0:18:50,44
Her wagon spokes are made
of long spinner's legs;


262
0:18:50,44 --> 0:18:53,546
and the cover,
of the wings of grasshoppers;


263
0:18:53,546 --> 0:18:58,51
the traces
of the smallest spider's web;


264
0:18:58,51 --> 0:19:3,989
and the collars, mmm,
of the moonshine's watery beams;


265
0:19:3,989 --> 0:19:6,524
her whip, crack!


266
0:19:6,524 --> 0:19:10,595
Is a cricket's bone;
the lash of film;


267
0:19:10,595 --> 0:19:12,964
and in this state


268
0:19:12,964 --> 0:19:15,699
she gallops night by night
through lovers' brains,


269
0:19:15,699 --> 0:19:19,202
and then they dream of love,


270
0:19:19,202 --> 0:19:23,706
o'er ladies' lips,
who straight on kisses dream,


271
0:19:23,706 --> 0:19:29,211
which oft the angry Mab
with blisters plagues,


272
0:19:29,211 --> 0:19:32,213
because their breaths
with, er,


273
0:19:32,213 --> 0:19:33,715
sweetmeats tainted are.


274
0:19:33,715 --> 0:19:37,217
Snd sometime comes she
with a tithe-pig's tail,


275
0:19:37,217 --> 0:19:40,22
tickling the parson's nose
as he lies asleep,


276
0:19:40,22 --> 0:19:45,358
and dreams he
of another benefice.


277
0:19:45,358 --> 0:19:50,763
Amen.


278
0:19:50,763 --> 0:19:53,598
Sometimes she driveth
o'er a soldier's neck,


279
0:19:53,598 --> 0:19:55,1
and then dreams he


280
0:19:55,1 --> 0:19:58,536
of cutting foreign throats,
of breaches,


281
0:19:58,536 --> 0:20:1,739
ambuscadoes, spanish blades,
drums in his ear,


282
0:20:1,739 --> 0:20:3,24
at which he starts and wakes;


283
0:20:3,24 --> 0:20:11,748
and being thus frighted
tries a prayer or two...


284
0:20:11,748 --> 0:20:14,25
and sleeps again.


285
0:20:14,25 --> 0:20:16,251
This is that very Mab


286
0:20:16,251 --> 0:20:19,254
that plaits the manes
of horses in the night,


287
0:20:19,254 --> 0:20:23,257
and bakes the elf-locks
in foul sluttish hairs,


288
0:20:23,257 --> 0:20:26,894
which once untangled
much misfortune bodes.


289
0:20:26,894 --> 0:20:31,264
This is the hag,
when maids lie on their backs,


290
0:20:31,264 --> 0:20:34,768
that presses them
and learns them first to bear


291
0:20:34,768 --> 0:20:39,271
making them women
of good carriage.


292
0:20:39,271 --> 0:20:41,73
This is she...


293
0:20:41,73 --> 0:20:44,276
This is she that...


294
0:20:44,276 --> 0:20:55,285
This...is she.


295
0:20:55,285 --> 0:20:57,788
Peace, Mercutio, peace.


296
0:20:57,788 --> 0:21:0,223
Thou talk'st of nothing.


297
0:21:0,223 --> 0:21:7,229
Thou talk'st of nothing.


298
0:21:7,229 --> 0:21:8,931
True.


299
0:21:8,931 --> 0:21:13,234
True, I talk of dreams;


300
0:21:13,234 --> 0:21:18,739
which are the children
of an idle brain...


301
0:21:18,739 --> 0:21:23,243
Begot of nothing
but vain fantasy;


302
0:21:23,243 --> 0:21:27,747
which is as thin
of substance as the air,


303
0:21:27,747 --> 0:21:30,75
and more inconstant
than the wind


304
0:21:30,75 --> 0:21:34,252
who woos even now
the frozen bosom of the north,


305
0:21:34,252 --> 0:21:38,256
and being angered
puffs away from thence,


306
0:21:38,256 --> 0:21:45,563
turning his side
to the dew-dropping south.


307
0:21:45,563 --> 0:21:49,766
This wind you talk of
blows us from ourselves.


308
0:21:49,766 --> 0:21:59,775
Strike drum.
Come, lusty gentlemen.


309
0:21:59,775 --> 0:22:4,145
Romeo, we shall
arrive too late.


310
0:22:4,145 --> 0:22:8,216
I fear too early...


311
0:22:8,216 --> 0:22:10,717
For my mind misgives...


312
0:22:10,717 --> 0:22:14,221
Some consequence,
yet hanging in the stars,


313
0:22:14,221 --> 0:22:19,225
shall bitterly begin
his fearful date


314
0:22:19,225 --> 0:22:21,727
with this night's revels,


315
0:22:21,727 --> 0:22:24,73
and expire the term
of a despised life


316
0:22:24,73 --> 0:22:27,732
closed in my breast,


317
0:22:27,732 --> 0:22:37,741
by some vile forfeit
of untimely death.


318
0:22:37,741 --> 0:22:43,246
But he that hath
the steerage of my course...


319
0:22:43,246 --> 0:22:50,118
Direct my sail.


320
0:22:50,118 --> 0:22:54,256
Enter my poor house.
Vido, vido, welcome.


321
0:22:54,256 --> 0:22:59,26
Oh, my lovely Helena,
my lovely niece.


322
0:22:59,26 --> 0:23:2,196
Welcome all!
Be merry, gentlemen.


323
0:23:2,196 --> 0:23:5,198
Be lively, ladies.
Ahoy! Ahoy!


324
0:23:5,198 --> 0:23:6,699
Welcome, gentlemen.


325
0:23:6,699 --> 0:23:9,202
I have seen the day
that I have worn a visor


326
0:23:9,202 --> 0:23:11,703
and could tell a whispering tale
in a fair lady's ear,


327
0:23:11,703 --> 0:23:13,205
such as would please.


328
0:23:13,205 --> 0:23:16,208
'Tis gone, 'tis gone.
You are welcome, gentlemen.


329
0:23:16,208 --> 0:25:59,16
Ladies, ho, ho!


330
0:25:59,16 --> 0:26:5,155
She doth teach the torches
to burn bright.


331
0:26:5,155 --> 0:26:7,89
It seems she hangs
upon the cheek of night


332
0:26:7,89 --> 0:26:11,16
as a rich jewel
in an Ethiop's ear;,


333
0:26:11,16 --> 0:26:18,666
beauty too rich for use,
for earth too dear.


334
0:26:18,666 --> 0:26:22,203
So shows a snowy dove
trooping with crows,


335
0:26:22,203 --> 0:26:31,677
as yonder lady
o'er her fellow shows.


336
0:26:31,677 --> 0:26:34,46
Did my heart love till now?


337
0:26:34,46 --> 0:26:37,617
Forswear it sight,


338
0:26:37,617 --> 0:26:50,694
for I ne'er saw true beauty
till this night.


339
0:26:50,694 --> 0:27:0,77
This by his voice
should be a Montague.


340
0:27:0,77 --> 0:27:4,64
Uncle, this is
a Montague, our foe;


341
0:27:4,64 --> 0:27:6,642
a villain that is
hither come in spite,


342
0:27:6,642 --> 0:27:8,644
to scorn at
our solemnity this night.


343
0:27:8,644 --> 0:27:10,244
Young Romeo is it?


344
0:27:10,244 --> 0:27:12,647
Dares the slave come hither
covered in an antic face,


345
0:27:12,647 --> 0:27:14,482
to fear and scorn
at our solemnity?


346
0:27:14,482 --> 0:27:16,65
'A bears him like
a courtly gentleman;


347
0:27:16,65 --> 0:27:18,652
and to say truth,
Verona brags of him


348
0:27:18,652 --> 0:27:20,654
to be a virtuous
and well managed youth.


349
0:27:20,654 --> 0:27:22,656
I would not for the wealth
of all this town


350
0:27:22,656 --> 0:27:24,657
here in my house
do him disparagement.


351
0:27:24,657 --> 0:27:27,26
Therefore have patience,
take no note of him.


352
0:27:27,26 --> 0:27:29,662
The Moureska!


353
0:27:29,662 --> 0:29:4,556
The Moureska!


354
0:29:4,556 --> 0:29:7,559
Why, Uncle,
'tis a shame!


355
0:29:7,559 --> 0:29:9,127
Go to.


356
0:29:9,127 --> 0:29:11,562
You are a saucy boy.


357
0:29:11,562 --> 0:29:14,65
You'll make a mutiny
among my guests!


358
0:29:14,65 --> 0:29:16,567
Am I the master here,
or you?


359
0:29:16,567 --> 0:29:18,69
I will not endure him.


360
0:29:18,69 --> 0:29:20,27
You will not endure!
He shall be endured!


361
0:29:20,27 --> 0:29:23,573
Or I know what!


362
0:29:23,573 --> 0:29:35,83
Well said, my hearts.


363
0:29:35,83 --> 0:29:37,585
You're a princox.


364
0:29:37,585 --> 0:29:41,289
Be quiet or...


365
0:29:41,289 --> 0:29:47,94
Ah.


366
0:29:47,94 --> 0:30:55,486
For shame!
I'll make you quiet.


367
0:30:55,486 --> 0:30:59,156
Leonardo will sing!


368
0:30:59,156 --> 0:31:12,568
Leonardo, I pray thee, sing.


369
0:31:12,568 --> 0:31:16,438
What is a youth?


370
0:31:16,438 --> 0:31:20,241
Impetuous fire


371
0:31:20,241 --> 0:31:24,178
What is a maid?


372
0:31:24,178 --> 0:31:27,481
Ice and desire


373
0:31:27,481 --> 0:31:30,95
The world wags on


374
0:31:30,95 --> 0:31:35,455
A rose will bloom


375
0:31:35,455 --> 0:31:39,925
It then will fade


376
0:31:39,925 --> 0:31:44,429
So does a youth


377
0:31:44,429 --> 0:31:53,37
So does the fairest maid


378
0:31:53,37 --> 0:31:56,673
Comes the time


379
0:31:56,673 --> 0:31:58,174
When one sweet smile


380
0:31:58,174 --> 0:32:3,712
Has its season for a while


381
0:32:3,712 --> 0:32:9,617
Then love's in love with me


382
0:32:9,617 --> 0:32:13,454
Some may think only to marry


383
0:32:13,454 --> 0:32:17,9
Others will tease and tarry


384
0:32:17,9 --> 0:32:20,527
Mine is the very best parry


385
0:32:20,527 --> 0:32:24,263
Cupid he rules us all


386
0:32:24,263 --> 0:32:27,933
Caper the caper,
sing me the song


387
0:32:27,933 --> 0:32:31,403
Death will come soon
to hush us along


388
0:32:31,403 --> 0:32:34,939
Sweeter than honey
and bitter as gall


389
0:32:34,939 --> 0:32:38,542
Love is a pastime
that never will pall


390
0:32:38,542 --> 0:32:42,613
Sweeter than honey
and bitter as gall


391
0:32:42,613 --> 0:33:7,201
Cupid he rules us all


392
0:33:7,201 --> 0:33:12,72
A rose will bloom


393
0:33:12,72 --> 0:33:16,176
And then will fade


394
0:33:16,176 --> 0:33:23,82
So does a youth


395
0:33:23,82 --> 0:33:34,324
So does the fairest maid


396
0:33:34,324 --> 0:33:38,595
If I profane
with my unworthiest hand


397
0:33:38,595 --> 0:33:41,97
this holy shrine,


398
0:33:41,97 --> 0:33:44,233
the gentle sin is this;


399
0:33:44,233 --> 0:33:50,505
my lips, two blushing pilgrims,
ready stand


400
0:33:50,505 --> 0:33:57,411
to smooth the rough touch
with a gentle kiss.


401
0:33:57,411 --> 0:34:14,59
Oh.


402
0:34:14,59 --> 0:34:20,64
Good pilgrim, you do wrong
your hand too much


403
0:34:20,64 --> 0:34:24,68
which mannerly devotion
shows in this;


404
0:34:24,68 --> 0:34:28,571
for saints have hands
that pilgrims' hands do touch


405
0:34:28,571 --> 0:34:33,575
and palm to palm is
holy palmers' kiss.


406
0:34:33,575 --> 0:34:37,579
Have not saints lips,
and holy palmers too?


407
0:34:37,579 --> 0:34:41,582
Ay, pilgrim, lips that
they must use in prayer.


408
0:34:41,582 --> 0:34:43,84
Oh...


409
0:34:43,84 --> 0:34:47,88
O then, dear saint,


410
0:34:47,88 --> 0:34:56,595
let lips do
what hands do...


411
0:34:56,595 --> 0:35:2,34
They pray,
grant thou,


412
0:35:2,34 --> 0:35:4,536
lest faith
turn to despair.


413
0:35:4,536 --> 0:35:6,538
Saints do not move,


414
0:35:6,538 --> 0:35:8,54
though grants
for prayers' sake.


415
0:35:8,54 --> 0:35:14,44
Then move not...


416
0:35:14,44 --> 0:35:20,49
While my prayer's
effect I take.


417
0:35:20,49 --> 0:35:27,55
Thus from my lips,
by thine,


418
0:35:27,55 --> 0:35:40,568
my sin is purged.


419
0:35:40,568 --> 0:35:44,571
Then have my lips the sin
that they have took.


420
0:35:44,571 --> 0:35:46,573
Sin from my lips!


421
0:35:46,573 --> 0:35:48,575
O trespass sweetly urged!


422
0:35:48,575 --> 0:35:53,245
Give me my sin again.


423
0:35:53,245 --> 0:35:58,82
A rose will bloom


424
0:35:58,82 --> 0:36:1,352
It then will fade


425
0:36:1,352 --> 0:36:7,49
So does a youth


426
0:36:7,49 --> 0:36:29,209
So does the fairest maid


427
0:36:29,209 --> 0:36:30,544
Juliet!


428
0:36:30,544 --> 0:36:33,213
Lady Juliet!


429
0:36:33,213 --> 0:36:34,982
Nurse?


430
0:36:34,982 --> 0:36:40,653
Your mother craves
a word with you.


431
0:36:40,653 --> 0:36:48,59
Make haste, make haste!


432
0:36:48,59 --> 0:36:49,561
What is her mother?


433
0:36:49,561 --> 0:36:51,62
Hmm.
Merry, bachelor,


434
0:36:51,62 --> 0:36:54,64
her mother is
the lady of the house,


435
0:36:54,64 --> 0:36:57,67
and a good lady,
and wise, and virtuous;


436
0:36:57,67 --> 0:36:59,569
I nursed her daughter
that you talked withal.


437
0:36:59,569 --> 0:37:6,508
Hmm.


438
0:37:6,508 --> 0:37:9,511
I tell you he that
shall lay hold of her


439
0:37:9,511 --> 0:37:13,749
shall have the chinks.


440
0:37:13,749 --> 0:37:18,919
Is she a Capulet?


441
0:37:18,919 --> 0:37:22,22
Ah, dear account!


442
0:37:22,22 --> 0:37:30,262
My life is my foe's debt.


443
0:37:30,262 --> 0:37:33,232
What, ho, my mistresses?


444
0:37:33,232 --> 0:37:35,34
What, will you be gone?


445
0:37:35,34 --> 0:37:37,535
It seems so, poor God,
it is so very late.


446
0:37:37,535 --> 0:37:39,804
We'll call it early,
by and by.


447
0:37:39,804 --> 0:37:47,44
Good night,
sweet, my Lady Juliet.


448
0:37:47,44 --> 0:37:48,545
Come hither, nurse.


449
0:37:48,545 --> 0:37:50,547
Hmm?


450
0:37:50,547 --> 0:37:52,182
What is yon gentleman?


451
0:37:52,182 --> 0:37:53,549
Count Paris.


452
0:37:53,549 --> 0:37:59,188
No. What's he
that follows there?


453
0:37:59,188 --> 0:38:0,989
Oh! I know not.


454
0:38:0,989 --> 0:38:5,493
Go, ask his name.


455
0:38:5,493 --> 0:38:8,495
Hmm. Romeo, of
the house of Montague.


456
0:38:8,495 --> 0:38:10,13
What?


457
0:38:10,13 --> 0:38:13,133
His name is Romeo,
and a Montague;


458
0:38:13,133 --> 0:38:22,508
the only son of
your great enemy.


459
0:38:22,508 --> 0:38:27,512
My only love sprung
from my only hate,


460
0:38:27,512 --> 0:38:34,518
too early seen unknown,
and known too late!


461
0:38:34,518 --> 0:38:36,2
Oh!


462
0:38:36,2 --> 0:38:39,22
Prodigious birth of love
it is to me


463
0:38:39,22 --> 0:38:51,533
that I must love
a loathed enemy.


464
0:38:51,533 --> 0:38:53,35
Juliet!


465
0:38:53,35 --> 0:38:55,57
My Lady Juliet!


466
0:38:55,57 --> 0:38:59,4
Madam!


467
0:38:59,4 --> 0:39:6,813
Romeo!


468
0:39:6,813 --> 0:39:9,482
Juliet!


469
0:39:9,482 --> 0:39:12,985
Romeo!


470
0:39:12,985 --> 0:39:16,921
Lady Juliet!


471
0:39:16,921 --> 0:39:18,49
Juliet!


472
0:39:18,49 --> 0:39:25,496
Romeo!


473
0:39:25,496 --> 0:39:27,998
Romeo!


474
0:39:27,998 --> 0:39:32,1
Romeo!


475
0:39:32,1 --> 0:39:35,4
Romeo!


476
0:39:35,4 --> 0:39:37,507
Romeo!


477
0:39:37,507 --> 0:39:39,108
Romeo!


478
0:39:39,108 --> 0:39:41,51
Romeo!


479
0:39:41,51 --> 0:39:44,513
Romeo!


480
0:39:44,513 --> 0:39:48,15
1, 2, 3.


481
0:39:48,15 --> 0:39:53,521
- Romeo!
- Romeo!


482
0:39:53,521 --> 0:39:55,21
He is wise,


483
0:39:55,21 --> 0:39:58,224
and on my life hath
stolen him home to bed.


484
0:39:58,224 --> 0:39:59,526
He leaped
this orchard wall.


485
0:39:59,526 --> 0:40:0,727
Call, good Mercutio.


486
0:40:0,727 --> 0:40:5,23
Romeo!


487
0:40:5,23 --> 0:40:7,266
Romeo! Passion! Lover!


488
0:40:7,266 --> 0:40:9,802
O-hooo! Madman!


489
0:40:9,802 --> 0:40:12,203
O-hooo! Romeo!


490
0:40:12,203 --> 0:40:16,374
He heareth not,
he stirreth not, he moveth not.


491
0:40:16,374 --> 0:40:17,875
The ape is dead.


492
0:40:17,875 --> 0:40:23,942
He jests at scars
that never felt a wound.


493
0:40:23,942 --> 0:40:29,513
Romeo, it's all right.


494
0:40:29,513 --> 0:40:31,415
But soft,


495
0:40:31,415 --> 0:41:1,942
what light through
yonder window breaks?


496
0:41:1,942 --> 0:41:4,276
It is my lady,


497
0:41:4,276 --> 0:41:9,381
oh, it is my love.


498
0:41:9,381 --> 0:41:11,35
Oh...


499
0:41:11,35 --> 0:41:14,886
O that she knew she were.


500
0:41:14,886 --> 0:41:18,389
She speaks,
yet she says nothing.


501
0:41:18,389 --> 0:41:22,392
What of that?


502
0:41:22,392 --> 0:41:26,896
Her eye discourses,
I will answer it.


503
0:41:26,896 --> 0:41:29,899
I am too bold,


504
0:41:29,899 --> 0:41:32,902
'tis not to me she speaks.


505
0:41:32,902 --> 0:41:37,405
Two of the fairest stars
in all the heavens,


506
0:41:37,405 --> 0:41:40,909
having some business,
do entreat her eyes


507
0:41:40,909 --> 0:41:44,912
to twinkle in their spheres
till they return.


508
0:41:44,912 --> 0:41:48,48
See how she leans her cheek
upon her hand.


509
0:41:48,48 --> 0:41:51,551
Oh, that I were
a glove upon that hand,


510
0:41:51,551 --> 0:41:55,922
that I might touch
that cheek.


511
0:41:55,922 --> 0:41:57,756
Ay me!


512
0:41:57,756 --> 0:42:5,162
She speaks.


513
0:42:5,162 --> 0:42:8,566
Oh, speak again,
bright angel.


514
0:42:8,566 --> 0:42:13,37
O Romeo, Romeo,


515
0:42:13,37 --> 0:42:16,873
wherefore art thou, Romeo?


516
0:42:16,873 --> 0:42:22,11
Deny thy father,
and refuse thy name.


517
0:42:22,11 --> 0:42:26,15
Or if thou wilt not,
be but sworn my love,


518
0:42:26,15 --> 0:42:28,383
and I'll no longer
be a Capulet.


519
0:42:28,383 --> 0:42:29,884
Shall I hear more,


520
0:42:29,884 --> 0:42:31,886
or shall I speak at this?


521
0:42:31,886 --> 0:42:33,888
'Tis but thy name
that is my enemy.


522
0:42:33,888 --> 0:42:40,227
Thou art thyself,
though not a Montague.


523
0:42:40,227 --> 0:42:43,397
What is Montague?


524
0:42:43,397 --> 0:42:49,35
It is nor hand nor foot,
nor arm nor face


525
0:42:49,35 --> 0:42:52,904
nor any other part
belonging to a man.


526
0:42:52,904 --> 0:42:57,909
O be some other name.


527
0:42:57,909 --> 0:43:0,144
What's in a name?


528
0:43:0,144 --> 0:43:2,646
That which we call a rose


529
0:43:2,646 --> 0:43:5,649
by any other name
would smell as sweet;


530
0:43:5,649 --> 0:43:9,352
so Romeo would,
were he not Romeo called,


531
0:43:9,352 --> 0:43:11,854
retain that dear perfection


532
0:43:11,854 --> 0:43:14,89
which he owes
without that title.


533
0:43:14,89 --> 0:43:18,36
Romeo, doff thy name,


534
0:43:18,36 --> 0:43:21,363
and for that name
which is no part of thee,


535
0:43:21,363 --> 0:43:26,2
take all myself.


536
0:43:26,2 --> 0:43:28,569
I'll take thee
at thy word.


537
0:43:28,569 --> 0:43:30,637
Call me but love,
and I'll be new baptized;


538
0:43:30,637 --> 0:43:33,873
henceforth I never
will be Romeo.


539
0:43:33,873 --> 0:43:37,376
What man art thou,
that thus bescreened in night


540
0:43:37,376 --> 0:43:39,144
so stumblest
on my counsel?


541
0:43:39,144 --> 0:43:43,15
By a name I know not how to
tell thee who I am.


542
0:43:43,15 --> 0:43:44,882
My name, dear saint,
is hateful to myself,


543
0:43:44,882 --> 0:43:46,317
because it is
an enemy to thee.


544
0:43:46,317 --> 0:43:51,889
Had I it written,
I would tear the word.


545
0:43:51,889 --> 0:43:54,391
My ears have not yet drunk


546
0:43:54,391 --> 0:43:57,394
a hundred words
of that tongue's utterance,


547
0:43:57,394 --> 0:43:59,396
yet I know the sound.


548
0:43:59,396 --> 0:44:2,531
Art thou not Romeo,
and a Montague?


549
0:44:2,531 --> 0:44:5,34
Neither, fair maid,
if either thee dislike.


550
0:44:5,34 --> 0:44:7,836
How cam'st thou hither,
tell me and wherefore?


551
0:44:7,836 --> 0:44:10,338
The orchard walls are
high and hard to climb,


552
0:44:10,338 --> 0:44:12,674
and the place death,
considering who thou art,


553
0:44:12,674 --> 0:44:15,343
if any of my kinsmen
find thee here.


554
0:44:15,343 --> 0:44:16,844
With love's light wings


555
0:44:16,844 --> 0:44:18,846
did I o'er perch
these walls,


556
0:44:18,846 --> 0:44:21,348
for stony limits
cannot hold love out,


557
0:44:21,348 --> 0:44:24,35
and what love can do,
that dares love attempt.


558
0:44:24,35 --> 0:44:26,152
Therefore thy kinsmen
are no stop to me.


559
0:44:26,152 --> 0:44:29,355
Sshhh!


560
0:44:29,355 --> 0:44:32,391
If they do see thee,
they will murder thee.


561
0:44:32,391 --> 0:44:36,862
I have night's cloak to
hide me from their eyes.


562
0:44:36,862 --> 0:44:41,699
And but thou love me...


563
0:44:41,699 --> 0:44:43,701
Let them find me here


564
0:44:43,701 --> 0:44:46,703
my life were better
ended by their hate,


565
0:44:46,703 --> 0:44:53,875
than death prorogued,
wanting of thy love.


566
0:44:53,875 --> 0:44:55,843
Dost thou love me?


567
0:44:55,843 --> 0:44:59,8
I know thou wilt say ay,
and I will take thy word;


568
0:44:59,8 --> 0:45:0,581
yet if thou swearest,


569
0:45:0,581 --> 0:45:2,15
thou mayst prove false;


570
0:45:2,15 --> 0:45:6,486
at lovers' perjuries
they say jove laughs.


571
0:45:6,486 --> 0:45:8,822
O gentle Romeo,


572
0:45:8,822 --> 0:45:13,993
if thou dost love,
pronounce it faithfully.


573
0:45:13,993 --> 0:45:16,828
Or if thou thinkest
I am too quickly won,


574
0:45:16,828 --> 0:45:20,398
I'll frown and be perverse,
and say thee nay,


575
0:45:20,398 --> 0:45:23,768
so thou wilt woo
but else not for the world.


576
0:45:23,768 --> 0:45:32,8
In truth, fair Montague,
I am too fond...


577
0:45:32,8 --> 0:45:34,51
And therefore thou mayst think
my haviour light.


578
0:45:34,51 --> 0:45:35,678
No.


579
0:45:35,678 --> 0:45:38,514
But trust me, gentleman,
I'll prove more true


580
0:45:38,514 --> 0:45:43,518
than those that have
more cunning to be strange.


581
0:45:43,518 --> 0:45:46,21
I should have been
more strange,


582
0:45:46,21 --> 0:45:47,521
I must confess,


583
0:45:47,521 --> 0:45:50,524
but that thou overheard'st,
ere I was ware,


584
0:45:50,524 --> 0:45:53,27
my true love's passion;


585
0:45:53,27 --> 0:45:56,963
therefore pardon me,


586
0:45:56,963 --> 0:45:59,966
and not impute this yielding
to light love,


587
0:45:59,966 --> 0:46:2,901
which the dark night
hath so discovered.


588
0:46:2,901 --> 0:46:6,472
Lady, by yonder
blessed moon, I swear.


589
0:46:6,472 --> 0:46:8,44
Oh, swear not by the moon,


590
0:46:8,44 --> 0:46:9,975
th'inconstant moon,


591
0:46:9,975 --> 0:46:14,479
that monthly changes
in her circled orb,


592
0:46:14,479 --> 0:46:18,582
lest that thy love prove
likewise variable.


593
0:46:18,582 --> 0:46:21,51
What shall I swear by?


594
0:46:21,51 --> 0:46:23,53
Do not swear at all.


595
0:46:23,53 --> 0:46:27,49
Or if thou wilt...


596
0:46:27,49 --> 0:46:29,492
Swear by thy gracious self,


597
0:46:29,492 --> 0:46:32,495
which is the god
of my idolatry,


598
0:46:32,495 --> 0:46:34,996
and I'll believe thee.


599
0:46:34,996 --> 0:46:40,68
If my heart's dear love,
I swear...


600
0:46:40,68 --> 0:46:58,16
Oh, Juliet!


601
0:46:58,16 --> 0:47:1,453
Sweet, good night.


602
0:47:1,453 --> 0:47:4,955
This bud of love
by summer's ripening breath


603
0:47:4,955 --> 0:47:15,465
may prove a beauteous flower
when next we meet.


604
0:47:15,465 --> 0:47:20,135
Good night, good night.


605
0:47:20,135 --> 0:47:23,639
As sweet repose and rest
come to thy heart


606
0:47:23,639 --> 0:47:32,48
as that
within my breast.


607
0:47:32,48 --> 0:47:36,516
O, wilt thou leave me
so unsatisfied?


608
0:47:36,516 --> 0:47:39,853
What satisfaction
canst thou have tonight?


609
0:47:39,853 --> 0:47:43,756
Th' exchange of thy love's
faithful vow for mine.


610
0:47:43,756 --> 0:47:54,999
Ahh.


611
0:47:54,999 --> 0:47:59,2
I gave thee mine before
thou didst request it.


612
0:47:59,2 --> 0:48:4,441
And yet I would it were
to give again.


613
0:48:4,441 --> 0:48:6,442
Wouldst thou
withdraw it?


614
0:48:6,442 --> 0:48:8,778
For what purpose, love?


615
0:48:8,778 --> 0:48:17,252
But to be frank
and give it thee again.


616
0:48:17,252 --> 0:48:23,457
And yet I wish
but for the thing I have,


617
0:48:23,457 --> 0:48:26,46
my bounty is
as boundless as the sea,


618
0:48:26,46 --> 0:48:27,962
my love as deep.


619
0:48:27,962 --> 0:48:30,964
The more I give to thee,
the more I have,


620
0:48:30,964 --> 0:48:32,966
for both are infinite.


621
0:48:32,966 --> 0:48:34,467
Juliet!


622
0:48:34,467 --> 0:48:35,968
Anon, good nurse!


623
0:48:35,968 --> 0:48:39,471
Sweet Montague, be true.


624
0:48:39,471 --> 0:48:41,974
Madam!


625
0:48:41,974 --> 0:48:44,976
Stay but a little,
I will come again.


626
0:48:44,976 --> 0:48:55,485
Madam! Lady Juliet!


627
0:48:55,485 --> 0:48:59,822
O blessed, blessed night!


628
0:48:59,822 --> 0:49:2,758
Oh! I am afeard,
being in night,


629
0:49:2,758 --> 0:49:4,927
all this is but a dream,


630
0:49:4,927 --> 0:49:7,428
too flattering-sweet
to be substantial.


631
0:49:7,428 --> 0:49:11,499
Three words, dear Romeo,
and good night indeed.


632
0:49:11,499 --> 0:49:14,434
If that thy bent of love
be honorable,


633
0:49:14,434 --> 0:49:16,937
thy purpose marriage,
send me word tomorrow,


634
0:49:16,937 --> 0:49:19,506
by one that I'll procure
to come to thee.


635
0:49:19,506 --> 0:49:22,441
Where and what time
thou wilt perform the rite,


636
0:49:22,441 --> 0:49:24,944
and all my fortunes
at thy foot I'll lay


637
0:49:24,944 --> 0:49:27,68
and follow thee, my lord,
throughout the world.


638
0:49:27,68 --> 0:49:28,948
Madam!


639
0:49:28,948 --> 0:49:32,83
I come, anon.


640
0:49:32,83 --> 0:49:35,453
But if thou meanest not well,
I do beseech thee--


641
0:49:35,453 --> 0:49:36,621
Lady Juliet!


642
0:49:36,621 --> 0:49:37,955
By and by I come!


643
0:49:37,955 --> 0:49:41,191
To cease thy suit
and leave me to my grief.


644
0:49:41,191 --> 0:49:42,693
Tomorrow will I send.


645
0:49:42,693 --> 0:49:45,328
So thrive my soul.


646
0:49:45,328 --> 0:49:51,768
A thousand times
good night!


647
0:49:51,768 --> 0:49:53,468
Romeo!


648
0:49:53,468 --> 0:49:56,271
At what o'clock tomorrow
shall I send to thee?


649
0:49:56,271 --> 0:49:57,472
At the hour of nine.


650
0:49:57,472 --> 0:49:59,474
I will not fail.


651
0:49:59,474 --> 0:50:3,77
'Tis twenty years
till then.


652
0:50:3,77 --> 0:50:12,485
Romeo!


653
0:50:12,485 --> 0:50:16,321
I have forgot
why I did call thee back.


654
0:50:16,321 --> 0:50:18,49
Let me stand here
till thou remember it.


655
0:50:18,49 --> 0:50:21,994
I shall forget, to have
thee still stand there,


656
0:50:21,994 --> 0:50:23,227
remembering how
I love thy company.


657
0:50:23,227 --> 0:50:24,729
And I'll still stay,


658
0:50:24,729 --> 0:50:26,731
to have thee
still forget,


659
0:50:26,731 --> 0:50:29,734
forgetting
any other home but this.


660
0:50:29,734 --> 0:50:56,824
Ahh.


661
0:50:56,824 --> 0:50:59,827
Good night, good night!


662
0:50:59,827 --> 0:51:3,463
Parting is
such sweet sorrow


663
0:51:3,463 --> 0:51:47,768
that I shall say good night
till it be morrow.


664
0:51:47,768 --> 0:52:15,592
Woo!


665
0:52:15,592 --> 0:53:7,204
Woo!


666
0:53:7,204 --> 0:53:10,14
Friar Laurence!


667
0:53:10,14 --> 0:53:12,942
What early tongue
so sweet saluteth me?


668
0:53:12,942 --> 0:53:14,944
Good morrow, father!


669
0:53:14,944 --> 0:53:16,946
Ha ha ha!


670
0:53:16,946 --> 0:53:22,431
Hey!


671
0:53:22,431 --> 0:53:25,2
Young son, it argues
a distempered head


672
0:53:25,2 --> 0:53:28,703
so soon to bid
good morrow to thy bed.


673
0:53:28,703 --> 0:53:30,805
Therefore thy earliness
doth me assure


674
0:53:30,805 --> 0:53:32,807
thou art uproused with
some distemperature.


675
0:53:32,807 --> 0:53:36,309
Or if not so,
then here I put it right


676
0:53:36,309 --> 0:53:38,812
our Romeo hath not
been in bed tonight.


677
0:53:38,812 --> 0:53:42,49
The last is true.
The sweeter rest was mine.


678
0:53:42,49 --> 0:53:44,316
God pardon sin!
Wast thou with Rosaline?


679
0:53:44,316 --> 0:53:46,819
With Rosaline,
my ghostly father, no.


680
0:53:46,819 --> 0:53:49,821
I have forgot that name
and that name's woe.


681
0:53:49,821 --> 0:53:51,322
That's my good son.


682
0:53:51,322 --> 0:53:53,324
Well, where hast
thou been then?


683
0:53:53,324 --> 0:53:55,827
I'll tell thee ere
thou ask it me again.


684
0:53:55,827 --> 0:53:58,328
I have been feasting
with mine enemy,


685
0:53:58,328 --> 0:54:0,764
where on a sudden
one hath wounded me.


686
0:54:0,764 --> 0:54:3,767
Be plain, good son,
and homely in thy drift.


687
0:54:3,767 --> 0:54:5,968
Riddling confession finds
but riddling shrift.


688
0:54:5,968 --> 0:54:9,772
Then plainly know
my heart's dear love is set,


689
0:54:9,772 --> 0:54:12,275
on the fair daughter
of rich Capulet.


690
0:54:12,275 --> 0:54:15,777
As mine on hers,
so hers is set on mine,


691
0:54:15,777 --> 0:54:18,28
and all combined,
save what thou must combine


692
0:54:18,28 --> 0:54:20,282
by holy marriage.


693
0:54:20,282 --> 0:54:22,283
When and where,
and how we met,


694
0:54:22,283 --> 0:54:24,785
we woo'd, and made
exchange of vow,


695
0:54:24,785 --> 0:54:26,187
I'll tell thee as we pass.


696
0:54:26,187 --> 0:54:27,788
But this I pray,


697
0:54:27,788 --> 0:54:30,123
that thou consent
to marry us today.


698
0:54:30,123 --> 0:54:32,292
Hmmm?


699
0:54:32,292 --> 0:54:34,561
Holy Saint Francis!


700
0:54:34,561 --> 0:54:36,795
Is Rosaline,
that thou didst love so dear,


701
0:54:36,795 --> 0:54:38,297
so soon forsaken?


702
0:54:38,297 --> 0:54:40,299
Thou doest not mock me, Father!


703
0:54:40,299 --> 0:54:43,302
Young men's love then lies
not truly in their hearts,


704
0:54:43,302 --> 0:54:44,802
but in their eyes.


705
0:54:44,802 --> 0:54:46,304
Hear me, Father.


706
0:54:46,304 --> 0:54:48,306
Jesu Maria!
What a deal of brine


707
0:54:48,306 --> 0:54:50,808
hath washed thy sallow cheeks
for Rosaline!


708
0:54:50,808 --> 0:54:52,309
And art thou changed?


709
0:54:52,309 --> 0:54:53,81
Pronounce this
sentence then.


710
0:54:53,81 --> 0:54:56,813
Women may fall when
there's no strength in men.


711
0:54:56,813 --> 0:54:59,315
Thou chidst me oft
for loving Rosaline.


712
0:54:59,315 --> 0:55:1,317
Doting, not for loving,
pupil mine.


713
0:55:1,317 --> 0:55:4,487
Yes, for loving and,
and badest me bury love.


714
0:55:4,487 --> 0:55:7,489
Not in a grave
to lay one in,


715
0:55:7,489 --> 0:55:24,27
another out to have.


716
0:55:24,27 --> 0:55:26,773
Come, young waverer,


717
0:55:26,773 --> 0:55:29,275
come, go with me.


718
0:55:29,275 --> 0:55:33,278
In one respect
I'll thy assistant be.


719
0:55:33,278 --> 0:55:36,114
O Father!


720
0:55:36,114 --> 0:55:38,783
For this alliance
may so happy prove


721
0:55:38,783 --> 0:55:41,285
to turn your households'
rancor to pure love.


722
0:55:41,285 --> 0:55:42,787
O, let us hence!


723
0:55:42,787 --> 0:55:44,788
I stand on sudden haste.


724
0:55:44,788 --> 0:55:46,289
Shh! Wisely and slow,


725
0:55:46,289 --> 0:55:49,292
they stumble
that run fast.


726
0:55:49,292 --> 0:55:50,794
Ha ha ha!


727
0:55:50,794 --> 0:55:56,298
Shh!


728
0:55:56,298 --> 0:55:58,801
Where the devil
should this Romeo be?


729
0:55:58,801 --> 0:56:1,736
Hmm?


730
0:56:1,736 --> 0:56:3,738
Came he not home tonight?


731
0:56:3,738 --> 0:56:6,24
Hmm?


732
0:56:6,24 --> 0:56:7,741
Huh?


733
0:56:7,741 --> 0:56:9,743
Came he not home tonight?


734
0:56:9,743 --> 0:56:10,744
Who?


735
0:56:10,744 --> 0:56:11,945
Romeo.


736
0:56:11,945 --> 0:56:15,748
O no, not to his father's.
I spoke with his man.


737
0:56:15,748 --> 0:56:18,25
Hey, Tybalt, the kinsman
to old Capulet,


738
0:56:18,25 --> 0:56:22,755
hath sent a letter
to his father's house.


739
0:56:22,755 --> 0:56:24,756
A challenge, on my life.


740
0:56:24,756 --> 0:56:26,257
Romeo will answer it.


741
0:56:26,257 --> 0:56:29,26
Any man that can write
may answer a letter.


742
0:56:29,26 --> 0:56:32,262
Nay, he will answer
the letter's master,


743
0:56:32,262 --> 0:56:34,264
how he dares,
being dared.


744
0:56:34,264 --> 0:56:36,767
Alas, poor Romeo,
he is already dead;


745
0:56:36,767 --> 0:56:39,268
stabbed with
a white wench's black eye;


746
0:56:39,268 --> 0:56:42,271
run through the ear
with a love song;


747
0:56:42,271 --> 0:56:45,274
the very pin
of his heart cleft


748
0:56:45,274 --> 0:56:50,48
with the blind
bow-boy's buttshaft.


749
0:56:50,48 --> 0:56:53,249
And is he a man
to encounter Tybalt?


750
0:56:53,249 --> 0:56:56,151
Why, what is Tybalt!


751
0:56:56,151 --> 0:57:5,393
More than Prince of Cats,
I can tell you.


752
0:57:5,393 --> 0:57:12,232
Ah, good morrow
to you both.


753
0:57:12,232 --> 0:57:14,735
That we should be
thus afflicted


754
0:57:14,735 --> 0:57:17,236
with these
strange flies,


755
0:57:17,236 --> 0:57:19,238
these fashionmongers,


756
0:57:19,238 --> 0:57:22,742
these pardonnez moi's.


757
0:57:22,742 --> 0:57:24,243
Ah, Signor Romeo,


758
0:57:24,243 --> 0:57:25,744
Bonjour.


759
0:57:25,744 --> 0:57:27,245
Bonjour.


760
0:57:27,245 --> 0:57:29,748
There's a French salutation
to your French slop.


761
0:57:29,748 --> 0:57:31,249
Huh?


762
0:57:31,249 --> 0:57:33,751
You gave us the counterfeit
fairly last night.


763
0:57:33,751 --> 0:57:35,753
What counterfeit
did I give you?


764
0:57:35,753 --> 0:57:37,755
The slip, sir, the slip,


765
0:57:37,755 --> 0:57:39,223
can you not conceive?


766
0:57:39,223 --> 0:57:40,623
Pardon, good Mercutio.


767
0:57:40,623 --> 0:57:42,24
My business was great--


768
0:57:42,24 --> 0:57:43,259
Oh! Ha ha ha!


769
0:57:43,259 --> 0:57:45,261
In such a case as mine


770
0:57:45,261 --> 0:57:46,763
a man may strain courtesy.


771
0:57:46,763 --> 0:57:48,263
Come between us,
good Benvolio;


772
0:57:48,263 --> 0:57:49,765
my wit faints.


773
0:57:49,765 --> 0:57:51,767
Thy wit is
very bitter sweeting


774
0:57:51,767 --> 0:57:53,268
it is most sharp sauce.


775
0:57:53,268 --> 0:57:55,269
Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh!


776
0:57:55,269 --> 0:57:56,771
Ha ha ha!


777
0:57:56,771 --> 0:57:58,773
Why, is not this
better now


778
0:57:58,773 --> 0:58:0,975
than groaning for love?


779
0:58:0,975 --> 0:58:3,71
Now art thou sociable,


780
0:58:3,71 --> 0:58:5,712
now art thou Romeo;


781
0:58:5,712 --> 0:58:8,214
now art thou
what thou art,


782
0:58:8,214 --> 0:58:11,183
by art as well as
by nature.


783
0:58:11,183 --> 0:58:13,719
For this driveling love
is like a great natural


784
0:58:13,719 --> 0:58:15,22
that runs malling
up and down


785
0:58:15,22 --> 0:58:17,222
to hide his bauble
in a hole.


786
0:58:17,222 --> 0:58:18,723
Stop there,
stop there.


787
0:58:18,723 --> 0:58:21,726
Thou desirest me to stop
in my tale against the hair?


788
0:58:21,726 --> 0:58:23,728
Thou wouldst else
have made thy tale large.


789
0:58:23,728 --> 0:58:25,229
No, no, no,
thou art deceived;


790
0:58:25,229 --> 0:58:28,732
For I was come to
the whole depth of my tale,


791
0:58:28,732 --> 0:58:36,16
and meant to occupy
the argument no longer.


792
0:58:36,16 --> 0:58:39,163
Here's goodly gear.


793
0:58:39,163 --> 0:58:41,998
Here's a fine barge.


794
0:58:41,998 --> 0:58:43,166
A sail.


795
0:58:43,166 --> 0:58:50,139
A sail, a sail.


796
0:58:50,139 --> 0:58:56,678
Two, two; a shirt
and a smock.


797
0:58:56,678 --> 0:58:58,179
Shh!


798
0:58:58,179 --> 0:58:59,214
Peter.


799
0:58:59,214 --> 0:59:1,616
Anon.


800
0:59:1,616 --> 0:59:3,785
My fan, Peter.


801
0:59:3,785 --> 0:59:5,352
Good, Peter,
to hide her face,


802
0:59:5,352 --> 0:59:7,621
for her fan's
the fairer of the two.


803
0:59:7,621 --> 0:59:9,489
Ha ha ha!


804
0:59:9,489 --> 0:59:12,124
Oh!


805
0:59:12,124 --> 0:59:14,66
God ye good morrow,
gentlemen.


806
0:59:14,66 --> 0:59:16,996
God ye good den,
fair gentlewoman.


807
0:59:16,996 --> 0:59:18,531
Is it good den,
I pray?


808
0:59:18,531 --> 0:59:21,132
Well, 'tis no less
I tell you,


809
0:59:21,132 --> 0:59:23,501
for the bawdy hand
of the dial


810
0:59:23,501 --> 0:59:25,503
is now upon the prick
of noon.


811
0:59:25,503 --> 0:59:27,137
Ha ha ha! Oh!


812
0:59:27,137 --> 0:59:29,84
Out upon you,
what a man are you?


813
0:59:29,84 --> 0:59:33,644
One, gentlewoman, that God
hath made himself to mar.


814
0:59:33,644 --> 0:59:36,646
By my troth
it is well said,


815
0:59:36,646 --> 0:59:39,148
for himself to mar
quoth 'a?


816
0:59:39,148 --> 0:59:40,65
Hmm.


817
0:59:40,65 --> 0:59:43,652
Gentleman, can any
of you tell me


818
0:59:43,652 --> 0:59:45,354
where I may find
young Romeo?


819
0:59:45,354 --> 0:59:49,157
Romeo, Romeo.


820
0:59:49,157 --> 0:59:50,658
Hey!


821
0:59:50,658 --> 0:59:52,159
Shh!


822
0:59:52,159 --> 0:59:54,662
I am the youngest
of that name


823
0:59:54,662 --> 0:59:56,163
for fault of a worse.


824
0:59:56,163 --> 0:59:58,665
If you be he, sir,


825
0:59:58,665 --> 1:0:6,705
I desire some
conference with you.


826
1:0:6,705 --> 1:0:9,108
She will indite him
to some supper.


827
1:0:9,108 --> 1:0:16,114
A bawd, a bawd.


828
1:0:16,114 --> 1:0:22,953
A bawd!


829
1:0:22,953 --> 1:0:25,122
You filthy varmint you!


830
1:0:25,122 --> 1:0:27,57
Here she comes!


831
1:0:27,57 --> 1:0:30,626
Mercutio, no!


832
1:0:30,626 --> 1:0:33,129
An old hare hoar


833
1:0:33,129 --> 1:0:35,93
And an old hare hoar


834
1:0:35,93 --> 1:0:39,768
Is very good meat,
in lent


835
1:0:39,768 --> 1:0:43,138
But a hare
that is a hoar


836
1:0:43,138 --> 1:0:47,207
Is too much
for a score


837
1:0:47,207 --> 1:0:58,251
When it hoars
ere it be spent


838
1:0:58,251 --> 1:1:7,24
Farewell, ancient lady.


839
1:1:7,24 --> 1:1:11,95
Scurvy knave,
scurvy knave.


840
1:1:11,95 --> 1:1:13,331
I'm none of
his flirt-gills.


841
1:1:13,331 --> 1:1:16,266
I'm none of
his skein mates.


842
1:1:16,266 --> 1:1:19,102
Er, cur, lousy knave,


843
1:1:19,102 --> 1:1:22,104
lousy, lousy knave.


844
1:1:22,104 --> 1:1:23,439
I pray you, sir.


845
1:1:23,439 --> 1:1:25,441
What saucy merchant
was this


846
1:1:25,441 --> 1:1:27,276
that was so full
of his property?


847
1:1:27,276 --> 1:1:29,911
A gentleman, nurse, that loves
to hear himself talk,


848
1:1:29,911 --> 1:1:31,946
and will speak
more in a minute


849
1:1:31,946 --> 1:1:33,948
than he will stand to
in a month.


850
1:1:33,948 --> 1:1:35,283
I'll take him down,


851
1:1:35,283 --> 1:1:37,25
an 'a were lustier
than he is,


852
1:1:37,25 --> 1:1:38,585
and twenty such jacks;


853
1:1:38,585 --> 1:1:42,89
and if I cannot,
I'll find those that shall.


854
1:1:42,89 --> 1:1:45,191
Ha ha ha!


855
1:1:45,191 --> 1:1:49,128
Ha ha ha!


856
1:1:49,128 --> 1:1:53,631
And thou must
stand by too


857
1:1:53,631 --> 1:1:56,101
and suffer every knave


858
1:1:56,101 --> 1:1:58,837
to use me
at his pleasure.


859
1:1:58,837 --> 1:2:2,573
Ooh...


860
1:2:2,573 --> 1:2:5,576
Punk rampant!


861
1:2:5,576 --> 1:2:8,578
Pray you, sir,
a word.


862
1:2:8,578 --> 1:2:15,84
Ooh!


863
1:2:15,84 --> 1:2:59,623
Beef wit.


864
1:2:59,623 --> 1:3:3,559
My young lady bid me
inquire you out.


865
1:3:3,559 --> 1:3:6,61
What she did
bid me say,


866
1:3:6,61 --> 1:3:8,63
I will keep to myself;,


867
1:3:8,63 --> 1:3:10,565
but first
let me tell ye,


868
1:3:10,565 --> 1:3:14,68
if ye should lead her
in a fool's paradise--


869
1:3:14,68 --> 1:3:15,57
Nurse.


870
1:3:15,57 --> 1:3:17,7
Shh! As they say,


871
1:3:17,7 --> 1:3:19,573
it were a very gross
kind of behavior;,


872
1:3:19,573 --> 1:3:21,74
for the gentlewoman
is young;


873
1:3:21,74 --> 1:3:23,577
and therefore if you
should deal double with her,


874
1:3:23,577 --> 1:3:27,79
it were an ill thing to be
offered to any gentlewoman,


875
1:3:27,79 --> 1:3:28,581
and very
weak dealing.


876
1:3:28,581 --> 1:3:32,83
Nurse, commend me
to thy lady and mistress,


877
1:3:32,83 --> 1:3:34,186
I protest unto thee.


878
1:3:34,186 --> 1:3:35,687
Bid her devise,


879
1:3:35,687 --> 1:3:39,9
some means to come to
shrift this afternoon,


880
1:3:39,9 --> 1:3:43,93
and there she shall
at Friar Laurence's cell


881
1:3:43,93 --> 1:3:47,297
be shrived and married.


882
1:3:47,297 --> 1:3:49,599
Oh!


883
1:3:49,599 --> 1:3:52,602
Oh!


884
1:3:52,602 --> 1:3:54,137
Here's for thy pains.


885
1:3:54,137 --> 1:3:57,105
No, no truly, sir,
not a penny.


886
1:3:57,105 --> 1:3:59,107
Go to,
I say you shall.


887
1:3:59,107 --> 1:4:0,275
No.


888
1:4:0,275 --> 1:4:5,546
Well...


889
1:4:5,546 --> 1:4:8,649
Sir, my mistress
is the sweetest lady.


890
1:4:8,649 --> 1:4:11,551
Lord, Lord, when she were
a little prating thing.


891
1:4:11,551 --> 1:4:13,53
Good-bye. Oh!


892
1:4:13,53 --> 1:4:15,55
O there is
a noble man in town,


893
1:4:15,55 --> 1:4:17,57
One Paris, that would fain
lay knife aboard.


894
1:4:17,57 --> 1:4:21,6
I anger her sometimes and say
that Paris is the properer man.


895
1:4:21,6 --> 1:4:23,562
Nurse, commend me
to thy lady.


896
1:4:23,562 --> 1:4:25,64
A thousand times.


897
1:4:25,64 --> 1:4:54,89
Ooh! Ooh!


898
1:4:54,89 --> 1:4:58,92
The clock struck nine
when I did send the nurse,


899
1:4:58,92 --> 1:5:2,29
in half an hour
she promised to return...


900
1:5:2,29 --> 1:5:4,531
perchance
she cannot meet him;


901
1:5:4,531 --> 1:5:6,533
ahh, that's not so,


902
1:5:6,533 --> 1:5:8,535
oh, she's lame,


903
1:5:8,535 --> 1:5:12,538
love's heralds
should be thoughts!


904
1:5:12,538 --> 1:5:15,4
Had she affections
and warm youthful blood,


905
1:5:15,4 --> 1:5:17,543
she would be
as swift in motion


906
1:5:17,543 --> 1:5:19,44
as a ball.


907
1:5:19,44 --> 1:5:23,47
But old folks,
many feign as they were dead,


908
1:5:23,47 --> 1:5:27,5
unwieldy, slow, heavy...


909
1:5:27,5 --> 1:5:33,557
And pale as lead.


910
1:5:33,557 --> 1:5:35,57
O God, she comes.


911
1:5:35,57 --> 1:5:36,492
O honey nurse,
what news?


912
1:5:36,492 --> 1:5:39,562
O Lord, why look'st
thou sad?


913
1:5:39,562 --> 1:5:41,63
Oh!


914
1:5:41,63 --> 1:5:42,564
Though news be sad,


915
1:5:42,564 --> 1:5:45,567
yet tell
them merrily.


916
1:5:45,567 --> 1:5:47,68
Send the man away.


917
1:5:47,68 --> 1:5:50,7
Peter, stay at the gate.


918
1:5:50,7 --> 1:5:52,573
Go on.


919
1:5:52,573 --> 1:5:54,575
Hast thou met
with him?


920
1:5:54,575 --> 1:5:56,76
Oh, I am aweary.


921
1:5:56,76 --> 1:5:57,577
Give me leave awhile.


922
1:5:57,577 --> 1:5:59,579
Fie, how my bones ache!


923
1:5:59,579 --> 1:6:3,434
Ooh!


924
1:6:3,434 --> 1:6:6,937
Sweet, sweet...


925
1:6:6,937 --> 1:6:8,939
Sweet nurse.


926
1:6:8,939 --> 1:6:11,441
Tell me, what says my love?


927
1:6:11,441 --> 1:6:13,442
Ha ha ha!


928
1:6:13,442 --> 1:6:17,446
Your love says like
an honest gentleman,


929
1:6:17,446 --> 1:6:22,45
and courteous,
and kind,


930
1:6:22,45 --> 1:6:25,453
and handsome,
and, I warrant him,


931
1:6:25,453 --> 1:6:27,455
a virtuous--


932
1:6:27,455 --> 1:6:28,956
Where is your mother?


933
1:6:28,956 --> 1:6:30,457
Where is my mother?


934
1:6:30,457 --> 1:6:31,959
Why, she is within.


935
1:6:31,959 --> 1:6:33,46
Where should she be?


936
1:6:33,46 --> 1:6:34,962
How oddly thou repliest!


937
1:6:34,962 --> 1:6:37,463
"Your love says like
an honest gentleman,


938
1:6:37,463 --> 1:6:38,464
where is your mother?"


939
1:6:38,464 --> 1:6:40,967
Oh, God's lady,
are you so hot?


940
1:6:40,967 --> 1:6:42,468
Marry, come up I trow.


941
1:6:42,468 --> 1:6:44,97
Is this the poultice
for my aching bones?


942
1:6:44,97 --> 1:6:46,471
Henceforward do
your messages yourself.


943
1:6:46,471 --> 1:6:47,973
Here's such a coil!


944
1:6:47,973 --> 1:6:53,978
Come! What says Romeo?


945
1:6:53,978 --> 1:6:57,481
Have you got leave
to go to shrift today?


946
1:6:57,481 --> 1:7:0,483
I have.


947
1:7:0,483 --> 1:7:3,987
Then, hie you hence
to Friar Laurence's cell,


948
1:7:3,987 --> 1:7:8,49
there stays a husband
to make you a wife.


949
1:7:8,49 --> 1:7:11,16
Ha ha ha!


950
1:7:11,16 --> 1:7:15,496
Now comes the wanton blood
up in your cheeks.


951
1:7:15,496 --> 1:7:20,168
They'll be in scarlet
straight at any news.


952
1:7:20,168 --> 1:7:22,2
Hie you to church!


953
1:7:22,2 --> 1:7:24,171
I'll to dinner.


954
1:7:24,171 --> 1:7:27,4
Honest nurse, farewell!


955
1:7:27,4 --> 1:7:37,16
Ha ha ha!


956
1:7:37,16 --> 1:7:40,18
So smile the heavens
upon this holy act,


957
1:7:40,18 --> 1:7:43,21
that after-hours with sorrow
chide us not.


958
1:7:43,21 --> 1:7:46,23
Amen, amen.


959
1:7:46,23 --> 1:7:47,524
Come what sorrow can,


960
1:7:47,524 --> 1:7:50,27
it cannot countervail
the exchange of joy


961
1:7:50,27 --> 1:7:53,29
that one short minute
gives me in her sight.


962
1:7:53,29 --> 1:7:55,31
These violent delights
have violent ends,


963
1:7:55,31 --> 1:7:56,532
and in
their triumph die,


964
1:7:56,532 --> 1:7:58,34
like fire and powder,


965
1:7:58,34 --> 1:7:59,969
which as
they kiss consume.


966
1:7:59,969 --> 1:8:1,97
The sweetest honey
is loathsome


967
1:8:1,97 --> 1:8:3,472
in its own...


968
1:8:3,472 --> 1:8:4,973
Deliciousness.


969
1:8:4,973 --> 1:8:6,475
Deliciousness.


970
1:8:6,475 --> 1:8:8,476
And in the taste
confounds the...


971
1:8:8,476 --> 1:8:9,81
Appetite.


972
1:8:9,81 --> 1:8:11,111
Appetite.


973
1:8:11,111 --> 1:8:14,982
Therefore
love moderately...


974
1:8:14,982 --> 1:8:17,484
Long love doth so.


975
1:8:17,484 --> 1:8:20,42
Ah, here comes
the lady.


976
1:8:20,42 --> 1:8:23,589
O, so light a foot will ne'er
wear out the everlasting flint.


977
1:8:23,589 --> 1:8:29,995
Juliet!


978
1:8:29,995 --> 1:8:32,497
Good even to
my ghostly confessor.


979
1:8:32,497 --> 1:8:36,0
Romeo shall thank thee,
daughter, for us both.


980
1:8:36,0 --> 1:8:37,502
Ah, Juliet,


981
1:8:37,502 --> 1:8:40,737
if the measure of thy joy
be heaped like mine,


982
1:8:40,737 --> 1:8:43,507
that thy skill be
more to blazon it,


983
1:8:43,507 --> 1:8:45,8
then sweeten
with thy breath


984
1:8:45,8 --> 1:8:46,509
this neighbor air.


985
1:8:46,509 --> 1:8:49,512
They are but beggars
that can count their worth.


986
1:8:49,512 --> 1:8:52,948
But my true love is
grown to such excess,


987
1:8:52,948 --> 1:8:55,517
I cannot sum up
sum of half my wealth.


988
1:8:55,517 --> 1:8:57,18
Tsk tsk tsk!


989
1:8:57,18 --> 1:8:59,687
Come, come with me...


990
1:8:59,687 --> 1:9:1,622
We will make short work.


991
1:9:1,622 --> 1:9:3,123
For, by your leaves,


992
1:9:3,123 --> 1:9:5,125
you shall not
stay alone


993
1:9:5,125 --> 1:11:5,125
till holy church
incorporate two in one.
