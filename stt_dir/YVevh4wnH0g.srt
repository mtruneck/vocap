<i> Narrator: On this
 episode of Wicked Tuna.</i>


2
0:0:13,179 --> 0:0:14,48
Kevin: There's no way
Dave's gonna beat me


3
0:0:14,48 --> 0:0:15,948
on my last week out.


4
0:0:15,948 --> 0:0:18,284
Either he moves or
he gets run over.


5
0:0:18,284 --> 0:0:19,718
Dave: Stay the (bleep) away.


6
0:0:19,718 --> 0:0:21,22
Marciano: I promised
my son I'd get him out


7
0:0:21,22 --> 0:0:22,988
in the boat one
day this week.


8
0:0:22,988 --> 0:0:24,557
Reel, Joe, reel!


9
0:0:24,557 --> 0:0:25,958
Greg: It's not
going good today.


10
0:0:25,958 --> 0:0:26,992
Kevin: Hold the hook.


11
0:0:26,992 --> 0:0:30,96
This is the worst day
in my fishing career.


12
0:0:30,96 --> 0:0:33,299
Dave: How's that
feel, Kevin?


13
0:0:33,299 --> 0:0:34,9
<i> Narrator: Fishing
 is a hard life.</i>


14
0:0:34,9 --> 0:0:36,335
Ralph: There's gonna
be confrontation.


15
0:0:36,335 --> 0:0:38,537
<i> Narrator: And harder with
 Bluefin stocks depleted.</i>


16
0:0:38,537 --> 0:0:40,39
<i> In Gloucester,
 Massachusetts,</i>


17
0:0:40,39 --> 0:0:42,208
<i> there's a special
 breed of fisherman.</i>


18
0:0:42,208 --> 0:0:44,743
<i> For generations, they've
 used rod and reel to catch</i>


19
0:0:44,743 --> 0:0:46,579
<i> the elusive Bluefin Tuna.</i>


20
0:0:46,579 --> 0:0:47,713
Jay: Yeah, baby!


21
0:0:47,713 --> 0:0:49,148
<i> Narrator: They
 depend on these fish</i>


22
0:0:49,148 --> 0:0:50,82
<i> for their survival.</i>


23
0:0:50,82 --> 0:0:51,283
<i> The competition is brutal.</i>


24
0:0:51,283 --> 0:0:52,685
Scott: You
miserable (bleep).


25
0:0:52,685 --> 0:1:0,392
<i> Narrator: This
 is Wicked Tuna.</i>


26
0:1:0,392 --> 0:1:2,528
Dave: Go, go!


27
0:1:2,528 --> 0:1:4,396
It's great to be on top,
it's great to make all the


28
0:1:4,396 --> 0:1:7,166
money; but with that,
nobody likes a winner.


29
0:1:7,166 --> 0:1:9,435
Marciano: For me, the money
doesn't fall out of the sky;


30
0:1:9,435 --> 0:1:11,504
it comes out of the sea.


31
0:1:11,504 --> 0:1:12,771
Bill: This gets harder
as you get older,


32
0:1:12,771 --> 0:1:14,306
but I'm keeping up
with the young guns.


33
0:1:14,306 --> 0:1:15,407
Get out of the way.


34
0:1:15,407 --> 0:1:16,742
Ralph: If it's on my
mind you're gonna hear


35
0:1:16,742 --> 0:1:18,11
about it and if you
did something to me,


36
0:1:18,11 --> 0:1:43,469
I'm gonna do
something back to you.


37
0:1:43,469 --> 0:1:44,37
Dave: Come on, man.


38
0:1:44,37 --> 0:1:47,673
We better (bleep)
see fish here today.


39
0:1:47,673 --> 0:1:48,874
Sandro: You look
funny doing that.


40
0:1:48,874 --> 0:1:50,576
Dave: I do, I feel
funny doing this.


41
0:1:50,576 --> 0:1:52,44
Week's coming to a
close here and we still


42
0:1:52,44 --> 0:1:55,47
haven't caught a fish
bigger than Kevin's.


43
0:1:55,47 --> 0:1:56,448
Kevin: Dave's been
on top for a while.


44
0:1:56,448 --> 0:1:58,384
It's definitely
all gonna change,


45
0:1:58,384 --> 0:2:0,986
there's only room for one
number one in this group.


46
0:2:0,986 --> 0:2:3,489
Scott: This is a monster.


47
0:2:3,489 --> 0:2:5,24
Kevin: Whoo!


48
0:2:5,24 --> 0:2:8,6
Look at that, boy!


49
0:2:8,6 --> 0:2:9,528
Rick: That is the
biggest fish that we've


50
0:2:9,528 --> 0:2:12,731
seen all year, it's a
thousand pound fish.


51
0:2:12,731 --> 0:2:14,433
Kevin: Size
matters, Davy boy.


52
0:2:14,433 --> 0:2:15,701
Dave: I want the
(bleep) biggest one


53
0:2:15,701 --> 0:2:17,937
in the fleet this year.


54
0:2:17,937 --> 0:2:20,272
Rumor has is this is
Kevin's last week fishing


55
0:2:20,272 --> 0:2:22,107
and he's heading back
to work and this is


56
0:2:22,107 --> 0:2:31,25
my last week to try
and beat his fish.


57
0:2:31,25 --> 0:2:34,19
Today, I have one goal,
and one goal only,


58
0:2:34,19 --> 0:2:36,355
and that's to catch a
thousand pound tuna.


59
0:2:36,355 --> 0:2:38,224
I know I'm never gonna hear
the end of Kevin's fish,


60
0:2:38,224 --> 0:2:39,592
even if he didn't
catch another fish,


61
0:2:39,592 --> 0:2:41,694
he'll find some way
to stick it to me,


62
0:2:41,694 --> 0:2:44,863
'cause he got a thousand
seventy five pounder.


63
0:2:44,863 --> 0:2:47,266
Paul: This is Kevin's last
week out here and he still


64
0:2:47,266 --> 0:2:49,935
holds the record for
the biggest fish.


65
0:2:49,935 --> 0:2:52,71
It's absolutely killing
Dave that, that he hasn't


66
0:2:52,71 --> 0:2:54,373
got one to beat him yet.


67
0:2:54,373 --> 0:2:55,708
Dave: I wonder how
many chunks I've cut


68
0:2:55,708 --> 0:2:57,42
in my lifetime?


69
0:2:57,42 --> 0:2:58,344
If I had a nickel for
each one I'd probably


70
0:2:58,344 --> 0:3:4,283
be a millionaire.


71
0:3:4,283 --> 0:3:5,884
Kevin: Hey, a
double rainbow.


72
0:3:5,884 --> 0:3:11,23
Must be close to
Dot-Com right there.


73
0:3:11,23 --> 0:3:13,25
Paul: Back the (bleep) up.


74
0:3:13,25 --> 0:3:15,94
What is he doing?


75
0:3:15,94 --> 0:3:16,595
Dave: (Bleep) go,
get out of here.


76
0:3:16,595 --> 0:3:17,83
Kevin anchored
right on top of us.


77
0:3:17,83 --> 0:3:19,999
Yeah, and it's been
the norm this year.


78
0:3:19,999 --> 0:3:21,467
If Kevin's so good,
why does he need to be


79
0:3:21,467 --> 0:3:22,568
following me
around, you know?


80
0:3:22,568 --> 0:3:23,535
Go find your own spot.


81
0:3:23,535 --> 0:3:24,637
You don't have to be
right on top of me,


82
0:3:24,637 --> 0:3:25,638
he knows better.


83
0:3:25,638 --> 0:3:27,973
Paul: It makes him
go out of his mind.


84
0:3:27,973 --> 0:3:31,81
To him it's like
a big (bleep) you!


85
0:3:31,81 --> 0:3:33,479
And (bleep) you,
and (bleep) you,


86
0:3:33,479 --> 0:3:40,719
and (bleep) you!


87
0:3:40,719 --> 0:3:42,154
Greg: When we see Dot-Com
with a girlfriend,


88
0:3:42,154 --> 0:3:43,822
what's the, where's the
first place we look?


89
0:3:43,822 --> 0:3:56,769
Kevin: The first thing we
look for is an Adam's apple.


90
0:3:56,769 --> 0:4:0,239
Oh, Dave.


91
0:4:0,239 --> 0:4:3,108
Nothing gets me more
excited than to anchor up


92
0:4:3,108 --> 0:4:7,79
next to Dave, 'cause
it drives him nuts.


93
0:4:7,79 --> 0:4:9,548
So I go out of my way to
torture him a little bit.


94
0:4:9,548 --> 0:4:10,883
It's just a
little reminder,


95
0:4:10,883 --> 0:4:12,184
we caught a
thousand pounder.


96
0:4:12,184 --> 0:4:15,2
Biggest fish of the
season, but it's not over,


97
0:4:15,2 --> 0:4:20,25
we're here to do it again.


98
0:4:20,25 --> 0:4:21,627
Dave: Kevin did catch
his thousand pounder


99
0:4:21,627 --> 0:4:23,95
and there's nothing more
I want right not than to


100
0:4:23,95 --> 0:4:24,63
beat his ass.


101
0:4:24,63 --> 0:4:26,498
Took him 27
years to get it,


102
0:4:26,498 --> 0:4:28,2
took me my first
trip out to catch


103
0:4:28,2 --> 0:4:31,303
a thousand-pounder
and Sandro, caught his


104
0:4:31,303 --> 0:4:32,938
first fish was over
eleven hundred.


105
0:4:32,938 --> 0:4:34,573
That's a big, big fish.


106
0:4:34,573 --> 0:4:39,678
Kevin's was 118, very
respectable, good for him.


107
0:4:39,678 --> 0:4:41,146
But Sandro's was better.


108
0:4:41,146 --> 0:4:43,315
Paul: Here we
(bleep) go again.


109
0:4:43,315 --> 0:4:46,685
Dave is always have to
have the upper hand,


110
0:4:46,685 --> 0:4:49,121
or it'll eat him.


111
0:4:49,121 --> 0:4:50,923
Alls he wants to
do is (bleep) win,


112
0:4:50,923 --> 0:5:7,373
that's all he cares about.


113
0:5:7,373 --> 0:5:9,441
Nancy: All right big gull,
let's move that ball.


114
0:5:9,441 --> 0:5:10,509
Marciano: Hey.


115
0:5:10,509 --> 0:5:11,643
All right, here we are.


116
0:5:11,643 --> 0:5:14,246
I finally get an opportunity
to go to of my son,


117
0:5:14,246 --> 0:5:16,815
Joe's football games.


118
0:5:16,815 --> 0:5:18,65
Be great today,
see the family.


119
0:5:18,65 --> 0:5:21,62
You do those little things
that I often miss out on,


120
0:5:21,62 --> 0:5:23,622
'cause I spent so
much time in the boat.


121
0:5:23,622 --> 0:5:27,493
Woman: Go, set it up!


122
0:5:27,493 --> 0:5:30,295
Marciano: Today is gonna be
about fishing and family.


123
0:5:30,295 --> 0:5:32,664
I promised Joe that I'd
get him out on the boat.


124
0:5:32,664 --> 0:5:35,1
He's been catching
fish since he was eight


125
0:5:35,1 --> 0:5:40,973
or nine years old.


126
0:5:40,973 --> 0:5:43,575
Crowd: Yeah!


127
0:5:43,575 --> 0:5:44,777
Marciano: You going to
come out tuna fishing?


128
0:5:44,777 --> 0:5:46,378
We're starving to
death over here.


129
0:5:46,378 --> 0:5:47,98
Joe: Yeah, I know,
I want to go.


130
0:5:47,98 --> 0:5:49,815
Marciano: Joe has always
been my good luck charm.


131
0:5:49,815 --> 0:5:52,5
I need all the
luck I can get.


132
0:5:52,5 --> 0:5:53,886
Marciano: Eva, did you
have fun at the game?


133
0:5:53,886 --> 0:5:56,88
Eva: I don't know.


134
0:5:56,88 --> 0:6:7,866
Marciano: Let's
get out of here.


135
0:6:7,866 --> 0:6:10,202
Ralph: Give me that
red funnel here.


136
0:6:10,202 --> 0:6:11,937
All right, open
that gear oil here.


137
0:6:11,937 --> 0:6:15,674
You're gonna pour it in
a little, monitor it.


138
0:6:15,674 --> 0:6:18,1
We're doing some maintenance
on the boat today because I


139
0:6:18,1 --> 0:6:19,378
don't want to be tied-up
with a breakdown.


140
0:6:19,378 --> 0:6:21,13
You don't want to get stuck
on a rough night coming in


141
0:6:21,13 --> 0:6:22,981
with a fish and you can't
get back out the next day,


142
0:6:22,981 --> 0:6:25,117
so it's time to look
over all your stuff and


143
0:6:25,117 --> 0:6:26,218
catch up on the
maintenance.


144
0:6:26,218 --> 0:6:29,354
Get some fresh oil in,
tighten up your belts,


145
0:6:29,354 --> 0:6:30,355
clean the bilge.


146
0:6:30,355 --> 0:6:31,723
Pirate: I'm changing
the oil over from a,


147
0:6:31,723 --> 0:6:34,893
a bigger jug to
smaller jugs.


148
0:6:34,893 --> 0:6:36,695
These are reserve,
reserve jugs in case


149
0:6:36,695 --> 0:6:38,363
we do need some oil.


150
0:6:38,363 --> 0:6:40,666
So she burns a little
bit once in a while, so,


151
0:6:40,666 --> 0:6:43,802
it's nicer to have smaller
jugs of oil on deck than


152
0:6:43,802 --> 0:6:45,838
having this big pail.


153
0:6:45,838 --> 0:6:48,54
Ralph: In this business you
can't be concerned about


154
0:6:48,54 --> 0:6:50,776
who's catching what, and
who's getting paid what.


155
0:6:50,776 --> 0:6:53,812
You got to go out there
every day and fish hard,


156
0:6:53,812 --> 0:6:55,714
you know, good days,
bad days, good weather,


157
0:6:55,714 --> 0:6:56,849
bad weather.


158
0:6:56,849 --> 0:6:58,684
You got to focus on what's
going on in your boat,


159
0:6:58,684 --> 0:7:1,92
not what's going on with
everybody else's boat.


160
0:7:1,92 --> 0:7:3,522
While the
competition is there,


161
0:7:3,522 --> 0:7:5,824
you got to kind of ignore it
and you got to do the best


162
0:7:5,824 --> 0:7:9,294
you can with your boat every
day, day in, and day out.


163
0:7:9,294 --> 0:7:10,529
Now we just
checked the oil,


164
0:7:10,529 --> 0:7:11,763
tightened-up the
steering belt,


165
0:7:11,763 --> 0:7:14,466
and checked all the other
vital signs for safety.


166
0:7:14,466 --> 0:7:16,502
Everything appears
to be in good shape.


167
0:7:16,502 --> 0:7:18,203
Ready to go out to
sea, in pursuit of the


168
0:7:18,203 --> 0:7:19,938
giant bluefin today.


169
0:7:19,938 --> 0:7:22,207
Basically, for me is,
I get up every day


170
0:7:22,207 --> 0:7:25,43
and go fishing,
and fish hard.


171
0:7:25,43 --> 0:7:29,882
And, as a result, I always
put my season together.


172
0:7:29,882 --> 0:7:34,786
Evelise: Good luck,
sweetie, good luck.


173
0:7:34,786 --> 0:7:40,25
Bye-bye, you be careful.


174
0:7:40,25 --> 0:7:42,227
Ralph: We're going to go
inside Cape Cod Bay into the


175
0:7:42,227 --> 0:7:44,263
shallow water where the
lobster fisherman have been


176
0:7:44,263 --> 0:7:47,332
reporting seeing some big
tuna jumping in and around


177
0:7:47,332 --> 0:7:50,2
the mackerel that are
inside there stacked up.


178
0:7:50,2 --> 0:7:52,671
Hopefully we can
bend the rod today.


179
0:7:52,671 --> 0:8:5,584
Here we go.


180
0:8:5,584 --> 0:8:6,885
Paul: There he comes.


181
0:8:6,885 --> 0:8:11,123
Dave: 90 feet, oh, wow,
that's a jumbo, boys.


182
0:8:11,123 --> 0:8:11,957
That's a jumbo.


183
0:8:11,957 --> 0:8:13,625
We're on the clip
Sandro right?


184
0:8:13,625 --> 0:8:14,626
Sandro: Yep.


185
0:8:14,626 --> 0:8:15,794
Dave: Okay.


186
0:8:15,794 --> 0:8:18,163
Sandro: It's time we go out
and teach Kevin a lesson.


187
0:8:18,163 --> 0:8:22,367
You don't (bleep)
with Tuna.com.


188
0:8:22,367 --> 0:8:23,802
Dave: Pretty excited.


189
0:8:23,802 --> 0:8:25,47
Paul: Yeah, there's a
lot of (bleep) under the


190
0:8:25,47 --> 0:8:26,505
boat right now, dude.


191
0:8:26,505 --> 0:8:29,508
Dave's obsessed
with beating Kevin.


192
0:8:29,508 --> 0:8:32,911
He's got a great
catch, so move on.


193
0:8:32,911 --> 0:8:35,18
(Bleep) it.


194
0:8:35,18 --> 0:8:36,248
Sandro: 100.


195
0:8:36,248 --> 0:8:37,15
Dave: How deep?


196
0:8:37,15 --> 0:8:37,983
Sandro: Hundred.


197
0:8:37,983 --> 0:8:39,751
Paul: I'm cutting
some bait here.


198
0:8:39,751 --> 0:8:41,286
Pretty soon I'm going
to start throwing the


199
0:8:41,286 --> 0:8:45,19
bait out far to get it
deep in, up high,


200
0:8:45,19 --> 0:8:47,459
so they go up and down.


201
0:8:47,459 --> 0:8:50,28
You don't want the fish
to swim in one pattern,


202
0:8:50,28 --> 0:8:52,497
you want 'em to scatter up
and down, and all around.


203
0:8:52,497 --> 0:8:53,699
Sandro: They get crazy.


204
0:8:53,699 --> 0:8:54,566
Paul: Right.


205
0:8:54,566 --> 0:8:55,634
Dave: Making 'em crazy.


206
0:8:55,634 --> 0:8:58,77
Paul: You want
to horn 'em up.


207
0:8:58,77 --> 0:9:1,873
Get 'em all frenzying.


208
0:9:1,873 --> 0:9:3,108
Sandro: I got 90.


209
0:9:3,108 --> 0:9:4,343
Dave: Back at 90?


210
0:9:4,343 --> 0:9:5,911
Paul: Yeah, that
seems to be their


211
0:9:5,911 --> 0:9:7,279
depth right now, huh?


212
0:9:7,279 --> 0:9:8,48
Dave: Oh, yeah.


213
0:9:8,48 --> 0:9:10,215
Sandro: All the
way up to 70.


214
0:9:10,215 --> 0:9:11,35
Paul: All the way to 70.


215
0:9:11,35 --> 0:9:12,15
Dave: He's right here.


216
0:9:12,15 --> 0:9:13,885
Paul: Oh, he's a
big bitch, dude.


217
0:9:13,885 --> 0:9:14,987
Sandro: A big bitch.


218
0:9:14,987 --> 0:9:16,521
Dave: Whoa, that's
a mambo, dude.


219
0:9:16,521 --> 0:9:19,591
Paul: His sole purpose was
just to get a bigger fish.


220
0:9:19,591 --> 0:9:21,193
He's fit to be tied.


221
0:9:21,193 --> 0:9:23,762
At this point, I just
want to catch a fish.


222
0:9:23,762 --> 0:9:27,32
I just want to make
some (bleep) money.


223
0:9:27,32 --> 0:9:31,903
There he comes.


224
0:9:31,903 --> 0:9:38,944
Sandro: Here he is,
we're on, we're on!


225
0:9:38,944 --> 0:9:41,446
Dave: Forward, forward!


226
0:9:41,446 --> 0:9:42,648
Paul: Whoo!


227
0:9:42,648 --> 0:9:46,451
Bury that hook
in him, bury it!


228
0:9:46,451 --> 0:9:48,687
Bury that (bleep) hook!


229
0:9:48,687 --> 0:9:50,122
Dave: Wait, slow down,
slow down, slow down!


230
0:9:50,122 --> 0:9:51,223
Forward, forward!


231
0:9:51,223 --> 0:9:52,791
Paul: Right now, we got
one on the line and we


232
0:9:52,791 --> 0:9:53,959
thing it could be
bigger than Kevin's.


233
0:9:53,959 --> 0:9:55,694
Reel, bitch!


234
0:9:55,694 --> 0:10:5,17
Dave: Yeah.


235
0:10:5,17 --> 0:10:6,505
Dave: A lot of money
on the line and


236
0:10:6,505 --> 0:10:10,676
no screwing up
here, no mistakes.


237
0:10:10,676 --> 0:10:12,177
Look at that (bleep)
phone ringing.


238
0:10:12,177 --> 0:10:14,646
Can you (bleep) believe it?


239
0:10:14,646 --> 0:10:16,682
Paul: Dr. Barry's calling,
he wants to know if


240
0:10:16,682 --> 0:10:19,284
you want more Viagra.


241
0:10:19,284 --> 0:10:21,787
Dave: Yeah.


242
0:10:21,787 --> 0:10:25,924
Paul: Send 'em over and
(bleep) blow 'em up!


243
0:10:25,924 --> 0:10:27,492
Dave: There she goes!


244
0:10:27,492 --> 0:10:28,326
Paul: Yeah!


245
0:10:28,326 --> 0:10:34,633
We need the
Viagra, we're old.


246
0:10:34,633 --> 0:10:36,1
Dave: All right, come
on, come on, come on!


247
0:10:36,1 --> 0:10:40,572
I don't want to
turn him, easy.


248
0:10:40,572 --> 0:10:42,641
Hundred feet.


249
0:10:42,641 --> 0:10:46,978
He's a big boy.


250
0:10:46,978 --> 0:10:48,313
I want to stay right
on top of him so


251
0:10:48,313 --> 0:10:49,481
we know where he's at.


252
0:10:49,481 --> 0:10:50,782
Paul: I'm getting
the harpoon ready.


253
0:10:50,782 --> 0:10:52,551
I got one on each
side of the boat.


254
0:10:52,551 --> 0:10:54,319
The bigger size fish
you gotta have a


255
0:10:54,319 --> 0:10:55,821
harpoon on each side.


256
0:10:55,821 --> 0:10:57,689
You know?


257
0:10:57,689 --> 0:11:1,893
You got to have them ready.


258
0:11:1,893 --> 0:11:4,629
Dave: Slow it down.


259
0:11:4,629 --> 0:11:13,605
I'm going to see swivel
here in a second, swivel.


260
0:11:13,605 --> 0:11:17,75
Paul: Got one!


261
0:11:17,75 --> 0:11:19,711
Nailed him right
in the back.


262
0:11:19,711 --> 0:11:21,12
We see him,
we were psyched.


263
0:11:21,12 --> 0:11:23,982
It was a big
fish, he was big.


264
0:11:23,982 --> 0:11:25,55
It would be sweet
revenge to know we


265
0:11:25,55 --> 0:11:27,119
got one bigger
than Kevin.


266
0:11:27,119 --> 0:11:31,923
Go ahead Dave.


267
0:11:31,923 --> 0:11:34,626
Dave: Pretty excited, we
know we got a big fish.


268
0:11:34,626 --> 0:11:37,295
But, yeah, we don't know
if we got Kevin beat.


269
0:11:37,295 --> 0:11:42,567
Paul: Keep going, keep
going, keep going.


270
0:11:42,567 --> 0:11:43,602
Dave: No way.


271
0:11:43,602 --> 0:11:44,836
Paul: Keep going, right
there, right there,


272
0:11:44,836 --> 0:11:45,704
right there.


273
0:11:45,704 --> 0:11:46,671
Dave: No way.


274
0:11:46,671 --> 0:11:48,39
Paul: Yep.


275
0:11:48,39 --> 0:11:50,408
Dave: That's a lo-, holy
(bleep), he's (bleep) long.


276
0:11:50,408 --> 0:11:51,81
Paul: 12 feet, I told you.


277
0:11:51,81 --> 0:11:53,78
Dave: No (bleep) way.


278
0:11:53,78 --> 0:11:55,18
I knew, you know, when
that fish came up,


279
0:11:55,18 --> 0:11:56,615
we definitely
had a big boy on.


280
0:11:56,615 --> 0:11:58,617
It was definitely
a grander.


281
0:11:58,617 --> 0:12:2,2
Look out, Kevin,
I'm taking you down.


282
0:12:2,2 --> 0:12:3,989
Another (bleep) grander
right here, boys.


283
0:12:3,989 --> 0:12:5,23
Look at the size
of that tail.


284
0:12:5,23 --> 0:12:6,792
Paul: Oh, Dave
was so pumped.


285
0:12:6,792 --> 0:12:11,396
They could say, oh, he
was like a little kid.


286
0:12:11,396 --> 0:12:12,731
Oh, measure him.


287
0:12:12,731 --> 0:12:15,4
What's his girth, and yeah.


288
0:12:15,4 --> 0:12:17,369
Dave: Cha-ching,
that's all I gotta say.


289
0:12:17,369 --> 0:12:20,405
That's what it's all about
right there, (bleep) boys.


290
0:12:20,405 --> 0:12:27,646
That's tuna
fishing, amazing.


291
0:12:27,646 --> 0:12:29,848
Paul: So (bleep)
you, Kevin.


292
0:12:29,848 --> 0:12:31,95
Dave: Hey Kevin,
you there?


293
0:12:31,95 --> 0:12:33,418
Yeah, you should've
been here.


294
0:12:33,418 --> 0:12:37,155
It's definitely over
a thousand pounds.


295
0:12:37,155 --> 0:12:38,59
You there?


296
0:12:38,59 --> 0:12:41,226
Kevin: That's great,
congrats, man.


297
0:12:41,226 --> 0:12:43,94
Dave: She's definitely
a contender, Kevin.


298
0:12:43,94 --> 0:12:44,362
Kevin: So you
heading back?


299
0:12:44,362 --> 0:12:45,43
Dave: Hell, no.


300
0:12:45,43 --> 0:12:46,631
We're gonna stay out here
'til the bait's gone.


301
0:12:46,631 --> 0:12:47,866
We're gonna catch
another one.


302
0:12:47,866 --> 0:12:49,134
Kevin: I can't
believe Dave caught a


303
0:12:49,134 --> 0:12:58,21
thousand pounder,
unfreaking real.


304
0:12:58,21 --> 0:13:0,579
Marciano: I got my son
Joseph here with us today.


305
0:13:0,579 --> 0:13:2,781
He's famous for getting us
the hooked baits that catch


306
0:13:2,781 --> 0:13:4,349
the fish, you know?


307
0:13:4,349 --> 0:13:6,151
He's done that a
bunch of times for us.


308
0:13:6,151 --> 0:13:8,119
Joe: I've been fishing
since I was like


309
0:13:8,119 --> 0:13:9,521
probably four years old.


310
0:13:9,521 --> 0:13:10,322
Marciano: Hey, Joe.


311
0:13:10,322 --> 0:13:11,556
Joe: Yeah?


312
0:13:11,556 --> 0:13:12,724
Marciano: Just so you know,
you can catch my live bait


313
0:13:12,724 --> 0:13:14,125
any time here, you know?


314
0:13:14,125 --> 0:13:15,427
I'm ready, kinda.


315
0:13:15,427 --> 0:13:16,862
Joe: Yeah, I'm
working on it.


316
0:13:16,862 --> 0:13:18,63
Marciano: You're
just waiting for the


317
0:13:18,63 --> 0:13:18,964
right one, right?


318
0:13:18,964 --> 0:13:20,165
Joe: Right, right.


319
0:13:20,165 --> 0:13:21,366
Marciano: All right.


320
0:13:21,366 --> 0:13:23,168
Joe: I've thought about
following in his footsteps,


321
0:13:23,168 --> 0:13:24,436
but the main thing,
I have to get, uh,


322
0:13:24,436 --> 0:13:25,503
through college first.


323
0:13:25,503 --> 0:13:26,938
And he's even told me that.


324
0:13:26,938 --> 0:13:28,807
Marciano: It's important
that Joe go to college.


325
0:13:28,807 --> 0:13:31,376
You know, I want him to have
the opportunities, you know,


326
0:13:31,376 --> 0:13:32,711
that I didn't have.


327
0:13:32,711 --> 0:13:35,447
Especially this day and
age, the way things are,


328
0:13:35,447 --> 0:13:37,215
you really don't have
a shot if you don't


329
0:13:37,215 --> 0:13:38,984
have that college diploma.


330
0:13:38,984 --> 0:13:41,853
For me, that's one
mistake I don't want my


331
0:13:41,853 --> 0:13:45,557
children to make.


332
0:13:45,557 --> 0:13:48,894
There's a fish, fish
are ready here, folks.


333
0:13:48,894 --> 0:13:50,528
Fish are ready at five.


334
0:13:50,528 --> 0:13:51,496
Jason: At five?


335
0:13:51,496 --> 0:13:52,931
Marciano: Joe, keep
trying right away.


336
0:13:52,931 --> 0:13:53,999
Joe: Gonna try.


337
0:13:53,999 --> 0:13:55,2
Marciano: See is you
can get us a live here.


338
0:13:55,2 --> 0:13:56,234
Joe: Any minute now.


339
0:13:56,234 --> 0:13:58,236
Marciano: There
he is again at 15.


340
0:13:58,236 --> 0:13:59,938
Just keep at it, Joe, yeah.


341
0:13:59,938 --> 0:14:4,42
See if we can get our
thousand pounder.


342
0:14:4,42 --> 0:14:8,313
Two of 'em, two of
'em on the screen.


343
0:14:8,313 --> 0:14:10,415
Three of 'em, big fish.


344
0:14:10,415 --> 0:14:11,516
Jay: How high?


345
0:14:11,516 --> 0:14:14,352
Marciano: They're coming
up as high as 10 and 11.


346
0:14:14,352 --> 0:14:17,355
We got 'em in the chum.


347
0:14:17,355 --> 0:14:18,79
They're here,
they're up in 10.


348
0:14:18,79 --> 0:14:20,91
Joe, crank that
up this time.


349
0:14:20,91 --> 0:14:21,226
We got 'em high.


350
0:14:21,226 --> 0:14:22,861
If that
rod goes,


351
0:14:22,861 --> 0:14:25,43
we're gonna get a big
fish out of the deal.


352
0:14:25,43 --> 0:14:27,32
How high up do
they come, Joe?


353
0:14:27,32 --> 0:14:28,133
Joe: 18.


354
0:14:28,133 --> 0:14:29,668
Marciano: We haven't got
a thousand pounder yet,


355
0:14:29,668 --> 0:14:33,972
but we're gonna
get one today.


356
0:14:33,972 --> 0:14:38,109
Any minute now.


357
0:14:38,109 --> 0:14:39,811
Pirate: Ready, Cap?


358
0:14:39,811 --> 0:14:44,115
Ralph: Let her fly.


359
0:14:44,115 --> 0:14:46,151
No sooner did we get tight
on the anchor that the


360
0:14:46,151 --> 0:14:47,852
machine started beeping,
we started marking


361
0:14:47,852 --> 0:14:49,788
giant tunas right away.


362
0:14:49,788 --> 0:14:51,89
Pirate: Oh, you
better be kidding me.


363
0:14:51,89 --> 0:14:53,391
Already?


364
0:14:53,391 --> 0:14:54,559
Ralph: Keep the chum going.


365
0:14:54,559 --> 0:14:56,661
You got one under the boat
right now at 70 feet.


366
0:14:56,661 --> 0:14:57,762
Pirate: Yeah, if I
could get the birds to


367
0:14:57,762 --> 0:14:59,531
stay away for
five seconds.


368
0:14:59,531 --> 0:15:2,434
Ralph: Pirate expects
respect from the birds.


369
0:15:2,434 --> 0:15:4,302
He expects that they keep
their distance and they


370
0:15:4,302 --> 0:15:7,105
don't eat the chum that
he's throwing in the water.


371
0:15:7,105 --> 0:15:8,94
Most important thing is
that Pirate doesn't get


372
0:15:8,94 --> 0:15:10,942
distracted by the
birds and focus all his


373
0:15:10,942 --> 0:15:12,444
attention on the birds.


374
0:15:12,444 --> 0:15:14,346
He really needs to pay
attention to the bait


375
0:15:14,346 --> 0:15:16,381
getting under the boat
so we can feed the tuna


376
0:15:16,381 --> 0:15:18,16
and catch a fish.


377
0:15:18,16 --> 0:15:20,885
Pirate: See over
there, right?


378
0:15:20,885 --> 0:15:23,254
Ralph: Just over here,
it's gonna go that way.


379
0:15:23,254 --> 0:15:25,223
Look at the three balloons.


380
0:15:25,223 --> 0:15:26,725
Take the angle of
the three bones.


381
0:15:26,725 --> 0:15:28,226
See the angle of
the three balloons?


382
0:15:28,226 --> 0:15:29,627
The angle of three
balloons is actually to


383
0:15:29,627 --> 0:15:31,563
the front of
the boat here.


384
0:15:31,563 --> 0:15:34,165
So, if I was chumming, I
would be standing here and


385
0:15:34,165 --> 0:15:36,634
go, flipping to the
front of the boat.


386
0:15:36,634 --> 0:15:37,736
Pirate: Up a little
further to the bow?


387
0:15:37,736 --> 0:15:39,37
Ralph: You want it,
you want it to go back


388
0:15:39,37 --> 0:15:40,71
even with the balloons.


389
0:15:40,71 --> 0:15:42,54
The balloons are showing
you the drift line.


390
0:15:42,54 --> 0:15:44,275
So your chunk's got
to go in at that front


391
0:15:44,275 --> 0:15:46,311
of the drift line.


392
0:15:46,311 --> 0:15:48,48
If they go over here, the
fish are gonna be over here,


393
0:15:48,48 --> 0:15:50,81
and the bait's
are over here.


394
0:15:50,81 --> 0:15:51,282
Pirate: I asked the
Captain what he,


395
0:15:51,282 --> 0:15:52,517
what's he want me to do?


396
0:15:52,517 --> 0:15:54,85
And now and then he
tells you, say, hey,


397
0:15:54,85 --> 0:15:55,62
guess what we're gonna do?


398
0:15:55,62 --> 0:15:58,69
And you do what
he's gonna say, so.


399
0:15:58,69 --> 0:16:1,926
Well that (bleep) got it.


400
0:16:1,926 --> 0:16:4,95
Ralph: You got to constantly
get out of your chair and


401
0:16:4,95 --> 0:16:6,264
watch the chum go down,
and make sure the chum


402
0:16:6,264 --> 0:16:8,867
is going the way you
think it's going.


403
0:16:8,867 --> 0:16:10,902
Don't take it for granted.


404
0:16:10,902 --> 0:16:13,304
You got to constantly
make adjustments.


405
0:16:13,304 --> 0:16:14,839
It's very important that
your chumming in the right


406
0:16:14,839 --> 0:16:22,8
spot or we're jerking off.


407
0:16:22,8 --> 0:16:23,248
Scott: Coming back.


408
0:16:23,248 --> 0:16:24,49
Kevin: Back?


409
0:16:24,49 --> 0:16:25,5
Scott: Yep.


410
0:16:25,5 --> 0:16:25,984
Kevin: What depth?


411
0:16:25,984 --> 0:16:27,886
Scott: 100, big boy;
that's a slammer.


412
0:16:27,886 --> 0:16:29,487
Kevin: This is the spot,
there's definitely a lot of


413
0:16:29,487 --> 0:16:31,22
fish here; we're
marking a lot.


414
0:16:31,22 --> 0:16:34,159
Dave can catch all the
thousand-pounders he wants;


415
0:16:34,159 --> 0:16:35,76
there's no way this
guy's gonna beat me on


416
0:16:35,76 --> 0:16:39,364
my last week out.


417
0:16:39,364 --> 0:16:41,966
Dave's just off
our port beam here,


418
0:16:41,966 --> 0:16:44,335
maybe a quarter mile.


419
0:16:44,335 --> 0:16:46,104
Dave: Knowing I've
caught a big fish,


420
0:16:46,104 --> 0:16:49,407
and knowing that I could
possibly beat Kevin's fish,


421
0:16:49,407 --> 0:16:51,9
that's a good feeling.


422
0:16:51,9 --> 0:16:53,745
There's something about
having the biggest fish,


423
0:16:53,745 --> 0:16:56,214
size does matter.


424
0:16:56,214 --> 0:16:57,682
Kevin: You know there's a
couple weeks left in the


425
0:16:57,682 --> 0:16:59,651
season, and 1,078.


426
0:16:59,651 --> 0:17:2,153
That's a tough fish
to beat right there.


427
0:17:2,153 --> 0:17:5,156
But, uh, there are some
cruising around here,


428
0:17:5,156 --> 0:17:6,424
no doubt.


429
0:17:6,424 --> 0:17:8,193
I know he's got a big
one on deck today.


430
0:17:8,193 --> 0:17:13,898
I don't think it's
quite that big, but.


431
0:17:13,898 --> 0:17:14,999
They're marking
another one.


432
0:17:14,999 --> 0:17:20,205
It's a big one,
this is a big fish.


433
0:17:20,205 --> 0:17:21,706
Scott: Yeah, we're up!


434
0:17:21,706 --> 0:17:24,843
Kevin: Here we go, yep.


435
0:17:24,843 --> 0:17:28,513
Just stay on it, you okay?


436
0:17:28,513 --> 0:17:29,714
Scott: She's burning.


437
0:17:29,714 --> 0:17:31,216
Sandro: Kevin's tight.


438
0:17:31,216 --> 0:17:32,517
I think Kevin is tight.


439
0:17:32,517 --> 0:17:33,418
Dave: Yeah?


440
0:17:33,418 --> 0:17:34,953
Paul: Oh, he's hooked up.


441
0:17:34,953 --> 0:17:37,889
Dave: Oh, man.


442
0:17:37,889 --> 0:17:39,157
Paul: You know when
it's killing him,


443
0:17:39,157 --> 0:17:43,428
he doesn't say anything.


444
0:17:43,428 --> 0:17:45,73
Kevin: I'm gonna
kick it ahead, Scott.


445
0:17:45,73 --> 0:17:50,268
Paul: If he lands another
(bleep) thousand pound fish,


446
0:17:50,268 --> 0:17:54,139
it could ruin
our whole season.


447
0:17:54,139 --> 0:17:54,839
Kevin: You all right?


448
0:17:54,839 --> 0:17:59,377
That rod's not locked in.


449
0:17:59,377 --> 0:18:2,147
I'm looking and I see
my line kind of headed


450
0:18:2,147 --> 0:18:4,682
towards Dave's boat.


451
0:18:4,682 --> 0:18:6,551
Scott: Heading right
for Dot Com's boat.


452
0:18:6,551 --> 0:18:8,753
Kevin: You might have
to get off, Davy boy.


453
0:18:8,753 --> 0:18:10,188
It's coming right at you.


454
0:18:10,188 --> 0:18:11,422
Dave: We might have
to get off the, uh,


455
0:18:11,422 --> 0:18:13,424
anchor here to get
out of Kevin's way.


456
0:18:13,424 --> 0:18:15,59
It's gonna ruin
our day here.


457
0:18:15,59 --> 0:18:21,432
Why the (bleep) does he
gotta come over here?


458
0:18:21,432 --> 0:18:22,734
Stay the (bleep) away!


459
0:18:22,734 --> 0:18:23,701
Look at him.


460
0:18:23,701 --> 0:18:24,769
Sandro: He's reeling.


461
0:18:24,769 --> 0:18:25,803
Coming in hot.


462
0:18:25,803 --> 0:18:27,772
Dave: Come on Kevin,
(bleep) turn the boat.


463
0:18:27,772 --> 0:18:39,817
Paul: Back the (bleep) up.


464
0:18:39,817 --> 0:18:41,719
Kevin: Don't let that
rod pop out, Scott.


465
0:18:41,719 --> 0:18:44,656
We hooked this big
fish and he took off.


466
0:18:44,656 --> 0:18:46,391
Scott: He's still
taking line.


467
0:18:46,391 --> 0:18:47,792
Kevin: He just
scrammed and he was


468
0:18:47,792 --> 0:18:48,726
pulling the boat around.


469
0:18:48,726 --> 0:18:50,795
Right to my buddy, Dot-Com.


470
0:18:50,795 --> 0:18:51,963
Dave: Stay the
(bleep) away!


471
0:18:51,963 --> 0:18:52,797
Paul: He's reeling.


472
0:18:52,797 --> 0:18:53,531
Dave: Look at him.


473
0:18:53,531 --> 0:18:54,432
Paul: Coming in hot.


474
0:18:54,432 --> 0:18:55,6
Dave: Yeah, if he
gets much closer,


475
0:18:55,6 --> 0:18:56,534
he's gonna take
out our lines.


476
0:18:56,534 --> 0:18:59,3
Come on, Kevin,
(bleep) turn the boat.


477
0:18:59,3 --> 0:19:0,371
Paul: Back the (bleep) up!


478
0:19:0,371 --> 0:19:1,606
Dave: I can't believe this.


479
0:19:1,606 --> 0:19:3,41
Kevin: If he doesn't
want to move,


480
0:19:3,41 --> 0:19:5,109
I'm gonna cut
him off, period.


481
0:19:5,109 --> 0:19:6,44
Dave: What's he,
right off your stern?


482
0:19:6,44 --> 0:19:7,378
Is he up high, or down lee?


483
0:19:7,378 --> 0:19:8,813
Kevin: Probably high.


484
0:19:8,813 --> 0:19:10,982
Dave: (Bleep) right
up high, oh, yeah.


485
0:19:10,982 --> 0:19:12,75
That's the only
way he can beat us,


486
0:19:12,75 --> 0:19:14,85
wiping out our gear.


487
0:19:14,85 --> 0:19:15,587
Kevin: Well it's
spinning ahead.


488
0:19:15,587 --> 0:19:17,555
He ought to be tired, he
took a (bleep) load of line.


489
0:19:17,555 --> 0:19:21,793
Scott: Die already, die!


490
0:19:21,793 --> 0:19:24,562
Kevin: Oh, (bleep)!


491
0:19:24,562 --> 0:19:26,431
(Bleep)!


492
0:19:26,431 --> 0:19:28,233
(Bleep)!


493
0:19:28,233 --> 0:19:29,534
(Bleep)!


494
0:19:29,534 --> 0:19:33,504
You've gotta be (bleep)
kidding me, oh!


495
0:19:33,504 --> 0:19:34,606
We saw him.


496
0:19:34,606 --> 0:19:36,674
We had him about 30 feet
from the boat, and pow.


497
0:19:36,674 --> 0:19:40,144
Pulled the hook,
it hurts, you know?


498
0:19:40,144 --> 0:19:41,879
That was another
big fish, you know?


499
0:19:41,879 --> 0:19:44,515
Eight, 900 pounder,
maybe bigger.


500
0:19:44,515 --> 0:19:48,19
You're talking 20,000
dollars for this fish.


501
0:19:48,19 --> 0:19:51,55
When you lose it, it hurts.


502
0:19:51,55 --> 0:19:52,957
(Bleep) big bastard, too.


503
0:19:52,957 --> 0:19:54,25
Scott: (Bleep) slammer.


504
0:19:54,25 --> 0:19:57,195
Kevin: That thing was big.


505
0:19:57,195 --> 0:20:1,432
Paul: We were laughing
our balls off.


506
0:20:1,432 --> 0:20:2,834
Dave: What happened?


507
0:20:2,834 --> 0:20:6,704
Kevin: Pulled the hook right
at the boat, 20 feet away.


508
0:20:6,704 --> 0:20:8,94
It was worse, it was
worse losing that fish


509
0:20:8,94 --> 0:20:10,341
in front of him, you know?


510
0:20:10,341 --> 0:20:13,144
He's like, "Oh man, I'm
sorry that happened Kev."


511
0:20:13,144 --> 0:20:15,246
Dave: Nah, nothing
you can do, Kev.


512
0:20:15,246 --> 0:20:17,649
Kevin: I don't
believe him, you know?


513
0:20:17,649 --> 0:20:20,585
You know, (bleep) Dave.


514
0:20:20,585 --> 0:20:21,886
Dave: You know, that's
what happens when you


515
0:20:21,886 --> 0:20:23,821
anchor in my spot, you
embarrass yourself and


516
0:20:23,821 --> 0:20:26,391
he had it coming.


517
0:20:26,391 --> 0:20:27,992
Two can play that game.


518
0:20:27,992 --> 0:20:36,401
He (bleep) himself
today, too bad for him.


519
0:20:36,401 --> 0:20:39,57
Ralph: Yeah, baby,
some burgers.


520
0:20:39,57 --> 0:20:41,272
Living large on the Odysea.


521
0:20:41,272 --> 0:20:43,107
One thing we
do, we eat good.


522
0:20:43,107 --> 0:20:45,777
No sandwiches, we eat
burgers and T-bones.


523
0:20:45,777 --> 0:20:48,246
Spending your life
on a 32-foot boat,


524
0:20:48,246 --> 0:20:49,847
it gets to be
difficult at times.


525
0:20:49,847 --> 0:20:52,16
So, depending on
the season, uh,


526
0:20:52,16 --> 0:20:55,119
we always find a way to cook
good food on the Odysea.


527
0:20:55,119 --> 0:20:59,791
If you want to stay out
here, you got to eat good,


528
0:20:59,791 --> 0:21:3,361
wow, that's good.


529
0:21:3,361 --> 0:21:4,462
Yeah, we don't really
care about lunch


530
0:21:4,462 --> 0:21:5,596
when the rod bends.


531
0:21:5,596 --> 0:21:10,501
It's time to get into
action and catch that tuna.


532
0:21:10,501 --> 0:21:13,438
Fish on, fish on, fish on!


533
0:21:13,438 --> 0:21:14,439
Get him!


534
0:21:14,439 --> 0:21:16,974
Pirate lock him up,
Pirate lock him up!


535
0:21:16,974 --> 0:21:19,177
Pirate: Here we go,
we're on the meat!


536
0:21:19,177 --> 0:21:20,611
Ralph: How big is
he, how big is he?


537
0:21:20,611 --> 0:21:22,8
Pirate: I don't know,
he must be a keeper.


538
0:21:22,8 --> 0:21:28,52
He ain't bending the rod
that good, but, good karma!


539
0:21:28,52 --> 0:21:29,821
Good karma, yahoo!


540
0:21:29,821 --> 0:21:31,889
Right now she feels
like a good one.


541
0:21:31,889 --> 0:21:33,558
Probably about
a 400 pounder.


542
0:21:33,558 --> 0:21:34,525
All right, all
right, all right.


543
0:21:34,525 --> 0:21:35,626
That's good, that's
good, that's good.


544
0:21:35,626 --> 0:21:38,396
Hold, hold, easy, easy.


545
0:21:38,396 --> 0:21:39,23
How big?


546
0:21:39,23 --> 0:21:40,164
Ralph: No, it's
not that big.


547
0:21:40,164 --> 0:21:41,265
I got color already.


548
0:21:41,265 --> 0:21:42,433
Might be a short.


549
0:21:42,433 --> 0:21:44,335
Keeper size has
been 73 inches which


550
0:21:44,335 --> 0:21:45,77
is about six feet.


551
0:21:45,77 --> 0:21:47,939
Let's get him up on
the surface again.


552
0:21:47,939 --> 0:21:48,873
Pirate: Here we go.


553
0:21:48,873 --> 0:21:49,907
Oh, that's close.


554
0:21:49,907 --> 0:21:51,509
Ralph: We decided, you
know, rather than not


555
0:21:51,509 --> 0:21:53,411
damage it or stress
it out anymore,


556
0:21:53,411 --> 0:21:55,38
we would just release
it real easily.


557
0:21:55,38 --> 0:21:56,581
Oh, yeah.


558
0:21:56,581 --> 0:21:58,516
Here it goes.


559
0:21:58,516 --> 0:22:0,985
That's the
sustainability factor,


560
0:22:0,985 --> 0:22:2,72
releasing the small ones.


561
0:22:2,72 --> 0:22:4,956
Catching the ones that
have already spawned.


562
0:22:4,956 --> 0:22:7,725
Leaving the young ones
to spawn some day.


563
0:22:7,725 --> 0:22:9,394
Pirate: Hoping the next one
comes up through its gonna


564
0:22:9,394 --> 0:22:18,536
be big enough to stick him.


565
0:22:18,536 --> 0:22:20,138
Joe: Nine, high as nine.


566
0:22:20,138 --> 0:22:22,24
Marciano: See if we
can get 'em to stick.


567
0:22:22,24 --> 0:22:23,307
Joe: Going down.


568
0:22:23,307 --> 0:22:24,876
Marciano: Oh, I love
having him on the boat.


569
0:22:24,876 --> 0:22:28,112
He's usually good luck, so
let's see what happens.


570
0:22:28,112 --> 0:22:28,846
Jason: Where's he at, Joe?


571
0:22:28,846 --> 0:22:29,647
Where's he at?


572
0:22:29,647 --> 0:22:30,415
Marciano: Where's
he hanging, Joe?


573
0:22:30,415 --> 0:22:31,849
Joe: Uh, 20 fathoms.


574
0:22:31,849 --> 0:22:32,617
Marciano: 20?


575
0:22:32,617 --> 0:22:34,786
How high when he comes up?


576
0:22:34,786 --> 0:22:37,822
Joe: Uh, around
like 17 or 15.


577
0:22:37,822 --> 0:22:50,268
Marciano: Okay.


578
0:22:50,268 --> 0:22:51,502
Jason: We're on, we're on!


579
0:22:51,502 --> 0:22:52,637
We're on, Joe!


580
0:22:52,637 --> 0:22:53,671
Marciano: Yeah!


581
0:22:53,671 --> 0:22:54,705
All right, let's get
it in the holder here.


582
0:22:54,705 --> 0:22:56,24
Here we go, ready?


583
0:22:56,24 --> 0:22:57,141
We're on the move.


584
0:22:57,141 --> 0:22:58,109
Joe: Yep.


585
0:22:58,109 --> 0:22:59,177
Marciano: We got a
good one this time.


586
0:22:59,177 --> 0:23:3,448
He's taking a lot of line.


587
0:23:3,448 --> 0:23:4,749
The way this
fish is running,


588
0:23:4,749 --> 0:23:6,517
I'm thinking we
got another 10,000


589
0:23:6,517 --> 0:23:8,753
dollar bill on the line.


590
0:23:8,753 --> 0:23:11,189
Let's go, let's go!


591
0:23:11,189 --> 0:23:12,723
Jason: You get
tired, you tell me.


592
0:23:12,723 --> 0:23:15,226
Marciano: Watching Joe do
this like this reminds me of


593
0:23:15,226 --> 0:23:16,861
when he caught
his first fish.


594
0:23:16,861 --> 0:23:18,629
He was about
nine years old,


595
0:23:18,629 --> 0:23:20,364
the first one he
brought in to himself.


596
0:23:20,364 --> 0:23:21,833
He had caught him with me.


597
0:23:21,833 --> 0:23:24,502
He pulled that fish up in
less than eight minutes.


598
0:23:24,502 --> 0:23:28,606
What could I say, but a
chip off the old block.


599
0:23:28,606 --> 0:23:29,807
All right, Joe,
you're doing good.


600
0:23:29,807 --> 0:23:31,409
Keep that rod bent,
you're doing good,


601
0:23:31,409 --> 0:23:32,643
you're doing good, Son.


602
0:23:32,643 --> 0:23:34,712
Just watch that tip,
you know the drill,


603
0:23:34,712 --> 0:23:40,651
you've done this a
hundred times before.


604
0:23:40,651 --> 0:23:43,488
Jay: Reel, Joe, reel!


605
0:23:43,488 --> 0:23:44,789
Marciano: That's good
Joe, you're doing good.


606
0:23:44,789 --> 0:23:48,693
You're doing good,
keep up the good work.


607
0:23:48,693 --> 0:23:49,494
Doing good, Joe.


608
0:23:49,494 --> 0:23:51,295
Keep it tight,
keep it tight.


609
0:23:51,295 --> 0:23:53,297
Jason: Reel, reel, reel!


610
0:23:53,297 --> 0:24:0,938
There's the fish!


611
0:24:0,938 --> 0:24:3,774
Jay: Reel, Joe, reel!


612
0:24:3,774 --> 0:24:5,142
Marciano: That's good
Joe, you're doing good.


613
0:24:5,142 --> 0:24:9,8
You're doing good,
keep up the good work.


614
0:24:9,8 --> 0:24:10,181
Doing good, Joe.


615
0:24:10,181 --> 0:24:11,549
Keep it tight,
keep it tight.


616
0:24:11,549 --> 0:24:13,184
Jason: Reel, reel, reel!


617
0:24:13,184 --> 0:24:15,353
There's the fish!


618
0:24:15,353 --> 0:24:16,687
Jay: Right there,
right in the head.


619
0:24:16,687 --> 0:24:19,991
Yeah baby!


620
0:24:19,991 --> 0:24:21,659
Marciano: I'm not normally
a sentimental guy


621
0:24:21,659 --> 0:24:24,462
and the huggy feely type;
but I can't describe


622
0:24:24,462 --> 0:24:26,33
you know, the amount
of pride I feel


623
0:24:26,33 --> 0:24:29,267
when I see Joe reel
in a fish like that.


624
0:24:29,267 --> 0:24:31,969
You know, it show's
me I must have done


625
0:24:31,969 --> 0:24:34,705
a little something
right as a parent.


626
0:24:34,705 --> 0:24:35,706
Jay: Yeah Joe,
cinch it down.


627
0:24:35,706 --> 0:24:40,645
Cinch it down,into
the corner, yea.


628
0:24:40,645 --> 0:24:41,779
Yes.


629
0:24:41,779 --> 0:24:42,914
Marciano: Tails
up, baby.


630
0:24:42,914 --> 0:24:43,981
That's how we like em.


631
0:24:43,981 --> 0:24:49,754
Tails up back there.


632
0:24:49,754 --> 0:24:51,622
Okay here we go.


633
0:24:51,622 --> 0:24:53,791
Jason: Oh he is a
big one, wow!


634
0:24:53,791 --> 0:24:54,992
Marciano: Bigger
than I thought.


635
0:24:54,992 --> 0:24:56,861
That's a 900 pound
fish right here.


636
0:24:56,861 --> 0:24:58,863
This guy with his
shape and the color.


637
0:24:58,863 --> 0:25:1,65
I'm liking what I see,
this guy's gotta be


638
0:25:1,65 --> 0:25:8,272
worth $12,000, not a bad
day's pay right here.


639
0:25:8,272 --> 0:25:10,41
Jason: Hey Dave, he's got
something to say to you.


640
0:25:10,41 --> 0:25:11,275
Marciano: What?


641
0:25:11,275 --> 0:25:12,51
Joe: This means I get to skip
school tomorrow, right?


642
0:25:12,51 --> 0:25:13,911
Marciano: Yeah right.


643
0:25:13,911 --> 0:25:15,546
Jason: I'd say yes too.


644
0:25:15,546 --> 0:25:22,52
Come on dude, it's just
starting to get good.


645
0:25:22,52 --> 0:25:25,523
Paul: Big fish right now
Dave, look at him.


646
0:25:25,523 --> 0:25:26,724
Dave: Kevin lost a fish.


647
0:25:26,724 --> 0:25:28,459
It's possible his luck
may have run out.


648
0:25:28,459 --> 0:25:32,363
Tuna.com is back on
top, mark my word.


649
0:25:32,363 --> 0:25:33,798
Going down,
going down.


650
0:25:33,798 --> 0:25:35,766
Paul: Look at the
size of that mark.


651
0:25:35,766 --> 0:25:37,501
Dave: Going under water.


652
0:25:37,501 --> 0:25:38,636
These are no little
pencil marks.


653
0:25:38,636 --> 0:25:41,539
these are big, fat, black;
like magic marker marks,


654
0:25:41,539 --> 0:25:53,317
just big streaks


655
0:25:53,317 --> 0:25:54,318
Sandro: Coast Guard.


656
0:25:54,318 --> 0:25:59,123
Paul: Coast Guard's
here Dave, visitation.


657
0:25:59,123 --> 0:26:3,27
Dave: Getting my 20th
boarding of the year again.


658
0:26:3,27 --> 0:26:3,828
Coast Guard: How
you guys doing?


659
0:26:3,828 --> 0:26:4,862
Dave: What's going on?


660
0:26:4,862 --> 0:26:5,83
Coast Guard: We're going
to send a two person


661
0:26:5,83 --> 0:26:6,697
boarding team on.


662
0:26:6,697 --> 0:26:7,632
Dave: Yep.


663
0:26:7,632 --> 0:26:8,599
Coast Guard: All
right, do you have any


664
0:26:8,599 --> 0:26:10,501
lines port side
good here?


665
0:26:10,501 --> 0:26:14,5
Dave: Nope.


666
0:26:14,5 --> 0:26:16,44
He's doing a routine
boarding, that's it.


667
0:26:16,44 --> 0:26:20,611
Checks survival suits, all
our permits, license,


668
0:26:20,611 --> 0:26:24,649
TWIC card, that's it.


669
0:26:24,649 --> 0:26:25,983
Seems like the Coast
Guard always comes at


670
0:26:25,983 --> 0:26:27,451
the most unopportune time.


671
0:26:27,451 --> 0:26:29,92
Whenever we're marking fish,
they come on the boat.


672
0:26:29,92 --> 0:26:31,422
And because they
come on our boat,


673
0:26:31,422 --> 0:26:34,191
I make sure everything is in
the best shape possible.


674
0:26:34,191 --> 0:26:36,56
I make sure all my
paperwork is up to date.


675
0:26:36,56 --> 0:26:37,662
Do you want all my
documentation?


676
0:26:37,662 --> 0:26:38,696
Coast Guard: Yes please.


677
0:26:38,696 --> 0:26:43,768
Dave: Come on in, come
on in, here you go.


678
0:26:43,768 --> 0:26:45,97
Coast Guard: Thank you.


679
0:26:45,97 --> 0:26:47,738
This regulation's, you
know, making sure that


680
0:26:47,738 --> 0:26:49,707
everybody that's out here
fishing is fishing properly,


681
0:26:49,707 --> 0:26:50,941
fishing safely.


682
0:26:50,941 --> 0:26:52,376
It's still a business
and with every business


683
0:26:52,376 --> 0:26:53,744
there's regulations.


684
0:26:53,744 --> 0:26:55,312
You make sure everybody's
got a fair chance


685
0:26:55,312 --> 0:26:58,115
and make sure the fish have
a fair chance as well.


686
0:26:58,115 --> 0:27:1,886
Paul: Everyone hates them
when they board them.


687
0:27:1,886 --> 0:27:3,788
And I'm like, "Wh, Why?"


688
0:27:3,788 --> 0:27:5,623
"Because you aggravated
cause they're taking up


689
0:27:5,623 --> 0:27:7,258
a little bit of
your fishing time?"


690
0:27:7,258 --> 0:27:9,827
Big deal!


691
0:27:9,827 --> 0:27:11,162
It's nota big deal.


692
0:27:11,162 --> 0:27:14,732
We're lucky they're
here to help us.


693
0:27:14,732 --> 0:27:17,935
So thank God,
keep coming.


694
0:27:17,935 --> 0:27:22,239
Dave: It's all here.


695
0:27:22,239 --> 0:27:34,885
Big boy, that ones
head and tail on.


696
0:27:34,885 --> 0:27:36,87
Coast Guard: No
violations sir.


697
0:27:36,87 --> 0:27:37,488
Once again, you are in
compliance and we


698
0:27:37,488 --> 0:27:38,556
do appreciate that.


699
0:27:38,556 --> 0:27:39,59
Dave: Alright.


700
0:27:39,59 --> 0:27:41,58
Coast Guard: Make our
lives a lot easier.


701
0:27:41,58 --> 0:27:42,56
Dave: And thank you
guys, thanks a lot.


702
0:27:42,56 --> 0:27:43,594
Coast Guard: Thank
you very much again.


703
0:27:43,594 --> 0:27:44,528
Dave: I'll see ya; I'll
see ya next year.


704
0:27:44,528 --> 0:27:46,797
Coast Guard:
Yeah. [laughs]


705
0:27:46,797 --> 0:27:48,132
Dave: All right,
see you guys.


706
0:27:48,132 --> 0:27:49,633
Thanks for being
here again.


707
0:27:49,633 --> 0:27:51,68
Coast Guard: Thanks
guys, good luck.


708
0:27:51,68 --> 0:27:52,436
Dave: Appreciate it.


709
0:27:52,436 --> 0:27:57,875
Paul: I'm not arrested
and we're good to go.


710
0:27:57,875 --> 0:27:59,91
Kevin: We are headed for
Stellwagen Bank.


711
0:27:59,91 --> 0:28:4,14
About 13 miles south
of Gloucester.


712
0:28:4,14 --> 0:28:6,884
Looks good, conditions
are okay and


713
0:28:6,884 --> 0:28:10,821
we'll see what happens.


714
0:28:10,821 --> 0:28:13,424
I wasn't convinced that
Dave actually caught


715
0:28:13,424 --> 0:28:14,458
a bigger fish.


716
0:28:14,458 --> 0:28:16,393
I didn't think he had it.


717
0:28:16,393 --> 0:28:17,828
Was I worried?


718
0:28:17,828 --> 0:28:19,83
A little bit.


719
0:28:19,83 --> 0:28:23,701
Sometimes I get this
little inner feeling when


720
0:28:23,701 --> 0:28:25,903
I know we're gonna
catch a fish.


721
0:28:25,903 --> 0:28:27,271
I don't know what it is.


722
0:28:27,271 --> 0:28:30,407
But Scott knows what
I'm talking about


723
0:28:30,407 --> 0:28:33,878
with that inner
feeling right?


724
0:28:33,878 --> 0:28:34,879
Greg: Got one coming up.


725
0:28:34,879 --> 0:28:36,147
Streaking right up.


726
0:28:36,147 --> 0:28:37,581
Oh, that's a mark!


727
0:28:37,581 --> 0:28:39,683
Kevin: We're marking a
fish and I can tell


728
0:28:39,683 --> 0:28:41,552
this fish is big.


729
0:28:41,552 --> 0:28:43,988
Greg: Holy moly,
there's the real deal.


730
0:28:43,988 --> 0:28:45,122
Scott: It's (bleep) long!


731
0:28:45,122 --> 0:28:47,458
Kevin: Dave's definitely
been taken down a peg.


732
0:28:47,458 --> 0:28:50,427
Now it's, it's time to
finish him off.


733
0:28:50,427 --> 0:28:51,962
Deep in the water
as fast as we can.


734
0:28:51,962 --> 0:28:54,732
Greg: Streaking right up,
got em right up to,


735
0:28:54,732 --> 0:28:55,8
right off the bottom.


736
0:28:55,8 --> 0:28:57,34
Kevin: You know he's 20
feet under the boat.


737
0:28:57,34 --> 0:28:58,702
Pull a bait down.


738
0:28:58,702 --> 0:29:1,405
Then he swims up and
a big bird grabs it.


739
0:29:1,405 --> 0:29:3,307
You know, sheer water.


740
0:29:3,307 --> 0:29:5,876
Scott: He's got your
bait, he's got your bait.


741
0:29:5,876 --> 0:29:7,11
Kevin: Does he?


742
0:29:7,11 --> 0:29:8,779
Mother (bleep)!


743
0:29:8,779 --> 0:29:10,147
Greg: Yeah, yeah,
get out of here!


744
0:29:10,147 --> 0:29:11,782
Kevin: That pissed
me off, you know?


745
0:29:11,782 --> 0:29:13,784
We get a bird
instead of a tuna.


746
0:29:13,784 --> 0:29:18,856
Greg: Screw, come on fish!


747
0:29:18,856 --> 0:29:24,195
Come on back,
time to eat!


748
0:29:24,195 --> 0:29:25,563
Kevin: This is gonna be
my opportunity to


749
0:29:25,563 --> 0:29:30,334
kick Dave's ass
once and for all.


750
0:29:30,334 --> 0:29:32,136
Greg: We're on, we're
on, we're on, we're on!


751
0:29:32,136 --> 0:29:34,138
Crank, crank, come on!


752
0:29:34,138 --> 0:29:35,739
Kevin: Crank it, crank
hard, crank hard!


753
0:29:35,739 --> 0:29:36,74
Greg: We're tight!


754
0:29:36,74 --> 0:29:38,909
Kevin: Move to
the stern, go!


755
0:29:38,909 --> 0:29:42,46
I just hope it
measures up.


756
0:29:42,46 --> 0:29:49,153
Oh (bleep), pulled
the hook, damn it!


757
0:29:49,153 --> 0:29:53,224
(bleep)!


758
0:29:53,224 --> 0:29:54,358
We're on, we're on!


759
0:29:54,358 --> 0:29:56,26
We're in, uh, what
I call a frenzy.


760
0:29:56,26 --> 0:29:58,395
We'd hooked a fish,
we'd lose him.


761
0:29:58,395 --> 0:30:0,364
We'd get back on the
anchor and that rod


762
0:30:0,364 --> 0:30:2,399
would bend again.


763
0:30:2,399 --> 0:30:4,235
Scott: Ah, mother (bleep)!


764
0:30:4,235 --> 0:30:7,4
Kevin: The rod would pop
and the line would break.


765
0:30:7,4 --> 0:30:7,938
You broke it?


766
0:30:7,938 --> 0:30:9,34
It was just disappointing


767
0:30:9,34 --> 0:30:13,477
Come on, what
the (bleep)?


768
0:30:13,477 --> 0:30:20,15
Greg: What the
hell's going on?


769
0:30:20,15 --> 0:30:21,352
Kevin: We just dropped
another one here,


770
0:30:21,352 --> 0:30:22,386
pulled the hook.


771
0:30:22,386 --> 0:30:23,287
He was the real deal.


772
0:30:23,287 --> 0:30:24,755
I mean he was a big
one, you know?


773
0:30:24,755 --> 0:30:26,824
I, I'd say he
wasn't a short.


774
0:30:26,824 --> 0:30:29,26
I got gypped.


775
0:30:29,26 --> 0:30:32,129
Dave: Hey Paul, Kevin just
pulled another hook.


776
0:30:32,129 --> 0:30:36,433
Paul: [laughs].


777
0:30:36,433 --> 0:30:41,138
How's that feel Kevin?


778
0:30:41,138 --> 0:30:52,616
Kevin: That's tuna
frustration right there.


779
0:30:52,616 --> 0:30:55,219
Ralph: Hooking big one,
they're getting away.


780
0:30:55,219 --> 0:30:56,553
It's been a rough week.


781
0:30:56,553 --> 0:30:58,489
I keep spending money
to come out here and


782
0:30:58,489 --> 0:30:59,556
fish every day.


783
0:30:59,556 --> 0:31:2,226
And every day I come home
poorer than when I left.


784
0:31:2,226 --> 0:31:3,794
These things might have
a chance to get away


785
0:31:3,794 --> 0:31:6,63
from the dogfish.


786
0:31:6,63 --> 0:31:7,932
Pirate: I do this for
a living, not for fun.


787
0:31:7,932 --> 0:31:9,733
Don't get me wrong, I love
fishing, and all that stuff.


788
0:31:9,733 --> 0:31:11,769
But when I get, you get
into a dry spell like that,


789
0:31:11,769 --> 0:31:14,104
sometimes you second guess
yourself and is it worth me


790
0:31:14,104 --> 0:31:18,75
going out that way for 10,
12 hours a day, you know,


791
0:31:18,75 --> 0:31:19,51
busting your hump,
you know?


792
0:31:19,51 --> 0:31:33,924
In the cold weather.


793
0:31:33,924 --> 0:31:35,926
Mike: I think my volt
meter is (bleep) up.


794
0:31:35,926 --> 0:31:37,394
Ralph: We just got a
radio call from Mike on


795
0:31:37,394 --> 0:31:40,64
the Bad Dog that he's
got a dead battery.


796
0:31:40,64 --> 0:31:41,932
If you're dead in the
water with no battery,


797
0:31:41,932 --> 0:31:43,667
you're really in bad shape.


798
0:31:43,667 --> 0:31:45,569
You're susceptible to
getting run over or


799
0:31:45,569 --> 0:31:47,271
to drift onto the rocks.


800
0:31:47,271 --> 0:31:49,6
Anything bad can happen.


801
0:31:49,6 --> 0:31:50,708
Mike: So I'm (bleep).


802
0:31:50,708 --> 0:31:52,209
I don't know, I don't
know what to do here.


803
0:31:52,209 --> 0:31:53,41
Ralph: Shut everything off.


804
0:31:53,41 --> 0:31:55,245
In a case like this, the
fisherman with the dead


805
0:31:55,245 --> 0:31:57,848
battery takes precedence
over the tuna fish.


806
0:31:57,848 --> 0:31:59,483
So we're gonna have
to reel our lines in,


807
0:31:59,483 --> 0:32:1,285
and haul our anchor,
and go take care of our


808
0:32:1,285 --> 0:32:3,554
friend Mike on the Bad Dog.


809
0:32:3,554 --> 0:32:5,356
Sit tight, I'll come
over and get you.


810
0:32:5,356 --> 0:32:6,223
Mike: Okay.


811
0:32:6,223 --> 0:32:7,324
Ralph: Reel 'em up, Pirate.


812
0:32:7,324 --> 0:32:8,726
Well this is the
life that we chose,


813
0:32:8,726 --> 0:32:9,994
so these are the
decisions we make when


814
0:32:9,994 --> 0:32:11,28
we're out at sea.


815
0:32:11,28 --> 0:32:12,262
If it was to ever
happen to me,


816
0:32:12,262 --> 0:32:13,764
I hope somebody would
reel their lines in


817
0:32:13,764 --> 0:32:14,765
and tow me in.


818
0:32:14,765 --> 0:32:16,3
We're on a rescue
mission here.


819
0:32:16,3 --> 0:32:19,903
Save Mikey Bad Dog from
the white sharks tonight.


820
0:32:19,903 --> 0:32:21,572
Nobody wants to go
out there and die,


821
0:32:21,572 --> 0:32:24,108
or nobody wants to
have anybody hurt,


822
0:32:24,108 --> 0:32:26,643
especially as a Captain.


823
0:32:26,643 --> 0:32:28,479
You know, I owned another
gill netter at one time.


824
0:32:28,479 --> 0:32:30,514
I get a phone call from the
Coast Guard that the boat


825
0:32:30,514 --> 0:32:33,217
sunk and there was two
people in the life raft,


826
0:32:33,217 --> 0:32:36,12
when I know three left.


827
0:32:36,12 --> 0:32:38,288
Fortunately we did
recover all three guys,


828
0:32:38,288 --> 0:32:44,128
but that was a horrible,
horrible feeling.


829
0:32:44,128 --> 0:32:46,897
Hey, do you have
shore power?


830
0:32:46,897 --> 0:32:49,66
Best thing is let me
tow you to the dock.


831
0:32:49,66 --> 0:32:52,369
Get ready to
haul his anchor.


832
0:32:52,369 --> 0:32:53,837
A little anchor
and a lot of chain.


833
0:32:53,837 --> 0:33:1,512
I got the other way around.


834
0:33:1,512 --> 0:33:3,47
Go down through here.


835
0:33:3,47 --> 0:33:5,82
And that's just
basically the way it is.


836
0:33:5,82 --> 0:33:6,283
It's a fact
of tuna fishing,


837
0:33:6,283 --> 0:33:8,85
it's just a
fact of life here.


838
0:33:8,85 --> 0:33:9,987
Hey, I'm doing for him
what he would do for me.


839
0:33:9,987 --> 0:33:11,822
That's the way it
works out here.


840
0:33:11,822 --> 0:33:26,703
Just helping a
friendly fisherman.


841
0:33:26,703 --> 0:33:28,305
Kevin: Want to get some
blood on the deck here.


842
0:33:28,305 --> 0:33:30,34
We should be, uh, we should
be on our way home with


843
0:33:30,34 --> 0:33:34,812
three in the boat, in early.


844
0:33:34,812 --> 0:33:36,647
Greg: Not going good today.


845
0:33:36,647 --> 0:33:37,681
Kevin: What happened?


846
0:33:37,681 --> 0:33:38,482
You know?


847
0:33:38,482 --> 0:33:39,583
I don't know,
I don't know.


848
0:33:39,583 --> 0:33:41,585
Somebody put the, put the
whammy on me, I guess.


849
0:33:41,585 --> 0:33:43,387
I don't know,
maybe it was Dave.


850
0:33:43,387 --> 0:33:55,532
Greg: Dot-Com, Dot-Com.


851
0:33:55,532 --> 0:33:57,468
I'm on, I'm on!


852
0:33:57,468 --> 0:33:58,802
Kevin: Hold it, Greg.


853
0:33:58,802 --> 0:34:0,637
He's towing the boat, let
him just pull us right


854
0:34:0,637 --> 0:34:2,306
around, everything's good.


855
0:34:2,306 --> 0:34:4,241
That's the real deal.


856
0:34:4,241 --> 0:34:6,977
Scott: Pull ahead, Greg.


857
0:34:6,977 --> 0:34:9,12
Kevin: So we, we
get back on the ball


858
0:34:9,12 --> 0:34:20,29
for the fourth time.


859
0:34:20,29 --> 0:34:22,493
(Bleep)!


860
0:34:22,493 --> 0:34:26,263
(Bleep)!


861
0:34:26,263 --> 0:34:29,299
And sure enough,
broke 'em off again.


862
0:34:29,299 --> 0:34:33,36
You got to be
(bleep) kidding me!


863
0:34:33,36 --> 0:34:34,238
Broke at the crotch.


864
0:34:34,238 --> 0:34:35,739
Greg: Same (bleep).


865
0:34:35,739 --> 0:34:38,142
Kevin: Same hook, too.


866
0:34:38,142 --> 0:34:40,11
Gone, again.


867
0:34:40,11 --> 0:34:41,678
I can't even believe
it, you know?


868
0:34:41,678 --> 0:34:43,413
I'm just beside myself now.


869
0:34:43,413 --> 0:34:47,918
Now I'm pissed, Greg's
pissed, Scott's pissed;


870
0:34:47,918 --> 0:34:51,21
we're all, we're all upset.


871
0:34:51,21 --> 0:34:53,724
It's a complete nightmare.


872
0:34:53,724 --> 0:34:56,793
We mark another fish, I look
over and wham, we're on.


873
0:34:56,793 --> 0:34:59,96
Number five, big fish.


874
0:34:59,96 --> 0:35:12,91
Just burning rubber and
pow, we break the line.


875
0:35:12,91 --> 0:35:15,512
Now we've lost five.


876
0:35:15,512 --> 0:35:20,83
It's, uh, I've had it.


877
0:35:20,83 --> 0:35:21,585
Scott: A loyal,
oh, we're on now!


878
0:35:21,585 --> 0:35:22,619
We're on!


879
0:35:22,619 --> 0:35:23,987
Kevin: He taking line?


880
0:35:23,987 --> 0:35:26,456
Scott: Yeah, he's
pulling line now.


881
0:35:26,456 --> 0:35:28,125
Kevin: It's marking
like it's a tuna.


882
0:35:28,125 --> 0:35:31,94
Scott: Yo, there he
goes, he's taking line.


883
0:35:31,94 --> 0:35:32,229
Greg: Forward!


884
0:35:32,229 --> 0:35:36,233
Oh, oh, oh, don't let
that mono tungsten blow!


885
0:35:36,233 --> 0:35:37,701
Let's see, we're gonna
see him right now.


886
0:35:37,701 --> 0:35:50,214
It is a blue nose.


887
0:35:50,214 --> 0:36:8,599
Kevin: This is the worst
day in my fishing career.


888
0:36:8,599 --> 0:36:9,533
Dave: There he is.


889
0:36:9,533 --> 0:36:10,934
That's a 900 pound
fish right there.


890
0:36:10,934 --> 0:36:12,502
Look at him, that's
a (bleep) jumbo and


891
0:36:12,502 --> 0:36:13,57
a half right there.


892
0:36:13,57 --> 0:36:14,871
I look back up
again, there's two,


893
0:36:14,871 --> 0:36:16,273
there's three,
there's four.


894
0:36:16,273 --> 0:36:17,574
Un-(bleep) believable.


895
0:36:17,574 --> 0:36:19,61
And these are just
all big slobs,


896
0:36:19,61 --> 0:36:31,488
there's no little
fish there.


897
0:36:31,488 --> 0:36:32,589
Sandro: We're on, we're on!


898
0:36:32,589 --> 0:36:34,725
Paul: And don't pull
your, watch the rod.


899
0:36:34,725 --> 0:36:35,859
Watch the rod.


900
0:36:35,859 --> 0:36:36,76
Sandro: I got it.


901
0:36:36,76 --> 0:36:37,995
Paul: Watch the rod.


902
0:36:37,995 --> 0:36:42,566
Dave: Yeah, I don't have a
good feeling about this one.


903
0:36:42,566 --> 0:36:44,34
Paul: Is it a sharky?


904
0:36:44,34 --> 0:36:45,369
Dave: Looks like
a big blue dog.


905
0:36:45,369 --> 0:36:48,38
Looks like a big
blue dog to me.


906
0:36:48,38 --> 0:36:51,541
Sandro: A (bleep) huge blue
dog, telling me, huge.


907
0:36:51,541 --> 0:36:53,944
Dave: Right now a shark is
the last thing we need.


908
0:36:53,944 --> 0:36:55,45
You want to cut it?


909
0:36:55,45 --> 0:36:56,647
Paul: We don't even
know what it is, yet.


910
0:36:56,647 --> 0:36:57,814
You never know, dude.


911
0:36:57,814 --> 0:36:58,949
Dave: (Bleep) blue dog.


912
0:36:58,949 --> 0:36:59,983
I had the scissor.


913
0:36:59,983 --> 0:37:1,18
I was just gonna cut it,


914
0:37:1,18 --> 0:37:2,719
and move on and
get back to fishing.


915
0:37:2,719 --> 0:37:4,87
And then all of a sudden.


916
0:37:4,87 --> 0:37:5,589
Holy (bleep).


917
0:37:5,589 --> 0:37:7,291
It's a tuna.


918
0:37:7,291 --> 0:37:8,825
Holy (bleep).


919
0:37:8,825 --> 0:37:9,693
Sandro: Wow.


920
0:37:9,693 --> 0:37:10,761
Dave: I was
definitely mistaken.


921
0:37:10,761 --> 0:37:11,728
Stop the boat.


922
0:37:11,728 --> 0:37:12,462
Neutral.


923
0:37:12,462 --> 0:37:13,163
Forward right.


924
0:37:13,163 --> 0:37:14,64
Bring him to the stern.


925
0:37:14,64 --> 0:37:14,865
Kick it around.


926
0:37:14,865 --> 0:37:15,799
Yeah, pull right.


927
0:37:15,799 --> 0:37:17,601
There you go, nice.


928
0:37:17,601 --> 0:37:19,836
Harpoon.


929
0:37:19,836 --> 0:37:20,47
Keep going.


930
0:37:20,47 --> 0:37:21,238
Come on.


931
0:37:21,238 --> 0:37:22,172
Get on him.


932
0:37:22,172 --> 0:37:23,206
Paul: Whoa!


933
0:37:23,206 --> 0:37:24,908
Dave: Go, go, there he is!


934
0:37:24,908 --> 0:37:27,1
Where's the harpoon?


935
0:37:27,1 --> 0:37:27,644
Forward!


936
0:37:27,644 --> 0:37:28,445
Pull left!


937
0:37:28,445 --> 0:37:29,212
Hurry up!


938
0:37:29,212 --> 0:37:29,913
Hold it!


939
0:37:29,913 --> 0:37:31,214
Let go, get up!


940
0:37:31,214 --> 0:37:33,25
Go, go!


941
0:37:33,25 --> 0:37:35,652
Let it go!


942
0:37:35,652 --> 0:37:36,586
Throw it forward!


943
0:37:36,586 --> 0:37:37,721
Forward, forward!


944
0:37:37,721 --> 0:37:40,123
All right, clear!


945
0:37:40,123 --> 0:37:41,124
Forward, right!


946
0:37:41,124 --> 0:37:43,994
Paul: I get smashed
in the (bleep) head!


947
0:37:43,994 --> 0:37:47,998
I harpoon the fish, and a
safety line came up and


948
0:37:47,998 --> 0:37:55,238
smashed me in the head.


949
0:37:55,238 --> 0:37:56,707
(Bleep) that hit me
right in the head,


950
0:37:56,707 --> 0:37:57,841
that (bleep) thing.


951
0:37:57,841 --> 0:37:59,9
Dave: What, what hit you?


952
0:37:59,9 --> 0:38:0,243
Paul: This, wrapped around.


953
0:38:0,243 --> 0:38:1,311
Dave: Oh, really?


954
0:38:1,311 --> 0:38:3,58
Paul: It (bleep) came off
the line and went smack!


955
0:38:3,58 --> 0:38:7,284
Oh, that hurt, like
a bitch, whatever,


956
0:38:7,284 --> 0:38:9,353
we're gonna get paid.


957
0:38:9,353 --> 0:38:14,491
He's big, too, (bleep)
like 700 pounds.


958
0:38:14,491 --> 0:38:15,659
Dave: I almost
cut off an 8, 000


959
0:38:15,659 --> 0:38:17,361
dollar fish thinking
it was a blue dog.


960
0:38:17,361 --> 0:38:20,97
Holy (bleep) are
we (bleep) lucky!


961
0:38:20,97 --> 0:38:21,164
He's a cute little one.


962
0:38:21,164 --> 0:38:22,232
All right here we go.


963
0:38:22,232 --> 0:38:25,268
Paul: Wind him right in.


964
0:38:25,268 --> 0:38:26,403
Oh that's (bleep).


965
0:38:26,403 --> 0:38:27,637
Dave: Dude, that's
a nice fish.


966
0:38:27,637 --> 0:38:28,905
Paul: Oh my God.


967
0:38:28,905 --> 0:38:30,14
That's (bleep) sweet, too.


968
0:38:30,14 --> 0:38:31,908
Look at the color
on that fin.


969
0:38:31,908 --> 0:38:34,444
Dave: Holy (bleep).


970
0:38:34,444 --> 0:38:35,612
Holy (bleep).


971
0:38:35,612 --> 0:38:36,747
Now that's fat.


972
0:38:36,747 --> 0:38:38,415
That fish is
caulked with fat.


973
0:38:38,415 --> 0:38:41,118
This fish here, this is an
8,000 dollar fish, plus.


974
0:38:41,118 --> 0:38:42,919
Kevin, you gave
it your best shot,


975
0:38:42,919 --> 0:38:45,789
but nobody beats
Tuna.com, nobody


976
0:38:45,789 --> 0:38:46,89
Paul: That's a
beautiful fish.


977
0:38:46,89 --> 0:38:49,526
That shape is incredible.


978
0:38:49,526 --> 0:38:51,161
Dave: Dude, we thought that
was a (bleep) blue dog.


979
0:38:51,161 --> 0:38:52,396
It fooled you too.


980
0:38:52,396 --> 0:38:54,97
The ironic thing is, we're
probably gonna get the most


981
0:38:54,97 --> 0:38:55,832
money for this fish, right?


982
0:38:55,832 --> 0:38:56,933
Paul: Out of any of 'em.


983
0:38:56,933 --> 0:38:58,502
Dave: And I was getting
ready to cut 'em off.


984
0:38:58,502 --> 0:39:0,3
Two slobs in 24 hours.


985
0:39:0,3 --> 0:39:1,638
Now we just need to
get back to the dock and


986
0:39:1,638 --> 0:39:3,173
weigh these babies in.


987
0:39:3,173 --> 0:39:18,422
Look out Kevin,
we're coming for you.


988
0:39:18,422 --> 0:39:19,489
Marciano: We're
on our way in,


989
0:39:19,489 --> 0:39:21,24
we had a great day today.


990
0:39:21,24 --> 0:39:24,561
The weather was nice, flat,
calm here and Joe came out.


991
0:39:24,561 --> 0:39:26,329
We got a fish,
right off the bat.


992
0:39:26,329 --> 0:39:28,165
I told you he was good luck.


993
0:39:28,165 --> 0:39:30,2
He had a nice 900 pounder
laying on the deck back


994
0:39:30,2 --> 0:39:31,268
here, you know?


995
0:39:31,268 --> 0:39:33,3
So all in all, it
was a great day.


996
0:39:33,3 --> 0:39:34,938
Joe: One more good one.


997
0:39:34,938 --> 0:39:37,4
Marciano: This is getting
to be habit forming.


998
0:39:37,4 --> 0:39:38,809
Nancy: Joseph, Joseph.


999
0:39:38,809 --> 0:39:40,277
Joe: Mom.


1000
0:39:40,277 --> 0:39:42,312
Marciano: Everything went
well, we got the fish.


1001
0:39:42,312 --> 0:39:44,347
Nancy and Eva met
us down the boat,


1002
0:39:44,347 --> 0:39:47,551
so had the whole big family
thing going on down there.


1003
0:39:47,551 --> 0:39:48,652
Joe: Big one, huh?


1004
0:39:48,652 --> 0:39:49,886
Nancy: That's huge!


1005
0:39:49,886 --> 0:39:51,955
Marciano: That's when it
all comes together nicely.


1006
0:39:51,955 --> 0:39:54,658
Joe comes out with us that
one day and then, boom.


1007
0:39:54,658 --> 0:39:57,561
We come back with
that big, huge fish.


1008
0:39:57,561 --> 0:39:59,763
Are you gonna take a
ride on this one, Eva?


1009
0:39:59,763 --> 0:40:2,265
Eva: I guess.


1010
0:40:2,265 --> 0:40:3,567
Marciano: Hey he's.


1011
0:40:3,567 --> 0:40:5,669
Eva: It puked out!


1012
0:40:5,669 --> 0:40:7,37
Marciano: It's
like a horsy, Eva.


1013
0:40:7,37 --> 0:40:10,774
It's a fish as big as horse.


1014
0:40:10,774 --> 0:40:12,576
We got it early
in the morning.


1015
0:40:12,576 --> 0:40:14,778
First bait in the water,
20 minutes of fishing.


1016
0:40:14,778 --> 0:40:16,513
We had my good luck
charm on the boat,


1017
0:40:16,513 --> 0:40:18,148
we had Joe with us,
so we should do well


1018
0:40:18,148 --> 0:40:19,149
with this one.


1019
0:40:19,149 --> 0:40:20,16
I'm confident.


1020
0:40:20,16 --> 0:40:21,885
Eva, you gonna
get a ride on him?


1021
0:40:21,885 --> 0:40:23,72
Some kids get
to ride horses.


1022
0:40:23,72 --> 0:40:25,822
Eva gets to ride
giant blue fin tuna,


1023
0:40:25,822 --> 0:40:27,23
that's what she likes.


1024
0:40:27,23 --> 0:40:28,91
Say giddy up.


1025
0:40:28,91 --> 0:40:29,726
Eva: Giddy up.


1026
0:40:29,726 --> 0:40:34,364
Marciano: Tails up, just
keep getting bigger.


1027
0:40:34,364 --> 0:40:36,466
This is a nice one,
this a gorgeous fish,


1028
0:40:36,466 --> 0:40:38,702
it's got real nice quality
going for it, too.


1029
0:40:38,702 --> 0:40:40,837
I'm anxious to see what
these guys got to say,


1030
0:40:40,837 --> 0:40:43,673
but I really think we're
gonna do well with this one.


1031
0:40:43,673 --> 0:40:44,741
Martin: 622.


1032
0:40:44,741 --> 0:40:46,877
Nancy: 640.


1033
0:40:46,877 --> 0:40:47,844
Joe: Augh!


1034
0:40:47,844 --> 0:40:49,12
Martin: You didn't make it.


1035
0:40:49,12 --> 0:40:49,846
Marciano: What is it?


1036
0:40:49,846 --> 0:40:52,82
Martin: 589,
592 minus three.


1037
0:40:52,82 --> 0:40:52,949
Eva: What?


1038
0:40:52,949 --> 0:40:54,117
He was so big though.


1039
0:40:54,117 --> 0:40:55,85
Joe: 589.


1040
0:40:55,85 --> 0:40:56,19
Martin: 589.


1041
0:40:56,19 --> 0:40:56,92
Joe: It's a paycheck.


1042
0:40:56,92 --> 0:41:0,323
Nancy: Very good,
thank you Mr. Tuna.


1043
0:41:0,323 --> 0:41:1,591
Marciano: All righty.


1044
0:41:1,591 --> 0:41:12,335
Pleasure doing business
as usual, Martin.


1045
0:41:12,335 --> 0:41:15,238
Ralph: Tonight, I'm the
Coast Guard, tonight.


1046
0:41:15,238 --> 0:41:17,173
I'm the rescue tonight.


1047
0:41:17,173 --> 0:41:18,675
Captain Ralph to the rescue.


1048
0:41:18,675 --> 0:41:20,81
Do-do-do do-do do-do.


1049
0:41:20,81 --> 0:41:22,178
I needed a fish
pretty badly.


1050
0:41:22,178 --> 0:41:25,181
But sometimes, circumstances
get in the way.


1051
0:41:25,181 --> 0:41:26,983
Pirate: There's an
unwritten code around here.


1052
0:41:26,983 --> 0:41:28,418
If you're broke down or
something like that,


1053
0:41:28,418 --> 0:41:30,153
you know the next guy's
gonna come over and help you


1054
0:41:30,153 --> 0:41:31,621
out too, you know?


1055
0:41:31,621 --> 0:41:32,956
That's just the
thank you enough in


1056
0:41:32,956 --> 0:41:34,558
itself right there.


1057
0:41:34,558 --> 0:41:37,26
So how close we gonna be
able to drag him to is, uh.


1058
0:41:37,26 --> 0:41:38,495
Ralph: I'll get
him in there.


1059
0:41:38,495 --> 0:41:45,468
I'll float him
right to the pole.


1060
0:41:45,468 --> 0:41:49,739
There you go.


1061
0:41:49,739 --> 0:41:51,608
Mike: Yeah,
we're off Ralph.


1062
0:41:51,608 --> 0:41:52,876
Thanks Ralph.


1063
0:41:52,876 --> 0:41:54,978
Ralph: All right, Mike,
have a good night.


1064
0:41:54,978 --> 0:41:56,313
So there's no
tuna this week,


1065
0:41:56,313 --> 0:41:58,915
which is hard for
a short season.


1066
0:41:58,915 --> 0:42:0,75
I'm in the hole now, so
we're gonna have to work


1067
0:42:0,75 --> 0:42:16,366
extra hard from here on in,
in order to make ends meet.


1068
0:42:16,366 --> 0:42:17,867
Dave: Yeah, the fish
is, uh, definitely over


1069
0:42:17,867 --> 0:42:19,102
a thousand pounds.


1070
0:42:19,102 --> 0:42:21,938
Gotta wait till we get back
to the dock, see how much.


1071
0:42:21,938 --> 0:42:23,873
Hey, Sandro, you're gonna
have to help me pinch this.


1072
0:42:23,873 --> 0:42:25,275
Sandro: That's good.


1073
0:42:25,275 --> 0:42:26,776
Man: Ready?


1074
0:42:26,776 --> 0:42:27,911
Good.


1075
0:42:27,911 --> 0:42:30,58
Paul: No matter how (bleep)
nuts Dave could be,


1076
0:42:30,58 --> 0:42:32,215
you gotta give him credit.


1077
0:42:32,215 --> 0:42:34,5
Dave: That's a jumbo, huh?


1078
0:42:34,5 --> 0:42:35,919
That's a jumbo.


1079
0:42:35,919 --> 0:42:39,322
Paul: He sets out to catch a
thousand pounder, he does.


1080
0:42:39,322 --> 0:42:42,92
Dave: This is def, this is
definitely bigger than his.


1081
0:42:42,92 --> 0:42:43,493
Big one.


1082
0:42:43,493 --> 0:42:46,96
Paul: He's a
(bleep) monster,


1083
0:42:46,96 --> 0:42:49,165
nice big fat (bleep).


1084
0:42:49,165 --> 0:42:51,167
Dave: He's a monster.


1085
0:42:51,167 --> 0:42:53,903
Man: Let's see what
we've got here.


1086
0:42:53,903 --> 0:42:56,139
Dave: I can't, I
can barely see it.


1087
0:42:56,139 --> 0:42:58,441
Man: 1,015.


1088
0:42:58,441 --> 0:43:0,71
Paul: That mother (bleep)!


1089
0:43:0,71 --> 0:43:2,512
Dave: Yeah, Kevin's fish was
a little bit bigger than


1090
0:43:2,512 --> 0:43:5,482
ours but I said I'd get a
thousand pounder, and I did.


1091
0:43:5,482 --> 0:43:7,484
And that takes skill.


1092
0:43:7,484 --> 0:43:9,52
Yeah, Kevin may have
got the record for the


1093
0:43:9,52 --> 0:43:10,654
biggest fish for the
year, but I caught more


1094
0:43:10,654 --> 0:43:13,23
fish than everyone
this season.


1095
0:43:13,23 --> 0:43:26,67
He got lucky.


1096
0:43:26,67 --> 0:43:28,972
Sandro: Ah, there he is.


1097
0:43:28,972 --> 0:43:30,807
Kevin: Ah ha, look at this.


1098
0:43:30,807 --> 0:43:32,909
Just got in and, uh,
thought I'd pay a little


1099
0:43:32,909 --> 0:43:34,878
visit to my buddy Dave.


1100
0:43:34,878 --> 0:43:38,515
Heard he had a big fish, or
he'd killed a big fish today


1101
0:43:38,515 --> 0:43:40,45
and, uh, I wanted to see
what the weight was.


1102
0:43:40,45 --> 0:43:41,818
Dave: I'm not saying
it was bigger,


1103
0:43:41,818 --> 0:43:42,919
I'm not saying
it was bigger.


1104
0:43:42,919 --> 0:43:45,88
Kevin: Well you're out,
you're out, you're out.


1105
0:43:45,88 --> 0:43:46,256
Dave: You got us
beat yesterday.


1106
0:43:46,256 --> 0:43:47,657
What happened today?


1107
0:43:47,657 --> 0:43:50,326
Yeah, we saw your fish, your
fish came right up on top.


1108
0:43:50,326 --> 0:43:51,294
I was like, look, there's.


1109
0:43:51,294 --> 0:43:53,129
Scott: The whole time
he was on the top.


1110
0:43:53,129 --> 0:43:54,597
Kevin: Couldn't get him, we
drive on him, back on him,


1111
0:43:54,597 --> 0:43:56,199
he'd go down, he'd
come right back up.


1112
0:43:56,199 --> 0:43:57,701
He was big, that
was a big fish.


1113
0:43:57,701 --> 0:43:58,601
Dave: I saw it.


1114
0:43:58,601 --> 0:43:59,869
We saw it, we were
looking at it.


1115
0:43:59,869 --> 0:44:1,104
Paul: We saw the whole fish.


1116
0:44:1,104 --> 0:44:2,138
Dave: We saw your
boat over there.


1117
0:44:2,138 --> 0:44:4,941
Paul: He was like
1,300 dressed.


1118
0:44:4,941 --> 0:44:7,243
Kevin: That sounds
like a Dave story.


1119
0:44:7,243 --> 0:44:8,912
Paul: If he was a
little closer I could've


1120
0:44:8,912 --> 0:44:10,213
stuck him for you.


1121
0:44:10,213 --> 0:44:11,414
Kevin: Oh, man, we
needed like another.


1122
0:44:11,414 --> 0:44:12,515
Paul: Would've cut the
anchor line and back up.


1123
0:44:12,515 --> 0:44:13,65
Kevin: Another, what,
20 feet and we would've


1124
0:44:13,65 --> 0:44:14,451
got a dart in him.


1125
0:44:14,451 --> 0:44:15,485
Dave: That sucks.


1126
0:44:15,485 --> 0:44:17,487
Paul: (Bleep).


1127
0:44:17,487 --> 0:44:18,521
Kevin: Yep, that sucks.


1128
0:44:18,521 --> 0:44:19,522
Dave: It's a heartbreaker.


1129
0:44:19,522 --> 0:44:20,457
Kevin: The fish was nuts.


1130
0:44:20,457 --> 0:44:21,324
Just comes right.


1131
0:44:21,324 --> 0:44:24,194
Paul: (Bleep)
these tuna fish!


1132
0:44:24,194 --> 0:44:26,129
Kevin: I've said
it for many years.


1133
0:44:26,129 --> 0:44:30,667
It's, uh, greed, ego, and
jealousy in this fishery.


1134
0:44:30,667 --> 0:44:33,837
And they're jealous,
that's the bottom line.


1135
0:44:33,837 --> 0:44:34,871
You know?


1136
0:44:34,871 --> 0:44:36,74
It's, a, it's a trophy
fish what we have there.


1137
0:44:36,74 --> 0:46:36,74
We're still the
leaders here.
