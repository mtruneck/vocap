###0 but i have a sense something before your side of public policy polling
###3 ranked number one
###5 in most accurate
###6 in determining or in predicting that i'll come of the twenty twelve races
###12 is a very much of it
###13 credible polling organization and uh... and as i said it would simply the most
###18 accurate
###19 in the last election cycle okay
###20 so at first we start with amazing political facts a global warming is an
###24 approx
###26 illegally thirty seven percent of all voters say yes
###30 fifty eight percent republicans say yes
###34 forty one percent of independence
###36 that sounds huge majority of republic boaters
###39 who say that
###40 it's not this global warming is manmade
###43 global warming
###44 temperatures
###46 rising
###47 is a hulks
###49 but the tensions
###50 are rising
###51 the thermometers don't have a well-known liberal bias
###55 that's a fact
###57 but probably
###58 thirty seven percent of american voters and fifty eight percent or problems that
###62 buildings made up
###65 weather
###67 the sun mon
###68 carbon dioxide are all well known liberal bias
###71 on real
###72 alright nasty and a political ignorance that saddam hussein sa manila nine
###75 eleven others also fact
###77 he did not
###78 if you want you know as bush in cheney they say he did not knoll person who
###82 knows any information about this
###84 liza saddam hussein was connected nine eleven
###87 so for some erica's get it one
###89 uh... unfortunate percentage of the time twenty eight percent of voters say yeah
###93 sam did it
###94 and thirty six percent of romney voters
###97 of course
###98 so we have slightly more inner republican voters there saying the
###101 saddam hussein did now not not all cooked a
###105 things a wrong here and in america who are right on some of those top
###109 and i will conspiracy theories are off so for example on j_f_k_
###113 fifty one percent of voters believe it was a larger conspiracy but only twenty
###116 one percent say boswell act alone
###119 now there is
###120 tremendous evidence that oswald did not act alone
###123 so that fifty one percent
###125 could be right
###126 there are conspiracies
###129 as a crime in we see the people get together and do things and it's called a
###133 conspiracy
###134 could have happened in some cases that have all the government of course a kind
###137 of
###137 in fact we've seen it over and over right
###139 but it question is when how
###141 you can just pull it out as you're about to see in some of the crazier things
###145 but just physical something stays as it is not true or nikki betrayal on that

###177 look are their powerful and rich people
###179 who are more influential because they did a lot of money to publishers accor
###183 missile as there are
###185 but they're not synonym builder for
###188 smoke-filled room go up by rubber ball and at those or out those who turned up
###193 war was that that would in all of it all
