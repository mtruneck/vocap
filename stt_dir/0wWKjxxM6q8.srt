CHARLET DUBOC: Welcome to
"Fashion Week International,"


3
0:0:7,26 --> 0:0:10,545
the show that reports on the
most fabulous fashion weeks in


4
0:0:10,545 --> 0:0:14,2
the world and the culture and
politics behind them.


5
0:0:14,2 --> 0:0:17,69
This time we're in North Korea's
fun Southern cousin


6
0:0:17,69 --> 0:0:19,73
for Seoul fashion week.


7
0:0:19,73 --> 0:0:37,96



8
0:0:37,96 --> 0:0:43,5
It's 3:00 AM on a Monday night
and I'm shopping and so is


9
0:0:43,5 --> 0:0:46,64
everybody else.


10
0:0:46,64 --> 0:0:49,97
Everything you can see
around here is open.


11
0:0:49,97 --> 0:0:52,44
Nobody's drunk, nothing's
weird.


12
0:0:52,44 --> 0:0:54,49
It's the same as during the
day, it's just dark.


13
0:0:54,49 --> 0:1:1,37



14
0:1:1,37 --> 0:1:3,97
This is an underground station,
but as you can see it


15
0:1:3,97 --> 0:1:6,438
also takes you to the
underground shopping center.


16
0:1:6,438 --> 0:1:11,88



17
0:1:11,88 --> 0:1:13,2
It doesn't feel real.


18
0:1:13,2 --> 0:1:14,96
It's like a weird,


19
0:1:14,96 --> 0:1:19,73
post-apocalyptic underground world.


20
0:1:19,73 --> 0:1:21,6
Why is it open?


21
0:1:21,6 --> 0:1:22,256
Why aren't people in bed?


22
0:1:22,256 --> 0:1:25,72



23
0:1:25,72 --> 0:1:29,3
We're definitely going to come
back at a more civil hour.


24
0:1:29,3 --> 0:1:35,7



25
0:1:35,7 --> 0:1:39,14
I was in Seoul for
fashion week.


26
0:1:39,14 --> 0:1:41,44
Seoul is a megatropolis.


27
0:1:41,44 --> 0:1:44,91
A sprawling mass of perfect
order, and the most


28
0:1:44,91 --> 0:1:48,67
technologically advanced
city in the world.


29
0:1:48,67 --> 0:1:52,41
The curious antics of South
Korea's Northern neighbor has


30
0:1:52,41 --> 0:1:54,29
demanded much of the
world's attention


31
0:1:54,29 --> 0:1:56,69
over the last 40 years.


32
0:1:56,69 --> 0:2:0,89
But during that time, South
Korea has quietly been getting


33
0:2:0,89 --> 0:2:4,1
on with becoming the center
of Asian pop culture.


34
0:2:4,1 --> 0:2:7,765
To the point where K-pop is
poised to explode over the


35
0:2:7,765 --> 0:2:11,35
face of the world in a blitz
of highly choreographed


36
0:2:11,35 --> 0:2:13,65
titillation.


37
0:2:13,65 --> 0:2:17,55
The look here it is all about
flawless perfection, whilst


38
0:2:17,55 --> 0:2:20,14
the subtext seems to
be x-rated filth.


39
0:2:20,14 --> 0:2:23,88
And I was here to find out
just how far people were


40
0:2:23,88 --> 0:2:27,23
willing or expected to go in
pursuit of perfection.


41
0:2:27,23 --> 0:2:36,14



42
0:2:36,14 --> 0:2:39,93
Fashion week is being held at
the 1988 Olympic Village,


43
0:2:39,93 --> 0:2:42,21
across town from the
now well-known


44
0:2:42,21 --> 0:2:44,81
Gangnam area of Seoul.


45
0:2:44,81 --> 0:2:47,74
This gave me a chance to try
and navigate my way there


46
0:2:47,74 --> 0:2:49,815
through the super-techie
metro system.


47
0:2:49,815 --> 0:2:52,435



48
0:2:52,435 --> 0:2:54,93
You're just bombarded
with advertising


49
0:2:54,93 --> 0:2:58,96
and interactive stuff.


50
0:2:58,96 --> 0:3:2,95
So while you're waiting for the
train, you can engage with


51
0:3:2,95 --> 0:3:4,38
this thing--


52
0:3:4,38 --> 0:3:7,18
a virtual fitting room.


53
0:3:7,18 --> 0:3:9,8
Everyone would agree that I'm
already unique and casual, so


54
0:3:9,8 --> 0:3:12,86
I'm going to try chic
and modern.


55
0:3:12,86 --> 0:3:16,41
I'm going to choose this
sexy office lady here.


56
0:3:16,41 --> 0:3:18,97
And then I take the picture.


57
0:3:18,97 --> 0:3:20,295
Wow.


58
0:3:20,295 --> 0:3:24,6
It was just like the scene in
"Clueless." The end result is


59
0:3:24,6 --> 0:3:26,58
a bit disappointing, I'm
going to be honest.


60
0:3:26,58 --> 0:3:30,87



61
0:3:30,87 --> 0:3:32,85
The train is coming.


62
0:3:32,85 --> 0:3:44,73



63
0:3:44,73 --> 0:3:48,7
At some of the other places we
visited on this show, the


64
0:3:48,7 --> 0:3:49,69
actual fashion seemed to
be an afterthought


65
0:3:49,69 --> 0:3:52,38
to the event itself.


66
0:3:52,38 --> 0:3:55,73
Here, the fashion was everything
and was to be taken


67
0:3:55,73 --> 0:3:57,6
very seriously--


68
0:3:57,6 --> 0:4:0,35
on the catwalk, and
in the queue.


69
0:4:0,35 --> 0:4:4,7
Outside the fashion week, I felt
positively underdressed.


70
0:4:4,7 --> 0:4:7,65
In this series, I'd not yet been
to a place where the kids


71
0:4:7,65 --> 0:4:9,85
took their outfits
so seriously.


72
0:4:9,85 --> 0:4:12,71
Or indeed, seen so many
scrupulously crafted


73
0:4:12,71 --> 0:4:14,52
looks in one place.


74
0:4:14,52 --> 0:4:17,241
How would you describe your
own personal style?


75
0:4:17,241 --> 0:4:18,672
[SPEAKING KOREAN]


76
0:4:18,672 --> 0:4:26,7



77
0:4:26,7 --> 0:4:27,95
CHARLET DUBOC: And it
didn't end there.


78
0:4:27,95 --> 0:4:32,7
I spotted luminous pixies,
hipster [INAUDIBLE], fay time


79
0:4:32,7 --> 0:4:35,6
travelers, and even a punk.


80
0:4:35,6 --> 0:4:37,41
This is my new friend.


81
0:4:37,41 --> 0:4:41,1
You're the first person we've
seen in Seoul that has a


82
0:4:41,1 --> 0:4:42,71
vaguely punk look.


83
0:4:42,71 --> 0:4:45,26
Do you dress this way because
you listen to punk music, or


84
0:4:45,26 --> 0:4:47,66
do you dress this way because
you like punk fashion?


85
0:4:47,66 --> 0:4:50,87
[SPEAKING KOREAN]


86
0:4:50,87 --> 0:4:53,6
CHARLET DUBOC: Where I come
from, if people dress like


87
0:4:53,6 --> 0:4:56,85
you, it means that they follow
a punk rock lifestyle.


88
0:4:56,85 --> 0:4:59,18
And they believe in a kind of


89
0:4:59,18 --> 0:5:0,93
anti-establishment way of life.


90
0:5:0,93 --> 0:5:2,18
[SPEAKING KOREAN]


91
0:5:2,18 --> 0:5:7,532



92
0:5:7,532 --> 0:5:9,54
CHARLET DUBOC: It's been
lovely talking to you.


93
0:5:9,54 --> 0:5:11,33
You're the most polite
punk I've every met.


94
0:5:11,33 --> 0:5:13,83
You're a gentleman.


95
0:5:13,83 --> 0:5:17,2
The array of well-honed looks
may give the impression of


96
0:5:17,2 --> 0:5:18,89
alternative lifestyles.


97
0:5:18,89 --> 0:5:21,13
But the punk himself admitted
that his look


98
0:5:21,13 --> 0:5:22,38
was only skin deep.


99
0:5:22,38 --> 0:5:27,51



100
0:5:27,51 --> 0:5:31,49
To find out more, I went to see
a guy called Donald King,


101
0:5:31,49 --> 0:5:36,29
aka, "the loneliest rockabilly
punk in the world." I found


102
0:5:36,29 --> 0:5:38,94
him at his secret barber
shop, hidden in the


103
0:5:38,94 --> 0:5:41,67
back streets of Seoul.


104
0:5:41,67 --> 0:5:44,89
He looks like a terrifying
butcher--


105
0:5:44,89 --> 0:5:45,6
"Sweeney Todd."

112
0:6:21,218 --> 0:6:27,5



113
0:6:27,5 --> 0:6:30,677
Would you say it's difficult
to be a punk and maintain a


114
0:6:30,677 --> 0:6:31,671
punk scene?

116
0:6:32,921 --> 0:7:2,11



117
0:7:2,11 --> 0:7:5,6
CHARLET DUBOC: What do you think
of the mainstream Korean


118
0:7:5,6 --> 0:7:7,968
fashion industry in general?


119
0:7:7,968 --> 0:7:9,31

120
0:7:9,31 --> 0:7:13,355



121
0:7:13,355 --> 0:7:16,57
CHARLET DUBOC: K-pop, that's
what Korea's best known for


122
0:7:16,57 --> 0:7:18,27
culturally at the moment.


123
0:7:18,27 --> 0:7:19,66

0:7:20,91 --> 0:8:27,827



126
0:8:27,827 --> 0:8:30,79
CHARLET DUBOC: I left Don, the
lonely punk, with his heart


127
0:8:30,79 --> 0:8:34,86
hurting from the sound
of unstoppable K-pop.


128
0:8:34,86 --> 0:8:40,38
Hanryu, or Korean wave, refers
to all South Korean popular


129
0:8:40,38 --> 0:8:42,24
entertainment.


130
0:8:42,24 --> 0:8:45,62
The term was coined by Chinese
journalists taking note of the


131
0:8:45,62 --> 0:8:49,61
fast-growing popularity of
Korean pop culture in China.


132
0:8:49,61 --> 0:8:52,4
Thanks mainly to the internet,
which South


133
0:8:52,4 --> 0:8:53,445
Korea pretty much rules.


134
0:8:53,445 --> 0:8:57,67



135
0:8:57,67 --> 0:9:2,8
K-pop accounts for around 3.8
billion dollars worth of the


136
0:9:2,8 --> 0:9:3,44
country's economy.


137
0:9:3,44 --> 0:9:6,19
So whilst the girls and boys
might look like they're at it


138
0:9:6,19 --> 0:9:9,46
like rabbits, they're very
much investments to be


139
0:9:9,46 --> 0:9:13,76
protected from the wrong
kind of attention.


140
0:9:13,76 --> 0:9:18,5
We went to meet Ha Sang Beg,
celebrity designer and boy


141
0:9:18,5 --> 0:9:19,94
band stylist.


142
0:9:19,94 --> 0:9:22,42
He's somewhat of a controversial
figure on the


143
0:9:22,42 --> 0:9:26,2
Korean fashion scene, which
he seems to revel in.


144
0:9:26,2 --> 0:9:28,63
You need only go to his
website to see why.


145
0:9:28,63 --> 0:9:32,3



146
0:9:32,3 --> 0:9:35,12
Ha Sang has dabbled in
many fashion taboos.


147
0:9:35,12 --> 0:9:39,92
HA SANG BEG: I'm inspired by
the fetish, tie-up bondage.


148
0:9:39,92 --> 0:9:43,23
The helmet thing is breath
control inspired.


149
0:9:43,23 --> 0:9:45,15
CHARLET DUBOC: But it was after
his attempt to bring


150
0:9:45,15 --> 0:9:48,8
some androgyny into the world
of K-pop that shit


151
0:9:48,8 --> 0:9:49,33
really hit the fan.


152

HA SANG BEG: This is SHINee's
new album called "Sherlock."


154
0:9:58,7 --> 0:10:1,386
This is sort of ethnic
multicultural.


155
0:10:1,386 --> 0:10:3,41
CHARLET DUBOC: Yeah, it's
not what I would


156
0:10:3,41 --> 0:10:4,79
associate with K-pop.


157
0:10:4,79 --> 0:10:7,374
It's obviously like
an evolution.

This a member called
[INAUDIBLE].


165
0:10:15,98 --> 0:10:20,29
A lot of fans, in their
minds he's still like


166
0:10:20,29 --> 0:10:21,465
a good little boy.


167
0:10:21,465 --> 0:10:23,75
CHARLET DUBOC: And this
is quite sexual.


168
0:10:23,75 --> 0:10:23,65
HA SANG BEG: Yeah.


169
0:10:23,65 --> 0:10:28,39
After this, the fan from
Turkey said I really


170
0:10:28,39 --> 0:10:29,34
want to kill you.


171
0:10:29,34 --> 0:10:31,48

his innocence.


172

you do this?


173
0:10:33,91 --> 0:10:35,46
Nasty, nasty.


174
0:10:35,46 --> 0:10:37,8
It was so shocking to me.


175
0:10:37,8 --> 0:10:39,69
It was a very radical
reaction.


176
0:10:39,69 --> 0:10:41,36
CHARLET DUBOC: Do the fans
email you personally?


177
0:10:41,36 --> 0:10:42,506

178
0:10:42,506 --> 0:10:45,23
Oh, please, make them
wear the suit.


179
0:10:45,23 --> 0:10:52,7
One of those stage acts was a
very back revealing racerback.


180
0:10:52,7 --> 0:10:54,2
And then, what?


181
0:10:54,2 --> 0:10:57,246
CHARLET DUBOC: They thought
it was rude?


182
0:10:57,246 --> 0:10:58,49
HA SANG BEG: I don't know.


183
0:10:58,49 --> 0:11:1,42
The girls having fantasy,
I guess.


184
0:11:1,42 --> 0:11:4,16
CHARLET DUBOC: How do they know
that it's not the boys


185
0:11:4,16 --> 0:11:5,365
who have the control?


186
0:11:5,365 --> 0:11:8,37
I mean, how much control
do the boys have?


187
0:11:8,37 --> 0:11:14,12



188

I was keen to find out just how
sheltered these boys were.

0:11:18,4 --> 0:11:21,21
So we took up the chance to
partake in a press junket for


190
0:11:21,21 --> 0:11:23,23
an upcoming boy band.


191
0:11:23,23 --> 0:11:26,9
We've come up to the North of
Seoul, because we've been


192
0:11:26,9 --> 0:11:29,72
given this rare opportunity to
snatch five minutes with one


193
0:11:29,72 --> 0:11:32,95
of the hottest K-pop bands
in Korea at the moment.


194
0:11:32,95 --> 0:11:35,74
They're called Infinite,
they're a seven-piece.


195
0:11:35,74 --> 0:11:37,92
They're all babes about
half my age.


196
0:11:37,92 --> 0:11:40,97
And hopefully they can explain
some of their K-pop


197
0:11:40,97 --> 0:11:41,25
phenomenon.

0:11:42,5 --> 0:11:54,374



200
0:11:54,374 --> 0:11:56,51
CHARLET DUBOC: I've never done
one of these, and was


201
0:11:56,51 --> 0:12:0,29
immediately intimidated by the
strange interview format.


202
0:12:0,29 --> 0:12:3,99
I felt like I was about to
interview a school photo.


203
0:12:3,99 --> 0:12:6,89
So I'm basically
an alien here.


204

0:13:0,815 --> 0:13:5,765



222
0:13:5,765 --> 0:13:8,81
CHARLET DUBOC: Suddenly, one of
their team silently stepped


223
0:13:8,81 --> 0:13:12,28
in and ended the interview and
we were politely ushered out.


224
0:13:12,28 --> 0:13:16,13



225
0:13:16,13 --> 0:13:19,29
As K-pop makes a grab for
the world, will it


226
0:13:19,29 --> 0:13:21,4
like what it finds?


227
0:13:21,4 --> 0:13:25,77
The West loves success, but also

229
0:13:26,95 --> 0:13:30,9

231
0:13:32,925 --> 0:13:42,4



232
0:13:42,4 --> 0:13:46,2
It seemed curious that even the
very mention of girls was


233
0:13:46,2 --> 0:13:48,71
enough to end the interview

0:13:48,71 --> 0:13:55,77

0:13:55,77 --> 0:13:59,5
Sex in Seoul is a
tricky subject.


236
0:13:59,5 --> 0:14:2,41
Basically, until now, if you're
young you either find a


237
0:14:2,41 --> 0:14:6,36
dark alley or check yourselves
into a sex motel.


238
0:14:6,36 --> 0:14:10,4
Don't even think about taking
your boyfriend home unless you


239

tearfully impale

Here's where fashion comes
to the rescue again.

0:14:26,76 --> 0:14:29,3
wear matching underwear.


247
0:14:29,3 --> 0:14:32,475
Matching couples has been big
on the scene for some time,


248
0:14:32,475 --> 0:14:38,2
but now these couples want to
match all the way down.


249

This shop sells matching

Spirit of adventure.

0:14:44,71 --> 0:14:47,64
It's really weird.


252
0:14:47,64 --> 0:14:51,5
I mean, if my boyfriend and I

CHARLET DUBOC: We decided to
test this new trend by

0:15:24,87 --> 0:15:28,496
grabbing a couple for a spot
of market research.


262
0:15:28,496 --> 0:15:32,72

you'd like to match with each

0:28:47,2 --> 0:28:48,32
I look different from you.


456
0:28:48,32 --> 0:28:52,1
Because the whole idea is that
she wants my sort of look.


457
0:28:52,1 --> 0:28:55,39
And I didn't realize at the
time until someone told me


458

afterwards that me saying that
to her actually really


459

CHARLET DUBOC: One of the girls
at the fashion week said


471
0:29:26,735 --> 0:29:32,43
that having surgery done was no
different to choosing what


472
0:29:32,43 --> 0:29:36,36
dress to wear that day, or what
makeup to wear that day.


473
0:29:36,36 --> 0:29:39,32

clothes aren't quite as

it's a little bit more extreme
