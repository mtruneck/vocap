###9 NARRATOR: In February of 2012, university and college
###11 students in Quebec began striking against the 75%
###14 proposed tuition hike.
###17 Since the Quiet Revolution in the '60s, low tuition rates
###20 have been part of the socialist package deal
###21 promised to Quebecers.
###23 For student protesters, a doubling of current rates
###26 represents a complete abandonment of the fundamental
###27 ideals of their education system.
###30 To make matters worse, critics see the increase as being more
###32 to do with corruption than the spending within government,
###35 especially since Quebec has the highest income taxes in
###37 the country.
###39 Instead of balancing the books by attacking pensions and
###41 corporations, the government has seemingly attacked the
###44 weakest demographic in the province.
###46 Alienation and apathy has made the movement a rallying point
###49 for youth to rebel against a mostly non-responsive
###51 government, led by their Premier, Jean Charest.

###72 NARRATOR: Faced with fewer jobs, mounting personal debt,
###74 and the prospect of an aging boomer generation sucking
###77 public coffers dry, and you have a
###78 recipe for civil unrest.
###81 Some romantic types are even calling this Quebec's Spring.
###84 
###87 Things seemed destined to come to a head on May Day, as
###89 student unions were set to join other workers groups and
###92 the infamous anarchist black bloc in a crowd of close to
###94 10,000 behind Montreal City Hall.
###96 
###100 MARIE: May Day has a long revolutionary tradition.
###102 And we want to remind that to our [INAUDIBLE].
###105 It's about decent housing, decent lives, decent jobs.
###109 And it's about having people before profits.
###112 
###121 [CHANTING]
###127 NARRATOR: Once the spirited crowd took off, French
###129 anti-capitalists and "fuck the police" chants were
###131 everywhere, while some talked of riot squads.
###134 [CHANTING]
###155 NARRATOR: Eventually, they made their way to Saint
###157 Catherine Street, the heart of downtown Montreal, where after
###159 one window was broken, everything completely devolved
###162 into chaos.

###251 Shit!
###252 Fuck!

###262 NARRATOR: After an hour-long skirmish between cops and
###264 protesters, everyone regrouped in a downtown park to prepare
###268 for a night march.
###269 STUDENT: It turned pretty violent.
###272 People throwing rocks and stuff.
###274 It was predictable, kind of.
###276 Tonight, I don't know.
###278 So far, it's been pretty peaceful.
###280 I've been to a lot of demonstration at night, and it
###283 was peaceful.
###284 
###289 STUDENT: Every week, I think the end is here.
###291 Because every week, I see that the movement is very strong.
###295 But now I'm not sure.
###298 It's long.
###298 It's hard.
###300 But like you can see, it's not over.
###303 It's not over.
###303 So there's no reason that we're going to stop now.
###307 There's just no reason.
###308 You have to fight if you want something.
###310 You have to fight.
###313 NARRATOR: By the end of the day, over 100 people were
###315 arrested, with almost as many hospitalized.
###318 And since May Day, things have only gotten worse.
###320 
###324 Small towns have turned into temporary war zones.
###326 There's been smoke bombs in the Montreal metro system.
###328 And clashes between riot squads and
###330 protesters are daily.
###333 MAYOR TREMBLAY: What do you want me to do?
###335 Are we going to stop living?
###337 NARRATOR: The Quebec government even enacted a
###338 draconian anti-protest law, Bill 78.
###340 Which has only served to galvanize movement, and
###342 attract even more followers from all over the world,
###345 including the vigilante hacker group, Anonymous.
###347 The protest shows no signs of slowing down.
###350 In fact, at this point, Quebec is bracing itself for what may
###353 be the longest summer in its history.
