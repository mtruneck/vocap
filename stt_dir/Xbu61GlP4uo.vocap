###1 Life Wisdom. Psychetruth Massage.
###7 This is Athena Jezik and today we're going to work from the floor a
###11 little bit to benefit those of you that don't have a table or those of you that
###15 aren't in it professionally who just want to do it with your
###18 friends and family.
###20 One of the things
###22 that is important is that the person on the floor is comfortable some kind of a
###25 little padding or cushion
###27 is nice
###28 it's not a good idea necessarily to work from a bed because the bed sinks
###33 down and you don't get the nice solidness underneath. This is similar to the
###37 table.
###38 The other thing is I'm going to explain some what how that mechanics need to be for
###42 the person doing the massage because there is
###45 uh... it's a lot harder to work from the floor for the therapist.
###50 So we'll start with the back
###51 and um... basically i'm just on my knees
###55 
###58 So you'll be able to see how the body is going to work a little bit.
###67 this is where it's important to have good strength in your core if you're the one doing
###72 the work.
###79 Okay, just applying the oil...
###81 Now basically I work
###83 similar to what I would do from the table.
###90 So i'm gonna start up here and
###95 begin to work. Now here because there's no face cradle the neck is turned
###100 so the muscles are gonna be in a little bit different position. There will be a shortening and a lengthening
###104 
###104 but you can still basically work the same way
###108 spreading open the trapezius into the shoulder blades
###115 and you can glide down along side of the spine
###120 working through.
###124 Bringing your hands back up and spreading out and again.
###129 This is like a...
###131 I usually do this three times.
###138 No reason. Just
###139 that's what I do.
###141 I tend to move outside. I do one closer to the spine and then more in the
###145 middle of the muscle and then on the edge, so that's really where I get my "three" from.
###151 The neck is very differently placed when it's turned.
###155 So you'll be able to notice just how different that is. You can't really work the neck
###158 very well when it's turned.
###161 Okay so then to go down into this
###165 arms you have to reposition yourself by coming
###170 over to the side
###173 and then beginning to work
###175 outward in this direction.
###182 
###185 Around the shoulder blades. So all of this technique is really
###188 the same.. similar I should say
###192 to what you're doing.
###196 I can already feel in my body
###199 the strain
###202 of the different
###204 position that has to be done.
###212 It's best to be on your knees, if possible high on your knees so you can
###216 move your body around.
###218 There's a little bit of twisting that goes on.
###222 And then of course we can rub back upward.
###235 And then working back down
###239 sliding the hands
###242 and repositioning
###243 myself.
###244 Now here I tend to put my leg up because then I can get
###249 a little bit more
###253 of a
###255 direction on the
###257 muscles.
###258 It's a little bit easier to get when I'm higher
###262 than when I'm lower down.
###265 And working up
###271 again.
###282 And then
###286 to work across, lowering myself down.
###292 It's still staying fairly mobile.
###295 Still staying in a way that I can
###298 moves with the
###301 action of the massage work.
###310 So this is the basic
###313 routine that i've done
###315 many times over. I've been
###316 doing this same basic routine for my
###319 entire massage career. It's a good routine because it does cover
###324 everything. It moves from muscle to muscle very smoothly.
###331 And it just covers it all. It doesn't
###335 leave anything out and i do recommend that you find some routine that you can
###339 work because that way you get both sides of the body
###342 equally
###343 and if you have a routine, pretty soon that becomes very
###347 much
###348 part of
###349 what you do and you don't have to think too much so you can concentrate on
###353 sensations that are under your hands.
###356 That's how you begin to work and understand the body more
###360 on an intuitive level.
###363 So we are just working there
###365 and back up
###368 and down. Okay and then
###370 let's start to the other side
###376 same thing.
###383 and of course this routine is somewhat modified
###387 not a lot but there is some modifications happening here.
###435 
###438 Use the upper..pushing upward on these muscles near the hip.
###445 right along the hip edge
###453 and then up we go. This is another "threesome" thing that I do when I go up the spine.
###460 The spine has a little bit different movement when you're going upward or downward.
###481 And then coming back down and then working up across by her....
###485 across the erector spinae
###506 and then back up. Now for the vibration along the
###510 vertebrae...
###513 You won't be able to start up at the base of the skull, so you'll start down here, about
###517 C7.
###518 And vibrate down
###529 and then you can go back up
###535 
###536 vibrate down, up
###546 and again and vibrating down...
###552 and back up. This is a little bit different than what I normally do when I'm working from a
###557 table.
###561 Okay and I'm gonna switch to the other side and reach up here
###567 going between each vertebrae
###573 
###599 Down to the sacrum, the SI joint...
###605 And then on the floor I do the
###608 body wrapping from both sides
###611 just pushing down the...
###614 downward
###616 downward, down through the ribs
###627 and then you can wrap back up
###630 and up
###634 upward
###636 and upward...
###639 And a nice finish by just bringing it up.
###644 And then little brushes to sweep.
###647 Okay so i hope that gave you some ideas
###650 for working on the floor.
