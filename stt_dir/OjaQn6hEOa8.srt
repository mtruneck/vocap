This is Bob Marley here, 'nuff respect going
out to FoodTube.


2
0:0:6,299 --> 0:0:10,889
Me and Bob are gonna be making Jamaican Ginger
Cake. Your Nan loves it, little kids love it,


3
0:0:10,889 --> 0:0:15,16
everybody loves it, it's fantastic. You
can have it with butter, ice cream, or just


4
0:0:15,16 --> 0:0:20,2
on its own as a little cake. Beautiful. It
is such a great little dessert and its all


5
0:0:20,2 --> 0:0:26,7
the way from the Caribbean to rainy old England
so let's brighten up our day, shall we?!


6
0:0:26,7 --> 0:0:33,5
So, we've got some Golden Syrup. Now 125g
is what you need. Beautiful. Now I'm gonna


7
0:0:33,5 --> 0:0:37,41
put it all in first then I'm gonna put it
on a heat ok? So it's probably 3 of these


8
0:0:37,41 --> 0:0:43,72
big old spoons. I mean it is very, very naughty,
which is not a bad thing because it's a dessert


9
0:0:43,72 --> 0:0:49,29
and you deserve it.
Treacle! This stuff is lethal. Look at that!


10
0:0:49,29 --> 0:0:56,2
Wow! I wouldn't lick the spoon because you'll
probably pass out. Ha ha it's really sweet!


11
0:0:56,2 --> 0:1:2,0
A bit of Rum. 60ml of dark Rum. Now we've
got some sugar! Dark brown sugar. You can


12
0:1:2,0 --> 0:1:7,25
use a bit of Demerara if you like. So pop
that in. It just makes it really sort of a caramelly


13
0:1:7,25 --> 0:1:11,56
sort of flavour going on, rather than just
using normal caster sugar, ok.


14
0:1:11,56 --> 0:1:20,27
50ml of water in there. Unsalted butter, 125g,
get that in there. And I'm just gonna turn


15
0:1:20,27 --> 0:1:24,49
that on now.
Now, while that's melting you've got enough


16
0:1:24,49 --> 0:1:29,89
time to chop up your stemmed ginger. It's
in a lovely syrup so it's really sweet, so


17
0:1:29,89 --> 0:1:33,64
we're doing a dessert so it really does work.
You can buy it in the supermarket like this


18
0:1:33,64 --> 0:1:38,189
already. Roughly chop it because you want
those little bits of ginger in there. You


19
0:1:38,189 --> 0:1:43,59
don't want it to disappear completely.
In with the old stemmed ginger. Now that's


20
0:1:43,59 --> 0:1:47,909
ticking away nicely, you don't wanna boil
it. We only want this to tick away until the


21
0:1:47,909 --> 0:1:54,369
butter has melted and all the ingredients
have come together. Have a little taste. Aww


22
0:1:54,369 --> 0:2:0,689
that's marvellous! Honestly, it' so good!
Our cake or our bread needs to rise to the


23
0:2:0,689 --> 0:2:5,24
occasion so we need a bit of bicarbonate of
soda, 3/4 of a tsp there. I'll just pour that


24
0:2:5,24 --> 0:2:12,24
in there now. Alright, lovely. Flour, I've
sieved out 250g of the lovely plain flour.


25
0:2:12,24 --> 0:2:16,73
Now we're gonna add our spices. We've got
a tsp of ginger in there, half a tsp of all


26
0:2:16,73 --> 0:2:23,42
spices. That is the actual spice of Jamaica.
I've got half a tsp of nutmeg and 1 and a


27
0:2:23,42 --> 0:2:29,69
half of cinnamon. Alright, so in you go. Obviously
try and distribute it around. Mix it together.


28
0:2:29,69 --> 0:2:37,489
If you can find a smaller spoon, do so. What
am I doing?! Get a big one, why not!


29
0:2:37,489 --> 0:2:41,379
Beautiful! Now I'm just gonna crack 2 eggs
and whisk them up ok because the yolks are


30
0:2:41,379 --> 0:2:45,48
gonna add that nice richness and the whites
gonna help it rise up.


31
0:2:45,48 --> 0:2:54,7
Give it a whisky whisky, ok. We're gonna add
this lovely, naughty mixture into our eggs


32
0:2:54,7 --> 0:2:58,77
ok. But you gotta do a little bit at a time
because you don't want to scramble the eggs,


33
0:2:58,77 --> 0:3:1,959
do you know what I'm saying?! Once a little
bit's gone in there it sort of brings the


34
0:3:1,959 --> 0:3:8,769
temperature down. I'm just gonna whisk it
up a little bit, make sure it all comes together.


35
0:3:8,769 --> 0:3:14,66
Now we mix this into our flour. Make sure
you really do give it a good old whisk because


36
0:3:14,66 --> 0:3:18,72
you don't want any lumps in there. You can
see bubbles moving there. That's the bicarb.


37
0:3:18,72 --> 0:3:25,459
Can you see it working?!
Delicious! That is it.


38
0:3:25,459 --> 0:3:29,849
All we have to do now is bake it. So I've
got this nice little loaf tin over here. A


39
0:3:29,849 --> 0:3:35,99
little bit of butter inside and some greaseproof
paper, that's it. Now make sure your oven


40
0:3:35,99 --> 0:3:44,36
is preheated to 170°C. Let's introduce this
into the tin now. Here we go. Wow!


41
0:3:44,36 --> 0:3:48,69
Give it a little knock like that, make sure
the bubbles have gone out and it's distributed


42
0:3:48,69 --> 0:3:53,97
nicely in the tin. So there we go. That goes
into an oven at 170°C for about an hour and


43
0:3:53,97 --> 0:3:58,659
fifteen minutes.
An hour and fifteen minutes has passed! What


44
0:3:58,659 --> 0:4:4,599
Jamaicing? Ginger cake. Ooooh.
Let's see if it's ready. Boom, straight in


45
0:4:4,599 --> 0:4:11,86
the middle. Now this, should, in theory come
out nice and clear. Spot on every time. Look


46
0:4:11,86 --> 0:4:19,65
at that. Beautiful. If it's got a bit of goo
on it whack it back in for another 5-10 minutes.


47
0:4:19,65 --> 0:4:25,33
Yummy! I've had this on a cooling rack for
half an hour now. Beautiful! Look at that


48
0:4:25,33 --> 0:4:33,639
little baby there. You can see lovely, sticky
treacle in there. What better accompany than


49
0:4:33,639 --> 0:4:44,11
a nice bit of vanilla ice-cream. Look at that!
Praline, oooh yeah!


50
0:4:44,11 --> 0:4:52,279
What's that? He prefers it with butter, I
like it with ice-cream. Guys, go for it. Mmm


51
0:4:52,279 --> 0:5:0,199
really works with that ice-cream. Wooo, that's
lovely! Yep alright, in a minute.


52
0:5:0,199 --> 0:5:6,46
