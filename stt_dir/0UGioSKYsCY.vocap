###24 HAMILTON MORRIS: The next day, I go to visit Max Beauvoir, a
###27 man considered the voice of the vodou community.
###30 
###39 During Wade Davis' stay in Port-au-Prince, Beauvoir
###42 served as his guide and mentor.
###46 But in the years since, he's become the Supreme Chief of
###49 Haitian vodou
###55 MAX BEAUVOIR: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###56 HAMILTON MORRIS: Hello.
###56 MAX BEAUVOIR: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###57 How are you?
###58 HAMILTON MORRIS: Hamilton.
###59 Good.
###59 How are you?
###59 MAX BEAUVOIR: Very good.
###59 Glad to see you.
###60 Hello, please come on in.
###63 HAMILTON MORRIS: Beauvoir started
###64 his career as a scientist.
###66 MAX BEAUVOIR: Do not be afraid of my dog.
###68 HAMILTON MORRIS: Receiving a degree in biochemistry from
###71 the Sorbonne, and went on to investigate the medicinal
###74 plants of Haiti, patenting a method to isolate cortisone
###78 precursors from agave.
###81 Though he once straddled the material world of chemistry
###83 and the metaphysics of vodou, Beauvoir has abandoned his lab
###87 in favor of the temple in his own home, called Le Peristyle
###91 de Mariani.
###92 [DRUMMING]
###97 
###100 MAX BEAUVOIR: The Westerner is an arrogant person, by
###102 definition.
###103 And in his arrogance, he believes he can put his hands
###106 on whatever he wants and possess whatever he wants,
###110 including soul, including people.
###113 This is why he made slavery.
###114 This is why he made so many things.
###117 Being a zombie is not something physical that
###122 happened to you.
###123 It is something spiritual.
###125 A zombie is somebody who has misbehaved.
###129 In fact, somebody that in any other society they would call
###131 a criminal.
###132 Most likely, in other societies, this person would
###136 have been condemned to death.
###140 Our society, like every society, has decided that
###143 certain crimes are intolerable.
###147 Vodou doesn't believe in killing people.
###150 So in fact, this is why even that person considered a
###153 criminal is not killed.
###156 
###158 We move from him, or from her, that desire of
###163 committing bad deeds.
###166 And this is what zombification is all about.
###169 
###174 HAMILTON MORRIS: Max Beauvoir's explanation of
###177 zombification is unlike any other I've heard thus far.
###181 What he describes sounds strikingly similar to the use
###184 of antipsychotic drugs in Western medicine.
###187 But unlike pharmaceutical antipsychotics, the knowledge
###191 of the poison used to perform this sort of chemical lobotomy
###194 is controlled by an ancient secret society
###197 known as the Bizango.
###200 MAX BEAUVOIR: Bizango and also Sanpwel maintain social
###203 justice, maintain police and order in our society.
###208 HAMILTON MORRIS: So how would we go about meeting people in
###211 these societies?
###212 If a foreigner wanted to go and learn about it, how would
###214 they do that?
###216 MAX BEAUVOIR: I am the head of the Bizangos.
###218 HAMILTON MORRIS: Yes.
###219 
###227 Beauvoir suggests I travel to the mountains to find rural
###232 members of the Bizango society, who might be
###235 intimately acquainted with the secret powder.
###238 
###243 WADE DAVIS: All the time that I was working, both securing
###247 the powders in various locations and trying to
###250 understand what the nature of the zombie was, and so on and
###253 so forth, I kept brushing up against what I later came to
###258 understand to be the secret societies of Haiti, the
###261 Bizango Champwell, and that Narcisse had actually been
###263 brought before a tribunal of one of these societies and
###267 condemned for any number of transgressions.
###270 And in the end, I became initiated in these societies,
###274 certainly, if not the only, certainly one of the first
###278 outsiders ever to become initiated
###280 in the Bizango Champwell.
###282 HAMILTON MORRIS: Not long after vodou was recognized by
###285 whites, they began to fear its power.
###288 Slaves found practicing vodou were
###290 harshly punished or killed.
###293 Some slaves escaped their masters and formed colonies in
###297 the mountains, where they could practice their religious
###299 beliefs and live freely.
###302 They're known as the Maroons.
###304 It was the Maroons who organized the first
###307 small-scale slave uprisings, which culminated with the Bwa
###311 Kayiman vodou ceremony, in which all in attendance who
###315 vowed to kill their white masters were anointed with the
###318 blood of a slaughtered pig.
###320 This ceremony sparked the beginning of the 1791 Haitian
###325 revolution, led by Toussaint Louverture, and established
###328 Haiti as the first independent black republic.
###333 It was the Maroons who later became the
###335 Bizango secret societies.
###338 To some, the Bizango are a sort of benevolent spiritual
###341 police force.
###343 But to many Haitians, they are a feared band of cannibalistic
###347 criminals who feast on the unsuspecting during midnight
###350 expeditions.
###351 
###360 It is here that we meet Tomas, the bokor.
###364 A bokor is the Haitian equivalent of a sorcerer, or
###367 which doctor, shaman, or medicine man, a retailer of
###371 potions, a plant doctor, a man in direct contact with deep
###375 metaphysical realms.
###379 We enter the peristyle to find it's meticulously painted with
###383 hundreds of images of white people being stabbed in the
###386 neck by Satan, or being impaled by Satan while their
###390 blood is consumed by tricephalous snakes.
###395 There is also a Richard Avedon poster of Nastassja Kinski.
###400 On the ground are three large piles of glistening rock salt
###403 and an infant's coffin.
###404 
###407 It is here that we meet Tomas.
###409 
###411 Tomas is also the mayor of Ennery.
###414 
###417 Hello.
###418 TOMAS: My name is Tomas.
###419 HAMILTON MORRIS: I'm Hamilton.
###420 TOMAS: [INAUDIBLE].
###422 
###425 ALEX: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###426 TOMAS: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###427 
###438 ALEX: [SPEAKING CREOLE]

###443 TOMAS: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###444 ALEX: [SPEAKING CREOLE]

###451 TOMAS: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###455 ALEX: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###457 TOMAS: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###461 ALEX: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###463 
###467 TOMAS: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###469 ALEX: He says he won't tell you that.
###472 [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###473 TOMAS: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###475 
###477 ALEX: He said on Sunday he will make that for you.
###480 TOMAS: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###481 
###486 ALEX: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###488 TOMAS: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###489 ALEX: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###490 TOMAS: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###493 ALEX: He said $7,777.
###501 TOMAS: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###503 
###510 ALEX: He said Americans doesn't believe in Haitians.
###513 
###516 [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###517 
###533 TOMAS: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###535 
###544 ALEX: He said he will make it for you.
###549 [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###552 TOMAS: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###553 ALEX: So he said you have to give first.
###557 TOMAS: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###560 ALEX: So he said tomorrow night at the cemetery, he will
###564 make a zombie ceremony.
###566 And you will see zombie getting up.
###568 
###576 HAMILTON MORRIS: Nice to meet you.
###577 Thank you.
###578 TOMAS: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###582 OK.
###583 
###599 HAMILTON MORRIS: The next evening, we drive back into
###602 the mountains to meet Mayor Tomas at our designated
###606 midnight rendezvous.
###607 
###612 We enter the peristyle dedicated to the malevolent
###615 baron, and Alex walks in backwards to reverse any
###619 spells cast upon him by Tomas.
###621 
###625 He tells me Tomas is untrustworthy,
###628 a man without morals.
###629 
###635 TOMAS: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###636 
###644 ALEX: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###646 
###649 TOMAS: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###651 ALEX: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###653 
###661 TOMAS: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###662 
###704 HAMILTON MORRIS: Tomas, now incensed, pulls off his gold
###707 embroidered dashiki and puts on a baby blue gown with a
###710 scoop neck and two-button closure.
###712 
###716 As the associates of Tomas slowly gather around, Alex
###720 begins to back away, telling me that it's no longer safe.
###724 And we must return to our Mitsubishi Montero.
###728 
###734 He then calls his friend to arrange a meeting with a
###736 different bokor, deep in the rice fields of Artibonite.
###740 ALEX: [SPEAKING CREOLE]
###742 
###750 She just told me that she talked to the [INAUDIBLE], and
###756 everything we need, they will make it happen to us.
###761 So let's wait and see what happens tomorrow.
###763 
###775 HAMILTON MORRIS: At night, I experience a feverish dream of
###778 Jean-Claude van Damme, replete with hypnagogic
###782 hallucinations.
###784 He approaches me, knife in hand, and whispers in my ear,
###789 flicking my earlobe with his tongue, urging me to remember
###793 what Wade said about the cultural matrix.
###796
