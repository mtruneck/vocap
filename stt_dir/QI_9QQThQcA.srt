0:0:1,872 --> 0:0:3,58
ARTUR OLIVEIRA: Good
afternoon, everyone.


3
0:0:3,58 --> 0:0:5,51
Thank you all so much
for making it out.


4
0:0:5,51 --> 0:0:7,73
My name is Artur Oliveira.


5
0:0:7,73 --> 0:0:10,17
I'm on the authors
at Google team.


6
0:0:10,17 --> 0:0:14,791
And it is my pleasure to
introduce your speaker today.


7
0:0:14,791 --> 0:0:16,29
A lot of you might
be wondering what


8
0:0:16,29 --> 0:0:18,5
does serving great
guacamole have


9
0:0:18,5 --> 0:0:20,11
to do with eradicating poverty?


10
0:0:20,11 --> 0:0:21,7
And the thing is, I don't know.


11
0:0:21,7 --> 0:0:24,14
That's why we have
Josh Ruxin here,


12
0:0:24,14 --> 0:0:27,22
who is here today with us to
talk about his brand new book


13
0:0:27,22 --> 0:0:28,76
"A Thousand Hills
Through Heaven,


14
0:0:28,76 --> 0:0:32,159
Love, Hope, and a
Restaurant in Rwanda."


15
0:0:32,159 --> 0:0:34,43
Now, the "New York
Times" called it an


16
0:0:34,43 --> 0:0:36,14
observing and
affecting narrative.


17
0:0:36,14 --> 0:0:39,24
And the book has been receiving
a lot of praise recently,


18
0:0:39,24 --> 0:0:41,33
so this really is a treat.


19
0:0:41,33 --> 0:0:43,73
Josh is on faculty at
Columbia University,


20
0:0:43,73 --> 0:0:46,32
and he's been living
in Rwanda since 2005.


21
0:0:46,32 --> 0:0:48,94
So without further ado, if we
could please welcome up Josh.


22
0:0:48,94 --> 0:0:50,371
JOSH RUXIN: Thank you, Artur.


23
0:0:50,371 --> 0:0:51,802
[INAUDIBLE]


24
0:0:51,802 --> 0:0:55,15
Hi, everybody.


25
0:0:55,15 --> 0:0:58,91
So, this whole story actually
starts about 30 years ago.


26
0:0:58,91 --> 0:1:1,66
I was a high school
student at the height


27
0:1:1,66 --> 0:1:3,25
of the Ethiopian famine.


28
0:1:3,25 --> 0:1:5,17
I didn't really
know much about it.


29
0:1:5,17 --> 0:1:11,93
But there was a really
cute upper class woman


30
0:1:11,93 --> 0:1:15,65
who I saw go into some
meeting after school.


31
0:1:15,65 --> 0:1:17,75
And I thought, huh, I
wonder where she's going,


32
0:1:17,75 --> 0:1:20,63
so I followed her in
and started to learn


33
0:1:20,63 --> 0:1:25,83
about this incredible
catastrophe that was costing


34
0:1:25,83 --> 0:1:28,36
of course millions
of lives in Ethiopia.


35
0:1:28,36 --> 0:1:31,53
This was back 1984, 1985.


36
0:1:31,53 --> 0:1:34,28
And that was actually the very
beginning of my interest in it


37
0:1:34,28 --> 0:1:34,78
all.


38
0:1:34,78 --> 0:1:39,63
A couple years later, it
led to a trip to Ethiopia.


39
0:1:39,63 --> 0:1:40,94
I was just a teenager.


40
0:1:40,94 --> 0:1:43,87
I'd never been outside
of the country before,


41
0:1:43,87 --> 0:1:49,46
and ended up taking a little
plane to the middle of nowhere


42
0:1:49,46 --> 0:1:54,25
in northern Ethiopia, get out
of the plane on a grassy field.


43
0:1:54,25 --> 0:1:58,21
And everybody
dropped their plows


44
0:1:58,21 --> 0:2:1,76
and came over to look
at this white teenager


45
0:2:1,76 --> 0:2:2,9
from Connecticut.


46
0:2:2,9 --> 0:2:6,8
And a teacher came over
and started to translate


47
0:2:6,8 --> 0:2:9,8
and asked all the kids
who were gathered around,


48
0:2:9,8 --> 0:2:13,78
how do you think this kid and
the other students got here?


49
0:2:13,78 --> 0:2:17,37
And one kid raised his
hand and says, by mule?


50
0:2:17,37 --> 0:2:24,7
And then another kid points at
me and says, come, in Amharic.


51
0:2:24,7 --> 0:2:27,72
And so I end up walking with
these kids about a mile up


52
0:2:27,72 --> 0:2:30,5
to this mud-walled classroom.


53
0:2:30,5 --> 0:2:34,14
And there's a poster,
which has got pictures


54
0:2:34,14 --> 0:2:38,14
of this club from high school
from three years earlier


55
0:2:38,14 --> 0:2:42,68
that we had sent with an
aid worker years before.


56
0:2:42,68 --> 0:2:48,21
And that for me was that aha
moment that I'm sure all of you


57
0:2:48,21 --> 0:2:50,88
have had in one way or
another about how very, very


58
0:2:50,88 --> 0:2:54,43
small this planet is,
how you're only ever


59
0:2:54,43 --> 0:2:59,0
24 hours away from the
poorest places, the most


60
0:2:59,0 --> 0:3:0,41
desperate places.


61
0:3:0,41 --> 0:3:2,96
And I decided then,
hey, I want to make


62
0:3:2,96 --> 0:3:4,15
some sort of contribution.


63
0:3:4,15 --> 0:3:6,54
I want to figure out how
to make a difference.


64
0:3:6,54 --> 0:3:8,11
And the next 30
years have been spent


65
0:3:8,11 --> 0:3:10,65
trying to figure out
how the heck to do that,


66
0:3:10,65 --> 0:3:16,7
because it's not as easy as
just having your heart into it.


67
0:3:16,7 --> 0:3:23,6
So, about eight years ago, now
nine years ago, my wife and I


68
0:3:23,6 --> 0:3:24,77
were just about to be married.


69
0:3:24,77 --> 0:3:29,94
And we were given a very
unusual sendoff gift.


70
0:3:29,94 --> 0:3:36,41
A very wealthy donor and
fundraiser said to us, hey,


71
0:3:36,41 --> 0:3:39,5
I've seen a really
interesting poverty reduction


72
0:3:39,5 --> 0:3:41,77
program in Kenya and
some other places,


73
0:3:41,77 --> 0:3:45,0
but it's not happening in
Rwanda, and it should be.


74
0:3:45,0 --> 0:3:49,6
So why don't you, Josh, and
with your new wife Alissa,


75
0:3:49,6 --> 0:3:53,17
head to Rwanda and get it going.


76
0:3:53,17 --> 0:3:57,19
At that time, my wife had
a public health degree


77
0:3:57,19 --> 0:3:58,35
from Harvard.


78
0:3:58,35 --> 0:4:1,35
She was sick and tired of taking
the subway down to Wall Street,


79
0:4:1,35 --> 0:4:4,35
where she was running a
executive public health


80
0:4:4,35 --> 0:4:6,96
program at Goldman Sachs.


81
0:4:6,96 --> 0:4:9,6
And she said, sure, let's go.


82
0:4:9,6 --> 0:4:11,79
We'll go for a year or two.


83
0:4:11,79 --> 0:4:13,5
And we never came back.


84
0:4:13,5 --> 0:4:16,829



85
0:4:16,829 --> 0:4:22,3
We got to Rwanda just 10
years after the genocide.


86
0:4:22,3 --> 0:4:26,36
And I'm sure when most of
you think about Rwanda,


87
0:4:26,36 --> 0:4:28,98
that is what you think
about, the "Hotel


88
0:4:28,98 --> 0:4:33,99
Rwanda," the senseless
horrible slaughter of over


89
0:4:33,99 --> 0:4:38,63
a million people in a
hundred days back in 1994.


90
0:4:38,63 --> 0:4:42,25
But we actually
arrived in a country


91
0:4:42,25 --> 0:4:48,4
that, while it certainly bore
the scars of the genocide,


92
0:4:48,4 --> 0:4:52,1
was clean, secure,
beautiful, with wonderful,


93
0:4:52,1 --> 0:4:55,26
welcoming people that was
very much on the move.


94
0:4:55,26 --> 0:4:58,4
It was actually even
then growing at rates


95
0:4:58,4 --> 0:5:0,83
that would make this
administration very jealous,


96
0:5:0,83 --> 0:5:4,84
nearly double-digit economic
growth rates every year.


97
0:5:4,84 --> 0:5:9,45
So I arrived to start working
at the Millennium Village


98
0:5:9,45 --> 0:5:12,595
site, which is just down
south of Kigali in a place


99
0:5:12,595 --> 0:5:13,22
called Mayange.


100
0:5:13,22 --> 0:5:18,21
And it was not booming.


101
0:5:18,21 --> 0:5:22,97
It actually was suffering
from a horrible famine.


102
0:5:22,97 --> 0:5:25,85
The health center as
I found it back then,


103
0:5:25,85 --> 0:5:29,4
this was actually the
ambulance at the health center.


104
0:5:29,4 --> 0:5:30,39
Most days it was shut.


105
0:5:30,39 --> 0:5:32,78
The doors were just not open.


106
0:5:32,78 --> 0:5:35,44
And I asked, how
do you get a nurse?


107
0:5:35,44 --> 0:5:37,405
And they said, well,
you can go find her


108
0:5:37,405 --> 0:5:39,89
if you've got money
to go find her.


109
0:5:39,89 --> 0:5:45,23
And then compounding everything,
the land had no topsoil.


110
0:5:45,23 --> 0:5:47,64
All the topsoil had
rolled down the hills


111
0:5:47,64 --> 0:5:49,44
because of deforestation.


112
0:5:49,44 --> 0:5:51,52
And people were
literally starving


113
0:5:51,52 --> 0:5:55,47
because they couldn't
produce enough food to eat.


114
0:5:55,47 --> 0:5:58,43
So with my colleagues, we
started at the very beginning,


115
0:5:58,43 --> 0:6:1,879
which was, as long as people
are dying from starvation,


116
0:6:1,879 --> 0:6:3,92
no one's really going to
want to listen to a word


117
0:6:3,92 --> 0:6:5,7
that we have to say.


118
0:6:5,7 --> 0:6:8,59
So we started working on
progressive terracing and line


119
0:6:8,59 --> 0:6:9,68
planting.


120
0:6:9,68 --> 0:6:11,68
And pretty soon,
those very hills--


121
0:6:11,68 --> 0:6:15,16
this is a picture taken
from the same exact angle--


122
0:6:15,16 --> 0:6:18,27
started to green up and
started to produce food.


123
0:6:18,27 --> 0:6:21,62
And that was actually
the very first harvest.


124
0:6:21,62 --> 0:6:23,37
That ended up
changing everything,


125
0:6:23,37 --> 0:6:28,68
because lots of our thinking
around building community


126
0:6:28,68 --> 0:6:31,15
grew out of the
notion that you need


127
0:6:31,15 --> 0:6:33,76
to have an integrated
set of interventions


128
0:6:33,76 --> 0:6:38,8
in order to reduce
poverty ultimately.


129
0:6:38,8 --> 0:6:44,15
And I'll never
forget, one day, one


130
0:6:44,15 --> 0:6:47,97
of the early adopters in the
community-- who this might well


131
0:6:47,97 --> 0:6:47,93
have been her field.


132
0:6:47,93 --> 0:6:48,75
I can't remember.


133
0:6:48,75 --> 0:6:51,3
Her name's Jacqueline-- she
came up to me, and she said,


134
0:6:51,3 --> 0:6:54,51
you know, Josh, I'm
really angry with you,


135
0:6:54,51 --> 0:6:58,5
because for years I was
the funeral director here.


136
0:6:58,5 --> 0:7:0,68
And we had deaths all the time.


137
0:7:0,68 --> 0:7:3,4
And I actually made
a decent living


138
0:7:3,4 --> 0:7:4,75
directing those funerals.


139
0:7:4,75 --> 0:7:7,33
But you've put me
out of business.


140
0:7:7,33 --> 0:7:9,88
No one dies here anymore.


141
0:7:9,88 --> 0:7:12,89
And that was the moment that
the whole community really


142
0:7:12,89 --> 0:7:17,41
started to take over its
development interventions,


143
0:7:17,41 --> 0:7:18,81
completely own it.


144
0:7:18,81 --> 0:7:22,58
And today, we've basically
scaled down that project.


145
0:7:22,58 --> 0:7:27,22
And if it's any sign
of the reduction


146
0:7:27,22 --> 0:7:29,7
if not virtual
elimination of poverty,


147
0:7:29,7 --> 0:7:32,43
the real estate prices
have gone up fivefold


148
0:7:32,43 --> 0:7:36,862
since the bottom in 2005 when
people were literally just


149
0:7:36,862 --> 0:7:39,7
leaving because there was
no reason to be in Mayange.


150
0:7:39,7 --> 0:7:42,8



151
0:7:42,8 --> 0:7:44,44
Oh, that's Jacqueline,
by the way.


152
0:7:44,44 --> 0:7:47,1



153
0:7:47,1 --> 0:7:51,0
So meanwhile, my
wife was in Kigali,


154
0:7:51,0 --> 0:7:55,63
and she was working with
the orphans of the genocide.


155
0:7:55,63 --> 0:8:1,4
And she was working on a
program called Generation Rwanda


156
0:8:1,4 --> 0:8:3,86
helping some of
these kids get access


157
0:8:3,86 --> 0:8:5,47
to scholarships for university.


158
0:8:5,47 --> 0:8:9,74
But the vast majority didn't
have access to scholarships.


159
0:8:9,74 --> 0:8:11,59
There weren't enough
donors to pay for them.


160
0:8:11,59 --> 0:8:18,22
And Alissa had a huge insight,
which was these kids need jobs.


161
0:8:18,22 --> 0:8:20,13
And with jobs,
they're going to be


162
0:8:20,13 --> 0:8:22,99
able to put themselves
through university.


163
0:8:22,99 --> 0:8:24,43
I said, great, honey.


164
0:8:24,43 --> 0:8:26,144
What do you propose?


165
0:8:26,144 --> 0:8:28,6
She said, well, how about
we just open a cafe?


166
0:8:28,6 --> 0:8:31,56
There's no good place to get
a cup of coffee around here.


167
0:8:31,56 --> 0:8:35,46
So, being a supportive husband,
I said, that sounds great.


168
0:8:35,46 --> 0:8:38,95
I had this vision
of plastic chairs,


169
0:8:38,95 --> 0:8:43,46
and plastic tables, and maybe
a really nice espresso maker.


170
0:8:43,46 --> 0:8:49,17
And then some investors
put millions of dollars


171
0:8:49,17 --> 0:8:55,23
behind a Starbucks-style
cafe in Kigali.


172
0:8:55,23 --> 0:8:58,77
And she said, OK,
second thought,


173
0:8:58,77 --> 0:9:0,27
let's do something different.


174
0:9:0,27 --> 0:9:4,307
Let's build the best gourmet
restaurant in East Africa.


175
0:9:4,307 --> 0:9:5,89
So this is actually
the building site.


176
0:9:5,89 --> 0:9:8,38
Alissa found this land.


177
0:9:8,38 --> 0:9:13,13
It's literally just two blocks
away from the famed hotel


178
0:9:13,13 --> 0:9:16,23
Rwanda, the Hotel
des Mille Collines.


179
0:9:16,23 --> 0:9:20,51
And this is construction
back in 2007


180
0:9:20,51 --> 0:9:24,36
when my wife was pregnant
with our first child.


181
0:9:24,36 --> 0:9:28,54
And this is the construction
of the magnificent deck


182
0:9:28,54 --> 0:9:33,0
overlooking all of Kigali.


183
0:9:33,0 --> 0:9:36,31
And eventually Heaven emerged.


184
0:9:36,31 --> 0:9:39,38
That's what it looks like
today just before service.


185
0:9:39,38 --> 0:9:42,57
Most nights we have a lot more
customers than in that picture.


186
0:9:42,57 --> 0:9:46,46



187
0:9:46,46 --> 0:9:55,85
And it's been an incredibly
rewarding but on a daily basis


188
0:9:55,85 --> 0:9:59,22
hugely challenging endeavor.


189
0:9:59,22 --> 0:10:3,5
From the very beginning, most of
our servers, most of our chefs,


190
0:10:3,5 --> 0:10:5,87
most everyone who
works at Heaven


191
0:10:5,87 --> 0:10:8,3
had never had a job
before and had never


192
0:10:8,3 --> 0:10:11,46
even set foot in a restaurant.


193
0:10:11,46 --> 0:10:16,2
So the training element of
this hospitality business


194
0:10:16,2 --> 0:10:17,81
has not gone away.


195
0:10:17,81 --> 0:10:21,21
In fact, we have rotating
chefs and rotating


196
0:10:21,21 --> 0:10:22,28
front-of-house managers.


197
0:10:22,28 --> 0:10:26,97
So if anyone has any friends out
there, every six months or so,


198
0:10:26,97 --> 0:10:30,21
people cycle through, usually
from the States and Europe,


199
0:10:30,21 --> 0:10:34,354
to really invest in
the team at Heaven.


200
0:10:34,354 --> 0:10:35,77
I can send you the
job description


201
0:10:35,77 --> 0:10:37,47
if you're interested.


202
0:10:37,47 --> 0:10:44,17
So what does, I mean
as Artur set this up,


203
0:10:44,17 --> 0:10:46,3
what does serving
up great guacamole


204
0:10:46,3 --> 0:10:50,406
or great filet mignon have
to do with poverty reduction?


205
0:10:50,406 --> 0:10:51,78
That was something
that I started


206
0:10:51,78 --> 0:10:56,24
to figure out very early
on in the enterprise.


207
0:10:56,24 --> 0:11:0,51
One of our first cleaners
was a woman named Solange.


208
0:11:0,51 --> 0:11:3,63
Solange, I don't even
think I knew her name back


209
0:11:3,63 --> 0:11:5,62
in 2008 when we opened up.


210
0:11:5,62 --> 0:11:10,55
And one day Alissa found
Solange in the kitchen,


211
0:11:10,55 --> 0:11:13,98
like around 11:00 or
so, preparing food.


212
0:11:13,98 --> 0:11:15,88
But she was the cleaner.


213
0:11:15,88 --> 0:11:18,83
And Alissa came
home, and she said,


214
0:11:18,83 --> 0:11:21,38
you won't believe who was
in the kitchen cooking.


215
0:11:21,38 --> 0:11:22,51
I said, who?


216
0:11:22,51 --> 0:11:24,37
She said the cleaner was.


217
0:11:24,37 --> 0:11:25,38
This is ridiculous.


218
0:11:25,38 --> 0:11:27,15
We've got to sit
down with the staff.


219
0:11:27,15 --> 0:11:28,94
We've got to sit
down with the chefs.


220
0:11:28,94 --> 0:11:33,22
Why are they pawning off
the work onto Solange?


221
0:11:33,22 --> 0:11:38,45
So that night, we sat down with
the whole kitchen staff just


222
0:11:38,45 --> 0:11:40,6
before service.


223
0:11:40,6 --> 0:11:42,93
And I said, what
are you all doing?


224
0:11:42,93 --> 0:11:45,57
Why was Solange in here cooking?


225
0:11:45,57 --> 0:11:50,95
And they replied, well, she
was just making staff meal.


226
0:11:50,95 --> 0:11:52,95
I said, yeah, but
that's your job.


227
0:11:52,95 --> 0:11:56,83
They said, yeah, but
she's the best cook.


228
0:11:56,83 --> 0:12:0,88
So Solange today is actually
the sous chef at Heaven.


229
0:12:0,88 --> 0:12:3,77
She's worked under
Michelin-star chefs.


230
0:12:3,77 --> 0:12:7,91
She makes the best squash
risotto you've ever tasted.


231
0:12:7,91 --> 0:12:12,5
She can knock out without
even planning for it--


232
0:12:12,5 --> 0:12:14,42
for some reason, when
people come into Heaven,


233
0:12:14,42 --> 0:12:16,2
they don't make reservations.


234
0:12:16,2 --> 0:12:19,2
So people will think
nothing of walking


235
0:12:19,2 --> 0:12:24,59
into this restaurant in
Central Africa with 30 people


236
0:12:24,59 --> 0:12:27,42
and expecting world-class
service and world-class food.


237
0:12:27,42 --> 0:12:31,37
And Solange is actually able
to knock those meals right out


238
0:12:31,37 --> 0:12:33,53
of the kitchen with no problem.


239
0:12:33,53 --> 0:12:37,6



240
0:12:37,6 --> 0:12:40,34
That's Heaven by
night out on the deck.


241
0:12:40,34 --> 0:12:42,54
That's Solange.


242
0:12:42,54 --> 0:12:44,96
Solange, by the way, is
the very first member


243
0:12:44,96 --> 0:12:48,92
of her entire family
to go to university.


244
0:12:48,92 --> 0:12:52,63
There's about a dozen
kids and family at home


245
0:12:52,63 --> 0:12:55,1
who are completely
supported by her income.


246
0:12:55,1 --> 0:12:56,71
She pays for their health care.


247
0:12:56,71 --> 0:13:0,2
She pays for their education.


248
0:13:0,2 --> 0:13:5,2
And yet Solange doesn't receive
a charitable contribution.


249
0:13:5,2 --> 0:13:11,3
She doesn't receive a
501(c)(3) annual check.


250
0:13:11,3 --> 0:13:14,5
She's working for pay.


251
0:13:14,5 --> 0:13:19,6
And that lesson about
financial sustainability


252
0:13:19,6 --> 0:13:22,42
really changed my
outlook about how


253
0:13:22,42 --> 0:13:25,23
to think about what I've been
doing in the public health


254
0:13:25,23 --> 0:13:26,6
sector.


255
0:13:26,6 --> 0:13:28,787
So in public health, I've
got this organization


256
0:13:28,787 --> 0:13:29,745
called Health Builders.


257
0:13:29,745 --> 0:13:33,64
You can check it out,
globalhealthbuilders.org.


258
0:13:33,64 --> 0:13:34,59
And we do two things.


259
0:13:34,59 --> 0:13:39,49
We actually take lessons
from Heaven in accounting,


260
0:13:39,49 --> 0:13:41,78
and human resources,
and in management.


261
0:13:41,78 --> 0:13:43,64
We go into health centers.


262
0:13:43,64 --> 0:13:46,6
We help them improve these
public health centers


263
0:13:46,6 --> 0:13:49,28
to the point where they
are cash flow positive.


264
0:13:49,28 --> 0:13:51,94
They're real
functional businesses.


265
0:13:51,94 --> 0:13:54,34
And then we do
something landmark.


266
0:13:54,34 --> 0:13:57,83
We actually let them go.


267
0:13:57,83 --> 0:14:1,0
Because that's one of the keys
to doing development right


268
0:14:1,0 --> 0:14:3,97
is knowing when
you've done your job


269
0:14:3,97 --> 0:14:8,23
and when everyone can
take over and manage


270
0:14:8,23 --> 0:14:10,84
the future of the health
center or the restaurant.


271
0:14:10,84 --> 0:14:13,47
Though we're not
there yet with Heaven.


272
0:14:13,47 --> 0:14:17,97
And this is an example
of that thinking


273
0:14:17,97 --> 0:14:20,58
around financial
sustainability put to use.


274
0:14:20,58 --> 0:14:25,24
This is a health center right
up by the mountain gorillas up


275
0:14:25,24 --> 0:14:27,1
in the northern
part of the country.


276
0:14:27,1 --> 0:14:30,67
It was co-financed by a
donor, a very generous donor,


277
0:14:30,67 --> 0:14:33,55
and by local funds.


278
0:14:33,55 --> 0:14:38,47
So we put together a public
contract and built it.


279
0:14:38,47 --> 0:14:42,67
And then we trained the staff
up and opened the doors.


280
0:14:42,67 --> 0:14:45,32
There's no plaque there
that says Health Builders.


281
0:14:45,32 --> 0:14:48,91
It is a government of
Rwanda health facility,


282
0:14:48,91 --> 0:14:52,1
and it runs on its own.


283
0:14:52,1 --> 0:14:54,62
So that's really
the way that I see


284
0:14:54,62 --> 0:14:56,69
the future of
development happening


285
0:14:56,69 --> 0:15:0,94
is that in countries
like Rwanda, where


286
0:15:0,94 --> 0:15:2,93
the government cares
about the public's health


287
0:15:2,93 --> 0:15:6,85
and really cares about real
development and poverty


288
0:15:6,85 --> 0:15:10,92
eradication, it's going to
be between the public sector


289
0:15:10,92 --> 0:15:12,36
and the private sector.


290
0:15:12,36 --> 0:15:16,17
The very first night
that Heaven opened,


291
0:15:16,17 --> 0:15:17,98
my country director
for the health work


292
0:15:17,98 --> 0:15:21,4
is a guy named [INAUDIBLE]
Carabucci, huge guy,


293
0:15:21,4 --> 0:15:21,98
really tall.


294
0:15:21,98 --> 0:15:23,4
He says he's 6 foot 6.


295
0:15:23,4 --> 0:15:26,11
I think he's over 7 feet.


296
0:15:26,11 --> 0:15:33,3
And he walks in, looks out
over 150 customers in Heaven,


297
0:15:33,3 --> 0:15:39,2
grabs my wife, and says,
we don't need aid anymore.


298
0:15:39,2 --> 0:15:42,43
We don't need donor
assistance anymore in Rwanda.


299
0:15:42,43 --> 0:15:46,18
What we need is a
thousand Heavens.


300
0:15:46,18 --> 0:15:48,46
We actually need
lots of businesses


301
0:15:48,46 --> 0:15:50,95
like this that are investing
in management training, that


302
0:15:50,95 --> 0:15:52,599
are generating salaries.


303
0:15:52,599 --> 0:15:54,39
That's what's going to
change this country.


304
0:15:54,39 --> 0:15:56,95
That's what's going
to change the world.


305
0:15:56,95 --> 0:15:57,72
And actually that
was the working title


306
0:15:57,72 --> 0:16:0,29
for a while for the book.


307
0:16:0,29 --> 0:16:6,21
So, I know that a lot of
people often ask me, well,


308
0:16:6,21 --> 0:16:7,307
how do I have impact?


309
0:16:7,307 --> 0:16:8,39
I want to become a doctor.


310
0:16:8,39 --> 0:16:9,431
I want to become a nurse.


311
0:16:9,431 --> 0:16:11,42
Or I want to go to
public health school


312
0:16:11,42 --> 0:16:14,7
because I want to
make a difference.


313
0:16:14,7 --> 0:16:19,11
And my top-level
advice on that front


314
0:16:19,11 --> 0:16:23,99
is, you don't have to do those
things in order to have impact.


315
0:16:23,99 --> 0:16:28,14
And for that matter, you
don't have to become a martyr,


316
0:16:28,14 --> 0:16:32,54
sacrifice yourself, in
order to have huge impact.


317
0:16:32,54 --> 0:16:35,11
I think that's a little bit
of the conventional wisdom


318
0:16:35,11 --> 0:16:37,29
is you've got to
give everything up


319
0:16:37,29 --> 0:16:41,18
in order to reduce poverty
and have social impact.


320
0:16:41,18 --> 0:16:43,78
And our experience has
been much different.


321
0:16:43,78 --> 0:16:45,14
We have a good life.


322
0:16:45,14 --> 0:16:48,13
We've got three kids.


323
0:16:48,13 --> 0:16:52,36
We have high stress, high
anxiety, just like everybody


324
0:16:52,36 --> 0:16:53,83
does with their jobs.


325
0:16:53,83 --> 0:16:59,35
But we feel really
lucky to live in Rwanda


326
0:16:59,35 --> 0:17:2,59
and to have the opportunity
to make a contribution


327
0:17:2,59 --> 0:17:6,52
in a way that is dignifying
and in a way that


328
0:17:6,52 --> 0:17:10,55
is led by the Rwandan
people and by our friends.


329
0:17:10,55 --> 0:17:13,359
So with that I wanted to
open it up to all of you


330
0:17:13,359 --> 0:17:17,64
and have a little bit of a
discussion about this very


331
0:17:17,64 --> 0:17:18,609
large restaurant.


332
0:17:18,609 --> 0:17:19,95
We can seat up to 200.


333
0:17:19,95 --> 0:17:24,0
In fact, there were 200 people
in last night, called Heaven.


334
0:17:24,0 --> 0:17:26,8
AUDIENCE: So, it's a high-end
restaurant, and it's serving,


335
0:17:26,8 --> 0:17:28,65
I'm assuming, wealthier people.


336
0:17:28,65 --> 0:17:31,53
Are the people that mostly
come in native Rwandans


337
0:17:31,53 --> 0:17:32,6
or more tourists?


338
0:17:32,6 --> 0:17:33,84
JOSH RUXIN: It's a split.


339
0:17:33,84 --> 0:17:36,44
So, about a third
of our clientele


340
0:17:36,44 --> 0:17:41,25
are tourists who have come to
see the gorillas in the mist.


341
0:17:41,25 --> 0:17:44,44
And about a third are expats.


342
0:17:44,44 --> 0:17:46,61
There's over 3,000
Americans, for example,


343
0:17:46,61 --> 0:17:48,16
who live in Kigali.


344
0:17:48,16 --> 0:17:54,1
And about a third are Rwandans,
mainly higher class Rwandans.


345
0:17:54,1 --> 0:17:57,93
But if it's Mother's
Day, if it's a birthday,


346
0:17:57,93 --> 0:18:3,34
if it's Christmas Eve or New
Year's, it is a total mix,


347
0:18:3,34 --> 0:18:6,56
and it's almost all Rwandese.


348
0:18:6,56 --> 0:18:10,39
Rwandans actually-- this has
been a real challenge for us--


349
0:18:10,39 --> 0:18:13,73
don't have a culture of food.


350
0:18:13,73 --> 0:18:15,79
And eating was
actually something


351
0:18:15,79 --> 0:18:18,5
done at home, done
behind closed doors.


352
0:18:18,5 --> 0:18:20,53
Maybe that grew out of
the scarcity of food


353
0:18:20,53 --> 0:18:22,27
over generations.


354
0:18:22,27 --> 0:18:29,59
And so you will find Rwandese
who drive in Porsche Cayennes,


355
0:18:29,59 --> 0:18:32,65
but they insist
on eating at home.


356
0:18:32,65 --> 0:18:37,74
So it's been a challenge for
us to really teach and educate


357
0:18:37,74 --> 0:18:41,589
the market about great food
and what that tastes like.


358
0:18:41,589 --> 0:18:43,38
AUDIENCE: And then,
just a quick follow-up,


359
0:18:43,38 --> 0:18:45,63
I guess what I was
wondering is did you


360
0:18:45,63 --> 0:18:48,78
get any backlash in terms of
having people lift themselves


361
0:18:48,78 --> 0:18:52,39
out of poverty but also with
this kind of contrasting


362
0:18:52,39 --> 0:18:55,624
high-end restaurant,
so the idea of people


363
0:18:55,624 --> 0:18:57,4
taking jobs to
lift themselves out


364
0:18:57,4 --> 0:19:1,96
of poverty by serving people
that are wealthier than them?


365
0:19:1,96 --> 0:19:2,99
JOSH RUXIN: No.


366
0:19:2,99 --> 0:19:5,69
AUDIENCE: I mean just in
terms of a class issue.


367
0:19:5,69 --> 0:19:7,15
JOSH RUXIN: No, I
don't think over


368
0:19:7,15 --> 0:19:9,41
the years we've ever
seen that class issue.


369
0:19:9,41 --> 0:19:12,67
AUDIENCE: So the focus is just
really positive on the job


370
0:19:12,67 --> 0:19:14,522
creation and everything
that's going on?


371
0:19:14,522 --> 0:19:15,48
JOSH RUXIN: Absolutely.


372
0:19:15,48 --> 0:19:15,816
AUDIENCE: That's awesome.


373
0:19:15,816 --> 0:19:16,49
JOSH RUXIN: Yes.


374
0:19:16,49 --> 0:19:17,74
AUDIENCE: I have two question.


375
0:19:17,74 --> 0:19:20,46
The first one, you mentioned
that you left to Rwanda


376
0:19:20,46 --> 0:19:22,355
and never came back.


377
0:19:22,355 --> 0:19:23,98
So the first question
is, what happened


378
0:19:23,98 --> 0:19:26,755
with the rest of your family,
extended family, friends?


379
0:19:26,755 --> 0:19:27,63
Were they supportive?


380
0:19:27,63 --> 0:19:29,9
JOSH RUXIN: Oh, the
family back here--


381
0:19:29,9 --> 0:19:29,875
AUDIENCE: Yes, exactly.


382
0:19:29,875 --> 0:19:31,8
JOSH RUXIN: Oh yeah, I
was just about to say,


383
0:19:31,8 --> 0:19:32,827
that whole family's
in Kigali right now.


384
0:19:32,827 --> 0:19:34,66
AUDIENCE: No, exactly,
that's the first one.


385
0:19:34,66 --> 0:19:37,9
And the second one is that
because of those connection,


386
0:19:37,9 --> 0:19:40,94
maybe, did they help
either via donation


387
0:19:40,94 --> 0:19:43,36
or some of your friends decided
to go there and help you?


388
0:19:43,36 --> 0:19:45,31
Or did they just
say, hey, good luck.


389
0:19:45,31 --> 0:19:46,78
We wish you the best.


390
0:19:46,78 --> 0:19:50,8
JOSH RUXIN: Well, we are
not independently wealthy


391
0:19:50,8 --> 0:19:52,73
and when we were
building Heaven ran


392
0:19:52,73 --> 0:19:54,83
into cost overruns,
cost overruns.


393
0:19:54,83 --> 0:19:57,1
We had actually taken
out a second mortgage


394
0:19:57,1 --> 0:19:59,84
on our apartment back in New
York City, which of course we


395
0:19:59,84 --> 0:20:2,53
had had every
intention to return to.


396
0:20:2,53 --> 0:20:4,79
And then we burned through
that second mortgage


397
0:20:4,79 --> 0:20:7,83
and then contacted
our immediate family


398
0:20:7,83 --> 0:20:10,54
and asked them to help us
out and write some checks.


399
0:20:10,54 --> 0:20:12,33
And then we burned
through all that.


400
0:20:12,33 --> 0:20:15,45
And we were feeling very
sheepish before even opening


401
0:20:15,45 --> 0:20:18,35
the doors and turned
to friends and had


402
0:20:18,35 --> 0:20:20,7
them write checks,
not as donations.


403
0:20:20,7 --> 0:20:23,6
And over the course of
the first two years,


404
0:20:23,6 --> 0:20:26,64
we actually paid off all
the friends and family,


405
0:20:26,64 --> 0:20:31,2
and then just last year paid
off the rest of the debt.


406
0:20:31,2 --> 0:20:33,38
So that's the debt
situation, which isn't really


407
0:20:33,38 --> 0:20:35,87
what your question
was referring to.


408
0:20:35,87 --> 0:20:38,62
In terms of family
and their reaction,


409
0:20:38,62 --> 0:20:40,786
they come and they visit.


410
0:20:40,786 --> 0:20:44,23
They always expected
that we would come back.


411
0:20:44,23 --> 0:20:47,28
But here's something
interesting,


412
0:20:47,28 --> 0:20:50,59
which is, when I started
working in development


413
0:20:50,59 --> 0:20:53,3
back when I graduated
from university,


414
0:20:53,3 --> 0:20:55,45
I remember this
is the early '90s,


415
0:20:55,45 --> 0:20:57,16
and I was living in Bolivia.


416
0:20:57,16 --> 0:21:3,48
And I would receive a letter
and read the letter every day


417
0:21:3,48 --> 0:21:6,42
for a month and a half
until I got another letter.


418
0:21:6,42 --> 0:21:9,47



419
0:21:9,47 --> 0:21:12,95
And my kids on a
weekly basis get


420
0:21:12,95 --> 0:21:16,23
to use Skype video with
their grandparents.


421
0:21:16,23 --> 0:21:18,82
I get to see my
friends all the time.


422
0:21:18,82 --> 0:21:22,79
It is completely transformed
what that experience is.


423
0:21:22,79 --> 0:21:26,73
Literally distance
has been destroyed.


424
0:21:26,73 --> 0:21:30,405
And it's so much easier than
it ever was before to do it.


425
0:21:30,405 --> 0:21:33,12
Of course, when I tell
my wife that who's


426
0:21:33,12 --> 0:21:37,77
about to board 32
hours of transport


427
0:21:37,77 --> 0:21:41,9
with the three kids this
Friday evening, she says,


428
0:21:41,9 --> 0:21:42,3
no, it's not any easier.


429
0:21:42,3 --> 0:21:46,4
Can't we just go on holiday
break in the neighborhood?


430
0:21:46,4 --> 0:21:49,77
But outside of
that, the families


431
0:21:49,77 --> 0:21:51,89
have been incredibly supportive.


432
0:21:51,89 --> 0:21:52,97
And they love Rwanda.


433
0:21:52,97 --> 0:21:56,43
I mean, everyone has
fallen in love with Rwanda.


434
0:21:56,43 --> 0:21:59,49
It really is this
incredible jewel.


435
0:21:59,49 --> 0:22:3,34
And I think they all see
our hope, and our dream,


436
0:22:3,34 --> 0:22:5,73
and our imagination,
which is, let's not


437
0:22:5,73 --> 0:22:8,62
leave all the great things
in Rwanda in Rwanda.


438
0:22:8,62 --> 0:22:9,94
Let's expand it.


439
0:22:9,94 --> 0:22:12,5
Let's expand the health
work to other countries.


440
0:22:12,5 --> 0:22:14,82
Let's expand Heaven
to other places.


441
0:22:14,82 --> 0:22:18,35
Actually Alissa opened up a
little boutique guest house


442
0:22:18,35 --> 0:22:19,23
just last year.


443
0:22:19,23 --> 0:22:21,84
It's been one of the best
parts of the whole business,


444
0:22:21,84 --> 0:22:24,48
and she wants to expand
it to create more jobs


445
0:22:24,48 --> 0:22:30,255
and hospitality to really get
a feel for the whole spectrum


446
0:22:30,255 --> 0:22:34,71
of what international
consumers are looking for.


447
0:22:34,71 --> 0:22:37,73
AUDIENCE: So you hear a
lot in Uganda and Nigeria


448
0:22:37,73 --> 0:22:40,72
about sort of the problem
with brain drain and people


449
0:22:40,72 --> 0:22:43,65
having aspirations to leave
the country for education


450
0:22:43,65 --> 0:22:46,784
and maybe having
intentions to come back.


451
0:22:46,784 --> 0:22:48,2
I know Rwanda's a
little different


452
0:22:48,2 --> 0:22:50,605
with the recent history,
but how is the education


453
0:22:50,605 --> 0:22:51,23
infrastructure?


454
0:22:51,23 --> 0:22:55,2
Do a lot of people want to
leave Rwanda for education?


455
0:22:55,2 --> 0:22:56,27
JOSH RUXIN: They certainly do.


456
0:22:56,27 --> 0:23:1,6
But first off, Rwanda is
a tale of exceptionalism


457
0:23:1,6 --> 0:23:6,19
because the genocide
didn't just happen in 1994.


458
0:23:6,19 --> 0:23:9,47
You've got to go back to
1959 to see its roots.


459
0:23:9,47 --> 0:23:13,12
And from 1959 to 1994, you
had hundreds of thousands


460
0:23:13,12 --> 0:23:15,67
of people who left the country.


461
0:23:15,67 --> 0:23:18,52
Some lived in refugee camps
in Uganda and elsewhere.


462
0:23:18,52 --> 0:23:23,79
But some made their way to the
States, to the UK, to Belgium.


463
0:23:23,79 --> 0:23:28,22
They got educated, and as
soon as the war was over


464
0:23:28,22 --> 0:23:31,68
and the genocide was over,
they started coming back in.


465
0:23:31,68 --> 0:23:34,2
And so you literally
had this case


466
0:23:34,2 --> 0:23:35,93
of the reverse of brain drain.


467
0:23:35,93 --> 0:23:37,61
You had incredibly
skilled people


468
0:23:37,61 --> 0:23:40,1
who were exposed to
the outside world.


469
0:23:40,1 --> 0:23:42,32
Bear in mind, you
saw the map before.


470
0:23:42,32 --> 0:23:43,41
Rwanda is landlocked.


471
0:23:43,41 --> 0:23:44,39
There's no poor.


472
0:23:44,39 --> 0:23:46,34
It was never on a spice route.


473
0:23:46,34 --> 0:23:48,92
And so critically,
that is in part


474
0:23:48,92 --> 0:23:53,4
where the prosperity
and the future of Rwanda


475
0:23:53,4 --> 0:23:56,54
has been pinned, all these
people who actually came back


476
0:23:56,54 --> 0:23:58,945
with real knowledge
about what's going


477
0:23:58,945 --> 0:24:1,57
on in the outside world, what's
happening in technology, what's


478
0:24:1,57 --> 0:24:3,15
happening in business.


479
0:24:3,15 --> 0:24:7,69
So today what
happens, certainly, I


480
0:24:7,69 --> 0:24:12,0
know lots of students who have
gone abroad and stayed abroad.


481
0:24:12,0 --> 0:24:16,11
But I also know a whole lot who
have gone abroad and come back


482
0:24:16,11 --> 0:24:19,76
for jobs in tech
and jobs in banking.


483
0:24:19,76 --> 0:24:22,39
I wish they would come
back for jobs at Heaven,


484
0:24:22,39 --> 0:24:26,4
because that level of
management is really needed.


485
0:24:26,4 --> 0:24:27,416
It's needed at Heaven.


486
0:24:27,416 --> 0:24:28,79
It's needed in
the health sector.


487
0:24:28,79 --> 0:24:30,98
It's needed in all those areas.


488
0:24:30,98 --> 0:24:32,27
And it is building.


489
0:24:32,27 --> 0:24:36,79
But Rwanda is essentially
a new country, so reborn


490
0:24:36,79 --> 0:24:38,89
just 19 years ago.


491
0:24:38,89 --> 0:24:41,78
The 20th anniversary is
coming up of the genocide.


492
0:24:41,78 --> 0:24:45,31
And I think a lot of
people with Mandela's death


493
0:24:45,31 --> 0:24:47,73
are starting to think
about that and remember,


494
0:24:47,73 --> 0:24:51,8
oh yeah, when Nelson Mandela
was elected president-- that


495
0:24:51,8 --> 0:24:55,42
was in April 1994--
all eyes were on that


496
0:24:55,42 --> 0:24:58,89
while the genocide was
unfolding in Rwanda.


497
0:24:58,89 --> 0:25:0,64
And I think that
it's unfortunate


498
0:25:0,64 --> 0:25:5,7
that we look to Africa now, and
we think about Mandela's legacy


499
0:25:5,7 --> 0:25:8,21
and overlook the fact
that one of the best


500
0:25:8,21 --> 0:25:11,26
stories of leadership, and
growth, and prosperity,


501
0:25:11,26 --> 0:25:13,365
and stability on
the entire continent


502
0:25:13,365 --> 0:25:17,26
and in the entire world is
up to the north in the place


503
0:25:17,26 --> 0:25:18,916
that I call home.


504
0:25:18,916 --> 0:25:22,49
AUDIENCE: Hi, I just want to
say I was in Rwanda in 2008,


505
0:25:22,49 --> 0:25:23,74
and I went to your restaurant.


506
0:25:23,74 --> 0:25:24,28
JOSH RUXIN: Thank you
for being a patron.


507
0:25:24,28 --> 0:25:26,696
AUDIENCE: And it was one of
the most memorable experiences


508
0:25:26,696 --> 0:25:28,3
I had in Africa.


509
0:25:28,3 --> 0:25:30,63
And I also wondered if you
had any experience starting


510
0:25:30,63 --> 0:25:34,74
restaurants in the US and if
you ran into any reluctance


511
0:25:34,74 --> 0:25:37,444
from the local people about an
American starting a business.


512
0:25:37,444 --> 0:25:39,61
Because when I was there,
I was under the impression


513
0:25:39,61 --> 0:25:41,77
it was an African-owned
restaurant.


514
0:25:41,77 --> 0:25:45,0
Because we were told
it was run by orphans.


515
0:25:45,0 --> 0:25:47,81
And it didn't have the
feeling of an American


516
0:25:47,81 --> 0:25:50,607
or a foreign-owned business.


517
0:25:50,607 --> 0:25:51,94
JOSH RUXIN: That's good to hear.


518
0:25:51,94 --> 0:25:54,75
I guess I wasn't
working that night.


519
0:25:54,75 --> 0:25:59,84
So, I suppose if we had had
any restaurant experience,


520
0:25:59,84 --> 0:26:2,717
we might not have been so
naive as to have gotten


521
0:26:2,717 --> 0:26:4,3
into this business
in the first place.


522
0:26:4,3 --> 0:26:6,11
It's the world's
hardest business.


523
0:26:6,11 --> 0:26:12,4
And Alissa outside of a
short stint as a barista


524
0:26:12,4 --> 0:26:16,61
had no experienced in
any related industry.


525
0:26:16,61 --> 0:26:18,37
I actually was
always the one who


526
0:26:18,37 --> 0:26:20,5
wore the apron in
the relationship.


527
0:26:20,5 --> 0:26:23,35
She's cooked, in the
course of our marriage


528
0:26:23,35 --> 0:26:27,4
and our relationship,
exactly one meal for me.


529
0:26:27,4 --> 0:26:29,139
And that was very early on.


530
0:26:29,139 --> 0:26:30,68
I've done all the
cooking ever since.


531
0:26:30,68 --> 0:26:32,54
And in the early
days, I actually


532
0:26:32,54 --> 0:26:35,3
did a lot of the cooking
and a lot of the training


533
0:26:35,3 --> 0:26:36,59
back in the kitchen.


534
0:26:36,59 --> 0:26:37,67
I love food.


535
0:26:37,67 --> 0:26:38,83
I love cooking.


536
0:26:38,83 --> 0:26:40,19
I am not a chef.


537
0:26:40,19 --> 0:26:42,1
I recognize my
shortcomings, and that's


538
0:26:42,1 --> 0:26:44,25
why we started bringing
on international chefs


539
0:26:44,25 --> 0:26:45,61
to think about the management.


540
0:26:45,61 --> 0:26:49,1
And there's so much to
think about in terms


541
0:26:49,1 --> 0:26:51,3
of inventory and planing.


542
0:26:51,3 --> 0:26:57,63
And as Americans in Rwanda
starting up a business


543
0:26:57,63 --> 0:27:1,44
and starting up a
restaurant, we were embraced.


544
0:27:1,44 --> 0:27:4,21
I mean, it took no
more than 48 hours


545
0:27:4,21 --> 0:27:5,4
to incorporate the business.


546
0:27:5,4 --> 0:27:8,2



547
0:27:8,2 --> 0:27:10,484
Anyone, any one of you
can come to Rwanda.


548
0:27:10,484 --> 0:27:11,9
If you've got a
business idea, you


549
0:27:11,9 --> 0:27:15,27
can literally go to the
Rwanda Development Board,


550
0:27:15,27 --> 0:27:17,3
incorporate your
business, and get moving.


551
0:27:17,3 --> 0:27:19,26
It is effortless there.


552
0:27:19,26 --> 0:27:22,56
So they really are
welcoming private investment


553
0:27:22,56 --> 0:27:25,89
and bringing entrepreneurial
skills and management


554
0:27:25,89 --> 0:27:27,59
to the country.


555
0:27:27,59 --> 0:27:29,635
AUDIENCE: So you said
you weren't there yet


556
0:27:29,635 --> 0:27:35,78
in terms of handing off
Heaven to be owned maybe


557
0:27:35,78 --> 0:27:38,19
by the people that work there.


558
0:27:38,19 --> 0:27:39,58
Are there plans to do that?


559
0:27:39,58 --> 0:27:40,56
What's the timeline?


560
0:27:40,56 --> 0:27:43,67
What does that look like?


561
0:27:43,67 --> 0:27:46,35
JOSH RUXIN: Well, I think we're
in an interesting position


562
0:27:46,35 --> 0:27:46,92
right now.


563
0:27:46,92 --> 0:27:53,12
The restaurant and the
inn are doing well.


564
0:27:53,12 --> 0:27:56,63
But it still does take an
enormous amount of effort


565
0:27:56,63 --> 0:28:0,32
from my wife, and on a really
busy night from both of us.


566
0:28:0,32 --> 0:28:2,58
It's sort of still all
hands on deck because


567
0:28:2,58 --> 0:28:4,83
of the unpredictability
of the business.


568
0:28:4,83 --> 0:28:11,57
And it's very hard to build that
management set in Heaven staff


569
0:28:11,57 --> 0:28:13,68
and bring them up to
that management level.


570
0:28:13,68 --> 0:28:17,4
We're constantly working on
that and aiming for that.


571
0:28:17,4 --> 0:28:19,45
And I think one of
the solutions for it


572
0:28:19,45 --> 0:28:23,6
is Heaven actually needs to
grow to be a little bit bigger


573
0:28:23,6 --> 0:28:27,91
as a business in order to
have international trainers


574
0:28:27,91 --> 0:28:30,67
constantly on board,
constantly on staff,


575
0:28:30,67 --> 0:28:34,19
so that we can move
on and do other things


576
0:28:34,19 --> 0:28:37,68
and not be as engaged in
day-to-day management.


577
0:28:37,68 --> 0:28:40,53
That said, compared
to back in 2008,


578
0:28:40,53 --> 0:28:44,12
when Alyssa and I would be
at the restaurant until 1:00


579
0:28:44,12 --> 0:28:45,96
in the morning
every single night,


580
0:28:45,96 --> 0:28:50,13
and then I went to my day job,
which was in public health.


581
0:28:50,13 --> 0:28:53,67
Compared to those days,
we are very, very far


582
0:28:53,67 --> 0:28:57,21
advanced and much, much
closer to the realization


583
0:28:57,21 --> 0:28:58,82
of that sustainability.


584
0:28:58,82 --> 0:29:1,556
But the restaurant business
is a little tricky.


585
0:29:1,556 --> 0:29:3,43
It doesn't matter where
you are in the world.


586
0:29:3,43 --> 0:29:5,71
You know when the
owner is not around.


587
0:29:5,71 --> 0:29:8,75
That's just the
nature of the beast.


588
0:29:8,75 --> 0:29:12,7
And I hope that we can
really get to that point.


589
0:29:12,7 --> 0:29:18,63
At the same time, Heaven has
become this incredible platform


590
0:29:18,63 --> 0:29:21,35
for Alissa in particular
to build out her ideas.


591
0:29:21,35 --> 0:29:25,49
So last Saturday, she hosted
on that beautiful terrace


592
0:29:25,49 --> 0:29:29,1
the very first farmers
market in Rwanda's history


593
0:29:29,1 --> 0:29:32,68
and got all sorts of
organic growers and people


594
0:29:32,68 --> 0:29:34,41
producing really
interesting products


595
0:29:34,41 --> 0:29:36,43
to come in and do that.


596
0:29:36,43 --> 0:29:39,29
There's theater that
happens that she brings in


597
0:29:39,29 --> 0:29:40,62
and art exhibitions.


598
0:29:40,62 --> 0:29:44,54
And so it's a lot more than just
dishing up food and dishing up


599
0:29:44,54 --> 0:29:46,21
a great customer experience.


600
0:29:46,21 --> 0:29:48,8
It's also about serving
as a real cultural venue


601
0:29:48,8 --> 0:29:52,61
to show off all the great things
that are happening in Rwanda.


602
0:29:52,61 --> 0:29:54,86
AUDIENCE: So I was actually
born and raised in Kigali,


603
0:29:54,86 --> 0:29:56,41
and I'm half Rwandan.


604
0:29:56,41 --> 0:29:58,779
And I went to your
restaurant in 2011.


605
0:29:58,779 --> 0:29:59,57
It was really good.


606
0:29:59,57 --> 0:30:2,7
And I want to thank you
for spreading the gospel.


607
0:30:2,7 --> 0:30:5,32
But my question was, you
have mentioned many times


608
0:30:5,32 --> 0:30:9,7
how exceptionally run Rwanda
was and how safe it is.


609
0:30:9,7 --> 0:30:12,68
What are your thoughts
on aid for places


610
0:30:12,68 --> 0:30:16,44
that aren't run like Rwanda?


611
0:30:16,44 --> 0:30:18,65
JOSH RUXIN: So as you
will read in the book,


612
0:30:18,65 --> 0:30:21,31
I have pretty
strong views on this


613
0:30:21,31 --> 0:30:25,92
that when you think about
aid and the level of aid,


614
0:30:25,92 --> 0:30:28,96
for example, of the US
government in Rwanda,


615
0:30:28,96 --> 0:30:31,63
it's been well placed
and well positioned.


616
0:30:31,63 --> 0:30:36,36
Rwanda is famous for having some
of the world's lowest levels


617
0:30:36,36 --> 0:30:37,66
of corruption.


618
0:30:37,66 --> 0:30:40,71
And I'm all for
that kind of aid.


619
0:30:40,71 --> 0:30:43,71
Because when the
government in particular


620
0:30:43,71 --> 0:30:47,81
cares about the public's health
and the public's development--


621
0:30:47,81 --> 0:30:49,28
you haven't been
there since 2011?


622
0:30:49,28 --> 0:30:50,196
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].


623
0:30:50,196 --> 0:30:54,34
JOSH RUXIN: Wi-Fi is on the
public buses now in Kigali.


624
0:30:54,34 --> 0:30:57,85
It's just extraordinary
the ambition of the place.


625
0:30:57,85 --> 0:31:1,1
But I've worked in so
many other countries


626
0:31:1,1 --> 0:31:4,44
where government
officials have asked me


627
0:31:4,44 --> 0:31:8,14
for bribes, where I felt as
though the work of Health


628
0:31:8,14 --> 0:31:11,19
Builders just could
not take off because


629
0:31:11,19 --> 0:31:14,2
of the corruption of
the public sector.


630
0:31:14,2 --> 0:31:17,7
And in a world where
realistically, we've


631
0:31:17,7 --> 0:31:21,43
got finite resources,
sadly, for doing things


632
0:31:21,43 --> 0:31:24,42
like public health,
I would much rather


633
0:31:24,42 --> 0:31:28,89
see those funds channeled to
countries like Rwanda that


634
0:31:28,89 --> 0:31:34,12
have a plan for sustainability,
that have a plan for not


635
0:31:34,12 --> 0:31:36,83
accepting donor
aid in the future


636
0:31:36,83 --> 0:31:40,5
in building out a tax base
to do it on their own.


637
0:31:40,5 --> 0:31:43,2
And I get enraged
when I see countries


638
0:31:43,2 --> 0:31:47,38
which have the resources, have
the means, have the wealth


639
0:31:47,38 --> 0:31:49,53
and just aren't
doing it and yet are


640
0:31:49,53 --> 0:31:51,8
receiving big chunks of aid.


641
0:31:51,8 --> 0:31:59,28
As a humanitarian, I'm compelled
and feel enormous sympathy


642
0:31:59,28 --> 0:32:1,61
for the poor.


643
0:32:1,61 --> 0:32:4,3
But at the same time,
I feel as though we


644
0:32:4,3 --> 0:32:6,52
need better systems
and better milestones


645
0:32:6,52 --> 0:32:9,18
in order to get the
governments to take


646
0:32:9,18 --> 0:32:14,24
this type of development on, and
internalize it, and build out


647
0:32:14,24 --> 0:32:16,69
what has happened in Rwanda.


648
0:32:16,69 --> 0:32:20,61
In my book, I refer
to five lessons.


649
0:32:20,61 --> 0:32:24,83
And my lesson about what to
say to those countries that


650
0:32:24,83 --> 0:32:27,69
are incredibly corrupt
that are looking for aid


651
0:32:27,69 --> 0:32:29,207
relates to the middle finger.


652
0:32:29,207 --> 0:32:30,79
AUDIENCE: So you
said in the beginning


653
0:32:30,79 --> 0:32:34,15
there was no local cuisine
because people just


654
0:32:34,15 --> 0:32:35,61
don't eat out.


655
0:32:35,61 --> 0:32:36,56
What is your cuisine?


656
0:32:36,56 --> 0:32:38,3
And what have you done
to maybe tease out


657
0:32:38,3 --> 0:32:40,89
the locals to participate?


658
0:32:40,89 --> 0:32:43,33
JOSH RUXIN: So we've done
a combination of things.


659
0:32:43,33 --> 0:32:46,53
So the main local cuisine
when Rwandese go out


660
0:32:46,53 --> 0:32:51,34
for a traditional meal, it might
be goat brochette, rice, beans,


661
0:32:51,34 --> 0:32:53,95
relatively simple
food with piri piri,


662
0:32:53,95 --> 0:32:57,96
really spicy sauce,
and also maybe


663
0:32:57,96 --> 0:33:1,52
some matoke in a tomato sauce.


664
0:33:1,52 --> 0:33:4,77
We have a very eccentric menu.


665
0:33:4,77 --> 0:33:7,81
We have got probably our
signature dish, which


666
0:33:7,81 --> 0:33:11,47
has been on the menu now since
we opened, is our filet mignon.


667
0:33:11,47 --> 0:33:15,32
You want to talk about
green, pasture-fed cows,


668
0:33:15,32 --> 0:33:19,477
I mean, you're not going to find
more sustainably raised cattle


669
0:33:19,477 --> 0:33:20,81
than what you'll find in Rwanda.


670
0:33:20,81 --> 0:33:22,37
It is a fabulous piece of beef.


671
0:33:22,37 --> 0:33:25,24
And then we smother it in a
cassava chimichurri sauce.


672
0:33:25,24 --> 0:33:27,47
So we take cassava
leaves, which are often


673
0:33:27,47 --> 0:33:33,82
served as a local food in
the form of a sombe, which


674
0:33:33,82 --> 0:33:35,12
is with palm oil.


675
0:33:35,12 --> 0:33:37,91
And we do it with olive
oil, some garlic, and onion.


676
0:33:37,91 --> 0:33:40,38
And then sometimes we'll
actually take the matoke.


677
0:33:40,38 --> 0:33:41,66
We'll take cream.


678
0:33:41,66 --> 0:33:44,34
We'll take green bananas,
and we'll mash them up


679
0:33:44,34 --> 0:33:46,56
with some butter
instead of potatoes.


680
0:33:46,56 --> 0:33:52,18
So it has these local
flavors, but it is clearly


681
0:33:52,18 --> 0:33:54,63
an international dish.


682
0:33:54,63 --> 0:33:56,79
And then I got to
confess, probably


683
0:33:56,79 --> 0:33:59,3
our most popular
dessert over the years


684
0:33:59,3 --> 0:34:2,95
has always been our
molten chocolate brownie


685
0:34:2,95 --> 0:34:5,12
with our homemade ice cream.


686
0:34:5,12 --> 0:34:8,34
Anyway, well, it is so great to
be here with all of you today.


687
0:34:8,34 --> 0:34:11,29
And I want to welcome
you to Heaven.


688
0:34:11,29 --> 0:34:12,605
Come on in.


689
0:34:12,605 --> 0:34:15,1
You can have a mojito on me.


690
0:34:15,1 --> 0:34:19,88
And come out to Rwanda, and
come have the experience


691
0:34:19,88 --> 0:34:23,59
of seeing this country that
has so much to show the world.


692
0:34:23,59 --> 0:34:25,56
Lots of people say,
oh, can I come on,


693
0:34:25,56 --> 0:34:28,32
and can I volunteer for
two weeks or three weeks?


694
0:34:28,32 --> 0:34:30,28
And I say, don't
think that you need


695
0:34:30,28 --> 0:34:32,57
to come out as a
volunteer to have impact.


696
0:34:32,57 --> 0:34:35,76
You can have impact by
coming out as a tourist,


697
0:34:35,76 --> 0:34:37,62
spending money,
eating in Heaven,


698
0:34:37,62 --> 0:34:41,21
eating in other restaurants,
giving good customer feedback,


699
0:34:41,21 --> 0:34:43,739
and spreading the word.


700
0:34:43,739 --> 0:34:48,909
Because that is a massive source
of national income is tourism.


701
0:34:48,909 --> 0:34:51,739
That really is one of
the top still growing


702
0:34:51,739 --> 0:34:53,31
exports in the country.


703
0:34:53,31 --> 0:34:57,5
So that is a great
way to be helpful.


704
0:34:57,5 --> 0:34:59,4
Thank you so much.


705
0:34:59,4 --> 0:36:59,4
