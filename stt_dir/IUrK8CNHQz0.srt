0:0:6,0 --> 0:0:47,12
# One two, Middlesboogie #


2
0:0:47,12 --> 0:0:55,96
Tim, Tim. Tim !


3
0:0:55,96 --> 0:1:35,8
# Na na na-na na na na na #


4
0:1:35,8 --> 0:1:37,32
# Happy birthday to you


5
0:1:37,32 --> 0:1:38,96
# Happy birthday to you


6
0:1:38,96 --> 0:1:43,4
# Happy birthday, dear Daisy,
happy birthday to you #


7
0:1:43,4 --> 0:1:46,48
'Happy birthday, darling.
I thought I'd catch you.


8
0:1:46,48 --> 0:1:48,76
'It's such a shame I won't see you


9
0:1:48,76 --> 0:1:52,16
'but I'm really hoping you'll
come to Auntie Irene's 40th.


10
0:1:52,16 --> 0:1:55,0
'It'll probably
be the 15th now. Oh, no.


11
0:1:55,0 --> 0:1:56,76
'The 23rd of this month.


12
0:1:56,76 --> 0:2:0,92
'Not this month now, this month
coming. So... next month.


13
0:2:0,92 --> 0:2:5,4
'So let me know. Aunt Susie's
out of hospital, such a relief.


14
0:2:5,4 --> 0:2:8,8
'It was going to be today... '


15
0:2:8,8 --> 0:2:15,32
'... and it was yesterday,
I thought you'd want to know.'


16
0:2:15,32 --> 0:2:20,84
# Happy birthday to you,
happy birthday to you


17
0:2:20,84 --> 0:2:23,6
# Happy birthday


18
0:2:23,6 --> 0:2:28,48
# Happy birthday to you,
happy birthday to you


19
0:2:28,48 --> 0:2:31,76
# Happy birthday #


20
0:2:31,76 --> 0:2:34,8
Thank you very much.


21
0:2:34,8 --> 0:2:35,96
For what ?


22
0:2:35,96 --> 0:2:37,36
For my birthday song.


23
0:2:37,36 --> 0:2:41,36
Oh, is it your birthday ?


24
0:2:41,36 --> 0:2:43,4
How are you feeling this morning ?


25
0:2:43,4 --> 0:2:44,96
Very rough, actually.


26
0:2:44,96 --> 0:2:48,2
I swear to God I will never
drink again until lunchtime.


27
0:2:48,2 --> 0:2:49,64
- Very wise.
- Hmm.


28
0:2:49,64 --> 0:2:51,84
So how does it feel to be 26 ?


29
0:2:51,84 --> 0:2:53,68
- Bit gassy.
- Well, getting old.


30
0:2:53,68 --> 0:2:56,52
You'd be dead in four years,
if this was Logan's Run.


31
0:2:56,52 --> 0:2:59,56
- That'd be terrible.
- I'd look a twat in a jumpsuit.


32
0:2:59,56 --> 0:3:2,44
Don't say that.
That's a word that hates women.


33
0:3:2,44 --> 0:3:5,64
- Twat ?
- No, jumpsuit.


34
0:3:5,64 --> 0:3:8,8
Aaaah ! Look. Oh, my God !
What's in the fridge ?


35
0:3:8,8 --> 0:3:15,8
# Wooooooo #


36
0:3:15,8 --> 0:3:21,84
Oh, no !


37
0:3:21,84 --> 0:3:24,2
- Don't you like it ?
- I love it.


38
0:3:24,2 --> 0:3:25,76
- Is that me ?
- Yeah.


39
0:3:25,76 --> 0:3:28,96
Anyway, happy birthday, pickle.


40
0:3:28,96 --> 0:3:32,48
I'm gonna do a wee.


41
0:3:32,48 --> 0:3:33,76
Hi.


42
0:3:33,76 --> 0:3:36,88
Oh, God. Hi, Sophie.
I forgot you were here.


43
0:3:36,88 --> 0:3:39,12
Happy birthday.


44
0:3:39,12 --> 0:3:40,36
Thanks.


45
0:3:40,36 --> 0:3:42,32
So, you got anything
special planned ?


46
0:3:42,32 --> 0:3:44,8
I think we're
going out for dinner,


47
0:3:44,8 --> 0:3:46,4
- you know.
- That'll be nice.


48
0:3:46,4 --> 0:3:48,68
Yeah. I mean you can
come if you want.


49
0:3:48,68 --> 0:3:51,76
Oh, thanks. Yeah, I'd love to.
That'd be great.


50
0:3:51,76 --> 0:3:55,24
Oh. Ahem. Good.


51
0:3:55,24 --> 0:3:57,76
Daisy's invited me
to the meal this evening.


52
0:3:57,76 --> 0:4:0,48
- That'll be cool.
- Yeah.


53
0:4:0,48 --> 0:4:3,12
I'm sure Marsha won't get suspicious.


54
0:4:3,12 --> 0:4:5,24
- I don't want to cause trouble.
- You're not.


55
0:4:5,24 --> 0:4:8,44
- I don't know why we don't tell her.
- What are you gonna say ?


56
0:4:8,44 --> 0:4:10,72
"By the way, we're not
really a couple.


57
0:4:10,72 --> 0:4:14,0
"We lied to you for a year
so we could rent your flat."


58
0:4:14,0 --> 0:4:16,72
- We're evil.
- You did what you had to,


59
0:4:16,72 --> 0:4:21,56
- you shouldn't feel bad.
- We don't.


60
0:4:21,56 --> 0:4:24,72
- Come on, you.
- Where you off to ?


61
0:4:24,72 --> 0:4:26,52
I'm gonna walk Sophie to the Tube.


62
0:4:26,52 --> 0:4:28,8
Ah, that's sweet.


63
0:4:28,8 --> 0:4:30,8
It is, isn't it ?


64
0:4:30,8 --> 0:4:32,4
Yeah.


65
0:4:32,4 --> 0:4:34,4
- Bye.
- Bye.


66
0:4:34,4 --> 0:4:36,72
See you later, Daisy.
Happy birthday.


67
0:4:36,72 --> 0:4:38,84
Bye, Sophie. Bye-bye.


68
0:4:38,84 --> 0:5:6,28
What a bitch.


69
0:5:6,28 --> 0:5:9,48
I've got this really cool surprise
birthday cake for Daisy


70
0:5:9,48 --> 0:5:11,52
in the shape of a typewriter.


71
0:5:11,52 --> 0:5:13,56
- Cool.
- I've been scheming for weeks.


72
0:5:13,56 --> 0:5:17,52
I met this baker at Strawberry
Sundae. We danced for five hours


73
0:5:17,52 --> 0:5:20,2
then had an involved discussion
about pasties.


74
0:5:20,2 --> 0:5:22,2
And anyway, he's doing me a deal.


75
0:5:22,2 --> 0:5:24,72
- You're sweet to Daisy.
- I am, aren't I ?


76
0:5:24,72 --> 0:5:27,0
- Yeah.
- Well, I'm a sweet guy.


77
0:5:27,0 --> 0:5:37,28
- You're a stupid cock.
- Ah, well. Thanks.


78
0:5:37,28 --> 0:5:45,52
Just relax.


79
0:5:45,52 --> 0:5:48,68
- Hi.
- Where were you ?


80
0:5:48,68 --> 0:5:50,44
- When ?
- This morning.


81
0:5:50,44 --> 0:5:51,88
I was in bed.


82
0:5:51,88 --> 0:5:54,84
Why was today important to me, Tim ?


83
0:5:54,84 --> 0:5:56,48
Being promoted to sergeant next week,


84
0:5:56,48 --> 0:5:58,4
- don't forget.
- I won't.


85
0:5:58,4 --> 0:5:59,88
Being promoted to sergeant Saturday,


86
0:5:59,88 --> 0:6:1,24
- don't forget.
- I won't.


87
0:6:1,24 --> 0:6:3,24
What was that ?


88
0:6:3,24 --> 0:6:4,92
I'm being promoted tomorrow,


89
0:6:4,92 --> 0:6:6,8
- don't forget.
- I won't !


90
0:6:6,8 --> 0:6:10,24
Er, yeah. I forgot.


91
0:6:10,24 --> 0:6:11,76
- You forgot.
- Sorry.


92
0:6:11,76 --> 0:6:14,28
- I thought you were my friend.
- I am.


93
0:6:14,28 --> 0:6:17,24
I wanted you to see me
get my stripes.


94
0:6:17,24 --> 0:6:18,76
What can I say ? I'm sorry.


95
0:6:18,76 --> 0:6:20,4
- It's her.
- What ?


96
0:6:20,4 --> 0:6:22,36
Sophie. You've only
been with her two weeks


97
0:6:22,36 --> 0:6:23,72
and I'm yesterday's news.


98
0:6:23,72 --> 0:6:26,4
It wasn't this bad
when you were with Sarah.


99
0:6:26,4 --> 0:6:28,24
Mike, you will always be
my number one.


100
0:6:28,24 --> 0:6:32,12
Why are you treating me
like a number two ?


101
0:6:32,12 --> 0:6:35,16
It's been a long time since
I've had a Sophie in my life.


102
0:6:35,16 --> 0:6:36,48
I'm just excited.


103
0:6:36,48 --> 0:6:40,56
You are my longest-serving friend.
We've done everything together.


104
0:6:40,56 --> 0:6:44,76
0r have you forgotten the good times ?


105
0:6:44,76 --> 0:6:46,32
No, of course not.


106
0:6:46,32 --> 0:6:49,48
We were supposed to go
ghost-hunting last week.


107
0:6:49,48 --> 0:6:53,36
- I know.
- Where were you ?


108
0:6:53,36 --> 0:6:55,32
I can't remember.


109
0:6:55,32 --> 0:6:58,36
Well, I'm glad you're happy
with your new girlfriend.


110
0:6:58,36 --> 0:7:0,64
Don't forget whose shoulder
you cried on


111
0:7:0,64 --> 0:7:2,52
- when you got dumped.
- I won't.


112
0:7:2,52 --> 0:7:5,8
0r when Johnny Alpha got killed
by that monster in 2000AD.


113
0:7:5,8 --> 0:7:7,0
Mike, I won't.


114
0:7:7,0 --> 0:7:8,72
Here's Mike.


115
0:7:8,72 --> 0:7:11,6
- Mike, do your eagle eyes.
- Don't !


116
0:7:11,6 --> 0:7:18,84
You hurt him, I'll kill you.


117
0:7:18,84 --> 0:7:24,72
Did he mean that ?


118
0:7:24,72 --> 0:7:33,64
Yeah.


119
0:7:33,64 --> 0:7:35,72
Knock, knock, knock.


120
0:7:35,72 --> 0:7:38,16
Hello, birthday girl.


121
0:7:38,16 --> 0:7:40,76
Hello, Marsha. How's it going ?


122
0:7:40,76 --> 0:7:43,16
I'm fine, how are you ?


123
0:7:43,16 --> 0:7:46,72
Oh, I'm fine. 26.


124
0:7:46,72 --> 0:7:52,24
Happy birthday, darling.


125
0:7:52,24 --> 0:7:53,72
Are you missing Amber ?


126
0:7:53,72 --> 0:7:58,36
Oh, yeah. Yeah.


127
0:7:58,36 --> 0:8:0,6
Many 'appy returns, darling.


128
0:8:0,6 --> 0:8:2,48
Oh, what can it be ?


129
0:8:2,48 --> 0:8:5,16
I thought you might
put some make-up on tonight.


130
0:8:5,16 --> 0:8:7,32
Doll yourself up a bit.


131
0:8:7,32 --> 0:8:9,52
I don't wear much
normally, but...


132
0:8:9,52 --> 0:8:12,12
Oooh ! Rude Red.


133
0:8:12,12 --> 0:8:15,68
Right, well I best go off to
Threshers, do the weekly shop.


134
0:8:15,68 --> 0:8:19,44
You still up for a night
of unadulterated fun ?


135
0:8:19,44 --> 0:8:20,76
Adultery ?


136
0:8:20,76 --> 0:8:23,0
Are you still coming out tonight ?


137
0:8:23,0 --> 0:8:31,8
Oh, yeah. Right. I'll see you later.


138
0:8:31,8 --> 0:8:32,28
Hello.


139
0:8:32,28 --> 0:8:33,8
Hi, Daisy. It's me.


140
0:8:33,8 --> 0:8:35,52
Hello, Twist.


141
0:8:35,52 --> 0:8:38,96
It's nice to speak to you.
I feel I haven't seen you in ages.


142
0:8:38,96 --> 0:8:41,8
You were at my birthday
thing last night.


143
0:8:41,8 --> 0:8:43,0
Oh, yes. That was you, wasn't it ?


144
0:8:43,0 --> 0:8:45,4
'Look, do you wanna come shopping ? '


145
0:8:45,4 --> 0:8:47,64
Um, I'd love to
but I haven't got any money.


146
0:8:47,64 --> 0:8:50,12
Oh, I don't need any.
Will you meet me ?


147
0:8:50,12 --> 0:8:52,28
- Where are you ?
- 0n your street.


148
0:8:52,28 --> 0:8:54,8
- All right, Twist.
- Hi, Tim.


149
0:8:54,8 --> 0:8:56,36
What are you doing on my street ?


150
0:8:56,36 --> 0:9:0,8
I can't explain.
Just come and meet me.


151
0:9:0,8 --> 0:9:5,48
All right, well.
Just give me a mo'.


152
0:9:5,48 --> 0:9:9,16
Oi !


153
0:9:9,16 --> 0:9:12,0
Hi, Marsha.


154
0:9:12,0 --> 0:9:15,44
I know what you're up to.


155
0:9:15,44 --> 0:9:18,4
Did Mike tell you ?


156
0:9:18,4 --> 0:9:21,36
Does he know ?


157
0:9:21,36 --> 0:9:25,64
I had to tell somebody.


158
0:9:25,64 --> 0:9:29,28
You are a very bad man.


159
0:9:29,28 --> 0:9:31,24
What ?


160
0:9:31,24 --> 0:9:32,84
She loves you, that girl.


161
0:9:32,84 --> 0:9:34,4
- Who does ?
- Daisy.


162
0:9:34,4 --> 0:9:36,48
- Does she ?
- Course she does.


163
0:9:36,48 --> 0:9:39,28
- Did she say that ?
- No ! But it's obvious, innit ?


164
0:9:39,28 --> 0:9:42,2
Yeah. Course.
She's my girlfriend.


165
0:9:42,2 --> 0:9:44,48
Yeah, well you better tell her, Tim.


166
0:9:44,48 --> 0:9:47,56
Cos if you don't, I will.


167
0:9:47,56 --> 0:9:53,0
But you'll spoil the surprise.


168
0:9:53,0 --> 0:9:58,16
You bastard.


169
0:9:58,16 --> 0:10:2,16
- Marsha !


170
0:10:2,16 --> 0:10:6,68
Brian ?


171
0:10:6,68 --> 0:10:13,36
Brian ?


172
0:10:13,36 --> 0:10:15,76
Brian ?


173
0:10:15,76 --> 0:10:20,4
- I've finished with Brian.
- Oh. Oh.


174
0:10:20,4 --> 0:10:21,84
Oh, my God.


175
0:10:21,84 --> 0:10:23,32
Are you all right ?


176
0:10:23,32 --> 0:10:24,68
What about ?


177
0:10:24,68 --> 0:10:29,64
About... How's Brian taking it ?


178
0:10:29,64 --> 0:10:31,32
Brian, no !


179
0:10:31,32 --> 0:10:35,44
Oh, God !


180
0:10:35,44 --> 0:10:38,56
Why ? This is new !


181
0:10:38,56 --> 0:10:39,92
Sorry, I didn't see you.


182
0:10:39,92 --> 0:10:43,12
- What are you doing ?
- Expressing myself.


183
0:10:43,12 --> 0:10:45,92
- By chucking paint around ?
- Yes.


184
0:10:45,92 --> 0:10:47,68
What's the matter with you ?


185
0:10:47,68 --> 0:10:50,4
Broken up with Twist.


186
0:10:50,4 --> 0:10:52,92
Oh, shit. Really ?


187
0:10:52,92 --> 0:10:54,36
What happened ?


188
0:10:54,36 --> 0:10:56,8
Sex, sex, sex.
That's all it ever was.


189
0:10:56,8 --> 0:10:59,48
- I wanted something else.
- So, you're single.


190
0:10:59,48 --> 0:11:1,76
I'm tired of our endless clashing.


191
0:11:1,76 --> 0:11:3,4
- What, your outfits ?
- Daisy !


192
0:11:3,4 --> 0:11:9,48
I am not that shallow.


193
0:11:9,48 --> 0:11:12,92
She's shallow, Brian. She's like...


194
0:11:12,92 --> 0:11:15,16
Cordelia out of
Buffy the Vampire Slayer,


195
0:11:15,16 --> 0:11:17,88
and latterly Angel,
the spin-off series set in LA.


196
0:11:17,88 --> 0:11:20,0
I don't know what
you're talking about.


197
0:11:20,0 --> 0:11:22,24
Brian !


198
0:11:22,24 --> 0:11:24,8
You're such a square.


199
0:11:24,8 --> 0:11:28,8
- Think she'll come tonight ?
- She is Daisy's best friend.


200
0:11:28,8 --> 0:11:30,36
You've just got to be strong, man.


201
0:11:30,36 --> 0:11:32,88
- I know.
- You're gonna be fine.


202
0:11:32,88 --> 0:11:35,2
After a long time
thinking you won't be,


203
0:11:35,2 --> 0:11:37,76
one morning you'll wake up
and you will be.


204
0:11:37,76 --> 0:11:41,4
You'll miss the fact you're not
cos it's scarier when you are.


205
0:11:41,4 --> 0:11:45,4
When you're not, you've got
something to cling to.


206
0:11:45,4 --> 0:11:48,56
Then you're gonna be fine,
all right ?


207
0:11:48,56 --> 0:11:52,6
Feeling better ?


208
0:11:52,6 --> 0:11:54,44
Does that feel better ?


209
0:11:54,44 --> 0:11:57,16
Hmm. Is Brian coming tonight ?


210
0:11:57,16 --> 0:12:0,64
Yes. But he is my friend, Twist.


211
0:12:0,64 --> 0:12:2,48
I suppose so.


212
0:12:2,48 --> 0:12:4,88
Well, at least we'll
see more of each other.


213
0:12:4,88 --> 0:12:7,8
Yeah, I hadn't really
thought of that.


214
0:12:7,8 --> 0:12:10,16
Hey, why don't you
try something on ?


215
0:12:10,16 --> 0:12:14,6
You always wear that shantytown look
and it's really quite last-century.


216
0:12:14,6 --> 0:12:16,56
I quite like the way I dress.


217
0:12:16,56 --> 0:12:20,4
Shh. Listen.


218
0:12:20,4 --> 0:12:24,4
There's nothing wrong
with looking nice, Daisy.


219
0:12:24,4 --> 0:12:26,16
You're not betraying
the sisterhood


220
0:12:26,16 --> 0:12:29,28
just by brushing your hair
once in a while, hmm ?


221
0:12:29,28 --> 0:12:32,96
I just doubt there's anything in
here I could get above my knees.


222
0:12:32,96 --> 0:12:40,52
Go on, it's your birthday.


223
0:12:40,52 --> 0:12:43,48
'Did I update you
on the Susie situation ?


224
0:12:43,48 --> 0:12:46,2
'Well, far be it from me
to spread gossip,


225
0:12:46,2 --> 0:12:48,92
'but apparently her GP
is having an affair


226
0:12:48,92 --> 0:12:51,8
'with that woman at the dentist.


227
0:12:51,8 --> 0:12:53,56
- 'Anyway, apparently... '
- Mum, hi.


228
0:12:53,56 --> 0:12:56,52
'Hello, love.
I didn't think you were in.'


229
0:12:56,52 --> 0:12:59,84
- No, I've been out.
- 'Since 9 this morning ? '


230
0:12:59,84 --> 0:13:4,32
Er, yeah. Yeah.
You know me - go, go, go.


231
0:13:4,32 --> 0:13:8,8
'Well, I've got a lot to tell
you and you never phone me.


232
0:13:8,8 --> 0:13:10,8
- 'Happy birthday, dumpling.'
- Thanks.


233
0:13:10,8 --> 0:13:13,36
- 'I've got some great news.'
- What ?


234
0:13:13,36 --> 0:13:15,16
'Your Auntie Caroline called.


235
0:13:15,16 --> 0:13:18,84
'She said a vacancy has come up
for a features correspondent.


236
0:13:18,84 --> 0:13:21,4
'She's going to send you
all the bumph about it.


237
0:13:21,4 --> 0:13:23,0
'That's nice, isn't it ?


238
0:13:23,0 --> 0:13:25,8
'And the best thing,
it's the Colwyn Bay Gazette !


239
0:13:25,8 --> 0:13:28,8
'That'd be right
up your street, wouldn't it ? '


240
0:13:28,8 --> 0:13:31,6
Yeah. Yeah.


241
0:13:31,6 --> 0:13:34,2
'Are you and Tim
doing anything nice today ? '


242
0:13:34,2 --> 0:13:36,32
Um, we're just going out for a meal.


243
0:13:36,32 --> 0:13:38,36
'Just the two of you ? '


244
0:13:38,36 --> 0:13:41,8
No, no. Us and a few... friends.


245
0:13:41,8 --> 0:13:45,84
'Well, you must be
looking forward to it.'


246
0:13:45,84 --> 0:13:47,16
Yeah.


247
0:13:47,16 --> 0:13:52,48
# He used to give me roses


248
0:13:52,48 --> 0:13:58,0
# I wish he could again


249
0:13:58,0 --> 0:14:3,64
# But that was on the outside


250
0:14:3,64 --> 0:14:6,36
# And things were different then


251
0:14:6,36 --> 0:14:11,88
# 0n the inside the sun still shines


252
0:14:11,88 --> 0:14:17,48
# And the rain falls down


253
0:14:17,48 --> 0:14:23,0
# And the sun and rain
are prisoners, too


254
0:14:23,0 --> 0:14:36,96
# When morning comes around #


255
0:14:36,96 --> 0:14:38,88
Hit me.

with looking nice.'

put some make-up on tonight.

Oh, God.


264
0:15:11,0 --> 0:15:22,16
Oh, shit.


265
0:15:22,16 --> 0:15:39,16
Right.


266
0:15:39,16 --> 0:15:42,64
Hi. Sorry, we're... I'm late.
It was, you know.


267
0:15:42,64 --> 0:15:44,12
Delayed at the office ?


268
0:15:44,12 --> 0:15:45,84
I had to pop in, yeah.


269
0:15:45,84 --> 0:15:49,24
I bet you did.


270
0:15:49,24 --> 0:15:52,36
- Right. Shall I get some drinks ?
- A treble vodka, please.


271
0:15:52,36 --> 0:15:54,96
- Brian ?
- Um...


272
0:15:54,96 --> 0:15:57,16
- Bottle of red.
- How many glasses ?


273
0:15:57,16 --> 0:15:59,68
- One.
- Ok. Bitter, Mike ?


274
0:15:59,68 --> 0:16:1,32
No, are you ?


275
0:16:1,32 --> 0:16:4,92
- Would you like a pint of bitter ?
- Oh. Yeah.


276
0:16:4,92 --> 0:16:6,72
Soph... ie ?


277
0:16:6,72 --> 0:16:13,0
Bourbon, Tim. Straight up.


278
0:16:13,0 --> 0:16:16,4
# I may not be a lady #


279
0:16:16,4 --> 0:16:17,76
Wow !


280
0:16:17,76 --> 0:16:20,16
# But I'm all woman


281
0:16:20,16 --> 0:16:21,88
# From Monday to Sunday


282
0:16:21,88 --> 0:16:26,32
# I work harder than you know


283
0:16:26,32 --> 0:16:28,8
# I'm no... #


284
0:16:28,8 --> 0:16:33,4
Woo.


285
0:16:33,4 --> 0:16:35,76
Phew. Hi, Daisy,
how you going ? Drink ?


286
0:16:35,76 --> 0:16:39,12
Yes, please.
I'll have a Bloody Mary. Thanks.


287
0:16:39,12 --> 0:16:41,16
- You look nice, Daisy.
- Thanks.


288
0:16:41,16 --> 0:16:43,28
I wish I could dress down like that.


289
0:16:43,28 --> 0:16:45,8
- He's gonna come over.
- Ok.


290
0:16:45,8 --> 0:16:48,36
- Hello. You all right ?
- Yes.


291
0:16:48,36 --> 0:16:50,52
Right, shall we ?


292
0:16:50,52 --> 0:17:19,56
Yes. Merci.


293
0:17:19,56 --> 0:17:21,32
- Are you going to...
- Yes.


294
0:17:21,32 --> 0:17:26,32
We're just going to the loo.


295
0:17:26,32 --> 0:17:28,52
I can't believe you brought her here.


296
0:17:28,52 --> 0:17:30,8
I thought it was quite nice.


297
0:17:30,8 --> 0:17:32,4
So are you gonna tell her ?


298
0:17:32,4 --> 0:17:33,84
Marsha, what is your problem ?


299
0:17:33,84 --> 0:17:35,16
I'll tell her, then.


300
0:17:35,16 --> 0:17:37,56
Why do you want
to spoil her birthday ?


301
0:17:37,56 --> 0:17:41,12
Every second you leave it,
it'll make it more painful for her.


302
0:17:41,12 --> 0:17:43,52
- What ?
- I'm telling her.


303
0:17:43,52 --> 0:17:44,8
- Don't !
- I will.


304
0:17:44,8 --> 0:17:46,32
If anyone tells her, I will.


305
0:17:46,32 --> 0:17:47,64
- You won't.
- No !


306
0:17:47,64 --> 0:17:53,8
What's up ?


307
0:17:53,8 --> 0:17:56,52
- Tim's having an affair.
- I got you a birthday cake.


308
0:17:56,52 --> 0:17:58,0
What ?


309
0:17:58,0 --> 0:18:1,28
Tim is having an affair with her.


310
0:18:1,28 --> 0:18:3,64
- What ?
- I seen 'em snogging


311
0:18:3,64 --> 0:18:5,32
in the front garden.


312
0:18:5,32 --> 0:18:10,28
- No. Marsha, it's not like that.
- What d'you mean ?


313
0:18:10,28 --> 0:18:15,56
No, it is like that and I'm sorry,
Daisy, but she means nothing to me.


314
0:18:15,56 --> 0:18:18,24
- It's not...
- I think we should tell her.


315
0:18:18,24 --> 0:18:20,28
- Tell me what ?
- She's in shock.


316
0:18:20,28 --> 0:18:21,92
- I'm not.
- You are.


317
0:18:21,92 --> 0:18:23,48
- I'm drunk...
- Daisy.


318
0:18:23,48 --> 0:18:25,12
...but I'm lucid.
- Please.


319
0:18:25,12 --> 0:18:26,92
- It's OK.
- What's going on ?


320
0:18:26,92 --> 0:18:28,8
I should go.


321
0:18:28,8 --> 0:18:29,12
Sophie.


322
0:18:29,12 --> 0:18:31,8
Marsha...


323
0:18:31,8 --> 0:18:32,52
we're not really...


324
0:18:32,52 --> 0:18:47,24
a couple.


325
0:18:47,24 --> 0:18:48,44
You what ?


326
0:18:48,44 --> 0:18:52,28
We're not...
We're not really a couple.


327
0:18:52,28 --> 0:19:1,36
Phew. It's actually
a relief to say it !


328
0:19:1,36 --> 0:19:4,8
The thing is, we had to say we were,


329
0:19:4,8 --> 0:19:6,32
in order to get the flat,


330
0:19:6,32 --> 0:19:10,36
but the truth is, that we lied.


331
0:19:10,36 --> 0:19:11,72
You lied ?


332
0:19:11,72 --> 0:19:16,44
Yeah, but we were desperate. We
didn't think about the consequences.


333
0:19:16,44 --> 0:19:19,6
We didn't mean to hurt you.


334
0:19:19,6 --> 0:19:22,36
We just... It was like,
the longer we left it...


335
0:19:22,36 --> 0:19:23,48
You lied ?


336
0:19:23,48 --> 0:19:25,4
- Marsha...
- Why ?


337
0:19:25,4 --> 0:19:27,84
The advert said
"professional couple only".


338
0:19:27,84 --> 0:19:29,32
- No, it didn't.
- It did.


339
0:19:29,32 --> 0:19:31,4
I remember. The bloke was a prick.


340
0:19:31,4 --> 0:19:34,44
I don't think
he was listening to me.


341
0:19:34,44 --> 0:19:38,52
Yeah. Yeah.


342
0:19:38,52 --> 0:19:40,6
- Dave.
- Can you hold on, please ?


343
0:19:40,6 --> 0:19:41,76
Hello, you.


344
0:19:41,76 --> 0:19:44,96
Two-bedroomed, fully furnished,
Streatham, Ј350 a week.


345
0:19:44,96 --> 0:19:46,96
Could you do that ?
I'm going to lunch.


346
0:19:46,96 --> 0:19:49,12
You bet you.


347
0:19:49,12 --> 0:19:52,0
Oh, it's professional couple only.


348
0:19:52,0 --> 0:19:53,48
Sounds nice.


349
0:19:53,48 --> 0:19:55,68
'Professional couple only.


350
0:19:55,68 --> 0:19:59,72
'Professional couple only.'


351
0:19:59,72 --> 0:20:2,36
Sorry about that, Mrs Klein.
Is that everything ?


352
0:20:2,36 --> 0:20:5,4
Great. That'll go in tomorrow.


353
0:20:5,4 --> 0:20:7,88
I can't believe
you lied all this time.


354
0:20:7,88 --> 0:20:10,96
I bought you a present
for your anniversary ! Both of 'em.


355
0:20:10,96 --> 0:20:13,12
I'm sorry.


356
0:20:13,12 --> 0:20:14,44
- Oh !
- Look, Marsha.


357
0:20:14,44 --> 0:20:17,8
Please. Just understand.


358
0:20:17,8 --> 0:20:19,4
We weren't being malicious.
We didn't have a choice.


359
0:20:19,4 --> 0:20:25,68
We really like that flat.
That was supposed to sound nice.


360
0:20:25,68 --> 0:20:29,8
I suppose you lot
all knew about this.


361
0:20:29,8 --> 0:20:31,48
You must think
I'm a complete idiot.


362
0:20:31,48 --> 0:20:35,2
No !


363
0:20:35,2 --> 0:20:36,48
Don't be angry.


364
0:20:36,48 --> 0:20:38,96
How d'you want me to be, Daisy ?


365
0:20:38,96 --> 0:20:41,76
I just found out
my new little group of young friends


366
0:20:41,76 --> 0:20:43,8
has been taking the piss.


367
0:20:43,8 --> 0:20:45,2
- Marsha.
- No, Brian. I'm leaving.


368
0:20:45,2 --> 0:20:58,52
- Where are you going ?
- Just away from you lot.


369
0:20:58,52 --> 0:21:0,12
I really think I should go.


370
0:21:0,12 --> 0:21:2,2
- Sophie.
- No, look, Tim.


371
0:21:2,2 --> 0:21:3,48
I'll call you tomorrow.


372
0:21:3,48 --> 0:21:8,48
Bye.


373
0:21:8,48 --> 0:21:9,68
Nice one, Daisy.


374
0:21:9,68 --> 0:21:12,6
I wasn't the one snogging


375
0:21:12,6 --> 0:21:15,56
my supposedly secret girlfriend
in the front garden.


376
0:21:15,56 --> 0:21:17,48
Tim doesn't
think about anyone else


377
0:21:17,48 --> 0:21:20,12
- when he's with Sophie.
- Stay out of this.


378
0:21:20,12 --> 0:21:21,92
It's got nothing to do with you.


379
0:21:21,92 --> 0:21:24,96
It's got everything to do
with me. I live in that house.


380
0:21:24,96 --> 0:21:27,52
I'll have to live with my mum
because of you.


381
0:21:27,52 --> 0:21:30,28
Because of me ?
I'm not the one who told her !


382
0:21:30,28 --> 0:21:32,92
You could have kept
your tongue in your mouth !


383
0:21:32,92 --> 0:21:35,56
I think we're all
to blame in a way.


384
0:21:35,56 --> 0:21:37,56
Oh, thank you very much,
Mrs Magnanimous.


385
0:21:37,56 --> 0:21:39,56
Fine time to grow
a fucking conscience !


386
0:21:39,56 --> 0:21:41,88
Are you letting him
speak to me like that ?


387
0:21:41,88 --> 0:21:43,32
- Yes !
- What ?


388
0:21:43,32 --> 0:21:46,72
I'm not an accessory
to pick up when you need me.


389
0:21:46,72 --> 0:21:48,52
Good time to start getting
emotionally articulate.


390
0:21:48,52 --> 0:21:51,8
- Don't lay into Brian !
- I'm not !


391
0:21:51,8 --> 0:21:53,44
I can't believe you
after all we've...


392
0:21:53,44 --> 0:21:55,2
- It's your fault.
- Shut up !


393
0:21:55,2 --> 0:21:58,4
- Did you see her face ?
- Say something !


394
0:21:58,4 --> 0:22:1,8
- Shut up !
- Why did you bring her ?


395
0:22:1,8 --> 0:22:4,6
You are so stupid, Daisy !


396
0:22:4,6 --> 0:22:6,88
# Happy birthday, dear Daisy


397
0:22:6,88 --> 0:22:33,84
# Happy birthday to you #


398
0:22:33,84 --> 0:22:36,0
Tim ! You know
I'm allergic to wheat.


399
0:22:36,0 --> 0:22:41,24
Oh, fuck off.


400
0:22:41,24 --> 0:23:9,36
- Grow up.
- You grow up.


401
0:23:9,36 --> 0:23:13,52
Well, the way I see it,
we have two choices.


402
0:23:13,52 --> 0:23:15,52
We can call the police,


403
0:23:15,52 --> 0:23:19,72
or you can clear up
this mess yourselves.


404
0:23:19,72 --> 0:23:24,36
Who votes for clearing up ?


405
0:23:24,36 --> 0:23:29,8
Who votes for police ?


406
0:23:29,8 --> 0:23:31,0
Clearing up it is, yeah.


407
0:23:31,0 --> 0:23:42,4
Good. I'll get the mop, shall I ?


408
0:23:42,4 --> 0:23:44,52
I'm going home.


409
0:23:44,52 --> 0:23:52,64
Happy birthday, Daisy.


410
0:23:52,64 --> 0:23:55,28
- What are we gonna do ?
- We could go clubbing.


411
0:23:55,28 --> 0:23:57,76
I mean about Marsha.


412
0:23:57,76 --> 0:24:2,24
We've destroyed her faith in
the integrity of today's youth.


413
0:24:2,24 --> 0:24:4,96
Young adults.


414
0:24:4,96 --> 0:24:9,28
We've gotta pull together
or else we're gonna lose everything.


415
0:24:9,28 --> 0:24:23,56
- So that's settled.
- Clubbing it is !


416
0:24:23,56 --> 0:24:26,6
Brian and Mike
have gone to look for her.


417
0:24:26,6 --> 0:24:29,56
There's a hundred
off-licences in this area.


418
0:24:29,56 --> 0:24:31,48
She could be in any one of them.


419
0:24:31,48 --> 0:24:33,4
Yeah, well. They might get lucky.


420
0:24:33,4 --> 0:24:35,84
We should stay here
in case she comes back.


421
0:24:35,84 --> 0:24:39,4
- OK.
- Look, Daisy. Don't worry.


422
0:24:39,4 --> 0:24:41,52
We'll sort this out. We always do.


423
0:24:41,52 --> 0:24:44,68
I don't know.
This feels different.


424
0:24:44,68 --> 0:24:50,36
Serious. We've had some good
times here though, haven't we ?


425
0:24:50,36 --> 0:24:53,2
Yeah.


426
0:24:53,2 --> 0:24:56,2
- Happy days.
- Yeah.


427
0:24:56,2 --> 0:24:58,56
'We'll be off then, Tim.'


428
0:24:58,56 --> 0:24:59,88
OK.


429
0:24:59,88 --> 0:25:3,12
If we find Marsha, we'll contact you.


430
0:25:3,12 --> 0:25:6,48
Um, yeah.
We'll find her, Daisy.


431
0:25:6,48 --> 0:25:8,4
Promise you.


432
0:25:8,4 --> 0:25:11,72
We'll see you at the rendez-vous.


433
0:25:11,72 --> 0:25:16,48
Ok, Tim.


434
0:25:16,48 --> 0:27:16,48
Good luck.
