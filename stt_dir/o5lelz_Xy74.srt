0:0:56,48 --> 0:0:59,766
ARTO SAARI: Mama's Tacos and
Quesadillas is going to have a


3
0:0:59,766 --> 0:1:2,256
competitor pretty soon.


4
0:1:2,256 --> 0:1:3,884
After a couple more of these.


5
0:1:3,884 --> 0:1:26,114



6
0:1:26,114 --> 0:1:27,102
MALE SPEAKER: There.


7
0:1:27,102 --> 0:1:28,922
The thing that's not supposed
to be there but is there?


8
0:1:28,922 --> 0:1:30,172
MALE SPEAKER: Yep.


9
0:1:30,172 --> 0:1:43,416



10
0:1:43,416 --> 0:1:44,666
MALE SPEAKER: I feel
like I got hung up.


11
0:1:44,666 --> 0:1:47,71



12
0:1:47,71 --> 0:1:49,7
MALE SPEAKER: That's what I do
when I get fucking wasted.


13
0:1:49,7 --> 0:1:52,985
It's how I get home.


14
0:1:52,985 --> 0:1:54,925
ARTO SAARI: Are you guys
going to town?


15
0:1:54,925 --> 0:1:57,931
BILL BRYANT: Yeah,
such as it is.


16
0:1:57,931 --> 0:1:58,793
Want in?


17
0:1:58,793 --> 0:2:0,963
ARTO SAARI: Yeah, you
got room there?


18
0:2:0,963 --> 0:2:2,451
BILL BRYANT: You're going to
have either squeeze or hop in


19
0:2:2,451 --> 0:2:3,493
the far back.


20
0:2:3,493 --> 0:2:6,627
ARTO SAARI: I don't see a
DVD player back here.


21
0:2:6,627 --> 0:2:14,82
MALE SPEAKER: We got bub, we
got pillows, we got smokes.


22
0:2:14,82 --> 0:2:15,332
Whoa!


23
0:2:15,332 --> 0:2:20,46



24
0:2:20,46 --> 0:2:24,22
MALE SPEAKER: Baja Ride, 2009.


25
0:2:24,22 --> 0:2:25,16
HIME HERBERT: Oh!


26
0:2:25,16 --> 0:2:26,1
ARTO SAARI: OK.


27
0:2:26,1 --> 0:2:27,501
HIME HERBERT: Oh, God.


28
0:2:27,501 --> 0:2:31,52
ARTO SAARI: OK, OK, OK.


29
0:2:31,52 --> 0:2:35,855
I'm walking, I'm walking.


30
0:2:35,855 --> 0:2:37,352
Oh, fuck.


31
0:2:37,352 --> 0:2:38,602
Fuck that.


32
0:2:38,602 --> 0:2:52,33

0:2:52,33 --> 0:2:54,5
[SPEAKING SPANISH]


34
0:2:54,5 --> 0:2:59,72
ARTO SAARI: Oh, look at
the barbecue machine.


35
0:2:59,72 --> 0:3:0,89
Broil-Mate, dude.


36
0:3:0,89 --> 0:3:2,33
MALE SPEAKER: Where's
Harvey at?


37
0:3:2,33 --> 0:3:4,31
Here's the dentist.

[SPEAKING SPANISH]


39
0:3:7,775 --> 0:3:24,11



40
0:3:24,11 --> 0:3:26,46
ARTO SAARI: I think that's going
to become the currency


41
0:3:26,46 --> 0:3:27,82
for the next four days.


42
0:3:27,82 --> 0:3:28,55
HEATH KIRCHART: Food?


43
0:3:28,55 --> 0:3:30,88
ARTO SAARI: Food and cigarettes
is going to be the


44
0:3:30,88 --> 0:3:31,805
most valid currency.


45
0:3:31,805 --> 0:3:33,764
HEATH KIRCHART: So buy
cigarettes, even though I


46
0:3:33,764 --> 0:3:34,73
don't smoke?


47
0:3:34,73 --> 0:3:35,476
ARTO SAARI: Yeah.


48
0:3:35,476 --> 0:3:37,38
BILL BRYANT: Sounds
like prison.


49
0:3:37,38 --> 0:3:38,332
ARTO SAARI: Huh?


50
0:3:38,332 --> 0:3:40,236
BILL BRYANT: That sounds
like prison.


51
0:3:40,236 --> 0:3:41,86
ARTO SAARI: They're not
vegetarian, are they?


52
0:3:41,86 --> 0:3:47,44
HEATH KIRCHART: He eats fish,
but Patrick's a vegetarian.


53
0:3:47,44 --> 0:3:50,458
Harvey's whatever.


54
0:3:50,458 --> 0:3:52,368
ARTO SAARI: How'd he
lose his tooth?


55
0:3:52,368 --> 0:3:53,802
HEATH KIRCHART: Got punched.


56
0:3:53,802 --> 0:3:54,758
ARTO SAARI: Really?


57
0:3:54,758 --> 0:3:55,236
HEATH KIRCHART: Yeah.


58
0:3:55,236 --> 0:3:58,501
ARTO SAARI: Wow, that's
pretty gnarly.


59
0:3:58,501 --> 0:4:1,62
HEATH KIRCHART: They met up
on one of the wild rides.


60
0:4:1,62 --> 0:4:2,95
They just traveled
across country,


61
0:4:2,95 --> 0:4:4,982
met us in South Carolina.


62
0:4:4,982 --> 0:4:8,29
Kept their distance for a couple
days and then slowly


63
0:4:8,29 --> 0:4:10,17
came into the fold.


64
0:4:10,17 --> 0:4:12,69
Now they want everything.


65
0:4:12,69 --> 0:4:14,325
We don't even do the wild
ride anymore and


66
0:4:14,325 --> 0:4:15,575
they still come out.


67
0:4:15,575 --> 0:4:20,638



68
0:4:20,638 --> 0:4:25,2
KYNAN TAIT: I think it seems
like we come as a package.


69
0:4:25,2 --> 0:4:27,83
Because we're both Canadians,
we're both friends, we both


70
0:4:27,83 --> 0:4:28,58
have Harleys.


71
0:4:28,58 --> 0:4:31,35
PATRICK O'DELL: Not to say that
pro skaters are going to


72
0:4:31,35 --> 0:4:33,9
be wimpy or something,
because they're not.


73
0:4:33,9 --> 0:4:36,94
But it's good to have people
that don't even have that kind


74
0:4:36,94 --> 0:4:37,762
of agenda or anything.


75
0:4:37,762 --> 0:4:43,23
They just want to motorcycle
and skate and hang out.


76
0:4:43,23 --> 0:4:46,53
And Harvey, he works on
oil rigs and stuff.


77
0:4:46,53 --> 0:4:51,27
He works all winter on a oil
rig, saving enough money to


78
0:4:51,27 --> 0:4:53,49
get to come on these trips.


79
0:4:53,49 --> 0:4:55,17
It's easy to kind of take
this stuff for granted.


80
0:4:55,17 --> 0:4:57,58
But for Harvey, this is the
highlight of his year.


81
0:4:57,58 --> 0:5:0,646



82
0:5:0,646 --> 0:5:3,83
HARVEY FOSTER: These trips
aren't expensive to do.


83
0:5:3,83 --> 0:5:8,12
It's like all right, I can work
for like three or four


84
0:5:8,12 --> 0:5:10,32
weeks, if that, and I
have enough money


85
0:5:10,32 --> 0:5:11,48
to go on this trip.


86
0:5:11,48 --> 0:5:14,47
I like to do whatever I
want whenever I want.


87
0:5:14,47 --> 0:5:18,53
I guess going where the
road takes you.


88
0:5:18,53 --> 0:5:22,255
That's so cliche though.


89
0:5:22,255 --> 0:5:24,94
HIME HERBERT: It's going to be
nice to get back on some


90
0:5:24,94 --> 0:5:26,79
smooth pavement, actually.


91
0:5:26,79 --> 0:5:30,302
Just trying to get back
on the open highway.


92
0:5:30,302 --> 0:5:35,33
BILL BRYANT: We are here,
basically, Camelon.


93
0:5:35,33 --> 0:5:37,53
Arizarios where we were planning
on trying to get some


94
0:5:37,53 --> 0:5:37,99
lunch or dinner.


95
0:5:37,99 --> 0:5:40,2
That's where Mama
Espinoza's is.


96
0:5:40,2 --> 0:5:43,49
And then where we're trying to
stop is Catavina, which is


97
0:5:43,49 --> 0:5:45,36
kind of the dead spot.


98
0:5:45,36 --> 0:5:48,57
Middle of this no-man's land
as we switch over from the


99
0:5:48,57 --> 0:5:51,37
Pacific side to the Sea
of Cortez side.


100
0:5:51,37 --> 0:5:54,265
There's not much out there,
and if we end up riding El


101
0:5:54,265 --> 0:5:57,79
Rosario to Catavina in the
dark, it's going to suck.


102
0:5:57,79 --> 0:5:59,39
I mean, it's just a recipe
for disaster.


103
0:5:59,39 --> 0:6:8,296



104
0:6:8,296 --> 0:6:9,77
KYNAN TAIT: I knew he
was going to come.


105
0:6:9,77 --> 0:6:15,68
I just half expected him to be
there at dawn waiting for us


106
0:6:15,68 --> 0:6:16,93
when we got there.


107
0:6:16,93 --> 0:6:20,149



108
0:6:20,149 --> 0:6:25,135
ARTO SAARI: Where the fuck
is the Canadian?


109
0:6:25,135 --> 0:6:27,343
MALE SPEAKER: You didn't hear
from Keegan at all?


110
0:6:27,343 --> 0:6:27,826
MALE SPEAKER: No.


111
0:6:27,826 --> 0:6:29,67
HARVEY FOSTER: That's the
question of the day.


112
0:6:29,67 --> 0:6:32,415
MALE SPEAKER: I mean, we knew
that he'd be here between


113
0:6:32,415 --> 0:6:32,75
12:30 and 1:00.


114
0:6:32,75 --> 0:6:33,91
HARVEY FOSTER: I think
that's him.


115
0:6:33,91 --> 0:6:36,57
MALE SPEAKER: That's been
said for a while.


116
0:6:36,57 --> 0:6:38,16
ARTO SAARI: That's probably
going to be the name of the


117
0:6:38,16 --> 0:6:41,98
trip, have you heard
of Keegan yet?


118
0:6:41,98 --> 0:6:45,484
HEATH KIRCHART: Canadian God.


119
0:6:45,484 --> 0:6:48,236
HARVEY FOSTER: The
Canadian God.


120
0:6:48,236 --> 0:6:49,58
PATRICK O'DELL: Can you
explain Keegan Sauder?


121
0:6:49,58 --> 0:6:51,91
What he means to a Canadian?


122
0:6:51,91 --> 0:6:54,36
HARVEY FOSTER: Should I give
them what I actually think, or


123
0:6:54,36 --> 0:6:55,44
should I hold back?


124
0:6:55,44 --> 0:6:56,3
KYNAN TAIT: [INAUDIBLE].


125
0:6:56,3 --> 0:6:57,59
Can't hold back.


126
0:6:57,59 --> 0:6:59,8
HARVEY FOSTER: I think he's the
fucking raddest Canadian


127
0:6:59,8 --> 0:7:0,65
skateboarder ever.


128
0:7:0,65 --> 0:7:3,775
And I had to listen to like the
guys who didn't know him.


129
0:7:3,775 --> 0:7:8,53
Like, oh fuck, this guy's just
going to show up and make us


130
0:7:8,53 --> 0:7:10,46
wait around like
well, whatever.


131
0:7:10,46 --> 0:7:13,619
And sure enough, he comes
blasting through the desert.


132
0:7:13,619 --> 0:7:16,613
I'm like, come on, man, that's
how Canadians roll.


133
0:7:16,613 --> 0:7:17,611
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, it is.


134
0:7:17,611 --> 0:7:19,108
MALE SPEAKER: He's making
an entrance.


135
0:7:19,108 --> 0:7:28,59



136
0:7:28,59 --> 0:7:30,65
HARVEY FOSTER: I don't think I
was fanning out, but in my


137
0:7:30,65 --> 0:7:32,27
head I was fanning out.


138
0:7:32,27 --> 0:7:34,24
Because he knows that
I've always been


139
0:7:34,24 --> 0:7:35,41
fucking stoked on that.


140
0:7:35,41 --> 0:7:38,64
Like I was down from
a young age.


141
0:7:38,64 --> 0:7:41,2
I think I probably even asked
him when I lived here, like


142
0:7:41,2 --> 0:7:43,37
when I moved, where's Keegan?


143
0:7:43,37 --> 0:7:44,78
Do you guys hang out
with that guy?


144
0:7:44,78 --> 0:7:46,98
I want to see that guy
skate in person.


145
0:7:46,98 --> 0:7:48,588
KEEGAN SAUDER: Harvey!


146
0:7:48,588 --> 0:7:50,22
KEEGAN SAUDER: Hey, man.


147
0:7:50,22 --> 0:7:56,4
Harvey is El Diablo, and Ky is
calm, cool, collected and


148
0:7:56,4 --> 0:7:58,76
really pale and sensitive
to mosquito bites.


149
0:7:58,76 --> 0:8:1,24
They're from the same town
that I lived in.


150
0:8:1,24 --> 0:8:5,68
But I moved away and then met
them later on going back to


151
0:8:5,68 --> 0:8:7,59
visit Victoria.


152
0:8:7,59 --> 0:8:11,52
HARVEY FOSTER: And now that I
know him as a good person, I'm


153
0:8:11,52 --> 0:8:15,0
so 100% behind everything
that he does.


154
0:8:15,0 --> 0:8:18,3
Like, I'll buy his board to
throw on my wall probably.


155
0:8:18,3 --> 0:8:20,84
And I hope every other fucking
Canadian kid does.


156
0:8:20,84 --> 0:8:24,38
KEEGAN SAUDER: I hung up
my crown as man am,


157
0:8:24,38 --> 0:8:26,63
and became man pro--


158
0:8:26,63 --> 0:8:27,96
major turning point.


159
0:8:27,96 --> 0:8:30,82
The premiere was the
29th, and everyone


160
0:8:30,82 --> 0:8:32,549
else left on the 27th.


161
0:8:32,549 --> 0:8:35,57
But it became pretty obvious
that the zero video had to


162
0:8:35,57 --> 0:8:38,95
take priority over anything
happening--


163
0:8:38,95 --> 0:8:41,51
which is good and
now it's done.


164
0:8:41,51 --> 0:8:43,559
And this trip happened,
so this is like a


165
0:8:43,559 --> 0:8:44,809
vacation after that.


166
0:8:44,809 --> 0:9:1,14



167
0:9:1,14 --> 0:9:4,535
The first day of riding entailed
a lot of riding.


168
0:9:4,535 --> 0:9:8,905
We started in Encinitas, rode to
Cuatro Casas, met you guys


169
0:9:8,905 --> 0:9:9,52
on the highway.


170
0:9:9,52 --> 0:9:12,6
And I think rode the same
distance again, like another


171
0:9:12,6 --> 0:9:15,86
200 and something miles
again with you guys.


172
0:9:15,86 --> 0:9:19,654
Which was fine, because
it was really fun.


173
0:9:19,654 --> 0:9:21,49
PATRICK O'DELL: You
know, a 350 mile


174
0:9:21,49 --> 0:9:23,226
ride pretty much sucks.


175
0:9:23,226 --> 0:9:26,86
And so it was cool to look
over and see Arto and see


176
0:9:26,86 --> 0:9:31,284
Keegan and everyone
still psyched.


177
0:9:31,284 --> 0:9:35,17
KEEGAN SAUDER: I'm a motorcycle
racing fan, so I


178
0:9:35,17 --> 0:9:37,24
like to pretend that I'm one.


179
0:9:37,24 --> 0:9:38,886
So I do like corners a lot.


180
0:9:38,886 --> 0:9:44,67



181
0:9:44,67 --> 0:9:46,9
BILL BRYANT: The long stretches
have tons of turns,


182
0:9:46,9 --> 0:9:50,45
and you can just wipe out in
any one of those turns.


183
0:9:50,45 --> 0:9:53,23
Some of them are just like
racetracks, and if you can see


184
0:9:53,23 --> 0:9:56,3
two or three turns deep it's
fun because you know what's


185
0:9:56,3 --> 0:9:58,74
coming or what's not coming, and
you just lay down and go


186
0:9:58,74 --> 0:10:0,0
as fast as you can
possibly go.


187
0:10:0,0 --> 0:10:2,35
But the ones that are blind,
which is the majority of them,


188
0:10:2,35 --> 0:10:4,115
there's just always the
potential that somebody's


189
0:10:4,115 --> 0:10:7,1
going to be coming over that
line and coming after you.


190
0:10:7,1 --> 0:10:10,368



191
0:10:10,368 --> 0:10:13,2
KEEGAN SAUDER: Probably the most
mentally difficult would


192
0:10:13,2 --> 0:10:17,17
just be the insanely long
straight stretches and stuff


193
0:10:17,17 --> 0:10:20,37
like that where it doesn't
actually seem like you're


194
0:10:20,37 --> 0:10:22,52
moving anywhere.


195
0:10:22,52 --> 0:10:26,86
You could just be sitting on
your bike staring ahead in a


196
0:10:26,86 --> 0:10:28,11
parking lot.


197
0:10:28,11 --> 0:10:53,78



198
0:10:53,78 --> 0:10:56,571
ARTO SAARI: There's our posse
of rebels right over there.


199
0:10:56,571 --> 0:10:59,565

0:10:59,565 --> 0:11:2,61



201
0:11:2,61 --> 0:11:4,47
KEEGAN SAUDER: Fuck,
man, Baja's big.


202
0:11:4,47 --> 0:11:7,44
You kind of forget about it.


203
0:11:7,44 --> 0:11:11,38
But then you're like what,
it's 1,000 miles long.


204
0:11:11,38 --> 0:11:17,91
ARTO SAARI: I thought it was
like 500 miles there and 500


205
0:11:17,91 --> 0:11:20,76
miles back.


206
0:11:20,76 --> 0:11:23,95
And then we got to the hotel and
they're like no, the round


207
0:11:23,95 --> 0:11:25,7
trip's 2,500.


208
0:11:25,7 --> 0:11:26,83
HIME HERBERT: You guys
from Victoria?


209
0:11:26,83 --> 0:11:27,1
KYNAN TAIT: Yeah.


210
0:11:27,1 --> 0:11:27,77
HIME HERBERT: The island?


211
0:11:27,77 --> 0:11:28,502
KYNAN TAIT: Yeah.


212
0:11:28,502 --> 0:11:30,8
HIME HERBERT: That place
is awesome, man.


213
0:11:30,8 --> 0:11:33,31
It's like going back
in time, kind of.


214
0:11:33,31 --> 0:11:34,49
PATRICK O'DELL: You
work construction?


215
0:11:34,49 --> 0:11:38,16
KYNAN TAIT: No, we work around
this boat that we live on.


216
0:11:38,16 --> 0:11:41,34



217
0:11:41,34 --> 0:11:43,144
KYNAN TAIT: A security
guard by trade.


218
0:11:43,144 --> 0:11:45,92



219
0:11:45,92 --> 0:11:48,53
We live on a boat on a
construction site.


220
0:11:48,53 --> 0:11:51,69
And we get paid to do security
patrols of the construction


221
0:11:51,69 --> 0:11:53,755
site at night.


222
0:11:53,755 --> 0:11:55,2
KYNAN TAIT: And skim
the ponds.


223
0:11:55,2 --> 0:11:57,415
HIME HERBERT: Who watches the
construction site when you


224
0:11:57,415 --> 0:11:58,91
guys aren't there?


225
0:11:58,91 --> 0:12:1,5
KYNAN TAIT: Well, it's like
a pretty big place, so--


226
0:12:1,5 --> 0:12:8,21



227
0:12:8,21 --> 0:12:11,61
KYNAN TAIT: He got wasted
and went to spray it.


228
0:12:11,61 --> 0:12:14,94
And he had the thing backwards
and it sprayed and it went all


229
0:12:14,94 --> 0:12:16,37
down his hand.


230
0:12:16,37 --> 0:12:20,92
And then we went back in the
house and he comes running out


231
0:12:20,92 --> 0:12:23,34
of his room naked,
like running.


232
0:12:23,34 --> 0:12:28,13
He ran to the bathroom, then ran
to the shower, ran to the


233
0:12:28,13 --> 0:12:29,46
bathroom, ran to the shower.


234
0:12:29,46 --> 0:12:32,295
And I guess he had gone to his
room and tried to beat off and


235
0:12:32,295 --> 0:12:33,29
hadn't cleaned his hand.


236
0:12:33,29 --> 0:12:35,785
So he had bear spray
all over his hand.


237
0:12:35,785 --> 0:12:40,3
HIME HERBERT: Oh my God,
that is amazing.


238
0:12:40,3 --> 0:12:42,213
I'll get to that washing
off part later.


239
0:12:42,213 --> 0:12:43,975
KEEGAN SAUDER: Got
to go wash off.


240
0:12:43,975 --> 0:12:46,25
Oh no, boner!


241
0:12:46,25 --> 0:12:48,87
KYNAN TAIT: Basically.


242
0:12:48,87 --> 0:12:53,7
KEEGAN SAUDER: Only one way I
know to get rid of those.


243
0:12:53,7 --> 0:12:57,29
HIME HERBERT: Put pepper
spray on my cock.


244
0:12:57,29 --> 0:12:59,56
KYNAN TAIT: We're so
close [INAUDIBLE].


245
0:12:59,56 --> 0:13:3,685
KEEGAN SAUDER: So you guys are
living the dream over there?


246
0:13:3,685 --> 0:13:6,11
That's so rad.


247
0:13:6,11 --> 0:13:8,5
ARTO SAARI: And Ky's
the captain.


248
0:13:8,5 --> 0:13:9,2
HARVEY FOSTER: Yeah.


249
0:13:9,2 --> 0:13:11,16
ARTO SAARI: What are you?


250
0:13:11,16 --> 0:13:12,41
Cabin boy?


251
0:13:12,41 --> 0:15:12,41
