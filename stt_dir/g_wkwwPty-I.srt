CHRIS: I don't think Mutsuo
would ever talk about


3
0:0:20,58 --> 0:0:22,42
himself that much.


4
0:0:22,42 --> 0:0:27,79
He's a very unassuming
kind of guy.


5
0:0:27,79 --> 0:0:29,44
You'd meet him and you'd
be like, ah, he's a


6
0:0:29,44 --> 0:0:31,51
really nice, quiet guy.


7
0:0:31,51 --> 0:0:32,835
And he's not a hustler.


8
0:0:32,835 --> 0:0:37,39
He's just really dedicated to
tattooing as an artist.


9
0:0:37,39 --> 0:0:40,77



10
0:0:40,77 --> 0:0:43,35
He'd learn how to tattoo
everything.


11
0:0:43,35 --> 0:0:44,56
Kind of like in the
United States.


12
0:0:44,56 --> 0:0:47,74
In the '90s, you just tattooed
whatever came in the door.


13
0:0:47,74 --> 0:0:51,46
He kind of got an American
'90s tattoo education.


14
0:0:51,46 --> 0:0:55,57
He's probably the first person
in Japan to get that.


15
0:0:55,57 --> 0:0:57,614
He's a maverick.


16
0:0:57,614 --> 0:0:58,598
MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): And
he doesn't even know.


17
0:0:58,598 --> 0:1:0,74

CHRIS: Mutsuo, he's like
a walking artist.


28
0:2:23,25 --> 0:2:27,6
I don't know if he has any
weaknesses at this point.


29
0:2:27,6 --> 0:2:31,96
Everything I see him do
looks totally legit.


30
0:2:31,96 --> 0:2:35,73
He started tattooing, I
guess, in 2000, 2001.


31
0:2:35,73 --> 0:2:38,98
Yeah, I can't believe that he's
been tattooing for like


32
0:2:38,98 --> 0:2:40,8
13 years now.


33
0:2:40,8 --> 0:2:42,4
Yeah, time goes by
so quick, but.


34
0:2:42,4 --> 0:2:45,745
Mutsuo is like the foundation
at Three Tides now.

63
0:9:54,13 --> 0:9:58,54
CHRIS: When Three Tides started,
it was a very new


64
0:9:58,54 --> 0:10:2,43
concept in Japan to have a
Western style shop where you


65
0:10:2,43 --> 0:10:4,85
could get to go in
and you could get


66
0:10:4,85 --> 0:10:6,49
almost any type of tattoo.


67
0:10:6,49 --> 0:10:9,4
It wasn't necessarily a
Japanese-style tattoo.


68
0:10:9,4 --> 0:10:11,98
It could be an American
traditional, or a single


69
0:10:11,98 --> 0:10:16,65
needle black and gray, or
Japanese, maybe like just a


70
0:10:16,65 --> 0:10:18,84
dragon on your arm.


71
0:10:18,84 --> 0:10:21,3
I think a lot of people that
were young, whether they were


72
0:10:21,3 --> 0:10:23,84
into skateboarding or rock and
roll, I think a lot of them


73
0:10:23,84 --> 0:10:27,8
would be intimidated to go to a
traditional tattoo shop and


74
0:10:27,8 --> 0:10:28,68
be like, I want to
get a panther.


75
0:10:28,68 --> 0:10:31,2
It would be just something
that wasn't really


76
0:10:31,2 --> 0:10:32,8
done at that time.


77
0:10:32,8 --> 0:10:37,78
That was a niche Three Tides
filled for a lot of people.


78
0:10:37,78 --> 0:10:40,13
Something that they saw in an
American tattoo magazine they


79
0:10:40,13 --> 0:10:41,8
could get done in Japan without
having to travel to


80
0:10:41,8 --> 0:10:44,17
the United States or Europe
or something like that.
