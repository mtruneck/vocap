0:0:11,36 --> 0:0:15,169
Bigger welcome!
Hello, San Francisco!


2
0:0:15,169 --> 0:0:18,705
TEDx – oh my God, blinding light!


3
0:0:18,705 --> 0:0:20,741
Hi, everybody! How are you?


4
0:0:20,741 --> 0:0:23,905
(Audience cheering) Fine?!
Oh my gosh! Okay, so...


5
0:0:23,905 --> 0:0:27,872
My name is Mel Robbins,
and for the last seventeen years,


6
0:0:27,872 --> 0:0:35,531
I have done nothing but help people
get everything that they want.


7
0:0:35,531 --> 0:0:38,67
Within reason! My husband's here.


8
0:0:38,67 --> 0:0:44,73
So, I've done it in the courtroom,
in the boardroom, in the bedroom,


9
0:0:44,73 --> 0:0:47,604
in people's living room,
whatever room you want to be in,


10
0:0:47,604 --> 0:0:52,28
if I'm there, I will help you get whatever
you want by any means necessary.


11
0:0:52,28 --> 0:0:56,471
For the last three years –
I host a syndicated radio show.


12
0:0:56,471 --> 0:0:59,198
Five days a week,
I go live in forty cities


13
0:0:59,198 --> 0:1:3,426
and I talk to men and women
across America who feel stuck.


14
0:1:3,426 --> 0:1:11,434
Do you know that a third of Americans
feel dissatisfied with their lives right now?


15
0:1:11,434 --> 0:1:15,906
That is a hundred million people!


16
0:1:15,906 --> 0:1:18,601
That's insane!


17
0:1:18,601 --> 0:1:21,683
And I've come face to face with it
in this new show that I'm doing,


18
0:1:21,683 --> 0:1:24,435
which is also insane,
it's called "In-laws".


19
0:1:24,435 --> 0:1:29,426
I move in with families across America –
(Laughter)


20
0:1:29,426 --> 0:1:31,711
You guessed it!


21
0:1:31,711 --> 0:1:35,35
– who are at war with their in-laws.


22
0:1:35,35 --> 0:1:40,518
We move them into the same house,
I verbally assassinate everybody,


23
0:1:40,518 --> 0:1:42,949
we open up Pandora's box,


24
0:1:42,949 --> 0:1:46,158
and I get people to stop arguing
about the donuts


25
0:1:46,158 --> 0:1:47,989
and who is hosting
Thanksgiving dinner,


26
0:1:47,989 --> 0:1:51,41
and talk about the real stuff.


27
0:1:51,41 --> 0:1:54,36
And that's what I want
to talk to you about.


28
0:1:54,36 --> 0:1:56,439
I'm here for you.


29
0:1:56,439 --> 0:2:0,369
I'm going to tell you everything I know
in less than eighteen minutes


30
0:2:0,369 --> 0:2:2,733
about how to get what you want.


31
0:2:2,733 --> 0:2:5,9
So I want you to take
a millisecond right now


32
0:2:5,9 --> 0:2:6,837
and think about what you want.


33
0:2:6,837 --> 0:2:8,485
You!


34
0:2:8,485 --> 0:2:10,439
And I want you to be selfish.


35
0:2:10,439 --> 0:2:13,537
Screw Simon and the "We" thing.
This is about me, right now!


36
0:2:13,537 --> 0:2:17,95
(Laughter) (Applause)
Sorry, Simon.


37
0:2:17,95 --> 0:2:21,427
What do you want?
And here's the deal.


38
0:2:21,427 --> 0:2:24,76
I don't want it to sound good
to other people.


39
0:2:24,76 --> 0:2:28,761
Being healthy will not get your ass
on a treadmill.


40
0:2:28,761 --> 0:2:32,122
Losing your manboobs,
so you can hook up with somebody,


41
0:2:32,122 --> 0:2:35,575
now that's motivation.
(Laughter)


42
0:2:35,575 --> 0:2:39,75
So, I want to know: What do you want?


43
0:2:39,75 --> 0:2:43,252
Do you want to lose weight?
Do you want to triple your income?


44
0:2:43,252 --> 0:2:47,71
Do you want to start a nonprofit?
Do you want to find love?


45
0:2:47,71 --> 0:2:49,168
What is it? Get it, right here.


46
0:2:49,168 --> 0:2:52,737
You know what it is, don't analyze it
to death, just pick something.


47
0:2:52,737 --> 0:2:57,569
That's part of the problem.
You won't pick.


48
0:2:57,569 --> 0:3:3,4
So, we're going to be talking about
how you get what you want.


49
0:3:3,4 --> 0:3:8,472
And frankly, getting what you want
is simple.


50
0:3:8,472 --> 0:3:12,278
But notice I didn't say it was easy.


51
0:3:12,278 --> 0:3:14,565
It's very simple.


52
0:3:14,565 --> 0:3:18,151
In fact, if you think about it,


53
0:3:18,151 --> 0:3:21,472
we live in the most amazing
moment in time.


54
0:3:21,472 --> 0:3:25,324
So that thing that you have up here,
whatever it may be,


55
0:3:25,324 --> 0:3:28,746
you want to use healthy eating
to cure your diabetes,


56
0:3:28,746 --> 0:3:32,606
you want to figure out
how to take care of the elders


57
0:3:32,606 --> 0:3:34,556
and start a new hospice center,


58
0:3:34,556 --> 0:3:38,138
you want to move to Africa
and build a school... Guess what?


59
0:3:38,138 --> 0:3:41,24
You can walk into a book store
– right now! –


60
0:3:41,24 --> 0:3:44,928
and buy at least ten books
written by credentialed experts


61
0:3:44,928 --> 0:3:46,906
on how the hell you do it.


62
0:3:46,906 --> 0:3:48,919
You could Google it.


63
0:3:48,919 --> 0:3:54,2
And you could probably find at least,
I don't know - a thousand blogs


64
0:3:54,2 --> 0:3:57,165
documenting the step, by step,
by step transformation


65
0:3:57,165 --> 0:3:59,963
that somebody else is already doing.


66
0:3:59,963 --> 0:4:4,52
You can find anybody online
and cyber-stalk them!


67
0:4:4,52 --> 0:4:6,3
(Laughter)


68
0:4:6,3 --> 0:4:10,353
You can just walk in their footsteps –
just use the science of drafting.


69
0:4:10,353 --> 0:4:14,267
Follow what everyone else has done,
because somebody is already doing it!


70
0:4:14,267 --> 0:4:16,956
So why don't you have what you want,


71
0:4:16,956 --> 0:4:19,645
when you have all the information
that you need,


72
0:4:19,645 --> 0:4:22,334
you have the contacts that you need,


73
0:4:22,334 --> 0:4:26,115
there are probably free tools online
that allow you to start a business,


74
0:4:26,115 --> 0:4:30,944
or join a group, or do whatever
the heck you want!?


75
0:4:30,944 --> 0:4:33,696
It all comes down to one word:


76
0:4:33,696 --> 0:4:38,564
F*©#.


77
0:4:38,564 --> 0:4:42,778
Shut the front door,
you know what I'm talking about?


78
0:4:42,778 --> 0:4:46,714
The f-bomb. It's everywhere!


79
0:4:46,714 --> 0:4:48,318
You hear it all the time!


80
0:4:48,318 --> 0:4:51,701
I honestly don't understand
what the appeal is of the word.


81
0:4:51,701 --> 0:4:54,938
I mean, you don't sound smart
when you say it.


82
0:4:54,938 --> 0:5:0,267
And it's really not expressing
how you really feel.


83
0:5:0,267 --> 0:5:3,801
It's sort of a cheap shot to take.


84
0:5:3,801 --> 0:5:9,633
And of course you know
I'm talking about the word "fine".


85
0:5:9,633 --> 0:5:12,301
"How you doing?"
"Oh, I'm fine."


86
0:5:12,301 --> 0:5:14,442
Oh, really? You are?


87
0:5:14,442 --> 0:5:17,765
Dragging around those extra
forty pounds, you're fine?


88
0:5:17,765 --> 0:5:20,888
Feeling like roommates with your spouse,
and you're fine?


89
0:5:20,888 --> 0:5:23,852
You haven't had sex in four months,
you're fine?


90
0:5:23,852 --> 0:5:26,768
Really?!


91
0:5:26,768 --> 0:5:29,1
I don't think so!


92
0:5:29,1 --> 0:5:34,9
But see, here's the deal with saying
that you're fine: It's actually genius.


93
0:5:34,9 --> 0:5:39,496
Because if you're fine,
you don't have to do anything about it.


94
0:5:39,496 --> 0:5:44,999
But when you think about this word "fine",
it just makes me so angry.


95
0:5:44,999 --> 0:5:46,999
Here we are at a conference
about being alive


96
0:5:46,999 --> 0:5:52,292
and you're going to describe
the experience of being alive as "fine"?!


97
0:5:52,292 --> 0:5:55,792
What a flimsy and feeble word!


98
0:5:55,792 --> 0:5:57,466
If you're crappy, say you're crappy!


99
0:5:57,466 --> 0:5:59,691
If you're amazing say you're amazing!


100
0:5:59,691 --> 0:6:1,423
Tell the truth!


101
0:6:1,423 --> 0:6:4,717
And this not only goes
for the social construct:


102
0:6:4,717 --> 0:6:7,23
"Oh, I don't want to burden you
with the fact that I hate my life",


103
0:6:7,23 --> 0:6:10,3
or: "Hey, I'm amazing! But that
would make you feel terrible."


104
0:6:10,3 --> 0:6:12,6
The bigger issue –


105
0:6:12,6 --> 0:6:17,111
The bigger issue with "fine"
is that you say it to yourself.


106
0:6:17,111 --> 0:6:20,665
That thing that you want,
I guarantee you,


107
0:6:20,665 --> 0:6:26,471
you've convinced yourself
that you're fine not having it.


108
0:6:26,471 --> 0:6:28,957
That's why you're not pushing yourself.


109
0:6:28,957 --> 0:6:31,446
It's the areas in your life
where you've given up.


110
0:6:31,446 --> 0:6:32,845
Where you've said,


111
0:6:32,845 --> 0:6:35,9
"Oh, I'm fine.
My mom's never going to change,


112
0:6:35,9 --> 0:6:37,208
so I just can't have that conversation."


113
0:6:37,208 --> 0:6:40,84
"I'm fine. We've got to wait until
the kids graduate, before we get divorced,


114
0:6:40,84 --> 0:6:43,735
so we'll just sleep in separate bedrooms."


115
0:6:43,735 --> 0:6:46,696
"I'm fine. I lost my job,
I can barely pay my bills,


116
0:6:46,696 --> 0:6:51,517
but whatever – It's hard to get a job."


117
0:6:51,517 --> 0:6:57,96
One of the reasons why this word also just
annoys me so much is,


118
0:6:57,96 --> 0:7:1,363
scientists have calculated –


119
0:7:1,363 --> 0:7:3,33
Oh yeah, I'm coming down!
(Laughter)


120
0:7:3,33 --> 0:7:5,964
Scientists have calculated


121
0:7:5,964 --> 0:7:8,242
the odds


122
0:7:8,242 --> 0:7:9,988
of you


123
0:7:9,988 --> 0:7:12,808
being born.


124
0:7:12,808 --> 0:7:17,136
That's right. They've crunched
the numbers. I see you up there.


125
0:7:17,136 --> 0:7:18,962
They've crunched the numbers on you –


126
0:7:18,962 --> 0:7:22,32
Yeah, you guys standing up,
you want to sit down for this.


127
0:7:22,32 --> 0:7:25,261
They've crunched the numbers
on you being born.


128
0:7:25,261 --> 0:7:29,822
And they took into account
all of the wars,


129
0:7:29,822 --> 0:7:33,96
and the natural disasters,
and the dinosaurs,


130
0:7:33,96 --> 0:7:35,654
and everything else.


131
0:7:35,654 --> 0:7:41,559
And do you realize that the odds,
the odds of you,


132
0:7:41,559 --> 0:7:43,645
yeah, right here,
put your computer away,


133
0:7:43,645 --> 0:7:47,93
stand up for me, Doug!
(Laughter)


134
0:7:47,93 --> 0:7:50,493
So the odds of Doug here,
turn around, say "hi" to everybody –


135
0:7:50,493 --> 0:7:54,771
the odds of Doug being born


136
0:7:54,771 --> 0:7:57,292
at the moment in time he was born,


137
0:7:57,292 --> 0:8:3,328
to the parents you were born to,
with the DNA structure that you have,


138
0:8:3,328 --> 0:8:8,993
one in four hundred trillion!


139
0:8:8,993 --> 0:8:11,244
Isn't that amazing?
Doug: I'm so lucky!


140
0:8:11,244 --> 0:8:15,46
Mel: Yes! You're not fine,
you're fantastic!


141
0:8:15,46 --> 0:8:21,826
You have life-changing ideas for a reason,
and it's not to torture yourself.


142
0:8:21,826 --> 0:8:26,193
Thank you. Thank you, Doug.
(Applause)


143
0:8:26,193 --> 0:8:30,328
Christine was right when she said
all of you could be on stage.


144
0:8:30,328 --> 0:8:33,37
Because all of you
– we're all in this category.


145
0:8:33,37 --> 0:8:37,463
One in four hundred trillion.


146
0:8:37,463 --> 0:8:41,743
All day long you have ideas
that could change your life,


147
0:8:41,743 --> 0:8:45,744
that could change the world,
that could change the way that you feel,


148
0:8:45,744 --> 0:8:49,77
and what do you do with them?
Nothing!


149
0:8:49,77 --> 0:8:52,381
(Grunts) Hopefully I won't moon you.
(Laughter)


150
0:8:52,381 --> 0:8:58,603
You didn't pay for that.
(Laughter)


151
0:8:58,603 --> 0:9:3,92
And I want you to just think for a minute,
because we all have –


152
0:9:3,92 --> 0:9:6,728
I love to use the analogy
"the inner snooze button" –


153
0:9:6,728 --> 0:9:9,78
you have these amazing ideas
that bubble up.


154
0:9:9,78 --> 0:9:10,898
You've been watching people all day


155
0:9:10,898 --> 0:9:15,819
and I guarantee you,
like ping pong balls – bam-bam-bam


156
0:9:15,819 --> 0:9:19,851
and everytime you have an idea,
what do you do? – Hit the snooze!


157
0:9:19,851 --> 0:9:22,92
What's the first decision
you made this morning?


158
0:9:22,92 --> 0:9:26,46
I bet it was to go back to bed.


159
0:9:26,46 --> 0:9:30,9
"Yeah, first decision today,
I'm one in four hundred trillion,


160
0:9:30,9 --> 0:9:32,62
I'm going to go back to sleep."


161
0:9:32,62 --> 0:9:37,351
And I get it! Your bed is comfortable!
It's cosy, it's warm!


162
0:9:37,351 --> 0:9:40,794
If you're lucky, you've got somebody
that you love next to you,


163
0:9:40,794 --> 0:9:47,932
or in my case, I've got my husband
and my two kids and possibly the dog.


164
0:9:47,932 --> 0:9:52,865
And the reason why I'm bringing up
this first decision that you made today,


165
0:9:52,865 --> 0:9:57,771
and the inner snooze alarm,
is because


166
0:9:57,771 --> 0:10:3,466
in any area of your life
that you want to change,


167
0:10:3,466 --> 0:10:7,583
any – there's one fact
that you need to know.


168
0:10:7,583 --> 0:10:12,53
This one:


169
0:10:12,53 --> 0:10:16,743
You are never going to feel like it.


170
0:10:16,743 --> 0:10:19,29
Ever.


171
0:10:19,29 --> 0:10:22,495
No one's coming,
motivation isn't happening,


172
0:10:22,495 --> 0:10:24,961
you're never going to feel like it.


173
0:10:24,961 --> 0:10:27,929
Scientists call it activation energy.


174
0:10:27,929 --> 0:10:30,487
That's what they call the force required


175
0:10:30,487 --> 0:10:32,658
to get you to change
from what you're doing


176
0:10:32,658 --> 0:10:34,829
on autopilot to do something new.


177
0:10:34,829 --> 0:10:37,0
So try this test tomorrow.


178
0:10:37,0 --> 0:10:40,663
You think you're so fancy,
I know, you're attending TED.


179
0:10:40,663 --> 0:10:43,365
(Laughter)
Try this.


180
0:10:43,365 --> 0:10:48,769
Tomorrow morning, set your alarm
for thirty minutes earlier.


181
0:10:48,769 --> 0:10:51,894
And then when it goes off,
take those sheets,


182
0:10:51,894 --> 0:10:56,734
throw them off, and stand up
and start your day.


183
0:10:56,734 --> 0:10:59,153
No snooze, no delay,


184
0:10:59,153 --> 0:11:3,852
no, "I'll just wait here for five seconds
because Mel's not standing here" –


185
0:11:3,852 --> 0:11:5,231
Do it.


186
0:11:5,231 --> 0:11:10,564
And the reason why I want you to do it
is because you will come face to face


187
0:11:10,564 --> 0:11:14,642
with the physical,
and I mean physical force


188
0:11:14,642 --> 0:11:19,43
that's required to change your behavior.


189
0:11:19,43 --> 0:11:23,175
Do you think that somebody
who needs to lose weight


190
0:11:23,175 --> 0:11:25,306
ever feels like going on a diet?


191
0:11:25,306 --> 0:11:27,344
Of course not!


192
0:11:27,344 --> 0:11:30,99
You think they ever feel like eating
boiled chicken and peas


193
0:11:30,99 --> 0:11:32,636
instead of a croissant?


194
0:11:32,636 --> 0:11:35,284
I don't think so!


195
0:11:35,284 --> 0:11:37,778
The activation energy


196
0:11:37,778 --> 0:11:43,149
required to get your ass away
from your computer and out the front door,


197
0:11:43,149 --> 0:11:46,228
to go on the walk, you said
that you were going to go on,


198
0:11:46,228 --> 0:11:49,45
is the exact same amount of force
that it takes you


199
0:11:49,45 --> 0:11:54,367
to push yourself out of a warm bed
and into a cold room.


200
0:11:54,367 --> 0:11:57,51
What's interesting about being an adult


201
0:11:57,51 --> 0:12:1,11
is that when you become eighteen,


202
0:12:1,11 --> 0:12:7,896
nobody tells you that it's now
going to be your job to parent yourself.


203
0:12:7,896 --> 0:12:9,704
And by "parent yourself",


204
0:12:9,704 --> 0:12:15,455
I mean it's your job to make yourself
do the crap you don't want to do,


205
0:12:15,455 --> 0:12:20,728
so you can be everything
that you're supposed to be.


206
0:12:20,728 --> 0:12:24,929
And you're so damn busy
waiting to feel like it.


207
0:12:24,929 --> 0:12:26,786
And you're never going to!


208
0:12:26,786 --> 0:12:30,62
My son never feels like getting off his DS.
That's my job!


209
0:12:30,62 --> 0:12:33,194
Get off the damn DS!


210
0:12:33,194 --> 0:12:35,663
Kendall, clean up the Barbies!


211
0:12:35,663 --> 0:12:39,93
If you're going to have a nude party
in my bathroom, at least clean it up!


212
0:12:39,93 --> 0:12:42,901
(Laughter)


213
0:12:42,901 --> 0:12:48,466
God, chew with your mouth closed!
We're not a barn, for crying out loud!


214
0:12:48,466 --> 0:12:54,673
Alright, dinner is coming,
get out of the pantry.


215
0:12:54,673 --> 0:12:57,273
As parents, and you were a kid,


216
0:12:57,273 --> 0:13:0,599
your parents make you do the things
you don't feel like doing.


217
0:13:0,599 --> 0:13:3,733
Because you won't. Ever.


218
0:13:3,733 --> 0:13:7,529
Not now, not then, not ever!


219
0:13:7,529 --> 0:13:9,418
And even when you get good at something,


220
0:13:9,418 --> 0:13:11,975
you'll figure out something else
you don't want to do.


221
0:13:11,975 --> 0:13:15,862
And then you'll plato out, get bored,
"I hate this job. Blah blah boring."


222
0:13:15,862 --> 0:13:19,337
But will you look for a new one?
No! You'll just bitch about that one.


223
0:13:19,337 --> 0:13:23,595
It's very, very simple
to get what you want.


224
0:13:23,595 --> 0:13:28,633
But it's not easy.


225
0:13:28,633 --> 0:13:32,867
You have to force yourself.


226
0:13:32,867 --> 0:13:36,263
And I mean force.


227
0:13:36,263 --> 0:13:38,403
And the reason why
I use the word "force" –


228
0:13:38,403 --> 0:13:42,683
when Roz was up here
and talking about the emotion tracking,


229
0:13:42,683 --> 0:13:45,785
and she had the picture
of two sides of the brain –


230
0:13:45,785 --> 0:13:49,134
I look at the brain the exact same way.


231
0:13:49,134 --> 0:13:52,401
Only I describe one side
of your brain as autopilot


232
0:13:52,401 --> 0:13:54,725
and the other side as emergency brake.


233
0:13:54,725 --> 0:13:58,937
That's the only two speeds you get:
autopilot, emergency brake.


234
0:13:58,937 --> 0:14:2,796
And guess which one your brain
likes better: autopilot.


235
0:14:2,796 --> 0:14:5,73
You've had the experience where
you've driven to work and you get there


236
0:14:5,73 --> 0:14:8,484
and you're like, "Oh my God,
I don't remember ever driving here."


237
0:14:8,484 --> 0:14:9,443
(Laughter)


238
0:14:9,443 --> 0:14:13,354
You weren't drunk!
That was your brain on autopilot.


239
0:14:13,354 --> 0:14:16,464
It was functioning just at this level.


240
0:14:16,464 --> 0:14:19,335
And the problem with your mind
is that anytime


241
0:14:19,335 --> 0:14:22,852
you do anything that's different
from your normal routine,


242
0:14:22,852 --> 0:14:26,189
guess what your brain does —
emergency brake!


243
0:14:26,189 --> 0:14:29,33
And it has that reaction for everything.
Everything!


244
0:14:29,33 --> 0:14:30,975
You walk into the kitchen
and see


245
0:14:30,975 --> 0:14:33,291
everybody's left their breakfast
dishes for you.


246
0:14:33,291 --> 0:14:36,232
And you think for the hundredth time,
"I'm going to kill them.


247
0:14:36,232 --> 0:14:39,998
In fact I'm gonna leave it here
and I'm going to make them do it."


248
0:14:39,998 --> 0:14:42,354
But that's not your normal routine, is it?


249
0:14:42,354 --> 0:14:44,462
So your mind goes: emergency brake!


250
0:14:44,462 --> 0:14:46,12
And you go right into autopilot.


251
0:14:46,12 --> 0:14:48,753
"I'll just load it, and be pissed,
and then not have sex.


252
0:14:48,753 --> 0:14:54,669
That's what I'm going to do."
(Laughter) (Applause)


253
0:14:54,669 --> 0:14:56,868
So, when I say "force",


254
0:14:56,868 --> 0:15:2,18
anything that's a break from your routine
is going to require force.


255
0:15:2,18 --> 0:15:4,556
And if you think about your life,


256
0:15:4,556 --> 0:15:9,167
it's kind of funny because we are kids
and then we become adults,


257
0:15:9,167 --> 0:15:11,407
and we spend so much time
trying to push our life


258
0:15:11,407 --> 0:15:13,647
into some sort of stable routine,


259
0:15:13,647 --> 0:15:15,888
and then we grow bored of it!


260
0:15:15,888 --> 0:15:19,506
You wake up at the same time every day,
you have largely the same breakfast,


261
0:15:19,506 --> 0:15:22,47
you drive to work the same way,
show up at work, look busy,


262
0:15:22,47 --> 0:15:24,845
avoid making calls,
update Facebook,


263
0:15:24,845 --> 0:15:27,22
you attend a meeting
and doodle the whole time,


264
0:15:27,22 --> 0:15:29,865
go back and update Facebook,
make plans for the evening,


265
0:15:29,865 --> 0:15:32,387
you look busy some more,
then drive home the same way,


266
0:15:32,387 --> 0:15:34,962
you eat largely the same dinner
or a variety of it,


267
0:15:34,962 --> 0:15:36,873
you watch the same kind of media,


268
0:15:36,873 --> 0:15:39,642
and then you go to bed,
and do the same thing all over again!


269
0:15:39,642 --> 0:15:41,909
No wonder you're bored out
of your mind!


270
0:15:41,909 --> 0:15:44,659
It's the routine that's killing you.


271
0:15:44,659 --> 0:15:48,75
I have this theory about
why people get stuck in life.


272
0:15:48,75 --> 0:15:51,893
So, most of you've probably taken
your Basic Psych 101 class,


273
0:15:51,893 --> 0:15:56,515
and you've bumped into
Abraham Maslow's "Hierarchy of Needs"?


274
0:15:56,515 --> 0:16:1,893
Well, your body is kinda cool.
Because you have these basic needs.


275
0:16:1,893 --> 0:16:6,66
And your body is wired
to send you signals.


276
0:16:6,66 --> 0:16:11,205
If you need food, what do you feel?


277
0:16:11,205 --> 0:16:14,187
If you need water, what do you feel?


278
0:16:14,187 --> 0:16:20,295
If you need sex, what do you feel?
(Laughter) Thank you.


279
0:16:20,295 --> 0:16:24,538
I think when you feel stuck
or dissatisfied in your life,


280
0:16:24,538 --> 0:16:26,959
it's a signal.


281
0:16:26,959 --> 0:16:30,293
And it's not a signal
that your life is broken.


282
0:16:30,293 --> 0:16:35,231
It's a signal that one of your most
basic needs are not being met.


283
0:16:35,231 --> 0:16:37,611
Your need for exploration.


284
0:16:37,611 --> 0:16:41,27
Everything about your life,
about your body, grows!


285
0:16:41,27 --> 0:16:43,941
Your cells regenerate,
your hair, your nails,


286
0:16:43,941 --> 0:16:47,236
everything grows for your entire life.


287
0:16:47,236 --> 0:16:51,6
And your soul needs exploration
and growth.


288
0:16:51,6 --> 0:16:57,694
And the only way you'll get it is
by forcing yourself to be uncomfortable.


289
0:16:57,694 --> 0:17:2,583
Forcing yourself to get outside,


290
0:17:2,583 --> 0:17:4,734
out of your head.
Thank you.


291
0:17:4,734 --> 0:17:7,4
If you're in your head,
you're behind enemy lines.


292
0:17:7,4 --> 0:17:10,67
That is not God talking, okay?
It's not!


293
0:17:10,67 --> 0:17:14,496
In fact, if I put a speaker on it
and we broadcast what you say to yourself,


294
0:17:14,496 --> 0:17:18,322
we would institutionalize you.
(Laughter)


295
0:17:18,322 --> 0:17:20,699
You would not hang out with people
that talk to you


296
0:17:20,699 --> 0:17:22,815
the way you talk to yourself.


297
0:17:22,815 --> 0:17:25,455
So get out of your head!


298
0:17:25,455 --> 0:17:29,566
Your feelings!
Your feelings are screwing you!


299
0:17:29,566 --> 0:17:33,983
I don't care how you feel!
I care about what you want!


300
0:17:33,983 --> 0:17:36,827
And if you listen to how you feel,


301
0:17:36,827 --> 0:17:41,93
when it comes to what you want –
you will not get it.


302
0:17:41,93 --> 0:17:44,65
Because you will never feel like it.


303
0:17:44,65 --> 0:17:47,443
And you need to get outside
your comfort zone.


304
0:17:47,443 --> 0:17:49,694
It's not about taking risks,


305
0:17:49,694 --> 0:17:53,272
it's about getting outside
your comfort zone.


306
0:17:53,272 --> 0:17:58,815
Those first three seconds when
you push yourself out of bed, they blow.


307
0:17:58,815 --> 0:18:2,315
But once you're up, it's great.


308
0:18:2,315 --> 0:18:6,816
Those first three seconds when
you're sitting here in a stadium like this


309
0:18:6,816 --> 0:18:9,307
and somebody says,
"Get up and come dance,"


310
0:18:9,307 --> 0:18:11,798
and you think,
"Oh, I should do that,"


311
0:18:11,798 --> 0:18:14,29
and then you're like, "Uhmm."


312
0:18:14,29 --> 0:18:20,233
That experience that you had
when you had the impulse to do it


313
0:18:20,233 --> 0:18:23,867
and then you didn't do
the activation energy


314
0:18:23,867 --> 0:18:26,856
required to force yourself,


315
0:18:26,856 --> 0:18:29,613
your emergency brake got pulled –
"I'm sitting right here.


316
0:18:29,613 --> 0:18:34,422
I'm not going up with those
crazy people, I don't like to dance..."


317
0:18:34,422 --> 0:18:37,385
What happened for me is
I came up, and I bumped into Rachel,


318
0:18:37,385 --> 0:18:41,441
and then we started talking,
and next thing you know, she's tweeting.


319
0:18:41,441 --> 0:18:45,993
And we're friends.
And – boom! Get outside.


320
0:18:45,993 --> 0:18:47,832
That's where the magic is.


321
0:18:47,832 --> 0:18:54,181
That's where the one
in four hundred trillion exists.


322
0:18:54,181 --> 0:18:58,277
So everything I do –
oh, OK, this is the last part. Sorry.


323
0:18:58,277 --> 0:19:2,459
So one more thing that you can use,
I call it the five-second-rule.


324
0:19:2,459 --> 0:19:10,558
Your mind can process a facial expression
in 33 milliseconds.


325
0:19:10,558 --> 0:19:13,38
It can move pretty damn quick.


326
0:19:13,38 --> 0:19:16,262
The other thing that it does very quickly


327
0:19:16,262 --> 0:19:21,246
is if you have one of those little
impulses that are pulling you,


328
0:19:21,246 --> 0:19:25,49
if you don't marry it with an action
within five seconds,


329
0:19:25,49 --> 0:19:27,948
you pull the emergency brake
and kill the idea.


330
0:19:27,948 --> 0:19:29,622
Kill it!


331
0:19:29,622 --> 0:19:33,894
If you have the impulse to get up
and come dance while the band is playing,


332
0:19:33,894 --> 0:19:35,817
if you don't stand up in five seconds,


333
0:19:35,817 --> 0:19:38,766
you're going to pull
the emergency brake.


334
0:19:38,766 --> 0:19:41,13
If you have an impulse about,


335
0:19:41,13 --> 0:19:43,574
you were inspired by somebody's
speech today,


336
0:19:43,574 --> 0:19:46,105
and you don't do something
within five seconds


337
0:19:46,105 --> 0:19:49,43
– write a note, send yourself a text –


338
0:19:49,43 --> 0:19:52,189
anything physical to marry it
with the idea,


339
0:19:52,189 --> 0:19:56,873
you will pull the emergency brake
and kill the idea.


340
0:19:56,873 --> 0:20:0,796
Your problem isn't ideas.
Your problem is you don't act on them.


341
0:20:0,796 --> 0:20:6,28
You kill them. It's not my fault.
It's not anybody's fault.


342
0:20:6,28 --> 0:20:10,337
You're doing it to yourself.
Stop it!


343
0:20:10,337 --> 0:20:15,596
I'm counting on you.
One in four hundred trillion.


344
0:20:15,596 --> 0:20:17,633
You got stuff to do!


345
0:20:17,633 --> 0:20:20,627
And it's not going to happen
in your head.


346
0:20:20,627 --> 0:20:24,132
So I want you
to practice this today.


347
0:20:24,132 --> 0:20:26,534
When we go off to party,
thank God it's coming soon,


348
0:20:26,534 --> 0:20:30,489
because I think
we all could use a cocktail,


349
0:20:30,489 --> 0:20:33,653
I want you to practice
the five-second-rule.


350
0:20:33,653 --> 0:20:36,105
You see somebody and you think
you have an impulse,


351
0:20:36,105 --> 0:20:39,747
they look interesting?
Walk over there!


352
0:20:39,747 --> 0:20:42,365
You were inspired by somebody
and you have a request?


353
0:20:42,365 --> 0:20:44,119
Make it!


354
0:20:44,119 --> 0:20:48,285
That's why you're here!


355
0:20:48,285 --> 0:20:52,9
Experiment with it, and I think
you'll be shocked about what happens.


356
0:20:52,9 --> 0:20:56,421
And one more thing, I want you to know
that everything that I do,


357
0:20:56,421 --> 0:20:58,627
whether it's the radio show,
or the television show,


358
0:20:58,627 --> 0:21:1,342
or the book that I wrote,
or the column,


359
0:21:1,342 --> 0:21:3,22
it's for you.


360
0:21:3,22 --> 0:21:7,367
And if there is anything that I can do,


361
0:21:7,367 --> 0:21:12,865
if I can do anything to make you do
the things you don't want to do,


362
0:21:12,865 --> 0:21:16,731
so you can have what you want,
I will do it.


363
0:21:16,731 --> 0:21:20,541
But you need to walk over,
you need to open your mouth,


364
0:21:20,541 --> 0:21:22,763
and you need to make the request.


365
0:21:22,763 --> 0:21:26,494
You got it? Good.
Go do it.


366
0:21:26,494 --> 0:21:32,262
(Applause)


367
0:21:32,262 --> 0:21:35,606
Thank you! Thank you, yes!
Stand up!


368
0:21:35,606 --> 0:23:35,606
You have the impulse, stand up!
Thank you!
