1
0:0:0,934 --> 0:0:2,802
Travis Taylor: Now,
on Rocket City Rednecks.


2
0:0:2,802 --> 0:0:3,736
Watch out!


3
0:0:3,736 --> 0:0:5,471
Some mudslinging
adventure.


4
0:0:5,471 --> 0:0:6,839
God dang.


5
0:0:6,839 --> 0:0:8,507
Lead to our
craziest build yet.


6
0:0:8,507 --> 0:0:9,775
I designed it
but you didn't


7
0:0:9,775 --> 0:0:11,677
weld it for nothin'.


8
0:0:11,677 --> 0:0:14,747
But, will our wearable
transforming ATV


9
0:0:14,747 --> 0:0:17,349
stand up to the
ultimate redneck test?


10
0:0:17,349 --> 0:0:19,885
I've transformed
and I can't get up.


11
0:0:19,885 --> 0:0:21,954
Rog:<i> [laughing].</i>


12
0:0:21,954 --> 0:0:23,322
Travis Taylor:
I'm Travis Taylor.


13
0:0:23,322 --> 0:0:25,57
I'm a rocket scientist
in the space and defense


14
0:0:25,57 --> 0:0:26,625
industry here in
my hometown of


15
0:0:26,625 --> 0:0:28,327
Huntsville, Alabama,


16
0:0:28,327 --> 0:0:30,129
where my daddy
helped build the rockets


17
0:0:30,129 --> 0:0:31,497
that sent us to the moon.


18
0:0:31,497 --> 0:0:32,465
Daddy: Have y'all
been drinking


19
0:0:32,465 --> 0:0:34,266
the rocket fuel again?


20
0:0:34,266 --> 0:0:35,534
Travis Taylor:
Sometimes, big science


21
0:0:35,534 --> 0:0:37,36
moves too slow for me.


22
0:0:37,36 --> 0:0:38,137
So come the weekend,


23
0:0:38,137 --> 0:0:40,272
I round up my
best friend Rog.


24
0:0:40,272 --> 0:0:41,407
Rog: Hey!


25
0:0:41,407 --> 0:0:43,609
Travis Taylor: My nephew
Michael and my buddy Pete,


26
0:0:43,609 --> 0:0:45,77
to tackle
important problems with


27
0:0:45,77 --> 0:0:48,13
a little down-home ingenuity.


28
0:0:48,13 --> 0:0:52,718
Rog: Damn it, boy!


29
0:0:52,718 --> 0:0:53,752
Travis Taylor: Right on.


30
0:0:53,752 --> 0:0:58,624
Hey, is there any more
beers in the cooler?


31
0:0:58,624 --> 0:1:0,759
Sometimes we get the
inspiration for our


32
0:1:0,759 --> 0:1:4,697
projects in
unexpected places.


33
0:1:4,697 --> 0:1:6,565
Me and Rog and Michael
went down to this


34
0:1:6,565 --> 0:1:14,24
racecourse and man we've
been having a blast.


35
0:1:14,24 --> 0:1:16,175
All of a sudden every
time I give it throttle,


36
0:1:16,175 --> 0:1:18,31
it would just bog down and
stop and I got stuck right


37
0:1:18,31 --> 0:1:21,113
out there in the middle
of the mud and the water.


38
0:1:21,113 --> 0:1:22,248
Michael: You stuck
or something?


39
0:1:22,248 --> 0:1:23,582
Travis Taylor: Yeah, look.


40
0:1:23,582 --> 0:1:24,517
Michael: Look on
that other side and


41
0:1:24,517 --> 0:1:25,551
check your linkage.


42
0:1:25,551 --> 0:1:27,19
Travis Taylor: What
the hell is a linkage?


43
0:1:27,19 --> 0:1:28,42
Michael: The throttle
linkage I mean.


44
0:1:28,42 --> 0:1:29,555
You got a multi tool.


45
0:1:29,555 --> 0:1:30,689
Travis Taylor: Multi tool.


46
0:1:30,689 --> 0:1:34,426
Michael: Tighten them
thing up with them pliers.


47
0:1:34,426 --> 0:1:35,694
Travis Taylor: Well I
got it pulled loose,


48
0:1:35,694 --> 0:1:37,96
but now I need
a screwdriver.


49
0:1:37,96 --> 0:1:38,164
How do I get the
screwdriver out of this?


50
0:1:38,164 --> 0:1:39,231
Michael: I don't
know, I bet that


51
0:1:39,231 --> 0:1:40,132
multi tool has got one.


52
0:1:40,132 --> 0:1:41,233
Travis Taylor: Oh
look a transformer.


53
0:1:41,233 --> 0:1:42,801
Just like it's a
transformer, man,


54
0:1:42,801 --> 0:1:44,136
how do get in
there to it though?


55
0:1:44,136 --> 0:1:47,206
The multi tool, it was
a transforming tool


56
0:1:47,206 --> 0:1:50,476
and man that gave me
the idea right then.


57
0:1:50,476 --> 0:1:51,744
If I was a
multi tool, man,


58
0:1:51,744 --> 0:1:53,12
if I was stuck in
the mud, I just,


59
0:1:53,12 --> 0:1:54,246
I just change forms
whatever it is just


60
0:1:54,246 --> 0:1:55,347
get up and walk out.


61
0:1:55,347 --> 0:1:56,782
Rog: You are a multi tool.


62
0:1:56,782 --> 0:1:58,5
Travis Taylor:
Shut up, Rog.


63
0:1:58,5 --> 0:1:59,318
That's what we are going
to do this weekend;


64
0:1:59,318 --> 0:2:1,754
we can call daddy and
Pete and build us a


65
0:2:1,754 --> 0:2:4,356
transforming ATV
that would be bad.


66
0:2:4,356 --> 0:2:5,824
Michael: Yeah it would.


67
0:2:5,824 --> 0:2:7,126
Travis Taylor: What
are you doing?


68
0:2:7,126 --> 0:2:7,893
You better not.


69
0:2:7,893 --> 0:2:9,28
Watch out!


70
0:2:9,28 --> 0:2:13,933
Hey, crap!


71
0:2:13,933 --> 0:2:15,201
God, dang!


72
0:2:15,201 --> 0:2:16,869
Well I was at the house
and I took a shower and


73
0:2:16,869 --> 0:2:18,971
got a change of clothes, I
got to thinking about it


74
0:2:18,971 --> 0:2:21,574
and I saw my son's toys.


75
0:2:21,574 --> 0:2:22,441
Look at this thing;


76
0:2:22,441 --> 0:2:23,509
it might give us
some ideas about


77
0:2:23,509 --> 0:2:25,1
how the joints might work.


78
0:2:25,1 --> 0:2:27,88
We're gonna do something
like that with the ATV,


79
0:2:27,88 --> 0:2:29,949
so you can pretty much
wear the ATV and then when


80
0:2:29,949 --> 0:2:32,718
you're ready to go, you
can just fold it out and


81
0:2:32,718 --> 0:2:35,821
get down on it then it,
then it, then it goes.


82
0:2:35,821 --> 0:2:38,257
Our transforming ATV is
gonna need a lightweight


83
0:2:38,257 --> 0:2:41,827
metal frame that conforms
perfectly to my body.


84
0:2:41,827 --> 0:2:43,62
We'll attach 4 wheels,


85
0:2:43,62 --> 0:2:44,563
and a lightweight
engine to it.


86
0:2:44,563 --> 0:2:47,66
The rib cage has to be
especially strong because


87
0:2:47,66 --> 0:2:50,35
it'll protect my internal
organs and support all my


88
0:2:50,35 --> 0:2:52,137
weight when the frame
pulls down into a


89
0:2:52,137 --> 0:2:55,774
full-fledged ATV.


90
0:2:55,774 --> 0:2:57,977
This is gonna be a very
complicated project,


91
0:2:57,977 --> 0:2:59,445
so we're gonna
need to build


92
0:2:59,445 --> 0:3:1,847
a wooden prototype first.


93
0:3:1,847 --> 0:3:3,916
We are gonna use lawn
mower wheels on the front.


94
0:3:3,916 --> 0:3:5,618
Pete and Michael are
heading out to find two


95
0:3:5,618 --> 0:3:7,353
bicycle wheels
for the back.


96
0:3:7,353 --> 0:3:10,55
Michael: Road trip in
Uncle Mule's truck.


97
0:3:10,55 --> 0:3:12,191
Travis Taylor:
Don't wreck my truck!


98
0:3:12,191 --> 0:3:13,759
They are going
over to Rog's to


99
0:3:13,759 --> 0:3:14,793
see what he might have.


100
0:3:14,793 --> 0:3:16,862
Michael: There
is a bike, black.


101
0:3:16,862 --> 0:3:18,697
Pete: There it is.


102
0:3:18,697 --> 0:3:20,99
That would give him
some ground clearance


103
0:3:20,99 --> 0:3:21,433
on his knees.


104
0:3:21,433 --> 0:3:26,305
Let's get it and go.


105
0:3:26,305 --> 0:3:27,573
Michael: On our way
back from Rog's,


106
0:3:27,573 --> 0:3:30,9
I decided to have
a little fun.


107
0:3:30,9 --> 0:3:31,31
Somebody keeps
driving through my


108
0:3:31,31 --> 0:3:34,213
momma's yard
tearing it up.


109
0:3:34,213 --> 0:3:35,848
I know she's home
today and I was in


110
0:3:35,848 --> 0:3:38,617
uncle Travis's truck, so
I thought I'd drive his


111
0:3:38,617 --> 0:3:40,152
truck through our
yard and make it look


112
0:3:40,152 --> 0:3:41,954
like it was him driving
through the yard.


113
0:3:41,954 --> 0:3:43,222
And she'd get
mad at him and


114
0:3:43,222 --> 0:3:44,323
he wouldn't even know
what was going on.


115
0:3:44,323 --> 0:3:51,23
I thought it would be fun.


116
0:3:51,23 --> 0:3:52,865
Momma will think
its Uncle Travis


117
0:3:52,865 --> 0:4:0,906
driving through the yard.


118
0:4:0,906 --> 0:4:2,174
Travis Taylor: Well
this could pop up.


119
0:4:2,174 --> 0:4:4,41
There could be a pin
that goes in place.


120
0:4:4,41 --> 0:4:7,313
Daddy, Rog and I are
figuring out the rib cage.


121
0:4:7,313 --> 0:4:9,181
It's the single
most critical part


122
0:4:9,181 --> 0:4:10,382
of this build.


123
0:4:10,382 --> 0:4:11,95
Let's make me a
box like this,


124
0:4:11,95 --> 0:4:13,485
so cut me
whatever you said,


125
0:4:13,485 --> 0:4:18,123
Rog those pieces were
and we'll go from there.


126
0:4:18,123 --> 0:4:19,458
Daddy: I'm real
concerned about


127
0:4:19,458 --> 0:4:21,126
getting this
rib cage right.


128
0:4:21,126 --> 0:4:22,561
If it's not
designed correctly,


129
0:4:22,561 --> 0:4:24,763
Travis could be crushed.


130
0:4:24,763 --> 0:4:26,532
Travis Taylor: Needs
to be no more than,


131
0:4:26,532 --> 0:4:28,133
certainly 2 feet's enough.


132
0:4:28,133 --> 0:4:29,935
You got them two 2-foot
pieces done yet?


133
0:4:29,935 --> 0:4:31,103
Rog: I don't know
quit telling me


134
0:4:31,103 --> 0:4:32,938
to do 7 things, man.


135
0:4:32,938 --> 0:4:37,71
Travis Taylor:<i> [laughing].</i>


136
0:4:37,71 --> 0:4:41,647
Rog: I can only
think in two things.


137
0:4:41,647 --> 0:4:43,248
Travis Taylor:
That's pretty quick.


138
0:4:43,248 --> 0:4:44,383
Michael: Yeah what
else you all need,


139
0:4:44,383 --> 0:4:45,517
let's go on
another road trip.


140
0:4:45,517 --> 0:4:46,618
Pete: Yeah, it's
cool in there.


141
0:4:46,618 --> 0:4:49,21
Travis Taylor: That tire
is flat as a flute, man.


142
0:4:49,21 --> 0:4:50,923
Is that all y'all
could come up with?


143
0:4:50,923 --> 0:4:52,558
Michael: Put air in
it and it won't be.


144
0:4:52,558 --> 0:4:53,625
Pete: It's all
you ask for.


145
0:4:53,625 --> 0:4:54,993
Travis Taylor: Y'all all
went over to Rog's house


146
0:4:54,993 --> 0:4:56,161
and came back with
2 bicycles and


147
0:4:56,161 --> 0:4:57,863
I said to come back
with 2 wheels, the same,


148
0:4:57,863 --> 0:4:58,997
that aren't flat.


149
0:4:58,997 --> 0:5:0,165
Michael: How are
they different?


150
0:5:0,165 --> 0:5:2,101
Travis Taylor: Well
that's a back wheel,


151
0:5:2,101 --> 0:5:3,602
it's got a different
kind of hub,


152
0:5:3,602 --> 0:5:4,803
that's a front wheel and


153
0:5:4,803 --> 0:5:5,938
it's got a different
kind of hub.


154
0:5:5,938 --> 0:5:7,172
What do they
come back with?


155
0:5:7,172 --> 0:5:9,308
Two tires that
are different and


156
0:5:9,308 --> 0:5:15,114
one of them is flat.


157
0:5:15,114 --> 0:5:17,349
Crap we might not
have measured right.


158
0:5:17,349 --> 0:5:19,218
I wasn't thinking
about it just right.


159
0:5:19,218 --> 0:5:20,285
Pete: Open these up.


160
0:5:20,285 --> 0:5:21,62
Travis Taylor:
Take these off.


161
0:5:21,62 --> 0:5:22,855
Pete: We should
only have to open


162
0:5:22,855 --> 0:5:26,358
one of them up though.


163
0:5:26,358 --> 0:5:28,494
Travis Taylor: All right,
so here's the deal.


164
0:5:28,494 --> 0:5:30,262
I'm thinking we
might cut it here,


165
0:5:30,262 --> 0:5:33,31
put piano hinge
here, so the front,


166
0:5:33,31 --> 0:5:38,47
the front is gonna
do like this.


167
0:5:38,47 --> 0:5:40,672
Ah thank you Rog,


168
0:5:40,672 --> 0:5:43,409
there you go my brother
that's beautiful.


169
0:5:43,409 --> 0:5:45,577
Yeah aww!


170
0:5:45,577 --> 0:5:47,479
Pete: We either have
another spring here


171
0:5:47,479 --> 0:5:48,881
that's holding it to
that, against it.


172
0:5:48,881 --> 0:5:50,416
Travis Taylor: Pete
and Daddy are working


173
0:5:50,416 --> 0:5:51,817
on the front end.


174
0:5:51,817 --> 0:5:54,353
When I'm in ATV mode my
hands will be holding


175
0:5:54,353 --> 0:5:56,822
onto the front axle
and I'll steer by


176
0:5:56,822 --> 0:5:58,891
turning the front wheels.


177
0:5:58,891 --> 0:6:1,66
The big problem is where
to put the back wheels so


178
0:6:1,66 --> 0:6:3,629
they can be deployed
when I want,


179
0:6:3,629 --> 0:6:5,564
but don't get in
the way of walking.


180
0:6:5,564 --> 0:6:7,466
First up, I'm
gonna assign Pete


181
0:6:7,466 --> 0:6:12,905
to work on the front wheels.


182
0:6:12,905 --> 0:6:14,54
Pete: My job is to
figure out how to roll


183
0:6:14,54 --> 0:6:17,109
and steer the transformer.


184
0:6:17,109 --> 0:6:21,68
We're gonna start by using
the lawn mower wheels.


185
0:6:21,68 --> 0:6:23,382
Two forks that are
coming off the


186
0:6:23,382 --> 0:6:24,85
outside of his arms.


187
0:6:24,85 --> 0:6:25,984
Just have to
figure out which


188
0:6:25,984 --> 0:6:32,157
way you want the
forks to pivot.


189
0:6:32,157 --> 0:6:34,693
Daddy: How much
does he need to turn?


190
0:6:34,693 --> 0:6:39,31
I can lop that corner off
right there pretty quick.


191
0:6:39,31 --> 0:6:41,133
There's no room for
the wheels to turn,


192
0:6:41,133 --> 0:6:45,838
so I had to cut off the
corners of the frame.


193
0:6:45,838 --> 0:6:51,343
Now it should
turn on a dime.


194
0:6:51,343 --> 0:6:53,111
Travis Taylor: I've been
wrestling with the idea


195
0:6:53,111 --> 0:6:54,947
about where these rear
wheels are gonna go when


196
0:6:54,947 --> 0:6:59,818
I'm standing up and
suddenly, it hit me.


197
0:6:59,818 --> 0:7:2,187
I got an idea about this.


198
0:7:2,187 --> 0:7:5,57
This piece pins to that
piece and the wheel is


199
0:7:5,57 --> 0:7:8,327
gonna be right
here at this pin.


200
0:7:8,327 --> 0:7:9,628
So I got knee joints and


201
0:7:9,628 --> 0:7:10,963
I got everything
else, right.


202
0:7:10,963 --> 0:7:12,13
Then when I get
ready to go,


203
0:7:12,13 --> 0:7:15,3
then I just lean
over on the wheel.


204
0:7:15,3 --> 0:7:16,735
Michael: Just as Uncle
Travis was figuring out


205
0:7:16,735 --> 0:7:19,905
how to attach the
wheels, my phone rings.


206
0:7:19,905 --> 0:7:21,974
There she is, she's
calling me now.


207
0:7:21,974 --> 0:7:23,8
And it's my momma.


208
0:7:23,8 --> 0:7:24,943
This is gonna be good.


209
0:7:24,943 --> 0:7:26,111
Hello.


210
0:7:26,111 --> 0:7:27,846
Momma: Why the hell did
you drive through my yard?


211
0:7:27,846 --> 0:7:29,481
Michael: Well it
wasn't me drivin'.


212
0:7:29,481 --> 0:7:31,383
Well you saw what
truck it was.


213
0:7:31,383 --> 0:7:33,852
Travis Taylor: He's trying
to blame me for it PK.


214
0:7:33,852 --> 0:7:37,189
Momma: Yeah it was a red
truck with you driving


215
0:7:37,189 --> 0:7:39,725
and Pete in the
passenger's seat.


216
0:7:39,725 --> 0:7:40,993
Michael: All right Momma.


217
0:7:40,993 --> 0:7:42,6
Rog: You got busted!


218
0:7:42,6 --> 0:7:43,61
Michael: We'll talk later.


219
0:7:43,61 --> 0:7:44,129
Rog: He is gonna
get a whoopin' as


220
0:7:44,129 --> 0:7:45,3
soon as he gets home.


221
0:7:45,3 --> 0:7:46,131
<i> [laughing].</i>


222
0:7:46,131 --> 0:7:47,65
I love it!


223
0:7:47,65 --> 0:7:48,367
Momma: I don't want
my yard destroyed


224
0:7:48,367 --> 0:7:50,102
like Grandma Mary's.


225
0:7:50,102 --> 0:7:52,7
Rog: Oh she's low rated.


226
0:7:52,7 --> 0:7:53,472
Michael: Yeah.


227
0:7:53,472 --> 0:7:54,873
Travis Taylor: Michael
was trying to get me in


228
0:7:54,873 --> 0:7:57,376
trouble by driving
my truck through his


229
0:7:57,376 --> 0:8:0,345
momma's backyard,
but it completely


230
0:8:0,345 --> 0:8:1,947
backfired on him.


231
0:8:1,947 --> 0:8:4,616
He's so nervous, he's
upset he's not gonna go


232
0:8:4,616 --> 0:8:6,752
home for 2 or 3 days.


233
0:8:6,752 --> 0:8:9,254
'Cause he don't want his
momma to yell at him.


234
0:8:9,254 --> 0:8:12,457
'Cause it's the funniest
thing I've ever seen.


235
0:8:12,457 --> 0:8:13,559
We're having a blast;


236
0:8:13,559 --> 0:8:14,86
he's not gonna
live this down as


237
0:8:14,86 --> 0:8:16,295
long as we can make it.


238
0:8:16,295 --> 0:8:18,463
I recommend you go
spend the night down


239
0:8:18,463 --> 0:8:20,132
at ACE tonight Michael.


240
0:8:20,132 --> 0:8:21,199
Michael: Yeah.


241
0:8:21,199 --> 0:8:22,434
Travis Taylor: I
don't believe I would


242
0:8:22,434 --> 0:8:23,535
go home for a day
or two if I was you.


243
0:8:23,535 --> 0:8:24,603
Pete: Yeah.


244
0:8:24,603 --> 0:8:26,204
Travis Taylor:
Since Michael and


245
0:8:26,204 --> 0:8:27,94
Pete brought me back
two different wheels,


246
0:8:27,94 --> 0:8:30,275
one of which was flat,
we're gonna call an


247
0:8:30,275 --> 0:8:33,312
audible and make the rear
wheels out of plywood.


248
0:8:33,312 --> 0:8:36,381
We're going to have
some bungees that helped.


249
0:8:36,381 --> 0:8:38,65
Put it on.


250
0:8:38,65 --> 0:8:39,851
We're getting
really close to doing a


251
0:8:39,851 --> 0:8:42,387
prototype test with
the suit, the ATV,


252
0:8:42,387 --> 0:8:44,289
except we won't
have any motors on it,


253
0:8:44,289 --> 0:8:45,39
kinda like a wagon.


254
0:8:45,39 --> 0:8:46,558
Hopefully the guys
will push me around.


255
0:8:46,558 --> 0:8:47,826
We'll see if the
steering works,


256
0:8:47,826 --> 0:8:48,894
we'll see if the
wheels works,


257
0:8:48,894 --> 0:8:50,729
we'll see if it can
transform from standing up


258
0:8:50,729 --> 0:8:52,164
and walking around
and going down in


259
0:8:52,164 --> 0:8:53,765
the ATV position.


260
0:8:53,765 --> 0:8:55,133
If this prototype works,


261
0:8:55,133 --> 0:8:56,268
we're gonna move on and


262
0:8:56,268 --> 0:8:57,736
make the real
one out of metal.


263
0:8:57,736 --> 0:9:0,72
If it doesn't, I might be
spending a lot of time


264
0:9:0,72 --> 0:9:2,841
with the chiropractor.


265
0:9:2,841 --> 0:9:4,643
This is heavy, man.


266
0:9:4,643 --> 0:9:6,78
Michael: If you can't
handle it, let it go.


267
0:9:6,78 --> 0:9:7,679
Travis Taylor: Watch
out, can I let it go?


268
0:9:7,679 --> 0:9:8,547
Michael: Yes, yes.


269
0:9:8,547 --> 0:9:9,648
Travis Taylor:
That's all right.


270
0:9:9,648 --> 0:9:10,816
Pete: His wheels are
almost straight.


271
0:9:10,816 --> 0:9:11,95
Travis Taylor: All right
now let's see if I can


272
0:9:11,95 --> 0:9:13,452
transform and get
down and make it roll.


273
0:9:13,452 --> 0:9:14,653
All right there.


274
0:9:14,653 --> 0:9:16,555
Michael: There's one leg.


275
0:9:16,555 --> 0:9:18,323
Oh you're hung
on your own leg.


276
0:9:18,323 --> 0:9:20,25
Travis Taylor:
Something broke loose.


277
0:9:20,25 --> 0:9:20,959
Michael: All right.


278
0:9:20,959 --> 0:9:22,761
Travis Taylor:
Something broke loose.


279
0:9:22,761 --> 0:9:24,763
Pete: Probably
just the Velcro.


280
0:9:24,763 --> 0:9:26,965
Travis Taylor: Oh crap
something's loose,


281
0:9:26,965 --> 0:9:28,667
it broke loose.


282
0:9:28,667 --> 0:9:29,935
What broke loose?


283
0:9:29,935 --> 0:9:31,336
Michael: You got to
drag your knees up.


284
0:9:31,336 --> 0:9:33,238
Travis Taylor:
Why am I stuck?


285
0:9:33,238 --> 0:9:34,706
Rog:<i> [laughing].</i>


286
0:9:34,706 --> 0:9:37,309
Travis Taylor:
I can't get up.


287
0:9:37,309 --> 0:9:38,71
Pete: Is that bungee?


288
0:9:38,71 --> 0:9:39,778
Travis Taylor: No
ain't the bungee.


289
0:9:39,778 --> 0:9:40,779
I can't get up.


290
0:9:40,779 --> 0:9:42,481
Rog: Seeing Travis
in this prototype was


291
0:9:42,481 --> 0:9:44,149
the funniest
thing I ever saw.


292
0:9:44,149 --> 0:9:45,45
He looked like
he was stuck in a


293
0:9:45,45 --> 0:9:46,985
fold out couch
or something.


294
0:9:46,985 --> 0:9:47,886
Travis Taylor: Ough!


295
0:9:47,886 --> 0:9:49,221
Rog: Stay with it, Mule.


296
0:9:49,221 --> 0:9:50,856
Travis Taylor: I
can't get up, man.


297
0:9:50,856 --> 0:9:52,157
<i> [laughing].</i>


298
0:9:52,157 --> 0:9:54,993
Listen, listen,
oh watch out, Rog.


299
0:9:54,993 --> 0:9:55,894
Hey, look.


300
0:9:55,894 --> 0:9:57,262
Rog: Let me push, push ya.


301
0:9:57,262 --> 0:9:58,397
Travis Taylor: Stop.


302
0:9:58,397 --> 0:9:59,331
Oh crap.


303
0:9:59,331 --> 0:10:0,265
Daddy: That ain't
gonna get it.


304
0:10:0,265 --> 0:10:1,266
Travis Taylor: No,
this ain't right,


305
0:10:1,266 --> 0:10:3,235
something ain't
right here boys.


306
0:10:3,235 --> 0:10:7,105
I've transformed
and I can't get up.


307
0:10:7,105 --> 0:10:9,274
Oh crap.


308
0:10:9,274 --> 0:10:13,912
Ow!


309
0:10:13,912 --> 0:10:15,981
Daddy: These experiments
are dangerous.


310
0:10:15,981 --> 0:10:17,716
Don't try them at home.


311
0:10:17,716 --> 0:10:19,818
In fact, I wish these
guys wouldn't try em


312
0:10:19,818 --> 0:10:22,454
at my home!


313
0:10:22,454 --> 0:10:25,791
Travis Taylor:
Why am I stuck?


314
0:10:25,791 --> 0:10:27,25
Rog: Stay with it, Mule.


315
0:10:27,25 --> 0:10:29,94
Travis Taylor: We're
building a wearable ATV


316
0:10:29,94 --> 0:10:31,96
that can drive
over any terrain,


317
0:10:31,96 --> 0:10:35,1
then transform into a
suit for walking around.


318
0:10:35,1 --> 0:10:37,35
But our prototype
has a huge problem.


319
0:10:37,35 --> 0:10:40,205
In ATV mode the frame
collapsed putting


320
0:10:40,205 --> 0:10:43,141
all the weight
directly on my spine.


321
0:10:43,141 --> 0:10:47,813
I can't, it won't undo,
it's stuck wherever it is.


322
0:10:47,813 --> 0:10:49,848
Daddy: It's a good thing
we made this out of wood


323
0:10:49,848 --> 0:10:52,451
first because if it was
made out of metal we could


324
0:10:52,451 --> 0:10:54,352
have broken his back.


325
0:10:54,352 --> 0:10:56,388
Travis Taylor: Something's
loose, it broke loose.


326
0:10:56,388 --> 0:10:59,257
I could feel the pressure,
but I couldn't stop it.


327
0:10:59,257 --> 0:11:0,125
Michael: C'mon up.


328
0:11:0,125 --> 0:11:1,193
Daddy: Can you
come out of there?


329
0:11:1,193 --> 0:11:3,862
Travis Taylor: Yeah,
I can get out of this.


330
0:11:3,862 --> 0:11:6,298
See look in order for it
to roll right, now look,


331
0:11:6,298 --> 0:11:9,234
if you did this,
look, it will roll,


332
0:11:9,234 --> 0:11:10,869
look that right
there will roll.


333
0:11:10,869 --> 0:11:11,937
Michael: Yeah.


334
0:11:11,937 --> 0:11:12,971
Travis Taylor: That's
what we gotta to have


335
0:11:12,971 --> 0:11:14,39
it locked together,
right there.


336
0:11:14,39 --> 0:11:15,24
The front worked fine.


337
0:11:15,24 --> 0:11:16,274
Rog: Yup.


338
0:11:16,274 --> 0:11:17,843
Travis Taylor: This
part's fine, worked good.


339
0:11:17,843 --> 0:11:19,111
I can even lean out
and it will fall out


340
0:11:19,111 --> 0:11:20,846
in front of me
that's a good idea.


341
0:11:20,846 --> 0:11:22,914
This right here concerns
me 'cause that puts all


342
0:11:22,914 --> 0:11:27,385
the weight of the vehicle
right in my back.


343
0:11:27,385 --> 0:11:30,922
To get my body in the
right position in ATV mode


344
0:11:30,922 --> 0:11:33,625
we need to keep the
frame from falling flat,


345
0:11:33,625 --> 0:11:35,861
so we're gonna need to
add a locking mechanism


346
0:11:35,861 --> 0:11:38,463
in my hips to keep
the frame stable and


347
0:11:38,463 --> 0:11:42,768
prevent it from
breaking my back.


348
0:11:42,768 --> 0:11:44,803
Pete: We have a plan for
the frame but we also need


349
0:11:44,803 --> 0:11:47,606
to figure out how we're
gonna power this thing.


350
0:11:47,606 --> 0:11:49,441
Travis Taylor: 200cc
gas powered engine.


351
0:11:49,441 --> 0:11:50,642
Daddy: No, no.


352
0:11:50,642 --> 0:11:51,777
Travis Taylor: Or an
electrical motor or


353
0:11:51,777 --> 0:11:52,611
whatever.


354
0:11:52,611 --> 0:11:53,712
Daddy: Forget gas engine.


355
0:11:53,712 --> 0:11:55,13
Now you, I'm not gonna
put up with you putting


356
0:11:55,13 --> 0:11:56,314
a gas engine on the back.


357
0:11:56,314 --> 0:11:57,449
Travis Taylor: Well
I don't even where


358
0:11:57,449 --> 0:11:58,416
we'd put it Daddy.


359
0:11:58,416 --> 0:11:59,818
If we put it here a
gas engine weighs


360
0:11:59,818 --> 0:12:1,86
what a 150 pounds?


361
0:12:1,86 --> 0:12:3,355
How much does a
5-horse engine weigh?


362
0:12:3,355 --> 0:12:5,39
Daddy: There's no way
I am letting him drive


363
0:12:5,39 --> 0:12:7,526
around the road with a
tank of highly flammable


364
0:12:7,526 --> 0:12:9,661
liquid strapped
to his behind.


365
0:12:9,661 --> 0:12:12,297
I don't want gas
on your back.


366
0:12:12,297 --> 0:12:13,698
Travis Taylor: I don't
want gas on my back


367
0:12:13,698 --> 0:12:15,66
either, Daddy.


368
0:12:15,66 --> 0:12:16,101
Daddy: Take that
out of the loop.


369
0:12:16,101 --> 0:12:17,302
Travis Taylor: Well then
if we are gonna do that,


370
0:12:17,302 --> 0:12:18,37
then it means that
it's electrical,


371
0:12:18,37 --> 0:12:19,671
that means we got to
find electrical motors


372
0:12:19,671 --> 0:12:20,705
that will do it.


373
0:12:20,705 --> 0:12:21,807
Michael: We got to go
get some materials.


374
0:12:21,807 --> 0:12:24,142
Travis Taylor: Let's
see what we're doing.


375
0:12:24,142 --> 0:12:26,244
We need
parts of ATV's.


376
0:12:26,244 --> 0:12:27,312
Michael: Right.


377
0:12:27,312 --> 0:12:28,38
Travis Taylor: That we
can start working on.


378
0:12:28,38 --> 0:12:29,748
Why don't you and Rog
go find us some parts,


379
0:12:29,748 --> 0:12:30,816
me and Daddy will start
digging into this and


380
0:12:30,816 --> 0:12:32,417
figure out what we
did wrong so by the


381
0:12:32,417 --> 0:12:33,618
time you get back.


382
0:12:33,618 --> 0:12:34,853
Rog: Road trip.


383
0:12:34,853 --> 0:12:35,654
Michael: Road trip.


384
0:12:35,654 --> 0:12:36,588
Pete: Oh c'mon guys.


385
0:12:36,588 --> 0:12:37,689
Michael: Road trip.


386
0:12:37,689 --> 0:12:38,99
Travis Taylor: Hey, y'all
don't stay gone long.


387
0:12:38,99 --> 0:12:40,158
Michael: You say
that every time we


388
0:12:40,158 --> 0:12:41,126
go on a road trip.


389
0:12:41,126 --> 0:12:42,327
Rog: We ain't
never gone long.


390
0:12:42,327 --> 0:12:43,495
Travis Taylor: Yeah,
because you always


391
0:12:43,495 --> 0:12:44,462
stay gone too long.


392
0:12:44,462 --> 0:12:45,33
Rog: Whatever.


393
0:12:45,33 --> 0:12:46,364
Pete: He means it
every time too.


394
0:12:46,364 --> 0:12:47,499
Rog: Shot gun.


395
0:12:47,499 --> 0:12:49,0
Travis Taylor: So
I sent Michael and


396
0:12:49,0 --> 0:12:51,203
Rog out to look for some
small electrical motors.


397
0:12:51,203 --> 0:12:52,47
Rog: We got motor
city right there.


398
0:12:52,47 --> 0:12:53,338
Right there.


399
0:12:53,338 --> 0:12:54,339
Michael: Where, what?


400
0:12:54,339 --> 0:12:56,241
Rog: That little blue
motor city thing.


401
0:12:56,241 --> 0:12:56,975
Michael: You're right.


402
0:12:56,975 --> 0:12:58,777
Rog: Pull in there.


403
0:12:58,777 --> 0:13:0,579
We headed over to this
street that has all these


404
0:13:0,579 --> 0:13:2,881
little junk shops
and antique stores.


405
0:13:2,881 --> 0:13:4,983
I figured that's where
we'd find a good used


406
0:13:4,983 --> 0:13:6,952
electric motor.


407
0:13:6,952 --> 0:13:9,354
Michael: Let's see
if you was right.


408
0:13:9,354 --> 0:13:11,223
It may not be
worth a damn, Rog.


409
0:13:11,223 --> 0:13:12,958
Rog: So number 2.


410
0:13:12,958 --> 0:13:14,92
Michael: What?


411
0:13:14,92 --> 0:13:17,829
Turn it on,
see if it works.


412
0:13:17,829 --> 0:13:18,897
Michael: Things
got a lot of power;


413
0:13:18,897 --> 0:13:22,834
it will carry you
around won't it?


414
0:13:22,834 --> 0:13:24,569
We found this
nifty motorcycle,


415
0:13:24,569 --> 0:13:27,439
so we're gonna take the
motor from that but I


416
0:13:27,439 --> 0:13:30,742
think we're gonna need
a little more power.


417
0:13:30,742 --> 0:13:32,377
We checked out
that motorcycle.


418
0:13:32,377 --> 0:13:33,478
Clerk: That's a
good one there.


419
0:13:33,478 --> 0:13:34,412
Michael: It runs
pretty good,


420
0:13:34,412 --> 0:13:35,614
you got anymore
like that thing.


421
0:13:35,614 --> 0:13:36,715
Clerk: Yeah.


422
0:13:36,715 --> 0:13:38,516
I got a 4 wheeler
right there.


423
0:13:38,516 --> 0:13:39,484
Rog: Where?


424
0:13:39,484 --> 0:13:44,89
Michael: Check that
4 wheeler out Rog.


425
0:13:44,89 --> 0:13:46,992
This toy ATV has a
working electrical motor


426
0:13:46,992 --> 0:13:48,293
that we could tear out.


427
0:13:48,293 --> 0:13:49,661
And if we put together
with that little


428
0:13:49,661 --> 0:13:51,363
motorcycle engine,
we'll actually have the


429
0:13:51,363 --> 0:13:55,367
equivalent of
a gas engine.


430
0:13:55,367 --> 0:14:4,442
Man, that looks good.


431
0:14:4,442 --> 0:14:5,71
Travis Taylor: I'm done.


432
0:14:5,71 --> 0:14:7,545
While Rog and
Michael were gone,


433
0:14:7,545 --> 0:14:10,81
we built a new locking
metal hinge and


434
0:14:10,81 --> 0:14:11,783
installed it on
the prototype.


435
0:14:11,783 --> 0:14:13,518
This is to just
make sure that this


436
0:14:13,518 --> 0:14:15,754
is the right idea.


437
0:14:15,754 --> 0:14:17,289
Ok well, y'all push me.


438
0:14:17,289 --> 0:14:19,157
Well, it's rolling fine.


439
0:14:19,157 --> 0:14:21,526
It does all right,
this is the right plan.


440
0:14:21,526 --> 0:14:22,861
Daddy: Get out and
let's start making on


441
0:14:22,861 --> 0:14:23,895
a good one.


442
0:14:23,895 --> 0:14:24,963
Travis Taylor: Yeah
we need to figure out


443
0:14:24,963 --> 0:14:26,64
how to make this
out of aluminum


444
0:14:26,64 --> 0:14:27,299
or somethin' now.


445
0:14:27,299 --> 0:14:28,433
<i> [Car horn].</i>


446
0:14:28,433 --> 0:14:29,601
Travis Taylor:
There they are.


447
0:14:29,601 --> 0:14:31,269
About time they got back.


448
0:14:31,269 --> 0:14:34,306
We got the idea this
works just fine.


449
0:14:34,306 --> 0:14:35,74
Look at that,
those are nice,


450
0:14:35,74 --> 0:14:37,475
we use all that
for something.


451
0:14:37,475 --> 0:14:39,21
Michael: We had
to make two stops.


452
0:14:39,21 --> 0:14:40,245
Pete: There's
some good shocks.


453
0:14:40,245 --> 0:14:41,279
Travis Taylor: That's
it, look that has got


454
0:14:41,279 --> 0:14:42,38
electrical motors in
it, we can use them.


455
0:14:42,38 --> 0:14:43,348
Michael: Right there
is the batteries


456
0:14:43,348 --> 0:14:44,382
for it under there.


457
0:14:44,382 --> 0:14:45,45
Travis Taylor: Let's
start getting it out,


458
0:14:45,45 --> 0:14:46,484
let's find us some
aluminum pieces,


459
0:14:46,484 --> 0:14:47,986
turn that prototype
into a real transformer.


460
0:14:47,986 --> 0:14:49,854
Rog and Daddy can start
measuring the pieces


461
0:14:49,854 --> 0:14:51,256
and figuring out
how to convert this


462
0:14:51,256 --> 0:14:52,857
over to the aluminum.


463
0:14:52,857 --> 0:14:55,393
Pete, why don't
you tear into them


464
0:14:55,393 --> 0:14:57,562
motorcycles that
they just bought?


465
0:14:57,562 --> 0:14:58,53
Pete: Ok.


466
0:14:58,53 --> 0:15:0,131
Travis Taylor: And
find the motors and


467
0:15:0,131 --> 0:15:2,667
electronics and all that.


468
0:15:2,667 --> 0:15:4,235
Michael: Here's
the instructions.


469
0:15:4,235 --> 0:15:6,37
If you feel like reading
instructions.


470
0:15:6,37 --> 0:15:7,405
Daddy: I don't know
what you need to read the


471
0:15:7,405 --> 0:15:8,807
instructions, we're
gonna tear the thing


472
0:15:8,807 --> 0:15:10,175
apart not put it together.


473
0:15:10,175 --> 0:15:16,381
Rog: Does it have
instructions to tear it apart?


474
0:15:16,381 --> 0:15:17,716
Travis Taylor: We're
gonna build the frame


475
0:15:17,716 --> 0:15:18,75
out of aluminum,


476
0:15:18,75 --> 0:15:20,952
skin it with armor and
when we get it done,


477
0:15:20,952 --> 0:15:23,321
we're gonna put this
transforming ATV to the


478
0:15:23,321 --> 0:15:25,29
ultimate redneck test.


479
0:15:25,29 --> 0:15:26,191
A beer run.


480
0:15:26,191 --> 0:15:27,959
Rog, you help Daddy
figure out how to


481
0:15:27,959 --> 0:15:29,327
reproduce this
with aluminum.


482
0:15:29,327 --> 0:15:30,829
Cut the pieces and
get them to Michael


483
0:15:30,829 --> 0:15:32,163
as fast as you can.


484
0:15:32,163 --> 0:15:38,937
Michael, you weld them
as fast as you can.


485
0:15:38,937 --> 0:15:41,6
Daddy: All right,
there's one of them.


486
0:15:41,6 --> 0:15:42,741
Michael: Here is your
leg part finished.


487
0:15:42,741 --> 0:15:44,843
Travis Taylor: Oh
man, look at that.


488
0:15:44,843 --> 0:15:46,244
Michael: Oughtta
wait with the.


489
0:15:46,244 --> 0:15:47,145
Travis Taylor:
Is it still hot?


490
0:15:47,145 --> 0:15:48,246
Michael: No, it
ain't hot no more.


491
0:15:48,246 --> 0:15:49,214
Travis Taylor: So that's
that piece right there.


492
0:15:49,214 --> 0:15:50,382
Michael: Yeah, drilled
all the way up to


493
0:15:50,382 --> 0:15:51,783
mount to the
hip somewhere.


494
0:15:51,783 --> 0:15:57,255
Travis Taylor: All right,
go make the other one.


495
0:15:57,255 --> 0:15:58,456
Daddy: All we need
you to do is line


496
0:15:58,456 --> 0:16:0,558
the washers up
with that hole.


497
0:16:0,558 --> 0:16:2,36
While those boys were
mounting the new set of


498
0:16:2,36 --> 0:16:4,763
bike wheels, Pete and I
were attaching the motors


499
0:16:4,763 --> 0:16:7,198
and the batteries from
those toy vehicles.


500
0:16:7,198 --> 0:16:11,102
Pete: I think it's
pretty well lined up.


501
0:16:11,102 --> 0:16:12,604
Daddy: Uh-oh.


502
0:16:12,604 --> 0:16:14,773
Pete: Pull that
out and we'll see.


503
0:16:14,773 --> 0:16:16,408
Travis Taylor: It
ain't going nowhere.


504
0:16:16,408 --> 0:16:17,475
All right.


505
0:16:17,475 --> 0:16:19,144
It took us a while to
finally attach the motors


506
0:16:19,144 --> 0:16:25,5
to the frame, but I think
we got that working.


507
0:16:25,5 --> 0:16:26,84
Hey, hey, hey!


508
0:16:26,84 --> 0:16:27,852
Hold on just a minute.


509
0:16:27,852 --> 0:16:30,188
I told Michael to get
working on the chest plate.


510
0:16:30,188 --> 0:16:34,92
When I turn around, I see
a disaster in the making.


511
0:16:34,92 --> 0:16:36,828
What in the crap
are y'all doing?


512
0:16:36,828 --> 0:16:38,329
Michael's doing
one of the worst


513
0:16:38,329 --> 0:16:40,698
welding jobs I
have ever seen him do.


514
0:16:40,698 --> 0:16:42,667
This is the rib cage
that's gonna protect


515
0:16:42,667 --> 0:16:44,936
my chest and he has
got angels going


516
0:16:44,936 --> 0:16:46,671
every which way.


517
0:16:46,671 --> 0:16:48,84
Look how cock
eyed that is, now.


518
0:16:48,84 --> 0:16:49,774
Rog: Who did that?


519
0:16:49,774 --> 0:16:51,142
Who did that?


520
0:16:51,142 --> 0:16:52,31
Travis Taylor:
What in the world?


521
0:16:52,31 --> 0:16:54,579
Michael: First
Uncle Travis says,


522
0:16:54,579 --> 0:16:55,947
"Do it as fast
as you can."


523
0:16:55,947 --> 0:16:57,148
Then, when I do
it fast, he says,


524
0:16:57,148 --> 0:16:58,65
"That's not good
enough, do it over."


525
0:16:58,65 --> 0:17:0,185
There's no
pleasing this guy.


526
0:17:0,185 --> 0:17:1,653
Travis Taylor: You
got, that means you


527
0:17:1,653 --> 0:17:3,88
are gonna have to
completely redo it,


528
0:17:3,88 --> 0:17:4,622
you got to grind
them off and


529
0:17:4,622 --> 0:17:8,493
put them up here
and re-weld it.


530
0:17:8,493 --> 0:17:10,328
Michael's welding
job actually puts


531
0:17:10,328 --> 0:17:11,696
my life in danger.


532
0:17:11,696 --> 0:17:14,199
I already nearly got
my back broke and


533
0:17:14,199 --> 0:17:17,35
now I could get
my chest crushed too.


534
0:17:17,35 --> 0:17:19,904
And Michael and Rog think
it's all fun and games.


535
0:17:19,904 --> 0:17:21,773
Rog: I'm glad I ain't
the one who done that.


536
0:17:21,773 --> 0:17:22,74
Travis Taylor: Man.


537
0:17:22,74 --> 0:17:23,942
Michael: Who
designed that thing?


538
0:17:23,942 --> 0:17:24,943
Travis Taylor:
I designed it,


539
0:17:24,943 --> 0:17:26,44
but you didn't weld
it for nothing.


540
0:17:26,44 --> 0:17:27,345
Michael: Who
designed that thing?


541
0:17:27,345 --> 0:17:29,47
Daddy: That beats
anything I've ever seen.


542
0:17:29,47 --> 0:17:30,515
Those boys fight so much;


543
0:17:30,515 --> 0:17:32,617
sometimes I think
Michael intentionally


544
0:17:32,617 --> 0:17:34,152
messes things up.


545
0:17:34,152 --> 0:17:35,22
Travis Taylor: You're
gonna break that.


546
0:17:35,22 --> 0:17:36,121
Michael: No I ain't.


547
0:17:36,121 --> 0:17:37,222
I didn't do nothing.


548
0:17:37,222 --> 0:17:38,857
Daddy: Travis
gets really mad,


549
0:17:38,857 --> 0:17:40,358
but that just seems
to tickle Michael.


550
0:17:40,358 --> 0:17:41,626
The madder Travis gets,


551
0:17:41,626 --> 0:17:43,461
the more Michael
seems to enjoy it.


552
0:17:43,461 --> 0:17:44,729
Travis Taylor: I can't
believe you did that.


553
0:17:44,729 --> 0:17:54,372
I just, God that
aggravates me.


554
0:17:54,372 --> 0:17:56,207
Pete: All right, let me
mark these real quick.


555
0:17:56,207 --> 0:17:57,609
Travis Taylor: We're
building a wearable


556
0:17:57,609 --> 0:18:0,545
transforming ATV
that will fold into a


557
0:18:0,545 --> 0:18:3,982
full size all
terrain vehicle.


558
0:18:3,982 --> 0:18:5,583
But Michael's lazy
welding makes my


559
0:18:5,583 --> 0:18:8,553
chest plate vulnerable
and dangerous.


560
0:18:8,553 --> 0:18:10,121
Hey, hey, hey!


561
0:18:10,121 --> 0:18:11,956
Look how cock
eyed that is, now.


562
0:18:11,956 --> 0:18:12,891
Michael: Who
designed that thing?


563
0:18:12,891 --> 0:18:13,858
Travis Taylor:
I designed it,


564
0:18:13,858 --> 0:18:14,959
but you didn't weld
it for nothin'.


565
0:18:14,959 --> 0:18:17,529
Michael: Who
designed that thing?


566
0:18:17,529 --> 0:18:18,83
Travis Taylor: With
a little persuasion


567
0:18:18,83 --> 0:18:20,665
Michael did finally
get it right.


568
0:18:20,665 --> 0:18:23,301
And we're back on track.


569
0:18:23,301 --> 0:18:24,903
Michael: There it is.


570
0:18:24,903 --> 0:18:25,904
Travis Taylor: All
right, look here,


571
0:18:25,904 --> 0:18:27,472
we got the chest
plate about done.


572
0:18:27,472 --> 0:18:31,509
So the skin is gonna have
to cover the inside.


573
0:18:31,509 --> 0:18:33,678
All right, I got this
piece up here we're missing.


574
0:18:33,678 --> 0:18:35,413
Next we had
to work on the brakes.


575
0:18:35,413 --> 0:18:36,881
Yeah get in there.


576
0:18:36,881 --> 0:18:38,183
Michael: Put the
round thing in first.


577
0:18:38,183 --> 0:18:39,651
Travis Taylor: Yeah, yeah
I've done this before on


578
0:18:39,651 --> 0:18:42,387
my bicycle before I know
what's happening here.


579
0:18:42,387 --> 0:18:43,855
Michael: All right
now hit the brake,


580
0:18:43,855 --> 0:18:44,956
hit the brake.


581
0:18:44,956 --> 0:18:45,99
There it is.


582
0:18:45,99 --> 0:18:47,158
Travis Taylor: Did
it let off though?


583
0:18:47,158 --> 0:18:48,226
Michael: Yup.


584
0:18:48,226 --> 0:18:49,327
Travis Taylor: Now
it's the last step,


585
0:18:49,327 --> 0:18:51,29
skinning the
ATV suit with an


586
0:18:51,29 --> 0:18:56,34
exoskeleton and mudguards.


587
0:18:56,34 --> 0:18:57,669
Rog: We took a bunch of
plastic pieces from the


588
0:18:57,669 --> 0:19:0,438
toy ATV and cut them up
so the transformer really


589
0:19:0,438 --> 0:19:4,142
looks cool as it's
rolling down the road.


590
0:19:4,142 --> 0:19:9,881
Travis Taylor: What do
you think about that?


591
0:19:9,881 --> 0:19:12,5
Now it's time to do
our first road test.


592
0:19:12,5 --> 0:19:14,586
I'm nervous because I
might get stuck in it


593
0:19:14,586 --> 0:19:17,255
again or, it could just
collapse at high speed or,


594
0:19:17,255 --> 0:19:23,861
who knows, I might
just run over myself.


595
0:19:23,861 --> 0:19:26,97
Here we go,
you ready?


596
0:19:26,97 --> 0:19:28,8
Michael: Yeah hit it, go.


597
0:19:28,8 --> 0:19:33,404
Daddy: Look at him go!


598
0:19:33,404 --> 0:19:37,75
He left here like
Lindburg didn't he?


599
0:19:37,75 --> 0:19:38,476
Travis Taylor: It
was pretty amazing.


600
0:19:38,476 --> 0:19:41,412
I started out slow, but I
soon started picking up


601
0:19:41,412 --> 0:19:43,715
speed and it was
smooth as silk,


602
0:19:43,715 --> 0:19:47,85
this transforming
ATV really is more


603
0:19:47,85 --> 0:19:48,419
than meets the eye.


604
0:19:48,419 --> 0:19:49,954
Michael: You best stay
out of the monkey grass,


605
0:19:49,954 --> 0:19:52,223
before you get
grandma all fired up.


606
0:19:52,223 --> 0:19:54,559
<i> [laughing].</i>


607
0:19:54,559 --> 0:19:57,195
Michael: It works.


608
0:19:57,195 --> 0:19:59,897
Daddy: Watch out.


609
0:19:59,897 --> 0:20:0,965
Michael: Can you get up?


610
0:20:0,965 --> 0:20:2,533
Travis Taylor: Well,
I should be able to.


611
0:20:2,533 --> 0:20:4,335
Rog: I don't know
about all that.


612
0:20:4,335 --> 0:20:6,337
Travis Taylor: This is
the moment of truth,


613
0:20:6,337 --> 0:20:9,54
this has proven we can
make a wearable ATV,


614
0:20:9,54 --> 0:20:12,677
but have we really built
a transforming ATV?


615
0:20:12,677 --> 0:20:15,88
Right there is locked,
it won't come in.


616
0:20:15,88 --> 0:20:23,321
Can I even stand
up in this thing?


617
0:20:23,321 --> 0:20:28,159
Michael: There you go,
there is one foot.


618
0:20:28,159 --> 0:20:30,695
Rog: Look at
him, look at him.


619
0:20:30,695 --> 0:20:32,53
Travis Taylor: Boom,
transforming taters


620
0:20:32,53 --> 0:20:33,731
right there.


621
0:20:33,731 --> 0:20:42,24
Now I can
walk around in it.


622
0:20:42,24 --> 0:20:44,75
Whoo, how about that?


623
0:20:44,75 --> 0:20:45,209
Michael: That's
impressive.


624
0:20:45,209 --> 0:20:46,477
Travis Taylor: Now
it's time to put our


625
0:20:46,477 --> 0:20:48,212
transforming ATV
to the ultimate


626
0:20:48,212 --> 0:20:51,249
redneck challenge,
a beer run!


627
0:20:51,249 --> 0:20:52,35
Ho-yah!


628
0:20:52,35 --> 0:20:54,319
Rog: Settle down, Mule.


629
0:20:54,319 --> 0:20:56,754
Travis Taylor: Michael
go get the wagon.


630
0:20:56,754 --> 0:20:58,723
Hook it up
to this thing,


631
0:20:58,723 --> 0:21:0,91
we gonna
celebrate tonight.


632
0:21:0,91 --> 0:21:1,392
Rog get on here.


633
0:21:1,392 --> 0:21:3,761
Rog: Let's go son,
I got my billfold.


634
0:21:3,761 --> 0:21:5,29
Travis Taylor: Well
let's go get some beer,


635
0:21:5,29 --> 0:21:5,863
come on.


636
0:21:5,863 --> 0:21:6,731
Rog: Let's go.


637
0:21:6,731 --> 0:21:7,665
Travis Taylor: Here we go.


638
0:21:7,665 --> 0:21:8,766
Daddy: Hey Rog,
put this on.


639
0:21:8,766 --> 0:21:10,234
Grab that and stick it on.


640
0:21:10,234 --> 0:21:11,936
Travis Taylor: Put that
on your melon head, Rog.


641
0:21:11,936 --> 0:21:13,137
Rog: It's on.


642
0:21:13,137 --> 0:21:14,706
Michael: This is the
best invention yet,


643
0:21:14,706 --> 0:21:16,407
you can drive that
to the beer store.


644
0:21:16,407 --> 0:21:18,776
Daddy: Look at that
pulling a little wagon,


645
0:21:18,776 --> 0:21:20,78
just like he did
with a tricycle


646
0:21:20,78 --> 0:21:21,446
when he was a kid.


647
0:21:21,446 --> 0:21:23,314
Michael: Yeah.


648
0:21:23,314 --> 0:21:25,35
Rog: Turn right here,
right out front.


649
0:21:25,35 --> 0:21:27,985
There we go.


650
0:21:27,985 --> 0:21:33,925
This is where
we need to be.


651
0:21:33,925 --> 0:21:35,93
Travis Taylor: You done?


652
0:21:35,93 --> 0:21:36,27
Rog: Transform.


653
0:21:36,27 --> 0:21:42,834
Travis Taylor:
I heard that.


654
0:21:42,834 --> 0:21:45,303
Rog: Look at you, son.


655
0:21:45,303 --> 0:21:47,171
Travis Taylor: Ah, son!


656
0:21:47,171 --> 0:21:48,339
Rog: Ain't
nothing like it.


657
0:21:48,339 --> 0:21:49,474
Travis Taylor: We
need to get us some


658
0:21:49,474 --> 0:21:52,11
beer up in here.


659
0:21:52,11 --> 0:21:53,845
We need a keg of beer.


660
0:21:53,845 --> 0:21:54,779
Clerk: We can do it.


661
0:21:54,779 --> 0:21:55,813
Travis Taylor: We've
been working hard


662
0:21:55,813 --> 0:21:57,515
building this
thing all weekend.


663
0:21:57,515 --> 0:21:58,983
Let me hold
the right door.


664
0:21:58,983 --> 0:22:0,151
Rog: All right come on.


665
0:22:0,151 --> 0:22:1,85
Travis Taylor: Here we go.


666
0:22:1,85 --> 0:22:2,52
I got it, I got it.


667
0:22:2,52 --> 0:22:11,863
What are we gonna,
go right here?


668
0:22:11,863 --> 0:22:13,131
Rog: Look at it.


669
0:22:13,131 --> 0:22:14,165
Travis Taylor:
This is one of my


670
0:22:14,165 --> 0:22:15,533
favorite things
we've ever done.


671
0:22:15,533 --> 0:22:18,403
Rog: Yeah I am glad
we built it to bubba.


672
0:22:18,403 --> 0:22:20,638
Look at there, let's go.


673
0:22:20,638 --> 0:22:21,973
Travis Taylor: This
is one of the most


674
0:22:21,973 --> 0:22:23,808
amazing things
we ever built.


675
0:22:23,808 --> 0:22:25,91
We took a couple of
electric motors,


676
0:22:25,91 --> 0:22:28,579
ATV parts and some
aluminum framing and


677
0:22:28,579 --> 0:22:32,316
built a real life
transforming ATV,


678
0:22:32,316 --> 0:22:33,584
just like I
use to watch on


679
0:22:33,584 --> 0:22:35,486
Saturday morning cartoons.


680
0:22:35,486 --> 0:22:37,522
Rednecks roll out!


681
0:22:37,522 --> 0:24:37,522
Wahoo!
