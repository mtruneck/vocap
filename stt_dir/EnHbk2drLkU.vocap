###16 PAUL POLANSKY: No country wants them.
###18 They're the people that nobody wants.
###20 And of course, the Albanians fought tooth and nail not to
###23 let them come back to their original neighborhood.
###26 They didn't want Gypsies back in their community.
###28 And this is the bottom line in Kosovo.
###30 
###40 THOMAS MORTON: We are on our way to a refugee camp set up
###43 by the UN in 1999 for the Gypsy community here.
###46 And we've heard terrible things about the conditions of
###49 the camp and health of the people who are there.
###52 S we're just going to go and check it out.
###54 
###57 In simplest terms, the conflict in Kosovo is between
###60 the Serbian north and the Albanian south.
###62 But it's not that simple.
###63 It's not simple at all.
###65 There's Serbian enclaves in the south, Albanian pockets in
###67 the north, something called Illyrians kind of in the
###70 middle, and like the rest of Europe, Gypsies pretty much
###72 everywhere.
###74 The Gypsies, or Roma, are a nomadic people who have been
###77 roaming around Europe since the Roman times.
###79 They're in every major country in Europe and are heavily
###81 discriminated against everywhere they live.
###84 Western Europeans, even supposedly tolerant Dutch
###86 types, accuse Gypsies of being thieving, lying, welfare
###89 cheats, and generally a lot less charming than their
###91 depiction in children's cartoons or that Cher song.
###95 But while in most of Europe, Gypsy mistreatment starts and
###98 ends with making fun of them and not hiring them for jobs,
###101 in Kosovo, their treatment is a million times harsher.
###104 To help solve the problem of the Gypsy refugees, the UN
###107 invited Paul Polansky, an American Gypsy expert, to come
###110 to Kosovo and help them set up camps.
###113 PAUL POLANSKY: The EC Commissioner for Human Rights
###117 issued a written report saying that this was the worst human
###122 rights violation in Europe in the past decade.
###124 
###128 THOMAS MORTON: During the 1999 war in Kosovo, as Albanian and
###131 Serbian forces wailed on each other, NATO began a bombing
###135 campaign in support of the Albanians, displacing hundreds
###138 of thousands of people, including most of
###140 the region's Gypsies.
###142 PAUL POLANSKY: Well, I came to Kosovo in 1999--
###147 as almost every Western journalist--
###150 pro-Albanian.
###151 We'd read in the "New York Times" and heard in the media
###155 that the Albanians were being ethnically
###157 cleansed by the Serbs.
###158 And that's true.
###160 But there was another side of the coin.
###162 And I put it down to the abused becoming the abuser.
###167 The Albanians had suffered under the Serbs for many
###170 generations, and now they have become the abusers.
###174 The UN opened a few IDP camps--
###177 internally displaced people camps-- and so they needed an
###180 expert to advise them.
###182 And that's what they brought me to Kosovo to do.
###184 
###188 SKENDER GUSANI: [SPEAKING SERBIAN]
###189 
###234 THOMAS MORTON: It's obviously depressing in here.
###236 And it's like an atrocity for people in modern Europe or
###240 anywhere to live like this.
###241 But everybody's super house-proud.
###244 They've taken care of this place.
###246 It doesn't smell.
###248 It's clean--
###249 as much as it can be.
###250 Everybody's house is nice.
###251 Everybody's house is decorated great.
###253 
###256 Even the graffiti's pretty well-done.
###258 
###261 SKENDER GUSANI: [SPEAKING SERBIAN]
###262 
###283 THOMAS MORTON: On top of everything-- the cramped
###284 conditions, the hole in the roof, never mind the fact that
###287 if any of the residents step outside the
###288 camp, they risk a beatdown--
###290 every single child inside the camp
###292 has severe lead poisoning.
###295 PAUL POLANSKY: There were about 1,800 tents built on the
###299 tailing stands of the mines.
###301 And the pollution from the smelter drifted right over
###304 their camp.
###306 Their blood samples were sent to a lab in Belgium.
###308 And Belgium said, please retake the test.
###311 There's no such levels in medical literature.
###314 And so the tests are retaken and found that these children
###317 had the highest lead levels in medical literature.
###321 And so, the UN medical team said, Doctor Kouchner, you
###324 must evacuate these camps.
###326 Well, he didn't.
###327 And so that's where I broke my relationship with the UN.
###330 We still have 40 families in a toxic wasteland.
###334 And the other 100 were only moved off in January and
###340 December of this past year.
###342 In 11 years, more than 100 Roma, mainly children, died in
###348 these camps on this toxic wasteland.
###351 SKENDER GUSANI: [SPEAKING SERBIAN]
###352 
###377 THOMAS MORTON: Gusani's camp is actually the second one the
###379 UN set up in the area.
###381 The original camp, the one built over an industrial waste
###384 site which caused all the lead poisoning, is
###385 actually still open.
###387 Conditions there are obviously worse than what we saw in
###389 Leposavic, and the effects of the lead poisoning are even
###392 more drastic.

###451 
###462 THOMAS MORTON: Are these from--
###463 OK.
###463 IVA PROLIC: It's her lead poisoning results.
###465 THOMAS MORTON: OK.
###466 64.
###466 IVA PROLIC: [SPEAKING SERBIAN]
###467 
###473 PAUL POLANSKY: Every single kid that has been moved off
###476 this toxic wasteland has a lead level between 15
###480 micrograms per deciliter and 45 micrograms per deciliter.
###485 Brain damage starts at 10 micrograms per deciliter.
###488 Every kid is born with irreversible brain damage.
###491 And yet, they're telling us there's no medical treatment.
###495 IVA PROLIC: Under is the therapy that she's been into.
###498 THOMAS MORTON: When they stopped giving treatment, did
###500 they say why?
###501 FERUZ JAHIROVIC: [SPEAKING SERBIAN]
###502 
###520 THOMAS MORTON: Have any local or international organizations
###524 offered you medical help?
###526 FERUZ JAHIROVIC: [SPEAKING SERBIAN]
###527 
###550 IVA PROLIC: [SPEAKING SERBIAN]
###553 PAUL POLANSKY: You have to wonder why they put the Gypsy
###555 camp in a place that was first, highly polluted,
###559 second, surrounded by Albanian villages.
###563 Then they withdrew security.
###565 So you have to wonder, did they want us wiped out so they
###567 wouldn't have to handle a Gypsy problem in the future?
###573 THOMAS MORTON: As of making this, it's been 12 years since
###575 the end of the war in Kosovo.
###576 Both temporary refugee camps are still packed.
###579 And what talk there was about helping families move back
###581 home has trickled to a whisper.
###584 The whole deal underscores the fact that, for all its
###586 rhetoric, the UN's not primarily a humanitarian
###588 organization, but a political one.
###591 All this raises the question of whether they're
###592 intervention in these cases actually does more good than
###595 it does harm.
###597 PAUL POLANSKY: We didn't have AIDS in Kosovo until UN police
###600 brought it from Africa.
###601 THOMAS MORTON: Jesus.
###602 PAUL POLANSKY: We didn't have brothels and houses of
###604 prostitution until UN police made loans and investments in
###610 Kosovo to start the drug trade and the prostitution trade.
###614 They're not answerable to anybody, and that's how these
###617 kind of things can happen.
###618 They have diplomatic immunity.
###620 So this is our new crusade, is to try and do draw awareness
###625 that they're refusing to medically treat these kids.
###628 
###631 Now, if it was their kids, they would
###634 find a medical treatment.
###635 
###641 THOMAS MORTON: Kids.
###643 [SERBIAN].
###644 
###650 Keeping up.
###651 This is kind of like the scene in "The Goonies" where Troy
###655 grabs Brent's hand.
###656 But I think the roles are a little reversed.
###658 [SERBIAN].
