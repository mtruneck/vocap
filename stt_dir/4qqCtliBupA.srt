CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: It`s Thursday, I`m
Carl Azuz. This is CNN STUDENT NEWS bringing


2
0:0:16,2 --> 0:0:20,73
global headlines to middle and high school
classrooms around the world. Today, we are


3
0:0:20,73 --> 0:0:22,96
starting in the Middle East.


4
0:0:22,96 --> 0:0:28,14
Fighting in Syria has been going on for almost
two years. But it could stop tomorrow, maybe


5
0:0:28,14 --> 0:0:32,64
just for a little bit. It`s part of a cease-
fire proposal that members of the Syrian government


6
0:0:32,64 --> 0:0:37,55
and the rebels fighting them say they agree
to in principle. Now, in principle and in


7
0:0:37,55 --> 0:0:42,57
reality are two different things. There was
a cease-fire in Syria back in April, but it


8
0:0:42,57 --> 0:0:47,409
barely lasted a day. This one was the idea
of a United Nations representative who is


9
0:0:47,409 --> 0:0:52,159
trying to work on a solution to the fighting.
Tomorrow is the start of the Muslim holiday


10
0:0:52,159 --> 0:0:58,119
called Yid Alada (ph). It lasts for several
days, the question is, will the proposed cease-fire


11
0:0:58,119 --> 0:1:0,96
last that long, if it happens at all.


12
0:1:0,96 --> 0:1:5,72
Out next headline takes us from the Middle
East to the Caribbean Sea. Storm named Sandy


13
0:1:5,72 --> 0:1:10,6
is moving through the area, it became a hurricane
yesterday with wind speeds of around 80 miles


14
0:1:10,6 --> 0:1:15,299
per hour, and it was on a path to hit the
island of Jamaica. People there and across


15
0:1:15,299 --> 0:1:19,48
the Caribbean were warned to get ready for
Sandy. Their concern`s that it could cause


16
0:1:19,48 --> 0:1:22,27
destructive waves and mudslides.


17
0:1:22,27 --> 0:1:27,11
Forecast predicted that after Jamaica the
hurricane would head toward Cuba and the Bahamas.


18
0:1:27,11 --> 0:1:29,83
It`s not expected to heat the United States.


19
0:1:29,83 --> 0:1:31,2
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


20
0:1:31,2 --> 0:1:36,5
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today`s first "Shoutout"
goes out to Mrs. Jimenez`s math classes, at


21
0:1:36,5 --> 0:1:39,75
Cesar Chavez Academy in Denver, Colorado.


22
0:1:39,75 --> 0:1:44,3
Which of these political parties has won a
U.S. presidential election?


23
0:1:44,3 --> 0:1:50,61
Here we go. Is it the Reform Party, Green
Party, Libertarian Party or Whig Party? You`ve


24
0:1:50,61 --> 0:1:58,7
got three seconds, go!


25
0:1:58,7 --> 0:2:4,1
There have been four U.S. presidents who were
members of the Whig Party. That`s your answer


26
0:2:4,1 --> 0:2:6,33
and that`s your "Shoutout."


27
0:2:6,33 --> 0:2:8,69
(END VIDEO CLIP)


28
0:2:8,69 --> 0:2:12,8
AZUZ: You obviously hear about the Republican
and Democratic Parties, but as you saw there


29
0:2:12,8 --> 0:2:16,159
are other political parties in the United
States, there have been throughout the country`s


30
0:2:16,159 --> 0:2:21,0
history. Like the Whigs back in the 1800s.
These days other parties are usually referred


31
0:2:21,0 --> 0:2:25,93
to as third parties. This year`s third party
presidential candidates weren`t part of the


32
0:2:25,93 --> 0:2:30,48
debates between Barack Obama and Mitt Romney.
They got together for their own debate this


33
0:2:30,48 --> 0:2:35,77
week in Chicago. Here is a rundown of those
candidates and the parties they represent.


34
0:2:35,77 --> 0:2:40,16
Former New Mexico governor Gary Johnson. He
is the presidential nominee for the Libertarian


35
0:2:40,16 --> 0:2:45,66
Party. Jill Stein, who once ran for governor
of Massachusetts against Mitt Romney is the


36
0:2:45,66 --> 0:2:47,79
nominee for the Green Party.


37
0:2:47,79 --> 0:2:52,709
Virgil Goode, a former U.S. Congressman from
Virginia is the presidential nominee for the


38
0:2:52,709 --> 0:2:58,99
Constitution Party and Rocky Anderson, the
former mayor of Salt Lake City, Utah is the


39
0:2:58,99 --> 0:2:59,92
nominee for the Justice Party.


40
0:2:59,92 --> 0:3:4,87
One of the big issues for these third party
candidates is ballot access. Other than right-in


41
0:3:4,87 --> 0:3:9,69
vote, people can only vote for these candidates
if their names are on the ballot, and that


42
0:3:9,69 --> 0:3:13,15
varies from state to state for each of these
parties.


43
0:3:13,15 --> 0:3:18,39
Jobs. Economy. Education. Issues that all
of those candidates, the major candidates,


44
0:3:18,39 --> 0:3:22,54
most voters, everybody`s focused on them.
A new national survey shows they are what


45
0:3:22,54 --> 0:3:28,42
you are concerned about too. Junior achievement
spoke to more than 700 Americans ages 14 to


46
0:3:28,42 --> 0:3:34,18
17, and found the two top concerns among them
are jobs and the economy. Many students are


47
0:3:34,18 --> 0:3:37,379
worried, they`ll have trouble finding a job
after finishing school.


48
0:3:37,379 --> 0:3:42,61
64 percent say education is up there, 32 percent
mentioned healthcare.


49
0:3:42,61 --> 0:3:48,459
The survey showed the teens were almost evenly
split about whom they`d vote for. But 57 percent


50
0:3:48,459 --> 0:3:54,69
said the candidates were more concerned with
winning than listening to what Americans thought.


51
0:3:54,69 --> 0:3:58,3

53
0:3:59,489 --> 0:4:4,959
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Time for a "Shoutout"
extra credit. Where was Felix Baumgartner


54
0:4:4,959 --> 0:4:11,26
when he started his record-breaking skydive
from 24 miles up? Was he in the troposphere,


55
0:4:11,26 --> 0:4:20,269
stratosphere, mesosphere or thermosphere?
Rewind that clock to three seconds and go.


56
0:4:20,269 --> 0:4:28,65
Baumgartner was in the stratosphere, which
extends from about 12 to 31 miles above the


57
0:4:28,65 --> 0:4:33,279
earth. That`s your answer and that`s your
"Shoutout" extra credit.


58
0:4:33,279 --> 0:4:34,969
(END VIDEO CLIP)


59
0:4:34,969 --> 0:4:40,83
AZUZ: When Felix Baumgartner took that historic
plunge, at least 8 million people were watching


60
0:4:40,83 --> 0:4:45,979
life. I could not look away. What goes through
your mind when you are standing 24 miles up,


61
0:4:45,979 --> 0:4:50,77
getting ready to free fall faster than the
speed of sound? Baumgartner told Brian Todd


62
0:4:50,77 --> 0:4:51,379
in this interview.


63
0:4:51,379 --> 0:4:51,889
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


64
0:4:51,889 --> 0:4:53,43
FELIX BAUMGARTNER: I`m going home now.


65
0:4:53,43 --> 0:4:56,4
BRIAN TODD, CNN CORRESPONDENT: What is your
feeling at that point? You are on the ledge,


66
0:4:56,4 --> 0:5:0,849
you can`t get back in the capsule. What are
you? What`s going through your mind?


67
0:5:0,849 --> 0:5:5,599
BAUMGARTNER: Well, I kind of like that part
of the jump, because it means you are already


68
0:5:5,599 --> 0:5:13,469
outside, everything worked well. And if you
have a problem, you know, probably (ph) jumping


69
0:5:13,469 --> 0:5:18,729
off is the fastest and safest way, because
now you are falling towards a much healthier


70
0:5:18,729 --> 0:5:21,99
environment, you know, you are falling towards
more pressure, towards more oxygen, and if


71
0:5:21,99 --> 0:5:26,319
you need medical treatment, you know, this
is the fastest way down.


72
0:5:26,319 --> 0:5:28,69
So to me this is an easy step.


73
0:5:28,69 --> 0:5:35,5
TODD: At this point, you had us all very scared.
Did you feel like you were going to die at


74
0:5:35,5 --> 0:5:35,479
that point?


75
0:5:35,479 --> 0:5:38,27
BAUMGARTNER: No, no, no. I never had that
impression that I`m going to die, I always


76
0:5:38,27 --> 0:5:41,369
had the impression, if, this goes on forever,
I`m not going to break the speed of sound.


77
0:5:41,369 --> 0:5:43,749
TODD: How did you bring yourself out of that
spin?


78
0:5:43,749 --> 0:5:48,629
BAUMGARTNER: I was slowly trying to figure
out how to stop this, so it was use your legs


79
0:5:48,629 --> 0:5:52,919
and arms, but you have to do it really gentle,
because if you travel 830 miles an hour, you


80
0:5:52,919 --> 0:5:57,779
cannot stick your arm out like this, because
this would create a rapid onset, and then


81
0:5:57,779 --> 0:6:2,46
you cannot stop it anymore. So you slowly
put out your arm or your legs trying to figure


82
0:6:2,46 --> 0:6:8,2
out what helps, and I did it, I did it a couple
of times, and I could see sometimes it was


83
0:6:8,2 --> 0:6:12,339
getting worse, sometimes it was getting better,
then I figured out the way how to do it and


84
0:6:12,339 --> 0:6:12,889
then I had it.


85
0:6:12,889 --> 0:6:16,969
TODD ( voice over): Baumgartner says he cried
twice on the helicopter ride back to mission


86
0:6:16,969 --> 0:6:19,729
control. Then celebrated all night with his
team.


87
0:6:19,729 --> 0:6:23,419
(on camera): What has your life been like
since the 14th? How was your life changed


88
0:6:23,419 --> 0:6:29,169
since the moment you went?


89
0:6:29,169 --> 0:6:36,319
BAUMGARTNER: As a person, it didn`t change.
I`m still the same guy. But as soon as you


90
0:6:36,319 --> 0:6:39,27
start traveling, as soon as you get on the
plane, as soon as you are at the airport out


91
0:6:39,27 --> 0:6:42,69
on the street, people do recognize my face.


92
0:6:42,69 --> 0:6:42,719
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Thanks.


93
0:6:42,719 --> 0:6:43,58
BAUMGARTNER: Thank you, guys.


94
0:6:43,58 --> 0:6:44,789
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: I was scared.


95
0:6:44,789 --> 0:6:47,439
BAUMGARTNER: You were scared? I was a little
bit scared.


96
0:6:47,439 --> 0:6:49,319
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: You did it for all of
us.


97
0:6:49,319 --> 0:6:51,229
BAUMGARTNER: Yes. Thank you very much, I appreciate
it.


98
0:6:51,229 --> 0:6:54,409
TODD: You gave us all a huge charge that day.
And we thank you for it.


99
0:6:54,409 --> 0:6:55,559
BAUMGARTNER: I appreciate it.


100
0:6:55,559 --> 0:6:55,86
TODD: Thank you.


101
0:6:55,86 --> 0:6:56,569
BAUMGARTNER: Thank you very much.


102
0:6:56,569 --> 0:6:57,33
(END VIDEOTAPE)


103
0:6:57,33 --> 0:7:1,219
AZUZ: When she was 12, Kathryn DiMaria was
thinking about something that a lot of you


104
0:7:1,219 --> 0:7:5,449
probably thought about at age 12. It`s your
first car. Kathryn told her parents she`d


105
0:7:5,449 --> 0:7:9,77
buy it with babysitting money, but it was
another part of a plan that really got their


106
0:7:9,77 --> 0:7:10,29
attention.


107
0:7:10,29 --> 0:7:10,569
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


108
0:7:10,569 --> 0:7:14,8
KATHRYN DIMARIA: Most of the cool part to
learn has been the engines, because there


109
0:7:14,8 --> 0:7:19,2
are just so many moving parts, and you have
to do it exactly how it tells you, and so


110
0:7:19,2 --> 0:7:24,679
that`s been the hardest part. I`m Kathryn
DiMaria, I`m 14 years old, I`m from Mount


111
0:7:24,679 --> 0:7:28,439
Pleasant, Michigan, and I decided to build
the car because I`ve been to a bunch of car


112
0:7:28,439 --> 0:7:32,619
shows and things, so I became really interested
in them, and so I (inaudible) here, because


113
0:7:32,619 --> 0:7:35,289
I just like the little car.


114
0:7:35,289 --> 0:7:39,499
JERRY DIMARIA: Kathryn about two years ago,
when she was 12 years old, came to us and


115
0:7:39,499 --> 0:7:44,59
said, Mom, Dad, I`d like to rebuild the car.
And we kind of went -- really?


116
0:7:44,59 --> 0:7:49,669
So, she had all kinds of reasons as terms
of, you know, she`d learn how to rebuild the


117
0:7:49,669 --> 0:7:53,58
car, she would be able to do all of her own
mechanics. There is only two seats in the


118
0:7:53,58 --> 0:7:58,899
car she wanted to rebuild, she would pay for
it all herself, and so we thought about it


119
0:7:58,899 --> 0:8:2,61
and said, all right, well, let her try it
and figure it`ll last about two or three months.


120
0:8:2,61 --> 0:8:7,789
Two years later, here we are at Makers Fair,
rebuilding an engine.


121
0:8:7,789 --> 0:8:12,899
KATHRYN DIMARIA: All my family`s helped a
lot. My mom has helped me with most of like


122
0:8:12,899 --> 0:8:17,509
the creative side of it, like here is how
you sew things together, here is how you piece


123
0:8:17,509 --> 0:8:22,699
everything together. My dad`s more like my
information technician person, because he


124
0:8:22,699 --> 0:8:26,719
understands where everything needs to go,
he understands the information behind it.


125
0:8:26,719 --> 0:8:31,479
And then there is my sister who is our part-time
photographer, I guess, you could say.


126
0:8:31,479 --> 0:8:35,94
JERRY DIMARIA: We figured, well, she`ll learn
a little bit about mechanics and how to redo


127
0:8:35,94 --> 0:8:40,409
a car. She`s definitely learned that. But
at the same time, as you can tell if you are


128
0:8:40,409 --> 0:8:46,19
watching this, she`s just talked to CNN. So
she`s also learned a lot about how to talk


129
0:8:46,19 --> 0:8:50,52
with individuals, how to interact with adults,
how to do independent research and learn how


130
0:8:50,52 --> 0:8:54,59
to do the things that she doesn`t know how
to do. And then try to apply that skill set.


131
0:8:54,59 --> 0:8:59,18
So, there`s been a whole lot of learning outside
of just auto mechanics that have gone on.


132
0:8:59,18 --> 0:8:59,84
(END VIDEOTAPE)


133
0:8:59,84 --> 0:9:5,0
AZUZ: A high school in Chicago has an interesting
tradition where students start randomly dancing


134
0:9:5,0 --> 0:9:11,94
in the halls. Like this guy. The man he is
dancing in front of here is the dean of students,


135
0:9:11,94 --> 0:9:15,71
and the footwork is so fancy, that he dances
right out of his shoe. So does the dean have


136
0:9:15,71 --> 0:9:22,52
a response? You`d better believe it. The dean
took Irish dance lessons as a kid, and did


137
0:9:22,52 --> 0:9:28,61
his own sick moves. This Youtube video is
one sure way to make sure everyone shows up


138
0:9:28,61 --> 0:9:33,7
in school, because once they`ve seen it, they`ll
always want to be there for attendance. The


139
0:9:33,7 --> 0:9:36,78
dean stepped up, we are going to step out.
We`ll hit the dance floor again tomorrow for


140
0:9:36,78 --> 0:11:36,78
more CNN STUDENT NEWS. See you then.
