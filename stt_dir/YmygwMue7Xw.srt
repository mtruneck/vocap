A study shows that unshaved men can
detect bed bugs better than women,


2
0:0:7,41 --> 0:0:12,36
proving evolution.
Potholer needs to be FILLED IN on


3
0:0:12,36 --> 0:0:14,94
thermodynamics
And we open a few letter bombs from our


4
0:0:14,94 --> 0:0:18,66
viewers - all this and more, coming up in
this edition of Genesis Week.


5
0:0:18,66 --> 0:0:34,67
<music>


6
0:0:34,67 --> 0:0:39,66
And a welcome to this episode of Genesis
Week, the weekly program of creationary


7
0:0:39,66 --> 0:0:44,47
commentary on news, views and events
pertaining to the origins controversy,


8
0:0:44,47 --> 0:0:49,92
exclusive right here on youtube.  The Bible
does not say "Be ye transformed by the


9
0:0:49,92 --> 0:0:54,92
removal of your mind" but rather we here
at Genesis Week believe God gave you a


10
0:0:54,92 --> 0:1:0,55
brain for a reason, and so we use our
brains in search of the truth.  


11
0:1:0,55 --> 0:1:4,78

14
0:1:13,6 --> 0:1:18,39
A December 14th "Biology Letters" paper
by Isabelle Dean and Michael T.


15
0:1:18,39 --> 0:1:23,52
Siva-Jothy reported the results of an
experiment where they shaved the


16
0:1:23,52 --> 0:1:27,12
armpits of men and women to see if they
could detect bed bugs better.


17
0:1:27,12 --> 0:1:34,66
<laughing>Ya can't make this stuff up.
Now of course, in order to get research


18
0:1:34,66 --> 0:1:38,9
funding, you must give a nod to evolution,
and your results MUST support


19
0:1:38,9 --> 0:1:45,26
evolution....even if the results don't
support evolution. For example, in the


20
0:1:45,26 --> 0:2:4,78
abstract we read:


21
0:2:4,78 --> 0:2:10,81
Talk about a stretch!  Our lack of hair is
really unexplainable by evolutionary


22
0:2:10,81 --> 0:2:15,7
theory, so we must find some advantage
of the lack of human hair to offer an


23
0:2:15,7 --> 0:2:17,99
evolutionary explanation!


24
0:2:17,99 --> 0:2:46,66
So what did they find? Well, I like the way
Bob Yirka at physorg.com put it:


25
0:2:46,66 --> 0:2:51,71
Wwwwooowwww...  This report has the
potential to affect online dating site


26
0:2:51,71 --> 0:2:56,63
profile photos for men, as clearly ladies
are after the hairiest guy out there.


27
0:2:56,63 --> 0:3:2,25
After all, based on this scientific report,
that's what you ladies are after - a hairy


28
0:3:2,25 --> 0:3:4,83
guy which means he's bed-bug free,
right?


29
0:3:4,83 --> 0:3:8,61
This is just another example of how far
people will reach to make alleged


30
0:3:8,61 --> 0:3:14,25
"benefits" to be alleged "evidence for
evolution."  Even when evolution really


31
0:3:14,25 --> 0:3:19,73
cannot explain the evidence - like in this
case, the lack of fur on humans.  But it


32
0:3:19,73 --> 0:3:21,82
sure makes a funny story!


33
0:3:21,82 --> 0:3:26,31
youtuber Potholer54 recently posted a
video "setting fire to creationist straw


34
0:3:26,31 --> 0:3:30,23
men" - which really strikes me as ironic,
as he delved into trying to debunk


35
0:3:30,23 --> 0:3:35,43
thermodynamics and subsequently
burned himself so bad. Potholer definitely


36
0:3:35,43 --> 0:3:39,85
needs to be "filled in" on what
thermodynamics is, and in fact, I'll have a


37
0:3:39,85 --> 0:3:44,57
rant coming out shortly, mostly devoted
to his video because while his discussion


38
0:3:44,57 --> 0:3:51,11
of thermodynamics was SO bad and so
full of flagrant, gross error, sadly, his


39
0:3:51,11 --> 0:3:55,7
response was typical of the
anti-creationary community.  But I bring


40
0:3:55,7 --> 0:3:59,8
that up, along with the snowflakes that
potholer mentioned, because Nature


41
0:3:59,8 --> 0:4:3,23
magazine also had an article come out on
the incredible variety snowflakes can


42
0:4:3,23 --> 0:4:6,96
produce.... and just because it's winter
here in Canada.  What a better time to deal


43
0:4:6,96 --> 0:4:11,5
with what we creationists refer to as "the
stupid snowflake argument."


44
0:4:11,5 --> 0:4:17,9
That's right - the claim is that incredibly
complex snowflakes can form, therefore


45
0:4:17,9 --> 0:4:22,69
the laws of entropy (or disorder) are
"violated," therefore we can conclude that


46
0:4:22,69 --> 0:4:27,61
life can arise from non-life.
Of course, potholer first pulled the "open


47
0:4:27,61 --> 0:4:32,3
systems" argument, claiming that energy
coming in from the sun can cause life to


48
0:4:32,3 --> 0:4:39,2
arise - and then cites snowflakes and
sunflowers as examples.  This makes it


49
0:4:39,2 --> 0:4:43,19
evident that potholer doesn't have a CLUE
what he's talking about. First of all, as I


50
0:4:43,19 --> 0:4:47,74
already pointed out in a previous rant,
"closed thermodynamic systems" do not


51
0:4:47,74 --> 0:4:52,48
exist!  The well established laws of
thermodynamics were formed to describe


52
0:4:52,48 --> 0:4:57,7
what happens in open systems.
So why then would potholer talk about


53
0:4:57,7 --> 0:5:2,45
closed systems? I can only think of two
possible reasons: Ignorance, or


54
0:5:2,45 --> 0:5:4,96
obfuscation.


55
0:5:4,96 --> 0:5:9,3
Snowflakes form by cooling, yet potholer
was calling upon energy from the sun to


56
0:5:9,3 --> 0:5:14,45
magically defy disorder.  Energy from the
sun plays a role in evaporation of water,


57
0:5:14,45 --> 0:5:18,23
yes, but energy from the sun melts
snowflakes.


58
0:5:18,23 --> 0:5:23,3
Then potholer takes a quantum leap of
faith, comparing a snowflake to the


59
0:5:23,3 --> 0:5:30,5
sunflower!  What???  That's like saying
that because a rock formed by natural


60
0:5:30,5 --> 0:5:35,13
processes, we can therefore conclude
that the space shuttle can form by natural


61
0:5:35,13 --> 0:5:40,4
processes!  And even that crude
comparison doesn't do it justice, because


62
0:5:40,4 --> 0:5:44,29
the space shuttle cannot reproduce,
cannot repair itself, cannot find and


63
0:5:44,29 --> 0:5:49,24
process its own energy, etc...  Do you
know what the odds are that the space


64
0:5:49,24 --> 0:5:54,45
shuttle could form by natural processes?
It's quite easy to calculate actually - the


65
0:5:54,45 --> 0:5:58,73
odds are ZERO that the space shuttle
could form by natural processes, and so


66
0:5:58,73 --> 0:6:5,22
goes even the very proteins that the
sunflower needs in order to live.  But to be


67
0:6:5,22 --> 0:6:9,8
honest, perhaps we should temper those
odds with the fact that Kim Jong ill got 11


68
0:6:9,8 --> 0:6:16,7
holes in one on his first game of golf.  Ya, I
don't believe that either.


69
0:6:16,7 --> 0:6:21,36
Snowflakes most certainly do follow the
laws of thermodynamics and entropy, and


70
0:6:21,36 --> 0:6:28,25
snowflakes have absolutely nothing to do
with life forming from non-life.


71
0:6:28,25 --> 0:6:35,17
<scary music>
Wahoo! Mail for me?


72
0:6:35,17 --> 0:6:40,11
<scary music>


73
0:6:40,11 --> 0:6:43,76
I wanted to give a special thank you to all
of my subscribers and viewers - thanks


74
0:6:43,76 --> 0:6:47,43
for watching, and thanks for commenting.
Please know, that while I try and read


75
0:6:47,43 --> 0:6:51,12
comments, I typically can't get to
responding to them, as my videos get just


76
0:6:51,12 --> 0:6:56,0
waaay too many comments.  However, I
will try to highlight some of your


77
0:6:56,0 --> 0:6:59,59
comments here and there, especially on
Genesis Week.


78
0:6:59,59 --> 0:7:3,14
One youtube skeptic, apparently not
wanting to make his statements


79
0:7:3,14 --> 0:7:7,48
publically, wrote to me privately.  He was
critical of my second pilot Genesis week


80
0:7:7,48 --> 0:7:12,2
episode, criticizing me for allegedly not
knowing that dinosaurs ARE considered


81
0:7:12,2 --> 0:7:17,8
to be birds.  I'm well aware of said claim,
however, apparently you missed my point,


82
0:7:17,8 --> 0:7:25,67
so let me make it again:  Calling a dinosaur
a bird does not make it a bird!  <swoosh>


83
0:7:25,67 --> 0:7:37,29
<T-rex clucking like a chicken>
Bagaack!


84
0:7:37,29 --> 0:7:40,68
<swoosh>
Citing cladistic diagrams is completely


85
0:7:40,68 --> 0:7:45,16
bogus, because it's easy to show just
how flexible "cladistics" are to


86
0:7:45,16 --> 0:7:49,58
accomodate the current favourite
evolutionary theory - in fact I wrote about


87
0:7:49,58 --> 0:7:54,62
this on my blog where some evolutionism
thinkers were arguing over whether a


88
0:7:54,62 --> 0:8:3,97
hippo was most like a whale, a pig, or a
dog!  And they get paid for this!


89
0:8:3,97 --> 0:8:9,37
Oh, and by the way, there are multiple,
well-respected EVOLUTIONARY scientists


90
0:8:9,37 --> 0:8:13,51
who disagree with you and claim that
dinosaurs are not birds, they believe birds


91
0:8:13,51 --> 0:8:18,33
evolved separate from the dinosaurs.  So
much for cladistics.


92
0:8:18,33 --> 0:8:22,47
I just released another CrEvo Rant on the
origin of life and evolution.  You can click


93
0:8:22,47 --> 0:8:26,4
on the video here and go watch it right
now, or the video will be provided again at


94
0:8:26,4 --> 0:8:28,31
the end of this program.

The trolls were hard at work again,
flaunting their flagrant ignorance on so


100
0:9:8,84 --> 0:9:12,82
many subjects that I felt like the last male
rabbit in a world of female rabbits during

mating season - wherever do I begin?
Most of the skeptical comments are really


102
0:9:17,58 --> 0:9:21,62
not even worthy of a response.  However,
some of you viewers stepped in with your

You're right on the money. The
differences between humans and chimps


107
0:9:59,23 --> 0:10:3,88
are far beyond the genetic, but even just
the genetic differences are fatal to the


108
0:10:3,88 --> 0:10:8,21
evolutionary model. For example,
thepseudosciencefoundation never


109
0:10:8,21 --> 0:10:14,18
mentions orfan genes, which are a 0%
match between chimps and humans - and


110
0:10:14,18 --> 0:10:18,1
there's hundreds of orfan genes!  Thanks
for writing in Tubenotme, and for the rest


111
0:10:18,1 --> 0:10:22,21
