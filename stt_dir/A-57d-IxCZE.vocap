###0 STEVE SPANGLER: All right, it's Thanksgiving.
###1 This is going to be a very cool episode, because you are
###4 going to use common household items to do amazing things for
###7 your friends.
###8 You're going to amaze them.
###9 I just know it.
###10 [THEME MUSIC PLAYING]
###12 STEVE SPANGLER: I'm Steve Spangler, and I'm all about
###14 making science fun.
###15 For the last 20 years, I've been teaching ways to turn
###18 ordinary science experiments into unforgettable learning
###21 experiences.
###22 I have an amazing team who will do whatever it takes to
###25 affect the way people think about science.
###27 And to do that, I live by one motto--
###30 make it big, do it right, give it class.
###33 
###39 Just finished that great Thanksgiving meal.
###41 Boy, am I full.
###43 So the deal is this-- there's lots of toothpicks around.
###47 And if you're like 80 years old, you know what this is,
###49 but if you're a little kid you don't even know why they even
###51 use toothpicks.
###52 For science experiments.
###54 Here's what you're going to do-- you're going to bend some
###56 toothpicks like this, and you're going to form them into
###58 the shape of a star.
###59 This is what we want our little project to look like,
###62 but the toothpicks actually have to start out on a plate
###65 like this right here.
###66 And without touching it, you turn it from this into this.
###70 How do you do that?
###71 I'll show you.
###72 Watch.
###73 
###76 It didn't work.
###77 Since that last strategy clearly did not work, we're
###80 making another one.
###81 So notice how you break it just like this, not all the
###83 way through.
###84 This completes a last little piece right here.
###87 So the object is to go from here and to make it
###90 open up as a star.
###91 Believe it or not, the secret is a straw.
###93 And you're going to put the straw down in some water, and
###96 put your finger in the end, and pick up just a
###98 little bit of water.
###99 You don't want much at all-- just a couple drops.
###101 It goes right into the middle-- watch.
###103 
###111 It's not that the water just pushed out the toothpicks, but
###114 instead the toothpicks absorbed the water.
###116 And when it absorbs the water, the little capillaries that
###118 make up the wood literally went from this to
###122 pushing back out again.
###123 And in doing so, it literally just pushed those pieces out
###127 to form the little star.
###128 So you might want to practice and try some different
###130 things-- some different kinds of liquid, maybe different
###132 kinds and styles of toothpick to be able to
###135 get your best burst.
###135 But once you've got it, hoard the toothpicks, because you're
###139 going to want to do it forever.
###140 It's pretty cool.
###142 This little trick is going to teach all those people who
###144 give you more silverware than you need at your
###146 fancy little dinner.
###147 You know how they always give you two forks?
###149 Well, snag one of them, because you're going to need
###151 two of them at the very end of the meal.
###153 And you're going to need to have a water glass.
###156 And a toothpick.
###158 So here's what the challenge is.
###159 You need to balance these forks on the rim of the glass,
###164 using just this toothpick.
###165 And you can't break the glass, and you
###167 can't use Gorilla Glue.
###169 That's pretty much everything.
###171 Well, and magnets.
###172 And you can't use duct tape--
###174 for sure not duct tape.
###175 You can't use Elmer's glue, Superglue, c-clamps, radiator
###180 hose clamps--
###182 any other things like that.
###185 That's what you can't use.
###186 You just can use the toothpick and this.
###189 And your brain.
###191 So here's the secret.
###192 You're going to jam these little tines
###194 together, like that.
###195 So this is what you're looking for, this little system.
###199 And then it's going to take a little work, but you're going
###202 to try to get the toothpick in through both sides.
###208 I've got an opening here at the top that you can just work
###211 the toothpick in a little bit more, and you've got it.
###214 So here's what we're going to try to do.
###215 We're going to try to rest this on the edge of the glass.
###219 The trick here is to get the center of gravity down below
###224 that balance point right there.
###225 So the object here is to balance it on the glass.
###229 It's going to go to the very edge.
###231 And you've got it.
###233 A lot of people think it's done.
###234 No, it's not done, because now we introduce
###236 the element of fire.
###238 Watch.
###240 See, you burn this part here, and you burn this part over
###245 here, and here comes pending disaster.
###251 You'll notice that the stick stopped burning the moment it
###254 got to the glass.
###255 That's because the glass-- the rim of the glass absorbed that
###258 heat energy away from the wood and caused it to go out.
###261 Same thing with the metal over here.
###263 It absorbs that heat energy.
###265 So it just naturally goes out, burns everything to the very
###268 end, because the real support is only at that one point, and
###271 you have a system that is in perfect balance.
###274 And a trick that's guaranteed to amaze your friends.
###278 It's pretty good.
###280 So this one, you're going to need to have some money-- a
###282 couple nickels.
###283 So clear an area on the table, put the nickel on the table,
###286 put the other nickel so it's perpendicular, like this.
###290 And of course, the theme today, toothpicks--
###292 so you're going to need to have that
###293 toothpick right there.
###295 You're going to try to balance the toothpick right on the
###298 edge like that.
###300 I can kick it over just a little bit more.
###303 Balance it just like that.
###304 Now, the object is to move the toothpick, but you can't touch
###308 the toothpick.
###308 And the problem is, it's so precariously balanced that
###311 just breathing on it would move it, so that's where the
###313 cup comes in.
###315 Because now you cover the whole thing with the cup, and
###318 now, without touching the glass, the object is to move
###323 the toothpick.
###324 How would you do it?
###325 The secret--
###327 a balloon.
###328 Blow it up.
###330 
###335 Now you're not going to pop the balloon and cause that
###337 burst to move it.
###338 You're actually going to use something as simple as static
###341 electricity.
###343 So you're just going to build up some static electricity
###345 here-- that's about right.
###346 Now we're going to take that over and get it close to the
###348 toothpick, and watch.
###350 So you're just trying to discharge the electrons in the
###355 balloon, and these electrons literally are able to push
###360 that stick around, and to move it in such a way until it
###364 finally discharges.
###366 But it totally looks like magic, doesn't it?
###369 And very cool how you can move it even under the glass.
###372 Now, even with the glass off, you can try it.
###375 Try different kinds of glasses.
###376 See whether or not plastic is the only thing that you can
###379 use, or whether or not an actual glass
###384 container will work.
###385 It's ridiculously cool, and it almost looks like magic.
###389 Secret?
###390 Electrons.
###391 [HIGH-PITCHED NOISE]
###392 STEVE SPANGLER: It's the sound that annoyed every mom in the
###395 world, unless your mom was the cool mom that actually taught
###398 you how to do this.
###399 My mom.
###400 So listen to this.
###402 [HIGH-PITCHED NOISE]
###402 STEVE SPANGLER: It's very, very cool.
###403 The way that this works is stick and slide.
###406 Not every cup works.
###407 Like for example, this cup here doesn't work
###410 very well at all.
###411 Even with water inside--
###412 [SCREECHING NOISE]
###412 STEVE SPANGLER: --you just get this screeching thing.
###414 Not as good as this thin-walled glass here.
###417 [HIGH-PITCHED NOISE]
###418 STEVE SPANGLER: The secret is stick and slide.
###420 Your finger sticks and then slides, and that stick and
###422 slide creates a vibration.
###423 [HIGH-PITCHED NOISE]
###425 STEVE SPANGLER: Vibration creates a sound.
###426 Here's what I'm going to ask you do, is find two glasses.
###429 Start with them identical.
###431 That's usually not hard, since you buy them in a set, right?
###434 And try to get them so they're exactly the same sound.
###437 We're going to try to make this so it's sympathetic.
###439 We'd like to have the vibration from one go
###442 to the other one.
###442 In comes the toothpick.
###444 Balance a toothpick on the rim of the glass that you're not
###447 going to vibrate.
###449 Take the other glass.
###450 Vibrate it.
###451 Get it close, but not close enough to touch, and see
###454 whether or not you can transfer the vibration.
###456 Watch.
###457 [HIGH-PITCHED NOISE]
###459 STEVE SPANGLER: See?
###460 If you start to transfer that vibration, you get movement in
###463 the toothpick.
###464 That's what you're looking for.
###465 You're looking for that vibration.
###467 [GASP]
###467 Forwards, and sometimes going the opposite direction can
###470 make it go opposite.
###471 
###474 Guaranteed not to amaze your friends, but to annoy
###476 everybody at the table.
###478 [HIGH-PITCHED NOISE]
###479 STEVE SPANGLER: OK, somebody will be amazed.
###481 If you look this up online, you're going to find a lot of
###483 people doing this, but the directions they have are you
###485 have to have identical glasses,
###487 identical amounts of water--
###489 [HIGH-PITCHED NOISE]
###491 STEVE SPANGLER: --and that's how the vibration moves from
###493 one glass to the next.
###494 However, a little experimentation, which now
###496 turns this into a real experiment and not just a
###498 table trick, is to find two different glasses.
###501 So for example, look at this.
###503 Two different style of wine glasses--
###505 one a little shorter, and one a little bit bigger.
###508 That means that it had different amounts of water--
###511 [HIGH-PITCHED NOISE]
###512 STEVE SPANGLER: --to give you the same sound.
###514 Listen.
###514 [HIGH-PITCHED NOISE]
###515 STEVE SPANGLER: Pretty close.
###517 Let's see whether or not we can cause the
###520 toothpick to move.
###521 
###524 Watch.
###525 [HIGH-PITCHED NOISE]
###527 STEVE SPANGLER: See, it will still move, because it's not
###530 about the volume of the water or the size of the glass.
###532 It's about the frequency of the tone that you're creating.
###536 That energy is literally transferring from one
###539 container to the next.
###540 Look at that toothpick move.
###542 It's all because we tried to experiment and prove something
###546 wrong that somebody said was an absolute.
###551 This is beautiful.
###553 So what do you do at the end of any good meal?
###555 Sit here and pick your teeth?
###556 No.
###557 Even though you've just amazed everyone with your little
###559 toothpick tricks, you offer to clean up.
###561 But you always start with the tablecloth, because that's
###565 what's dirty first.
###566 So you just take the tablecloth like this, and--
###570 perfect.
###570 Now you can wipe your mouth, and you're ready to go.
###574 
###578 All right, you want to learn how to do
###579 the tablecloth trick.
###580 It's actually very cool, and one of the secrets is
###583 selecting the right tablecloth.
###584 Now most tablecloths that people use are nice, and they
###587 don't work.
###588 And the reason they don't work is because they have a hem.
###591 Look at this one here.
###592 There's no hem.
###594 See, I just literally cut the edges off.
###597 This means that it gets to be a little frayed after a while,
###599 and it's not very pretty.
###601 But this is exactly what we want, because we don't want
###603 there to be any bump or anything that would interrupt
###606 the flow of the cloth.
###607 When you learn how to do the tablecloth trick, you're
###609 learning about the laws of inertia, or the tendency of an
###611 object to stay at rest until a force acts upon it.
###615 Thanks, Newton.
###617 It starts with a little bit of practice.
###619 You start this way.
###620 Now, I've got a piece of cloth here that's probably 1 meter
###623 by 1 meter, so almost a yard by a yard.
###626 You're going to practice doing this-- you lay it out on the
###629 table, and your hands, I think, are the secret.
###631 Because you hold the cloth like this.
###633 I actually fold it up a little bit in my hands and hang it
###637 over the edge like this.
###638 I never go above the table.
###640 I'm going to start below the table.
###641 It forces me to pull straight down.
###644 You pull straight down to your toes.
###647 So you can hear the whipping sound.
###648 Listen to this, listen.
###649 [WHIPPING SOUND]
###650 STEVE SPANGLER: That's what you're looking for.
###652 Practice that a couple times.
###653 All right, a hundred times, I don't care.
###656 But if you don't practice this, you're going to be
###658 ruining some dishes.
###660 Second thing--
###661 the dishes.
###662 Notice how this is smooth on the bottom.
###664 You're going to run to garage sales and try to find dishes
###667 that are smooth here on the bottom.
###669 If they're rough or they have-- the more expensive they
###672 are, probably the more rough they're going to be, with a
###674 little edge, and you don't want those.
###675 So this nice and smooth will be perfect, because we want
###678 very little friction between the cloth and the dishes.
###680 So that when you're pulling the cloth out from underneath,
###683 then it slides very easily.
###684 So find dishes that have no little things that will grab
###689 on the bottom, and this'll be perfect.
###691 
###694 Third part, the glasses.
###696 I like to call these the convincer, because glasses by
###699 themselves are perfect, especially when you take water
###702 and you fill these with water.
###704 What you're actually doing, believe it or not, is making
###706 it easier on yourself, because you're increasing the mass.
###709 See, once you increase the mass, you increase the
###711 inertia, or the tendency of an object to stay at rest until
###715 some sort of force acts upon it.
###717 The force here-- gravity pulling down.
###719 Of course, the table below, supporting it, so there's no
###722 movement at all.
###723 And hopefully, we can slip the tablecloth right out.
###726 Other things you're going to need-- forks, of course, find
###729 a knife, spoon.
###730 The only thing that you don't want to use--
###732 wineglasses.
###733 See, they're too heavy on the top, and so a wineglass can
###736 fairly easily tip over.
###737 You might find one that works well, but for me, this seems
###740 to be the perfect setup.
###742 Remember, straight down, and notice that I didn't put a lot
###746 of the tablecloth over there.
###747 As I'm practicing, I'm going to set this off to the side
###750 like this and allow the edge to sneak out first.
###753 It just makes it a little bit easier as you're starting.
###755 Right straight down to your toes, watch this--
###756 three, two--
###759 it's that easy.
###761 The best part of learning the tablecloth trick is you can
###763 come up with your own variations.
###764 So here, take a look at this.
###765 Everybody's seen the standard whip the tablecloth off, and
###768 you've got a couple dishes.
###769 Let's try this.
###769 Here's the glass here.
###771 Here's the plate, glasses.
###773 And now you take another plate on top of the glass like this.
###776 And now the glass goes on top.
###781 This is going to be hard enough-- don't get crazy.
###783 All right, here we go.
###784 Three, two, one--
###788 awesome.
###788 [THEME MUSIC PLAYING]
###802 STEVE SPANGLER: Well, now you have everything you need to
###803 ensure that Aunt Gertrude never invites you over to her
###806 house for Thanksgiving again.
###808 Because who likes to go to her house anyway?
###812 So, Happy Halloween.
###814 DIRECTOR: Cut!
###814 STEVE SPANGLER: No--
###816 You know what's fun to do?
###817 Maybe you don't like going to Thanksgiving dinner.
###819 So here's what you do-- glue all the plates secretly to the
###821 tablecloth, and when you whip it off--
###823 that's a surprise.
###826 You know the best part of doing this stuff?
###827 It's because you never have to sit at the adult table again,
###830 because who likes to sit at the adult table?
###831 Especially next to Uncle Bob.
###832 Uncle Bob's always going--
###833 [SNORING SOUNDS]
###834 and then you've got Clyde over there, who's always telling
###836 war stories. "You know, back when I was a kid--" You don't
###839 want to sit at that table.
###840 You want to sit at the fun table, the kids' table.
###841 Problem with sitting at the kids' table?
###844 Boogers.
###845
