###2 Most people are not really hurt by the world.
###7 They're hurt by their own expectations.
###12 I read somewhere that H.G. Wells was very disappointed in people.
###18 He thought that we would have arrived at more of a scientific community
###23 than what we have today
###25 but what hurt him was not the world.
###29 It was his expectations.
###31 He expected people to lean more toward science
###35 and less toward metaphysics.
###38 He suspected that the system
###42 would gather intelligence and know the right direction.
###46 So what really hurt him was his own expectations.
###51 The real answer to that question is:
###54 Whatever happens in the world is real.
###58 What you think should happen is not real.
###62 So you're not disappointed by the world.
###65 You're disappointed by your own projections.
###68 If you meet a person, you say "There's a wonderful person"
###72 and they turn out to be different than you suspected
###75 you get mad, and you say "She isn't that wonderful"
###78 or "He isn't that wonderful"
###81 and it's your own projections that you're mad at.
###85 The right way to look at a person is:
###87 "I don't know enough about them to make a judgment."
###92 In time, when you make a judgment
###96 you say "Up to now, they appear to be so-so."
###101 But something may come back that reminds them of something else.
###107 So they hurt you. They really don't hurt you.
###110 They're normal. That is, normal to their values.
###115 Like my mother would believe in religion
###118 because it's normal to her background
###121 and when things get tough, she prays, rather then
###125 because she doesn't know what else to do.
###129 What you have to do is take time out
###132 and try to inform people as to how to look at things.
###136 It may take you two or three years to do that
###141 but we would expect to find people that understand what we say.
###145 When they shake their heads like "Yes"
###148 that doesn't mean they understand.
###150 It means they understand a limited amount.
###153 So, the point is:
###156 What are your expectations?
###159 Now, in chemistry, if you mix certain things together
###162 certain things happen, at a certain temperature.
###166 At different temperatures, the same thing doesn't happen.
###169 You can get mad and throw the experiment on the floor
###172 if you don't follow the rules.
###175 So if a person wants to be more analytical
###179 they have to learn how to say "I don't know"
###182 or "Up to now, everything seems to be OK.
###188 My relationship seems to work out in many different areas
###192 or more areas than I expected."
###195 Sometimes we're pleasantly surprised
###198 by the reaction of people we had a negative view of.
###203 I may have a negative view of you
###206 but in time, observing what you do
###210 my negative view becomes a positive view.
###212 But if I have a negative view, it means I was projecting.
###216 I really don't know. So the point is
###220 when events occur that are tough
###223 if a person deserts you at that time
###226 you'll understand that they can't live under those conditions.
###230 They're not bad people. They revert back to their conditioning.
###235 Now, "reverting back to their conditioning" means
###239 if the world is catastrophic
###242 if a man is shot, he's laying in the battlefield
###246 he says "I hope the first-aid people come soon. I don't feel very good."
###251 If they don't come soon, he says "Where the hell are they?"
###257 He expected them to come sooner
###259 but they come as soon as they can come, whenever that is.
###264 And if you can't take it, you can swear all you want to
###268 but if you continue to swear and continue to get angry
###272 they're apt to arrive during that period.
###276 And you say "Well, it's my prayers
###279 because I hoped they'd come and rescue me.
###284 That goes for...
###286 H.G. Wells had a scene in the movie
###289 I think it was called "The Shape of Things to Come"
###292 in which a pilot shot down a German pilot or another pilot
###297 and he went over to the plane crash
###300 and the guy was very ill.
###304 He couldn't leave. He says "The plane is going to explode
###307 and I'm badly damaged. So
###311 this guy gave him a gun to shoot himself.
###314 In the motion picture "Airmail"
###317 there was a guy caught in an airplane. [He] couldn't get out. [It] was burning
###322 so the guy shot him twice. The guy loved him
###325 but he didn't want him to burn to death.
###329 Is that murder? What is it?
###332 If anybody claimed he was suffering so much from cancer
###335 I shot him. Is that love?
###339 How do you talk about love?
###342 Do you know what I mean? If a person is suffering from cancer
###345 he says "Please, take my life.
###348 The doctor says "I can live three months with this condition."
###351 And you hear him crying out, suffering
###354 and you shoot him. Are you a murderer? Are you kind?
###359 All those words are very difficult to deal with.
###362 It depends on the situation.
###364 It depends on how attached you are to the person.
###367 If you don't give a damn about their suffering. You know what I mean?
###371 So people begged certain doctors to take their lives.
###376 They were suffering too much. It was too much on their family.
###380 They didn't have a bank account to pay for this medical condition
###385 that they were under. They said "Please, end my life
###388 because the pain is unbearable."
###391 And the Bible says you're not supposed to take a life
###395 no matter what the pain is.
###397 That's your entry into heaven, especially in India.
###402 If a person's suffering a great deal, they're paying off their karma.
###407 If you end that, you shoot them, they can't pay off their karma.
###412 So, you've got all these crazy things
###415 that you are exposed to
###418 and you use your logic, thinking that it makes sense.
###422 It only makes sense if a person says "I see your point
###426 but I'm unable to accept it emotionally."
###430 There are people like that, that can't do that.
###433 They can't shoot their father, even though he's suffering
###436 because it says "Thou shalt not kill"
###439 and they figure that even if they shot their father that was suffering
###442 they've committed a crime against God.
###446 So remember, it's your own expectations that hurt you
###451 not the world you live in. Whatever happens in the world is real.
###456 What you think should happen is unreal.
###460 So people are hurt by their expectations.
###463 Any questions about that?
###468 If you have reasonable expectations such as "I don't know"
###473 then whatever happens, you say "I didn't think it would be that bad."
###478 How do you know how bad it would be?
###480 Whatever happens, no matter how bad it is
###483 if fifty kids are killed in a bus crash
###486 that's a problem. Why were they killed?
###489 The bus slipped off an icy highway. What can you do about it?
###494 I don't know. And the condition will prevail
###498 unless you come up with a new way of friction tires
###503 that can't skid on icy highways.
###507 That's the best you can do. But if you made those tires
###510 and you put them on the bus, and the bus still slipped
###514 it means you got more to go.
###516 You can't say "I made ice tires that won't slip."
###520 That's a projection, unless you tested it out many times.
###525 Do you understand?
###527 So what does man really want?
###530 He really wants accurate predictability.
###534 You cannot achieve that unless you're technical.
###537 ...accurate predictability.
###540 If an engine fails it means
###542 there's something wrong with a fuel pump, or any number of things.
###546 If you can't attend to those things
###549 then the probability is that at some time or other
###553 the engine will fail.
###557 Now, I don't expect you to walk around accepting everything that happens.
###561 I expect you to be angered and say "What can I do about it?
###566 I don't know, but I'm going to try. I'm going to try to make it possible
###572 for people not to be injured.
###574 I'm going to try to design a conveyor
###577 that's on the tracks and under the tracks, that's locked
###581 so even in an amusement park
###584 the loop-da-loop can't go off the tracks
###587 because it's got under-braces."
###590 The under-braces may be perfect
###592 but the structure of the unit may not be.
###595 So, to the ability of an individual
###600 to handle all those things is very difficult
###604 but he only knows, or she only knows, what to handle after the event.
###612 The event has to occur first, then the person makes a safety device
###617 and he solved that problem, but there may be other problems
###621 and another event may occur that's negative.
###624 And the person says "What can I do about it?
###626 I don't know enough about it. I'm going to read up on it
###630 and try to become familiar with the nature of the problem
###633 and try to solve it" and
###636 when a person says to you "Have you solved it?
###640 This is the device. I made in an attempt to solve it.
###643 Will it work? Well, according to the tests I did, it will."
###648 But in reality, it was cold and the oil didn't flow
###653 so the thing wasn't lubricated, and it didn't work.
###656 There are other factors you learned about later on.
###660 That's called "after the facts".
###663 So some people get mad at technicians and say
###666 "You're a technician. Why did that thing fail?" "What do you suggest?"
###671 is what you put to that person.
###674 If they say "You designed that unit and it failed."
###678 "Yes it did fail, apparently I didn't know enough about
###682 solving that problem. What do you suggest?
###685 Don't get mad at me. What do you suggest?
###687 You've done nothing but expect me to solve the problem."
