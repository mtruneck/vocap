###1 MALE SPEAKER: Welcome, everybody.
###3 Six days ago, astronaut Mark Whatrey--
###7 ANDY WEIR: Watney.
###8 MALE SPEAKER: --became one of the first men
###10 to walk on the surface of Mars.
###12 Now he may be the first man to die there.
###16 Will he?
###18 Andy Weir's brilliant debut novel, "The Martian,"
###22 is a gripping story of survival against all odds.
###26 The astronaut is stranded millions of miles
###29 from the nearest human being with no way
###32 to even signal Earth that he is alive.
###35 And even if you he could get word out,
###37 his food would be gone years before a rescue mission could
###40 arrive.
###43 Andy Weir, he's our neighbor here in Mountain View,
###46 a longtime programmer.
###48 He got his first job at 15 years of age at Sandia National Labs.
###53 He wrote code for Warcraft II.
###58 And he's now working at MobileIron,
###61 where he's working on Android codes.
###64 And actually, we talked a little bit how he likes the platform,
###68 and he didn't have too many complaints.
###72 I guess this is kudos to you guys from the Android group.
###76 I am pleased to present the book, "The Martian."
###83 Andy will be talking to us today about it
###85 and showing some of the technical details that
###89 went into the book.
###90 And please give a warm welcome.
###91 [APPLAUSE]
###98 ANDY WEIR: So, like he said, I'm Andy Weir.
###100 And I wrote "The Martian."
###101 I'm going to be talking to you about that today.
###105 When they told me that I'd be doing a Google Talk,
###107 they said, you're going to want to make
###108 about 40 minutes of content.
###110 I don't think I'm going to make 40 minutes of content.
###113 But I'll just say what I have to say until I'm out of stuff
###116 to say, and then I'll take questions.
###120 So you just got the summary of the book.
###122 But I'm going to do a reading.
###123 I'm going to start us off with a reading.
###124 And then I'm going to start talking about some
###125 of the technical stuff that went into making the book.
###128 The reading's going to be about 10 minutes.
###131 And it's just the first chapter.
###134 So it's about four or five pages.
###137 Also, the reading will include profanities.
###140 I hope nobody's bothered by that.
###141 I don't see any children out there.
###143 So I'm just going to jump right in.
###147 Log entry, Sol 6.
###149 I'm pretty much fucked.
###151 That's my considered opinion.
###152 Fucked.
###153 Six days into what should be the greatest two months of my life,
###155 and it's turned into a nightmare.
###157 I don't even know who'll read this.
###158 I guess someone will find it eventually,
###160 maybe 100 years from now.
###161 For the record, I didn't die on Sol 6.
###163 Certainly the rest of the crew thought I did.
###165 And I can't blame them.
###166 Maybe there'll be a day of national mourning for me.
###168 And my Wikipedia page will say Mark Watney
###170 is the only human being to have died on Mars.
###172 And it'll be right, probably.
###173 Because I'll surely die here.
###175 Just not on Sol 6 when everyone thinks I did.
###177 Let's see.
###178 Where do I begin?
###179 The Ares program-- mankind reaching out to Mars
###182 to send people to another planet for the very first time
###184 and expand the horizons of humanity, blah, blah, blah.
###186 The Ares 1 crew did their thing and came back heroes.
###189 They got the parades and fame and love of the world.
###191 Ares 2 did the same thing in a different location on Mars.
###193 They got a firm handshake and a hot cup of coffee
###196 when they got home.
###197 Ares 3?
###198 Well, that's my mission.
###199 Well, not mine, per se.
###200 Commander Lewis was in charge.
###201 I was just one of her crew.
###203 Actually, I was the very lowest ranked member of the crew.
###205 I would only be in command of the mission
###207 if I were the only remaining person.
###208 Hey, what do you know?
###209 I'm in command.
###211 I wonder if this log'll be recovered
###212 before the rest of the crew die of old age.
###214 I presume they got back to Earth all right.
###216 Guys, if you're reading this, it wasn't your fault.
###218 You did what you had to do.
###219 In your position, I would have done the same thing.
###221 I don't blame you.
###222 And I'm glad you survived.
###223 
###225 I guess I should explain how Mars missions work
###227 for any laymen who may be reading this.
###229 We got to Earth orbit the normal way through an ordinary ship
###232 to "Hermes."
###232 All the Ares missions use "Hermes"
###234 to get to and from Mars.
###235 It's really big and it cost a lot, so NASA only built one.
###238 Once we got to "Hermes," four additional unmanned missions
###241 brought us fuel and supplies while we prepared for our trip.
###243 Once everything was a "go," we set out for Mars,
###245 but not very fast.
###246 Gone are the days of heavy chemical fuel
###248 burns and trans-Mars injection orbits.
###250 "Hermes" is powered by ion engines.
###251 They throw argon out the back of the ship
###253 really fast to get a tiny amount of acceleration.
###255 The thing is it doesn't take much reactant mass.
###258 So a little argon and a nuclear reactor to power things
###260 let us accelerate constantly the whole way there.
###263 You'd be amazed how fast you can get
###264 going with a tiny acceleration over a long time.
###267 I could regale you with tales of how we had great fun
###269 on the trip, but I won't.
###271 I don't feel like re-living it right now.
###272 Suffice it to say we got to Mars 124 days
###275 later without strangling each other.
###276 From there we took the MDV, Mars Descent Vehicle,
###279 to the surface.
###280 The MDV is basically a big can with some light thrusters
###282 and parachutes attached.
###284 Its sole purpose is to get six humans from Mars orbit
###286 to the surface without killing any of them.
###288 And now we come to the real trick of Mars exploration--
###290 having all your shit there in advance.
###292 A total of 14 unmanned missions deposited everything
###294 we would need for surface operations.
###296 They tried their best to land on the supply
###298 vessels in the same general area and did a reasonably good job.
###300 Supplies aren't nearly so fragile as humans
###302 and can hit the ground really hard,
###304 but they tend to bounce around a lot.
###305 Naturally they didn't send us to Mars
###307 until they confirmed that all the supplies had made it
###309 to the surface and their containers weren't breached.
###311 Start to finish, including supply missions,
###313 a Mars mission takes about three years.
###315 In fact, there were Ares 3 supplies en route to Mars
###317 while the Ares 2 crew were on their way home.
###320 The most important piece of the advance supplies, of course,
###322 was the MAV, the Mars Ascent Vehicle.
###325 That's how we would get back to "Hermes"
###326 after surface operations were complete.
###328 The MAV was soft landed as opposed to the balloon
###331 bounce fest the other supplies had.
###332 Of course, it was in constant communication with Houston,
###335 and if there had been any problems with it,
###336 we would have passed by Mars and gone home without ever landing.
###339 The MAV is pretty cool.
###341 It turns out through a neat set of chemical reactions
###342 with the Martian atmosphere, for every kilogram of hydrogen
###345 you bring to Mars, you can make 13 kilograms of fuel.
###348 It's a slow process, though.
###349 It takes 24 months to fill the tank.
###351 That's why they sent it long before we got there.
###353 You can imagine how disappointed I
###354 was when I discovered the MAV was gone.
###357 It was a ridiculous sequence of events that led to me
###359 almost dying, and an even more ridiculous sequence that
###361 led to me surviving.
###362 The mission is designed to handle
###364 sandstorm gusts of up to 150 KPH.
###366 So Houston got understandably nervous
###368 when we got whacked with 175 KPH winds.
###370 We all got in our flight suits and huddled
###372 in the middle of the Hab just in case it lost pressure.
###374 But they Hab wasn't the problem.
###376 The MAV is a spaceship.
###377 It has a lot of delicate parts.
###378 It can put up with storms to a certain extent,
###380 but it can't just get sand blasted forever.
###382 After an hour and a half of sustained wind,
###384 NASA gave the order to abort.
###385 Nobody wanted to stop a month-long mission after only
###387 six days, but if the MAV took any more punishment,
###389 we'd have all gotten stranded down there.
###392 We had to go out in the storm to get from the Hab to the MAV.
###394 And that was going to be risky.
###396 But what choice did we have?
###397 Everyone made it but me.
###399 Our main communications dish, which relayed signals
###401 from the Hab to "Hermes," acted like a parachute getting
###403 torn from its foundation and carried with the torrent.
###405 Along the way, it crashed through the reception antenna
###407 array.
###408 Then one of those long, thin antennae
###409 slammed into me end first.
###411 It tore through my suit like a bullet through butter.
###413 And I felt the worst pain in my life as it ripped open my side.
###416 I vaguely remember having the wind knocked out
###418 of me-- pulled out of me, really--
###419 and my ears popping painfully is the pressure
###421 in my suit escaped.
###422 The last thing I remember was seeing Johanssen
###424 hopelessly reaching out toward me.
###426 I awoke to an oxygen alarm in my suit,
###428 a steady obnoxious beeping that aroused me
###430 from a deep and profound desire to just fucking die.
###434 The storm had abated.
###435 I was face down, almost totally buried in sand.
###437 As I groggily came to, I wondered
###439 why I wasn't more dead.
###441 The antenna had enough force to punch
###442 through the suit and my side, but it
###444 had been stopped by my pelvis.
###445 So there was only one hole in the suit--
###446 and a hole in me, of course.
###449 I'd been knocked back quite a ways
###450 and rolled down a steep hill.
###452 Somehow I landed face down, which
###453 forced the antenna into a strongly oblique angle that
###455 put a lot of torque on the hole in the suit.
###457 It made a weak seal.
###458 Then the copious blood from my wound
###460 trickled down toward the hole.
###461 As the blood reached the site of the breach, the water in it
###463 quickly evaporated from the air flow and low pressure,
###465 leaving a gunky residue behind.
###467 More blood came in behind it and was also reduced to gunk.
###469 Eventually it sealed the gaps around the hole
###471 and reduced the leak to something
###472 the suit could counteract.
###474 The suit did its job admirably.
###476 Sensing the drop in pressure, it constantly
###478 flooded itself with air from my nitrogen tank to equalize.
###480 Once the leak became manageable, it only
###482 had to trickle new air in slowly to relieve the air lost.
###485 After a while, the CO2, carbon dioxide, absorbers in the suit
###487 were expended That's really the limiting factor to life
###490 support-- not the amount of oxygen you bring with you,
###492 but the amount of CO2 you can remove.
###494 In the Hab, I have the oxygenator, a large piece
###496 of equipment that breaks apart CO2 to give the oxygen back.
###500 But the space suits have to be portable.
###501 So they use a simple chemical absorption
###503 process with expendable filters.
###505 I'd been asleep long enough that my filters were useless.
###508 The suit saw this problem and moved into an emergency mode
###510 the engineers call "bloodletting."
###512 Having no way to separate the CO2,
###513 the suit deliberately vented air into the Martian atmosphere,
###516 then back-filled with nitrogen.
###517 Between the breach and the bloodletting,
###519 it quickly ran out of nitrogen.
###520 All it had left was my oxygen tank.
###522 So it did the only thing it could to keep me alive.
###524 It started back-filling with pure oxygen.
###526 I now risked dying from oxygen toxicity
###529 as the excessively high amount of oxygen
###530 threatened to burn up my nervous system, lungs, and eyes--
###533 an ironic death for someone with a leaky space suit, too much
###535 oxygen.
###536 Every step of the way would have had beeping alarms, alerts,
###539 and warnings.
###539 But it was a high oxygen morning that woke me.
###542 The sheer volume of training for a space mission is astounding.
###544 I'd spent a week back on Earth practicing emergency spacesuit
###547 drills.
###547 I knew what to do.
###548 Carefully reaching the side of my helmet,
###550 I got the breach kit.
###551 It's nothing more than a funnel with a valve at the small end
###553 and an unbelievably sticky resin on the white end.
###555 The idea is you have the valve open and stick
###558 the white end over the hole.
###559 The air can escape through the valve
###560 so it doesn't interfere with the resin making a good seal.
###562 Then you close the valve, and you've sealed the breach.
###564 The tricky part was getting the antenna out of the way.
###566 I pulled it out as fast as I could,
###568 wincing as the sudden pressure drop dizzied me and made
###570 the wound in my side scream in agony.
###572 I got the breach kit over the hole and sealed it.
###574 It held.
###575 The suit back-filled the missing air with yet more oxygen.
###577 Checking my arm readouts, I saw the suit was now at 85% oxygen.
###581 For reference, Earth's atmosphere is about 21%.
###583 I'd be OK so long as I didn't spend too much time like that.
###586 I stumbled up the hill back to the Hab.
###588 As I crested the rise, I saw something
###589 that made me very happy and something
###591 that made me very sad.
###592 The Hab was intact.
###593 Yay!
###593 And the MAV was gone.
###595 Boo!
###595 
###598 Right at that moment, I knew I was screwed.
###600 But I didn't want to just die out on the surface.
###602 I limped back to the Hab and fumbled my way out
###604 into an airlock.
###605 As soon as it equalized, I threw off my helmet.
###607 Once inside the Hab, I doffed the suit
###609 and got my first good look at the injury.
###610 It would need stitches.
###611 Fortunately, all of us had been trained
###613 in basic medical procedures and the Hab
###616 had excellent medical supplies.
###617 A quick shot of a local anesthetic, irrigate the wound,
###620 nine stitches, and I was done.
###621 I'd be taking antibiotics for a couple of weeks,
###623 but other than that I'd be fine.
###624 I knew it was hopeless, but I tried firing
###626 up the communications array.
###627 No signal, of course.
###628 The primary satellite dish had broken off, remember?
###630 And it took the reception antennae with it.
###633 The Hab had secondary and tertiary communication systems,
###635 but they were both just for talking
###637 to the MAV, which would use it's much more powerful systems
###639 to relay to "Hermes."
###640 The thing is, that only works if the MAV is still around.
###643 I had no way to talk to "Hermes."
###644 In time, I could locate the dish on the surface,
###646 but it would take weeks for me to rig up any repairs
###648 and that would be too late.
###649 In an abort, "Hermes" would leave within 24 hours.
###652 The orbital dynamics made the trip safer and shorter
###654 the earlier you left.
###655 So why wait?
###656 Checking out my suit, I saw the antenna
###658 had plowed through my biomonitor computer.
###659 When on an EVA, all the crew's suits
###661 are networked so we can see each other's status.
###663 The rest of the crew would have seen the pressure in my suit
###665 drop to nearly zero followed immediately
###667 by my biosigns going flat.
###669 Add to that, watching me tumble down a hill with a spear
###671 threw me in the middle of a sandstorm?
###673 Yeah, they thought I was dead.
###674 How could they not?
###676 They may have even had a brief discussion
###677 about recovering my body, but regulations were clear.
###680 In the event a crewman dies on Mars, he stays on Mars.
###682 Leaving his body behind reduces weight for the MAV on the trip
###685 back.
###685 That means more disposable fuel and a larger margin
###687 of error for the return thrust.
###689 No point in giving that up for sentimentality.
###691 So that's the situation.
###692 I'm stranded on Mars.
###693 I have no way to communicate with "Hermes" or Earth.
###695 Everyone thinks I'm dead.
###696 I'm in a Hab designed to last 31 days.
###698 If the oxygenator breaks down, I'll suffocate.
###700 If the water reclaimer breaks down, I'll die of thirst.
###703 If the Hab breaches, I'll just kind of explode.
###705 If none of those things happen, I'll
###706 eventually run out of food and starve to death.
###708 So yeah, I'm fucked.
###709 [LAUGHTER]
###710 [APPLAUSE]
###716 So that's chapter one.
###717 
###719 Of the things that was really important to me
###721 in writing this was I wanted everything
###723 to be as scientifically accurate as possible.
###725 So for starters, all the technology
###727 mentioned in the book is real.
###730 It takes place in a slight future,
###732 so some of the technology is much more efficient or much
###735 more effective than the versions of it we have now.
###738 But it all actually exists.
###740 And what I'm going to talk to you today
###742 about-- being a Google crowd, I thought
###744 you might be interested in some software I wrote
###746 to make one part of it as accurate as possible.
###749 It has to do with the way that "Hermes" got from Earth to Mars
###752 and back.
###754 "Hermes" is an ion engine ship.
###756 And for those of you who don't know what ion engines are--
###758 I mean, I described it briefly in the chapter--
###761 but basically, instead of a chemical propellant
###763 going out the back of the ship providing
###765 a large amount of impulse, it's a very small amount
###768 of acceleration caused by magnetic fields
###770 throwing ions out the back of the ship.
###772 Now the benefit to this is that you
###774 can have much, much, much less reactant mass.
###777 And I believe-- and this is just my own subjective opinion--
###779 we have to improve on the technology that we have
###783 and just keep working that.
###784 I think that's the only way we'll
###785 be able to send humans long distances out into space.
###789 The amount of chemical propellant
###792 you would need to send something big enough
###794 to support humans for several months out to Mars
###797 would just be huge, huge.
###799 I mean, you'd be putting millions and millions
###801 of kilograms of just fuel into space to do this.
###804 So you need to minimize how much you
###807 launch from Earth to make that efficient.
###809 So that means for "Hermes," I decided, oh, OK,
###812 so it's got a slow constant acceleration from ion engines.
###815 It's got a nuclear reactor aboard
###816 to create the energy necessary to throw the particles.
###819 And so that means I needed to figure out how it gets there.
###824 And it turns out for a point acceleration, when you just
###827 say, oh, I want to go on a transfer orbit from here
###830 to here.
###831 And then there'll be a point thrust here,
###832 and then another point thrust here
###834 to match Mars, boom, that's how we do it.
###836 It's very simple.
###837 Well, I mean, for a dork like me who
###839 likes orbital dynamics, that's very simple.
###842 With a constantly accelerating ship, that's very hard.
###845 I could not wrap my head around the math.
###847 I couldn't find anybody who could
###848 wrap their heads around the math.
###849 And what I found out by doing further research
###852 is NASA does this by computer simulation.
###854 So that's what I did.
###855 
###858 I wrote this program called Orbits.
###861 I don't how well that's showing up.
###862 Let me take a look.
###863 Are you able to see?
###864 Yeah, you can kind of see.
###866 It's a little darker than I'd like.
###867 But this-- well, I've got a mouse-- this circle here,
###873 this red circle, is Mars' orbit.
###875 The blue circle is Earth's orbit.
###877 And the gray line is the course of the ship.
###880 So the way this works is I can mess around with the vector
###884 that the ship is presenting with respect to the sun.
###888 So in other words, if I were to point it directly away
###891 from the sun, then I can show where that vector's
###895 going to be anywhere along the trip.
###896 You see how it's always pointed away from the sun?
###898 The red vector that's following the mouse?
###901 That's how this works.
###902 And so I can do something like this.
###905 I can point it-- well, directly toward the sun
###907 leads to your immediate death.
###908 But point it, say, perpendicular to the sun,
###911 you can see it's just always trying
###912 to go perpendicular to the sun.
###914 So what I wanted to do here is, say,
###916 this is the start point of Earth.
###917 And as you see, if I move along, it
###919 shows me where Earth and Mars will
###921 be as they're going along in their orbits
###924 from my chosen launch window.
###928 And then the idea is to try to find a way
###931 to make this get to Mars with course changes and stuff
###938 and work that out.
###941 This would not be a successful trip.
###945 But after all a whole bunch of work and just fiddling around
###948 with it, I managed to figure out this path that actually starts
###952 here, then intercepts Mars, and then
###956 doesn't do any thrusting or anything for a while.
###958 It's just at Mars.
###960 And then comes back to Earth.
###962 I also set up this app to animate.
###964 So I can just press Space, and you can watch it happen.
###968 There it goes to Mars, hangs out there
###970 for their planned 31-day mission,
###973 and then comes back to Earth like that.
###977 AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] a year.
###978 ANDY WEIR: It takes a little bit more than a year.
###981 I don't know if you can read it up in the corner.
###983 Mission day 396 is when it completes.
###987 Now, then, as I mentioned in the book,
###990 they had to abort after only six days on Mars due to the storm.
###995 And I mentioned, the orbital dynamics
###997 make it cheaper the earlier you leave.
###999 And this is why.
###1000 Because if you leave earlier, you
###1003 can take a slightly different course
###1005 and get back to Earth earlier.
###1007 And that's, of course, what anybody would want.
###1009 Any NASA mission designer worth their salt
###1012 would want to do something like this.
###1014 Another thing I did was-- it came up
###1018 a lot in the story-- I wanted the transmission
###1021 times to be accurate.
###1022 So when later on in the story they're talking to the ship,
###1025 they're talking to Mars, Mars is talking to Earth,
###1029 all these entities are communicating,
###1031 and I wanted to know what the transmission time would be.
###1033 So I set it up so that wherever the ship is--
###1036 I can just move the mouse around and wherever
###1040 I'm pointing on that-- it'll tell you what mission day it is
###1043 and what the current distances are
###1044 between Earth and Mars, Earth and "Hermes,"
###1046 and "Hermes" and Mars.
###1047 Those are those three numbers up top, and the light transmission
###1050 time between them so that I could
###1052 have that be accurate in the story, too.
###1056 So I'm going to give a little bit of a spoiler here.
###1058 The final path that "Hermes" ends up taking is this.
###1062 
###1065 And so--
###1066 AUDIENCE: It looks like the other one.
###1068 
###1070 ANDY WEIR: So I am giving a bit of a spoiler,
###1072 but basically they have to go back to Mars.
###1074 And so I'll describe what happens as it's happening.
###1079 Here they go.
###1080 They're going to Mars.
###1081 After six Sols, they have to abort.
###1083 So they're headed back to Earth.
###1086 They need to go back to Mars.
###1087 Boom, sling shot off of Earth, back around the sun.
###1090 And now they need to do a flyby of Mars.
###1093 So they're not going into orbit, they're
###1094 just-- doink-- doing a flyby.
###1096 And then we got to get back to Earth.
###1099 
###1104 So that was a lot of work to figure that out.
###1109 And this is all done within this simulation,
###1111 this ship "Hermes," has a total constant acceleration
###1114 of the two millimeters per second per second.
###1117 That's it.
###1118 That's all it gets.
###1119 So yeah, after five seconds of doing that,
###1122 it would be moving one centimeter per second.
###1126 So that's the software I wrote that I wanted to show off.
###1130 I thought the Google crowd would like to see how that works.
###1136 And that's about it, actually.
###1137 That's all I really had to show you.
###1140 I was going to do the reading.
###1141 What are we at here?
###1142 Oh, 20 minutes in.
###1143 
###1146 AUDIENCE: I really like that.
###1147 So that's great.
###1149 And it seems beyond what you had to do.
###1153 Are the orbits elliptical?
###1156 And could they be skewed?
###1158 ANDY WEIR: Those are the actual orbits of Earth and Mars
###1160 correctly oriented.
###1162 And the launch window-- I won't tell you
###1163 the date because I may have a contest someday to have people
###1166 figure out the launch date from the information in the book--
###1170 but it is based on a real-world date.
###1172 And to be thorough, the book tells you
###1178 what day everything is on.
###1179 So it's like, log entry, Sol 6.
###1181 Log entry, Sol 27.
###1183 Log entry, Sol 412.
###1184 Whatever.
###1185 So it's actually very time specific, just
###1188 the narrative style it has.
###1190 And so I made sure that I knew the actual real-world date
###1193 for each-- on any given day in the book, what
###1196 the real-world date is so that I could mention things like, oh,
###1199 by the way, today's Christmas.
###1201 And it is.
###1202 There were sometimes I had to keep myself
###1205 from over clever-ing things.
###1207 There was one kind of major plot point that happened.
###1209 And I'm looking at my spreadsheet.
###1211 And I'm like, oh, this happens to be on Valentine's Day.
###1213 I should mention that.
###1214 But it would just seem stupid to the reader.
###1216 It would be like out of nowhere someone's like, by the way,
###1218 it's Valentine's Day.
###1220 It's like, no, that's just dumb.
###1222 The trickiest part in this was I did all sorts of math.
###1225 I checked all my physics, math, science, everything.
###1228 And the hard part was not bragging to the reader.
###1232 It was not showing my work and trying to go, look at me.
###1234 I'm so cool.
###1235 I just needed to keep the story moving along.
###1237 And I wanted it to be accurate.
###1238 That's all.
###1239 AUDIENCE: So I read the book about a year ago.
###1241 What I enjoyed the most about it were
###1243 two things about the character.
###1245 One was how resourceful he is.
###1247 He always figures out how to get out of his situation.
###1250 The other was his attitude.
###1252 He's cut off.
###1253 He has so many setbacks.
###1254 And he always keeps his head up.
###1256 I was wondering, was there anything
###1257 that inspired you to make a character like that?
###1259 Or was there any kind of message you're
###1261 trying to send to make somebody so resourceful and so
###1263 optimistic in such a bad situation?
###1266 ANDY WEIR: Well, I mean, I tried to make
###1269 it a pretty upbeat book.
###1270 It could've been really dark and depressing, right?
###1272 It's like the guys trapped alone.
###1274 He could be just having this crippling psychological
###1276 problems of loneliness and all these other things
###1279 that most people would face.
###1280 I figure I can buy my way out of that
###1283 by saying he's an astronaut.
###1284 Astronauts are a cut above.
###1286 And so he doesn't sink into depression.
###1288 He just goes into problem-solving mode.
###1290 And I made him this really flippant, smart-ass personality
###1293 because I had to tell a whole story.
###1296 If I'd done just blank narration, just
###1300 omniscient narration even, it would have just seemed
###1303 like a technical manual or a really dry sequence of events.
###1307 I needed something in the narration itself
###1309 that would keep the user interested.
###1311 And so having it told by a self-effacing smart-ass seemed
###1314 liked a good idea.
###1315 AUDIENCE: So I'm thinking about buying this book.
###1317 ANDY WEIR: $10 right over there.
###1319 AUDIENCE: How do you think I should buy it?
###1320 ANDY WEIR: I think you should buy one for all your friends.
###1320 AUDIENCE: It's $10 right over there,
###1322 but there's also a lot of digital distribution
###1325 around these days.
###1326 Do you have thoughts as an author about that?
###1329 And what works best for you?
###1330 What do you like as a reader?
###1332 And what do you think about ebooks in general as an author?
###1335 ANDY WEIR: Well, ebooks are how I got into the industry,
###1337 so I'm extremely grateful.
###1339 I think they're great.
###1341 And as for buying a physical book or an ebook,
###1344 that's a matter of personal choice.
###1346 I still read physical books, but that's
###1348 just because I'm kind of a Luddite.
###1350 Eventually, I will get a proper e-reader.
###1353 And then I'll probably be hooked on that from then on.
###1356 
###1358 For those of you who don't know, "The Martian"
###1360 was originally just a serial story
###1362 that I was posting to my website just
###1364 as a hobby doing in my spare time.
###1366 And then I finished and some people
###1369 said, hey, I don't like reading this on web pages.
###1371 Can you put it up in an ebook format?
###1374 And so I'm like, OK.
###1375 So I made an EPUB and MOBI version.
###1376 And I posted them on the website and said, there.
###1378 There you go.
###1379 Free download, knock yourself out.
###1380 And then some people were like, well,
###1382 I'm not really technically savvy.
###1384 And I don't know how to get an ebook downloaded
###1387 from the internet onto my Kindle.
###1389 Is there a way you can just put it up on Kindle?
###1392 And so I looked into it.
###1393 And anybody can post their stuff onto Kindle.
###1396 Which is important-- remember that-- because anybody
###1398 who wants to be a writer, you just can.
###1400 You can just write your story, post it on Kindle.
###1404 All they do is they check to make
###1405 sure there's nothing illegal or really, really evil about what
###1408 you're posting.
###1410 And so I posted it up on Kindle.
###1414 But Amazon is not a charity.
###1416 They're in this to make money.
###1417 They have a minimum price that you're
###1419 allowed to charge, which is $0.99,
###1421 or at least it was at the time.
###1423 And so I said, OK, I'll set the price at $0.99.
###1426 I'm not allowed to charge less.
###1427 And I told everybody, hey, here it is.
###1429 It's $0.99 because I can't charge less than that.
###1431 Just look at it this way.
###1432 If you want to pay $1 to have it conveniently
###1434 delivered to your Kindle, that's what you're paying for.
###1437 I got $0.30 or something out of that per copy.
###1441 I mean, I was not doing this for the money.
###1443 And then that's when I learned how deep
###1447 Amazon's reach into the readership market is.
###1451 Many, many, many more people-- many multiples more people--
###1455 bought it from Amazon than downloaded it for free
###1458 from my site.
###1459 
###1461 AUDIENCE: Such a deal.
###1462 ANDY WEIR: Such a deal.
###1463 I'm like, OK.
###1465 And that caused it to start making
###1468 its way up the top sellers charts.
###1470 And then once it got into the top 10 on sci-fi,
###1473 then it started to really sell.
###1474 Because of course, people are like, I want a sci-fi.
###1476 What's in the top 10?
###1478 So once you break into that list,
###1480 your sales go really well.
###1483 And it sold well enough that it got
###1484 the attention of a guy named Julian Pavia at Random
###1488 House, who was an editor there.
###1490 And he said, I like this book.
###1491 I think I want to talk to this reader and offer a print deal.
###1494 But first I'm going to run it by a colleague of mine,
###1496 a guy named David Fugate, who is a literary agent.
###1498 He said, hey, why don't you read this book,
###1500 tell me what you think, and do you
###1501 think I should offer this guy a print deal?
###1503 David read it and said, I think it's good.
###1506 I think you should offer him a print deal.
###1508 Now hang on a second.
###1509 I'm going to go become his agent.
###1510 
###1513 So he did.
###1514 And then he turned around and said,
###1515 so Julian, let's talk money.
###1518 So that was pretty cool.
###1520 So my whole experience with publishing
###1523 has been completely backwards.
###1526 I wrote what I intended to be just a free thing
###1530 and then got forced to charge for it.
###1532 And then an agent came knocking at my door.
###1533 And then a publisher came offering me a contract.
###1536 And I did nothing to promote it ever, by the way.
###1538 All I ever did was just post it.
###1540 I didn't even try to go to forums
###1543 or do events or anything to get people to read it.
###1545 It just spread by word of mouth.
###1547 So the long-ass winded answer to your question
###1552 is I'm a big fan of digital books because that made me.
###1558 Sorry, one last addendum-- and it can make anyone.
###1561 That's what I think is awesome, is
###1563 it's become a pure meritocracy.
###1565 It used to be sort of an old-boy network.
###1567 You had to know somebody to get into the publishing industry
###1570 at all.
###1571 Or you had to dedicate your life to doing scutt work
###1574 and working your way up through journalism
###1576 until someone would take you seriously enough
###1578 even to consider reading your book at a publishing house.
###1581 But now you can post it yourself with no intervening steps
###1583 and, if it's good, people will buy it.
###1586 AUDIENCE: So your ion drive, is the reaction mass just small
###1592 enough so that you don't account for the change
###1595 in how much acceleration it can give?
###1597 ANDY WEIR: I cheated.
###1598 The answer is it wouldn't quite be.
###1601 It wouldn't quite be.
###1602 And the simulation could have accounted for it
###1604 since it's doing incremental-- every step,
###1606 I think I had it do it in one-hour segments
###1608 to run the simulation forward.
###1610 And so I could have accounted for the mass loss.
###1612 It is very small.
###1614 It's on the order of-- I can't remember exactly-- it
###1617 was on the order of 10% of the ship's mass, though.
###1620 Normally if you were going to do--
###1623 to get to Mars using a Hohmann transfer,
###1625 it would take five kilometers per second delta
###1629 V, which would be for a ship like this
###1632 that I later defined as being 110,000 kilograms,
###1635 would be millions and millions of kilograms of fuel.
###1637 I mean, the vast majority of the starting mass would be fuel.
###1641 And so once I checked the specific impulse
###1644 of ion engines, it's so much better
###1646 than I just said, eh, I'll approximate it out.
###1649 AUDIENCE: In talking about how to read the book,
###1651 I wanted to put in a plug for the audio book, which
###1653 I listened to.
###1655 It's a great way to experience it.
###1656 I think you got a really wonderful narrator.
###1658 ANDY WEIR: Yeah, the narrator's name is RC Bray.
###1661 And he's a veteran narrator.
###1662 He's done over 100 books, I think.
###1666 And he's got a really good voice.
###1667 And he puts a lot of feeling into it.
###1670 And since this is first-person, you
###1671 can kind of feel, OK, this is Mark's voice, basically.
###1674 AUDIENCE: The one thing I wanted to ask about that was there
###1677 are a couple of technical terms that he, let's say,
###1680 mispronounces that--
###1681 ANDY WEIR: Yep, yep.
###1682 AUDIENCE: --kind of take you out of the story for a moment.
###1683 ANDY WEIR: What?
###1683 You don't know about the ASC2 standard?
###1685 AUDIENCE: Yeah, the ASC2 standard is the best one.
###1687 ANDY WEIR: ASC2.
###1689 Yep.
###1692 AUDIENCE: But you get past that.
###1694 ANDY WEIR: Well, so what I wanted to do, actually,
###1696 was make my own mapping standard for letters to numbers.
###1701 And I was going to call it ASC.
###1703 And then I'd make an improved version and call it ASC2.
###1706 And that way I'd retroactively be correct.
###1708 No, yeah, he messed that up.
###1711 Which is funny because they called me
###1713 for a bunch of pronunciations on, OK, what is this?
###1716 And how's it pronounced?
###1717 How do people say this?
###1718 But nobody ever asked me how to pronounce ASCII.
###1723 They are making a new version of it,
###1725 which I'm not sure if it's out yet.
###1727 But they're re-recording it from scratch
###1729 because there were a lot of edits and changes
###1731 between the original Kindle version
###1733 and what's releasing now.
###1735 No significant plot changes, nothing like that,
###1738 but a lot of the wording.
###1740 It's much more polished.
###1741 And it's much better now thanks to Julian at Random House.
###1746 And so the audio book guys, Podium Publishing, decided,
###1751 well, we'll re-record it from scratch.
###1752 And I told them, A-S-C-I-I- is pronounced AS-key.
###1757 So I think they'll get it right in the newer version.
###1761 AUDIENCE: So I listened to the audio version, too.
###1763 I really liked it.
###1765 So there was a lot in the book about NASA politics
###1771 and what happened inside NASA.
###1775 Did you just dream that up?
###1777 Or did you know somebody on the inside?
###1778 Or how did that work?
###1779 ANDY WEIR: Made it all up.
###1782 AUDIENCE: It sounded very real.
###1783 ANDY WEIR: I thought so.
###1784 Well, I've worked for the government before.
###1788 As he mentioned, my first job was Sandia National Labs
###1790 as a little weaselly computer programmer at age 15,
###1796 as opposed to the 41-year-old weaselly computer
###1798 programmer I am now.
###1799 And I just saw how things worked there.
###1804 And I said, like, well, NASA's a big federal agency.
###1807 So was Sandia.
###1808 So I'll just assume that they're kind of similar.
###1812 But, yeah, I made all that up.
###1814 
###1817 I had no contact with NASA or astronauts or anyone
###1821 in the industry at all before writing the book.
###1823 And I've since gotten a lot of emails from them.
###1825 And they say that that's about right.
###1827 
###1831 AUDIENCE: Not really a question, I'll
###1833 just note that besides Amazon Kindle,
###1835 it's also available at Google Play Books.
###1839 ANDY WEIR: All right.
###1840 There you go.
###1841 AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].
###1842 ANDY WEIR: It's also available on barnesandnoble.com.
###1844 
###1846 MALE SPEAKER: Andy, what's on your reading list?
###1849 ANDY WEIR: What's on my reading list?
###1851 I really like to read the old classic sci-fi stuff, which
###1854 I've read before and just keep reading again and again.
###1857 So Heinlein, Clarke, Asimov, that sort of thing.
###1860 Those are my favorite authors.
###1861 And then also anything by Terry Pratchett, completely out
###1864 of the sci-fi world, but Terry Pratchett.
###1867 Also I really like Robert Asprin.
###1870 But he died.
###1872 But that apparently didn't stop him
###1874 from making new books because I see
###1875 there's a new release that's by Robert Asprin.
###1879 And I'm not sure how that happened.
###1881 So either someone else has taken up
###1883 the role of writing Robert Asprin.
###1884 Books.
###1885 Or it's some manuscript he was partially through,
###1887 or I don't know.
###1888 AUDIENCE: So right after "The Martian,"
###1890 I read-- speaking of old sci-fi--
###1891 if I read "When Worlds Collide," which is from 1933, I think.
###1895 And the jump from scientific accuracy
###1899 to scientific hand-waving was never so great.
###1902 Because there was a spaceship.
###1903 And they fly.
###1904 And they just sort of say, yeah, let's build a spaceship now.
###1907 And we'll fly to this new planet.
###1908 And that'll work.
###1909 ANDY WEIR: It seems reasonable.
###1911 Or when they're like-- oh, I never read the book
###1913 but I saw the movie from the '50s--
###1915 and they land their spaceship on the new planet,
###1917 the one that just destroyed Earth, and they're like,
###1919 well, let's go outside.
###1920 And they're like, what?
###1920 You don't know if the atmosphere is good.
###1922 And it's like, well, if it's no good,
###1923 we're all going to die anyway.
###1926 Yeah, it's good.
###1927 AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
###1930 AUDIENCE: Yeah, speaking of old sci-fi,
###1932 there was a couple of the early Doc Smith novels
###1934 that had roughly the same set-up-- guy
###1937 crashes on an outer system planet
###1939 and has to build up civilization until he can make a radio.
###1944 Have you read any of those?
###1945 And can you bring yourself to having done the research now?
###1948 ANDY WEIR: I did not read any of those.
###1951 As for the research, that was just really important to me.
###1954 I just wanted to be as accurate as I possibly could.
###1957 There are a few places that are inaccurate.
###1959 The biggest place that's inaccurate
###1960 is right at the beginning.
###1963 Don't tell anybody, but if you're in a dust storm on Mars,
###1966 you're not even going to feel it.
###1967 Mars' atmosphere is less than 1% of Earth's.
###1970 So a 150 kilometer an hour wind would feel
###1973 like about a 1 kilometer an hour wind does on Earth.
###1976 It wouldn't do any damage to anything.
###1977 Shh.
###1979 I had other ways of doing it.
###1981 I had an idea where the MAV would have some sort of failure
###1984 that caused an explosion which does all the damage.
###1987 And they're short on time because the MAV fuel
###1989 tank is leaking, so they need to lift off.
###1991 And they're sure Mark's dead and stuff like that.
###1993 But most people don't know how Martian dust storms work.
###1997 Most people don't realize that it's not
###1999 like being in a sand blaster.
###2000 And it's just more dramatic that way.
###2002 So I just made that concession.
###2004 I know I'm a liar.
###2007 I just wanted that more.
###2008 It was more dramatic.
###2010 AUDIENCE: So there used to be a sci-fi story by George Landis.
###2016 The title was "A Walk in the Sun."
###2020 There was an accident, and an astronaut
###2022 has to survive by her own on the moon for one
###2025 month until rescuers arrive.
###2027 So that's very similar to this set-up.
###2029 Have you read that?
###2030 ANDY WEIR: I haven't.
###2031 AUDIENCE: OK.
###2031 ANDY WEIR: But basically "The Martian"
###2034 can be described as Robinson Crusoe on Mars, right?
###2037 Except for there was a movie called
###2039 "Robinson Crusoe on Mars," and my story
###2041 does not have a monkey sidekick.
###2043 
###2045 AUDIENCE: You should consider a monkey sidekick.
###2047 Yeah, are you considering one?
###2049 ANDY WEIR: There should have been a monkey sidekick.
###2051 I see that now.
###2052 AUDIENCE: If they adapt this for Hollywood, [INAUDIBLE].
###2055 ANDY WEIR: There's clearly going to be a monkey sidekick.
###2058 There would have to be.
###2059 Well, they might adapt it for Hollywood.
###2061 20th Century Fox optioned the movie rights.
###2063 So they could make a movie.
###2065 We'll see.
###2066 AUDIENCE: The most important question, when can we
###2068 expect another book from you?
###2070 ANDY WEIR: Well, I'm working on a pitch
###2071 right now for my next book.
###2073 But I've been so busy with the-- it's
###2075 real busy for a writer around the time
###2077 his book comes out, let me tell you.
###2078 So I've been doing stuff related to that.
###2080 But as soon as things calm down, I'll work on the pitch.
###2083 And then if they like it, I'll start writing it.
###2085 And it'll probably take me maybe a year.
###2087 AUDIENCE: Or you could just self-publish it and put it up
###2090 on Amazon if they don't like it.
###2091 ANDY WEIR: If Random House gives me a bunch of money,
###2096 they're going to want me not to put it up for free.
###2098 AUDIENCE: Not free, but you know.
###2101 As long as you write something.
###2102 I mean, seriously, this is the best
###2103 book I've read in a long time.
###2104 ANDY WEIR: Well, thank you.
###2106 Glad you liked it.
###2107 AUDIENCE: I will say I'm only halfway through it.
###2109 But that's got to be the best first line
###2111 since "it was a dark and stormy night."
###2115 ANDY WEIR: Thank you.
###2116 
###2119 I figure you have one line to convince the reader
###2121 to read the first paragraph.
###2123 And you have one paragraph to convince
###2124 them to read the first page.
###2126 And if they read the first page, you've
###2127 probably got them for a while anyway.
###2129 But that first line is important.
###2132 AUDIENCE: I was going to say, partially
###2132 to what you were saying before, even if the atmosphere is
###2135 really thin but it's blowing around chunks of sand,
###2137 wouldn't the mass of the sand moving at that speed still
###2140 cause a lot of damage?
###2141 ANDY WEIR: Right, but the sand that it's blowing around
###2143 in a dust storm is basically like talcum powder.
###2145 AUDIENCE: Fair enough.
###2146 ANDY WEIR: It's not like big granules.
###2147 AUDIENCE: The actual question I was going ask
###2149 is how much of the ending and sort of storyboard
###2151 was known when you started the book,
###2153 and how much was made up as you went along?
###2156 ANDY WEIR: Most of it was made up as I went along.
###2158 I had some ideas for how the ending would go.
###2160 And it didn't go that way because it didn't make sense
###2162 with how the story developed.
###2164 They say there are two kinds of writers-- the plotters
###2169 and the pantsers, right?
###2171 Plotters work everything out in an outline format and say,
###2173 this is what's going to happen.
###2174 Pantsers are like, eh, let's just see what happens.
###2176 And I'm the latter, for sure.
###2178 So at the end, I had this in my mind
###2181 the whole time I'm writing the book is here's
###2182 what the final scene's going to be.
###2183 And it's going to be awesome.
###2184 Here's how it's going to be.
###2185 And it couldn't be that way.
###2186 
###2190 AUDIENCE: So related to that, your protagonist
###2192 has to overcome a lot of problems.
###2194 So which came first?
###2195 The problems that you'd have to find a clever solution for?
###2197 Or you came up with the solution and said,
###2199 how do I get in that situation?
###2200 ANDY WEIR: I would start with the problems.
###2201 What I wanted to do was have the problems--
###2203 I didn't want him to just get struck by lightning
###2205 over and over, figuratively.
###2208 I didn't want there to be too many coincidences.
###2212 So I wanted all of his problems to either derive
###2214 from the fact that he's using outdated equipment,
###2217 or that he's using equipment in ways
###2219 that it wasn't intended to be used.
###2220 So the solution to his previous problem
###2222 would often cause the next problem.
###2225 And so I would try to come up with the problems first.
###2228 Then I'd come up with the solutions.
###2229 The cool thing is, though, being a writer I can cheat.
###2232 So every now and then, I'd get him into trouble,
###2235 and I'd be like, he can't get out of this.
###2237 He's going to die.
###2238 OK, I'm going to go back a few chapters
###2239 and put in some stuff that, oh, and this leads to that
###2243 and this leads to that.
###2244 And here's this thing that he'll have access
###2247 to which can solve this problem.
###2250 AUDIENCE: I don't know how much insight you have into this,
###2252 but which of your sales channels seems
###2255 to be doing best in this day and age?
###2257 So I've found the book on [INAUDIBLE] blog
###2260 and read it in the last few days.
###2263 How much does that sort of thing help?
###2265 And electronic versus physical?
###2267 ANDY WEIR: The answer is, I don't know.
###2269 I do know that right now, in this release-- so it released
###2275 officially two days ago, so we're
###2276 just right at the beginning-- I do know
###2279 that the digital version is outselling
###2281 the physical version.
###2282 
###2286 That's usually the case early on because there's still
###2292 pipelining and delivery hiccups here and there
###2296 for various bookstores.
###2297 And we also don't get a lot of our reports from bookstores.
###2301 But anyway, more specific than that,
###2303 when it comes down to how did somebody
###2305 end up at the page where they buy it?
###2307 I don't know.
###2307 I don't have that data.
###2311 AUDIENCE: But you do think that posting
###2313 to whatever was a good idea?
###2315 ANDY WEIR: Oh, well, so that was mostly-- in fact, all of that--
###2319 was arranged by Random House's marketing and publicity.
###2322 So they said, like, then they arranged it
###2324 with the site owners and blogs and stuff like that, and said,
###2330 we'd like you to be on all of these.
###2331 Let's see which ones of them are interested in having you.
###2334 And they do that kind of matchmaking.
###2337 I have this big folder full of what
###2339 I called homework, just essays and articles and things that I
###2341 write, which was one of the reasons I've
###2343 been too busy to work on the next book.
###2347 AUDIENCE: So do you still have a day job?
###2349 Or are you now a full-time writer?
###2351 ANDY WEIR: I still have a day job.
###2352 I work for MobileIron.
###2353 I am an Android programmer.
###2355 And I've warned everybody at my company so they know this.
###2361 If I get an advance for this next novel that I'm pitching,
###2364 then I'm going to quit the day job.
###2366 
###2369 AUDIENCE: Maybe you don't know the specifics of this,
###2371 but what with the vagaries of having been published twice,
###2377 are you eligible for next year's Hugos?
###2382 ANDY WEIR: I don't know.
###2385 I hadn't thought about awards at all.
###2388 (WHISPERING) I'll find out.
###2391 AUDIENCE: What did you think of the movie "Gravity"?
###2394 ANDY WEIR: I liked it a lot.
###2395 I thought it was really beautiful cinematography,
###2397 first off.
###2397 And it had a bunch of accuracy problems.
###2402 But, I mean, you can't get too picky.
###2406 It wasn't supposed to be a space station tutorial.
###2410 It was supposed to be an exciting movie.
###2412 And what was it?
###2413 Like for one thing, ISS and the Hubble
###2417 are in orbits that are nowhere near each other,
###2419 nowhere near the same velocity.
###2421 In fact, NASA did, at one point, try to arrange a mission
###2426 where they would repair the Hubble from ISS.
###2428 And they could not find any way to make that work.
###2430 
###2433 So there are few errors in "Gravity,"
###2436 but I liked it a lot.
###2437 It is kind of inconvenient, though, because I released
###2440 "The Martian" before "Gravity" came out.
###2442 I wrote it all before "Gravity" came out.
###2444 Now the re-release of "The Martian,"
###2446 people are like, oh, hey, this is like "Gravity."
###2449 I'm like, no, "Gravity"'s like me.
###2451 
###2455 AUDIENCE: I was wondering, did you
###2457 manage to get any input on the cover?
###2458 I mean, it looks really nice.
###2460 ANDY WEIR: Thanks.
###2461 That's actually funny.
###2463 I didn't like it.
###2466 And they said, hey, here's the cover we're going to go.
###2470 The Random House's art department
###2471 said-- here's this whole big thing
###2474 that they did-- and they said, here it is.
###2477 And I said, I don't like it.
###2479 But everybody else does.
###2481 So I'm glad I was wrong.
###2483 Or I'm glad-- how do I put it?
###2484 I'm glad I didn't have any say.
###2486 
###2490 Although I did point out one problem.
###2492 Originally, in the-- that's an actual photo of an astronaut
###2496 who is on a space shuttle mission at the time
###2499 this photo was taken.
###2500 I mean, obviously all the red stuff is Photoshopped.
###2503 But in his helmet, you could see the reflection
###2506 of the space shuttle cargo bay.
###2508 And I pointed that.
###2509 I'm like, nah.
###2510 So they fixed that.
###2513 AUDIENCE: What would you prefer?
###2515 ANDY WEIR: I imagined-- well, the Dutch cover--
###2520 so every language that's selling-- it's
###2523 getting translated into 21 languages
###2525 and pretty much every one of them has their own cover art.
###2529 And the Dutch cover is kind of what I liked.
###2531 It's just basically a lone figure, very small,
###2535 like, in the middle there and just big, empty Martian scenery
###2539 just to show there's isolation and stuff.
###2542 And I thought that was cool.
###2543 But this is like-- there are actually
###2545 websites that just judge books by their cover.
###2547 Like that's literally what they do.
###2549 They say--
###2549 [LAUGHTER]
###2552 Literally all they do is they say,
###2554 like, we're rating covers of new release,
###2556 not the content of the book, nothing.
###2558 Just think of them as artistic analysis websites.
###2561 And they loved the cover of "The Martian."
###2564 AUDIENCE: By the way, great title, too.
###2565 ANDY WEIR: Thanks.
###2567 Yeah, a lot of people will say, oh, like pro tip,
###2569 there's no actual Martians in this.
###2572 There's no aliens.
###2573 He's the Martian, you see, because he's stuck there.
###2577 MALE SPEAKER: Tell me, so how did you actually
###2579 start to think about writing a story of somebody on Mars?
###2584 I know we talked a little bit about this
###2585 before the talk itself.
###2587 We're sort of an Apollo generation type of thing.
###2590 But what was that moment that's, hey,
###2594 I'm going to write a story about Mars.
###2595 Why?
###2596 ANDY WEIR: Well, dork that I am, I
###2599 was imagining how a manned Mars mission could work.
###2602 And so I was just trying to say, realistically,
###2605 how do you get the astronauts to Mars?
###2607 How do you build a ship big enough to support them?
###2610 How does that work?
###2611 How do you get it there?
###2612 That's why I had use ion engines because it was just
###2614 too implausible otherwise.
###2615 It's like once they're there, what do they do?
###2617 How do they get back?
###2619 And, oh, you could send all the supplies in advance.
###2621 It uses heavily from Mars Direct, which is--
###2625 MALE SPEAKER: Zubrin's plan.
###2626 ANDY WEIR: Yeah, Zubrin's suggested
###2629 way of doing a Mars mission, which if and when
###2632 we have a Mars mission in the real world,
###2634 it will almost certainly be something very much like that.
###2636 Anyway I was considering all the things that could go wrong.
###2639 I was saying, any mission plan has
###2641 to account for things that can go wrong and say, oh,
###2643 if this happens, then the astronaut should do this.
###2645 If this happens, they should do this.
###2647 And I started thinking of all these failure scenarios.
###2649 And those started to seem really interesting to me.
###2652 So I made a poor, hapless main character
###2654 to suffer through them all.
###2655 
###2658 MALE SPEAKER: The readers won't suffer if they read this book.
###2661 I'm sure about that.
###2662 So please give thanks to Andy Weir.
###2664 [APPLAUSE]
