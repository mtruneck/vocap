KID PRESIDENT>> I think we all need a pep
talk.


2
0:0:6,88 --> 0:0:15,119
[slow electric guitar riff music]
KID PRESIDENT>>The world needs to stop being


3
0:0:15,119 --> 0:0:16,449
boring.
Yeah, you!


4
0:0:16,449 --> 0:0:20,289
Boring is easy, everybody can be boring. But
you're gooder than that.


5
0:0:20,289 --> 0:0:25,689
Life is not a game people. Life isn't a cereal
either. Well, it is a cereal.


6
0:0:25,689 --> 0:0:31,259
And if life is a game, aren't we all on the
same team?


7
0:0:31,259 --> 0:0:35,6
I mean really right?
I'm on your team, be on my team.


8
0:0:35,6 --> 0:0:38,94
This is life people, you've got air coming
through your nose!


9
0:0:38,94 --> 0:0:42,85
You've got a heart beat!
That means it's time to do somethin'!


10
0:0:42,85 --> 0:0:46,47
A poem.
"Two roads diverged in the woods...


11
0:0:46,47 --> 0:0:50,61
and I took the road less traveled...
AND IT HURT MAN!


12
0:0:50,61 --> 0:0:51,9
Really bad.
Rocks!


13
0:0:51,9 --> 0:0:52,76
Thorns!
Glass!


14
0:0:52,76 --> 0:0:53,82
My pants broke!
NOT COOL ROBERT FROST!


15
0:0:53,82 --> 0:1:4,879
But what if there really were two paths?
I want to be on the one that leads to awesome.


16
0:1:4,879 --> 0:1:11,15
It's like that dude Journey said, don't stop
believing, unless your dream is stupid. Then


17
0:1:11,15 --> 0:1:14,34
you should get a better dream. I think that's
how it goes.


18
0:1:14,34 --> 0:1:18,54
Get a better dream, then keep goin', and goin',
and keep goin'.


19
0:1:18,54 --> 0:1:24,73
What if Michael Jordan had quit? Well, he
did quit. But he retired, yeah that's it,


20
0:1:24,73 --> 0:1:27,11
he retired. But before that? In highschool?
What if he quit when he didn't make the team?


21
0:1:27,11 --> 0:1:33,39
He would have never made Space Jam. And I
love Space Jam.


22
0:1:33,39 --> 0:1:39,25
What will be your Space Jam? What will you
create when you make the world awesome?


23
0:1:39,25 --> 0:1:44,479
Nothing if you keep sittin' there! This is
why I'm talking to you today!


24
0:1:44,479 --> 0:1:46,2
This is your time.
This is my time.


25
0:1:46,2 --> 0:1:48,88
This is our time.
We can make everyday better for each other.


26
0:1:48,88 --> 0:1:54,54
If we're all on the same team, let's start
acting like it. We've got work to do.


27
0:1:54,54 --> 0:1:58,45
We can cry about it, or we can dance about
it.


28
0:1:58,45 --> 0:2:5,479
You were made to be awesome.
Let's get out there!


29
0:2:5,479 --> 0:2:25,139
I don't know everything, I'm just a kid, but
I do know this:


30
0:2:25,139 --> 0:2:30,189
It's everybodies duty to do good, and give
the world a reason to dance.


31
0:2:30,189 --> 0:2:30,54
So get to it.


32
0:2:30,54 --> 0:2:30,709
[driving music]


33
0:2:30,709 --> 0:2:32,31
You've just been pep talked.
Create something that will make the world


34
0:2:32,31 --> 0:2:32,939
awesome.


35
0:2:32,939 --> 0:2:34,84
[electric guitar riff]


36
0:2:34,84 --> 0:2:36,99
Play ball!


37
0:2:36,99 --> 0:2:39,26
[movie reel sound]
[crashing noise]


38
0:2:39,26 --> 0:2:45,169
Oh hi everybody!
We're all workin' hard to make this an awesome


39
0:2:45,169 --> 0:2:48,219
year for other people, and you guys are doin'
it!


40
0:2:48,219 --> 0:2:51,749
You've been super encouraging to me, so I
want to return the favor.


41
0:2:51,749 --> 0:2:56,109
Who do you know that needs some encouragement?
Pass this pep talk along, and get the whole


42
0:2:56,109 --> 0:3:2,1
world to dance.
I dedicate this video today to my friend Gabbi.


43
0:3:2,1 --> 0:3:7,629
She's a cool kid, she likes pancakes, and
she's fighting cancer. Like a BOSS.


44
0:3:7,629 --> 0:3:10,379
And to all you watching, who encourages you?
Send them this video, and let them know.


45
0:3:10,379 --> 0:3:12,739
So get to it!


46
0:3:12,739 --> 0:3:14,319
[music burst]


47
0:3:14,319 --> 0:3:15,109
Bye!
