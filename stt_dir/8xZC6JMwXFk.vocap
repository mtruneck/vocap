###3 I got the afternoon free.
###5 You want to watch some of that doubleheader?
###7 Actually, I'd love to,
###8 but I'm going downtown to watch it with the guys.
###12 Um, why wasn't I invited?
###16 For the same reason we didn't invite Bernie Madoff,
###18 because we knew you were unavailable.
###20 Listen, man, you just got married.
###22 The other guys have been married for years,
###23 and they still have to lie about where they're going.
###26 Oh, yeah?
###27 Well, I can go if I want to,
###28 and I don't have to lie about it.
###30 So you're going to tell Suzanne
###32 that you're gonna spend six hours on a Sunday in a bar,
###35 drinking beer and watching baseball with a bunch of dudes?
###38 $50 says that's exactly what I'm gonna say.
###42 Exactly?
###44 Exactly-exactly.
###46 Come on, mom.
###47 That isn't fair.
###48 That's like t.I. Going to jail
###50 for killing Patrick Swayze.
###52 Lindsey, that makes no sense.
###54 Exactly.
###56 What's going on?
###58 Oh, well, the kids are asking me about their allowance,
###61 but they haven't done any work around the house all week.
###63 Now, I pay you guys an allowance to be nice;
###66 I'm not gonna pay y'all just to live here anymore.
###69 Come on, your mother is right.
###71 You kids know an allowance is payment for work,
###74 just like a job.
###75 If you don't do your job, you don't get paid.
###77 Thank you, Nick.
###79 We promise to do more work this week.
###81 Yeah, we promise.
###82 And I promise to pay you when you do the work.
###86 What about this week?
###87 You should've thought about this week last week.
###90 If you don't start thinking about next week this week,
###92 you're going to have the same problem next week
###94 that you're having this week,
###95 when you could've solved it last week.
###97 So we're not gonna get our money from last week
###99 until next week?
###101 What about this week?
###102 There is no "this week."
###104 Now, I don't understand what you're worried about.
###106 You have everything you need.
###107 But it's summer. We need disposable income.
###109 Well, by being lazy, you threw away last week's allowance.
###113 So I suggest,
###115 unless you want to dispose of this week's allowance,
###117 you get to work.
###118 Got it?
###119 Got it.
###123 Oh, hello, Martin.
###125 Hi, Suzanne.
###126 What are you guys up to today?
###128 Hmm.
###129 What are we up to, Nick?
###131 Today I am going to a sports bar, on a Sunday,
###133 for six hours, to drink beer and watch baseball
###136 with a bunch of dudes.
###137 Great. Good for you.
###141 See?
###142 A real man doesn't have to lie to his wife.
###144 Now pay up.
###146 Next week.

###164 hi, there.
###170 Hi, there. Welcome to Booty.
###172 Hello.
###174 Man, I thought we were going to a regular sports bar.
###176 You didn't tell me we were going to Booty.
###178 What's wrong with Booty?
###179 It's a pirate-themed sports bar, hence the name "booty,"
###182 like treasure.
###183 Hmm, hi, guys.
###185 That's treasure.
###186 Man, I gotta get out of here.
###188 How am I gonna explain this to Suzanne?
###190 Oh, aren't you the real man
###191 who doesn't have to lie to his wife?
###193 We're doing exactly what you said we were gonna do:
###195 We're at the bar, drinking beer, watching the game.
###197 Yeah, but she's gonna want to know
###199 why I had to watch the game here.
###200 Because Booty has such amazing...
###203 Wings.
###205 Ah, there are the guys.
###207 Aha. Ahoy, mateys.
###210 Arrr.
###214 Ah, these wings are disgusting.
###218 What's the score of the game?
###220 Uh, 36 to 24
###222 to 40.
###224 Wow, this is a high-scoring game.
###229 So what did you tell Suzanne to get out of the house?
###231 I told her I was coming to watch the game.
###233 Huh, I didn't.
###234 I told my wife I was going to the grocery store.
###236 And on my way home, I'll be sure to stop at the grocery store.
###241 Yeah, I told my wife I was going to a strip club,
###244 but instead I came here.
###247 What is wrong with you, man?
###249 I got an idea.
###251 Let's tell treasure that it's Nick's birthday,
###253 and we'll get them to give him
###254 one of their special birthday celebrations.
###256 Ugh. Love that.
###257 What special birthday celebration?
###260 Come on, man.
###260 You never had a Booty birthday?
###262 No, and I don't want a Booty birthday.
###264 I didn't know it was your birthday, Nick.
###266 How old are you?
###267 Dude, I'm not... Oh, treasure.
###269 This scallywag be having a birthday.
###271 Hey.
###272 Someone has a birthday?
###274 Ladies, come on over here.
###275 We got a birthday.
###276 Happy Birthday.

###314 We finished all our chores.
###315 I cleaned up my room,
###316 and I took all the clothes out of my hamper.
###318 Yup, and I made my bed and unclogged the toilet.
###322 Kevin, aren't you the one who clogged the toilet?
###325 Yeah, it was a good one.
###328 So do we get our allowances now?
###332 Guys, I'm really proud of you for doing those things,
###334 but no.
###335 So I unclogged the toilet for nothing?
###339 No, you unclogged the toilet 'cause that's nasty.
###341 So what exactly do we need to do to get our allowance?
###345 You need to show some initiative,
###346 and I'll pay you for what it's worth.
###348 We are showing initiative. How?
###351 By trying to convince you to give us money.
###365 I'm so glad you had a good time today with your friends.
###368 Where'd you guys go, anyway?
###370 No-hitter?
###372 No, I don't think so.
###373 It was some other place.
###376 Was it the scoreboard?
###379 No, I don't think so.
###381 Well, there's only a few sports bars.
###383 You guys were downtown, right?
###386 Yeah, I think so.
###390 You think so?
###392 Were you, or weren't you?
###395 I don't know.
###396 You know, Martin was driving.
###397 I was just out having a good time.
###401 Nick.
###403 Were you or weren't you downtown at a sports bar,
###405 watching the baseball game?
###408 I was.
###411 Well...
###414 You weren't at the scoreboard.
###417 You weren't at no-hitter.
###419 So where were you?
###422 Dang, I don't remember the name of it.
###424 Well, the only other place that's open on Sundays is Booty,
###429 and I know you weren't at Booty.
###432 Hmm.
###434 Which one was that again?
###436 The one with all the girls with the big booties
###440 dressed in pirate outfits.
###443 Hmm.
###446 Come to think of it,
###448 yeah, I think that's where we were.
###451 You spent six hours drinking,
###456 watching the game with your friends at Booty?
###460 Baby, you told me to go out and have a good time.
###462 Not when it's at Booty!
###463 Baby, it's not what you think.
###465 Look, they just have the most tvs, the cheapest beer,
###468 and the best wings.
###469 You lied to me.
###470 No, I didn't.
###471 Look, baby, I didn't even know that's where we were going
###474 until we got there.
###475 Okay, so why didn't you tell me that's where you were
###477 when you got home?
###479 Because it didn't come up.
###480 And when it did, I told you.
###482 So what's the problem?
###484 You really don't know what the problem is?
###486 No, I don't.
###489 Well, you are about to find out.
###509 Here's some more orange juice for you, mom.
###511 Thank you, Lindsey.
###512 Yeah, let me get that for you, mom.
###515 Thank you, Kevin.
###516 And we also got up extra early
###518 and washed your car and swept up the front yard.
###520 So can we have our allowances now?
###523 No.
###524 What? How come?
###526 Well, because I noticed that your beds aren't made,
###528 and, Lindsey, you have clothes all over the floor,
###530 and, Kevin, the toilet is backed up again.
###534 Just because you wake up early and wash my car
###536 and clean the front yard
###538 doesn't mean you get to neglect your everyday chores.
###541 So I washed your car for nothing?
###543 You didn't wash my car for nothing.
###545 Now both of you go upstairs and clean your rooms.
###548 Hi, Nick.
###549 Hey.
###553 Where's my breakfast?
###557 Why don't you eat at Booty,
###558 since you love their food so much?
###562 Where's your breakfast?
###566 That's ridiculous.
###567 They don't even serve breakfast.
###579 Let me ask you something, Gigi.
###581 What do you do when you find out
###583 a man's been withholding information from you?
###586 Well, it depends on two things:
###591 The kind of information and how I found out.
###593 Like, this one time I found out
###595 not only was this guy cheating on me,
###597 but he was lying about his money.
###599 How'd you find out?
###600 The other woman told me.
###601 He and I had just come back from Aruba,
###603 and she said he had just taken <i>her</i> to Aruba.
###607 And I was gonna stay with him,
###608 until I found out where he was getting his money from.
###611 Where? From her.
###613 If I'd known that, I would have gone to Aruba with her,
###615 and we both could have got a man.
###617 Does that help?
###619 Not really.
###620 Oh.
###622 Is Nick hiding something from you?
###625 Well, yesterday, he went to watch baseball for six hours
###627 with his friends at Booty.
###629 Booty?
###630 I love Booty.
###632 You do? I do.
###633 It's so much fun.
###634 How'd you find out?
###636 I asked him, and he admitted he went.
###640 You--you asked him a question,
###642 and he could've lied, but he told you the truth,
###645 and now you're mad at him?
###646 Yes.
###647 I can see that.

###673 Mm-hmm. So who won the game?
###675 The, um...
###679 And that's why it's a big deal.
###681 Oh, so now I got to tell you about every place I go
###683 to do everything I do?
###684 When you go grocery shopping, I don't know exactly where you go.

###706 Look, Suzanne, it's not like that.

###712 All right? All kinds of people go there.
###714 Families, everybody.
###715 Really? Really.
###717 Okay, fine.
###718 I believe you.
###720 Thank you.
###721 So tonight you, me and the kids are going to eat at Booty.
###724 Excuse me?
###725 We're gonna order the wings.
###728 And you can turn your music back on.
###736  so you sure you want to do this?
###738 Yep, I really want to taste those wings.
###746 I can't believe we're really going to eat there.
###748 Me neither. This is awesome.
###749 I've always wanted to go there.
###751 For what?
###752 It's food served by pirates.
###755 Yeah,
###756 in Booty shorts.
###769 Well, here we are,
###770 just like you wanted.
###772 Whoa, look at the size of those jugs.
###775 Kevin, that is no way to talk about a woman.
###778 He's talking about the pitchers of beer.
###781 Oh.
###782 Whoa. Look how big that Booty is.
###786 He's talking about the treasure chest by the door.
###788 No, I'm not.
###790 This place is tacky.
###792 Are we really gonna eat here?
###793 Yes, we are.
###794 I'm doing this to prove a point to your father.
###797 What point?
###798 That he has no taste in food?
###800 Oh, hey, Nick. How you doing?
###803 How's it going?
###804 Treasure?
###805 I'm Suzanne. I'm Nick's wife.
###806 Oh, Suzanne.
###807 Beautiful.
###808 I didn't know you were married, Nick.
###810 That's great.
###811 Wow, and you have your beautiful kids with you.
###813 Thank you.
###814 Okay, so what can I get you to order?
###815 We have heard so much about those wings.
###818 Ah, those wings.
###819 So how about I bring you some over?
###821 Great. All right, birthday boy.
###822 I'll be right back.
###824 Birthday boy?
###827 Oh, I almost forgot.
###830 Martin and the guys thought it'd be funny
###831 if they told the waitresses it was my birthday.
###833 Oh, and what type of celebration do they do?
###838 Oh...
###839 You just get some free wings, and they sing <i>happy birthday.</i>
###842 It's no big deal.

###881 You're the one that dragged me down there.
###882 Yeah, but I didn't tell you
###884 to turn it into a family field trip.
###886 It doesn't matter.
###887 She would've gotten mad anyway.
###889 Yes, but if you had told her,
###890 she would've gotten mad ahead of time,
###892 which is a lot better.
###894 None of this would have happened
###895 if she hadn't seen that stupid birthday celebration.
###899 Nick, please tell me she did not witness a Booty birthday.
###904 She witnessed a Booty birthday.
###906 Oh, come on, man.
###908 Listen, you say you want my help,
###910 but then you won't even tell me everything that happened.
###912 You're like Keyser Soze,
###914 just dolling out little pieces of information,
###916 hoping I'll figure it out like I'm the closer or something.
###919 Do I look like Kyra Sedgwick to you?
###922 You want my advice? Here it is:
###924 Be Nick. Okay?
###926 Don't be some phony-acting Nick
###927 who thinks he can do whatever he wants,
###929 even though he's married,
###930 because if your wife is mad at you
###931 and you were with me, it's only a matter of time
###934 before I start catching heat.
###935 And if I wanted some wife to be mad at me,
###937 I'd go to Russia and I'd buy one of my own.
###949 Okay, mom, we finished everything.
###952 So can we have our allowances now?
###954 Well, I guess you guys have earned it.
###956 Yes. Yes.
###958 All right, Kevin, go get my purse, please.
###966 Thank you.
###967 $50.

###974 That's it?
###975 If would've known we were only going to get paid $5,
###977 we would have never did any of this stuff.
###979 Which is exactly why I didn't tell you
###981 I was giving you $5.
###983 Okay. I'm gonna go back upstairs,
###985 take all my clothes out of my hamper,
###987 and throw them back down on the floor.
###988 I'm gonna go reclog the toilet.

###1109 That he's gonna leave you for a girl with a big Booty
###1112 and a bucket of wings?
###1113 I don't know.
###1115 Let me tell you this:
###1116 Big Booty is unavoidable.
###1119 It's at the park.
###1120 It's at the grocery store.
###1122 It's even at church.
###1124 You can't hide from big Booty.
###1127 Big booty--it's everywhere.
###1130 I know that Booty is everywhere.
###1133 I don't need him to pretend it's not.
###1135 But if he's gonna go there, I just want to know about it.
###1137 That's all.
###1139 Well, have you tried telling him that?
###1143 I mean, come on.
###1143 You're good. Thank you.
###1155 Man, I don't know how you do it.
###1158 I wish I was more like you.
###1159 Every time you get in trouble, you just blurt out the truth.
###1163 They always say the cover-up is worse than the crime.
###1169 Hey, baby. Hey.
###1171 I just ran into the kids.
###1174 Thank you for backing me up.
###1176 Well, you're right.
###1177 You're teaching them a valuable lesson.
###1179 I'm trying to.
###1181 You know you could've just told me you were at Booty.
###1185 I was afraid you would have gotten mad.
###1186 That's right. I would have.
###1188 Then what am I supposed to do?
###1190 You're supposed to get used to me getting mad at things.
###1192 Great.
###1193 No, but I would've gotten over it.
###1195 You know, I don't understand why you even want to go there.
###1197 Okay, I understand...
###1198 Look, it's not even that I want to go to Booty.
###1201 It's just that I don't like knowing there are places
###1203 I might want to go and can't.
###1205 Nick, I don't care where you go.
###1208 I just care about what you do.
###1210 I'll tell you what:
###1211 You tell me beforehand, and you can go to Booty
###1214 any time you want--
###1215 except your actual birthday.
###1218 Why?
###1219 What do you think I might do?
###1220 End up in the hospital
