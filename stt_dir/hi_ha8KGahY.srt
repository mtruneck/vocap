2
0:0:1,72 --> 0:0:3,15
NIMROD KAMER: Venice, 2012.


3
0:0:3,15 --> 0:0:5,61
The 69th annual film festival.


4
0:0:5,61 --> 0:0:8,5
I had only been there a day
and already casted Danny


5
0:0:8,5 --> 0:0:12,58
Huston in a pirate bay film
financed by Harvey Weinstein.


6
0:0:12,58 --> 0:0:15,46
I am Nimrod Kamer, a social
climber disguised as a


7
0:0:15,46 --> 0:0:16,52
journalist.


8
0:0:16,52 --> 0:0:18,33
And this is my film,
"How to Make It


9
0:0:18,33 --> 0:0:20,83
#Huge in the Film Industry--


10
0:0:20,83 --> 0:0:23,44
and also Persuade Some Chicks
to Put MDMA up My Rectum and


11
0:0:23,44 --> 0:0:32,13
Leave it on the Shelf."


12
0:0:32,13 --> 0:0:34,12
That morning, I woke up
on the red carpet.


13
0:0:34,12 --> 0:0:36,48
Good one.


14
0:0:36,48 --> 0:0:37,65
Do you want to interview me?


15
0:0:37,65 --> 0:0:38,7
-No.


16
0:0:38,7 --> 0:0:38,91
No.


17
0:0:38,91 --> 0:0:40,17
NIMROD KAMER: You can
ask me something.


18
0:0:40,17 --> 0:0:40,52
-What?


19
0:0:40,52 --> 0:0:43,69
NIMROD KAMER: You can ask
me about my life.


20
0:0:43,69 --> 0:0:45,43
My father is one
of the actors.


21
0:0:45,43 --> 0:0:47,15
-Oh, really?


22
0:0:47,15 --> 0:0:47,52
NIMROD KAMER: Yeah.


23
0:0:47,52 --> 0:0:47,79
-Oh, OK.


24
0:0:47,79 --> 0:0:48,6
Look.


25
0:0:48,6 --> 0:0:49,78
Maybe she's--


26
0:0:49,78 --> 0:0:52,53
NIMROD KAMER: Oh, if you want
to interview me, it's OK.


27
0:0:52,53 --> 0:0:54,55
I'm Joachim Phoenix's cousin.


28
0:0:54,55 --> 0:0:55,165
-Really?


29
0:0:55,165 --> 0:0:55,47
NIMROD KAMER: Yeah, yeah.


30
0:0:55,47 --> 0:0:56,19
-Amazing.


31
0:0:56,19 --> 0:0:57,41
NIMROD KAMER: Did you
see the film?


32
0:0:57,41 --> 0:0:57,99
-Not yet.


33
0:0:57,99 --> 0:0:59,506
NIMROD KAMER: Me, neither.


34
0:0:59,506 --> 0:1:2,78
Hey, I'm the son of the Iranian
director [INAUDIBLE].


35
0:1:2,78 --> 0:1:5,76
Can you take me to
the Excelsior?


36
0:1:5,76 --> 0:1:10,53
Guys, can anyone take
my photo for a sec?


37
0:1:10,53 --> 0:1:13,84
I am the son of one
of the jury.


38
0:1:13,84 --> 0:1:15,9
Yeah, my father is
in the jury.


39
0:1:15,9 --> 0:1:23,43



40
0:1:23,43 --> 0:1:26,71
Somehow they had given me
full accreditation.


41
0:1:26,71 --> 0:1:30,78
I thought I might as well
do a press conference.


42
0:1:30,78 --> 0:1:57,27



43
0:1:57,27 --> 0:1:58,82
NIMROD KAMER: It was imperative
that I make more


44
0:1:58,82 --> 0:2:3,41
friends with large IMDB pages,
and I have long believed that


45
0:2:3,41 --> 0:2:6,284
blackmail can be a great
ice breaker.


46
0:2:6,284 --> 0:2:10,9
I have your sex tape,
by the way.


47
0:2:10,9 --> 0:2:11,78
He was just a friend of mine.


48
0:2:11,78 --> 0:2:12,3
Don't hurt me.


49
0:2:12,3 --> 0:2:12,96
Don't touch me.


50
0:2:12,96 --> 0:2:15,88
Pierce Bros' PA escorted me
to his private suite for a


51
0:2:15,88 --> 0:2:18,522
one-on-one screening of
his illicit sex tape.


52
0:2:18,522 --> 0:2:24,43



53
0:2:24,43 --> 0:2:27,45
I took off with his two
gorgeous nieces.


54
0:2:27,45 --> 0:2:29,99
Later that night, we pierced
each other without protection.


55
0:2:29,99 --> 0:4:29,99
