###0 GREG KROAH-HARTMAN: Good afternoon.
###1 Thanks everybody for coming, also all the remote sites.
###5 So we will kick off the Quantum AI speaker series.
###9 And we are very pleased and honored that we have an
###13 illustrous guest, John Preskill, who will kick off
###16 the speaker series.
###18 John is actually based across town and has been at Caltech,
###23 where he's the Richard Feynman Professor.
###26 He's there since '83.
###28 And previously, he got his PhD. from Harvard.
###32 So until the mid-90's, he did more like traditional physics,
###37 cosmology, elementary particles.
###40 But then switched to quantum information and started IQI,
###44 the Institute for Quantum information at Caltech, where
###48 many interesting results were achieved.
###52 And in his career, I think he had 45 PhDs and 40 post-docs.
###57 And I think this room here is becoming testimony to it
###62 because we are surrounded by Preskill
###66 post-docs and then PhDs.
###68 And Sergio on our team learned from John.
###71 So it definitely left his mark on the field of quantum
###74 information.
###76 And then just a few days ago, I was told was that when John
###82 has a guest who gives a talk, then he is being introduced
###85 with a poem.
###86 And I thought oh, my god, that's high bar.
###89 But fortunately, Dave Bacon on our team came through and he
###93 put a little limerick together to announce John.
###96 So I will try this.
###98 There was once a physicist named John, who threw qubits
###102 into the beyond.
###104 Across the horizon they went.
###106 But were they really spent or destined to
###109 become Hawking radiation?
###111 So I approve.
###114 I confess Dave's is a very geeky limerick, even for
###118 Google standards.
###119 But maybe the last thing I should say about John, I had
###123 the pleasure to witness his birthday symposium, which was
###127 just a few months ago.
###128 And that was quite a sight.
###130 There was a lot of highly decorated physicists, from
###134 Nobel Prize winners to winners of the
###136 fundamental prize of physics.
###138 And yeah, I was surrounded by the worldly leaders of
###142 physicists.
###142 And he's highly respected among them.
###145 So I'm very happy that you are going to give the first talk
###148 in the series.
###149 John.
###150 
###157 JOHN PRESKILL: Can you hear me OK?
###159 Thanks a lot, Hartman.
###161 And good job on the reading of the limerick.
###165 Thank you, Dave.
###166 I haven't been introduced by a limerick before, as I recall.
###170 This is going to be a talk about quantum physics.
###173 But it's also to some extent about technology.
###178 Now, you guys know more about technology than I do.
###181 I have this laptop I think it's pretty cool.
###184 And we all recognize, I'm sure you more than I, that
###188 technology that seems impressive to us now is going
###191 to be replaced by the end of the century by new technology
###195 that we can't really expect to imagine at this stage.
###200 But it's fun to think about future technologies.
###205 I may not be the best qualified to do that because
###208 unlike many of you, I am not an engineer.
###213 I'm a theoretical physicist.
###215 And maybe I'm not especially knowledgeable about how
###219 computers work.
###220 But as a physicist, I know that the crowning intellectual
###224 achievement of the past century has been the
###228 development of quantum theory.
###229 So it's natural to wonder about how the development of
###232 quantum theory in the 20th century is going to impact
###236 21st century technologies and in particular information
###243 technology.
###243 Now, quantum theory is over 100 years old.
###247 But there are some ways in which classical and quantum
###249 systems differ that we are really only appreciating
###254 deeply in the last couple of years.
###256 And those properties have to do with information encoded in
###259 physical systems.
###261 To a physicist, information is something that we can encode
###264 and store in the state of some physical system like
###268 the pages of a book.
###269 But fundamentally, all physical systems are really
###273 quantum systems governed by quantum physics.
###275 So information is something that we can encode and store
###279 in a quantum system.
###282 And information carried by quantum systems has some
###285 famously counter-intuitive properties.
###288 So physicists like to speak about the
###292 weirdness of quantum theory.
###294 And we relish that weirdness and take great delight in it.
###299 But more recently, we're asking more seriously whether
###302 it's possible to put that weirdness to work to exploit
###306 unusual properties of quantum information, to perform tasks
###310 that wouldn't be possible if this were a less weird,
###314 classical world.
###316 And that desire to put weirdness to work has driven
###319 the emergence of a field we call
###321 quantum information science.
###323 Which from my perspective, derives a lot of its
###327 intellectual vitality from three main ideas, quantum
###331 entanglement, quantum computing, and quantum error
###334 correction.
###335 And my goal in the talk is to introduce you to these ideas,
###338 if you're not already familiar with them.
###341 So starting at the beginning, we know that we can express
###345 classical information in terms of bits, where we might think
###349 of a bit as an object like a ball that, can be either one
###353 or two colors say red or green.
###355 And if I want to, I can store a bit in a box.
###359 And then later on if I open the box, the color ball I put
###362 in comes out again.
###363 So we can recover a bit and read it.
###366 Quantum information, too, can be expressed in terms of
###369 indivisible units, what we call quantum bits or qubits.
###375 And for many purposes, it's useful to think of a qubit as
###379 an object stored in a box.
###381 But where now, we can open the box in two complementary ways,
###385 two different ways to prepare or observe
###388 the state of a qubit.
###389 And if I put information in door number one or door number
###394 two, then later on I can open the same door again and the
###399 color that I put in will come out of the box, just like it
###402 were a classical bit.
###404 But if I say store information in door number one and then
###407 later on open a complementary door, door number two, then
###411 it's unpredictable what we'll find.
###413 It has probability one-half of being red, probability
###416 one-half of being green.
###419 So if you're going to observe quantum information, you have
###422 to do it the right way.
###423 If you do it in the wrong way, you'll actually damage the
###426 information.
###427 
###429 And one reason why that's important is appreciated if we
###432 think about copying quantum states.
###435 If I had a quantum copying machine, that would mean that
###438 if I happened to have put information in door number one
###441 of a qubit, I could make a copy.
###444 And then I could open door number one of the original and
###446 the duplicate and out of both I would find the
###449 color that I put in.
###451 Or if I put information in door number two of the qubit,
###454 I could make a copy and open door number two on the
###457 original and the duplicate.
###459 And the color that I had put in would
###460 come out of both boxes.
###462 But, in fact, there is no such machine.
###465 A machine that copies unknown quantum states is not allowed
###469 by the rules of quantum mechanics.
###472 And the reason is that to copy what's inside the box, the
###476 machine has to probe what's inside.
###479 And if it opens the right door, the door that I used,
###481 then it can copy the information, no problem, just
###483 as though it were classical.
###485 But if it opens the wrong door, it will damage the
###487 information.
###488 And at that point, it won't be possible to make a high
###490 fidelity copy.
###492 So although we might be able to clone a sheep, we can't
###496 clone a qubit.
###496 We can't copy unknown quantum states.
###501 Now, there are lots of possible physical
###503 realizations of qubits.
###504 I'm going to mention a couple of others
###506 later on in the talk.
###507 But just so you'll have something concrete to think
###510 about for the moment, you can imagine a single photon or
###513 particle of light which has an electric field.
###516 And that electric field can be oriented either horizontally
###520 or vertically, corresponding to observing our qubit through
###525 door number one and seeing two possibilities.
###528 Or we can imagine observing it in these
###530 45-degree rotated axes.
###532 And that corresponds to opening door number two, the
###534 complementary door, to observe the qubit.
###539 The really interesting differences between classical
###542 and quantum information arise only when we consider systems
###545 with more than one part.
###547 So suppose we have two qubits.
###549 They can be far apart from one another.
###551 One is at Caltech, in Pasadena.
###554 The other is in the custody of my friend, far away in the
###558 Andromeda galaxy.
###560 But a long time ago when these two qubits were both on Earth
###563 and could interact with one another, they were prepared in
###565 a particular state with some interesting properties.
###568 Namely, I can open my box in Pasadena and open it through
###574 either door number one or door number two.
###576 And either way, what comes out of the box is random, has
###580 probability one-half of being either red or green.
###583 And the same thing is true for my friend in Andromeda.
###585 He can open either box and either way sees a random bit.
###590 So neither one of us by opening his box can acquire
###594 any information.
###596 It just generates a random bit.
###598 And that's kind of surprising because with two boxes, we
###601 ought to have been able to store two bits of information.
###606 So where is that information hidden?
###608 The answer for this particular state of the two boxes is that
###612 all the information is actually encoded in the
###614 correlations between the two boxes.
###617 For this particular state, if my friend and I both open door
###621 number one, we're guaranteed to find the same color.
###624 It could be red, could be green.
###625 But we always find the same one if we open the same door.
###628 And likewise, if we both open door number two, we always
###631 find the same color, probability one-half of being
###634 red, probability one-half of being green.
###636 But it's guaranteed to be the same if we open the same door.
###639 And there are four distinguishable ways in which
###644 a box in Pasadena could be correlated
###646 with a box in Andromeda.
###647 We could either see the same bit or opposite bits when we
###652 both open door number one or we both open door number two.
###656 We've chosen one of those four ways.
###658 So that's two bits of information
###660 stored in the boxes.
###661 But what's unusual is the information is locally
###665 inaccessible.
###666 We can't acquire any of that information by looking at the
###668 boxes one at a time.
###671 And that property of quantum information, that it can be
###674 stored nonlocally, shared between two distantly
###678 separated systems, is what we call quantum entanglement.
###681 And that's the really central, essential way in with quantum
###685 information is different from classical information.
###690 Correlations themselves are not such an unusual thing.
###693 We encounter them all the time in daily life.
###696 I normally wear two socks that are the same color.
###699 It means that if you look at my left foot, then you know
###702 for sure what color to expect when you
###706 look at my right foot.
###707 Yeah, Hartman just tried it.
###708 It worked.
###710 And that's a correlation.
###714 And you might say it's kind of similar with the boxes.
###718 If I want to see what my friend is going to see when he
###724 opens store number one in Andromeda, I can open door
###728 number one in Pasadena.
###729 If I want to know what my friend is going to see when he
###732 opens door number two, I can open door number two.
###735 So aren't the boxes are really just like the socks?
###738 No, they're really different.
###740 There's a big difference between this quantum
###741 correlation and classical correlation.
###744 An essential difference is there's just one way
###747 to look at a sock.
###748 But we have these two complementary ways of looking
###751 at a qubit, of opening a quantum box.
###753 And that means that the correlations among qubits are
###758 richer and more interesting than correlations among
###761 classical bits.
###763 This phenomenon of quantum entanglement is an old thing.
###766 It was discussed quite explicitly by Einstein in a
###771 famous 1935 paper, with two collaborators.
###775 And to Einstein, quantum entanglement was so unsettling
###779 as to indicate that something is missing from our current
###782 understanding of the quantum description of nature.
###787 And that paper induced some interesting responses,
###791 including one from Schrodinger later that year, which was
###794 especially insightful.
###797 And Schrodinger described entanglement this way.
###799 He said the best possible knowledge of a whole does not
###803 necessarily include the best possible
###805 knowledge of its parts.
###807 What he meant was that even if we know exactly how those two
###811 boxes were prepared, know everything about those two
###814 boxes, we are still helpless to predict what will be found
###817 when we open one of the boxes in Pasadena or Andromeda.
###821 And it was Schrodinger who suggested, using the word
###824 "entanglement" or "entangled" to describe that situation.
###829 He also said it's discomforting that the theory
###831 should allow a system to be steered or piloted into one or
###836 the other type of state at the experimenter's mercy, in spite
###839 of his having no access to it.
###842 Schrodinger meant isn't it odd that it's up to me to decide
###845 by opening door number one or door number two whether I will
###848 know what my friend will see when he opens door number one
###852 or door number two?
###853 But Schrodinger also understood that these
###856 correlations don't enable us to send a message from
###860 Pasadena to Andromeda instantaneously.
###863 No matter what I do, my friend opens either door number one
###867 or door number two and just finds a random bit, learning
###869 nothing about what I did and receiving no
###872 information from me.
###874 Now, this phenomenon or idea of quantum entanglement did
###879 not advance very much for 30 years after that.
###883 Until the mid-'60s, when John Bell started us thinking about
###888 quantum entanglement in a rather different way.
###890 Not just as something weird, but something potentially
###894 useful, a resource that we can use to do things.
###898 Specifically, Bell described games that two players can
###902 play, Alice and Bob.
###904 It's a cooperative game.
###906 Alice and Bob are on the same side.
###907 They're both trying to win.
###909 The way the game works is that Alice and Bob receive inputs
###913 and they are to produce outputs which are correlated
###915 in a certain way, depending on the inputs that they receive.
###919 And if they receive some correlated bits before the
###923 game began, they're allowed to consult those correlated bits.
###927 But under the rules of the game, Alice and Bob cannot
###930 communicate between the time that they receive the inputs
###933 and the time that they produce their output.
###936 And for this particular game, if they play the best possible
###940 strategy, they can win with a probability of success 3/4,
###946 averaged over the inputs that they could receive, if we
###949 assume they're uniformly distributed.
###952 But there's a quantum version of the game.
###954 It's the same game.
###955 But now, Alice and Bob are permitted to use entangled
###959 qubits that were distributed before the game began.
###963 And by making use of that entanglement, they can play a
###965 better quantum strategy and win the game with a higher
###969 success probability, above 85%.
###973 So the quantum correlations are good for something.
###975 They allow you to win this game with higher probability.
###980 And experimental physicists have been playing the game for
###982 decades now and they keep winning with this higher
###985 probability of success that Bell showed us is possible in
###990 quantum physics.
###991 So these quantum correlations, stronger than classical
###993 correlations, really do seem to be part of
###996 the way nature behaves.
###999 Now, to Einstein quantum entanglement was kind of
###1004 disgusting.
###1005 And he called it spooky action at a distance
###1008 in a derisive tone.
###1009 This sounds even more derisive when you say it in German.
###1014 But it doesn't matter in physics what
###1016 Einstein things, right?
###1018 Nature is the way experiments reveal her to be.
###1022 And we have to learn to love her as she is.
###1026 Quantum entanglement is really part of the world.
###1030 OK.
###1030 So in a world with quantum correlations, we can use those
###1034 correlations to do things that we wouldn't be able to do if
###1037 all correlations were classical.
###1039 Boxes are not like socks.
###1041 You can win a game with a probability of
###1042 85% instead of 75%.
###1046 Is that really a big deal?
###1048 Yeah.
###1049 This is a really, really big deal.
###1051 And to appreciate why it's a big deal, we really should
###1054 think about systems with many parts.
###1058 Now suppose, for example, that I have a book.
###1062 It's 100 pages long.
###1064 It consists of a hundred subsystems, each a page.
###1068 If it were a classical book rather, with bits printed on
###1070 every page, you could read a single page and you'd know 1%
###1076 of the content of the book.
###1078 10 pages, you'd know 10% of the content of the book.
###1082 But suppose it's a highly entangled quantum book.
###1086 Then if you look at the pages one at a time, what you see is
###1088 really just random gibberish, which tells you nothing about
###1091 the content of the book, if it's a highly entangled book.
###1095 If you want to distinguish one entangled quantum book from
###1098 another, you can't tell the difference by looking at the
###1101 pages one at a time because the information isn't printed
###1104 on individual pages.
###1106 Almost all the information is encoded in the correlations
###1109 among the pages.
###1110 If you want to distinguish one such book from another, you
###1113 have to make a difficult collective observation on many
###1116 pages at once, perhaps more than half the
###1119 pages in the book.
###1121 If I have a quantum system consisting of qubits, and a
###1125 rather modest number of qubits, just a few hundred, if
###1129 I wanted to give a complete description of all the ways in
###1132 which those qubits are correlated with one another, I
###1135 would have to write down a huge amount of classical
###1138 information, more bits than the number of atoms in the
###1140 visible universe.
###1142 It will never be possible, even in principle, to write a
###1144 description like that down.
###1146 There's too much classical information to describe this
###1150 extravagant correlation of just a few hundred qubits.
###1154 And that property of quantum information, that we can't
###1156 hope to describe it using classical information, was
###1161 intriguing in particular to the Caltech
###1163 physicist Richard Feynman.
###1165 And it led Feynman to make the suggestion in the early 1980s
###1170 that if we could process quantum bits instead of
###1173 classical bits, operate a scalable quantum computer,
###1177 we'd be able to perform tasks that would be beyond the
###1181 capability of any conceivable digital computer.
###1184 So Feynman's idea was that if we can't even write down in
###1188 terms of classical bits the state of a few hundred qubits,
###1192 then perhaps by processing the qubits, we'd be able to
###1195 perform a task that we can't emulate with
###1198 ordinary digital computers.
###1201 When Feynman was making this suggestion in the early 1980s,
###1205 there was an undergraduate at Caltech, concentrating in
###1208 mathematics, named Peter Shor.
###1211 And Shor, like all Caltech undergraduates, had to take
###1215 our core curriculum.
###1216 Everybody at Caltech has to learn quantum mechanics, even
###1220 if you major in music.
###1221 We don't have a lot of music majors.
###1223 Everybody has to learn quantum mechanics when you're a
###1225 sophomore and Peter did.
###1226 And as far as I know, that was the most advanced class in
###1230 physics that he took.
###1231 But like many Caltech undergraduates, he remembered
###1235 what he learned as a sophomore about quantum physics.
###1238 And he drew upon that knowledge about 13 years later
###1244 to make an amazing discovery.
###1248 Shor, in 1994, realized that if you could build a quantum
###1251 computer, it would be able to solve certain problems like
###1255 finding the prime factors of large composite integers very,
###1261 very quickly.
###1262 That for a quantum computer, factoring would not be much
###1266 harder than multiplying numbers together.
###1270 And when I first heard about this, as Hartman said in the
###1272 introduction, this was in 1994, I didn't know much about
###1276 computer science or cryptography.
###1277 I was working on particle physics, and cosmology, and
###1282 gravitational physics.
###1284 But as soon as I heard about this, I was
###1286 really amazed and stunned.
###1287 Because I understood the implications are quite
###1290 remarkable.
###1291 That the boundary between hard problems and easy problems,
###1295 the problems that we should be able to solve some day with
###1298 advanced technologies versus the problems that we never any
###1301 hope of solving, that boundary is different than it otherwise
###1305 would be because this is a quantum world instead of a
###1308 classical world.
###1309 I thought it was one of the most interesting things I had
###1311 ever heard in my scientific life.
###1313 And it lead me eventually to change the direction of my own
###1317 research toward quantum
###1318 information and quantum computing.
###1320 Just to clarify what I'm talking about, I'm talking
###1322 about the scaling of the resources that we need to
###1325 solve the problem.
###1327 A hard factoring problem nowadays is
###1329 factoring 193 digits.
###1332 That's been done by a network of a few hundred workstations
###1337 collaborating over the internet in a few months.
###1340 But from what we know about the scaling of the best
###1342 classical algorithms for factoring, if that same
###1346 hardware were used to try to factor a 500-digit number, it
###1350 would take longer than the age of the universe.
###1353 So that's not something that we expect to happen, factoring
###1356 500-digit numbers in the very near future
###1358 with classical computers.
###1361 Now, let's imagine that I have a quantum computer with the
###1363 same clock speed as that classical computer.
###1366 It can perform the same number of basic operations per second
###1370 as the classical computer, but now on qubits instead of bits.
###1374 And then we would be able to factor, using Shor's
###1376 algorithm, the 193-digit number in about a tenth of a
###1380 second and the 500-digit number in two seconds.
###1383 Now, there's a completely different scaling of the
###1385 resources we need with the size of the input to the
###1388 problem when we run Shor's algorithm.
###1392 But who cares about factoring?
###1393 People do care about factoring because the presumed
###1396 difficulty of factoring is the basis of widely used, public,
###1402 key cryptography schemes.
###1404 There are other problems that quantum computers can break
###1407 which are alternative ways of doing public key.
###1410 When quantum computers are widely available, we won't be
###1414 able to protect our privacy in the same way that we're doing
###1417 it now using current public key schemes.
###1420 Alternatives exist.
###1421 But it's still not exactly clear how we will best protect
###1425 our privacy in the post-quantum world.
###1428 That's a ongoing subject of discussion.
###1432 But the more important thing, more broadly, that we learn
###1435 from Peter Shor's algorithm is that there's an interesting
###1439 classification of problems.
###1440 There are problems which are classically hard
###1444 and quantumly easy.
###1445 Problems that we can't solve with reasonable scaling of
###1448 resources with classical computers, but which we can
###1451 with quantum computers.
###1452 And so it becomes an urgent question, what lies in that
###1456 intermediate region that's quantumly easy
###1459 and classically hard?
###1462 And we still have a lot to learn about that I think.
###1464 We do know that quantum computers have limitations.
###1467 They can't speed up everything.
###1469 It seems that spectacular speedups are possible only for
###1474 problems with a special structure.
###1476 And in particular, we don't think that quantum computers
###1478 can dramatically speed up problems which are
###1482 NP-complete, the hardest problems for which we can
###1485 efficiently verify the solution
###1486 with a classical computer.
###1488 In the worst case, we can't do much better than brute force
###1491 search for the answer in that case.
###1493 Quantum computers can speed up brute force searching, but not
###1497 exponentially, only quadratically, a more
###1499 modest speed up.
###1502 It's important to keep in mind though that quantum computers
###1504 can also solve problems that are not in NP, problems where
###1507 we can't check the answer with a classical computer.
###1510 And indeed, the most natural application for quantum
###1514 computers is to simulate the time evolution of quantum
###1517 systems with many particles, many parts, which might be of
###1521 interest in chemistry or in the quantum field theories
###1525 that physicists use to describe elementary particles.
###1528 So, for example, we can ask about the type of problem that
###1532 I as a particle physicist used to worry about.
###1535 Suppose we want to consider a high energy collision between
###1538 particles and we'd like to be able to sample accurately from
###1541 the possible states of many particles that could be
###1545 produced in that high energy collision.
###1548 And at least in some cases, we've shown that that
###1552 simulation can be done with efficient scaling of resources
###1555 on a quantum computer, which we don't believe is the case
###1558 classically.
###1560 So it may be that a quantum computer is capable of
###1563 simulating efficiently any quantum process that can occur
###1566 in nature, though that's still an open question, in
###1569 particular with regard to processes in which both
###1573 quantum mechanics and gravity are important.
###1577 So quantum computers would have wonderful capabilities.
###1581 We'd love to have them.
###1582 Lots of people around the world are
###1584 working on quantum computing.
###1586 So why don't we have them already?
###1588 What's the big delay?
###1590 Well, it's really, really, really hard.
###1594 And part of what makes it hard is that quantum systems are
###1598 more susceptible to error, to the damaging effects of noise,
###1603 than classical systems.
###1605 Physicists sometimes like to speak about a quantum state of
###1609 a cat, which is a superposition of the live and
###1613 dead state of a cat, or in this case, the more human
###1616 case, of a awake and sleeping cat.
###1620 Now, we never observe in our everyday lives that kind of
###1625 superposition of macroscopically
###1627 distinguishable states.
###1629 And we understand why that's the case.
###1631 Because no real cat can be perfectly isolated from its
###1635 surroundings.
###1637 And the interactions with the environment very quickly in
###1641 effect measure the cat, projecting it onto a state
###1644 which is either completely alive or completely dead.
###1646 That's a process that we call decoherence.
###1650 And decoherence is actually very important for helping us
###1653 understand why classical physics works so well.
###1656 Why, when we consider macroscopic systems, we don't
###1659 usually have to worry about quantum phenomena.
###1663 It's because decoherence is extremely
###1664 fast for big systems.
###1668 Now, a quantum computer, when we manage to build one, may
###1672 not be much like a cat.
###1674 But it will, like a cat, inevitably interact at some
###1678 level with its environment.
###1680 There will be decoherence.
###1681 And so the quantum computer will crash unless we can find
###1685 some way of fighting off decoherence, of preventing
###1690 sources of error from making the quantum computer fail.
###1694 
###1697 Errors are a problem, even in the classical
###1699 world, as we all know.
###1701 I have many bits that I cherish and I
###1704 would hate to lose.
###1705 And everywhere, there are dragons lurking, who take
###1709 delight in tampering with those bits and flipping them
###1712 from red to green, or whatever.
###1714 But we know ways of protecting ourselves from the dragons.
###1717 We can encode information redundantly.
###1720 So that if I have a bit that I want to be sure to keep, I
###1724 can, for example, store backup copies of the bit.
###1728 That's an example of a simple code, which can be used to
###1732 protect against errors.
###1733 The dragon might come along and flip the color
###1736 of one of the balls.
###1738 But as long as the dragon hasn't had a chance to
###1740 interact with more than one ball, I can employ a busy
###1743 beaver of the sort we have many of at Caltech.
###1747 And we can ask the beaver, if he sees the one ball is a
###1750 different color than the others, to recolor that ball
###1753 so that all three match.
###1755 And so as long as only one of the balls has been damaged, we
###1759 can recover the original encoded state and protect
###1762 against errors.
###1763 So we'd like to use the same concept of protecting
###1766 information from error through redundant storage in the
###1770 quantum world.
###1771 But there are some potential obstacles.
###1774 As we've already discussed, we can't copy
###1778 unknown quantum states.
###1779 So I can't take the state of a quantum computer and store a
###1782 backup copy in case the original gets damaged.
###1787 And there are more things that can go wrong with quantum
###1789 information than with classical information.
###1793 It could be that the dragon will come along and open door
###1795 number one of a qubit and flip the color of the ball and
###1798 reclose the box.
###1799 That would be like a bit flip that occurs
###1801 in a classical bit.
###1804 But it's also possible that the dragon could open door
###1806 number two and change the color of the ball.
###1809 That's what we call a phase error in quantum information.
###1813 It really has no analog in the classical world.
###1817 And there's another way of thinking
###1818 about these phase errors.
###1820 Another way a phase error, an error through door number two
###1823 could occur, would be for a dragon to open door number
###1827 one, look at the color of the ball, and not flip the color,
###1831 but just remember the color, make a record of
###1833 what the color is.
###1835 And that record will damage the information if we try to
###1838 look at the qubit through the door number two.
###1841 And in many physical situations, it's easier to
###1843 remember or record the value of a bit than to flip a bit.
###1848 And that means these phase errors are particularly
###1851 pervasive and hard to avoid in many
###1855 types of physical systems.
###1856 
###1860 In fact, if we want to resist decoherence, it means we have
###1864 to somehow prevent the environment from learning
###1866 about the state of the quantum computer during the course of
###1869 the computation.
###1870 If some record is left behind of what the intermediate state
###1874 of the quantum computer was, that will cause the quantum
###1877 computer to fail.
###1879 If a quantum computation was successful, then it should be
###1883 that if you ask the quantum computer after its done, what
###1886 did you just do while you were factoring that huge number, it
###1890 should always answer I forget because no record was left
###1894 behind of the state of the computer at
###1897 intermediate times.
###1899 So we really need to do a kind of secret computation,
###1902 completely sealed off from the surroundings if we want a
###1905 quantum computer to succeed.
###1907 When we're done with the computation and we have the
###1909 result, it's OK to broadcast that to the world and tell
###1912 everyone what the answer is.
###1914 But we can't have any record left behind of the state of
###1917 the quantum computer during the course of the computation
###1920 because that will cause the computation to fail.
###1923 So we have to figure out a way to encrypt the processing that
###1926 we're doing.
###1928 And really our enemy here is entanglement.
###1930 It is entanglement between our quantum computer and its
###1933 environment, which drives decoherence.
###1936 And the way to fight off that entanglement is to use
###1939 entanglement to our advantage, to store information in a
###1943 highly entangled state.
###1945 If I want to store one logical qubit, it is possible to do
###1949 that if I have five physical qubits, in such a way that if
###1954 the dragon comes along and looks at one of those five
###1957 qubits, the dragon can't acquire any information about
###1962 what the logical state is of the qubit by
###1965 looking at that one box.
###1967 This is just like the 100-page book I described earlier.
###1970 The state of the five qubits is highly entangled.
###1973 So if you want to know what the information is stored in
###1976 that five-qubit book, you can't learn that information
###1979 by looking at a single qubit.
###1981 It's not there.
###1982 It's in the correlations among the qubits.
###1985 And we can again ask the beaver to help us out.
###1988 After the dragon has done something, and we don't know
###1991 what, we can ask the beaver to make some kind of collective
###1994 observation on the five qubits, which we can do with
###1997 the quantum computer.
###1998 And from that information learn, not the state of the
###2001 logical qubit that we're trying to protect.
###2003 We don't want anyone, even the beaver, to know what that is.
###2007 But what damage has occurred, which of the boxes has been
###2009 damaged, what needs to be done to repair the damage.
###2012 And then the beaver can reinstate the original encoded
###2016 state, if only one of the qubits has been damaged.
###2019 So that's the principle of quantum error correction.
###2024 And how do we actually get this to work?
###2026 Well, we'll see.
###2029 But one hero of the story is my colleague, Alexei Kitaev.
###2037 I first met Alexei in 1997, on his first visit to the US.
###2042 He came to Caltech and gave a talk on the first day we met.
###2046 And I made these notes.
###2048 And it was really one of the most exciting days of my
###2052 scientific life to talk to Kitaev that way because I
###2055 learned from him an idea which I felt could potentially be
###2060 transformative about quantum error correction.
###2063 And what I learned from Kitaev is the connection between
###2066 error correction and topology.
###2069 "Topology" is the word mathematicians use if they
###2072 want to describe properties of objects that remain invariant
###2076 when we smoothly deform the object without tearing it.
###2081 And likewise, we would like the way a quantum computer
###2084 processes protected information to remain
###2088 invariant when we deform the computer by
###2092 introducing some noise.
###2094 So we'd like to make use of physical interactions that
###2097 have topological features.
###2099 Physicists have known about such
###2101 interactions for a long time.
###2103 For example, I can consider an electron interacting with a
###2108 magnetic flux tube.
###2109 And if that electron is carried around the flux tube,
###2112 even though it never penetrates inside to interact
###2115 directly with the magnetic field, the quantum state of
###2119 the electron will be modified.
###2122 And that modification is really a topological property.
###2125 It stays the same if we deform the
###2127 trajectory of the electron.
###2129 The only thing that matters is the winding number of the
###2131 electron around the flux tube.
###2135 There are more exotic types of topological interactions that
###2139 can occur in two-dimensional media, where there are
###2143 point-like particles which we call anyons.
###2146 Non-abelian anyons in particular have the property
###2149 that I can consider a system of many of these particles in
###2152 a two-dimensional media.
###2154 And there are lots of quantum states we can construct of
###2158 these many anyons, a number of states which are all
###2162 distinguishable, which is exponential in
###2164 the number of particles.
###2166 But all of these quantum states locally look the same.
###2169 We can't see any of the information that distinguishes
###2172 one state from another by looking at the
###2174 particles one at a time.
###2176 OK.
###2177 The environment might interact with the
###2179 particles one at a time.
###2180 But that doesn't allow any information about the encoded
###2183 state to leak to the environment.
###2186 And we can process the information just by performing
###2189 exchanges of the particles, having particles swap places
###2193 to get a different quantum state, which can be a logical
###2197 operation in a quantum computer.
###2200 So we can imagine operating a topological quantum computer,
###2205 that's what I learned from Kitaev in 1997, which we could
###2208 initialize by preparing pairs of these particles in the
###2213 two-dimensional medium, anyons.
###2216 And then process information by performing a sequence of
###2219 exchanges or swaps of the particles, so that their world
###2224 lines in 2 plus 1 dimensional space-time trace out a braid
###2228 in that three-dimensional space.
###2231 And then we can read out the information at the end by, for
###2236 example, bringing the particles together pairwise
###2239 and observing whether they disappear, whether they
###2241 annihilate or not.
###2244 And what makes this idea beautiful is that the
###2247 computation is intrinsically resistant to decoherence.
###2251 If we keep the temperature low so there are a lot of stray
###2254 anyons wandering around, if we keep the anyons far apart from
###2258 one another, except at the very beginning when we create
###2260 the pairs and the very end when we annihilate the pairs,
###2264 then there's no way for the information that's being
###2267 processed to leak to the environment.
###2270 And if we perform the right braid, we'll
###2273 get the right answer.
###2275 So it's topologically protected quantum computation.
###2280 So that looks pretty good to a theorist.
###2283 But how are we actually going to build the system that has
###2285 such non-abelian anyons that could be the basis of the
###2289 hardware for a quantum computer?
###2291 Well, here we can make use of another idea which Kitaev and
###2295 others have developed, a trick for cutting electrons in half.
###2301 You can think about it this way.
###2303 We can imagine a wire which is superconducting.
###2306 "Superconducting" means the wire conducts electricity
###2309 without any resistance.
###2312 And there are really two types of superconducting conducting
###2314 wires, what we call conventional or ordinary
###2316 superconductors and something called a topological
###2319 superconductor.
###2321 And at the boundary between these two types of
###2322 superconductivity sits an object we
###2325 call a Mayorana fermion.
###2327 What's unusual about a topological superconductor is
###2331 that we can add one extra electron to this topological
###2335 superconductor and that electron dissolves and
###2337 disappears.
###2339 In so doing, it actually changes the state of this pair
###2342 of Mayorana fermions at the edge.
###2344 Now, each Mayorana fermion individually doesn't change in
###2348 any perceptible way.
###2350 But the pair of Mayorana fermions does.
###2352 And that can be used to store a qubit of information.
###2357 Experiments have been done to look for this effect.
###2359 They are not yet conclusive.
###2361 They'll have to be repeated and made more convincing.
###2365 But there are at least preliminary indications that
###2367 this type of a topological superconductivity in Mayorana
###2371 fermions can be realized in systems that experimental
###2374 physicists know how to build now using semiconductors and
###2378 superconductors.
###2380 Of course, we'd like to be able to process the
###2382 information by doing some kind of braiding of
###2384 these Mayorana fermions.
###2386 And that is in principle possible.
###2388 If we have a network of wires, we can manipulate the position
###2393 of a Mayorana fermion by adjusting some voltage gates,
###2396 which determines where the boundary is between
###2399 conventional and a topological superconductor.
###2402 So I can take one of the Mayorana fermions and park it
###2405 around the corner of a t-junction, move the first one
###2409 over to the left, and then unpark the other one.
###2412 And so if we've achieved an exchange of two Mayorana
###2414 fermions, that would be like an elementary logic gate in a
###2418 quantum computer.
###2419 So this type of experiment hasn't been done yet.
###2422 We're hopeful that it can be done in the
###2424 next couple of years.
###2426 And that would be a potential step towards building one type
###2429 of quantum hardware.
###2430 But apart from any technological implications, it
###2433 would be a real milestone for physics to realize this type
###2438 of exotic topological interaction between particles
###2442 in some system that physicists can control.
###2446 So I've talked about hardware.
###2448 I would like to mention that there are a variety of
###2450 different ways of developing hardware that are under
###2454 development, many of which look very interesting.
###2457 And in particular, it's timely to talk about ion-trap
###2461 technology because Dave Wineland's work in that area
###2466 was recognized by the most recent Nobel Prize in
###2469 physics last year.
###2471 Wineland and others have, over a couple of decades, developed
###2476 ion-trap technology.
###2477 They have the ability to store individual atoms, which have
###2481 an electron stripped off.
###2482 So they're electrically charged.
###2483 They're ions.
###2485 They can be stored with electromagnetic
###2486 fields for a long time.
###2489 And although each one is just an individual atom, we can
###2494 encode a qubit by imagining that each atom is either in
###2499 its lowest energy state, its ground state, or in some
###2502 long-lived, excited state.
###2504 And if I want to read out the state of the qubit, that's
###2506 actually pretty easy.
###2507 We can illuminate the ions with laser light.
###2512 And if we choose the frequency of the light suitably, then
###2516 the ions will remain dark it they're in the green
###2518 state of the qubit.
###2520 If they're in the red state, they will interact strongly
###2522 with the light and fluoresce.
###2524 So they'll glow visibly.
###2526 And we can read out a series of 0s and 1s that way, when
###2529 we're ready to read out our quantum computer.
###2532 But, of course, we want to do more than just read out.
###2534 We want to be able to process the information.
###2536 So we have to be able to perform logic
###2538 gates on pairs of qubits.
###2541 We've got to get the qubits to interact.
###2542 And in this case, we would use the electrostatic repulsion
###2546 between ions for that purpose.
###2549 We can do something like this.
###2550 I can pick out an ion in a trap and address it with a
###2554 pulse laser, choose the frequency and duration of that
###2557 laser pulse properly so that if the ion is in the red
###2560 state, nothing will happen.
###2562 If it's in the green state, the ion makes a transition
###2565 from the green to the red state.
###2567 And at the same time, because of those interactions, a
###2570 vibrational mode of all the ions in the trap is excited.
###2574 And then I can pick out another ion in the trap and
###2577 address it with the pulse laser, choose the frequency
###2580 and duration of that pulse in such a way that nothing will
###2583 happen if the ions are not vibrating.
###2585 But if they are vibrating, that ion will undergo a
###2588 transition from one state to the other and the
###2591 vibration will stop.
###2593 So what I've done is I've picked out
###2594 two ions in the trap.
###2596 And if the first ion had been red,
###2599 nothing would have happened.
###2600 If it's green, then both ions make a transition.
###2603 And so if I start out with a superposition of red and green
###2607 for the first ion, I get a correlated quantum state, an
###2610 entangled pair of qubits for the pair of ions.
###2613 And the quantum computation would consist of many such
###2616 steps, each one an entangling operation acting
###2619 on a pair of ions.
###2621 At least that cartoon is the way a theorist would describe
###2624 what goes on in Wineland's lab.
###2626 If you go to his lab at NIST in Boulder, Colorado and look
###2630 around, you're in for kind of a shock.
###2631 Because underlying that cartoon is a great deal of
###2635 technical complexity, which might make you pessimistic
###2639 about the prospects for scaling up ion traps to
###2642 thousands or millions of qubits.
###2645 Well, it's going to be very, very hard.
###2647 Wineland and others have an idea of how to do it.
###2651 But it looks very difficult.
###2654 We don't know whether that will succeed or not.
###2656 On the other hand, there are other ways of realizing qubits
###2658 physically, which are making rapid progress.
###2661 One makes use of superconductivity again, but
###2664 in a different way than I described in the case with
###2666 Mayorana fermions.
###2668 We can use superconducting wires to store quantum
###2670 information.
###2671 And although for practical reasons this isn't the best
###2674 way to do it, and you'll learn about better ways to do it
###2677 when John Martinez is here in a month or two, you can
###2684 visualize how we could store information by thinking of a
###2687 closed loop of superconducting wire with a
###2690 persistent current flowing.
###2692 And the current can flow either clockwise or
###2694 counterclockwise around the hoop.
###2695 Those are the two distinguishable
###2697 states of the qubit.
###2698 And what's remarkable about that encoding is that the
###2701 information is encoded in a collective state of billions
###2704 of electrons.
###2706 And yet, we can treat it like a single unit of quantum
###2710 information and protect it and manipulate it quite
###2713 accurately.
###2714 Another possibility is to use a single electron, which has a
###2717 magnetic field, a spin, where its north pole can be oriented
###2722 either up or down.
###2723 So that's a qubit.
###2724 And what's remarkable about that encoding is it's just one
###2727 little electron.
###2728 But yet we can address it, prepare its state, manipulate
###2733 its state, get two such qubits to interact with a good
###2737 accuracy using current technology.
###2738 And both of these technologies have been advancing
###2741 impressively in the last couple of years.
###2744 And there are a number of others, a number of other ways
###2746 that have been proposed and are under development for
###2750 proceeding with building quantum hardware.
###2752 And we just don't know at this stage which of these is going
###2754 to turn out.
###2755 Or maybe it'll be none of these and some other idea that
###2757 hasn't been proposed yet.
###2759 Each of these technologies has advantages and disadvantages.
###2762 Perhaps the systems of the future will use hybrid
###2766 technologies, where we combine together different types of
###2768 qubits so we can take advantage of the strong points
###2774 of each of these technologies.
###2775 
###2778 No matter how we build the hardware, we're going to have
###2781 to do error correction, as I described earlier.
###2783 And actually the best idea we have about how to do this
###2786 error correction in a reasonably efficient manner
###2790 goes back to these topological encodings of information that
###2793 I mentioned.
###2794 The best idea we have is that if you're going to use ions,
###2797 or electron spins, or superconducting circuits, you
###2801 can, by getting such systems to interact in a prescribed
###2804 way, make them behave like these topological media that I
###2808 described, that support anyons.
###2810 And so we can use that system to store
###2813 quantum information robustly.
###2816 But that will only work effectively if our gates are
###2820 good enough.
###2820 We have to have a low enough rate of error per gate in
###2824 order for these error correction ideas to
###2828 effectively protect a quantum computer against the damaging
###2831 effects of noise.
###2833 We would like the probability of error per gate to be
###2837 considerably less than 1% in order to have reasonably
###2841 efficient error correction schemes.
###2843 And the hardware is advancing and getting into that
###2846 interesting regime where we can do two qubit gates with
###2850 the required accuracy for quantum error
###2852 correction to be effective.
###2857 So how far do we have to go before we can build factoring
###2860 machines that can really outperform what can be done
###2865 with classical computers?
###2865 Well, let's say we want to break the RSA scheme as it's
###2869 usually implemented these days.
###2871 That means we have to factor a 2048-bit number.
###2875 Well, you know you can do that with a classical computer.
###2877 It's just question of resources.
###2880 John Martinez has done these estimates, which I'm
###2882 stealing from him.
###2884 If you want to factor a 2048-bit number, then you just
###2887 have to cover 1/4 of the land area of North America with a
###2891 server farm.
###2892 Now, that would cost about a million trillion dollars.
###2895 The power requirement would be about a million terawatts,
###2898 which is about 100,000 times the world's
###2901 power output today.
###2903 The bad news is you have to run the algorithm for 10 years
###2905 to get the answer and it would consume the world's supply of
###2908 fossil fuels in a day.
###2911 So what if you tried to do this with the existing quantum
###2914 technology, which Martinez has been a leader in developing?
###2919 Well, we just do it by brute force.
###2921 If we want to factor this number, we need something like
###2923 10,000 logical qubits, error-free qubits.
###2927 In order to achieve that, based on the types of error
###2930 rates that we think are achievable or nearly
###2933 achievable with the current technology, we would need
###2936 about 10 million physical qubits, keep them far enough
###2939 apart so we have lots of room to cool them
###2941 and bring in wires.
###2943 And then the current cost, Martinez estimates, of making
###2946 a really good qubit in his lab is about $10,000.
###2950 So we could get these 10 million physical qubits if we
###2954 were willing to spend a $100 billion.
###2957 And then we could run the algorithm in 16 hours.
###2961 It would consume 10 megawatts.
###2963 OK.
###2963 So actually this is a somewhat rosier outlook than maybe the
###2966 current situation because it's such a huge engineering
###2969 challenge to scale things out when we don't know
###2971 exactly how to do it.
###2973 But it indicates that we can imagine in coming decades that
###2978 this can really be a practical technology.
###2980 We've just got to bring the cost down a
###2982 bit, below $100 billion.
###2984 And you'll hear more about that from Martinez.
###2989 So there are three questions about quantum computers than
###2990 I've discussed so far.
###2992 Why do we want to build one?
###2993 Well, for one thing, because quantum computers would be
###2996 able, perhaps, to simulate any process that occurs in the
###2999 quantum world.
###3000 That could be important in chemistry, and material
###3003 science, and from a physicist's point of view, in
###3006 simulating exotic physical phenomenon, that particle
###3010 physicists like me, or like I used to be, care about.
###3014 Can we really build one?
###3015 Well, we don't know of an obstacle in principle that
###3018 will prevent us from succeeding, if we use these
###3021 principles of quantum correction, and we can make
###3023 the hardware good enough.
###3024 And as far as we can tell, it ought to work.
###3027 How are we going to do it?
###3028 That's still far from clear.
###3029 These different approaches to quantum hardware that I
###3034 quickly summarized for you are all being developed.
###3036 It's important that they all be developed.
###3038 Because we really don't know which is going to turn out, if
###3041 any of them, to be the best scalable technology.
###3046 But you know, I am not an engineer.
###3048 I'm a theoretical physicist.
###3049 So I get excited about the potential ways in which what
###3054 we're learning by thinking about quantum computing can be
###3057 applied to problems at the frontiers of physics.
###3062 And there are many applications of quantum
###3064 information processing to physics.
###3067 Many of them have to do with what we call the monogamy of
###3070 entanglement, a difference between classical and quantum
###3073 correlations that I haven't emphasized so much so far.
###3077 Classical correlations are polygamous.
###3080 They can be shared by many parties.
###3083 Adam and Betty both read the newspaper.
###3086 They have the same information.
###3088 They become correlated with one another.
###3090 And nothing prevents Charlie from
###3093 reading that same newspaper.
###3095 So now, all three of them are correlated.
###3096 And Charlie is just as strongly correlated with Betty
###3099 and with Adam, as Adam and Betty are with one another.
###3102 And the rest of us in the room can read the newspaper.
###3104 And everybody joins in on the correlation.
###3107 Quantum correlations are different.
###3109 We say they are monogamous.
###3111 They are harder to share.
###3113 If Adam and Betty are strongly entangled, if they are fully
###3117 entangled, as entangled as possible with one another,
###3121 then neither Adam nor Betty has the ability to be
###3124 correlated with any other system.
###3128 Likewise, if Betty is fully entangled with Charlie, then
###3132 Betty and Charlie cannot be correlated at all with Adam.
###3137 So that's what we mean when we say the entanglement is
###3140 monogamous.
###3141 It can be shared two ways.
###3144 And that monogamy can be frustrating because Betty
###3147 might want to be entangled with both Adam and Charlie.
###3151 But if she wants to entangle with Charlie, she has to
###3153 sacrifice some of her entanglement with Adam in
###3156 order to do so.
###3158 That feature, that monogamy of entanglement, has many
###3163 ramifications.
###3164 One is in quantum cryptography.
###3167 If Adam and Betty are nearly fully entangled with one
###3171 another, if they can verify they are very highly
###3174 entangled, for example by playing Bell's game and
###3178 winning, and then they will know that they have very
###3181 little correlation with anyone in the outside world who would
###3184 be a potential eavesdropper.
###3186 They can use their entanglement to generate a
###3188 secret key that they share, a random string of numbers that
###3192 Adam has and Betty has, but which the outside world knows
###3195 very little about.
###3196 And then with a little bit of processing, they can amplify
###3199 that privacy so that they are assured that the world outside
###3204 knows nothing about their key.
###3205 And they can safely use it to encrypt and decrypt a
###3208 classical message.
###3211 With information theoretic security, no attack by the
###3214 eavesdropper will succeed in breaking such a protocol.
###3219 Monogamy is very important in the study of quantum matter.
###3223 We might have a system of many electrons.
###3225 And the interactions among the electron make them want to
###3227 entangle with one another.
###3229 But if electron A is to entangle with electron B, then
###3232 it's going to give up some of its ability to entangle with
###3235 other electrons in the system that it
###3237 wants to entangle with.
###3238 And so the system will have to arrive at some compromise to
###3243 relieve that frustration, that inability to entangle with
###3247 many particles at once to the best degree possible.
###3250 And there are qualitatively different ways in which the
###3255 many-body state can find and entangled a state of matter,
###3259 which correspond to different phases of matter, that can't
###3262 be smoothly changed one to another.
###3265 Classifying the different phases of quantum matter is
###3268 really a problem in understanding the types of
###3270 entanglement that can be shared by many particles.
###3274 And monogamy is also important in the study of black hole
###3277 physics, which has been a subject that's been quite
###3280 active over the last year or so.
###3282 Let me just take a few minutes to tell you about
###3284 what's been going on.
###3286 Actually, we've known for a long time, nearly 40 years,
###3289 that black holes, although classically they are objects
###3292 from which nothing can escape, actually emit radiation
###3296 because of quantum effects.
###3297 We think a black hole, if it forms from a collapse of
###3301 matter, will eventually evaporate completely through
###3305 this emission of Hawking radiation.
###3309 And normally when systems get thermalized and behave like
###3313 they have some characteristic temperature and radiate, like
###3315 black holes do, we believe that such processes are
###3320 microscopically reversible.
###3322 In principle, they could be run backwards.
###3325 Information doesn't really get destroyed.
###3327 But it gets scrambled, put into a form which is
###3330 very hard to decode.
###3331 But which, in principle, can be decoded.
###3334 So we think, black holes, like other quantum systems, ought
###3337 not to destroy information, just scramble it, making it
###3341 hard to decode.
###3343 But black holes are different than other systems in an
###3345 important way.
###3345 They have a highly deformed geometry, which I've tried to
###3348 indicate here in this diagram.
###3350 Here, time is running upward.
###3352 This black line represents the event horizon, the boundary
###3357 between the outside and the inside of a black hole.
###3360 And this green line is a slice of constant time,
###3364 a space-like surface.
###3365 But just think of it as one particular time.
###3368 But because of the distorted geometry, it has
###3371 this unusual shape.
###3373 Which means that the collapsing matter from which
###3375 the black hole form, and most of the outgoing Hawking
###3379 radiation emitted as the black hole evaporates, are at the
###3382 same time, cross the single space-like slice.
###3386 And so if information really comes out of a black hole in a
###3389 highly scrambled form, it means information at the same
###3392 time is at two different places, inside the black hole
###3395 and outside.
###3395 But remember, I told you that we can't copy quantum
###3398 information.
###3399 So we're kind of stuck here.
###3401 If black holes don't destroy information, then it seems
###3404 that they are a quantum copying machine.
###3406 That they were able to clone a quantum state, taking the
###3409 information encoded in the collapsing matter and printing
###3412 it in this outgoing Hawking radiation.
###3414 And that caused great puzzlement.
###3416 But for about 20 years, we have had an idea about how the
###3420 situation is resolved, which is called black hole
###3425 complementarity.
###3426 It's a kind of crazy idea.
###3428 It is that we should not think of the outside system, the
###3435 Hawking radiation, and the inside system, the collapsing
###3438 matter, as two different parts of a big system.
###3442 We should think of them as two complementary ways of
###3446 describing the same system.
###3448 There's, so to speak, door number one and door number two
###3451 of black hole physics, two complementary descriptions of
###3454 the same system.
###3456 And that's not at all obvious.
###3459 And that we actually need to understand the black holes
###3463 better to clarify exactly why it occurs.
###3467 But the idea is that this isn't really cloning.
###3469 It's just we have two
###3470 descriptions of the same physics.
###3472 One is appropriate for someone who falls into the black hole,
###3475 the description of the information in
###3476 the collapsing body.
###3478 The other is appropriate for someone who stays outside.
###3481 That's the information imprinted
###3482 in the Hawking radiation.
###3484 This idea of a black hole complementarity is intended to
###3487 reconcile three beliefs which seem reasonable.
###3491 Black holes don't destroy information.
###3492 They merely scramble it.
###3495 Secondly, that an observer who falls through the horizon, the
###3499 boundary between inside and outside of a black hole,
###3501 doesn't notice anything unusual upon entering the
###3504 black hole.
###3506 Everything seems normal.
###3507 Until later on, when the party will inevitably be torn apart
###3511 by very strong gravitational forces, deep
###3514 inside the black hole.
###3516 And physics seems perfectly normal from the point of view
###3519 of someone who stays outside the black hole.
###3523 But what has recently been argued is that these three
###3526 things can't simultaneously be true.
###3529 And the problem is this.
###3531 That if we consider an old black hole, which has been
###3533 radiated for a long time, information is starting to
###3536 leak out of it we it evaporates.
###3538 That means that the recently emitted radiation, system B,
###3542 has to be highly entangled with radiation that was
###3545 emitted earlier, which I called system C.
###3548 But we also know that if a freely falling observer,
###3550 falling through the horizon, sees not a lot of particles,
###3553 but something that just looks like empty space, empty space
###3556 actually has a lot of entanglement between and
###3559 outside the black hole, B, and the region inside, A. So this
###3563 recently emitted radiation has to be highly entangled with
###3566 the inside of the black hole.
###3567 It also has to be highly entangled
###3569 with earlier radiation.
###3571 And that's a problem.
###3572 Because system B can't be highly entangled with both A
###3575 and C. That violates monogamy.
###3578 And so we're really confused about what this means.
###3580 What has been suggested is that we should give up on
###3584 assumption 2, that freely falling observers don't think
###3587 everything is smooth and nice and normal when they cross
###3591 from the outside to the inside in the black hole.
###3593 In fact, there is no inside.
###3595 And they just hit a seething firewall.
###3598 The singularity, where you get torn apart, is actually right
###3602 at the horizon.
###3604 That's the suggestion which has been promoted recently.
###3608 And it's crazy.
###3608 Because if you just solve the equations of general
###3612 relativity to see what the geometry of a black hole
###3614 should be, that's not what you find.
###3616 You find in fact the geometry should be very smooth as you
###3621 cross the horizon.
###3622 So we're really confused about this.
###3624 The reason I'm telling you about it is that this debate
###3627 could have occurred 20 years ago.
###3629 But it's occurring now I think because the gravitational
###3632 physicists and string theorists are more accustomed
###3635 now to thinking about their physical systems from the
###3638 point of view of quantum information and entanglement.
###3641 And that's a change which is occurring throughout many
###3643 areas of physics.
###3645 Physics is a broad subject.
###3647 We have the frontier of short distances, in which we study
###3650 the elementary particles and their interactions; the
###3653 frontier of long distances, the evolution of the whole
###3656 universe and the properties of the early universe.
###3660 But there's another frontier, also very exciting and very
###3662 active, which you could call the complexity frontier or
###3665 entanglement frontier, the study of highly entangled
###3669 systems with many parts.
###3671 That encompasses quantum computing, trying to
###3673 understand phases of quantum matter, and all the different
###3675 ways in which systems of many particles can be entangled.
###3679 That's an area in which we can expect great
###3681 progress in this century.
###3684 At Caltech, we have a center devoted to the exploration of
###3688 this entanglement frontier from many points of view.
###3691 And the IQIM has a slogan, which is nature is subtle,
###3697 where we are playing on Einstein's famous statement,
###3702 "Subtle is the Lord, but malicious He is not."
###3705 Einstein, for all his audacity and genius, underestimated the
###3709 subtlety of nature when he dismissed quantum entanglement
###3712 as spooky action at a distance.
###3715 And what we're trying to do in quantum information science
###3717 these days is to enjoy and relish and explore and exploit
###3722 ultimately the subtlety of the quantum world and all its
###3726 facets and ramifications.
###3727 Thanks for listening to me today.
###3729 
###3737 AUDIENCE: So I remember--
###3739 I noticed thinking when you were talking about how you
###3742 have to isolate the material, the quantum computer, from
###3746 outside observation that my immediate responses, and I
###3751 thought as an engineer, was like man, that's got to be
###3753 really tough to debug if something's going wrong.
###3757 So I was wondering so what are the implications there for how
###3760 you would program it?
###3761 Do you have to have like a mathematical proof that your
###3763 program is correct?
###3765 Because it doesn't seem like you could examine what it's
###3768 doing when it's executing.
###3769 
###3772 JOHN PRESKILL: So the question is if what I said is true,
###3774 that in order for a quantum computer to work it has to be
###3779 completely isolated from the outside world and we're not
###3781 able to look inside at what it's doing or in the course of
###3785 a computation, how would we ever debug it?
###3787 How would we as--
###3789 or you as engineers--
###3790 manage to figure out how to fix it when it's broken?
###3795 Well, the answer--
###3796 I mean I don't think there's any answer that's
###3798 surprising to you.
###3800 You would have to, in the process of developing a
###3804 quantum computer, benchmark different subroutines by
###3809 running them and seeing how well they performed.
###3811 You can break it all.
###3812 The big computation you can't simulate with a classical
###3815 computer because that's the whole reason you're building a
###3817 quantum computer.
###3819 The pieces of a computation, you can simulate.
###3821 You can compare such simulations to the operation
###3824 of the quantum hardware.
###3825 Then you can try to scale up to larger and
###3828 larger quantum circuits.
###3829 And in cases where you're doing computations for which
###3832 it is easy to know what the answer is, make sure you're
###3834 getting the right answer.
###3835 If it's not working, then look at the individual parts of
###3840 that circuit and try to improve their performance.
###3845 And there's no deep answer to that.
###3846 It's just sort of the obvious answer.
###3849 AUDIENCE: You mentioned earlier that quantum
###3853 techniques don't work equally well on all problems.
###3856 Some of them give exponential speedup, some of them only n
###3859 squared, that sort stuff.
###3861 I was wondering if you could give any further intuition on
###3864 what kinds of problems fall into the different?
###3866 JOHN PRESKILL: Yeah.
###3866 So I think the question is, I said that there are some
###3869 problems that quantum computers can achieve
###3874 spectacular speedups, many problems for which we think
###3878 that's not possible.
###3880 And so what's the intuition about whether a problem lies
###3884 in one class or the other or what's a nice
###3887 characterization?
###3888 Well, we don't have the complete answer to that.
###3891 I did say that we do not expect exponential speedups to
###3896 be possible for NP-hard problems.
###3901 We think that in such cases even a quantum computer
###3906 wouldn't in the worst case be able to do much better than a
###3910 brute force search.
###3911 And they can speed that up a little bit, but not a lot
###3914 compared to classical systems.
###3916 So first of all, we're talking about if we want to stay
###3919 within the class NP, where we can check the answer easily
###3924 with a classical computer, about a rather special class
###3927 of problems, which are outside P. So they're classically
###3930 hard, but not NP-hard.
###3932 Factoring is a candidate for being in the
###3935 intermediate class.
###3936 So other problems which are outside P, which we think
###3941 can't be solved in polynomial time with a classical
###3943 computer, but are not NP-hard, are candidates for quantum
###3946 algorithms.
###3947 But that's probably not exactly the right answer.
###3952 And I also tried to emphasize that we don't have to limit
###3954 ourselves to NP.
###3956 There are things that quantum computers could do that we
###3959 wouldn't be able to check classically.
###3960 We could check a quantum computer with another quantum
###3963 computer, things like simulation problems,
###3967 simulating quantum systems with many parts.
###3970 And I think the most potential that we currently know from
###3974 our current understanding of quantum computers for
###3977 nontrivial applications involve such simulation of
###3980 quantum systems.
###3983 AUDIENCE: Could you say something about the robustness
###3985 of entanglement?
###3986 So when you were talking about quantum computing, it seemed
###3989 like entanglement was this very delicate thing.
###3992 And you had to worry about the decoherence problems that when
###3995 two particles interact with the outside world, the
###3997 entanglement is lost.
###3999 But with this black hole problem, it seems like the
###4001 entanglement was indestructible.
###4002 And that was why these three propositions
###4004 couldn't all be true.
###4006 JOHN PRESKILL: Well, entanglement is
###4009 indestructible, even outside the context of the black hole
###4012 problem, in the sense that if you have systems that are
###4018 entangled with one another, although they may interact
###4021 with the environment, that doesn't really destroy the
###4024 entanglement.
###4025 It just means that the entanglement can now only be
###4028 detected if we look at entanglement between
###4031 subsystems that include the environment.
###4034 So the problem is that we don't control the
###4036 environment very well.
###4037 So if we look at just the system that we can control and
###4041 don't pay attention to the environment, then it can
###4043 appear that the entanglement is lost, even though it's
###4046 really there.
###4047 In the case of the black hole problem, I was really talking
###4050 about this issue of principle, of whether entanglement is
###4052 there or not, not whether it's there in a form that we can
###4055 control or even decode easily.
###4058 Which actually is an
###4058 interesting question of principle.
###4060 Is it a really hard problem to do the decoding that could
###4063 detect this entanglement?
###4065 And if it's a really hard problem, do maybe the laws of
###4068 physics tell us that this entanglement doesn't really
###4074 have an operational meaning?
###4077 AUDIENCE: So it sounds like it might be very difficult for
###4079 humans to build such a computer.
###4081 Do such computers exist in natural settings where some
###4087 spontaneous result appears quite naturally, like for
###4093 instance in superconductivity where some physical state is
###4098 just emergent from a large group of particles.
###4103 And the way they actually are doing it is a quantum
###4106 computer, but we don't know how it's happening?
###4109 
###4111 JOHN PRESKILL: Right.
###4112 So the question is for humans, it may be hard to realize
###4119 large-scale quantum computers.
###4121 Are there ways in which nature does it?
###4123 Are there natural processes in which quantum computation
###4126 occurs, so-to-speak spontaneously?
###4130 Yeah.
###4130 I mean it's sort of-- you know it was hard for us to build a
###4133 hydrogen bomb.
###4134 But the Sun does it.
###4135 In fact, it was hard to build a fission bomb, but there was
###4138 a spontaneous uranium reactor in Africa because too much
###4145 uranium was collected in one place.
###4147 So is quantum computation occurring by such naturally
###4152 occurring process somewhere?
###4154 I don't know.
###4156 My guess is that if we really want large-scale quantum
###4159 computers, which are hard to simulate classically--
###4164 well, I mean there are lots of things going on in physics
###4166 labs for which that might be a fair statement, that there are
###4173 states of quantum matter.
###4175 One famous one is the high-temperature
###4178 superconductors, which we don't understand very well
###4181 microscopically how they work because haven't so far been
###4184 able to simulate them on classical computers.
###4190 So maybe that system is, by simulating itself, is
###4194 performing a quantum computation in some sense.
###4197 Or more broadly, whenever a quantum system evolves forward
###4201 in time, it is in a sense behaving
###4204 like a quantum computer.
###4205 But I'm afraid that's probably too broad a notion of what we
###4208 mean by a quantum computer.
###4210 My guess is that nature has a way of
###4212 realizing quantum computers.
###4214 The way is to allow engineers to evolve, who build them.
###4221 And that's probably the way nature does it.
###4224 GREG KROAH-HARTMAN: Maybe we conclude it here and thank
###4226 John for a beautiful talk.
###4228 JOHN PRESKILL: All right.
###4229 Thanks for listening.
###4230
