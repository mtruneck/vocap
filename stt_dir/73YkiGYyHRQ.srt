1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:13,7



2
0:0:13,7 --> 0:0:17,48
JP WALKER: People are always
asking us, since the year


3
0:0:17,48 --> 0:0:19,44
after we stopped going it, why?


4
0:0:19,44 --> 0:0:20,0
What's up?


5
0:0:20,0 --> 0:0:21,6
When's it coming back?


6
0:0:21,6 --> 0:0:21,97
What's going on?


7
0:0:21,97 --> 0:0:26,9
And so then, of course, when the
word came out, people were


8
0:0:26,9 --> 0:0:28,36
freaking, you know?


9
0:0:28,36 --> 0:0:31,9
CHRIS GUNNARSON: So that first
year, it was a collaboration


10
0:0:31,9 --> 0:0:34,5
between me, Jeremy,
JP, and Downing.


11
0:0:34,5 --> 0:0:38,42
And so we thought, what
would be the cool


12
0:0:38,42 --> 0:0:41,15
contest/anti-contest that we
could do that would be unlike


13
0:0:41,15 --> 0:0:42,59
anything else that's
ever been done.


14
0:0:42,59 --> 0:0:46,66
It would be about progression,
but it'd be about vibe and


15
0:0:46,66 --> 0:0:49,86
cool energy.


16
0:0:49,86 --> 0:0:53,13
ANDY WRIGHT: I think the
first Jibfests were--


17
0:0:53,13 --> 0:0:56,45
it was pretty sick, because it
was just like we were 12 deep


18
0:0:56,45 --> 0:1:1,6
in a cabin in Big Bear eating
pizzas and drinking Budweiser.


19
0:1:1,6 --> 0:1:5,99
And it was like a lot of it was
just about hidden features


20
0:1:5,99 --> 0:1:8,29
that had never really been seen
before in parks because a


21
0:1:8,29 --> 0:1:10,43
lot of the park stuff was pretty
straightforward, just a


22
0:1:10,43 --> 0:1:12,88
down rail, a mailbox, a box,
something like that.


23
0:1:12,88 --> 0:1:17,55
And then they were starting to
think of the curved rails, and


24
0:1:17,55 --> 0:1:20,62
s-rails and different
kind of features.


25
0:1:20,62 --> 0:1:21,41
ZAK HALE: This is sick.


26
0:1:21,41 --> 0:1:24,305
You guys got the old
summit stuff?


27
0:1:24,305 --> 0:1:25,74
-Kind of.


28
0:1:25,74 --> 0:1:27,58
Kind of tried to replicate
a little bit of it.


29
0:1:27,58 --> 0:1:30,772
ZAK HALE: Double s-rail
This is tight.


30
0:1:30,772 --> 0:1:32,22
Let's go snowboard.


31
0:1:32,22 --> 0:2:12,18



32
0:2:12,18 --> 0:2:14,68
JP WALKER: The canvas was so
open for jibs, so everyone was


33
0:2:14,68 --> 0:2:16,48
like, we want this, we
want this and that.


34
0:2:16,48 --> 0:2:18,37
And now, it's kind of like so
many things have been done,


35
0:2:18,37 --> 0:2:21,75
it's like I really
would like this.


36
0:2:21,75 --> 0:2:24,29
There was only kind of one or
two things I was really


37
0:2:24,29 --> 0:2:28,27
looking for, versus 15
things as usual.


38
0:2:28,27 --> 0:2:31,8
I like the triple s-rail
and the circle.


39
0:2:31,8 --> 0:2:33,8
That's my two, just because
they remind


40
0:2:33,8 --> 0:2:34,39
me of the old Jibfest.


41
0:2:34,39 --> 0:2:36,92



42
0:2:36,92 --> 0:2:39,4
JEREMY JONES: Exactly for the
same two for the same reason.


43
0:2:39,4 --> 0:2:43,79
It just brings back the feeling
of the Jibfest for me.


44
0:2:43,79 --> 0:2:47,7
So it's just always a challenge
to do the s-rail,


45
0:2:47,7 --> 0:2:50,55
and the first person that
50-50s it is just--


46
0:2:50,55 --> 0:2:52,35
I mean, I've already
heard that cheer in


47
0:2:52,35 --> 0:2:53,6
my head, you know?


48
0:2:53,6 --> 0:2:57,79



49
0:2:57,79 --> 0:3:0,718
-That was insane, dude.


50
0:3:0,718 --> 0:3:2,67
How sick was that, dude?


51
0:3:2,67 --> 0:3:12,918



52
0:3:12,918 --> 0:3:14,42
-He one-upped you, dog.


53
0:3:14,42 --> 0:3:14,65
180--


54
0:3:14,65 --> 0:3:15,52
-Oh my god.


55
0:3:15,52 --> 0:3:29,7
-One-up


56
0:3:29,7 --> 0:3:31,55
DAVE DOWNING: Dude, Brian Thien
hasn't snowboarded in


57
0:3:31,55 --> 0:3:35,2
like three years, and he
just did the s-rail.


58
0:3:35,2 --> 0:3:36,25
-Dude, did he just
[INAUDIBLE] it?


59
0:3:36,25 --> 0:3:37,15
DAVE DOWNING: First day.


60
0:3:37,15 --> 0:3:38,12
In the first hour.


61
0:3:38,12 --> 0:3:40,11
-Yeah, Chico.


62
0:3:40,11 --> 0:3:41,39
BRIAN THIEN: I was pretty
stoked on that.


63
0:3:41,39 --> 0:3:42,8
CHRIS GRENIER: Is it true, you
didn't snowboard for four


64
0:3:42,8 --> 0:3:44,13
years before doing--


65
0:3:44,13 --> 0:3:46,38
BRIAN THIEN: Yeah, I haven't
snowboarded in forever, dude.


66
0:3:46,38 --> 0:3:48,24
The longer it's been since--


67
0:3:48,24 --> 0:3:49,692
CHRIS GRENIER: You didn't
snowboard for three years and


68
0:3:49,692 --> 0:3:50,86
you did the w-rail?


69
0:3:50,86 --> 0:3:53,16
BRIAN THIEN: Well, I
snowboarded twice.


70
0:3:53,16 --> 0:3:54,99
I went twice this year.


71
0:3:54,99 --> 0:3:55,61
CHRIS GRENIER: Damn.


72
0:3:55,61 --> 0:3:56,68
That's bad ass.


73
0:3:56,68 --> 0:3:58,94
JP WALKER: For Brian, he was one
of those guys that was in


74
0:3:58,94 --> 0:4:1,9
those old videos I used
to always look up to.


75
0:4:1,9 --> 0:4:6,81
But I feel like he
kind of fell back


76
0:4:6,81 --> 0:4:7,67
from filming or something.


77
0:4:7,67 --> 0:4:9,33
For some reason, he wasn't
really in any


78
0:4:9,33 --> 0:4:11,37
videos for a minute.


79
0:4:11,37 --> 0:4:15,13
It was cool to see him
get back into it.


80
0:4:15,13 --> 0:4:17,0
ANDY WRIGHT: What was so cool
about the jibbing thing, too,


81
0:4:17,0 --> 0:4:18,8
is it really showcased style.


82
0:4:18,8 --> 0:4:22,4
And guys like Thien and Downing
have insane style.


83
0:4:22,4 --> 0:4:24,8
They shifted their direction
of what they were doing.


84
0:4:24,8 --> 0:4:26,64
They could always jump and
do that other stuff.


85
0:4:26,64 --> 0:4:29,34
But now they can jib, so it just
kind of makes watching


86
0:4:29,34 --> 0:4:32,3
one of those guys' video part
more interesting, more


87
0:4:32,3 --> 0:4:34,56
well-rounded.


88
0:4:34,56 --> 0:4:36,956
BRIAN THIEN: I'm just here to
have a good time, and kind of


89
0:4:36,956 --> 0:4:40,39
stoke everyone out, and ride
with them and have fun.


90
0:4:40,39 --> 0:4:41,64
It's pretty awesome to watch.


91
0:4:41,64 --> 0:4:55,36



92
0:4:55,36 --> 0:4:57,49
DAVE DOWNING: I just
got broke off.


93
0:4:57,49 --> 0:4:58,87
43-year-old, Joe.


94
0:4:58,87 --> 0:5:0,14
I broke off.


95
0:5:0,14 --> 0:5:2,64
That's what I'm here for, is to
spark up these kids, dude.


96
0:5:2,64 --> 0:5:5,69



97
0:5:5,69 --> 0:5:6,44
-How hard can it be?


98
0:5:6,44 --> 0:5:9,45
JP WALKER: The very first big
box with the Lexan on it was


99
0:5:9,45 --> 0:5:11,55
something that me and
Jeremy wanted.


100
0:5:11,55 --> 0:5:14,69
And we'd just tell Gunny about
this thing, we used to always


101
0:5:14,69 --> 0:5:15,94
jib on this box.


102
0:5:15,94 --> 0:5:20,43



103
0:5:20,43 --> 0:5:24,37
So of course, they came up with
just a full replica of


104
0:5:24,37 --> 0:5:28,34
the box that we used to have
with the Lexan on top of it.


105
0:5:28,34 --> 0:5:30,93
Back then, I was just tripping
out, you know?


106
0:5:30,93 --> 0:5:33,8
Did a thousand nose-presses
on it.


107
0:5:33,8 --> 0:5:34,33
Just like, this thing's
insane.


108
0:5:34,33 --> 0:6:16,44



109
0:6:16,44 --> 0:6:18,35
CHRIS GRENIER: I just started
trying it, and it ended up


110
0:6:18,35 --> 0:6:21,26
taking a little longer than I
thought it was going to, but I


111
0:6:21,26 --> 0:6:22,46
was pretty psyched.


112
0:6:22,46 --> 0:6:25,39
I sprained my ankle three--


113
0:6:25,39 --> 0:6:26,57
about a month ago.


114
0:6:26,57 --> 0:6:29,92
Haven't been out, haven't been
able to do anything.


115
0:6:29,92 --> 0:6:31,56
I was like, I have to
go to the Jibfest.


116
0:6:31,56 --> 0:6:34,185
Got a shot of cortisone
in my ankle.


117
0:6:34,185 --> 0:6:36,65
I was like, I don't care, it's
probably messing it up, but.


118
0:6:36,65 --> 0:6:40,83
When I was 15, I was idolizing
all these guys.


119
0:6:40,83 --> 0:6:43,62
And just a little shithead kid
from Massachusetts, but now


120
0:6:43,62 --> 0:6:47,11
being here with all these
guys is crazy.


121
0:6:47,11 --> 0:6:49,313
If you were to tell me when I
was 15 that I was going to be


122
0:6:49,313 --> 0:6:53,2
in the Nixon Jibfest with JP
Walker, I'd be like, fuck you.


123
0:6:53,2 --> 0:6:55,5
I had posters of the guy on my
wall when I was a little kid.


124
0:6:55,5 --> 0:6:59,874



125
0:6:59,874 --> 0:7:1,818
DAVE DOWNING: Need me to
tie your boots for you?


126
0:7:1,818 --> 0:7:4,26
Get out there.


127
0:7:4,26 --> 0:7:7,39
CHRIS GUNNARSON: Nowadays, where
we focus on a lot of the


128
0:7:7,39 --> 0:7:8,11
big events--


129
0:7:8,11 --> 0:7:11,9
X Games, Dew Tours, and
US Opens and stuff.


130
0:7:11,9 --> 0:7:13,89
So the first thing I said was,
if we're going to bring the


131
0:7:13,89 --> 0:7:14,76
Jibfest back--


132
0:7:14,76 --> 0:7:18,53
the crew, and the lodging, and
the food, everything about


133
0:7:18,53 --> 0:7:22,77
it-- we wanted to be so on-point
that any person that


134
0:7:22,77 --> 0:7:25,62
was a part of this thing this
week would leave saying, that


135
0:7:25,62 --> 0:7:27,23
was a high point in my career.


136
0:7:27,23 --> 0:7:28,51
And that was one of
the coolest things


137
0:7:28,51 --> 0:7:29,76
I ever got to do.


138
0:7:29,76 --> 0:7:33,4



139
0:7:33,4 --> 0:7:36,24
And just sitting here today
watching the circle rail.


140
0:7:36,24 --> 0:7:40,57
If it even gets got, I'd say
mission accomplished.


141
0:7:40,57 --> 0:9:40,57
