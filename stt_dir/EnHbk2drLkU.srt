1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:16,99



2
0:0:16,99 --> 0:0:18,8
PAUL POLANSKY: No country
wants them.


3
0:0:18,8 --> 0:0:20,78
They're the people that
nobody wants.


4
0:0:20,78 --> 0:0:23,42
And of course, the Albanians
fought tooth and nail not to


5
0:0:23,42 --> 0:0:26,37
let them come back to their
original neighborhood.


6
0:0:26,37 --> 0:0:28,64
They didn't want Gypsies back
in their community.


7
0:0:28,64 --> 0:0:30,664
And this is the bottom
line in Kosovo.


8
0:0:30,664 --> 0:0:40,56



9
0:0:40,56 --> 0:0:43,74
THOMAS MORTON: We are on our way
to a refugee camp set up


10
0:0:43,74 --> 0:0:46,59
by the UN in 1999 for the
Gypsy community here.


11
0:0:46,59 --> 0:0:49,5
And we've heard terrible things
about the conditions of


12
0:0:49,5 --> 0:0:52,88
the camp and health of the
people who are there.


13
0:0:52,88 --> 0:0:54,225
S we're just going to
go and check it out.


14
0:0:54,225 --> 0:0:57,88



15
0:0:57,88 --> 0:1:0,155
In simplest terms, the conflict
in Kosovo is between


16
0:1:0,155 --> 0:1:2,2
the Serbian north and
the Albanian south.


17
0:1:2,2 --> 0:1:3,764
But it's not that simple.


18
0:1:3,764 --> 0:1:5,16
It's not simple at all.


19
0:1:5,16 --> 0:1:7,67
There's Serbian enclaves in the
south, Albanian pockets in


20
0:1:7,67 --> 0:1:10,12
the north, something called
Illyrians kind of in the


21
0:1:10,12 --> 0:1:12,45
middle, and like the rest of
Europe, Gypsies pretty much


22
0:1:12,45 --> 0:1:14,34
everywhere.


23
0:1:14,34 --> 0:1:17,34
The Gypsies, or Roma, are a
nomadic people who have been


24
0:1:17,34 --> 0:1:19,91
roaming around Europe since
the Roman times.


25
0:1:19,91 --> 0:1:21,83
They're in every major country
in Europe and are heavily


26
0:1:21,83 --> 0:1:24,3
discriminated against everywhere
they live.


27
0:1:24,3 --> 0:1:26,52
Western Europeans, even
supposedly tolerant Dutch


28
0:1:26,52 --> 0:1:29,42
types, accuse Gypsies of being
thieving, lying, welfare


29
0:1:29,42 --> 0:1:31,25
cheats, and generally a lot
less charming than their


30
0:1:31,25 --> 0:1:35,43
depiction in children's cartoons
or that Cher song.


31
0:1:35,43 --> 0:1:38,6
But while in most of Europe,
Gypsy mistreatment starts and


32
0:1:38,6 --> 0:1:41,14
ends with making fun of them and
not hiring them for jobs,


33
0:1:41,14 --> 0:1:44,14
in Kosovo, their treatment is
a million times harsher.


34
0:1:44,14 --> 0:1:47,2
To help solve the problem of
the Gypsy refugees, the UN


35
0:1:47,2 --> 0:1:50,32
invited Paul Polansky, an
American Gypsy expert, to come


36
0:1:50,32 --> 0:1:53,81
to Kosovo and help them
set up camps.


37
0:1:53,81 --> 0:1:57,22
PAUL POLANSKY: The EC
Commissioner for Human Rights


38
0:1:57,22 --> 0:2:2,4
issued a written report saying
that this was the worst human


39
0:2:2,4 --> 0:2:4,493
rights violation in Europe
in the past decade.


40
0:2:4,493 --> 0:2:8,979



41
0:2:8,979 --> 0:2:11,99
THOMAS MORTON: During the 1999
war in Kosovo, as Albanian and


42
0:2:11,99 --> 0:2:15,57
Serbian forces wailed on each
other, NATO began a bombing


43
0:2:15,57 --> 0:2:18,32
campaign in support of the
Albanians, displacing hundreds


44
0:2:18,32 --> 0:2:20,92
of thousands of people,
including most of


45
0:2:20,92 --> 0:2:22,28
the region's Gypsies.


46
0:2:22,28 --> 0:2:27,5
PAUL POLANSKY: Well, I came
to Kosovo in 1999--


47
0:2:27,5 --> 0:2:30,24
as almost every Western
journalist--


48
0:2:30,24 --> 0:2:31,68
pro-Albanian.


49
0:2:31,68 --> 0:2:35,15
We'd read in the "New York
Times" and heard in the media


50
0:2:35,15 --> 0:2:37,25
that the Albanians were
being ethnically


51
0:2:37,25 --> 0:2:38,83
cleansed by the Serbs.


52
0:2:38,83 --> 0:2:40,4
And that's true.


53
0:2:40,4 --> 0:2:42,49
But there was another
side of the coin.


54
0:2:42,49 --> 0:2:47,38
And I put it down to the abused
becoming the abuser.


55
0:2:47,38 --> 0:2:50,48
The Albanians had suffered
under the Serbs for many


56
0:2:50,48 --> 0:2:54,492
generations, and now they
have become the abusers.


57
0:2:54,492 --> 0:2:57,49
The UN opened a few
IDP camps--


58
0:2:57,49 --> 0:3:0,27
internally displaced people
camps-- and so they needed an


59
0:3:0,27 --> 0:3:2,6
expert to advise them.


60
0:3:2,6 --> 0:3:4,41
And that's what they brought
me to Kosovo to do.

63
0:3:9,94 --> 0:3:54,982



64
0:3:54,982 --> 0:3:56,49
THOMAS MORTON: It's obviously
depressing in here.


65
0:3:56,49 --> 0:4:0,44
And it's like an atrocity for
people in modern Europe or


66
0:4:0,44 --> 0:4:1,973
anywhere to live like this.


67
0:4:1,973 --> 0:4:4,71
But everybody's super
house-proud.


68
0:4:4,71 --> 0:4:6,255
They've taken care
of this place.


69
0:4:6,255 --> 0:4:8,43
It doesn't smell.


70
0:4:8,43 --> 0:4:9,185
It's clean--


71
0:4:9,185 --> 0:4:10,97
as much as it can be.


72
0:4:10,97 --> 0:4:11,66
Everybody's house is nice.


73
0:4:11,66 --> 0:4:13,33
Everybody's house is
decorated great.


74
0:4:13,33 --> 0:4:16,234



75
0:4:16,234 --> 0:4:18,809
Even the graffiti's
pretty well-done.

SKENDER GUSANI:

78
0:4:22,79 --> 0:4:43,37



79
0:4:43,37 --> 0:4:44,875
THOMAS MORTON: On top of
everything-- the cramped


80
0:4:44,875 --> 0:4:47,29
conditions, the hole in the
roof, never mind the fact that


81
0:4:47,29 --> 0:4:48,91
if any of the residents
step outside the


82
0:4:48,91 --> 0:4:50,52
camp, they risk a beatdown--


83
0:4:50,52 --> 0:4:52,17
every single child
inside the camp


84
0:4:52,17 --> 0:4:55,21
has severe lead poisoning.


85
0:4:55,21 --> 0:4:59,77
PAUL POLANSKY: There were about
1,800 tents built on the


86
0:4:59,77 --> 0:5:1,68
tailing stands of the mines.


87
0:5:1,68 --> 0:5:4,2
And the pollution from the
smelter drifted right over


88
0:5:4,2 --> 0:5:6,0
their camp.


89
0:5:6,0 --> 0:5:8,38
Their blood samples were sent
to a lab in Belgium.


90
0:5:8,38 --> 0:5:11,14
And Belgium said, please
retake the test.


91
0:5:11,14 --> 0:5:14,74
There's no such levels in
medical literature.


92
0:5:14,74 --> 0:5:17,44
And so the tests are retaken and
found that these children


93
0:5:17,44 --> 0:5:21,1
had the highest lead levels
in medical literature.


94
0:5:21,1 --> 0:5:24,415
And so, the UN medical team
said, Doctor Kouchner, you


95
0:5:24,415 --> 0:5:26,51
must evacuate these camps.


96
0:5:26,51 --> 0:5:27,43
Well, he didn't.


97
0:5:27,43 --> 0:5:30,84
And so that's where I broke my
relationship with the UN.


98
0:5:30,84 --> 0:5:34,13
We still have 40 families
in a toxic wasteland.


99
0:5:34,13 --> 0:5:40,15
And the other 100 were only
moved off in January and


100
0:5:40,15 --> 0:5:42,21
December of this past year.


101
0:5:42,21 --> 0:5:48,58
In 11 years, more than 100 Roma,
mainly children, died in


102
0:5:48,58 --> 0:5:51,541
these camps on this
toxic wasteland.

THOMAS MORTON: Gusani's camp is
actually the second one the


106
0:6:19,42 --> 0:6:21,26
UN set up in the area.


107
0:6:21,26 --> 0:6:24,17
The original camp, the one built
over an industrial waste


108
0:6:24,17 --> 0:6:25,85
site which caused all the
lead poisoning, is


109
0:6:25,85 --> 0:6:27,89
actually still open.


110
0:6:27,89 --> 0:6:29,99
Conditions there are obviously
worse than what we saw in


111
0:6:29,99 --> 0:6:32,64
Leposavic, and the effects of
the lead poisoning are even


112
0:6:32,64 --> 0:6:33,89
more drastic.

133
0:7:56,28 --> 0:8:0,53
this toxic wasteland has
a lead level between 15


134
0:8:0,53 --> 0:8:5,31

micrograms per deciliter.

Every kid is born with

And yet, they're telling us
there's no medical treatment.

148

PAUL POLANSKY: You have to
wonder why they put the Gypsy


149
0:9:15,48 --> 0:9:19,74
camp in a place that was
first, highly polluted,


150
0:9:19,74 --> 0:9:23,21
second, surrounded by
Albanian villages.


151
0:9:23,21 --> 0:9:25,3
Then they withdrew security.


152
0:9:25,3 --> 0:9:27,76
So you have to wonder, did they
want us wiped out so they


153
0:9:27,76 --> 0:9:33,49
wouldn't have to handle a Gypsy
problem in the future?


154
0:9:33,49 --> 0:9:35,28
THOMAS MORTON: As of making
this, it's been 12 years since


155
0:9:35,28 --> 0:9:36,45
the end of the war in Kosovo.


156
0:9:36,45 --> 0:9:39,54
Both temporary refugee camps
are still packed.


157
0:9:39,54 --> 0:9:41,7
And what talk there was about
helping families move back


158
0:9:41,7 --> 0:9:44,46
home has trickled
to a whisper.


159
0:9:44,46 --> 0:9:46,23
The whole deal underscores the
fact that, for all its


160
0:9:46,23 --> 0:9:48,79
rhetoric, the UN's not primarily
a humanitarian


161
0:9:48,79 --> 0:9:51,29
organization, but
a political one.


162
0:9:51,29 --> 0:9:52,88
All this raises the question
of whether they're


163
0:9:52,88 --> 0:9:55,77
intervention in these cases
actually does more good than


164
0:9:55,77 --> 0:9:57,48
it does harm.


165
0:9:57,48 --> 0:10:0,84
PAUL POLANSKY: We didn't have
AIDS in Kosovo until UN police


166
0:10:0,84 --> 0:10:1,71
brought it from Africa.


167
0:10:1,71 --> 0:10:2,54
THOMAS MORTON: Jesus.


168
0:10:2,54 --> 0:10:4,8
PAUL POLANSKY: We didn't have
brothels and houses of


169
0:10:4,8 --> 0:10:10,11
prostitution until UN police
made loans and investments in


170
0:10:10,11 --> 0:10:14,73
Kosovo to start the drug trade
and the prostitution trade.


171
0:10:14,73 --> 0:10:17,133
They're not answerable to
anybody, and that's how these


172
0:10:17,133 --> 0:10:18,32
kind of things can happen.


173
0:10:18,32 --> 0:10:20,45
They have diplomatic immunity.


174
0:10:20,45 --> 0:10:25,21
So this is our new crusade, is
to try and do draw awareness


175
0:10:25,21 --> 0:10:28,68
that they're refusing to
medically treat these kids.


176
0:10:28,68 --> 0:10:31,421



177
0:10:31,421 --> 0:10:34,54

kids, they would

0:10:34,54 --> 0:10:35,79
find a medical treatment.
