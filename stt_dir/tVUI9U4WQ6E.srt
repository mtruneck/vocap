2
0:0:3,514 --> 0:0:5,43
MALE SPEAKER: Thanks for
being here everybody.


3
0:0:5,43 --> 0:0:9,23
We're very lucky today to have
David Kilcullen as our guest.


4
0:0:9,23 --> 0:0:11,709
And by the way,
before I forget, I


5
0:0:11,709 --> 0:0:13,5
want to give a special
shout out to the men


6
0:0:13,5 --> 0:0:17,48
of the 23rd marine regiment
who are here as our guests.


7
0:0:17,48 --> 0:0:19,63
Thank you for your service.


8
0:0:19,63 --> 0:0:23,75
David Kilcullen is a
counter insurgency expert.


9
0:0:23,75 --> 0:0:26,62
He first, at least,
came to my attention


10
0:0:26,62 --> 0:0:29,63
as part of the surge
in Iraq in 2007,


11
0:0:29,63 --> 0:0:32,75
but his resume goes
much deeper than that.


12
0:0:32,75 --> 0:0:35,43
Today, he's going to talk
about what he's doing nowadays,


13
0:0:35,43 --> 0:0:41,3
which involves some work with
Google, actually, on Syria.


14
0:0:41,3 --> 0:0:44,65
He's been adviser to General
David Petraeus and Condoleezza


15
0:0:44,65 --> 0:0:49,44
Rice and is now operating a
consulting service in Virginia


16
0:0:49,44 --> 0:0:51,97
where he deals with all sorts
of interesting stuff, which


17
0:0:51,97 --> 0:0:53,909
he'll be happy to
tell you about.


18
0:0:53,909 --> 0:0:55,95
So please give a warm
welcome to David Kilcullen.


19
0:0:55,95 --> 0:0:58,815



20
0:0:58,815 --> 0:0:59,94
DAVID KILCULLEN: Thank you.


21
0:0:59,94 --> 0:1:2,34
It's actually great to be here
on such a beautiful day in San


22
0:1:2,34 --> 0:1:2,94
Francisco.


23
0:1:2,94 --> 0:1:4,356
I was talking to
a guy last night.


24
0:1:4,356 --> 0:1:7,142
He said the problem with San
Francisco is it makes you lazy.


25
0:1:7,142 --> 0:1:8,35
I was like, what do you mean?


26
0:1:8,35 --> 0:1:10,27
He was like well,
yesterday I woke up,


27
0:1:10,27 --> 0:1:12,11
and I had all this work
to do, but then I thought,


28
0:1:12,11 --> 0:1:14,318
I think I'm just going to
go for a hike with my wife.


29
0:1:14,318 --> 0:1:16,35
And I blew off the
whole-- and I'm like,


30
0:1:16,35 --> 0:1:17,48
I can totally see that.


31
0:1:17,48 --> 0:1:19,59
Every time I get off
the plane in California,


32
0:1:19,59 --> 0:1:22,39
I'm like, why don't
we live here again?


33
0:1:22,39 --> 0:1:25,58
So thank you for spending an
hour of a beautiful day inside


34
0:1:25,58 --> 0:1:29,5
with me when you could be out
doing a bunch of other stuff.


35
0:1:29,5 --> 0:1:31,38
Obviously, I just wrote this
book, which is why I'm here.


36
0:1:31,38 --> 0:1:34,49
But I thought what I
would do is just hit up


37
0:1:34,49 --> 0:1:36,19
some of the main
ideas in the book


38
0:1:36,19 --> 0:1:39,41
rather than try to give
you a full download,


39
0:1:39,41 --> 0:1:43,28
and then maybe in Q&A we can
kick those around, and discuss


40
0:1:43,28 --> 0:1:46,46
some of the main stuff
that comes out of it,


41
0:1:46,46 --> 0:1:50,99
and see what you guys are most
interested in talking about.


42
0:1:50,99 --> 0:1:54,51
I began writing the book
in September of 2009


43
0:1:54,51 --> 0:1:56,501
after getting ambushed
in Afghanistan.


44
0:1:56,501 --> 0:1:59,0
It's not the first, or in fact,
the last time that I've been


45
0:1:59,0 --> 0:2:1,18
ambushed in Afghanistan,
but this particular one


46
0:2:1,18 --> 0:2:2,26
was interesting.


47
0:2:2,26 --> 0:2:6,6
It was the classic late
afternoon ambush scenario


48
0:2:6,6 --> 0:2:8,479
that you get in Afghanistan,
because most of Eastern


49
0:2:8,479 --> 0:2:12,93
Afghanistan has a very, very
narrow set of valleys that


50
0:2:12,93 --> 0:2:15,74
have settlement patterns
of-- basically people live


51
0:2:15,74 --> 0:2:17,16
in the bottom of the valleys.


52
0:2:17,16 --> 0:2:19,35
Nobody lives on the
mountains themselves,


53
0:2:19,35 --> 0:2:22,127
and there's usually only
one road running down


54
0:2:22,127 --> 0:2:23,21
the middle of each valley.


55
0:2:23,21 --> 0:2:25,2
So if you go up that
valley in the morning,


56
0:2:25,2 --> 0:2:26,835
essentially everyone
in that whole community


57
0:2:26,835 --> 0:2:29,22
knows exactly where you're
going to be at 4 o'clock


58
0:2:29,22 --> 0:2:29,73
in the afternoon.


59
0:2:29,73 --> 0:2:31,72
You're going to be
driving down the valley.


60
0:2:31,72 --> 0:2:36,15
And in fact, Afghan
families have ambush spots


61
0:2:36,15 --> 0:2:39,23
like families in
the Chesapeake Bay


62
0:2:39,23 --> 0:2:41,25
have fishing spots
or families out here.


63
0:2:41,25 --> 0:2:44,44
They don't have to go through
the full complex planning


64
0:2:44,44 --> 0:2:46,63
process that an
infantry small unit does


65
0:2:46,63 --> 0:2:48,42
when it decides to do an ambush.


66
0:2:48,42 --> 0:2:49,75
They basically say hey, Abdul.


67
0:2:49,75 --> 0:2:50,81
Get to the ambush spot.


68
0:2:50,81 --> 0:2:53,268
Because they have three or four
of them already picked out.


69
0:2:53,268 --> 0:2:57,28
In fact, I was in another
ambush earlier in my career


70
0:2:57,28 --> 0:3:1,28
in Afghanistan where we actually
found old 303 ammunition


71
0:3:1,28 --> 0:3:2,87
from British rifles
that went out


72
0:3:2,87 --> 0:3:6,262
of service in the 19th century
up in these firing positions


73
0:3:6,262 --> 0:3:8,22
on either side of the
road, so they'd obviously


74
0:3:8,22 --> 0:3:12,771
been using this ambush site
for some considerable time.


75
0:3:12,771 --> 0:3:15,27
But I'm in the middle of this
ambush, and I think to myself,


76
0:3:15,27 --> 0:3:17,84
this is a pretty bad ambush.


77
0:3:17,84 --> 0:3:20,582
I've become a bit of an
involuntary connoisseur


78
0:3:20,582 --> 0:3:22,4
over the years,
and I actually used


79
0:3:22,4 --> 0:3:24,63
to teach ambushing
at the tactics school


80
0:3:24,63 --> 0:3:26,19
when I was captain.


81
0:3:26,19 --> 0:3:28,75
So I'm like, if these were my
students on the battle course,


82
0:3:28,75 --> 0:3:30,57
I would have failed them
for their ambush plan.


83
0:3:30,57 --> 0:3:32,1
It was just very
badly put together.


84
0:3:32,1 --> 0:3:35,22
It didn't come-- it
just didn't work.


85
0:3:35,22 --> 0:3:37,3
Anyway, we get to the
bottom of the valley,


86
0:3:37,3 --> 0:3:40,67
and I'm talking to my
driver of my Amrep, which


87
0:3:40,67 --> 0:3:42,805
is like a big
armored garbage truck


88
0:3:42,805 --> 0:3:45,91
that we drive around
in Afghanistan.


89
0:3:45,91 --> 0:3:48,1
And the driver says
to gunner, hey,


90
0:3:48,1 --> 0:3:50,287
how many Taliban guys
do you reckon we killed?


91
0:3:50,287 --> 0:3:52,62
And I was like, well, how do
you know they were Taliban?


92
0:3:52,62 --> 0:3:55,2
And they were like, dude,
they were shooting at us.


93
0:3:55,2 --> 0:3:56,27
And it took me a little while.


94
0:3:56,27 --> 0:3:59,11
I was actually on the
helicopter ride back afterwards.


95
0:3:59,11 --> 0:4:2,222
But I began to think maybe this
attack had actually nothing


96
0:4:2,222 --> 0:4:3,18
to do with the Taliban.


97
0:4:3,18 --> 0:4:5,13
And when I started to
think about what we've


98
0:4:5,13 --> 0:4:7,94
been doing in that valley for
the preceding two or three


99
0:4:7,94 --> 0:4:11,64
years, and the way that we
laid down a series of projects


100
0:4:11,64 --> 0:4:15,9
to help the community, and how
that had actually dis-empowered


101
0:4:15,9 --> 0:4:17,14
other people in the
community and created


102
0:4:17,14 --> 0:4:20,6
a big imbalance of resources
going into some villages


103
0:4:20,6 --> 0:4:23,21
and into others, I started to
realize that actually there's


104
0:4:23,21 --> 0:4:27,4
a lot more that meets the
eye in a place like Eastern


105
0:4:27,4 --> 0:4:30,3
Afghanistan around
stuff like contracting,


106
0:4:30,3 --> 0:4:34,8
and around denial of
access to services,


107
0:4:34,8 --> 0:4:38,55
and the way that people
interact with this giant tsunami


108
0:4:38,55 --> 0:4:42,15
of contracting and aid money
that comes into Afghanistan.


109
0:4:42,15 --> 0:4:46,8
About 14 times the size of the
total Afghan government budget


110
0:4:46,8 --> 0:4:49,69
is our aid programming
in Afghanistan.


111
0:4:49,69 --> 0:4:52,32
And I began to write
this book, trying


112
0:4:52,32 --> 0:4:56,852
to think beyond the paradigm
of counter insurgency,


113
0:4:56,852 --> 0:4:59,6
and for those people that
are in the military, that's


114
0:4:59,6 --> 0:5:0,11
like anathema.


115
0:5:0,11 --> 0:5:0,61
Like, what?


116
0:5:0,61 --> 0:5:1,58
Dave Kilcullen?


117
0:5:1,58 --> 0:5:3,94
Didn't you write a book
on counter insurgency?


118
0:5:3,94 --> 0:5:8,99
Yes, but it's just a book,
and we have this paradigm


119
0:5:8,99 --> 0:5:13,44
that we built, because it helped
us to win a conflict in Iraq,


120
0:5:13,44 --> 0:5:15,41
and it helped us
to win a variety


121
0:5:15,41 --> 0:5:17,987
of smaller fights
in other places.


122
0:5:17,987 --> 0:5:19,57
But that doesn't
mean that it's dogma,


123
0:5:19,57 --> 0:5:20,91
and that's the answer forever.


124
0:5:20,91 --> 0:5:24,91
Like any other human
model or mental picture


125
0:5:24,91 --> 0:5:28,99
of an environment, all it is is
a systematic oversimplification


126
0:5:28,99 --> 0:5:30,54
of very complex reality.


127
0:5:30,54 --> 0:5:32,23
And over time, when
you start to see


128
0:5:32,23 --> 0:5:35,7
data that don't fit
with your model,


129
0:5:35,7 --> 0:5:37,49
it's time to update the model.


130
0:5:37,49 --> 0:5:40,19
And so what I've been doing over
the past three or four years


131
0:5:40,19 --> 0:5:42,23
is thinking beyond
that and actually


132
0:5:42,23 --> 0:5:45,23
reaching back into some
work that I previously


133
0:5:45,23 --> 0:5:47,96
did when I was in the
Australian military looking


134
0:5:47,96 --> 0:5:50,489
at urbanized
environments, and I'm


135
0:5:50,489 --> 0:5:52,28
going to talk about
that a lot in a minute,


136
0:5:52,28 --> 0:5:54,87
but I just want to
set the context.


137
0:5:54,87 --> 0:5:58,34
Ever since 9/11, the military
in particular, but also


138
0:5:58,34 --> 0:6:0,8
aid agencies,
diplomatic services,


139
0:6:0,8 --> 0:6:3,11
a variety of other
organizations have


140
0:6:3,11 --> 0:6:5,54
gotten really good
at the kind of stuff


141
0:6:5,54 --> 0:6:8,24
that I was doing in
Eastern Afghanistan when


142
0:6:8,24 --> 0:6:10,43
I got shot up in 2009.


143
0:6:10,43 --> 0:6:14,1
Remote environments,
tribal communities,


144
0:6:14,1 --> 0:6:16,95
landlocked countries
like Afghanistan,


145
0:6:16,95 --> 0:6:21,32
the work that we do in little
remote frontier outposts


146
0:6:21,32 --> 0:6:25,27
has become, I think,
dramatically better quality


147
0:6:25,27 --> 0:6:27,27
than it was a decade ago.


148
0:6:27,27 --> 0:6:28,87
But if you look
at the environment


149
0:6:28,87 --> 0:6:31,52
that we've been operating
in, its very specific.


150
0:6:31,52 --> 0:6:33,86
Afghanistan's a very
diffuse conflict.


151
0:6:33,86 --> 0:6:36,22
The conflict mostly happens
in rural environments,


152
0:6:36,22 --> 0:6:37,64
not in the cities.


153
0:6:37,64 --> 0:6:41,95
It happens in this land
locked, mountainous arid, not


154
0:6:41,95 --> 0:6:44,56
very heavily
populated environment.


155
0:6:44,56 --> 0:6:47,97
And most importantly,
it's a very low bandwidth,


156
0:6:47,97 --> 0:6:49,6
low conductivity environment.


157
0:6:49,6 --> 0:6:51,71
Most people don't
have the ability


158
0:6:51,71 --> 0:6:55,914
to tap into an extensive
cellphone network, or access


159
0:6:55,914 --> 0:6:57,83
to the internet, or any
of the sorts of things


160
0:6:57,83 --> 0:7:2,926
that we take for granted
in the modern urban world.


161
0:7:2,926 --> 0:7:4,3
So as I was
researching the book,


162
0:7:4,3 --> 0:7:6,17
I started to think
to myself, what's


163
0:7:6,17 --> 0:7:8,3
going to happen
after Afghanistan?


164
0:7:8,3 --> 0:7:11,674
Now, it's become fashionable
in the politics world


165
0:7:11,674 --> 0:7:13,9
and the foreign
policy discussions


166
0:7:13,9 --> 0:7:15,75
in Washington to act like
the war in Afghanistan


167
0:7:15,75 --> 0:7:18,38
is already over, like
we don't currently


168
0:7:18,38 --> 0:7:20,685
have all these troops out
there fighting and dying


169
0:7:20,685 --> 0:7:23,6
on the ground, or diplomats
doing the work they're doing,


170
0:7:23,6 --> 0:7:25,71
or aid agencies or
other people doing


171
0:7:25,71 --> 0:7:28,7
the hard work in Afghanistan,
like that's all finished.


172
0:7:28,7 --> 0:7:31,519
Actually, our friends
are still out there doing


173
0:7:31,519 --> 0:7:33,6
this stuff on the
ground, and I think


174
0:7:33,6 --> 0:7:35,802
it's really important
to not forget that.


175
0:7:35,802 --> 0:7:37,77
That said, it's pretty
clear that the conflict


176
0:7:37,77 --> 0:7:41,4
is going to start winding
down in the next year or two,


177
0:7:41,4 --> 0:7:43,28
and it's worth
asking yourself what


178
0:7:43,28 --> 0:7:44,99
does the future
environment look like?


179
0:7:44,99 --> 0:7:46,98
Does it look like
Afghanistan, or does it


180
0:7:46,98 --> 0:7:48,46
look like something else?


181
0:7:48,46 --> 0:7:54,11
And a lot of the book is my
exploration of that question.


182
0:7:54,11 --> 0:7:57,66
When I look at the future
environment, what I see


183
0:7:57,66 --> 0:7:59,54
is a very high
degree of what you


184
0:7:59,54 --> 0:8:2,7
might call operational
continuity.


185
0:8:2,7 --> 0:8:4,78
The stuff that we
do, we will keep


186
0:8:4,78 --> 0:8:7,17
on doing mostly
that kind of stuff


187
0:8:7,17 --> 0:8:8,87
in the future environment.


188
0:8:8,87 --> 0:8:12,329
As an example of that, if you
go back in US military history


189
0:8:12,329 --> 0:8:14,62
to about the middle of the
19th century around the time


190
0:8:14,62 --> 0:8:17,16
of the Mexican War, and
you start a timeline then,


191
0:8:17,16 --> 0:8:19,17
and you run it
forward to now, you


192
0:8:19,17 --> 0:8:23,2
find a really, really consistent
pattern in US military history


193
0:8:23,2 --> 0:8:28,29
where we do a large scale or
long duration irregular warfare


194
0:8:28,29 --> 0:8:31,89
campaign about once
every 20 to 25 years,


195
0:8:31,89 --> 0:8:35,654
and we do small ones on a
scale of Kosovo, or East Timor,


196
0:8:35,654 --> 0:8:39,78
or Sierra Leone about once
every 5 to 10 years in between.


197
0:8:39,78 --> 0:8:42,48
And that patent is not
only very consistent


198
0:8:42,48 --> 0:8:45,49
and appears to be totally
unaffected by policymakers'


199
0:8:45,49 --> 0:8:46,64
preferences.


200
0:8:46,64 --> 0:8:49,9
So beginning of last
year, President Obama


201
0:8:49,9 --> 0:8:51,42
gave direction to
the US military


202
0:8:51,42 --> 0:8:52,92
where he said we're
going to get out


203
0:8:52,92 --> 0:8:55,77
of the business of doing
large scale, long duration


204
0:8:55,77 --> 0:8:58,69
stabilization operations
or counter insurgencies.


205
0:8:58,69 --> 0:9:0,36
He said we're not going to
structure the force for that


206
0:9:0,36 --> 0:9:1,78
anymore.


207
0:9:1,78 --> 0:9:4,16
Turns out President Clinton
said basically the same thing


208
0:9:4,16 --> 0:9:6,24
in 1992.


209
0:9:6,24 --> 0:9:9,92
Candidate George W. Bush
said the same thing in 2000.


210
0:9:9,92 --> 0:9:12,3
President Johnson said
the same thing in 1964.


211
0:9:12,3 --> 0:9:13,92
You can run this
back, and you'll


212
0:9:13,92 --> 0:9:17,874
find about seven presidents in
the 20th century alone making


213
0:9:17,874 --> 0:9:19,29
basically the same
comment, and it


214
0:9:19,29 --> 0:9:21,97
has zero effect on
how often we get


215
0:9:21,97 --> 0:9:24,0
into these kinds of conflicts.


216
0:9:24,0 --> 0:9:27,41
Across the planet since the
end of the Napoleonic Wars,


217
0:9:27,41 --> 0:9:32,2
roughly 80% of all conflict
has been intrastate--


218
0:9:32,2 --> 0:9:35,7
that is within communities,
within one country-- or it's


219
0:9:35,7 --> 0:9:39,94
involved a non-state armed group
like pirates, or insurgents,


220
0:9:39,94 --> 0:9:45,35
or some other kind of combatant
that is not a nation state.


221
0:9:45,35 --> 0:9:49,39
So that is in fact-- that's
the typical environment that we


222
0:9:49,39 --> 0:9:52,41
operate or the stereotypical
type of work that we do.


223
0:9:52,41 --> 0:9:55,906
But the environment that
we've operated in the past


224
0:9:55,906 --> 0:9:58,3
is not the environment that
we're going to look at.


225
0:9:58,3 --> 0:10:2,75
So operational continuity
but a strong environmental


226
0:10:2,75 --> 0:10:5,18
discontinuity
between what's coming


227
0:10:5,18 --> 0:10:7,41
and what we've been
doing in the last decade,


228
0:10:7,41 --> 0:10:11,8
this landlocked remote
rural environment.


229
0:10:11,8 --> 0:10:14,55
Now, American forces,
particularly the army


230
0:10:14,55 --> 0:10:17,42
and the Marine Corps were
very heavily involved


231
0:10:17,42 --> 0:10:19,37
in urban fighting in Iraq.


232
0:10:19,37 --> 0:10:21,8
So talking to an
American audience,


233
0:10:21,8 --> 0:10:23,98
it's easy to think that actually
we have a lot of experience


234
0:10:23,98 --> 0:10:26,15
globally in urban operations.


235
0:10:26,15 --> 0:10:27,92
That's actually not true.


236
0:10:27,92 --> 0:10:31,35
There were 50 countries in
Iraq, 51 in Afghanistan,


237
0:10:31,35 --> 0:10:33,48
but only one of those
that it was involved


238
0:10:33,48 --> 0:10:35,6
in any significant
urban fighting


239
0:10:35,6 --> 0:10:37,47
was the American
military in Baghdad.


240
0:10:37,47 --> 0:10:39,83
When I deployed to
Baghdad in-- I'm


241
0:10:39,83 --> 0:10:42,1
sorry-- and Ramadi and
all the other areas


242
0:10:42,1 --> 0:10:43,88
around that in the
American sector.


243
0:10:43,88 --> 0:10:47,88
When I deployed to Baghdad in
February of 2007, at that time,


244
0:10:47,88 --> 0:10:52,1
more than 50% of total combat
action in the war in Iraq


245
0:10:52,1 --> 0:10:54,85
was happening inside
Baghdad city limits,


246
0:10:54,85 --> 0:10:56,84
which is a purely US theater.


247
0:10:56,84 --> 0:10:59,57
Everybody else engaged
in the conflict


248
0:10:59,57 --> 0:11:1,55
was out in more remote
rural environments,


249
0:11:1,55 --> 0:11:4,8
where frankly there was a
lot less violence going on.


250
0:11:4,8 --> 0:11:7,21
So for most of the 50
countries that we're in Iraq,


251
0:11:7,21 --> 0:11:9,37
normal is not urban.


252
0:11:9,37 --> 0:11:13,84
Normal is farms, little
villages, rural districts,


253
0:11:13,84 --> 0:11:17,97
not a lot of fighting, more like
peacekeeping and stabilization.


254
0:11:17,97 --> 0:11:20,4
And for everybody that
went to Afghanistan,


255
0:11:20,4 --> 0:11:23,8
you're dealing with this
rural diffuse environment.


256
0:11:23,8 --> 0:11:27,53
But looking forward,
I see four big trends


257
0:11:27,53 --> 0:11:30,23
that are actually
changing the environment


258
0:11:30,23 --> 0:11:34,8
and will shape how we operate or
where we operate in the future,


259
0:11:34,8 --> 0:11:38,54
and those trends are population,
urbanization, littoralization--


260
0:11:38,54 --> 0:11:41,85
which is just the tendency
for things to cluster


261
0:11:41,85 --> 0:11:47,14
on coastlines-- and then
most importantly electronic


262
0:11:47,14 --> 0:11:48,8
network connectivity.


263
0:11:48,8 --> 0:11:51,48
Now, those first
three trends are old.


264
0:11:51,48 --> 0:11:54,9
They've been around for at least
200 years since the beginning


265
0:11:54,9 --> 0:11:56,42
of the European
Industrial Revolution.


266
0:11:56,42 --> 0:11:58,52
They're also very
well understood


267
0:11:58,52 --> 0:11:59,771
in the military in particular.


268
0:11:59,771 --> 0:12:1,603
Let me just talk about
them briefly before I


269
0:12:1,603 --> 0:12:3,61
go to what I think is
the more important one,


270
0:12:3,61 --> 0:12:4,96
which is connectivity.


271
0:12:4,96 --> 0:12:9,26
So, population growth, at the
beginning of the US Industrial


272
0:12:9,26 --> 0:12:11,618
Revolution in 17-- sorry,
the European Industrial


273
0:12:11,618 --> 0:12:15,67
Revolution in 1750, the total
population of the planet


274
0:12:15,67 --> 0:12:18,46
was about 750 million people.


275
0:12:18,46 --> 0:12:20,6
It took 150 years
for that population


276
0:12:20,6 --> 0:12:22,63
to double through
the first century


277
0:12:22,63 --> 0:12:26,11
and a half of industrialization
and the invention of things


278
0:12:26,11 --> 0:12:29,99
like new ways to think
about irrigation, new ways


279
0:12:29,99 --> 0:12:32,73
to think about crops,
concentration of population


280
0:12:32,73 --> 0:12:35,22
in urban environments,
improvements in public health.


281
0:12:35,22 --> 0:12:39,45
All those sorts of things led to
this population growth process


282
0:12:39,45 --> 0:12:42,39
that began in the middle
of the 18th century.


283
0:12:42,39 --> 0:12:44,83
By 1900, we were at
1.5 billion people,


284
0:12:44,83 --> 0:12:49,91
so we doubled the population of
the planet in about 150 years.


285
0:12:49,91 --> 0:12:57,48
We then doubled that population
again in only 60 years by 1960,


286
0:12:57,48 --> 0:13:0,92
so we get to 3 billion
people on the planet in 1960.


287
0:13:0,92 --> 0:13:3,59
And it's worth noting that
that second doubling happened


288
0:13:3,59 --> 0:13:6,78
during the same time
frame as both world wars


289
0:13:6,78 --> 0:13:11,27
and a major influenza pandemic
across the entire planet, which


290
0:13:11,27 --> 0:13:14,88
between them killed
about 150 million, mainly


291
0:13:14,88 --> 0:13:16,17
young and healthy people.


292
0:13:16,17 --> 0:13:20,58
So despite that, we saw this
doubling by 1960 to 3 billion.


293
0:13:20,58 --> 0:13:23,39
The population then doubled
again by the year 2000


294
0:13:23,39 --> 0:13:26,17
to 6 billion, and in just
the dozen years since then,


295
0:13:26,17 --> 0:13:28,29
we've added slightly more
than a billion people.


296
0:13:28,29 --> 0:13:31,2
So today, were looking at
around about 7 billion people


297
0:13:31,2 --> 0:13:32,13
on the planet.


298
0:13:32,13 --> 0:13:36,0
Projecting that forward is not
a matter of simple prediction,


299
0:13:36,0 --> 0:13:38,4
it's a matter of looking at
the demographic bell curve,


300
0:13:38,4 --> 0:13:42,84
and where people are right now,
and where the population growth


301
0:13:42,84 --> 0:13:44,14
is likely to take us.


302
0:13:44,14 --> 0:13:47,314
But the Bureau of Economic
and Social Affairs at the UN


303
0:13:47,314 --> 0:13:48,73
and a bunch of
other organizations


304
0:13:48,73 --> 0:13:51,742
that look at the stuff
project that by the middle


305
0:13:51,742 --> 0:13:53,45
of the century we're
looking at something


306
0:13:53,45 --> 0:13:56,92
like 9.5 billion
people on the planet,


307
0:13:56,92 --> 0:14:1,659
so about another 2.5 billion
people between now and 2050.


308
0:14:1,659 --> 0:14:3,45
There is a projection
that the population's


309
0:14:3,45 --> 0:14:5,71
going to top out at
around that level


310
0:14:5,71 --> 0:14:9,7
and stay at essentially
9.5 billion by 2050.


311
0:14:9,7 --> 0:14:11,4
That's based on
certain assumptions


312
0:14:11,4 --> 0:14:15,14
about what happens to birth
rate when GDP increases,


313
0:14:15,14 --> 0:14:16,82
and they may not
actually play out.


314
0:14:16,82 --> 0:14:19,68
So we're looking at least
2 1/2 billion more people


315
0:14:19,68 --> 0:14:23,87
on the planet in our generation.


316
0:14:23,87 --> 0:14:25,92
The second factor,
though, is urbanization.


317
0:14:25,92 --> 0:14:27,92
So if you go back again to the
beginning of the Industrial


318
0:14:27,92 --> 0:14:29,94
Revolution and you think
about the population


319
0:14:29,94 --> 0:14:32,52
of the planet at
that time, roughly 2%


320
0:14:32,52 --> 0:14:35,37
of people on the
earth in 1800 lived


321
0:14:35,37 --> 0:14:37,49
in a city of a million or more.


322
0:14:37,49 --> 0:14:40,15
By 1900, it was 10%.


323
0:14:40,15 --> 0:14:42,61
By 1960, it was 25%.


324
0:14:42,61 --> 0:14:45,45
By April of 2008, it was 50%.


325
0:14:45,45 --> 0:14:47,14
We're currently
sitting somewhere north


326
0:14:47,14 --> 0:14:49,64
of 50% urbanization
on the planet,


327
0:14:49,64 --> 0:14:52,35
so roughly half the
people on the planet


328
0:14:52,35 --> 0:14:55,44
live in a city of
a million or more.


329
0:14:55,44 --> 0:14:59,69
Again, the same projections
suggest that by 2050 we'll


330
0:14:59,69 --> 0:15:3,99
be looking at somewhere between
65% and 75% urbanization.


331
0:15:3,99 --> 0:15:7,39
So somewhere around the current
population of the planet--


332
0:15:7,39 --> 0:15:11,19
7 billion people-- will
be living in a large city


333
0:15:11,19 --> 0:15:13,58
by the middle of the century.


334
0:15:13,58 --> 0:15:16,49
Interestingly, that
urbanization process


335
0:15:16,49 --> 0:15:20,26
is not only going to account
for all the gross population


336
0:15:20,26 --> 0:15:21,244
growth on the planet.


337
0:15:21,244 --> 0:15:23,16
It's also going to account
for a lot of people


338
0:15:23,16 --> 0:15:25,41
leaving rural
environments and moving


339
0:15:25,41 --> 0:15:28,22
to the cities between now and
the middle of the century.


340
0:15:28,22 --> 0:15:30,12
So actually the
urban environment


341
0:15:30,12 --> 0:15:33,6
is going to grow by roughly
3 billion people between now


342
0:15:33,6 --> 0:15:35,11
and the middle of the century.


343
0:15:35,11 --> 0:15:38,8
Roughly 1 1/2 million people
per week migrate from a country


344
0:15:38,8 --> 0:15:43,94
area to a city, so roughly the
same number of people that it


345
0:15:43,94 --> 0:15:47,61
took all of human history
until 1960 to generate across


346
0:15:47,61 --> 0:15:51,7
the entire planet are going to
move to cities within the next


347
0:15:51,7 --> 0:15:52,78
30 years.


348
0:15:52,78 --> 0:15:54,87
Edgar Peters, who's the
head of the Africa City


349
0:15:54,87 --> 0:15:56,9
Center in Cape Town
in South Africa,


350
0:15:56,9 --> 0:16:0,69
says we're looking at dramatic
disruptive change in just one


351
0:16:0,69 --> 0:16:3,95
generation because of that
urbanization and population


352
0:16:3,95 --> 0:16:6,52
growth.


353
0:16:6,52 --> 0:16:8,362
That's not all, though.


354
0:16:8,362 --> 0:16:10,1
Those urban
environments will not


355
0:16:10,1 --> 0:16:12,4
be evenly distributed across
the surface of the earth.


356
0:16:12,4 --> 0:16:15,5
They'll be almost entirely
in the developing world


357
0:16:15,5 --> 0:16:17,71
in low and middle
income countries.


358
0:16:17,71 --> 0:16:19,73
This is not a
phenomenon that we see


359
0:16:19,73 --> 0:16:21,29
in Europe and the United States.


360
0:16:21,29 --> 0:16:24,91
It's a phenomenon of sub-Saharan
Africa, that Mediterranean


361
0:16:24,91 --> 0:16:27,65
basin, South Asia, Latin
America, and the Caribbean.


362
0:16:27,65 --> 0:16:29,9
It's not evenly distributed.


363
0:16:29,9 --> 0:16:32,68
It's developing world cities.


364
0:16:32,68 --> 0:16:35,38
And those cities
are overwhelmingly


365
0:16:35,38 --> 0:16:39,35
located on coastlines for
reasons of basic physics.


366
0:16:39,35 --> 0:16:43,4
When you want to move
heavy large stuff around,


367
0:16:43,4 --> 0:16:45,57
for all of you in
history and still now,


368
0:16:45,57 --> 0:16:48,46
it's been a hell of a lot easier
to move that around by water


369
0:16:48,46 --> 0:16:49,54
than on land.


370
0:16:49,54 --> 0:16:53,21
So cities have tended to cluster
against large bodies of water


371
0:16:53,21 --> 0:16:56,29
on rivers, on major
river deltas, lakes,


372
0:16:56,29 --> 0:16:57,57
or on coastlines.


373
0:16:57,57 --> 0:17:0,28
Already today, 80% of
people on the planet


374
0:17:0,28 --> 0:17:2,312
live within 50 miles of the sea.


375
0:17:2,312 --> 0:17:5,369
And of course, we're dealing
with what systems theorists


376
0:17:5,369 --> 0:17:7,71
would call sensitivity to
initial conditions here.


377
0:17:7,71 --> 0:17:10,16
So as urbanization
takes place, it's


378
0:17:10,16 --> 0:17:11,66
not happening against
the background


379
0:17:11,66 --> 0:17:15,49
of an evenly distributed
human population.


380
0:17:15,49 --> 0:17:17,38
Cities are already
on coastlines,


381
0:17:17,38 --> 0:17:19,46
so as people move
to existing cities,


382
0:17:19,46 --> 0:17:21,73
they're going to be
moving to coastlines.


383
0:17:21,73 --> 0:17:24,48
So we're going to see
a population that's


384
0:17:24,48 --> 0:17:28,45
incredibly clustered in urban
environments in third world


385
0:17:28,45 --> 0:17:29,76
cities on coastlines.


386
0:17:29,76 --> 0:17:32,485



387
0:17:32,485 --> 0:17:34,11
Obviously, that
changes the environment


388
0:17:34,11 --> 0:17:36,282
in which we operate, but
actually the military well


389
0:17:36,282 --> 0:17:37,74
understood this
stuff 25 years ago.


390
0:17:37,74 --> 0:17:39,99
So a marine general
called Krulak


391
0:17:39,99 --> 0:17:43,17
wrote about a thing called a
three block war in the 1990s,


392
0:17:43,17 --> 0:17:45,955
and he had guys like Ralph
Peters and Robert Scales--


393
0:17:45,955 --> 0:17:47,455
and these are all
military theorists


394
0:17:47,455 --> 0:17:50,99
that I'm mentioning-- who really
focused on the problems of what


395
0:17:50,99 --> 0:17:54,9
we call the urban littoral
back in the 1990s.


396
0:17:54,9 --> 0:17:55,34
And I read some stuff on this.


397
0:17:55,34 --> 0:17:58,882
It was pretty well understood
in the community at that point.


398
0:17:58,882 --> 0:18:0,34
But what's happened
is the military


399
0:18:0,34 --> 0:18:4,19
since 9/11 has been dragged off
into this other environment.


400
0:18:4,19 --> 0:18:7,36
Now, I wouldn't call Afghanistan
a geographical fluke.


401
0:18:7,36 --> 0:18:10,96
There are deserts, and
mountains, and jungles


402
0:18:10,96 --> 0:18:13,65
where conflict is going
to occur in the future,


403
0:18:13,65 --> 0:18:15,49
but because conflict
tends to happen where


404
0:18:15,49 --> 0:18:18,9
people live and the
general parameters


405
0:18:18,9 --> 0:18:20,76
of human civilization shape
the parameters within which


406
0:18:20,76 --> 0:18:24,4
conflict happens, the majority
of conflict on the planet,


407
0:18:24,4 --> 0:18:26,59
like the majority of
everything on the planet,


408
0:18:26,59 --> 0:18:28,57
is going to happen
in third world


409
0:18:28,57 --> 0:18:31,379
coastal cities by the
middle of the century.


410
0:18:31,379 --> 0:18:33,45
And I can talk more
in detail in the Q&A


411
0:18:33,45 --> 0:18:36,101
if you like about the
data that supports that.


412
0:18:36,101 --> 0:18:38,6
But what's really interesting
to me is not these old trends.


413
0:18:38,6 --> 0:18:39,76
They've been around
for a long time,


414
0:18:39,76 --> 0:18:40,926
and they're well understood.


415
0:18:40,926 --> 0:18:43,93
What's interesting is the new
trend, which is connectivity.


416
0:18:43,93 --> 0:18:45,93
Now, I'm talking to a
bunch of people at Google,


417
0:18:45,93 --> 0:18:48,5
so I probably don't need to
go into the level of detail


418
0:18:48,5 --> 0:18:50,59
on this that I have with
some of the other folks


419
0:18:50,59 --> 0:18:53,66
that I've spoken to, but
just a couple of data points.


420
0:18:53,66 --> 0:18:58,4
In the year 2000, there were
30,000 cellphones in Nigeria.


421
0:18:58,4 --> 0:19:1,97
Today, there are 113 million.


422
0:19:1,97 --> 0:19:4,86
Last year, I spent some time
walking around Mogadishu


423
0:19:4,86 --> 0:19:6,3
engaging with the
community there


424
0:19:6,3 --> 0:19:9,97
on some work we were
doing, and Mogadishu


425
0:19:9,97 --> 0:19:13,1
is a city that
survived for 20 years


426
0:19:13,1 --> 0:19:15,42
without a government
or a central state.


427
0:19:15,42 --> 0:19:18,23
24% of people that
live in Mogadishu


428
0:19:18,23 --> 0:19:19,53
own and use a cell phone.


429
0:19:19,53 --> 0:19:21,65
There are four major
cellphone companies.


430
0:19:21,65 --> 0:19:24,83
Internet access from Mogadishu
is actually a lot easier


431
0:19:24,83 --> 0:19:26,7
than from parts of
the United States


432
0:19:26,7 --> 0:19:29,4
if you want to talk to people,
because you're very closely


433
0:19:29,4 --> 0:19:33,1
geographically connected to the
international undersea cable


434
0:19:33,1 --> 0:19:34,45
network.


435
0:19:34,45 --> 0:19:38,762
There's a market in the middle
of Mogadishu called the Bakaara


436
0:19:38,762 --> 0:19:40,72
Market, which was the
scene of a big gun battle


437
0:19:40,72 --> 0:19:43,7
about 20 years ago.


438
0:19:43,7 --> 0:19:44,82
On the ground floor
of that market


439
0:19:44,82 --> 0:19:47,43
is a currency trading
exchange where


440
0:19:47,43 --> 0:19:49,99
people are on the internet
and on their cell phones,


441
0:19:49,99 --> 0:19:52,18
and they're trading the
Somali Shilling, which


442
0:19:52,18 --> 0:19:54,18
is the currency again
that survived for 20 years


443
0:19:54,18 --> 0:19:55,35
without a central bank.


444
0:19:55,35 --> 0:19:57,65
It floats on international
exchange rates.


445
0:19:57,65 --> 0:19:59,79
It gets updated
five times a day,


446
0:19:59,79 --> 0:20:4,19
and the traders on that floor
punch out a SMS text message


447
0:20:4,19 --> 0:20:7,17
to everybody that trades
in the city five times


448
0:20:7,17 --> 0:20:8,81
a day with the
current exchange rate.


449
0:20:8,81 --> 0:20:9,93
And so you have
all these traders


450
0:20:9,93 --> 0:20:11,679
out there on their
cellphones all the time


451
0:20:11,679 --> 0:20:14,644
tapping into a global
patent of commerce.


452
0:20:14,644 --> 0:20:16,6
And one of the
things we're seeing


453
0:20:16,6 --> 0:20:19,4
is that access to the
international networks


454
0:20:19,4 --> 0:20:21,62
of trade, things like
remittance flows,


455
0:20:21,62 --> 0:20:23,63
arbitrage, the
movement of currency


456
0:20:23,63 --> 0:20:25,62
or the movement of
goods around the planet


457
0:20:25,62 --> 0:20:29,1
has overtaken
agricultural surplus


458
0:20:29,1 --> 0:20:31,5
as a major driver
of city growth.


459
0:20:31,5 --> 0:20:34,54
So Mogadishu is
not a city that can


460
0:20:34,54 --> 0:20:37,51
be sustained by the rest
of the Somali economy.


461
0:20:37,51 --> 0:20:39,94
The reason that it's there
and it's that big is it's


462
0:20:39,94 --> 0:20:41,12
a trading city.


463
0:20:41,12 --> 0:20:43,23
It's always been
there, but now it's


464
0:20:43,23 --> 0:20:46,765
not just a trading city that
sends charcoal to Yemen,


465
0:20:46,765 --> 0:20:49,49
or sends cart around
the rest of the country,


466
0:20:49,49 --> 0:20:52,1
and engages in basic
commodities trading.


467
0:20:52,1 --> 0:20:54,34
It's also a trading city
that's international,


468
0:20:54,34 --> 0:20:59,0
because you have 800,000 Somalis
in the international diaspora,


469
0:20:59,0 --> 0:21:2,62
and they're connected to the 7
1/2 million Somalis that live


470
0:21:2,62 --> 0:21:6,52
in the country in a way that
just never was possible before.


471
0:21:6,52 --> 0:21:10,62
Another example, we
mentioned Syria earlier.


472
0:21:10,62 --> 0:21:15,0
Until 2000, there was virtually
no internet, no satellite,


473
0:21:15,0 --> 0:21:18,67
television, and no cell
phone access in Syria.


474
0:21:18,67 --> 0:21:22,2
Hafez al-Assad, the president
of Syria from the 1970s,


475
0:21:22,2 --> 0:21:23,12
came from peasant stock.


476
0:21:23,12 --> 0:21:24,203
He was a bit of a Luddite.


477
0:21:24,203 --> 0:21:26,85
He wasn't that interested in
allowing Syrians to connect


478
0:21:26,85 --> 0:21:30,37
to the rest of the world for
a variety of obvious reasons,


479
0:21:30,37 --> 0:21:34,62
and he essentially denied
access to all this connectivity


480
0:21:34,62 --> 0:21:37,38
until his death in 2000.


481
0:21:37,38 --> 0:21:39,58
His son, though,
Bashar al-Assad,


482
0:21:39,58 --> 0:21:41,57
was a bit more of
a computer nerd.


483
0:21:41,57 --> 0:21:44,81
He was the president of
the Syrian Computer Society


484
0:21:44,81 --> 0:21:46,37
before becoming president.


485
0:21:46,37 --> 0:21:49,52
He was a bit of a AV
club guy at college.


486
0:21:49,52 --> 0:21:53,36
He was quite interested in
this issue of connectivity.


487
0:21:53,36 --> 0:21:55,55
Ironically, under
their previous regime,


488
0:21:55,55 --> 0:21:57,865
you could get a satellite
dish, but you did that


489
0:21:57,865 --> 0:21:59,24
by getting it on
the black market


490
0:21:59,24 --> 0:22:1,72
from the Syrian military who
would happily sell you one


491
0:22:1,72 --> 0:22:4,95
and then track all your usage of
that satellite dish thereafter.


492
0:22:4,95 --> 0:22:7,98
But after 2000, there was this
period known as the Damascus


493
0:22:7,98 --> 0:22:12,64
Spring when Bashar al-Assad
through open electronic


494
0:22:12,64 --> 0:22:15,7
connectivity, and we
saw this massive surge


495
0:22:15,7 --> 0:22:17,96
in cell phone usage,
in internet access,


496
0:22:17,96 --> 0:22:19,57
in access to
satellite television.


497
0:22:19,57 --> 0:22:22,3
And actually if you
look at the other cities


498
0:22:22,3 --> 0:22:25,4
and other countries
involved in the Arab Spring,


499
0:22:25,4 --> 0:22:26,61
you see a very,
very similar pattern


500
0:22:26,61 --> 0:22:30,15
of this explosion of
connectivity after 2000.


501
0:22:30,15 --> 0:22:33,54
When the uprising came in
2011, that fundamentally


502
0:22:33,54 --> 0:22:37,4
changed the way that the
conflict developed in Syria.


503
0:22:37,4 --> 0:22:38,85
Unlike the 1980s
when the regime was


504
0:22:38,85 --> 0:22:42,34
able to crush one city at a time
because people didn't know what


505
0:22:42,34 --> 0:22:44,82
was going on, this
time people were


506
0:22:44,82 --> 0:22:45,99
able to talk to each other.


507
0:22:45,99 --> 0:22:49,86
And the uprising spread across
about half a dozen cities


508
0:22:49,86 --> 0:22:52,33
on the first day, and
it reached 20 cities


509
0:22:52,33 --> 0:22:53,7
in the first two weeks.


510
0:22:53,7 --> 0:22:56,9
And so the regime was not
able to get ahead of the curve


511
0:22:56,9 --> 0:22:56,694
this time.


512
0:22:56,694 --> 0:22:58,36
The other critical
difference that we've


513
0:22:58,36 --> 0:23:1,9
seen in all the Arab
Spring conflicts


514
0:23:1,9 --> 0:23:5,13
is the way that a tech savvy
connected population that


515
0:23:5,13 --> 0:23:8,75
is able to access technical
instructions but also


516
0:23:8,75 --> 0:23:11,33
physical manufacturing
facilities


517
0:23:11,33 --> 0:23:14,68
can rapidly generate
weaponry and capabilities


518
0:23:14,68 --> 0:23:18,29
that just weren't available
even a decade ago.


519
0:23:18,29 --> 0:23:21,29
And we can talk in more detail
in Q&A if you like about that.


520
0:23:21,29 --> 0:23:23,66
But I'll just give
you one example.


521
0:23:23,66 --> 0:23:27,72
In the Aleppo area-- which
is in northern Syria--


522
0:23:27,72 --> 0:23:31,91
last year, a bunch of guys
in the Syrian free army


523
0:23:31,91 --> 0:23:34,132
downloaded a bunch of
instructions off the internet


524
0:23:34,132 --> 0:23:36,34
and started producing their
own mortar systems, which


525
0:23:36,34 --> 0:23:40,3
they used Google Android
phones to control.


526
0:23:40,3 --> 0:23:44,94
They used the compass app and
a variety of calculation tables


527
0:23:44,94 --> 0:23:47,99
to decide where they're
going to fire those mortars.


528
0:23:47,99 --> 0:23:51,42
They look at Google Earth
as a way of targeting,


529
0:23:51,42 --> 0:23:55,84
and they'll use
access to the internet


530
0:23:55,84 --> 0:23:58,77
to basically pass messages
back and forth on Twitter


531
0:23:58,77 --> 0:24:2,7
to control the fall of shot.


532
0:24:2,7 --> 0:24:4,45
But also they
downloaded instructions


533
0:24:4,45 --> 0:24:7,16
that enabled them to build
their own army vehicles,


534
0:24:7,16 --> 0:24:10,682
so in a backyard
factory in Aleppo


535
0:24:10,682 --> 0:24:13,14
last year, a bunch of guys made
this thing called al-Shams,


536
0:24:13,14 --> 0:24:18,35
which is their lightweight tank
that has many mono chassis.


537
0:24:18,35 --> 0:24:21,49
It's about 6 feet long
and about 3 1/2 feet wide.


538
0:24:21,49 --> 0:24:24,19
It's controlled with a Game
Boy console from inside,


539
0:24:24,19 --> 0:24:26,7
and you look at a flat
screen television.


540
0:24:26,7 --> 0:24:27,861
It doesn't have a
turret, which is actually


541
0:24:27,861 --> 0:24:30,55
the most complicated piece of
an armored vehicle to build.


542
0:24:30,55 --> 0:24:33,3
Instead, it has a remote
control weapon station


543
0:24:33,3 --> 0:24:35,94
where they basically a
robot electric motor that


544
0:24:35,94 --> 0:24:38,36
controls the 7.62
millimeter machine


545
0:24:38,36 --> 0:24:39,89
gun that sits
outside the turret.


546
0:24:39,89 --> 0:24:42,64
And you've got a series
of armored video cameras


547
0:24:42,64 --> 0:24:44,74
that can be replaced
if they get broken that


548
0:24:44,74 --> 0:24:50,5
allow the thing to basically
run through a Go Pro


549
0:24:50,5 --> 0:24:52,0
to a Game Boy
controller, and the guy


550
0:24:52,0 --> 0:24:54,86
drives it around the
streets of Aleppo


551
0:24:54,86 --> 0:24:58,41
using basically home
consumer entertainment


552
0:24:58,41 --> 0:25:0,35
technology to control it.


553
0:25:0,35 --> 0:25:3,75
When I showed it to a bunch of
army guys earlier this year,


554
0:25:3,75 --> 0:25:7,374
they said to me, well, why would
you take all that technology


555
0:25:7,374 --> 0:25:9,54
and put it into this tiny
little army vehicle that's


556
0:25:9,54 --> 0:25:12,33
only 3 feet wide and 6 feet
long and it can't fight


557
0:25:12,33 --> 0:25:14,71
another tank, because it
only has a machine gun?


558
0:25:14,71 --> 0:25:17,35
Well, the reason is because
tanks can't get down


559
0:25:17,35 --> 0:25:19,51
streets in a place like Aleppo.


560
0:25:19,51 --> 0:25:22,41
A Bradley armored fighting
vehicle is about 16 feet wide,


561
0:25:22,41 --> 0:25:23,679
so is an Abrams tank.


562
0:25:23,679 --> 0:25:24,72
They're not getting that.


563
0:25:24,72 --> 0:25:27,33
They're not going to get
into that environment,


564
0:25:27,33 --> 0:25:28,73
and it doesn't need a big gun.


565
0:25:28,73 --> 0:25:31,11
It needs a small machine
gun for fighting infantry,


566
0:25:31,11 --> 0:25:32,61
because it's not
going to be dealing


567
0:25:32,61 --> 0:25:34,42
with large armored vehicles.


568
0:25:34,42 --> 0:25:38,5
So this is actually a very
smart technical adaptation


569
0:25:38,5 --> 0:25:41,85
of consumer electronics with
basically well understood


570
0:25:41,85 --> 0:25:45,5
internal combustion engine
and the application of fire


571
0:25:45,5 --> 0:25:46,5
in an urban environment.


572
0:25:46,5 --> 0:25:49,9
But what's interesting about
this is not the technology


573
0:25:49,9 --> 0:25:50,592
itself.


574
0:25:50,592 --> 0:25:52,55
It's the way that all
these people concentrated


575
0:25:52,55 --> 0:25:55,73
in an urban environment with
a high degree of connectivity


576
0:25:55,73 --> 0:25:58,68
have actually democratized
military technology


577
0:25:58,68 --> 0:25:59,41
on the ground.


578
0:25:59,41 --> 0:26:1,33
And the way these
conflicts have developed


579
0:26:1,33 --> 0:26:5,29
is very different from how
previous irregular warfare


580
0:26:5,29 --> 0:26:6,85
conflicts developed.


581
0:26:6,85 --> 0:26:9,78
I have case studies in
the book on that stuff


582
0:26:9,78 --> 0:26:11,52
and on things like
the Mumbai attack


583
0:26:11,52 --> 0:26:14,22
where the Lashkar-e-Taiba
terrorists from Pakistan


584
0:26:14,22 --> 0:26:16,48
used Twitter as
their control feed


585
0:26:16,48 --> 0:26:19,61
to actually control the attack
and used downloads of Google


586
0:26:19,61 --> 0:26:23,719
Earth to understand the flow of
the city and how to attack it.


587
0:26:23,719 --> 0:26:25,26
I have a bunch of
other case studies.


588
0:26:25,26 --> 0:26:26,85
Probably the most
interesting to me


589
0:26:26,85 --> 0:26:31,0
is actually the way that
Jamaican drug gangs in Kingston


590
0:26:31,0 --> 0:26:35,2
have used urban planning
decisions made in the 1960s


591
0:26:35,2 --> 0:26:38,33
to create these Garrison
districts around the outside


592
0:26:38,33 --> 0:26:40,72
of the city and control
international drug


593
0:26:40,72 --> 0:26:44,98
trade from slum areas around
the capital city of Jamaica.


594
0:26:44,98 --> 0:26:47,84
But let me finish by
talking about I think what's


595
0:26:47,84 --> 0:26:51,25
more germane to this discussion,
which is how do we model


596
0:26:51,25 --> 0:26:54,13
and understand
cities under stress.


597
0:26:54,13 --> 0:26:57,1
Because if I'm right
about the future,


598
0:26:57,1 --> 0:26:58,51
then the future
environment is going


599
0:26:58,51 --> 0:27:0,58
to be one of cities
that are experiencing


600
0:27:0,58 --> 0:27:4,87
this tsunami of inflow of
population, and information,


601
0:27:4,87 --> 0:27:7,19
and money, and drugs,
and weapons that


602
0:27:7,19 --> 0:27:9,781
come about through
rapid urbanization.


603
0:27:9,781 --> 0:27:12,28
And it's worth thinking about
how do we model and understand


604
0:27:12,28 --> 0:27:15,8
those and how do we think
about resiliencies to address


605
0:27:15,8 --> 0:27:17,85
those problems going forward.


606
0:27:17,85 --> 0:27:20,61
So briefly on that, in
looking at this in the book,


607
0:27:20,61 --> 0:27:22,63
I go back to Karl
Marx, weirdly enough.


608
0:27:22,63 --> 0:27:25,6
So Marx-- whatever
else he may have been--


609
0:27:25,6 --> 0:27:28,68
was a social scientist who's
looking at European cities


610
0:27:28,68 --> 0:27:31,92
100 years after the beginning
of that Industrial Revolution


611
0:27:31,92 --> 0:27:33,74
process that I was
talking about earlier.


612
0:27:33,74 --> 0:27:37,36
So in the 1850s, Marx is
looking at Paris, and Berlin,


613
0:27:37,36 --> 0:27:40,7
and London, and he's saying what
is it about these cities that


614
0:27:40,7 --> 0:27:44,0
gives rise to the
environment of urban squalor


615
0:27:44,0 --> 0:27:46,23
that is famously
written about by people


616
0:27:46,23 --> 0:27:48,5
like Victor Hugo
and Charles Dickens.


617
0:27:48,5 --> 0:27:50,42
What is it that
gives rise to that?


618
0:27:50,42 --> 0:27:53,63
And he talks about what
he calls a metabolic rift.


619
0:27:53,63 --> 0:27:55,57
So that people that
are used to living


620
0:27:55,57 --> 0:27:58,98
in a rural environment, where
most of the people that you


621
0:27:58,98 --> 0:28:2,0
rely on for day-to-day survival
are people that you're either


622
0:28:2,0 --> 0:28:4,25
related to or you
know personally.


623
0:28:4,25 --> 0:28:6,42
And you're in this
organic structure,


624
0:28:6,42 --> 0:28:9,12
you then find yourself in
a large urban environment


625
0:28:9,12 --> 0:28:10,93
where everything's
depersonalized,


626
0:28:10,93 --> 0:28:15,68
and you now rely on these large
institutionalized distanciated


627
0:28:15,68 --> 0:28:18,855
systems that are essentially
lots of moving parts


628
0:28:18,855 --> 0:28:21,84
that all have to work together,
or the whole thing falls over.


629
0:28:21,84 --> 0:28:24,64
And he talks about how that
creates this social rift


630
0:28:24,64 --> 0:28:26,43
in the way that people
look at each other,


631
0:28:26,43 --> 0:28:32,22
but it disassociates them
from the means of survival.


632
0:28:32,22 --> 0:28:35,72
This idea sits fallow in urban
planning for about 100 years,


633
0:28:35,72 --> 0:28:37,63
and then a guy called
Abel Wolman picks it up


634
0:28:37,63 --> 0:28:40,4
in the 1960s, who
was an urban planner,


635
0:28:40,4 --> 0:28:41,67
and he writes an
article that's actually


636
0:28:41,67 --> 0:28:44,3
very seminal in
urban ecology where


637
0:28:44,3 --> 0:28:46,69
he talks about the
metabolism of cities.


638
0:28:46,69 --> 0:28:49,62
And Wolman's argument is
pretty straightforward.


639
0:28:49,62 --> 0:28:51,36
It's like if you
imagine your body


640
0:28:51,36 --> 0:28:55,28
as a system with various inputs
and intakes of water, fuel,


641
0:28:55,28 --> 0:28:57,39
food, and so on that
come into your body,


642
0:28:57,39 --> 0:28:59,58
and there are
transformative processes


643
0:28:59,58 --> 0:29:2,95
that result in energy
and biomass and so on.


644
0:29:2,95 --> 0:29:5,155
But they also result
in toxins that


645
0:29:5,155 --> 0:29:7,34
have to be metabolized
and dealt with.


646
0:29:7,34 --> 0:29:10,47
And if your body doesn't
have the carrying capacity,


647
0:29:10,47 --> 0:29:14,11
the metabolic systems in place
to deal with those toxins,


648
0:29:14,11 --> 0:29:15,37
then you're going to get sick.


649
0:29:15,37 --> 0:29:18,0
He says you can apply
the same idea to a city.


650
0:29:18,0 --> 0:29:19,515
It has various
inputs and inflows


651
0:29:19,515 --> 0:29:22,17
and has various
transformative processes,


652
0:29:22,17 --> 0:29:25,85
and if the inflows overwhelm
the carrying capacity


653
0:29:25,85 --> 0:29:28,45
of the system, then you're going
to see the emergence of toxins


654
0:29:28,45 --> 0:29:33,2
that are going to result in
stuff like pollution-- air


655
0:29:33,2 --> 0:29:34,835
pollution, water
pollution, and so on.


656
0:29:34,835 --> 0:29:38,7
Now, this idea is
very common now


657
0:29:38,7 --> 0:29:41,43
in urban ecology in the
physical sense, carbon, water,


658
0:29:41,43 --> 0:29:44,5
air, how these things flow
through an urban system.


659
0:29:44,5 --> 0:29:46,1
And there are
models that we use,


660
0:29:46,1 --> 0:29:49,82
and there are material
flow analysis systems


661
0:29:49,82 --> 0:29:51,71
that we apply to
understand that.


662
0:29:51,71 --> 0:29:53,61
What I've done and what
a lot of other people


663
0:29:53,61 --> 0:29:56,78
have done in looking at cities
in the last 10 or 20 years


664
0:29:56,78 --> 0:29:59,83
is to do what I would call a
non-material flow analysis.


665
0:29:59,83 --> 0:30:1,93
So instead of looking
at water or carbon,


666
0:30:1,93 --> 0:30:5,8
we'll look at information, and
money, and people, and weapons,


667
0:30:5,8 --> 0:30:9,4
and drugs, and say does the
city have the carrying capacity


668
0:30:9,4 --> 0:30:12,51
to deal with those flows, or is
it in fact getting overwhelmed.


669
0:30:12,51 --> 0:30:15,33
And when you apply
those kinds of models


670
0:30:15,33 --> 0:30:17,62
to cities under
stress, it turns out


671
0:30:17,62 --> 0:30:20,6
you can start looking at
them in a very different way,


672
0:30:20,6 --> 0:30:23,27
and I can give you again some
examples in Q&A from places


673
0:30:23,27 --> 0:30:26,74
we've worked in Africa and
Latin America to understand


674
0:30:26,74 --> 0:30:29,83
how a city can be
seen as essentially


675
0:30:29,83 --> 0:30:32,79
a patent of intersecting
flows rather than just


676
0:30:32,79 --> 0:30:36,4
a piece of organized terrain.


677
0:30:36,4 --> 0:30:38,63
Modeling that, we
have found what


678
0:30:38,63 --> 0:30:43,68
relies on a combination of
big data, remote observation


679
0:30:43,68 --> 0:30:47,87
of honest signals from the urban
environment with field teams


680
0:30:47,87 --> 0:30:50,42
that can understand
what's beneath that data.


681
0:30:50,42 --> 0:30:52,48
So we did a lot of work
initially in Afghanistan,


682
0:30:52,48 --> 0:30:55,48
and then subsequently in Syria,
and in much of other places


683
0:30:55,48 --> 0:30:59,8
in looking at environments
that are under stress


684
0:30:59,8 --> 0:31:1,91
and trying to understand
what was going on


685
0:31:1,91 --> 0:31:3,94
by remote observation.


686
0:31:3,94 --> 0:31:6,21
After a while, we realized
that that doesn't actually


687
0:31:6,21 --> 0:31:9,36
give you the answer
you're looking for.


688
0:31:9,36 --> 0:31:12,9
It's like looking at a
jungle canopy from above.


689
0:31:12,9 --> 0:31:14,69
You can see the trees, but you
don't know what's underneath.


690
0:31:14,69 --> 0:31:16,565
And it turns out that
you have to put a field


691
0:31:16,565 --> 0:31:18,93
team on the ground
to figure out what


692
0:31:18,93 --> 0:31:21,92
is the delta between
the observed data


693
0:31:21,92 --> 0:31:23,69
and what you can
see on the ground


694
0:31:23,69 --> 0:31:26,27
before you can start to make
predictive analysis about what


695
0:31:26,27 --> 0:31:27,2
you're looking at.


696
0:31:27,2 --> 0:31:29,44
So I'll give you one example,
and unfortunately, Google


697
0:31:29,44 --> 0:31:31,648
doesn't come into this story,
because you guys charge


698
0:31:31,648 --> 0:31:33,38
for use of Google Earth data.


699
0:31:33,38 --> 0:31:36,14
But we used Open
Street Map, which


700
0:31:36,14 --> 0:31:39,93
is the Wiki version
of Google Earth


701
0:31:39,93 --> 0:31:41,91
to work with a series
of communities, mainly


702
0:31:41,91 --> 0:31:45,1
women's groups and a
violence observatory


703
0:31:45,1 --> 0:31:48,19
in a large African city
on a coastline that


704
0:31:48,19 --> 0:31:50,61
has a number of slums
that are experiencing


705
0:31:50,61 --> 0:31:52,31
a really high
degree of violence.


706
0:31:52,31 --> 0:31:53,935
Now, why women?


707
0:31:53,935 --> 0:31:55,31
One of the reasons
that women are


708
0:31:55,31 --> 0:31:56,972
really important in
this environment--


709
0:31:56,972 --> 0:31:58,18
there's actually two reasons.


710
0:31:58,18 --> 0:32:0,14
One is because they
are consistently


711
0:32:0,14 --> 0:32:2,27
excluded from the analysis.


712
0:32:2,27 --> 0:32:5,8
So when you go and start looking
at environments on the ground,


713
0:32:5,8 --> 0:32:9,61
typically you end up
speaking with elite class


714
0:32:9,61 --> 0:32:12,5
urban males that
speak English, which


715
0:32:12,5 --> 0:32:14,531
is a pretty small subset
of the environment


716
0:32:14,531 --> 0:32:16,3
actually when you
want to understand


717
0:32:16,3 --> 0:32:17,28
what's really going on.


718
0:32:17,28 --> 0:32:19,54
But much more
importantly in my view


719
0:32:19,54 --> 0:32:22,59
is that something
like 80% of the people


720
0:32:22,59 --> 0:32:25,95
that own businesses and
employ people in slums


721
0:32:25,95 --> 0:32:27,99
are actually women,
and the reason for that


722
0:32:27,99 --> 0:32:28,8
is pretty obvious.


723
0:32:28,8 --> 0:32:31,29
A lot of these slums
don't have a lot of jobs.


724
0:32:31,29 --> 0:32:32,97
Like if you live
in la Rocinha which


725
0:32:32,97 --> 0:32:36,7
is a favela outside
of Rio, you aren't


726
0:32:36,7 --> 0:32:37,76
going to work in la Rocinha.


727
0:32:37,76 --> 0:32:40,81
You're going to work downtown
where the rich people need you


728
0:32:40,81 --> 0:32:45,1
to sweep streets, and run
the airport traffic, baggage


729
0:32:45,1 --> 0:32:47,9
handling system, or drive taxis.


730
0:32:47,9 --> 0:32:50,17
That's where the work is if
you're a guy in la Rocinha.


731
0:32:50,17 --> 0:32:52,49
If you want to
work in the favela,


732
0:32:52,49 --> 0:32:54,59
and you want to run a business,
so you want to employ people,


733
0:32:54,59 --> 0:32:57,54
then you're probably
part of this network


734
0:32:57,54 --> 0:32:59,68
of women small business
owners that are actually


735
0:32:59,68 --> 0:33:1,517
pretty common in
these environments.


736
0:33:1,517 --> 0:33:3,1
So we worked with
these women's groups


737
0:33:3,1 --> 0:33:6,812
to understand threat
and risk in their slum.


738
0:33:6,812 --> 0:33:8,27
And if you think
about it, when you


739
0:33:8,27 --> 0:33:9,92
walk through an
urban environment,


740
0:33:9,92 --> 0:33:11,23
you don't know if you're
going to be mugged,


741
0:33:11,23 --> 0:33:13,8
but you do know if it
is going to happen,


742
0:33:13,8 --> 0:33:14,487
it'll probably be over there.


743
0:33:14,487 --> 0:33:16,32
There's just something
about the environment


744
0:33:16,32 --> 0:33:17,89
that tells you that it's risky.


745
0:33:17,89 --> 0:33:21,35
And we built a map which
essentially reflected


746
0:33:21,35 --> 0:33:24,9
the community's
perception of risk


747
0:33:24,9 --> 0:33:27,13
in different specific
areas within a slum.


748
0:33:27,13 --> 0:33:29,82
And it's interesting when you
compare that to the police data


749
0:33:29,82 --> 0:33:32,342
that the police have-- which
is again remote observation--


750
0:33:32,342 --> 0:33:33,8
you would think
that the government


751
0:33:33,8 --> 0:33:35,508
of a large African
city would know what's


752
0:33:35,508 --> 0:33:36,93
going on in its environment.


753
0:33:36,93 --> 0:33:37,999
Mostly they don't.


754
0:33:37,999 --> 0:33:39,54
You can look at
these things, and you


755
0:33:39,54 --> 0:33:41,79
can identify any building
off of Google Earth,


756
0:33:41,79 --> 0:33:43,79
but if you talk to somebody
from the government,


757
0:33:43,79 --> 0:33:45,79
it's pretty rare for them
to be able to tell you


758
0:33:45,79 --> 0:33:47,7
what that building is.


759
0:33:47,7 --> 0:33:48,82
Even if they know
what the building is,


760
0:33:48,82 --> 0:33:51,134
most of these streets
don't have street names.


761
0:33:51,134 --> 0:33:52,8
There are no house
addresses, so there's


762
0:33:52,8 --> 0:33:54,84
no way to record
that information.


763
0:33:54,84 --> 0:33:57,7
So we built these
special models of where


764
0:33:57,7 --> 0:33:59,72
the community felt unsafe,
and we began looking at them.


765
0:33:59,72 --> 0:34:3,584
We realized that actually these
places have a visual signature.


766
0:34:3,584 --> 0:34:5,5
There's something about
them that's different,


767
0:34:5,5 --> 0:34:7,95
the size of houses, the
number of bins in a given


768
0:34:7,95 --> 0:34:10,23
distance of road,
how wide the streets


769
0:34:10,23 --> 0:34:12,276
are, the density
of urban lighting.


770
0:34:12,276 --> 0:34:13,65
There's a whole
variety of things


771
0:34:13,65 --> 0:34:15,25
that make these
areas look different,


772
0:34:15,25 --> 0:34:17,98
and often humans can't tell
that, but machines can.


773
0:34:17,98 --> 0:34:21,55
And when you back up to a lot
of scale model or large scale


774
0:34:21,55 --> 0:34:23,78
picture, just a satellite
image of a city,


775
0:34:23,78 --> 0:34:26,122
you can start to pick these
environments off the map,


776
0:34:26,122 --> 0:34:27,83
because you know what
you're looking for,


777
0:34:27,83 --> 0:34:29,699
because you've done
the field work.


778
0:34:29,699 --> 0:34:32,34
So just the big
data is not enough,


779
0:34:32,34 --> 0:34:34,4
and just the field
work is not enough.


780
0:34:34,4 --> 0:34:36,62
The magic happens
at the connectivity


781
0:34:36,62 --> 0:34:39,28
between field teams that
understand the environment who


782
0:34:39,28 --> 0:34:43,32
are almost always entirely
indigenous local inhabitants


783
0:34:43,32 --> 0:34:46,19
of that environment and
people sitting remotely


784
0:34:46,19 --> 0:34:49,7
who can understand the
bigger large end perspective.


785
0:34:49,7 --> 0:34:52,27
And so a lot of what we do
now in places in Africa,


786
0:34:52,27 --> 0:34:54,409
and Latin America,
and the Middle East


787
0:34:54,409 --> 0:34:57,91
is founded on an idea
that we co-ed design


788
0:34:57,91 --> 0:35:1,68
where we bring a small external
team with certain kinds


789
0:35:1,68 --> 0:35:3,45
of technical or
functional knowledge


790
0:35:3,45 --> 0:35:5,95
into an environment
where they work closely


791
0:35:5,95 --> 0:35:8,85
under the direction of
the local community.


792
0:35:8,85 --> 0:35:11,57
And I'm going to take
this back to warfare.


793
0:35:11,57 --> 0:35:15,6
I really first
experienced that in Iraq


794
0:35:15,6 --> 0:35:17,4
when we finally
began to turn around


795
0:35:17,4 --> 0:35:18,64
what we'd been doing in Iraq.


796
0:35:18,64 --> 0:35:20,4
And I'm going to
end with this story,


797
0:35:20,4 --> 0:35:21,748
and then I'll throw
it open to questions.


798
0:35:21,748 --> 0:35:25,41
When I first went into Iraq
in 2006, we were in free fall.


799
0:35:25,41 --> 0:35:28,505
3,000 civilians were getting
killed in just Baghdad city


800
0:35:28,505 --> 0:35:30,2
alone e every week.


801
0:35:30,2 --> 0:35:32,53
That's a 9/11 every week.


802
0:35:32,53 --> 0:35:35,49
By September of 2007,
we'd reduced that


803
0:35:35,49 --> 0:35:38,8
to the point where a few people
getting killed was a bad night.


804
0:35:38,8 --> 0:35:41,0
100 was a terrible week.


805
0:35:41,0 --> 0:35:44,28
95% reduction in
violence in just


806
0:35:44,28 --> 0:35:47,45
a seven month period in Iraq.


807
0:35:47,45 --> 0:35:48,764
How did we do that?


808
0:35:48,764 --> 0:35:51,18
It wasn't because we had this
great new counter insurgency


809
0:35:51,18 --> 0:35:52,34
manual.


810
0:35:52,34 --> 0:35:53,48
That helped.


811
0:35:53,48 --> 0:35:56,23
I wasn't because we had a
president who was very engaged.


812
0:35:56,23 --> 0:35:58,75
Although, we wouldn't have been
able to do it without that.


813
0:35:58,75 --> 0:36:1,39
But actually it was because
we finally did something


814
0:36:1,39 --> 0:36:3,3
that we never
really done before,


815
0:36:3,3 --> 0:36:5,82
which is to actually start
talking to the Iraqis


816
0:36:5,82 --> 0:36:8,52
about how to defend
their neighborhoods.


817
0:36:8,52 --> 0:36:10,559
So before that, we
had typically gone


818
0:36:10,559 --> 0:36:13,1
into an Iraqi neighborhood, and
we would swept the locals out


819
0:36:13,1 --> 0:36:15,67
of the way, and we'd
say sit down, shut up.


820
0:36:15,67 --> 0:36:17,3
We have the answer
to your problem.


821
0:36:17,3 --> 0:36:19,51
We're going to back up
this democracy truck.


822
0:36:19,51 --> 0:36:21,47
We're going to
unpack the solution,


823
0:36:21,47 --> 0:36:23,9
and you guys will be very
happy with the result.


824
0:36:23,9 --> 0:36:25,472
And what had happened
was not that.


825
0:36:25,472 --> 0:36:27,93
What had happened was a city
that had basically torn itself


826
0:36:27,93 --> 0:36:32,45
apart for those 12 to 18
months before the surge began.


827
0:36:32,45 --> 0:36:35,1
And in that time,
interestingly the period


828
0:36:35,1 --> 0:36:39,45
when we backed off from
Baghdad, a lot of local security


829
0:36:39,45 --> 0:36:41,38
councils had emerged,
and people had


830
0:36:41,38 --> 0:36:44,2
started to create these
little security groups that


831
0:36:44,2 --> 0:36:45,592
decided we're
going to figure out


832
0:36:45,592 --> 0:36:47,8
how to defend our own
community and they had actually


833
0:36:47,8 --> 0:36:51,18
gone out and put in place
a whole series of systems,


834
0:36:51,18 --> 0:36:53,38
not just physical systems,
but reporting systems,


835
0:36:53,38 --> 0:36:55,54
and information
management systems,


836
0:36:55,54 --> 0:36:57,96
and ways of understanding
their environment,


837
0:36:57,96 --> 0:37:2,13
which they had used to
survive through most of 2006.


838
0:37:2,13 --> 0:37:6,41
So when we finally went
back in the spring of 2007


839
0:37:6,41 --> 0:37:8,39
and began to reengage
with Baghdad,


840
0:37:8,39 --> 0:37:10,1
this time we sat
down with people,


841
0:37:10,1 --> 0:37:13,78
and we said tell us what you've
been doing for the last year,


842
0:37:13,78 --> 0:37:15,81
and what's worked, and
what hasn't worked,


843
0:37:15,81 --> 0:37:18,19
and what you need some
additional help on,


844
0:37:18,19 --> 0:37:20,18
and what we should
just not touch,


845
0:37:20,18 --> 0:37:22,86
and you give us
this design brief


846
0:37:22,86 --> 0:37:24,92
of what we should
build to support


847
0:37:24,92 --> 0:37:26,81
your security in
your environment.


848
0:37:26,81 --> 0:37:28,95
And initially they
were like, what?


849
0:37:28,95 --> 0:37:31,54
Because I actually had a meeting
with some guys in a place


850
0:37:31,54 --> 0:37:33,559
called Sadr City where
they were like, what?


851
0:37:33,559 --> 0:37:34,85
You want to know what we think?


852
0:37:34,85 --> 0:37:35,91
They were like, dude,
we've been working


853
0:37:35,91 --> 0:37:37,47
with the Coalition
for four years.


854
0:37:37,47 --> 0:37:39,57
You're the first person
that's ever asked us


855
0:37:39,57 --> 0:37:41,89
what we think about how
to secure our district.


856
0:37:41,89 --> 0:37:43,59
And they were very,
very suspicious.


857
0:37:43,59 --> 0:37:46,214
When we finally began to do this
stuff-- and it wasn't just me,


858
0:37:46,214 --> 0:37:49,18
it was people all over
Iraq-- they got religion.


859
0:37:49,18 --> 0:37:51,4
Because they saw that
we really were serious.


860
0:37:51,4 --> 0:37:53,91
We were really going to listen
to what they wanted to do,


861
0:37:53,91 --> 0:37:55,326
and we're going
to work with them.


862
0:37:55,326 --> 0:37:57,49
And we engaged in this
process of co-design,


863
0:37:57,49 --> 0:37:59,4
and we actually
designed stuff together


864
0:37:59,4 --> 0:38:1,38
to build a solution that
would work for them.


865
0:38:1,38 --> 0:38:4,7
Now, there's companies here
in San Francisco like IDEO,


866
0:38:4,7 --> 0:38:6,55
for example, that
have this idea down


867
0:38:6,55 --> 0:38:9,93
in terms of participatory
development and urbanization,


868
0:38:9,93 --> 0:38:12,76
and they understand stuff
like human centered design


869
0:38:12,76 --> 0:38:14,74
as a way of engaging
with communities


870
0:38:14,74 --> 0:38:18,42
that are under stress to try
to build a better solution.


871
0:38:18,42 --> 0:38:21,31
My challenge to them and
what our company's been doing


872
0:38:21,31 --> 0:38:23,6
has been trying to
figure out how do you


873
0:38:23,6 --> 0:38:25,79
do that when people
are shooting at you.


874
0:38:25,79 --> 0:38:28,43
How do you do that when it's
so violent that you can't just


875
0:38:28,43 --> 0:38:30,806
sit down with people and say
hey man, what should we do?


876
0:38:30,806 --> 0:38:32,18
What are the ways
you can observe


877
0:38:32,18 --> 0:38:34,11
that environment
remotely, and how can you


878
0:38:34,11 --> 0:38:35,63
have field teams
working the ground


879
0:38:35,63 --> 0:38:38,25
to try to build-- what
for want of a better term


880
0:38:38,25 --> 0:38:41,38
I would call-- peace and
resilience in environments that


881
0:38:41,38 --> 0:38:44,57
are just not stable
by definition.


882
0:38:44,57 --> 0:38:48,66
These cities are growing at such
a rate that our traditional way


883
0:38:48,66 --> 0:38:51,79
of thinking about the problem,
which is to bring stability,


884
0:38:51,79 --> 0:38:53,712
to stabilize-- as
the IMF has it ,


885
0:38:53,712 --> 0:38:57,3
or to bring stability operations
as the military talks about is


886
0:38:57,3 --> 0:38:58,52
just not going to work.


887
0:38:58,52 --> 0:39:1,0
If you were born
in Daka in 1950,


888
0:39:1,0 --> 0:39:3,58
you would have been born in
a city of 400,000 people.


889
0:39:3,58 --> 0:39:5,32
Today that city's 12 million.


890
0:39:5,32 --> 0:39:8,35
It's going to be 25 million
by the middle of the century.


891
0:39:8,35 --> 0:39:10,8
It's not a stable system.


892
0:39:10,8 --> 0:39:12,24
Stability is a systems
characteristic.


893
0:39:12,24 --> 0:39:15,38
Resiliency is a characteristic
who's act is in the system.


894
0:39:15,38 --> 0:39:19,75
Rather than trying to hold back
the tide of rapid urbanization,


895
0:39:19,75 --> 0:39:22,27
we need to be focusing on
how to teach people to swim,


896
0:39:22,27 --> 0:39:24,22
and that's a lot of
what most people that


897
0:39:24,22 --> 0:39:26,26
are working in this
environment are now doing.


898
0:39:26,26 --> 0:39:29,27
So US Aid and a lot of
the other aid agencies


899
0:39:29,27 --> 0:39:31,74
have now a resiliency
agenda for how


900
0:39:31,74 --> 0:39:34,33
they're going to bring
the kind of systems


901
0:39:34,33 --> 0:39:36,38
to communities that
allow them to be


902
0:39:36,38 --> 0:39:38,87
resilient in the
face of rapid change.


903
0:39:38,87 --> 0:39:42,22
And I think circling back to
that Afghan ambush, that's


904
0:39:42,22 --> 0:39:44,21
what we need to be
looking at going forward,


905
0:39:44,21 --> 0:39:48,4
not remote rural mountainous
environments where you don't


906
0:39:48,4 --> 0:39:50,0
have a lot of
connectivity, and you


907
0:39:50,0 --> 0:39:52,4
don't have a high
population density.


908
0:39:52,4 --> 0:39:54,96
We've become really,
really good at operating


909
0:39:54,96 --> 0:39:56,72
in that environment
in the last decade,


910
0:39:56,72 --> 0:39:58,72
but the future
environment is not that.


911
0:39:58,72 --> 0:40:2,7
It's big cities on
coastlines in the developing


912
0:40:2,7 --> 0:40:4,91
world with an enormous
degree of connectivity,


913
0:40:4,91 --> 0:40:8,49
and there's a massive
upside set of opportunities


914
0:40:8,49 --> 0:40:11,29
to lift people out of poverty,
to bring all kinds of benefits


915
0:40:11,29 --> 0:40:13,61
to communities that
don't have them now,


916
0:40:13,61 --> 0:40:16,47
to actually generate peace
as this thing from just


917
0:40:16,47 --> 0:40:18,77
the absence of conflict.


918
0:40:18,77 --> 0:40:22,87
That opportunity is there
alongside a huge set


919
0:40:22,87 --> 0:40:25,56
of risks that will confront
us if we don't deal


920
0:40:25,56 --> 0:40:28,6
with this massive population
tsunami that's bearing down


921
0:40:28,6 --> 0:40:31,78
on coastal cities in
the next generation.


922
0:40:31,78 --> 0:40:33,487
So let me stop
there and summarize


923
0:40:33,487 --> 0:40:35,82
by saying we need to get our
heads out of the mountains,


924
0:40:35,82 --> 0:40:39,48
and start thinking about this
future urban environment.


925
0:40:39,48 --> 0:40:41,94
And I'm going to throw the
floor open to questions,


926
0:40:41,94 --> 0:40:43,44
so I don't know how
you want to run.


927
0:40:43,44 --> 0:40:46,2
If you guys want to nominate,
and we'll go from there.


928
0:40:46,2 --> 0:40:48,8
AUDIENCE: When we
were speaking earlier,


929
0:40:48,8 --> 0:40:52,449
you had talked about inoculating
cities with some resiliency


930
0:40:52,449 --> 0:40:54,24
as they're going through
this rapid growth.


931
0:40:54,24 --> 0:40:56,365
Could you talk a little
bit more about that please?


932
0:40:56,365 --> 0:40:58,575
DAVID KILCULLEN: So
great point, Chris.


933
0:40:58,575 --> 0:41:3,29
So, we're not just talking
about cities that are there now.


934
0:41:3,29 --> 0:41:5,78
One projection by
the Indian Institute


935
0:41:5,78 --> 0:41:9,23
for Human Settlements-- which is
like their heart organization--


936
0:41:9,23 --> 0:41:11,59
is that the entire
west coast of India


937
0:41:11,59 --> 0:41:15,56
is going to be one single
giant conurbation by 2040.


938
0:41:15,56 --> 0:41:19,82
So large slums will fill in
the currently existing space


939
0:41:19,82 --> 0:41:21,19
between existing cities.


940
0:41:21,19 --> 0:41:23,66
There's a guy called
Mike Davis out in Hawaii


941
0:41:23,66 --> 0:41:26,26
who's written a number of
really good books, one which


942
0:41:26,26 --> 0:41:29,92
is called "Planet of Slums"
where he projects that we're


943
0:41:29,92 --> 0:41:33,1
going to see this
giant slum spoil fill


944
0:41:33,1 --> 0:41:35,15
in the space between
existing cities.


945
0:41:35,15 --> 0:41:39,204
So there's paradoxes that a lot
of the problems of urbanization


946
0:41:39,204 --> 0:41:41,12
that we're going to see
in the next generation


947
0:41:41,12 --> 0:41:44,374
are going to happen in
cities that aren't there yet,


948
0:41:44,374 --> 0:41:45,79
because they haven't
happened yet.


949
0:41:45,79 --> 0:41:48,19
And so part of this is about
getting ahead of the curve


950
0:41:48,19 --> 0:41:51,95
and thinking about what do
these kinds of environments


951
0:41:51,95 --> 0:41:55,23
need to channel them into a
pathway of urban development


952
0:41:55,23 --> 0:41:57,33
that's going to result
in a different future.


953
0:41:57,33 --> 0:42:1,26
And I'm trying in the book not
to predict a dystopian view.


954
0:42:1,26 --> 0:42:3,37
If you want that,
go read "Snow Crash"


955
0:42:3,37 --> 0:42:5,68
by Neal Stephenson,
which is 15 years old,


956
0:42:5,68 --> 0:42:8,57
but it's all there
in California.


957
0:42:8,57 --> 0:42:12,75
So this stuff's been figured out
as a dystopian vision already.


958
0:42:12,75 --> 0:42:15,18
What I'm doing is
making a projection


959
0:42:15,18 --> 0:42:17,84
based on current
data and saying it


960
0:42:17,84 --> 0:42:19,31
doesn't have to be that future.


961
0:42:19,31 --> 0:42:20,8
It can actually be different.


962
0:42:20,8 --> 0:42:23,69
And I think it's about thinking
about where will cities grow to


963
0:42:23,69 --> 0:42:27,4
and what happens when rapid
unchecked urban growth acretes


964
0:42:27,4 --> 0:42:28,91
around an existing city.


965
0:42:28,91 --> 0:42:31,96
So you get this donut shaped
or horseshoe shaped ring


966
0:42:31,96 --> 0:42:35,49
of terrain that clusters
around an existing city,


967
0:42:35,49 --> 0:42:37,97
but it didn't used
to be empty terrain.


968
0:42:37,97 --> 0:42:39,86
That's where the
city grew its food.


969
0:42:39,86 --> 0:42:41,637
It's where the water
catchment area was.


970
0:42:41,637 --> 0:42:43,47
It's where a lot of the
transportation roots


971
0:42:43,47 --> 0:42:44,37
come through.


972
0:42:44,37 --> 0:42:46,12
So you have this
ring of slums that


973
0:42:46,12 --> 0:42:48,24
emerge around a
city that separates


974
0:42:48,24 --> 0:42:51,4
the city from the sources of
all those critical commodities,


975
0:42:51,4 --> 0:42:54,61
the inflows of the metabolism
that it needs to survive.


976
0:42:54,61 --> 0:42:56,35
And these are areas
where you don't


977
0:42:56,35 --> 0:42:57,857
have a lot of
government presence.


978
0:42:57,857 --> 0:42:59,69
You don't have a lot
of government services.


979
0:42:59,69 --> 0:43:2,48
And so non-state
armed groups often


980
0:43:2,48 --> 0:43:5,34
emerge and end up controlling
these environments,


981
0:43:5,34 --> 0:43:7,77
and they don't
just smuggle drugs.


982
0:43:7,77 --> 0:43:11,43
They actually provide governance
services in these environments.


983
0:43:11,43 --> 0:43:15,6
And it's typical of governments
to look at these as a threat.


984
0:43:15,6 --> 0:43:16,53
I don't see them
that way at all.


985
0:43:16,53 --> 0:43:18,28
These are people who
are engaging in stuff


986
0:43:18,28 --> 0:43:19,988
that the government
either can't or won't


987
0:43:19,988 --> 0:43:21,76
do that the population needs.


988
0:43:21,76 --> 0:43:24,15
They're actually fulfilling
a central function


989
0:43:24,15 --> 0:43:25,9
to the existence of
the city, but what


990
0:43:25,9 --> 0:43:28,662
it means if you're an
urban politician downtown


991
0:43:28,662 --> 0:43:30,37
is there's now a ring
of territory that's


992
0:43:30,37 --> 0:43:33,38
like a gauntlet around the
city, and all the supplies


993
0:43:33,38 --> 0:43:34,96
that the city needs
to survive have


994
0:43:34,96 --> 0:43:37,7
to run that gauntlet
every day, and there's


995
0:43:37,7 --> 0:43:40,18
a non-state armed group, a
malitia, or a communitarian


996
0:43:40,18 --> 0:43:41,599
group that's sitting
astride that.


997
0:43:41,599 --> 0:43:43,64
And you're going to have
to deal with that group,


998
0:43:43,64 --> 0:43:46,32
because if you don't, they
can shut the city down.


999
0:43:46,32 --> 0:43:48,23
So I think it's stuff like that.


1000
0:43:48,23 --> 0:43:53,4
It's understanding how
do we enable urban growth


1001
0:43:53,4 --> 0:43:54,98
in a way that isn't
going to generate


1002
0:43:54,98 --> 0:43:57,58
the kind of urban exclusion,
and marginalization,


1003
0:43:57,58 --> 0:44:0,37
and political disposition
of these people


1004
0:44:0,37 --> 0:44:4,35
that then creates the ground
in which all this stuff takes


1005
0:44:4,35 --> 0:44:4,9
place.


1006
0:44:4,9 --> 0:44:7,2
And for the military
guys, how are we


1007
0:44:7,2 --> 0:44:10,46
going to operate in giant
cities like this which


1008
0:44:10,46 --> 0:44:12,88
could absorb a marine regiment
or an army division and not


1009
0:44:12,88 --> 0:44:14,34
even notice?


1010
0:44:14,34 --> 0:44:17,47
It's going to have to be
different from the traditional


1011
0:44:17,47 --> 0:44:19,6
way that we've thought
about operational maneuver


1012
0:44:19,6 --> 0:44:21,69
from the sea or
maneuver operational


1013
0:44:21,69 --> 0:44:24,9
in a littoral environment,
because it's just so big now


1014
0:44:24,9 --> 0:44:26,49
that you're looking at
a whole different space.


1015
0:44:26,49 --> 0:44:27,423
A lot more to talk
about on that,


1016
0:44:27,423 --> 0:44:29,5
but I think getting
ahead of the curve


1017
0:44:29,5 --> 0:44:31,1
is about predicting where
the problem is going


1018
0:44:31,1 --> 0:44:33,41
to be in cities that
haven't even happened yet


1019
0:44:33,41 --> 0:44:37,37
and how do you understand
the resiliences that prevent


1020
0:44:37,37 --> 0:44:40,21
this kind of symptoms
from developing


1021
0:44:40,21 --> 0:44:42,79
and to stop them
in their tracks.


1022
0:44:42,79 --> 0:44:44,64
AUDIENCE: Thanks for coming.


1023
0:44:44,64 --> 0:44:45,22
Let's see.


1024
0:44:45,22 --> 0:44:48,75
Max Boot spoke here recently.


1025
0:44:48,75 --> 0:44:51,15
He's the author of the
book on guerrilla warfare.


1026
0:44:51,15 --> 0:44:52,72
And at one point
he said-- I think


1027
0:44:52,72 --> 0:44:56,28
I'm quoting him right--
that urban areas were not


1028
0:44:56,28 --> 0:45:0,65
very friendly for
guerrillas, and his reason


1029
0:45:0,65 --> 0:45:4,55
was that it's too exposed.


1030
0:45:4,55 --> 0:45:6,16
You can't have
meetings and organize.


1031
0:45:6,16 --> 0:45:9,44
You can't do rifle practice.


1032
0:45:9,44 --> 0:45:10,365
Clearly you disagree.


1033
0:45:10,365 --> 0:45:12,24
Do you think that's a
factor, or [INAUDIBLE]?


1034
0:45:12,24 --> 0:45:14,31
DAVID KILCULLEN: Well,
I think Max was just


1035
0:45:14,31 --> 0:45:15,84
a great book in his
latest book, and I


1036
0:45:15,84 --> 0:45:17,673
have a lot of respect
for his point of view.


1037
0:45:17,673 --> 0:45:20,94
And I think if you look at
the big sweep of history


1038
0:45:20,94 --> 0:45:22,26
of guerrillas, which is
what he's doing in the book,


1039
0:45:22,26 --> 0:45:25,18
he's right that traditionally
guerrillas don't operate


1040
0:45:25,18 --> 0:45:27,87
in cities and haven't had
a great degree of success


1041
0:45:27,87 --> 0:45:28,649
in cities.


1042
0:45:28,649 --> 0:45:30,19
And the reason for
that is guerrillas


1043
0:45:30,19 --> 0:45:32,31
go to where the cover is.


1044
0:45:32,31 --> 0:45:33,77
They go to where they can hide.


1045
0:45:33,77 --> 0:45:35,311
And for most of
human history, that's


1046
0:45:35,311 --> 0:45:37,311
been mountains and
jungles, but today we


1047
0:45:37,311 --> 0:45:39,81
have foliage penetrating radar
that can see through jungles.


1048
0:45:39,81 --> 0:45:42,63
And we've got drones that can
sit on top of a mountain range


1049
0:45:42,63 --> 0:45:45,39
24 hours a day and tell
you where the bad guys are.


1050
0:45:45,39 --> 0:45:49,1
There's not a lot of cover in
the rural environment anymore.


1051
0:45:49,1 --> 0:45:50,475
The cover is in the cities.


1052
0:45:50,475 --> 0:45:51,85
And there's another
key idea that


1053
0:45:51,85 --> 0:45:54,12
comes in here, which is
the idea of legibility.


1054
0:45:54,12 --> 0:45:56,19
So there's a great
guy up at Yale


1055
0:45:56,19 --> 0:45:58,86
called James C. Scott
who's a professor.


1056
0:45:58,86 --> 0:46:1,7
I don't think you can be
a professor of [INAUDIBLE]


1057
0:46:1,7 --> 0:46:3,32
studies, but that's
basically what he is.


1058
0:46:3,32 --> 0:46:4,87
And he wrote an
awesome book called


1059
0:46:4,87 --> 0:46:8,1
"Seeing Like a State"
where he talks about how


1060
0:46:8,1 --> 0:46:9,67
what governments
try to do is they


1061
0:46:9,67 --> 0:46:11,59
try to make
environments legible,


1062
0:46:11,59 --> 0:46:13,79
so they can read and interpret.


1063
0:46:13,79 --> 0:46:15,9
And if you work in
Google, you basically work


1064
0:46:15,9 --> 0:46:17,72
in a giant legibility
project, trying


1065
0:46:17,72 --> 0:46:20,67
to make the entire planet
legible so the people can


1066
0:46:20,67 --> 0:46:23,91
understand that and
do things with it.


1067
0:46:23,91 --> 0:46:27,71
There are huge parts of the
planet that are not legible,


1068
0:46:27,71 --> 0:46:30,15
and most of those places
now are in cities.


1069
0:46:30,15 --> 0:46:33,2
They're not in well developed
well designed cities.


1070
0:46:33,2 --> 0:46:35,54
They're in these
clusters of slums


1071
0:46:35,54 --> 0:46:36,47
where there's no
street addresses,


1072
0:46:36,47 --> 0:46:38,88
and there's no house numbers,
and you can spot a building


1073
0:46:38,88 --> 0:46:40,77
from space, but you
don't know what's there,


1074
0:46:40,77 --> 0:46:42,91
and there's no way to
understand who lives there.


1075
0:46:42,91 --> 0:46:46,1
Now that we have things like
GDELT-- the global database


1076
0:46:46,1 --> 0:46:47,78
of events, language,
and tone-- which


1077
0:46:47,78 --> 0:46:49,79
has been built for
about 15 years or so,


1078
0:46:49,79 --> 0:46:53,18
and we have Twitter feeds
that we can geolocate.


1079
0:46:53,18 --> 0:46:56,5
There's things that are emerging
that allow us to make cities


1080
0:46:56,5 --> 0:46:59,7
more legible than
they'd been in the past.


1081
0:46:59,7 --> 0:47:1,78
But I believe the
balance has shifted


1082
0:47:1,78 --> 0:47:3,59
so that the urban
environment is now


1083
0:47:3,59 --> 0:47:6,81
the safer environment for
irregular operators compared


1084
0:47:6,81 --> 0:47:8,71
to the countryside.


1085
0:47:8,71 --> 0:47:11,609
That doesn't mean we won't
see conflict in the mountains


1086
0:47:11,609 --> 0:47:12,4
and in the jungles.


1087
0:47:12,4 --> 0:47:13,94
We most definitely will.


1088
0:47:13,94 --> 0:47:17,379
But irregular conflict tends
to happen where people live.


1089
0:47:17,379 --> 0:47:18,92
The vast majority
of people are going


1090
0:47:18,92 --> 0:47:21,85
to be in urban environments,
and the city now


1091
0:47:21,85 --> 0:47:23,29
is the area where
you've got more


1092
0:47:23,29 --> 0:47:25,34
cover than the
rural environment.


1093
0:47:25,34 --> 0:47:28,99
So I think Max is right as a
historical statement about what


1094
0:47:28,99 --> 0:47:30,93
the history of irregular
conflict has been,


1095
0:47:30,93 --> 0:47:34,73
but I think we're at a watershed
where going forward we're


1096
0:47:34,73 --> 0:47:38,42
going to see increasing
preponderance of this kind


1097
0:47:38,42 --> 0:47:41,16
of conflict happening
not in downtown cities,


1098
0:47:41,16 --> 0:47:44,4
but in slums and in this ring
of uncontrolled illegible


1099
0:47:44,4 --> 0:47:46,106
territory around the outside.


1100
0:47:46,106 --> 0:47:47,48
AUDIENCE: So you
talk about where


1101
0:47:47,48 --> 0:47:49,94
you think the slums are going
to grow and try to get ahead


1102
0:47:49,94 --> 0:47:53,53
of it, but it seems like any
service you do in that area


1103
0:47:53,53 --> 0:47:55,46
before the slums is
just going to draw


1104
0:47:55,46 --> 0:47:58,51
the people there and
bring the slum sooner.


1105
0:47:58,51 --> 0:48:0,24
If you put schools
and parks, you're


1106
0:48:0,24 --> 0:48:3,5
just going to end up with
slums at the schools and parks.


1107
0:48:3,5 --> 0:48:5,11
How do you get ahead of it?


1108
0:48:5,11 --> 0:48:7,67
The real problem is
just too much people


1109
0:48:7,67 --> 0:48:9,18
with not enough jobs.


1110
0:48:9,18 --> 0:48:10,1
DAVID KILCULLEN: Right,
that's a great point.


1111
0:48:10,1 --> 0:48:12,24
In fact, there's a woman
called Sheela Patel who


1112
0:48:12,24 --> 0:48:15,14
runs an organization
called SPARC in Mumbai who


1113
0:48:15,14 --> 0:48:15,94
makes this point.


1114
0:48:15,94 --> 0:48:19,78
She says the government has
decided not to provide services


1115
0:48:19,78 --> 0:48:22,82
to people in slums,
because they think


1116
0:48:22,82 --> 0:48:24,57
it's going to attract
people to the slums.


1117
0:48:24,57 --> 0:48:26,78
One of the great examples
of that is sanitation.


1118
0:48:26,78 --> 0:48:29,5
So the Indian government
says that an acceptable level


1119
0:48:29,5 --> 0:48:32,83
of sanitation is one
toilet per 50 people.


1120
0:48:32,83 --> 0:48:35,47
Right now it's one
toilet per 600 people


1121
0:48:35,47 --> 0:48:37,43
in many of the slums in Mumbai.


1122
0:48:37,43 --> 0:48:39,83
And she says as if
people moved to slums


1123
0:48:39,83 --> 0:48:42,35
just because they want
access to a toilet.


1124
0:48:42,35 --> 0:48:44,8
There's plenty of places
to crap in the woods.


1125
0:48:44,8 --> 0:48:46,67
Actually people are
moving to cities


1126
0:48:46,67 --> 0:48:48,68
because of economic opportunity.


1127
0:48:48,68 --> 0:48:50,59
And I also think--
and we see this


1128
0:48:50,59 --> 0:48:53,6
in a number of places--
because of the connectivity


1129
0:48:53,6 --> 0:48:55,25
differential between
rural environments


1130
0:48:55,25 --> 0:48:57,42
and the urban
environment, if now


1131
0:48:57,42 --> 0:49:0,61
the way that you make
your money is by access


1132
0:49:0,61 --> 0:49:3,23
to a globalized economy
and you need connectivity


1133
0:49:3,23 --> 0:49:5,587
to do that and there's a
connectivity differential


1134
0:49:5,587 --> 0:49:7,67
between the rural environment
where you don't have


1135
0:49:7,67 --> 0:49:10,76
that connectivity and the
urban environment when you do,


1136
0:49:10,76 --> 0:49:13,379
then one of the major reasons
why people are moving to cities


1137
0:49:13,379 --> 0:49:14,92
is because that's
where the Wi-Fi is.


1138
0:49:14,92 --> 0:49:16,28
That's where the internet is.


1139
0:49:16,28 --> 0:49:18,238
That's where the density
of cell phone coverage


1140
0:49:18,238 --> 0:49:20,88
is that allows you to tap
into that environment.


1141
0:49:20,88 --> 0:49:22,39
So I think that
tells you that there


1142
0:49:22,39 --> 0:49:25,47
are three ways to
really address this.


1143
0:49:25,47 --> 0:49:28,76
One is to attack
the supply side,


1144
0:49:28,76 --> 0:49:31,46
to do things in the
rural environment that


1145
0:49:31,46 --> 0:49:34,16
make it better for people that
are there so that they don't


1146
0:49:34,16 --> 0:49:37,6
decide we're going to pick up
and move to urban environments


1147
0:49:37,6 --> 0:49:38,67
at quite the same rate.


1148
0:49:38,67 --> 0:49:42,49
So more rural Wi-Fi, better
access to cell phones


1149
0:49:42,49 --> 0:49:47,34
in the countryside, water,
sanitation, education, conflict


1150
0:49:47,34 --> 0:49:48,94
resolution in the
kinds of conflicts


1151
0:49:48,94 --> 0:49:50,69
we were talking about
here that will still


1152
0:49:50,69 --> 0:49:54,84
happen in the rural
environment, there's


1153
0:49:54,84 --> 0:49:58,63
a supply side problem
of how do you address


1154
0:49:58,63 --> 0:50:0,32
people deciding to
move to the city.


1155
0:50:0,32 --> 0:50:2,93
Then in the city itself,
there are all these resiliency


1156
0:50:2,93 --> 0:50:5,81
interventions that you
can undertake in order


1157
0:50:5,81 --> 0:50:9,12
to make it hard of a
conflict to break out,


1158
0:50:9,12 --> 0:50:12,12
to create ways to resolve
that conflict quicker,


1159
0:50:12,12 --> 0:50:15,1
and to bring in the kinds of
services that prevent conflicts


1160
0:50:15,1 --> 0:50:16,79
from developing in
the first place.


1161
0:50:16,79 --> 0:50:19,16
So they're the demand
side, or how do you


1162
0:50:19,16 --> 0:50:22,81
increase the carrying capacity
of an urban system in such


1163
0:50:22,81 --> 0:50:24,274
a way that it can
handle the flow?


1164
0:50:24,274 --> 0:50:25,44
But then ultimately, though,


1165
0:50:25,44 --> 0:50:28,34
AUDIENCE: I think
nothing we can do


1166
0:50:28,34 --> 0:50:32,4
is going to stop the giant
tendency of populations


1167
0:50:32,4 --> 0:50:33,59
to move to urban environments.


1168
0:50:33,59 --> 0:50:36,882
It's more about helping
people cope better


1169
0:50:36,882 --> 0:50:38,59
with the environment
they find themselves


1170
0:50:38,59 --> 0:50:42,312
in than about
turning off the tap.


1171
0:50:42,312 --> 0:50:44,77
AUDIENCE: I just have trouble
seeing how to grow resiliency


1172
0:50:44,77 --> 0:50:48,27
when it means a slum is stronger
because more people live there.


1173
0:50:48,27 --> 0:50:50,82
I mean, that's resiliency
in the anti-fragile sense.


1174
0:50:50,82 --> 0:50:53,736
You get stronger because
more people come.


1175
0:50:53,736 --> 0:50:54,86
I don't see how to do that.


1176
0:50:54,86 --> 0:50:55,77
DAVID KILCULLEN:
There's actually-- well,


1177
0:50:55,77 --> 0:50:57,73
you should buy my book
then, because there's


1178
0:50:57,73 --> 0:50:59,9
a lot of case studies in there.


1179
0:50:59,9 --> 0:51:2,28
In the last chapter, I look
at several examples of things


1180
0:51:2,28 --> 0:51:6,3
that I think suggest
ways to think about this.


1181
0:51:6,3 --> 0:51:7,99
I would just say
I'm not suggesting


1182
0:51:7,99 --> 0:51:9,24
that I have the answer.


1183
0:51:9,24 --> 0:51:11,609
What I'm doing is
pointing to two things.


1184
0:51:11,609 --> 0:51:13,4
One is there's this
problem out there which


1185
0:51:13,4 --> 0:51:15,84
we need to be
thinking about, and I


1186
0:51:15,84 --> 0:51:16,75
think that actually
in the urban studies


1187
0:51:16,75 --> 0:51:19,48
environment and actually a lot
of people in the data science


1188
0:51:19,48 --> 0:51:22,19
community, people are
already thinking about that.


1189
0:51:22,19 --> 0:51:24,18
But the military's
been sidetracked


1190
0:51:24,18 --> 0:51:26,74
into this other environment
for the last decade,


1191
0:51:26,74 --> 0:51:28,84
and as we come back out
of that environment,


1192
0:51:28,84 --> 0:51:31,27
I think we have to put that
conversation back together


1193
0:51:31,27 --> 0:51:35,35
again and have people that
really understand military,


1194
0:51:35,35 --> 0:51:37,5
and law enforcement,
and all those kinds


1195
0:51:37,5 --> 0:51:39,82
of other kinds of operations
in the environment,


1196
0:51:39,82 --> 0:51:41,62
reengage with a
debate that's actually


1197
0:51:41,62 --> 0:51:44,2
moved on a lot in
the last 12 years


1198
0:51:44,2 --> 0:51:46,802
while we've been
busy in Afghanistan.


1199
0:51:46,802 --> 0:51:49,1
And the other thing that I
think it is to reemphasize


1200
0:51:49,1 --> 0:51:52,15
is you have littoral,
because being on a coastline


1201
0:51:52,15 --> 0:51:55,36
is different from being
in a city elsewhere.


1202
0:51:55,36 --> 0:51:57,22
Just one example
of that, last year


1203
0:51:57,22 --> 0:51:58,83
for the first time
in history, there


1204
0:51:58,83 --> 0:52:2,29
was a simultaneous outbreak of
cholera in four West African


1205
0:52:2,29 --> 0:52:4,7
countries during
the monsoon season,


1206
0:52:4,7 --> 0:52:6,48
and the reason
for that is people


1207
0:52:6,48 --> 0:52:8,91
have moved to slums on the
outskirts of these cities.


1208
0:52:8,91 --> 0:52:12,22
A lot of those slums are
built on stilts over the sea.


1209
0:52:12,22 --> 0:52:13,79
They don't have sanitation.


1210
0:52:13,79 --> 0:52:17,66
There was a tidal storm surge
that pushed a lot of sewage


1211
0:52:17,66 --> 0:52:21,63
from these slums into the inland
water system and infected lots


1212
0:52:21,63 --> 0:52:24,67
of people with cholera,
but all these cities


1213
0:52:24,67 --> 0:52:27,7
are connected with each other
through coastal shipping


1214
0:52:27,7 --> 0:52:31,3
and air transportation so that
the infection spread nearly


1215
0:52:31,3 --> 0:52:32,6
simultaneously.


1216
0:52:32,6 --> 0:52:34,226
There's a very interesting
study by the World Health


1217
0:52:34,226 --> 0:52:37,77
Organization where they look
at how air travel in particular


1218
0:52:37,77 --> 0:52:40,85
completely invalidates our
traditional way of handling


1219
0:52:40,85 --> 0:52:41,93
infectious disease.


1220
0:52:41,93 --> 0:52:45,83
If you have the right
incubation period


1221
0:52:45,83 --> 0:52:51,8
and you posit the idea of a
continued air traffic system,


1222
0:52:51,8 --> 0:52:53,18
it can be around
the entire system


1223
0:52:53,18 --> 0:52:55,15
before the first
patient gets sick.


1224
0:52:55,15 --> 0:52:58,7
So instead of having breakout
in one country and you then


1225
0:52:58,7 --> 0:53:1,25
contain that, you can
have simultaneous outbreak


1226
0:53:1,25 --> 0:53:3,87
in basically every continent
except Antarctica because


1227
0:53:3,87 --> 0:53:6,22
of the way the air
transportation system works.


1228
0:53:6,22 --> 0:53:9,8
Who runs baggage handling
systems in most of the world?


1229
0:53:9,8 --> 0:53:11,16
Who is the workforce
in most airports?


1230
0:53:11,16 --> 0:53:13,82
It's people that don't live in
the rich districts downtown.


1231
0:53:13,82 --> 0:53:16,18
It's people that live in the
slums around the outside.


1232
0:53:16,18 --> 0:53:18,65
So I think this is the
sort of stuff where


1233
0:53:18,65 --> 0:53:21,855
we need to be really engaging to
think about how do we get ahead


1234
0:53:21,855 --> 0:53:23,49
of the curve, and maybe we can.


1235
0:53:23,49 --> 0:53:24,82
Maybe you're right.


1236
0:53:24,82 --> 0:53:27,18
I hope that's not true,
but it's at least worth


1237
0:53:27,18 --> 0:53:28,39
thinking about it I think.


1238
0:53:28,39 --> 0:53:30,26
AUDIENCE: Hey,
thanks for coming.


1239
0:53:30,26 --> 0:53:33,64
I wanted to ask about if we
have this large population


1240
0:53:33,64 --> 0:53:36,32
growth over the next 30 years,
have all these people moving


1241
0:53:36,32 --> 0:53:39,8
into cities and
then simultaneously


1242
0:53:39,8 --> 0:53:42,12
from other people, particularly
like futurists like Peter


1243
0:53:42,12 --> 0:53:44,67
Diamandis and such who have
these ideas that talk about


1244
0:53:44,67 --> 0:53:46,6
well, we'll have more
and more technology.


1245
0:53:46,6 --> 0:53:49,39
We'll have to stop worrying
about low level agriculture


1246
0:53:49,39 --> 0:53:54,6
so much as more of that's--
we'll just say-- automated.


1247
0:53:54,6 --> 0:53:58,7
So I was wondering if you had
any thoughts on what the job


1248
0:53:58,7 --> 0:54:0,98
or what the working situation
looks like for people


1249
0:54:0,98 --> 0:54:4,9
in these cities as we get
these giant populations.


1250
0:54:4,9 --> 0:54:6,224
DAVID KILCULLEN:
Yeah, I've looked


1251
0:54:6,224 --> 0:54:7,64
at that in a little
bit of detail,


1252
0:54:7,64 --> 0:54:10,7
but not actually as
much as I would like to.


1253
0:54:10,7 --> 0:54:12,65
I think there's a whole
additional study here


1254
0:54:12,65 --> 0:54:17,95
that's not only
focused on employment,


1255
0:54:17,95 --> 0:54:21,1
but it's focus on the
intersection of various things


1256
0:54:21,1 --> 0:54:24,3
that the aid and development
community takes for granted.


1257
0:54:24,3 --> 0:54:26,13
So, I had an interesting
discussing with the Gates


1258
0:54:26,13 --> 0:54:30,47
Foundation last year about
maternal health and infant


1259
0:54:30,47 --> 0:54:31,62
mortality.


1260
0:54:31,62 --> 0:54:34,63
And of course, if you're
running a private philanthropic


1261
0:54:34,63 --> 0:54:37,21
organization, you have to
define what your field of action


1262
0:54:37,21 --> 0:54:39,76
is going to be, and if that's
your field of action, that's


1263
0:54:39,76 --> 0:54:41,2
where you're going to focus.


1264
0:54:41,2 --> 0:54:43,76
But the fact is if you come up
with effective maternal health


1265
0:54:43,76 --> 0:54:46,205
and infant mortality
programs now,


1266
0:54:46,205 --> 0:54:48,247
you better have an education
plan for five or six


1267
0:54:48,247 --> 0:54:50,288
years from now, and you
better have an employment


1268
0:54:50,288 --> 0:54:51,84
plan for 18 years
from now, or you're


1269
0:54:51,84 --> 0:54:54,53
going end up with what
happened to the Libyans


1270
0:54:54,53 --> 0:54:57,28
where the Libyans did a great
job in the '70s and '80s


1271
0:54:57,28 --> 0:55:0,16
improving public health,
which resulted in a youth


1272
0:55:0,16 --> 0:55:3,83
bulge, which resulted in a lot
of people hitting college age.


1273
0:55:3,83 --> 0:55:6,5
And the Libyan education
system was well


1274
0:55:6,5 --> 0:55:8,34
developed for making
people literate,


1275
0:55:8,34 --> 0:55:11,38
giving them skills in English,
and helping them become very


1276
0:55:11,38 --> 0:55:14,555
politically aware, but it was
really bad at generating people


1277
0:55:14,555 --> 0:55:17,59
that had skills that were
relevant to the Libyan economy,


1278
0:55:17,59 --> 0:55:19,38
which is basically oil and gas.


1279
0:55:19,38 --> 0:55:23,5
So you had this massive number
of expats doing those jobs,


1280
0:55:23,5 --> 0:55:25,35
and a lot of people coming
out of Libyan colleges


1281
0:55:25,35 --> 0:55:28,1
ended up working for
the civil service,


1282
0:55:28,1 --> 0:55:29,58
because basically
they just created


1283
0:55:29,58 --> 0:55:31,18
this giant public
service in order


1284
0:55:31,18 --> 0:55:33,769
to absorb all these people
that didn't have usable skills.


1285
0:55:33,769 --> 0:55:36,31
Then you had these government
departments that were basically


1286
0:55:36,31 --> 0:55:38,52
just jobs programs
and didn't exist


1287
0:55:38,52 --> 0:55:40,205
to provide any service
to the community,


1288
0:55:40,205 --> 0:55:42,58
so you had this breakdown of
trust between the government


1289
0:55:42,58 --> 0:55:46,12
and the population and
this giant underemployment


1290
0:55:46,12 --> 0:55:47,189
challenge.


1291
0:55:47,189 --> 0:55:48,98
And that was the
recruiting pool from which


1292
0:55:48,98 --> 0:55:53,34
people sprung in 2011 against
the regime when they began


1293
0:55:53,34 --> 0:55:56,9
seeing places like
Dubai and Kuwait


1294
0:55:56,9 --> 0:55:59,762
on the television, which they'd
never had access to until 2003.


1295
0:55:59,762 --> 0:56:1,22
And they're like,
hang on a second,


1296
0:56:1,22 --> 0:56:2,928
how come those guys
are living like that,


1297
0:56:2,928 --> 0:56:4,7
and we're living like this?


1298
0:56:4,7 --> 0:56:8,34
So I think that issue
is critically important,


1299
0:56:8,34 --> 0:56:11,88
figuring out the intersections
of all these different programs


1300
0:56:11,88 --> 0:56:13,382
and how they work together.


1301
0:56:13,382 --> 0:56:14,84
I think-- and this
is just my point


1302
0:56:14,84 --> 0:56:17,56
of view based on not
a huge amount of data,


1303
0:56:17,56 --> 0:56:20,11
but just based on observing
a lot of these cities--


1304
0:56:20,11 --> 0:56:22,1
there's a lot of
jobs out there that


1305
0:56:22,1 --> 0:56:25,76
are emerging through
self-synchronization


1306
0:56:25,76 --> 0:56:27,12
at the local level.


1307
0:56:27,12 --> 0:56:31,49
So if you want to go on
your Google mapping app,


1308
0:56:31,49 --> 0:56:36,54
and you live in Lagos, and
you want to check the traffic,


1309
0:56:36,54 --> 0:56:39,899
it's useless, because
it's red all the time.


1310
0:56:39,899 --> 0:56:41,44
Lagos seems to have
words for traffic


1311
0:56:41,44 --> 0:56:42,814
like Eskimos have
words for snow.


1312
0:56:42,814 --> 0:56:44,77
There's so many people there.


1313
0:56:44,77 --> 0:56:46,76
It's the infrastructure
of a medium


1314
0:56:46,76 --> 0:56:51,9
sized town with a population
the size of Australia basically.


1315
0:56:51,9 --> 0:56:53,89
And it's always red.


1316
0:56:53,89 --> 0:56:56,58
But, there are about 25
different local level radio


1317
0:56:56,58 --> 0:56:59,64
stations that only
broadcast for a few blocks


1318
0:56:59,64 --> 0:57:1,82
where people call in
and tell the radio


1319
0:57:1,82 --> 0:57:4,31
DJ what's going on
with traffic, and you


1320
0:57:4,31 --> 0:57:6,56
don't go on Google
to find out traffic.


1321
0:57:6,56 --> 0:57:8,897
You just change--
people have written up


1322
0:57:8,897 --> 0:57:11,48
on their window the frequencies
of these local radio stations,


1323
0:57:11,48 --> 0:57:14,63
and they just change from one
to another as they move through.


1324
0:57:14,63 --> 0:57:16,7
And they've basically
self-synchronized


1325
0:57:16,7 --> 0:57:19,44
their own traffic
information system


1326
0:57:19,44 --> 0:57:22,39
based on totally analog
means in that environment.


1327
0:57:22,39 --> 0:57:24,14
So there's a lot of
those kinds of things.


1328
0:57:24,14 --> 0:57:26,34
And there's also
a cognitive elite,


1329
0:57:26,34 --> 0:57:27,69
which is not the machine.


1330
0:57:27,69 --> 0:57:30,16
It's the marriage
of machine and human


1331
0:57:30,16 --> 0:57:31,73
that's actually
driving forward a lot


1332
0:57:31,73 --> 0:57:34,951
of the economic development
in places that we see.


1333
0:57:34,951 --> 0:57:36,7
I can talk about that
offline if you want,


1334
0:57:36,7 --> 0:57:38,68
because it's a whole
other discussion.


1335
0:57:38,68 --> 0:57:41,99
But then there's a lot of people
that are basically dispossessed


1336
0:57:41,99 --> 0:57:45,86
because of this change, and
what happens to those people


1337
0:57:45,86 --> 0:57:49,97
will drive a lot of what happens
in these environments I think.


1338
0:57:49,97 --> 0:57:49,93
AUDIENCE: Thank you.


1339
0:57:49,93 --> 0:57:51,887



1340
0:57:51,887 --> 0:57:53,22
MALE SPEAKER: Thanks for coming.


1341
0:57:53,22 --> 0:57:55,11
Let's have a warm hand
for David Kilcullen.


1342
0:57:55,11 --> 0:57:57,16
DAVID KILCULLEN: Hey,
thank you for having me.


1343
0:57:57,16 --> 0:59:57,16
