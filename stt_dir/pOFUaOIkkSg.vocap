###1 Belief in evolution is nothing more than a gut feeling, the National Center for
###5 Science Eradication supports teaching more bad science in the classroom, and
###9 of course, we read viewer feedback.  This is still one of the most talked about shows
###13 on youtube, this is Genesis Week.

###32 And a welcome to this episode of Genesis Week, the weekly program of creationary
###37 commentary on news, views and events pertaining to the origins controversy,
###41 exclusive right here on youtube.  Once again in the top ten most talked about
###46 videos in Science and Technology on youtube, we bring you the information the
###50 anti-creationists don't want you to see or hear, and we show the glory of God in the
###54 Creation. Don't get lost in cyberspace, just punch in

###69 A live science article carried the bold and revealing headline: "Belief in Evolution
###74 Boils Down to a Gut Feeling."  Now I must first make a disclaimer: The vast majority
###81 of people I have met who are of evolutionary persuasion, are good,
###85 honest people who simply have never heard any of the overwhelming evidence
###89 refuting evolution and affirming creation - after all, evolution has an army of judges,
###95 lawyers and school policies to hide behind and thus protect the masses from
###99 those inconvenient facts.  Thus the reason for this program, to educate people on
###105 what they haven't been told. Dealing with this subject regularly, I of
###109 course run into many people who religiously cling to evolution in spite of
###113 the facts, not because of them.  And so the live science article is an especially
###119 interesting read.
###121 The live Science team was reporting on an article by Minsu Ha, et al., in the
###126 Journal of Research in Science Teaching, available on line for free
###131 After waxing eloquently on how central and important evolution is to biology, the
###137 authors lament the fact that:
###150 In what has to be the ultimate irony, the authors never stop to ask questions like
###154 "Do these people who understand biology, perhaps have a good scientific
###159 reason to reject evolution?"  Ohhh, no, no, no, no, no! Instead, they go on to propose
###165 that people who accept or reject evolution do it based on... gut feelings.  The
###170 researchers never stop to consider their own psychological projection, that they
###175 themselves are believing evolution strictly because their gut tells them so, and not
###180 because of any scientific fact.
###183 I have some news for you folks:  There are numerous lines of scientific evidence
###187 which refute evolution, and in fact, the evidence from biology is some of the
###192 most powerful evidence refuting evolution, hence the reason many
###196 biologists reject evolution as the only explanation for life and its diversity.  You
###201 know, people like geneticists Dr. Kevin Anderson, Dr. Jean Lightner and Dr.
###207 Jonathan Sanford - co-inventor of the gene gun.  Or Dr. Jerry Bergman who
###211 holds nine degrees, two of them Phd's. The good scientific reasons from biology
###216 that refute evolution and instead point to a Creator are too many to list, but some
###221 examples are the origin of life, codependency of systems within life,
###225 genetic entropy, irreducible complexity, the lack of biological mechanisms to
###229 produce new, useful genetic information, etc., etc...
###233 Never considering even once that evolutionary theory could possibly have
###239 problems or - heaven forbid - be WRONG, the authors make an interesting
###244 comment:
###259 Translation: Meh. We don't have the facts to convince them, we just need to focus
###264 on putting on a convincing show.
###268 The National Center for Science Eradication has decided to take on global
###272 warming, now called "climate change" because global warming was so
###276 thoroughly refuted it's gotten a bad name. Comparing global warming to creationism,
###281 the NCSE has decided to take on this battle in the schools.  Basically, teachers
###286 in schools are feeling pressured to teach the controversy (in other words, teach the
###291 facts) of alleged "global warming," specifically the connection between
###296 human activity and global warming.  This is not difficult to discredit. We had an ice
###301 age, we are no longer in an  ice age, and the recession of the ice age had nothing
###307 to do with human activity.  One good volcano emits more "greenhouse gasses"
###312 than the entire industrial world does in a year. The correlation between sunspot
###317 activity and global temperatures is staggering, and let us not forget the huge
###321 methane beds buried in the continental shelves around the world, which contain
###326 waaaay more methane than all of the cow flatulations that McDonald's can produce.
###331 So it's to be expected that the NCSE would stand up for bankrupt "science"
###337 and help defend teachers against those who would like to see our children
###340 educated with actual facts instead of propaganda.
###344 It's interesting to note that the NCSE is a private organization, funded by private
###350 individuals with unknown motives and intentions. The NCSE has publically
###355 supported open, flagrant bigotry in academia towards anyone who dares
###360 question evolution, and has spearheaded most of the legal wranglings in a
###364 desperate attempt to protect evolution from scientific scrutiny in our education
###369 system.  This group has always targeted schools, and specifically aimed their guns
###374 at propagandizing your children.  Although they have "science" and "education" in
###380 their name, it's akin to the so-named "Planned parenthood" - an organization
###386 which has nothing to do with planning, or parenthood!
###388 It is clear that the NCSE's actions are anti-science, and anti-education.  Real
###394 scientists don't seek court protection and mandate for their theories to be taught in
###399 our schools, and real science welcomes scrutiny.  I welcome scrutiny in everything
###406 I say, because I'm not afraid of the truth and the facts.  Why does the NCSE so
###410 venomously fight scrutiny? Hmmmm?
###414 It's finally here, and the wait has been worth it.  For those of you who caught my
###420 good friend Spike Psarris's volume 1 of "What you aren't being told about
###423 astronomy", he has just released volume 2.  It was more of the fantastic
###428 drinking-from-the-firehose information, revealing God's astounding handiwork,
###432 showing why there has to be a Creator, and that the Creator of the Bible is the
###436 most likely culprit.  Many of those in the anti-creation community went into major
###440 "damage control mode" when Spike's first video came out - criticizing Spike
###446 personally on blogs and on youtube, while never addressing the scientific points he
###450 made, or worse - trying to respond to his points and making a bigger mess for the
###455 evolution of the solar system.  In his latest video, he takes on the origin of stars and
###460 galaxies. One of the many points he makes is showing how every secular
###464 theory on the origin of stars and galaxies....requires pre-existing stars.
###470 This video is only a few more nails in the coffin of the evolution of the astronomical
###475 bodies, and you can get your own copy from creationastronomy.com, for a
###480 measely fifteen bucks. I highly recommend the video, and am so looking
###483 forward to volume III.
###486 Homeschoolers: Carey Jane Clark has a homeschool blog and is now holding a
###490 "Think about it Thursday", starting   today, where she has a segment devoted to
###496 creation and homeschooling.  I'll be the guest writer on the blog, and we'll attempt
###501 to address common questions home schoolers may have.  Here's the link to her
###504 website.
###509 [scary, dramatic music]
###514 Wahoo! Mail for me?
###517 [scary, dramatic music]
###521 I was again impressed with the comments of CircusOfPrecision on youtube, who
###526 posted dozens of very enlightening comments - which were met by a barrage
###530 of willfully blind individuals.  Too many comments to repeat here, I'll simply
###534 encourage viewers to take a look, and I commend CircusOfPrecision - who
###539 apparently is not a young earth creationist.  I can only commend you for
###542 your diligence in educating those who do not want to be educated, and will simply
###547 remind you that you are being read by many others who are not commenting,
###552 but are paying close attention to how you have thoroughly and fearlessly decimated
###557 those who propone falsehoods.  Precision, for your valiant efforts in the intellectual
###562 battle - particularly against those who seem to have come to an intellectual
###566 battle unarmed, I salute you!  I'd buy you a Tim Horton's coffee, cause I'm sure your
###573 head must hurt after the barrage of non-sequitors and bad science that's
###577 been hurled at you.
###600 That was just such an excellent question Johnbgroovy - thank you for writing in.
###605 You are quite correct - an intelligent designer is a vague concept - we need to
###611 ask the question, if there is an intelligent designer, then who is that designer?  and
###618 how would you know?  Jesus claimed to be the Creator, but hey - I've had people
###623 tell me they were God.  Just because someone claims they're God doesn't
###627 mean they're God.  So when someone comes up to you and claims they're God -
###631 what's the first thing that comes out of your mouth?  I don't know about you, the
###635 first thing I said was "Oh ya? Prove it!" Let's prove Christ is God.  He proved it
###641 with so many miracles that even his enemies didn't deny them - including the
###646 miracle of rising from the dead.  Stalin didn't do this, nor did Buddha,
###650 nor did the flying spaghetti monster. Islamics even specifically state that
###655 Mohammed did not do any miracles, and I actually agree with them when they say
###659 they does not mean he was not a genuine prophet. After all, the Bible referred to
###664 John the Baptist as the greatest prophet ever, and yet he did no miracle.  Rather,
###669 the question here is, will the real and true Creator God please stand up? Jesus did
###675 countless miracles -but hey - Chris Angel does "miracles" all the time, perhaps
###681 Jesus was just a really good magician?  As a further sign that He was who He said He
###687 was, we have books written thousands of years before His arrival that made over
###691 400 specific prophecies about Christ - that were all fufilled in Christ.  God told
###699 the people of earth He was going to come to earth as a human, to redeem us.
###703 Basically He said "You will know it's me because I will do this, this, this, this,
###719 ........" He fulfilled those prophecies, including
###722 where he would be born, where He would die, HOW He would die, that none of His
###728 bones would be broken, that He would be betrayed by a friend, and for how many
###731 pieces of silver He would be betrayed. Finally, that He would rise again from the
###735 dead.  No one else has ever done this. That is how you know who the Creator is,
###742 and this Creator rose from the dead to show us He is the way, the TRUTH, and
###746 the LIFE.
###748 The Science Foundation said this:
###763 Oh yes - you're right, the coelacanth has changed in one way: its name.....which
###770 was assigned by evolutionists who want to make them out to be as different as
###773 possible.  We have more variation in dogs than we do in the fossil and living
###778 coelacanths.  So the only change that has happened, is in the name.  We see this in
###784 multiple cases, such as the herring. The fossil form is called Knightia, the modern,
###789 living version which is identical in every respect, is called Clupea.  The only
###794 evolutionary change evident, is in the name.
###798 Orge121 had a couple of interesting comments:
###811 Well, I didn't think NephilimFree was a ranting idiot, but thank you for writing,
###815 and you know what? I don't mind someone disagreeing with me, or saying
###820 I'm wrong.  After all, I am only human, I can make mistakes too, and I would like to
###824 be corrected if I am in error. You'll understand I typically ignore most replies
###829 as they aren't even worth paying attention to. They are simply assertions,
###832 accusations, insults and red herrings having nothing to do with whether or not
###836 I'm right.  So I appreciate your demeanor, thank you.  You also made a further,
###841 interesting comment worthy of a response:
###868 I agree with your fossilization statement - in fact, that was exactly my point: The
###874 absence of a fossil in a rock layer does not mean it was not present when the
###878 layer was formed.  In other words, not finding a fossil fish in, say, the Cambrian
###884 does not necessarily mean that fish was not there during the Cambrian.
###889 Consequently, you cannot build an evolutionary sequence based on any
###893 supposed order of fossils appearing in the rock record.  As for whales not
###897 hanging out in coastal areas, well, the entire whale watching industry is built
###901 upon coastal whale watching. When I went whale watching in Cape Breton, we
###905 were never more than about a mile and a half from the coast! In fact, I don't think it
###908 was even that far!  But thank you for writing in.
###953 Yes, I did say that.  Look at the gene pool: You had more variation in the bacterial
###958 gene pool before the exposure to the antibiotics, which wiped out a huge
###963 portion of the population, leaving behind bacteria - which already existed -
###968 but now with less variation in their genome. In other words, less information
###973 in their genomes - genetic information was wiped out - lost. This is reverse
###978 evolution.
###1001 Yes, that would be the famous "Lucy" skeleton.  If the evidence doesn't fit, make
###1006 it fit.  I covered this in Complete Creation, part 16.
###1046 Indeed!  If you haven't figured it out already, Teno is one of those people who
###1050 knows Joe Taylor personally. And yes, even though I have shown
###1054 numerous lines of scientific evidence that supports the paluxy tracks, lawilsom still
###1060 chooses to assert - with no evidence whatsoever - that they are all fakes.  Ya,
###1066 somebody carved human footprints underneath 18 inches of undisturbed
###1069 limestone. I'm one of the guys who has helped break up that rock to expose
###1074 tracks, in front of multiple eye witnesses, on more than one occassion - it's hard
###1079 work!  In fact, public excavations are held ever year in the Paluxy riverbed by the
###1086 Creation Evidence Museum - it's been going on for years.  There has literally
###1090 been hundreds of eye witnesses who will attest to the human footprints uncovered
###1094 there.
###1095 SwordOfTheSpiritUK immediately recognized the issue of human and
###1099 dinosaur footprints found together, and its relation to the age of the earth. While
###1103 he is an old-earth creationist, his comments and analysis has been very
###1107 interesting, and he's been documenting his intellectual journey on his blog.  He
###1113 certainly has not let me get away with anything, and has been a faithful skeptic.
###1117 I look forward to following his journey.
###1120 Well that's enough for this week - thanks to everyone who wrote in, agreeing or
###1123 disagreeing, and thanks for watching. Remember how easy it is to share this
###1127 program with your friends by clicking the convenient "share" button, down below.
###1131 I'm your host Ian Juby, signing off for now and reminding you that Jesus said I
###1135 am the way, the truth and the life - no man comes to the father but through me.
###1140 We'll see you next Thursday.
###1142 Production Software was provided for Genesis Week by the Big Valley Creation
###1146 Science Museum, located just 25 minutes north of Drumheller, Alberta. In the heart
###1151 of the dinosaur badlands, the Big Valley Creation Science Museum was built from
###1155 the ground up to give credit to our Creator, portraying the scientific evidence
###1159 showing that creation is the faith that fits the facts, and that evolution is the faith
###1164 that the facts have failed. Visit BVCSM.com for more details.
