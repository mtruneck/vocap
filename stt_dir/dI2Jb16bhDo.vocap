###62 there
###63 a real gone
###65 it's been called the most powerful going in the world
###69 super magnets accelerator projectile along twenty with allison to
###74 unimaginable speeds
###77 meaning of the house
###78 thousands and thousands of miles per hour
###80 with the projectile whereas a missile
###83 you're limited to hypersonic velocities it's a with three thousand miles per
###87 hour
###90 do you know maybe ten times faster kisi with modern technology
###94 the generals ordered unproven weapon bolted onto a truck bed
###100 as the rust into combat
###107 here
###117 but the expiry
###118 metallum weapons are no match for for a technology that crossed the cosmos
###133 and even if it isn't
###136 there is no time to mass produce new weapons five
###143 if our planet stands a chance
###146 the nations of growth must merge their competing military central one
###150 global army
###153 park humanity

###179 president reagan one state's beach where he said to the united nations macy's you
###184 may think about quickly our differences worldwide
###188 would finish if we were stationed in the a m trade
###192 from outside this work
###197 our former enemies now become our allies
###202 millions to sell it and i think
###204 with us on the cell something shoulder to shoulder with the taliban surviving
###208 allies
###210 interest darkest hour
###212 the nations of the world
###214 combine forces
###217 the warrior
###217 indeed of our entire species acts f
###227 but that's partly sunny
###229 for technology that can travel between the stars
###234 the defense organizations of the world
###236 their realized there
###238 multibillion dollar assets are not working
###246 their technology is so far superior to ours
###250 that hard
###250 don't last long
###254 now
###255 deletes focus their attacks
###262 fungus and some kind of a mission down to the era surface
###265 anything with madonna threat of admission because the next priority
###270 the lead air force clears the skies the
###276 then blasts military targets around the country
###284 successfully located military targets is simple
###289 began in the fall of sorrow radar signals
###295 generator system urinating a radar polls
###298 and that's something that we tracked
###300 if you're dealing with the civilization that's
###302 capable of space travel you may not want to call your attention
###306 and their weaponry down upon your like a reminder area you know that's one of us
###310 detection systems or data
###315 dvb-t craft seagull military installations around
###321 takeout
###322 offer made a comment units over all the government's armies of the world
###326 uh... that's gonna happen very quickly it may happen in in a matter of minutes
###329 might take a few days but it's gonna be very quick
###338 didn't want to attack the infrastructure of our society
###342 the backbone of human civilization itself
###345 become so simple
###347 undefended target
###349 they're gonna try to get things that we would use to resist right
###353 that's why we put the bright spots on the map to start taking them out
###356 we got our power
###357 have any power to do that
###361 and so it is all over this battlefield earth no
###366 military units obliterated
###369 cds ruined
###372 infrastructural emanated
###375 humanity
###376 defeated
###389 somewhere in the united states inside an underground bunker
###394 the leader of the fleetwood
###396 always his nation's options
###402 the plan to fight it gillian invasion includes one remaining possibility
###408 within devastatingly precautions
###411 somebody have to tell
###412 the president
###413 mr president we think the nuclear option you know one thing
###419 nuclear weapons
###421 the most powerful armaments ever conceived on this planet
###425 there are over twenty two thousand active nuclear warheads on earth
###430 the combined destruction could wipe out the entire human species
###435 twice over
###438 this may be the only effective option against the invaders
###443 credit cards entered terrifying cost
###449 who would killed millions of citizens inning campbell to destroy the enemy
###456 in america
###458 only the president has the authority to make that kind of decision
###464 but i think you'd be very
###465 remorse for regretful and it wouldn't undertake that decision lightly
###469 but at the end of the day i think you decide that that was the right thing to
###472 do
###476 the president called principally case
###479 the nuclear football
###482 the portable launch codes for america's arsenal
###490 the first started our nation's capital
###494 they've won ship is destroyed
###497 it may cause the others to retreat
###500 it's a demonstration of our destructive power
###503 and our resolve
###507 was a decision from eight minutes
###509 was the most effective way to use
###511 so uh... my first prev be dropped bombs on top of the vehicle
###515 so that they at least the the spacecraft with source you went below
###519 store up from fallout
###521 you would minimize the blast
###527 land-based nuclear missiles are already destroyed
###533 but there is another delivery system that may be on skates
###540 you don't know where the submarines are any given time
###543 and so uh... the submarine has the advantage that
###546 in theory at least the concert this fire ballistic missiles quickly submerge
###549 again
###551 disappear before the enemy as any
###553 ability to really responded back
###559 board
###560 somewhere in the atlantic ocean
###565 are suddenly rises from the depths
###569 one hundred fifty feet below the surface
###572 a patch opens
###575 i've tried and true ballistic missile
###577 bursts through this service
###578 and takes place
###584 it carries nearly three point lead megatons of destructive power
###589 two hundred fifty times the size of the perot shimla blast
###595 as its source toward its targets
###597 the missiles to detections
###601 breaks apart into the key warhead
###606 these warheads are self-guided and not dependent on satellites
###611 the nuclear warheads dark toward the alien vessel hanging over washington
###616 d_c_
###617 update of the planet riots unmanned spy
###621 destructive
###644 eight nuclear warheads
###647 power of true hundred fifty promotional bombs
###651 into with regard to the future
###653 puffery over our nation's capital
###667 it is the most destructive military attacking history
###673 four miles of ground zero flap
###678 we've been downtown d_c_
###680 ninety eight percent of the population
###686 but will it work
###697 earth's mightiest weapon has had no impact
###703 the recent is simple
###706 travel between the stars
###708 requires protection
###712 if they have the technology to get from their star system to hear they have to
###716 have a higher so metallurgy
###718 or they might have sealed like in science fiction
###722 if u but really really really fast spaceship
###726 and michael meteorite size of the desk that gives you
###729 at a park a lot of anything spacecraft
###731 this many times the largest nuclear weapon ever built by man cac
###735 so that they had shields
###736 they can withstand a nuclear weapon
###739 and how we're gonna do it may be scratch their fate but we destroyed all city in
###742 the process
###745 our nation's capital which is destroyed
###749 births armies are devastated
###753 but in the secret plans for t_v_ in indonesia the war isn't over
###759 descr the beginning
###764 from shielded bunkers in secret locations to survive in the military
###769 leaders issue orders for a surprising new tactic
###774 instead of attack
###776 the ordered their forces to do the opposite
###779 runaway
###783 very possible that the order because
###785 get out of the city's and disperse yourself as much as possible
###789 it's preferable to entirely from extinction extermination of human rights
###796 idealistic and i think the best you can
###799 do not present liable for gifts
###803 military should be afforded to disperse
###806 katie weapon take iraq take three days worth of food and
###811 winter where you can just go
###814 it's time to move on
###817 to fight another day
###849 firsts remaining committee
###850 cations hugs call for civilian evacuation
###854 everywhere
###858 colwell

###864 vacation earthquake
###868 the pacific tsunami
###872 in hurricane katrina
###874 combined
###876 in every city in the world
###879 the big differences
###882 will not com
