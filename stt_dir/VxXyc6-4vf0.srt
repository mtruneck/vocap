[INTRO MUSIC]


2
0:0:5,9 --> 0:0:7,92
INTERVIEWER: When did you
first realize you


3
0:0:7,92 --> 0:0:10,6
wanted to be an artist?


4
0:0:10,6 --> 0:0:13,35
DAN: I really wanted
to be in the NBA.


5
0:0:13,35 --> 0:0:15,2
That didn't work out.


6
0:0:15,2 --> 0:0:17,23
And then I skateboarded, and
I didn't really think about


7
0:0:17,23 --> 0:0:17,93
anything else.


8
0:0:17,93 --> 0:0:21,26
And then, just go to art school,
because you can't go


9
0:0:21,26 --> 0:0:22,79
anywhere else.


10
0:0:22,79 --> 0:0:26,27
And you just start taking it
seriously at some point.


11
0:0:26,27 --> 0:0:29,3
I didn't assume that I could
make a living off of it as


12
0:0:29,3 --> 0:0:30,47
quickly as I did.


13
0:0:30,47 --> 0:0:32,68
It's fortunate that I didn't
have to figure out


14
0:0:32,68 --> 0:0:33,64
something to do.


15
0:0:33,64 --> 0:0:35,46
I don't think I'm that
good of a painter, or


16
0:0:35,46 --> 0:0:35,98
anything like that.


17
0:0:35,98 --> 0:0:37,51
I just figure it out.


18
0:0:37,51 --> 0:0:38,6
It's not natural.


19
0:0:38,6 --> 0:0:40,54
It's all really formulated.


20
0:0:40,54 --> 0:0:43,1
Painting from a photograph,
you just study it.


21
0:0:43,1 --> 0:0:44,18
And you just figure out.


22
0:0:44,18 --> 0:0:48,96
If I just keep putting dots
down, really, really slowly,


23
0:0:48,96 --> 0:0:53,7
forever, it'll just work out.


24
0:0:53,7 --> 0:0:54,86
People really like my
candle paintings.


25
0:0:54,86 --> 0:0:56,23
That's what they really like.


26
0:0:56,23 --> 0:0:58,8
The last one I finished, it
took me a year to make.


27
0:0:58,8 --> 0:1:0,32
So they take a long time.


28
0:1:0,32 --> 0:1:1,68
I just found this image.


29
0:1:1,68 --> 0:1:4,55
I was looking though a Disney
book a long time ago.


30
0:1:4,55 --> 0:1:6,47
It's just a still
from Pinocchio.


31
0:1:6,47 --> 0:1:8,5
It's Geppetto's work table.


32
0:1:8,5 --> 0:1:10,31
The candle's just extinguishing
in all the


33
0:1:10,31 --> 0:1:12,55
paintings, and there's
smoke coming out it.


34
0:1:12,55 --> 0:1:13,44
And there are those
words up there.


35
0:1:13,44 --> 0:1:15,5
I don't pick them randomly,
but there's no


36
0:1:15,5 --> 0:1:18,86
theme to the text.


37
0:1:18,86 --> 0:1:23,59
One says, "fuck,." One said,
"so long." This one says


38
0:1:23,59 --> 0:1:24,63
"whatever."


39
0:1:24,63 --> 0:1:26,1
I made a "blow me" one.


40
0:1:26,1 --> 0:1:27,51
And I really liked it.


41
0:1:27,51 --> 0:1:30,71
And I must be a moron for it
not having occurred to me.


42
0:1:30,71 --> 0:1:34,53
But when somebody pointed out
the double entendre to it, I


43
0:1:34,53 --> 0:1:35,84
really started disliking it.


44
0:1:35,84 --> 0:1:36,68
But it was already gone.


45
0:1:36,68 --> 0:1:38,39
I don't really know
what it's about.


46
0:1:38,39 --> 0:1:40,31
But it's not that.


47
0:1:40,31 --> 0:1:41,315
INTERVIEWER: How many
of those candle


48
0:1:41,315 --> 0:1:43,6
paintings have you made?


49
0:1:43,6 --> 0:1:45,62
DAN: There is two hung
over there, that are


50
0:1:45,62 --> 0:1:46,36
being worked on.


51
0:1:46,36 --> 0:1:49,26
And I have one really tiny one
that I'm still working on.


52
0:1:49,26 --> 0:1:50,77
And that'll be 13, I think.


53
0:1:50,77 --> 0:1:55,54
I don't really know if 13 was
a number that has any


54
0:1:55,54 --> 0:1:56,16
relevance to me.


55
0:1:56,16 --> 0:2:0,37
But I just don't need to
work on them anymore.


56
0:2:0,37 --> 0:2:2,47
And I can't take it, also.


57
0:2:2,47 --> 0:2:5,132
It becomes really painful
painting the same one over and


58
0:2:5,132 --> 0:2:5,79
over again.


59
0:2:5,79 --> 0:2:7,37
And in terms of--


60
0:2:7,37 --> 0:2:11,9
I'm not even really working
on them that much anymore.


61
0:2:11,9 --> 0:2:13,47
I did the first lot of them.


62
0:2:13,47 --> 0:2:16,54
But hen you can just show
people how to do them.


63
0:2:16,54 --> 0:2:18,11
And you work on them
with them.


64
0:2:18,11 --> 0:2:21,86
And basically, what the
assistants enable me to do is


65
0:2:21,86 --> 0:2:23,59
that I can work on multiple
things at once.


66
0:2:23,59 --> 0:2:25,98
Maybe I'll fiddle with stuff
or think about stuff.


67
0:2:25,98 --> 0:2:28,49
Or, I don't know.


68
0:2:28,49 --> 0:2:29,15
And I stay here all night.


69
0:2:29,15 --> 0:2:30,73
And I go home in the morning,
and I come back.


70
0:2:30,73 --> 0:2:33,95
I mean I'm in here everyday,
messing around with


71
0:2:33,95 --> 0:2:35,75
something or other.


72
0:2:35,75 --> 0:2:39,804
The bird shit, the kiss, and the
gum all kind of come from


73
0:2:39,804 --> 0:2:40,788
the same place.


74
0:2:40,788 --> 0:2:44,724
I just started trying to pursue
other ideas of making


75
0:2:44,724 --> 0:2:46,692
paintings or using a canvas.


76
0:2:46,692 --> 0:2:48,91
INTERVIEWER: It's
real gum, right?


77
0:2:48,91 --> 0:2:50,594
DAN: It's all real gum.


78
0:2:50,594 --> 0:2:56,23
This is just moving them from
one canvas to another.


79
0:2:56,23 --> 0:2:57,6
I'm just messing around.


80
0:2:57,6 --> 0:2:59,33
I don't really touch
them at all.


81
0:2:59,33 --> 0:3:1,35
I just like them to look
as random as possible.


82
0:3:1,35 --> 0:3:6,3
So I just have them transfer
them between canvases.


83
0:3:6,3 --> 0:3:7,445
I try to get them to
do it really quick.


84
0:3:7,445 --> 0:3:10,38
And then I come over
and finesse it


85
0:3:10,38 --> 0:3:11,27
a little bit, maybe.


86
0:3:11,27 --> 0:3:13,172
It's pretty idiotic.


87
0:3:13,172 --> 0:3:16,335
You want me to try to talk about
why I make them, and--


88
0:3:16,335 --> 0:3:17,75
INTERVIEWER: Yeah, absolutely.


89
0:3:17,75 --> 0:3:19,678
Yeah.


90
0:3:19,678 --> 0:3:21,124
DAN: I don't really have
[INAUDIBLE] like that.


91
0:3:21,124 --> 0:3:24,52
But on the rocks, the rocks were
about, they looked like


92
0:3:24,52 --> 0:3:28,11
these things that you come up to
walking through the woods.


93
0:3:28,11 --> 0:3:30,13
And teenagers would set
up camp around there.


94
0:3:30,13 --> 0:3:30,68
And drink beer.


95
0:3:30,68 --> 0:3:32,18
And so there's spray paint
all over them.


96
0:3:32,18 --> 0:3:35,51
And people stick gum
on rocks and trees.


97
0:3:35,51 --> 0:3:38,362
So that's were it came from,
from rocks and trees, or


98
0:3:38,362 --> 0:3:41,53
underneath desks, all
that kind of stuff.


99
0:3:41,53 --> 0:3:43,6
INTERVIEWER: Can I stick
my gum to this one now?


100
0:3:43,6 --> 0:3:44,54
DAN: Yeah, go for it.


101
0:3:44,54 --> 0:3:45,3
INTERVIEWER: All
right, awesome.


102
0:3:45,3 --> 0:3:46,6
Anywhere?


103
0:3:46,6 --> 0:3:47,31
DAN: Anywhere you want.


104
0:3:47,31 --> 0:3:50,74



105
0:3:50,74 --> 0:3:52,344
INTERVIEWER: Cool.


106
0:3:52,344 --> 0:3:53,3
Thanks.


107
0:3:53,3 --> 0:3:55,36
DAN: Thank you.


108
0:3:55,36 --> 0:3:57,0
INTERVIEWER: How do you
go about making this?


109
0:3:57,0 --> 0:4:1,21
Do you look at a lot of bird
shit photos, or something?


110
0:4:1,21 --> 0:4:2,46
DAN: I actually would
walk around Chelsea,


111
0:4:2,46 --> 0:4:4,42
underneath the High Line.


112
0:4:4,42 --> 0:4:7,14
Because you know all the birds
hang out over there.


113
0:4:7,14 --> 0:4:9,15
And take lots of pictures.


114
0:4:9,15 --> 0:4:12,46
I've made a lot of them,
like 150 maybe.


115
0:4:12,46 --> 0:4:13,65
Some look really real.


116
0:4:13,65 --> 0:4:18,19
Some remind people of these kind
of paintings, and others,


117
0:4:18,19 --> 0:4:19,455
abstract paintings.


118
0:4:19,455 --> 0:4:21,86
You learn new techniques, but
you're just throwing paint at


119
0:4:21,86 --> 0:4:23,14
the canvas, basically.


120
0:4:23,14 --> 0:4:25,18
INTERVIEWER: So this kiss
one, is this one


121
0:4:25,18 --> 0:4:27,18
person, or many people?


122
0:4:27,18 --> 0:4:28,524
DAN: This is one person.


123
0:4:28,524 --> 0:4:30,702
I thought they had
really close to a


124
0:4:30,702 --> 0:4:34,14
perfect set of lips.


125
0:4:34,14 --> 0:4:35,31
INTERVIEWER: That must have
taken them forever.


126
0:4:35,31 --> 0:4:36,93
DAN: Took her a long time.


127
0:4:36,93 --> 0:4:37,8
INTERVIEWER: And
it's lipstick?


128
0:4:37,8 --> 0:4:39,99
A lot of lipstick?


129
0:4:39,99 --> 0:4:41,66
DAN: Yeah, it's all lipstick.


130
0:4:41,66 --> 0:4:42,25
INTERVIEWER: How many tubes?


131
0:4:42,25 --> 0:4:42,8
DAN: She wears a little
wrestling


132
0:4:42,8 --> 0:4:45,5
mask so that she doesn't--


133
0:4:45,5 --> 0:4:48,734
she was getting these horrible
rashes on her nose and chins.


134
0:4:48,734 --> 0:4:50,844
But after she did this she said
she would never ever do


135
0:4:50,844 --> 0:4:52,63
it again, which is too bad,
because I really, really like


136
0:4:52,63 --> 0:4:54,91
this painting a lot.


137
0:4:54,91 --> 0:4:56,39
I think this is really pretty.


138
0:4:56,39 --> 0:4:59,935
And I feel like I never really
make straightforwardly stuff


139
0:4:59,935 --> 0:5:1,41
that [INAUDIBLE] beautiful.


140
0:5:1,41 --> 0:5:5,933
But it still has enough dirty
implications to satisfy that


141
0:5:5,933 --> 0:5:9,17
side of me.


142
0:5:9,17 --> 0:5:10,73
This is a Jewish prayer shawl.


143
0:5:10,73 --> 0:5:14,13
It's called a tallit, and it's
hanging off a boner.


144
0:5:14,13 --> 0:5:15,35
It just came to me, randomly.


145
0:5:15,35 --> 0:5:16,6
Not through--


146
0:5:16,6 --> 0:5:19,97



147
0:5:19,97 --> 0:5:22,79
it's pretty easy for somebody
to think lots of different


148
0:5:22,79 --> 0:5:23,45
thoughts about it.


149
0:5:23,45 --> 0:5:25,23
But I didn't have one
particular one.


150
0:5:25,23 --> 0:5:26,87
INTERVIEWER: Well, you're
Jewish, right?


151
0:5:26,87 --> 0:5:27,54
DAN: I'm Jewish, yeah.


152
0:5:27,54 --> 0:5:29,99
INTERVIEWER: Did you get
any feedback to it?


153
0:5:29,99 --> 0:5:34,695
DAN: People in Berlin
reacted to it.


154
0:5:34,695 --> 0:5:36,11
And they were all ripped
down really quick.


155
0:5:36,11 --> 0:5:40,6
But you don't know if it's
Jews ripping it down, or


156
0:5:40,6 --> 0:5:42,67
neo-Nazis ripping it down.


157
0:5:42,67 --> 0:5:44,22
I couldn't say.


158
0:5:44,22 --> 0:5:46,95
Nobody's said anything in
depth to me about it.


159
0:5:46,95 --> 0:5:49,5
Some people think it's silly.


160
0:5:49,5 --> 0:5:51,94
And some people think
it's funny.


161
0:5:51,94 --> 0:5:54,56
I don't know.


162
0:5:54,56 --> 0:5:57,252
INTERVIEWER: I see another
Jewish biblical theme.


163
0:5:57,252 --> 0:5:59,0
DAN: Yeah.


164
0:5:59,0 --> 0:6:0,61
I am who I am.


165
0:6:0,61 --> 0:6:2,27
But I still like--


166
0:6:2,27 --> 0:6:4,22
there's something really
straightforward about it where


167
0:6:4,22 --> 0:6:6,26
it's like, you know,
a bunch of animals


168
0:6:6,26 --> 0:6:7,37
bummed on Noah's ark.


169
0:6:7,37 --> 0:6:12,17
But beyond that, I don't
have anything I can


170
0:6:12,17 --> 0:6:13,84
really say about it.


171
0:6:13,84 --> 0:6:16,31
But there's tons of
religious things.


172
0:6:16,31 --> 0:6:18,95
Even with like something
like the candle.


173
0:6:18,95 --> 0:6:22,38
When I first saw the image,
I'm thinking something


174
0:6:22,38 --> 0:6:25,0
God-like about that.


175
0:6:25,0 --> 0:6:26,68
This is actually just
a giant Constable


176
0:6:26,68 --> 0:6:27,77
painting that I copied.


177
0:6:27,77 --> 0:6:30,16
And I put in all the
signs and stuff.


178
0:6:30,16 --> 0:6:33,6
I'm not a spiritual person,
necessarily, but I think about


179
0:6:33,6 --> 0:6:35,1
stuff like that sometimes.


180
0:6:35,1 --> 0:6:38,23
So it will come up in my work.


181
0:6:38,23 --> 0:6:40,7
There are millions of people
running around the world


182
0:6:40,7 --> 0:6:41,89
talking about some God.


183
0:6:41,89 --> 0:6:45,89
I'm curious about where he
is, and stuff like that.


184
0:6:45,89 --> 0:6:47,89
I'd like to find him.


185
0:6:47,89 --> 0:6:49,26
INTERVIEWER: What do you think
about the art world?


186
0:6:49,26 --> 0:6:51,21
Do you like the art world?


187
0:6:51,21 --> 0:6:52,35
DAN: I'm collected seriously.


188
0:6:52,35 --> 0:6:55,125
I'm in really big, important
shows, especially


189
0:6:55,125 --> 0:6:56,67
for somebody my age.


190
0:6:56,67 --> 0:6:59,38
I work a lot, so I
produce a lot.


191
0:6:59,38 --> 0:7:0,87
And people seem to
like it, too.


192
0:7:0,87 --> 0:7:6,61
But I feel like writers and
people like that would rather


193
0:7:6,61 --> 0:7:8,12
like not take me seriously.


194
0:7:8,12 --> 0:7:10,7
But I don't know exactly why.


195
0:7:10,7 --> 0:7:14,6
And, yeah, you could speculate
something about--


196
0:7:14,6 --> 0:7:20,2
because my lifestyle is fun, or
stupid, or whatever, that


197
0:7:20,2 --> 0:7:23,4
they think that I don't take
my work seriously.


198
0:7:23,4 --> 0:7:29,28
Or maybe they're just
unhappy themselves.


199
0:7:29,28 --> 0:7:30,27
Whatever.


200
0:7:30,27 --> 0:7:31,4
There's things about the
art world that I


201
0:7:31,4 --> 0:7:32,41
don't really like.


202
0:7:32,41 --> 0:7:35,7
There's lots of stupid shit with
market, or collectors, or


203
0:7:35,7 --> 0:7:37,31
curators, or bullshit
like that.


204
0:7:37,31 --> 0:7:42,98
But I try not to think about
it, and just make my work.


205
0:7:42,98 --> 0:7:46,36
I don't see a point in
constantly bashing it or being


206
0:7:46,36 --> 0:7:47,42
bummed out on it.


207
0:7:47,42 --> 0:7:49,95
Because I'd be depressed
all the time.


208
0:7:49,95 --> 0:7:52,91
So I just pay attention
and make my work.


209
0:7:52,91 --> 0:7:55,4
And sometimes I'll go to
a party where I have


210
0:7:55,4 --> 0:7:57,62
to deal with them.


211
0:7:57,62 --> 0:7:59,54
And I find a way to have fun.


212
0:7:59,54 --> 0:8:2,15
I think that if I was walking
around bummed about the art


213
0:8:2,15 --> 0:8:5,8
world all time, I wouldn't be
able to be a part of it.


214
0:8:5,8 --> 0:10:5,8
