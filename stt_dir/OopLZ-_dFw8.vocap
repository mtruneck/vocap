###0 wilcox county high school in georgia has not hack and racially integrated com
###7 unbelievable added
###8 says twenty lectures with a wet places like the executive branch there has to
###13 different problems they have a white prague event so-called into racially
###17 integrated probable suites where you know the black students have their prom
###21 right in the cool like it to go
###24 drown me at some something clan
###27 and now what's happening right now is our forces that are fighting there
###30 they're trying to raising money
###33 to have a racially integrated trial because what the high school does is
###35 they don't have their own probably have
###38 private parties
###39 provide for a prom okay
###41 so hot
###42 parents add maybe some members of staff knows they provide funding for you know
###48 white prom and then the other prom on it since they're privately funded the
###52 school really doesn't have much say in terms of what happened switched back i
###55 think is the as if it's a prom that's tied to your students you should not
###59 allow any any type of segregation it of course and so
###64 the other problem obvious is not really racially integrated because they're
###67 having to raise money for a whole different
###69 racially integrated products another headed have three props
###73 if your wife there you go to all three of us kind of cool
###76 kid dependent now seriously getting him and
###79 i'm and literally have trouble reading the story okay so there's a lot of news
###83 of our i want to show that see you guys to and because it'll give you some more
###87 detail than
###88 how it works and what happened to one o'clock sitemap dot that's the issue
###92 left to the white from looks at their world full-color wilcox county has
###95 caused those people who says black and white
###98 there the white prominent had a annotated prompted n erased other than
###102 cartesian tries to and the white brown
###105 they would probably have a policeman and well-prepared
###109 that was the case just last year as a biracial student was turned away by
###113 police it's been away for as long as anyone can remember it doesn't stop it
###117 from
###118 homecoming is almost everyday
###121 and the homecoming king queen
###123 one the one was more than one this year for the first time in and out of black
###127 and a black man away what
###129 it was a black and white and black
###132 and they were uh... they were allowed to pictures two for the year but
###136 harmonica
###138 so that when people say race in this guy
###142 now look have we made progress
###144 of course we have this is an would have described entire herself
###147 you know forty fifty years ago
###151 that goes to show it wasn't that long ago that
###154 because we still have remnants of it
###156 in twenty thirteen this storm playing this
###159 the fact of the activities in that town have put up with it
###163 you know is amazing i mean obviously not want to know that we could escorted out
###167 of the dalai
###168 but cars
###169 but if ever there was a time to call and then double a_c_p_ et cetera this is a
###173 that they have a little story keep the black kids from goldman were probably
###177 just go to the white promptly ended this year
###181 but you did you get the police com the political complicated story allow what
###185 charge
###186 and by the way of thinking about whether black people in that time to get a fair
###190 shake
###190 on other matters act let alone when it comes to the police those police are
###194 escorting a black is for the prompt even imagine they turn around and say
###198 although no i'm not gonna pull the plug of respondents
###202 or do you think they make certain assumptions about coordinated since
###205 as a candidate the regular fare sort of it's formats of the school this is a
###209 well into the while the school is no official stance on that
###212 does the have travis and definitely do have an official stance have to have one
###218 uh... but another point that i wanted to make
###221 the fact that you don't we talk about
###223 institutional racism and we talk about certain uh... obstacles that a black
###228 people have to go through just to become successful and one thing that we
###232 unfortunately get the chance to talk about earlier this week was a study that
###236 was done on uh... networking and how lot of times
###240 people who are c_e_o_'s are managers are owners of companies
###243 uh... art typically white and when we do they do favors for their boyfriends and
###248 those are the people that usually get hired into their companies so bill
###251 redeker position with
###253 uh... robert johnson who said who was that had it bt
###256 than i thought was a really
###258 interesting
###259 but rogers amends process from a conservative
###262 but i thought his answer served or other words replicating said any mentioned
###266 just that point it it's not
###268 even malicious nine if you are exactly you know if you're a regular guy your
###271 carpenter were you when i'm here
###273 and for that one of the job opens up the you know
###277 carpenter position
###278 your son your nephew jesus you know
###281 that would help okay although he kinda left i know
###284 say i'm not sure is a great carbon
###286 may be happy to know
###289 and so that's just the way it works here in a union
###291 and so one of the reasons you need affirmative action was to break through
###294 that national barrier
###296 that was a demon s early malicious
###298 okay now this in georgia is malicious prepared by the way law that either
###304 watched
###305 yet over the course of course pack a day
###307 but even now i'm just saying that right here is that you know i'll give you know
###310 the we work with your friends yet and if you have no exposed anybody else's gonna
###314 keep perpetuating the situation
###317 and it's amazing to in another
###319 blaming the victim he don't get me wrong but
###322 summation among people problems
###324 i know that it was incredible part of the story and this has been going on for
###327 decades
###328 there'll they're like uh... talent frozen in time
###332 innocent civilians are spread this story and it has a proposal earlier this week
###336 when i first read i think this is an april fool's joke sorry there's no
###339 question about it
###340 but now it's a real this is the kind of suffered some having a country
###343 suffolk ip alike
###345 ignored it lacked and then just pretend like we don't have any problems of
###348 racism
