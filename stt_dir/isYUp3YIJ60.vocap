###4 TED SOUTHERN: A space suit is an enclosure to protect a
###8 human being from the extreme environments of space.
###12 The classic way of talking about an EVA suit is a
###15 spaceship for one.
###19 So how is it possible for two guys to make space suits that
###23 historically have been built by whole teams of people?
###27 How is it possible?
###28 Maybe we shouldn't be doing this.
###29 
###51 My name is Ted Southern.
###52 We are here at the Final Frontier Design studio.
###56 
###92 NIK MOISEEV: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###93 
###170 TED SOUTHERN: I moved to New York and told people I wanted
###173 to make body armor for a living, and that was really my
###175 goal in life.
###177 And I was lucky, within about a year of living here, to find
###180 a costume shop, Izquierdo Studios in Chelsea, that
###185 actually did make body armor.
###186 And 10 years at Izquierdo Studio taught me a lot of
###189 different things about a lot of different materials.
###192 I still do costuming now independently.
###196 I got started making wings for Victoria's Secret, and I'm
###198 still doing that now.
###200 
###205 I actually see a lot of commonality between costuming
###209 and space suits.
###210 You're obviously building for the human body.
###212 You want something to be comfortable and functional.
###214 I suppose, on paper, I would be the creative one coming up
###217 with crazy ideas and Nik would keep me in line.
###220 But sometimes it's the other way around.
###222 With space suits, it's a longer process.
###226 There's generally a little bit more money involved, a little
###228 bit higher technology.
###230 But I really see it as a continuum, and there's a great
###233 deal of relation.
###235 And Nik and I were competitors in the 2007 Astronaut Glove
###240 Competition, which is part of NASA's Centennial Challenges,
###243 sort of like the X PRIZES.
###245 The challenge was to redesign a space suit glove to have
###249 lower torque and higher mobility than NASA's current
###251 technology.
###253 
###256 With the glove, it's been a consistent problem.
###258 It's sort of the weak point of design for a space suit.
###261 It is the most functional part of the suit, and a critical
###264 part of astronaut efficiency.
###267 Neither one of us won in 2007.
###270 And I gave you a ride back to New York
###273 City afterwards, right?
###274 NIK MOISEEV: Right.
###276 TED SOUTHERN: And kind of never thought I
###277 would see him again.
###279 But he kept in touch through email, and we decided to
###283 become partners for the 2009 Astronaut Glove Competition.
###288 And we outperformed NASA's current technology and won
###291 some money.
###292 We won second place and formed an LLC from there.
###297 So here at Final Frontier Design, we are working
###300 specifically on IVA suits now.
###302 We're trying to meet a market demand in the new commercial
###306 space industry for launch and reentry suits.
###308 
###324 TED SOUTHERN: This is a vacuum chamber glove box.
###327 It pulls pressure out from inside this chamber and mimics
###330 that pressure differential you would have inside a suit.
###334 The gloves are obviously really important to test on
###336 their own as much as possible, because it really is the human
###341 interaction with space.
###342 It's how humans get work done, is with their hands.
###345 But we can go in here and try different tests for dexterity.
###350 One of the ones that I think is particularly
###352 hard is this peg board.
###354 Last time I was at the Johnson Space Center, we used their
###358 vacuum chamber glove box, and inside they
###360 had a Rubik's cube.
###362 So I felt like I needed a Rubik's cube in my vacuum
###365 chamber as well.
###367 So this is what we call the Frontier Prime, it's our first
###371 full-body pressure garment.
###373 This suit was a collaboration between the two of us, Nikolay
###376 built the outer garment.
###378 So this is what we call the 2G suit, the
###380 second generation suit.
###381 The real advantage of this suit is it's almost entirely
###385 single layer.
###386 
###390 So it is a challenge for two guys to be making space suits
###393 when historically it's been the
###394 dominion of crews of engineers.
###397 
###403 But we've made a lot of accomplishments so far.
###406 Obviously, we started with gloves, which are one of the
###409 most specific and heavy-designed parts of a
###412 space suit.
###413 And we've made a great deal of improvements over the years in
###417 not just our gloves, but obviously we've moved on to a
###420 whole suit.
###420 We're testing at levels that NASA tests at, as far as
###424 leakage rates, as far as range of motion, as far as cycling,
###426 as far as torque.
###428 
###430 
###453 TED SOUTHERN: It's low weight.
###454 It's low mass, which is a huge driver in space travel.
###459 There are generally considered to be two
###461 kinds of space suits.
###462 One is an IVA suit, which is sort of a launch, reentry, and
###466 docking suit.
###467 IVA is Intra-Vehicular Activity.
###469 
###472 The EVA suits, Extra-Vehicular Activity, are a lot more
###476 complicated.
###476 They have life support generally on their back.
###480 They have enclosures over the pressure garment that protect
###483 from thermal extremes,
###485 micrometeoroids, sometimes radiation.
###488 Even before Americans were going to space, they were
###491 going to very high altitudes where they needed protection
###494 from the extreme environment.
###496 And I think the most classic case of-- the pioneer of that
###500 is Wiley Post.
###503 He's an early aviator who did a lot of experience with
###507 pressure garments.
###507 He had a distinct advantage because he only had one eye,
###510 so he could turn the visor of his helmet to one side and get
###514 good peripheral vision.
###516 He used pretty crude and rudimentary things-- squirrel
###519 fur and really thick rubber and very restricted mobility--
###524 and was very dependent on the capsule that he was in.
###529 NIK MOISEEV: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###531 
###557 TED SOUTHERN: Obviously, with NASA, space suits improved
###560 quite a bit.
###561 The Mercury suits were much more anthropomorphic and
###565 functional, but we didn't see EVA until Gemini.
###570 The Apollo suits that went to the Moon were even a great
###574 deal more functional than the Gemini suits who only saw
###577 limited EVA.
###579 -I like to skip along.
###581 -Not me, boy.
###582 Skip.
###582 -Well, whatever you call it.
###584 
###587 NIK MOISEEV: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###588 
###607 TED SOUTHERN: Today's current EMU has a really
###610 long lifespan on orbit.
###612 It's capable of 8 to 10 hour EVAs, through a great variety
###617 of sizes of people.
###618 There are females and males who are doing work
###621 in space suits now.
###622 So it's come a long way since Wiley Post for sure.
###627 -Wave for the camera.
###629 That's good.
###631 All right.
###631 NIK MOISEEV: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###633 
###642 TED SOUTHERN: So I'm pretty excited about the waist belt.
###644 We really need to work on that.
###646 NIK MOISEEV: I am so hungry that--
###648 TED SOUTHERN: Are you hungry?
###649 But we just ate.
###650 So in June of this year, June of 2012, we launched a
###654 Kickstarter campaign to help us support our new company,
###659 and to really sort of announce that we're ready to build a
###663 flight-certified suit.
###665 So thank you for your Kickstarter support.
###668 All right.
###668 NIK MOISEEV: Give me five.
###671 TED SOUTHERN: We were successful.
###672 We reached our funding goals.
###674 But I think more importantly than that, we got customers.
###677 We got press.
###678 We got people aware of our project.
###681 We are working now with Zero2Infinity, which is, as I
###684 mentioned, the Spanish high-altitude balloon company.
###687 I think it'll give a lot of validation to work at altitude
###691 and to test these suits in flight before they start going
###694 on rockets.
###696 So we're really excited be working with them.
###698 
###712 It's exciting for us to be around in this time where the
###716 commercial industry is just starting to exist.
###720 I think there's a lot of very optimistic people saying next
###724 year we'll fly.
###726 It's a long wait, but I think it's really exciting that it's
###729 actually happening.
###730 And I think once the industry gains a little bit of
###732 traction, it will really expand quite quickly.
###735 
###745 It's part of human destiny to move beyond Earth.
###749 It may take a long time, but I think that
###752 it's part of our future.
###753 There's a great William Burroughs quote where he says
###755 human beings are not destined to remain human beings any
###760 more than a tadpole is destined to remain a tadpole.
###764 We will evolve.
###766 We will move on past Earth.
