1
0:0:23,0 --> 0:0:25,0
You're a jerk, Thom.


2
0:0:25,0 --> 0:0:27,0
Look Celia, we have to follow our passions;


3
0:0:27,0 --> 0:0:30,8
...you have your robotics, and I
just want to be awesome in space.


4
0:0:30,8 --> 0:0:34,5
Why don't you just admit that
you're freaked out by my robot hand?


5
0:0:34,5 --> 0:0:37,0
I'm not freaked out by- it's...


6
0:0:37,0 --> 0:0:38,0
...alright! Fine!


7
0:0:38,0 --> 0:0:41,0
I'm freaked out! I have nightmares
that I'm being chased...


8
0:0:41,0 --> 0:0:43,0
...by these giant robotic claws of death...


9
0:0:43,0 --> 0:0:50,0
Whatever, Thom. We're done.


10
0:0:50,0 --> 0:1:1,0
Robot's memory synced and locked!


11
0:1:1,0 --> 0:1:57,0
This is pretty freaky.


12
0:1:57,0 --> 0:2:11,0
Shouldn't you be down there?


13
0:2:11,0 --> 0:2:16,0
I heard you guys talking last night.


14
0:2:16,0 --> 0:3:11,0
It's not my fault, you know.


15
0:3:11,0 --> 0:3:13,0
Are you ready?


16
0:3:13,0 --> 0:3:17,0
Of course you're ready, you're a rockstar.


17
0:3:17,0 --> 0:3:19,0
How's it looking, Barley?


18
0:3:19,0 --> 0:3:21,5
We should have about ten minutes...


19
0:3:21,5 --> 0:3:23,5
Well that's perfect.


20
0:3:23,5 --> 0:3:28,0
We're on in one! All systems go!
Yeah you, go! 


21
0:3:28,0 --> 0:3:33,0
Go! Move your asses! Go go go! 


22
0:3:33,0 --> 0:3:43,0
I love it! Come on, go!


23
0:3:43,0 --> 0:3:44,5
That's nice. 


24
0:3:44,5 --> 0:3:46,0
Nothing to worry about.


25
0:3:46,0 --> 0:3:51,0
Thom.


26
0:3:51,0 --> 0:3:53,5
There she is.


27
0:3:53,5 --> 0:3:55,0
Now.


28
0:3:55,0 --> 0:3:57,0
You love her.


29
0:3:57,0 --> 0:4:0,0
She is your passion! 


30
0:4:0,0 --> 0:4:1,5
Be tender to her. 


31
0:4:1,5 --> 0:4:5,0
Be honest! Eh- be tender.


32
0:4:5,0 --> 0:4:52,0
Remind her what love is.


33
0:4:52,0 --> 0:4:56,5
...and, action!


34
0:4:56,5 --> 0:4:59,0
Memory overwrite in progress!


35
0:4:59,0 --> 0:5:2,5
You're a jerk, Thom!


36
0:5:2,5 --> 0:5:16,0
Ohp- Sorry! Sorry.


37
0:5:16,0 --> 0:5:18,0
Look Celia.


38
0:5:18,0 --> 0:5:21,0
We have to follow our passions. 


39
0:5:21,0 --> 0:5:25,0
You have your robotics...


40
0:5:25,0 --> 0:5:39,0
...and I just want to be awesome in space.


41
0:5:39,0 --> 0:5:43,0
Okay, they're coming. Two minutes left!


42
0:5:43,0 --> 0:5:45,0
Speed it up, Thom! 


43
0:5:45,0 --> 0:5:47,0
Vivacissimo!


44
0:5:47,0 --> 0:5:56,0
Why don't you just admit that you're 
freaked out by my robot hand?


45
0:5:56,0 --> 0:5:59,5
Listen Celia, I was young...


46
0:5:59,5 --> 0:6:1,0
...and a dick. 


47
0:6:1,0 --> 0:6:5,0
But that's no reason to
destroy the world.


48
0:6:5,0 --> 0:6:6,5
Why does he do this?


49
0:6:6,5 --> 0:6:11,5
We already tried that one!


50
0:6:11,5 --> 0:6:13,0
Abort!


51
0:6:13,0 --> 0:6:14,0
Cut!


52
0:6:14,0 --> 0:6:19,0
Whoaaa!


53
0:6:19,0 --> 0:6:21,0
Whoaaa!


54
0:6:21,0 --> 0:6:23,0
Nooooo!


55
0:6:23,0 --> 0:6:26,0
You broke my heart.


56
0:6:26,0 --> 0:6:27,0
I know.


57
0:6:27,0 --> 0:6:29,0
You forgot me on earth.


58
0:6:29,0 --> 0:6:30,5
I know.


59
0:6:30,5 --> 0:6:36,0
I should just crush you.


60
0:6:36,0 --> 0:6:47,0
I'm-


61
0:6:47,0 --> 0:6:50,0
I'm sorry.


62
0:6:50,0 --> 0:6:59,0
Good ad-lib.


63
0:6:59,0 --> 0:7:2,0
Not my fault!


64
0:7:2,0 --> 0:7:8,0
This time.


65
0:7:8,0 --> 0:7:10,0
Quiet on set!


66
0:7:10,0 --> 0:8:13,0
We're out of time!


67
0:8:13,0 --> 0:8:22,0
Come on!


68
0:8:22,0 --> 0:8:24,0
RAAAAAAAAH!


69
0:8:24,0 --> 0:8:26,0
Memory overwrite, 90%.


70
0:8:26,0 --> 0:8:38,0
Captain! We have to abort!


71
0:8:38,0 --> 0:8:54,0
The world's changed, Celia...


72
0:8:54,0 --> 0:8:58,0
...maybe we can too.


73
0:8:58,0 --> 0:9:19,0
Memory overwrite complete!


74
0:9:19,0 --> 0:9:22,0
You know.


75
0:9:22,0 --> 0:9:26,0
There's a lesson to be learned from this.


76
0:9:26,0 --> 0:11:26,0
Could'a gone worse.
