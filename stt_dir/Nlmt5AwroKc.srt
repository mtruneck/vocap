1
0:0:0,1 --> 0:0:3,35
But 12.000 years ago the great ice sheets retreated


2
0:0:3,35 --> 0:0:6,83
and Iceland was liberated from their wintery grip,


3
0:0:6,83 --> 0:0:17,59
Now, the effects of Iceland's volcanoes would be felt on a global scale


4
0:0:17,59 --> 0:0:24,37
For thusands of years Iceland's volcanoes were locked in a titanic battle with ice


5
0:0:24,37 --> 0:0:31,14
But then, 12.000 years ago, the giant ice sheets finally retreated


6
0:0:31,14 --> 0:0:35,12
This would open a new chapter in Iceland's volcanic history,


7
0:0:35,12 --> 0:0:38,92
as they were now free to wreak havoc


8
0:0:38,92 --> 0:0:45,76
But, what effect would this have on Iceland and its surroundings?


9
0:0:45,76 --> 0:0:53,6
One of the most dramatic effects can be found in the south-central region of the island


10
0:0:53,6 --> 0:0:59,47
This alien landscape is known as Laki


11
0:0:59,47 --> 0:1:2,54
A road of strange craters and solidified lava flows


12
0:1:2,54 --> 0:1:7,21
that have bubbled up from a huge tear in the earth


13
0:1:7,21 --> 0:1:18,26
A massive fissure eruption, it stretches for an astounding 16 miles (25 Km) across the landscape


14
0:1:18,26 --> 0:1:21,79
Volcanologist Dr. Thor Thordarson is investigating Laki,


15
0:1:21,79 --> 0:1:25,55
the site of one of the greatest eruptions in recent history,


16
0:1:25,55 --> 0:1:30,16
one which would have devastating effects worldwide


17
0:1:30,16 --> 0:1:34,53
The Laki fissures, which extend from here in the southwest,


18
0:1:34,53 --> 0:1:40,67
continue here through the landscape as roll cones, up in through Mount Laki


19
0:1:40,67 --> 0:1:42,77
which was split into 2 during the eruption


20
0:1:42,77 --> 0:1:51,16
and continue futher to the northeast all the way to the margins of the glaciers here


21
0:1:51,16 --> 0:1:56,46
Eyewitness accounts accurately date the eruption to 1783


22
0:1:56,46 --> 0:2:1,91
This was one of the most disastrous years in Icelandic history


23
0:2:1,91 --> 0:2:6,73
Fallout from the eruption caused harvests all over the island to fail


24
0:2:6,73 --> 0:2:17,31
75% of the livestock died, plunging Iceland into a great famine which killed 10.000 people


25
0:2:17,31 --> 0:2:21,36
But mysteriously, at the same time the rest of the northern hemisphere


26
0:2:21,36 --> 0:2:25,81
reported freakishly cold weather


27
0:2:25,81 --> 0:2:34,37
Averaging 2,3 ÂºF (1,28ÂºC) below normal, the northern hemisphere froze over


28
0:2:34,37 --> 0:2:36,87
The North Sea along the coast of Holland froze,


29
0:2:36,87 --> 0:2:39,54
so people skated between villages along the coast


30
0:2:39,54 --> 0:2:47,84
There was on Mississippi down by New Orleans in that winter


31
0:2:47,84 --> 0:2:54,12
For many years it was thought the Laki eruption and this climatic events were unrelated,


32
0:2:54,12 --> 0:3:0,9
but advances in geology found it wasn't just a bizarre coincidence


33
0:3:0,9 --> 0:3:3,6
Comparing eyewitness accounts with the geological remains


34
0:3:3,6 --> 0:3:9,87
Dr. Thordarson has reconstructed what happened


35
0:3:9,87 --> 0:3:16,21
He discovered that the eruption started with a bang on the morning of June 8, 1783


36
0:3:16,21 --> 0:3:18,98
It sent rocks flying high into the air


37
0:3:18,98 --> 0:3:23,6
and ripped the earth open along a 1 mile (1,6 Km) tear


38
0:3:23,6 --> 0:3:27,45
But this was just the beginning


39
0:3:27,45 --> 0:3:34,79
3 days later, a second eruption ripped open, then a 3rd, 4th, 5th...


40
0:3:34,79 --> 0:3:39,81
In total, the earth unzipped along 10 vast tears in the crust


41
0:3:39,81 --> 0:3:45,13
erupting lava continuously for over 8 months


42
0:3:45,13 --> 0:3:48,68
The mammoth amounts of lava that poured out of the ground here


43
0:3:48,68 --> 0:3:54,69
would have buried Manhattah to a depth of 830 feet (250 m)


44
0:3:54,69 --> 0:3:59,3
But how an eruption on this small, remote island could cause climatic chaos


45
0:3:59,3 --> 0:4:5,93
thousands of miles away, remained a mystery


46
0:4:5,93 --> 0:4:9,36
The evidence that would link Laki with this worldwide catastrophe


47
0:4:9,36 --> 0:4:16,1
was locked inside these boulders


48
0:4:16,1 --> 0:4:19,51
The story is in the rocks. This rock here is part of


49
0:4:19,51 --> 0:4:23,48
the material, the magma that came out during the eruption


50
0:4:23,48 --> 0:4:26,71
These holes are cold bubbles,


51
0:4:26,71 --> 0:4:32,79
and they form as the magma raises from deep within the ground and approaches the surface


52
0:4:32,79 --> 0:4:34,55
and it really starts to boil!


53
0:4:34,55 --> 0:4:38,93
The gas, which is dissolved in the magma at depth, goes into the bubbles


54
0:4:38,93 --> 0:4:42,76
then it escapes into the atmosphere


55
0:4:42,76 --> 0:4:45,4
When this bubble rock erupted onto the surface


56
0:4:45,4 --> 0:4:52,67
it would have poured gas out into the Icelandic atmosphere


57
0:4:52,67 --> 0:5:0,59
Could this gas have caused climatic chaos across the globe?


58
0:5:0,59 --> 0:5:5,72
The identity of this gas can be found in the microscopic structure of the rock


59
0:5:5,72 --> 0:5:10,2
If you look closely at this rock, you can see a lot of white specks


60
0:5:10,2 --> 0:5:14,73
these little white specks are the crystals who grow in the magma at depth


61
0:5:14,73 --> 0:5:18,26
Sometimes this crystals, as they're growing, they would encapsulate


62
0:5:18,26 --> 0:5:22,67
pristine magma and bring it up to the surface


63
0:5:22,67 --> 0:5:28,41
Like time capsules, the white crystals contained untouched magma from deep in the earth


64
0:5:28,41 --> 0:5:33,22
locked away since 1783


65
0:5:33,22 --> 0:5:40,78
Dr. Thordarson has analysed this magma and found it to contain poisonous Sulphur Dioxide


66
0:5:40,78 --> 0:5:47,1
And because there was so much lava here, it would have released enormous amounts


67
0:5:47,1 --> 0:5:56,76
A staggering 100 million tons of Sulphur Dioxide gas was pumped into the atmosphere


68
0:5:56,76 --> 0:6:2,94
But how could gases released from Laki cause bitterly cold weather across the globe?


69
0:6:2,94 --> 0:6:10,85
The answer laid in accounts of a thick, red fog reported over Iceland in June 1783


70
0:6:10,85 --> 0:6:15,6
Within a few weeks it had been blown over London and Paris


71
0:6:15,6 --> 0:6:21,27
By July, it had dispersed across the entire northern hemisphere


72
0:6:21,27 --> 0:6:29,29
Scientists now know that the red fog was caused by the Sulphur Dioxide which rose high into the air


73
0:6:29,29 --> 0:6:35,0
Mixing with water, it created a Sulphuric Acid haze


74
0:6:35,0 --> 0:6:40,72
The haze blocked out the sun, and it sent temperatures plummeting


75
0:6:40,72 --> 0:6:45,71
As a result, the northern hemisphere endured 3 bitterly cold winters


76
0:6:45,71 --> 0:6:53,2
which brought spring floods, famine and widespread poverty to Europe


77
0:6:53,2 --> 0:6:56,97
Some historians have long believed that these climatic conditions


78
0:6:56,97 --> 0:7:4,73
triggered social and political unrest, which led to the French Revolution in 1789


79
0:7:4,73 --> 0:7:10,97
But scientists now suspect Laki had ramifications even further afield


80
0:7:10,97 --> 0:7:14,95
The cold temperatures in the north changed air currents in the south


81
0:7:14,95 --> 0:7:18,47
causing dramatic climate changes


82
0:7:18,47 --> 0:7:22,12
India was hit by a terrible drought


83
0:7:22,12 --> 0:7:29,15
People say that more than half a million people died from the drought in India


84
0:7:29,15 --> 0:7:34,82
Also, this change in atmospheric circulation caused a very cold summer in Japan


85
0:7:34,82 --> 0:7:36,51
It was cold and wet


86
0:7:36,51 --> 0:7:40,11
The rice harvest failed,


87
0:7:40,11 --> 0:7:44,69
and the result was the greatest famine in japanese history


88
0:7:44,69 --> 0:7:50,41
It is estimated that Laki killed over 2 million people worldwide,


89
0:7:50,41 --> 0:7:58,29
and was one of the most devastating volcanic eruptions in the history of mankind


90
0:7:58,29 --> 0:8:1,43
The evidence has proven that Iceland's recent volcanic history


91
0:8:1,43 --> 0:8:6,93
has had a devastating effect on the island and the rest of the world


92
0:8:6,93 --> 0:8:13,11
Enormous lava fields reveal that Laki was a gigantic eruption


93
0:8:13,11 --> 0:8:19,7
Bubbles in the rock indicate that huge volumes of gas were released from Laki


94
0:8:19,7 --> 0:8:24,48
The white crystals reveal that this gas was poisonous Sulphur Dioxide,


95
0:8:24,48 --> 0:8:32,4
evidence that Iceland's volcanoes caused climatic mayhem across the globe


96
0:8:32,4 --> 0:8:36,79
But eruptions like Laki may not be confined to the past


97
0:8:36,79 --> 0:8:40,57
Some believe that the balance between fire and ice is shifting,


98
0:8:40,57 --> 0:8:50,59
and has the potential to propel Iceland into another hell on earth


99
0:8:50,59 --> 0:8:57,88
The evidence is mounting, that Iceland has the potential to be the most lethal island on the planet


100
0:8:57,88 --> 0:9:2,73
A fearsome volcanic force lies beneath it, creating powerful volcanoes


101
0:9:2,73 --> 0:9:10,66
capable of generating gigantic lava flows and altering global climates


102
0:9:10,66 --> 0:9:14,41
Yet many of Iceland's volcanoes are covered in glaciers,


103
0:9:14,41 --> 0:9:19,67
fire and ice are held in a delicate balance


104
0:9:19,67 --> 0:9:23,41
Scientists fear if this balance were tipped the volcanoes favour,


105
0:9:23,41 --> 0:9:27,88
Iceland could become even deadlier


106
0:9:27,88 --> 0:9:30,46
If the remaining ice were to melt,


107
0:9:30,46 --> 0:9:36,82
what effect would it have on the activity of Iceland's volcanoes?


108
0:9:36,82 --> 0:9:44,59
The first clue in the investigation lies in these innocuous-looking piles of rock and rubble


109
0:9:44,59 --> 0:9:46,26
They're found all over Iceland,


110
0:9:46,26 --> 0:9:51,27
and yet this rocks don't come from a volcano


111
0:9:51,27 --> 0:9:52,58
They're Morraines:


112
0:9:52,58 --> 0:9:58,71
The geological term for rock piles deposited at the mouth of a glacier


113
0:9:58,71 --> 0:10:4,91
These deposits are evidence that the glaciers are shrinking


114
0:10:4,91 --> 0:10:9,16
Year by year, the glacier has melted and retreated back up the valley,


115
0:10:9,16 --> 0:10:17,43
leaving a Morraine like this behind


116
0:10:17,43 --> 0:10:21,4
Dr. Roberts has studied the VatnajÃ¶kull glacier for the last ten years


117
0:10:21,4 --> 0:10:24,6
and has noticed this dramatic trend


118
0:10:24,6 --> 0:10:28,77
The glacier is retreating at a remarkable rate since I've been visiting the area


119
0:10:28,77 --> 0:10:32,68
I've seen tremendous changes. The ice has retreated annually at a rate of about


120
0:10:32,68 --> 0:10:38,49
200 feet (61 m) per year. This lake over here used to be filled with ice


121
0:10:38,49 --> 0:10:41,6
I've seen the ice progressively melt, this morraine has formed,


122
0:10:41,6 --> 0:10:44,56
this whole valley has become almost bare


123
0:10:44,56 --> 0:10:50,56
Maybe in the next 20 years this whole glacier will disappear and a lake will form in that valley


124
0:10:50,56 --> 0:10:55,27
Iceland's glaciers are melting at an unprecedented rate


125
0:10:55,27 --> 0:10:59,77
With 5% of Iceland's ice caps melting in the last 40 years,


126
0:10:59,77 --> 0:11:3,15
the question that scientists are keen to understand


127
0:11:3,15 --> 0:11:10,49
is: What effect this rapid melting will have on the volcanoes that lie beneath?


128
0:11:10,49 --> 0:11:13,39
The only other time that glaciers have melted this quickly


129
0:11:13,39 --> 0:11:18,76
is when Iceland came out of the last Ice Age


130
0:11:18,76 --> 0:11:24,81
But what can past events tell us about the future?


131
0:11:24,81 --> 0:11:30,14
Geologist professor Bill McGuire is investigating how volcanic activity changed


132
0:11:30,14 --> 0:11:32,77
at the end of the last Ice Age


133
0:11:32,77 --> 0:11:37,21
And he's unearthed some surprising results


134
0:11:37,21 --> 0:11:42,48
Around about 11 or 12 thousand years ago you started to see quite rapid melting of glaciers


135
0:11:42,48 --> 0:11:43,84
in Iceland and elsewhere


136
0:11:43,84 --> 0:11:47,77
And that triggered a recognisable increase of volcanic activity,


137
0:11:47,77 --> 0:11:51,79
because you were removing this large mass of ice very, very quickly


138
0:11:51,79 --> 0:11:56,2
The rapid melting of ice kick-starts volcanic eruptions beneath


139
0:11:56,2 --> 0:11:59,94
Volcanic eruptions are triggered by the gas in the magma,


140
0:11:59,94 --> 0:12:3,1
which expands to form bubbles and the bubbles drive the eruption


141
0:12:3,1 --> 0:12:6,75
It's rather like taking the cork out of a bottle of champagne


142
0:12:6,75 --> 0:12:10,27
Now, if you have a very heavy weight on top of a volcano,


143
0:12:10,27 --> 0:12:12,37
if it's a heavy mass of water or ice,


144
0:12:12,37 --> 0:12:16,82
that can help supress eruptive activity


145
0:12:16,82 --> 0:12:21,39
But when ice melts quickly, this downward pressure is suddenly released


146
0:12:21,39 --> 0:12:25,23
and that's when the trouble starts


147
0:12:25,23 --> 0:12:28,92
As the ice melts, so the pressure on the magma underneath is reduced,


148
0:12:28,92 --> 0:12:33,27
the gas in the magma can form bubbles, they can coalesce and they can eventually


149
0:12:33,27 --> 0:12:36,14
drive the magma upwards towards the surface and trigger


150
0:12:36,14 --> 0:12:44,9
other explosive eruptions or effusions of lava that are spared out at a huge distances


151
0:12:44,9 --> 0:12:47,54
Iceland's glaciers are melting rapidly


152
0:12:47,54 --> 0:12:52,63
This has led scientists to believe that a devastating eruption on the scale of Laki


153
0:12:52,63 --> 0:12:54,23
could happen again


154
0:12:54,23 --> 0:12:58,12
The question is WHEN? These are things that we have to think about


155
0:12:58,12 --> 0:13:3,73
and try to prepare ourselves to deal with if they happen in our lifetime


156
0:13:3,73 --> 0:13:9,42
Is it possible that we can get another eruption like this in Iceland?


157
0:13:9,42 --> 0:13:12,7
Definetely


158
0:13:12,7 --> 0:13:20,75
The investigation has revealed how the vast and voilent island of Iceland was formed


159
0:13:20,75 --> 0:13:25,2
Cracks in the Thingvellir plane and traces of chemicals in the rocks


160
0:13:25,2 --> 0:13:34,84
revealed how the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and Hot Spot joined forces to create a collossal volcanic force


161
0:13:34,84 --> 0:13:38,78
Massive fissure eruptions ripped the land open


162
0:13:38,78 --> 0:13:44,69
Hemorrhaging millions of tons of lava, Iceland rapidly formed


163
0:13:44,69 --> 0:13:49,24
Deep northern fjords were evidence that a giant ice sheet eroded the land 


164
0:13:49,24 --> 0:13:57,37
and entombed the volcanoes, locking fire and ice in a titanic battle


165
0:13:57,37 --> 0:14:3,31
Boulders strewn in an ancient valley reveal how fire emerged victorious


166
0:14:3,31 --> 0:14:7,6
unleashing cataclysmic floods


167
0:14:7,6 --> 0:14:11,26
And specks of Sulphur in the rocks showed how Iceland's volcanoes


168
0:14:11,26 --> 0:14:16,15
have the potential to cause global destruction


169
0:14:16,15 --> 0:14:20,64
Now, glaciers melting above some of the world's most deadly volcanoes


170
0:14:20,64 --> 0:14:28,9
are increasing the threat of future eruptions


171
0:14:28,9 --> 0:14:32,37
Over the last 20 million years, Iceland's almighty volcanic force


172
0:14:32,37 --> 0:14:37,26
has created a vast, alien landscape


173
0:14:37,26 --> 0:14:42,2
Volatile and unpredictable, it may one day unleash a massive eruption


174
0:14:42,2 --> 0:14:48,71
which could devastate both Iceland and a wider world beyond


175
