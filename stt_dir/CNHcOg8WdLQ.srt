0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:0,45
STEVE SPANGLER: All right.


2
0:0:0,45 --> 0:0:3,44
So the question today is how
quickly can you get the water


3
0:0:3,44 --> 0:0:4,16
out of the bottle.


4
0:0:4,16 --> 0:0:4,49
All right?


5
0:0:4,49 --> 0:0:5,99
It's a clever little trick.


6
0:0:5,99 --> 0:0:9,7
I want you to think of this
as not a plastic bottle, a


7
0:0:9,7 --> 0:0:9,83
one-liter bottle.


8
0:0:9,83 --> 0:0:12,1
Pretend like it was glass, so
you can't turn it over and


9
0:0:12,1 --> 0:0:13,51
just squeeze the water
out like this.


10
0:0:13,51 --> 0:0:15,54
You have to let it flow.


11
0:0:15,54 --> 0:0:17,93
How do you get the water
out of the bottle as


12
0:0:17,93 --> 0:0:18,81
quickly as you can?


13
0:0:18,81 --> 0:0:19,58
Well, take a look at this.


14
0:0:19,58 --> 0:0:22,7
You're pretty well limited by
the fact that as the water


15
0:0:22,7 --> 0:0:23,11
goes down, the air goes up.


16
0:0:23,11 --> 0:0:25,19
You have to remember it's
not an empty bottle.


17
0:0:25,19 --> 0:0:27,3
There's air inside the bottle.


18
0:0:27,3 --> 0:0:29,97
So how can we get the air to
come in and the water to come


19
0:0:29,97 --> 0:0:32,369
out exactly at the same time?


20
0:0:32,369 --> 0:0:34,28
If you could, the water would
come out pretty quickly.


21
0:0:34,28 --> 0:0:36,38
And I've got some ideas.


22
0:0:36,38 --> 0:0:38,1
I'm Steve Spangler.


23
0:0:38,1 --> 0:0:40,0
And I'm all about making
science fun.


24
0:0:40,0 --> 0:0:42,99
For the last 20 years, I've
been teaching ways to turn


25
0:0:42,99 --> 0:0:46,0
ordinary science experiments
into unforgettable learning


26
0:0:46,0 --> 0:0:47,2
experiences.


27
0:0:47,2 --> 0:0:49,66
I have an amazing team who will
do whatever it takes to


28
0:0:49,66 --> 0:0:52,13
affect the way people
think about science.


29
0:0:52,13 --> 0:0:54,68
And to do that, I live
by one motto.


30
0:0:54,68 --> 0:0:55,82
Make it big.


31
0:0:55,82 --> 0:0:57,8
Do it right.


32
0:0:57,8 --> 0:0:58,33
Give it class.


33
0:0:58,33 --> 0:1:3,35



34
0:1:3,35 --> 0:1:4,19
Here's an idea.


35
0:1:4,19 --> 0:1:4,98
You could do this.


36
0:1:4,98 --> 0:1:6,5
If you watch very closely--
watch this.


37
0:1:6,5 --> 0:1:9,16
As you tip it like this,
the water comes out.


38
0:1:9,16 --> 0:1:9,98
The air comes in.


39
0:1:9,98 --> 0:1:10,9
You see this?


40
0:1:10,9 --> 0:1:11,73
The water comes out.


41
0:1:11,73 --> 0:1:12,66
The air comes in.


42
0:1:12,66 --> 0:1:13,66
That flow is pretty good.


43
0:1:13,66 --> 0:1:15,89
The problem is it's
not very fast.


44
0:1:15,89 --> 0:1:16,5
Water comes out.


45
0:1:16,5 --> 0:1:17,54
The air comes in.


46
0:1:17,54 --> 0:1:19,72
And then you just get mad,
and you just do this.


47
0:1:19,72 --> 0:1:21,87
But still, you're limited by
the fact that it exchanges.


48
0:1:21,87 --> 0:1:24,38
You almost want the air to come
in here and the water to


49
0:1:24,38 --> 0:1:25,12
come out here.


50
0:1:25,12 --> 0:1:27,32
And I've got a solution
for that, as well.


51
0:1:27,32 --> 0:1:28,615
Get yourself a drill.


52
0:1:28,615 --> 0:1:28,99
All right?


53
0:1:28,99 --> 0:1:32,8
So now, if you just stick a
tiny hole in the side here


54
0:1:32,8 --> 0:1:34,93
like this--


55
0:1:34,93 --> 0:1:35,36
perfect.


56
0:1:35,36 --> 0:1:37,71
And then cover this up.


57
0:1:37,71 --> 0:1:38,865
Honestly, it's not a problem.


58
0:1:38,865 --> 0:1:40,4
Nobody will really care.


59
0:1:40,4 --> 0:1:41,25
Now watch this.


60
0:1:41,25 --> 0:1:44,74
If you turn it upside down,
and you do this, watch.


61
0:1:44,74 --> 0:1:45,4
The air comes in.


62
0:1:45,4 --> 0:1:46,8
The water comes out.


63
0:1:46,8 --> 0:1:49,66
The air comes-- now that's
pretty clever.


64
0:1:49,66 --> 0:1:51,956
However, you do have to carry
this around whenever you want


65
0:1:51,956 --> 0:1:54,43
to do the little science
experiment, so I would not


66
0:1:54,43 --> 0:1:55,22
suggest this method.


67
0:1:55,22 --> 0:1:56,285
There's an easier method.


68
0:1:56,285 --> 0:1:58,34
You just have to know something
about the science.


69
0:1:58,34 --> 0:2:0,21
And you have to create a vortex
inside the bottle.


70
0:2:0,21 --> 0:2:2,56
So you turn the whole
thing upside down,


71
0:2:2,56 --> 0:2:3,27
hand here on the bottom.


72
0:2:3,27 --> 0:2:4,22
And you spin.


73
0:2:4,22 --> 0:2:8,9
And as you spin, you create
this vortex inside.


74
0:2:8,9 --> 0:2:10,889
So as you release,
the air comes up.


75
0:2:10,889 --> 0:2:11,72
The water comes down.


76
0:2:11,72 --> 0:2:12,29
The air comes up.


77
0:2:12,29 --> 0:2:13,43
The water comes down.


78
0:2:13,43 --> 0:2:16,59
And you dump the whole thing
in about four seconds.


79
0:2:16,59 --> 0:2:19,28
So why is this little
trick useful?


80
0:2:19,28 --> 0:2:19,97
It's not.


81
0:2:19,97 --> 0:2:22,53
It's just a clever little trick
to do with a one- or a


82
0:2:22,53 --> 0:2:23,67
two-liter bottle.


83
0:2:23,67 --> 0:2:27,36
Or if you're a dishwasher, I
guess you could empty water


84
0:2:27,36 --> 0:2:30,9
out of a bottle or a container
very, very quickly.


85
0:2:30,9 --> 0:2:33,16
It was useful, however, for
a man by the name of Craig


86
0:2:33,16 --> 0:2:36,95
Burnham back in 1964 because
he invented one of the most


87
0:2:36,95 --> 0:2:39,71
popular science toys in
the entire world.


88
0:2:39,71 --> 0:2:42,86
And it's called a
tornado tube.


89
0:2:42,86 --> 0:2:45,13
Like so many good inventions,
it all started with play.


90
0:2:45,13 --> 0:2:48,23
And so Craig was playing
around in the basement.


91
0:2:48,23 --> 0:2:50,54
He was actually trying
to make an hourglass.


92
0:2:50,54 --> 0:2:53,86
So he had two glass bottles,
not these plastic one-liter


93
0:2:53,86 --> 0:2:56,26
bottles, two glass
apple juice jugs.


94
0:2:56,26 --> 0:2:59,48
And he wanted to find a way to
hook them together and to fill


95
0:2:59,48 --> 0:3:2,99
up, for example, with sand, so
that one would flow from top


96
0:3:2,99 --> 0:3:3,94
to the bottom.


97
0:3:3,94 --> 0:3:6,33
Didn't have any sand,
so he tried dirt.


98
0:3:6,33 --> 0:3:7,66
That's a good idea.


99
0:3:7,66 --> 0:3:8,81
Well, here's dirt.


100
0:3:8,81 --> 0:3:10,19
This is a great idea, right?


101
0:3:10,19 --> 0:3:11,46
So you got your dirt.


102
0:3:11,46 --> 0:3:15,12
Now you're just going
to shake it out.


103
0:3:15,12 --> 0:3:17,202
This is a horrible idea.


104
0:3:17,202 --> 0:3:18,37
Craig knew that.


105
0:3:18,37 --> 0:3:21,36
That's why he had to come
up with another option.


106
0:3:21,36 --> 0:3:23,69
This does nothing.


107
0:3:23,69 --> 0:3:25,47
So he had a better idea.


108
0:3:25,47 --> 0:3:28,94
Try using either salt
or possibly sugar.


109
0:3:28,94 --> 0:3:31,34
See, if you fill the bottle with
salt or sugar, then you


110
0:3:31,34 --> 0:3:32,88
don't get the clumping
with the dirt.


111
0:3:32,88 --> 0:3:36,675
When you turn it over, you
do get this great flow.


112
0:3:36,675 --> 0:3:39,81
The problem is mom shut this
idea down real fast because


113
0:3:39,81 --> 0:3:41,25
it's just too expensive.


114
0:3:41,25 --> 0:3:44,67
So Craig came up with a simple
solution, water.


115
0:3:44,67 --> 0:3:45,52
The problem was this.


116
0:3:45,52 --> 0:3:48,466
He just knew that the water
would go from one bottle to


117
0:3:48,466 --> 0:3:50,58
the next bottle too quickly
when he turned it over.


118
0:3:50,58 --> 0:3:51,85
At least that's what
he thought.


119
0:3:51,85 --> 0:3:57,23
So to slow the whole process
down, he used a metal washer.


120
0:3:57,23 --> 0:4:0,85
And the washer went right
on the top of


121
0:4:0,85 --> 0:4:3,68
the bottle like this.


122
0:4:3,68 --> 0:4:5,76
And the other bottle goes
right on the top.


123
0:4:5,76 --> 0:4:9,24
But the question is how do
you keep them together.


124
0:4:9,24 --> 0:4:12,12
Well, Craig used radiator
hose and clamps.


125
0:4:12,12 --> 0:4:14,26
And he was much smarter
than I am.


126
0:4:14,26 --> 0:4:17,78
A little duct tape
would be perfect.


127
0:4:17,78 --> 0:4:20,5
This is perfect.


128
0:4:20,5 --> 0:4:23,28
What you want to do is you want
to just wrap the bottle


129
0:4:23,28 --> 0:4:23,89
up like this.


130
0:4:23,89 --> 0:4:25,5
So this goes here.


131
0:4:25,5 --> 0:4:28,74
Now you just wrap it up, because
everything is better


132
0:4:28,74 --> 0:4:30,25
with duct tape.


133
0:4:30,25 --> 0:4:33,5
If it wasn't for duct tape,
where would the world be?


134
0:4:33,5 --> 0:4:34,25
This will be perfect.


135
0:4:34,25 --> 0:4:36,56
Why wouldn't this work well?


136
0:4:36,56 --> 0:4:37,11
All right.


137
0:4:37,11 --> 0:4:38,3
So there you have it.


138
0:4:38,3 --> 0:4:39,11
The bottles are hooked
together.


139
0:4:39,11 --> 0:4:40,53
The washer's in place.


140
0:4:40,53 --> 0:4:42,25
It's time for an hourglass.


141
0:4:42,25 --> 0:4:44,17
Just turn it upside down.


142
0:4:44,17 --> 0:4:45,42
Go.


143
0:4:45,42 --> 0:4:47,41



144
0:4:47,41 --> 0:4:48,54
Go.


145
0:4:48,54 --> 0:4:50,9
Just go.


146
0:4:50,9 --> 0:4:53,49
And this is the problem
he discovered.


147
0:4:53,49 --> 0:4:55,3
It doesn't go.


148
0:4:55,3 --> 0:4:56,67
See, there's something
inside this bottle.


149
0:4:56,67 --> 0:4:58,84
Although it seems like it's
empty, there's air.


150
0:4:58,84 --> 0:4:59,95
And the air pushes up.


151
0:4:59,95 --> 0:5:1,33
And the water can't get down.


152
0:5:1,33 --> 0:5:4,43
And again, another
colossal failure.


153
0:5:4,43 --> 0:5:7,2
So he shook it in frustration
because he was mad that the


154
0:5:7,2 --> 0:5:8,2
whole thing didn't work.


155
0:5:8,2 --> 0:5:11,27
And that's when he made the
discovery that a vortex would


156
0:5:11,27 --> 0:5:14,4
appear inside, allowing the air
to come up and the water


157
0:5:14,4 --> 0:5:14,71
to go down.


158
0:5:14,71 --> 0:5:17,83
The air to go up, the
water to go down.


159
0:5:17,83 --> 0:5:21,9
It was the perfect little
toy if you were a kid.


160
0:5:21,9 --> 0:5:23,74
He made a tornado in a bottle.


161
0:5:23,74 --> 0:5:25,71
Well, fast forward 24 years.


162
0:5:25,71 --> 0:5:27,79
And you get this device here
called a tornado tube.


163
0:5:27,79 --> 0:5:29,98
It's actually a piece of plastic
that has threads on


164
0:5:29,98 --> 0:5:30,98
either side.


165
0:5:30,98 --> 0:5:32,46
But the inside is the secret.


166
0:5:32,46 --> 0:5:33,85
See that opening right there?


167
0:5:33,85 --> 0:5:35,455
It looks like a washer.


168
0:5:35,455 --> 0:5:36,505
That's because it is.


169
0:5:36,505 --> 0:5:39,7
It's modeled right after the
washer that he put in the


170
0:5:39,7 --> 0:5:41,51
first bottles.


171
0:5:41,51 --> 0:5:44,28
This simply goes over
the top like this.


172
0:5:44,28 --> 0:5:47,58
The other bottle goes
onto the top.


173
0:5:47,58 --> 0:5:49,91
And now, you have one
of the most popular


174
0:5:49,91 --> 0:5:51,68
science toys of all times.


175
0:5:51,68 --> 0:5:55,1
Craig introduced this toy at the
New York Toy Fair in 1988.


176
0:5:55,1 --> 0:5:57,78
It was an immediate success
because it was great.


177
0:5:57,78 --> 0:6:0,45
You could just use recycled
one- and two-liter bottles


178
0:6:0,45 --> 0:6:2,5
with a little connector
to create a


179
0:6:2,5 --> 0:6:4,3
tornado inside of a bottle.


180
0:6:4,3 --> 0:6:6,43
But as you look at this, there's
got to be more to do


181
0:6:6,43 --> 0:6:10,56
than just create a tornado
or a vortex in a bottle.


182
0:6:10,56 --> 0:6:13,61
In fact, some people have even
gone so far as to write a book


183
0:6:13,61 --> 0:6:16,13
about things you can do
with a tornado tube.


184
0:6:16,13 --> 0:6:18,57
I just came across this one
called Taming the Tornado


185
0:6:18,57 --> 0:6:21,76
Tube: 50 Weird and Wacky Things
To Do With a Tornado


186
0:6:21,76 --> 0:6:25,18
Tube, written by
Steve Spangler.


187
0:6:25,18 --> 0:6:26,67
Well, there's lots of
ideas in the book.


188
0:6:26,67 --> 0:6:29,11
But I've got to show you one of
my favorites, inspired by a


189
0:6:29,11 --> 0:6:31,95
kid who started with wanting
to color the air


190
0:6:31,95 --> 0:6:32,65
inside of the bottle.


191
0:6:32,65 --> 0:6:33,84
How do you color air?


192
0:6:33,84 --> 0:6:35,43
It's pretty simple.


193
0:6:35,43 --> 0:6:36,45
Dish soap.


194
0:6:36,45 --> 0:6:39,65
Well, you start with a little
bit of water inside and a


195
0:6:39,65 --> 0:6:41,99
couple drops of dish soap.


196
0:6:41,99 --> 0:6:46,55
And then you hook the
other bottle on top.


197
0:6:46,55 --> 0:6:50,84
The trick here is that you have
to shake it up first.


198
0:6:50,84 --> 0:6:53,17
Remember, her idea was
to be able to see the


199
0:6:53,17 --> 0:6:54,21
air inside the bottle.


200
0:6:54,21 --> 0:6:56,61
How do you color air?


201
0:6:56,61 --> 0:6:57,65
You don't really color air.


202
0:6:57,65 --> 0:7:2,89
But you can make something to
take up the space of the air.


203
0:7:2,89 --> 0:7:4,87
And this is what
it looks like.


204
0:7:4,87 --> 0:7:6,37
This got me to thinking.


205
0:7:6,37 --> 0:7:9,36
If you can define the space
where the air is, how could


206
0:7:9,36 --> 0:7:10,916
you color the vortex?


207
0:7:10,916 --> 0:7:13,2
Is there any way to be able
to differentiate the


208
0:7:13,2 --> 0:7:16,47
vortex from the water?


209
0:7:16,47 --> 0:7:17,78
It's in the pantry.


210
0:7:17,78 --> 0:7:20,23
So the object here is just to
define the difference between


211
0:7:20,23 --> 0:7:22,62
the water and whatever
else is inside.


212
0:7:22,62 --> 0:7:24,51
And just turn to the--


213
0:7:24,51 --> 0:7:25,86
Higgins, what are you
doing in here?


214
0:7:25,86 --> 0:7:27,96
HIGGINS: We're still shooting?


215
0:7:27,96 --> 0:7:28,8
I thought we were on break.


216
0:7:28,8 --> 0:7:29,72
STEVE SPANGLER: Just
stay there.


217
0:7:29,72 --> 0:7:32,72
The secret, oil.


218
0:7:32,72 --> 0:7:35,51
I'll see you.


219
0:7:35,51 --> 0:7:36,85
The idea was pretty simple.


220
0:7:36,85 --> 0:7:38,15
Oil and water don't mix.


221
0:7:38,15 --> 0:7:41,51
And so if I wanted to find just
the vortex, maybe I could


222
0:7:41,51 --> 0:7:43,7
spin oil to the top and
allow that to go


223
0:7:43,7 --> 0:7:44,35
into the very middle.


224
0:7:44,35 --> 0:7:48,57
So suffice it to say, I picked
up a ton of oil as I was


225
0:7:48,57 --> 0:7:52,35
playing with this to try to see
if the oil and the water


226
0:7:52,35 --> 0:7:53,6
would work.


227
0:7:53,6 --> 0:7:55,84



228
0:7:55,84 --> 0:7:58,2
See, you just turn the whole
thing upside down,


229
0:7:58,2 --> 0:7:59,27
and you spin it.


230
0:7:59,27 --> 0:8:1,88



231
0:8:1,88 --> 0:8:4,95
As you can see, unfortunately,
this idea didn't work.


232
0:8:4,95 --> 0:8:6,9
The oil is too viscous.


233
0:8:6,9 --> 0:8:8,72
It doesn't flow down nicely.


234
0:8:8,72 --> 0:8:10,29
It doesn't define anything.


235
0:8:10,29 --> 0:8:11,58
I can't see what's going on.


236
0:8:11,58 --> 0:8:14,985
Maybe a different kind of oil,
or this oil, or this oil.


237
0:8:14,985 --> 0:8:16,43
I'll save you the headache.


238
0:8:16,43 --> 0:8:17,58
It doesn't work.


239
0:8:17,58 --> 0:8:19,27
There was only one solution.


240
0:8:19,27 --> 0:8:20,96
And it worked really,
really well.


241
0:8:20,96 --> 0:8:22,23
Well, the secret is oil.


242
0:8:22,23 --> 0:8:24,43
It's just not any oil that
you'll find in your pantry.


243
0:8:24,43 --> 0:8:27,2
That's because it's
colored lamp oil.


244
0:8:27,2 --> 0:8:31,1
See, I saw the lamp oil in the
department store and noticed


245
0:8:31,1 --> 0:8:33,14
that it's about the same
thickness, or has the same


246
0:8:33,14 --> 0:8:35,1
viscosity, as water.


247
0:8:35,1 --> 0:8:36,82
That was part of the problem
with the other bottle there is


248
0:8:36,82 --> 0:8:37,78
it was clogging.


249
0:8:37,78 --> 0:8:39,179
It was that bubbling.


250
0:8:39,179 --> 0:8:40,4
And it didn't seem to work.


251
0:8:40,4 --> 0:8:41,2
Watch this.


252
0:8:41,2 --> 0:8:45,74
This is just the lamp oil
at the top and the


253
0:8:45,74 --> 0:8:46,7
water at the bottom.


254
0:8:46,7 --> 0:8:47,4
It's colored.


255
0:8:47,4 --> 0:8:49,33
And you remember, you can't
color regular oil.


256
0:8:49,33 --> 0:8:50,65
So you have to buy it colored.


257
0:8:50,65 --> 0:8:52,54
Well, watch what happens
when you spin this one.


258
0:8:52,54 --> 0:8:56,79



259
0:8:56,79 --> 0:8:58,91
You see, the lamp oil
helps define the


260
0:8:58,91 --> 0:9:0,31
vortex in the very middle.


261
0:9:0,31 --> 0:9:3,14
That way, you get a defined
red vortex as it


262
0:9:3,14 --> 0:9:4,46
works its way down.


263
0:9:4,46 --> 0:9:7,9
And it only cost me about $700
worth of all the oil that I


264
0:9:7,9 --> 0:9:10,77
experimented with to finally
come up with this idea.


265
0:9:10,77 --> 0:9:11,95
Well, this is cool.


266
0:9:11,95 --> 0:9:13,1
But we need more ideas.


267
0:9:13,1 --> 0:9:14,73
We need 30 ideas.


268
0:9:14,73 --> 0:9:15,96
And you don't have
a lot of time.


269
0:9:15,96 --> 0:9:18,65
So 30 ideas in 30 seconds.


270
0:9:18,65 --> 0:9:19,94
It can be done.


271
0:9:19,94 --> 0:9:20,92
Ready.


272
0:9:20,92 --> 0:9:21,92
Get set.


273
0:9:21,92 --> 0:9:23,11
Start the clock.


274
0:9:23,11 --> 0:9:25,25
Go.

0:9:25,25 --> 0:9:26,19

0:9:30,2 --> 0:9:31,41
Horse clappers.


283
0:9:31,41 --> 0:9:32,45
Water balloon inflator.


284
0:9:32,45 --> 0:9:33,55
Bongo drum.


285
0:9:33,55 --> 0:9:35,11
Squirting device.


286
0:9:35,11 --> 0:9:36,14
Straw dispenser.


287
0:9:36,14 --> 0:9:36,37
Bubble blower.


288
0:9:36,37 --> 0:9:37,275
Egg stand.


289
0:9:37,275 --> 0:9:38,16
Golf tee.


290
0:9:38,16 --> 0:9:39,155
Portable ant farm.

0:9:39,155 --> 0:9:40,99

Jenga.


294
0:9:42,51 --> 0:9:44,67
Portable black widow habitat.


295

Where's the spider?

Door stop.

0:9:50,5 --> 0:9:50,65

Mantle decorations.

Perfect muffin stand.

Tooth pick holder.

Table decoration.

307
0:9:59,1 --> 0:10:2,36
MALE SPEAKER: What am I supposed
to do with this?


308
0:10:2,36 --> 0:10:5,0
STEVE SPANGLER: Watch the
Spangler Effect to find out.


309
0:10:5,0 --> 0:10:7,54
Although we call it a
tornado, it's not.


310
0:10:7,54 --> 0:10:8,83
It's just a vortex.


311
0:10:8,83 --> 0:10:11,73
Tornado is actually when the hot
air rises, and a cold air


312
0:10:11,73 --> 0:10:12,87
front hits from the side.


313
0:10:12,87 --> 0:10:14,91
And you get these
swirling winds.


314
0:10:14,91 --> 0:10:17,25
Even though it's not a tornado,
everyone knows what


315
0:10:17,25 --> 0:10:18,69
you mean with these
swirling winds.


316
0:10:18,69 --> 0:10:21,39
And firefighters actually have
the same phenomenon.


317
0:10:21,39 --> 0:10:23,4
But they call them
fire tornadoes.


318
0:10:23,4 --> 0:10:24,56
You can imagine in
a forest fire how


319
0:10:24,56 --> 0:10:26,4
difficult that is to fight.


320
0:10:26,4 --> 0:10:29,7
But imagine a fire tornado
that's created and now spreads


321
0:10:29,7 --> 0:10:31,97
amongst the treetops, making
it super hard for


322
0:10:31,97 --> 0:10:33,47
firefighters to fight.


323
0:10:33,47 --> 0:10:35,57
We can recreate it here
using just some simple


324
0:10:35,57 --> 0:10:36,9
things around the house.


325
0:10:36,9 --> 0:10:38,17
Safety first.


326
0:10:38,17 --> 0:10:40,5
And you know not to
try this at home.


327
0:10:40,5 --> 0:10:42,43
Just watch the demonstration
here.


328
0:10:42,43 --> 0:10:43,8
This sponge and a little
bit of a lighter


329
0:10:43,8 --> 0:10:44,61
fluid goes on this.


330
0:10:44,61 --> 0:10:47,765
And this whole piece here
is a spinning table


331
0:10:47,765 --> 0:10:49,4
called a Lazy Susan.


332
0:10:49,4 --> 0:10:50,74
Now, watch what happens.


333
0:10:50,74 --> 0:10:53,68
If we were to light this on fire
and spin it, let's see if


334
0:10:53,68 --> 0:10:55,195
we can create a tornado
effect.


335
0:10:55,195 --> 0:10:59,35



336
0:10:59,35 --> 0:11:0,59
Hot air rises.


337
0:11:0,59 --> 0:11:1,66
We have a rotating flame.


338
0:11:1,66 --> 0:11:4,69
But it doesn't give us the
tornado that we really need.


339
0:11:4,69 --> 0:11:8,2
What we really need is to
simulate the winds hitting


340
0:11:8,2 --> 0:11:11,33
that rising hot air to
cause a spinning, or


341
0:11:11,33 --> 0:11:13,66
that centripetal force.


342
0:11:13,66 --> 0:11:16,87
Now, at a science museum, they
use a very large screen, for


343
0:11:16,87 --> 0:11:19,165
example, and a rotating table.


344
0:11:19,165 --> 0:11:21,63
Believe it or not, the solution
here is as simple as


345
0:11:21,63 --> 0:11:24,28
a mesh trash can.


346
0:11:24,28 --> 0:11:26,41
The fuel goes down in the
very center here.


347
0:11:26,41 --> 0:11:29,28
And now we just need to make
sure that it's spinning in the


348
0:11:29,28 --> 0:11:32,92
very, very center to
give us our vortex.


349
0:11:32,92 --> 0:11:34,17
That looks perfect.


350
0:11:34,17 --> 0:11:37,1



351
0:11:37,1 --> 0:11:40,32
You see, as it spins, it
catches that screen.


352
0:11:40,32 --> 0:11:43,7
And that screen now causes
that centripetal force.


353
0:11:43,7 --> 0:11:46,66
And you get this beautiful fire
vortex that shoots up


354
0:11:46,66 --> 0:11:48,39
just because of the rotation.


355
0:11:48,39 --> 0:11:51,6
Now you can see why this amazing
vortex of fire is so


356
0:11:51,6 --> 0:11:54,9
difficult for firefighters to
fight, because it literally


357
0:11:54,9 --> 0:11:58,45
can climb to the treetops,
causing a fire to spread very,


358
0:11:58,45 --> 0:12:2,4
very quickly because of
high, spinning winds


359
0:12:2,4 --> 0:12:3,51
and the fire tornado.


360
0:12:3,51 --> 0:12:5,27
With all this talk of
tornadoes, I do


361
0:12:5,27 --> 0:12:7,46
have one more question.


362
0:12:7,46 --> 0:12:8,285
Will it blend?
