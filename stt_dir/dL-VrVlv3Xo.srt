2
0:0:22,74 --> 0:0:25,64
CLAIRE TRIMER: Well, name is
Claire Trimer, and I'm a baby


3
0:0:25,64 --> 0:0:29,24
sloth wrangler at a sloth
sanctuary in Costa Rica.


4
0:0:29,24 --> 0:0:33,66
Well, we probably have about 135
sloths here, under a roof,


5
0:0:33,66 --> 0:0:35,44
that we're caring for.


6
0:0:35,44 --> 0:0:36,87
There's pretty much
sloths everywhere


7
0:0:36,87 --> 0:0:38,12
you look around here.


8
0:0:38,12 --> 0:0:41,14



9
0:0:41,14 --> 0:0:43,49
I have several roles here.


10
0:0:43,49 --> 0:0:47,58
One of them is to supervise
the babies.


11
0:0:47,58 --> 0:0:49,83
I weigh them every morning.


12
0:0:49,83 --> 0:0:52,516
I keep after the
health issues.


13
0:0:52,516 --> 0:0:53,8
Whoop.


14
0:0:53,8 --> 0:0:55,5
You went poo yesterday.


15
0:0:55,5 --> 0:0:58,32



16
0:0:58,32 --> 0:1:1,64
Sometimes their mothers die.


17
0:1:1,64 --> 0:1:4,65
And in that way they're
orphaned.


18
0:1:4,65 --> 0:1:9,88
Sometimes if a mother senses
that a baby is too weak to


19
0:1:9,88 --> 0:1:13,4
survive, or they actually have
some kind of problem that the


20
0:1:13,4 --> 0:1:16,66
mother has sensed, these babies
are not strong enough


21
0:1:16,66 --> 0:1:19,21
to cling, and they fall to
the ground repeatedly.


22
0:1:19,21 --> 0:1:23,83



23
0:1:23,83 --> 0:1:26,21
A mother sloth is vulnerable
every time she


24
0:1:26,21 --> 0:1:27,64
comes to the ground.


25
0:1:27,64 --> 0:1:31,3
And if she thinks that this
sloth is not going to survive,


26
0:1:31,3 --> 0:1:34,5
she's not going to keep coming
to the ground and risking her


27
0:1:34,5 --> 0:1:35,94
life over and over again.


28
0:1:35,94 --> 0:1:38,71



29
0:1:38,71 --> 0:1:40,23
KRISTA TITCHENER: I love sloths,
because it's been my


30
0:1:40,23 --> 0:1:42,36
favorite animal for
about 10 years.


31
0:1:42,36 --> 0:1:44,43
But I love their sweet
little face.


32
0:1:44,43 --> 0:1:45,89
They don't ever want
to hurt anybody.


33
0:1:45,89 --> 0:1:48,12
They just want to be happy
and be peaceful.


34
0:1:48,12 --> 0:1:51,87
And I just love their
sweet smile.


35
0:1:51,87 --> 0:1:54,43
My day as a volunteer involves
a lot of hard work.


36
0:1:54,43 --> 0:1:56,87
You know, your payoff for the
day is getting to interact


37
0:1:56,87 --> 0:1:59,37
with the sloths and play with
the sloths and maybe even hold


38
0:1:59,37 --> 0:2:2,53
this sloth's babies and
take them for walks.


39
0:2:2,53 --> 0:2:4,51
CLAIRE TRIMER: This is Alfy.


40
0:2:4,51 --> 0:2:6,71
He's actually a year old.


41
0:2:6,71 --> 0:2:10,415
We don't know why, but Alfy
never gained a lot of weight,


42
0:2:10,415 --> 0:2:15,352
and his fur is still the
texture of baby fur.


43
0:2:15,352 --> 0:2:29,11



44
0:2:29,11 --> 0:2:30,91
KRISTA TITCHENER: At 6:00 AM in
the morning, we clean out


45
0:2:30,91 --> 0:2:31,61
their cages.


46
0:2:31,61 --> 0:2:34,33
We really get to wake them up,
which is a great time for us.


47
0:2:34,33 --> 0:2:37,55
One of our favorites is Delilah,
and she will actually


48
0:2:37,55 --> 0:2:40,38
pull the towel back over her
head because he doesn't want


49
0:2:40,38 --> 0:2:41,34
to see you in the morning.


50
0:2:41,34 --> 0:2:42,59
She's way too tired.


51
0:2:42,59 --> 0:2:45,4



52
0:2:45,4 --> 0:2:47,2
Sid is our absolute favorite.


53
0:2:47,2 --> 0:2:50,23
My sister and I decided
to adopt Sid.


54
0:2:50,23 --> 0:2:52,18
KIM CATALA: Adopting him
does not mean that we


55
0:2:52,18 --> 0:2:52,95
can take him home.


56
0:2:52,95 --> 0:2:54,11
We wish we could.


57
0:2:54,11 --> 0:2:55,845
But we know we can't.


58
0:2:55,845 --> 0:2:58,52
So we just signed a little
certificate that we were


59
0:2:58,52 --> 0:2:59,45
adopting Sid.


60
0:2:59,45 --> 0:3:1,83
The money goes to the program.


61
0:3:1,83 --> 0:3:3,99
And then we'll write to him
and send him letters and


62
0:3:3,99 --> 0:3:5,54
everything.


63
0:3:5,54 --> 0:3:8,25
He'll like actually grab
you under your arms.


64
0:3:8,25 --> 0:3:10,76
Like he likes to
be slow-danced.


65
0:3:10,76 --> 0:3:12,26
Should we dance, Sid?


66
0:3:12,26 --> 0:3:20,99



67
0:3:20,99 --> 0:3:23,64
CLAIRE TRIMER: Occasionally,
someone says, how can you tell


68
0:3:23,64 --> 0:3:24,46
them apart?


69
0:3:24,46 --> 0:3:28,8
And I always want to go, how can
you not tell them apart?


70
0:3:28,8 --> 0:3:29,36
Yeah, you can tell them apart.


71
0:3:29,36 --> 0:3:31,35
You can tell your children
apart, so you can tell the


72
0:3:31,35 --> 0:3:32,93
baby sloths apart.


73
0:3:32,93 --> 0:3:33,12
Yeah.


74
0:3:33,12 --> 0:3:34,87
They're just a huge
part of my life.


75
0:3:34,87 --> 0:3:37,95
I'm with them almost
every single day.


76
0:3:37,95 --> 0:3:40,22
And they are sort of
like my children.


77
0:3:40,22 --> 0:5:40,22
