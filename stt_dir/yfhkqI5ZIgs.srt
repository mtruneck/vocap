1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:0,5



2
0:0:0,5 --> 0:0:1,72
RASHAD EVANS: You know, there's
not one fighter that


3
0:0:1,72 --> 0:0:2,85
fights exactly alike.


4
0:0:2,85 --> 0:0:5,1
Even though they may look like
it, they're still-- the


5
0:0:5,1 --> 0:0:7,62
expression is different, because
your personality


6
0:0:7,62 --> 0:0:9,3
comes out in it.


7
0:0:9,3 --> 0:0:12,74
A side of me comes out when I'm
competing, that in real


8
0:0:12,74 --> 0:0:15,38
life, I'm not like that.


9
0:0:15,38 --> 0:0:17,79
When I compete, I'm
cocky sometimes.


10
0:0:17,79 --> 0:0:19,24
I'm arrogant.


11
0:0:19,24 --> 0:0:21,67
But that's not for
the fans at home.


12
0:0:21,67 --> 0:0:23,29
That's for my opponent.


13
0:0:23,29 --> 0:0:24,92
I don't fight to prove
that I'm tough.


14
0:0:24,92 --> 0:0:28,49
I already know I'm tough.


15
0:0:28,49 --> 0:0:32,71
I fight because it's
inside of me.


16
0:0:32,71 --> 0:0:33,73
We all are fighters.


17
0:0:33,73 --> 0:0:37,75
Every single person who walks
this earth is a fighter.


18
0:0:37,75 --> 0:0:39,421
Everything that lives--


19
0:0:39,421 --> 0:0:43,89
to live is to fight,
and we just fight


20
0:0:43,89 --> 0:0:45,14
in different arenas.


21
0:0:45,14 --> 0:0:55,57



22
0:0:55,57 --> 0:0:55,782
Uh oh.


23
0:0:55,782 --> 0:0:58,5
It's in the water.


24
0:0:58,5 --> 0:1:2,4
He ain't jumping in the water,
I tell you that.


25
0:1:2,4 --> 0:1:2,515
You want the ball?


26
0:1:2,515 --> 0:1:2,99
Want the ball, huh?


27
0:1:2,99 --> 0:1:4,89
Go get it.


28
0:1:4,89 --> 0:1:8,35
Go get it, get it, get it.


29
0:1:8,35 --> 0:1:10,4
Man, you're slow.


30
0:1:10,4 --> 0:1:12,9
You're slow!


31
0:1:12,9 --> 0:1:13,83
I'm always afraid before
I compete.


32
0:1:13,83 --> 0:1:16,92
Before I fight, I'm
always afraid.


33
0:1:16,92 --> 0:1:19,7
I'm always like that.


34
0:1:19,7 --> 0:1:20,64
That feeling.


35
0:1:20,64 --> 0:1:25,32
And before, I used to have a
hard time just dealing with


36
0:1:25,32 --> 0:1:27,93
it, because I would try
to run away from it.


37
0:1:27,93 --> 0:1:31,72
But then as I competed more, I
understood the fact that this


38
0:1:31,72 --> 0:1:34,3
is how I'm supposed to feel.


39
0:1:34,3 --> 0:1:39,75
The biggest thing for me
whenever I compete, accept it.


40
0:1:39,75 --> 0:1:42,815
I used to have a sports--
like in GSP, we used to


41
0:1:42,815 --> 0:1:44,61
use the same one.


42
0:1:44,61 --> 0:1:48,51
And he used to have this drill
that we used to do.


43
0:1:48,51 --> 0:1:52,32
And we would stand in the mirror
and just say, I don't


44
0:1:52,32 --> 0:1:54,306
give a fuck.


45
0:1:54,306 --> 0:1:57,94
And just say that over and over
again, until you really


46
0:1:57,94 --> 0:2:1,36
start to really feel
it inside, like I


47
0:2:1,36 --> 0:2:2,25
don't give a fuck.


48
0:2:2,25 --> 0:2:5,26
And when you're saying that, you
really sound like, I don't


49
0:2:5,26 --> 0:2:7,132
give a fuck if I
get laughed at.


50
0:2:7,132 --> 0:2:9,12
I don't give a fuck if I get
knocked out in one second.


51
0:2:9,12 --> 0:2:13,68
I don't give a fuck if it's the
worst fight I've ever had.


52
0:2:13,68 --> 0:2:14,47
I don't give a fuck.


53
0:2:14,47 --> 0:2:17,27
And then once you start breaking
down all those


54
0:2:17,27 --> 0:2:19,7
things, all those feelings, all
those fears that you may


55
0:2:19,7 --> 0:2:22,77
have that becomes barriers, that
becomes the red lights,


56
0:2:22,77 --> 0:2:25,732
that becomes the thing that
keeps you from competing at


57
0:2:25,732 --> 0:2:29,2
your best, then you're
able to just free


58
0:2:29,2 --> 0:2:30,45
yourself and just go.


59
0:2:30,45 --> 0:2:34,59



60
0:2:34,59 --> 0:2:36,367
HENRI HOOFT: Rashad, everybody
knows Rashad, of course.


61
0:2:36,367 --> 0:2:37,82
He started this.


62
0:2:37,82 --> 0:2:38,82
Rashad is just--


63
0:2:38,82 --> 0:2:39,63
he's so funny.


64
0:2:39,63 --> 0:2:41,13
He's never really down.


65
0:2:41,13 --> 0:2:43,77
He's had a lot of stuff going
on in the last year, with a


66
0:2:43,77 --> 0:2:46,42
lot of personal stuff, but he
still always smiles, brings


67
0:2:46,42 --> 0:2:48,48
his good stuff, good
energy to the gym.


68
0:2:48,48 --> 0:2:49,98
Especially at this moment, when
he's right before the


69
0:2:49,98 --> 0:2:53,21
fight with [INAUDIBLE], he has
a good vibe, good energy.


70
0:2:53,21 --> 0:2:55,58
And Rashad's very good, you
know, in his role as one of


71
0:2:55,58 --> 0:2:58,2
the mentors of the gym and
one of the fighters.


72
0:2:58,2 --> 0:3:5,49



73
0:3:5,49 --> 0:3:8,92
RASHAD EVANS: Growing up, I
was, like, a crazy kid.


74
0:3:8,92 --> 0:3:11,92
Lot of energy, always wrestling,
always fighting.


75
0:3:11,92 --> 0:3:14,3
I grew up in Niagara
Falls, New York.


76
0:3:14,3 --> 0:3:15,37
It was fun there.


77
0:3:15,37 --> 0:3:17,2
You had the Falls there
and everything else.


78
0:3:17,2 --> 0:3:20,77
Growing up, I played football,
I wrestled, and I even ran


79
0:3:20,77 --> 0:3:21,62
track a little bit.


80
0:3:21,62 --> 0:3:24,846
But my last high school football
game, we were in the


81
0:3:24,846 --> 0:3:27,88
semis in the playoffs,
and my team lost.


82
0:3:27,88 --> 0:3:30,76
It kind of struck a chord in me,
because no matter how good


83
0:3:30,76 --> 0:3:34,29
of a game I had, I still
didn't win the game.


84
0:3:34,29 --> 0:3:36,67
And I didn't want to do it
anymore, because I was like,


85
0:3:36,67 --> 0:3:39,48
if I'm going to lose, I
want it to be on me.


86
0:3:39,48 --> 0:3:42,26
I want to be the one who's
holding the blame for losing.


87
0:3:42,26 --> 0:3:48,22
I don't want to doubt my
teammates or anything else


88
0:3:48,22 --> 0:3:50,996
like that, because they didn't
come through on their end.


89
0:3:50,996 --> 0:3:53,91
And I was like, you know, when I
lose, I want to lose for me.


90
0:3:53,91 --> 0:3:56,44
HENRI HOOFT: It's not normal
how strong he is, how fast.


91
0:3:56,44 --> 0:3:57,67
He already did very
good, of course.


92
0:3:57,67 --> 0:3:58,19
He was a champion.


93
0:3:58,19 --> 0:4:1,49
But we want to see him, like,
bang, like the old days.


94
0:4:1,49 --> 0:4:3,41
Just go out there and
just, don't care.


95
0:4:3,41 --> 0:4:3,84
Just go.


96
0:4:3,84 --> 0:4:5,298
Just do it.


97
0:4:5,298 --> 0:4:10,17



98
0:4:10,17 --> 0:4:12,49
RASHAD EVANS: The first time I
stepped into the cage, it was


99
0:4:12,49 --> 0:4:14,86
like a rush that I never
felt before.


100
0:4:14,86 --> 0:4:17,74
It was a different kind of
excitement, because it was


101
0:4:17,74 --> 0:4:20,55
married with fear, and it was
something I'd never had as a


102
0:4:20,55 --> 0:4:21,36
competitor before.


103
0:4:21,36 --> 0:4:24,885
Because even as a wrestler, no
matter how big the stage was,


104
0:4:24,885 --> 0:4:29,13
I still never had that
fear like you do


105
0:4:29,13 --> 0:4:30,22
when you have a fight.


106
0:4:30,22 --> 0:4:36,19
I found comfort in just playing
around and joking, and


107
0:4:36,19 --> 0:4:38,82
that helped me relax
a little more.


108
0:4:38,82 --> 0:4:42,334
But the first time I stepped in
the cage, it was like, wow,


109
0:4:42,334 --> 0:4:44,12
this is going down.


110
0:4:44,12 --> 0:4:45,55
HENRI HOOFT: Rashad is like
a character, man.


111
0:4:45,55 --> 0:4:48,2
I mean, you see him, he's
smiling, he's making fun.


112
0:4:48,2 --> 0:4:50,69
But Rashad, when he's
here, he works hard.


113
0:4:50,69 --> 0:4:52,81
He works hard, and he does what
he needs to do, you know?


114
0:4:52,81 --> 0:4:55,82
We like to train hard, and we
hit hard, but we still smile.


115
0:4:55,82 --> 0:4:57,45
You know, if you knock somebody
out, knock somebody


116
0:4:57,45 --> 0:4:59,92
down, have somebody in a choke,
you still smile after


117
0:4:59,92 --> 0:5:0,18
it, you know?


118
0:5:0,18 --> 0:5:0,63
You work together.


119
0:5:0,63 --> 0:5:2,61
And Rashad is just a
good guy with that.


120
0:5:2,61 --> 0:5:6,5
RASHAD EVANS: You know, I've
heard some people say, oh,


121
0:5:6,5 --> 0:5:7,8
he's made it.


122
0:5:7,8 --> 0:5:9,48
And whatever that means.


123
0:5:9,48 --> 0:5:11,63
But I understand the concept
behind what they're saying.


124
0:5:11,63 --> 0:5:13,98
What they're saying is
that he's known.


125
0:5:13,98 --> 0:5:15,1
He's been around in the game.


126
0:5:15,1 --> 0:5:16,56
He's been in the fight
game for a while.


127
0:5:16,56 --> 0:5:19,49
And being in the fight game
for a while is a feat in


128
0:5:19,49 --> 0:5:23,12
itself, especially seeing how
short a window fighters have.


129
0:5:23,12 --> 0:5:25,32
So a lot of guys, they
respect that, and


130
0:5:25,32 --> 0:5:26,32
they give me the respect.


131
0:5:26,32 --> 0:5:27,76
I am a student.


132
0:5:27,76 --> 0:5:31,31
I am a student of whoever
I can learn from.


133
0:5:31,31 --> 0:5:35,6
I don't see myself in a position
like, oh, I'm above


134
0:5:35,6 --> 0:5:39,3
anybody else, and I can never
learn, or no one can ever


135
0:5:39,3 --> 0:5:39,82
teach me anything.


136
0:5:39,82 --> 0:5:43,43
Because you learn a lot
from guys who are just


137
0:5:43,43 --> 0:5:45,3
starting off sometimes.


138
0:5:45,3 --> 0:5:47,76
And sometimes, when you've been
in the game for a long


139
0:5:47,76 --> 0:5:55,3
time, and you've seen a lot,
it's good to get a fresh sense


140
0:5:55,3 --> 0:5:58,78
of fresh energy from somebody,
because somebody may come in


141
0:5:58,78 --> 0:6:1,72
who hasn't been in the game for
a long time, who's just


142
0:6:1,72 --> 0:6:4,26
got an energy about them.


143
0:6:4,26 --> 0:6:7,54
That's one thing about John
Jones that I like most about


144
0:6:7,54 --> 0:6:8,49
training with him.


145
0:6:8,49 --> 0:6:11,14
He was my favorite training
partner to train with, because


146
0:6:11,14 --> 0:6:13,45
he helped me be more creative.


147
0:6:13,45 --> 0:6:18,48
Because when I was training with
him, he would always do


148
0:6:18,48 --> 0:6:20,64
something out of the box.


149
0:6:20,64 --> 0:6:23,1
And he didn't really
have any fear yet.


150
0:6:23,1 --> 0:6:25,83
He wasn't really afraid,
so he would just do


151
0:6:25,83 --> 0:6:26,62
whatever he would do.


152
0:6:26,62 --> 0:6:30,8
And it would work, because
people wouldn't expect it,


153
0:6:30,8 --> 0:6:31,89
because it's not typically
what you would do.


154
0:6:31,89 --> 0:6:34,35
But that's what made him great,
and that's why I liked


155
0:6:34,35 --> 0:6:36,92
training with him, because it
was like one of those things


156
0:6:36,92 --> 0:6:39,8
where you see somebody
with a fresh new look


157
0:6:39,8 --> 0:6:41,91
on things, you know?


158
0:6:41,91 --> 0:6:44,78
And that's what some of these
guys got coming in.


159
0:6:44,78 --> 0:6:48,53
They've got a fresh
look on things.


160
0:6:48,53 --> 0:6:50,67
HENRI HOOFT: People are only
going to talk with you when


161
0:6:50,67 --> 0:6:52,2
you're open for it.


162
0:6:52,2 --> 0:6:52,63
He's open.


163
0:6:52,63 --> 0:6:55,24
He talks with everybody about
everything, you know?


164
0:6:55,24 --> 0:6:57,43
Never comes into problems, never
has problems, never has


165
0:6:57,43 --> 0:6:58,6
problems with people here.


166
0:6:58,6 --> 0:6:59,82
He's a very cool guy.


167
0:6:59,82 --> 0:7:1,24
Very relaxed, laid down.


168
0:7:1,24 --> 0:7:3,4
Again, a good mentor
for young kids.


169
0:7:3,4 --> 0:7:3,77
They look up to him.


170
0:7:3,77 --> 0:7:5,81
But they don't really need to
look up to him, because he's


171
0:7:5,81 --> 0:7:7,85
here, training with them,
doing just normal.


172
0:7:7,85 --> 0:7:10,13
I mean, he has nothing to do
with stardom or something.


173
0:7:10,13 --> 0:7:11,47
He knows he's just a fighter.


174
0:7:11,47 --> 0:7:12,89
And I know from my
own experience--


175
0:7:12,89 --> 0:7:14,57
I mean, I was a champion,
too-- it takes


176
0:7:14,57 --> 0:7:15,66
a very short time.


177
0:7:15,66 --> 0:7:18,55
A long time to get there, but
a very short time to fall


178
0:7:18,55 --> 0:7:19,92
down, and nobody cares
about you anymore.


179
0:7:19,92 --> 0:7:20,87
And he sees that.


180
0:7:20,87 --> 0:7:22,12
He's just normal
with the guys.


181
0:7:22,12 --> 0:7:25,54
Doesn't really matter.


182
0:7:25,54 --> 0:7:27,42
RASHAD EVANS: To compete against
me is a mistake.


183
0:7:27,42 --> 0:7:30,27
He shouldn't be in a cage with
me, even though I may respect


184
0:7:30,27 --> 0:7:31,42
him immensely.


185
0:7:31,42 --> 0:7:34,77
And that's my mindset when I
compete, because for one


186
0:7:34,77 --> 0:7:37,93
second if I give him too much
respect, then he's already


187
0:7:37,93 --> 0:7:41,612
raising his leg on me, and
I can't be pissed on.


188
0:7:41,612 --> 0:7:42,74
I refuse.


189
0:7:42,74 --> 0:7:43,93
I piss on people.


190
0:7:43,93 --> 0:7:45,79
I don't get pissed on.


191
0:7:45,79 --> 0:7:47,56
And that's gotta
be my mindset.


192
0:7:47,56 --> 0:7:50,3
But that's different than
me in real life.


193
0:7:50,3 --> 0:7:51,4
In real life, I'm passive.


194
0:7:51,4 --> 0:7:52,52
I'm calm.


195
0:7:52,52 --> 0:7:55,69
I don't get upset a lot.


196
0:7:55,69 --> 0:7:56,61
I'm a nice person.


197
0:7:56,61 --> 0:7:59,22
But when I compete, it's
a different thing.


198
0:7:59,22 --> 0:8:0,77
It's a different expression.


199
0:8:0,77 --> 0:8:4,53
I always want to be around the
sport, rather than just being


200
0:8:4,53 --> 0:8:10,175
an MMA analyst, or rather
helping out guys on the team,


201
0:8:10,175 --> 0:8:12,3
I always want to be
part of the sport.


202
0:8:12,3 --> 0:8:15,32
This sport has done amazing
things for me.


203
0:8:15,32 --> 0:8:17,73
If I couldn't laugh, I couldn't
smile, if I couldn't


204
0:8:17,73 --> 0:8:20,81
have jokes with my friends,
then there'd


205
0:8:20,81 --> 0:8:20,78
be no sense of living.


206
0:8:20,78 --> 0:8:24,93
So for me, that makes
me enjoy life more.


207
0:8:24,93 --> 0:8:26,13
That makes me enjoy
practice more.


208
0:8:26,13 --> 0:8:29,4
That makes me enjoy this time
that we have with each other,


209
0:8:29,4 --> 0:8:31,65
because that's what
it's about, man.


210
0:8:31,65 --> 0:8:32,49
Life is celebration.


211
0:8:32,49 --> 0:8:34,47
The fact that I was able to
get up and train in the


212
0:8:34,47 --> 0:8:36,71
morning, and the fact that I
was able to train and sweat


213
0:8:36,71 --> 0:8:40,74
and be able to do this and get
this grind in with these guys,


214
0:8:40,74 --> 0:8:42,2
that's a blessing.


215
0:8:42,2 --> 0:8:43,87
That right there is
a celebration.


216
0:8:43,87 --> 0:8:45,86
One day, these will just be
memories that I have.


217
0:8:45,86 --> 0:8:49,54
And one day, I'll be too old
to do it, and I'm going to


218
0:8:49,54 --> 0:8:51,43
wish that I enjoyed it more.


219
0:8:51,43 --> 0:8:52,85
So I try to enjoy it as
much as possible.


220
0:8:52,85 --> 0:10:52,85
