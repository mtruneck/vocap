###5 THOMAS MORTON: Hi.
###5 It's Thomas.
###6 We're in Arizona at the Big Sandy Shoot Off.
###7 This guy's about to fire.
###8 [GUNFIRE]
###14 [LAUGHTER]
###15 That was fucking insane.
###17 
###24 Look out, and almost there.
###28 We are in an RV in the Sonora desert, in Arizona.
###31 We're headed to a place called Big Sandy, which is close to
###35 the Big Sandy Shoot Off, which is an annual event where
###38 people with guns get together and shoot their guns.
###40 Except their guns happen to be anti-aircraft guns, heavy
###43 artillery, those kind of RoboCop rifles that'll explode
###47 a Ford Pinto on one shot.
###48 
###54 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###57 Hooah.
###59 So that was comfy.
###62 We are parked right next to the gun line.
###66 Right now, the guys are out there setting up the targets.
###68 There are just, like, steel barrels, and then there's
###70 going to be model airplanes flying around
###71 for people to shoot.
###73 Then they have these things called reactive targets, which
###74 are basically just explosives that you shoot,
###76 and they blow up.
###78 So fun stuff.
###81 How long did it take you to find this place?
###83 KENTON: I got into my Jeep, and literally covered the
###86 whole state of Arizona.
###87 Took me five years.
###89 I saw a lot of really weird things, man.
###93 Hey, there.
###94 SHOOTER 1: Hi.
###94 KENTON: Everybody's setting up, and getting
###96 their sun shades up.
###98 Setting up their guns, setting up their tables.
###102 Gearing their ammo up.
###103 You'll find that their all real friendly.
###107 How's everyone today?
###108 SHOOTER 2: Excellent.
###108 KENTON: Let's start shootin'.
###110 ED : This is not a militia.
###112 Most of them are professional people.
###114 THOMAS MORTON: Yeah.
###115 So what you mean?
###115 Like, kind of like, doctors?
###117 ED : Doctors, and attorneys, and these people are real
###120 dedicated collectors and shooters.
###122 In order to own one of these guns, it's such a pain in the
###124 hind end, you gotta really want to do this.
###128 KENTON: Here's an anti-tank round that went through, and
###130 that's pretty good size.
###131 THOMAS MORTON: Yeah.
###132 KENTON: That's pretty sharp.
###133 Be careful.
###133 THOMAS MORTON: This would make a good picture.
###134 KENTON: This is hard steel.
###135 THOMAS MORTON: Yeah, this is very thick.
###136 KENTON: Very hard.
###138 THOMAS MORTON: That is a--
###138 KENTON: It's just a flesh wound [INAUDIBLE].
###139 THOMAS MORTON: --a bullet hole there.
###142 KENTON: We'll put Bob up here.
###143 We're blowin' Bob up, his ashes.
###145 THOMAS MORTON: He's just a friend?
###145 KENTON: Bob was an icon within the firearms community.
###148 I was in charge of taking care of him during his passing, and
###152 all his last 10 years.
###154 He is one who pushed us to form this range.
###156 And Bob's wish was to be blown up at the shoot,
###160 believe it or not.
###161 THOMAS MORTON: Yeah, no I-- yeah.
###162 KENTON: We're going to blow the crap out of him.
###163 That's what he wanted, you know?
###166 It's kind of a unique way.
###168 THOMAS MORTON: It's a fitting tribute, sounds like.
###169 KENTON: Yeah, we'd blow you up, man.
###170 If you're good.
###171 THOMAS MORTON: Let's.
###171 KENTON: We'll give you a few more [INAUDIBLE].
###173 THOMAS MORTON: Oh.
###174 
###180 Lot of really old-looking stuff--
###181 Gatling guns.
###183 Looks like water-cooled deals that would, like, just mow
###185 down infantrymen in World War I. It's an exciting array of
###190 death-dealers.
###191 You can murder a lot of people.
###195 SHOOTER 3: Browning 1919, just with the A-6 butt stock.
###198 That's probably my favorite.
###199 It's a reliable weapon.
###201 Rate of fire is slow, versus the anti-aircraft guns at
###205 1,200-1,300 rounds a minute.
###207 Still fun though.
###208 SHOOTER 4: So that basically it's a three-man operation.
###211 One guy shooting and one guy's loading.
###212 THOMAS MORTON: And feeding that.
###213 And you have two barrels on the other end?
###215 SHOOTER 4: Five barrels.
###216 Five barrels.
###217 THOMAS MORTON: So it's shooting--
###217 SHOOTER 4: [INAUDIBLE]
###218 THOMAS MORTON: Yeah.
###218 SHOOTER 4: Yeah, so it rotates.
###220 THOMAS MORTON: All right.
###222 So we're about getting ready for--
###224 the shoot is being started.
###225 Then everybody's going to start firing their guns for, I
###227 guess, five hours straight.
###229 So far everybody's super-friendly.
###230 Everybody's really psyched to explain their guns.
###233 A kind of a slight male skew to the crowd.
###234 I think I've seen about four women.
###236 But everybody's friendly.
###237 This is their week, and this is their time to come out here
###240 and expend all their energy through the firing of
###243 high-caliber bullets at model airplanes.
###247 Good clean fun.
###248 [APPLAUSE AND CHEERING]
###251 KENTON: Good morning.
###251 Good morning.
###253 All right.
###253 The schedule today.
###255 We're going to open up the line as soon as possible when
###257 we get done here.
###258 Targets are set.
###260 Then at 1 o'clock, we're going to go ahead
###262 and start it up again.
###264 That's when we blow Bob up.
###266 We're putting him in the dinosaur.
###268 We're also flying him in an airplane so he
###270 can watch over us.
###271 There's a plaque inside, and of course,
###274 when he passed away.
###275 Now, let's go shooting.
###277 [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]
###282 KENTON: Sixty seconds.
###283 Sixty seconds.
###285 
###289 [INAUDIBLE]
###291 [HORN SOUNDS]
###291 [MASSIVE GUNFIRE]
###307 [ARTILLERY FIRES]
###308 THOMAS MORTON: Jesus.
###309 [LAUGHS]
###311 There's all these explosions.
###311 There's reactive targets out there, which are basically
###314 literally just sticks of dynamite stuck on a post in
###317 the ground.
###317 And so sometimes you'll see pops where those go off, but
###320 there's other ones where it's just the caliber of the bullet
###322 hitting the hill.
###323 It's making, like, a firework level explosion.
###325 [MASSIVE GUNFIRE]
###333 I don't know how anybody can tell what they've hit.
###335 It's just, like, constant explosions and dust
###337 being kicked up.
###339 
###342 GUN RENTER: Fires from the open bolt.
###343 THOMAS MORTON: OK.
###344 GUN RENTER: OK.
###345 
###348 Mag in.
###350 You're ready to go.
###351 THOMAS MORTON: All right.
###351 That's it?
###353 This is a Thompson.
###354 GUN RENTER: Yes.
###355 THOMAS MORTON: The M-1 Thompson submachine gun.
###356 GUN RENTER: M-1 [INAUDIBLE]
###357 45 caliber.
###359 THOMAS MORTON: US Army's
###359 favorite, Al Capone's favorite.
###360 GUN RENTER: And when you--
###361 THOMAS MORTON: Eat lead, coppers.
###362 [AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE]
###365 Ah.
###367 
###369 Wow.
###370 GUN RENTER: Isn't that good?
###371 THOMAS MORTON: That's great.
###373 There's the last.
###374 I don't know how anybody ever did that.
###376 Be up in your face.
###379 It's a Finnish gun they used in the Winter War against the
###382 Soviet army, punch holes in tanks.
###385 It's probably going to punch a hole
###386 through my shoulder blade.
###389 This is a [INAUDIBLE].
###391 
###393 There?
###394 SHOOTER 5: OK.
###395 Get comfortable.
###396 It's going to go on your shoulder and your cheek is
###398 right there.
###399 THOMAS MORTON: Right there?
###399 OK.
###400 
###406 SHOOTER 5: Squeeze it hard at the bottom, and--
###408 [GUN CLICKS]
###408 --leave it squeezed at the bottom.
###410 Now pull the trigger.
###412 THOMAS MORTON: Fire in the hole.
###415 [ROUND GOES OFF]
###415 Whoa!
###416 [LAUGHS]
###420 Whoo-whee.
###422 Yeah.
###422 SHOOTER 5: How was that?
###423 All right?
###424 THOMAS MORTON: That felt good.
###425 There we go.
###426 That's just what busted the hole somewhere way off target
###429 from where I was.
###430 See if I've got-- oh, look.
###432 It literally blew my fucking earplug out from that side,
###435 That was insane.
###437 
###439 ED : Most people that have machine guns take them out to
###441 a cinder pit or a gravel pit and shoot them.
###444 But when you put them into a venue like this, it really
###446 shows you what these guns are capable of, which is pretty
###450 phenomenal.
###451 [JEEP STARTING UP]
###455 KENTON: I've known Bob since 1978, '77.
###458 THOMAS MORTON: Yeah.
###459 KENTON: I grew up with him.
###460 He was my second dad.
###462 He taught me all about automatic weapons, and
###464 firearms in general, actually.
###466 Never asked for anything.
###468 So, he had quite the honor code, you know?
###473 THOMAS MORTON: This is not quite the final resting place,
###475 but the delivery system.
###478 KENTON: Yeah.
###479 It's the delivery system.
###480 That's what we're doing.
###482 So Mike has prepared Bob in this bag, and we will
###487 literally blow him up.
###488 It's his wishes, and this is what he wanted done.
###491 You know, he wanted to be spread on this range.
###494 So everybody say goodbye to Bob.
###496 [EVERYONE TOGETHER]
###496 Good-bye, Bob.
###499 THOMAS MORTON: So, I think people are being a little bit
###500 coy with exactly what's in there, because when we asked
###503 for a breakdown of all the different component
###505 explosives, the list they gave us was a little shorter than
###508 the list they were talking about amongst themselves.
###510 A couple guys have openly mentioned the fact that this
###513 is, more or less, a dirty bomb in the shape of a papier-mache
###517 dinosaur filled with human ashes.
###520 So we're about to nuke Arizona right now
###522 with their old friend.
###525 KENTON: Just cough.
###527 Cough.
###528 No hurry here.
###530 [CHUCKLING]
###534 THOMAS MORTON: Shit.
###535 Here it comes.
###536 They're about to blow-up their friend Bob in a dinosaur.
###539 [HORN BLOWS]
###540 [MASSIVE GUNFIRE]
###545 [MODEL AIRPLANE ENGINE SCREAMS]
###546 
###560 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###574 What's kind of interesting about this is, this is sort of
###577 like an abstract thing.
###579 Like, there's no obvious political bent to it.
###582 It's not pushing law enforcement.
###584 NRA isn't here.
###585 It's just, like, pure firepower.
###588 It's just people who are, like, into guns
###590 for being into guns.
###593 Wolverines.
###594 
###596 Whoa.
###597 Yeah.
###598 That's going to make it hard to jack-off tonight.
###600 [LAUGHTER]
###606 KENTON: Other places don't have facilities or the ability
###609 to do anything near this, so everything is
###612 compared to this range.
###614 What this represents is the freedom to be able to shoot,
###617 to do what you want.
###618 But really, it's the camaraderie of
###620 all my fellow shooters.
###621 We help each other.
###622 It's a really good group of people.
###625 And frankly, I enjoy being around them.
###628 Shooter, stand by.
###630 Threat.
###630 [GUNFIRE]
###632 You did really, really well.
###633 THOMAS MORTON: Oh, thank you.
###634 KENTON: No, I thought you did.
###635 You're always welcome to come out and do that, you know?
###638 THOMAS MORTON: Well, thanks.
###638 Yeah.
###638 [INAUDIBLE]
###638 KENTON: We'll take you in.
###639 You'll be our, like, orphan child.
###640 [INAUDIBLE]
###641 [LAUGHTER]
###649 [MODEL AIRPLANE ENGINE DRONING]
###650 
###653 PILOT: We're setting up for the night shoot tonight.
###655 We'll just put glow sticks on them.
###657 It's my job to make sure I can get as much
###659 flying time as I can.
###661 It's just a matter of seeing if I can get a few passes in
###664 before someone hits it.
###667 THOMAS MORTON: So sun's finally set.
###668 It's getting towards full dark, which is the official
###671 start time for the night shoot.
###672 And, like, couple minutes from now, this thing's just going
###676 to be totally lit up with tracer fire, and explosions,
###680 and little glow stick planes flying around, and everybody
###682 trying to shoot them down.
###684 And it's been described as like the most insane fireworks
###686 display you've ever seen, but, like, on the ground, 20 yards
###691 away from you.
###693 Kind of, like, beats the shit out of, like, a laser show, or
###695 whatever you'd be doing.
###697 I assume they see a lot of laser shows here.
###699 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###706 [AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE]
###714 Whoa.
###716 Oh.
###718 To celebrate the end of the Big Sandy, we're going to
###720 shoot some [INAUDIBLE] tracers out of an old Nazi MP-40.
###724 [AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE]
###731 Here it comes in.
###732 
###737 KENTON: It's a very definite connection between firearms,
###741 and people, and growing up, and the Constitution, and the
###744 United States, and the freedom of this country.
###748 This is about the highest freedom you can do, I think.
###752 THOMAS MORTON: I mean, this is like the most complete sensory
###754 overload I think I've ever experienced.
###756 It reeks of sulfur.
###758 The sound of the gunfire is like it physically impacts
###761 your chest.
###761 You can feel the concussions.
###763 It's like completely short-circuiting your brain.
###767 I can't wait for the next plane to go up.
###770 [AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE]
###774 It's insane.
###775
