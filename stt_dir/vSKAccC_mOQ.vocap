###6 The hunt for planets beyond our solar system has reached a fever pitch.
###14 With some 500 planets revealed by ground telescopes, now, the ultimate planet finder, the Kepler
###22 space telescope, has released a tsunami of data.
###29 Among over a thousand new planet prospects are 200 multi-planet solar systems and 58
###36 worlds in life-friendly orbits.
###43 They're all within a narrow window on the sky the size of your hand. That's why this
###50 may be the tip of the iceberg in a galaxy that's literally crawling with planets.
###59 Scientists are now beginning to envision what these worlds are like, with atmospheres, oceans,
###73 geological history.
###77 In the process, they are redefining what a planet might need to spawn life.
###98 On a clear night, far from city lights, you can see around 2000 stars with your eyes.
###105 That's a tiny fraction of all there are in the galaxy at large.
###111 And yet, even with the largest telescopes, most stars appear only as points of light,
###117 bright dots that offer few clues to one of our most searching questions...
###126 Are there other worlds like ours, or are we bound to a lonely oasis, Earth, amid a barren
###138 universe?
###139 So far, in this age of planet hunting, we've yet to find anything like our solar system.
###148 Instead, astronomers have glimpsed a diverse planetary zoo, with giant planets in wide
###156 orbits around their parent stars, others that swing in so close they leave a comet-like
###160 tail, or molten rocky worlds emblazoned with oceans of lava.
###171 These finds have added new complexity to theories of how solar systems emerge in the birth of
###179 a star.
###181 As dust and gas swirl into the newborn star, they form a proto-planetary disk.
###193 Within this Frisbee-like structure, gravity sculpts planetary bodies that grow in size,
###200 sweeping up smaller bodies that form around them.
###205 Current theory holds that giant planets, forming on the periphery, commonly migrate into the
###214 inner solar system. This confirms the observation of so-called hot Jupiters orbiting perilously
###224 close to their parent stars.
###227 But these giants may clear out smaller rocky planets that form close to the star, creating
###233 a planetary desert... just where you'd hope to find life.
###241 Does that make the search for another Earth a wild goose chase? To find out, a group of
###249 planet hunters, using the Keck Telescope in Hawaii, examined a sample of 166 sun-like
###256 stars within 80 light years of Earth.
###260 Over a five-year period, they looked for tiny wobbles in the stars' light that might betray
###266 the gravitational tug of planets.
###268 Their conclusion: only one or two stars in a hundred have a Jupiter-sized planet.
###276 Six have a planet the size of Neptune.
###281 To their surprise, twelve have large rocky worlds called super Earths. This means that
###290 as many as a quarter of all sun-like stars should have planets roughly the size of Earth.
###297 Now enter the Kepler Space Telescope, launched in March 2009 on a mission to find Earth-like
###306 planets.
###308 Astronomers aimed its camera into the Milky Way's Orion arm at a region covering just
###315 .4% of the sky.
###320 Kepler's sensitive detectors are designed to pick up slight dips in a star's brightness,
###325 the possible signature of a planet passing in front.
###331 Over a four-month period in 2009, it observed the light of over 150,000 stars, within 3000
###339 light years of Earth. The data showed that at least in one case, the planetary desert
###346 is not so barren.
###350 The star Kepler 11 is a yellow dwarf similar to our sun. It has at least five planets close
###358 enough to be inside the orbit of our Mercury, with a sixth inside the orbit of Venus.
###363 There may well be additional planets further out. That won't be known until 2012, when
###372 data from longer orbits is complete.
###378 Overall, Kepler turned up 58 planets in the so-called habitable zone. Most are large gas
###384 planets, but who's to say that some of them don't have moons with liquid water?
###392 Think Pandora.
###397 With a growing planetary database, astronomers are beginning to redefine what it takes to
###402 spawn life as we know it.
###407 Ideally, astronomers will one day stumble upon a world about the size of Earth, with
###413 oceans, an atmosphere, a moon to stabilize its orbit, a robust magnetic field to shelter
###424 it from solar winds, and creatures beaming television shows into space that reveal their
###429 presence.
###446 Until then, the most fertile ground for finding life turns out to be a long-overlooked class
###452 of stars.
###453 M Stars, or red dwarfs, range from one half to one-twentieth the mass of our sun and make
###463 up 76% of all the stars in our galaxy.
###469 The most famous is in the southern constellation of Libra, just 20 light years away, called
###475 Gliese 581.
###476 A team of French and Swiss astronomers had been studying its light from a telescope in
###482 the mountains of Chile.
###485 They noticed a slight jitter: the gravitational tugging of planets.
###491 From this so-called radial velocity, they deduced the presence of Gliese 581B, a planet
###498 with sixteen times the mass of Earth. At a distance of only six million kilometers, it's
###505 bound to be very hot.
###508 Then came planet C, with an orbit of 11 million kilometers. Still too hot.
###516 Then there's D, at about 33 million kilometers from its sun.
###522 At the outer edge of the star's habitable zone, it receives only 30% of the light that
###529 Earth gets from our Sun.
###533 Compare it to Mars, where surface temperatures average around -59 degrees Celsius.
###542 Astronomers suspect that Planet D is an icy world that migrated in from the outer solar
###548 system.
###551 It's too extreme to be of interest to SETI, the Search for Extra Terrestrial intelligence.
###560 But not to a group called Active SETI.
###563 Hoping to hasten contact, the social networking site Bebo, in collaboration with a Russian
###569 radio astronomer, used a dish in Ukraine to beam 500 text messages to Gliese 581.
###578 Another group used the Deep Space Communication Complex at Tidbinbilla, Australia to beam
###584 25,000 messages. It's not interstellar spam.
###590 "Think big," said the messages, "We come in peace," and "Dare to dream."
###598 It'll take 20 years to get there, and 20 more to find out if the aliens hit the "like" button.
###604 Or if they need help.
###611 Red dwarfs are known as "Flare Stars" for the violent eruptions that take place on their
###616 surfaces.
###619 In 1985, the red dwarf AD Leo erupted with a thousand times more power than the worst
###627 solar eruptions.
###631 To find out what that would do to a planet in a close orbit, scientists simulated the
###636 blast.
###638 They found that ultraviolet radiation from the star would split oxygen molecules in the
###644 planet's atmosphere, forming ozone. That could be enough to shield it from harm.
###651 Studies like this are prompting scientists to redefine just what they mean by "habitable
###660 zone."
###662 It's the old Goldilocks story.
###666 Some bears go for a walk to let their porridge cool. Then a girl comes along. One is too
###674 hot. Two is too cold. Three is just right.
###680 When the bears finally return, Goldilocks hops out the window and runs away.
###688 Is that a metaphor for Contact?
###692 We now know it's not just our distance from the sun that makes Earth habitable.
###699 Venus is about 41 million kilometers closer to the Sun, but because of its thick cloud
###704 cover, 30% less solar energy reaches its surface.
###709 And yet, surface temperatures spike at 495 degrees Celsius. The reason is that the planet's
###718 thick, dense atmosphere is composed of 90% carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that traps
###725 heat.
###728 There's something else at work on our planet.
###730 When sunlight bounces off the earth, water vapor and cloud droplets absorb some of the
###737 energy in the infrared portion of the spectrum, transferring it to the rest of the atmosphere.
###745 You can see it in this satellite image showing outgoing heat. The most heat escapes from
###750 the tropics, where the surface is warmer and there are fewer clouds.
###758 And yet, a recent NASA study predicted that if water vapor were the only greenhouse gas,
###764 temperatures would fall, sending Earth into an icebound state.
###772 Something is needed to act as a thermostat, a control knob, to keep the climate steady.
###778 Though it's only .038% of the atmosphere, carbon dioxide absorbs enough energy to prop
###787 up global temperatures and allow water to remain in the atmosphere.
###793 But the Earth did not come gift wrapped with this balance of CO2.
###805 In its early days, the Earth would have released enormous amounts of heat from its core. That
###813 drove the eruption of volcanoes and the release of huge volumes of CO2 and other chemicals.
###827 In time, some CO2 was removed by chemical reactions between silicate rocks and water,
###833 a process called weathering, and washed into the sea.
###839 Another crucial factor came into play.
###843 Down at the margins of hydrothermal vents, organic molecules gave rise to primitive life
###848 forms known as prokaryotes.
###853 Other primitive forms evolved with the ability to take in carbon dioxide and emit oxygen
###860 in the process of photosynthesis.
###865 The ability to cycle carbon in and out of the atmosphere is perhaps the highest bar
###870 that an alien planet must reach to be called earth-like.
###877 So far, the closest we've come to that is a planet called Gliese 581G.
###882 Though its presence is in dispute, the initial read says it's three to four times the mass
###889 of Earth, and located squarely in its star's habitable zone based on temperature.
###896 Has Nature crafted a life-bearing gem in this distant solar system?
###904 Because Gliese 581 is so dim, its habitable zone is well inside the orbit of our Mercury.
###911 If there is a planet there, the star's gravity is bound to lock it in place.
###917 This means that Planet G does not rotate. One side always faces the sun.
###927 In our universe, the rate something spins, or doesn't spin, is often imprinted at birth.
###934 Our Milky Way, for example, arose in the early days of our universe, when gravity drew countless
###940 small galaxies together. The galaxy's spin was determined by the direction and the masses
###947 of all the stars and gas that crashed into it.
###953 At the center of the galaxy is a supermassive black hole that rotates once every 17 minutes,
###963 based on the timing of flares on its event horizon.
###968 The spin record for a neutron star is 1,122 times per second, based on the timing of radio
###979 emissions.
###980 It's like a skater, twirling on the ice. As she draws her arms in, she spins faster.
###989 Most planets in our solar system spin in a counter clockwise manner, if you're looking
###993 down on their north poles.
###996 The exceptions are Uranus, with a reverse spin every 17 hours.
###1001 And Venus, once every 243 earth days.
###1010 One way to imagine a locked planet is to take away Earth's rotation.
###1016 The planet weighs six billion, trillion tons and spins at just over a thousand miles per
###1022 hour at the equator.
###1024 To stop it would take no less than a planetary collision, of the kind that probably knocked
###1031 Uranus and Venus off kilter.
###1041 When the dust settled, you'd find a whole new world.
###1056 If you're on the side facing the sun, its position in the sky never changes.
###1062 Without the day night cycle, Earth would loose the unevenness of solar heating that helps
###1067 drive oceanic and atmospheric circulation.
###1071 The traditional thinking was that any water on a locked planet would fall out as snow
###1076 on the dark side and be trapped forever.
###1078 That thinking changed in the late 1990s when NASA scientists simulated the atmosphere of
###1086 a locked planet. They found that global wind patterns could develop and transport heat
###1092 to the dark side.
###1095 Scientists at the California Institute of Technology sought to test this finding by
###1100 turning off Earth's rotation in a supercomputer program normally used to predict our climate.
###1108 The team placed the sub solar point, the region facing the sun, just off the coast of South
###1113 America.
###1114 This side view shows the new setup. Evaporation on the sunny side sends air rising up in storms,
###1123 and pushing over the poles to the dark side.
###1126 As a result of this pole-ward flow, Alaska would experience summer all year round.
###1134 Landmasses on the dark side, including Europe, Asia and Africa, would go cold. Remarkably,
###1142 over the five decades of the simulation, the oceans retain enough heat to stay clear of
###1147 ice.
###1147 On the light side, large parts of the western hemisphere dry out, turning to desert.
###1156 But if you pitch your tent at the sub solar point, you'd find a hot and rainy climate
###1164 that resembles this place... the island of Kauai in Hawaii.
###1171 Its highest point is Mount Waialeale. That's Hawaiian for Rippling or Overflowing Water.
###1178 Known as the rainiest place on Earth, the summit averages 11 meters of rain per year.
###1186 How would a place like this adapt to sunlight all the time?
###1196 Plants depend on light to drive photosynthesis, a process that combines CO2 with water to
###1202 produce sugars needed for growth.
###1204 They use the day night cycle to maximize this process, to tune their growth rates, and take
###1213 in more carbon dioxide.
###1217 But in polar regions, some plants are known to thrive in periods of extended sunlight
###1222 in summer.
###1224 So if you take away the night, the chances are that life could adapt.
###1230 But its ability to do so draws upon hundreds of millions of years of evolution, in a diverse
###1236 global biosphere, dependable day night cycles, and moderate temperatures.
###1243 The question is whether complex plant and animal life could evolve in the first place
###1248 on a locked planet.
###1249 Gliese 581G is already a marginal candidate for life. With its dark and light sides averaged
###1260 together, surface temperatures are between -12 and -31 degrees Celsius.
###1266 A team from the University of Chicago sought to investigate its life-bearing chances, assuming
###1274 abundant water and carbon dioxide.
###1276 Here's the most promising scenario, called "Eyeball Earth."
###1284 Open ocean at the sub-solar point is surrounded by ice. The key is to keep the ice at bay,
###1291 because it can stifle the exchange of heat between water and air.
###1298 What could tip the balance is the presence of land... a high amount of weathering at
###1302 the sub-solar point could draw too much CO2 from the atmosphere, and turn the planet into
###1308 an iceball.
###1309 An explorer from a distant Earth would no doubt head for the transition zone between
###1318 ice and open water.
###1321 If there's land there, life might have a chance to thrive in open coastal habitats and perhaps
###1327 move from sea to land.
###1332 Gliese581G, and other locked planets, are surely nothing like Earth. And yet time is
###1341 on their side.
###1344 Our sun was born 5 billion years ago and it will start to fade in a few billion more.
###1352 On the other hand, Red Dwarf stars can burn steadily for tens, even hundreds of billions
###1358 of years.
###1361 So with a bit of luck, planet G may have its day in the sun, if it can spawn primitive
###1368 life and somehow shelter its evolution into more complex forms.
###1372 Will we ever find worlds in advanced stages of development? With the discovery that our
###1382 galaxy is likely filled with planets, we are sure to intensify our search.
###1388 One day we may well record a telling chemical signature or even receive some kind of text
###1396 message.
###1396 For some on this planet, the news will no doubt pass overhead... in the headlong rush
###1406 of technology, crisis, war, consuming, and escape.
###1416 For others, that day will be filled with humility and wonder in the knowledge that our world
###1426 is not alone.
