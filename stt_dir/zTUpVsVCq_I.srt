1
0:0:2,56 --> 0:0:5,46
shuttle going to uh...


2
0:0:5,46 --> 0:0:9,489
who are going to have on to do some
post-debate analysis


3
0:0:9,489 --> 0:0:14,99
and uh... had no idea is until uh... we
heard uh... this clip


4
0:0:14,99 --> 0:0:17,4
from uh... mit romney this clip number
one


5
0:0:17,4 --> 0:0:19,6
and i said well gosh cant wait


6
0:0:19,6 --> 0:0:22,199
kelly find some some women that are also
qualified


7
0:0:22,199 --> 0:0:26,81
and uh... and sweet we took a concerted
effort to go out and find a women


8
0:0:26,81 --> 0:0:29,84
who had backgrounds that could be
qualified to become members of our


9
0:0:29,84 --> 0:0:30,789
cabinet


10
0:0:30,789 --> 0:0:33,62
i went to a number of women's groups and
said can you help us find folks i


11
0:0:33,62 --> 0:0:38,0
brought us or a binders full of the of
women i was proud of the fact that after


12
0:0:38,0 --> 0:0:41,32
i staffed by cabinet and my senior staff


13
0:0:41,32 --> 0:0:46,24
at the university orca in albany did a
survey of all fifty states


14
0:0:46,24 --> 0:0:49,66
and concluded that mine had more women
and seniors leadership positions than


15
0:0:49,66 --> 0:0:51,55
any of the state america


16
0:0:51,55 --> 0:0:54,6
now one of the reasons i was able to get
somebody good women to be part of that


17
0:0:54,6 --> 0:0:58,8
team was because of our recruiting f yes
it was their recording efforts and so i


18
0:0:58,8 --> 0:1:0,62
said to uh...


19
0:1:0,62 --> 0:1:4,309
matt binder who is our uh... one of our
producers


20
0:1:4,309 --> 0:1:6,369
ringleader binder


21
0:1:6,369 --> 0:1:11,47
and uh... so we're gonna have digby on
today but it turns out


22
0:1:11,47 --> 0:1:13,74
that this story


23
0:1:13,74 --> 0:1:16,49
allowed uh... mit romney


24
0:1:16,49 --> 0:1:18,24
not exactly true


25
0:1:18,24 --> 0:1:22,12
i'm just so shocked i don't even know on
even though the say


26
0:1:22,12 --> 0:1:23,12
my


27
0:1:23,12 --> 0:1:24,62
uh...


28
0:1:24,62 --> 0:1:28,79
it turns out that you know mit romney
didn't turn to is


29
0:1:28,79 --> 0:1:33,87
his pals once he got an opposite break
binder love women


30
0:1:33,87 --> 0:1:38,5
so that i may hire more women no in fact


31
0:1:38,5 --> 0:1:42,49
according to david bernstein riding in
the uh... phoenix


32
0:1:42,49 --> 0:1:45,42
what actually happened was that in two
thousand two prior to the election not


33
0:1:45,42 --> 0:1:49,4
even know yet whether would-be
republican or democratic administration


34
0:1:49,4 --> 0:1:51,83
a bipartisan group of women in
massachusetts


35
0:1:51,83 --> 0:1:55,19
formed a mask at to address the problem
a few women and senior leadership


36
0:1:55,19 --> 0:1:58,25
positions in state government


37
0:1:58,25 --> 0:2:0,36
they created the binder


38
0:2:0,36 --> 0:2:2,45
and handed it


39
0:2:2,45 --> 0:2:5,3
to the incoming governor at the time


40
0:2:5,3 --> 0:2:10,109
sorrow maybe a slight distinction small
fed by mit romney


41
0:2:10,109 --> 0:2:12,12
of course according to burstein


42
0:2:12,12 --> 0:2:16,65
uh... he did appoint fourteen women out
of his first thirty three senior level


43
0:2:16,65 --> 0:2:22,719
appointments but they were all in
agencies you didn't care about


44
0:2:22,719 --> 0:2:24,51
and it also raises the question


45
0:2:24,51 --> 0:2:28,6
how is it that guy who had been working
in business for twenty five years in


46
0:2:28,6 --> 0:2:29,829
senior management


47
0:2:29,829 --> 0:2:30,999
balancing budgets


48
0:2:30,999 --> 0:2:33,29
doing all the negro league


49
0:2:33,29 --> 0:2:35,709
saving the olympics


50
0:2:35,709 --> 0:2:39,829
never came across one woman he thought
was qualified to serve in his


51
0:2:39,829 --> 0:2:41,979
administration


52
0:2:41,979 --> 0:2:43,659
they've got


53
0:2:43,659 --> 0:2:46,689
abundant


54
0:2:46,689 --> 0:2:51,59
also throughout his administration if
there was a decline a a progressive


55
0:2:51,59 --> 0:2:54,359
decline throughout his administration a
woman working under yasir ended up being


56
0:2:54,359 --> 0:2:58,939
less women uh... than than than at the
beginning but


57
0:2:58,939 --> 0:3:1,349
let's not get the picking


58
0:3:1,349 --> 0:5:1,349
sometimes the binders are not uh... you
they just the binders don't show up
