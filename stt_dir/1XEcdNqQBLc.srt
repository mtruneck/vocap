CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: Fridays may be awesome,
but we are asking about a different day of


2
0:0:4,72 --> 0:0:8,84
the week in today`s "Shoutout." A lot of ground
to cover before we get there, though, so let`s


3
0:0:8,84 --> 0:0:24,15
go ahead and get started.


4
0:0:24,15 --> 0:0:29,55
An alleged plot to blow up the Federal Reserve
Bank of New York, that`s where we start today.


5
0:0:29,55 --> 0:0:33,699
Federal authorities say, they`ve broken it
up and arrested the suspect as part of an


6
0:0:33,699 --> 0:0:39,1
undercover investigation. The Federal Reserve
is the central bank of the United States.


7
0:0:39,1 --> 0:0:43,199
This one in New York is a regional branch
of it. Officials say the suspect was planning


8
0:0:43,199 --> 0:0:49,14
to set off an explosion there with what he
thought was a 1000 pound bomb. No, it wasn`t


9
0:0:49,14 --> 0:0:55,21
real. The false explosives came from an undercover
agent. Quazi Nafis is 21 years old. He`s from


10
0:0:55,21 --> 0:1:0,469
Bangladesh, came to the U.S. on a student
visa. But prosecutors say, his real goal was


11
0:1:0,469 --> 0:1:4,96
to carry out a terrorist attack. He was arrested
after he tried to set off the device.


12
0:1:4,96 --> 0:1:10,7
There are a lot of ways to pay for college.
Scholarships, financial aid, savings, working


13
0:1:10,7 --> 0:1:16,57
through it. Another option is student loans.
Now, those have to be repaid, and a new report


14
0:1:16,57 --> 0:1:21,619
says today`s college seniors are graduating
with more student loan debt, more money that


15
0:1:21,619 --> 0:1:24,57
has to be repaid than ever before.


16
0:1:24,57 --> 0:1:29,11
This report says, the two thirds of the class
of 2011 had student loan debt, and the average


17
0:1:29,11 --> 0:1:35,31
borrower owed nearly $27,000. Part of this
depends on what school you go to. At the colleges


18
0:1:35,31 --> 0:1:41,539
this study looked at, the low into the average
debt per graduate was 3,000, the high end,


19
0:1:41,539 --> 0:1:46,789
more than 55,000. A couple of explanations
were offered for the debt increase from previous


20
0:1:46,789 --> 0:1:52,34
years. One is rising tuition prices, the other
is the tough job market for college graduates


21
0:1:52,34 --> 0:1:53,759
looking for work.

23
0:1:56,179 --> 0:2:1,95
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What`s the word? The
amount by which spending exceeds income.


24
0:2:1,95 --> 0:2:7,84
Deficit. That`s the word.


25
0:2:7,84 --> 0:2:12,25
(END VIDEO CLIP)


26
0:2:12,25 --> 0:2:17,43
AZUZ: Right now, the U.S. government is running
a deficit, it has been for years, it`s the


27
0:2:17,43 --> 0:2:21,87
topic that comes up a lot in politics, and
as you might expect, it`s come up a lot in


28
0:2:21,87 --> 0:2:26,319
this year`s presidential campaign. In fact,
during this week`s debate, between Barack


29
0:2:26,319 --> 0:2:32,4
Obama and Mitt Romney, the word deficit came
up nearly 20 times. Both candidates have plans


30
0:2:32,4 --> 0:2:35,69
for how to do with it, Tom Foreman compares
their ideas.


31
0:2:35,69 --> 0:2:35,45
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


32
0:2:35,45 --> 0:2:38,47
TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Both candidates
have made it a cornerstone of this election


33
0:2:38,47 --> 0:2:43,43
to talk about the deficit, the difference
between how much money our government is spending


34
0:2:43,43 --> 0:2:50,659
and how much it is taking in in taxes. This
is the deficit right now, $1,090,000,000,00.


35
0:2:50,659 --> 0:2:53,97
If we all wanted to pay it off, every man,
woman and child in the country would have


36
0:2:53,97 --> 0:3:0,97
to kick in about $3500. That`s a lot, and
yet each candidate says confidently, I can


37
0:3:0,97 --> 0:3:5,379
reduce the deficit. How would they do that?
Well, first, let`s talk about what they agree


38
0:3:5,379 --> 0:3:5,629
on.


39
0:3:5,629 --> 0:3:9,439
They all say that we`re going to have to contain
the spending of the government and control


40
0:3:9,439 --> 0:3:13,23
it, but we`re also going to have to rewrite
the tax code, and we have to get the economy


41
0:3:13,23 --> 0:3:17,569
moving again, because that`s what going to
produce money and revenue, and really solve


42
0:3:17,569 --> 0:3:20,3
the problem, but beyond that, they don`t agree
on much.


43
0:3:20,3 --> 0:3:25,17
Let`s look at the Romney plan first. If these
were to represent everything he wants to spend


44
0:3:25,17 --> 0:3:29,78
money on, and he needs this much to cover
it, he knows he`s not going to get it, because


45
0:3:29,78 --> 0:3:34,579
he has a deficit. So, how is he going to deal
with that deficit? He says he is going to


46
0:3:34,579 --> 0:3:40,42
do it with tax cuts. Now, tax cuts initially
are going to make the deficit worse, so he


47
0:3:40,42 --> 0:3:45,409
needs to offset them. He says he is going
to do that by looking at deductions and loopholes,


48
0:3:45,409 --> 0:3:50,299
things that people use to avoid paying taxes.
Says, he won`t go after things like the mortgage


49
0:3:50,299 --> 0:3:54,86
deduction, or the health care deduction, things
that many middle class people rely on, at


50
0:3:54,86 --> 0:3:58,89
least he suggests he won`t go after those,
but that`s the problem. Economists say, if


51
0:3:58,89 --> 0:4:2,969
you grab up all the other deductions that
you might put on wealthier people and you


52
0:4:2,969 --> 0:4:8,39
put them all back in this pile, it`s not going
to be enough, you are going to end up eventually


53
0:4:8,39 --> 0:4:13,629
having to tax the middle class or watching
the deficit just get bigger, at least based


54
0:4:13,629 --> 0:4:15,489
on the plan as I know it right now.


55
0:4:15,489 --> 0:4:19,519
Barack Obama, he has different version of
the same song. He`s got all the things he


56
0:4:19,519 --> 0:4:23,639
wants to pay for, he also will not have all
the money he needs for it. He is going to


57
0:4:23,639 --> 0:4:29,46
have a deficit, too, and he says you can deal
with it by taxing the wealthy. This is a popular


58
0:4:29,46 --> 0:4:34,19
plan with many voters, but it also has a fundamental
flaw. There are just not that many wealthy


59
0:4:34,19 --> 0:4:39,12
people in the country. If you define wealthy
as being people who individually make more


60
0:4:39,12 --> 0:4:44,88
than $200,000 a year, as he often does, for
every one there is like that in the country,


61
0:4:44,88 --> 0:4:49,419
this is how many there are who don`t make
that much money. You would have to tax these


62
0:4:49,419 --> 0:4:53,949
person at a much higher rate than the White
House is talking about to solve this problem,


63
0:4:53,949 --> 0:4:59,889
and even then you probably wouldn`t get enough
money to really make up the deficit. The simple


64
0:4:59,889 --> 0:5:6,39
truth is, both of these plans are woefully
short on important details to tell us if they


65
0:5:6,39 --> 0:5:8,46
would really reduce the deficit.

0:5:8,46 --> 0:5:8,84

67
0:5:8,84 --> 0:5:13,569
PELLEY: All right, discussing politics with
your friends, that can be kind of tricky,


68
0:5:13,569 --> 0:5:17,4
especially if you don`t agree on every issue.
It could lead to some arguments, it could


69
0:5:17,4 --> 0:5:24,539
lead to some hurt feelings, but doing it online?
That could lead to some downright unfriendingness.


70
0:5:24,539 --> 0:5:28,639
Karin Caifa takes a look at how this year`s
presidential election is effecting some people`s


71
0:5:28,639 --> 0:5:30,569
friends and followers on social media.


72
0:5:30,569 --> 0:5:31,389
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


73
0:5:31,389 --> 0:5:35,91
KARIN CAIFA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: While the
candidates have squared off here and here


74
0:5:35,91 --> 0:5:39,55
and here, another intense debate has played
out here.


75
0:5:39,55 --> 0:5:42,319
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: When you get a chance
to watch debates, you can kind of just go


76
0:5:42,319 --> 0:5:44,11
on Facebook and figure out exactly what happened.


77
0:5:44,11 --> 0:5:48,6
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If we go back and forth,
I don`t know, I mean there are statuses in


78
0:5:48,6 --> 0:5:49,69
mind, we do, we do that a lot.


79
0:5:49,69 --> 0:5:54,199
CAIFA: Social media traffic during the major
political events has exploded during the 2012


80
0:5:54,199 --> 0:5:59,949
campaign season, and soak in emotions as Facebook
and Twitter feeds get jammed with more political


81
0:5:59,949 --> 0:6:1,99
statements than ever.


82
0:6:1,99 --> 0:6:6,699
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: There are some times
entertaining, I just usually ignore them most


83
0:6:6,699 --> 0:6:7,479
of the time.


84
0:6:7,479 --> 0:6:12,39
CAIFA: Some time it`s too much to ignore.
A survey from the Pew Research Center earlier


85
0:6:12,39 --> 0:6:17,849
this year found roughly one in five social
media users has cut someone off for a political


86
0:6:17,849 --> 0:6:18,949
post that went too far.


87
0:6:18,949 --> 0:6:22,8
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He got personal, I said,
no, no. You are out! You are out!


88
0:6:22,8 --> 0:6:28,56
CAIFA: But for every post that makes you want
to hit delete, think about this, Kelly Fincham,


89
0:6:28,56 --> 0:6:33,63
assistant professor at Hofstra University,
says that not having any debate among connections


90
0:6:33,63 --> 0:6:35,259
may not be good either.


91
0:6:35,259 --> 0:6:44,62
KELLY FINCHAM, HOFSTRA UNIVERSITY: It does
act a little bit like an echo chain. You are


92
0:6:44,62 --> 0:6:46,919
usually following people who they are already
your friends. It`s harder to hear other opinions.


93
0:6:46,919 --> 0:6:48,449
So it`s harder to seek out alternative opinions
and voices.


94
0:6:48,449 --> 0:6:52,449
CAIFA: Users can always hide updates from
friends or followers during big political


95
0:6:52,449 --> 0:6:59,18
events, or until the electoral overload stops
after November 6th. In Hempstead, New York,


96
0:6:59,18 --> 0:6:59,919
I`m Karin Caifa.

98
0:7:0,379 --> 0:7:5,41
AZUZ: So, this brings up an interesting question,
would you un-friend someone for making political


99
0:7:5,41 --> 0:7:9,3
statements you didn`t agree with? Would you
just hide their posts or would you just ignore


100
0:7:9,3 --> 0:7:13,259
it. We are asking on our blog today, if you
head to CNN STUDENT NEWS.COM you can tell


101
0:7:13,259 --> 0:7:20,8
us what you think, but only if you use your
first name, no last initials, no classes.


102
0:7:20,8 --> 0:7:23,259
If you`ve never been in a plane and flown
over a landmark, the captain might get on


103
0:7:23,259 --> 0:7:27,15
the speaker and draw your attention to it.
It`s kind of what happened on an Air Canada


104
0:7:27,15 --> 0:7:32,44
flight this week. The plane was almost at
the end of a 14-hour flight to Australia when


105
0:7:32,44 --> 0:7:38,36
the captain dropped down from 37,000 feet
to 4,000 feet. Then he asked people to peek


106
0:7:38,36 --> 0:7:43,599
out the window and see if they could find
something. This yacht, it was stranded out


107
0:7:43,599 --> 0:7:48,97
on the water, no fuel, broken mast, the sailor
set off an emergency signal. Officials asked


108
0:7:48,97 --> 0:7:53,83
the Air Canada flight if it could help out,
and the people onboard did. Passengers and


109
0:7:53,83 --> 0:7:59,389
crew spotted him, authorities eventually arrived
to pick up the sailor. Total time from when


110
0:7:59,389 --> 0:8:3,55
he set off the signal to when he was spotted
by the plane, 25 minutes.

114
0:8:13,65 --> 0:8:19,75
The U.S. presidential election is traditionally
held on what day of the week? Here we go,


115
0:8:19,75 --> 0:8:28,97
is it Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday or Saturday.
You`ve got three seconds, go!


116
0:8:28,97 --> 0:8:37,61
The presidential election is held on the Tuesday

AZUZ: Tuesday is also when new video games
are traditionally released. The new "Halo"


120
0:8:46,1 --> 0:8:51,29
comes out on Tuesday, November 6. That date,
the day of U.S. presidential election.


121
0:8:51,29 --> 0:8:56,0
This was the kind of line that formed when
"Halo 3" came out in 2007, people going to


122
0:8:56,0 --> 0:9:0,28
stores for midnight release parties. Some
folks are wondering if this year`s release


123
0:9:0,28 --> 0:9:4,92
could impact the election. One point of view
says people who are motivated to vote, are


124
0:9:4,92 --> 0:9:9,84
going to vote. Another says, people might
skip voting to dive into the new game. What


125
0:9:9,84 --> 0:9:13,46
do you say? If you are already on Facebook,
talk to us at Facebook.com/cnnstudentnews.


126
0:9:13,46 --> 0:9:20,64
And finally, that old cliche about being sent
to bed without your dinner? I think this is


127
0:9:20,64 --> 0:9:25,61
the exact opposite. These twins are so totally
tuckered out, they are slipping in their sleep,


128
0:9:25,61 --> 0:9:30,4
as they slurp up spaghetti. The one on the
left gave in pretty quickly, the one on the


129
0:9:30,4 --> 0:9:35,68
right keeps chewing, even as he nods off.
Youtube video is great, and it`s understandable:


130
0:9:35,68 --> 0:9:40,9
you`ve got kids who are obviously ready for
bed. Even with the temptation of delicious


131
0:9:40,9 --> 0:9:45,29
spaghetti, you can`t expect them to stay awake
pasta certain point. All right. How do we


132
0:9:45,29 --> 0:9:48,42
come up with brilliant puns like that one?
You just got to use your noodle. That eats


133
0:9:48,42 --> 0:11:48,42
up our time for the day. Have a great weekend,
and we`ll see you on Monday.
