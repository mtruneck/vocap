###33 attachment to the budget bill that had to pass a budget though overall
###37 but this attachment the need to be a narrow all it wasn't saying that my
###41 central it and other cultural companies
###43 are protected from certain types of lawsuits
###46 now that's outrageous why would they need to be protected if the did
###49 something wrong they should go to court like everybody else in the fatten them
###52 selves
###52 too for the congress to supersede the courts and say no no
###56 this is a company that's above the law is absolutely outrageous course though
###60 bombing administration did not object to it and the democrats uh... are the ones
###64 that uh... also
###66 put it you know through while barbara mikulski who runs that
###69 committee in the senate is a democrat allowed to go forward

###151 his wife works for craft
###153 craft was also part of a
###155 trying to defeat california probs this thirty-seven
###158 which would've label g_m_ os monsanto also added to that effort
###163 four borders will be married to corporate interest in this case
###166 uh... but you don't have to go that far you're so that is num where yeses money
