###2 EDDIE HUANG: Nah man, for real, this 64
###4 and breezy out here.
###7 It's that sweatshirt up top, shorts on the bottom, some of
###11 them Nike Dri-FIT socks, keep your feets warm.
###16 It's kind of the perfect weather to hold
###18 a city down, man.
###20 I can't wait to fuck some bitches in sweatpants.
###23 On that.
###25 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###26 
###43 EDDIE HUANG: What's up ya'll?
###44 Today I'm fresh off the boat.
###45 I'ma take you to the mission for three of my favorite
###46 burritos, then hop over to Daly City, get a fresh cut,
###50 and eat some Filipino food.
###51 Which while I find delicious, is still looking for its
###53 Captain Kirk to translate it to the American palate.
###56 Can a brother get some tortillas?
###57 
###60 Yo, so Daly City, this Pinoy town, huh Jules?
###63 JULIUS ARRIOLA: Yes sir.
###64 They like to call this place Lil' Manila, man.
###67 No shit.
###68 EDDIE HUANG: Why did that happen?
###69 Is it just like mad hospitals here?
###72 I saw the Jollibee coming in.
###73 JULIUS ARRIOLA: Oh, there you go.
###74 EDDIE HUANG: So ya'll got to be here.
###77 I feel like Filipino food just gets disrespect, like not
###79 enough people talk about it.
###81 Why do you think that is?
###82 CHAD GABRIEL: I think just the way it looks.
###83 It's not really appetizing by the sight.
###86 It looks like already chewed up food.
###88 And people get the misconception that it probably
###91 tastes nasty.
###91 EDDIE HUANG: I feel like a lot of it's packaging.
###93 Because Americans will bring people to a sushi lunch,
###97 business lunch.
###98 I doubt many people are like, yo let's go get these seasick
###101 power lunch.
###102 You know what I'm saying?
###103 Them motherfuckers.
###106 [GUITAR PLAYING]
###110 EDDIE HUANG: All right, Farolito burrito, tong.
###114 [GUITAR PLAYING]
###116 
###122 EDDIE HUANG: The things that really drive
###123 you crazy are nuance.
###124 And in Chinese we call this "shinway", where it's like a
###127 flavor that's not too heavy, not to light, just there.
###130 And it's just enough that you want more, and you're not
###134 satisfied, and you keep coming back.
###135 That is the goal of every chef cooking something, is that he
###138 wants to make you a dish you never want to stop eating.
###141 That's what fucking burrito is.
###143 Where my burrito man at?
###147 Thanks, dude.
###149 Yo, Diddy got the umbrella carrier , I got the burrito
###151 carrier, son.
###152 [INAUDIBLE] got Spliff Star to carry his weed.
###155 I got someone carry my burritos, kid.
###157 All right?
###157 G shit.
###159 [LAUGHTER]
###161 [PIANO MUSIC]
###164 JULIUS ARRIOLA: Even going back to being a barber, and
###167 Filipino barbers, and Filipino barber shops in general.
###170 In recent times, I feel like we're able to build a
###173 foundation of acceptance of being a Filipino barber, and
###177 being in a Filipino owned and ran barbershop.
###180 Before people used to be like, ah, man Filipinos can get down
###182 with fades and line-ups?
###184 I don't think so, man.
###186 Over time we were able to prove ourselves.
###189 Jealous Guys, San Francisco.
###190 Ayinde, right here.
###192 Casa.
###192 Eddie.
###193 EDDIE HUANG: Hey, nice to meet you.
###193 Are you the one with that duck tail?
###194 JULIUS ARRIOLA: Oh yeah, that San Francisco duck tail, man.
###197 AYINDE: Yeah, my shit fucked up right now, though.
###199 EDDIE HUANG: Yeah, that's fine.
###200 Wolfy?
###202 Oh, damn.
###204 So how did that start though?
###206 AYINDE: The Fillmore niggas, in San Francisco.
###207 
###210 Filmore was like the Harlem of the West.
###211 They was always on the fashionable shit.
###213 They got all the bitches, in that
###215 neighborhood in San Francisco.
###216 So they started wearing the tails.
###218 And it was either the box or the shag
###220 going all the way across.
###222 So once it got popular, everybody in San Francisco
###225 started doing it.
###226 So when you go to Oakland, Richmond, Vallejo, [INAUDIBLE]
###228 everybody neighbor in San Francisco.
###230 EDDIE HUANG: I mean I had a rat tail when I was a kid, but
###233 that's totally different.
###234 That's like black's man mullet.
###235 AYINDE: It Yeah, that's what it is.
###236 That's all it is.
###237 EDDIE HUANG: That is the black man's waterfall.
###239 Sure, he got the strap kid.
###241 Eh.
###242 Eh.
###244 So you all are a group?
###245 AYINDE: Yeah, we The Jealous Guys.
###247 EDDIE HUANG: I never heard anyone claiming to be the
###249 haters, though.
###249 AYINDE: It's how you do it.
###250 Know what I'm saying?
###250 Because music don't got too much emotion in it no more.
###253 EDDIE HUANG: There is some emotion.
###254 Vale is an emotional man.
###255 That is an emotional man.
###258 He was just talking about Lotus flowers and bullshit.
###261 AYINDE: Oh, that shit?
###262 We fuck with Lotus flowers, though.
###264 That's pussy, right?
###265 We fuck with Lotus flowers.
###266 EDDIE HUANG: I hope so.
###266 AYINDE: That's also what the duck tail is for.
###270 When she want to grab the back of the tail.
###272 She can't handle it, because the tongue too deep.
###274 Nigga, know what I'm saying, use the tail.
###276 Know what I'm talking about?
###278 [MEXICAN MUSIC]
###280 
###288 EDDIE HUANG: Oh, Carne Asada at Taqueria.
###291 Alright?
###293 
###295 In comparison with the other burritos, this
###296 one is a little smaller.
###297 It's a little tighter, and I like that.
###300 There's not rice in here.
###301 I would prefer a little bit of rice.
###303 Rice provided a nice texture.
###305 In here, the flavor of the protein overpowers the
###307 avocado, the tomato, the beans.
###310 They do everything well.
###311 I just kind of wish there was some rice, a little more
###314 toothsome tortilla, but very good.
###317 We out.
###318 
###322 [MEXICAN GUITAR]
###324 
###340 EDDIE HUANG: That is?
###340 I don't want the sauce on it.
###341 I want the foil burrito.
###344 They just dying to give me this Mexican sushi with the
###347 bukaki accoutrements on top.
###350 No bueno, kid.
###352 [MEXICAN GUITAR]
###357 EDDIE HUANG: I like these because it's got the tortoise
###358 light and then the gold.
###360 Oh, it's like your shit.
###361 Yeah, son.
###361 We kind of doing the same thing.
###363 JULIUS ARRIOLA: Yeah, tortoise with the gold.
###363 EDDIE HUANG: Oh yeah, twin.
###365 What's good twin?
###367 Oh yeah, so this your spot?
###369 JULIUS ARRIOLA: Yeah, man.
###369 Pampanga's Cuisine, they call it, man.
###372 EDDIE HUANG: I smell it, man.
###373 I smell the grilled pork.
###374 Oh man, what do they got here?
###376 Hi, how are you?
###377 Good.
###379 JULIUS ARRIOLA: So they got a whole bunch of
###379 stuff, today, man.
###381 EDDIE HUANG: What's that?
###382 
###388 Beans?
###388 What's in the beans?
###389 
###393 What vegetable?
###394 
###399 If we don't tell Americans what's in
###401 there they gonna bug.
###402 You know what I mean?
###402 They need to know.
###403 Come on.
###404 Let's make it sound delicious to them.
###406 All right?
###406 What's this?
###407 
###410 Menudo.
###411 Pork and what else?
###413 Just pork?
###414 I see potatoes.
###415 I see carrots.
###416 What's in the sauce?
###419 Tomato sauce.
###421 We gotta make this sound more appetizing, god.
###424 You got to give me more.
###425 Come on.
###426 You're not selling your food properly.
###428 
###430 All right.
###431 JULIUS ARRIOLA: Awesome, man.
###433 EDDIE HUANG: Yeah, man.
###433 This is a Filipino feast, man.
###436 JULIUS ARRIOLA: The Sisig has been a
###437 craze out here, recently.
###438 The Senior Sisig that's the food truck.
###440 They've done Filipino-Taqueria fusion.
###444 Instead of carne asada, they put in Sisig as replacement.
###447 And it's been a hit, man.
###448 EDDIE HUANG: I'm down with people
###449 taking my Filipino food.
###451 You know what, I think people will be more receptive to it
###454 if it's in a taco, or if it's in a bow.
###459 If that's what has to happen for people to actually start
###462 to experience our food.
###463 That's great, but that is kind of sad part that people won't
###467 just eat our food as is.
###468 Do you know what I mean?
###469 But then on the converse, my mom and my grandparents, they
###473 weren't the most receptive to other cultures' food.
###475 So it's not intrinsic to America either.
###477 I think our generation, it's is our job to break the
###480 barriers and get people outside their comfort zone.
###485 Finally, after multiple tries, the Taqueria Cancun burrito.
###491 Even in this state, a burrito palate fatigue.
###494 I'd eat two of these joints.
###495 Nice tortilla.
###497 There's a little bit of even flakiness to this tortilla,
###499 because it was on the griddle.
###500 I think that this carnitas can't be topped.
###503 This is one of the best carnitas I've ever had.
###505 I liked Farolito the best, but all three of them had
###507 something different.
###508 Taqueria had a very nice size, very easy, it was an unwieldy.
###514 This one, I think, might have the best protein.
###517 It's tender and delicious, very moist, packs a punch.
###521 But overall, as a package, I think El Farolito.
###524 Just enough, man.
###525 It's a very balanced hand that they're
###528 cooking with over there.
###529 To me that's hands down, numero uno.
###531 Alright?
###532 Just so you know, you got a lot of spots on the camera.
###535 CAMERAMAN: Yeah, I know.
###535 I can't even see it.
###536 [SLAP SOUND]
###538 EDDIE HUANG: You know what's funny?
###539 In New York we'd shit on something in a mini mall.
###542 We'd shit on being next to the Karaoke Depot, or the
###548 laundromat, and the dental.
###549 I mean, this doesn't look like some ill, [INAUDIBLE]
###553 OG culture.
###554 It's not something that New Yorkers would bug over, but
###557 you start to realize there's some real shit here.
###561 It looks different.
###563 The symptoms of culture that you should be up on are
###567 different in Cali than they are in New York.
###569 So it's fun to kind of discover the new language,
###572 where I can't just roll by a mini-mart and assume it's
###575 going to suck.
###577 But San Francisco, I got to say man, it's got a lot of the
###581 things that I love about the city.
###582 There's a lot niche culture.
###585 There's a lot of alternative things going on.
###588 But they know how to relax out here.
###590 It's definitely something that I need to learn how to do.
###593 So, we fresh off the boat and we out motherfucker.
###597
