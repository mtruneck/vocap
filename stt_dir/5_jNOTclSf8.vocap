###16 SNOOP DOGG: What up, dog?
###17 My name is big Snoop, D-O double G. And this is the
###21 craziest story I can remember from way back in the day.
###25 I remember going to a party at the Playboy mansion.
###27 I had on a blue smoker's jacket, Playboy mansion, boo,
###32 and had a big ol' pimp cup, real big, about a half a
###37 gallon of champagne, a gallon of orange juice-- you know
###39 what I'm saying?-- to level it off, walking
###42 around, me and Bishop.
###44 And one of the bunnies says, Snoop, can I have
###46 some of your drink?
###47 I say, yeah.
###47 Go ahead, baby.
###48 So she grabbed it and took a sip.
###51 Gave it to her friend and let her have a sip.
###53 And they passed it around.
###54 And I turned my head and turned back around.
###58 They gave me my glass.
###59 I started drinking.
###60 And as I'm drinking, boom, I'm starting to
###63 feel a little different.
###65 So I start to walk and get a little queasy.
###68 And there's nowhere to sit.
###69 So I finally find some room or a door.
###72 And I kick through the door.
###74 And when I go through the door, it's like
###76 16 flights of steps.
###78 And I fall down all of the steps straight to the bottom,
###81 to the floor.
###82 Boom.
###83 With a couple of white girls running down the stairs.
###87 They start pouring water on my neck.
###89 And I heard Bishop Magic Juan say, the church is down.
###92 Call the ambulance.
###93 The church is down.
###95 So the girls get me to a point where I
###97 finally, like, wake up.
###99 And they like, someone slipped a roofie on you.
###101 So I get back and walk back through the party.
###104 I'm like, you know what?
###106 I can't leave the party like this.
###107 And now I start smoking weed with everybody.
###111 And I go into this little grotto.
###113 And there's a couple of Playboy bunnies in there.
###116 And I says, my dick is on the line right now.
###118 I gave the bunnies more than they can handle.
###121 I gave 'em a treat.
###122 And it wasn't no carrot stick.
###125 It was a pogo stick, if you dig what I mean.
###129 Up and down it go.
###130 It was official like a referee with a whistle.
###133 A star was born.
