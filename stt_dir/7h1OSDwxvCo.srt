1
0:0:11,327 --> 0:0:13,407
<i>You slept with your best friend!</i>


2
0:0:13,407 --> 0:0:16,727
<i>This will be a disaster</i>
<i>unless you say the right thing</i>


3
0:0:16,727 --> 0:0:18,807
<i>so choose your words carefully,</i>


4
0:0:18,807 --> 0:0:25,207
Great job last night, buddy.


5
0:0:25,207 --> 0:0:31,327
Good thing you came along.
l've been on four since med school.


6
0:0:31,327 --> 0:0:38,167
Damn it.


7
0:0:38,167 --> 0:0:40,927
We shouldn't feel weird about this.


8
0:0:40,927 --> 0:0:44,87
- Things like this happen all the time.
- All the time!


9
0:0:44,87 --> 0:0:46,327
- lt's not a big deal.
- it's not a big deal.


10
0:0:46,327 --> 0:0:48,967
Stop repeating
what l say in that weird tone.


11
0:0:48,967 --> 0:0:54,7
- No more repeating.
- What happened last night was


12
0:0:54,7 --> 0:0:56,87
a wonderful mistake.


13
0:0:56,87 --> 0:1:0,847
And it's probably best
if we just go back to the way things were.


14
0:1:0,847 --> 0:1:5,807
l totally agree.


15
0:1:5,807 --> 0:1:8,487
l'm gonna see you tomorrow.


16
0:1:8,487 --> 0:1:10,967
Tomorrow.


17
0:1:10,967 --> 0:1:14,87
<i>Elliot's amazing</i>
<i>and you're crazy about her,</i>


18
0:1:14,87 --> 0:1:16,727
<i>If you let her leave</i>
<i>I'm gonna do this all day:</i>


19
0:1:16,727 --> 0:1:20,767
<i>I get knocked down but I get up again</i>
<i>You're never gonna keep me down</i>


20
0:1:20,767 --> 0:1:22,207
<i>I get knocked down,,,</i>


21
0:1:22,207 --> 0:1:26,487
Wait, Elliot...


22
0:1:26,487 --> 0:1:32,7
l just...


23
0:1:32,7 --> 0:1:34,567
Just say it.
Say, ''Elliot, stay in bed


24
0:1:34,567 --> 0:1:37,607
and have sex with me
until neither of us can move.''


25
0:1:37,607 --> 0:1:40,367
Let's do that.


26
0:1:40,367 --> 0:1:44,607
l cannot believe
you almost let me leave.


27
0:1:44,607 --> 0:1:47,487
You're gonna pay for that.


28
0:1:47,487 --> 0:1:50,807
l'm good for that.


29
0:1:50,807 --> 0:2:11,167
l got to...


30
0:2:11,167 --> 0:2:14,927
We are really good at having sex.
We should take this show on the road.


31
0:2:14,927 --> 0:2:17,207
My mom would sit in the front row


32
0:2:17,207 --> 0:2:20,127
and tell me l'd look prettier
if l smiled more.


33
0:2:20,127 --> 0:2:22,967
You don't really smile.
You just make this face.


34
0:2:22,967 --> 0:2:27,407
You looked surprised that
you were actually having sex.


35
0:2:27,407 --> 0:2:30,167
l was. l mean, four times?


36
0:2:30,167 --> 0:2:32,247
Give it up.


37
0:2:32,247 --> 0:2:36,127
- l think l already did.
- You did.


38
0:2:36,127 --> 0:2:38,327
How weird was that this morning?


39
0:2:38,327 --> 0:2:42,167
Have you ever been more
uncomfortable in your entire life?


40
0:2:42,167 --> 0:2:44,247
<i>You look hot in that dress,</i>


41
0:2:44,247 --> 0:2:46,327
What movie are we watching?


42
0:2:46,327 --> 0:2:49,47
lt's <i>Basic Instinct</i> Grandma.


43
0:2:49,47 --> 0:2:51,807
Yeah, once.
But all this sex?


44
0:2:51,807 --> 0:2:55,567
lt just soothes my soul.


45
0:2:55,567 --> 0:2:57,487
And l really like your nose.


46
0:2:57,487 --> 0:2:59,647
How did that last time even start?


47
0:2:59,647 --> 0:3:1,887
l just know l went to the door


48
0:3:1,887 --> 0:3:6,447
and when l came back, you said
l looked sexy holding a pizza.


49
0:3:6,447 --> 0:3:9,407
You did.


50
0:3:9,407 --> 0:3:11,487
For safety reasons, l should go.


51
0:3:11,487 --> 0:3:13,807
You're not going anywhere.


52
0:3:13,807 --> 0:3:20,887
You gotta help me eat this pizza.


53
0:3:20,887 --> 0:3:22,807
Good.


54
0:3:22,807 --> 0:3:26,407
See now, you even look sexy
holding that slice.


55
0:3:26,407 --> 0:3:36,87
- l do, don't l?
- You do.


56
0:3:36,87 --> 0:3:38,807
l was not. You were.


57
0:3:38,807 --> 0:3:42,7
Sometimes l like
a little sugar in my coffee.


58
0:3:42,7 --> 0:3:46,87
l just think it's best
if we keep this between us for now.


59
0:3:46,87 --> 0:3:48,767
lt's hard enough
without everybody talking.


60
0:3:48,767 --> 0:3:52,727
But it'll help people.
Like those two, for instance.


61
0:3:52,727 --> 0:3:59,487
They've been dancing around
each other for months now.


62
0:3:59,487 --> 0:4:2,927
l'm not afraid
to show people here how l feel about you.


63
0:4:2,927 --> 0:4:6,367
You just want the guys
to know you're getting some.


64
0:4:6,367 --> 0:4:8,447
Not just the guys.


65
0:4:8,447 --> 0:4:10,447
Good morning, Dr Cox!


66
0:4:10,447 --> 0:4:12,567
We are short-staffed today


67
0:4:12,567 --> 0:4:15,847
because Kelso has volunteered
all of you scut monkeys


68
0:4:15,847 --> 0:4:18,367
for some psychologist's research project,


69
0:4:18,367 --> 0:4:21,567
which means
you won't be helping patients.


70
0:4:21,567 --> 0:4:24,647
lnstead, you'll be
blabbering about your feelings,


71
0:4:24,647 --> 0:4:27,127
and what it's like
working in the hospital,


72
0:4:27,127 --> 0:4:30,847
and how that affects
your personal lives and...


73
0:4:30,847 --> 0:4:36,247
And there he is now,
big Bob-o himself.


74
0:4:36,247 --> 0:4:38,887
All nurses and interns,
let's gather round


75
0:4:38,887 --> 0:4:41,167
and dance for the puppet master.


76
0:4:41,167 --> 0:4:42,967
Dance!


77
0:4:42,967 --> 0:4:46,167
lt's not just the nurses and interns.


78
0:4:46,167 --> 0:4:48,887
Don't be that guy, Bob.


79
0:4:48,887 --> 0:4:51,607
l guess l became a doctor because


80
0:4:51,607 --> 0:4:55,87
ever since l was a little boy,
l just wanted to help people.


81
0:4:55,87 --> 0:4:57,727
l don't tell this story very often,


82
0:4:57,727 --> 0:5:0,327
but l remember
when l was seven years old,


83
0:5:0,327 --> 0:5:3,247
l found a bird
that had fallen out of its nest.


84
0:5:3,247 --> 0:5:5,727
So, l picked him up
and l brought him home,


85
0:5:5,727 --> 0:5:8,927
and l made him a house
out of an empty shoebox, and...


86
0:5:8,927 --> 0:5:13,87
My God!


87
0:5:13,87 --> 0:5:16,647
l became a doctor for the same
four reasons everybody does:


88
0:5:16,647 --> 0:5:18,967
Chicks, money, power and chicks.


89
0:5:18,967 --> 0:5:21,927
But since HMOs have
made it virtually impossible


90
0:5:21,927 --> 0:5:25,207
to make any real money,
which affects the number of chicks


91
0:5:25,207 --> 0:5:28,927
who come sniffing around, and don't
ask what tree they're barking up,


92
0:5:28,927 --> 0:5:32,887
cos they're sure not pissing on mine.
And as far as power goes, well...


93
0:5:32,887 --> 0:5:36,247
Here l am during my free time
letting some 1 3-year-old


94
0:5:36,247 --> 0:5:40,847
psychology fellow ask me questions
about my personal life.


95
0:5:40,847 --> 0:5:44,167
So here's the inside scoop.


96
0:5:44,167 --> 0:5:48,607
Why don't you go ahead
and tell me all about power?


97
0:5:48,607 --> 0:5:50,687
Check her out.


98
0:5:50,687 --> 0:5:53,207
- Dude, HFFA.
- Excuse me?


99
0:5:53,207 --> 0:5:57,407
HFFA? ''Hot from far away''
but up close she's nasty.


100
0:5:57,407 --> 0:6:3,167
That is so messed up.


101
0:6:3,167 --> 0:6:7,287
l am sorry l made an insensitive
statement about an ugly person.


102
0:6:7,287 --> 0:6:9,287
l'm taking one of those moments


103
0:6:9,287 --> 0:6:12,687
where l weigh your good qualities
against your bad ones


104
0:6:12,687 --> 0:6:16,527
and decide
if you're actually worth the trouble.


105
0:6:16,527 --> 0:6:19,487
You made it. That was close.


106
0:6:19,487 --> 0:6:22,87
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.


107
0:6:22,87 --> 0:6:24,647
Elliot's looking for a surgical consult.


108
0:6:24,647 --> 0:6:28,567
- Do you know where she is?
- Why should l know?


109
0:6:28,567 --> 0:6:33,207
l know where the Todd
would like Elliot to be. ln his pants.


110
0:6:33,207 --> 0:6:34,647
Clever.


111
0:6:34,647 --> 0:6:38,287
She's not going out with anyone.
You should ask her out.


112
0:6:38,287 --> 0:6:41,7
Elliot and the Todd?
That's a terrible couple.


113
0:6:41,7 --> 0:6:44,487
- Worse than Joanie and Chachi.
- Joanie loves Chachi.


114
0:6:44,487 --> 0:6:46,407
The Todd is asking Elliot out.


115
0:6:46,407 --> 0:6:49,367
- l think she'd be lucky to ride my...
- Please.


116
0:6:49,367 --> 0:6:50,927
...motorcycle.


117
0:6:50,927 --> 0:6:54,327
Gotcha.


118
0:6:54,327 --> 0:6:57,927
God bless him.


119
0:6:57,927 --> 0:7:1,7
When l was seven,
the only things that l loved


120
0:7:1,7 --> 0:7:3,847
were my ColecoVision...
and Sandy Lowe.


121
0:7:3,847 --> 0:7:6,687
Sandy was as fine
as a 7-year-old could be.


122
0:7:6,687 --> 0:7:10,247
She had the body of a 9-year-old.


123
0:7:10,247 --> 0:7:12,847
l joined the T-ball team
because she was on it.


124
0:7:12,847 --> 0:7:15,607
l didn't care that much about sports.


125
0:7:15,607 --> 0:7:19,407
But, during the first game,
l got all caught up,


126
0:7:19,407 --> 0:7:21,807
and fell in love with competing.


127
0:7:21,807 --> 0:7:24,247
And so, through
high school and college,


128
0:7:24,247 --> 0:7:27,927
l pretty much played everything
because l needed to compete.


129
0:7:27,927 --> 0:7:31,567
lt was my drug.


130
0:7:31,567 --> 0:7:36,527
That's why l became a surgeon. Every day,
you get to step up to the table


131
0:7:36,527 --> 0:7:39,727
and go one-on-one against
what's wrong with the patient.


132
0:7:39,727 --> 0:7:43,87
And if you're really good at it,


133
0:7:43,87 --> 0:7:47,647
you win most of the time.


134
0:7:47,647 --> 0:7:50,167
l ran into Sandy Lowe last Christmas,


135
0:7:50,167 --> 0:7:52,127
and she didn't look so good.


136
0:7:52,127 --> 0:7:55,927
And that was kind of awkward, cos,


137
0:7:55,927 --> 0:8:7,927
well, l look like this.


138
0:8:7,927 --> 0:8:10,167
Are you following me?


139
0:8:10,167 --> 0:8:12,567
No. You wanna go out some time?


140
0:8:12,567 --> 0:8:14,7
With you?


141
0:8:14,7 --> 0:8:17,567
Me and a bottle of Jagermeister.


142
0:8:17,567 --> 0:8:20,487
No, Todd, l don't.
But l don't want you to think


143
0:8:20,487 --> 0:8:22,847
it's because l'm a lesbian or anything.


144
0:8:22,847 --> 0:8:28,767
l find you so creepy, l think you should
walk around with a bell around your neck.


145
0:8:28,767 --> 0:8:31,7
All l heard was ''lesbian''.


146
0:8:31,7 --> 0:8:34,967
Let me talk to her for you.


147
0:8:34,967 --> 0:8:36,847
Why did he ask me out?


148
0:8:36,847 --> 0:8:40,167
l don't know.
Because you're cute and you're fun,


149
0:8:40,167 --> 0:8:45,7
and l told him to. Plus, there's rumours
going around that you're a lesbian.


150
0:8:45,7 --> 0:8:50,167
You told me not to tell anyone about us,
so maybe l just wanna make a point.


151
0:8:50,167 --> 0:8:59,47
And now l'm gonna kiss you.


152
0:8:59,47 --> 0:9:3,447
lt's cool. JD's in the closet
talking to a girl for me.


153
0:9:3,447 --> 0:9:5,927
White boys.


154
0:9:5,927 --> 0:9:58,87
You too.


155
0:9:58,87 --> 0:10:2,447
When l was little, my mom used to
have what she called ''episodes''.


156
0:10:2,447 --> 0:10:7,727
''Episodes'' is a flattering term
for this thing where she'd sweat a lot and...


157
0:10:7,727 --> 0:10:11,367
Let's just say her stomach talked.


158
0:10:11,367 --> 0:10:14,487
Anyway, this one time,
we were at the supermarket


159
0:10:14,487 --> 0:10:16,207
and she actually passed out.


160
0:10:16,207 --> 0:10:19,567
And out of nowhere,
this fancy-looking guy comes forward


161
0:10:19,567 --> 0:10:24,47
and tells everyone to step aside
and give my mother some air.


162
0:10:24,47 --> 0:10:26,807
And everyone did.


163
0:10:26,807 --> 0:10:31,727
You have to understand, in my family,
nobody listens to a word anyone else says.


164
0:10:31,727 --> 0:10:36,127
Even screaming
at the top of our lungs... nothing.


165
0:10:36,127 --> 0:10:40,847
So when this man said,
''Step aside'', and everyone did,


166
0:10:40,847 --> 0:10:43,567
l asked my aunt, ''Who is this guy?''


167
0:10:43,567 --> 0:10:47,767
And she said he was a doctor.


168
0:10:47,767 --> 0:10:50,327
And l thought,


169
0:10:50,327 --> 0:10:56,207
''l want to be a doctor too.''


170
0:10:56,207 --> 0:11:0,247
But when l lost my first tooth,
and nobody left $1 80,000


171
0:11:0,247 --> 0:11:4,847
under my pillow,
l decided to become a nurse.


172
0:11:4,847 --> 0:11:14,567
We do all the real stuff anyway.


173
0:11:14,567 --> 0:11:18,207
- You OK?
- Yeah.


174
0:11:18,207 --> 0:11:23,607
l may eventually need a vagina transplant.


175
0:11:23,607 --> 0:11:26,327
Go! Go!


176
0:11:26,327 --> 0:11:29,607
We don't have much time!


177
0:11:29,607 --> 0:11:31,287
You know what?


178
0:11:31,287 --> 0:11:36,327
After l have sex five times with somebody,
l like to have the relationship talk.


179
0:11:36,327 --> 0:11:38,807
l know it seems rushed,
but five times


180
0:11:38,807 --> 0:11:45,127
usually takes me anywhere
between six months and seven years.


181
0:11:45,127 --> 0:11:47,727
Let's do it.
Let's have the talk.


182
0:11:47,727 --> 0:11:50,527
- You my boyfriend?
- Yep. You my girlfriend?


183
0:11:50,527 --> 0:11:52,47
- Yep.
- Cool.


184
0:11:52,47 --> 0:11:54,407
Good to talk things through.


185
0:11:54,407 --> 0:11:56,687
l love that little laugh.


186
0:11:56,687 --> 0:12:7,287
From now on, that is your laugh.


187
0:12:7,287 --> 0:12:8,727
What?


188
0:12:8,727 --> 0:12:13,727
l've seen you naked, so everything
you're doing, l'm watching you do it naked.


189
0:12:13,727 --> 0:12:18,887
So, if l go like this...


190
0:12:18,887 --> 0:12:20,927
l just... l saw all of that.


191
0:12:20,927 --> 0:12:26,7
Don't be shy. Come here, baby.


192
0:12:26,7 --> 0:12:32,87
- The echo report on the aorta...
- Bravo. Just a big bravo.


193
0:12:32,87 --> 0:12:35,247
Heaven help me,
l love newbie theatre.


194
0:12:35,247 --> 0:12:38,407
Honest, l do. lt's the way
you both play your parts


195
0:12:38,407 --> 0:12:41,967
with such wonderful commitment
that almost had me believing


196
0:12:41,967 --> 0:12:46,207
that you aren't having whiny, neurotic,
pale sex with each other.


197
0:12:46,207 --> 0:12:48,287
What are you talking about?


198
0:12:48,287 --> 0:12:51,767
The whole floor knows.
We do. Watch this.


199
0:12:51,767 --> 0:12:53,847
Laverne, did you know?


200
0:12:53,847 --> 0:12:57,47
Was it supposed to be a secret?


201
0:12:57,47 --> 0:12:58,967
And Carla?


202
0:12:58,967 --> 0:13:1,167
Please. l knew before they did.


203
0:13:1,167 --> 0:13:3,247
So, there it is.


204
0:13:3,247 --> 0:13:5,967
And if you go ahead
and listen very carefully,


205
0:13:5,967 --> 0:13:13,127
you'll hear the familiar sound
of no one caring.


206
0:13:13,127 --> 0:13:15,807
l like that guy.


207
0:13:15,807 --> 0:13:20,247
When the Kelsonoviches
settled in Monroeville, PA,


208
0:13:20,247 --> 0:13:23,7
there were two steel mills, three bars,


209
0:13:23,7 --> 0:13:25,607
and not a doctor in sight.


210
0:13:25,607 --> 0:13:29,167
Then my old man set up a shingle


211
0:13:29,167 --> 0:13:31,567
and started delivering babies


212
0:13:31,567 --> 0:13:36,847
and stitching up three-fingered
steel men by the wagonload.


213
0:13:36,847 --> 0:13:39,47
Everybody loved him.


214
0:13:39,47 --> 0:13:42,7
When they couldn't come up with the cash,


215
0:13:42,7 --> 0:13:45,207
he would gladly
accept a handmade sweater


216
0:13:45,207 --> 0:13:48,447
or a bushel of turnips.


217
0:13:48,447 --> 0:13:50,407
Jackass.


218
0:13:50,407 --> 0:13:58,527
Now l get to do this in public.


219
0:13:58,527 --> 0:14:1,967
This is a hospital, all right?
People here are already sick.


220
0:14:1,967 --> 0:14:3,727
You guys do it all the time.


221
0:14:3,727 --> 0:14:7,7
- Tell me we don't look like that.
- We don't look like that.


222
0:14:7,7 --> 0:14:8,847
You guys are just jealous


223
0:14:8,847 --> 0:14:12,167
cos you're not
the hot couple in town any more.


224
0:14:12,167 --> 0:14:14,287
Jealous, my chocolate butt!


225
0:14:14,287 --> 0:14:17,7
l'm telling you, we are so damn hot,


226
0:14:17,7 --> 0:14:19,967
last night, when l was
home waiting for Turk,


227
0:14:19,967 --> 0:14:24,807
l put on this tiny negligee. lt was so small
l took it off my Latin Barbie...


228
0:14:24,807 --> 0:14:28,7
When l got home, you were asleep,
drooling like a sheepdog.


229
0:14:28,7 --> 0:14:30,287
You don't have to tell 'em that.


230
0:14:30,287 --> 0:14:32,7
While you guys were sleeping,


231
0:14:32,7 --> 0:14:36,327
we were up in the kitchen
fryin' up some love.


232
0:14:36,327 --> 0:14:39,247
Relationships? Well, Sigmund,


233
0:14:39,247 --> 0:14:42,327
relationships are so fragile.


234
0:14:42,327 --> 0:14:45,807
lt just takes one thing, one...


235
0:14:45,807 --> 0:14:49,607
...tiny little offence,
and it can snowball on you.


236
0:14:49,607 --> 0:14:53,287
And if that snowball starts
to pick up speed, God forbid,


237
0:14:53,287 --> 0:14:57,167
you better tuck and go.


238
0:14:57,167 --> 0:14:59,767
Why did you do that?
How could you think


239
0:14:59,767 --> 0:15:3,407
that's appropriate conversation for work?


240
0:15:3,407 --> 0:15:8,47
- We didn't have sex.
- No.


241
0:15:8,47 --> 0:15:12,47
- Especially not on the stove. What?
- That is not funny.


242
0:15:12,47 --> 0:15:13,767
Sorry.


243
0:15:13,767 --> 0:15:19,567
We didn't.


244
0:15:19,567 --> 0:15:22,767
That's great. Thanks.


245
0:15:22,767 --> 0:15:24,927
Thanks a lot, JD. Really mature.


246
0:15:24,927 --> 0:15:27,127
Come on.


247
0:15:27,127 --> 0:15:37,527
Elliot.


248
0:15:37,527 --> 0:15:39,927
l am so full.


249
0:15:39,927 --> 0:15:43,127
- Give me another slice.
- Really?


250
0:15:43,127 --> 0:15:45,247
Yeah. Big one.


251
0:15:45,247 --> 0:15:49,527
l cannot have any more
until l work off the last two slices.


252
0:15:49,527 --> 0:15:53,687
So what do you say?
Fat, gassy, bloaty sex?


253
0:15:53,687 --> 0:15:57,287
OK.


254
0:15:57,287 --> 0:16:3,767
- l'm gonna puke!
- l don't care.


255
0:16:3,767 --> 0:16:5,687
Mr Lewis,


256
0:16:5,687 --> 0:16:8,527
we're gonna need another stool sample.


257
0:16:8,527 --> 0:16:13,367
Not for medical reasons.
My robot needs food.


258
0:16:13,367 --> 0:16:16,887
That laugh.


259
0:16:16,887 --> 0:16:19,687
But it's your laugh. l gave it to you.


260
0:16:19,687 --> 0:16:24,287
l love it so much,
l can't stop using it.


261
0:16:24,287 --> 0:16:26,927
lt's not as charming if you're mad.


262
0:16:26,927 --> 0:16:30,767
You only laugh at your own jokes.
You never laugh at anything l do.


263
0:16:30,767 --> 0:16:32,327
That's not true.


264
0:16:32,327 --> 0:16:34,807
...colonoscopy.
Dr Cox, l'm open!


265
0:16:34,807 --> 0:16:40,127
Hit me!


266
0:16:40,127 --> 0:16:42,447
There was nothing funny about that.


267
0:16:42,447 --> 0:16:45,727
Maybe you just don't know funny.
Let me help you out.


268
0:16:45,727 --> 0:16:49,607
Silly hats are funny.
<i>ALF?</i> Very funny!


269
0:16:49,607 --> 0:16:53,767
Anyone in a chicken suit...
Oversized phones are funny.


270
0:16:53,767 --> 0:16:56,87
- JD...
- Hold on.


271
0:16:56,87 --> 0:16:58,287
Hello?


272
0:16:58,287 --> 0:17:0,207
She's right here.


273
0:17:0,207 --> 0:17:2,127
lt's for you.


274
0:17:2,127 --> 0:17:5,927
You know what?
You're not as funny as you think you are.


275
0:17:5,927 --> 0:17:8,367
And bam!


276
0:17:8,367 --> 0:17:10,767
The shine's off the apple.


277
0:17:10,767 --> 0:17:14,7
That's when you find out that
that pretty girl you married


278
0:17:14,7 --> 0:17:18,407
isn't a pretty girl at all.
No. She's a man-eater.


279
0:17:18,407 --> 0:17:23,7
And l'm not talking about the ''Whoa,
whoa, here she comes'' kind of man-eater.


280
0:17:23,7 --> 0:17:27,87
l'm talking about the kind
that uses your dignity as a dishtowel


281
0:17:27,87 --> 0:17:33,167
to wipe up any shreds of manhood
that might be stuck inside the sink.


282
0:17:33,167 --> 0:17:35,687
l may have tormented her
from time to time,


283
0:17:35,687 --> 0:17:38,407
but that's what l thought
marriage was all about.


284
0:17:38,407 --> 0:17:41,607
So much so,
that by the end of that relationship,


285
0:17:41,607 --> 0:17:48,127
l honestly don't know
who l hated more: her or me.


286
0:17:48,127 --> 0:17:51,87
l used to sit around and wonder


287
0:17:51,87 --> 0:17:55,767
why our friends weren't trying
to destroy each other, like we were.


288
0:17:55,767 --> 0:18:1,127
And here it turns out
the answer's pretty simple.


289
0:18:1,127 --> 0:18:4,327
They weren't unhappy.


290
0:18:4,327 --> 0:18:11,847
We were.


291
0:18:11,847 --> 0:18:14,407
l suck at this.


292
0:18:14,407 --> 0:18:16,167
Sorry.


293
0:18:16,167 --> 0:18:18,7
You look great bent over.


294
0:18:18,7 --> 0:18:24,7
l rolled that damn thing exactly
the way the video l bought told me to.


295
0:18:24,7 --> 0:18:26,687
Probably just a bad ball.


296
0:18:26,687 --> 0:18:29,607
You don't have to patronise me.
Tell me that l suck.


297
0:18:29,607 --> 0:18:32,407
lt's hard to be honest
when you're so neurotic


298
0:18:32,407 --> 0:18:35,927
you don't even trust the computer
to keep your score.


299
0:18:35,927 --> 0:18:39,607
- l'm neurotic?
- l'm sorry!


300
0:18:39,607 --> 0:18:43,687
- ls it always this hard?
- Bowling's a tricky sport.


301
0:18:43,687 --> 0:18:45,727
- No, l meant...
- l know.


302
0:18:45,727 --> 0:18:48,927
lt's difficult for everybody.


303
0:18:48,927 --> 0:18:56,687
- My baby got a strike!
- l got a strike!


304
0:18:56,687 --> 0:18:58,927
- My baby did it!
- l got a strike!


305
0:18:58,927 --> 0:19:1,767
Knock 'em down!
My baby know how to knock 'em down!


306
0:19:1,767 --> 0:19:4,407
- Turk! l'm dizzy!
- Sorry.


307
0:19:4,407 --> 0:19:6,887
l'm sorry about him.


308
0:19:6,887 --> 0:19:13,607
My turn!


309
0:19:13,607 --> 0:19:20,647
Want me to pick you up?


310
0:19:20,647 --> 0:19:23,367
Enid has always understood


311
0:19:23,367 --> 0:19:26,127
how much my career meant to me.


312
0:19:26,127 --> 0:19:29,47
She knows
l'm an important man in my field,


313
0:19:29,47 --> 0:19:32,967
and it helps her get on all those
boards of things her friends are on.


314
0:19:32,967 --> 0:19:35,247
You know, like, bringing art


315
0:19:35,247 --> 0:19:40,447
to the underprivileged kids
in the community, blah, blah, blah.


316
0:19:40,447 --> 0:19:44,407
When l first met her,
she wanted to be a psychiatrist.


317
0:19:44,407 --> 0:19:46,767
But we both decided


318
0:19:46,767 --> 0:19:51,207
that that wasn't a fitting profession
for a family woman.


319
0:19:51,207 --> 0:19:54,447
No offence, sweetheart.


320
0:19:54,447 --> 0:19:56,807
l know she's grateful.


321
0:19:56,807 --> 0:19:59,167
She likes to joke that


322
0:19:59,167 --> 0:20:3,327
l choked the last breath of life
out of her long ago.


323
0:20:3,327 --> 0:20:6,567
Now she's just a shell of a woman.


324
0:20:6,567 --> 0:20:12,487
l think that's so cute.
l call her Shelly.


325
0:20:12,487 --> 0:20:15,607
You know, when l call her that,


326
0:20:15,607 --> 0:20:18,367
sometimes she laughs so hard,


327
0:20:18,367 --> 0:20:21,727
she cries a little.


328
0:20:21,727 --> 0:20:24,647
You should've gotten a cardiology fellow


329
0:20:24,647 --> 0:20:27,967
to give Mrs Zuckerman
a transvenous pacemaker one hour ago.


330
0:20:27,967 --> 0:20:30,167
Sir, l was waiting to see...


331
0:20:30,167 --> 0:20:32,927
You were waiting. l'm sorry, that's...


332
0:20:32,927 --> 0:20:35,407
That's my mistake.


333
0:20:35,407 --> 0:20:37,647
l'm gonna wait with ya.


334
0:20:37,647 --> 0:20:39,727
Dr Cox...


335
0:20:39,727 --> 0:20:41,847
Gotta give it time.
Because, you see,


336
0:20:41,847 --> 0:20:45,607
when you're waiting for someone
to get better all by themselves,


337
0:20:45,607 --> 0:20:48,647
the whole thing becomes about time.


338
0:20:48,647 --> 0:20:52,247
l was waiting to see if she would
tolerate her low heart rate,


339
0:20:52,247 --> 0:20:55,567
which is what the textbooks tell us to do.
Am l right, JD?


340
0:20:55,567 --> 0:21:0,647
- ls she right, JD?
- Technically, yes.


341
0:21:0,647 --> 0:21:4,7
But it's really a judgment call,


342
0:21:4,7 --> 0:21:6,367
and if she really was that bradycardic,


343
0:21:6,367 --> 0:21:10,367
l probably would've called the fellow.


344
0:21:10,367 --> 0:21:16,87
But l... That's me. l...


345
0:21:16,87 --> 0:21:19,47
Always side with the hoochie, Newbie?


346
0:21:19,47 --> 0:21:21,207
lt's a rookie mistake.


347
0:21:21,207 --> 0:21:26,7
You hate to see it.


348
0:21:26,7 --> 0:21:29,687
- Tell you about my girlfriend?
- Tell you about my boyfriend?


349
0:21:29,687 --> 0:21:33,367
OK.


350
0:21:33,367 --> 0:21:35,887
l can be myself around Carla.


351
0:21:35,887 --> 0:21:38,327
Turk makes me feel completely safe


352
0:21:38,327 --> 0:21:41,647
and totally independent
at the same time.


353
0:21:41,647 --> 0:21:46,487
And it's all the same,
whether l'm with her or with my boys.


354
0:21:46,487 --> 0:21:48,727
l can say whatever's on my mind.


355
0:21:48,727 --> 0:21:50,887
And even if he doesn't like it,


356
0:21:50,887 --> 0:21:53,807
even if he doesn't understand it,
he respects it.


357
0:21:53,807 --> 0:21:58,647
Don't get me wrong. l'm not gonna
give my boys a back rub.


358
0:21:58,647 --> 0:22:2,47
Sure, if a brother's got an itch,
l'll scratch it, but...


359
0:22:2,47 --> 0:22:4,767
He seems to like who l am.


360
0:22:4,767 --> 0:22:8,527
She's a cool lady.


361
0:22:8,527 --> 0:22:16,687
- l love her.
- l love him.


362
0:22:16,687 --> 0:22:19,327
l should've stood up for you
with Dr Cox.


363
0:22:19,327 --> 0:22:21,127
You should've.


364
0:22:21,127 --> 0:22:24,287
l don't want him to think
it's about our relationship.


365
0:22:24,287 --> 0:22:26,847
l know that you want Dr Cox
to respect you,


366
0:22:26,847 --> 0:22:29,167
but you should want me
to respect you too.


367
0:22:29,167 --> 0:22:32,407
lf l didn't respect you,
l wouldn't be having sex with you.


368
0:22:32,407 --> 0:22:36,447
- That's not true. l would be.
- lf you can't talk for real, forget it.


369
0:22:36,447 --> 0:22:39,887
A perfect dismount
off her high horse.


370
0:22:39,887 --> 0:22:43,767
lf you don't like something, say it.
Why hide behind stupid jokes?


371
0:22:43,767 --> 0:22:46,447
Why is it impossible for you
to let anything go?


372
0:22:46,447 --> 0:22:50,167
l let stuff go, like when you wouldn't
stand up for me with Dr Cox,


373
0:22:50,167 --> 0:22:52,807
or when you told everyone
we're having sex.


374
0:22:52,807 --> 0:22:56,887
- When are you letting that go?
- You wanna know why l won't let that go?


375
0:22:56,887 --> 0:22:59,47
You wouldn't stand up for me


376
0:22:59,47 --> 0:23:2,807
because you're terrified
that someone won't like you.


377
0:23:2,807 --> 0:23:5,527
And that's a bad thing?


378
0:23:5,527 --> 0:23:12,287
Why don't we get all my friends together
in a room and we'll fight your friend.


379
0:23:12,287 --> 0:23:14,367
l'm getting so tired of this.


380
0:23:14,367 --> 0:23:16,607
Elliot, this is me.


381
0:23:16,607 --> 0:23:21,127
And there's a lot of people here
who like me for who l am.


382
0:23:21,127 --> 0:23:26,567
- l thought you were one of 'em.
- l thought l was too.


383
0:23:26,567 --> 0:23:30,927
Relationships don't work
the way they do in the movies.


384
0:23:30,927 --> 0:23:35,327
Will they? Won't they? They finally do
and they're happy for ever.


385
0:23:35,327 --> 0:23:39,247
Nine out of ten end because they
weren't right for each other to begin with,


386
0:23:39,247 --> 0:23:42,287
and half of the ones that get married
get divorced anyway.


387
0:23:42,287 --> 0:23:45,487
And through all this,
l have not become a cynic.


388
0:23:45,487 --> 0:23:50,127
l do happen to believe
that love is mainly about


389
0:23:50,127 --> 0:23:55,607
pushing chocolate-covered candies,
and you know, in some cultures, a chicken.


390
0:23:55,607 --> 0:23:58,87
You can call me a sucker.
l don't care.


391
0:23:58,87 --> 0:24:2,247
Because l do believe in it.


392
0:24:2,247 --> 0:24:6,87
Bottom line is couples
that are right for each other


393
0:24:6,87 --> 0:24:8,647
wade through the same crap
as everybody else.


394
0:24:8,647 --> 0:24:12,407
But the big difference is,
they don't let it take 'em down.


395
0:24:12,407 --> 0:24:16,7
One of those two people
will fight for that relationship


396
0:24:16,7 --> 0:24:21,247
every time, if it's right
and they're real lucky.


397
0:24:21,247 --> 0:24:35,527
One of 'em will say something.


398
0:24:35,527 --> 0:24:39,207
Things that wouldn't have bothered
you a week ago in a friendship


399
0:24:39,207 --> 0:24:45,887
become so incredibly important
when sex is involved.


400
0:24:45,887 --> 0:24:49,287
l just think it'd be easier


401
0:24:49,287 --> 0:24:52,687
if you weren't friends
with your girlfriend


402
0:24:52,687 --> 0:24:55,247
at all.


403
0:24:55,247 --> 0:24:59,567
l've always been sure about everything.
Sure that l wanted to be a doctor,


404
0:24:59,567 --> 0:25:4,287
and l was sure that l was gonna
be married by the time l was 25.


405
0:25:4,287 --> 0:25:7,327
But relationships...


406
0:25:7,327 --> 0:25:10,647
l always heard that
when they were right, they were easy.


407
0:25:10,647 --> 0:25:13,847
That even when things got hard


408
0:25:13,847 --> 0:25:16,527
that they were easy.


409
0:25:16,527 --> 0:25:19,287
l don't get that at all.


410
0:25:19,287 --> 0:25:22,367
How is that possible?


411
0:25:22,367 --> 0:25:26,407
Am l in a relationship now?


412
0:25:26,407 --> 0:25:33,207
No. l'm not in one now.


413
0:25:33,207 --> 0:25:53,527
No.


414
0:25:53,527 --> 0:25:55,527
l can't believe today's over.


415
0:25:55,527 --> 0:25:59,167
- l can't believe l ate half a pizza.
- Please. You had two pieces.


416
0:25:59,167 --> 0:26:3,727
lf you tell anyone anything about today,
please leave that part out.


417
0:26:3,727 --> 0:26:13,487
l will, cos l'm a gentleman.


418
0:26:13,487 --> 0:26:15,727
Do you think this is gonna work out?


419
0:26:15,727 --> 0:26:26,327
Yeah. l think it's gonna be great.


420
0:26:26,327 --> 0:26:29,207
l believe you.


421
0:26:29,207 --> 0:28:29,207
l believe me too.
