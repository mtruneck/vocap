0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:11,736



2
0:0:11,736 --> 0:0:12,986
[CAR HORN].


3
0:0:12,986 --> 0:0:15,159



4
0:0:15,159 --> 0:0:17,49
KEVIN JONES: That's
one sick ass line.


5
0:0:17,49 --> 0:0:19,28
-[INAUDIBLE].


6
0:0:19,28 --> 0:0:20,62
KEVIN JONES: [INAUDIBLE].


7
0:0:20,62 --> 0:0:22,36
Get out of here, [INAUDIBLE]


8
0:0:22,36 --> 0:0:23,61
on the line.


9
0:0:23,61 --> 0:0:39,194



10
0:0:39,194 --> 0:0:43,56
MATHIEU CREPEL: I think Kevin
took freestyle snowboarding to


11
0:0:43,56 --> 0:0:44,58
another level.


12
0:0:44,58 --> 0:0:47,11
Like the thing that I remember
most about Kevin was that


13
0:0:47,11 --> 0:0:50,14
first frontside 1080 in
the back country.


14
0:0:50,14 --> 0:0:53,91
Nobody at that time thought
it was possible, and


15
0:0:53,91 --> 0:0:55,82
then, boom, did it.


16
0:0:55,82 --> 0:0:57,81
And it was amazing.


17
0:0:57,81 --> 0:1:0,1
KEVIN JONES: And of course,
whenever you do something, you


18
0:1:0,1 --> 0:1:1,88
don't know if you do
it good or not.


19
0:1:1,88 --> 0:1:5,31
Because back in those days, you
had to wait two weeks for


20
0:1:5,31 --> 0:1:6,85
film to be actually
transferred.


21
0:1:6,85 --> 0:1:10,82
TIM MANNING: All of us filmers
would shoot as much


22
0:1:10,82 --> 0:1:12,33
footage as we could.


23
0:1:12,33 --> 0:1:13,95
We get the film processed.


24
0:1:13,95 --> 0:1:16,15
The footage would come
back in a VHS tape.


25
0:1:16,15 --> 0:1:19,76
And everybody would show up
in Mike's family room.


26
0:1:19,76 --> 0:1:22,5
And you're sitting there biting
your teeth hoping that


27
0:1:22,5 --> 0:1:25,24
that one shot you had in mind
came out exactly the way you


28
0:1:25,24 --> 0:1:25,95
thought it would.


29
0:1:25,95 --> 0:1:29,87
And then Mike or David would be
like, ah, kind of a bobble


30
0:1:29,87 --> 0:1:32,712
in the beginning, like you
kind blew the shot.


31
0:1:32,712 --> 0:1:33,86
MIKE HATCHETT: Shooting
film is a


32
0:1:33,86 --> 0:1:35,47
totally different monster.


33
0:1:35,47 --> 0:1:38,55
When you shoot film, you got
to make it count, just like


34
0:1:38,55 --> 0:1:41,83
press the button and look at
your shot, and go, oh, my


35
0:1:41,83 --> 0:1:42,19
framing's off.


36
0:1:42,19 --> 0:1:43,62
I wish I did that.


37
0:1:43,62 --> 0:1:44,92
Delete.


38
0:1:44,92 --> 0:1:47,59
So the film thing
is definitely--


39
0:1:47,59 --> 0:1:50,68
you learn to be more
conservative and press the


40
0:1:50,68 --> 0:1:52,73
button when you know you
got your crap together.


41
0:1:52,73 --> 0:1:54,99
KEVIN JONES: I mean seriously
I couldn't


42
0:1:54,99 --> 0:1:55,93
sleep, I couldn't eat.


43
0:1:55,93 --> 0:1:59,27
I was like, dude, if I blow
my chance with these guys,


44
0:1:59,27 --> 0:2:2,41
because back then, that was
it, if I fucking blow my


45
0:2:2,41 --> 0:2:7,965
chance with these dudes, I'm
done, because it's money.


46
0:2:7,965 --> 0:2:9,25
MIKE HATCHETT: And this is
what we used to shoot.


47
0:2:9,25 --> 0:2:13,7
It was 100-foot daylight
loads, three minutes of


48
0:2:13,7 --> 0:2:17,87
footage, $1 a foot, so $100
every time you shoot this.


49
0:2:17,87 --> 0:2:19,95
So four rolls, one
day of shooting.


50
0:2:19,95 --> 0:2:24,1
Just the shooting costs
$400 for the one day.


51
0:2:24,1 --> 0:2:26,59
So we used to shoot
on 16 millimeter.


52
0:2:26,59 --> 0:2:29,21
And this is all--


53
0:2:29,21 --> 0:2:29,83
what was it?


54
0:2:29,83 --> 0:2:31,8
Did we go to 2005?


55
0:2:31,8 --> 0:2:31,95
When did we stop
shooting film?


56
0:2:31,95 --> 0:2:33,13
I think it was 2005.


57
0:2:33,13 --> 0:2:35,0
So this is basically 1989.


58
0:2:35,0 --> 0:2:36,87
And then, two years, I
worked for Fall Line.


59
0:2:36,87 --> 0:2:40,97
And then, once we did "TB2" with
Mack Dawg, all the way to


60
0:2:40,97 --> 0:2:45,25
2005, and these are stacked
double, so they're always like


61
0:2:45,25 --> 0:2:47,51
twice as many in here as
you can see right now.


62
0:2:47,51 --> 0:2:49,98
So yeah, it's kind of funny if
you think about the past.


63
0:2:49,98 --> 0:2:52,55
When you stop to watch a
trailer, we make a movie.


64
0:2:52,55 --> 0:2:54,62
And we make like the
TV for a trailer.


65
0:2:54,62 --> 0:2:56,44
We put on VHS.


66
0:2:56,44 --> 0:2:57,66
And then, they sent
out to the shops.


67
0:2:57,66 --> 0:2:59,19
And the only way to see the
trailer is if you were in a


68
0:2:59,19 --> 0:3:2,42
shop, because there
was no internet.


69
0:3:2,42 --> 0:3:7,12
And now, to watch a trailer, you
just make one click, and


70
0:3:7,12 --> 0:3:7,87
you just watch it.


71
0:3:7,87 --> 0:3:9,43
A lot of people who are 15
years old right now are


72
0:3:9,43 --> 0:3:11,67
watching the movies don't
realize you couldn't just


73
0:3:11,67 --> 0:3:12,72
click and watch something.


74
0:3:12,72 --> 0:3:15,75
You certainly couldn't just
click to a BitTorrent, steal


75
0:3:15,75 --> 0:3:16,51
it for free.


76
0:3:16,51 --> 0:3:20,9
You had to buy it or put two
VHS machines together


77
0:3:20,9 --> 0:3:24,1
obviously and copy
a tape to tape.


78
0:3:24,1 --> 0:3:25,32
A lot has changed,
that's for sure.


79
0:3:25,32 --> 0:3:26,47
DAVE HATCHETT: There's something
cool about just


80
0:3:26,47 --> 0:3:29,38
making a DVD, and something you
can hold in your hands,


81
0:3:29,38 --> 0:3:31,63
and the anticipation of waiting
for that movie to come


82
0:3:31,63 --> 0:3:34,66
out, and see what all the
writers did and if they can


83
0:3:34,66 --> 0:3:36,49
actually one up their segments
from last year.


84
0:3:36,49 --> 0:3:37,62
And I think that really
helps drive the


85
0:3:37,62 --> 0:3:38,92
progression of the sport.


86
0:3:38,92 --> 0:3:41,57
As much as I like the YouTube
and all the free content out


87
0:3:41,57 --> 0:3:44,18
there, I really think it's
important to kind of have at


88
0:3:44,18 --> 0:3:47,15
least one or two or three good
movies out there a year that


89
0:3:47,15 --> 0:3:50,94
the kids can buy and watch
that's not just a YouTube


90
0:3:50,94 --> 0:3:51,48
phenomenon.


91
0:3:51,48 --> 0:3:54,12
JUSSI OKSANEN: I think when I
look back my snowboard career,


92
0:3:54,12 --> 0:3:58,33
I think I was very lucky to get
in with those guys in the


93
0:3:58,33 --> 0:4:0,9
first place, because
they're super


94
0:4:0,9 --> 0:4:3,16
professional and organized.


95
0:4:3,16 --> 0:4:6,27
We wake up pretty much four
in the morning every day.


96
0:4:6,27 --> 0:4:8,84
AARON SEDWAY: You know, back in
the day, it was always like


97
0:4:8,84 --> 0:4:11,24
pulling teeth to get the riders
to get up that early.


98
0:4:11,24 --> 0:4:13,89
And I think it's still
is these days.


99
0:4:13,89 --> 0:4:16,86
You know, they probably lose
some riders too that don't


100
0:4:16,86 --> 0:4:19,92
want to always get up that
early to get out there.


101
0:4:19,92 --> 0:4:22,256
But it's kind of what
you got to do.


102
0:4:22,256 --> 0:4:25,33
JIM RIPPEY: If you want to be
one of those guys, one of


103
0:4:25,33 --> 0:4:28,16
those snowboarders in those
movies, it really all comes


104
0:4:28,16 --> 0:4:29,24
down to hard work.


105
0:4:29,24 --> 0:4:32,18
So you're up before it's even
light, and you're getting


106
0:4:32,18 --> 0:4:35,7
together and heading out to
where you've got to go.


107
0:4:35,7 --> 0:4:37,65
And usually, you got to hike
through a lot of powder and


108
0:4:37,65 --> 0:4:41,23
get to your obstacle, fix your
takeoff, get ready to do it.


109
0:4:41,23 --> 0:4:44,18
And then, when the light comes
out, and it's good enough, be


110
0:4:44,18 --> 0:4:44,94
ready to go.


111
0:4:44,94 --> 0:4:47,21
MIKE HATCHETT: If you want to
get some footage in the can,


112
0:4:47,21 --> 0:4:51,5
the sun comes up, and you only
have from sun rise until about


113
0:4:51,5 --> 0:4:55,2
11:30 or noon to shoot, and
everything goes in the shade.


114
0:4:55,2 --> 0:4:57,84
So yeah, it's all about the
lighting, and caring about the


115
0:4:57,84 --> 0:4:59,725
lighting, and that's why
we get up so early.


116
0:4:59,725 --> 0:5:2,27
JUSSI OKSANEN: A load of riders
came by Mike's house,


117
0:5:2,27 --> 0:5:4,33
like they try to film for
a standard movie.


118
0:5:4,33 --> 0:5:9,31
And then, they will get burnt
out like in two weeks.


119
0:5:9,31 --> 0:5:11,9
They come and stay
like a week, and


120
0:5:11,9 --> 0:5:13,42
they're like fuck this.


121
0:5:13,42 --> 0:5:14,95
This sucks.


122
0:5:14,95 --> 0:5:16,99
I don't want to wake up at
four in the morning.


123
0:5:16,99 --> 0:5:20,36
TOM BURT: The nice thing about
Standard, they had the


124
0:5:20,36 --> 0:5:23,96
willingness to put in the time
and energy to go out


125
0:5:23,96 --> 0:5:25,91
there and be there.


126
0:5:25,91 --> 0:5:28,12
I'd say it's one of those things
that has always set


127
0:5:28,12 --> 0:5:29,83
them apart.


128
0:5:29,83 --> 0:5:32,11
Now, a lot of people have
pretty much copied what


129
0:5:32,11 --> 0:5:33,105
they've done.


130
0:5:33,105 --> 0:5:36,24
DAVE HATCHETT: To me, the best
snowboarder film companies


131
0:5:36,24 --> 0:5:38,62
will always be the ones
that show everything.


132
0:5:38,62 --> 0:5:41,1
I want to grab people segments,
but I also want to


133
0:5:41,1 --> 0:5:42,47
see people talking.


134
0:5:42,47 --> 0:5:45,55
I want to see the guys break it
down, and just really get


135
0:5:45,55 --> 0:5:48,51
to the feeling of what it's like
to ride a snowboard and


136
0:5:48,51 --> 0:5:51,54
the thing that we all embrace
and love about snowboarding,


137
0:5:51,54 --> 0:5:53,49
but really shows the cutting
edge of what's going on.


138
0:5:53,49 --> 0:5:56,64
And I think, ultimately, the
best snowboard movie has yet


139
0:5:56,64 --> 0:5:57,12
to be made.


140
0:5:57,12 --> 0:5:58,4
LONNIE KAUK: I think that's
where all this


141
0:5:58,4 --> 0:5:59,69
film stuff's heading.


142
0:5:59,69 --> 0:6:1,14
It's not just like, oh, banger,
banger, banger,


143
0:6:1,14 --> 0:6:2,99
banger, banger, stop.


144
0:6:2,99 --> 0:6:5,2
We know nothing about
this person.


145
0:6:5,2 --> 0:6:6,52
Who is this guy?


146
0:6:6,52 --> 0:6:7,32
What does he feel?


147
0:6:7,32 --> 0:6:9,96
Does he go to the store?


148
0:6:9,96 --> 0:6:12,36
Does he like wash his clothes?


149
0:6:12,36 --> 0:6:16,29
Does he do the things
that everybody does?


150
0:6:16,29 --> 0:6:18,83
Of course, so show it.


151
0:6:18,83 --> 0:6:20,96
Because really, I think with a
video part, it's all about


152
0:6:20,96 --> 0:6:24,7
music and be able to capture
that person.


153
0:6:24,7 --> 0:6:29,3
MATHIEU CREPEL: I've always
loved snowboarding as like a


154
0:6:29,3 --> 0:6:33,157
global thing and not on the rail
or not on the contest are


155
0:6:33,157 --> 0:6:35,46
not only filming or
back country.


156
0:6:35,46 --> 0:6:37,19
I love to do everything.


157
0:6:37,19 --> 0:6:40,9
And I think this is the heart
of Standard films.


158
0:6:40,9 --> 0:6:45,5
It's just like grab your board
and try to show like what


159
0:6:45,5 --> 0:6:46,35
snowboarding means to me.


160
0:6:46,35 --> 0:6:50,3
And if it's like a rail,
or park day, or


161
0:6:50,3 --> 0:6:51,84
[INAUDIBLE], just do it.


162
0:6:51,84 --> 0:6:54,355
And that's what I love in
snowboarding because you get


163
0:6:54,355 --> 0:6:54,93
your stick.


164
0:6:54,93 --> 0:6:56,35
We got mountains.


165
0:6:56,35 --> 0:6:56,84
Go for it.


166
0:6:56,84 --> 0:6:57,666
Ride.


167
0:6:57,666 --> 0:6:59,9
MIKE HATCHETT: Rewind
in 20 years.


168
0:6:59,9 --> 0:7:3,42
I didn't think I'd be sitting
here now making a 20th video.


169
0:7:3,42 --> 0:7:6,13
For sure, the first couple
years, I definitely didn't


170
0:7:6,13 --> 0:7:8,28
think we'd be getting to 20.


171
0:7:8,28 --> 0:7:10,35
When we got to 15, I was
thinking there's a good chance


172
0:7:10,35 --> 0:7:12,3
we make it to 20.


173
0:7:12,3 --> 0:7:13,88
Or pretty much, when we got
to 15, I knew I had


174
0:7:13,88 --> 0:7:16,75
to make it to 20.


175
0:7:16,75 --> 0:7:20,94
But yeah, I mean, I remember the
first couple of years just


176
0:7:20,94 --> 0:7:22,69
being nervous we could
even make a movie.


177
0:7:22,69 --> 0:7:25,61
Like are we going to have
enough footage?


178
0:7:25,61 --> 0:7:26,46
It's not going to happen.


179
0:7:26,46 --> 0:7:27,47
We're not going to
get enough--


180
0:7:27,47 --> 0:7:28,33
I would be so panicked.


181
0:7:28,33 --> 0:7:30,26
I'd stay up at night.


182
0:7:30,26 --> 0:7:32,27
And then, after like six
or seven movies--


183
0:7:32,27 --> 0:7:34,63
I think it was actually after 10
movies, I finally realized,


184
0:7:34,63 --> 0:7:38,34
like you know what, you shoot
all year, you make a movie.


185
0:7:38,34 --> 0:7:40,51
It might not be as good as the
one the year before or it


186
0:7:40,51 --> 0:7:41,9
might be better.


187
0:7:41,9 --> 0:7:43,545
You're not always going to hit
a home run, or maybe you're


188
0:7:43,545 --> 0:7:46,73
never going to hit a home run as
far some people could say.


189
0:7:46,73 --> 0:7:48,968
If you shoot all year,
you'll make a movie.


190
0:7:48,968 --> 0:7:57,572



191
0:7:57,572 --> 0:7:59,63
KEVIN JONES: If you were to
told me three years ago,


192
0:7:59,63 --> 0:8:3,21
you're going to be on TV, I
would have laughed at you.


193
0:8:3,21 --> 0:8:8,69
The first film I filmed was
"TB5." 15 years later, I'm


194
0:8:8,69 --> 0:8:10,135
still in a movie.


195
0:8:10,135 --> 0:8:14,595
And to be a part of this is
seriously a dream come true.


196

DAVE DOWNING: Well, I expect
"TB20" to be a diverse,


198
0:8:25,2 --> 0:8:28,2
progressive snowboarding movie
with some Alaska stuff in it,


199
0:8:28,2 --> 0:8:31,13
big mountain stuff, and some
handrail stuff and jumps and


200
0:8:31,13 --> 0:8:31,58
everything.


201
0:8:31,58 --> 0:8:35,82
So I know Mike has always wanted
it to be like that.


202
0:8:35,82 --> 0:8:37,864
And I hope that's
what "TB20" is.


203
0:8:37,864 --> 0:8:39,416
I'm sure it will be.


204
0:8:39,416 --> 0:8:42,429
JEREMY JONES: Yeah, I'm
definitely not surprised that


205
0:8:42,429 --> 0:8:45,445
Standard's still in the game
making snowboarding movies.


206
0:8:45,445 --> 0:8:50,49
They have so much passion, so
much knowledge, and still


207
0:8:50,49 --> 0:8:53,74
really love to get out
there and tread.


208
0:8:53,74 --> 0:8:56,44
Yeah, the question is will
be there a "TB30"?
