###83 We had a major success when we deployed the arm for the first time on Mars.
###88 This is critical to ensuring that we can get sample into our instruments and use the arm
###93 for its scientific purposes.
###96 The ChemCam unit, or chemistry and camera instrument, fired the laser for the first
###100 time on Mars, using the beam from the science instrument to interrogate a fist-sized rock
###105 called coronation.
###107 Before we could drive curiosity, we wanted to wiggle our toes a bit and test the steering
###113 actuators.
###113 This is the first time we moved the wheels on Mars.
###116 We hit a major milestone on Mars.
###119 We completed our first drive of the curiosity rover.
###124 We drove approximately 3 meters forward and performed 2 60-degree rotations in a clockwise
###129 direction with imaging in between.
###132 We then drove backwards just under 3 meters in order to test the wheels in the opposite
###137 direction.
###138 This put us in a great configuration to make observations of the scours left by the descent
###144 stage engines.
###150 We’ve got a very interesting science experiment coming up here on Mars.
###159 We are turning on the sample analysis at Mars instrument for the first time to do an atmospheric
###165 experiment.
###166 This is where we let in atmosphere into the instrument and perform various science experiments
###170 that determine the composition of the atmosphere.
###173 This is the first time that this is happening.
###176 Within days, we will start our journey to our first chosen destination on Mars, Glenelg.
###181 We hope to obtain our first drilled rock sample on Mars at this location.
###185 The team named the landing site this week after the famous science fiction author, Ray
###189 Bradbury, on his birthday, august 22nd, and he would have been 92.
###202 Curiosity is still is heading to Glenelg. We've just stopped at the Bathurst rock formation
###205 to check it out with the robotic arm mounted instruments: a hand lens imager and a spectrometer.
###210 Got some great science data there for the science team and now we're moving to a new
###214 rover location called Rocknest. And we've come to Rocknest because it has nice windblown
###218 sand drifts.
###219 At the Rocknest location we really are entering a new phase in Mars exploration with Curiosity.
###226 We're starting the surface sampling part of the mission. The reason this is a one-ton
###230 rover with a 200-pound robotic arm, is because we have these tools to acquire bits of Mars,
###236 you know, either with a scoop or with a drill; process those samples for our very sensitive
###242 analytical lab instruments.
###243 So our scoop - this is not a giant backhoe on Mars - we basically have more like an oversized
###249 tablespoon attached to the end of the arm and we grab on the order of 20 grams of material
###254 and we position the arm over the soil target and then we just actuate the scoop, do a little
###262 bit of vibration to kind of level out the sample and then raise the arm up, close the
###267 scoop and carry on with our sampling activity.
###274 When we first arrived at Rocknest, we performed a wheel scuff maneuver. This is our rover's
###279 version of kicking up the dirt with your hiking boot to determine if the Rocknest area was
###283 indeed a good first scoop target.
###285 The first scoop was successfully performed on Sol 61 and the entire team was excited
###290 to see the MastCam images showing the scoop full of dirt, as well as the video of the
###295 vibration activities performed with the turret-mounted tools. This vibration allows the team to level
###301 out and remove any excess sample before closing the scoop, and it also provides some insight
###307 into the makeup of the soil.
###309 Any large particles would tend to float up to the top as the entire sample is vibrated,
###313 much the same way you would shake out the marshmallows in your box of Lucky Charms.
###319 Curiosity processed the scoop sample through CHIMRA, our labyrinth of passageways at the
###323 end of the arm that we use to sieve and portion the soil sample. We did some internal sandblasting
###328 by vibrating the sample at different orientations on the turret in order to remove any internal
###333 contamination.
###334 A soil sample was dropped off to the rover’s observation tray for assessment by the science
###339 team. This sample was determined to be suitable for drop off to the CheMin instrument.
###345 The CheMin instrument uses X-rays in order to image the sample and determine what minerals
###351 make it up. This helps geologists understand how the rock formed and how it's related to
###356 other rocks we've studied so far on Mars.
###359 Scientists identified numerous bright grains in the soil. Because of the small piece of
###364 plastic from the landing event that had been found earlier in the week, the team proceeded
###369 cautiously, dumping the second scoop collected and imaging the bright grains.
###374 These bright grains were later determined to be components of the Martian soil, and
###378 therefore, the sample was deemed to be suitable for delivery to the CheMin instrument for
###383 analysis.
###384 The science team requested MastCam and NavCam mosaics of the outcrops in the direction of
###390 Glenelg, to plan Curiosity's journey to this next science destination.
###394 In its spare time, Curiosity has also been making measurements with other instruments,
###397 including the ChemCam instrument, which is what I work on.
###400 ChemCam is actually two instruments in one. It includes a camera with a telephoto lens
###404 and it also has a laser that vaporizes a very small amount of rock so we can tell what its
###409 chemical composition is.
###416 We've been analyzing rocks in an area called Rocknest, and I'll tell you in particular
###421 about one called Zephyr. This one is interesting because it appears to be made of 2 different
###426 types of materials.
###427 It's got this harder, more resistant material on the top, capping it, and then beneath it
###432 has a lighter colored softer material that appears to erode more easily. It's actually
###437 eroded into a set of natural arches, so some of our team members have taken to calling
###441 it "Stonehenge."
###444 This feature is really only an inch long. We're shooting this from about 8 feet away,
###449 making the pointing very difficult.
###451 So that's why we decided to do 9 points instead of just 2, just to make sure we would hit
###455 the material of interest.
###457 Coming up, we'll be able to use this information that we've learned from ChemCam in order to
###461 decide which targets we should hit next with other instruments.
###465 CheMin performs what we call X-ray diffraction measurements on powdered rocks and soil samples.
###470 An X-ray diffraction is the best method for telling us what minerals are present in a
###475 rock or soil because it is sensitive to the arrangements of atoms in minerals. As the
###480 X-rays strike the soil sample, CheMin shows us how mineral crystals distinctively interact
###484 with X-rays, and this image shows our first X-ray diffraction results. The diffraction
###490 signals appear on the detector as rings that represent the fingerprint of the individual
###494 minerals. The rings tell us not only what minerals are present in the soil but also
###498 how abundant they are.
###500 The CheMin data provide us with distinctive signatures of the minerals: plagioclase feldspar,
###505 pyroxenes, and olivines. Peridot is a variety of olivine; just keep in mind that the olivine
###510 in the soil sample is much smaller than these crystals. Roughly half of the soil consists
###515 of poorly crystalline material, such as volcanic glass. Thus, this Martian soil appears very
###520 similar to some weathered basaltic soils that we see on Earth, in places like the flanks
###524 of Mauna Kea, Hawaii.
###526 You can appreciate how revolutionary CheMin is when you consider that instruments of this
###530 type on Earth are typically about the size of a doublewide refrigerator and the CheMin
###535 instrument on the Mars Science Laboratory is about the size of a shoebox. CheMin has
###540 been modified for use on Earth in places such as Antarctica and the Arctic.
###544 It's also been applied for the detection of counterfeit pharmaceuticals around the worlds
###549 and a modification of the instrument has been used in archeological studies to help us understand
###554 the nature of the surfaces and how we might protect them.
###557 In the coming weeks and months, we're excited to measure more X-ray diffraction data on
###561 soils and rocks to tell us much more about the geology of Gale Crater.
###565 While our robotic explorer has been busy characterizing the surface of Mars, the SAM team has also
###571 been busy, but we've been looking at something invisible, the Martian atmosphere.
###576 SAM, or Sample Analysis at Mars, is not one instrument, but three, all of which are designed
###583 to work together to chemically characterize Mars. SAM measures chemical elements and molecules,
###589 in a mass or size range between 2 and 535 mass units and we do this by looking at gases.
###598 We can bake solid samples until they give up their volatile components or their gases
###603 or we can directly inhale the Martian atmosphere through our inlet ports.
###608 With our QMS, SAM is able to detect the most dominant gas in the Martian atmosphere, carbon
###614 dioxide. We've not only measured its abundance and the ratio to other gases in the Martian
###619 atmosphere but we've also measured its isotopic character. The other instruments are a tunable
###626 laser spectrometer and a gas chromatograph, the latter being used mostly to look for organic
###632 molecules in solids.
###634 Now, the tunable laser spectrometer has a special role for SAM in that it can very sensitively
###640 detect the organic molecule, methane, which has been observed from the Earth telescopically
###647 and also by the Mars Express orbiter at very, very low limits in the Martian atmosphere.
###654 We're trying to discover whether or not we can see this molecule from the Martian surface
###659 and if it has any variation from season to season. In the coming months, wherever Curiosity
###666 goes, SAM will continue to sniff the Martian atmosphere, periodically looking for changes
###672 on a seasonal or maybe even diurnal basis and that will tell us something about the
###676 dynamics of the exchange between the surface and the atmosphere.
###681 A lot of what this mission is about is figuring out the possibility that ancient Mars was
###686 a habitable environment. But we're also studying the present environment. Two instruments that
###690 help with that are the RAD instrument and the REMS instrument.
###694 The RAD instrument is a radiation assessment detector. It measures the high-energy radiation
###699 coming up from the cosmic rays and the sun. That radiation is changed as it goes through
###705 Mars' atmosphere to where we detect it on the surface.
###708 These measurements are helping to understand what the environment is like on the surface
###712 so that future astronauts will know how to protect themselves from this radiation.
###718 Another instrument that Curiosity has that measures the modern environment is called
###722 the rover environmental monitoring station. It's basically our weather station. We measure
###727 a lot of things including pressure and humidity, temperature and wind.
###731 It's been seeing little dips in pressure around noon that seemed like the signature of dust
###737 devils. Only thing is our pictures haven't turned up any dust devils.
###741 Spirit and Opportunity saw lots of dust devils moving across the horizon. Our best guess
###745 at what's going on is that Curiosity is seeing dust devils go right over it.
###750 So what we think is happening is the same sorts of vortexes, driven by convection are
###755 occurring on Mars at the Curiosity's site but just not picking up dust.
###760 Another thing that REMS has been measuring is winds. Turns out we're in a pretty interesting
###763 place inside of Gale Crater. We're right at the base of a 5-kilometer high mountain to
###768 the south of us and then there's a pretty tall crater rim to the north of us and we're
###772 sitting in kind of a flat depression between the two.
###775 The winds blow up and down the mountain as the temperature changes during the day and
###779 up and down the crater slopes and then along the depression where we're at. So right now
###784 we're trying to figure out from the REMS data exactly which parts of that wind field we're
###788 measuring.
###792 After several weeks of being stationary at the Rocknest site, we began driving again
###796 on Saw 100.
###797 This marked a significant milestone on the mission as we reached about a half-kilometer
###802 of total driving distance on the surface of Mars.
###805 The left front wheel is sitting on a rock that we’ve dubbed “Bell Island”.
###809 We plan to back up off that rock to bring the rock into the arm’s workspace and we’re
###815 going to do some contact science on it with APXS and MAHLI.
###820 After completing our science campaign at our current location, we’re going to be moving
###823 to the east to a place called Point Lake.
###825 From here, we’re going to be looking for a target to perform our first ever drill on
###831 Mars.
###832 We've wrapped up our scientific study of Rocknest, which also means that we've completed the
###836 checkout and first scientific use of all our instruments on the rover and it truly is working
###842 great.
###842 We began the Rocknest campaign by searching for a suitable drift of sandy soil using our
###847 MastCam color cameras. We used out ChemCam laser and our APXS chemical sensor to do an
###852 initial chemical analysis of the soil, determining whether it was similar to soils that we understand
###857 from Spirit and Opportunity and therefore safe for scooping and sending to our laboratories.
###863 We use MAHLI, our hand lens imager to take close up views of the soil to look at different
###867 particle sizes, shapes and colors and how they change with depth.
###872 We then scooped up the soil and analyzed it with our X-ray diffraction instrument that
###876 can identify minerals in the soil based on their unique crystal structure. But it turned
###881 out that a good amount of the material in the soil was not crystalline but that's no
###884 problem for our other laboratory, SAM.
###887 SAM heated up the soil in an oven, measured various gases released as the soil components
###892 broke down, such as water, carbon dioxide, oxygen and sulfur.
###896 Not surprisingly, the results show a composition that is typical of Mars soils studied at other
###901 sites with perhaps some very simple carbon containing molecules and perchlorate salts.
###907 We haven't yet seen any complex organic molecules but sand isn't the best place to look.
###913 Finally, it's worth remembering that the big questions in science, whether Copernicus finding
###917 that the Earth goes around the sun or Darwin showing that natural selection drives biological
###922 evolution, were answered only after many measurements were taken compared against one another and
###927 hypotheses were proposed and tested against data. Only then can the big picture emerge
###933 and the theory get accepted.
###935 It'll be no different for Curiosity in its mission to understand the habitability of
###938 ancient Mars at Gale Crater. There won't be any single image or measurement that'll answer
###943 everything. We're in it for the long haul. But now we know that we have a fantastic rover,
###948 a great set of tools, and a fully functional scientific payload, so let's get on exploring.
