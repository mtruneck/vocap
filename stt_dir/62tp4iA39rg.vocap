###39 No one tells me what I can do.
###42 Especially you.
###44 -I traveled all this way to-- -I can have anything I want...
###49 and I want that diamond...
###51 the greatest diamond in all the universe.
###55 Let me try to explain this just once more, Your Highness.
###59 If anything happens to that diamond--
###62 I don't want to talk to you anymore.
###69 You are going to destroy everybody in the whole universe.
###73 -Take him away! -You will destroy yourself.
###77 You dare attack my power?
###83 You can stop me, but there are others.
###87 If only....
###90 Where is my horse? At least let me say goodbye to my horse.
###100 No one is going to stop me.
###170 It's spring!
###172 Spring! It's in the air.
###187 <i>Wake up, flowers</i>
###190 <i>I've been up for hours</i>
###194 <i>There's work to do</i>
###198 <i>Birds, start flyin'</i>
###201 <i>No more me-oh-myin'</i>
###205 <i>There's work to do</i>
###208 <i>Everybody's got a part to play</i>
###212 <i>To start each day in a beautiful way</i>
###216 <i>Every mornin' when the night goes away</i>
###219 <i>Every mornin' is a brand-new day</i>
###237 What do you take me for, the morning bus?
###243 <i>Even little things</i>
###246 <i>Need a helping wing</i>
###249 <i>There's work to do</i>
###264 <i>Sun, start glowin'</i>
###268 <i>Pack away your snow things</i>
###271 <i>There's work to do</i>
###275 <i>Up and at 'em</i>
###278 <i>You can't just hang around when</i>
###281 <i>There's work to do</i>
###289 <i>Everybody's got a part to play</i>
###292 <i>To start each day in a beautiful way</i>
###296 <i>Every mornin' when the night goes away</i>
###301 Good morning, Starlite.
###303 Good morning to you all.
###305 <i>Every mornin' is a brand-new day</i>
###328 That's my job.
###353 Good morning.
###354 <i>Mornin'</i>
###356 <i>Rainbow Brite</i>
###362 <i>Feel the sunlight</i>
###367 <i>There's work to do</i>
###369 Good morning, everyone.
###372 It's spring, Rainbow.
###376 I know, Twink. Thank you. Twink, the star sprinkles.
###391 Okay, let's get to work.
###395 <i>Everybody's got a part to play</i>
###398 <i>To start each day in a beautiful way</i>
###402 <i>Every mornin' when the night goes away</i>
###405 <i>Every mornin' is a rainbow day</i>
###411 <i>Every mornin' is a brand-new day</i>
###414 <i>And you've got a part to play</i>
###422 Come on, Starlite. Everyone on Earth is waiting for spring.
###426 We've got work to do.
###463 Oh, boy.
###467 Murky, hurry. It's almost spring.
###471 It's never going to be spring.
###478 One blast from my Super Gloom Boomer...
###481 and Rainbow Brite will never make anything beautiful again.
###485 Oh, boy. Then do I get to ride on her horsy?
###490 Murky, that smells terrible.
###494 Now, at last, I'll be the ruler of Rainbow Land.
###498 No more colors. Nothing but gloom everywhere.
###506 Get it, banana-brain!
###508 No.
###511 Get after it.
###515 Okay, Murky.
###523 I'm getting it, Murky.
###532 Don't worry, Murky. I'll get it.
###538 Come back here.
###547 No!
###554 Faster, snail-brain.
###562 Lurky!
###576 I wish we didn't have to go through this every spring.
###579 The Earth needs the winter rain, Twink. You know that.
###582 Everyone knows that.
###585 But I think they've had enough winter for this year.
###592 -Winter isn't over yet. -Stormy, it's time for spring.
###597 I'm having too much fun.
###609 Skydancer.
###619 It's time for spring, Stormy.
###624 Stormy, things have to happen when it's time.
###627 It's wintertime!
###638 -Come on, Starlite. Let's catch them. -My pleasure.
###651 You'll never catch us.
###654 There isn't a horse in the universe who can outrun the magnificent Starlite.
###662 Come on, Skydancer.
###663 If they catch us, winter's over for another year.
###672 Now it will be winter all year round.
###685 Come on, Skydancer.
###689 -See you in Rainbow Land. -See you.
###711 No more fun for three whole seasons.
###719 Long winter this year.
###734 Hi, what's up?
###742 Rainbow.
###744 I could never let anything happen...
###745 to the only person on Earth who can see me.
###748 Boy, it's about time you got here. Look at all this snow.
###751 Stormy got a little carried away this year. Twink?
###768 The rainbow didn't do anything.
###771 Maybe the star sprinkles are tired from the winter.
###774 They never got tired before. There's something wrong.
###778 If spring doesn't get started soon, flowers will die.
###782 The birds won't lay their eggs.
###784 And I don't want to think about the baseball season.
###787 Spring's when life comes back, when hope starts to grow again.
###791 All sorts of terrible things will happen if there isn't any spring.
###795 We'd better get back to Rainbow Land and see what happened.
###798 And fast.
###801 Spring will be here before you know it, Brian.
###803 -Come on, Starlite. -To Rainbow Land.
###806 I know where we have to go. Thank you very much.
###809 Goodbye, Rainbow.
###819 There's no place like home.
###822 Every place will be like home as soon as I get this machine fixed.
###830 -No. -Murky, you're dancing.
###836 Help me!
###839 I love dancing.
###842 Goody.
###852 -I'm coming, Murky. -No!
###856 Get off me.
###861 Murky, look.
###863 It's a shooting star.
###866 Haven't you ever seen a shooting star before?
###873 Never this close before.
###876 Lurky, come back here.
###883 Stay down. It may explode.
###887 -Go see what it is. -Okay, Murky. I'll go see what it is.
###895 It's a lot of smoke, Murky.
###897 Come back here, dodo-brain.
###907 A horsy! Take me for a ride.
###911 Get back here.
###914 Goody. Boy, I get to ride a horsy.
###920 <i>You are Rainbow Brite?</i>
###923 Me? No.
###925 You're looking for Rainbow Brite?
###929 <i>Yes.</i>
###932 I'm Rainbow Brite.
###934 Murky, I never knew.
###936 Not now, bozo-brain.
###942 <i>Not Rainbow Brite.</i>
###944 See, Murky? Horsies are smart. Can I have a ride now?
###950 <i>Not Rainbow Brite.</i>
###953 Just what do you want with Rainbow Brite?
###957 <i>Deliver message about diamond.</i>
###961 Diamond?
###964 It's right over that hill, my friend, in Rainbow Land.
###969 Murky, you're helping Rainbow Brite?
###973 I'm helping us, hairball.
###981 You tell her all about the diamond.
###988 Boy, I get to ride now.
###994 <i>Goodbye.</i>
###998 Hurry. We've got to get to Rainbow Land in time to hear that horse's message.
###1003 I'm hurrying, Murky. Boy.
###1009 Wait, Lurky. Wait for me.
###1014 No.
###1025 Am I hurrying enough for you, Murky?
###1037 A flying horse?
###1039 -Starlite. -Rainbow's back.
###1050 That's not Starlite.
###1057 -Who's he? -Where did he come from?
###1064 What does he want?
###1079 <i>Danger, rain....</i>
###1081 -Rain? -It's not raining.
###1085 <i>-Rainbow Brite.</i> -Here I am.
###1105 <i>Rain.... Danger.</i>
###1112 <i>Brite, I am On-X. Push button.</i>
###1120 Quick.
###1121 This'll let us hear the message, Murky?
###1124 If you stop talking long enough to let me listen.
###1130 <i>Danger.</i>
###1136 <i>Spectra's in danger.</i>
###1138 <i>Emergency.</i>
###1142 -What's a Spectra? -Spectra's the diamond planet.
###1146 All the light in the universe has to pass through it.
###1150 Boy, Murky, I bet it's shiny.
###1153 Not after I get done with it.
###1156 This is my chance to rid the universe of color forever.
###1160 Let's go.
###1161 Maybe we should hear the rest of the message. Maybe....
###1165 You come on, bubblehead.
###1168 You want them to beat us to that diamond?
###1176 If something's happened to that diamond....
###1178 That explains what's happening on Earth.
###1182 <i>The universe.... Danger.</i>
###1186 <i>The universe will die unless you hurry.</i>
###1191 <i>Orin says only hope is Rainbow Brite.</i>
###1195 Orin says? And just who is Orin?
###1198 <i>Wise one, ancient one.</i>
###1202 The only Orin I ever heard of...
###1204 is the one that Sprites tells stories about at bedtime.
###1207 But he's not real.
###1211 Yes, he is.
###1213 <i>Sent me to find Rainbow Brite.</i>
###1217 <i>The universe grows darker.</i>
###1221 I will go.
###1225 Rainbow.
###1229 Twink, you take care of Rainbow Land while I'm gone.
###1232 -Can I help, please? -Stormy.
###1235 I never get a chance to make things bright and colorful.
###1245 -Rainbow. -Rainbow, we need you here.
###1248 -It's spring. -Don't you understand?
###1251 Spring will never come again if something happens to Spectra.
###1258 I've never been there, but it's part of me.
###1262 It's part of the colors and the joy we bring.
###1265 And if Spectra dies, happiness everywhere will die.
###1269 Without the light of life, we'll all.... All of us will die.
###1278 Come on, Starlite. We haven't got a minute to lose.
###1284 -Goodbye, Rainbow. -Be careful.
###1293 And hurry, Rainbow. Please. Hurry.
###1306 Hurry up, molasses-brain, or we'll never catch up to them.
###1311 Yeah, I'm coming, Murky.
###1329 Done. That diamond's going to be mine.
###1339 Brakes, Lurky.
###1342 Yeah. Brakes.
###1345 Boy, I hope that wasn't the brakes.
###1351 -Yes. Those were the brakes. -You....
###1364 Let's see that Rainbow brat beat me this time.
###1376 Next stop, Spectra.
###1392 No.
###1393 -Murky. -Up. We want to go up.
###1406 The signal isn't going through.
###1409 -There's some kind of interference. -We have to keep trying.
###1437 -Starlite, look. -What a magnificent sight.
###1441 It really does shine with all the light in the universe.
###1446 But something's covering it up.
###1448 Look. Not all the light's getting through.
###1451 If we don't get it uncovered, everything on Earth will die.
###1475 You missed a spot.
###1483 You'll scratch it.
###1486 You have no idea how hard a job this is.
###1489 <i>Where is Orin?</i>
###1492 Never heard of him. My name--
###1494 I'm Bombo. Polisher first-class. This is....
###1502 -Oh, no. <i>-Must find Orin.</i>
###1505 No time to talk. Work to do.
###1507 Stop.
###1510 We worked all day on that spot.
###1513 There's the problem.
###1526 Why are they doing that?
###1528 I don't know. Not our job.
###1532 Just doing our job. Polish, polish, polish.
###1536 But they're shutting out the light.
###1538 Keep it bright and shiny.
###1541 <i>Hypnotized, no response.</i>
###1544 And the light of Spectra is the light of the universe.
###1548 With that net all over everything, the light can't get through.
###1552 <i>Princess plans to pull Spectra</i> <i>with spaceship.</i>
###1555 <i>Net is for spaceship to hold on to. Orin.</i>
###1559 No Orin.
###1561 <i>Krys?</i>
###1563 Bombo.
###1566 Popo, Bodo, Baglo, Bonglo, Beezo, his cousin Deezo...
###1570 Dazzo, Poonch, my brother, my sister, my nephew, and his friend.
###1574 No Orin.
###1577 <i>Krys?</i>
###1580 Things on Earth will die if you cover up the diamond.
###1584 Earth? What's Earth?
###1587 It's the place I bring color to, a beautiful place full of life.
###1592 But it can't live without Spectra's light. Who hypnotized them all?
###1597 -Not me. -Not our job.
###1600 We have to stop them before it's too late.
###1604 -Can't talk about it. -I'm tired of talking myself.
###1612 We can do it.
###1617 Glitterbots.
###1630 Starlite. No.
###1657 Hide. Hurry.
###1686 Glitterbot.
###1706 <i>No Orin, find Krys.</i>
###1709 -Krys? -Who's Krys?
###1712 <i>Friend.</i>
###1723 <i>Wait a minute.</i>
###1725 <i>Open.</i>
###1728 At last.
###1738 He's not here.
###1739 -But the Glitterbots are. -No.
###1742 <i>Emergency.</i>
###1746 Hurry.
###1802 -Starlite, quick. -I will not wear booties.
###1808 <i>Better than falling down.</i>
###1815 My poor dignity.
###1823 <i>-Find Orin now?</i> -Yes.
###1835 Boy, Murky, that's a big diamond.
###1838 What are we going to do with it?
###1840 We're going to crash into it, amoeba-brain.
###1845 Hang on.
###1847 No. The gloom pipe.
###1852 Stop. You're scratching it.
###1860 Now, how do we get the diamond onto the spaceship?
###1869 Look what you did, you....
###1873 I'll polish it later.
###1876 Murky, the Super Gloom Boomer's all ready.
###1881 Not yet, chicken-breath.
###1884 First, we're gonna find that Rainbow Brite...
###1886 and use it on her, whoever she is.
###1907 <i>Danger.</i>
###1924 Seems like the perfect moment for a swim. Hang on.
###1932 I can't get anywhere in this water.
###1936 Try.
###1940 I'm a magnificent swimmer.
###1942 We have to do something or we'll get hypnotized like the Spectrans.
###1957 Get in the boat.
###1959 It's a chance for you, at least.
###1964 -Hurry. -The boat won't hold me.
###1967 I won't leave you.
###1970 They're getting closer.
###1981 There are no oars.
###1984 And no sail.
###1986 There's no way to make the boat go.
###2015 I hope he knows where he's going.
###2018 Wherever we're going, it seems like we're going faster.
###2030 No!
###2048 <i>Emergency.</i>
###2054 The rainbow can't get through this mist.
###2070 -He saved us. -Now let's see if he knows how to land.
###2087 Well, we got away from the Glitterbots.
###2093 But now we've got to get back and do something about that net.
###2102 You think dropping a boat on me is gonna stop me...
###2105 you'd better think again. Maybe I'm the last one, but I'll fight.
###2110 <i>Krys.</i>
###2113 On-X. Where's Orin?
###2115 <i>Prison. Sent me for help.</i>
###2118 <i>-Rainbow Brite.</i> -Hi.
###2124 This is what you call help? A girl?
###2127 Orin's locked up someplace.
###2128 The Glitterbots have everybody on Spectra hypnotized but me...
###2132 and that's only because I can run faster than anybody.
###2135 The Princess is wrapping the planet up like a birthday present...
###2138 and you bring me a girl?
###2140 What princess?
###2142 The Princess. She wants to own Spectra.
###2146 Nobody can own Spectra. It's the life of the whole universe.
###2151 You go and tell the Princess that.
###2153 I guess I'll have to.
###2155 Sure. All by yourself?
###2158 Just tell me where to find her.
###2162 You can come with us if you're not afraid.
###2165 I'm braver than any girl.
###2204 Murky, how are we gonna get this whole planet in our spaceship--
###2212 Why don't you just go out and tell those robots where we are?
###2218 Okay, Murky.
###2220 Stop, rutabaga-brain!
###2223 Robots, we're over here.
###2228 Here they come, Murky.
###2231 Murky, look. A pretty rainbow.
###2235 There she goes.
###2239 There. Get after her.
###2241 We've got to stop her before she stops us.
###2267 <i>The weather bureau reports</i> <i>no sign of an end to the dreariness...</i>
###2271 <i>that's bringing the whole world to a stop.</i>
###2274 <i>The accident rate is up,</i> <i>the birth rate is down...</i>
###2276 <i>and every country in the world</i> <i>is blaming the whole situation...</i>
###2280 <i>on some other country.</i>
###2282 <i>Hospitals report their patients</i> <i>have stopped asking...</i>
###2285 <i>when they'll get better.</i>
###2286 <i>Things have become so depressing,</i> <i>in fact....</i>
###2290 <i>In fact, why am I even here?</i>
###2292 <i>Why should I be the only one</i> <i>who hasn't given up?</i>
###2303 When she gave it to me, Rainbow said never to use it...
###2305 except in a real emergency.
###2308 But this sure looks like it.
###2310 If we don't get the color back in the world soon, there won't be a world.
###2314 She said all I have to do was put it in any door...
###2318 and it'll take me to Rainbow Land.
###2325 Even the magic's given up.
###2332 Rainbow, help!
###2369 Intruders!
###2372 I didn't invite anybody.
###2380 Children. Children never bring good presents.
###2384 Never.
###2386 Get rid of them.
###2397 I don't like the look of this place.
###2403 Rainbow, we can't.
###2406 Go back if you want to.
###2409 I can do anything you can.
###2419 Girls.
###2421 We're almost there.
###2423 <i>Danger.</i>
###2425 I've got to help her.
###2446 This is fun.
###2450 We should have guests more often.
###2495 What do you seek here?
###2500 -We have to talk to the Princess. -Please?
###2503 No.
###2515 Come on!
###2516 This way!
###2517 I want that belt.
###2520 You even need somebody to tell you which way to run.
###2524 Some of us aren't used to running away.
###2530 Hurry.
###2543 No.
###2550 Hang on to me.
###2563 It's an elevator.
###2569 One of these has to take us where the Princess is.
###2573 Maybe it's a trap.
###2613 Come in.
###2615 The Princess has been looking forward to meeting you.
###2621 Where's my present?
###2627 How can you think of presents at a time like this?
###2631 That belt is fabulous. Take it off.
###2635 Come on, give it to me.
###2637 There are some things you can't have.
###2640 Don't yell.
###2642 You're frightening him. There, now, it's all right.
###2646 Everything's all right.
###2650 You have to leave Spectra alone.
###2653 Nobody says no to me.
###2665 I want the belt.
###2672 Stay.
###2681 No, Krys.
###2691 Got you.
###2697 It'll look marvelous with my red dress.
###2702 I don't ever want to see them again.
###2715 "And all we have to do is walk in and explain it all to the Princess."
###2719 How dumb can a girl get?
###2721 If you hadn't been in such a hurry to be a hero...
###2724 I'd still have my belt.
###2726 It doesn't matter much.
###2728 By the time we get out of here, the whole universe will be this dark.
###2733 We'll find a way. We have to keep believing, Krys.
###2736 I know everybody in Rainbow Land will be ready to help.
###2740 I know there won't be any trouble there.
###2746 Come on, Skydancer, we have to work faster.
###2750 More. Faster.
###2756 They've got the color console working.
###2763 Keep trying.
###2772 I've got to find a way to get out of here without the color belt.
###2776 We don't need any belt. We need a ladder.
###2780 There's a light.
###2784 -On-X. <i>-Greetings, Krys.</i>
###2789 You have to get us out of here.
###2791 <i>Oh, no.</i>
###2798 Somebody will hear him.
###2801 He'll never get in.
###2803 On-X, keep trying.
###2807 On-X, go and get Starlite.
###2811 <i>Starlite. Mission accepted.</i>
###2813 Tell him the Princess has the color belt.
###2819 A lot of good that's gonna do.
###2821 That dumb horse can't even fly without your rainbow.
###2824 He can think. Which is more than your horse can do.
###2832 I've got to get into that castle somehow and get that belt.
###2835 And you've got to make sure they don't see me.
###2837 You start flying around out there.
###2840 <i>Plan accepted.</i>
###2858 -Krys, look. -What?
###2860 He's back.
###2868 Who's making all that noise?
###2875 Fire.
###2885 Go away.
###2893 Get off the bed.
###2897 You better start listening to me, all of you.
###2914 There must be a stairway here somewhere.
###2936 Up.
###2939 Why am I the only one who can ever do anything around this place?
###2944 Meet me at the dungeon. I'm coming down.
###2953 If that tin horse doesn't give himself up...
###2956 his little friends get thrown off my balcony.
###2963 Another horse?
###2968 No horses in my room.
###2977 No horse is getting teeth marks on my belt.
###2985 I want my belt back.
###2996 Guards, to the dungeon.
###2999 Not you. You get that horse.
###3004 He's got the color belt.
###3009 Try, On-X.
###3014 We've got to find a way to get up there and get it from him.
###3032 <i>Danger!</i>
###3070 Bring my belt back here this minute!
###3073 You'll never get away with this.
###3078 You'll never, ever get away with this.
###3091 We've got to get that magic jewel. That's the only way to stop her.
###3096 I need more power.
###3097 We've got to get back to Rainbow Land and get more star sprinkle.
###3101 And we've got to hurry.
###3102 I hope that rainbow's still strong enough to get us there.
###3116 Banish them where they'll never bother me again.
###3126 <i>Danger.</i>
###3129 Rainbow! Watch out!
###3133 Faster, Starlite! We've got to get away from it.
###3153 Krys, get to Rainbow Land! Get help!
###3164 On-X, try.
###3182 Starlite, jump!
###3189 Oh, no!
###3213 Boy, what a ride.
###3216 -Where are we? -Wherever we are, I'm not staying.
###3223 Oh, no. Its power's used up.
###3235 I haven't lost all my power.
###3238 -Throw down that belt. -No.
###3243 -You'll stay up there till you do. -You can't keep us up here.
###3247 Prisoners don't talk back.
###3250 Sgt. Zombo reporting to the Princess.
###3254 If she ever wants to come down from there, Your Highness...
###3257 she'll give me the belt.
###3272 His name's not Starlite. His name's Crusader.
###3276 He's my horse now.
###3289 I'll get your horse back.
###3291 We'll get him back.
###3294 Come on, On-X.
###3299 <i>Obstacle.</i>
###3309 <i>Obstacle removed.</i>
###3321 New ones.
###3324 I remember when we tried to get away.
###3328 I can't remember that far back.
###3333 Help me, hopscotch-brain! Get me down.
###3338 We've got to find out where they put our spaceship.
###3341 I'll get you down, Murky.
###3344 I'm hurrying, Murky.
###3351 No. Put me down.
###3353 I don't see the spaceship anywhere, Murky.
###3357 Put me down.
###3362 Lurky, there's someone coming.
###3365 No.
###3389 Where did he go?
###3400 Yes, Your Highness?
###3403 Yes, Your Highness. The new prisoners have escaped.
###3412 Who said that?
###3422 -We'll never get in there. -lf you're too scared, stay here.
###3428 I'm not scared of anything.
###3445 <i>Danger.</i>
###3447 <i>Passenger too heavy.</i>
###3451 Get off my horse.
###3457 I'm coming, On-X!
###3464 <i>Over....</i>
###3489 <i>Overload.</i>
###3492 Oh, no!
###3581 There.
###3586 Star sprinkles.
###3613 This way.
###3623 No.
###3639 Watch out.
###3649 Can your rainbow get us up there?
###3652 The rainbow can take us anywhere.
###3661 Where did you get those star sprinkles?
###3664 Magic and I are old friends.
###3667 How did you know my name?
###3671 I sent my horse to fetch you.
###3674 -You're.... -Orin.
###3676 I heard the Princess sent you here.
###3679 I've been searching all over for.... But there's no time for chitchat now.
###3683 Spectra grows darker by the moment.
###3686 There is one thing we have to do first.
###3690 What could possibly be more important than saving the universe?
###3709 -Your power is his only chance. -And Starlite's.
###3713 I think the time has come for Krys to have this.
###3718 I knew you the two of you would meet one day.
###3720 Its magic has endured since the most ancient times.
###3726 He'll need the power of your rainbow to make it work.
###3729 But with your help, he'll be the warrior he's always dreamed of being.
###3734 If we can get it to him.
###3736 I'll get it to him.
###3755 Wipe that smile off your....
###3760 -Murky, look. -Stop her.
###3766 Rainbow!
###3774 Stand still.
###3779 Get out of the way.
###3782 Get away from there.
###3788 Put this on your wrist.
###3794 Out of the way.
###3796 Attention!
###3798 You.
###3804 -What does it do? -I forgot to ask.
###3818 Thanks, Rainbow.
###3832 How can they build a fort with only one gate?
###3842 Now we'll stop the Princess.
###3845 Let's go.
###3852 We caught them trying to escape, Your Highness.
###3857 They are not the ones I want. I want Rainbow Brite.
###3861 And her belt.
###3862 Not on my throne.
###3866 I know they don't have a present for me.
###3868 We do have a present for you, Your Highness.
###3873 You didn't have to.
###3876 We're going to give you Rainbow Brite.
###3879 You're going to do what all my forces couldn't do?
###3885 Your Highness, we've been fighting that Rainbow brat...
###3889 for years and years and years.
###3892 We know her weak spots.
###3895 Then why haven't you stopped her?
###3900 -Answer the question. -Why?
###3902 Because, Your Highness....
###3907 Because we were waiting until she led us...
###3910 to where she keeps all her belts.
###3913 She has more belts?
###3916 Dozens of them, Your Highness.
###3919 Go after her. Bring her back here.
###3922 Meanwhile, your spaceship will be bringing you Spectra.
###3926 I'll have everything.
###3929 I deserve everything.
###3940 Murky, how are we gonna catch Rainbow Brite?
###3944 We're not going to catch her, kangaroo-brain.
###3947 We're going after that diamond.
###3957 It's not Murky and Lurky I'm worried about.
###3960 It's the Princess' spaceship.
###3962 The only way to stop that ship from reaching Spectra...
###3966 is to destroy the source of its power.
###3968 The magic jewel?
###3970 The source of all her power. And she will use it all to stop you.
###3975 The castle's defenses are strong, but there is a way in.
###3980 A way so perilous that it is left unguarded.
###3985 A wheel turns at the foot of the tower.
###3988 If you're not afraid....
###3990 -I'm not. -I'm not afraid of anything.
###3993 You have the prism now.
###3996 -But how does it-- -Work?
###3998 Just as you saw. All you have to do is need it.
###4002 It will do its job as long as your purpose is true...
###4007 and the rainbow is near.
###4010 And I must do my job.
###4012 Spectra must be kept alive until you've destroyed the stone.
###4017 I'm afraid I'll have to borrow my horse.
###4020 Old On-X, trusty steed of noble voice.
###4025 You can ride with me on Starlite.
###4034 <i>Orin.</i>
###4037 And remember, the whole universe depends on you.
###4042 Be brave, be bold, and don't fight with each other.
###4066 I don't like the idea of you going up there without me.
###4070 I'll send the rainbow down for you as soon as it's safe to use it.
###4083 No.
###4089 Krys, jump.
###4098 Come on. Get it loaded.
###4101 They're not taking away any diamonds, are they?
###4105 No. Just worthless minerals, Your Highness.
###4108 The engines melt them and turn them into fuel.
###4112 Those spider legs...
###4113 will take hold of the net we've woven around Spectra.
###4116 The greatest diamond in the universe is almost yours.
###4122 Mine.
###4124 I've always loved the sound of that word.
###4139 -You broke it. -I didn't break it.
###4151 -Do you mind? -I didn't mean it.
###4157 -Can you swim? -Sure.
###4159 Good.
###4172 Why, at a moment like this...
###4174 is the most magnificent horse in the universe...
###4177 standing here doing nothing at all?
###4188 I want that ship on its way in one hour.
###4190 Less than an hour, Your Highness.
###4192 I do want that diamond.
###4207 Oh, no!
###4254 I don't know why they don't think keep horses in mind...
###4257 when they design a castle. Here goes.
###4280 -Spectra. -Orin.
###4283 Come on. He's doing his job. Let's do ours.
###4286 Let's get that jewel.
###4299 They never even noticed me. Nobody ever notices me.
###4304 Just hurry, my friend.
###4307 Talk a little less, work a little more.
###4311 I don't know how just the two of us are going to save the whole universe.
###4317 There are three more, but they should've been back by now.
###4321 I can't even see the Earth anymore.
###4338 She'll come through. I know she will.
###4342 You have to, Rainbow.
###4378 Come on.
###4382 Lurky, get back there and fix that engine.
###4385 Murky, look. Rainbow Land.
###4389 Goody, I get to sleep in my own bed tonight.
###4393 That's not Rainbow Land, alfalfa-breath.
###4397 That's....
###4402 It's....
###4412 My belt. You've brought it back.
###4415 -To stop you. -You're too late.
###4419 My spaceship is all ready to take off to bring my diamond home.
###4434 We can do it, Krys.
###4446 I need your power.
###4455 Now I've got you.
###4459 You stay right where you are.
###4483 Nobody touches that throne but me.
###4488 See, Murky? It is Rainbow Land.
###4492 Now, Krys.
###4494 No!
###4498 Stop!
###4506 No!
###4515 It's all right. I won't let them hurt you.
###4527 -We did it. -We won.
###4531 Not so fast.
###4534 Now I've got you right where I want you, Rainbow Brite.
###4546 See, Murky? I told you it was Rainbow Land.
###4569 Look.
###4574 You thought you stopped me? You little brats.
###4580 No. She's heading for Spectra.
###4584 We've got to stop her.
###4592 Hi, I'm Bombo. Polisher first-class.
###4596 What's all this?
###4598 He's not hypnotized anymore.
###4604 They all stopped.
###4613 -You did it. -What's that?
###4620 You can't stop me now. You can't!
###4626 Not now.
###4629 We can't be out of fuel now.
###4633 There must be something.
###4649 It's going to crash.
###4651 And this whole planet will shatter into a billion pieces.
###4660 If I can't have that diamond, no one's going to have it.
###4666 I always get my way in the end.
###4676 No, not the rainbow.
###4712 She did it!
###4730 Thanks, Rainbow.
###4745 See? Everything's fine.
###4754 Welcome to Rainbow Land, Krys.
###4764 Winter's a whole lot easier...
###4766 but I think next winter, I'm taking a vacation.
###4769 We'll all help fix things up.
###4779 We have time now. The universe is safe.
###4783 The universe is alive again. There's color, joy, and hope again.
###4788 And we'll keep it that way.
###4792 You'll need help, you know.
###4797 -You mean it? -He's your horse now.
###4805 We'll all work together.
###4807 And keep the universe bright and beautiful forever.
###4830 Maybe Rainbow Land is that way, Murky.
###4833 Or this way. Or maybe it's that.
