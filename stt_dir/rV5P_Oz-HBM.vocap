###3 Word up Food Tubers, Mister Oliver here. We have an incredible dish today. We're doing
###8 a beautiful, beautiful cured salmon with amazing marinated crushed beetroots, horseradish cream.
###15 This is the dish you want to cook for the girlfriend, the boyfriend, get the mother
###18 in law round. It's going to be super, super good.
###20 We've got some beautiful fresh salmon, that's 300 grams there. That's going to serve four
###25 people. Three heaped tablespoons of Malden sea salt
###30 goes in there. Most of that is going to come away but we need that salt to penetrate that
###35 fish to cure it. It gives you this sort of incredible waxy,
###38 delicate texture that allows you to slice it really thinly, easily and it looks and
###43 tastes amazing. So we want to add more flavour in there, brown
###46 sugar one heaped tablespoon like that. Lemon zest, orange, half of the zest. Then we're
###54 going to use dill. That, for later, but this part here, the stalks
###59 really sweet. Slice it up and that's all going to fall off so that's flavour for free, nothing
###66 in the bin. And then the secret ingredient. Some decent vodka. One shot.
###72 This is not traditional, right but it adds to the whole kind of flavour that we're after
###76 here. Massage up that lemon, vodka, sugar. What
###80 I want to do is pack that salt onto this salmon and put the other salmon on top.
###87 Get a bit of cling film and we're simply going to wrap it up super tight.
###93 Put that in the fridge, I do it in the morning by 12, 1 o'clock in the afternoon it's ready
###97 and raring to go. If you leave it a little bit longer it will get firmer and firmer and
###100 firmer. Nine hours is fine, but five hours is optimal.
###105 This is what it looks like after 5 hours. It's firmed up nicely. I'm actually just going
###109 to brush this salt off, normally in a gravadlax recipe you would to wash it off. You don't
###115 need to do that. We're going to use our dill. What I want to
###118 do is kind of create a little herby bark on the outside. Just finely chop it.
###125 Right, and then the fish goes straight into that. See how it just coats it beautifully?
###132 Absolutely gorgeous. This goes into the fridge until you need it.
###135 What I'm going to do now is show you how to make the beautiful horseradish sour cream
###140 and beautiful crushed marinated beetroots. So, so simple. Roughly, for four people. Two
###146 heaped tablespoons of soured cream, about two heaped teaspoons of horseradish, it's
###150 got to have attitude or otherwise why bother? Then half a lemon, do you remember the one
###155 I grated? Squeeze it, catch the seeds. A nice little pinch of salt. A little bit of quality
###160 extra virgin olive oil in there. One tablespoon. Mix it up.
###163 All you really need to do is taste it for seasoning and heat. Nice and hot makes your
###172 nose go a little whoo hoo! Next, beetroots, add a little bit of balsamic
###176 vinegar, nice pinch of salt, a little oil. I quite like crushing I like it being rustic.
###187 That is going to be joyful. I'm going to have a little clean up so you can fast forward!
###194 Okay, so missus is coming round, mother in law and the old man is coming round. If they
###199 turn up and you're hot and sweaty and look stressed. Not cool. Even if you're bad with
###203 knife skills you'll manage half or just over half a centimetre.
###208 It's nice and thin. It's almost you can see the light through it.
###211 You've got the herb there, you know it's fresh but it's lightly cured.
###215 Towards the end just kind of flare it out to take the salmon off because you don't want
###219 that skin. The second way of doing it.
###223 Take the end off, you're simply going to take your knife along the bottom of the salmon
###230 and that takes all the skin off in one. All of this you can do in advance. Okay so we've
###235 got that on the plate. Horseradish sour cream. Just going to do a little pile there.
###240 I love the way the beets just kind of bleed into the beautiful sour cream. You've got
###245 the salon. It's really, really nice dish. 1980's cress. A nice bit there, fresh dill.
###252 From a height just pick it off. Really nice. A little olive oil.
###257 Look at that absolutely gorgeous. If someone gives that to me I am so chuffed!
###264 Really, really good! So good!
###272 The salmon is lightly cured so it's got that lovely sort of waxyness that you get from
###276 things like smoked salmon and prosciutto and stuff like that really nice to eat.
###280 Beetroot's just sweet and gorgeous the heat of the horseradish. So good!
###284 So to go with this gorgeous dish for this lovely night out, how about a nice cocktail?
