0:0:5,736 --> 0:0:6,214
It's Thomas.


4
0:0:6,214 --> 0:0:7,648
We're in Arizona at the
Big Sandy Shoot Off.


5
0:0:7,648 --> 0:0:8,793
This guy's about to fire.

0:0:14,51 --> 0:0:15,508

0:0:15,508 --> 0:0:17,504
That was fucking insane.


9
0:0:17,504 --> 0:0:24,49



10
0:0:24,49 --> 0:0:28,58
Look out, and almost there.


11
0:0:28,58 --> 0:0:31,84
We are in an RV in the Sonora
desert, in Arizona.


12
0:0:31,84 --> 0:0:35,41
We're headed to a place called
Big Sandy, which is close to


13
0:0:35,41 --> 0:0:38,0
the Big Sandy Shoot Off, which
is an annual event where


14
0:0:38,0 --> 0:0:40,18
people with guns get together
and shoot their guns.


15
0:0:40,18 --> 0:0:43,81
Except their guns happen to be
anti-aircraft guns, heavy


16
0:0:43,81 --> 0:0:47,39
artillery, those kind of RoboCop
rifles that'll explode


17
0:0:47,39 --> 0:0:48,89

18
0:0:48,89 --> 0:0:54,5



19
0:0:54,5 --> 0:0:57,99
[MUSIC PLAYING]


20
0:0:57,99 --> 0:0:59,73
Hooah.


21
0:0:59,73 --> 0:1:2,94
So that was comfy.


22
0:1:2,94 --> 0:1:6,1
We are parked right next
to the gun line.


23
0:1:6,1 --> 0:1:8,11
Right now, the guys are out
there setting up the targets.


24
0:1:8,11 --> 0:1:10,53
There are just, like, steel
barrels, and then there's


25
0:1:10,53 --> 0:1:11,83
going to be model airplanes
flying around


26
0:1:11,83 --> 0:1:13,4
for people to shoot.


27
0:1:13,4 --> 0:1:14,782
Then they have these things
called reactive targets, which


28
0:1:14,782 --> 0:1:16,47
are basically just explosives
that you shoot,


29
0:1:16,47 --> 0:1:18,3
and they blow up.


30
0:1:18,3 --> 0:1:21,34
So fun stuff.


31
0:1:21,34 --> 0:1:23,27
How long did it take you
to find this place?


32
0:1:23,27 --> 0:1:26,785
KENTON: I got into my Jeep,
and literally covered the


33
0:1:26,785 --> 0:1:27,75
whole state of Arizona.


34
0:1:27,75 --> 0:1:29,55
Took me five years.


35
0:1:29,55 --> 0:1:33,225
I saw a lot of really
weird things, man.


36
0:1:33,225 --> 0:1:34,215

0:1:34,215 --> 0:1:34,71

up, and getting

their sun shades up.


40
0:1:38,67 --> 0:1:42,63
Setting up their guns, setting
up their tables.


41
0:1:42,63 --> 0:1:43,9
Gearing their ammo up.


42
0:1:43,9 --> 0:1:47,24
You'll find that their
all real friendly.


43
0:1:47,24 --> 0:1:48,8
How's everyone today?


44
0:1:48,8 --> 0:1:48,56
SHOOTER 2: Excellent.


45
0:1:48,56 --> 0:1:50,6
KENTON: Let's start shootin'.


46
0:1:50,6 --> 0:1:52,12
ED : This is not a militia.


47
0:1:52,12 --> 0:1:54,36
Most of them are professional
people.


48
0:1:54,36 --> 0:1:55,11
THOMAS MORTON: Yeah.


49
0:1:55,11 --> 0:1:55,72
So what you mean?


50
0:1:55,72 --> 0:1:57,1
Like, kind of like, doctors?


51
0:1:57,1 --> 0:2:0,21
ED : Doctors, and attorneys,
and these people are real


52
0:2:0,21 --> 0:2:2,14
dedicated collectors
and shooters.


53
0:2:2,14 --> 0:2:4,75
In order to own one of these
guns, it's such a pain in the


54
0:2:4,75 --> 0:2:8,259
hind end, you gotta really
want to do this.


55
0:2:8,259 --> 0:2:10,19
KENTON: Here's an anti-tank
round that went through, and


56
0:2:10,19 --> 0:2:11,56
that's pretty good size.


57
0:2:11,56 --> 0:2:12,465
THOMAS MORTON: Yeah.


58
0:2:12,465 --> 0:2:13,4
KENTON: That's pretty sharp.


59
0:2:13,4 --> 0:2:13,21
Be careful.


60
0:2:13,21 --> 0:2:14,54
THOMAS MORTON: This would
make a good picture.


61
0:2:14,54 --> 0:2:15,5
KENTON: This is hard steel.


62
0:2:15,5 --> 0:2:16,51
THOMAS MORTON: Yeah,
this is very thick.


63
0:2:16,51 --> 0:2:18,23
KENTON: Very hard.


64
0:2:18,23 --> 0:2:18,81
THOMAS MORTON: That is a--


65
0:2:18,81 --> 0:2:19,8
KENTON: It's just a flesh
wound [INAUDIBLE].


66
0:2:19,8 --> 0:2:22,6
THOMAS MORTON: --a bullet
hole there.


67
0:2:22,6 --> 0:2:23,52
KENTON: We'll put Bob up here.


68
0:2:23,52 --> 0:2:25,36
We're blowin' Bob
up, his ashes.


69

THOMAS MORTON: He's
just a friend?


70
0:2:25,74 --> 0:2:28,93
KENTON: Bob was an icon within
the firearms community.


71
0:2:28,93 --> 0:2:32,345
I was in charge of taking care
of him during his passing, and


72
0:2:32,345 --> 0:2:34,7
all his last 10 years.


73
0:2:34,7 --> 0:2:36,84
He is one who pushed us
to form this range.


74
0:2:36,84 --> 0:2:40,91
And Bob's wish was to be
blown up at the shoot,


75
0:2:40,91 --> 0:2:41,59
believe it or not.


76
0:2:41,59 --> 0:2:42,35
THOMAS MORTON: Yeah,
no I-- yeah.


77
0:2:42,35 --> 0:2:43,86
KENTON: We're going to blow
the crap out of him.


78
0:2:43,86 --> 0:2:46,975
That's what he wanted,
you know?


79
0:2:46,975 --> 0:2:48,13
It's kind of a unique way.


80
0:2:48,13 --> 0:2:49,44
THOMAS MORTON: It's a fitting
tribute, sounds like.


81
0:2:49,44 --> 0:2:50,9
KENTON: Yeah, we'd
blow you up, man.


82
0:2:50,9 --> 0:2:51,45
If you're good.


83
0:2:51,45 --> 0:2:51,926

few more [INAUDIBLE].

86
0:2:54,604 --> 0:3:0,3



87
0:3:0,3 --> 0:3:1,78
Lot of really old-looking
stuff--


88
0:3:1,78 --> 0:3:3,13
Gatling guns.


89
0:3:3,13 --> 0:3:5,6
Looks like water-cooled deals
that would, like, just mow


90
0:3:5,6 --> 0:3:10,5
down infantrymen in World War
I. It's an exciting array of


91
0:3:10,5 --> 0:3:11,575
death-dealers.


92
0:3:11,575 --> 0:3:15,18
You can murder a
lot of people.


93
0:3:15,18 --> 0:3:18,41
SHOOTER 3: Browning 1919, just
with the A-6 butt stock.


94
0:3:18,41 --> 0:3:19,675
That's probably my favorite.


95
0:3:19,675 --> 0:3:21,14
It's a reliable weapon.


96
0:3:21,14 --> 0:3:25,9
Rate of fire is slow, versus
the anti-aircraft guns at


97
0:3:25,9 --> 0:3:27,83
1,200-1,300 rounds a minute.


98
0:3:27,83 --> 0:3:28,888
Still fun though.


99
0:3:28,888 --> 0:3:31,31

it's a three-man operation.

one guy's loading.

0:3:32,94 --> 0:3:33,66

feeding that.


102
0:3:33,66 --> 0:3:35,57
And you have two barrels
on the other end?


103
0:3:35,57 --> 0:3:36,324

So far everybody's
super-friendly.

to explain their guns.

skew to the crowd.

four women.

But everybody's friendly.

their time to come out here
