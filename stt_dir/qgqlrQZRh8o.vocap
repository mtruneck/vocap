###1 NIMROD KAMER: Venice 2012.
###1 The 69th annual film festival.
###5 I had arrived in style to conduct an investigation.
###9 I had questions, like how can I get myself trending, make
###12 cash like Kim Kardashian?
###14 How can I become richer than producer Harvey Weinstein?
###19 I am the most favorite, a social climate disguised as a
###22 journalist, and this is my film--
###25 How to Make It #Huge in the Film Industry--
###29 and also get laid.
###30 
###34 Everyone knows the quickest way to get famous is to get
###37 sued for defamation.
###39 So I headed to Hotel Danieli and bumped into my old chum,
###42 Pierce Brosnan.
###43 I wanted to tell him all along about this ridic videotape I
###46 found on eBay.
###47 I said, about the sex tape.
###49 You and a girl, she's shouting,
###50 Daniel Craig, fuck me.
###52 PIERCE BROSNAN: Yeah?
###54 NIMROD KAMER: And I can sell it.
###55 I have one copy.
###56 I hear different girls keep talking to you as, like, the
###59 name of the guy you played.
###60 And they want someone else in bed.
###62 It keeps happening to me.
###64 I had only just arrived, and things were already starting
###66 to get a bit awk.
###68 I ran away until I found myself in Piazza San Marco and
###72 treated myself to a dessert.
###73 
###82 Next song, maybe, Cyndi Lauper, "Time After Time," if
###86 you have it?
###87 Cyndi Lauper.
###88 
###91 If you have it.
###93 Maybe, yeah, some--
###96 
###100 My life needed to be a bit more TMZ.
###104 So the next morning, I headed to the press room to spread
###106 rumors about myself.
###108 I have this interesting story to sell.
###113 It's about Selena Gomez, the Justin Bieber girlfriend?
###117 I sold her some MDMAC, some drugs.
###121 And so she bought my drugs, and I have some photos.
###124 I have a story about Ryan Reynolds, the celeb--
###129 the actor who is dating Blake Lively.
###130 I saw him having sex with another man.
###133 I'll sell you the story.
###135 I know the guy who was with him.
###138 I have some photos.
###141 And then I have some photos of me going down on her.
###145 Because I shot it like that, on the camera, when I go down.
###148 If you want later, it's 250 euros, just one photo--
###152 JPEG, 100k.
###153 Because I'm the guy who's with Ryan Reynolds.
###156 I spent a night with him, OK?
###159 
###163 I needed to raise enough money to buy 10,000 fake Twitter
###165 followers, so I went down to sell some drugs that I had
###168 stolen from Lindsay Lohan, aka LiLo.
###171 Do you want to buy some drugs, like MDMA?
###175 I've got some small drugs if you want, like--
###177 -Oh no, it's all right.
###179 NIMROD KAMER: I can give you a discount.
###181 -[LAUGH]
###182 NIMROD KAMER: Just to chillax, yeah.
###183 -OK.
###185 NIMROD KAMER: I found out Will-I-Am
###187 Defoe was staying nearby.
###189 I knew this would be an easy sell.
###190 How are you doing?
###191 WILLEM DEFOE: Hi there.
###192 NIMROD KAMER: I'm Mister Kamer, I'm
###192 Mr. Brosnan's agent.
###194 WILLEM DEFOE: Yes?
###195 NIMROD KAMER: And I just came to meet you.
###196 Just come by and say hi, yeah.
###197 WILLEM DEFOE: Ah, yeah, I didn't know anything about it.
###199 We were just taking a nap.
###200 NIMROD KAMER: Oh yeah?
###200 WILLEM DEFOE: And now we have to catch a boat.
###202 NIMROD KAMER: I'm his agent.
###203 And--
###203 WILLEM DEFOE: I see.
###204 I see.
###205 NIMROD KAMER: I can represent to you, as well, obviously.
###207 WILLEM DEFOE: Um--
###207 -We're going now to eat.
###210 We'll tell you what--
###210 WILLEM DEFOE: Now we have to catch--
###211 NIMROD KAMER: OK, and Pierce said to deliver you like this,
###213 if you want to just a small MDMSAG, if you want
###217 to, like, go ahead.
###218 If you want to try it.
###219 Whatever, yeah.
###220 He's downstairs.
###221 Cheers.
###222 
###228 I didn't want to be seen with Willem.
###229 He hasn't made a good film since Spider Man 3.
###232 So [INAUDIBLE]
###233 sisters shoved the whole bag of MDMAGCSC up my bum, and we
###237 got down to it.
###239 [MUSIC PLAYING]
