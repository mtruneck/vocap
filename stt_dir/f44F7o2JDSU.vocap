###8 FREDDY CORBIN: I always did art as a kid.
###12 I was the kid in school that would make the poster for
###14 brushing your teeth if the teacher
###16 asked me to or whatever.
###18 But I actually fell out of it for a little while.
###22 I'd pierce my ear and get called a fag.
###24 And my best friend was gay.
###27 So leaving high school was the best thing that ever happened
###29 to me because I got to be my own person and not have to
###33 deal with getting bullied and all that other stuff.
###37 So I started doing art a lot more once I
###40 had left high school.
###41 And I was really interested in punk rock, and I'd always
###44 wanted to move to San Francisco because I would come
###46 to Berkeley and Haight Street and was so turned on by it.
###51 I saw beautiful people.
###52 I saw European city style.
###58 I saw people that were liberal thinking.
###62 I saw freedom.
###64 
###67 So I always knew that I'd be here.

###71 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###83 TIM HENDRICKS: The first time I ever heard of Freddy Corbin,
###84 I was a kid, and I was just getting into tattooing.
###89 Breaking out in it and meeting some of the older guys.
###92 And there was this magazine write-up.
###95 And it said Mr. Niceguy right on the front.
###98 And I remember seeing it and being like, who's this little
###102 skinny guy?
###103 This guy kills it.
###106 Even before I got to know Freddy, if somebody asked me
###109 hey, I'm going up to the Bay Area, and I want to get a rad
###113 black and grey tattoo while I'm up there.
###115 I'd be like, well, you've got to go to Temple Tattoo and get
###118 tattooed by Freddy Corbin.
###119 He took what he knew from learning from these old
###122 schoolers and brought some black and grey twist on it.
###127 He made--
###127 I don't know man, he made a mark.
###130 It's hard to describe.
###131 It's not even really--
###133 like I said, it's Freddy Corbin style.
###136 JASON MCAFEE: I'd never seen anyone do a Day of the Dead
###138 skull until Freddy.
###140 When I saw one I was oh, it's those little, like, candy
###142 sugar skull things.
###143 As a tattoo?
###144 And I think he definitely brought that
###147 kind of style to tattooing.
###150 TIM HENDRICKS: That style of doing sugar skulls had been
###153 copied so many times that kids these days have no idea where
###156 it came from.
###157 FREDDY CORBIN: I mean I will say that I saw a painting of
###161 one that Malone did before I ever did one.
###164 So Malone probably had done one or two.
###167 And Scott Sylvia also was doing them simultaneously.
###172 So I think it would be safe to say, as egotistical as it
###176 might sound only because you asked the question, that Scott
###179 and I might have started the Day of the Dead thing.
###182 Greys, sugar skull greys, but who knows?
###186 I never got caught up in having a thing.
###189 I eventually got known for doing religious tattoos and
###192 stuff but I love doing lettering and
###194 black and grey tattoos.
###195 I love that whole East LA, Chicano look.
###199 I love old English next to Jesuses next to Guadalupes and
###203 big low rider cars.
###205 And I love that stuff.
###207 JASON MCAFEE: He does a lot of stuff that I love
###209 to watch him tattoo.
###211 I really, really like when he's about to start some big
###214 lettering thing.
###215 I don't think people really get what a craft that is to be
###218 able to do lettering that good.
###221 Watching him write something out, there's times when I'm
###224 like, dude, I'm having trouble with this name.
###226 Would you help me out?
###228 And in just one pass, he'll write the most beautiful name
###232 you've ever seen.
###233 He's just so good with it, it's unbelievable.
###238 FREDDY CORBIN: Basically, I was fortunate enough to work
###240 with a guy named Hollywood, Mark in Amsterdam.
###245 And he had gone to school with Cartoon.
###248 They had gone to graphic art school together.
###251 And he taught me a lot of tricks.
###253 JASON MCAFEE: I mean, there's probably so many kids and
###254 tattooers out there right now who don't even know who
###255 Freddy Corbin is.
###257 He was the young guy, but now he's become the older
###261 generation.
###262 He's been doing this for 27 years or something crazy.
###266 He is that guy now that people pay respect to and have love
###271 for and show it.
###273 FREDDY CORBIN: Back then you had to be half a cowboy to get
###277 into the business.
###279 Tattoo shops drew a weird type of folk, you know what I mean?
###284 And it was a weird type of folk that was drawn to
###287 tattooing, especially with the stigma behind it.
###290 So you were pretty much embracing an outcast culture.
###295 We were all outcasts.
###297 
###300 Do you want hop up?
###302 MALE SPEAKER 1: Yeah.
###303 FREDDY CORBIN: Let me look at them if you stand real
###307 natural, real straight.
###308 
###311 I think they look even.
###313 
###319 I always was trying to be a good tattooer.
###323 I look at tattooing like any trade.
###325 Like being a plumber or a shoemaker, or whatever.
###327 I just want to be good at it.
###329 I just want to own a shop that's going to be an
###332 institution of good tattooing so people can come and know
###335 that no matter who's working there that day, that they'll
###337 get a solid tattoo, they'll get treated with respect, and
###340 they'll leave happy.
###342 That's my goal.
###343 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###350 MAX SCHAAF: Freddy has two shops, Temple and 13.
###352 And Temple is the original one.
###355 And going to Temple is like, you walk in, and you're like,
###358 ooh, Temple.
###359 This is a place, this is gnarly.
###362 It's a cool place to be.
###363 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###380 FREDDY CORBIN: It took me a while.
###381 I had to postpone it a year.
###382 I tried opening up in '97.
###385 Couldn't get a place so I put it on hold and then came back.
###388 And then in '98 opened up Temple Tattoo.
###391 
###395 Now it's me, Heath Preheim, Jason McAfee, and Chummy
###401 Alexanian works there part time.
###404 Jason McAfee I met through tattooing him.
###408 He's a super solid dude.
###410 We clicked, and I asked him to come cover while I went to
###414 Japan that first Tokyo convention.
###416 JASON MCAFEE: And he randomly called me.
###418 And I almost had a heart attack in the shop.
###420 We all did.
###421 Me and Chops, and Kelly Krantz and all these guys were like,
###424 what the fuck?
###424 How come Freddy Corbin called you?
###426 I don't know, I met him once.
###427 And I was like, oh my god.
###429 Like it was meeting some famous rock star or something
###432 for me at that time because I was so
###434 obsessed with tattooing.
###435 And he gave me that for my birthday couple years ago,
###438 which is from a Tattoo Time book, it's the original.
###443 And it was a weird, emotional thing because I'd looked at
###448 that piece of flash forever and ever and ever
###450 since I was a kid.
###451 And then to be holding it and have it was like, oh my god.
###457 I got the Tattoo Time books, and that's how I first heard
###460 about Freddy Corbin.
###462 They're the old books that Ed used to put out
###463 on tattoos and stuff.
###465 And I was probably 16.
###467 I would look at them and see pictures of
###469 Freddy's tattoos in there.
###471 Something attracted me to the Freddy ones.
###473 He's also the first young dude.
###475 To see this young guy with all these old guys pop up and be
###480 this little ghetto Nick Cave kind of dude.
###483 Like cool hair, and he had diamonds in his teeth and
###486 Mexican style frames.
###488 MALE SPEAKER 2: Hey, how are you doing Freddy?
###491 Look at these.
###493 JASON MCAFEE: He was a sharp looking dude.
###495 He wore cool jean vests with Jesus on them, and he drove
###499 cool, old cars, and that just wasn't really happening.
###503 HEATH PREHEIM: That's one of those names, like when is the
###505 first time you heard Chevrolet?
###507 I think I heard these older, punker
###509 girls say Freddy Corbin.
###512 And it was one of those names when you heard it where you're
###514 like, man that's a cool name.
###515 That dude must be cool.
###518 And that's how it has been to this day
###522 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###538 HEATH PREHEIM: He's one of those dudes
###539 that has that thing.
###541 You or I might walk into the room and be like, did you hear
###544 I had a kid?
###545 Did you hear I got my face tattooed?
###547 Duke Freddy, he walks into the room and that's who he is.
###551 You have to be, has he always had that fucking
###553 tattoo on his face?
###556 He's fucking cool.
###558 TIM HENDRICKS: Especially today, you see all these
###560 people with face tattoos and neck tattoos.
###563 And it's like, oh, my indie band got signed.
###566 I'm only 21, but I'm going to get my neck tattooed.
###569 With Freddy, he's been around this for so long that he just
###573 wears it well.
###576 There's no one else that can wear a face
###578 tattoo like Freddy Corbin.
###580 HEATH PREHEIM: I never thought about it 'til right now, but I
###581 can't picture him as a kid.
###583 Like a 14-year-old or a 16-year-old in school reading
###587 Catcher in the Rye.
###589 He's always been slicked back hair, tattoos.
###593 How are you doing bro, hey bro.
###595 Bro is a gross word when most people say it, but when he
###598 says it, you're like ah, yeah, bro.
###600 JASON MCAFEE: Thanks for the birthday
###601 vacation, working here.
###602 FREDDY CORBIN: Oh, of course, you deserve it dude.
###603 I told him the smartest thing he did was fucking stay home.
###606 At home vacations are the way to go.
###608 JASON MCAFEE: It's been nice.
###610 HEATH PREHEIM: It's funny because Jason McAfee is one of
###613 my best friends.
###614 And I go by 13 every day.
###617 It's on my route.
###618 And Freddy lives by 13 so that's why I see him.
###624 [LAUGHING]
###624 FREDDY CORBIN: OK, yeah.
###626 Can I ask you how do you feel about this neighborhood being
###630 gentrified?
###632 MALE SPEAKER 3: We need more marijuana.
###633 FREDDY CORBIN: Oh yeah we do.
###634 I hear that brother.
###638 I say we never trust our government, sonny, never.
###642 Never get the chip, never trust the president.
###646 HEATH PREHEIM: 13 is a real fucking tattoo shop.
###649 Everyone's good that works there.
###651 But they're all fucking fuck-ups that
###654 tattoo, and it's rad.
###656 Freddy's smart enough to hire dudes that want to work.
###660 Dudes that like to party.
###661 Because I think that's important in tattooing.
###664 They used to have Friday the 13th parties,
###667 and you get $13 tattoos.
###671 Freddy did a 13 on my butt as a joke, but that's my only
###675 Freddy Corbin tattoo.
###677 I was drunk, and you leave there like, god, who's going
###681 to fucking clean this up?
###682 What's Freddy going to think?
###683 Freddy's going to walk in there and go, I've done that
###686 1,000 times bro.
###687 Did you guys have a good time?
###688 Hey next time, don't let someone sit on my chair.
###692 Or whatever, it's going to be that simple.
###695 FREDDY CORBIN: I'm not really their boss.
###698 I'm their friend, and I just happen to be their boss.
###702 It was a free for all for a while because like I was
###706 saying, we're all brothers so nobody wants to
###709 rat out their brother.
###711 And when it comes down to it, what I say goes.
###714 And they all give me that respect and they are all
###715 wonderful about that.
###717 It's almost like I've had to say OK, if you're not going to
###721 come in, you have to call me and tell me because no one's
###724 going to rat you out.
###726 I need to know what's going on.
###727 I'm not going to be mad, but I kinda gotta need to know
###730 because there's been times where someone will say oh, I
###734 want to go down--
###735 I'll go to send somebody up to 13 because we're busy.
###737 That's another reason why I opened is to be our own
###739 competition.
###741 Tattoo 13, it was a guerilla move.
###746 I knew that this neighborhood was going to blow up.
###748 And I knew that--
###750 I actually tried to open up in this neighborhood, but nobody
###752 would rent to me.
###753 I opened it up about a year and a half
###754 after I opened up Temple.
###757 It was premature.
###759 I knew that it was premature, but I went for it.
###762 And it worked out really well.
###764 I'm glad I didn't listen to anybody.
###765 OK, bye, you guys.
###767 
###770 HEATH PREHEIM: I mean, our economy is fucked right now,
###772 but they're tattooing every day there.
###774 Jason's got a kid and an ex-wife.
###777 And he's gotta handle his business and still party and
###781 have a good time.
###782 And he can do that working for Freddy.
###786 Freddy opened Temple 13 years ago.
###789 So Jason was there from the beginning.
###792 JASON MCAFEE: I've seen the shop go through so many insane
###795 changes, it's pretty nuts.
###799 Freddy was the first white guy on this whole block.
###801 When I first started working here, everyone
###802 thought I was him.
###805 I would go to the store, and they'd like Freddy, what's up?
###807 And I was like oh, I'm not Freddy.
###808 He popped up in the middle of this area and people were just
###811 like, what the fuck?
###812 Downtown Oakland used to be totally different.
###816 FREDDY CORBIN: This is actually after we had been
###817 open, and the windows got busted out from the protests
###819 from Oscar Grant getting shot.
###821 HEATH PREHEIM: I'd tell someone next to me on the
###823 airplane, I'm from Oakland. "Oh, god." That's what
###826 everyone thinks of Oakland.
###828 He could have opened a shop in San Francisco.
###831 Man, I get choked up thinking about him making that decision
###835 because Oakland means so much to me.
###839 But he chose to open a shop downtown.
###843 That neighborhood, when he did it, was way cutty.
###848 We'd skateboard there on weekends because there's no
###850 businesses down there.
###851 No one wants to be down there.
###852 There's no reason to be down there.
###855 FREDDY CORBIN: I don't want to say it was a huge ghetto, you
###857 know what I mean?
###858 But it was crack head heaven.
###862 So there isn't really a reason to come over,
###866 you know what I mean?
###869 But I've worked in so many low income areas and
###872 was cool with that.
###874 Plus I knew it made sense that with San Francisco blowing up
###879 the way it was, like Manhattan, people have to
###883 migrate east.
###887 HEATH PREHEIM: The weed places and all that shit are there
###890 now because of him or because someone had to pave the way.
###895 And Freddy was the dude that--
###898 it probably was the price, probably how the space was
###901 shaped, he knew he could fit everyone in there.
###903 But had enough foresight to say, this is the spot.
###910 FREDDY CORBIN: This is some early Temple, Temple Tattoo,
###912 Oakland tattooing.
###914 "Fuck the world, I'm a killer, you just don't know it yet."
###920 This was this little Crip kid that I had covered up BK on
###922 and put his family's name on him and stuff like that.
###926 Even though I'm not really into violence or whatever, I
###928 love that whole East LA gangster imagery.
###932 I've always been really, really attracted to it.
###934 And that's why I've always really liked working in places
###937 like Philly, or Oakland, or Sacramento, where there's a
###941 bunch of kids from the hood getting tattooed.
###943 I could do tattoos like that all day for weeks and not be
###947 bummed out about it at all, you know?
###952 Anywhere there's a low income area, you knew it.
###954 You'd do pit bulls, you'd do grim reapers.
###956 You'd do cash money maker, you'd do money signs.
###962 Fuck the world, the world with the fuck you finger
###965 busting out of it.
###967 Playboy bunny ring, shit like that.
###970 I think it's hilarious.
###972 I love doing it too.
###973 It's cool shit.
