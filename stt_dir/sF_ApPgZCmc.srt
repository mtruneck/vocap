0:0:0,15 --> 0:0:0,31
CHRIS GROSSO: Hi.


3
0:0:0,31 --> 0:0:1,26
My name is Chris Grosso.


4
0:0:1,26 --> 0:0:4,27
I'm a producer here at Vice.com
and the first show I


5
0:0:4,27 --> 0:0:5,95
ever got to work on was
Epicly Later'd.


6
0:0:5,95 --> 0:0:12,29
[MUSIC PLAYING]


7
0:0:12,29 --> 0:0:14,43
CHRIS GROSSO: So this episode of
Epicly Later'd is centered


8
0:0:14,43 --> 0:0:16,54
around Andrew Reynolds'
madness.


9
0:0:16,54 --> 0:0:20,74
Andrew Reynolds is obviously one
of the best skaters in the


10
0:0:20,74 --> 0:0:23,44
world and has been
for a long time.


11
0:0:23,44 --> 0:0:27,93
This episode focuses on him
trying to film a trick for


12
0:0:27,93 --> 0:0:31,72
what was then his upcoming
video Stay Gold.


13
0:0:31,72 --> 0:0:35,66
We actually have a doctor from
Columbia University in this


14
0:0:35,66 --> 0:0:40,22
episode and he explains what
the actual breakdown is for


15
0:0:40,22 --> 0:0:44,24
OCD, in particular, OCD
for a skateboarder.


16
0:0:44,24 --> 0:0:47,25
Vice presents Epicly Later'd
Andrew Reynolds' Madness.


17
0:0:47,25 --> 0:1:3,218



18
0:1:3,218 --> 0:1:34,94



19
0:1:34,94 --> 0:1:36,2
MALE SPEAKER: Neckface was
telling me he saw you try a


20
0:1:36,2 --> 0:1:38,13
trick and it was
hat nine times.


21
0:1:38,13 --> 0:1:38,995
ANDREW REYNOLDS: Nine, yeah.


22
0:1:38,995 --> 0:1:43,55
Like before I go to bed at night
I go to the door and I


23
0:1:43,55 --> 0:1:48,702
lock it nine times
but like 3,3,3.


24
0:1:48,702 --> 0:1:49,514
3,3,3.


25
0:1:49,514 --> 0:1:49,92
3,3,3.


26
0:1:49,92 --> 0:1:53,31
And I do that three times.


27
0:1:53,31 --> 0:1:54,78
And then sometimes I'm
laying down and I'm


28
0:1:54,78 --> 0:1:55,855
like, did I do it?


29
0:1:55,855 --> 0:1:56,89
And I go back.


30
0:1:56,89 --> 0:1:59,93
And then it's like once I did
that, then it has to be the


31
0:1:59,93 --> 0:2:2,2
nine, the whole thing, 3,3,3.


32
0:2:2,2 --> 0:2:2,424
3,3,3.


33
0:2:2,424 --> 0:2:3,268
3,3,3.


34
0:2:3,268 --> 0:2:6,44
Three times, and then if I
messed up and did it, then I


35
0:2:6,44 --> 0:2:8,69
have to do that whole
thing three times.


36
0:2:8,69 --> 0:2:11,31
You know what I mean?


37
0:2:11,31 --> 0:2:11,48
PATRICK O'DELL: All right.


38
0:2:11,48 --> 0:2:12,78
Welcome back to the show.


39
0:2:12,78 --> 0:2:16,12
This episode is about
Andrew Reynolds.


40
0:2:16,12 --> 0:2:19,35
I've said this about every guest
so far but Andrew really


41
0:2:19,35 --> 0:2:21,64
is the best skater.


42
0:2:21,64 --> 0:2:25,87
There's no one that can skate
big stuff like him as stylish


43
0:2:25,87 --> 0:2:27,41
as he does.


44
0:2:27,41 --> 0:2:32,38
He'll do an ollie inward
heelflip down all these stairs


45
0:2:32,38 --> 0:2:35,0
and it looks like flat-ground.


46
0:2:35,0 --> 0:2:38,41
This episode I went on a little
trip to San Francisco


47
0:2:38,41 --> 0:2:40,5
and I filmed him trying
to trick down


48
0:2:40,5 --> 0:2:41,52
the Wallenberg Four.


49
0:2:41,52 --> 0:2:44,71
Kind of what I wanted to focus
on was what he calls "madness"


50
0:2:44,71 --> 0:2:47,45
where he has to do all
these little rituals.


51
0:2:47,45 --> 0:2:52,57
It means a lot to me to have a
skater like Andrew talk to me


52
0:2:52,57 --> 0:2:56,1
and talk about these
weird tics he has.


53
0:2:56,1 --> 0:2:58,17
And that's what this episode's
about, it's


54
0:2:58,17 --> 0:2:59,42
just the madness episode.


55
0:2:59,42 --> 0:3:2,23



56
0:3:2,23 --> 0:3:5,134
I'm going to ask you just
what madness is?


57
0:3:5,134 --> 0:3:5,621
ANDREW REYNOLDS: All right.


58
0:3:5,621 --> 0:3:10,28
Well, it's basically obsessive
compulsive disorder.


59
0:3:10,28 --> 0:3:17,33
And it comes on really strong
when I'm doing tricks and I'm


60
0:3:17,33 --> 0:3:18,79
skating and I'm kind
of scared.


61
0:3:18,79 --> 0:3:21,725
I think it has something to do
with being scared or having


62
0:3:21,725 --> 0:3:23,72
some anxiety from having
to try the trick.


63
0:3:23,72 --> 0:3:26,22
Wherever you skate there's
cracks in the ground and


64
0:3:26,22 --> 0:3:28,86
there's signs and there's
people around.


65
0:3:28,86 --> 0:3:34,15
And pretty much it ends up being
this thing where I have


66
0:3:34,15 --> 0:3:37,605
to do three things
three times.


67
0:3:37,605 --> 0:3:42,46



68
0:3:42,46 --> 0:3:45,88
I do like three taps
a lot of times.


69
0:3:45,88 --> 0:3:49,623
It could start with just like,
[TAPPING], and then by the end


70
0:3:49,623 --> 0:3:51,4
it could be [TAPPING]


71
0:3:51,4 --> 0:3:55,3
that, and then like [TAPPING]


72
0:3:55,3 --> 0:3:58,47
that and then it could be three
taps and then it could


73
0:3:58,47 --> 0:4:0,91
be, Patrick, you ready?


74
0:4:0,91 --> 0:4:2,888
Tepa, ready?


75
0:4:2,888 --> 0:4:4,44
So and so, you ready?


76
0:4:4,44 --> 0:4:5,24
Back.


77
0:4:5,24 --> 0:4:6,32
Tepa, you ready?


78
0:4:6,32 --> 0:4:9,3
And then make sure the coast is
clear, there's no people,


79
0:4:9,3 --> 0:4:10,55
and then go.


80
0:4:10,55 --> 0:4:13,332



81
0:4:13,332 --> 0:4:15,712
[CHEERING]


82
0:4:15,712 --> 0:4:16,84
ANDREW REYNOLDS: I don't
know what it does.


83
0:4:16,84 --> 0:4:20,399
I don't even know why I do it
but for me, I think, why I do


84
0:4:20,399 --> 0:4:24,25
it is because I get all this
little bullshit stuff out of


85
0:4:24,25 --> 0:4:29,71
the way and then it's like I'm
clear to just go forward and


86
0:4:29,71 --> 0:4:31,92
jump down the thing.


87
0:4:31,92 --> 0:4:38,81



88
0:4:38,81 --> 0:4:41,28
MICHAEL MAHER: I know in
executing tricks and try like


89
0:4:41,28 --> 0:4:43,64
repeating them over and over
there's a certain amount of


90
0:4:43,64 --> 0:4:45,1
repetition that's
even necessary


91
0:4:45,1 --> 0:4:47,3
to be good at skating.


92
0:4:47,3 --> 0:4:49,69
I don't think anyone could make
an assessment based on


93
0:4:49,69 --> 0:4:55,22
watching someone's, say,
pre-trick ritual or behavior,


94
0:4:55,22 --> 0:4:57,3
whether they have a
disorder or not.


95
0:4:57,3 --> 0:5:0,52
Oh sure, it's interesting
because I grew up skating in a


96
0:5:0,52 --> 0:5:3,14
half-pipe in a friend's backyard
and stuff like that


97
0:5:3,14 --> 0:5:6,3
and even the way you hold the
board or start something or


98
0:5:6,3 --> 0:5:9,9
kick the board up like what
we're talking about, get's


99
0:5:9,9 --> 0:5:11,99
associated with pulling
off a trick right.


100
0:5:11,99 --> 0:5:15,96
I think they may even sort of
cue motor systems to sort of


101
0:5:15,96 --> 0:5:19,19
be on target and paying
attention to things that we're


102
0:5:19,19 --> 0:5:21,9
not so aware of.


103
0:5:21,9 --> 0:5:24,53
It may actually fine-tune our
ability to pull off some


104
0:5:24,53 --> 0:5:29,35
difficult tricks or difficult
maneuvers.


105
0:5:29,35 --> 0:5:31,34
KEVIN "SPANKY" LONG: I've had
this theory that with


106
0:5:31,34 --> 0:5:37,0
skateboarding, with the madness,
it's so hard to clear


107
0:5:37,0 --> 0:5:40,36
your mind when you're about to
try a trick and if you're


108
0:5:40,36 --> 0:5:44,51
focusing on little stupid things
like tapping or walking


109
0:5:44,51 --> 0:5:48,32
up the stairs a certain way, it
kind of clears your mind.


110
0:5:48,32 --> 0:5:50,46
And you're like, OK,
I did that right.


111
0:5:50,46 --> 0:5:53,21
I got it.


112
0:5:53,21 --> 0:5:55,24
ANDREW REYNOLDS: I mean, it's
like I know people where OCD


113
0:5:55,24 --> 0:5:59,6
has came and pretty much fucked
up their whole life and


114
0:5:59,6 --> 0:6:0,8
they can't do anything.


115
0:6:0,8 --> 0:6:5,6
They can but they need meds
and it's all fucked up.


116
0:6:5,6 --> 0:6:9,51
And I realized it at one point,
I have this and I do it


117
0:6:9,51 --> 0:6:10,97
and I know I do it.


118
0:6:10,97 --> 0:6:14,704
And I just thought to myself,
well, it's worked this long I


119
0:6:14,704 --> 0:6:15,292
might as well keep doing it.


120
0:6:15,292 --> 0:6:16,92
PATRICK O'DELL: Yeah.

can't stop it.

film your back one more time?

Did you have madness
that time?

0:6:42,9 --> 0:6:44,23

134
0:6:44,23 --> 0:6:46,4
It was a lot of variations,
though.

139
0:6:53,62 --> 0:6:54,95

works though.

complaints about it because I


142
0:6:57,51 --> 0:6:58,735
got my trick.

yeah, yeah.

it does if you tap


145
0:7:0,67 --> 0:7:1,39
the wall three times?


146
0:7:1,39 --> 0:7:4,28
He gets a chance to backstep
at Wallenberg.


147
0:7:4,28 --> 0:7:5,53
Like that.

in Victorville that I really


150

0:7:19,51 --> 0:7:21,1

157
0:7:21,1 --> 0:7:22,585
All in the legs until
he can't get up.

0:7:22,585 --> 0:7:23,99
He'll be doing it forever.
