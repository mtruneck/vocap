0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:7,3



2
0:0:7,3 --> 0:0:8,7
STEVE RODRIGUEZ: My favorite
thing is skating down the


3
0:0:8,7 --> 0:0:9,65
street, you know what I mean?


4
0:0:9,65 --> 0:0:11,45
Just hitting things random
here and there.


5
0:0:11,45 --> 0:0:13,83
If the spots are like 23rd
Street, it's like, why are you


6
0:0:13,83 --> 0:0:15,24
going to drive there?


7
0:0:15,24 --> 0:0:17,64
The best part is skating
to the spot.


8
0:0:17,64 --> 0:0:21,23
At any given time, you'll
be skating,


9
0:0:21,23 --> 0:0:22,7
and it's always different.


10
0:0:22,7 --> 0:0:26,4
It's just completely random
chaos what's going on.


11
0:0:26,4 --> 0:0:28,45
And you're just meshing
with that environment.


12
0:0:28,45 --> 0:0:31,6
It's just such a spontaneous
experience,


13
0:0:31,6 --> 0:0:33,32
skating in the city.


14
0:0:33,32 --> 0:0:33,99
It's that old saying.


15
0:0:33,99 --> 0:0:35,17
It's not the destination.


16
0:0:35,17 --> 0:0:35,8
It's the journey.


17
0:0:35,8 --> 0:0:38,84
It's like totally true.


18
0:0:38,84 --> 0:0:40,61
O'Dell, one of the best spots.


19
0:0:40,61 --> 0:0:42,51
Come on, stay with me.


20
0:0:42,51 --> 0:0:44,9
Come come, come.


21
0:0:44,9 --> 0:0:45,34
Follow me, fast.


22
0:0:45,34 --> 0:0:51,92



23
0:0:51,92 --> 0:0:53,58
PATRICK O'DELL: I will come back
to "Epicly Later'd." This


24
0:0:53,58 --> 0:0:55,51
show is about Steve Rodriguez.


25
0:0:55,51 --> 0:0:59,62
Steve is one of those die-hard
skaters I've ever come across


26
0:0:59,62 --> 0:1:0,78
in my entire life.


27
0:1:0,78 --> 0:1:4,39
And to me, he is exactly the
kind of person that you want


28
0:1:4,39 --> 0:1:6,83
to be owning skateboard
companies.


29
0:1:6,83 --> 0:1:8,96
So Steve Rodriguez,
he runs 5boro.


30
0:1:8,96 --> 0:1:9,85
It's a small company.


31
0:1:9,85 --> 0:1:10,95
They don't run ads.


32
0:1:10,95 --> 0:1:12,91
They're independently owned.


33
0:1:12,91 --> 0:1:16,355
But they've made such a big name
for themselves just on


34
0:1:16,355 --> 0:1:20,77
the grassroots level by always
having the best local skaters,


35
0:1:20,77 --> 0:1:22,87
and the best up and
coming people.


36
0:1:22,87 --> 0:1:25,735
Over time, his team has had some
of the biggest names in


37
0:1:25,735 --> 0:1:26,92
the East Coast.


38
0:1:26,92 --> 0:1:28,745
5boro's a company that's just
about skateboarding.


39
0:1:28,745 --> 0:1:30,335
He's just in it for
the right reasons.


40
0:1:30,335 --> 0:1:33,1



41
0:1:33,1 --> 0:1:35,72
STEVE RODRIGUEZ: I've been
skating since around 1983.


42
0:1:35,72 --> 0:1:37,28
I moved to New York.


43
0:1:37,28 --> 0:1:38,96
And I've been here since.


44
0:1:38,96 --> 0:1:41,8
I've been doing 5boro
11 years.


45
0:1:41,8 --> 0:1:44,37
I came up with the idea to--


46
0:1:44,37 --> 0:1:45,21
I want to make a company.


47
0:1:45,21 --> 0:1:49,7
I want to make a company that
represents what we're about.


48
0:1:49,7 --> 0:1:54,4
It's just a totally different
structure of a company.


49
0:1:54,4 --> 0:1:59,87
Like I'd say, 25% of 5boro's job
is working with the City


50
0:1:59,87 --> 0:2:2,59
of New York to make sure that
skateboarding is represented


51
0:2:2,59 --> 0:2:5,84
well in New York City, dealing
with parks and places to


52
0:2:5,84 --> 0:2:7,2
skate, things like that.


53
0:2:7,2 --> 0:2:11,89
So it's more than just a company
that makes boards.


54
0:2:11,89 --> 0:2:16,39
The city, two years ago, the
city wanted to renovate all


55
0:2:16,39 --> 0:2:17,26
downtown parks.


56
0:2:17,26 --> 0:2:18,73
And this is one of the
parks downtown.


57
0:2:18,73 --> 0:2:21,15
They said, because a lot of
kids skate here, the only


58
0:2:21,15 --> 0:2:23,34
skate area was actually going
to be this pathway


59
0:2:23,34 --> 0:2:24,8
right here on top.


60
0:2:24,8 --> 0:2:24,95
That's it.


61
0:2:24,95 --> 0:2:27,25
So everything else was going
to be taken out.


62
0:2:27,25 --> 0:2:30,49
We got involved, went to the
council meetings, talked to


63
0:2:30,49 --> 0:2:34,4
the people and said, they're
bitching how stuff's going to


64
0:2:34,4 --> 0:2:35,98
cost so much money, this and
that, and the other thing.


65
0:2:35,98 --> 0:2:38,49
And you guys know no one
would hang out down


66
0:2:38,49 --> 0:2:39,74
here besides skaters.


67
0:2:39,74 --> 0:2:40,81
Because it's under a bridge.


68
0:2:40,81 --> 0:2:42,5
It's dirty, blah, blah, blah.


69
0:2:42,5 --> 0:2:46,29
The city, two years ago, the
city wanted to renovate all


70
0:2:46,29 --> 0:2:47,6
downtown parks.


71
0:2:47,6 --> 0:2:51,38
So they said, OK, well,
we're going to take


72
0:2:51,38 --> 0:2:52,565
out the little banks.


73
0:2:52,565 --> 0:2:53,5
And it sucks.


74
0:2:53,5 --> 0:2:55,85
Because that's where all history
really is about, the


75
0:2:55,85 --> 0:2:56,73
Brooklyn banks.


76
0:2:56,73 --> 0:2:58,14
It's at the small banks.


77
0:2:58,14 --> 0:2:59,42
And I don't know.


78
0:2:59,42 --> 0:3:1,8
I mean, this area's fun.


79
0:3:1,8 --> 0:3:3,51
But if you've ever skated
over there, it was sick.


80
0:3:3,51 --> 0:3:5,79
Because it was a hip, like
a wave, not a flat bank.


81
0:3:5,79 --> 0:3:11,48



82
0:3:11,48 --> 0:3:15,45
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, my God,
I'm fucking perfect.


83
0:3:15,45 --> 0:3:17,57
STEVE RODRIGUEZ: If you're
just in New York City,


84
0:3:17,57 --> 0:3:19,64
everybody has to go to the
banks or whatever.


85
0:3:19,64 --> 0:3:23,77
Because you would definitely
go to EMB, if it was still


86
0:3:23,77 --> 0:3:26,68
there, even if you couldn't
skate there.


87
0:3:26,68 --> 0:3:28,7
Because I remember going there
when you couldn't skate there.


88
0:3:28,7 --> 0:3:29,84
And you'd just see people
there anyway.


89
0:3:29,84 --> 0:3:32,15
Because it's EMB, you
know what I mean?


90
0:3:32,15 --> 0:3:34,29
A lot of kids, oh, I want to go
to Love Park, even though


91
0:3:34,29 --> 0:3:36,66
they know they probably won't
be able to skate there--


92
0:3:36,66 --> 0:3:40,44
Freedom Plaza, Pulaski in D.C.
There's all these holy grail


93
0:3:40,44 --> 0:3:43,78
places that you're just going
to go because it's history.


94
0:3:43,78 --> 0:3:46,7
It's like going to see the
pyramids, if you're a tourist


95
0:3:46,7 --> 0:3:47,56
or whatever, and you
go to Egypt.


96
0:3:47,56 --> 0:3:48,81
It's something you
have to see.


97
0:3:48,81 --> 0:4:6,63



98
0:4:6,63 --> 0:4:10,14
This is the Harold thing where
I remember seeing Harold


99
0:4:10,14 --> 0:4:13,93
skating here, hauling over
this black rail, off this


100
0:4:13,93 --> 0:4:15,79
thing, down to the bottom.


101
0:4:15,79 --> 0:4:19,45
I could swear he was doing
it for money once.


102
0:4:19,45 --> 0:4:22,4
Just joking around, but at the
same time taking the money.


103
0:4:22,4 --> 0:4:24,9
But there used to be a guy that
would jump the garbage


104
0:4:24,9 --> 0:4:28,8
cans here, back when they
were the wire mesh.


105
0:4:28,8 --> 0:4:29,31
That's pretty sick.


106
0:4:29,31 --> 0:4:31,36
I mean, that's like one of the
first things, like that's when


107
0:4:31,36 --> 0:4:33,24
I was like 10 years
old or whatever.


108
0:4:33,24 --> 0:4:35,32
Seeing that shit, and you're
just like damn.


109
0:4:35,32 --> 0:4:40,35
But this was a super--


110
0:4:40,35 --> 0:4:43,14
I'd say, late '80s,
early '90s--


111
0:4:43,14 --> 0:4:45,14
people would skate this
area right here.


112
0:4:45,14 --> 0:4:49,5
I don't know, this was like a,
for a minute, this was--


113
0:4:49,5 --> 0:4:52,33
I don't know, for a good like
three years probably or more,


114
0:4:52,33 --> 0:4:54,6
everybody used to stay
here, these ledges.


115
0:4:54,6 --> 0:4:55,42
These were actually-- you
could skate them.


116
0:4:55,42 --> 0:4:58,52
They're like so chunked now.


117
0:4:58,52 --> 0:5:0,42
I just remember coming into
the city seeing so


118
0:5:0,42 --> 0:5:1,18
much shit go down.


119
0:5:1,18 --> 0:5:2,13
This is actually--


120
0:5:2,13 --> 0:5:4,55
I met Gonz right there.


121
0:5:4,55 --> 0:5:7,89
This is the first place I
ever met Mark Gonzales.


122
0:5:7,89 --> 0:5:10,52
I remember we were just skating
down Fifth Avenue.


123
0:5:10,52 --> 0:5:11,45
And there was--


124
0:5:11,45 --> 0:5:12,72
it was more crowded
than today.


125
0:5:12,72 --> 0:5:14,59
There was some event going on.


126
0:5:14,59 --> 0:5:16,59
And just seeing him skate
right here was--


127
0:5:16,59 --> 0:5:17,925
you're just so blown away.


128
0:5:17,925 --> 0:5:19,273
You're like fuck, that's
Mark Gonzales.


129
0:5:19,273 --> 0:5:22,73



130
0:5:22,73 --> 0:5:24,37
Look at this shit.


131
0:5:24,37 --> 0:5:27,69
I know someone's ollied
into this.


132
0:5:27,69 --> 0:5:29,41
I think front-side 180,
but I think there's


133
0:5:29,41 --> 0:5:30,3
was a back-side 180--


134
0:5:30,3 --> 0:5:32,59
Grosso will probably know--
into the fountain.


135
0:5:32,59 --> 0:5:35,11
That's pretty sick.


136
0:5:35,11 --> 0:5:38,77
Even by today's standards,
that's sick.


137
0:5:38,77 --> 0:5:41,92
Actually when Lenny Kirk and
Anthony Correa came to New


138
0:5:41,92 --> 0:5:45,94
York, I remember taking
them around to spots.


139
0:5:45,94 --> 0:5:49,3
And those two just like
seriously, like destroying


140
0:5:49,3 --> 0:5:50,55
everything.


141
0:5:50,55 --> 0:5:52,21



142
0:5:52,21 --> 0:5:54,7
This shit's fun, dude.


143
0:5:54,7 --> 0:5:55,32
And you could tell us
it's skated because


144
0:5:55,32 --> 0:5:57,722
look it's fresh paint.


145
0:5:57,722 --> 0:5:58,81
See, look, see.


146
0:5:58,81 --> 0:6:2,19
Get the security guy.


147
0:6:2,19 --> 0:6:4,133
You mean we really can't
skateboard here.


148
0:6:4,133 --> 0:6:5,4
[INAUDIBLE]


149
0:6:5,4 --> 0:6:7,72
STEVE RODRIGUEZ: Ah,
I'm bummed, man.


150
0:6:7,72 --> 0:6:10,12
I came all the way
from New Jersey.


151
0:6:10,12 --> 0:6:13,87
Anyway, this is a fuckin'
sick spot.


152
0:6:13,87 --> 0:6:14,28
And I don't know.


153
0:6:14,28 --> 0:6:15,16
That guy's not there at night.


154
0:6:15,16 --> 0:6:17,84
I don't usually come
here this early.


155
0:6:17,84 --> 0:6:21,6
But just front-boarding this
whole thing, or trying to


156
0:6:21,6 --> 0:6:22,44
front-board the whole
thing, it's sick.


157
0:6:22,44 --> 0:6:23,86
There's a new sidewalk.


158
0:6:23,86 --> 0:6:25,91
I know when Harold did this
shit, when he 50-50'ed it--


159
0:6:25,91 --> 0:6:27,31
which is pretty sick,
because if you flip


160
0:6:27,31 --> 0:6:29,13
over, you get killed.


161
0:6:29,13 --> 0:6:30,985
But the sidewalk was rough.


162
0:6:30,985 --> 0:6:32,235
It was like that.


163
0:6:32,235 --> 0:6:37,31



164
0:6:37,31 --> 0:6:40,146
Yo, I've never seen footage of
someone doing this this way.


165
0:6:40,146 --> 0:6:40,552
Have you?


166
0:6:40,552 --> 0:6:41,364
PATRICK O'DELL: You
mean, over?


167
0:6:41,364 --> 0:6:42,16
STEVE RODRIGUEZ:
Yeah, this way?


168
0:6:42,16 --> 0:6:43,16
No.


169
0:6:43,16 --> 0:6:46,57
But I either saw it in person
or saw it in a video.


170
0:6:46,57 --> 0:6:49,6
Someone ollied from
here into there--


171
0:6:49,6 --> 0:6:49,7
Anthony Correa.


172
0:6:49,7 --> 0:6:50,8
That's sick.


173
0:6:50,8 --> 0:6:51,48
Get up here, O'Dell.


174
0:6:51,48 --> 0:6:52,23
Check this out.


175
0:6:52,23 --> 0:6:56,11
Yo, but he ollied from
here into that shit.


176
0:6:56,11 --> 0:6:59,69
That's asking for some fuckin'
teeth, fuckin' to be removed.


177
0:6:59,69 --> 0:7:1,72
This is fuckin' sketchy.


178
0:7:1,72 --> 0:7:3,9
You want to check out the
other gap over there?


179
0:7:3,9 --> 0:7:6,31



180
0:7:6,31 --> 0:7:6,86
I don't, dude.


181
0:7:6,86 --> 0:7:9,1
This fuckin' ground
is so shitty.


182
0:7:9,1 --> 0:7:9,63
It's pretty sick.


183
0:7:9,63 --> 0:7:10,1
But, you know what I mean?


184
0:7:10,1 --> 0:7:12,9
It's just another one of those
spots where it's just because


185
0:7:12,9 --> 0:7:13,2
of the way it's set up.


186
0:7:13,2 --> 0:7:14,69
It looks cool.


187
0:7:14,69 --> 0:7:16,546
Whatever, this is sick.


188
0:7:16,546 --> 0:7:18,15
I don't think I ever
ollied this.


189
0:7:18,15 --> 0:7:19,4
And I don't think I ever will.


190
0:7:19,4 --> 0:7:22,5



191
0:7:22,5 --> 0:7:23,35
So we're all old.


192
0:7:23,35 --> 0:7:24,715
We don't just jump down.


193
0:7:24,715 --> 0:7:25,965
Take the stairs.


194
0:7:25,965 --> 0:7:37,36



195
0:7:37,36 --> 0:7:38,61
So weird.


196
0:7:38,61 --> 0:7:40,59



197
0:7:40,59 --> 0:7:41,94
Yo, O'Dell, I hope
you got that guy.


198
0:7:41,94 --> 0:7:44,766



199
0:7:44,766 --> 0:7:46,18
Damn.


200
0:7:46,18 --> 0:7:46,76
So I don't know.


201
0:7:46,76 --> 0:7:48,81
So this is Union Square.


202
0:7:48,81 --> 0:7:51,935
There was like a time when Union
Square was a place to


203
0:7:51,935 --> 0:7:54,79
skate, two sets of steps here.


204
0:7:54,79 --> 0:7:56,31
I remember my board--


205
0:7:56,31 --> 0:7:57,72
trying to front side 360.


206
0:7:57,72 --> 0:7:59,57
And my board smacking
me in the face so


207
0:7:59,57 --> 0:8:1,0
hard, it made a hole.


208
0:8:1,0 --> 0:8:3,9
Like I actually had to
get stitches to close


209
0:8:3,9 --> 0:8:4,74
a hole right here.


210
0:8:4,74 --> 0:8:7,72
And back then it wasn't
like now nowadays.


211
0:8:7,72 --> 0:8:11,23
You never come and well, let's
skate these steps.


212
0:8:11,23 --> 0:8:13,81
This shit was so waxed up.


213
0:8:13,81 --> 0:8:19,89
And it was one of the only
curves, like little curves.


214
0:8:19,89 --> 0:8:24,75
John Carter doing slappies on
this just like super Hamilton.


215
0:8:24,75 --> 0:8:27,16
Like all those guys that roll
through here skate this stuff.


216
0:8:27,16 --> 0:8:31,51
You'd see people actually
grind both like this.


217
0:8:31,51 --> 0:8:31,83
I don't know.


218
0:8:31,83 --> 0:8:34,28
This place was fun, dude.


219
0:8:34,28 --> 0:8:36,549
Over here, O'Dell.


220
0:8:36,549 --> 0:8:38,25
So you want to talk about
Burton Smith's


221
0:8:38,25 --> 0:8:40,58
destruction of this?


222
0:8:40,58 --> 0:8:43,35
This is like 32 inches high.


223
0:8:43,35 --> 0:8:45,24
The ground was smooth,
whatever.


224
0:8:45,24 --> 0:8:46,35
But it's still stick.


225
0:8:46,35 --> 0:8:49,89
I think he fakey ollied it this,
half cabbed it, maybe


226
0:8:49,89 --> 0:8:51,86
switch 180'ed.


227
0:8:51,86 --> 0:8:53,9
He might have even pop
shoveled this.


228
0:8:53,9 --> 0:8:54,31
He's so good.


229
0:8:54,31 --> 0:8:58,53
That kid was like killing
it at that time.


230
0:8:58,53 --> 0:8:59,43
And I know Gangemi--


231
0:8:59,43 --> 0:9:0,68
should we go to the
other side?


232
0:9:0,68 --> 0:9:6,14



233
0:9:6,14 --> 0:9:9,1
But you know the famous
Robb Gangemi?


234
0:9:9,1 --> 0:9:12,73
He board slid this shit over
these little nipples.


235
0:9:12,73 --> 0:9:13,886
It's very sick.


236
0:9:13,886 --> 0:9:18,83
So actually the most spot for
advanced people was over here,


237
0:9:18,83 --> 0:9:19,75
this round ledge.


238
0:9:19,75 --> 0:9:21,6
You remember skating this
shit back here?


239
0:9:21,6 --> 0:9:24,4



240
0:9:24,4 --> 0:9:26,59
Anyway, this was sick,
this ledge, this


241
0:9:26,59 --> 0:9:27,76
round ledge right here--


242
0:9:27,76 --> 0:9:31,1
doing back flips around
this, just like tail


243
0:9:31,1 --> 0:9:31,98
slides, all that shit.


244
0:9:31,98 --> 0:9:33,656
This definitely was sick.


245
0:9:33,656 --> 0:9:36,41
To me, this is like a legit
spot, where it was fun.


246
0:9:36,41 --> 0:9:39,1
And a lot of people
filmed shit here.


247
0:9:39,1 --> 0:9:41,2
Underneath here when it would
rain, a lot of people would go


248
0:9:41,2 --> 0:9:42,55
down to the subway.


249
0:9:42,55 --> 0:9:45,34
And there was kind of like a
ramp, like a walking ramp.


250
0:9:45,34 --> 0:9:46,49
But it was super wide.


251
0:9:46,49 --> 0:9:47,72
It was the whole hallway.


252
0:9:47,72 --> 0:9:49,91
And people used to just skate
and set up shit and


253
0:9:49,91 --> 0:9:51,71
do ollies and stuff.


254
0:9:51,71 --> 0:9:54,15
I don't know, it was fun
when it was raining.


255
0:9:54,15 --> 0:9:56,69
You remember the second coming
of Union Square, when they


256
0:9:56,69 --> 0:9:58,72
redid this park right here?


257
0:9:58,72 --> 0:10:2,92
So everybody came back to
Union Square to skate.


258
0:10:2,92 --> 0:10:4,925
But there was really nothing
else, nothing new to skate.


259
0:10:4,925 --> 0:10:8,35
They just extended
the sidewalk.


260
0:10:8,35 --> 0:10:9,66
This spot was--


261
0:10:9,66 --> 0:10:10,61
it was good for a while because
it was all that


262
0:10:10,61 --> 0:10:11,6
construction material.


263
0:10:11,6 --> 0:10:12,85
You know what I mean?


264
0:10:12,85 --> 0:10:15,23
And then when they finished,
it was good for a while.


265
0:10:15,23 --> 0:10:17,1
But let's go check it out.


266
0:10:17,1 --> 0:10:19,45
I mean, they used to come down
off the steps, and then


267
0:10:19,45 --> 0:10:24,45
probably to where this large
circular pattern was.


268
0:10:24,45 --> 0:10:26,19
That was actually the street.


269
0:10:26,19 --> 0:10:31,76
So I remember some crazy BMX
guy, Brendan Kennedy actually


270
0:10:31,76 --> 0:10:35,66
bunny-hopped off the steps into
the street, which is,


271
0:10:35,66 --> 0:10:38,65
seriously, 20 fuckin' feet
or something like that.


272
0:10:38,65 --> 0:10:40,5
It was kind of impossible.


273
0:10:40,5 --> 0:10:41,5
Damn, I can't believe
this guy did it.


274
0:10:41,5 --> 0:10:41,69
I saw him do it.


275
0:10:41,69 --> 0:10:43,5
I was like, damn, that's sick.


276
0:10:43,5 --> 0:10:45,62
You ever get my message about
that kid I heard.


277
0:10:45,62 --> 0:10:47,34
I was in the middle
of nowhere.


278
0:10:47,34 --> 0:10:49,986
And he said, something about,
you go latered?


279
0:10:49,986 --> 0:10:50,87
You ever get my message?


280
0:10:50,87 --> 0:10:51,53
PATRICK O'DELL: Yeah, yeah.


281
0:10:51,53 --> 0:10:52,78
STEVE RODRIGUEZ: Dude,
I was fuckin' dyin'.


282
0:10:52,78 --> 0:10:58,68



283
0:10:58,68 --> 0:11:1,8
A lot of people skateboard
here, sir?


284
0:11:1,8 --> 0:11:3,74
No, I'm saying, do a lot of
people try to though?


285
0:11:3,74 --> 0:11:4,94
SECURITY GUARD: They try to.


286
0:11:4,94 --> 0:11:7,35
But they don't allow
that here.


287
0:11:7,35 --> 0:11:9,59
Because that's the guy that
runs the building.


288
0:11:9,59 --> 0:11:10,97
STEVE RODRIGUEZ: The boss.


289
0:11:10,97 --> 0:11:12,37
The boss with his ladies.


290
0:11:12,37 --> 0:11:13,87
Hey, hey, check it out--


291
0:11:13,87 --> 0:11:15,5
Epic.


292
0:11:15,5 --> 0:11:16,325
We got an Epic pin.


293
0:11:16,325 --> 0:11:17,74
It's a pin that says
Epic, dude.


294
0:11:17,74 --> 0:11:18,99
That's awesome.


295
0:11:18,99 --> 0:11:28,3



296
0:11:28,3 --> 0:11:32,52
This is another little gap right
here, over the stairs


297
0:11:32,52 --> 0:11:35,3
and over the fence, quote
unquote, something you'd see


298
0:11:35,3 --> 0:11:36,74
in a magazine in California.


299
0:11:36,74 --> 0:11:37,16
You know what I mean?


300
0:11:37,16 --> 0:11:39,77
But it actually was here, and
you could skate here.


301
0:11:39,77 --> 0:11:42,14
First 5boro video, Mike Peterson
has that shit.


302
0:11:42,14 --> 0:11:45,39
He does front side 180 and
the other [INAUDIBLE].


303
0:11:45,39 --> 0:11:46,64
Over that way?


304
0:11:46,64 --> 0:11:51,35



305
0:11:51,35 --> 0:11:54,95
That's a good opening, like the
cube, the biggest non-spot


306
0:11:54,95 --> 0:11:57,91
spot there is.


307
0:11:57,91 --> 0:11:59,31
Or there was.


308
0:11:59,31 --> 0:12:2,21
At the time, this
was like the TF.


309
0:12:2,21 --> 0:12:4,42
It's like the default
spot to go, doing


310
0:12:4,42 --> 0:12:5,7
manuals on six-inch curbs.


311
0:12:5,7 --> 0:12:15,94



312
0:12:15,94 --> 0:12:18,87
This curb had more, has
been [INAUDIBLE]


313
0:12:18,87 --> 0:12:20,46
more than anything.


314
0:12:20,46 --> 0:12:23,44
It sucked, too, because
it had this lip on it


315
0:12:23,44 --> 0:12:24,17
that you locked in.


316
0:12:24,17 --> 0:12:26,34
But you probably had to slide
the whole thing in


317
0:12:26,34 --> 0:12:27,87
order to get out.


318
0:12:27,87 --> 0:12:30,58
If you really think about it,
it's just really more like--


319
0:12:30,58 --> 0:12:31,56
it's not really the tricks.


320
0:12:31,56 --> 0:12:34,1
It's just like, oh, shit,
that's in New York City.


321
0:12:34,1 --> 0:12:37,59
I mean right away that gives
it so much more validity


322
0:12:37,59 --> 0:12:41,33
Harold had some lines here just
doing manuals, It's just


323
0:12:41,33 --> 0:12:44,91
I'll admit I backflipped it a
couple times with the cool


324
0:12:44,91 --> 0:12:46,16
guys in the background.


325
0:12:46,16 --> 0:12:51,2



326
0:12:51,2 --> 0:12:54,38
Nah, there's plenty of places
to skate besides this place.


327
0:12:54,38 --> 0:12:56,29
A lot of people can
watch you here.


328
0:12:56,29 --> 0:12:58,94
It's just kind of like
a hang-out spot.


329
0:12:58,94 --> 0:13:2,33
A perfect example is what is the
real reason people stopped


330
0:13:2,33 --> 0:13:4,9
skating at the Brooklyn banks?


331
0:13:4,9 --> 0:13:5,565
It's because they put that
fence on the wall.


332
0:13:5,565 --> 0:13:7,4
And you could no longer
sit there.


333
0:13:7,4 --> 0:13:10,47
So at the time, all the people
that used to go down there and


334
0:13:10,47 --> 0:13:12,56
sit on the wall, there
was no longer a spot.


335
0:13:12,56 --> 0:13:13,48
Because they couldn't
sit there.


336
0:13:13,48 --> 0:13:14,99
Here there's plenty
of room to sit.


337
0:13:14,99 --> 0:13:19,29
So it's just people wanting to
get associated with that, the


338
0:13:19,29 --> 0:13:22,56
New York experience, and skating
in New York City.


339
0:13:22,56 --> 0:13:27,16
And I don't know.


340
0:13:27,16 --> 0:13:30,31
When you think about
it, so much of


341
0:13:30,31 --> 0:13:31,98
that footage is awesome.


342
0:13:31,98 --> 0:13:35,89
It's classic to see people
skating at an old spot back in


343
0:13:35,89 --> 0:13:37,36
the day, this and that.


344
0:13:37,36 --> 0:13:41,47
But was the skating
really up to par?


345
0:13:41,47 --> 0:13:42,7
I don't know.


346
0:13:42,7 --> 0:13:42,91
Was it?


347
0:13:42,91 --> 0:13:44,87
Was it not just the same shit?


348
0:13:44,87 --> 0:13:46,12
I don't know.


349
0:13:46,12 --> 0:13:48,53
If it was really a good spot,
why aren't people


350
0:13:48,53 --> 0:13:49,78
skating here right now?


351
0:13:49,78 --> 0:13:51,95



352
0:13:51,95 --> 0:13:54,68
Am I being pretty negative
here, O'Dell?


353
0:13:54,68 --> 0:13:55,13
I'm not.


354
0:13:55,13 --> 0:13:56,45
It's just more like
reality, dude.


355
0:13:56,45 --> 0:15:56,45
