###12 AARON ROSE: [SYNTHESIZED VOICE]
###13 Hi, I'm Aaron Rose.
###14 
###17 Barry McGee is a San Francisco-based artist.
###22 His drawings, paintings, and mixed media installations take
###26 their inspiration from contemporary urban culture,
###29 incorporating elements such as empty liquor bottles and spray
###34 paint cans, found wood and scrap metal.
###37 
###45 His work has been featured in solo exhibitions at the Walker
###49 Arts Center in Minneapolis, the Prada Foundation in Milan,
###53 Brandeis University's Rose Art Museum, and the Watari Museum
###58 of Contemporary Art in Tokyo.
###61 We sat down with him recently for this rare interview.
###64 
###77 In recent years, your work has become much more conceptual.
###82 [ELECTRONIC MUSIC PLAYING]
###90 AARON ROSE: [SYNTHESIZED VOICE]
###91 The geometric panels, for example.
###96 Where does the inspiration for the
###98 geometric/conceptual work come from?
###101 BARRY MCGEE: [SPANISH-ACCENTED SYNTHESIZED VOICE]
###102 I became bored of the faces and imagery.
###105 I had been waiting for my encounter with
###107 abstraction for some time.
###111 It was very slow coming.
###115 It was and is a slow-motion car crash for me.
###118 I'm still spinning out, waiting for
###121 impact, to some degree.
###122 
###132 AARON ROSE: [SYNTHESIZED VOICE]
###132 What is it about San Francisco that interests you?
###137 BARRY MCGEE: [SYNTHESIZED VOICE]
###137 Well, there really is no city like San Francisco.
###140 There are so many different economies running right up
###144 against each other.
###145 It has changed quite a bit in the last 10 years.
###149 But somehow, it still retains a solid population of freaks
###152 and anarchists.
###153 What can be better than an aging transvestite anarchist?
###157 
###160 AARON ROSE: [SYNTHESIZED VOICE]
###160 Do you think the city has had an influence on you?
###164 BARRY MCGEE: [SYNTHESIZED VOICE]
###164 Yes, it has.
###166 But I'm starting to let other environments slip in also.
###169 
###182 AARON ROSE: [SYNTHESIZED VOICE]
###182 McGee is also a graffiti artist working on the streets
###193 since the 1980s, where he is known by the tag name Twist.
###198 
###202 His trademark icon, a caricatured male figure with
###206 sagging eyes and a bemused expression, recalls the
###210 homeless people and transients who call the
###213 streets their home.
###215 It communicates the artist's strong empathy with people who
###218 have been left behind by contemporary society.
###222 
###230 Rather than being another graffiti artist who does
###234 things in galleries, I've always considered your work to
###238 be much more about the history of graffiti.
###241 Would you agree?
###243 BARRY MCGEE: [SYNTHESIZED VOICE]
###243 Well, there is a great history of graffiti
###246 and graffiti writers.
###247 I only take part in a small blip in the scale of things.
###252 Galleries are boring.
###253 You know that, Aaron.
###254 That's why there is so much graffiti on the streets.
###259 This trend of graffiti in galleries will pass, and
###263 something truly more horrific will replace it.
###266 All artists: Please get back in the
###268 safety of the galleries.
###269 
###274 AARON ROSE: [SYNTHESIZED VOICE]
###274 What is the difference for you in working at a gallery, in a
###278 museum, or on the street?
###280 BARRY MCGEE: [SYNTHESIZED VOICE]
###280 One is boring.
###281 One isn't.
###282 
###287 AARON ROSE: [SYNTHESIZED VOICE]
###287 What do you think about the art world?
###289 BARRY MCGEE: [SYNTHESIZED VOICE]
###290 It is really great.
###291 The energy is really good, with lots of fresh young
###294 upstarts moving in every month.
###296 How else would we have met, Aaron?
###298 
###307 AARON ROSE: [SYNTHESIZED VOICE]
###307 Destruction seems to be a common thread in your work.
###311 What is it about chaos that inspires you and your artwork?
###315 BARRY MCGEE: [SYNTHESIZED VOICE]
###315 It takes a lot of work to destroy something.
###317 I've worked the last 25 years building, day in, day out.
###322 They painted over everything I built.
###324 Even my oldest rooftop graffiti masterpiece from the
###329 late '80s is gone.
###331 Destruction is all around us.
###333 They can't destroy me.
###335 I've only just begun.
###337
