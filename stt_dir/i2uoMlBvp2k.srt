RYAN DUFFY: So it's the 13th
year of the Chavez regime here


8
0:0:32,42 --> 0:0:35,33
in Venezuela, and his Bolivarian
revolution has left


9
0:0:35,33 --> 0:0:37,805
the country deeply divided
along political lines.


10
0:0:37,805 --> 0:0:41,11
And despite its egalitarian
aims, the economic divide


11
0:0:41,11 --> 0:0:44,64
between the haves and the
have-nots remains staggering.


12
0:0:44,64 --> 0:0:47,84
Despite all this, in this
election year, the issue that


13
0:0:47,84 --> 0:0:50,88
will decide the future of this
country is violence.


14
0:0:50,88 --> 0:0:53,38
Venezuela has become known as
one of the most dangerous


15
0:0:53,38 --> 0:0:56,97
countries in the world, and last
year alone, Caracas had


16
0:0:56,97 --> 0:0:58,71
more violent deaths
than Baghdad.

With a population a tenth the

Venezuela last year managed
to record more


20
0:1:8,42 --> 0:1:9,63

21
0:1:9,63 --> 0:1:13,9
An astonishing 19,000
violent deaths in a


22
0:1:13,9 --> 0:1:15,44
population of 29 million.


23
0:1:15,44 --> 0:1:17,89
LUIS CEDENO: If you want to
compare with wars going on in


24
0:1:17,89 --> 0:1:20,36

don't have that


25
0:1:20,36 --> 0:1:22,39

are we in a state of war?

of Caracas' finest,


29
0:1:32,49 --> 0:1:33,87
we headed to Pitara--


30
0:1:33,87 --> 0:1:36,29
a sprawling slum where a
shocking percentage of the


31

32
0:1:37,81 --> 0:1:40,29
to get a lay of the criminal
landscape.


33
0:1:40,29 --> 0:1:42,195
There's probably two ways to go
to this neighborhood, with


34
0:1:42,195 --> 0:1:44,59
the guys who run it from the
inside, and the guys who


35
0:1:44,59 --> 0:1:46,77
control it from the outside,
otherwise, the guys with guns.

to do when and if we come

43
0:2:12,74 --> 0:2:14,2
hide under the tires.


44
0:2:14,2 --> 0:2:17,45
And all that kind of made
it a little more real.


45

We spoke with Luis Cedeno, the
head of Paz Activa, an NGO


46

in Venezuela.

you would see in Pitara?


48
0:2:25,67 --> 0:2:27,97
You would see gang violence.

out, you're in the middle of

going to get hurt.

to grenades.

You can actually rent the gun
