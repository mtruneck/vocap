###7 (Jacque Fresco) The discussion today is about depression.
###11 There are many people that have been depressed for many years
###15 and I get lots of letters.
###17 Sometimes they say that
###20 "I found no meaning in life, no purpose, and
###25 you pulled me out of it."
###27 I get a lot of letters like that
###30 so the only thing I can say [is that] it's not due to genetics.
###35 If it was due to genetics, I couldn't pull them out.
###38 Does that make sense to you?
###40 What is depression?
###44 If you live vicariously through another person
###48 (let's say you rely on that person entirely)
###52 you live, and that person dies
###55 you lose your identity
###57 because you put your identity in another person
###60 which isn't a good thing to do.
###62 That's a kind of dependency. You know what I mean?
###67 That's a part of depression, a little bit of it.
###71 The rest is loss of identity.
###74 You can lose your identity
###76 if you're brought up with a philosophy of life
###79 that doesn't reinforce you.
###82 If you're brought up with a set of values: "Do the right thing
###85 and everything will work out all right"
###88 and if it doesn't work out all right, you become depressed
###91 because you lose predictability. Is that clear?
###95 If you have predictability about yourself and other people
###100 you can anticipate certain things.
###104 If you have no answer, if you look for answers in your own mind
###110 it isn't exposed enough.
###113 There's not enough in schools that give you a way of thinking
###118 so you can solve problems.
###120 It isn't that they don't want to. They don't have it.
###124 They've never found a way of thinking they can solve problems.
###128 That's why, when the businessman retires
###132 he may become depressed
###135 because he has no game to play.
###138 All his life, say a guy that owns a jewelry store, that sells jewelry
###144 and every sale makes him feel good.
###146 Then he retires
###149 and he has nothing anymore.
###151 He has no identity, except 'sales of jewelry.'
###155 Do you understand? That's gone?
###158 What follows is depression.
###160 There are some dogs that have been depressed
###164 due to that they had a very close relationship with their master.
###168 When the master dies
###170 they sat next to the master and wouldn't go away
###174 and bark at anybody that would try to take them away.
###178 Their full identification was as a team with their master.
###183 They had no identification when the master died.
###186 They had no way of looking at it.
###190 The difference between humans and most animals [is that]
###193 most animals don't fear death. They don't even know there is such a thing.
###197 They move away from animals that are larger than they are.
###202 That's a reflex, but they don't know what death is
###205 nor do they think of it.
###208 So far, any questions?
###212 Okay.
###214 A person then asks themselves questions:
###217 "Why did my wife leave me?"
###219 and they can't figure it out, because everything they've done
###223 was pleasing
###227 and they don't understand that.
###229 That is not necessarily a logical question.
###233 Your wife may have left you for many different reasons:
###237 that she likes a guy tall, with blond wavy hair
###241 or stocky, or whatever.
###244 If you don't meet that image, she might leave you.
###247 The assumption that she won't leave you is what can depress you.
###252 Your assumption about the world:
###254 "Surely they won't have another war, while they're having a war now!"
###259 you can't say that. You can say
###262 "I'd like to see peace on Earth," so you work toward it
###267 but if you hope there's peace on Earth
###269 you might get depressed by the next war.
###273 See, when people ask me, "When will the Venus Project be built?"
###277 The honest answer is "I don't know."
###280 I don't even know if we'll get there
###282 but I can't accept what I see, so I try to intervene.
###288 Intervening, does that mean we'll have a better world? Not necessarily.
###293 Whatever you get is what you get.
###295 Do you understand that?
###297 The assumptions:
###299 "Surely people can all see the logic of a one global society."
###303 No, they can't!
###306 That's a major problem
###308 so you use different techniques
###310 to try to get them oriented towards that.
###314 Okay, so what is depression and how do you get rid of it?
###319 If you're depressed it means
###321 you're looking within yourself for answers
###325 and you can't get that.
###327 How did I get it?
###330 I didn't find it in psychology books at all.
###334 Here's how I got it.
###337 I sat down, I said: "What is depression? " I said "I don't know."
###342 How can I know what it is?
###344 A depressed person always seems to have a low self-image.
###350 Do you know what that means?
###352 "I'm not getting anywhere in life. I'm not respected
###356 three girls have left me. " Whatever it is
###359 it's a low self-sufficiency to start with.
###363 Instead of looking for 'the girl of your dreams'
###367 you try to make her. Do you know what that means?
###370 Educate her, in whatever way you can.
###373 Does it mean it will work perfectly? No.
###376 But it will work better than you doing nothing.
###379 Do you understand that?
###381 Therefore depression is not only loss of self-image
###386 they have none.
###388 A guy finds himself in the Marines
###391 and he wants to be successful in the Marines
###394 and that can't bring success
###397 unless they give you medals and everybody pats you on the back.
###401 That's your self-image: "I made it," you can say.
###405 Or an actor, that does...
###409 a theater actor that acts before a live audience
###413 and they applaud after.
###415 That makes him feel good.
###417 [When it's] a movie, he doesn't know.
###419 If he works in a movie, he doesn't know that people are going to applaud.
###424 Do you understand that?
###426 Therefore, he could encounter depression.
###429 Anybody that does any routine:
###432 a job, a jeweler, a plumber, an artist, a painter
###437 if they don't get rewarded for their painting
###440 like "You're a genius, you're good, creative"
###444 that makes them go on painting.
###446 If people say "What the hell is that supposed to be?"
###449 If they paint because they like to paint that's much better
###453 if that occurs.
###455 If you go for a walk because you like to go for a walk
###458 not because the doctor told you to go for a walk
###460 everyday, for at least a half hour
###463 but if you don't do it because you want to do it
###466 Ii you go out for a walk through the country
###469 and you smell the trees and you look around
###472 and you're pleased by that, do it.
###474 If it depresses you going for a walk
###477 you have to restore the self-image.
###480 In most instances there is no self-image
###484 so you have to give them a self-image.
###487 You have to talk about a lot of things [like] "I didn't know that
###491 that water became ice suddenly.
###494 I thought it was gradually how it became..."
###496 Whatever it is, if you expose them to different branches of science
###501 and they begin to find answers that satisfy them
###505 their self-image grows.
###508 If you make a Lutheran out of a person that says
###510 "Have faith in God. He'll look after you"
###513 if you put that faith in somebody you can't see or touch
###516 it may carry you through
###519 because you know there's somebody up there that loves you
###521 even though nobody does
###523 (that there is somebody up there)
###526 and that helps some people
###528 but it's not genuine help. Do you understand?
###532 Because [he] says to the minister "What did I do wrong?"
###536 If you believe in right and wrong, you can get depressed:
###540 "I must have done the wrong thing."
###542 It isn't the 'wrong' thing that you do.
###545 It's a less valid thing that you do.
###548 It's a less appropriate thing that you do. Do you know what I mean?
###552 Not wrong. If you work on somebody:
###555 "Snap out of that depression! Have faith in yourself
###559 and confidence!"
###561 Well, they might get fooled "Gee, you sound great!"
###564 but that doesn't take away that self-image.
###568 You don't take away the self-image. You add to it.
###573 You understand what that means? Whatever the person is.
###577 They only have no self-image. They don't know who they are.
###584 (If you're in pain, that's different. I'm not talking about that.
###587 If you have a tumor growing in your lungs and you can hardly breathe
###591 that's something else. That's not depression.
###595 That's physical disability.)
###598 If you have your health
###600 and you feel that you're learning something everyday
###606 and don't ever assume that you can fix something too.
###609 You can try to fix it: "I am going to try to fix it"
###612 and if that doesn't work you come at it another way.
###615 If that doesn't work, say "I can't handle it:
###617 I need more information in that area."
###622 That's what self-confidence is.
###624 The more genuine information a person has in certain areas...
###629 People that do feel "I can't get up before hundred people
###633 and say something because
###635 I worry about whether I'll 'goof'
###639 and they'll laugh at me."
###641 Here's how you handle that:
###643 You never talk to people to win approval.
###647 You talk to people to inform.
###649 If you were in a building, in the hallway
###652 and a big beam fell on fire, you'd go in for the thousand people
###657 and say "Exit as fast as you can. There's a fire!"
###660 and you won't feel bad about it because what you're saying
###663 is essential to their well-being
###666 but when you gamble and you say "I don't believe in God!"
###669 at a church meeting, they'd all say "What?!"
###672 They're not going to say "How do you account for all this?"
###676 They don't even do that.
###678 If they don't do that, there's no bridge. You have to build a bridge.
###684 Even a religious person, when they get a [broken] window crank
###688 and they crank it and the window doesn't open
###690 they take it back to the company.
###693 They need verification.
###695 When they buy something the [sales] guy says
###697 "If you buy this window it's hurricane-proof
###700 because there's a sheet of plastic between two sheets of glass
###705 so you can't smash it with an object."
###708 You have to give the person with a low self-sufficiency
###712 a high self-sufficiency by giving him a direction, or her
###719 so they don't concentrate on themselves:
###722 "I've been working all these years and I've nothing to show for it!"
###725 "Did you assume that you would have something?"
###728 What you have to do is engage in self-image and ask questions:
###733 Why I am depressed? Why do I feel insufficient in a crowd?
###738 Because I'm hoping the crowd will like what I say.
###742 [As for me] I don't give a shit.
###744 If they believe the Earth is flat and I find out it's round
###748 I enjoy telling them it's round.
###751 If they refuse it, that's their problem, not mine.
###755 If you feel you are unsuccessful in presenting an idea
###760 the assumption that you will be successful is depressing.
###766 Do you understand that? That's what makes depression.
###769 When you do something and nothing happens;
###771 when you row a boat and it doesn't move.
###773 If you get in a boat, and you don't know how to use the oars
###776 and it doesn't move, you get depressed.
###780 When you pull on the string and the motor doesn't start
###783 you say "What the hell? " and you pull on it, until it does start
###787 or you learn that you might have to change the spark plug.
###791 It might have a shorter gap or a longer gap
###794 and you bring the gap closer together so you have a spark.
###798 If you don't know those basic things, you can kick the lawnmower.
###803 We tend to project living human characteristics into things.
###808 Sometimes, if your binoculars don't work, you throw them on the couch
###813 (do you know what I mean?)
###815 because you get mad at the binoculars.
###817 You give it a personality "God damn it, you should work!"
###821 "I paid $40 for it. That's why it should work."
###826 No, you paid $40 and it doesn't work, so you take it back
###831 or you leave it until you go into town again
###834 but throwing it on the couch or the floor, doesn't make it work.
###839 Sometimes, if there's a loose wire in your TV set
###843 and you kick the set and the wires [connect], it'll go on again
###847 so sometimes that carries on that type of value system.
###852 I think I covered everything related to depression.
###856 It's a low self-image, or no self-image, or looking for justice.
###863 If you give them something to do that they identify with
###868 (not something that you like) something...
###871 Talk to them about The Venus Project, work on it, talk to other people
###874 then they feel they are doing something.
###877 If other people don't understand them, they might feel disappointed.
###881 What they're disappointed in
###883 is their inability to make contact with other people.
###887 It takes practice and error and mistakes.
###891 When I first walked over to [Ku Klux] Klan people [and said]
###894 "Why are you beating up the black guy? He didn't do anything to you"
###898 they just said "There's a nigger-lover from the North!"
###902 They did not hear that nor could they hear that. Do you understand?
###907 If you talk to a depressed person, and you show them what it is
###912 so that they know what's wrong with them:
###915 They don't have a self-image.
###917 How do you get a self-image? By learning new things.
###922 By learning things that take you out of the old value system.
