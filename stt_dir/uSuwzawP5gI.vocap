###8 REIHAN SALAM: Hi.
###9 I'm Reihan.
###10 And I'm here in Los Angeles with Vice.
###12 And I'm about to meet Larry Flynt, pornographer, rebel
###18 godless heathen, political activist, and so much more.
###23 Let's go.
###25 
###32 Mr. Flynt, thanks so much for inviting us into your office.
###35 It's incredibly generous of you.
###37 LARRY FLYNT: All right.
###38 Thank you.
###38 REIHAN SALAM: I wanted to ask you, was there a moment when
###41 you were a kid when you decided that you were destined
###45 for extraordinary things?
###46 LARRY FLYNT: I was about 10 years old, and I was standing
###49 on a swinging bridge across the river in Eastern Kentucky.
###54 You don't understand, our biggest
###56 industry was jury duty.
###59 You couldn't get a job anywhere.
###61 And I just felt there was more to the world
###68 than where I was living.
###70 I felt I wanted to be wealthy because I was so poor then.
###76 I felt that success was measured by money.
###80 Now I realize that success is not measured
###84 by what you've got.
###85 But it's measured by the obstacles you had to overcome
###89 in order to achieve it.
###91 REIHAN SALAM: Was there a particular person when you
###93 were 10 who inspired you, or someone who came from the
###97 outside world, someone who gave you a bigger sense of the
###100 world outside of Eastern Kentucky?
###102 LARRY FLYNT: My role models were really world leaders and
###106 politicians and people like that, rather than actors.
###111 I was influenced a great deal by President Kennedy.
###118 REIHAN SALAM: Kennedy is a guy who grew up in great privilege
###122 and someone who, I suppose you could say, used that privilege
###125 to go into public service and devote himself to a larger
###127 cause than himself.
###128 But I wonder why it was Kennedy who sparked that
###132 enthusiasm in you, given that he came from a very different
###135 kind of background.
###136 LARRY FLYNT: I don't have a good answer for that, other
###140 than when he would speak, I used to get goose pimples.
###143 JOHN F. KENNEDY: Before this decade is out of landing a man
###147 on the moon and returning him safely to the earth.
###150 LARRY FLYNT: I always thought he was so profound.
###154 REIHAN SALAM: I would love to know, the Obama presidency
###158 began with tremendous enthusiasm.
###160 And I wonder, as someone who is a great devotee of
###163 President Kennedy, do you think that President Obama has
###166 proved to be up to snuff?
###168 LARRY FLYNT: I think President Obama has overperformed.
###172 
###175 I know this has become a cliche, but it's so true.
###180 He got handed on his platter when he became president more
###187 than any president in history ever had to deal with.
###192 I'm just amazed he's--
###195 Sure, he hasn't done everything perfect.
###197 He made a few mistakes along the way.
###200 But he did a marvelous job.
###207 REIHAN SALAM: When you say he's overperformed, is there a
###211 particular quality that he has that you think
###213 accounts for that?
###214 LARRY FLYNT: I see him and Jack Kennedy have the same
###217 intellect, in terms of being smart.
###220 
###223 That's been his best asset.
###224 But now you don't understand that when he was trying to do
###229 business with the Republicans on the deficit and the debt
###233 ceiling and all that kind of stuff, he was just one man
###236 fighting everybody to try and get a deal.
###241 REIHAN SALAM: Did you ever think that
###243 you'd go into politics?
###244 Did you ever think you'd run for office?
###245 LARRY FLYNT: No.
###247 But I've always been fascinated with politics.
###250 And I actually think that I know more than most people do
###258 about the political status of our nation.
###262 REIHAN SALAM: You recently announced a
###265 challenge, a bounty.
###268 Can you tell us a little bit about that?
###270 LARRY FLYNT: Well, in every presidential cycle for the
###273 last 30 years, we've run a full page ad in the Washington
###277 Post where we offer a $1 million reward for anyone that
###283 can provide information on their politicians.
###288 REIHAN SALAM: Have you paid out the $1
###289 million in the past?
###290 LARRY FLYNT: Oh yes.
###291 We've had a number of different--
###292 Sometimes they've had to split it up because there've been
###295 more sources than one.
###297 There is nothing that will change someone's moral outlook
###300 more than cash in large sums.
###304 REIHAN SALAM: Indeed.
###306 LARRY FLYNT: And I don't think that because you pay for
###309 information that it's any less credible.
###313 REIHAN SALAM: You're not just a political activist.
###315 You're also are someone who built a mammoth, innovative
###319 publishing empire.
###320 And I wonder what was the innovation?
###323 What was your key insight?
###325 LARRY FLYNT: I was successful not because of what I did, but
###330 in spite of what I did.
###333 I did not know the publishing business.
###336 I just knew that I read magazines
###338 like Playboy and Penthouse.
###340 I had a chain of clubs in the Midwest.
###343 And somebody said, why don't you do a club
###345 like Playboy did?
###348 So I looked at the magazines, and I just realized, hey, if
###355 they want to know which car to buy,
###357 they'll buy another magazine.
###359 If they want to know how to make some perfect martini,
###361 they can find out from a local bartender.
###365 They really wanted to know about girls, and they want to
###369 see pretty women.
###371 And that's more or less a philosophy that
###374 I applied to Hustler.
###376 It's that if you look at Playboy, it's obvious that
###380 Hefner likes blonds with big boobs, Amazon-type girls.
###384 You look at Hustler, you don't know what I like.
###388 Small, medium, large.
###390 We have brunettes, redheads, blondes, whatever.
###393 It's the girl next door look.
###395 You might see a girl in Hustler who reminds you of a
###398 girl you've seen at the laundromat or something.
###400 REIHAN SALAM: What was the initial inspiration to go into
###404 opening these clubs and sort of basically going into this
###407 business of--
###409 LARRY FLYNT: Well, when I got out of the Navy, I
###413 didn't have a trade.
###414 I didn't have a lot of formal education.
###416 So the easiest business for me to get into would be to go in
###420 the bar and club business.
###421 And that's what I did.
###423 And that's how I get started.
###426 REIHAN SALAM: Where did the original money come from?
###428 Was it just your savings from the Navy?
###430 LARRY FLYNT: I worked in factories, GM factories.
###433 And I saved a little money.
###436 The first license--
###439 All I had was only a beer bar.
###441 You couldn't even serve liquor.
###442 REIHAN SALAM: And this was in Dayton?
###444 LARRY FLYNT: Yeah.
###445 And then I continued to expand into other cities in Ohio.
###451 REIHAN SALAM: So in recent years, obviously the rise of
###454 the internet and internet pornography has been a huge
###457 challenge to a lot of those
###458 established publishing empires.
###460 And I wonder, have you ever felt under siege by it?
###463 Have you ever felt like this world you had built was really
###467 being shaken up?
###469 LARRY FLYNT: I first took notice in the '70s, when VHS
###474 and Betamax came along.
###479 I felt that that definitely was going to take adult movies
###485 into the home.
###487 And then in the '80s, as the internet started becoming the
###493 focus, I felt the industry's changing, and I
###498 better change with it.
###500 So I put up my first website in the early '90s.
###503 REIHAN SALAM: Do you ever miss that world of '70s, back
###506 before VHS and Betamax, and adult movies
###509 came into the home?
###510 Do you ever miss that world where people had to go to
###514 movie theaters and go to the red light district?
###514 LARRY FLYNT: Yeah, I miss it because it
###516 was a lot more simple.
###517 
###520 People think the world is simple today because you have
###524 all the gadgetry and the internet and everything.
###526 But life was much more simple then.
###529 And there's a certain yearning.
###531 REIHAN SALAM: Was there a camaraderie there in those
###534 clubs in Dayton and everywhere else that you were building
###537 up, where people were going to peep shows and going to adult
###540 movie theaters?
###542 Was there a spirit that you miss in those places?
###546 Or is that an [INAUDIBLE]?
###548 LARRY FLYNT: I definitely do.
###550 Those are my fondest memories, the early years with Hustler
###556 and building Hustler up.
###559 But then as I was saying, but I continued to diversify.
###564 I went into the gaming business.
###566 We have probably one of the most successful casinos in
###571 California, about half an hour south of LA, which is very
###575 profitable.
###576 REIHAN SALAM: There are a lot of people who fret a lot about
###580 how accessible pornography is and how the easy availability
###584 of pornography has really changed relations
###587 between men and women.
###589 Do you worry about that all?
###590 Do you think that it's changed things for the worse, or do
###592 you think it's changed things for the better?
###594 LARRY FLYNT: I think it changes it for the better.
###596 One thing that pornography does that people don't realize
###600 is it desensitizes people.
###602 Because one of the biggest problems in relationships now
###608 is premature ejaculation on behalf of the man.
###613 Well if I'm viewing pornography and being exposed
###617 to pornography, it takes that immediate impulse away.
###623 And you're not as apt to be so quick.
###628 REIHAN SALAM: Although I wonder, when you were growing
###631 up in eastern Kentucky, say when you were in your early
###633 teens, was there an excitement around forming those early
###640 attachments, those early relationships with girls that
###643 isn't necessarily there for today's teenagers?
###648 LARRY FLYNT: Possibly they may be a little bit more
###651 promiscuous today then it was then, as the religious right
###656 would try to get you to believe.
###658 They attribute this to my pornography.
###661 REIHAN SALAM: But it's also true that there are a lot of
###663 folks, a lot of feminists, who've given you a pretty hard
###666 time, and who've been very hostile.
###668 And I wonder, do you think that they just have it wrong?
###673 LARRY FLYNT: When they would criticize me about
###676 pornography, they'd say I was exploiting women, what I was
###679 doing was demeaning to women.
###682 That's like saying that Sports Illustrated exploits sports.
###687 That's what I was selling.
###689 I've never, ever had a woman pose for the magazine and say
###694 that she was coerced into doing it or that she felt she
###699 was being exploited.
###701 That's just the feminists coming up
###705 with their own brand.
###706 REIHAN SALAM: There was a moment in the late '70s when
###711 the evangelical movement was really on the rise.
###714 And there were a lot of people, who had never been a
###716 part of it, really got drawn into it.
###717 And my understanding is that in the late '70s, there was a
###720 moment when you yourself embraced religion.
###724 Do you remember that?
###725 And what was it that led you there?
###726 LARRY FLYNT: I got over that.
###729 REIHAN SALAM: What was it though back then?
###731 Because you were already a pretty successful entrepreneur
###733 at the time.
###733 LARRY FLYNT: I did have a very profound religious experience.
###739 And most people, when they have this born-again type
###746 experience, the average person has nobody to talk to.
###750 They don't want to go to the doctor because they don't want
###753 to be perceived as being mentally ill.
###756 So the only thing they can do is talk to a member of their
###759 family or neighbor or something.
###761 And they're directed to start going to church.
###763 So that way, you're already caught up in
###769 the religious sect.
###771 But I sought out a psychiatrist immediately after
###776 it happened to me.
###777 REIHAN SALAM: It's funny that it led you to the doctor,
###779 because most people when they feel that warmth, they would
###781 welcome it rather than go to the doctor.
###783 LARRY FLYNT: My psychiatrist simply told me--
###787 He said, we know nothing about the brain.
###789 He said, even brain surgeons don't know anything about it.
###794 He says, this is largely thought to be because of a
###799 iodine deficiency in your diet.
###802 REIHAN SALAM: Do you think that more devoutly religious
###806 Americans would be less devoutly religious if they
###809 just ate more salt?
###810 LARRY FLYNT: He showed me a whole map of the world.
###813 It shows where stronger iodine deposits were in the salts.
###818 And there was always a higher degree of manic depressive
###822 people that lived in those particular areas.
###825 So he says there's definitely a correlation between the
###828 iodine in the salt and the manic depressive and the use
###835 of lithium as treatment.
###837 REIHAN SALAM: How did that change things, that experience
###840 of having faced death?
###841 LARRY FLYNT: Somebody asked me once, they said, what's it
###843 like to be in a wheelchair all these years?
###846 I said, I don't know.
###848 I never thought about it until you asked me.
###850 I don't dwell on things I can't do anything about.
###853 So that in a nutshell tells you about the
###857 type of person I am.
###859 I don't waste time dealing with things
###862 that I can't solve.
###864
