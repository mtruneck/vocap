0:0:2,53 --> 0:0:6,84
– I bought something from you last week, and I'm very disappointed.


2
0:0:6,84 --> 0:0:8,56
– Oh yeah? What's the problem?


3
0:0:8,56 --> 0:0:19,46
– Yeah, well, my blackberry is not working.


4
0:0:19,46 --> 0:0:23,1
– What's the matter, it run out of juice?


5
0:0:23,1 --> 0:0:28,54
– No, no, it's completely frozen!


6
0:0:28,54 --> 0:0:30,32
– Oh, yeah, I can see that.


7
0:0:30,32 --> 0:0:37,24
I tell you what: let's try it on orange.


8
0:0:37,24 --> 0:0:39,56
– That's got a few black spots, you see...


9
0:0:39,56 --> 0:0:43,28
– Oh, dear, yes. Sorry about that.


10
0:0:43,28 --> 0:0:47,0
– Well, is there anything I can do to get my blackberry working?


11
0:0:47,0 --> 0:0:49,21
– Well, could be an application issue.


12
0:0:49,21 --> 0:0:51,38
Where'd you store that Blackberry?


13
0:0:51,38 --> 0:0:53,8
– Well, it was on my desktop.


14
0:0:53,8 --> 0:0:58,64
– Well, you could try using a mouse to drag the blackberry to the trash.


15
0:0:58,64 --> 0:1:0,7
Then after you've done that,


16
0:1:0,7 --> 0:1:5,84
you might wanna launch the blackberry from the desktop.


17
0:1:5,84 --> 0:1:8,54
– Well, I've already tried that a few times.


18
0:1:8,54 --> 0:1:12,4
I mean, all it did was mess up windows.


19
0:1:12,4 --> 0:1:14,4
– Well, it might be worth waiting a couple of weeks.


20
0:1:14,4 --> 0:1:16,4
They've got the latest blackberries coming in then.


21
0:1:16,4 --> 0:1:17,71
– Well, could you give me a date?


22
0:1:17,71 --> 0:1:21,59
– Certainly.


23
0:1:21,59 --> 0:1:25,84
– Let me put that date in my diary.


24
0:1:25,84 --> 0:1:27,3
– Anything else I can help you with?


25
0:1:27,3 --> 0:1:29,71
– Yes, yes. I've also got a problem, to be honest,


26
0:1:29,71 --> 0:1:34,11
with my apple.


27
0:1:34,11 --> 0:1:36,71
– Oh, dear, oh, dear. That is an old apple, isn't it?


28
0:1:36,71 --> 0:1:38,4
– Yeah. – When'd you buy that?


29
0:1:38,4 --> 0:1:39,55
– Last week.


30
0:1:39,55 --> 0:1:43,99
– Last week? They've brought out two new apples since then!


31
0:1:43,99 --> 0:1:44,95
What's the problem with it?


32
0:1:44,95 --> 0:1:49,6
– Well, I tried to put my dongle in it...


33
0:1:49,6 --> 0:1:50,31
and it won't fit.


34
0:1:50,31 --> 0:1:56,8
– Oh, yeah.


35
0:1:56,8 --> 0:1:58,8
And how big's your dongle?


36
0:1:58,8 --> 0:2:2,3
– Well, I don't know much about these things,


37
0:2:2,3 --> 0:2:6,85
but my wife's seen a few dongles in her time...


38
0:2:6,85 --> 0:2:10,82
and she says a little bit on the small side.


39
0:2:10,82 --> 0:2:13,75
– Well, I'm afraid there's not a lot I can do about that.


40
0:2:13,75 --> 0:2:19,79
Tell you what: let me try booting it.


41
0:2:19,79 --> 0:2:26,14
Now it's crashed.


42
0:2:26,14 --> 0:2:27,9
Anything else I can help you with?


43
0:2:27,9 --> 0:2:29,15
– Well, funnily enough, yes.


44
0:2:29,15 --> 0:2:31,74
My grandson's birthday's soon. – Oh, yeah.


45
0:2:31,74 --> 0:2:34,85
– Now, he's already got an apple and a blackberry.


46
0:2:34,85 --> 0:2:37,82
I mean, have you got anything else that he might just like?


47
0:2:37,82 --> 0:2:39,65
– Well, we're doing a special offer on these.


48
0:2:39,65 --> 0:2:41,59
I mean, I can't make head or tail of them,


49
0:2:41,59 --> 0:2:43,8
but the kids seem to like them.


50
0:2:43,8 --> 0:4:43,8
– Oh yeah? – "Eggs box," £3.60.
