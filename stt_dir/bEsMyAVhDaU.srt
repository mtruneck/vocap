with the tents


106
0:3:31,81 --> 0:3:33,91
and Anti-Hero lifestyle.


107
0:3:33,91 --> 0:3:36,27
Adding Spike Jonze into the
mix might make it a little


108
0:3:36,27 --> 0:3:38,22
more Girl skateboards.


109
0:3:38,22 --> 0:3:40,248

gnarliest tent ever.

you got your tent?


121
0:4:8,105 --> 0:4:11,29
SPIKE JONZE: I think Brink might
have me hooked up, but I


122
0:4:11,29 --> 0:4:13,88
think Eric's not coming
in until Monday, so


123
0:4:13,88 --> 0:4:14,856
I can use his stuff.


124
0:4:14,856 --> 0:4:17,89

decide to come on the trip?


125
0:4:17,89 --> 0:4:20,37

get out of town.


126
0:4:20,37 --> 0:4:21,18

127
0:4:21,18 --> 0:4:25,52
And just get out on the
road with the guys.


128
0:4:25,52 --> 0:4:29,96
And plus, I haven't been
on a trip with


129
0:4:29,96 --> 0:4:30,29
those guys in a while.


130
0:4:30,29 --> 0:4:34,508
In plus, if they're going out
with the Anti-Hero guys, which


131
0:4:34,508 --> 0:4:36,23
sounds like a one time thing.


132
0:4:36,23 --> 0:4:37,98
How often is that
going to happen?


133
0:4:37,98 --> 0:4:42,1
