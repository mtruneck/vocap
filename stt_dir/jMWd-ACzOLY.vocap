###5 Good afternoon It's February 7th, 2012
###10 This is for my daughter, Hannah, and more importantly for all her friends on
###15 Facebook who thought that her little rebellious post was cute... and for all you
###20 parents out there that think your kids don't post bad things on Facebook. Well I
###25 want to read you one I took off my daughter's Facebook wall that she
###29 thought she was being smart by blocking her parents from being able to see it.
###35 Hannah, you were grounded for about three months for doing something very
###39 similar to this, and I would've thought that with a father that works in IT for a living,
###44 you'd have better sense than to do it again.
###47 But I just spent about six hours yesterday fixing your computer for you, upgrading it
###51 for you, and spent about $130 on software.
###54 And today, I ran across a Facebook post that you didn't think I'd be able to see.
###60 Since you want to hide it from everyone, I'm going to share it with everybody.
###63 This is called "To My Parents" by the way. "To my parents, I'm not your damn slave.
###67 "To my parents, I'm not your damn slave.
###71 It's not my responsibility to clean up your shit. We have a cleaning lady for a
###75 reason. Her name is Linda, not Hannah.
###78 If you want coffee, get off your ass and make it yourself.
###82 If you want a garden, shovel the fertilizer yourself. Don't sit back on your ass and
###87 watch me do it. If you walk into the house and get mud
###90 all over the floor that I just cleaned, be my guest, but clean it up after you're
###95 done getting shit everywhere. I'm tired of picking up after you. You tell me
###99 at least once a day that I need to get a job." [laughs] And I love this part.
###105 "You could just pay me for all the shit that I do around the house!"
###108 Seriously, are you kidding me? I'll get to that in a minute.
###112   Every day, when I get home from school,  I have to do the dishes, clean the
###117  counter tops, all the floors, make all the beds,  do the laundry, and get the trash.
###121  I'm not even going to mention all the work  I do around your clinic.
###125 And if I don't do all that every day, I get grounded.
###130 Do you know how hard it is to keep up with chores and school work? It's
###133 freakin' crazy. I go to sleep at 10 every night because I'm too tired to stay up any
###137 longer and do anything else.  I have to get up at 5 in the morning to get ready for
###141 school. On the weekends, I have to sleep with my door locked so my little brother
###144 won't get me up at 6."  That part is true. "This is all true!  And I'm tired of this
###153 bullshit. Next time I have to pour a cup of coffee, I'm going to flip shit!  I have no
###157 idea how I have a life.  I'm going to hate the see the day when you get too old to
###162 wipe your ass and you call me asking for help. I won't be there.
###167 Signed, your pissed kid, Hannah." I'm going to address a couple of these.
###176 We have a lady that cleans the house for us, as a favor to trade off some services.
###181 She is not, and you will never again refer to her as a cleaning lady. That lady works
###188 harder in one day than you ever have in your life.  Pay you? For the chores...
###197 seriously?! Pay you for the chores that you're supposed to do around the house?
###200 You come home from school, and you have a list of chores that are on the wall
###204 because you can't remember them if you don't.  They are sweep the living room and
###211 kitchen floor. Which total will take you about 3 minutes. If the counter tops are
###216 dirty, wipe them down, which takes about a minute. If the dishwasher is full and
###222 been run, empty it and put the dishes away. If it's not, just be sure all the
###227 glasses and stuff are in the dishwasher. If you have any laundry of your own, do it.
###232 And if your bed is unmade, do it. You don't have to do my laundry. You don't
###239 have to make my bed. You don't have to make the guest bed. You have to make
###242 your own bed. Once a month or so, I guess you probably have to make the
###245 guest bed.  Pay you for chores? Are you out of your mind? You are 15, going on 16
###255 years old. You want things for your laptop. You want a new battery. You want
###259 a new cord. You want a new camera. You want a new phone. You want a new iPod.
###263 But you won't get off your lazy ass to even look for a job. The only job you've
###270 applied to is the one I made you apply to because I got the application for you.
###275 [Crumples up paper] You've been too lazy to even carry that
###280 back. When I was your age, I'd moved out of the house, lived on my own, went to
###286 college while in High School, worked two jobs, was a volunteer fireman, and still
###291 went to school. Your responsibilities include waking up on time, and getting on
###298 the bus. That's the end of your responsibilities each day. You don't have
###304 that hard of a life. But you're about to. I warned you months ago, about what
###308 would happen if you did something like this on Facebook again. The last
###315 time you were grounded, and quite frankly I've forgotten now, but it was for
###318 something fairly childish and stupid. We took away the computer, that kind of
###323 thing, no cell phone, no Facebook. And I told you, if it ever happened again, that it
###328 would be a lot worse. And I was really close that day to putting a bullet through
###335 your laptop. Now this time, I just spent all day yesterday, blew half my day,
###343 upgrading your laptop.  Putting new software on it. Spent about $130 in
###350 software to get everything the way you wanted to have it for school. You don't
###358 have to worry about buying a new laptop battery. You don't have to worry about
###363 buying a new power cord. You don't have to worry about buying a new camera.
###365 Because you probably won't be using any of them, until probably college. I don't
###368 know how to say how disappointed I am in you, and how disrespectful you were to
###378 every single adult in your life, but kid, you got it easy... way easy.  It's about to get
###386 harder. It's about to get a whole lot harder today. Because you're not going to see
###391 this and for all I know, you might not ever see it. But as soon as I'm done, I'm going
###394 to post this on your Facebook wall. So all those kids that thought that it was cool
###399 for how rebellious you were can see what happens. And all the parents may get an
###405 idea to boot up their own kids ass. There were more curse words in that one post,
###412 just ridiculous. Not happening. Disrespectful to me, your mother, your
###419 step-mother, your family, your friends, and yourself. So, I'm going to put a stop
###425 to it right now... [Picks up the camera]
###431 That right there is your laptop.  You see it's out here on the ground. This right
###437 here is my .45. [fires gun]
###442 That was the first round. [fires gun]
###445 These are exploding hollow point rounds, and you have to pay me back for these
###451 too, because these are about $1 apiece. [fires gun repeatedly]
###457 1..2..3..4..5..6.. Oh yeah, and after that comment you
###461 made about your mom, your mom told me to be sure I put one in there for her, so
###464 [fires gun] that one is for her. And if I got one left... [fires gun]... I got two left...
###469 [fires gun]... now I'm out. So, just for the record, whenever you're
###474 So, just for the record, whenever you're not grounded,
###480  whatever year that happens to be, you can have a new laptop
###485 when you buy a new laptop. And when you pay me back $130 for the software I
###489 spent on yours yesterday. Hope you've enjoyed your little fiasco on Facebook.
###495 Hope it was worth all this. Have a good day, y'all.
