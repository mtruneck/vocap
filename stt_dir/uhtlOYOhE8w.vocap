###1 Audience Members: Hey!
###2 Todd Park: How is everybody doing?
###3 Audience Members: Whooo!
###4 Todd Park: Fantastic!
###5 I'm Todd Park,
###6 U.S. Chief Technology Officer here with my brother,
###10 Steve Van Roekel, U.S. Chief Information Officer.
###12 [laughter]
###13 And it is our great pleasure to welcome
###15 you here today both those here in person and those
###19 watching on live stream.
###21 Today we've all come together to celebrate the
###22 Launch of the Presidential Innovation Fellows
###25 Program, a new initiative that is bringing 18
###29 incredibly talented private sector innovators
###31 from across America to D.C. to work with our best
###35 innovators for six months on five high-impact projects.
###39 These projects promise to support entrepreneurs,
###41 small businesses, job growth and the economy
###44 while also significantly improving the ability of
###46 the federal government to serve the American people.
###49 Today you will learn more about these five important
###50 projects and meet the 18 extraordinary Americans,
###55 our Inaugural Presidential Innovation Fellows who've
###57 agreed to drop everything, come to D.C. in the middle
###59 of summer, work incredibly hard to do great things
###62 for the American people.
###63 And you can follow the conversation on twitter,
###65 contribute to the conversation at #innovategov.
###69 Steven Van Roekel: So three months ago today
###71 Todd and I launched the U.S.
###72 Digital Government Strategy which is a
###75 groundbreaking plan to unleash the power of
###78 innovation and technology within government.
###82 The goals of the digital strategy were sort of three-fold.
###85 One was one to just have great impact, to focus on
###89 impact, and driving impact across government.
###91 Two was saving taxpayer money.
###93 We think we can do things better, faster and cheaper
###96 by unleashing innovation.
###97 And three was delivering government in a very
###100 citizen-centric way.
###102 Now given all of this we've made incredible
###105 progress the last three months.
###107 Today we are proud to announce a few things.
###109 One is the release of "Bring Your Own Device
###112 Toolkit for government" so teaching agencies how to
###115 use the resources to bear to allow employees to
###118 bring devices to work and utilize new technology
###121 within the boundaries of government.
###123 The second, and the census team is here from the
###125 Commerce Department, and today we are very proud to
###128 announce the launch of their new multi-platform
###131 mobile app that actually triangulates census data
###134 with economic data in really interesting ways.
###136 So I encourage all of you to go and check that out.
###139 But one thing Todd and I really realized going
###142 through this process was, you know, just releasing
###145 toolkits, just unleashing technology wasn't enough.
###148 We needed to bring to bear the power of people within
###150 government and that is what today is really all about.
###154 So based on programs like our Entrepreneurs and
###156 Residents Program we ran at the FDA and other
###159 places, and I believe the team is here from there as
###162 well, and programs like Code for America,
###165 a civic program --
###166 Todd Park: Whahoo!
###166 Steve Van Roekel: -- based on the West Coast,
###167 you know, we, Todd and I, on May 23rd, announced the
###171 Presidential Innovation Fellows Program which as
###173 Todd mentioned was a program that called on
###175 entrepreneurs from around America to come to
###177 Washington, to pick up their lives, to move, in
###180 many cases, across the continent to come work in
###183 government for a fixed period of time on these
###187 focused innovation projects.
###189 Within three weeks of announcing the innovation
###191 program, we had over 700 people apply for
###196 18 positions within government and thousands
###199 more had signed up to be followers and follow along
###203 and work with us as we moved forward.
###206 You'll meet the 18 today.
###208 We're very excited about it.
###209 And then hear more about the projects that all of
###212 the innovators are going to innovate on.
###215 Todd Park: And we were just so, so incredibly
###217 delighted at the outpouring from folks who
###221 wanted to come and serve, who wanted to help the
###223 projects, it was just an explosion of
###226 civic-mindedness, of a desire to serve country,
###229 you know, a dedication to the nation's future.
###231 And it was an incredibly difficult task as you take
###233 the 700 applicants, who were amazing, and somehow
###236 boil them down to just 18 folks that would actually
###240 come to D.C. to be fellows.
###242 Many reviewers actually told us in all their
###243 careers in government they had never seen an
###245 applicant pool quite like the 700 before.
###249 In the end the agency did actually select 18
###251 extraordinary Americans to serve as inaugural
###252 fellows, fellows who embody the spirit of
###255 American innovation, American entrepreneurship,
###258 and could can be the best ideas from the private
###260 sector from across the nation to bear on the
###263 critical task of building an ever more effective and
###265 efficient government.
###267 To say a few words about the critical importance of
###269 this work, it's my great pleasure to welcome to the
###271 stage Jeff Zients, the Acting Director of the
###273 Office of Management and Budget and Champion of
###276 Innovation on Awesomeness in general!
###278 Please welcome Jeff!
###279 [applause]
###284 Jeff Zients: That's a -- can you hear me?
###287 Good morning, everybody.
###288 That's a tough act to follow, Todd and Steve.
###290 And I see Steve Case here in the front row.
###294 Steve's daughter Katie and my daughter
###296 go to school together.
###298 And my daughter -- they're both 17 so you can imagine
###301 what we're dealing with.
###302 [laughter]
###303 -- but she frequently, she frequently
###305 reminds me "you're no Steve Case," as I struggle
###309 with my technology.
###311 But speaking of technology, having spent
###314 all of my time before three years ago in the
###317 private sector, so 20 odd years, I know firsthand
###320 how important technology has been to driving the
###322 success of the private sector and our overall
###325 global competitiveness.
###327 The President has been onto this since the
###329 beginning when he appointed for the first
###331 time ever a Chief Technology Officer and a
###334 Chief Information Officer.
###336 So right from the beginning the President
###339 has recognized the importance of technology
###340 for our economy, our global competitiveness,
###342 and for our government operations.
###345 If you think about productivity and the
###349 productivity increases, the year over year
###351 increases in the private sector, 1 1/2 to 2%
###354 increase for the last couple of decades in
###356 productivity, that compounds in a pretty big
###359 way and companies that weren't on that curve are
###364 no longer with us.
###366 It's hard to measure productivity in
###367 the federal government.
###369 But the best metric is some work done by McKinsey
###374 which says that the federal sector has grown
###376 in productivity but slower than the private sector.
###379 So there is a gap, a productivity gap between
###381 how the federal sector has increased its productivity
###383 across the last couple of decades and what the
###385 private sector has done.
###387 We all know that it is wrong to assume technology
###390 is the answer and lead with technology but
###392 technology at the same time has been at the
###393 center of those productivity gains.
###397 And we need to close that productivity gap.
###400 So central to closing that productivity gap is
###403 improving innovation and technology in
###405 the federal government.
###407 And I think we have made some good progress since
###409 the very beginning of the Administration.
###411 We have great people in the federal government.
###413 The idea of pairing the great people in the
###414 federal government with the best of the private
###416 sector to accelerate those efforts has me and all of
###420 us incredibly excited by the potential.
###424 I think that this is, all of us here, are present at
###428 the creation of something great.
###430 We're starting with -- is it 18 or 19?
###432 Steven Van Roekel: Eighteen.
###432 Jeff Zients -- eighteen, I think we will
###434 compound in a big way and look back and say remember
###437 when we were only 18?
###439 Because this idea of bringing the best of the
###441 private sector to the federal government and
###444 pairing our great resources here in the
###446 federal government with the private sector is
###447 something that we need to be doing more and more of.
###449 So thank you all for being pioneers.
###451 I am incredibly excited by the early work.
###455 And look forward to a great future of technology
###457 and innovation in the federal government.
###459 Thank you.
###459 [applause]
###471 John Berry: Well, congratulations to our fellows.
###474 I'm John Berry, the Director of the Office of
###476 Personnel Management, the people side of the equation.
###482 And as everybody knows, innovation starts with
###485 an idea somewhere.
###487 A lightbulb that happened over somebody's head,
###491 came out of a discussion, was provoked by an observation
###495 or inspired by a thought.
###499 And innovation is only worthwhile, I would argue,
###504 if it benefits somebody because it makes
###508 people's lives better.
###510 Because it makes their lives easier.
###513 Or maybe it makes their lives longer.
###516 And we can't forget that from end to end, there is
###520 always a human element in innovation.
###525 Now, we've tried to focus on human-centered design
###528 in our approaches at OPM.
###532 We've launched our innovation lab around that concept.
###535 And we are participating fully in collaborative
###538 initiatives like this one.
###541 And so that's why I wanted to focus on the human
###543 collaboration side of innovation and the
###547 reasoning behind the Presidential Innovative
###549 Fellows, Bill Joy, a Co-founder of
###553 Sun Microsystems, pointed out what is now known as Joy's Law.
###559 No matter who you are, most of the smartest
###562 people work for somebody else.
###566 Now, while we have great teams in the government
###569 already, and that was proven once again last
###574 week with the landing, the successful landing of the
###576 Mars Rover, which was a phenomenal success, there
###582 are also a lot of really smart, talented folks in
###587 the private sector, in academia, and in
###590 the nonprofit world.
###592 And what if we were to team some of these best
###595 innovators outside of government with some of
###599 our brightest innovators inside of government,
###602 just imagine what we might accomplish!
###605 And that's where this program came in.
###608 We laid out five challenges.
###611 And we said, okay, who wants to tackle these?
###616 And as you've heard, the response was amazing.
###620 For the 18 fellowship spots, we received over
###623 700 applications representing tremendously
###627 diverse backgrounds and incredible talent.
###631 Applicants willing to drop everything, move here to
###633 D.C., and serve their country.
###637 And from that pool of talent, we have assembled
###640 the truly impressive teams that you're going to see here today.
###645 You're going to see what I mean in a moment.
###647 People from nuclear engineering, start-up
###650 businesses, and best selling books, these
###653 fellows are brimming with talent,
###656 accomplishment and courage.
###659 But before we introduce our new teams, let me just
###663 reach back for a quick moment 200 years to a
###667 British admiral, Horatio Nelson, now famous for his
###672 very brilliant Naval victories.
###676 He won battle after battle, often outgunned
###680 and outnumbered, and he did it because unlike many
###685 admirals before or since, he didn't depend on direct
###690 command over every ship.
###693 And he didn't stick to textbook tactics that
###697 everyone had used for years and years.
###701 Instead, Nelson discussed strategy with his captains
###704 well in advance and set for them broad goals that
###709 he expected them to achieve in whatever battle
###712 they would find themselves.
###715 His approach meant that when his fleet engaged
###719 another, his captains knew immediately how to work
###722 together, react quickly, and to work towards those
###726 overall goals that Nelson had set without waiting
###730 for specific orders.
###732 It meant more brains and more creativity were
###736 unleashed on Nelson's side than on his adversaries'.
###740 Now, we're asking you the same thing.
###745 We have set out these five broad goals and we're
###748 counting on your smarts and your creativity in
###751 figuring out ways how to reach these goals better
###755 and more efficiently.
###757 New ways for our government to operate
###760 using ideas that right now most of us can't even imagine.
###766 We're counting on you to think boldly, fail early,
###771 learn quickly, and above all, dare to do great things!
###778 Do good things!
###781 And now it's time to hear about each of our great
###785 projects today and meet the teams that are going
###788 to be powering them.
###790 To kick things off, would you please welcome
###792 Peter Levin, the Chief Technology Officer of the
###796 Department of Veterans Affairs
###798 and Farzad Mostashari, the National Coordinator for Health
###802 Information and Technology at the Department of
###804 Health and Human Services.
###806 Take it away, guys!
###806 [applause]
###815 Peter Levin: Well, hello and good morning, everybody.
###817 Audience Members: Good morning.
###819 Peter Levin: We are so happy to be here and to
###821 kick off this discussion of the Presidential
###824 Innovation Fellows with a conversation about Blue Button.
###828 Some of you might have already heard about Blue
###829 Button but in the next couple of minutes, ten or so,
###831 we're going to explain to you why we've done this
###834 and what's coming next.
###835 It's so exciting I can hardly talk ...
###838 but I'm going to try.
###841 If you have a parent, if you are a parent, you
###846 might have a partner that you care about or a pulse
###849 you want to keep going for a long time, then you know
###852 what a pain it is to get your medical records.
###857 So imagine this situation just as a "for instance."
###860 You have an elderly parent, an elderly mom,
###863 and she is living in Washington, D.C. a couple
###865 months ago, she is relatively healthy but she
###869 has got to take a few meds every day, she has got to
###870 remember to do this every day, and all of a sudden a
###873 ferocious storm comes along and knocks out the
###876 power to her house.
###878 Now, it ends up that that's not really the crisis.
###882 The crisis occurs a couple minutes later when she
###884 falls down and she has to go to the emergency room.
###889 And she can't remember her meds.
###891 She is not going to remember the name.
###893 She is not going to remember the dosage.
###894 She is not going to remember the frequency,
###896 how often she has to take it.
###898 And you know something?
###899 You're not going to remember it either.
###902 Let me give you another "for instance."
###904 What if you're a doc, imagine you're a doctor
###906 and a patient comes in to see you and the guy seems
###909 okay, he seems smart, he seems lucid.
###912 He's got a problem, that's why he's there, and you're
###915 going through the medical history and he remembers
###917 everything, he has got most of it written down,
###919 but not all of it, but okay, it's time for the
###920 physical exam, the guy takes off his shirt and
###923 there's a big scar right down the middle.
###925 The guy says, Wow! What's that?
###927 He says, oh, my God, I forgot to tell you, I had
###929 open heart surgery a couple of years ago . . .
###931 you know, something like that would be good to know! Right?
###935 So now we have these problems, so now we have
###943 these problems of complexity.
###945 So if you're a doctor, you have got to keep all of
###949 this stuff in your head, you're dealing with
###951 hundreds or thousands of patients.
###953 If you're a patient, you may have dozens of doctors
###957 and they all need the same information.
###959 And you know something?
###961 The combination of that complexity, thousands of
###964 diagnoses, thousands of conditions, thousands of
###967 medications, dozens of doctors, combine that with
###972 paper and people, this is a losing combination, folks.
###977 This is not where you want to be.
###981 But I have good news.
###983 The days of having to remember everything or
###986 remember where you put everything, are numbered.
###989 The days of having to schlep around a suitcase --
###992 I've seen pictures of this-- schlep around a suitcase
###995 full of the medicines you have taken,
###998 your surgical history, the immunizations you and your
###1001 kids have had, the films of your radiological
###1005 studies, all that stuff is about to move from
###1010 physical atoms to electrons as we're going
###1013 to put it in the cloud.
###1015 Those days are numbered.
###1016 In 2010, two years ago this month, President
###1021 Obama announced that the Department of Veterans
###1024 Affairs, where I work, is going to make the personal
###1028 health record of veterans available online with
###1032 something called Blue Button.
###1035 Blue Button was and is still today an
###1038 incredibly simple idea.
###1040 It basically just puts electronic information in
###1044 the hands of veterans safely, reliably,
###1049 conveniently, stuff that we all would want for ourselves.
###1055 So in the words of President Obama, with the
###1058 push of a button, your records are downloaded,
###1062 and you can share them with your doctor or with
###1064 other people you trust.
###1066 All we did really was put the name where the name
###1070 is supposed to go.
###1071 Medications and a list of medications.
###1073 Penicillin, even if it wasn't spelled right, goes
###1076 in the medications part.
###1078 And sore throat?
###1079 Well, that's a problem.
###1080 That's maybe why you are in the doctor's office
###1081 today, we just listed that as well.
###1084 The trick -- this is not a hard technical problem, right?
###1087 The trick really is to break through the red
###1089 tape, the can'ts and the don'ts and I don't wannas
###1093 and what about this and all about that, right?
###1096 Was to make people aware that it wasn't a
###1099 technology problem and that the clinical, the
###1102 operational, the patient impact was immeasurable.
###1105 And we did.
###1107 So you might say, well, jeez, I mean, all you've
###1109 done is give some silly ASCII files, the kind of
###1112 files that any person can read on a screen or on a
###1115 mobile device, all you've done is give that to
###1118 people and put it, oh, my God, you put it in the
###1121 hands of patients? Really?
###1125 And yet that's exactly what we did.
###1127 We took that file and we said it's available to you.
###1130 And we've done it now 1 million times!
###1134 [applause]
###1142 So just a few days after President
###1144 Obama's announcement, not only did the VA make their
###1148 Blue Button available, so did CMS, so did DOD, and
###1152 shortly thereafter, a lot of our private sector
###1156 partners are now making their Blue Buttons
###1158 available, too.
###1162 Now today fast forward two years later, thanks to
###1165 Director Berry's leadership, all of the
###1167 carriers of federal health insurance, all the people
###1170 that insure all the folks that work for the federal
###1172 government, they're going to make a Blue Button available.
###1175 Thank you, very much!
###1178 Large software companies of your acquittance have
###1181 readers, large insurers that you probably know or
###1185 even belong to are going to say -- are going to
###1187 open up the floodgates on that data.
###1190 Last month 80,000 people just at the VA alone
###1194 downloaded their personal health records.
###1196 That number is going up and to the right.
###1199 And as I said, in less than two years a million
###1202 people have already used the Blue Button
###1204 successfully and happily.
###1207 Now, if you're Todd Park, you say, a million people?
###1211 That's amazing!
###1212 We should have some Presidential innovation
###1213 fellows to help to make it bigger.
###1215 And if you are Dr. Farzad Mostashari, you say,
###1219 eh, it's good.
###1221 It's a nice start.
###1222 Farzad Mostashari: It's a good start, Peter.
###1223 It's a good start.
###1226 Peter Levin: Farzad?
###1227 Farzad Mostashari: Thank you.
###1227 Peter Levin: What are we going to do next?
###1230 Farzad Mostashari: So now what?
###1235 The VA brilliantly moved simply to be able to make
###1241 this information available to veterans and as we
###1245 heard, a million veterans have downloaded their information.
###1249 And where the VA led, others have now followed.
###1253 So how do we take this to the next level?
###1256 We have an MVP, right?
###1259 And for you startup folks out there,
###1260 this minimally viable product.
###1264 But it's not really a product.
###1268 We're not trying to get 10 million of some thing sold
###1274 or a hundred million.
###1277 It's an idea.
###1278 It's an attitude that says it's okay to get
###1283 your own record.
###1287 It's an attitude among providers of openness.
###1291 Openness means letting other people help.
###1294 When you are talking about open government, when
###1296 we're talking about open data, when we're talking
###1298 about opening, that means letting others help.
###1303 And in this case, who are we letting help?
###1308 The patient.
###1309 We're letting the patient and the people who love them help.
###1314 So it's an attitude, and it's an action.
###1318 Let's turn Blue Button from a noun to a verb.
###1323 So I can say, you know, I was talking to my mom last
###1325 night, I'm kind of worried about her, yeah, she's
###1327 going to Blue Button those scans, and we're going to
###1329 send them to my uncle.
###1330 That's what we want to do.
###1332 We want to make it an action.
###1334 To do that, we're going to need help to take this to
###1337 the next level up on three fronts, that's why
###1343 we got three fellows.
###1344 [laughter]
###1345 Each of you guys have got to solve one
###1347 of these problems, right?
###1349 The first is people, we've got to change those attitudes.
###1353 You've got to know that you can get it and
###1355 increasingly today, right now, you can't.
###1359 If I go all over America and I say to one of you
###1365 ask your doctor.
###1366 In fact, ask your doctor!
###1369 Do that. Say what's in my record?
###1373 Believe me. Trust me.
###1374 Trust Leon Rodriguez, the head of the Office of
###1376 Civil Rights, it's not against HIPAA.
###1381 It's not against HIPAA to ask for your own records.
###1383 It actually is your right.
###1384 But we need to stimulate that demand.
###1386 We need to have more people asking, saying can
###1388 I get a copy of my own records?
###1391 If you're on Medicare now you can get a
###1393 copy of your records.
###1394 If you're a veteran now you can get a copy of your records.
###1396 Increasingly we're going to work with those who
###1400 hold the data to change those attitudes and make it available.
###1403 Stimulate the demand, the attitudes on the one hand
###1406 and the access on the other hand.
###1409 And this is the most fun part, well, it's the
###1411 fellow I'm going to be working with, the most fun
###1414 is going to be not just having it be data that,
###1417 yes, you can print and you can read and you can have,
###1419 and you can share, but things you can do with it now.
###1423 To have that data, that information and the
###1427 incentives turn into combustible magic
###1430 in the startup crucible.
###1432 To have people help you use your data to do things
###1436 you want to do.
###1438 I want to manage my health.
###1439 I want to connect to other people.
###1440 I want to manage my health care finances.
###1442 I want to get a second opinion.
###1443 I want to find a clinical trial.
###1445 I want to be able to do things.
###1447 And for that we need to not just liberate the data
###1449 but we need to make it so that those entrepreneurs
###1452 can come in an openness to that innovation.
###1455 And that's what we're going to do.
###1458 So that's our goal.
###1460 Is to take the million, and call it a good start,
###1464 and say how do we take it to 10 million by next year
###1467 and a hundred million two years from now.
###1474 So meet the Blue Button Team.
###1478 I talked to Ryan Panchadsaram on the phone
###1485 as we were interviewing these phenomenal -- hang
###1487 on, I'm going to praise you for a sec --
###1488 [laughter]
###1496 -- as we were interviewing these
###1498 amazing, and it was like amazing candidate after
###1500 amazing candidate, we were like, oh, we've got to get
###1502 that one, oh, how could we do better?
###1503 And then I talked to Ryan, and, yeah, he graduated
###1506 from UC Berkeley with engineering and he has
###1509 this real design sensibility and he worked
###1512 on, he was in charge of Microsoft Outlook for Mac
###1516 and getting that, all of you all love that, right?
###1520 -- the design sense that he won the 2012 Google's
###1524 International Design Information Design
###1526 Visualization competition.
###1528 And he's this amazing guy.
###1530 But what got me goose bumps was when he said
###1535 when I was 18, I talked to my parents -- and we go
###1539 back and we started with veterans, we go back to
###1541 veterans -- and he said, my mom is a marine, my dad
###1546 was in the Air Force and served in the Navy, and I
###1549 always thought that I would join the military,
###1553 that I would be in the armed forces and the service.
###1557 And my parents said to me, son, we did this so you
###1562 could serve your country a different way.
###1567 And he said, when I saw the Presidential
###1569 Innovation Fellow opportunity, I knew this
###1572 was my way to serve.
###1574 Ryan, come on up. Whooo!
###1578 Congratulations.
###1579 [applause]
###1588 Peter Levin: So the guy who I deal with
###1591 a lot at OSTP besides the CTO of the United States
###1593 Todd Park, is this guy standing over in the
###1595 corner, John Farmer, calls me up some Friday afternoon.
###1599 John is very direct.
###1600 You just do what he says.
###1602 It's easier, right?
###1603 [laughter]
###1605 He says, listen, dude, I got bad news for you.
###1607 You've got until Monday to cut the pile of resumés.
###1610 And, you know, there were 700 all together.
###1611 I don't know how many were Blue Button, there was 300?
###1614 I mean, there was a lot, right?
###1616 And he says, you know, how hard can it be?
###1618 Okay, 300 resumés.
###1619 Oh, my God!
###1621 The same experience that Farzad has, right?
###1625 And then I run into a resumé which just bowled me over.
###1632 The guy's name is Matt McCall.
###1633 I know this name.
###1634 I know who that guy is!
###1635 I remember reading about this.
###1636 That wasn't the only one.
###1638 And you're going through it, and what we didn't
###1640 about too much was that a lot of what we're trying
###1643 to accomplish here is not build proprietary silos of
###1647 secret code, of secret sauce that only we have,
###1651 only the government has.
###1652 We're trying to make this as open as possible.
###1653 Literally put it into the public domain.
###1655 Literally make it open source.
###1656 Matt McCall did that already on the platform
###1659 that actually is the driver of Blue Button.
###1662 So Matt, would you please come up.
###1664 I'm so glad I found you.
###1666 Farzad Mostashari: Henry, come up, too.
###1668 Matt McCall: Thanks, very much.
###1671 [applause]
###1673 Peter Levin: Okay, so that was the easy one. Right?
###1675 the harder one was a guy, you know, finally Farmer
###1679 is, I know he's going to call me Monday morning, I
###1681 know this is going to be an unpleasant
###1682 conversation, they mostly are even when I have good news.
###1684 [laughter]
###1688 So I mean I've got like the top three, right?
###1690 And it's really hard, I've got this checklist, excel
###1692 spreadsheet, I'm an engineer, right?
###1694 So you know you model all this stuff.
###1696 And then I'm thinking, you know, what I really want,
###1699 you know, a most abstract thing, what I really want
###1700 is a guy who like knows the provider/payor world,
###1704 that, you know, has been to places that I've heard
###1707 of, it's like if I'm going to hire somebody who I
###1710 don't actually know very well and never heard of
###1710 before, and then I get this phone call.
###1713 It's like, hey, you know something?
###1715 You've got somebody in your pile of 300 resumés
###1718 that you probably want to talk to and the guy's
###1719 resumé was right in front of me as I'm getting this
###1721 phone call, it's like, oh, my God!
###1723 So Henry Wei -- please come up and join us --
###1725 [applause]
###1730 -- his last title at a major American
###1733 health care provider was Director of Clinical Innovations.
###1738 But, oh, wait there's more, undergraduate in the
###1741 ivy league, medical degree from Cornell.
###1744 And this guy knows, this guy has forgotten more
###1746 than all of us together know about health informatics.
###1750 So can you imagine the dream team, the people who
###1754 build the platform, the people who are going to
###1756 stimulate customer demand, and people are going to go
###1758 around to all the providers and say, it's
###1760 okay, you can do this.
###1763 And in fact we can do this together.
###1765 Thank you so much for being here today.
###1767 We're so excited about this.
###1769 [cheering and applause]
###1775 Farzad Mostashari: Next up we have Sean Greene from the Small Business
###1779 Association to kick off the next group.
###1789 Sean Greene: Everyone, thanks for coming.
###1790 I'm Sean Greene.
###1791 I run the Investment and Innovation Programs at the
###1792 Small Business Administration, SBA, and
###1795 I'm here to talk about Project RFP-EZ which is a
###1798 project to make it easier for startups to sell to
###1802 the federal government and to make procurement of
###1805 federal I.T. better, cheaper and faster.
###1809 So to put it in context, I think everybody in the
###1811 room and those watching at home know that
###1814 particularly in the world of the web and mobile
###1816 development, costs have come down dramatically, 5X or more.
###1823 And personally as someone who formerly was a web
###1826 entrepreneur and investor, what I've seen is a
###1829 massive disconnect between how technology is being
###1832 used in the private sector and how it is being
###1835 used in government.
###1837 And I see that manifested itself in the frustration
###1840 of entrepreneurs who have tried to sell to the
###1843 federal government and literally see a quote
###1845 there from an entrepreneur who said no matter how
###1848 fast or better, and cheaper my product, it's
###1850 just impossible to sell to the federal government.
###1853 I see frustration in venture capitalists who
###1856 advise their portfolio companies don't bother
###1860 trying to sell to the government.
###1861 It's too much time.
###1863 It's not worth the energy.
###1864 It's not worth the bandwidth.
###1866 And if investors are saying this, and telling
###1868 their portfolio companies not to bother selling to
###1871 the largest customer in the world, then we have
###1873 something fundamentally wrong.
###1875 At the same time we see opportunity and I will
###1877 pick on Todd as others have to give an example of
###1882 when Todd was CTO at health and human services,
###1886 a team within HHS came to him saying, Todd, we've
###1889 got a problem.
###1890 We've got an important need here.
###1892 The initial estimate on the technology to serve
###1895 this project is $5 million.
###1897 We just don't have that much in our budget.
###1900 And so Todd worked with the team, pointed them to
###1903 look at cloud-based solutions.
###1906 And as a result of that, the team was able to go
###1910 ahead, find some innovative companies that
###1913 could deliver the solution for just over $400,000,
###1918 10 X cheaper.
###1920 And so the opportunity and the challenge in front of
###1922 us is how do we replicate that.
###1924 How do we make that happen more often.
###1927 And why should we care?
###1928 Because there is a tremendous opportunity for
###1931 a win/win here.
###1932 For the federal government the win is an opportunity
###1936 to save taxpayer dollars or get far more bang for the buck.
###1941 And with federal I.T.
###1942 procurement we're talking about $80 billion.
###1946 A massive, massive opportunity.
###1948 But it's also an opportunity for the
###1950 innovative startups who, by the way, are the ones
###1953 who create all of the net new jobs in the economy.
###1957 And so as we -- as I've traveled around the
###1959 country talking to hundreds, more than a
###1960 thousand entrepreneurs, and we asked them what
###1963 barriers they're facing to growing their companies
###1966 and creating jobs, we heard about things like
###1968 access to capital, changing immigration
###1970 policy, And we're excited about the success and
###1973 progress we've made.
###1975 But what I've also heard is, hey, make it easier to
###1979 sell to the federal government. Right?
###1982 People have told me make it easier.
###1984 I know my product is better, cheaper, but help
###1987 me get my foot in the door.
###1990 And so the opportunity we have in front of us is to
###1992 help take the success story that I pointed to
###1995 Todd and let's replicate that and scale that at a
###1998 much bigger level and let's help a lot more
###2001 innovative companies get their foot in the door.
###2005 So to understand how to do that, let's start with
###2008 understanding the problem.
###2009 The fundamental problem is complexity.
###2012 So here is how the federal procurement process works
###2014 for the uninitiated.
###2015 It's all clearly mapped out right there --
###2017 [laughter]
###2018 -- with, you know, an example from the
###2019 Department of Defense.
###2021 So, you know, your startup who is already working,
###2024 you know, ridiculous hours, where do you begin?
###2027 Startups don't have dedicated teams to help
###2030 navigate the federal procurement process.
###2032 And at its core we have a problem when the process
###2037 for $150,000 software procurement works the same
###2041 way that it does for $150 million procurement.
###2046 More broadly as we think about the problem what we
###2049 see is a fundamental gap between the innovative
###2052 startups and federal buyers.
###2055 So how do they find each other, right?
###2057 Most federal buyers don't hang out on TechCrunch to
###2060 find out what's the latest and what's happening
###2062 with innovative startups.
###2064 The startups don't hang out on Fed Biz Ops
###2066 or Federal Register.
###2068 Even if they know where to find each other, what
###2071 we're seeing is they speak different languages.
###2073 Startups don't speak government acronymeese, right?
###2076 People looking to do web development for the
###2078 government may have to know how to search on
###2081 terms like "content information distribution platform."
###2084 So how do we get over the language barrier?
###2087 And then how do we challenge the issue of
###2090 just different timeframes. Right?
###2092 The traditional RFP process that works in the
###2095 federal government is three lifetimes for a startup.
###2099 How do we address those challenges?
###2101 So our solution is something we're calling
###2104 RFP-EZ. Right?
###2106 So RFP is request for proposal, that's the
###2109 traditional way government initiates a contracting procedure.
###2112 We're borrowing from a successful example, the
###2115 1040EZ and the metaphor, right, that we all know
###2118 that took something fairly complicated and said, hey,
###2121 for a subset of the people who don't need all that
###2124 complexity, how do we make something easier to work.
###2128 And we said let's bring that concept to procurement.
###2133 Specifically we'll start with federal I.T.
###2135 And at its core what we're trying to do is
###2138 build a marketplace.
###2139 A marketplace of buyers and sellers,
###2142 to bring together fragmented buyers and sellers to
###2145 make transactions happen.
###2147 And to the economists in the room you know this is
###2149 all about lowering transaction costs.
###2152 But to the entrepreneurs in the room it's about
###2154 making it faster and simpler.
###2157 So we're going to do that by focusing on a couple
###2159 of different things.
###2161 First we're going to focus on discovery.
###2163 How do we help the buyers and sellers find each other.
###2167 With an opportunity to leverage things like
###2170 online directories, simple video demos of products
###2174 and services to help each other know what's available.
###2178 And as appropriate, in-person demo days that
###2180 we know have worked very effectively in the
###2182 private sector, right?
###2184 Because in the discovery process you've got a
###2186 chicken and egg problem, right?
###2189 If there aren't enough government buyers, you
###2191 can't get the innovative startups to come.
###2193 If you don't have innovative startups with
###2195 good products, the buyers won't come.
###2197 So simplifying a process by which you can
###2200 communicate helps that discovery process.
###2203 At the end of the day, though, what we really
###2205 want to do is to drive more transactions.
###2208 And so changing and creating templates and
###2210 simplified processes for easier transactions are
###2213 critically important as well.
###2215 So we have a screen shot here of one specific
###2218 module that the team has been focused on that we're
###2220 calling statement of work composer.
###2223 The whole idea here is a simple templated solution
###2228 that creates statements of work for
###2230 a specific procurement.
###2233 Why this matters is to the program officer who wants
###2236 to do the buy, by leveraging a template,
###2238 half of the work is already done.
###2240 And they can get it done faster.
###2242 To contracting officers, they then know that the
###2245 language in this has been reviewed by a group of
###2248 their peers to make sure it is valid, legitimate,
###2251 et cetera.
###2252 And then to the small business, it's written in
###2254 plain English in terms friendly to them,
###2258 understandable to them to make it happen.
###2261 So I point to a statement of work composer not as an
###2265 idea of something that we want to do, but I'm
###2268 incredibly pleased to say the team is already ready
###2273 to ship this product.
###2274 So in the spirit of rapid innovation, they said,
###2277 let's not -- no pressure to the other teams --
###2279 [laughter]
###2280 -- you know, we haven't shipped anything
###2281 yet, but the team has already written the
###2284 code for this.
###2285 For the developer's paying attention, they'll be
###2288 posting the code to GitHub later this afternoon.
###2291 And very much in the spirit of let's get
###2293 something up and running, let's get people to kick
###2295 the tires, give feedback and we'll rapidly innovate
###2297 and improve things from there.
###2299 So with that as a segue, let me turn to the team.
###2302 So we have a phenomenal team.
###2306 So you heard the dream team metaphor, there are
###2308 going to be all kinds of great metaphors coming.
###2310 At its core what we're really seeing is each one
###2312 of these individuals are successful entrepreneurs
###2315 and successful technologists.
###2317 So let me introduce them now.
###2319 Let me start and lead off with Clay Johnson.
###2322 Clay, come on down!
###2323 [applause]
###2328 So Clay is a successful entrepreneur.
###2331 A founder of Blue State Digital.
###2333 He also is the Director of Sunlight Labs at the
###2335 Sunlight Foundation where he led a community over
###2337 2,000 developers building apps and functionalities
###2342 it helps to make the government more
###2342 open and transparent.
###2344 He's a best selling author.
###2345 Recently released the "Information Diet."
###2349 And was, in 2009 won Google and O'Reilly Medias
###2352 Award for Open Source Organizer of the Year.
###2356 But most importantly, he is the proud father of an
###2361 adorable seven-week-old Felix, who is in the
###2365 house today. Felix?
###2367 [cheering and appplause]
###2369 Hey, quiet, quiet, clap
###2370 quietly, Felix might be asleep.
###2373 And so when we were thinking about what
###2375 profile do we want in our innovation fellows, we
###2377 said, well, where can we find someone who is not
###2379 going to be sleeping for the next six months?
###2380 [laughter]
###2382 Hum. So, welcome, Clay.
###2385 Next I want to call up Jed Wood.
###2387 Jed, come on up.
###2387 [applause]
###2393 So Jed is coming in from Chicago, Illinois.
###2396 Jed has more than ten years of experience kind
###2398 of merging the worlds of design and user
###2400 experience and programming.
###2403 Both critically important to this effort.
###2405 He actually, at the first-ever White House
###2410 Code-A-Thon, was Top Mention in that effort.
###2414 Also a successful entrepreneur, has led the
###2417 effort or started, created a startup called LimeChili
###2422 that has already spun off three different apps that
###2424 have been acquired.
###2425 And with a name like LimeChili, we're going to
###2427 turn to him as the brand guru.
###2430 And Jed lives in Chicago, as I mentioned, with his
###2434 wife and two daughters.
###2436 To the metaphor that we had before I only have one
###2439 daughter who, Steve, is 13 going on 17.
###2442 So good luck with two!
###2444 And then finally I would like to call up Adam Becker.
###2447 [applause]
###2452 So Adam comes in from Oakland where he is
###2456 an avid cyclist and lives with his two cats,
###2459 slightly less challenging than the two daughters,
###2461 but we know it's work.
###2462 So, again, another great example of somebody who is
###2465 a talented entrepreneur and developer.
###2468 He was the founder and CTO of a company GovHub that
###2472 focused on helping stakeholders at the local
###2475 level improve communications on key
###2477 issues of important to them.
###2479 Has also had a ton of web or despite his youth or I
###2484 should say probably because of his youth --
###2486 [laughter]
###2487 -- but a ton of web development projects
###2489 under his belt already, and his first website he
###2493 ever built was for his junior high punk rock band.
###2498 So everybody is going to say that their team are
###2500 rock stars, but we have a legitimate punk rock star
###2503 on our team.
###2506 So, welcome the team.
###2506 [applause]
###2511 And I would also like to give a
###2512 shout-out to Ashon Wardak who is somewhere in the
###2514 room who is on my team at SBA, Ashon is also an
###2517 entrepreneur and technologist who is the
###2520 point person working with the team on RPZ-EZ.
###2524 So quickly, here is our game plan, here's what
###2527 we're trying to accomplish.
###2528 So in the short-term we want to walk before we can
###2531 run so we want to focus this effort on I.T.
###2534 specifically and in particular on one targeted
###2536 sector web development.
###2538 What we want to do in the next six months is build
###2541 an app and a working alpha, let's run with a
###2544 handful of actual procurements through this
###2546 process.
###2548 Let's have some case studies that demonstrate
###2550 how we can save money, get better solutions for taxpayers.
###2555 And then let's create the blueprint to scale.
###2560 Beyond that, what we're trying to accomplish is
###2562 attract new businesses into government contracting.
###2566 Save significant money.
###2568 And then finally, close that gap that I talked
###2570 about, and Jeff Zients talked about it at the
###2573 beginning as well, of how the private sector uses
###2576 technology and the government.
###2578 So finally an ask to everyone out there here's
###2581 how you can help.
###2582 First of all, follow us on Twitter, you see our
###2585 Twitter handle there or you'll see it on the next page.
###2589 If you're a developer, this is all on an open platform.
###2592 Check out what we're doing and contribute on GitHub.
###2595 Folks in the federal government, if you are a
###2597 contracting officer we need your input.
###2600 Kick the tires.
###2601 Give us the feedback on what matters to you.
###2603 Federal buyers, come in and be a beta buyer on the platform.
###2607 And to small businesses, particularly in web
###2609 development, contact us.
###2611 We'd love to have you participate and join.
###2613 So that's project RFP-EZ.
###2615 Thanks for coming.
###2616 We look forward to your input going forward.
###2618 [applause]
###2619 And again on any of these e-mail us if
###2622 you're interested at the following e-mail -- sorry,
###2625 projectRFP-EZ@SBA.gov.
###2629 Thank you.
###2629 [applause]
###2635 And so now I want to turn the mic over
###2637 to Macon Phillips to talk about MyGov.
###2640 Macon is the Director of Digital Strategy here at
###2643 the White House.
###2645 [applause]
###2649 Macon Phillips: All right.
###2650 Welcome everyone, welcome to the White House.
###2651 You're getting a sense of why sometimes we call this
###2654 room the South Beach Auditorium!
###2655 [laughter]
###2658 But I'm the halfway mark so hang in there.
###2661 I'm here to talk to you about project MyGov.
###2666 And project MyGov is an effort to reimagine how
###2668 citizens interact with government through an
###2670 experience designed around their needs but
###2674 not our bureaucracy.
###2676 And to kind of give you a sense of what I mean,
###2677 I'm going to talk to you about Alice.
###2681 Just as sort of persona we're going to use to
###2682 illustrate this, Alice is married, she's got two kids.
###2687 She served in Iraq for four years.
###2689 She's a veteran.
###2690 She started her own small business.
###2692 She is in catering.
###2694 And she owns her own home in my hometown of
###2696 Huntsville, Alabama.
###2699 There is a lot of government information
###2700 relevant to her.
###2702 Of course, she goes to the Veterans Affairs for
###2704 information about her benefits.
###2706 She'll probably interact with the Department of
###2708 Education for information about student loans.
###2712 Of course, there is the Consumer Product Safety
###2713 Commission that is going to help her keep tabs on
###2715 product recalls and cribs and all sorts of issues.
###2721 There is the Small Business Administration
###2723 for information about loans and other support
###2725 for her business.
###2727 And then say you have got something like the
###2728 Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that is
###2730 going to have resources about her mortgage or a
###2733 way for her to file a complaint.
###2735 She has to go to each of these places to
###2738 get that information.
###2739 And sometimes, she may not even know that these exist.
###2742 And that is a problem.
###2745 That is also just the tip of the iceberg.
###2747 The government has all sorts of things
###2750 relevant to her.
###2751 They are scattered and they are buried deep
###2753 within this bureaucracy.
###2754 And that is the key question of MyGov.
###2757 How can we identify those things and bring them to her?
###2761 Now, we first tried to tackle this problem with
###2764 FIRSTGOV, which whose mission was to provide the
###2768 public with easy one stop access for all federal
###2770 information and services.
###2772 And I think twelve years later we can all agree
###2773 that FIRSTGOV was certainly not the last dot gov.
###2776 But that is not to say that websites are bad.
###2779 We have actually had some really great examples of
###2781 websites in the last few years.
###2783 Take the recent student aid.gov that education
###2786 just put out.
###2787 It is a great example of user centric design that
###2790 helps people find the right student aid
###2791 resources based on their needs.
###2794 Of course you have got Health Care.Gov.
###2797 Which for the first time you can find all of your
###2799 public and private health care coverage options in
###2801 the same place.
###2803 And it too is built around users.
###2805 Or Consumer Finance.Gov.
###2807 Here is a site for the Consumer Financial
###2810 Protection Bureau that offers a range of
###2812 resources to make, to empower consumers and also
###2815 a way for them to file complaints.
###2818 Each offers powerful tools to the user.
###2821 And each is organized around a regular person,
###2823 not a subject matter expert.
###2825 With that said, there is still more we can do.
###2829 These are three distinct sites produced
###2831 by different agencies.
###2833 And although Alice might end up at Student Aid.Gov
###2835 with her kid, researching college affordability
###2838 options, she might not know about some of the
###2840 benefits relevant to her at Health Care.Gov or that
###2843 she can actually get help with her mortgage at
###2845 Consumer Finance.Gov.
###2847 There is not an efficient super structure across the
###2849 federal web space to help her discover these things.
###2852 And of course as I said earlier this is the
###2853 tip of the iceberg.
###2856 The web has brought incredible efficiency to the
###2857 relationship between government and citizens.
###2859 You can pay taxes in your pajamas.
###2861 You can go research energy efficient light bulbs or
###2863 laundry machines at Energy Star.Gov.
###2866 You can even track a robot on Mars.
###2871 All right.
###2872 So there is a NASA fan.
###2873 [laughter]
###2874 All right.
###2876 There is a lot to discover and shifting that burden
###2878 from the citizen back to the government is what we
###2880 are trying to do here.
###2882 But back to Alice.
###2883 I want to stress that we are not here to create yet
###2886 another website that Alice has to remember.
###2889 MyGov is a service that goes out into the federal
###2891 bureaucracy, identifies the information and
###2894 services relevant to her based on her needs.
###2897 Brings that together into a personalized experience
###2900 and that we can present perhaps through it's own
###2903 stand alone dashboard or perhaps in the contexts of
###2905 sites that she is already visiting.
###2907 And this is a pretty big challenge.
###2909 But the good news is, it is building on momentum
###2913 that is already out there.
###2913 Of course, we have got USA.gov, which does, has
###2916 done incredible work laying down the groundwork
###2917 for how we organize information around topics
###2920 rather than bureaucracy.
###2922 And I am sure many of you have heard about our
###2923 colleagues across the pond at the government, United
###2926 Kingdoms Government Digital Service that have
###2928 made some remarkable achievements with Gov.UK.
###2932 Now, both of these makes search a central part of
###2934 their strategy and that is going to serve as a key
###2935 component of ours moving forward.
###2938 But our bigger picture is truly a no wrong door approach.
###2942 Where every federal touch point participates in this
###2944 agency agnostic people centered service.
###2947 And we are not just solving for today.
###2949 This approach also allows us to add a new dimension
###2952 as people's information and needs change over time.
###2957 Imagine if Alice creates a custom profile focused on
###2959 her interest, one that enables notifications and
###2961 alert, if contents she saw yesterday changes tomorrow
###2965 like a new product recall or veterans benefit.
###2968 So what is this going to look like?
###2971 In one month we are planning to have a basic
###2973 prototype of the MyGov platform.
###2975 In three months, define this basic persona
###2978 standards for personalizing services and information.
###2981 And in six months have at least two important
###2983 citizen and government interactions using the
###2985 platform and a personalized notification
###2987 center for government services and information.
###2991 Now, this is the fun part.
###2992 Let's talk about who is going to do it.
###2994 Kara. Come on up.
###2996 [applause]
###3005 Kara DeFrias' enthusiasm for creating
###3007 great experiences is contagious whether she is
###3009 working on the Oscars, with the Gold Medal
###3011 winning US Women's Soccer team
###3013 [applause]
###3015 Or taxes.
###3017 [laughter]
###3019 At Turbo Tax, we got her to come here
###3021 all the way from San Diego to work with us on making
###3023 user experiences awesome which if you ever paid
###3025 your taxes, you can understand how it could
###3027 not be awesome.
###3028 But she knows, she knows how to get it done.
###3030 This three time cancer survivor has got a knack
###3032 for speaking to user in their language, tapping
###3034 into their emotions, and relentlessly pushes for
###3037 what is best for them.
###3039 Phil. All right.
###3040 [applause]
###3045 Phil Ashlock is steeped in the open
###3047 government community from years building open source
###3049 civic infrastructure at Open Plans and sharing it
###3051 through Civic Commons.
###3053 As a primary instigator behind the Community
###3055 Driven Open 311 Initiative, a service up
###3057 and running in a lot of cities including this one,
###3059 Washington, D.C., he has created, he has helped a
###3063 complete a common platform for citizen services that
###3065 is revolutionizing the way people interact with
###3067 government around the world.
###3069 He has got a gift for bringing people together
###3070 to solve complex challenges. Ben.
###3074 All right.
###3075 Ben Balter everyone.
###3077 [applause]
###3080 All right, man.
###3080 This guy is lightning in a bottle.
###3082 He is the kind of guy that has been hacking
###3084 government from the inside out already at places like
###3086 the CFPB, the Consumer Financial Protection
###3087 Bureau, and FCC.
###3089 All the while pursuing degrees in law and business.
###3092 Obviously, an under achiever.
###3093 [laughter]
###3095 Danny, come on up.
###3096 All right.
###3098 [applause]
###3100 So Danny Chapman brings his award
###3102 winning design shops and recent work at Rhode
###3104 Island's RI.Gov among many other sites.
###3107 And he has got that rare intersection of experience
###3111 with both design, but also empathy for user
###3114 experience with government services.
###3117 And finally we have got Greg.
###3119 [applause]
###3122 All right.
###3124 So Greg has made a career of creating products that
###3126 make information more accessible.
###3129 Most recently he was on the core team developing
###3130 USA Search Platform and his idea of relaxing with
###3133 a movie is building a custom application to
###3136 search I Tunes, Amazon, Netflix, and Hulu for the best options.
###3139 [laughter]
###3140 It is out there.
###3140 It is Cinidex.come with an I.
###3142 Right. All right. Cinidex with an I.
###3145 So any way we are looking for ideas from everyone.
###3148 For example, are you an expert in privacy?
###3151 We want, we want to talk to you.
###3153 Providing a level of personalization requires
###3155 knowing something about that person.
###3157 And this must be handled with a strong emphasis on
###3159 user permission, control, and transparency.
###3162 Have you had experience developing platforms like this?
###3165 We want to connect.
###3166 The bottom line is that even though this project
###3168 is called MyGov, the challenge is all of ours.
###3170 Yours, mine, and Alice's.
###3173 And we cannot wait to get to work.
###3175 So thank you everyone.
###3176 [applause]
###3180 All right. All right.
###3182 And now I am going to introduce Maura O'Neill,
###3185 who is the Chief Innovation Officer at
###3186 USAID, Maura?
###3189 Maura O'Neill: Thanks so much.
###3191 Thanks so much, Macon.
###3193 Hi, I am happy to be here.
###3195 And so excited to share this platform with these
###3197 amazing Presidential Innovation Fellows and the
###3200 awesome people that I get a chance to work with in
###3202 this administration.
###3204 As Macon said, my name is Maura O'Neill and I joined
###3206 administrator Raj Shah three years ago.
###3209 At AID, the US Agency for International Development.
###3214 USAID's development work is a key component of our
###3217 foreign policy along side with the defense work that
###3220 our military does and the diplomacy work that our
###3223 state does, our State Department does.
###3227 We know that our economic prosperity at home and our
###3230 own national security is at risk when one third of
###3234 the people in the world live in extreme poverty
###3237 and a million more live under oppressive
###3239 governments for which they don't have a hope to build
###3243 a better life for their, or their children.
###3245 Development as President Obama and Secretary
###3248 Clinton note is essential to advancing American
###3251 interests and solving global security problems
###3255 as diplomacy in defense.
###3257 Our job at USAID is to reduce that risk by being
###3261 relentlessly focused on finding ways
###3264 to deliver results.
###3266 Faster and more efficient than traditional development.
###3269 And humanitarian assistance has done.
###3273 So come back with me to that first week of work
###3276 that Raj and I were at.
###3278 It was Wednesday, it was late afternoon.
###3282 And across, flashed across our screens the
###3285 Haiti Earthquake. 7.0.
###3288 Turns out it ends up being the most, the largest
###3295 urban disaster in modern history.
###3297 It effected a third of the population.
###3300 And it claimed all, nearly a quarter of a million
###3303 peoples lives.
###3304 Since it was dusk, it would be morning before we
###3307 could assess the damage.
###3309 Could we land planes?
###3311 Could we dock ships?
###3312 How were we going to get help down there?
###3314 We worked all night.
###3316 It was the first of many.
###3318 We worked in lock step with other US government
###3320 agencies and our military to help Haiti.
###3324 The earthquake left a government in rubble, an
###3328 economy in shambles and people living in make
###3331 shift camps coping with enormous loss.
###3335 It also caused a cash crisis.
###3338 The earthquake destroyed nearly a third of all of
###3340 the branch, bank branches, and the ATM's.
###3345 But for over 90 percent of the Haitians, who didn't
###3349 have access to either one of those before the
###3350 earthquake, their life savings went down
###3353 with their house.
###3354 Their cash was buried hopelessly under thousands
###3358 and thousands of pounds of rubble.
###3361 So here they were with no ability to actually buy anything.
###3367 So imagine for a minute, what it meant if your
###3369 savings were wiped out in a second.
###3373 Walk with me and walk with the people in Haiti for a
###3375 second as we put ourselves in their shoes.
###3379 Their house has been destroyed, a loved one has
###3381 probably been killed, everything around you
###3385 seems to have crumbled.
###3387 And because your entire life's worth is your
###3390 assets and your cash, has been swept away
###3392 with the destruction.
###3393 You have no ability to buy food.
###3395 You have no ability to buy water.
###3397 And you have no ability to buy any supplies to
###3400 rebuild your house.
###3402 This cash crisis was one of the least understood
###3405 but hugely damaging effects of the earthquake.
###3409 I often think about this story and think how lucky
###3413 you and I are to live in a place that has a safe
###3417 place to store our money.
###3420 At AID, we know that financial inclusion and
###3423 financial infrastructure is critical for families
###3426 and economies to grow.
###3427 In our, in Haiti, where mobile phones were the
###3432 only thing left standing at the end of this
###3434 earthquake, we thought what if we could turn
###3438 every phone into a wallet?
###3440 A cash register?
###3441 A bank branch?
###3443 President Obama had challenged us to create a
###3446 world in which AID and aid is no longer necessary.
###3449 This was the kind of game changing innovation that
###3453 was going to be necessary.
###3455 Priya Jaisinghani and I, she is the Director of our
###3458 Mobile Solutions Team at USAID, lead an effort with
###3462 the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
###3465 The USAID Haiti office and local companies to build a
###3468 mobile monies platform in Haiti months
###3471 after the earthquake.
###3473 I was in Haiti just last month and excited to tell
###3476 you about the progress.
###3477 The Haitians celebrated the five millionth mobile
###3480 money transaction in less than two years.
###3483 So we have a long way to go in rebuilding the
###3485 country and people rebuilding their lives,
###3488 but we have a financial infrastructure that is
###3490 beginning to work.
###3492 To better explain why this is important and what it
###3494 means, let me introduce you to -- so this is what
###3499 a lot of the ATM's and bank branches look like
###3503 the day after the earthquake.
###3505 So let me introduce you to Martine.
###3508 Before the earth -- after the earthquake she had to
###3511 move 75 miles north of Port Au Prince to live
###3514 with her family.
###3515 Taking only what she could carry.
###3517 She made a living by selling food, soaps,
###3519 sponges, and other miscellaneous items.
###3523 She made a few dollars here and there.
###3525 But she didn't have anywhere to put it.
###3527 She carried around a bag of cash,
###3529 she stuffed it in her clothes.
###3531 But she lived in a state of fear.
###3533 Worrying every day that a thief or a stranger or
###3536 maybe somebody that had a little less than her would
###3540 steal that sum of money from her.
###3543 This began to change when Martine participated in
###3546 one of USAID programs with Mercy Corp.
###3549 She learned how to use mobile money and she sent
###3552 it back and forth with her family in Port Au Prince.
###3556 As a result of the training she received, she
###3558 decided to start using mobile money in her business.
###3561 To more efficiently collect fees, to deposit
###3564 her money in the bank, and for her products.
###3566 Just like we use credit cards in our businesses today.
###3570 Martine told us that mobile money is like
###3573 a safe for me.
###3575 Like a safe, it makes Martine feel
###3577 secure and empowered.
###3580 Like a safe, it keeps money close so Martine
###3582 doesn't have to travel to a bank.
###3585 And like a safe, it enables Martine to grow
###3587 her business and support her future.
###3590 Martine's story is not that unique in Haiti.
###3593 And electronic payments won't solve all
###3596 of her problems.
###3597 But it is helping her in profound ways.
###3600 If you only remember three things from this talk
###3602 today, I want you to remember that electronic
###3606 payments reduce transaction costs, they
###3610 reduce corruption and violence, and they enable
###3612 businesses to grow.
###3614 And these are the conditions necessary if
###3616 donors to create a world where donors are not needed.
###3622 Now think about the US for a moment.
###3625 The industrial revolution wouldn't have happened
###3628 without thriving commercial banks like Bank
###3631 of America, Wells Fargo, and thousands of community
###3633 banks around the US.
###3636 EBay might not have been the eBay powerhouse that
###3638 we know today if it weren't for Pay Pal.
###3641 Our economy depends on the ability to send and
###3644 receive monies seamlessly.
###3646 Your livelihood and mine depend on the ability to
###3649 save, invest money, and use credit and debt cards
###3653 in your wallet.
###3655 But we also know that this kind of thing
###3657 just doesn't happen.
###3659 Think back to the history of the credit card.
###3661 It actually took 50 years for the credit cards to
###3664 really become ubiquitous in the US.
###3667 People didn't trust credit cards, at least they
###3669 didn't know whether they should trust credit cards.
###3672 Not enough merchants took it.
###3674 But we don't have 50 years to wait to get people out
###3678 of extreme poverty and create new markets for
###3680 American products.
###3683 So let's see what is happening around the world.
###3687 The technology exists, the innovation payments
###3690 platform exist.
###3692 And here is a picture of the place in the world
###3696 that this is happening so well.
###3699 And that is Kenya.
###3700 And we are honored to have the ambassador to the US
###3703 from Kenya joining us here to today.
###3705 Kenya's M-Pesa mobile money product, 80 percent
###3709 of Kenyan adults use it as a way to store
###3712 and transfer money.
###3713 And they have done this in just five years.
###3715 Not 50 years.
###3717 80 percent of the adults are using it.
###3719 But this is one of the few platforms to
###3721 reach mass scale.
###3723 There is about 130 deployments of mobile
###3725 money and electronic platforms world wide that
###3728 are stalled.
###3729 They are stalled for various reasons.
###3731 But in large part they are stalled, because there
###3733 aren't any anchor tenants to this mobile money platform.
###3737 They are -- it is a network effect.
###3739 There needs to be huge volumes of transactions to
###3742 support the kinds of agents on every corner
###3745 just like there was to have an ATM machine
###3747 on every corner.
###3748 So we need to and can jump start these efforts to
###3752 find these anchor tenants for that mobile money mall.
###3755 Until today, cash was the only alternative.
###3758 And for those of us who live in the US, it seems
###3761 pretty easy, we go to the ATM, we get cash.
###3764 We don't put our lives at risk as we are storing our
###3767 money in our pockets or have, or have to use our
###3772 credit cards to actually buy things that are remote.
###3775 But at this unique moment in history when technology
###3778 allows us to envision a world where everybody can
###3780 soon keep their money electronically, safely,
###3784 soundly and together build a better and stronger
###3786 economy, that is what we are about.
###3789 So I am so excited to launch the 20 Percent
###3793 Initiative today.
###3794 Which aims to reduce 20 percent of the cost with
###3797 cash based programs across the US government and put
###3801 these tools in the hands of the poorest people
###3803 in the world.
###3804 At USAID we are proud that we have taken bold steps
###3808 to motivate a change in the way our partners and
###3811 we do business.
###3812 We continue to use our budget as a force for
###3814 good, creating incentives that encourage partners to
###3817 implement new payment methods.
###3820 The Catholic Relief Services in Haiti when
###3822 they instituted paying their salaries through
###3825 mobile money, reduced their administrative costs
###3829 by 60 percent.
###3830 So we think that 20 percent is a,
###3834 is a huge goal.
###3835 But you know, we have an awesome set of other teams
###3839 here and we have got to beat them on some metrics.
###3841 And Shawn released his data today, so we can't
###3845 actually do that.
###3846 So we think that 20 percent is, is a great goal.
###3851 But we also as aspire to do higher.
###3855 We are prouder still that the White House wants to
###3857 expand this initiative across the US government.
###3860 Like the Department Of Defense.
###3861 Which has said it needs to get cash off of the battle
###3864 field to keep our soldiers safe.
###3868 In Afghanistan where police officers began to
###3871 get paid through mobile money instead of a series
###3873 of cash payments, they discovered that they had a
###3876 30 percent raise.
###3878 They thought they got that actually from the
###3880 mobile money company.
###3882 But in fact that was actually the amount of
###3884 sticky fingers that were happening from the time
###3886 the cash was deployed to the time they got it
###3889 in their hands.
###3890 A really important thing about this is, when they
###3894 were getting 30 percent less, they were getting
###3896 paid less than the Taliban was willing to offer them
###3900 to come to the other side.
###3902 When they got that 30 percent raise, the money
###3905 that they should have had in the first place, they
###3907 were getting paid more than the Taliban was
###3909 willing to offer them.
###3910 So if we don't think this has huge implications not
###3913 just for disaster but for national security as well
###3916 as Americans to sell products over seas, the
###3919 effect of this kind of payments platform, and the
###3923 efficiencies and opportunities are enormous.
###3928 So moving from cash to electronic helps us, helps
###3931 our security, it creates new products, and makes
###3933 the world more safe.
###3936 So we say to ourselves, well, this is so simple.
###3938 We thought this too.
###3939 We said okay, well, we'll just -- how many programs
###3943 could we possibly have doing cash at USAID globally?
###3946 We are in almost a hundred countries.
###3948 Well, we had a 140 projects that used cash
###3952 because it is hard to actually transport
###3954 anything else around the world.
###3956 So we got into this and we found this is actually
###3959 pretty darn complicated.
###3962 It sort of looks like navigating this slide.
###3966 It didn't take us long to realize that there were
###3968 deep challenges to internal processes,
###3971 contract language, audit requirements, internal
###3974 champions, and oh, yes, we wanted to make sure that
###3978 terrorists and money launderers around the
###3980 world couldn't actually use this new financial structure.
###3983 So we have been working very closely with our US
###3985 Treasury colleagues.
###3987 And other things I won't bore you with.
###3989 But it is a challenge that cuts across the banking
###3991 industry, the payments industry, technology,
###3994 consumer protection, and a whole lot of other
###3997 sets of bureaucracies.
###3999 So the White House and us went on a hunt to find an
###4003 entrepreneur with the experience and skill to
###4006 join Priya, to join [inaudible] and others to
###4008 tackle this multi-faceted challenge.
###4011 So I like to introduce Karl Mehta, our
###4013 Presidential innovation fellow.
###4015 [applause]
###4020 We are really excited to have him.
###4022 Karl is a Silicon Valley based entrepreneur from
###4024 Fremont, California.
###4026 He is an engineer,inventor.
###4028 He started three companies.
###4029 His last one, PlaySpan, he worked -- that he sold to
###4034 Visa, he worked with companies like Warner
###4036 Brothers, Nickelodeon, Disney and Facebook.
###4039 So you may have actually used if you brought,
###4042 bought some virtual goods on those sites, or you
###4044 bought some real goods you may have actually used the
###4046 payment platform of Karl.
###4048 So we are so excited to have you, Karl.
###4051 And we think his expertise is just going to be
###4054 essential to us accelerating the
###4055 development of these platforms world wide and
###4058 the efficiencies that we can gain in our
###4060 development program.
###4062 So a minute ago I mentioned that USAID is
###4064 proud of our work.
###4066 We are.
###4067 But actually if we are going to move from a cash
###4070 based world to electronic world,
###4072 we have to build a movement.
###4074 We have to build a movement across the US
###4075 Government hand in hand with the public sector and
###4078 the private sector to get out of cash.
###4080 And that is where you come involved.
###4083 If you work for a company that does business over
###4085 seas, if you worship at a place that does charitable
###4088 work over seas, if you know an NGO that works
###4091 globally, ask them to start using electronic payments.
###4094 Join us.
###4095 Build this mobile money and this electronics
###4098 payments platform and let us realize at
###4103 ProjectTwenty, the kinds of opportunities that I
###4106 have described today.
###4108 So join me in thanking Karl and come help us
###4111 revolutionize the world.
###4113 [applause]
###4119 So I would now like to introduce my good
###4121 friend and most amazing chief technology officer, for
###4126 the country, Todd Park.
###4127 [applause]
###4129 Todd Park: Thank you.
###4131 Hello. I just got the news flash that the hash tag innovate.gov
###4137 is trending across the United States of America.
###4139 So join the conversation, join the fun on Twitter.
###4142 So it is my great pleasure to talk with you about the
###4144 5th and final Presidential Innovation Fellows
###4147 Project, the Open Data Initiatives Program.
###4150 And I would like to start by talking about the weather.
###4152 Or more specifically weather data.
###4155 So decades ago, the government made a key
###4157 decision which was to actually make all of the
###4159 weather data it was collecting downloadable
###4162 electronically by anybody for free.
###4165 What then happened is that free fuel powered enormous
###4168 rising tide of innovation in the project.
###4170 Entrepreneurs, who picked up that data and turned it
###4172 into the Weather Channel, Weather.Com, iPhone
###4175 weather apps, weather insurance and much more.
###4177 Growing the economy, creating jobs, and adding
###4179 a lot of value to all of our lives.
###4181 Government ran a similar play in the 80's when
###4183 President Reagan began the process of liberating
###4186 access, civilly and commercial access to the
###4188 global positioning system. GPS.
###4191 Which, of course, now has spun everything from
###4193 navigation systems to precision crop farming to
###4196 four square on your iPhone and everything in between.
###4198 In fact, actually last year alone it is estimated
###4200 that civilian and commercial access to GPS
###4203 created $90 billion of value for the American economy.
###4207 Growing jobs, growing the economy, and improving all
###4209 of our lives in immeasurable ways.
###4211 And so we love this play.
###4213 We love this play of basically without
###4216 legislation, without regulation, without
###4218 actually really spending a ton of money, right,
###4220 taking data that is sitting in the vault of
###4222 the government that taxpayers have already
###4224 paid for, and Jiu Jitsuing it into the public domain
###4228 as machine readable fuel so the American
###4230 entrepreneur can take and turn into magic.
###4233 Turn into all kinds of new products, services that
###4236 help improve American lives, create jobs, and
###4238 grow the economy.
###4240 So that is what the Open Data Initiatives Program
###4242 is all about.
###4243 It is expanding and accelerating the work to
###4245 liberate data as fuel for American entrepreneurship
###4248 and innovation.
###4249 We are focused on these seven sectors.
###4252 Health is actually an area where through the Health
###4254 Data Initiative we have been liberating health
###4256 related data, information resources for a few years
###4259 now with hundreds of companies, large and
###4261 small, taking that data and turning it into all
###4263 kinds of products.
###4264 It will help you pick the right hospital or doctor
###4265 for your family.
###4266 Connect to a clinical trial that can save your life.
###4268 Help doctors deliver better care.
###4270 Help you manage your asthma, using the latest
###4272 medical knowledge and much more.
###4273 We just kicked off in May, a Safety Date Initiative.
###4276 We kicked off actually a couple of months ago
###4278 Energy Data Initiative.
###4279 An Education Data Initiative.
###4281 I see folks on that team here in the room for the
###4283 Department of Education.
###4284 We will shortly be launching an Impact Data
###4285 Initiative focused on non profit sector related data.
###4288 Global Development Data Initiative focused on food
###4290 security and other key topics.
###4292 And a Finance Data Initiative as well.
###4294 And the whole idea is not just to liberate data. Okay.
###4299 Because data by itself is useless. Right.
###4300 I can't feed my babies data.
###4303 I can't pour data on a wound and heal it, right?
###4305 I can't actually pour data on a road and fix it.
###4308 Data is only useful if it is applied.
###4310 So you do actually have to make new data available,
###4313 that is actually very helpful.
###4314 You also need to take existing public data, that
###4317 may be available, but in books, PDF's, static
###4320 websites that are useless to a developer, and
###4323 actually make it available in forms that are useful
###4325 to a developer. Right?
###4326 Bulk down loadable files, you know, liquid machine,
###4329 readable data, accessible through API's, basically
###4331 forms that are usable by developers.
###4332 You do that too.
###4333 But if you just do that, you have accomplished
###4336 actually some of what you need, but not all.
###4338 And the last thing you need to do is you need to
###4339 actually engage the people that you hope will use the
###4342 data, will apply the data to create tangible benefit
###4346 for the American people.
###4347 Engage with the entrepreneurs, innovators,
###4349 spread the word about the data that is available.
###4351 Get their feedback on what can be improved about,
###4353 what feedback actually would be useful to make a
###4356 new data resources available so on and so forth.
###4359 Celebrate what they are doing, spread the word
###4361 about what they are doing, and catalyze a chain
###4363 reaction of innovation that continually expands
###4366 the array of services, products, features
###4368 benefits, produced for the American people, produced
###4370 by entrepreneurs using our data, in a way that
###4373 actually improves lives and creates jobs.
###4376 And so what does success actually look like at the
###4378 end of the day?
###4379 Success looks like Dr. Pete Hudson, emergency
###4383 room doc and entrepreneur.
###4385 And Pete Hudson, in fact, happens to be here.
###4387 What do you know?
###4389 He is on the stage, Dr. Pete Hudson.
###4390 [applause]
###4396 Dr. Pete Hudson: Well, thank you,
###4397 Todd, and thank you very much for having me here at
###4400 this very exciting event here today.
###4402 Lots of energy in this room.
###4405 And Todd asked me to come here to talk to you about
###4408 the perspective as an entrepreneur from the
###4410 private sector who has worked with open data from
###4413 the government before.
###4415 And it has been a really important part of our
###4416 company and so I want to tell you our creation story.
###4419 So iTriage was created in 2009 by two crusty old ER
###4424 docs who are unlikely entrepreneurs.
###4427 The good looking one up here is Wayne Guerra on
###4429 the left and the other guy has a little bit more
###4431 gray hair now.
###4433 And we started the company after practicing emergency
###4437 medicine for about 20 years and taking care of
###4440 about 50,000 patients.
###4442 What we noticed during that period of time was
###4444 that people struggled with the core information
###4448 surrounding their health care.
###4450 That they didn't have the right information at the
###4452 right time to make the right decision and an
###4455 informed decision about what to do about
###4456 their health care.
###4457 And that led to huge problems.
###4459 Increased costs, bad outcomes, and huge
###4464 inefficiencies in the system.
###4466 And one day we just decided we had had enough,
###4468 we had to do something about it.
###4470 But we weren't really sure how to do it.
###4475 Enter the Smart Phone.
###4479 Todd Park: Should be.
###4483 Dr. Pete Hudson: So enter the Smart Phone a
###4485 device that you can take with you anywhere you need to be.
###4488 It can access data remotely.
###4490 It has a beautiful interface.
###4491 It is easy for people to use and you can distribute
###4493 technology wirelessly.
###4496 We called it our iTriage, because we wanted people
###4497 to be able to make decisions based on
###4499 information and based on the taxonomy of health care.
###4502 So we started to assemble data and we put together
###4506 clinical information, we connected that to provider
###4508 directories, and built a technology that allowed
###4512 people to start to work through the pathways of,
###4518 of clinical information starting with the symptom,
###4520 going to conditions, then all of the way to the
###4523 right providers, and then connecting directly
###4524 with that provider.
###4526 It was a very fun exercise in building a product and
###4529 so we launched it in the marketplace.
###4532 We didn't know what would happen.
###4534 And you know, one of the reasons I am here today is
###4537 because I think it became wildly successful.
###4539 Millions of people have downloaded it.
###4541 In fact, we are up to 7 million people right now.
###4545 Every month about it is used about 3 million times
###4549 to make health care decisions and to get the
###4551 information to make informed, take informed action.
###4555 It has been adopted by close to 20 percent of the
###4558 acute hospital marketplace, and we have
###4561 added on functionality to like appointment setting
###4563 and ER check in, urgent care check in, and things
###4566 like that to connect directly into the HIT
###4568 systems in the hospitals and provide that data
###4571 right back to the consumer.
###4574 It is -- it has been well reviewed by people all
###4577 around the country.
###4578 In fact, we have had 60,000 people write in
###4580 reviews and it is a four and a half out of five
###4582 stars on both markets.
###4585 We were so passionate about this and drove this,
###4588 this technology as quickly as we could.
###4592 In fact, from start up to the first significant
###4596 M Health Acquisition in the marketplace by Aetna, it
###4600 was about two and a half years.
###4601 And now we are part of this amazing group at
###4602 Aetna that is looking at post reform business
###4606 models for health care.
###4608 And how we fit into that.
###4609 So let's go back to the creation story and
###4610 back to 2010.
###4612 One of our employees Jonathan White, who is
###4615 starting to work with different sectors of
###4617 government came into me and said, have you heard
###4619 about this Open Data Initiative thing?
###4622 I said, no, I haven't heard about it.
###4624 But it sounds interesting.
###4625 So we got connected with Todd and others here in
###4629 the government, and we, we found out that there was
###4631 great data, provider data that we needed.
###4634 Federally qualified health centers provider, Medicare
###4638 provider data sets, mental health and substance abuse
###4641 data sets and they were actually put together and
###4643 opened up by great people in the government.
###4646 And made available to us.
###4649 We participated in two different events and presented.
###4652 And I am happy to announce that there has been
###4656 125,000 people that have found federally qualified
###4658 health centers since we started that.
###4661 About 25,000 people have found mental health and
###4664 substance abuse centers through our technology
###4666 with this data.
###4667 So we are actually really connecting people.
###4670 But I think the two things that I am proudest about
###4672 with this company are, one, that we went from two
###4675 employees who were unpaid, and I can vouch for that
###4679 because I was one of them.
###4681 To now 80 employees.
###4684 15 contractors.
###4685 30 open requisitions.
###4687 So for those of you who are motivated, like to
###4690 build stuff, and are really talented come join
###4693 the most amazing group of employees at our offices.
###4697 I know they are watching right now and they
###4698 are absolutely fantastic.
###4701 So that is one of the things that I am proudest of.
###4704 The second thing that I am proudest of is the number
###4706 of stories we have gotten of people who have been
###4709 empowered by this technology and made better
###4711 decisions from a man who had jaw pain, didn't know
###4716 what it could be, used our technology and connected
###4718 to, oh, it could be a heart attack.
###4720 I am going to call 911.
###4721 It saved his life.
###4723 To a story I just got the other day, a visually
###4726 impaired woman with cerebral palsy, who has
###4729 multiple medical problems, and is bed bound, who uses
###4732 our technology to become more informed about her
###4734 health conditions and medications.
###4736 And now can actually have communication with her
###4738 doctor about the different issues.
###4742 Those are the things that matter.
###4743 So that is our story.
###4744 It is a story of American innovation that is trying
###4747 to tackle a really big problem.
###4749 So download iTriage.
###4752 And it took us 20 years to take care of 50,000
###4754 patients and three to take care of 7 million.
###4757 That is how technology should scale and
###4760 make things better.
###4761 So thank you very much.
###4762 Todd Park: Thank you so much, Pete.
###4764 [applause]
###4764 Rock on.
###4768 And so what is the play?
###4770 What is the Open Data Initiatives Play exactly?
###4770 It is clone Pete Hudson.
###4775 That is the play.
###4776 Clone the story.
###4778 And very specifically clone the actual use
###4782 of the data.
###4783 The application of data by American entrepreneurship
###4786 innovators to create real benefit in people's lives.
###4789 Right.
###4790 Help people find the right doctor that could
###4792 save their life.
###4793 Help your daughter find the college that will
###4795 provide the best value for her.
###4797 Help a new father or mother know what products
###4801 have been recalled, what cribs have been recalled
###4804 so that you can actually keep your baby safe.
###4806 Get transparency on the non profit marketplace so
###4808 you actually put your charitable contributions,
###4810 your hard earned dollars into the non profits that
###4813 will produce the best value socially for your money.
###4818 Real tools, real services, built by American
###4820 entrepreneurs using free government data that can
###4823 help make American lives easier, make them better,
###4827 and create jobs and grow the economy all at
###4829 the same time.
###4831 And we are so incredibly excited by the fellows
###4834 that have come to town to help our amazing team do that.
###4837 And so I would like to introduce them starting
