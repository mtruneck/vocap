1
0:0:7,52 --> 0:0:12,99
Summer 1492.


2
0:0:12,99 --> 0:0:13,969
After three months at sea


3
0:0:13,969 --> 0:0:19,202
the Santa Maria, the Pinta and the NiÃ±a anchor off the Bahamas.


4
0:0:19,202 --> 0:0:29,73
Europe has found the Americas.


5
0:0:29,73 --> 0:0:45,21
Next comes conquest and colonization by settlers who remake America in their image.


6
0:0:45,21 --> 0:0:56,63
They advance and destroy.


7
0:0:56,63 --> 0:1:8,57
But there is another story about the animals and plants they bring here.


8
0:1:8,57 --> 0:1:16,74
And the natural treasures they find here.


9
0:1:16,74 --> 0:1:22,35
And how the Americas are completely transformed.


10
0:1:22,35 --> 0:1:56,79
It all began five hundred years ago.


11
0:1:56,79 --> 0:1:59,11
It's 1491.


12
0:1:59,11 --> 0:2:5,88
A year from now Christopher Columbus will set foot on this quiet beach.


13
0:2:5,88 --> 0:2:12,891
What's here before he arrives is a world of unbelievable natural wealth.


14
0:2:12,891 --> 0:2:19,899
Two vast continents teeming with life.


15
0:2:19,899 --> 0:2:26,739
More than six hundred thousand miles of coastline are surrounded by pristine waters.


16
0:2:26,739 --> 0:2:35,169
Shoals so dense they're said to slow the passage of ships.


17
0:2:35,169 --> 0:2:40,889
Countless species numbered in their tens of millions.


18
0:2:40,889 --> 0:2:43,2
Inland from the atlantic shores


19
0:2:43,2 --> 0:2:48,19
great forests stretch in every direction.


20
0:2:48,19 --> 0:3:0,459
This new world is a land of stark contrasts.


21
0:3:0,459 --> 0:3:3,59
From the lush jungles of South-America


22
0:3:3,59 --> 0:3:5,779
to the glaciers of the Arctic north.


23
0:3:5,779 --> 0:3:10,659
and the great plains of the midwest where gigantic herds


24
0:3:10,659 --> 0:3:13,389
thunder across North-America


25
0:3:13,389 --> 0:3:34,349
There is room for caribou, antilope, bison and the giant grizzly.


26
0:3:34,349 --> 0:3:37,719
 In the sky above flocks of birds nearly block out the sun.


27
0:3:37,719 --> 0:3:46,919
as millions of pigeons, ducks and geese cover the horizon.


28
0:3:46,919 --> 0:3:52,19
No one in Europe has dared imagine the magnificent bounty that exists


29
0:3:52,19 --> 0:4:5,119
on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean.


30
0:4:5,119 --> 0:4:6,939
In 1491


31
0:4:6,939 --> 0:4:11,939
Christopher Columbus stands on the coast of Spain, looking west.


32
0:4:11,939 --> 0:4:19,679
He dreams of leading an expedition to find a new trade route to Asia.


33
0:4:19,679 --> 0:4:35,19
Success will mean glory and riches for himself and the Spanish monarchy.


34
0:4:35,19 --> 0:4:39,11
In Europe the nobles have grown wealthy by trading with the east.


35
0:4:39,11 --> 0:4:42,57
Spices and gold, gemstones and silk,


36
0:4:42,57 --> 0:4:45,3
are the most lucrative goods.


37
0:4:45,3 --> 0:4:51,34
But Europeans have lost the silk road to the Turks and foreign trade is in decline.


38
0:4:51,34 --> 0:4:55,529
The wealth of kings is in danger.


39
0:4:55,529 --> 0:4:57,56
Isabella, queen of Spain,


40
0:4:57,56 --> 0:5:1,619
is desperate to find new routes to India.


41
0:5:1,619 --> 0:5:6,629
And she has a plan.


42
0:5:6,629 --> 0:5:9,63
Isabella is the most powerful woman in Europe,


43
0:5:9,63 --> 0:5:15,65
a continent of expanding horizons filled with competitive and inventive souls.


44
0:5:15,65 --> 0:5:22,259
For five hundred years they have been building castles, palaces and centres of trade.


45
0:5:22,259 --> 0:5:31,99
Kings and popes have raised armies to fight each other and their enemies on Europe's borders.


46
0:5:31,99 --> 0:5:34,16
Nowhere else are rivalries so intense.


47
0:5:34,16 --> 0:5:36,35
Gold fever is so widespread,


48
0:5:36,35 --> 0:5:38,88
religious fervour and business expertise


49
0:5:38,88 --> 0:5:44,439
as tightly wound as in Europe in 1491.


50
0:5:44,439 --> 0:5:46,249
Ideas are moving forward,


51
0:5:46,249 --> 0:5:48,85
curiosity and the thirst for power


52
0:5:48,85 --> 0:6:1,9
pushes Europe's limits.


53
0:6:1,9 --> 0:6:3,9
Europe is a busy and crowded continent,


54
0:6:3,9 --> 0:6:6,59
trying to feed a growing population


55
0:6:6,59 --> 0:6:9,2
of one hundred million people.


56
0:6:9,2 --> 0:6:16,979
Natural resources are already exploited as land becomes scarce and overworked.


57
0:6:16,979 --> 0:6:23,8
Most of the peasants are farmers working land that belongs to someone else,


58
0:6:23,8 --> 0:6:28,99
owned by the nobles or the Church.


59
0:6:28,99 --> 0:6:31,52
Their main diet is bread and porridge,


60
0:6:31,52 --> 0:6:35,749
both made from harvesting grains.


61
0:6:35,749 --> 0:6:39,38
They plant rye or wheat in winter,


62
0:6:39,38 --> 0:6:43,62
oats or barley in the spring.


63
0:6:43,62 --> 0:6:53,289
And every third year the field lies fallow to regenerate.


64
0:6:53,289 --> 0:6:59,53
They've learned to harness water and wind for power.


65
0:6:59,53 --> 0:7:0,81
It is hard work


66
0:7:0,81 --> 0:7:11,479
but good for producing higher yields in smaller spaces.


67
0:7:11,479 --> 0:7:22,849
This agricultural revolution allows the European population to grow.


68
0:7:22,849 --> 0:7:29,129
With the help of one more important element:


69
0:7:29,129 --> 0:7:38,939
domesticated animals.


70
0:7:38,939 --> 0:7:41,629
Horses  pull ploughs,


71
0:7:41,629 --> 0:7:47,49
cattle provide meat, fur and hides.


72
0:7:47,49 --> 0:7:57,259
The pig is a main source of meat and leather.


73
0:7:57,259 --> 0:8:7,11
And so too are sheep.


74
0:8:7,11 --> 0:8:13,229
And the mules can pull a cart.


75
0:8:13,229 --> 0:8:30,679
Cows also give them milk, butter and cheese.


76
0:8:30,679 --> 0:8:35,78
It is not only people that domesticate animals.


77
0:8:35,78 --> 0:8:46,86
The big five: horses, cattle, goats, pigs and sheep domesticate the European landscape.


78
0:8:46,86 --> 0:8:52,97
They contribute to Europe's overcrowded conditions.


79
0:8:52,97 --> 0:8:58,68
In 1491 the Americas too are a crowded and prosperous place.


80
0:8:58,68 --> 0:9:4,46
But in a very different way.


81
0:9:4,46 --> 0:9:12,66
The Andes cradled a vast empire ruled by powerful god kings.


82
0:9:12,66 --> 0:9:21,86
Messoamerica is densely populated and home to the most impressive civilizations on the continent.


83
0:9:21,86 --> 0:9:28,6
The atlantic coast is filled with smaller villages and fields.


84
0:9:28,6 --> 0:9:35,5
And along the great rivers great cities are built around monumental plazas.


85
0:9:35,5 --> 0:9:37,49
It is an ancient world


86
0:9:37,49 --> 0:9:42,4
inhabited by one hundred million people,


87
0:9:42,4 --> 0:9:44,71
hunters and gatherers,


88
0:9:44,71 --> 0:9:46,77
fishermen and farmers,


89
0:9:46,77 --> 0:9:53,67
kings, slaves and soldiers.


90
0:9:53,67 --> 0:9:55,53
Down among the trees,


91
0:9:55,53 --> 0:9:59,42
where the Missouri, Illinois and Mississippi rivers merge,


92
0:9:59,42 --> 0:10:5,55
lies one of the largest civilizations on the continent.


93
0:10:5,55 --> 0:10:9,9
The native Mississippians are mound builders occupying a vast region


94
0:10:9,9 --> 0:10:12,7
from the great lakes in the north


95
0:10:12,7 --> 0:10:17,47
to Florida in the south.


96
0:10:17,47 --> 0:10:23,88
The first explorers thought these great mounds were natural, carved by retreating glaciers.


97
0:10:23,88 --> 0:10:28,75
Now we know that they are the centerpieces of cities.


98
0:10:28,75 --> 0:10:36,83
Cities like Cahokia, busy trading posts of earth and wood,


99
0:10:36,83 --> 0:10:44,25
with populations of up to thousands of people.


100
0:10:44,25 --> 0:10:52,23
No one knows what they called themselves or what language they spoke.


101
0:10:52,23 --> 0:10:58,83
But we know why were they successful.


102
0:10:58,83 --> 0:11:2,24
These Mississippians are farmers.


103
0:11:2,24 --> 0:11:4,16
Their staple crop is fuel


104
0:11:4,16 --> 0:11:6,7
for the ever growing population.


105
0:11:6,7 --> 0:11:18,11
It is a plant native to the Americas unknown to the rest of the world.


106
0:11:18,11 --> 0:11:23,12
But corn is not a blessing from nature or a gift of the gods.


107
0:11:23,12 --> 0:11:33,87
This crop is the outcome of man's first feat of genetic engineering.


108
0:11:33,87 --> 0:11:38,23
Once they learned how to grow it, they could stay in one place.


109
0:11:38,23 --> 0:11:40,1
This simple diet


110
0:11:40,1 --> 0:11:49,34
translated straight into the energy to build a civilization.


111
0:11:49,34 --> 0:11:51,19
The cultivation of corn


112
0:11:51,19 --> 0:11:57,35
is the key to flourishing cultures in the Americas before Columbus.


113
0:11:57,35 --> 0:12:0,83
The staple crop in North-America was corn.


114
0:12:0,83 --> 0:12:4,73
Six thousand years ago ears of corn were only about as long as a person's thumb.


115
0:12:4,73 --> 0:12:8,44
and they were barely edible. It took thousands of years to develop a more


116
0:12:8,44 --> 0:12:13,36
nourishing and larger hybrid and also a hybrid that can grow in cooler climates,


117
0:12:13,36 --> 0:12:15,1
outside Messoamerica.


118
0:12:15,1 --> 0:12:21,8
It wasn't until about eleven hundred years ago that corn reached the Mississippi river valley.


119
0:12:21,8 --> 0:12:29,33
Corn is the result of the domestication of the wild teosinte grass.


120
0:12:29,33 --> 0:12:34,33
Early Americans started with this spindly stock.


121
0:12:34,33 --> 0:12:42,65
And over the centuries they developed it into today's giant corn.


122
0:12:42,65 --> 0:12:48,19
Archaeologists and biologists are still debating how corn was achieved


123
0:12:48,19 --> 0:12:51,17
out of a tiny grass.


124
0:12:51,17 --> 0:12:55,66
Corn is one of the keys to understanding American civilization.


125
0:12:55,66 --> 0:12:57,21
Wherever it flourishes


126
0:12:57,21 --> 0:12:59,79
so do great cultures.


127
0:12:59,79 --> 0:13:5,3
Yet the greatest American empire of them all is found where corn cannot grow.


128
0:13:5,3 --> 0:13:14,47
High in the Andes.


129
0:13:14,47 --> 0:13:20,79
The Inca empire stretches nearly two thousand five hundred miles down the west coast of South-America.


130
0:13:20,79 --> 0:15:20,79
Inca built palaces, storehouses and castles in the tall mountains.
