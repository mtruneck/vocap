###1 CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: Fridays may be awesome, but we are asking about a different day of
###4 the week in today`s "Shoutout." A lot of ground to cover before we get there, though, so let`s
###8 go ahead and get started.
###24 An alleged plot to blow up the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, that`s where we start today.
###29 Federal authorities say, they`ve broken it up and arrested the suspect as part of an
###33 undercover investigation. The Federal Reserve is the central bank of the United States.
###39 This one in New York is a regional branch of it. Officials say the suspect was planning
###43 to set off an explosion there with what he thought was a 1000 pound bomb. No, it wasn`t
###49 real. The false explosives came from an undercover agent. Quazi Nafis is 21 years old. He`s from
###55 Bangladesh, came to the U.S. on a student visa. But prosecutors say, his real goal was
###60 to carry out a terrorist attack. He was arrested after he tried to set off the device.
###64 There are a lot of ways to pay for college. Scholarships, financial aid, savings, working
###70 through it. Another option is student loans. Now, those have to be repaid, and a new report
###76 says today`s college seniors are graduating with more student loan debt, more money that
###81 has to be repaid than ever before.
###84 This report says, the two thirds of the class of 2011 had student loan debt, and the average
###89 borrower owed nearly $27,000. Part of this depends on what school you go to. At the colleges
###95 this study looked at, the low into the average debt per graduate was 3,000, the high end,
###101 more than 55,000. A couple of explanations were offered for the debt increase from previous
###106 years. One is rising tuition prices, the other is the tough job market for college graduates
###112 looking for work.
###113 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
###116 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What`s the word? The amount by which spending exceeds income.
###121 Deficit. That`s the word.
###127 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###132 AZUZ: Right now, the U.S. government is running a deficit, it has been for years, it`s the
###137 topic that comes up a lot in politics, and as you might expect, it`s come up a lot in
###141 this year`s presidential campaign. In fact, during this week`s debate, between Barack
###146 Obama and Mitt Romney, the word deficit came up nearly 20 times. Both candidates have plans
###152 for how to do with it, Tom Foreman compares their ideas.
###155 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###155 TOM FOREMAN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Both candidates have made it a cornerstone of this election
###158 to talk about the deficit, the difference between how much money our government is spending
###163 and how much it is taking in in taxes. This is the deficit right now, $1,090,000,000,00.
###170 If we all wanted to pay it off, every man, woman and child in the country would have
###173 to kick in about $3500. That`s a lot, and yet each candidate says confidently, I can
###180 reduce the deficit. How would they do that? Well, first, let`s talk about what they agree
###185 on.
###185 They all say that we`re going to have to contain the spending of the government and control
###189 it, but we`re also going to have to rewrite the tax code, and we have to get the economy
###193 moving again, because that`s what going to produce money and revenue, and really solve
###197 the problem, but beyond that, they don`t agree on much.
###200 Let`s look at the Romney plan first. If these were to represent everything he wants to spend
###205 money on, and he needs this much to cover it, he knows he`s not going to get it, because
###209 he has a deficit. So, how is he going to deal with that deficit? He says he is going to
###214 do it with tax cuts. Now, tax cuts initially are going to make the deficit worse, so he
###220 needs to offset them. He says he is going to do that by looking at deductions and loopholes,
###225 things that people use to avoid paying taxes. Says, he won`t go after things like the mortgage
###230 deduction, or the health care deduction, things that many middle class people rely on, at
###234 least he suggests he won`t go after those, but that`s the problem. Economists say, if
###238 you grab up all the other deductions that you might put on wealthier people and you
###242 put them all back in this pile, it`s not going to be enough, you are going to end up eventually
###248 having to tax the middle class or watching the deficit just get bigger, at least based
###253 on the plan as I know it right now.
###255 Barack Obama, he has different version of the same song. He`s got all the things he
###259 wants to pay for, he also will not have all the money he needs for it. He is going to
###263 have a deficit, too, and he says you can deal with it by taxing the wealthy. This is a popular
###269 plan with many voters, but it also has a fundamental flaw. There are just not that many wealthy
###274 people in the country. If you define wealthy as being people who individually make more
###279 than $200,000 a year, as he often does, for every one there is like that in the country,
###284 this is how many there are who don`t make that much money. You would have to tax these
###289 person at a much higher rate than the White House is talking about to solve this problem,
###293 and even then you probably wouldn`t get enough money to really make up the deficit. The simple
###299 truth is, both of these plans are woefully short on important details to tell us if they
###306 would really reduce the deficit.
###308 (END VIDEOTAPE)
###308 PELLEY: All right, discussing politics with your friends, that can be kind of tricky,
###313 especially if you don`t agree on every issue. It could lead to some arguments, it could
###317 lead to some hurt feelings, but doing it online? That could lead to some downright unfriendingness.
###324 Karin Caifa takes a look at how this year`s presidential election is effecting some people`s
###328 friends and followers on social media.
###330 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###331 KARIN CAIFA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: While the candidates have squared off here and here
###335 and here, another intense debate has played out here.
###339 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: When you get a chance to watch debates, you can kind of just go
###342 on Facebook and figure out exactly what happened.
###344 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: If we go back and forth, I don`t know, I mean there are statuses in
###348 mind, we do, we do that a lot.
###349 CAIFA: Social media traffic during the major political events has exploded during the 2012
###354 campaign season, and soak in emotions as Facebook and Twitter feeds get jammed with more political
###359 statements than ever.
###361 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: There are some times entertaining, I just usually ignore them most
###366 of the time.
###367 CAIFA: Some time it`s too much to ignore. A survey from the Pew Research Center earlier
###372 this year found roughly one in five social media users has cut someone off for a political
###377 post that went too far.
###378 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: He got personal, I said, no, no. You are out! You are out!
###382 CAIFA: But for every post that makes you want to hit delete, think about this, Kelly Fincham,
###388 assistant professor at Hofstra University, says that not having any debate among connections
###393 may not be good either.
###395 KELLY FINCHAM, HOFSTRA UNIVERSITY: It does act a little bit like an echo chain. You are
###404 usually following people who they are already your friends. It`s harder to hear other opinions.
###406 So it`s harder to seek out alternative opinions and voices.
###408 CAIFA: Users can always hide updates from friends or followers during big political
###412 events, or until the electoral overload stops after November 6th. In Hempstead, New York,
###419 I`m Karin Caifa.
###419 (END VIDEOTAPE)
###420 AZUZ: So, this brings up an interesting question, would you un-friend someone for making political
###425 statements you didn`t agree with? Would you just hide their posts or would you just ignore
###429 it. We are asking on our blog today, if you head to CNN STUDENT NEWS.COM you can tell
###433 us what you think, but only if you use your first name, no last initials, no classes.
###440 If you`ve never been in a plane and flown over a landmark, the captain might get on
###443 the speaker and draw your attention to it. It`s kind of what happened on an Air Canada
###447 flight this week. The plane was almost at the end of a 14-hour flight to Australia when
###452 the captain dropped down from 37,000 feet to 4,000 feet. Then he asked people to peek
###458 out the window and see if they could find something. This yacht, it was stranded out
###463 on the water, no fuel, broken mast, the sailor set off an emergency signal. Officials asked
###468 the Air Canada flight if it could help out, and the people onboard did. Passengers and
###473 crew spotted him, authorities eventually arrived to pick up the sailor. Total time from when
###479 he set off the signal to when he was spotted by the plane, 25 minutes.
###483 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###484 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today`s "Shoutout" goes out to Mrs. Rader`s social studies classes
###490 at Warren Hills Regional Middle School in Washington, New Jersey.
###493 The U.S. presidential election is traditionally held on what day of the week? Here we go,
###499 is it Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday or Saturday. You`ve got three seconds, go!
###508 The presidential election is held on the Tuesday following the first Monday in November. That`s
###517 your answer and that`s your "Shoutout."
###520 (END VIDEOTAPE)
###521 AZUZ: Tuesday is also when new video games are traditionally released. The new "Halo"
###526 comes out on Tuesday, November 6. That date, the day of U.S. presidential election.
###531 This was the kind of line that formed when "Halo 3" came out in 2007, people going to
###536 stores for midnight release parties. Some folks are wondering if this year`s release
###540 could impact the election. One point of view says people who are motivated to vote, are
###544 going to vote. Another says, people might skip voting to dive into the new game. What
###549 do you say? If you are already on Facebook, talk to us at Facebook.com/cnnstudentnews.
###553 And finally, that old cliche about being sent to bed without your dinner? I think this is
###560 the exact opposite. These twins are so totally tuckered out, they are slipping in their sleep,
###565 as they slurp up spaghetti. The one on the left gave in pretty quickly, the one on the
###570 right keeps chewing, even as he nods off. Youtube video is great, and it`s understandable:
###575 you`ve got kids who are obviously ready for bed. Even with the temptation of delicious
###580 spaghetti, you can`t expect them to stay awake pasta certain point. All right. How do we
###585 come up with brilliant puns like that one? You just got to use your noodle. That eats
###588 up our time for the day. Have a great weekend, and we`ll see you on Monday.
