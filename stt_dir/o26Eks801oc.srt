THOMAS MORTON: Hi,
it's Thomas.


3
0:0:26,26 --> 0:0:29,38
We're in Ghana, the internet
capital of Africa.


4
0:0:29,38 --> 0:0:31,24
If you ever wonder what happens
to computers that you


5
0:0:31,24 --> 0:0:35,7
donate to one of those green
e-recycling programs, this is


6
0:0:35,7 --> 0:0:37,465
basically it.


7
0:0:37,465 --> 0:0:39,89
Kids from the north of Ghana
come to this junkyard during


8
0:0:39,89 --> 0:0:43,12
the summer to break computers
down for scrap and also inhale


9
0:0:43,12 --> 0:0:45,96
things that will probably end
up giving them cancer of the


10
0:0:45,96 --> 0:0:47,21
everything.


11
0:0:47,21 --> 0:0:48,928



12
0:0:48,928 --> 0:0:57,97



13
0:0:57,97 --> 0:0:59,555
THOMAS MORTON: Most of the
computers are only worth the


14
0:0:59,555 --> 0:1:1,566
dollar or two of copper you
can melt out of them.


15
0:1:1,566 --> 0:1:4,12
But occasionally you harvest
something useful, like a hard


16
0:1:4,12 --> 0:1:6,49
drive or a processor, which
you can sell at the little


17
0:1:6,49 --> 0:1:11,936
flea market area next to
the charnel grounds.


18
0:1:11,936 --> 0:1:12,73
THOMAS MORTON: Ah, OK.


19
0:1:12,73 --> 0:1:15,58
If you're an especially savvy
shopper, you can actually put


20
0:1:15,58 --> 0:1:18,33
together a full working computer
here, one ready to


21
0:1:18,33 --> 0:1:20,63
connect you to the fastest
internet in all of Africa.

23

THOMAS MORTON: Ghana puts a
lot of stock in computers.


24
0:1:29,31 --> 0:1:31,79
Their internet is directly
linked to Great Britain's, and


25
0:1:31,79 --> 0:1:33,76
they are billboards all over
the capital, extolling the


26
0:1:33,76 --> 0:1:35,4
virtues of personal computing.


27
0:1:35,4 --> 0:1:39,9
Ghana already is sort of the top
dog of West Africa, where


28
0:1:39,9 --> 0:1:41,27
most of its neighbors have
been plagued by war and


29
0:1:41,27 --> 0:1:44,12
poverty since independence,
Ghana's had almost 50 years of


30
0:1:44,12 --> 0:1:45,76
stability and growth.


31
0:1:45,76 --> 0:1:46,97
Right now they're hoping
foreign investment will


32
0:1:46,97 --> 0:1:49,92
bolster a computer industry
here, which will permanently


33
0:1:49,92 --> 0:1:52,46
make them the tech capital
of West Africa.


34
0:1:52,46 --> 0:1:54,81
So far it hasn't quite
materialized, but what has


35
0:1:54,81 --> 0:1:57,57
materialized is a thriving
underground economy of fraud


36
0:1:57,57 --> 0:2:1,24
and witchcraft called Sakawa.

[MUSIC PLAYING]


41
0:3:18,98 --> 0:3:20,92
THOMAS MORTON: Sakawa dates back
to Nigeria's oil boom in


42
0:3:20,92 --> 0:3:22,62
the late '70s.


43
0:3:22,62 --> 0:3:24,48
Ghanaians came into the country
to take jobs in the


44
0:3:24,48 --> 0:3:26,43
oil fields, and the locals
taught them their favorite


45
0:3:26,43 --> 0:3:29,0
pastime, the pen-pal scam.


46
0:3:29,0 --> 0:3:30,93
The way it works is you write
to someone in America or


47
0:3:30,93 --> 0:3:33,36
England, tell them about an
investment opportunity you


48
0:3:33,36 --> 0:3:36,23
have, or just straight up ask
them for money, and they send


49
0:3:36,23 --> 0:3:38,75
it to you, and that's
it-- scam over.


50
0:3:38,75 --> 0:3:40,64
Eventually the Nigerian
government deported all the


51
0:3:40,64 --> 0:3:42,56
Ghanaian guest workers back
home, and they brought the


52
0:3:42,56 --> 0:3:43,97
pen-pal scam with them.


53
0:3:43,97 --> 0:3:47,14
Then they combined
it with magic.


54
0:3:47,14 --> 0:4:15,6



55
0:4:15,6 --> 0:4:16,55
THOMAS MORTON: As the internet
took hold in Ghana, the


56
0:4:16,55 --> 0:4:18,25
pen-pal scam was adapted
to email.


57
0:4:18,25 --> 0:4:20,68
Then scammers started hooking
up with hackers online and


58
0:4:20,68 --> 0:4:22,85
incorporating things like credit
card fraud into their


59
0:4:22,85 --> 0:4:23,74
scams, which became


60
0:4:23,74 --> 0:4:26,86
increasingly complex and lucrative.


61
0:4:26,86 --> 0:4:29,14
We kind of like the idea of
making a living off the back


62
0:4:29,14 --> 0:4:32,59
American stupidity, so we hooked
up with a Sakawa gang,


63
0:4:32,59 --> 0:4:35,43
led by a young Ghanaian
named Sefa.


64
0:4:35,43 --> 0:4:48,265



65
0:4:48,265 --> 0:4:50,69
THOMAS MORTON: And now the
term just gets used--


66
0:4:50,69 --> 0:4:51,94
THOMAS MORTON: --for
everything.


67
0:4:51,94 --> 0:5:10,67



68
0:5:10,67 --> 0:5:13,15
THOMAS MORTON: Sefa's a
Sakawa success story.


69
0:5:13,15 --> 0:5:15,19
He's used his old scam earnings
to pay for business


70
0:5:15,19 --> 0:5:17,47
school and has made a nice
living for himself by Ghanaian


71
0:5:17,47 --> 0:5:21,76
standards, although he still has
to cross a stream of urine


72
0:5:21,76 --> 0:5:24,62
every night to get
into his house.


73
0:5:24,62 --> 0:5:28,11
Sakawa comprises any number of
online scams, but the majority


74
0:5:28,11 --> 0:5:30,9
boil down to two basic types.


75
0:5:30,9 --> 0:5:32,46
One, you pretend you're a sexy
girl, convince someone to fall


76
0:5:32,46 --> 0:5:33,85
in love with you, and then
they send you money.


77
0:5:33,85 --> 0:5:36,29
This is called the
romance scam.


78
0:5:36,29 --> 0:5:38,43
The other one is, you use a
stolen or forged credit card


79
0:5:38,43 --> 0:5:39,87
number to buy something
online.


80
0:5:39,87 --> 0:5:41,55
Then you have it shipped to
someone in the West who sends


81
0:5:41,55 --> 0:5:42,8
you money for it.


82
0:5:42,8 --> 0:5:45,68
That one's called the
shopping scam.


83
0:5:45,68 --> 0:5:47,89
These two scams sort of
work like templates.


84
0:5:47,89 --> 0:5:50,15
Once you nail down the basics
of them, you can start


85
0:5:50,15 --> 0:5:52,67
combining them and adding all
sorts of personalized details


86
0:5:52,67 --> 0:5:54,88
until your mark feels like he's
in the middle of some


87
0:5:54,88 --> 0:5:57,57
elaborate international business
scheme and not just


88
0:5:57,57 --> 0:6:1,16
emailing back and forth with
an African kid on a laptop.


89
0:6:1,16 --> 0:6:3,625
The thing with Sakawa is while
it's essentially free money,


90
0:6:3,625 --> 0:6:5,545
it isn't easy money.


91
0:6:5,545 --> 0:6:7,38
To find someone gullible
enough to fall for your


92
0:6:7,38 --> 0:6:9,71
shtick, you have to spend
hours and hours emailing


93
0:6:9,71 --> 0:6:12,77
hundreds and thousands
of random addresses.


94

95

THOMAS MORTON: In America,
frustrated gamblers will kiss


96
0:6:53,6 --> 0:6:57,1
a lucky penny or pray to Saint
Bernardino for help.


97
0:6:57,1 --> 0:6:59,42
Likewise, frustrated Sakawa
boys turn to religion when


98
0:6:59,42 --> 0:7:1,26
they're down on their luck.


99
0:7:1,26 --> 0:7:4,0
Only in their case, turning to
religion means driving out


100
0:7:4,0 --> 0:7:6,5
into the bush and paying
a juju priest


101
0:7:6,5 --> 0:7:9,558
for magic email powers.

in Africa right now.


104
0:7:30,18 --> 0:7:33,89



105
0:7:33,89 --> 0:7:36,88
Juju is the local term for what
fancy anthropology types


106
0:7:36,88 --> 0:7:39,15
call traditional African
religion.


107
0:7:39,15 --> 0:7:42,14
In the same way that Hinduism
is actually more or less a


108
0:7:42,14 --> 0:7:45,6
collection of thousands of local
deities and rituals,


109
0:7:45,6 --> 0:7:47,89
juju is basically an umbrella
for any West African religious


110
0:7:47,89 --> 0:7:51,35
practice that isn't obviously
Christianity or Islam--


111
0:7:51,35 --> 0:7:53,14
or Scientology.


112
0:7:53,14 --> 0:7:55,76
One aspect central to all forms
of juju is that the


113
0:7:55,76 --> 0:7:58,27
spirit world is morally
neutral.


114
0:7:58,27 --> 0:8:0,41
As in the gods don't give a shit
what you and I do to each


115
0:8:0,41 --> 0:8:3,42
other as long as
they get paid.


116
0:8:3,42 --> 0:8:5,67
This makes juju perfect
for Sakawa.


117
0:8:5,67 --> 0:8:7,93
If you want a leg up on the
competition, you get a juju


118
0:8:7,93 --> 0:8:9,73
priest to barter with the
spirits, and then they give


119
0:8:9,73 --> 0:8:12,2
you powers.


120
0:8:12,2 --> 0:8:14,45
So the point of the juju
ceremony we're dancing in


121
0:8:14,45 --> 0:8:16,5
isn't to win converts or
teach some sort of a


122
0:8:16,5 --> 0:8:18,3
lesson like in church.


123
0:8:18,3 --> 0:8:20,3
It's to demonstrate the priests
ins with the spirit


124
0:8:20,3 --> 0:8:22,55
world and advertise
his powers.


125
0:8:22,55 --> 0:8:26,53
Powers like channeling a god
who can't be cut by knifes.


126
0:8:26,53 --> 0:8:28,89
Or channeling another god,
who likes throwing eggs.


127
0:8:28,89 --> 0:8:35,33



128
0:8:35,33 --> 0:8:39,49

129
0:8:39,49 --> 0:8:42,85
THOMAS MORTON: Why, why
does he throw them?


130

THOMAS MORTON: Oh.


131

132
0:8:51,18 --> 0:8:54,38
Waste of powers.


133
0:8:54,38 --> 0:8:56,38
The flip side to all this is
once you make a deal with the


134
0:8:56,38 --> 0:8:58,75
gods, you're bound
to their terms.


135
0:8:58,75 --> 0:9:0,84
If you piss them off or default
on payment to your


136
0:9:0,84 --> 0:9:3,94
juju priest, you end up with the
opposite of powers, like


137
0:9:3,94 --> 0:9:7,42
bad luck or AIDS.

originally referred to a very

specific type of internet fraud
mixed with juju, then it


157
0:10:49,73 --> 0:10:52,33
went on to mean any internet
crime involving witchcraft,

into its own full-blown

Ghallywood, operates on kind


181

of a "more is more" principle
of movie making.


182

THOMAS MORTON: Since being
thrust into the mainstream,


208
0:15:43,23 --> 0:15:45,76
though, Sakawa has drawn a huge
outcry from government


209
0:15:45,76 --> 0:15:49,29
officials, tabloids, and
Christian preachers, whose


210
0:15:49,29 --> 0:15:51,16
billboards in Accra are almost
as ubiquitous as ads for


211
0:15:51,16 --> 0:15:53,165
computer classes and
juju priests.


212
0:15:53,165 --> 0:15:56,35



213
0:15:56,35 --> 0:16:29,3



214
0:16:29,3 --> 0:16:31,13
THOMAS MORTON: While the furor
over Sakawa dominates the


215
0:16:31,13 --> 0:16:34,13
tabloids and pulpits, the focus
is all on black magic


216
0:16:34,13 --> 0:16:36,33
and blood debts and Sakawa boys
turning each other into


217
0:16:36,33 --> 0:16:38,27
goats and snakes.


218
0:16:38,27 --> 0:16:40,44
None of it tackles the root of
the problem, the fact that


219
0:16:40,44 --> 0:16:42,48
over a third of young Ghanaians
are unemployed, and


220
0:16:42,48 --> 0:16:44,3
what jobs there are are filled
by corrupt government


221
0:16:44,3 --> 0:16:45,85
officials and their cousins.


222
0:16:45,85 --> 0:16:59,2



223
0:16:59,2 --> 0:17:15,589



224
0:17:15,589 --> 0:17:17,13
THOMAS MORTON: Up until now
the government's been more


225
0:17:17,13 --> 0:17:20,2
than happy to turn a blind eye
to Sakawa since it's basically


226
0:17:20,2 --> 0:17:23,44
providing regular work for
people that they can't.


227
0:17:23,44 --> 0:17:25,359
There are also persistent rumors
that Sakawa isn't just


228
0:17:25,359 --> 0:17:28,3
limited to gangs of teenage
delinquents, but is actually a


229
0:17:28,3 --> 0:17:30,57
popular sideline among
policemen, soldiers and


230
0:17:30,57 --> 0:17:32,43
politicians.


231
0:17:32,43 --> 0:17:50,18



232
0:17:50,18 --> 0:17:51,81
THOMAS MORTON: Now that's
Sakawa's threatening Ghana's


233
0:17:51,81 --> 0:17:54,35
business reputation, the
government's cracking down.


234
0:17:54,35 --> 0:17:57,32
And them and the press have
started a moral panic over it.


235
0:17:57,32 --> 0:17:59,82
Just like gangsta rappers in
the early '90s, Sakawa boys


236
0:17:59,82 --> 0:18:3,8
have gone from objects of sort
of cultural fascination to


237
0:18:3,8 --> 0:18:5,41
scapegoats for all their
country's ills.

242
0:19:42,63 --> 0:19:44,3
THOMAS MORTON: The end of Sakawa
may not necessarily


243
0:19:44,3 --> 0:19:46,68
bring juju Armageddon to Ghana,
but it will leave a


244
0:19:46,68 --> 0:19:48,98
bunch of angry young men without
any source of steady


245
0:19:48,98 --> 0:19:54,13
income, which is arguably
even scarier.


246
0:19:54,13 --> 0:19:57,7
On a lighter note, Ghana just
discovered oil off its shore,


247
0:19:57,7 --> 0:19:59,87
so maybe that'll solve
all their problems.
