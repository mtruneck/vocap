1
0:0:0,4 --> 0:0:2,0
It's over.


2
0:0:2,0 --> 0:0:6,4
I... I can't believe it.


3
0:0:6,4 --> 0:0:8,84
Listen, Richard, we had a great time.


4
0:0:8,84 --> 0:0:11,64
Maybe I even loved you but times change.


5
0:0:11,64 --> 0:0:14,72
<i>I've got to think about me, about my life.</i>


6
0:0:14,72 --> 0:0:17,8
The Guardian want me to write
this pop column.


7
0:0:17,8 --> 0:0:22,4
I'm going to Fuji to interview the Fugees,
Maui for Bowie, Malaga for the Gallaghers.


8
0:0:22,4 --> 0:0:24,56
I'm going to be meeting new people.


9
0:0:24,56 --> 0:0:27,0
'I just don't think I'll have time for you.'


10
0:0:27,0 --> 0:0:29,96
I'm sorry but I think this is best for both of us.


11
0:0:29,96 --> 0:0:32,12
'In the long run you'll thank me.'


12
0:0:32,12 --> 0:0:37,52
'I'm meeting loads of new people and that
doesn't leave any room in my life for you.'


13
0:0:37,52 --> 0:0:39,24
'It's over, Daisy.'


14
0:0:39,24 --> 0:0:43,36
It's over... I can't...


15
0:0:43,36 --> 0:1:10,76
I can't believe it.


16
0:1:10,76 --> 0:1:14,32
Rich has finished with me.


17
0:1:14,32 --> 0:1:18,6
It's hardly surprising. You were
getting off with people behind his back.


18
0:1:18,6 --> 0:1:20,72
How come he finished with you ?


19
0:1:20,72 --> 0:1:23,88
Cos I was getting off with people
behind his back.


20
0:1:23,88 --> 0:1:27,88
- How did he find out ?
- Well, I told him. Y'know...


21
0:1:27,88 --> 0:1:30,48
You... You told me to tell him.


22
0:1:30,48 --> 0:1:33,6
You said it would clear the air, you know.


23
0:1:33,6 --> 0:1:35,68
Strengthen our relationship.


24
0:1:35,68 --> 0:1:39,8
- I didn't mean it !
- Oh, you're evil.


25
0:1:39,8 --> 0:1:43,4
I'm not the deceiver here.
I'm not the cheating harpy !


26
0:1:43,4 --> 0:1:45,48
You're so damaged.


27
0:1:45,48 --> 0:1:51,2
Just cos Sarah hurt you, you're wreaking
your petty vengeance on womankind.


28
0:1:51,2 --> 0:1:52,84
Yes.


29
0:1:52,84 --> 0:1:54,28
Yes.


30
0:1:54,28 --> 0:2:7,68
And I'd do it again, I tell you !
I'd do it again in an instant !


31
0:2:7,68 --> 0:2:10,76
Sorry. Sorry. So, um,...


32
0:2:10,76 --> 0:2:12,84
Are you OK ?


33
0:2:12,84 --> 0:2:17,92
Yeah, yeah. I'm fine, I s'pose. I mean...


34
0:2:17,92 --> 0:2:22,32
It was inevitable really. Neither of us
were giving it the time it deserved.


35
0:2:22,32 --> 0:2:24,68
It was... It was my fault.


36
0:2:24,68 --> 0:2:26,92
I just... I feel...


37
0:2:26,92 --> 0:2:36,48
- Tim !
- What ? You said you were fine.


38
0:2:36,48 --> 0:2:39,28
Brian ?


39
0:2:39,28 --> 0:2:44,52
Brian ?


40
0:2:44,52 --> 0:3:0,12
Brian ?


41
0:3:0,12 --> 0:3:4,64
Er, no ! Johnny !


42
0:3:4,64 --> 0:3:7,16
Agh ! Er...


43
0:3:7,16 --> 0:3:9,12
Oh...  !


44
0:3:9,12 --> 0:3:11,32
Help me, I'm stuck.


45
0:3:11,32 --> 0:3:13,8
"Why should I ?" this, "Why should I ?" that !


46
0:3:13,8 --> 0:3:17,32
Why don't you start taking
some responsibility in your life ?


47
0:3:17,32 --> 0:3:21,88
Leave me alone !


48
0:3:21,88 --> 0:3:25,84
Don't think I'm going to tidy it !
It'll remain in that state till you return !


49
0:3:25,84 --> 0:3:31,76
<i>That's if you return. Quite frankly,
I don't give two shits if you come back or not !</i>


50
0:3:31,76 --> 0:3:35,12
Ooh ! Hello, kitten. Fancy a dab of Rioja ?


51
0:3:35,12 --> 0:3:45,4
Oh, just a splash.


52
0:3:45,4 --> 0:3:48,76
- Can I borrow a tea bag ?
- Only if you bring it back.


53
0:3:48,76 --> 0:3:53,4
You can have a tea bag, Brian,
you can't borrow one.


54
0:3:53,4 --> 0:3:55,28
What are you playing ?


55
0:3:55,28 --> 0:3:57,6
Tomb Raider III.


56
0:3:57,6 --> 0:3:59,76
She's drowning.


57
0:3:59,76 --> 0:4:1,4
Yeah.


58
0:4:1,4 --> 0:4:5,4
- Is that the point of the game ?
- Depends what mood you're in, really.


59
0:4:5,4 --> 0:4:6,96
What sort of mood you in, then ?


60
0:4:6,96 --> 0:4:10,4
Well, I just got a letter from my ex-girlfriend,
three months late,


61
0:4:10,4 --> 0:4:12,52
explaining why she dumped me.


62
0:4:12,52 --> 0:4:15,84
It was full of "You'll always be special"
and "I'll always love you" platitudes


63
0:4:15,84 --> 0:4:19,72
designed to make me feel better
while appeasing her sense of guilt


64
0:4:19,72 --> 0:4:24,68
for running off with a slimy City boy called
Duane and destroying my faith in everything.


65
0:4:24,68 --> 0:4:32,52
- So it didn't really work, then ?
- No, it made me wanna drown things !


66
0:4:32,52 --> 0:4:34,96
You've got some paint on you.


67
0:4:34,96 --> 0:4:38,64
It's a literal tribute
to the self-reflexivity of Rembrandt.


68
0:4:38,64 --> 0:4:41,48
- Did he like it ?
- He's dead.


69
0:4:41,48 --> 0:4:48,4
Bloody hell, that really backfired.


70
0:4:48,4 --> 0:4:51,92
Tell me all about it, kitten.


71
0:4:51,92 --> 0:4:54,4
Split up with my boyfriend.


72
0:4:54,4 --> 0:4:57,32
Oh, well,... I can't say I'm surprised.


73
0:4:57,32 --> 0:5:1,8
I heard Tim shouting at you
a couple of nights ago, I was shocked.


74
0:5:1,8 --> 0:5:6,2
- What ?
- "You stupid cow." Something about a key.


75
0:5:6,2 --> 0:5:9,52
"You can't shoot straight, you big-titted bitch."


76
0:5:9,52 --> 0:5:13,12
No... No, no, that was Lara Croft.


77
0:5:13,12 --> 0:5:15,52
- Well, it sounded like Tim.
- No, it was Tim.


78
0:5:15,52 --> 0:5:21,8
He was talking to Lara Croft, a video-game
character. He gets very frustrated.


79
0:5:21,8 --> 0:5:23,92
Is that what the problem was ?


80
0:5:23,92 --> 0:5:29,12
- What do you mean ?
- Is that why you split, he's got no patience ?


81
0:5:29,12 --> 0:5:32,24
<i>Shit !</i>


82
0:5:32,24 --> 0:5:36,8
"If we pretend we're a couple,
this flat could be ours."


83
0:5:36,8 --> 0:5:38,52
"It's madness ! It'll never work !"


84
0:5:38,52 --> 0:5:42,4
"Trust me, Tim, she'll never find out."


85
0:5:42,4 --> 0:5:44,44
Trust me, Tim,
she'll never find out.


86
0:5:44,44 --> 0:5:45,84
Shut up !


87
0:5:45,84 --> 0:5:47,84
Think ! Think, think !


88
0:5:47,84 --> 0:5:50,4
Think. I'm thinking...


89
0:5:50,4 --> 0:5:53,68
Could Tim and I, could we have...
Could we have...


90
0:5:53,68 --> 0:5:55,4
There, right in front of you !


91
0:5:55,4 --> 0:5:57,84
- a plate ?
- Dog !


92
0:5:57,84 --> 0:6:3,88
- A dog !
- Yeah, good one( !)


93
0:6:3,88 --> 0:6:7,8
<i>- A dog ?
- A dog. A dog,</i>


94
0:6:7,8 --> 0:6:9,36
Cos... if we had a dog,


95
0:6:9,36 --> 0:6:14,4
then it would help us stay together
because it would be like having a child,


96
0:6:14,4 --> 0:6:17,92
only hairier, smaller, wilder, quicker, smellier.


97
0:6:17,92 --> 0:6:20,4
I don't see why not.


98
0:6:20,4 --> 0:6:25,92
Well,... good.
I've always wanted a dog actually.


99
0:6:25,92 --> 0:6:29,96
All right, mate, yeah.
No, I'm really looking forward to it.


100
0:6:29,96 --> 0:6:33,48
We're going to kick some serious ass, mofo.


101
0:6:33,48 --> 0:6:43,36
Yeah, all right, I'll see you later. Over and out.


102
0:6:43,36 --> 0:6:45,2
Who was that ?


103
0:6:45,2 --> 0:6:47,92
It was Mike. We're going paintballing later.


104
0:6:47,92 --> 0:6:50,52
- I thought he was banned ?
- No, only for six months.


105
0:6:50,52 --> 0:6:56,2
How does that poor accountant feel about it ?


106
0:6:56,2 --> 0:7:0,28
I dunno.


107
0:7:0,28 --> 0:7:3,8
- What you doing ? !
- Marsha says that we can have a dog.


108
0:7:3,8 --> 0:7:10,8
- What ? !
- We can have a dog ! Isn't that great ?


109
0:7:10,8 --> 0:7:15,28
Stop it ! What d'you want a dog for, you'll
only end up seeing other dogs on the side ?


110
0:7:15,28 --> 0:7:17,76
Don't you want to get a dog ?


111
0:7:17,76 --> 0:7:20,88
- No.
- Why not ? What are you frightened of ?


112
0:7:20,88 --> 0:7:23,8
I'm not frightened of anything,
why would I be frightened ?

114
0:7:38,12 --> 0:7:40,32
You're scared of them, aren't you ?


115
0:7:40,32 --> 0:7:43,24
- No.
- Yes, you are.


116
0:7:43,24 --> 0:7:45,96
All right, I had a minor phobia
when I was a kid.


117
0:7:45,96 --> 0:7:48,4
- How minor ?
- I had to have counselling.


118
0:7:48,4 --> 0:7:50,24
Really ? Sorry.


119
0:7:50,24 --> 0:7:55,64
She said I had canophobia. I thought
"Great, now I'm frightened of bamboo too."


120
0:7:55,64 --> 0:7:58,2
- How many times did you go ?
- Three or four.


121
0:7:58,2 --> 0:8:0,44
It started to work, you know.


122
0:8:0,44 --> 0:8:3,64
She said I had as much chance
of being struck by lightning


123
0:8:3,64 --> 0:8:6,2
as I had of being bitten by a dog.


124
0:8:6,2 --> 0:8:8,24
So... what's the problem ?


125
0:8:8,24 --> 0:8:12,44
Well, I was leaving the practice one day,
feeling really well-adjusted and happy,


126
0:8:12,44 --> 0:8:15,96
<i>and this fucking great Alsatian
came haring down the road towards me,</i>

the fires of Hades' eternal damned kingdom.


128
0:8:20,0 --> 0:8:21,36
It leapt into the air,


129
0:8:21,36 --> 0:8:25,88
I remember thinking "This is it,
I'm seven years old and this is the end."


130
0:8:25,88 --> 0:8:28,76
Fortunately, Lady Luck
was smiling at me that day.


131
0:8:28,76 --> 0:8:31,4
- What happened ?
- I got struck by lightning.


132
0:8:31,4 --> 0:8:34,48
- What ? !
- It hurt but it scared the shit out of the dog.


133
0:8:34,48 --> 0:8:40,16
<i>- Now you're scared of dogs and lightning ?
- And bamboo.</i>


134
0:8:40,16 --> 0:8:42,24
It's funny, really.


135
0:8:42,24 --> 0:8:45,44
I always really wanted a dog
when I was... little.


136
0:8:45,44 --> 0:8:47,64
But I wasn't allowed one.


137
0:8:47,64 --> 0:8:52,96
Really ?


138
0:8:52,96 --> 0:8:55,72

139
0:8:55,72 --> 0:9:0,8
Oh, please play with me, please !


140
0:9:0,8 --> 0:9:2,16
I don't know, Daisy.


141
0:9:2,16 --> 0:9:5,8
Look, I know I've sprung this on you,
you know ?


142
0:9:5,8 --> 0:9:10,4
If you don't like it, I'll understand. But...


143
0:9:10,4 --> 0:9:12,68
I really need this, you know ?


144
0:9:12,68 --> 0:9:17,4
I mean,... I'll do everything for it, you know ?


145
0:9:17,4 --> 0:9:22,44
I'll feed it and I'll walk it
and I'II... I'll change its little hutch.


146
0:9:22,44 --> 0:9:25,84
And if you still don't like it, then, well,...


147
0:9:25,84 --> 0:9:30,44
we'll kill it.


148
0:9:30,44 --> 0:9:32,48
- All right.
- Wahoo !


149
0:9:32,48 --> 0:9:35,28
- But not a big one.
- All right. Sorry !


150
0:9:35,28 --> 0:9:38,72
Sorry, sorry. It could be good for you,
it could be the turning point.


151
0:9:38,72 --> 0:9:40,96
It might help you conquer your fear.


152

Stop trying to get your own way

by turning everything into a psychodrama
that somehow benefits me, OK ?


154
0:9:46,72 --> 0:9:51,4

my problems in whatever way I see fit.

- Mm. My parents were hippies.

I see. What can I do for you ?

Yes, I'd like to buy a dog.


167
0:10:26,4 --> 0:10:29,44
Yes, erm... there.


168
0:10:29,44 --> 0:10:32,32
Have you owned a dog before ?

0:10:32,32 --> 0:10:34,36
Mm,... sort of.

No.


174

Now, I want you to think very carefully
before you choose a dog.


175
0:10:49,68 --> 0:10:55,4
Can I afford to keep it ? Will I be able
to take it for walks twice a day, if not more ?


176
0:10:55,4 --> 0:10:59,44
Can I give it a secure, loving home ?


177

Um,...


178
0:11:1,64 --> 0:11:10,64

you're only gonna be hurting yourself.

0:12:5,8 --> 0:12:8,6
No ! No ! No !


198
0:12:8,6 --> 0:12:11,28
Come on, Colin,
we're taking you away from this place !


199
0:12:11,28 --> 0:12:26,88
- Colin ?
- That's what I called my box.


200
0:12:26,88 --> 0:12:30,32
Hi, Dom, yeah. This is Duane Benzie.


201
0:12:30,32 --> 0:12:35,8
This is Duane Benzie.
How you doing ?


202
0:12:35,8 --> 0:12:58,36
(Baywatch Theme)


203
0:12:58,36 --> 0:13:3,44
Tim, your girlfriend's very beautiful.


204
0:13:3,44 --> 0:13:6,24
(Psycho Theme)


205
0:13:6,24 --> 0:13:9,44
Tim, hi. I didn't expect to see you here.


206
0:13:9,44 --> 0:13:12,4
You never struck me as the outdoor type.


207
0:13:12,4 --> 0:13:13,52
What ?


208
0:13:13,52 --> 0:13:16,4
That reminds me.
You left some stuff at the flat.


209
0:13:16,4 --> 0:13:19,0
Well, I think it's your stuff.


210
0:13:19,0 --> 0:13:22,56
The bag was full of comics and toys.


211
0:13:22,56 --> 0:13:26,76
I was thinking maybe I'd drop it round
in the car, save you the trip.


212
0:13:26,76 --> 0:13:29,44
You stole my girlfriend.


213
0:13:29,44 --> 0:13:32,72
Tim, now come on.


214
0:13:32,72 --> 0:13:34,76
I didn't want it to be like this.


215
0:13:34,76 --> 0:13:38,76
It wasn't meant to be personal.
You don't choose who you fall in love with.


216
0:13:38,76 --> 0:13:40,64
When you get that feeling, it's like...


217
0:13:40,64 --> 0:13:45,2
- Sexual.
- Like a force beyond your control.


218
0:13:45,2 --> 0:13:47,32
You know what they say about love and war ?


219
0:13:47,32 --> 0:13:52,16
Yeah, one involves a lot of physical and
psychological pain and the other one's war.


220
0:13:52,16 --> 0:13:54,84
Talking of which, what team are you on,
A or B ?


221
0:13:54,84 --> 0:13:58,12
Er, we're B.


222
0:13:58,12 --> 0:14:2,52
Me too.
Looks like we'll be fighting side by side.


223
0:14:2,52 --> 0:14:11,76
Who knows, maybe that's what we need.


224
0:14:11,76 --> 0:14:15,44
Later.


225
0:14:15,44 --> 0:14:18,48
I've rehearsed that moment a thousand times.


226
0:14:18,48 --> 0:14:21,88
- Is that the first time you've seen him since...
- Yes.


227
0:14:21,88 --> 0:14:23,16
I think I was pretty cool.


228
0:14:23,16 --> 0:14:27,24
I could have flown off the handle, smashed
his face in, set fire to him, but I didn't.


229
0:14:27,24 --> 0:14:31,56
- What will you do when you see him next ?
- I'm gonna set fire to him.


230
0:14:31,56 --> 0:14:34,76
Hello ! Hello ! Hello !


231
0:14:34,76 --> 0:14:38,88
Ahh ! Now, you stay there ! You stay there !


232
0:14:38,88 --> 0:14:41,36
Mummy's going to make a cup of tea.


233
0:14:41,36 --> 0:14:45,36
Ahh ! We're gonna be best friends.
We're gonna have such fun.


234
0:14:45,36 --> 0:14:49,32
Ahh ! Do you want something to eat ?
- Yes, please.


235
0:14:49,32 --> 0:14:51,76
Where is it, then ?


236
0:14:51,76 --> 0:14:57,8
The little dog ?


237
0:14:57,8 --> 0:14:59,4
The bandanna, isn't it ?
It makes me look stupid.


238
0:14:59,4 --> 0:15:2,4
- Ahh !
- Do you want me to take it off ?


239
0:15:2,4 --> 0:15:6,0
- C-Colin.
- No, Daisy, it's Brian.


240
0:15:6,0 --> 0:15:10,24
I think you're sitting on my dog.


241
0:15:10,24 --> 0:15:14,16
Oh, my God.


242
0:15:14,16 --> 0:15:17,76
Look, I'll count to three...


243
0:15:17,76 --> 0:15:19,8
and then stand up.


244
0:15:19,8 --> 0:15:22,8
- OK ?
- I can't watch.


245
0:15:22,8 --> 0:15:24,68
One,...


246
0:15:24,68 --> 0:15:29,68
two,...


247
0:15:29,68 --> 0:15:30,48
three.


248
0:15:30,48 --> 0:15:42,32
Go ! Go ! Go !


249
0:15:42,32 --> 0:15:45,36
- The flag's to the northwest.
- How do you know ?


250
0:15:45,36 --> 0:15:46,44
I've just seen it.


251
0:15:46,44 --> 0:15:49,32
- Oh, this is so exciting !
- Is this your first time, kid ?


252
0:15:49,32 --> 0:15:51,4
- I'm 36.
- Is this your first time, old man ?


253
0:15:51,4 --> 0:15:54,12
Yeah. I've always fancied myself
as a bit of a soldier.


254
0:15:54,12 --> 0:15:56,16
- I've always fancied myself.
- I've always fancied you.


255
0:15:56,16 --> 0:15:57,2
Not here.


256
0:15:57,2 --> 0:15:59,16
- Have you ever done this before ?
- You could say that.


257
0:15:59,16 --> 0:16:0,6
What do you mean ?


258
0:16:0,6 --> 0:16:5,8
Let's just say the last time I was in this
situation, I wasn't using a paintball gun.


259
0:16:5,8 --> 0:16:7,56
You've seen combat ? Where ?


260
0:16:7,56 --> 0:16:9,6
Erm,... on the television.


261
0:16:9,6 --> 0:16:13,16
You said the last time you were
in this situation you didn't use a paintball gun.


262
0:16:13,16 --> 0:16:15,2
- He didn't.
- What did you use ?


263
0:16:15,2 --> 0:16:17,12
It was a big stick.


264
0:16:17,12 --> 0:16:19,28
- I'm going for the flag.
- You shouldn't do that.


265
0:16:19,28 --> 0:16:22,4
We're deep in enemy territory,
we've got to choose our moment carefully.


266
0:16:22,4 --> 0:16:26,8
<i>This place is swarming with A's, they're
not just in the jungle, they are the jungle.</i>


267
0:16:26,8 --> 0:16:34,4
What do you think this is, Vietnam ?


268
0:16:34,4 --> 0:16:42,44
Yeah.


269
0:16:42,44 --> 0:16:44,92
Son of a bitch !


270
0:16:44,92 --> 0:16:48,64
He didn't mean it ! He didn't mean it !
You didn't mean it.


271
0:16:48,64 --> 0:16:51,88
Say "I didn't mean it, Colin."


272
0:16:51,88 --> 0:16:55,68
- I didn't mean it, Colin.
- No, like I said it.


273
0:16:55,68 --> 0:16:57,72
I didn't mean it, Colin.


274
0:16:57,72 --> 0:17:0,4
There. Yes, good boy !


275
0:17:0,4 --> 0:17:2,8
He's beautiful.


276
0:17:2,8 --> 0:17:4,16
Reminds me of my own dog, Pompom.


277
0:17:4,16 --> 0:17:7,88
- I didn't know you had a dog.
- As a child, yeah.


278
0:17:7,88 --> 0:17:10,6
Used to spend hours
playing together in the garden.


279
0:17:10,6 --> 0:17:14,64
I'd dress him up in period costumes
and take amusing photographs.


280
0:17:14,64 --> 0:17:16,68
Loved him so much.


281
0:17:16,68 --> 0:17:19,12
It was tragic, really.


282
0:17:19,12 --> 0:17:20,56
Why ?


283
0:17:20,56 --> 0:17:22,96
One day we were playing in the street,


284
0:17:22,96 --> 0:17:28,6
I was taking some pictures of him
dressed as an Elizabethan merchant.


285
0:17:28,6 --> 0:17:31,92
Suddenly, something caught his eye.


286
0:17:31,92 --> 0:17:34,36
Maybe it was a stray tomcat


287
0:17:34,36 --> 0:17:37,8
or a brightly coloured ball
bouncing out of sight,


288
0:17:37,8 --> 0:17:40,4
or maybe the stick I threw.


289
0:17:40,4 --> 0:17:44,24
He ran out into the main road,


290
0:17:44,24 --> 0:17:47,52
exploded under an articulated lorry.


291
0:17:47,52 --> 0:17:49,56
He blew up ?


292
0:17:49,56 --> 0:17:55,76
No, the weight of the truck on his frail body
burst him like a cheap party balloon,


293
0:17:55,76 --> 0:18:1,68
sending his ruff forty feet into the air.


294
0:18:1,68 --> 0:18:4,52
There, you see ?


295
0:18:4,52 --> 0:18:9,8
Such vibrant colours.


296
0:18:9,8 --> 0:18:13,24
That paintball was meant for me,
he's made this personal.


297
0:18:13,24 --> 0:18:15,28
He made it personal
when he slept with your girlfriend.


298
0:18:15,28 --> 0:18:17,16
Now he's made it more personal.


299
0:18:17,16 --> 0:18:19,24
Doesn't get more personal
than sleeping with your girlfriend.


300
0:18:19,24 --> 0:18:20,64
For Christ's sake, Mike !


301
0:18:20,64 --> 0:18:23,68
Have you ever considered thinking about
what you're gonna say before you say it ?


302
0:18:23,68 --> 0:18:27,52
Perhaps you could set up a checkpoint
to vet your thoughts for insensitivity.


303
0:18:27,52 --> 0:18:31,96
You hate me. You're only going out with me
cos of what happened when we were little.


304
0:18:31,96 --> 0:18:36,0
Oh !


305
0:18:36,0 --> 0:18:38,88
<i>Mike !</i>


306
0:18:38,88 --> 0:18:42,84
Mike ?


307
0:18:42,84 --> 0:18:45,32
Mike !


308
0:18:45,32 --> 0:18:49,36
You know, Daisy,
this is gonna be a big responsibility.


309
0:18:49,36 --> 0:18:52,64
Dogs are like kids: want, want, want.


310
0:18:52,64 --> 0:18:56,0
He is a little life.


311
0:18:56,0 --> 0:19:0,44
He has needs.


312
0:19:0,44 --> 0:19:3,2
I know, Marsha, I do, I really do.


313
0:19:3,2 --> 0:19:7,12
I'm not just gonna discard him
as soon as he's served his purpose.


314
0:19:7,12 --> 0:19:11,6
He's a living thing,
he's not just some kind of novelty toy.


315
0:19:11,6 --> 0:19:14,8
Come on, little Colin, dance for me !


316
0:19:14,8 --> 0:19:17,32
Ha, ha, ha ! Dance !


317
0:19:17,32 --> 0:19:20,48
Yes, come on, Colin, dance, dance !


318
0:19:20,48 --> 0:19:23,88
Dance, dance, dance, dance...


319
0:19:23,88 --> 0:19:27,44
- Oh !
- Dance for me ! Dance !


320
0:19:27,44 --> 0:19:30,88
- Dance !
- Ha ! Ha ! Ha !


321
0:19:30,88 --> 0:19:36,52
Mike.


322
0:19:36,52 --> 0:19:40,84
Mike.


323
0:19:40,84 --> 0:19:44,84
Mike.


324
0:19:44,84 --> 0:19:51,12
Mike.


325
0:19:51,12 --> 0:19:55,12
Saved by the bell.


326
0:19:55,12 --> 0:19:58,6
- Aren't you gonna answer that ?
- I've got an answering service.


327
0:19:58,6 --> 0:20:3,2
<i>- You've got an answer for everything.
- I can't believe you just said that.</i>


328
0:20:3,2 --> 0:20:5,24
Neither can...


329
0:20:5,24 --> 0:20:7,32
Neither can I.


330
0:20:7,32 --> 0:20:11,2
Tim, firing these guns at such close range
is very dangerous.


331
0:20:11,2 --> 0:20:14,52
- You were just about to shoot me.
- In the back of the head, yeah.


332
0:20:14,52 --> 0:20:17,36
In the face, it's a lot different.


333
0:20:17,36 --> 0:20:23,48
Look, if we're gonna do this,
let's at least be sporting about it.


334
0:20:23,48 --> 0:20:27,4
What do you say, 20 paces ?


335
0:20:27,4 --> 0:20:40,52
- OK.
- OK.


336
0:20:40,52 --> 0:20:44,92
Ha !


337
0:20:44,92 --> 0:20:53,4
Oh.


338
0:20:53,4 --> 0:20:54,84
Ha, ha, ha.


339
0:20:54,84 --> 0:20:56,96
You see, Tim,


340
0:20:56,96 --> 0:21:1,16
that's the difference between you and I.


341
0:21:1,16 --> 0:21:3,72
Organisation.


342
0:21:3,72 --> 0:21:6,8
Careful thinking.


343
0:21:6,8 --> 0:21:8,24
Forward planning.


344
0:21:8,24 --> 0:21:11,88
That is why I sleep in the arms
of a beautiful woman


345
0:21:11,88 --> 0:21:16,24
and you spend your evenings alone
in your bedsit.


346
0:21:16,24 --> 0:21:19,2
With cheap porn.


347
0:21:19,2 --> 0:21:37,52
Timmmmy !


348
0:21:37,52 --> 0:21:39,52
It's not a bedsit.


349
0:21:39,52 --> 0:21:42,24
It's a flat.


350
0:21:42,24 --> 0:21:43,76
Aarrgghh !


351
0:21:43,76 --> 0:21:45,6
Yes !


352
0:21:45,6 --> 0:21:48,56
No, Mike ! Mike !


353
0:21:48,56 --> 0:21:51,76
Mike ! Oh, Jesus, no !


354
0:21:51,76 --> 0:21:54,84
Medic !


355
0:21:54,84 --> 0:21:56,68
Is that you, Tim ?


356
0:21:56,68 --> 0:21:58,92
I'm here, man, just hold on, hold on !


357
0:21:58,92 --> 0:22:0,88
I'm tired, Tim.


358
0:22:0,88 --> 0:22:5,24
Just, er...
Everything's gonna be fine, I promise.


359
0:22:5,24 --> 0:22:9,24
I'm sorry I said those things,
I just... I wasn't thinking straight.


360
0:22:9,24 --> 0:22:12,84
I can say pretty stupid things myself,
sometimes.


361
0:22:12,84 --> 0:22:15,88
Oh, Mike, I'm the stupid one,
I've always been the stupid one.


362
0:22:15,88 --> 0:22:18,64
What you laughing at ?


363
0:22:18,64 --> 0:22:21,16
I guess I got to be the hero after all.


364
0:22:21,16 --> 0:22:24,24
Yeah, I guess you did.


365
0:22:24,24 --> 0:22:26,68
I've gotta... I've gotta sleep.


366
0:22:26,68 --> 0:22:28,52
No, no, Mike, stay with me !


367
0:22:28,52 --> 0:22:31,24
- I'm so tired.
- No, Mike !


368
0:22:31,24 --> 0:22:41,6
- Bye, old friend.
- No, Mike !


369
0:22:41,6 --> 0:22:44,8
No !


370
0:22:44,8 --> 0:22:47,84
- I really enjoyed that today.
- Me too.


371
0:22:47,84 --> 0:22:53,24
- You always enjoy it.
- I enjoyed it more than usual.


372
0:22:53,24 --> 0:22:55,8
I feel cleansed. It's been a really good day.


373
0:22:55,8 --> 0:22:59,12
That, my friend,
is the beauty of simulated violence.


374
0:22:59,12 --> 0:23:3,16
Let's pick up Daisy and go down the pub.
I haven't got a care in the world.


375
0:23:3,16 --> 0:23:7,24
Hey, viano tormenty.


376
0:23:7,24 --> 0:23:9,28
What did you say ?


377
0:23:9,28 --> 0:25:9,28
I said there's a storm coming.
