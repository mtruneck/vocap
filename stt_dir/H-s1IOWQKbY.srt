197
0:9:45,42 --> 0:9:47,17
But, sure.


198
0:9:47,17 --> 0:9:52,12
Crashing is part of the aura
of racing, and when crashes


199
0:9:52,12 --> 0:9:54,59
occur, it's usually because
somebody's pushing the limit,


200
0:9:54,59 --> 0:9:58,44
and you're going just a little
bit over the edge.


201
0:9:58,44 --> 0:10:0,55
And usually that's
very, very fast.


202
0:10:0,55 --> 0:10:2,48
JAKE GAGNE: If you race
motorcycles you've got to


203
0:10:2,48 --> 0:10:4,97
expect you're going to crash
sooner or later.


204
0:10:4,97 --> 0:10:7,81
You've just got to accept it,
try not to think about it.


205
0:10:7,81 --> 0:10:10,62
Sometimes it can be bad,
sometimes you can walk away


206
0:10:10,62 --> 0:10:12,8
and not even feel anything.


207
0:10:12,8 --> 0:10:13,65
Just depends how it is.


208
0:10:13,65 --> 0:10:16,66
But you just got to learn
to accept it.


209
0:10:16,66 --> 0:10:19,34
KEVIN SCHWANTZ: I think the
certain amount of danger, some


210
0:10:19,34 --> 0:10:21,55
guys are willing to take that
risk a little bit more than


211
0:10:21,55 --> 0:10:25,34
the other, and that's those
guys that can push the


212
0:10:25,34 --> 0:10:28,74
envelope, recover from it, and
still go back there time and


213
0:10:28,74 --> 0:10:29,99
time again.


214
0:10:29,99 --> 0:10:32,32



215
0:10:32,32 --> 0:10:34,32
JEREMY APPLETON: While
motorcycle racing is still a


216
0:10:34,32 --> 0:10:39,72
dangerous activity there are
less broken limbs compared


217
0:10:39,72 --> 0:10:43,18
with what their used to be,
partly because we've built


218
0:10:43,18 --> 0:10:48,68
technology into the suits and
the equipment which aims to


219
0:10:48,68 --> 0:10:52,36
keep riders sliding during the
course of an accident, so


220
0:10:52,36 --> 0:10:55,53
dissipating energy during the
course of an accident.


221
0:10:55,53 --> 0:10:59,31
There are certain accidents
where, inevitably, limbs or


222
0:10:59,31 --> 0:11:2,26
bones get broken because of
the sheer forces involved.


223
0:11:2,26 --> 0:11:8,57
But generally speaking, riders
these days are less prone to


224
0:11:8,57 --> 0:11:12,5
the sort of injuries they
occur through violent,


225
0:11:12,5 --> 0:11:13,784
uncontrolled crashes.


226
0:11:13,784 --> 0:11:17,18
PETER CLIFFORD: A decade or 2
ago, the sport was a lot more


227
0:11:17,18 --> 0:11:20,7
individual then, and a
lot more dangerous.


228
0:11:20,7 --> 0:11:22,95
Now it's more of a team sport.


229
0:11:22,95 --> 0:11:25,92
The team that you ride for and
the people around you matter


230
0:11:25,92 --> 0:11:28,75
more, and it's a lot less
dangerous than it used to be.


231
0:11:28,75 --> 0:11:32,75
You've got to be unlucky to get
very seriously hurt now,


232
0:11:32,75 --> 0:11:34,69
and terribly unlucky
to get killed.


233
0:11:34,69 --> 0:11:37,55
MARC GAGNE: You've got people
out there that are doing


234
0:11:37,55 --> 0:11:40,13
something that 1 millionth
of the population


235
0:11:40,13 --> 0:11:41,41
could possibly do.


236
0:11:41,41 --> 0:11:44,36
Me being on the edge of my
seat, my heart racing--


237
0:11:44,36 --> 0:11:46,7
I mean, I can't go
do it anymore.


238
0:11:46,7 --> 0:11:49,39
But I can definitely get that
feeling by watching it,


239
0:11:49,39 --> 0:11:52,0
especially when you know
somebody or, in my case, I'm


240
0:11:52,0 --> 0:11:53,57
lucky enough to have my
son that does it.


241
0:11:53,57 --> 0:13:53,57
