1
0:0:16,2 --> 0:0:20,88
And on the third day, there was
a marriage in Cana of Galilee.


2
0:0:20,88 --> 0:0:25,281
And it came to pass that all
the wine was drunk.


3
0:0:25,281 --> 0:0:28,362
And the mother of Jesus said unto the Lord:


4
0:0:28,362 --> 0:0:30,841
"They have no more wine".


5
0:0:30,841 --> 0:0:36,83
And Jesus said unto the servants:
"Fill six waterpots with water. "


6
0:0:36,83 --> 0:0:38,243
And they did so.


7
0:0:38,243 --> 0:0:42,683
And when the steward of the feast
did taste of the water from the pots,


8
0:0:42,683 --> 0:0:45,724
it had become wine.


9
0:0:45,724 --> 0:0:52,485
And they knew not whence,
it had come.


10
0:0:52,485 --> 0:0:55,166
But the servants did know.


11
0:0:55,166 --> 0:1:6,487
And they applauded loudly in the kitchen.


12
0:1:6,487 --> 0:1:14,928
And they said unto the Lord:
"How the hell did you do that?"


13
0:1:14,928 --> 0:1:23,729
And inquired of him
"Do you do children's parties"


14
0:1:23,729 --> 0:1:26,1
And the Lord said:


15
0:1:26,1 --> 0:1:28,57
"No".


16
0:1:28,57 --> 0:1:36,11
But the servants did press him, saying:
"Go on, give us another one!"


17
0:1:36,11 --> 0:1:39,172
And so he brought forth a carrot.


18
0:1:39,172 --> 0:1:43,692
and said:
"Behold this, for it is a carrot. "


19
0:1:43,692 --> 0:1:48,333
And all about him knew that it was so.


20
0:1:48,333 --> 0:1:51,613
For it was orange,


21
0:1:51,613 --> 0:1:54,574
with a green top.


22
0:1:54,574 --> 0:1:58,815
And he did place a large red cloth over
the carrot, and then removed it


23
0:1:58,815 --> 0:2:3,535
and lo, he held in his hand, a white rabbit.


24
0:2:3,535 --> 0:2:11,16
And all were amazed, and said:
"This guy is really good!"


25
0:2:11,16 --> 0:2:14,777
"He should turn professional. "


26
0:2:14,777 --> 0:2:19,298
And they brought him on a stretcher
a man who was sick of the palsy.


27
0:2:19,298 --> 0:2:25,219
And they cried unto him:
"Maestro, this man is sick of the palsy. "


28
0:2:25,219 --> 0:2:30,99
And the Lord said: "If I had to
spend my whole life on a stretcher,


29
0:2:30,99 --> 0:2:34,6
I'd be pretty sick of the palsy, too!"


30
0:2:34,6 --> 0:2:37,2
And they were filled with joy.


31
0:2:37,2 --> 0:2:40,381
And cried out:
"Lord, thy one-liners are


32
0:2:40,381 --> 0:2:42,422
as good as thy tricks.


33
0:2:42,422 --> 0:2:48,182
Thou art indeed an all-round
family entertainer. "


34
0:2:48,182 --> 0:2:53,622
And there came unto him a woman called
Mary, who had seen the Lord and believed.


35
0:2:53,622 --> 0:2:55,983
And Jesus said unto her:


36
0:2:55,983 --> 0:2:58,984
"Put on a tutu,


37
0:2:58,984 --> 0:3:1,705
and lie down in this box. "


38
0:3:1,705 --> 0:3:7,465
And then took he forth a saw
and cleft her in twain.


39
0:3:7,465 --> 0:3:11,226
And there was much wailing
and gnashing of teeth.


40
0:3:11,226 --> 0:3:15,586
But Jesus said:
"Oh ye of little faith!"


41
0:3:15,586 --> 0:3:20,187
And he threw open the box and lo,
Mary was whole.


42
0:3:20,187 --> 0:3:23,947
And the crowd went absolutely bananas.


43
0:3:23,947 --> 0:3:27,268
And Jesus and Mary took a big bow.


44
0:3:27,268 --> 0:3:34,109
And he said unto her:
"From now on you shall be known as Sharon,


45
0:3:34,109 --> 0:3:37,79
for that is a good name for an assistant. "


46
0:3:37,79 --> 0:3:41,35
And the people said unto him:
"We've never seen anything like this.


47
0:3:41,35 --> 0:3:45,431
This is great.
You must be the Son of God. "


48
0:3:45,431 --> 0:3:49,951
But the Lord said:
"No. I am he who comes before. "


49
0:3:49,951 --> 0:3:52,232
And they were amazed, and said:


50
0:3:52,232 --> 0:3:55,32
"Master how shall we know
the true Lord. "


51
0:3:55,32 --> 0:3:59,473
And jesus said:
"By his name shall you know him. "


52
0:3:59,473 --> 0:4:2,513
And he shall have a very religious name.


53
0:4:2,513 --> 0:4:5,433
And he shall be call Paul.


54
0:4:5,433 --> 0:4:8,594
And Daniel, shall he be call'


55
0:4:8,594 --> 0:4:12,35
Paul Daniels!
They cried.


56
0:4:12,35 --> 0:4:14,475
And the Lord said:


57
0:4:14,475 --> 0:4:16,315
Yes.


58
0:4:16,315 --> 0:4:18,556
Something like that.


59
0:4:18,556 --> 0:4:38,3
Here endeth the lesson.


60
0:4:38,3 --> 0:4:41,104
Well now, Mr. Perkins.
It was good of you to come in.


61
0:4:41,104 --> 0:4:43,22
I realise that you're a busy man,


62
0:4:43,22 --> 0:4:47,65
but I didn't think this matter could be
discussed over the electric telephone.


63
0:4:47,65 --> 0:4:51,836
No. No, absolutely, Headmaster, I mean,
if Tommy is in some sort of trouble,


64
0:4:51,836 --> 0:4:53,437
then I'd like to nip it in the bud.


65
0:4:53,437 --> 0:4:55,992
Well, quite frankly, Tommy is in trouble.


66
0:4:55,992 --> 0:4:59,704
Recently his behaviour has left
a great deal to be desired.


67
0:4:59,704 --> 0:5:0,702
Dear.


68
0:5:0,702 --> 0:5:4,893
He seems to take no interest in
school life whatsoever.


69
0:5:4,893 --> 0:5:8,285
He refuses to muck in at
the sports field.


70
0:5:8,285 --> 0:5:12,476
And it's weeks since any master has
received any written work from him.


71
0:5:12,476 --> 0:5:13,914
Oh, dear me.


72
0:5:13,914 --> 0:5:30,239
Quite frankly, Mr Perkins, if he
wasn't dead, I'd have him expelled.


73
0:5:30,239 --> 0:5:32,354
I beg your pardon?


74
0:5:32,354 --> 0:5:38,541
Yes, EXPELLED!


75
0:5:38,541 --> 0:5:41,536
If I wasn't making allowances for
the fact that your son is dead,


76
0:5:41,536 --> 0:5:42,772
he'd be out on his ear!


77
0:5:42,772 --> 0:5:47,42
- Tommy, is dead?
- Yes. He's lying up there in sick bay now,


78
0:5:47,42 --> 0:5:50,196
stiff as a board and bright green,


79
0:5:50,196 --> 0:5:55,424
and this is, I fear,
typical of his current attitude.


80
0:5:55,424 --> 0:5:58,139
You see, the boy has no sense
of moderation


81
0:5:58,139 --> 0:6:1,332
one moment he's flying around
like a paper kite,


82
0:6:1,332 --> 0:6:4,246
and the next moment he's
completely immovable.


83
0:6:4,246 --> 0:6:7,399
And beginning to smell.


84
0:6:7,399 --> 0:6:9,794
Well, how did he die?!


85
0:6:9,794 --> 0:6:15,342
- Well, is that important?
- Why, yes, I think so!


86
0:6:15,342 --> 0:6:18,335
Well... Well... Well, it's all got to
do with the library, you see.


87
0:6:18,335 --> 0:6:22,127
We've had a lot of trouble recently with
boys taking out library books


88
0:6:22,127 --> 0:6:23,964
without library cards.


89
0:6:23,964 --> 0:6:29,392
Your son was caught, and I administered
a beating, during which he died.


90
0:6:29,392 --> 0:6:34,701
But you'll be glad to know... You'll be glad
to know that the ringleader was caught,


91
0:6:34,701 --> 0:6:39,12
so I don't think we'll be having any
trouble with library discipline.


92
0:6:39,12 --> 0:6:41,406
- You see, the library card system...
- I'm sorry...


93
0:6:41,406 --> 0:6:42,524
...was...


94
0:6:42,524 --> 0:6:46,396
- You beat my son to death?
- Yes, yes, so it would seem.


95
0:6:46,396 --> 0:6:48,75
Please, I'm not used to
being interrupted.


96
0:6:48,75 --> 0:6:51,145
You see, the library card system
was introduced...


97
0:6:51,145 --> 0:6:52,382
Well, exactly what happened?


98
0:6:52,382 --> 0:6:56,494
Well, apparently, boys were just slipping
into the library and taking the books!


99
0:6:56,494 --> 0:6:58,729
No, during the beating!


100
0:6:58,729 --> 0:7:0,325
Oh, that? Well...


101
0:7:0,325 --> 0:7:3,718
well, one moment he was bending over, the
next moment he was lying down, I mean, er...


102
0:7:3,718 --> 0:7:7,111
- Dead?
- Mmm... deadish!...


103
0:7:7,111 --> 0:7:12,859
Mr. Perkins, I find this morbid fascination
with your son's death


104
0:7:12,859 --> 0:7:18,48
quite disturbing. What I'm talking
about is his attitude!


105
0:7:18,48 --> 0:7:20,762
And quite frankly, I can see
where he gets it from.


106
0:7:20,762 --> 0:7:23,37
Well, it wasn't me that beat
my son to death!


107
0:7:23,37 --> 0:7:26,629
Well, that was perfectly obvious to me
from the first day he arrived here.


108
0:7:26,629 --> 0:7:28,67
I wondered then, as I wonder now,


109
0:7:28,67 --> 0:7:30,98
if he might not have turned out
a very different boy indeed


110
0:7:30,98 --> 0:7:36,608
if you had administrated
a few fatal beatings earlier.


111
0:7:36,608 --> 0:7:41,438
- Are you mad!?
- I'm FURIOUS!


112
0:7:41,438 --> 0:7:48,24
In order to accommodate the funeral, I had
to cancel afternoon school on Wednesday!


113
0:7:48,24 --> 0:7:51,736
- This is preposterous!
- Yes, it is.


114
0:7:51,736 --> 0:7:54,849
Or at least, it would be...


115
0:7:54,849 --> 0:8:2,593
if it were true.


116
0:8:2,593 --> 0:8:6,225
- ... What?
- I've been joking, Mr Perkins.


117
0:8:6,225 --> 0:8:10,376
Pardon me, it's my strange academic
sense of humour.


118
0:8:10,376 --> 0:8:14,607
- I've been pulling your leg.
- Oh, thank God!


119
0:8:14,607 --> 0:8:25,2
I wouldn't cancel afternoon school
to bury that little shit!


120
0:8:25,2 --> 0:8:29,972
Alright, come on, settle down please.


121
0:8:29,972 --> 0:8:33,726
Answer your names.


122
0:8:33,726 --> 0:8:39,796
Anus.


123
0:8:39,796 --> 0:8:45,985
Arsebandit.


124
0:8:45,985 --> 0:8:51,57
Bottom.


125
0:8:51,57 --> 0:8:54,531
Clitoris.


126
0:8:54,531 --> 0:9:2,598
Where are you, Clitoris?


127
0:9:2,598 --> 0:9:5,993
Dodo.


128
0:9:5,993 --> 0:9:10,426
Enema.


129
0:9:10,426 --> 0:9:16,296
Fistup


130
0:9:16,296 --> 0:9:24,562
Come on, grow up please.


131
0:9:24,562 --> 0:9:29,675
Genital.


132
0:9:29,675 --> 0:9:35,744
I'm sorry, Genital.


133
0:9:35,744 --> 0:9:38,7
Herpes.


134
0:9:38,7 --> 0:9:44,57
Still with us I see.


135
0:9:44,57 --> 0:9:50,81
Imadick.


136
0:9:50,81 --> 0:9:53,476
Imadick!


137
0:9:53,476 --> 0:10:2,78
Enema, you know Imadick don't you?


138
0:10:2,78 --> 0:10:5,696
Jaculation.


139
0:10:5,696 --> 0:10:9,25
Myprick.


140
0:10:9,25 --> 0:10:13,203
Has anybody seen Myprick?


141
0:10:13,203 --> 0:10:18,35
Come on!
Somebody must have seen Myprick!


142
0:10:18,35 --> 0:10:26,62
Very well.
Remind me to beat Myprick a bit later.


143
0:10:26,62 --> 0:10:29,696
Nicenquick.


144
0:10:29,696 --> 0:10:32,731
Ontop.


145
0:10:32,731 --> 0:10:37,483
Pube.
Ahhh, Myprick! So good of you to turn up.


146
0:10:37,483 --> 0:10:41,78
Yes. Well now that you are here Myprick,
perhaps you'd like to find a seat.


147
0:10:41,78 --> 0:10:55,215
Bottom, squeeze Myprick in there
somewhere will you?


148
0:10:55,215 --> 0:10:58,9
Rigid.


149
0:10:58,9 --> 0:11:9,831
Our Russian exchange student,
Suckmeoff.


150
0:11:9,831 --> 0:11:12,466
Tightfit.


151
0:11:12,466 --> 0:11:15,222
Upyours.


152
0:11:15,222 --> 0:11:17,6
Vulva.


153
0:11:17,6 --> 0:11:18,417
Yourprick.


154
0:11:18,417 --> 0:11:23,449
And Zipper.
Zipper?


155
0:11:23,449 --> 0:11:25,246
Absent.


156
0:11:25,246 --> 0:11:27,179
Now then boys, the headmaster
has asked me...


157
0:11:27,179 --> 0:11:32,34
...to speak to you this
morning on the subject of smut.


158
0:11:32,34 --> 0:11:35,708
All members of staff have noticed an alarming
increase of the use of silly humour


159
0:11:35,708 --> 0:11:38,185
and puerile innuendo about the school.


160
0:11:38,185 --> 0:11:46,93
Rigid, Fistup, Bottom,
Out!


161
0:11:46,93 --> 0:11:50,365
There have been some disgusting
doodlings on the walls of the lavatories.


162
0:11:50,365 --> 0:11:53,52
Sit up straight Ontop.


163
0:11:53,52 --> 0:11:56,76
One or two unpleasant health
magazines have been found.


164
0:11:56,76 --> 0:12:3,424
If you fall asleep Ontop,
I shall be VERY annoyed.


165
0:12:3,424 --> 0:12:4,795
And Mr Hardon tells me that...


166
0:12:4,795 --> 0:12:7,577
...there has been a great deal
of sniggerin in his biology class.


167
0:12:7,577 --> 0:12:12,808
Tightfit, for heaven's sake,
leave Yourprick alone!


168
0:12:12,808 --> 0:12:16,602
I don't care, Yourprick had no business
poking into your desk in the first place.


169
0:12:16,602 --> 0:12:19,158
I will not put up with this kind
of behaviour boys,


170
0:12:19,158 --> 0:12:22,912
and neither, must I warn you will
Mr. Gripbighardcock.


171
0:12:22,912 --> 0:12:25,228
This is a school for the sons
of gentlemen,


172
0:12:25,228 --> 0:12:27,944
and the theory is that oneday you
will become a gentleman too.


173
0:12:27,944 --> 0:12:34,214
That is with the exception of Genital, who
appears to be turning into a ferret.


174
0:12:34,214 --> 0:12:37,368
So there will be an end to this
second form toilet humour


175
0:12:37,368 --> 0:12:41,682
where so much conversation is
devoted to smutty double entendre.


176
0:12:41,682 --> 0:12:46,354
Dodo Suckmeoff Nicenquick,
detention Saturday.


177
0:12:46,354 --> 0:12:48,43
Right, I'm going to the staffroom now,


178
0:12:48,43 --> 0:12:54,66
but if I come back and catch Herpes in the
corridor like the headmaster did yesterday,


179
0:12:54,66 --> 0:13:3,802
then there'll be trouble!


180
0:13:3,802 --> 0:13:8,96
Do you have ever one of those days
when everything seems to go wrong?


181
0:13:8,96 --> 0:13:11,639
I did, and unfortunately,
it was my wedding day.


182
0:13:11,639 --> 0:13:14,556
And three men in
particular were to blame.


183
0:13:14,556 --> 0:13:18,234
It all started with the priest.


184
0:13:18,234 --> 0:13:23,311
I now pronounce you man and wife...


185
0:13:23,311 --> 0:13:24,631
well done.


186
0:13:24,631 --> 0:13:30,667
You may now kiss the bride...


187
0:13:30,667 --> 0:13:33,106
Nice one.


188
0:13:33,106 --> 0:13:34,865
All right, please be seated everybody.


189
0:13:34,865 --> 0:13:39,703
I'd just like to say a few words
before the communion.


190
0:13:39,703 --> 0:13:44,979
You know, a lot of prospective
brides ask me these days,


191
0:13:44,979 --> 0:13:57,172
"Father, what is the church's
attitude towards fellatio?"


192
0:13:57,172 --> 0:14:1,25
And I tend to reply by telling
them a little story


193
0:14:1,25 --> 0:14:16,721
about the first time I was
asked that question.


194
0:14:16,721 --> 0:14:19,96
It was a couple of years ago,


195
0:14:19,96 --> 0:14:23,158
a young attractive bride to be
came up to me after the service


196
0:14:23,158 --> 0:14:25,477
and asked me just that question.


197
0:14:25,477 --> 0:14:29,875
"Father, what is the church's
attitude towards fellatio?"


198
0:14:29,875 --> 0:14:35,191
And I replied, "Well, you know,
Joanne, I'd like to tell you,


199
0:14:35,191 --> 0:14:42,268
but unfortunately,
I don't know what fellatio is!"


200
0:14:42,268 --> 0:14:46,385
And so, she showed me.


201
0:14:46,385 --> 0:14:49,624
And ever since, whenever anyone
has asked me the question


202
0:14:49,624 --> 0:14:53,541
"Father, what is the church's
attitude towards fellatio?"


203
0:14:53,541 --> 0:14:59,459
I always reply,
"Well, you know, I'd like to tell you...


204
0:14:59,459 --> 0:15:14,409
but unfortunately,
I don't know what fellatio is!"


205
0:15:14,409 --> 0:15:18,327
Next, came my trusted best man.


206
0:15:18,327 --> 0:15:23,5
Um, all right, er... right, well...
huh-huh, huh-huh, right, erm...


207
0:15:23,5 --> 0:15:28,122
ladies and gentlemen and fellow survivors
of that stunning stag party...


208
0:15:28,122 --> 0:15:30,121
how did those two girls get
under the table


209
0:15:30,121 --> 0:15:35,238
and what the hell were they
up to with that toothpaste?


210
0:15:35,238 --> 0:15:37,636
Er... er, right, well,
erm... well, er... when,


211
0:15:37,636 --> 0:15:41,274
just before I left the house,
huh-huh, erm, this afternoon,


212
0:15:41,274 --> 0:15:42,923
huh-huh, I said to myself,
you know,


213
0:15:42,923 --> 0:15:45,432
the last thing you must
do is forget your speech.


214
0:15:45,432 --> 0:15:48,71
Er... mmm, well and sure enough, erm,


215
0:15:48,71 --> 0:15:53,108
erm, when I left the house... whoops!
Ha-ha, er... mm m,


216
0:15:53,108 --> 0:15:58,385
the last thing I did... ha-ha, yes, you
guessed it, well, was to forget my speech.


217
0:15:58,385 --> 0:16:21,932
So, erm... so it's all ad lib, I'm afraid.


218
0:16:21,932 --> 0:16:23,676
Er... er, er, er,...
right, well, well, well,


219
0:16:23,676 --> 0:16:26,609
dear me, well now, now,
when should I begin,


220
0:16:26,609 --> 0:16:29,408
haha-ha, I'd like to begin now.


221
0:16:29,408 --> 0:16:33,766
Huh-huh, er, right, well, well, well,


222
0:16:33,766 --> 0:16:37,404
I've known the groom ever since we first
went to school together at the age of eight.


223
0:16:37,404 --> 0:16:43,4
And you know, he hasn't changed a bit.


224
0:16:43,4 --> 0:16:48,637
Erm, well, that's not quite true, of course.
He didn't have his beard then, huh-huh, erm,


225
0:16:48,637 --> 0:16:51,396
and I'll tell you this, he wouldn't
have been able to do


226
0:16:51,396 --> 0:16:58,32
whatever he was doing last night
with those two extraordinary,


227
0:16:58,32 --> 0:17:4,269
extraordinary, erm... extraordinary
how little people change, isn't it?


228
0:17:4,269 --> 0:17:6,268
Huh-huh, yes, erm... er, although,
I know I changed a great deal


229
0:17:6,268 --> 0:17:10,586
because I used to be an absolute ass,


230
0:17:10,586 --> 0:17:13,663
always bleating things out when I shouldn't,
for instance, this afternoon.


231
0:17:13,663 --> 0:17:16,262
I'm sure I wouldn't have been
able to resist


232
0:17:16,262 --> 0:17:20,3
mentioning the bizarre sight that
greeted my eyes


233
0:17:20,3 --> 0:17:27,16
when I opened this man's bedroom door
earlier this morning, er... mmm.


234
0:17:27,16 --> 0:17:28,495
Yes, but, but, erm, enough of that, huh-huh,


235
0:17:28,495 --> 0:17:30,734
he started making gestures
at me now, which I think,


236
0:17:30,734 --> 0:17:36,211
huh-huh, means he wants me
to cut my speech short, erm.


237
0:17:36,211 --> 0:17:40,168
So, suffice to say that I'll think he'll
make a ripping husband, erm...


238
0:17:40,168 --> 0:17:43,926
then, I think his wife, ripping, too.


239
0:17:43,926 --> 0:17:50,963
Huh-huh. And I can only hope that, that the
dress will hold out, er, huh-huh, erm... so,


240
0:17:50,963 --> 0:17:54,201
so, I'd like to propose a toast,


241
0:17:54,201 --> 0:18:0,398
erm, to go with the pate,


242
0:18:0,398 --> 0:18:5,754
huh-huh... erm, huh-huh, to the groom and
to his lovely horse, erm, wife, huh-huh.


243
0:18:5,754 --> 0:18:9,313
It's all, it's all starting to come back
to me now, huh-huh, erm,


244
0:18:9,313 --> 0:18:14,989
And I just to know that their marriage
will be as happy and satisfying as I was


245
0:18:14,989 --> 0:18:30,741
when I paid off those two prostitutes
earlier this morning... cheers! Huh-huh...


246
0:18:30,741 --> 0:18:34,18
And finally, my loving father-in-law


247
0:18:34,18 --> 0:18:45,932
provided the perfect end to a perfect day...


248
0:18:45,932 --> 0:18:56,126
Ladies and gentlemen
and friends of my daughter.


249
0:18:56,126 --> 0:19:0,124
There comes a time in every
wedding reception


250
0:19:0,124 --> 0:19:3,803
when the man who paid
the for the damn thing...


251
0:19:3,803 --> 0:19:7,92
...is allowed to speak
a word or two of his own.


252
0:19:7,92 --> 0:19:11,358
And I should like to take this opportunity,


253
0:19:11,358 --> 0:19:14,476
sloshed as I may be,


254
0:19:14,476 --> 0:19:20,913
to say a word or two about Martin.


255
0:19:20,913 --> 0:19:23,951
As far as I'm concerned,


256
0:19:23,951 --> 0:19:31,986
my daughter could not have chosen a more
delightful, charming, witty, responsible,


257
0:19:31,986 --> 0:19:35,624
wealthy, let's not deny it,


258
0:19:35,624 --> 0:19:42,301
well-placed, good-looking and fertile


259
0:19:42,301 --> 0:19:46,178
young man than Martin as her husband.


260
0:19:46,178 --> 0:19:50,136
And I therefore ask the question


261
0:19:50,136 --> 0:19:59,452
"Why the hell did she marry Gerald instead?"


262
0:19:59,452 --> 0:20:4,768
...because Gerald is a sort of man
we used to describe at school


263
0:20:4,768 --> 0:20:10,606
as a complete prick!


264
0:20:10,606 --> 0:20:14,803
If I may use a gardening simile here,


265
0:20:14,803 --> 0:20:19,4
if his entire family may be likened
to a compost heap


266
0:20:19,4 --> 0:20:22,319
and I think they can


267
0:20:22,319 --> 0:20:25,797
then Gerald is the biggest weed
growing out of it.


268
0:20:25,797 --> 0:20:30,314
I think he's a sort of man people
emigrate to avoid.


269
0:20:30,314 --> 0:20:34,352
I remember the first time I met Gerald,
I said to my wife


270
0:20:34,352 --> 0:20:38,71
she's the lovely woman propping
up that old lush of a mother of his


271
0:20:38,71 --> 0:20:43,507
either this man is suffering
from serious brain damage


272
0:20:43,507 --> 0:20:49,664
or the new vacuum cleaner's just arrived.


273
0:20:49,664 --> 0:20:52,223
As for his family,
they are quite simply...


274
0:20:52,223 --> 0:20:56,339
...the most intolerable herd
of steaming social animals


275
0:20:56,339 --> 0:20:59,538
that I have ever had the misfortune of
turning my nose up to.


276
0:20:59,538 --> 0:21:4,256
I spurn you as I would spurn a rabid dog.


277
0:21:4,256 --> 0:21:8,134
I would like to propose a toast


278
0:21:8,134 --> 0:21:16,649
to the caterers.


279
0:21:16,649 --> 0:21:24,284
And to the pigeons who crapped on the
groom's family's limousine at the church.


280
0:21:24,284 --> 0:21:29,241
Er... as for the rest of you around
this table not directly related to me,


281
0:21:29,241 --> 0:21:32,12
you can sod off.


282
0:21:32,12 --> 0:21:49,0
I wouldn't trust any of you to sit
the right way on a toilet seat.


283
0:21:49,0 --> 0:21:51,676
Welcome back to the Oliver Theater Awards


284
0:21:51,676 --> 0:21:54,911
and we come now to the award for
Best Actor of the year.


285
0:21:54,911 --> 0:21:57,29
And the nominations for this year are:


286
0:21:57,29 --> 0:21:59,625
Al Pacino for
"Death of a Salesman"


287
0:21:59,625 --> 0:22:2,302
Kenneth Branagh for
"Richard III"


288
0:22:2,302 --> 0:22:5,737
And then two actors both in
the same remarkable new play,


289
0:22:5,737 --> 0:22:8,933
"Stench" by Harold Barkworthy.


290
0:22:8,933 --> 0:22:12,648
And the nominees are John Daniels
in the role of Mr. Trotter.


291
0:22:12,648 --> 0:22:15,923
And David Forbert in the role of Mr. Gannet.


292
0:22:15,923 --> 0:22:18,839
Now, these are four fine actors and
I’m sure they all agree


293
0:22:18,839 --> 0:22:21,675
that the point is not to win,
but to play the game...


294
0:22:21,675 --> 0:22:25,47
And the winner is...


295
0:22:25,47 --> 0:22:26,869
John Daniels!


296
0:22:26,869 --> 0:22:30,263
Oh, SHIT!


297
0:22:30,263 --> 0:22:33,379
Unfortunately, John is unable
to be with us tonight.


298
0:22:33,379 --> 0:22:37,494
So I would like to ask his co-star David
Falbert to accept the award on his behalf.


299
0:22:37,494 --> 0:22:49,997
David!


300
0:22:49,997 --> 0:22:51,475
David?


301
0:22:51,475 --> 0:23:2,58
David!
Perhaps you’d like to say a few words?


302
0:23:2,58 --> 0:23:7,174
Thank you Vanessa.


303
0:23:7,174 --> 0:23:11,767
Ladies and gentleman, what a
delight it is to accept this award


304
0:23:11,767 --> 0:23:15,682
on behalf of my close personal,


305
0:23:15,682 --> 0:23:19,437
acquaintance,
John Daniels.


306
0:23:19,437 --> 0:23:22,513
John cannot unfortunately
accept it himself


307
0:23:22,513 --> 0:23:25,3
because he is in Hollywood.


308
0:23:25,3 --> 0:23:28,745
staring in his first major film role...


309
0:23:28,745 --> 0:23:31,381
with Meryl Streep.


310
0:23:31,381 --> 0:23:35,495
I am however, NOT in Hollywood,


311
0:23:35,495 --> 0:23:42,725
not having been offeredeven a minor
role in a 8mm pornographic movie!


312
0:23:42,725 --> 0:23:46,56
But what a delightful object
it is that John has won.


313
0:23:46,56 --> 0:23:50,395
Although I am sure I will very soon
receive one myself,


314
0:23:50,395 --> 0:23:58,544
when I next buy ten gallons
of petrol at a Texaco.


315
0:23:58,544 --> 0:24:0,701
So what is it that Johnny has got


316
0:24:0,701 --> 0:24:4,696
that makes him stand apart from
other actors of his generation?


317
0:24:4,696 --> 0:24:7,572
Well, I think we all know
the answer to that one...


318
0:24:7,572 --> 0:24:12,46
syphilis!


319
0:24:12,46 --> 0:24:15,761
And what a great and heart
warming thing it is.


320
0:24:15,761 --> 0:24:21,752
That he has already started passing it on
to a whole new generation of young actors.


321
0:24:21,752 --> 0:24:24,389
Of course, to win an acting award is
always a great honor,


322
0:24:24,389 --> 0:24:28,104
but to receive one here in the heart of
London’s famous West End


323
0:24:28,104 --> 0:24:34,895
on an occasion such as this
HUGELY diminishes that honor.


324
0:24:34,895 --> 0:24:39,488
What could be more dull than the sordid,
back-slapping sessions


325
0:24:39,488 --> 0:24:44,721
where has-beens in tuxedos hand over
to even OLDER has-beens in tuxedos,


326
0:24:44,721 --> 0:24:48,316
awards for plays that closed the WEEK
before the opened,


327
0:24:48,316 --> 0:24:51,392
because the audience were
clamoring instead for tickets to


328
0:24:51,392 --> 0:24:54,908
Andrew Lloyd Webber’s LATEST
re-arrangementof Evita,


329
0:24:54,908 --> 0:24:59,861
to suture vocal range of Kylie Minogue.


330
0:24:59,861 --> 0:25:4,335
Therefore, I cannot say what a delight it is
that John has wonthis award instead of me.


331
0:25:4,335 --> 0:25:7,97
And I should like to announce my
retirement from the acting profession,


332
0:25:7,97 --> 0:25:12,963
in order to begin a lifetime of work
amongst the mentally handicapped.


333
0:25:12,963 --> 0:25:15,64
In which capacity I look forward
to meeting all the members


334
0:25:15,64 --> 0:25:25,72
of the judging panel,
very soon.


335
0:25:25,72 --> 0:25:30,276
Ashes to ashes.
Amen!


336
0:25:30,276 --> 0:25:34,113
We are gathered here today
on this beautiful autumn morning


337
0:25:34,113 --> 0:25:37,989
to pay our last respects to
Thomas Fairclough,


338
0:25:37,989 --> 0:25:41,746
Richard Mason
and Harold Walker.


339
0:25:41,746 --> 0:25:46,821
Tom, Dick and Harry.


340
0:25:46,821 --> 0:25:49,18
As they were known to all of us.


341
0:25:49,18 --> 0:25:55,412
Three stout fellows of our community
who will be sorely missed.


342
0:25:55,412 --> 0:25:58,849
Tom, sadly, was blind


343
0:25:58,849 --> 0:26:6,202
an affliction he bore with great fortitude.
Especially considering he was also deaf.


344
0:26:6,202 --> 0:26:9,799
His only power was that
of speech and song.


345
0:26:9,799 --> 0:26:14,154
And we all recall his enormous voice.


346
0:26:14,154 --> 0:26:18,271
Joining lustly in hymn singing.


347
0:26:18,271 --> 0:26:22,586
Of course, being blind and deaf,


348
0:26:22,586 --> 0:26:27,581
Tom never actually knew what
hymn he was singing,


349
0:26:27,581 --> 0:26:34,335
which seemed appropriate because we never
knew what hymn he was singing, either.


350
0:26:34,335 --> 0:26:40,9
In fact, if we had to be frank with each
other, Tom didn't actually know any hymns.


351
0:26:40,9 --> 0:26:43,287
Thus it was with deep gratitude
we recall the day when


352
0:26:43,287 --> 0:26:51,799
Colonel Grant, using only sense of touch,
through the medium of a clenched fist,


353
0:26:51,799 --> 0:26:54,916
actually broke through to Tom


354
0:26:54,916 --> 0:26:59,512
and got him to SHUT UP!


355
0:26:59,512 --> 0:27:2,798
Leading guidance through
the darkness of life,


356
0:27:2,798 --> 0:27:5,426
Tom was lucky to have
a friend like Dick.


357
0:27:5,426 --> 0:27:11,82
Dick had perfect eyesight, and would gladly
lead Tom wherever he wanted to go.


358
0:27:11,82 --> 0:27:16,255
Unfortunately since Dick was deaf,


359
0:27:16,255 --> 0:27:21,171
he couldn't actually here where
Tom wanted to go!


360
0:27:21,171 --> 0:27:26,846
Yet, like Tom, Dick never complained
about his afflictions, did he?


361
0:27:26,846 --> 0:27:28,923
Well he couldn't.


362
0:27:28,923 --> 0:27:31,161
He was dumb;


363
0:27:31,161 --> 0:27:34,998
but, blessed with gift of vision,
though stone deaf,


364
0:27:34,998 --> 0:27:41,951
he was a tremendous fan
of Olivia Newton-John.


365
0:27:41,951 --> 0:27:45,748
Being such an idiosyncratic pair,
deaf to the world about them,


366
0:27:45,748 --> 0:27:49,424
Tom and Dick were to have the permanent
companionship of Harry.


367
0:27:49,424 --> 0:27:53,101
Harry could literally here a pin drop.


368
0:27:53,101 --> 0:27:59,215
Though, being blind and dumb,
he could neither see to pick it up.


369
0:27:59,215 --> 0:28:3,251
nor warn anyone else not to stand on it.


370
0:28:3,251 --> 0:28:7,407
So, as individuals, they were
sadly afflicted,


371
0:28:7,407 --> 0:28:12,922
but together they were in possession
of all of God's senses, weren't they.


372
0:28:12,922 --> 0:28:18,197
And it is together, that we remember them.


373
0:28:18,197 --> 0:28:23,392
Together, at their job, checking eggs
at the battery farm.


374
0:28:23,392 --> 0:28:25,67
Dick would look for the cracks,


375
0:28:25,67 --> 0:28:28,427
Tom would complain to the foreman,


376
0:28:28,427 --> 0:28:33,822
and Harry would do the listening
to Radio One.


377
0:28:33,822 --> 0:28:37,445
Likewise in the evening when
they have returned from work...


378
0:28:37,445 --> 0:28:39,657
...they all sit on the big red couch.


379
0:28:39,657 --> 0:28:44,812
Dick watching the television,
Harry listening to the television


380
0:28:44,812 --> 0:28:51,326
and Tom insisting that is time
to buy a television.


381
0:28:51,326 --> 0:28:54,243
Sadly as we all know,


382
0:28:54,243 --> 0:28:59,318
three days ago, their peaceful
lives were ended.


383
0:28:59,318 --> 0:29:5,992
Dick saw the combine harvester


384
0:29:5,992 --> 0:29:11,67
Harry heard the combine harvester,
but neither could cry out.


385
0:29:11,67 --> 0:29:18,38
Tom, who could have cried out,
never had the faintest idea what hit him.


386
0:29:18,38 --> 0:29:25,54
And so, they were all harvester together.
Blended into oneness, at last.


387
0:29:25,54 --> 0:29:32,47
And now we trust are in heaven, as happy
as any, with that immortal host.


388
0:29:32,47 --> 0:29:35,924
Dick will see the Angel's choir,


389
0:29:35,924 --> 0:29:39,88
Harry will hear the Angel's choir,


390
0:29:39,88 --> 0:31:39,88
and no doubt, Tom will ruin it
for everybody.
