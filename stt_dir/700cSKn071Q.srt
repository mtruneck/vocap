CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: Glad you`re starting
your new week with CNN STUDENT NEWS. My name


2
0:0:16,689 --> 0:0:20,949
is Carl Azuz. We are going to start today
at the top of the U.S. Central Intelligence


3
0:0:20,949 --> 0:0:27,31
Agency. That organization, the CIA, will be
getting a new director, because the previous


4
0:0:27,31 --> 0:0:32,82
one resigned. On Friday, Director David Petraeus
turned in his resignation and admitted to


5
0:0:32,82 --> 0:0:38,44
cheating on his wife. This all started with
an FBI investigation into emails being sent


6
0:0:38,44 --> 0:0:43,53
by the woman who wrote Petraeus` biography.
The investigation turned up other emails that


7
0:0:43,53 --> 0:0:46,44
revealed the CIA director`s affair.


8
0:0:46,44 --> 0:0:50,269
Some congressional leaders, both Democrats
and Republicans, have raised questions about


9
0:0:50,269 --> 0:0:54,83
why they were not told about the investigation
sooner, since it could have had an impact


10
0:0:54,83 --> 0:1:0,199
on national security. The name David Petraeus
might be familiar to you. At different times,


11
0:1:0,199 --> 0:1:5,15
he was the commander of U.S. forces in both
Iraq and Afghanistan. He became CIA director


12
0:1:5,15 --> 0:1:9,65
in September of last year, after he officially
left the military.

0:1:11,92 --> 0:1:14,92
JONATHAN MANN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: I`m Jonathan
Mann, with another political jargon buster.


15
0:1:14,92 --> 0:1:20,51
What is the fiscal cliff? It is shorthand
for the potential economic disaster that`s


16
0:1:20,51 --> 0:1:26,79
facing Washington. In real terms, it`s the
$7 trillion in spending cuts and tax increases


17
0:1:26,79 --> 0:1:32,14
scheduled to go into effect the beginning
of January. President and members of Congress


18
0:1:32,14 --> 0:1:37,14
set the deadline themselves last year after
they failed to agree on how to reduce the


19
0:1:37,14 --> 0:1:42,95
U.S. debt. Now, time is almost up, and Democrats
and Republicans remain far apart on a deal


20
0:1:42,95 --> 0:1:48,3
that would reduce the deficit, reform the
tax system and U.S. entitlement programs like


21
0:1:48,3 --> 0:1:53,85
Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Analysts
warn if there is no agreement, it could cripple


22
0:1:53,85 --> 0:1:59,58
the U.S. economy and drive up unemployment.
Will the political standoff turn into an economic


23
0:1:59,58 --> 0:2:5,1
disaster? U.S. politicians hope to avoid running
off the fiscal cliff.


24
0:2:5,1 --> 0:2:6,62
(END VIDEOTAPE)


25
0:2:6,62 --> 0:2:11,39
AZUZ: As they work to avoid running off that
cliff, one of the other things that politicians


26
0:2:11,39 --> 0:2:16,409
will focus on is how much money Americans
pay in taxes. For anyone making less than


27
0:2:16,409 --> 0:2:22,79
$250,000 a year, Republicans and Democrats
want tax rates to stay the same, to stay where


28
0:2:22,79 --> 0:2:28,99
they are, but when it comes to those who make
more than $250,000, President Obama says they


29
0:2:28,99 --> 0:2:33,819
should pay more in taxes. Republican leaders,
like House Speaker John Boehner say they don`t


30
0:2:33,819 --> 0:2:35,829
want anyone`s taxes to go up.

32
0:2:37,629 --> 0:2:44,599
BAN KI-MOON, U.N. SECRETARY GENERAL: Education
is a fundamental human right. It is a pathway


33
0:2:44,599 --> 0:2:52,95
to development, tolerance and global citizenship.
Join us in our campaign to put education first,


34
0:2:52,95 --> 0:2:57,439
for Malala and girls and boys throughout the
world.


35
0:2:57,439 --> 0:3:0,719
(END VIDEO CLIP)


36
0:3:0,719 --> 0:3:7,249
AZUZ: All right. You heard U.N. Secretary
General Ban Ki-moon mention the name Malala.


37
0:3:7,249 --> 0:3:12,79
He was talking about Malala Yousufzai. She
is the Pakistani teenager who was shot by


38
0:3:12,79 --> 0:3:17,4
the Taliban because she stood up for education
rights for girls. Her efforts and the attack


39
0:3:17,4 --> 0:3:22,19
on her gained international attention, and
the United Nations declared November 10 as


40
0:3:22,19 --> 0:3:27,319
Malala Day. In her home country of Pakistan,
people marked the day by lighting candles


41
0:3:27,319 --> 0:3:32,939
and holding vigils in Malala`s honor. Meanwhile,
she isn`t in her home country. After the attack,


42
0:3:32,939 --> 0:3:37,93
Malala was transported to a hospital in England
for special treatment. Dan Rivers tells us


43
0:3:37,93 --> 0:3:39,189
how recovery is going.


44
0:3:39,189 --> 0:3:39,849
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


45
0:3:39,849 --> 0:3:45,529
DAN RIVERS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: It is staggering
to see Malala Yousufzai out of bed, with her


46
0:3:45,529 --> 0:3:51,26
father looking through some of the thousands
of get-well cards she`s received. It`s exactly


47
0:3:51,26 --> 0:3:57,279
a month since she was shot at pointblank range
by Taliban gunmen for her campaign for girls


48
0:3:57,279 --> 0:3:59,43
education in Pakistan.


49
0:3:59,43 --> 0:4:4,269
Despite the bullet passing through her head
and neck, she is able to talk. Doctors at


50
0:4:4,269 --> 0:4:8,9
Birmingham`s Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Britain
are still assessing the extent of the brain


51
0:4:8,9 --> 0:4:12,699
damage. Her only visitors so far have been
her immediate family.


52
0:4:12,699 --> 0:4:17,38
ZIAUDDIN YOUSUFZAI, MALALA`S FATHER: I`m awfully
thankful to all peace-loving well wishers


53
0:4:17,38 --> 0:4:25,41
of Malala Yousufzai, who strongly condemn
the assassination attempt on Malala, who pray


54
0:4:25,41 --> 0:4:33,3
for her health, and who support the great
cause of Malala Yousufzai, that is peace,


55
0:4:33,3 --> 0:4:36,55
education, freedom of thought and freedom
of expression.


56
0:4:36,55 --> 0:4:42,61
RIVERS: The cards have come from all over
the world. This one from Myanmar or Burma.


57
0:4:42,61 --> 0:4:48,93
Some are signed by entire households, some
by entire offices. Her story has touched people


58
0:4:48,93 --> 0:4:54,53
around the world. And there is now an Internet
campaign for Malala to win the Nobel Peace


59
0:4:54,53 --> 0:5:0,949
Prize. She`s yet to undergo surgery for her
skull and jaw in Britain, but judging by these


60
0:5:0,949 --> 0:5:7,3
pictures, she is in very good hands, surprising
everyone with her determination to recover.


61
0:5:7,3 --> 0:5:16,909
Dan Rivers, CNN, London.

63
0:5:23,31 --> 0:5:30,97
AZUZ: Americans celebrated Veterans Day yesterday,
honoring the men and women who`ve served in


64
0:5:30,97 --> 0:5:35,539
the U.S. armed forces. Events and parades
like this on in Atlanta took place across


65
0:5:35,539 --> 0:5:40,52
the country. President Obama was part of the
wreath laying ceremony at Arlington National


66
0:5:40,52 --> 0:5:44,36
Cemetery. During a speech afterward, he talked
about America`s commitment to those who have


67
0:5:44,36 --> 0:5:44,61
served.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


69
0:5:45,36 --> 0:5:52,409
BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE U.S.: Each
year, on the 11th day of the 11th month, we


70
0:5:52,409 --> 0:6:4,379
pause as a nation and as a people to pay tribute
to you, to thank you, to honor you, the heroes


71
0:6:4,379 --> 0:6:8,74
over the generations who have served this
country of ours with distinction.


72
0:6:8,74 --> 0:6:8,74
(END VIDEO CLIP)


73
0:6:8,74 --> 0:6:15,889
AZUZ: The Purple Heart is America`s oldest
military medal. It is awarded to men and women


74
0:6:15,889 --> 0:6:20,669
who have been killed or wounded in action
against an enemy of the United States. Now,


75
0:6:20,669 --> 0:6:24,58
over time, some of the Purple Hearts that
had been awarded had been lost, but there


76
0:6:24,58 --> 0:6:29,379
is one National Guardsman who is trying to
get some of these medals returned back home.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


78
0:6:30,21 --> 0:6:34,909
BARBARA MACNEVIN, DAUGHTER OF PURPLE HEART
RECEPIENT: My dad, Ralph W. Bingham (ph).


79
0:6:34,909 --> 0:6:40,4
He was the veteran of the first world war,
the big war. He lost his right leg fighting


80
0:6:40,4 --> 0:6:46,5
in France, and he received a Purple Heart
for that. We had it for many years in my home,


81
0:6:46,5 --> 0:6:47,259
where I grew up.


82
0:6:47,259 --> 0:6:49,139
ROBERT MACNEVIN, GRANDSON OF PURPLE HEART
RECEPIENT: Unbeknownst to us, it was lost


83
0:6:49,139 --> 0:6:53,52
in some manner in one his moves later in his
life.


84
0:6:53,52 --> 0:6:59,55
CAPT. ZACHARIAH FIKE, U.S. ARMY: I found Private
Ralph W. Bingham`s medal on Craigslist. This


85
0:6:59,55 --> 0:7:4,96
has been the calling of mine for about the
last three years. I locate lost or stolen


86
0:7:4,96 --> 0:7:9,189
medals. These are all the Purple Hearts that
I`m currently working. Some I`ve located to


87
0:7:9,189 --> 0:7:11,11
families, some I haven`t.


88
0:7:11,11 --> 0:7:15,53
I do these on my own time. I don`t consider
it a hobby. It`s more of a calling and an


89
0:7:15,53 --> 0:7:20,4
honor. I myself have a Purple Heart. It hangs
on the wall in my mother`s home, and I would


90
0:7:20,4 --> 0:7:26,4
hope that one day, if my medal was lost, someone
would do the same thing for me and my family.


91
0:7:26,4 --> 0:7:32,3
It is truly an honor to bring Private Bingham`s
Purple Heart home to his family, and I am


92
0:7:32,3 --> 0:7:34,319
again truly humbled by his sacrifice.


93
0:7:34,319 --> 0:7:38,509
It is a great honor to bring home his Purple
Heart. Thank you very much.


94
0:7:38,509 --> 0:7:43,409
B. MACNEVIN: The medal means a lot to me,
especially, and to our family.


95
0:7:43,409 --> 0:7:52,71
FIKE: I`m glad it is home to where it belongs,
and I`ll move on to the next medal.

97

AZUZ: Imagine creating something that you
intend to share with the world, but then it


98
0:7:58,9 --> 0:8:3,939
sits on the shelf for more than 60 years.
As World War II was winding down, U.S. Army


99
0:8:3,939 --> 0:8:8,259
Colonel stationed in the States composed a
symphony, but no one ever played it until


100
0:8:8,259 --> 0:8:9,759
now.

COL. HAROLD VAN HUEVELEN (RET.), COMPOSER:
Wonderful!

(END VIDEO CLIP)


105
0:8:30,77 --> 0:8:37,24
AZUZ: That was the symphony that Colonel Harold
Van Huevelen wrote in 1945. That was the composer


106
0:8:37,24 --> 0:8:43,12
himself, listening to the U.S. Army Band perform
his peace earlier this month. He`s 93 years


107
0:8:43,12 --> 0:8:47,94
old now and traveled across the country for
the performance. Colonel Van Huevelen says


108
0:8:47,94 --> 0:8:52,75
that the symphony tells the story of the war,
and it concludes with the peace that had been


109
0:8:52,75 --> 0:8:57,3
announced just before he wrote it. Of course,
a lot of us here at CNN STUDENT NEWS offer


110
0:8:57,3 --> 0:9:1,52
our thanks to America`s veterans. We`re going
to end today`s show with some images from


111
0:9:1,52 --> 0:9:5,77
Veterans Day events around the U.S. We`ll
see you again tomorrow for more CNN STUDENT
