NATISHA LANCE, CNN ANCHOR: So you may have
heard that the day after Thanksgiving is sometimes


2
0:0:4,13 --> 0:0:8,42
called Black Friday. But do you know why?
Well, you are about to find out. I`m Natisha


3
0:0:8,42 --> 0:0:25,82
Lance in for Carl, and this is CNN STUDENT
NEWS.


4
0:0:25,82 --> 0:0:31,14
War planes and rockets crossing paths in the
sky. Right now that`s part of daily life for


5
0:0:31,14 --> 0:0:35,579
people living in parts of Israel and Gaza.
The signs of the fight maybe in the air, but


6
0:0:35,579 --> 0:0:40,55
the impact is on the ground. This is an office
building in Gaza that`s been used by some


7
0:0:40,55 --> 0:0:45,98
media organizations. It was hit by an Israeli
air strike on Monday. Israel said Palestinian


8
0:0:45,98 --> 0:0:50,82
militants were hiding in there. Israel`s targets
include government buildings, police stations


9
0:0:50,82 --> 0:0:55,11
and the homes of Hamas officials. That`s the
terrorist group that took control of the government


10
0:0:55,11 --> 0:1:1,649
of Gaza in 2007. Israel has launched strikes
against more than 1300 sites since the fighting


11
0:1:1,649 --> 0:1:2,539
started.


12
0:1:2,539 --> 0:1:6,9
The rockets are flying in both directions.
In Gaza, militants from Hamas are launching


13
0:1:6,9 --> 0:1:11,75
them into Israel. More than 1000 rockets have
been fired from Gaza since the start of the


14
0:1:11,75 --> 0:1:16,24
conflict. On Monday, one of those hit a school
in southern Israel. It`s been closed since


15
0:1:16,24 --> 0:1:17,46
the fighting began.


16
0:1:17,46 --> 0:1:22,39
Now, CNN reporters are in Gaza and Israel
covering this conflict, and at times doing


17
0:1:22,39 --> 0:1:26,22
their job can put them near the fighting.
Now, you are about to see how they react in


18
0:1:26,22 --> 0:1:29,4
those situations. First, Anderson Cooper in
Gaza, then Frederick Pleitgen in Israel.


19
0:1:29,4 --> 0:1:30,29
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


20
0:1:30,29 --> 0:1:35,659
ANDERSON COOPER, CNN CORRESPONDENT: One family,
also two media centers built ....


21
0:1:35,659 --> 0:1:36,39
(explosion)


22
0:1:36,39 --> 0:1:37,119
Wow.


23
0:1:37,119 --> 0:1:44,59
Well, that was a rather large explosion. That
occurred -- if you just look out here - I


24
0:1:44,59 --> 0:1:49,329
can`t actually see where the impact (no sound)
that was, it`s actually set off a number of


25
0:1:49,329 --> 0:1:54,469
fire alarms. But that was probably the largest
explosion that we`ve heard just in the past


26
0:1:54,469 --> 0:1:59,509
-- really, in the past hour. There have been
a number of explosions in the last hour or


27
0:1:59,509 --> 0:2:2,909
two. But that one - that one was pretty loud.


28
0:2:2,909 --> 0:2:6,34
FREDERIK PLELTGEN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: OK,
we have an alarm going off right now. I`m


29
0:2:6,34 --> 0:2:9,94
going to have to seek cover. We are going
to go over here. Let`s take the camera off


30
0:2:9,94 --> 0:2:10,86
the tripod, though.


31
0:2:10,86 --> 0:2:22,77
All right. Seems like something impacted in
the distance, not sure how far away. OK, the


32
0:2:22,77 --> 0:2:22,9
alarm stopped.


33
0:2:22,9 --> 0:2:26,52
So, it seems the impact was quite away in
the distance, I would say, a couple of miles,


34
0:2:26,52 --> 0:2:29,76
probably, in the distance. There, over in
the sky, you probably won`t be able to see


35
0:2:29,76 --> 0:2:34,8
it here, there is an interceptor missile taking
off right now, that is the Iron Dome interceptor,


36
0:2:34,8 --> 0:2:38,15
right? If you just saw the flash in the sky,
that was a rocket coming out of Gaza that


37
0:2:38,15 --> 0:2:39,48
was just intercepted right now.


38
0:2:39,48 --> 0:2:40,6
(END VIDEOTAPE)


39
0:2:40,6 --> 0:2:44,319
LANCE: Now, you heard Fred Pleitgen mention
the Iron Dome. It`s Israeli Defense System


40
0:2:44,319 --> 0:2:49,23
that shoots down rockets coming in from Gaza,
so far it`s intercepted about 30 percent of


41
0:2:49,23 --> 0:2:53,61
those rockets. Frederik has more on this technology
and how it works.


42
0:2:53,61 --> 0:2:54,26
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


43
0:2:54,26 --> 0:2:58,709
PLELTGEN: This video shows an Iron Dome missile
intercepting a rocket fired from Gaza at Tel


44
0:2:58,709 --> 0:3:3,489
Aviv on Sunday.


45
0:3:3,489 --> 0:3:9,19
The defense system had just been installed
in Israel`s largest city a few hours earlier.


46
0:3:9,19 --> 0:3:14,19
Several days into the conflict, it`s already
clear: the Iron Dome is having a big impact


47
0:3:14,19 --> 0:3:16,209
picking off hundreds of rockets.


48
0:3:16,209 --> 0:3:20,819
I got a tour of the Israel aircraft industry`s
plant that assembles the air defense system.


49
0:3:20,819 --> 0:3:23,68
DR. ISRAEL OZNOWICH: Deployment is the matter
of minutes.


50
0:3:23,68 --> 0:3:29,3
PLELTGEN: Dr. Israel Oznowich is one of those
in charge. One key element is an advanced


51
0:3:29,3 --> 0:3:29,459
radar.


52
0:3:29,459 --> 0:3:36,1
OZNOWICH: The radar such as locates, tracks
and intercepts and guides the intercepting


53
0:3:36,1 --> 0:3:41,17
missiles within several seconds, few seconds
within the launching time.


54
0:3:41,17 --> 0:3:45,629
PLELTGEN: It`s extremely hard to shoot down
short distance rockets like the ones coming


55
0:3:45,629 --> 0:3:50,84
out of Gaza, in part because they are not
in the air for older radar systems to lock


56
0:3:50,84 --> 0:3:51,42
onto them.

AUNG SAN SUU KYI, DEMOCRACY ADVOCATE: I would
like to say how happy I am to receive President


60
0:3:57,67 --> 0:4:3,799
Obama in my country and in my house. The friendship
between our two countries is of long standing.


61
0:4:3,799 --> 0:4:8,86
The United States has been staunch in its
support of the democracy movement in Burma,


62
0:4:8,86 --> 0:4:13,73
and we are confident that this support will
continue through the difficult years that


63
0:4:13,73 --> 0:4:14,31
lie ahead.


64
0:4:14,31 --> 0:4:20,6
I say difficult, because the most difficult
time in any transition is when we think that


65
0:4:20,6 --> 0:4:21,93
success is in site.


66
0:4:21,93 --> 0:4:25,199
(END VIDEO CLIP)


67
0:4:25,199 --> 0:4:29,56
LANCE: There was some history happening right
there, in that video. President Obama was


68
0:4:29,56 --> 0:4:34,66
visiting the home of Aung San Suu Kyi, that
home is in Myanmar and Barack Obama is the


69
0:4:34,66 --> 0:4:39,58
first American president to go there. It was
the middle stop on his trip to Asia. He went


70
0:4:39,58 --> 0:4:44,34
there after visiting in Thailand and before
going to a conference in Cambodia. Myanmar,


71
0:4:44,34 --> 0:4:49,9
which used to be knows as Burma, was the big
focus of this trip. For decades, it was closed


72
0:4:49,9 --> 0:4:53,56
off from the rest of the world, denied political
freedoms and people who pushed for democracy


73
0:4:53,56 --> 0:4:58,78
like Suu Kyi were punished. The country has
started making some reforms and during the


74
0:4:58,78 --> 0:5:3,8
president`s visit he said, also some changes
could lead to incredible opportunities for


75
0:5:3,8 --> 0:5:5,8
Myanmar and its people.

0:5:6,34 --> 0:5:12,759
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It`s time for the "Shoutout."
In the economic world, what color is associated


78
0:5:12,759 --> 0:5:19,72
with profits? If you think you know it, then
shout it out. Is it green? Blue? Red? Or Black?


79
0:5:19,72 --> 0:5:24,16
You`ve got three seconds, go!


80
0:5:24,16 --> 0:5:33,479
When a company is making a profit, it`s said
to be in the black. That`s your answer and


81
0:5:33,479 --> 0:5:35,25
that`s your "Shoutout."


82
0:5:35,25 --> 0:5:37,2
(END VIDEO CLIP)


83
0:5:37,2 --> 0:5:42,9
LANCE: That`s why this Friday is called Black
Friday, the day after Thanksgiving officially


84
0:5:42,9 --> 0:5:46,479
takes off the holiday shopping season. It`s
one of the busiest shopping days of the entire


85
0:5:46,479 --> 0:5:51,41
year, and it`s when stores make enough sales
to hopefully put themselves in the black.


86
0:5:51,41 --> 0:5:56,479
Some stores aren`t waiting for Black Friday
to start Black Friday. Wal-Mart, Sears, Target


87
0:5:56,479 --> 0:6:0,949
and Toys R Us are some of the stores that
are open on Thanksgiving evening. That might


88
0:6:0,949 --> 0:6:5,24
sound good to shoppers, but not to some of
the employees who work there. They`ve started


89
0:6:5,24 --> 0:6:9,36
petitions against the early openings, so that
workers can spend Thanksgiving with their


90
0:6:9,36 --> 0:6:13,86
own families. Some Wal-Mart employees are
planning to protest by walking off the job


91
0:6:13,86 --> 0:6:15,38
on Black Friday.


92
0:6:15,38 --> 0:6:20,419
And before they sit down for Thanksgiving,
or head out shopping on Black Friday, a lot


93
0:6:20,419 --> 0:6:24,34
of people have to get where they are going
for the holiday. According to AAA, more than


94
0:6:24,34 --> 0:6:29,58
43 million Americans are expected to travel
at least 50 miles for Thanksgiving. Most of


95
0:6:29,58 --> 0:6:33,69
those will be going by car, but more than
3 million will be traveling by plane. So,


96
0:6:33,69 --> 0:6:38,33
if you are heading to the airport, don`t expect
to see too many empty seats on your flights.


97
0:6:38,33 --> 0:6:43,13
So, let`s talk about college for a minute.
There is still some time before applications


98
0:6:43,13 --> 0:6:46,949
are due at most schools, but how do you pick
which college to apply to?


99
0:6:46,949 --> 0:6:51,63
There is a lot to consider, there is location,
what programs are offered, how much it costs,


100
0:6:51,63 --> 0:6:52,93
and how are you going to pay for it.


101
0:6:52,93 --> 0:6:56,8
Those last two are what Christine Romans looks
at in this report.


102
0:6:56,8 --> 0:6:56,69
(BEIGN VIDEOTAPE)


103
0:6:56,69 --> 0:7:0,789
CHRISTIANE ROMANS, CNN CORRESPONDENT: At this
college fare high school junior Veronica Woodley


104
0:7:0,789 --> 0:7:2,21
is exploring her options.


105
0:7:2,21 --> 0:7:8,41
VERONICA WOODLEY, HIGH SCHOOL JUNIOR: Finding
schools that had premed and I can major in


106
0:7:8,41 --> 0:7:10,21
biology to become a dermatologist. And to
also minor in Spanish.


107
0:7:10,21 --> 0:7:14,47
ROMANS: Picking the right college is a high
stakes decision with a high price tag. Average


108
0:7:14,47 --> 0:7:20,37
tuition for a year at a public college is
more than $22000 for in-state students. A


109
0:7:20,37 --> 0:7:27,5
private college, more than $43,000. Community
colleges cost $15,000 a year. Not all kids


110
0:7:27,5 --> 0:7:33,2
borrow for college, but those who do, graduate
with $27,000 in debt on average. With a price


111
0:7:33,2 --> 0:7:38,77
tag like that college choice is a careful
investment that depends on the student`s talents


112
0:7:38,77 --> 0:7:39,81
and finances.


113
0:7:39,81 --> 0:7:44,58
Most important, you have to graduate from
school in four years, no more five years,


114
0:7:44,58 --> 0:7:48,81
and you have to pick the right school. If
you haven`t saved any money, you can`t pick


115
0:7:48,81 --> 0:7:52,729
the super expensive school and graduate five
years later.


116
0:7:52,729 --> 0:7:57,97
For students like Veronica and her mom Kathy,
it`s an exciting time. And a lesson in high


117
0:7:57,97 --> 0:8:1,629
finance. They are crunching the numbers and
considering all the options.


118
0:8:1,629 --> 0:8:7,71
WOODLEY: I mean on scholarships, financial
aid, and then - I work, but my mom - -I think


119
0:8:7,71 --> 0:8:14,52
like my mom will do most of they paying, but
I mean I will help her out, of course.

LANCE: Thanksgiving is only two days away,
and we ask you to tell us what you are thankful


123
0:8:20,96 --> 0:8:24,389
for. And you definitely didn`t hesitate with
sharing with us.


124
0:8:24,389 --> 0:8:29,8
Betsaida said she is thankful for the holidays,
family and friends, as well as Thanksgiving


125
0:8:29,8 --> 0:8:32,789
day, because it reminds us of what we are
most thankful for.


126
0:8:32,789 --> 0:8:37,349
Ms. Risley`s reading class told us they are
thankful for good health, a safe home and


127
0:8:37,349 --> 0:8:40,99
family members, plus they are grateful to
the soldiers who keep us safe and for living


128
0:8:40,99 --> 0:8:42,539
in the USA.


129
0:8:42,539 --> 0:8:47,45
Victoria is thankful for this country as well,
and how it`s prospering even during the tough


130
0:8:47,45 --> 0:8:52,48
time. Sarah is thankful her great grandmother
is still alive and will be turning 90 year


131
0:8:52,48 --> 0:8:54,649
old. Happy birthday, Grandma.


132
0:8:54,649 --> 0:8:59,209
Ronnie is being raised to be a young man,
thanks to his mom, and he`s also thankful


133
0:8:59,209 --> 0:9:1,8
for his great education and good grades.


134
0:9:1,8 --> 0:9:5,67
While we all could probably agree with Peri
on this one, who is thankful for everything


135
0:9:5,67 --> 0:9:9,83
that makes us smile. And so many of you wrote
that you are thankful for your family, your


136
0:9:9,83 --> 0:9:14,72
friends and even for CNN STUDENT NEWS. But
we are definitely grateful for all of you,


137
0:9:14,72 --> 0:9:18,54
too. And we are also thankful for the people
who sent an I-report on this topic, so if


138
0:9:18,54 --> 0:9:22,94
you go to the spotlight section on our home
page, you`ll find a link to watch those. But


139
0:9:22,94 --> 0:9:27,29
before we go, we are going to check out this
cardboard village. They young people who you


140
0:9:27,29 --> 0:9:32,6
see putting it together, right there, they
are planning to camp out there overnight.


141
0:9:32,6 --> 0:9:36,5
This was in Colorado, and yes, it`s going
to be cold, but that was the point: they were


142
0:9:36,5 --> 0:9:40,2
trying to raise awareness about homelessness
by facing some of the challenges that the


143
0:9:40,2 --> 0:9:45,51
homeless regularly deal with. It`s a good
cause and a good story to wrap up our week.


144
0:9:45,51 --> 0:9:49,97
CNN STUDENT NEWS returns on Monday, and we
hope you all have a very happy Thanksgiving.


145
0:9:49,97 --> 0:11:49,97
Until then, I`m Natisha Lance.
