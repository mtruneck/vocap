CHRISTIAN VON KOENIGSEGG:
My name is Christian Von


3
0:0:4,33 --> 0:0:5,7
Koenigsegg.


4
0:0:5,7 --> 0:0:6,335
I'm 40 years old.


5
0:0:6,335 --> 0:0:8,66
And for half of my life I've
been on the quest to be a


6
0:0:8,66 --> 0:0:11,94
leader in the hypercar industry,
utilizing Swedish


7
0:0:11,94 --> 0:0:14,605
design combined with visionary
technical solutions.


8
0:0:14,605 --> 0:0:18,3



9
0:0:18,3 --> 0:0:22,185
Our latest car, the Agera R, is
built in the old hangers of


10
0:0:22,185 --> 0:0:24,83
a former Swedish fighter
jet squadron.


11
0:0:24,83 --> 0:0:28,46
Their symbol, a ghost, is now
proudly painted on the back of


12
0:0:28,46 --> 0:0:29,74
every Koenigsegg.


13
0:0:29,74 --> 0:0:55,975
[MUSIC PLAYING]


14
0:0:55,975 --> 0:0:57,33
CHRISTIAN VON KOENIGSEGG: So
now I'm going to show you


15
0:0:57,33 --> 0:1:0,4
something which we are working
on for the future, which I


16
0:1:0,4 --> 0:1:3,68
personally find very, very
interesting in many aspects.


17
0:1:3,68 --> 0:1:7,98
So what this is, this is what
we call an actuator.


18
0:1:7,98 --> 0:1:9,78
It's a Free Valve actuator.


19
0:1:9,78 --> 0:1:13,48
Most of you who are familiar
with combustion engines and


20
0:1:13,48 --> 0:1:16,4
especially car engines know
that there are camshafts


21
0:1:16,4 --> 0:1:22,45
involved to move the valves
inside the cylinder head.


22
0:1:22,45 --> 0:1:25,5
And these valves, they have been
controlled by camshafts


23
0:1:25,5 --> 0:1:28,6
for the last 150 years or
something like that.


24
0:1:28,6 --> 0:1:31,2
But it's very restrictive,
really, especially if you have


25
0:1:31,2 --> 0:1:34,74
multi-cylinders and you want
to have a rev range to go


26
0:1:34,74 --> 0:1:39,5
through with efficiency and
power because, when you have a


27
0:1:39,5 --> 0:1:41,93
camshaft, you basically look
at all the cylinders in the


28
0:1:41,93 --> 0:1:44,42
same line to do, pretty
much, the same thing.


29
0:1:44,42 --> 0:1:47,7
There are coming systems now
which give some flexibility.


30
0:1:47,7 --> 0:1:49,96
You can tweak the angle a little
bit, compared to the


31
0:1:49,96 --> 0:1:51,49
crank of the engine.


32
0:1:51,49 --> 0:1:53,77
And you can slide them sideways,
like Audi is doing


33
0:1:53,77 --> 0:1:55,4
to shut off cylinders now.


34
0:1:55,4 --> 0:1:57,25
So it's getting better and
better, but it's still very,


35
0:1:57,25 --> 0:1:58,37
very restrictive.


36
0:1:58,37 --> 0:2:1,9
You can think of the camshaft
like a broom, pretty much.


37
0:2:1,9 --> 0:2:2,84
You hold it in your hands and
you push all the valves


38
0:2:2,84 --> 0:2:5,45
simultaneously with
this broomstick.


39
0:2:5,45 --> 0:2:8,309
What the Free Valve system
does is that each valve


40
0:2:8,309 --> 0:2:9,31
becomes individual.


41
0:2:9,31 --> 0:2:12,43
So if you think of the valves
like keys on the piano,


42
0:2:12,43 --> 0:2:15,72
suddenly, instead of pushing all
the keys at the same time


43
0:2:15,72 --> 0:2:19,16
with a broomstick, you can
actually play the keys with


44
0:2:19,16 --> 0:2:22,27
your fingers, which is
the Free Valve idea.


45
0:2:22,27 --> 0:2:24,77
And then, of course, the
engine can perform in a


46
0:2:24,77 --> 0:2:27,96
completely different way than
being forced into a preset


47
0:2:27,96 --> 0:2:30,2
pattern of combustion.


48
0:2:30,2 --> 0:2:32,49
So what we're going to show
you here is this is like a


49
0:2:32,49 --> 0:2:35,22
small cut out of a
cylinder head.


50
0:2:35,22 --> 0:2:36,79
Here we have one valve.


51
0:2:36,79 --> 0:2:39,87
Normally, there are two intake
valves and two exhaust valves.


52
0:2:39,87 --> 0:2:43,9
And here is just a small
rig to run one of


53
0:2:43,9 --> 0:2:44,69
these Free Valve actuators.


54
0:2:44,69 --> 0:2:46,35
So basically, here you
have the valve.


55
0:2:46,35 --> 0:2:46,94
Here you have the actuator.


56
0:2:46,94 --> 0:2:48,7
It goes into it like this.


57
0:2:48,7 --> 0:2:52,76
This is lubricated by engine
oil and pressurized by


58
0:2:52,76 --> 0:2:55,15
pressurized air, which acts
like an air hammer


59
0:2:55,15 --> 0:2:56,82
to move this out.


60
0:2:56,82 --> 0:3:0,39
Then the engine oil makes sure
it stays stable and can lock


61
0:3:0,39 --> 0:3:1,87
it in different positions.


62
0:3:1,87 --> 0:3:6,41
And then air spring or a metal
spring pushes it back.


63
0:3:6,41 --> 0:3:9,99
So we have individual control
over each valve, which brings


64
0:3:9,99 --> 0:3:12,88
great benefit to the combustion


65
0:3:12,88 --> 0:3:15,3
cycles in the engine.


66
0:3:15,3 --> 0:3:16,71
So it's actually a snowballing
effect.


67
0:3:16,71 --> 0:3:20,22
The engine becomes lighter,
smaller, cheaper, cleaner.


68
0:3:20,22 --> 0:3:22,1
It can change the look of
the car in the end.


69
0:3:22,1 --> 0:3:24,53
So it's a very, very interesting
technology that


70
0:3:24,53 --> 0:3:27,66
I'm sure, one way or the
other, will conquer the


71
0:3:27,66 --> 0:3:29,84
cylinder heads of the world.


72
0:3:29,84 --> 0:3:32,85
So here we'll go into a little
bit of details how it works.


73
0:3:32,85 --> 0:3:35,25
Urban, who is partly responsible
for this


74
0:3:35,25 --> 0:3:39,675
development, will show you a
little bit what it looks like.


75
0:3:39,675 --> 0:3:42,5
URBAN CARLSON: It's a very
simple control system.


76
0:3:42,5 --> 0:3:47,202
We have one signal
for each valve.


77
0:3:47,202 --> 0:3:50,59
And when we tell it to open,
it opens with a few


78
0:3:50,59 --> 0:3:51,825
milliseconds delay.


79
0:3:51,825 --> 0:3:55,655
And when we tell it to close,
it closes with, again, a few


80
0:3:55,655 --> 0:3:57,245
milliseconds delay.


81
0:3:57,245 --> 0:4:0,79
This it can do at very
high speeds, up to


82
0:4:0,79 --> 0:4:3,132
20,000 RPM, if necessary.


83
0:4:3,132 --> 0:4:4,92
CHRISTIAN VON KOENIGSEGG: The
same size of actuator is


84
0:4:4,92 --> 0:4:8,3
actually good for a small
motorcycle engine revving


85
0:4:8,3 --> 0:4:13,79
15,000 RPM and a truck engine
revving 2,500 RPM.


86
0:4:13,79 --> 0:4:17,149
Because the motorcycle valve is
very light, so it takes the


87
0:4:17,149 --> 0:4:19,24
same energy to drive it
backwards and forwards at


88
0:4:19,24 --> 0:4:23,17
15,000 RPM as it takes to drive
a huge, heavy truck


89
0:4:23,17 --> 0:4:26,38
valve backwards and forwards
at 2,500 RPM.


90
0:4:26,38 --> 0:4:29,56
So it's very neat that the same
actuator basically covers


91
0:4:29,56 --> 0:4:32,805
the need for all different
engine sizes.


92
0:4:32,805 --> 0:4:34,705
So now we're running at
what kind of RPM here?


93
0:4:34,705 --> 0:4:38,505
URBAN CARLSON: Well, here's
a little bit over idle.


94
0:4:38,505 --> 0:4:39,76
CHRISTIAN VON KOENIGSEGG:
This is actually the


95
0:4:39,76 --> 0:4:41,95
movement of the valve.


96
0:4:41,95 --> 0:4:43,94
So you can see it
goes quickly up.


97
0:4:43,94 --> 0:4:45,395
And then it stays flat.


98
0:4:45,395 --> 0:4:47,412
It's like having a square
camshaft profile to make the


99
0:4:47,412 --> 0:4:49,28
engine breathe really well.


100
0:4:49,28 --> 0:4:51,94
If you would have a square
camshaft profile, it would


101
0:4:51,94 --> 0:4:55,365
break immediately, because it
would jump off the edges and


102
0:4:55,365 --> 0:4:57,78
would start hitting
the valve stem.


103
0:4:57,78 --> 0:4:58,75
And it wouldn't work.


104
0:4:58,75 --> 0:5:1,23
But with the Free Valve system,
you can actually open


105
0:5:1,23 --> 0:5:4,86
any way you like and open really
fast, stay open flat,


106
0:5:4,86 --> 0:5:5,84
and then drop down.


107
0:5:5,84 --> 0:5:8,191
Here it's possible to see the
valve sequence as well.


108
0:5:8,191 --> 0:5:10,576
That is a smooth curve, so it
doesn't hit the valve so you


109
0:5:10,576 --> 0:5:11,826
create noise and wear.


110
0:5:11,826 --> 0:5:17,61



111
0:5:17,61 --> 0:5:21,228
URBAN CARLSON: This
is 3,000 RPM.


112
0:5:21,228 --> 0:5:27,355
And you can see still a square
form of the valve curve.


113
0:5:27,355 --> 0:5:34,16



114
0:5:34,16 --> 0:5:46,84
This is 9,000 RPM.


115
0:5:46,84 --> 0:5:49,62
CHRISTIAN VON KOENIGSEGG: So
this might just look like an


116
0:5:49,62 --> 0:5:51,2
old Saab to you all.


117
0:5:51,2 --> 0:5:55,8
And in fact, it is, apart
from one aspect.


118
0:5:55,8 --> 0:5:58,8



119
0:5:58,8 --> 0:6:0,37
That aspect is what you
see that's red here.


120
0:6:0,37 --> 0:6:3,2
And that's the cylinder head,
which has been modified to


121
0:6:3,2 --> 0:6:7,99
accommodate our Cargine
Free Valve system.


122
0:6:7,99 --> 0:6:11,39
So basically what we've done
here is we've taken the


123
0:6:11,39 --> 0:6:14,38
cylinder head apart, machined
out all the mountings and so


124
0:6:14,38 --> 0:6:19,37
on for the camshafts, and
installed 16 Cargine Free


125
0:6:19,37 --> 0:6:21,1
Valve actuators.


126
0:6:21,1 --> 0:6:24,62
And then we have designed
a special valve cover.


127
0:6:24,62 --> 0:6:26,135
Or it's not really
a valve cover.


128
0:6:26,135 --> 0:6:31,2
It's more a lid containing
pressurized air channels and


129
0:6:31,2 --> 0:6:32,86
pressurized oil channels
coming from


130
0:6:32,86 --> 0:6:35,8
the engine oil side.


131
0:6:35,8 --> 0:6:38,5
You can see the height of
this black cover here.


132
0:6:38,5 --> 0:6:39,89
That's the same height as
the standard cylinder


133
0:6:39,89 --> 0:6:41,1
head used to be.


134
0:6:41,1 --> 0:6:44,9
So even when we retrofit it,
when it's not optimized for


135
0:6:44,9 --> 0:6:48,305
space, it's anyway lower than
the standard cylinder head.


136
0:6:48,305 --> 0:6:50,82
So the engine actually shrinks
and becomes lighter.


137
0:6:50,82 --> 0:6:53,48
If we would have made a cylinder
head from scratch,


138
0:6:53,48 --> 0:6:56,62
instead of retrofitting into an
existing cylinder head, it


139
0:6:56,62 --> 0:6:59,8
would also become much narrower
and even lower.


140
0:6:59,8 --> 0:7:3,53
And this whole section here,
which is a cover for where the


141
0:7:3,53 --> 0:7:5,83
chain drive and for the camshaft
used to sit, would


142
0:7:5,83 --> 0:7:7,2
disappear completely.


143
0:7:7,2 --> 0:7:9,71
So the engine would also
become a lot shorter.


144
0:7:9,71 --> 0:7:13,24
Basically, when you go from
a camshaft to Cargine Free


145
0:7:13,24 --> 0:7:17,34
Valves, the size of a
four-cylinder engine becomes


146
0:7:17,34 --> 0:7:19,14
just a little bit bigger
than the size of a


147
0:7:19,14 --> 0:7:20,55
three-cylinder engine.


148
0:7:20,55 --> 0:7:25,2
And then, of course, if you
cut away one cylinder to


149
0:7:25,2 --> 0:7:28,33
maintain the power and torque
level you used to have in your


150
0:7:28,33 --> 0:7:32,24
four-cylinder engine, then it
becomes really much smaller.


151
0:7:32,24 --> 0:7:35,84
So this car here has been
running with Cargine Free


152
0:7:35,84 --> 0:7:38,45
Valve system, winter
and summer, for the


153
0:7:38,45 --> 0:7:40,3
last 2 and 1/2 years.


154
0:7:40,3 --> 0:7:44,485
We've accumulated almost 60,000
kilometers, without any


155
0:7:44,485 --> 0:7:48,18
failure whatsoever to the
Free Valve system.


156
0:7:48,18 --> 0:7:50,8
It's just been upgraded with
our latest generation,


157
0:7:50,8 --> 0:7:55,58
actuator generation 5, on both
the intake an exhaust side of


158
0:7:55,58 --> 0:7:56,145
the engine.


159
0:7:56,145 --> 0:8:0,32
And it's been tested at the
testing institute, called AVL,


160
0:8:0,32 --> 0:8:7,92
with up to 20% improvement in
fuel efficiency so far.


161
0:8:7,92 --> 0:8:9,67
And that's just the starting
point, I would say.


162
0:8:9,67 --> 0:8:13,32
This is more a test field to
run for durability and for


163
0:8:13,32 --> 0:8:16,6
cold starts, even in the winter,
down to minus 20


164
0:8:16,6 --> 0:8:17,1
degrees Celsius.


165
0:8:17,1 --> 0:8:18,92
But it's really exciting.


166
0:8:18,92 --> 0:8:22,829
And it's, I think, one of the
few cars in the world that is


167
0:8:22,829 --> 0:8:25,91
running with no camshaft
whatsoever.


168
0:8:25,91 --> 0:8:30,76
When it's fully optimized, we're
expecting to have 30%


169
0:8:30,76 --> 0:8:35,9
less fuel consumption, 30%
more torque, and 30% more


170
0:8:35,9 --> 0:8:36,95
power, and, in an
average driving


171
0:8:36,95 --> 0:8:40,39
cycle, 50% less emissions.


172
0:8:40,39 --> 0:8:43,289
And that's without connecting
it to the possibility, which


173
0:8:43,289 --> 0:8:46,9
is very interesting, which
is an air tank.


174
0:8:46,9 --> 0:8:49,86
Given this valve technology, we
can actually recoup energy


175
0:8:49,86 --> 0:8:55,33
while engine braking, by using
the engine as an air pump,


176
0:8:55,33 --> 0:8:59,28
pumping up a tank with air,
getting air pressure there,


177
0:8:59,28 --> 0:9:3,88
and then driving off only on
that air, using the engine as


178
0:9:3,88 --> 0:9:7,45
a compressor or, let's
say, an air engine.


179
0:9:7,45 --> 0:9:10,58
That compressed air can also
be used for boosting the


180
0:9:10,58 --> 0:9:16,43
engine while using fuel to
have a really big, quick


181
0:9:16,43 --> 0:9:19,41
spooling turbo which
consumes no energy.


182
0:9:19,41 --> 0:9:22,76
So instead of storing energy
in the battery and like a


183
0:9:22,76 --> 0:9:24,74
battery, we're using an
empty tank of air.


184
0:9:24,74 --> 0:9:26,7
So that's the next step
of this technology.


185
0:9:26,7 --> 0:9:29,18
But already, without that, it's
a huge benefit, compared


186
0:9:29,18 --> 0:9:31,41
to normal camshafts.


187
0:9:31,41 --> 0:9:34,6
This technology is not
yet in Koenigsegg.


188
0:9:34,6 --> 0:9:35,79
And it's something, of
course, we might plan


189
0:9:35,79 --> 0:9:36,45
to do for the future.


190
0:9:36,45 --> 0:9:40,21
It will be another three, four
years out, before it's in any


191
0:9:40,21 --> 0:9:41,1
production car.


192
0:9:41,1 --> 0:9:43,21
And hopefully, the Koenigsegg
could be one of the first.


193
0:9:43,21 --> 0:11:43,21
