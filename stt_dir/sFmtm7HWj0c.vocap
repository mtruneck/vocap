###33 MALE SPEAKER 1: Mahalo.
###34 
###42 ERICH WEISS: My name's Erich Weiss, and I was--
###46 am--
###47 the director of the documentary Hori
###49 Smoku Sailor Jerry.
###51 It's a documentary about the life and times of Sailor Jerry
###54 Collins, who is a infamous tattoo artist who was based in
###59 Honolulu, Hawaii from the late '20s to when he died in 1973.
###65 I think during the movie, my image of Hawaii kind of
###68 changed and shifted.
###70 Because I'm from the East Coast.
###71 I'm from Philadelphia, so Hawaii really is
###74 another world away.
###75 And when you think of Hawaii you think of hula girls, and
###79 pig roasts, and that kind of thing.
###82 And researching for the film, I learned about where Jerry
###86 tattooed, and that was Hotel Street, which
###88 is Chinatown area.
###90 And it's always been notorious, because that's
###93 where soldiers and sailors would go to drink, meet a
###98 lady, usually a lady for hire, and get tattooed.
###104 And I listened to stories about how seedy and dirty and
###107 dangerous that area was.
###109 And I was attracted to that.

###137 ERICH WEISS: Mahalo.
###138 That's Mike Malone.
###139 MALE SPEAKER 2: [LAUGHING]
###141 ERICH WEISS: Kandy Everitt.
###142 MALE SPEAKER 2: [LAUGHING]
###143 MALE SPEAKER 3: Damn.
###144 
###146 ERICH WEISS: There's a lot of people that are still here
###148 that were tattooed by Sailor Jerry.
###150 And you could find people that worked in Jerry's shop just
###155 after when Mike Malone took it over, and it was
###157 called China Sea then.
###159 So there are continuous lines of history that you can follow
###162 and people that remember what Hotel Street was like and what
###166 that era represented.
###169 There's Mike Brown, who's still working here.
###173 Around the '70s, I think that's when Chinatown started
###176 to really go on its decline.
###178 And Mike Brown worked at China Sea during that time period,
###181 and now he's working in Waikiki.
###183 
###190 MIKE BROWN: Oh yeah.
###190 We're Skin Deep Tattoo in the heart of Waikiki, right next
###196 to the Tiffany Building.
###200 Majority of our tattoos here are done on tourists.
###205 MIKE BROWN: Plumerias, hibiscus, turtles, koi fish.
###210 
###213 We do have guys that come in and want a traditional-style
###217 tattooing, and I can do it, no problem.
###221 Because that's what I started out doing was
###223 that style of work.
###224 So I have no problem with that.
###228 I grew up in suburbs of Los Angeles, a little town called
###233 Pico Rivera.
###234 Yeah, most of the people I hung out with had tattoos.
###237 All the older guys did, peacocks, like this.
###241 I think the peacock was the most-used image at that time
###245 in the late '60s.
###247 I think that the old junkies used to do it to hide their
###250 needle marks.
###250 That was the whole significance of it.
###252 They'd get it, the body here, and then the tail would come
###255 down there.
###257 And this arm was a little bit of my recreational drug abuse
###264 caused me to have surgery on my arms.
###269 Kids love it.
###271 Well, I was not doing real good in California.
###275 I was--
###277 
###278 oh, I guess everybody knows.
###280 I was a drug addict, and I needed to get away from the
###283 drugs that were there.
###284 So I came here and got away from those drugs and soon
###288 found other drugs here.
###289 But I would go through downtown on my way to Waikiki,
###294 and I'd look down the street to see if the shop was open.
###298 And it was never open, because at that time, Mike Malone was
###301 in the process of opening the shop after Sailor Jerry died.
###306 He had died in June, and I moved here in the
###308 beginning of August.
###310 So it still had the Sailor Jerry sign out front.
###314 So one day I walked into the--
###315 I noticed the shop was open.
###316 And I walked in and met Mike.
###318 Well, that was the only tattoo scene that was going on here
###321 at that time in '73.
###323 So I just started coming around the shop.
###325 And then from there, we started hanging out together,
###328 because back in the old days, in the '70s, there weren't a
###331 lot of haoles here, or white people.
###333 We were definitely the minority at that time, and so
###339 if you met somebody that was a haole, and you were a haole,
###341 you sort of became friends with them if you wanted to
###344 have friendship.
###345 Because the locals really didn't take to us that good in
###348 those days.
###350 They were real hesitant, because all the stigma of
###353 Captain Cook, and from then on how they raped and pillaged
###357 the island.
###360 Before I started to tattooing, came over here in '73, and I
###364 liked to eat sweets, always have.
###366 So I decided, well, maybe I'll be a baker.
###368 So I went to baking school for a while.
###371 Then Malone set me up in a doughnut shop across the
###374 street from the tattoo shop to plug up the business for the
###379 other Filipino guy used to work.
###381 I pursued baking for another few years, and then come 1977,
###386 I was through with it.
###388 And I told Malone, teach me how to tattoo.
###391 If I could see something, I could copy it, but I wasn't
###395 always real good at making stuff up out of my head.
###398 I've always had trouble with that.
###403 
###407 MIKE BROWN: Lance McClain, Kandi Everett, Mike Malone,
###410 and myself, and that was it.
###412 Oh, Mike would be real friendly on some days and real
###416 grumpy on other days.
###418 It would just depend on how it was going for him that day.
###421 
###428 MIKE BROWN: Well, real clean, real bright, Sailor Jerry's
###431 designs, most of it.
###433 And then Mike had painted up a lot of his designs too.
###436 But for some reason, we sold a lot of the Sailor Jerry
###441 bulldogs and eagles.
###443 It just seemed like the '70s, everybody wanted
###445 bulldogs and eagles.
###448 That was mainly what all I did back then.
###451 But we did mostly Marines and Navy on military paydays.
###457 Back then they got paid every two weeks by cash.
###460 It was just production shop on military payday.
###462 We'd do 10-15 people on a 12-hour shift, and you
###468 couldn't do any body work in there when you
###470 had a military payday.
###472 All you did was backs and arms.
###474 Back then, if you tattooed 3% to 5% of the population, you
###478 were probably being very liberal.
###481 It seemed like nobody got tattooed back then.
###484 I'd get on the bus, and I had this big dragon my arm.
###487 And little Chinese ladies wouldn't even sit by me.
###490 They were afraid of me.
###491 I went to the first tattoo convention in Reno, Nevada.
###496 It was before National Tattoo Association started.
###499 So I went over there with Mike.
###501 He had just finished my back piece and wanted me to enter
###506 it in a contest.
###507 Went to the convention, and I saw that tattooing was
###510 starting to get really good.
###513 And you could make a decent living at it.
###516 Back then, there was only people that were in the tattoo
###519 business were the only people that came through
###521 the door, it seemed.
###523 Nobody made very much money, because everybody was gambling
###526 that weekend.
###528 So it wasn't a real good idea to have a tattoo convention in
###531 a place where they have gambling, I don't think.
###534 Oh, Thom Devita was there.
###537 Huck Spaulding was there.
###540 And then Ed Hardy, and Mike Malone, and I, and--
###544 that's right.
###544 Jack Rudy was there, and Charlie Cartwright.
###548 He was a character.
###549 That's where Ed and Mike met Jack Rudy and saw the work he
###554 was doing and were just blown away by that single-needle
###557 work he was doing.
###559 Oh, yeah.
###559 We were doing four- and five-needle outline tattoos,
###562 bright colors.
###563 They were doing all single-needle, black and gray,
###567 using a shade or two.
###568 But it was all just black and gray, real fine, more
###571 realistic than what we were doing.
###574 Yeah, I moved back to the mainland in 1979.
###579 I thought I could get a real job for a while and realized
###583 it wasn't for me.
###584 So I went right back to tattooing and started working
###587 for Ed Hardy at Tattooland in East LA, the one that looks
###593 like a little gingerbread house, yeah.
###596 Oh, there it was strictly tattooing gang bangers.
###599 That's all we did was just tattoo gang
###602 bangers, day and night.
###603 They didn't mind.
###604 They liked-- we were one of the only shops.
###608 Freddy Negrete, he was the only one that was--
###611 he grew up in the barrio.
###613 He was a gang banger too at one time.
###615 And he was from South San Gabriel--
###620 or no, San Gabriel, excuse me.
###622 I say South San Gabriel, he'd get mad.
###625 He was from San Gabriel, or Sangra, they called it.
###628 They'd get girls' heads, peacocks, roses, and names.
###634 Do a lot of names there.
###636 I could do a decent script name when I worked for Malone.
###640 And then afterwards, with Jack Rudy and Freddy Negrete, I had
###643 to learn how to letter better if I
###645 wanted to get more business.
###646 So I studied their style of lettering, and Jack would show
###652 me stuff, and so would Freddy.
###653 And from there, I sort of developed my
###657 own style, I guess.
