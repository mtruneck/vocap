1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:8,449



2
0:0:8,449 --> 0:0:11,9
TREVOR KUNK: I knew walking in
here, I knew even before I got


3
0:0:11,9 --> 0:0:12,51
here, that I wanted to
be at Blue Hill.


4
0:0:12,51 --> 0:0:15,36
There wasn't anywhere else
that I wanted to be.


5
0:0:15,36 --> 0:0:18,3
If I came here to eat with my
parents, just because they


6
0:0:18,3 --> 0:0:19,87
were visiting from Florida, they
were like, well, where


7
0:0:19,87 --> 0:0:20,42
should we go eat?


8
0:0:20,42 --> 0:0:21,86
I was like there's this place
called Blue Hill.


9
0:0:21,86 --> 0:0:22,96
And I want to try it.


10
0:0:22,96 --> 0:0:24,36
I want to go so bad.


11
0:0:24,36 --> 0:0:25,23
We came.


12
0:0:25,23 --> 0:0:29,9
I can remember exactly where I
sat, where my mother and my


13
0:0:29,9 --> 0:0:32,17
father sat, at what table, and
just had a mind-blowing meal.


14
0:0:32,17 --> 0:0:33,2
It's exciting.


15
0:0:33,2 --> 0:0:34,78
It's alive.


16
0:0:34,78 --> 0:0:37,59
So at that point is when
I knew that I had to


17
0:0:37,59 --> 0:0:38,84
come here and work.


18
0:0:38,84 --> 0:0:50,15



19
0:0:50,15 --> 0:0:51,1
My name's Trevor Kunk.


20
0:0:51,1 --> 0:0:52,819
I'm a Chef de Cuisine at
Blue Hill New York


21
0:0:52,819 --> 0:0:54,69
in Greenwich Village.


22
0:0:54,69 --> 0:0:57,56



23
0:0:57,56 --> 0:1:0,33
Farm to table is kind of
loosely used right now.


24
0:1:0,33 --> 0:1:1,93
If it's a seasonal restaurant.


25
0:1:1,93 --> 0:1:3,65
But it's more of a
micro-seasonal.


26
0:1:3,65 --> 0:1:6,76
When we say seasonal, it's
truly seasonal with the


27
0:1:6,76 --> 0:1:8,54
vegetables that we're serving
here, the fruit that we're


28
0:1:8,54 --> 0:1:10,97
serving, with the meat,
with the fish.


29
0:1:10,97 --> 0:1:14,65
And that window of usage is
anywhere from, let's say, two


30
0:1:14,65 --> 0:1:17,36
weeks to three months.


31
0:1:17,36 --> 0:1:19,65
There isn't really any dish
that's on the menu year round.


32
0:1:19,65 --> 0:1:22,37
That somebody could come here in
January and then come back


33
0:1:22,37 --> 0:1:25,53
in June and say, you know what,
I was here in January, I


34
0:1:25,53 --> 0:1:27,5
really want that salt-baked
rutabaga.


35
0:1:27,5 --> 0:1:29,97
They're not going to have it
when they're coming in June.


36
0:1:29,97 --> 0:1:32,63
So what we have here is a gill
feather rutabaga, though this


37
0:1:32,63 --> 0:1:35,69
is salt dough made
with compost.


38
0:1:35,69 --> 0:1:38,93
The initial idea behind this was
the way of taking a salt


39
0:1:38,93 --> 0:1:42,13
crust and cooking something
inside.


40
0:1:42,13 --> 0:1:45,25
Why can't we use the compost
to bake with?


41
0:1:45,25 --> 0:1:46,83
A little bit of hay as well.


42
0:1:46,83 --> 0:1:49,74
The hay does lend a little bit
of flavor, a little earthiness


43
0:1:49,74 --> 0:1:51,19
to the rutabaga.


44
0:1:51,19 --> 0:1:53,68
We just played with the recipe
a little bit and essentially


45
0:1:53,68 --> 0:1:56,48
developed a way to use
the salt crust.


46
0:1:56,48 --> 0:1:59,79
Kind of an earthy depth that
the rutabaga already has.


47
0:1:59,79 --> 0:2:2,18
But it just kind of helps
develop it a little bit more,


48
0:2:2,18 --> 0:2:5,14
and it wakes it up
a little bit.


49
0:2:5,14 --> 0:2:8,9
What we found is we work
incredibly hard to source the


50
0:2:8,9 --> 0:2:9,63
best ingredients possible.


51
0:2:9,63 --> 0:2:11,55
And we look everywhere.


52
0:2:11,55 --> 0:2:15,99
We were looking for a great
source of venison, and we


53
0:2:15,99 --> 0:2:17,65
found it with Halloran Farm.


54
0:2:17,65 --> 0:2:19,91
We actually made a road
trip up there.


55
0:2:19,91 --> 0:2:22,91
They proposed to us that they
would farm the venison for us


56
0:2:22,91 --> 0:2:23,86
exclusively.


57
0:2:23,86 --> 0:2:25,65
We hopped on it right away.


58
0:2:25,65 --> 0:2:27,53
And it is truly the
best venison that


59
0:2:27,53 --> 0:2:28,732
you will ever taste.


60
0:2:28,732 --> 0:2:30,392
-Oh my God.


61
0:2:30,392 --> 0:2:31,26
-It's so good.


62
0:2:31,26 --> 0:2:33,59
TREVOR KUNK: I think what
initially drew me to Blue Hill


63
0:2:33,59 --> 0:2:37,11
was at that point the local
seasonal idea was just


64
0:2:37,11 --> 0:2:38,38
starting to take off.


65
0:2:38,38 --> 0:2:41,27
And there wasn't anybody that
was doing it like Blue Hill


66
0:2:41,27 --> 0:2:43,11
was doing, and what
Dan was doing.


67
0:2:43,11 --> 0:2:46,23
Blue Hill New York was started
by Dan and David Barber.


68
0:2:46,23 --> 0:2:49,2
I don't know if Dan ever knew
that it was going to


69
0:2:49,2 --> 0:2:49,99
take off like this.


70
0:2:49,99 --> 0:2:51,53
I don't know if he knew
it was going to


71
0:2:51,53 --> 0:2:52,875
grow in this direction.


72
0:2:52,875 --> 0:2:57,0
RUBY DUKE: Almost two years
ago, Trevor got


73
0:2:57,0 --> 0:2:58,32
in touch with us.


74
0:2:58,32 --> 0:3:1,785
And he had heard that we were
raising whey-fed pigs.


75
0:3:1,785 --> 0:3:4,755
Basically, we work with
only three chefs.


76
0:3:4,755 --> 0:3:8,22
Trevor is one of them and
really, he supports our farm.


77
0:3:8,22 --> 0:3:10,7
Really makes it possible
for our farm to exist.


78
0:3:10,7 --> 0:3:14,6
-Very, very fatty, but
well-marbled kobe as well.


79
0:3:14,6 --> 0:3:17,6
TREVOR KUNK: We're cooking
for the ingredient.


80
0:3:17,6 --> 0:3:19,83
We prepare it simply in the way
that their ingredient is


81
0:3:19,83 --> 0:3:24,81
going to be showcased, and
elevate that flavor.


82
0:3:24,81 --> 0:3:25,96
It's truly a passion.


83
0:3:25,96 --> 0:3:26,98
It's truly a family.


84
0:3:26,98 --> 0:3:27,96
Torch it here.


85
0:3:27,96 --> 0:3:29,34
And then when we pour
it, we'll pour it


86
0:3:29,34 --> 0:3:31,12
over here on the table.


87
0:3:31,12 --> 0:3:34,27
So Katie Bell was a service
director here.


88
0:3:34,27 --> 0:3:35,91
She's also, I guess, a cocktail


89
0:3:35,91 --> 0:3:39,27
maker, or cocktail creator.


90
0:3:39,27 --> 0:3:40,96
Kenny Hogue is sous chef here.


91
0:3:40,96 --> 0:3:43,4
He's been here for about a
year and a half or so.


92
0:3:43,4 --> 0:3:46,74
So we left Blue Hill
about 9 o'clock.


93
0:3:46,74 --> 0:3:48,27
First of all, it's going
to be actually our


94
0:3:48,27 --> 0:3:49,37
first time out together--


95
0:3:49,37 --> 0:3:49,62
KATIE BELL: Yeah.


96
0:3:49,62 --> 0:3:51,67
TREVOR KUNK: --for
a meal, ever.


97
0:3:51,67 --> 0:3:53,46
So that's very, very exciting.


98
0:3:53,46 --> 0:3:56,12
We're going to Gwynnett Street
in Williamsburg, because


99
0:3:56,12 --> 0:3:58,24
there's Owen and Justin.


100
0:3:58,24 --> 0:3:59,68
KATIE BELL: Living in Brooklyn,
I obviously have a


101
0:3:59,68 --> 0:4:1,78
little bit of a different
perspective.


102
0:4:1,78 --> 0:4:6,91
But I think Brooklyn gets such
a rap for good food, but


103
0:4:6,91 --> 0:4:10,58
absolutely lack of service, and
just snooty attitudes, and


104
0:4:10,58 --> 0:4:11,97
all this sort of stuff.


105
0:4:11,97 --> 0:4:15,2
I think there's incredible food
being made in Brooklyn--


106
0:4:15,2 --> 0:4:16,31
absolutely gorgeous food.


107
0:4:16,31 --> 0:4:18,57
And then also the knowledge
to back it up and really


108
0:4:18,57 --> 0:4:19,82
beautiful service.


109
0:4:19,82 --> 0:4:23,34



110
0:4:23,34 --> 0:4:25,82
TREVOR KUNK: What happens here
in Blue Hill is the people


111
0:4:25,82 --> 0:4:28,4
that we bring on end up
becoming friends.


112
0:4:28,4 --> 0:4:29,59
They end up being family.


113
0:4:29,59 --> 0:4:32,54
So once they do move on from
Blue Hill, they'll go to


114
0:4:32,54 --> 0:4:33,372
another restaurant.


115
0:4:33,372 --> 0:4:34,758
OWEN CLARK: Hey, what's up?


116
0:4:34,758 --> 0:4:38,25
TREVOR KUNK: Went to go visit
Owen, as well as Justin who's


117
0:4:38,25 --> 0:4:39,67
the chef at Gwynnett.


118
0:4:39,67 --> 0:4:41,21
JUSTIN HILBERT: You don't
want to be on TV?


119
0:4:41,21 --> 0:4:45,597
You get ladies when
you're on TV, bro.


120
0:4:45,597 --> 0:4:48,46
TREVOR KUNK: It's amazing for
us to be able to go visit


121
0:4:48,46 --> 0:4:51,325
them, the new location, see how
they're doing, taste the


122
0:4:51,325 --> 0:4:52,43
food that they're cooking.


123
0:4:52,43 --> 0:4:52,98
All right, cheers.


124
0:4:52,98 --> 0:4:53,74
KATIE BELL: Cheers!


125
0:4:53,74 --> 0:4:54,33
First night out.


126
0:4:54,33 --> 0:4:55,863
TREVOR KUNK: First
night out ever.


127
0:4:55,863 --> 0:4:57,81
KATIE BELL: Took a year.


128
0:4:57,81 --> 0:5:0,37
TREVOR KUNK: One of the
staples, whisky bread.


129
0:5:0,37 --> 0:5:1,99
So I think they bake
it to order, right?


130
0:5:1,99 --> 0:5:2,75
KATIE BELL: Yeah.


131
0:5:2,75 --> 0:5:5,5
TREVOR KUNK: It takes like 10-12
minutes to come out.


132
0:5:5,5 --> 0:5:6,255
It's really delicious.


133
0:5:6,255 --> 0:5:11,47



134
0:5:11,47 --> 0:5:12,16
TREVOR KUNK: Beautiful.


135
0:5:12,16 --> 0:5:13,66
KENNY HOGUE: Nice.


136
0:5:13,66 --> 0:5:14,185
TREVOR KUNK: All looks
incredible.


137
0:5:14,185 --> 0:5:15,53
KENNY HOGUE: Yeah, it does.


138
0:5:15,53 --> 0:5:18,95
JUSTIN HILBERT: I guess it's
modern American cuisine.


139
0:5:18,95 --> 0:5:21,92
It's in par with fine-dining
food, but it's much more


140
0:5:21,92 --> 0:5:24,206
relaxed so there's no pretension
involved or


141
0:5:24,206 --> 0:5:24,876
anything like that.


142
0:5:24,876 --> 0:5:25,848
You can wear whatever
you want.


143
0:5:25,848 --> 0:5:28,764
You just go in and have a good
time and enjoy your meal.


144
0:5:28,764 --> 0:5:31,52
We're just trying to do our own
thing for the most part.


145
0:5:31,52 --> 0:5:34,39
TREVOR KUNK: Food-wise, I would
say the highlights for


146
0:5:34,39 --> 0:5:37,91
me were the egg dish with the
squid, which was mind-blowing.


147
0:5:37,91 --> 0:5:40,81
JUSTIN HILBERT: Take squid, you
char it on the flat top.


148
0:5:40,81 --> 0:5:43,45
Slice it really thin and that
gets sauteed with celery root


149
0:5:43,45 --> 0:5:44,81
that we make noodles out of.


150
0:5:44,81 --> 0:5:47,9
So the eggs have been poached
slowly for about an hour.


151
0:5:47,9 --> 0:5:50,33
And then this is
sea salt that's


152
0:5:50,33 --> 0:5:52,11
mixed with smoked paprika.


153
0:5:52,11 --> 0:5:53,455
Just gives it a little spice.


154
0:5:53,455 --> 0:5:54,76
That's it, man.


155
0:5:54,76 --> 0:5:56,27
TREVOR KUNK: There was a little
bit of heat, there was


156
0:5:56,27 --> 0:5:57,67
definitely the salt,
there was the acid.


157
0:5:57,67 --> 0:6:0,82
It was like it was warm, it was
welcoming, it was what I


158
0:6:0,82 --> 0:6:1,32
think we needed.


159
0:6:1,32 --> 0:6:4,69
We had a pretty hectic day
yesterday, so Katie, Kenny and


160
0:6:4,69 --> 0:6:6,84
I didn't really have a chance to
eat that much, which was I


161
0:6:6,84 --> 0:6:8,573
think in the end a
very good thing.


162
0:6:8,573 --> 0:6:9,5
What's the--


163
0:6:9,5 --> 0:6:10,41
dried lime?


164
0:6:10,41 --> 0:6:11,99
KENNY HOGUE: Yeah, it's like
a hint of lime in there.


165
0:6:11,99 --> 0:6:14,286
It just looks like
shaved lime zest.


166
0:6:14,286 --> 0:6:15,72
TREVOR KUNK: I will
taste things and


167
0:6:15,72 --> 0:6:17,25
we'll learn from it.


168
0:6:17,25 --> 0:6:20,44
With the egg that we had
tonight, there's definitely


169
0:6:20,44 --> 0:6:23,1
some kind of preserved lime--


170
0:6:23,1 --> 0:6:23,81
something to that.


171
0:6:23,81 --> 0:6:26,32
Weather it's dried lemon grass
or dried lime leaves, that's


172
0:6:26,32 --> 0:6:27,78
something that we'll probably
try to figure out


173
0:6:27,78 --> 0:6:28,61
how they did it.


174
0:6:28,61 --> 0:6:29,265
It's amazing.


175
0:6:29,265 --> 0:6:30,63
It wakes your pallet up.


176
0:6:30,63 --> 0:6:32,3
And it's a wakening.


177
0:6:32,3 --> 0:6:33,77
KENNY HOGUE: Since we are open
seven days a week, whatever


178
0:6:33,77 --> 0:6:36,99
one of the cooks gets a day off
to go eat, everyone's like


179
0:6:36,99 --> 0:6:37,67
where'd you go eat?


180
0:6:37,67 --> 0:6:38,2
Where'd you go?


181
0:6:38,2 --> 0:6:39,255
Tell us about it.


182
0:6:39,255 --> 0:6:39,68
TREVOR KUNK: Right.


183
0:6:39,68 --> 0:6:43,12
JUSTIN HILBERT: Thought you
might like some dessert.


184
0:6:43,12 --> 0:6:44,916
TREVOR KUNK: All right.


185
0:6:44,916 --> 0:6:45,69
KENNY HOGUE: Thank you.


186
0:6:45,69 --> 0:6:46,86
TREVOR KUNK: Thank you
for everything.


187
0:6:46,86 --> 0:6:50,41
Well I think with Justin,
having the experience of


188
0:6:50,41 --> 0:6:53,1
working in a pastry department,
whether inside a


189
0:6:53,1 --> 0:6:55,87
wd-50 or any restaurant,
working in the pasty


190
0:6:55,87 --> 0:6:57,71
department is incredibly
important.


191
0:6:57,71 --> 0:7:1,32
You're not only learning
technique, we you're also


192
0:7:1,32 --> 0:7:4,21
learning how to think outside
the box a little bit.


193
0:7:4,21 --> 0:7:7,69
KATIE BELL: They're really into
the savory and sweet.


194
0:7:7,69 --> 0:7:10,5
TREVOR KUNK: And I think with
Justin, he's taken that


195
0:7:10,5 --> 0:7:14,24
experience and not only
developed that technique of


196
0:7:14,24 --> 0:7:17,6
the sweet side, but it also
lends to the savory side.


197
0:7:17,6 --> 0:7:22,7
Comes with the ability to be
able to have some sweetness in


198
0:7:22,7 --> 0:7:25,68
a savory dish, but not have it
be overpowering, but lend


199
0:7:25,68 --> 0:7:28,586
itself to a duck that we
ate last night with the


200
0:7:28,586 --> 0:7:30,47
lingonberry jam.


201
0:7:30,47 --> 0:7:34,68
Yes, it was sweet, but it went
very well with that succulent,


202
0:7:34,68 --> 0:7:36,35
savory duck breast.


203
0:7:36,35 --> 0:7:38,74
And it comes to the plating,
it comes with the flavors.


204
0:7:38,74 --> 0:7:41,1
We thought it was to
mind-blowing as well, egg yolk


205
0:7:41,1 --> 0:7:43,84
encasing the cod.


206
0:7:43,84 --> 0:7:48,325
We had a pretty phenomenal
meal.


207
0:7:48,325 --> 0:7:49,84
OWEN CLARK: Where are
we off to, Eunice?


208
0:7:49,84 --> 0:7:53,464
KENNY HOGUE: I think next
is Mother's Ruin.


209
0:7:53,464 --> 0:7:55,824
OWEN CLARK: Where
is this place?


210
0:7:55,824 --> 0:7:57,64
TREVOR KUNK: I guess
like NoLIta area.


211
0:7:57,64 --> 0:7:58,71
OWEN CLARK: It's weird.


212
0:7:58,71 --> 0:8:0,29
Living in this neighborhood and
working over here all the


213
0:8:0,29 --> 0:8:3,316
time, it is so nice to not
be in Williamsburg


214
0:8:3,316 --> 0:8:4,81
for a little while.


215
0:8:4,81 --> 0:8:7,754
That's the same skinny
jeans dufus.


216
0:8:7,754 --> 0:8:9,113
It's like hey, what's up?


217
0:8:9,113 --> 0:8:10,612
TREVOR KUNK: Dude, I'm
wearing skinny jeans.


218
0:8:10,612 --> 0:8:13,44



219
0:8:13,44 --> 0:8:15,52
So after we left Gwynnett
Street we


220
0:8:15,52 --> 0:8:19,154
went to Mother's Ruin.


221
0:8:19,154 --> 0:8:22,66
And walking in, I don't want to
call it a neighborhood bar,


222
0:8:22,66 --> 0:8:24,5
because I don't think it
really is, ultimately.


223
0:8:24,5 --> 0:8:26,83
But it was kind of like
walking into home.


224
0:8:26,83 --> 0:8:27,67
Everybody was very friendly.


225
0:8:27,67 --> 0:8:30,9
And everybody that was there
was excited to be there.


226
0:8:30,9 --> 0:8:31,886
And you could tell that they had
been there before and they


227
0:8:31,886 --> 0:8:33,159
want you to come back again.


228
0:8:33,159 --> 0:8:36,309
It was like an instant party.


229
0:8:36,309 --> 0:8:37,584
TJ came over with the Amaro.


230
0:8:37,584 --> 0:8:39,89
A couple of Amaro shots.


231
0:8:39,89 --> 0:8:40,57
Cheers, everyone.


232
0:8:40,57 --> 0:8:43,45
TJ LYNCH: All right,
happy Tuesday.


233
0:8:43,45 --> 0:8:44,295
Salute.


234
0:8:44,295 --> 0:8:46,531



235
0:8:46,531 --> 0:8:48,56
TREVOR KUNK: The cocktails
were great.


236
0:8:48,56 --> 0:8:50,526
TJ told us the little
story having to do


237
0:8:50,526 --> 0:8:53,33
with the slushie machine.


238
0:8:53,33 --> 0:8:55,49
It began as a gift. and now
they're selling it.


239
0:8:55,49 --> 0:8:58,9
They're like OK, we'll take
your slushy machine.


240
0:8:58,9 --> 0:8:59,69
We'll see what we
can do with it.


241
0:8:59,69 --> 0:9:0,63
Left it on the bar.


242
0:9:0,63 --> 0:9:1,89
Started playing with
different ideas.


243
0:9:1,89 --> 0:9:5,25
And slowly developed into the
whiskey slushie that we had


244
0:9:5,25 --> 0:9:7,41
last night, which
was delicious.


245
0:9:7,41 --> 0:9:11,702
Whiskey, they had like some
fall, aromatic spices as well.


246
0:9:11,702 --> 0:9:14,528
We're going back to Blue
Hill for family meal.


247
0:9:14,528 --> 0:9:15,0
OWEN CLARK: Nice.


248
0:9:15,0 --> 0:9:17,244
TREVOR KUNK: And we want you to
come if you can swing it.


249
0:9:17,244 --> 0:9:18,6
TJ LYNCH: Yeah, cheers, guys.


250
0:9:18,6 --> 0:9:19,85
TREVOR KUNK: All
right, cheers.


251
0:9:19,85 --> 0:9:28,808



252
0:9:28,808 --> 0:9:30,266
TJ LYNCH: It's nice when
I get out of there.


253
0:9:30,266 --> 0:9:31,724
TREVOR KUNK: Yeah?


254
0:9:31,724 --> 0:9:34,64
[INAUDIBLE].


255
0:9:34,64 --> 0:9:37,28
TREVOR KUNK: The new
addition is TJ.


256
0:9:37,28 --> 0:9:38,51
The other TJ, yes.


257
0:9:38,51 --> 0:9:42,38
And actually, I'm a TJ as
well, born and raised.


258
0:9:42,38 --> 0:9:44,5
But when I came to New York,
I became Trevor.


259
0:9:44,5 --> 0:9:45,38
TJ LYNCH: We're going to go
for family meal, huh?


260
0:9:45,38 --> 0:9:46,12
TREVOR KUNK: We are.


261
0:9:46,12 --> 0:9:47,8
TJ LYNCH: Very exciting.


262
0:9:47,8 --> 0:9:47,465
TREVOR KUNK: Special.


263
0:9:47,465 --> 0:9:48,62
TJ LYNCH: Tacos.


264
0:9:48,62 --> 0:9:51,228
TREVOR KUNK: Yeah, like Penny
said, taco Sunday on Tuesday.


265
0:9:51,228 --> 0:9:54,63



266
0:9:54,63 --> 0:9:57,55
Hello!


267
0:9:57,55 --> 0:10:2,8
So we came back to Blue Hill
and cooked what we like to


268
0:10:2,8 --> 0:10:3,53
call a family meal.


269
0:10:3,53 --> 0:10:6,73
So it was kind of our taco
Sunday that we do every Sunday


270
0:10:6,73 --> 0:10:10,37
for our staff, but elevated
to times 20.


271
0:10:10,37 --> 0:10:13,202
Michelle, our wine director,
opened up a double magnum of


272
0:10:13,202 --> 0:10:15,99
champagne, so we were able to
share that as we got back.


273
0:10:15,99 --> 0:10:19,17
In the kitchen I cooked what was
essentially like a braised


274
0:10:19,17 --> 0:10:22,42
pig head that we had diced and
pressed, and then just fried


275
0:10:22,42 --> 0:10:24,47
off in the black pans.


276
0:10:24,47 --> 0:10:26,655
So it's a pig head.


277
0:10:26,655 --> 0:10:31,13
We cooked it in a [INAUDIBLE],
then finished with raw


278
0:10:31,13 --> 0:10:35,56
shallots, pickled shallots,
lots of chopped herbs.


279
0:10:35,56 --> 0:10:37,39
Now the idea is that it's going
to start popping, it's


280
0:10:37,39 --> 0:10:38,84
going to start rendering.


281
0:10:38,84 --> 0:10:40,2
All the fat's going
to come out.


282
0:10:40,2 --> 0:10:41,78
All the protein's going
to get crispy.


283
0:10:41,78 --> 0:10:46,25
Kind of like a sisig, the
Filipino traditional dish.


284
0:10:46,25 --> 0:10:49,55
There's something in that realm
of the world that I


285
0:10:49,55 --> 0:10:51,514
guess I really like when
I'm not working.


286
0:10:51,514 --> 0:10:54,24



287
0:10:54,24 --> 0:10:56,828
KENNY HOGUE: Everybody
contributed.


288
0:10:56,828 --> 0:11:0,8
TREVOR KUNK: Francine Lee who
works in our pastry department


289
0:11:0,8 --> 0:11:1,71
here was born and
raised in Korea.


290
0:11:1,71 --> 0:11:5,49
So she'll make a kimchi and
bring it in for us to share


291
0:11:5,49 --> 0:11:6,78
with the family.


292
0:11:6,78 --> 0:11:10,37
Alfredo who's was one of our
prep cooks here, is from


293
0:11:10,37 --> 0:11:11,23
Mexico originally.


294
0:11:11,23 --> 0:11:13,99
And his mother is a very, very
good cook, especially when it


295
0:11:13,99 --> 0:11:15,13
comes to her mole.


296
0:11:15,13 --> 0:11:18,32
So I think the rotation's
like once a month or


297
0:11:18,32 --> 0:11:19,32
so she'll make mole.


298
0:11:19,32 --> 0:11:21,97
She'll freeze it and then she'll
ship it to Alfredo.


299
0:11:21,97 --> 0:11:24,55
So Alfredo actually came in on
his day off yesterday to cook


300
0:11:24,55 --> 0:11:26,32
that for us and to
share it with us.


301
0:11:26,32 --> 0:11:29,49



302
0:11:29,49 --> 0:11:31,466
Here we go.


303
0:11:31,466 --> 0:11:34,7
Haskell, you're next
buddy, let's go.


304
0:11:34,7 --> 0:11:36,3
Come on.


305
0:11:36,3 --> 0:11:38,25
The kind of amazing thing with
Haskell is, is he's been


306
0:11:38,25 --> 0:11:40,46
eating here since he
was a small child.


307
0:11:40,46 --> 0:11:42,23
But he used to come in like
once or twice a year.


308
0:11:42,23 --> 0:11:43,215
He would come in with his mom.


309
0:11:43,215 --> 0:11:44,91
He was just very passionate
about food


310
0:11:44,91 --> 0:11:46,36
and loved Blue Hill.


311
0:11:46,36 --> 0:11:49,32
So over the years, after all
those meals, he decided to go


312
0:11:49,32 --> 0:11:51,47
to a special school here in
New York, kind of like a


313
0:11:51,47 --> 0:11:54,4
technical school slash
culinary school.


314
0:11:54,4 --> 0:11:56,23
After finishing that,
he's like I want to


315
0:11:56,23 --> 0:11:56,89
intern at Blue Hill.


316
0:11:56,89 --> 0:11:58,73
That's where I want to be.


317
0:11:58,73 --> 0:12:1,47
It reflects on what we
do for our guests.


318
0:12:1,47 --> 0:12:3,57
We cook our hearts out for them,
and we want to serve


319
0:12:3,57 --> 0:12:5,8
them the best food possible.


320
0:12:5,8 --> 0:12:9,2
But we also have found that the
staff that's serving them,


321
0:12:9,2 --> 0:12:11,54
our family, is incredibly
important as well.


322
0:12:11,54 --> 0:12:16,22
And to keep them the happiest
is to feed them well.


323
0:12:16,22 --> 0:12:18,67
It just makes people happy and
it makes people excited.


324
0:12:18,67 --> 0:14:18,67
