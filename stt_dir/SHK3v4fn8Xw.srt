1
0:0:3,113 --> 0:0:9,853
(Host) I think people are more
involved in scarcity-driven concerns.


2
0:0:9,853 --> 0:0:12,594
- Yes
- You know, more than ever!


3
0:0:12,594 --> 0:0:16,138
And abundance is the way to eliminate that.
- Well, right, right.


4
0:0:16,138 --> 0:0:18,311
- Not only an abundance
in resources


5
0:0:18,311 --> 0:0:23,676
but also knowledge: how
to use that abundance.


6
0:0:23,676 --> 0:0:27,4
If you just produce an abundance
and distribute that to people


7
0:0:27,4 --> 0:0:32,315
you'll [have] mass hedonism: a
total collapse of the society.


8
0:0:32,315 --> 0:0:35,496
You must educate people
to live with that.


9
0:0:35,496 --> 0:0:37,944
In other words, you
have to tell people


10
0:0:37,944 --> 0:0:41,239
even during instruction, [for
example] learning to fly an airplane:


11
0:0:41,239 --> 0:0:44,48
what you can't do, what your
landing speed has to be.


12
0:0:44,48 --> 0:0:48,92
If you don't have a certain speed
you will not rise off the ground.


13
0:0:48,92 --> 0:0:53,159
If you don't maintain the speed in landing,
your craft will fall to the ground.


14
0:0:53,159 --> 0:0:58,189
These are laws, physical laws,
and we must become aware


15
0:0:58,189 --> 0:1:4,6
of the physical laws that affect human
behavior, our values, our lifestyle.


16
0:1:4,6 --> 0:1:8,184
- (Jacque) ...rates, going up like
that and the amount of people needed


17
0:1:8,184 --> 0:1:10,687
to turn out a given
amount of products.


18
0:1:10,687 --> 0:1:15,591
It's always less people and higher
products, do you follow me?


19
0:1:15,591 --> 0:1:20,52
[J. Rifkin] said: "When
production hits this,


20
0:1:20,52 --> 0:1:23,0
and the amount of people
required hits that,


21
0:1:23,0 --> 0:1:25,46
when they cross, that's
the end of the system."


22
0:1:25,46 --> 0:1:27,896
Has nothing to do with
good men, bad men


23
0:1:27,896 --> 0:1:31,108
politics, corruption,
fascism, free enterprise.


24
0:1:31,108 --> 0:1:34,765
All of these discussions
about communism, socialism,


25
0:1:34,765 --> 0:1:40,211
free enterprise, fascism, become
irrelevant in a society of an abundance


26
0:1:40,211 --> 0:1:43,661
where people have access to things.
All those things fade out:


27
0:1:43,661 --> 0:1:46,667
labor unions, you just
don't need that anymore.


28
0:1:46,667 --> 0:1:49,5
It just does not exist.


29
0:1:49,5 --> 0:1:54,877
- (Host) [In a] truly free society we
would not have things like protectionism


30
0:1:54,877 --> 0:1:57,53
and nationalism and things like that.
- (Jacque) OK.


31
0:1:57,53 --> 0:2:0,466
If abundance existed
all over the world,


32
0:2:0,466 --> 0:2:4,0
all the water you want, all the
food, growing all over the place,


33
0:2:4,0 --> 0:2:6,102
no one would stake
out territories.


34
0:2:6,102 --> 0:2:9,7
You stake out territories
because it promotes survival.


35
0:2:9,7 --> 0:2:12,962
People living on a desert can only
have a tribe of a certain size


36
0:2:12,962 --> 0:2:17,218
because that desert region can't
support more than 50 people.


37
0:2:17,218 --> 0:2:22,98
You have wandering nomads that
wander with the animal migration,


38
0:2:22,98 --> 0:2:26,147
so if there's scarcity and new
people come into that area,


39
0:2:26,147 --> 0:2:29,0
they say "You're moving
in on my territory!"


40
0:2:29,0 --> 0:2:32,139
You know a lot of vegetarians
actually believe


41
0:2:32,139 --> 0:2:38,288
that vegetarianism produces more
amiable patterns of behavior.


42
0:2:38,288 --> 0:2:40,389
Actually, that's not true.


43
0:2:40,389 --> 0:2:43,22
Cows in the field have
all the grass they want


44
0:2:43,22 --> 0:2:47,57
so they're not very aggressive.
Any place you walk there's grass to chew on.


45
0:2:47,57 --> 0:2:49,735
They're not aggressive because
there's an abundance;


46
0:2:49,735 --> 0:2:52,856
whereas herbivorous
animals, carnivores,


47
0:2:52,856 --> 0:2:54,844
don't have as much abundance.


48
0:2:54,844 --> 0:2:57,803
They have to run after
animals and hunt them down,


49
0:2:57,803 --> 0:3:1,574
and sometimes you don't make it.
You're not always in great physical shape,


50
0:3:1,574 --> 0:3:4,139
so they have to be
more aggressive.


51
0:3:4,139 --> 0:3:6,897
They have to be more
aggressive to survive.


52
0:3:6,897 --> 0:3:10,443
It's the scarcity of food
that generates that.


53
0:3:10,443 --> 0:3:14,459
Hunger generates the hunt
for food, for animals.


54
0:3:14,459 --> 0:3:19,924
If you didn't had pains of hunger,
it wouldn't be that [way].


55
0:3:19,924 --> 0:3:22,765
Years ago, primitive societies


56
0:3:22,765 --> 0:3:26,648
used soldiers to keep
people in line, or police.


57
0:3:26,648 --> 0:3:30,298
Some inventor came up to the
old landowner and he said:


58
0:3:30,298 --> 0:3:32,518
"I've got a cheaper
way of doing that,


59
0:3:32,518 --> 0:3:35,423
that wouldn't require
as many soldiers."


60
0:3:35,423 --> 0:3:38,573
The landowner said "What way is that?
" He said "Well,


61
0:3:38,573 --> 0:3:42,838
I can project fire from my mouth;
I have several things I can do


62
0:3:42,838 --> 0:3:48,217
and people would look at me in amazement
and then listen to what I say."


63
0:3:48,217 --> 0:3:50,546
He says "I come from
The One-On-High


64
0:3:50,546 --> 0:3:53,66
and that One-On-High can see you


65
0:3:53,66 --> 0:3:56,977
through a mud wall ten feet
thick, no matter what you do.


66
0:3:56,977 --> 0:4:0,907
If you take anything that doesn't
belong to you, he can see that.


67
0:4:0,907 --> 0:4:3,718
After you kick the bucket
you're gonna burn eternally."


68
0:4:3,718 --> 0:4:6,558
That was a method for
keeping people to behave


69
0:4:6,558 --> 0:4:9,24
though the king can kill
anybody he didn't like:


70
0:4:9,24 --> 0:4:13,485
"Behead that son-of-a-bitch" or "get rid of
that culture over there." They all did it;


71
0:4:13,485 --> 0:4:17,49
but "Thou shall not kill"
was in that community,


72
0:4:17,49 --> 0:4:20,525
and a wife being
obedient made it easier


73
0:4:20,525 --> 0:4:23,859
for otherwise women would
protest their state of being.


74
0:4:23,859 --> 0:4:28,47
They had to pledge obedience to
the old man, whatever he wanted,


75
0:4:28,47 --> 0:4:31,415
so the old man got his way.
If a man worked for somebody


76
0:4:31,415 --> 0:4:34,533
he was not to remove anything
that didn't belong to him.


77
0:4:34,533 --> 0:4:36,532
Stealing was a crime,


78
0:4:36,532 --> 0:4:41,62
so the man who conducted magic and did all
the magic, controlled a lot of people.


79
0:4:41,62 --> 0:4:44,952
He was the priest in the
early days, the soothsayer.


80
0:4:44,952 --> 0:4:48,355
Now the priest was bothered
continuously by people.


81
0:4:48,355 --> 0:4:51,435
[They'd] come up and [say] "My
son doesn't listen to me."


82
0:4:51,435 --> 0:4:55,269
"My daughter is disobedient"
and he said: "Well..."


83
0:4:55,269 --> 0:4:59,124
He was so bothered by people
that he made a stone statue.


84
0:4:59,124 --> 0:5:2,469
He said "Anytime you have any
problem drop a half a buck off here


85
0:5:2,469 --> 0:5:6,746
and talk to the stone statue!
Tell him all the problems you've got."


86
0:5:6,746 --> 0:5:10,107
Some of them did that, but they
didn't like the conclusion,


87
0:5:10,107 --> 0:5:12,11
so they destroyed
the stone statue.


88
0:5:12,11 --> 0:5:15,592
He made two: one with a
smile and one with horns.


89
0:5:15,592 --> 0:5:19,92
He says "The bad one, you
yell at, spit on, all that


90
0:5:19,92 --> 0:5:21,562
and the good one you thank
for your state-of-being."


91
0:5:21,562 --> 0:5:25,532
These were forms, dead forms
made of clay or stone,


92
0:5:25,532 --> 0:5:29,57
and people talked to them all day long.
They didn't bother the priests at all.


93
0:5:29,57 --> 0:5:31,934
The priest was off somewhere
doing something else.


94
0:5:31,934 --> 0:5:35,429
This is how all these
icons came into being


95
0:5:35,429 --> 0:5:39,73
and all the laws and
all the contributions.


96
0:5:39,73 --> 0:5:43,903
Jesus walked on water, men
walk in space, on the Moon,


97
0:5:43,903 --> 0:5:49,398
so that aspect you can use;
but he was not a deity.


98
0:5:49,398 --> 0:5:52,965
He was not another
manifestation of God,


99
0:5:52,965 --> 0:5:55,78
nor were any of the
great teachers.


100
0:5:55,78 --> 0:5:59,315
Great teachers were great compared
to what was available at the time.


101
0:5:59,315 --> 0:6:3,834
The nearest thing to what you
would call 'honesty' is science,


102
0:6:3,834 --> 0:6:8,717
the nearest thing, because the system
itself checks things out constantly.


103
0:6:8,717 --> 0:6:11,675
You come up with an idea.
They put it to test,


104
0:6:11,675 --> 0:6:14,106
and more so than
any other system.


105
0:6:14,106 --> 0:6:19,139
Yes, technology makes mistakes,
buildings collapse, bridges fall;


106
0:6:19,139 --> 0:6:21,5
but compared to
any other system,


107
0:6:21,5 --> 0:6:24,734
it's by far the most
outstanding system,


108
0:6:24,734 --> 0:6:28,897
and the only system that we know
of that transports people around.


109
0:6:28,897 --> 0:6:33,218
Electrical power gives us refrigerators
to keep food in storage.


110
0:6:33,218 --> 0:6:35,661
In other words, science
and technology


111
0:6:35,661 --> 0:6:39,986
has given us and freed more
people from hard toil and labor


112
0:6:39,986 --> 0:6:43,562
than any philosopher
and do-gooder.


113
0:6:43,562 --> 0:6:48,872
Unfortunately, when people see Mother
Teresa going around helping people,


114
0:6:48,872 --> 0:6:53,476
they can't grasp some
agronomist working alone,


115
0:6:53,476 --> 0:6:56,723
increasing the agricultural
yield by five times,


116
0:6:56,723 --> 0:6:59,144
who has fed people who
could never of been fed


117
0:6:59,144 --> 0:7:2,94
that would have starved to death.
They can't grasp that!


118
0:7:2,94 --> 0:7:5,698
They have to see.
If you show normal people movies


119
0:7:5,698 --> 0:7:8,147
of thousands of children
with swollen bellies,


120
0:7:8,147 --> 0:7:11,342
suffering, they would get
a lump on their throat.


121
0:7:11,342 --> 0:7:13,94
If you want to raise
money: one child


122
0:7:13,94 --> 0:7:17,347
crippled, with crutches,
moving toward the camera


123
0:7:17,347 --> 0:7:21,486
and when he gets to the camera have
him look up and have a tear run down.


124
0:7:21,486 --> 0:7:24,973
You can raise more money than
showing 8 million people.


125
0:7:24,973 --> 0:7:29,89
They are pinheads!
They are conditioned to utter simplicity.


126
0:7:29,89 --> 0:7:34,638
This is not condemning the human race.
I'm condemning the value system,


127
0:7:34,638 --> 0:7:38,559
the indoctrinations that are given by
the institutions of higher learning.


128
0:7:38,559 --> 0:7:40,888
They are not institutions
of higher learning.


129
0:7:40,888 --> 0:7:44,525
They are detrimental in
developing human beings


130
0:7:44,525 --> 0:7:47,43
who are what you would
call conscience and aware


131
0:7:47,43 --> 0:7:49,954
of their surroundings
and other people.


132
0:7:49,954 --> 0:9:49,954
Subscribe- thanks!
