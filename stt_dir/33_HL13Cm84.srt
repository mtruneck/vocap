JESSE HUGHES: When you think
about rock and roll, and you


4
0:0:19,1 --> 0:0:21,87
think about the road, you're
thinking about a mystical,


5
0:0:21,87 --> 0:0:24,83
mythical place that seems like
everybody in the whole world


6
0:0:24,83 --> 0:0:26,47
dreams about being on,
but nobody really


7
0:0:26,47 --> 0:0:28,92
knows what it's about.


8
0:0:28,92 --> 0:0:29,95
Legalize it.

know what I'm saying?


10
0:0:31,67 --> 0:0:35,93



11
0:0:35,93 --> 0:0:39,25
Those who do go down that road
soon come to a realization at


12
0:0:39,25 --> 0:0:41,7
their life that it's the place
they always knew they should


13
0:0:41,7 --> 0:0:44,13
be, and the place they always
wanted to be, even


14
0:0:44,13 --> 0:0:45,22
before they knew it.

I believe the most thankless
element of the rock roadie


20
0:0:51,87 --> 0:0:54,26
must truly exist within
the metal world.


21

and the strip pole, and

that turning up to a

parade of '80s rockers wearing
a "Legalize Gay" shirt could


32

I learned with Billy Joel that
if the red cup was in the


192
0:6:26,26 --> 0:6:28,76
dressing room, that meant
Christie's not coming.


193
0:6:28,76 --> 0:6:29,62
Put booze in there.


194
0:6:29,62 --> 0:6:31,94
But if there was a blue cup,
that meant Christie's coming.

They're better be water
in every cup.


196
0:6:35,3 --> 0:6:37,7

FedEx his toilet


197
0:6:37,7 --> 0:6:38,52
seat ahead of time.


198
0:6:38,52 --> 0:6:41,8
And we would have to install his
toilet seat, so that when


199
0:6:41,8 --> 0:6:42,8
Luther came in, he would
sit on his toilet


200
0:6:42,8 --> 0:6:45,18
seat, and it was his.


201
0:6:45,18 --> 0:6:46,74

the cigarette going.


204
0:6:50,17 --> 0:6:51,38
I had to hand him both.


205
0:6:51,38 --> 0:6:53,38
I was a glorified waiter,
is what I was.


206
0:6:53,38 --> 0:6:56,1
But man, it was the best
cigarette I've ever lit.


207
0:6:56,1 --> 0:6:57,83
And it was the greatest drink
I've ever poured.


208
0:6:57,83 --> 0:6:59,21
And I did it every night.


209
0:6:59,21 --> 0:7:2,44
And I was looking forward to
that moment, because I knew I


210
0:7:2,44 --> 0:7:4,57
had made it through
another war day.


211
0:7:4,57 --> 0:7:7,12
And he didn't break a string,
and he wasn't giving me that


212
0:7:7,12 --> 0:7:10,19
dirty look, or he wasn't
screaming about this or that.


213
0:7:10,19 --> 0:7:11,8
It was awesome.


214
0:7:11,8 --> 0:7:12,44
He was just--


215
0:7:12,44 --> 0:7:13,43
it was great.


216
0:7:13,43 --> 0:7:16,0
JESSE HUGHES: So I want hear
this burger story.


217
0:7:16,0 --> 0:7:19,15
JEF HICKEY: I make it
across the border.


218
0:7:19,15 --> 0:7:20,1
I'm out of it.


219
0:7:20,1 --> 0:7:21,36
I've been up for three days.


220
0:7:21,36 --> 0:7:22,72
And I'm fucking hungry.


221
0:7:22,72 --> 0:7:23,73
And Phil--


222
0:7:23,73 --> 0:7:25,45
the guitar player from
Motorhead-- tells me that


223
0:7:25,45 --> 0:7:28,74
there's some burgers on the bus,
and I should go have one.


224
0:7:28,74 --> 0:7:32,82
So I go into the bus, and I grab
the burger off the plate,


225
0:7:32,82 --> 0:7:34,62
and everybody's looking at me.


226
0:7:34,62 --> 0:7:35,93
And it's just one of those
moments where you're like,


227
0:7:35,93 --> 0:7:37,55
wait, something's not right.


228
0:7:37,55 --> 0:7:41,19
I go to bite, and then I realize
it's a patty of shit.


229
0:7:41,19 --> 0:7:43,27
JESSE HUGHES: I personally have
seen people walk off the


230
0:7:43,27 --> 0:7:45,52
stage for far less.


231
0:7:45,52 --> 0:7:45,91
JEF HICKEY: Sure.


232
0:7:45,91 --> 0:7:47,66
I've had guitars broken
across my leg.


233
0:7:47,66 --> 0:7:49,25
I had an SG thrown at me.


234
0:7:49,25 --> 0:7:50,4
I've been hit with mic stands.


235
0:7:50,4 --> 0:7:51,87
I've been kicked.


236
0:7:51,87 --> 0:7:54,2
Yeah, I was just kinda caught
in the line of fire.


237
0:7:54,2 --> 0:7:55,51
I'm the guy.


238
0:7:55,51 --> 0:7:57,62
JESSE HUGHES: This is
a calling, almost.


239
0:7:57,62 --> 0:8:0,5
JEF HICKEY: Oh no, dude, I
would do anything for the


240
0:8:0,5 --> 0:8:1,22
show, dude.


241
0:8:1,22 --> 0:8:2,565
Anything for the show.


242
0:8:2,565 --> 0:8:5,27
Because every show that I went
to, some guy put it on.


243
0:8:5,27 --> 0:8:7,5
And that show changed my life.


244
0:8:7,5 --> 0:8:10,2
So I'm hoping that the show that
I helped put on changes


245
0:8:10,2 --> 0:8:11,28
some other kid's life.


246
0:8:11,28 --> 0:8:14,61
And then he's the next Lemmy, or
the next Josh, or the next


247
0:8:14,61 --> 0:8:16,35
Nick, or whoever.


248
0:8:16,35 --> 0:8:18,99
JESSE HUGHES: That sums
it up, right there.


249
0:8:18,99 --> 0:8:20,65
But would you recommend this?


250
0:8:20,65 --> 0:8:22,94
And if you would, who would you
recommend it to, and what


251
0:8:22,94 --> 0:8:23,74
would you recommend?


252
0:8:23,74 --> 0:8:25,3
JEF HICKEY: I'm not here to
tell anybody what to do,


253
0:8:25,3 --> 0:8:26,62
'cause I didn't want anybody
telling me what to do.


254
0:8:26,62 --> 0:8:29,51
But it's a lot of fun, man.


255
0:8:29,51 --> 0:8:31,9
It's a great fucking
existence.


256
0:8:31,9 --> 0:8:32,64
I got to some really
great shows.


257
0:8:32,64 --> 0:8:35,12
I got to meet a lot
of cool people.


258
0:8:35,12 --> 0:8:37,89
I got to fuck a lot of amazing
chicks that normally wouldn't


259
0:8:37,89 --> 0:8:39,63
even serve me dinner.


260
0:8:39,63 --> 0:8:40,73
So.


261
0:8:40,73 --> 0:8:42,679
JESSE HUGHES: Any regrets?


262
0:8:42,679 --> 0:8:43,51
JEF HICKEY: Uh, wow.


263
0:8:43,51 --> 0:8:44,76
Yeah, herpes.


264
0:8:44,76 --> 0:8:47,19



265
0:8:47,19 --> 0:8:48,44
Herpes.


266
0:8:48,44 --> 0:8:50,5



267
0:8:50,5 --> 0:8:51,9
That's it.


268
0:8:51,9 --> 0:8:53,97
JESSE HUGHES: There's a phrase
often said that if you can't


269
0:8:53,97 --> 0:8:56,12
do the crime, do not
do the time.


270
0:8:56,12 --> 0:8:58,61
Rock and roll is a beautiful
and amazing vicious animal,


271
0:8:58,61 --> 0:9:0,29
but it takes no prisoners,
and it will leave


272
0:9:0,29 --> 0:9:1,59
its mark upon you.


273
0:9:1,59 --> 0:9:3,55
It's definitely not for those
who want to lead the


274
0:9:3,55 --> 0:9:5,15
disciple's life of Christ.


275
0:9:5,15 --> 0:9:7,68
And it's certainly not for
people trying to save whales


276
0:9:7,68 --> 0:9:9,71
or stop global warming.


277
0:9:9,71 --> 0:9:12,59
In order to be alive in the
belly of the whale, you have


278
0:9:12,59 --> 0:9:14,36
to be just as mean.


279
0:9:14,36 --> 0:9:15,77
If not meaner.


280
0:9:15,77 --> 0:9:16,866
JEF HICKEY: that's--


281
0:9:16,866 --> 0:9:17,322
[LAUGHS]


282
0:9:17,322 --> 0:9:20,298
that feels fine.


283
0:9:20,298 --> 0:9:24,59
[LAUGHING/CRYING]


284
0:9:24,59 --> 0:9:26,61
I just really miss my
mom, right now.


285
0:9:26,61 --> 0:9:29,8
Simultaneously, just
coincidentally at the same


286
0:9:29,8 --> 0:9:31,286
time that this tattoo's
happening.


287
0:9:31,286 --> 0:9:33,2
You know, and I'm just
thinking about,


288
0:9:33,2 --> 0:9:34,27
like AIDS and cancer.


289
0:9:34,27 --> 0:9:35,81
Just makes me sad.


290
0:9:35,81 --> 0:9:37,6
[LAUGHTER]


291
0:9:37,6 --> 0:11:37,6
