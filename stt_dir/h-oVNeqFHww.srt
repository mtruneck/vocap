1
0:0:5,83 --> 0:0:12,9
Only one creature has carved a life
for itself in every habitat on Earth.


2
0:0:12,9 --> 0:0:17,17
That creature is us.


3
0:0:17,17 --> 0:0:24,55
All over the world we still use our
ingenuity to survive in the wild places,


4
0:0:24,55 --> 0:0:31,779
far from the city lights,
face to face with raw nature.


5
0:0:31,779 --> 0:0:48,799
This is the Human Planet.


6
0:0:48,799 --> 0:0:55,369
The jungle is nature at its most vigorous,
complex and mysterious.


7
0:0:55,369 --> 0:0:59,11
It may appear bountiful,


8
0:0:59,11 --> 0:1:10,83
but for humans, this is a surprisingly
hostile environment.


9
0:1:10,83 --> 0:1:22,42
Though, through history,
great civilisations have arisen here,


10
0:1:22,42 --> 0:1:31,27
none have stood the test of time.


11
0:1:31,27 --> 0:1:36,54
The jungle refuses to be tamed


12
0:1:36,54 --> 0:1:46,77
and it punishes those
who don't live by its laws.


13
0:1:46,77 --> 0:1:49,87
Yet even today, there are some
who guard the secrets


14
0:1:49,87 --> 0:1:52,45
of surviving in this wild world.


15
0:1:52,45 --> 0:1:55,28
These are the remarkable stories


16
0:1:55,28 --> 0:2:27,9
of the people who call
the rainforest home.


17
0:2:27,9 --> 0:2:32,63
Tropical rainforests coverjust
2% of the planet's surface...


18
0:2:32,63 --> 0:2:37,72
...but they're home to half
of all species on Earth.


19
0:2:37,72 --> 0:2:42,97
The problem is, much of this life
is in the tree-tops,


20
0:2:42,97 --> 0:2:56,36
a world way out of our reach.


21
0:2:56,36 --> 0:3:1,29
Exploiting the canopy's riches from
the forest floor is so challenging,


22
0:3:1,29 --> 0:3:3,34
getting enough protein
is a daily struggle.


23
0:3:3,34 --> 0:3:16,95
The 


24
0:3:16,95 --> 0:3:19,83
Matis of Brazil
are highly skilled hunters


25
0:3:19,83 --> 0:3:30,69
but for the past week there's been
barely enough meat to go round.


26
0:3:30,69 --> 0:3:42,459
Benin is hungry and he's determined
today's hunt will be more successful.


27
0:3:42,459 --> 0:3:47,959
Administering tree-frog toxin into
his bloodstream purges his body,


28
0:3:47,959 --> 0:4:0,0
preparing it for action.


29
0:4:0,0 --> 0:4:10,94
The 
Matis also drop a noxious
plant juice into their eyes


30
0:4:10,94 --> 0:4:20,209
to sharpen their senses
and focus their minds on the hunt.


31
0:4:20,209 --> 0:4:43,33
Benin and the others summon
the power of the animal spirits.


32
0:4:43,33 --> 0:4:45,389
Hunting canopy animals
from the ground


33
0:4:45,389 --> 0:4:47,569
requires formidable fire power...


34
0:4:47,569 --> 0:4:54,479
...a four-metre long blowpipe,


35
0:4:54,479 --> 0:5:11,99
precision-made to a design
honed over thousands 


36
0:5:11,99 --> 0:5:16,869
of years.


37
0:5:16,869 --> 0:5:20,369
Spotting animals in the dense
vegetation is so hard


38
0:5:20,369 --> 0:5:30,8
the Matis rely on hearing
to locate prey...


39
0:5:30,8 --> 0:5:37,819
...and use mimicry to lure them
into range.


40
0:5:37,819 --> 0:5:45,99
They can imitate all ten species of
monkey found in these forests.


41
0:5:45,99 --> 0:5:52,29
(IMITATES MONKEY CALL)


42
0:5:52,29 --> 0:5:56,59
(MONKEY CRIES)


43
0:5:56,59 --> 0:6:1,159
A howler monkey responds.


44
0:6:1,159 --> 0:6:17,889
30 metres up,
monkeys are feeding in a fig tree.


45
0:6:17,889 --> 0:6:20,589
Scoring the darts with piranha teeth


46
0:6:20,589 --> 0:6:24,809
ensures the poisoned tip breaks off
in the victim's body.


47
0:6:24,809 --> 0:6:31,8
Unlike guns, blowpipes are near silent


48
0:6:31,8 --> 0:6:38,9
and can be fired
without spooking the monkeys.


49
0:6:38,9 --> 0:6:43,999
Benin makes the first hit,
and now the monkeys scatter.


50
0:6:43,999 --> 0:6:49,669
Once shot, the monkeys
must be tracked


51
0:6:49,669 --> 0:6:56,36
as the curare-vine poison takes effect.


52
0:6:56,36 --> 0:7:2,289
This monkey's already weak,
but it's hiding, and must be flushed out.


53
0:7:2,289 --> 0:7:8,469
They shoot again.


54
0:7:8,469 --> 0:7:21,179
But it's stuck in a vine now, and
there's no choice but to go and get it.


55
0:7:21,179 --> 0:7:40,3
One down, but it's just the beginning.


56
0:7:40,3 --> 0:7:42,59
As one of the swiftest hunters,


57
0:7:42,59 --> 0:7:47,249
it's Benin's job to pick off
any escaping monkeys.


58
0:7:47,249 --> 0:8:3,979
He shoots another, but misses.


59
0:8:3,979 --> 0:8:12,5
Benin fires again, this time on target.


60
0:8:12,5 --> 0:8:19,629
The monkey finally stops...


61
0:8:19,629 --> 0:8:27,999
...and Benin takes aim one last time.


62
0:8:27,999 --> 0:8:38,36
Eight monkeys. It's been a good day.


63
0:8:38,36 --> 0:8:52,1
But all too often
they return empty-handed.


64
0:8:52,1 --> 0:8:54,97
Hunting in the canopy is so difficult,


65
0:8:54,97 --> 0:8:59,32
people must find most of their food
closer to the ground.


66
0:8:59,32 --> 0:9:6,28
But scratching a living
on the forest floor is hardly any easier.


67
0:9:6,28 --> 0:9:13,71
The complex nature of this mysterious
world is so hard to master,


68
0:9:13,71 --> 0:9:24,67
the lessons have to start early.


69
0:9:24,67 --> 0:9:29,1
Orlando's from the Piaroa tribe
of Venezuela.


70
0:9:29,1 --> 0:9:30,72
He's like any other kid,


71
0:9:30,72 --> 0:9:42,65
only life in the jungle has already
forced him to fend for himself.


72
0:9:42,65 --> 0:9:59,39
But this childhood adventure takes
them deep into the jungle underworld.


73
0:9:59,39 --> 0:10:3,1
As only 2% of sunlight
reaches the forest floor,


74
0:10:3,1 --> 0:10:12,88
surprisingly few plants grow
and this means few animals.


75
0:10:12,88 --> 0:10:16,99
There's less protein here
than in the desert...


76
0:10:16,99 --> 0:10:26,4
and much that is here is poisonous.


77
0:10:26,4 --> 0:10:39,94
Distinguishing dinner from danger
is an essential life skill.


78
0:10:39,94 --> 0:10:51,14
Few creatures have a more sinister
reputation than the one they seek.


79
0:10:51,14 --> 0:11:9,45
The goliath tarantula,
the size of a dinner plate,


80
0:11:9,45 --> 0:11:18,3
the largest spider in the world.


81
0:11:18,3 --> 0:11:21,81
It's hard to imagine
a less appetising meal,


82
0:11:21,81 --> 0:11:27,99
but picky eaters don't last long
in the jungle.


83
0:11:27,99 --> 0:11:34,2
Besides, Orlando says
they're delicious,


84
0:11:34,2 --> 0:11:44,17
and handling dangerous animals
comes with the territory.


85
0:11:44,17 --> 0:11:45,84
From about five years old,


86
0:11:45,84 --> 0:11:49,45
Piaroa children know exactly
where to hunt for spiders...


87
0:11:49,45 --> 0:12:1,13
...and in a couple of hours
can catch enough for a decent meal.


88
0:12:1,13 --> 0:12:7,9
But they have to be careful
of both the huge fangs


89
0:12:7,9 --> 0:12:17,62
and of the hairs they kick
towards any attacker.


90
0:12:17,62 --> 0:12:30,7
If they contact the skin or are inhaled,
they cause a nasty reaction.


91
0:12:30,7 --> 0:12:34,77
Orlando's come off worst.


92
0:12:34,77 --> 0:12:45,75
But growing up in the jungle,
he's used to a little discomfort.


93
0:12:45,75 --> 0:12:51,25
Tarantulas are best served toasted,
like marshmallows.


94
0:12:51,25 --> 0:12:58,38
All the hairs must be singed off
so they don't catch in the throat.


95
0:12:58,38 --> 0:13:0,9
And when they start squeaking,


96
0:13:0,9 --> 0:13:15,98
which is just air escaping from
the joints, they're almost done.


97
0:13:15,98 --> 0:13:18,7
Tarantulas taste a bit like crab


98
0:13:18,7 --> 0:13:33,1
and, with a little seasoning,
they go down a treat.


99
0:13:33,1 --> 0:13:34,63
Orlando's and his friends'survival


100
0:13:34,63 --> 0:13:51,61
depends upon embracing
every opportunity in the forest


101
0:13:51,61 --> 0:13:55,12
Jungle people rely so heavily
on their surroundings,


102
0:13:55,12 --> 0:13:58,46
they become a natural part
of the forest


103
0:13:58,46 --> 0:14:12,99
and form extraordinary bonds
with nature.


104
0:14:12,99 --> 0:14:17,61
Very few people live more intimately
with animals than the Awa Guaja


105
0:14:17,61 --> 0:14:23,13
of the eastern Amazon.


106
0:14:23,13 --> 0:14:27,23
Nurturing a wide range of creatures
from the forest,


107
0:14:27,23 --> 0:14:37,19
the Awa are obsessive pet keepers.


108
0:14:37,19 --> 0:14:44,72
And there are some animals
they cherish above any others.


109
0:14:44,72 --> 0:14:49,42
Like the Matis, hunting monkeys
is vital to the Awa's survival,


110
0:14:49,42 --> 0:14:52,82
providing nearly half their protein.


111
0:14:52,82 --> 0:16:52,82
But this relationship
provides far more than food.
