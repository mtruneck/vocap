SIMON OSTROVSKY: After spending
the night in Tel


4
0:0:16,62 --> 0:0:19,27
Aviv, it was time to head back
to the West Bank for a


5
0:0:19,27 --> 0:0:23,49
Palestinian protest, which was
only about 30 miles away, but


6
0:0:23,49 --> 0:0:26,76
things are never as easy
as they sound.


7
0:0:26,76 --> 0:0:29,79
In addition to all the usual
barriers between Israel and


8
0:0:29,79 --> 0:0:33,2
the Palestinian territories, the
heavens had conspired to


9
0:0:33,2 --> 0:0:37,63
shut down traffic across Tel
Aviv for the annual marathon.


10
0:0:37,63 --> 0:0:40,0
This was a celebration
of fitness that I


11
0:0:40,0 --> 0:0:41,25
hadn't prepared for.


12
0:0:41,25 --> 0:0:43,72



13
0:0:43,72 --> 0:0:45,91
It's Friday morning
in Tel Aviv.


14
0:0:45,91 --> 0:0:50,18
We're going to the West Bank
where it's Land Day, and all


15
0:0:50,18 --> 0:0:53,46
of Palestine celebrates
their land.


16
0:0:53,46 --> 0:0:56,4
But it's also an occasion when
they clash with Israeli


17
0:0:56,4 --> 0:0:59,21
troops, so we're going to see
what that vibe is like.


18
0:0:59,21 --> 0:1:1,88
We're having to carry all of
our stuff across the entire


19
0:1:1,88 --> 0:1:4,93
city, and frankly, it's
really pissing me off.


20
0:1:4,93 --> 0:1:8,23



21
0:1:8,23 --> 0:1:10,47
This is the Qalandia
checkpoint.


22
0:1:10,47 --> 0:1:13,6
There's tons of soldiers and
police here today because


23
0:1:13,6 --> 0:1:17,4
they're expecting a
confrontation with the


24
0:1:17,4 --> 0:1:19,24
Palestinian demonstrators.


25
0:1:19,24 --> 0:1:21,67
We're going across the
checkpoint while we can


26
0:1:21,67 --> 0:1:24,48
because once the trouble
starts, they're


27
0:1:24,48 --> 0:1:25,73
going to shut it down.


28
0:1:25,73 --> 0:1:30,66



29
0:1:30,66 --> 0:1:31,31
Oh, man.


30
0:1:31,31 --> 0:1:32,86
Not another one.


31
0:1:32,86 --> 0:1:34,11
You've got to be kidding me.


32
0:1:34,11 --> 0:1:38,9



33
0:1:38,9 --> 0:1:38,5
OK.


34
0:1:38,5 --> 0:1:41,13
Now I'm pretty sure
we're here.


35
0:1:41,13 --> 0:1:44,54
Three hours after we set out
from Tel Aviv, we were finally


36
0:1:44,54 --> 0:1:46,89
in the seat of the Palestinian
Authority--


37
0:1:46,89 --> 0:1:48,89
Ramallah.


38
0:1:48,89 --> 0:1:52,35
We met Tawfiq Haddad, a
Palestinian-American who'd


39
0:1:52,35 --> 0:1:54,45
agreed to take us on
a sporting event


40
0:1:54,45 --> 0:1:55,7
of a different kind.


41
0:1:55,7 --> 0:2:1,95



42
0:2:1,95 --> 0:2:5,31
Palestinians were marking Land
Day, an annual event that


43
0:2:5,31 --> 0:2:7,66
draws attention to the fact
that the territory they


44
0:2:7,66 --> 0:2:10,46
control keeps shrinking and
shrinking in inverse


45
0:2:10,46 --> 0:2:13,21
proportion to the amount of land
controlled by Israel and


46
0:2:13,21 --> 0:2:14,876
its settlers.


47
0:2:14,876 --> 0:2:17,241
JAMAL JUMA: Land [INAUDIBLE]
for the Palestinians


48
0:2:17,241 --> 0:2:18,19
[INAUDIBLE].


49
0:2:18,19 --> 0:2:20,45
When the Palestinian land has
been taken, Palestinians


50
0:2:20,45 --> 0:2:23,11
became refugees around the world
because the Zionists


51
0:2:23,11 --> 0:2:25,17
have been expelled them from
their land in '48.


52
0:2:25,17 --> 0:2:28,3
We are still, until now,
suffering from--


53
0:2:28,3 --> 0:2:29,38
in the diaspora--


54
0:2:29,38 --> 0:2:30,86
from this refugee problem.


55
0:2:30,86 --> 0:2:32,17
They want to keep their
occupation and


56
0:2:32,17 --> 0:2:33,62
colonization forever.


57
0:2:33,62 --> 0:2:34,52
This is not going to happen.


58
0:2:34,52 --> 0:2:36,29
SIMON OSTROVSKY: But their
politicians say they want to


59
0:2:36,29 --> 0:2:37,81
have a two-state solution.


60
0:2:37,81 --> 0:2:39,39
JAMAL JUMA: This is
lip services.


61
0:2:39,39 --> 0:2:41,41
If you really, as a politician,
want two-state


62
0:2:41,41 --> 0:2:43,47
solution, prove it
on the ground.


63
0:2:43,47 --> 0:2:44,67
Stop your settlements.


64
0:2:44,67 --> 0:2:46,77
Take out your settlers from the
West Bank and Jerusalem,


65
0:2:46,77 --> 0:2:49,462
and stop demolishing the
houses and the ethnic


66
0:2:49,462 --> 0:2:52,0
cleansing and confiscating
the land.


67
0:2:52,0 --> 0:2:53,48
Stop the wall that
you are building.


68
0:2:53,48 --> 0:2:56,36
Then we can believe that you
want two-state solution.

70
0:2:58,34 --> 0:3:5,381



71
0:3:5,381 --> 0:3:7,79
SIMON OSTROVSKY: The protests
were taking place at the


72
0:3:7,79 --> 0:3:11,12
Qalandia checkpoint that I'd
crossed through earlier.


73
0:3:11,12 --> 0:3:14,66
And Israel's security forces
were determined not to let any


74
0:3:14,66 --> 0:3:18,29
of the Palestinians near it.


75
0:3:18,29 --> 0:3:21,2
Meanwhile, a local cell phone
company decided that the


76
0:3:21,2 --> 0:3:24,31
madness erupting all around
was the perfect place to


77
0:3:24,31 --> 0:3:26,66
advertise its services.


78
0:3:26,66 --> 0:3:29,93
So the funny thing is while
this protest is going on,


79
0:3:29,93 --> 0:3:31,41
somebody's handing
out these hats.


80
0:3:31,41 --> 0:3:34,46
And what these actually are are
from the local cell phone


81
0:3:34,46 --> 0:3:38,2
company because apparently,
Palestinians never miss an


82
0:3:38,2 --> 0:3:39,95
opportunity to do some
direct marketing.


83
0:3:39,95 --> 0:3:42,6
MALE SPEAKER: What are they
fucking-- people are going to


84
0:3:42,6 --> 0:3:43,47
die today and they just
want them to be


85
0:3:43,47 --> 0:3:45,8
wearing the Jawwal hat?


86
0:3:45,8 --> 0:3:48,22



87
0:3:48,22 --> 0:3:51,28
Land Day demonstrations like
this one were taking place all


88
0:3:51,28 --> 0:3:54,41
around the West Bank and along
the borders of Israel and


89
0:3:54,41 --> 0:3:58,22
Syria-Lebanon and in Gaza, where
one of the protesters,


90
0:3:58,22 --> 0:4:1,1
just 20 years old, was shot
dead as he approached an


91
0:4:1,1 --> 0:4:2,88
Israeli crossing.


92
0:4:2,88 --> 0:4:5,85
But I'd heard that Palestinian
demonstrators weren't the only


93
0:4:5,85 --> 0:4:8,95
ones in the habit of throwing
stones, so I headed to an


94
0:4:8,95 --> 0:4:12,28
ordinary Palestinian town a bit
further away from all the


95
0:4:12,28 --> 0:4:14,64
commotion to hear their
side of the story.
