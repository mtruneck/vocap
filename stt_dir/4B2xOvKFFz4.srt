1
0:0:6,0 --> 0:0:10,1
In a world of 7 billion people


2
0:0:10,1 --> 0:0:14,2
who is most typical?


3
0:0:14,2 --> 0:0:20,5
The world's most typical person


4
0:0:20,5 --> 0:0:24,0
Is right handed


5
0:0:24,0 --> 0:0:27,5
Makes less than $12,000 a year


6
0:0:27,5 --> 0:0:30,5
Has a cell phone


7
0:0:30,5 --> 0:0:34,0
But not a bank account.


8
0:0:34,0 --> 0:0:37,75
Less than 25% of us do


9
0:0:37,75 --> 0:0:41,0
So what does he look like?


10
0:0:41,0 --> 0:0:44,0
The world's most typical person is male


11
0:0:44,0 --> 0:0:46,5
Males outnumber females


12
0:0:46,5 --> 0:0:51,0
but just barely


13
0:0:51,0 --> 0:0:55,25
The median age of the world's population is 28


14
0:0:55,25 --> 0:0:58,7
The largest ethnic group is Han Chinese


15
0:0:58,7 --> 0:1:1,0
Based on these traits 


16
0:1:1,0 --> 0:1:3,6
the world's most typical person is 


17
0:1:3,6 --> 0:1:9,0
a 28-year-old Han Chinese man


18
0:1:9,0 --> 0:1:12,5
There are over 9,000,000 of them


19
0:1:12,5 --> 0:1:15,5
Researchers averaged 190,00 


20
0:1:15,5 --> 0:1:17,75
of their photos


21
0:1:17,75 --> 0:1:26,2
to create a composite image


22
0:1:26,2 --> 0:1:30,5
This is the world's most typical person


23
0:1:30,5 --> 0:1:38,0
But he won't be typical for long


24
0:1:38,0 --> 0:1:41,75
By 2030 that person will come from India


25
0:1:41,75 --> 0:1:47,5
And typical is always relative


26
0:1:47,5 --> 0:1:50,2
The typical man in Holland is 5' 11"


27
0:1:50,2 --> 0:1:55,0
The typical man in Peru is 5' 4 1/2"


28
0:1:55,0 --> 0:2:0,0
In Japan, the typical woman lives nearly 86 years


29
0:2:0,0 --> 0:2:6,0
In Afghanistan, she lives 45 years


30
0:2:6,0 --> 0:2:9,5
The typical American uses 100 gallons of water 


31
0:2:9,5 --> 0:2:13,0
at home per day


32
0:2:13,0 --> 0:2:17,0
In parts of Ethiopia, it's 2.5 gallons


33
0:2:17,0 --> 0:2:23,25
And some women spend 8 hours/day collecting it


34
0:2:23,25 --> 0:2:29,0
Typical people have choices to make


35
0:2:29,0 --> 0:2:34,0
But they're not the same for everyone


36
0:2:34,0 --> 0:2:37,25
And our choices make a big difference


37
0:2:37,25 --> 0:2:41,0
When multiplied by 7 billion


38
0:2:41,0 --> 0:2:49,5
7 billion - The surprising face of the most typical human
