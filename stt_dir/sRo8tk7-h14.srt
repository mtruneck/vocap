ADRI MURGUIA: The following
morning, Faustino began making


3
0:0:31,13 --> 0:0:33,9
the last preparations before a
trip to the Green Lake, which


4
0:0:33,9 --> 0:0:36,9
is a day's horse ride away.


5
0:0:36,9 --> 0:0:37,34
We would spend the
night there.


6
0:0:37,34 --> 0:0:39,29
And so we needed to take enough
supplies to get us


7
0:0:39,29 --> 0:0:40,641
through our stay.


8
0:0:40,641 --> 0:0:43,53



9
0:0:43,53 --> 0:0:45,11
The Green Lake was the
first piece of land


10
0:0:45,11 --> 0:0:46,2
he owned out here.


11
0:0:46,2 --> 0:0:48,52
And it was also central to
his cattle business.


12
0:0:48,52 --> 0:0:51,8
He hadn't returned for
over four years, but


13
0:0:51,8 --> 0:0:53,76
we didn't know why.

20
0:1:56,954 --> 0:1:59,405
ADRI MURGUIA: Every inch of land
that we crossed over to


21
0:1:59,405 --> 0:2:1,96
get to the Green Lake
belongs to Faustino.


22
0:2:1,96 --> 0:2:3,85
It was a six hour journey.


23
0:2:3,85 --> 0:2:4,755
We were only halfway there.


24
0:2:4,755 --> 0:2:7,19
And the crew felt exhausted
by the attacks of the


25
0:2:7,19 --> 0:2:8,86
blood-sucking horseflies.


26
0:2:8,86 --> 0:2:11,55
But Faustino and Marcos were
unfazed, even by the


27
0:2:11,55 --> 0:2:14,633
blistering sun that barely
sets during the summer.

riding our horses, and
encountered Faustino's


32
0:2:55,83 --> 0:2:58,8
settlement that he had left
behind, we started


33
0:2:58,8 --> 0:2:59,16
setting up our camp.


34
0:2:59,16 --> 0:3:0,89
And Marcos began cooking
the lamb we had


35
0:3:0,89 --> 0:3:2,14
killed the day before.

I think Marcos is going to

0:5:23,86 --> 0:5:29,26
Faustino finishes
his time here.


75
0:5:29,26 --> 0:5:31,6
He's inheriting this
whole thing.


76
0:5:31,6 --> 0:5:33,53
He lives in O'Higgins
and he has a family.


77
0:5:33,53 --> 0:5:37,38
But he's planning on
bringing them here.


78
0:5:37,38 --> 0:5:38,88
I don't know, I don't think he's
trying to take advantage

0:5:38,88 --> 0:5:40,61
of him or anything.


80
0:5:40,61 --> 0:5:41,86

ADRI MURGUIA: After spending
the night, we gathered that


87
0:7:28,47 --> 0:7:31,33
Faustino hadn't returned to
the Green Lake since 2007,


88
0:7:31,33 --> 0:7:33,48
when his nephew started stealing
his cattle and


89
0:7:33,48 --> 0:7:36,15
selling the meat in
nearby towns.


90
0:7:36,15 --> 0:7:38,37
Due to his age and the vast
amount of land on this


91
0:7:38,37 --> 0:7:40,77
property, it was impossible
for him to keep it under


92
0:7:40,77 --> 0:7:42,59
constant surveillance.


93
0:7:42,59 --> 0:7:45,52
Feeling powerless over what was
happening to him, he let


94
0:7:45,52 --> 0:7:48,43
his cattle run free and brought
in Marcos Lancaster to


95
0:7:48,43 --> 0:7:51,22
take care of it, but more
importantly, to protect him.

ADRI MURGUIA: It's impossible
to understand who Faustino


99
0:8:13,12 --> 0:8:16,3
really is, when like his nephew
or brother, we have a


100
0:8:16,3 --> 0:8:18,94
very limited view of the life
of a man that has spent most


101
0:8:18,94 --> 0:8:21,7
of his time on Earth alone.


102
0:8:21,7 --> 0:8:23,38
He shared some stories with us,
but who knows what he's


103
0:8:23,38 --> 0:8:25,15
chosen to keep to himself.


104
0:8:25,15 --> 0:8:27,48
And it's difficult to say
whether or not we would have


105
0:8:27,48 --> 0:8:29,4
liked to meet him 30 years
ago, when he was very


106
0:8:29,4 --> 0:8:32,13
different, given the few things
we know about him now.


107
0:8:32,13 --> 0:8:35,71



108
0:8:35,71 --> 0:8:39,22
Here's an 81-year-old man that
is kind and welcoming.


109
0:8:39,22 --> 0:8:42,22
And it might seem natural
to see him living alone.


110
0:8:42,22 --> 0:8:45,28
But he makes it look so simple,
when the few days


111
0:8:45,28 --> 0:8:47,95
we've been here have proven that
we couldn't have survived


112
0:8:47,95 --> 0:8:49,2
without him.

After spending four days with
him, it's impossible to

imagine spending a lifetime in
Chilean Patagonia, imitating


123
0:9:28,24 --> 0:9:31,13

gauchos, something
