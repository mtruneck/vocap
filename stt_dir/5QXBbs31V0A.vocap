###9 MALE SPEAKER: What's up?
###10 We're at Burnside.
###12 Pretty sick session.
###14 Rick McCrank, going off.
###17 And we're going to talk to Julien, Cardiel, Q, who's a
###20 local here, ask them some cool stuff.
###23 Anyway, pretty psyched.
###25 It's like a historical meeting of the minds on skateboards.
###30 MALE SPEAKER: Here he goes.
###31 
###35 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Nice.
###36 
###39 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): [INAUDIBLE] is
###40 a constant at Burnside.
###41 
###44 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): You should have been here earlier
###45 when we were here.
###48 MALE SPEAKER: Got to say I scratched it at least.
###50 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Weren't you here at five in
###51 the morning?
###52 MIKE CARROLL: I scratched this earlier.
###52 MALE SPEAKER: Since I missed the 6:00 AM session.
###55 MALE SPEAKER: You came at the 6:00 AM session?
###57 MIKE CARROLL: Yeah.
###58 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): All gayed up?
###59 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): What brought that on?
###60 
###67 [CHEERING]
###73 PAT QUIRK: Yeah, man!
###74 That's good dude.
###74 Way to rip it man.
###75 Kill it, man.
###77 Wow, I see it can be done now after seeing that guy do it.
###81 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): So how long has
###83 Burnside been goin'?
###84 PAT QUIRK: I think since 1991 or something.
###87 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): It was originally just a bank?
###89 PAT QUIRK: Yeah, it was that bank up there.
###91 That thing just didn't have any tranny at the bottom.
###94 It just kind of went down to like a--
###94 [FFFT].
###96 There was two little banks they built side to side on the
###100 big things so you could go from one to the other.
###104 Kick turn, or some people would fakey slide.
###107 It actually was very hard to do.
###109 Really, Burnside brought a lot of heads together that didn't
###112 get along with each other, and they eventually had to work
###115 with each other.
###116 Became like a new generation.
###119 Yeah, the park actually helped unite a lot of people, is what
###122 I'm trying to say.
###123 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): You remember Julien when he first
###125 started coming out?
###126 PAT QUIRK: I think so, man.
###127 I go hey, where you from, and he goes, I'm from the coast.
###130 And I always thought he was from the
###131 Oregon coast, but wherever.
###132 I remember people by their faces more than their names,
###135 because I know hundreds of thousands of people.
###137 I can't remember everybody's name.
###139 
###144 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): You come up here a lot?
###146 JULIEN STRANGER: Not really.
###148 Not much.
###150 At least a couple times a summer.
###152 But we used to just stay here.
###155 Live here, kind of.
###157 JOHN CARDIEL: Actually, there was dirt over there in that
###158 field, and we used to fucking sleep on
###161 cardboard boxes and shit.
###163 It was so raw, dude.
###164 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): No tents or anything?
###166 JOHN CARDIEL: No.
###166 Pre-tent years.
###168 Cardboard box on the ground.
###170 If you had a sleeping bag, maybe fight
###172 somebody for a car.
###174 Was about the best you could do.
###176 Was nasty, though.
###177 
###182 I came here when the first bowl was here.
###185 I came up here snowboarding on Mt.
###186 Hood one time.
###187 It was just one bowl.
###189 And then now it's fucking just advanced into the
###191 gnarliest shit ever.
###192 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): I remember in the spitfire
###194 video, it was just that quarter coming up the bank.
###197 JOHN CARDIEL: Yeah.
###197 They had the love seat.
###198 It was hella love.
###201 But it's always been hella love up here in fucking
###203 Burnside, man.
###204 
###213 PAT QUIRK: Yeah, I remember Cardiel.
###215 That guy was always coming up to Portland and do just some
###218 crazy ass shit that nobody did here.
###222 He actually was a pretty humble guy, too, and
###224 everybody liked him.
###225 And people look up to that dude as being one of the
###228 leaders of skateboarding at that time.
###229 And one of the most radical people.
###231 
###237 If you look at it, it's almost like a jigsaw puzzle because
###239 it's all these little sections.
###242 The concrete guys would come by here with the trucks, and
###245 if they had extra mud they'd drop it off here.
###247 A lot of it was donations, or just people that skated
###251 putting their money together, and we'd get enough money to
###253 build another section.
###256 Really, it's like a patchwork quilt.
###258 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Seems a lot
###259 easier to skate now.
###260 JULIEN STRANGER: Much.
###260 Much smoother.
###261 Yeah.
###262 But then, wheels were bigger, so, you know.
###264 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Wheels were bigger then?
###265 JULIEN STRANGER: Yeah.
###267 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): The first time I came here it
###268 seemed so rough that I was like, how do people-- like I
###271 saw some of the videos and I was like, oh, it's going to be
###274 easy, and then you get to-- you're like [BRRRRRRR].
###276 JULIEN STRANGER: Well, you can see right there, it has a
###278 whole new floor.
###279 But the original Burnside was on this.
###283 So, this is what it was for a long time.
###287 Does look like it's in really good shape right now, though.
###289 
###296 [CHEERING]
###303 PAT QUIRK: Burnside's still got a good feeling to it, man.
###306 It's been around a while, and it's got roots.
###308 Everybody tries to get along with other people.
###310 If you can't get along, go somewhere else.
###313 It's got established ways that people do business here.
###316 There's things you do, and there's things you don't do.
###318 
###325 MALE SPEAKER: Pretty nice.
###328 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Hey, Rick.
###329 
###335 PAT QUIRK: People come here to visit this place, they don't
###337 even skate.
###338 They go, alright, man, we just heard about it, and they take
###340 pictures of it like it's an icon.
###342 Well it's been in Tony Hawk's video, or whatever, and the
###347 Free Willy.
###348 Burnside's been in a lot of weird--
###350 and I think it attracts some weird people.
###354 It's like a shrine to them, or something.
###358 It's kind of funny.
###358 We should sell little souvenirs.
###361 "I visited Burnside." "I survived Burnside."
###366 MALE SPEAKER (OFFSCREEN): Alright.
###366 Thanks, dude.
###367 PAT QUIRK: Alright, man.
###368 That's pretty cool, dude.
###369 Yeah, I like talking about Burnside.
###371 It's better than talking about yourself.
###372
