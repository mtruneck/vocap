###7 RYAN DUFFY: Hey, I'm Ryan Duffy, and we're
###9 here in New York City.
###10 We actually just got back to the States.
###12 We spent some time down in Colombia, where we found out
###15 that some of the locals--
###17 they fuck donkeys.
###18 
###27 We're on the Caribbean here in Cartagena, Colombia.
###29 
###37 The city basically looks like it was constructed from the
###39 daydreams of frustrated nine-to-fivers.
###43 You can picture some fat guy in a cubicle going, goddamn, I
###46 just wish I was on a beach somewhere that was more
###48 beautiful than any beach I've ever seen in a city with
###51 absolutely beautiful architecture and filled with
###54 gorgeous women.
###55 
###58 That's Cartagena.
###58 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###65 RYAN DUFFY: Some of our friends had been telling us
###66 that on the northern coast of Colombia, people fuck donkeys.
###70 
###73 Foolishly, we basically said, we'll believe
###75 that when we see it.
###76 So we flew down to Cartagena and figured we'd do some
###79 investigating of our own.
###81 
###88 ANASTASIA MALONEY: It's a really macho culture.
###89 And they really value the chase here.
###91 Colombian men think the chase is incredibly important.
###96 I'm from London.
###96 I'm a freelance journalist here.
###98 I've been living here for five years.
###101 And I'm married to a Colombian.
###102 Colombian men think they're the best dancers in the world
###104 because they've never had anyone to tell them otherwise.
###107 People used to talk, and they used to say, oh, the
###108 Costonians are--
###110 all they do is party, they drink, and--
###112 the joke was--
###113 they fuck donkeys.
###115 No one actually said, I've done it.
###116 They'd always said, oh no, my friends have done it, and it's
###118 quite common that you lived on a farm, you'll see people with
###123 their own special donkey.
###124 And yes, it's something that you do.
###125 It's totally cultural and it's normal.
###128 It's just a different way of seeing sex.
###131 It's just a different way of looking at it.
###133 RYAN DUFFY: Right.
###134 FEMALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING SPANISH]

###178 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###194 RYAN DUFFY: We're here in Turbaco, which is just a
###196 little bit outside of Cartagena.
###198 We're getting a tour of the land from
###200 our new friends here.
###201 And then we're going to go see about this
###203 donkey fucking thing.
###204 
###215 So when we got back from Colombia, we were so freaked
###218 out and so totally confused by what we'd seen and what you're
###221 about to see that we felt like we really had to go see a sex
###224 therapist, if only so we didn't spend the next two
###227 weeks of our lives crying in the fetal position.
###230 So we're here in the offices of Dr. Hani Miletski.
###233 She is the author of this book, which is Understanding
###235 Bestiality and Zoophilia.
###237 Could you break down what's bestiality, what's zoophilia?
###240 What are the differences in terms?
###242 HANI MILETSKI: There's really very different
###244 things, those two.
###246 Bestiality is sex with animals.
###248 That's the act.
###250 And zoophilia is more about feelings, about attraction.
###256 When somebody uses "zoophile," it's sort of like a sexual
###258 orientation in a way, while bestiality is sort of like
###262 using the animal as a form of masturbation.
###266 Bestiality has been going on throughout history in every
###270 culture, basically.
###271 In my book, I even mention an agriculture society in
###275 northern Colombia called Cagaba.
###277 And in that society, it is an ancient pre-Colombian belief.
###282 "Adolescent males will not achieve competence in marriage
###286 unless they practice intercourse with donkeys."
###288 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###296 RYAN DUFFY: Colombia is very religious and super Catholic.
###301 So a lot of these girls are not having sex until they're
###306 married or whatever it is.
###307 All of which is fine, but all of which leaves our friend
###311 over here and various other 14-year-olds with basically a
###316 six-year long case of blue balls.
###318 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###327 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###328 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING SPANISH]

###336 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING SPANISH]

###353 
###369 FEMALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###370 
###385 RYAN DUFFY: What's with the whole
###386 initiation thing, anyway?
###388 You're not going to find that in the States, right?
###389 You get initiated together.
###391 It's 13-year-old boys and girls in rec rooms groping
###394 each other and it's awkward and terrible, but they're of
###397 the same species.
###398 So what's keeping that from happening here?
###401 ANASTASIA MALONEY: There comes a certain age of 12, 13, 14,
###403 and if they hadn't had a sexual experience, they hadn't
###406 had sex, then they're not a man.
###408 I mean, they just can't go around saying
###410 that they're a virgin.
###411 RYAN DUFFY: So in junior high, a lot of credibility is based
###414 on how many people you've made out with and all that stuff.
###419 So we're trying to sort out here which one of these two
###422 little guys--
###423 both of them are 14-- have fucked more donkeys.
###426 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###428 
###432 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###435 FEMALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###436 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING SPANISH]

###453 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###455 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###456 
###461 RYAN DUFFY: Oh my god.
###462 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###463 
###470 RYAN DUFFY: We heard a lot of different reasoning from the
###475 folks we spoke to down there.
###478 And it ran the gamut between really practical reasons to
###482 stuff that we found a little more far-fetched, like, oh, it
###485 enlarges the size of the penis.
###487 HANI MILETSKI: I have heard that there are other
###490 civilizations who believe that having sex with an animal,
###495 specifically donkey--
###496 I mean, that's what I came across--
###498 will enlarge penises.
###501 Like Muslim countries, fathers will encourage their sons to
###506 have sex with a donkey so that their penises will grow and
###511 that they will learn to be better lovers.
###513 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###515 
###530 RYAN DUFFY: We're about a 35 minute cab ride outside of
###535 Cartagena, which is a beautiful Caribbean city where
###542 I'd say-- a rough estimate--
###543 every other girl is a fucking 10, give or take.
###548 And the ugly girls are sevens.
###551 And we are here, 35 minutes from there, and our friend
###556 here is going to fuck a donkey.
###558 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###564 
###567 RYAN DUFFY: So after talking to all these folks in Turbaco,
###569 hearing all their stories, pretty much thought that we'd
###572 heard and seen it all.
###575 Little did we know that our cab driver was so happy to
###579 help and eager to share this part of the culture with us,
###583 that we were about to see a whole lot more.
###586 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###594 RYAN DUFFY: So Martin took us out to this field.
###596 And the sun was setting and there were all kinds of trees
###599 and a couple little lakes, and it was quite beautiful.
###603 MARTIN: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###604 
###649 HANI MILETSKI: What I'm hearing from people who had
###651 sex with animals and then they want to have sex with humans,
###655 how different it is for them--
###658 that they're not equipped with the knowledge of what to do
###662 when-- they call it "mind games." That with people you
###666 have to play mind games and you have to figure out what
###668 they want, while the animals, it's like it's right there.
###672 And then, if you try to translate
###675 that to humans, it's--
###678 humans are a lot more complicated.
###680 On top of the fact that sometimes it feels different.
###683 Especially, I hear from men who had sex with female dogs
###687 that the female dogs are a lot tighter.
###690 And they say, after you had sex with a female dog, you
###694 don't want to have sex with a woman anymore.
###696 MARTIN: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###697 
###720 HANI MILETSKI: And even when it comes to zoophilia, I mean
###723 like sexual orientation, there's different degrees.
###726 Somebody may be completely straight and somebody may be
###729 completely gay, but there's all these different shades in
###731 the middle.
###732 And I think Martin is somewhere in the middle,
###735 because he has a wife and I'm assuming he has sex with her,
###740 but because he was talking about, fantasizing about,
###744 women, I would assume that he's not completely zoo.
###749 He's somewhere in between.
###752 MARTIN: [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###753 
###767 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###777 RYAN DUFFY: So Martin is back there preparing.
###783 He's getting himself aroused and
###786 preparing to fuck the donkey.
###787 
###791 So he's going to give us a shout when
###792 he's ready to mount.
###795 
###799 There's nothing good.
###801 It's walking behind a tree to find a-- oh no.
###805 Oh no.
###807 
###809 It's like the surprise you knew was coming and you didn't
###811 want to be there.
###813 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###828 RYAN DUFFY: Really not into it, man.
###830 It's one of those careful what you ask for situations where I
###835 thought it was going to be really funny, and now I'm so
###837 bummed and there's not enough fucking
###839 rum in all of Colombia.
###844 We were told a variety of reasons that
###845 this might be happening.
###847 We were told it's a gender role thing.
###849 We were told it has to do with the predominant
###851 Catholicism in Colombia.
###853 Even an economic reason was suggested to us.
###855 There's a million things.
###857 I'm not going to wrap this up in any tidy package, because
###860 it doesn't exist.
###860 I watched a man fuck a donkey, and it probably changed me for
###865 the rest of my life.
###866 But the reality probably is that there are probably people
###869 fucking animals all over the fucking place.
###871 And it's certainly not distinctly a Colombian thing.
###875 Now I definitely think it's safe to say that we really
###877 have seen it all.
###878 Way too damn much, in fact.
###880 Even now, back in New York, everywhere I look, I keep
###883 seeing these Colombian donkeys.
