###4 Your true wealth is your time and freedom.  Money is just a tool for trading your time.
###9 It's a container to store your economic energy until you're ready to deploy it.
###13 But the whole world has been turned away from real money and has been fooled into using currency, -
###19 a deceiptful imposter that is silently stealing your two most valuable assets.
###24 Your time and your freedom.  Welcome to the rabbit hole.
###32 We are entering a period of financial crisis that is the greatest the world has ever known.
###37 The wealth transfer that will take place during this decade is the greatest wealth transfer in history.
###44 Wealth is never destroyed.  It is merely transferred.
###47 And that means that on the opposite side of every crisis there is an opportunity.
###52 The great news is that all you have to do to turn this crisis into your great opportunity is to educate yourself.
###60 I believe that the best investment that you can make in your lifetime is your own education.
###67 Education on the history of money.
###69 Education on finance.  Education on how the global economy works.
###74 Education on how all of these guys, the central bankers, the stock market, how they can cheat you.  How they can scam you.
###82 If you learn what is going on and how the financial world works, you can put yourself on the correct side of this wealth transfer.
###92 Winston Churchill once said that the further you look into the past, the further that you can see into the future.
###98 This program is all about creating your own crystal ball.
###102 Being able to gaze into the future.
###104 Being able to change this crisis, the greatest crisis in the history of mankind, into your great opportunity.
###126 The hidden secrets of money.  Some of them are hidden in plain sight.
###130 They're like right in front of you.
###132 Uh, the way the monetary system works is something that isn't actually hidden away from all of us.
###138 It's out in the open, but it's complex and people just don't, they can't see how it works.
###144 It's hard for them to imagine that we're living in such a hoax.
###149 Others are meant to be secret, but the truth is slowly coming out.
###153 Like the Federal Reserve being a private corporation and not really part of the U.S. Government.
###160 But when I started studying this, uh, what I found was that there was no place that I could point people to where they could get it all in one spot.
###169 And so I basically decided to write my book about it and consolidate monetary history, economics, the markets, uh, the fundamentals of gold and silver.
###179 There's a lot of smoke and mirrors in economics, and I've sort of made it my job to lift the fog for people.
###196 Welcome to Egypt.  This is where it all began.
###200 Roughly 5,000 years ago, the Egyptians started using gold and silver as their predominant form of currency,-
###206 but it was not yet money.
###208 The pieces of gold and silver that they were using were odd sizes and weights.  Odd purities.
###215 So it still was not interchangable where each unit is the same as the next.  This meant that nothing really had a price yet.
###223 You couldn't put a price of so many coins on something because they didn't have coins yet.  Trade was still difficult.
###231 It was still a guessing game when it came to the exchange of values.
###236 One of the reasons that we are in the financial mess that we are today globally is that people do not understand the difference between currency and money.
###246 Currency is a medium of exchange, a unit of account.  It is portable, durable, divisible, and something called fungible.
###256 Fungible means that each unit is the same as the next unit.
###260 A dollar in my pocket buys the same amount as a dollar in your pocket.
###264 Money is all of those things plus a store of value over a long period of time.
###271 Even financial planners, bankers, your accountant, they don't understand the difference between currency and money.
###279 The currency in your pocket is a medium of exchange.  It's a unit of account because it's got numbers on it.
###287 It's somewhat durable, it's portable, it's divisible in that you can make change, and it's fungible.
###293 A dollar in my pocket buys the same amount as a dollar in your pocket.
###297 But because governments can print more and more and more of it and dilute the currency supply,-
###304 it's continually transferring wealth out of your pocket, out of your bank account to the government and to the banking system.
###313 The reason that gold and silver are the optimum form of money is because of their properties.
###319 It's an easy medium of exchange because gold and silver store a large amount of value in a very small area.
###327 It's a unit of account.  Pure gold has the same value all over the planet.
###332 So an ounce of gold buys the same amount here in Egypt as it would in China or in the United States.
###339 It's durable.  The same gold that Egyptians were using in trade 5,000 years ago is still here with us today.
###347 It does not corrode.  It's divisible.
###350 You can make change with it.  It's very portable.
###353 You can use something like oil as money.  It's just that you can't carry around a barrel of oil on your back.
###360 It's fungible.  Pure gold is the same wherever it is on earth.
###365 Pure silver is the same wherever it is on earth.  It's limited in quantity.
###369 That's the  reason that it maintains its purchasing power.  Governments cannot print it.
###374 Over the last 5,000 years, only gold and silver have maintained their purchasing power.
###380 There have been thousands upon thousands of fiat currencies.
###383 Currencies that are unbacked by gold or silver, and they have all gone to zero.  It's a 100 percent failure rate.
###393 Well, fiat currency, of course, is um, a currency that is, exists at the dictate or by fiat from, from a government.
###402 They have their printing presses, and the paper money rolls off the printing presses.
###407 And then they give it the fiat designation which then makes the currency official.
###412 It's just worthless paper, but when Ben Bernake gives it the special sign, and they have the cult meeting -
###418 at the Federal Open Market Committee meetings, it suddenly becomes currency.
###423 If you look at what's really going on it's, it's a con game.  And so there's confidence.
###428 Well, the Federal Reserve is very forthright about what they're doing.
###432 If you read their website they'll tell you it's a confidence game.
###435 They tell that there's no intrinsic value in their money.
###439 They'll tell you that they print it backed by absolutely nothing.
###442 They actually display all these facts.
###445 But if you tell somebody in the public that this stuff is created out of thin air, there's no backing whatsover -
###451 , it's absolutely worthless, it's about as valuable as Monopoly money, they'll look at you like you're nuts.
###458 Is there an example throughout history of a fiat currency, a piece of paper that's unbacked by anything, surviving?
###466 Short answer, no.
###468 Long answer, no.  And here's why.
###472 When Addison Wiggin took over at The Daily Reckoning, they got cranked up.
###475 Uh, Bill Bonner asked him to catalogue all of the fiat currencies throughout history and what happened to each of them.
###481 Addison dutifully went to work.  Within a short period of time he had gone through the alphabet.  All the fiat currencies that started with the letter A were done.
###491 They all went to zero.  He was halfway through the letter B and all the fiat currencies that started with the letter B,-
###496 and there were 600 of them in just the first letter and a half of the alphabet.
###502 And every single one of them went to zero.  Every one.
###510 600 fiat currencies that start with the letter A, and half of the ones that start with the letter B, there are 600 of these things.
###518 Not one ever came close.
###521 And you think this one, the United States dollar is gonna be the first one after all that?  I don't think so.
###527 No.  No currency, fiat currency has ever survived.
###530 None.
###536 The thing about money is there actually is a fairly well accepted definition of what money is.
###540 The question is as you apply that definition to particular things that are, people claim to be money, do they fit the definition?
###547 Well just take the paper dollar for example.  How well does it perform those functions?
###550 Will it store a value?  Uh, the dollar has lost 95 percent of its purchasing power, uh, since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913.
###558 So not very good as a store of value.
###560 One of the things I do is, uh, just a way to get the audience's attention is I have a slide and there are three pictures on the slide.
###566 One is a pile of Monopoly money.  The other one is a pile of Federal Reserve notes.
###570 Uh, what Americans would call paper money.
###573 Uh, the other one is a solid gold, uh, American Eagle, uh, one ounce coin.
###577 And the title of this slide is which of these is not like the other.
###580 And if you know the show Sesame Street or if you have children who watch it, it's one of the favorite vignettes in Sesame Street.
###586 And what it really is is a kind of IQ test for five year olds.
###589 They're supposed to look at the three things and look at characteristics and find the one that's not like the other.
###593 Well, I've shown this slide to, um, groups of, you know, Ivy League university professors, and I've also shown it to, uh, you know, uh, children.
###601 You know, kind of find results in my nieces and newphews and so forth.
###604 Uh, and when the, uh, professors look at it they say well, um, clearly the, uh, the dollars are not like the others -
###611 'cause gold has no role as money and Monopoly money is junk and the American dollar is a store of value.
###616 So that's not like the other.  But the children look at it and they say well, the gold coin is not like the other -
###621 because the other two are just piles of paper, and the gold coin is clearly something different.
###625 So my question to the audience is who's smarter?  A five year old or an Ivy League professor?
###631 Before World War I, each note that a treasury issued would say that there has been deposited with the United States Treasury -
###639 20 dollars in gold coin payable to the bearer upon demand.
###643 The money was in the vault.  The currency was a note they gave you that was a claim check.
###649 Only a claim check on the money.  The same as if you go to the dry cleaners and you give them your shirt and they give you a claim check for your shirt.
###658 The value is, is that shirt at the dry cleaners.  Not the piece of paper that says that you own that shirt.
###664 So our currency that's circulated was the paper U.S. dollars and they were claim checks on money.
###673 The next hidden secret is the difference between currency and money.
###677 Money must be a store of value and maintain its purchasing power over long periods of time.
###683 As we progress through this series, you'll learn that national currencies are really a tool used by the government -
###689 and the financial sector to leach away your time and your freedom by stealing your purchasing power.
###696 So rather than storing your economic energy, currencies leak.
###701 Now compare that to the gold and silver the Egyptians were using.  Like I started with, it still wasn't money because it wasn't interchangable yet.
###704 Like I started with, it still wasn't money because it wasn't interchangable yet.
###710 But they were on the right track as gold and silver have proven over thousands of years to be the ultimate store of value.
###718 Gold is only formed when a star explodes, a supernova.  And it stays around forever.
###725 This is one of the properties that make it the ultimate money.
###736 You know, people are amazed that after 5,000 years the pyramids are still here.
###742 But what I'm more amazed at is that the currency that the people that built this were using,-
###748 that currency, that gold and silver that they were using in trade on a daily basis, is still around today.
###755 It may have been melted down and re-refined and it's in a coin or a bar or in some piece of jewelry.
###762 But it's still with us today and it still purchases something.
###769 Yes, it is the ultimate money because there is nothing else even in the same league.  It's divisible.
###774 It's permanent.  It's a store of value.
###778 It's, uh, a unit of account.  It's got everything you want out of money, but it doesn't go away and it can't be increased.
###788 That is what makes gold the most beautiful money of all.  What more can you ask out of a money?
###795 It keeps governments under control.  You can maintain a solvent system.
###800 Governments don't like gold at present because they're getting away with the fiat currencies, and they'll do everything they can to discredit it as an asset class.
###809 I mean, my goodness.  Gold has, uh, outperformed the Dow Jones Industrial Average in each of the last seven years.
###816 Uh, yet it's not considered a legitimate asset class.  Why?
###821 Again, it's the fear that maybe gold will be imposed on the system.
###825 That it will constrain government ability to spend beyond its means.
###830 They can't print it.
###831 They can't print it, no.
###833 The proper definition of inflation, I use Milton Friedman's definition.  Inflation is an expansion of the currency supply.
###841 Deflation is a contraction of the currency supply.  If you expand the currency supply, eventually prices will rise.
###850 And if you contract the currency supply, eventually prices will fall.
###857 This is a pool.  But it's not a pool of water.
###860 This is a, the currency pool.  And these are prices.
###864 And if you expand the currency supply, prices like a sponge in water have to rise to suck up the excess currency.
###872 Governments never stop printing more currency and adding currency to circulation.
###879 Therefore, prices keep on going up.  Not because they stuff that you're trying to buy is changing.
###886 The real estate doesn't change.  What has changed is the currency purchases less and less.
###892 It's the currency going down.  Not prices going up.
###896 The truth is, what we have that makes our world work right now is a big story.  None of it's real.
###901 It's all just promises.  And if you think about it, that's how currency began to work in the beginning.
###907 You know, before we had currency we had barter.
###909 I'll give you three coconuts and you give me four fish 'cause that's kind of a fair exchange on coconuts and fish.
###914 But that got complicated so we had to invent this thing called money to be a divisible, portable medium of exchange.
###920 And the challenge is that we've lost that a long time ago.  We lost having things of value be our currency.
###927 And now we have this thing called numbers and accounts.  But trust me.
###929 It is not real.  It's a big made up story.
###933 One of the biggest make believe stories ever is called quantitative easing which sounds complex, -
###938 but it's really just a smoke and mirrors term for currency creation.
###942 QE started with the banking bailouts back in 2009.
###946 This currency was created out of thin air and then given to the banks who paid themselves record bonuses in reward for crashing the world economy.
###956 This is a global phenomenon, but all you have to remember for now is that whether it's QE, bailouts, or stimulus programs, -
###963 these are all just voodoo, hocus pocus terms for increased currency creation.
###970 I believe gold and silver will reassert themselves as money and when they do, there just isn't enough.
###976 And their purchasing power is going to go up many, many, many times.
###985 Egypt is an amazing place.  There's a franticness about it, an utter chaos.  Especially like the traffic.
###993 When it comes to like all of the merchants that are trying to get every last dime out of you, -
###998 you get fleeced to the point where you come back with an empty wallet.  [LAUGH]
###1008 But you know what?  They're amateurs compared to Wall Street.
###1016 In the past several years, I've, I've spoken in many countries about the crisis that's coming, -
###1021 and a lot of people think that they're gonna be okay in their country.
###1025 That it's only gonna happen in the United States or maybe the United States and Europe.
###1029 Uh, but what they don't realize is that this is a global phenomenon.
###1033 I got to show you something here.  This is, uh, base currency in the United States.
###1040 This is the number of paper dollars that exist basically.
###1044 It took 200 years to go from no dollars in existence to 825 billion.
###1049 And then we had the bailouts, and then we had QE1, Quantitative Easing 1.
###1056 Then QE2.  And then we had QE3 and then QE4 and then soon we're gonna have QE57 and QE382.  [LAUGH]
###1066 And, uh, it isn't just here.  This is what the Canadian currency supply looks like.
###1074 This is Australia.  South Africa.  Russia.
###1080 Now this starts out in just the year 2001, and this is like 18 times more currency in existence in a little over a decade.
###1090 Uh, here's Singapore.  Same story.  Look at that.  Since the crisis, just bam.
###1098 India.  China.  Every government on the planet is -
###1103 doing this insane deficit spending and expanding their currency supplies, uh, doing bailouts.
###1110 And history shows that there is no example of this turning out well.
###1115 It is sometimes amazing that we haven't experienced more inflation than we have.
###1122 If they keep expanding the money supply so vastly, why aren't our prices growing faster than they really are?
###1129 And the answer is that a good chunk of the money that the Fed created has been shipped overseas.
###1135 Uh, I remember early in my research I heard this expression that the Americans have exported their inflation.
###1141 I thought what is that?  How can you export your inflation?  Put it in a box and send it out?  What do you do?
###1146 Well now I understand.  You export your inflation by simply sending all these dollars that you created to these other countries -
###1153 and then they send you their refrigerators and their cars and whatever, their TV sets.
###1157 So you get hardware and they get little pieces of paper.  It's a great deal for the American people for a while.  For a while.
###1166 Sooner or later all of those pigeons come home to roost.
###1170 When the time comes as it looks like it's now coming, when the rest of the world is saying nuh-uh we don't want to play this game anymore.
###1177 Uncle Sam's dollars are just becoming worthless.  There are too many of them.
###1181 We've got to find something else other than American dollars.  Then those dollars start to come back to America.
###1188 People, we don't want them anymore.  What do we do with them?
###1190 Once this revs up and we've got this, this little trickle of money coming back that we'd previously exported, -
###1197 when, once it becomes a flood and it starts to rush back, now we are getting our former exported inflation brought back to us.
###1207 And then we'll see the quantity of money inside the United States grow much more rapidly -
###1212 even than the Federal Reserve can create it because we're getting our previous money back.
###1217 And, uh, that's when we will really see the tanking of the U.S. Dollar in terms of what it will buy.
###1224 During the second round of quantitative easing, global food prices went up 60 percent, -
###1229 and this created a humanitarian disaster for the two billion people on earth who live on less than two dollars a day.
###1237 These people were hungry to start with.  They became hungrier and some of them started overthrowing their governments in North Africa and around the Middle East.
###1246 So quantitative easing was the spark that ignited the Arab Spring.
###1250 So that's, that's it.  When you create money, you get some sort of inflation.
###1254 It just depends on where the inflation goes.
###1267 Given the premise that you have a permanent underclass or poor class and how does inflation affect them disproportionately,
###1275 um, it affects them basically in the percentage of their income that goes to food.
###1283 And we see this as a ratio, and we know that there are some danger points.
###1287 For example in Egypt recently, once that ratio got to 40 percent of income going to food -
###1294 and the price of food rising due to inflation, when it got to 40 percent that's, uh, historically a point where people actually stage a revolution.
###1302 That's exactly what we saw.  The French Revolution similarly was all around the price of food getting to a certain critical point where people simply, the risk-reward for revolution was favorable toward revolution.
###1319 Well, exactly right because when you have a runaway inflation, it's punishing the very people who are most productive in society.
###1327 In other words the people that produce more than they consume and save the difference.
###1332 The problem is is that those productive people, the savers, save in their national currency -
###1338 and unfortunately the national currency is just a fiat piece of paper at this point.
###1344 So when it's destroyed through runaway inflation, that 100,000 dollars that you were hoping to retire on doesn't exist.
###1352 And the things that you were gonna buy with it and provide for others don't exist either.  Now what are you gonna do?
###1360 So that all seems pretty scary.  However, uh, you know, this is going to happen and you can only play the hand that you're dealt.
###1369 But the great news is that gold and silver always end up doing an accounting of the expansion of the currency supplies.
###1375 Basically the will of the public and the free markets.
###1379 When governments do this kind of stuff to their currency supply, they debase it, eventually it comes back in inflation.
###1385 People sense the loss of their puchasing power.  They rush back to gold and silver and they bid the value of -
###1391 the gold and silver up in the country until it meets or exceeds the value of all the currency in circulation.
###1398 This is a process that's been going on over and over again throughout history except this time it's happening on a global scale.
###1406 It has never before happened in all countries at once.
###1410 And that means that this is the greatest wealth transfer in history.
###1414 Therefore it's the greatest opportunity in history and it's not gonna happen again in your lifetime.
###1423 So now we've learned that your true wealth is your time and your freedom.
###1427 Money is a trading tool that stores the economic energy that is your time and freedom whereas currencies leak them away.
###1436 Gold and silver are the ultimate money simply because of their properties.
###1440 Fiat currencies are based solely on confidence and always return to their intrinsic value of zero.
###1446 Governments don't like gold because it imposes restraint.  Rising prices are a symptom of an expanding currency supply -
###1453 and gold and silver always acocunt for an expanding currency supply.
###1458 So that's it for this episode.  Join me next time as we begin to investigate how monetary history just repeats and repeats -
###1465 and how gold and silver always win the battle between currency and money.
###1469 Until then, my challenge to you is to stop calling currency money.  It's a crucial first step towards setting your mind free of all this economic voodoo and changing your context.
###1474 It's a crucial first step towards setting your mind free of all this economic voodoo and changing your context.
###1480 You can learn more by watching the bonus features on our website and if you have any questions you can post them there -
###1486 and we'll answer some of your questions in future bonus features.
###1490 So good luck.  Thanks for watching.  And we'll see you next time.
###1500 Good morning.
###1502 Wow.
###1506 What does fiat mean?
###1508 It comes from the Latin for crappy car.
###1522 I'm in the desert in a suit.
###1527 My camel died.
###1529 You're not too sure about that are you?  Huh?
###1536 I am ready for a, a good long nap.
###1540 Hi, welcome to this bonus feature for the very first episode of hidden secrets of money, -
###1546 uh, and this is currency vs money.  So that's the, uh, major topic-
