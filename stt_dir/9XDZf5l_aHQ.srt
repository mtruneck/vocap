1
0:0:0,386 --> 0:0:1,906
>> Good morning.


2
0:0:1,906 --> 0:0:5,136
Good morning, I'm Kathy White,
member of the Board of Regents,


3
0:0:5,136 --> 0:0:5,986
University of Michigan.


4
0:0:5,986 --> 0:0:9,256
And it's my pleasure to
welcome you here this morning.


5
0:0:9,256 --> 0:0:11,666
But I'm here to introduce
Mary Sue Coleman,


6
0:0:11,666 --> 0:0:14,726
our 13th president here at
the University of Michigan.


7
0:0:14,726 --> 0:0:20,216
And we are so proud that Time
Magazine has named President


8
0:0:20,216 --> 0:0:23,516
Coleman one of the 10
best university presidents


9
0:0:23,516 --> 0:0:25,516
in United States.


10
0:0:25,516 --> 0:0:34,516
[ Applause ]


11
0:0:34,516 --> 0:0:41,196
And she's just finished her year
as the chair of the Association


12
0:0:41,196 --> 0:0:42,916
of American Universities


13
0:0:42,916 --> 0:0:46,416
where she ably represented
North America's leading


14
0:0:46,416 --> 0:0:49,196
research universities.


15
0:0:49,196 --> 0:0:52,766
And as our president, she
has been very diligent


16
0:0:52,766 --> 0:0:55,166
about broadening the
university's reach


17
0:0:55,166 --> 0:1:0,786
and impact whether in
Detroit or in Brazil.


18
0:1:0,786 --> 0:1:3,666
And throughout her leadership,
she's been a strong advocate


19
0:1:3,666 --> 0:1:7,746
of the contributions,
creativity, and the innovation


20
0:1:7,746 --> 0:1:11,516
of Michigan student,
staff, faculty, and alumni.


21
0:1:11,516 --> 0:1:13,956
And most importantly, for
the Board of Regents we are


22
0:1:13,956 --> 0:1:16,196
so excited because Mary
Sue Coleman has brought us


23
0:1:16,196 --> 0:1:22,96
so many wonderful research,
resources from raising money,


24
0:1:22,96 --> 0:1:25,906
and that of course is needed
very much to help our faculty,


25
0:1:25,906 --> 0:1:30,706
staff, and students do all
the great work that they do.


26
0:1:30,706 --> 0:1:33,346
So please join me in welcoming
the president of the University


27
0:1:33,346 --> 0:1:35,516
of Michigan, Dr.
Mary Sue Coleman.


28
0:1:35,516 --> 0:1:46,66
[ Applause ]


29
0:1:46,66 --> 0:1:47,606
>> Well, good morning!


30
0:1:47,606 --> 0:1:50,396
[Multiple Speakers] And
thanks to all of you


31
0:1:50,396 --> 0:1:54,86
for braving the weather out
there to be here with us.


32
0:1:54,86 --> 0:1:57,146
And thanks to all those
who are here virtually


33
0:1:57,146 --> 0:1:59,226
around the campus.


34
0:1:59,226 --> 0:2:2,566
Our thoughts are certainly
with those on the East Coast


35
0:2:2,566 --> 0:2:5,186
who endured Hurricane
Sandy last night


36
0:2:5,186 --> 0:2:8,966
and the aftermath this morning.


37
0:2:8,966 --> 0:2:13,546
We gathered in this space a year
ago, and I believe we were lucky


38
0:2:13,546 --> 0:2:17,746
to squeeze onto the
October calendar this year.


39
0:2:17,746 --> 0:2:21,746
When Steve Ross made his
historic gift 8 years ago,


40
0:2:21,746 --> 0:2:23,596
we knew that it would
elevate everything


41
0:2:23,596 --> 0:2:25,396
about the business school.


42
0:2:25,396 --> 0:2:28,216
But I don't think anyone would
have predicted the demand


43
0:2:28,216 --> 0:2:30,926
for this view that you
see out the windows.


44
0:2:30,926 --> 0:2:34,546
So thank you, Steve, and thank
you to the Ross Business School


45
0:2:34,546 --> 0:2:37,426
for hosting us this morning.


46
0:2:37,426 --> 0:2:40,166
This is a special year,
for me personally,


47
0:2:40,166 --> 0:2:43,736
and more significantly, in
the life of the University.


48
0:2:43,736 --> 0:2:46,586
I've had the privilege now
of leading the University


49
0:2:46,586 --> 0:2:50,46
for 10 years, and it's been
a decade of challenges,


50
0:2:50,46 --> 0:2:53,596
transformation and
tremendous momentum.


51
0:2:53,596 --> 0:2:56,526
I continue to be energized
by the life-changing work


52
0:2:56,526 --> 0:3:0,106
of this institution, and by
the contributions of leaders


53
0:3:0,106 --> 0:3:3,276
like you from all
three campuses.


54
0:3:3,276 --> 0:3:8,166
When we talk of Michigan and
impact, the one name rises


55
0:3:8,166 --> 0:3:11,576
above all others,
Raoul Wallenberg.


56
0:3:11,576 --> 0:3:14,876
I hope you know his story.


57
0:3:14,876 --> 0:3:18,966
After earning his architecture
degree here in 1935,


58
0:3:18,966 --> 0:3:20,526
he went on to become one


59
0:3:20,526 --> 0:3:23,936
of the most noted humanitarians
of the last century.


60
0:3:23,936 --> 0:3:26,286
As a diplomat in Budapest,


61
0:3:26,286 --> 0:3:29,826
Raoul Wallenberg
repeatedly risked his life


62
0:3:29,826 --> 0:3:31,836
to rescue thousands of Jews


63
0:3:31,836 --> 0:3:35,156
from World War II's
concentration camps.


64
0:3:35,156 --> 0:3:38,116
He pulled them from
moving boxcars.


65
0:3:38,116 --> 0:3:42,76
When Nazis forced them to walk
to the camps, Wallenberg chased


66
0:3:42,76 --> 0:3:46,416
after them, shoving food
and medicine their way.


67
0:3:46,416 --> 0:3:49,856
He found countless ways
to shelter terrified men,


68
0:3:49,856 --> 0:3:52,446
women and children
trying to survive


69
0:3:52,446 --> 0:3:55,566
in what was then the
last surviving ghetto


70
0:3:55,566 --> 0:3:57,536
of Jews in Europe.


71
0:3:57,536 --> 0:4:3,156
He saved some 100,000, 100,000.


72
0:4:3,156 --> 0:4:8,56
And then he disappeared
at the hands of strangers.


73
0:4:8,56 --> 0:4:12,236
We are still seeking
answers about his fate.


74
0:4:12,236 --> 0:4:16,166
This year, 2012,
is the centennial


75
0:4:16,166 --> 0:4:18,26
of Raoul Wallenberg's birth.


76
0:4:18,26 --> 0:4:21,566
I can't think of no
more important occasion


77
0:4:21,566 --> 0:4:24,346
to dedicate our work
as a university


78
0:4:24,346 --> 0:4:26,736
to the values he lived.


79
0:4:26,736 --> 0:4:30,376
He loved to learn, he had
an appetite for adventure,


80
0:4:30,376 --> 0:4:34,496
and he embraced new people
and different places.


81
0:4:34,496 --> 0:4:39,726
He was and is a hero
of the highest order.


82
0:4:39,726 --> 0:4:43,696
He showed us, more than
any Michigan graduate,


83
0:4:43,696 --> 0:4:46,796
that one person can
make a difference.


84
0:4:46,796 --> 0:4:48,876
Could we, as students
and scholars,


85
0:4:48,876 --> 0:4:53,96
ask for greater inspiration?


86
0:4:53,96 --> 0:4:59,236
The University of Michigan
is indeed an inspiring place.


87
0:4:59,236 --> 0:5:2,226
And that's because of the
ideas, discoveries and service


88
0:5:2,226 --> 0:5:6,386
of our students,
staff and faculty.


89
0:5:6,386 --> 0:5:10,646
In the room today, we have
students like Conor Lane,


90
0:5:10,646 --> 0:5:12,996
an honors senior who
works as both an RA


91
0:5:12,996 --> 0:5:16,776
at the Residential
College and a volunteer


92
0:5:16,776 --> 0:5:18,996
at the Spectrum Center.


93
0:5:18,996 --> 0:5:21,816
And Jasmine Injejikian,


94
0:5:21,816 --> 0:5:25,216
who is leading this
year's Dance Marathon.


95
0:5:25,216 --> 0:5:28,926
That's hundreds of students
dancing for 30 straight hours


96
0:5:28,926 --> 0:5:32,976
to raise thousands for
children with disabilities.


97
0:5:32,976 --> 0:5:35,456
We're joined by staff
like Dan Rife,


98
0:5:35,456 --> 0:5:38,856
an engineer who combines
new technologies


99
0:5:38,856 --> 0:5:42,946
with human expertise to
conserve energy throughout our


100
0:5:42,946 --> 0:5:44,786
campus buildings.


101
0:5:44,786 --> 0:5:47,226
And Lieutenant Colonel
Lisa Franz,


102
0:5:47,226 --> 0:5:51,616
who leads our ROTC
program, Air Force ROTC,


103
0:5:51,616 --> 0:5:55,836
one of the three officer
training programs at Michigan.


104
0:5:55,836 --> 0:5:58,146
We have faculty like
Carla O'Connor,


105
0:5:58,146 --> 0:6:1,856
an engaging Thurnau Professor,
who is bringing her love


106
0:6:1,856 --> 0:6:5,226
of teaching and mentoring
to the dean's office


107
0:6:5,226 --> 0:6:7,756
in the School of Education.


108
0:6:7,756 --> 0:6:10,246
And professors like
Michael Boehnke,


109
0:6:10,246 --> 0:6:12,966
a world-class statistical
geneticist


110
0:6:12,966 --> 0:6:15,456
from the School of
Public Health.


111
0:6:15,456 --> 0:6:19,206
His breakthroughs help us
better understand the heredity


112
0:6:19,206 --> 0:6:25,846
of diabetes, bipolar disorder
and other debilitating diseases.


113
0:6:25,846 --> 0:6:30,506
I also want to recognize four
deans who are in the final year


114
0:6:30,506 --> 0:6:32,956
of their leadership tenures.


115
0:6:32,956 --> 0:6:36,46
Terry McDonald in the
College of Literature, Science


116
0:6:36,46 --> 0:6:42,976
and the Arts, Evan Caminker of
the Law School, Peter Polverini


117
0:6:42,976 --> 0:6:45,916
of the Dental School,
and Paul Courant


118
0:6:45,916 --> 0:6:48,696
of the University Libraries.


119
0:6:48,696 --> 0:6:52,636
These four have carried out
extraordinary work in one


120
0:6:52,636 --> 0:6:56,886
of the University's most
challenging fiscal eras.


121
0:6:56,886 --> 0:6:59,756
Their programs are
collectively stronger


122
0:6:59,756 --> 0:7:2,456
because of their good work.


123
0:7:2,456 --> 0:7:6,46
I also want to acknowledge
Fran Blouin, who is stepping


124
0:7:6,46 --> 0:7:8,666
down as the longest-serving
director


125
0:7:8,666 --> 0:7:11,666
of the Bentley Historical
Library.


126
0:7:11,666 --> 0:7:13,896
Fortunately for our students,


127
0:7:13,896 --> 0:7:19,846
he will be devoting himself full
time to the classroom next fall.


128
0:7:19,846 --> 0:7:25,186
At Michigan, we know-- because
it is borne out each day--


129
0:7:25,186 --> 0:7:27,766
that our diversity
is the backbone


130
0:7:27,766 --> 0:7:30,336
of our academic strength.


131
0:7:30,336 --> 0:7:36,196
Diversity is a core value of
this institution, in this room,


132
0:7:36,196 --> 0:7:40,36
across our campuses, and
wherever the University


133
0:7:40,36 --> 0:7:43,106
of Michigan is in the world.


134
0:7:43,106 --> 0:7:47,166
In the course of my decade
here, I have taken great pride


135
0:7:47,166 --> 0:7:50,786
in Michigan being the nation's
leading voice for the value


136
0:7:50,786 --> 0:7:55,106
of diversity-- in the
classroom, in the research lab,


137
0:7:55,106 --> 0:7:59,66
and in all parts of the
academic enterprise.


138
0:7:59,66 --> 0:8:2,646
But it's not simply an
outcome of the last decade.


139
0:8:2,646 --> 0:8:6,456
This is deeply embedded in our
culture and sense of identity


140
0:8:6,456 --> 0:8:9,736
from the University's
earliest days.


141
0:8:9,736 --> 0:8:13,46
The first black woman in America
to train as a dentist did


142
0:8:13,46 --> 0:8:17,146
so here-- more than
100 years ago.


143
0:8:17,146 --> 0:8:19,376
As did the first
African-American woman


144
0:8:19,376 --> 0:8:22,16
to earn a doctorate in physics.


145
0:8:22,16 --> 0:8:26,976
When an Ivy League school
rejected Jose Barbosa in 1877


146
0:8:26,976 --> 0:8:30,776
because of his race,
Michigan welcomed him.


147
0:8:30,776 --> 0:8:34,596
Our students said they did
not care about his skin color.


148
0:8:34,596 --> 0:8:38,516
In their words, what truly
mattered was "the quantity


149
0:8:38,516 --> 0:8:43,16
and quality of brains
in the cranium."


150
0:8:43,16 --> 0:8:45,836
Brains in the cranium.


151
0:8:45,836 --> 0:8:50,376
Dr. Jose Celso Barbosa would
go on to become the father


152
0:8:50,376 --> 0:8:54,266
of statehood for his
native Puerto Rico.


153
0:8:54,266 --> 0:8:57,806
This legacy of inclusion
and leadership brings


154
0:8:57,806 --> 0:9:2,826
with it a deep responsibility
to live out our values.


155
0:9:2,826 --> 0:9:6,666
We work hard at creating
and sustaining a community


156
0:9:6,666 --> 0:9:11,516
where diversity is sought and
valued across all pathways--


157
0:9:11,516 --> 0:9:17,476
racial, ethnic, gender, LGBT,
global and socioeconomic.


158
0:9:17,476 --> 0:9:20,56
We still have much work to do.


159
0:9:20,56 --> 0:9:21,526
That's why I am so pleased


160
0:9:21,526 --> 0:9:24,26
that LSA will launch
a new theme semester


161
0:9:24,26 --> 0:9:26,546
in January, Understanding Race.


162
0:9:26,546 --> 0:9:31,726
It is an important example of
just how critical it is for us


163
0:9:31,726 --> 0:9:35,216
to think substantively
about race and identity


164
0:9:35,216 --> 0:9:39,276
and to encourage a thoughtful
dialogue about these issues.


165
0:9:39,276 --> 0:9:46,446
I am a firm believer that
knowledge is contingent.


166
0:9:46,446 --> 0:9:49,506
The work we do today, and the
accomplishments we celebrate,


167
0:9:49,506 --> 0:9:52,406
would not be possible
without the faculty,


168
0:9:52,406 --> 0:9:55,336
staff and students
who came before us.


169
0:9:55,336 --> 0:9:59,76
When this year's Nobel Prize
for medicine was announced,


170
0:9:59,76 --> 0:10:0,926
one of the winners
was recognized


171
0:10:0,926 --> 0:10:4,876
for research he carried
out 50 years ago.


172
0:10:4,876 --> 0:10:6,666
Fifty years.


173
0:10:6,666 --> 0:10:10,706
His discovery about tadpole
cells has a direct impact


174
0:10:10,706 --> 0:10:12,926
on stem cell research
conducted today,


175
0:10:12,926 --> 0:10:15,626
including in our laboratories.


176
0:10:15,626 --> 0:10:18,836
This is the beauty and
power of scholarship.


177
0:10:18,836 --> 0:10:22,956
The commitments we make
today will have an impact 20,


178
0:10:22,956 --> 0:10:26,356
30 and 50 years from now.


179
0:10:26,356 --> 0:10:28,906
That's why I'm excited
to share with you some


180
0:10:28,906 --> 0:10:32,766
of our most significant
achievements and challenges,


181
0:10:32,766 --> 0:10:34,426
as well as several announcements


182
0:10:34,426 --> 0:10:37,976
that will take Michigan
in new directions.


183
0:10:37,976 --> 0:10:40,396
Let's begin with the arts.


184
0:10:40,396 --> 0:10:42,426
The Michigan environment
for arts


185
0:10:42,426 --> 0:10:45,306
and creativity is remarkable.


186
0:10:45,306 --> 0:10:49,856
Remarkable because it is of a
scope and scale you won't find


187
0:10:49,856 --> 0:10:52,716
at other national
research universities.


188
0:10:52,716 --> 0:10:59,196
We make art, we research art, we
present art and we preserve art.


189
0:10:59,196 --> 0:11:2,856
It can be in this weekend's
performance of Urinetown


190
0:11:2,856 --> 0:11:5,706
by UM-Flint theater students.


191
0:11:5,706 --> 0:11:9,16
Or the Kelsey Museum's
study of antiquities.


192
0:11:9,16 --> 0:11:13,746
It is the exhibit of priceless
Armenian books at UM-Dearborn.


193
0:11:13,746 --> 0:11:18,266
Or Band-o-rama at Hill
Auditorium itself a work of art


194
0:11:18,266 --> 0:11:21,856
and a campus icon
for the past century.


195
0:11:21,856 --> 0:11:25,396
We do art and science very well.


196
0:11:25,396 --> 0:11:30,156
What binds the two is our
capacity for creativity.


197
0:11:30,156 --> 0:11:35,56
And that is because of a culture
that encourages creative work


198
0:11:35,56 --> 0:11:37,376
and creative approaches.


199
0:11:37,376 --> 0:11:41,406
It is an environment in which
the University has invested 84


200
0:11:41,406 --> 0:11:45,366
million dollars since 2004.


201
0:11:45,366 --> 0:11:48,836
That includes a stunning
addition to the Museum of Art,


202
0:11:48,836 --> 0:11:52,216
a Symphony Band tour
of China, new programs


203
0:11:52,216 --> 0:11:56,566
for architecture students, and
more studio and gallery space.


204
0:11:56,566 --> 0:11:57,836
This morning, I'm excited


205
0:11:57,836 --> 0:12:2,416
to say our creative environment
is expanding once again.


206
0:12:2,416 --> 0:12:6,446
The School of Music, Theatre
and Dance is a point of pride


207
0:12:6,446 --> 0:12:10,756
for Michigan, with talent
that is second to no one.


208
0:12:10,756 --> 0:12:14,486
Now, these students, faculty
and staff are going to enjoy new


209
0:12:14,486 --> 0:12:18,66
and improved surroundings
to express their creativity,


210
0:12:18,66 --> 0:12:22,186
thanks to the vision of
longtime Michigan donors William


211
0:12:22,186 --> 0:12:24,316
and Delores Brehm.


212
0:12:24,316 --> 0:12:27,496
The Brehms are generously
providing 8 million dollars


213
0:12:27,496 --> 0:12:30,736
toward the renovation and
expansion of the Moore Building,


214
0:12:30,736 --> 0:12:34,446
a transformative project we
will ask the Board of Regents


215
0:12:34,446 --> 0:12:36,646
to approve next month.


216
0:12:36,646 --> 0:12:39,346
We anticipate new
rehearsal rooms, studios


217
0:12:39,346 --> 0:12:42,476
and a lecture hall, as
well as improved space


218
0:12:42,476 --> 0:12:46,46
for one-on-one time between
faculty and students.


219
0:12:46,46 --> 0:12:47,716
With the regents' approval,


220
0:12:47,716 --> 0:12:51,476
this will be a 23 million
dollar undertaking.


221
0:12:51,476 --> 0:12:53,946
The University will
provide 14 million,


222
0:12:53,946 --> 0:12:59,106
and we will seek additional
support from alumni and friends.


223
0:12:59,106 --> 0:13:2,26
I know that the faculty
from Music, Theatre


224
0:13:2,26 --> 0:13:7,416
and Dance will agree when I
say this project is overdue.


225
0:13:7,416 --> 0:13:11,946
It's genuinely exciting,
and complements new spaces


226
0:13:11,946 --> 0:13:13,966
such as the Walgreen
Drama Center


227
0:13:13,966 --> 0:13:17,276
and the Arthur Miller Theater.


228
0:13:17,276 --> 0:13:20,866
For more evidence of Michigan's
capacity for creativity,


229
0:13:20,866 --> 0:13:24,436
we have the new Penny W. Stamps
School of Art and Design.


230
0:13:24,436 --> 0:13:28,406
As you may know, Penny
is a Michigan graduate


231
0:13:28,406 --> 0:13:30,416
who with her husband, Roe,


232
0:13:30,416 --> 0:13:34,226
has made a historic 32
million dollar investment


233
0:13:34,226 --> 0:13:37,6
in the School of Art and Design.


234
0:13:37,6 --> 0:13:39,686
Their generosity
is wide-ranging--


235
0:13:39,686 --> 0:13:44,56
supporting student scholarships,
as well as global experiences,


236
0:13:44,56 --> 0:13:48,306
visiting artists and designers,
and community programs.


237
0:13:48,306 --> 0:13:51,106
Art and design schools
are sometimes overlooked,


238
0:13:51,106 --> 0:13:52,636
but not here.


239
0:13:52,636 --> 0:13:55,26
Penny was on campus
a few weeks ago,


240
0:13:55,26 --> 0:13:57,316
and was so enthusiastic
about this gift.


241
0:13:57,316 --> 0:14:1,546
It is a magnificent
feeling, she said,


242
0:14:1,546 --> 0:14:5,316
not only because she loves
supporting the creative process,


243
0:14:5,316 --> 0:14:9,776
but because the Stamps School
is "not just an art school."


244
0:14:9,776 --> 0:14:13,246
It's part of a major
research institution.


245
0:14:13,246 --> 0:14:17,326
That is what gives the School
of Music, Theatre and Dance,


246
0:14:17,326 --> 0:14:19,866
the Stamps School and
all of our schools


247
0:14:19,866 --> 0:14:23,746
and colleges their strength,
the combined expertise


248
0:14:23,746 --> 0:14:28,26
and creativity of
so many disciplines.


249
0:14:28,26 --> 0:14:29,666
Indeed, the pursuit of arts


250
0:14:29,666 --> 0:14:32,946
at Michigan is not a
stand-alone enterprise.


251
0:14:32,946 --> 0:14:36,936
It's not about decoration,
it's about creation--


252
0:14:36,936 --> 0:14:38,976
creation that is deeply rooted


253
0:14:38,976 --> 0:14:41,396
in our interdisciplinary
setting.


254
0:14:41,396 --> 0:14:45,366
It is this distinction
that sets us apart.


255
0:14:45,366 --> 0:14:49,986
When the Stamps School underwent
reaccreditation a few years ago,


256
0:14:49,986 --> 0:14:53,706
it drew high praise
from the visiting team.


257
0:14:53,706 --> 0:14:57,256
Michigan, they said,
is getting it right.


258
0:14:57,256 --> 0:15:1,966
To quote, "The School of Art
and Design and the University


259
0:15:1,966 --> 0:15:4,936
of Michigan have
created an opportunity


260
0:15:4,936 --> 0:15:8,246
to lead the academic
conversation in art


261
0:15:8,246 --> 0:15:9,966
and design in this country."


262
0:15:9,966 --> 0:15:13,676
We want to drive
the conversation


263
0:15:13,676 --> 0:15:16,96
in other areas, too.


264
0:15:16,96 --> 0:15:19,236
This month, the University
is surveying members


265
0:15:19,236 --> 0:15:22,526
of our community
about sustainability.


266
0:15:22,526 --> 0:15:25,626
We want to learn how
people think and behave


267
0:15:25,626 --> 0:15:28,106
when it comes to
the environment.


268
0:15:28,106 --> 0:15:31,396
By scientifically measuring
and reporting our behavior


269
0:15:31,396 --> 0:15:34,826
as a community, we can
work to make changes


270
0:15:34,826 --> 0:15:37,256
for the better of the planet.


271
0:15:37,256 --> 0:15:39,926
We know of no other university


272
0:15:39,926 --> 0:15:43,186
that is studying
itself in this way.


273
0:15:43,186 --> 0:15:46,366
This survey will
take place every year


274
0:15:46,366 --> 0:15:48,896
and will provide an
objective barometer


275
0:15:48,896 --> 0:15:51,636
of our sustainability culture.


276
0:15:51,636 --> 0:15:54,696
I announced this survey
a year ago as part


277
0:15:54,696 --> 0:15:58,866
of a broader sustainability
initiative for the University.


278
0:15:58,866 --> 0:16:3,26
Since then, we have launched
the Dow Scholars initiative,


279
0:16:3,26 --> 0:16:6,926
an unprecedented program
for 300 graduate students


280
0:16:6,926 --> 0:16:12,46
that accelerates how we teach
and research sustainability.


281
0:16:12,46 --> 0:16:15,466
This focus has evolved and
strengthened in recent years,


282
0:16:15,466 --> 0:16:18,526
with early support from
donors such as Dow,


283
0:16:18,526 --> 0:16:21,706
Don Graham and John Erb.


284
0:16:21,706 --> 0:16:25,516
They have shown what it means
to commit to sustainability


285
0:16:25,516 --> 0:16:30,396
at the very core of personal
and institutional values.


286
0:16:30,396 --> 0:16:34,746
John Erb, who is with us
this morning, recently asked


287
0:16:34,746 --> 0:16:37,136
where I want to see the
University of Michigan


288
0:16:37,136 --> 0:16:42,76
in the realm of sustainability
10, 20, 30 years from now.


289
0:16:42,76 --> 0:16:45,216
I have been thinking
a lot about that


290
0:16:45,216 --> 0:16:49,966
as we set aspirational goals
for Michigan's leadership.


291
0:16:49,966 --> 0:16:54,426
I know, we all know, that
we'll need to do a better job


292
0:16:54,426 --> 0:16:57,786
of building facilities,
affecting human behavior


293
0:16:57,786 --> 0:17:2,36
and consumption, and
challenging our energy usage,


294
0:17:2,36 --> 0:17:5,916
even as we manage the world's
largest public university


295
0:17:5,916 --> 0:17:8,516
research portfolio.


296
0:17:8,516 --> 0:17:12,406
But also, we must see the
University as a global leader


297
0:17:12,406 --> 0:17:17,256
in educating a new vanguard
of sustainability experts.


298
0:17:17,256 --> 0:17:20,36
It is here, on this campus,


299
0:17:20,36 --> 0:17:23,246
where tomorrow's sustainability
leaders will build their


300
0:17:23,246 --> 0:17:26,676
knowledge broadly,
across the disciplines,


301
0:17:26,676 --> 0:17:31,116
and carry that into the
world of policy and practice.


302
0:17:31,116 --> 0:17:33,606
We should be known
as the university


303
0:17:33,606 --> 0:17:38,266
with sustainability research,
curriculum and opportunities


304
0:17:38,266 --> 0:17:41,286
that make a real difference.


305
0:17:41,286 --> 0:17:43,946
In that spirit, today
I'm pleased


306
0:17:43,946 --> 0:17:46,986
to announce the establishment
of the University


307
0:17:46,986 --> 0:17:49,566
of Michigan Water Center.


308
0:17:49,566 --> 0:17:53,906
With the support of the
Erb Family Foundation,


309
0:17:53,906 --> 0:17:56,456
this is a new 9 million
dollar commitment


310
0:17:56,456 --> 0:17:58,836
to the Great Lakes region.


311
0:17:58,836 --> 0:18:2,766
We will focus on
four critical areas:


312
0:18:2,766 --> 0:18:7,846
reducing toxic contamination,
fighting invasive species,


313
0:18:7,846 --> 0:18:11,476
protecting wildlife habitat,


314
0:18:11,476 --> 0:18:14,756
and promoting the
health of the coastlines.


315
0:18:14,756 --> 0:18:18,76
The University of
Michigan has a long history


316
0:18:18,76 --> 0:18:20,606
of freshwater research.


317
0:18:20,606 --> 0:18:24,216
More than a century ago,
our scientists were working


318
0:18:24,216 --> 0:18:26,946
to determine why the
whitefish population was


319
0:18:26,946 --> 0:18:29,716
down in Lake Saint Clair.


320
0:18:29,716 --> 0:18:33,916
Today, the Great Lakes are
a source of food, recreation


321
0:18:33,916 --> 0:18:37,406
and jobs-- some 1 and
a half million jobs


322
0:18:37,406 --> 0:18:40,916
that carry 62 billion
dollar in yearly wages.


323
0:18:40,916 --> 0:18:45,566
If you were to look for a
country with a higher GDP


324
0:18:45,566 --> 0:18:48,596
than the Great Lakes
region, there are only two:


325
0:18:48,596 --> 0:18:53,26
the United States and China.


326
0:18:53,26 --> 0:18:56,786
As a university, we need to take
on ownership and responsibility


327
0:18:56,786 --> 0:19:0,896
of regional sustainability
challenges that affect us--


328
0:19:0,896 --> 0:19:4,176
close to home and where
our expertise can have


329
0:19:4,176 --> 0:19:6,176
enormous impact.


330
0:19:6,176 --> 0:19:8,66
The Water Center will do that.


331
0:19:8,66 --> 0:19:12,126
I want to thank John Erb
and his family foundation


332
0:19:12,126 --> 0:19:16,436
for supporting our work and
for continually pushing us


333
0:19:16,436 --> 0:19:18,576
to do more.


334
0:19:18,576 --> 0:19:21,936
The Great Lakes hold one-fifth


335
0:19:21,936 --> 0:19:25,256
of the world's freshwater
supply.


336
0:19:25,256 --> 0:19:27,416
One-fifth.


337
0:19:27,416 --> 0:19:30,376
Compromise their
health and integrity,


338
0:19:30,376 --> 0:19:34,556
and the damage will be
felt far beyond our shores.


339
0:19:34,556 --> 0:19:36,976
Which is why it's so critical


340
0:19:36,976 --> 0:19:40,26
to pursue not only
local partnerships,


341
0:19:40,26 --> 0:19:42,386
but international ones--


342
0:19:42,386 --> 0:19:45,386
relationships that pull
together different perspectives


343
0:19:45,386 --> 0:19:49,516
to tackle the world's
toughest challenges.


344
0:19:49,516 --> 0:19:56,466
[ Pause ]


345
0:19:56,466 --> 0:20:1,826
Doing more-- more research, more
service, more collaboration--


346
0:20:1,826 --> 0:20:4,706
means being more global.


347
0:20:4,706 --> 0:20:8,586
Eighty years ago, when Raoul
Wallenberg was a Michigan


348
0:20:8,586 --> 0:20:12,596
student, he absolutely
relished new people


349
0:20:12,596 --> 0:20:14,626
and different cultures.


350
0:20:14,626 --> 0:20:18,716
As an international student
from Sweden, he visited Detroit,


351
0:20:18,716 --> 0:20:22,516
New York, Chicago
and New Orleans.


352
0:20:22,516 --> 0:20:26,196
He and a classmate drove
to Mexico one summer.


353
0:20:26,196 --> 0:20:29,306
Another summer he
hitchhiked to California,


354
0:20:29,306 --> 0:20:33,336
and on up into Canada, and
then thumbed his way back


355
0:20:33,336 --> 0:20:35,96
to Ann Arbor.


356
0:20:35,96 --> 0:20:39,726
He called his travels "training
in diplomacy and tact."


357
0:20:39,726 --> 0:20:42,846
Now, the parent in me does
not condone hitchhiking.


358
0:20:42,846 --> 0:20:45,726
But as university president,


359
0:20:45,726 --> 0:20:48,736
I strongly endorse more
global opportunities


360
0:20:48,736 --> 0:20:51,606
for our students and faculty.


361
0:20:51,606 --> 0:20:53,486
Just yesterday we learned


362
0:20:53,486 --> 0:20:56,246
that Michigan students
lead the nation


363
0:20:56,246 --> 0:20:58,566
in this year's Fulbright grants.


364
0:20:58,566 --> 0:21:1,296
I should say, once again
we lead the nation.


365
0:21:1,296 --> 0:21:5,136
For the sixth time in
the past eight years.


366
0:21:5,136 --> 0:21:7,906
Fulbrights support global study


367
0:21:7,906 --> 0:21:10,506
and are among the
world's most competitive


368
0:21:10,506 --> 0:21:12,996
and prestigious programs.


369
0:21:12,996 --> 0:21:16,716
I'm thinking they're becoming
somewhat routine here though.


370
0:21:16,716 --> 0:21:21,516
But, of course, no international
experience is ordinary.


371
0:21:21,516 --> 0:21:23,436
Consider Brazil.


372
0:21:23,436 --> 0:21:24,996
My recent trip there


373
0:21:24,996 --> 0:21:28,316
with a faculty delegation
provides fertile territory


374
0:21:28,316 --> 0:21:31,546
for our work as a university.


375
0:21:31,546 --> 0:21:34,656
The country has seen
enormous economic progress


376
0:21:34,656 --> 0:21:39,436
in the past 20 years and
its vibrancy is palpable.


377
0:21:39,436 --> 0:21:42,466
Both federal and state
governments are investing


378
0:21:42,466 --> 0:21:45,736
heavily in education
and in advancing science


379
0:21:45,736 --> 0:21:48,476
and technology, and
are developing ways


380
0:21:48,476 --> 0:21:51,86
to move the previously
disadvantaged


381
0:21:51,86 --> 0:21:53,226
into the middle class.


382
0:21:53,226 --> 0:21:56,336
I anticipate exciting
collaborations resulting


383
0:21:56,336 --> 0:21:59,406
from our conversations
throughout Brazil.


384
0:21:59,406 --> 0:22:1,916
And several members of the
delegation are with us today,


385
0:22:1,916 --> 0:22:4,446
and I want them to raise their
hands so that you can see


386
0:22:4,446 --> 0:22:6,446
who went with me to Brazil.


387
0:22:6,446 --> 0:22:10,626
Got a couple up here, Gary
and Don, raise your hands.


388
0:22:10,626 --> 0:22:15,476
I want everyone to know how
expertly the University was


389
0:22:15,476 --> 0:22:16,676
represented on this trip.


390
0:22:16,676 --> 0:22:22,446
Our discussions fell into three
categories: medicine and health,


391
0:22:22,446 --> 0:22:25,566
humanities and social
sciences, environment


392
0:22:25,566 --> 0:22:27,736
and natural resources.


393
0:22:27,736 --> 0:22:30,906
At the University of
Sao Paulo, for example,


394
0:22:30,906 --> 0:22:33,336
there was intense
interest in how we


395
0:22:33,336 --> 0:22:37,396
as a university are
addressing sustainability.


396
0:22:37,396 --> 0:22:40,356
The Brazilian government is
making impressive investments


397
0:22:40,356 --> 0:22:44,476
in education with a bold new
scholarship program called


398
0:22:44,476 --> 0:22:46,376
Science Without Borders.


399
0:22:46,376 --> 0:22:51,426
The goal is to educate 100,000
students by sending them abroad


400
0:22:51,426 --> 0:22:52,916
for a year of study,


401
0:22:52,916 --> 0:22:55,546
specifically in STEM
disciplines.


402
0:22:55,546 --> 0:22:59,516
That's science, technology,
engineering and math.


403
0:22:59,516 --> 0:23:3,286
Brazil wants to achieve
this goal by 2015.


404
0:23:3,286 --> 0:23:7,206
At the moment, there are
1,000 students in the program,


405
0:23:7,206 --> 0:23:9,696
so you can see the challenges.


406
0:23:9,696 --> 0:23:13,626
But it is one that leaders
are willing to pursue.


407
0:23:13,626 --> 0:23:16,776
Brazil wants half of
these students-- 50,000--


408
0:23:16,776 --> 0:23:20,776
to attend college here, in the
United States, and our embassy


409
0:23:20,776 --> 0:23:25,556
in Brasilia is trying to help
with this very complex goal.


410
0:23:25,556 --> 0:23:28,576
We were able to meet with
the US ambassador and,


411
0:23:28,576 --> 0:23:32,266
since we now better understand
the issues, I'm confident


412
0:23:32,266 --> 0:23:35,476
that we can respond
in positive ways.


413
0:23:35,476 --> 0:23:39,516
We currently have five
undergraduate students enrolled


414
0:23:39,516 --> 0:23:42,876
with us in the Science
Without Borders program.


415
0:23:42,876 --> 0:23:45,236
They are with us, and I'd
like ask them to stand,


416
0:23:45,236 --> 0:23:49,396
our Science Without
Border students.


417
0:23:49,396 --> 0:23:52,906
Those who are here, thank
you so much for being here.


418
0:23:52,906 --> 0:23:57,416
I look forward to welcoming
more students in the future.


419
0:23:57,416 --> 0:23:59,516
These students strengthen
Michigan.


420
0:23:59,516 --> 0:24:7,656
[ Applause ]


421
0:24:7,656 --> 0:24:10,536
These students strengthen
Michigan with their ideas


422
0:24:10,536 --> 0:24:13,746
and perspectives,
their experiences.


423
0:24:13,746 --> 0:24:19,466
They demonstrate why we must,
absolutely must, pursue true,


424
0:24:19,466 --> 0:24:21,576
bilateral partnerships--


425
0:24:21,576 --> 0:24:25,496
to succeed and thrive
as a great institution.


426
0:24:25,496 --> 0:24:30,96
As one university, we
don't have all the answers.


427
0:24:30,96 --> 0:24:33,696
But working together with
many, our potential takes


428
0:24:33,696 --> 0:24:37,406
on a totally new magnitude.


429
0:24:37,406 --> 0:24:40,436
Which is why we're partnering
with universities in China,


430
0:24:40,436 --> 0:24:44,136
Ghana and South Africa, and
why I'll lead a delegation


431
0:24:44,136 --> 0:24:46,426
to India next year.


432
0:24:46,426 --> 0:24:50,436
It's why we, as an institution,
are communicating in Spanish,


433
0:24:50,436 --> 0:24:53,96
Portuguese and Mandarin.


434
0:24:53,96 --> 0:24:56,596
We've joined Weibo,
China's version of Twitter,


435
0:24:56,596 --> 0:25:0,366
and are now considered the most
influential American university


436
0:25:0,366 --> 0:25:2,576
in that space.


437
0:25:2,576 --> 0:25:7,96
Global impact is why we chose to
be the first public university


438
0:25:7,96 --> 0:25:11,106
in Coursera, a massive
online learning community.


439
0:25:11,106 --> 0:25:14,846
And the key word
here is massive.


440
0:25:14,846 --> 0:25:19,16
More than 1.3 million people
worldwide are enrolled


441
0:25:19,16 --> 0:25:20,836
in courses.


442
0:25:20,836 --> 0:25:24,36
Michigan faculty are
teaching six classes,


443
0:25:24,36 --> 0:25:26,986
with a seventh planned
for January.


444
0:25:26,986 --> 0:25:30,336
Professor Gautam Kaul's
introductory finance course


445
0:25:30,336 --> 0:25:37,86
alone attracted a
staggering 133,000 students.


446
0:25:37,86 --> 0:25:40,666
These courses are free, and
they give us a way to connect


447
0:25:40,666 --> 0:25:44,856
with students, whether
in Michigan or Macedonia.


448
0:25:44,856 --> 0:25:47,176
Coursera fits neatly
with our public mission


449
0:25:47,176 --> 0:25:48,956
of sharing knowledge.


450
0:25:48,956 --> 0:25:52,396
We are also optimistic that
it will help transform our


451
0:25:52,396 --> 0:25:58,66
classroom pedagogy
on campus as well.


452
0:25:58,66 --> 0:26:4,116
Optimism is an equally critical
ingredient for new discoveries


453
0:26:4,116 --> 0:26:5,736
and technologies that spring


454
0:26:5,736 --> 0:26:9,746
from our laboratories,
clinics and studies.


455
0:26:9,746 --> 0:26:13,826
Research universities fervently
believe in improving the world,


456
0:26:13,826 --> 0:26:16,806
and we do so in diverse ways.


457
0:26:16,806 --> 0:26:19,516
Two months ago, the
world lost a pioneer


458
0:26:19,516 --> 0:26:22,346
with the passing
of Neil Armstrong.


459
0:26:22,346 --> 0:26:25,236
His walk on the moon
was truly one


460
0:26:25,236 --> 0:26:28,496
of the monumental achievements
in science innovation--


461
0:26:28,496 --> 0:26:31,156
not only in this
country, but anywhere.


462
0:26:31,156 --> 0:26:34,396
Think of the research, the
creativity and the hard work


463
0:26:34,396 --> 0:26:37,476
that went into Apollo 11.


464
0:26:37,476 --> 0:26:41,306
NASA, industry, universities
and others came together


465
0:26:41,306 --> 0:26:44,66
with their research
and their inventions.


466
0:26:44,66 --> 0:26:45,936
It was the ultimate embodiment


467
0:26:45,936 --> 0:26:49,366
of American innovation
and collaboration.


468
0:26:49,366 --> 0:26:52,446
Now also think of
this, the computers


469
0:26:52,446 --> 0:26:57,986
on Apollo 11 had less processing
power than your smartphone.


470
0:26:57,986 --> 0:27:2,856
This is why we continually
innovate, invent and educate.


471
0:27:2,856 --> 0:27:4,646
To discover new knowledge.


472
0:27:4,646 --> 0:27:9,746
To move forward as a nation
and a global community.


473
0:27:9,746 --> 0:27:12,6
Michigan's research
portfolio stands


474
0:27:12,6 --> 0:27:16,826
at 1.27 billion dollars--
billion.


475
0:27:16,826 --> 0:27:20,696
That exceeds the
entire budget of Monaco.


476
0:27:20,696 --> 0:27:26,196
No public university in the
world invests more in research.


477
0:27:26,196 --> 0:27:29,486
It's research that is
more relevant than ever.


478
0:27:29,486 --> 0:27:31,246
We are now the first university


479
0:27:31,246 --> 0:27:35,286
to lead an entire
satellite launch program,


480
0:27:35,286 --> 0:27:39,906
a 52 million dollar venture
entrusted to us by NASA.


481
0:27:39,906 --> 0:27:43,576
This project is designed to
better understand hurricanes,


482
0:27:43,576 --> 0:27:46,146
which results in more
accurate storm predictions and,


483
0:27:46,146 --> 0:27:48,836
ultimately, lives saved.


484
0:27:48,836 --> 0:27:53,246
Hurricane Sandy is showing us
the importance of forecasting,


485
0:27:53,246 --> 0:27:54,706
and it's gratifying to know


486
0:27:54,706 --> 0:27:56,886
that our scientists
will contribute even


487
0:27:56,886 --> 0:27:59,256
more refinements.


488
0:27:59,256 --> 0:28:2,626
We also see lives being saved
with a new research project


489
0:28:2,626 --> 0:28:6,576
that has thousands of vehicles
throughout Ann Arbor using


490
0:28:6,576 --> 0:28:8,616
technology to communicate
with each other.


491
0:28:8,616 --> 0:28:12,586
With the support of 22 million
dollars from the Department


492
0:28:12,586 --> 0:28:16,326
of Transportation, this
technology is alerting drivers


493
0:28:16,326 --> 0:28:18,256
to trouble on the road.


494
0:28:18,256 --> 0:28:23,506
It may well lead to an 80
percent reduction in crashes.


495
0:28:23,506 --> 0:28:25,286
That's impact.


496
0:28:25,286 --> 0:28:28,566
Our health system,
including University Hospital


497
0:28:28,566 --> 0:28:31,906
and Mott Children's Hospital
continues to be among the best


498
0:28:31,906 --> 0:28:33,256
and safest in the country.


499
0:28:33,256 --> 0:28:36,426
We have been selected
as the home


500
0:28:36,426 --> 0:28:39,756
for a new 21 million dollar
federally funded center


501
0:28:39,756 --> 0:28:42,256
for HIV research.


502
0:28:42,256 --> 0:28:44,346
The University's
two largest grants


503
0:28:44,346 --> 0:28:45,626
from the National Institutes


504
0:28:45,626 --> 0:28:48,506
of Health support the
Comprehensive Cancer Center


505
0:28:48,506 --> 0:28:52,906
and the Michigan Institute for
Clinical and Health Research.


506
0:28:52,906 --> 0:28:55,166
Both were renewed this year,


507
0:28:55,166 --> 0:28:58,746
with glowing comments
from the NIH.


508
0:28:58,746 --> 0:29:2,616
The North Campus Research
Complex is attracting more


509
0:29:2,616 --> 0:29:4,686
people and programs.


510
0:29:4,686 --> 0:29:7,786
This includes the new
Institute for Healthcare Policy


511
0:29:7,786 --> 0:29:11,636
and Innovation and more than
400 researchers committed


512
0:29:11,636 --> 0:29:14,666
to promoting high-quality,
equitable


513
0:29:14,666 --> 0:29:17,716
and affordable health
care services.


514
0:29:17,716 --> 0:29:20,276
We believe the Institute
will be the largest


515
0:29:20,276 --> 0:29:22,656
in the country for such work.


516
0:29:22,656 --> 0:29:26,26
Today, we are announcing
the first director,


517
0:29:26,26 --> 0:29:30,136
Dr. John Ayanian, a highly
respected researcher we've


518
0:29:30,136 --> 0:29:32,946
attracted from the Michigan
of the East, Harvard.


519
0:29:32,946 --> 0:29:34,396
So, John, would you
stand a minute just


520
0:29:34,396 --> 0:29:36,516
for people to welcome you.


521
0:29:36,516 --> 0:29:41,96
[ Applause ]


522
0:29:41,96 --> 0:29:47,436
His expertise will give
IHPI national prominence


523
0:29:47,436 --> 0:29:51,6
and help us recruit
even more top experts.


524
0:29:51,6 --> 0:29:54,366
Dr. Ayanian is on campus
this week and I'm thrilled


525
0:29:54,366 --> 0:29:55,426
that he's here with us.


526
0:29:55,426 --> 0:29:57,496
I mean just introduced him, so.


527
0:29:57,496 --> 0:29:59,836
John needs to be at the
Michigan Union shortly


528
0:29:59,836 --> 0:30:3,126
to welcome a summit of
national health care leaders,


529
0:30:3,126 --> 0:30:5,136
and I really appreciate
he's spending time


530
0:30:5,136 --> 0:30:7,576
with us this morning.


531
0:30:7,576 --> 0:30:12,286
The Michigan passion for
entrepreneurship is flourishing.


532
0:30:12,286 --> 0:30:15,526
Our scientists are declaring a
record number of inventions more


533
0:30:15,526 --> 0:30:18,76
than one a day this past year.


534
0:30:18,76 --> 0:30:23,346
The Venture Accelerator, based
at the NCRC, is officially full


535
0:30:23,346 --> 0:30:28,596
with 18 startup companies built
on U-M research discoveries.


536
0:30:28,596 --> 0:30:31,666
We thought that the Accelerator
would take three years to fill,


537
0:30:31,666 --> 0:30:34,986
and it took less
than half that time.


538
0:30:34,986 --> 0:30:38,326
Students are enrolled in our
first class of candidates


539
0:30:38,326 --> 0:30:40,966
for the master's degree
on entrepreneurship.


540
0:30:40,966 --> 0:30:42,316
Here at the Ross School,


541
0:30:42,316 --> 0:30:44,546
the Zell-Lurie Institute
is ranked second


542
0:30:44,546 --> 0:30:47,286
in the country among
top graduate programs


543
0:30:47,286 --> 0:30:49,336
for entrepreneurship.


544
0:30:49,336 --> 0:30:52,806
The ZEAL clinic is up and
running, connecting law students


545
0:30:52,806 --> 0:30:56,536
with student entrepreneurs
in need of legal counsel.


546
0:30:56,536 --> 0:31:0,896
Faculty are beating down the
doors to participate in MCubed,


547
0:31:0,896 --> 0:31:2,186
our new funding program


548
0:31:2,186 --> 0:31:5,516
that connects researchers
across campus.


549
0:31:5,516 --> 0:31:8,116
We are committing
15 million dollars


550
0:31:8,116 --> 0:31:13,306
to some 250 team projects
that are admittedly high-risk,


551
0:31:13,306 --> 0:31:16,626
but also, potentially,
very rewarding.


552
0:31:16,626 --> 0:31:20,896
MCubed has grown out of our
Third Century Initiative,


553
0:31:20,896 --> 0:31:23,776
a 50 million dollar investment
in teaching and research


554
0:31:23,776 --> 0:31:26,156
that we announced a year ago.


555
0:31:26,156 --> 0:31:27,836
This is a commitment taking us


556
0:31:27,836 --> 0:31:30,536
up to the University's
bicentennial,


557
0:31:30,536 --> 0:31:34,726
and a third century
of creative thinking.


558
0:31:34,726 --> 0:31:38,776
We want to know, what are the
different ways the University


559
0:31:38,776 --> 0:31:42,686
can address the world's greatest
challenges and opportunities?


560
0:31:42,686 --> 0:31:46,126
What types of immersive learning
experiences can we create


561
0:31:46,126 --> 0:31:48,56
for our students?


562
0:31:48,56 --> 0:31:51,496
We are eager to fund
innovative answers.


563
0:31:51,496 --> 0:31:52,956
And beginning next month,


564
0:31:52,956 --> 0:31:55,666
the Provost's Office
will be asking you,


565
0:31:55,666 --> 0:31:59,226
the members of our
community, for your best ideas.


566
0:31:59,226 --> 0:32:4,466
When we talk about
innovation and creativity,


567
0:32:4,466 --> 0:32:9,586
we know that Michigan staff
are essential to this culture.


568
0:32:9,586 --> 0:32:11,526
We see it in Planet Blue,


569
0:32:11,526 --> 0:32:15,376
with Voices of the
Staff, and with MHealthy.


570
0:32:15,376 --> 0:32:17,126
Today, I'm pleased to announce


571
0:32:17,126 --> 0:32:20,76
that we will recognize the
creative staff contributions


572
0:32:20,76 --> 0:32:23,456
with a new Presidential
Innovation Award.


573
0:32:23,456 --> 0:32:28,356
With both words and dollars, we
will honor individuals and teams


574
0:32:28,356 --> 0:32:32,916
for ideas that make Michigan a
better place to work and live.


575
0:32:32,916 --> 0:32:36,46
The Chronicle of Higher
Education consistently ranks


576
0:32:36,46 --> 0:32:38,126
and recognizes this
campus as one


577
0:32:38,126 --> 0:32:41,16
of the best university
workplaces.


578
0:32:41,16 --> 0:32:42,866
It happened again this summer


579
0:32:42,866 --> 0:32:47,426
and Michigan staff helped
create that climate.


580
0:32:47,426 --> 0:32:50,676
That Michigan is an
invigorating place to live,


581
0:32:50,676 --> 0:32:55,626
learn and work has been
known by generations.


582
0:32:55,626 --> 0:32:58,106
When Raoul Wallenberg
was winding


583
0:32:58,106 --> 0:33:2,866
down his time here,
he wanted to stay.


584
0:33:2,866 --> 0:33:7,306
"I feel so at home in my little
Ann Arbor that I'm beginning


585
0:33:7,306 --> 0:33:9,866
to sink down roots here,


586
0:33:9,866 --> 0:33:14,686
and I have a hard time
imagining leaving it."


587
0:33:14,686 --> 0:33:19,846
But, he observed, "I'm not doing
anything very useful here."


588
0:33:19,846 --> 0:33:22,746
Isn't that what we
want from our students?


589
0:33:22,746 --> 0:33:25,746
To have an amazing
experience here,


590
0:33:25,746 --> 0:33:28,86
but know that their
real value is


591
0:33:28,86 --> 0:33:33,6
when they apply their
lessons and move on?


592
0:33:33,6 --> 0:33:36,926
Could Raoul Wallenberg have
envisioned the horror of war


593
0:33:36,926 --> 0:33:39,756
and the heroics he would
display in World War II?


594
0:33:39,756 --> 0:33:42,386
Of course not.


595
0:33:42,386 --> 0:33:46,176
But he knew the importance
of taking Michigan with him,


596
0:33:46,176 --> 0:33:50,806
because the lessons would
help shape the future.


597
0:33:50,806 --> 0:33:55,216
Just how deeply is evidenced
with us this morning.


598
0:33:55,216 --> 0:33:59,186
Irene Butter and Andrew
Nagy are emeritus faculty,


599
0:33:59,186 --> 0:34:3,516
and I want them to
stand for a minute.


600
0:34:3,516 --> 0:34:11,76
[ Applause ]


601
0:34:11,76 --> 0:34:15,546
Professors Butter and Nagy
devoted more than 85 years


602
0:34:15,546 --> 0:34:19,156
of combined teaching,
research and service.


603
0:34:19,156 --> 0:34:22,586
Dr. Butter was a professor in
the School of Public Health


604
0:34:22,586 --> 0:34:25,736
and helped write our
state's Public Health Code.


605
0:34:25,736 --> 0:34:30,116
Dr. Nagy is a space scientist
with the College of Engineering


606
0:34:30,116 --> 0:34:33,696
who was involved in
numerous NASA projects.


607
0:34:33,696 --> 0:34:36,136
But long before they
were scholars,


608
0:34:36,136 --> 0:34:39,396
they were scared
Jewish teenagers living


609
0:34:39,396 --> 0:34:44,796
through the Holocaust, she
in Holland and he in Hungary.


610
0:34:44,796 --> 0:34:48,846
Each survived, though members
of their families did not.


611
0:34:48,846 --> 0:34:53,116
Professor Nagy was saved
by Raoul Wallenberg.


612
0:34:53,116 --> 0:34:57,46
As Holocaust survivors and
members of our community,


613
0:34:57,46 --> 0:35:1,286
these two scholars have
dedicated themselves


614
0:35:1,286 --> 0:35:5,386
to the humanitarian spirit
with their longtime service


615
0:35:5,386 --> 0:35:9,996
to the University and the
Wallenberg Lecture and Medal.


616
0:35:9,996 --> 0:35:15,986
The Wallenberg Medal honors
compassionate, global work,


617
0:35:15,986 --> 0:35:20,376
and past recipients have
included Elie Wiesel, John Lewis


618
0:35:20,376 --> 0:35:24,306
and Nobel laureate
Aung San Suu Kyi.


619
0:35:24,306 --> 0:35:29,316
Just last week, one of our past
honorees, Dr. Denis Mukwege,


620
0:35:29,316 --> 0:35:35,56
was the target of assassins
because of his tireless mission


621
0:35:35,56 --> 0:35:38,566
to save rape victims
in the Congo.


622
0:35:38,566 --> 0:35:41,776
The words on the
Wallenberg Medal are direct,


623
0:35:41,776 --> 0:35:44,846
one person can make
a difference.


624
0:35:44,846 --> 0:35:48,6
Professors Butter and
Nagy, you have done just


625
0:35:48,6 --> 0:35:51,246
that with your scholarship
and your dedication


626
0:35:51,246 --> 0:35:52,726
to the Wallenberg legacy.


627
0:35:52,726 --> 0:35:53,516
Thank you.


628
0:35:53,516 --> 0:36:10,86
[ Applause ]


629
0:36:10,86 --> 0:36:14,646
Today, in the 100th year of
his birth, we will do more


630
0:36:14,646 --> 0:36:17,886
to promote the spirit
of Raoul Wallenberg.


631
0:36:17,886 --> 0:36:20,776
I'm thrilled to announce
the establishment


632
0:36:20,776 --> 0:36:25,336
of the Raoul Wallenberg
Fellowship for undergraduates.


633
0:36:25,336 --> 0:36:29,856
This is a new 25,000
dollar stipend to be awarded


634
0:36:29,856 --> 0:36:31,266
to a graduating senior


635
0:36:31,266 --> 0:36:35,246
who demonstrates deep
commitment to selfless work.


636
0:36:35,246 --> 0:36:39,786
We want to help a new graduate
dedicate the first year of his


637
0:36:39,786 --> 0:36:43,146
or her life path
to this calling.


638
0:36:43,146 --> 0:36:46,326
It will now be among the
University's largest prizes


639
0:36:46,326 --> 0:36:48,36
for undergraduates.


640
0:36:48,36 --> 0:36:50,486
Its name carries
great importance


641
0:36:50,486 --> 0:36:53,126
and even greater expectations.


642
0:36:53,126 --> 0:36:56,416
And we will begin with
a graduating senior


643
0:36:56,416 --> 0:36:59,666
from the class of 2013.


644
0:36:59,666 --> 0:37:3,926
Surely Raoul Wallenberg
did not graduate intending


645
0:37:3,926 --> 0:37:7,876
to become an international
symbol of moral courage.


646
0:37:7,876 --> 0:37:11,106
But his remarkable deeds
provide inspiration


647
0:37:11,106 --> 0:37:15,696
for today's Michigan students,
and this new award will serve


648
0:37:15,696 --> 0:37:21,266
to encourage careers
dedicated to human rights.


649
0:37:21,266 --> 0:37:25,676
Let me close with one
last Wallenberg snapshot.


650
0:37:25,676 --> 0:37:30,426
He's just completed his final
exams and his freshman year.


651
0:37:30,426 --> 0:37:34,226
In a letter home, he tells
of staying up all night,


652
0:37:34,226 --> 0:37:37,46
studying chemistry with friends.


653
0:37:37,46 --> 0:37:40,306
It's not his best
subject and he knows it.


654
0:37:40,306 --> 0:37:42,716
He is thoroughly exhausted.


655
0:37:42,716 --> 0:37:45,626
And still, he says,
it's been worth it.


656
0:37:45,626 --> 0:37:46,796
He's made friends.


657
0:37:46,796 --> 0:37:48,536
He enjoys college.


658
0:37:48,536 --> 0:37:51,866
Not so much of good grade,
because of good grades,


659
0:37:51,866 --> 0:37:56,546
but rather, "Because I feel like
that I have learned something."


660
0:37:56,546 --> 0:37:59,646
This is our mission
as a great university.


661
0:37:59,646 --> 0:38:3,366
That our students learn and
grow, evolve as leaders,


662
0:38:3,366 --> 0:38:6,656
and come to see themselves
in a different light.


663
0:38:6,656 --> 0:38:10,756
That our faculty and staff
teach and grow as well,


664
0:38:10,756 --> 0:38:13,96
changing people and places


665
0:38:13,96 --> 0:38:15,966
with their discoveries
and contributions.


666
0:38:15,966 --> 0:38:20,486
That we all believe we can
and will make a difference,


667
0:38:20,486 --> 0:38:24,206
as individuals, as an
academic community,


668
0:38:24,206 --> 0:38:27,626
dedicated to transforming
our state, our nation,


669
0:38:27,626 --> 0:38:31,776
our world with ideas
and actions.


670
0:38:31,776 --> 0:38:33,516
Thank you.


671
0:38:33,516 --> 0:39:3,476
[ Applause ]


672
0:39:3,476 --> 0:39:6,636
So now we just have a few
minutes and I'll be happy


673
0:39:6,636 --> 0:39:10,56
to answer any questions that you
might have, anything you might


674
0:39:10,56 --> 0:39:16,856
like to, to know about.


675
0:39:16,856 --> 0:39:22,456
Anyone? Hi Jim.


676
0:39:22,456 --> 0:39:36,946
>> Now we were talking
briefly at our table


677
0:39:36,946 --> 0:39:41,666
about the ballot proposals
that are facing Michigan voters


678
0:39:41,666 --> 0:39:44,976
and wondering if you
have any reflections


679
0:39:44,976 --> 0:39:46,976
on ballot questions
here in Michigan


680
0:39:46,976 --> 0:39:53,186
and their potential impact
upon the institution.


681
0:39:53,186 --> 0:39:57,666
>> Okay. Well, thanks for the
opportunity to give me another--


682
0:39:57,666 --> 0:40:2,956
to give me an opportunity
for another encouragement


683
0:40:2,956 --> 0:40:5,656
for people to go and vote.


684
0:40:5,656 --> 0:40:11,456
I sent out a message campus wide
just this morning encouraging


685
0:40:11,456 --> 0:40:14,936
you to make sure that you're
registered and make sure


686
0:40:14,936 --> 0:40:17,786
that you vote either in
person or by absentee ballot.


687
0:40:17,786 --> 0:40:19,936
This is-- there are a lot of
issues on the ballot this time,


688
0:40:19,936 --> 0:40:21,666
some state initiatives as
well as local initiatives.


689
0:40:21,666 --> 0:40:22,716
And I encourage you
to educate yourselves.


690
0:40:22,716 --> 0:40:24,336
There are several websites that
are listed in my e-mail to go


691
0:40:24,336 --> 0:40:25,746
and find out what these ballot
proposals are all about.


692
0:40:25,746 --> 0:40:27,216
Several of them will change
the constitution of the state


693
0:40:27,216 --> 0:40:28,746
and that's a serious issue and
I just encourage you to find


694
0:40:28,746 --> 0:40:30,6
out everything that you
can and please go and vote,


695
0:40:30,6 --> 0:40:31,416
it's very important
responsibility as a citizen.


696
0:40:31,416 --> 0:40:32,886
Well, thank you all very much
and I also want to say how--


697
0:40:32,886 --> 0:40:34,146
what a great privilege
it was to grab the speech


698
0:40:34,146 --> 0:40:35,346
around the centennial of
Raoul Wallenberg's birth.


699
0:40:35,346 --> 0:40:35,766
It's tremendous.


700
0:40:35,766 --> 0:40:36,516
Thank you.
