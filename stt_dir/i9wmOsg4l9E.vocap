###79 SHANE SMITH: War makes fucked up movies, and that is a
###82 fucked up movie.
###83 It's called "Divine Intervention." It's part of a
###85 new wave of Lebanese cinema that's coming out of the
###88 violence and the craziness and the terror that's been going
###90 on there for the past 40 years.
###96 Now there are a lot of different political factions
###98 within Lebanon, but we're going to be concentrating on
###100 the Palestinians, who are refugees.
###102 They are people without a state.
###103 And film has become the most important medium for them to
###106 get their message across.
###110 50 or 60 years ago, Beirut was much
###112 different than it is today.
###114 It was known as the Paris of the Middle East.
###116 It was the cultural center of the region.
###118 It was the artistic hub.
###121 But at the same time, this part of the world was
###123 radically altered with the establishment
###125 of Israel in 1948.
###129 The creation of Israel and the ensuing war caused the
###132 displacement of the Palestinian people into many
###135 neighboring Arab countries.
###136 But a lot of them settled in Lebanon in temporary camps and
###140 thought that they would soon be returning to their homes.
###142 But they're still there today.
###144 Three generations later, they still don't have a homeland.
###147 They are still refugees.
###148 They don't have passports.
###150 They can't work.
###151 And they're still living in the same camps.
###155 Today Israel believes that the Palestinian refugee camps are
###158 a breeding ground for terrorists and that militant
###161 groups like the Hezbollah hide their weapons within their
###164 communities.
###166 
###168 In 2006, Israel bombed Lebanon for a month in retaliation for
###172 Hezbollah's kidnapping of two of their soldiers.
###174 
###180 Some of what happened in Lebanon during the conflict
###183 was documented by civilians.
###184 In fact, the footage you're watching now is from a DVD
###188 that we bought on the streets of Beirut.

###223 SHANE SMITH: Instead of succumbing to hatred and
###225 violence, some young Palestinians have turned to
###227 film making as both a creative and a political outlet.
###231 And we're seeing fiction, we're seeing documentary, as
###235 an expression of what it's like to grow up in a constant
###238 state of conflict.

###289 SHANE SMITH: These films are happening with little to no
###290 funding, basic resources, but against all odds a small group
###294 of Palestinian filmmakers is emerging.
###298 Our first contact with Palestinian filmmakers was
###301 very personal.
###302 We had gone to Beirut to shoot "The Vice Guide to Travel." It
###305 was a story about a skate park that was
###307 sponsored by the Hezbollah.
###309 And while we were there, we met a Palestinian Boy Scout
###311 leader named Ahmad.
###313 And Ahmad lived in the Bourj al-Barajneh camp in Beirut.
###318 Eddie, our producer, went to Ahmad's house
###321 to interview him.
###322 And he found out that his dream
###325 was to become a filmmaker.
###326 
###348 EDDIE: So I wanted to stop here because of that poster.
###351 EDDIE: Oh, it's a photo that they painted?
###353 AHMAD: Yeah.
###354 
###370 EDDIE: How?
###370 They shot him?
###371 
###383 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###390 EDDIE: I saw some photos of you with a gun.
###392 AHMAD: Ah.
###395 EDDIE: [CHUCKLE].
###397 EDDIE: No.
###399 EDDIE: No.
###400 AHMAD: OK.
###401 
###419 EDDIE: Yes.
###421 
###450 EDDIE: You're suffering.
###452 Do you want this generation of children to be martyrs?
###455 You work with them every day.
###457 
###467 EDDIE: What's the next step?
###469 AHMAD: For me?
###470 EDDIE: Yeah.
###472 What can you do?
###474 AHMAD: I'm going to have a camera soon.
###477 SHANE SMITH: So we went to the camps, which are incredibly
###479 depressing.
###480 And the thought that Ahmad wanted to be a filmmaker, and
###484 that we had everything at our disposal to help him with
###486 that, after spending time with him and opening up his life to
###489 us, we decided that we would surprise him.
###492 And we gave him one of our cameras.
###495 AHMAD: As a Palestinian guy it's so difficult to get like
###499 a good camera.
###500 I promise I will use this camera for the peace, and for
###504 nice things.
