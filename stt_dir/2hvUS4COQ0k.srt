1
0:0:2,335 --> 0:0:5,18
All right, we've got everything.


2
0:0:5,18 --> 0:0:6,848
All I need it is my cooker with
the all-stars cookbook.


3
0:0:6,848 --> 0:0:8,516
- So, babe, what do you want
to make with it?


4
0:0:8,516 --> 0:0:9,851
Chicken?
Fish?


5
0:0:9,851 --> 0:0:11,986
- Everything goes with Shaq 'n cheese.


6
0:0:11,986 --> 0:0:13,621
- I don't know why you want
to come in here


7
0:0:13,621 --> 0:0:14,789
and mess up my kitchen.


8
0:0:14,789 --> 0:0:16,758
You haven't made anything
from that cookbook


9
0:0:16,758 --> 0:0:17,826
since your mom gave it to you


10
0:0:17,826 --> 0:0:19,527
two years ago for your birthday.


11
0:0:19,527 --> 0:0:21,95
- Mess up your kitchen?


12
0:0:21,95 --> 0:0:23,331
Remember those
Charles barkley biscuits?


13
0:0:23,331 --> 0:0:24,966
I put my foot in those.


14
0:0:24,966 --> 0:0:27,402
- But they tasted like you still
had your sock on.


15
0:0:27,402 --> 0:0:28,736
- Why you playin'?


16
0:0:28,736 --> 0:0:29,737
- No, come on, all right.


17
0:0:29,737 --> 0:0:31,5
I'll handle the meal,


18
0:0:31,5 --> 0:0:32,44
and you go fill out the paperwork


19
0:0:32,44 --> 0:0:33,441
for Kevin's school trip.


20
0:0:33,441 --> 0:0:35,777
- That hurt.
- I'm sorry.


21
0:0:35,777 --> 0:0:37,412
- You had said you liked them biscuits.


22
0:0:37,412 --> 0:0:40,815
- [Giggling]


23
0:0:40,815 --> 0:0:47,355
"Happy Birthday, hubby"?


24
0:0:47,355 --> 0:0:49,23
Nick?
Honey?


25
0:0:49,23 --> 0:0:50,91
- Yeah, babe?


26
0:0:50,91 --> 0:0:51,593
- Whatever happened to the gift card


27
0:0:51,593 --> 0:0:54,495
that I got you for your birthday
not this year but last?


28
0:0:54,495 --> 0:0:56,598
- Um, I got something for the computer.


29
0:0:56,598 --> 0:0:57,699
- Oh, what'd you get?


30
0:0:57,699 --> 0:0:59,67
- Memory.


31
0:0:59,67 --> 0:1:0,635
- Memory?
Where is it?


32
0:1:0,635 --> 0:1:2,47
- It's inside the computer.
It's a great gift.


33
0:1:2,47 --> 0:1:4,38
My computer never forgets anything.


34
0:1:4,38 --> 0:1:6,541
- Oh, okay, so you definitely
used the gift card.


35
0:1:6,541 --> 0:1:8,109
- Yeah.
Why?


36
0:1:8,109 --> 0:1:9,944
- I was thinking about
what I was gonna get you


37
0:1:9,944 --> 0:1:11,45
for your next birthday,


38
0:1:11,45 --> 0:1:13,47
and then I realized
that you never told me


39
0:1:13,47 --> 0:1:17,385
what I got you for that birthday
with the gift card.


40
0:1:17,385 --> 0:1:19,587
- Well, I distinctly remember it.


41
0:1:19,587 --> 0:1:22,423
You got me memory, so remember that.


42
0:1:22,423 --> 0:1:25,66
- Oh, I won't forget.


43
0:1:25,66 --> 0:1:27,95
- Anything else?
- No, that's it.


44
0:1:27,95 --> 0:1:28,96
- You sure?
- Yeah.


45
0:1:28,96 --> 0:1:29,33
- Okay.
- Thanks, honey.


46
0:1:29,33 --> 0:1:31,165
- Okay, baby.


47
0:1:31,165 --> 0:1:34,369
- Ram...
Mm-Hmm.


48
0:1:34,369 --> 0:1:36,337
I got your ram.

53
0:1:51,686 --> 0:1:53,154
- all right, so educate me.


54
0:1:53,154 --> 0:1:55,29
Why wouldn't you just tell her
you lost it?


55
0:1:55,29 --> 0:1:56,658
- Well, I didn't lose it.


56
0:1:56,658 --> 0:1:57,759
I misplaced it.


57
0:1:57,759 --> 0:1:59,93
It's here somewhere.


58
0:1:59,93 --> 0:2:1,162
- And that's not the same thing?


59
0:2:1,162 --> 0:2:4,65
- Nope, they have two completely
different definitions.


60
0:2:4,65 --> 0:2:5,967
- Oh, you mean like "innocent"
and "not guilty."


61
0:2:5,967 --> 0:2:7,802
Like, Nelson mandela was innocent.


62
0:2:7,802 --> 0:2:11,306
O.J., not guilty.


63
0:2:11,306 --> 0:2:13,374
Why don't you just
go buy another one then?


64
0:2:13,374 --> 0:2:15,76
- 'Cause I already told her I used it.


65
0:2:15,76 --> 0:2:16,477
And if she's asking about it,


66
0:2:16,477 --> 0:2:17,979
that means she's looking for it too.


67
0:2:17,979 --> 0:2:19,213
- Don't worry, dad.


68
0:2:19,213 --> 0:2:20,782
If it's in this house, we'll find it.


69
0:2:20,782 --> 0:2:22,65
- Yeah, me and Kevin
are gonna work this place


70
0:2:22,65 --> 0:2:24,986
like basketball wives at a purse sale.


71
0:2:24,986 --> 0:2:27,889
- Oh, now, that is the attitude
I am looking for, Troy.


72
0:2:27,889 --> 0:2:29,157
- All right, so what's the plan?


73
0:2:29,157 --> 0:2:32,193
- Okay, Kevin and Troy
are gonna take the top floor.


74
0:2:32,193 --> 0:2:34,996
I want you guys to search this
house from top to bottom.


75
0:2:34,996 --> 0:2:43,71
Leave no stone unturned.


76
0:2:43,71 --> 0:2:44,5
- We're back.


77
0:2:44,5 --> 0:2:46,14
Hey, dad.
Hey, Martin.


78
0:2:46,14 --> 0:2:49,11
- Hey, I thought you guys were
going to get something to eat.


79
0:2:49,11 --> 0:2:51,312
- We did.
- What happened here?


80
0:2:51,312 --> 0:2:52,313
- Nothing happened here.


81
0:2:52,313 --> 0:2:54,816
Weren't you going upstairs?


82
0:2:54,816 --> 0:2:58,186
- Hmm...
Did you lose something?


83
0:2:58,186 --> 0:3:0,421
- No, we were just
straightening up a little bit


84
0:3:0,421 --> 0:3:2,156
before you got back.


85
0:3:2,156 --> 0:3:3,558
- Oh, okay,


86
0:3:3,558 --> 0:3:7,161
'cause it was pretty straight
before I left.


87
0:3:7,161 --> 0:3:9,764
So what happened between now and then?


88
0:3:9,764 --> 0:3:10,798
- Nothing.


89
0:3:10,798 --> 0:3:11,866
We just thought


90
0:3:11,866 --> 0:3:13,568
we'd straighten up a little bit more.


91
0:3:13,568 --> 0:3:14,669
That's all.


92
0:3:14,669 --> 0:3:19,674
- <i>1,000 ways</i> <i>to love a black man,</i> nice.


93
0:3:19,674 --> 0:3:21,376
Something we need to discuss?


94
0:3:21,376 --> 0:3:23,811
- I was wondering,


95
0:3:23,811 --> 0:3:25,79
if I was a black man,


96
0:3:25,79 --> 0:3:27,482
what it would be like
if a woman wanted to love me


97
0:3:27,482 --> 0:3:28,483
a thousand ways.


98
0:3:28,483 --> 0:3:29,884
- Mm, okay.


99
0:3:29,884 --> 0:3:32,52
So you're sure you guys
aren't looking for anything?


100
0:3:32,52 --> 0:3:35,59
- No, why would we be looking
for something?


101
0:3:35,59 --> 0:3:36,924
- I'm not saying that you are.


102
0:3:36,924 --> 0:3:38,693
I'm just saying, if you were,


103
0:3:38,693 --> 0:3:41,262
I could always call somebody
to help you guys,


104
0:3:41,262 --> 0:3:44,365
you know, on my new phone.


105
0:3:44,365 --> 0:3:45,333
- Where'd you get that?


106
0:3:45,333 --> 0:3:46,801
- The electronics store.


107
0:3:46,801 --> 0:3:49,37
I didn't think I was gonna
be able to afford it,


108
0:3:49,37 --> 0:3:52,34
but then I found a $300 gift card.


109
0:3:52,34 --> 0:3:54,642
- Where?
- In a cookbook.


110
0:3:54,642 --> 0:3:56,611
You know, I thought it was yours,


111
0:3:56,611 --> 0:3:59,68
but you said
that you used yours to buy...


112
0:3:59,68 --> 0:4:1,649
What was it again?


113
0:4:1,649 --> 0:4:2,85
- Ram.


114
0:4:2,85 --> 0:4:5,253
- Ram!
That's right.


115
0:4:5,253 --> 0:4:6,854
- Okay.


116
0:4:6,854 --> 0:4:8,156
Oh, you're so cute.


117
0:4:8,156 --> 0:4:10,525
Look at you,
with that cute little smile.


118
0:4:10,525 --> 0:4:11,526
That's good.


119
0:4:11,526 --> 0:4:12,46
Hand it over.


120
0:4:12,46 --> 0:4:13,694
- Hand what over?
- My phone.


121
0:4:13,694 --> 0:4:15,63
- How is this your phone?


122
0:4:15,63 --> 0:4:16,564
- You bought it with my gift card.


123
0:4:16,564 --> 0:4:20,168
- Did he tell you
about losing a gift card?


124
0:4:20,168 --> 0:4:21,135
- Hey, look at this.


125
0:4:21,135 --> 0:4:23,805
The 436th way to love a black man


126
0:4:23,805 --> 0:4:25,907
is to trim his mustache.


127
0:4:25,907 --> 0:4:27,108
Who'd have thunk it?


128
0:4:27,108 --> 0:4:28,409
- Okay, so, first,


129
0:4:28,409 --> 0:4:31,345
you said that you bought ram
with the gift card,


130
0:4:31,345 --> 0:4:33,714
and now you're saying
you lost the gift card?


131
0:4:33,714 --> 0:4:35,65
Does this sound right to you, Martin?


132
0:4:35,65 --> 0:4:39,587
- And the 802nd way
to love a black man is to...


133
0:4:39,587 --> 0:4:41,122
Oh, wow.


134
0:4:41,122 --> 0:4:42,69
You'd think this would rate higher.


135
0:4:42,69 --> 0:4:44,659
- Okay, look, look, look.
You know what?


136
0:4:44,659 --> 0:4:46,127
If this was a court of law,


137
0:4:46,127 --> 0:4:48,996
do you know how crazy
you would look right now?


138
0:4:48,996 --> 0:4:50,64
Like, Whoo!


139
0:4:50,64 --> 0:4:52,233
- If this were a court of law,


140
0:4:52,233 --> 0:4:53,534
you wouldn't have a case.


141
0:4:53,534 --> 0:4:55,636
- Oh, really?
- Really.


142
0:4:55,636 --> 0:4:56,904
- You know what?


143
0:4:56,904 --> 0:4:58,773
I know you're used
to being right all the time,


144
0:4:58,773 --> 0:5:0,908
but this time you're wrong.


145
0:5:0,908 --> 0:5:15,443
- [Laughing]


146
0:5:15,443 --> 0:5:17,379
- This is the plaintiff,
Nick Kingston-persons.


147
0:5:17,379 --> 0:5:19,414
He says that his wife, Suzanne,
gave him a gift card


148
0:5:19,414 --> 0:5:21,349
for his birthday, and
after he misplaced it,


149
0:5:21,349 --> 0:5:22,951
she found it and used it on herself.


150
0:5:22,951 --> 0:5:29,457
He's suing for re appropriation
of goods and damages of $300.


151
0:5:29,457 --> 0:5:32,627
- This is the defendant,
Suzanne Kingston-persons.


152
0:5:32,627 --> 0:5:34,763
She says the plaintiff
lost his gift card


153
0:5:34,763 --> 0:5:36,464
and clearly never planned to use it.


154
0:5:36,464 --> 0:5:38,833
And after she found
the gift card in the house,


155
0:5:38,833 --> 0:5:40,535
she asked if he had used his,


156
0:5:40,535 --> 0:5:41,97
and when he said he did,


157
0:5:41,97 --> 0:5:43,972
she saw no problem
with using the gift card


158
0:5:43,972 --> 0:5:45,307
that she found on herself.


159
0:5:45,307 --> 0:5:47,442
She has no intention
of giving him a dime


160
0:5:47,442 --> 0:5:52,781
and says he needs to stop lying.


161
0:5:52,781 --> 0:6:0,655
- All rise.


162
0:6:0,655 --> 0:6:2,9
Be seated and come to order.


163
0:6:2,9 --> 0:6:3,224
Not that I can make y'all.


164
0:6:3,224 --> 0:6:4,726
It ain't like I got a gun.


165
0:6:4,726 --> 0:6:6,861
- I thought we talked about this.


166
0:6:6,861 --> 0:6:9,564
I’m a deal with this
all day long with you now?


167
0:6:9,564 --> 0:6:14,2
Okay, Nick, I see
you're suing your wife...


168
0:6:14,2 --> 0:6:15,3
[Chuckles]


169
0:6:15,3 --> 0:6:17,272
Suzanne, for a gift card.


170
0:6:17,272 --> 0:6:18,273
- Yes.


171
0:6:18,273 --> 0:6:19,941
- All right, tell me what's going on.


172
0:6:19,941 --> 0:6:23,44
- She bought me a gift card,
and I misplaced it,


173
0:6:23,44 --> 0:6:24,212
and she found it.


174
0:6:24,212 --> 0:6:25,981
- Two years later.


175
0:6:25,981 --> 0:6:29,217
- See, see, in my courtroom,
you don't just shout out.


176
0:6:29,217 --> 0:6:30,485
You wait your turn.


177
0:6:30,485 --> 0:6:31,686
You went to public school.


178
0:6:31,686 --> 0:6:33,588
You know, you wait in line
for cheese and stuff.


179
0:6:33,588 --> 0:6:34,522
That's what you do here.


180
0:6:34,522 --> 0:6:36,591
- Yes, your honor.
My apologies.


181
0:6:36,591 --> 0:6:37,659
- Thank you, your honor.


182
0:6:37,659 --> 0:6:40,128
- Do I need your help?


183
0:6:40,128 --> 0:6:41,429
- I... I was just thanking you.


184
0:6:41,429 --> 0:6:43,198
- Do I look crippled?
Do I look like I'm hurt?


185
0:6:43,198 --> 0:6:45,0
Am I leaning to the right?


186
0:6:45,0 --> 0:6:46,101
- No, sir.


187
0:6:46,101 --> 0:6:47,135
- Thank you.


188
0:6:47,135 --> 0:6:48,236
- Okay, well, you know,


189
0:6:48,236 --> 0:6:49,337
my birthday was coming up,


190
0:6:49,337 --> 0:6:51,506
and Suzanne was asking me
what I wanted.


191
0:6:51,506 --> 0:6:53,341
And I didn't want to tell her
what to get me,


192
0:6:53,341 --> 0:6:56,44
'cause, you know, when you pick
out your own birthday present


193
0:6:56,44 --> 0:6:57,278
and that's what you get,


194
0:6:57,278 --> 0:6:58,279
there's no surprise.


195
0:6:58,279 --> 0:6:59,581
- You like surprises, right?


196
0:6:59,581 --> 0:7:0,682
- Yeah, I guess.


197
0:7:0,682 --> 0:7:1,983
- I bet you were surprised


198
0:7:1,983 --> 0:7:4,953
when she spent the money
on your gift card, weren't you?


199
0:7:4,953 --> 0:7:6,154
- I bet he was.


200
0:7:6,154 --> 0:7:7,322
- He was surprised.


201
0:7:7,322 --> 0:7:9,524
Like you're surprised you have no gun.


202
0:7:9,524 --> 0:7:11,226
- Can I say something, your honor?


203
0:7:11,226 --> 0:7:12,66
- Yeah, you just said something.


204
0:7:12,66 --> 0:7:14,562
Now, shut up.


205
0:7:14,562 --> 0:7:17,999
You got an issue?
We gonna have a problem today?


206
0:7:17,999 --> 0:7:19,601
You need some Xanax?


207
0:7:19,601 --> 0:7:20,902
Go on, now, Nick.


208
0:7:20,902 --> 0:7:23,805
- Well, look, all right,
so she got me the card,


209
0:7:23,805 --> 0:7:27,208
and look, I was planning
on using it eventually,


210
0:7:27,208 --> 0:7:30,111
but then I put it somewhere
and I forgot where I put it.


211
0:7:30,111 --> 0:7:31,312
- He lost it.


212
0:7:31,312 --> 0:7:34,15
- Do you not understand English?


213
0:7:34,15 --> 0:7:35,617
I told you to be quiet.


214
0:7:35,617 --> 0:7:36,818
I'll have you thrown out of here


215
0:7:36,818 --> 0:7:38,787
faster then Mel Gibson
should get off that phone.


216
0:7:38,787 --> 0:7:40,121
You understand me?


217
0:7:40,121 --> 0:7:41,589
Be quiet.


218
0:7:41,589 --> 0:7:43,358
- You see what I'm dealing with,
your honor?


219
0:7:43,358 --> 0:7:44,392
- I see what you dealing with.


220
0:7:44,392 --> 0:7:45,894
You married it.
Don't ask me why.


221
0:7:45,894 --> 0:7:48,129
- Okay, well, I misplaced the card,


222
0:7:48,129 --> 0:7:50,799
and then I couldn't...
I forgot where I put it,


223
0:7:50,799 --> 0:7:53,368
and then she found it,
and she knew it was my card.


224
0:7:53,368 --> 0:7:54,936
- Oh, you psychic.


225
0:7:54,936 --> 0:7:56,4
- Huh?


226
0:7:56,4 --> 0:7:57,238
- You psychic, right?


227
0:7:57,238 --> 0:7:59,107
That's how you know
what people think, right?


228
0:7:59,107 --> 0:8:3,845
Where's her gun?


229
0:8:3,845 --> 0:8:5,647
You don't know, do you?


230
0:8:5,647 --> 0:8:7,48
'Cause you ain't psychic.


231
0:8:7,48 --> 0:8:8,683
So why don't you just tell me
what you know


232
0:8:8,683 --> 0:8:10,151
instead of what other people know.


233
0:8:10,151 --> 0:8:11,619
Can we do that?


234
0:8:11,619 --> 0:8:13,521
- Okay, well, she found it,


235
0:8:13,521 --> 0:8:15,156
and I didn't know she found it,


236
0:8:15,156 --> 0:8:18,56
but what she did was
ask me if I'd spent mine.


237
0:8:18,56 --> 0:8:19,828
- And what did you say?


238
0:8:19,828 --> 0:8:20,895
- I said I had.


239
0:8:20,895 --> 0:8:21,863
- [Chuckles]


240
0:8:21,863 --> 0:8:23,164
File for the defendant.
You win.


241
0:8:23,164 --> 0:8:25,667
- Whoo!
- No, no!


242
0:8:25,667 --> 0:8:26,701
[Women screaming]


243
0:8:26,701 --> 0:8:28,136
- Ha-ha!
I'm playing!


244
0:8:28,136 --> 0:8:29,471
I'm playing, I'm playing!


245
0:8:29,471 --> 0:8:30,738
You think you're gonna win?


246
0:8:30,738 --> 0:8:32,6
You're out your mind.


247
0:8:32,6 --> 0:8:34,576
You can't shut up.


248
0:8:34,576 --> 0:8:36,44
You see that?
She was all excited.


249
0:8:36,44 --> 0:8:37,11
- You play too much.


250
0:8:37,11 --> 0:8:38,113
- "Oh, my God!
Oh, my God!


251
0:8:38,113 --> 0:8:40,482
High five!
High five!"


252
0:8:40,482 --> 0:8:42,45
Don't be high-fiving people
up in here.


253
0:8:42,45 --> 0:8:45,386
So why'd you tell her that you
spent the card if you didn't?


254
0:8:45,386 --> 0:8:47,722
- Well, I didn't want
to hurt her feelings


255
0:8:47,722 --> 0:8:50,225
and have her think
I didn't care about her gift.


256
0:8:50,225 --> 0:8:51,226
- You got any witnesses?


257
0:8:51,226 --> 0:8:52,527
- Yes, your honor.


258
0:8:52,527 --> 0:8:56,164
I'd like to call my mother,
miss Marilyn persons.


259
0:8:56,164 --> 0:8:57,499
- Okay.


260
0:8:57,499 --> 0:8:59,2
- Thank you, baby.


261
0:8:59,2 --> 0:9:0,368
- How are you, Mrs. persons?


262
0:9:0,368 --> 0:9:2,7
Tell us what you know.


263
0:9:2,7 --> 0:9:3,605
- I will, your honor.


264
0:9:3,605 --> 0:9:4,939
I know she crazy.


265
0:9:4,939 --> 0:9:6,141
I know I'm not gonna sit up here


266
0:9:6,141 --> 0:9:8,9
and let her talk about my son
any kind of way,


267
0:9:8,9 --> 0:9:10,178
because she's lucky to have him.


268
0:9:10,178 --> 0:9:12,714
- I agree with you, but I'm
asking you about the card.


269
0:9:12,714 --> 0:9:14,182
What do you know about the gift card?


270
0:9:14,182 --> 0:9:15,583
- I don't know anything about that.


271
0:9:15,583 --> 0:9:17,285
But I don't see what
the big deal is anyway.


272
0:9:17,285 --> 0:9:18,486
It's a gift card.


273
0:9:18,486 --> 0:9:20,188
All you got to do is go to the store,


274
0:9:20,188 --> 0:9:21,689
get another one for her birthday,


275
0:9:21,689 --> 0:9:23,691
steal it back, and then spend it
all on yourself.


276
0:9:23,691 --> 0:9:26,294
She how she likes that.


277
0:9:26,294 --> 0:9:27,295
[Pounding]


278
0:9:27,295 --> 0:9:29,964
- You go ahead and sit down.


279
0:9:29,964 --> 0:9:31,299
I'm scared to ask this question,


280
0:9:31,299 --> 0:9:33,1
but do you have any evidence?


281
0:9:33,1 --> 0:9:34,636
- Yes, I do, your honor.


282
0:9:34,636 --> 0:9:36,804
This is the box the phone came in


283
0:9:36,804 --> 0:9:38,406
and my birthday card.


284
0:9:38,406 --> 0:9:40,775
- [Laughing] He got a box.


285
0:9:40,775 --> 0:9:41,776
- That the phone came in.


286
0:9:41,776 --> 0:9:43,845
- The phone came in.


287
0:9:43,845 --> 0:9:45,246
I asked you if you had evidence.


288
0:9:45,246 --> 0:9:46,948
See, evidence is something like,
you know,


289
0:9:46,948 --> 0:9:48,483
I got a smoking gun, I got a knife,


290
0:9:48,483 --> 0:9:49,484
I got some gloves.


291
0:9:49,484 --> 0:9:50,752
They don't fit, we can't acquit.


292
0:9:50,752 --> 0:9:52,987
It's like a girl tied up
in the trunk of your car


293
0:9:52,987 --> 0:9:54,355
with some duct tape over her mouth.


294
0:9:54,355 --> 0:9:56,691
That's evidence,
but this ain't evidence.


295
0:9:56,691 --> 0:9:57,825
This is not evidence, man.


296
0:9:57,825 --> 0:9:59,561
You know, if you're
just gonna waste my time


297
0:9:59,561 --> 0:10:1,696
by bringing something that ain't
gonna help your case,


298
0:10:1,696 --> 0:10:3,198
'cause this don't help your case,


299
0:10:3,198 --> 0:10:5,567
you might as well have brought
something that makes me happy,


300
0:10:5,567 --> 0:10:7,669
like some cake... did you have
cake for your birthday?


301
0:10:7,669 --> 0:10:9,304
- Yes, I did.


302
0:10:9,304 --> 0:10:11,639
- I'm glad you got something,
'cause you didn't get no phone.


303
0:10:11,639 --> 0:10:13,541
What kind of cake did you get
for your birthday?


304
0:10:13,541 --> 0:10:14,542
- Sweet potato pound cake.


305
0:10:14,542 --> 0:10:15,543
- What'd he say?


306
0:10:15,543 --> 0:10:16,878
- Sweet potato pound cake.


307
0:10:16,878 --> 0:10:18,446
- What kind of cake do the judge like?


308
0:10:18,446 --> 0:10:19,681
- Sweet potato pound cake.


309
0:10:19,681 --> 0:10:21,216
- Yeah, that's what I'm talking about.


310
0:10:21,216 --> 0:10:23,318
Who made this sweet potato pound cake?


311
0:10:23,318 --> 0:10:24,552
- My wife.


312
0:10:24,552 --> 0:10:27,121
- She got the recipe from me,
your honor.


313
0:10:27,121 --> 0:10:28,556
- Oh, I see.


314
0:10:28,556 --> 0:10:30,959
We're gonna take a short recess
while I get this recipe.


315
0:10:30,959 --> 0:10:32,527
- Hey, man.


316
0:10:32,527 --> 0:10:34,762
- Miss persons, will you meet me
in the chambers, please?


317
0:10:34,762 --> 0:10:35,83
- I will do that, your honor.


318
0:10:35,83 --> 0:10:36,965
- Talk about this recipe.


319
0:10:36,965 --> 0:10:38,166
- Are you serious?


320
0:10:38,166 --> 0:10:41,302
- I said don't say nothing else!


321
0:10:41,302 --> 0:10:42,837
I'll be with your mama.


322
0:10:42,837 --> 0:10:49,896
- Hey, hey, hey.


323
0:10:49,896 --> 0:10:52,98
- Your mama crazy.


324
0:10:52,98 --> 0:10:53,666
And she's a wonderful person.


325
0:10:53,666 --> 0:10:55,635
- That's my mother,
and you don't know my mother.


326
0:10:55,635 --> 0:10:57,203
- I know her now.


327
0:10:57,203 --> 0:10:59,72
Ha-ha!
Bam.


328
0:10:59,72 --> 0:11:0,273
- What?
- Boo-yah!


329
0:11:0,273 --> 0:11:1,408
- Hey!
- Hey, Judy.


330
0:11:1,408 --> 0:11:2,475
- You did it.


331
0:11:2,475 --> 0:11:3,943
- Let's get this thing started, Judy.


332
0:11:3,943 --> 0:11:5,645
- Court is now back in session.


333
0:11:5,645 --> 0:11:6,646
- Mrs. Kingston-persons,


334
0:11:6,646 --> 0:11:8,81
I know you've been waiting to talk.


335
0:11:8,81 --> 0:11:10,784
Now it's your time, so talk
and tell us your story.


336
0:11:10,784 --> 0:11:12,886
- Your honor,
I'd like to start by saying


337
0:11:12,886 --> 0:11:15,55
that birthdays are very important to me,


338
0:11:15,55 --> 0:11:17,257
and obviously because it's my husband,


339
0:11:17,257 --> 0:11:18,658
it's a top priority.


340
0:11:18,658 --> 0:11:20,126
- That's enough.


341
0:11:20,126 --> 0:11:22,429
Ha-ha, I'm playing.
I'm playing.


342
0:11:22,429 --> 0:11:25,365
I'm playing; I had a little bit
to drink in the back.


343
0:11:25,365 --> 0:11:26,466
Go ahead.
My bad.


344
0:11:26,466 --> 0:11:28,468
- Whenever I give something to someone,


345
0:11:28,468 --> 0:11:29,769
I want to make sure it's something


346
0:11:29,769 --> 0:11:31,438
that they're really gonna enjoy.


347
0:11:31,438 --> 0:11:32,972
- Oh, I see,
and if they don't enjoy it,


348
0:11:32,972 --> 0:11:36,76
you just, what, take it back from them?


349
0:11:36,76 --> 0:11:37,343
- No, your honor.


350
0:11:37,343 --> 0:11:38,878
I wanted this gift to be different,


351
0:11:38,878 --> 0:11:41,915
because the first three attempts
weren't great.


352
0:11:41,915 --> 0:11:43,149
- What was your first attempt?


353
0:11:43,149 --> 0:11:45,385
- I got him a box set of prince songs.


354
0:11:45,385 --> 0:11:47,12
- No, you didn't.
Prince?


355
0:11:47,12 --> 0:11:51,424
Girl, I didn't think
you like... look at you.


356
0:11:51,424 --> 0:11:52,659
Who loves prince?


357
0:11:52,659 --> 0:11:54,594
- The judge loves prince.


358
0:11:54,594 --> 0:11:56,696
- Hold up.
You don't like prince?


359
0:11:56,696 --> 0:11:57,664
- Can I...


360
0:11:57,664 --> 0:11:59,99
- You don't like prince?


361
0:11:59,99 --> 0:12:0,667
You don't like prince?
- I like prince.


362
0:12:0,667 --> 0:12:1,868
- We can shut this down now.


363
0:12:1,868 --> 0:12:3,436
You don't like the purple wonder?


364
0:12:3,436 --> 0:12:4,637
- I had it already.


365
0:12:4,637 --> 0:12:6,139
- You didn't tell her that, did you?


366
0:12:6,139 --> 0:12:7,707
- Yes, he did.


367
0:12:7,707 --> 0:12:9,75
- You got a cd player in your house?


368
0:12:9,75 --> 0:12:10,243
- Yeah, I got a cd player.


369
0:12:10,243 --> 0:12:11,578
- You got a cd player in your car?


370
0:12:11,578 --> 0:12:12,512
- Yeah.


371
0:12:12,512 --> 0:12:13,847
- Judy, what should he have done?


372
0:12:13,847 --> 0:12:16,15
- Should have just listened
to the prince in your car.


373
0:12:16,15 --> 0:12:17,5
- There you go.


374
0:12:17,5 --> 0:12:18,718
But you just trying
to be honest, right?


375
0:12:18,718 --> 0:12:19,853
That's why you couldn't do that.


376
0:12:19,853 --> 0:12:21,855
- If I am not honest with this woman,


377
0:12:21,855 --> 0:12:23,623
what else can it lead to, man?


378
0:12:23,623 --> 0:12:25,692
- Okay, man, I'm not saying
you got to lie to your wife.


379
0:12:25,692 --> 0:12:27,127
You should never lie to your wife,


380
0:12:27,127 --> 0:12:28,261
'cause they'll find out anyway,


381
0:12:28,261 --> 0:12:29,829
'cause they got stuff in your computer.


382
0:12:29,829 --> 0:12:31,331
They can find out where you've been.


383
0:12:31,331 --> 0:12:32,499
Trust me on that one.


384
0:12:32,499 --> 0:12:34,267
I'm saying sometimes
you can fool your wife.


385
0:12:34,267 --> 0:12:35,935
- Wait, wait, wait.
What's the difference?


386
0:12:35,935 --> 0:12:37,47
- Yes, your honor,
I'd like to know too.


387
0:12:37,47 --> 0:12:38,972
- I would tell you, but you know what,


388
0:12:38,972 --> 0:12:39,973
my wife watches the show.


389
0:12:39,973 --> 0:12:40,94
What's up, baby?


390
0:12:40,94 --> 0:12:42,375
You see what they tried to do, Judy?


391
0:12:42,375 --> 0:12:43,676
- Yeah.
- What they try to do?


392
0:12:43,676 --> 0:12:46,79
Trying to make a fool of me,
but who's not a fool?


393
0:12:46,79 --> 0:12:47,8
- You not a fool.


394
0:12:47,8 --> 0:12:48,281
- That's right.
I ain't no fool.


395
0:12:48,281 --> 0:12:49,649
That's why I didn't fall for that.


396
0:12:49,649 --> 0:12:51,584
I'm too quick.
You see that?


397
0:12:51,584 --> 0:12:54,87
You didn't see me move, did you?


398
0:12:54,87 --> 0:12:55,188
Go ahead.


399
0:12:55,188 --> 0:12:56,589
What else you get this man?


400
0:12:56,589 --> 0:12:58,258
- Madden 2008.


401
0:12:58,258 --> 0:12:59,592
- He mad about that?


402
0:12:59,592 --> 0:13:1,227
What's wrong with madden 2008.


403
0:13:1,227 --> 0:13:3,263
- It was 2009, your honor.


404
0:13:3,263 --> 0:13:4,43
- Well, what's the difference?


405
0:13:4,43 --> 0:13:5,665
- What's the difference?


406
0:13:5,665 --> 0:13:7,3
They change the game every year.


407
0:13:7,3 --> 0:13:9,435
That's why they make 2008, 2009.


408
0:13:9,435 --> 0:13:10,47
- No, they don't.


409
0:13:10,47 --> 0:13:11,938
They put a different dude on the box.


410
0:13:11,938 --> 0:13:13,373
I got the game I've got the game!


411
0:13:13,373 --> 0:13:15,208
I got 2008 and 2009.


412
0:13:15,208 --> 0:13:17,243
Ain't no difference, just the box!


413
0:13:17,243 --> 0:13:19,279
That's how they get $45 from you.


414
0:13:19,279 --> 0:13:20,947
Your wife was saving money.


415
0:13:20,947 --> 0:13:22,682
- Your honor, after all of that,


416
0:13:22,682 --> 0:13:25,552
I finally just relented
and got a gift card,


417
0:13:25,552 --> 0:13:27,987
because I figured that way
he could pick something out


418
0:13:27,987 --> 0:13:29,88
that he really wanted,


419
0:13:29,88 --> 0:13:31,24
and he would be happy
and I would be happy.


420
0:13:31,24 --> 0:13:33,76
- Can I say something?
- Oh!


421
0:13:33,76 --> 0:13:36,396
I can't look at you.
Is he still here, Judy?


422
0:13:36,396 --> 0:13:38,198
- I think he is, sir.
- Is he trying to talk to me?


423
0:13:38,198 --> 0:13:40,4
- He's trying to talk to you.
- Have I told him to shut up?


424
0:13:40,4 --> 0:13:41,467
I still hear voices.


425
0:13:41,467 --> 0:13:42,869
- Your honor...
- I still hear voices.


426
0:13:42,869 --> 0:13:44,137
- Can I...
- I still hear voices.


427
0:13:44,137 --> 0:13:45,205
- Can I say something?


428
0:13:45,205 --> 0:13:49,475
- I hear voices!


429
0:13:49,475 --> 0:13:51,511
These folks don't learn nothing.


430
0:13:51,511 --> 0:13:52,679
Go ahead.


431
0:13:52,679 --> 0:13:53,746
- Well, your honor,


432
0:13:53,746 --> 0:13:55,615
I would like to now
present my witnesses.


433
0:13:55,615 --> 0:13:57,584
- Oh, you got witnesses?
- Yes, sir.


434
0:13:57,584 --> 0:13:59,252
- Oh, this is gonna be fun.


435
0:13:59,252 --> 0:14:0,92
Go ahead.
Bring your first witness.


436
0:14:0,92 --> 0:14:6,326
- My first witness is my son Kevin.


437
0:14:6,326 --> 0:14:7,727
- Is this your first time in court?


438
0:14:7,727 --> 0:14:9,128
- Yes, your honor.


439
0:14:9,128 --> 0:14:11,3
- It's a shame that your first
time in court is here


440
0:14:11,3 --> 0:14:12,799
'cause your mother and father
are fighting


441
0:14:12,799 --> 0:14:13,9
about some kind of gift card,


442
0:14:13,9 --> 0:14:15,34
when as a young black man,


443
0:14:15,34 --> 0:14:17,3
you have plenty of opportunities
to be in court.


444
0:14:17,3 --> 0:14:19,239
You could be picked up
for assault, battery,


445
0:14:19,239 --> 0:14:21,908
driving drunk, driving while black,


446
0:14:21,908 --> 0:14:24,77
taking a white woman
across state lines.


447
0:14:24,77 --> 0:14:26,446
You have plenty of opportunities
to come to this courtroom,


448
0:14:26,446 --> 0:14:28,81
and this is a wasted opportunity
for you,


449
0:14:28,81 --> 0:14:29,349
and I want to apologize.


450
0:14:29,349 --> 0:14:30,683
- I'd rather not go to court.


451
0:14:30,683 --> 0:14:32,85
- Oh, you're gonna go.
You're black.


452
0:14:32,85 --> 0:14:33,519
You're gonna go.
It's gonna happen.


453
0:14:33,519 --> 0:14:35,221
So, Kevin, what do you know
about this case?


454
0:14:35,221 --> 0:14:37,223
- My dad asked me and my friend Troy


455
0:14:37,223 --> 0:14:38,424
to help look for the gift card.


456
0:14:38,424 --> 0:14:40,126
- Is this Troy in the courtroom now?


457
0:14:40,126 --> 0:14:41,94
- Yes.


458
0:14:41,94 --> 0:14:43,396
- Step up to the mic, please.


459
0:14:43,396 --> 0:14:44,664
Are you Troy?


460
0:14:44,664 --> 0:14:48,134
- I am he, your honor.


461
0:14:48,134 --> 0:14:49,135
- [Laughs]


462
0:14:49,135 --> 0:14:50,37
- It is he, your honor.
- He is he.


463
0:14:50,37 --> 0:14:51,938
Would you like to state your last name?


464
0:14:51,938 --> 0:14:53,473
- Not particularly.


465
0:14:53,473 --> 0:14:57,143
I don't see how that's relevant
to the proceedings hereforth.


466
0:14:57,143 --> 0:14:59,212
- Oh, hereforth.
- Hereforth.


467
0:14:59,212 --> 0:15:1,47
- That's a big word for a little man.


468
0:15:1,47 --> 0:15:3,216
- All I'm saying, your honor,
is that I am simply here


469
0:15:3,216 --> 0:15:5,585
as a moral and fiduciary accoutrement


470
0:15:5,585 --> 0:15:7,186
to Mr. Kingston-persons.


471
0:15:7,186 --> 0:15:8,554
My name is irrelevant.


472
0:15:8,554 --> 0:15:11,424
What's relevant
is that I've taken a stand.


473
0:15:11,424 --> 0:15:13,693
- What's relevant is,
drug usage is destroying


474
0:15:13,693 --> 0:15:16,362
young people across America.


475
0:15:16,362 --> 0:15:18,197
And, Kevin, if you want to continue


476
0:15:18,197 --> 0:15:19,232
to grow up and be a good man,


477
0:15:19,232 --> 0:15:21,801
you got to let some friends go.


478
0:15:21,801 --> 0:15:23,369
Troy, you sit your little butt down.


479
0:15:23,369 --> 0:15:24,704
And we're gonna get you some help.


480
0:15:24,704 --> 0:15:26,706
We're gonna have people come in
from child services


481
0:15:26,706 --> 0:15:28,107
to find out what your problem is.


482
0:15:28,107 --> 0:15:29,776
- Is this the best you got?


483
0:15:29,776 --> 0:15:32,545
Your mama and a little white boy?


484
0:15:32,545 --> 0:15:34,614
Kevin, you got anything else
to add to this?


485
0:15:34,614 --> 0:15:36,115
- Um, yes, your honor.


486
0:15:36,115 --> 0:15:38,484
My father told me, whatever you do,


487
0:15:38,484 --> 0:15:41,621
do not tell your mother
what we're looking for.


488
0:15:41,621 --> 0:15:43,923
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.
- See?


489
0:15:43,923 --> 0:15:46,59
- Hey!
Hey!


490
0:15:46,59 --> 0:15:47,927
Asking a child to lie?


491
0:15:47,927 --> 0:15:51,331
- Telling him not to say
anything is not a lie.


492
0:15:51,331 --> 0:15:53,599
- Thank you.
Thank you.


493
0:15:53,599 --> 0:15:54,901
That's all.


494
0:15:54,901 --> 0:15:57,103
Young man, you can step down.


495
0:15:57,103 --> 0:16:0,39
Do you have anymore witnesses?


496
0:16:0,39 --> 0:16:4,911
- I'd like to call my daughter Lindsey.


497
0:16:4,911 --> 0:16:6,479
- So what do you know about this case?


498
0:16:6,479 --> 0:16:7,647
- Not much, sir.


499
0:16:7,647 --> 0:16:9,716
All I know is, is that I was
not exactly there


500
0:16:9,716 --> 0:16:11,317
when they were looking
for the gift card,


501
0:16:11,317 --> 0:16:14,287
but when I returned home
my bedroom was a complete mess.


502
0:16:14,287 --> 0:16:16,556
- Now, how was your bedroom
before you left?


503
0:16:16,556 --> 0:16:18,391
- Um, it was a mess.


504
0:16:18,391 --> 0:16:20,493
- Then you can just sit down.


505
0:16:20,493 --> 0:16:22,195
Anymore witnesses?


506
0:16:22,195 --> 0:16:23,363
- I'd like to call


507
0:16:23,363 --> 0:16:25,665
Nick's best friend Martin to the stand.


508
0:16:25,665 --> 0:16:27,3
- Oh, no.
No, you didn't.


509
0:16:27,3 --> 0:16:29,102
- Now you're gonna sit here...


510
0:16:29,102 --> 0:16:30,69
- No, you did not!


511
0:16:30,69 --> 0:16:32,505
No, you did not
bring your best friend...


512
0:16:32,505 --> 0:16:35,41
Young man, young man,
young man, young man.


513
0:16:35,41 --> 0:16:36,609
Obviously you're not married, right?


514
0:16:36,609 --> 0:16:37,81
- I am...


515
0:16:37,81 --> 0:16:39,412
- So you don't know
the rules of marriage.


516
0:16:39,412 --> 0:16:41,848
- This is true.
- This man needs you.


517
0:16:41,848 --> 0:16:43,983
And you're on her side.


518
0:16:43,983 --> 0:16:45,251
- I wouldn't say I'm on her side.


519
0:16:45,251 --> 0:16:47,487
- Just say the truth!
Just tell me the truth!


520
0:16:47,487 --> 0:16:50,79
- I can't handle the truth!


521
0:16:50,79 --> 0:16:52,258
- I know what's going on here, Judy.


522
0:16:52,258 --> 0:16:53,659
- What's going on?


523
0:16:53,659 --> 0:16:56,429
- If you're feeling the stress
from Nick's wife,


524
0:16:56,429 --> 0:17:1,3
blink twice.


525
0:17:1,3 --> 0:17:3,336
You are excused.


526
0:17:3,336 --> 0:17:4,937
- I'd like to speak, your honor.


527
0:17:4,937 --> 0:17:6,406
- Who the hell are you?


528
0:17:6,406 --> 0:17:8,207
- I am Suzanne's assistant


529
0:17:8,207 --> 0:17:11,544
and real best supportive friend Gigi.


530
0:17:11,544 --> 0:17:13,45
- You're her best friend, Gigi?
- Yes.


531
0:17:13,45 --> 0:17:14,814
- Then I'd like you to go over
to Nick's side


532
0:17:14,814 --> 0:17:16,282
so you can see what that feels like,


533
0:17:16,282 --> 0:17:17,617
to have a friend be a traitor.


534
0:17:17,617 --> 0:17:18,584
Please go to that side.


535
0:17:18,584 --> 0:17:21,521
- [Laughing] Yeah, come on over.


536
0:17:21,521 --> 0:17:23,99
- And I'd like to say,
no matter where I'm standing,


537
0:17:23,99 --> 0:17:25,591
the truth will prevail.


538
0:17:25,591 --> 0:17:26,926
- Something will.


539
0:17:26,926 --> 0:17:29,28
So, Gigi, what do you know about this?


540
0:17:29,28 --> 0:17:31,564
- Well, I purchased the gift card.


541
0:17:31,564 --> 0:17:33,599
- Oh, you purchased the gift card?


542
0:17:33,599 --> 0:17:34,7
- Yes, your honor.


543
0:17:34,7 --> 0:17:36,102
- She's my assistant, your honor,


544
0:17:36,102 --> 0:17:38,237
so I asked her to go pick it up.


545
0:17:38,237 --> 0:17:40,6
- Uh-uh, you asked her to speak;
Let her speak.


546
0:17:40,6 --> 0:17:42,275
- Well, I can tell you
that Suzanne was very excited


547
0:17:42,275 --> 0:17:43,743
about getting Nick this gift card,


548
0:17:43,743 --> 0:17:46,379
'cause she wanted him to have
something he really wanted.


549
0:17:46,379 --> 0:17:48,748
When I asked, "what did he get
with the gift card?"


550
0:17:48,748 --> 0:17:50,616
She said he didn't buy anything.


551
0:17:50,616 --> 0:17:51,617
- When was this?


552
0:17:51,617 --> 0:17:52,952
- About a week after his birthday.


553
0:17:52,952 --> 0:17:54,72
But then I didn't hear anything
else about it


554
0:17:54,72 --> 0:17:56,155
until she came to work the other day


555
0:17:56,155 --> 0:17:57,623
and said he had lied to her


556
0:17:57,623 --> 0:17:59,992
and said he had bought something
with the card, but he didn't,


557
0:17:59,992 --> 0:18:1,794
because he lost it, and she found it,


558
0:18:1,794 --> 0:18:3,729
and I told her she ought
to get herself something


559
0:18:3,729 --> 0:18:5,998
to get through the pain
of being lied to,


560
0:18:5,998 --> 0:18:7,5
and she got herself a phone.


561
0:18:7,5 --> 0:18:10,203
- That's how it happened!


562
0:18:10,203 --> 0:18:11,471
- Hey!
Hey!


563
0:18:11,471 --> 0:18:13,639
Hey!
Everybody shut up!


564
0:18:13,639 --> 0:18:16,242
Everybody shut up!


565
0:18:16,242 --> 0:18:17,51
I've had about enough.


566
0:18:17,51 --> 0:18:19,679
I will throw every last one
of you out this courtroom.


567
0:18:19,679 --> 0:18:21,47
I swear to God.


568
0:18:21,47 --> 0:18:23,249
- It would not have gotten
to this point if I'd had a gun.


569
0:18:23,249 --> 0:18:25,251
- Well, you know what?
You got one now.


570
0:18:25,251 --> 0:18:26,452
[People shouting]


571
0:18:26,452 --> 0:18:28,54
I'll tell you what.
I'll tell you what.


572
0:18:28,54 --> 0:18:29,555
I'll tell you what.


573
0:18:29,555 --> 0:18:31,791
Y'all come in this court,
you're gonna have some respect,


574
0:18:31,791 --> 0:18:33,626
even if this is just a tv show
and this ain't real


575
0:18:33,626 --> 0:18:35,328
and she ain't a bailiff
and I ain't a judge!


576
0:18:35,328 --> 0:18:37,196
We're gonna act like it is!


577
0:18:37,196 --> 0:18:39,532
- Is this a real gun?
- That's a real gun.


578
0:18:39,532 --> 0:18:46,433
I'm going back to make my decision.


579
0:18:46,433 --> 0:18:47,434
This case wore me out.


580
0:18:47,434 --> 0:18:48,802
I mean, for y'all to be coming here


581
0:18:48,802 --> 0:18:49,903
arguing about a gift card...


582
0:18:49,903 --> 0:18:51,138
- It's the principle.


583
0:18:51,138 --> 0:18:53,173
- Well, I hope you like sleeping
with the principal,


584
0:18:53,173 --> 0:18:55,375
'cause you're gonna be sleeping
with her for a long time.


585
0:18:55,375 --> 0:18:57,411
Just because your man's crazy
don't mean he's wrong.


586
0:18:57,411 --> 0:18:59,79
Now, from listening
to all the testimony


587
0:18:59,79 --> 0:19:0,614
of the witnesses,


588
0:19:0,614 --> 0:19:3,5
even though he lied about
what he did with the card,


589
0:19:3,5 --> 0:19:4,84
I don't think he ever planned


590
0:19:4,84 --> 0:19:6,119
to relinquish possession of the card.


591
0:19:6,119 --> 0:19:7,354
It was a gift card.


592
0:19:7,354 --> 0:19:9,222
Even though you don't like
what he did with it,


593
0:19:9,222 --> 0:19:10,323
it was his present.


594
0:19:10,323 --> 0:19:11,425
It was his card,


595
0:19:11,425 --> 0:19:13,93
and you don't have a right
to take it back.


596
0:19:13,93 --> 0:19:14,27
Do you understand me?


597
0:19:14,27 --> 0:19:16,563
I have to judge in favor
of the plaintiff


598
0:19:16,563 --> 0:19:17,964
for $300.


599
0:19:17,964 --> 0:19:19,533
- Yes!
Ha ha ha!


600
0:19:19,533 --> 0:19:20,967
I want my money!


601
0:19:20,967 --> 0:19:22,235
Look, what is it now?


602
0:19:22,235 --> 0:19:23,47
It's coming.
It's coming.


603
0:19:23,47 --> 0:19:25,105
Boop!
It's on your head.


604
0:19:25,105 --> 0:19:27,174
- Go ahead, laugh it up.
Have your fun.


605
0:19:27,174 --> 0:19:28,442
I will pay you back.


606
0:19:28,442 --> 0:19:31,578
A dollar a year for the next 300 years.


607
0:19:31,578 --> 0:19:34,514
- Remember that if you break up
and you have to pay alimony.


608
0:19:34,514 --> 0:19:36,149
- We are not breaking up, ma.


609
0:19:36,149 --> 0:19:39,19
- Especially not if she tries
number 874.


610
0:19:39,19 --> 0:19:40,687
- What's number 874?


611
0:19:40,687 --> 0:19:44,357
- It's pretty much just 873
but with whipped cream.


612
0:19:44,357 --> 0:19:45,792
- I read that book, and frankly,


613
0:19:45,792 --> 0:19:48,361
I think it's a waste of whipped cream.


614
0:19:48,361 --> 0:19:51,264
- Are you guys talking about
<i>1,000 ways to love a black man?</i>


615
0:19:51,264 --> 0:19:52,899
- Yes, why?


616
0:19:52,899 --> 0:19:54,501
- My mom has that book.


617
0:19:54,501 --> 0:19:58,839
- Okay, Kevin, can you take Troy
to your room?


618
0:19:58,839 --> 0:20:1,308
And Lindsey, go clean your room.
It's a mess.


619
0:20:1,308 --> 0:20:3,176
- Okay, mom.


620
0:20:3,176 --> 0:20:6,48
- Suzanne, I'm sorry
that I ruined your case.


621
0:20:6,48 --> 0:20:8,748
- Oh, there's no need to apologize.


622
0:20:8,748 --> 0:20:10,117
You were just telling the truth.


623
0:20:10,117 --> 0:20:11,651
I can't hold that against you.


624
0:20:11,651 --> 0:20:13,22
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.


625
0:20:13,22 --> 0:20:15,222
- Now, is this what married couples do?


626
0:20:15,222 --> 0:20:16,656
Fight over everything?


627
0:20:16,656 --> 0:20:17,891
- No.
- Yes.


628
0:20:17,891 --> 0:20:19,759
- See, this is why
I'm never getting married.


629
0:20:19,759 --> 0:20:21,661
I can't pretend
to put somebody else's needs


630
0:20:21,661 --> 0:20:22,762
above my own,


631
0:20:22,762 --> 0:20:26,366
which is number 974.


632
0:20:26,366 --> 0:20:29,35
- Nick, I am sorry.


633
0:20:29,35 --> 0:20:30,504
- Oh, it's okay, baby.


634
0:20:30,504 --> 0:20:32,139
You can always buy me another present.


635
0:20:32,139 --> 0:20:34,7
- Well, I'm not getting you
another gift card.


636
0:20:34,7 --> 0:20:35,108
I know that.


637
0:20:35,108 --> 0:20:36,143
- It's cool.


638
0:20:36,143 --> 0:20:37,244
- So what do you want?


639
0:20:37,244 --> 0:20:41,781
- Um...
Does it have to be from a store?


640
0:20:41,781 --> 0:20:43,483
[People groaning]


641
0:20:43,483 --> 0:20:45,51
- What?


642
0:20:45,51 --> 0:20:46,553
- All right, that's our cue to leave.


643
0:20:46,553 --> 0:20:47,921
Gigi, let's get something to eat.


644
0:20:47,921 --> 0:20:49,289
- You treating?


645
0:20:49,289 --> 0:20:50,457
- My treat?


646
0:20:50,457 --> 0:20:52,92
Don't you owe me 60 bucks?


647
0:20:52,92 --> 0:20:55,295
- No.
- Yes.


648
0:20:55,295 --> 0:20:57,613
- Prove it.
