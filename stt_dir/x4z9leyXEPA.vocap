###3 SIMON OSTROVSKY: The Israeli military has organized a
###6 little briefing to show off their new missile defense
###9 system called the Iron Dome.
###11 And the commander has actually come here to tell the
###14 international press about their brand new toy.
###17 So we're going to check it out.
###18 
###26 
###42 SIMON OSTROVSKY: This latest war with Gaza was the first
###45 time Iron Dome had been deployed against an onslaught
###48 of this kind.
###49 Israel and the United States decided to fund it for almost
###52 a billion dollars each after the 2006 conflict with
###56 Hezbollah in Lebanon.
###58 That war saw 4,000 similarly crude rockets kill 44 people
###62 in northern Israel.
###64 With casualties low, public pressure on Israeli
###67 politicians to retaliate was weak, too.
###70 It made me wonder if targeting Hamas was a military
###72 necessity at all.
###74 Do you think it's less necessary for Israel to strike
###77 in the Gaza Strip as it has been, now that people here are
###80 protected by your very successful Iron Dome system?
###82 
###87 -Thank you very much.
###90 SIMON OSTROVSKY: My question was answered by the Israeli
###92 Air Force instead, which launched a strike on the Gaza
###95 media center at about the same time our press conference was
###98 being held, killing a top leader in the Islamic Jihad.
###102 So was all of this carnage necessary?
###104 Could it have been avoided?
###106 I met an Israeli who thought it could have been.
###108 Gershon Baskin is the man who had negotiated with Ahmed
###111 Jabari for the release of Gilad Shalit.
###114 He told me that the day Jabari was killed, he was supposed to
###117 have given an answer about a ceasefire proposal Baskin had
###121 put forward.
###122 If you're able to negotiate with Hamas, how come this
###125 time, negotiations weren't able to head off this new
###128 round of violence?
###129 GERSHON BASKIN: The day that it happened, Jabari had seen
###131 the proposal for an extended ceasefire.
###134 It was for a three to month trial period that involved not
###137 only stopping fire but taking preventive action on their
###140 side against groups that would try to attack Israel.
###143 Every time over the past two years we've gotten involved in
###147 helping to negotiate a ceasefire, at the end of the
###149 day it was Jabari who went and sent his forces out to impose
###153 the ceasefire.
###154 So there was more than a good indication that he would have
###158 supported a three to six month trial period.
###160 The prevailing wisdom amongst the Israeli military and
###163 security forces is that what we needed to do, more than
###166 anything else, was to create deterrence.
###168 Make them so scared of what we will do that they
###171 won't shoot at us.
###172 The decision to take out Ahmed Jabari was very clear.
###176 This guy's the head of the pyramid.
###177 If we could get him, there's no one who has impunity.
###181 SIMON OSTROVSKY: Yet, you're an Israeli who doesn't support
###184 the fact that Ahmed Jabari was assassinated.
###187 GERSHON BASKIN: What I'm saying is that you use force
###189 as the very, very, very last option.
###193 You try and exhaust every other possibility
###196 before you use force.
###197 And I believe that there was at least one more option to
###201 try before going to war.
###203 Israeli officials knew about the attempts of the ceasefire
###206 that we were trying to develop.
###207 They were well aware, and they didn't try it.
###209 
###214 SIMON OSTROVSKY: We're in Rishon Lezion, a town in
###217 central Israel.
###218 And this building was hit by a rocket fired by Hamas about an
###222 hour and a half ago.
###224 We're almost 60 kilometers away from the border with the
###227 Gaza Strip.
###228 Hamas are trying to show the Israelis that they can hit the
###232 country right in its center.
###234 This part of the country hasn't been hit for 20 years.
###237 And this has kind of been a wake up call for Israel.
###240 
###262 SIMON OSTROVSKY: They destroyed
###263 your house, your home.
###265 SIMON OSTROVSKY: What do you want your country to do now?
###267 
###275 SIMON OSTROVSKY: The next day, we heard that a bomb exploded
###278 on a bus in Tel Aviv.
###280 Officials didn't yet know if Hamas had planted it, but
###283 there were already reports of injuries.
###285 The conflict had entered a new phase.
###287 It wasn't just rockets coming out of Gaza anymore.
###290 There were now bombs being placed on public
###292 transportation.
###294 We headed south, back to Gaza in
###296 anticipation of Israel's reaction.
###298 It was the eighth day of open hostilities.
###301 And Israel's troops weren't showing any sign of getting
###304 ready to go.
###305 [GUNSHOT]
###305 Jesus.
###306 Fuck.
###310 SIMON OSTROVSKY: No filming?
###312 OK, sorry.
###313 
###318 SIMON OSTROVSKY: And there seems to be some
###319 rocket fire coming in.
###321 Because we've heard a couple of explosions just now.
###323 There's a really big troop build up just behind these
###327 trees over here.
###329 And we're only about a couple of kilometers away.
###331 So--
###331 [GUNSHOT]
###332 Fuck.
###333 Jesus Christ.
###335 Meanwhile in Egypt, mediators had finally gotten Israel and
###339 Hamas to agree to a ceasefire.
###340 
###347 So it's only a couple of minutes left until 9:00 when
###349 the ceasefire is supposed to come into effect.
###353 So far, we've seen rockets coming into Gaza, and
###357 exploding rockets coming out of Gaza.
###358 When the rockets have been coming in, these guys here
###360 have been cheering.
###361 They are not happy,
###362 apparently, about the ceasefire.
###364 Because they want to see Israel flatten Hamas in the
###367 Gaza Strip.
###369 But so far, it doesn't feel like the ceasefire is actually
###372 coming into effect.
###373 But we'll give it a couple more minutes.
###375 See what happens.
###377 [SPEAKING HEBREW]
###379 
###385 [SPEAKING HEBREW]
###387 
###394 [SPEAKING HEBREW]
###395 
###401 SIMON OSTROVSKY: And then everything went quiet.
###404 That is, aside from the celebratory gunfire in the
###407 Gaza Strip and the muezzins calling from the mosques.
###411 10 minutes, and you can hear soldiers in the field between
###415 here and Gaza cheering about it.
###420 Haven't heard any rockets explode.
###422 Haven't heard anything come in or go out of Gaza.
###424 So I guess this one's over.
###428 And we'll see you in a couple of years when
###430 the next round happens.
###433
