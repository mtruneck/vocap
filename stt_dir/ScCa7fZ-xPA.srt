3
0:0:27,61 --> 0:0:29,57
A really fun thing to do
is watch them run.


4
0:0:29,57 --> 0:0:38,83



5
0:0:38,83 --> 0:0:41,18
This is the family farm
in Massachusetts.


6
0:0:41,18 --> 0:0:43,21
Been here for about 20 years.


7
0:0:43,21 --> 0:0:44,83
These goats, they're
three brothers.


8
0:0:44,83 --> 0:0:47,33
They're Nigerian pygmy goats.


9
0:0:47,33 --> 0:0:48,37
They are African.


10
0:0:48,37 --> 0:0:50,95
They're used to really hot
climates, so they do really


11
0:0:50,95 --> 0:0:52,83
well in the summertime.


12
0:0:52,83 --> 0:0:55,62
Right now, at about six, seven
months, their guts, their


13
0:0:55,62 --> 0:0:58,46
stomachs get a little rounder
on the sides.


14
0:0:58,46 --> 0:1:0,295
But for the most part,
they stay that size.


15
0:1:0,295 --> 0:1:3,42



16
0:1:3,42 --> 0:1:7,79
So this is Morning, this is
Noon, and this is Night.


17
0:1:7,79 --> 0:1:12,33
Night is sort of the ringleader
of the gang here.


18
0:1:12,33 --> 0:1:14,66
They have back teeth, and most
of the time they just kind of


19
0:1:14,66 --> 0:1:17,64
grab the food with their lips,
so you don't really ever get


20
0:1:17,64 --> 0:1:19,895
bit unless you really stick
your finger in there.


21
0:1:19,895 --> 0:1:23,56
And they're very, very gentle.


22
0:1:23,56 --> 0:1:26,74
They're bred off dairy goats,
but these guys don't produce


23
0:1:26,74 --> 0:1:27,94
milk or anything.


24
0:1:27,94 --> 0:1:31,54
They're completely just
for show and for fun.


25
0:1:31,54 --> 0:1:33,45
We have blueberry bushes,
raspberry


26
0:1:33,45 --> 0:1:37,27
bushes, and this grapevine.


27
0:1:37,27 --> 0:1:38,65
They really like these leaves.


28
0:1:38,65 --> 0:1:39,58
They're very bitter.


29
0:1:39,58 --> 0:1:42,38
They don't eat the grapes, it's
too sour for them, but


30
0:1:42,38 --> 0:1:43,64
the leaves are bitter enough.


31
0:1:43,64 --> 0:1:44,68
And they like the texture.


32
0:1:44,68 --> 0:1:48,0
They also like, too, if you rake
up in the fall a lot of


33
0:1:48,0 --> 0:1:49,99
dead leaves and put
them in bags.


34
0:1:49,99 --> 0:1:50,695
They like crunchy.


35
0:1:50,695 --> 0:1:52,36
They like the texture.

39
0:2:24,69 --> 0:2:27,42
Cy usually follows these guys
around and kind of herds them


40
0:2:27,42 --> 0:2:27,95
a little bit.


41
0:2:27,95 --> 0:2:31,76
But as he is right behind them,
they drop out their


42
0:2:31,76 --> 0:2:37,22
little pachinko chips out of
their butts, he definitely


43
0:2:37,22 --> 0:2:39,3
will eat them.


44
0:2:39,3 --> 0:2:41,54
We have about 30 chickens.


45
0:2:41,54 --> 0:2:42,58
We've got our dog.


46
0:2:42,58 --> 0:2:45,5
We have a big fish pond where
we do koi and catfish.


47
0:2:45,5 --> 0:2:49,4
We've got a big rooster,
and about 25 hens.


48
0:2:49,4 --> 0:2:50,66
So we've got about--


49
0:2:50,66 --> 0:2:55,44
looking at 18 eggs every
30 hours or so.


50
0:2:55,44 --> 0:2:57,37
What's really cool about living
in a farming community


51
0:2:57,37 --> 0:3:1,1
is that you can barter and
trade, and sort of connect


52
0:3:1,1 --> 0:3:4,52
with your community by
giving your eggs


53
0:3:4,52 --> 0:3:5,77
away and trading them.
