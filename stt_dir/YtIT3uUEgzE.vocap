###14 SUROOSH ALVI: In Karachi, politics is a contact sport,
###17 and members of Pakistan's dozens of political parties
###20 have been known to put more trust in
###21 bullets than in ballots.
###24 Mob violence, bombings, and assassinations are sadly par
###28 for the course here.
###30 And while political leaders are often targeted, the rank
###33 and file suffer the consequences, too.
###35 We are driving into the ANP stronghold.
###38 It's the Awami National Party.
###40 On this side is the ANP.
###41 On this side is the MQM stronghold.
###44 And apparently, they have a lot of beef, because they
###46 shoot each other.
###49 We met up with Hamza Khan, one of the local
###51 leaders of the ANP.
###53 The ANP are the largest party representing Pashtuns, the
###56 Pashto-speaking ethnic group concentrated in Pakistan and
###59 Afghanistan.
###61 He took us out onto the main road.
###63 This corridor often turns into a kind of shooting gallery
###65 between these two rival groups, as evidenced by the
###68 bullet holes throughout the neighborhood.
###71 And why aren't you worried that people won't
###74 shoot at us right now?
###76 
###84 MALE SPEAKER: Maybe we should go up, then,
###85 as soon as we can.
###86 Maybe we should make our way to the top.
###87 
###90 SUROOSH ALVI: Allah is with us.
###90 We'll be OK, Insha'Allah.
###91 
###99 From the high vantage point, not only could we see the line
###102 that separates these two neighborhoods, but we could
###105 finally see what they were so often fighting for--
###108 land.
###109 That is, the lack of it.
###111 Land is the most precious commodity in Karachi, a city
###114 that has grown exponentially in recent decades.
###117 So while Pakistani politics are often organized around
###120 ethnic or interest groups, in Karachi, what most of those
###124 groups want is more land.
###126 
###145 SUROOSH ALVI: The MQM is a party that was founded to
###147 represent the Urdu-speaking Muslims whose families
###149 migrated to Pakistan from India.
###152 We headed to the heavily barricaded neighborhood that's
###154 home to MQM headquarters.
###157 The neighborhood was plastered with images of the MQM's
###159 charismatic leader, Altaf Hussain.
###162 This one is awesome, by the way.
###164 It looks like all album covers.
###166 That's his psychedelic era.
###169 MALE SPEAKER: Look at him over here, he's into iris.
###171 SUROOSH ALVI: This one, he's trying to go for the Che
###172 Guevara vibe.
###173 MALE SPEAKER: Mary J.
###176 SUROOSH ALVI: Because he fears assassination, Hussain
###178 communicates with his followers via Skype from his
###181 home in London.
###183 So instead, we met with the Minister for Youth Affairs,
###185 Faisal Sabzwari.
###187 
###189 We were in the kind ANP neighborhood yesterday--
###194 Kati Pahari-- and they don't like the MQM
###196 too much over there.
###198 They accuse MQM of terrorism.
###202 FAISAL SABZWARI: The issue with ANP in Karachi has been
###206 that some thugs and goons have been
###209 running the show in Karachi.
###211 Extortion, kidnapping for ransom, drug money--
###215 that's what some people under the flag of
###217 ANP have been doing.
###218 SUROOSH ALVI: You can call them thugs and goons, but I
###220 think MQM, also, people are intimidated by, because there
###224 are thugs and goons on your side as well.
###227 FAISAL SABZWARI: No, I reject that idea as well.
###229 We have no such kind of a group of people yet.
###235 SUROOSH ALVI: There's no military or--
###236 FAISAL SABZWARI: No way--
###237 yet.
###238 Yet.
###239 There are areas.
###239 If you have visited Kati Pahari, people in those
###242 particular areas are forced to carry out.
###245 Why?
###246 Because we are living amongst those fanatics, amongst those
###252 people who have no respect to human life, whose politics is
###257 only commercialized interest.
###261 SUROOSH ALVI: So the short version of all this is that
###262 people are getting killed in Karachi every day.
###265 There's gang violence, tons of mafia, sectarian killings, and
###268 in more recent years, suicide bombings.
###271 For the political parties, it's a massive turf war.
###274 And while politicians and businessmen would never admit
###276 that they engage in assassinating their rivals,
###279 someone is hiring the so-called target killers.
###283 We wanted to interview one of the men responsible for this
###285 dirty work, so we arranged a meeting with a target killer.
###289 It was uncomfortable for everyone involved.
###292 We negotiated the terms of the interview--
###294 in a moving car and with his motorcycle helmet on.
###298 And not surprisingly, the guy who kills people for money, he
###301 wanted to get paid.
###303 SUROOSH ALVI: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###305 
###312 TARGET KILLER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###313 
###466 SUROOSH ALVI: It's been at my feet the whole time.
###468 
###474 [FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###476 
###482 MALE SPEAKER: Yep.
###483 SUROOSH ALVI: Thank you.
###484 
###489 That was--
###490 
###493 yeah.
###494 That was really strange, sitting next to someone who's
###503 killed 35 people.
###504 And you could just tell from his demeanor and from his eyes
###508 he was a hard dude.
###509 And there's 600 guys like that roaming around this city.
###515 Anytime anyone has beef to settle with someone else, they
###520 want to kill them, just hire one of these guys, don't pay
###522 them much money, and they'll do the work.
###526 It's lawless, wild, and chaotic here.
###531 And that is some scary shit.
###535 
###542 And on a lighter note, two thieves got shot and killed.
###545 They're going to go pick the bodies up, and they've
###548 inviting us to go along.
###550 One thing had become clear on this trip--
###552 there's no shortage of murder and mayhem in Karachi.
###557 Between the gangs and the cops and the politicians and the
###560 target killers, this was definitely one of the craziest
###563 cities in the world.
###565 But that's coming from me.
###567 I asked the ambulance driver, a native Karachiite, how he'd
###571 describe the city.
###572 AMBULANCE DRIVER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE[
###573 
###578 SUROOSH ALVI: And that's when I realized it was time to go--
###581 [FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###584 SUROOSH ALVI: --that if we didn't quit while we were
###586 ahead, we'd just wind up on some hamster wheel of violence
###589 and corruption until we, too were dead--
###592 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###594 SUROOSH ALVI: --just another statistic in the most
###596 gangster-ific city in Pakistan.
