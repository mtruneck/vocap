###0 OJ: Today, a nerd teaches us about hip hop.
###2 We find out how great cleavage can make you a YouTube star.
###4 And we get higher than we've ever been with a
###7 trip to outer space.
###8 MALE SPEAKER: Vice Today.
###9 Bi-weekly, bite-sized doses of sex, drugs, and rock 'n roll.

###19 OJ: Welcome to another edition of Vice Today.
###21 I'm OJ, filling in for Ryan Duffy, who is either sick or
###24 has been kidnapped by the Legion of Doom.
###26 On this episode, we meet another one of our weird and
###29 wonderful friends from the internet, the Reply Girl, in
###32 the third installment of My Life Online.
###34 Then we find out about the future of interior design in
###37 outer space with our premiere episode of Spaced Out.
###41 But first, we check in with our favorite office house
###43 plant, Hanson O'Haver, for another installment of What's
###46 Up with Drake?
###47 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###51 HANSON O'HAVER: Hey, I'm Hanson O'Haver.
###52 So Drake did a couple of interviews recently where he
###55 talked about some hot button issues.
###57 In one, he talked about his substance use, which is
###59 basically that he smokes pot occasionally, drinks a little
###63 bit of wine, and occasionally sips lean.
###66 And then in another interview, he talked about how he's
###69 single, but he's definitely looking for the one.
###71 I think that when you compare these statements to like, for
###74 example, the recent GQ Rick Ross interview, which was like
###78 six pages of just Mercedes and strippers and just like sex
###83 rooms and food and so much weed, it sort of gets at a
###87 larger point about Drake's relatability.
###89 I think that the most interesting part of "Take
###91 Care" is probably when the heartfelt voicemail from his
###94 grandma segs into the beat from "Back That Azz Up."
###97 But a close runner up, I think, is when he says, I've
###101 had sex four times this week.
###102 I'll explain.
###103 Because even assuming that he's talking about four
###106 different people, it's not that much sex.
###109 I mean, Drake's a very famous guy, and presumably millions
###112 of women want to have sex with him.
###113 Whereas, I feel confident that there's probably someone in
###116 this office that has had sex with four people this week.
###119 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###123 OJ: You know what, he's not a house plant.
###124 He's actually a fern.
###126 Next up, we travel to Montreal, where we met with
###129 Alejandra Gaitan, who makes her living on the
###131 footnotes of YouTube.
###132 This is My Life Online.
###133 
###136 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###140 ALEJANDRA GAITAN: So, hi everyone.
###141 I just saw this video about a dog
###143 REPLY GIRL 1: --at a vet's office?
###145 REPLY GIRL 2: --giving his--
###146 the person behind the register a receipt.
###149 ALEJANDRA GAITAN: It's just really, really--
###150 REPLY GIRL 1: --cute.
###151 REPLY GIRL 3: -So anyways--
###153 yeah.
###156 MALE YOUTUBER 1: There's a trend happening on YouTube
###157 right now which is basically just a bunch of fat-tittied
###159 girls making stupid-ass reply videos to
###161 everything that comes up.
###163 MALE YOUTUBER 2: They're flipping everywhere, even on
###164 this video because it's about reply girls.
###167 There will be about five down here to the left of me.
###170 You look down in related videos, there'll probably be
###171 some reply girls there.
###172 THE LUCHADOR: They do shitty videos.
###174 They're completely terrible.
###176 MALE YOUTUBER 1: Just these girls yapping nonsense for
###178 long enough to fit an ad in so they can make money.
###181 THE LUCHADOR: People take hours and hours and hours to
###183 produce a quality video and original content.
###185 And they just pretty much watch it for pride.
###188 And they get 100 times what I would get in
###191 views, and like this.
###193 MALE YOUTUBER 2: The end result is
###194 almost painful to watch.
###196 MALE YOUTUBER 4: Oh, hey guys.
###198 MALE SPEAKER: Oh, they made me so hot.
###200 -[SPEAKING GERMAN]
###203 -[SPEAKING GERMAN]
###204 
###206 ALEJANDRA GAITAN: Peace and love, guys.
###207 See ya.
###208 Thank you very much for watching.
###209 Bye.
###211 
###214 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###218 ALEJANDRA GAITAN: Now, in case you don't know me, I am The
###221 Reply Girl, probably one of YouTube most hated
###226 personalities right now.
###228 [SPEAKING SPANISH]
###231 When I started YouTubing, I was below the poverty line,
###235 and I really, really, really needed a way to get out of
###240 that situation.
###241 Hi guys.
###242 My first month, I made enough to pay a cell phone bill.
###245 It was-- and I worked so much.
###247 Well, it's very simple.
###250 You go on YouTube, and you look for the
###252 videos that are trending.
###254 I like those that are like random and funny.
###259 -Good morning, Senor Luchador.
###261 I brought you breakfast with lots and lots of bacon.
###265 [SHOUTING]
###268 THE LUCHADOR: Alejandra, well, to be honest, she is my
###270 girlfriend's sister.
###271 And all considered, she's my YouTube mentor.
###276 -Hey guys, I just--
###277 THE LUCHADOR (OFFSCREEN): Reply Girl, Reply Girl, I need
###278 some advice.
###279 Haters are trying to get at me.
###280 And you know what, I got to go break their necks one by one.
###282 
###285 THE LUCHADOR: So what happened was that she
###287 showed me her check.
###289 And it was a nice check.
###290 For what she does, it was a very, very beautiful check.
###294 ALEJANDRA GAITAN: I always wanted to be an autonomous
###297 worker or have a company or make money on my
###303 own, be my own boss.
###306 And I just never knew what exactly I wanted to
###311 do to make it happen.
###312 I just knew I wanted--
###315 I want it to happen.
###316 I started programming but that didn't work out very well
###321 because I'm not--
###323 I'm not a very good programmer.
###326 And I also did some babysitting, but
###331 that's how it is.
###333 THE LUCHADOR: I tried doing replies myself.
###336 And believe it or not, it's a harder job than
###338 you think it is.
###339 It's long, it's boring, tedious.
###342 It's annoying.
###343 I mean, it's not a fun job.
###345 And the haters, the people out there who are hating on reply
###348 people and like, oh, what they do is brainless.
###351 You know what, do it yourself.
###352 If you don't like it, don't do it and don't watch it.
###354 Simple as that.
###356 There's times that these haters, they're posting videos
###361 and threats about finding her address, her IP address, and
###363 knowing where she lives.
###365 I've seen posts on YouTube, people actually posting, and
###369 they thought that they found her address.
###370 And they post it everywhere.
###372 What kind of a bad person are you to take a hated person's
###378 address and post it to the public?
###380 So someone, some crazy person comes over and sees the
###383 address and does something that they're going to
###385 regret later on.
###388 Oh, Jesus.
###389 If only they knew.
###390 I'm waiting.
###392 
###398 OJ: Geez, that was really sad, but I was kind of distracted
###402 by something else.
###404 And finally, we check in with those crazy, underfunded nerds
###407 at NASA to find out what their interior designers have in
###410 store for us once Earth has become a barren wasteland.
###413 This is the series premier of Spaced Out.
###415 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###419 EVAN TWYFORD: Three-dimensional design, for
###421 me, was always kind of the greatest form of creation,
###425 being able to take an idea from that very tiny amount of
###429 energy, being this idea in your head, and then
###432 formulating that into a fully functional
###434 three-dimensional product.
###436 Take that step further, I always kind of wanted to
###438 design the ultimate
###440 three-dimensional object, right?
###442 And so, designing space vehicles, to me, was like that
###446 ultimate form of creation.
###447 It's like, what's the most bad-ass thing you can design
###449 would be a spaceship.
###450 And NASA really was kind of the final frontier for me.
###456 
###465 My name's Evan Twyford, and I'm a habitability designer at
###469 NASA's Johnson Space Center.
###470 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###477 EVAN TWYFORD: We, in our group, do conceptual design
###480 for NASA's Human Space Flight.
###482 A lot of these projects are coming down as major, kind of
###487 campaign-level design projects where they're saying, hey,
###490 we're doing a mission to the moon.
###492 We're working on a pressurized rover.
###495 We've got this idea, and we want you guys to
###497 help us make it happen.
###498 So starting off with sketching and rendering, very
###500 conceptual, take it to a full-scale, mock-up phase out
###505 of wood, foam core, low-fidelity materials.
###509 We use those to kind of sketch out the volume of how big the
###512 vehicle might be and how it might feel on the inside.
###516 Part of what we'll do when we're designing a habitat is
###519 we'll look at how the corners, how the edges are treated,
###522 what type of paint schemes are going to go inside.
###524 There was actually an issue with one of the colors that
###526 they had painted on the International Space Station,
###528 where one of the hatches was like a salmon color.
###532 And the crew really disliked it, so we try to
###535 avoid salmon now.
###537 And then working out the details in a CAD system on the
###539 computer and developing a fully-functional prototype.
###543 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###547 EVAN TWYFORD: The type of design at NASA that we do kind
###550 of crosses the line between fine art and engineering.
###553 So it's a lot more problem solving, though, which is what
###556 makes it really exciting.
###559 So this is the SEV, the Space Exploration Vehicle on the
###566 chassis, Gen1B.
###569 For interior design for space vehicles, there is certainly
###575 the problem of confinement, which is a psychological issue
###579 for crew members over time.
###581 So we have to deal with ways of designing environments and
###584 designing products that will reduce the effects of feelings
###591 of confinement in space.
###593 Yeah, so this is the interior of the SEV Rover, Gen1B.
###599 And most of the interior design elements was a product
###603 of our team, as well the robotics team that we've been
###606 working with on this vehicle for some time.
###609 And we've been charged with making the interior of the
###613 vehicle more comfortable and more luxurious, if you can
###617 call it that.
###618 [SPACE SOUNDS]
###623 EVAN TWYFORD: Seeing as most of us haven't actually been to
###625 outer space, it can make things very difficult
###628 sometimes because everybody has a different opinion, or
###630 different assumptions that they're making about what that
###633 experience is like.
###634 It's a very testing and evaluation-intensive work
###638 environment.
###639 So we have to do whatever we can to ensure that these
###643 products will work in their intended environment.
###645 So sometimes that means flying products or mock ups on a zero
###650 gravity flight in the parabolic aircraft.
###655 Sometimes it means going out into the desert and testing
###657 them in a very harsh kind of desolate environment that
###662 might be similar to what we would encounter in space.
###664 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###672 EVAN TWYFORD: There's always that kind of thing with
###673 designers between, are you going to be like a stylist or
###676 are you going to be a problem solver?
###678 And you can look at a product, and say this accomplishes
###684 exactly what we needed to accomplish, and that's what
###686 makes it beautiful, and that's what makes it successful.
###689 It's a very pure design problem that we're dealing
###692 with, which is to create products and environments that
###697 the crew will find useful and will make them successful and
###703 productive in their daily routines.
###707 MALE SPEAKER: Go for main engine start.
###709 T-minus 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5--
###716 all three engines up and burning--
###718 2, 1, 0, and lift off.
###722 The final lift off of Atlantis.
###723 
###726 EVAN TWYFORD: The shuttle program and the International
###728 Space Station were started in the '80s as sort of a
###733 longer-term analog for human space flight and establishing
###736 a permanent, human presence in space to start to learn more
###740 about how humans would behave and interact in longer-term
###745 space flight scenarios.
###747 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###756 EVAN TWYFORD: I kind of felt like a lot of people, in
###760 general, are maybe not as excited by the International
###764 Space Station or by the shuttle program, or at least
###768 not as much as they were maybe in the '80s when the shuttle
###770 was brand new.
###772 I just hope that we can really re-engage people in the right
###776 way, and get people excited about space flight because
###779 this next generation of space vehicles is going to be the
###781 most bad-ass that we've ever seen.
###785 OJ: Hope you enjoyed another episode of Vice Today.
