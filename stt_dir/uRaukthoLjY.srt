0:0:34,34 --> 0:0:39,13
This is 80--

0:0:39,13 --> 0:0:41,45
no, this is 90.


7
0:0:41,45 --> 0:0:43,11
Yeah, 90.


8
0:0:43,11 --> 0:0:45,14
It's a team board.


9
0:0:45,14 --> 0:0:47,58
All the team boards
were black.


10
0:0:47,58 --> 0:0:48,86
The earlier Sims boards--


11
0:0:48,86 --> 0:0:51,745
all the teams were black, except
for a very few protos


12
0:0:51,745 --> 0:0:52,66
that were white.


13
0:0:52,66 --> 0:0:53,9
And then, there's a couple
of red ones that


14
0:0:53,9 --> 0:0:55,3
are floating around.


15
0:0:55,3 --> 0:0:56,83
Those are back in
the archives.


16
0:0:56,83 --> 0:0:59,32
And I've got another
white one.


17
0:0:59,32 --> 0:1:2,3
I was one of the original
pipe guys.


18
0:1:2,3 --> 0:1:4,99
Every contest, I was
always in the pipe.


19
0:1:4,99 --> 0:1:6,86

go, you want to ride?

0:1:6,86 --> 0:1:8,27
Show up here.

0:1:8,27 --> 0:1:10,58
After practices is done,
be here with shovels.


22
0:1:10,58 --> 0:1:14,36
When the cat guy's done, then
we'll start shaping.


23
0:1:14,36 --> 0:1:17,0
And then, the hips and all the
rails, and stuff didn't come


24
0:1:17,0 --> 0:1:20,12
around until like '90, '91--


25
0:1:20,12 --> 0:1:20,94
just something different.


26
0:1:20,94 --> 0:1:22,91
I went, oh cool-- a little
twist on the original.


27
0:1:22,91 --> 0:1:24,83
Because we didn't do that
the first year or

TOM BURT: Mike Chantry, he was
kind of like our father figure


33
0:1:37,66 --> 0:1:40,48
to hold Tahoe's skate
team together.


34
0:1:40,48 --> 0:1:42,54
He had Mile High Ramp.


35
0:1:42,54 --> 0:1:46,88
And he kind of took care of
Terry, and was always at the


36
0:1:46,88 --> 0:1:49,61
contests, and became a judge.


37
0:1:49,61 --> 0:1:55,25
He's kind of like a local guy
who put it all together for


38
0:1:55,25 --> 0:1:59,71

quite a few years--

0:1:59,71 --> 0:2:3,32

to get their hands dirty.

51
0:2:26,99 --> 0:2:28,42

0:2:28,42 --> 0:2:29,68

0:2:36,183 --> 0:2:37,476
MIKE CHANTRY: Yup.


56
0:2:37,476 --> 0:2:38,86
Frank would do--


57
0:2:38,86 --> 0:2:41,27
He would kick ass on this.

definitely shoveled pipes.

for a new pipe that's not even
the top of a normal superpipe.

to make Jeff happy, I think.

is going to show?

taking guys like that and
bringing them into judging.

0:3:59,11 --> 0:4:1,11

90
0:4:1,11 --> 0:4:3,88

with skating.

invented the pipe dragon, and

back and do this crap.

they know where the

want to shovel


102
0:4:28,37 --> 0:4:30,61

103

in the beginning.

there's a shovel.

0:4:36,75 --> 0:4:38,72
T.S.


108
0:4:38,72 --> 0:4:41,62

Cat guy, dig it out--


109
0:4:41,62 --> 0:4:43,77
Tom Sims or myself.


110
0:4:43,77 --> 0:4:47,89
And we got the first
three pipes.


111
0:4:47,89 --> 0:4:49,6
And then, everybody would
show up to practice.


112
0:4:49,6 --> 0:4:50,31
We'd all give out shovels.


113
0:4:50,31 --> 0:4:52,88
And there'd be 30 to 50 guys
with shovels running around

trannies and hits.


115
0:4:55,97 --> 0:5:0,635

like 100 hits, freeways all


116
0:5:0,635 --> 0:5:1,81

117
0:5:1,81 --> 0:5:3,82

wanted to go, you still


118

had an option.

NORM SAYLER: When Don and
Danielle Bostick came to


130
0:5:24,24 --> 0:5:30,1
Donner Ski Ranch and came to
work for me, I was the major


131
0:5:30,1 --> 0:5:33,94
owner along with my wife
and my family.


132
0:5:33,94 --> 0:5:35,81
And I had a lot of
stockholders.


133
0:5:35,81 --> 0:5:37,67
And we were all home-bred
stockholders.


134
0:5:37,67 --> 0:5:40,27
This was just a family place.


135
0:5:40,27 --> 0:5:43,36
The stockholders would come and
help paint, fix, cook if I


136
0:5:43,36 --> 0:5:45,59
needed a bartender, needed
a dishwasher.


137
0:5:45,59 --> 0:5:48,24
That's the way this place was
in the original days.


138
0:5:48,24 --> 0:5:51,68
When I took over in 1958, I got
on the phone and called


139
0:5:51,68 --> 0:5:53,84
all my friends and said, I'm
running Donner's Ski Ranch--


140
0:5:53,84 --> 0:5:54,55
help.


141
0:5:54,55 --> 0:5:55,94
And they all showed up.


142
0:5:55,94 --> 0:5:57,62
And that's how we got
the place going.


143
0:5:57,62 --> 0:6:2,8
But when Don and Danielle showed
up, that was the start


144
0:6:2,8 --> 0:6:3,3
of doing things.


145
0:6:3,3 --> 0:6:4,52
And then, snowboarding
came along.


146
0:6:4,52 --> 0:6:5,85
And they stepped right
into that.


147
0:6:5,85 --> 0:6:7,61
Because they were
skateboarders.


148
0:6:7,61 --> 0:6:10,44
We went from 25,000
skier visits to


149
0:6:10,44 --> 0:6:13,48
54,000 in three years.


150
0:6:13,48 --> 0:6:14,6
That's how much it increased.


151
0:6:14,6 --> 0:6:17,94
And all of that, basically,
was snowboarding.


152
0:6:17,94 --> 0:6:20,28
We didn't know this was
going to happen.


153
0:6:20,28 --> 0:6:21,94
Didn't have a clue.


154
0:6:21,94 --> 0:6:24,85
Every snowboarder would show
up with their snowboard and


155
0:6:24,85 --> 0:6:25,39
their shovel.


156
0:6:25,39 --> 0:6:27,21
And they'd start working
on the pipe.


157
0:6:27,21 --> 0:6:30,13
And what you're looking at is
truly about what it was.


158
0:6:30,13 --> 0:6:33,3
So everybody would put in
their individual hit.


159
0:6:33,3 --> 0:6:34,43
This was the place they're
going to do


160
0:6:34,43 --> 0:6:35,66
their trick and stuff.


161
0:6:35,66 --> 0:6:36,84
And that's what it was.


162
0:6:36,84 --> 0:6:38,34
And you can see today there was
a lot of hand shovelling


163
0:6:38,34 --> 0:6:39,24
on this pipe.


164
0:6:39,24 --> 0:6:41,11
And that's what made it.


165
0:6:41,11 --> 0:6:44,8
But I'm a little disappointed
now.


166
0:6:44,8 --> 0:6:49,385
Because it's kind of lost that
really homegrown attitude that


167
0:6:49,385 --> 0:6:52,62
it had early on, when
the kids just came


168
0:6:52,62 --> 0:6:54,6
hardcore to have fun.


169
0:6:54,6 --> 0:6:56,33
They were all street wise.


170
0:6:56,33 --> 0:6:58,19
They plain came and said--


171
0:6:58,19 --> 0:6:59,31
I don't know if I
can say this.


172
0:6:59,31 --> 0:7:0,63
You can take it out--


173
0:7:0,63 --> 0:7:2,86
they just plain said,
fuck you.


174
0:7:2,86 --> 0:7:4,14
We're going to have fun.


175
0:7:4,14 --> 0:7:4,99
Leave us alone.


176
0:7:4,99 --> 0:7:6,19
And I says, give me $10.


177
0:7:6,19 --> 0:7:7,91
And I'll leave you alone
all day long.


178
0:7:7,91 --> 0:7:11,9
And this is kind of a place
that really helped get it


179
0:7:11,9 --> 0:7:12,26
started with them.


180
0:7:12,26 --> 0:7:15,35
But without their help, it might
have been a lot harder,


181
0:7:15,35 --> 0:7:17,11
might have been a few
years in coming.


182
0:7:17,11 --> 0:7:18,53

happened as quick.
