1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:1,61



2
0:0:1,61 --> 0:0:3,14
MALE SPEAKER:
Welcome, everybody.


3
0:0:3,14 --> 0:0:7,62
Six days ago, astronaut
Mark Whatrey--


4
0:0:7,62 --> 0:0:8,37
ANDY WEIR: Watney.


5
0:0:8,37 --> 0:0:10,42
MALE SPEAKER: --became
one of the first men


6
0:0:10,42 --> 0:0:12,92
to walk on the surface of Mars.


7
0:0:12,92 --> 0:0:16,39
Now he may be the
first man to die there.


8
0:0:16,39 --> 0:0:18,87
Will he?


9
0:0:18,87 --> 0:0:22,4
Andy Weir's brilliant
debut novel, "The Martian,"


10
0:0:22,4 --> 0:0:26,92
is a gripping story of
survival against all odds.


11
0:0:26,92 --> 0:0:29,48
The astronaut is stranded
millions of miles


12
0:0:29,48 --> 0:0:32,31
from the nearest human
being with no way


13
0:0:32,31 --> 0:0:35,45
to even signal Earth
that he is alive.


14
0:0:35,45 --> 0:0:37,45
And even if you he
could get word out,


15
0:0:37,45 --> 0:0:40,6
his food would be gone years
before a rescue mission could


16
0:0:40,6 --> 0:0:43,23
arrive.


17
0:0:43,23 --> 0:0:46,94
Andy Weir, he's our neighbor
here in Mountain View,


18
0:0:46,94 --> 0:0:48,45
a longtime programmer.


19
0:0:48,45 --> 0:0:53,88
He got his first job at 15 years
of age at Sandia National Labs.


20
0:0:53,88 --> 0:0:58,3
He wrote code for Warcraft II.


21
0:0:58,3 --> 0:1:1,1
And he's now working
at MobileIron,


22
0:1:1,1 --> 0:1:4,129
where he's working
on Android codes.


23
0:1:4,129 --> 0:1:8,25
And actually, we talked a little
bit how he likes the platform,


24
0:1:8,25 --> 0:1:12,11
and he didn't have
too many complaints.


25
0:1:12,11 --> 0:1:16,37
I guess this is kudos to you
guys from the Android group.


26
0:1:16,37 --> 0:1:23,8
I am pleased to present
the book, "The Martian."


27
0:1:23,8 --> 0:1:25,92
Andy will be talking
to us today about it


28
0:1:25,92 --> 0:1:29,14
and showing some of the
technical details that


29
0:1:29,14 --> 0:1:30,46
went into the book.


30
0:1:30,46 --> 0:1:31,96
And please give a warm welcome.


31
0:1:31,96 --> 0:1:38,39
[APPLAUSE]


32
0:1:38,39 --> 0:1:40,487
ANDY WEIR: So, like he
said, I'm Andy Weir.


33
0:1:40,487 --> 0:1:41,57
And I wrote "The Martian."


34
0:1:41,57 --> 0:1:45,177
I'm going to be talking
to you about that today.


35
0:1:45,177 --> 0:1:47,26
When they told me that I'd
be doing a Google Talk,


36
0:1:47,26 --> 0:1:48,91
they said, you're
going to want to make


37
0:1:48,91 --> 0:1:50,82
about 40 minutes of content.


38
0:1:50,82 --> 0:1:53,91
I don't think I'm going to
make 40 minutes of content.


39
0:1:53,91 --> 0:1:56,85
But I'll just say what I have
to say until I'm out of stuff


40
0:1:56,85 --> 0:2:0,57
to say, and then
I'll take questions.


41
0:2:0,57 --> 0:2:2,5
So you just got the
summary of the book.


42
0:2:2,5 --> 0:2:3,32
But I'm going to do a reading.


43
0:2:3,32 --> 0:2:4,49
I'm going to start us
off with a reading.


44
0:2:4,49 --> 0:2:5,82
And then I'm going to
start talking about some


45
0:2:5,82 --> 0:2:8,52
of the technical stuff that
went into making the book.


46
0:2:8,52 --> 0:2:11,0
The reading's going to
be about 10 minutes.


47
0:2:11,0 --> 0:2:14,41
And it's just the first chapter.


48
0:2:14,41 --> 0:2:17,62
So it's about four
or five pages.


49
0:2:17,62 --> 0:2:20,35
Also, the reading will
include profanities.


50
0:2:20,35 --> 0:2:21,67
I hope nobody's
bothered by that.


51
0:2:21,67 --> 0:2:23,56
I don't see any
children out there.


52
0:2:23,56 --> 0:2:27,63
So I'm just going
to jump right in.


53
0:2:27,63 --> 0:2:29,68
Log entry, Sol 6.


54
0:2:29,68 --> 0:2:31,15
I'm pretty much fucked.


55
0:2:31,15 --> 0:2:32,57
That's my considered opinion.


56
0:2:32,57 --> 0:2:33,94
Fucked.


57
0:2:33,94 --> 0:2:35,76
Six days into what should be the
greatest two months of my life,


58
0:2:35,76 --> 0:2:37,38
and it's turned
into a nightmare.


59
0:2:37,38 --> 0:2:38,53
I don't even know
who'll read this.


60
0:2:38,53 --> 0:2:40,196
I guess someone will
find it eventually,


61
0:2:40,196 --> 0:2:41,42
maybe 100 years from now.


62
0:2:41,42 --> 0:2:43,506
For the record, I
didn't die on Sol 6.


63
0:2:43,506 --> 0:2:45,38
Certainly the rest of
the crew thought I did.


64
0:2:45,38 --> 0:2:46,374
And I can't blame them.


65
0:2:46,374 --> 0:2:48,54
Maybe there'll be a day of
national mourning for me.


66
0:2:48,54 --> 0:2:50,29
And my Wikipedia page
will say Mark Watney


67
0:2:50,29 --> 0:2:52,65
is the only human being
to have died on Mars.


68
0:2:52,65 --> 0:2:53,87
And it'll be right, probably.


69
0:2:53,87 --> 0:2:55,17
Because I'll surely die here.


70
0:2:55,17 --> 0:2:57,78
Just not on Sol 6 when
everyone thinks I did.


71
0:2:57,78 --> 0:2:58,33
Let's see.


72
0:2:58,33 --> 0:2:59,57
Where do I begin?


73
0:2:59,57 --> 0:3:2,37
The Ares program-- mankind
reaching out to Mars


74
0:3:2,37 --> 0:3:4,37
to send people to another
planet for the very first time


75
0:3:4,37 --> 0:3:6,972
and expand the horizons of
humanity, blah, blah, blah.


76
0:3:6,972 --> 0:3:9,18
The Ares 1 crew did their
thing and came back heroes.


77
0:3:9,18 --> 0:3:11,58
They got the parades and
fame and love of the world.


78
0:3:11,58 --> 0:3:13,999
Ares 2 did the same thing in
a different location on Mars.


79
0:3:13,999 --> 0:3:16,4
They got a firm handshake
and a hot cup of coffee


80
0:3:16,4 --> 0:3:17,3
when they got home.


81
0:3:17,3 --> 0:3:18,3
Ares 3?


82
0:3:18,3 --> 0:3:19,23
Well, that's my mission.


83
0:3:19,23 --> 0:3:20,37
Well, not mine, per se.


84
0:3:20,37 --> 0:3:21,62
Commander Lewis was in charge.


85
0:3:21,62 --> 0:3:23,16
I was just one of her crew.


86
0:3:23,16 --> 0:3:25,642
Actually, I was the very lowest
ranked member of the crew.


87
0:3:25,642 --> 0:3:27,35
I would only be in
command of the mission


88
0:3:27,35 --> 0:3:28,86
if I were the only
remaining person.


89
0:3:28,86 --> 0:3:29,776
Hey, what do you know?


90
0:3:29,776 --> 0:3:31,4
I'm in command.


91
0:3:31,4 --> 0:3:32,9
I wonder if this
log'll be recovered


92
0:3:32,9 --> 0:3:34,749
before the rest of the
crew die of old age.


93
0:3:34,749 --> 0:3:36,54
I presume they got back
to Earth all right.


94
0:3:36,54 --> 0:3:38,46
Guys, if you're reading
this, it wasn't your fault.


95
0:3:38,46 --> 0:3:39,66
You did what you had to do.


96
0:3:39,66 --> 0:3:41,63
In your position, I would
have done the same thing.


97
0:3:41,63 --> 0:3:42,34
I don't blame you.


98
0:3:42,34 --> 0:3:43,423
And I'm glad you survived.


99
0:3:43,423 --> 0:3:45,782



100
0:3:45,782 --> 0:3:47,74
I guess I should explain
how Mars missions work


101
0:3:47,74 --> 0:3:49,58
for any laymen who
may be reading this.


102
0:3:49,58 --> 0:3:52,121
We got to Earth orbit the normal
way through an ordinary ship


103
0:3:52,121 --> 0:3:52,914
to "Hermes."


104
0:3:52,914 --> 0:3:54,33
All the Ares
missions use "Hermes"


105
0:3:54,33 --> 0:3:55,48
to get to and from Mars.


106
0:3:55,48 --> 0:3:58,754
It's really big and it cost a
lot, so NASA only built one.


107
0:3:58,754 --> 0:4:1,17
Once we got to "Hermes," four
additional unmanned missions


108
0:4:1,17 --> 0:4:3,52
brought us fuel and supplies
while we prepared for our trip.


109
0:4:3,52 --> 0:4:5,52
Once everything was a
"go," we set out for Mars,


110
0:4:5,52 --> 0:4:6,594
but not very fast.


111
0:4:6,594 --> 0:4:8,26
Gone are the days of
heavy chemical fuel


112
0:4:8,26 --> 0:4:10,32
burns and trans-Mars
injection orbits.


113
0:4:10,32 --> 0:4:11,792
"Hermes" is powered
by ion engines.


114
0:4:11,792 --> 0:4:13,5
They throw argon out
the back of the ship


115
0:4:13,5 --> 0:4:15,93
really fast to get a tiny
amount of acceleration.


116
0:4:15,93 --> 0:4:18,79
The thing is it doesn't
take much reactant mass.


117
0:4:18,79 --> 0:4:20,94
So a little argon and a
nuclear reactor to power things


118
0:4:20,94 --> 0:4:23,261
let us accelerate constantly
the whole way there.


119
0:4:23,261 --> 0:4:24,76
You'd be amazed how
fast you can get


120
0:4:24,76 --> 0:4:27,762
going with a tiny
acceleration over a long time.


121
0:4:27,762 --> 0:4:29,97
I could regale you with
tales of how we had great fun


122
0:4:29,97 --> 0:4:31,132
on the trip, but I won't.


123
0:4:31,132 --> 0:4:32,84
I don't feel like
re-living it right now.


124
0:4:32,84 --> 0:4:35,8
Suffice it to say we
got to Mars 124 days


125
0:4:35,8 --> 0:4:36,97
later without
strangling each other.


126
0:4:36,97 --> 0:4:39,56
From there we took the
MDV, Mars Descent Vehicle,


127
0:4:39,56 --> 0:4:40,56
to the surface.


128
0:4:40,56 --> 0:4:42,98
The MDV is basically a big
can with some light thrusters


129
0:4:42,98 --> 0:4:44,1
and parachutes attached.


130
0:4:44,1 --> 0:4:46,32
Its sole purpose is to get
six humans from Mars orbit


131
0:4:46,32 --> 0:4:48,199
to the surface without
killing any of them.


132
0:4:48,199 --> 0:4:50,49
And now we come to the real
trick of Mars exploration--


133
0:4:50,49 --> 0:4:52,37
having all your shit
there in advance.


134
0:4:52,37 --> 0:4:54,85
A total of 14 unmanned
missions deposited everything


135
0:4:54,85 --> 0:4:56,392
we would need for
surface operations.


136
0:4:56,392 --> 0:4:58,183
They tried their best
to land on the supply


137
0:4:58,183 --> 0:5:0,819
vessels in the same general area
and did a reasonably good job.


138
0:5:0,819 --> 0:5:2,61
Supplies aren't nearly
so fragile as humans


139
0:5:2,61 --> 0:5:4,17
and can hit the
ground really hard,


140
0:5:4,17 --> 0:5:5,829
but they tend to
bounce around a lot.


141
0:5:5,829 --> 0:5:7,37
Naturally they didn't
send us to Mars


142
0:5:7,37 --> 0:5:9,16
until they confirmed that
all the supplies had made it


143
0:5:9,16 --> 0:5:11,368
to the surface and their
containers weren't breached.


144
0:5:11,368 --> 0:5:13,33
Start to finish,
including supply missions,


145
0:5:13,33 --> 0:5:15,52
a Mars mission takes
about three years.


146
0:5:15,52 --> 0:5:17,89
In fact, there were Ares 3
supplies en route to Mars


147
0:5:17,89 --> 0:5:20,441
while the Ares 2 crew
were on their way home.


148
0:5:20,441 --> 0:5:22,94
The most important piece of the
advance supplies, of course,


149
0:5:22,94 --> 0:5:25,314
was the MAV, the
Mars Ascent Vehicle.


150
0:5:25,314 --> 0:5:26,98
That's how we would
get back to "Hermes"


151
0:5:26,98 --> 0:5:28,72
after surface operations
were complete.


152
0:5:28,72 --> 0:5:31,7
The MAV was soft landed
as opposed to the balloon


153
0:5:31,7 --> 0:5:32,705
bounce fest the
other supplies had.


154
0:5:32,705 --> 0:5:35,8
Of course, it was in constant
communication with Houston,


155
0:5:35,8 --> 0:5:36,91
and if there had been
any problems with it,


156
0:5:36,91 --> 0:5:39,77
we would have passed by Mars and
gone home without ever landing.


157
0:5:39,77 --> 0:5:41,7
The MAV is pretty cool.


158
0:5:41,7 --> 0:5:42,93
It turns out through a neat
set of chemical reactions


159
0:5:42,93 --> 0:5:45,388
with the Martian atmosphere,
for every kilogram of hydrogen


160
0:5:45,388 --> 0:5:48,74
you bring to Mars, you can
make 13 kilograms of fuel.


161
0:5:48,74 --> 0:5:49,24
It's a slow process, though.


162
0:5:49,24 --> 0:5:51,5
It takes 24 months
to fill the tank.


163
0:5:51,5 --> 0:5:53,29
That's why they sent it
long before we got there.


164
0:5:53,29 --> 0:5:54,706
You can imagine
how disappointed I


165
0:5:54,706 --> 0:5:57,352
was when I discovered
the MAV was gone.


166
0:5:57,352 --> 0:5:59,56
It was a ridiculous sequence
of events that led to me


167
0:5:59,56 --> 0:6:1,851
almost dying, and an even
more ridiculous sequence that


168
0:6:1,851 --> 0:6:2,77
led to me surviving.


169
0:6:2,77 --> 0:6:4,144
The mission is
designed to handle


170
0:6:4,144 --> 0:6:6,539
sandstorm gusts
of up to 150 KPH.


171
0:6:6,539 --> 0:6:8,8
So Houston got
understandably nervous


172
0:6:8,8 --> 0:6:10,67
when we got whacked
with 175 KPH winds.


173
0:6:10,67 --> 0:6:12,42
We all got in our
flight suits and huddled


174
0:6:12,42 --> 0:6:14,711
in the middle of the Hab just
in case it lost pressure.


175
0:6:14,711 --> 0:6:16,18
But they Hab wasn't the problem.


176
0:6:16,18 --> 0:6:17,289
The MAV is a spaceship.


177
0:6:17,289 --> 0:6:18,58
It has a lot of delicate parts.


178
0:6:18,58 --> 0:6:20,496
It can put up with storms
to a certain extent,


179
0:6:20,496 --> 0:6:22,34
but it can't just get
sand blasted forever.


180
0:6:22,34 --> 0:6:24,131
After an hour and a
half of sustained wind,


181
0:6:24,131 --> 0:6:25,34
NASA gave the order to abort.


182
0:6:25,34 --> 0:6:27,547
Nobody wanted to stop a
month-long mission after only


183
0:6:27,547 --> 0:6:29,68
six days, but if the MAV
took any more punishment,


184
0:6:29,68 --> 0:6:32,35
we'd have all gotten
stranded down there.


185
0:6:32,35 --> 0:6:34,96
We had to go out in the storm
to get from the Hab to the MAV.


186
0:6:34,96 --> 0:6:36,251
And that was going to be risky.


187
0:6:36,251 --> 0:6:37,59
But what choice did we have?


188
0:6:37,59 --> 0:6:39,29
Everyone made it but me.


189
0:6:39,29 --> 0:6:41,52
Our main communications
dish, which relayed signals


190
0:6:41,52 --> 0:6:43,68
from the Hab to "Hermes,"
acted like a parachute getting


191
0:6:43,68 --> 0:6:45,94
torn from its foundation and
carried with the torrent.


192
0:6:45,94 --> 0:6:47,77
Along the way, it crashed
through the reception antenna


193
0:6:47,77 --> 0:6:48,299
array.


194
0:6:48,299 --> 0:6:49,84
Then one of those
long, thin antennae


195
0:6:49,84 --> 0:6:51,27
slammed into me end first.


196
0:6:51,27 --> 0:6:53,54
It tore through my suit like
a bullet through butter.


197
0:6:53,54 --> 0:6:56,494
And I felt the worst pain in my
life as it ripped open my side.


198
0:6:56,494 --> 0:6:58,41
I vaguely remember having
the wind knocked out


199
0:6:58,41 --> 0:6:59,91
of me-- pulled out
of me, really--


200
0:6:59,91 --> 0:7:1,785
and my ears popping
painfully is the pressure


201
0:7:1,785 --> 0:7:2,63
in my suit escaped.


202
0:7:2,63 --> 0:7:4,546
The last thing I remember
was seeing Johanssen


203
0:7:4,546 --> 0:7:6,68
hopelessly reaching
out toward me.


204
0:7:6,68 --> 0:7:8,52
I awoke to an oxygen
alarm in my suit,


205
0:7:8,52 --> 0:7:10,27
a steady obnoxious
beeping that aroused me


206
0:7:10,27 --> 0:7:14,66
from a deep and profound
desire to just fucking die.


207
0:7:14,66 --> 0:7:15,56
The storm had abated.


208
0:7:15,56 --> 0:7:17,8
I was face down, almost
totally buried in sand.


209
0:7:17,8 --> 0:7:19,21
As I groggily came
to, I wondered


210
0:7:19,21 --> 0:7:21,119
why I wasn't more dead.


211
0:7:21,119 --> 0:7:22,66
The antenna had
enough force to punch


212
0:7:22,66 --> 0:7:24,2
through the suit
and my side, but it


213
0:7:24,2 --> 0:7:25,31
had been stopped by my pelvis.


214
0:7:25,31 --> 0:7:26,976
So there was only one
hole in the suit--


215
0:7:26,976 --> 0:7:29,43
and a hole in me, of course.


216
0:7:29,43 --> 0:7:30,9
I'd been knocked
back quite a ways


217
0:7:30,9 --> 0:7:32,108
and rolled down a steep hill.


218
0:7:32,108 --> 0:7:33,49
Somehow I landed
face down, which


219
0:7:33,49 --> 0:7:35,62
forced the antenna into a
strongly oblique angle that


220
0:7:35,62 --> 0:7:37,453
put a lot of torque on
the hole in the suit.


221
0:7:37,453 --> 0:7:38,61
It made a weak seal.


222
0:7:38,61 --> 0:7:40,11
Then the copious
blood from my wound


223
0:7:40,11 --> 0:7:41,23
trickled down toward the hole.


224
0:7:41,23 --> 0:7:43,2
As the blood reached the site
of the breach, the water in it


225
0:7:43,2 --> 0:7:45,7
quickly evaporated from the
air flow and low pressure,


226
0:7:45,7 --> 0:7:47,374
leaving a gunky residue behind.


227
0:7:47,374 --> 0:7:49,79
More blood came in behind it
and was also reduced to gunk.


228
0:7:49,79 --> 0:7:51,45
Eventually it sealed
the gaps around the hole


229
0:7:51,45 --> 0:7:52,824
and reduced the
leak to something


230
0:7:52,824 --> 0:7:54,68
the suit could counteract.


231
0:7:54,68 --> 0:7:56,374
The suit did its job admirably.


232
0:7:56,374 --> 0:7:58,165
Sensing the drop in
pressure, it constantly


233
0:7:58,165 --> 0:8:0,584
flooded itself with air from
my nitrogen tank to equalize.


234
0:8:0,584 --> 0:8:2,25
Once the leak became
manageable, it only


235
0:8:2,25 --> 0:8:5,4
had to trickle new air in
slowly to relieve the air lost.


236
0:8:5,4 --> 0:8:7,989
After a while, the CO2, carbon
dioxide, absorbers in the suit


237
0:8:7,989 --> 0:8:10,28
were expended That's really
the limiting factor to life


238
0:8:10,28 --> 0:8:12,53
support-- not the amount of
oxygen you bring with you,


239
0:8:12,53 --> 0:8:14,34
but the amount of
CO2 you can remove.


240
0:8:14,34 --> 0:8:16,62
In the Hab, I have the
oxygenator, a large piece


241
0:8:16,62 --> 0:8:20,284
of equipment that breaks apart
CO2 to give the oxygen back.


242
0:8:20,284 --> 0:8:21,95
But the space suits
have to be portable.


243
0:8:21,95 --> 0:8:23,79
So they use a simple
chemical absorption


244
0:8:23,79 --> 0:8:25,58
process with expendable filters.


245
0:8:25,58 --> 0:8:28,304
I'd been asleep long enough
that my filters were useless.


246
0:8:28,304 --> 0:8:30,72
The suit saw this problem and
moved into an emergency mode


247
0:8:30,72 --> 0:8:32,309
the engineers call
"bloodletting."


248
0:8:32,309 --> 0:8:33,929
Having no way to
separate the CO2,


249
0:8:33,929 --> 0:8:36,47
the suit deliberately vented
air into the Martian atmosphere,


250
0:8:36,47 --> 0:8:37,94
then back-filled with nitrogen.


251
0:8:37,94 --> 0:8:39,34
Between the breach
and the bloodletting,


252
0:8:39,34 --> 0:8:40,659
it quickly ran out of nitrogen.


253
0:8:40,659 --> 0:8:42,846
All it had left
was my oxygen tank.


254
0:8:42,846 --> 0:8:44,97
So it did the only thing
it could to keep me alive.


255
0:8:44,97 --> 0:8:46,678
It started back-filling
with pure oxygen.


256
0:8:46,678 --> 0:8:49,84
I now risked dying
from oxygen toxicity


257
0:8:49,84 --> 0:8:50,75
as the excessively
high amount of oxygen


258
0:8:50,75 --> 0:8:53,25
threatened to burn up my nervous
system, lungs, and eyes--


259
0:8:53,25 --> 0:8:55,791
an ironic death for someone with
a leaky space suit, too much


260
0:8:55,791 --> 0:8:56,571
oxygen.


261
0:8:56,571 --> 0:8:59,7
Every step of the way would
have had beeping alarms, alerts,


262
0:8:59,7 --> 0:8:59,63
and warnings.


263
0:8:59,63 --> 0:9:2,55
But it was a high oxygen
morning that woke me.


264
0:9:2,55 --> 0:9:4,68
The sheer volume of training for
a space mission is astounding.


265
0:9:4,68 --> 0:9:7,2
I'd spent a week back on Earth
practicing emergency spacesuit


266
0:9:7,2 --> 0:9:7,7
drills.


267
0:9:7,7 --> 0:9:8,622
I knew what to do.


268
0:9:8,622 --> 0:9:10,33
Carefully reaching
the side of my helmet,


269
0:9:10,33 --> 0:9:11,22
I got the breach kit.


270
0:9:11,22 --> 0:9:13,49
It's nothing more than a funnel
with a valve at the small end


271
0:9:13,49 --> 0:9:15,78
and an unbelievably sticky
resin on the white end.


272
0:9:15,78 --> 0:9:18,284
The idea is you have
the valve open and stick


273
0:9:18,284 --> 0:9:19,45
the white end over the hole.


274
0:9:19,45 --> 0:9:20,71
The air can escape
through the valve


275
0:9:20,71 --> 0:9:22,9
so it doesn't interfere with
the resin making a good seal.


276
0:9:22,9 --> 0:9:24,92
Then you close the valve,
and you've sealed the breach.


277
0:9:24,92 --> 0:9:26,99
The tricky part was getting
the antenna out of the way.


278
0:9:26,99 --> 0:9:28,29
I pulled it out as
fast as I could,


279
0:9:28,29 --> 0:9:30,581
wincing as the sudden pressure
drop dizzied me and made


280
0:9:30,581 --> 0:9:32,649
the wound in my side
scream in agony.


281
0:9:32,649 --> 0:9:34,69
I got the breach kit over
the hole and sealed it.


282
0:9:34,69 --> 0:9:35,32
It held.


283
0:9:35,32 --> 0:9:37,96
The suit back-filled the missing
air with yet more oxygen.


284
0:9:37,96 --> 0:9:41,1
Checking my arm readouts, I saw
the suit was now at 85% oxygen.


285
0:9:41,1 --> 0:9:43,69
For reference, Earth's
atmosphere is about 21%.


286
0:9:43,69 --> 0:9:46,69
I'd be OK so long as I didn't
spend too much time like that.


287
0:9:46,69 --> 0:9:48,47
I stumbled up the
hill back to the Hab.


288
0:9:48,47 --> 0:9:49,81
As I crested the
rise, I saw something


289
0:9:49,81 --> 0:9:51,351
that made me very
happy and something


290
0:9:51,351 --> 0:9:52,27
that made me very sad.


291
0:9:52,27 --> 0:9:53,31
The Hab was intact.


292
0:9:53,31 --> 0:9:53,9
Yay!


293
0:9:53,9 --> 0:9:55,5
And the MAV was gone.


294
0:9:55,5 --> 0:9:55,505
Boo!


295
0:9:55,505 --> 0:9:58,729



296
0:9:58,729 --> 0:10:0,52
Right at that moment,
I knew I was screwed.


297
0:10:0,52 --> 0:10:2,2
But I didn't want to just
die out on the surface.


298
0:10:2,2 --> 0:10:4,5
I limped back to the Hab
and fumbled my way out


299
0:10:4,5 --> 0:10:5,56
into an airlock.


300
0:10:5,56 --> 0:10:7,552
As soon as it equalized,
I threw off my helmet.


301
0:10:7,552 --> 0:10:9,135
Once inside the Hab,
I doffed the suit


302
0:10:9,135 --> 0:10:10,922
and got my first good
look at the injury.


303
0:10:10,922 --> 0:10:11,88
It would need stitches.


304
0:10:11,88 --> 0:10:13,504
Fortunately, all of
us had been trained


305
0:10:13,504 --> 0:10:16,0
in basic medical
procedures and the Hab


306
0:10:16,0 --> 0:10:17,819
had excellent medical supplies.


307
0:10:17,819 --> 0:10:20,11
A quick shot of a local
anesthetic, irrigate the wound,


308
0:10:20,11 --> 0:10:21,44
nine stitches, and I was done.


309
0:10:21,44 --> 0:10:23,44
I'd be taking antibiotics
for a couple of weeks,


310
0:10:23,44 --> 0:10:24,774
but other than that I'd be fine.


311
0:10:24,774 --> 0:10:26,523
I knew it was hopeless,
but I tried firing


312
0:10:26,523 --> 0:10:27,72
up the communications array.


313
0:10:27,72 --> 0:10:28,704
No signal, of course.


314
0:10:28,704 --> 0:10:30,87
The primary satellite dish
had broken off, remember?


315
0:10:30,87 --> 0:10:33,26
And it took the reception
antennae with it.


316
0:10:33,26 --> 0:10:35,66
The Hab had secondary and
tertiary communication systems,


317
0:10:35,66 --> 0:10:37,118
but they were both
just for talking


318
0:10:37,118 --> 0:10:39,63
to the MAV, which would use
it's much more powerful systems


319
0:10:39,63 --> 0:10:40,505
to relay to "Hermes."


320
0:10:40,505 --> 0:10:43,42
The thing is, that only works
if the MAV is still around.


321
0:10:43,42 --> 0:10:44,87
I had no way to
talk to "Hermes."


322
0:10:44,87 --> 0:10:46,61
In time, I could locate
the dish on the surface,


323
0:10:46,61 --> 0:10:48,42
but it would take weeks for
me to rig up any repairs


324
0:10:48,42 --> 0:10:49,544
and that would be too late.


325
0:10:49,544 --> 0:10:52,134
In an abort, "Hermes" would
leave within 24 hours.


326
0:10:52,134 --> 0:10:54,3
The orbital dynamics made
the trip safer and shorter


327
0:10:54,3 --> 0:10:55,26
the earlier you left.


328
0:10:55,26 --> 0:10:56,566
So why wait?


329
0:10:56,566 --> 0:10:58,19
Checking out my suit,
I saw the antenna


330
0:10:58,19 --> 0:10:59,91
had plowed through my
biomonitor computer.


331
0:10:59,91 --> 0:11:1,421
When on an EVA, all
the crew's suits


332
0:11:1,421 --> 0:11:3,42
are networked so we can
see each other's status.


333
0:11:3,42 --> 0:11:5,55
The rest of the crew would have
seen the pressure in my suit


334
0:11:5,55 --> 0:11:7,216
drop to nearly zero
followed immediately


335
0:11:7,216 --> 0:11:9,9
by my biosigns going flat.


336
0:11:9,9 --> 0:11:11,477
Add to that, watching me
tumble down a hill with a spear


337
0:11:11,477 --> 0:11:13,6
threw me in the
middle of a sandstorm?


338
0:11:13,6 --> 0:11:14,46
Yeah, they thought I was dead.


339
0:11:14,46 --> 0:11:16,192
How could they not?


340
0:11:16,192 --> 0:11:17,9
They may have even
had a brief discussion


341
0:11:17,9 --> 0:11:20,27
about recovering my body,
but regulations were clear.


342
0:11:20,27 --> 0:11:22,737
In the event a crewman dies
on Mars, he stays on Mars.


343
0:11:22,737 --> 0:11:25,32
Leaving his body behind reduces
weight for the MAV on the trip


344
0:11:25,32 --> 0:11:25,69
back.


345
0:11:25,69 --> 0:11:27,815
That means more disposable
fuel and a larger margin


346
0:11:27,815 --> 0:11:29,32
of error for the return thrust.


347
0:11:29,32 --> 0:11:31,64
No point in giving that
up for sentimentality.


348
0:11:31,64 --> 0:11:32,93
So that's the situation.


349
0:11:32,93 --> 0:11:33,84
I'm stranded on Mars.


350
0:11:33,84 --> 0:11:35,65
I have no way to communicate
with "Hermes" or Earth.


351
0:11:35,65 --> 0:11:36,84
Everyone thinks I'm dead.


352
0:11:36,84 --> 0:11:38,86
I'm in a Hab designed
to last 31 days.


353
0:11:38,86 --> 0:11:40,789
If the oxygenator breaks
down, I'll suffocate.


354
0:11:40,789 --> 0:11:43,8
If the water reclaimer breaks
down, I'll die of thirst.


355
0:11:43,8 --> 0:11:45,6
If the Hab breaches, I'll
just kind of explode.


356
0:11:45,6 --> 0:11:46,56
If none of those
things happen, I'll


357
0:11:46,56 --> 0:11:48,518
eventually run out of
food and starve to death.


358
0:11:48,518 --> 0:11:49,743
So yeah, I'm fucked.


359
0:11:49,743 --> 0:11:50,689
[LAUGHTER]


360
0:11:50,689 --> 0:11:56,37
[APPLAUSE]


361
0:11:56,37 --> 0:11:57,78
So that's chapter one.


362
0:11:57,78 --> 0:11:59,895



363
0:11:59,895 --> 0:12:1,77
Of the things that was
really important to me


364
0:12:1,77 --> 0:12:3,395
in writing this was
I wanted everything


365
0:12:3,395 --> 0:12:5,96
to be as scientifically
accurate as possible.


366
0:12:5,96 --> 0:12:7,51
So for starters,
all the technology


367
0:12:7,51 --> 0:12:10,69
mentioned in the book is real.


368
0:12:10,69 --> 0:12:12,36
It takes place in
a slight future,


369
0:12:12,36 --> 0:12:15,53
so some of the technology is
much more efficient or much


370
0:12:15,53 --> 0:12:18,2
more effective than the
versions of it we have now.


371
0:12:18,2 --> 0:12:20,97
But it all actually exists.


372
0:12:20,97 --> 0:12:22,6
And what I'm going
to talk to you today


373
0:12:22,6 --> 0:12:24,225
about-- being a Google
crowd, I thought


374
0:12:24,225 --> 0:12:26,225
you might be interested
in some software I wrote


375
0:12:26,225 --> 0:12:29,88
to make one part of it
as accurate as possible.


376
0:12:29,88 --> 0:12:32,89
It has to do with the way that
"Hermes" got from Earth to Mars


377
0:12:32,89 --> 0:12:34,2
and back.


378
0:12:34,2 --> 0:12:36,124
"Hermes" is an ion engine ship.


379
0:12:36,124 --> 0:12:38,54
And for those of you who don't
know what ion engines are--


380
0:12:38,54 --> 0:12:41,64
I mean, I described it
briefly in the chapter--


381
0:12:41,64 --> 0:12:43,864
but basically, instead
of a chemical propellant


382
0:12:43,864 --> 0:12:45,53
going out the back
of the ship providing


383
0:12:45,53 --> 0:12:48,34
a large amount of impulse,
it's a very small amount


384
0:12:48,34 --> 0:12:50,45
of acceleration caused
by magnetic fields


385
0:12:50,45 --> 0:12:52,37
throwing ions out
the back of the ship.


386
0:12:52,37 --> 0:12:54,6
Now the benefit to
this is that you


387
0:12:54,6 --> 0:12:57,19
can have much, much,
much less reactant mass.


388
0:12:57,19 --> 0:12:59,97
And I believe-- and this is
just my own subjective opinion--


389
0:12:59,97 --> 0:13:3,476
we have to improve on the
technology that we have


390
0:13:3,476 --> 0:13:4,6
and just keep working that.


391
0:13:4,6 --> 0:13:5,975
I think that's
the only way we'll


392
0:13:5,975 --> 0:13:9,92
be able to send humans long
distances out into space.


393
0:13:9,92 --> 0:13:12,52
The amount of
chemical propellant


394
0:13:12,52 --> 0:13:14,83
you would need to send
something big enough


395
0:13:14,83 --> 0:13:17,89
to support humans for
several months out to Mars


396
0:13:17,89 --> 0:13:19,78
would just be huge, huge.


397
0:13:19,78 --> 0:13:21,7
I mean, you'd be putting
millions and millions


398
0:13:21,7 --> 0:13:24,67
of kilograms of just fuel
into space to do this.


399
0:13:24,67 --> 0:13:27,69
So you need to
minimize how much you


400
0:13:27,69 --> 0:13:29,93
launch from Earth to
make that efficient.


401
0:13:29,93 --> 0:13:32,81
So that means for "Hermes,"
I decided, oh, OK,


402
0:13:32,81 --> 0:13:35,4
so it's got a slow constant
acceleration from ion engines.


403
0:13:35,4 --> 0:13:36,78
It's got a nuclear
reactor aboard


404
0:13:36,78 --> 0:13:39,47
to create the energy necessary
to throw the particles.


405
0:13:39,47 --> 0:13:44,99
And so that means I needed to
figure out how it gets there.


406
0:13:44,99 --> 0:13:47,5
And it turns out for a point
acceleration, when you just


407
0:13:47,5 --> 0:13:50,23
say, oh, I want to go on
a transfer orbit from here


408
0:13:50,23 --> 0:13:51,2
to here.


409
0:13:51,2 --> 0:13:52,73
And then there'll be
a point thrust here,


410
0:13:52,73 --> 0:13:54,32
and then another
point thrust here


411
0:13:54,32 --> 0:13:56,71
to match Mars, boom,
that's how we do it.


412
0:13:56,71 --> 0:13:57,69
It's very simple.


413
0:13:57,69 --> 0:13:59,85
Well, I mean, for
a dork like me who


414
0:13:59,85 --> 0:14:2,26
likes orbital dynamics,
that's very simple.


415
0:14:2,26 --> 0:14:5,52
With a constantly accelerating
ship, that's very hard.


416
0:14:5,52 --> 0:14:7,23
I could not wrap my
head around the math.


417
0:14:7,23 --> 0:14:8,59
I couldn't find
anybody who could


418
0:14:8,59 --> 0:14:9,964
wrap their heads
around the math.


419
0:14:9,964 --> 0:14:12,8
And what I found out by
doing further research


420
0:14:12,8 --> 0:14:14,9
is NASA does this by
computer simulation.


421
0:14:14,9 --> 0:14:15,9
So that's what I did.


422
0:14:15,9 --> 0:14:18,42



423
0:14:18,42 --> 0:14:21,452
I wrote this program
called Orbits.


424
0:14:21,452 --> 0:14:22,91
I don't how well
that's showing up.


425
0:14:22,91 --> 0:14:23,701
Let me take a look.


426
0:14:23,701 --> 0:14:24,95
Are you able to see?


427
0:14:24,95 --> 0:14:26,1
Yeah, you can kind of see.


428
0:14:26,1 --> 0:14:27,77
It's a little darker
than I'd like.


429
0:14:27,77 --> 0:14:33,7
But this-- well, I've got
a mouse-- this circle here,


430
0:14:33,7 --> 0:14:35,18
this red circle, is Mars' orbit.


431
0:14:35,18 --> 0:14:37,24
The blue circle
is Earth's orbit.


432
0:14:37,24 --> 0:14:40,27
And the gray line is
the course of the ship.


433
0:14:40,27 --> 0:14:44,94
So the way this works is I can
mess around with the vector


434
0:14:44,94 --> 0:14:48,94
that the ship is presenting
with respect to the sun.


435
0:14:48,94 --> 0:14:51,29
So in other words, if I were
to point it directly away


436
0:14:51,29 --> 0:14:55,6
from the sun, then I can
show where that vector's


437
0:14:55,6 --> 0:14:56,747
going to be anywhere
along the trip.


438
0:14:56,747 --> 0:14:58,83
You see how it's always
pointed away from the sun?


439
0:14:58,83 --> 0:15:1,64
The red vector that's
following the mouse?


440
0:15:1,64 --> 0:15:2,98
That's how this works.


441
0:15:2,98 --> 0:15:5,26
And so I can do
something like this.


442
0:15:5,26 --> 0:15:7,28
I can point it-- well,
directly toward the sun


443
0:15:7,28 --> 0:15:8,53
leads to your immediate death.


444
0:15:8,53 --> 0:15:11,52
But point it, say,
perpendicular to the sun,


445
0:15:11,52 --> 0:15:12,51
you can see it's
just always trying


446
0:15:12,51 --> 0:15:14,21
to go perpendicular to the sun.


447
0:15:14,21 --> 0:15:16,14
So what I wanted
to do here is, say,


448
0:15:16,14 --> 0:15:17,75
this is the start
point of Earth.


449
0:15:17,75 --> 0:15:19,794
And as you see, if
I move along, it


450
0:15:19,794 --> 0:15:21,21
shows me where
Earth and Mars will


451
0:15:21,21 --> 0:15:24,15
be as they're going
along in their orbits


452
0:15:24,15 --> 0:15:28,17
from my chosen launch window.


453
0:15:28,17 --> 0:15:31,18
And then the idea is
to try to find a way


454
0:15:31,18 --> 0:15:38,94
to make this get to Mars
with course changes and stuff


455
0:15:38,94 --> 0:15:41,69
and work that out.


456
0:15:41,69 --> 0:15:45,21
This would not be
a successful trip.


457
0:15:45,21 --> 0:15:48,23
But after all a whole bunch of
work and just fiddling around


458
0:15:48,23 --> 0:15:52,93
with it, I managed to figure out
this path that actually starts


459
0:15:52,93 --> 0:15:56,38
here, then intercepts
Mars, and then


460
0:15:56,38 --> 0:15:58,63
doesn't do any thrusting
or anything for a while.


461
0:15:58,63 --> 0:16:0,29
It's just at Mars.


462
0:16:0,29 --> 0:16:2,46
And then comes back to Earth.


463
0:16:2,46 --> 0:16:4,98
I also set up this
app to animate.


464
0:16:4,98 --> 0:16:8,86
So I can just press Space,
and you can watch it happen.


465
0:16:8,86 --> 0:16:10,77
There it goes to
Mars, hangs out there


466
0:16:10,77 --> 0:16:13,42
for their planned
31-day mission,


467
0:16:13,42 --> 0:16:17,4
and then comes back
to Earth like that.


468
0:16:17,4 --> 0:16:18,9
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] a year.


469
0:16:18,9 --> 0:16:21,31
ANDY WEIR: It takes a
little bit more than a year.


470
0:16:21,31 --> 0:16:23,351
I don't know if you can
read it up in the corner.


471
0:16:23,351 --> 0:16:27,68
Mission day 396 is
when it completes.


472
0:16:27,68 --> 0:16:30,23
Now, then, as I
mentioned in the book,


473
0:16:30,23 --> 0:16:35,39
they had to abort after only six
days on Mars due to the storm.


474
0:16:35,39 --> 0:16:37,51
And I mentioned,
the orbital dynamics


475
0:16:37,51 --> 0:16:39,68
make it cheaper the
earlier you leave.


476
0:16:39,68 --> 0:16:40,56
And this is why.


477
0:16:40,56 --> 0:16:43,44
Because if you
leave earlier, you


478
0:16:43,44 --> 0:16:45,14
can take a slightly
different course


479
0:16:45,14 --> 0:16:47,8
and get back to Earth earlier.


480
0:16:47,8 --> 0:16:49,18
And that's, of course,
what anybody would want.


481
0:16:49,18 --> 0:16:52,94
Any NASA mission
designer worth their salt


482
0:16:52,94 --> 0:16:54,92
would want to do
something like this.


483
0:16:54,92 --> 0:16:58,91
Another thing I did
was-- it came up


484
0:16:58,91 --> 0:17:1,72
a lot in the story-- I
wanted the transmission


485
0:17:1,72 --> 0:17:2,82
times to be accurate.


486
0:17:2,82 --> 0:17:5,97
So when later on in the story
they're talking to the ship,


487
0:17:5,97 --> 0:17:9,42
they're talking to Mars,
Mars is talking to Earth,


488
0:17:9,42 --> 0:17:11,1
all these entities
are communicating,


489
0:17:11,1 --> 0:17:13,839
and I wanted to know what the
transmission time would be.


490
0:17:13,839 --> 0:17:16,849
So I set it up so that
wherever the ship is--


491
0:17:16,849 --> 0:17:20,4
I can just move the
mouse around and wherever


492
0:17:20,4 --> 0:17:23,3
I'm pointing on that-- it'll
tell you what mission day it is


493
0:17:23,3 --> 0:17:24,869
and what the current
distances are


494
0:17:24,869 --> 0:17:26,663
between Earth and Mars,
Earth and "Hermes,"


495
0:17:26,663 --> 0:17:27,579
and "Hermes" and Mars.


496
0:17:27,579 --> 0:17:30,89
Those are those three numbers up
top, and the light transmission


497
0:17:30,89 --> 0:17:32,85
time between them
so that I could


498
0:17:32,85 --> 0:17:36,9
have that be accurate
in the story, too.


499
0:17:36,9 --> 0:17:38,79
So I'm going to give a
little bit of a spoiler here.


500
0:17:38,79 --> 0:17:42,64
The final path that "Hermes"
ends up taking is this.


501
0:17:42,64 --> 0:17:45,93



502
0:17:45,93 --> 0:17:46,75
And so--


503
0:17:46,75 --> 0:17:48,333
AUDIENCE: It looks
like the other one.


504
0:17:48,333 --> 0:17:50,546



505
0:17:50,546 --> 0:17:52,42
ANDY WEIR: So I am giving
a bit of a spoiler,


506
0:17:52,42 --> 0:17:54,92
but basically they have
to go back to Mars.


507
0:17:54,92 --> 0:17:59,42
And so I'll describe what
happens as it's happening.


508
0:17:59,42 --> 0:18:0,12
Here they go.


509
0:18:0,12 --> 0:18:1,3
They're going to Mars.


510
0:18:1,3 --> 0:18:3,48
After six Sols,
they have to abort.


511
0:18:3,48 --> 0:18:6,22
So they're headed back to Earth.


512
0:18:6,22 --> 0:18:7,49
They need to go back to Mars.


513
0:18:7,49 --> 0:18:10,91
Boom, sling shot off of
Earth, back around the sun.


514
0:18:10,91 --> 0:18:13,124
And now they need to
do a flyby of Mars.


515
0:18:13,124 --> 0:18:14,79
So they're not going
into orbit, they're


516
0:18:14,79 --> 0:18:16,71
just-- doink-- doing a flyby.


517
0:18:16,71 --> 0:18:19,65
And then we got to
get back to Earth.


518
0:18:19,65 --> 0:18:24,29



519
0:18:24,29 --> 0:18:29,45
So that was a lot of
work to figure that out.


520
0:18:29,45 --> 0:18:31,62
And this is all done
within this simulation,


521
0:18:31,62 --> 0:18:34,79
this ship "Hermes," has a
total constant acceleration


522
0:18:34,79 --> 0:18:37,34
of the two millimeters
per second per second.


523
0:18:37,34 --> 0:18:38,1
That's it.


524
0:18:38,1 --> 0:18:39,68
That's all it gets.


525
0:18:39,68 --> 0:18:42,85
So yeah, after five
seconds of doing that,


526
0:18:42,85 --> 0:18:46,96
it would be moving one
centimeter per second.


527
0:18:46,96 --> 0:18:50,56
So that's the software I wrote
that I wanted to show off.


528
0:18:50,56 --> 0:18:56,611
I thought the Google crowd would
like to see how that works.


529
0:18:56,611 --> 0:18:57,86
And that's about it, actually.


530
0:18:57,86 --> 0:19:0,8
That's all I really
had to show you.


531
0:19:0,8 --> 0:19:1,41
I was going to do the reading.


532
0:19:1,41 --> 0:19:2,8
What are we at here?


533
0:19:2,8 --> 0:19:3,985
Oh, 20 minutes in.


534
0:19:3,985 --> 0:19:6,692



535
0:19:6,692 --> 0:19:7,9
AUDIENCE: I really like that.


536
0:19:7,9 --> 0:19:9,63
So that's great.


537
0:19:9,63 --> 0:19:13,55
And it seems beyond
what you had to do.


538
0:19:13,55 --> 0:19:16,13
Are the orbits elliptical?


539
0:19:16,13 --> 0:19:18,23
And could they be skewed?


540
0:19:18,23 --> 0:19:20,71
ANDY WEIR: Those are the
actual orbits of Earth and Mars


541
0:19:20,71 --> 0:19:22,9
correctly oriented.


542
0:19:22,9 --> 0:19:23,756
And the launch window--
I won't tell you


543
0:19:23,756 --> 0:19:26,51
the date because I may have a
contest someday to have people


544
0:19:26,51 --> 0:19:30,43
figure out the launch date from
the information in the book--


545
0:19:30,43 --> 0:19:32,94
but it is based on
a real-world date.


546
0:19:32,94 --> 0:19:38,12
And to be thorough,
the book tells you


547
0:19:38,12 --> 0:19:39,57
what day everything is on.


548
0:19:39,57 --> 0:19:41,56
So it's like, log entry, Sol 6.


549
0:19:41,56 --> 0:19:43,25
Log entry, Sol 27.


550
0:19:43,25 --> 0:19:44,76
Log entry, Sol 412.


551
0:19:44,76 --> 0:19:45,77
Whatever.


552
0:19:45,77 --> 0:19:48,36
So it's actually very
time specific, just


553
0:19:48,36 --> 0:19:50,21
the narrative style it has.


554
0:19:50,21 --> 0:19:53,59
And so I made sure that I knew
the actual real-world date


555
0:19:53,59 --> 0:19:56,6
for each-- on any given
day in the book, what


556
0:19:56,6 --> 0:19:59,79
the real-world date is so that
I could mention things like, oh,


557
0:19:59,79 --> 0:20:1,4
by the way, today's Christmas.


558
0:20:1,4 --> 0:20:2,94
And it is.


559
0:20:2,94 --> 0:20:5,25
There were sometimes
I had to keep myself


560
0:20:5,25 --> 0:20:7,4
from over clever-ing things.


561
0:20:7,4 --> 0:20:9,44
There was one kind of major
plot point that happened.


562
0:20:9,44 --> 0:20:11,37
And I'm looking
at my spreadsheet.


563
0:20:11,37 --> 0:20:13,92
And I'm like, oh, this happens
to be on Valentine's Day.


564
0:20:13,92 --> 0:20:14,96
I should mention that.


565
0:20:14,96 --> 0:20:16,93
But it would just seem
stupid to the reader.


566
0:20:16,93 --> 0:20:18,59
It would be like out of nowhere
someone's like, by the way,


567
0:20:18,59 --> 0:20:20,2
it's Valentine's Day.


568
0:20:20,2 --> 0:20:22,95
It's like, no, that's just dumb.


569
0:20:22,95 --> 0:20:25,84
The trickiest part in this
was I did all sorts of math.


570
0:20:25,84 --> 0:20:28,57
I checked all my physics,
math, science, everything.


571
0:20:28,57 --> 0:20:32,257
And the hard part was not
bragging to the reader.


572
0:20:32,257 --> 0:20:34,59
It was not showing my work
and trying to go, look at me.


573
0:20:34,59 --> 0:20:35,445
I'm so cool.


574
0:20:35,445 --> 0:20:37,32
I just needed to keep
the story moving along.


575
0:20:37,32 --> 0:20:38,611
And I wanted it to be accurate.


576
0:20:38,611 --> 0:20:39,12
That's all.


577
0:20:39,12 --> 0:20:41,87
AUDIENCE: So I read the
book about a year ago.


578
0:20:41,87 --> 0:20:43,789
What I enjoyed the
most about it were


579
0:20:43,789 --> 0:20:45,8
two things about the character.


580
0:20:45,8 --> 0:20:47,23
One was how resourceful he is.


581
0:20:47,23 --> 0:20:50,79
He always figures out how
to get out of his situation.


582
0:20:50,79 --> 0:20:52,62
The other was his attitude.


583
0:20:52,62 --> 0:20:53,7
He's cut off.


584
0:20:53,7 --> 0:20:54,7
He has so many setbacks.


585
0:20:54,7 --> 0:20:56,33
And he always keeps his head up.


586
0:20:56,33 --> 0:20:57,6
I was wondering,
was there anything


587
0:20:57,6 --> 0:20:59,75
that inspired you to make
a character like that?


588
0:20:59,75 --> 0:21:1,374
Or was there any kind
of message you're


589
0:21:1,374 --> 0:21:3,71
trying to send to make
somebody so resourceful and so


590
0:21:3,71 --> 0:21:6,71
optimistic in such
a bad situation?


591
0:21:6,71 --> 0:21:9,44
ANDY WEIR: Well, I
mean, I tried to make


592
0:21:9,44 --> 0:21:10,61
it a pretty upbeat book.


593
0:21:10,61 --> 0:21:12,806
It could've been really
dark and depressing, right?


594
0:21:12,806 --> 0:21:14,18
It's like the guys
trapped alone.


595
0:21:14,18 --> 0:21:16,84
He could be just having
this crippling psychological


596
0:21:16,84 --> 0:21:19,56
problems of loneliness
and all these other things


597
0:21:19,56 --> 0:21:20,93
that most people would face.


598
0:21:20,93 --> 0:21:23,5
I figure I can buy
my way out of that


599
0:21:23,5 --> 0:21:24,51
by saying he's an astronaut.


600
0:21:24,51 --> 0:21:26,19
Astronauts are a cut above.


601
0:21:26,19 --> 0:21:28,35
And so he doesn't
sink into depression.


602
0:21:28,35 --> 0:21:30,32
He just goes into
problem-solving mode.


603
0:21:30,32 --> 0:21:33,79
And I made him this really
flippant, smart-ass personality


604
0:21:33,79 --> 0:21:36,14
because I had to
tell a whole story.


605
0:21:36,14 --> 0:21:40,43
If I'd done just
blank narration, just


606
0:21:40,43 --> 0:21:43,55
omniscient narration even,
it would have just seemed


607
0:21:43,55 --> 0:21:47,19
like a technical manual or a
really dry sequence of events.


608
0:21:47,19 --> 0:21:49,55
I needed something in
the narration itself


609
0:21:49,55 --> 0:21:51,6
that would keep the
user interested.


610
0:21:51,6 --> 0:21:54,655
And so having it told by a
self-effacing smart-ass seemed


611
0:21:54,655 --> 0:21:55,679
liked a good idea.


612
0:21:55,679 --> 0:21:57,72
AUDIENCE: So I'm thinking
about buying this book.


613
0:21:57,72 --> 0:21:59,11
ANDY WEIR: $10 right over there.


614
0:21:59,11 --> 0:22:0,29
AUDIENCE: How do you
think I should buy it?


615
0:22:0,29 --> 0:22:0,956
ANDY WEIR: I think you should
buy one for all your friends.


616
0:22:0,956 --> 0:22:2,53
AUDIENCE: It's $10
right over there,


617
0:22:2,53 --> 0:22:5,9
but there's also a lot
of digital distribution


618
0:22:5,9 --> 0:22:6,7
around these days.


619
0:22:6,7 --> 0:22:9,1
Do you have thoughts as
an author about that?


620
0:22:9,1 --> 0:22:10,42
And what works best for you?


621
0:22:10,42 --> 0:22:12,25
What do you like as a reader?


622
0:22:12,25 --> 0:22:15,307
And what do you think about
ebooks in general as an author?


623
0:22:15,307 --> 0:22:17,64
ANDY WEIR: Well, ebooks are
how I got into the industry,


624
0:22:17,64 --> 0:22:19,59
so I'm extremely grateful.


625
0:22:19,59 --> 0:22:21,8
I think they're great.


626
0:22:21,8 --> 0:22:24,9
And as for buying a
physical book or an ebook,


627
0:22:24,9 --> 0:22:26,78
that's a matter of
personal choice.


628
0:22:26,78 --> 0:22:28,93
I still read physical
books, but that's


629
0:22:28,93 --> 0:22:30,62
just because I'm
kind of a Luddite.


630
0:22:30,62 --> 0:22:33,47
Eventually, I will
get a proper e-reader.


631
0:22:33,47 --> 0:22:36,8
And then I'll probably be
hooked on that from then on.


632
0:22:36,8 --> 0:22:38,654



633
0:22:38,654 --> 0:22:40,57
For those of you who
don't know, "The Martian"


634
0:22:40,57 --> 0:22:42,24
was originally
just a serial story


635
0:22:42,24 --> 0:22:44,8
that I was posting
to my website just


636
0:22:44,8 --> 0:22:46,83
as a hobby doing
in my spare time.


637
0:22:46,83 --> 0:22:49,43
And then I finished
and some people


638
0:22:49,43 --> 0:22:51,97
said, hey, I don't like
reading this on web pages.


639
0:22:51,97 --> 0:22:54,387
Can you put it up
in an ebook format?


640
0:22:54,387 --> 0:22:55,22
And so I'm like, OK.


641
0:22:55,22 --> 0:22:56,759
So I made an EPUB
and MOBI version.


642
0:22:56,759 --> 0:22:58,8
And I posted them on the
website and said, there.


643
0:22:58,8 --> 0:22:59,0
There you go.


644
0:22:59,0 --> 0:23:0,64
Free download,
knock yourself out.


645
0:23:0,64 --> 0:23:2,88
And then some people
were like, well,


646
0:23:2,88 --> 0:23:4,48
I'm not really
technically savvy.


647
0:23:4,48 --> 0:23:7,3
And I don't know how to
get an ebook downloaded


648
0:23:7,3 --> 0:23:9,28
from the internet
onto my Kindle.


649
0:23:9,28 --> 0:23:12,38
Is there a way you can
just put it up on Kindle?


650
0:23:12,38 --> 0:23:13,76
And so I looked into it.


651
0:23:13,76 --> 0:23:16,824
And anybody can post
their stuff onto Kindle.


652
0:23:16,824 --> 0:23:18,99
Which is important-- remember
that-- because anybody


653
0:23:18,99 --> 0:23:20,72
who wants to be a
writer, you just can.


654
0:23:20,72 --> 0:23:24,36
You can just write your
story, post it on Kindle.


655
0:23:24,36 --> 0:23:25,41
All they do is
they check to make


656
0:23:25,41 --> 0:23:28,87
sure there's nothing illegal or
really, really evil about what


657
0:23:28,87 --> 0:23:30,18
you're posting.


658
0:23:30,18 --> 0:23:34,1
And so I posted it up on Kindle.


659
0:23:34,1 --> 0:23:36,72
But Amazon is not a charity.


660
0:23:36,72 --> 0:23:37,97
They're in this to make money.


661
0:23:37,97 --> 0:23:39,52
They have a minimum
price that you're


662
0:23:39,52 --> 0:23:41,78
allowed to charge,
which is $0.99,


663
0:23:41,78 --> 0:23:43,49
or at least it was at the time.


664
0:23:43,49 --> 0:23:46,8
And so I said, OK, I'll
set the price at $0.99.


665
0:23:46,8 --> 0:23:47,867
I'm not allowed to charge less.


666
0:23:47,867 --> 0:23:49,45
And I told everybody,
hey, here it is.


667
0:23:49,45 --> 0:23:51,59
It's $0.99 because I can't
charge less than that.


668
0:23:51,59 --> 0:23:52,47
Just look at it this way.


669
0:23:52,47 --> 0:23:54,344
If you want to pay $1
to have it conveniently


670
0:23:54,344 --> 0:23:57,72
delivered to your Kindle,
that's what you're paying for.


671
0:23:57,72 --> 0:24:1,69
I got $0.30 or something
out of that per copy.


672
0:24:1,69 --> 0:24:3,94
I mean, I was not doing
this for the money.


673
0:24:3,94 --> 0:24:7,1
And then that's when
I learned how deep


674
0:24:7,1 --> 0:24:11,55
Amazon's reach into the
readership market is.


675
0:24:11,55 --> 0:24:15,44
Many, many, many more people--
many multiples more people--


676
0:24:15,44 --> 0:24:18,56
bought it from Amazon than
downloaded it for free


677
0:24:18,56 --> 0:24:19,12
from my site.


678
0:24:19,12 --> 0:24:21,954



679
0:24:21,954 --> 0:24:22,87
AUDIENCE: Such a deal.


680
0:24:22,87 --> 0:24:23,828
ANDY WEIR: Such a deal.


681
0:24:23,828 --> 0:24:25,69
I'm like, OK.


682
0:24:25,69 --> 0:24:28,42
And that caused
it to start making


683
0:24:28,42 --> 0:24:30,96
its way up the top
sellers charts.


684
0:24:30,96 --> 0:24:33,12
And then once it got into
the top 10 on sci-fi,


685
0:24:33,12 --> 0:24:34,411
then it started to really sell.


686
0:24:34,411 --> 0:24:36,84
Because of course, people
are like, I want a sci-fi.


687
0:24:36,84 --> 0:24:38,8
What's in the top 10?


688
0:24:38,8 --> 0:24:40,61
So once you break
into that list,


689
0:24:40,61 --> 0:24:43,312
your sales go really well.


690
0:24:43,312 --> 0:24:44,77
And it sold well
enough that it got


691
0:24:44,77 --> 0:24:48,6
the attention of a guy
named Julian Pavia at Random


692
0:24:48,6 --> 0:24:50,31
House, who was an editor there.


693
0:24:50,31 --> 0:24:51,919
And he said, I like this book.


694
0:24:51,919 --> 0:24:54,46
I think I want to talk to this
reader and offer a print deal.


695
0:24:54,46 --> 0:24:56,668
But first I'm going to run
it by a colleague of mine,


696
0:24:56,668 --> 0:24:58,919
a guy named David Fugate,
who is a literary agent.


697
0:24:58,919 --> 0:25:0,71
He said, hey, why don't
you read this book,


698
0:25:0,71 --> 0:25:1,92
tell me what you
think, and do you


699
0:25:1,92 --> 0:25:3,711
think I should offer
this guy a print deal?


700
0:25:3,711 --> 0:25:6,48
David read it and said,
I think it's good.


701
0:25:6,48 --> 0:25:8,23
I think you should
offer him a print deal.


702
0:25:8,23 --> 0:25:9,1
Now hang on a second.


703
0:25:9,1 --> 0:25:10,385
I'm going to go
become his agent.


704
0:25:10,385 --> 0:25:13,18



705
0:25:13,18 --> 0:25:14,2
So he did.


706
0:25:14,2 --> 0:25:15,46
And then he turned
around and said,


707
0:25:15,46 --> 0:25:18,35
so Julian, let's talk money.


708
0:25:18,35 --> 0:25:20,3
So that was pretty cool.


709
0:25:20,3 --> 0:25:23,39
So my whole experience
with publishing


710
0:25:23,39 --> 0:25:26,43
has been completely backwards.


711
0:25:26,43 --> 0:25:30,36
I wrote what I intended
to be just a free thing


712
0:25:30,36 --> 0:25:32,2
and then got forced
to charge for it.


713
0:25:32,2 --> 0:25:33,87
And then an agent came
knocking at my door.


714
0:25:33,87 --> 0:25:36,51
And then a publisher came
offering me a contract.


715
0:25:36,51 --> 0:25:38,85
And I did nothing to
promote it ever, by the way.


716
0:25:38,85 --> 0:25:40,7
All I ever did was just post it.


717
0:25:40,7 --> 0:25:43,35
I didn't even try
to go to forums


718
0:25:43,35 --> 0:25:45,78
or do events or anything
to get people to read it.


719
0:25:45,78 --> 0:25:47,82
It just spread by word of mouth.


720
0:25:47,82 --> 0:25:52,11
So the long-ass winded
answer to your question


721
0:25:52,11 --> 0:25:58,69
is I'm a big fan of digital
books because that made me.


722
0:25:58,69 --> 0:26:1,78
Sorry, one last addendum--
and it can make anyone.


723
0:26:1,78 --> 0:26:3,48
That's what I think
is awesome, is


724
0:26:3,48 --> 0:26:5,45
it's become a pure meritocracy.


725
0:26:5,45 --> 0:26:7,46
It used to be sort of
an old-boy network.


726
0:26:7,46 --> 0:26:10,7
You had to know somebody to get
into the publishing industry


727
0:26:10,7 --> 0:26:11,2
at all.


728
0:26:11,2 --> 0:26:14,77
Or you had to dedicate your
life to doing scutt work


729
0:26:14,77 --> 0:26:16,52
and working your way
up through journalism


730
0:26:16,52 --> 0:26:18,395
until someone would take
you seriously enough


731
0:26:18,395 --> 0:26:21,43
even to consider reading your
book at a publishing house.


732
0:26:21,43 --> 0:26:23,89
But now you can post it yourself
with no intervening steps


733
0:26:23,89 --> 0:26:26,97
and, if it's good,
people will buy it.


734
0:26:26,97 --> 0:26:32,33
AUDIENCE: So your ion drive,
is the reaction mass just small


735
0:26:32,33 --> 0:26:35,89
enough so that you don't
account for the change


736
0:26:35,89 --> 0:26:37,68
in how much acceleration
it can give?


737
0:26:37,68 --> 0:26:38,94
ANDY WEIR: I cheated.


738
0:26:38,94 --> 0:26:41,265
The answer is it
wouldn't quite be.


739
0:26:41,265 --> 0:26:42,14
It wouldn't quite be.


740
0:26:42,14 --> 0:26:44,56
And the simulation could
have accounted for it


741
0:26:44,56 --> 0:26:46,19
since it's doing
incremental-- every step,


742
0:26:46,19 --> 0:26:48,85
I think I had it do it
in one-hour segments


743
0:26:48,85 --> 0:26:50,9
to run the simulation forward.


744
0:26:50,9 --> 0:26:52,9
And so I could have
accounted for the mass loss.


745
0:26:52,9 --> 0:26:54,12
It is very small.


746
0:26:54,12 --> 0:26:57,62
It's on the order of-- I
can't remember exactly-- it


747
0:26:57,62 --> 0:27:0,51
was on the order of 10% of
the ship's mass, though.


748
0:27:0,51 --> 0:27:3,19
Normally if you
were going to do--


749
0:27:3,19 --> 0:27:5,885
to get to Mars using
a Hohmann transfer,


750
0:27:5,885 --> 0:27:9,24
it would take five
kilometers per second delta


751
0:27:9,24 --> 0:27:12,52
V, which would be
for a ship like this


752
0:27:12,52 --> 0:27:15,27
that I later defined as
being 110,000 kilograms,


753
0:27:15,27 --> 0:27:17,61
would be millions and
millions of kilograms of fuel.


754
0:27:17,61 --> 0:27:21,1
I mean, the vast majority of
the starting mass would be fuel.


755
0:27:21,1 --> 0:27:24,18
And so once I checked
the specific impulse


756
0:27:24,18 --> 0:27:26,2
of ion engines,
it's so much better


757
0:27:26,2 --> 0:27:29,58
than I just said, eh,
I'll approximate it out.


758
0:27:29,58 --> 0:27:31,58
AUDIENCE: In talking about
how to read the book,


759
0:27:31,58 --> 0:27:33,705
I wanted to put in a plug
for the audio book, which


760
0:27:33,705 --> 0:27:35,44
I listened to.


761
0:27:35,44 --> 0:27:36,46
It's a great way
to experience it.


762
0:27:36,46 --> 0:27:38,86
I think you got a really
wonderful narrator.


763
0:27:38,86 --> 0:27:41,17
ANDY WEIR: Yeah, the
narrator's name is RC Bray.


764
0:27:41,17 --> 0:27:42,59
And he's a veteran narrator.


765
0:27:42,59 --> 0:27:46,12
He's done over 100
books, I think.


766
0:27:46,12 --> 0:27:47,78
And he's got a
really good voice.


767
0:27:47,78 --> 0:27:50,182
And he puts a lot
of feeling into it.


768
0:27:50,182 --> 0:27:51,64
And since this is
first-person, you


769
0:27:51,64 --> 0:27:54,66
can kind of feel, OK, this
is Mark's voice, basically.


770
0:27:54,66 --> 0:27:57,82
AUDIENCE: The one thing I wanted
to ask about that was there


771
0:27:57,82 --> 0:28:0,105
are a couple of technical
terms that he, let's say,


772
0:28:0,105 --> 0:28:1,18
mispronounces that--


773
0:28:1,18 --> 0:28:2,14
ANDY WEIR: Yep, yep.


774
0:28:2,14 --> 0:28:3,8
AUDIENCE: --kind of take you
out of the story for a moment.


775
0:28:3,8 --> 0:28:3,97
ANDY WEIR: What?


776
0:28:3,97 --> 0:28:5,82
You don't know about
the ASC2 standard?


777
0:28:5,82 --> 0:28:7,903
AUDIENCE: Yeah, the ASC2
standard is the best one.


778
0:28:7,903 --> 0:28:9,885
ANDY WEIR: ASC2.


779
0:28:9,885 --> 0:28:12,88
Yep.


780
0:28:12,88 --> 0:28:14,56
AUDIENCE: But you get past that.


781
0:28:14,56 --> 0:28:16,643
ANDY WEIR: Well, so what
I wanted to do, actually,


782
0:28:16,643 --> 0:28:21,28
was make my own mapping
standard for letters to numbers.


783
0:28:21,28 --> 0:28:23,42
And I was going to call it ASC.


784
0:28:23,42 --> 0:28:26,71
And then I'd make an improved
version and call it ASC2.


785
0:28:26,71 --> 0:28:28,91
And that way I'd
retroactively be correct.


786
0:28:28,91 --> 0:28:31,789
No, yeah, he messed that up.


787
0:28:31,789 --> 0:28:33,33
Which is funny
because they called me


788
0:28:33,33 --> 0:28:36,41
for a bunch of pronunciations
on, OK, what is this?


789
0:28:36,41 --> 0:28:37,41
And how's it pronounced?


790
0:28:37,41 --> 0:28:38,77
How do people say this?


791
0:28:38,77 --> 0:28:43,64
But nobody ever asked me
how to pronounce ASCII.


792
0:28:43,64 --> 0:28:45,47
They are making a
new version of it,


793
0:28:45,47 --> 0:28:47,71
which I'm not sure
if it's out yet.


794
0:28:47,71 --> 0:28:49,4
But they're re-recording
it from scratch


795
0:28:49,4 --> 0:28:51,85
because there were a
lot of edits and changes


796
0:28:51,85 --> 0:28:53,66
between the original
Kindle version


797
0:28:53,66 --> 0:28:55,8
and what's releasing now.


798
0:28:55,8 --> 0:28:58,53
No significant plot
changes, nothing like that,


799
0:28:58,53 --> 0:29:0,12
but a lot of the wording.


800
0:29:0,12 --> 0:29:1,15
It's much more polished.


801
0:29:1,15 --> 0:29:6,57
And it's much better now thanks
to Julian at Random House.


802
0:29:6,57 --> 0:29:11,15
And so the audio book guys,
Podium Publishing, decided,


803
0:29:11,15 --> 0:29:12,98
well, we'll re-record
it from scratch.


804
0:29:12,98 --> 0:29:17,33
And I told them, A-S-C-I-I-
is pronounced AS-key.


805
0:29:17,33 --> 0:29:21,97
So I think they'll get it
right in the newer version.


806
0:29:21,97 --> 0:29:23,18
AUDIENCE: So I listened
to the audio version, too.


807
0:29:23,18 --> 0:29:25,11
I really liked it.


808
0:29:25,11 --> 0:29:31,33
So there was a lot in the
book about NASA politics


809
0:29:31,33 --> 0:29:35,61
and what happened inside NASA.


810
0:29:35,61 --> 0:29:37,6
Did you just dream that up?


811
0:29:37,6 --> 0:29:38,796
Or did you know
somebody on the inside?


812
0:29:38,796 --> 0:29:39,67
Or how did that work?


813
0:29:39,67 --> 0:29:42,639
ANDY WEIR: Made it all up.


814
0:29:42,639 --> 0:29:43,93
AUDIENCE: It sounded very real.


815
0:29:43,93 --> 0:29:44,93
ANDY WEIR: I thought so.


816
0:29:44,93 --> 0:29:48,16
Well, I've worked for
the government before.


817
0:29:48,16 --> 0:29:50,96
As he mentioned, my first
job was Sandia National Labs


818
0:29:50,96 --> 0:29:56,43
as a little weaselly computer
programmer at age 15,


819
0:29:56,43 --> 0:29:58,56
as opposed to the
41-year-old weaselly computer


820
0:29:58,56 --> 0:29:59,96
programmer I am now.


821
0:29:59,96 --> 0:30:4,27
And I just saw how
things worked there.


822
0:30:4,27 --> 0:30:7,4
And I said, like, well,
NASA's a big federal agency.


823
0:30:7,4 --> 0:30:8,29
So was Sandia.


824
0:30:8,29 --> 0:30:12,58
So I'll just assume that
they're kind of similar.


825
0:30:12,58 --> 0:30:14,785
But, yeah, I made all that up.


826
0:30:14,785 --> 0:30:17,57



827
0:30:17,57 --> 0:30:21,81
I had no contact with NASA
or astronauts or anyone


828
0:30:21,81 --> 0:30:23,81
in the industry at all
before writing the book.


829
0:30:23,81 --> 0:30:25,81
And I've since gotten a
lot of emails from them.


830
0:30:25,81 --> 0:30:27,351
And they say that
that's about right.


831
0:30:27,351 --> 0:30:31,779



832
0:30:31,779 --> 0:30:33,32
AUDIENCE: Not really
a question, I'll


833
0:30:33,32 --> 0:30:35,81
just note that
besides Amazon Kindle,


834
0:30:35,81 --> 0:30:39,475
it's also available
at Google Play Books.


835
0:30:39,475 --> 0:30:40,41
ANDY WEIR: All right.


836
0:30:40,41 --> 0:30:41,124
There you go.


837
0:30:41,124 --> 0:30:42,4
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].


838
0:30:42,4 --> 0:30:44,248
ANDY WEIR: It's also available
on barnesandnoble.com.


839
0:30:44,248 --> 0:30:46,83



840
0:30:46,83 --> 0:30:49,17
MALE SPEAKER: Andy, what's
on your reading list?


841
0:30:49,17 --> 0:30:51,11
ANDY WEIR: What's
on my reading list?


842
0:30:51,11 --> 0:30:54,55
I really like to read the old
classic sci-fi stuff, which


843
0:30:54,55 --> 0:30:57,46
I've read before and just
keep reading again and again.


844
0:30:57,46 --> 0:31:0,48
So Heinlein, Clarke,
Asimov, that sort of thing.


845
0:31:0,48 --> 0:31:1,86
Those are my favorite authors.


846
0:31:1,86 --> 0:31:4,86
And then also anything by
Terry Pratchett, completely out


847
0:31:4,86 --> 0:31:7,92
of the sci-fi world,
but Terry Pratchett.


848
0:31:7,92 --> 0:31:10,86
Also I really like
Robert Asprin.


849
0:31:10,86 --> 0:31:12,45
But he died.


850
0:31:12,45 --> 0:31:14,412
But that apparently
didn't stop him


851
0:31:14,412 --> 0:31:15,87
from making new
books because I see


852
0:31:15,87 --> 0:31:19,31
there's a new release
that's by Robert Asprin.


853
0:31:19,31 --> 0:31:21,56
And I'm not sure
how that happened.


854
0:31:21,56 --> 0:31:23,284
So either someone
else has taken up


855
0:31:23,284 --> 0:31:24,7
the role of writing
Robert Asprin.


856
0:31:24,7 --> 0:31:25,199
Books.


857
0:31:25,199 --> 0:31:27,44
Or it's some manuscript
he was partially through,


858
0:31:27,44 --> 0:31:28,896
or I don't know.


859
0:31:28,896 --> 0:31:30,52
AUDIENCE: So right
after "The Martian,"


860
0:31:30,52 --> 0:31:31,895
I read-- speaking
of old sci-fi--


861
0:31:31,895 --> 0:31:35,66
if I read "When Worlds Collide,"
which is from 1933, I think.


862
0:31:35,66 --> 0:31:39,19
And the jump from
scientific accuracy


863
0:31:39,19 --> 0:31:42,571
to scientific hand-waving
was never so great.


864
0:31:42,571 --> 0:31:43,82
Because there was a spaceship.


865
0:31:43,82 --> 0:31:44,47
And they fly.


866
0:31:44,47 --> 0:31:47,405
And they just sort of say, yeah,
let's build a spaceship now.


867
0:31:47,405 --> 0:31:48,78
And we'll fly to
this new planet.


868
0:31:48,78 --> 0:31:49,695
And that'll work.


869
0:31:49,695 --> 0:31:51,23
ANDY WEIR: It seems reasonable.


870
0:31:51,23 --> 0:31:53,77
Or when they're like--
oh, I never read the book


871
0:31:53,77 --> 0:31:55,66
but I saw the movie
from the '50s--


872
0:31:55,66 --> 0:31:57,99
and they land their
spaceship on the new planet,


873
0:31:57,99 --> 0:31:59,48
the one that just destroyed
Earth, and they're like,


874
0:31:59,48 --> 0:32:0,19
well, let's go outside.


875
0:32:0,19 --> 0:32:0,8
And they're like, what?


876
0:32:0,8 --> 0:32:2,38
You don't know if the
atmosphere is good.


877
0:32:2,38 --> 0:32:3,921
And it's like, well,
if it's no good,


878
0:32:3,921 --> 0:32:6,41
we're all going to die anyway.


879
0:32:6,41 --> 0:32:7,85
Yeah, it's good.


880
0:32:7,85 --> 0:32:10,515
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]


881
0:32:10,515 --> 0:32:12,14
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
speaking of old sci-fi,


882
0:32:12,14 --> 0:32:14,74
there was a couple of the
early Doc Smith novels


883
0:32:14,74 --> 0:32:17,7
that had roughly the
same set-up-- guy


884
0:32:17,7 --> 0:32:19,25
crashes on an
outer system planet


885
0:32:19,25 --> 0:32:24,9
and has to build up civilization
until he can make a radio.


886
0:32:24,9 --> 0:32:25,29
Have you read any of those?


887
0:32:25,29 --> 0:32:28,64
And can you bring yourself to
having done the research now?


888
0:32:28,64 --> 0:32:31,44
ANDY WEIR: I did not
read any of those.


889
0:32:31,44 --> 0:32:34,29
As for the research, that was
just really important to me.


890
0:32:34,29 --> 0:32:37,59
I just wanted to be as
accurate as I possibly could.


891
0:32:37,59 --> 0:32:39,422
There are a few places
that are inaccurate.


892
0:32:39,422 --> 0:32:40,88
The biggest place
that's inaccurate


893
0:32:40,88 --> 0:32:43,26
is right at the beginning.


894
0:32:43,26 --> 0:32:46,35
Don't tell anybody, but if
you're in a dust storm on Mars,


895
0:32:46,35 --> 0:32:47,82
you're not even
going to feel it.


896
0:32:47,82 --> 0:32:50,29
Mars' atmosphere is
less than 1% of Earth's.


897
0:32:50,29 --> 0:32:53,36
So a 150 kilometer an
hour wind would feel


898
0:32:53,36 --> 0:32:56,19
like about a 1 kilometer
an hour wind does on Earth.


899
0:32:56,19 --> 0:32:57,78
It wouldn't do any
damage to anything.


900
0:32:57,78 --> 0:32:59,76
Shh.


901
0:32:59,76 --> 0:33:1,9
I had other ways of doing it.


902
0:33:1,9 --> 0:33:4,93
I had an idea where the MAV
would have some sort of failure


903
0:33:4,93 --> 0:33:7,44
that caused an explosion
which does all the damage.


904
0:33:7,44 --> 0:33:9,73
And they're short on
time because the MAV fuel


905
0:33:9,73 --> 0:33:11,48
tank is leaking, so
they need to lift off.


906
0:33:11,48 --> 0:33:13,521
And they're sure Mark's
dead and stuff like that.


907
0:33:13,521 --> 0:33:17,945
But most people don't know
how Martian dust storms work.


908
0:33:17,945 --> 0:33:19,57
Most people don't
realize that it's not


909
0:33:19,57 --> 0:33:20,91
like being in a sand blaster.


910
0:33:20,91 --> 0:33:22,451
And it's just more
dramatic that way.


911
0:33:22,451 --> 0:33:24,22
So I just made that concession.


912
0:33:24,22 --> 0:33:27,36
I know I'm a liar.


913
0:33:27,36 --> 0:33:28,87
I just wanted that more.


914
0:33:28,87 --> 0:33:30,58
It was more dramatic.


915
0:33:30,58 --> 0:33:36,31
AUDIENCE: So there used to be a
sci-fi story by George Landis.


916
0:33:36,31 --> 0:33:40,505
The title was "A
Walk in the Sun."


917
0:33:40,505 --> 0:33:42,13
There was an accident,
and an astronaut


918
0:33:42,13 --> 0:33:45,36
has to survive by her
own on the moon for one


919
0:33:45,36 --> 0:33:47,36
month until rescuers arrive.


920
0:33:47,36 --> 0:33:49,41
So that's very similar
to this set-up.


921
0:33:49,41 --> 0:33:50,245
Have you read that?


922
0:33:50,245 --> 0:33:51,12
ANDY WEIR: I haven't.


923
0:33:51,12 --> 0:33:51,855
AUDIENCE: OK.


924
0:33:51,855 --> 0:33:54,43
ANDY WEIR: But
basically "The Martian"


925
0:33:54,43 --> 0:33:57,942
can be described as Robinson
Crusoe on Mars, right?


926
0:33:57,942 --> 0:33:59,4
Except for there
was a movie called


927
0:33:59,4 --> 0:34:1,922
"Robinson Crusoe on
Mars," and my story


928
0:34:1,922 --> 0:34:3,255
does not have a monkey sidekick.


929
0:34:3,255 --> 0:34:5,867



930
0:34:5,867 --> 0:34:7,867
AUDIENCE: You should
consider a monkey sidekick.


931
0:34:7,867 --> 0:34:9,32
Yeah, are you considering one?


932
0:34:9,32 --> 0:34:11,486
ANDY WEIR: There should
have been a monkey sidekick.


933
0:34:11,486 --> 0:34:12,19
I see that now.


934
0:34:12,19 --> 0:34:15,66
AUDIENCE: If they adapt this
for Hollywood, [INAUDIBLE].


935
0:34:15,66 --> 0:34:18,35
ANDY WEIR: There's clearly
going to be a monkey sidekick.


936
0:34:18,35 --> 0:34:19,786
There would have to be.


937
0:34:19,786 --> 0:34:21,48
Well, they might adapt
it for Hollywood.


938
0:34:21,48 --> 0:34:23,31
20th Century Fox optioned
the movie rights.


939
0:34:23,31 --> 0:34:25,639
So they could make a movie.


940
0:34:25,639 --> 0:34:26,677
We'll see.


941
0:34:26,677 --> 0:34:28,76
AUDIENCE: The most important
question, when can we


942
0:34:28,76 --> 0:34:30,65
expect another book from you?


943
0:34:30,65 --> 0:34:31,689
ANDY WEIR: Well, I'm
working on a pitch


944
0:34:31,689 --> 0:34:33,7
right now for my next book.


945
0:34:33,7 --> 0:34:35,487
But I've been so
busy with the-- it's


946
0:34:35,487 --> 0:34:37,7
real busy for a
writer around the time


947
0:34:37,7 --> 0:34:38,85
his book comes out,
let me tell you.


948
0:34:38,85 --> 0:34:40,79
So I've been doing
stuff related to that.


949
0:34:40,79 --> 0:34:43,801
But as soon as things calm
down, I'll work on the pitch.


950
0:34:43,801 --> 0:34:45,8
And then if they like it,
I'll start writing it.


951
0:34:45,8 --> 0:34:47,76
And it'll probably
take me maybe a year.


952
0:34:47,76 --> 0:34:50,135
AUDIENCE: Or you could just
self-publish it and put it up


953
0:34:50,135 --> 0:34:51,56
on Amazon if they don't like it.


954
0:34:51,56 --> 0:34:56,1
ANDY WEIR: If Random House
gives me a bunch of money,


955
0:34:56,1 --> 0:34:58,94
they're going to want me
not to put it up for free.


956
0:34:58,94 --> 0:35:1,109
AUDIENCE: Not
free, but you know.


957
0:35:1,109 --> 0:35:2,4
As long as you write something.


958
0:35:2,4 --> 0:35:3,67
I mean, seriously,
this is the best


959
0:35:3,67 --> 0:35:4,92
book I've read in a long time.


960
0:35:4,92 --> 0:35:6,11
ANDY WEIR: Well, thank you.


961
0:35:6,11 --> 0:35:7,0
Glad you liked it.


962
0:35:7,0 --> 0:35:9,75
AUDIENCE: I will say I'm
only halfway through it.


963
0:35:9,75 --> 0:35:11,76
But that's got to be
the best first line


964
0:35:11,76 --> 0:35:15,928
since "it was a dark
and stormy night."


965
0:35:15,928 --> 0:35:16,922
ANDY WEIR: Thank you.


966
0:35:16,922 --> 0:35:19,909



967
0:35:19,909 --> 0:35:21,95
I figure you have one line
to convince the reader


968
0:35:21,95 --> 0:35:23,267
to read the first paragraph.


969
0:35:23,267 --> 0:35:24,85
And you have one
paragraph to convince


970
0:35:24,85 --> 0:35:26,31
them to read the first page.


971
0:35:26,31 --> 0:35:27,934
And if they read the
first page, you've


972
0:35:27,934 --> 0:35:29,86
probably got them
for a while anyway.


973
0:35:29,86 --> 0:35:32,15
But that first
line is important.


974
0:35:32,15 --> 0:35:32,74
AUDIENCE: I was going
to say, partially


975
0:35:32,74 --> 0:35:35,114
to what you were saying before,
even if the atmosphere is


976
0:35:35,114 --> 0:35:37,83
really thin but it's blowing
around chunks of sand,


977
0:35:37,83 --> 0:35:40,2
wouldn't the mass of the sand
moving at that speed still


978
0:35:40,2 --> 0:35:41,117
cause a lot of damage?


979
0:35:41,117 --> 0:35:43,408
ANDY WEIR: Right, but the
sand that it's blowing around


980
0:35:43,408 --> 0:35:45,574
in a dust storm is basically
like talcum powder.


981
0:35:45,574 --> 0:35:46,49
AUDIENCE: Fair enough.


982
0:35:46,49 --> 0:35:47,74
ANDY WEIR: It's not
like big granules.


983
0:35:47,74 --> 0:35:49,615
AUDIENCE: The actual
question I was going ask


984
0:35:49,615 --> 0:35:51,86
is how much of the ending
and sort of storyboard


985
0:35:51,86 --> 0:35:53,73
was known when you
started the book,


986
0:35:53,73 --> 0:35:56,197
and how much was made
up as you went along?


987
0:35:56,197 --> 0:35:58,28
ANDY WEIR: Most of it was
made up as I went along.


988
0:35:58,28 --> 0:36:0,19
I had some ideas for
how the ending would go.


989
0:36:0,19 --> 0:36:2,58
And it didn't go that way
because it didn't make sense


990
0:36:2,58 --> 0:36:4,64
with how the story developed.


991
0:36:4,64 --> 0:36:9,44
They say there are two kinds
of writers-- the plotters


992
0:36:9,44 --> 0:36:11,264
and the pantsers, right?


993
0:36:11,264 --> 0:36:13,68
Plotters work everything out
in an outline format and say,


994
0:36:13,68 --> 0:36:14,46
this is what's going to happen.


995
0:36:14,46 --> 0:36:16,88
Pantsers are like, eh,
let's just see what happens.


996
0:36:16,88 --> 0:36:18,91
And I'm the latter, for sure.


997
0:36:18,91 --> 0:36:21,55
So at the end, I
had this in my mind


998
0:36:21,55 --> 0:36:22,93
the whole time I'm
writing the book is here's


999
0:36:22,93 --> 0:36:23,95
what the final
scene's going to be.


1000
0:36:23,95 --> 0:36:24,94
And it's going to be awesome.


1001
0:36:24,94 --> 0:36:25,77
Here's how it's going to be.


1002
0:36:25,77 --> 0:36:26,936
And it couldn't be that way.


1003
0:36:26,936 --> 0:36:30,4



1004
0:36:30,4 --> 0:36:32,92
AUDIENCE: So related to
that, your protagonist


1005
0:36:32,92 --> 0:36:34,607
has to overcome a
lot of problems.


1006
0:36:34,607 --> 0:36:35,44
So which came first?


1007
0:36:35,44 --> 0:36:37,93
The problems that you'd have
to find a clever solution for?


1008
0:36:37,93 --> 0:36:39,8
Or you came up with
the solution and said,


1009
0:36:39,8 --> 0:36:40,41
how do I get in that situation?


1010
0:36:40,41 --> 0:36:41,46
ANDY WEIR: I would
start with the problems.


1011
0:36:41,46 --> 0:36:43,779
What I wanted to do
was have the problems--


1012
0:36:43,779 --> 0:36:45,82
I didn't want him to just
get struck by lightning


1013
0:36:45,82 --> 0:36:48,74
over and over, figuratively.


1014
0:36:48,74 --> 0:36:52,12
I didn't want there to
be too many coincidences.


1015
0:36:52,12 --> 0:36:54,36
So I wanted all of his
problems to either derive


1016
0:36:54,36 --> 0:36:57,36
from the fact that he's
using outdated equipment,


1017
0:36:57,36 --> 0:36:59,6
or that he's using
equipment in ways


1018
0:36:59,6 --> 0:37:0,83
that it wasn't
intended to be used.


1019
0:37:0,83 --> 0:37:2,91
So the solution to
his previous problem


1020
0:37:2,91 --> 0:37:5,19
would often cause
the next problem.


1021
0:37:5,19 --> 0:37:8,5
And so I would try to come
up with the problems first.


1022
0:37:8,5 --> 0:37:9,61
Then I'd come up
with the solutions.


1023
0:37:9,61 --> 0:37:12,98
The cool thing is, though,
being a writer I can cheat.


1024
0:37:12,98 --> 0:37:15,67
So every now and then,
I'd get him into trouble,


1025
0:37:15,67 --> 0:37:17,42
and I'd be like, he
can't get out of this.


1026
0:37:17,42 --> 0:37:18,196
He's going to die.


1027
0:37:18,196 --> 0:37:19,82
OK, I'm going to go
back a few chapters


1028
0:37:19,82 --> 0:37:23,942
and put in some stuff that,
oh, and this leads to that


1029
0:37:23,942 --> 0:37:24,9
and this leads to that.


1030
0:37:24,9 --> 0:37:27,24
And here's this thing
that he'll have access


1031
0:37:27,24 --> 0:37:30,72
to which can solve this problem.


1032
0:37:30,72 --> 0:37:32,53
AUDIENCE: I don't know how much
insight you have into this,


1033
0:37:32,53 --> 0:37:35,509
but which of your
sales channels seems


1034
0:37:35,509 --> 0:37:37,5
to be doing best in
this day and age?


1035
0:37:37,5 --> 0:37:40,54
So I've found the book
on [INAUDIBLE] blog


1036
0:37:40,54 --> 0:37:43,457
and read it in
the last few days.


1037
0:37:43,457 --> 0:37:45,4
How much does that
sort of thing help?


1038
0:37:45,4 --> 0:37:47,646
And electronic versus physical?


1039
0:37:47,646 --> 0:37:49,27
ANDY WEIR: The answer
is, I don't know.


1040
0:37:49,27 --> 0:37:55,13
I do know that right now, in
this release-- so it released


1041
0:37:55,13 --> 0:37:56,94
officially two
days ago, so we're


1042
0:37:56,94 --> 0:37:59,21
just right at the
beginning-- I do know


1043
0:37:59,21 --> 0:38:1,73
that the digital
version is outselling


1044
0:38:1,73 --> 0:38:2,72
the physical version.


1045
0:38:2,72 --> 0:38:6,36



1046
0:38:6,36 --> 0:38:12,69
That's usually the case early
on because there's still


1047
0:38:12,69 --> 0:38:16,53
pipelining and delivery
hiccups here and there


1048
0:38:16,53 --> 0:38:17,71
for various bookstores.


1049
0:38:17,71 --> 0:38:21,14
And we also don't get a lot of
our reports from bookstores.


1050
0:38:21,14 --> 0:38:23,0
But anyway, more
specific than that,


1051
0:38:23,0 --> 0:38:25,6
when it comes down
to how did somebody


1052
0:38:25,6 --> 0:38:27,1
end up at the page
where they buy it?


1053
0:38:27,1 --> 0:38:27,71
I don't know.


1054
0:38:27,71 --> 0:38:31,36
I don't have that data.


1055
0:38:31,36 --> 0:38:33,531
AUDIENCE: But you do
think that posting


1056
0:38:33,531 --> 0:38:35,55
to whatever was a good idea?


1057
0:38:35,55 --> 0:38:39,88
ANDY WEIR: Oh, well, so that was
mostly-- in fact, all of that--


1058
0:38:39,88 --> 0:38:42,81
was arranged by Random House's
marketing and publicity.


1059
0:38:42,81 --> 0:38:44,875
So they said, like,
then they arranged it


1060
0:38:44,875 --> 0:38:50,91
with the site owners and blogs
and stuff like that, and said,


1061
0:38:50,91 --> 0:38:51,59
we'd like you to
be on all of these.


1062
0:38:51,59 --> 0:38:54,18
Let's see which ones of them
are interested in having you.


1063
0:38:54,18 --> 0:38:57,16
And they do that
kind of matchmaking.


1064
0:38:57,16 --> 0:38:59,15
I have this big
folder full of what


1065
0:38:59,15 --> 0:39:1,844
I called homework, just essays
and articles and things that I


1066
0:39:1,844 --> 0:39:3,51
write, which was one
of the reasons I've


1067
0:39:3,51 --> 0:39:7,822
been too busy to work
on the next book.


1068
0:39:7,822 --> 0:39:9,53
AUDIENCE: So do you
still have a day job?


1069
0:39:9,53 --> 0:39:11,13
Or are you now a
full-time writer?


1070
0:39:11,13 --> 0:39:12,5
ANDY WEIR: I still
have a day job.


1071
0:39:12,5 --> 0:39:13,0
I work for MobileIron.


1072
0:39:13,0 --> 0:39:15,37
I am an Android programmer.


1073
0:39:15,37 --> 0:39:21,46
And I've warned everybody at
my company so they know this.


1074
0:39:21,46 --> 0:39:24,742
If I get an advance for this
next novel that I'm pitching,


1075
0:39:24,742 --> 0:39:26,2
then I'm going to
quit the day job.


1076
0:39:26,2 --> 0:39:29,182



1077
0:39:29,182 --> 0:39:31,39
AUDIENCE: Maybe you don't
know the specifics of this,


1078
0:39:31,39 --> 0:39:37,52
but what with the vagaries of
having been published twice,


1079
0:39:37,52 --> 0:39:42,11
are you eligible for
next year's Hugos?


1080
0:39:42,11 --> 0:39:45,6
ANDY WEIR: I don't know.


1081
0:39:45,6 --> 0:39:48,122
I hadn't thought
about awards at all.


1082
0:39:48,122 --> 0:39:51,914
(WHISPERING) I'll find out.


1083
0:39:51,914 --> 0:39:54,8
AUDIENCE: What did you think
of the movie "Gravity"?


1084
0:39:54,8 --> 0:39:55,4
ANDY WEIR: I liked it a lot.


1085
0:39:55,4 --> 0:39:57,25
I thought it was really
beautiful cinematography,


1086
0:39:57,25 --> 0:39:57,99
first off.


1087
0:39:57,99 --> 0:40:2,64
And it had a bunch
of accuracy problems.


1088
0:40:2,64 --> 0:40:6,12
But, I mean, you
can't get too picky.


1089
0:40:6,12 --> 0:40:10,7
It wasn't supposed to be
a space station tutorial.


1090
0:40:10,7 --> 0:40:12,77
It was supposed to
be an exciting movie.


1091
0:40:12,77 --> 0:40:13,53
And what was it?


1092
0:40:13,53 --> 0:40:17,8
Like for one thing,
ISS and the Hubble


1093
0:40:17,8 --> 0:40:19,89
are in orbits that are
nowhere near each other,


1094
0:40:19,89 --> 0:40:21,2
nowhere near the same velocity.


1095
0:40:21,2 --> 0:40:26,34
In fact, NASA did, at one
point, try to arrange a mission


1096
0:40:26,34 --> 0:40:28,607
where they would repair
the Hubble from ISS.


1097
0:40:28,607 --> 0:40:30,69
And they could not find
any way to make that work.


1098
0:40:30,69 --> 0:40:33,55



1099
0:40:33,55 --> 0:40:36,28
So there are few
errors in "Gravity,"


1100
0:40:36,28 --> 0:40:37,79
but I liked it a lot.


1101
0:40:37,79 --> 0:40:40,74
It is kind of inconvenient,
though, because I released


1102
0:40:40,74 --> 0:40:42,62
"The Martian" before
"Gravity" came out.


1103
0:40:42,62 --> 0:40:44,581
I wrote it all before
"Gravity" came out.


1104
0:40:44,581 --> 0:40:46,8
Now the re-release
of "The Martian,"


1105
0:40:46,8 --> 0:40:49,172
people are like, oh, hey,
this is like "Gravity."


1106
0:40:49,172 --> 0:40:51,0
I'm like, no,
"Gravity"'s like me.


1107
0:40:51,0 --> 0:40:55,15



1108
0:40:55,15 --> 0:40:57,209
AUDIENCE: I was
wondering, did you


1109
0:40:57,209 --> 0:40:58,75
manage to get any
input on the cover?


1110
0:40:58,75 --> 0:41:0,52
I mean, it looks really nice.


1111
0:41:0,52 --> 0:41:1,81
ANDY WEIR: Thanks.


1112
0:41:1,81 --> 0:41:3,99
That's actually funny.


1113
0:41:3,99 --> 0:41:6,26
I didn't like it.


1114
0:41:6,26 --> 0:41:10,23
And they said, hey, here's
the cover we're going to go.


1115
0:41:10,23 --> 0:41:11,605
The Random House's
art department


1116
0:41:11,605 --> 0:41:14,4
said-- here's this
whole big thing


1117
0:41:14,4 --> 0:41:17,3
that they did-- and
they said, here it is.


1118
0:41:17,3 --> 0:41:19,65
And I said, I don't like it.


1119
0:41:19,65 --> 0:41:21,33
But everybody else does.


1120
0:41:21,33 --> 0:41:23,45
So I'm glad I was wrong.


1121
0:41:23,45 --> 0:41:24,79
Or I'm glad-- how do I put it?


1122
0:41:24,79 --> 0:41:26,13
I'm glad I didn't have any say.


1123
0:41:26,13 --> 0:41:30,71



1124
0:41:30,71 --> 0:41:32,29
Although I did point
out one problem.


1125
0:41:32,29 --> 0:41:36,35
Originally, in the-- that's an
actual photo of an astronaut


1126
0:41:36,35 --> 0:41:39,43
who is on a space shuttle
mission at the time


1127
0:41:39,43 --> 0:41:40,55
this photo was taken.


1128
0:41:40,55 --> 0:41:43,37
I mean, obviously all the
red stuff is Photoshopped.


1129
0:41:43,37 --> 0:41:46,1
But in his helmet, you
could see the reflection


1130
0:41:46,1 --> 0:41:48,18
of the space shuttle cargo bay.


1131
0:41:48,18 --> 0:41:49,39
And I pointed that.


1132
0:41:49,39 --> 0:41:50,36
I'm like, nah.


1133
0:41:50,36 --> 0:41:53,79
So they fixed that.


1134
0:41:53,79 --> 0:41:55,59
AUDIENCE: What would you prefer?


1135
0:41:55,59 --> 0:42:0,72
ANDY WEIR: I imagined--
well, the Dutch cover--


1136
0:42:0,72 --> 0:42:3,14
so every language
that's selling-- it's


1137
0:42:3,14 --> 0:42:5,39
getting translated
into 21 languages


1138
0:42:5,39 --> 0:42:9,16
and pretty much every one of
them has their own cover art.


1139
0:42:9,16 --> 0:42:11,9
And the Dutch cover is
kind of what I liked.


1140
0:42:11,9 --> 0:42:15,8
It's just basically a
lone figure, very small,


1141
0:42:15,8 --> 0:42:19,91
like, in the middle there and
just big, empty Martian scenery


1142
0:42:19,91 --> 0:42:22,7
just to show there's
isolation and stuff.


1143
0:42:22,7 --> 0:42:23,54
And I thought that was cool.


1144
0:42:23,54 --> 0:42:25,46
But this is like--
there are actually


1145
0:42:25,46 --> 0:42:27,662
websites that just judge
books by their cover.


1146
0:42:27,662 --> 0:42:29,12
Like that's literally
what they do.


1147
0:42:29,12 --> 0:42:29,619
They say--


1148
0:42:29,619 --> 0:42:32,594
[LAUGHTER]


1149
0:42:32,594 --> 0:42:34,1
Literally all they
do is they say,


1150
0:42:34,1 --> 0:42:36,16
like, we're rating
covers of new release,


1151
0:42:36,16 --> 0:42:38,82
not the content of
the book, nothing.


1152
0:42:38,82 --> 0:42:41,69
Just think of them as
artistic analysis websites.


1153
0:42:41,69 --> 0:42:44,2
And they loved the
cover of "The Martian."


1154
0:42:44,2 --> 0:42:45,95
AUDIENCE: By the way,
great title, too.


1155
0:42:45,95 --> 0:42:47,379
ANDY WEIR: Thanks.


1156
0:42:47,379 --> 0:42:49,42
Yeah, a lot of people will
say, oh, like pro tip,


1157
0:42:49,42 --> 0:42:52,14
there's no actual
Martians in this.


1158
0:42:52,14 --> 0:42:53,28
There's no aliens.


1159
0:42:53,28 --> 0:42:57,23
He's the Martian, you see,
because he's stuck there.


1160
0:42:57,23 --> 0:42:59,96
MALE SPEAKER: Tell me,
so how did you actually


1161
0:42:59,96 --> 0:43:4,144
start to think about writing
a story of somebody on Mars?


1162
0:43:4,144 --> 0:43:5,81
I know we talked a
little bit about this


1163
0:43:5,81 --> 0:43:7,68
before the talk itself.


1164
0:43:7,68 --> 0:43:10,4
We're sort of an Apollo
generation type of thing.


1165
0:43:10,4 --> 0:43:14,21
But what was that
moment that's, hey,


1166
0:43:14,21 --> 0:43:15,82
I'm going to write
a story about Mars.


1167
0:43:15,82 --> 0:43:16,72
Why?


1168
0:43:16,72 --> 0:43:19,19
ANDY WEIR: Well,
dork that I am, I


1169
0:43:19,19 --> 0:43:22,7
was imagining how a manned
Mars mission could work.


1170
0:43:22,7 --> 0:43:25,7
And so I was just trying
to say, realistically,


1171
0:43:25,7 --> 0:43:27,81
how do you get the
astronauts to Mars?


1172
0:43:27,81 --> 0:43:30,16
How do you build a ship
big enough to support them?


1173
0:43:30,16 --> 0:43:31,251
How does that work?


1174
0:43:31,251 --> 0:43:32,25
How do you get it there?


1175
0:43:32,25 --> 0:43:34,416
That's why I had use ion
engines because it was just


1176
0:43:34,416 --> 0:43:35,754
too implausible otherwise.


1177
0:43:35,754 --> 0:43:37,67
It's like once they're
there, what do they do?


1178
0:43:37,67 --> 0:43:39,38
How do they get back?


1179
0:43:39,38 --> 0:43:41,78
And, oh, you could send all
the supplies in advance.


1180
0:43:41,78 --> 0:43:45,244
It uses heavily from
Mars Direct, which is--


1181
0:43:45,244 --> 0:43:46,41
MALE SPEAKER: Zubrin's plan.


1182
0:43:46,41 --> 0:43:49,46
ANDY WEIR: Yeah,
Zubrin's suggested


1183
0:43:49,46 --> 0:43:52,36
way of doing a Mars
mission, which if and when


1184
0:43:52,36 --> 0:43:54,94
we have a Mars mission
in the real world,


1185
0:43:54,94 --> 0:43:56,51
it will almost certainly be
something very much like that.


1186
0:43:56,51 --> 0:43:59,91
Anyway I was considering all
the things that could go wrong.


1187
0:43:59,91 --> 0:44:1,56
I was saying, any
mission plan has


1188
0:44:1,56 --> 0:44:3,726
to account for things that
can go wrong and say, oh,


1189
0:44:3,726 --> 0:44:5,86
if this happens, then the
astronaut should do this.


1190
0:44:5,86 --> 0:44:7,42
If this happens,
they should do this.


1191
0:44:7,42 --> 0:44:9,67
And I started thinking of
all these failure scenarios.


1192
0:44:9,67 --> 0:44:12,59
And those started to seem
really interesting to me.


1193
0:44:12,59 --> 0:44:14,755
So I made a poor,
hapless main character


1194
0:44:14,755 --> 0:44:15,88
to suffer through them all.


1195
0:44:15,88 --> 0:44:18,647



1196
0:44:18,647 --> 0:44:21,23
MALE SPEAKER: The readers won't
suffer if they read this book.


1197
0:44:21,23 --> 0:44:22,14
I'm sure about that.


1198
0:44:22,14 --> 0:44:24,63
So please give
thanks to Andy Weir.


1199
0:44:24,63 --> 0:46:24,63
[APPLAUSE]
