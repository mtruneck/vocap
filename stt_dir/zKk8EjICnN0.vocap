###1 An out-of-this-world theory on how nothing turned into something, a giant
###5 fossil human footprint, and we dive into the mailbox - this is Genesis week.
###10 [music]
###26 And a welcome to this episode of Genesis Week, the weekly program of creationary
###31 commentary on news, views and events pertaining to the origins controversy,
###35 exclusive right here on youtube.  Still one of the most discussed videos on youtube
###40 in science & technology, we bring you the information the anti-creationists don't
###44 want you to see or hear, and we  show the glory of God in the Creation.

###61 Alan Boyle, of Cosmic log on MSNBC had an interview with theoretical physicist
###67 Lawrence Krauss.  Krauss, head of the Origins Project at Arizona State
###72 University, tackled the question of "How did everything come from nothing?" in his
###76 latest book entitled "A Universe from Nothing."
###80 So how exactly do you get a universe from nothing? As Boyle explained it, by
###84 calling upon energy to be converted into matter - following the suit of Einstein's
###90 relativitistic theory, combined with
###101 That's right, it can work.....if we violate the laws of physics.  translation: it would
###109 be a miracle.
###110 I admire Krauss's brutal honesty - we creationists have been pointing out for
###115 decades that the origin of the universe and life requires a miracle - a defiance of
###121 the laws and nature and physics. But notice that while they are willing to
###126 accept a miracle, they will not accept the possibility of a miracle worker - Our
###131 Creator, Jesus Christ?
###132 Krause said:
###176 Wow. One comment on the blog, left by UnitedStates1776, summed up this utter
###183 nonsense nicely:  "I am possible, therefore I will be."  Krauss has envisioned a very
###191 introspective universe that needs to plan ahead in order to even be.  Forget about "I
###198 think, therefore I am" - this is "I will be, therefore I must think of how I can be, so I
###206 can think."
###209 Krauss defended his position by saying:
###223 Wait a minute! You were talking about a magical, mystical fantasy land where the
###229 laws of physics are different or perhaps don't even exist, and now somehow you
###233 think this helps people learn about reality?
###238 Read the blog post yourself, then tell me what you think in the comments down
###242 below: Do you think Krauss is on to something? Or is he perhaps on
###246 something?  Or do you think Krauss should be on something?
###251 In Jesus' Name Productions is working on a movie that re-enacts Noah's flood.
###256 Producer Joe Bardwell invited both Christian old-earth advocates and Young
###260 Earth Christians to present their models of how Noah's flood happened, or didn't
###265 happen, in a peer-reviewed panel format. Joe then held a competition for ten people
###271 in a technical review panel, of which I earned a spot. Our job as the technical
###276 review panel was to rip all of these models apart, scientifically, if we could.
###281 Several old-earth advocates declined to participate, but their models and
###285 arguments were scrutinized as non-responding authors.  Six Young Earth
###290 Creation models; both flood and pre-flood world models, were defended by their
###293 authors in the technical review.  The competition and technical review itself
###297 went on for some two years, and the findings of the review were published in a
###302 massive e-book.  This is a must-read for anyone interested in geology, flood
###308 geology, Biblical catastrophism, uniformitarianism, actualism, etc...  The
###313 book is available for instant download for a donation of your choosing.  If you could
###319 though, please make it a generous donation, as Joe put tens of thousands of
###323 dollars into this important project. This book, in my opinion, is going to
###328 impact both the creation and evolution community as much as the landmark book
###333 "The Genesis Flood."  You can get your copy here at In Jesus Name Productions.
###340 This past week, Teno Groppi handed me a video of an alleged fossil human footprint
###345 found in South Africa. I shortly thereafter got bombarded with questions from
###349 viewers, asking my opinion on this track. I was actually very grateful to see the
###353 video, as Teno and I both belong to a discussion group about fossil footprints,
###357 and someone had posted some rather poor photos of this alleged track.
###362 Michael Tellinger posted a video report of this odd feature in the rock, and they did
###367 a splendid job of showing the anomaly. I'm afraid to report however, for multiple
###372 reasons, I do not believe this is a fossil human footprint.
###375 The "footprint" is in granite. Now the conventional belief is that granite forms
###381 from a melt.  If that is the case, then you have humans walking around, leaving
###385 footprints in molten rock.  Obviously, this is impossible.  But even if the granite
###390 formed in a cold process, I still do not think it's a human footprint.  For example,
###395 do watch the video yourself - here's the link right here, where is the mud that was
###401 displaced by the foot making the footprint? There isn't any.  On a track that
###406 deep, there should be some - in fact, quite a bit.  Secondly, I have personally
###410 investigated erosional features such as those that make up the toes in this
###414 "track," in multiple locations.  It is caused by fracture and erosion, and in fact
###421 several geologist friends and I were discussing how this could happen.  In fact,
###425 in the video you can see some other overhangs off to the left of the track, in
###430 the rock face.  They just do not bear any resemblance to toes or anything, but they
###434 are fracture and erosional features just like you see in the footprint.
###438 A Professor Pieter Wagener is quoted regarding the allegation of erosional
###442 features, saying
###452 With respect Professor Wagener, as one of the leading fossil human footprint
###457 experts within the Creation community, I get typically 1 to 3 requests per year to
###462 come investigate alleged fossil human footprints.  Of all the investigations I have
###467 carried out, only one of them appeared to be genuine. All the others turned out to
###472 be foot print-shaped depressions, wave ripples, fractures or erosion in rock -
###477 including granite and gneiss.  Some of them, were in fact, even more convincing
###482 that the South African feature.  And you know what I have learned over the years?
###487 People get really really angry when you tell them their fossil human footprint isn't
###491 a fossil human footprint. The fact is that you can so can get so
###495 many shapes and depressions in rocks, that you will get footprint impressions -
###498 human or otherwise. These are pseudo fossils.  It is just for this reason that
###503 typically a dinosaur track is not considered genuine unless you have
###507 three tracks in a row, or other tracks in that immediate locality.  The absense of a
###514 trail of human footprints at the South Africa site is also a major blow to the
###519 authenticity of this feature being a human footprint.
###522 So while I must regretably say that "No, it is not a fossil human footprint," I must
###528 say well done to MIchael Tellinger on his report. Thank you - you did an excellent
###532 job of reporting this feature, showing video from a far off, as well as close-in
###537 detail.  This was much better documentation then I'd seen thus far, so I
###543 am grateful, thanks for your hard work.

###551 Wahoo! Mail for me?
###553 [scary, dramatic music]
###557 Genesis week has again found itself in the top ten of most discussed videos for the
###561 week in science and technology on youtube.  I got a barrage of emails from
###565 skeptics wanting me to cover thermodynamics on Genesis Week, and
###568 claiming that because I hadn't covered it, my silence must be acknowledgement
###571 that I was wrong about what I said a few weeks back.  Actually, if you recall, I said I
###576 was going to make a video dedicated to the subject.  I am still working on it - I am
###580 producing this show weekly, which is a lot of work, I'm working on a book, and I'm
###584 appearing on the Creation Today program, so I've been swamped.  So just
###589 ....be patient!  My - I've never had such a large group of people begging me to give
###594 them a public caning!
###597 Some viewers wrote in last week:
###615 Thanks for writing in, but apparently you missed the point.  You admit in your
###620 comments that the evolutionism myth claims bird hips evolved from lizard hips.
###625 To change a lizard hip into a bird hip takes major re-engineering of the
###629 structure of the entire organism - muscles need to be moved, removed, attached
###634 elsewhere along with the major bone changes.  Yet, you somehow seem to think
###638 this outlandish story is more believable if some of the dinosaurs kept their lizard
###643 hips? Look, you are welcome to believe that lizard hips kept right on trucking in
###648 different organisms, but that frankly is quite irrelevent to the discussion of
###652 whether or not lizard hips could even evolve into bird hips.
###691 Actually, ten times in the first chapter of Genesis alone, it says God created life to
###697 reproduce after its kind.  Of course what we actually see in the fossil record lines
###703 up with Genesis - we see extinction, and stasis - organisms reproducing faithfully
###710 after their kind.  That is what is observable.  Evolution is not observable,
###715 testable, nor repeatable.
###717 Vegavis also wrote in about Protoavis:
###744 Thanks for writing in, however multiple paleontologists, including my good friend
###748 Joe Taylor who actually saw the original protoavis fossil with his own two eyes,
###753 see the fossil as a completely modern bird. Taylor actually lives just outside of
###758 Post, Texas where the fossil was found, and I've actually excavated in those
###762 triassic redbeds, with Taylor.  When Taylor saw the fossil, he said to
###766 Chatterjee "You know, the unbiased person would say that looks just like a
###770 blackbird." To which Chaterjee agreed! The only reason protoavis is
###776 "controversial" is because the rock layers in which it was found are "too old" for
###783 birds. As for the Horton bluff fossil trackways,
###786 you are grossly in error.  The original claims described the track maker as a
###790 crocodile-like creature, the Nova Scotia Museum website claims they were made
###794 by an amphibian, and in a 2004 GSA paper, Lucas Spencer described the
###799 interpretation of the tracks as "embarassingly bad blunder."  He then
###804 went on to make his own embarrassing remarks and claimed the tracks were
###807 probably made by fish fins!  I've personally studied and mapped out the trail.  The
###814 tracks were clearly made by a bipedal animal with two large toes, a big claw off
###820 the tip of the larger toe, and no tail drag evidence anywhere. I compared those
###825 footprints to actual ostrich tracks at an ostrich ranch in Alberta, and they are a
###829 dead ringer, complete with a claw impression off the tip of the larger toe.
###834 Interestingly, the famous Canadian geologist, William Logan, found fossil bird
###838 tracks in that immediate area, in 1841. Sternberg mentioned these tracks in more
###843 detail in a GSA bulletin in 1933, and said the tracks "superficially ... resemble the
###851 tracks of some of the wading birds, but of course there is little probability of their
###856 having been made by birds."  Because as we all know, they can't be bird tracks,
###863 because birds had not yet evolved in the carboniferous, right?
###912 CircusOfPrecision got into a lengthy debate with several youtubers, making
###917 numerous, significant points. I hope you don't mind my calling you "precision" for
###921 short. It was clear that precision had a pretty wide range of knowledge, and I was
###925 pretty impressed with their patience as they tried to explain their points to people
###929 who did not want to understand. In response to claims that somehow letters
###934 in the DNA were information, precision wrote:
###964 You are right on the money Precision. Letters do not equal information, letters
###969 convey information.  You need more than letters - you need someone to assemble
###975 the letters into information, a system for conveying the information, a system for
###980 reading the information and a system for using the information, as precision
###984 pointed out, based upon predetermined, arbitrary rules.  A simile would be
###989 someone speaking Arabic to someone who speaks and understands only english
###993 - loads of information there, but they are operating on different rules to convey
###997 information, and the information is lost, and unusable because of the system
###1003 breakdown. The incredible systems involved in life
###1006 that use the information in the DNA are staggering in their complexity, and
###1010 necessary to read the information in the DNA.  But the information on how to build
###1015 those systems, necessary to read information in the DNA, comes from the
###1018 information conveyed by the DNA!  It's a codependent system.  As we can see in
###1023 the comments left against Precision by those who refused to understand, one
###1028 can truly say that there is none so blind as those who will not see.  The comments
###1034 were just as shocking to follow as the story of Jesus healing the blind man from
###1038 birth, and the reaction of those who did not want to believe in Christ. You can see
###1043 why Jesus said "For judgment I am come into this world, that they which see not
###1048 might see; and that they which see might be made blind."
###1054 Precision, I don't know who you are, but for your valiant efforts in the intellectual
###1058 battle, I salute you.
