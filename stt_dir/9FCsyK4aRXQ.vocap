###13 My story begins in Zimbabwe
###16 with a brave park ranger named Orpheus
###19 and an injured buffalo.
###22 And Orpheus looked at the buffalo on the ground, and he looked at me,
###26 and as our eyes met, there was an unspoken grief between the three of us.
###31 She was a beautifully wild and innocent creature,
###35 and Orpheus lifted the muzzle of his rifle to her ear. (Gunshot)
###42 And at that moment, she started to give birth.
###46 As life slipped from the premature calf, we examined the injuries.
###51 Her back leg had been caught in an eight-strand wire snare.
###55 She'd fought for freedom [for] so hard and so long
###58 that she'd ripped her pelvis in half.
###62 Well, she was finally free.
###65 Ladies and gentlemen, today I feel a great sense of responsibility
###69 in speaking to you on behalf of those that never could.
###74 Their suffering is my grief, is my motivation.
###80 Martin Luther King best summarises my call to arms here today.
###85 He said, "There comes a time when one must take a position that's neither safe,
###89 nor politic, nor popular.
###92 But he must take that position because his conscience tells him that it's right."
###98 Because his conscience tells him it is right.
###103 At the end of this talk I'm gonna ask you all a question.
###106 That question is the only reason I traveled here today
###108 all the way from the African savanna.
###111 That question for me has cleansed my soul.
###114 How you answer that question will always be yours.
###119 I remember watching the movie The Wizard of Oz as a young kid,
###122 and I was never scared of the witch or the flying monkeys.
###126 My greatest fear was that I'd grow up like the Lion, without courage.
###131 And I grew up always asking myself if I thought I'd be brave?
###135 Well, years after Dorothy had made her way back to Kansas,
###139 and the Lion had found his courage,
###141 I walked into a tattoo parlor and had the words
###143 'Seek and Destroy' tattooed across my chest.
###147 And I thought that'd make me big and brave.
###150 But it'd take me almost a decade to grow into those words.
###153 By the age of 20 I'd become a clearance diver in the navy.
###157 By 25, as a special operations sniper,
###160 I knew exactly how many clicks of elevation I needed on the scope of my rifle
###164 to take a headshot on a moving target from 700m away.
###168 I knew exactly how many grams of high explosives it takes
###171 to blast through a steel plate door from only a few meters away,
###174 without blowing myself, or my team, up behind me.
###177 And I knew that Baghdad was a shitty place, and when things go bang,
###182 well, people die.
###184 Now back then, I'd no idea what a conservationist did,
###187 other than hug trees and piss off large corporations. (Laughter)
###191 I knew they had dreadlocks. I knew they smoked dope. (Laughter)
###196 I didn't really give a shit about the environment, and why should I?
###199 I was the idiot that used to speed up in his car just trying to hit birds on the road.
###204 My life was a world away from conservation.
###207 I'd just spent nine years doing things in real life
###209 most people wouldn't dream of trying on a Playstation.
###214 Well, after 12 tours to Iraq as a so-called 'mercenary', the skills I had were good for one thing:
###220 I was programmed to destroy.
###224 Looking back now, on everything I've done, and the places I've been,
###229 in my heart, I've only ever performed one true act of bravery.
###234 And that was a simple choice of deciding 'Yes' or deciding 'No'.
###238 But it was that one act which defines me completely
###241 and ensures there'll never be separation between who I am, and what I do.
###247 When I finally left Iraq behind me I was lost.
###249 Yeah I felt – ahh – I just had no idea where I was going in life
###252 or where I was meant to be and I arrived in Africa at the beginning of 2009.
###256 I was aged 29 at the time.
###259 Somehow, I always knew I'd find a purpose amongst chaos,
###262 and that's exactly what happened.
###264 I'd no idea though, I'd find it in a remote part of the Zimbabwe bush.
###269 And we were patrolling along, and the vultures circled in the air
###272 and as we got closer the stench of death hung there, in the air like a thick, dark veil,
###278 and sucked the oxygen out of your lungs.
###281 And as we got closer, there was a great bull elephant,
###285 resting on its side, with its face cut away.
###289 And the world around me stopped.
###293 I was consumed by a deep and overwhelming sadness.
###296 Seeing innocent creatures killed like this hit me in a way like nothing before.
###300 I'd actually poached as a teenager and they're memories I'll take to the grave.
###304 Time had changed me though; something inside wasn't the same.
###309 And it's never gonna be again.
###313 I asked myself, "Does that elephant need its face
###318 more than some guy in Asia needs a tusk on his desk?"
###321 Well of course it bloody does, that was irrelevant.
###325 All that mattered there and then was:
###327 Would I be brave enough to give up everything in my life
###330 to try and stop the suffering of animals?
###332 This was the one true defining moment of my life:
###335 Yes or no?
###338 I contacted my family the next day and began selling all my houses.
###342 These are assets a well-advised mercenary quickly acquires with the proceeds of war.
###346 My life-savings have since been used to found and grow
###350 the International Anti-Poaching Foundation.
###353 The IAPF is a direct-action, law enforcement organization.
###357 From drone technology, to an international qualification for rangers,
###361 we're battling each and every day to bring military solutions
###364 to conservation's thin green line.
###368 Now my story may be slightly unique,
###371 but I'm not going to use it to talk to you today about the organization I run --
###375 in what probably could have been a pretty good fundraiser.
###378 (Laughter) (Applause)
###386 Remember, today is about the question I'm gonna ask you at the end.
###392 Because it's impossible for me to get up here and talk about just saving wildlife
###396 when I know the problem of animal welfare is much broader throughout society.
###403 A few years after I saw that elephant I woke up very early one morning.
###407 I already knew the answer to the question I was about to ask myself,
###410 but it was the first time I'd put it into words:
###415 Does a cow value its life more than I enjoy a barbecue?
###424 See, I'd been guilty all this time of what's termed 'speciesism'.
###428 Speciesism is very much the same as racism or sexism.
###432 It involves the allocation of a different set of values,
###435 rights or special considerations to individuals,
###438 based solely on who or what they are.
###441 The realisation of the flexible morality
###443 I'd used to suit my everyday conveniences made me sick in the stomach.
###447 See, I'd loved blaming parts of Asia for their insatiable demand for ivory and rhino horn,
###452 and the way the region's booming economic growth
###455 is dramatically increasing the illegal wildlife trade.
###459 When I woke up that morning though I realised,
###461 even though I'd dedicated my life to saving animals,
###465 in my mind I was no better than a poacher,
###467 or the guy in Asia with a tusk on his desk.
###471 As this 'over-consumptive meat-eater' I'd referred to some animals as 'beasts'.
###479 When in reality I'd been the beast: destructively obedient,
###484 a slave to my habits, a cold shoulder to my conscience.
###490 We've all had contact with pets or other animals in our lives.
###493 We can't deny our understanding of the feelings that each animal has.
###497 The ability to suffer pain or loneliness.
###499 And to fear.
###502 Like us also, each animal has the ability to express contentment,
###506 to build family structures, and want of satisfying basic instincts and desires.
###511 For many of us though,
###514 that's as far as we allow our imagination to explore
###516 before the truth inconveniences our habits.
###521 The disconnect that exists between consuming a product
###523 and the reality it takes to bring that product to market is a phenomenon to itself.
###527 Animals are treated like commodities and referred to as property.
###530 We call it 'murder' to kill a human being yet create legal and illegal industries
###535 out of what would be regarded as torture if humans were involved.
###538 And we pay people to do things to animals that none of us would engage in personally.
###544 Just because we don't see it up close does not mean we're not responsible.
###549 Peter Singer, the man who popularised the term 'speciesism' wrote,
###553 "Although there may be differences between animals and humans
###557 they each share the ability to suffer.
###560 And we must give equal consideration to that suffering.
###565 Any position that allows similar cases to be treated in a dissimilar fashion
###569 fails to qualify as an acceptable moral theory."
###574 Around the world this year 65 billion animals will be killed in factory farms.
###580 How many animals' lives is one human's life worth?
###584 A meat-eater in this room will consume, on average, 8,000 animals in their lifetime.
###590 Ocean pollution, global warming and deforestation
###593 are driving us towards the next great mass-extinction
###596 and the meat industry is the greatest negative factor in all of these phenomena.
###602 The illegal traffic in wildlife now ranks as one of the largest criminal industries in the world --
###606 it's up there with drugs, guns and human trafficking.
###609 The ability to stop this devastation
###611 lies in the willingness of an international community
###613 to step in and preserve a dying global treasure.
###618 Experimentation on animals –
###621 If animals are so like us that we can substitute using them instead of humans
###624 then surely they have the very same attributes
###627 that mean they deserve to be protected from harm?
###632 Whether we're talking about factory farming, live export, poaching, the fur trade,
###637 logically, it's all on the same playing field to me.
###641 Suffering is suffering,
###643 and murder is murder.
###645 And the more helpless the victim,
###647 the more horrific the crime.
###650 Next time you think an animal lover is too emotional,
###654 too passionate, or even a little crazy, please remember
###657 we see things through a different lens.
###662 So in a few days, my son's gonna be born.
###666 I find myself wondering, "What kind of world is he entering?"
###670 Are we gonna be the generation that defines our failure as a species?
###675 I believe our generation will be judged
###677 by our moral courage to protect what's right.
###681 And that every worthwhile action requires a level of sacrifice.
###686 Well, I now offer myself, without reservation, to animals.
###690 And when I strip away all the material belongings around me,
###695 I see that I too, am an animal.
###698 We're family. Together on one planet.
###703 And of the five million species on that planet,
###705 only one has the power to determine what level of suffering is acceptable
###709 for all other sentient beings to endure.
###713 Whether it's eating less meat,
###715 contributing to the fight against poaching or speaking up for the voiceless,
###719 we all have choices.
###720 And small changes in our lives mean big changes in others' [lives].
###726 So now back to the beginning.
###728 My reason for being here is my question for you:
###732 next time you have an opportunity to make a difference for animals,
###736 will you be brave enough?
###738 Yes or no?
###740 Thank you very much.
###741 (Applause)
