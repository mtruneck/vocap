###27 JON KESSLER: I had a friend in undergrad who grew up on North
###30 7th Street.
###31 He was Polish-American.
###32 I was in the East Village for six months in a
###35 tiny, crappy apartment.
###37 He just said, you should really check out the first
###40 stop on the L train.
###41 And I'd never been out here before.
###43 And came out, drew a circle on the map around the Bedford
###47 Avenue stop.
###48 And that day, I found about six or seven places.
###51 And I moved into this building where I paid $150 a month for
###55 the whole building, and I got a 10-year lease.
###58 MALE SPEAKER: What year was that?
###59 JON KESSLER: That was 1980.
###62 I had that moment in my life which I'd wanted, which was
###68 the older generation had had it in Tribeca and in Soho,
###71 where you just go to a factory building, and the landlord
###75 just could not imagine that you'd want to live in an
###78 abandoned factory.
###79 And this neighborhood was so desolate at night.
###81 And he was just happy to have someone
###84 looking over his factory.
###85 It really seemed far away back then.
###87 I mean, I would tell people I was going to Manhattan.
###89 They'd say, you going to the city?
###90 This is only 27 years ago, but it really
###93 was a different mindset.
###95 This is a photograph--
###97 which I didn't take, it actually was given to me-- of
###101 a flower arrangement from Japan of quite a well-known
###105 arranger, Sofu Teshigahara.
###109 And this will be motorized and mechanized.
###112 And so the motor here will be moving these panels slowly, so
###116 it actually deconstructs and looks like that a lot.
###121 But these are constantly shifting.
###122 And there is one moment when it registers, and
###124 it looks like that.
###125 
###130 And I've used motors and lights principally since I
###134 started showing in 1983 at Artist's Space.
###137 It was my first show.
###139 
###141 The work always did have a relationship to what was
###145 mechanically creating a representation.
###148 Sometimes that representation would be projected onto a
###151 screen, sometimes a representation would just be
###154 the performance itself that would sort of flatten out.
###160 I learned how to do all the stuff I was doing just from
###162 the store owners on Canal Street.
###164 They were so generous, and I didn't know really how to wire
###169 up a light bulb.
###170 And I'd go in there, and it was pretty desolate back then,
###174 Canal Street.
###176 It wasn't the pirated CD, Louis Vuitton, Gucci industry
###182 that it is now.
###183 It was just kind of a sleepy, industrial, surplus
###187 neighborhood.
###187 And I'd go in there, and buy the owners a beer.
###191 And they'd sit down with me and draw up diagrams.
###194 That's how I really learned how to make what I'm making.
###197 That was my school.
###198 
###203 This space had been abandoned for 20
###205 years, so it was a wreck.
###206 It was really a wreck.
###207 I lived without a toilet for almost six months, and I had a
###211 wood burning stove.
###213 So I used to go out with my truck, and collecting wood
###216 pallets, bringing them home, chopping them up with a
###220 chainsaw, and sticking them in the wood stove.
###223 
###227 With Planet Thailand, they started in Green Point, and
###231 then they opened a small little
###233 restaurant on Bedford Avenue.
###234 And then they opened this big place.
###235 And when they did, they asked me to design the fountain.
###238 MALE SPEAKER: How'd they know you?
###239 JON KESSLER: They actually knew me through my friend
###241 Julius, who was the general contractor on this job.
###245 And they didn't know me.
###247 They just basically said they wanted a fountain.
###249 And Julius said, you got to look at my friend Jon's work.
###252 So that's how it happened.
###254 The idea was to make a fountain with a boat.
###258 I was determined to do it without a motor.
###260 So I guess starting with the idea of maybe a rowboat, I
###264 happened to have found a large boat which
###266 had two sets of oars.
###269 And then the symmetry of the fore-oars
###271 sort of found itself.
###272 And then I used the principle of a Japanese--
###276 this is quite common in a Japanese garden, which would
###279 be a bamboo cup which would fill up with water.
###283 And then the weight of the water would tip the cup over.
###287 And it would make a knocking sound.
###289 Just a sort of typical Japanese idea of just the
###292 small sound.
###293 You're aware of it.
###295 It keeps time.
###296 And so when the cups fill up, actually the oars move.
###300 And then when the cups release the water, the
###302 oars move back down.
###303 So it's a constant moving piece.
###306 The last element was the duck, which is actually a taxidermy
###310 duck that-- oh, my god, this is such a crazy trip, going to
###313 a taxidermist in the Bronx.
###316 I found him in the Yellow Pages.
###318 And I go back there, and it was mostly rats.
###321 He had mostly taxidermy rats, and then this one duck.
###324 I called him on the phone, he said he had a duck.
###325 And I go there.
###326 And then I put a life preserver on him.
###328 And he's wearing a little sailor cap, and
###330 he's walking the plank.
###331 
###335 MALE SPEAKER: You ever get mugged on this street?
###336 JON KESSLER: Yeah.
###337 I wasn't mugged, but I had a knife to my throat, right at
###343 my driveway.
###344 And it turns out the guy puts a knife to my throat.
###351 And he was the guy from Joe's Busy Corner.
###355 The girls--
###356 slice him up, Jimmie!
###357 Slice him up!
###359 And I'm like, I got a knife here.
###360 And I'm like, you're the guy from Joe's Busy Corner!
###362 
###367 They could have slit my throat.
###370 And no one would have found me here for a few days.
###373 
###381 
###385 It wasn't until after 9/11, really, that the work changed
###389 with the use of video.
###391 And I had in mind a piece which was in the PS1 show
###396 called "One Hour Photo." Just really, I couldn't get the
###399 image of the cockpit, what the terrorists saw on 9/11, I
###402 couldn't get it out of my head.
###403 And I decided to actually create it.
###405 I used a surveillance camera in order to make that scene
###408 come to life using postcards of the World Trade Center.
###412 And that's when the work really
###414 shifted and took a turn.
###416 And all of a sudden I had this duality between the mechanisms
###420 and the monitors.
###422 And that's when the work got a new life, I would say, like a
###426 new pair of legs.
###428 
###436 The research that I did for the show I feel like wasn't
###439 really anything special, having lived in America in the
###443 last four years, that we are all sort of experiencing
###447 day-to-day all the lies and all the deceit, and the shock
###451 at things like, well, Bush winning the first time around,
###454 and then Bush winning again the second time around.
###457 It was an incredible disappointment
###460 and shock to me.
###462 
###466 I think the show does encapsulate a certain amount
###468 of rage that I have, and disappointment, but also a
###472 certain alienation that I have, the country in some ways
###475 being stolen from me, and that the Constitution was being
###479 stolen from us.
###480 And that in a funny way, had you told me that I'd be making
###486 this show four years ago, I wouldn't have believed you.
###488 And I feel in some ways I'm sort of like Michael Douglas
###491 in "Falling Down," or Henry Fonda in "The Wrong Man," or
###494 something, being pushed, pushed,
###496 pushed, until this happens.
###498 And I'm just reacting to what's coming upon me.
###503 
###509 It was almost like a diary, just like me processing all of
###514 that information, all of that day-to-day existence in
###518 America, from 9/11 to the buildup of the war, to the
###522 Hurricane Katrina, to lots of
###524 connections that were happening.
###526 And coming to the studio, and really sort of for the first
###529 time maybe in a very long time where I was just working very,
###534 very intuitively, very immediately, and very, very
###538 quickly, actually.
###538 And then not even processing it so much.
###544 Really just consciously sort of knowing that as I was
###550 working, I was getting my confidence back, and my
###552 intuition was being restored, and I was just
###555 going to let it flow.
###556 And that's what I did.
###558 
###564 Toys have been something that's been very consistent in
###566 my work since the beginning.
###568 I think of the necessity in this work to play.
###572 It doesn't come off didactic.
###574 And there's a level of play that disarms the viewer.
###578 And then you can, on top of that, lay on
###582 any content you want.
###583 And I think there's a certain power in the
###587 simplicity of the mechanism.
###588 But then the image that you see on the screen is actually
###591 quite sophisticated.
###592 
###603 I wanted people to be suspicious of the images that
###606 they're getting.
###607 I think you have to constantly be questioning how those
###610 images are coming at you, why they're coming at you,
###613 connecting the dots back to what the media, in some ways,
###618 is constructing for you.
###619 And these pieces are all there.
###622 There's not a single thing in that show that is not in the
###624 room if you have the energy and the will
###626 to deconstruct it.
###628 
###637 When I'm working on a show, I don't know--
###640 especially one of these big shows, like the show I'm
###642 planning, in scope is going to be a very ambitious project
###648 like the "Palace At 4 AM." And I don't know what it's going
###651 to be like before I start.
###652 And I really do feel like I'm finding my way in the dark,
###657 and just gathering evidence, and gathering forensic
###662 information, bits and pieces, like after the bombing, in
###665 order to put it back together, the scene of the crime.
###670 The show is called "10:10--
###671 The Time Was Now." And there's going to be photographs I'm
###675 working on.
###676 There's going to be sculptural installations.
###678 There's going to be lots of monitors all over the room.
###681 So it's very, very crowded.
###682 These are very large.
###683 These are these paper pulp pieces I'm working on.
###688 These will be covering the walls of suicide bombers.
###692 Then you walk in, and it's sort of all about time.
###695 Here's the time.
###695 It's 10:09.
###696 This is like a minute before the moment of detonation.
###700 These will just be covering the walls.
###702 MALE SPEAKER: They're all 10:10.
###703 JON KESSLER: They're all, you know, 10:08, 10:09.
###706 And it's really how the advertisers choose to portray
###711 the watch face, because it's kind of like
###713 a happy face, right?
###714 And it still shows the logo.
###715 So I'm just taking advantage of that fact, and sampling,
###719 and using that, and stealing the watch ads for my show.
###723 
###726 The whole center of the show is going to be sort of like
###729 the atrocity exhibition of using figurines, mostly
###733 soldiers, to create these events.
###738 And here is one where the soldier's just
###742 covered in crude oil.
###745 There's the one that you saw where he's being
###749 dragged along the floor.
###752 And I've just started to compose these.
###755 
###759 And then there's this guy.
###760 He's an aging hippie waking up sort of on the beaches of
###764 California, sun tanned, and the long, gray hair, maybe
###769 with a bottle of Ripple in his hand.
###771 And then he morphed into a kind of much more complicated,
###778 political character.
###779 He figured very prominently in the "Palace At 4 AM." And he
###783 became a piece called "Evolution," where he became a
###786 right wing senator.
###786 And he was on a blog site kissing the troops in Baghdad,
###790 and waking up in the burning embers of
###792 the World Trade Center.
###793 But now he's really sort of turned into just everything.
###798 He's the mash-up.
###800 I collide him with all the characters
###802 that I'm working with.
###803 But his voice is gone.
###805 He's trying to speak, trying to communicate.
###807 And all of those sounds, those motor sounds, those server
###810 motors are actually going to be picked up with little
###813 microphones that are on his face, and they're going to be
###817 coming through the sound system.
###818 So it'll be loud.
###819 It'll be sort of a loud, worrying,
###820 whizzing, motor sound.
###824 I'm not glorifying this.
###825 But I really want there to be this feeling when you walk
###828 into this show that death is imminent, or that it's somehow
###832 suspended in that moment just before death in order to make
###836 you feel completely alive.
###839 So the work, you can see, has changed a lot.
###843 Flowers and beauty.
###845 Although I think the work is quite beautiful still.
