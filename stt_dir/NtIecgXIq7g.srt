1
0:0:0,293 --> 0:0:3,933
Oh my god that girl is so hot


2
0:0:3,933 --> 0:0:8,589
SHUT UP!


3
0:0:8,589 --> 0:0:11,325
Heey dude, check out my new girlfriend, Erin.


4
0:0:11,325 --> 0:0:12,98
Erin, Anthony


5
0:0:12,98 --> 0:0:14,261
Hi


6
0:0:14,261 --> 0:0:17,655
This... is your girlfriend?


7
0:0:17,655 --> 0:0:19,198
But she's hot


8
0:0:19,198 --> 0:0:21,249
What, you are saying I can't get a hot girlfriend?


9
0:0:21,249 --> 0:0:22,656
Euuh, yah!


10
0:0:22,656 --> 0:0:23,261
Look at you.


11
0:0:23,261 --> 0:0:25,667
Well, obviously I can.


12
0:0:25,667 --> 0:0:27,682
Anyway, what do you want for Christmas?


13
0:0:27,682 --> 0:0:30,712
Nothing


14
0:0:30,712 --> 0:0:32,259
You don't want anything for Christmas?


15
0:0:32,259 --> 0:0:33,884
Nope


16
0:0:33,884 --> 0:0:35,291
Dear diary


17
0:0:35,291 --> 0:0:39,165
I know anthony wants something for Christmas this year.


18
0:0:39,165 --> 0:0:41,57
Last year he said he didn't care...


19
0:0:41,57 --> 0:0:44,557
and then he got super pissed at me when I didn't get him anything.


20
0:0:44,557 --> 0:0:50,338
Looks like I have to do some old school investigating to find out
what he really wants!


21
0:0:50,338 --> 0:0:52,18
Yo Anthony


22
0:0:52,18 --> 0:0:54,212
So I got this friend who is a lot like you


23
0:0:54,212 --> 0:0:56,0
And he wants me to get him something for Christmas


24
0:0:56,0 --> 0:0:57,996
So, what do you think I should get him?


25
0:0:57,996 --> 0:0:59,9
Well, what's his name?


26
0:0:59,9 --> 0:1:3,477
Anthon...lee, Anthonlee.


27
0:1:3,477 --> 0:1:4,664
He's chinese


28
0:1:4,664 --> 0:1:8,29
I don't want anything for Christmas, Ok?


29
0:1:8,29 --> 0:1:11,401
HOW THE HELL DID HE KNOW MY MOTIVE?!


30
0:1:11,401 --> 0:1:13,917
He's smarter then I thaught.


31
0:1:13,917 --> 0:1:19,929
Looks like I need more, coverts methods.


32
0:1:19,929 --> 0:1:23,951
Tell me what you want for Christmas, or I'll blow your F******
 brains out!


33
0:1:23,951 --> 0:1:28,726
I couldn't get an answer out of Anthony before he suffered a
 minor heart attack.


34
0:1:28,726 --> 0:1:33,119
I should probably pay him a visit in the hospital...


35
0:1:33,119 --> 0:1:34,93
Heey


36
0:1:34,93 --> 0:1:36,149
Heey!


37
0:1:36,149 --> 0:1:38,279
Your the first person to come see me!


38
0:1:38,279 --> 0:1:42,632
Here's some flowers.


39
0:1:42,632 --> 0:1:43,476
Hah!


40
0:1:43,476 --> 0:1:49,209
Anthony totally took the bait, he doesn't even know I put a
camera in the flower pot!


41
0:1:49,209 --> 0:1:51,506
He's stupider then I thaught!


42
0:1:51,506 --> 0:1:53,53
HAHAHA!


43
0:1:53,53 --> 0:1:53,585
What?!


44
0:1:53,585 --> 0:1:56,303
What's Erin doing there?


45
0:1:56,303 --> 0:1:58,303
NO,NO, WHAT ARE YOU DOING WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!


46
0:1:58,303 --> 0:2:10,902

47
0:2:10,902 --> 0:2:12,27

0:2:12,27 --> 0:2:19,823
Anthony is so gay for making out with Erin, Im gonna, whooaht?


49
0:2:19,823 --> 0:2:22,276

51
0:2:25,755 --> 0:2:26,926

0:2:30,287 --> 0:2:31,473

54
0:2:31,473 --> 0:2:36,774
Well, we might have done a little more then making out...


55
0:2:36,774 --> 0:2:38,223
Ah, whatever.


56
0:2:38,223 --> 0:2:39,755
We weren't actually dating.


57
0:2:39,755 --> 0:2:42,524
I was just paying him so he could pose as my girlfriend.


58
0:2:42,524 --> 0:2:43,38
Wait, what?


59
0:2:43,38 --> 0:2:45,926
Well, how else am I supposed to impress people?


60
0:2:45,926 --> 0:2:47,616
No, no, you said.. you said him?


61
0:2:47,616 --> 0:2:50,523
Euh, yah.
 Erin's a dude.


62
0:2:50,523 --> 0:2:52,676
I can't afford a real woman!


63
0:2:52,676 --> 0:2:57,253
But... I did things with her.


64
0:2:57,253 --> 0:3:0,425

65
0:3:0,425 --> 0:3:14,96

0:3:21,649 --> 0:3:23,69
Merry Christmas!


68
0:3:23,69 --> 0:3:26,581
Sorry about those STD's, but I brought you a little present to cheer
 you up!


69
0:3:26,581 --> 0:3:33,86
I didn't know what is was supposed to get you, so I just went with
 something save.


70
0:3:33,86 --> 0:3:35,655

71
0:3:35,655 --> 0:3:37,827
