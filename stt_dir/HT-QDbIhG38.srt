CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: There are loud cars,
there are quiet cars. People are saying, some


2
0:0:5,21 --> 0:0:9,75
cars are too quiet, and now the governments
getting involved. I`m Carl Azuz. We are hitting


3
0:0:9,75 --> 0:0:14,469
the gas on the new edition of CNN STUDENT
NEWS.


4
0:0:14,469 --> 0:0:31,3
Newtown, Connecticut, Aurora, Colorado, Tucson,
Arizona - when a mass shooting happens like


5
0:0:31,3 --> 0:0:36,9
we`ve seen in those cities, the issue of gun
control often comes up. President Obama has


6
0:0:36,9 --> 0:0:40,95
said he wants to take action on this, he`s
put Vice President Joe Biden in charge of


7
0:0:40,95 --> 0:0:46,21
coming up with ideas on how to reduce gun
violence. Vice President Biden`s task force


8
0:0:46,21 --> 0:0:50,88
is getting input from people with many different
view points. Yesterday, I`ve met with gun


9
0:0:50,88 --> 0:0:55,13
safety organizations and victims from some
of these shootings. Now, they are pushing


10
0:0:55,13 --> 0:1:0,29
for stricter gun control. Today, the task
force is set to meet with representatives


11
0:1:0,29 --> 0:1:5,56
from groups that support gun rights, like
the National Rifle Association. That organization


12
0:1:5,56 --> 0:1:9,749
says it`s committed to protecting people,
but it thinks stricter gun laws aren`t the


13
0:1:9,749 --> 0:1:14,759
best way to do that. Retail stores that sell
guns are also going to be involved in these


14
0:1:14,759 --> 0:1:19,59
meetings. President Obama said he wants some
concrete proposals from the task force by


15
0:1:19,59 --> 0:1:21,299
the end of this month.


16
0:1:21,299 --> 0:1:27,529
2012 is in the books, and it`s in the record
books, too. Last year is officially the hottest


17
0:1:27,529 --> 0:1:32,749
year ever for the United States. It was also
the second worst for extreme weather: things


18
0:1:32,749 --> 0:1:38,31
like hurricanes, droughts or floods. The average
temperature across the lower 48 states was


19
0:1:38,31 --> 0:1:44,939
55.3 degrees. That beat the old record by
a full degree. Scientists say that when things


20
0:1:44,939 --> 0:1:50,549
get warmer, it raises the chances for extreme
weather. All 48 of those states had above


21
0:1:50,549 --> 0:1:53,709
average temperatures last year, but some set
their own superlatives.

you don`t feel good.

CHAD MYERS, AMS METEOROLOGIST: The warmest
year on record for the United States. Every


25
0:1:59,27 --> 0:2:5,369
here, every spot here in the red, a new record
for the hottest event for any year ever recorded.


26
0:2:5,369 --> 0:2:12,15
And July, 2012 was the hottest year on record
of any month we`ve ever recorded since we`ve


27
0:2:12,15 --> 0:2:12,48
been here.


28
0:2:12,48 --> 0:2:13,6
(END VIDEO CLIP)


29
0:2:13,6 --> 0:2:17,97
AZUZ: In many U.S. States state legislatures
are back in session this week and next. They`ve


30
0:2:17,97 --> 0:2:21,79
got different names in different states. They
may be called the state house and senate.


31
0:2:21,79 --> 0:2:26,47
The legislative assembly, the general assembly,
but basically, they are meeting of people


32
0:2:26,47 --> 0:2:29,23
elected by the states citizens to make laws.


33
0:2:29,23 --> 0:2:34,25
All right, cool, so what - well, a lot of
the things that affect you every day are determined


34
0:2:34,25 --> 0:2:39,51
by state legislatures. They make laws about
your schools and the requirements for graduation.


35
0:2:39,51 --> 0:2:45,25
They decide who can drive and when, they ensure
roads are taken care of and safe. They operate


36
0:2:45,25 --> 0:2:50,6
states courts and they decide how much tax
you pay when you go out to eat or you buy


37
0:2:50,6 --> 0:2:54,8
clothes. These are all responsibilities of
the state, so while we spend a lot of time


38
0:2:54,8 --> 0:2:59,72
talking about the U.S. Congress on CNN STUDENT
NEWS, we want you to keep in mind that your


39
0:2:59,72 --> 0:3:3,92
state law makers pass laws that effect you
as well. It`s part of what`s called "federalism."


40
0:3:3,92 --> 0:3:9,29
It`s a system of government where the same
place is controlled by two different authorities,


41
0:3:9,29 --> 0:3:14,3
so in this case that would be your state government
and the U.S. Federal Government. Each of the


42
0:3:14,3 --> 0:3:18,9
50 states has a governor he or she represents
the states executive branch. Your state courts


43
0:3:18,9 --> 0:3:23,3
are the states judicial branch and the state
legislatures we just talked about make up


44
0:3:23,3 --> 0:3:25,13
your states legislative branch.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: See if you can I.D. me.
I`m a South American country that`s home to


47
0:3:33,51 --> 0:3:40,9
about 28 million people. I border the Caribbean
Sea, Colombia and Brazil. I`m one of the world`s


48
0:3:40,9 --> 0:3:51,24
largest exporters of oil. My president is
Hugo Chavez. I`m Venezuela. And President


49
0:3:51,24 --> 0:3:55,59
Chavez has been in charge of my government
for nearly 14 years.


50
0:3:55,59 --> 0:3:57,3
(END VIDEO CLIP)


51
0:3:57,3 --> 0:4:2,459
AZUZ: Hugo Chavez is supposed to stay in charge
of Venezuela`s government for the next six


52
0:4:2,459 --> 0:4:6,959
years. He was reelected to a new term last
year. The country`s constitution says his


53
0:4:6,959 --> 0:4:13,5
inauguration is today, on January Tenth. There`s
a problem, though, Chavez won`t be there.


54
0:4:13,5 --> 0:4:17,299
The Venezuelan president has been in Cuba
for the past month or so, he`s being treated


55
0:4:17,299 --> 0:4:22,99
there for cancer. There was some concern in
Venezuela about what might happen if Chavez


56
0:4:22,99 --> 0:4:26,639
missed the inauguration. The Constitution
there says that if a leader is permanently


57
0:4:26,639 --> 0:4:31,919
absent, there would have to be new elections.
That`s not going to happen. Yesterday Venezuela`s


58
0:4:31,919 --> 0:4:37,9
Supreme Court ruled that President Chavez
will start his new term today even if he`s


59
0:4:37,9 --> 0:4:38,11
not sworn in.

63
0:4:47,219 --> 0:4:52,639
What U.S. State is home to the National Baseball
Hall of Fame? You know what to do, is it in


64
0:4:52,639 --> 0:5:2,96
New York, Ohio, Texas or California? You`ve
got three seconds, go!


65
0:5:2,96 --> 0:5:10,83
Baseball`s Hall of Fame is in Cooperstown.
So if you said New York, you hit out the park.


66
0:5:10,83 --> 0:5:14,36
That`s your answer and that`s your shoutout.


67
0:5:14,36 --> 0:5:16,699
(END VIDEO CLIP)


68
0:5:16,699 --> 0:5:21,93
AZUZ: That Hall of Fame isn`t getting any
new members this year: there were 37 players


69
0:5:21,93 --> 0:5:27,749
eligible to get into Cooperstown on the 2013
ballot. But when the votes came in, no one


70
0:5:27,749 --> 0:5:32,37
was elected to the Hall of Fame. This isn`t
that unusual, it has happened before seven


71
0:5:32,37 --> 0:5:37,99
other times since the Hall of Fame voting
started in 1936. What`s really interesting


72
0:5:37,99 --> 0:5:41,9
about this, this time around is that some
of the players who were eligible for the first


73
0:5:41,9 --> 0:5:46,86
time have been accused of using performance
enhancing drugs. That includes all time home


74
0:5:46,86 --> 0:5:52,46
run king Barry Bonds, seven times Cy Young
winner Roger Clemens and Sammy Sosa, one of


75
0:5:52,46 --> 0:5:58,46
only eight players to hit more than 600 career
home runs. All three have denied using performance


76
0:5:58,46 --> 0:6:3,469
enhancing drugs. The Hall of Fame is voted
on by members of the Baseball Writers` Association


77
0:6:3,469 --> 0:6:8,439
of America. Players need to get support from
75 percent of the voters in order to get into


78
0:6:8,439 --> 0:6:14,259
Cooperstown. One voter said, this year`s results
are a statement on baseball`s so called "steroid


79
0:6:14,259 --> 0:6:19,339
era." He says the concerns about players who
were linked to steroids has hurt the Hall


80
0:6:19,339 --> 0:6:23,919
of Fame chances for some clean players as
well. This is an issue we are talking about


81
0:6:23,919 --> 0:6:29,779
in our blog. So, you are welcome to log on
to cnnstudent.com, to tell us your opinion.


82
0:6:29,779 --> 0:6:34,449
In 2010, Congress passed a law called the
Pedestrian Safety Enhancement Act, it laid


83
0:6:34,449 --> 0:6:38,969
out new rules for certain vehicles. The Department
of Transportation looked at a lot of factors


84
0:6:38,969 --> 0:6:43,77
including the extra costs for car companies,
now they are planning to put these rules in


85
0:6:43,77 --> 0:6:48,449
effect. So why is the government making noise
about cars that don`t make enough?


86
0:6:48,449 --> 0:6:49,499
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


87
0:6:49,499 --> 0:6:54,669
RENE MARSH, CNN CORRESPONDENT: They are green,
fuel efficient, but too quiet and a potential


88
0:6:54,669 --> 0:6:59,349
threat to cyclists and pedestrians. That`s
what the Department of Transportation says


89
0:6:59,349 --> 0:7:5,529
about hybrid and electric cars. The federal
agency just proposed rules that would require


90
0:7:5,529 --> 0:7:11,969
new green vehicles make sounds loud enough
to alert pedestrians and cyclists like George


91
0:7:11,969 --> 0:7:12,15
Abbot.


92
0:7:12,15 --> 0:7:14,939
GEORGE ABBOT, PEDESTRIAN, CYCLIST: I have
the experience going alongside them - and


93
0:7:14,939 --> 0:7:17,949
not, like not realizing that there was one
there.


94
0:7:17,949 --> 0:7:22,27
MARSH: It`s what`s under the hood that makes
this hybrid an electric car so quiet on the


95
0:7:22,27 --> 0:7:27,879
road. This Nissan Leaf also has technologies
similar to what the government wants in all


96
0:7:27,879 --> 0:7:33,249
electric and hybrid cars. Do you hear that
sound? Well, the government believes it could


97
0:7:33,249 --> 0:7:35,839
save lives.


98
0:7:35,839 --> 0:7:39,21
Eddie George sells the vehicles at Dart cars
in Maryland.


99
0:7:39,21 --> 0:7:43,559
EDDIR GEORGE, DARCARS NISSAN: The car is very
quiet, you cannot hear anything, so I mean


100
0:7:43,559 --> 0:7:47,8
you have some people when they are coming
to test drive the car, the car is on.


101
0:7:47,8 --> 0:7:52,93
MARSH: But a flip of a switch and its pedestrian
alert feature turns on. Without the feature,


102
0:7:52,93 --> 0:7:54,599
a much quieter drive.


103
0:7:54,599 --> 0:8:0,389
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I didn`t know that would
help, but I think, you know, again, I think


104
0:8:0,389 --> 0:8:1,979
people would just need to pay more attention.


105
0:8:1,979 --> 0:8:6,39
MARSH: DOT says the sounds would need to be
loud enough to still be heard despite other


106
0:8:6,39 --> 0:8:12,119
street and ambient noises when the vehicle
is traveling under 18 miles per hour.


107
0:8:12,119 --> 0:8:19,39
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration
estimates their proposal would mean 2800 fewer


108
0:8:19,39 --> 0:8:22,339
pedestrian and cyclist injuries per year.


109
0:8:22,339 --> 0:8:27,339
MARSH: You shouldn`t expect to hear blaring
sounds coming from these green cars, if this


110
0:8:27,339 --> 0:8:32,88
is enacted, it was a lot louder in our piece
because our mikes picked up the sound. Each


111
0:8:32,88 --> 0:8:37,41
company can pick their particular sound they
want their cars to make. For example, the


112
0:8:37,41 --> 0:8:42,15
vehicle we looked at, the Nissan Leaf, the
technology, it was developed with the help


113
0:8:42,15 --> 0:8:47,24
of students at some of the country`s schools
for the hearing impaired. Rene Marsh, CNN,


114

116
0:8:48,39 --> 0:8:54,72
AZUZ: All right, well, before we go, we`ve
got a beastly tail of mistaken identity: reports


117
0:8:54,72 --> 0:9:0,34
of a lion on the loose in Norfolk, Virginia,
might have given some residents paws - look


118
0:9:0,34 --> 0:9:4,95
at this thing, it`s kind of cute. There was
no need for concern, as you can see. The carousing


119
0:9:4,95 --> 0:9:10,37
cat was actually a dog. Easy to understand
the mix up, though. This labradoodle`s owner


120
0:9:10,37 --> 0:9:15,92
cuts his canine so that he resembles the local
university mascot - a lion. Still, police


121
0:9:15,92 --> 0:9:20,99
called the zoo just to make sure that cats
were in their cages. So it seems like this


122
0:9:20,99 --> 0:9:25,25
time the main event was just the king of the
concrete jungle. CNN STUDENT NEWS returns


123
0:9:25,25 --> 0:11:25,25
tomorrow. No lion about that, we look forward
to seeing you all then.
