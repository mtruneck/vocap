###0 SHANNON: All right.
###1 Welcome.
###2 Well today, I am pleased to introduce,
###5 on behalf of the Talks at Google program, author Gregory
###8 Orfalea.
###10 Greg was born and raised in Los Angeles
###12 and educated at Georgetown University
###14 and the University of Alaska.
###16 He is the author or editor of eight books-- I guess nine now,
###21 including "The Man Who Guarded the Bomb" and "Angelino Days."
###27 The recipient of many awards for his writing, Greg's "Angelino
###31 Days" won the 2010 Arab American Book Award
###34 and was named a finalist for the PEN USA Award in Creative
###38 Writing-- I'm sorry, Creative Nonfiction.
###41 He has taught at the Claremont Colleges, Georgetown
###44 University, and Westmont College.
###48 Greg is here today to talk about his most recent work, "Journey
###51 to the Sun, Junipero Serra's Dream and the Founding
###54 of California," an authoritative and incisive biography
###58 of the man who founded California's missions.
###62 Combining European and American history,
###66 his religious scholarship, geography, and anthropology,
###70 Greg masterfully recounts the story
###72 and brings new information to our knowledge
###75 of a man whose massive cultural project not only created
###78 the blueprint for modern California,
###81 but changed the future of our nation.
###83 Please join me in welcoming Greg Orfalea.
###85 [APPLAUSE]

###94 GREGORY ORFALEA: Thank you, Shannon.
###96 Who is God's companion?
###97 
###101 Junipero Serra might have contemplated this thought
###105 on the road in the Salinas Valley of California,
###110 where in 1771 he met an Indian woman who
###115 offered him "a present."
###119 When he asked her name, she murmured "Soledad," Spanish
###125 for "solitude."
###127 Or at least that's what he heard- "I was astonished,
###133 and turning to my companions said, 'Here, gentleman,
###136 you have Maria de la Soledad.'"
###140 He gave her glass beads for seeds; she nodded.
###146 As "the name stuck to the place,"
###150 Serra made a note to found a mission
###152 in that desolate, treeless spot.
###155 Soledad later became the hardest luck mission of them all.
###160 
###163 Serra had undergone plenty of solitude,
###168 the "soledad" of the trail, the one that surrounded
###172 your neck like water at night, a "soledad"
###177 to conquer by singing Matins at first light.
###182 Not English or American "soledad,"
###185 which celebrated being on one's own, without others;
###190 Spanish "soledad," which longed for them.
###193 
###196 Serra was not about "soledad"-- neither
###200 were the Franciscan fathers.
###203 He'd swallowed his fill of it as a boy,
###206 losing two sisters and a brother,
###209 working the quiet fields of Petra,
###213 his home village on the Spanish island of Mallorca.
###218 But his father's hand, that leather hand,
###222 was always on his shoulder, and later his confreres' abrazos;
###227 even though strangers in the confessional cut "soledad"
###232 with their pain.
###234 Serra respected solitude, the solitude Christ
###239 felt in the garden the last night of his life
###243 when the apostles slept.
###245 
###247 But Serra wasn't Simon of the Desert, standing on his pillar
###251 alone.
###253 He loved community, loved performing marriages.
###259 He traveled as much as he could in a pair or group,
###263 because outside the mission walls,
###266 lay a solitude so vast only the sun could disperse it.
###273 Now the dew was on the leaf, the earth shorn briefly of dust,
###278 dark and lovely and cool.
###281 The sun began its climb of the Santa Lucia Mountains,
###287 casting them in gray outline.
###290 As his mule snorted, taking him north in the early morning,
###297 the sun regarded Serra; he dared not look back.
###304 The sun, warm on his forehead, rising
###309 over the crown of the forest, now arched in his mind
###312 above the Tramuntana range of his old island
###317 and its olive groves to the sea, the Mediterranean waded
###323 into the Pacific, the sun wrapping the world in its arms.
###329 Who was God's companion?
###332 He was.
###334 For a second, he looked at the sun;
###338 God put a white spot in his eye.
###340 
###343 Anybody here ever looked at the sun?
###345 
###348 Not supposed to do that, right?
###349 
###352 And just to show you how complicated the choices are
###357 for a writer trying to bring an 18th century figure back
###362 to life, I still don't know if those spots are white or black.
###368 I chose white though in this case.
###372 What I just read you was the prologue to the book,
###374 "Journey to the Sun."
###376 It's barely more than a page.
###380 At one time, it was about 20 pages.
###384 My editor, whose name is Colin Harrison, who
###387 is an accomplished novelist, told
###390 me to throw out the 20 pages of the prologue,
###394 throw out the 10 pages of the preface,
###397 throw out the 30 pages of the introduction,
###401 everything at the beginning.
###403 And this is what his rationale was.
###406 Colin said, "I want the reader to encounter Serra's story
###411 right from the start and be pulled in by the force of it,
###416 by that and that alone.
###418 I don't want you parsing it or indicating upfront
###422 with the reader should expect or look for.
###425 I want him captured."
###427 And in a way, that's kind of like falling in love, right?
###432 Nobody explains to you why they feel that way.
###436 They just do.
###438 You just do.
###441 I hope that's what a good book does.
###445 The work on the prologue was only the first
###447 of many waves of editing the manuscript.
###454 It was 1,300 pages at one time.
###460 A good part of just 2013 alone was this relentless onslaught
###465 to bring it down.
###467 I mean there was blood all over the floor,
###471 Serra martyred many times.
###473 
###477 My own editor had an idea-- my own editor,
###480 Colin Harrison actually, and my provost at Westmont College,
###484 had a title for a talk.
###486 I've given two different kinds of talks for the past two weeks
###490 on this book tour.
###491 One is a general summary of Serra's life.
###493 And I'm going to do something different for you Google folks
###497 because I think you're sort of natively ready for something
###500 different.
###502 I'm going to give you the talk I gave my own faculty, which
###505 is I'm going to give you five major obstacles I had
###511 to encounter in writing this book,
###514 five challenges about dealing with the life of Father Serra
###522 and indeed researching it.
###525 And here they are.
###525 I'll summarize it for you.
###527 And then we'll go down one by one.
###529 Number one, how to transcend the regional critique?
###535 Oh, Serra?
###538 That's a California story.
###541 No New York publisher is going to be interested in that.
###544 OK.
###545 So the regional critique, how to get over it.
###547 Two, how to deal with the fact that half of Serra's life
###552 is document poor and half of it is document rich?
###557 
###560 Number three, what is the pivotal moment
###563 in the Serra story?
###565 Not so easy to figure, and we'll explore that.
###571 How to understand the fact of floggings in the missions?
###576 A tough one, that's number four.
###580 And number five, what techniques--
###583 writers' techniques-- what can I bring
###585 to bear after writing for 30 years?
###587 What tricks do I have in my basket and research goals
###594 could I best marshall to bring a celibate Spanish priest
###599 of the 18th century to life for a jaded, if not
###605 cynical, American culture?
###608 That's probably the hardest one of all.
###612 OK.
###613 Now, I want to say at the outset let's
###615 make this interactive in a way.
###618 We can do the Q&A in general at the end.
###621 Shannon, I'd would be happy to do it.
###622 But jump in if you feel you want more on something as we go down
###627 these five obstacles.
###629 I'll pause after each obstacle to see
###631 if you want to throw in another obstacle.
###634 
###637 OK, first, how to transcend the regional critique?
###641 
###645 Anybody have an idea?
###648 How would you transcend the regional critique?
###650 
###653 It's only a California story, right?
###658 Nobody's going to be interested in Junipero Serra.
###661 We already have William Bradford and the Massachusetts Bay
###666 Colony.
###667 We have Captain John Smith at Jamestown.
###670 What do we need Serra for?
###674 All right, I'll go into it.
###677 I wrote the first outline in 2001.
###680 So it's a 12-year year journey.
###683 I toiled alone without an agent for a long time,
###687 with that outline and a sample chapter.
###691 No success.
###693 Even my own former editor-- I had a great editor at the Free
###697 Press, which is another subsidiary of Simon & Schuster,
###700 for a book on World War II, about my father, in the war,
###704 call "Messengers of the Lost Battalion."
###706 My editor was Adam Bellow, who is
###708 the son of Saul Bellow, the Nobel Prize winning novelist.
###711 Adam is a pretty well-educated guy.
###713 He went to Princeton.
###714 He had never heard of Serra, never heard of him.
###720 So to me, now I thought I was holding
###723 onto a hopeless obsession.
###726 Even my old editor wasn't going to take it.
###731 One day, a friend of mine from Georgetown days,
###734 my undergraduate days-- his name is Jason Berry, who
###738 loved what I was trying to do and was gung ho about it
###741 from the start-- said send an outline and a sample chapter
###748 to my agent.
###750 I think he might look at it.
###753 Now, Jason is an interesting person.
###756 I don't want to get too off track on him.
###758 But I will just say that Jason Berry was the first author
###763 to uncover the pedophilia scandal
###765 in the Catholic priesthood.
###768 And he remained a Catholic, after 25 years
###773 of writing this hellish story.
###776 I have often told Jason, there's the book you got to write,
###779 why you stayed after all that misery.
###784 Well, maybe Francis I is the better part of it.
###790 So Jason's agent, Steve Hanselman, took a look
###795 and he got it.
###797 And why did he get it?
###798 Because he was born in Shafter, California,
###801 right outside of Bakersfield.
###803 But he was living and working in New York.
###807 So he loved it.
###808 And he knew what it was all about.
###809 
###812 Steve Hanselman understood that the Serra story
###816 was one that was important to him
###818 from childhood, in fact since the fourth grade.
###823 Now, how many here did a fourth grade mission project?
###826 All right.
###828 Which mission, Mike?
###831 Do you remember which one you did?
###833 MIKE: [INAUDIBLE].
###834 GREGORY ORFALEA: I see that was a mission you really loved.
###838 Shannon, do you remember?
###839 SHANNON: Carmel.
###840 GREGORY ORFALEA: Carmel, San Carlos Borromeo.
###842 I just was there.
###843 I love that mission.
###845 Mine was San Juan Capistrano.
###847 Anyone else?
###850 Anybody do San Gabriel, down in LA?
###853 That's a good one.
###854 Anyway, Steve Hanselman had done San Juan Capistrano too.
###859 Steve was convinced that Serra badly
###864 needed a realistic, unbiased treatment, one
###868 that was both celebratory and critical.
###871 He was convinced that the story had ripple effects far
###875 beyond California and could tell us
###877 much about the origins of the Hispanic influenced country we
###882 were becoming.
###883 
###885 So we went at it.
###888 And we totally revised the outline and the sample chapter.
###893 But we were turned down by 12 publishers,
###897 even with a gung ho agent.
###898 
###902 However, just when I was going to give up-- isn't that the way
###904 it always is?
###905 Just when you're about ready to pack it in,
###909 you get a little tinkle of a bell on your phone
###913 or at your door.
###917 And in this case, it was Colin Harrison at Scribner, the best
###921 publisher and the best editor, in my opinion, in New York.
###926 Colin-- and this is kind of what he said,
###928 I'm sort of paraphrasing.
###930 I am interested in alternate foundation
###933 stories for this country.
###935 And this is certainly one we know almost nothing about.
###939 And I thought, well, that's how it works.
###941 You're lost and then by dint of a kindred soul, you're found.
###947 Now, the flip side to the regional critique
###950 immediately hit me.
###952 Now, we have a contract.
###953 We have a pretty decent advance.
###955 I'm raring to go.
###958 The critique about the smallness of the story
###962 suddenly becomes the reality of an immense story.
###965 So what's the fear now?
###968 And I up to it?
###970 Can I handle this?
###971 I'm a literature guy, not a historian,
###974 although I've written histories.
###976 My background is literature and writing.
###979 So what can I bring to this task that's different?
###981 
###984 Well, I thought maybe-- what's literature most fascinated
###987 with?
###987 Character, character, a person, that's what I want.
###992 I want to get into the character of Serra.
###994 I want the people to walk in his sandals
###997 and know what it was like to live in the 18th century
###1000 and to do what he did.
###1001 
###1005 Luckily, I had an editor that divined right away that I
###1009 was insecure and bolstered me almost from the start.
###1014 He gave me his cell phone, his private cell phone.
###1017 I could call him on the weekends.
###1018 This has never happened to me before.
###1020 It happens to very few authors who aren't best sellers.
###1024 
###1026 He said we're going to go at it chapter by chapter and we did.
###1030 22 chapters, we had 22 conversations
###1034 of an hour or more on the phone for each of those chapters.
###1038 Uncanny.
###1038 
###1041 OK.
###1041 Yeah, the question is what drew me to Serra?
###1045 
###1050 Well, actually answer is the regional critique.
###1052 I was part of California.
###1053 
###1056 I don't know.
###1059 The earliest memory I have as a child is about 2 and 1/2,
###1068 of having a bird land on my upturned arm
###1073 at San Juan Capistrano Mission.
###1076 And the bird was pecking the bird seed out of my hand.
###1080 There's a photograph of it.
###1082 But I hadn't seen the photo in many years.
###1084 And in my mind I thought, oh, it must be a swallow
###1086 because the swallows come back to Capistrano,
###1089 on March 19, Saint Joseph's Feast Day.
###1092 And I thought I was part of that.
###1095 Well, it turned out it was a pigeon.
###1096 
###1099 But that early memory and that sense of sacred space,
###1102 the sense too of going to Georgetown
###1104 in the East for college, feeling like nobody
###1107 understood things that were really close to me
###1109 from California, the assumption that there's no history.
###1113 Californians are ahistorical.
###1115 They're trying to escape history.
###1116 That's why people go West.
###1118 Well, people went West after the Spaniards were there.
###1124 There's a lot of history before the Americans get here.
###1127 And that's what I want-- I think I was building up the instinct
###1131 to do this for many years, particularly in the East,
###1133 at Georgetown.
###1135 OK.
###1136 Challenge number two, how to deal
###1140 with the dearth of material on Serra's early life.
###1145 Up until "Journey to the Sun," there was in fact
###1148 only one extant letter of Junipero Serra,
###1153 up to his leaving Spain forever at the age of 36 from Cadiz.
###1158 OK, so I said one letter for the first half of his life
###1161 before he set sail.
###1163 That's not a lot.
###1166 Five letters for Mexico-- he was in Mexico for 18 years,
###1171 longer than he was here.
###1173 So six letters up through age 54.
###1177 I found two in my journeys.
###1181 Doesn't sound like a lot.
###1183 But you guys know better than I, what that is, a 33% increase.
###1189 So I feel pretty good about that.
###1193 I also should mention that part of this problem
###1195 with a dearth of material-- the challenges,
###1200 you got to become not just a historian,
###1202 but a sort of investigative reporter.
###1205 And you've got to travel.
###1206 I did five trips to Spain and Mexico.
###1208 
###1212 You've got to focus on the myths,
###1214 like a laser, especially the ones that
###1218 are most controversial.
###1220 And I've done that I hope in "Journey to the Sun."
###1224 Also the challenge becomes how to weave a story progression
###1231 through the creation of nine missions?
###1235 That's a challenge in itself.
###1236 Because no mission's story stops with the creation of a new one.
###1242 So you're weaving this man's life story
###1245 through the nine missions, which is
###1247 part three of the four parts of the book.
###1251 And you've got a chapter for each mission,
###1253 but then they overlap, interlace.
###1258 For example-- just a quick example--
###1262 the pivotal moment of the story, which
###1263 I think I'm coming up to that soon,
###1266 is the attack on San Diego Mission.
###1268 But the attack on San Diego Mission occurs in 1775.
###1273 Mission San Juan Capistrano is being founded.
###1276 So I have the attack on San Diego in the San Juan
###1279 Capistrano chapter.
###1281 And those are the kinds of things you have to deal with.
###1285 Now, you may wonder why is the Serra story so
###1288 document poor for the first 36 years of his life?
###1293 Anybody have any just random guesses or thoughts?
###1298 There's quite a few reasons.
###1299 
###1302 OK.
###1304 First of all, he taught at the Lullian University.
###1307 He had a chair in theology.
###1308 He was a very respected, erudite theologian in Palma
###1313 at the time.
###1316 That university, the Lullian University in Palma
###1319 was closed in 1835.
###1323 And a lot of the records, and sermons probably, and lectures
###1327 were lost.
###1329 How about 1936 to 1939?
###1334 What was going on in Spain at that time?
###1337 AUDIENCE: Civil war.
###1337 GREGORY ORFALEA: Civil war, to which
###1340 I would compare the Syrians' civil war today.
###1342 I think that's the one terribly tragic and bloody parallel
###1350 to what's going on in Syria.
###1351 The Spanish Civil War had Franco wiping out anything
###1355 having to do with Catalan identities.
###1359 Towns, Basque or Catalan, everything
###1362 was to be Castillian.
###1364 The language, the Catalan dialect,
###1367 he destroyed the dictionaries.
###1369 So Palma and Mallorca is part of Catalonia.
###1374 So it's very likely we lost Serra, or at least many
###1378 of Serra's holdings at the time of Generalissimo Franco.
###1381 So when you see "Guernica," the next time
###1383 you see that great painting by Picasso of "Guernica,"
###1388 with the explosions in San Sebastian and Bilbao,
###1392 think about we lost Serra right there, or at least
###1396 records of Serra.
###1397 
###1403 I did unearth four sermons of Serra
###1406 to Claretian nuns in the 1730s that very few had ever
###1411 seen before in Spanish.
###1412 And someone had done a sort of bad English translation
###1416 in the '90s that I found in Mallorca.
###1419 I added my own translation.
###1420 That really helped me with his way
###1422 of thinking about God and grace and suffering.
###1426 Walking the streets where Serra grew up in Petra,
###1430 being taken around Palma by a seminarian, who
###1433 was living in the same hall in the Confendo de San Francisco
###1437 in Palma that Serra had lived in as a young priest,
###1441 was invaluable.
###1443 In Barcelona, I sustained "the terrible triad."
###1447 I don't know if any of you have ever broken your elbows before.
###1450 Like an idiot, I chased a thief out of the metro
###1453 and hit a little escalan, which we
###1456 don't have in our metros, a little tiny step.
###1459 And when flying as I was chasing him
###1461 and smashed my elbow against stone, and broke two bones,
###1465 the radial, the ulna, and the tendon came off.
###1468 And they call that the terrible triad.
###1469 So on my wife and I spent a week in a hospital in Barcelona,
###1476 all in the service of trying to find some original documents
###1479 of Serra's.
###1481 And, in fact, I did come up with an original letter which
###1485 revealed several things that couldn't possibly
###1489 be seen in the transcription.
###1490 I actually held Serra's goodbye letter to his parents
###1494 in my hands, given to me by a Capuchin monk in Barcelona.
###1499 I had to put the white gloves and hold it.
###1501 And I saw two spots, which I'm going to share with you soon,
###1504 two spots on the goodbye letter.
###1506 Now, what do you think two spots would be in a goodbye letter
###1512 to parents?
###1513 Llora, tears, yeah, tears.
###1516 That's my guess.
###1517 Could be moisture damage too, I mean.
###1520 But that was sort of my feeling.
###1522 
###1525 I also uncovered in Oaxaca, after some relentless research
###1530 and coming up empty for days, I found
###1533 the name of a man who was having a 14-year affair with a woman,
###1540 who confessed it to Serra.
###1546 Now, we knew about this unknown person's confession.
###1551 We didn't know the name of the man.
###1552 It's briefly disgusted in a 1787 biography
###1557 by a friend of his, Francisco Palou,
###1560 and then dropped for 200 years.
###1562 Briefly mentioned in 1959 by Father Maynard Geiger,
###1566 the last major biography.
###1568 I thought, whoa, I want to find out who those people were.
###1572 And I did.
###1574 And once I had the name of the man who
###1576 was carrying on the affair, Don Mathias Cortabarria,
###1579 I ran around Oaxaca to five archivists
###1582 And archivists love it when you give them something.
###1586 They just love-- they sit around in these kind of dreary jobs
###1589 all day long-- dust of the archive.
###1594 And it's pretty grim.
###1596 But when they have something and they
###1598 know someone's on the trail of something centuries back,
###1600 they love it.
###1601 And they just really worked hard for me
###1603 and found many of these names.
###1607 OK, any questions about the document-poor, document-rich?
###1613 I should save the document-rich part of the story
###1615 is that one Serra gets to California,
###1617 you have 264 letters.
###1619 So it's a bumper crop.
###1621 Now, it's what do you use?
###1623 What do you throw out and what do you use?
###1627 OK.
###1628 Number three, the third obstacle,
###1631 trying to pin down the pivotal moment.
###1635 Because a lot of the editors, prior to Collin taking it,
###1638 want to know, OK, what's the fulcrum here?
###1641 What's the fulcrum of the story?
###1644 I struggled at first.
###1645 I thought maybe it was Serra's decision to leave everything.
###1650 He ever went home.
###1651 He never saw his parents again.
###1652 He was so nervous about saying goodbye to them,
###1656 he couldn't address the goodbye letter to them.
###1660 He addressed the goodbye letter to a cousin, who was a priest,
###1663 and said give it to them.
###1666 Could that be the pivotal moment?
###1668 Well, maybe.
###1669 But what do you do then?
###1670 If that's the pivotal moment, he's
###1671 still got half of his life left.
###1673 That doesn't serve.
###1674 
###1678 How about the spider bite at Vera Cruz?
###1680 When he first landed in Vera Cruz, and he was 36,
###1684 he was bitten by a spider, walking from Vera Cruz
###1688 to Mexico City, 250 miles.
###1690 It festered.
###1692 It necrotized over time.
###1693 And it pained him for 25 years, the rest of his life,
###1697 walking all over California.
###1699 A pretty serious pivotal moment, but a little amorphous too.
###1704 Was it his despair after the Cortabarria incident?
###1708 I didn't mention this.
###1709 But the man who was having the affair with the woman that
###1713 confessed to Serra, when he realized that the woman was not
###1717 coming back to him, he hanged himself.
###1721 And this had great repercussions in Oaxaca and affected Serra.
###1728 How about Serra's meeting with the viceroy in 1774, when
###1736 he went all the way back from Carmel,
###1739 down through Baja, over on ship to San Blas, to Mexico City,
###1745 and pleaded with the viceroy not to shut the whole
###1747 project down because there was a terrible epidemic
###1753 almost of molestation by the soldiers,
###1756 of the Indian women, which Serra totally decried and fought.
###1763 But he was worried because their one was stopping them.
###1768 The commandantes were not cashiering these soldiers,
###1771 that the viceroy was going to end the project at California.
###1776 In the end, I picked the incident
###1778 I mentioned to you, Serra's reaction
###1782 to the murder of Father Luis Jayme, who grew up
###1786 with him in Mallorca, during the second attack of Mission San
###1790 Diego by the Kumeyaay.
###1792 And I'll read just a brief little part of that,
###1794 and then we'll run to the end.
###1798 In the wake of the second major Indian uprising in California,
###1803 Serra sat down December 15, 1775,
###1808 to write a soul-searching letter to Viceroy Bucareli in Mexico
###1812 City.
###1813 I should mention that although the attack took place
###1816 in San Diego, Serra was not there.
###1818 He was in Carmel.
###1819 Carmel was his home mission.
###1821 So he didn't get the news for a couple weeks.
###1823 But when he did, and he knew that Indians had been arrested,
###1827 at least nine, and then later a total of 24,
###1831 to be executed-- they were on death row-- he had to act fast.
###1836 So he wrote this letter.
###1839 He contemplated the burned, shredded baptismal records,
###1843 the stolen vestments and utensils of the Sacristy.
###1848 He hovered on giving up.
###1851 He reminded Bucareli of his insistence
###1854 at the beginning of these conquests quote, "That in case
###1858 the Indians, whether pagans or Christians, would kill me,
###1863 they should be pardoned."
###1867 From the very onset of the Spanish movement into Alta
###1870 California, Serra seemed to sense violence was inevitable
###1876 and he wasn't going to return it.
###1880 Nor did he want the military to return it.
###1882 
###1886 Serra's insistent note to Bucareli
###1889 was not only exceptional in its anticipatory mercy,
###1892 it seemed to beg the question of the whole enterprise.
###1897 This is a stunning position.
###1900 It's almost as if Serra were asking for forgiveness,
###1903 not only for the Indian, but from him,
###1909 knowing what the Indian was going
###1910 to have to give up even if he felt he was offering a better
###1914 way, salvation, as he understood it.
###1918 
###1920 So Serra attacked the clemency simply and profoundly.
###1924 And I'll give you the exact quote in his letter
###1928 to Bucareli.
###1930 "To prevent the Indian from killing others,
###1933 let the soldiers protect us in better fashion than they
###1938 did the now deceased padre.
###1941 And as to the killer, let him live so that he can be saved.
###1947 For that is the purpose of our coming
###1949 here and its sole justification."
###1954 In short, "the gospel of love."
###1962 All right, the fourth challenge.
###1963 Yes, sir?
###1964 AUDIENCE: What happened?
###1965 GREGORY ORFALEA: What happened?
###1967 AUDIENCE: Did the letter take effect?
###1968 GREGORY ORFALEA: Bucareli was deeply moved.
###1971 He ordered all the Indians released.
###1973 In fact, one of them, probably the leader of the attack,
###1977 Carlos, whose native name was Chisli, Carlos and his brother
###1983 Francisco, they were both in on this rebellion,
###1986 became very close to the missions, particularly
###1990 Francisco.
###1990 I think he was a leader of Christian Indians in San Diego.
###1994 Carlos kind of went in and out of-- he
###1996 was a bit of a recidivist.
###1998 But he ended up at Carmel ironically,
###2001 after Serra died, and had his family there
###2004 and worked the mission in Carmel.
###2005 
###2009 The fourth challenge was how to deal
###2011 with the most troubling, if not revolting,
###2013 fact of Father Serra's life, that he allowed and even
###2018 advocated floggings for penance and discipline in the missions,
###2023 often against the very Indians he was otherwise protecting.
###2027 
###2030 I'll only say here I was faced with a twofold problem,
###2035 a moral one and a narrative one.
###2040 The first was easier to confront.
###2043 Serra was wrong.
###2046 There's no way to gainsay it.
###2048 Despite the fact that disciplinary floggings were
###2051 commonly used in schools, as well as prisons,
###2055 throughout Europe, Serra should have
###2058 had the wisdom to be as ahead of his times in this area
###2062 as he was in others.
###2065 The narrative problem was tougher.
###2068 If I tackled the issue of floggings too early,
###2072 I might lose the reader's commitment to the Serra story
###2076 before it even began.
###2077 
###2080 And although I sprinkled references to the floggings
###2083 in the book prior, I don't focus intensely on it
###2087 until the last night of his life.
###2091 And it's the end of part three of a four-part book.
###2097 And that night, I begin the chapter
###2099 actually with this quote from that night.
###2101 Serra says, "I have come under the shadow of fear."
###2107 That's when I deal with the floggings.
###2109 
###2111 It's hard to explain them away.
###2113 But you have to remember that this
###2116 was a sort utopic community, the mission.
###2120 And the Indians were not forced to come in.
###2123 That's a myth.
###2124 It wasn't slavery.
###2127 It was a kind of indentured servitude though.
###2130 Because once they were in, then they
###2132 were committed to a community that needed their work.
###2137 They were given clothes.
###2139 They were given food and shelter and a home at a time
###2144 when lots was going on in the native villages.
###2148 The germs were spreading.
###2150 The microbes were out and about.
###2152 And a lot of Indians were dying.
###2154 So the mission, and I say this at one point,
###2158 the great irony of the California missions
###2161 is that they were both protection and exposure.
###2167 The Indians were seen as children, not-- how can
###2171 I say this?
###2174 We've all read some books where the padres refer to their flock
###2177 as "my children."
###2179 I don't think it was you're inferior than me.
###2182 But it was a kind of way of regarding the neophytes,
###2186 as they were called, as newcomers
###2189 in the Christian faith.
###2191 As such, the number of the thrashings
###2197 was half of what an adult would get.
###2201 That's 12 versus 25.
###2203 That still doesn't make it right.
###2205 Personally, I think probably the worst
###2207 thing about the thrashings was not
###2208 the physical pain, but the humiliation.
###2211 
###2214 People would steal.
###2216 There was adultery that went on.
###2219 I don't have to tell you what went on in New England
###2221 with adultery.
###2222 they didn't whip you.
###2223 They burned witches at the stake,
###2225 who they thought to be witches.
###2228 We have to be careful when writing history
###2230 of what's known as the presentism problem,
###2235 to judge the past with our present attitudes
###2242 and moral standards.
###2245 Still, like I say-- and I make no bones about this,
###2250 I think it was wrong.
###2252 Yes, sir?
###2252 AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].
###2253 
###2258 GREGORY ORFALEA: It was actually part
###2260 of the whole Spanish project.
###2263 And, in fact, it was part of the English project.
###2265 The English thrashed their students
###2267 at prep schools, such as Eaton.
###2271 What was it?
###2271 
###2274 Four thrashings was a scrubbing.
###2277 Six lashes was a bibling in Eaton.
###2284 This was the standard of the time.
###2286 I suspect it was probably not much different in Asia.
###2290 I mean, unfortunately, corporeal punishment
###2293 or corporal punishment was a standard.
###2296 Now, I will hasten to say that even during Serra's time,
###2301 people took issue with it.
###2303 One of the governor's took issue with it.
###2305 And he got into a big argument with him in 1780.
###2308 And I mention that.
###2310 By the 1820s, it was abolished throughout the Spanish lands.
###2314 So although it was the standard, it
###2319 was beginning to come under question.
###2322 To move forward to last obstacle--
###2324 and then we'll open it up-- the last obstacle
###2329 was, in the words of Frank Buck, how to bring him back alive.
###2333 
###2335 Another way of stating this is how to make the Serra story
###2340 neither hagiography-- and hagiography,
###2344 overly praising or excessive adulation
###2350 of the subject-- nor a broadside attack.
###2354 In short, how to make Serra a real man.
###2357 One way to do this was to make those
###2360 that he came to save for Christ, real men and women, that
###2365 is the Indians of California.
###2367 So I had to do a lot of research about Indian culture.
###2370 As those of you have written books know--
###2372 or people who've organized them, been involved
###2376 with researching-- organization is theme.
###2380 I tried to effect a kind of ecumenism
###2384 by dividing the first two parts of the book like this.
###2386 Part one is Serra before California
###2391 and part two is California before Serra.
###2395 Then we combine them in part three.
###2397 And then it's after his death and the sainthood
###2400 issue in part four.
###2401 So it's pretty simple.
###2402 But there was a method to my madness.
###2407 Another method of bringing him back alive
###2409 was to bring back alive the women
###2411 he loved, which included the Blessed Mother
###2415 herself, his sister and mother, Maria Contreras in Oaxaca.
###2420 That's the woman who confessed to him, the affair.
###2424 And Maria de Agreda-- has anyone here ever heard
###2427 of the 17th century nun, Maria de Agreda?
###2431 I had never heard of her before I started the story.
###2435 She was said to have by bilocated 500 times
###2439 from Spain, Agreda, Spain, to New Mexico.
###2443 And in the book, I say, well, there's
###2444 a spiritual frequent flyer if there was one.
###2447 
###2450 It's quite a story, Maria de Agreda.
###2452 But all this to say that other than his Bible
###2455 and his divine office, the only other book
###2458 that Serra had in his bag all over California
###2462 was "The Mystical City of God" written
###2464 by Maria de Agreda, a four-volume novelistic
###2468 treatment of the Blessed Mother.
###2470 Anybody here interested in women studies,
###2472 take a look at that book.
###2474 Not too many women novelists in the 17th century.
###2477 And here's one writing four volumes about Mary.
###2480 Serra was entranced.
###2481 
###2484 Another way I tried to bring him back alive
###2487 was to use fictional techniques about nonfiction.
###2491 And that is, occasionally I will put interior thoughts
###2495 in italics.
###2496 I try not to overdo it.
###2498 I always ground it in the real record.
###2502 And when the record runs out, I'll
###2504 sometimes use the subjunctive mood.
###2509 And my editor said, oh, yeah, the subjunctive
###2512 will be the salve for the wound.
###2515 
###2518 Beyond research for new primary and secondary material
###2522 and the somewhat risky techniques
###2524 was the matter of walking in his shoes,
###2526 in Mallorca, mainland Spain, Mexico,
###2529 and the two Californians.
###2530 This was exhausting, exhilarating,
###2533 and for me at times deeply humbling.
###2536 The Serra story is interdisciplinary from start
###2539 to finish.
###2540 You must steep yourself in the art he loved,
###2543 his theological models, the history of the times,
###2547 the history of the Church, music, literature, geography,
###2550 and the environment.
###2552 And finally, I had a field day envisioning
###2555 the beauty of our wondrous state through the eyes of one who
###2559 fell in love with it for life, causing great hope
###2562 and great pain for its inhabitants.
###2564 And I'll leave you with this short paragraph
###2567 of Serra traveling south, looking out on the water.
###2572 Troubled before La Assumpta-- La Assumpta
###2574 is an Indian village near present-day Ventura-- Serra
###2578 saw something out on the blue of the calm
###2582 morning, a wound on the sea, a lambent dark red, the kelp
###2589 beds, like a stigmata on the water.
###2594 At the hottest point of the sun, he
###2596 might have climbed off the mule, taken to the sea, the water
###2600 making his robes heavy, but his heart light.
###2604 Close up, the kelp was golden, its pods upright in the water.
###2609 The kelp leaf could pass over his face like a hand.
###2613 God, he loved suffering for this beauty.
###2617 Thanks.
###2618 [APPLAUSE]
###2624 So a couple of quick images and then we'll call it an evening.
###2629 This is Mt.
###2630 Ronda in Mallorca, a beautiful upsurge of mountain.
###2634 They're all over the island.
###2635 And there are sanctuaries and monks, monasteries up there.
###2639 This is where one of Serra's models,
###2643 the 13th century monk Raymond Lull,
###2645 claimed to have seen a vision of Christ crucified while he was
###2651 living his dissolute life, sort of like Saint
###2653 Augustine in his 20s.
###2655 Raymond Lull was writing a letter to one of his lovers.
###2658 And he saw this image of Christ crucified on Mt.
###2661 Ronda.
###2662 And it was a place that Serra loved.
###2665 Here's Soller.
###2666 Now, what does that remind you of, that landscape?
###2670 California.
###2671 So I always say, Serra left home to go home.
###2675 It's beautiful.
###2676 If you've never been to Mallorca, you won't regret it.
###2679 This is Soller, which is where the olive press,
###2682 the great olive press was.
###2684 And Serra and his father would take the olives
###2686 on a mule train over the mountain, the Tramuntana,
###2690 down into Soller, which was a port town,
###2692 and put the olives in the great grinder.
###2695 There he is.
###2698 Now, that's probably the only painting he really sat for.
###2704 But we're not even sure that he did.
###2706 But we guess around 1773, we think
###2710 it was Jose de Paez, who was a great Mexican painter.
###2716 He looks a little fraught, I'd say, puzzled.
###2720 
###2723 The copy-- the original, if it ever existed, is no more.
###2727 This is one extant copy.
###2730 And it's at Mission Santa Barbara.
###2732 So if you ever want to see it, that's where it is.
###2735 OK, the goodbye letter to his parents.
###2737 I flipped it.
###2738 This is the fourth leaf.
###2741 Remember, I was talking about the spots
###2744 on the goodbye letter?
###2746 Let's see, can you see it here?
###2748 There's one way up here and then one down here.
###2751 I don't know if you can see it.
###2753 It's not quite focused.
###2754 But it's there.
###2756 Also take a look at how he finished the letter.
###2760 This is the actual letter.
###2761 This is the margin.
###2762 And on the side of the leaf, he just
###2765 couldn't stop saying goodbye.
###2767 Goodbye to my-- please express goodbye to my cousins, Jose.
###2771 And please say goodbye to the baker down the street in Petra.
###2775 He just filled this with goodbyes.
###2777 It's obviously a very painful letter.
###2780 And then he ends it, cordial amigo
###2782 in Cristo, your cordial friend in Christ,
###2785 Junipero Serra, Junipero Serra, indigno sacerdote,
###2790 which in Latin is "unworthy priest."
###2793 But look at this.
###2795 There's a little squiggle here.
###2797 And I think-- and you wouldn't see
###2800 unless you saw the original-- that he added a superlative.
###2805 It's not "indigno."
###2806 It's "indignisimo," which means "most unworthy priest."
###2811 All right, here's North America in 1663.
###2816 You see California?
###2816 
###2821 It's this huge island.
###2823 And that's what California was taken as for a long time.
###2827 Into the middle of the 18th century,
###2829 California was thought to be an island.
###2831 And in this case, it's half the size of the continental United
###2835 States.
###2836 This is "The Founding" in Monterrey--
###2838 the great painting called "The Founding."
###2841 The painting is 1877, but the event was 1700-- 1770, sorry,
###2848 the second mission.
###2852 This is the Vizcaino.
###2853 It's no longer there today.
###2855 But there was an earlier mass done in 1602
###2858 by the explorer Sebastian Vizcaino.
###2861 And in it lasted for many years, until it finally
###2864 rotted and was thrown into the bay when
###2866 they were building a train, in about 1905.
###2872 Probably one of the more famous trees in American history.
###2875 I mentioned Maria de Agreda.
###2877 This is a picture of her I got from Zacatecas in Mexico.
###2882 Here's Maria.
###2883 And she's sitting next to one of the evangelists.
###2886 Can you guess which one, the four gospel writers?
###2890 It's John, Saint John.
###2892 And they each are wielding a pen-- writers.
###2896 And this is the name of her great book on Mary.
###2901 I mentioned to you the last night of his life
###2904 was-- great fear had come over him.
###2907 This is the great fear painting.
###2909 
###2912 If there was any doubt that's what he had said-- very soon,
###2915 he died in 1784.
###2917 So six years later, there's a painting about this moment.
###2921 It was legendary even then.
###2923 And it would have to have been transferred
###2924 by his very close friend and first biographer, Francisco
###2928 Palou.
###2930 Here's Serra in the middle.
###2931 This is Palou himself, doing last rites.
###2934 Can you see?
###2934 It's not easy to see it.
###2937 Maybe over here, more easy.
###2939 There's a face above Palou.
###2941 Can you see it?
###2943 It's very difficult to see on this project-- that's
###2946 an Indian, Indian chief.
###2949 And on the left is probably Governor Pedro Fagus,
###2953 who clashed with Serra constantly.
###2957 I love this painting.
###2958 It's shown in Carmel Mission once a year,
###2961 for the week before Christmas.
###2963 And it's Mary being visited by St. Elizabeth, who's
###2968 pregnant with John the Baptist.
###2969 And Mary, of course, is pregnant with Christ.
###2972 The painting was done around 1500.
###2975 And it is in the Uffizi in Florence, the great Uffizi
###2980 gallery.
###2980 This is a copy.
###2982 And the copy-- a very good one-- is in Carmel Mission.
###2986 Oh god, forget him.
###2990 I'm out the childhood window.
###2991 And the last picture will make my wife--
###2993 she's in the backyard of Serra's home in Petra, looking
###2999 a little-- oh, Greg, isn't it time to go?
###3002 Well, thank you.
###3004 [APPLAUSE]
