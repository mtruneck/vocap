1
0:0:31,748 --> 0:0:36,656
There are many stories in the history of our world.


2
0:0:36,656 --> 0:0:38,744
Most are lost,


3
0:0:38,744 --> 0:0:43,452
scattered in the winds of Time,


4
0:0:43,452 --> 0:0:47,207
beyond the memory of man.


5
0:0:47,207 --> 0:0:49,27
But this story.


6
0:0:49,27 --> 0:0:50,599
our story


7
0:0:50,599 --> 0:1:4,383
should not be forgotten.


8
0:1:4,383 --> 0:1:16,428
Papa!


9
0:1:16,428 --> 0:1:19,951
Maia!


10
0:1:19,951 --> 0:1:46,369
Run! Maia run. Maia run!


11
0:1:46,369 --> 0:1:49,666
We came from the water,


12
0:1:49,666 --> 0:1:53,94
It runs through our ancient days,


13
0:1:53,94 --> 0:1:57,95
down the long years to this moment


14
0:1:57,95 --> 0:1:58,977
coursing through our lives


15
0:1:58,977 --> 0:2:1,743
like the bloodline of Kings


16
0:2:1,743 --> 0:2:4,831
A swiftly flowing stream


17
0:2:4,831 --> 0:2:10,512
of memory and sorrow


18
0:2:10,512 --> 0:2:12,789
One drop of water


19
0:2:12,789 --> 0:2:14,765
of blood


20
0:2:14,765 --> 0:2:17,4
and then another


21
0:2:17,4 --> 0:2:20,217
can become a ripple,


22
0:2:20,217 --> 0:2:21,813
a river,


23
0:2:21,813 --> 0:2:24,935
a rising torrent


24
0:2:24,935 --> 0:2:26,724
unstoppable


25
0:2:26,724 --> 0:2:28,713
which in time


26
0:2:28,713 --> 0:2:31,39
breaks down all resistance


27
0:2:31,39 --> 0:2:33,139
to flow free once again


28
0:2:33,139 --> 0:2:38,897
on the journey to it's destiny


29
0:2:38,897 --> 0:2:41,177
The remnant of the faithful


30
0:2:41,177 --> 0:2:42,845
The Dúnedain


31
0:2:42,845 --> 0:2:45,975
the men of the West


32
0:2:45,975 --> 0:2:49,133
were scattered and few


33
0:2:49,133 --> 0:2:54,23
and beset by many dangers


34
0:2:54,23 --> 0:2:56,398
For the Dark Lord Sauron


35
0:2:56,398 --> 0:2:59,893
had not forgotten the past


36
0:2:59,893 --> 0:3:2,93
and of all the peoples of Middle-earth


37
0:3:2,93 --> 0:3:7,68
he held none with more hatred


38
0:3:7,68 --> 0:3:8,514
and more fear


39
0:3:8,514 --> 0:3:11,8
than the Dúnedain


40
0:3:11,8 --> 0:3:14,717
He spread his will amongst his servants


41
0:3:14,717 --> 0:3:16,337
and through the long years


42
0:3:16,337 --> 0:3:21,774
sought ever to discover if the Heirs of Isildur yet lived


43
0:3:21,774 --> 0:3:24,778
so that he might destroy them


44
0:3:24,778 --> 0:3:27,178
and the last of his greatest enemies


45
0:3:27,178 --> 0:3:29,412
would be lost


46
0:3:29,412 --> 0:3:50,924
forever


47
0:3:50,924 --> 0:3:55,664
Hurry!  Hurry!


48
0:3:55,664 --> 0:4:3,618
Dírhael!


49
0:4:3,618 --> 0:4:7,631
Ivorwen!  Gilraen!  Go!  Please!


50
0:4:7,631 --> 0:5:44,657
I will not lose you all this day.


51
0:5:44,657 --> 0:6:12,15
Arathorn!


52
0:6:12,15 --> 0:6:14,802
You have my thanks sir,


53
0:6:14,802 --> 0:6:18,59
and whatever service I and my family may provide you and yours.


54
0:6:18,59 --> 0:6:21,261
We owe you our lives.


55
0:6:21,261 --> 0:6:24,957
As I owe you mine. I thank you, lady.


56
0:6:24,957 --> 0:6:28,797
You are most welcome, my lord.


57
0:6:28,797 --> 0:6:32,118
We cannot stay here.  Where were you bound?


58
0:6:32,118 --> 0:6:34,721
I do not know, my lord.


59
0:6:34,721 --> 0:6:38,55
Orcs burned our village, and slew our people.


60
0:6:38,55 --> 0:6:42,101
Those who were not killed were scattered, I know not where.


61
0:6:42,101 --> 0:6:44,698
Dorlad, my son.


62
0:6:44,698 --> 0:6:47,68
Struck down as he defended us.


63
0:6:47,68 --> 0:6:51,9
We would not leave his body for the cruel sport of orcs.


64
0:6:51,9 --> 0:6:53,918
Your son shall have a safe resting place, lady.


65
0:6:53,918 --> 0:6:55,647
You will come with us.


66
0:6:55,647 --> 0:7:0,145
Arathorn!


67
0:7:0,145 --> 0:7:4,158
Arathorn?


68
0:7:4,158 --> 0:7:5,671
You know him, father?


69
0:7:5,671 --> 0:7:7,43
Yes


70
0:7:7,43 --> 0:7:10,61
Or I did when he was but a child.


71
0:7:10,61 --> 0:7:12,334
If he is the same man,


72
0:7:12,334 --> 0:7:15,34
he is the son of my friend and kinsman.


73
0:7:15,34 --> 0:7:17,81
Our chieftain, Lord Arador.


74
0:7:17,81 --> 0:7:21,279
Isildur's Heir.


75
0:7:21,279 --> 0:7:22,751
What is it?


76
0:7:22,751 --> 0:7:26,103
They're after plunder, it seems.


77
0:7:26,103 --> 0:7:29,27
But these are but baubles.


78
0:7:29,27 --> 0:7:30,559
It is strange.


79
0:7:30,559 --> 0:7:34,683
Orcs seeking gold and jewels in the Wild?


80
0:7:34,683 --> 0:7:42,467
to what purpose?


81
0:7:42,467 --> 0:7:45,208
You're becoming more like him by the day.


82
0:7:45,208 --> 0:7:48,951
Is that what he would have wanted?


83
0:7:48,951 --> 0:7:54,581
He would have growled at me for letting you take his place.


84
0:7:54,581 --> 0:7:58,767
"The wild is no place for my daughter!"


85
0:7:58,767 --> 0:8:2,71
But I'm still glad I trained you.


86
0:8:2,71 --> 0:8:3,83
So am I.


87
0:8:3,83 --> 0:8:14,517
Lord Arathorn


88
0:8:14,517 --> 0:8:16,967
They'll bring no news to whoever leads them.


89
0:8:16,967 --> 0:8:18,391
Good work Halbaron.


90
0:8:18,391 --> 0:8:25,495
Now we must bring these three to safety.


91
0:8:25,495 --> 0:8:28,592
We go to Taurdal, our village, Lord?


92
0:8:28,592 --> 0:8:29,997
Dírhael.


93
0:8:29,997 --> 0:8:32,177
My wife, Ivorwen.  And my daughter...


94
0:8:32,177 --> 0:8:34,76
Gilraen.


95
0:8:34,76 --> 0:8:36,35
And I am Arathorn.


96
0:8:36,35 --> 0:8:39,44
Son of Arador.


97
0:8:39,44 --> 0:8:41,251
Indeed.


98
0:8:41,251 --> 0:8:43,57
No, no.  Do not bow.


99
0:8:43,57 --> 0:8:44,32
When you come to my father,


100
0:8:44,32 --> 0:8:46,228
you may greet him thus.


101
0:8:46,228 --> 0:8:47,973
But for now,


102
0:8:47,973 --> 0:8:58,246
we must make haste.


103
0:8:58,246 --> 0:9:2,971
A jealous heart finds no room for true affection,


104
0:9:2,971 --> 0:9:6,311
though it were standing right behind it.


105
0:9:6,311 --> 0:9:9,281
What have I to be jealous about?


106
0:9:9,281 --> 0:9:11,609
I saw that look between them.


107
0:9:11,609 --> 0:9:14,43
Just as you did.


108
0:9:14,43 --> 0:9:16,528
Your eyes deceive you.


109
0:9:16,528 --> 0:9:18,945
Besides, it has nothing to do with me.


110
0:9:18,945 --> 0:9:20,255
Does it not?


111
0:9:20,255 --> 0:9:21,314
No!


112
0:9:21,314 --> 0:9:29,718
Nor with you, Dírhaborn.


113
0:9:29,718 --> 0:9:35,757
And so Arathorn and his rangers led the grieving family North,


114
0:9:35,757 --> 0:9:38,822
past the mighty rivers


115
0:9:38,822 --> 0:9:42,99
and through the vast forests of Rhudaur.


116
0:9:42,99 --> 0:9:47,394
A land that still enjoyed the watchful eye of the Dúnedain


117
0:9:47,394 --> 0:9:53,317
and brought them to his father, Lord Arador,


118
0:9:53,317 --> 0:10:3,653
in the hidden settlement of Taurdal.


119
0:10:3,653 --> 0:10:16,42
Come, my old friend and kinsman.


120
0:10:16,42 --> 0:10:20,364
Let us bestow upon your son the peace and honour he has earned.


121
0:10:20,364 --> 0:10:23,203
For I account your loss as my loss,


122
0:10:23,203 --> 0:11:0,613
and your grief as my own.


123
0:11:0,613 --> 0:11:6,183
Alas, no long sleep in ancient halls of stone


124
0:11:6,183 --> 0:11:12,227
for a son of the House of Aranarth!


125
0:11:12,227 --> 0:11:15,873
But I will not see your bones dishonoured, Dorlad,


126
0:11:15,873 --> 0:11:18,765
when the servants of Evil try again


127
0:11:18,765 --> 0:11:23,625
to drive the Dúnedain farther into exile!


128
0:11:23,625 --> 0:12:34,277
Farewell!


129
0:12:34,277 --> 0:12:39,636
I've come to ask your forgiveness.


130
0:12:39,636 --> 0:12:43,956
Long had I thought your feelings for Arathorn


131
0:12:43,956 --> 0:12:47,876
no more than a passing fancy


132
0:12:47,876 --> 0:12:51,3
and that in time you would turn from them


133
0:12:51,3 --> 0:12:57,308
and look around you at last.


134
0:12:57,308 --> 0:13:2,652
I did not understand.


135
0:13:2,652 --> 0:13:7,555
Until last night.


136
0:13:7,555 --> 0:13:9,631
Years I have spent by his side,


137
0:13:9,631 --> 0:13:12,319
yet there is a gulf between us


138
0:13:12,319 --> 0:13:18,929
that only the flames of a stranger's pyre could reveal.


139
0:13:18,929 --> 0:13:23,635
I cannot vie with such beauty and such sorrow.


140
0:13:23,635 --> 0:13:34,763
El, any man would be honoured to call you his.


141
0:13:34,763 --> 0:14:33,923
I would cause him nothing but grief.


142
0:14:33,923 --> 0:14:41,879
We found these after the attack yesterday.


143
0:14:41,879 --> 0:14:45,861
It is strange how such tiny things


144
0:14:45,861 --> 0:14:48,524
can bring such immense darkness


145
0:14:48,524 --> 0:14:51,124
and change into our lives.


146
0:14:51,124 --> 0:14:55,805
Lord Arador now had much to contemplate.


147
0:14:55,805 --> 0:15:1,597
News of orcs assailing other villages came to his ears.


148
0:15:1,597 --> 0:15:5,489
Peaceful homesteads, far from help,


149
0:15:5,489 --> 0:15:8,497
were likewise menaced,


150
0:15:8,497 --> 0:15:13,115
Taurdal filled as many of the Dúnedain fled their homes


151
0:15:13,115 --> 0:15:16,669
and sought safety in numbers.


152
0:15:16,669 --> 0:15:20,801
And so Arador led his brave rangers


153
0:15:20,801 --> 0:15:24,121
in a quest to rid the land of the menace


154
0:15:24,121 --> 0:15:26,293
that had ravaged his people.


155
0:15:26,293 --> 0:15:29,615
Yet the most trusted of his men,


156
0:15:29,615 --> 0:15:51,65
would not be at his side.


157
0:15:51,65 --> 0:15:53,679
How goes the harvest, my lady?


158
0:15:53,679 --> 0:16:0,626
Bountiful, my lord.


159
0:16:0,626 --> 0:16:5,836
I had expected a little more for my travels.


160
0:16:5,836 --> 0:16:8,898
Are you leaving?


161
0:16:8,898 --> 0:16:12,124
My father has charged me to seek out the enemy's purpose


162
0:16:12,124 --> 0:16:14,287
in the cold mountains of the East.


163
0:16:14,287 --> 0:16:15,729
Alone?


164
0:16:15,729 --> 0:16:17,97
Yes.


165
0:16:17,97 --> 0:16:19,51
A dangerous mission my lord.


166
0:16:19,51 --> 0:16:21,222
Indeed.


167
0:16:21,222 --> 0:16:24,238
There was a time when such danger would not have moved me


168
0:16:24,238 --> 0:16:26,56
and every part of my being would happily travel to the end of the world


169
0:16:26,56 --> 0:16:28,74
in service of our people.


170
0:16:28,74 --> 0:16:32,0
But now?


171
0:16:32,0 --> 0:16:38,612
Now a part of me remains here.


172
0:16:38,612 --> 0:16:40,688
And that is my heart.


173
0:16:40,688 --> 0:16:42,746
My Lord.


174
0:16:42,746 --> 0:16:44,549
I am sorry my lady, I did not mean to upset you


175
0:16:44,549 --> 0:16:46,552
I will look to the East


176
0:16:46,552 --> 0:16:50,693
and await your safe return.


177
0:16:50,693 --> 0:16:54,568
My Lady.


178
0:16:54,568 --> 0:16:57,136
With a heart full of joy


179
0:16:57,136 --> 0:16:59,636
Arathorn travelled far beyond


180
0:16:59,636 --> 0:17:57,51
the fallen cities of Arnor.


181
0:17:57,51 --> 0:18:2,816
While Arathorn made his lonely way into the cold mountains,


182
0:18:2,816 --> 0:18:5,985
Gilraen would await his homecoming


183
0:18:5,985 --> 0:18:8,857
in the fading summer of the West.


184
0:18:8,857 --> 0:18:13,119
Straying at whiles deep into the forest,


185
0:18:13,119 --> 0:18:15,309
to watch for his safe return.


186
0:18:15,309 --> 0:18:16,192
Gilraen!


187
0:18:16,192 --> 0:18:20,109
I will not go far!


188
0:18:20,109 --> 0:18:22,201
Why does she do that?


189
0:18:22,201 --> 0:18:24,961
You know for whom she waits.


190
0:18:24,961 --> 0:18:26,399
She is too young.


191
0:18:26,399 --> 0:18:28,398
But not without wisdom.


192
0:18:28,398 --> 0:18:30,192
My heart forebodes Arathorn will wear


193
0:18:30,192 --> 0:18:32,789
Barahir's ring sooner than expected.


194
0:18:32,789 --> 0:18:34,166
Even so,


195
0:18:34,166 --> 0:18:35,852
I do not think he will long lead the Dúnedain,


196
0:18:35,852 --> 0:18:39,145
once it rests upon his hand.


197
0:18:39,145 --> 0:18:41,776
Then do not stand in their way, Dírhael!


198
0:18:41,776 --> 0:18:43,156
For if these two wed soon,


199
0:18:43,156 --> 0:18:45,873
there yet may be hope born for our people.


200
0:18:45,873 --> 0:18:48,28
But if they do not,


201
0:18:48,28 --> 0:18:51,775
it may be, in this gathering darkness,


202
0:18:51,775 --> 0:18:53,939
that the Dúnedain fall at last,


203
0:18:53,939 --> 0:18:56,276
never to rise again.


204
0:18:56,276 --> 0:20:1,996
Let them have what happiness they may!


205
0:20:1,996 --> 0:20:3,866
You're late!


206
0:20:3,866 --> 0:20:5,261
Where are the others?


207
0:20:5,261 --> 0:20:6,262
Slaughtered!


208
0:20:6,262 --> 0:20:7,263
We were ambushed,


209
0:20:7,263 --> 0:20:9,571
there are Ghostmen everywhere!


210
0:20:9,571 --> 0:20:11,5
They are not ghosts!


211
0:20:11,5 --> 0:20:13,237
Merely Rangers, you coward.


212
0:20:13,237 --> 0:20:16,68
You're as bad as these two!


213
0:20:16,68 --> 0:20:29,186
Did you get it?


214
0:20:29,186 --> 0:20:30,523
These are useless.


215
0:20:30,523 --> 0:20:35,143
You still have not found the ring that Sauron is seeking.


216
0:20:35,143 --> 0:20:37,264
Go back! Find it!


217
0:20:37,264 --> 0:20:39,887
How? There is not enough of us left.


218
0:20:39,887 --> 0:20:42,311
We need time to increase our numbers.


219
0:20:42,311 --> 0:20:50,386
It was a mistake to attack the ghostmen out of the darkness, Shaknar!


220
0:20:50,386 --> 0:21:0,36
I do not make mistakes!


221
0:21:0,36 --> 0:21:6,64
I go now to report your failer to Sauron at Dol Guldur.


222
0:21:6,64 --> 0:21:11,281
Increase your numbers if you must, but send out your spies.


223
0:21:11,281 --> 0:21:20,51
When I return I want to know where he is!


224
0:21:20,51 --> 0:21:21,37
What is it?


225
0:21:21,37 --> 0:21:23,5
I smell manflesh.


226
0:21:23,5 --> 0:21:24,514
That's impossible.


227
0:21:24,514 --> 0:22:7,961
Can't you smell it?


228
0:22:7,961 --> 0:22:12,71
Arathorn!  You're back!


229
0:22:12,71 --> 0:22:14,649
You should not come this far into the forest alone!


230
0:22:14,649 --> 0:22:39,789
I know.  I…


231
0:22:39,789 --> 0:22:42,816
Rangers.  Will you not go to them?


232
0:22:42,816 --> 0:22:45,48
They'll find us soon enough.


233
0:22:45,48 --> 0:22:48,59
So, I must hurry,


234
0:22:48,59 --> 0:22:50,521
or miss my chance.


235
0:22:50,521 --> 0:23:3,301
For what?


236
0:23:3,301 --> 0:23:14,832
I hope they take their time.


237
0:23:14,832 --> 0:23:20,972
I train them too well.


238
0:23:20,972 --> 0:23:28,456
My lord?


239
0:23:28,456 --> 0:23:31,734
I wandered too far from the village.


240
0:23:31,734 --> 0:23:35,533
But your captain found me.


241
0:23:35,533 --> 0:23:38,737
I am at your service, my lord.


242
0:23:38,737 --> 0:23:42,904
I shall always be at yours.


243
0:23:42,904 --> 0:23:45,818
Halbaron, escort the Lady Gilraen back to the village.


244
0:23:45,818 --> 0:23:55,904
At once, my lord.


245
0:23:55,904 --> 0:24:4,473
Elgarain.  A word.


246
0:24:4,473 --> 0:24:5,437
I'm sorry, my lord.


247
0:24:5,437 --> 0:24:7,666
We could not find you. I did not know...


248
0:24:7,666 --> 0:24:13,34
No apology necessary, my friend.


249
0:24:13,34 --> 0:24:16,314
Have you ever been in love?


250
0:24:16,314 --> 0:24:18,97
No.


251
0:24:18,97 --> 0:24:20,34
It changes your world.


252
0:24:20,34 --> 0:24:22,798
Consumes it with a burning flame


253
0:24:22,798 --> 0:24:25,187
that does not abate.


254
0:24:25,187 --> 0:24:28,859
A light as brilliant and piercing as Eärendil's star.


255
0:24:28,859 --> 0:24:31,299
You have been in love.


256
0:24:31,299 --> 0:24:46,227
I have heard it talked of.


257
0:24:46,227 --> 0:24:49,11
So you are in love?


258
0:24:49,11 --> 0:24:51,91
I am to be wed!


259
0:24:51,91 --> 0:24:53,26
Or I hope to be.


260
0:24:53,26 --> 0:24:55,294
And soon if fortune is with me.


261
0:24:55,294 --> 0:24:59,622
I wish you joy, my lord.


262
0:24:59,622 --> 0:25:3,69
Your heart should be filled with joy, Arathorn.


263
0:25:3,69 --> 0:25:4,837
Oh, it is...


264
0:25:4,837 --> 0:25:9,509
yet I fear that Lord Dírhael will not willingly give his blessing...


265
0:25:9,509 --> 0:25:13,594
Gilraen is, like you, not yet of age.


266
0:25:13,594 --> 0:25:16,954
I may not have known love,


267
0:25:16,954 --> 0:25:19,149
but I do know that when the heart would command the tongue


268
0:25:19,149 --> 0:25:22,587
no man should stand in the way...


269
0:25:22,587 --> 0:25:28,58
if you delay you may find that what should have been spoken


270
0:25:28,58 --> 0:25:31,121
is forever locked in your heart,


271
0:25:31,121 --> 0:25:34,755
and regret your only companion.


272
0:25:34,755 --> 0:25:36,849
Your words are wise…


273
0:25:36,849 --> 0:25:39,178
still…


274
0:25:39,178 --> 0:25:41,69
The seasons are changing.


275
0:25:41,69 --> 0:25:44,737
Maybe it will bring a change to his heart too.


276
0:25:44,737 --> 0:25:47,506
If it changes with the seasons,


277
0:25:47,506 --> 0:25:53,116
it can only grow colder.


278
0:25:53,116 --> 0:25:57,661
Just hold your ground and speak your heart.


279
0:25:57,661 --> 0:25:59,941
Thank you.


280
0:25:59,941 --> 0:26:1,959
You're a good friend to me.


281
0:26:1,959 --> 0:26:4,918
I would lay down my very life for you.


282
0:26:4,918 --> 0:26:29,123
And I for you.


283
0:26:29,123 --> 0:26:31,187
I am glad you're safe, my son.


284
0:26:31,187 --> 0:26:32,57
You also father.


285
0:26:32,57 --> 0:26:34,594
Halbaron tells me that your campaign against


286
0:26:34,594 --> 0:26:36,799
the orcs has been a success.


287
0:26:36,799 --> 0:26:39,659
Their numbers are indeed few now.


288
0:26:39,659 --> 0:26:43,493
They should not trouble us for some time.


289
0:26:43,493 --> 0:26:45,911
Yet your mind is not at ease.


290
0:26:45,911 --> 0:26:48,563
I now know what they're after,


291
0:26:48,563 --> 0:26:51,798
and that they do not act alone.


292
0:26:51,798 --> 0:26:53,552
They are servants of Sauron,


293
0:26:53,552 --> 0:26:57,374
and he seeks the Ring of Barahir.


294
0:26:57,374 --> 0:27:0,319
Father, they are hunting for you.


295
0:27:0,319 --> 0:27:2,71
It is as I feared then.


296
0:27:2,71 --> 0:27:4,187
I beg you to hide the ring.


297
0:27:4,187 --> 0:27:5,721
Do not wear it!


298
0:27:5,721 --> 0:27:7,38
No.


299
0:27:7,38 --> 0:27:9,77
But it will lead them straight to you!


300
0:27:9,77 --> 0:27:12,61
Let Sauron send all the armies in this world against us.


301
0:27:12,61 --> 0:27:15,675
I will not hide from who I am,


302
0:27:15,675 --> 0:27:17,211
while I have a breath in my body,


303
0:27:17,211 --> 0:27:18,434
and a sword in my hand.


304
0:27:18,434 --> 0:27:20,106
Forgive me.


305
0:27:20,106 --> 0:27:22,617
There is nothing to forgive, my son.


306
0:27:22,617 --> 0:27:25,971
You have been of great service to me, and the Dúnedain.


307
0:27:25,971 --> 0:27:32,23
You are a true heir of kings!


308
0:27:32,23 --> 0:27:37,959
Come now, do not be troubled.


309
0:27:37,959 --> 0:27:41,283
Your mother used to remind me


310
0:27:41,283 --> 0:27:43,79
that the people look upon us for guidance,


311
0:27:43,79 --> 0:27:47,539
that we had to stand fast, no matter what.


312
0:27:47,539 --> 0:27:50,94
Perhaps one day


313
0:27:50,94 --> 0:27:53,67
you will find someone with as much wisdom and beauty,


314
0:27:53,67 --> 0:28:0,172
to counsel you.


315
0:28:0,172 --> 0:28:4,218
You have my blessing, my children.


316
0:28:4,218 --> 0:28:7,416
May your days be long and fruitful,


317
0:28:7,416 --> 0:28:16,4
and filled with hope.


318
0:28:16,4 --> 0:28:18,466
I go now to Rivendell,


319
0:28:18,466 --> 0:28:21,464
where Elrond Halfelven awaits me.


320
0:28:21,464 --> 0:28:24,201
When I return with his good counsel,


321
0:28:24,201 --> 0:28:30,44
then perhaps we shall have a wedding.


322
0:28:30,44 --> 0:28:49,22
Good luck with Dírhael.


323
0:28:49,22 --> 0:28:58,936
Lord Dírhael...


324
0:28:58,936 --> 0:29:6,789
good morning.


325
0:29:6,789 --> 0:29:9,385
Through the long winter months


326
0:29:9,385 --> 0:29:12,327
the warmth in Arathorn's heart


327
0:29:12,327 --> 0:29:14,263
was only held at bay


328
0:29:14,263 --> 0:29:24,152
by his fear of failing his most important task.


329
0:29:24,152 --> 0:29:25,696
Just hold your ground,


330
0:29:25,696 --> 0:29:53,429
and speak your heart.


331
0:29:53,429 --> 0:29:57,986
Lord Dírhael.


332
0:29:57,986 --> 0:30:0,954
I have come to ask for your daughter's hand in marriage.


333
0:30:0,954 --> 0:30:3,86
I owe you my life, son of Arador.


334
0:30:3,86 --> 0:30:6,937
But I do not owe you my daughter.


335
0:30:6,937 --> 0:30:9,556
But I love her, my lord.


336
0:30:9,556 --> 0:30:11,12
I fear deeply the shadow


337
0:30:11,12 --> 0:30:14,236
you cast on my house, Isildur's Heir.


338
0:30:14,236 --> 0:30:16,249
The attention you show my daughter is unwelcome...


339
0:30:16,249 --> 0:30:18,76
By you.


340
0:30:18,76 --> 0:30:19,549
Not by her.


341
0:30:19,549 --> 0:30:25,16
Yes.  Therefore it cannot be ignored.


342
0:30:25,16 --> 0:30:26,897
I hope for Gilraen's sake


343
0:30:26,897 --> 0:30:29,936
your father's blood flows through your veins.


344
0:30:29,936 --> 0:30:31,963
If you fail your people,


345
0:30:31,963 --> 0:30:35,755
you will have only the Dúnedain to answer to.


346
0:30:35,755 --> 0:30:38,38
If you fail her,


347
0:30:38,38 --> 0:30:47,302
it is me to whom you'll answer.


348
0:30:47,302 --> 0:30:53,921
Was that a yes?


349
0:30:53,921 --> 0:30:57,997
And when Winter had withdrawn it's cold fingers from the land


350
0:30:57,997 --> 0:31:1,94
and passed into bright and early Spring.


351
0:31:1,94 --> 0:31:5,597
Arathorn, son of Arador


352
0:31:5,597 --> 0:31:9,69
and the Lady Gilraen were wed,


353
0:31:9,69 --> 0:32:18,609
in happiness and hope.


354
0:32:18,609 --> 0:32:21,441
But after only a year of joy,


355
0:32:21,441 --> 0:32:26,83
a dark shadow crept back into their lives.


356
0:32:26,83 --> 0:32:29,363
Arador, son of Argonui,


357
0:32:29,363 --> 0:32:34,97
Lord of the Dúnedain, found himself in a shallow dell


358
0:32:34,97 --> 0:33:6,95
amid the chill, blinding vapours of the Coldfells.


359
0:33:6,95 --> 0:33:9,57
Run!


360
0:33:9,57 --> 0:33:15,616
Run!


361
0:33:15,616 --> 0:33:16,975
Where's my father?


362
0:33:16,975 --> 0:33:17,939
He's further South.


363
0:33:17,939 --> 0:33:55,91
Go!


364
0:33:55,91 --> 0:34:0,472
Father!


365
0:34:0,472 --> 0:34:11,923
Father.


366
0:34:11,923 --> 0:34:14,398
Arathorn!  Arathorn!  Awake!


367
0:34:14,398 --> 0:34:16,319
It is nought but a dream!  Awake!


368
0:34:16,319 --> 0:34:20,841
No!  I saw him!  I felt the breath leave him!


369
0:34:20,841 --> 0:34:24,465
Shhh!  It's but a dream.  A dream!


370
0:34:24,465 --> 0:34:30,17
Oh, Gilraen!  Would that it were!


371
0:34:30,17 --> 0:34:33,57
What hope is there for our people?


372
0:34:33,57 --> 0:34:36,527
The line of the Kings hangs by a thread,


373
0:34:36,527 --> 0:34:40,312
I fear it's going to find its bitter end in me.


374
0:34:40,312 --> 0:34:44,725
Arathorn, where is your joy?


375
0:34:44,725 --> 0:34:47,394
Where is your hope?


376
0:34:47,394 --> 0:34:49,598
I will not despair!


377
0:34:49,598 --> 0:34:53,108
Nor would I have you do so.


378
0:34:53,108 --> 0:34:55,367
Arathorn, look at me!


379
0:34:55,367 --> 0:34:57,402
Fear not tomorrow,


380
0:34:57,402 --> 0:35:1,69
for it is not ours to know or to command.


381
0:35:1,69 --> 0:35:5,801
And do not fear that the royal house has reached its end.


382
0:35:5,801 --> 0:35:8,569
It is alive.


383
0:35:8,569 --> 0:35:12,41
In you.


384
0:35:12,41 --> 0:35:20,853
And in me.


385
0:35:20,853 --> 0:35:23,881
There is my Hope.


386
0:35:23,881 --> 0:35:27,198
So a year after the lose of his father


387
0:35:27,198 --> 0:35:31,355
on the first day of the third month


388
0:35:31,355 --> 0:35:37,607
Arathorn and the Dúnedain welcomed into the world new hope.


389
0:35:37,607 --> 0:35:39,864
You have a son my lord.


390
0:35:39,864 --> 0:35:41,932
We will name him, Aragorn.


391
0:35:41,932 --> 0:35:46,627
Kingly Valour, that he shall have,


392
0:35:46,627 --> 0:35:49,91
but on his breast I see a green stone,


393
0:35:49,91 --> 0:35:52,548
and from that his true name shall come


394
0:35:52,548 --> 0:35:54,958
and his chief renown


395
0:35:54,958 --> 0:36:7,781
for he shall be a healer and a renewer.


396
0:36:7,781 --> 0:36:9,482
Behold Aragorn,


397
0:36:9,482 --> 0:36:10,938
son of Arathorn,


398
0:36:10,938 --> 0:36:12,473
Lord of the Dúnedain!


399
0:36:12,473 --> 0:36:15,385
Scion of Elendil of Númenor!


400
0:36:15,385 --> 0:36:20,7
The Heir of Isildur!


401
0:36:20,7 --> 0:36:22,28
Hail Aragorn!


402
0:36:22,28 --> 0:36:26,37
Hail Aragorn!


403
0:36:26,37 --> 0:36:29,481
By the valour of the Lord and his Rangers,


404
0:36:29,481 --> 0:36:33,13
the Dúnedain had a measure of peace.


405
0:36:33,13 --> 0:36:51,882
And the child Aragorn grew swiftly and happily.


406
0:36:51,882 --> 0:36:57,913
Halbaron


407
0:36:57,913 --> 0:37:0,373
Seems but yesterday that your son Halbarad


408
0:37:0,373 --> 0:37:1,618
was Aragorn's age.


409
0:37:1,618 --> 0:37:4,29
It does indeed, my lord.


410
0:37:4,29 --> 0:37:6,14
I imagine it'll seem the same, Evonyn,


411
0:37:6,14 --> 0:37:8,586
when our son is a man.


412
0:37:8,586 --> 0:37:10,653
That it will, my lady.


413
0:37:10,653 --> 0:37:12,334
How quickly they grow!


414
0:37:12,334 --> 0:37:13,742
And how much they eat to get there!


415
0:37:13,742 --> 0:37:27,378
If there's anything left!


416
0:37:27,378 --> 0:37:34,335
I claim this field in the name of the King!


417
0:37:34,335 --> 0:37:36,893
Seven stars and a crown on a field of blue


418
0:37:36,893 --> 0:37:39,548
In the wind of war the banner flew


419
0:37:39,548 --> 0:37:42,188
Around it the King called men forth


420
0:37:42,188 --> 0:37:45,236
To fight for freedom in the North


421
0:37:45,236 --> 0:37:48,37
Fornost has fallen the herald cried


422
0:37:48,37 --> 0:37:50,66
As Dúnedain they fought and they died


423
0:37:50,66 --> 0:37:53,744
A man noble and brave fell from his steed


424
0:37:53,744 --> 0:37:57,253
Trampled by beasts that gave no heed


425
0:37:57,253 --> 0:37:59,3
The king was carried from the fray


426
0:37:59,3 --> 0:38:2,68
As the army of Angmar made its way


427
0:38:2,68 --> 0:38:4,525
Our banner caught in a sea of death


428
0:38:4,525 --> 0:38:7,56
As the king’s herald drew one last breath


429
0:38:7,56 --> 0:38:9,904
The banner toppled and fell to the Earth


430
0:38:9,904 --> 0:38:13,92
The enemy howled in terrible mirth


431
0:38:13,92 --> 0:38:16,786
As men ran in fear and cried


432
0:38:16,786 --> 0:38:21,839
The Lords Elladan and Elrohir of Rivendell arrived unlooked for,


433
0:38:21,839 --> 0:38:25,111
and wished to speak with us at once.


434
0:38:25,111 --> 0:38:26,394
Welcome, friends!


435
0:38:26,394 --> 0:38:28,378
What brings you to us this night?


436
0:38:28,378 --> 0:38:29,92
And how fares your father Lord Elrond?


437
0:38:29,92 --> 0:38:31,169
And the Lady Arwen?


438
0:38:31,169 --> 0:38:33,913
Our father and sister are well, my lord.


439
0:38:33,913 --> 0:38:36,944
It was Elrond who sent us hither in haste.


440
0:38:36,944 --> 0:38:40,52
Orcs are increasing North and East of Taurdal.


441
0:38:40,52 --> 0:38:44,264
Their numbers are greater than have been seen in many years.


442
0:38:44,264 --> 0:38:45,996
Even now they move relentlessly toward


443
0:38:45,996 --> 0:38:48,164
the northernmost villages of the Dúnedain.


444
0:38:48,164 --> 0:38:49,416
It will not be long before danger


445
0:38:49,416 --> 0:38:52,801
presses once more on your borders.


446
0:38:52,801 --> 0:38:54,859
To Rivendell where the boy doth lie


447
0:38:54,859 --> 0:39:4,975
And where the banner still flies on high.


448
0:39:4,975 --> 0:39:7,416
For this reason our father sends grave counsel.


449
0:39:7,416 --> 0:39:9,84
What is this counsel?


450
0:39:9,84 --> 0:39:10,59
He urges you to send your wife and son


451
0:39:10,59 --> 0:39:13,388
to Imladris for safekeeping,


452
0:39:13,388 --> 0:39:14,567
and for you, Arathorn,


453
0:39:14,567 --> 0:39:17,15
to lead the Dúnedain by secret ways to other lands,


454
0:39:17,15 --> 0:39:20,696
and flee this encroaching danger.


455
0:39:20,696 --> 0:39:24,124
It is late my lords, we will speak further in the morning,


456
0:39:24,124 --> 0:39:33,993
Let us find you somewhere to rest.


457
0:39:33,993 --> 0:39:36,588
Elrond Halfelven is wise,


458
0:39:36,588 --> 0:39:38,93
and sees much that is hidden


459
0:39:38,93 --> 0:39:41,155
or has yet to come to pass.


460
0:39:41,155 --> 0:39:42,665
I will consider his words,


461
0:39:42,665 --> 0:39:44,198
and take thought for my people.


462
0:39:44,198 --> 0:39:46,386
Let your decision be not long delayed.


463
0:39:46,386 --> 0:39:47,883
With every hour that passes,


464
0:39:47,883 --> 0:39:49,335
peril draws closer.


465
0:39:49,335 --> 0:39:54,439
I understand.  Rest well, my lords.


466
0:39:54,439 --> 0:40:0,81
Rest well.


467
0:40:0,81 --> 0:40:1,64
Do not say it!


468
0:40:1,64 --> 0:40:3,82
I will not be parted from you.


469
0:40:3,82 --> 0:40:6,946
Yet it is wise counsel.


470
0:40:6,946 --> 0:40:9,54
If danger closes in on us once again,


471
0:40:9,54 --> 0:40:13,374
you and Aragorn must be protected.


472
0:40:13,374 --> 0:40:17,786
All the Chieftains of the Dúnedain have been fostered for a time in Elrond's halls.


473
0:40:17,786 --> 0:40:19,922
I myself spent years there as a child.


474
0:40:19,922 --> 0:40:21,857
I will not leave you.


475
0:40:21,857 --> 0:40:51,329
I will not!


476
0:40:51,329 --> 0:40:53,989
We know where he is!


477
0:40:53,989 --> 0:40:55,544
Good.


478
0:40:55,544 --> 0:41:3,871
Come with me.


479
0:41:3,871 --> 0:41:6,86
Elgarain!


480
0:41:6,86 --> 0:41:8,22
Halbaron saw you leaving.


481
0:41:8,22 --> 0:41:10,938
Something I should have done a long time ago.


482
0:41:10,938 --> 0:41:16,705
Without goodbye?


483
0:41:16,705 --> 0:41:18,69
Ever since your father's death,


484
0:41:18,69 --> 0:41:22,471
I've made it my duty to look out for you.


485
0:41:22,471 --> 0:41:24,532
I owed it to him for his years of service,


486
0:41:24,532 --> 0:41:26,987
and his friendship.


487
0:41:26,987 --> 0:41:31,178
When you wanted to take his place, I alone supported you.


488
0:41:31,178 --> 0:41:34,434
For ten years you've been by my side,


489
0:41:34,434 --> 0:41:36,916
yet now, when I need you most,


490
0:41:36,916 --> 0:41:38,793
you would leave me?


491
0:41:38,793 --> 0:41:41,115
You need eyes and ears in distant lands,


492
0:41:41,115 --> 0:41:44,6
and the Ranger post at Hithlin is unmanned.


493
0:41:44,6 --> 0:41:45,45
Hithlin?


494
0:41:45,45 --> 0:41:47,362
But it is so far!


495
0:41:47,362 --> 0:41:49,945
I release you from your duty.


496
0:41:49,945 --> 0:41:51,728
I will burden you no more.


497
0:41:51,728 --> 0:41:54,819
You have never been a burden.


498
0:41:54,819 --> 0:41:57,921
Elgarain, you have only ever been a friend.


499
0:41:57,921 --> 0:42:0,513
you're like a sister to me.


500
0:42:0,513 --> 0:42:2,84
You have a family.


501
0:42:2,84 --> 0:42:5,561
A wife and son who need you.


502
0:42:5,561 --> 0:42:8,98
Protect them.


503
0:42:8,98 --> 0:42:10,17
Do not bid me stay!


504
0:42:10,17 --> 0:42:14,513
Please.


505
0:42:14,513 --> 0:42:17,853
I will not hold you here if you wish to leave.


506
0:42:17,853 --> 0:42:20,577
But I do not understand.


507
0:42:20,577 --> 0:42:24,394
And for that reason, I cannot explain.


508
0:42:24,394 --> 0:42:27,33
Forgive me.


509
0:42:27,33 --> 0:42:32,39
Lord Arathorn!  Your counsel is needed.


510
0:42:32,39 --> 0:42:42,293
Arathorn.  The Enemy is on the move!


511
0:42:42,293 --> 0:42:56,463
Safe journey, my friend.


512
0:42:56,463 --> 0:42:59,393
My Lord.  The orcs are on the move.


513
0:42:59,393 --> 0:43:1,993
Lord Elrohir bid me to say this:


514
0:43:1,993 --> 0:43:12,317
"The decision has been made for you."


515
0:43:12,317 --> 0:43:14,673
Call my captains to me.


516
0:43:14,673 --> 0:43:42,455
War is at hand!


517
0:43:42,455 --> 0:43:45,617
Well met my friend.


518
0:43:45,617 --> 0:43:50,14
It is time.


519
0:43:50,14 --> 0:43:53,83
But while the Lord of the Dúnedain


520
0:43:53,83 --> 0:43:57,182
and the Sons of Elrond laid their plans,


521
0:43:57,182 --> 0:44:1,301
the orcs, by stealth and cunning,


522
0:44:1,301 --> 0:44:6,147
were nearer to the village than even Lord Elrond had foreseen.


523
0:44:6,147 --> 0:44:8,736
Did you not forget something?


524
0:44:8,736 --> 0:44:11,21
What would I have forgotten?


525
0:44:11,21 --> 0:44:14,131
To tell me you were leaving.


526
0:44:14,131 --> 0:44:17,3
Lord Arathorn needs our help.


527
0:44:17,3 --> 0:44:18,917
Yet whether he rides to Rivendell


528
0:44:18,917 --> 0:44:22,439
or leads the Dúnedain to safety elsewhere,


529
0:44:22,439 --> 0:44:26,144
you will not stay.


530
0:44:26,144 --> 0:44:28,864
I cannot.


531
0:44:28,864 --> 0:44:31,161
I see that now.


532
0:44:31,161 --> 0:44:33,376
I go to free my heart of him.


533
0:44:33,376 --> 0:44:34,89
Would you not welcome such news?


534
0:44:34,89 --> 0:44:37,362
Indeed I would.


535
0:44:37,362 --> 0:44:40,198
For you are ever in my thoughts.


536
0:44:40,198 --> 0:44:43,791
Did you never know or guess this?


537
0:44:43,791 --> 0:44:46,9
You've always been kind to me.


538
0:44:46,9 --> 0:44:50,714
Kind?


539
0:44:50,714 --> 0:44:56,666
No, Elgarain.


540
0:44:56,666 --> 0:44:57,907
I love you.


541
0:44:57,907 --> 0:45:0,467
I have done for years.


542
0:45:0,467 --> 0:45:3,199
When you knew I loved another?  Why?


543
0:45:3,199 --> 0:45:8,923
Because in time I knew you would be wise enough to let him go.


544
0:45:8,923 --> 0:45:10,488
And now I have.


545
0:45:10,488 --> 0:45:17,628
Only to run from me.


546
0:45:17,628 --> 0:45:40,812
El, do not run.


547
0:45:40,812 --> 0:45:50,588
Come with me.


548
0:45:50,588 --> 0:46:3,776
I will.


549
0:46:3,776 --> 0:46:5,289
Elgarain!  Flee!


550
0:46:5,289 --> 0:46:7,974
You cannot hold them off alone!


551
0:46:7,974 --> 0:46:9,433
Hurry, warn the village!


552
0:46:9,433 --> 0:46:10,323
No!


553
0:46:10,323 --> 0:46:11,348
You must warn them,


554
0:46:11,348 --> 0:46:13,388
for the Dúnedain


555
0:46:13,388 --> 0:46:15,541
go!


556
0:46:15,541 --> 0:46:30,557
We will see each other again! Go!


557
0:46:30,557 --> 0:46:33,194
My lords. My lords!


558
0:46:33,194 --> 0:46:37,797
We shall not wait for the orcs to make their advance.


559
0:46:37,797 --> 0:46:40,346
We will evacuate the villages,


560
0:46:40,346 --> 0:46:42,922
but we will bring war to them in the Wilds,


561
0:46:42,922 --> 0:46:44,558
wherever they may be.


562
0:46:44,558 --> 0:46:46,343
So let the servants of Evil beware!


563
0:46:46,343 --> 0:46:48,113
To arms! To arms!


564
0:46:48,113 --> 0:46:52,763
To arms! To arms!


565
0:46:52,763 --> 0:47:2,557
Halbaron!  Our enemy is upon us!


566
0:47:2,557 --> 0:47:13,875
The forest… Dírhaborn… fights to delay them… orcs everywhere!


567
0:47:13,875 --> 0:47:33,257
Rangers, to me!


568
0:47:33,257 --> 0:47:35,487
Are you injured?


569
0:47:35,487 --> 0:47:37,249
No.


570
0:47:37,249 --> 0:47:51,226
Gilraen, where is your son? Where is Aragorn?


571
0:47:51,226 --> 0:48:2,996
Aragorn!?


572
0:48:2,996 --> 0:48:42,934
Go to the Hall!


573
0:48:42,934 --> 0:49:24,418
Arathorn! Fall back, fall back!


574
0:49:24,418 --> 0:49:28,218
There! He's the one!


575
0:49:28,218 --> 0:49:31,645
Behold your fate.


576
0:49:31,645 --> 0:49:59,755
Your house has ended!


577
0:49:59,755 --> 0:50:5,779
Papa... Papa, papa!?


578
0:50:5,779 --> 0:50:53,877
Two dogs must die today!


579
0:50:53,877 --> 0:51:2,901
Gilraen!


580
0:51:2,901 --> 0:51:4,357
My lady, go inside!


581
0:51:4,357 --> 0:51:30,559
I will not leave you!


582
0:51:30,559 --> 0:52:19,333
Papa, papa!


583
0:52:19,333 --> 0:52:22,373
The Dúnedain prevailed.


584
0:52:22,373 --> 0:52:47,725
But a heavy price was paid for their victory.


585
0:52:47,725 --> 0:52:50,555
Forgive me.


586
0:52:50,555 --> 0:52:52,682
For what?


587
0:52:52,682 --> 0:52:56,298
For my envy…


588
0:52:56,298 --> 0:53:0,533
because he chose you.


589
0:53:0,533 --> 0:53:12,574
Elgarain!


590
0:53:12,574 --> 0:53:14,77
Arathorn, I...


591
0:53:14,77 --> 0:53:18,59
Save your strength my friend.


592
0:53:18,59 --> 0:53:20,841
I failed you.


593
0:53:20,841 --> 0:53:23,782
No.  No, you did not.


594
0:53:23,782 --> 0:53:27,383
My family is safe because of you.


595
0:53:27,383 --> 0:53:39,59
Your father would be so proud.


596
0:53:39,59 --> 0:53:45,3
I found my heart today.


597
0:53:45,3 --> 0:53:47,235
And now it is lost...


598
0:53:47,235 --> 0:53:53,866
He was leaving with you?


599
0:53:53,866 --> 0:54:4,737
I will not lose it all.


600
0:54:4,737 --> 0:54:9,784
You must live.


601
0:54:9,784 --> 0:54:14,503
And Aragorn must live.


602
0:54:14,503 --> 0:54:31,46
We cannot lose our hope!


603
0:54:31,46 --> 0:54:33,945
Elgarain.


604
0:54:33,945 --> 0:54:51,952
Elgarain!


605
0:54:51,952 --> 0:54:55,721
How many more must fall?


606
0:54:55,721 --> 0:54:59,31
How many?!


607
0:54:59,31 --> 0:55:3,744
Too long the servants of evil have ravaged our people


608
0:55:3,744 --> 0:55:19,563
and this once-proud Kingdom of Arnor.


609
0:55:19,563 --> 0:55:22,665
Men of the West!


610
0:55:22,665 --> 0:55:24,83
The Shadow grows longer,


611
0:55:24,83 --> 0:55:28,639
and its cruel arm reaches ever toward us.


612
0:55:28,639 --> 0:55:33,277
But we cannot lose hope.


613
0:55:33,277 --> 0:55:37,499
A time will come when the Dúnedain regain their strength,


614
0:55:37,499 --> 0:55:41,229
and banish evil from these lands forever.


615
0:55:41,229 --> 0:55:43,888
Until then,


616
0:55:43,888 --> 0:55:50,87
we have a duty to safe guard our people at all cost.


617
0:55:50,87 --> 0:55:54,193
So, arise, Dúnedain!


618
0:55:54,193 --> 0:55:56,506
Remember who you are!


619
0:55:56,506 --> 0:55:59,973
Let our enemies once again flee before us!


620
0:55:59,973 --> 0:56:5,233
And let no orc leave this forest alive!


621
0:56:5,233 --> 0:56:15,385
Gather your rangers. You men with me!


622
0:56:15,385 --> 0:56:30,37
I will come back to you.  I promise.


623
0:56:30,37 --> 0:56:34,73
Then Arathorn, son of Arador,


624
0:56:34,73 --> 0:56:37,961
Lord of the Dúnedain,


625
0:56:37,961 --> 0:56:43,766
led his people in a great and valiant onslaught,


626
0:56:43,766 --> 0:57:30,149
and the servants of the Enemy quailed.


627
0:57:30,149 --> 0:59:55,689
Arathorn, wait!


628
0:59:55,689 --> 1:0:4,43
Now the line of Kings ends!


629
1:0:4,43 --> 1:0:6,535
The line is not broken.


630
1:0:6,535 --> 1:0:56,21
There is still hope!


631
1:0:56,21 --> 1:0:59,583
They will return, Gilraen.


632
1:0:59,583 --> 1:1:4,811
They will.


633
1:1:4,811 --> 1:1:7,876
Lady Gilraen!  Lady Gilraen!


634
1:1:7,876 --> 1:1:24,942
Lord Arathorn is hurt!


635
1:1:24,942 --> 1:1:26,368
Has he spoken?


636
1:1:26,368 --> 1:1:32,679
Only your name, my lady.


637
1:1:32,679 --> 1:1:34,486
Gilraen?


638
1:1:34,486 --> 1:1:40,753
I'm here.  I'm here!


639
1:1:40,753 --> 1:1:46,746
Here is my joy.


640
1:1:46,746 --> 1:1:50,214
And there is our hope.


641
1:1:50,214 --> 1:2:48,375
Aragorn, Chieftain of the Dúnedain!


642
1:2:48,375 --> 1:2:53,868
Then the Lady of the Dúnedain bid farewell to her kin,


643
1:2:53,868 --> 1:2:56,805
and to all her people,


644
1:2:56,805 --> 1:3:0,868
for to protect the last children of Númenor


645
1:3:0,868 --> 1:3:4,565
she bid Halbaron disband Taurdal


646
1:3:4,565 --> 1:3:10,141
and the Dúnedain to find safety in small secret settlements


647
1:3:10,141 --> 1:3:48,562
in the depths of the forests of Rhudaur.


648
1:3:48,562 --> 1:3:52,533
The Heir of Isildur was brought to Rivendell


649
1:3:52,533 --> 1:3:57,72
for his fostering and safekeeping.


650
1:3:57,72 --> 1:4:4,827
And that is how you are come here to Master Elrond's house, little one.


651
1:4:4,827 --> 1:4:9,555
I will not for many long years call you Aragorn.


652
1:4:9,555 --> 1:4:12,483
For your name must be forgotten.


653
1:4:12,483 --> 1:4:16,3
Less the enemy learn you live


654
1:4:16,3 --> 1:4:19,992
and all we fought for is lost.


655
1:4:19,992 --> 1:4:24,75
For the last time then.


656
1:4:24,75 --> 1:4:27,532
You are Aragorn,


657
1:4:27,532 --> 1:4:30,532
Son of Arathorn,


658
1:4:30,532 --> 1:4:32,482
Chieftain of the Dúnedain


659
1:4:32,482 --> 1:4:37,347
and the Heir of Isildur.


660
1:4:37,347 --> 1:4:39,707
But for now,


661
1:4:39,707 --> 1:4:43,75
Estel,


662
1:4:43,75 --> 1:6:43,75
you are simply our Hope.
