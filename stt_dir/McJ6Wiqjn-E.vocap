###0 now we told you before about wilcox county high school in
###4 and this is amazing situation where they have segregated props
###8 they have a vote
###10 white primal
###11 that sounds like a mile and must have it in nineteen sixty nine or
###15 or maybe there are other than that nineteen forty nine
###17 now it's happening today inside a biracial student trying to show of last
###21 year
###22 i was kicked out escorted away by the police and the police and forces now
###27 it's not suddenly run by this as students is run by a parent organization
###31 but the cops in force it
###34 four students came together so that we should do and integrated prom it's
###38 twenty thirteen
###39 can we set out of the time machine for a second
###42 and get real here
###44 uh... it turns out a lot of people are resisting this including the governor of
###48 georgia i'll get to in a second but for c_b_s_ us to the school
###52 akamai university journalists went there as reported back wall
###56 white students in the back during class wake
###59 uh... while black kids in the front
###61 lots of interesting
###62 change of pace
###63 mistakes which positions
###64 black kids have lunch outside while the white kids have there is in the yard
###68 white students particularly girls who deep black students recipient ostracized
###73 emboli
###74 now look
###75 either way since the blacks in sometime soon apart a lot of different schools
###79 but there seems to be something that is enforced throughout all these decades
###82 and we know
###83 if you're black or even biracial each other show up to that problem
###86 it take you out
###87 so there's no question about that's the case here
###92 is a people fighting bag yes and now whose small credit by the way position
###96 be fairly obvious
###98 or trying to fix the situation
###100 and there are seven uh... people some of the georgia state representatives formed
###104 president truman republicans who are saying
###108 misfortune places
###110 amman but what of the president was not among them
###113 is governor mason deal of george
###117 is a man you see pictured here
###120 when asked about this
###122 he said the groups trying to integrate the races in that high school are quote
###128 a leftist font group
###130 for the state democratic board
###133 okay you know what nathan
###135 fine you would
###136 democrats are for integration republicans
###140 segregation in the year twenty thirty began to be fair not all republicans
###144 even george arsenal state reps are against us
###148 apparently have some sense that nathan deal doesn't but look at this time warp
###152 is stuck in that time
###153 this guy some things like our budget leftist more than that it is coming in
###157 here china integrators
###159 the racist to your magic
###161 and the same for all
###163 he's not done yet he says quote
###165 we're not going to lend a hand to this silly publicity stuff
###172 this silly publicity stunt
###174 trying to integrate the races in georgia however here
###178 every time we knew the story would be another twice
###182 first original story now the hopi with nathan deal
###185 can't believe it's the year twenty thirteen and these guys still think this
###189 way
###190 has probably cuz i'm way to ninety
###193 fighting grew up in a situation like that
###195 so when i see this a government united states state this day and age saying how
###200 you and your publicity stunts
###203 with your left this don't strive integrate the races
###206 unacceptable
###207 i'm shocked by it
###209 i hope to it
###210 voters in georgia rashad by and they never make the mistake of reelected
###214 nathan deal again
