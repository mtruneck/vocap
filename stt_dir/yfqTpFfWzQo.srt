1
0:0:1,1 --> 0:0:5,849
THANK YOU. WHAT IN THE WORLD ARE WE GOING



2
0:0:5,849 --> 0:0:6,26
TO HAVE TIME FOR?


3
0:0:6,26 --> 0:0:19,18
OKAY. WELL, YOU KNOW, SOME OF THE MATERIAL
I'M PRESENTING


4
0:0:19,18 --> 0:0:25,41
TODAY. FRANKLY, DOESN'T NEED TO COME ACROSS
IN THE ECOLOGY


5
0:0:25,41 --> 0:0:31,34
SECTION BECAUSE A BIG PART OF WHAT I'M PRESENTING
TODAY


6
0:0:31,34 --> 0:0:37,19
IS ETHOLOGY. THE SCIENCE OF ANIMAL BEHAVIOR.
I'M PRESENTING


7
0:0:37,19 --> 0:0:43,96
IT HERE IN ECOLOGY BECAUSE I DO THINK IT FITS.
AND I THINK THE


8
0:0:43,96 --> 0:0:49,199
LINK BETWEEN ETHOLOGY AND ECOLOGY CAN BE MADE
STRONGER AND


9
0:0:49,199 --> 0:0:54,6
WILL BE MADE STRONGER IN COMING YEARS. BUT
ALSO, YOU DON'T GET


10
0:0:54,6 --> 0:1:0,199
ETHOLOGY IN ANY OTHER PLACE IN THIS COURSE
OR REALLY IT'S HARD TO


11
0:1:0,199 --> 0:1:3,119
GET IN AN INTRODUCTORY COURSE IN THE DEPARTMENT.
WE'VE GOOD


12
0:1:3,119 --> 0:1:7,11
ADVANCED COURSES IN IT. SO I THOUGHT IT WAS
IMPORTANT TO BRING IN.


13
0:1:7,11 --> 0:1:17,69
BUT I CANNOT CUT BACK ON IT AND THAT IS SOME
OF WHAT GOES TODAY.


14
0:1:17,69 --> 0:1:20,57
I'M GOING TO START BY LOOKING AT THE LEVELS
OF ORGANIZATION


15
0:1:20,57 --> 0:1:24,18
CONCEPT. IT'S THIS ORIENTING GENERALIZATION
THAT'S USED IN


16
0:1:24,18 --> 0:1:29,66
BIOLOGY FOR DEMARCATING THE BOUNDARIES BETWEEN
FIELDS OR


17
0:1:29,66 --> 0:1:32,92
DEMARCATING BOUNDARIES BETWEEN NATURAL PHENOMENON
OF THINGS WE


18
0:1:32,92 --> 0:1:39,16
STUDY. WE'LL GO OVER THAT FIRST. AND THEN
LOOK AT THE FIELD OF


19
0:1:39,16 --> 0:1:46,3
ETHOLOGY. I TEND TO STUDY ANIMALS MORE THAN
I STUDY PLANTS SO


20
0:1:46,3 --> 0:1:52,96
YOU GET A BIAS FROM ME TOWARD ANIMALS. BIO
1B HAS BEEN BIASED TOWARD PLANTS AND


21
0:1:52,96 --> 0:1:54,22
I'LL TRY NOT TO MAKE NOT TO MAKE


22
0:1:54,22 --> 0:1:59,659
APOLOGIES FOR MY OWN BIAS TOWARD ANIMAL. A
LOT OF EXAMPLES YOU'LL GET ARE


23
0:1:59,659 --> 0:2:6,94
FROM ANIMALS. ETHOLOGY THE SCIENCE OF INDIVIDUAL
BEHAVIOR, OR


24
0:2:6,94 --> 0:2:10,379
THE SCIENCE OF ANIMAL BEHAVIOR IS REALLY FOCUSED
ON ANIMALS


25
0:2:10,379 --> 0:2:14,769
BECAUSE BEHAVIOR REALLY, ANIMALS ARE OUTWARDLY
MUCH MORE


26
0:2:14,769 --> 0:2:19,95
COMPLEX THAN PLANTS ARE. YOU CAN SPEAK OF
PLANT BEHAVIOR OF THE


27
0:2:19,95 --> 0:2:23,579
EXTERNAL ACTIVITY OF A PLANT. THAT'S IT'S
BEHAVIOR IF YOU


28
0:2:23,579 --> 0:2:23,579



29
0:2:23,579 --> 0:2:27,829
DEFINE BEHAVIOR IN THAT WAY. BUT REALLY ETHOLOGY
IS THE FIELD


30
0:2:27,829 --> 0:2:33,98
OF STUDY OF ANIMALS. WE'LL LOOK AT EXAMPLES,
TIME PERMITTING, OF LEARNING


31
0:2:33,98 --> 0:2:39,299
PROBLEM SOLVING COGNITION AND THEIR RELATIONSHIP
TO ECOLOGY. HOPEFULLY


32
0:2:39,299 --> 0:2:46,31
GETTING INTO SOME BEHAVIOR ECOLOGY AND OPTIMAL
ORIGIN, IDEAS AND


33
0:2:46,31 --> 0:2:50,709
FINISHING WITH THE ECOLOGY OF SOCIAL GROUPS.
I WILL MOVE BRISKLY TO TRY TO GET THROUGH


34
0:2:50,709 --> 0:2:51,59
THIS MATERIAL.


35
0:2:51,59 --> 0:2:57,15
A LOT OF IT IS JUST FUN, STICKING WITH THE
THEME OF TRYING NOT TO GO TOO FAST IN TERMS


36
0:2:57,15 --> 0:3:1,279
OF INFORMATION COVERED IN THE BEGINNING OF
THIS COURSE. SO LET'S


37
0:3:1,279 --> 0:3:5,459
JUST HAVE FUN AND LOOK AT PICTURES AND THINK
ABOUT THESE


38
0:3:5,459 --> 0:3:7,29
IDEAS.


39
0:3:7,29 --> 0:3:10,6
WHAT I REALLY HOPE IS YOU'LL THINK ABOUT IT
AFTER CLASS AND


40
0:3:10,6 --> 0:3:15,4
DISCUSS IT IN YOUR DISCUSSIONS AND LABS, SOME
OF THESE IDEAS.


41
0:3:15,4 --> 0:3:19,6
THE LEVELS OF ORGANIZATION CONCEPT. YOU GO
TO ALMOST ANY BIOLOGY


42
0:3:19,6 --> 0:3:25,569
TEXTBOOK AND YOU'LL SEE SOMETHING ABOUT THE
BIOLOGICAL HIERARCHY


43
0:3:25,569 --> 0:3:30,379
OR CONCEPT OF LEVELS OF ORGANIZATION. IT'S
THE WAY WE ORIENT


44
0:3:30,379 --> 0:3:36,599
OURSELVES IN SCIENCE OFTEN. OUR DEPARTMENTS
ARE DIVIDED ON THE


45
0:3:36,599 --> 0:3:40,299
BASIS OF THE STUDY OF THESE DIFFERENT LEVELS.
JOURNALS ARE


46
0:3:40,299 --> 0:3:47,9
DEDICATED TO THE STUDY OF THE PHENOMENON AT
VARIOUS LEVELS HERE. AND IN THE PHILOSOPHICAL


47
0:3:47,9 --> 0:3:48,12
SENSE


48
0:3:48,12 --> 0:3:53,29
THIS SCHEME, THIS HIERARCHY IS THOUGHT TO
REPRESENT THE ONTOLOGY


49
0:3:53,29 --> 0:4:0,189
OF NATURE, THE ACTUAL STRUCTURE OF EMPIRICAL
NATURE. SO WE LOOK


50
0:4:0,189 --> 0:4:3,709
AT IT HERE TO TRY TO DETERMINE WHERE WE'RE
WORKING. AND WHAT


51
0:4:3,709 --> 0:4:9,69
ECOLOGISTS STUDY IN THIS HIERARCHY. YOU HAVE
AT THE ONE EXTREME


52
0:4:9,69 --> 0:4:14,109
ATOMS, THE BUILDING BLOCKS OF MOLECULES WHICH
THEMSELVES GO INTO


53
0:4:14,109 --> 0:4:19,84
THE COMPOSITION AND CONSTRUCTION OF THE ORGANELLES,
THAT BUILD


54
0:4:19,84 --> 0:4:24,51
THE CELLS, THAT ARE THE FUNDAMENTAL BUILDING
BLOCKS OF ORGANISMAL


55
0:4:24,51 --> 0:4:30,92
STRUCTURE. VARIOUS CELL TYPES CONSTRUCTED
INTO TISSUES AND THE


56
0:4:30,92 --> 0:4:30,92



57
0:4:30,92 --> 0:4:36,15
TISSUES THEMSELVES ASSEMBLED INTO ORGAN SYSTEMS
THAT MAKE UP AN


58
0:4:36,15 --> 0:4:44,15
ORGANISM. SO ONCE WE GET TO THIS HALF OF THE
HIERARCHY, WITH


59
0:4:44,15 --> 0:4:48,94
THE ORGANISM AS A SORT OF A PIVOT BETWEEN
THESE LOWER LEVELS, THESE LOWER


60
0:4:48,94 --> 0:4:55,4
AND SMALLER AND INCLUDED LEVELS WITHIN THE
ORGANISM, WE EXTEND IT ABOVE THE ORGANISM


61
0:4:55,4 --> 0:4:57,91
TO ECOLOGICAL SYSTEMS


62
0:4:57,91 --> 0:5:10,1
TO GROUPS OF ORGANISMS AND THEIR ENVIRONMENTS.


63
0:5:10,1 --> 0:5:17,38
THAT IS A TREE. IT'S HERE. IT'S MAYBE A MAPLE
TREE, SOME


64
0:5:17,38 --> 0:5:23,56
KIND OF MAPLE. IT'S AN INDIVIDUAL ORGANISM.
THAT IS ONE


65
0:5:23,56 --> 0:5:28,44
INDIVIDUAL. IT'S A PLANT, IT'S A TREE, IT'S
A MAPLE TREE. IN


66
0:5:28,44 --> 0:5:35,72
OUR HIERARCHY, THAT WOULD CONSTITUTE AN ORGANISM,
RIGHT?


67
0:5:35,72 --> 0:5:42,81
HAVE A BUNCH OF THEM TOGETHER IN A SMALL FOREST,
YOU HAVE A


68
0:5:42,81 --> 0:5:49,39
POPULATION. IF WE'RE SPEAKING OF THE SAME
SPECIES OF MAPLE, THIS


69
0:5:49,39 --> 0:5:53,94
IS A POPULATION OF ORGANISMS. WE TEND TO USE
THAT TERM ONLY


70
0:5:53,94 --> 0:5:58,13
WITH REFERENCE TO MEMBERS OF SAME SPECIES.
BUT POPULATIONS DO


71
0:5:58,13 --> 0:6:3,64
NOT EXIST IN ISOLATION. THEY EXIST AS COMMUNITIES
OF ORGANISMS,


72
0:6:3,64 --> 0:6:9,25
OF MULTIPLE POPULATIONS. NOT ONLY ARE THERE
THE MAPLES BUT THERE


73
0:6:9,25 --> 0:6:15,8
ARE THE OTHER SPECIES OF TREE, THERE ARE MICE
AND DEER IN THE


74
0:6:15,8 --> 0:6:20,71
SYSTEM. BIRDS OVERHEAD. MICROBES IN THE SOIL,
EARTHWORMS,


75
0:6:20,71 --> 0:6:25,55
THIS IS A COMMUNITY OF MANY POPULATIONS, MANY
SPECIES COEXISTING


76
0:6:25,55 --> 0:6:33,21
IN A SINGLE LOCAL. YOUR EMPHASIS MIGHT BE
NOT JUST THE


77
0:6:33,21 --> 0:6:37,62
BIOLOGICAL COMMUNITY OF THAT SYSTEM BUT THE
INTERACTING


78
0:6:37,62 --> 0:6:44,52
BIOLOGICAL AND ABIOTIC SYSTEM. I'LL JUST HAVE
TO AVOID WRITING


79
0:6:44,52 --> 0:6:48,25
ON THE BOARD TODAY.


80
0:6:48,25 --> 0:6:52,84
THIS INTERACTING COMMUNITY OF ABIOTIC SYSTEM
IS WHAT PEOPLE


81
0:6:52,84 --> 0:6:58,44
CALL AN ECOSYSTEM. OR A LANDSCAPE OR A SEASCAPE.
THIS


82
0:6:58,44 --> 0:7:4,27
INTERACTING, BIOLOGICAL AND PHYSICAL SYSTEM
OFTEN TAKEN AT THIS


83
0:7:4,27 --> 0:7:4,56



84
0:7:4,56 --> 0:7:8,96
SCALE, A LARGE-SCALE.


85
0:7:8,96 --> 0:7:11,59
AND SCALE IT UP FURTHER AND YOU HAVE THE WHOLE
EARTH, YOU


86
0:7:11,59 --> 0:7:17,28
HAVE THE BIOSPHERE OR ECOSPHERE, ALL THE WORLD'S
ECOSYSTEMS AND


87
0:7:17,28 --> 0:7:23,68
LANDSCAPES PUT TOGETHER.


88
0:7:23,68 --> 0:7:29,61
THAT'S ALL FINE. I ONLY HAVE ONE DIFFICULTY
WITH THIS


89
0:7:29,61 --> 0:7:33,61
FORMAT REALLY. AND IT'S A PARTLY A RESULT
OF THE EVOLUTION OF


90
0:7:33,61 --> 0:7:36,49
OUR LANGUAGE AND OUR TERMS. BECAUSE PEOPLE
USE THE WORD


91
0:7:36,49 --> 0:7:43,56
ECOSYSTEM QUITE A LOT THESE DAYS TO REFER
TO ANY OF THESE LEVELS. YOU


92
0:7:43,56 --> 0:7:49,21
WILL HEAR SOMETIMES ABOUT THE CELLULAR ECOSYSTEM
OR YOUR OWN


93
0:7:49,21 --> 0:7:55,49
PERSONAL ECOSYSTEM. YOU AS AN INDIVIDUAL.
OR WE CAN SPEAK OF


94
0:7:55,49 --> 0:8:1,34
ECOSYSTEM OF THIS CLASSROOM. RIGHT? BECAUSE
ALL OF THESE


95
0:8:1,34 --> 0:8:5,81
BIOLOGICAL LEVELS EXIST IN A PHYSICAL CONTEXT.
YOU CAN'T


96
0:8:5,81 --> 0:8:10,58
SEPARATE A BIOLOGICAL PHENOMENON FROM ITS
ABIOTIC CONDITIONS AND


97
0:8:10,58 --> 0:8:14,96
ITS ABIOTIC ENVIRONMENT. THEY'RE INSEPERABLE.
IN THAT SENSE


98
0:8:14,96 --> 0:8:20,26
EVERYBODY BIOLOGICAL PHENOMENON IS ALSO A
ECOLOGICAL SYSTEM OR


99
0:8:20,26 --> 0:8:25,2
FOR SHORT, AN ECOSYSTEM. JUST RECOGNIZE THAT
THEY'RE REALLY TWO


100
0:8:25,2 --> 0:8:31,21
USES OF THAT WORD THAT ARE EVOLVING. ONE,
A DESCRIPTION OF THAT PARTICULAR LEVEL ALWAYS


101
0:8:31,21 --> 0:8:38,229
BETTER BELOW A LANDSCAPE *SYNONAMOUS WITH
A LANDSCAPE AND BELOW THE BIOSPHERE. ANOTHER


102
0:8:38,229 --> 0:8:40,409
MORE BROAD DEFINITION OF ECO


103
0:8:40,409 --> 0:8:45,23
SYSTEM, AS A SHORTHAND FOR ECOLOGICAL SYSTEM.
WHEN WE USE IT


104
0:8:45,23 --> 0:8:47,93
THAT WAY IN THAT BROAD SENSE WE'RE PERFECTLY
JUSTIFIED IN


105
0:8:47,93 --> 0:8:51,68
REFERRING TO A SAY CELLULAR ECOSYSTEM.


106
0:8:51,68 --> 0:8:59,38
I WON'T FOCUS ON THESE. THESE ARE JUST A COUPLE
OF TEXTBOOK EXAMPLES OF HOW THE


107
0:8:59,38 --> 0:9:2,88
HIERARCHY MIGHT BE PRESENTED. SHORT ON TIME.
I'LL JUST


108
0:9:2,88 --> 0:9:8,77
DELIVER THOSE TO YOU ON YOUR SLIDES. LOOKING
AT THIS ONE, WE


109
0:9:8,77 --> 0:9:11,77
CAN PLAY A LITTLE GAME. I DON'T THINK PEOPLE
CAN SEE MY LASER


110
0:9:11,77 --> 0:9:11,77



111
0:9:11,77 --> 0:9:17,18
POINTER IN THE ADJOINING ROOMS. WHAT WOULD
THIS BE AN EXAMPLE


112
0:9:17,18 --> 0:9:22,1
OF? IT'S NOT A GREAT PICTURE EXAMPLE, I WOULDN'T
THINK. BUT OF OUR LEVELS,


113
0:9:22,1 --> 0:9:26,29
GIVEN WHAT ELSE YOU SEE HERE, CONTEXT. WHAT
WOULD THIS BE? A POPULATION.


114
0:9:26,29 --> 0:9:32,44
IT'S A FAMILY. PROBABLY. IT'S A MOTHER AND
OFFSPRING BUT,


115
0:9:32,44 --> 0:9:37,24
YEAH, IT'S A POPULATION. IF YOU CAN FOCUS
ON A POPULATION AT


116
0:9:37,24 --> 0:9:41,67
ANY SCALE REALLY. WHETHER IT'S JUST FOUR OR
FIVE INDIVIDUALS,


117
0:9:41,67 --> 0:9:47,15
PARENT AND OFFSPRING OR ALL THE SPECIES OF
FIELD MOUSE IN THAT AREA,


118
0:9:47,15 --> 0:9:51,87
THAT WOULD BE THE POPULATION. THAT WOULD MAKE
THIS SUGGEST THAT


119
0:9:51,87 --> 0:9:55,34
THIS IS THE COMMUNITY, RIGHT. MANY SPECIES
OF ORGANISM, *FAMILIADS


120
0:9:55,34 --> 0:9:59,86
IN THE RAINFOREST WITH THEIR TREES AND FROGS
THAT ARE LIVING INSIDE THEM AND THE INSECTS


121
0:9:59,86 --> 0:10:4,75
THAT ARE FLITTING ABOUT AND SO FORTH. THIS
WOULD BE AN ECOSYSTEM BECAUSE YOU HAVE


122
0:10:4,75 --> 0:10:9,54
WATER THERE, I GUESS, AND SKY ABOVE REPRESENTING
THE ABIOTIC ENVIRONMENT. AND


123
0:10:9,54 --> 0:10:14,65
THE INTERACTION OF THE WHOLE COMMUNITY OF
THE ABIOTIC ENVIRONMENT. THIS REPRESENTING


124
0:10:14,65 --> 0:10:14,66
A


125
0:10:14,66 --> 0:10:20,779
LANDSCAPE IN THIS CONTEXT. A LANDSCAPE, SOMETIMES
A TERM USED TO REFER TO MULTIPLE


126
0:10:20,779 --> 0:10:25,98
ECOSYSTEMS AND THEIR INTERACTION. SO BE FLEXIBLE.
THAT'S ACTUALLY A HARD


127
0:10:25,98 --> 0:10:30,37
LESSON TO LEARN COMING INTO BIOLOGY, IS THE
DEFINITIONS IN


128
0:10:30,37 --> 0:10:33,89
BIOLOGY AND BOUNDARIES ARE OFTEN MUCH MORE
FUZZY THAN IN PHYSICS


129
0:10:33,89 --> 0:10:39,38
OR CHEMISTRY. THAT'S THE REALITY OF BIOLOGICAL
PHENOMENON.


130
0:10:39,38 --> 0:10:42,76
THEY EXIST VERY OFTEN WITH FUZZY BOUNDARIES
SO YOU NEED TO BE


131
0:10:42,76 --> 0:10:52,29
FLEXIBLE WITH YOUR DEFINITIONS. WE CAN'T FORGET
THE WHOLE EARTH AND ITS ROLE, RIGHT.


132
0:10:52,29 --> 0:10:57,67
GETTING INTO ETHOLOGY ABRUPTLY. THE SCIENCE
OF ANIMAL BEHAVIOR. IT


133
0:10:57,67 --> 0:11:4,11
REALLY CAME TO FORM WITH THE WORK OF THESE
THREE INDIVIDUALS.


134
0:11:4,11 --> 0:11:13,8
VON FRISH, LORENZ AND TINBERGEN, THREE EUROPEANS
WORKING VARIOUSLY IN THE EARLY AND MID AND


135
0:11:13,8 --> 0:11:19,48
LATE 1900S. WHO WERE RECOGNIZED IN THE '70S
FOR THE


136
0:11:19,48 --> 0:11:22,91
CONTRIBUTION THAT THEY'VE MADE. NOT RECOGNIZED
SO MUCH DURING


137
0:11:22,91 --> 0:11:22,91



138
0:11:22,91 --> 0:11:26,73
THEIR MOST ACTIVE PERIODS OF WORK BUT MUCH
LATER WITH NOBEL PRIZE FOR


139
0:11:26,73 --> 0:11:31,36
THEIR WORK IN ANIMAL BEHAVIOR. THEY WERE CREDITED
WITH HAVING ADVANCED


140
0:11:31,36 --> 0:11:39,48
THE STUDY OF ORGANISMAL BEHAVIOR BEYOND AN
OLDER AND STUBBORN DICHOTOMY BETWEEN VITALISTS


141
0:11:39,48 --> 0:11:39,66
AND


142
0:11:39,66 --> 0:11:47,36
MECHANISTS WHO REALLY WERE AT LOGGERHEADS
AND STRUGGLING TO MAKE


143
0:11:47,36 --> 0:11:52,49
STRONG INROADS IN TERMS OF THE EXPERIMENTAL
AND FIELD STUDY OF ANIMAL


144
0:11:52,49 --> 0:11:57,17
BEHAVIOR. ONE OF THE MAIN CONTRIBUTIONS OF
THESE GUYS WAS TO COUCH


145
0:11:57,17 --> 0:12:4,8
THE STUDY OF ANIMAL BEHAVIOR IN AN EVOLUTIONARY
CONTEXT. TO ASK


146
0:12:4,8 --> 0:12:10,16
QUESTIONS ABOUT BEHAVIOR IN THE CONTEXT OF
EVOLUTION AND ECOLOGY.


147
0:12:10,16 --> 0:12:13,29
SO A COUPLE EXAMPLES OF THEIR WORK. STARTING
WITH VON


148
0:12:13,29 --> 0:12:20,5
FRISH AND HIS STUDY OF HONEY BEES AND THEIR
COMMUNICATION.


149
0:12:20,5 --> 0:12:23,98
THESE SLIDES ARE NOT, THESE TOPICS ARE NOT
PART OF YOUR


150
0:12:23,98 --> 0:12:26,85
READING. THEY'RE IN YOUR BOOK SO YOU'RE WELCOME
TO REFER TO


151
0:12:26,85 --> 0:12:32,73
YOUR PARTS OF YOUR BOOK THAT COVER THEM. BUT
THEY ARE NOT PART OF YOUR ASSIGNED READING.


152
0:12:32,73 --> 0:12:33,589
THIS IS ALL TOO INTERESTING


153
0:12:33,589 --> 0:12:39,11
JUST TO SKIP. I'M NOT SURE WHAT'S MORE AMAZING?
THAT BEES


154
0:12:39,11 --> 0:12:43,54
ACTUALLY DO THIS OR THAT THIS GUY DISCOVERED
THIS. REALLY


155
0:12:43,54 --> 0:12:46,88
FANTASTIC THE WAY HONEYBEES COMMUNICATE KNOWLEDGE
OF THEIR


156
0:12:46,88 --> 0:12:50,69
ENVIRONMENTS. AND SPECIFICALLY THEIR FOOD
RESOURCES WHEN THEY


157
0:12:50,69 --> 0:12:53,91
GET BACK TO THE HIVE. A BEE COMES BACK TO
THE HIVE AND IT'S A


158
0:12:53,91 --> 0:12:58,27
BIG BUZZ OF ACTIVITY AND EVERYONE IS HUDDLING
AROUND WATCHING THE


159
0:12:58,27 --> 0:13:5,4
BEE DANCE. IF IT'S SORT OF A ROUND DANCE LIKE
THIS, IT INDICATES THAT FOOD IS VERY CLOSE


160
0:13:5,4 --> 0:13:8,87
BY AND GO SEE THIS FOOD..


161
0:13:8,87 --> 0:13:13,52
WITHOUT MUCH ADDITIONAL INSTRUCTION. BUT IF
THE BEE PERFORMS A


162
0:13:13,52 --> 0:13:19,66
A DANCE MORE STRUCTURED WITH THESE SEMI-CIRCLES
OF MOVEMENT, AND THEN THIS


163
0:13:19,66 --> 0:13:24,33
LONG LINE WHERE IT WAGGLES, IT'S GIVING SPECIFIC


164
0:13:24,33 --> 0:13:28,79
INFORMATION TO THE VIEWER ABOUT WHERE THE
FOOD SOURCE IS IN


165
0:13:28,79 --> 0:13:32,64
RELATION TO THE SUN, IN RELATION TO THE POSITION
OF THE HIVE


166
0:13:32,64 --> 0:13:36,769
ITSELF. SOMETHING ABOUT ITS DISTANCE GIVEN
THE DURATION OF THAT


167
0:13:36,769 --> 0:13:37,3



168
0:13:37,3 --> 0:13:41,54
LINEAR WAGGLE DANCE. IT COMMUNICATE THAT'S
TO THE OTHER BEES


169
0:13:41,54 --> 0:13:46,2
AND OFF THEY GO. IF IT WAGGLES LONG, ALONG
THAT LINEAR


170
0:13:46,2 --> 0:13:51,899
STRETCH THE NEXT BEE KNOWS TO FLY QUITE FAR
AND OFF IT GOES. JUST


171
0:13:51,899 --> 0:13:54,8
INCREDIBLE.


172
0:13:54,8 --> 0:13:58,25
HARD WON INFORMATION FROM VERY PATIENT OBSERVATION
UNDER A


173
0:13:58,25 --> 0:14:3,839
HOT SUN, GETTING STUNG IN THE FIELD. THIS
IS WHAT THE SENSE


174
0:14:3,839 --> 0:14:7,959
IN WHICH THIS IS ALL GROUNDED IN BASIC NATURAL
HISTORY. NIKO


175
0:14:7,959 --> 0:14:15,25
TINBRGEN'S RESEARCH, WASPS, FOLLOWING WASPS
BACK TO THEIR NEST, NOTING THAT THEY SEEM


176
0:14:15,25 --> 0:14:17,98
TO FIND THE HOLE THAT IS THEIR NEST.


177
0:14:17,98 --> 0:14:24,27
BASED ON A LANDMARK SYSTEM AND SOME SORT OF
SPATIAL LEARNING PROCESS. SO HE SET UP A SERIES


178
0:14:24,27 --> 0:14:25,49
OF LANDMARKS AROUND


179
0:14:25,49 --> 0:14:30,92
PINECONES TO TEST THIS IDEA. ALLOWED THE WASPS
TO ORIENT WITH THOSE PINECONES TO COME BACK


180
0:14:30,92 --> 0:14:32,1
TO THE NEST.


181
0:14:32,1 --> 0:14:37,44
BUT SWITCHED IT UP ON THE POOR LITTLE WASP
AND MOVED THE PINECONES AWAY FROM THE NEST


182
0:14:37,44 --> 0:14:41,3
SUCH THAT WHEN THEY CAME BACK NEXT TIME, SURE,
IT WENT TO ITS LANDMARKS


183
0:14:41,3 --> 0:14:47,88
AND USED THOSE AND SOUGHT THE NEST INSIDE
THE RING OF PINECONES AND WOULD DO SO INDEFINITELY


184
0:14:47,88 --> 0:14:54,85
UNTIL IT STUMBLED ON THE EXISTING NEST. AN
INSIGHT INTO HOW THEY'RE USING


185
0:14:54,85 --> 0:15:3,3
SPATIAL MAPS TO FIND RESOURCES OR IN THIS
CASE THEIR SHELTER.


186
0:15:3,3 --> 0:15:7,42
CONRAD LORENZ IS A BELOVED FIGURE IN BIOLOGY
IN MANY WAYS IN


187
0:15:7,42 --> 0:15:13,39
PART BECAUSE OF ENDEARING PICTURES LIKE THIS
FROM HIS HOME WHERE HE REALLY HAD


188
0:15:13,39 --> 0:15:18,589
GREAT INSIGHTS INTO ANIMAL BEHAVIOR AND EVEN
HUMAN BEHAVIOR. HE WAS A POPULARIZER


189
0:15:18,589 --> 0:15:23,51
AND VERY WELL KNOWN. BUT THESE PICTURES OF
VARIOUS WATER FOWL


190
0:15:23,51 --> 0:15:28,1
FOLLOWING HIM AROUND HIS PROPERTY ARE REALLY
KNOWN. THIS IS THE


191
0:15:28,1 --> 0:15:31,73
PHENOMENON OF INPRINTING WHERE AN ORGANISM
GOES THROUGH SENSITIVE


192
0:15:31,73 --> 0:15:36,69
DEVELOPMENTAL PERIOD EARLY IN ITS LIFE. WHERE
IT'S EXPOSED TO A


193
0:15:36,69 --> 0:15:41,29
CERTAIN BEHAVIOR OF ANOTHER ORGANISM OR OBJECT.
USUALLY THE


194
0:15:41,29 --> 0:15:46,37
PARENT OR SOME MEMBER OF SAME SPECIES, THAT
IT TAKES ON AS A


195
0:15:46,37 --> 0:15:51,26
FIXED PATTERN OF BEHAVIOR ITSELF. SO IT'S
A MECHANISM DURING


196
0:15:51,26 --> 0:15:51,26



197
0:15:51,26 --> 0:15:56,43
THIS SENSITIVE OR CRITICAL PERIOD IN DEVELOPMENT
TO ADOPT BEHAVIORS


198
0:15:56,43 --> 0:16:1,88
FROM OTHER MEMBERS OF THE SAME SPECIES. IN
THIS CASE IT'S JUST FOLLOWING AROUND


199
0:16:1,88 --> 0:16:7,709
WHAT ITS JUDGED TO BE THE PARENT WHEN EXPOSED
TO AN OBJECT THAT'S


200
0:16:7,709 --> 0:16:16,0
PARENTAL ENOUGH DURING THIS PERIOD. THERE
IS AN EXAMPLE IN YOUR BOOK HOW THIS PHENOMENON


201
0:16:16,0 --> 0:16:17,79
OF IMPRINTING IS USED TO ASSIST


202
0:16:17,79 --> 0:16:21,209
MIGRATION IN ENDANGERED SPECIES OF BIRDS TODAY.


203
0:16:21,209 --> 0:16:29,6
I'M GOING TO SKIP THIS EXAMPLE ENTIRELY. ITS
A REALLY GREAT EXAMPLE OF HOW OF THE GENETIC


204
0:16:29,6 --> 0:16:29,769
BASIS OF


205
0:16:29,769 --> 0:16:38,73
BEHAVIOR. SO THE INNATE ASPECTS OF BEHAVIOR.
I'LL FOCUS INSTEAD ON THE INNATE ASPECTS ON


206
0:16:38,73 --> 0:16:38,88
THE


207
0:16:38,88 --> 0:16:42,11
LEARNED COMPONENTS.


208
0:16:42,11 --> 0:16:45,94
SO WE'VE JUST LOOKED AT IMPRINTING AND SPATIAL
LEARNING AT THE TOP AND


209
0:16:45,94 --> 0:16:51,399
MOVING CLOCKWISE, WE CAN SEE, DISCUSS SOCIAL
LEARNING AND ASSOCIATIVE LEARNING AND


210
0:16:51,399 --> 0:16:54,67
COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR, BEHAVIOR IN COGNITIVE
LEARNING. LET'S LOOK


211
0:16:54,67 --> 0:16:58,279
AT EXAMPLE OF SOCIAL LEARNING FROM THE PRIMATES.
SOMETHING WE, OF COURSE,


212
0:16:58,279 --> 0:17:5,459
EXCEL AT SOCIAL LEARNING. WE'RE DOING IT HERE.
BY PRIMATES ARE ALSO EXCEL AT


213
0:17:5,459 --> 0:17:9,959
THIS TYPE OF LEARNING. LET'S SEE IF WE CAN
GET A VIDEO TO


214
0:17:9,959 --> 0:17:15,589
WORK. JUST AN AMAZING VIDEO OF THIS MOTHER
CHIMPANZEE IN THE


215
0:17:15,589 --> 0:17:23,6
CENTRAL AFRICAN RAINFOREST. THERE'S A CAMERA
SET UP AND IT'S NEVER BEEN SET UP BEFORE.


216
0:17:23,6 --> 0:17:27,74
YOU'LL SEE HER JUMP BECAUSE IT CLICKS.


217
0:17:27,74 --> 0:17:30,33
THERE. SHE'S NOT -- SHE KNOWS SOMETHING IS
DIFFERENT ABOUT THIS


218
0:17:30,33 --> 0:17:35,59
TERRITORY WHERE SHE'S BEEN FORAGING IN PREVIOUS
DAYS. SOMEONE SET UP A LITTLE BLIND WITH A


219
0:17:35,59 --> 0:17:38,179
CAMERA. BUT SHE FEELS COMFORTABLE


220
0:17:38,179 --> 0:17:43,28
ENOUGH THAT SHE CAN GO ABOUT HER BUSINESS.
SHE BRINGS A LONG HEAVY STICK TO


221
0:17:43,28 --> 0:17:49,5
PUUNCTURE THE SIDE TO CREATE ACCESS AND TO
INCITE THE WORKERS INSIDE


222
0:17:49,5 --> 0:17:54,679
THE NEST TO COME OUT. AND THEN A FINER STICK
THAT SHE'S BROUGHT IN HER MOUTH TO


223
0:17:54,679 --> 0:17:59,5
PROBE THAT LARGER HOLE TO GET THE WORKERS
AND THE TERMITES


224
0:17:59,5 --> 0:18:5,37
TO ATTACK IT AND GRAB ON SO SHE CAN EXTRACT
THOSE TERMITES


225
0:18:5,37 --> 0:18:12,0
TO EAT THEM. HER INFANT IS HANGING AROUND.
AND OFTEN IN THESE


226
0:18:12,0 --> 0:18:17,88
CASES WHETHER CRACKING NUTS OR FISHING FOR
TERMITES LIKE THIS, THE INFANT IS OFTEN RIGHT


227
0:18:17,88 --> 0:18:19,44
ON HER



228
0:18:19,44 --> 0:18:23,74
HIPS WATCHING VERY CLOSELY WHAT SHE'S DOING.
THEY'RE OBSERVING THE


229
0:18:23,74 --> 0:18:27,86
PATTERN OF BEHAVIOR AND LEARNING FROM WHAT
SHE'S DOING. THE


230
0:18:27,86 --> 0:18:31,85
OBJECTS SHE SELECTS TO PERFORM THE TASK, THE
MANNER IN WHICH


231
0:18:31,85 --> 0:18:35,82
SHE GO ABOUT THE TASK. THIS IS A TYPE OF SOCIAL
LEARNING


232
0:18:35,82 --> 0:18:41,92
THAT'S PARTICULAR IMPORTANT IN MAMMALS AND
PRIMATES AND HUMANS.


233
0:18:41,92 --> 0:18:50,929
BUT YOU SEE IT SURPRISINGLY IN MANY ORGANISMS.
I DON'T KNOW OF


234
0:18:50,929 --> 0:18:53,58
ANY PLANT EXAMPLES.


235
0:18:53,58 --> 0:18:57,7
A MORE SIMPLE TYPE OF LEARNING PERHAPS, ASSOCIATIVE


236
0:18:57,7 --> 0:19:3,52
LEARNING. YOU DO SOMETHING THAT ENDS UP BEING
UNCOMFORTABLE OR A RAT


237
0:19:3,52 --> 0:19:7,71
EATING BAIT LACED WITH POISON THAT DOESN'T
KILL IT BUT MAKES IT SICK, WILL


238
0:19:7,71 --> 0:19:13,53
BE INCLINED TO AVOID THAT ODOR THAT TYPE OF
BAIT THE NEXT TIME. ASSOCIATES THE EXPERIENCE


239
0:19:13,53 --> 0:19:13,96
WITH SOMETHING


240
0:19:13,96 --> 0:19:18,14
UNPLEASANT AND LEARNS FROM IT. BUT WHAT ABOUT
JUST BEING


241
0:19:18,14 --> 0:19:24,98
CLEVER? HERE'S A CROW WITH A STRAIGHT WIRE.
THE WIRE IS


242
0:19:24,98 --> 0:19:32,54
STRAITS SO IT CAN HARDLY PICK THE OBJECT UP.
SO FIGURE IT OUT.


243
0:19:32,54 --> 0:19:38,8
SOME ORGANISMS CAN. AND CROWS AND RAVENS,
IT'S BENDING THE WIRE


244
0:19:38,8 --> 0:19:47,45
NOW INTO A HOOK THAT IT CAN USE TO LIFT THE
OBJECT OUT. QUITE


245
0:19:47,45 --> 0:19:52,1
WELL DONE. BECAUSE, IT'S SMART, RIGHT? I DON'T
HAVE ANY


246
0:19:52,1 --> 0:19:57,17
PROBLEM CALLING THAT ANIMAL CLEVER. IT HAS
ITS OWN COGNITION


247
0:19:57,17 --> 0:20:3,15
THAT'S, FLEXIBLE WITH DEGREES OF FREEDOM SUCH
THAT IT CAN PERFORM THESE KINDS OF REMARKABLE


248
0:20:3,15 --> 0:20:9,86
TASK. IN SAYING THAT WE'RE REALLY NOT SAYING
ANY PHYSIOLOGICALLY


249
0:20:9,86 --> 0:20:14,88
ABOUT THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR
OR MIND AND


250
0:20:14,88 --> 0:20:21,37
BODY OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT. YOU CAN STUDY
THIS EXTERNALLY WHILE


251
0:20:21,37 --> 0:20:27,24
BLACK BOXING THE COGNITION LARGELY.


252
0:20:27,24 --> 0:20:30,95
THIS WHOLE FIELD OF BEHAVIORAL ECOLOGY IS
WHAT WOULD LINK THE FIELDS OF


253
0:20:30,95 --> 0:20:35,23
ETHOLOGY AND ECOLOGY. WE CAN DO MORE. AND
HOPEFULLY SOME OF


254
0:20:35,23 --> 0:20:35,23



255
0:20:35,23 --> 0:20:41,62
YOU WILL DO MORE AND MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS TO
FORMING THAT BRIDGE BETWEEN ECOLOGY AND ETHOLOGY.


256
0:20:41,62 --> 0:20:46,419
IT'S REALLY RIPE FOR DEVELOPMENT. I'LL JUST


257
0:20:46,419 --> 0:20:57,11
HINT HERE AT THE EVOLUTION OF THESE BEHAVIORS.
BUT THIS WILL


258
0:20:57,11 --> 0:20:59,78
MAKE A LOT MORE SENSE TO YOU AFTER YOU HAVE
STUDIED EVOLUTION


259
0:20:59,78 --> 0:21:4,0
ITSELF IN THE SECOND MODULE. SO CARRY THAT
SLIDE ACROSS THE


260
0:21:4,0 --> 0:21:8,26
SEMESTER. WE'LL GET BACK TO IT.


261
0:21:8,26 --> 0:21:14,35
IN THIS EVOLUTIONARY CONTEXT, EVOLUTION BY
NATURAL SELECTION


262
0:21:14,35 --> 0:21:21,96
IS THOUGHT TO HAVE MADE EFFICIENT MANY THESE
BEHAVIORS.


263
0:21:21,96 --> 0:21:26,65
SOME SPEAK OF OPTIMIZING THESE BEHAVIORS FOR
ACTIVITIES.


264
0:21:26,65 --> 0:21:32,66
REDUCING THE COSTS AND MAXIMUMING THE BENEFITS.
YOU WILL SEE


265
0:21:32,66 --> 0:21:36,84
SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN ONE OF YOUR LABS IN
A COUPLE OF WEEKS.


266
0:21:36,84 --> 0:21:40,63
YOU'LL SEE A BIT OF THIS IN ACTION. HERE'S
AN EXAMPLE OF AN


267
0:21:40,63 --> 0:21:49,7
OPTIMAL FORAGING, STUDY IN OPTIMAL FORAGING,
WITH CROWS AND A TYPE


268
0:21:49,7 --> 0:21:59,25
OF SEA SNAIL, A WHELK. AN EXAMPLE IN YOUR
BOOK AND, LET ME JUST


269
0:21:59,25 --> 0:22:2,2
BRIEFLY REVIEW HERE. YOU CAN LOOK IN THE BOOK
FOR DETAILS.


270
0:22:2,2 --> 0:22:8,34
BASICALLY THE CROWS CARRY A HARD SHELLED SNAIL
AND DROP IT ON HARD


271
0:22:8,34 --> 0:22:18,24
SURFACE TO CRACK IT. THEY PICK MUSCLES UP
AND DROP IT ON THE


272
0:22:18,24 --> 0:22:24,59
PAVEMENT. CROWS DO IT. AND THE INVESTIGATORS
WERE INTERESTED


273
0:22:24,59 --> 0:22:29,7
IN WHETHER THEY HAVE A PARTICULAR HEIGHT THEY
PREFER TO DROP THEM


274
0:22:29,7 --> 0:22:33,74
FROM. AS YOU IMAGE, IT'S TRADEOFF BETWEEN
HOW HIGH YOU WANT


275
0:22:33,74 --> 0:22:41,16
TO FLY AND HOW MANY TIMES YOU HAVE TO MAKE
THAT FLIGHT. IF YOU CARRY


276
0:22:41,16 --> 0:22:43,62
ONE OF THESE SNAILS UP A METER AND DROP IT,
IT'S NOT GOING TO


277
0:22:43,62 --> 0:22:52,34
BREAK. IT TAKES A LOT OF ENERGY TO FLY 30
METERS. BUT IT


278
0:22:52,34 --> 0:22:56,309
MIGHT BE WORTH IT IF YOUR SNAIL IS SO NUTRITIOUS.
THERE ARE


279
0:22:56,309 --> 0:23:4,21
TRADEOFFS IN THIS PROCESS. I'LL LET YOU REVIEW
THE SLIDE.


280
0:23:4,21 --> 0:23:9,71
INVESTIGATORS FOUND THE MOST EFFICIENT HEIGHT
BASED ON THEIR


281
0:23:9,71 --> 0:23:9,71



282
0:23:9,71 --> 0:23:14,9
EXPERIMENTS, THE MOST EFFICIENT HEIGHT TO
DROP THEM FROM WHERE


283
0:23:14,9 --> 0:23:18,26
YOU REDUCE THE ENERGY EXPENDED IN LIKELIHOOD
OF BREAKAGE AND MAXIMIZE THE


284
0:23:18,26 --> 0:23:23,94
LIKELIHOOD OF BREAKAGE AROUND FIVE METERS.
AND MEASURED IN THE FIELD THE CROWS THEN AVERAGE


285
0:23:23,94 --> 0:23:24,25
SOMETHING


286
0:23:24,25 --> 0:23:32,1
SIMILAR IN THE HEIGHT IN WHICH THEY DROP THE
SNAIL. SUPPORTING A NOTION OF THEIR BEHAVIOR


287
0:23:32,1 --> 0:23:36,88
HAVING BEEN, QUOTE UNQUOTE, OPTIMIZED IN SOME
SENSE. I'LL LET YOU THINK ABOUT


288
0:23:36,88 --> 0:23:40,63
WHETHER EVOLUTION HAS DONE THAT. IS THAT VIA
EVOLUTION BY


289
0:23:40,63 --> 0:23:44,799
NATURAL SELECTION THAT THAT BEHAVIOR HAS OPTIMIZED
OR IS THIS THE


290
0:23:44,799 --> 0:23:51,75
CROW COGNITIVELY REALIZING THAT BETTER HEIGHTS
TO DROP THINGS FROM


291
0:23:51,75 --> 0:23:56,84
DURING ITS OWN LIFETIME. OPEN QUESTIONS.


292
0:23:56,84 --> 0:24:2,23
HAVING GLAZED THROUGH THESE, I REALLY ONLY
HAVE ONE MORE


293
0:24:2,23 --> 0:24:8,77
SECTION TO COVER. AND HOPEFULLY WE KNOW THE
PROBLEM NOW IN THE


294
0:24:8,77 --> 0:24:14,58
TECHNOLOGY ISSUE HERE SO IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN.


295
0:24:14,58 --> 0:24:21,63
ORGANISMS ARE MEMBERS OF POPULATIONS. YOU
CAN'T JUST HAVE


296
0:24:21,63 --> 0:24:29,59
AN ISOLATED ORGANISM OUTSIDE OF ITS POPULATION
CONTEXT BECAUSE THEY


297
0:24:29,59 --> 0:24:37,11
NEED TO REPRODUCE WITH OTHER ORGANISMS. AND
SOME ORGANISMS NOT


298
0:24:37,11 --> 0:24:42,789
ONLY EXIST IN POPULATIONS BUT LIVE CLOSELY
WITH ONE ANOTHER IN


299
0:24:42,789 --> 0:24:49,59
HIGHLY INTERACTIVE SOCIETIES, SOCIAL GROUPS.
SO LET'S THINK A


300
0:24:49,59 --> 0:24:55,98
LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHY, ABOUT THE COSTS AND
BENEFITS OF SOCIAL


301
0:24:55,98 --> 0:25:2,539
LIVING, OF GROUP LIVING. WE EXCEL AT THIS
IN OUR CITIES AND


302
0:25:2,539 --> 0:25:7,36
CLASSROOMS. WE DO PRETTY WELL AS A BUNCH OF
LITTLE PRAIRIE DOGS


303
0:25:7,36 --> 0:25:12,87
GETTING ALONG WELL ENOUGH TOGETHER IN TIGHT
GROUPS LIKE THIS. PIGEONS,


304
0:25:12,87 --> 0:25:19,61
GO OUT TO TOWN AND YOU'LL SEE THIS. WHY ARE
PIGEONS DOING THIS? GIVE ME


305
0:25:19,61 --> 0:25:22,559
A COUPLE OF REASONS WHY YOU MIGHT SEE A SCENE
LIKE THIS.


306
0:25:22,559 --> 0:25:25,309
WE'RE ALL IN HERE TOGETHER BECAUSE YOU GUYS
NEED CREDITS AND YOU NEED TO GRADUATE AND


307
0:25:25,309 --> 0:25:27,33
WE ALL NEED TO BE IN THE SAME PLACE. WHY


308
0:25:27,33 --> 0:25:34,12
ARE PIGEONS DOING THIS? SAFETY. YEAH. MAYBE
THERE'S SAFETY


309
0:25:34,12 --> 0:25:37,49
IN BEING PART OF A BIG GROUP. IF IT WAS JUST
ONE PIDGEON OUT BY


310
0:25:37,49 --> 0:25:44,34
ITSELF IT COULD GET HARASSED TO THE POINT
OF DYING BY A HAWK OR


311
0:25:44,34 --> 0:25:44,34



312
0:25:44,34 --> 0:25:47,91
SOMETHING LIKE THAT. WHEREAS IF IT'S PART
OF A BIG GROUP, MAYBE


313
0:25:47,91 --> 0:25:53,97
INDIVIDUALLY, EACH IS LESS VULNERABLE. POSSIBLY.
WHAT ELSE? WHY MIGHT THEY BE


314
0:25:53,97 --> 0:26:0,59
TOGETHER HERE? CHANCE OF FINDING A MATE. YEAH.
IF YOU'RE A


315
0:26:0,59 --> 0:26:8,0
BUNCH OF ORANGUTANS SPREAD ABOUT THE FOREST,
LIVING SOLITARILY


316
0:26:8,0 --> 0:26:12,49
YOU MIGHT HAVE A HARD TIME FINDING A MATE
UNLESS YOU CONGEAL INTO


317
0:26:12,49 --> 0:26:16,789
A MORE LOCALIZED REGION. SAME WITH BIRDS AND
OTHER ORGANISMS.


318
0:26:16,789 --> 0:26:20,83
IT MIGHT BE EASIER TO FIND A MATE WHEN REPRODUCTIVE
SEASON COMES


319
0:26:20,83 --> 0:26:30,39
AROUND. WHAT ELSE? YEAH? MOST LIKELY FIND
FOOD. OR MAYBE THERE'S A GREAT PATCH


320
0:26:30,39 --> 0:26:36,799
OF FOOD. PERHAPS ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCES HAVE
LEAD THIS GROUP


321
0:26:36,799 --> 0:26:42,7
TO EXIST HERE. SO NOT ANY REAL SOCIAL DYNAMIC
ITSELF. BUT THE


322
0:26:42,7 --> 0:26:45,22
EXISTENCE OF THIS RESOURCE. THERE'S ANOTHER
SIDE OF IT THAT


323
0:26:45,22 --> 0:26:48,71
I'LL HIGHLIGHT IN A MINUTE BUT MAYBE MORE
OF WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT


324
0:26:48,71 --> 0:26:53,36
IN TERMS OF FINDING FOOD. ANYTHING ELSE I
SHOULD CONSIDER AS A REASON


325
0:26:53,36 --> 0:26:59,73
WHY THESE GUYS MIGHT BE TOGETHER?


326
0:26:59,73 --> 0:27:1,52
ONE THING, ON THE RIGHT ARE


327
0:27:1,52 --> 0:27:5,57
SCHOOLING FISH. AND SHARKS MOVING THROUGH
THESE SCHOOLS OF FISH.


328
0:27:5,57 --> 0:27:10,61
THAT GIVES YOU A SENSE OF THAT SAFETY-IN-NUMBERS
IDEA, PROBABLY


329
0:27:10,61 --> 0:27:14,77
RIGHT? IF YOU'RE A SCHOOL OF FISH AND YOU'RE
A LITTLE FISHY OUT BY YOURSELF,


330
0:27:14,77 --> 0:27:18,309
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO SURVIVE THE ATTACK OF
A BIG SHARK. BUT IF YOU'RE IN THIS MASSIVE


331
0:27:18,309 --> 0:27:22,659
SCHOOL, THE LIKELIHOOD OF GETTING NAILED IS
LESS BECAUSE YOU HAVE SO MANY OF YOUR NEIGHBORS


332
0:27:22,659 --> 0:27:26,15
AROUND YOU.


333
0:27:26,15 --> 0:27:27,75
THE OLD SAYING ABOUT


334
0:27:27,75 --> 0:27:32,61
WHEN YOU ENCOUNTER A GRIZZLY BEAR WITH YOUR
FRIEND IN THE FOREST, WHAT SHOULD YOU DO?


335
0:27:32,61 --> 0:27:32,88
RUN


336
0:27:32,88 --> 0:27:36,99
FASTER THAN YOUR FRIEND.


337
0:27:36,99 --> 0:27:44,12
SO THE IMAGE ON THE LEFT IS, SHOWS SOME DATA
ABOUT FLOCKING


338
0:27:44,12 --> 0:27:50,15
PIGEONS. AND THE DISTANCE WITH WHICH THEY
PERCEIVE A PREDATOR


339
0:27:50,15 --> 0:27:56,39
IN RELATION TO THE SIZE OF THE FLOCK. THAT'S
SOMETHING CALLED THE MANY EYES


340
0:27:56,39 --> 0:28:0,48
HYPOTHESIS FOR FLOCKING. BY BEING IN A BIG
GROUP YOU HAVE MORE


341
0:28:0,48 --> 0:28:0,48



342
0:28:0,48 --> 0:28:6,23
EYES, MORE PERCEPTUAL, A GREATER PERCEPTUAL
RANGE FOR PERCEIVING


343
0:28:6,23 --> 0:28:13,72
THREATS AS YOU MULTIPLY YOUR SENSORY DEVICES.
PENGUINS HAVE


344
0:28:13,72 --> 0:28:22,539
BECOME VERY POPULAR IN RECENT YEARS BASED
ON A COUPLE BIG FILMS. WHY ARE THEY HANGING


345
0:28:22,539 --> 0:28:22,7
OUT


346
0:28:22,7 --> 0:28:29,98
TOGETHER? THE REPRODUCTIVE ASPECT. BUT WHAT
ELSE? WARMTH.


347
0:28:29,98 --> 0:28:34,929
THERMO REGULATION. BASIC PHYSIOLOGICAL BENEFIT
OF HUDDLING IN


348
0:28:34,929 --> 0:28:40,33
SUCH A BITTERLY COLD ENVIRONMENT. BY MAINTAINING
CLOSE CONTACT,


349
0:28:40,33 --> 0:28:48,44
KEEP THEIR TEMPERATURES UP.


350
0:28:48,44 --> 0:28:53,809
LET'S THINK OF AT LEAST ONE NEGATIVE EXAMPLE
OF, I'VE DROPPED THE


351
0:28:53,809 --> 0:29:0,34
NEGATIVE AMONG THE POSITIVE. AN EXAMPLE HERE
IN A MOMENT. DISEASE, AND SPREAD OF


352
0:29:0,34 --> 0:29:6,45
PATHOGENS. THERE'S A MAJOR COROLLARY OF GROUP
LIVING FOR MANY


353
0:29:6,45 --> 0:29:11,37
ORGANISMS. THE GREATER THE DENSITIES, THE
MORE RAPID AND LIKELY


354
0:29:11,37 --> 0:29:16,39
THE SPREAD OF PATHOGENS AND DISEASE. TRUE
IN HUMAN SOCIETIES IN


355
0:29:16,39 --> 0:29:22,179
MANY CASES TOO, RIGHT? BIRDS, FEATHER MITES
ARE A BIG PROBLEM FOR


356
0:29:22,179 --> 0:29:29,46
BIRDS. MITES THAT NIBBLE AND EAT THE FEATHERS.
AND BIRDS THAT


357
0:29:29,46 --> 0:29:36,32
LIVE IN LARGER COLONIES MAY EXPERIENCE INFESTATION
OF SUCH MITES BY


358
0:29:36,32 --> 0:29:41,309
CLOSE GROUP LIVING. THESE YOU CAN SEE MORE
AND MORE AROUND


359
0:29:41,309 --> 0:29:45,559
CALIFORNIA. IT'S THE LARGEST BIRD IN CALIFORNIA
EXCEPT MAYBE


360
0:29:45,559 --> 0:29:52,24
THE CONDOR. I SAW A FLOCK OVER BERKELEY OF
WHITE PELICANS. WHEN YOU SEE THEM


361
0:29:52,24 --> 0:29:56,2
IN BERKELEY THEY'RE GOING TO BE WAY OVERHEAD
AND FLYING FROM


362
0:29:56,2 --> 0:30:1,59
POINT REYES. YOU SEE THEM MORE AND MORE. THEY'RE
FABULOUS


363
0:30:1,59 --> 0:30:6,4
WHEN YOU SEE THEM IN THEIR OWN ECOSYSTEMS.
BECAUSE THEY'LL GROUP FORAGE. THEY'LL FORM


364
0:30:6,4 --> 0:30:6,65
A


365
0:30:6,65 --> 0:30:10,9
PHALANX LIKE THIS ONE ON THE BOTTOM. AND HERD
FISH INTO THE


366
0:30:10,9 --> 0:30:14,86
SHALLOWS WHERE THEY CAN SCOOP THEM UP MORE
EASILY. BECAUSE


367
0:30:14,86 --> 0:30:19,0
THEY'RE DIPPPING THEIR BIG BILLS AND HEADS
UNDER THE WATER TO


368
0:30:19,0 --> 0:30:24,82
SCOOP THE FISH. THEY NEED TO HERD THEM TOGETHER
TO MAKE THAT POSSIBLE. AND


369
0:30:24,82 --> 0:30:24,82



370
0:30:24,82 --> 0:30:33,419
ANOTHER EXAMPLE AND A GOOD ONE TO LEAVE YOU
WITH. GROUP FORAGING THAT ENABLES RELATIVELY


371
0:30:33,419 --> 0:30:33,799
SMALL


372
0:30:33,799 --> 0:30:39,59
ORGANISMS TO CAPTURE NUTRITIOUS LOADS OF FOOD
WHEN WORKING


373
0:30:39,59 --> 0:30:43,799
TOGETHER. SORRY FOR THE TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES.
SEE YOU


374
0:30:43,799 --> 0:30:50,14
WEDNESDAY. MY OFFICE HOURS ARE EVERYDAY AFTER
LECTURE.


375
0:30:50,14 --> 0:32:50,14
