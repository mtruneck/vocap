###71 You! Where have you been? It's a busy weekend. You'll be doing triple shifts.
###76 I was going to see some friends, actually.
###79 - Has anyone called? - No, not a soul.
###82 Nobody rings me these days, Bernard.
###85 It's a mystery, what with you owning sandals and having egg in your beard.
###90 Hey, Manny, guess what.
###92 I bumped into Paul and he's invited me as well.
###95 - To what? - The reggae barbecue.
###97 - He said he left you a message. - No.
###100 No one's called here.
###102 Oh, look, you've got a message.
###105 No, that light means the machine needs more salt.
###109 Don't touch it. Don't touch it! Don't touch it!
###112 (Beep)
###114 (Woman) 'Manny,
###116 - 'it's your mum.' - Oh, God.
###118 'We left a message to say we were coming for the weekend
###121 'and you didn't ring us back
###123 - 'so we assumed it was OK.' - What?
###126 'We should get there some time between 5:45
###129 'and 5:47.'
###133 Bernard, will it be all right if my mum and dad stay?
###137 Absolutely not, it's a busy weekend.
###139 B-b-but they're coming! They're driving hundreds of miles!
###143 Arguing about why Auntie Dora snubbed Auntie Nora in 1953!
###148 - What am I gonna say? - I don't care.
###151 - But they-they... - It's not my problem.
###153 I'm not having my house infected with the kind of specimens
###157 capable of producing you.
###161 Bernard.
###163 Can I have a little chat? Just for a mo.
###165 No.
###169 Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah!
###171 Ah! Ahh!
###174 (Clattering crash)
###179 - You are being very mean to Manny. - I can't help it.
###183 He looks like a horse in a man costume.
###187 It's just his mum and dad for a weekend. Why can't he have them round?
###191 Yeah, well, that's easy for you to say.
###194 You'll be off on the barge trying to find your booty
###197 in a haze of gange an' ting.
###199 How did you know it was on a barge?
###202 I didn't. I don't. I... I don't.
###205 - I... - You nasty man.
###208 You've been screening his calls.
###210 Well, he doesn't need friends. They're bad for him, they make him giddy.
###215 Let his mum and dad stay or I'll tell him.
###218 - What if I did? Would you help? - Absolutely not.
###221 (West Indian accent) I be on the boat, far away from the parent-clot.
###226 (Kisses teeth) Cha!
###229 Fine, they're not staying.
###232 All right, all right, I'll be here.
###234 It'll be fun.
###236 Really? Well, I want that in writing.
###243 It'II... be... fun.
###246 Sign it. Sign it.
###247 Signed Fran Katzenjammer.
###256 - All right, all right, they can stay. - Thanks, Bernard!
###259 That's fantastic! They're staying!
###262 They're staying! Aghh!
###265 I can't breathe! The walls... The walls are closing in!
###269 - Stop it! Stop dying! - Oh! Oh, God.
###272 - God! Arrrgh! - It's only your parents.
###275 - Oh, God! God! Arrrgh! Arrgh! - He's hysterical. Leave him to me.
###279 - Ohhh... ohh. - Clear out.
###281 CALM DOWN! CALM DOWN! CALM DOWN!
###285 (Screaming)
###287 - (Grunting) - OK, deep breaths.
###289 (Inhales noisily)
###291 - (Muffled screams) - CALM! CALM!
###306 It can't be done, I can't clean the shop in time.
###318 Manny, I'm about to pass on a secret known only to women and gay men.
###322 You don't have to clean everything.
###324 You can cover stuff with an Indian throw.
###329 Haja-shazam!
###332 Brilliant. Right...
###334 Haja...
###336 haja-whooja!
###339 (Muttering) Haja... haja... haja...
###343 Down! Down!
###347 You will be nice, won't you, Bernard?
###349 (Hollow cracking)
###351 - Quit that! - Sorry. My mum does that.
###355 # Pardon me, boy Is that the Chattanooga choo-choo?
###360 # Track twenty-nine Won't you give me... #
###363 Stop singing.
###365 Sorry. My... My dad does that.
###368 Everything's fine, Manny. You're all ready.
###372 - Did you wash behind your ears? - Yeah.
###375 - No! - I'm joking.
###377 Oh. Oh, I'm not ready, I'll never be ready. What time is it?
###381 5:46.
###385 (Both) Manny!
###387 Moo-Ma! Moo-Pa!
###391 Mwah! Mwah!
###393 Ah-ha-haa!
###395 Oh-ho-ho. Ah...
###397 Ha-ha-ha.
###400 (Gibbers)
###402 Th-th-the traffic? Was it all right?
###405 - Mmm! - You had a good journey?
###407 - Yes. - Good. And was it a pleasant trip?
###410 Good, good, good, good.
###412 - So are you... are you well? - Yes.
###414 - Easy. - Easy! Easy! Well...
###417 I expect you'll want to beat the traffic.
###420 It's been lovely. Thank you very much for coming. See you soon! Bye!
###442 - Well, this is nice. - Very nice.
###445 (Hollow cracking)
###448 # Pardon me, boy
###450 # Is that the Chattanooga choo-choo?
###454 # Track twenty-nine Woo... #
###457 (Bernard grunts tunelessly)
###459 It's so nice to meet you at last, Fran.
###463 Yes. You too.
###473 The shop's, erm, still called Black Books, I see.
###477 Yeah. I was gonna call it World Of Tights
###480 but you have to spell everything out to people.
###484 Manny mentioned you were making him a partner.
###489 So I thought it might be Black & Bianco Books.
###493 - Or Bianco & Black Books. - Yes. That has a nice ring.
###500 # Pardon me, boy
###502 # Is that the... Chattanooga choo-choo #
###505 (Grinding crunch)
###512 - Why don't I show you to your room? - Ah.
###514 You'll probably want to relax, refresh yourselves before we go out.
###518 You're in my room. It's just at the top of the stairs. I'll be on the old sofa.
###523 So, er, if you need anything, just shout out,
###527 "Manny-Moo!"
###529 - (Crunching) - Ah. Well...
###532 seemed to go quite well.
###534 (Bernard laughing)
###540 (Squeaking)
###550 Would you like to explain
###552 before I turn you into a moo-CORPSE?
###555 Well, when I write them a letter, I do tend to put a bit of a gloss on things.
###559 Anything else we should know?
###563 They kept asking me whether I was seeing anyone.
###566 And I did say - and this is a bit of a fib -
###569 that I had a girlfriend.
###571 (Fran) Mmm.
###573 What's she like, then?
###576 Well, she's about... medium height,
###580 dark hair,
###581 named Fran.
###583 Look, I just want them to be happy.
###586 Just touch me on the knee now and again till Sunday.
###589 OK. But there won't be any kissing.
###592 Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no.
###594 Ho-ho-hooo, no, no, no, no, no. No, no, no.
###598 Although, er...
###608 I rather fancy the tagliatelle with whole baby squid.
###612 - That sounds delicious. - Oh, yeah.
###614 - Only £17.50. - (Manny) Jesus.
###618 I mean, erm, I heard once
###620 that squid can sometimes survive the cooking process
###624 and wake up in your stomach and strangle your heart.
###629 Maybe not the squid.
###632 No, the garden salad here is amazing. That's what we should have.
###636 - Excellent. - Oh, well, righto, then.
###641 Where's the wine list?
###645 Here.
###646 They've got some rather cheeky Lafites for under a hundred quid.
###651 What about the pinot ninor ninor?
###654 £2.85.
###657 Well, this is lovely.
###659 Yes. Reminds me of the first time I went to an Italian restaurant. 1965, I think.
###665 I went in, and you know, the first thing I saw...
###668 Maybe it was 1964.
###670 Couldn't have been 1963 because I couldn't drive then.
###673 I don't think I had the Hillman at that time.
###676 Yes, I bought the Hillman in 1966, the year of the World Cup.
###681 I bought it at an auction.
###683 There was this fascinating chap there...
###685 Oh dear, I've dropped my fork! Excuse me, I'd better get that.
###689 (# Quiet piano music)
###702 Give me a martini, will you?
###704 He worked for Sir Leonard Hutton, the great Yorkshire cricketer...
###708 - (Fork clatters) - Whoops, butter fingers!
###714 Bernard, don't be like this. Help him out.
###717 It's just till Sunday.
###719 Come on.
###727 Yes, it was definitely 1963.
###729 Or two.
###731 # Pardon me, boy
###732 # Is that the Chattanooga choo-choo?
###735 - # Track twenty-nine... # - People leave it too late these days,
###739 - and I don't think that's wise. - Leave what late?
###742 Babies.
###744 Why are you mentioning babies?
###746 Who else do you give a choo-choo too?
###753 - (Fork clatters) - Oops!
###758 Give me a daiquiri.
###764 I am not going back up.
###767 I'm going to stay here forever and live on broken bread sticks.
###771 Come on.
###773 It's fun, fun, fun!
###791 - Wine, please. - Lots of wine.
###793 - Expensive wine. Wine. - Wine from the bottom of the list. Wine!
###802 - Are you sure, Manny? - The bill was rather a lot.
###805 Would you like us to pay for some of it?
###811 No, I couldn't let you do that.
###813 He's quite the Mr Moneybags now.
###815 - Yes, I... It's the least I could do. - Well, thank you.
###818 Well, boys, shall we leave the ladies to it?
###822 - To what? - I'm sure you've got a lot to talk about.
###825 We'll just settle in next door with a brandy.
###828 Oh. Ha-ha.
###830 I thought you were serious for a minute.
###833 This is the good stuff, Manny. Come on! Ha!
###843 Have fun.
###851 I spent most of my time working for the big companies.
###854 But I did dabble at being an entrepreneur, like you two.
###858 Remember, Manny? 1972, it was.
###860 I got back from that conference and...
###864 No, 1973, it must have been.
###866 Er, we weren't in the bungalow any more.
###869 We moved into the semi. Or was it the gatehouse?
###871 No, I think it was the semi.
###873 More details. What time of year? What jumper did you wear?
###878 Of course, I went under in '76.
###880 AH! That's when we moved into the semi. Yes.
###883 Oh. But I'm so proud of you, Manny. You want your children to do better than you.
###889 Not to... Not to work for somebody else but to be in control!
###894 To Manny and his immense success.
###899 So...
###901 Manny's good to you, is he?
###904 Yes, he's a wonderful friend.
###908 Oh. Yes, I see.
###910 And lover, obviously.
###915 It's a bit strange to talk to you about it.
###918 Well, I was young once.
###921 Oh, well, the sex is unbelievable, he's a beast.
###933 Course, when you're running the show,
###935 sometimes you've got to be a bit of a bastard!
###938 If you'll excuse my French. Am I right or am I right?
###942 Yes, Moo-Pa. Yes.
###943 We had a customer one time and he was shoplifting
###947 and he had the nerve to try and sell us the books back!
###950 (Laughs) What did you do with him, eh?
###953 I told him, I said, "This... really isn't on."
###956 Oh! I bet those weren't your exact words, though.
###959 I bet it was more like, "Do I look like a donkey?
###962 "Think you can take me for a ride? Thief!
###965 "Get out or I'll tear you open like a bag of crisps."
###970 Oh, now look, you've got him excited.
###973 - Oh, hello, Moo-Ma. - Time for bed.
###976 Ohhh...
###977 Doesn't your mother look lovely? Eh?
###982 - Right, I'll be off, I'll see you tomorrow. - Oh, don't leave on our account.
###986 I bet you two would like to snuggle up on the couch.
###990 - Good night, then. - Good night.
###994 - (Moo-Ma) How many did you have? - Oh, two little ones.
###997 Well, six little ones.
###999 - (Door closes) - My bedroom is next to theirs.
###1003 If I hear any nonagenarian hanky-panky, I'm calling the police.
###1021 Hmm... No.
###1023 No, I won't go back in the cupboard.
###1026 Egh... ooph.
###1030 (Man, whispering) Excuse me.
###1037 Now you two can just have a lie-in.
###1040 Moo-Pa and I get up early so we cleaned round and opened the shop.
###1048 - Where's my dress? - Oh, it's in the wash.
###1051 I put yours and Manny's in together.
###1053 (Dry retching)
###1055 I had to wash Bernard's separately because they were a bit dirty.
###1060 (Bernard) Who tidied my room? Who shaved me?
###1063 Who washed my clothes?
###1067 Morning, Bernard.
###1070 Oh, God, you're still alive.
###1072 Listen, it's, erm... Saturday here in London town.
###1077 Why don't you nip out and see a few of the sights, or something.
###1081 - London can be very expensive. - Oh, please.
###1084 Here. Go and see Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.
###1087 - See it twice. - We couldn't dream of it.
###1089 Do you know what we'd like to do in London?
###1092 Anything. Anything. Please name it.
###1094 Just stay right here with all of you.
###1105 Oh, here's Manny in the paddling pool.
###1109 So much body hair for a seven-year-old.
###1112 Remember, the doctors were always ringing up.
###1115 They offered us a lot of money to show you at the university.
###1121 Ooh, mmm. Well, what a day that was.
###1124 Absolutely packed with fun-stuffed memories.
###1128 But I'm off to bed now. Thank you.
###1130 (Yawns) Me too. I can barely keep my eyes open. I'll go home and crash. Bye.
###1136 - It's one in the afternoon. - Is it? Oh, Christ.
###1139 Oh, and here's Manny on his tricycle.
###1143 Oh, that's stuck up in the loft now.
###1145 Wouldn't it be lovely if somebody else could use it.
###1148 (Moo-Ma) Wouldn't it be lovely?
###1152 # Pardon me, boy Is that the Chattanooga choo-choo? #
###1157 - (Humming melody) - Manny, can you help us through here?
###1161 - Won't take a moment. - Righto. I'll just...
###1168 Oh!
###1170 (Choking)
###1174 Unless they go in the next hour,
###1176 I will tell your mother I am a psycho-biker-junkie whore.
###1180 - It's just for the weekend. - Not another hour. Not another minute.
###1184 I am about to stop playing "who shall I kill first?"
###1187 And just go for what feels natural.
###1190 I think I'll start with me, then it's you.
###1194 - Make them go. - (Manny breathing heavily)
###1198 (Chokes)
###1209 Erm...
###1210 it, er... it's a shame that you won't be able to stay.
###1214 - Isn't it? - Yes, especially as we don't need to go.
###1218 We don't need to go till Wednesday.
###1220 Oh. I'm sorry, that sounds like we're imposing.
###1224 Oh. No. Erm, no.
###1226 Would... Would you... Would you like to... to stay till... till Wednesday?
###1231 - If it's no trouble. - Wonderful.
###1233 (Giggling) Yes!
###1236 (Squeaking) Yeah. I'll just...
###1243 - And? - Erm...
###1245 - Well, the thing is... - Yes?
###1248 They've gone!
###1251 Er, I told them to go... and they went.
###1254 (Both sigh)
###1258 Oh, I feel a bit bad now. Still, it's too late to change it.
###1261 Well! If I'm going to be here till Wednesday,
###1264 I can get cracking on this sink!
###1268 I think I'll need my multi-tool.
###1270 Have you got a multi-tool, Bernard? Couldn't live without mine.
###1279 How long did you think that was going to last, Manny?
###1283 I was hoping for about five minutes.
###1288 - Ah! - (Slap)
###1299 Moo-Ma, Moo-Pa.
###1302 The thing is, I haven't been completely straight with you.
###1306 See... I'm not a partner in the company.
###1310 And... Fran...
###1312 isn't my girlfriend.
###1315 I'm just a bloke that works in a bookshop
###1317 and spends his evenings eating cereal.
###1323 And I know you'll be angry with me and you'll want to go.
###1326 Oh, Manny, you don't have to invent things to make us happy.
###1332 - We love you whatever you do. - Well...
###1335 Erm, bearing that in mind,
###1338 could you go now, please?
###1340 We are terribly busy.
###1351 Sorry. That's just how it is.
###1353 Well, I'm sorry to hear that, Manny.
###1355 - We'd better head off, then. - We wouldn't want to be a burden.
###1359 Especially not to you.
###1361 Your mother was busy raising you when she gave up her job.
###1367 They wouldn't take her back, you know.
###1370 (Moo-Ma) Come along, darling.
###1372 - Manny's busy. - Mm.
###1375 No, no. We all need a proper chance to catch up.
###1378 It's too difficult here in London. Why don't I come up to you?
###1382 - I could have a holiday, couldn't I? - Sure. Take the week.
###1385 Well, it's a deal, then.
###1387 Auntie Nora will be there. And Auntie Dora, of course.
###1391 - See you then, darling. - Bye, Moo-Ma.
###1393 - Ha-ha-ha-haaa! - Bye. Ha.
###1397 (Manny) Bye.
###1401 (Sighs)
###1403 Well, they're gone.
###1406 OK?
###1407 Yeah.
###1411 Just imagine, you'll get a whole week with them, all to yourself.
###1416 Heh-heh.
###1421 - (Manny) Noooo! - (Fingers cracking)
###1424 - (# Both hum Chattanooga Choo-Choo) - A week! A week! What have I done?
###1430 - (Moaning) - # Pardon me, boy
###1433 # Is that the Chattanooga choo-choo #
