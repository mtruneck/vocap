1
0:0:5,607 --> 0:0:7,607
What are you doing?


2
0:0:7,607 --> 0:0:9,727
Wondering how to tell my roommate


3
0:0:9,727 --> 0:0:12,767
he drives me crazy,
without hurting his feelings.


4
0:0:12,767 --> 0:0:15,127
Sarcasm works better
when it's shorter.


5
0:0:15,127 --> 0:0:18,567
- Fascinating.
- See, there you go.


6
0:0:18,567 --> 0:0:20,407
So what're you doing?


7
0:0:20,407 --> 0:0:23,607
- You're annoying me.
- l'm OK with it.


8
0:0:23,607 --> 0:0:27,567
l've had such a crappy morning l decided
to come out here and eat my lunch.


9
0:0:27,567 --> 0:0:31,327
This spot feels secluded.
lt's so peaceful.


10
0:0:31,327 --> 0:0:33,207
l'm getting my spirit back.


11
0:0:33,207 --> 0:0:46,327
- lt's just a bench.
- Sit down, sweet thang.


12
0:0:46,327 --> 0:0:50,87
Nice. You know, l've already eaten,
but l could...


13
0:0:50,87 --> 0:0:54,687
- What's it gonna take?
- Your cupcake.


14
0:0:54,687 --> 0:1:2,607
This is how l get my spirit back.


15
0:1:2,607 --> 0:1:11,807
l feel alive again.


16
0:1:11,807 --> 0:1:15,407
<i>It's time to change this pattern,</i>


17
0:1:15,407 --> 0:1:17,927
- Morning.
- How do you figure?


18
0:1:17,927 --> 0:1:20,847
Doing a little drilling?


19
0:1:20,847 --> 0:1:24,887
l have an idea. Let's go the whole day
without getting in each other's hair.


20
0:1:24,887 --> 0:1:28,967
Just give each other a break?
What do you say?


21
0:1:28,967 --> 0:1:31,367
l'm gonna give you a nickname.


22
0:1:31,367 --> 0:1:35,767
That's good.
l already have a nickname. lt's JD.


23
0:1:35,767 --> 0:1:40,887
How about... Whinyface?


24
0:1:40,887 --> 0:1:42,527
Whinybritches?


25
0:1:42,527 --> 0:1:46,287
Whinysomething.
l definitely like whiny.


26
0:1:46,287 --> 0:2:5,567
Whinydancer.


27
0:2:5,567 --> 0:2:8,87
l can't believe
l went out last night.


28
0:2:8,87 --> 0:2:10,167
You said you were exhausted.


29
0:2:10,167 --> 0:2:13,167
l was.
But l figured l owed it to the ladies.


30
0:2:13,167 --> 0:2:15,487
Do you ever stop giving?


31
0:2:15,487 --> 0:2:19,47
<i>It's hard for doctors and nurses</i>
<i>to be long-term friends,</i>


32
0:2:19,47 --> 0:2:22,847
His O2-sat's dropping.
He just needs respiratory treatment.


33
0:2:22,847 --> 0:2:25,727
<i>When you start out</i>
<i>the nurses know more than you,</i>


34
0:2:25,727 --> 0:2:30,567
<i>After a few months the training kicks</i>
<i>in and you both feel the dynamic shift,</i>


35
0:2:30,567 --> 0:2:37,487
l think because of the congestive
heart failure, he just needs Lasix.


36
0:2:37,487 --> 0:2:41,567
<i>The future of the relationship depends</i>
<i>on how she handles that very moment,</i>


37
0:2:41,567 --> 0:2:45,87
l'm so proud of you, Bambi.


38
0:2:45,87 --> 0:3:2,207
They grow up so fast.


39
0:3:2,207 --> 0:3:4,687
- Dr Cox.
- And there you are.


40
0:3:4,687 --> 0:3:8,327
- Excuse me?
- l was wondering if there's anything


41
0:3:8,327 --> 0:3:11,567
that could push my headache
into a full-blown migraine.


42
0:3:11,567 --> 0:3:13,967
And there you are.


43
0:3:13,967 --> 0:3:18,127
- What's the story on the admit in 64?
- She's great. l really like her.


44
0:3:18,127 --> 0:3:22,367
Let's see if you can't focus on things
l give a rat's ass about.


45
0:3:22,367 --> 0:3:23,447
What?


46
0:3:23,447 --> 0:3:26,287
She blacked out at work.
Accelerated heartbeat.


47
0:3:26,287 --> 0:3:27,607
lnteresting.


48
0:3:27,607 --> 0:3:30,647
l don't care if it wasn't
good first-date conversation,


49
0:3:30,647 --> 0:3:35,767
Michael deserved to know what
l think about circumcising babies.


50
0:3:35,767 --> 0:3:37,367
What? Actually, no.


51
0:3:37,367 --> 0:3:40,607
No, it wasn't, which is
surprising cos he's Jewish.


52
0:3:40,607 --> 0:3:44,127
- l gave her two Valium.
- l'm e-mailing you as we're talking.


53
0:3:44,127 --> 0:3:46,327
How cool is that?


54
0:3:46,327 --> 0:3:48,807
So she's actually sedated as we speak?


55
0:3:48,807 --> 0:3:49,927
OK, bye.


56
0:3:49,927 --> 0:3:52,167
Elliot. OK, first impressions.


57
0:3:52,167 --> 0:3:54,287
- Did l scare Michael off?
- No.


58
0:3:54,287 --> 0:3:58,7
Not if he enjoys a big fat cup of crazy.


59
0:3:58,7 --> 0:4:1,247
Ms Tracy, we're all busy,
so if we could...


60
0:4:1,247 --> 0:4:3,767
l have the same e-maily-pagey thingy.


61
0:4:3,767 --> 0:4:8,207
Get out!


62
0:4:8,207 --> 0:4:13,727
- My H sticks a little bit. Does yours?
- lt does!


63
0:4:13,727 --> 0:4:16,767
lt may just be a bench,
but you know what?


64
0:4:16,767 --> 0:4:21,7
lt's quiet. And l can chill.
lt's like my special place.


65
0:4:21,7 --> 0:4:23,967
You are so damn cute,
l can't even stand it.


66
0:4:23,967 --> 0:4:25,247
Serious?


67
0:4:25,247 --> 0:4:28,47
l love it that my man's
all deep and whatnot.


68
0:4:28,47 --> 0:4:30,247
- You know, l get deep.
- l know.


69
0:4:30,247 --> 0:4:36,47
- What's happening, Rerun?
- What up, Roge?


70
0:4:36,47 --> 0:4:38,127
How about some of this?


71
0:4:38,127 --> 0:4:40,647
lt wasn't even that good a show.


72
0:4:40,647 --> 0:4:43,87
- Take it back.
- This second.


73
0:4:43,87 --> 0:4:47,127
Look at the time.
Gotta go, it's lunchtime.


74
0:4:47,127 --> 0:4:48,607
See ya, baby!


75
0:4:48,607 --> 0:4:52,407
- We still on for the Bresson exhibit?
- Yes, we are.


76
0:4:52,407 --> 0:4:56,407
- Did you just ask out my girlfriend?
- You wanna come?


77
0:4:56,407 --> 0:4:59,527
Black-and-white photography,
no boobies.


78
0:4:59,527 --> 0:5:7,927
Hell, no.


79
0:5:7,927 --> 0:5:10,727
- Hello, sir.
- Nice spot.


80
0:5:10,727 --> 0:5:13,47
Yes, sir.


81
0:5:13,47 --> 0:5:17,207
l usually try to get out here
for lunch every day at 1 2.30.


82
0:5:17,207 --> 0:5:19,207
You don't say?


83
0:5:19,207 --> 0:5:25,287
Every day, 1 2.30, for 23 years.


84
0:5:25,287 --> 0:5:28,127
From now on, your name is Scooter.


85
0:5:28,127 --> 0:5:31,927
- l don't get it.
- Short for scooter pie.


86
0:5:31,927 --> 0:5:35,927
l hate scooter pies.


87
0:5:35,927 --> 0:5:38,127
Now l see.


88
0:5:38,127 --> 0:5:39,527
<i>You big jerk,</i>


89
0:5:39,527 --> 0:5:42,887
Thanks again for the invite, Bambi.
l love photography.


90
0:5:42,887 --> 0:5:48,407
Photography's for studs.


91
0:5:48,407 --> 0:5:52,687
<i>After working at a hospital for a while</i>
<i>you develop a sixth sense for danger,</i>


92
0:5:52,687 --> 0:5:57,807
<i>Maybe there's a mass cas alert</i>
<i>maybe there's a code,,,</i>


93
0:5:57,807 --> 0:5:59,887
<i>Maybe someone spent the morning</i>


94
0:5:59,887 --> 0:6:3,287
<i>with an annoying patient</i>
<i>and needs to vent,</i>


95
0:6:3,287 --> 0:6:6,767
<i>Luckily I was prepared,</i>


96
0:6:6,767 --> 0:6:8,527
- You do your pre-rounds?
- Yes.


97
0:6:8,527 --> 0:6:11,167
Discharge summaries?
Pharmacy renewals?


98
0:6:11,167 --> 0:6:13,767
SOAP notes?
Central line changes?


99
0:6:13,767 --> 0:6:14,847
Yes.


100
0:6:14,847 --> 0:6:18,447
OK, but did you
go ahead and fix your beeper


101
0:6:18,447 --> 0:6:24,167
so it doesn't play that annoying
song every time you get paged?


102
0:6:24,167 --> 0:6:26,247
Yes.


103
0:6:26,247 --> 0:6:30,807
<i>Crap,</i>


104
0:6:30,807 --> 0:6:32,767
l expect you to act like


105
0:6:32,767 --> 0:6:35,807
a professional around here!


106
0:6:35,807 --> 0:6:39,287
ls that all you got?


107
0:6:39,287 --> 0:6:44,47
Good one.


108
0:6:44,47 --> 0:6:46,127
lnteresting titbit.


109
0:6:46,127 --> 0:6:49,207
Back during the gold rush
when a man staked a claim,


110
0:6:49,207 --> 0:6:51,967
if he came upon another man
panning his spot,


111
0:6:51,967 --> 0:6:54,727
he could shoot that fella dead


112
0:6:54,727 --> 0:6:57,647
without even asking any questions.


113
0:6:57,647 --> 0:7:0,367
You don't say.


114
0:7:0,367 --> 0:7:5,567
Simpler times.


115
0:7:5,567 --> 0:7:9,167
What if you've had three great dates
and he likes you so much


116
0:7:9,167 --> 0:7:12,287
he hasn't even tried to have sex
with you yet?


117
0:7:12,287 --> 0:7:15,407
l could sabotage that relationship
in two phone calls.


118
0:7:15,407 --> 0:7:18,847
- l could do it in one.
- Sabotage that relationship.


119
0:7:18,847 --> 0:7:21,647
l would ask him
why he finds me so repulsive.


120
0:7:21,647 --> 0:7:24,207
Then, coerce him
into having phone sex with me,


121
0:7:24,207 --> 0:7:27,287
then l would ask him
if he thinks we have a future,


122
0:7:27,287 --> 0:7:30,847
and then l'd probably just cry
until he hung up on me.


123
0:7:30,847 --> 0:7:33,527
- We are so alike.
- l know!


124
0:7:33,527 --> 0:7:36,567
''Oh, stop.'' ''No, you stop.''


125
0:7:36,567 --> 0:7:40,87
Oh, dear God.


126
0:7:40,87 --> 0:7:43,927
- Ms Tracy, we'll go ahead...
- Can you give me one sec?


127
0:7:43,927 --> 0:7:48,207
l'm arranging to have food delivered.
Fatty had a party and nobody came.


128
0:7:48,207 --> 0:7:51,927
Preaching to the choir.


129
0:7:51,927 --> 0:7:54,727
Think of what little patience l have


130
0:7:54,727 --> 0:7:58,7
as your virginity.


131
0:7:58,7 --> 0:8:1,167
You always thought it would
be there until that night


132
0:8:1,167 --> 0:8:3,647
when you were feeling down,


133
0:8:3,647 --> 0:8:6,527
and your pal, Kevin,
who just wanted to be friends,


134
0:8:6,527 --> 0:8:10,47
he dropped by and he brought
a copy of 'About Last Night'


135
0:8:10,47 --> 0:8:14,807
and a four-pack of Bartles & Jaymes.
And...


136
0:8:14,807 --> 0:8:18,767
lt was gone for ever.
Just like my patience is now.


137
0:8:18,767 --> 0:8:22,247
So you do scary little speeches?


138
0:8:22,247 --> 0:8:25,967
- How adorable!
- This is so much fun.


139
0:8:25,967 --> 0:8:29,927
Careful, Rapunzel.
Fun time is officially over.


140
0:8:29,927 --> 0:8:33,367
You think you can just treat Bambi
like that and walk away?


141
0:8:33,367 --> 0:8:35,767
Get him, girlfriend.


142
0:8:35,767 --> 0:8:38,127
What up, T-Dog?


143
0:8:38,127 --> 0:8:40,687
<i>The only way to avoid</i>
<i>the high five with Todd</i>


144
0:8:40,687 --> 0:8:43,687
<i>is not to say anything</i>
<i>that he can connect to sex,</i>


145
0:8:43,687 --> 0:8:46,127
How you doing?


146
0:8:46,127 --> 0:8:54,767
That's totally how my car was rocking
when l took this girl out last night.


147
0:8:54,767 --> 0:8:56,927
Am l right?


148
0:8:56,927 --> 0:9:0,327
<i>He earned it,</i>


149
0:9:0,327 --> 0:9:1,567
Pain.


150
0:9:1,567 --> 0:9:5,7
- So Cox tore into you?
- You know what pisses me off?


151
0:9:5,7 --> 0:9:7,7
No one ever calls him on anything.


152
0:9:7,7 --> 0:9:9,647
You want to kick and scream,


153
0:9:9,647 --> 0:9:13,687
that's fine, but if you ever yell
at my friend again over nothing,


154
0:9:13,687 --> 0:9:16,687
then l will wipe
that scary smile off your face,


155
0:9:16,687 --> 0:9:19,247
and keep it in my purse
until no one around here


156
0:9:19,247 --> 0:9:21,127
is any more scared of you than l am.


157
0:9:21,127 --> 0:9:25,727
lt's not fair.
Why are you eating in here?


158
0:9:25,727 --> 0:9:29,767
- T-man's afraid of Kelso.
- l'm not afraid of Kelso.


159
0:9:29,767 --> 0:9:31,967
l just felt like eating in here.


160
0:9:31,967 --> 0:9:35,567
Go outside and stand up for yourself.


161
0:9:35,567 --> 0:9:39,887
Hell, yeah.


162
0:9:39,887 --> 0:9:43,287
You know what else
stands up for itself?


163
0:9:43,287 --> 0:9:47,287
l'm not sure.
But l'll guess that it's your penis.


164
0:9:47,287 --> 0:9:48,847
lt is.


165
0:9:48,847 --> 0:9:50,887
<i>Oh no,</i>


166
0:9:50,887 --> 0:9:54,567
Everyone, we can all relax now.
The planets have been realigned


167
0:9:54,567 --> 0:9:57,207
and order shall be returned.
Hey, you.


168
0:9:57,207 --> 0:10:0,327
Give me two seconds.
Gotta finish e-mailing Jill.


169
0:10:0,327 --> 0:10:3,7
l have
your little friend's test results.


170
0:10:3,7 --> 0:10:5,367
Shall we have some fun
and take a look?


171
0:10:5,367 --> 0:10:9,207
lnteresting. EKG, negative.
Tilt table, negative.


172
0:10:9,207 --> 0:10:11,567
Echo, negative.


173
0:10:11,567 --> 0:10:16,967
Nothing, in fact, is wrong with her
but exhaustion, brought on by...


174
0:10:16,967 --> 0:10:19,847
let it come... being her.


175
0:10:19,847 --> 0:10:23,487
- Yeah, but if you don't...
- No, no, no.


176
0:10:23,487 --> 0:10:25,647
There's no time for ''Yeah, buts''.


177
0:10:25,647 --> 0:10:28,207
l want her out of here in five minutes


178
0:10:28,207 --> 0:10:31,607
or you will be responsible
for covering every missed shift


179
0:10:31,607 --> 0:10:34,7
during this year's flu season.


180
0:10:34,7 --> 0:10:36,327
Now go.


181
0:10:36,327 --> 0:10:38,687
Hey, you...


182
0:10:38,687 --> 0:10:43,7
For what it's worth,
l don't care if your beeper plays


183
0:10:43,7 --> 0:10:45,807
<i>Who let the dogs out?</i>
<i>Hoof hoof</i>


184
0:10:45,807 --> 0:10:49,327
- as many times as you like.
- Actually, sir, it's ''who, who''.


185
0:10:49,327 --> 0:10:53,127
- But thank you.
- And, by the way,


186
0:10:53,127 --> 0:10:56,807
just a real smooth move
running to your mommy.


187
0:10:56,807 --> 0:11:0,767
- Excuse me?
- Your mommy cr-rushed me.


188
0:11:0,767 --> 0:11:3,767
She did. l'd like to issue
a warning to everybody,


189
0:11:3,767 --> 0:11:5,807
and l'm dead serious.


190
0:11:5,807 --> 0:11:9,87
FYl: JD's mommy
has made it clear


191
0:11:9,87 --> 0:11:12,207
that she doesn't want her
daughter picked on any more.


192
0:11:12,207 --> 0:11:32,807
Nothing mean. She's a precious flower
and we should all be super nice to her.


193
0:11:32,807 --> 0:11:35,87
l was paged.


194
0:11:35,87 --> 0:11:36,327
Hello?


195
0:11:36,327 --> 0:11:38,247
Anyone?


196
0:11:38,247 --> 0:11:44,287
Oh, hell, no!


197
0:11:44,287 --> 0:11:46,487
When l get out, we should hang.


198
0:11:46,487 --> 0:11:48,407
l'd love to. l should warn you,


199
0:11:48,407 --> 0:11:51,487
l work a ton and when l'm off,
l catch up on paperwork


200
0:11:51,487 --> 0:11:54,647
or read medical journals
to stay ahead of the curve.


201
0:11:54,647 --> 0:11:56,87
l'm a nerd.


202
0:11:56,87 --> 0:11:59,847
l wish l could stay home and read,
but my job, it's like, you know?


203
0:11:59,847 --> 0:12:4,927
With the married-by-the-millennium
thing, l go on like, 1 ,000 blind dates.


204
0:12:4,927 --> 0:12:7,847
And all my friends
always need something.


205
0:12:7,847 --> 0:12:13,407
There's me who never wants to
let anyone down, you know, ever.


206
0:12:13,407 --> 0:12:19,967
With so many balls in the air, sometimes
it gets a little overwhelming.


207
0:12:19,967 --> 0:12:25,847
As soon as l leave, l know
l'm going right back to that mess.


208
0:12:25,847 --> 0:12:31,447
My God, l'm practically crying.
How pathetic is that?


209
0:12:31,447 --> 0:12:34,207
<i>Around here</i>
<i>you make big choices every day,</i>


210
0:12:34,207 --> 0:12:36,807
l came to tell you
we're gonna keep you here


211
0:12:36,807 --> 0:12:40,167
for the weekend, just to get some rest.


212
0:12:40,167 --> 0:12:44,607
<i>Most of these choices actually</i>
<i>have nothing to do with medicine,</i>


213
0:12:44,607 --> 0:12:46,847
lt's so on.


214
0:12:46,847 --> 0:12:48,967
<i>In those cases you have to make sure</i>


215
0:12:48,967 --> 0:12:52,807
<i>that your emotions</i>
<i>don't get the best of you,</i>


216
0:12:52,807 --> 0:12:57,207
<i>Mommy,</i>


217
0:12:57,207 --> 0:13:1,527
- Give me that, Bambi, that's not a toy.
- My name is not Bambi.


218
0:13:1,527 --> 0:13:5,247
lt's Dr Dorian.
l don't need to be looked after.


219
0:13:5,247 --> 0:13:9,927
How about l'll be the doctor
and you be the nurse.


220
0:13:9,927 --> 0:13:11,847
Yes, doctor.


221
0:13:11,847 --> 0:13:21,327
<i>Good choice,</i>


222
0:13:21,327 --> 0:13:23,767
l have to go check on something.


223
0:13:23,767 --> 0:13:26,7
<i>Fix this before word gets around,</i>


224
0:13:26,7 --> 0:13:27,207
Carla, wait.


225
0:13:27,207 --> 0:13:29,87
What did you do?


226
0:13:29,87 --> 0:13:33,727
- What did you do?
- What did you do?


227
0:13:33,727 --> 0:13:36,287
She called me Bambi
in front of everyone.


228
0:13:36,287 --> 0:13:41,687
- My name is not Bambi!
- lt's Scooter!


229
0:13:41,687 --> 0:13:44,607
Short for scooter pie.


230
0:13:44,607 --> 0:13:46,927
Baby, JD is my best friend,


231
0:13:46,927 --> 0:13:51,567
but if you need me to kick his ass,
l will kick his ass, cos l care for you.


232
0:13:51,567 --> 0:13:55,407
- And cos l'm willing to sleep with you.
- Hell, yeah.


233
0:13:55,407 --> 0:14:0,367
lf l wanted
his ass kicked l'd do it myself.


234
0:14:0,367 --> 0:14:2,807
Todd,


235
0:14:2,807 --> 0:14:5,167
if you ever make that noise at me again,


236
0:14:5,167 --> 0:14:8,87
l will reach into your mouth
and unscrew that bulb


237
0:14:8,87 --> 0:14:12,527
that barely keeps your brain going.


238
0:14:12,527 --> 0:14:15,367
Dude, chick threats are hot.


239
0:14:15,367 --> 0:14:17,567
What did l say about annoying Carla?


240
0:14:17,567 --> 0:14:21,247
lf she makes me choose between you two,
you know how it'll end up.


241
0:14:21,247 --> 0:14:28,207
Yes, l do. And l thank you for that.


242
0:14:28,207 --> 0:14:31,47
Could you be any cuter
with the new hair colour?


243
0:14:31,47 --> 0:14:35,967
Holy cow! Please, no.


244
0:14:35,967 --> 0:14:39,167
Good morning, sunshine.


245
0:14:39,167 --> 0:14:46,127
Could you possibly
excuse me for just one second?


246
0:14:46,127 --> 0:14:48,207
Dear God, you're still here.


247
0:14:48,207 --> 0:14:52,207
Who exactly is doing this to me?


248
0:14:52,207 --> 0:14:55,527
<i>There's nothing worse than</i>
<i>knowing you've wronged a friend</i>


249
0:14:55,527 --> 0:14:58,7
<i>and having to apologise,</i>


250
0:14:58,7 --> 0:15:1,47
- Look, Carla...
- lt's OK. You overreacted.


251
0:15:1,47 --> 0:15:4,287
l should've realised
you can stand up for yourself.


252
0:15:4,287 --> 0:15:7,527
l know you would take it back
if you could. l do.


253
0:15:7,527 --> 0:15:9,487
We're OK, right?


254
0:15:9,487 --> 0:15:13,7
- l think l've said all l can.
- See you tonight for the exhibit.


255
0:15:13,7 --> 0:15:17,247
- Why'd you have me paged?
- To ask you to forgive me.


256
0:15:17,247 --> 0:15:18,847
For what?


257
0:15:18,847 --> 0:15:21,407
Hello, sad clown.


258
0:15:21,407 --> 0:15:24,487
- Thanks for paging her.
- How could you?


259
0:15:24,487 --> 0:15:28,287
He called me cutie and said my eyes
were as blue as the ocean.


260
0:15:28,287 --> 0:15:31,807
l got confused.


261
0:15:31,807 --> 0:15:37,807
- lt probably would've worked on me too.
- You're damn right it would've. Come.


262
0:15:37,807 --> 0:15:39,767
ls he single?


263
0:15:39,767 --> 0:15:41,7
Hello?


264
0:15:41,7 --> 0:15:44,7
Look at you, all proud.


265
0:15:44,7 --> 0:15:46,727
Don't tell me
you've already managed to eat?


266
0:15:46,727 --> 0:15:51,327
l took my sweet time, too.


267
0:15:51,327 --> 0:15:55,247
Consider that your last supper.
l'm bored with the games.


268
0:15:55,247 --> 0:15:59,407
- Are you forbidding me to sit here?
- This is a public bench.


269
0:15:59,407 --> 0:16:3,407
You are as welcome here as l am
but you won't come back again.


270
0:16:3,407 --> 0:16:8,607
You know why? Because you
just don't have the mettle.


271
0:16:8,607 --> 0:16:12,207
Now get out of here so l can
eat my wife's egg salad sandwich


272
0:16:12,207 --> 0:16:19,807
before the tomato
soaks through the bread.


273
0:16:19,807 --> 0:16:24,647
Beautiful day.


274
0:16:24,647 --> 0:16:28,327
Did you get into photography
when you were in college or...?


275
0:16:28,327 --> 0:16:33,687
No. Actually, l never went to college.


276
0:16:33,687 --> 0:16:38,727
Don't tell any of my patients
but neither did l.


277
0:16:38,727 --> 0:16:41,287
ls that supposed
to make me feel better?


278
0:16:41,287 --> 0:16:43,807
No, it was just a joke.


279
0:16:43,807 --> 0:16:47,767
l was doing the whole, like,
turn a frown upside-down.


280
0:16:47,767 --> 0:16:51,407
You know what? Hold it.
l don't think we're OK.


281
0:16:51,407 --> 0:16:54,287
You accepted my apology.
You can't take it back.


282
0:16:54,287 --> 0:17:3,727
Have you ever spent time with a woman?


283
0:17:3,727 --> 0:17:8,527
ls my punishment still coming
because the anticipation is killing me?


284
0:17:8,527 --> 0:17:11,247
- Make your case.
- l'm sorry, what?


285
0:17:11,247 --> 0:17:13,647
Well, you tell me
why Chorey McCrazy Chore


286
0:17:13,647 --> 0:17:16,247
gets to stay here two more nights.


287
0:17:16,247 --> 0:17:17,767
OK.


288
0:17:17,767 --> 0:17:21,527
You don't know how hard it is
for some women to make it alone.


289
0:17:21,527 --> 0:17:25,247
Jill is so exhausted.
She's her own worst enemy.


290
0:17:25,247 --> 0:17:29,287
Constantly trying to please.
She judges herself harsher than anyone.


291
0:17:29,287 --> 0:17:31,927
Have you seen
what you look like today?


292
0:17:31,927 --> 0:17:34,887
l'm a skank.
She never says no to anyone, so...


293
0:17:34,887 --> 0:17:40,167
Could you pick up a sample of my dog's
stool and take it to the vet for me?


294
0:17:40,167 --> 0:17:44,527
l can do it at lunch.


295
0:17:44,527 --> 0:17:47,847
lt's OK.
Jill can stay a little longer.


296
0:17:47,847 --> 0:17:51,327
And if we're real lucky,
she'll realise that it's OK


297
0:17:51,327 --> 0:18:6,7
to give yourself a break
every once in a while, right?


298
0:18:6,7 --> 0:18:8,447
l took a cab from the last stop.


299
0:18:8,447 --> 0:18:11,407
- You forgot your coat.
- l don't want it.


300
0:18:11,407 --> 0:18:14,327
Why would you?


301
0:18:14,327 --> 0:18:16,407
l was only gonna go to that exhibit


302
0:18:16,407 --> 0:18:19,567
because l wanted you to think
l was brainy.


303
0:18:19,567 --> 0:18:23,7
- l'm so angry at myself.
- Thank goodness.


304
0:18:23,7 --> 0:18:25,47
l thought you were mad at me.


305
0:18:25,47 --> 0:18:29,367
Hundreds of interns have decided they
don't need me any more. Why should...?


306
0:18:29,367 --> 0:18:32,567
This is why you can't
be friends with doctors.


307
0:18:32,567 --> 0:18:36,207
lf it's a problem, you, me,
Elliot and Turk will get together...


308
0:18:36,207 --> 0:18:39,47
l don't work with Turk and
l'm not close to Elliot.


309
0:18:39,47 --> 0:18:43,807
The only problem here is you, OK?


310
0:18:43,807 --> 0:18:46,407
We're supposed to be friends.


311
0:18:46,407 --> 0:18:50,47
Your self-esteem
is so wrapped up in what you do.


312
0:18:50,47 --> 0:18:53,527
A doctor. That's all you are.
That's how you define yourself.


313
0:18:53,527 --> 0:18:56,207
You think you're
better than me because of it.


314
0:18:56,207 --> 0:18:58,647
- Carla, l do not think...
- Admit it.


315
0:18:58,647 --> 0:19:3,447
Admit it right now
or l'll never respect you again.


316
0:19:3,447 --> 0:19:8,607
OK. Sometimes that's true.


317
0:19:8,607 --> 0:19:12,967
- Carla, you're a good nurse.
- l'm a great nurse.


318
0:19:12,967 --> 0:19:17,487
You patronising ass.


319
0:19:17,487 --> 0:19:20,927
You don't even get it, do you?


320
0:19:20,927 --> 0:19:23,847
ln nine years, l never once
felt bad about myself


321
0:19:23,847 --> 0:19:26,367
for what l do, not for one second.


322
0:19:26,367 --> 0:19:30,7
And then l met you.


323
0:19:30,7 --> 0:20:6,87
- Please wait.
- Don't.


324
0:20:6,87 --> 0:20:9,207
<i>Sometimes the only way to</i>
<i>take a good look at yourself</i>


325
0:20:9,207 --> 0:20:13,247
<i>is through someone else's eyes,</i>


326
0:20:13,247 --> 0:20:23,447
<i>If you're lucky</i>
<i>you'll like what you see,</i>


327
0:20:23,447 --> 0:20:28,567
lmpressive.


328
0:20:28,567 --> 0:20:33,807
<i>Or you'll learn from it,</i>


329
0:20:33,807 --> 0:20:35,887
<i>If you don't like what you see</i>


330
0:20:35,887 --> 0:20:39,7
<i>you have to hope</i>
<i>you haven't burned too many bridges,</i>


331
0:20:39,7 --> 0:20:42,647
How many mEqs of potassium
should l give this guy?


332
0:20:42,647 --> 0:20:49,287
You know the answer to that.
Don't do that.


333
0:20:49,287 --> 0:20:52,287
But thanks, Bambi.


334
0:20:52,287 --> 0:20:55,247
<i>From that moment on</i>
<i>I knew I'd be Bambi for ever,</i>


335
0:20:55,247 --> 0:21:1,327
See you tomorrow, Scooter.


336
0:21:1,327 --> 0:23:1,327
<i>He's actually very talented,</i>
