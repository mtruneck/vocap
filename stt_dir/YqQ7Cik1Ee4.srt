0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:10,23



2
0:0:10,23 --> 0:0:12,38
CHRIS ENGELSMAN: There's the
cover of Issue Number One with


3
0:0:12,38 --> 0:0:13,63
Damian on there.


4
0:0:13,63 --> 0:0:16,7



5
0:0:16,7 --> 0:0:17,44
Kind of funny.


6
0:0:17,44 --> 0:0:20,22
Hardboots, stretch OP.


7
0:0:20,22 --> 0:0:22,93
A lot of people probably didn't
realize that they did


8
0:0:22,93 --> 0:0:25,73
all kinds of relief cuts in
their boots and different


9
0:0:25,73 --> 0:0:29,0
things like that so they could
tweak in them and do some


10
0:0:29,0 --> 0:0:33,55
insane stalefishes, and
tailfishes and cross-rockets


11
0:0:33,55 --> 0:0:36,3
and Lien Draculas, you know.


12
0:0:36,3 --> 0:0:38,64
Tricks du jour back
in the day.


13
0:0:38,64 --> 0:0:41,62
TODD RICHARDS: Damian was a
skater too, and obviously he


14
0:0:41,62 --> 0:0:44,57
had the whole correctional boot
thing going, like weird


15
0:0:44,57 --> 0:0:46,19
correctional shoes.


16
0:0:46,19 --> 0:0:47,74
Damian's hardboot thing.


17
0:0:47,74 --> 0:0:52,59
And he was one of four dudes
that wore hardboots and that,


18
0:0:52,59 --> 0:0:53,7
he claimed it so hard.


19
0:0:53,7 --> 0:0:56,25
But he was just like--


20
0:0:56,25 --> 0:0:57,64
Damien was bananas.


21
0:0:57,64 --> 0:1:0,27
DAMIAN SANDERS: Nobody rode
hardboots but our little crew,


22
0:1:0,27 --> 0:1:1,48
and I really don't
even know why.


23
0:1:1,48 --> 0:1:3,74
I just started riding hardboots
and they felt right,


24
0:1:3,74 --> 0:1:5,5
but it really made me a
more powerful rider.


25
0:1:5,5 --> 0:1:8,36
Like I could really stomp things
way more than I could--


26
0:1:8,36 --> 0:1:10,39
because I went back and forth.


27
0:1:10,39 --> 0:1:11,47
Everybody was trying to give
me the right softboots,


28
0:1:11,47 --> 0:1:13,27
thinking I might be a better
snowboarder, and it just


29
0:1:13,27 --> 0:1:14,25
wasn't the case.


30
0:1:14,25 --> 0:1:16,62
I'd get back in my hardboots and
I felt like I could ride


31
0:1:16,62 --> 0:1:19,13
anything and fly off jumps,
twice as big as I could go


32
0:1:19,13 --> 0:1:20,1
with softboots.


33
0:1:20,1 --> 0:1:21,79
When I had softboots on, the
board felt like a toy.


34
0:1:21,79 --> 0:1:23,295
When I had hardboots on,
it felt like a machine.


35
0:1:23,295 --> 0:1:24,35
Like it was connected to me.


36
0:1:24,35 --> 0:1:27,44
When I leaned over, the board
was instantly on an edge, and


37
0:1:27,44 --> 0:1:29,64
I could rest on my boots
to do half the work.


38
0:1:29,64 --> 0:1:31,74
So I could really get
a good power going.


39
0:1:31,74 --> 0:1:33,45
But no one ever caught
onto that.


40
0:1:33,45 --> 0:1:35,81
Koflach was the only company
making the snowboard boots.


41
0:1:35,81 --> 0:1:39,42
It was just Tom, Jim, myself,
Bonnie and Dana, I think, that


42
0:1:39,42 --> 0:1:42,13
were riding hardboots back then,
and everybody else was


43
0:1:42,13 --> 0:1:42,52
on softboots.


44
0:1:42,52 --> 0:1:43,87
The entire industry.


45
0:1:43,87 --> 0:1:44,64
But I'm glad I did.


46
0:1:44,64 --> 0:1:46,77
I mean, they were kind of
goofy-looking, but I could get


47
0:1:46,77 --> 0:1:47,7
so much air on those things.


48
0:1:47,7 --> 0:1:48,99
I loved them.


49
0:1:48,99 --> 0:1:49,71
JERRY DUGAN: He wore
hardboots.


50
0:1:49,71 --> 0:1:50,62
I mean, that was his thing.


51
0:1:50,62 --> 0:1:51,67
He was a hardboot guy.


52
0:1:51,67 --> 0:1:53,63
Him and Dana were
hardboot guys.


53
0:1:53,63 --> 0:1:56,73
But he could tweak his board
and tweak his body in ways


54
0:1:56,73 --> 0:1:59,375
that no one in hardboots has
ever been able to do.


55
0:1:59,375 --> 0:2:1,135
They were behind the whole
hardboot revolution.


56
0:2:1,135 --> 0:2:3,2
Yeah, hardboots, it's the way.


57
0:2:3,2 --> 0:2:5,7
Look, we can tweak everything.


58
0:2:5,7 --> 0:2:6,94
That eventually caught up with
them and didn't work out so


59
0:2:6,94 --> 0:2:8,169
well as things got
a little more


60
0:2:8,169 --> 0:2:9,699
technical and more finessed.


61
0:2:9,699 --> 0:2:13,77
But back in the days of just
big, macho grassers, and


62
0:2:13,77 --> 0:2:18,16
frontsides and stalefish, melon,
backflip, whatever, it


63
0:2:18,16 --> 0:2:19,24
was all pretty OK.


64
0:2:19,24 --> 0:2:20,43
DAMIAN SANDERS: I think if
everybody would've followed


65
0:2:20,43 --> 0:2:22,59
suit with us, snowboarding
would've--


66
0:2:22,59 --> 0:2:23,21
it's hard to tell.


67
0:2:23,21 --> 0:2:26,1
I mean, with these guys that are
ripping freestyle riders,


68
0:2:26,1 --> 0:2:28,3
they might want that
flexibility, but I had my


69
0:2:28,3 --> 0:2:29,83
boots so cut up in
different angles.


70
0:2:29,83 --> 0:2:31,44
I knew exactly what I
needed to cut out


71
0:2:31,44 --> 0:2:32,5
to do certain tricks.


72
0:2:32,5 --> 0:2:34,93
And so I would chop out the
whole inside of the boot so I


73
0:2:34,93 --> 0:2:37,29
could lean away and do Japan
Airs and Crooked Cops and all


74
0:2:37,29 --> 0:2:38,44
those things and--


75
0:2:38,44 --> 0:2:40,29
I mean, I had them cut up
so much they almost were


76
0:2:40,29 --> 0:2:43,44
softboots, but there's just
nothing like that feeling of


77
0:2:43,44 --> 0:2:44,78
the toe and edge response
that you had.


78
0:2:44,78 --> 0:2:45,81
It was insane.


79
0:2:45,81 --> 0:2:47,98
As soon as you thought it,
the board was doing it.


80
0:2:47,98 --> 0:2:49,16
It was amazing.


81
0:2:49,16 --> 0:2:50,86
And in my softboots,
I feel like I'm all


82
0:2:50,86 --> 0:2:52,24
wishy-washy, swimming.


83
0:2:52,24 --> 0:2:54,206
And I've gotten them clamped
down pretty damn tight, and


84
0:2:54,206 --> 0:2:56,115
they're still just not
quite a hardboot.


85
0:2:56,115 --> 0:2:59,53
JEREMY JONES: The thing we got
from Damien was balls and


86
0:2:59,53 --> 0:3:1,8
backflips, pretty much.


87
0:3:1,8 --> 0:3:4,41
The dude would just charge
everything and we always


88
0:3:4,41 --> 0:3:6,69
tripped out that he could
do it on hardboots.


89
0:3:6,69 --> 0:3:8,6
That was a big thing for us.


90
0:3:8,6 --> 0:3:10,8
It was always kind
of mind-blowing.


91
0:3:10,8 --> 0:3:11,83
How does he do that?


92
0:3:11,83 --> 0:3:15,55
Because he would tweak so hard
in hardboots and we never got


93
0:3:15,55 --> 0:3:19,23
in, so there was always the
Damian tweaks and it was


94
0:3:19,23 --> 0:3:21,48
always in our things
we talked about.


95
0:3:21,48 --> 0:3:25,17
It was, like, dude, you tweaked
that like Damien!


96
0:3:25,17 --> 0:3:29,45
So it was speed, and it was size
of airs, and it was the


97
0:3:29,45 --> 0:3:34,63
balls he had to do the
things he was doing.


98
0:3:34,63 --> 0:3:36,47
MIKE McENTIRE: You can never
front on Damian.


99
0:3:36,47 --> 0:3:38,56
There's no way anyone can
ever front on that guy.


100
0:3:38,56 --> 0:3:40,38
He was the original rock star.


101
0:3:40,38 --> 0:3:42,5
He was the guy, dude.


102
0:3:42,5 --> 0:3:43,74
There's no one like that.


103
0:3:43,74 --> 0:3:47,4
And like his lifestyle
and his whole scene.


104
0:3:47,4 --> 0:3:49,55
He had everything
to back it up.


105
0:3:49,55 --> 0:3:51,81
He had this Penthouse
Pet for a wife.


106
0:3:51,81 --> 0:3:55,5
I don't care if he wore neon
green and orange or whatever


107
0:3:55,5 --> 0:3:57,74
his thing was at
the beginning.


108
0:3:57,74 --> 0:3:59,38
What he was doing was
extraordinary.


109
0:3:59,38 --> 0:4:2,71
He was totally way
beyond anyone.


110
0:4:2,71 --> 0:4:4,2
DAMIAN SANDERS: I was a
snowboarder when I was with


111
0:4:4,2 --> 0:4:8,43
Brandy, but I was 19,
20 years old.


112
0:4:8,43 --> 0:4:12,17
And I met her at a nightclub
down here, and we started


113
0:4:12,17 --> 0:4:14,2
going out and the rest is
history, but that lasted for


114
0:4:14,2 --> 0:4:14,78
about five years.


115
0:4:14,78 --> 0:4:15,71
That was a good time.


116
0:4:15,71 --> 0:4:17,47
It was perfect for my snowboard
career, because she


117
0:4:17,47 --> 0:4:19,459
was a superstar, and I was a
superstar in snowboarding, so


118
0:4:19,459 --> 0:4:22,27
it put us together and
it was kind of cool.


119
0:4:22,27 --> 0:4:24,25
JERRY DUGAN: Damien was married
to Brandy for years


120
0:4:24,25 --> 0:4:25,74
and Brandy was a--


121
0:4:25,74 --> 0:4:27,97
she was Penthouse Pet of the
Year, and she for sure got way


122
0:4:27,97 --> 0:4:28,97
more press than we got.


123
0:4:28,97 --> 0:4:32,6
She was way more attractive and
was in bigger magazines


124
0:4:32,6 --> 0:4:35,6
than any of us had been
in at that point.


125
0:4:35,6 --> 0:4:36,58
I do have one great story
about Brandy, though.


126
0:4:36,58 --> 0:4:39,755
So Brandy, she told us that
she spoke Japanese.


127
0:4:39,755 --> 0:4:41,71
She was like, oh, I'm
fluent in Japanese.


128
0:4:41,71 --> 0:4:44,47
And we all look at Damian
and we're like, OK fine.


129
0:4:44,47 --> 0:4:46,83
So we're on, like, the bullet
train going to Hokkaido or


130
0:4:46,83 --> 0:4:49,0
something, and Damian and
Brandy had one of the


131
0:4:49,0 --> 0:4:49,69
magazines out.


132
0:4:49,69 --> 0:4:50,33
And they were sitting there.


133
0:4:50,33 --> 0:4:52,63
I think it was me, Tom Burt,
Damien, Brandy, and


134
0:4:52,63 --> 0:4:53,7
[INAUDIBLE]


135
0:4:53,7 --> 0:4:56,6
and this guy comes up to her
and he looks at her and he


136
0:4:56,6 --> 0:4:58,33
starts going [INAUDIBLE]


137
0:4:58,33 --> 0:5:0,81
and he asks her something
in Japanese.


138
0:5:0,81 --> 0:5:3,58
And she goes, "Hai." Because
it was clear he was asking,


139
0:5:3,58 --> 0:5:5,205
like, oh is that you on the
cover of the magazine?


140
0:5:5,205 --> 0:5:8,18
And it's like some nude girlie
magazine and she goes, "Hai."


141
0:5:8,18 --> 0:5:10,98
And then he asks another
question and she just answers,


142
0:5:10,98 --> 0:5:12,41
"Hai," which means yes.


143
0:5:12,41 --> 0:5:15,72
And at that point, he
just reached down


144
0:5:15,72 --> 0:5:16,873
and grabbed her boob.


145
0:5:16,873 --> 0:5:19,92
And we're all just like,
whoa, whoa, whoa!


146
0:5:19,92 --> 0:5:21,408
We jump up, pushed the
guy off, and we're


147
0:5:21,408 --> 0:5:21,948
like, hey, hey, hey!


148
0:5:21,948 --> 0:5:23,16
No, no, no!


149
0:5:23,16 --> 0:5:27,68
And our Japanese guide said, oh,
he asked if that was you


150
0:5:27,68 --> 0:5:30,625
on the magazine and you said
yes, and then he asked if


151
0:5:30,625 --> 0:5:32,95
those were your boobs, and you
said yes, and then he asked


152
0:5:32,95 --> 0:5:36,63
you if he could touch them
and you said yes!


153
0:5:36,63 --> 0:5:39,81
Like that Japanese is working
really good for you, Brandy.


154
0:5:39,81 --> 0:5:42,82
STEVE GRAHAM: Damian and Brandy
were still an item, and


155
0:5:42,82 --> 0:5:45,16
so I'm supposed to meet them at
the beach-- this is down in


156
0:5:45,16 --> 0:5:49,78
Huntington-- and I see this
Mexican guy, just kind of


157
0:5:49,78 --> 0:5:52,404
looking like this, looking
over, and I'm like, man,


158
0:5:52,404 --> 0:5:53,65
what's that guy looking at?


159
0:5:53,65 --> 0:5:55,27
And I just, huh, whatever.


160
0:5:55,27 --> 0:5:56,82
And I walk up.


161
0:5:56,82 --> 0:5:58,38
I'm like, hey, what's
going on?


162
0:5:58,38 --> 0:6:0,93
And he says, I'm just checking
out Pocahontas down there.


163
0:6:0,93 --> 0:6:3,19
And I look over and it's Damian
and Brandy and they're


164
0:6:3,19 --> 0:6:8,12
both in G-strings, and
right then, I just--


165
0:6:8,12 --> 0:6:10,7
oh, my God, I start laughing.


166
0:6:10,7 --> 0:6:13,28
And I didn't let the guy know
that I knew them, and I'm


167
0:6:13,28 --> 0:6:14,29
like, yeah, check this out.


168
0:6:14,29 --> 0:6:17,8
So I started going down
there and next thing


169
0:6:17,8 --> 0:6:18,33
you know, I see Damian.


170
0:6:18,33 --> 0:6:21,13
He sees me and just runs around
a rock and changes.


171
0:6:21,13 --> 0:6:23,63
Puts his trunks on and Brandy
just stays the same.


172
0:6:23,63 --> 0:6:27,91
She's probably topless
at the time.


173
0:6:27,91 --> 0:6:30,45
And so I go down there and
next thing you know, I'm


174
0:6:30,45 --> 0:6:32,62
giving her a big hug, and
Damian comes around


175
0:6:32,62 --> 0:6:33,405
and I slap his hand.


176
0:6:33,405 --> 0:6:35,62
And homey on the hill
just, what the?


177
0:6:35,62 --> 0:6:36,8
And he starts to come down.


178
0:6:36,8 --> 0:6:38,706
And I'm all, beat it!


179
0:6:38,706 --> 0:6:40,8
That was Pocahontas.


180
0:6:40,8 --> 0:6:42,92
And sorry, Damian.


181
0:6:42,92 --> 0:6:43,98
Cat's out of the bag, now.


182
0:6:43,98 --> 0:6:46,3
I held it for all those years.


183
0:6:46,3 --> 0:6:48,31
I didn't tell anybody.


184
0:6:48,31 --> 0:6:50,11
MIKE McENTIRE: I got some really
good ones, but they're


185
0:6:50,11 --> 0:6:51,96
kind of, like, x-rated, but--


186
0:6:51,96 --> 0:7:0,77
[LAUGHS]


187
0:7:0,77 --> 0:7:2,14
DAMIAN SANDERS: Farmer and
I were riding together.


188
0:7:2,14 --> 0:7:4,89
We were filming on the
Palisades at Squaw.


189
0:7:4,89 --> 0:7:6,13
We're right underneath
the chairlift.


190
0:7:6,13 --> 0:7:6,995
Everybody on the chairlift
is all, go!


191
0:7:6,995 --> 0:7:7,365
Go!


192
0:7:7,365 --> 0:7:9,52
There's a hundred people
watching us and so, this cliff


193
0:7:9,52 --> 0:7:12,94
was already pretty big,
maybe a 45, 50-footer.


194
0:7:12,94 --> 0:7:15,74
Farmer goes first and he lands
and, kind of, digs this giant


195
0:7:15,74 --> 0:7:17,34
hole and bounces out
and pulls it off.


196
0:7:17,34 --> 0:7:18,92
And so they're ready for me.


197
0:7:18,92 --> 0:7:21,0
I jump and right when I went
off the cliff, I saw that


198
0:7:21,0 --> 0:7:23,6
giant divot and I think, I'm not
going to make it anywhere


199
0:7:23,6 --> 0:7:23,76
but right at that hole.


200
0:7:23,76 --> 0:7:26,43
So I went upside-down and
backwards down the hill and


201
0:7:26,43 --> 0:7:27,86
everything caved in
on top of me.


202
0:7:27,86 --> 0:7:29,68
I'm stuck with this arm behind
my back, this arm is holding


203
0:7:29,68 --> 0:7:31,94
the goggles, and I'm trying to
get the snow out of my mouth,


204
0:7:31,94 --> 0:7:33,26
because all of this snow
is just covering.


205
0:7:33,26 --> 0:7:37,594
I was laying there, totally
compacted with just my face


206
0:7:37,594 --> 0:7:41,83
showing for about four minutes,
and one-half an arm,


207
0:7:41,83 --> 0:7:44,43
flipping around like this.


208
0:7:44,43 --> 0:7:47,28
And I was in a full panic for
10 seconds, and I'm just


209
0:7:47,28 --> 0:7:48,5
wiggling and screaming.


210
0:7:48,5 --> 0:7:48,68
I can't do anything.


211
0:7:48,68 --> 0:7:51,2
I can't get this arm free, and
the board's all twisted and


212
0:7:51,2 --> 0:7:53,34
then I just compacted, and
so it was like cement.


213
0:7:53,34 --> 0:7:54,62
So I wasn't able
to move at all.


214
0:7:54,62 --> 0:7:56,95
And so, when I got just my mouth
uncovered, I'd be able


215
0:7:56,95 --> 0:7:59,15
to start screaming, "help,"
and they were so far down,


216
0:7:59,15 --> 0:7:59,69
they couldn't see me.


217
0:7:59,69 --> 0:8:1,29
So they were all waiting for
me to get myself out.


218
0:8:1,29 --> 0:8:2,62
And that's the worst part,
because I remember sitting


219
0:8:2,62 --> 0:8:5,13
there for about three minutes
before they even started up


220
0:8:5,13 --> 0:8:7,25
the hill, because no one knew
I was really stuck.


221
0:8:7,25 --> 0:8:10,722
-What were you thinking when
you couldn't see anything?


222
0:8:10,722 --> 0:8:12,21
DAMIAN SANDERS: That
I was gonna die.


223
0:8:12,21 --> 0:8:13,698
I was just waiting to die.


224
0:8:13,698 --> 0:8:22,626
[MUSIC]


225
0:8:22,626 --> 0:8:25,8
DAMIAN SANDERS: And my good
buddies, Shawn and Dave, came


226
0:8:25,8 --> 0:8:27,7
to save my life.


227
0:8:27,7 --> 0:8:29,15
First guys on the scene.


228
0:8:29,15 --> 0:8:31,67
Every time I moved, more snow
would fill the hole, right


229
0:8:31,67 --> 0:8:33,44
into where my mouth was.


230
0:8:33,44 --> 0:8:34,799
And so the goggles
are all crooked.


231
0:8:34,799 --> 0:8:35,26
It's pitch dark.


232
0:8:35,26 --> 0:8:37,22
I could see a little bit of
light from the cliff.


233
0:8:37,22 --> 0:8:39,17
And then every time the slow
trickled off the cliff, it


234
0:8:39,17 --> 0:8:40,58
went right into the hole,
right into my mouth.


235
0:8:40,58 --> 0:8:41,97
It was just like clockwork.


236
0:8:41,97 --> 0:8:44,23
So I just stayed there, watching
the snow trickle down


237
0:8:44,23 --> 0:8:45,6
this cliff, going, "No
more, no more snow.


238
0:8:45,6 --> 0:8:47,78
I'm gonna die." And I seriously
was waiting to die,


239
0:8:47,78 --> 0:8:48,78
because I couldn't get
a good breath,


240
0:8:48,78 --> 0:8:49,7
and I was just panting.


241
0:8:49,7 --> 0:8:50,32
I was freaking.


242
0:8:50,32 --> 0:8:51,54
I thought they weren't coming.


243
0:8:51,54 --> 0:8:54,42
And 8 and 1/2 minutes is a long
time to spend suctioned


244
0:8:54,42 --> 0:8:55,8
in there like that.


245
0:8:55,8 --> 0:8:56,5
I was flipping out.


246
0:8:56,5 --> 0:8:59,24
And so finally, I felt the snow
move, and I see Farmer's


247
0:8:59,24 --> 0:9:0,51
head come out there.


248
0:9:0,51 --> 0:9:1,31
Big woolly mammoth.


249
0:9:1,31 --> 0:9:2,186
Big bear head.


250
0:9:2,186 --> 0:9:3,641
And he's all, "Are you all
right?" I'm all, "Get me out


251
0:9:3,641 --> 0:9:6,54
of here, I'm freaking out." He
starts digging my mouth away,


252
0:9:6,54 --> 0:9:9,11
and then he got my hands,
and got me out.


253
0:9:9,11 --> 0:9:10,92
So I really do owe him.


254
0:9:10,92 --> 0:9:14,14
He pretty much saved my life,
there, because I was a snow


255
0:9:14,14 --> 0:9:17,25
chunk away from suffocating.


256
0:9:17,25 --> 0:9:19,27
And so that made me exhausted
as all hell.


257
0:9:19,27 --> 0:9:20,82
But we did end up riding
the rest of the day.


258
0:9:20,82 --> 0:9:23,13
And then every fricking night
I had that nightmare.


259
0:9:23,13 --> 0:9:27,3
Just waking up going, I'm not
buried, I'm not buried.


260
0:9:27,3 --> 0:9:30,89
It was a drag, but it was
cool for the video.


261
0:9:30,89 --> 0:9:32,14
It was good drama.


262
0:9:32,14 --> 0:9:34,6



263
0:9:34,6 --> 0:9:37,44
So it was about seven or eight
good years of just really


264
0:9:37,44 --> 0:9:40,46
power riding, and then five or
seven years of just trickling


265
0:9:40,46 --> 0:9:42,57
and doing it, because I could
still get paid to do it.


266
0:9:42,57 --> 0:9:45,95
DON SZABO: Damien blew out his
knee a couple times, and he


267
0:9:45,95 --> 0:9:48,29
had it rebuilt one time and then
he blew it out again, and


268
0:9:48,29 --> 0:9:50,29
he didn't have it fixed again.


269
0:9:50,29 --> 0:9:53,34
And after that, he started
partying a lot.


270
0:9:53,34 --> 0:9:54,32
DAMIAN SANDERS: I moved
into this big-ass


271
0:9:54,32 --> 0:9:55,5
house on the beach.


272
0:9:55,5 --> 0:9:56,545
It was literally right across
the street from the beach,


273
0:9:56,545 --> 0:9:58,29
so-- just up a few streets.


274
0:9:58,29 --> 0:10:0,44
And we started throwing house
parties, because we had so


275
0:10:0,44 --> 0:10:2,19
many friends in the industry,
with snowboarding, and


276
0:10:2,19 --> 0:10:3,66
motocross, and surfing
all being down


277
0:10:3,66 --> 0:10:5,14
here in the same area.


278
0:10:5,14 --> 0:10:7,79
And the house parties were
always the blast, and then I


279
0:10:7,79 --> 0:10:9,65
had this idea to throw
the Pimp 'N Ho party.


280
0:10:9,65 --> 0:10:12,93
This was probably about '91, I
think, was the first Pimp 'N


281
0:10:12,93 --> 0:10:16,4
Ho, or '92, and everybody
dressed up like pimps and hos.


282
0:10:16,4 --> 0:10:17,56
And back then, we didn't have
a clue what that even meant.


283
0:10:17,56 --> 0:10:18,98
It was so funny.


284
0:10:18,98 --> 0:10:20,78
All the girls we knew were
strippers from the local strip


285
0:10:20,78 --> 0:10:24,27
clubs, so to have a Pimp 'N Ho
party just fit right in.


286
0:10:24,27 --> 0:10:26,32
We all had these ridiculous
outfits and-- with the big


287
0:10:26,32 --> 0:10:28,44
hats, and the feathers, and all
that shit, and then the


288
0:10:28,44 --> 0:10:32,784
girls dressed like total hos,
and it was so much fun.


289
0:10:32,784 --> 0:10:49,98
[LAUGHS]


290
0:10:49,98 --> 0:10:52,53
DAMIAN SANDERS: Welcome
to Huntington Beach.


291
0:10:52,53 --> 0:10:56,66
DON SZABO: Back at the house,
I mean, he had crazy parties


292
0:10:56,66 --> 0:10:57,89
every week.


293
0:10:57,89 --> 0:11:2,54
And ran until 2:00 or 4:00 in
the morning, and just a lot of


294
0:11:2,54 --> 0:11:3,63
crazy stuff going on.


295
0:11:3,63 --> 0:11:6,36
And I can say, I was kind of
worried for him, going, what's


296
0:11:6,36 --> 0:11:6,99
he going to do?


297
0:11:6,99 --> 0:11:10,16
He's kind of, spending his
money, and not making money


298
0:11:10,16 --> 0:11:12,22
and just partying
and what-not.


299
0:11:12,22 --> 0:11:14,76
And little did I know that he
was going to turn that into


300
0:11:14,76 --> 0:11:15,34
his career.


301
0:11:15,34 --> 0:11:19,61
And he's doing really well,
throwing parties, and doing


302
0:11:19,61 --> 0:11:22,242
the whole monster stage
thing that he does.


303
0:11:22,242 --> 0:11:24,68
He's a super-creative guy,
and he's always been a


304
0:11:24,68 --> 0:11:25,83
really great guy.


305
0:11:25,83 --> 0:11:26,79
DAMIAN SANDERS: This
is the front porch


306
0:11:26,79 --> 0:11:28,0
that got so much action.


307
0:11:28,0 --> 0:11:29,63
We used to have our 4th
of July parties.


308
0:11:29,63 --> 0:11:32,49
Everybody would be hanging out
out here, partying all over.


309
0:11:32,49 --> 0:11:33,33
This was the 'hood.


310
0:11:33,33 --> 0:11:36,25
And then right there is the
beach, 100 yards away.


311
0:11:36,25 --> 0:11:38,46
Can't complain.


312
0:11:38,46 --> 0:11:41,215
When we first moved into this
house, the first party I ever


313
0:11:41,215 --> 0:11:43,38
had, I walked outside and
Dana was riding the


314
0:11:43,38 --> 0:11:44,63
oil rig, going "browrr".


315
0:11:44,63 --> 0:11:48,36



316
0:11:48,36 --> 0:11:50,79
You'll see later like the giant
human catapult we built


317
0:11:50,79 --> 0:11:54,7
in the backyard, here, that
my buddy got launched


318
0:11:54,7 --> 0:11:55,4
at the beach on.


319
0:11:55,4 --> 0:11:57,49
Dana's got it on one of his
videos, and the guy flies


320
0:11:57,49 --> 0:11:59,58
about 15 feet up, and then
cracks his head on the back of


321
0:11:59,58 --> 0:12:0,39
the catapult.


322
0:12:0,39 --> 0:12:2,23
STEVE GRAHAM: It was a
Halloween party at


323
0:12:2,23 --> 0:12:4,9
Damian's, and we--


324
0:12:4,9 --> 0:12:6,98
I mean, everyone was there.


325
0:12:6,98 --> 0:12:8,24
We were raging.


326
0:12:8,24 --> 0:12:11,54
The ladies who were strippers
ended up showing up a lot


327
0:12:11,54 --> 0:12:14,32
more, like more the LA crowd all
of a sudden showed up, for


328
0:12:14,32 --> 0:12:15,19
Damian's parties.


329
0:12:15,19 --> 0:12:17,85
The next thing you know, there's
girls making out, and


330
0:12:17,85 --> 0:12:20,0
windows being broken.


331
0:12:20,0 --> 0:12:22,8
It was out of hand, and we
couldn't have enough of it.


332
0:12:22,8 --> 0:12:26,7
And we were just all dressed
up in some stupid costume.


333
0:12:26,7 --> 0:12:27,79
And that was, I think,
the first--


334
0:12:27,79 --> 0:12:30,58
in my opinion-- the
first Club Rubber.


335
0:12:30,58 --> 0:12:31,66
DAMIAN SANDERS: I
knew that night.


336
0:12:31,66 --> 0:12:33,52
When that party was over, we
knew we were on to something


337
0:12:33,52 --> 0:12:36,7
huge, because everybody had
the time of their lives.


338
0:12:36,7 --> 0:12:37,38
TODD RICHARDS: I know
Damian used to do


339
0:12:37,38 --> 0:12:38,63
that Club Rubber thing.


340
0:12:38,63 --> 0:12:40,27
It was like a really big
moneymaker for him for a


341
0:12:40,27 --> 0:12:42,68
while, and probably
just rakes cash.


342
0:12:42,68 --> 0:12:45,54
Because people-- it's like
legendary at this point.


343
0:12:45,54 --> 0:12:47,7
So he's got a good
thing going.


344
0:12:47,7 --> 0:12:49,89
He's still marketing himself
as being a weirdo.


345
0:12:49,89 --> 0:12:51,234
It's awesome.


346
0:12:51,234 --> 0:12:52,8
I like it.


347
0:12:52,8 --> 0:12:53,99
DAMIAN SANDERS: The things that
used to go down at my


348
0:12:53,99 --> 0:12:55,67
house were phenomenal.


349
0:12:55,67 --> 0:12:57,67
And at Rubber, Ecstasy
was huge.


350
0:12:57,67 --> 0:13:0,84
Everybody was on drugs and
techno music had just come in.


351
0:13:0,84 --> 0:13:4,6
So you go to that club, and it
was almost like this great


352
0:13:4,6 --> 0:13:4,78
hedonism orgy.


353
0:13:4,78 --> 0:13:5,77
It was just nuts.


354
0:13:5,77 --> 0:13:8,1
And you go in there-- you open
a door into one of the VIP


355
0:13:8,1 --> 0:13:9,53
rooms, and people were
in there having sex.


356
0:13:9,53 --> 0:13:9,95
And you were like, oh, shit!


357
0:13:9,95 --> 0:13:10,26
Sorry!


358
0:13:10,26 --> 0:13:12,26
And you close the door and
go party somewhere else.


359
0:13:12,26 --> 0:13:14,23
And it was happening
every single night.


360
0:13:14,23 --> 0:13:15,78
And the cops didn't catch
on for literally


361
0:13:15,78 --> 0:13:16,97
four or five years.


362
0:13:16,97 --> 0:13:19,2
People were walking around with
hats that say "X Man" on


363
0:13:19,2 --> 0:13:21,66
it, because that's the dealer.


364
0:13:21,66 --> 0:13:24,165
The Huntington Beach team had
a great run for about six or


365
0:13:24,165 --> 0:13:24,5
eight years.


366
0:13:24,5 --> 0:13:25,99
There were just phenomenal.


367
0:13:25,99 --> 0:13:28,73
John Huntington, I met through
nightclubs down here, because


368
0:13:28,73 --> 0:13:29,98
I was doing all these
house parties.


369
0:13:29,98 --> 0:13:32,32
He was also doing nightclub
production stuff.


370
0:13:32,32 --> 0:13:35,1
We started going to Las Vegas,
started doing clubs out there.


371
0:13:35,1 --> 0:13:37,74
And from the clubs out there,
we went into arenas.


372
0:13:37,74 --> 0:13:39,37
And John was like the
booking agent.


373
0:13:39,37 --> 0:13:41,12
He would go into these massive
casinos and OK, we want to


374
0:13:41,12 --> 0:13:43,77
throw a Pimp 'N Ho party at
the casino, at, like, the


375
0:13:43,77 --> 0:13:44,89
Mandalay Bay.


376
0:13:44,89 --> 0:13:46,16
Somehow he talked him into it.


377
0:13:46,16 --> 0:13:47,56
Tommy Lee was our guest host.


378
0:13:47,56 --> 0:13:49,35
Minnie Me was one
of our hosts.


379
0:13:49,35 --> 0:13:50,14
You know, made a fortune.


380
0:13:50,14 --> 0:13:51,77
It was like one of those movies
where the drug lord is


381
0:13:51,77 --> 0:13:53,26
laying on the bed, playing
in the money and shit.


382
0:13:53,26 --> 0:13:54,7
It was just classic.


383
0:13:54,7 --> 0:13:56,67
And then you've got 10,000
people on the dance floor and


384
0:13:56,67 --> 0:13:58,62
all these huge DJs and
everybody dressed


385
0:13:58,62 --> 0:13:59,62
like pimps and ho's.


386
0:13:59,62 --> 0:14:0,405
Tons of fun.


387
0:14:0,405 --> 0:14:1,83
It really fell into place.


388
0:14:1,83 --> 0:14:4,15
From snowboarding, to doing
