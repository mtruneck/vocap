###0 COUPLE OF ANNOUNCEMENTS FOR YOU. THE FIRST
###3 ANNOUNCEMENT IS THAT MR. KERN IS GIVING HIS REVIEW
###8 SESSION TODAY IN 2013, SO FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO WANT TO
###11 GO TO THE REVIEW SESSION YOU ARE WELCOME TO DO SO.
###13 MR. KERN WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR YOU. SECOND IS THAT
###16 THERE IS A HANDOUT WHICH IS A PEANUT. MAKE SURE ALL
###19 OF YOU HAVE IT. WE WILL BE USING IN THE LECTURE. FOR
###22 THOSE OF YOU WHO WEREN'T HERE YOU WILL BE AT
###24 A DISADVANTAGE BECAUSE THE PEANUT MAY BE ON THE
###27 MIDTERM. SO, THOSE OF YOU WHO LOOK AT IT TODAY WILL
###30 HAVE A BIT OF AN ADVANTAGE. LAST TIME WHEN WE ENDED
###36 LECTURE I WAS TALKING TO YOU ABOUT THE ANGIOSPERM. WE
###42 SAID THAT THE ANGIOSPERMS TURNED OUT TO BE SUCCESSFUL
###47 
###51 ANGIOSPERMS. ABOUT 240 THOUSAND PLANTS ARE
###56 ANGIOSPERMS. THE REASON THEY TURNED OUT TO BE SUCH
###58 A SUCCESSFUL GROUP IS REALLY FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS.
###61 FIRST OF ALL THEY DEVELOPED THE FRUIT TO PROTECT THE
###66 DEVELOPING EMBRYO. AND WE TALKED ABOUT THE FLOWER
###72 WHICH IS A WAY OF ATTRACTING A POLLINATOR, AND IN FACT
###76 THAT TAKES US TO REALLY ITS PART OF THE SECOND AND
###80 THIRD REASON OR ONE IN THE SAME IS WHICH THEY DEVELOP
###83 A MECHANISM FOR FACILITATED POLLINATION OR FOR
###98 FACILITATING THE TRANSFER OF POLLEN. THESE ARE REALLY
###101 IMPORTANT CHARACTERISTICS THAT THE ANGIOSPERMS HAD AND
###104 THAT IS WHAT MAKES THEM THE DOMINANT PLANTS OF TODAY'S
###107 EARTH.
###109 TODAY, WHAT I WANT TO DO WITH TODAY'S LECTURE WE
###112 WILL BEGIN A SERIES OF TALKS OR LECTURES ON THE GROWTH
###116 AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE ANGIOSPERM PLANT BODY.
###119 WE WILL TALK ABOUT, NOT TODAY, BUT EVENTUALLY WE
###129 
###132 PHYSIOLOGY WHICH IS INVOLVED IN THE LIFE HISTORY OF
###136 THESE VERY INTERESTING ORGANISMS. NOW, IN ORDER FOR
###140 US TO STUDY AND UNDERSTAND BIOCHEMISTRY AND PHYSIOLOGY
###144 AND TO APPRECIATE IT, WE ALSO HAVE TO KNOW SOMETHING
###147 ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF THE PLANT. WHERE DO THESE
###149 EVENTS OCCUR AND WHAT ARE THE TISSUES AND CELL TYPES
###151 IN WHICH THE EVENTS OCCUR? WE WILL BE SPENDING TIME
###155 IN THE NEXT LECTURE TALKING ABOUT THE CELL AND TISSUE
###157 TYPES AS SORT OF AN OPENING FOR THE PHYSIOLOGY AND
###162 BIOCHEMICAL EXPERIMENTS I WILL TELL YOU ABOUT.
###166 WHENEVER WE TALK ABOUT GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT IN
###168 PLANTS ONE OF THE POINTS WHICH UNDERLIES THE
###171 DISCUSSION, AND YOU SHOULD KEEP THIS IN YOUR MIND THAT
###173 ONCE THE PLANT SENDS DOWN ITS ROOTS AND IT PUTS ITSELF
###178 IN A PARTICULAR SPOT IT IS THERE FOR THE REST OF ITS
###181 LIFE. IF THE WEATHER TURNS BAD OR WATER RUNS LOW OR
###184 IF A TREE GROWS OVER IT THAT PLANT CAN'T GET UP AND
###188 
###190 CONDITIONS. IT CAN'T MOVE LIKE AN ANIMAL MOVES. SO
###194 PLANTS HAVE DEVELOPED MECHANISMS AND WE WILL TALK
###196 ABOUT MANY OF THEM TO HELP THEM SENSE CHANGES IN THEIR
###199 ENVIRONMENT AND RESPOND TO CHANGES IN THEIR
###202 ENVIRONMENT. THIS IS REALLY GOING TO BE A THEME IN
###204 ONE OF OUR TALKS IS HOW DO PLANTS SENSE CHANGES AND
###207 HOW DO THEY RESPOND. REALIZE THAT A PLANT IS
###210 EVENTUALLY FIXED OR ROOTED OR TRAPPED WHEREVER IT
###213 HAPPENS TO PUT DOWN ITS ROOTS. LAST TIME WE ENDED THE
###218 DISCUSSION BY INTRODUCING YOU TO FERTILIZATION IN THE
###222 PLANT AND WE SAID FERTILIZATION IN ANGIOSPERM RESULTED
###226 IN TWO EVENTS. WE HAVE DOUBLE FERTILIZATION, AND AS
###235 A RESULT OF DOUBLE FERTILIZATION TWO DIFFERENT TYPES
###238 OF EVENTS OCCURRED. FIRST OF ALL, WE HAD THE
###241 BEGINNING OF THE 2N EMBRYO. THEN, SECONDLY, WE HAVE
###248 THIS 3N OR TRIPLOID TISSUE WHICH I CALLED ENDOSPERM.
###255 WE WILL SPEND SOME TIME NOW TALKING ABOUT BOTH
###262 
###264 FERTILIZATION AND RETURN TO ENDOSPERM IN A MOMENT.
###270 LET'S FIRST LOOK AT THE DEVELOPING EMBRYO AND THEN WE
###273 WILL LOOK AT THE ENDOSPERM.
###277 IN ANGIOSPERMS WHAT WAS NOTICED WHEN PEOPLE
###280 STARTED STUDYING THEM VERY CAREFULLY IS THAT EMBRYO'S
###284 TENDED TO FALL IN ONE OF TWO GROUPS.
###287 IF YOU LOOKED AT THE MATURE EMBRYO I WILL DO
###289 A CARTOON HERE, I WILL POINT OUT THE PARTS THAT ARE
###293 IMPORTANT. IN ONE TYPE OF EMBRYO, THERE SEEMED TO BE
###298 TWO BUMPS.
###304 AND THESE TWO BUMPS, BECAUSE THEY WERE
###307 PRESENT IN THE EMBRYO, THEY ARE CALLED SEED LEAVES,
###311 BECAUSE THEY ARE PRESENT IN THE SEED. SEED LEAVES.
###315 OR THE TECHNICAL TERM THEY ARE CALLED COTYLEDONS. AND
###322 BECAUSE THEY HAVE TWO BUMPS OR TWO SEED LEAVES THEY
###326 ARE CALLED DICOTS. TWO COTYLEDONS, OR TWO LEAVES AND
###333 THE MORE CURRENT TERM NOW, RATHER THAN CALLING THEM
###336 DICOTS, YOUR BOOK REFERS TO THEM AS EUDICOTS. BUT,
###340 
###342 DICOTS. ONE TYPE OF EMBRYO THAT WE FIND WHEN WE STUDY
###347 THE MATURE SEEDS OF ANGIOSPERMS. THE SECOND TYPE OF
###352 EMBRYO WHICH WE FIND HAS, AS IT TURNS OUT, ONE BUMP OR
###365 ONE COTYLEDON. AND PLANTS HAVING THIS TYPE OF EMBRYO
###370 ARE KNOWN AS MONOCOTS. MONO MEANING ONE. IN THE
###378 ANGIOSPERMS YOU CAN DIVIDE THE GROUP OF PLANTS, 240
###383 THOUSAND SPECIES, INTO ONE OF TWO SORT OF SUBGROUPS,
###387 BASED UPON WHAT THE EMBRYO LOOKS LIKE. NOW, WHAT I
###392 WANT TO SAY IS THAT IN SOME PLANTS, THESE ARE
###399 USUALLY EUDICOTS. USUALLY EUDICOTS, BUT NOT ALWAYS.
###410 THE EMBRYO ENLARGES AND ITS COTYLEDONS EVENTUALLY FILL
###423 THE SEED.
###426 FILL THE SEED. SO, IF YOU COULD IMAGINE SEED
###431 WHICH IS DEVELOPING WHICH HAD ENDOSPERM HERE, AND
###438 A SMALL EMBRYO HERE. YOU WAITED FOR SOME TIME IN THIS
###445 EXAMPLE THAT I HAVE GIVEN YOU, WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE IS
###448 MOST OF THE SEED WOULD BE FILLED WITH THE EMBRYO.
###450 
###456 THIS TENDS TO OCCUR IN THE EUDICOTS. IN THE MONOCOTS,
###463 IN GENERAL, THE EMBRYO REMAINS SMALL IN THE MONOCOTS.
###477 MOST OF THE SEED IS FILLED WITH ENDOSPERM.
###491 BUT WHAT I WANT TO SAY NOW, AND WE WILL EXPLORE
###493 THIS STATEMENT IN A FEW MINUTES, THAT BOTH COTYLEDONS
###503 AND ENDOSPERM PROVIDE NUTRIENTS FOR THE DEVELOPING
###516 SEEDLING. WE WILL EXPLORE THIS STATEMENT A LITTLE
###519 MORE VERY SHORTLY.
###527 NOW, LET'S LOOK AT THE EMBRYO AXIS WITH THE
###531 COTYLEDONS ATTACHED. AGAIN, WE HAVE TWO TYPES OF
###535 AXIS. IN THE FIRST TYPE, WE HAVE THE EUDICOT WITH THE
###540 TWO COTYLEDONS. THIS IS THE EMBRYO AXIS.
###551 HERE IS THE EUDICOT. TWO COTYLEDON ATTACHED.
###559 WE TEND TO GIVE THE NAME TO THE REGION ABOVE THE
###562 COTYLEDONS AND THE REGION BELOW. AND THE REASON I
###564 WANT TO GIVE YOU THIS TERMINOLOGY IS, YOU WILL SEE IT
###567 IN THE LAB AND IT WILL BE IMPORTANT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT
###570 
###573 COTYLEDONS IS CALLED EPI, FOR BEING ABOVE, THE
###580 EPICOTYL, EPICOTYL. THE REGION ABOVE WHERE THE
###585 COTYLEDONS ARE ATTACHED TO THE AXIS. AND THE REGION
###588 BELOW, HYPO, MEANING BELOW COTYL. THE REGION BELOW THE
###594 AXIS. IF WE LOOK AT A MONOCOT, WHICH HAS ONLY ONE
###599 COTYLEDON, WE WOULD HAVE THE SINGLE COTYLEDON AND WE
###604 WOULD HAVE EXACTLY THOSE SAME REGIONS, THE EPI AND THE
###609 HYPO. NOW, THIS NEXT COUPLE OF MINUTES, WHAT I AM
###615 GOING TO TELL YOU, IS PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT
###617 POINT OR THE HARDEST POINT OF TODAY'S LECTURE, BECAUSE
###620 WE WILL BE REFERRING BACK TO IT AS WE GO FURTHER INTO
###622 THE CLASS. I WILL WRITE THIS DOWN FOR YOU. AT EITHER
###629 OF END OF THE AXIS ARE ZONES OF HIGH CELL DIVISION
###641 ACTIVITY.
###647 WE CALL THESE ZONES OF HIGH CELL DIVISION
###650 ACTIVITY, MERISTEMS.
###655 SO, AT THIS END HERE WE HAVE A MERISTEM, BECAUSE
###663 IT IS AT THE TOP, IT IS THE SHOOT MERISTEM.
###675 BECAUSE IT IS AT THE BOTTOM, WE CALL IT THE ROOT
###678 MERISTEM.
###680 NOW, WHY ARE THESE ZONES SO IMPORTANT?
###686 THROUGH THEIR ACTIVITY,
###695 NEW CELLS ARE PRODUCED
###696 IN THE AXIS.
###702 ARE PRODUCED.
###705 NEW CELLS PRODUCED. SO WE HAVE THESE ZONES OF
###708 HIGH CELL DIVISION ACTIVITY. THE SHOOT MERISTEM AND
###711 THE ROOT MERISTEM. THEY DIVIDE AND WHAT I AM SAYING
###714 IS THROUGH THOSE DIVISION ACTIVITIES WE PRODUCE MANY
###718 NEW CELLS.
###721 IF A CELL OR TISSUE, THIS IS THE HARD PART.
###727 CELL OR TISSUE CAN BE TRACED BACK IN ITS ORIGIN, TO
###741 THE MERISTEM, THAT IS, IF A CELL OR TISSUE ORIGINATED
###747 AT A MERISTEM WE CALL THIS CELL OR TISSUE, PRIMARY.
###758 CALL IT PRIMARY. WE HAVE THE FIRST CATEGORY OF CELL
###763 TYPES I WANT TO INTRODUCE YOU TO OR TISSUE TYPES,
###765 WHICH WE CALL PRIMARY. WE CALL THEM PRIMARY, BECAUSE
###769 
###773 MEITOTIC ACTIVITY AT EITHER THE ROOT MERISTEM OR SHOOT
###776 MERISTEM. THIS IS IMPORTANT POINT AND I WANT YOU TO
###779 MAKE SURE YOU ALL UNDERSTAND THIS. OKAY, NOW, WHAT I
###785 WANT TO DO IS TO EXPLORE THE SECOND TISSUE, WHICH WAS
###790 IN THE EMBRYO, NAMELY THE ENDOSPERM.
###797 WE SAID THE ENDOSPERM IS 3N OR TRIPLOID. ALL OF
###801 YOU, MAYBE THERE IS A RARE EXCEPTION HERE IN THIS
###804 ROOM, BUT ALL OF YOU HAVE INTIMATE EXPERIENCE IN YOUR
###807 LIVES WITH ENDOSPERM. WHENEVER YOU EAT CORN AND YOU
###813 BITE INTO A EAR OF CORN WHICH MAY COME FROM, NOT FROM
###817 SAFEWAY, BUT MIGHT COME FROM, LET'S SAY ANDRONICO'S OR
###819 BERKELEY BOWL OR MONTEREY MARKET. WHEN YOU BITE INTO
###822 A CORN KERNEL AND YOU HAVE LIQUID WHICH SQUIRTS ON TO
###826 YOUR FACE WHEN YOU BITE INTO A CORN KERNEL, THAT
###829 LIQUID, WHICH IS SQUIRTING ON TO YOUR FACE, IS LIQUID
###831 ENDOSPERM. THAT MATERIAL IS NUTRIENT MATERIAL THAT WE
###836 LIKE WHICH IS SWEET AND PROVIDES THE NUTRITION FOR THE
###840 
###843 IS PRODUCED ON THE CORN PLANT AND IT IS FIRST
###847 PRODUCED, THE LIQUID ENDOSPERM IS SWEET. LET'S ASSUME
###851 THIS EAR FALLS TO THE GROUND AND FOR SOME REASON IT
###853 WASN'T HARVESTED JUST LAID ON THE GROUND. WHAT
###856 NORMALLY HAPPENS IN NATURE IS THIS EAR FALLS TO THE
###859 GROUND, IF IT IS NOT PICKED OR EATEN BY AN ANIMAL, THE
###862 LIQUID ENDOSPERM TURNS TO STARCH. THIS IS WHAT
###865 HAPPENS IN SAFEWAY WHEN THEY LET IT SIT ON THE SHELF
###868 WITHOUT BEING REFRIGERATED. THE LIQUID ENDOSPERM
###871 TURNS TO STARCH AND LOSES SWEETNESS. IN NATURE, THE
###875 EAR REMAINS ON THE GROUND IN A STATE OF STARCHINESS
###878 THROUGHOUT THE WINTER, AND THEN WHEN SPRING COMES THAT
###882 STARCH IS CONVERTED BACK TO SUGAR AGAIN. AND IS USED
###885 BY THE DEVELOPING SEEDLING. MY QUESTION TO YOU,
###888 ANOTHER QUESTION WHICH I WANT TO ADDRESS IS WHY GO
###891 THROUGH THE PROCESS OF SUGAR TO STARCH TO SUGAR WHICH
###896 IS A BIO-CHEMICALLY, VERY EXPENSIVE PROCESS WHERE IT
###898 
###901 WITH SUGAR AND ENDING WITH SUGAR. WHY GO THROUGH THIS
###904 MIDDLE PHASE OF STARCH. QUESTION THAT I WOULD LIKE
###906 YOU TO THINK ABOUT. ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF LIQUID
###910 ENDOSPERM THAT MANY OF YOU ESPECIALLY THOSE OF YOU
###912 FROM EAST ASIAN CULTURES ARE FAMILIAR WITH IS COCONUT
###915 MILK. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN HEAR. THIS IS COCONUT
###920 MILK YOU CAN BUY IN THE STORE. COCONUT MILK IS LIQUID
###924 ENDOSPERM. THIS IS MATERIAL WHICH THE COCONUT PLANT
###929 DEVELOPS AND PUTS ASIDE FOR THE NOURISHMENT OF THE
###934 YOUNG COCONUT SEEDLING, UNTIL IT GETS ESTABLISHED AND
###937 CAN PHOTOSYNTHESIZE. IT IS A VERY RICH COMPOUND, VERY
###941 RICH IN COMPOUNDS AND NEVER HAS BEEN FULLY ANALYZED
###944 BUT AS YOU MIGHT GUESS IT CONTAINS EVERYTHING,
###947 INCLUDING AMINO ACIDS THAT THE YOUNG SEEDLING NEEDS TO
###951 GET GOING. SO, IF WE TOOK A YOUNG COCONUT, WHICH I
###953 HAVE SOME EXAMPLES HERE, IF I MADE A CUT DOWN THE
###957 MIDDLE OF THE COCONUT WHAT WE WOULD SEE IS THE
###959 
###965 AT ONE END OF THE COCONUT IS THE EMBRYO. ONE END OF
###970 THE COCONUT IS THE EMBRYO. THE REST OF THE COCONUT IS
###974 THE ENDOSPERM. IT IS LIQUID ENDOSPERM. NOW AS THIS
###981 EMBRYO MATURES AND STARTING TO GROW, WHAT YOU FIND
###987 HAPPENING AND WHAT MOST OF YOU ARE EXPERIENCED WITH IS
###991 THAT THERE IS WHITE TISSUE, WHICH IS WHAT YOU EAT WHEN
###996 YOU HAVE COCONUT. THIS WHITE TISSUE ALONG THE OUTSIDE
###1002 OR THE PERIMETER OF THE COCONUT. THIS WHITE TISSUE IS
###1007 CELLULARIZED ENDOSPERM. THAT IS, EACH OF THESE 3N
###1016 NUCLEI, OF WHICH THERE ARE MILLIONS, MILLIONS OF THEM,
###1020 HAVE NOW BEGUN TO PARTITION INTO INDIVIDUAL CELLS SO
###1026 THAT IF YOU CUT THROUGH A MATURE COCONUT WHICH IS JUST
###1030 STARTING TO GERMINATE THERE WOULD NO LONGER BE LIQUID
###1034 ALL OF THE ENDOSPERM WOULD BE CELLULARIZED. I HAVE
###1037 HERE A COCONUT WHICH HAS BEEN CUT DOWN THE MIDDLE,
###1042 THIS COCONUT HAS BEEN CUT DOWN THE MIDDLE WE JUST
###1044 DON'T HAVE THE COCONUT, WE HAVE THE FRUIT. YOU ARE
###1048 
###1053 THE OTHER PART OF THE FRUIT WALL, WHICH WE HAVE OVER
###1055 HERE. THIS FRUIT WALL HAS A SPECIAL PURPOSE, BUT FOR
###1060 OUR TALK RIGHT NOW IT PROTECTS THE EMBRYO. IF WE OPEN
###1063 THE SPECIAL COCONUT UP, LIKE SO, YOU CAN SEE THE
###1067 FIBROUS NATURE OF THE FRUIT WALL AND HERE YOU CAN SEE
###1070 THE ENDOSPERM, WHICH I HAVE TAKEN OUT OVER HERE AND
###1073 PART OF THE SEED COAT IS THIS BROWN MATERIAL ON THE
###1076 OUTSIDE. NOW, AT ONE END OF THE COCONUT WOULD HAVE
###1079 BEEN THE EMBRYO, AND IF YOU LOOK AT COCONUTS, I HOPE
###1084 THAT YOU WILL NEVER LOOK AT THEM THE SAME WAY WHEN YOU
###1085 GO TO THE STORE, IF YOU LOOK AT A COCONUT, THERE ARE
###1089 STRUCTURES ON THE BOTTOM, WHICH ARE KNOWN COLLOQUIALLY
###1091 AS EYES. IF YOU LOOK CAREFULLY AT THESE EYES, YOU
###1094 WILL SEE ONE OF THEM IS BIGGER, BIGGER QUADRANT, WHICH
###1098 OCCUPIES THE COCONUT. THIS COCONUT ORIGINALLY HAD 3
###1103 EMBRYOS THAT WERE FERTILIZED. IT DECIDES AS SOME
###1107 POINT IN ITS DEVELOPMENT WHEN ALL OF THE EMBRYOS ARE
###1110 
###1115 OF THOSE EMBRYOS. THAT EMBRYO IS FOUND UNDER THE
###1118 LARGER QUADRANT, LARGEST QUADRANT. WHAT WE ARE GOING
###1120 TO DO NOW, IS WE ARE GOING TO OPEN THIS COCONUT UP AND
###1124 AS I TOLD SOME OF YOU WHOSE LAB I VISITED YESTERDAY,
###1129 IF YOU SIT IN THE FRONT ROW MAKE SURE YOU BRING
###1131 UMBRELLA OR WEAR YOUR RAINCOAT. SO, ARE WE ALL SET
###1135 HERE. YOU GUYS ALL SET?
###1137 ALL RIGHT. WELL ACTUALLY, I ALREADY HAVE ONE
###1143 CRACKED. LET ME SHOW YOU THIS NOW.
###1148 PEOPLE THAT SAID, WE ARE NOT SITTING IN THE
###1154 FRONT HERE. HERE IS A COCONUT THAT I CRACKED AND
###1158 OPENED UP. IF YOU LOOK CAREFULLY AT THIS COCONUT,
###1161 AGAIN WE HAVE THIS FIBROUS MATERIAL AROUND THE
###1164 OUTSIDE, WHICH IS PART FRUIT WALL AND PART SEED COAT
###1166 WHICH HAVE JOINED TOGETHER. IF WE OPEN IT UP, I HAVE
###1169 TAKEN THE LIQUID ENDOSPERM OUT YOU CAN SEE SOME OF THE
###1172 CELLULARIZED ENDOSPERM, THE WHITE TISSUE WHICH WE EAT
###1175 
###1178 REASONS I MENTIONED BEFORE. THE EYES WOULD HAVE BEEN
###1181 AT THIS END OVER HERE AND I WILL SHOW YOU A PICTURE OF
###1184 THIS IN A MOMENT, BUT IF YOU WANT TO COME UP AFTER THE
###1189 END OF THE LECTURE YOU CAN SEE ONE OF THE COCONUT
###1192 EMBRYOS, THE COCONUT EMBRYO THAT I TOOK OUT FROM THIS
###1194 COCONUT WHEN I OPENED IT UP. IF YOU ARE EVER AT
###1196 A BORING PARTY AND THEY ARE SERVING COCONUTS AND YOU
###1199 WANT TO BECOME THE CENTER, GET A HAMMER AND DISSECT
###1203 OUT THE EMBRYO. AND I PROMISE YOU, NO ONE THE LOOK AT
###1206 YOU THE SAME WAY. I AM NOT SURE HOW THEY WILL LOOK AT
###1209 YOU.
###1210 ALL RIGHT LET'S TALK ABOUT THE OTHER FORM OF
###1218 MATERIAL, WHICH IS STORED INSIDE THE COCONUT BEFORE I
###1220 SHOW YOU SOME SLIDES. THAT OTHER FORM OF MATERIAL IS
###1224 STORED IN THE COTYLEDON OF THE EUDICOT. MOST OF YOU
###1228 ARE USING MATERIALS OF THE EUDICOT EVERY DAY,
###1232 MATERIALS THAT ARE STORED IN THE COTYLEDONS. WHEN WE
###1235 
###1239 ARE ESSENTIALLY GAINING YOUR NUTRITION FROM MATERIALS
###1242 THAT ARE STORED IN THE COTYLEDONS, IN THE SEED LEAVES.
###1245 THOSE MATERIALS WOULD NORMALLY BE USED FOR
###1248 ESTABLISHING THE SEEDLING. SO, WHEN YOU OPEN UP
###1250 A WALNUT AND TAKE OUT WHAT THIS CRINKLED STRUCTURE IS
###1254 HERE YOU ARE ACTUALLY LOOKING AT A COTYLEDON, AND THAT
###1258 COTYLEDON IS FULL OF OILS AND STARCHES AND SUGARS AND
###1262 IT SERVES THE FUNCTION OF PROVIDING NUTRITION TO THE
###1266 DEVELOPING EMBRYO. NOW I HAVE GIVEN OR ASKED YOU ALL
###1269 TAKE OUT A PEANUT. I WOULD LIKE YOU TO TAKE OUT THAT
###1271 PEANUT NOW. BUT DON'T OPEN IT YET. WHEN YOU DO OPEN
###1274 IT, IF YOU CAN PUT YOUR SHELLS, GIVEN THE CUT IN THE
###1278 BUDGET, THE SHELL WILL PROBABLY BE ON THE FLOOR NEXT
###1280 YEAR, PUT IT IN YOUR POCKET DON'T THROW IT ON THE
###1283 FLOOR. LOOK AT THE OUTSIDE OF THE SHELL. WHAT IS
###1287 THIS MATERIAL ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE MATERIAL? I SAID
###1290 THE SEEDS ARE ON THE INSIDE. WHAT WOULD IT BE, MAKE
###1292 
###1299 WHAT IS IT? IT IS THE FRUIT WALL. OKAY. SO
###1302 IN THIS CASE THINK OF THE APPLE. THE FRUIT WAS SOFT
###1305 AND SWEET, BUT THE EMBRYO WAS STILL PROTECTED. IN
###1308 THIS EXAMPLE, THE FRUIT WALL HAS BECOME HARD, YET IT
###1313 IS STILL PROTECTS THE DEVELOPING EMBRYO ON THE INSIDE.
###1315 IT IS NOT SOFT. IT IS NOT MEANT TO BE EATEN BY
###1318 SOME ANIMAL FOR DISPERSAL. NOW I WOULD LIKE YOU TO DO
###1320 IS OPEN THE PEANUT UP AND WHAT YOU WILL NOTICE, THE
###1323 FIRST THING WHEN YOU ENCOUNTER, WHAT ARE THE PEANUTS
###1326 THEY ARE SURROUNDED BY A BROWN PAPERY COATING. WHAT
###1331 IS THAT BROWN PAPERY COATING? ANYBODY KNOW WHAT THE
###1335 BROWN PAPERY COATING IS? YOU SAID IT BEFORE. IT IS
###1338 THE SEED COAT. CORRECT. NOW, WHAT I WOULD LIKE YOU
###1341 TO DO IS TAKE ONE OF THE PEANUTS AND CAREFULLY SPLIT
###1344 IT IN HALF. WHAT YOU ARE SPLITTING IN HALF YOU WIND
###1349 UP WITH TWO, LOOKS LIKE TORPEDO-SHAPED HALVES. EACH OF
###1353 THOSE IS A COTYLEDON. AND AT THE BASE OF ONE OF THEM
###1357 
###1361 THIS PARTICULAR CASE THE COTYLEDONS HAVE EXPANDED TO
###1365 FILL THE SEED AND TO ABSORB ALL OF THE ENDOSPERM AND
###1369 THEY PROVIDE THE NUTRITION FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE
###1374 YOUNG EMBRYO AXIS. LET'S LOOK AT A FEW PICTURES OF
###1378 THE COCONUT.
###1386 OKAY, FIRST SLIDE IS OF A COCONUT HERE YOU CAN
###1392 SEE THE 3 DIFFERENT EYES OF THE COCONUT. THIS THE
###1396 LARGEST EYE. IT OCCUPIES THE LARGEST QUADRANT. UNDER
###1398 THIS EYE IS THE DEVELOPING EMBRYO. EMBRYOS WHICH ARE
###1402 PRESENT UNDER THESE TWO EYES HAVE ABORTED. NOW, IF WE
###1406 TAKE THE HAMMER AND WE CRACK IT AND THE BEST PLACE TO
###1409 HIT IT IS RIGHT WHERE THE 3 SUTURES, THE 3 ENDS MEET.
###1413 WE TAKE THE HAMMER WE CRACK IT AND WE CAN GET OUT THE
###1415 EMBRYO. THIS IS A CENTIMETER SCALE HERE. AND HERE YOU
###1419 CAN SEE THE EMBRYO. THIS WOULD BE THE SHOOT END AND
###1422 AT THIS END OVER HERE WOULD BE WHERE THE COTYLEDON IS
###1424 LOCATED. IF WE LET THAT COTYLEDON ENLARGE, AS YOU
###1427 
###1430 LOCATED HERE AND AS IT ENLARGED ITS COTYLEDON WOULD
###1433 GROW INTO THE LIQUID ENDOSPERM AND GRADUALLY ABSORB
###1437 THE MATERIALS, WHICH WOULD THEN BE USED TO HELP THIS
###1440 COCONUT BECOME ESTABLISHED, AS FAR AS ITS DEVELOPMENT
###1443 IS CONCERNED. THIS IS THE COCONUT AND I ENCOURAGE YOU
###1448 TO SPEND TIME EITHER LOOKING AT THE EMBRYO HERE OR WE
###1452 WILL PUT THE COCONUT IN THE CLASSROOM, HAVE A LOOK AT
###1454 IT OR WHEN YOU NEXT GO TO THE SUPERMARKET YOU MAY TAKE
###1457 A LOOK AT IT. WE SAID THAT ANGIOSPERM'S WERE
###1464 SUCCESSFUL BECAUSE THEY DEVELOPED THIS FACILITATED
###1466 POLLINATION AND DEVELOPED THE FRUIT OR AS YOU SAW THE
###1469 FRUIT WALL, OR IN THIS CASE, IT BECAME HARD.
###1472 THERE WAS ANOTHER REASON WHY THEY WERE
###1473 SUCCESSFUL, AND I WANT TO TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT THAT
###1476 OTHER REASON BECAUSE IT IS IMPORTANT AND THERE ARE
###1478 ALSO SOME INTERESTING STORIES ASSOCIATED WITH IT.
###1480 THEY WERE SUCCESSFUL, IN ADDITION TO THE FIRST TWO
###1483 
###1487 DEVELOPED MEANS OR DIFFERENT MECHANISMS FOR SEED AND
###1493 FRUIT DISPERSAL. SO, MECHANISMS FOR SEED AND FRUIT
###1503 DISPERSAL.
###1508 THESE ARE ONE OF THE ADDITIONAL REASONS WHY THE
###1511 ANGIOSPERMS HAVE BECOME SO SUCCESSFUL. SOME OF THESE
###1513 MEANS ARE PASSIVE. I MEAN PASSIVE IS THAT THERE IS NO
###1518 OTHER ORGANISM INVOLVED.
###1526 YOU ARE ALL FAMILIAR WITH SOME OF THESE PASSIVE
###1529 MEANS. FOR EXAMPLE, DANDELIONS, IF YOU EVER LOOK AT A
###1532 DANDELION IT MAKES A PARACHUTE-LIKE DEVICE, WHICH
###1536 ALLOWS THE SEED OR THE FRUIT TO BE PICKED UP BY THE
###1539 WIND. WIND IS A BIG DISPERSER OF SEEDS, ESPECIALLY
###1543 SEEDS THAT ARE SMALL AND LIGHT. FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO
###1546 MIGHT COME FROM THE MIDWEST OR SOUTHWEST WHERE YOU
###1549 HAVE EVER SEEN TUMBLE WEEDS BLOWING ACROSS THE
###1555 HIGHWAY. A TUMBLE WEED IS A PLANT WHICH HAS A
###1559 CONNECTION TO ITS ROOT SYSTEM AND AT SOME POINT WHEN
###1561 
###1564 SYSTEM ARE SEVERED FROM EACH OTHER AND THE SHOOT
###1567 SYSTEM BECOMES MOBILE. SO, WHEN IT IS WINDY, THE
###1571 WHOLE PLANT TUMBLES AND AS IT TUMBLES IT DISPERSES
###1575 SEEDS THROUGHOUT ITS ENVIRONMENT AND CAN TRAVEL AND
###1579 DISPERSE SEEDS OVER GREAT DISTANCES.
###1582 ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF PASSIVE MEANS OF SEED AND
###1585 FRUIT DISPERSAL IS SHOWN HERE BY THIS COCONUT PLANT.
###1591 HERE IS A PLANT, WHICH IS DISPERSED BY WATER. THIS
###1597 HARD, FIBROUS FRUIT WALL ON THE OUTSIDE MAKES THE SEED
###1602 BUOYANT AND ALSO MAKES IT RESISTANT TO SALT WATER AND
###1605 ALLOWS THE WATER TO TRANSPORT COCONUTS OVER GREAT
###1609 DISTANCES AND ALLOWS THE PLANTS TO BECOME ESTABLISHED,
###1612 ON, AS YOU KNOW PICTURES OF TROPICAL ISLANDS, VERY
###1615 DISTANT FROM WHERE THE ORIGINAL COCONUT STARTED. THIS
###1619 DISPERSAL BY WATER IS ALSO USED BY A LOT OF OTHER
###1622 PLANTS ON THE LAND. FOR EXAMPLE, YOU CAN IMAGINE
###1624 STREAMS OR RAIN WATER DISPERSING LARGE AMOUNTS OF SEED
###1629 
###1632 ARE MORE ACTIVE MEANS OF DISPERSAL.
###1640 IT IS ACTIVE IS SORT OF A -- NOT QUITE THE WORD,
###1643 BUT I CAN'T THINK OF A BETTER ONE. ALL OF YOU ARE
###1645 FAMILIAR WITH THIS MEANS, WHICH IS ACTIVE, AND I
###1648 SUSPECT ALL OF YOU HAVE UNWITTINGLY DONE THIS. WHEN
###1651 YOU WALK THROUGH A WEEDY AREA OR FOREST AND LOOK AT
###1656 THE CUFFS OF YOUR PANTS OR SOCKS YOU HAVE THINGS STUCK
###1659 ON TO THEM. THOSE THINGS ARE EITHER SEEDS OR FRUITS
###1664 WHICH HAVE HAD THEIR OUTER WALLS MODIFIED WITH HOOKS
###1667 TO STICK ON TO YOUR CLOTHES. THIS WAS SUCH AN
###1671 INTERESTING TOPIC TO A FELLOW AS TO HOW THESE SEEDS
###1675 STUCK ON TO HIS CLOTHES HE LOOKED AT THEM UNDER THE
###1678 MICROSCOPE AND HE FOUND THAT HE COULD REPEATEDLY TAKE
###1681 THE SEED ON AND OFF, ON AND OFF, AND THE HOOK WAS NOT
###1683 DAMAGED. THIS IS THE BASIS OF THE DISCOVERY OF
###1686 VELCRO. THIS IS HOW VELCRO WAS DISCOVERED, BY TRYING
###1689 TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS PARTICULAR SEED OR FRUIT COULD
###1693 
###1697 THAT IS A MEANS OF ACTIVE DISPERSAL. ANOTHER MEANS OF
###1701 ACTIVE DISPERSAL IS ILLUSTRATED BY THE APPLE, WHICH WE
###1704 TALKED ABOUT LAST TIME. THE APPLE IS A SWEET FRUIT.
###1708 IT HAS AN ODOR TO IT. ANIMALS WANT TO EAT THE FRUIT.
###1712 MANY PLANTS MAKE FRUITS THAT HAVE A GOOD TASTE HOPING
###1715 THAT AN ANIMAL WILL EAT THEM AND DISPERSE THE FRUIT TO
###1719 AN AREA WHERE THERE IS NONE OF THE PLANT GROWING.
###1723 NOW, IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE, WHEN THE ANIMAL EAT THE
###1726 FRUIT, THE SEEDS GO INTO THE ANIMAL'S STOMACH AND THE
###1729 ANIMAL HAS STOMACH ACID AND CAN'T DIGEST THE SEEDS,
###1734 SEEDS AND THE ORGANISM, WHICH DISPERSE THEM, BUT
###1737 MOSTLY THE PLANTS. HAVE HAD TO DEVELOP KIND OF AN
###1740 UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT KIND OF ANIMAL WILL DISPERSE
###1742 THEM. HOW LONG IS THE SEED GOING TO REMAIN IN THE
###1745 ANIMALS STOMACH. HOW THICK SHOULD THE SEED COAT BE SO
###1748 THAT THE SEED IS NOT TOTALLY DIGESTED BY THE TIME THE
###1751 ANIMAL DEFECATES. SO, WHAT YOU FIND IS THAT SOMETIMES
###1756 
###1758 EATS THE FRUIT, THE SEED NEVER GETS OUT. IT IS
###1760 DIGESTED. THE RIGHT KIND OF ANIMAL IN AN AREA WHICH
###1762 EATS THE FRUIT WILL PASS THE SEED THROUGH ITS BODY.
###1769 BUT NOT ONLY IS THE SEED COAT DIGESTED JUST TO THE
###1772 POINT WHERE THE SEED IS STILL ALIVE BUT MANY PLANT
###1775 DEPENDS ON THE ANIMALS TO DIGEST THE SEED COATS TO
###1777 WEAKEN THEM. SO, THAT BY THE TIME THE ANIMAL
###1781 DEFECATES AND THE SEED IS RELEASED TO THE OUTSIDE THE
###1783 SEED COAT IS WEAKENED TO THE STATE WHERE THE SEED CAN
###1786 GERMINATE RIGHT AWAY. SO, THERE IS THIS PARTICULAR
###1790 RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SEED AND THE ANIMAL THAT
###1794 DISPERSES IT AND SOMETIMES IF THAT ANIMAL DISAPPEARS
###1799 THE SEED DISPERSAL WILL NOT OCCUR AT ALL OR NOT IN
###1802 A VERY PRODUCTIVE WAY. FINALLY, THE LAST WAY I WANT
###1806 TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT FACILITATED SEED AND FRUIT
###1809 DISPERSION BY ANIMALS OCCURS WITH INSECTS.
###1817 INSECT I WANT TO TALK TO YOU MOSTLY ARE ANTS.
###1824 ATTRACTIVE TO ANTS, HERE WE HAVE THE SEED. THESE
###1831 PLANTS, WHICH PRODUCE THESE SEEDS THAT ARE DISPERSED
###1835 BY ANTS ALSO PRODUCE A NEW TISSUE.
###1841 WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE NAME. A NEW
###1843 TISSUE WHICH IS OFTEN BUT NOT ALWAYS WHITE. WHITE IS
###1847 ATTRACTIVE TO ANTS. OFTEN BUT NOT ALWAYS WHITE. AND
###1851 THIS NEW TISSUE, THE ANTS FIND THEY CAN'T RESIST IT.
###1857 WHAT THEY DO IS, THEY GO OUT, THE ANTS GO OUT AND THEY
###1860 HARVEST SEEDS WHICH HAVE PRODUCED THIS NEW TISSUE,
###1864 WHITE TISSUE, AND THEY CARRY THE SEEDS BACK TO THEIR
###1866 BURROWS OR WHEREVER THEY HAPPEN TO BE LIVING. THERE
###1870 IN THE BURROW, THEY CONSUME THE WHITE TISSUE AND GET
###1874 THEIR REWARD FOR HAVING COLLECTED IT AND THEN THEY
###1876 ABANDON THE SEED. AND, HERE WE NOW HAVE ESSENTIALLY
###1879 SEEDS PLANTED IN THE GROUND BY THE ANTS AND DEPENDING
###1883 ON HOW DEEP THE SEED IS IN THE GROUND AND DEPENDING
###1885 UPON WHETHER THE GROUND IS DISTURBED, DEPENDING UPON
###1888 
###1891 BEEN ESTIMATED IN AREAS LIKE NEW ENGLAND, THAT A VERY
###1893 HIGH PERCENT 30 OR 40 PERCENT OF WILD SEEDS MAY
###1898 ACTUALLY BE DISPERSED OR PLANTED BY ANTS. NOW I WOULD
###1902 LIKE TO SHOW YOU, UH OH, SOMETHING HAS HAPPENED HERE.
###1905 LET'S SEE IF WE CAN DO THIS AGAIN. IF NOT, WE HAVE
###1913 ALWAYS THE BIG GUYS IN THE BACK THERE. HERE WE GO,
###1918 LET'S LOOK AT THE NEXT SLIDES, EVERYTHING LOOKS LIKE
###1920 IT IS OKAY. FOR SOME STRANGE REASON. THE FIRST
###1928 EXAMPLE OF A SEED THAT I WANT TO SHOW YOU, DISPERSAL
###1931 IS ONE THAT GROWS OUTSIDE HERE THAT MANY OF YOU MAY
###1934 HAVE SEEN AND PASSED. AND I ENCOURAGE YOU TO STOP AND
###1936 LOOK AT THESE. THERE ARE SOME OF THESE GROWING UP
###1938 NEAR EVANS HALL, FOR SURE. THIS IS CALLED IMPATIENCE,
###1941 THIS PARTICULAR PLANT. HERE IS THE FLOWER AND HERE IS
###1945 THE FRUIT OF THE IMPATIENCE. THIS PARTICULAR FRUIT OF
###1948 THE IMPATIENCE, AND WE WILL LOOK AT IT IN A HIGHER
###1951 POWER HERE, THIS PARTICULAR FRUIT IS UNDER TENSION.
###1954 
###1958 THIS FRUIT ARE THE SEEDS. AND WHEN AN ANIMAL COMES BY
###1962 OR IN YOUR CASE YOU COME BY AND BRUSH NEXT TO THIS
###1965 SEED CAPSULE YOU CAUSE IT TO EXPLODE. AND WHEN IT
###1970 EXPLODES, THE TENSION IS RELEASED AND THE SEEDS ARE
###1973 CAST GREAT DISTANCES. IF IT IS AN ANIMAL THEY ARE
###1975 CAST INTO THE ANIMALS FUR. THEN THE ANIMAL WALKS AWAY,
###1978 PRESUMABLY THE SEED IS THEN DROPPED OFF AT A NEW AREA.
###1982 THIS IS AN INTERESTING EXAMPLE OF TOUCH AND IT WOULD
###1984 BE FACILITATED IN THE SENSE THAT IT IS ACTIVE. HERE
###1987 IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF SEED DISPERSAL, THIS IS PLANT
###1990 CALLED SALVIA, WHICH IS A PLANT THAT GROWS HERE IN
###1993 CALIFORNIA. HERE, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TOUCH THE
###1996 CAPSULE AND THAT RELEASES THIS SPRING TENSION AND THE
###2000 SEED GETS PROPELLED FORWARD. EXAMPLE OF WIND
###2004 DISPERSAL, THIS IS MILK WEED, LIKE WE TALKED ABOUT
###2007 WITH DANDELIONS IN WHICH THE SEEDS PRODUCE THIS TUFT
###2011 OF SOFT MATERIAL THAT MAKES THE SEED LIGHT AND EASILY
###2015 
###2018 COOKS, THESE PARTICULAR SEEDS, THIS IS NUTMEG, AND
###2024 THIS IS MACE. THIS IS THE MATERIAL THAT IS USED AS A
###2027 SPICE. IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE WHAT THIS SEED HAS
###2030 DONE OR PLANT HAS DONE IS PRODUCE THIS STRUCTURE WHICH
###2034 WE CALL MACE ON THE OUTSIDE OF THE SEED COVERING THE
###2038 SEED WHICH MADE IT ATTRACTIVE TO WHATEVER ANIMAL WAS
###2042 DISPERSING THIS SEED. THIS IS A RELATIVELY LARGE
###2045 SEED. SO, PERHAPS THE ANIMAL PUT THE WHOLE SEED ITS
###2047 BODY OR TOOK THE WHOLE SEED WITH IT AND THEN CONSUMED
###2050 IT GRADUALLY BECAUSE THE MACE, THE ANIMAL FOUND VERY
###2053 ATTRACTIVE. HERE IS AN EXAMPLE OF A SEED NOW OR A
###2058 PLANT. THIS IS A MEMBER OF THE PEA FAMILY IN WHICH THE
###2061 PLANT HAS MADE SORT OF THE IS CONTRASTING TYPE OF
###2063 SITUATION WHERE THERE IS SHOWY RED BASE AND BLACK
###2067 SEEDS, PRESUMABLY TO ATTRACT WHATEVER ANIMAL IS
###2070 INVOLVED. HERE IS ANOTHER ONE WHERE WE HAVE CONTRAST
###2073 BETWEEN THE BACKGROUND AND THE SEED TO AGAIN, ATTRACT
###2076 
###2081 ULTRAMARINE IN COLOR. A VERY UNUSUAL COLOR IN THE
###2083 PLANT KINGDOM. ONE HAS TO PRESUME, ALTHOUGH I DON'T
###2086 KNOW WHAT IT IS, THAT WHATEVER WAS USED TO DISPERSE
###2089 THE SEED MUST KEY IN ON THIS PARTICULAR COLOR. THIS
###2092 IS A VERY SUCCESSFUL ONE. THE LAST ONE I WANT TO SHOW
###2096 YOU LOOKS LIKE EYES BUT THEY ARE NOT. THESE ARE SEEDS
###2100 WHICH ARE DISPERSED BY ANIMALS, BY INSECTS, LARGE ANTS
###2103 IN THE TROPICS. AND ON THE OUTSIDE YOU CAN SEE THE
###2106 FRUIT WALL WHICH IS RED AND THIS WHITE MATERIAL IS
###2109 THIS NEW LAYER OF TISSUE FORMED WHICH IS ATTRACTIVE TO
###2112 INSECTS MOSTLY TO ANTS AND YOU CAN SEE THE BLACK SEED
###2116 INSIDE WHICH IS USED BY THE PLANT TO GROW ONCE IT IS
###2120 BURIED IN THE GROUND BY THE ANT. THESE ARE EXAMPLES
###2123 OF SEEDS OF VARIOUS TYPES OF PLANTS AND OF DISPERSAL
###2128 MECHANISM. OKAY. LET'S CONTINUE NOW AND WE WILL LOOK
###2133 AT THE SLIDES IN A SECOND.
###2136 OKAY, YOU CAN PUT THE SCREEN UP, MAYBE.
###2143 GERMINATION OF THE SEED. AFTER THE EMBRYO IS MATURE,
###2147 AFTER THE ENDOSPERM HAS BEEN ABSORBED IN THE COTYLEDON
###2152 OR IS STILL PRESENT IN THIS MATURE COCONUT, WHICH WE
###2155 HAVE HERE, I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT GERMINATION.
###2159 OF ALL OF THE STAGES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A PLANT
###2162 PROBABLY GERMINATION IS THE MOST DIFFICULT.
###2166 BECAUSE, THE PLANT HAS TO GET ITSELF
###2168 ESTABLISHED, HAS TO GET WATER, HAS TO START
###2171 PHOTOSYNTHESIZING ALL BEFORE THE NUTRIENTS ARE
###2175 EXHAUSTED INSIDE THE COTYLEDONS OR INSIDE THE
###2178 ENDOSPERM. SO, THIS IS THE MOST DIFFICULT TIME FOR
###2181 THE PLANT. I WANT TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE TYPES OF
###2186 ISSUES THAT SEEDS HAVE TO ADDRESS IN THEIR
###2189 ESTABLISHMENT. THE FIRST ISSUE WHICH I WOULD LIKE
###2192 TO POINT OUT TO YOU AND ALL OF YOU ARE AWARE OF
###2195 THIS, IS THAT HERE IS THE GROUND LEVEL, AND HERE IS
###2201 A SEED, LET'S SAY BURIED A COUPLE INCHES IN THE
###2204 
###2208 START PHOTOSYNTHESIZING BEFORE IT RUNS OUT OF
###2211 NUTRIENTS. IN ORDER TO GET UP TO THE TOP IT HAS TO
###2216 PASS ESSENTIALLY, A MINE FIELD OF POTENTIAL
###2218 OBSTACLES. PERHAPS ROCKS ARE IN THE WAY, PERHAPS
###2221 THERE IS HARD SOIL. HOW DOES THIS SEEDLING GET UP
###2225 TO THE TOP WITHOUT DAMAGING ITSELF? WE SAID THAT
###2235 WE HAD THE MERISTEM HERE. THE MERISTEM. THIS
###2240 MERISTEM, IF THE SEED GERMINATED LIKE SO, WOULD
###2244 HAVE TO PUSH UP AGAINST THE OBSTACLES THAT WERE IN
###2248 THE GROUND. THIS MERISTEM, AS YOU MIGHT GUESS, IS
###2250 A VERY DELICATE PART OF THE PLANT. THE PLANT DOES
###2255 NOT WANT TO USE THE MERISTEM AS BATTERING A RAM.
###2259 DOESN'T WANT TO USE THE MERISTEM. SO, LET ME SHOW
###2261 YOU WHAT PLANTS DO AND THIS IS WHY I INTRODUCED YOU
###2265 TO THE TERMS EPICOTYL AND HYPOCOTYL. IN MANY
###2269 PLANTS, INSTEAD OF USING THE MERISTEM AS
###2272 A BATTERING RAM, I WILL MAKE THE BIT HIGHER FOR
###2276 
###2282 FOLLOWING: HERE IS THE SEED, HERE IS THE AXIS,
###2290 HERE ARE THE COTYLEDONS AND HERE IS THE MERISTEM.
###2295 MERISTEM IS LOCATED RIGHT HERE. AND THIS IS THE
###2299 HYPOCOTYL.
###2299 SO WHAT THE PLANT DOES IS IT BENDS OVER. AND
###2308 THE BATTERING RAM BECOME THE HYPOCOTYL. THE HYPOCOTYL
###2313 PUSHES ITS WAY UP THROUGH THE SOIL AND THEN ONCE IT
###2317 GETS UP TO THE SURFACE OF THE SOIL IT STRAIGHTENS OUT
###2321 AND THE PLANT STARTS GROWING UPRIGHT. IN MANY PLANTS
###2324 THE HYPOCOTYL IS THE BATTERING RAM AND IN SOME PLANTS
###2328 LIKE PEAS, AND YOU WILL SEE SOME OF THESE IN THE LAB,
###2331 EPICOTYL IS THE BATTERING RAM.
###2338 FINALLY, I WANT TO MENTION THIS IS USUALLY THE
###2341 SITUATION IN EUDICOTS. IN MONOCOTS WE DON'T REALLY
###2348 HAVE A KIND OF A CLEAR EPICOTYL AND HYPOCOTYL, EVEN
###2351 THOUGH I DREW IT FOR YOU. TECHNICALLY IT IS THERE BUT
###2354 NEVER DEVELOPS TO A POINT WHERE IT HAS ANY FUNCTION.
###2357 
###2361 SEEDS PROTECT THEMSELVES, SEEDLINGS PROTECT THEIR
###2372 MERISTEM BY MAKING A COVER
###2383 OR A SHEATH, A COVER OR A
###2386 SHEATH, TO COVER THE MERISTEM.
###2392 REASON I WANT YOU TO KNOW THE NAME OF THE SHEATH
###2395 IS BECAUSE WE WILL RETURN TO IT IN A DISCUSSION VERY
###2397 SOON. I WANT YOU TO KNOW WHERE IT CAME FROM. SO,
###2401 HERE IS THE SEED, HERE IS THE SHOOT AXIS, HERE IS THE
###2411 MERISTEM. AND HERE IS THE COVER OR THE SHEATH.
###2418 COVERS IT UP LIKE SO. PROTECTS THAT MERISTEM. IT IS
###2422 THIS COVER WHICH GROWS UP THROUGH THE SOIL.
###2426 WE GIVE THIS COVER A SPECIAL NAME, THAT IS
###2430 REALLY WHAT I WANT YOU TO KNOW NOW, PUT IT IN YOUR
###2432 NOTE BECAUSE WE WILL RETURN TO IT. WE CALL IT THE
###2434 COLEOPTILE. COLEOPTILE. WE WILL RETURN TO IT LATER
###2440 ON.
###2447 FINALLY, WHAT I WANT TO DO BEFORE WE LEAVE TODAY
###2450 IS TO GIVE YOU A FEW LANDMARK THAT WE NEED TO HAVE AS
###2453 OUR VOCABULARY, ONLY A FEW FOR THE REST OF THE
###2457 
###2460 WHICH HAS ALREADY GERMINATED AND IS GROWING OUTSIDE AS
###2463 YOU HAVE ALREADY. I WANT TO PUT A FEW TERMS ON HERE
###2467 THAT WE'LL BE REFERRING TO FOR THE REST OF THE CLASS.
###2470 SO, FIRST OF ALL WE WILL PUT A LEAF ON HERE.
###2473 THIS WHOLE THING IS A LEAF.
###2477 A LEAF. MOST OF YOU KNOW THIS TERM. LEAF IS
###2480 DIVIDED INTO TWO PARTS. THE BLADE, WHICH IS WHAT YOU
###2485 KNOW OF AS THE LEAF OR THINK OF AS THE LEAF AND A
###2489 PORTION WHICH CONNECTS THE BLADE TO THE STEM, THAT IS
###2493 THE PETIOLE.
###2498 THE POINT OF ATTACHMENT OF THE LEAF, OF THE LEAF
###2509 TO THE STEM IS CALLED A NODE. HERE WE CAN HAVE
###2520 SEVERAL NODES. YOU HAVE A NODE HERE AND A NODE HERE
###2524 AND NODE HERE.
###2527 AND AS YOU MIGHT GUESS WE HAVE A NAME FOR THE
###2531 REGION BETWEEN NODES,
###2540 CALLED THE INTERNODE.
###2548 ONLY REALLY ONE OTHER THING THAT I NEED TO PUT
###2550 
###2555 WHICH YOU CAN SEE A SERIES OF NODES WHERE THE LEAF IS
###2558 ATTACHED AND A SERIES OF INTERNODES BETWEEN WHERE THE
###2562 LEAVES ARE ATTACHED. NOW WHY ARE NODES IMPORTANT?
###2566 WHY DO WE SPECIFICALLY DESIGNATE WHY A NODE IS
###2569 IMPORTANT? BECAUSE IF YOU LOOKED HERE IN THIS
###2575 REGION, THIS SORT OF ANGLE BETWEEN THE LEAF AND THE
###2581 STEM, THIS ANGLE IS CALLED AN AXLE. IF YOU LOOKED IN
###2585 THE AXLE OR THE ANGLE BETWEEN THE LEAF AND THE STEM,
###2589 YOU GENERALLY WOULD FIND BUMPS. AND WHAT ARE THESE
###2593 BUMPS? THESE BUMPS BECOME THE NEW BRANCHES. THAT IS
###2600 WHAT THEY BECOME, NEW BRANCHES. AND THEY ORIGINATE
###2605 FROM A BUMP WE CALL THAT BUMP BECAUSE IT IS IN AN IS
###2609 AXLE. WE CALL IT AXILLARY BUD.
###2621 ON THIS EXAMPLE HERE
###2622 I WANT YOU ALL TO LOOK AT THIS; HERE WE HAVE BRANCHES
###2626 GROWING OUT. EACH OF THESE BRANCHES, EVEN THOUGH
###2630 THERE IS NO LONGER A LEAF STILL ATTACHED HERE, EACH OF
###2633 THESE BRANCH WOULD BE GROWING OUT FROM A NODE. SO,
###2635 
###2638 BEEN A LEAF AND EVERY PLACE WHERE THERE IS A LEAF
###2641 THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN A NODE. TAKE A LOOK AT A PLANT
###2643 NEXT TIME. I WANT YOU TO REALIZE THAT ALL OF THE
###2648 VARIETY THAT YOU SEE OUTSIDE OF PLANTS EXCEPT FOR
###2650 FRUITS AND FLOWERS IS BASED UPON CHANGES IN LEAVES,
###2655 PETIOLES, STEMS, AXILLARY BUDS, BRANCHES. ALL OF THE
###2660 VARIETY. JUST A FEW SIMPLE ORGANS CHANGE AND GIVE YOU
###2662 ALL OF THE DIVERSITY OF FORM.
###2664 LET'S LOOK AT THE LAST SERIES OF SLIDES. AND
###2670 REALIZE THAT THIS PLANT HERE IS A GENERALIZED PLANT.
###2678 OKAY. HERE IS OUR GENERALIZED PLANT WITH THE
###2680 LANDMARKS WE PUT ON THERE A SECOND AGO, AND WHAT I
###2685 WANT TO POINT OUT TO YOU ARE THE NODES, THE INTERNODE,
###2689 THE VEGETATIVE AXILLARY BUD, WHICH HAS GROWN OUT.
###2693 HERE IS AN EXAMPLE OF AN AXILLARY BUD THAT HASN'T
###2695 GROWN OUT YET. AND WHAT I DIDN'T PUT ON THE PICTURE
###2698 BECAUSE THERE WAS NO ROOM AS WELL AS SHOOT SYSTEM
###2701 
###2704 WILL SPEND TIME LOOKING AT THE ROOT SYSTEM. HERE IS
###2707 GERMINATION THAT WE TALKED ABOUT WHEN A SEEDLING IS
###2710 ESTABLISHED. NOW, THIS IS IN A MONOCOT. HERE IS THE
###2714 COLEOPTILE AND THE COLEOPTILE IS PROTECTING THE
###2718 MERISTEM WHICH IS BURIED DOWN HERE AT THIS NODE
###2720 REGION. AS THE COLEOPTILE GROWS UP TO THE SOIL IT
###2724 PUSHES SOIL AWAY AND AS SOON AS IT PERCEIVES LIGHT IT
###2727 STOPS GROWING AND THE SHOOT SYSTEM, THE APICAL
###2730 MERISTEM SYSTEM, WHICH IS CONTAINED WITHIN, BURSTS
###2732 THROUGH IT AND THE SEEDLING THEN IS ABLE TO
###2735 PHOTOSYNTHESIZE. HERE IS AN EXAMPLE NOW OF ONE IN
###2738 WHICH THE, IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE, THE HYPOCOTYL IS
###2741 THE BATTERING RAM, AS WE TALKED ABOUT BEFORE. IT IS
###2743 THE REGION BELOW WHERE THE COTYLEDONS ARE ATTACHED,
###2746 AND NOTICE, THIS IS THE PART THIS IS PUSHING UP
###2748 AGAINST THE SOIL. NOT THE MERISTEM. BY THE TIME THE
###2752 SEEDLING GETS TO THE SOIL SURFACE THE SEEDLING NOW
###2755 
###2757 INSIDE HERE OR OVER HERE, IS PROTECTED FROM BATTERING
###2760 OF THE SOIL. LAST SLIDE YOU WILL SEE THIS IN THE LAB
###2764 THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS. THIS REGION HERE IS THE
###2767 BATTERING RAM, THE MERISTEM IS CONTAINED WITHIN HERE.
###2771 HAVE A NICE WEEKEND SEE YOU ON MONDAY, I HOPE.
