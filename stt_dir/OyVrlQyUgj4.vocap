###100 Silly old morning, Uncle Harry.
###102 They'll sort you out a loader.
###109 Stoddard.
###111 -Hastings. -Ah, thank you.
###114 Hastings?
###116 Now, I shall need at least six.
###117 No, no, no, no, eight,
###120 for the Tetras à l'Hongroise.
###122 I shall ask the hotel to cook us some tomorrow.
###124 It's not like ordering them in a shop, Poirot --
###126 I've got to shoot the damn things.
###128 I have every faith in your marksmanship, Hastings.
###131 ROGER: You ready, old man?
###133 Ah, Roger.
###135 Mr. Poirot, it's taken me 10 years to get him up onto
###137 Uncle Harry's moor -- I don't want you missing the drive.
###139 HASTINGS: I'm ready.
###141 For God's sake, Harry, it's not much.
###144 It'll mean I can marry again.
###147 £300 is nothing to you.
###150 Look bloody odd, wouldn't it, Jack?
###152 Me putting that sort of money
###154 the way of my maid and my gamekeeper?
###156 Damn you!
###158 I sometimes wonder which of us was born a bastard.
###164 Jack?
###168 Stoddard.
###170 Yes, Mr. Roger.
###172 Look after Mr. Archie, will you?
###175 Aye-aye, sir.
###176 Right, Mr. Archie, let's have a look here.
###179 Now, what do you think?
###184 Good luck, darling.
###186 Mm.
###190 -Bonne chance, mon ami. -Thanks, old man.
###198 ZOE: Good shooting, Archie.
###202 ARCHIE: Thanks, eh.
###213 Poor old Archie.
###215 Hasn't a clue, I'm afraid.
###218 He's your cousin, isn't he?
###219 Yes. You've seen the guns he turned up with?
###221 [ Laughter ]
###223 Still, he's only a schoolteacher,
###225 so on his salary, what could you expect?
###228 Now, this is you, old man.
###231 -Good shooting. -Thanks.
###250 [ Whistling and calling ]
###269 Into your shoulder, tight.
###271 Stroke the cheek, stroke the cheek, tight,
###274 right, 90° angle.
###276 Now, break!
###278 Well, let's hope for a good bag.
###280 MAN: They're breaking, Mr. Pace.
###282 Here they come.
###287 [ Gunshot ]
###288 [ Gunshots ]
###298 Damn it.
###307 [ Gunshots continue in distance ]
###314 M. Poirot?
###317 -M. Poirot? -Oh!
###319 Pardon, madame.
###321 The popping, you know.
###323 Why did you come, M. Poirot?
###327 The red grouse, it must be eaten fresh,
###329 while the gun is still smoking, as we say.
###333 Ah, a gourmet?
###336 POIROT: You are too kind, Mme. Havering,
###338 but it is most rare in my country, the tetras.
###340 We make do with la gelinotte, the wood grouse,
###343 with a flavor -- it is piney.
###345 Piney?
###347 Yes, this is not a word, "piney"?
###349 Like — Like a pine tree?
###351 Oh, "piney."
###353 Yes!
###356 It's a very good word.
###363 Here we are, sir.
###367 Let's load, quick.
###373 Watch him, Stoddard!
###378 Ah!
###379 STODDARD: You've hit Mr. Pace!
###381 Mr. Pace!
###384 You bloody fool!
###390 You bloody, bloody fool!
###393 You damn near killed me!
###396 And what the hell were you doing, Stoddard!
###398 You were supposed to be looking after him!
###401 Call yourself a gamekeeper?
###403 You can't even pass muster as a nursery maid!
###407 Argh! Will you give me a handkerchief?
###418 Mr. Archie is a complete idiot.
###423 ZOE: It looks like Uncle Harry is all right.
###426 Well, I'd better get back to Hunter's Lodge --
###429 make sure Mrs. Middleton
###430 has everything under control for lunch.
###433 She's only with us pro tern.
###435 [ Gunshots continue ]
###437 M. Poirot,
###439 may I entrust you with a task?
###442 Madame?
###443 ZOE: Look after cousin Archie for me, will you?
###445 I couldn't bear it
###446 if he went back to his little cottage and brooded.
###448 He will not be able to brood
###449 in the company of Hercule Poirot, madame.
###452 You are a treasure.
###466 Oh.
###468 [ Shivers ]
###487 ZOE: Ellie, where's Mrs. Middleton?
###489 Up in her room, mum.
###492 She done most of it.
###493 She left us a note to get on setting it out.
###495 She's impossible.
###498 Still, it all looks very nice.
###501 -Thank you, mum. -Thank you, mum.
###502 I'm going to lie down for a moment.
###504 I've got a wretched earache.
###506 The wind up there is like a knife.
###508 It's been snowing up on the moor, you know.
###511 Others will be here in about half an hour.
###517 Mrs. Middleton?
###537 [ Speaking indistinctly ]
###541 POIROT: For two hours, I am waiting in the snow, Hastings!
###544 The ice, it is forming on my bones!
###551 Ah, a log fire —
###553 one of the better provisions of the English.
###556 HASTINGS: Roger was saying
###558 you keep an eye on the place for the family.
###560 Yes, I'm local -- the poor relation that's available.
###564 [ Hastings laughs ]
###566 Damned invidious it is, too.
###567 What is?
###568 Some of my pupils' families live six to a room.
###571 This place lies empty 40 weeks of the year.
###573 They only come up here for the shooting.
###576 Mrs. Middleton, where's my wife, do you know?
###578 -She's up in her room, sir. -Her room?
###581 She has an earache, sir, I'm told.
###583 Well, she damn well ought to be here.
###586 That sort of thing won't get him very far,
###589 not with Zoe.
###590 Will you have some more punch, girls?
###593 Thank you, Mr. Payne.
###595 Ah — excuse me.
###603 Uncle Harry, I'm really sorry about your hand.
###606 Don't think I'll take up grouse shooting as a career.
###609 Delighted to hear it.
###612 A fellow asked me the other day --
###614 a Bolshie, you know — asked me,
###616 had I actually made anything during my workless life.
###620 "Certainly," I said.
###622 "I made a lot of friends, I made a lot of enemies,
###625 and I've made a lot of money."
###632 You all right, Poirot?
###633 My feet, Hastings,
###635 are still blocks of ice,
###636 my lungs, they are full of the gunpowder on the fresh air,
###639 and my ears are full of the popping,
###640 and I am ill.
###642 No, I am not all right, Hastings.
###643 Not at all.
###644 Um, au revoir, M. Poirot.
###647 Au revoir.
###648 -Good to have met you. -Thank you.
###650 I have to be off.
###651 It's a six-mile bike ride for me, I'm afraid.
###653 You are leaving?
###656 One can leave?
###658 Mr. Poirot, goodbye.
###661 Ah, M. Havering,
###662 goodbye, thank you.
###665 Next year, we'll put you up at the house.
###667 No, the hotel's fine. It's very comfortable.
###669 -Bye, Roger. -Goodbye.
###672 Cheerio, thanks.
###674 Hope his hand gets better.
###676 I'm sure it will.
###678 ZOE: Bye, Archie. Take care.
###680 Oh!
###682 Oh, I'm sorry!
###684 It's all right. I'm all right.
###687 Are you all right, Zoe?
###689 Oh, yes, I had a filthy earache. I'm fine now.
###692 Take care of yourself, Archie.
###695 Yes...yes, indeed.
###697 Well, uh...
###699 Bye, then.
###729 I'll get myself ready, then I'll be off to London.
###732 I should make the 5:00.
###734 Darling, couldn't you catch the 6:15?
###736 -Why? -Mrs. Middleton wants to go
###738 down to Stoddard's place to pick up some game.
###740 Oh, darling.
###742 She makes such a fuss.
###745 HARRY: Bloody temporary staff.
###747 Don't know what that agency's playing at.
###749 Ellie has to walk four miles,
###751 and you never hear her complaining.
###754 It would be so much easier if you gave her a lift.
###757 She'd only have to walk back.
###758 All right, all right, I'll do it.
###761 Mrs. Middleton?
###764 Joan, would you like a lift, too?
###767 Mr. Havering could drop you off on the way to Mr. Stoddard's.
###768 Oh, thank you, mum.
###770 ZOE: Come along, then.
###789 HASTINGS: I'm sorry you didn't enjoy it, Poirot.
###792 My enjoyment is yet to come, Hastings.
###796 I have given to the chef his instructions.
###799 What's that?
###801 Mon Dieu. Look at this, Hastings!
###805 I am a corpse waiting to die.
###807 I shall not survive to enjoy my Tetras à I'Hongroise.
###811 [ Whimpers ]
###814 [ Train whistle blows ]
###832 MAN: All aboard!
###834 It's the 6:15 going to all stations to London King's Cross.
###853 [ Train whistle blows ]
###886 [ Dog whimpers ]
###888 Now, you stay there.
###892 You stay.
###899 [ Train whistle blows ]
###954 Hey, that's my bike!
###984 [ Rattling ]
###993 [ Gunshot, door closes ]
###1011 Mr. Stoddard! Mr. Stoddard!
###1016 Fetch the police. There's been a shooting.
###1019 Go!
###1022 Go!
###1050 [ Knocking on door ]
###1052 FORGAN: And you can confirm that this is Mr. Harrington Pace?
###1055 MRS. MIDDLETON: Yes, sir.
###1056 Mrs. Havering's in a terrible state.
###1058 I've given her something to help her sleep.
###1062 I let the killer in -- that's what I can't get over.
###1066 FORGAN: Describe this man.
###1068 He was wearing a big overcoat,
###1070 and he had a beard -- a great, bushy thing.
###1074 He said he wanted to see Mr. Pace,
###1076 so I showed him into the gun room
###1077 like I always do with visitors.
###1079 FORGAN: Yes?
###1080 MRS. MIDDLETON: I went back into the living room
###1083 and started clearing up, and then heard the sound.
###1086 The shot.
###1088 Like someone knocking on the door of hell, it was.
###1100 POIROT: [ Coughing ]
###1105 [ Footsteps approach ]
###1107 [ Knock on door ]
###1110 Who is it?
###1112 HASTINGS: It's me.
###1114 Come in, Hastings.
###1117 There's been a murder.
###1119 Who has been murdered?
###1121 Harrington Pace, up at Hunter's Lodge,
###1123 shot with one of his own revolvers.
###1125 Mon Dieu!
###1127 [ Scoffs ]
###1128 Oh!
###1130 You're still not well, Poirot.
###1132 Oh, I must confess, I feel a little weak.
###1136 You get back into bed now.
###1141 You can leave this to me.
###1143 -Comment? -This investigation.
###1144 You can leave it to me.
###1146 I'll report back to you, of course.
###1148 I know these people, Poirot,
###1149 and I've got one or two ideas already.
###1151 What are these ideas, Hastings?
###1153 You just relax.
###1156 Hastings, will you please stop tapping your nose
###1160 in that theatrical manner,
###1161 and tell me all that you know?
###1167 I don't seem to be able to find that Mrs. Middleton, Sarge.
###1171 What do you mean, "can't find her"?
###1174 Oh, this is the Scotland Yard fellow.
###1178 Find her!
###1180 Right ho, Sarge.
###1193 Japp, Scotland Yard.
###1195 Sergeant Forgan, Ashby Pickard.
###1197 Pleasant drive, sir?
###1199 Are you trying to be funny?
###1200 No, sir.
###1202 Rich, was he, the victim?
###1204 Oh, yes, sir, Harrington Pace —
###1207 owned a stud outside Newmarket,
###1209 a house in Belgravia, and mooring in Monte Carlo.
###1212 And who stands to benefit?
###1213 Practically all of it goes to his nephew, Roger Havering.
###1215 And where is he?
###1217 Spent the night at his club in London.
###1219 Yeah, we phoned him there.
###1221 He's coming back on the first train, sir.
###1228 He was shot by a man who just turned up at the door
###1230 asking to see him.
###1232 Must have got away through that window.
###1234 Hmm.
###1235 FORGAN: It was the gamekeeper who came and got us.
###1238 Oh, he stood to gain, too, sir.
###1239 He's the only other real beneficiary.
###1241 -Oh, yes? -FORGAN: Pace left him £4,000.
###1244 Did he, by God?
###1246 Excuse me, Sergeant, but she's not on the premises.
###1249 She's definitely gone.
###1250 Who's that?
###1252 The housekeeper, Mrs. Middleton.
###1254 She showed the killer into the house.
###1255 She's our chief witness.
###1257 Better initiate a search. How many men have you got?
###1260 Men, sir?
###1263 Just the one, sir — him.
###1265 Well, you'll have to make optimum use of your resources,
###1267 won't you?
###1270 Sir.
###1291 Roger, what a terrible thing. I'm awfully sorry.
###1294 Thank you. I must go straight to the lodge. Zoe needs me.
###1297 I think we ought to pop in and see Poirot on the way.
###1300 He's feeling a bit poorly, so I'm handling the case,
###1302 but we must keep him informed.
###1307 I am profoundly ill, as you can see, but...
###1311 -I will do my best to assist. -Thank you.
###1313 Uh, one thing, M. Havering,
###1317 -if you please. -Yes?
###1320 Pardon, but what were you doing when your uncle was killed?
###1323 Oh, it's all right. Roger was on his way to London.
###1325 I spent the night at my club.
###1328 Police rang me there.
###1330 It's a horrible business.
###1331 You went to London by train?
###1333 ROGER: Yes, I caught the 6:15.
###1335 You talk to anyone on that train?
###1336 No.
###1338 POIROT: You arrived at your club at what time?
###1340 Oh, about 10:00 -- Actually, it was a bit later,
###1343 I walked down from King's Cross.
###1345 Ah, that's fine. Thank you.
###1350 Hastings?
###1355 We'll get on up to the lodge, Poirot.
###1357 POIROT: Very well, Hastings.
###1378 WOMAN: Hello, reception desk.
###1380 Hello, yes, this is Hercule Poirot,
###1382 room number 5,
###1383 I require, if you please, a railway timetable.
###1390 ZOE: I was in here with Mr. Pace
###1393 when there was a knock at the door.
###1395 I heard Mrs. Middleton go to answer it,
###1397 so I got up to see who it was.
###1399 Yes.
###1401 It was a man I didn't recognize, so I waited for Mrs. Middleton
###1405 to show him into the gun room and come and announce him.
###1409 What did he look like?
###1411 Average-ish height, hat,
###1414 specs, I think.
###1416 I couldn't be sure.
###1419 Beard.
###1420 What sort of beard?
###1422 Bushy.
###1424 He looked like one of those anarchists
###1427 in a cartoon in "Punch."
###1429 Do you remember what time this man arrived?
###1431 About a quarter to 7:00.
###1436 JAPP: Please go on.
###1437 Well, Mrs. Middleton knocked a minute later,
###1444 said the man wouldn't give his name,
###1446 but wanted to see Mr. Pace.
###1448 Harry said
###1450 he'd see what he wanted.
###1452 He got up, and a few minutes later, we heard the shot.
###1456 HASTINGS: The housekeeper,
###1458 Mrs. Middleton, she was in the room with you, was she?
###1461 Yes, she was clearing the drinks glasses.
###1464 Did this man arrive by car?
###1466 I don't know. I didn't hear anything.
###1470 Would you normally hear a car arriving?
###1473 ZOE: Oh, yes.
###1474 Yes, if he came by car, he didn't bring it up to the house.
###1489 You carry on here.
###1490 Yes, sir.
###1492 This hotel of yours presentable, is it?
###1494 Not too bad.
###1495 I'll book myself in. What are their sandwiches like?
###1498 Sandwiches? No idea.
###1500 Tell you what, I put my money on this Middleton woman
###1503 being in league with the killer.
###1505 On her own admission, she shows the fellow in.
###1507 The next morning, she's gone.
###1508 Yeah, but she's the only person
###1510 who's had a proper look at the killer.
###1512 What if she saw through his disguise?
###1513 Disguise?
###1515 What disguise?
###1516 Bushy beard and glasses?
###1522 And suppose she saw who it was under the disguise.
###1525 Perhaps we better start looking for another body, not a witness.
###1538 ANSTRUTHER: Well, Mr. Poirot, you get that down you,
###1542 and I reckon you'll live to fight another day.
###1545 Oh.
###1548 Thank you very much, Mr. Anstruther.
###1550 -[ Knock on door ] -Come in.
###1553 Ah, Chief Inspector Japp.
###1556 Hastings, this is Mr. Anstruther
###1558 of the London, Midland, and Scottish Railway.
###1560 Afternoon, gents.
###1561 Well, if you'll excuse me, I have to get back.
###1565 A railway don't run itself, you know.
###1567 I'll drop in tomorrow
###1569 with some more blackberry tea.
###1570 Thank you very much.
###1572 ANSTRUTHER: Oh, and don't forget my bike, will you?
###1574 Certainly not.
###1575 That bike means a lot to me, that bike does.
###1578 Man and boy, I've had that bike.
###1581 Au revoir.
###1583 Pauvre Mr. Anstruther.
###1586 He is a man obsessed.
###1588 Obsessed with what?
###1590 His bike?
###1591 Yes, indeed, Chief Inspector.
###1593 It has been stolen.
###1595 He is also obsessed with other things.
###1598 He knows every final detail
###1599 about the movements of the trains
###1601 in and out of his little station.
###1603 Oh, yes? Been doing some investigation, have we?
###1607 POIROT: How can I, Chief Inspector? I am prostrated.
###1610 I toy with the little lines of inquiry, that is all.
###1614 You, of course, will be well ahead of me.
###1617 Well, we've got a description of the murderer.
###1620 Yes, a man of medium height wearing a broad-brimmed hat,
###1624 sporting a beard that is large and fluffy.
###1626 How did you know that?
###1627 That is a description of the man
###1629 who stole the bicycle of M. Anstruther.
###1631 It is essential that we find it, Hastings.
###1634 Oh, right.
###1636 Find what?
###1639 The bicycle!
###1641 Also, I am most anxious
###1643 to establish whether or not
###1645 M. Archie Havering had an alibi
###1647 for the time that M. Pace was shot.
###1650 [ Children talking ]
###1653 You didn't really like your uncle, did you?
###1655 What are you implying?
###1657 Look, I'm sorry about this.
###1660 I'm afraid I have to ask you.
###1661 Poirot wants to know what you were doing yesterday evening
###1664 at the time of your uncle's death.
###1665 How dare you?
###1668 What on earth makes you think
###1670 I'd want to kill a man like my Uncle Harry?
###1673 I tell you, he was beneath contempt.
###1676 Mean and selfish.
###1680 You know Stoddard the gamekeeper is his half-brother,
###1682 one of his father's bastards.
###1684 Good lord!
###1685 His own blood, and he used him like a servant.
###1690 How did he get his money in the first place?
###1693 I'll tell you.
###1695 He cheated his partner in County Mayo,
###1698 then used the money for profiteering on the war.
###1701 And people liked him!
###1703 He boasted about it, and people applauded!
###1706 [ Door opens ]
###1709 Clear off!
###1725 [ Bed springs squeak ]
###1729 [ Telephone rings ]
###1737 Hello?
###1738 POIROT: Chief Inspector?
###1740 Ah, how's the cold, Poirot?
###1742 POIROT: It is not a cold. It is a deadly fever!
###1745 Hmm, nasty.
###1747 POIROT: However, I have asked M. and Mme. Havering
###1750 to come to the hotel.
###1752 I am now convinced that M. Roger Havering
###1754 has not been telling the truth.
###1757 You say, M. Havering,
###1759 that you arrived at London at 9:00.
###1761 The only witness that you can produce
###1764 is the doorman at your club where you arrived at 10:00.
###1767 You say that you spent this hour
###1769 walking between King's Cross at St. James', and yet,
###1773 you can describe none of your movements,
###1775 no events, no street names, rien -- nothing.
###1778 This isn't the line I've been following at all, Poirot.
###1781 What are you driving at?
###1782 POIROT: I am driving at
###1784 a curve in the line of the local railway.
###1786 A loop of iron which connects Ashby Pickard
###1789 with the little station of Ashby le Walken.
###1791 What?
###1792 POIROT: It is quite possible, M. Havering,
###1794 for a man to catch the 6:15 train at one station
###1796 and get off at the next.
###1798 With the aid of a bicycle, he returns to Hunter's Lodge
###1801 disguised with a beard
###1802 and wearing a broad-brimmed hat.
###1804 He shoots the man he wishes to shoot.
###1806 Then he catches the 7:20 from Ashby Pickard,
###1809 a train that is faster than the 6:15,
###1810 which will get him to London in time to be at his club by 10:00.
###1813 My God. You're serious, aren't you?
###1817 It is a serious affair!
###1819 A man has been killed
###1820 and you are about to be accused of his murder.
###1823 Me?
###1824 JAPP: You, sir.
###1826 Do you not see it, monsieur?
###1828 You must tell us of your movements that night.
###1832 Absolutely not.
###1834 I can't.
###1836 For God's sake, Roger, why not?
###1838 I just can't.
###1841 Well, Poirot?
###1844 Carry on, Chief Inspector.
###1847 I would like you to accompany me
###1848 to the local police station, sir.
###1850 What?
###1852 I wish to question you in connection with the murder
###1855 of your uncle, Mr. Harrington Pace,
###1857 and with the disappearance of the housekeeper, Mrs. Middleton.
###1862 [ Telephone rings ]
###1867 Yes? It's for you, Chief Inspector.
###1873 Japp.
###1877 Right.
###1880 What is it?
###1882 They found Mrs. Middleton.
###1911 We're not late, are we?
###1913 JAPP: No, she hasn't arrived yet.
###1917 Shouldn't you be in bed?
###1919 Possibly, but, please, do not fuss.
###1921 You looked like you were at death's door last night.
###1923 POIROT: Unfortunately, Chief Inspector,
###1925 it was my appetite that was dead.
###1927 My Tetras à I'Hongroise, it was fed to the cat.
###1945 Mrs. Middleton?
###1947 Yes, I'm Mrs. Middleton.
###1950 Well, what have you brought me here for?
###1959 The instructions from the agency
###1961 were to go to Ashby Pickard by train and I'd be met there,
###1965 and the engagement would be for one month.
###1968 So, I did.
###1970 And I was met by a very nice Irish lady who --
###1973 Irish? You sure?
###1975 Oh, yes! She said she was Mrs. Pace.
###1978 And she said there'd been an embarrassing mix-up.
###1982 What sort of mix-up?
###1983 She said they were canceling the shooting this year
###1986 and there was no household for me to keep.
###1988 So, anyway, she said she'd be grateful
###1991 if I didn't say anything to the agency
###1994 because she didn't want them
###1996 to think she was unreliable, you know?
###1999 And she was very generous.
###2001 She said she'd give me two months' wages in lieu
###2005 if I'd agree not to put myself back on the agency books
###2008 for a full month.
###2009 JAPP: And you agreed?
###2011 Yes! She seemed very nice.
###2020 You kept very quiet through all that.
###2023 I am unwell -- and it changes everything,
###2026 this testimony of Mme. Middleton.
###2028 JAPP: Well, it all seems pretty straightforward to me.
###2030 We still have to find this other woman
###2032 who pretended to be a housekeeper.
###2033 Agreed?
###2035 I think it would be more fruitful
###2037 to find the bicycle of M. Anstruther.
###2039 What on earth for?
###2041 Because, Hastings, it was stolen
###2043 to transport a murderer to Hunter's Lodge.
###2045 Why has it disappeared?
###2047 Sir, sir?
###2048 What is it, Forgan?
###2050 It's Mr. Havering, sir.
###2051 He's asking to see you.
###2055 I'll tell you what I was doing if you promise not to tell Zoe.
###2059 Well, let's hope it won't be necessary.
###2061 I'll make no promises.
###2064 Very well, then.
###2066 I was with Lord Quamby.
###2068 Lord Quamby? The racing earl?
###2071 Yes, he's chairman of the board in charge of on course betting.
###2075 I wanted him to get me off the hook.
###2077 Well, buy me some time on a couple of my debts.
###2080 Why were you so reluctant to tell us this?
###2082 A few months ago, you see, I promised Zoe
###2085 that I'd never back another horse as long as I lived.
###2088 And will Lord Quamby verify that you were with him?
###2091 Of course he will.
###2099 Tell me, Mlle. Joan, on the night of the murder,
###2103 when was the last time that you saw Mme. Middleton?
###2107 She was in the car with Mr. Havering
###2109 when they dropped me off at home.
###2110 He was on his way to the station,
###2113 and he gave her a lift over to Mr. Stoddard's house.
###2116 Mr. Stoddard the gamekeeper?
###2118 Yes, sir.
###2119 Ah, yes, of course, M. Stoddard.
###2123 You hope to be his wife one day, do you not?
###2126 No one's supposed to know that, sir.
###2128 I comprehend.
###2130 Tell me more about Mme. Middleton.
###2133 JOAN: Oh, she was that strict.
###2135 Always leaving little notes about the place, criticizing.
###2139 Mr. Stoddard didn't like her.
###2142 They used to be quite sharp with each other.
###2146 Did Mme. Middleton ever talk to you about herself?
###2149 JOAN: No, not really.
###2151 She said she were from Ireland.
###2153 Mayo, I think.
###2156 She always kept herself to herself, like.
###2163 Mlle. Joan, this apron?
###2166 Oh, that's Mrs. Middleton's, sir.
###2168 Oh. Thank you. That will be all.
###2174 So, when Harrington Pace was living in Ireland,
###2177 he cheated his partner and ruined him.
###2179 Then this mysterious woman, who was also from County Mayo,
###2183 turns up and replaces Mrs. Middleton.
###2186 She was probably a relation of the ruined man.
###2189 She opens the door to her accomplice,
###2191 the fellow with the bushy beard,
###2193 they kill Pace, and both of them disappear.
###2196 Absolument, mon ami.
###2202 You have the story exact.
###2204 Oh.
###2209 STODDARD: In your hunt countries, of course,
###2212 they use your gazehound,
###2214 hunts by sight.
###2216 For the moistness in our air,
###2218 we favor a dog that hunts by scent.
###2222 And I tell you,
###2225 she's a prime example of that, aren't you, huh?
###2228 She's the best of her kind, she is.
###2231 That is most interesting.
###2233 Tell me, M. Stoddard, if you please,
###2236 on the night that M. Pace was killed,
###2239 Mme. Middleton came to your house
###2241 to collect some game birds, did she not?
###2243 No.
###2246 Oh, you're right. I was expecting her,
###2250 but she never arrived.
###2253 I didn't see her till much later,
###2254 when she came running down lane to tell me about the shooting.
###2256 Chief Inspector, there is at Hunter's Lodge
###2261 a telephone, is there not?
###2263 Yes, there is.
###2264 Then why did not Mme. Middleton herself
###2267 telephone to the police?
###2269 Aye, it crossed my mind then.
###2271 What she said was
###2274 that Mrs. Havering was near hysterical at the horror of it.
###2277 She wanted to get her to sleep before the police got there,
###2281 so she sent me to fetch them.
###2284 Ah, yes, she needed the time alone in the house.
###2289 Yes, of course, of course.
###2292 M. Stoddard,
###2295 would you consider to involve your excellent dog
###2298 in a little experiment?
###2299 She is clever with her nose, you say?
###2302 She's got a nose that would
###2304 scent a poppy in a bit of slurry, she has.
###2307 Eh bien, M. Stoddard, our poppy, it is in here.
###2317 It is essential that we determine
###2319 the whereabouts of the person
###2321 who calls herself Mme. Middleton.
###2324 Easier said than done. Not a glimmer.
###2327 Road, rail, local gossip, nothing.
###2329 -That's why I think -- -Eh-up, eh-up!
###2332 -[ Dog whimpering ] -What's it, girl?
###2334 What's the matter, girl, huh?
###2335 What's it, girl, huh?
###2337 Hey, hey, hey, hey.
###2340 So it's been buried?
###2342 Some thing.
###2351 It's a coat.
###2356 JAPP: And a hat.
###2364 [ Dog whimpers ]
###2372 Hey, look at this.
###2373 Swipe me.
###2376 Bon! M. Anstruther, he will be most pleased.
###2382 [ Whimpers ]
###2384 What a clever dog.
###2427 Everyone here?
###2428 In the gun room, sir.
###2441 M. Harrington Pace was not a likeable man.
###2446 He used his wealth to control his friends and his family.
###2452 For example, M. Stoddard, his unacknowledged brother,
###2456 he employed as a gamekeeper,
###2457 but refused to lend him the £300 necessary
###2461 to purchase his house and to get married.
###2466 His nephew, M. Archie Havering,
###2468 he used as an estate manager,
###2471 paying him not with money, but with promises of a legacy.
###2474 His other nephew, M. Roger Havering,
###2476 was also made to dance the attendance
###2479 by assurances of wealth to come.
###2481 There are, I think, here motives for murder.
###2486 N'est-ce pas?
###2487 Now, look here, Poirot —
###2489 POIROT: No, no, no, please, M. Roger,
###2491 I make not the accusations. I merely speculate.
###2494 For instance, we know that
###2495 you could not have possibly committed the murder,
###2498 because at 6:15 on that night,
###2503 you were boarding a train for London.
###2516 But what we did not know
###2519 was that there was another passenger
###2521 who also boarded that train.
###2528 This person
###2530 alighted from the train at the very next stop
###2533 and stole the bicycle of my friend,
###2535 M. Anstruther -- a curious thing to do, huh?
###2540 Hey, that's my bike!
###2543 POIROT: But the next thing that this person did
###2546 was even more curious.
###2551 He buried the bicycle.
###2554 Then he buried all the necessary accoutrements
###2557 of the bearded man...
###2562 ...and turned himself back into Mme. Middleton.
###2567 Mrs. Middleton was the bearded man?
###2571 But, yes, Hastings.
###2572 You see, we only had the word of Mme. Middleton herself
###2575 that a bearded man came to the house that night,
###2577 but, of course, that was not true.
###2579 No, I saw him.
###2581 Mme. Havering, if you please,
###2582 we will come to that in a minute.
###2583 HASTINGS: It's as I've said all along,
###2585 we've got to find this Mrs. Middleton.
###2587 ROGER: Well, may I suggest
###2589 that you get on and do just that.
###2591 So far, all you've done is ask impertinent questions
###2594 and treat respectable people like a lot of criminals!
###2597 Please, M. Roger, do not be in such haste.
###2600 We may know that you did not commit a murder,
###2602 but there are other things which are not yet so clear.
###2604 This crime was of a daring most extraordinary.
###2610 It had to be like clockwork.
###2613 And the spurious Mme. Middleton
###2616 had to have an accomplice to wind the spring.
###2619 JOAN: Sorry, Mrs. Middleton.
###2621 POIROT: At a quarter to 6:00 on the night of the murder,
###2624 this spring, it was ready for release.
###2626 The guests had departed,
###2629 Mlle. Ellie had already gone home,
###2632 and Mlle. Joan had been offered a lift
###2634 in your car, M. Havering.
###2638 Mlle. Joan was duly dropped at her cottage.
###2641 Mme. Middleton was then to be driven to
###2643 the home of M. Stoddard to collect some game birds,
###2646 but, of course, she never arrived.
###2648 She was undergoing a transformation.
###2653 It was essential, you see,
###2655 that a suspect should be seen to alight from the train
###2657 at the very next stop,
###2659 a suspect that could well be
###2660 M. Roger Havering in disguise.
###2664 Why should I try to incriminate myself?
###2667 Because, M. Havering, you had planned most carefully
###2670 your alibi -- your meeting with Lord Quamby,
###2673 which you would seem to have every reason for keeping secret,
###2676 but once you were forced to reveal it and were released,
###2679 it was most unlikely that the police
###2681 would suspect you for a second time.
###2683 You're talking complete rubbish.
###2685 POIROT: No, no, no, I think not, M. Havering.
###2687 You see, while you continued your journey to London,
###2694 Mme. Middleton returned to Hunter's Lodge.
###2699 [ Door closing ]
###2702 Your uncle was a very wealthy man.
###2705 In time, you would inherit his fortune,
###2707 but your gambling debts grew heavier,
###2710 and M. Pace refused to bail you out.
###2712 You desperately needed the money now,
###2715 and so on that fateful night,
###2718 M. Pace was shot
###2720 in cold blood.
###2725 Prove it!
###2727 You just prove it.
###2730 That is a lying slander.
###2732 You're going to find yourself in court, Mr. bloody Poirot!
###2735 And who is this Mrs. Middleton
###2737 I'm meant to have been an accomplice of?
###2739 You can't even find her.
###2740 So you busy yourself accusing everybody else!
###2743 You think that Hercule Poirot is unable to find
###2745 this mysterious Mme. Middleton?
###2749 Hercule Poirot knows a way
###2753 to make Mme. Middleton
###2755 appear in our midst as if by magic.
###2760 You do not believe in magic?
###2763 Very well.
###2765 I have only to tap with my cane
###2770 on the floor three times,
###2772 thus.
###2775 -Un... -[ Tap ]
###2777 -...deux... -[ Tap ]
###2779 ...trois.
###2782 [ Tap ]
###2784 [ Dog sniffs ]
###2789 [ Door opens ]
###2791 [ Dog sniffing ]
###2808 Can we not stop this charade, Chief Inspector?
###2814 I don't know, sir. I've always enjoyed party games.
###2824 Silly dog, what's it doing?
###2825 [ Dog whimpers ]
###2831 Will somebody take it away?
###2833 [ Dog snarls, barks ]
###2837 Stop it!
###2841 -Stop it! -It's all right, Zoe.
###2847 Come on, girl. Come on, heel!
###2849 That's it. Good girl. Come.
###2852 ARCHIE: I don't know what your silly game is,
###2854 but it seems to have gone horribly wrong.
###2856 Now, leave her alone!
###2858 Zoe had nothing whatever to do with this Mrs. Middleton!
###2861 On the contrary, M. Archie,
###2863 Mme. Havering had a very close relationship
###2866 with the housekeeper, Mme. Middleton.
###2868 The odd thing about it being
###2870 was that they were never once seen together.
###2875 This temporary housekeeper had only recently been employed
###2880 for the family's stay at Hunter's Lodge.
###2883 She left little notes for the servants
###2886 and kept herself to herself.
###2890 If the mistress was at home, the housekeeper was absent.
###2894 When the housekeeper was downstairs,
###2897 the mistress was in her room.
###2899 And that is where, on the night of the murder,
###2903 after she had been interviewed by the police,
###2907 Mme. Middleton disappeared forever
###2910 from the face of the Earth.
###2921 Because it was you, Mme. Zoe Havering,
###2926 together with your husband, you planned and carried out
###2929 this murder ingenious.
###2932 Together, you plotted to rid yourselves
###2934 of your uncle that was hated
###2936 and to lay your hands, at last, on his money.
###2939 I must ask you both to come with me to the police station.
###2942 How dare you? This has gone far enough.
###2947 I do not intend to stand idly by --
###2949 Oh, shut up, Roger!
###2974 But why did she have to bury the bicycle?
###2977 How could she leave it lying around, Hastings?
###2979 If it was found and identified by M. Anstruther
###2982 as the bicycle that was stolen outside the railway station,
###2985 then it would show that the murderer
###2987 was still close to Hunter's Lodge.
###2991 Oh, hello, Mr. Poirot.
###2993 M. Anstruther.
###2994 The blackberry tea did the trick, then?
###2996 It did, indeed, monsieur.
###2997 it also stimulated the little gray cells to such an extent
###3002 that it enabled me to track down your bicycle.
###3004 ANSTRUTHER: It's a bit of a blooming mess, isn't it?
###3008 -Yes, it got buried. -Buried?
###3010 Buried.
###3012 It's all covered in mud and mold.
###3015 And I regret that I did not have the time
###3017 to clean it for you, monsieur.
###3019 ANSTRUTHER: I don't know as I could be seen
###3020 riding about on a thing like that.
###3022 That mud guard's all bent, too.
###3023 M. Anstruther,
###3027 do you or do you not want your bicycle?
###3030 Oh...Oh, just leave it there.
###3033 I'll see if the boy can do anything with it.
###3039 Is this gratitude, Hastings?
###3042 Is it for this that Hercule Poirot
###3044 exerts his talents on behalf of the world?
###3046 Do you expect gratitude? Don't make me laugh.
###3049 Now you know what a real detective feels like.
###3052 POIROT: "A real detective"?
###3057 The Chief Inspector Japp is truly most amusing,
###3059 -do you not think, Hastings? -Oh, yes.
###3060 Most amusing.
###3062 For a policeman.
