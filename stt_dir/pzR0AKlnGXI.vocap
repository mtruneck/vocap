###2 but it's the trees themselves that are most in demand all around the world.
###19 Logging is one of the greatest threats facing the world's rainforests.
###22 Yet there are a few places where its effects are far less destructive.
###33 The jungles bordering India and Burma are harvested
###36 using one of the most forest-friendly methods of all.
###39 And it involves harnessing the raw power
###43 of the mightiest creature in the jungle.
###48 This is Ramprasad - five-and-a-half tonnes of bull Asian elephant.
###61 And this is Sumir, his mahout.
###66 Before nightfall, they have to drag a two-tonne log
###71 three kilometres out of the forest.
###76 Ramprasad is the mightiest elephant in the camp,
###80 but it's still a mammoth test of brute strength and communication.
###88 Sumir steers Ramprasad with over 1 00 different commands.
###100 He can be operated in Hindi, Assamese
###103 and he even understands a little English.
###109 And Sumir's pretty fluent in elephant too.
###127 Unbelievably strong and surprisingly nimble,
###130 elephants are far superior to logging machines in this tangled terrain.
###136 And most importantly, the forest doesn't have to be completely cleared
###142 just to access a few selected trees.
###156 There's no need for expensive spare parts,
###172 and elephants run on 1 00% green fuel.
###178 But, unlike a machine, Ramprasad has a mind of his own
###186 and must be treated with respect.
###197 It's essential to break elephants in before they're put to work,
###203 but they're still wild at heart,
###204 and keeping control of such raw might is a fine balancing act
###209 of command and compassion.
###227 Sumir and Ramprasad make it to the collection site in good time
###230 and help load the trucks.
###237 Transporting logs to the sawmill
###239 is the only mechanised part of the entire process.
###244 But they're not out of the woods yet.
###256 Once again, underjungle conditions, elephants out-perform engines.
###273 Job done, time for a well-earned wash.
###281 The jungles of East India and Burma
###287 form the largest area of rainforest left in Asia
###291 and provide sanctuary for the last healthy population of Asian elephants.
###301 Ramprasad and these other elephants have lost their freedom,
###305 but this way of logging helps secure the future of their species
###311 and their home.
###315 It's through partnerships with nature
###317 that people manage to live within the jungle without destroying it.
###326 But in most areas of tropical rainforest, the picture is not so harmonious.
###334 In just 50 years, half the planet's tropical forest has been cleared.
###350 As many as 1 00 rainforest species go extinct every day...
###354 ...often before they've even been discovered.
###366 And it's not just animals and plants.
###369 We're also losing human cultures that we know almost nothing about.
###375 Even in the 2 1st century,
###382 there are still people who exist in isolation from the rest of humanity,
###386 and virtually all live in jungles.
###394 These vast, unexplored forests are the only places left on Earth
###399 where entire communities can live undetected.
###404 Brazil is thought to be home to around 70 isolated tribes,
###409 around two-thirds of the world total.
###415 Jose Carlos Meirelles works for FUNAI,
###417 a government agency that protects Brazil's indigenous people.
###422 Today he's hoping to encounter one of these uncontacted tribes.
###429 He needs to get to them before others do.
###455 Logging and mining are encroaching on these forests
###457 and there are some who want to deny
###459 that uncontacted tribes live here at all.
###468 Meirelles needs evidence.
###474 The fight to protect these people
###488 depends upon proving and publicising their existence.
###509 This is the very first aerial footage of an uncontacted community.
###533 Very little is known about their way of life or even their language,
###536 and Meirelles would rather it stays that way.
###546 He's dedicated 40 years to protecting isolated tribes from the outside world,
###551 but this isn't as simple as just leaving them alone.
###577 Using a stabilised zoom lens,
###579 it was possible to film from a kilometre away,
###582 minimising disturbance.
###584 Meirelles believes the more people are aware these tribes are here,
###590 the more effective the fight to preserve their way of life.
###632 Humans have survived here by becoming part of the forest,
###637 but it's this specialisation
###638 that leaves them so vulnerable in these changing times.
###644 These people are the guardians of a wealth of knowledge and skill
###657 that enable humans to forge a life within the natural world.
###667 And there are very few whose existence remains
###669 as intimately connected with the rainforest
###672 as the remote tribes of West Papua.
###686 The Korowai are so adapted to life in the jungle, they've taken to the trees.
###694 (SHOUTING)
###698 This clan is building a new house...
###701 (SHOUTING)
###703 ...but it will be no ordinary one.
###713 All materials must be sourced on site,
###716 and much of the cutting is still done using stone-age tools.
###725 It's an ambitious project.
###727 The plan is to build their new home in a tree 35 metres up.
###738 Just as well they've chosen an ironwood,
###741 the strongest tree in the forest.
###745 The first step is to build a ladder to its crown.
###762 These are the only tribes in the world who live in tree houses...
###766 ...and they do so for a number of reasons.
###775 It's an escape from the floods and the biting insects on the forest floor.
###781 It offers protection from enemy attack,
###783 but most of all, it's a display of theirjungle prowess.
###787 For the Korowai, the higher the house, the greater the prestige.
###806 The Korowai's skills may be exceptional,
###809 but builders are the same the world over.
###823 As one of the clan's strongest climbers,
###825 Wayo is the foreman overseeing the most dangerous jobs.
###842 Thinning the branches keeps the house from shaking apart in the wind.
###850 A fall would mean certain death,
###857 but teetering in tree-tops is second nature to the Korowai.
###872 (WHOOPING)
###881 As the house goes up, more trees come down.
###890 But they have to fall in the right direction.
