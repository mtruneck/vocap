0:7:19,64 --> 0:7:20,93
someone's stuck their
head out, someone's


205
0:7:20,93 --> 0:7:21,9
shot, whatever it was.


206
0:7:21,9 --> 0:7:24,203
In this instance, guys had gone
out to pick up water that


207
0:7:24,203 --> 0:7:25,985
had been dropped
via helicopter.


208
0:7:25,985 --> 0:7:28,52
So it was all quiet as they went
out to pick up the water.


209
0:7:28,52 --> 0:7:31,29
And then suddenly all hell
breaks loose from 360 degrees.


210
0:7:31,29 --> 0:7:35,0
And we know there are guys out
there, picking up this water.


211
0:7:35,0 --> 0:7:36,34
MALE SPEAKER: So we're
short of water.


212
0:7:36,34 --> 0:7:37,986
Short of batteries.


213
0:7:37,986 --> 0:7:39,66
Plenty of ammunition.


214
0:7:39,66 --> 0:7:42,37
And plenty of Taliban.


215
0:7:42,37 --> 0:7:43,86
So yeah.


216
0:7:43,86 --> 0:7:46,47
All in all, good going,
apart from the water.


217
0:7:46,47 --> 0:7:47,59
BEN ANDERSON: Seven guys
collapsed by the end of this


218
0:7:47,59 --> 0:7:50,68
day, and some of them were in
life-threatening conditions.


219
0:7:50,68 --> 0:7:53,0
I saw one guy actually collapse,
and I thought it was


220
0:7:53,0 --> 0:7:54,52
trauma or shell shock or
something, because I've never


221
0:7:54,52 --> 0:7:55,42
seen a guy--


222
0:7:55,42 --> 0:7:56,4
I mean, he took his top off.


223
0:7:56,4 --> 0:7:57,875
He tried to fight his friends,
who were going to


224
0:7:57,875 --> 0:7:58,52
pour water on him.


225
0:7:58,52 --> 0:8:1,94
He collapsed like a boxer who
has been knocked out.


226
0:8:1,94 --> 0:8:4,1
I didn't realize that heat
exhaustion can be that bad.


227
0:8:4,1 --> 0:8:6,12
And plus, these guys are
soldiers, so they're going to


228
0:8:6,12 --> 0:8:7,41
deny it to the last minute.


229
0:8:7,41 --> 0:8:9,26
They're going to pretend they're
OK, and struggle on


230
0:8:9,26 --> 0:8:10,88
through until the very
last minute, when


231
0:8:10,88 --> 0:8:12,47
it's almost too late.


232
0:8:12,47 --> 0:8:14,15
Despite what's happened, the
day is far from over.


233
0:8:14,15 --> 0:8:16,23
MALE SPEAKER: Oh,
far from over.


234
0:8:16,23 --> 0:8:17,5
This is just the beginning.


235
0:8:17,5 --> 0:8:20,732
This is just the beginning
of a very busy day.


236
0:8:20,732 --> 0:8:23,8
Probably a couple of days,
if not a week.


237
0:8:23,8 --> 0:8:24,73
BEN ANDERSON: Eventually the
Taliban withdrew, and we just


238
0:8:24,73 --> 0:8:25,43
walked away.


239
0:8:25,43 --> 0:8:26,62
I don't know if they ran out
of ammunition or something.


240
0:8:26,62 --> 0:8:29,32
They packed up and left,
and it stayed quiet.


241
0:8:29,32 --> 0:8:32,27
And within a very short time of
leaving that compound, we


242
0:8:32,27 --> 0:8:35,19
heard over the radios that the
Taliban had retaken all of


243
0:8:35,19 --> 0:8:36,559
those buildings that had
been fought for.


244
0:8:36,559 --> 0:8:45,71



245
0:8:45,71 --> 0:8:49,98
MALE SPEAKER: I believe we're
going to go north, go firm,


246
0:8:49,98 --> 0:8:51,858
put a defensive position in.


247
0:8:51,858 --> 0:8:54,74
And then we'll have a nice
quiet night in the valley


248
0:8:54,74 --> 0:8:56,22
tonight, by the look of it.


249
0:8:56,22 --> 0:8:57,41
Not.


250
0:8:57,41 --> 0:8:59,61
BEN ANDERSON: If this small area
of the valley takes this


251
0:8:59,61 --> 0:9:3,26
much of a fight to clear, how
much is the whole province


252
0:9:3,26 --> 0:9:3,48
going to take?


253
0:9:3,48 --> 0:9:5,54
MALE SPEAKER: Well, the country
being like it is-- and


254
0:9:5,54 --> 0:9:7,89
it's classic hit-and-run
country.


255
0:9:7,89 --> 0:9:10,78
It's like Normandy, hedgerows,
ditches,


256
0:9:10,78 --> 0:9:13,15
plowed fields, compounds.


257
0:9:13,15 --> 0:9:15,19
And these guys, they've got all
the time in the world to


258
0:9:15,19 --> 0:9:17,41
set up what they want to set up,
and where they want to be.


259
0:9:17,41 --> 0:9:19,96
Whereas we've got to advance
into them to flush them out.


260
0:9:19,96 --> 0:9:21,985
So the whole province?


261
0:9:21,985 --> 0:9:25,19
Oh, I don't get paid enough
to tell you that one.


262
0:9:25,19 --> 0:9:26,4
I don't know.


263
0:9:26,4 --> 0:9:27,207
I'm not going to guess.


264
0:9:27,207 --> 0:9:28,52
BEN ANDERSON: How old are you?


265
0:9:28,52 --> 0:9:30,53
MALE SPEAKER: 41 years old.


266
0:9:30,53 --> 0:9:32,823
And I was supposed to leave
the army this year.


267
0:9:32,823 --> 0:9:37,43
And I was graciously offered two
more years, and I took it.


268
0:9:37,43 --> 0:9:39,3
BEN ANDERSON: Is this
your last tour?


269
0:9:39,3 --> 0:9:40,86
MALE SPEAKER: Probably
yes, he says.


270
0:9:40,86 --> 0:9:44,32
But I did say that last year in
Iraq, that that was going


271
0:9:44,32 --> 0:9:45,675
to be my last tour.


272
0:9:45,675 --> 0:9:47,3
And obviously it's not,
so we'll see.


273
0:9:47,3 --> 0:9:48,33
We'll see what happens.


274
0:9:48,33 --> 0:9:50,63
MALE SPEAKER: Probably the
biggest I've had in my career


275
0:9:50,63 --> 0:9:54,7
since I've been in, mate,
in terms of contacts.


276
0:9:54,7 --> 0:9:57,91
I've been going since
0300 this morning.


277
0:9:57,91 --> 0:10:2,1
It's now 10 past 4:00 in the
afternoon, 1610 hours.


278
0:10:2,1 --> 0:10:6,45
So it's been quite a long day.


279
0:10:6,45 --> 0:10:7,145
It's not over yet.


280
0:10:7,145 --> 0:10:9,91
We've still got to move off
to our next location, and


281
0:10:9,91 --> 0:10:12,45
meet up with WFR.


282
0:10:12,45 --> 0:10:14,12
And then we'll see how
we get from there.


283
0:10:14,12 --> 0:10:15,75
But the boys have worked their
nuts off, as usual.


284
0:10:15,75 --> 0:10:17,2
So have the ANA.


285
0:10:17,2 --> 0:10:19,7
Everyone's worked really hard.


286
0:10:19,7 --> 0:10:21,8
BEN ANDERSON: So when he says,
that's the most intense day


287
0:10:21,8 --> 0:10:24,14
I've ever had as a soldier,
he's done tours of Iraq,


288
0:10:24,14 --> 0:10:28,31
Bosnia, Kosovo, Northern
Ireland, Afghanistan.


289
0:10:28,31 --> 0:10:30,43
That's not said lightly
when he says that.


290
0:10:30,43 --> 0:10:30,92
SHANE SMITH: Right.


291
0:10:30,92 --> 0:10:33,26
So Afghanistan has the
fiercest fighting in


292
0:10:33,26 --> 0:10:34,39
the world right now.


293
0:10:34,39 --> 0:10:34,62
BEN ANDERSON: Yeah.


294
0:10:34,62 --> 0:10:36,59
I mean, the historians and
these guys, they're all


295
0:10:36,59 --> 0:10:40,38
saying, the most ferocious
fighting since the Korean War.


296
0:10:40,38 --> 0:10:40,99
MALE SPEAKER: Lucky today.


297
0:10:40,99 --> 0:10:43,282
We seemed to be near cover every
time it come, didn't we?


298
0:10:43,282 --> 0:10:45,631
We're lucky.


299
0:10:45,631 --> 0:10:47,886
I'm surprised no one's
a casualty today.


300
0:10:47,886 --> 0:10:48,89
BEN ANDERSON: Is it manpower?


301
0:10:48,89 --> 0:10:49,505
The reason you can't--


302
0:10:49,505 --> 0:10:50,33
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah,
it's manpower.


303
0:10:50,33 --> 0:10:51,9
We haven't got the manpower.


304
0:10:51,9 --> 0:10:53,16
There's not enough
people out here.


305
0:10:53,16 --> 0:10:54,68
Now, they're out to fight.


306
0:10:54,68 --> 0:10:56,655
And it's very rare that
you see them.


307
0:10:56,655 --> 0:10:59,2
But most people here ain't
even seen a Taliban yet.


308
0:10:59,2 --> 0:11:1,32
SHANE SMITH: So they can fight
the Taliban all day for 12


309
0:11:1,32 --> 0:11:3,25
hours, and they'll have
never have seen them.


310
0:11:3,25 --> 0:11:4,61
BEN ANDERSON: You might
see a bit of movement.


311
0:11:4,61 --> 0:11:6,6
You might see a flash
of light from where


312
0:11:6,6 --> 0:11:7,21
they're firing from.


313
0:11:7,21 --> 0:11:8,3
That's it.


314
0:11:8,3 --> 0:11:10,92
And they probably have seen lots
of Taliban when they're


315
0:11:10,92 --> 0:11:11,84
not fighting.


316
0:11:11,84 --> 0:11:12,55
SHANE SMITH: They just
don't know it.


317
0:11:12,55 --> 0:11:13,17
BEN ANDERSON: They're in the
villages and the towns.


318
0:11:13,17 --> 0:11:14,37
But how do you know?


319
0:11:14,37 --> 0:11:15,49
MALE SPEAKER: As soon as it
starts getting a bit rough,


320
0:11:15,49 --> 0:11:17,46
and it looks they're going to
get it, they'll fucking pick a


321
0:11:17,46 --> 0:11:20,84
pitchfork up, and they're
Farmer Joe for the day.


322
0:11:20,84 --> 0:11:22,67
If someone's coming towards
me on the same path,


323
0:11:22,67 --> 0:11:24,102
I'll cross the path.


324
0:11:24,102 --> 0:11:26,34
I don't want them to get
nowhere near me.


325
0:11:26,34 --> 0:11:28,95
I want to go home.


326
0:11:28,95 --> 0:11:30,83
They're the kind of people that
believe when they die,


327
0:11:30,83 --> 0:11:34,94
they're going to wake
up with 27 virgins.


328
0:11:34,94 --> 0:11:36,763
So how can you fight against
someone like that, who doesn't


329
0:11:36,763 --> 0:11:38,456
give a shit?


330
0:11:38,456 --> 0:11:39,722
It's like as soon as
I die, I'll be


331
0:11:39,722 --> 0:11:40,15
going back to Tottenham.


332
0:11:40,15 --> 0:11:42,89
I'll fucking run
at the bullets.


333
0:11:42,89 --> 0:11:44,4
BEN ANDERSON: And you regularly
see guys that are


334
0:11:44,4 --> 0:11:44,88
just dumbfounded.


335
0:11:44,88 --> 0:11:46,78
Like, how can you fight
against someone


336
0:11:46,78 --> 0:11:48,16
who wants to die?


337
0:11:48,16 --> 0:11:50,78
Who thinks that dying is an end,
dying is a route to some


338
0:11:50,78 --> 0:11:52,45
kind of paradise?


339
0:11:52,45 --> 0:11:53,81
SHANE SMITH: So who is going
to win that fight?


340
0:11:53,81 --> 0:11:55,3
BEN ANDERSON: People regularly
talk about how the Americans


341
0:11:55,3 --> 0:11:57,13
and British always beat
the Taliban when they


342
0:11:57,13 --> 0:11:58,24
meet them in a fight.


343
0:11:58,24 --> 0:12:1,6
That doesn't mean the Taliban
are ever going to give up.


344
0:12:1,6 --> 0:12:4,2
That's the follow-up point that
most people seem to miss.


345
0:12:4,2 --> 0:12:4,65
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, we'll
come straight


346
0:12:4,65 --> 0:12:5,39
back today or tomorrow.


347
0:12:5,39 --> 0:12:7,525
But the thing is, because we've
left it, we'll have to


348
0:12:7,525 --> 0:12:8,31
fucking start again.


349
0:12:8,31 --> 0:12:10,696
So that is just pointless,
isn't it?


350
0:12:10,696 --> 0:12:13,29
I mean, we don't know what
we're doing now.


351
0:12:13,29 --> 0:12:16,65
That's the hardest
bit, not knowing.


352
0:12:16,65 --> 0:12:17,36
SHANE SMITH: You
went in there.


353
0:12:17,36 --> 0:12:18,1
You fought all day.


354
0:12:18,1 --> 0:12:19,34
You got surrounded.


355
0:12:19,34 --> 0:12:21,185
People are dropping like flies
from heat exhaustion.


356
0:12:21,185 --> 0:12:24,21
You nearly got bombed by your
own guys three times.


357
0:12:24,21 --> 0:12:26,91
And then you had to leave, so
the Taliban just went in.


358
0:12:26,91 --> 0:12:27,31
BEN ANDERSON: Yeah.


359
0:12:27,31 --> 0:12:29,65
He said we haven't got the
manpower to hold on to land.


360
0:12:29,65 --> 0:12:31,105
And it's the same thing with
the border with Pakistan.


361
0:12:31,105 --> 0:12:34,3
They just haven't got the
manpower to either hold on to


362
0:12:34,3 --> 0:12:35,54
land or patrol borders
properly.


363
0:12:35,54 --> 0:12:37,39
SHANE SMITH: So it's
all for nothing.


364
0:12:37,39 --> 0:12:39,585
BEN ANDERSON: With existing
levels of troops, yeah.


365
0:12:39,585 --> 0:12:43,77



366
0:12:43,77 --> 0:12:46,39
MALE SPEAKER: I'd say yesterday
was probably the


367
0:12:46,39 --> 0:12:50,98
hardest day I've had in
17 years' service.


368
0:12:50,98 --> 0:12:55,12
And I think all of the others
who fought in it yesterday


369
0:12:55,12 --> 0:12:57,42
would probably agree.


370
0:12:57,42 --> 0:13:2,97
It was eight hours of
unrelenting combat against a


371
0:13:2,97 --> 0:13:10,34
canny, wily, determined enemy,
who was prepared to


372
0:13:10,34 --> 0:13:11,88
fight to the death.


373
0:13:11,88 --> 0:13:16,23
It's extremely difficult in
the Green Zone to maneuver


374
0:13:16,23 --> 0:13:17,99
your forces.


375
0:13:17,99 --> 0:13:20,47
BEN ANDERSON: Is there a danger
that by flattening


376
0:13:20,47 --> 0:13:21,9
compounds--


377
0:13:21,9 --> 0:13:23,89
and obviously civilians are
going to get caught up in the


378
0:13:23,89 --> 0:13:25,54
compounds from time to time--


379
0:13:25,54 --> 0:13:27,23
that you could lose
the support of the


380
0:13:27,23 --> 0:13:28,9
population here entirely?


381
0:13:28,9 --> 0:13:32,43
That they could either become
indifferent to you being here,


382
0:13:32,43 --> 0:13:36,35
or worse, supporters and
helpers of the Taliban?


383
0:13:36,35 --> 0:13:39,69
MALE SPEAKER: It's
a fine line.


384
0:13:39,69 --> 0:13:43,77
I think if we were completely
indiscriminate in our fires,


385
0:13:43,77 --> 0:13:46,83
then yes, we could lose
support quite quickly.


386
0:13:46,83 --> 0:13:50,76
As it happens, yesterday there
was an attack aviation strike


387
0:13:50,76 --> 0:13:57,23
on a compound which had
civilians and my men in it.


388
0:13:57,23 --> 0:14:2,31
I was fortunate that none
of them were injured.


389
0:14:2,31 --> 0:14:5,59
It was me.


390
0:14:5,59 --> 0:14:9,66
I directed that attack.


391
0:14:9,66 --> 0:14:12,1
I gave clearance
for it to fire.


392
0:14:12,1 --> 0:14:16,35
And the responsibility for
it lies on my shoulders.


393
0:14:16,35 --> 0:14:20,93
In this instance, I'm extremely
lucky that there


394
0:14:20,93 --> 0:14:24,795
were no casualties, either
friendly or civilian.


395
0:14:24,795 --> 0:14:27,52
SHANE SMITH: What do you think
is happening in Afghanistan?


396
0:14:27,52 --> 0:14:28,98
BEN ANDERSON: I think
that is happening on


397
0:14:28,98 --> 0:14:30,69
a much wider scale.


398
0:14:30,69 --> 0:14:33,52
There's no evidence that the
Taliban are even thinking


399
0:14:33,52 --> 0:14:35,24
about giving up.


400
0:14:35,24 --> 0:14:38,4
There's no evidence that a
military solution is possible.


401
0:14:38,4 --> 0:14:40,625
And there's no evidence that the
Brits or the Americans or


402
0:14:40,625 --> 0:14:43,28
anyone can control anything
apart from these isolated


403
0:14:43,28 --> 0:14:44,3
bases and towns.


404
0:14:44,3 --> 0:14:46,29
So the Taliban have complete
free rein, especially over the


405
0:14:46,29 --> 0:14:47,62
south of Afghanistan.


406
0:14:47,62 --> 0:14:49,81
SHANE SMITH: So we went in
to kick the Taliban out.


407
0:14:49,81 --> 0:14:51,81
The Taliban are getting
stronger and stronger.


408
0:14:51,81 --> 0:14:54,125
There's more drugs coming
out than ever before.


409
0:14:54,125 --> 0:14:55,53
Why are we there?


410
0:14:55,53 --> 0:14:58,53
BEN ANDERSON: The most
discouraging thing I've seen


411
0:14:58,53 --> 0:15:0,73
or heard from Afghanistan
recently is when I was there,


412
0:15:0,73 --> 0:15:3,15
one town was left that was under
control of the Taliban.


413
0:15:3,15 --> 0:15:5,35
That was taken just
after I left.


414
0:15:5,35 --> 0:15:8,9
They put in charge a
guy who's Taliban.


415
0:15:8,9 --> 0:15:10,17
He soon described himself
as good Taliban.


416
0:15:10,17 --> 0:15:12,13
Yeah, that makes you think, why
have we been fighting and


417
0:15:12,13 --> 0:15:14,71
losing people for six years,
when we could have done


418
0:15:14,71 --> 0:15:15,97
exactly the same deal
that we've done


419
0:15:15,97 --> 0:15:18,43
today, six years ago?
