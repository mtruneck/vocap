SHANE SMITH: War makes fucked
up movies, and that is a


10
0:1:22,23 --> 0:1:23,39
fucked up movie.


11
0:1:23,39 --> 0:1:25,8
It's called "Divine
Intervention." It's part of a


12
0:1:25,8 --> 0:1:28,175
new wave of Lebanese cinema
that's coming out of the


13
0:1:28,175 --> 0:1:30,61
violence and the craziness and
the terror that's been going


14
0:1:30,61 --> 0:1:36,9
on there for the
past 40 years.


15
0:1:36,9 --> 0:1:38,27
Now there are a lot of different
political factions


16
0:1:38,27 --> 0:1:40,28
within Lebanon, but we're going
to be concentrating on


17
0:1:40,28 --> 0:1:42,43
the Palestinians, who
are refugees.


18
0:1:42,43 --> 0:1:43,53
They are people without
a state.


19
0:1:43,53 --> 0:1:46,792
And film has become the most
important medium for them to


20
0:1:46,792 --> 0:1:50,22
get their message across.


21
0:1:50,22 --> 0:1:52,85
50 or 60 years ago,
Beirut was much


22
0:1:52,85 --> 0:1:54,4
different than it is today.


23
0:1:54,4 --> 0:1:56,43
It was known as the Paris
of the Middle East.


24
0:1:56,43 --> 0:1:58,28
It was the cultural center
of the region.


25
0:1:58,28 --> 0:2:1,255
It was the artistic hub.


26
0:2:1,255 --> 0:2:3,72
But at the same time, this
part of the world was


27
0:2:3,72 --> 0:2:5,89
radically altered with
the establishment


28
0:2:5,89 --> 0:2:9,53
of Israel in 1948.


29
0:2:9,53 --> 0:2:12,75
The creation of Israel and the
ensuing war caused the


30
0:2:12,75 --> 0:2:15,8
displacement of the Palestinian
people into many


31
0:2:15,8 --> 0:2:16,44
neighboring Arab countries.


32
0:2:16,44 --> 0:2:20,15
But a lot of them settled in
Lebanon in temporary camps and


33
0:2:20,15 --> 0:2:22,37
thought that they would soon be
returning to their homes.


34
0:2:22,37 --> 0:2:24,0
But they're still there today.


35
0:2:24,0 --> 0:2:27,14
Three generations later, they
still don't have a homeland.


36
0:2:27,14 --> 0:2:28,81
They are still refugees.


37
0:2:28,81 --> 0:2:30,15
They don't have passports.


38
0:2:30,15 --> 0:2:31,37
They can't work.


39
0:2:31,37 --> 0:2:35,0
And they're still living
in the same camps.


40
0:2:35,0 --> 0:2:38,355
Today Israel believes that the
Palestinian refugee camps are


41
0:2:38,355 --> 0:2:41,23
a breeding ground for terrorists
and that militant


42
0:2:41,23 --> 0:2:44,925
groups like the Hezbollah hide
their weapons within their


43
0:2:44,925 --> 0:2:46,175
communities.


44
0:2:46,175 --> 0:2:48,49



45
0:2:48,49 --> 0:2:52,57
In 2006, Israel bombed Lebanon
for a month in retaliation for


46
0:2:52,57 --> 0:2:54,91
Hezbollah's kidnapping of
two of their soldiers.


47
0:2:54,91 --> 0:3:0,64



48
0:3:0,64 --> 0:3:3,5
Some of what happened in Lebanon
during the conflict


49
0:3:3,5 --> 0:3:4,93
was documented by civilians.


50
0:3:4,93 --> 0:3:8,11
In fact, the footage you're
watching now is from a DVD


51

streets of Beirut.

SHANE SMITH: Instead of
succumbing to hatred and


55
0:3:45,2 --> 0:3:47,46
violence, some young
Palestinians have turned to


56
0:3:47,46 --> 0:3:51,66
film making as both a creative
and a political outlet.


57

And we're seeing fiction, we're
seeing documentary, as

SHANE SMITH: These films are
happening with little to no


77
0:4:50,52 --> 0:4:54,26
funding, basic resources, but
against all odds a small group


78
0:4:54,26 --> 0:4:58,59
of Palestinian filmmakers
is emerging.


79
0:4:58,59 --> 0:5:1,42
Our first contact with
Palestinian filmmakers was


80
0:5:1,42 --> 0:5:2,38
very personal.


81
0:5:2,38 --> 0:5:5,223
We had gone to Beirut to shoot
"The Vice Guide to Travel." It


82
0:5:5,223 --> 0:5:7,45
was a story about a skate
park that was


83
0:5:7,45 --> 0:5:9,13
sponsored by the Hezbollah.


84
0:5:9,13 --> 0:5:11,87
And while we were there, we met
a Palestinian Boy Scout


85
0:5:11,87 --> 0:5:13,35
leader named Ahmad.


86
0:5:13,35 --> 0:5:18,18
And Ahmad lived in the Bourj
al-Barajneh camp in Beirut.


87
0:5:18,18 --> 0:5:21,53
Eddie, our producer, went
to Ahmad's house


88
0:5:21,53 --> 0:5:22,57
to interview him.


89
0:5:22,57 --> 0:5:25,14
And he found out that his dream


90
0:5:25,14 --> 0:5:26,39
was to become a filmmaker.


91
0:5:26,39 --> 0:5:48,36



92
0:5:48,36 --> 0:5:51,76
EDDIE: So I wanted to stop here
because of that poster.


93
0:5:51,76 --> 0:5:53,62

that they painted?

camps, which are incredibly


119
0:7:59,66 --> 0:8:0,73
depressing.


120
0:8:0,73 --> 0:8:4,13
And the thought that Ahmad
wanted to be a filmmaker, and


121
0:8:4,13 --> 0:8:6,76
that we had everything at our
disposal to help him with


122
0:8:6,76 --> 0:8:9,99
that, after spending time with
him and opening up his life to


123
0:8:9,99 --> 0:8:12,5
us, we decided that we
would surprise him.


124
0:8:12,5 --> 0:8:15,332
And we gave him one
of our cameras.


125
0:8:15,332 --> 0:8:19,51

so difficult to get like
