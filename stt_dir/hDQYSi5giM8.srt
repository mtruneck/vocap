JEFF KROL>> Hi, my name is Jeff Kroll and
I'm responsible for the supply chain and quality


2
0:0:4,839 --> 0:0:10,389
systems groups at McDonald's Restaurants of
Canada. We're here in Southern Alberta to


3
0:0:10,389 --> 0:0:16,43
show you what a farm looks like, and how they
operate and the conditions that the animals


4
0:0:16,43 --> 0:0:22,47
are under. And I am here with Bob lowe who
is the co-owner of Lowe Ranch. And Bob our


5
0:0:22,47 --> 0:0:29,539
first questions is from Gee L. from kingston,
ON. "Maybe you could post a picture of these


6
0:0:29,539 --> 0:0:34,41
happy 'Family farms' in which you say your
animals are raised with the best care?"


7
0:0:34,41 --> 0:0:40,75
BOB LOWE>> Our farm is 3 generations- my father,
my brother, myself, my nephew, my son. We


8
0:0:40,75 --> 0:0:46,199
just raise cattle the way, the way they're
supposed to be raised, I guess. If you're


9
0:0:46,199 --> 0:0:52,17
a cow, it's pretty idyllic. The mother cows
are on pasture year round. The calves, after


10
0:0:52,17 --> 0:0:53,739
their weened, will go into the feedlot.


11
0:0:53,739 --> 0:0:57,309
JEFF KROL>> And what do they feed on when
they are here?


12
0:0:57,309 --> 0:0:59,93
BOB Lowe: Grass- just grass.


13
0:0:59,93 --> 0:1:2,789
JEFF KROL>> And how big is this area we are
looking at?


14
0:1:2,789 --> 0:1:7,9
BOB LOWE>> Well, this particular field is
320 acres. We've got pastures in the mountains


15
0:1:7,9 --> 0:1:8,58
that are 24,000 acres.


16
0:1:8,58 --> 0:1:11,41
JEFF KROLL>> Wow. That's a lot of pasture


17
0:1:11,41 --> 0:1:13,27
BOB LOWE>> Yeah. hahaha


18
0:1:13,27 --> 0:1:18,22
JEFF KROL>> You mentioned a feedlot. Would
we be able to actually go out and see a feedlot?


19
0:1:18,22 --> 0:1:22,3
BOB LOWE>> We can do that. We have a feedlot
as a part of our operation.


20
0:1:22,3 --> 0:1:23,46
JEFF KROL>> Fantastic.


21
0:1:23,46 --> 0:1:28,53
BOB LOWE>> As you can see, that's my house
over there. It's 200 yards from the feedlot.


22
0:1:28,53 --> 0:1:33,56
I can walk to work. My kids, when they were
little, could come over and see me anytime.


23
0:1:33,56 --> 0:1:39,18
It's important to me that the consumers are
told the truth about where their food comes


24
0:1:39,18 --> 0:1:44,52
from. We aren't trying to gloss anything.
What we do- we are proud of what we do. WE,


25
0:1:44,52 --> 0:1:48,63
what we produce in this feedlot and I wouldn't
try to sell it to somebody else if I wouldn't


26
0:1:48,63 --> 0:1:49,36
eat it myself.


27
0:1:49,36 --> 0:1:51,64
JEFF KROL>> So Bob, where are we now?


28
0:1:51,64 --> 0:1:56,92
BOB LOWE>>Right now we're at the feedlot,
it's another division of our farm. This is


29
0:1:56,92 --> 0:1:59,34
where the calves will come after their weened.


30
0:1:59,34 --> 0:2:3,7
JEEF KROL>> And would this be the average
size for a feedlot?


31
0:2:3,7 --> 0:2:7,78
BOB LOWE>> We're 4000 head capacity. We're
probably considered a medium sized feedlot


32
0:2:7,78 --> 0:2:8,36
in Alberta.


33
0:2:8,36 --> 0:2:10,88
JEFF KROL>> How many months will they actually
be here.


34
0:2:10,88 --> 0:2:15,5
BOB LOWE>> The ones that are going back into
the breeding herd will be here about 5 months.


35
0:2:15,5 --> 0:2:18,56
The ones that will go into the food chain
will be here about 8 months.


36
0:2:18,56 --> 0:2:24,5
JEFF KROL>> Our next question is from Squid
N. "What do you feed your animals?". So Bob,


37
0:2:24,5 --> 0:2:26,24
what is actually in the feed?


38
0:2:26,24 --> 0:2:32,3
BOB LOWE>> We feed a mixture of straw, silage,
grain and a mineral pack. The straw is this.


39
0:2:32,3 --> 0:2:38,6
As you can see it's from a mature plant. This
is barley straw. Silage is just an immature


40
0:2:38,6 --> 0:2:42,49
plant. It is green. The nutrient content is
spread through the whole plant instead of


41
0:2:42,49 --> 0:2:47,6
just in the seed head. The barley seed from
the mature plant looks like this. This is


42
0:2:47,6 --> 0:2:52,11
the milled barley. That just basically means
it's crushed. The reason we do it is to improve


43
0:2:52,11 --> 0:2:58,26
the digestion. We do feed analysis on all
our feed and where it's lacking in vitamins


44
0:2:58,26 --> 0:3:4,28
and minerals we get custom formulated mineral
pack. This is a sample of the mixed ration


45
0:3:4,28 --> 0:3:9,19
that comes out of the feed truck. The silage
the straw, you can see some grain kernels


46
0:3:9,19 --> 0:3:13,88
in there. That's just, that's what the cattle
get to eat.


47
0:3:13,88 --> 0:3:20,25
JEFF KROL>> Our next question is from Emily.
"Does the animal feed contain any antibiotics?".


48
0:3:20,25 --> 0:3:25,79
I'm here with Calvin Booker, who is a Vetrinarian
in Souther Alberta and actually Bob's local


49
0:3:25,79 --> 0:3:31,1
Vertinarian. And Calvin and Bob I'm hoping
we can answer Emily's questions.


50
0:3:31,1 --> 0:3:36,64
CALVIN BOOKER>>So, Jeff some of the feed we
feed animals, Cadilac seed, does contain antibiotics.


51
0:3:36,64 --> 0:3:41,459
Depends on what stage of the production cycle
the animals are in and what particular diseases


52
0:3:41,459 --> 0:3:45,58
they might be susceptible to at that point
in the production cycle. We would look to


53
0:3:45,58 --> 0:3:52,45
on of the licensed anti-microbial products
in Canada to try and prevent and control diseases


54
0:3:52,45 --> 0:3:57,77
that might occur in the cattle population.
Cattle are- in some ways- a lot like people.


55
0:3:57,77 --> 0:4:2,209
They get sick from a lot of different diseases.
Some of those are infectious diseases like


56
0:4:2,209 --> 0:4:7,45
the common cold and others might be metabolic
disturbances or digestive disease like when


57
0:4:7,45 --> 0:4:13,5
we have an upset stomach. For the animal health
products that we use in Canada, their approved


58
0:4:13,5 --> 0:4:18,19
and regulated as to how we can use those by
the Canadian Food Inspection Agency or the


59
0:4:18,19 --> 0:6:18,19
Vetrianary Drugs Directorate Division of Health
Canada. Included in that would be
