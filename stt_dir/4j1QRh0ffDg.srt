Hi guys, just having a little test cook today.
We're doing a lovely dish from Bali, Indonesia.


2
0:0:12,29 --> 0:0:19,4
Nasi Goreng. Classic dish from around the
world in the sense that you're using up leftovers.


3
0:0:19,4 --> 0:0:23,8
So, back in the days when there weren't refrigerators
and stuff like that. So a nice way of adding


4
0:0:23,8 --> 0:0:30,21
value, flavour and so just like dry fried
rice with fragrant things like shallots, ginger,


5
0:0:30,21 --> 0:0:37,0
chilli, tamarind and I'm sure many, many other
things, meat, fish, prawns. This is the vegetarian


6
0:0:37,0 --> 0:0:43,35
one so we're loving a little bit of the broccoli
and little edamames and stuff like that. And


7
0:0:43,35 --> 0:0:49,23
like a little local ketchup. So it's a nice,
like stir-fried rice, delicious, little fried


8
0:0:49,23 --> 0:0:56,28
egg on top and just, like chilli. It's basically
a breakfast/brunch dish and I love it. It's


9
0:0:56,28 --> 0:1:0,14
really good so we're just messing around with
different textures, different temperatures,


10
0:1:0,14 --> 0:1:4,89
different mixes and then we're gonna do a
little recipe and it's gonna be lovely!


11
0:1:4,89 --> 0:1:15,749
Anyway, ignore the beard, I haven't shaved
for a week. I'm preparing myself for a long


12
0:1:15,749 --> 0:1:23,63
voyage up a mountain. If you like the beard,
subscribe. If you don't like the beard, comment.


13
0:1:23,63 --> 0:1:30,71
But keep the comments clean because I've got
feelings. I am human. Contrary to public opinion,


14
0:1:30,71 --> 0:1:41,52
I am actually just like you. I've got feelings,
I get lonely. Sometimes I get vulnerable.


15
0:1:41,52 --> 0:3:41,52
So when bad things are said, it hurts. There!
Right there!
