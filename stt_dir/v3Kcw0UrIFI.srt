1
0:0:6,31 --> 0:0:8,6
If things don't work out on this planet...


2
0:0:8,6 --> 0:0:31,699
Or if our itch to explore becomes unbearable
at some point in the future...


3
0:0:31,699 --> 0:0:37,2
Astronomers have recently found out what kind
of galactic real estate might be available


4
0:0:37,2 --> 0:0:42,25
to us.


5
0:0:42,25 --> 0:0:49,44
We'll have to develop advanced transport to
land there, 20 light years away.... But that's


6
0:0:49,44 --> 0:0:50,67
for later.


7
0:0:50,67 --> 0:0:58,35
The question right now: is it worth the trip?
The destination is a star that you can't see


8
0:0:58,35 --> 0:1:8,65
with your naked eye, in the southern constellation
Libra, called Gliese 581.


9
0:1:8,65 --> 0:1:14,1
Identified over 40 years ago by the German
astronomer Wilhelm Gliese, it's a red dwarf


10
0:1:14,1 --> 0:1:23,399
with 31% of the Sun's mass... and only 1.3%
of its luminosity.


11
0:1:23,399 --> 0:1:30,869
Until recently, the so-called M Stars like
Gliese 581 flew below the radar of planet


12
0:1:30,869 --> 0:1:31,39
hunters.


13
0:1:31,39 --> 0:1:37,229
They give off so little energy that a planet
would have to orbit dangerously close just


14
0:1:37,229 --> 0:1:42,579
to get enough heat.


15
0:1:42,579 --> 0:1:48,719
Now, these unlikely realms are beginning to
show some promise... as their dim light yields


16
0:1:48,719 --> 0:1:50,9
to precision technologies...


17
0:1:50,9 --> 0:1:57,92
...as well as supercomputers... honed in the
battle to understand global changes on this


18
0:1:57,92 --> 0:2:3,35
planet... Earth.


19
0:2:3,35 --> 0:2:6,79
Will we now begin to detect signs of alien
life?


20
0:2:6,79 --> 0:2:14,819
Or will these worlds, and the galaxy itself,
turn out to be lifeless... and Earth, just


21
0:2:14,819 --> 0:2:18,89
a beautiful, lonely aberration?


22
0:2:18,89 --> 0:2:25,86
To some, like astronomer and author Carl Sagan,
the sheer number and diversity of stars makes


23
0:2:25,86 --> 0:2:31,7
it, as he said, "far more likely that the
universe is brimming over with life."


24
0:2:31,7 --> 0:2:39,48
This so-called "many worlds" view can be traced
back to ancient observers... in China, India,


25
0:2:39,48 --> 0:2:47,45
Greece and Egypt. The Qur'an, the Talmud,
and many Hindu texts all imagined a universe


26
0:2:47,45 --> 0:2:50,269
full of living beings.


27
0:2:50,269 --> 0:2:55,61
In the 16th Century, this view got a boost
from astronomer and mathematician Nikolas


28
0:2:55,61 --> 0:3:2,6
Copernicus... who came to believe that Earth
is not the center of the universe, but revolves


29
0:3:2,6 --> 0:3:4,379
around the Sun.


30
0:3:4,379 --> 0:3:10,87
Seven decades after Copernicus, Galileo Galilei
used his newly developed telescope to show


31
0:3:10,87 --> 0:3:16,59
that our Sun was just one among countless
other stars in the universe.


32
0:3:16,59 --> 0:3:23,849
By the modern era, the "many worlds" view
held sway in scientific circles. A variety


33
0:3:23,849 --> 0:3:29,64
of thinkers considered what and who inhabited
worlds beyond our own.


34
0:3:29,64 --> 0:3:37,739
From Martians desperate to get off their planet...
to alien invaders intent on launching pre-emptive


35
0:3:37,739 --> 0:3:50,3
strikes against ours... or simple life forms
on an evolutionary track to complexity.


36
0:3:50,3 --> 0:3:54,17
But other thinkers have been struck by a different
view.


37
0:3:54,17 --> 0:4:1,15
The Greek philosophers Aristotle and Ptolemy
believed that humans and Earth are unique.


38
0:4:1,15 --> 0:4:9,769
With the spread of Christianity, this Ptolemaic
system became widely accepted.


39
0:4:9,769 --> 0:4:16,65
The latest variation on this theme is what's
called the "Rare Earth" hypothesis. It holds


40
0:4:16,65 --> 0:4:21,85
that Earth and sophisticated life were the
result of fortuitous circumstances that may


41
0:4:21,85 --> 0:4:27,699
not be easy to find again in our galaxy.


42
0:4:27,699 --> 0:4:33,3
Does the current search for planets shed light
on this debate... sending it in one direction


43
0:4:33,3 --> 0:4:34,93
or the other?


44
0:4:34,93 --> 0:4:41,46
So far, our only good reference for recognizing
an Earth-like planet is... Earth.


45
0:4:41,46 --> 0:4:50,3
It does have some fortuitous characteristics...
it's dense, it's rocky - with a complex make-up


46
0:4:50,3 --> 0:5:2,9
of minerals and organic compounds - and it
has lots and lots of water.


47
0:5:2,9 --> 0:5:7,8
It's also got a nearly circular orbit around
the Sun, at a distance that allows liquid


48
0:5:7,8 --> 0:5:17,61
water to flow... not too close and not too
far away, in the so-called "Habitable Zone."


49
0:5:17,61 --> 0:5:22,18
That's defined as the range of distance from
a parent star that a planet would need to


50
0:5:22,18 --> 0:5:28,22
maintain surface temperatures between the
freezing and boiling points of water.


51
0:5:28,22 --> 0:5:33,91
Of course, that depends on the size of the
planet, the make-up of its atmosphere, and


52
0:5:33,91 --> 0:5:37,949
a host of other factors.


53
0:5:37,949 --> 0:5:45,39
And whether the parent star is large; medium
like the Sun; or small.


54
0:5:45,39 --> 0:5:53,8
Some scientists also believe we live in a
"Galactic Habitable Zone." We're close enough


55
0:5:53,8 --> 0:5:57,9
to the galactic center to be infused with
heavy elements generated by countless stellar


56
0:5:57,9 --> 0:5:59,639
explosions over the eons...


57
0:5:59,639 --> 0:6:7,97
But far enough away from deadly gamma radiation
that roars out of the center.


58
0:6:7,97 --> 0:6:13,68
If there is a galactic habitable zone... it's
thought to lie 26,000 light years from the


59
0:6:13,68 --> 0:6:19,979
center... about where we are... give or take
about 6,000 light years.


60
0:6:19,979 --> 0:6:26,65
According to one estimate, only about 5% of
the stars in our galaxy fall within it.


61
0:6:26,65 --> 0:6:34,21
But even out here - in the galactic suburbs
 - there are hazards. Some researchers have


62
0:6:34,21 --> 0:6:40,139
linked mass extinctions in the past to the
Sun's passage through one of the spiral arms,


63
0:6:40,139 --> 0:6:48,389
where other sources of dangerous gamma radiation
lie in wait.


64
0:6:48,389 --> 0:6:58,36
Somehow, though, we've made it through asteroid
impacts, climate changes, solar eruptions


65
0:6:58,36 --> 0:7:2,289
and everything else the galaxy has thrown
at us.


66
0:7:2,289 --> 0:7:12,3
Now we want to know... are there kindred spirits,
somewhere out there, to share our survival


67
0:7:12,3 --> 0:7:16,28
stories with?


68
0:7:16,28 --> 0:7:22,129
This image shows the single biggest obstacle
faced by planet hunters. We're looking at


69
0:7:22,129 --> 0:7:29,47
Earth, as photographed by the Voyager spacecraft,
from a distance of 3.7 billion miles.


70
0:7:29,47 --> 0:7:36,36
Our mighty world occupies only about one tenth
of one pixel.


71
0:7:36,36 --> 0:7:41,93
Try seeing something this small at hundreds
of thousands of times that distance.


72
0:7:41,93 --> 0:7:46,289
And try seeing it through the bright glare
of a star.


73
0:7:46,289 --> 0:7:52,889
Faced with these obstacles, astronomers have
developed ways to see them indirectly.


74
0:7:52,889 --> 0:7:59,36
Since 1995, Swiss and American teams have
discovered over 400 planets by looking for


75
0:7:59,36 --> 0:8:3,43
subtle shifts in the motion of their parent
stars.


76
0:8:3,43 --> 0:8:5,75
Here's what they'd see if they used this technique
 ...


77
0:8:5,75 --> 0:8:10,49
...to monitor our Sun for a period of 30 years
beginning in 1990.


78
0:8:10,49 --> 0:8:17,97
The sun would wobble, or dance about, due
to the gravitational tug of planets orbiting


79
0:8:17,97 --> 0:8:19,33
it.


80
0:8:19,33 --> 0:8:25,139
The technique for detecting this wobble is
so exquisitely developed that astronomers


81
0:8:25,139 --> 0:8:31,47
can see movements down to a meter per second:
human walking speed.


82
0:8:31,47 --> 0:8:37,2
But there's still a ways to go... Earth causes
our Sun to move at less than a tenth that


83
0:8:37,2 --> 0:8:38,62
speed.


84
0:8:38,62 --> 0:8:41,13
By analyzing the complexity of this movement...


85
0:8:41,13 --> 0:8:46,45
They have been able to tease out the sizes
and distances of the different planets tugging


86
0:8:46,45 --> 0:8:49,519
on the star.


87
0:8:49,519 --> 0:8:55,66
Initially, they detected huge gas giants,
many of which have wildly elliptical orbits


88
0:8:55,66 --> 0:9:0,74
that bring them in close to their stars before
driving them way out.


89
0:9:0,74 --> 0:9:7,13
Unfortunately, the giant's gravity would eventually
fling smaller Earth-sized planets out of the


90
0:9:7,13 --> 0:9:8,82
solar system.


91
0:9:8,82 --> 0:9:14,779
An exception is the star 55 Cancri, where
astronomers detected a Jupiter-sized planet


92
0:9:14,779 --> 0:9:17,29
with a nearly circular orbit.


93
0:9:17,29 --> 0:9:25,68
That's a good sign. Our Jupiter is thought
to have afforded Earth some protection by


94
0:9:25,68 --> 0:9:27,5
scooping up destructive asteroids.


95
0:9:27,5 --> 0:9:35,8
Beyond occupying a desirable location in the
Habitable Zone of its parent star... it helps


96
0:9:35,8 --> 0:9:38,81
if a planet has the right chemistry.


97
0:9:38,81 --> 0:9:44,5
Our Earth and solar system were likely born
within a crowded scene... like the Trifid


98
0:9:44,5 --> 0:9:50,63
nebula here... lashed by winds from hot giant
stars... and blasted by a violent explosion:


99
0:9:50,63 --> 0:9:55,39
a supernova.


100
0:9:55,39 --> 0:10:0,36
Nuclear burning within the core of large stars
is where most of the heavy elements - from


101
0:10:0,36 --> 0:10:8,23
iron and oxygen, to carbon and calcium - 
are generated. As our Sun formed at the center


102
0:10:8,23 --> 0:10:17,35
of an immense dusty disk, these elements became
concentrated in planets.


103
0:10:17,35 --> 0:10:21,7
Some of the most important elements in the
search for life have now been detected, because


104
0:10:21,7 --> 0:10:27,66
of the chance alignment of Earth and a solar
system 63 light years away that astronomers


105
0:10:27,66 --> 0:10:29,769
refer to as HD 189733.


106
0:10:29,769 --> 0:10:38,19
The Hubble and Spitzer space telescopes together
caught a planet whipping around this star


107
0:10:38,19 --> 0:10:40,649
every two Earth days.


108
0:10:40,649 --> 0:10:48,769
This is one sizzling planet... with surface
temperatures up around 900 degrees Celsius.


109
0:10:48,769 --> 0:10:58,86
The planet, tagged HD 189733-B, is so hot
that a vapor trail follows in its wake. Starlight


110
0:10:58,86 --> 0:11:5,86
passing through this trail allowed scientists
to detect carbon dioxide, methane gas... and


111
0:11:5,86 --> 0:11:9,92
water in its atmosphere.


112
0:11:9,92 --> 0:11:18,55
Then there's the sun-like star HD 209458,
visible with binoculars, 150 light years away.


113
0:11:18,55 --> 0:11:22,86
It has a planet, known as a "hot Jupiter."


114
0:11:22,86 --> 0:11:29,1
It's hot because it's close-in: as near as
7 million kilometers from the star... Compared


115
0:11:29,1 --> 0:11:40,339
to our planet Mercury, 46 million kilometers
out from our Sun...or the Earth, 146 million.


116
0:11:40,339 --> 0:11:45,24
Scientists estimate that stellar winds are
blowing some 10,000 tons of material every


117
0:11:45,24 --> 0:11:52,959
second off the surface of this hot gas giant.
How long before it gets reduced to a shriveled


118
0:11:52,959 --> 0:11:53,769
core?


119
0:11:53,769 --> 0:11:59,139
That's just what happened to the star called
CoRot-7. Astronomers spotted a planet slightly


120
0:11:59,139 --> 0:12:5,22
larger than Earth... and just about as dense.
But because little CoRoT-7b is so close to


121
0:12:5,22 --> 0:12:8,339
its parent star, it's most likely covered
in molten lava.


122
0:12:8,339 --> 0:12:15,18
If these planets are too close to their stars
to harbor life... many of the others discovered


123
0:12:15,18 --> 0:12:19,93
so far are too far away and too large.


124
0:12:19,93 --> 0:12:25,709
Like the one orbiting a star the ancient Arabs
called Fomulhaut - - meaning: "the mouth of


125
0:12:25,709 --> 0:12:34,18
the fish." It's just 25 light years away and
was the first "exoplanet" to be seen directly.


126
0:12:34,18 --> 0:12:39,74
Using Hubble, scientists blocked out Fomulhaut's
glare and found a planet orbiting about 10


127
0:12:39,74 --> 0:12:48,25
times farther out than Saturn. It would take
872 Earth years to make just one orbit.


128
0:12:48,25 --> 0:12:54,389
The brightness of this planet suggests that
it's huge and probably surrounded by a dusty


129
0:12:54,389 --> 0:12:54,389
disk.


130
0:12:54,389 --> 0:13:2,579
Astronomers are seeing hints of the diversity
of worlds imagined by the ancients... but


131
0:13:2,579 --> 0:13:7,51
still only scant evidence of anything resembling
Earth.


132
0:13:7,51 --> 0:13:13,97
Still, there's one class of stars that had,
until recently, been overlooked.


133
0:13:13,97 --> 0:13:19,94
The M-stars are the most numerous in our galaxy...
around 76% of the total.


134
0:13:19,94 --> 0:13:25,67
They are often called failed stars... because
not enough mass fell together as they were


135
0:13:25,67 --> 0:13:30,519
forming to fuel the intense nuclear fusion
that burns in stars like our sun.


136
0:13:30,519 --> 0:13:40,23
To be in the "Life Zone" of one of these dwarf
stars, a planet would have to be very close.


137
0:13:40,23 --> 0:13:46,4
Unfortunately, because these small stars spin
quickly when they're young, they are like


138
0:13:46,4 --> 0:13:51,279
electrical dynamos, with intense magnetic
fields that generate dangerous flares.


139
0:13:51,279 --> 0:13:57,949
If a planet manages to survive these flares,
it may have to endure another handicap.


140
0:13:57,949 --> 0:14:3,91
In close like this, it's likely to become
gravitationally locked to its parent star


141
0:14:3,91 --> 0:14:8,91
 - just like our Moon is to Earth - with only
one side ever facing the star.


142
0:14:8,91 --> 0:14:19,32
One side scorched... the other frozen. Is
there any hope?


143
0:14:19,32 --> 0:14:27,579
On Earth, we know that the unevenness of solar
heating, due to the day/night cycle, leads


144
0:14:27,579 --> 0:14:34,92
to oceanic and atmospheric circulation patterns
that redistribute the heat and equalize temperatures.


145
0:14:34,92 --> 0:14:40,62
A computer simulation performed by NASA scientists
showed that a tidally locked planet could,


146
0:14:40,62 --> 0:14:44,279
in fact, develop circulation patterns like
this.


147
0:14:44,279 --> 0:14:51,6
In the computer model, a cloud cover developed
on the light side: keeping temperatures down


148
0:14:51,6 --> 0:14:57,699
and air pressures high. The result: winds
that circled the planet, redistributing enough


149
0:14:57,699 --> 0:15:1,5
heat to keep the rate of freezing down.


150
0:15:1,5 --> 0:15:8,199
That's one reason these M stars are on planet
hunters' radars these days.


151
0:15:8,199 --> 0:15:11,61
Another reason is that planet hunting has
taken a leap forward.


152
0:15:11,61 --> 0:15:15,19
At the European Southern Observatory in the
mountains of Chile, an instrument that specializes


153
0:15:15,19 --> 0:15:22,259
in looking for solar wobbles has come on line.
HARPS - short for "High Accuracy Radial Velocity


154
0:15:22,259 --> 0:15:25,37
Planet Searcher" - has been on a planet finding
tear.


155
0:15:25,37 --> 0:15:34,42
At a recent conference, scientists announced
30 new planets discovered with this instrument.


156
0:15:34,42 --> 0:15:37,199
Among its most promising targets...


157
0:15:37,199 --> 0:15:43,709
Gliese 581, that inconspicuous red dwarf in
Libra.


158
0:15:43,709 --> 0:15:47,399
Four planets have been detected so far...


159
0:15:47,399 --> 0:15:53,6
Planet E is the lightest exoplanet discovered
to date, at 1.9 times the mass of Earth.


160
0:15:53,6 --> 0:15:59,699
But it's so close to its parent star that
its orbit takes only 3.15 days.


161
0:15:59,699 --> 0:16:1,6
It's likely a larger version of Mercury, scorched
by its sun and riddled with craters.


162
0:16:1,6 --> 0:16:7,589
Planet B is close too, and weighs 16 times
what Earth does.


163
0:16:7,589 --> 0:16:13,959
Planet C, at 5 Earth masses, lies just inside
the Habitable Zone...


164
0:16:13,959 --> 0:16:19,829
... while Planet D, at 7 Earth masses, lies
on its outside edge.


165
0:16:19,829 --> 0:16:24,579
To find out what direction these planets might
have taken, scientists have sought to model


166
0:16:24,579 --> 0:16:27,79
their early evolution.


167
0:16:27,79 --> 0:16:32,19
Planet C, on the inside margins of the life
zone, would have immediately been subjected


168
0:16:32,19 --> 0:16:35,4
to a withering barrage of solar radiation.


169
0:16:35,4 --> 0:16:41,92
Think Venus. Any water vapor in the atmosphere
would have been stripped away. Gases spewed


170
0:16:41,92 --> 0:16:45,769
out by volcanic activity would have turned
the atmosphere increasingly dense...


171
0:16:45,769 --> 0:16:54,4
A strong greenhouse effect would then have
turned Planet C into a hothouse world.


172
0:16:54,4 --> 0:16:56,399
Planet D is different.


173
0:16:56,399 --> 0:17:1,73
Earth-bound instruments showed that its gravitational
pull is surprisingly weak - meaning it's not


174
0:17:1,73 --> 0:17:8,77
very dense. That suggests that it might have
migrated in from the outer solar system, carrying


175
0:17:8,77 --> 0:17:11,69
with it significant amounts of hydrogen and
oxygen.


176
0:17:11,69 --> 0:17:18,3
It could be a water world, with an abundance
of vapor in the atmosphere that would strengthen


177
0:17:18,3 --> 0:17:21,73
its greenhouse effect.


178
0:17:21,73 --> 0:17:27,64
Of course, there are still many unknowns.
Is it far enough out to avoid becoming tidally


179
0:17:27,64 --> 0:17:32,79
locked? If it is locked, has it developed
circulation patterns strong enough to keep


180
0:17:32,79 --> 0:17:36,23
the freezing down on the dark side and support
a habitable climate?


181
0:17:36,23 --> 0:17:37,29
And does it have a magnetic field that protects
it against flares that may be bursting from


182
0:17:37,29 --> 0:17:37,42
its star?


183
0:17:37,42 --> 0:17:38,35
And is oxygen present in its atmosphere -
 one of the most prominent markers of life?


184
0:17:38,35 --> 0:17:43,5
Astronomers will continue to study the planets
of Gliese 581 in the years to come... as part


185
0:17:43,5 --> 0:17:48,77
of a rapidly expanding list of targets.


186
0:17:48,77 --> 0:17:56,5
The next era in planet hunting is now ramping
up with the recent launch of the Kepler planet-hunting


187
0:17:56,5 --> 0:18:1,77
spacecraft.


188
0:18:1,77 --> 0:18:6,53
Kepler amounts to a huge digital camera in
space, pointed at a region containing more


189
0:18:6,53 --> 0:18:10,23
than 100,000 stars...


190
0:18:10,23 --> 0:18:15,27
Its designers are betting that some of those
stars have planets...and that a fraction are


191
0:18:15,27 --> 0:18:21,14
tilted so that their planets pass between
their stars and Kepler's camera.


192
0:18:21,14 --> 0:18:27,9
If so, astronomers will detect subtle dips
in the brightness of these stars - by as little


193
0:18:27,9 --> 0:18:33,57
as one one-hundredth of a percent. That's
the signature of a planet passing in front.


194
0:18:33,57 --> 0:18:40,55
Another project is breaking new ground by
combining data from several ground-based telescopes.


195
0:18:40,55 --> 0:18:48,96
Astronomers recently used them to probe a
star called 61 Virginis, 28 light years away.


196
0:18:48,96 --> 0:18:54,3
It's nearly identical in mass and age to the
Sun. What's more, it was here that astronomers


197
0:18:54,3 --> 0:19:1,62
found the first Earth-like planets around
a Sun-like star, at 5 and 7.5 times the mass


198
0:19:1,62 --> 0:19:1,95
of Earth.


199
0:19:1,95 --> 0:19:9,53
A simulation of the atmosphere of the larger
one - picturing its flow of heat on a global


200
0:19:9,53 --> 0:19:16,92
scale - shows how much we can understand,
even at this distance. How long before a truly


201
0:19:16,92 --> 0:19:20,51
Earth-like planet is discovered?


202
0:19:20,51 --> 0:19:27,68
As astronomers' instruments get better - 
and their techniques more refined - it's likely


203
0:19:27,68 --> 0:19:36,1
that they'll discover smaller and smaller
planets.


204
0:19:36,1 --> 0:19:42,4
For now, though, the "Rare-Earth" hypothesis
may well have the edge over "Many Worlds."


205
0:19:42,4 --> 0:19:50,26
The conditions that nurture a habitable planet
seem hard to come by... such as position in


206
0:19:50,26 --> 0:19:55,59
the "life zone"; a nearly circular orbit;
and magnetic fields.


207
0:19:55,59 --> 0:20:6,71
The threats are many, solar flares... marauding
giant planets... tidal locking... and other


208
0:20:6,71 --> 0:20:11,25
lurking catastrophes.


209
0:20:11,25 --> 0:20:20,78
In fact, Nature has handed us a paradox: Medium-sized
stars like our Sun turn out to be particularly


210
0:20:20,78 --> 0:20:28,89
hostile to life. They emit barrages of ultraviolet
radiation... and solar outbursts powerful


211
0:20:28,89 --> 0:20:31,14
enough to ruin a fledgling atmosphere.


212
0:20:31,14 --> 0:20:36,84
And yet, somehow, we manage.


213
0:20:36,84 --> 0:20:46,66
So if it turns out that the Milky Way is filled
with habitable worlds... its not that the


214
0:20:46,66 --> 0:21:8,87
galactic real estate is so special... it's
that life finds a way.

0:21:8,87 --> 0:23:8,87
