1
0:0:1,519 --> 0:0:4,88
First and foremost, graphic design has to communicate something. But good graphic


2
0:0:4,88 --> 0:0:8,41
design makes people's lives better. You
have to find a way to make sense of


3
0:0:8,41 --> 0:0:11,23
how to make something beautiful and, to me,
you're speaking for them.


4
0:0:11,23 --> 0:0:14,869
As a graphic designer, concept is the
first thing; idea


5
0:0:14,869 --> 0:0:16,23
and life.


6
0:0:16,23 --> 0:0:26,169
Graphic design is essentially a language for living.


7
0:0:26,169 --> 0:0:28,439
Graphic design is about using


8
0:0:28,439 --> 0:0:34,12
words and images to convey a message. Graphic
designers have to know a lot about color


9
0:0:34,12 --> 0:0:38,999
theory, typography, how to create a grid. But those are all really


10
0:0:38,999 --> 0:0:43,16
basic. You have to be somebody that is
really interested in


11
0:0:43,16 --> 0:0:48,3
understanding human behavior, being able to
understand how they think, how they choose, how 


12
0:0:48,3 --> 0:0:50,3
they buy, how they believe.


13
0:0:50,3 --> 0:0:55,76
People probably don't think about how
much graphic design impacts them. We use


14
0:0:55,76 --> 0:1:0,64
graphic design to cross the street, to
decide what we want to eat and how much we


15
0:1:0,64 --> 0:1:1,4
want to eat.


16
0:1:1,4 --> 0:1:7,5
We use graphic design to pay our bills, to
get married. We use graphic design to get


17
0:1:7,5 --> 0:1:13,89
divorced. We use graphic design in every
single aspect of human life right now


18
0:1:13,89 --> 0:1:18,38
and people tend to like things best when
they feel that they are respected by that


19
0:1:18,38 --> 0:1:19,439
thing.


20
0:1:19,439 --> 0:1:23,46
But I think, ultimately, if it moves you,
whether it be a good emotion or a bad


21
0:1:23,46 --> 0:1:27,509
emotion, chances are that it's effective
because it's getting you to think about


22
0:1:27,509 --> 0:1:33,9
something and it's getting you to potentially
take action.


23
0:1:33,9 --> 0:1:38,23
When I work on package design I like
for there to be an idea behind it.


24
0:1:38,23 --> 0:1:43,0
I like for there to be some wit,
some language, some feeling that


25
0:1:43,0 --> 0:1:48,15
there is a human hand behind what you are interacting with.


26
0:1:48,15 --> 0:1:51,91
Like, for instance, matchbooks are one of
my favorite things to design. It's this


27
0:1:51,91 --> 0:1:55,38
nice intimate moment between you and
the smoker or


28
0:1:55,38 --> 0:1:58,479
candlelighter because you have the
reveal that can be completely


29
0:1:58,479 --> 0:2:3,67
surprising. For the Spice Market, we turned
them into these little incense boxes. I


30
0:2:3,67 --> 0:2:8,579
like to think about the product like
I'm the consumer. So, when we were working


31
0:2:8,579 --> 0:2:13,25
on the kleenex project, we learned that,
for some people, choosing which pattern


32
0:2:13,25 --> 0:2:16,37
on the box to take home is a huge part of


33
0:2:16,37 --> 0:2:19,189
their day. So, I think about


34
0:2:19,189 --> 0:2:24,189
what would give me a moments pleasure
when interacting with that thing.


35
0:2:24,189 --> 0:2:25,31
The Mercer Hotel was a


36
0:2:25,31 --> 0:2:29,709
really interesting project that was very
clean and very understated and witty.


37
0:2:29,709 --> 0:2:33,18
And not necessarily witty in the design but
also witty in the language. Like, for


38
0:2:33,18 --> 0:2:36,53
instance, there's always that sign on the
bathrobe that says "If you take it,


39
0:2:36,53 --> 0:2:39,55
you're going to have to pay for it." But we didn't
want to say that in such a crass way, so


40
0:2:39,55 --> 0:2:44,14
we just made a sign that very simply said "disrobe" and then, when


41
0:2:44,14 --> 0:2:48,14
you turned it over, it said "is available
for purchase in the lobby." And, so,


42
0:2:48,14 --> 0:2:50,319
sometimes maybe beautiful isn't


43
0:2:50,319 --> 0:2:52,45
exactly what it should be. Maybe it needs
to be


44
0:2:52,45 --> 0:2:56,459
quirky or maybe it needs to be ugly or maybe it
needs to be invisible.


45
0:2:56,459 --> 0:2:58,7
So, I think you're always solving what it has to


46
0:2:58,7 --> 0:3:5,939
look like visually based on what it
needs to be conceptually.


47
0:3:5,939 --> 0:3:8,689
A lot of times when people talk about
signage and environmental graphics they


48
0:3:8,689 --> 0:3:10,719
think that it always involves letters


49
0:3:10,719 --> 0:3:14,59
but it really involves landmarks,
creating a moment that somebody


50
0:3:14,59 --> 0:3:17,68
remembers and immediately understands.
Graphic designers aren't trained


51
0:3:17,68 --> 0:3:22,219
necessarily to think in dimension but you
do need to identify things within space


52
0:3:22,219 --> 0:3:25,769
that the architecture wouldn't necessarily
be doing otherwise; through color and type


53
0:3:25,769 --> 0:3:30,1
and light. Working on the signage for
Bloomberg's offices, they wanted people


54
0:3:30,1 --> 0:3:33,969
to use the stairs. We thought if people
are intended to use this space, why don't we


55
0:3:33,969 --> 0:3:37,269
at least make it interesting to use. If you
can make the space interesting people will


56
0:3:37,269 --> 0:3:41,469
want to be there. It really involves creating a
moment that somebody remembers and


57
0:3:41,469 --> 0:3:44,949
immediately understands. Bridge designs
are decorations that we have proposed


58
0:3:44,949 --> 0:3:49,599
for the city of Pittsburgh and our
proposal was to, essentially, make those


59
0:3:49,599 --> 0:3:54,659
moments special moments. So it could just be
a paint job or it could be using


60
0:3:54,659 --> 0:3:59,699
light in a certain way to highlight that
feature as a gateway to the north side.


61
0:3:59,699 --> 0:4:3,519
Every building has a timeline of your
experience with it. What's the cover of this


62
0:4:3,519 --> 0:4:8,509
book and then how does that play out as
one navigates through the space where your


63
0:4:8,509 --> 0:4:11,509
mind actually solves the problem.


64
0:4:11,509 --> 0:4:16,419
So, there's a process of discovery there.


65
0:4:16,419 --> 0:4:18,79
Should you judge a book by its cover?


66
0:4:18,79 --> 0:4:21,5
I would really like to say yes, but I
think that there's a lot of really good


67
0:4:21,5 --> 0:4:26,22
books out there that don't have good covers. My guiding philosophy in design is forever going


68
0:4:26,22 --> 0:4:27,3
to change, I think.


69
0:4:27,3 --> 0:4:30,479
You have to understand the responsibility
you have in terms of


70
0:4:30,479 --> 0:4:32,839
there's someone at the end of the line there


71
0:4:32,839 --> 0:4:35,61
that actually cares about what you're doing and


72
0:4:35,61 --> 0:4:36,949
you have to give it a voice.


73
0:4:36,949 --> 0:4:41,53
I never like to pin myself down to one
different style and, to me, that's what's fun about design as opposed to


74
0:4:41,53 --> 0:4:45,8
an illustrator's style. You can wear
different hats. The artistic expression,


75
0:4:45,8 --> 0:4:47,509
that is the art of it. Getting into the mind of a book,


76
0:4:47,509 --> 0:4:51,53
expressing what the book is about, making
it beautiful and grabbing people's attention.


77
0:4:51,53 --> 0:4:54,5
You always care about what are you
reading first and that's based on


78
0:4:54,5 --> 0:4:57,83
contrast of size, contrast of color, is the title more important than the author, can


79
0:4:57,83 --> 0:5:0,649
you read it from across the store or not. You know, these are the things that I think about


80
0:5:0,649 --> 0:5:4,49
on a daily basis. You have to understand
where this book fits in the world of


81
0:5:4,49 --> 0:5:9,699
books. The Day the World Ends is a poetry book
and here's an example of well, what do you focus on?


82
0:5:9,699 --> 0:5:13,129
You have all these different poems that are about different things so I broke the type


83
0:5:13,129 --> 0:5:15,87
up a little bit and the author just connected with it.


84
0:5:15,87 --> 0:5:18,77
If you love the content, you want
something to come up in your head when


85
0:5:18,77 --> 0:5:21,78
you think about it. So, any successful book cover
is something


86
0:5:21,78 --> 0:5:26,94
that you want to hold in your hand. It's
unexpected, smart, and beautiful but at


87
0:5:26,94 --> 0:5:28,419
the end of the day you just want to


88
0:5:28,419 --> 0:5:34,27
put it on your book shelf face out
because it means something to you.


89
0:5:34,27 --> 0:5:37,489
We use graphic design now in many ways to convey who we


90
0:5:37,489 --> 0:5:41,53
are as people, to define affiliations, to signal beliefs.


91
0:5:41,53 --> 0:5:44,16
If you can contribute to making
peoples lives a little bit better


92
0:5:44,16 --> 0:5:46,169
and elevating the general level of design, then why not?


93
0:5:46,169 --> 0:5:48,28
If you know how you want to make them


94
0:5:48,28 --> 0:5:51,34
feel, that's the most important thing. You just want to make something memorable.


95
0:5:51,34 --> 0:5:53,53
I say, do what you think is right and


96
0:5:53,53 --> 0:7:53,53
interesting and smart and then worry
about what the survey says.
