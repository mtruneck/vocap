###55 ALISON SEVERS: In 1979, the Soviet army entered
###58 Afghanistan, engaging in a brutal 10-year conflict which
###62 kick-started the Afghan opium trade.
###65 It was sold all over the world to help fund the fight against
###67 the Soviets, but the main customers of the opium were
###70 the Russians themselves.
###73 After the fall of the Soviet union in 1991, Russia's heroin
###77 problem continued to grow.
###79 So much so, that in 2011, the country has become the world's
###83 biggest consumer of heroin.
###84 [MUSIC CONTINUES]
###90 ALISON SEVERS: With a southern border more than 4,000 miles
###93 long, we're talking about a patrol area greater than the
###96 distance from New York to London.
###98 It's no wonder the drug trade is out of control.
###102 We travelled to the small Siberian city of Novokuznetsk,
###105 which lies just over the Russian border with
###107 Kazakhstan, and is on the front line
###109 of this heroin epidemic.
###111 Once a Siberian industrial powerhouse, now this city has
###115 fallen into decline, with 20% of its population allegedly
###119 addicted to heroin.
###121 We'd heard stories about ex-addicts building coffins to
###124 bury their friends, and religious cults disguised as
###126 rehab clinics.
###129 Worst of all though were rumors of a new moonshine drug
###131 called krokodil that has some terrifying consequences.
###136 Nowhere are Russia's drug problems more
###138 evident than here.
###139 
###147 We've come to an area where there's a lot of derelict
###149 building that are being squatted by addicts as a place
###152 to use and to live.
###157 Everywhere I look around me, there are syringes.
###160 There's more syringes here than I've ever seen in my
###163 entire life.
###165 MALE SPEAKER 2: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###166 
###180 ALISON SEVERS: Why are you hanging out here?
###182 MALE SPEAKER 2: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###183 
###216 ALISON SEVERS: This area is called Zavodskoy and was once
###218 the purpose-built housing estates
###220 of the Soviet workforce.
###222 Now, these imposing tower blocks are just empty shells.
###226 These young men have been living in this abandoned
###228 building for two months.

###376 ALISON SEVERS: Sasha Pelikhov works for an organization
###378 called Regenerate Russia, which helps rehabilitate
###380 heroin addicts in Novokuznetsk.
###381 
###385 Sasha explained to us that there might be more to the
###387 drug trade than just making money.
###389 SASHA PELIKHOV: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###390 
###417 ALISON SEVERS: There's a widely held belief that a
###419 phenomenon called narcoterrorism
###421 fuels the drug trade.
###422 It's said that Afghan terror groups help expediate the
###425 supply of heroin to Russia in order to both profit from
###428 their former invaders and also weaken the population by
###431 poisoning them with heroin.
###434 This is what's known as the Golden Crescent.
###436 It's the route that heroin takes from northern
###438 Afghanistan, throughout Central Asia, and into Russia.
###443 Sasha told us that the center of the local trade was at the
###446 food markets just outside the city center.
###448 It's where trucks from Kazakhstan are offloaded with
###451 heroin for distribution around Novokuznetsk
###453 and the wider areas.
###456 We were told to approach this place with extreme caution,
###459 and not to get out of the car.
###460 
###465 As we drove slowly through the market, we noticed gangs of
###467 men doing business next to their trucks.
###470 Many of them bore Kazakhstan license plates.
###473 It didn't take long to get us noticed.
###475 All of a sudden, someone spotted our cameras, and
###478 people started beeping their horns and yelling.
###481 MALE SPEAKER 7: Why are people beeping?
###483 MALE SPEAKER 7: Yeah, everyone's
###483 checking us out now.
###485 MALE SPEAKER 8: Yeah, let's just get the fuck out.
###486 MALE SPEAKER 7: Let's get the fuck out of there.
###490 Let's go.
###490 Let's go.
###491 Let's go.
###492 
###494 ALISON SEVERS: There's two pretty snazzy cars behind us.
###497 Those are the first snazzy cars I've seen
###498 since we've been here.
###499 Probably going to follow us and kill us now.
###502 The vans have got along the right-hand side of the number
###505 plate, had KZ, which means, obviously, the cars have been
###507 trucked in from Kazakhstan.
###509 MALE SPEAKER 9: It doesn't mean Kool Zines?
###510 ALISON SEVERS: No.
###511 It doesn't mean kool zines.
###512 It means fucking naughty heroin trafficker from
###514 Kazakhstan.
###515 That's what it fucking means.
###517 Well, there's still a car that looks the same.
###519 Or maybe all the cars just look the same.
###522 OK.
###523 
###527 We lost the cars and headed back to meet Sasha somewhere
###529 safe, or so we thought.
###533 MALE SPEAKER 10: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###534 
###560 ALISON SEVERS: It kind of just feels like walking into a
###562 forest in the middle of Siberia, plus a lot of very
###567 angry dogs.
###568 That one actually did that whole, like, err, I'm going to
###571 fucking kill you thing.
###572 
###577 After about five minutes of walking through Vorstadt, we
###580 met this guy.
###581 Sasha told us he was salvaging scrap metal, which is the most
###584 common way for heroin users to fund their addiction.
###587 MALE SPEAKER 11: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###588 
###592 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###601 MALE SPEAKER 11: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###605 [DOG GROWLING AND BARKING]
###622 MALE SPEAKER 9: What is it?
###624 ALISON SEVERS: Because I can't see where the syringes are.
###626 They're fucking everywhere.
###627 
###629 Opposite the rehabilitation center, there's just a
###635 deserted building where there's syringes all over the
###638 floor, and, like, empty bottles of this stuff.
###642 ALISON SEVERS: What's this?
###643 Sasha.
###645 MALE SPEAKER 12: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###646 SASHA PELIKHOV: What is in Tropikamid?
###648 [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###649 
###678 ALISON SEVERS: Sasha explained that the eyedrops were one of
###680 the main ingredients of a new drug called krokodil, a kind
###683 of moonshine heroin.
###686 Krokodil is so called because it turns the user's skin scaly
###690 and eats them from the inside out.
###691 SASHA PELIKHOV: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###693 
###726 ALISON SEVERS: That woman walked past us earlier when we
###728 were on our way out to the brothel.
###729 And Sasha told me the she's on the road, which mean she's a
###732 working prostitute.
###732 She's just walked past now.
###734 She's met up with a guy, and she's going to go have sex
###736 with him down there.
###738 Brilliant.
###738 That's completely depressing.
###741 Fucking hell.
###743 With high volumes of drug addicts comes high volumes of
###745 prostitution.
###747 And Novokuznetsk is no exception.
###749 What was worrying here was how young the girls were.
###752 So over there, I can see two girls.
###756 One of them looks about 14, and they've been talking to a
###760 succession of men who are stopping in cars at the side
###765 of the street.
###768 And in fact there's so much going on here with crime and
###775 drug use, you'd expect to see police cars and ambulances,
###777 but I haven't seen any of them.
###779 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###797 NATASHA: [SINGING IN RUSSIAN]
###798 
###808 [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###810 
###830 ALISON SEVERS: The Russian government offers very little
###831 support for addicts.
###833 There are no local state-funded rehab centers,
###836 and so the void has been filled by private
###838 organizations.
###839 They range from centers like this one, where the addicts
###841 provide volunteer work to pay for their treatment, to
###844 evangelical churches that have been accused of
###846 running like cults.
###847 
###850 OLEYSA: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###851 
###870 ALISON SEVERS: I heard a lot of people died.
###874 OLEYSA: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###875 
###882 NATASHA: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###883 
###887 ALISON SEVERS: Oh.
###887 NATASHA: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###889 
###916 ALISON SEVERS: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###917 NATASHA: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###919 
###923 [CHOIR SINGING]
###932 ALISON SEVERS: After we left the girls, we went to visit
###934 the priest of the main orthodox church in
###936 Novokuznetsk.
###937 
###939 I had to wear a head scarf in order to be
###941 able to talk to him.
###944 Spasibo.
###945 
###952 MINISTER VASILY: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###953 
###980 ALISON SEVERS: So this is the bit that we bought in the shop
###983 in your church.
###984 And it says, Christian sects, how they're servants of the
###987 anti-Christ.
###988 Is this relevant in this city?
###991 MINISTER VASILY: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###992 
###1037 YEVGENY: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###1038 
###1057 ALISON SEVERS: This is Yevgeny.
###1058 By day, he's a funeral director, and by night, he run
###1061 the Novokuznetsk branch of Teen Challenge, which is an
###1064 American Christian charity that now has missionaries and
###1067 centers in over 70 countries around the world, and it's
###1070 growing rapidly.
###1072 He told us to come along to meet his congregation in a
###1075 remote part of the city which was an hour drive up a very
###1078 steep hill.
###1079 And when we arrived, we found this.
###1081 [RUSSIAN ROCK MUSIC PLAYING]
###1085 ALISON SEVERS: This is the sleeping room for the
###1088 brotherhood here at Teen Challenge, which is Yevgeny's
###1092 church group
###1093 [SINGING IN RUSSIAN[
###1103 ALISON SEVERS: This is a rehabilitation center for
###1105 people involved in Teen Challenge, which is an
###1110 American church that's come to Russia.
###1114 And now Yevgeny practices their doctrine.
###1117 
###1122 I think that Teen Challenge is a cult, to be honest.
###1126 MALE SPEAKER 13: Today, I live here six months.
###1130 Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
###1135 Jesus Christ help me.
###1139

###1177 [APPLAUSE]
###1178 WORSHIP LEADER: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###1180 
###1184 ALISON SEVERS: This is Sergey.
###1185 We met him begging outside on the street, and he said most
###1188 of the people he knew have been affected
###1189 by heroin and krokodil.
###1191 SERGEY: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###1192 
###1217 SEREZHA: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###1218 
###1247 ALISON SEVERS: Later that night, Sergey took us on a
###1249 tour of local pharmacies to show us how easy it is to pick
###1252 up the ingredients for krokodil.
###1254 So these are 24-hour pharmacies
###1255 that we're going to.
###1257 You can do this any time of the day.
###1261 SERGEY: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###1262 
###1303 ALISON SEVERS: Sergey said he knew someone who could cook
###1305 the krokodil for us.
###1307 He promised to meet us again.
###1309 That was the last time we saw him.
###1310 
###1315 ALEXEY: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###1317 
###1329 ALISON SEVERS: Alexey is the pastor of an independent
###1330 church that reforms heroin and krokodil addicts.
###1334 ALEXEY: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###1335 
###1347 ALISON SEVERS: Alexey took us to meet his friend, whose
###1349 family has been destroyed by krokodil.
###1351 With a drug that can kill it users so quickly, it's very
###1355 rare to meet survivors.
###1358 LYUDMILA: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###1359 
###1393 MISHA: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###1395 SERGEY: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###1399 ALISON SEVERS: And you been taking krokodil?
###1402 SERGEY: We have, yeah.
###1405 MISHA: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###1406 
###1412 ALISON SEVERS: When did you start taking it?
###1415 MISHA: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###1416 
###1429 SERGEY: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###1431 MISHA: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###1433 
###1437 LYUDMILA: [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]
###1439 
###1456 ALISON SEVERS: I felt quite helpless leaving Lyudmila's
###1458 house, but nowhere near as helpless as she must feel.
###1462 Her health, home, and family life have been totally
###1465 destroyed by krokodil, a drug you can just work out how to
###1469 make with the help of internet forums.
###1472 President Medvedev has talked about closing down the
###1474 websites that are providing this information, but the
###1477 internet seems harder to police than the border.
###1480 I can't see any way out for these people if they're
###1482 relying on that.
###1485 Drug users are developing new, terrifying ways of consuming
###1488 opiates faster than the government can decide on any
###1491 form of policy.
###1492 The church and the sects aren't the answer, but sadly,
###1495 they seem to be the best hope these young people have in a
###1499 city that really does feel like it's been forgotten.
###1501
