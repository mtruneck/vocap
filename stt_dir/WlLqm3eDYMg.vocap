###0 i was repelled by what had been newtown as you can tell by the dozens of videos
###4 that i made about it and everytime i'd say about the video we showed you with
###8 the kids in them
###10 when the baseball had
###12 parent crying
###14 part about how
###15 his daughter
###16 lit up the room
###17 uh... i have a hard time cuban at the end
###21 but what's interesting is that
###23 when i a drone strikes
###26 kids that are not american
###28 and gets almost no coverage
###30 and people are not broken about about it
###32 then the president who was teary eyed about
###35 new town which is exactly what he should have been when you you've got a control
###38 on that
###40 uh... is not teary-eyed about
###42 civilian casualties
###44 throughout strikes
###47 the reason we have all machala out they risk is is a town in southern yemen
###51 and uh...
###52 we actually the tomahawk missile strikes there
###56 and there is also cluster bombs as well
###59 and we killed fourteen women and twenty one children
###65 twenty one children
###66 now newtown there was twenty kids killed twenty eight overall
###70 now of course the u_s_ says that's all incredibly different because we're
###73 trying to target militants
###75 in which are in any milton cements right
###78 well it's unclear when there is reporting
###80 bhaiyya many journalists
###82 and prepare that said and that showed the bombs were from the u_s_
###86 and they show the civilian deaths
###87 so what happened the journalists to show the civilian deaths
###90 he was put in prison by the government yemen
###93 uh... they will let him out
###95 cub leaders later
###96 there were a pardon soleil who's no longer president him it was going to do
###99 it
###100 this is a journalist than it was obvious and the people yemen were upset
###103 but he was put in jail uh... for
###106 covering the civilian deaths
###107 present nobama called
###109 and said no
###111 the u_s_ government still calls at your list of terrorist
###115 do not give mum pardoned put him back in jail and they did
###117 and he still in jail today
###119 vice-president while made that call
###121 why 'cause we don't want the world
###124 to see the kids
###126 that died because of or box
###128 now i know a lot of people think there's justified in collateral damage
###132 but at least see the kids first
###135 as we didn't in the newtown massacre
###137 before you make that decision
###140 now brave new foundation went
###143 talk to people on the ground where the straw strikes happen
###147 lot of these victims are from
###149 pakistan
###150 yemen somalia it's ever been not or from
###153 all majali in fact all machala
###155 as i told you was a tomahawk cruise missile strike
###158 but look at
###159 the different rose strikes
###161 killed those kids throughout the world
###176 myself am
###177 three-years-old
###178 solace listed his fans
###180 generates pancake carries
###181 two thousand seven
###183 no-risk cited in years old
###185 selfless there's time
###187 february fourteen to four months for cited references that we have to last
###191 ten years old not take their standard counter-terrorism efforts has been
###195 exceptionally circle an exceptionally target areas because he has been very
###198 precise
###199 precision strikes against off at that time
###202 no it was a response
###203 u_s_ officials to thrones are highly actors want to start seven-year zones
###208 have not caused a huge number of civilian casualties sha three years old
###212 you're able to target and smuts more precision dot times all the actions that
###216 we take his fully consistent with international loans from the past here
###220 that has invented a single collateral death orphans of his money managers to
###224 make a lot but life is really war really have a very colorful about
###229 from boarding civilian casualty
###234 so when we say that
###236 the kids were not killed in the news
###238 no civilian tags please we are indisputably line
###241 based on
###242 reporting
###244 based on international groups that have gone on the ground and seen
###248 the dead kids the you just saw
###252 if that doesn't
###253 also cause you
###255 to think hate me he would do something long there as well
###260 act you got a question yourself on that
###264 now the thing is
###266 as you dipping will be doing this
###269 are also have concerts 'cause they've seen it
###272 one particular guy is brenda brian hughes a u_s_ strong pilot
###276 and equip because uh... he was
###279 racked with guilt over killing civilians
###282 now the u_s_ media of course has not cover that story almost at all
###286 there should be going for many did you talk to
###288 and here's how he explains one particular instance they say bryan in
###292 his co-workers sat in for a fourteen computer monitors and four keyboards
###296 when brian press the button in new mexico someone died on the other side of
###300 the world
###301 he remembers one incident very clearly when a predator john was circling a
###306 figure a pattern in the sky above afghanistan
###311 the article explains it was a countdown and neice heat
###314 bryant's job was to focuses the laser on where the drone was going to go
###319 and a guy sitting next to him
###321 pushes the but
###322 but he can move the laser and if he does the bond those elsewhere
###326 and is a countdown happening in ec he's seen go to seventeen seconds in the
###331 bench leaves you about the sea
###332 seven seconds
###334 any sinking down i don't know who's in there i hope they got the right
###336 information
###337 and the their spiegel picks it up from there
###340 was seven seconds left the dell
###342 there was no one to be seen on the ground brian could still have diverted
###344 the missile at that point that it was down to three seconds by felt as if he
###348 had to count each individual pixel on the monitor
###352 suddenly the child walk around the corner recess
###359 the story then continues
###361 second zero was the moment in which bryant's digital world collided with the
###366 real one
###367 in a village between bob louden
###369 and mosser he sure re
###372 bryant saw flash on the screen
###374 the explosion
###376 parts of the building collapsed
###377 the child had disappeared
###379 brian sick feeling in his stomach
###382 burma this is one of our drome parts
###385 and he says
###386 did we just kill a kid
###388 he asked the man sitting next to him
###391 and the man who pushed the button says yeah
###393 i guess that was a kid the pilot replied
###398 so they asked was that a kidney road in the chat window on the monitor
###403 their shingle continues this someone they didn't know answer
###406 someone sitting in the military command center somewhere in the world could
###410 observe their attack
###412 no so that was a dog a personal
###416 they went back
###417 ang be reviewed the scene on the video
###422 and dog
###423 on two legs
###428 so when they tell you we don't kill civilians
###431 and you know they're lying because
###433 recently they reclassified every
###437 military age now
###440 and by the way there now including children in that two we did that story
###443 as well
###445 as young as eight years old
###447 is saying
###448 by definition
###449 there now
###450 all considered militants
###452 if we killed them
###454 you have to prove
###455 that they were innocent
###457 otherwise
###458 we assume they were militants
###460 that they did that to our kids what would we think
###463 look at what happened in newtown and how devastated we work
###468 and ever seen anything practice areas had devastating the figure minutes
###472 and all these places were were due intro strike every pros right
###476 and then
###477 adding insult to injury we call the kids dogs
###481 because we couldn't possibly make a mistake
###484 glenn greenwald made a good point about this is part of the dehumanizing amo of
###488 muslims across the world
###490 this is hard to kill kids
###492 it's hard to live with that is bryan found that he couldn't live with it
###496 and so he moved on any quit that job
###499 so what do we do now and i know
###501 they're not kids they're militants
###504 and if it looks on
###505 camel like their kid
###506 we're going to calm a dog
###510 if those kids don't also affect you
###514 i think you got a question yourself man
###516 i'm ripped apart by what happened newtown
###519 masa ripped apart by what happened on
###521 in almond jhala
###522 and so many different
###524 cities across pakistan yemen
###526 and other countries that we do draw strict
