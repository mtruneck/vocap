###1 CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome to CNN STUDENT NEWS, your commercial- free source for news
###4 for middle and high school classrooms. My name is Carl Azuz. Returning from the Thanksgiving
###8 holiday, our first story today will take us to the Middle East.
###24 There has been a break in the fighting between Israelis and Palestinians. A cease-fire started
###29 to take hold last week. And the two sides are scheduled to meet today in Egypt where
###34 they`ll discuss what they want as part of a longer term peace deal. The most recent
###39 conflict lasted eight days in mid-November and left dozens of Palestinians and six Israelis
###44 dead. Palestinians fired rockets from the region of Gaza that exploded in the Israeli
###49 communities, and Israel launched air strikes targeting Palestinian militants that also
###54 caused civilian casualties. Israeli forces had been preparing for a possible invasion
###59 of Gaza last week, that`s when the U.S., the U.N. and Egypt got involved, helping get the
###64 two sides to agree to a cease-fire. That happened last Wednesday, and though there has been
###69 some limited fighting since then, the cease fire appears to be holding.
###74 Egypt, meanwhile, is having some trouble of its own: in the capital city of Cairo where
###79 massive protests led to the ouster of its formal leader in 2011, there were clashes
###84 yesterday. They were between protesters and government forces. Many Egyptians are angry
###90 with their new president Mohamed Morsi. Last Thursday, Morsi issued this edict that basically
###96 says: any decree or law that he has made since he took office cannot be overturned by Egyptian
###102 courts until a new constitution is finished. That can happen in six months, and that, along
###108 with some of his other actions, has some Egyptians calling him a dictator. Morsi is promising
###114 his new powers are only temporary.
###117 China is the third stop in our international coverage today. Something you don`t see very
###121 often: a house on a highway. Look at this. A neighborhood was torn down to make way for
###128 the road you see right here. But the farmer who lives in this house, says the government
###132 offered him $35,000 to leave his property when he paid $95,000 to build it. The government
###140 raised the offer to 41,000, but that still wasn`t enough for the farmer. So officials
###144 literally built the road around the house. It`s not yet open to traffic, and the local
###149 officials expect the homeowner to work out a deal with the government soon. But this
###153 has become symbolic of the struggle between Chinese homeowners and the government that
###158 they say doesn`t offer them enough money to relocate.

###161 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It`s time for "The Shoutout." The term "bicameral" means having two of what?
###168 If you think you know it, then shout it out! Is it: parties, lenses, cylinders or chambers?
###174 You`ve got three seconds, go!
###176 In a bicameral legislature, there are two chambers or houses. That`s your answer, and that`s
###190 your "Shoutout."
###191 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###193 AZUZ: Those who serve in America`s bicameral legislature, are back at work today, and along
###198 with the president, representatives and senators have a major challenge ahead in December:
###203 the fiscal cliff you`ve heard us talk about. Senators and representatives and the president
###207 are trying to find a way to avoid this. And it all comes down to agree on how the government
###212 spends money and takes in money. But with Democrats controlling the Senate and Republicans
###217 controlling the House of Representatives, Athena Jones explains how compromise is going
###221 to be the name of the game.
###222 (BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)
###223 ATHENA JONES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: After meeting with President Obama before the Thanksgiving
###226 holiday ...
###227 BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: Well, I want to welcome the congressional
###230 leadership here ...
###230 JONES: Congressional leaders expressed optimism about reaching a deal to avoid $500 billion
###236 in tax increases and spending cuts set to take effect next year.
###240 REP. JOHN BOEHNER, (R ), HOUSE SPEAKER: We had a very constructive meeting with the president
###243 to talk about America`s fiscal problem.
###246 SEN. HARRY REID (D), NEVADA: We have the cornerstones of being able to work something out.
###249 JONES: Staffers have been working behind the scenes to find common ground. Among the big
###253 sticking points, how to bring in more tax revenue and reduce spending on programs like
###259 Medicare.
###259 But it`s not yet clear when lawmakers and the president will meet next. And even if
###265 some progress is made this week, a final deal could still be a long way off.
###270 JENNIFER LIBERTO, CNNMONEY.COM SENIOR WRITER: We barely see the Hill and the White House
###274 make decisions early. They tend to do better when they have a deadline.
###279 (END VIDEOTAPE)
###280 AZUZ: That deadline at this time is January 1. That`s how long Congress has to reach an
###284 agreement on the fiscal cliff.
###286 The U.S. northeast, still cleaning up from Superstorm Sandy, it will be for quite a while,
###291 officials say sanitation crews have picked up 280,000 tons of trash and debris in New
###297 York alone. But while gas rationing is over, transportation is getting back to normal,
###303 thousands of people in New York and New Jersey still didn`t have power going into the weekend
###308 and many still didn`t have heat.
###310 That, along with some other factors have created some new problems for storm victims. Mary
###315 Snow reports on the dangers you can`t see.
###318 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###318 MARY SNOW, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Lurking in the devastation from Sandy is yet another worry
###322 for homeowners. Exposure to toxins, mold and dust and in some places, sewage.
###328 Long Beach homeowner Fred Morello will only enter his house wearing a protective suit
###333 and mask as he clears out areas that were submerged in several feet of water.
###338 FRED MORELLO, LONG BEACH HOMEOWNER: I`m concerned about molds? Sure. But at this particular
###343 point, I don`t have a time for it. I have things to get done. And they`ve got to get
###348 done. So I protect myself as best I can.
###350 SNOW: While Morello says, he has no time to get checked for the cough he now has, others
###355 have been showing up to MASH-like tents set up by federal disaster medical assistance
###360 teams.
###360 (on camera): You`ve been to other disaster areas.
###362 UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Correct.
###363 SNOW (voice over): Commander Kevin McGuillakati (ph) says besides people seeking psychological
###367 treatment, they`ve mostly come in complaining of coughs, bronchitis and asthma. Since the
###372 base was set up November 13th.

###375 UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What`s the word? The major online shopping event that follows Black
###381 Friday? Cyber Monday, that`s the word.
###389 (END VIDEO CLIP)
###392 AZUZ: And we have reports on both of those shopping days. First today, Cyber Monday when
###398 discounts are offered online. Definitely, it doesn`t look as hectic as many Black Friday
###403 events, but Cyber Monday shoppers who will be dressed in everything from business suits
###407 at work to pajamas at home will be surfing for sales.
###411 A couple of interesting notes this year: Cyber Monday 2012 actually started last week. Online
###416 discounts were offered before and on Thanksgiving and during the weekend. Also, more Americans
###422 are doing their shopping on phones and tablets this time around, and many are looking for
###427 phone and tablet discounts online as well.
###431 As far as Black Friday itself went more shoppers turned out for the event than last year, but
###435 they didn`t appear to spend as much money. This Youtube clip shows you one of the hectic
###440 Black Friday scenes: crowds clamoring to get in the malls and big box stores like Target
###446 or Toys "R" Us. Black Friday store visits went up 3.5 percent from 2011, but spending
###452 was down by almost two percent. That could be partly because many sales started before
###458 Black Friday, so some folks might have shopped early. Retailers and analysts pay close attention
###463 to all of this stuff to get a sense of how Americans are spending in a slow economy.
###468 Don`t know yet how they are spending, but we do know what many Americans are eating:
###473 leftover turkey, a bird banquet is part of Thanksgiving tradition for many of us. But
###478 there is another tradition dating back to 1989 that you might not have heard about:
###483 the presidential turkey pardon. It guarantees at least one bird won`t wind up on anyone`s
###489 table. Karin Caifa tells us where these lucky turkeys go to leave.
###494 (BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)
###495 KARIN CAIFA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: An annual reprise:
###498 BILL CLINTON: I`m told that Jerry the Turkey travel all the way here from Wisconsin.
###501 CAIFA: A long line of lucky birds:
###504 GEORGE W. BUSH: May and Flower, they are certainly better than the names the vice president suggested,
###510 which was Lunch and Dinner.
###513 (laughter)
###514 CAIFA: On Wednesday, President Obama added Gobbler and Cobbler to that least, the annual
###519 White House turkey pardon.
###521 BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA: I have one more gift to give,
###523 and it goes to a pair of turkeys named Cobbler and Gobbler.
###528 CAIFA: But after the camera stopped rolling, and the president heads back to the Oval Office,
###533 what does happen to those pardoned turkeys? Well, they`ll come right here, to the home
###538 of the nation`s first president. First stop, this specially prepared pen on the grounds
###543 of Mount Vernon, George Washington`s historic estate in Virginia. They`ll be a main attraction
###548 at a holiday festival for six weeks. Then, a tranquil retirement.
###552 DEAN NORTON, MOUNT VERNON HORTICULTURE DIRECTOR: After the six weeks, they`ll move back to
###555 our livestock department, and be with all sorts of other animals, and you are just always
###559 thrilled when they get back there.
###560 CAIFA: Historically, it`s appropriate. It was George Washington who suggested a national
###564 day of Thanksgiving in 1789. Giving thanks for life beyond Thanksgiving dinner. In Washington,
###571 I`m Karin Caifa for CNN STUDENT NEWS.
###574 (END VIDEOTAPE)
###574 AZUZ: It`s hard to think of puns for the word "turkey" I mean there are other ideas we could
###579 shout from the rafters like that gobbles up our time for today. When we couldn`t a leg
###584 up on any great ideas, and when the whole gang couldn`t cook up anything better, we
###588 just decided to wing it. CNN STUDENT NEWS continues tomorrow. I hope to see you then.
