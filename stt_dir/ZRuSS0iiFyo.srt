0:1:1,8 --> 0:1:3,51
Liberia for a long time.


22
0:1:3,51 --> 0:1:6,9
It's America's first
and only foray into


23
0:1:6,9 --> 0:1:8,78
quasi-colonialism in Africa.


24
0:1:8,78 --> 0:1:12,17
It started as a back-to-Africa
movement for freed slaves and,


25
0:1:12,17 --> 0:1:14,75
in fact, their constitution
was written in Washington.


26
0:1:14,75 --> 0:1:18,62
And Monrovia, the capital city
of Liberia, is actually named


27
0:1:18,62 --> 0:1:19,91
after President Monroe.


28
0:1:19,91 --> 0:1:22,5
It became a state
in the 1840s.


29
0:1:22,5 --> 0:1:25,99
So the freed slaves go back to
Africa and promptly enslave


30
0:1:25,99 --> 0:1:29,38
the native Africans based on the
plantation method they had


31
0:1:29,38 --> 0:1:32,89
learned in the US, which lasts
for about 140 years, until

0:1:32,89 --> 0:1:36,81

African-born Liberian,

0:4:59,3 --> 0:5:2,66
it's totally chaotic.


96
0:5:2,66 --> 0:5:5,7
In fact, when we went to pick
up Myles, he had just gotten


97
0:5:5,7 --> 0:5:7,21
out the hospital with malaria.

we asked Myles what's up with

And he said, well, a lot of

0:8:58,65 --> 0:8:59,51
give them the tape.


208
0:8:59,51 --> 0:9:2,6
There's nothing on the tape.


209
0:9:2,6 --> 0:9:2,29
SHANE SMITH: Yeah.


210
0:9:2,29 --> 0:9:6,0
We do, right now.


211
0:9:6,0 --> 0:9:7,25
GENERAL BIN LADEN: We'll
go to my warehouse.


212
0:9:7,25 --> 0:9:12,0



213
0:9:12,0 --> 0:9:12,33
SHANE SMITH: OK.


214
0:9:12,33 --> 0:9:13,58
GENERAL BIN LADEN: Don't
worry about that.


215
0:9:13,58 --> 0:9:21,93



216
0:9:21,93 --> 0:9:26,752
SHANE SMITH: Our trip is getting
progressively heavier.


217
0:9:26,752 --> 0:9:27,674
SHANE SMITH: Yeah,
that'll be good.


218
0:9:27,674 --> 0:9:29,57
GENERAL BIN LADEN: We're going
on top of the building.


219
0:9:29,57 --> 0:9:29,895
SHANE SMITH: OK.


220
0:9:29,895 --> 0:9:31,92
I'm kind of a little bit worried
that the police are


221
0:9:31,92 --> 0:9:33,33
gonna come get us right now.


222
0:9:33,33 --> 0:9:36,106
I gave them a fake name
and fake number.


223
0:9:36,106 --> 0:9:40,67



224
0:9:40,67 --> 0:9:42,59
SHANE SMITH: OK, nice
to meet you.


225
0:9:42,59 --> 0:9:44,51
SHANE SMITH: Nice to meet you.


226
0:9:44,51 --> 0:9:47,77



227
0:9:47,77 --> 0:9:48,46
SHANE SMITH: Thank you.


228
0:9:48,46 --> 0:9:49,2
Thank you.


229
0:9:49,2 --> 0:9:51,9
So after we got bin Laden out
of jail, he was very excited


230
0:9:51,9 --> 0:9:54,17
to get us up to his rooftop
and tell us his story.


231
0:9:54,17 --> 0:9:56,96
And according to him, the
ex-generals, who are now the


232
0:9:56,96 --> 0:9:59,68
community leaders, are the only
ones doing anything to


233
0:9:59,68 --> 0:10:0,63
help the people.


234
0:10:0,63 --> 0:10:3,38
SHANE SMITH: So maybe you could
explain a little bit


235
0:10:3,38 --> 0:10:5,91
about-- so first of all, you
became known as bin Laden


236
0:10:5,91 --> 0:10:6,495
during the war?


237
0:10:6,495 --> 0:10:7,46
GENERAL BIN LADEN:
During the war.


238
0:10:7,46 --> 0:10:9,22
SHANE SMITH: And then after the
war, now you're sort of


239
0:10:9,22 --> 0:10:11,43
trying to help people by
carpentry and by karate.


240
0:10:11,43 --> 0:10:12,68
GENERAL BIN LADEN: Karate.


241
0:10:12,68 --> 0:10:29,816



242
0:10:29,816 --> 0:10:32,4
SHANE SMITH: Do you get
any money here?


243
0:10:32,4 --> 0:10:35,95



244
0:10:35,95 --> 0:10:37,973
SHANE SMITH: No, but the UN or
the government doesn't give


245
0:10:37,973 --> 0:10:40,9
you any money?


246
0:10:40,9 --> 0:10:41,34
SHANE SMITH : Nothing?


247
0:10:41,34 --> 0:10:49,52



248
0:10:49,52 --> 0:10:52,79
SHANE SMITH: And is this area--
this is red light here?


249
0:10:52,79 --> 0:10:53,96
GENERAL BIN LADEN:
It's a red light.


250
0:10:53,96 --> 0:10:54,925
This is red light.


251
0:10:54,925 --> 0:10:55,88
SHANE SMITH: And is it--


252
0:10:55,88 --> 0:10:57,14
is there a lot of crime
in red light?


253
0:10:57,14 --> 0:10:57,56
MALE SPEAKER : Oh yeah.


254
0:10:57,56 --> 0:10:58,635
GENERAL BIN LADEN
: Yeah, it's--


255
0:10:58,635 --> 0:10:59,45
this is red light.


256
0:10:59,45 --> 0:11:2,39
SHANE SMITH : Red light.


257
0:11:2,39 --> 0:11:23,63



258
0:11:23,63 --> 0:11:40,24



259
0:11:40,24 --> 0:11:42,7
SHANE SMITH : So Myles comes
over, stops the interview, and


260
0:11:42,7 --> 0:11:45,13
says, we have to get the
fuck out of here now.


261
0:11:45,13 --> 0:11:47,2
Bin Laden looks down and
he goes, yeah, yeah,


262
0:11:47,2 --> 0:11:48,14
those aren't my guys.


263
0:11:48,14 --> 0:11:49,39
You guys should really go.


264
0:11:49,39 --> 0:11:51,965



265
0:11:51,965 --> 0:11:53,65
SHANE SMITH : So bin Laden
gave us an escort, and a


266
0:11:53,65 --> 0:11:56,6
couple of his guys got us
through the crowd to the car,


267
0:11:56,6 --> 0:11:59,216
and we got the fuck out.


268
0:11:59,216 --> 0:12:0,194
SHANE SMITH : So let's go.


269
0:12:0,194 --> 0:12:4,595
Let's go, let's go, let's
go, let's go.


270
0:12:4,595 --> 0:12:7,53
Holy fucking shit.


271
0:12:7,53 --> 0:12:8,21
That was out of hand.


272
0:12:8,21 --> 0:12:9,46
We gotta get out of here.


273
0:12:9,46 --> 0:12:13,48



274
0:12:13,48 --> 0:12:17,15
There was some heavy duty
Libs there, boy.


275
0:12:17,15 --> 0:12:20,75
So after meeting and being
freaked out by General bin


276
0:12:20,75 --> 0:12:23,29
Laden, we wanted to see what
the UN and government were


277
0:12:23,29 --> 0:12:25,64
doing to rebuild Liberia.


278
0:12:25,64 --> 0:12:28,36
We met a local journalist named
Nagbe, and we asked him,


279
0:12:28,36 --> 0:12:30,86
and he said, you want to the
government and UN are doing?


280
0:12:30,86 --> 0:12:32,11
I'll take you to West Point.


281
0:12:32,11 --> 0:12:38,28



282
0:12:38,28 --> 0:12:40,71
West Point is the worst slum in
Liberia, which makes it one


283
0:12:40,71 --> 0:12:43,38
of the worst slums in West
Africa, which makes it one of


284
0:12:43,38 --> 0:12:44,69
the worst slums in the world.


285
0:12:44,69 --> 0:12:47,17
Now, when you first get there,
the first thing you want to do


286
0:12:47,17 --> 0:12:48,38
is get the hell out.


287
0:12:48,38 --> 0:12:50,15
It's open sewers everywhere--


288
0:12:50,15 --> 0:12:53,54
shit, piss, garbage, everything
mixed in--


289
0:12:53,54 --> 0:12:56,7
and the stench is
overpowering.


290
0:12:56,7 --> 0:13:23,55



291
0:13:23,55 --> 0:13:25,51
SHANE SMITH : Oh, dude.


292
0:13:25,51 --> 0:13:26,98
It really stinks here.


293
0:13:26,98 --> 0:13:36,29



294
0:13:36,29 --> 0:13:39,27



295
0:13:39,27 --> 0:13:42,12
SHANE SMITH : But, I mean, one
of the first basic rules is


296
0:13:42,12 --> 0:13:43,73
don't shit where you eat.


297
0:13:43,73 --> 0:13:44,16
IMMANUEL NAGBE: That's
it, but--


298
0:13:44,16 --> 0:13:45,41
SHANE SMITH: That's
a number one rule.


299
0:13:45,41 --> 0:13:48,69



300
0:13:48,69 --> 0:13:50,4
SHANE SMITH: But the government
has to do something


301
0:13:50,4 --> 0:13:51,29
about that.


302
0:13:51,29 --> 0:13:57,48



303
0:13:57,48 --> 0:13:58,68
SHANE SMITH: Mm-hmm.


304
0:13:58,68 --> 0:14:1,88
So even in one of the worst
slums of Western Africa, you


305
0:14:1,88 --> 0:14:4,44
see the cultural impact that
America has there.


306
0:14:4,44 --> 0:14:7,14
All the kids are wearing Biggie
or Tupac t-shirts.


307
0:14:7,14 --> 0:14:10,33
In fact, one kid came up to us
and said, hey, I'm a rapper.


308
0:14:10,33 --> 0:14:11,24
Can I rap for you?


309
0:14:11,24 --> 0:14:12,56
And we said yes.


310
0:14:12,56 --> 0:14:16,8
And it wasn't about bling, and
it wasn't about Cristal.


311
0:14:16,8 --> 0:14:50,4



312
0:14:50,4 --> 0:14:53,37
SHANE SMITH: And is there a
lot of malaria in here?


313
0:14:53,37 --> 0:14:55,3
SHANE SMITH : Needless to say,
in West Point, health


314
0:14:55,3 --> 0:14:56,81
conditions are foul.


315
0:14:56,81 --> 0:14:58,8
Disease is everywhere--


316
0:14:58,8 --> 0:15:1,76
malaria, infections, and
AIDS are rampant.


317
0:15:1,76 --> 0:15:11,84



318
0:15:11,84 --> 0:15:14,84



319
0:15:14,84 --> 0:15:16,47
SHANE SMITH : Cover
up for heroin.


320
0:15:16,47 --> 0:15:16,95
SHANE SMITH : Wow.


321
0:15:16,95 --> 0:15:17,9
IMMANUEL NAGBE: So
a big business.


322
0:15:17,9 --> 0:15:20,3
SHANE SMITH: We heard stories
that during the war, the


323
0:15:20,3 --> 0:15:23,22
rebels would go out in boats
with diamonds and trade the


324
0:15:23,22 --> 0:15:26,8
diamonds for weapons and
cocaine, and there was a lot


325
0:15:26,8 --> 0:15:29,92
of Colombians and Mexicans.


326
0:15:29,92 --> 0:15:32,29
SHANE SMITH: We find it
interesting because cocaine


327
0:15:32,29 --> 0:15:34,46
and heroin are very expensive
drugs, and so we were


328
0:15:34,46 --> 0:15:35,75
surprised to find heroin here.


329
0:15:35,75 --> 0:15:39,54
Usually in poorer countries,
there's speed or meth or


330
0:15:39,54 --> 0:15:41,14
things you can make.


331
0:15:41,14 --> 0:15:44,28
SHANE SMITH: Why is that?

SHANE SMITH: So how
much is that?

0:18:29,45 --> 0:18:36,785



364
0:18:36,785 --> 0:18:39,15
SHANE SMITH : The legacy of
civil war in Liberia is


365
0:18:39,15 --> 0:18:40,66
staggering.


366
0:18:40,66 --> 0:18:42,86
It's the fourth-poorest
country in the world.


367
0:18:42,86 --> 0:18:47,11
50% of the country is
illiterate, 70% of the female

population has been raped,
80% of the population is


369
0:18:51,9 --> 0:18:54,27

percentage of the population


370

0:19:32,46 --> 0:19:34,27
SHANE SMITH : Now one of the
warlords responsible for these

atrocities, who fought in all

378
0:19:37,53 --> 0:19:40,42
named General Rambo, who we
picked up at a market.


379
0:19:40,42 --> 0:19:43,25
He said, I'll talk to you if
you take me to the old


380
0:19:43,25 --> 0:19:46,12
headquarters of the rebel
factions outside of town.


381

384
0:19:56,16 --> 0:19:56,6
SHANE SMITH : Because
of the war.


385
0:19:56,6 --> 0:19:57,305
GENERAL RAMBO : When
the war came.


386
0:19:57,305 --> 0:19:58,555
SHANE SMITH : Yeah.


387
0:19:58,555 --> 0:20:28,94



388
0:20:28,94 --> 0:20:29,37
SHANE SMITH : Yeah.


389
0:20:29,37 --> 0:20:30,62
GENERAL RAMBO: Yes,
it happened.


390
0:20:30,62 --> 0:20:42,87



391
0:20:42,87 --> 0:20:44,59
SHANE SMITH: So you were one
of the ones that came in to


392
0:20:44,59 --> 0:20:45,33
take out Taylor?


393
0:20:45,33 --> 0:20:46,6
GENERAL RAMBO: Yes.


394
0:20:46,6 --> 0:20:48,24
SHANE SMITH : And then, at one
point, the American government


395
0:20:48,24 --> 0:20:50,84
came to try to get you
to go to Iraq?


396
0:20:50,84 --> 0:20:58,9



397
0:20:58,9 --> 0:21:0,24
SHANE SMITH: Yeah.

399
0:21:4,68 --> 0:21:5,93
SHANE SMITH: American.

0:21:5,93 --> 0:21:12,995



401
0:21:12,995 --> 0:21:15,61
SHANE SMITH : Yeah.


402
0:21:15,61 --> 0:21:18,1
And so when there was Iraq,
it was like, OK, let's go.


403
0:21:18,1 --> 0:21:19,39
We can help.


404
0:21:19,39 --> 0:21:22,45
So what happened?


405
0:21:22,45 --> 0:21:23,85
SHANE SMITH : The government
wouldn't let you go?


406
0:21:23,85 --> 0:21:26,64



407
0:21:26,64 --> 0:21:28,94
SHANE SMITH: Do you think it's
a problem that you have all


408
0:21:28,94 --> 0:21:31,91
these ex-combatants who grew
up fighting-- you fought in


409
0:21:31,91 --> 0:21:33,8

saying is, there's still

0:22:55,73 --> 0:22:59,37
plenty of guns in Liberia, and
him, or someone like him, can


430
0:22:59,37 --> 0:23:2,52

if the UN leaves, and

we did an article in Vice

Naked Versus the Tupac Army,"


443
0:23:41,74 --> 0:23:44,62
about a particularly fierce
Liberian warlord called Butt

child soldiers fought naked,

0:23:47,94 --> 0:23:49,73
and they were cannibals.


446
0:23:49,73 --> 0:23:52,29
So we asked Rambo if he knew him
by chance, and he said, in


447
0:23:52,29 --> 0:23:54,76
fact, we're from the same
tribe, I know him well.

0:23:54,76 --> 0:23:57,9
He promised to set up an
