###3 i don't even want to cut down that branch..that other thing unless we can move it somewhere
###9 but we're going to cut that branch down. Jacque and Roxanne appear to be resting up
###15 and recovering from lecturing about 7 months abroad. Sorry to the people in Canada for
###20 the last few lectures that had to be canceled. Also anyone out there that is able to do transcribing
###28 for some of the talks if you could contact me we'd be very grateful for that if you could
###33 send me an email. This talk Jacque gave August 12, 2010 and I'll be uploading over the next
###40 few days in parts.
###42 Jacque - We're talking about investigating the nature of human behavior. I think that
###54 what might help, is if you go back in time and take some primitive people, when I say
###62 primitive I mean like outlined districts, headhunters of the Amazon. If you open a watch
###71 and show them the back mechanism, they can't say how complex how beautifully machined.
###79 They can't do that, you understand why? anyone got a problem with that?
###81 hold on, this video's not on. It's on camera.
###82 Yeah, press record.
###82 Roxanne - Yeah I thought you had done that, sorry, yeah ok go ahead Jacque
###91 Jacque - You gotta listen to every word because they can't do it. Now, if a psychologist wants
###104 to know how the brain works. (Say or neurologist, what it does have you move your fingers?)
###111 and pick up what area of the brain is active. You understand? Then thinking, solving problems
###118 so they can map out what area becomes active. That's all they can do. But they can't tell
###126 you if it's right wrong good or bad. They can map out areas of the brain by hitting
###133 your knee and getting - picking up electronic signals, from different parts of the brain,
###138 you can map out the brain. But that doesn't tell you how the brain works. Do you understand
###150 that up to now. Ok. There are many people who try to study the mind, you can't study
###155 the mind. It's like taking primitive technology, way back a hundred years ago, giving them
###165 a transistor, saying 'what is it?' - they can't say what it is. They don't know what
###171 a transistor is. They don't know what a capacitor is. They don't know what a vacuum tube is.
###177 So alls they can do is cut it. Now if you bring a chemist in, he can tell you what comprises
###185 a transistor - certain amount of magnesium, silicone - you know what i mean? But he can't
###191 tell you what it is. Is that real clear? Studying the brain does not tell you anything about
###197 it. You have to study the brain's reaction in relation to the environment. The brain
###204 is a responding mechanism. When you shine a bright light in the eye it responds. So
###210 you can say, this is how much of a response, how little a response, But you can't tell
###216 what it is. Studying the brain gives you nothing, unless you study it in relationship to the
###223 environment. A bird with wings can't fly where there's no air, and it'll stop flying if you
###231 can put an oxygen mask on the bird and he'll flap his wings and he won't get off the ground,
###237 he wont even try to fly after a while. Only with air there will he move. You understand?
###245 Now if you beat down one wing with more pressure, you turn the wing into the wind, and beat
###253 down, he'll bank. A bird does not know how to fly instinctively. He beats his wings different
###261 ways and if it gets him to where he wants to go (by turning down?) he moves forward.
###267 If he turns it this way he stops in midair, if he's a humming bird. So the bird responds
###274  - studying the bird you have to study the environment the bird lives in. Do you understand
###280 that? There's no way you can dissect the brain and say this is what a mans like, except in
###287 context of the environment. Is that real clear? So, if I wanna study human behavior, what
###298 i'm really studying is the reactions of human beings in a given environment. I can't study
###306 human behavior, I can study their reactions. When somethings hot they move away from it.
###312 When it's cold they might move toward it, it all depends. If a man goes down to the
###319 river and he reaches for it, he usually can't get it. If he hits it with a club its faster
###327 than his hand reaction, he might catch fish that way, clubbing them. So what you can do
###336  - The primitive brain doesn't look any different. If you have a billion associations with boo
###342 boo, a bunch of metaphysical stuff, billions of associations, they are (calming?) because
###351 you believe somebody who gave you those associations to know what they're talking about. You don't
###357 even have to know what they're talking about, if the chief says something it's so. If the
###363 king says something it's so. If a politician says something its so. Right now they're concerned
###369 with foreclosures on banks. They're concerned with giving banks money, and the banks didn't
###376 use that money for the purpose intended. So they have words like fraud. You can't do anything
###384 that way, you have to take in the whole picture and ask, what is it that you want? So I have
###394 drawings of different cities, those cities have an end goal they're not just cities.
###401 The goals of those cities are to make things relevant to people that they respond to. There's
###409 no other way. Now people that live in the city, have many different reactions to the
###416 city - 'it's my home, my grandfather was born there - my favorite city' but they really
###422 don't understand what a city is, what it serves. Now they use words like shelter, home is a
###430 shelter, but when you wear a diving suit and you go underwater, thats a closed environment,
###440 shelter for underwater living. If a man goes out into space he brings with him the air
###447 in his suit and in that suit he has all kinds of equipment he may need on that mission.
###456 If you give him a book, a novel to take out into space, it's dead weight, it doesn't serve
###462 anything. If you give him an emergency book of what to do, when oxygen stops or something
###468 goes wrong, that's something. But a book about how seminal indians treat fish, would have
###476 no use in space. Our society is loaded with 'how seminal Indians treat fish'. there's
###484 lots of superfluous information superfluous to the needs of people. Must everything be
###491 scientific? If it is not it's less valid. Is there a place for none scientific? By none
###501 scientific do you mean, speculative notions? or scientific is 'I don't know, let's try
###509 to find out' does it mean you'll find out? Not necessarily. You'll find out if you have
###516 the appropriate needs, so you can't ask 'what is the brain?' Or 'how does it work?' except
###525 for context of the situation. I think there's some animals that respond to largeness. A
###535 bear when he stands up, he doesn't try to impress you with his size when he stands up,
###542 he stands up and if you react he just stands up again. But it's not 'I'm going stand up
###548 so i'll look bigger, so I'll scare the guy' a bear doesn't think that way. The neurologist
###555 that wants to study human behavior is brought up to believe in free will to start with so
###562 he's already jammed. He's already hurt, 'cause he can't look at anything objectively there's
###569 no such thing. He can only write down when a man see's lava if he sticks his finger
###577 in it burns he stays away from it. He can only do that. Now the chemist wants to know
###582 what lava is. He says 'there's so much magnesium, so much melted rock' but he still puts a label
###589 on it he calls it ‘lava’. That means a word used assigned to something. If a person misbehaves
###598 or behaves very badly, or behavior unrelated to the situation, like I've seen a kid get
###606 run over by a car and the mother says 'he can't be dead he must be alive. He can't be
###614 dead' - meaning the situation is unacceptable. She's responding more on a feeling tone rather
###621 than relevant. Sometimes of you like somebody and die immediately you say 'he can't be dead
###629 he was just (old?) having a bowl of oatmeal' you know? so, you can't do that. You can only
###635 say that 'I didn't expect that' or 'highly improbable, I thought it was anyway.' You
###649 can only talk about your relationship so, if you meet with a person and say, I'm going
###652 to exaggerate here, they have a thousand neural associations y'know? In the brain, and then
###660 you meet a person with forty thousand associations, when you talk there's more response. Less
###666 response with less associations do you understand that? If a person's very simple he says 'god
###677 wanted it that way that's why it's that way'  - well that doesn't tell you a damn thing
###679 except that persons reaction. Using reason does not work unless you equip them with the
###688 tools of reason. Now there are no tools of reason except specific tools of reason - how
###695 to fly a kite, how to build a wheel - that's specific reason. But general reasoning, can
###703 not be imparted to people particularly like things the way they are, meaning if their
###711 reactions are very simple. Now the reason most people behave badly or poorly is because
###719 they understand simple things. A person once said to me 'when I ask you a question I never
###726 get an answer, I get a lecture' because there are no answers. If a guy says 'why does my
###733 brother get angry all the time?' - 'because he gets angry that's why!' well that doesn't
###738 tell you anything. So you've got to remember if a persons that simple you don't have the
###747 time to fill in all that detail unless they say 'I'd like to know step by step, what made
###753 my brother get angry' that's good 'cause it shows some kind of inquiry, even if they learn
###760 the words and don't know what it means. Now you have to prove to them that most language
###768 is based upon primitive reactions like if lightning occurs a primitive might think that
###777 nature is angry, or god is angry, or the god of lightning is angry whatever they do, if
###787 they're at that level you don't want it. But if you take native children away from their
###794 parents you can bring them up to the modern world. No matter how primitive a person is,
###800 you take their babies, you can make them scientific, chemists anything, but taking an adult is
###810 jamming the whole associative system. If you bring a primitive person to an airport he
###818 does not look at the airplane in terms of the wings and the struts and the landing gear
###824 and wonder at all those components, he can't do that, he can look and grin just like you
###830 look at a tree when you're not into plant anatomy. You can't see the tree. An anatomist
###837 see's more of the tree, a plant physiologist than you do, or you may see clearer than he
###844 does, but he knows what to look for. Like whether it's the rings of the tree that tell
###850 him how old the tree is, or the width of the rings whether there was a drought or flood
###857 at that time, he has learned to read, or she has learned to read nature. When I say there's
###864 no such thing as human nature, there's human reactions to the environment. Some are relevant
###870 some are completely irrelevant, knowing the difference, the guy says 'why did you beat
###877 the hell out of your kid?' he's way off the subject, the guy might say 'my kid didn't
###885 listen to me' that isn't the answer, it's the whole story, you know what i mean? so
###892 when normal people - normal meaning having simpler reactions, you can't discuss human
###899 nature with them 'cause they have a fixed notion already of what human nature is - some
###905 inborn propensities or characteristics that are passed on generation after generation.
###913 And if behavior were fixed we'd still be living in caves.
