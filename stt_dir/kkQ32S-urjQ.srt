1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:17,62



2
0:0:17,62 --> 0:0:19,26
SUROOSH ALVI: The next morning,
we joined the police


3
0:0:19,26 --> 0:0:22,41
on a raid of Orangi Town, an
area reported to be a popular


4
0:0:22,41 --> 0:0:25,36
hideout for the Taliban.


5
0:0:25,36 --> 0:0:27,8
As Americans have escalated
drone attacks in the tribal


6
0:0:27,8 --> 0:0:29,96
areas, the Taliban
have increasingly


7
0:0:29,96 --> 0:0:31,37
moved to the cities.


8
0:0:31,37 --> 0:0:35,24
And Karachi, with its huge
Afghan refugee population, is


9
0:0:35,24 --> 0:0:36,765
the perfect place to blend in.


10
0:0:36,765 --> 0:0:38,15
CHAUDRY ASLAM: [SPEAKING URDU]


11
0:0:38,15 --> 0:1:2,16



12
0:1:2,16 --> 0:1:3,62
SUROOSH ALVI: Now, I'll admit
that I don't know a lot about


13
0:1:3,62 --> 0:1:6,37
police tactics, but I couldn't
help but notice that this


14
0:1:6,37 --> 0:1:8,97
operation lacked the element
of surprise.


15
0:1:8,97 --> 0:1:11,47
You've got hundreds of police
officers with sirens blaring,


16
0:1:11,47 --> 0:1:14,18
and again, every television
crew in town.


17
0:1:14,18 --> 0:1:15,99
None of the cops seemed too
worried about walking into a


18
0:1:15,99 --> 0:1:20,48
potential showdown with some
of America's most wanted.


19
0:1:20,48 --> 0:1:22,66
It wasn't quite the crack team
we were expecting to be


20
0:1:22,66 --> 0:1:24,3
conducting this kind
of operation.


21
0:1:24,3 --> 0:1:31,66



22
0:1:31,66 --> 0:1:34,19
Deputy Tariq Malik was
designated as our official


23
0:1:34,19 --> 0:1:36,53
tour guide for the operation.


24
0:1:36,53 --> 0:1:38,3
TARIQ MALIK: [SPEAKING URDU]


25
0:1:38,3 --> 0:1:54,5



26
0:1:54,5 --> 0:1:55,31
SUROOSH ALVI: So I feel like I'm
on the set of a cop movie


27
0:1:55,31 --> 0:1:58,86
right now, the kind of buffoon
cops that nobody


28
0:1:58,86 --> 0:1:59,6
wants to work with.


29
0:1:59,6 --> 0:2:1,39
They get the shitty
assignment.


30
0:2:1,39 --> 0:2:4,24
So we headed it into the back
alleys of Orangi Town to find


31
0:2:4,24 --> 0:2:7,23
some Taliban, Sunni extremists,
or any other kind


32
0:2:7,23 --> 0:2:10,7
of bad guy that was still dumb
enough to be there after 300


33
0:2:10,7 --> 0:2:13,99
members of Karachi's finest
came rolling through.


34
0:2:13,99 --> 0:2:18,64
So this is predominantly an
Afghani and Mehsud tribe


35
0:2:18,64 --> 0:2:19,61
neighborhood.


36
0:2:19,61 --> 0:2:24,8
Here is a 4.5 million person
slum that you can't control.


37
0:2:24,8 --> 0:2:26,61
So when the Taliban want to
hide-- when things are going


38
0:2:26,61 --> 0:2:28,98
too hot in the tribal areas-
they'll come to a place like


39
0:2:28,98 --> 0:2:32,32
this and blend right in and
no one knows they're here.


40
0:2:32,32 --> 0:2:33,7
Jihadis--


41
0:2:33,7 --> 0:2:34,39
that's what they're
hunting for--


42
0:2:34,39 --> 0:2:35,64
the new gang in town.


43
0:2:35,64 --> 0:2:38,78



44
0:2:38,78 --> 0:2:40,86
Our friend, Deputy Malik, seemed
more interested in


45
0:2:40,86 --> 0:2:43,35
texting than catching Taliban.


46
0:2:43,35 --> 0:2:45,33
Do you think anyone
will shoot at us?


47
0:2:45,33 --> 0:2:45,65
TARIQ MALIK: Eh?


48
0:2:45,65 --> 0:2:46,61
SUROOSH ALVI: Will anyone
shoot at us?


49
0:2:46,61 --> 0:2:47,14
TARIQ MALIK: Yeah.


50
0:2:47,14 --> 0:2:47,875
SUROOSH ALVI: Will they shoot?


51
0:2:47,875 --> 0:2:48,17
TARIQ MALIK: Yeah.


52
0:2:48,17 --> 0:2:48,89
[INAUDIBLE].


53
0:2:48,89 --> 0:2:51,24
SUROOSH ALVI: OK.


54
0:2:51,24 --> 0:2:51,95
SUROOSH ALVI: We'll fight back.


55
0:2:51,95 --> 0:2:52,58
OK.


56
0:2:52,58 --> 0:2:53,52
You'll protect Jason?


57
0:2:53,52 --> 0:2:53,75
TARIQ MALIK: Yeah, yeah,


58
0:2:53,75 --> 0:2:54,88
SUROOSH ALVI: OK, good.


59
0:2:54,88 --> 0:2:56,39
I'm responsible for him.


60
0:2:56,39 --> 0:2:58,41
TARIQ MALIK: Yeah,
[INAUDIBLE].


61
0:2:58,41 --> 0:3:0,43
We are responsible.


62
0:3:0,43 --> 0:3:2,28
SUROOSH ALVI: The cops stopped
and searched the first vaguely


63
0:3:2,28 --> 0:3:5,56
religious looking guy they saw,
only to come up empty.


64
0:3:5,56 --> 0:3:6,81
So we continued on.


65
0:3:6,81 --> 0:3:13,988



66
0:3:13,988 --> 0:3:16,42
We're going house
by house now.


67
0:3:16,42 --> 0:3:17,23
MALE SPEAKER: This guy
in the white has his


68
0:3:17,23 --> 0:3:18,5
finger on the trigger.


69
0:3:18,5 --> 0:3:18,99
SUROOSH ALVI: Yeah, I know.


70
0:3:18,99 --> 0:3:19,48
I know.


71
0:3:19,48 --> 0:3:21,6
He actually seems serious about
this whole thing, which


72
0:3:21,6 --> 0:3:24,57
makes me think that they might
actually pull some criminals


73
0:3:24,57 --> 0:3:26,48
out of this.


74
0:3:26,48 --> 0:3:28,23
They can't not with
all this weeding.


75
0:3:28,23 --> 0:3:30,84



76
0:3:30,84 --> 0:3:33,46
But then I started thinking,
what if we do run into some


77
0:3:33,46 --> 0:3:36,16
hardcore Taliban and
shit hits the fan?


78
0:3:36,16 --> 0:3:38,18
How am I going to explain
this to Jason's mom?


79
0:3:38,18 --> 0:3:42,56
I'm sorry, Mrs. Movica, but your
son, he was shot while


80
0:3:42,56 --> 0:3:45,36
embedded with the Karachi
police force.


81
0:3:45,36 --> 0:3:49,59
He was hunting down
Sunni extremists.


82
0:3:49,59 --> 0:3:52,165
Just another day
at the office.


83
0:3:52,165 --> 0:3:53,72
I was beginning to
figure out Deputy


84
0:3:53,72 --> 0:3:55,77
Malik's policing strategy--


85
0:3:55,77 --> 0:3:57,2
no camera left behind.


86
0:3:57,2 --> 0:3:59,95



87
0:3:59,95 --> 0:4:1,69
SUROOSH ALVI: I mean,
this is a pure show.


88
0:4:1,69 --> 0:4:7,196
This is pure media cop show for
all the networks tonight.


89
0:4:7,196 --> 0:4:10,105
When I go on these shoots,
I don't want to end up


90
0:4:10,105 --> 0:4:12,16
surrounded by guns,
it just happens.


91
0:4:12,16 --> 0:4:14,62
Why are there so many
dudes with guns in


92
0:4:14,62 --> 0:4:16,486
everything we film?


93
0:4:16,486 --> 0:4:18,149
How do you know when you
find the Taliban?


94
0:4:18,149 --> 0:4:25,15



95
0:4:25,15 --> 0:4:26,23
SUROOSH ALVI: Right.


96
0:4:26,23 --> 0:4:27,67
And what are you looking
for right now?


97
0:4:27,67 --> 0:4:30,5
Those specific Taliban
members?


98
0:4:30,5 --> 0:4:34,74



99
0:4:34,74 --> 0:4:35,13
SUROOSH ALVI: Killers.


100
0:4:35,13 --> 0:4:37,25
You're looking for
the killers.


101
0:4:37,25 --> 0:4:37,742
SUROOSH ALVI: And then
what are you going


102
0:4:37,742 --> 0:4:40,22
to do with the killers?


103
0:4:40,22 --> 0:4:40,95
SUROOSH ALVI: When you
find them, you're


104
0:4:40,95 --> 0:4:42,2
going to arrest them?


105
0:4:42,2 --> 0:4:45,74



106
0:4:45,74 --> 0:4:46,99
SUROOSH ALVI: Of
the kidnappers.


107
0:4:46,99 --> 0:4:50,76



108
0:4:50,76 --> 0:4:53,52
We continued waltzing through
Orangi Town, looking for


109
0:4:53,52 --> 0:4:57,14
"killer type peoples." And
then they found him--


110
0:4:57,14 --> 0:5:0,1
straight out of Central Casting,
a proper suspected


111
0:5:0,1 --> 0:5:2,15
Taliban member, turban
and all.


112
0:5:2,15 --> 0:5:5,63



113
0:5:5,63 --> 0:5:7,39
SUROOSH ALVI: Deputy Malik
was like a proud papa.


114
0:5:7,39 --> 0:5:10,48



115
0:5:10,48 --> 0:5:11,73
TARIQ MALIK: [SPEAKING URDU]


116
0:5:11,73 --> 0:5:19,56



117
0:5:19,56 --> 0:5:21,89
SUROOSH ALVI: The media were
happy, so the cops were happy,


118
0:5:21,89 --> 0:5:24,782
and they called it a day with
one nine millimeter pistol and


119
0:5:24,782 --> 0:5:26,805
a guy in a turban safely
off the streets.


120
0:5:26,805 --> 0:5:31,79



121
0:5:31,79 --> 0:5:33,4
SUROOSH ALVI: [SPEAKING URDU]


122
0:5:33,4 --> 0:5:35,7



123
0:5:35,7 --> 0:5:38,55
MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING URDU]


124
0:5:38,55 --> 0:5:39,8
SUROOSH ALVI: [SPEAKING URDU]


125
0:5:39,8 --> 0:5:42,41



126
0:5:42,41 --> 0:5:45,63
MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING URDU]


127
0:5:45,63 --> 0:5:47,88
SUROOSH ALVI: Some guns that
they confiscated from the old


128
0:5:47,88 --> 0:5:49,74
guy that looked like he might
have been in the Taliban.


129
0:5:49,74 --> 0:5:51,4
I highly doubt he was
in the Taliban.


130
0:5:51,4 --> 0:5:52,665
MALE SPEAKER: Did you see
how that happened?


131
0:5:52,665 --> 0:5:53,15
SUROOSH ALVI: Yeah.


132
0:5:53,15 --> 0:5:53,995
He was smiling.


133
0:5:53,995 --> 0:5:55,39
He was smiling a bit.


134
0:5:55,39 --> 0:5:57,546
MALE SPEAKER: That
was all set up?


135
0:5:57,546 --> 0:5:58,796
SUROOSH ALVI: Yep.


136
0:5:58,796 --> 0:6:0,95



137
0:6:0,95 --> 0:6:3,78
MALE SPEAKER: All the kind of
mocking of the situation


138
0:6:3,78 --> 0:6:6,16
aside, this is a really
dangerous neighborhood.


139
0:6:6,16 --> 0:6:8,81



140
0:6:8,81 --> 0:6:10,1
SUROOSH ALVI: Yeah, exactly.


141
0:6:10,1 --> 0:6:12,85
Watching what was supposed to be
a sensitive anti-terrorist


142
0:6:12,85 --> 0:6:15,85
operation get turned into a
media circus, I couldn't help


143
0:6:15,85 --> 0:6:18,12
but think that it was no wonder
the US didn't want to


144
0:6:18,12 --> 0:6:21,2
involve the Pakistanis in the
raid on Bin Laden's compound.


145
0:6:21,2 --> 0:6:24,7
It would have been broadcast
on live television, and Bin


146
0:6:24,7 --> 0:6:27,14
Laden would have vanished into
thin air, kind of like any


147
0:6:27,14 --> 0:6:29,605
actual Taliban that may have
been in Orangi Town.


148
0:6:29,605 --> 0:6:34,68



149
0:6:34,68 --> 0:6:36,13
Ugh.


150
0:6:36,13 --> 0:6:38,31
The gangsters, when they kidnap
people, this is where


151
0:6:38,31 --> 0:6:42,57
they come and keep them, because
no one would come out


152
0:6:42,57 --> 0:6:44,53
here to look for
them, because--


153
0:6:44,53 --> 0:6:45,12
I mean, why would they?


154
0:6:45,12 --> 0:6:46,37
It's brutal.


155
0:6:46,37 --> 0:6:49,44



156
0:6:49,44 --> 0:6:50,69
MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING URDU]


157
0:6:50,69 --> 0:8:50,69
