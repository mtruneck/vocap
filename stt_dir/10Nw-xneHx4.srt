1
0:0:0,209 --> 0:0:4,399
the prosecution of bradley many
continues uh... his court marshal is of


2
0:0:4,399 --> 0:0:5,16
course


3
0:0:5,16 --> 0:0:9,299
proceeding in june uh... they will be
going to court


4
0:0:9,299 --> 0:0:13,159
today bradley many did something very
unusual did what is called the naked


5
0:0:13,159 --> 0:0:14,249
plea


6
0:0:14,249 --> 0:0:17,499
meaning that he did not reach a plea
agreement with the prosecution


7
0:0:17,499 --> 0:0:19,81
nonetheless he is agreed


8
0:0:19,81 --> 0:0:23,739
to uh... plead guilty on some of the
lesser charges


9
0:0:23,739 --> 0:0:27,67
so you pled guilty to misusing
classified material


10
0:0:27,67 --> 0:0:32,36
overall with ten of the lesser charges
that he pled guilty to any now


11
0:0:32,36 --> 0:0:35,33
faces a maximum of uh...


12
0:0:35,33 --> 0:0:39,51
twenty years in prison because of that
position of those charges carries


13
0:0:39,51 --> 0:0:43,61
and maximum both two years now when he
did this


14
0:0:43,61 --> 0:0:47,83
he read a thirty five page statement in
court that he had written himself


15
0:0:47,83 --> 0:0:50,8
and it appears that he did that


16
0:0:50,8 --> 0:0:52,18
because he's saying look


17
0:0:52,18 --> 0:0:53,85
this is a reality


18
0:0:53,85 --> 0:0:56,5
i did it because i thought it would help
the country


19
0:0:56,5 --> 0:0:59,68
and it was me and i did give it to
weaken leaks


20
0:0:59,68 --> 0:1:4,67
but well other charges like aiding the
enemy are absurd i didn't do that


21
0:1:4,67 --> 0:1:7,3
and i will fight that


22
0:1:7,3 --> 0:1:11,47
as a strategy in the defense i don't
know a lot of people are concerned


23
0:1:11,47 --> 0:1:15,83
uh... you it's giving away some of your
leverage in some way


24
0:1:15,83 --> 0:1:17,69
on the other hand


25
0:1:17,69 --> 0:1:22,74
manning continues to be a man of
tremendous principle


26
0:1:22,74 --> 0:1:26,36
i don't know anybody else who comes and
says look


27
0:1:26,36 --> 0:1:29,74
uh... pleading to this cuz i did


28
0:1:29,74 --> 0:1:33,12
and it's not going to give me any
advantage in my trial 'cause the


29
0:1:33,12 --> 0:1:34,77
prosecution continues


30
0:1:34,77 --> 0:1:35,93
snot like


31
0:1:35,93 --> 0:1:38,63
prolific all well he's being honest


32
0:1:38,63 --> 0:1:41,299
so will let 'em off don't they don't
care the whole reason they're


33
0:1:41,299 --> 0:1:42,27
prosecuting him


34
0:1:42,27 --> 0:1:44,2
is because he was honest


35
0:1:44,2 --> 0:1:46,17
right and they're trying to set an
example with them


36
0:1:46,17 --> 0:1:47,139
so they're gonna try


37
0:1:47,139 --> 0:1:50,24
it appears for a life sentence anyway


38
0:1:50,24 --> 0:1:53,83
but the man as usual is true his
principles


39
0:1:53,83 --> 0:1:58,5
and we found out some other interesting
things from his uh... testimony today


40
0:1:58,5 --> 0:2:0,88
first of all it turns out that he
actually


41
0:2:0,88 --> 0:2:4,34
uh... contacted the washington post in
the new york times and try to give them


42
0:2:4,34 --> 0:2:5,77
the story first


43
0:2:5,77 --> 0:2:7,66
so that's amazing


44
0:2:7,66 --> 0:2:12,189
neither of those papers were interested
in what turned out to be


45
0:2:12,189 --> 0:2:15,49
one of the biggest stories of a
generation


46
0:2:15,49 --> 0:2:20,369
and his story so gigantic there try to
put this guy awake for a life


47
0:2:20,369 --> 0:2:24,669
and and they're doing their national
manhunt basically enjoyin assigns 'cause


48
0:2:24,669 --> 0:2:27,65
he didn't carry this torch that's how
much government cares about it


49
0:2:27,65 --> 0:2:32,29
the new york times larger post like that


50
0:2:32,29 --> 0:2:33,809
and i'll tell you why in a second but


51
0:2:33,809 --> 0:2:38,989
here's what the guardian reports about
his interaction with the washington post


52
0:2:38,989 --> 0:2:41,29
quoting contact in the washington post


53
0:2:41,29 --> 0:2:44,36
and asked would it be interested in
receiving information


54
0:2:44,36 --> 0:2:45,469
he said would be in


55
0:2:45,469 --> 0:2:49,93
norma sli important to the american
people


56
0:2:49,93 --> 0:2:53,89
and their answer was i'm not really


57
0:2:53,89 --> 0:2:54,509
now y


58
0:2:54,509 --> 0:2:56,819
is it because they look at the
information they were scared us that are


59
0:2:56,819 --> 0:2:58,49
now in a nana


60
0:2:58,49 --> 0:3:0,929
that in person the wife impose


61
0:3:0,929 --> 0:3:4,499
uh... have to check with my senior
editors and we'll get back to you and


62
0:3:4,499 --> 0:3:5,819
was dismissive


63
0:3:5,819 --> 0:3:9,29
the new york times he left voice mail
messages skype messages


64
0:3:9,29 --> 0:3:12,49
on many different reporters editors et
cetera


65
0:3:12,49 --> 0:3:15,799
none of them either return his call


66
0:3:15,799 --> 0:3:18,799
because he's not an important person


67
0:3:18,799 --> 0:3:19,859
you see


68
0:3:19,859 --> 0:3:23,39
our media so he used to being fed
information by the government


69
0:3:23,39 --> 0:3:25,209
that is pro-government


70
0:3:25,209 --> 0:3:28,849
and it could be pro republican report
about democrat to depending on who's


71
0:3:28,849 --> 0:3:30,459
leaking information


72
0:3:30,459 --> 0:3:31,769
that they do


73
0:3:31,769 --> 0:3:34,34
but that's not only legitimate source of
information


74
0:3:34,34 --> 0:3:38,419
well if i have a high esteem government
official give me a


75
0:3:38,419 --> 0:3:41,49
press releases that is the skies as my


76
0:3:41,49 --> 0:3:42,25
you know article


77
0:3:42,25 --> 0:3:44,89
then of course i shot the return of talk
radio lee


78
0:3:44,89 --> 0:3:46,119
on this guy


79
0:3:46,119 --> 0:3:48,69
has a treasure trove


80
0:3:48,69 --> 0:3:50,46
of incredibly important government
information


81
0:3:50,46 --> 0:3:51,4
specialists


82
0:3:51,4 --> 0:3:54,29
for example in their past helicopter
video


83
0:3:54,29 --> 0:3:54,86
that week


84
0:3:54,86 --> 0:3:55,789
murdered


85
0:3:55,789 --> 0:3:57,699
civilians children


86
0:3:57,699 --> 0:4:0,449
and reporters we killed two workers
reporters


87
0:4:0,449 --> 0:4:2,249
you'll find that to be interesting news


88
0:4:2,249 --> 0:4:3,519
no it doesn't matter


89
0:4:3,519 --> 0:4:5,499
cousin on important person


90
0:4:5,499 --> 0:4:8,9
and so i'm not gonna take notes from you


91
0:4:8,9 --> 0:4:10,659
i'm i'm gonna ignore your permission


92
0:4:10,659 --> 0:4:12,129
horrible reporting


93
0:4:12,129 --> 0:4:13,859
horrible journalism


94
0:4:13,859 --> 0:4:18,519
so that's why he had to go to with unix
'cause await your weeks was only people


95
0:4:18,519 --> 0:4:20,479
journalism business at the time


96
0:4:20,479 --> 0:4:23,399
born people actually cared about
information that would expose of the


97
0:4:23,399 --> 0:4:25,499
government was doing


98
0:4:25,499 --> 0:4:26,849
that's why the rest of


99
0:4:26,849 --> 0:4:28,259
the so-called journalist


100
0:4:28,259 --> 0:4:31,15
or soul insanely jealous


101
0:4:31,15 --> 0:4:32,539
of julian assigned


102
0:4:32,539 --> 0:4:35,629
and try to from one of the bus that
every opportunity


103
0:4:35,629 --> 0:4:38,19
okay now why did manning do it


104
0:4:38,19 --> 0:4:39,889
starting continues to explain


105
0:4:39,889 --> 0:4:42,5
referring to the warlords from iraq and
afghanistan


106
0:4:42,5 --> 0:4:46,34
he said he felt they would reveal the
true cost award


107
0:4:46,34 --> 0:4:49,68
now does that sound like a guy who's
trying to keep the enemy


108
0:4:49,68 --> 0:4:53,36
cells where you guys were stranded the
the u_s_ public


109
0:4:53,36 --> 0:4:56,37
in understanding neutral cost the war


110
0:4:56,37 --> 0:4:58,689
so that we can make an informed decision


111
0:4:58,689 --> 0:5:1,67
on whether we stay in iraq whether we
stay in afghanistan


112
0:5:1,67 --> 0:5:3,9
so that we know what our governments
actually do it


113
0:5:3,9 --> 0:5:8,47
them asinine as we killed in afghanistan
what we're doing diplomatically and by


114
0:5:8,47 --> 0:5:12,6
the way some of those diplomatic cables
anne released change the world there


115
0:5:12,6 --> 0:5:17,33
were part of what led to the revolutions
in tunisia and egypt by the way the new


116
0:5:17,33 --> 0:5:19,2
york times the washington post


117
0:5:19,2 --> 0:5:20,479
all those world changing


118
0:5:20,479 --> 0:5:24,18
documents not that important cuz you're
not an important person who usually


119
0:5:24,18 --> 0:5:29,9
feeds me crap from the government rally
many explained in his all the worse


120
0:5:29,9 --> 0:5:32,93
we were obsessed with capturing and
killing human targets are lists


121
0:5:32,93 --> 0:5:35,5
and ignoring goals admissions


122
0:5:35,5 --> 0:5:38,709
i believe that the public particularly
the american public


123
0:5:38,709 --> 0:5:41,9
concede this because spark a debate on
the military


124
0:5:41,9 --> 0:5:43,82
an art form policy in general


125
0:5:43,82 --> 0:5:46,529
as it applied iraq and afghanistan


126
0:5:46,529 --> 0:5:51,449
it may cause society do we considered
the meeting gauging counter-terrorism


127
0:5:51,449 --> 0:5:57,809
well ignoring the human situation of the
people we need to use with everyday


128
0:5:57,809 --> 0:6:0,929
you know who says something like that


129
0:6:0,929 --> 0:6:2,899
whistleblower


130
0:6:2,899 --> 0:6:8,539
that someone who's trying to help the
enemy someone who's trying to help us


131
0:6:8,539 --> 0:6:13,59
he is that classic definition of a
whistle-blower


132
0:6:13,59 --> 0:6:15,69
and he was right


133
0:6:15,69 --> 0:6:18,39
we did kill those civilians in that
helicopter attack


134
0:6:18,39 --> 0:6:20,639
we didn't kill those reporters


135
0:6:20,639 --> 0:6:24,699
report number civilians lead killed in
iraq and afghanistan


136
0:6:24,699 --> 0:6:25,799
accurately


137
0:6:25,799 --> 0:6:27,939
he was right about it all


138
0:6:27,939 --> 0:6:31,809
and we would have been better off had we
known that every permeation earlier


139
0:6:31,809 --> 0:6:35,929
we're better off knowing about what's
also veto songs egypt as all the rest of


140
0:6:35,929 --> 0:6:37,289
the world


141
0:6:37,289 --> 0:6:40,33
but for that in america you do not get
rewarded


142
0:6:40,33 --> 0:6:42,909
you get sent the president


143
0:6:42,909 --> 0:6:47,39
so because of his own admissions is now
facing a maximum of twenty years at


144
0:6:47,39 --> 0:6:50,98
least but the government immigrate blood
lust here


145
0:6:50,98 --> 0:6:54,5
to put away someone who's actually
trying to help our democracy


146
0:6:54,5 --> 0:6:56,479
says it's not enough


147
0:6:56,479 --> 0:6:58,9
it's not enough


148
0:6:58,9 --> 0:6:59,639
we wanna life sentence


149
0:6:59,639 --> 0:7:1,65
and the thing that they want most of all


150
0:7:1,65 --> 0:7:3,949
is a one day it would connect many


151
0:7:3,949 --> 0:7:5,809
to julian assigns


152
0:7:5,809 --> 0:7:8,229
so they can go get him to


153
0:7:8,229 --> 0:7:12,119
because we had a rare moment of
journalism break out here


154
0:7:12,119 --> 0:7:14,8
and what happened at the soviet and know
what i government


155
0:7:14,8 --> 0:7:16,5
is actually doing


156
0:7:16,5 --> 0:7:18,139
in our so-called democracy


157
0:7:18,139 --> 0:7:19,819
and that is what the government


158
0:7:19,819 --> 0:7:22,79
isn't live in and out


159
0:7:22,79 --> 0:7:23,99
that's why they want on issue than a


160
0:7:23,99 --> 0:7:27,27
to the health and that's why would they
want to go get it signs


161
0:7:27,27 --> 0:7:30,409
and try to put him away for life too


162
0:7:30,409 --> 0:7:31,55
it's sick


163
0:7:31,55 --> 0:7:34,29
we should all be against it


164
0:7:34,29 --> 0:9:34,29
and we should free bradley many as soon
is humanly possible
