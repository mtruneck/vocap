###19 DANNY BOWIEN: I'll be the first to admit that I had no
###20 idea what I was getting myself into when I started this.
###23 I mean, I'm Korean, and I'm making Chinese food.
###27 Where's that big platter at?
###28 I never cooked Chinese food until last year, so it's
###32 pretty crazy.
###33 
###50 They raised the fucking price of the two for Tuesday.
###54 It's $1.29 now, which is fucking bullshit.
###56 My name's Danny Bowien, and I'm the cook.
###60 Not the only cook, but a cook at Mission Chinese Food.
###64 A cook's life is really hard.
###66 I mean, you basically do it because you're passionate
###69 about something, not because you want to make money.
###71 And so I was really tired of working at these restaurants
###74 and making for people I couldn't connect
###75 to in a lot of ways.
###77 And none of my friends could come eat at the restaurant
###79 that I worked at, because they either didn't want to or they
###81 couldn't afford it.
###81 I wanted to be able to make food for people that I
###83 could relate to.
###85 
###87 The owners of the restaurant owned this
###89 restaurant for 10 years.
###90 It's never been busy, and they were fine with that, because
###92 they owned the building.
###93 They just had this as kind of like a hang out.
###95 We're kind of renting the space off from them.
###97 And then with Mission Chinese Food, we were like, well,
###99 let's just do this together, and we'll find a
###101 way to make it work.
###102 Who bought milk?
###104 Whose gallon of milk is this?
###105 -Nobody bought milk.
###107 DANNY BOWIEN: Why did anybody-- no
###107 Asians can drink milk!
###109 -It's good milk.
###110 It's good milk.
###113 DANNY BOWIEN: So we're at the Commonwealth.
###115 We're picking up Yin, one of my really good friends, and on
###118 our days off, we would always eat Chinese food together.
###121 High five.
###121 Pound the beer.
###122 -High five.
###122 Pound the beer.
###123 Let's go.
###125 DANNY BOWIEN: The Commonwealth is kind of the sister
###127 restaurant of Mission Chinese Food.
###130 It's a young man's game, beer pounding.
###132 All right.
###133 We've gotta go.
###135 Before I actually started working in a Chinese
###137 restaurant, all my cook friends, we would all just go
###139 out and eat Chinese food on our day off.
###141 Because when you make fancy food all the time, you don't
###144 feel like eating fancy food on your day off.
###145 It's cool.
###146 Now all my friends work at fancy restaurants, and I work
###148 at a shitty Chinese restaurant.
###150 So we're going to Bar Agricole right now.
###152 One of my best friends in the world, Brandon
###155 Jew, is a chef there.
###156 To be honest, he's the reason that I started
###158 making Chinese food.
###160 But he's Chinese.
###161 I think his dream still is to make Chinese food.
###162 
###171 Dude, so spice is over--
###172 [INTERPOSING VOICES]
###174 IAN MUNTZERT: Oh, what the fuck you got?
###174 Oh, tiny pastries.
###176 BRANDON JEW: Yeah, try this.
###178 DANNY BOWIEN: Why are you eating this?
###179 We're about to go eat fucking spicy Chinese food.
###182 You're crazy!
###183 Dude, it's so good.
###185 BRANDON JEW: Hey, have you had the coppa di testa here yet?
###186 DANNY BOWIEN: No.
###186 BRANDON JEW: I have some, yeah.
###188 You want some?
###188 DANNY BOWIEN: Shut the fuck up.
###189 We have to hurry, though.
###190 That place closes soon.
###191 He makes awesome charcuterie.
###193 BRANDON JEW: Here's the snout right here.
###194 DANNY BOWIEN: Nice!
###195 IAN MUNTZERT: That's gnarly as fuck.
###198 DANNY BOWIEN: So this is like the--
###199 BRANDON JEW: Ears, you put the tenderloin in there and the
###201 cheeks, and that's the tongue.
###202 DANNY BOWIEN: That's what I eat late at night.
###203 Before I go home, I eat this.
###205 BRANDON JEW: We call it rotolo di testa.
###207 It means a roll of head.
###212 It's melting, so we've gotta eat it now.
###214 DANNY BOWIEN: Yeah, eat it fast.
###215 Let's crush this, and then we should go.
###217 
###224 What's your favorite thing in SPiCES?
###226 IAN MUNTZERT: The fucking pork.
###227 DANNY BOWIEN: Really?
###227 IAN MUNTZERT: Oh, fuck.
###229 And they send you like the whole motherfucking shoulder.
###232 DANNY BOWIEN: Don't really haul balls.
###233 I was joking.
###234 It's called SPiCES Szechuan Trenz, with a Z.
###239 IAN MUNTZERT: It's kind of made up to look like a really
###240 shitty Taiwanese nightclub.
###241 
###246 DANNY BOWIEN: I think the good thing about going to eat
###247 Chinese food is that the more people you have, the better,
###250 because you can order more stuff.
###252 All right, what are you gonna get?
###253 IAN MUNTZERT: I'm gonna get the pork shoulder and garlic
###255 sauce, and the dry braised eel strips.
###258 DANNY BOWIEN: You wanna get the spicy beef tendon?
###259 You guys are so quiet, so that's a no.
###261 BRANDON JEW: Yeah.
###262 DANNY BOWIEN: What's your favorite thing here?
###265 DANNY BOWIEN: I'll get that.
###265 These guys are wusses.
###266 BRANDON JEW: No, I don't want that.
###268 DANNY BOWIEN: You're crazy!
###269 It's so good.
###270 It's very crispy.
###271 Right?
###274 DANNY BOWIEN: Oh, never mind.
###275 I like the crispy ones.
###276 
###289 IAN MUNTZERT: The cumin lamb's fucking retarded good.
###291 
###294 BRANDON JEW: I like their [INAUDIBLE] better.
###296 DANNY BOWIEN: So this thing is ridiculous.
###299 When have you had this before?
###300 BRANDON JEW: Every time that I've been here--
###302 DANNY BOWIEN: That's crazy.
###303 BRANDON JEW: --since the first time.
###305 DANNY BOWIEN: I don't wanna mess with it, it's so awesome.
###307 BRANDON JEW: Look at this [INAUDIBLE].
###309 DANNY BOWIEN: It's crazy, man.
###310 It's so nuts.
###311 BRANDON JEW: I'm at a loss for words right now.
###314 DANNY BOWIEN: This thing is no joke, my friend.
###316 This is no joke.
###317 
###321 Oh, this is a blood thing.
###323 BRANDON JEW: Yeah.
###323 DANNY BOWIEN: Your favorite.
###324 I'm stoked, I'm excited.
###325 IAN MUNTZERT: Go ahead and put it right in front of me.
###327 DANNY BOWIEN: No, if it's your favorite, I'm
###327 excited to try it.
###329 I'm excited.
###329 BRANDON JEW: Good.
###331 DANNY BOWIEN: I'll eat a blood.
###332 The intestine's good.
###335 I love this place, because I came here the first time, and
###338 I'd never had food like this before, ever.
###340 Like, ever, ever, ever.
###342 I'd never had Szechuan food before.
###343 I mean, I grew up in Oklahoman, and I ate, like, a
###345 lot of sweet and sour chicken, and fried rice, and lo mein.
###349 But this is what really opened my eyes to making
###351 stuff that's different.
###352 Every time I come here, I find out about something else that
###354 I've never had before.
###355 Like, this thing is ridiculous.
###356 I've never had this before.
###358 I have no chef telling me what to do.
###359 I know how to do whatever cooking I know, and then you
###362 come here, and you taste and taste and taste, and you're
###365 like, how did they do that?
###366 And then you just try to make it as good as--
###369 Just as good as, and if it's better, then it's better.
###371 But just as good as.
###371 BRANDON JEW: The thing about Danny is, it's crazy, because
###374 he can take--
###375 you just need to taste something, and he can start
###378 recreating it.
###379 And then he'll start dorking out about it.
###381 He'll be like, hey, come over and try this shit.
###385 I got this idea from this so-and-so place.
###388 And then, all of a sudden, you're eating it, and it
###391 tastes even better than the original version.
###393 DANNY BOWIEN: No.
###394 BRANDON JEW: It does.
###394 DANNY BOWIEN: That's arguable.
###396 BRANDON JEW: My frustration with Chinese food was that no
###398 one was making it better.
###400 Like, David Chang was making Korean food better in New
###403 York, and Charles Phan was doing that with Vietnamese
###405 food out here.
###407 But no one was taking the torch for Chinese food, and as
###410 a Chinese American, that was my whole frustration was like,
###415 no one's taking the torch.
###416 I don't know.
###416 I'm just stoked that someone is doing Chinese food.
###419 DANNY BOWIEN: We're getting all bromance over here.
###421 IAN MUNTZERT: I think the reason that your cooking is
###425 something more unique and more interesting is that you take
###428 this role of beginner's mindset to it.
###429 You know that you don't know what you're doing.
###432 DANNY BOWIEN: I have no idea.
###432 IAN MUNTZERT: And you're just trying to make something good.
###434 Whereas, like, everybody here is so steeped in tradition
###438 that they're just going to make it the way they've been
###440 told to do, and they're going to care in varying degrees.
###442 BRANDON JEW: Yeah, you're not playing that role.
###444 
###452 DANNY BOWIEN: We're going back to the restaurant right now,
###454 and we're going to make a late night snack.
###460 IAN MUNTZERT: Because we're all starving.
###462 DANNY BOWIEN: I could eat more.
###463 
###474 -How's your dins?
###475 -[INAUDIBLE]
###477 DANNY BOWIEN: Oh my God, dude.
###480 It's starting to get kind of nuts, just so you know.
###482 The real question is gonna be, whose hand gets
###484 fucking bitten off?
###485 IAN MUNTZERT: Hold on, why are we not throwing these things
###487 into fucking boiling water?
###489 We need boiling water.
###490 Why the fuck are we cutting these things up alive?
###491 DANNY BOWIEN: Because it's salt and pepper crab.
###492 Ian, shut up.
###493 
###495 I'm so drunk.
###496 You're not drunk.
###497 It's not fair.
###498 -I've been drinking waiting for you.
###500 DANNY BOWIEN: All right, sorry, sorry, sorry.
###502 I think people are gonna be stoked.
###504 IAN MUNTZERT: All right, let me clean one of these fuckers,
###505 because I've never done this alive.
###507 Oh, dude, I got the livest crab here.
###509 It does not want to die.
###510 It does not want to-- oh!
###513 Oh.
###514 BRANDON JEW: Flip him over and give him a nap.
###516 IAN MUNTZERT: Fuck him, I'm not giving him a nap!
###519 DANNY BOWIEN: You're just going for the gold!
###521 IAN MUNTZERT: Oh, it's a lot harder when it's raw, man.
###524 DANNY BOWIEN: Pull the gills, pop the back.
###526 I don't know what I did.
###527 IAN MUNTZERT: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
###528 From here, I got it.
###529 The little fucker.
###530 I got it, I got it, I got it.
###532 DANNY BOWIEN: Don't cut your hand off.
###533 This is where you cut your hand.
###535 IAN MUNTZERT: I'm not cutting my fucking hand off.
###536 DANNY BOWIEN: This is where drunken cooking goes wrong.
###537 IAN MUNTZERT: Oh, no, I'm familiar with--
###539 oh, really?
###539 Oh, no!
###542 BRANDON JEW: Stop him!
###543 DANNY BOWIEN: Ian, stop.
###544 You're eating that one.
###546 IAN MUNTZERT: Fine, I'll eat this one.
###546 We're throwing it in a fucking wok.
###548 -Face before tail.
###550 IAN MUNTZERT: After I ripped its dick off, it
###552 fucking cut me, dude.
###553 
###559 DANNY BOWIEN: I don't even remember cooking anything last
###561 night, but we cooked a bunch of crazy food.
###565 Let's chop these crabs, then, huh?
###568 What is with all these Slim Jims over here?
###570 I feel like we're just doing what we want to do.
###573 When you're able to just have 100% creative freedom, and do
###576 what you want to do, that comes across and you can
###579 connect to people.
###580 
###584 IAN MUNTZERT: Fuck yes.
###585 BRANDON JEW: Danny Bowein.
###586 DANNY BOWIEN: Wait, you have to wait for this.
###587 This is the salt and pepper dungeness crab
###589 with mapo tofu sauce.
###591 Eew!
###594 Shut your mouth.
###596 We'll see where it goes, you know?
###597 I don't think I'm going to be making Chinese food when I'm
###599 45 or anything like that.
###601 We'll see.
###602 The dream was, like, oh, I just want to work at a
###604 restaurant where I cook what I want to eat on my day off, and
###606 that was was what this was.
###607 And it still is, but now I kind of want salads.
###612 Greg, pound a beer.
###615 Tonight?
###616 I feel like it turned out awesome.
###618 All right, guys, thanks for coming.
###621 Good night.
