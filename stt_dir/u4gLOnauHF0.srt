0:0:2,22 --> 0:0:4,75
CHARLET DUBOC: On top of having
to organize a fashion


3
0:0:4,75 --> 0:0:7,88
week, Billy Bad Ass had just
become a father for the second


4
0:0:7,88 --> 0:0:10,7
time and was spending
the morning taking


5
0:0:10,7 --> 0:0:12,18
his newborn son home.


6
0:0:12,18 --> 0:0:15,96
So to kill time, we decided to
explore one of our favorite


7
0:0:15,96 --> 0:0:17,61
Atlanta urban legends.


8
0:0:17,61 --> 0:0:20,28
We went to meet the guy
responsible for the face


9
0:0:20,28 --> 0:0:23,605
tattoo which catapulted Gucci
Mane to viral fame.


10
0:0:23,605 --> 0:0:26,82



11
0:0:26,82 --> 0:0:29,4
So Shane, what happened
that day?


12
0:0:29,4 --> 0:0:31,65
SHANE WILLOUGHBY: He had quite
a few tattoos on his face.


13
0:0:31,65 --> 0:0:35,55
And he felt that some of the
ones around his eyes made him


14
0:0:35,55 --> 0:0:37,2
look like he had a black eye.


15
0:0:37,2 --> 0:0:41,6
And he wanted a tattoo that
took away from those.


16
0:0:41,6 --> 0:0:43,74
I was like, I couldn't
really suggest


17
0:0:43,74 --> 0:0:46,1
anything for your face.


18
0:0:46,1 --> 0:0:47,86
He was like, well,
what about this?


19
0:0:47,86 --> 0:0:51,14
And he unzipped his hoodie, and
he had the largest piece


20
0:0:51,14 --> 0:0:52,16
of jewelry I've ever seen.


21
0:0:52,16 --> 0:0:54,87
This large ice cream cone
medallion that was just


22
0:0:54,87 --> 0:0:56,16
covered in diamonds.


23
0:0:56,16 --> 0:0:57,66
And I was like, OK.


24
0:0:57,66 --> 0:0:59,81
I think I could put something
together.


25
0:0:59,81 --> 0:1:1,267
Here's the stencil right here.


26
0:1:1,267 --> 0:1:2,4
CHARLET DUBOC: [GASP]


27
0:1:2,4 --> 0:1:3,64
Oh my god.


28
0:1:3,64 --> 0:1:5,71
SHANE WILLOUGHBY: One day I'll
get around to framing it.


29
0:1:5,71 --> 0:1:6,96
CHARLET DUBOC: Let me imagine.


30
0:1:6,96 --> 0:1:9,55



31
0:1:9,55 --> 0:1:10,8
No way!


32
0:1:10,8 --> 0:1:13,44
SHANE WILLOUGHBY: He said, I
want it to be rock and roll.


33
0:1:13,44 --> 0:1:17,32
And so that's where the
lightning bolts came from.


34
0:1:17,32 --> 0:1:18,61
CHARLET DUBOC: And
with the Brrr.


35
0:1:18,61 --> 0:1:19,47
SHANE WILLOUGHBY: That
was kind of funny.


36
0:1:19,47 --> 0:1:23,12
I see a lot of people stating
how I misspelled that.


37
0:1:23,12 --> 0:1:25,53
And it's kind of funny.


38
0:1:25,53 --> 0:1:26,2
CHARLET DUBOC: It's
not a word.


39
0:1:26,2 --> 0:1:26,79
SHANE WILLOUGHBY: Yeah.


40
0:1:26,79 --> 0:1:28,4
It's a sound.


41
0:1:28,4 --> 0:1:30,9
CHARLET DUBOC: What happened
at work the next day?


42
0:1:30,9 --> 0:1:33,24
SHANE WILLOUGHBY: The phone
ringing off the hook.


43
0:1:33,24 --> 0:1:35,83
Hip hop radio stations
calling.


44
0:1:35,83 --> 0:1:39,69
After misquotes got out, I
no longer really wanted


45
0:1:39,69 --> 0:1:40,71
to talk about it.


46
0:1:40,71 --> 0:1:42,58
CHARLET DUBOC: What about the
actual tattooing process?


47
0:1:42,58 --> 0:1:45,42
Was he a hard man or was
he a bit of a pussy?


48
0:1:45,42 --> 0:1:47,125
SHANE WILLOUGHBY: It's almost
like he was asleep.


49
0:1:47,125 --> 0:1:47,59
CHARLET DUBOC: Really.


50
0:1:47,59 --> 0:1:48,98
SHANE WILLOUGHBY: Yeah, he
didn't move, didn't make a


51
0:1:48,98 --> 0:1:51,44
sound, unless we were talking.


52
0:1:51,44 --> 0:1:53,415
CHARLET DUBOC: Have you found
that there have been more


53
0:1:53,415 --> 0:1:55,45
rappers getting tattoos?


54
0:1:55,45 --> 0:1:55,45
Is it a lot more popular?


55
0:1:55,45 --> 0:1:57,34
SHANE WILLOUGHBY: Oh, yes.


56
0:1:57,34 --> 0:2:2,31
It's gone from rappers having
the little forearm tattoos to


57
0:2:2,31 --> 0:2:5,69
being fully covered.


58
0:2:5,69 --> 0:2:8,49
Tattooing in Atlanta, no matter
where you tattoo-- if


59
0:2:8,49 --> 0:2:10,87
you tattoo in Atlanta, you're
an urban tattooer.


60
0:2:10,87 --> 0:2:13,32
CHARLET DUBOC: What's been your
weirdest tattoo request


61
0:2:13,32 --> 0:2:16,78
in your career?


62
0:2:16,78 --> 0:2:20,515
SHANE WILLOUGHBY: A penis on a
lady in her 50s, lower back.


63
0:2:20,515 --> 0:2:21,766
[MUSIC PLAYING]


64
0:2:21,766 --> 0:2:24,2
CHARLET DUBOC: And with that
charming image in mind, we


65
0:2:24,2 --> 0:2:26,78
said goodbye to Shane and
went to meet Billy.


66
0:2:26,78 --> 0:2:29,49



67
0:2:29,49 --> 0:2:31,48
We've come out to the
suburbs of Atlanta.


68
0:2:31,48 --> 0:2:32,53
This is where Billy lives.


69
0:2:32,53 --> 0:2:36,16
He's invited us to his house,
which is really nice


70
0:2:36,16 --> 0:2:37,71
considering the circumstances.


71
0:2:37,71 --> 0:2:40,74
He's got a 48-hour-old
baby in there.


72
0:2:40,74 --> 0:2:43,94
He's invited us to come and
see where he works from.


73
0:2:43,94 --> 0:2:46,32
And then I think the plan is
that we're going to the local


74
0:2:46,32 --> 0:2:49,15
car dealership to maybe
buy a Range Rover.


75
0:2:49,15 --> 0:2:51,85



76
0:2:51,85 --> 0:2:53,5
BILLY BAD ASS: Hello.


77
0:2:53,5 --> 0:2:53,33
Hey.


78
0:2:53,33 --> 0:2:55,16
What's happening?


79
0:2:55,16 --> 0:2:57,414
CHARLET DUBOC: I don't want
to wake the baby.


80
0:2:57,414 --> 0:2:58,39
BILLY BAD ASS: Come on in.


81
0:2:58,39 --> 0:3:0,83
Come on.


82
0:3:0,83 --> 0:3:2,42
My war room-- this
is my war room.


83
0:3:2,42 --> 0:3:3,52
My treadmill.


84
0:3:3,52 --> 0:3:4,16
CHARLET DUBOC: Your war room?


85
0:3:4,16 --> 0:3:5,18
BILLY BAD ASS: Yeah.


86
0:3:5,18 --> 0:3:7,86
I put my information
of my events--


87
0:3:7,86 --> 0:3:10,47
what city I'm going to.


88
0:3:10,47 --> 0:3:14,28
Information I need,
like locations.


89
0:3:14,28 --> 0:3:16,18
They gave me an award.


90
0:3:16,18 --> 0:3:19,82
I'm a pioneer in urban fashion,
and they felt like


91
0:3:19,82 --> 0:3:21,95
they needed to give me something
for my outstanding


92
0:3:21,95 --> 0:3:23,1
achievement.


93
0:3:23,1 --> 0:3:24,62
CHARLET DUBOC: You're
a fashion pioneer?


94
0:3:24,62 --> 0:3:26,31
BILLY BAD ASS: Yes.


95
0:3:26,31 --> 0:3:28,57
CHARLET DUBOC: Despite the
disorganized appearance of the


96
0:3:28,57 --> 0:3:32,5
war room, Billy was keen to
share some of his theories on


97
0:3:32,5 --> 0:3:34,62
achieving success.


98
0:3:34,62 --> 0:3:36,63
What was the book you were
telling me about yesterday?


99
0:3:36,63 --> 0:3:37,405
"Who Moved the Cheese?"


100
0:3:37,405 --> 0:3:38,59
BILLY BAD ASS: "Who Moved
the Cheese?" This


101
0:3:38,59 --> 0:3:39,735
was about two rats.


102
0:3:39,735 --> 0:3:43,4
They call them Hem and Haw
and Skip and Scurry.


103
0:3:43,4 --> 0:3:45,3
They had a maze--
it was a maze.


104
0:3:45,3 --> 0:3:48,45
Hem and Haw went in first
and went around.


105
0:3:48,45 --> 0:3:51,62
And they didn't see any cheese,
so they came back out.


106
0:3:51,62 --> 0:3:54,44
Well, Skip and Scurry went
in and kept going.


107
0:3:54,44 --> 0:3:55,31
And they looked, and they
didn't see nothing.


108
0:3:55,31 --> 0:3:56,135
They kept going all the way.


109
0:3:56,135 --> 0:3:58,22
And then they found cheese.


110
0:3:58,22 --> 0:3:59,995
So Hem and Haw was like,
they in there.


111
0:3:59,995 --> 0:4:0,916
They must have found
some cheese.


112
0:4:0,916 --> 0:4:3,83
So they went and found
the cheese where


113
0:4:3,83 --> 0:4:4,935
Skip and Scurry was.


114
0:4:4,935 --> 0:4:6,79
And after a while, the
cheese ran out.


115
0:4:6,79 --> 0:4:8,17
There was no more cheese.


116
0:4:8,17 --> 0:4:10,88
So what Skip and Scurry did--


117
0:4:10,88 --> 0:4:13,97
they went further in and
looked for more cheese.


118
0:4:13,97 --> 0:4:15,88
And it took them
a little while.


119
0:4:15,88 --> 0:4:16,73
They kept going.


120
0:4:16,73 --> 0:4:17,72
They found more cheese.


121
0:4:17,72 --> 0:4:21,339
But the moral of the story was
that the cheese might run out.


122
0:4:21,339 --> 0:4:22,16
So what do you do?


123
0:4:22,16 --> 0:4:24,71
Are you going to sit around and
wait for more cheese in


124
0:4:24,71 --> 0:4:27,64
the same area, or are you going
to find another solution


125
0:4:27,64 --> 0:4:29,24
to solving a problem?


126
0:4:29,24 --> 0:4:31,92
HAW: What will happen if the
cheese isn't here tomorrow?


127
0:4:31,92 --> 0:4:35,5
I've made plans based
on this cheese!


128
0:4:35,5 --> 0:4:37,39
CHARLET DUBOC: It was clear that
Billy had every intention


129
0:4:37,39 --> 0:4:39,42
of chasing the cheese.


130
0:4:39,42 --> 0:4:42,19
Maybe that was part of the
reason behind taking his Urban


131
0:4:42,19 --> 0:4:43,95
Fashion Week on the road--


132
0:4:43,95 --> 0:4:46,65
to find some exotic
foreign cheese.


133
0:4:46,65 --> 0:4:50,29
Some Stilton, perhaps.


134
0:4:50,29 --> 0:4:52,94
However, in my experience,
putting on a fashion week


135
0:4:52,94 --> 0:4:54,26
takes some work.


136
0:4:54,26 --> 0:4:57,1
And I'd yet to see examples of
the clothes, designers, and


137
0:4:57,1 --> 0:5:1,47
crew that are usually a
requirement for such an event.


138
0:5:1,47 --> 0:5:3,95
Billy assured me that this
was all in hand.


139
0:5:3,95 --> 0:5:6,22
But first there were more
pressing issues


140
0:5:6,22 --> 0:5:7,27
to take care of.


141
0:5:7,27 --> 0:5:13,21
[MUSIC PLAYING]


142
0:5:13,21 --> 0:5:14,53
CHARLET DUBOC: So where
are we going?


143
0:5:14,53 --> 0:5:16,35
BILLY BAD ASS: We're going
to a dealership.


144
0:5:16,35 --> 0:5:18,755
I've been looking at some
cars I want to get.


145
0:5:18,755 --> 0:5:20,8
CHARLET DUBOC: And what
car do you want?


146
0:5:20,8 --> 0:5:23,6
BILLY BAD ASS: I want
a Range Rover.


147
0:5:23,6 --> 0:5:24,4
CHARLET DUBOC: Cool.


148
0:5:24,4 --> 0:5:26,28
BILLY BAD ASS: Isn't that
an English car?


149
0:5:26,28 --> 0:5:26,98
CHARLET DUBOC: Yeah.


150
0:5:26,98 --> 0:5:31,19
People who drive Range Rovers
really are like wealthy white


151
0:5:31,19 --> 0:5:32,98
women with kids.


152
0:5:32,98 --> 0:5:35,6
BILLY BAD ASS: [LAUGHS]


153
0:5:35,6 --> 0:5:36,98
CHARLET DUBOC: It's
funny, right?


154
0:5:36,98 --> 0:5:38,23
BILLY BAD ASS: That's
hilarious.


155
0:5:38,23 --> 0:5:43,29



156
0:5:43,29 --> 0:5:46,18
Yeah, the guy that we need to
meet is not there right now.


157
0:5:46,18 --> 0:5:48,55
So we're going to come back.


158
0:5:48,55 --> 0:5:51,87
I don't know if you remember
Holyfield, the boxer?


159
0:5:51,87 --> 0:5:54,1
Well, he's being sued.


160
0:5:54,1 --> 0:5:59,11
The car that I'm getting ready
to buy was his car.


161
0:5:59,11 --> 0:6:1,19
He's a celebrity.


162
0:6:1,19 --> 0:6:3,12
I'd like to have the car.


163
0:6:3,12 --> 0:6:7,388
It just reminds me of how
he was at his prime.


164
0:6:7,388 --> 0:6:9,49
[MUSIC PLAYING]


165
0:6:9,49 --> 0:6:11,74
CHARLET DUBOC: Listening to
Billy talk of his aspirations


166
0:6:11,74 --> 0:6:15,41
to buy the repossessed car of
a broke boxer didn't seem to


167
0:6:15,41 --> 0:6:19,22
fit with the cheese-chasing
philosophy.


168
0:6:19,22 --> 0:6:23,3
So little time and London
creeping ever closer.


169
0:6:23,3 --> 0:6:26,55
However, Billy was unfazed, and
wanted to take us to one


170
0:6:26,55 --> 0:6:30,11
of Atlanta's high end urban
fashion boutiques, as he said


171
0:6:30,11 --> 0:6:32,54
it would give us an idea of what
we could expect to see on


172
0:6:32,54 --> 0:6:35,247
the catwalk at London
Urban Fashion Week.


173
0:6:35,247 --> 0:6:36,5
[MUSIC PLAYING]


174
0:6:36,5 --> 0:6:36,95
BILLY BAD ASS: How you doing?


175
0:6:36,95 --> 0:6:37,442
-What's up?


176
0:6:37,442 --> 0:6:38,92
BILLY BAD ASS: All right.


177
0:6:38,92 --> 0:6:40,11
I've just told them
about your store.


178
0:6:40,11 --> 0:6:43,27
You do a lot of celebrities in
the market, so I just want to


179
0:6:43,27 --> 0:6:45,53
make sure I give
you some love.


180
0:6:45,53 --> 0:6:46,4
-No problem.


181
0:6:46,4 --> 0:6:46,76
Definitely.


182
0:6:46,76 --> 0:6:47,91
Welcome to Moda404.


183
0:6:47,91 --> 0:6:49,59
BILLY BAD ASS: What are the
price points on those up


184
0:6:49,59 --> 0:6:50,1
there?


185
0:6:50,1 --> 0:6:51,24
-$695 for these.


186
0:6:51,24 --> 0:6:53,44
BILLY BAD ASS: Those are like
boss glasses right there.


187
0:6:53,44 --> 0:6:57,202
When you wear those, you
know you a boss.


188
0:6:57,202 --> 0:6:58,72
What are the price
point on these?


189
0:6:58,72 --> 0:7:1,214
-This pair is actually
$595, I believe.


190
0:7:1,214 --> 0:7:2,634
BILLY BAD ASS: What's the price
point on something like


191
0:7:2,634 --> 0:7:2,822
that?


192
0:7:2,822 --> 0:7:5,51
-This one here is $425.


193
0:7:5,51 --> 0:7:8,51
BILLY BAD ASS: I just met this
gentleman named Quincy.


194
0:7:8,51 --> 0:7:11,11
He's got a lot of core urban
luxury, and I do


195
0:7:11,11 --> 0:7:12,64
Urban Fashion Week.


196
0:7:12,64 --> 0:7:15,36
This was a great fit.


197
0:7:15,36 --> 0:7:17,3
-Urban luxury, to me,
is basically--


198
0:7:17,3 --> 0:7:18,92
the hip hop community, once
they make it to a certain


199
0:7:18,92 --> 0:7:21,31
level, then they feel
like they have to


200
0:7:21,31 --> 0:7:22,8
dress a certain way.


201
0:7:22,8 --> 0:7:25,4
But you do have those guys that
just don't break code.


202
0:7:25,4 --> 0:7:27,26
They still going to
wear T-shirts.


203
0:7:27,26 --> 0:7:29,375
They going to jump out of
Maserati wearing T-shirts.


204
0:7:29,375 --> 0:7:32,35
They're going to wear Levi's.


205
0:7:32,35 --> 0:7:35,46
But they still going to have
$400,000 worth of jewelry on.


206
0:7:35,46 --> 0:7:36,2
It's urban luxury--


207
0:7:36,2 --> 0:7:38,941
what we consider luxury
in the hood.


208
0:7:38,941 --> 0:7:39,58
BILLY BAD ASS: Well, listen.


209
0:7:39,58 --> 0:7:43,4
How many shirts you
going to give me?


210
0:7:43,4 --> 0:7:44,674
-When people use the term
"urban," to be quite honest


211
0:7:44,674 --> 0:7:46,27
with you, I take
offense to it.


212
0:7:46,27 --> 0:7:49,116
It's such a stereotype as far as
fashion, because fashion to


213
0:7:49,116 --> 0:7:50,16
me is worldwide.


214
0:7:50,16 --> 0:7:51,74
CHARLET DUBOC: Is there
anything that's become


215
0:7:51,74 --> 0:7:55,68
fashionable in the Atlanta
hip hop community that


216
0:7:55,68 --> 0:7:57,36
you think, oh god.


217
0:7:57,36 --> 0:7:58,95
You don't really like.


218
0:7:58,95 --> 0:8:3,85
-When guys wear their suits with
the tag on the sleeve.


219
0:8:3,85 --> 0:8:6,96
And then the butt implants
on the ladies' side.


220
0:8:6,96 --> 0:8:9,54
Atlanta is really notorious
for their strip club.


221
0:8:9,54 --> 0:8:10,91
And also--


222
0:8:10,91 --> 0:8:11,66
yeah.


223
0:8:11,66 --> 0:8:15,39
It's definitely a show
when you go out.


224
0:8:15,39 --> 0:8:17,69
CHARLET DUBOC: Atlanta strip
clubs are heavily referenced


225
0:8:17,69 --> 0:8:21,15
in countless hip hop songs, to
the extent that stripping has


226
0:8:21,15 --> 0:8:23,5
become a covetable
career choice for


227
0:8:23,5 --> 0:8:24,28
young women of Atlanta.


228
0:8:24,28 --> 0:8:28,11
Something to aspire to rather
than a last resort, which is


229
0:8:28,11 --> 0:8:30,79
so often the case elsewhere
in the world.


230
0:8:30,79 --> 0:8:39,24
-[RAPPING - FUTURE, "MAGIC"]


231
0:8:39,24 --> 0:8:42,47
CHARLET DUBOC: We headed to the
Vatican of strip clubs--


232
0:8:42,47 --> 0:8:43,529
Magic City--


233
0:8:43,529 --> 0:8:45,53
to talk to some of the
girls about pussy


234
0:8:45,53 --> 0:8:46,913
popping on the handstand.


235
0:8:46,913 --> 0:8:48,625
Oh, and fashion.


236
0:8:48,625 --> 0:8:52,838



237
0:8:52,838 --> 0:8:54,57
PASSION: My name is Passion.


238
0:8:54,57 --> 0:8:57,14
I just graduated from Alabama
State University.


239
0:8:57,14 --> 0:9:1,64
This magnitude of this
place helped me fund


240
0:9:1,64 --> 0:9:3,44
my way through school.


241
0:9:3,44 --> 0:9:7,14
This one individual can make
thousands of dollars just by


242
0:9:7,14 --> 0:9:9,43
taking off her clothes
and nothing else.


243
0:9:9,43 --> 0:9:11,96
She doesn't have to be smart.


244
0:9:11,96 --> 0:9:14,87
All she has to do is bend over
and shake her ass for money.


245
0:9:14,87 --> 0:9:16,12
That's freaking crazy.


246
0:9:16,12 --> 0:9:19,44



247
0:9:19,44 --> 0:9:21,27
CHARLET DUBOC: Stripping
is cool in Atlanta.


248
0:9:21,27 --> 0:9:22,58
How did that happen?


249
0:9:22,58 --> 0:9:24,745
PASSION: Big Meech, from
Detroit, well, he came in the


250
0:9:24,745 --> 0:9:28,7
clubs and he started this
make it rain era.


251
0:9:28,7 --> 0:9:29,465
Rain falling from the ceiling.


252
0:9:29,465 --> 0:9:32,29
And it just looked like it's
just trickling down.


253
0:9:32,29 --> 0:9:33,38
CHARLET DUBOC: You mean money?


254
0:9:33,38 --> 0:9:33,97
PASSION: Money, yes!


255
0:9:33,97 --> 0:9:36,183
Money just coming down.


256
0:9:36,183 --> 0:9:38,598
And he made stripping cool.


257
0:9:38,598 --> 0:9:41,496



258
0:9:41,496 --> 0:9:43,92
[MUSIC PLAYING]


259
0:9:43,92 --> 0:9:45,71
CHARLET DUBOC: Hip hop
and strip clubs


260
0:9:45,71 --> 0:9:47,15
feed off each other.


261
0:9:47,15 --> 0:9:50,1
-It's the inspiration
both ways.


262
0:9:50,1 --> 0:9:54,24
We inspirate them, I believe, as
far as what they rap about.


263
0:9:54,24 --> 0:9:56,56
Strippers poles, money,
and all that.


264
0:9:56,56 --> 0:9:58,45
And then we feed off of--
because they come in here and


265
0:9:58,45 --> 0:9:59,0
play their song.


266
0:9:59,0 --> 0:9:59,29
They throw the money.


267
0:9:59,29 --> 0:10:1,62
They actually do what their
song is talking about.


268
0:10:1,62 --> 0:10:3,16
So we enjoy each other.


269
0:10:3,16 --> 0:10:5,67
So it's back and forth.


270
0:10:5,67 --> 0:10:7,23
Motivation.


271
0:10:7,23 --> 0:10:10,9
-We still get rappers that
talk about Magic City, of


272
0:10:10,9 --> 0:10:13,12
course, in all of their songs.


273
0:10:13,12 --> 0:10:15,5
CHARLET DUBOC: Is the whole
style and expression of


274
0:10:15,5 --> 0:10:18,265
stripping filtering down
into Atlanta fashion?


275
0:10:18,265 --> 0:10:21,342
PASSION: This club is the most
flashiest club you're ever


276
0:10:21,342 --> 0:10:21,74
going to see.


277
0:10:21,74 --> 0:10:24,715
The first time I saw these
feathers and these glitter,


278
0:10:24,715 --> 0:10:27,53
glitzy bras and things
were inside here.


279
0:10:27,53 --> 0:10:30,1
And now I see women outside
of here wearing it, too.


280
0:10:30,1 --> 0:10:30,61
So, yeah.


281
0:10:30,61 --> 0:10:34,81
They are trying to imitate us.


282
0:10:34,81 --> 0:10:36,1
Maybe because they're
trying to keep their


283
0:10:36,1 --> 0:10:37,26
men a little longer.


284
0:10:37,26 --> 0:12:37,26
