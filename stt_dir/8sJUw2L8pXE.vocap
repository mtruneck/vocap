###76 POIROT: The Harlequinade.
###78 Ancestor of the English pantomime.
###80 Six characters,
###83 garish, grotesque,
###86 first brought to life
###88 three centuries ago by the clowns and the actors
###90 of the Italian fairgrounds.
###92 Today, mere costumed characters at a masked ball.
###97 Where now their mystery, their magic,
###100 their comedy...
###102 their tragedy?
###110 CRONSHAW: Ready for the party, Uncle?
###111 Well, where's your mask?
###113 It's not midnight yet, you know, Eustace.
###116 Victory Ball?
###119 You'd think the Hun would remember 1918 as well as we do.
###122 Ah, well, as Coward says,
###124 "What a pity the Hun prefers fighting to fun."
###128 Oh, what's this?
###130 Oh, Uncle Eustace, not more for your collection?
###133 Magnificent set, isn't it?
###135 Just over from Holland.
###137 And Mira's holding it for me till the end of the month.
###139 I can guess why you're telling me.
###141 Your poor uncle doesn't get 6,000 a year
###144 from the Cronshaw Estates, as you do.
###146 -- Eustace, please -- -- You know I'm cleaned out
###147 after the figurines.
###148 This is a night for old triumphs,
###152 not for new quarrels.
###157 BELTAINE: Cronshaw.
###170 MAN: This is the National Programme.
###172 The time is 7:00.
###175 And now we present a play by Desmond Havelock Ellis
###178 entitled "Deadly Alibi,"
###182 starring Coco Courtney as Loretta Lampton.
###184 The late Coco Courtney, as usual.
###188 Where the hell is she?
###192 Cue them.
###194 Are you expecting Miss Lampton for dinner tonight, sir?
###198 MAN: Yes. She should be arriving in about half an hour.
###202 I believe that clock is gaining, sir.
###204 I'm quite aware of that, thank you.
###207 Will there be any other guests?
###209 No.
###210 Very good, sir.
###213 [ Telephone rings ]
###217 [ Door opens ]
###218 Good evening, Davis.
###220 I'm afraid I'm a little early.
###222 That's quite all right, miss.
###224 Bloody actresses.
###226 COURTNEY: It was such a fine night, I --
###229 Hey, is that the time?
###230 Approximately.
###232 Of course. I forgot -- it gains.
###234 Rather fun, really.
###236 You can be early and late at the same time.
###238 MAN: Oh, Letty.
###241 I wasn't expecting you till 8:00.
###243 COURTNEY: Sorry. I never realized.
###246 POIROT: Thank you, Miss Lemon.
###248 I think Captain Hastings was listening to the weather report
###252 to see whether you'd need an umbrella.
###254 Oh.
###257 This urgent package just arrived by messenger.
###261 Can I go now?
###264 Yes, of course.
###268 [ Departing footsteps ]
###274 [ Door opens ]
###275 Just one moment — Miss Lemon!
###277 Ah. I was wondering where that had got to.
###279 Apparently, we won't need an umbrella.
###281 Oh, you haven't forgotten, have you?
###285 The Victory Ball.
###286 You promised you'd try and make it.
###289 Ackerley was really looking forward to it.
###291 -- Ackerley is? -- HASTINGS: He's with the BBC.
###294 But he's quite a decent chap. Drives an Alvis.
###296 Well, unfortunately,
###297 I have to rearrange my stamps in order of size.
###300 Please convey my apologies to M. Ackerley.
###304 He'll be very disappointed.
###306 He said that meeting you
###307 is the high spot of his career.
###311 Well, that seems reasonable.
###320 BELTAINE: It's not much to ask, Cronshaw.
###323 A thousand should do it.
###325 Eustace, not now.
###327 Later.
###330 And there she is —
###331 the belle of the ball.
###333 Cronsh.
###337 Cutting it a bit fine, weren't you, Coco?
###339 I like cutting it fine. Hello, darling.
###344 Coco, you remember my uncle, the Honorable Eustace.
###347 Dishonorable, I heard.
###350 CRONSHAW: Oh, and this is Chris Davidson,
###352 one of Coco's old acting cronies.
###353 Hello.
###355 CRONSHAW: Come on, Davidson.
###356 We'd better go and rescue your wife.
###358 She's out in the taxi
###359 with a friend of Uncle's, the infamous Mrs. Mallaby.
###363 Well, about time.
###366 I was beginning to suspect Miss Courtney
###368 was having a clandestine affair with Henry Hall.
###371 And his orchestra.
###374 Good evening, Coco.
###381 Getting chilly, isn't it?
###384 BELTAINE: All aboard for the Victory Ball.
###403 They seek him here, they seek him there.
###405 Those Frenchies seek him everywhere.
###408 What do you think, Poirot?
###409 POIROT: Hastings, you look...
###413 ...incomparable.
###427 I still don't think they'll let you in.
###429 I thought I made it clear
###430 the Victory Ball was a costume do.
###432 Hercule Poirot does not wear costumes.
###434 Everybody does.
###435 The whole idea is to go as someone famous.
###437 Precisely.
###439 Oh. I see.
###467 -- James. -- Arthur.
###469 May I present M. Hercule Poirot?
###471 I'm so delighted to meet you at last.
###475 The Sheikh of Ackerley, I presume.
###477 [ Laughter ]
###487 Well, here we are, then.
###491 We eat supper first, don't we, Cronshaw?
###493 -- No, not till half past 9:00. -- Oh.
###495 Couldn't they run to a doorman in this place?
###498 We're so backward in England, Mrs. Mallaby.
###500 We still have door handles.
###502 Oh, well, pardon me for living.
###506 Oh! Sloshed already.
###510 Did I hurt you, my dear?
###511 I half expected you to shatter like a vase.
###513 -- Come along, Coco. -- It's all right.
###518 Are you all right, darling?
###521 I was so afraid I wasn't going to make it here on time,
###525 thanks to the antics of Coco Courtney.
###527 Oh, speaking of which, isn't that her up there?
###529 ACKERLEY: Oh, Lord Cronshaw's party, yes.
###534 She's talked about nothing but the costumes
###537 all through rehearsals.
###538 They're a reproduction of the old Italian comedy.
###541 The what?
###542 Ah, yes, the Commedia dell'Arte.
###544 Harlequin, the magical sprite
###545 who can become invisible, and his lover, Columbine.
###549 Punchinello and Pulcinella, the grotesques.
###552 And, ah, yes, the tragic Pierrot and Pierrette.
###557 Enchanting.
###560 I thought Lord Cronshaw was a younger man.
###563 What? Punchinello?
###565 Oh, no, no.
###566 That's his uncle, the Honorable Eustace Beltaine.
###569 He was the one who bought those rare Meissen figurines
###572 there was all that publicity about.
###575 Apparently, they provided the inspiration for the outfits.
###578 That's Cronshaw in the Harlequin suit.
###582 HASTINGS: Oh, yes.
###583 I read in the paper he's worth an absolute fortune.
###586 POIROT: And who is that lighting the cigarette
###589 of Mlle. Courtney?
###590 ACKERLEY: The Pierrot? Chris Davidson.
###592 Quite a versatile actor.
###594 And that's his wife talking to Cronshaw, I assume.
###598 The other lady is the notorious Mrs. Mallaby.
###604 Ah, yes.
###605 The American widow in search of a new victim, yes?
###611 They say she stalks the aristocracy with a net
###613 and a group of beaters.
###615 [ Laughter ]
###618 Oh, you're such a bore.
###619 ACKERLEY: They make a jolly crowd, though, don't they?
###622 Yes, indeed.
###627 And now I think it is time for a little crème de banane.
###659 Thank heavens that's over.
###661 Coco and Cronshaw are being simply appalling.
###664 Ah, there's that shyster Van Meer over there.
###666 MALLABY: Eustace, forget it.
###668 BELTAINE: He held me for ransom on the figurines,
###671 and now he wants to do the same again with that china.
###673 That's the least of our worries this evening.
###675 I'm going to corner the blighter
###676 and demand that he reduces the price.
###678 Eustace!
###681 I'm sorry.
###682 When Eustace wants something for his collection,
###685 he does rather...
###686 BELTAINE: I want to put an end to this right now!
###688 COURTNEY: For God's sake, shut up.
###690 CRONSHAW: Coco, where do you think you're going?
###692 I told you, I've had enough.
###693 Chris, get me a taxi, would you?
###694 I've got a splitting headache.
###696 Coco.
###697 It's all been decided, Cronsh.
###698 Chris is taking me home.
###699 CRONSHAW: The hell he is.
###701 You're staying right here!
###702 I am not prepared to have an argument about it.
###704 Look, why don't we all just sit down for a moment and cool off?
###707 COURTNEY: Cool off?
###708 He's already as cold as an iceberg,
###710 with me as the Titanic.
###711 [ Laughs ]
###713 What the hell do you think you're laughing at?
###716 I'm sorry.
###718 Coco, people are looking.
###720 Come along.
###721 Cronshaw, let's go back inside.
###728 HASTINGS: And yet I feel I took the podium in Josephine.
###730 [ Laughs ]
###736 M. Ackerley, do I understand that you produced
###738 a play on the radio this evening following the weather forecast?
###741 ACKERLEY: Yes.
###743 Tell me -- is not Mlle. Courtney
###745 slightly older than is usual for the part of the ingenue?
###748 A little, perhaps, but, then, that's the joy of radio.
###751 The visual appearance is all in the mind.
###754 It's amazing what we get away with sometimes.
###762 Good night.
###768 HASTINGS: What's all that about?
###770 POIROT: It would appear that Mlle. Courtney
###773 and her boyfriend, Lord Cronshaw,
###775 have had a disagreement of some kind.
###777 Just now I heard her ask M. Davidson
###779 to escort her home.
###780 Well, that's a shame.
###781 She'll miss all the fun.
###782 Well, I wondered how long it'd be
###784 before something like that happened.
###785 You are not surprised?
###787 I know actors, M. Poirot.
###789 They never know when to stop.
###791 Well, she has had her moment of drama for this evening.
###795 Let us hope it will be sufficient.
###800 He's arrogant, conceited.
###802 What's all this about, Coco?
###804 What exactly did Cronshaw say to you earlier?
###808 COURTNEY: Chris, not now.
###811 Has our taxi arrived yet?
###812 -- Your cab is waiting, sir. -- Careful.
###815 MRS. DAVIDSON: Chris?
###828 BELTAINE: We need to have this out here and now.
###830 Look, you're not a poor man.
###833 Surely you can do me this one favor.
###836 You know I'm desperate.
###848 Thanks for everything, Chris.
###850 I think I can handle it from here.
###852 It's time Cronsh realized
###853 I'm not one of his prize racehorses.
###857 CHRIS: Coco, are you sure you'll manage?
###861 I'm sure.
###862 I'd get back there if I were you.
###865 That wife of yours may look like a startled poodle,
###867 but she's no fool.
###868 I'll never make it back before midnight.
###870 Well, then, you'd better go home and wait for her.
###873 Good night, Coco.
###876 COURTNEY: Sleep tight.
###878 I always do.
###887 MAN: Have a nice evening, Miss Courtney?
###899 -- Oh! -- So sorry.
###903 Oh, thank you.
###909 M. Ackerley, I thank you.
###910 You are very kind.
###911 My pleasure.
###913 Santé.
###914 Cheers.
###919 Are you sure I can't persuade you to recount some of
###922 your juicier cases on the radio?
###924 Alas, no.
###925 You see, murder -- a real murder --
###928 is not an entertainment.
###930 Look at this place -- people dance, they laugh.
###932 But anywhere, there may be evil beneath the mask.
###935 Pardon me.
###936 I saw you across the room.
###939 Aren't you Hercule Poirot, the detective?
###942 I am indeed, Madame Mallaby.
###944 Ah!
###945 That's amazing. You worked out my name.
###948 I suppose you don't also know where Lord Cronshaw is.
###951 He's a Harlequin.
###952 He's been in a tizzy ever since supper.
###954 Alas, no.
###955 Oh.
###957 He promised me a turn on the floor before 12:00.
###961 Then, madame, you must not be disappointed.
###965 My associate, Captain Hastings, is a dancer consummate.
###969 He would be pleased to accompany you.
###971 My pleasure.
###982 Ah, look, there he is.
###985 Yoo-hoo! Viscount Cronshaw!
###993 Would you excuse me for a moment?
###995 Of course.
###1004 ACKERLEY: Been stood up, Arthur?
###1006 No title, I'm afraid.
###1008 MAN: My lords,
###1009 ladies and gentlemen, the time for
###1014 the unmasking and the victory celebrations is at hand.
###1018 [ Audience gasps and applauds ]
###1020 Twelve seconds to midnight.
###1023 Ten, nine,
###1025 eight, seven,
###1027 six, five, four,
###1031 three, two, one.
###1034 [ Cheering ]
###1038 [ Applause ]
###1039 [ Balloons pop ]
###1058 [ Screams ]
###1090 Thank you.
###1100 [ Chopin's piano music playing ]
###1110 Darling, what is it?
###1118 What's happened?
###1120 Lord Cronshaw's dead.
###1135 Inspector Japp, any comment to make?
###1137 Is it true Hercule Poirot missed the killer?
###1139 Tell us the truth, Inspector.
###1144 JAPP: Here's a fine dish of tea, Poirot.
###1146 Peer of the Realm murdered in cold blood
###1149 under the noses of 400 revelers.
###1150 We'll need the Albert Hall
###1152 to gather the suspects on this one.
###1154 Perhaps.
###1156 It is one of the table knives.
###1158 Plenty back here.
###1159 We'll check for prints, but I'll lay odds it's clean.
###1163 An instrument not very practical,
###1167 but in the right hands...
###1169 Ah, we also found this on the floor.
###1172 The Mallaby woman saw him make some sort of note
###1175 just before he died.
###1177 POIROT: Lowestoft.
###1179 Town on the east coast.
###1182 Perhaps he was planning a holiday.
###1185 I say, Poirot, look at this.
###1188 Attention, mon ami.
###1202 Monogrammed.
###1203 HASTINGS: "C" for Cronshaw.
###1205 Very nice.
###1211 Idiot!
###1212 HASTINGS: What is it?
###1213 Such foolishness!
###1216 Young people must realize that life is not to be gambled with
###1219 like the roulette wheel.
###1222 It is nothing less than poison.
###1228 Cocaine.
###1230 Would that account for his strange behavior after supper?
###1233 It's not unusual for addicts to become moody and troublesome.
###1237 He certainly seems to have put up a fight.
###1241 Why do you say that, Hastings?
###1243 Hadn't you noticed?
###1244 His fist.
###1245 It's still clenched.
###1257 C'est ça.
###1258 Well, I can't see how that helps us.
###1260 POIROT: Can you not, Chief Inspector?
###1262 Then let me enlighten you further.
###1265 Unless I am very mistaken,
###1268 there is something very important behind this curtain.
###1274 Voilà.
###1282 Well, it's just an empty recess.
###1285 POIROT: My point exactly.
###1287 One more thing, Chief Inspector.
###1289 If I were you, I should find Mlle. Coco Courtney.
###1293 -- Why? -- Ask her if
###1294 she and Lord Cronshaw had an argument.
###1305 "Murderer eludes famous detective."
###1308 Idiot.
###1310 It's a very good photo of Captain Hastings.
###1313 Indeed it is, Miss Lemon.
###1314 I'm sure no one will think less of you.
###1317 Seen the paper, Poirot? Jolly good photo of me --
###1319 Oh, you've seen it.
###1321 I'll go and sort the letters.
###1323 I wouldn't take it to heart if I were you.
###1326 No, indeed, Hastings.
###1327 For the present, it suits my purposes.
###1330 Ah.
###1332 This is what interests me.
###1334 The obituary?
###1336 Listen to this.
###1339 "The Viscount Cronshaw was chairman of many charities,
###1342 including the Widows of British Seamen
###1344 and the League Against Drug Addiction."
###1346 [ Telephone rings ]
###1347 "He is succeeded in his title and estates
###1349 by his uncle, the Honorable Eustace Beltaine."
###1351 The League Against Drug Addiction.
###1353 That's a bit hypocritical, isn't it?
###1357 You miss my point, I think, Hastings.
###1360 Mr. Poirot. Chief Inspector Japp.
###1364 Oh.
###1369 Hello?
###1370 Ah, Poirot.
###1371 We're drawing a blank at this end, I'm afraid.
###1373 Miss Courtney doesn't answer her phone,
###1375 and there's no reply at her door, either.
###1377 POIROT: I implore you to be persistent,
###1379 Chief Inspector Japp.
###1380 I am now even more convinced that Mlle. Courtney
###1382 must be located with all possible speed.
###1384 Right.
###1389 Mlle. Courtney is proving elusive.
###1393 HASTINGS: Probably sleeping the night off.
###1396 All of these theatrical types
###1397 lie in late if they haven't a performance.
###1399 But she does have a performance.
###1405 They usually perform the Friday evening play again
###1408 on Saturday morning.
###1409 My mother listens to it during her morning coffee.
###1411 COURTNEY: I do love him in a way, I suppose,
###1414 but it was never quite how I imagined it was going to be.
###1417 I suppose it never is.
###1421 But I'm staring at the clock -- why?
###1423 Come, Hastings.
###1425 We will make a trip to Broadcasting House.
###1429 MAN: Letty, what do you mean?
###1432 COURTNEY: I mean...
###1450 [ Telephone rings ]
###1453 WOMAN: "Hercules Poy-rot."
###1455 I'm afraid the variety auditions are on Tuesdays.
###1460 That is fortunate.
###1462 I am here on a matter of murder, madame.
###1464 You're the detective from the newspapers.
###1468 Correct.
###1470 Don't suppose you want to miss a second one.
###1475 COURTNEY: You were never where you said you were that night,
###1478 but here all the time.
###1479 I was such an idiot.
###1481 I never guessed it was the money you wanted.
###1483 MAN: Is that what you thought?
###1485 ACKERLEY: Luckily we took a recorded transcription
###1487 of last night's performance for the archives.
###1489 We would have had to ask one of the girls to double up parts.
###1493 Did Mlle. Courtney send to you a message this morning
###1496 to explain her absence?
###1497 Not a sausage.
###1498 Three minutes to transmission,
###1500 she still wasn't answering her phone,
###1502 so I had no choice but to use the transcription
###1504 and dismiss the other actors.
###1505 Hastings, I'm very much afraid of what has happened.
###1508 Would you please telephone the Chief Inspector Japp?
###1511 Instruct him that he must enter the apartment
###1513 of Mlle. Courtney by any means necessary.
###1515 -- Well, of course, but what -- -- Hastings, please.
###1517 This is a matter of life and death.
###1519 MAN: Very clever, Letty, but I suppose you realize
###1522 that I can't let you spill the beans.
###1524 Is there anything I can do to help?
###1525 COURTNEY: Phillip, you can't!
###1541 Fourth floor, lads.
###1553 Right, the apartment above.
###1555 Get down on the balcony.
###1556 Fast!
###1559 And don't break your necks!
###1563 POIROT: Nothing yet?
###1569 You and Mlle. Courtney are old friends, huh?
###1571 After a fashion.
###1575 She likes having people she knows around her
###1577 playing minor roles.
###1578 Coco and I go back a long way.
###1582 She was playing the lead in Rep when I landed my first part.
###1584 So you see a great deal of each other.
###1586 CHRIS: Look here, Poirot.
###1588 I'm a married man, remember?
###1589 I'm sorry, M. Davidson.
###1591 Forgive me, but... I was just trying to ascertain
###1596 whether you could shed any light on the argument last evening
###1599 between Mlle. Courtney and the Lord Cronshaw.
###1602 Not really.
###1603 There was a bad atmosphere all evening.
###1605 It was as if something was brewing.
###1608 We all noticed it.
###1609 But they conversed normally at supper?
###1612 Hardly a word.
###1613 No one had much of a chance to say anything
###1616 with Beltaine going on about some china
###1618 he wanted to add to his collection.
###1620 Of course, it all flared up
###1621 after the meal,
###1623 and then I ended up taking her home.
###1625 And when you were alone together
###1629 in the taxi?
###1633 Just a lot of nonsense about how she'd make Cronshaw pay.
###1637 The usual hysterics.
###1640 And then I dropped her off at her flat.
###1644 At what time was this?
###1646 Nearly midnight.
###1647 There was no time to go back to the ball,
###1649 so I just headed home.
###1650 Ah.
###1658 MAN: All right, lower away.
###1662 Okay, okay.
###1666 [ Glass shatters ]
###1671 Sir.
###1682 COURTNEY: He made me feel young again,
###1685 like a newborn calf.
###1688 When I saw him,
###1689 it was as if the whole world was fresh.
###1691 We'll come down right away.
###1693 Even the sky seemed bluer.
###1700 Get up there. Come on.
###1710 MAN: Let's see her face.
###1712 OFFICER: All right, stop that, you lot.
###1714 -- MAN: Courtney! -- OFFICER: Come on.
###1715 MAN: Try and get another picture.
###1717 OFFICER: Come on, move out of the way.
###1720 REPORTER: Could you stop for a minute?
###1723 Still looking, Poirot?
###1726 Poirot, can you make a statement?
###1727 No photographs. No, no, no.
###1736 Chief Inspector.
###1738 JAPP: We found her in the bedroom.
###1740 Overdose of cocaine.
###1741 Presumably supplied by her boyfriend, Lord Cronshaw.
###1745 How many more must die
###1746 before this folly is seen for what it is?
###1749 Toxicity finally got too much for her.
###1751 Cronshaw must have been
###1752 supplying it to her for some time.
###1754 Do you not understand, Chief Inspector?
###1756 Lord Cronshaw was determined to stop
###1759 Mlle. Courtney from taking cocaine.
###1761 The initial, "C," on the silver case —
###1764 it stood for her name, Coco.
###1766 HASTINGS: Of course.
###1768 The quarrel after supper was when Cronshaw discovered
###1770 what he'd suspected all evening --
###1772 that she had a supply with her.
###1773 He took it from her, and that's when she went home.
###1776 JAPP: So, to spite him,
###1777 she took another dose as soon as she got back.
###1780 Messy.
###1782 What I don't see is where
###1784 Cronshaw's murder fits in with all this.
###1786 Because the devil himself dances among us,
###1790 but we do not see him.
###1791 Eh?
###1794 I wonder...
###1797 Chief Inspector,
###1799 will you permit me a further examination of the body?
###1802 Well, I don't know what you expect to find.
###1803 The facts on Miss Courtney are indisputable.
###1805 I am not talking about the body of Mlle. Courtney.
###1809 I am talking about the body of Lord Cronshaw.
###1815 That newspaper headline sent him dippy, if you ask me.
###1819 What's he going to find that we didn't spot last night?
###1822 You checked all his pockets?
###1823 Pockets, clothing, the lot.
###1825 I don't see --
###1826 Indeed you do not see, Chief Inspector.
###1832 JAPP: All right, Poirot, what's the trick?
###1838 Look at his hand.
###1840 What do you observe?
###1841 Clenched fist.
###1843 POIROT: Hastings.
###1844 I agree.
###1845 But the fist -- why is it clenched?
###1854 [ Crunching ]
###1860 Could it be that it hides a secret?
###1872 Voici.
###1873 Swat me, he was holding something.
###1876 POIROT: The pompom.
###1909 [ Doorbell rings ]
###1915 Mr. Poirot!
###1916 Ah, Mme. Mallaby.
###1919 Captain Hastings.
###1920 We meet again. I wonder, could you --
###1922 -- Of course. -- Oh!
###1924 I couldn't decide on my autumn look.
###1926 Anyway, Eustace can afford it.
###1929 He's Viscount Cronshaw now.
###1934 26 pence.
###1935 Oh.
###1937 To what do we owe this delegation?
###1942 Well, M. Poirot has taken it into his head
###1944 to see these famous figurines.
###1946 -- Oh. -- A foolish whim.
###1948 Is His Highness at home, Summers?
###1950 His...Lordship is in the morning room, madam.
###1954 Thank you.
###1955 This way, gang.
###1966 Summers, be a dear
###1967 and take the boxes, will you?
###1970 Hi, Eustace.
###1972 Ooh, I see you're already enjoying your inheritance.
###1976 It's beautiful.
###1977 May as well salvage some consolation
###1980 out of this awful business.
###1982 -- Hmm. -- Ah.
###1983 Poirot, Hastings.
###1985 Welcome.
###1986 Good afternoon, Viscount.
###1988 I say, what a quaint little tea set.
###1991 Hastings, this tea set is not only "quaint,"
###1994 as you call it, but priceless
###1996 and very rare, n'est-ce pas?
###1998 Had no idea you were interested in china, Poirot.
###2001 Mr. Poirot wants to see the figurines.
###2004 The Meissens?
###2005 Mais oui.
###2006 We have all heard so much about them
###2008 and of your success in bringing them to this country.
###2011 I wonder if I could please make an examination.
###2013 Feel free.
###2014 Thank you.
###2020 Ah.
###2022 May I?
###2028 I can't imagine what he's looking for.
###2032 Tricks of the trade, you know.
###2034 POIROT: The costumes last night
###2036 at the ball -- they were exact replicas of these?
###2040 To the last detail.
###2042 Oh.
###2044 And this was your apparel, was it not?
###2047 Punchinello,
###2049 with the elaborate ruff and the hump.
###2052 Yes.
###2055 I imagine it took some time to change
###2058 in and out of this costume.
###2060 I had to hold him up while he unfastened it.
###2065 As I thought.
###2072 Viscount, where were you
###2074 after supper last night during the ball?
###2077 Trying to beat down the dealer chap over this lot.
###2080 Finally managed to corner him.
###2082 In the supper room?
###2084 That's right.
###2085 Again, I thank you.
###2092 Well, cheerio.
###2108 Ah, there you are, Poirot.
###2110 I've been looking for you.
###2112 Chief Inspector Japp.
###2114 I've been doing some thinking,
###2115 and to my mind, that missing pompom
###2117 could only have come from one person.
###2119 I concur absolutely, Chief Inspector.
###2122 Excuse me.
###2131 Mrs. Davidson?
###2132 Yes.
###2134 JAPP: May we come in?
###2137 Oh, thank you.
###2140 I'm sorry my husband isn't here.
###2144 He went out for a drink.
###2145 A bit early for that sort of thing, isn't it?
###2148 He's the sociable type, is he?
###2150 Yes.
###2151 Unlike me.
###2155 Acting isn't exactly a good, steady job, you know.
###2159 You're not in the profession yourself?
###2162 No.
###2163 I thought I might like to once, but I just couldn't,
###2166 not in front of everyone like that.
###2168 Why, indeed there are many types of people in this world, madame.
###2172 We must each be true to ourselves.
###2175 Perhaps.
###2181 What exactly did you want?
###2183 M. Poirot here has some notion
###2185 of staging a reconstruction of the evening.
###2186 POIROT: Oui, that is so.
###2189 Oh?
###2190 Oh, it is just merely a question of detail to be checked.
###2193 The precise nature of the costumes
###2195 that were made for you for last night's ball.
###2198 You understand?
###2199 I think so.
###2200 JAPP: We'd like to have a look at them
###2202 for a moment, if we may. Do you still have them?
###2204 I'm afraid not.
###2207 My husband sent them to be cleaned.
###2212 POIROT: Yes, of course.
###2213 Quel dommage.
###2216 Well, I'm very sorry to have disturbed you, Mme. Davidson.
###2219 We will just finish our tea.
###2226 [ Coughs ]
###2237 POIROT: Thank you, Hastings.
###2242 You were right, Mme. Davidson,
###2243 not to consider a career in acting.
###2245 Your eyes betrayed what your tongue denied.
###2249 Chief Inspector?
###2250 There's a pompom missing from the Pierrette costume.
###2252 Is there?
###2254 JAPP: Perhaps you'd like to tell us
###2256 how it came to turn up in the hand of the murdered man.
###2259 Oh, yes, I forgot.
###2260 It got pulled off after supper,
###2262 and I didn't know what to do with it.
###2265 I looked for Mr. Beltaine, but he was in the supper room
###2268 having some kind of argument,
###2271 so I gave it to Lord Cronshaw to look after.
###2273 Sorry, I didn't think it was important.
###2276 Does that answer your question?
###2279 You must understand, Mme. Davidson,
###2280 that to conceal information may not only protect the guilty,
###2283 but also punish the innocent.
###2286 You do understand, do you not?
###2289 I understand.
###2292 I'm sorry.
###2297 BOY: Sunday Standard!
###2298 Her story seemed completely plausible.
###2300 Except in one respect.
###2302 -- What's that? -- It is a foolish lie.
###2305 The threads of the pompom that we discovered
###2307 in the hand of Lord Cronshaw —
###2308 they were torn, whereas those
###2310 on the costume of Mme. Davidson were cut.
###2312 You mean she cut it off herself?
###2314 No, no, Hastings.
###2315 She did not even notice that the pompom was missing
###2317 until we pointed it out.
###2318 That is why she made up that story that was ridiculous.
###2320 Hers was cut by the murderer.
###2322 Why?
###2323 To replace the one that Lord Cronshaw
###2325 had torn from the costume of his killer.
###2327 Well, if it wasn't her, and her husband
###2329 wasn't even there when Cronshaw was murdered —
###2331 Have either of you considered the possibility
###2333 of a duplicate costume?
###2334 Another Pierrot?
###2335 Well, what about that note he left -- Lowestoft?
###2339 Ah, yes, the note.
###2342 May I suggest that you inquire
###2344 from the dealer about the dinner service
###2346 that has just been purchased by Lord Beltaine?
###2348 I think you will discover that it is rare Lowestoft china.
###2352 You mean —
###2354 And now it is necessary to restore
###2356 the reputation of Hercule Poirot.
###2385 [ Radio tuning ]
###2387 [ Music plays ]
###2389 MAN: This is the National Programme.
###2392 In a change to our published schedule,
###2395 we now present a special broadcast.
###2403 Good evening, everybody.
###2405 This is Hercule Poirot.
###2408 I have been asked many times to recount my cases for the radio,
###2412 but I have always refused.
###2415 However, tonight, I have decided to present for you
###2419 a reconstruction of the affair at the Victory Ball,
###2424 and that is why I have with me tonight in the studio
###2427 the principal members of the party
###2430 whose lives were altered by that most tragic event.
###2433 I thank you all very, very much, indeed,
###2436 for accepting my invitation.
###2439 And now, I take you back to the Colossus Ballroom
###2444 on the night of the Victory Ball.
###2447 The lights, they dim.
###2449 The music, it plays.
###2454 And the shadows of the principal characters
###2458 return to gather before us.
###2465 Listen.
###2468 You can almost hear them.
###2471 MAN: Harlequin am I,
###2472 in diamond panes of colored hue.
###2475 WOMAN: And I his Columbine.
###2477 Together, we have
###2479 special care for lovers true.
###2482 MAN: Punchinello also here appears.
###2485 Bombast and buffoon to no avail.
###2489 WOMAN: Seeking heart
###2490 of Pulcinella, ever shall he fail.
###2494 MAN: Heroes' tragic fate is saddest.
###2497 See his painted tear.
###2500 WOMAN: Sighing for his own Pierrette,
###2503 star-crossed lovers.
###2505 So completes
###2507 our masqueraders gathered once more here.
###2513 And so our little evocation is complete.
###2518 Our ensemble is before us.
###2521 And this, ladies and gentlemen,
###2524 I have been told is the wonder of radio,
###2527 because what we see is in the eye of our mind.
###2531 What is in the eye of your mind,
###2534 Mme. Mallaby?
###2536 Why, the six characters we heard,
###2539 of course.
###2540 Viscount?
###2542 Oh, just the same.
###2543 The six characters as portrayed
###2546 by my figurines, but —
###2549 You agree, Mme. Davidson?
###2554 Of course we agree, Mr. Poirot.
###2556 POIROT: Bon.
###2557 But now let us see the reality before us.
###2562 Messieurs, mesdames,
###2564 the players.
###2567 Oh.
###2570 I present to you Pierrette, Pierrot,
###2572 Pulcinella, Punchinello, and Columbine.
###2576 There's one missing.
###2578 That's right.
###2579 Where's Harlequin?
###2581 Have you forgotten, Viscount,
###2585 that Harlequin can become invisible?
###2593 Let us now reveal the truth.
###2599 Are you ready to tell us the truth,
###2602 Mme. Davidson,
###2604 or shall I?
###2609 Very well.
###2611 It was all very simple.
###2615 The motive behind the murders
###2617 of both Lord Cronshaw and Coco Courtney
###2621 was the evil drug cocaine.
###2626 You're staying right here!
###2628 I'm not prepared to have an argument about it.
###2631 POIROT: During the Victory Ball,
###2632 I witnessed an argument between
###2634 Lord Cronshaw and Mlle. Coco.
###2635 They were known to be lovers,
###2637 but Cronshaw had discovered Coco's secret addiction.
###2639 What the hell do you think you're laughing at?
###2641 POIROT: The young Lord Cronshaw was a man of high principle.
###2645 He seized his lover's cocaine and threatened to
###2648 expose the supplier who was destroying her life
###2652 along with many others.
###2654 But Coco was now hopelessly addicted.
###2661 By the time she reached home,
###2664 she had obtained a new, fatally strong dose of cocaine
###2667 from her supplier, who now knew
###2669 the one chance to avoid prison
###2671 was murder.
###2675 But what of our Harlequin?
###2678 When I examined the body of Lord Cronshaw,
###2680 I failed to discover the pompom.
###2683 Why?
###2684 Because the fist was clenched tight with the rigor mortis.
###2687 Lord Cronshaw was not killed at 12:00.
###2690 He was killed earlier in the evening
###2692 and the body hidden in the recess until later.
###2694 Voilà.
###2695 But that can't be.
###2697 I saw him myself a few moments before midnight.
###2700 No, no, no, Mme. Mallaby.
###2703 The Harlequin that you saw, that very same Harlequin,
###2706 is here with us in this room.
###2713 The killer had a duplicate costume,
###2716 and after the murder, assumed the role of Harlequin,
###2720 even scribbling a false clue pointing to M. Beltaine
###2724 and his obsession with the Lowestoft china.
###2727 Ridiculous, huh?
###2728 Since the elaborate costume of M. Beltaine
###2731 cannot be changed without assistance.
###2735 No.
###2737 The murder took place soon after supper,
###2739 when the killer contrived
###2741 a moment alone with Lord Cronshaw.
###2743 It is Cronshaw who knows the truth
###2745 about the dealing in cocaine.
###2748 To avoid being exposed and to preserve
###2751 the evil trade in drugs,
###2752 the murderer stabs Lord Cronshaw to death.
###2755 At the time,
###2757 the killer is unaware that the last act of Lord Cronshaw
###2761 is to pull the pompom from the costume.
###2764 Then the body is hidden in the alcove
###2766 and the plan, it can be completed.
###2769 -- MALLABY: Yoo-hoo! -- POIROT: At last,
###2771 having alerted Mme. Mallaby just before midnight,
###2774 the final task was to drag the body
###2777 from its hiding place
###2778 so it would appear
###2779 that the murder had only just been committed.
###2781 MAN: Twelve seconds to midnight!
###2785 Ten, nine,
###2786 eight, seven, six,
###2790 five, four,
###2792 three, two, one!
###2796 [ Cheers and applause ]
###2800 [ Balloons popping ]
###2805 POIROT: The murderer then slips quietly away.
###2809 [ Screams ]
###2811 POIROT: Knowing that when the discovery
###2814 of the body occurs, it is believed
###2818 that he is safely at home.
###2822 No, it couldn't have been Chris.
###2825 POIROT: But it was, Mme. Davidson.
###2828 It was your husband who had
###2829 a moment alone with Lord Cronshaw!
###2830 It was your husband who gave to Coco
###2832 when they were alone together in the taxi more cocaine!
###2834 And, in spite of what he told us,
###2837 it was your husband
###2838 who had ample time to return to the ball
###2841 to complete his masquerade as Harlequin.
###2857 And still you protect him,
###2860 even though you later discovered
###2864 that he was implicating you, his own wife, in the crime
###2868 by replacing the pompom that was torn from his costume
###2872 with the one he cut from your own.
###2875 CHRIS: Don't listen to him, darling.
###2877 Congratulations, Mr. Poirot,
###2880 on a most entertaining piece of detective fiction.
###2884 POIROT: Mais oui.
###2885 I'm afraid that is so.
###2888 Half a mo. What do you mean?
###2891 Well, because unless Mme. Davidson
###2892 is willing to testify that her husband deals in drugs,
###2895 I'm afraid that everything that I have told you so far
###2898 remains only theory.
###2899 Then I take it that the show is over.
###2901 POIROT: Oui.
###2902 Unless...
###2908 Harlequin has one last trick.
###2919 Mme. Mallaby.
###2922 With which hand did you see Harlequin writing?
###2929 Oh, my God.
###2931 Cronshaw was right-handed.
###2933 JAPP: Christopher Ian Davidson,
###2937 I arrest you for the murders of Viscount Cronshaw
###2940 and Miss Coco Courtney.
###2950 If he had not gone too far and tried to confuse
###2953 by writing a clue that pointed to Beltaine,
###2955 he would be walking away with us now,
###2958 but as you say, M. Ackerley, actors —
###2960 they never know when to stop.
###2962 However, I thank you very much indeed
###2964 for your cooperation.
###2965 I'm honored that you took up my invitation.
###2967 I'm sure it was a most enlightening experience
###2969 for our listeners.
###2970 -- Thank you. -- RECEPTIONIST: Mr. Ackerley?
###2972 They've been trying to find you.
###2974 The switchboard's been flooded with callers
###2977 complaining about the dreadful accent,
###2979 lowering the standard of spoken English,
###2982 all that sort of thing.
###2983 Oh.
###2984 Sir John Reith is waiting to see you in his office.
###2988 So sorry.
###2993 Don't take it too hard, Poirot.
###2995 Indeed not.
###2997 I am not at all surprised.
###2999 -- HASTINGS: You're not? -- No.
###3000 Chief Inspector, you really ought to look to your elocution.
###3003 Swat me, there's nothing wrong with my lingo.
###3005 You see, that is exactly the kind of expression,
###3008 like "half a mo,"
###3009 that brings the language into disrepute.
###3010 Come, Hastings.
###3012 I shall lend to the Chief Inspector
###3016 my personal copy
###3018 of "The English As She Should Be Spoken."
###3027 Taxi!
