this morning.

0:0:13,48 --> 0:0:15,466
The sun has come up again.


4
0:0:15,466 --> 0:0:17,265
It's another beautiful
day in China.

0:0:17,265 --> 0:0:20,18

0:0:20,18 --> 0:0:23,74
I guess for cheating last night,
I got what I deserved.

0:0:23,74 --> 0:0:27,64
In this whole time on Thumbs
Up, the rooftops, the


8
0:0:27,64 --> 0:0:32,83

9
0:0:32,83 --> 0:0:34,12
while we were sleeping.


10
0:0:34,12 --> 0:0:37,54
First night in a hotel, I get
a spider bite on my fucking


11
0:0:37,54 --> 0:0:40,97
cheek, on my neck,
and on my ass.


12
0:0:40,97 --> 0:0:44,13
I woke up this morning; I can't
fucking move my leg, or


13
0:0:44,13 --> 0:0:45,86
this side of my face hurts.


14
0:0:45,86 --> 0:0:47,28
It's like I have TMJ.


15
0:0:47,28 --> 0:0:51,56

that feels like, but.

0:0:54,78 --> 0:0:57,93
The guy's like a
mythical hero.


18
0:0:57,93 --> 0:0:59,51
He comes to a town.


19
0:0:59,51 --> 0:1:1,185
He entertains the locals.


20
0:1:1,185 --> 0:1:2,755
He beats up the bad guy.


21
0:1:2,755 --> 0:1:4,629
He gets the girl at the
end of the show.


22
0:1:4,629 --> 0:1:6,68
I mean, it's like
who does that?


23
0:1:6,68 --> 0:1:8,27
Do they even make people
like that anymore?


24
0:1:8,27 --> 0:1:10,87
Did they ever make
people like that?


25
0:1:10,87 --> 0:1:13,39
We're still trying
to head south.


26
0:1:13,39 --> 0:1:15,48
Try to get a ride
into Changsha.


27
0:1:15,48 --> 0:1:17,81
I woke up this morning, and I
took this painting off the


28
0:1:17,81 --> 0:1:19,4
wall of this hotel.


29
0:1:19,4 --> 0:1:23,72
And I just drew this.


30
0:1:23,72 --> 0:1:29,146
So without further ado, let's
continue this ride.

0:2:18,31 --> 0:2:23,6
we just got a ride in Wuhan,
and we're heading south.


36
0:2:23,6 --> 0:2:25,5
The team is broken up again.


37
0:2:25,5 --> 0:2:26,966

38
0:2:26,966 --> 0:2:31,26
We'll find out if three's
company or not.


39
0:2:31,26 --> 0:2:32,51
It's a weird one, this one.

Wait, wait, wait.


44
0:2:57,89 --> 0:3:2,1

0:3:2,1 --> 0:3:5,52
Once again, the entire country's
under construction.


46
0:3:5,52 --> 0:3:7,67
There's these trucks everywhere,
and they're all


47
0:3:7,67 --> 0:3:10,48
driving to one city to the next,
and they don't really


48

jump in or not.

They're still trains, but
the people on the


68
0:4:10,5 --> 0:4:12,23
lines aren't as nice.


69
0:4:12,23 --> 0:4:15,79
And we havw to do a lot more
speaking, and there's a lot


70
0:4:15,79 --> 0:4:18,98
more transition, and there's
a lot more barbed wire.

Then, she doesn't know what
she's getting into.

She pops rides with us in a
construction truck today.

We get off somewhere between
Wuhan and Changsha.


100
0:5:32,93 --> 0:5:37,28
Then we try to hop on a train,
and I turn around, and I see

jumped off the train.

And then, our luck, we found
a passenger train.

refuse to get out.

stop we got to, she

went through--

We're like on the nasty, nasty
disgusting shores of Shenzhen.


418
0:21:51,12 --> 0:21:55,15
Just over that mountain right
there is Hong Kong.

0:21:55,15 --> 0:21:58,75
That's where Hong
Kong, Macau--

still technically China,
but once we leave, we

0:22:2,67 --> 0:22:3,45
can't come back in.


422
0:22:3,45 --> 0:22:5,82

So we're just wandering.

This dude just was like
yo, what's up?


425
0:22:10,44 --> 0:22:13,94
We got our feet completely
covered in mud.


426
0:22:13,94 --> 0:22:18,24
And he just picked us up,
and he won't talk to us.


427
0:22:18,24 --> 0:22:21,1
But he'll give us a
ride in his jeep.

We take all rides,
so here we go.

Hey, Chong.


434
0:22:41,47 --> 0:22:43,71
I'm going to the Venetian
in Macau.


435
0:22:43,71 --> 0:22:45,902
Can you call someone and
hook me up there?


436
0:22:45,902 --> 0:22:46,85
I'm with Harry.

0:22:46,85 --> 0:22:49,87
We'll be there in a few hours.

With one phone call to my host
in Las Vegas, the Venetian he

called his friend, the guy that
hired his ass, in the

448
0:23:20,24 --> 0:23:23,19
He sent a hydrofoil to Shenzhen,
picked us up.


449
0:23:23,19 --> 0:23:27,29
And then dude waiting for us
right here in Macau gave us


450
0:23:27,29 --> 0:23:29,29
one of the dopest, sweetest
rides we've ever got in our

0:23:29,29 --> 0:23:32,0
life from our driver Ken Kong.


452
0:23:32,0 --> 0:23:35,406

Kong dollar car, right Ken?

0:23:35,406 --> 0:23:36,36
-Yes.

0:23:36,36 --> 0:23:39,49

0:23:43,3 --> 0:23:44,92
a car this expensive.


458
0:23:44,92 --> 0:23:46,73
I can't believe they even
let us in here.

looks down upon you when

you're degenerate.

China was long and hard.

0:24:40,1 --> 0:24:40,66
It was dirty.

0:24:40,66 --> 0:24:42,2
It was grimy.
