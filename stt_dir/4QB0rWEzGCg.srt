CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: As we begin this March
5th edition of CNN`s STUDENT NEWS, we`re heading


2
0:0:15,21 --> 0:0:19,58
to the African nation of Kenya. It`s home
to a population of 43 million people. Kenya`s


3
0:0:19,58 --> 0:0:23,36
government is a republic where its citizens
elect their leaders and that`s what they did


4
0:0:23,36 --> 0:0:23,63
yesterday.


5
0:0:23,63 --> 0:0:27,9
NIC ROBERTSON, CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT:
This comes after a new constitution was passed


6
0:0:27,9 --> 0:0:33,0
on 2010 and is the most complex election in
Kenya`s history. People will be voting for


7
0:0:33,0 --> 0:0:38,48
member of county assembly, governor, senator,
women`s member of national assembly, member


8
0:0:38,48 --> 0:0:41,22
of national assembly, and finally president.


9
0:0:41,22 --> 0:0:45,78
AZUZ: Part of the reason why Kenya`s constitution
changed was the violence that followed the


10
0:0:45,78 --> 0:0:50,21
country`s last presidential election. The
results were challenged. Supporters of different


11
0:0:50,21 --> 0:0:55,1
candidates fought each other. More than 1,200
people were killed. The changes to the country`s


12
0:0:55,1 --> 0:0:58,42
government were designed to make future elections
more peaceful.


13
0:0:58,42 --> 0:1:1,989
ROBERTSON: People have been turning out to
vote in the polling stations like this one


14
0:1:1,989 --> 0:1:6,93
in the poor city of Mombassa since before
6 in the morning when the polling stations


15
0:1:6,93 --> 0:1:12,75
opened. Some places we visited had lines half
a mile long. And that`s despite fears of the


16
0:1:12,75 --> 0:1:15,54
possibility of tribal violence.


17
0:1:15,54 --> 0:1:23,43
AZUZ stations. There was a stampede at another
voting site. And some police officers were


18
0:1:23,43 --> 0:1:27,42
attacked. Some Kenyans were preparing for
this kind of thing before the election and


19
0:1:27,42 --> 0:1:32,9
they were planning to use social media to
help reduce violence on election day. Nima


20
0:1:32,9 --> 0:1:33,619
Elbagir explains how.


21
0:1:33,619 --> 0:1:39,46
NIMA ELBAGIR, NAIROBI, KENYA: During the violence
that marred the 2007 elections here, citizen


22
0:1:39,46 --> 0:1:44,579
journalists were crucial in helping to pinpoint
the worst effected areas, and none more than


23
0:1:44,579 --> 0:1:47,21
Ushahidi which means witness in Swahili.


24
0:1:47,21 --> 0:1:52,729
You have been working on different ways to
ensure that this election is transparent.


25
0:1:52,729 --> 0:1:56,869
DAUDI WERE, USHAHIDI: What you see here is
a team of digital humanitarians. The people


26
0:1:56,869 --> 0:2:1,67
who deal with the data that we get into the
system. Uchaguzi (ph) the Swahili name for


27
0:2:1,67 --> 0:2:7,68
"election" is the name of the platform we
are deploying for this election. We have partners


28
0:2:7,68 --> 0:2:12,21
across the country sending us information,
but also verifying the information that we


29
0:2:12,21 --> 0:2:18,3
get. And the second tool that we use is a
technology platform (INAUDIBLE) and the various


30
0:2:18,3 --> 0:2:18,35
apps that go along with it.


31
0:2:18,35 --> 0:2:23,2
ELBAGIR: Because the apps are really cool.
You`ve got one on your phone right here. So


32
0:2:23,2 --> 0:2:28,29
people go online, they download this app,
and then anywhere in the country if they see


33
0:2:28,29 --> 0:2:32,55
something they have concern about they go
onto the app and they report it, or they tweet


34
0:2:32,55 --> 0:2:34,96
it, or they take a picture and it reaches
you immediately.


35
0:2:34,96 --> 0:2:38,2
WERE: You have the power in your hands (ph)
to protect your vote and that`s what we`re


36
0:2:38,2 --> 0:2:41,95
doing at Ordinary Citizens - working together
to protect our vote and our electoral process.


37
0:2:41,95 --> 0:2:48,17
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Is this legit? Women
with HIV can pass the virus to their children


38
0:2:48,17 --> 0:2:51,94
during pregnancy.


39
0:2:51,94 --> 0:2:59,1
This is true. Infected mothers can infect
their babies during pregnancy, delivery, or


40
0:2:59,1 --> 0:3:0,25
nursing.


41
0:3:0,25 --> 0:3:6,45
AZUZ: HIV stands for Human Immunodeficiency
Virus. It affects the body`s immune system,


42
0:3:6,45 --> 0:3:11,26
and it can lead to AIDS. There`s not an official
cure, but researchers say a 2-year-old girl


43
0:3:11,26 --> 0:3:16,27
from this Mississippi hospital was the first
child to be functionally cured of HIV.


44
0:3:16,27 --> 0:3:21,35
That`s an important difference. Functionally
cured doesn`t mean the virus is gone completely.


45
0:3:21,35 --> 0:3:26,26
It means that the virus` presence is so small
that standard tests can`t find it, and the


46
0:3:26,26 --> 0:3:28,35
patient doesn`t need lifelong treatment.


47
0:3:28,35 --> 0:3:33,23
Here`s how it happened. The baby`s mother
has HIV. Within 30 hours of the birth, doctors


48
0:3:33,23 --> 0:3:38,98
started treating the baby for HIV. The baby
was on HIV drugs for about 15 months, then


49
0:3:38,98 --> 0:3:44,14
for whatever reason the mother stopped giving
the baby the drugs. She was off them from


50
0:3:44,14 --> 0:3:49,45
8-10 months. When doctors saw her next, no
signs of HIV. She was functionally cured.


51
0:3:49,45 --> 0:3:52,7
DR. HANNAH GAY, UNIV. OF MISSISSIPPI MEDICAL
CENTER: That`s still a possibility and we`re


52
0:3:52,7 --> 0:3:58,57
going to be following the baby for a while
to make sure that the virus does not come


53
0:3:58,57 --> 0:4:6,95
back. However, at this point, she`s been off
medicines for quite some time and there has


54
0:4:6,95 --> 0:4:11,9
been no return of the virus. This is quite
unique. We`ve not seen this in other cases


55
0:4:11,9 --> 0:4:12,47
before.


56
0:4:12,47 --> 0:4:19,22
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Today`s shoutout goes
to Ms. Jaeger`s U.S. government class at Spring


57
0:4:19,22 --> 0:4:22,69
Valley High School in Las Vegas, Nevada.


58
0:4:22,69 --> 0:4:29,419
Which prefix is the Latin word that means
"field?" Here we go. Is it tapo, agri, pharma,


59
0:4:29,419 --> 0:4:30,4
or tera?


60
0:4:30,4 --> 0:4:37,3
You`ve got three seconds, go.


61
0:4:37,3 --> 0:4:44,729
Agri is Latin for "field" and agriculture
is the culture of the field, like raising


62
0:4:44,729 --> 0:4:50,389
crops and livestock. That`s your answer, and
that`s your shoutout.


63
0:4:50,389 --> 0:4:55,93
AZUZ: A huge amount of the food the world
produces, up to half of it in some places,


64
0:4:55,93 --> 0:4:59,9
is wasted. And this is what we mean by that.
What you didn`t finish from your meal at a


65
0:4:59,9 --> 0:5:4,139
restaurant and what you don`t take home to
eat is thrown out - it`s wasted. When you


66
0:5:4,139 --> 0:5:9,36
buy food at the store but wind up trashing
it later, wasted. When grocery stores don`t


67
0:5:9,36 --> 0:5:13,669
sell all the fruits and vegetables they have
in time or when they won`t accept farm produce


68
0:5:13,669 --> 0:5:18,2
that doesn`t look fresh but actually might
be, that can go to waste.


69
0:5:18,2 --> 0:5:23,9
It`s a problem worldwide, but there are some
solutions to it. One is not buying more food


70
0:5:23,9 --> 0:5:28,8
than you can eat or share. CNN`s Erin McLaughlin
found another at a store in England.


71
0:5:28,8 --> 0:5:34,169
ERIN MCLAUGHLIN, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Vegetables
lie rotting in an English field. It`s not


72
0:5:34,169 --> 0:5:40,689
bad weather that`s done it. It`s not insects
or pests that have made it inedible. The farmers


73
0:5:40,689 --> 0:5:47,12
in charge of this field say they had to reject
all of this cabbage because it didn`t look


74
0:5:47,12 --> 0:5:47,3
right.


75
0:5:47,3 --> 0:5:51,819
TRISTRAM STUART, FEEDING SK: Here we have,
look at that. A couple of weeks ago, this


76
0:5:51,819 --> 0:5:56,389
was a beautiful head of broccoli. Lovely sprouting
broccoli. It`s one of my favorite vegetables.


77
0:5:56,389 --> 0:6:1,62
And as you can see, we have half an acre of
rotten broccoli here. It breaks my heart.


78
0:6:1,62 --> 0:6:7,259
MCLAUGHLIN: Tristram Stuart and his team collect
food that would otherwise go to waste. They`re


79
0:6:7,259 --> 0:6:9,409
here to salvage what`s left of the cabbages.


80
0:6:9,409 --> 0:6:13,71
STUART: You can see the outer leaves have
been pecked by pigeons. That means that the


81
0:6:13,71 --> 0:6:17,52
supermarkets don`t want them, even though
no one eats these outer leaves and the heart


82
0:6:17,52 --> 0:6:21,219
of this cabbage is perfectly good, fresh,
delicious, nutritious food.


83
0:6:21,219 --> 0:6:26,569
MCLAUGHLIN: According to a study, up to 30
percent of the UK`s vegetable crop never leaves


84
0:6:26,569 --> 0:6:35,99
the field as a result of such practices. But
it doesn`t have to be this way. Here at The


85
0:6:35,99 --> 0:6:41,219
People`s Supermarket in central London, chef
Arthur Potts Dawson sees beyond imperfection.


86
0:6:41,219 --> 0:6:45,319
The People`s Supermarket accepts produce from
the field that would have otherwise gone to


87
0:6:45,319 --> 0:6:45,4
waste.


88
0:6:45,4 --> 0:6:48,569
ARTHUR POTTS DAWSON, THE PEOPLE`S SUPERMARKET:
Well, we actively went out and sought it.


89
0:6:48,569 --> 0:6:53,129
You know? We really, really looked for it.
I would go into the field and there would


90
0:6:53,129 --> 0:6:57,779
be pulling out tons and tons and tons of potatoes
every hour, but there was a byproduct. About


91
0:6:57,779 --> 0:7:2,169
30 percent of it, misshapen, a little bit
crushed, was just discarded. I said, well


92
0:7:2,169 --> 0:7:7,759
what are you doing with those? And they said,
you want them? And I said, I don`t just want


93
0:7:7,759 --> 0:7:9,849
them, I will pay you for them.


94
0:7:9,849 --> 0:7:18,819
MCLAUGHLIN: The result, a colorful array of
vegetables. Imperfect avocado, kale, and artichoke.


95
0:7:18,819 --> 0:7:24,719
How has the consumer responded? Do people
come in here? Do they notice some of the imperfections?


96
0:7:24,719 --> 0:7:25,439
And do they buy?


97
0:7:25,439 --> 0:7:30,789
POTTS DAWSON: People have already been trained
by decades of supermarkets now to only buy


98
0:7:30,789 --> 0:7:37,8
the perfect, you know, the perfect leek. But
the imperfect leek, if they don`t buy it,


99
0:7:37,8 --> 0:7:38,809
I`ll take it.


100
0:7:38,809 --> 0:7:42,559
MCLAUGHLIN: And they practice what they preach
here. There`s a full kitchen at the back of


101
0:7:42,559 --> 0:7:47,389
the supermarket, complete with a chef who
uses the produce customers don`t buy to make


102
0:7:47,389 --> 0:7:53,5
ready-made meals to be sold in the store.
Proof that looks don`t necessarily matter


103
0:7:53,5 --> 0:7:58,8
when it comes to making delicious food. Erin
McLaughlin, CNN, London.


104
0:7:58,8 --> 0:8:3,599
AZUZ: A new report from Facebook says that
teenagers may be getting sick of Facebook,


105
0:8:3,599 --> 0:8:7,509
and heading to other social media apps and
sites. What do you think about this idea of


106
0:8:7,509 --> 0:8:14,61
Facebook fatigue? If you`re still on Facebook,
talk to us about it on Facebook.com/cnnstudentnews.


107
0:8:14,61 --> 0:8:18,289
Joseph Brunell (ph) is an eighth grader at
Vickery Creek Middle School in Forsyth County,


108
0:8:18,289 --> 0:8:22,729
Georgia. He loves basket ball, but Joseph
has a medical condition called Spina Bifida.


109
0:8:22,729 --> 0:8:27,689
It restricts him to a wheelchair, so he can`t
play on the Vickery Creek team. At least,


110
0:8:27,689 --> 0:8:29,86
that was true until one recent game.


111
0:8:29,86 --> 0:8:33,7
MICHAEL CHEEK, HEAD COACH, VICKERY CREEK BASKETBALL
TEAM: It`s going to be a surprise. It`s going


112
0:8:33,7 --> 0:8:36,1
to all about Joseph Brunell (ph).


113
0:8:36,1 --> 0:8:41,12
AZUZ: For the fourth quarter, they gave Joseph
a jersey and brought the game to him. Players


114
0:8:41,12 --> 0:8:46,78
on both teams have been secretly practicing
in wheelchairs so that they could make Joseph


115
0:8:46,78 --> 0:8:51,3
part of this game. One of his teammates said
they did this for Joseph because of what he


116
0:8:51,3 --> 0:8:52,14
taught them.


117
0:8:52,14 --> 0:8:58,4
UNIDENTIFIED STUDENT: We learned to never
give up, and always try our best in every


118
0:8:58,4 --> 0:8:59,65
thing we do.


119
0:8:59,65 --> 0:9:4,91
AZUZ: Fantastic story. It`s March, we may
be a little early for the madness, but this


120
0:9:4,91 --> 0:9:10,12
video makes a great warm up. High school section
championship. Team in-bounding the ball is


121
0:9:10,12 --> 0:9:16,14
down two with three seconds to go. Crosscourt
pass, stolen, Ball thrown in the air to run


122
0:9:16,14 --> 0:9:21,29
out the clock, but the guy who threw the in-bound
pass gets his hands on it, and heaves up a


123
0:9:21,29 --> 0:9:28,77
desperation shot. Makes it. 55-foot shot at
the buzzer. Watch it play out in real time.


124
0:9:28,77 --> 0:9:32,42
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


125
0:9:32,42 --> 0:9:36,7
(END VIDEO CLIP)


126
0:9:36,7 --> 0:9:44,35
AZUZ: A last second shot that nets a ton of
attention. That was definitely a buzzer-beater.


127
0:9:44,35 --> 0:9:49,47
Teachers, your feedback, our homepage, perfect
match. Tell us what you thought of today`s


128
0:9:49,47 --> 0:11:49,47
show and we`ll meet you back here tomorrow
for more CNN STUDENT NEWS.
