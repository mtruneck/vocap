1
0:0:7,706 --> 0:0:13,987
ALICE ROBERTS: They say this is where it all began.


2
0:0:13,987 --> 0:0:20,667
That we are all children of Africa.


3
0:0:20,667 --> 0:0:26,266
But if so, why do we look so different?


4
0:0:26,266 --> 0:0:30,106
And how on earth could a handful of African families


5
0:0:30,106 --> 0:0:45,267
become a whole world full of people?


6
0:0:45,267 --> 0:0:50,27
I'm Alice Roberts, medical doctor and anthropologist.


7
0:0:50,27 --> 0:0:55,226
I'm fascinated by what bones, stones,


8
0:0:55,226 --> 0:1:1,67
and even our bodies can reveal about the distant past.


9
0:1:1,67 --> 0:1:5,667
I'm going in search of the traces left by our African ancestors


10
0:1:5,667 --> 0:1:9,427
and their journeys to populate the world.


11
0:1:9,427 --> 0:1:12,787
This time, the most challenging journey yet..


12
0:1:12,787 --> 0:1:15,66
Asia.


13
0:1:15,66 --> 0:1:20,147
Could people out of Africa really have conquered its frozen wastes?


14
0:1:20,147 --> 0:1:22,706
I don't think I've ever been so cold.


15
0:1:22,706 --> 0:1:29,346
And did the journey cause a change in the way people look?


16
0:1:29,346 --> 0:1:32,507
or have I got it completely wrong?


17
0:1:32,507 --> 0:1:35,667
I'm going to investigate an astonishing idea


18
0:1:35,667 --> 0:1:40,27
that the Chinese could be descended from a different branch of the human family


19
0:1:40,27 --> 0:1:45,27
to the rest of us.


20
0:1:45,27 --> 0:1:48,147
Come with me in the footsteps of our ancestors,


21
0:1:48,147 --> 0:2:9,266
on the most epic adventure ever undertaken.


22
0:2:9,266 --> 0:2:12,826
ROBERTS: Siberia, north of the Arctic Circle.


23
0:2:12,826 --> 0:2:16,227
I'm going to meet one of the most remote peoples on Earth


24
0:2:16,227 --> 0:2:18,387
to help solve a mystery.


25
0:2:18,387 --> 0:2:26,347
Why would our ancestors have ever ventured into such a wilderness?


26
0:2:26,347 --> 0:2:30,947
We're flying over vast expanses of ice and snow,


27
0:2:30,947 --> 0:2:36,546
but I'm getting very close to my destination now.


28
0:2:36,546 --> 0:2:38,986
I'm heading deep into Asia,


29
0:2:38,986 --> 0:2:41,586
5,000 kilometres east of Moscow


30
0:2:41,586 --> 0:2:55,26
to the small town of olenek.


31
0:2:55,26 --> 0:3:1,706
I've come to meet the Evenki.


32
0:3:1,706 --> 0:3:3,667
These people are the closest I can get


33
0:3:3,667 --> 0:3:16,306
to the humans I think first conquered these lands.


34
0:3:16,306 --> 0:3:18,507
I've arrived on a special day.


35
0:3:18,507 --> 0:3:21,106
It's the annual reindeer festival.


36
0:3:21,106 --> 0:3:27,747
(PEOPLE CHEERING)


37
0:3:27,747 --> 0:3:31,387
These animals have been vital to the people of Siberia


38
0:3:31,387 --> 0:3:41,26
for as long as anyone can remember.


39
0:3:41,26 --> 0:3:55,667
That's one lost his seat.


40
0:3:55,667 --> 0:3:57,426
People have come to this festival


41
0:3:57,426 --> 0:4:0,347
from an area the size of Britain and France put together,


42
0:4:0,347 --> 0:4:2,747
to race their reindeer on the frozen river.


43
0:4:2,747 --> 0:4:4,387
But it's also an opportunity


44
0:4:4,387 --> 0:4:12,306
for the people that live so scattered across this landscape to come together.


45
0:4:12,306 --> 0:4:16,346
ROBERTS: How our ancestors first came to these cold lands,


46
0:4:16,346 --> 0:4:19,346
and then survived here, is a mystery.


47
0:4:19,346 --> 0:4:27,387
So I hope the Evenki can help.


48
0:4:27,387 --> 0:4:30,387
But to find out more, I must leave the festival


49
0:4:30,387 --> 0:4:35,387
and head for one of their remote camps.


50
0:4:35,387 --> 0:4:37,187
It's going to be tough.


51
0:4:37,187 --> 0:4:40,706
It's already minus 26 degrees Celsius,


52
0:4:40,706 --> 0:4:44,466
and they say it could get a lot colder.


53
0:4:44,466 --> 0:4:46,947
I've got layers and layers on here.


54
0:4:46,947 --> 0:4:50,947
There are two, three, four...


55
0:4:50,947 --> 0:4:52,547
five with the coat.


56
0:4:52,547 --> 0:4:56,507
And it's absolutely essential that every bit of my skin is covered,


57
0:4:56,507 --> 0:4:58,507
including my face.


58
0:4:58,507 --> 0:5:5,947
Because if anything is exposed, it will literally freeze.


59
0:5:5,947 --> 0:5:10,906
But it seems that even my finest 2 1 st-century, hi-tech clothing


60
0:5:10,906 --> 0:5:14,26
is no match for the Siberian winter.


61
0:5:14,26 --> 0:5:18,26
Thank you.


62
0:5:18,26 --> 0:5:22,226
My driver is not convinced that this jacket is adequate,


63
0:5:22,226 --> 0:5:26,67
and he's given me a reindeer-fur jacket instead.


64
0:5:26,67 --> 0:5:29,266
I think he might be right, because reindeer fur is amazing.


65
0:5:29,266 --> 0:5:32,507
Each of these outer hairs is actually hollow


66
0:5:32,507 --> 0:5:34,107
and it's got air inside,


67
0:5:34,107 --> 0:5:37,387
so it's fantastic insulation.


68
0:5:37,387 --> 0:5:46,586
And I'm going to be testing it out.


69
0:5:46,586 --> 0:5:59,947
ROBERTS: Wonderful. Amazing stuff.


70
0:5:59,947 --> 0:6:14,666
To start with, the reindeer fur keeps me really warm.


71
0:6:14,666 --> 0:6:19,666
I even have a go at driving myself.


72
0:6:19,666 --> 0:6:23,187
But as the journey goes on, I begin to feel the cold.


73
0:6:23,187 --> 0:6:35,67
And with the wind chill, the temperature drops well below minus 40.


74
0:6:35,67 --> 0:6:40,867
As the hours go by, it gets colder.


75
0:6:40,867 --> 0:6:48,266
I'm starting to lose feeling in my fingers and toes.


76
0:6:48,266 --> 0:6:52,987
Is it really possible that our ancestors survived this cold?


77
0:6:52,987 --> 0:6:58,226
After all, their bodies were not made for this climate.


78
0:6:58,226 --> 0:7:3,67
Because the latest research claims that Siberians, along with most humans,


79
0:7:3,67 --> 0:7:7,627
can trace their origins to a tiny group which left Africa


80
0:7:7,627 --> 0:7:10,826
around 70,000 years ago.


81
0:7:10,826 --> 0:7:14,387
A few family groups could have followed the great rivers north,


82
0:7:14,387 --> 0:7:16,867
around and through the Himalayas.


83
0:7:16,867 --> 0:7:19,987
But we just don't know.


84
0:7:19,987 --> 0:7:22,387
All we have is a few stone tools


85
0:7:22,387 --> 0:7:31,346
suggesting someone had reached Siberia by 40,000 years ago.


86
0:7:31,346 --> 0:7:42,586
What could have driven such a tropical species on deeper into the frozen north?


87
0:7:42,586 --> 0:7:55,266
The last half hour of the journey is the longest I have ever experienced.


88
0:7:55,266 --> 0:7:57,586
After what seems like forever,


89
0:7:57,586 --> 0:8:10,146
the Evenki camp finally appears through the trees.


90
0:8:10,146 --> 0:8:11,947
Oh, God!


91
0:8:11,947 --> 0:8:15,826
I don't think I've ever been so cold in my entire life.


92
0:8:15,826 --> 0:8:19,547
That's a six-hour journey.


93
0:8:19,547 --> 0:8:22,146
I saw some of it, but a lot of it I didn't see,


94
0:8:22,146 --> 0:8:23,906
'cause just look at that.


95
0:8:23,906 --> 0:8:25,747
Nothing at all.


96
0:8:25,747 --> 0:8:28,786
Oh, but we're here.


97
0:8:28,786 --> 0:8:47,826
I'm gonna go and get warm.


98
0:8:47,826 --> 0:8:51,586
ROBERTS: I wake up to find the camp in a fever of activity.


99
0:8:51,586 --> 0:8:55,667
Even in bright sunshine, it's still minus 20.


100
0:8:55,667 --> 0:8:59,667
But I feel privileged to be here.


101
0:8:59,667 --> 0:9:3,826
These Evenki are one of the most isolated peoples in the world.


102
0:9:3,826 --> 0:9:10,586
And this is the first time they've allowed their camps to be filmed.


103
0:9:10,586 --> 0:9:12,346
Well, the question that really leaps out


104
0:9:12,346 --> 0:9:14,907
is why on earth did the ancestors of the Evenki


105
0:9:14,907 --> 0:9:16,746
come this far north?


106
0:9:16,746 --> 0:9:19,706
But the answer is obvious. Hunting.


107
0:9:19,706 --> 0:9:23,907
And in fact, although the Evenki today have herds of domesticated reindeer,


108
0:9:23,907 --> 0:9:27,706
they still depend on the wild animals for their meat.


109
0:9:27,706 --> 0:9:31,547
Just as their ancestors did thousands of years ago.


110
0:9:31,547 --> 0:9:35,346
Well, I'm just about to go off on a reindeer hunt.


111
0:9:35,346 --> 0:9:38,106
So, Vasily, have you got a good feeling about the hunt today?


112
0:9:38,106 --> 0:9:42,986
MALE TRANSLATOR: Well, I feel it's going to be a good day.


113
0:9:42,986 --> 0:9:48,106
But you never can tell.


114
0:9:48,106 --> 0:9:50,947
ROBERTS: vasily Stepanov, the brigadier,


115
0:9:50,947 --> 0:9:56,866
leads what's known as a brigade of Evenki herders and hunters.


116
0:9:56,866 --> 0:10:4,506
We know that people have been hunting in Siberia for a very long time,


117
0:10:4,506 --> 0:10:7,907
because scattered across this vast wilderness


118
0:10:7,907 --> 0:10:11,947
archaeologists have discovered ancient butchered reindeer bones,


119
0:10:11,947 --> 0:10:33,586
and tools carved from their antlers.


120
0:10:33,586 --> 0:10:35,907
MALE TRANSLATOR: You can see all these reindeer tracks.


121
0:10:35,907 --> 0:10:39,187
They passed through and went off in that direction.


122
0:10:39,187 --> 0:10:41,506
over there.


123
0:10:41,506 --> 0:10:47,506
(SPEAKING LOCAL LANGUAGE)


124
0:10:47,506 --> 0:10:55,866
ROBERTS: The brigadier reckons they were here recently, but are moving fast.


125
0:10:55,866 --> 0:10:57,547
After some time tracking,


126
0:10:57,547 --> 0:11:6,667
it becomes clear that he won't catch them today.


127
0:11:6,667 --> 0:11:10,586
But his people still need to eat.


128
0:11:10,586 --> 0:11:12,27
So, reluctantly,


129
0:11:12,27 --> 0:11:30,67
they choose one of their domesticated animals for slaughter.


130
0:11:30,67 --> 0:11:34,506
But now, as far as the Evenki people are concerned, it's...


131
0:11:34,506 --> 0:11:36,547
it's dinner.


132
0:11:36,547 --> 0:11:38,106
And the anatomist in me is quite intrigued


133
0:11:38,106 --> 0:11:40,307
to see how they're going to skin it


134
0:11:40,307 --> 0:11:48,187
and how they're going to cut it up.


135
0:11:48,187 --> 0:11:50,27
ROBERTS: Quite interesting, 'cause they're using the knife


136
0:11:50,27 --> 0:11:52,947
with the blade basically facing outwards


137
0:11:52,947 --> 0:11:55,706
so there's no chance of cutting through the deeper tissues.


138
0:11:55,706 --> 0:11:58,346
And it's almost bloodless. I mean, look at that.


139
0:11:58,346 --> 0:12:1,586
That skin is just peeling away.


140
0:12:1,586 --> 0:12:3,466
ROBERTS: For 40,000 years,


141
0:12:3,466 --> 0:12:7,187
a key to survival in this incredibly harsh environment


142
0:12:7,187 --> 0:12:11,267
has been to use every single bit of the reindeer.


143
0:12:11,267 --> 0:12:14,346
The eyes, liver and brain are delicacies.


144
0:12:14,346 --> 0:12:17,427
The antlers are used to boost male potency.


145
0:12:17,427 --> 0:12:20,386
And that's not all.


146
0:12:20,386 --> 0:12:34,626
MALE TRANSLATOR: Alice, it's like French wine.


147
0:12:34,626 --> 0:12:36,147
(ExCLAIMS)


148
0:12:36,147 --> 0:12:41,147
ROBERTS: But food is only one part of survival.


149
0:12:41,147 --> 0:12:43,706
To withstand this terrible cold,


150
0:12:43,706 --> 0:12:49,986
our ancestors had to come up with something really ingenious.


151
0:12:49,986 --> 0:12:52,947
Well, compared to the hunt, what these ladies are doing here


152
0:12:52,947 --> 0:12:54,746
seems a bit frivolous.


153
0:12:54,746 --> 0:12:58,267
But in fact, it's one of the greatest technological advances


154
0:12:58,267 --> 0:13:3,187
the humankind has ever seen.


155
0:13:3,187 --> 0:13:6,466
ROBERTS: our species wasn't designed for this climate.


156
0:13:6,466 --> 0:13:11,147
Yet somehow, uniquely amongst apes, we made it this far north.


157
0:13:11,147 --> 0:13:15,307
And the secret is right here.


158
0:13:15,307 --> 0:13:18,787
Tanya is measuring me up for my very own pair


159
0:13:18,787 --> 0:13:22,267
of reindeer-skin boots.


160
0:13:22,267 --> 0:13:24,787
FEMALE TRANSLATOR: okay, that's it.


161
0:13:24,787 --> 0:13:29,226
I've got your size. Let's get to work.


162
0:13:29,226 --> 0:13:31,746
There's a very specific part


163
0:13:31,746 --> 0:13:34,586
of the reindeer hide that's being used here.


164
0:13:34,586 --> 0:13:36,506
You can see from the shape of it


165
0:13:36,506 --> 0:13:39,267
that it's the fur from the reindeer's legs


166
0:13:39,267 --> 0:13:42,706
that they use to make boots out of.


167
0:13:42,706 --> 0:13:47,787
ROBERTS: But what happens now is the really important bit.


168
0:13:47,787 --> 0:13:50,866
ROBERTS: And this is it. This amazing technology


169
0:13:50,866 --> 0:13:54,586
that makes survival in this harsh environment possible.


170
0:13:54,586 --> 0:13:56,106
Sewing.


171
0:13:56,106 --> 0:14:0,67
And it all depends on having a needle.


172
0:14:0,67 --> 0:14:2,947
Some of the most ancient needles in the world


173
0:14:2,947 --> 0:14:6,106
are found in Siberia.


174
0:14:6,106 --> 0:14:8,547
ROBERTS: We'll never know who it was


175
0:14:8,547 --> 0:14:12,386
that first thought of carving a needle out of bone.


176
0:14:12,386 --> 0:14:26,147
But the oldest one found dates to around 40,000 years ago.


177
0:14:26,147 --> 0:14:28,67
It's no good having a needle


178
0:14:28,67 --> 0:14:30,826
if you don't have tough thread to sew with.


179
0:14:30,826 --> 0:14:33,427
And that comes from the reindeer, too.


180
0:14:33,427 --> 0:14:36,866
(SPEAKING LOCAL LANGUAGE)


181
0:14:36,866 --> 0:14:39,506
FEMALE TRANSLATOR: I'm using sinew from the body of the reindeer


182
0:14:39,506 --> 0:14:42,506
to make threads for sewing clothes together.


183
0:14:42,506 --> 0:14:47,706
If you use these, it's a very sturdy and long-lasting way of sewing things.


184

(SPEAKING LOCAL LANGUAGE)


185
0:14:59,547 --> 0:15:2,466
ROBERTS: It's humbling that this apparently simple approach


186
0:15:2,466 --> 0:15:9,667
still beats synthetic clothing today.


187
0:15:9,667 --> 0:15:14,826
Beautiful! Spasibo.

(WOMAN LAUGHING)


189
0:15:16,706 --> 0:15:18,27
ROBERTS: The needle and thread


190
0:15:18,27 --> 0:15:22,307
made the difference between death and survival.


191
0:15:22,307 --> 0:15:26,307
Tailored clothes meant people who originated in the tropics


192
0:15:26,307 --> 0:15:45,506
could now venture further north than any humans before.


193
0:15:45,506 --> 0:15:50,67
That evening, I get an invitation to join the brigadier's family


194
0:15:50,67 --> 0:15:53,147
as they tuck in to the reindeer killed earlier.


195
0:15:53,147 --> 0:15:56,746
And there isn't much else on the menu.


196
0:15:56,746 --> 0:16:0,307
The Evenki's meaty diet may sound unhealthy,


197
0:16:0,307 --> 0:16:4,547
but it boosts the metabolic rate and raises body temperature.


198
0:16:4,547 --> 0:16:11,267
Basically, it makes them feel warmer.


199
0:16:11,267 --> 0:16:13,226
As the evening moves on,


200
0:16:13,226 --> 0:16:18,386
our conversation turns to an eternal question.


201
0:16:18,386 --> 0:16:21,947
Anatoly, do the Evenki have any stories about creation?


202
0:16:21,947 --> 0:16:26,346
About how they came to be here?


203
0:16:26,346 --> 0:16:30,67
MALE TRANSLATOR: A bird called the loon dived three times into the sea.


204
0:16:30,67 --> 0:16:34,147
And only at the third time it brought a bit of mud.


205
0:16:34,147 --> 0:16:36,706
And from that mud, the earth arose.


206
0:16:36,706 --> 0:16:39,27
And then the mammoth came along.


207
0:16:39,27 --> 0:16:43,427
And with its tusks, it raised the earth still further


208
0:16:43,427 --> 0:16:45,787
and formed the rivers and mountains.


209
0:16:45,787 --> 0:17:9,666
So this is our beautiful story about the creation of the Earth.


210
0:17:9,666 --> 0:17:12,826
(CLANGING)


211
0:17:12,826 --> 0:17:14,267
ROBERTS: I feel I understand


212
0:17:14,267 --> 0:17:17,826
how our ancestors would have been able to survive here.


213
0:17:17,826 --> 0:17:20,666
But the consequence of having to follow their food


214
0:17:20,666 --> 0:17:27,866
would have been an endlessly nomadic lifestyle.


215
0:17:27,866 --> 0:17:29,707
All this commotion around.


216
0:17:29,707 --> 0:17:33,747
People are literally packing down their homes and moving off.


217
0:17:33,747 --> 0:17:36,346
And this is what a nomadic lifestyle is all about.


218
0:17:36,346 --> 0:17:37,946
These people have to move.


219
0:17:37,946 --> 0:17:51,507
They have to take their reindeer to new pastures.


220
0:17:51,507 --> 0:17:54,267
ROBERTS: The only thing the reindeer eat in winter


221
0:17:54,267 --> 0:17:56,626
is lichen under the snow.


222
0:17:56,626 --> 0:17:58,787
And they get through it very fast.


223
0:17:58,787 --> 0:18:1,467
So they're constantly on the move to find more.


224
0:18:1,467 --> 0:18:4,626
And the humans follow them.


225
0:18:4,626 --> 0:18:8,267
This is just amazing. We've got this caravan of reindeer sleighs


226
0:18:8,267 --> 0:18:10,186
carrying everything from the camp.


227
0:18:10,186 --> 0:18:14,906
And the entire herd, hundreds and hundreds of reindeer,


228
0:18:14,906 --> 0:18:34,507
are following us.


229
0:18:34,507 --> 0:18:37,346
ROBERTS: Finally, the reindeer stop, and so do we.


230
0:18:37,346 --> 0:18:41,386
Everybody joins in to put up the tchum.


231
0:18:41,386 --> 0:18:45,507
There are so few people around the world who still live like this,


232
0:18:45,507 --> 0:18:48,186
but once we were all nomads.


233
0:18:48,186 --> 0:18:58,467
ROBERTS: That's got to go on by itself.


234
0:18:58,467 --> 0:19:1,747
So what we've seen today is a nomadic lifestyle in action.


235
0:19:1,747 --> 0:19:5,386
We've seen a whole village being dismantled and moved on.


236
0:19:5,386 --> 0:19:8,227
And it took about 1 0 minutes to put this tchum up,


237
0:19:8,227 --> 0:19:11,27
and it's made of large poles and reindeer skin,


238
0:19:11,27 --> 0:19:13,27
the sort of materials that would have been available


239
0:19:13,27 --> 0:19:15,307
thousands and thousands of years ago.


240
0:19:15,307 --> 0:19:20,906
This is a very ancient way of life.


241
0:19:20,906 --> 0:19:23,987
ROBERTS: And it seems that for over 1 0,000 years


242
0:19:23,987 --> 0:19:29,146
this life on the move took family groups right across Siberia.


243
0:19:29,146 --> 0:19:33,826
Recent discoveries tell us that they reached the edge of the Arctic ocean


244
0:19:33,826 --> 0:19:39,707
nearly 30,000 years ago.


245
0:19:39,707 --> 0:19:46,106
Humans survived here for thousands of years.


246
0:19:46,106 --> 0:19:52,146
But then a dramatic turn of events changed their journey through Asia -


247
0:19:52,146 --> 0:19:57,426
the peak of the Ice Age.


248
0:19:57,426 --> 0:20:3,707
The latest climate research reveals what happened 25,000 years ago,


249
0:20:3,707 --> 0:20:8,27
as the Ice Age really took hold.


250
0:20:8,27 --> 0:20:12,787
In places, the temperature reached as low as minus 80.


251
0:20:12,787 --> 0:20:16,386
And it became unimaginably dry.


252
0:20:16,386 --> 0:20:23,946
Such extremes are impossible to survive.


253
0:20:23,946 --> 0:20:40,227
So what happened to these men, women and children?


254
0:20:40,227 --> 0:20:52,346
St Petersburg, the former imperial capital of Russia.


255
0:20:52,346 --> 0:20:56,586
The Hermitage is one of the world's greatest museums,


256
0:20:56,586 --> 0:21:8,67
home to some of the most celebrated works of art.


257
0:21:8,67 --> 0:21:10,866
But there's something else here, too.


258
0:21:10,866 --> 0:21:19,346
It's not on display, but it's every bit as precious.


259
0:21:19,346 --> 0:21:21,186
Here, in the storerooms,


260
0:21:21,186 --> 0:21:25,67
are a few objects that could unlock the secrets


261
0:21:25,67 --> 0:21:33,626
of those Siberian families struggling in the depths of the Ice Age.


262
0:21:33,626 --> 0:21:35,906
What is really striking about these objects


263
0:21:35,906 --> 0:21:38,27
from the height of the last Ice Age


264
0:21:38,27 --> 0:21:42,186
is that they're found in just a few places in the south of Siberia.


265
0:21:42,186 --> 0:21:46,106
Which is interesting because it suggests that as the climate worsened,


266
0:21:46,106 --> 0:21:49,547
these prehistoric people retreated into refuges


267
0:21:49,547 --> 0:21:52,227
where it still would have been very cold,


268
0:21:52,227 --> 0:21:55,906
but they would have been just able to survive.


269
0:21:55,906 --> 0:22:0,106
ROBERTS: People vanished from the frozen wastes of northern Siberia,


270
0:22:0,106 --> 0:22:1,507
to the south.


271
0:22:1,507 --> 0:22:8,426
one of the refuges they gathered in is now called Mal'ta.


272
0:22:8,426 --> 0:22:11,547
So can the few remains found here


273
0:22:11,547 --> 0:22:15,507
tell us anything about what happened?


274
0:22:15,507 --> 0:22:19,586
Just look at these tiny blades from the Ice Age.


275
0:22:19,586 --> 0:22:21,946
They are unusually small.


276
0:22:21,946 --> 0:22:25,426
And the archaeologists think this is because the appalling cold


277
0:22:25,426 --> 0:22:27,946
made it difficult to reach the quarries,


278
0:22:27,946 --> 0:22:31,426
so the stone itself was such a precious resource


279
0:22:31,426 --> 0:22:32,987
that they were using it to its utmost,


280
0:22:32,987 --> 0:22:36,186
getting as many blades as they could out of it.


281
0:22:36,186 --> 0:22:42,346
So the blades themselves got smaller and smaller.


282
0:22:42,346 --> 0:22:46,547
And something extraordinary was happening during this period.


283
0:22:46,547 --> 0:22:52,866
In spite of that struggle for survival, there was a blossoming of art.


284
0:22:52,866 --> 0:22:56,27
Now, we may never know


285
0:22:56,27 --> 0:22:59,386
the meaning of this beautiful pair of swans


286
0:22:59,386 --> 0:23:1,507
to the people that made them,


287
0:23:1,507 --> 0:23:6,106
but archaeologists have suggested that they might be hunting charms.


288
0:23:6,106 --> 0:23:10,186
That when the first swans flew, the first deer would appear,


289
0:23:10,186 --> 0:23:13,626
and it was the beginning of the spring hunting season.


290
0:23:13,626 --> 0:23:18,987
And how they must have longed for spring.


291
0:23:18,987 --> 0:23:22,866
ROBERTS: Many of the objects in this collection are mysterious.


292
0:23:22,866 --> 0:23:27,946
This unique plate is made from mammoth ivory.


293
0:23:27,946 --> 0:23:30,227
Some have suggested it's a map


294
0:23:30,227 --> 0:23:33,507
showing the physical and spiritual worlds,


295
0:23:33,507 --> 0:23:44,906
with the connection between them symbolised by a hole in the middle.


296
0:23:44,906 --> 0:23:47,507
These precious bone figurines


297
0:23:47,507 --> 0:23:52,27
are among the earliest depictions of people wearing fur -


298
0:23:52,27 --> 0:23:55,787
further proof that plenty of these Asian pioneers


299
0:23:55,787 --> 0:24:4,626
could sew clothes by this time.


300
0:24:4,626 --> 0:24:11,426
(CAMERA CLICKS)


301
0:24:11,426 --> 0:24:12,787
And finally, there are


302
0:24:12,787 --> 0:24:16,426
these delicate and beautiful little statues of women.


303
0:24:16,426 --> 0:24:19,666
And some of them are pierced, so they may have been worn as pendants,


304
0:24:19,666 --> 0:24:24,267
perhaps amulets.


305
0:24:24,267 --> 0:24:26,826
It's possible that they're fertility symbols,


306
0:24:26,826 --> 0:24:30,106
really underlining the importance and difficulty


307
0:24:30,106 --> 0:24:35,467
of producing children during such harsh conditions.


308
0:24:35,467 --> 0:24:37,227
And in fact, some archaeologists


309
0:24:37,227 --> 0:24:40,987
see this entire, very beautiful collection


310
0:24:40,987 --> 0:24:49,626
as a cry to the spirits in a time of stress and struggle.


311
0:24:49,626 --> 0:24:52,906
ROBERTS: It is amazing to think of those ancient people,


312
0:24:52,906 --> 0:24:56,227
who after all originated in a much warmer place,


313
0:24:56,227 --> 0:25:4,386
surviving in Ice Age Siberia.


314
0:25:4,386 --> 0:25:9,27
But it seems that around this time something else happened to them.


315
0:25:9,27 --> 0:25:17,67
Something which is much more difficult to explain.


316
0:25:17,67 --> 0:25:21,586
This is our best guess as to what our African ancestors looked like.


317
0:25:21,586 --> 0:25:24,787
This reconstruction is based on the skull of a woman


318
0:25:24,787 --> 0:25:29,426
who lived over 1 00,000 years ago.


319
0:25:29,426 --> 0:25:33,307
But sometime around the peak of the last Ice Age,


320
0:25:33,307 --> 0:25:38,707
the faces of the people of East Asia changed.


321
0:25:38,707 --> 0:25:50,666
Why?


322
0:25:50,666 --> 0:25:53,386
Today, from Siberia to Hong Kong,


323
0:25:53,386 --> 0:25:58,507
you come face to face with these changes.


324
0:25:58,507 --> 0:26:4,906
Almond-shaped eyes, a flatter face, a smaller nose.


325
0:26:4,906 --> 0:26:8,987
Most of all, we associate these features with China.


326
0:26:8,987 --> 0:26:12,386
And here they have become the subject of great interest -


327
0:26:12,386 --> 0:26:19,27
not to scientists, but to the beauty industry.


328
0:26:19,27 --> 0:26:20,826
ROBERTS: For cosmetics companies,


329
0:26:20,826 --> 0:26:25,27
understanding variation in people's faces can be big business.


330
0:26:25,27 --> 0:26:27,186
Now, during the Cultural Revolution


331
0:26:27,186 --> 0:26:30,386
Chinese women were forbidden from wearing make-up,


332
0:26:30,386 --> 0:26:39,547
but now China is one of the biggest markets in the world.


333
0:26:39,547 --> 0:26:41,27
Secret filming.


334
0:26:41,27 --> 0:26:43,346
ROBERTS: Here's one multinational that's in there


335
0:26:43,346 --> 0:26:46,626
trying to convince the Chinese to use their products.


336
0:26:46,626 --> 0:26:51,227
Crystal, she has a very traditional Chinese eye.


337
0:26:51,227 --> 0:26:55,267
So what I need to do is make her eye look bigger and more attractive.


338
0:26:55,267 --> 0:26:57,987
So you're actually trying to make her look less Chinese?


339
0:26:57,987 --> 0:26:59,146
No!


340
0:26:59,146 --> 0:27:6,467
(BOTH LAUGHING)


341
0:27:6,467 --> 0:27:8,626
ROBERTS: They claim to have some insight


342
0:27:8,626 --> 0:27:11,747
into what is special about the Chinese face.


343
0:27:11,747 --> 0:27:15,707
I'm curious, if a little suspicious.


344
0:27:15,707 --> 0:27:18,146
Now, in here is the wrinkle laboratory


345
0:27:18,146 --> 0:27:23,946
where they grade your wrinkles from nought to six.


346
0:27:23,946 --> 0:27:27,547
ROBERTS: The company is trying to compare the way skin ages


347
0:27:27,547 --> 0:27:30,67
in European and Chinese women.


348
0:27:30,67 --> 0:27:33,106
Sit down, please.


349
0:27:33,106 --> 0:27:35,826
This is all rather clinical-looking and scary, isn't it?


350
0:27:35,826 --> 0:27:38,186
ROBERTS: Carole wants to assess my wrinkles


351
0:27:38,186 --> 0:27:41,826
and contrast them with a Chinese woman of the same age.


352
0:27:41,826 --> 0:27:43,707
-Grade one. -Grade one?


353
0:27:43,707 --> 0:27:46,146
CAROLE: Yes. ROBERTS: That's good.


354
0:27:46,146 --> 0:27:49,426
CAROLE: That's lateral folds.


355
0:27:49,426 --> 0:27:53,346
Grade two. Crow's-feet wrinkle.


356
0:27:53,346 --> 0:27:56,626
Grade one. You have very little wrinkle


357
0:27:56,626 --> 0:27:58,586
-for your age. -ROBERTS: Excellent!


358
0:27:58,586 --> 0:28:1,267
I've paid Carole to say that.


359
0:28:1,267 --> 0:28:2,906
Thank you very much.


360
0:28:2,906 --> 0:28:5,267
So how does the Chinese woman do?


361
0:28:5,267 --> 0:28:9,547
CAROLE: Grade one, grade two, grade one.


362
0:28:9,547 --> 0:28:12,186
-Thank you very much, Carole. -You're welcome.


363
0:28:12,186 --> 0:28:16,747
ROBERTS: At our age, Carole sees very little difference.


364
0:28:16,747 --> 0:28:19,67
But what happens 1 0 years later?


365
0:28:19,67 --> 0:28:23,426
This is a 4 7-year-old European.


366
0:28:23,426 --> 0:28:27,586
This is grade four.


367
0:28:27,586 --> 0:28:29,787
Grade three.


368
0:28:29,787 --> 0:28:32,666
Grade four.


369
0:28:32,666 --> 0:28:36,826
ROBERTS: Compare her with a 4 7-year-old Chinese woman.


370
0:28:36,826 --> 0:28:42,227
Grade two. It's grade one.


371
0:28:42,227 --> 0:28:45,826
Grade one.


372
0:28:45,826 --> 0:28:50,386
There's a suggestion that Chinese skin ages more slowly.


373
0:28:50,386 --> 0:28:53,507
I'd need a lot more evidence to be convinced.


374
0:28:53,507 --> 0:28:56,106
But that's not nearly as controversial


375
0:28:56,106 --> 0:29:0,507
as the whole question of where Chinese features came from


376
0:29:0,507 --> 0:29:2,547
in the first place.


377
0:29:2,547 --> 0:29:6,386
It's one of the most fascinating and perplexing questions


378
0:29:6,386 --> 0:29:13,67
of our human origins.


379
0:29:13,67 --> 0:29:16,346
Some have suggested that these facial characteristics,


380
0:29:16,346 --> 0:29:20,906
like narrower eyes, smaller noses and flatter faces,


381
0:29:20,906 --> 0:29:23,707
could have been adaptations to cold,


382
0:29:23,707 --> 0:29:32,426
protecting the eyes and reducing heat loss from the face.


383
0:29:32,426 --> 0:29:34,787
It's an alluring idea.


384
0:29:34,787 --> 0:29:39,987
The problem is, there's no evidence for it.


385
0:29:39,987 --> 0:29:44,866
But there are many people in China who believe there's another explanation


386
0:29:44,866 --> 0:29:46,547
for the way they look.


387
0:29:46,547 --> 0:29:56,626
And their theory, if proved true, could be absolutely explosive.


388
0:29:56,626 --> 0:29:59,586
ROBERTS: It would mean we'd have to totally rethink our ideas


389
0:29:59,586 --> 0:30:6,507
about how Asia, and indeed the whole world, became populated.


390
0:30:6,507 --> 0:30:9,426
Many Chinese people believe that they look different


391
0:30:9,426 --> 0:30:13,27
because they are fundamentally different from the rest of us.


392
0:30:13,27 --> 0:30:16,747
The claim is that they come from a completely separate branch


393
0:30:16,747 --> 0:30:18,826
of the human family tree,


394
0:30:18,826 --> 0:30:22,626
and that they descend from an ancient type of human


395
0:30:22,626 --> 0:30:31,626
who arrived here in China nearly two million years ago.


396
0:30:31,626 --> 0:30:34,626
ROBERTS: Before we modern humans existed,


397
0:30:34,626 --> 0:30:37,67
there were earlier species of human,


398
0:30:37,67 --> 0:30:39,346
such as Homo erectus.


399
0:30:39,346 --> 0:30:41,547
A bit more ape-like than us, perhaps,


400
0:30:41,547 --> 0:30:46,586
with a heavy brow and a smaller brain.


401
0:30:46,586 --> 0:30:49,547
About 1.8 million years ago,


402
0:30:49,547 --> 0:30:54,747
the Homo erectus population started spilling out of Africa.


403
0:30:54,747 --> 0:30:56,426
I always believed


404
0:30:56,426 --> 0:31:0,906
that Homo erectus in Asia eventually died out,


405
0:31:0,906 --> 0:31:5,507
while Homo erectus in Africa ultimately evolved into us,


406
0:31:5,507 --> 0:31:8,146
Homo sapiens.


407
0:31:8,146 --> 0:31:13,906
Then, around 70,000 years ago, a tiny group left -


408
0:31:13,906 --> 0:31:18,987
ancestors of everyone outside Africa today.


409
0:31:18,987 --> 0:31:46,386
But in China they think this is completely wrong.


410
0:31:46,386 --> 0:31:49,386
I've come to zhoukoudian, near Beijing,


411
0:31:49,386 --> 0:31:51,866
where the Chinese say they have evidence


412
0:31:51,866 --> 0:31:55,866
that Homo erectus in Asia did not die out,


413
0:31:55,866 --> 0:32:4,186
but is in fact their ancestor.


414
0:32:4,186 --> 0:32:7,626
They believe passionately in their separate origin,


415
0:32:7,626 --> 0:32:17,787
and it's something everyone in China is taught from childhood.


416
0:32:17,787 --> 0:32:19,626
It's such an amazing idea,


417
0:32:19,626 --> 0:32:22,467
that the Chinese originate from a different branch


418
0:32:22,467 --> 0:32:25,386
of the human family tree from the rest of us.


419
0:32:25,386 --> 0:32:34,227
And it goes against everything I've discovered so far.


420
0:32:34,227 --> 0:32:36,826
ROBERTS: It was here, early last century,


421
0:32:36,826 --> 0:32:46,586
that the most important evidence behind this idea was discovered.


422
0:32:46,586 --> 0:32:48,906
So this is the cave itself?


423
0:32:48,906 --> 0:32:53,186
one of China's most revered scientists is Professor Wu xinzhi.


424
0:32:53,186 --> 0:32:57,946
He's dedicated his life to studying what was found here.


425
0:32:57,946 --> 0:33:1,747
-This cave named Pigeon Cave. -Pigeon Cave?


426
0:33:1,747 --> 0:33:5,27
Because here usually there are many pigeons...


427
0:33:5,27 --> 0:33:6,547
ROBERTS: Right. WU: ...living here.


428
0:33:6,547 --> 0:33:12,547
And the main fossils were found over there.


429
0:33:12,547 --> 0:33:17,267
ROBERTS: Half a million years ago, this huge pit was a cave.


430
0:33:17,267 --> 0:33:20,906
And it's here that archaeologists found a treasure trove,


431
0:33:20,906 --> 0:33:24,987
incredibly rare evidence of a long-lost world.


432
0:33:24,987 --> 0:33:29,547
The largest collection of Homo erectus fossils ever unearthed.


433
0:33:29,547 --> 0:33:33,586
The oldest skull is about half a million years old.


434
0:33:33,586 --> 0:33:34,987
-Really? -Yes.


435
0:33:34,987 --> 0:33:39,106
And the youngest one is between


436
0:33:39,106 --> 0:33:43,666
200 and 300,000 years old.


437
0:33:43,666 --> 0:33:45,267
So they were living here for...


438
0:33:45,267 --> 0:33:49,787
For around 300,000 years.


439
0:33:49,787 --> 0:33:51,386
-Right. -A long time.


440
0:33:51,386 --> 0:33:56,787
So I believe this is the home base of Homo erectus.


441
0:33:56,787 --> 0:33:57,906
ROBERTS: Right.


442
0:33:57,906 --> 0:34:1,747
Professor Wu is sure that Asian Homo erectus evolved here


443
0:34:1,747 --> 0:34:3,747
into the modern Chinese.


444
0:34:3,747 --> 0:34:5,227
And a few metres away,


445
0:34:5,227 --> 0:34:10,106
he shows me where some really crucial evidence was found.


446
0:34:10,106 --> 0:34:14,67
Here, in what is called the Upper Cave, they found more skulls,


447
0:34:14,67 --> 0:34:17,387
but these ones were quite different.


448
0:34:17,387 --> 0:34:23,586
This is Upper Cave. Many human skeletons was found here.


449
0:34:23,586 --> 0:34:26,347
30,000 years old.


450
0:34:26,347 --> 0:34:29,467
ROBERTS: The skulls clearly belonged to our species,


451
0:34:29,467 --> 0:34:32,827
but the researchers saw something surprising, too -


452
0:34:32,827 --> 0:34:36,987
they appeared to share some features with the Homo erectus skulls.


453
0:34:36,987 --> 0:34:42,786
There are many common features among them.


454
0:34:42,786 --> 0:34:48,27
And I think it is most probable that


455
0:34:48,27 --> 0:34:56,266
Upper Cave men are the descendants of Homo erectus.


456
0:34:56,266 --> 0:34:58,947
ROBERTS: Wu believes that Asian Homo erectus


457
0:34:58,947 --> 0:35:1,666
evolved into the humans found in the Upper Cave,


458
0:35:1,666 --> 0:35:4,987
and that they evolved into the modern Chinese.


459
0:35:4,987 --> 0:35:9,67
So, for him, Upper Cave Man is a sort of missing link,


460
0:35:9,67 --> 0:35:15,266
proof the Chinese do descend from Homo erectus.


461
0:35:15,266 --> 0:35:17,987
I'd love to see those ancient skulls,


462
0:35:17,987 --> 0:35:21,746
but tragically, in the mayhem of the second World War,


463
0:35:21,746 --> 0:35:29,827
the whole collection went missing.


464
0:35:29,827 --> 0:35:33,827
Luckily, before they were lost, plaster casts were made,


465
0:35:33,827 --> 0:35:38,867
and now even these copies are considered priceless.


466
0:35:38,867 --> 0:35:41,867
(LAUGHING) So, this is the exhibition room.


467
0:35:41,867 --> 0:35:42,987
Right.


468
0:35:42,987 --> 0:35:46,746
ROBERTS: Chinese scientists come here to study the history of their people.


469
0:35:46,746 --> 0:35:49,987
But the casts I want to see are securely locked away.


470
0:35:49,987 --> 0:35:52,67
I will ask him to take out.


471
0:35:52,67 --> 0:35:53,266
Oh, please do.


472
0:35:53,266 --> 0:35:55,27
(SPEAKING MANDARIN)


473
0:35:55,27 --> 0:35:57,27
I think I'm going to have to remove myself actually,


474
0:35:57,27 --> 0:36:0,266
because I'm not allowed to see the drawers that the skulls come out of.


475
0:36:0,266 --> 0:36:4,547
So, I'm just gonna come and stand back here discreetly.


476
0:36:4,547 --> 0:36:5,706
(WU LAUGHING)


477
0:36:5,706 --> 0:36:10,306
Wait for the skulls to appear.


478
0:36:10,306 --> 0:36:11,987
It's sort of layers of security.


479
0:36:11,987 --> 0:36:14,626
We're not allowed to see which key goes into which locker.


480
0:36:14,626 --> 0:36:21,146
He keeps the key so that nobody to know the number.


481
0:36:21,146 --> 0:36:22,666
-Do you know the numbers? -No.


482
0:36:22,666 --> 0:36:24,827
(LAUGHS) No? Even Professor Wu doesn't know.


483
0:36:24,827 --> 0:36:30,67
No, I do not want to know, because if I know that,


484
0:36:30,67 --> 0:36:34,306
if it is lost, I have the responsibility.


485
0:36:34,306 --> 0:36:37,507
-Yes. -But now I don't know anything.


486
0:36:37,507 --> 0:36:41,786
-Right. -No responsibility for me.


487
0:36:41,786 --> 0:36:44,547
ROBERTS: Finally I'm allowed in to see the plaster casts


488
0:36:44,547 --> 0:36:47,626
of the Homo erectus skulls from the Lower Cave.


489
0:36:47,626 --> 0:36:50,67
And Professor Wu has a surprise waiting.


490
0:36:50,67 --> 0:36:51,427
(ROBERTS ExCLAIMS)


491
0:36:51,427 --> 0:36:54,427
You see, this is the original specimen.


492
0:36:54,427 --> 0:36:55,547
That's the original?


493
0:36:55,547 --> 0:36:57,146
Yes, original.


494
0:36:57,146 --> 0:37:1,547
As you know, most of the original specimens lost during the war.


495
0:37:1,547 --> 0:37:3,907
I didn't know any of it had survived.


496
0:37:3,907 --> 0:37:9,106
Yeah, after the war we have done some new excavation.


497
0:37:9,106 --> 0:37:12,186
-ROBERTS: Right. -And got some new specimens.


498
0:37:12,186 --> 0:37:13,706
-This is one of them. -Can I hold it?


499
0:37:13,706 --> 0:37:16,947
Yes, yes.


500
0:37:16,947 --> 0:37:19,266
I honestly thought all the specimens had been lost,


501
0:37:19,266 --> 0:37:23,306
but this is an actual fossil of Homo erectus in China.


502
0:37:23,306 --> 0:37:26,226
It was found in 1 966.


503
0:37:26,226 --> 0:37:31,507
ROBERTS: So this is hundreds of thousands of years old, isn't it?


504
0:37:31,507 --> 0:37:37,666
WU: So this is another piece.


505
0:37:37,666 --> 0:37:41,106
It's just amazing for me to, I mean, to be holding in my hand


506
0:37:41,106 --> 0:37:44,226
this actual fossil, which is hundreds of thousands of years old.


507
0:37:44,226 --> 0:37:48,347
I honestly thought all I would see is casts, is reconstructions.


508
0:37:48,347 --> 0:37:50,347
-WU: Yeah, yeah. -And this is the actual fossil.


509
0:37:50,347 --> 0:37:52,347
WU: And now you hold original one.


510
0:37:52,347 --> 0:37:58,226
That's amazing.


511
0:37:58,226 --> 0:37:59,827
ROBERTS: But even more important


512
0:37:59,827 --> 0:38:5,387
is what Professor Wu has spotted in these fossils.


513
0:38:5,387 --> 0:38:9,266
First, he shows me some features of the ancient Erectus skulls


514
0:38:9,266 --> 0:38:13,467
that he believes are typically Chinese.


515
0:38:13,467 --> 0:38:20,427
The face is flat. The nose is flat. Not very protrude, as in Europe.


516
0:38:20,427 --> 0:38:21,626
ROBERTS: Yeah, yeah.


517
0:38:21,626 --> 0:38:26,427
And this part is also flat.


518
0:38:26,427 --> 0:38:29,467
So, this part of the cheek bones is sort of rotated like that.


519
0:38:29,467 --> 0:38:32,987
Then he shows me the much more recent Upper Cave skulls


520
0:38:32,987 --> 0:38:37,467
and picks out the same distinctively Chinese features.


521
0:38:37,467 --> 0:38:41,507
WU: But it also have the more flat face


522
0:38:41,507 --> 0:38:44,67
and a not very protruding nose.


523
0:38:44,67 --> 0:38:47,467
So the features that you're looking at in these skulls are really


524
0:38:47,467 --> 0:38:51,106
the features which characterise modern Chinese people today,


525
0:38:51,106 --> 0:38:53,266
and the sort of differences between your skull and my skull.


526
0:38:53,266 --> 0:38:54,586
-WU: Yes, yes. -Yeah.


527
0:38:54,586 --> 0:38:58,106
-Yeah, so your face here is like this. -Yeah.


528
0:38:58,106 --> 0:39:0,467
-And mine like... -And yours is flatter.


529
0:39:0,467 --> 0:39:1,586
-Yes. -ROBERTS: Yeah.


530
0:39:1,586 --> 0:39:3,266
And your nose is flatter here than mine.


531
0:39:3,266 --> 0:39:9,507
So we inherited some features from our ancestor.


532
0:39:9,507 --> 0:39:12,186
ROBERTS: Professor Wu sees a clear line,


533
0:39:12,186 --> 0:39:18,626
Homo erectus evolving into Upper Cave Man, becoming today's Chinese.


534
0:39:18,626 --> 0:39:21,706
For him, these fossils prove that the Chinese


535
0:39:21,706 --> 0:39:27,507
come from a completely different branch of the human family.


536
0:39:27,507 --> 0:39:33,626
But I can see significant differences between the skulls.


537
0:39:33,626 --> 0:39:39,666
The whole skull shape of Homo erectus is quite different from modern humans.


538
0:39:39,666 --> 0:39:42,666
And even those features that Wu pointed out,


539
0:39:42,666 --> 0:39:54,27
the nose and the cheek bones, don't seem that similar to me.


540
0:39:54,27 --> 0:39:57,987
Professor Wu, I mean, you've spent a lifetime studying these skulls,


541
0:39:57,987 --> 0:40:0,947
and I'm a complete novice in comparison,


542
0:40:0,947 --> 0:40:4,27
but I look at this modern skull here,


543
0:40:4,27 --> 0:40:7,226
this 30,000-year-old skull from zhoukoudian,


544
0:40:7,226 --> 0:40:13,306
and this looks quite similar to me to other skulls from Europe


545
0:40:13,306 --> 0:40:17,547
at the same time, so I don't think... It doesn't look Chinese to me.


546
0:40:17,547 --> 0:40:21,626
No, but the profile in Europe is different.


547
0:40:21,626 --> 0:40:30,907
Quite subtle though, isn't it?


548
0:40:30,907 --> 0:40:36,226
I'm still not convinced that the Chinese are so fundamentally different


549
0:40:36,226 --> 0:40:38,186
from the rest of us.


550
0:40:38,186 --> 0:40:42,987
Professor Wu is so knowledgeable and his arguments are so persuasive,


551
0:40:42,987 --> 0:40:46,347
so maybe I'm missing something.


552
0:40:46,347 --> 0:40:49,427
ROBERTS: And there is other evidence to suggest that Professor Wu


553
0:40:49,427 --> 0:40:50,907
could be right,


554
0:40:50,907 --> 0:40:55,146
that the Chinese do in fact descend from a different branch of the human family


555
0:40:55,146 --> 0:41:9,547
to the rest of us.


556
0:41:9,547 --> 0:41:13,467
I'm travelling 2,000 kilometres into Central China,


557
0:41:13,467 --> 0:41:16,467
to investigate something that's a real problem


558
0:41:16,467 --> 0:41:20,106
for my out of Africa theory.


559
0:41:20,106 --> 0:41:27,146
And it's all to do with stone tools.


560
0:41:27,146 --> 0:41:30,827
Elsewhere in the world, our species, Homo sapiens,


561
0:41:30,827 --> 0:41:34,186
is associated with sophisticated styles of tools.


562
0:41:34,186 --> 0:41:36,266
Like these from Europe.


563
0:41:36,266 --> 0:41:42,507
But in China, you find something completely different.


564
0:41:42,507 --> 0:41:50,947
A lot of very basic tools. A type in fact typical of Homo erectus.


565
0:41:50,947 --> 0:41:55,27
Archaeological evidence, then, that seems to undermine the idea


566
0:41:55,27 --> 0:42:0,146
that the Chinese evolved in the same way as the rest of us.


567
0:42:0,146 --> 0:42:2,786
If modern humans suddenly arrived in China,


568
0:42:2,786 --> 0:42:6,306
we might expect to see modern-looking stone tools


569
0:42:6,306 --> 0:42:9,746
appearing with their arrival, just like in Europe.


570
0:42:9,746 --> 0:42:15,67
But the tools in this part of the world stay looking fairly crude.


571
0:42:15,67 --> 0:42:16,746
And Chinese scientists say


572
0:42:16,746 --> 0:42:20,786
this is because there wasn't an influx of modern humans.


573
0:42:20,786 --> 0:42:33,186
But there could be another rather intriguing explanation.


574
0:42:33,186 --> 0:42:35,226
ROBERTS: Archaeologist Dr Joe Kaminga


575
0:42:35,226 --> 0:42:38,387
has spent decades working in Southeast Asia.


576
0:42:38,387 --> 0:42:41,907
And I'm hoping that his work might shed some light


577
0:42:41,907 --> 0:42:45,626
on this mystery of Chinese origins.


578
0:42:45,626 --> 0:42:49,146
I mean, this really is about as crude and basic a stone tool


579
0:42:49,146 --> 0:42:50,467
as you can get, isn't it?


580
0:42:50,467 --> 0:42:51,626
Yes, it is.


581
0:42:51,626 --> 0:42:54,226
Which is a bit bizarre, isn't it? Because in Europe


582
0:42:54,226 --> 0:42:57,507
at this time they're making quite sophisticated stone tools.


583
0:42:57,507 --> 0:42:59,226
So, I mean, what's going on here?


584
0:42:59,226 --> 0:43:1,467
We're in a completely different part of the world here.


585
0:43:1,467 --> 0:43:4,27
In Europe, there are different resources, different plants,


586
0:43:4,27 --> 0:43:6,827
different animals and different kinds of stone.


587
0:43:6,827 --> 0:43:9,146
And you have very large cobbles of flint in Europe,


588
0:43:9,146 --> 0:43:12,146
but you don't have very large cobbles of flint here in Southeast Asia


589
0:43:12,146 --> 0:43:15,867
or in South China.


590
0:43:15,867 --> 0:43:17,586
ROBERTS: But there is something else here,


591
0:43:17,586 --> 0:43:20,347
and Joe thinks they could've used it to make tools


592
0:43:20,347 --> 0:43:25,666
just as sophisticated as European ones.


593
0:43:25,666 --> 0:43:29,867
Bamboo.


594
0:43:29,867 --> 0:43:33,706
Why would you go through so much trouble to make a sophisticated stone tool,


595
0:43:33,706 --> 0:43:36,306
beautifully shaped, when you can just take a piece of bamboo


596
0:43:36,306 --> 0:43:38,786
and use that, and throw it away when you've finished with it?


597
0:43:38,786 --> 0:43:47,467
Because it's everywhere. You can always get it again, next valley along.


598
0:43:47,467 --> 0:43:51,666
ROBERTS: Joe believes that the crude stone tools were just used to chop down


599
0:43:51,666 --> 0:43:53,306
and work bamboo.

0:44:13,186 --> 0:44:15,146
JOE: Perfect.


610
0:44:15,146 --> 0:44:17,387
ROBERTS: It's a tantalising idea,


611
0:44:17,387 --> 0:44:20,706
but it's not easy to believe that a flimsy bit of bamboo


612
0:44:20,706 --> 0:44:24,666
could ever do the job of a sharp stone tool.


613
0:44:24,666 --> 0:44:26,467
We need to put it to the test.


614
0:44:26,467 --> 0:44:29,507
If you just want to make a small knife, we've got a flake.


615
0:44:29,507 --> 0:44:31,106
-Right. -Just saw it.


616
0:44:31,106 --> 0:44:37,586
You can open up the cut by bending the bamboo.


617
0:44:37,586 --> 0:44:41,67
The next step is simply to thin the edge.


618
0:44:41,67 --> 0:44:44,706
And just cut... cut it on the inside of the bamboo.


619
0:44:44,706 --> 0:44:46,106
And it should work very well.


620
0:44:46,106 --> 0:44:48,827
It has a completely different texture to wood.


621
0:44:48,827 --> 0:44:53,547
The fibres are very long, very even. Everything's very predictable.


622
0:44:53,547 --> 0:44:55,827
-There's no knots in it. -ROBERTS: No.


623
0:44:55,827 --> 0:44:59,347
And it's as simple as that. 'Cause I think I'm about done.


624
0:44:59,347 --> 0:45:0,987
ROBERTS: Really? JOE: Yeah.


625
0:45:0,987 --> 0:45:3,106
And behold.


626
0:45:3,106 --> 0:45:5,827
It's pretty sharp stuff.


627
0:45:5,827 --> 0:45:8,347
ROBERTS: Bamboo's sharpness comes from silica,


628
0:45:8,347 --> 0:45:12,67
a hard mineral also found in sand.


629
0:45:12,67 --> 0:45:15,306
I'm not sure if I'm going to be able to...


630
0:45:15,306 --> 0:45:17,507
butcher a chicken with it, though.

I'm making an arrow head.

JOE: So I'll just start to shape the point.


635

ROBERTS: We don't know if ancient people used bamboo arrow heads,


636
0:45:33,106 --> 0:45:40,106
but it seemed like a good way to test the limits of bamboo technology.


637
0:45:40,106 --> 0:45:41,867
A very snug fit.


638
0:45:41,867 --> 0:45:44,27

641
0:45:52,387 --> 0:45:54,306
So this is going to be somebody's dinner, hopefully.


642
0:45:54,306 --> 0:45:57,387
Well, maybe ours.


643
0:45:57,387 --> 0:46:3,427
-All right. -Okay, I'll have a leg.

Oh, this is pretty good, Joe. Look at this.

0:46:15,427 --> 0:46:18,266
JOE: Good.


648
0:46:18,266 --> 0:46:20,786
Well, we've just disjointed a leg, so that's...


649
0:46:20,786 --> 0:46:24,226
The bamboo has got through skin, it's got through ligament as well.


650
0:46:24,226 --> 0:46:26,867
So it's doing pretty well, I'd say.


651
0:46:26,867 --> 0:46:27,947
How about that?

Well, I don't think I'm going to be too adventurous.


654
0:46:32,547 --> 0:46:35,146
Shall I try the arrow head you just made?


655
0:46:35,146 --> 0:46:38,507
Go for it. You don't mind if I step 20 metres aside?

Yeah, you keep well to one side, Joe.

I wouldn't trust me with this at all.

Well, how about we try the cabbage?

664

666
0:47:7,626 --> 0:47:11,867
Arrow in a cabbage. Look.


667
0:47:11,867 --> 0:47:15,947
Well, that's pretty impressive for bamboo technology, I think.


668
0:47:15,947 --> 0:47:17,106
Well, now that you've killed the cabbage,


669
0:47:17,106 --> 0:47:19,27
we can have that for dinner as well, with the chicken.


670
0:47:19,27 --> 0:47:22,306
Excellent.


671
0:47:22,306 --> 0:47:26,27
ROBERTS: Bamboo turns out to be surprisingly versatile,


672
0:47:26,27 --> 0:47:30,146
so it's at least possible that modern humans from Africa were here


673
0:47:30,146 --> 0:47:37,266
using sophisticated tools, made not of stone but of bamboo.


674
0:47:37,266 --> 0:47:40,987
But that still doesn't prove that the Chinese came out of Africa


675
0:47:40,987 --> 0:47:45,706
with everybody else.


676
0:47:45,706 --> 0:47:48,867
However, there is something that could settle this debate


677
0:47:48,867 --> 0:47:53,387
of where the Chinese come from once and for all.


678
0:47:53,387 --> 0:47:54,547
After that...


679
0:47:54,547 --> 0:47:59,226
ROBERTS: I'm meeting Professor Jin Li, one of China's leading geneticists.


680
0:47:59,226 --> 0:48:3,387
Recently he led a project that set out to prove that the Chinese evolved


681
0:48:3,387 --> 0:48:5,867
independently from everyone else,


682
0:48:5,867 --> 0:48:11,186
from Homo erectus, here in China.


683
0:48:11,186 --> 0:48:15,27
Before the project started, I was hoping that I could identify


684
0:48:15,27 --> 0:48:17,226
or could be able to find the evidence


685
0:48:17,226 --> 0:48:21,626
that support independent origin of Chinese in China.


686
0:48:21,626 --> 0:48:25,186
Because I'm a Chinese, I came from China,


687
0:48:25,186 --> 0:48:27,186
and through the education process


688
0:48:27,186 --> 0:48:34,827
I always believed that there is something special about Chinese.


689
0:48:34,827 --> 0:48:37,507
ROBERTS: He's singled out a male genetic marker,


690
0:48:37,507 --> 0:48:41,266
which only appeared about 80,000 years ago in Africa.


691
0:48:41,266 --> 0:48:46,347
So any man who carries that marker must have recent African ancestors


692
0:48:46,347 --> 0:48:52,507
and can't be descended from the more ancient Asian Homo erectus.


693
0:48:52,507 --> 0:48:58,547
Jin took DNA from over 1 60 ethnic groups around East Asia.


694
0:48:58,547 --> 0:49:7,987
over 1 2,000 samples.


695
0:49:7,987 --> 0:49:9,746
And so, what did you find?


696
0:49:9,746 --> 0:49:14,867
We did not see any... even one single individual


697
0:49:14,867 --> 0:49:18,987
that could be considered as the descendant


698
0:49:18,987 --> 0:49:21,266
of the Homo erectus in China.


699
0:49:21,266 --> 0:49:27,947
Rather, everybody was a descendant of our ancestors from Africa.


700
0:49:27,947 --> 0:49:30,827
ROBERTS: The result couldn't have been any clearer.


701
0:49:30,827 --> 0:49:34,827
ROBERTS: How does that make you feel, as a Chinese person?


702
0:49:34,827 --> 0:49:40,586
After I saw the evidences that we generate in my laboratory,


703
0:49:40,586 --> 0:49:44,746
I think we should all be happy with that, because after all,


704
0:49:44,746 --> 0:49:47,387
modern humans from different part of the world


705
0:49:47,387 --> 0:49:51,387
are not so different from each other and we are very close relatives.


706
0:49:51,387 --> 0:49:55,266
ROBERTS: That's great. Thank you.


707
0:49:55,266 --> 0:49:59,186
ROBERTS: So Africa is the home of the Chinese.


708
0:49:59,186 --> 0:50:3,427
Jin Li's research confirms that their ancestors, too,


709
0:50:3,427 --> 0:50:7,186
were part of that tiny group that left the continent


710
0:50:7,186 --> 0:50:10,786
around 70,000 years ago.


711
0:50:10,786 --> 0:50:13,706
And genetics is also helping us understand


712
0:50:13,706 --> 0:50:16,266
how people spread through Asia.


713
0:50:16,266 --> 0:50:19,907
our ancestors reached Siberia very early on.


714
0:50:19,907 --> 0:50:23,106
But there was another even earlier migration route,


715
0:50:23,106 --> 0:50:25,867
spreading along the coast of southern Asia


716
0:50:25,867 --> 0:50:33,867
and eventually reaching China.


717
0:50:33,867 --> 0:50:38,67
one day, as we push forward the frontiers of genetic research,


718
0:50:38,67 --> 0:50:42,746
we may even discover the origin of those Chinese features.


719
0:50:42,746 --> 0:50:46,106
So, if they weren't a result of adaptation to cold,


720
0:50:46,106 --> 0:50:48,387
where might they have come from?


721
0:50:48,387 --> 0:50:53,507
It could simply be chance, or it could be down to sex.


722
0:50:53,507 --> 0:50:57,27
If particular features are considered attractive in a population,


723
0:50:57,27 --> 0:50:58,827
then people with those features


724
0:50:58,827 --> 0:51:2,827
are much more likely to pass their genes on to the next generation.


725
0:51:2,827 --> 0:51:5,547
And if that group then goes on to flourish,


726
0:51:5,547 --> 0:51:12,467
those features could become very widespread.


727
0:51:12,467 --> 0:51:14,746
ROBERTS: And the handful of people with these features


728
0:51:14,746 --> 0:51:17,666
certainly did flourish.


729
0:51:17,666 --> 0:51:23,27
Their descendants filled the vast spaces of Asia.


730
0:51:23,27 --> 0:51:26,666
And eventually they would move on from hunting and gathering


731
0:51:26,666 --> 0:51:36,186
to build one of the greatest civilizations of the world.


732
0:51:36,186 --> 0:51:41,186
In this city, the hub of the world's second-largest economy,


733
0:51:41,186 --> 0:51:43,67
it feels like I'm on a different planet


734
0:51:43,67 --> 0:51:45,987
to the one inhabited by those hunter-gatherers.


735
0:51:45,987 --> 0:51:49,547
But is it possible to look back into prehistory


736
0:51:49,547 --> 0:52:4,626
and find those early steps, the seeds of civilisation in China?


737
0:52:4,626 --> 0:52:12,746
ROBERTS: What was it that turned hunter-gatherers into empire builders?


738
0:52:12,746 --> 0:52:18,67
I'm travelling through the awe-inspiring landscape of Guilin, in South China,


739
0:52:18,67 --> 0:52:39,507
in search of the key to their success.


740
0:52:39,507 --> 0:52:42,186
This is the Tsung Pien cave.


741
0:52:42,186 --> 0:52:48,626
Excavations here tell us it was once lived in by hunter-gatherers.


742
0:52:48,626 --> 0:53:1,67
And in 2001, a wonderful discovery was made.


743
0:53:1,67 --> 0:53:6,547
These fragments are so precious that I'm not even allowed to touch them.


744
0:53:6,547 --> 0:53:10,947
They are what remains of one of the oldest pots in China.


745
0:53:10,947 --> 0:53:25,27
In fact, one of the oldest pots in the world.


746
0:53:25,27 --> 0:53:26,746
So, who made this pot?


747
0:53:26,746 --> 0:53:31,106
Well, the people living in this cave so many thousands of years ago


748
0:53:31,106 --> 0:53:33,507
would have been nomadic hunter-gatherers,


749
0:53:33,507 --> 0:53:37,146
still living an ancient lifestyle in many ways.


750
0:53:37,146 --> 0:53:41,106
But those insignificant-looking crude pieces of pot


751
0:53:41,106 --> 0:53:46,306
mark a great technological leap forward.


752
0:53:46,306 --> 0:53:49,467
ROBERTS: So prehistoric pottery's has also been found in this cave?


753
0:53:49,467 --> 0:53:52,266
ROBERTS: Pots are something we take for granted.


754
0:53:52,266 --> 0:53:54,666
But for those ancient hunter-gatherers,


755
0:53:54,666 --> 0:54:1,347
pottery was a part of a completely new way of life.


756
0:54:1,347 --> 0:54:7,706
So how did they do it?


757
0:54:7,706 --> 0:54:10,706
I'm meeting a team of experimental archaeologists,


758
0:54:10,706 --> 0:54:13,827
who think they might have the answer.


759
0:54:13,827 --> 0:54:15,706
The first breakthrough must have been


760
0:54:15,706 --> 0:54:18,907
finding out how to stop the pots cracking when they were fired,


761
0:54:18,907 --> 0:54:23,146
tempering them by mixing calcite rock with the clay.


762
0:54:23,146 --> 0:54:26,427
And they even have an idea how the pots might have been shaped,


763
0:54:26,427 --> 0:54:31,226
thousands of years before the invention of the potter's wheel.


764
0:54:31,226 --> 0:54:33,306
This is very clever. They've dug a pit here


765
0:54:33,306 --> 0:54:36,706
to basically give us the form of the pot, almost like a mould.


766
0:54:36,706 --> 0:54:40,146
And then we're pressing this clay in little slabs down into the...


767
0:54:40,146 --> 0:54:41,387
(SPEAKING IN MANDARIN)


768
0:54:41,387 --> 0:54:42,746
ROBERTS: ...pre-formed pit.


769
0:54:42,746 --> 0:54:44,106
(SPEAKING IN MANDARIN)


770
0:54:44,106 --> 0:54:46,746
ROBERTS: Transforming clay into hard pottery


771
0:54:46,746 --> 0:54:49,427
requires firing at a high temperature.


772
0:54:49,427 --> 0:54:53,226
Today, this is done at 1,000 degrees Celsius in a kiln -


773
0:54:53,226 --> 0:55:2,586
way beyond the capabilities of those hunter-gatherers.


774
0:55:2,586 --> 0:55:4,626
They would've had open fires,


775
0:55:4,626 --> 0:55:8,746
which only produce temperatures of about 250 degrees.


776
0:55:8,746 --> 0:55:16,547
I'm quite doubtful this is going to be enough.


777
0:55:16,547 --> 0:55:18,907
So how's our pot?


778
0:55:18,907 --> 0:55:21,306
(ExCLAIMS) I think that's it.


779
0:55:21,306 --> 0:55:24,507
I think that's our pot there, and it looks okay!


780
0:55:24,507 --> 0:55:31,467
(SPEAKING IN MANDARIN)


781
0:55:31,467 --> 0:55:36,106
ROBERTS: Fantastic.


782
0:55:36,106 --> 0:55:37,867
There are many different theories about


783
0:55:37,867 --> 0:55:40,786
why the Chinese hunter-gatherers might have started making pots.


784
0:55:40,786 --> 0:55:43,706
Some people say it was a symbol of prestige.


785
0:55:43,706 --> 0:55:45,706
But the Chinese archaeologists think


786
0:55:45,706 --> 0:55:51,266
that the explanation is much more simple - cooking.


787
0:55:51,266 --> 0:55:56,67
ROBERTS: Pots meant that a wider range of food could be cooked and stored,


788
0:55:56,67 --> 0:55:59,67
vital in hard times.


789
0:55:59,67 --> 0:56:3,306
And by 9,000 years ago, there was another innovation -


790
0:56:3,306 --> 0:56:5,467
farming.


791
0:56:5,467 --> 0:56:9,706
One of the things that those early Chinese potters would have been eating


792
0:56:9,706 --> 0:56:11,347
was wild rice.


793
0:56:11,347 --> 0:56:13,626
Now, it certainly wouldn't have been the main source of food,


794
0:56:13,626 --> 0:56:15,467
because it was hard to collect


795
0:56:15,467 --> 0:56:18,67
and actually didn't give much energy in return.


796
0:56:18,67 --> 0:56:21,27
But despite the availability of other vegetables,


797
0:56:21,27 --> 0:56:24,547
it was rice that became more and more important


798
0:56:24,547 --> 0:56:29,67
and even crucial to the early success of the Chinese.


799
0:56:29,67 --> 0:56:30,666
ROBERTS: This looks good, doesn't it?


800
0:56:30,666 --> 0:56:33,987
ROBERTS: But wild rice doesn't produce much grain.


801
0:56:33,987 --> 0:56:37,746
So how was such an unpromising plant changed into the food


802
0:56:37,746 --> 0:56:45,467
that would feed a continent?


803
0:56:45,467 --> 0:56:49,67
Well, one of those early farmers must have stumbled


804
0:56:49,67 --> 0:56:57,507
on a way of tricking nature.


805
0:56:57,507 --> 0:56:59,347
Rice needs plenty of water,


806
0:56:59,347 --> 0:57:1,987
so I'm helping the farmers irrigate their paddy field,


807
0:57:1,987 --> 0:57:5,186
creating the type of watery, marshy environment


808
0:57:5,186 --> 0:57:7,347
that rice naturally grows in.


809
0:57:7,347 --> 0:57:11,27
But when rice is deprived of water, it does something rather interesting.


810
0:57:11,27 --> 0:57:13,706
It starts to produce masses of seeds.


811
0:57:13,706 --> 0:57:15,266
So what the early farmers hit on


812
0:57:15,266 --> 0:57:18,947
was a cunning plan to get rice to do just that,


813
0:57:18,947 --> 0:57:27,266
by creating an artificial drought.


814
0:57:27,266 --> 0:57:31,666
ROBERTS: Someone came up with the idea of filling paddy fields up with water


815
0:57:31,666 --> 0:57:34,186
and then allowing it to evaporate.


816
0:57:34,186 --> 0:57:38,467
It's as though the rice plants expect a drought and panic,


817
0:57:38,467 --> 0:57:40,867
producing many more seeds.


818
0:57:40,867 --> 0:57:44,226
Grains of rice.


819
0:57:44,226 --> 0:57:46,547
Probably one of the things which made rice so appealing


820
0:57:46,547 --> 0:57:48,867
to hunter-gatherers and made them want to grow it


821
0:57:48,867 --> 0:57:53,626
was that you could store the seeds for food during the winter.


822
0:57:53,626 --> 0:57:56,427
ROBERTS: once there was more food and it could be relied on,


823
0:57:56,427 --> 0:57:58,306
populations boomed.


824
0:57:58,306 --> 0:57:59,827
Families settled down.


825
0:57:59,827 --> 0:58:6,347
They started to build villages, towns, and eventually cities.


826
0:58:6,347 --> 0:58:10,467
These humble plants represent the end of the journey


827
0:58:10,467 --> 0:58:12,186
for Chinese hunter-gatherers,


828
0:58:12,186 --> 0:58:14,947
and the beginnings of something new,


829
0:58:14,947 --> 0:58:17,947
farming and civilisation.


830
0:58:17,947 --> 0:58:20,706
It's no exaggeration to say that this development


831
0:58:20,706 --> 0:58:23,947
was the foundation of the most successful


832
0:58:23,947 --> 0:58:26,306
group of humans living today.


833
0:58:26,306 --> 0:60:26,306
And the rest is history.
