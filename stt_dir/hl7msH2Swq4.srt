0:0:7,45 --> 0:0:11,73
PRESIDENT OBAMA: By 2025, we
expect new spacecraft designed


3
0:0:11,73 --> 0:0:14,47
for long journeys to allow us to
begin the first ever crewed


4
0:0:14,47 --> 0:0:18,9
missions beyond the Moon
into deep space.


5
0:0:18,9 --> 0:0:21,5
We'll start by sending
astronauts to an asteroid for


6
0:0:21,5 --> 0:0:24,19
the first time in history.


7
0:0:24,19 --> 0:0:35,52



8
0:0:35,52 --> 0:0:37,56
NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: There's
an asteroid called Apophis


9
0:0:37,56 --> 0:0:39,17
discovered a couple
of years ago.


10
0:0:39,17 --> 0:0:43,21
That asteroid, on Friday the
13th in April in the year


11
0:0:43,21 --> 0:0:48,15
2029, will come close enough
to Earth to dip below our


12
0:0:48,15 --> 0:0:49,755
orbiting communications
satellites.


13
0:0:49,755 --> 0:0:51,52
It'll be the biggest,
closest thing


14
0:0:51,52 --> 0:0:53,97
ever in recorded history.


15
0:0:53,97 --> 0:0:56,78
If it goes through what we call
the keyhole, which is


16
0:0:56,78 --> 0:1:0,51
where the Earth's gravity is
just right, it will hit the


17
0:1:0,51 --> 0:1:1,76
Earth seven years later.


18
0:1:1,76 --> 0:1:4,209



19
0:1:4,209 --> 0:1:6,5
If it goes through the center
of the keyhole, it will hit


20
0:1:6,5 --> 0:1:9,66
the Pacific Ocean and create
waves of tsunamis that'll


21
0:1:9,66 --> 0:1:12,93
blast clean the entire west
coast of North America.


22
0:1:12,93 --> 0:1:15,48



23
0:1:15,48 --> 0:1:17,8
MIKE GERNHARDT: It is a
statistical certainty that one


24
0:1:17,8 --> 0:1:21,54
day, the Earth will get hit by a
large asteroid, whether that


25
0:1:21,54 --> 0:1:26,168
be in 50 years or 100
million years.


26
0:1:26,168 --> 0:1:29,56



27
0:1:29,56 --> 0:1:31,17
NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: We pay
for insurance against car


28
0:1:31,17 --> 0:1:34,46
accidents, against damage to
your home, but no one has


29
0:1:34,46 --> 0:1:38,9
organized what it would take
to get asteroid insurance.


30
0:1:38,9 --> 0:1:39,71
In fact, the asteroid insurance
isn't to replace


31
0:1:39,71 --> 0:1:42,34
your home if you get hit by an
asteroid, it would be to have


32
0:1:42,34 --> 0:1:46,508
enough money to do something
about it in the first place.


33
0:1:46,508 --> 0:1:53,69



34
0:1:53,69 --> 0:1:54,85
SAUL ROSSER: My name's
Saul Rosser.


35
0:1:54,85 --> 0:1:57,64
I'm the Operations Director at
Aquarius Reef Base, which is


36
0:1:57,64 --> 0:2:0,76
NOAA's underwater habitat or
research station about four


37
0:2:0,76 --> 0:2:2,48
miles off of Key Largo.


38
0:2:2,48 --> 0:2:5,71
We house six people at a time
about 60 feet underwater.


39
0:2:5,71 --> 0:2:8,56
During this mission, we have
three astronauts, a planetary


40
0:2:8,56 --> 0:2:11,9
scientist, and two of our
technicians living underwater


41
0:2:11,9 --> 0:2:14,903
to work on techniques for
exploring asteroids.


42
0:2:14,903 --> 0:2:21,765



43
0:2:21,765 --> 0:2:25,52
The first habitat was built in
1962 by Jacques Cousteau.


44
0:2:25,52 --> 0:2:27,36
Now 50 years later,
this is the last


45
0:2:27,36 --> 0:2:29,26
habitat on the sea floor.


46
0:2:29,26 --> 0:2:31,5
And this is the only place you
can do this kind of thing.


47
0:2:31,5 --> 0:2:33,18
So they're down there looking
at, how do you translate


48
0:2:33,18 --> 0:2:35,9
across an asteroid, and how do
you work out the details of


49
0:2:35,9 --> 0:2:39,6
moving along in a zero-G
environment, taking samples,


50
0:2:39,6 --> 0:2:40,88
and working across the surface
of the asteroid?


51
0:2:40,88 --> 0:2:43,51



52
0:2:43,51 --> 0:2:46,1
BILL TODD: NEEMO is NASA's
undersea research program--


53
0:2:46,1 --> 0:2:48,42
stands for NASA's Extreme
Environment Mission


54
0:2:48,42 --> 0:2:49,28
Operations.


55
0:2:49,28 --> 0:2:52,63
This particular mission is
focused on going to an


56
0:2:52,63 --> 0:2:55,785
asteroid and living and working
on the surface of an


57
0:2:55,785 --> 0:2:59,6
asteroid, which is a fairly
complex and difficult task.


58
0:2:59,6 --> 0:3:4,16
What possibly could be more cool
and more exciting than


59
0:3:4,16 --> 0:3:8,57
blending outer space and
undersea together in this is


60
0:3:8,57 --> 0:3:13,34
extremely vivid, dynamic,
exciting environment that


61
0:3:13,34 --> 0:3:15,912
there's also risk that you have
to manage, and you have


62
0:3:15,912 --> 0:3:17,42
to really pay attention
to what you're doing?


63
0:3:17,42 --> 0:3:18,67
For me, that's exciting.


64
0:3:18,67 --> 0:3:23,79



65
0:3:23,79 --> 0:3:24,785
MIKE GERNHARDT: So my name
is Mike Gernhardt.


66
0:3:24,785 --> 0:3:25,96
I'm a NASA astronaut.


67
0:3:25,96 --> 0:3:28,34
I've actually flown in space
four times, and I'm the


68
0:3:28,34 --> 0:3:30,92
principal investigator of
the Neemo 16 mission.


69
0:3:30,92 --> 0:3:33,78
So to be perfectly honest with
you, I had my heart set on


70
0:3:33,78 --> 0:3:36,5
going back to the Moon, and I
was hoping to maybe have a


71
0:3:36,5 --> 0:3:37,97
chance to be the crew
that did that.


72
0:3:37,97 --> 0:3:41,98
So when I first heard we're
going to an asteroid and


73
0:3:41,98 --> 0:3:44,83
stopping the lunar program,
that was a big


74
0:3:44,83 --> 0:3:46,31
disappointment to me.


75
0:3:46,31 --> 0:3:50,79
But rather than go off and cry
in the corner, I picked it up


76
0:3:50,79 --> 0:3:53,62
with my team, and we started
working the details of what


77
0:3:53,62 --> 0:3:55,42
it's going to be like to
work on an asteroid.


78
0:3:55,42 --> 0:3:58,5
And it's turned out to be a very
fascinating, challenging


79
0:3:58,5 --> 0:4:0,6
place to work that's really
moved our technologies forward


80
0:4:0,6 --> 0:4:3,536
in a very positive way.


81
0:4:3,536 --> 0:4:7,16



82
0:4:7,16 --> 0:4:10,12
Working and doing space walks
on the asteroid is like the


83
0:4:10,12 --> 0:4:14,73
worst combination of the dirt
and all of that of the Moon


84
0:4:14,73 --> 0:4:17,1
but with no ground
reaction force.


85
0:4:17,1 --> 0:4:19,19
On the Moon, you can walk.


86
0:4:19,19 --> 0:4:20,72
You have ground reaction
force.


87
0:4:20,72 --> 0:4:23,24
On a space station, we're
floating around but we have


88
0:4:23,24 --> 0:4:26,48
pre-engineered translation paths
with handholds and foot


89
0:4:26,48 --> 0:4:28,61
restraints and all these
kinds of things.


90
0:4:28,61 --> 0:4:30,46
And we have none of that
on an asteroid.


91
0:4:30,46 --> 0:4:33,45
So two and a half years ago,
no one had any idea of how


92
0:4:33,45 --> 0:4:35,8
we're going to do
these things.


93
0:4:35,8 --> 0:4:37,26
And we have very systematically
developed the


94
0:4:37,26 --> 0:4:41,6
techniques and evaluated them,
and I think that we're well on


95
0:4:41,6 --> 0:4:42,8
our way to understanding
what those


96
0:4:42,8 --> 0:4:46,1
operations should be like.


97
0:4:46,1 --> 0:4:49,37



98
0:4:49,37 --> 0:4:52,54
So we probably won't land on an
asteroid, but we will touch


99
0:4:52,54 --> 0:4:53,97
the asteroid with
a human hand.


100
0:4:53,97 --> 0:4:57,5
And the way we will do that is
to be on a foot restraint


101
0:4:57,5 --> 0:5:0,11
that's attached to the space
exploration vehicle, this


102
0:5:0,11 --> 0:5:2,24
small vehicle that
flies around.


103
0:5:2,24 --> 0:5:5,65
So we'll fly in close to the
asteroid and then reach in


104
0:5:5,65 --> 0:5:9,25
with our foot on a foot
restraint and grab rocks or


105
0:5:9,25 --> 0:5:12,2
deploy scientific instruments
on the asteroid.


106
0:5:12,2 --> 0:5:16,4
So unlike the lunar landing, we
will probably not land and


107
0:5:16,4 --> 0:5:17,58
attach to the asteroid.


108
0:5:17,58 --> 0:5:21,55
We will fly around it and touch
it with our hands to get


109
0:5:21,55 --> 0:5:25,717
the samples that we need to
understand the geology.


110
0:5:25,717 --> 0:5:30,37



111
0:5:30,37 --> 0:5:33,31
There are all sorts of minerals
on these asteroids


112
0:5:33,31 --> 0:5:34,55
that we can't get
here on Earth.


113
0:5:34,55 --> 0:5:35,81
There's rare earth metals.


114
0:5:35,81 --> 0:5:36,91
There's platinum.


115
0:5:36,91 --> 0:5:40,75
There's precious metals,
things like that.


116
0:5:40,75 --> 0:5:44,78
Without a doubt, there are
economic benefits of mining,


117
0:5:44,78 --> 0:5:46,52
and I think it will come.


118
0:5:46,52 --> 0:5:48,78
It's not 10 years away.


119
0:5:48,78 --> 0:5:51,79
I think it's way more
than that, but


120
0:5:51,79 --> 0:5:53,4
you gotta start somewhere.


121
0:5:53,4 --> 0:5:57,25



122
0:5:57,25 --> 0:5:59,24
By going to an asteroid and
understanding their


123
0:5:59,24 --> 0:6:4,23
characteristics, that informs us
with better techniques for


124
0:6:4,23 --> 0:6:7,57
so-called planetary defense,
where we could either slightly


125
0:6:7,57 --> 0:6:10,28
shift the course of the asteroid
at a distance far


126
0:6:10,28 --> 0:6:13,55
enough away that it doesn't
hit the earth or possibly


127
0:6:13,55 --> 0:6:15,98
percuss it into smaller
pieces.


128
0:6:15,98 --> 0:6:18,77
We don't really know the right
answer for that, but the more


129
0:6:18,77 --> 0:6:22,92
we know about asteroids, the
better informed we'll be to


130
0:6:22,92 --> 0:6:25,67
defend the Earth against an
asteroid hit in the future.


131
0:6:25,67 --> 0:6:26,86
NEIL DEGRASSE TYSON: Well, we're
smart enough, and we


132
0:6:26,86 --> 0:6:29,74
have a space program, and we're
clever enough that we


133
0:6:29,74 --> 0:6:32,24
never have to go extinct
by an asteroid.


134
0:6:32,24 --> 0:6:34,4
We have more choices available
to us than


135
0:6:34,4 --> 0:6:38,316
Tyrannosaurus Rex did.


136
0:6:38,316 --> 0:8:38,316
