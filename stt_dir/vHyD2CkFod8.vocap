###23 STANLEY: Hello. I'm Benjamen T. Stanley. I am a local chef from Chicago. My day job--I'm
###28 a research development chef for a small flavoring company called Bell Flavors and Fragrances.
###29 It's based on the Northbrook. But when I come home at night, I like to experiment. I like
###32 to do a lot of fun things. I like to kind of teach myself a lot of different things.
###42 So I'm basically going to do a run down on fermentation and my personal experiences with
###56 it, working with a--kind of learning how to do things myself and think different fermented
###58 products. And fermented food is just--it's one of those products that a lot of people
###60 don't really understand the process for, but they loved them. Over, I think it's 1/3 of
###66 the food consumers is fermented like anything from soy sauce, tea, chocolate, coffee, sauerkraut,
###71 kimchi, any kind of cheese. We consume over 15 million tons of cheese annually as a culture.
###79 Over 22 million gallons of beer and other fermented liquors like, you know, wine, any
###87 kind of bacchus, stuff like that. And the basic understanding of why these things happen
###94 is generally unknown to the public. By definition, fermentation is an anaerobic process. So basically,
###103 it's the conversion of sugar or some kind of carbohydrate plus some kind of bacteria
###114 and it converts it into alcohol or combine with energy along with other enzymes, other,
###123 you know, various chemicals. In a food sense, it doesn't have to be anaerobic. It can also
###130 be aerobic. So large processing situations, we'll add air, we'll add different temperatures,
###136 we'll kind of control the conditions of the way things ferment help, kind of facilitate
###144 that fermentation to help the growth of organisms, to help them thrive, to help them feed. So
###151 this is the chemical reaction. It looks pretty difficult. It looks kind of weird. Basically,
###157 sugar--any kind of sugar, glucose, fructose, sucrose. You add it to your microbial agent
###163 like yeasts, molds, other kind of bacteria and they release alcohol, just basic ethanol,
###170 carbon dioxide and some kind of energy unit whether it be heat, whether at the--some kind
###176 of different bi-product, CO2 and stuff like that. Why this is an important process? Fermentation
###186 is probably one of the oldest methods of preservation. There's quite a few different methods that
###188 are tried and true. First one is salting. What salt does is it basically draws moisture
###198 out of your products and also inhibits microbial growth. So it helps inhibit, you know, different
###204 organisms from growing and stuff like that. But it's usually the fungicidal, spores, stuff
###212 like that, that it helps to prevent. So what you're doing is the salt will pull the moisture
###216 out. It'll pull out the water which is, you know, breeding ground for a lot of different
###218 organisms, stuff like that. And then it will create this boundary between the products
###227 and the air. So the different organisms can't penetrate to that salt solution. Another one
###239 is smoking--same idea. The smoke is antimicrobial. You're basically enveloping a product in smoke,
###243 you're creating this kind of crust that goes over your product and it's helping keep the
###248 air in getting into your product, it's helping keep those organisms from fermenting the product.
###255 And then the other one is drying or dehydrating. Again, you're pulling the moisture out and
###261 moisture is what helps facilitate this growth. Fermentation is involved in a lot of other
###270 processes, kind of like ethanol preservation where the use of alcohol is used to inhibit
###275 growth. The high levels of alcohol would kill organisms, as well as lactic acid preservation
###280 which is what you see in cheese, the high acid levels, the same with vinegar, pickling.
###287 The high acid levels will only permit certain organisms to grow but not others. Fermenting
###296 a product--there's two different kinds of techniques we used to get the process going
###302 to get it kind of started, facilitated, inoculated, you might say. The first one is wild fermentation
###309 which basically just leaving a product out, exposing it to air, exposing it to anything
###313 that's flying around the room. A lot of yeasts are present in everyday flowers, on the outside
###320 are fruits and vegetables, an outer peel. Anything that's really high in sugar, it will
###326 attract some kind of organism to come and feed on. The other way is to have human input.
###336 Basically, human input provides a more controlled environment that we can change and affect
###340 the final outcome of our product. So, what they'll do is they'll actually develop a certain
###346 product, let's say, yogurt. You know, they have this yogurt that they tried it through.
###352 They like the way it taste. What they can do is take their original base, [INDISTINCT]
###356 heat it to kill all the organisms that are in there and then re-introduced that the yogurt
###362 had passed the flavor and the consistency that they want to that heated base that basically
###368 starts out with a clean pallet and only incorporates the organisms that they wanted. And they do
###373 the same method for making the yogurt that will come out, for the most part, the exact
###377 same way as the original one as they do follow the same process. Wild fermentation is a little
###387 bit more unreliable. There's a lot of different things in the area that contribute to it,
###391 but that also will develop the most interesting flavors. Stuff like sourdough breads. You
###396 can make a sourdough bread in San Francisco and it'll taste completely different than
###399 the sourdough bread in Chicago because of the temperature or the environment, different
###405 yeast that are on the air, stuff like that. Other factors in the end-product, we have
###425 temperature, environment, season, humidity, your experimentation basically. What your
###433 type of processes and the flow at how things get done. Ms. Jo over here just kind of builds
###442 closer a little bit, to each one in wine making clarification. If you take out some of the
###455 salads in your product, it will affect the final fermentation of the product and then
###467 you'll have less [INDISTINCT], less yeast because the yeast kind of stay on the sides
###486 on the grapes till you pull the skins out, you're actually pulling out some of the actual
###501 organisms that are doing the fermentation. Temperature shock, whether that organism has
###511 the right temperature to grow, usually about bio-temperature, the perfect temperature for
###520 the organisms to dry. If you make it go really cold, they won't kill them, but they'll kind
###533 of go asleep. They kind of won't do anything or get lazy. They won't actually ferment anything.
###547 You raise it up too high, you'll kill them and then they can't do anything. Other minerals,
###562 other things that can help facilitate the growth whether the oxygen, different minerals,
###574 different kinds of salt, some kind of phosphate or nitrate, and as well as, you know, the
###590 microbiological environment whether they're yeasts and molds and everything are in the
###598 surrounding area whether what you're trying to inoculate with is able to compete with
###609 what's already in the air. Traces and history, I guess that is one of the oldest processes
###627 where preserving foods and it starts almost as old as 12 to 20--12,000 years ago. Mead
###644 was one of the first products that originated and it's basically just a fermented honey
###652 drink. Honey collecting as early as 12,000 years ago, in areas like Egypt and Samarian
###659 areas and for most part, a lot of these things were discovered by accident. Honey, for example,
###666 is high in sugar so, you know, it is an attractant for these yeasts and molds and other things.
###676 They will collect the honey. They mix it with water and make a drink and they didn't have
###684 refrigeration so they just let it sit out. While as it sit out, they started to notice,
###695 you know, little things, changes going on to it, they started to notice bubbles come
###709 out, they started to see discoloration, different things growing out. And this visual queue
###722 is originally how fermentation happened. Just seeing a bout of change and tasting it as
###738 it changed, to kind of, you know, see the differences and see whether they liked it
###748 or not. Soy sauce dates back to over 2,500 years ago. Until the 17th century, with the
###757 creation of the microscope, it was generally unknown why these things happened. People
###768 just started doing it in their homes, in their basements and they found that it tasted good
###780 and they just went off with that and started making chesses and started making alcohols.
###788 They don't really understand why. And when the microscope was created, they started to
###798 notice these little organisms, different things inside of the foods. Well, it's science and
###804 at the time, it was such a new concept that it was generally disregarded. A lot of scientists
###818 kind of refused the fact that this could even happen, that there were some kind of small
###825 living organisms and the things that they're eating and they just--they didn't even believe
###836 it and they completely rejected it outright. It wasn't even until about the 19th to 20th
###851 century when Louis Pasteur actually decided to make this connection between what was growing
###863 and the changes that were done. The way that he came upon this process was that a company
###879 that was a making a beet juice alcohol was having a lot of variations in his product.
###894 And he didn't understand why. He'd been making it the same way for a number of years and
###913 it was just coming out different every single time he was making it, it was very unreliable,
###928 it was affecting his business. So he gave it to the chemist, Louis Pasteur to test stuff.
###949 Well, upon looking at the microscope, he noticed that from older samples of the alcohol versus
###963 newer ones, there were different things, different organisms, different small bacteria that were
###971 present. So he actually came up with a method of pasteurization which we all know is just
###990 heating a product to kill that microflora and then you reintroduced it with the specific
###998 starter that you wanted. Some benefits of fermentation; preservation, it preserves not
###1012 only the product itself but it also preserves nutrients. It will actually increase the way
###1020 that the body--the body can kind of use some of the nutrients especially like vitamin B,
###1034 vitamin C, calcium. It prevents them from being destroyed by sitting in for a long period
###1047 of time. It kind of prevents the degradation of the product itself. The digestive aide,
###1064 a lot of the products if they are not heated, they still have these live cultures and it
###1076 still has its microflora and because this microflora can survive very acidic environments,
###1092 it still is highly active in your intestinal tract, in your body system. So as you go through
###1110 your system and often kind of make a small home in your intestinal tract, it will actually
###1136 help you digest foods, it will help you absorb nutrients better, it will help you absorb
###1152 different nutrients that your body normally can't breakdown, a lot of proteins, a lot
###1164 of amino acids that your body has a really hard time breaking down. The organisms will
###1177 do the work for you. Flavor development, there's a specific chemical reaction that happens
###1184 when, you know, you're doing this fermentation and you're developing a lot of different flavors
###1201 through the use of enzymes, through the use of creating acids and alcohols. It has antioxidant
###1212 properties that actually opens up that antioxidants that your body can use them a little bit better.
###1222 It's a fortifier. Like I said, it creates vitamin B. It removes toxins. The process
###1235 of fermentation is used for ingredients like coffee. When coffee is grown, it has a cherry
###1246 on the outside of it, you pick the cherry and let it sit out so that fruit can ripen,
###1255 kind of fall off and then you take the beans from it. And that helps removes some of the
###1271 toxins that are associated with the cherry. Same is true with like certain types of cassava.
###1287 In Africa, they have to take cassava and soak it in water to help pull that cyanide that
###1307 is present in the vegetable out. Once they're soaked in the water, these toxins come out
###1317 and they can actually cook the cassava and eat it. Again, you know, there's a processing
###1333 aide, tea is another example, when they pull the leaves, they let them sit out to dry and
###1351 ferment. This allows the tea to develop more flavor, to have less moisture in it, lasts
###1369 longer. And now I'm going to go over some specific examples. Vegetable ferments. They're
###1381 basically usually using a salt brine to help protect the vegetables from rotting. The salt
###1392 will pull the moisture out of the vegetable and actually create its own shell for the
###1400 vegetable. Multiple changes occur in one thing. I use the example of sauerkraut. When you
###1419 first start sauerkraut, you add salt to your cabbage, the salt will pull the moisture out,
###1438 it will create this barrier for your sauerkraut and then it will only allow certain organisms
###1456 to grow. You're using just straight water and salt, only the coliform can grow and once
###1456 the coliform grows, it proliferates, it feeds, it will start taking the carbohydrates from
###1466 the cabbage, you know, it will output a certain level of acid. Once the acid starts to get
###1478 too high, it actually diminishes, you know, the coliform that's in the system and then
###1489 it will leave the kind of stuff will come in and started feeding on that acid. Again,
###1491 it goes up, it proliferates, and it starts to die down and then finally, lactobacillus
###1499 which is one of the most common, comes in and it will start to create lactic acid which
###1517 is that sharp--kind of cheesy sensation that you get from a lot of products like cheese,
###1538 sauerkraut, kimchi. This is a basic, a very traditional prop for making sauerkraut. Basically,
###1556 what you do is you take your salted cabbage which can be--sauerkraut can be anything.
###1561 Any kind of vegetable can be made into sauerkraut. You take your vegetable and you mix it with
###1569 salt, spices, you know, you use onions, apples, bay leaves, peppercorns, stuff like that.
###1577 You mixed it with the salt and now what you're going to do is you're going to take a very,
###1587 very heavy weight, push it on top of those vegetables. What the weight does is it helps
###1601 to push the moisture out of the vegetables and leave it at the bottom. If you want this
###1619 to be an anaerobic environment so that air doesn't affect how you think to mix as you
###1628 want the molds, you want the actual sauerkraut to develop anaerobic environment. So once
###1632 you weigh it, all you got to do is put a little bit of salt water around the room of the kraut.
###1643 And what the salt water does is, again, helps keep the microbes into entering into your
###1658 kraut and [INDISTINCT]. And you let it sit for anywhere from one week to up to a year
###1677 when that sit, unrefrigerated, you want to leave it at the ideal temperature for growth
###1690 which is anywhere between 85 and 100 degrees. It's kind of dark, you can't really see it,
###1712 but this is an example of sauerkraut that I made today that you guys are going to be
###1730 trying. It's basically just white cabbage, it's got some onions and apples, some different
###1741 spices and stuff like that. And this is–-I put in the bowl added salt to it, you generally
###1753 add about 5% to 10% solution of salt to your sauerkraut. And the salt will determine how
###1760 long it sits for. If you get more salt, then you will take your sauerkraut and age it for
###1777 a longer amount of time at a lower temperature. If you get less salt, then you're going to
###1790 age it for a shorter amount of time at a higher temperature. Kimchi, it's one of the most
###1796 popular condiments of Korea. It said that, every Korean on an individual basis consumes
###1811 about a quarter pound of kimchi a day which really adds up by the end of the year. It's
###1818 a very, very artisanal product. It's made by almost every family, for the family. It's
###1820 not really something that you go out and buy as often, that is traditionally nowadays with
###1825 conveniences and stuff like that, you can get it mass produced. But, usually it was
###1826 something that was a very home orientated part of the culture. They come home, they
###1832 harvest their own vegetables, they make the kimchi out of whatever vegetables they had
###1834 available. They mixed it with salt and spices and generally, chili pepper is used, they
###1840 use seafood, they use anything. The big difference between kimchi and sauerkraut is that when
###1841 you make kimchi, you soaked your vegetables ahead of time in salt water. What this does
###1842 is it pulls the moisture out, fuse the salt into the vegetables and it also kind of helps
###1844 keep the crisp texture of that kimchi. So this is soaking some cabbage to make it for
###1844 the kimchi. Again, this is about a 5% salt solution. Once you're done soaking it, you
###1845 pull out, chopped it, mix it with various vegetables. I use radish, carrot, a couple
###1846 of different kinds of greens, you generally used ginger, garlic, red pepper. Then you're
###1846 going to take it and put it in--I use--this is very similar to the sauerkraut prop. So
###1846 you can do it at home and just put it in any kind of container. Usually you want to use
###1850 a kind of hard plastic. You don't want to use metal because the metal will actually
###1853 react to the acids and kind of create a teeny taste your food. So any kind of plastic, any
###1856 kind of food crate--usually the big white buckets that you find as long as it's never
###1872 been used is a good option. Now what you're going to do is you're going to put a weight
###1874 on top to bring that moisture level to help protect your vegetables. This is an example
###1874 of a fruit kimchi. They are made the exact same style. Again, you take your fruit, cut
###1874 them off and salt them. If you can't soak them, brine them if you want, but it's not
###1874 necessary. And you got to take them--weigh them down. Bean ferments, a lot of people
###1875 are familiar with soy sauce and miso, tempeh [INDISTINCT] nattos which is a Japanese [INDISTINCT]
###1876 fermented with whole soy beans. Because of the protein content, they are very difficult
###1883 for the human body to digest. So we use the process of fermentation to help beak down
###1887 these proteins so that they're are easily digested by the body. This is kind of a simple
###1889 diagram of how soy sauce is made. Basically, you take your ingredients, the soybean, wheat,
###1896 and some kind of mold that's already been established from a different process. Usually,
###1899 the same molds that they use for making rice wine, sake is also as present in soy sauce.
###1904 What we'll do is put in an open air container and let proliferate, kind of grow and then
###1908 after they do that, take it, put it in a container, let it sit for a specific time temperature
###1914 for about six months. After it sits for a couple of months, they'll take it, they'll
###1920 press it to get all the liquid out, strain it, that's how you have soy sauce. That's
###1925 a nationally fermented soy sauce. They also have a method which is chemically induced
###1926 but much quicker. It usually takes about a couple of hours, but they'll take soy beans
###1926 and they'll add hydrochloric acid to it. This hydrolyses the vegetables and then it creates
###1928 that kind of meaty taste to it. You'll notice that taste is very chemically, it doesn't
###1935 taste sweet. There's a lot of flavors in that--kind of just don't exist when you have this chemically
###1939 made soy sauce. Tempeh is one of the more interesting products. Yes?
###1941 >> Do you have any idea about the Kikkoman fermented soy sauce, everybody has the stories
###1942 about Kikkoman? >> STANLEY: Kikkoman is actually one of the
###1943 few that are anturally fermented. >> Okay.
###1944 >> STANLEY: A lot of the--a lot of the stuff you buy in the store naturally brewed. A lot
###1946 of the stuff that's in more industrious scale, the stuff that you buy, you're processing
###1950 stuff like that, is not. >> Okay.
###1950 >> STANLEY: Tempeh is another [INDISTINCT] ferment which is basically cooked soy beans
###1950 that are allowed to cool. They have starter added to it and they sit in an open air environment.
###1952 What happens is that the starter will proliferate with the addition of air, warmth and it will
###1956 start to spread, you know, create this kind of mold. What the mold will do is it will
###1961 actually take all the soy beans and connect them. Mold will grow across the entire Tempeh
###1963 and actually pull it together to be this firm brick. And actually, it will develop very
###1965 earthy and kind of mushroom taste to it that are often desirable for vegetarian community
###1967 because it has that texture to it and it can absorb a lot of flavor, and it has that kind
###1972 of meaty texture to it. Dairy ferments, lactobacilli which is the common bacteria that are in dairy
###1975 ferments. They eat the lactose present in the dairy and they turn into lactic acid.
###1977 Lactose is basically an ingredient that's in most dairy that a lot of humans have a
###1977 hard time digesting because we do not have the enzyme that breaks down this lactose.
###1977 So, that's why if you're lactose intolerant, a lot of people that are lactose intolerant
###1977 will find that if they eat an aged cheese or if they eat a yogurt that's heavily fermented,
###1977 it doesn't bother them as much that's because the fermentation--the lactobacilli are actually
###1977 taking those enzymes that you can't process and do it for you. Some examples; buttermilk,
###1977 yogurt, butter, all sorts of cheeses, kefir which is another fermented yogurt product.
###1977 Yogurt, more so now than previously, starting to be promoted with having probiotics; as
###1977 having these organisms in it that are helping your digestive tract or helping you process
###1977 your food, they're helping you speed up your metabolism. This is not a new concept; this
###1977 has been around for thousands of years. It actually went away with the invention of pasteurization
###1977 because people were afraid of these things that were in their food, they're afraid that
###1977 they're going to make them sick. If you take yogurt and you just make it normally, you
###1977 actually have these probiotics, so they have these digestive enzymes. As you pasteurize
###1977 it, you're killing all those things; or, what that'll do is add the starters to it while
###1977 turning the yogurt, heat it after it's turned the yogurt to kill everything to make it safer
###1980 human consumption as you know, safe as in--meaning not exactly safer but more well received by
###1981 the public. When you're making yogurt, you only need to add a little bit of the starter
###1981 to get started. If you add too much or actually crowd everything, you know, it will cause
###1982 less of the bacteria to grow but more of the acid remains. You have a very, very sour astringent
###1982 yogurt. It's a relatively quick product to make; it only takes about eight to 12 hours
###1983 depending on how long you sit at the temperature where the bacteria proliferate at, it will
###1984 affect how sour the product is. So, generally what you do is you heat your yogurt up, this
###1984 is me heating the yogurt up. Heat up to about 180 degrees first, heat them out, sorry, start
###1984 out with the milk base. You can choose how much fat is in your milk base you're getting.
###1984 A thinner yogurt will have less fat, very thick yogurt will be high in fat; will go
###1984 up to 40% fat. Still have correct fermentation of yogurt. Add again by heating up the product
###1985 to 180 degrees. This isn't necessary, what this does is it helps create a thicker yogurt;
###1985 helps kind of loosen up the structure of the proteins so that when bacteria come, it will
###1987 help tie them a little bit better. This is the yogurt after it's finished; so after you
###1987 heat up to 180 degrees, you're going to cool it down to about a 100 to a 110 which is the
###1987 ideal temperature to make yogurt at. You're going to add your starter and then you just
###1987 kind of try to leave it at that temperature for a long period of time. I guess, at eight
###1987 to 12 hours up to 24. The longer you leave it, the more sour your product will be. So,
###1987 if you want to less sour product, you leave it for eight hours. You want a more sour product,
###1987 you leave it for 20 hours. Well, what happened is, the enzymes will breakdown and will start
###1988 to sour the product and it will make lactic acid, and it will actually thicken the yogurt
###1991 up. Cheese is a little bit different because you don't actually need the fermentation product
###1991 to make the cheese initially. You need the fermentation product to help ripen the cheese
###1991 afterwards. So, what we're doing is we're adding acid to some kind of milk base and
###1991 heating it to a certain temperature that will actually cause the milk to separate into curds
###1991 and whey; the whey is a liquid and curd is the solids. You can also use rennet which
###1992 is an enzyme as apparent, a lot of animal stomachs--a lot linings of different animals.
###1992 And then what you'll do is you'll strain the whey off, you'll leave the solids and then
###1992 you'll just let them sit. And that's how you'll get the fermentation product of your cheese.
###1992 You can add different strains of bacteria to get different kinds of cheeses and that's
###1992 why there's so many different cheeses on the market because depending on the area they're
###1992 from, depending on what's in the environment, that's where the flavors are coming from.
###1992 Blue cheese is one of the most notorious. It's a very, very, rapidly growing organism
###1992 that spreads very quickly. So, if you're in an environment that made blue cheese, you
###1992 most likely will have everything else in the environment turn into blue cheese or have
###1992 that same mold on it within a couple of days because it's that rapid, it takes over with
###1992 that any other bacteria. Grain ferments; also very popular, we're going to talk about sourdough
###1993 breads. What happens is, when you add the addition of water to grains, you're helping
###1994 activate the yeast that are already naturally on the grains, and you're helping to break
###1996 down those grains to help your body process them a little bit better. The addition of
###1998 water will cause the yeast to activate; they will actually start to eat the carbohydrates
###2010 of the grain themselves and help loosen them, like they're converted into a more digestible
###2013 product. This yeast are found pretty much everywhere, may be kind of sugar, if you've
###2017 ever looked at some kind of plum or grape? That white film on the outside of your fruit
###2021 is actually yeast; they're feeding on the sugars of the fruit itself. So this is how
###2025 you start a basic sourdough bread. All you really do is just take flour and water and
###2027 put them together, put a cover over it and let it sit. What I did for mine is I actually
###2027 used potato water. I cooked some potatoes, after I cooked the potatoes, I saved the water
###2027 and I turned that into a sourdough bread. That extra starch from the potatoes just give
###2027 something extra for the yeast to heat on. So what you'll do is, you mix those two products
###2027 together, let it sit at the ideal temperature again from 80 to 110 degrees in an open air
###2027 container. You want to leave it open air at the beginning because this is where the yeast
###2027 are going to come from, they're going to come from the air. You can add baker's yeast if
###2027 you want but that kind of defeats the purpose of having this sourdough that's made with
###2027 things that are naturally occurring in the environment. You have that sit overnight with
###2027 the temperature–-the ideal temperature, the next day you come back to it, you remove
###2027 half of it, and then add the same amount of flour and water that you removed. It's introduced
###2027 again, newer yeast helps add some more carbohydrates so that the yeast can feed up and proliferate
###2027 more. You do this for about three to four days until you start to see a bubble. Once
###2027 it bubbles, then you have a solid starter. That bubbling means that the yeast are active,
###2027 they're creating lactic acid which is where that sourness is going to come from, and it
###2027 means that, they're going to continue to be active as long as they keep being fed, as
###2027 long as you keep the phytonutrients of heat and sugar for them, they'll keep going. So
###2027 these starters can pretty much be kept indefinitely. Some of the sourdoughs from the San Francisco
###2027 are over a hundred years old because they started sourdough a hundred years ago. They
###2027 take out half of it, make bread, add more flour and water, and they just keep making
###2027 it everyday using that same starter. And then over time, it evolves a lot of different flavors
###2027 from a lot of different organisms. This is another fermentation practice which, if you
###2027 watch my Twitter, this is one of the first things that I have kind of experiments with,
###2027 is fermented oatmeal. You take any kind of oats, soak it in water overnight, and the
###2027 yeast present in the oatmeal will actually kind of breakdown starch and will result in
###2027 a very, very kind of creamy gelatins oatmeal. Fruit Ferments, we see this with wine. We
###2027 see this with different kinds of root beers, we see this with–-I guess it would be grain,
###2027 we see this is as normal beer, as well that the addition of fruit is normal in making
###2027 normal beers. What are you doing is basically again taking those naturally occurring yeast
###2027 in the air and they're feeding off the sugar of the fruit. Specific sugars would kind of
###2027 help change for the final fermentation and add the final flavor. So, if you're using
###2027 honey, if you're using molasses, if you're using sorghum, if you're using brown sugar,
###2027 each one of these sugars has a different flavor profile and different types of organisms that
###2027 be attracted to, let's say, honey then brown sugar. That's pretty much it. I have a bunch
###2027 of products here that we're all going to taste. I have a fruit kimchi that's made with pineapple,
###2027 grapes, cilantro, ginger, some other spices; again, let it sit it for a week. I have a
###2027 normal kimchi that's made in a very traditional style, this has radish, some greens, chili
###2027 pepper, garlic, ginger. I have homemade sauerkraut that has the addition of apples and onions
###2027 to it. I have some yogurts. I have a full fat yogurt that's made of 40% fat. Kind of
###2027 comes out to the consistency of sour cream. I also have a normal fat, with a 5% fat yogurt.
###2027 I also have some butter that was made with the yogurt; let me talk about that process
###2027 if you like. And I also have some--it's a ginger beer recipe but I made it with galangal.
###2027 Basically, took ginger, shred it up, mixed it with sugar and water to have the environment
###2027 so that the yeast can grow. Once they started to grow, you add that to a base ginger and
###2027 sugar. Once you put on that base, you add the starter that you made with the active
###2027 cultures then you put it in an anaerobic environment by putting into a bottle and letting it sit.
###2027 This will start to create--they will eat the sugars and create alcohol and CO2, and that's
###2027 when the carbonation comes from because they're concentrating that CO2 into the bottle; so,
###2027 it can't escape, so, it's infusing itself into the water to create carbonation. So,
###2027 yeah, if you guys want to come up and have a taste some stuff. That's pretty much it
###2027 for the fermentation talk. In case you have any questions you guys [INDISTINCT].
