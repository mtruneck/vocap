CARL AZUZ, CNN ANCHOR: Welcome to CNN STUDENT
NEWS, your commercial- free source for news


2
0:0:4,55 --> 0:0:8,65
for middle and high school classrooms. My
name is Carl Azuz. Returning from the Thanksgiving


3
0:0:8,65 --> 0:0:24,7
holiday, our first story today will take us
to the Middle East.


4
0:0:24,7 --> 0:0:29,61
There has been a break in the fighting between
Israelis and Palestinians. A cease-fire started


5
0:0:29,61 --> 0:0:34,39
to take hold last week. And the two sides
are scheduled to meet today in Egypt where


6
0:0:34,39 --> 0:0:39,4
they`ll discuss what they want as part of
a longer term peace deal. The most recent


7
0:0:39,4 --> 0:0:44,71
conflict lasted eight days in mid-November
and left dozens of Palestinians and six Israelis


8
0:0:44,71 --> 0:0:49,44
dead. Palestinians fired rockets from the
region of Gaza that exploded in the Israeli


9
0:0:49,44 --> 0:0:54,65
communities, and Israel launched air strikes
targeting Palestinian militants that also


10
0:0:54,65 --> 0:0:59,59
caused civilian casualties. Israeli forces
had been preparing for a possible invasion


11
0:0:59,59 --> 0:1:4,93
of Gaza last week, that`s when the U.S., the
U.N. and Egypt got involved, helping get the


12
0:1:4,93 --> 0:1:9,65
two sides to agree to a cease-fire. That happened
last Wednesday, and though there has been


13
0:1:9,65 --> 0:1:14,35
some limited fighting since then, the cease
fire appears to be holding.


14
0:1:14,35 --> 0:1:19,1
Egypt, meanwhile, is having some trouble of
its own: in the capital city of Cairo where


15
0:1:19,1 --> 0:1:24,56
massive protests led to the ouster of its
formal leader in 2011, there were clashes


16
0:1:24,56 --> 0:1:30,7
yesterday. They were between protesters and
government forces. Many Egyptians are angry


17
0:1:30,7 --> 0:1:36,57
with their new president Mohamed Morsi. Last
Thursday, Morsi issued this edict that basically


18
0:1:36,57 --> 0:1:42,99
says: any decree or law that he has made since
he took office cannot be overturned by Egyptian


19
0:1:42,99 --> 0:1:48,689
courts until a new constitution is finished.
That can happen in six months, and that, along


20
0:1:48,689 --> 0:1:54,6
with some of his other actions, has some Egyptians
calling him a dictator. Morsi is promising


21
0:1:54,6 --> 0:1:57,549
his new powers are only temporary.


22
0:1:57,549 --> 0:2:1,81
China is the third stop in our international
coverage today. Something you don`t see very


23
0:2:1,81 --> 0:2:8,289
often: a house on a highway. Look at this.
A neighborhood was torn down to make way for


24
0:2:8,289 --> 0:2:12,84
the road you see right here. But the farmer
who lives in this house, says the government


25
0:2:12,84 --> 0:2:20,29
offered him $35,000 to leave his property
when he paid $95,000 to build it. The government


26
0:2:20,29 --> 0:2:24,65
raised the offer to 41,000, but that still
wasn`t enough for the farmer. So officials


27
0:2:24,65 --> 0:2:29,59
literally built the road around the house.
It`s not yet open to traffic, and the local


28
0:2:29,59 --> 0:2:33,34
officials expect the homeowner to work out
a deal with the government soon. But this


29
0:2:33,34 --> 0:2:38,99
has become symbolic of the struggle between
Chinese homeowners and the government that


30
0:2:38,99 --> 0:2:40,439
they say doesn`t offer them enough money to
relocate.


31
0:2:40,439 --> 0:2:41,599
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


32
0:2:41,599 --> 0:2:48,419
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: It`s time for "The Shoutout."
The term "bicameral" means having two of what?


33
0:2:48,419 --> 0:2:54,379
If you think you know it, then shout it out!
Is it: parties, lenses, cylinders or chambers?


34
0:2:54,379 --> 0:2:56,2
You`ve got three seconds, go!


35
0:2:56,2 --> 0:3:10,79
In 
a bicameral legislature, there are two chambers
or houses. That`s your answer, and that`s


36
0:3:10,79 --> 0:3:11,489
your "Shoutout."


37
0:3:11,489 --> 0:3:13,62
(END VIDEO CLIP)


38
0:3:13,62 --> 0:3:18,579
AZUZ: Those who serve in America`s bicameral
legislature, are back at work today, and along


39
0:3:18,579 --> 0:3:23,439
with the president, representatives and senators
have a major challenge ahead in December:


40
0:3:23,439 --> 0:3:27,859
the fiscal cliff you`ve heard us talk about.
Senators and representatives and the president


41
0:3:27,859 --> 0:3:32,269
are trying to find a way to avoid this. And
it all comes down to agree on how the government


42
0:3:32,269 --> 0:3:37,309
spends money and takes in money. But with
Democrats controlling the Senate and Republicans


43
0:3:37,309 --> 0:3:41,73
controlling the House of Representatives,
Athena Jones explains how compromise is going


44
0:3:41,73 --> 0:3:42,87
to be the name of the game.


45
0:3:42,87 --> 0:3:43,459
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


46
0:3:43,459 --> 0:3:46,769
ATHENA JONES, CNN CORRESPONDENT: After meeting
with President Obama before the Thanksgiving


47
0:3:46,769 --> 0:3:47,29
holiday ...


48
0:3:47,29 --> 0:3:50,189
BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA: Well, I want to welcome the congressional


49
0:3:50,189 --> 0:3:50,87
leadership here ...


50
0:3:50,87 --> 0:3:56,29
JONES: Congressional leaders expressed optimism
about reaching a deal to avoid $500 billion


51
0:3:56,29 --> 0:4:0,37
in tax increases and spending cuts set to
take effect next year.


52
0:4:0,37 --> 0:4:3,499
REP. JOHN BOEHNER, (R ), HOUSE SPEAKER: We
had a very constructive meeting with the president


53
0:4:3,499 --> 0:4:6,389
to talk about America`s fiscal problem.


54
0:4:6,389 --> 0:4:9,609
SEN. HARRY REID (D), NEVADA: We have the cornerstones
of being able to work something out.


55
0:4:9,609 --> 0:4:13,829
JONES: Staffers have been working behind the
scenes to find common ground. Among the big


56
0:4:13,829 --> 0:4:19,41
sticking points, how to bring in more tax
revenue and reduce spending on programs like


57
0:4:19,41 --> 0:4:19,79
Medicare.


58
0:4:19,79 --> 0:4:25,29
But it`s not yet clear when lawmakers and
the president will meet next. And even if


59
0:4:25,29 --> 0:4:30,8
some progress is made this week, a final deal
could still be a long way off.


60
0:4:30,8 --> 0:4:34,32
JENNIFER LIBERTO, CNNMONEY.COM SENIOR WRITER:
We barely see the Hill and the White House


61
0:4:34,32 --> 0:4:39,24
make decisions early. They tend to do better
when they have a deadline.


62
0:4:39,24 --> 0:4:40,8
(END VIDEOTAPE)


63
0:4:40,8 --> 0:4:44,18
AZUZ: That deadline at this time is January
1. That`s how long Congress has to reach an


64
0:4:44,18 --> 0:4:46,4
agreement on the fiscal cliff.


65
0:4:46,4 --> 0:4:51,22
The U.S. northeast, still cleaning up from
Superstorm Sandy, it will be for quite a while,


66
0:4:51,22 --> 0:4:57,51
officials say sanitation crews have picked
up 280,000 tons of trash and debris in New


67
0:4:57,51 --> 0:5:3,48
York alone. But while gas rationing is over,
transportation is getting back to normal,


68
0:5:3,48 --> 0:5:8,35
thousands of people in New York and New Jersey
still didn`t have power going into the weekend


69
0:5:8,35 --> 0:5:10,63
and many still didn`t have heat.


70
0:5:10,63 --> 0:5:15,32
That, along with some other factors have created
some new problems for storm victims. Mary


71
0:5:15,32 --> 0:5:18,2
Snow reports on the dangers you can`t see.


72
0:5:18,2 --> 0:5:18,43
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


73
0:5:18,43 --> 0:5:22,54
MARY SNOW, CNN CORRESPONDENT: Lurking in the
devastation from Sandy is yet another worry


74
0:5:22,54 --> 0:5:28,94
for homeowners. Exposure to toxins, mold and
dust and in some places, sewage.


75
0:5:28,94 --> 0:5:33,44
Long Beach homeowner Fred Morello will only
enter his house wearing a protective suit


76
0:5:33,44 --> 0:5:38,9
and mask as he clears out areas that were
submerged in several feet of water.


77
0:5:38,9 --> 0:5:43,62
FRED MORELLO, LONG BEACH HOMEOWNER: I`m concerned
about molds? Sure. But at this particular


78
0:5:43,62 --> 0:5:48,26
point, I don`t have a time for it. I have
things to get done. And they`ve got to get


79
0:5:48,26 --> 0:5:50,52
done. So I protect myself as best I can.


80
0:5:50,52 --> 0:5:55,12
SNOW: While Morello says, he has no time to
get checked for the cough he now has, others


81
0:5:55,12 --> 0:6:0,38
have been showing up to MASH-like tents set
up by federal disaster medical assistance


82
0:6:0,38 --> 0:6:0,73
teams.


83
0:6:0,73 --> 0:6:2,97
(on camera): You`ve been to other disaster
areas.


84
0:6:2,97 --> 0:6:3,3
UNIDENTIFIED MALE: Correct.


85
0:6:3,3 --> 0:6:7,38
SNOW (voice over): Commander Kevin McGuillakati
(ph) says besides people seeking psychological


86
0:6:7,38 --> 0:6:12,37
treatment, they`ve mostly come in complaining
of coughs, bronchitis and asthma. Since the


87
0:6:12,37 --> 0:6:14,0
base was set up November 13th.


88
0:6:14,0 --> 0:6:14,89

89
0:6:14,89 --> 0:6:15,78
(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)


90
0:6:15,78 --> 0:6:21,33
UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: What`s the word? The
major online shopping event that follows Black


91
0:6:21,33 --> 0:6:29,79
Friday? Cyber Monday, that`s the word.


92
0:6:29,79 --> 0:6:32,3
(END VIDEO CLIP)


93
0:6:32,3 --> 0:6:38,3
AZUZ: And we have reports on both of those
shopping days. First today, Cyber Monday when


94
0:6:38,3 --> 0:6:43,21
discounts are offered online. Definitely,
it doesn`t look as hectic as many Black Friday


95
0:6:43,21 --> 0:6:47,36
events, but Cyber Monday shoppers who will
be dressed in everything from business suits


96
0:6:47,36 --> 0:6:51,3
at work to pajamas at home will be surfing
for sales.


97
0:6:51,3 --> 0:6:56,66
A couple of interesting notes this year: Cyber
Monday 2012 actually started last week. Online


98
0:6:56,66 --> 0:7:2,22
discounts were offered before and on Thanksgiving
and during the weekend. Also, more Americans


99
0:7:2,22 --> 0:7:7,79
are doing their shopping on phones and tablets
this time around, and many are looking for


100
0:7:7,79 --> 0:7:11,1
phone and tablet discounts online as well.


101
0:7:11,1 --> 0:7:15,71
As far as Black Friday itself went more shoppers
turned out for the event than last year, but


102
0:7:15,71 --> 0:7:20,56
they didn`t appear to spend as much money.
This Youtube clip shows you one of the hectic


103
0:7:20,56 --> 0:7:26,22
Black Friday scenes: crowds clamoring to get
in the malls and big box stores like Target


104
0:7:26,22 --> 0:7:32,48
or Toys "R" Us. Black Friday store visits
went up 3.5 percent from 2011, but spending


105
0:7:32,48 --> 0:7:38,62
was down by almost two percent. That could
be partly because many sales started before


106
0:7:38,62 --> 0:7:43,87
Black Friday, so some folks might have shopped
early. Retailers and analysts pay close attention


107
0:7:43,87 --> 0:7:48,6
to all of this stuff to get a sense of how
Americans are spending in a slow economy.


108
0:7:48,6 --> 0:7:53,94
Don`t know yet how they are spending, but
we do know what many Americans are eating:


109
0:7:53,94 --> 0:7:58,56
leftover turkey, a bird banquet is part of
Thanksgiving tradition for many of us. But


110
0:7:58,56 --> 0:8:3,81
there is another tradition dating back to
1989 that you might not have heard about:


111
0:8:3,81 --> 0:8:9,73
the presidential turkey pardon. It guarantees
at least one bird won`t wind up on anyone`s


112
0:8:9,73 --> 0:8:14,139
table. Karin Caifa tells us where these lucky
turkeys go to leave.


113
0:8:14,139 --> 0:8:15,6
(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)


114
0:8:15,6 --> 0:8:18,16
KARIN CAIFA, CNN CORRESPONDENT: An annual
reprise:


115
0:8:18,16 --> 0:8:21,97
BILL CLINTON: I`m told that Jerry the Turkey
travel all the way here from Wisconsin.


116
0:8:21,97 --> 0:8:24,8
CAIFA: A long line of lucky birds:


117
0:8:24,8 --> 0:8:30,5
GEORGE W. BUSH: May and Flower, they are certainly
better than the names the vice president suggested,


118
0:8:30,5 --> 0:8:33,11
which was Lunch and Dinner.


119
0:8:33,11 --> 0:8:34,69
(laughter)


120
0:8:34,69 --> 0:8:39,809
CAIFA: On Wednesday, President Obama added
Gobbler and Cobbler to that least, the annual


121
0:8:39,809 --> 0:8:41,5
White House turkey pardon.


122
0:8:41,5 --> 0:8:43,539
BARACK OBAMA, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES
OF AMERICA: I have one more gift to give,


123
0:8:43,539 --> 0:8:48,72
and it goes to a pair of turkeys named Cobbler
and Gobbler.


124
0:8:48,72 --> 0:8:53,689
CAIFA: But after the camera stopped rolling,
and the president heads back to the Oval Office,


125
0:8:53,689 --> 0:8:58,55
what does happen to those pardoned turkeys?
Well, they`ll come right here, to the home


126
0:8:58,55 --> 0:9:3,449
of the nation`s first president. First stop,
this specially prepared pen on the grounds


127
0:9:3,449 --> 0:9:8,67
of Mount Vernon, George Washington`s historic
estate in Virginia. They`ll be a main attraction


128
0:9:8,67 --> 0:9:12,85
at a holiday festival for six weeks. Then,
a tranquil retirement.


129
0:9:12,85 --> 0:9:15,959
DEAN NORTON, MOUNT VERNON HORTICULTURE DIRECTOR:
After the six weeks, they`ll move back to


130
0:9:15,959 --> 0:9:19,319
our livestock department, and be with all
sorts of other animals, and you are just always


131
0:9:19,319 --> 0:9:20,93
thrilled when they get back there.


132
0:9:20,93 --> 0:9:24,54
CAIFA: Historically, it`s appropriate. It
was George Washington who suggested a national


133
0:9:24,54 --> 0:9:31,68
day of Thanksgiving in 1789. Giving thanks
for life beyond Thanksgiving dinner. In Washington,


134
0:9:31,68 --> 0:9:34,18
I`m Karin Caifa for CNN STUDENT NEWS.

0:9:34,18 --> 0:9:34,91
(END VIDEOTAPE)


136
0:9:34,91 --> 0:9:39,779
AZUZ: It`s hard to think of puns for the word
"turkey" I mean there are other ideas we could


137
0:9:39,779 --> 0:9:44,18
shout from the rafters like that gobbles up
our time for today. When we couldn`t a leg


138
0:9:44,18 --> 0:9:48,309
up on any great ideas, and when the whole
gang couldn`t cook up anything better, we


139
0:9:48,309 --> 0:11:48,309
just decided to wing it. CNN STUDENT NEWS
continues tomorrow. I hope to see you then.
