1
0:0:10,476 --> 0:0:12,778
NARRATOR: On this
episode of Wicked Tuna.


2
0:0:12,778 --> 0:0:14,513
BILL: We're on our
second week with Paul,


3
0:0:14,513 --> 0:0:15,681
I was expecting better.


4
0:0:15,681 --> 0:0:17,516
Go forward.
PAUL: Go, Billy, go.


5
0:0:17,516 --> 0:0:18,918
DAVE: It's gonna be more
competitive than it ever


6
0:0:18,918 --> 0:0:19,985
has been.


7
0:0:19,985 --> 0:0:21,921
I got no problem carrying
this on at the dock.


8
0:0:21,921 --> 0:0:24,49
SCOTT: Come over
here you BLEEP.


9
0:0:24,49 --> 0:0:26,959
RALPH: If Pirate doesn't get
his act together, BLEEP,


10
0:0:26,959 --> 0:0:29,295
we may have to make some
difficult decisions.


11
0:0:29,295 --> 0:0:31,564
PIRATE: Trying my patience
out pretty BLEEP good.


12
0:0:31,564 --> 0:0:32,531
RALPH: Big fish.
Fish on.


13
0:0:32,531 --> 0:0:33,599
PIRATE: Fish on.
RALPH: Fish on.


14
0:0:33,599 --> 0:0:36,235
DAVE: Horrible BLEEP day.


15
0:0:36,235 --> 0:0:39,939
PAUL: This is
BLEEP war, bitch.


16
0:0:39,939 --> 0:0:41,474
NARRATOR: Fishing
is a hard life.


17
0:0:41,474 --> 0:0:43,75
RALPH: There's gonna be
a confrontation here.


18
0:0:43,75 --> 0:0:45,244
NARRATOR: And harder with
bluefin stocks depleted.


19
0:0:45,244 --> 0:0:47,78
In Gloucester, Massachusetts,
there's a special breed


20
0:0:47,78 --> 0:0:48,914
of fishermen.


21
0:0:48,914 --> 0:0:51,383
For generations, they've
used rod and reel to catch


22
0:0:51,383 --> 0:0:52,952
the elusive bluefin tuna.


23
0:0:52,952 --> 0:0:54,153
JAY: Yeah, baby!


24
0:0:54,153 --> 0:0:56,589
NARRATOR: They depend on
these fish for their survival.


25
0:0:56,589 --> 0:0:58,57
The competition is brutal.


26
0:0:58,57 --> 0:0:59,358
SCOTT: Miserable prick.


27
0:0:59,358 --> 0:1:7,133
NARRATOR: This is Wicked Tuna.


28
0:1:7,133 --> 0:1:9,869
DAVE: Go, go.
It's great to be on top.


29
0:1:9,869 --> 0:1:12,4
It's great to make all
the money, but with that,


30
0:1:12,4 --> 0:1:13,739
nobody likes a winner.


31
0:1:13,739 --> 0:1:16,108
MARCIANO: For me, the money
doesn't fall out of the sky,


32
0:1:16,108 --> 0:1:17,977
it comes out of the sea.


33
0:1:17,977 --> 0:1:19,445
BILL: This gets harder
as you get older,


34
0:1:19,445 --> 0:1:20,98
but I'm keeping up
with the young guns.


35
0:1:20,98 --> 0:1:22,214
Get out of the way.


36
0:1:22,214 --> 0:1:23,816
RALPH: If it's on my mind,
you're gonna hear about it.


37
0:1:23,816 --> 0:1:25,518
And if you did something
to me, I'm gonna do something


38
0:1:25,518 --> 0:1:44,69
back to you.


39
0:1:44,69 --> 0:1:46,238
It's been a rough
stretch on the Odysea.


40
0:1:46,238 --> 0:1:47,773
We haven't caught
anything in a while.


41
0:1:47,773 --> 0:1:51,31
We know the season's coming to
an end in the next two weeks,


42
0:1:51,31 --> 0:1:53,812
so it's been getting
very stressful.


43
0:1:53,812 --> 0:1:55,915
Hey, where'd that tackle
go from yesterday with


44
0:1:55,915 --> 0:1:58,17
that spool of line?


45
0:1:58,17 --> 0:1:59,885
PIRATE: I put it right, it's
right there by the cupboard.


46
0:1:59,885 --> 0:2:1,42
RALPH: Oh.


47
0:2:1,42 --> 0:2:3,322
PIRATE: Lately me and the
captain haven't been seeing


48
0:2:3,322 --> 0:2:5,357
eye to eye because
of the stressfulness


49
0:2:5,357 --> 0:2:7,493
of not catching a fish.


50
0:2:7,493 --> 0:2:9,662
RALPH: Alright, come on.
Untie the lines.


51
0:2:9,662 --> 0:2:13,499
PIRATE: I got it now. That thing
is BLEEP. Aww.


52
0:2:13,499 --> 0:2:16,635
RALPH: Well, you had it. You
had it, and you BLEEP it up.


53
0:2:16,635 --> 0:2:18,37
PIRATE: I'm trying, Ralph!


54
0:2:18,37 --> 0:2:19,638
RALPH: But you had it,
and you BLEEP it up.


55
0:2:19,638 --> 0:2:21,707
PIRATE: I was waiting for you,
and you're gonna yell at me if


56
0:2:21,707 --> 0:2:23,976
I do something wrong anyways.
RALPH: No, I was waiting for you


57
0:2:23,976 --> 0:2:26,178
It's too difficult to think
about how to hold the boat while


58
0:2:26,178 --> 0:2:28,38
you let go of the lines.


59
0:2:28,38 --> 0:2:30,749
I don't understand what your
BLEEP brain fart is with that


60
0:2:30,749 --> 0:2:32,17
BLEEP.


61
0:2:32,17 --> 0:2:34,253
PIRATE: You know, when the
captain gets grouchy and starts


62
0:2:34,253 --> 0:2:37,56
yelling at me this early in
the morning, you know, hey,


63
0:2:37,56 --> 0:2:39,992
it's part of it, so I just take
it and hopefully we go catch a


64
0:2:39,992 --> 0:2:43,629
fish later on this afternoon
and smooth things out.


65
0:2:43,629 --> 0:2:46,365
RALPH: I have to be able to
rely on Pirate to catch a fish.


66
0:2:46,365 --> 0:2:49,935
It's not gonna happen
with his stupidity.


67
0:2:49,935 --> 0:2:51,87
We've been in a bit
of a slump lately,


68
0:2:51,87 --> 0:2:54,406
so we're gonna head out
to Jeffrey's Ledge today.


69
0:2:54,406 --> 0:2:56,408
We haven't spent much time at
that place this year so we're


70
0:2:56,408 --> 0:2:59,11
just gonna change it up and
see if we can catch a big one.


71
0:2:59,11 --> 0:3:1,146
I'm just praying that we're
gonna catch a couple fish before


72
0:3:1,146 --> 0:3:8,254
the season wraps up.


73
0:3:8,254 --> 0:3:10,55
BILL: Hello.


74
0:3:10,55 --> 0:3:12,725
SCOTT: Come on. Let's go. You
guys are late.


75
0:3:12,725 --> 0:3:14,46
Let's go.
Pick up the pace.


76
0:3:14,46 --> 0:3:16,128
BILL: We're in our
second week with Paul.


77
0:3:16,128 --> 0:3:18,197
He left Dot Com.


78
0:3:18,197 --> 0:3:22,368
We still haven't caught one,
and I was expecting better.


79
0:3:22,368 --> 0:3:24,803
SCOTT: Come on, let's go.


80
0:3:24,803 --> 0:3:28,107
The stakes are extremely
high for Bill and Donna.


81
0:3:28,107 --> 0:3:31,76
I've heard them say to me,
if we don't catch some fish,


82
0:3:31,76 --> 0:3:32,978
I'm gonna have to sell the boat.


83
0:3:32,978 --> 0:3:36,782
If Paul doesn't start sharing
some of Dot Com's secrets,


84
0:3:36,782 --> 0:3:40,853
he's gonna be off the boat
and we're done for the season.


85
0:3:40,853 --> 0:3:43,389
BILL: Paul's taking us over
to Cape Cod Bay on this trip.


86
0:3:43,389 --> 0:3:44,823
He grew up fishing there.


87
0:3:44,823 --> 0:3:48,127
He knows that area like
the back of his hand.


88
0:3:48,127 --> 0:3:51,764
PAUL: Take them to a
little honey hole spot.


89
0:3:51,764 --> 0:3:53,899
I hope I bring some luck.


90
0:3:53,899 --> 0:3:56,435
BILL: I had high hopes
for Paul, but again,


91
0:3:56,435 --> 0:4:13,485
this could turn out to be
another failed crewmember.


92
0:4:13,485 --> 0:4:14,92
DAVE: Paul going on
Billy's boat now, gonna be


93
0:4:14,92 --> 0:4:17,556
more competitive with Billy
and I than it ever has been.


94
0:4:17,556 --> 0:4:20,192
Going out to Cape Cod Bay today
because that's Paul's neck of


95
0:4:20,192 --> 0:4:21,393
the woods.


96
0:4:21,393 --> 0:4:23,495
I guarantee you, Paul and Bill
will be there because


97
0:4:23,495 --> 0:4:25,3
Paul is predictable.


98
0:4:25,3 --> 0:4:28,367
And I'm gonna catch one right in
his backyard with him watching.


99
0:4:28,367 --> 0:4:34,707
That's my choice
for today's bait.


100
0:4:34,707 --> 0:4:37,676
SANDRO: All set up.


101
0:4:37,676 --> 0:4:39,845
DAVE: This is my
lucky rod right here.


102
0:4:39,845 --> 0:4:41,313
The season's almost over now.


103
0:4:41,313 --> 0:4:42,915
There's not a lot of
fish around anymore.


104
0:4:42,915 --> 0:4:45,117
The less and less fish
that are out here,


105
0:4:45,117 --> 0:4:46,819
the more money
that you can make.


106
0:4:46,819 --> 0:5:2,701
Paul can go screw himself.


107
0:5:2,701 --> 0:5:5,738
BILL: Paul brought us to
one of his secret spots,


108
0:5:5,738 --> 0:5:8,44
and it turns out Dot
Com's already there.


109
0:5:8,44 --> 0:5:11,21
SCOTT: Dave knows exactly
how Paul thinks.


110
0:5:11,21 --> 0:5:13,912
It's a real problem.


111
0:5:13,912 --> 0:5:15,781
PAUL: Alive.


112
0:5:15,781 --> 0:5:21,387
BILL: Come in. Dave, come in.


113
0:5:21,387 --> 0:5:28,494
Called Dave, and
they didn't pick up.


114
0:5:28,494 --> 0:5:30,996
SCOTT: Bill's a really
good-natured guy at heart.


115
0:5:30,996 --> 0:5:33,198
He gives everybody the
benefit of the doubt.


116
0:5:33,198 --> 0:5:36,835
I'm just the opposite, Dave
Dot Com really gets to me.


117
0:5:36,835 --> 0:5:38,937
PAUL: If Dave gets
the bite and we don't,


118
0:5:38,937 --> 0:5:42,574
I'm gonna be BLEEP pissed.
I'm gonna stretch this.


119
0:5:42,574 --> 0:5:45,277
Can people not walk on it?


120
0:5:45,277 --> 0:5:46,879
I've been on the
boat couple weeks.


121
0:5:46,879 --> 0:5:49,815
We haven't caught a fish yet.
I'm feeling the pressure.


122
0:5:49,815 --> 0:5:51,95
I really want to catch one.
Billy, which one?


123
0:5:51,95 --> 0:5:53,285
You gotta pick it.


124
0:5:53,285 --> 0:5:54,92
BILL: The first one.
PAUL: This one?


125
0:5:54,92 --> 0:5:56,989
BILL: I like the color.


126
0:5:56,989 --> 0:5:59,758
SCOTT: Paul's the master
baiter. He's the master baiter.


127
0:5:59,758 --> 0:6:1,827
PAUL: Dude, I did
that when I was young.


128
0:6:1,827 --> 0:6:3,662
SCOTT: If we don't
catch some fish,


129
0:6:3,662 --> 0:6:6,131
this season's gonna
be a total disaster.


130
0:6:6,131 --> 0:6:8,467
BILL: We're gonna
kill a fish today, and


131
0:6:8,467 --> 0:6:10,936
it's gonna be big enough.


132
0:6:10,936 --> 0:6:18,51
PAUL: Or it's gonna kill us.


133
0:6:18,51 --> 0:6:20,512
MARCIANO: We're going over to
get a little fuel this morning.


134
0:6:20,512 --> 0:6:22,548
MAN: Hey, Dave.
MARCIANO: How goes the battle?


135
0:6:22,548 --> 0:6:23,582
MAN: It's there.


136
0:6:23,582 --> 0:6:25,17
MARCIANO: How's
the price today?


137
0:6:25,17 --> 0:6:27,453
MAN: Ah, it's up, $3.58.


138
0:6:27,453 --> 0:6:28,72
MARCIANO: Uh oh,
that's alright,


139
0:6:28,72 --> 0:6:31,223
the kids just won't eat this
week, don't worry about it.


140
0:6:31,223 --> 0:6:34,226
The price went up a little
bit, not devastating,


141
0:6:34,226 --> 0:6:37,62
I think three cents
from the last time.


142
0:6:37,62 --> 0:6:41,99
And that's it.
Just a quick top off.


143
0:6:41,99 --> 0:6:43,635
Alright, thanks, I'll be over
with the check in a minute.


144
0:6:43,635 --> 0:6:45,27
MAN: Alright,
sounds good, Dave.


145
0:6:45,27 --> 0:6:47,372
MARCIANO: We got a real
big paycheck, you know,


146
0:6:47,372 --> 0:6:50,75
for that slob we
caught last week, ah,


147
0:6:50,75 --> 0:6:53,111
which is gonna give me the
ability to pay off my fuel bill.


148
0:6:53,111 --> 0:6:55,914
And unfortunately, it's
gonna be a big one.


149
0:6:55,914 --> 0:6:57,216
MAN: Alright, buddy, we'll
see you in a little bit.


150
0:6:57,216 --> 0:6:59,518
MARCIANO: Alright. It's
important we get back in


151
0:6:59,518 --> 0:7:2,454
the game and produce another
fish here so we can stay in


152
0:7:2,454 --> 0:7:16,1
the black.
It's time to get cracking.


153
0:7:16,1 --> 0:7:22,808
PIRATE: Oh, snagged one. Ah,
still a good one though but.


154
0:7:22,808 --> 0:7:26,512
RALPH: No, no good.
Got to get another one.


155
0:7:26,512 --> 0:7:28,18
Ah, once the boat's
settled up on anchor,


156
0:7:28,18 --> 0:7:31,383
Pirate's number one job,
catch me a live bait.


157
0:7:31,383 --> 0:7:34,52
PIRATE: Well, got
bad news for you.


158
0:7:34,52 --> 0:7:35,587
RALPH: You got one?


159
0:7:35,587 --> 0:7:37,155
No, that bait you
sent down got snagged up on


160
0:7:37,155 --> 0:7:40,726
my jigging stick and fell off.


161
0:7:40,726 --> 0:7:50,669
RALPH: Awwww.
Great. Let it go. BLEEP.


162
0:7:50,669 --> 0:7:52,337
PIRATE: I was reeling
up another bait,


163
0:7:52,337 --> 0:7:54,273
I thought it was another
bait, but it wasn't,


164
0:7:54,273 --> 0:7:57,42
it was one of the baits
we had under the big pole.


165
0:7:57,42 --> 0:7:59,878
I dropped it off, then he
got all wound up about it.


166
0:7:59,878 --> 0:8:2,147
RALPH: It's extremely important
that this time that we stay


167
0:8:2,147 --> 0:8:5,45
focused on the important things
that we need to do to catch a


168
0:8:5,45 --> 0:8:7,586
fish, this way we can
still save the season


169
0:8:7,586 --> 0:8:8,987
and catch a couple tuna.


170
0:8:8,987 --> 0:8:10,822
You better jig now. You got
nothing down there.


171
0:8:10,822 --> 0:8:12,9
PIRATE: Well, I
wanted to make sure.


172
0:8:12,9 --> 0:8:13,592
I didn't know what was going on.


173
0:8:13,592 --> 0:8:15,994
RALPH: I gotta have somebody
that's 100 percent there,


174
0:8:15,994 --> 0:8:19,431
and 100 percent focused
on what's going on.


175
0:8:19,431 --> 0:8:22,434
Well, how many baits we
got on the hooks right now?


176
0:8:22,434 --> 0:8:25,504
None, because you BLEEP
reeled up the bait.


177
0:8:25,504 --> 0:8:28,106
Trying to break out of a
dry slump is hard enough,


178
0:8:28,106 --> 0:8:30,309
but when you get human
error on top of it,


179
0:8:30,309 --> 0:8:49,294
it makes it miserable.


180
0:8:49,294 --> 0:8:51,29
PAUL: We're gonna move into
Cape Cod Bay where


181
0:8:51,29 --> 0:8:54,266
I'm familiar with the fish,
that's my backyard.


182
0:8:54,266 --> 0:8:56,768
If there's fish here,
we're gonna find them.


183
0:8:56,768 --> 0:8:59,938
SCOTT: Kill it dead.


184
0:8:59,938 --> 0:9:13,585
PAUL: We really
gotta catch one.


185
0:9:13,585 --> 0:9:15,687
What the hell?


186
0:9:15,687 --> 0:9:18,724
Lot of boats here for a weekday.


187
0:9:18,724 --> 0:9:21,293
And we were like, what the
BLEEP is that guy doing here?


188
0:9:21,293 --> 0:9:23,595
What the BLEEP are these
guys doing on our spot?


189
0:9:23,595 --> 0:9:26,98
What the BLEEP is
he doing right there?


190
0:9:26,98 --> 0:9:29,768
Look at all the boats and, we
didn't talk to, look it, dude.


191
0:9:29,768 --> 0:9:31,169
BILL: I can't believe he
brought me to a spot where


192
0:9:31,169 --> 0:9:34,239
there's a million freaking
googans. I'm not happy.


193
0:9:34,239 --> 0:9:39,277
Googan's a beginner, doesn't
ask about what he should do.


194
0:9:39,277 --> 0:9:43,115
Doesn't know what to do,
and gets in the way and


195
0:9:43,115 --> 0:9:45,384
cost you money.
That's all they do.


196
0:9:45,384 --> 0:9:48,12
They've cost me a lot
of money this year.


197
0:9:48,12 --> 0:9:49,321
SCOTT: Googan.


198
0:9:49,321 --> 0:9:51,39
BILL: And, ah, tell you right
now, if he comes near me,


199
0:9:51,39 --> 0:9:53,291
I'm gonna BLEEP,
I'll lose my mind.


200
0:9:53,291 --> 0:9:54,76
I'm gonna get off the
BLEEP anchor and


201
0:9:54,76 --> 0:9:58,196
say get the BLEEP
away from me.


202
0:9:58,196 --> 0:10:1,166
I'm tired of these guys.
Just tired of them.


203
0:10:1,166 --> 0:10:2,901
This is the stuff
that gets me upset.


204
0:10:2,901 --> 0:10:5,404
They just have no
respect for anybody.


205
0:10:5,404 --> 0:10:9,875
Hey, get the
BLEEP out of here!


206
0:10:9,875 --> 0:10:12,144
We're gonna BLEEP
yell at this guy.


207
0:10:12,144 --> 0:10:15,247
I'll come over there and
I'll BLEEP kill you!


208
0:10:15,247 --> 0:10:18,684
He's gonna troll by us all day
long and that's not gonna happen


209
0:10:18,684 --> 0:10:23,722
Come by here again,
you're BLEEP dead!


210
0:10:23,722 --> 0:10:28,293
No respect. That's the
problem. Come on! Yeah,


211
0:10:28,293 --> 0:10:30,28
come over here,
you BLEEP!


212
0:10:30,28 --> 0:10:43,241
Come over here and say that.
No respect whatsoever.


213
0:10:43,241 --> 0:10:44,443
DAVE: Yeah, he's not gonna
anchor there.


214
0:10:44,443 --> 0:10:46,445
He knows better.
Success does breed enemies.


215
0:10:46,445 --> 0:10:50,15
Everybody thinks that you have
something that they don't have.


216
0:10:50,15 --> 0:10:53,952
Aw, he's not setting right
there. He can't.


217
0:10:53,952 --> 0:10:56,221
Other boats have been following
us around all season long and


218
0:10:56,221 --> 0:10:57,456
leeching off us.


219
0:10:57,456 --> 0:10:59,958
And I'm getting sick of it.
It's time to make a stand.


220
0:10:59,958 --> 0:11:2,327
You gotta be BLEEP me!


221
0:11:2,327 --> 0:11:5,363
Why don't you just come
and take my anchor?


222
0:11:5,363 --> 0:11:7,332
SANDRO: Ever since,
ah, Paul quit, I mean,


223
0:11:7,332 --> 0:11:8,667
there's been a lot
of drama out here.


224
0:11:8,667 --> 0:11:10,368
Forget all this drama, I
just want to go fishing.


225
0:11:10,368 --> 0:11:14,439
DAVE: BLEEP unbelievable.


226
0:11:14,439 --> 0:11:17,342
Alright, I'll remember that
next time I get out early.


227
0:11:17,342 --> 0:11:20,579
BLEEP two things I hate,
BLEEP lack of common sense and


228
0:11:20,579 --> 0:11:23,381
stupidity.


229
0:11:23,381 --> 0:11:25,617
BLEEP you want the spot,
you gotta BLEEP get out


230
0:11:25,617 --> 0:11:26,685
here early.


231
0:11:26,685 --> 0:11:28,53
BLEEP people are BLEEP
stupid, you know that.


232
0:11:28,53 --> 0:11:29,688
We get here early, so
nobody BLEEP bothers us.


233
0:11:29,688 --> 0:11:31,523
They come out late, and they
BLEEP want to anchor right on


234
0:11:31,523 --> 0:11:32,591
top of you.


235
0:11:32,591 --> 0:11:33,959
Scumbag, who, that guy's
been around a long time,


236
0:11:33,959 --> 0:11:35,26
he knows what's going on.


237
0:11:35,26 --> 0:11:36,595
It's all about etiquette.


238
0:11:36,595 --> 0:11:38,296
He knows I own the spot and
he's not gonna BLEEP with me.


239
0:11:38,296 --> 0:11:40,232
Oh, there's gonna be a
battle here in a minute.


240
0:11:40,232 --> 0:11:51,276
There will be.


241
0:11:51,276 --> 0:11:54,112
He's anchoring
right on top of us.


242
0:11:54,112 --> 0:11:55,68
But two can play that game.


243
0:11:55,68 --> 0:11:57,549
I tied the anchor off to the
port side now we're gonna run


244
0:11:57,549 --> 0:11:59,5
into him, we might hit him here.


245
0:11:59,5 --> 0:12:4,956
That's what you call
precision anchoring.


246
0:12:4,956 --> 0:12:7,58
SANDRO: Well, scratch one
more off that hates us.


247
0:12:7,58 --> 0:12:9,27
DAVE: Let me tell
you something,


248
0:12:9,27 --> 0:12:11,863
I know you've been around a long
time, but you know I was here.


249
0:12:11,863 --> 0:12:14,966
You BLEEP dropped right on me.


250
0:12:14,966 --> 0:12:17,569
DAVE: And I reset the anchor.
You knew what I was doing.


251
0:12:17,569 --> 0:12:20,405
You've been around a long time.
You know what you did.


252
0:12:20,405 --> 0:12:22,674
I got no problem carrying
this on at the dock.


253
0:12:22,674 --> 0:12:26,278
You tell me where and when,
and I will meet you there.


254
0:12:26,278 --> 0:12:34,586
Just come alone.


255
0:12:34,586 --> 0:12:35,887
SANDRO: The other
guy was just like,


256
0:12:35,887 --> 0:12:36,922
"Let's just get outta here."


257
0:12:36,922 --> 0:12:38,924
DAVE: Is that what he said?
SANDRO: Yeah.


258
0:12:38,924 --> 0:12:40,592
DAVE: Good, that's life.
Sometimes you gotta do


259
0:12:40,592 --> 0:12:43,595
what you gotta do.
Stand your ground.


260
0:12:43,595 --> 0:12:45,263
He wants to come on over
and say something, he can,


261
0:12:45,263 --> 0:12:48,99
but people like to talk when
there's a big body of water


262
0:12:48,99 --> 0:12:49,434
between two boats.


263
0:12:49,434 --> 0:13:3,748
Had it been on the dock, it'd
probably be a different story.


264
0:13:3,748 --> 0:13:13,925
MARCIANO: Oh look, we got the
salad. Oh, oh look. Hair.


265
0:13:13,925 --> 0:13:17,162
Usually the difference between
a good day and a bad day is


266
0:13:17,162 --> 0:13:20,498
whether you put
fish on the boat.


267
0:13:20,498 --> 0:13:24,836
Looks like some rope, some
seaweed, some driftwood,


268
0:13:24,836 --> 0:13:29,608
seem to be able to catch
everything but tuna.


269
0:13:29,608 --> 0:13:39,818
A regular Rembrandt.


270
0:13:39,818 --> 0:13:41,353
BILL: Chum's really
looking good now.


271
0:13:41,353 --> 0:13:43,521
Paul brought me to a spot
where there's a million


272
0:13:43,521 --> 0:13:44,689
freaking googans.


273
0:13:44,689 --> 0:13:46,758
We also want to get
away from Tuna.Com.


274
0:13:46,758 --> 0:13:49,861
So we decided to pick the
anchor up and make a move.


275
0:13:49,861 --> 0:13:52,831
We yanked it up, and
we're already marking.


276
0:13:52,831 --> 0:13:55,834
Marking it down to 60 feet now.


277
0:13:55,834 --> 0:13:58,77
PAUL: You gotta be focused
on what you're doing.


278
0:13:58,77 --> 0:14:1,373
Alls you gotta do is get
the right one under you.


279
0:14:1,373 --> 0:14:7,479
BILL: Come on, Charlie.
PAUL: Come on.


280
0:14:7,479 --> 0:14:10,81
BILL: We're starting to mark
the chum pretty good now.


281
0:14:10,81 --> 0:14:11,383
PAUL: Yep.


282
0:14:11,383 --> 0:14:13,985
BILL: We get one up in the
chum, we'll see them now.


283
0:14:13,985 --> 0:14:27,732
PAUL: Yep. I think he's on.
What's up?


284
0:14:27,732 --> 0:14:37,42
Something was just on this.
Something was just on this.


285
0:14:37,42 --> 0:14:38,843
Something just grabbed this.


286
0:14:38,843 --> 0:14:40,578
BILL: Oh, he might have
taken it. He's right there.


287
0:14:40,578 --> 0:14:42,213
PAUL: I don't know what
happened. Grabbed it.


288
0:14:42,213 --> 0:14:43,548
BILL: Could have.


289
0:14:43,548 --> 0:14:45,283
PAUL: We had a bite.
We had BLEEP bite.


290
0:14:45,283 --> 0:14:47,585
Look at it was in his mouth,
look at this. BLEEP.


291
0:14:47,585 --> 0:14:50,288
He, he bit it and let it go.
BLEEP.


292
0:14:50,288 --> 0:14:55,26
Just, he broke the bait. Mashed
it. He had it in his mouth.


293
0:14:55,26 --> 0:14:56,962
I saw the line
going out a little.


294
0:14:56,962 --> 0:14:59,23
I didn't know.
I thought it was the wave.


295
0:14:59,23 --> 0:15:1,533
SCOTT: BLEEP.
Right where the bait was.


296
0:15:1,533 --> 0:15:4,69
PAUL: Aw yeah, feel,
look at that, Bill.


297
0:15:4,69 --> 0:15:6,237
BILL: Oh wow.


298
0:15:6,237 --> 0:15:11,576
PAUL: He grabbed the BLEEP
bait, it went in his mouth,


299
0:15:11,576 --> 0:15:14,813
down here, and BLEEP
he chomped down.


300
0:15:14,813 --> 0:15:17,382
See where it's all bent?


301
0:15:17,382 --> 0:15:20,18
That's what he did, and
he felt it and let it go.


302
0:15:20,18 --> 0:15:23,521
BILL: Well, we didn't
have any luck today.


303
0:15:23,521 --> 0:15:30,729
Hope Paul comes up with
a better spot tomorrow.


304
0:15:30,729 --> 0:15:34,366
PIRATE: Oh, what a beautiful
one, what a beautiful one.


305
0:15:34,366 --> 0:15:36,735
Oh ho ho ho.


306
0:15:36,735 --> 0:15:39,37
RALPH: I found Pirate fishing
on the deck at the Provincetown


307
0:15:39,37 --> 0:15:43,341
Marina, I saw the passion of
the fishing pole in his eyes and


308
0:15:43,341 --> 0:15:46,544
that's kind of what got me
to offer him the position.


309
0:15:46,544 --> 0:15:50,115
So I tried to work off of his
love and passion for fishing to


310
0:15:50,115 --> 0:15:54,853
try to offset some of his other
basket of issues and to try to


311
0:15:54,853 --> 0:15:57,55
leave them at the dock.


312
0:15:57,55 --> 0:15:59,958
There's no guarantees here.


313
0:15:59,958 --> 0:16:1,86
Just keep putting the baits
out until they work again,


314
0:16:1,86 --> 0:16:3,461
that's all.


315
0:16:3,461 --> 0:16:5,964
What I explained to Pirate in
the beginning, if I yell at you,


316
0:16:5,964 --> 0:16:7,832
it doesn't mean I
don't love you anymore,


317
0:16:7,832 --> 0:16:13,338
it means that something's
potentially going wrong.


318
0:16:13,338 --> 0:16:14,406
PIRATE: Oh man.


319
0:16:14,406 --> 0:16:15,473
RALPH: Look out, look
out, look out, look out.


320
0:16:15,473 --> 0:16:17,409
Look what you got going
on here, Mr. Pirate.


321
0:16:17,409 --> 0:16:18,676
Nice. Nice job. Nice.


322
0:16:18,676 --> 0:16:21,479
PIRATE: I tried stretching
it out and all the water kept


323
0:16:21,479 --> 0:16:22,68
washing it.


324
0:16:22,68 --> 0:16:25,85
RALPH: Nice BLEEP job
you got here, Mr. Pirate.


325
0:16:25,85 --> 0:16:28,86
BLEEP. Pirate
has one responsibility.


326
0:16:28,86 --> 0:16:31,823
His main responsibility is to
pay attention to the lines.


327
0:16:31,823 --> 0:16:34,25
It's real important
in giant tuna fishing,


328
0:16:34,25 --> 0:16:38,229
with the type of line that we
use, not to get it tangled.


329
0:16:38,229 --> 0:16:39,564
Once the line's
tangled, it's ruined.


330
0:16:39,564 --> 0:16:41,399
It gets all these little
bends and kinks in it,


331
0:16:41,399 --> 0:16:43,334
and potentially can break.


332
0:16:43,334 --> 0:16:46,271
So that was the end of that day.
It was kind of frustrating.


333
0:16:46,271 --> 0:16:47,906
Don't put BLEEP
line in moving water.


334
0:16:47,906 --> 0:16:52,21
PIRATE: Sometimes, you know,
you, you might do things that


335
0:16:52,21 --> 0:16:55,58
he don't want you to do, but
yet, I'm not a mind reader so.


336
0:16:55,58 --> 0:16:58,149
RALPH: At the end of the
day it's the captain's


337
0:16:58,149 --> 0:17:0,718
responsibility for
everything running smoothly.


338
0:17:0,718 --> 0:17:2,687
Whether it's
defective equipment,


339
0:17:2,687 --> 0:17:6,691
or it's a defective mate, it's
my responsibility to fix it.


340
0:17:6,691 --> 0:17:8,126
PIRATE: The captain's
got a quick temper,


341
0:17:8,126 --> 0:17:10,595
but at this point in the game,
it's stuff I'm used to this,


342
0:17:10,595 --> 0:17:13,131
so it don't matter anymore.


343
0:17:13,131 --> 0:17:14,732
RALPH: If I say something that
something ain't right and he


344
0:17:14,732 --> 0:17:16,901
like shrugs his shoulders
like he doesn't BLEEP care,


345
0:17:16,901 --> 0:17:19,938
it pisses me off because
I'm trying to help him.


346
0:17:19,938 --> 0:17:22,907
If he doesn't care about
himself, then there is no help.


347
0:17:22,907 --> 0:17:25,71
You don't care, you don't care,
that's the root of the problem.


348
0:17:25,71 --> 0:17:30,348
It doesn't get better till
you care. It pisses me off.


349
0:17:30,348 --> 0:17:49,67
I don't know how much
longer we can do this.


350
0:17:49,67 --> 0:17:50,869
SANDRO: Yeah, it kinda sucks
with Paul not being around


351
0:17:50,869 --> 0:17:52,837
anymore, you know.
It is more work, but.


352
0:17:52,837 --> 0:17:54,606
DAVE: It is what it is.


353
0:17:54,606 --> 0:17:58,343
SANDRO: Yep. You guys had your
differences. That's it.


354
0:17:58,343 --> 0:17:59,978
DAVE: He's been
there a long time.


355
0:17:59,978 --> 0:18:3,448
Hopefully we can be friends and
see what happens with that, but,


356
0:18:3,448 --> 0:18:5,116
unfortunately, I think it's
gonna come in between


357
0:18:5,116 --> 0:18:6,384
Billy and I.


358
0:18:6,384 --> 0:18:7,418
SANDRO: Yeah.


359
0:18:7,418 --> 0:18:9,22
DAVE: For sure. Remember what
I told you.


360
0:18:9,22 --> 0:18:10,488
SANDRO: Yep.


361
0:18:10,488 --> 0:18:13,224
DAVE: The more fish you catch,
the more drama involved.


362
0:18:13,224 --> 0:18:15,46
Hopefully Paul and
I can be friends,


363
0:18:15,46 --> 0:18:16,694
hang out and have a drink.


364
0:18:16,694 --> 0:18:18,429
I hope it comes to that,
but right now, probably not.


365
0:18:18,429 --> 0:18:20,798
SANDRO: Yeah, it's not
looking good unfortunately.


366
0:18:20,798 --> 0:18:23,735
You worried about Paul telling
everybody what we've been doing?


367
0:18:23,735 --> 0:18:25,67
DAVE: How many times has Paul
rigged a bait on the boat?


368
0:18:25,67 --> 0:18:26,838
I do everything.


369
0:18:26,838 --> 0:18:30,308
And how many mates I've had
come and go before Paul?


370
0:18:30,308 --> 0:18:31,676
SANDRO: Yeah, that's true.


371
0:18:31,676 --> 0:18:34,646
DAVE: I can count ten that come
for two years to gain experience


372
0:18:34,646 --> 0:18:35,88
SANDRO: Yeah.


373
0:18:35,88 --> 0:18:37,515
DAVE: And then they leave.
They go fish with someone or


374
0:18:37,515 --> 0:18:39,284
they go buy their own boat, and
you know what they catch?


375
0:18:39,284 --> 0:18:41,219
SANDRO: Nothing.
DAVE: Nothing.


376
0:18:41,219 --> 0:18:43,388
SANDRO: Yeah, exactly.


377
0:18:43,388 --> 0:18:44,589
DAVE: Sure you want
to fish tomorrow?


378
0:18:44,589 --> 0:18:50,995
SANDRO: Oh yeah.


379
0:18:50,995 --> 0:18:52,53
PIRATE: We just got done doing
some fishing,


380
0:18:52,53 --> 0:18:54,699
so now I'm gonna go
uptown and see the boss.


381
0:18:54,699 --> 0:18:56,334
The boss being my honeybee.


382
0:18:56,334 --> 0:18:59,337
And, ah, we're gonna see
what's going on up there.


383
0:18:59,337 --> 0:19:1,339
CINDY: Hello.
PIRATE: Hey honeybee.


384
0:19:1,339 --> 0:19:5,61
CINDY: What's going on? I'm
Cindy, and this is Sergio


385
0:19:5,61 --> 0:19:6,444
the wonder dog.


386
0:19:6,444 --> 0:19:8,179
Can you wave? Yeah.


387
0:19:8,179 --> 0:19:10,782
PIRATE: Can I come aboard, Cap?
CINDY: Come on in.


388
0:19:10,782 --> 0:19:12,16
PIRATE: Been busy today?


389
0:19:12,16 --> 0:19:16,287
CINDY: No, it'd dead as heck.
It's that time of season.


390
0:19:16,287 --> 0:19:17,422
PIRATE: Yeah.


391
0:19:17,422 --> 0:19:18,556
CINDY: I'm making enough.
I'm making my beer money.


392
0:19:18,556 --> 0:19:20,91
He's just one of the
nicest guys I've met.


393
0:19:20,91 --> 0:19:23,628
He's just really sweet.
He's definitely a character.


394
0:19:23,628 --> 0:19:25,53
Why you all dressed up for?
Those aren't fishing clothes.


395
0:19:25,53 --> 0:19:27,265
PIRATE: Just to
come and see you.


396
0:19:27,265 --> 0:19:29,1
CINDY: Seriously?
PIRATE: Of course.


397
0:19:29,1 --> 0:19:30,468
CINDY: I love that.
PIRATE: Yeah.


398
0:19:30,468 --> 0:19:32,804
CINDY: Well, you look good.
PIRATE: Oh, thank you.


399
0:19:32,804 --> 0:19:35,24
CINDY: I think Ralph kind of
looks at Kit at just being


400
0:19:35,24 --> 0:19:38,109
another hand on the boat, but I
hope he takes care of him 'cause


401
0:19:38,109 --> 0:19:39,51
he's more than that to me.


402
0:19:39,51 --> 0:19:41,379
PIRATE: Hopefully we bring
something back this time.


403
0:19:41,379 --> 0:19:44,315
CINDY: You didn't, didn't you
last time, no? You got a baby.


404
0:19:44,315 --> 0:19:45,617
PIRATE: Last time
was a big goose egg.


405
0:19:45,617 --> 0:19:47,518
CINDY: Did you see your picture?
I put in a frame over there.


406
0:19:47,518 --> 0:19:48,686
PIRATE: Oh yeah, yeah,
that's pretty cool.


407
0:19:48,686 --> 0:19:50,421
That's some good fish there.


408
0:19:50,421 --> 0:19:51,556
CINDY: Be safe.


409
0:19:51,556 --> 0:19:53,424
PIRATE: Alright, alright,
I'm gonna get going.


410
0:19:53,424 --> 0:19:55,293
CINDY: Alright. Alright.
Sergio, give him a kiss.


411
0:19:55,293 --> 0:19:57,195
PIRATE: Yeah, wipe
the lipstick off.


412
0:19:57,195 --> 0:20:7,772
No, wipe the lipstick off.


413
0:20:7,772 --> 0:20:9,841
DAVE: Good morning.
SANDRO: Yo.


414
0:20:9,841 --> 0:20:10,942
DAVE: How's the bait look?


415
0:20:10,942 --> 0:20:12,377
SANDRO: Good. We got plenty of
bait.


416
0:20:12,377 --> 0:20:13,645
DAVE: Let's get out
of here quick, uh,


417
0:20:13,645 --> 0:20:15,58
there's not much quota left,
so we gotta make it happen.


418
0:20:15,58 --> 0:20:18,449
I want you to start taking the
boat out, driving out and, ah,


419
0:20:18,449 --> 0:20:19,751
docking.


420
0:20:19,751 --> 0:20:20,752
Just get ready 'cause you're
probably gonna have to take it


421
0:20:20,752 --> 0:20:21,953
on your own.


422
0:20:21,953 --> 0:20:23,254
SANDRO: That's fine with me.
DAVE: You good with that?


423
0:20:23,254 --> 0:20:24,522
SANDRO: Oh yeah.


424
0:20:24,522 --> 0:20:25,857
DAVE: Alright. Sandro's my
first mate, co-captain now and


425
0:20:25,857 --> 0:20:27,58
not Paul, and I really want to
him to understand that. Ready?


426
0:20:27,58 --> 0:20:28,96
SANDRO: Let's get it done.


427
0:20:28,96 --> 0:20:33,64
DAVE: Come on, one
big jumbo today.


428
0:20:33,64 --> 0:20:34,399
Alright, Captain, it's clear.


429
0:20:34,399 --> 0:20:38,903
SANDRO: Yeah.


430
0:20:38,903 --> 0:20:42,473
DAVE: Good job, skipper. I want
him to build his experience and


431
0:20:42,473 --> 0:20:44,475
just let him feel confident
in driving the boat and


432
0:20:44,475 --> 0:20:46,678
let him know we're
okay without Paul.


433
0:20:46,678 --> 0:20:49,314
Paul's been with me over a
decade and I haven't let him


434
0:20:49,314 --> 0:20:50,882
take the boat once.


435
0:20:50,882 --> 0:21:11,769
It's all about trust and
I have that with him.


436
0:21:11,769 --> 0:21:13,171
PIRATE: At the beginning
of the season you know,


437
0:21:13,171 --> 0:21:14,872
we was doing pretty good,
we was hooking up on, ah,


438
0:21:14,872 --> 0:21:17,241
like every other day or
two and then, you know,


439
0:21:17,241 --> 0:21:20,144
after x amount of periods of
time being out that way and


440
0:21:20,144 --> 0:21:22,246
not catching a fish to
bring to market,


441
0:21:22,246 --> 0:21:25,16
that's making my attitude
get a little sour.


442
0:21:25,16 --> 0:21:27,118
Did you eat your
bagel this morning?


443
0:21:27,118 --> 0:21:29,53
How the BLEEP am I gonna eat
my BLEEP bagel when


444
0:21:29,53 --> 0:21:30,621
I'm out here doing this BLEEP?


445
0:21:30,621 --> 0:21:31,989
Cutting bait, every
other BLEEP thing.


446
0:21:31,989 --> 0:21:34,892
RALPH: In the beginning Pirate
seemed like he had the right


447
0:21:34,892 --> 0:21:38,796
attitude, and, you know, he
was committing 100 percent,


448
0:21:38,796 --> 0:21:40,832
and lately, it's changed.


449
0:21:40,832 --> 0:21:45,937
Alright, let that anchor go.


450
0:21:45,937 --> 0:21:48,106
PIRATE: Yeah, if I don't
fall overboard doing it.


451
0:21:48,106 --> 0:21:49,874
Aw, what a mess.


452
0:21:49,874 --> 0:21:51,409
RALPH: Pirate knew what
he was signing up for,


453
0:21:51,409 --> 0:21:53,411
so I don't understand why he's
getting all bent out of shape


454
0:21:53,411 --> 0:21:55,847
with his responsibilities.


455
0:21:55,847 --> 0:22:0,685
PIRATE: Ah. Son of a bitch.
What a mess, what a mess.


456
0:22:0,685 --> 0:22:2,62
RALPH: Pirate's got to fasten
the,


457
0:22:2,62 --> 0:22:4,889
the anchor rope to
the bow of the boat.


458
0:22:4,889 --> 0:22:6,357
PIRATE: Where the
hell is it now?


459
0:22:6,357 --> 0:22:7,892
I can't see the BLEEP line.


460
0:22:7,892 --> 0:22:9,93
BLEEP? Ohhhh. Ahhhh.


461
0:22:9,93 --> 0:22:17,135
BLEEP trying my patience
out pretty BLEEP good today.


462
0:22:17,135 --> 0:22:19,67
BLEEP That wrapping myself
up in the BLEEP mess.


463
0:22:19,67 --> 0:22:25,476
BLEEP worth it,
it's not a joke.


464
0:22:25,476 --> 0:22:27,111
Ah, what's happened
to the BLEEP buoy?


465
0:22:27,111 --> 0:22:29,247
Oh, oh, well. I don't know.


466
0:22:29,247 --> 0:22:37,388
Beats the hell out of me.
Aw you....God damn it.


467
0:22:37,388 --> 0:22:39,524
RALPH: My livelihood and
my safety are at stake and


468
0:22:39,524 --> 0:22:41,58
I don't mess around with that.


469
0:22:41,58 --> 0:22:43,327
If Pirate doesn't get
his act together fast,


470
0:22:43,327 --> 0:22:45,73
we may have to make some
difficult decisions here on


471
0:22:45,73 --> 0:22:50,501
the Odysea.


472
0:22:50,501 --> 0:23:1,512
PIRATE: Another BLEEP
beautiful BLEEP day.


473
0:23:1,512 --> 0:23:3,781
BILL: We're out in Cape Cod Bay
with my new mate, Paul.


474
0:23:3,781 --> 0:23:5,817
We didn't get any
fish the other day.


475
0:23:5,817 --> 0:23:7,685
Time is really pressing on now.


476
0:23:7,685 --> 0:23:9,921
We're in the last couple
of weeks of the season.


477
0:23:9,921 --> 0:23:12,323
Paul doesn't help us get a
fish on this boat pretty soon,


478
0:23:12,323 --> 0:23:14,492
I don't know what I'm gonna do.


479
0:23:14,492 --> 0:23:16,828
SCOTT: You know, at this point,
I'm ready to pack it in and


480
0:23:16,828 --> 0:23:19,53
I never like to pack it in, but,
I had enough of this BLEEP.


481
0:23:19,53 --> 0:23:22,233
I'm ready to just go home.


482
0:23:22,233 --> 0:23:23,334
DAVE'S FRIEND: Ah,
it's coming through,


483
0:23:23,334 --> 0:23:27,238
and three and four on the
screen, four and five.


484
0:23:27,238 --> 0:23:28,306
I mean there were...


485
0:23:28,306 --> 0:23:29,841
PAUL: Who's that?
DAVE: How many boats there?


486
0:23:29,841 --> 0:23:31,309
DAVE'S FRIEND: There's
a lot of boats.


487
0:23:31,309 --> 0:23:34,479
DAVE: Just the one bite there
and everybody else seen 'em too


488
0:23:34,479 --> 0:23:35,847
you're talking to?


489
0:23:35,847 --> 0:23:38,282
DAVE'S FRIEND: Everybody that's
out in the area's seeing 'em.


490
0:23:38,282 --> 0:23:42,453
DAVE: Alright, keep me posted.
My phone's working too.


491
0:23:42,453 --> 0:23:47,925
Just got a call from my friend
who's about four miles away and


492
0:23:47,925 --> 0:23:49,494
he's marking them
up pretty good.


493
0:23:49,494 --> 0:23:51,229
He's been there
most of the morning and


494
0:23:51,229 --> 0:23:53,397
he's had them under the boat
nonstop. What to do?


495
0:23:53,397 --> 0:24:6,77
Uh, sometimes you just gotta
go with your gut feeling.


496
0:24:6,77 --> 0:24:7,11
BILL: Dave, come in?


497
0:24:7,11 --> 0:24:8,479
PAUL: Yeah, he's going.
He's going.


498
0:24:8,479 --> 0:24:12,517
I think he's going up to
the radio now or something.


499
0:24:12,517 --> 0:24:14,285
BILL: We saw Dave, uh,
picking up his anchor and


500
0:24:14,285 --> 0:24:15,62
getting ready to move.


501
0:24:15,62 --> 0:24:17,321
I said to the crew we gotta go.


502
0:24:17,321 --> 0:24:20,224
He could get on the radio
and say hey, it looks good,


503
0:24:20,224 --> 0:24:23,528
and we're going, but
we don't get that call.


504
0:24:23,528 --> 0:24:25,229
If Dave is gonna beat
me to another fish,


505
0:24:25,229 --> 0:24:34,906
it's gonna be over my dead body.


506
0:24:34,906 --> 0:24:36,707
We're out for a while, and we
got some information on the


507
0:24:36,707 --> 0:24:39,21
radio, and then we saw Dave
uh, picking up his anchor and


508
0:24:39,21 --> 0:24:40,411
getting ready to move.


509
0:24:40,411 --> 0:24:45,82
I said to the crew, we gotta go.


510
0:24:45,82 --> 0:24:57,361
PAUL: We see you, Dave.
We're right behind you.


511
0:24:57,361 --> 0:25:6,103
Yeah.. Nice. Holy BLEEP, dude.
That's insane.


512
0:25:6,103 --> 0:25:9,774
DAVE: Now let it go.


513
0:25:9,774 --> 0:25:11,742
SCOTT: You can BLEEP run,
but you can't hide from me.


514
0:25:11,742 --> 0:25:13,978
BILL: Dave, you may have had a
great season up to this point,


515
0:25:13,978 --> 0:25:16,614
but things are gonna change.


516
0:25:16,614 --> 0:25:18,583
DAVE: I'm an amazing fisherman,
and we're gonna do it again and


517
0:25:18,583 --> 0:25:20,217
remember I said that.


518
0:25:20,217 --> 0:25:22,153
PAUL: After the way Dave
treated me, this is BLEEP war,


519
0:25:22,153 --> 0:25:29,627
bitch.


520
0:25:29,627 --> 0:25:31,195
DAVE: We got friends
already, you see them?


521
0:25:31,195 --> 0:25:32,296
SANDRO: Yep.


522
0:25:32,296 --> 0:25:36,334
PAUL: I like the 80 inchers,
fish. I love them.


523
0:25:36,334 --> 0:25:39,503
BILL: If there any tuna, we're
gonna be the ones that get them,


524
0:25:39,503 --> 0:25:41,672
and not Dave.


525
0:25:41,672 --> 0:25:43,774
DAVE'S FRIEND: INDISTINCT DAVE:
See any more?


526
0:25:43,774 --> 0:25:47,345
DAVE'S FRIEND: Nope.


527
0:25:47,345 --> 0:25:51,749
DAVE: Well, alright. Still
haven't seen my first one.


528
0:25:51,749 --> 0:25:56,42
DAVE'S FRIEND: Are you
where you were yesterday?


529
0:25:56,42 --> 0:25:57,655
DAVE: Nah, up from you.


530
0:25:57,655 --> 0:26:0,358
We've had an amazing season,
we're gonna catch one,


531
0:26:0,358 --> 0:26:2,727
but I don't think
Bill and Paul are.


532
0:26:2,727 --> 0:26:6,23
BLEEP Paul.
He's dead to me.


533
0:26:6,23 --> 0:26:7,365
Let's put one in the boat today.


534
0:26:7,365 --> 0:26:10,34
SANDRO: Sure. We'll get it
done here.


535
0:26:10,34 --> 0:26:11,702
DAVE: I know we made a
lot of money for the year.


536
0:26:11,702 --> 0:26:13,4
SANDRO: Oh yeah.


537
0:26:13,4 --> 0:26:18,442
DAVE: But, regardless, I want
to make money for the trip.


538
0:26:18,442 --> 0:26:22,113
We're gonna get him right here.


539
0:26:22,113 --> 0:26:23,18
SANDRO: Yep. Oh yeah.


540
0:26:23,18 --> 0:26:28,419
BLEEP me. BLEEP we're
already marking them.


541
0:26:28,419 --> 0:26:30,554
DAVE: Holy BLEEP. Let's go.
BLEEP Start throwing.


542
0:26:30,554 --> 0:26:34,125
Oh, he's BLEEP
right here, dude.


543
0:26:34,125 --> 0:26:46,337
I'm just throwing right here.


544
0:26:46,337 --> 0:26:49,173
PAUL: I'm feeling the pressure,
I really want to help Billy.


545
0:26:49,173 --> 0:26:53,177
How nice would it be to have
Dave watch us pull a fish out


546
0:26:53,177 --> 0:26:55,446
from underneath him?


547
0:26:55,446 --> 0:26:59,83
Scotty's gonna yell at him, "Get
the BLEEP out of my ocean."


548
0:26:59,83 --> 0:27:2,486
BILL: That's right.
PAUL: Oh, I love it.


549
0:27:2,486 --> 0:27:3,954
BILL: You don't need to be
right BLEEP next to me.


550
0:27:3,954 --> 0:27:8,693
PAUL: No. No.
BILL: You don't.


551
0:27:8,693 --> 0:27:17,635
PAUL: You wanna
yell at somebody?


552
0:27:17,635 --> 0:27:20,271
DAVE: Good start, looks
like he's eating too.


553
0:27:20,271 --> 0:27:21,338
I'm gonna hook him up hopefully.


554
0:27:21,338 --> 0:27:23,74
SANDRO: Oh yeah.


555
0:27:23,74 --> 0:27:25,376
DAVE: Man, what a
blessing this would be.


556
0:27:25,376 --> 0:27:27,244
Keep it in the
chum line, alright?


557
0:27:27,244 --> 0:27:29,113
SANDRO: Yep. I'm feeling lucky.


558
0:27:29,113 --> 0:27:32,683
DAVE: He's out here, that
thing's gonna pop.


559
0:27:32,683 --> 0:27:33,984
BILL: With all the
bait that's over there,


560
0:27:33,984 --> 0:27:50,367
you would think the tuna fish
would be piled up over there.


561
0:27:50,367 --> 0:27:53,437
PAUL: Oh, oh, oh, here we go,
here we go.


562
0:27:53,437 --> 0:27:56,474
I just BLEEP did it.
Start the boat, baby.


563
0:27:56,474 --> 0:27:58,943
BILL: No, I'm trying to get...


564
0:27:58,943 --> 0:28:0,878
PAUL: Start the boat.
Gotta turn us.


565
0:28:0,878 --> 0:28:3,547
BILL: Where is he?


566
0:28:3,547 --> 0:28:8,652
PAUL: Turning to the right.
Got to let the anchor go.


567
0:28:8,652 --> 0:28:15,292
Pull forward, Bill. You're good.
Back up real slow, Bill.


568
0:28:15,292 --> 0:28:18,129
BILL: Holy BLEEP You're
out on the gaff line now.


569
0:28:18,129 --> 0:28:20,498
PAUL: That's alright,
nice and easy. Take your time.


570
0:28:20,498 --> 0:28:23,367
BILL: Hooked up tight. Real
tight.


571
0:28:23,367 --> 0:28:29,907
PAUL: Neutral.
BILL: Feels good.


572
0:28:29,907 --> 0:28:36,46
DAVE: Wow. Not a good sign.


573
0:28:36,46 --> 0:28:38,749
SCOTT: I want to catch
a giant bluefin tuna.


574
0:28:38,749 --> 0:28:40,885
PAUL: Well, let's hope
we do good, that's all.


575
0:28:40,885 --> 0:28:52,997
It's a good feeling
to feel a fish.


576
0:28:52,997 --> 0:28:56,801
This is what I live for.


577
0:28:56,801 --> 0:28:59,36
See I'm just taking
it easy with him.


578
0:28:59,36 --> 0:29:0,504
Let that hook get in there.
You know.


579
0:29:0,504 --> 0:29:2,74
BILL: He's coming around.
PAUL: He's far away.


580
0:29:2,74 --> 0:29:6,177
SCOTT: He's a nice fish.
Nice fish. Live cod, nice.


581
0:29:6,177 --> 0:29:10,8
BILL: He's pulling us around.
Let him pull us around that way.


582
0:29:10,8 --> 0:29:11,315
He'll get tired.


583
0:29:11,315 --> 0:29:13,918
SCOTT: It's a big fish. We'll
get him. We'll get him.


584
0:29:13,918 --> 0:29:18,55
Big fish. Let's go.


585
0:29:18,55 --> 0:29:21,458
PAUL: Keep coming, Bill. Come
on. Keep up. Turn to the right.


586
0:29:21,458 --> 0:29:24,61
SCOTT: Come on, Billy. Don't
let him get him to the side,


587
0:29:24,61 --> 0:29:26,463
that's how we lost the last one.


588
0:29:26,463 --> 0:29:36,273
PAUL: Back up. Back up. Back
up. Back up.


589
0:29:36,273 --> 0:29:43,113
Back up. There you
go, neutral. Coming at us, Bill.


590
0:29:43,113 --> 0:29:45,316
Coming up. He's right there.
I see him.


591
0:29:45,316 --> 0:29:50,821
Be ready with that harpoon.
He's 100 feet down now.


592
0:29:50,821 --> 0:29:53,457
Come on up you. Neutral, Bill.


593
0:29:53,457 --> 0:29:57,328
Come back, man, come on, man.
Keep on your toes, Billy.


594
0:29:57,328 --> 0:30:0,598
BILL: Yep.
SCOTT: I see color.


595
0:30:0,598 --> 0:30:3,868
PAUL: Come on. Come on, let's
go. Get on this BLEEP.


596
0:30:3,868 --> 0:30:5,102
BILL: Right there.


597
0:30:5,102 --> 0:30:7,404
PAUL: Get on him. Alright,
now go, now go forward hard.


598
0:30:7,404 --> 0:30:10,74
The other way.


599
0:30:10,74 --> 0:30:11,208
SCOTT Forward.


600
0:30:11,208 --> 0:30:12,509
PAUL: Oh, where
you going, buddy?


601
0:30:12,509 --> 0:30:16,58
Go, Billy. Go.
Now back up.


602
0:30:16,58 --> 0:30:18,782
Back up hard.
Do that BLEEP.


603
0:30:18,782 --> 0:30:21,585
Now forward, come
on, Bill, Billy.


604
0:30:21,585 --> 0:30:26,924
SCOTT: Forward, forward hard.
Hard.


605
0:30:26,924 --> 0:30:36,166
PAUL: Back up hard, hard. BLEEP
Get him. Aww.


606
0:30:36,166 --> 0:30:37,668
Back up. Back up.
Push it in.


607
0:30:37,668 --> 0:30:38,769
BILL: Back up?


608
0:30:38,769 --> 0:30:40,304
PAUL: Push. Push.
Don't hold too tight


609
0:30:40,304 --> 0:30:41,872
SCOTT: I'm not gonna hold it.


610
0:30:41,872 --> 0:30:43,908
PAUL: Tail rope. 'Cause you
don't have BLEEP till you tail


611
0:30:43,908 --> 0:30:45,442
rope him. You don't have him
until he's wrapped up.


612
0:30:45,442 --> 0:30:47,912
Go forward this way.
Alright, you're good.


613
0:30:47,912 --> 0:30:49,313
You're good.
A gaff, you got a gaff?


614
0:30:49,313 --> 0:30:53,584
BILL: Yep.
SCOTT: Here you go.


615
0:30:53,584 --> 0:30:54,818
PAUL: Okay. Keep going
forward, Billy.


616
0:30:54,818 --> 0:30:55,719
SCOTT: Forward.


617
0:30:55,719 --> 0:30:57,788
PAUL: Alright, I got him.
Tail rope.


618
0:30:57,788 --> 0:31:2,259
He's big. Billy got one.
Billy got one, yeah. Oh yeah.


619
0:31:2,259 --> 0:31:12,269
Alright,
Billy, alright, Billy. Wooo.


620
0:31:12,269 --> 0:31:14,538
SCOTT: Yeah.
PAUL: It's been a while, huh?


621
0:31:14,538 --> 0:31:17,541
SCOTT: Good job.


622
0:31:17,541 --> 0:31:20,44
PAUL: He's beautiful. He's so
pretty. good today.


623
0:31:20,44 --> 0:31:21,278
SCOTT: Good job.


624
0:31:21,278 --> 0:31:23,18
PAUL: Look how green he is,
Bill. Come here, you guys.


625
0:31:23,18 --> 0:31:24,515
BILL: Hold on, buddy.


626
0:31:24,515 --> 0:31:26,15
PAUL: We did it. We broke the
ice. We BLEEP did good today.


627
0:31:26,15 --> 0:31:27,651
SCOTT: Ah, BLEEP Awesome. BILL:
Good job, Paulie.


628
0:31:27,651 --> 0:31:29,32
PAUL: Good job everybody.


629
0:31:29,32 --> 0:31:31,21
It was just like he won the
World Series or something.


630
0:31:31,21 --> 0:31:43,934
I was happy for him.
He was so happy.


631
0:31:43,934 --> 0:31:47,404
SCOTT: I feel outstanding.
Thanks, Paulie.


632
0:31:47,404 --> 0:31:50,507
BILL: Paul really
proved something today,


633
0:31:50,507 --> 0:31:53,377
he's a hell of a mate, and
an unbelievable fisherman.


634
0:31:53,377 --> 0:31:56,613
And he's welcome on the
Bounty Hunter any time.


635
0:31:56,613 --> 0:31:58,849
SCOTT: I feel so good
I can't even tell you.


636
0:31:58,849 --> 0:32:4,722
That's why we bring in a ringer.
Paulie.


637
0:32:4,722 --> 0:32:6,623
PAUL: Billy was so happy.


638
0:32:6,623 --> 0:32:11,595
I got happy watching how
BLEEP happy he was.


639
0:32:11,595 --> 0:32:14,832
I never seen someone so happy.
It was awesome.


640
0:32:14,832 --> 0:32:33,617
SCOTT: That's why you do this.
Right there. Mr. Tuna Fish.


641
0:32:33,617 --> 0:32:34,985
DAVE: Sandro.
SANDRO: Yeah.


642
0:32:34,985 --> 0:32:36,487
DAVE: Get out of here
in a couple minutes?


643
0:32:36,487 --> 0:32:38,889
SANDRO: Uh, yep. Let me clean
this first.


644
0:32:38,889 --> 0:32:43,227
DAVE: Alright, finish that. Just
throw whatever out you don't


645
0:32:43,227 --> 0:32:44,762
think we need, and let's get out
of here.


646
0:32:44,762 --> 0:32:47,564
There's no worse feeling heading
home empty handed when you know


647
0:32:47,564 --> 0:32:49,666
other boats have caught
fish and you didn't.


648
0:32:49,666 --> 0:32:51,802
Good for Billy, I guess the
sun shines on the dog's


649
0:32:51,802 --> 0:32:52,803
ass some days.


650
0:32:52,803 --> 0:32:54,838
That was an absolutely
horrible BLEEP day.


651
0:32:54,838 --> 0:32:58,8
Was that not the worst day of
fishing this whole entire year?


652
0:32:58,8 --> 0:32:59,41
SANDRO: Dude, that was
definitely BLEEP.


653
0:32:59,41 --> 0:33:3,28
DAVE: You think so?
SANDRO: Uh, yeah.


654
0:33:3,28 --> 0:33:6,65
DAVE: Bill and them better
enjoy the moment while it lasts,


655
0:33:6,65 --> 0:33:9,53
because we'll be back
on top again tomorrow.


656
0:33:9,53 --> 0:33:22,99
I did not have a
good time today.


657
0:33:22,99 --> 0:33:25,202
PIRATE: Scorpion walks down,
down to the edge of the creek


658
0:33:25,202 --> 0:33:27,337
and there's a frog
sitting there.


659
0:33:27,337 --> 0:33:29,673
Scorpion asks the frog,
Will you give me a ride,


660
0:33:29,673 --> 0:33:30,908
a ride across the creek?


661
0:33:30,908 --> 0:33:33,277
The frog says, "Yeah, okay,
but you can't sting me.


662
0:33:33,277 --> 0:33:35,879
The scorpion says, Okay,
I won't sting you.


663
0:33:35,879 --> 0:33:38,182
So then the frog says, Are you
sure you're not gonna sting me?


664
0:33:38,182 --> 0:33:41,452
The scorpion replies,
No, I won't sting you.


665
0:33:41,452 --> 0:33:44,721
So, the frog backs up and
the scorpion gets on there.


666
0:33:44,721 --> 0:33:46,623
Just about halfway in
the middle of the creek,


667
0:33:46,623 --> 0:33:49,59
the scorpion stings the frog.


668
0:33:49,59 --> 0:33:53,63
The frog's about ready to die,
he says, "Why'd you sting me?"


669
0:33:53,63 --> 0:33:57,34
"'Cause I'm scorpion."


670
0:33:57,34 --> 0:34:7,344
So the moral to that story is, I
been still waiting to find out.


671
0:34:7,344 --> 0:34:9,279
RALPH: Yeah, when you're not
catching, it gets to be


672
0:34:9,279 --> 0:34:11,181
a lot of tension in the
air between the two of yous.


673
0:34:11,181 --> 0:34:12,616
And there's only
one fix to that,


674
0:34:12,616 --> 0:34:14,485
and that's to get tight
and catch tuna fish.


675
0:34:14,485 --> 0:34:15,686
Alright, what do we got here?


676
0:34:15,686 --> 0:34:17,588
We got a mark at 50.


677
0:34:17,588 --> 0:34:19,59
What are we gonna
do with him now? 60.


678
0:34:19,59 --> 0:34:23,36
He's right on the down bait.
That's where the down line is.


679
0:34:23,36 --> 0:34:27,297
And this fleck in front
of him is the mackerel.


680
0:34:27,297 --> 0:34:38,575
See this is the mackerel. Right
here. And that's the tuna fish.


681
0:34:38,575 --> 0:34:39,776
PIRATE: Fish on. Fish on. Fish
on, Cap.


682
0:34:39,776 --> 0:34:41,745
It's on. It's on.
It's on cap.


683
0:34:41,745 --> 0:34:45,149
RALPH: Alright, get
the other lines in,


684
0:34:45,149 --> 0:34:52,523
get the other lines in.


685
0:34:52,523 --> 0:34:55,659
Ah, he's off, he's off.
He's off.


686
0:34:55,659 --> 0:34:58,529
He's gone, God damn it.


687
0:34:58,529 --> 0:35:2,866
PIRATE: We just had a fish
and, ah, something went wrong.


688
0:35:2,866 --> 0:35:5,169
That's all I know,
to my knowledge.


689
0:35:5,169 --> 0:35:8,5
RALPH: Nice BLEEP job
you got here, Mr. Pirate.


690
0:35:8,5 --> 0:35:11,642
When Pirate got a big tangle,
one of the lines got scraped on


691
0:35:11,642 --> 0:35:12,976
the keel of the boat.


692
0:35:12,976 --> 0:35:17,181
Pirate reeled it in, it went
undetected and the next day of


693
0:35:17,181 --> 0:35:20,584
course, that rod got a
giant tuna on it and


694
0:35:20,584 --> 0:35:24,254
we busted him off.


695
0:35:24,254 --> 0:35:26,356
Now we have to BLEEP catch
another one I guess.


696
0:35:26,356 --> 0:35:29,526
It's just like in any sports
event, when you make an error


697
0:35:29,526 --> 0:35:33,3
you give the opposition
a chance to win.


698
0:35:33,3 --> 0:35:36,567
If you mess up and the
line gets scored and


699
0:35:36,567 --> 0:35:38,835
you don't detect it on
the day it happens,


700
0:35:38,835 --> 0:35:41,171
it's gonna come back and bite
you in the ass.


701
0:35:41,171 --> 0:35:43,173
Yeah, everybody makes
mistakes one or twice,


702
0:35:43,173 --> 0:35:45,409
but when you're making the same
mistakes day in and day out,


703
0:35:45,409 --> 0:35:56,32
it gets to a point where
it's very frustrating.


704
0:35:56,32 --> 0:35:57,487
PIRATE: One of the
lines is going underneath


705
0:35:57,487 --> 0:36:3,26
the boat right now.


706
0:36:3,26 --> 0:36:5,762
RALPH: BLEEP stuck
under the boat again.


707
0:36:5,762 --> 0:36:7,898
Picking tangles out of the
BLEEP propeller is not


708
0:36:7,898 --> 0:36:9,299
entertaining to me.


709
0:36:9,299 --> 0:36:13,303
And you, before it gets to
this point, you're the deckman.


710
0:36:13,303 --> 0:36:15,439
So much of this I
can put up with.


711
0:36:15,439 --> 0:36:17,541
PIRATE: Sometimes I get upset
because I don't think Captain


712
0:36:17,541 --> 0:36:18,909
Ralph respects me.


713
0:36:18,909 --> 0:36:21,178
And I don't like the
way he treats me when


714
0:36:21,178 --> 0:36:22,946
we're not catching fish.


715
0:36:22,946 --> 0:36:26,583
RALPH: BLEEP joke.


716
0:36:26,583 --> 0:36:28,785
PIRATE: You can only get so
much tough love thrown your way


717
0:36:28,785 --> 0:36:31,488
before enough's enough.


718
0:36:31,488 --> 0:36:33,991
RALPH: Put that line to
the back of the boat.


719
0:36:33,991 --> 0:36:35,459
PIRATE: The yellow one, right?


720
0:36:35,459 --> 0:36:44,1
RALPH: Put that one to
the back of the boat.


721
0:36:44,1 --> 0:36:45,836
No, the yellow
one, the other one.


722
0:36:45,836 --> 0:36:53,777
PIRATE: It's bobbing up
and down, it's right here.


723
0:36:53,777 --> 0:37:11,528
Every man has a breaking point,
and I think I just reached mine.


724
0:37:11,528 --> 0:37:14,131
MARCIANO: You know, some people
collect stamps.


725
0:37:14,131 --> 0:37:16,6
Some people collect antiques.


726
0:37:16,6 --> 0:37:22,339
Jay and I, we collect the
tails of giant bluefin tuna.


727
0:37:22,339 --> 0:37:24,508
Stand on the barrel and
fill in that window now.


728
0:37:24,508 --> 0:37:26,41
Be brave for crying out loud.


729
0:37:26,41 --> 0:37:30,514
Whenever we get a fish,
especially a nice one, we have


730
0:37:30,514 --> 0:37:37,187
a ritual, and that's nailing
those tails up on the wall.


731
0:37:37,187 --> 0:37:38,955
Get up there higher though.


732
0:37:38,955 --> 0:37:42,292
There you go.Every tail
up there tells a story.


733
0:37:42,292 --> 0:37:44,294
JAY: Remember this one, Dave?


734
0:37:44,294 --> 0:37:46,29
MARCIANO: Yeah, I
remember that one.


735
0:37:46,29 --> 0:37:48,231
That's basically
our trophy wall.


736
0:37:48,231 --> 0:37:51,134
That's where we get to
show how good we are.


737
0:37:51,134 --> 0:37:54,504
Shows the other guys who's
catching and who's not.


738
0:37:54,504 --> 0:38:9,319
Alright, Jay, what can I
say, you nailed it, man.


739
0:38:9,319 --> 0:38:12,489
PAUL: Here you go, the
monkey is off your back.


740
0:38:12,489 --> 0:38:16,76
Ta da da da.


741
0:38:16,76 --> 0:38:19,796
BILL: We got an extra
passenger on board and uhm,


742
0:38:19,796 --> 0:38:22,65
he's a good size one.


743
0:38:22,65 --> 0:38:26,436
And hopefully he'll do well.


744
0:38:26,436 --> 0:38:29,74
DONNA: Yippee. Yippee.
Yippee. Yippee.


745
0:38:29,74 --> 0:38:32,42
Standing out on the dock,
waiting for him to come around


746
0:38:32,42 --> 0:38:37,948
the corner, and I couldn't be
happier. Woohooohoo.


747
0:38:37,948 --> 0:38:40,384
I couldn't wait to throw
my arms around Bill and


748
0:38:40,384 --> 0:38:42,953
say yes, we did it.


749
0:38:42,953 --> 0:38:45,689
Finally.
About freaking time.


750
0:38:45,689 --> 0:38:47,391
MAN: Way to go,
guys, way to go.


751
0:38:47,391 --> 0:38:50,93
DONNA: Yo, Paulie.


752
0:38:50,93 --> 0:38:52,295
PAUL: It was good,
it was a good day.


753
0:38:52,295 --> 0:38:55,98
Put a couple lines out, hung
out, had a soda, had a sandwich,


754
0:38:55,98 --> 0:38:57,968
and BLEEP hooked up.


755
0:38:57,968 --> 0:38:59,403
SCOTT: I'm really
excited right now.


756
0:38:59,403 --> 0:39:1,271
We got a big monkey
off our back today.


757
0:39:1,271 --> 0:39:5,41
This fish meant a lot to us, the
Bounty Hunter, the team here.


758
0:39:5,41 --> 0:39:6,376
We didn't have bad luck,
we wouldn't've had any


759
0:39:6,376 --> 0:39:7,577
luck this year.


760
0:39:7,577 --> 0:39:10,48
So, this meant a lot.
It's a phenomenal feeling.


761
0:39:10,48 --> 0:39:11,815
I really can't describe it.


762
0:39:11,815 --> 0:39:13,784
Until you experience it, you
don't know what I'm really


763
0:39:13,784 --> 0:39:16,42
talking about, but people who
are adrenaline junkies know what


764
0:39:16,42 --> 0:39:20,29
it is, and, ah, it's
phenomenal feeling.


765
0:39:20,29 --> 0:39:28,532
DONNA: Woo hoo. Finally,
finally, finally. Awesome.


766
0:39:28,532 --> 0:39:32,969
SCOTT: What's up, man?
DONNA: Good job, Scott.


767
0:39:32,969 --> 0:39:34,805
BILL: Yeah. Donna was pretty
excited when I called her at


768
0:39:34,805 --> 0:39:37,14
work and told her that we had
got one and, you know,


769
0:39:37,14 --> 0:39:42,846
I wish she was on the
boat but she's excited.


770
0:39:42,846 --> 0:39:44,8
MAN: Weight on there
right now as it stands.


771
0:39:44,8 --> 0:39:47,484
MAN #2: Come on. 503.
PAUL: Nice.


772
0:39:47,484 --> 0:39:49,719
MAN: 503 pounds.


773
0:39:49,719 --> 0:39:51,388
BILL: Anytime you catch one
it makes everything good.


774
0:39:51,388 --> 0:39:52,722
It's a tough battle.


775
0:39:52,722 --> 0:39:55,25
You can be the luckiest person
in the world and catch one all


776
0:39:55,25 --> 0:39:57,594
the time, or you can put the
boat in the wrong place all the


777
0:39:57,594 --> 0:39:59,796
time and never catch one.


778
0:39:59,796 --> 0:40:1,364
So that's the way it works.


779
0:40:1,364 --> 0:40:3,3
PAUL: You know what I mean?
That'd be sweet.


780
0:40:3,3 --> 0:40:6,436
DONNA: Good job, Paul.
PAUL: Lucky.


781
0:40:6,436 --> 0:40:8,738
DONNA: Good going.


782
0:40:8,738 --> 0:40:11,107
SCOTT: I can't speak more
highly of Paul of anybody


783
0:40:11,107 --> 0:40:12,576
I've ever fished with.


784
0:40:12,576 --> 0:40:14,778
He is just a mad dog fisherman.


785
0:40:14,778 --> 0:40:18,482
What he really brought to the
boat was a kick ass attitude,


786
0:40:18,482 --> 0:40:20,517
which I think we really needed.


787
0:40:20,517 --> 0:40:22,886
BILL: Paul fishes very
hard, he makes it happen.


788
0:40:22,886 --> 0:40:27,9
And uh, today it paid off.
No doubt about it.


789
0:40:27,9 --> 0:40:31,261
Billy really needed that fish.
Bad.


790
0:40:31,261 --> 0:40:34,564
I'm glad I jumped on with him.
Attitude's totally different.


791
0:40:34,564 --> 0:40:39,436
Very peaceful, very relaxed.
It's just comfortable.


792
0:40:39,436 --> 0:40:44,374
You know, it feels like
I'm in my own home.


793
0:40:44,374 --> 0:40:49,112
MAN: 96 inches, eight foot.
That's got great color, boys.


794
0:40:49,112 --> 0:40:50,68
PAUL: Yeah.
MAN #2: Yeah.


795
0:40:50,68 --> 0:40:55,151
MAN: That's got very nice color.
Just doing a core sample here.


796
0:40:55,151 --> 0:41:0,223
We're looking at the clarity of
the inside color to make sure


797
0:41:0,223 --> 0:41:3,593
there's not any
cloudiness or brown meat.


798
0:41:3,593 --> 0:41:6,329
Nice. Nice. Nice.


799
0:41:6,329 --> 0:41:9,533
It's a very clean
inside color and it's,


800
0:41:9,533 --> 0:41:12,269
it's got very nice
fat, very good texture.


801
0:41:12,269 --> 0:41:13,603
BILL: How good's the market?


802
0:41:13,603 --> 0:41:15,338
MAN: This should
do pretty well.


803
0:41:15,338 --> 0:41:18,174
It's a good size fish,
it's not overly huge.


804
0:41:18,174 --> 0:41:21,278
I hope it does at
least 15 bucks a pound.


805
0:41:21,278 --> 0:41:25,615
SCOTT: Bill Monte.
BILL: Yeah.


806
0:41:25,615 --> 0:41:26,683
DONNA: Yeah.


807
0:41:26,683 --> 0:41:27,751
BILL: Sometimes you have
to make your own luck,


808
0:41:27,751 --> 0:41:29,319
the one thing you can't
do is stop fishing.


809
0:41:29,319 --> 0:41:31,221
You can't give up.
You have to keep fishing.


810
0:41:31,221 --> 0:41:34,291
That's the way it is.
Hey, Dave, suck it.


811
0:41:34,291 --> 0:41:41,31
Bounty Hunter's
back in business.


812
0:41:41,31 --> 0:41:50,4
PAUL: See you, buddy.


813
0:41:50,4 --> 0:41:52,742
RALPH: Alright, we're down
here today without Pirate,


814
0:41:52,742 --> 0:41:55,545
he failed to show up, so
because of that behavior


815
0:41:55,545 --> 0:41:57,48
we've suspended
him from fishing.


816
0:41:57,48 --> 0:41:59,616
So, whatever
Pirate's problem is,


817
0:41:59,616 --> 0:42:2,352
it continues to be his problem.


818
0:42:2,352 --> 0:42:4,354
He's got a lot to learn, he
missed on a good,


819
0:42:4,354 --> 0:42:5,622
good thing here.


820
0:42:5,622 --> 0:42:7,524
So, we're gonna go
back to fishing solo.


821
0:42:7,524 --> 0:42:10,727
It's the work, twice the
risk, but twice the money,


822
0:42:10,727 --> 0:42:15,665
so let's go get the money.


823
0:42:15,665 --> 0:42:17,367
PIRATE: This morning,
my gut was turning,


824
0:42:17,367 --> 0:42:20,203
I was trying to figure out
what, what the next step was.


825
0:42:20,203 --> 0:42:23,73
I tell him this, he
throws something at me,


826
0:42:23,73 --> 0:42:25,108
if I tell him this, he
throws something else at me,


827
0:42:25,108 --> 0:42:27,243
I'm caught between a
rock and a hard place.


828
0:42:27,243 --> 0:42:29,879
I don't know what to do.


829
0:42:29,879 --> 0:42:31,114
I know it's probably tough love
what he's trying to do for me,


830
0:42:31,114 --> 0:42:33,283
but I need some down time too.


831
0:42:33,283 --> 0:42:35,719
And, that's what it is,
is what it is right now.


832
0:42:35,719 --> 0:42:40,19
So I don't know.


833
0:42:40,19 --> 0:42:42,158
RALPH: You know, he just waits
for me to soften up and I take


834
0:42:42,158 --> 0:42:45,295
him back, but, you know,
this stage in the season,


835
0:42:45,295 --> 0:42:50,233
all he did was lose his
winter work because you know,


836
0:42:50,233 --> 0:42:53,536
fishing's gonna be just about
over soon and I got no problem


837
0:42:53,536 --> 0:42:55,171
handling the boat myself.


838
0:42:55,171 --> 0:42:57,641
I did it for five years. So.


839
0:42:57,641 --> 0:43:10,987
PIRATE: Oh my god.


840
0:43:10,987 --> 0:43:12,856
I'm down here this morning to
see what's gonna happen,


841
0:43:12,856 --> 0:43:14,858
if we're going
fishing or not.


842
0:43:14,858 --> 0:43:16,92
We'll see what happens.


843
0:43:16,92 --> 0:43:18,294
I don't know if it's gonna
be a good thing for me to go


844
0:43:18,294 --> 0:43:20,163
apologize or what I'm gonna do.


845
0:43:20,163 --> 0:43:22,32
I'm not sure what's
gonna happen yet.


846
0:43:22,32 --> 0:43:24,834
Gotta see what's going on, if
I can get my site back or not,


847
0:43:24,834 --> 0:43:29,806
and, ah, we'll see what happens.


848
0:43:29,806 --> 0:43:31,474
RALPH: I don't want
you on my boat today.


849
0:43:31,474 --> 0:43:33,677
This is not a BLEEP game.


850
0:43:33,677 --> 0:43:35,712
BLEEP. You want to show
up with BLEEP.


851
0:43:35,712 --> 0:43:44,788
I ain't into your BLEEP.
This is my business.


852
0:43:44,788 --> 0:43:46,22
PIRATE: There you have it right
there.


853
0:43:46,22 --> 0:43:47,757
I guess that's gonna be the
end of it right there is how


854
0:43:47,757 --> 0:43:48,825
we speak.


855
0:43:48,825 --> 0:43:50,86
I'm not gonna have
nothing, no part of being.


856
0:43:50,86 --> 0:43:53,496
Evidently Captain's still
a little pissed off,


857
0:43:53,496 --> 0:43:55,265
he don't want to
take me on it, so,


858
0:43:55,265 --> 0:43:56,733
he's gonna be going
out all by himself.


859
0:43:56,733 --> 0:43:58,435
Good luck to him, I
appreciate the, ah,


860
0:43:58,435 --> 0:44:0,637
time he gave me but what I'm
gonna do now is just, ah,


861
0:44:0,637 --> 0:44:4,374
pack up and, ah, head back home.


862
0:44:4,374 --> 0:44:5,775
RALPH: Even if I could go
back in time with Pirate,


863
0:44:5,775 --> 0:44:7,41
I don't think there's
anything I would change.


864
0:44:7,41 --> 0:44:9,679
I gave the guy an
opportunity of his lifetime.


865
0:44:9,679 --> 0:44:12,582
There's people like him all over
this place that would have loved


866
0:44:12,582 --> 0:44:14,484
to have his opportunity.


867
0:44:14,484 --> 0:44:16,92
I wish Pirate a lot of good
luck and I hope someday


868
0:44:16,92 --> 0:44:19,756
he deals with his issues.


869
0:44:19,756 --> 0:46:19,756
PIRATE: I'm all done for the
season. Thanks.
