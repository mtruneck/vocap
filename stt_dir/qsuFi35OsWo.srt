[MUSIC PLAYING]


2
0:0:2,44 --> 0:0:4,435
THOMAS MORTON: Hey,
it's Thomas.


3
0:0:4,435 --> 0:0:6,93
We are in an old
shipping yard--


4
0:0:6,93 --> 0:0:8,52
the tail end of Brooklyn.


5
0:0:8,52 --> 0:0:11,46
It sort of looks like a set from
Season 2 of The Wire, but


6
0:0:11,46 --> 0:0:13,66
is actually the set
for seasons "all"


7
0:0:13,66 --> 0:0:14,97
of Boardwalk Empire.


8
0:0:14,97 --> 0:0:18,56



9
0:0:18,56 --> 0:0:21,38
We're going to meet the show's
creator, and a main director,


10
0:0:21,38 --> 0:0:21,85
main writer--


11
0:0:21,85 --> 0:0:23,3
Terence Winter.


12
0:0:23,3 --> 0:0:26,62
He came up writing spec
scripts in early '90s


13
0:0:26,62 --> 0:0:30,68
Hollywood for such classy fare
as Sister, Sister and Xena:


14
0:0:30,68 --> 0:0:32,99
Warrior Princess.


15
0:0:32,99 --> 0:0:36,45
Then he became one of the main
staff writers on The Sopranos


16
0:0:36,45 --> 0:0:41,315
and created this thing
with Martin Scorsese.


17
0:0:41,315 --> 0:0:48,732



18
0:0:48,732 --> 0:0:49,795
THOMAS MORTON: Hi.


19
0:0:49,795 --> 0:0:50,47
TERENCE WINTER: Hi.


20
0:0:50,47 --> 0:0:53,38
THOMAS MORTON: Thank you
for taking us out here.


21
0:0:53,38 --> 0:0:55,63
What's going on today?--
some sort of glue?


22
0:0:55,63 --> 0:0:57,9
TERENCE WINTER: This
is, I guess, just


23
0:0:57,9 --> 0:1:0,18
touch up on the boardwalk.


24
0:1:0,18 --> 0:1:3,88
These boards are actually
weathered.


25
0:1:3,88 --> 0:1:5,45
I mean, Atlantic City is
actually right on the ocean,


26
0:1:5,45 --> 0:1:6,37
so the whole place
is weathered.


27
0:1:6,37 --> 0:1:8,715
Actually, when we built this,
even when it was brand-new, we


28
0:1:8,715 --> 0:1:10,92
had to weather down the
boardwalk to make it look like


29
0:1:10,92 --> 0:1:13,64
it wasn't new, because it's
supposed to be the real thing.


30
0:1:13,64 --> 0:1:16,628



31
0:1:16,628 --> 0:1:18,56
THOMAS MORTON: I wanted to ask
you because it's something


32
0:1:18,56 --> 0:1:22,99
that's always kind of both
inspired and terrified me


33
0:1:22,99 --> 0:1:25,76
about your history, is the
switching to screenwriting


34
0:1:25,76 --> 0:1:29,46
when you were almost 30, which
is where I'm almost at.


35
0:1:29,46 --> 0:1:31,22
Because you were in law, and you
did a bunch of other stuff


36
0:1:31,22 --> 0:1:31,72
before that.


37
0:1:31,72 --> 0:1:33,82
And you're from Brooklyn.


38
0:1:33,82 --> 0:1:36,83
Was the writing thing something
you did on the side


39
0:1:36,83 --> 0:1:40,54
and slowly simmered until you
couldn't take it, or was there


40
0:1:40,54 --> 0:1:43,36
some sort of snap moment where
you kind of realized your--


41
0:1:43,36 --> 0:1:44,55
TERENCE WINTER: It simmered.


42
0:1:44,55 --> 0:1:45,73
I didn't do it on the side.


43
0:1:45,73 --> 0:1:48,4
I hadn't written a script until
I already decided to


44
0:1:48,4 --> 0:1:52,9
quit everything and just go
and fully commit to that.


45
0:1:52,9 --> 0:1:54,89
My ambition as a kid was really
relegated to, I wanted


46
0:1:54,89 --> 0:1:58,87
to make money, and by the time
I grew up a little bit, the


47
0:1:58,87 --> 0:2:1,51
only two jobs that I was really
focused on that I knew


48
0:2:1,51 --> 0:2:3,37
made a lot of money, or at least
I thought, were doctor


49
0:2:3,37 --> 0:2:4,19
and lawyer.


50
0:2:4,19 --> 0:2:6,59
So lawyer seemed feasible
because I was a pretty good


51
0:2:6,59 --> 0:2:7,46
bullshit artist.


52
0:2:7,46 --> 0:2:10,454
And I thought, all right,
well let me do that.


53
0:2:10,454 --> 0:2:12,955
I didn't even consider whether
or not I would like it.


54
0:2:12,955 --> 0:2:15,8
It just seemed like an important
job, and I wanted to


55
0:2:15,8 --> 0:2:16,995
be important.


56
0:2:16,995 --> 0:2:19,45
And have a diploma
written in Latin.


57
0:2:19,45 --> 0:2:20,98
So I did that, and I was
really miserable.


58
0:2:20,98 --> 0:2:24,76
But all the while, I was still
a big fan of movies and TV.


59
0:2:24,76 --> 0:2:28,145
And that ambition was
sort of growing.


60
0:2:28,145 --> 0:2:30,42
THOMAS MORTON: Now, did you
ever actually learn


61
0:2:30,42 --> 0:2:33,42
screenwriting, or was it
in-built from years of


62
0:2:33,42 --> 0:2:35,57
watching television and kind
of picking up the rhythms?


63
0:2:35,57 --> 0:2:36,9
TERENCE WINTER: Yeah.


64
0:2:36,9 --> 0:2:39,55
It was mostly that--
mostly osmosis.


65
0:2:39,55 --> 0:2:41,35
And I started out
writing sitcoms.


66
0:2:41,35 --> 0:2:44,8
I watched a gazillion hours
of TV sitcoms as a kid.


67
0:2:44,8 --> 0:2:45,61
There's a station--


68
0:2:45,61 --> 0:2:46,47
WPIX--


69
0:2:46,47 --> 0:2:50,69
in New York-- channel 11 that in
the '60s and '70s just ran


70
0:2:50,69 --> 0:2:52,63
Gilligan's Island, The Munsters,
The Abbott and


71
0:2:52,63 --> 0:2:53,89
Costello Show--


72
0:2:53,89 --> 0:2:55,28
just over and over again.


73
0:2:55,28 --> 0:3:0,33
So I just soaked all that in.


74
0:3:0,33 --> 0:3:4,15
And I felt like I understood the
rhythms of a sitcom, and


75
0:3:4,15 --> 0:3:7,28
also the idea that a sitcom
sitcom script is 30 minutes


76
0:3:7,28 --> 0:3:8,57
long, 22 minutes long.


77
0:3:8,57 --> 0:3:11,71
And I thought, OK,
I can do this.


78
0:3:11,71 --> 0:3:14,42
I got to L.A. I went to
the Writers' Guild.


79
0:3:14,42 --> 0:3:16,52
I got actual physical scripts.


80
0:3:16,52 --> 0:3:18,74
I looked at how they
were formatted--


81
0:3:18,74 --> 0:3:21,35
I think, maybe read Syd Field's
screenplay book and


82
0:3:21,35 --> 0:3:23,38
just got the basics, and
then I just plunged in.


83
0:3:23,38 --> 0:3:25,36
I wrote a Doogie Howser
spec script.


84
0:3:25,36 --> 0:3:27,83
That was the first thing I
ever wrote, because I had


85
0:3:27,83 --> 0:3:29,63
heard about a guy back
in Brooklyn.


86
0:3:29,63 --> 0:3:31,96
His uncle knew a guy who was an


87
0:3:31,96 --> 0:3:33,4
electrician on Doogie Howser.


88
0:3:33,4 --> 0:3:34,5
I thought, oh, this is great.


89
0:3:34,5 --> 0:3:34,98
I'll just write a
Doogie Howser.


90
0:3:34,98 --> 0:3:37,14
I'll get it to him, and I'll
get a job on the show.


91
0:3:37,14 --> 0:3:38,39
THOMAS MORTON: Slide it under
the bathroom stall.


92
0:3:38,39 --> 0:3:38,85
TERENCE WINTER: Yeah.


93
0:3:38,85 --> 0:3:42,22
That, unfortunately, did not
happen, but that was it.


94
0:3:42,22 --> 0:3:44,18
And then I just kept doing
it from there.


95
0:3:44,18 --> 0:3:49,76
And I used to actually tape
sitcoms and dissect them.


96
0:3:49,76 --> 0:3:51,17
I'd stop and watch a scene.


97
0:3:51,17 --> 0:3:52,43
I'd write down what happened
in a scene.


98
0:3:52,43 --> 0:3:53,22
I'd watch the next scene,
and write down


99
0:3:53,22 --> 0:3:53,87
what happened in it.


100
0:3:53,87 --> 0:3:56,88
It's almost like when people say
they want to grow up to be


101
0:3:56,88 --> 0:3:59,34
an engineer, and they used to
take a radio apart and put it


102
0:3:59,34 --> 0:3:59,81
back together.


103
0:3:59,81 --> 0:4:0,88
I used to do that
with stories.


104
0:4:0,88 --> 0:4:3,71
THOMAS MORTON: When you were
writing for sitcoms, like


105
0:4:3,71 --> 0:4:6,69
Sister, Sister, and Xena, and
stuff, what were the other


106
0:4:6,69 --> 0:4:7,48
writers like there?


107
0:4:7,48 --> 0:4:10,34
I think a lot of people tend to
kind of look down on that


108
0:4:10,34 --> 0:4:14,81
stuff as pretty lowbrow,
but it takes a level of


109
0:4:14,81 --> 0:4:17,75
workmanship just to make
things that good.


110
0:4:17,75 --> 0:4:20,1
TERENCE WINTER: Early on in my
career, I wasn't planning out


111
0:4:20,1 --> 0:4:21,45
a career path.


112
0:4:21,45 --> 0:4:23,57
If you offered me a job writing,
I would say yes.


113
0:4:23,57 --> 0:4:25,56
I mean, that was my standard.


114
0:4:25,56 --> 0:4:28,4
I just was thrilled to be making
a living at this, so I


115
0:4:28,4 --> 0:4:29,57
was proud to have those jobs.


116
0:4:29,57 --> 0:4:32,95
And, look, I mean, you take a
show like Sister, Sister.


117
0:4:32,95 --> 0:4:36,7
It's a show generally written
for kids between the


118
0:4:36,7 --> 0:4:37,82
ages of 9 and 13.


119
0:4:37,82 --> 0:4:40,21
So, yeah, it's not going
to be Seinfeld.


120
0:4:40,21 --> 0:4:41,52
It's a different animal.


121
0:4:41,52 --> 0:4:44,38
And there are a lot of people
who worked on those types of


122
0:4:44,38 --> 0:4:45,39
shows for a long time--


123
0:4:45,39 --> 0:4:48,51
Full House, Family Matters.


124
0:4:48,51 --> 0:4:49,82
That's a skill set.


125
0:4:49,82 --> 0:4:52,81
And there's an audience for
that, and there's a generation


126
0:4:52,81 --> 0:4:54,64
of kids who will look back at
that and go, ah, that was my


127
0:4:54,64 --> 0:4:55,71
favorite show growing up.


128
0:4:55,71 --> 0:5:0,12
I've actually gotten more
attention from friends' kids


129
0:5:0,12 --> 0:5:2,52
for that than I have
for The Sopranos.


130
0:5:2,52 --> 0:5:4,9
They go, oh, I used
to love that show.


131
0:5:4,9 --> 0:5:8,6



132
0:5:8,6 --> 0:5:10,14
THOMAS MORTON: How did you catch
David Chase's attention?


133
0:5:10,14 --> 0:5:13,203
How did you start working
on The Sopranos?


134
0:5:13,203 --> 0:5:15,31
TERENCE WINTER: I got
pilot the episode--


135
0:5:15,31 --> 0:5:16,49
actually, the videotape.


136
0:5:16,49 --> 0:5:17,4
I'm dating myself.


137
0:5:17,4 --> 0:5:19,66
My agent sent me the tape of
the pilot of The Sopranos.


138
0:5:19,66 --> 0:5:21,35
And he said, I want you
to watch this thing.


139
0:5:21,35 --> 0:5:23,97
And I thought it was the
greatest thing I'd ever seen.


140
0:5:23,97 --> 0:5:26,13
And I'd grown up in Brooklyn--


141
0:5:26,13 --> 0:5:28,89
sort of knew people like
that in that world.


142
0:5:28,89 --> 0:5:31,22
I actually worked in a butcher's
shop that was owned,


143
0:5:31,22 --> 0:5:33,94
basically, by Paul Castellano,
who was the head of the


144
0:5:33,94 --> 0:5:35,43
Gambino family at one point.


145
0:5:35,43 --> 0:5:38,92
And I just sort of was familiar
with that terrain.


146
0:5:38,92 --> 0:5:40,38
So I called my agent and
said, you've got to


147
0:5:40,38 --> 0:5:41,33
get me on this show.


148
0:5:41,33 --> 0:5:43,76
The second call was to a guy
named Frank Renzulli, who


149
0:5:43,76 --> 0:5:45,54
co-created the first show I
ever worked on, called The


150
0:5:45,54 --> 0:5:46,72
Great Defender.


151
0:5:46,72 --> 0:5:49,385
Frank grew up in Boston in
a similar environment.


152
0:5:49,385 --> 0:5:50,5
I said, have you seen
this thing?


153
0:5:50,5 --> 0:5:51,98
He said, yeah, I'm actually
meeting with this guy David


154
0:5:51,98 --> 0:5:52,9
Chase on Friday.


155
0:5:52,9 --> 0:5:54,7
I said, you've got to get
me in there with you.


156
0:5:54,7 --> 0:5:55,41
He said, I'll do my best.


157
0:5:55,41 --> 0:5:57,85
As it turned out, Frank was the
last guy David hired for


158
0:5:57,85 --> 0:6:1,56
his season one staff, so
the door got shut down.


159
0:6:1,56 --> 0:6:3,88
So, basically, what happened
is most of the first year


160
0:6:3,88 --> 0:6:5,33
staff didn't survive.


161
0:6:5,33 --> 0:6:7,5
Frank was one of the
few people who did.


162
0:6:7,5 --> 0:6:9,12
And when it came time for Season
2, finally, David said,


163
0:6:9,12 --> 0:6:10,6
all right, who's this guy you've
been telling me about?


164
0:6:10,6 --> 0:6:12,34
And he says, it's my friend,
Terry Winter.


165
0:6:12,34 --> 0:6:13,63
I'm telling you, he can
write the show.


166
0:6:13,63 --> 0:6:14,87
Just give him a shot.


167
0:6:14,87 --> 0:6:18,21
And David did, and he gave me
an episode to write, and it


168
0:6:18,21 --> 0:6:20,3
was basically an audition.


169
0:6:20,3 --> 0:6:22,57
And the idea is if I did good,
I would get hired,


170
0:6:22,57 --> 0:6:23,69
and I guess I did.


171
0:6:23,69 --> 0:6:25,28
THOMAS MORTON: So it was yet
another spec script?


172
0:6:25,28 --> 0:6:26,4
TERENCE WINTER: Yeah,
basically.


173
0:6:26,4 --> 0:6:28,48
THOMAS MORTON: So you've got a
show you're making with Martin


174
0:6:28,48 --> 0:6:29,98
Scorsese and Mick Jagger.


175
0:6:29,98 --> 0:6:32,806
Can you tell us about that
or is it hush-hush?


176
0:6:32,806 --> 0:6:33,47
TERENCE WINTER: Yeah.


177
0:6:33,47 --> 0:6:36,2
We're developing a show that
we set in New York City in


178
0:6:36,2 --> 0:6:42,74
1973, which was the year that
disco, hip-hop, and punk rock


179
0:6:42,74 --> 0:6:45,9
sort of all were born--


180
0:6:45,9 --> 0:6:46,99
centers around the music
business, if you haven't


181
0:6:46,99 --> 0:6:47,64
guessed already.


182
0:6:47,64 --> 0:6:51,64
Basically, an A and R guy sort
of the middle of his career.


183
0:6:51,64 --> 0:6:54,65
And it was a really interesting
period, musically.


184
0:6:54,65 --> 0:6:57,3
The city was at a low
point, in terms of


185
0:6:57,3 --> 0:6:58,62
economics and crime.


186
0:6:58,62 --> 0:7:2,48
And, as is often the case,
great art is born


187
0:7:2,48 --> 0:7:4,29
of times like that.


188
0:7:4,29 --> 0:7:7,14
And it was just an amazingly
fertile time for music.


189
0:7:7,14 --> 0:7:11,19
And I'm lucky enough to be
working with Martin Scorsese


190
0:7:11,19 --> 0:7:13,53
and Mick Jagger on this,
which is just--


191
0:7:13,53 --> 0:7:17,13
these are the days when I wake
up and go, OK, I'm dreaming--


192
0:7:17,13 --> 0:7:18,87
the first time you find yourself
in a room with those


193
0:7:18,87 --> 0:7:21,265
two guys, and think,
how did I get here?


194
0:7:21,265 --> 0:7:26,36
THOMAS MORTON: How was it going
from being a writer for


195
0:7:26,36 --> 0:7:30,64
like 20 years into making
your own writing room.


196
0:7:30,64 --> 0:7:32,2
And the whole show--


197
0:7:32,2 --> 0:7:32,6
I'm sorry.


198
0:7:32,6 --> 0:7:34,14
There's a lot more
to it that that.


199
0:7:34,14 --> 0:7:37,7
But how hard of a transition
was that?


200
0:7:37,7 --> 0:7:40,18
TERENCE WINTER: It wasn't
really hard.


201
0:7:40,18 --> 0:7:42,52
I had the great good
fortune to learn at


202
0:7:42,52 --> 0:7:43,84
the feet of the master.


203
0:7:43,84 --> 0:7:49,14
David was just an incredible
manager of the entire show,


204
0:7:49,14 --> 0:7:51,18
not just the writers' room,
but the whole thing--


205
0:7:51,18 --> 0:7:54,67
and really great at putting a
crew together, and really


206
0:7:54,67 --> 0:7:56,73
mixing and matching people who
really wanted to work together


207
0:7:56,73 --> 0:8:0,68
and hang together, and we had
a really fun, happy set.


208
0:8:0,68 --> 0:8:3,38
THOMAS MORTON: Well, could we
take a look around this set?


209
0:8:3,38 --> 0:8:3,835
TERENCE WINTER: Yeah, sure.


210
0:8:3,835 --> 0:8:5,85
Absolutely.


211
0:8:5,85 --> 0:8:7,99



212
0:8:7,99 --> 0:8:11,6
This is our Boardwalk set.


213
0:8:11,6 --> 0:8:14,7
This is, I think, the size
of a football field.


214
0:8:14,7 --> 0:8:16,16
It took months and
months to build.


215
0:8:16,16 --> 0:8:17,54
It was designed by our
original production


216
0:8:17,54 --> 0:8:19,24
designer, Bob Shaw.


217
0:8:19,24 --> 0:8:21,57
It's essentially a replica of
the Atlantic City boardwalk,


218
0:8:21,57 --> 0:8:24,23
circa 1920.


219
0:8:24,23 --> 0:8:27,2
Most of the stories you see are
based on the research of


220
0:8:27,2 --> 0:8:30,23
stores that were very similar
or actually existed in


221
0:8:30,23 --> 0:8:31,36
Atlantic City.


222
0:8:31,36 --> 0:8:35,429
The Fralinger's taffy store
is actually still there.


223
0:8:35,429 --> 0:8:39,26
And the incubator baby exhibit
was actually something that


224
0:8:39,26 --> 0:8:42,71
was in Atlantic City
and Coney Island.


225
0:8:42,71 --> 0:8:43,69
THOMAS MORTON: Worth paying
$0.25 to see,


226
0:8:43,69 --> 0:8:44,45
some underweight babies.


227
0:8:44,45 --> 0:8:46,77
TERENCE WINTER: Yeah.


228
0:8:46,77 --> 0:8:48,66
Really, Atlantic City was
so cool because it means


229
0:8:48,66 --> 0:8:52,8
everything from highbrow
entertainment, like the best


230
0:8:52,8 --> 0:8:55,61
of Broadway, to lowbrow stuff,
like carnival stuff.


231
0:8:55,61 --> 0:8:59,12



232
0:8:59,12 --> 0:9:0,79
THOMAS MORTON: How much
research did--


233
0:9:0,79 --> 0:9:4,38
I know you're fastidious about
it for the creation of the


234
0:9:4,38 --> 0:9:7,68
show, but in its initial
inception, how much background


235
0:9:7,68 --> 0:9:10,275
had you done when you were
bringing it to the table?


236
0:9:10,275 --> 0:9:12,51
TERENCE WINTER: Oh, months
and months of research.


237
0:9:12,51 --> 0:9:15,0
There are so many different
components to the show.


238
0:9:15,0 --> 0:9:18,8
There's the World War I
component with Jimmy Darmody.


239
0:9:18,8 --> 0:9:19,965
-I've been kissing your
ass since I was 12.


240
0:9:19,965 --> 0:9:24,18
-And what about the
last three years?


241
0:9:24,18 --> 0:9:25,6
-I wanted to serve my country.


242
0:9:25,6 --> 0:9:26,87
-And nearly get yourself
killed.


243
0:9:26,87 --> 0:9:28,91
TERENCE WINTER: There was the
prohibition component, the


244
0:9:28,91 --> 0:9:29,98
political component.


245
0:9:29,98 --> 0:9:33,99
-This establishment is being
shuttered for violation of the


246
0:9:33,99 --> 0:9:34,53
Volstead Act.


247
0:9:34,53 --> 0:9:35,88
-It's loaded, sir.


248
0:9:35,88 --> 0:9:39,56
There is over 200 cases of
brandy wine and champagne.


249
0:9:39,56 --> 0:9:40,97
TERENCE WINTER: Pop culture--


250
0:9:40,97 --> 0:9:43,58
there were so many different
aspects of the show--


251
0:9:43,58 --> 0:9:45,41
what was going on in the
gangster world, what was going


252
0:9:45,41 --> 0:9:47,446
on in Chicago.


253
0:9:47,446 --> 0:9:49,92
-You guys gonna get into the
liquor business, too?


254
0:9:49,92 --> 0:9:51,84
THOMAS MORTON: Now, was there
something before the book that


255
0:9:51,84 --> 0:9:54,79
led you into it, or was that
the primary source?


256
0:9:54,79 --> 0:9:55,9
TERENCE WINTER: No.


257
0:9:55,9 --> 0:9:56,55
The book--


258
0:9:56,55 --> 0:9:59,12
I started there, and the book
was given to me by HBO.


259
0:9:59,12 --> 0:10:1,38
This wasn't something that was
necessarily on my radar.


260
0:10:1,38 --> 0:10:3,48
I didn't know what I was going
to do next after The Sopranos.


261
0:10:3,48 --> 0:10:6,82
HBO called me up in 2007 during
the last season, and


262
0:10:6,82 --> 0:10:8,67
they said we have a book called
Boardwalk Empire.


263
0:10:8,67 --> 0:10:10,39
It's basically the history
of Atlantic City.


264
0:10:10,39 --> 0:10:12,29
Why don't you read it and see
if you think there's a TV


265
0:10:12,29 --> 0:10:13,5
series in there.


266
0:10:13,5 --> 0:10:15,57
And oh, by the way, Martin
Scorcese's attached to this.


267
0:10:15,57 --> 0:10:19,2



268
0:10:19,2 --> 0:10:22,87
The signage has changed from
season to season, too, because


269
0:10:22,87 --> 0:10:24,28
they advertise different things
on the boardwalk.


270
0:10:24,28 --> 0:10:28,49



271
0:10:28,49 --> 0:10:31,16
This set over here we're
coming to is called the


272
0:10:31,16 --> 0:10:33,24
Swiss-Knit Shop.


273
0:10:33,24 --> 0:10:36,17
And we couldn't figure
out what that was.


274
0:10:36,17 --> 0:10:39,81
And what it is is that people
would rent bathing suits, and


275
0:10:39,81 --> 0:10:41,81
they were knit wool
bathing suits.


276
0:10:41,81 --> 0:10:44,49
So you wear a wool bathing suit,
and then give it back,


277
0:10:44,49 --> 0:10:47,1
and it was actually rented
to somebody else.


278
0:10:47,1 --> 0:10:48,42
THOMAS MORTON: I think
I'd rather spend my


279
0:10:48,42 --> 0:10:50,842
quarter on the preemies.


280
0:10:50,842 --> 0:10:53,19
TERENCE WINTER: Actually, the
boards on this are actually--


281
0:10:53,19 --> 0:10:54,45
this is the level of detail--


282
0:10:54,45 --> 0:10:56,88
I don't know if you noticed,
like, some of them, like, form


283
0:10:56,88 --> 0:10:58,96
an arrow facing that way,
and some form an


284
0:10:58,96 --> 0:11:0,42
arrow facing that way.


285
0:11:0,42 --> 0:11:4,13
If you're moving either north
or south on the boardwalk,


286
0:11:4,13 --> 0:11:6,38
they basically tell you
which way to walk.


287
0:11:6,38 --> 0:11:7,0
THOMAS MORTON: Oh, so they're
kind of like lanes.


288
0:11:7,0 --> 0:11:7,92
TERENCE WINTER: Yeah, sort of.


289
0:11:7,92 --> 0:11:10,44
If you're heading this
way, stay this side.


290
0:11:10,44 --> 0:11:11,7
And that way, the other side.


291
0:11:11,7 --> 0:11:12,78
THOMAS MORTON: You mean that's
how it is on the


292
0:11:12,78 --> 0:11:13,38
Atlantic City boardwalk?


293
0:11:13,38 --> 0:11:13,63
I've never heard of that.


294
0:11:13,63 --> 0:11:14,11
TERENCE WINTER: Yeah, these are


295
0:11:14,11 --> 0:11:17,42
absolutely the same pattern.


296
0:11:17,42 --> 0:11:19,1
THOMAS MORTON: Psychological
pressure to keep moving.


297
0:11:19,1 --> 0:11:20,9
TERENCE WINTER: Yeah,
exactly, and head


298
0:11:20,9 --> 0:11:20,78
in the right direction.


299
0:11:20,78 --> 0:11:24,7
One of the few things that we
purposely changed was the fact


300
0:11:24,7 --> 0:11:26,4
that our benches face
toward the ocean.


301
0:11:26,4 --> 0:11:28,46
In Atlantic City, they actually
face toward the


302
0:11:28,46 --> 0:11:30,64
boardwalk, so people would
actually watch each other


303
0:11:30,64 --> 0:11:34,2
promenade in their Easter
bonnets and stuff.


304
0:11:34,2 --> 0:11:37,12
But we figured, in modern day
you'd want to look at the


305
0:11:37,12 --> 0:11:39,95
ocean, even though we don't
have an actual ocean.


306
0:11:39,95 --> 0:11:43,36
We put it in later digitally.


307
0:11:43,36 --> 0:11:45,71
This is the Ritz Carlton
set where Nucky


308
0:11:45,71 --> 0:11:49,3
lives and has his offices.


309
0:11:49,3 --> 0:11:51,85
He actually lived in the real
Ritz Carlton in Atlantic City,


310
0:11:51,85 --> 0:11:55,9
but the real Ritz Carlton was
one of the few really kind of


311
0:11:55,9 --> 0:11:56,49
boring looking structures.


312
0:11:56,49 --> 0:12:1,4
It didn't really have anything
special about it, so we


313
0:12:1,4 --> 0:12:2,1
cheated a little.


314
0:12:2,1 --> 0:12:5,26
We took another hotel whose
name I can't remember, and


315
0:12:5,26 --> 0:12:6,87
said, well, we'll call that
the Ritz Carlton because


316
0:12:6,87 --> 0:12:10,39
nobody really knows, because
it just looked more fancy--


317
0:12:10,39 --> 0:12:14,51
so built it out, and, yeah, a
little more, like, befitting a


318
0:12:14,51 --> 0:12:16,26
guy like Nucky.


319
0:12:16,26 --> 0:12:20,68
And the great thing about this
set is you can come right in


320
0:12:20,68 --> 0:12:22,1
and go all the way
to the elevators.


321
0:12:22,1 --> 0:12:25,1
And the elevators don't go up,
but the doors open and close.


322
0:12:25,1 --> 0:12:27,88
So you can take him right off
the elevator, open it up, and


323
0:12:27,88 --> 0:12:32,51
have people in here talking,
drinking tea, playing the


324
0:12:32,51 --> 0:12:34,6
piano, and right all the way
straight out into the


325
0:12:34,6 --> 0:12:36,56
boardwalk in one shot,
and it just really


326
0:12:36,56 --> 0:12:38,2
makes it come alive.


327
0:12:38,2 --> 0:12:40,45
It's also, you remember this
factored in pretty


328
0:12:40,45 --> 0:12:42,55
heavily in Season 1--


329
0:12:42,55 --> 0:12:45,35
the Belle Femme dress shop--
and this-- same thing--


330
0:12:45,35 --> 0:12:48,39
you can walk right in there, and
have people interacting,


331
0:12:48,39 --> 0:12:49,52
and looking through
the window.


332
0:12:49,52 --> 0:12:52,22
And it just gives life
that goes far


333
0:12:52,22 --> 0:12:53,45
beyond your normal set.


334
0:12:53,45 --> 0:12:57,11
And, just again, the level of
detail from our production


335
0:12:57,11 --> 0:12:59,24
design, it's just--


336
0:12:59,24 --> 0:13:0,65
everything just looks so--


337
0:13:0,65 --> 0:13:2,61
see, this chandelier is like--


338
0:13:2,61 --> 0:13:3,872
yeah, it's amazing.


339
0:13:3,872 --> 0:13:4,696
THOMAS MORTON: It's
incredible.


340
0:13:4,696 --> 0:13:5,11
Well, thank you, man.


341
0:13:5,11 --> 0:13:6,16
This has been a real
good time.


342
0:13:6,16 --> 0:13:7,55
TERENCE WINTER: My
pleasure, man.


343
0:13:7,55 --> 0:13:8,305
Really nice meeting you
and talking to you.


344
0:13:8,305 --> 0:15:8,305
