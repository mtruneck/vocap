###1 BRAYDEN OLSON: Hey, my name's Brayden, and I'm going to the
###3 Westminster Dog Show at Madison Square Garden on acid.
###6 
###25 See you guys tomorrow, or later today.
###27 
###30 Whoa, look at that smoke.
###31 
###35 JONATHAN SMITH: So how many times have you tripped
###37 acid in your life?
###38 BRAYDEN OLSON: Zero.
###39 JONATHAN SMITH: Zero times.
###40 So today's the first time.
###41 BRAYDEN OLSON: But I've never been to a dog
###43 show, either, so.
###44 JONATHAN SMITH: So it's two firsts.
###45 BRAYDEN OLSON: It's two--
###46 two new things for me today.
###48 JONATHAN SMITH: There's actually going to be 986 dogs
###50 competing today.
###51 BRAYDEN OLSON: That's a lot of digs.
###53 JONATHAN SMITH: What do you think it's going to be like,
###54 tripping for the first time at the biggest
###56 dog show in the world?
###57 BRAYDEN OLSON: I think it would be fun to go there not
###58 on acid, so on acid it's probably gonna be amazing.
###61 JONATHAN SMITH: Yeah.
###62 It's gonna be way better.
###62 BRAYDEN OLSON: Yeah.
###63 I'm gonna try and find dogs with good vibes.
###66 Fluffy dogs.
###69 Nice dogs.
###70 I'm kind of scared of seeing a Greyhound.
###72 
###75 JONATHAN SMITH: What are your three favorite dog names?
###77 
###80 BRAYDEN OLSON: I'm not really for naming animals.
###82 JONATHAN SMITH: Not at all?
###82 BRAYDEN OLSON: No, not really.
###83 JONATHAN SMITH: How are you feeling right now?
###85 BRAYDEN OLSON: Feel good.
###87 JONATHAN SMITH: Yeah?
###87 BRAYDEN OLSON: Yeah.
###87 JONATHAN SMITH: You seeing anything?
###88 Is it--
###89 have butterflies in your stomach or anything?
###91 BRAYDEN OLSON: No.
###91 I feel totally, like, relaxed.
###94 
###100 It's like there's a lot of fucking birds out here.
###102 JONATHAN SMITH: Yeah.
###102 There's actually no birds around at all.
###104 BRAYDEN OLSON: There's birds over there.
###106 There's birds on that thing.
###108 There's birds on that roof.
###110 They're all making noise.
###112 [LAUGHS]
###116 On the roof, I heard a lot of birds chirping like crazy.
###120 Things slowly started getting confusing.
###124 It heightens your senses.
###127 You can hear, like, sounds from really far away.
###129 And things that aren't necessarily really interesting
###133 are just extremely interesting.
###136 JONATHAN SMITH: Let's go.
###137 Let's do this.
###139 BRAYDEN OLSON: We got into a car, which I was not excited
###141 about, after we left the roof.
###143 Taking acid in New York is a little bit crazier than taking
###148 acid, let's say, like on a lake or in the woods, which I
###151 would prefer.
###153 There's nowhere to go anywhere in New York where there's no
###156 one at, especially at Madison Square Garden.
###160 You're stuck there.
###160 So you have to enjoy it.
###162 
###166 When we got there, we had absolutely no idea what we
###169 were going to do.
###170 
###183 That dog is crazy.
###187 Oh my god.
###188 
###192 It was sort of freeing to just be that dumb and to just take
###197 everything in and be like, it's OK.
###200 I know that I'm on drugs.
###202 
###207 I was just very aware of where I was at and the types of
###210 people that I could go and talk to.
###214 We're here at the 136th Westminster Dog Show.
###218 And we're going to talk to Clyde Barry, who's a very
###223 well-known dog owner.
###226 Excuse me.
###227 Would you mind--?
###229 JEFF BRUCKER: One-- one second, Gary.
###231 BRAYDEN OLSON: Sorry, what was your name?
###232 JEFF BRUCKER: Jeff Brucker.
###233 BRAYDEN OLSON: Jeff-- oh, I thought you were someone else.
###235 JEFF BRUCKER: No.
###235 I'm not.
###235 BRAYDEN OLSON: I'm sorry.
###238 Wasn't him.
###240 I definitely took advantage of the press pass, because you
###244 could-- basically, you had free rein on the whole place
###247 to do whatever I wanted, 'cause we had a camera.
###250 So people would talk to you.
###251 You were like validated.
###253 It was pretty empowering.
###254 
###256 BRAYDEN OLSON: These two ladies know more
###258 about dogs than I do.
###260 First of all, do you both--
###263 do you both--
###263 FEMALE SPEAKER 1: Breed.
###264 BRAYDEN OLSON: Do you both breed dogs?
###265 FEMALE SPEAKER 1: We both breed--
###266 BRAYDEN OLSON: Are you both doggers?
###267 FEMALE SPEAKER 2: Yes.
###268 FEMALE SPEAKER 1: We're both dog people.
###269 BRAYDEN OLSON: Is that a term?
###270 Doggers?
###271 FEMALE SPEAKER 1: No.
###271 Dog people.
###272 BRAYDEN OLSON: Dog people.
###273 The lighting's really nice in here.
###275 FEMALE SPEAKER 3: Yes.
###275 BRAYDEN OLSON: Makes it nice to take photos.
###277 And the colors.
###278 Are you here just to see the dogs?
###279 DOG HANDLER: No, I'm a handler.
###280 BRAYDEN OLSON: Oh, you are?
###281 You're definitely the prettiest
###282 girl at the dog show.
###283 DOG HANDLER: Oh, thank you.
###284 Thanks.
###287 BRAYDEN OLSON NARRATING: I really liked the older man who
###288 told me the joke about how women at cat shows are fatter.
###292 MALE SPEAKER 1: You know, the difference between a dog show
###295 and a cat show is that at a cat show, the women are really
###298 heavy, because you don't have to run the cats.
###301 And at a dog show, people are a lot slimmer.
###304 So I've come to the conclusion, dog shows are
###306 healthier than cat shows.
###308 [BLOWS IN MIC]
###310 BRAYDEN OLSON: There wasn't really press walking around
###312 and just asking people questions, so they probably
###314 thought I was like really official.
###316 So I felt like I could go up to anyone and just sort of
###318 play with their head and just do whatever I wanted.
###321 
###327 Can I ask you a few questions about the show?
###329 FEMALE SPEAKER 4: Sure.
###330 BRAYDEN OLSON: Just about what your name, and--
###332 FEMALE SPEAKER 4: OK.
###334 BRAYDEN OLSON: Is she wearing a diaper?
###335 FEMALE SPEAKER 5: She's wearing, um, a panty.
###337 BRAYDEN OLSON: A panty.
###338 FEMALE SPEAKER 5: Yeah.
###338 She's-- time of the month.
###339 BRAYDEN OLSON: That's a little sexier.
###340 FEMALE SPEAKER 5: Yeah.
###341 BRAYDEN OLSON: I didn't know dogs had a time of the month.
###343 FEMALE SPEAKER 5: They do.
###343 About every six months.
###344 BRAYDEN OLSON: I didn't know that.
###345 FEMALE SPEAKER 5: Yep.
###346 BRAYDEN OLSON: That's like a time of the year.
###347 FEMALE SPEAKER 5: Time of the year.
###348 Yes.
###348 There you go.
###349 BRAYDEN OLSON: What's your name?
###351 MATT STANDER: Matt.
###351 Matt Stander.
###351 BRAYDEN OLSON: And you are you with?
###353 MATT STANDER: Dog News.
###353 BRAYDEN OLSON: Dog News.
###354 Um, I don't know much about Dog News, but if you could
###357 tell us a little bit about what you guys do--
###359 MATT STANDER: It's a vertical publication for
###360 the show-going public.
###361 It's been printed weekly for the last 28 years.
###365 BRAYDEN OLSON: Wow.
###365 OK.
###366 That's about it.
###367 MATT STANDER: That do it?
###368 BRAYDEN OLSON: Yeah.
###368 Thank you.
###370 
###373 I started to get more and more confused as it started taking
###376 effect more.
###377 MALE SPEAKER 2: Well, it depends.
###379 Some years, sometimes they'll go for--
###381 BRAYDEN OLSON: There was a point where I was just, like,
###383 holding a microphone and had no idea what they were saying.
###386 Like I could see them talking.
###387 I could hear it.
###389 But none of it made sense.
###391 There was this fan there.
###392 I think it was coming from the top, but it was just, like,
###395 blowing my face.
###398 [WIND IN MICROPHONE]
###402 BRAYDEN OLSON: It's pretty good.
###404 I actually don't want to leave.
###406 You guys-- are we leaving?
###408 [WIND IN MICROPHONE]
###410 BRAYDEN OLSON: I remember thinking it felt like I was in
###411 a desert and there was, like, sand whipping
###414 around me and stuff.
###415 And it was one of the best feelings, and I was trying to
###417 do interviews in it.
###418 It was so horrible.
###420 FEMALE SPEAKER 6: Today we showed Black Russian terriers,
###422 Norfolk terriers, Brittanys, Vizslas,
###425 Goldens, and Labradors.
###426 BRAYDEN OLSON: Oh my god.
###427 [APPLAUSE]
###433 BRAYDEN OLSON: I just walked around and
###434 ended up in the bleachers.
###436 I was kind of alone, but like, there was
###438 tons of people around.
###439 So I kind of spaced out for a while, and
###440 that was really nice.
###443 I was tripping the hardest probably when I was sitting in
###447 the bleachers by myself.
###451 The ceiling had all these crazy lights, and I remember
###454 kind of tripping out, looking at the lights.
###455 And it just felt really good and comforting.
###458 
###469 I like your shirt.
###470 MALE SPEAKER 3: Thank you.
###471 BRAYDEN OLSON: It's a good one.
###474 I came away with a new appreciation for dog owners.
###477 They're very serious about their dogs.
###479 It's like their child.
###481 And it's their life.
###483 That's what they live for.
###484 What's your favorite thing about this dog?
###488 FEMALE SPEAKER 7: Everything.
###489 BRAYDEN OLSON: Everything?
###490 No.
###490 You have to pick one thing.
###492 FEMALE SPEAKER 7: One thing?
###492 His-- his personality.
###493 BRAYDEN OLSON: Yeah?
###495 He's a sweet dog?
###495 FEMALE SPEAKER 7: He's an excellent dog.
###497 This is what he loves to do.
###499 BRAYDEN OLSON: Hey.
###500 FEMALE SPEAKER 7: He's saying he loves to show.
###503 BRAYDEN OLSON: I like dogs, but not like on that level.
###505 So.
###507 
###511 I remember tripping, but it's weird.
###513 I don't remember a lot of it.
###516 I just remember bits and pieces and
###519 being really confused.
###520 I didn't really have visuals.
###521 Like things were a little brighter and stuff, but there
###523 wasn't-- like dogs weren't like flying through the air.
###526 Which is what--
###527 I kind of hoped that would happen.
###528 But I kind of--
###529 I'm glad it didn't, 'cause I probably would've really
###531 freaked out.
###532 The cool thing is, I never had a bad experience.
###535 I was kind of scared that I was gonna freak out, but I
###538 didn't at all.
###539 I had, like, an amazing time.
###541 Definitely a overall good experience on acid.
###546 Sorry, Mom.
###547 
###552 We did like 10 takes of trying to like walk out the door.
###554 And I just remember it was so hard.
###559 JONATHAN SMITH: Come on, dude.
###560 Come on!
###560 Oh, Jesus Christ.
###562 BRAYDEN OLSON: I was sort of scared that I wasn't gonna
###563 leave, though, at a point.
###565 I was like, am I gonna be like this forever?
###567
