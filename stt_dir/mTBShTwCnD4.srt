0:0:1,1 --> 0:0:4,0
"Google began
as a research project in 1996."


2
0:0:4,0 --> 0:0:8,4
"This is a look
at how search has evolved."


3
0:0:8,4 --> 0:0:12,734
Gomes: Our goal is actually
to make improvements to Search


4
0:0:12,734 --> 0:0:15,167
that just answer
the user's information need.


5
0:0:15,167 --> 0:0:18,133
Get them to their answer
faster and faster.


6
0:0:18,133 --> 0:0:21,234
So that there's almost
a seamless connection between


7
0:0:21,234 --> 0:0:23,467
their thoughts and their
information needs


8
0:0:23,467 --> 0:0:30,868
and the search results
that they find.


9
0:0:30,868 --> 0:0:34,2
Singhal: Well, Google was
started based upon algorithms


10
0:0:34,2 --> 0:0:37,167
that Larry and Sergey developed
in Stanford


11
0:0:37,167 --> 0:0:39,67
called the PageRank algorithm.


12
0:0:39,67 --> 0:0:42,1
And they used that algorithm
to indeed build


13
0:0:42,1 --> 0:0:44,667
a very novel way
of searching the web.


14
0:0:44,667 --> 0:0:46,667
Gomes: What was happening
at that point was


15
0:0:46,667 --> 0:0:48,701
there was this huge explosion
of content in the web,


16
0:0:48,701 --> 0:0:50,434
a bigger explosion
of information


17
0:0:50,434 --> 0:0:51,834
than had ever happened before.


18
0:0:51,834 --> 0:0:54,1
And it was getting
increasingly hard to find


19
0:0:54,1 --> 0:0:56,434
the piece of content
you wanted.


20
0:0:56,434 --> 0:0:57,868
"Adwords"


21
0:0:57,868 --> 0:0:59,1
Mayer: In the beginning,


22
0:0:59,1 --> 0:1:0,767
we didn't have
any advertisements at all.


23
0:1:0,767 --> 0:1:2,934
And as we went
to add advertisements,


24
0:1:2,934 --> 0:1:5,4
it was very important to us
that those ads be as relevant


25
0:1:5,4 --> 0:1:7,934
to the search as
the search results themselves.


26
0:1:7,934 --> 0:1:9,968
It was also very important to us
that they be distinguished


27
0:1:9,968 --> 0:1:11,701
from the search results.


28
0:1:11,701 --> 0:1:13,334
Gomes: There was a clear
separation between ads


29
0:1:13,334 --> 0:1:15,267
and Search from the very
earliest times.


30
0:1:15,267 --> 0:1:17,868
Search had one goal
and one goal alone,


31
0:1:17,868 --> 0:1:21,601
to provide the most relevant
information for the user


32
0:1:21,601 --> 0:1:23,601
in the fastest time possible.


33
0:1:23,601 --> 0:1:25,1
"Universal Results"


34
0:1:25,1 --> 0:1:27,501
Mayer: In 1999 and 2000,
we had a search engine


35
0:1:27,501 --> 0:1:28,634
that worked wonderfully,


36
0:1:28,634 --> 0:1:29,968
and it worked wonderfully
for web pages.


37
0:1:29,968 --> 0:1:31,267
One of the things we saw was,


38
0:1:31,267 --> 0:1:32,734
as Google got better and better,


39
0:1:32,734 --> 0:1:34,567
users expected more
and more from it.


40
0:1:34,567 --> 0:1:36,734
They didn't want
just web pages.


41
0:1:36,734 --> 0:1:39,2
They wanted the best possible
information available,


42
0:1:39,2 --> 0:1:41,934
be that a picture or a book.


43
0:1:41,934 --> 0:1:44,2
And so we started looking
at how we could search new


44
0:1:44,2 --> 0:1:45,601
and other forms of content.


45
0:1:45,601 --> 0:1:47,2
And Image Search was
the first of those


46
0:1:47,2 --> 0:1:50,267
because we know that a picture
is worth 1,000 words,


47
0:1:50,267 --> 0:1:52,33
and there were a lot
of times when people would say,


48
0:1:52,33 --> 0:1:53,767
you know, what is turquoise?


49
0:1:53,767 --> 0:1:55,834
You know, we got a search,
"what is turquoise?"


50
0:1:55,834 --> 0:1:57,4
And there's no way
to answer that question


51
0:1:57,4 --> 0:2:1,834
without a picture.


52
0:2:1,834 --> 0:2:3,601
Singhal:
When September 11th happened,


53
0:2:3,601 --> 0:2:6,234
we as Google were
failing our users.


54
0:2:6,234 --> 0:2:9,234
Our users were searching
for "New York Twin Towers,"


55
0:2:9,234 --> 0:2:12,334
and our results had
nothing relevant,


56
0:2:12,334 --> 0:2:15,133
nothing related
to the sad events of the day


57
0:2:15,133 --> 0:2:18,801
because our index was crawled
a month earlier,


58
0:2:18,801 --> 0:2:22,1
and, of course, there was
no news in that index.


59
0:2:22,1 --> 0:2:26,0
So we placed links to all the
news organizations like CNN


60
0:2:26,0 --> 0:2:29,767
right on our front page saying
please visit those sites


61
0:2:29,767 --> 0:2:31,1
to get the news of the day,


62
0:2:31,1 --> 0:2:33,934
because our search is
failing you.


63
0:2:33,934 --> 0:2:36,801
My friend Krishna and I were
attending a conference


64
0:2:36,801 --> 0:2:41,767
at the time, and Krishna started
thinking about the problem,


65
0:2:41,767 --> 0:2:44,234
saying, "If we could
crawl news quickly,


66
0:2:44,234 --> 0:2:47,334
"and we can provide
multiple points of view


67
0:2:47,334 --> 0:2:50,234
"about the same story
to our users,


68
0:2:50,234 --> 0:2:51,868
wouldn't it be amazing?"


69
0:2:51,868 --> 0:2:53,934
That was the birth
of Google News


70
0:2:53,934 --> 0:2:57,33
specialized search service.


71
0:2:57,33 --> 0:2:59,133
Mayer: Well, in 2002, one
of the trends we started to see


72
0:2:59,133 --> 0:3:1,1
was that the web had become
a lot more rich.


73
0:3:1,1 --> 0:3:4,334
More images, more video,
different kinds of content.


74
0:3:4,334 --> 0:3:6,934
And we started to realize that
our users expected Google


75
0:3:6,934 --> 0:3:9,133
to be able to find something
if it existed on the web.


76
0:3:9,133 --> 0:3:13,234
They didn't care if it was text
or a web page or news,


77
0:3:13,234 --> 0:3:15,2
they wanted it all
in one place.


78
0:3:15,2 --> 0:3:17,701
And so we came up with this
notion of Universal Search,


79
0:3:17,701 --> 0:3:19,434
the idea that you could just
go to Google,


80
0:3:19,434 --> 0:3:21,267
and no matter what type
of content it was,


81
0:3:21,267 --> 0:3:23,33
we could find it.


82
0:3:23,33 --> 0:3:25,4
One of the challenges that came
up in Universal Search is that


83
0:3:25,4 --> 0:3:27,534
we were really comparing
apples and oranges.


84
0:3:27,534 --> 0:3:29,801
Singhal: You can imagine
these apples are web pages,


85
0:3:29,801 --> 0:3:33,67
and you can imagine an orange
would be an image.


86
0:3:33,67 --> 0:3:35,534
When we look at ranking images,


87
0:3:35,534 --> 0:3:39,0
we know what the aspect ratio
of an image is,


88
0:3:39,0 --> 0:3:42,4
how big is the image,
how many pixels this image is.


89
0:3:42,4 --> 0:3:45,734
Is it a black and white image
or a color image?


90
0:3:45,734 --> 0:3:50,167
And all these signals are
only relevant to images,


91
0:3:50,167 --> 0:3:52,834
but are not relevant
to web pages.


92
0:3:52,834 --> 0:3:56,534
And that's why Universal Search
was such a hard task


93
0:3:56,534 --> 0:3:59,801
when we did it, because the
science was not fully developed.


94
0:3:59,801 --> 0:4:1,767
Mayer: We basically ended up
putting things


95
0:4:1,767 --> 0:4:3,868
either on the top of the page,
on the bottom of the page,


96
0:4:3,868 --> 0:4:5,367
or somewhere in the middle


97
0:4:5,367 --> 0:4:8,2
because we didn't have
a finer-grained way


98
0:4:8,2 --> 0:4:9,434
of looking
at the relevance,


99
0:4:9,434 --> 0:4:11,434
especially across
different media types.


100
0:4:11,434 --> 0:4:12,434
Singhal: And over the years,


101
0:4:12,434 --> 0:4:14,767
we developed our science
tremendously,


102
0:4:14,767 --> 0:4:17,33
and today we are beginning
to place


103
0:4:17,33 --> 0:4:19,767
several kinds of information
in multiple positions


104
0:4:19,767 --> 0:4:21,3
on our result page


105
0:4:21,3 --> 0:4:22,968
as our algorithms get better
and better.

107
0:4:24,534 --> 0:4:27,734
Gomes: Our goal is to make it
so that the improvement we make


108
0:4:27,734 --> 0:4:29,434
is so much what you wanted


109
0:4:29,434 --> 0:4:31,434
and fits so cleanly
into the flow


110
0:4:31,434 --> 0:4:33,334
of what you are looking for


111
0:4:33,334 --> 0:4:36,167
that you almost don't notice
that it's happened.


112
0:4:36,167 --> 0:4:38,934
And looking back at it, it seems
obvious that that's the way


113
0:4:38,934 --> 0:4:40,934
it should have always been
in the first place.


114

Menzel: When you do need a
specific bit of information,


115
0:4:43,767 --> 0:4:46,267
Google tries to provide you
exactly that


116
0:4:46,267 --> 0:4:48,534
using our Quick Answers.


117
0:4:48,534 --> 0:4:50,4
For example,
take sport scores.


118
0:4:50,4 --> 0:4:53,0
You kind of want to know
what the score is right now.


119
0:4:53,0 --> 0:4:56,534
You want to know how tall is
the Empire State Building?

to come to Google


121
0:4:58,67 --> 0:5:0,4
and get their information
as quickly as they possibly can.


122
0:5:0,4 --> 0:5:2,701
And with Instant,
you don't even have to type in


123
0:5:2,701 --> 0:5:3,901
your full thought.


124
0:5:3,901 --> 0:5:5,1
You don't have to hit enter.


125
0:5:5,1 --> 0:5:7,501
You can type in
something like, "bike h,"

129
0:5:12,667 --> 0:5:14,434
Menzel:
We are pushing the boundaries


130
0:5:14,434 --> 0:5:17,767
of how you actually
fundamentally interact


131
0:5:17,767 --> 0:5:19,2
with the search engine itself.


132
0:5:19,2 --> 0:5:22,501
With Search by Image,
you can actually use that image


133
0:5:22,501 --> 0:5:24,801
as an input for the search.


134
0:5:24,801 --> 0:5:27,133
Singhal: The truth is that
our users need


135
0:5:27,133 --> 0:5:29,868
much more complex answers.


136
0:5:29,868 --> 0:5:34,167
My dream has always been to
build the "Star Trek" computer.


137
0:5:34,167 --> 0:5:36,868
And in my ideal world,


138
0:5:36,868 --> 0:5:40,868
I would be able to walk up
to a computer and say,


139
0:5:40,868 --> 0:5:46,234
"Hey, what is the best time
for me to sow seeds in India,


140
0:5:46,234 --> 0:5:48,868
given that monsoon
was early this year?"


141
0:5:48,868 --> 0:5:51,667
And once we can answer
that question,


142
0:5:51,667 --> 0:5:53,334
which we don't today,


143
0:5:53,334 --> 0:5:54,968
people will be
looking for answers


144
0:5:54,968 --> 0:5:57,133
to even more
complex questions.


145
0:5:57,133 --> 0:5:59,868
These are all genuine
information needs.


146
0:5:59,868 --> 0:6:3,868
Genuine questions that,
if we, Google, can answer,


147
0:6:3,868 --> 0:6:6,801
our users would become
more knowledgeable,


148
0:6:6,801 --> 0:8:6,801
and they would be more satisfied
in their quest for knowledge.
