MICHAEL HOLSTINE: We're standing
on top of level four


4
0:0:20,68 --> 0:0:24,62
of the Green Bank Telescope,
the largest fully steerable


5
0:0:24,62 --> 0:0:27,22
radio telescope in the world.


6
0:0:27,22 --> 0:0:30,96
We're standing directly under
the reflector for the main


7
0:0:30,96 --> 0:0:35,2
structure, which is
2.4 acres in size.


8
0:0:35,2 --> 0:0:48,96

0:0:48,96 --> 0:0:50,81
KAREN O'NEIL: Radio astronomy
started back in


10
0:0:50,81 --> 0:0:52,48
the 1920s and '30s.


11
0:0:52,48 --> 0:0:54,41
It really got its start when
people were surveying the


12
0:0:54,41 --> 0:0:57,41
radio sky to understand noise
that they were seeing within


13
0:0:57,41 --> 0:0:58,76
their own radio observations.


14
0:0:58,76 --> 0:1:1,43
And they began to realize that
that radio noise was actually


15
0:1:1,43 --> 0:1:4,42
coming from outer space, from
the sun, from the stars, and


16
0:1:4,42 --> 0:1:6,88
from the distant galaxies
that we see out there.


17
0:1:6,88 --> 0:1:8,79
And so with that became the
field of radio astronomy.


18
0:1:8,79 --> 0:1:12,21
And that grew and grew until
eventually, in the 1950s--


19
0:1:12,21 --> 0:1:13,26
1956--


20
0:1:13,26 --> 0:1:15,54
the United States realized that
if we were going to be a


21
0:1:15,54 --> 0:1:18,85
player in this new field of
science, we needed to build a


22
0:1:18,85 --> 0:1:21,7
national radio astronomy
facility.


23
0:1:21,7 --> 0:1:23,71
When they decided to build a
national radio astronomy


24
0:1:23,71 --> 0:1:26,14
facility, they began looking
around the country to


25
0:1:26,14 --> 0:1:29,28
determine where the best site
for that facility would be.


26
0:1:29,28 --> 0:1:30,56
And they had a lot of different


27
0:1:30,56 --> 0:1:31,49
criteria in that decision.


28
0:1:31,49 --> 0:1:34,2
But one of the biggest, and
possibly most important in the


29
0:1:34,2 --> 0:1:37,4
long run, was they wanted an
area where radio frequency


30
0:1:37,4 --> 0:1:38,23
interference was minimal.


31
0:1:38,23 --> 0:1:42,8
MICHAEL HOLSTINE: You can
imagine, in 1958 there were no


32
0:1:42,8 --> 0:1:45,65
wireless communications
to speak of.


33
0:1:45,65 --> 0:1:49,3
But in the last 10 to
15 years, wireless


34
0:1:49,3 --> 0:1:51,19
technology has exploded.


35
0:1:51,19 --> 0:1:53,82
Everyone has a cell phone.


36
0:1:53,82 --> 0:1:57,28
And now simply because the
telescope is so sensitive


37
0:1:57,28 --> 0:2:0,79
that, for instance, your cell
phone that you're so attached


38
0:2:0,79 --> 0:2:5,15
to, if it, alone, that single
cell phone, were placed on


39
0:2:5,15 --> 0:2:8,669
Mars, for instance, it would be
the brightest radio object


40
0:2:8,669 --> 0:2:10,759
in the sky to us.


41
0:2:10,759 --> 0:2:14,97
So we have to figure out a way
to allow communications,


42
0:2:14,97 --> 0:2:19,21
particularly for emergency
medical purposes, and still


43
0:2:19,21 --> 0:2:22,25
protect the data that the
observer is trying to receive.


44
0:2:22,25 --> 0:2:39,19



45
0:2:39,19 --> 0:2:43,28
So from this point on, beyond
this gate, we require that a


46
0:2:43,28 --> 0:2:47,36
diesel engine only
travel down here.


47
0:2:47,36 --> 0:2:52,85
And you can see the "no
spark plug" sign.


48
0:2:52,85 --> 0:2:57,0
We design, build, and
run these extremely


49
0:2:57,0 --> 0:3:0,1
technologically advanced
instruments.


50
0:3:0,1 --> 0:3:4,64
But here, on site, we can't
use the technology that


51
0:3:4,64 --> 0:3:7,296
everyone else is
used to using.


52
0:3:7,296 --> 0:3:8,81
We don't have cellphones.


53
0:3:8,81 --> 0:3:10,435
We don't have microwave ovens.


54
0:3:10,435 --> 0:3:13,71



55
0:3:13,71 --> 0:3:18,96
There are a few people that are
upset that they can't have


56
0:3:18,96 --> 0:3:23,24
the conveniences that
maybe their aunt and


57
0:3:23,24 --> 0:3:26,53
uncle in Ohio have.


58
0:3:26,53 --> 0:3:30,45
But again, we try to find a way
to work with those people


59
0:3:30,45 --> 0:3:34,31
to provide them what they would
like to have without


60
0:3:34,31 --> 0:3:37,768
having the wireless
be part of it.


61
0:3:37,768 --> 0:3:44,164

62
0:3:44,164 --> 0:3:46,45
KAREN O'NEIL: When the GBT came
along, it's not just very


63
0:3:46,45 --> 0:3:49,15
sensitive, but it has a very
wide frequency range.


64
0:3:49,15 --> 0:3:52,53
That is, we can look at
wavelengths from many, many


65
0:3:52,53 --> 0:3:55,2
meters down to things that are
just three millimeters in


66
0:3:55,2 --> 0:3:57,1
wavelength, so very,
very small.


67
0:3:57,1 --> 0:3:59,73
And with that came the idea of
well, let's just use this


68
0:3:59,73 --> 0:4:2,2
incredibly sensitive telescope
with its incredibly wide


69
0:4:2,2 --> 0:4:4,57
frequency range and go see what
we could find out there.


70
0:4:4,57 --> 0:4:6,5
So they pointed the telescope
into areas where you can


71
0:4:6,5 --> 0:4:8,72
expect to find complex
molecules, like


72
0:4:8,72 --> 0:4:10,6
star formation areas.


73
0:4:10,6 --> 0:4:12,21
And they found very, very
complex molecules, more


74
0:4:12,21 --> 0:4:14,82
complex than anybody would
have imagined, up to very


75
0:4:14,82 --> 0:4:15,89
basic sugars in space.


76
0:4:15,89 --> 0:4:17,85
So that tells us that the
building blocks of life are


77
0:4:17,85 --> 0:4:19,26
everywhere out there.


78
0:4:19,26 --> 0:4:23,11
As Douglas Adams said,
the universe is huge.


79
0:4:23,11 --> 0:4:26,38
It's mind-bogglingly huge.


80
0:4:26,38 --> 0:4:29,48
And we're already discovering
stars that have other


81
0:4:29,48 --> 0:4:33,9
planetary systems, very much
like our own Earth, here in


82
0:4:33,9 --> 0:4:35,7
our own galaxy.


83
0:4:35,7 --> 0:4:38,32
There absolutely is
life out there.


84
0:4:38,32 --> 0:4:42,74
I would even go as far to say as
I think there's intelligent


85
0:4:42,74 --> 0:4:46,319
life out there.


86
0:4:46,319 --> 0:4:48,43
KAREN O'NEIL: The bigger
question is, even if the


87
0:4:48,43 --> 0:4:50,77
universe is teeming with
intelligent life, are we going


88
0:4:50,77 --> 0:4:52,33
to be able to detect
it in our lifetime?


89
0:4:52,33 --> 0:4:54,79
That's an incredibly difficult
feat to do.


90
0:4:54,79 --> 0:4:59,35



91
0:4:59,35 --> 0:5:3,3
MICHAEL HOLSTINE: We are, with a
certain suite of instruments


92
0:5:3,3 --> 0:5:8,12
here right now, at least
trying to reach back to


93
0:5:8,12 --> 0:5:10,78
milliseconds after the
Big Bang occurred.


94
0:5:10,78 --> 0:5:16,36
And we're looking at the epic
of re-ionization, when there


95
0:5:16,36 --> 0:5:20,67
started to be a coalescence
of material.


96
0:5:20,67 --> 0:5:26,85
Once you have star creation, you
have a long laundry list


97
0:5:26,85 --> 0:5:31,9
of things that, at least for
us, end up into human


98
0:5:31,9 --> 0:5:35,39
creation, because we're all
made of the stuff that the


99
0:5:35,39 --> 0:5:37,42
stars produce.


100
0:5:37,42 --> 0:5:41,27
So it's a very interesting
thing to watch.


101
0:5:41,27 --> 0:5:43,7
I really think there was
something before


102
0:5:43,7 --> 0:5:45,11
the Big Bang, too.


103
0:5:45,11 --> 0:5:51,4
I think that there may have been
many big bangs, because


104
0:5:51,4 --> 0:5:57,4
the logic, for me, is there
that it occurred.


105
0:5:57,4 --> 0:6:3,11
Every day, people here think
about those possibilities, not


106
0:6:3,11 --> 0:6:8,34
just whether it's possible, but
how do I go about proving


107
0:6:8,34 --> 0:6:10,8
that that's a possibility?


108
0:6:10,8 --> 0:6:15,84
And the instruments that are
here allow a lot of that work


109
0:6:15,84 --> 0:6:18,19
to be done.
