1
0:0:1,0 --> 0:0:7,4



2
0:0:7,4 --> 0:0:9,44
We are all going to die.


3
0:0:9,44 --> 0:0:14,32
We just don't know how, or when.


4
0:0:14,32 --> 0:0:19,44
Easily snuffed out in an instant,
what is life's meaning?


5
0:0:19,44 --> 0:0:20,8
Oh, man!


6
0:0:20,8 --> 0:0:22,4
I see it, I see it.


7
0:0:22,4 --> 0:0:25,56
We're gonna get closer,
we're gonna get closer.


8
0:0:25,56 --> 0:0:29,52
Over 1,000 tornadoes rip through
the United States every year.


9
0:0:29,52 --> 0:0:34,84
Most do little damage.
This one was different.


10
0:0:34,84 --> 0:0:36,2
There it is.


11
0:0:36,2 --> 0:0:40,6
Oh, my gosh! It's going to go
down that road right there.


12
0:0:40,6 --> 0:0:52,52
Oh, gosh, that is a monster tornado!


13
0:0:52,52 --> 0:0:55,44
Right up there on the back wall,
that was the sanctuary,


14
0:0:55,44 --> 0:0:57,24
that's where the altar was.


15
0:0:57,24 --> 0:1:5,44
Behind that was the house that
I was in, just real close to it.


16
0:1:5,44 --> 0:1:9,24
The tornado destroyed
the city of Joplin, Missouri


17
0:1:9,24 --> 0:1:14,16
and killed 162 people.


18
0:1:14,16 --> 0:1:16,76
That was Green Briar Nursing Home,


19
0:1:16,76 --> 0:1:18,88
and there were five people
died in there.


20
0:1:18,88 --> 0:1:22,72
It's a terrible, terrible sight.
It's an awful sight.


21
0:1:22,72 --> 0:1:24,24
In the face of catastrophe,


22
0:1:24,24 --> 0:1:29,92
this Catholic priest finds comfort
in his religious faith.


23
0:1:29,92 --> 0:1:32,76
I have to believe there's a plan


24
0:1:32,76 --> 0:1:35,88
and that God is going to accomplish
something through this.


25
0:1:35,88 --> 0:1:40,0
I feel like God
is doing something for us.


26
0:1:40,0 --> 0:1:42,64
I think we have to see somewhere
a higher power.


27
0:1:42,64 --> 0:1:47,24
Father Monaghan's faith
must have been tested to the limit


28
0:1:47,24 --> 0:1:49,8
by this terrible experience.


29
0:1:49,8 --> 0:2:1,16
For those of us who don't believe
in any kind of Gods, how do we cope?


30
0:2:1,16 --> 0:2:6,64
More and more people now realise
there is no God.


31
0:2:6,64 --> 0:2:11,12
Yet religious values have dominated
our lives for hundreds of years


32
0:2:11,12 --> 0:2:14,2
and still have a hold over us.


33
0:2:14,2 --> 0:2:18,16
In this series I'm exploring what
reason and science can offer us


34
0:2:18,16 --> 0:2:20,68
in the place of religion


35
0:2:20,68 --> 0:2:23,44
to bring comfort
in the face of death,


36
0:2:23,44 --> 0:2:27,52
help us tell right from wrong,


37
0:2:27,52 --> 0:2:34,8
or provide meaning in an indifferent
and uncaring universe.


38
0:2:34,8 --> 0:2:37,8
So do you think that we in the west
are too materialistic?


39
0:2:37,8 --> 0:2:39,48
So do you think that we in the west
are too materialistic?
I think so.


40
0:2:39,48 --> 0:2:42,44
I suppose Jesus
is an unpaid babysitter.


41
0:2:42,44 --> 0:2:44,76
It's like, if I'm not watching you,
Jesus is.


42
0:2:44,76 --> 0:2:47,2
Do you think mothers are ever
going to meet their babies again?


43
0:2:47,2 --> 0:2:49,8
Do you think mothers are ever
going to meet their babies again?
Yes.


44
0:2:49,8 --> 0:2:57,28
The mothers believe it,
and the fathers.


45
0:2:57,28 --> 0:3:3,16
If there is no God,
what is the meaning of life?


46
0:3:3,16 --> 0:3:6,16
Some of the greatest minds
in history have battled depression


47
0:3:6,16 --> 0:3:10,16
and even toyed with suicide,
struggling to answer


48
0:3:10,16 --> 0:3:16,16
the ultimate question
that we all face - what's the point?


49
0:3:16,16 --> 0:3:21,16
For many, there is no point
if there is no God.


50
0:3:21,16 --> 0:3:24,4
One of the questions I'm most often
asked after giving a lecture


51
0:3:24,4 --> 0:3:27,56
is, "Why do you bother
to get up in the mornings?"


52
0:3:27,56 --> 0:3:53,48
This film is my attempt
to answer that question.


53
0:3:53,48 --> 0:3:55,2
Like most English children,


54
0:3:55,2 --> 0:3:57,2
I was sent to Christian schools


55
0:3:57,2 --> 0:4:0,92
and I was confirmed into the
Church of England at the age of 13.


56
0:4:0,92 --> 0:4:3,36
I believed in the Christian God.


57
0:4:3,36 --> 0:4:6,76
A couple of years later,
I realised it wasn't true.


58
0:4:6,76 --> 0:4:10,16
There was no God.
There was nothing out there.


59
0:4:10,16 --> 0:4:12,52
Many people have had that experience


60
0:4:12,52 --> 0:4:21,28
and different people respond to it
in very different ways.


61
0:4:21,28 --> 0:4:24,96
One of the oddest reactions to
facing up to life without God


62
0:4:24,96 --> 0:4:32,56
was that of the great
Russian novelist Leo Tolstoy.


63
0:4:32,56 --> 0:4:35,2
Like me, Tolstoy was brought up
a Christian


64
0:4:35,2 --> 0:4:37,88
and, as a young man, lost his faith.


65
0:4:37,88 --> 0:4:41,48
He had wealth, a family,
and celebrity status


66
0:4:41,48 --> 0:4:45,36
thanks to his novels War And Peace
and Anna Karenina.


67
0:4:45,36 --> 0:4:51,28
But in his late 40s, he began
to question everything.


68
0:4:51,28 --> 0:4:56,44
Tolstoy was in despair, staring into
an abyss of suicidal depression.


69
0:4:56,44 --> 0:5:1,68
He could find no answer to what
tormented him.


70
0:5:1,68 --> 0:5:3,56
Why do I live?


71
0:5:3,56 --> 0:5:8,8
Is there any meaning in my life
that will not be annihilated


72
0:5:8,8 --> 0:5:11,32
by the inevitability of death?


73
0:5:11,32 --> 0:5:14,28
Desperate to believe that life
had a greater purpose,


74
0:5:14,28 --> 0:5:19,0
Tolstoy scoured philosophy and
the sciences for what it might be,


75
0:5:19,0 --> 0:5:22,2
but his torment only deepened.


76
0:5:22,2 --> 0:5:26,76
You are a temporary incidental
accumulation of particles.


77
0:5:26,76 --> 0:5:38,48
You are a randomly-united
lump of something.


78
0:5:38,48 --> 0:5:54,32
Eventually, Tolstoy found an answer
and stepped back from the abyss.


79
0:5:54,32 --> 0:5:56,72
Mount St Bernard Abbey
in Leicestershire


80
0:5:56,72 --> 0:6:0,4
is home to 36 Cistercian monks.


81
0:6:0,4 --> 0:6:3,92
And this, in essence,
was Tolstoy's solution -


82
0:6:3,92 --> 0:6:9,16
spiritual retreat and devotion.


83
0:6:9,16 --> 0:6:14,32
There are no special announcements
this morning.


84
0:6:14,32 --> 0:6:17,36
Our order is what's called
a contemplative order


85
0:6:17,36 --> 0:6:20,8
so we stay within the confines
of the monastery.


86
0:6:20,8 --> 0:6:23,88
We don't have schools, hospitals
or parishes.


87
0:6:23,88 --> 0:6:26,24
We stay within the monastery.


88
0:6:26,24 --> 0:6:28,6
And you're silent
for part of the day, is that right?


89
0:6:28,6 --> 0:6:31,12
We are, for a good part of the day,
especially in the early morning.


90
0:6:31,12 --> 0:6:33,8
We are, for a good part of the day,
especially in the early morning.
Yes.


91
0:6:33,8 --> 0:6:34,92
So the library is just up here.


92
0:6:34,92 --> 0:6:39,44
Yes.


93
0:6:39,44 --> 0:6:40,96
Oh, my, this is very nice.


94
0:6:40,96 --> 0:6:43,72
It is a very nice library indeed,
yes.


95
0:6:43,72 --> 0:6:47,68
'Like Tolstoy,
these monks live between two worlds.


96
0:6:47,68 --> 0:6:51,68
'Their library is better
than I would have expected.'


97
0:6:51,68 --> 0:6:55,64
Stephen Hawking's Universe,
Just Six Numbers, Carl Sagan.


98
0:6:55,64 --> 0:6:57,4
Excellent, very good.


99
0:6:57,4 --> 0:7:1,12
I wish I'd brought some of my books
to present to you!


100
0:7:1,12 --> 0:7:2,4
Oh, there's one, there! We have one.


101
0:7:2,4 --> 0:7:3,52
Oh, there's one, there! We have one.
Oh, really?


102
0:7:3,52 --> 0:7:5,36
Richard Dawkins,
Modern Science Writing.


103
0:7:5,36 --> 0:7:9,52
Oh, excellent! The Oxford Book of
Modern Science Writing. Very good.


104
0:7:9,52 --> 0:7:12,52
There may be others, erm...


105
0:7:12,52 --> 0:7:20,16
Well, I won't do that usual thing
authors do of looking for them!


106
0:7:20,16 --> 0:7:23,76
Tolstoy's answer to the threat
of meaninglessness


107
0:7:23,76 --> 0:7:29,28
was to go back
and consciously embrace God.


108
0:7:29,28 --> 0:7:31,16
He does exist.


109
0:7:31,16 --> 0:7:33,92
I had only to recognise this
for an instant


110
0:7:33,92 --> 0:7:40,0
and I would feel the possibility
and joy of living.


111
0:7:40,0 --> 0:7:42,24
I returned to a belief in God.


112
0:7:42,24 --> 0:7:48,16
I now knew
that I could not live without it.


113
0:7:48,16 --> 0:7:49,6
As an old man,


114
0:7:49,6 --> 0:7:54,48
Tolstoy separated himself from
society to lead a Christian sect.


115
0:7:54,48 --> 0:7:59,56
He ended up, like these monks,
a religious recluse.


116
0:7:59,56 --> 0:8:4,0
But I want to know, can a person
find meaning and fulfilment,


117
0:8:4,0 --> 0:8:7,6
devoting himself to spiritual life?


118
0:8:7,6 --> 0:8:11,36
Brother Michael, one of
the youngest monks in the order,


119
0:8:11,36 --> 0:8:18,28
has, like Tolstoy, given up
the world and earthly possessions.


120
0:8:18,28 --> 0:8:22,64
My life I direct towards God
and finding a relationship with God,


121
0:8:22,64 --> 0:8:24,6
and I find meaning in that,


122
0:8:24,6 --> 0:8:29,44
and as...hopefully I grow towards
God, I'll grow towards other people.


123
0:8:29,44 --> 0:8:32,56
What do you miss about the life
you could've had?


124
0:8:32,56 --> 0:8:34,48
Erm...


125
0:8:34,48 --> 0:8:37,48
This morning I had to go to
the chemist,


126
0:8:37,48 --> 0:8:42,24
and on the way out,
there was a young lady with her child


127
0:8:42,24 --> 0:8:44,12
and as they walked down the street,


128
0:8:44,12 --> 0:8:47,28
they had Tigger the tiger
holding between their hands.


129
0:8:47,28 --> 0:8:48,68
Tigger from Winnie the Pooh?


130
0:8:48,68 --> 0:8:51,8
Tigger from Winnie The Pooh,
and it stirred my heart.


131
0:8:51,8 --> 0:8:52,8
My heart sort of...


132
0:8:52,8 --> 0:8:55,16
You feel you'd have liked
to have had a child of your own?


133
0:8:55,16 --> 0:8:56,84
Yeah. It's just like...yeah.


134
0:8:56,84 --> 0:9:1,28
I've given up a family,
which is part of the life.


135
0:9:1,28 --> 0:9:4,28
I worry that these men
are running from reality


136
0:9:4,28 --> 0:9:7,72
and squandering their lives.


137
0:9:7,72 --> 0:9:11,4
Isn't facing up to the challenges
of the real world


138
0:9:11,4 --> 0:9:13,36
what makes life worthwhile?


139
0:9:13,36 --> 0:9:15,2
Can you talk while polishing?


140
0:9:15,2 --> 0:9:17,2
Yes.


141
0:9:17,2 --> 0:9:19,84
Brother William gave up a career
as a banker


142
0:9:19,84 --> 0:9:22,72
to join the monastery ten years ago.


143
0:9:22,72 --> 0:9:24,96
The meaning of life for me


144
0:9:24,96 --> 0:9:26,68
is being there for other people.


145
0:9:26,68 --> 0:9:28,2
Yes.


146
0:9:28,2 --> 0:9:29,8
And it's a sacrifice


147
0:9:29,8 --> 0:9:33,56
that I'm willing to make.


148
0:9:33,56 --> 0:9:36,96
But if you want to do good
to other people,


149
0:9:36,96 --> 0:9:39,52
it seems a slightly odd way
to go about it


150
0:9:39,52 --> 0:9:41,48
to shut yourself away
in a monastery.


151
0:9:41,48 --> 0:9:45,52
Couldn't you do more good if you
were out there in the outside world?


152
0:9:45,52 --> 0:9:49,56
You can see how our prayers
affect people's lives,


153
0:9:49,56 --> 0:9:54,68
and how they've come through
a personal problem,


154
0:9:54,68 --> 0:9:57,12
that they've felt our support here.


155
0:9:57,12 --> 0:10:0,84
(THEY CHANT)


156
0:10:0,84 --> 0:10:13,84
These monks find meaning in devotion
to God, in prayer and solitude.


157
0:10:13,84 --> 0:10:16,64
They're entitled to their beliefs
of course.


158
0:10:16,64 --> 0:10:19,56
But, what a slender life to lead


159
0:10:19,56 --> 0:10:21,48
when you could be out there
in the real world,


160
0:10:21,48 --> 0:10:30,0
teaching, learning,
maybe doing good.


161
0:10:30,0 --> 0:10:34,84
It seemed to me to be a sort of
sadly inadequate life.


162
0:10:34,84 --> 0:10:37,92
Not really a life at all.


163
0:10:37,92 --> 0:10:43,36
Just very, very sad.


164
0:10:43,36 --> 0:10:46,12
Of course, I don't believe in God,


165
0:10:46,12 --> 0:10:49,4
but I do understand
Tolstoy's predicament.


166
0:10:49,4 --> 0:10:52,24
I just don't see how cloistering
yourself away like this


167
0:10:52,24 --> 0:10:59,88
can add meaning to life.


168
0:10:59,88 --> 0:11:3,96
Perhaps a better approach would be
to embrace life's uncertainties


169
0:11:3,96 --> 0:11:21,72
and take a few risks?


170
0:11:21,72 --> 0:11:25,8
Many of our greatest minds
have struggled with the idea


171
0:11:25,8 --> 0:11:32,28
that if there is no God,
life has no meaning.


172
0:11:32,28 --> 0:11:35,64
One of the bleakest reactions
was that of Graham Greene.


173
0:11:35,64 --> 0:11:37,2
Greene was of course to become


174
0:11:37,2 --> 0:11:40,4
one of the great Catholic writers
of the 20th century,


175
0:11:40,4 --> 0:11:42,4
but as a young man he was agnostic.


176
0:11:42,4 --> 0:11:46,28
He was also reckless
and extremely bored.


177
0:11:46,28 --> 0:11:50,56
He carried what he called
his "war against boredom"


178
0:11:50,56 --> 0:11:53,72
to a shocking and dangerous extreme.


179
0:11:53,72 --> 0:11:56,56
Greene lived
to the ripe old age of 86,


180
0:11:56,56 --> 0:12:2,28
but statistically he shouldn't
have made it past 19.


181
0:12:2,28 --> 0:12:5,52
"I remember very clearly
the afternoon I found the revolver


182
0:12:5,52 --> 0:12:7,68
"in the brown deal corner cupboard


183
0:12:7,68 --> 0:12:10,88
"in a bedroom which I shared with my
elder brother.


184
0:12:10,88 --> 0:12:14,88
"It was the early autumn of 1923.


185
0:12:14,88 --> 0:12:17,4
"I slipped the revolver
into my pocket


186
0:12:17,4 --> 0:12:22,84
"and the next I remember,
was crossing the Berkhamstead Common
towards Ashridge Beaches."


187
0:12:22,84 --> 0:12:28,96
Greene had been reading a book
about soldiers during the Russian
Civil War.


188
0:12:28,96 --> 0:12:33,28
Away from the frontline,
they invented hazardous games to
avoid boredom.


189
0:12:33,28 --> 0:12:37,72
"This was not suicide, whatever
a coroner's jury might have said,


190
0:12:37,72 --> 0:12:43,32
"it was a gamble with five chances
to one against an inquest.


191
0:12:43,32 --> 0:12:54,6
"I slipped a bullet into a chamber
and holding the revolver behind
my back spun the chambers round.


192
0:12:54,6 --> 0:13:1,8
"I put the muzzle of the revolver
into my right ear."


193
0:13:1,8 --> 0:13:3,4
CHAMBER CLICKS


194
0:13:3,4 --> 0:13:10,2
"There was a minute click and
looking down I could see the charge
had moved into the firing position.


195
0:13:10,2 --> 0:13:12,44
"I was out by one."


196
0:13:12,44 --> 0:13:17,32
Graham Greene lived by chance.
He had absolutely no control


197
0:13:17,32 --> 0:13:21,0
over the outcome
when he pulled the trigger.


198
0:13:21,0 --> 0:13:25,8
What Greene did was utterly crazy.
No matter how bored I was,


199
0:13:25,8 --> 0:13:28,48
I would never trust my life to
chance in such a way.


200
0:13:28,48 --> 0:13:50,6
But the reality is that
we have less control over our lives
than we might like to think.


201
0:13:50,6 --> 0:13:55,76
When a tornado struck Joplin,
Missouri in May 2011,


202
0:13:55,76 --> 0:14:0,16
death and
destruction were indiscriminate.


203
0:14:0,16 --> 0:14:6,32
The young Graham Greene would have
embraced the truth of that tornado.


204
0:14:6,32 --> 0:14:14,2
Joplin's fate hung on chance, just
like his game of Russian roulette.


205
0:14:14,2 --> 0:14:25,12
While 7,000 buildings were blown
away, others survived unscathed.


206
0:14:25,12 --> 0:14:28,44
There is tremendous survivor's guilt
in the community.


207
0:14:28,44 --> 0:14:31,44
That, I haven't experienced before.


208
0:14:31,44 --> 0:14:36,72
Survivor's guilt meaning why did I
survive when someone else died?


209
0:14:36,72 --> 0:14:41,48
Why did that little child die, I'm
70 years of age, why didn't you take
me, God?


210
0:14:41,48 --> 0:14:46,88
Why should that mother
lose that child?


211
0:14:46,88 --> 0:14:49,96
But do you think he could have
stopped the tornado?


212
0:14:49,96 --> 0:14:51,28
Of course he could, he could stop
anything he wants.


213
0:14:51,28 --> 0:14:52,64
Of course he could, he could stop
anything he wants.
Then, why didn't he?


214
0:14:52,64 --> 0:14:56,68
Er...because we don't understand,
it's a mystery, he is a mystery.


215
0:14:56,68 --> 0:14:59,24
I can't intellectually explain that.


216
0:14:59,24 --> 0:15:1,84
And if someone tries to do that,


217
0:15:1,84 --> 0:15:10,4
they're gonna come to a dead end
and say it makes no sense.


218
0:15:10,4 --> 0:15:16,84
It's almost moving the way religious
people struggle, twist and turn
to find some excuse for this,


219
0:15:16,84 --> 0:15:21,8
some sort of meaning,
some part of God's plan.


220
0:15:21,8 --> 0:15:29,96
If it was part of anybody's plan,
what an unthinkably awful plan it
would have to be.


221
0:15:29,96 --> 0:15:36,76
But even if you're an atheist, the
idea of living or dying by chance
alone is hard to accept.


222
0:15:36,76 --> 0:15:39,36
Atheists may think
they've given up God,


223
0:15:39,36 --> 0:15:46,0
but it's only human to cling
to the idea that "things happen
for a reason".


224
0:15:46,0 --> 0:15:50,76
If you look at the misfortune
and fortune in human life,


225
0:15:50,76 --> 0:15:53,2
in the universe generally,


226
0:15:53,2 --> 0:15:57,56
there is no pattern as relates
to people,


227
0:15:57,56 --> 0:15:59,88
the pattern is entirely
related to physics.


228
0:15:59,88 --> 0:16:5,68
The universe has exactly the
properties we'd expect if there was
no plan, no design,


229
0:16:5,68 --> 0:16:22,12
no aim, just blind
indifferent...forces of nature.


230
0:16:22,12 --> 0:16:25,12
If, like Graham Greene, you
understand life as a game of chance,


231
0:16:25,12 --> 0:16:31,24
and if you believe there is no God
pulling your strings, making plans
for you, why not just play the game?


232
0:16:31,24 --> 0:16:40,84
The great gambling game of life.


233
0:16:40,84 --> 0:16:42,32
Unbelievable place.


234
0:16:42,32 --> 0:16:47,48
It's sort of trying to be
the seven wonders of the world.


235
0:16:47,48 --> 0:16:52,44
Look at that medieval castle there.


236
0:16:52,44 --> 0:16:56,16
There's the Statue of Liberty.


237
0:16:56,16 --> 0:17:0,16
There's a replica
of Venice somewhere.
There's the Chrysler Building.


238
0:17:0,16 --> 0:17:7,28
I'm often told that my vision of a
godless future is just as devoid of
meaning as Las Vegas.


239
0:17:7,28 --> 0:17:14,8
That without God,
all you're left with is materialism
and mindless slot machines.


240
0:17:14,8 --> 0:17:19,68
But I've come here
because I think Las Vegas
reveals something fascinating,


241
0:17:19,68 --> 0:17:26,2
humanity's deep-seated belief
that we can prevail over chance.


242
0:17:26,2 --> 0:17:28,6
People come here filled with hope.


243
0:17:28,6 --> 0:17:33,44
Everybody knows the casinos
have a terrific mark-up percentage
for the house


244
0:17:33,44 --> 0:17:41,4
and yet they still go on feeding
that hope and feeding the slot
machines and losing their money.


245
0:17:41,4 --> 0:17:43,8
Hey, Richard. How's it going?


246
0:17:43,8 --> 0:17:44,12
Hey, Richard. How's it going?
OK.


247
0:17:44,12 --> 0:17:44,76
You winning?


248
0:17:44,76 --> 0:17:46,12
You winning?
No, I've lost every time so far.


249
0:17:46,12 --> 0:17:49,64
Well, now your luck's gonna change,
because I know physics!


250
0:17:49,64 --> 0:17:55,92
OK. He may look like a card sharp,
but the gentleman in the shades
is actually a physicist.


251
0:17:55,92 --> 0:18:5,56
Leonard Mlodinow is fascinated by
how human beings are incapable
of understanding chance.


252
0:18:5,56 --> 0:18:7,72
32.


253
0:18:7,72 --> 0:18:11,0
I won and I lost.


254
0:18:11,0 --> 0:18:14,64
When people are playing
these games we see around us,


255
0:18:14,64 --> 0:18:19,68
am I right that many of them,
even if there's absolutely no bias
between red and black,


256
0:18:19,68 --> 0:18:24,28
many people will say, "Oh, well it
has been red, red, red, red for such
a long time, it's black's turn."


257
0:18:24,28 --> 0:18:28,4
That's right. That's called
The Gambler's Fallacy.


258
0:18:28,4 --> 0:18:30,6
I you flip a coin a zillion times,


259
0:18:30,6 --> 0:18:34,48
you're going to get
about half a zillion heads
and half a zillion tails.


260
0:18:34,48 --> 0:18:37,8
So people's thinking goes, if they
bothered to logically think about it,


261
0:18:37,8 --> 0:18:41,76
is that,
"OK, I've seen 10 tails in a row,


262
0:18:41,76 --> 0:18:45,4
"so if it's gonna be half heads
and half tails, the heads better
catch up."


263
0:18:45,4 --> 0:18:46,44
But that's not the way it works.


264
0:18:46,44 --> 0:18:47,48
But that's not the way it works.
OK.


265
0:18:47,48 --> 0:18:52,64
You could throw it a zillion times
and get all heads.


266
0:18:52,64 --> 0:18:59,8
The point about our brain is that it
insists on seeing order, meaning and
pattern even where thereis none.


267
0:18:59,8 --> 0:19:5,4
It's a very human characteristic
to fool ourselves
that we are in control.


268
0:19:5,4 --> 0:19:8,64
In today's world,
it seems that we make more mistakes


269
0:19:8,64 --> 0:19:12,4
seeing patterns that aren't there
rather than missing patterns
that are there.


270
0:19:12,4 --> 0:19:17,64
In fact, there's a great experiment
on that, they put a rat in front of
a red light and a green light.


271
0:19:17,64 --> 0:19:21,76
And the red light and the
green light flash without any
pattern, at random.


272
0:19:21,76 --> 0:19:27,28
But the green light flashes 75% of
the time, and the red light flashes
25% of the time.


273
0:19:27,28 --> 0:19:31,28
And the rat, if it guesses
correctly which is going to flash,
it gets a little sugar water.


274
0:19:31,28 --> 0:19:33,48
So when they let the rats do this,


275
0:19:33,48 --> 0:19:38,0
they see after a while that the
green light is flashing more than
the red light


276
0:19:38,0 --> 0:19:40,56
and they just start guessing
green, green, green, green, green
every time.


277
0:19:40,56 --> 0:19:43,52
And they get it right 75% of the
time and are happy with that.


278
0:19:43,52 --> 0:19:44,96
That's what you should do.


279
0:19:44,96 --> 0:19:45,96
That's what you should do.
Yeah.


280
0:19:45,96 --> 0:19:48,6
But people, we think we know better,
right?


281
0:19:48,6 --> 0:19:53,2
So when they put humans
in front of such an experiment,


282
0:19:53,2 --> 0:19:57,12
they won't do what the rat does.
They've seen that it's 75% green
and they'll guess a pattern.


283
0:19:57,12 --> 0:19:59,68
They'll go, green, green, red,
green, green, green, red.


284
0:19:59,68 --> 0:20:3,8
They'll start spewing out
these red and greens


285
0:20:3,8 --> 0:20:7,4
in some weird pattern
that's tailored to be 75% green
and 25% red,


286
0:20:7,4 --> 0:20:12,2
thinking that they can beat the
system, just like the people here
in the casino think they can.


287
0:20:12,2 --> 0:20:16,4
And when you do that, you end up
about, I think, 60% of the time you
get it right, instead of 75%.


288
0:20:16,4 --> 0:20:18,64
And so the humans are out performed
by a rat.


289
0:20:18,64 --> 0:20:24,4
That's because we see patterns
where there aren't any. That's
just the way our minds work.


290
0:20:24,4 --> 0:20:27,72
Too clever by half. Or too clever
by three quarters, in this case.


291
0:20:27,72 --> 0:20:28,76
Too clever by half. Or too clever
by three quarters, in this case.
Yes.


292
0:20:28,76 --> 0:20:31,2
I'm going to throw everything
on my birthday.


293
0:20:31,2 --> 0:20:32,76
Yours is the 26th? Mine is the 26th!


294
0:20:32,76 --> 0:20:33,8
Yours is the 26th? Mine is the 26th!
Oh, wow!


295
0:20:33,8 --> 0:20:38,32
Both our birthdays are the 26th!
So... (LAUGHS)


296
0:20:38,32 --> 0:20:44,32
26 is even so I'm going to win
that too. Maybe I should put this
on odd?


297
0:20:44,32 --> 0:20:50,12
Perhaps this is part of the
explanation why religion evolved in
the first place,


298
0:20:50,12 --> 0:20:55,56
it satisfied our desperate desire to
find meaning and order in the chaos.


299
0:20:55,56 --> 0:21:0,72
In playing the ultimate game
of chance, Russian roulette,


300
0:21:0,72 --> 0:21:6,84
the young Graham Greene
grasped what so many of us fail to,
there is no pattern.


301
0:21:6,84 --> 0:21:8,48
26! 26!


302
0:21:8,48 --> 0:21:10,96
We have no control.


303
0:21:10,96 --> 0:21:13,52
Ooh! We came so close!


304
0:21:13,52 --> 0:21:17,96
Greene took his chances
and pulled the trigger
on another five occasions


305
0:21:17,96 --> 0:21:26,56
before the effect of what he called
"his adrenaline drug" wore off.


306
0:21:26,56 --> 0:21:32,64
What Greene did may seem crazy, but
there is a grim logic to it. Seize
the reins. Dance with death.


307
0:21:32,64 --> 0:21:35,2
You're going to die anyway.


308
0:21:35,2 --> 0:21:36,68
You're going to die anyway.
CHAMBER CLICKS


309
0:21:36,68 --> 0:21:43,16
Happily for Greene,
he beat the odds.


310
0:21:43,16 --> 0:21:46,76
Greene would later convert to
Roman Catholicism,


311
0:21:46,76 --> 0:21:49,6
but Russian roulette of a kind
stayed with him.


312
0:21:49,6 --> 0:21:57,8
As a journalist and spy,
Greene risked his life
in numerous war zones.


313
0:21:57,8 --> 0:22:0,16
"The fear of ambush served me
just as effectively


314
0:22:0,16 --> 0:22:9,8
"as the revolver from the corner
cupboard in the life-long war
against boredom."


315
0:22:9,8 --> 0:22:13,28
Tolstoy found meaning
by hiding himself away.


316
0:22:13,28 --> 0:22:16,6
Greene
went in the opposite direction.


317
0:22:16,6 --> 0:22:20,72
But the next great mind
I shall consider


318
0:22:20,72 --> 0:22:38,48
tried to argue meaning into even the
most meaningless toil imaginable.


319
0:22:38,48 --> 0:22:43,44
More and more of us now do not
believe in God or life after death.


320
0:22:43,44 --> 0:22:47,8
We live and then we die,
and that's it.


321
0:22:47,8 --> 0:22:56,6
We are born by chance and our lives
are shaped by chance events.


322
0:22:56,6 --> 0:23:0,96
I know this is a difficult pill
to swallow for many people,


323
0:23:0,96 --> 0:23:4,84
especially those for whom religion
still has a hold over their lives.


324
0:23:4,84 --> 0:23:9,64
Many people have struggled
to come to terms with the reality


325
0:23:9,64 --> 0:23:22,12
of a purely physical universe.
So, how do we find meaning?


326
0:23:22,12 --> 0:23:31,16
The Second World War laid bare the
extent of man's capacity for evil.


327
0:23:31,16 --> 0:23:36,56
In Paris, philosophers like
Albert Camus met in cafes like this


328
0:23:36,56 --> 0:23:40,44
to try to make sense
of the brutality.


329
0:23:40,44 --> 0:23:44,8
"Without the aid of eternal values,
it is legitimate


330
0:23:44,8 --> 0:23:50,8
"and necessary to wonder
whether life has a meaning."


331
0:23:50,8 --> 0:23:54,2
Camus was interested
in what he called "the absurd",


332
0:23:54,2 --> 0:23:57,4
that our life must have
meaning for us to value it,


333
0:23:57,4 --> 0:24:1,36
but we live in a world
that offers no meaning.


334
0:24:1,36 --> 0:24:5,12
Unlike Tolstoy and Graham Greene,
Camus rejected religion


335
0:24:5,12 --> 0:24:8,96
as a source of the meaning
he craved.


336
0:24:8,96 --> 0:24:11,84
He found inspiration
in another myth.


337
0:24:11,84 --> 0:24:18,32
The story of a man whom
the Ancient Greek gods had cursed.


338
0:24:18,32 --> 0:24:20,88
Camus consoled himself
with the myth of Sisyphus,


339
0:24:20,88 --> 0:24:23,8
in which Sisyphus was condemned
to spend his whole time


340
0:24:23,8 --> 0:24:27,72
rolling a boulder up a mountain and
then it rolled to the bottom again,


341
0:24:27,72 --> 0:24:29,6
he went to the bottom
and rolled it up again,


342
0:24:29,6 --> 0:24:33,84
and this went on forever.


343
0:24:33,84 --> 0:24:39,28
For Camus, accepting even this
most futile and repetitive of tasks


344
0:24:39,28 --> 0:24:42,2
and not giving up, itself had value.


345
0:24:42,2 --> 0:24:45,68
"The struggle itself towards
the heights


346
0:24:45,68 --> 0:24:48,72
"is enough to fill a man's heart.


347
0:24:48,72 --> 0:24:53,8
"We must imagine Sisyphus happy."


348
0:24:53,8 --> 0:24:54,92
Camus took comfort from this


349
0:24:54,92 --> 0:24:57,6
because by going to the bottom
of the mountain again


350
0:24:57,6 --> 0:25:2,32
and rolling the stone back up,
he was at least doing something.


351
0:25:2,32 --> 0:25:8,16
But can we really find meaning
in futile work?


352
0:25:8,16 --> 0:25:12,36
Sisyphus may seem admirable
to a French intellectual,


353
0:25:12,36 --> 0:25:15,72
but I don't see the appeal
of resigning oneself


354
0:25:15,72 --> 0:25:28,8
to life's injustices.


355
0:25:28,8 --> 0:25:31,76
India -
one of the fastest developing


356
0:25:31,76 --> 0:25:35,76
and most unequal
economies in the world.


357
0:25:35,76 --> 0:25:38,96
The human condition doesn't
come much more human than this,


358
0:25:38,96 --> 0:25:40,76
or much more extreme.


359
0:25:40,76 --> 0:25:44,72
Everything's going on -
the noise, the bustle.


360
0:25:44,72 --> 0:25:46,76
It's like an ant-heap of activity.


361
0:25:46,76 --> 0:25:56,96
It's a terrifying
and yet rather a moving sight.


362
0:25:56,96 --> 0:26:0,96
This latter-day Sisyphus
is called Hori Lal.


363
0:26:0,96 --> 0:26:3,24
His struggle is to clean the streets


364
0:26:3,24 --> 0:26:6,24
and the public lavatory
here in Varanasi.


365
0:26:6,24 --> 0:26:10,32
His task is as endless as Sisyphus'
boulder-rolling.


366
0:26:10,32 --> 0:26:14,48
These streets are never clean.


367
0:26:14,48 --> 0:26:16,4
Do you enjoy your job?


368
0:26:16,4 --> 0:26:20,4
TRANSLATION: Yes, yes.
I enjoy doing my job.


369
0:26:20,4 --> 0:26:21,72
Do you do the same thing every day?


370
0:26:21,72 --> 0:26:24,48
TRANSLATION: Yes, I do it every day.


371
0:26:24,48 --> 0:26:26,44
How long have you been
doing this job?


372
0:26:26,44 --> 0:26:30,24
TRANSLATION: It must be 20 years now.


373
0:26:30,24 --> 0:26:32,64
What hope do you have
for the future?


374
0:26:32,64 --> 0:26:34,24
TRANSLATION: What hope can I have?


375
0:26:34,24 --> 0:26:39,36
I have a job to do
and I will continue doing it.


376
0:26:39,36 --> 0:26:48,52
It's fate. What we have been made,
we will remain. It can't be changed.


377
0:26:48,52 --> 0:26:52,4
I suppose there is something
a bit inspiring about Hori Lal's


378
0:26:52,4 --> 0:26:56,24
cheerfulness and good humour
in the face of life's hardships.


379
0:26:56,24 --> 0:26:59,96
Perhaps it's what Camus saw
in the myth of Sisyphus,


380
0:26:59,96 --> 0:27:2,8
and it's certainly a wonderful
antidote to us whingers


381
0:27:2,8 --> 0:27:5,4
in the rich West,
when we dare to moan about


382
0:27:5,4 --> 0:27:14,88
patchy mobile phone reception,
or the cost of supermarket food.


383
0:27:14,88 --> 0:27:19,4
But what bothers me is why Hori Lal
has been cursed like Sisyphus.


384
0:27:19,4 --> 0:27:22,52
It's because here,
life's lottery begins at birth,


385
0:27:22,52 --> 0:27:26,4
thanks to the confines
of the ancient caste system.


386
0:27:26,4 --> 0:27:30,4
This is the Sunday edition
of the Hindustan Times


387
0:27:30,4 --> 0:27:33,44
and it's got a section called
"Matrimonials",


388
0:27:33,44 --> 0:27:39,8
in which fathers advertise
for husbands for their daughters.


389
0:27:39,8 --> 0:27:43,24
And there's a section
called "Brides",


390
0:27:43,24 --> 0:27:46,48
where men advertise for wives.


391
0:27:46,48 --> 0:27:49,8
And the men are usually described
as handsome.


392
0:27:49,8 --> 0:27:51,36
The women are often described
as homely,


393
0:27:51,36 --> 0:27:53,52
which I presume means home-loving.


394
0:27:53,52 --> 0:27:56,12
But a curious thing
about this matrimonials page


395
0:27:56,12 --> 0:27:58,36
is the way it's classified.


396
0:27:58,36 --> 0:28:1,24
There are headings like Brahmin,


397
0:28:1,24 --> 0:28:6,12
and other names from
the ancient Hindu caste system,


398
0:28:6,12 --> 0:28:12,16
whereby society is stratified
into levels, into separate castes,


399
0:28:12,16 --> 0:28:17,44
which are not supposed
to marry each other.


400
0:28:17,44 --> 0:28:20,2
Ancient Hindu scripture
divided society


401
0:28:20,2 --> 0:28:23,8
into four distinct groups
that you could be born into -


402
0:28:23,8 --> 0:28:26,6
scholars...


403
0:28:26,6 --> 0:28:28,92
warriors...


404
0:28:28,92 --> 0:28:30,56
merchants...


405
0:28:30,56 --> 0:28:33,4
and labourers.


406
0:28:33,4 --> 0:28:37,84
Falling outside this system
were the Dalits, the untouchables,


407
0:28:37,84 --> 0:28:39,8
who, like Hori Lal,


408
0:28:39,8 --> 0:28:54,2
were condemned to shovel
the excrement of the higher castes.


409
0:28:54,2 --> 0:28:57,28
This is where I think
Camus got it wrong.


410
0:28:57,28 --> 0:29:1,4
Rather than accept fate,
surely meaning is found


411
0:29:1,4 --> 0:29:7,92
when we revolt
against outrageous fortune?


412
0:29:7,92 --> 0:29:10,72
Mahendra?  Yes.
Very nice to meet you.


413
0:29:10,72 --> 0:29:16,0
Please come.  Thank you.


414
0:29:16,0 --> 0:29:18,84
TRANSLATION: When my father died,
I was told that


415
0:29:18,84 --> 0:29:20,88
because there is no money
in the family now,


416
0:29:20,88 --> 0:29:22,96
you can't study any more.


417
0:29:22,96 --> 0:29:25,52
At that time I was very sad


418
0:29:25,52 --> 0:29:33,32
because I had this dream
from the start, I have to study.


419
0:29:33,32 --> 0:29:37,8
Like Hori Lal, Mahendra is a Dalit.


420
0:29:37,8 --> 0:29:42,52
His father died when he was 14 years
old, leaving the family penniless.


421
0:29:42,52 --> 0:29:45,44
Mahendra spent the next four years
working as a bonded labourer,


422
0:29:45,44 --> 0:29:47,6
weaving saris.


423
0:29:47,6 --> 0:29:51,92
But, unlike Sisyphus,
Mahendra defied the gods


424
0:29:51,92 --> 0:29:54,76
and threw his boulder away.


425
0:29:54,76 --> 0:29:58,84
TRANSLATION: I had to face so much
discrimination in the society


426
0:29:58,84 --> 0:30:2,48
for being a Dalit that I felt
education could be a good medium


427
0:30:2,48 --> 0:30:5,68
to get out of the system.


428
0:30:5,68 --> 0:30:9,6
A lot of people in your position
would probably have given up.


429
0:30:9,6 --> 0:30:15,16
I hugely admire you for not giving
up, but what drove you at that time?


430
0:30:15,16 --> 0:30:19,6
TRANSLATION: I had always felt
that I have to become


431
0:30:19,6 --> 0:30:23,92
a part of the mainstream society.


432
0:30:23,92 --> 0:30:28,56
And that is why I have this thing
that I have to study a lot


433
0:30:28,56 --> 0:30:36,68
and earn money so that
I can reach mainstream society.


434
0:30:36,68 --> 0:30:39,12
Today, Mahendra is studying
for a master's degree


435
0:30:39,12 --> 0:30:41,84
and wants to fight the Dalit cause -


436
0:30:41,84 --> 0:30:47,44
help other boulder-rollers break
free from their struggle.


437
0:30:47,44 --> 0:30:50,72
It is wonderful to see how
an individual can bring himself


438
0:30:50,72 --> 0:30:57,32
out of poverty and downtrodden-ness.


439
0:30:57,32 --> 0:30:59,84
With Mahendra,
we come closer to finding


440
0:30:59,84 --> 0:31:2,4
at least one worthwhile
meaning of life.


441
0:31:2,4 --> 0:31:4,72
He is creating his own meaning,


442
0:31:4,72 --> 0:31:10,84
but it has a deeper purpose, making
a difference to others as well.


443
0:31:10,84 --> 0:31:13,36
We can find meaning in struggle,


444
0:31:13,36 --> 0:31:16,96
but we have to define
our own meaning in our own struggle,


445
0:31:16,96 --> 0:31:34,64
not one dictated by the gods, by
authority or by accident of birth.


446
0:31:34,64 --> 0:31:37,6
So I think meaning is subjective,


447
0:31:37,6 --> 0:31:40,28
something personal
we may not all agree on.


448
0:31:40,28 --> 0:31:47,36
But that shouldn't be an invitation
to egotism or self-absorption.


449
0:31:47,36 --> 0:31:52,56
Here in northern India,
Westerners still come in droves


450
0:31:52,56 --> 0:32:1,8
in the hope of finding some deeper
meaning in Eastern mysticism.


451
0:32:1,8 --> 0:32:3,24
People go up mountains
for refreshment,


452
0:32:3,24 --> 0:32:5,8
they go up mountains for wisdom.


453
0:32:5,8 --> 0:32:8,56
Moses went up Mount Sinai
and came down


454
0:32:8,56 --> 0:32:11,76
with the tablets
of traditional Hebrew wisdom.


455
0:32:11,76 --> 0:32:14,8
There are lots of people
who come from all over the world


456
0:32:14,8 --> 0:32:17,68
to a place like this,
up a mountain like this,


457
0:32:17,68 --> 0:32:19,56
where there's a Tibetan monastery,


458
0:32:19,56 --> 0:32:26,88
seeking what they would call
spiritual wisdom.


459
0:32:26,88 --> 0:32:31,32
Geshe Lhakdor
is a Master of Tibetan Buddhism.


460
0:32:31,32 --> 0:32:36,48
He's the Dalai Lama's
official translator and archivist.


461
0:32:36,48 --> 0:32:40,44
The complete teaching
of the Buddha is aimed towards


462
0:32:40,44 --> 0:32:43,36
transforming your mental outlook


463
0:32:43,36 --> 0:32:47,48
because the ultimate purpose
is to remove all kinds of problems


464
0:32:47,48 --> 0:32:52,8
and sufferings, and problems
and sufferings and disturbances


465
0:32:52,8 --> 0:32:55,88
cannot be removed
by relying on external forces


466
0:32:55,88 --> 0:32:59,52
or external material sources,
or your relatives and friends.


467
0:32:59,52 --> 0:33:3,28
At the end of the day,
the real source of long-lasting peace


468
0:33:3,28 --> 0:33:7,44
and happiness
has to come from within.


469
0:33:7,44 --> 0:33:9,4
For a Buddhist,


470
0:33:9,4 --> 0:33:12,36
what matters is accepting
that reality will always change.


471
0:33:12,36 --> 0:33:16,16
To be happy in this changing
reality, Buddhists teach that


472
0:33:16,16 --> 0:33:20,88
we must eliminate our attachments
to people and possessions.


473
0:33:20,88 --> 0:33:26,24
I sort of half understand that.


474
0:33:26,24 --> 0:33:28,6
They try to get that sense
of direction or happiness


475
0:33:28,6 --> 0:33:34,92
from material accumulation, from
marriage, from wealth, from name,


476
0:33:34,92 --> 0:33:39,48
but in all these cases here or there,
they get a lot of problems,


477
0:33:39,48 --> 0:33:41,2
a lot of difficulties.


478
0:33:41,2 --> 0:33:44,92
So do you think that we in the West
are too materialistic


479
0:33:44,92 --> 0:33:46,68
in our way of life?


480
0:33:46,68 --> 0:33:49,52
I think so, to be honest.
I think so, I think so.


481
0:33:49,52 --> 0:33:52,52
I think I would agree with you
that one doesn't want to devote


482
0:33:52,52 --> 0:33:56,72
one's life to accumulating material,
hedonistic happiness.


483
0:33:56,72 --> 0:33:59,92
I'm not sure that
I would look inward though.


484
0:33:59,92 --> 0:34:3,36
I think I would I might get
happiness from...


485
0:34:3,36 --> 0:34:5,92
music and from science....


486
0:34:5,92 --> 0:34:8,36
Exactly. When you do something
that is creative,


487
0:34:8,36 --> 0:34:11,96
something that really satisfies
your inner arts, you know.


488
0:34:11,96 --> 0:34:15,16
Yes, but meditating and looking
inwards doesn't sound to me


489
0:34:15,16 --> 0:34:18,32
as though that's really doing that.
Perhaps it helps...


490
0:34:18,32 --> 0:34:21,64
Of course, of course.
The peace and happiness,


491
0:34:21,64 --> 0:34:26,0
the tranquillity that you get
when you know how to stay alone


492
0:34:26,0 --> 0:34:31,32
and go within
cannot be measured by anything else.


493
0:34:31,32 --> 0:34:34,16
While I agree that
an unhealthy consumerism


494
0:34:34,16 --> 0:34:37,44
dominates our lives today,
how convincing is it


495
0:34:37,44 --> 0:34:48,8
that we should detach ourselves from
the real world through meditation?


496
0:34:48,8 --> 0:34:52,96
The great minds we've looked at,
Tolstoy, Greene and Camus,


497
0:34:52,96 --> 0:34:55,64
all stood out
in deeply religious times.


498
0:34:55,64 --> 0:34:58,92
But we are now at a point
in history, in the West at least,


499
0:34:58,92 --> 0:35:2,4
when more people than ever
are atheist.


500
0:35:2,4 --> 0:35:5,56
So if we are finally shaking off
the influence of God,


501
0:35:5,56 --> 0:35:9,56
how nowadays do we find meaning?


502
0:35:9,56 --> 0:35:14,4
I'm going to talk to an outspoken
satirist of modern life.


503
0:35:14,4 --> 0:35:15,84
That's that. No. That's that.


504
0:35:15,84 --> 0:35:32,48
Religion is that "nooooo!"


505
0:35:32,48 --> 0:35:35,32
We've seen that there isn't
a simple, single answer


506
0:35:35,32 --> 0:35:38,12
to the meaning of life
in a world without God.


507
0:35:38,12 --> 0:35:44,0
Meaning is something
we need to carve out for ourselves.


508
0:35:44,0 --> 0:35:46,48
We have to find our own meaning


509
0:35:46,48 --> 0:35:48,64
from the opportunities
and challenges


510
0:35:48,64 --> 0:35:50,4
that life throws our way,


511
0:35:50,4 --> 0:35:54,32
even if that does mean
defying convention sometimes.


512
0:35:54,32 --> 0:35:58,2
I'm going to meet a man who has
definitely defined his own way


513
0:35:58,2 --> 0:36:0,6
and made a huge success of it,


514
0:36:0,6 --> 0:36:4,44
but he has ruffled
quite a few feathers in doing so.


515
0:36:4,44 --> 0:36:7,24
Thanks to everyone in the room
for being good sports.


516
0:36:7,24 --> 0:36:9,92
Thanks to NBC.
Thanks to Hollywood Foreign Press.


517
0:36:9,92 --> 0:36:11,48
Um, thank you for watching at home.


518
0:36:11,48 --> 0:36:15,84
And thank you to God
for making me an atheist.


519
0:36:15,84 --> 0:36:19,16
When I signed off the Golden Globes
by saying...


520
0:36:19,16 --> 0:36:22,12
and thanked God
for making me an atheist,


521
0:36:22,12 --> 0:36:25,0
now, clearly,
that was a play on words.


522
0:36:25,0 --> 0:36:27,96
Um, it was a little bit of


523
0:36:27,96 --> 0:36:32,76
a redressing the balance to everyone
who thanks God for winning an award.


524
0:36:32,76 --> 0:36:34,56
I've never seen so much outrage


525
0:36:34,56 --> 0:36:36,44
as thanking God
for making me an atheist.


526
0:36:36,44 --> 0:36:39,44
Now, correct me if I'm wrong.
If God exists,


527
0:36:39,44 --> 0:36:41,36
He did make me an atheist, didn't he?


528
0:36:41,36 --> 0:36:43,56
Didn't He? Why did He do that?


529
0:36:43,56 --> 0:36:45,2
I read about that.
It was astonishing.


530
0:36:45,2 --> 0:36:47,4
It really did cause outrage, did it?


531
0:36:47,4 --> 0:36:52,8
You usually have to murder
and eat someone


532
0:36:52,8 --> 0:36:54,64
to get that much publicity
in America.


533
0:36:54,64 --> 0:36:55,32
How funny.


534
0:36:55,32 --> 0:36:55,84
How funny.
Yeah.


535
0:36:55,84 --> 0:36:56,88
How funny.
Yeah.
How very funny.


536
0:36:56,88 --> 0:37:1,0
When did you first realise
that you didn't believe in God?


537
0:37:1,0 --> 0:37:3,6
My next brother, Bob,
when I was about eight...


538
0:37:3,6 --> 0:37:6,32
He was 11 years older than me
so he was about 19.


539
0:37:6,32 --> 0:37:12,0
And I was drawing a picture
of Jesus for Bible studies


540
0:37:12,0 --> 0:37:15,52
and he, er...
He came in and he looked at it


541
0:37:15,52 --> 0:37:19,2
and he went,
"Why do you believe in God?"


542
0:37:19,2 --> 0:37:22,36
And my mum went "Bob!"


543
0:37:22,36 --> 0:37:24,8
And I knew from body language.


544
0:37:24,8 --> 0:37:28,92
Why didn't she even want
the question?


545
0:37:28,92 --> 0:37:30,76
Oh. She was hiding something from me.


546
0:37:30,76 --> 0:37:34,64
And I thought about it
and it all made sense.


547
0:37:34,64 --> 0:37:38,96
Then I started reading
and, um, I've, er...


548
0:37:38,96 --> 0:37:42,76
I've been an atheist for 40 years.


549
0:37:42,76 --> 0:37:46,4
I love that some people
mistake atheists for Satanists.


550
0:37:46,4 --> 0:37:48,4
Oh, yes.


551
0:37:48,4 --> 0:37:50,12
I go,
"No, I don't believe in him either."


552
0:37:50,12 --> 0:37:53,68
He's just as ludicrous.
I don't believe in him.


553
0:37:53,68 --> 0:37:57,64
Why can't God sort out Satan?


554
0:37:57,64 --> 0:38:2,56
Why can't he? He's all-powerful.
What's he doing? What's he doing?


555
0:38:2,56 --> 0:38:7,48
'So, why does a 21st-century British
atheist get up in the morning?'


556
0:38:7,48 --> 0:38:9,6
I think you have to have worth.


557
0:38:9,6 --> 0:38:12,96
I think you have to feel in yourself
you have worth.


558
0:38:12,96 --> 0:38:17,36
Friends, family,
a loving relationship...


559
0:38:17,36 --> 0:38:19,4
Um...


560
0:38:19,4 --> 0:38:23,84
Just because we're human
and that's how we're built.


561
0:38:23,84 --> 0:38:26,52
And for me personally,
something creative.


562
0:38:26,52 --> 0:38:31,32
It doesn't have to be painting
the Sistine Chapel.


563
0:38:31,32 --> 0:38:32,92
It can be gardening,


564
0:38:32,92 --> 0:38:35,2
but I think you have to do something
and enjoy it


565
0:38:35,2 --> 0:38:40,2
and fill you free time and stand back
and think, "I did that."


566
0:38:40,2 --> 0:38:45,84
These are all reasons to stay around
for as long as you can.


567
0:38:45,84 --> 0:38:47,72
I would agree with all that,


568
0:38:47,72 --> 0:39:1,36
and I think I would add
"understanding" as well.


569
0:39:1,36 --> 0:39:2,96
Religious believers tell me


570
0:39:2,96 --> 0:39:6,88
they're puzzled that non-believers
like Ricky Gervais and me


571
0:39:6,88 --> 0:39:12,12
can find any meaning or purpose
in a godless existence.


572
0:39:12,12 --> 0:39:17,0
But, for me,
the world teems with meaning.


573
0:39:17,0 --> 0:39:20,4
It is up to each of us
to give our own lives meaning


574
0:39:20,4 --> 0:39:22,6
through our work,
our relationships, and passions,


575
0:39:22,6 --> 0:39:25,4
and, I think,
through one other thing -


576
0:39:25,4 --> 0:39:26,88
understanding who we are,


577
0:39:26,88 --> 0:39:32,12
and trying to understand
why we're here.


578
0:39:32,12 --> 0:39:35,8
That has been the mission
of Western science,


579
0:39:35,8 --> 0:39:41,52
the most important tool
I believe mankind has ever invented.


580
0:39:41,52 --> 0:39:42,88
For centuries,


581
0:39:42,88 --> 0:39:47,24
human eyes could see clearly
no further than only a few miles.


582
0:39:47,24 --> 0:39:50,6
Telescopes enabled our eyes
to leap outwards,


583
0:39:50,6 --> 0:39:54,68
and see distant stars
millions of miles away.


584
0:39:54,68 --> 0:39:56,32
Even better than that,


585
0:39:56,32 --> 0:39:59,16
a telescope
is a kind of time machine.


586
0:39:59,16 --> 0:40:2,8
Because it takes light so long
to reach us from a distant star,


587
0:40:2,8 --> 0:40:4,84
when you look at a distant star


588
0:40:4,84 --> 0:40:9,84
you're looking backwards in time,
maybe hundreds of millions of years.


589
0:40:9,84 --> 0:40:12,0
And if you look at a distant galaxy,


590
0:40:12,0 --> 0:40:16,2
you may be looking at the origin
of the universe itself.


591
0:40:16,2 --> 0:40:21,24
You're looking at the very beginning
of space and time -


592
0:40:21,24 --> 0:40:34,44
the Big Bang.


593
0:40:34,44 --> 0:40:38,28
Humanity's gaze has also turned
towards inner space.


594
0:40:38,28 --> 0:40:41,96
Microscopes have unlocked
our understanding of the cells


595
0:40:41,96 --> 0:40:44,4
that make up all living things


596
0:40:44,4 --> 0:40:47,24
and revealed the world of
the smallest and simplest organisms


597
0:40:47,24 --> 0:40:49,76
around us and in us.


598
0:40:49,76 --> 0:40:51,72
The new science of genetics


599
0:40:51,72 --> 0:40:55,56
has unexpectedly
completely revolutionised


600
0:40:55,56 --> 0:40:59,48
and unified our understanding
of life on Earth.


601
0:40:59,48 --> 0:41:3,96
Meanwhile, physics has discovered
particles smaller by far


602
0:41:3,96 --> 0:41:6,32
even than the atom.


603
0:41:6,32 --> 0:41:8,52
And at laboratories like CERN,


604
0:41:8,52 --> 0:41:11,16
scientists studying the collisions
of these particles


605
0:41:11,16 --> 0:41:13,32
are on the cusp of understanding


606
0:41:13,32 --> 0:41:18,92
how the universe got started
in the first place.


607
0:41:18,92 --> 0:41:25,96
The poet John Keats voiced what
many people fear about science -


608
0:41:25,96 --> 0:41:27,56
..that, in explaining the world,


609
0:41:27,56 --> 0:41:34,44
it makes it less amazing,
less extraordinary, somehow banal.


610
0:41:34,44 --> 0:41:38,2
"Philosophy will clip
an Angel's wings,


611
0:41:38,2 --> 0:41:42,44
"Conquer all mysteries
by rule and line,


612
0:41:42,44 --> 0:41:45,96
"Empty the haunted air
and gnomed mine -


613
0:41:45,96 --> 0:41:51,48
"Unweave a rainbow."


614
0:41:51,48 --> 0:41:54,44
Keats could not have been
more wrong.


615
0:41:54,44 --> 0:41:57,2
Isaac Newton's unweaving
of the rainbow


616
0:41:57,2 --> 0:42:0,2
led directly to a massive
deepening and widening


617
0:42:0,2 --> 0:42:2,72
of our understanding
of the universe.


618
0:42:2,72 --> 0:42:6,92
It led to James Clerk Maxwell's
theory of electromagnetism


619
0:42:6,92 --> 0:42:11,76
and from there to Einstein's
special theory of relativity.


620
0:42:11,76 --> 0:42:19,56
If you think the rainbow has poetic
mystery, you should try relativity.


621
0:42:19,56 --> 0:42:22,96
Science does the opposite
of making things banal.


622
0:42:22,96 --> 0:42:28,52
It's about unleashing curiosity and
uncovering more mysteries to solve.


623
0:42:28,52 --> 0:42:30,6
We take so much for granted,


624
0:42:30,6 --> 0:42:35,96
we've become anaesthetised by our
familiarity with what's around us.


625
0:42:35,96 --> 0:42:38,4
Science shakes off the anaesthetic


626
0:42:38,4 --> 0:42:43,48
and we look again
with new and clearer eyes.


627
0:42:43,48 --> 0:42:45,56
If you found
a bramble in your garden,


628
0:42:45,56 --> 0:42:47,8
you'd probably think it
an annoying weed.


629
0:42:47,8 --> 0:42:50,44
But like every other plant
and every other animal,


630
0:42:50,44 --> 0:42:53,88
it is an astonishing piece
of natural engineering.


631
0:42:53,88 --> 0:42:57,12
A leaf is a chemical factory.


632
0:42:57,12 --> 0:43:0,92
It's a flat-roofed factory and
on the flat roof are solar panels


633
0:43:0,92 --> 0:43:5,72
gathering sunlight to drive
the machinery of the factory.


634
0:43:5,72 --> 0:43:9,84
There are wheels, almost literally
wheels going round and round,


635
0:43:9,84 --> 0:43:11,48
biochemical wheels,


636
0:43:11,48 --> 0:43:13,48
driven by the energy from the sun


637
0:43:13,48 --> 0:43:18,4
and manufacturing food
for the plant - sugars.


638
0:43:18,4 --> 0:43:20,52
And the sugars are then piped


639
0:43:20,52 --> 0:43:23,6
in this, what almost
looks like a river system,


640
0:43:23,6 --> 0:43:25,72
into the central stem


641
0:43:25,72 --> 0:43:27,6
and into the rest of the plant.


642
0:43:27,6 --> 0:43:31,0
That's where all the food
for the plant comes from


643
0:43:31,0 --> 0:43:34,2
and even OUR food comes from that
because we eat plants,


644
0:43:34,2 --> 0:43:36,28
or we eat animals that eat plants,


645
0:43:36,28 --> 0:43:38,84
and so the energy
that drives our bodies,


646
0:43:38,84 --> 0:43:41,0
every one of our trillions of cells


647
0:43:41,0 --> 0:43:43,28
comes ultimately from the sun


648
0:43:43,28 --> 0:43:46,4
and it flows down a river system
like this


649
0:43:46,4 --> 0:43:49,12
ultimately into us.


650
0:43:49,12 --> 0:43:53,88
It gets even better - the genetic
code that's used by this plant


651
0:43:53,88 --> 0:43:57,52
is the same as the one
that's used by you.


652
0:43:57,52 --> 0:44:0,48
Even 50% of the genes are the same.


653
0:44:0,48 --> 0:44:3,88
This plant is your cousin.


654
0:44:3,88 --> 0:44:8,36
Just a weed?


655
0:44:8,36 --> 0:44:10,32
'Some people would say that


656
0:44:10,32 --> 0:44:14,48
'the scientific view is rather bleak
and cold. Do you find it bleak?'


657
0:44:14,48 --> 0:44:17,44
There's no God-fearing person
of any religion


658
0:44:17,44 --> 0:44:21,96
who...feels as much awe as me


659
0:44:21,96 --> 0:44:23,96
as when I see...


660
0:44:23,96 --> 0:44:26,8
a mountain or a tree.


661
0:44:26,8 --> 0:44:26,96
Or the stars.


662
0:44:26,96 --> 0:44:28,56
Or the stars.
Or the stars.


663
0:44:28,56 --> 0:44:30,8
Or, um...


664
0:44:30,8 --> 0:44:34,76
anything in science
and nature and art.


665
0:44:34,76 --> 0:44:37,4
And you and I are privileged
to be here to enjoy it,


666
0:44:37,4 --> 0:44:39,4
even if for a short time.


667
0:44:39,4 --> 0:44:41,32
That's a wonderful thought.


668
0:44:41,32 --> 0:44:45,2
We cherish this life.


669
0:44:45,2 --> 0:44:47,72
It's sacred...


670
0:44:47,72 --> 0:44:49,24
so enjoy it.


671
0:44:49,24 --> 0:44:52,8
This is all we've got
and it's brilliant.


672
0:44:52,8 --> 0:44:52,64
Make the most of it.


673
0:44:52,64 --> 0:44:53,68
Make the most of it.
It's brilliant!


674
0:44:53,68 --> 0:45:2,8
It's amazing!


675
0:45:2,8 --> 0:45:4,84
We are lucky to be born.


676
0:45:4,84 --> 0:45:8,24
We win the lottery
just in being here at all.


677
0:45:8,24 --> 0:45:11,76
Your unique identity
is the result of one sperm


678
0:45:11,76 --> 0:45:13,2
amongst hundreds of millions


679
0:45:13,2 --> 0:45:17,84
fertilising one particular egg
in one particular sexual exchange.


680
0:45:17,84 --> 0:45:21,28
And the same lucky break
had to favour your ancestors


681
0:45:21,28 --> 0:45:26,2
in every generation
back to the very beginning of life.


682
0:45:26,2 --> 0:45:31,4
And we are luckier still as
individuals to have been born NOW.


683
0:45:31,4 --> 0:45:32,84
We have so much available to us -


684
0:45:32,84 --> 0:45:36,12
possible only through
the understanding


685
0:45:36,12 --> 0:45:38,56
that science has already given us.


686
0:45:38,56 --> 0:45:42,4
Just look how far
we've come in my lifetime -


687
0:45:42,4 --> 0:45:46,32
we've got life-saving medicine,
super-computers, the internet.


688
0:45:46,32 --> 0:45:50,92
We can travel further and faster,
higher and deeper than ever before.


689
0:45:50,92 --> 0:45:56,36
We constantly push
at the frontiers of possibility.


690
0:45:56,36 --> 0:46:2,16
Imagine what's still to come!


691
0:46:2,16 --> 0:46:4,48
We are made by the laws of physics


692
0:46:4,48 --> 0:46:8,4
working through
four billion years of evolution.


693
0:46:8,4 --> 0:46:12,44
We have a brief window of life
through which to see the universe


694
0:46:12,44 --> 0:46:15,8
and understand
how we came to be in it.


695
0:46:15,8 --> 0:46:19,64
The truth may not always be
comforting in the face of suffering,


696
0:46:19,64 --> 0:46:23,12
but it has a majesty of its own.


697
0:46:23,12 --> 0:46:25,48
That's what I tell people
when they ask me,


698
0:46:25,48 --> 0:48:25,48
"Why do you bother
to get up in the mornings?"
