we cope better than average

Well, for fuck's sake,
we live in Manchester,

"The same" lasts.

You've just had a couple of lines

Baking soda. Aspirin. Let's go home.

OK, if that's what you want.


56
0:3:54,26 --> 0:3:59,58

It's a social responsibility.

0:4:9,94 --> 0:4:10,941
It's a free lunch.


62
0:4:10,941 --> 0:4:15,22
It's a buzz. You never know
what's going to happen at a funeral...


63
0:4:15,22 --> 0:4:20,22
all that pent-up frustration and
years of resentment and bitterness,


64
0:4:20,22 --> 0:4:23,66
the Yin and Yang
of familial love and hate.

You're very strange, Mrs Croker,
if you don't mind me saying.


66
0:4:26,3 --> 0:4:28,98
I consider it a compliment.


67
0:4:28,98 --> 0:4:32,42
Looking well, both.


68
0:4:32,42 --> 0:4:33,42
Thank you.


69
0:4:33,42 --> 0:4:34,101
Considering.


70
0:4:34,101 --> 0:4:36,22
Yeah, Lillian, we get the message.


71
0:4:36,22 --> 0:4:40,22
Time to make tracks. Got to get there
early if we want a decent seat.


72
0:4:40,22 --> 0:4:41,42
She's keen.


73
0:4:41,42 --> 0:4:43,98

was a close personal friend.

0:4:48,78 --> 0:4:51,5

0:4:51,5 --> 0:4:53,581
Everyone keeps banging on
about how well we're doing.

Well, we are.

79
0:5:0,18 --> 0:5:2,62
You said it'd take years off.


80
0:5:2,62 --> 0:5:6,5
Er, hairdresser,
not a supplier of miracles.


81
0:5:6,5 --> 0:5:9,58
Could get a little work done.
Not uncommon these days.


82
0:5:9,58 --> 0:5:11,86
Upstairs or down?


83
0:5:11,86 --> 0:5:15,62
Er, downstairs is as good as new,
thank you very much.


84
0:5:15,62 --> 0:5:18,14
Me and me mister are hand in glove.


85
0:5:18,14 --> 0:5:22,5
I only ask cos the older woman
sometimes has a lift down below.


86
0:5:22,5 --> 0:5:24,58
Tightens things up
for the new tenant.


87
0:5:24,58 --> 0:5:28,7

You've gotta love the Cougars.


88

You mean all those girls had the...


89
0:5:30,74 --> 0:5:33,3
God, no!
Liz couldn't, not with her back.


90
0:5:33,3 --> 0:5:34,98
And the fact she is dead.


91
0:5:34,98 --> 0:5:36,21
Oh, sorry, and there is that.


92
0:5:36,21 --> 0:5:38,18
And when they did Joany,


93
0:5:38,18 --> 0:5:41,18
they made a little person
from the excess,


94
0:5:41,18 --> 0:5:44,34
and that's how we've got
Simon Cowell.


95
0:5:44,34 --> 0:5:46,26
What d'you think I'd need?


96
0:5:46,26 --> 0:5:47,94
A head transplant.


97
0:5:47,94 --> 0:5:52,22
Enough with the fucking wisecracks.
I'm serious here.


98
0:5:52,22 --> 0:5:56,98
About cosmetic surgery?
You're in your prime, Meems.


99
0:5:56,98 --> 0:5:58,58
I'm gonna lose him.


100
0:5:58,58 --> 0:6:1,2
Maybe not now, but sometime.


101
0:6:1,2 --> 0:6:1,661
What's he done?


102
0:6:1,661 --> 0:6:2,74
Who?


103
0:6:2,74 --> 0:6:4,82
Billy.
Nothing!


104
0:6:4,82 --> 0:6:6,581
If that little fucker
is dipping his wick, I'll...


105
0:6:6,581 --> 0:6:9,38
He isn't. He hasn't done anything.


106
0:6:9,38 --> 0:6:12,46
It's not him, it's me.


107
0:6:12,46 --> 0:6:20,66
I can't be everything he needs.


108
0:6:20,66 --> 0:6:23,38
These sandwiches taste of feet.


109
0:6:23,38 --> 0:6:24,98
Anyone for a top-up?


110
0:6:24,98 --> 0:6:28,3
Oh, no, thank you.
No, I really couldn't.


111
0:6:28,3 --> 0:6:31,26
Any more sherry,
I'll be shitting doilies.


112
0:6:31,26 --> 0:6:36,42
I'll have some.

0:6:36,42 --> 0:6:37,94
Incoming at nine o'clock.


114
0:6:37,94 --> 0:6:41,94
Insurance salesman, I'm thinking,
or ambulance chaser.


115
0:6:41,94 --> 0:6:44,18
We might get a free pen.


116
0:6:44,18 --> 0:6:46,46
Afternoon, ladies.
Thank you for coming.


117
0:6:46,46 --> 0:6:47,501
Wouldn't miss it for the world.


118
0:6:47,501 --> 0:6:48,9
Indeed.


119
0:6:48,9 --> 0:6:50,3
Did you know Irene well?


120
0:6:50,3 --> 0:6:53,26
Oh, very close, we were, at one time.


121
0:6:53,26 --> 0:6:54,7
Who's Irene?


122
0:6:54,7 --> 0:7:1,14
The lady who passed away
so tragically.


123
0:7:1,14 --> 0:7:2,261
So, when were you close?


124
0:7:2,261 --> 0:7:4,62
Back in the day, in the '60s.


125
0:7:4,62 --> 0:7:5,901
Too long ago to remember.


126
0:7:5,901 --> 0:7:11,98
No, please, do try. It's wonderful
meeting people who knew my mum.


127
0:7:11,98 --> 0:7:13,9
Your mum?


128
0:7:13,9 --> 0:7:15,18
Oh, well...


129
0:7:15,18 --> 0:7:18,26
Er, she loved travel, your mother.


130
0:7:18,26 --> 0:7:20,98
She did, especially in the '60s.


131
0:7:20,98 --> 0:7:22,74
We travelled together...


132
0:7:22,74 --> 0:7:24,38
all over,


133
0:7:24,38 --> 0:7:27,74
across Europe, North America...


134
0:7:27,74 --> 0:7:29,98
I hope you don't mind,


135
0:7:29,98 --> 0:7:33,34
but since we only brought my mother
back from Austria yesterday,


136
0:7:33,34 --> 0:7:34,94
would you mind saying a few words?


137
0:7:34,94 --> 0:7:39,74
No! That's something
you should do, surely.


138
0:7:39,74 --> 0:7:43,54
Well, she left when I was two. She
only got back in touch last year.


139
0:7:43,54 --> 0:7:47,78
Someone like you
could say so much more.


140
0:7:47,78 --> 0:7:50,42
Oh!


141
0:7:50,42 --> 0:7:53,1
Thanks.


142
0:7:53,1 --> 0:8:0,6
MIC FEEDS BACK


143
0:8:0,6 --> 0:8:2,66
I knew Irene, of course.


144
0:8:2,66 --> 0:8:6,34
(LAUGHS) Why wouldn't I?


145
0:8:6,34 --> 0:8:8,74
A kind woman.


146
0:8:8,74 --> 0:8:11,66
A good woman.


147
0:8:11,66 --> 0:8:17,42
Churchgoing till the end.


148
0:8:17,42 --> 0:8:25,54
Jewish, of course,
which is still a religion.


149
0:8:25,54 --> 0:8:30,58
We were together at...


150
0:8:30,58 --> 0:8:32,74
the Prague Spring.


151
0:8:32,74 --> 0:8:40,1
Oh, yes, facing down
the might of the Soviet Empire.


152
0:8:40,1 --> 0:8:42,38
And then, of course...


153
0:8:42,38 --> 0:8:44,6
there was Woodstock!


154
0:8:44,6 --> 0:9:2,9
GENIAL LAUGHTER


155
0:9:2,9 --> 0:9:4,22
Mm, summat smells good!


156
0:9:4,22 --> 0:9:5,98
Your favourite.


157
0:9:5,98 --> 0:9:7,54
Shepherd's pie?


158
0:9:7,54 --> 0:9:10,1
Your second-favourite.


159
0:9:10,1 --> 0:9:11,14
Oh, curry!


160
0:9:11,14 --> 0:9:12,66
Pizza.


161
0:9:12,66 --> 0:9:17,46
Sweet.


162
0:9:17,46 --> 0:9:22,78
I thought we could have a quiet
night in, the two of us and a film.


163
0:9:22,78 --> 0:9:25,26
(LAUGHS)


164
0:9:25,26 --> 0:9:26,621
I thought you were being serious
for a minute.


165
0:9:26,621 --> 0:9:30,6
I am.


166
0:9:30,6 --> 0:9:32,3
Oh, right. Yeah, I'd love to.


167
0:9:32,3 --> 0:9:33,78
Can I ask you something?


168
0:9:33,78 --> 0:9:34,621
Fire away.


169
0:9:34,621 --> 0:9:37,1
What's your favourite book?


170
0:9:37,1 --> 0:9:39,2
Batman.


171
0:9:39,2 --> 0:9:41,141
If there was an election tomorrow,
who would you vote for?


172
0:9:41,141 --> 0:9:44,7
Nobody. Politics is boring.


173
0:9:44,7 --> 0:9:46,74
World events, and stuff?


174
0:9:46,74 --> 0:9:49,2
Makes me sleepy. I don't care.


175
0:9:49,2 --> 0:9:53,14
Oh, there's a dubstep all-nighter on
in town. I said we might go.


176
0:9:53,14 --> 0:9:56,38
You could go on your own. We don't
have to do everything together.


177
0:9:56,38 --> 0:10:0,78
But you said that's the secret
to a happy relationship.


178
0:10:0,78 --> 0:10:2,42
Maybe I was wrong.


179
0:10:2,42 --> 0:10:26,38
Go out, have a great time.


180
0:10:26,38 --> 0:10:27,501
Sorry. Did I wake you?


181
0:10:27,501 --> 0:10:29,94
No.


182
0:10:29,94 --> 0:10:30,981
Couldn't sleep.


183
0:10:30,981 --> 0:10:32,7
Is everything all right?


184
0:10:32,7 --> 0:10:35,26
Just me mind working overtime.


185
0:10:35,26 --> 0:10:36,82
Did you get off with anyone?


186
0:10:36,82 --> 0:10:38,54
What?!


187
0:10:38,54 --> 0:10:40,54
No, course not.
Did you?


188
0:10:40,54 --> 0:10:41,38
No!


189
0:10:41,38 --> 0:10:42,301
Kiss anyone?


190
0:10:42,301 --> 0:10:45,58
Fuck off. I wouldn't look at anyone!


191
0:10:45,58 --> 0:10:47,86
I think it's about time you did.


192
0:10:47,86 --> 0:11:0,264
What?!


193
0:11:0,264 --> 0:11:3,904
I'll keep it safe until your dad
comes back for it, yeah?


194
0:11:3,904 --> 0:11:7,104
No worries.


195
0:11:7,104 --> 0:11:9,465
Forty quid by the end of the week or
it'll be on eBay, understand?


196
0:11:9,465 --> 0:11:13,264
Sorted.


197
0:11:13,264 --> 0:11:14,824
So this friend...


198
0:11:14,824 --> 0:11:15,904
Of a friend.


199
0:11:15,904 --> 0:11:17,264
Friend of a friend.


200
0:11:17,264 --> 0:11:19,824
She wants him to shag around,
tells him to go for it?


201
0:11:19,824 --> 0:11:20,624
Yeah.


202
0:11:20,624 --> 0:11:24,64
It's every man's dream, innit,
having a bird pushing him


203
0:11:24,64 --> 0:11:38,144
to spread his seed? Fuck,
tell him to fill his boots!


204
0:11:38,144 --> 0:11:41,344
Of course, it means she's
splitting up with him.


205
0:11:41,344 --> 0:11:43,704
No, she wants them to stay together.


206
0:11:43,704 --> 0:11:46,704
She's dumping him. If your mate
can't see that, he's a muppet.


207
0:11:46,704 --> 0:12:0,24
Either that or she's already
doing someone herself.


208
0:12:0,24 --> 0:12:1,745
And the woman said,
"Shall I get you a priest?"


209
0:12:1,745 --> 0:12:3,824
The little lad,
wiping away his tears says,


210
0:12:3,824 --> 0:12:11,264
"No! Sex is the last thing
on my mind!"


211
0:12:11,264 --> 0:12:14,944
I hope that's a fucking money tree.
We could do wi' one!


212
0:12:14,944 --> 0:12:21,584
It's a cherry. I thought we could
plant it together in memory of...


213
0:12:21,584 --> 0:12:24,824
We'd have somewhere
we could go to think of her.


214
0:12:24,824 --> 0:12:32,104
Oh, for fuck's sake.


215
0:12:32,104 --> 0:12:33,464
There's your pal's lad.


216
0:12:33,464 --> 0:12:35,464
Oh, crap.


217
0:12:35,464 --> 0:12:40,544
Hello, ladies, I hope you don't
mind. I tried a few places.


218
0:12:40,544 --> 0:12:42,904
Nice work, Sherlock.


219
0:12:42,904 --> 0:12:46,144
It's just... I've
so many questions about my mother.


220
0:12:46,144 --> 0:12:48,584
My memory's not what it was.


221
0:12:48,584 --> 0:12:49,505
Any scraps from the table.


222
0:12:49,505 --> 0:12:52,944
From what I can gather,
she did do Paul McCartney,


223
0:12:52,944 --> 0:12:58,464
but Bobby Charlton is just a rumour.


224
0:12:58,464 --> 0:13:0,545
A bottle of pale ale as well.
That's really good.


225
0:13:0,545 --> 0:13:4,24
And it's good for you, full of iron.


226
0:13:4,24 --> 0:13:5,264
I'm not sure.


227
0:13:5,264 --> 0:13:6,263
I didn't like it at first...


228
0:13:6,263 --> 0:13:7,503
Fuck's going on?!


229
0:13:7,503 --> 0:13:8,503
All right, Billy?


230
0:13:8,503 --> 0:13:10,105
Is it him? Are you doing him?
Is that what this is about?


231
0:13:10,105 --> 0:13:11,544
What are you on about?


232
0:13:11,544 --> 0:13:13,64
I'm not fucking having it!


233
0:13:13,64 --> 0:13:14,105
Calm yourself, fella.


234
0:13:14,105 --> 0:13:17,184
Aaah!
Fuck, I think I've broke me hand!


235
0:13:17,184 --> 0:13:18,704
Are you all right?


236
0:13:18,704 --> 0:13:19,985
Stop talking to him!


237
0:13:19,985 --> 0:13:23,584
Shut the fuck up, you,
you're an embarrassment.


238
0:13:23,584 --> 0:13:37,184
I'm so sorry about this.


239
0:13:37,184 --> 0:13:40,784
I'm only trying to do what's right,
you know.


240
0:13:40,784 --> 0:13:42,105
I can't pretend it never happened.


241
0:13:42,105 --> 0:13:50,544
And I won't live every
day like it just has.


242
0:13:50,544 --> 0:13:57,624
Where the fuck are you going?!


243
0:13:57,624 --> 0:14:3,304
I was saving stuff,
putting a little bit aside,


244
0:14:3,304 --> 0:14:10,24
ever since the first scan.


245
0:14:10,24 --> 0:14:16,344
Nicked some copper wire from Maine
Road for this... and the snow suit.


246
0:14:16,344 --> 0:14:19,64
It's beautiful stuff.


247
0:14:19,64 --> 0:14:20,864
Quality gear. We could sell it?


248
0:14:20,864 --> 0:14:22,944
It's got to be
a hundred quid's worth.


249
0:14:22,944 --> 0:14:35,864
It's a night out
at the very least!


250
0:14:35,864 --> 0:14:39,104
I can't tell you what
a tonic this is.


251
0:14:39,104 --> 0:14:40,544
Yes.


252
0:14:40,544 --> 0:14:42,744
You see, I always hated her
for abandoning us,


253
0:14:42,744 --> 0:14:47,864
for what she did to my father...
but you paint a picture of a woman


254
0:14:47,864 --> 0:14:50,624
who was living life to the full.


255
0:14:50,624 --> 0:14:57,464
I really do now have to be going.
Thank you, goodbye.


256
0:14:57,464 --> 0:15:0,24
It makes me feel somehow
better about it...


257
0:15:0,24 --> 0:15:2,824
inheriting money from
a woman I barely knew,


258
0:15:2,824 --> 0:15:7,64
a houseful of possessions...


259
0:15:7,64 --> 0:15:11,304
Perhaps I could stay
for just one more.


260
0:15:11,304 --> 0:15:19,464
There's so much to tell.


261
0:15:19,464 --> 0:15:24,784
Does that make you feel better?


262
0:15:24,784 --> 0:15:27,664
What goes on in your head?


263
0:15:27,664 --> 0:15:30,744
Are you having an affair?
D'you want shot of me?


264
0:15:30,744 --> 0:15:33,704
No. And no.


265
0:15:33,704 --> 0:15:39,664
What's going on, then?


266
0:15:39,664 --> 0:15:42,944
I'm struggling to see the common
ground, baby. It worries me.


267
0:15:42,944 --> 0:15:44,184
Common ground?


268
0:15:44,184 --> 0:15:45,304
I mean like...


269
0:15:45,304 --> 0:15:46,944
I know what it means.


270
0:15:46,944 --> 0:15:51,424
I like Batman, I like all graphic
novels. They're... works of art.


271
0:15:51,424 --> 0:15:55,744
And I wouldn't vote in the election
cos politics is bollocks.


272
0:15:55,744 --> 0:15:58,424
It's all bought and paid
for in advance.


273
0:15:58,424 --> 0:16:1,304
You vote for whatever cunt
offends you least.


274
0:16:1,304 --> 0:16:5,944
You think you'd married
a gimp or summat?


275
0:16:5,944 --> 0:16:14,64
I'm sorry if I offended you.
Doesn't change the problem, though.


276
0:16:14,64 --> 0:16:36,464
I'm going for a drink... on my own.


277
0:16:36,464 --> 0:16:37,864
Marty?


278
0:16:37,864 --> 0:16:44,864
I don't want another baby
wearing this stuff...


279
0:16:44,864 --> 0:16:46,224
Sorry...


280
0:16:46,224 --> 0:16:49,144
I just blurted it out.


281
0:16:49,144 --> 0:16:51,304
I thought a night out
would do us good.


282
0:16:51,304 --> 0:17:6,104
I'll get a sub off Lillian,
that'll see us right.


283
0:17:6,104 --> 0:17:12,864
Compliments on a postcard,
please, ladies.


284
0:17:12,864 --> 0:17:17,144
You don't think it's a bit OTT for a
job interview, I mean, at your age?


285
0:17:17,144 --> 0:17:19,944
Making the most of her assets.
Your dad's not earning,


286
0:17:19,944 --> 0:17:23,144
so it's down to your mum
to bring in the bacon.


287
0:17:23,144 --> 0:17:25,784
I am stuffed into this.
Too much...?


288
0:17:25,784 --> 0:17:31,224
Not enough, in my humble.
Designed to hypnotise, cleavage...


289
0:17:31,224 --> 0:17:34,584
it's what God intended.


290
0:17:34,584 --> 0:17:35,944
Too low?


291
0:17:35,944 --> 0:17:37,864
If I was a fella...


292
0:17:37,864 --> 0:17:40,704
I'd ride you. Don't know
if I'd give you a job,


293
0:17:40,704 --> 0:17:47,24
but I would definitely ride you.


294
0:17:47,24 --> 0:17:49,144
What are you so nervous about?


295
0:17:49,144 --> 0:17:52,784
I hate job interviews.
I get all sweaty, I crumble.


296
0:17:52,784 --> 0:17:54,24
You're smart.


297
0:17:54,24 --> 0:17:56,944
Not when people are judging me,
looking at me.


298
0:17:56,944 --> 0:17:59,704
Hate it, always have done.


299
0:17:59,704 --> 0:18:1,584
Right. What's the damage?


300
0:18:1,584 --> 0:18:4,504
Oh, it'll save
until you get your first pay packet.


301
0:18:4,504 --> 0:18:5,943
You'll do it just like this
tomorrow?


302
0:18:5,943 --> 0:18:8,145
I'll have you skipping
down the street to that interview,


303
0:18:8,145 --> 0:18:10,144
looking a million dollars.


304
0:18:10,144 --> 0:18:14,784
Right! Best get out of this,
hang it up.


305
0:18:14,784 --> 0:18:42,424
Get off!


306
0:18:42,424 --> 0:18:47,304
Some guys don't like how
their missus looks in the morning,


307
0:18:47,304 --> 0:18:50,864
but I love it ... little puffy eyes,
adjusting, like a little chipmunk.


308
0:18:50,864 --> 0:18:56,224
I can suck a banana right
out of its skin, no hands.


309
0:18:56,224 --> 0:18:58,304
Hello, Daddy.


310
0:18:58,304 --> 0:19:2,224
She was dry-humping him
like a horny schoolie!


311
0:19:2,224 --> 0:19:3,305
She is a horny schoolie!


312
0:19:3,305 --> 0:19:4,704
Is there any other kind?


313
0:19:4,704 --> 0:19:7,224
I don't see what's so funny here.


314
0:19:7,224 --> 0:19:10,224
Your brand-new
out-of-the-box husband


315
0:19:10,224 --> 0:19:12,584
was firing into another woman.


316
0:19:12,584 --> 0:19:13,944
I told him to.


317
0:19:13,944 --> 0:19:17,704
I was gonna take a fucking
drill to his head,


318
0:19:17,704 --> 0:19:19,384
but I thought, "No, you know what?


319
0:19:19,384 --> 0:19:21,624
"You might want..."
What did you just say?


320
0:19:21,624 --> 0:19:24,504
I told him to. It was my idea.


321
0:19:24,504 --> 0:19:26,624
It's true,
I don't understand either,


322
0:19:26,624 --> 0:19:29,784
so don't ask. I don't want it.


323
0:19:29,784 --> 0:19:33,864
I want us to see other people.
I want an open relationship.


324
0:19:33,864 --> 0:19:35,23
It's not right.


325
0:19:35,23 --> 0:19:37,424
It's disgusting.


326
0:19:37,424 --> 0:19:40,224
I think it's a great idea.


327
0:19:40,224 --> 0:19:43,784
Excellent,
enter the Daily fucking Bugle.


328
0:19:43,784 --> 0:19:46,624
Don't it make you feel
guilty about what you're doing?


329
0:19:46,624 --> 0:19:49,784
Not a bit. I've earned it.


330
0:19:49,784 --> 0:19:50,585
You're taking his
inheritance off him.


331
0:19:50,585 --> 0:19:53,144
He won't miss something
he's never had.


332
0:19:53,144 --> 0:19:55,625
And if he gets some
relief from knowing that his mother


333
0:19:55,625 --> 0:20:0,344
didn't entirely hate him, may even
have had some affection for him,


334
0:20:0,344 --> 0:20:1,864
I'd say it's money well spent.


335
0:20:1,864 --> 0:20:4,784
You're meant to be setting an
example, we're impressionable.


336
0:20:4,784 --> 0:20:9,224
You are a bollocks. You haven't been
impressionable since you bought


337
0:20:9,224 --> 0:20:13,784
your first pack of
20 king size, aged seven.


338
0:20:13,784 --> 0:20:18,504
And her ... you can act
like Lady Muck all you please.


339
0:20:18,504 --> 0:20:22,664
You have pram-face
written all over you.


340
0:20:22,664 --> 0:20:28,24
You really are horrible.


341
0:20:28,24 --> 0:20:32,304
My advice to you is watch and learn.


342
0:20:32,304 --> 0:20:38,784
You won't always be jail-bait
and then what'll you do?


343
0:20:38,784 --> 0:20:42,864
# The best things in life are free


344
0:20:42,864 --> 0:20:45,224
# But you can give them
to the birds and bees


345
0:20:45,224 --> 0:20:48,424
# I want money


346
0:20:48,424 --> 0:20:51,944
# That's what I want


347
0:20:51,944 --> 0:20:56,64
# That's what I want


348
0:20:56,64 --> 0:21:0,784
# That's what I want


349
0:21:0,784 --> 0:21:5,584
# Your love gives me
such a thrill... #


350
0:21:5,584 --> 0:21:6,945
I thought we were going into town.


351
0:21:6,945 --> 0:21:11,144
We are, yeah, just a little livener,
a swift voddie to line us guts.


352
0:21:11,144 --> 0:21:12,984
Just you and me?


353
0:21:12,984 --> 0:21:19,424
Cross me heart.


354
0:21:19,424 --> 0:21:21,704
Cheer up. We'll have a great night.


355
0:21:21,704 --> 0:21:23,663
It's been ages
since we've all been out together.


356
0:21:23,663 --> 0:21:24,505
Sure you're all right
with this, mate?


357
0:21:24,505 --> 0:21:26,264
Yeah. Course.


358
0:21:26,264 --> 0:21:28,584
Got to admire the girl,
she's doing great.


359
0:21:28,584 --> 0:21:30,784
Yeah.


360
0:21:30,784 --> 0:21:35,584
Oh, Manchester! Is wonderful!
Oh, Manchester is wonderful!


361
0:21:35,584 --> 0:21:41,504
THEY SHOUT AND CHANT


362
0:21:41,504 --> 0:21:42,984
I'm forward planning.


363
0:21:42,984 --> 0:21:46,144
I'm being proactive to nip future
problems in the bud.


364
0:21:46,144 --> 0:21:47,504
What future problems?


365
0:21:47,504 --> 0:21:49,784
There's a quarter of a century
between us.


366
0:21:49,784 --> 0:21:52,784
I don't want to be looking
over my shoulder all the time,


367
0:21:52,784 --> 0:21:54,625
waiting for that to bite me
on the arse.


368
0:21:54,625 --> 0:21:57,584
And the solution is for him
to shag other women?


369
0:21:57,584 --> 0:22:1,384
Amongst other things.
I can't be "all women" to Billy,


370
0:22:1,384 --> 0:22:3,984
and it'd be humiliating to try.


371
0:22:3,984 --> 0:22:9,64
There's stuff in his life where
I don't fit in, and vice versa.


372
0:22:9,64 --> 0:22:12,584
Now that is a very healthy attitude.


373
0:22:12,584 --> 0:22:13,984
I mean, people just...


374
0:22:13,984 --> 0:22:21,144
They get hung up about sex.
It gets in the way of everything.


375
0:22:21,144 --> 0:22:22,225
What the fuck's that for?


376
0:22:22,225 --> 0:22:25,64
Cos I can't fucking slap her.


377
0:22:25,64 --> 0:22:27,64
And that's where you come in, son.


378
0:22:27,64 --> 0:22:31,24
He's reluctant, and you're my son
and I trust you.


379
0:22:31,24 --> 0:22:34,264
And that's why I want you
to take your stepfather out


380
0:22:34,264 --> 0:22:35,704
and get him laid.


381
0:22:35,704 --> 0:22:38,824
And there is a sentence
I never thought I'd hear


382
0:22:38,824 --> 0:22:42,944
when I woke up this morning.


383
0:22:42,944 --> 0:22:45,464
Sorry ... I'll slow up.


384
0:22:45,464 --> 0:22:47,264
You do realise, don't you?


385
0:22:47,264 --> 0:22:50,584
There's not a court in this land
that'd convict,


386
0:22:50,584 --> 0:22:52,785
if I chopped the fucking
lot of you up right now.


387
0:22:52,785 --> 0:22:55,304
Please, son.


388
0:22:55,304 --> 0:22:56,464
I'll do it.


389
0:22:56,464 --> 0:22:58,464
I'll do it on one condition.


390
0:22:58,464 --> 0:23:6,584
You do it too.

392
0:23:12,64 --> 0:23:15,344
Here you are ... what about her?


393
0:23:15,344 --> 0:23:18,264
Too obvious.


394
0:23:18,264 --> 0:23:19,904
All right ... her?


395
0:23:19,904 --> 0:23:21,984
She's taller than I am.


396
0:23:21,984 --> 0:23:23,224
Her?


397
0:23:23,224 --> 0:23:25,504
She's got an Adam's Apple!


398
0:23:25,504 --> 0:23:28,864
I don't care if it's a one-legged,
Geordie, fucking dwarf


399
0:23:28,864 --> 0:23:30,984
with a glass eye and a ginger beard.


400
0:23:30,984 --> 0:23:32,504
I don't care if it's a bloke.


401
0:23:32,504 --> 0:23:35,464
You're shagging someone tonight.
Who do you wanna ride?


402
0:23:35,464 --> 0:23:40,784
I wanna ride your mum.


403
0:23:40,784 --> 0:23:42,864
I cannot get used to a world


404
0:23:42,864 --> 0:23:51,584
where that is not an insult.

0:24:11,504 --> 0:24:12,584
Excuse me?


407
0:24:12,584 --> 0:24:24,984
Bum boys!


408
0:24:24,984 --> 0:24:26,984
It's not really what
I had in mind, this.


409
0:24:26,984 --> 0:24:29,424
Stop planning and start living.
Come on!


410
0:24:29,424 --> 0:24:31,184

Just fuck off!


414
0:24:35,264 --> 0:24:37,584
Don't start all that!


415
0:24:37,584 --> 0:24:38,944
I can't help it.


416
0:24:38,944 --> 0:24:41,984
Feeling all sorry for yourself.
Making it about you.


417
0:24:41,984 --> 0:24:43,864
I'm dealing with it.


418
0:24:43,864 --> 0:25:3,784
It's time you did.


419
0:25:3,784 --> 0:25:7,184
(MIMI) I hate these places.
Always feel like I stand out.


420
0:25:7,184 --> 0:25:10,864
Why blend in?
Where's the fun in that?


421
0:25:10,864 --> 0:25:12,384
It's all right for you...


422
0:25:12,384 --> 0:25:16,264
you always manage to pull off
the kind of casual-trampy look.


423
0:25:16,264 --> 0:25:18,504
I'm a bit more reserved.


424
0:25:18,504 --> 0:25:20,624
That's the word
that springs to mind...


425
0:25:20,624 --> 0:25:23,464
reserved(!)


426
0:25:23,464 --> 0:25:24,824
Oi!


427
0:25:24,824 --> 0:25:27,504
You're not a Catholic
schoolgirl nowadays.


428
0:25:27,504 --> 0:25:29,984
You need to flaunt the goodies.


429
0:25:29,984 --> 0:25:33,464
Well, hello!


430
0:25:33,464 --> 0:25:37,344
I haven't done this
in fucking years.


431
0:25:37,344 --> 0:25:39,225
Now, listen ... don't get carried away


432
0:25:39,225 --> 0:25:42,184
if you get a lot of attention
early on, all right?


433
0:25:42,184 --> 0:25:44,784
Course. Why?


434
0:25:44,784 --> 0:25:47,664
To avoid disappointment.


435
0:25:47,664 --> 0:25:52,344
Some of them might be
chatting you up... strategically.


436
0:25:52,344 --> 0:25:54,864
Are you saying I'm the ugly mate?


437
0:25:54,864 --> 0:25:58,704
No! Just... be realistic.


438
0:25:58,704 --> 0:26:0,864
I will.


439
0:26:0,864 --> 0:26:2,584
Realistically, a woman your age


440
0:26:2,584 --> 0:26:5,504
shouldn't try to get away
with wearing a dress like that.


441
0:26:5,504 --> 0:26:21,664
You look like a turkey
stuffed in a stocking.


442
0:26:21,664 --> 0:26:25,64
Thank you for a lovely meal.


443
0:26:25,64 --> 0:26:26,944
The pleasure was all mine.


444
0:26:26,944 --> 0:26:29,784
I'll see you tomorrow
for the reading of the will?


445
0:26:29,784 --> 0:26:31,304
You must think I'm pathetic.


446
0:26:31,304 --> 0:26:35,24
A man my age,
all curious about his mother.


447
0:26:35,24 --> 0:26:36,985
We all want to know
from whence we came.


448
0:26:36,985 --> 0:26:39,24
Talking to you helps me
understand her.


449
0:26:39,24 --> 0:26:43,464
Why she did the things she did.


450
0:26:43,464 --> 0:26:45,944
Could I stay?


451
0:26:45,944 --> 0:26:47,64
Sorry?


452
0:26:47,64 --> 0:26:49,144
Please?


453
0:26:49,144 --> 0:26:51,144
Or you could stay at mine.


454
0:26:51,144 --> 0:26:54,304
I just want to be with you,
that's all. It's like part of her.


455
0:26:54,304 --> 0:26:57,784
No, not tonight.


456
0:26:57,784 --> 0:26:59,905
I never had a mother.
You don't know what


457
0:26:59,905 --> 0:27:2,24
that's like ... to find her,
then lose her again.


458
0:27:2,24 --> 0:27:6,784
Yes, I'm sure Walt Disney will be
making a film about it very soon,


459
0:27:6,784 --> 0:27:10,64
but I have heard enough. Thank you.


460
0:27:10,64 --> 0:27:24,744
I'd like you to leave.


461
0:27:24,744 --> 0:27:28,584
I have them every other weekend.
I'm on really good terms with my ex.


462
0:27:28,584 --> 0:27:32,104
The divorce must
have been awful for you.


463
0:27:32,104 --> 0:27:34,424
Yeah, not the best.


464
0:27:34,424 --> 0:27:38,504
You OK there, Mimi?


465
0:27:38,504 --> 0:27:40,104
Yeah, great.


466
0:27:40,104 --> 0:27:41,865
There's got to be
a dance floor in here somewhere.


467
0:27:41,865 --> 0:27:43,864
Yeah, up the stairs.


468
0:27:43,864 --> 0:27:45,624
I fancy throwing some shapes.


469
0:27:45,624 --> 0:27:47,904
I'm sure there'll be
a line-up of guys


470
0:27:47,904 --> 0:27:50,344
can't wait to get
on the floor with you.


471
0:27:50,344 --> 0:27:53,384
I'll stay here with Mimi.
..If that's OK with you?


472
0:27:53,384 --> 0:27:55,64
Sound.


473
0:27:55,64 --> 0:28:2,584
Right, I'll get some more drinks in.


474
0:28:2,584 --> 0:28:5,464
Off you trot
to the dance floor, Turkey.


475
0:28:5,464 --> 0:28:7,584
Choosing you over me


476
0:28:7,584 --> 0:28:10,224
qualifies as a fetish.


477
0:28:10,224 --> 0:28:12,184
You know that, don't you?


478
0:28:12,184 --> 0:28:16,504
Gobble, gobble, gobble.


479
0:28:16,504 --> 0:28:20,144
I might just do that.


480
0:28:20,144 --> 0:28:22,424
Ha-ha!

I know what you're going through.


483
0:28:31,224 --> 0:28:33,744
Before Letitia finally
came along, we...


484
0:28:33,744 --> 0:28:38,784
It wasn't easy. Avril didn't
leave the house for weeks.


485
0:28:38,784 --> 0:28:40,25
Kelly seems to be coping OK, though.


486
0:28:40,25 --> 0:28:44,864
Well, she's not OK!
She's fucking not!


487
0:28:44,864 --> 0:28:49,24
Didn't mean anything.


488
0:28:49,24 --> 0:29:25,544
Get the fuck off her!


489
0:29:25,544 --> 0:29:27,24
Was that so bad?


490
0:29:27,24 --> 0:29:28,224
No.


491
0:29:28,224 --> 0:29:29,865
Do you need me to accompany
you to the bedroom?


492
0:29:29,865 --> 0:29:31,504
No.


493
0:29:31,504 --> 0:29:34,64
You can if you want.


494
0:29:34,64 --> 0:29:37,144
I don't think I could afford
the therapy, love.


495
0:29:37,144 --> 0:29:50,264
Just make sure you ride him good,
will you?


496
0:29:50,264 --> 0:29:52,264
God almighty!


497
0:29:52,264 --> 0:29:53,864
What's going on?


498
0:29:53,864 --> 0:29:55,584
Nothing.


499
0:29:55,584 --> 0:29:58,344
What are you doing here?!


500
0:29:58,344 --> 0:30:0,184
I wanted to see you sleeping.


501
0:30:0,184 --> 0:30:3,744
Why?


502
0:30:3,744 --> 0:30:5,584
I've done all right.


503
0:30:5,584 --> 0:30:7,984
I'm leading a decent life...


504
0:30:7,984 --> 0:30:11,584
good job, no wife yet,
but there's time.


505
0:30:11,584 --> 0:30:13,144
I'm proud of where I've got to.


506
0:30:13,144 --> 0:30:14,504
As you should be.


507
0:30:14,504 --> 0:30:17,424
I should be fucked up with
everything that was done to me.


508
0:30:17,424 --> 0:30:20,824
I need to know why she left.


509
0:30:20,824 --> 0:30:22,824
I need you to leave this house.


510
0:30:22,824 --> 0:30:24,824
I won't hurt you.


511
0:30:24,824 --> 0:30:26,664
Oh, I know that...


512
0:30:26,664 --> 0:30:34,224
but you have to go.


513
0:30:34,224 --> 0:30:44,184
Yeah.


514
0:30:44,184 --> 0:30:53,424
Cheers.


515
0:30:53,424 --> 0:30:55,24
Fuck me, you're a smooth one.


516
0:30:55,24 --> 0:30:59,704
Not really.


517
0:30:59,704 --> 0:31:2,344
Listen, I'm no expert.


518
0:31:2,344 --> 0:31:4,664
You only have to ask my ex-wives,


519
0:31:4,664 --> 0:31:11,744
but something's not right here.
What's going on?


520
0:31:11,744 --> 0:31:13,784
I'm married. Happily.


521
0:31:13,784 --> 0:31:17,864
You can't be that happy.


522
0:31:17,864 --> 0:31:21,104
We're trying an open relationship.


523
0:31:21,104 --> 0:31:22,25
So, this...


524
0:31:22,25 --> 0:31:23,784
Is the only thing I can think of


525
0:31:23,784 --> 0:31:26,225
to keep me and my fella together
in the long term.


526
0:31:26,225 --> 0:31:27,864
There's an age issue.


527
0:31:27,864 --> 0:31:30,424
I don't want it looming over us
in years to come.


528
0:31:30,424 --> 0:31:35,504
And you really don't want
to sleep with other men?


529
0:31:35,504 --> 0:31:38,344
We've both got to do it
or it won't work, you see?


530
0:31:38,344 --> 0:31:41,944
Bizarrely, I think I do.


531
0:31:41,944 --> 0:31:48,864
Pity ... I can peel a satsuma
with this tongue.

0:33:17,58 --> 0:33:18,78
What a night.


542
0:33:18,78 --> 0:33:21,34
I don't even remember
getting home, though.


543
0:33:21,34 --> 0:33:24,86
You woke the whole house,
needing money for the taxi!


544
0:33:24,86 --> 0:33:27,86
You owe me ten... £20!


545
0:33:27,86 --> 0:33:31,98
Jesus, what happened to you?!


546
0:33:31,98 --> 0:33:33,78
Oh, yeah, I remember now.

0:33:39,859 --> 0:33:43,34
What do you care?


550
0:33:43,34 --> 0:33:44,501
I don't, really.


551
0:33:44,501 --> 0:33:47,9
I used to think you were a victim
of circumstance


552
0:33:47,9 --> 0:33:51,18
and now I can see you're just stupid.


553
0:33:51,18 --> 0:33:54,58
Stupid?


554
0:33:54,58 --> 0:33:57,14
Like the bloke
whose grief you're ripping off?


555
0:33:57,14 --> 0:34:8,14
Got your mitts in the will yet?


556
0:34:8,14 --> 0:34:10,18
Doesn't look that bad.


557
0:34:10,18 --> 0:34:12,18
I'm a fucking peanut smuggler!


558
0:34:12,18 --> 0:34:15,54
You could hang your trilby off these.


559
0:34:15,54 --> 0:34:19,6
Oh, behave! I have breasts
and an arse and a muff.


560
0:34:19,6 --> 0:34:21,22
This shouldn't be news to you.


561
0:34:21,22 --> 0:34:23,74
In my first job,
it was considered a privilege


562
0:34:23,74 --> 0:34:26,74
to be bent over the boss's desk
for a spanking.


563
0:34:26,74 --> 0:34:29,5
Oh, the things that feminism's
robbed us of, eh?


564
0:34:29,5 --> 0:34:32,46
Though, if it had been a bloke
doing the interview,


565
0:34:32,46 --> 0:34:34,82
you'd be on Easy Street by now.


566
0:34:34,82 --> 0:34:36,781
Maybe you blew her away in the chat.


567
0:34:36,781 --> 0:34:42,14
Let me see... once we established
I had no relevant qualifications


568
0:34:42,14 --> 0:34:45,66
or experience to speak of ...
a subject we kept returning to...


569
0:34:45,66 --> 0:34:48,22
Why'd they have you in,
if you had nothing to offer?


570
0:34:48,22 --> 0:34:51,42
That's exactly what she said...


571
0:34:51,42 --> 0:34:53,86
"Precisely,
what do you have to offer?"


572
0:34:53,86 --> 0:34:57,18
Well... the thing is, I...


573
0:34:57,18 --> 0:34:58,981
What would you say
is your breast quality?


574
0:34:58,981 --> 0:35:0,14
Pardon?


575
0:35:0,14 --> 0:35:3,9
Your breast quality.


576
0:35:3,9 --> 0:35:7,34
My best quality? Just nipple.


577
0:35:7,34 --> 0:35:8,74
Oh, dear!


578
0:35:8,74 --> 0:35:10,6
How embarrassing.


579
0:35:10,6 --> 0:35:12,6
You think?


580
0:35:12,6 --> 0:35:17,22
Look, I'm good
and I'm fucking clever!


581
0:35:17,22 --> 0:35:19,9
But if paper-smart's what counts,


582
0:35:19,9 --> 0:35:29,58
there's a bucketful out
in the corridor fit the bill better.


583
0:35:29,58 --> 0:35:32,7
Look, there's plenty more jobs
in the sea.


584
0:35:32,7 --> 0:35:41,9
I look forward
to the ritual humiliation.


585
0:35:41,9 --> 0:35:45,42
PHONE RINGS


586
0:35:45,42 --> 0:35:50,5
Hello?


587
0:35:50,5 --> 0:35:51,54
Mum.


588
0:35:51,54 --> 0:35:53,86
Jesus! Me knickers
have hardly hit the floor!


589
0:35:53,86 --> 0:35:57,14
It's the hospital on the phone,
they're offering you the job.


590
0:35:57,14 --> 0:35:58,7
Fuck off, that's not funny!


591
0:35:58,7 --> 0:36:9,2
It's true.


592
0:36:9,2 --> 0:36:10,22
Hello?


593
0:36:10,22 --> 0:36:12,94
RADIO PLAYS IN BACKGROUND


594
0:36:12,94 --> 0:36:18,86
She said she admired my honesty...
plain speaking.


595
0:36:18,86 --> 0:36:21,5
You are... looking at...


596
0:36:21,5 --> 0:36:24,5
a trainee pharmacist assistant.


597
0:36:24,5 --> 0:36:26,2
Whoo-hoo! Cheers, Avril.


598
0:36:26,2 --> 0:36:27,82
Cheers, Avril. Well done, hon.


599
0:36:27,82 --> 0:36:30,62
You have got a job!


600
0:36:30,62 --> 0:36:33,98
Oh-ho!


601
0:36:33,98 --> 0:36:35,6
Morning.


602
0:36:35,6 --> 0:36:37,46
Don't, mate, honestly,
don't fucking talk to me.


603
0:36:37,46 --> 0:36:40,82
Me head is full up,
there's no more room.


604
0:36:40,82 --> 0:36:42,26
Thank you.


605
0:36:42,26 --> 0:36:46,98
My pleasure.


606
0:36:46,98 --> 0:36:48,2
You shag her?


607
0:36:48,2 --> 0:36:51,6
Yeah, all night.


608
0:36:51,6 --> 0:36:53,98
Inside out, and upside down.


609
0:36:53,98 --> 0:36:57,66
Come on! This is just getting
tasteless now.


610
0:36:57,66 --> 0:37:3,22
You really did it?


611
0:37:3,22 --> 0:37:5,34
I did it for us.


612
0:37:5,34 --> 0:37:7,26
You're a very lucky man. Fuck off!


613
0:37:7,26 --> 0:37:8,82
You?


614
0:37:8,82 --> 0:37:10,62
I shagged her.


615
0:37:10,62 --> 0:37:12,7
I haven't washed, to prove it.


616
0:37:12,7 --> 0:37:13,74
Oh, don't!


617
0:37:13,74 --> 0:37:16,78
I am fucking serious, right?!


618
0:37:16,78 --> 0:37:20,86
I can't take this any more.


619
0:37:20,86 --> 0:37:23,7
Not another fucking word!


620
0:37:23,7 --> 0:37:24,941
Did he try and pork you?


621
0:37:24,941 --> 0:37:29,9
You read about such things ...
folk have a fetish for the horrific.


622
0:37:29,9 --> 0:37:33,5
There was no porking ...
attempted or otherwise.


623
0:37:33,5 --> 0:37:35,9
Blackmail him... or call the cops.


624
0:37:35,9 --> 0:37:38,62
He's a paedophile.


625
0:37:38,62 --> 0:37:40,82
No...
the opposite of a paedophile.


626
0:37:40,82 --> 0:37:43,46
I can be unkind to you sometimes.


627
0:37:43,46 --> 0:37:45,74
But you are conclusive proof


628
0:37:45,74 --> 0:37:49,2
that modern culture
is rotting the brains of our youth.


629
0:37:49,2 --> 0:37:50,221
We could ask Jamie to sort him out.


630
0:37:50,221 --> 0:37:51,3
No!


631
0:37:51,3 --> 0:37:53,22
He's got something coming, love.


632
0:37:53,22 --> 0:38:7,34
You can't stroke a lady's hairnet
and get away with it.


633
0:38:7,34 --> 0:38:8,38
May I?


634
0:38:8,38 --> 0:38:15,78
Please.


635
0:38:15,78 --> 0:38:16,82
I'm sorry.


636
0:38:16,82 --> 0:38:18,38
No need.


637
0:38:18,38 --> 0:38:20,3
You have to understand that...


638
0:38:20,3 --> 0:38:24,18
I do. A mother's love is important.


639
0:38:24,18 --> 0:38:26,6
All those gobshites there think...


640
0:38:26,6 --> 0:38:29,94
I'm about to rip money
out of your pocket


641
0:38:29,94 --> 0:38:30,98
but I'm not.


642
0:38:30,98 --> 0:38:33,86
I couldn't give a monkey's fart
about the money.


643
0:38:33,86 --> 0:38:36,58
I'll tell you the truth
about your mother,


644
0:38:36,58 --> 0:38:38,7
if you promise to leave here
afterwards


645
0:38:38,7 --> 0:38:42,2
and never contact me again.


646
0:38:42,2 --> 0:38:44,6
OK.


647
0:38:44,6 --> 0:38:48,6
I have one further condition.


648
0:38:48,6 --> 0:38:53,74
You said your mammy had a house
full of possessions.


649
0:38:53,74 --> 0:38:55,701
There is one item
of sentimental value


650
0:38:55,701 --> 0:38:57,58
I would very much like to have.


651
0:38:57,58 --> 0:38:59,5
It's an album of photographs.


652
0:38:59,5 --> 0:39:2,22
Anything, I...


653
0:39:2,22 --> 0:39:6,14
I just need to know.


654
0:39:6,14 --> 0:39:10,7
Her name was Irene Felice O'Donnell.


655
0:39:10,7 --> 0:39:14,82
She was born
on the 22nd August 1939,


656
0:39:14,82 --> 0:39:19,42
not '42, as her birth certificate
would attest.


657
0:39:19,42 --> 0:39:23,66
She never loved your father.


658
0:39:23,66 --> 0:39:25,22
Whatever you may think of him,


659
0:39:25,22 --> 0:39:31,22
he wasn't a nice man ...
a bully, aggressive.


660
0:39:31,22 --> 0:39:39,58
She married him on the rebound
from the love of her life.


661
0:39:39,58 --> 0:39:46,98
That would be me.


662
0:39:46,98 --> 0:39:49,86
I consider my time with your mummy


663
0:39:49,86 --> 0:40:8,86
the best days I ever had.


664
0:40:8,86 --> 0:40:11,42
Rule one ... never stay the night.


665
0:40:11,42 --> 0:40:12,221
Quick shag, then home.


666
0:40:12,221 --> 0:40:13,3
Mm-hm.


667
0:40:13,3 --> 0:40:16,3
Two ... always, always wear a johnny.


668
0:40:16,3 --> 0:40:18,7
Nobody calls them johnnies any more.


669
0:40:18,7 --> 0:40:21,86
WOLF WHISTLING


670
0:40:21,86 --> 0:40:24,78
Three ... no shitting
on your own doorstep.


671
0:40:24,78 --> 0:40:27,6
I've suffered enough
local humiliation.


672
0:40:27,6 --> 0:40:28,98
No guys back to our marital bed...


673
0:40:28,98 --> 0:40:30,501
don't need those pictures
in my head.


674
0:40:30,501 --> 0:40:31,78
Fair enough.


675
0:40:31,78 --> 0:40:35,78
No-one over the age of 25...
I'm your personal MILF.


676
0:40:35,78 --> 0:40:39,78
(LAUGHS) No...one under the age
of 35 ... I'm your spunky, young lad.


677
0:40:39,78 --> 0:40:42,74
This might actually work, you know.
To be honest...


678
0:40:42,74 --> 0:40:44,38
I enjoyed it.


679
0:40:44,38 --> 0:40:45,221
BABY CRIES


680
0:40:45,221 --> 0:40:48,5
Oh! We've got a live one.


681
0:40:48,5 --> 0:40:50,22
(Come on, then.)


682
0:40:50,22 --> 0:40:58,42
Oh, ah!


683
0:40:58,42 --> 0:41:2,74
So, how was he, you old slapper?!


684
0:41:2,74 --> 0:41:6,86
What the fuck have I done, G?


685
0:41:6,86 --> 0:41:8,5
But I thought it was your idea.


686
0:41:8,5 --> 0:41:10,78
And it's the right idea.


687
0:41:10,78 --> 0:41:14,14
Doesn't make it any easier, though.


688
0:41:14,14 --> 0:41:21,98
I've not slept for 48 hours.


689
0:41:21,98 --> 0:41:26,78
# Through my sleepless days
I've found


690
0:41:26,78 --> 0:41:31,3
# That in my dreamless sleep
I'm bound


691
0:41:31,3 --> 0:41:35,98
# To one night hear the sound


692
0:41:35,98 --> 0:41:38,14
# Of you calling


693
0:41:38,14 --> 0:41:41,42
# Do not stumble through tonight


694
0:41:41,42 --> 0:41:48,6
# Have no fear of falling


695
0:41:48,6 --> 0:41:52,22
# And if nobody got lost


696
0:41:52,22 --> 0:41:55,5
# And if no-one paid the cost


697
0:41:55,5 --> 0:41:59,66
# The price of this, you may surmise


698
0:41:59,66 --> 0:42:2,86
# Is forever after


699
0:42:2,86 --> 0:42:7,58
# You won't stumble through tonight


700
0:42:7,58 --> 0:42:8,579
# Drowning in... #


701
0:42:8,579 --> 0:42:10,21
It's all right, I've got it.


702
0:42:10,21 --> 0:42:13,98
# You won't stumble through tonight


703
0:42:13,98 --> 0:42:20,5
# Drowning in their laughter. #


704
0:42:20,5 --> 0:42:25,6
This isn't what anyone
would have wanted...


705
0:42:25,6 --> 0:42:35,98
least of all me and Kelly.


706
0:42:35,98 --> 0:42:43,58
It's easy to look back and think how
things could have been different.


707
0:42:43,58 --> 0:42:48,58
But what's harder is to look forward
when something like this happens...


708
0:42:48,58 --> 0:42:53,6
cos it's hard to imagine a future.


709
0:42:53,6 --> 0:42:57,22
But we were blessed...


710
0:42:57,22 --> 0:43:0,98
me and Kelly were blessed.


711
0:43:0,98 --> 0:43:9,34
Our baby's name was Cherry Belle.


712
0:43:9,34 --> 0:43:24,6
She'll always be with us.


713
0:43:24,6 --> 0:43:25,42
Thank you.


714
0:43:25,42 --> 0:43:27,7
That's it now.


715
0:43:27,7 --> 0:43:32,42
It's time to...
stop grieving and start living.


716
0:43:32,42 --> 0:43:35,14
Where are you going?


717
0:43:35,14 --> 0:43:37,7
It's time I got back on the horse,
so to speak.


718
0:43:37,7 --> 0:43:39,86
I'm taking a shift at work.


719
0:43:39,86 --> 0:43:40,98
You can't.


720
0:43:40,98 --> 0:43:42,42
I mean...


721
0:43:42,42 --> 0:44:3,34
ain't it disrespectful...
to the baby?


722
0:44:3,34 --> 0:44:6,78
Oh, I'm shot to bits.


723
0:44:6,78 --> 0:44:8,98
So am I ... don't know if I'll last.


724
0:44:8,98 --> 0:44:10,42
Oh, come on, babe.


725
0:44:10,42 --> 0:44:13,7
I've been looking forward to this
all day.


726
0:44:13,7 --> 0:44:15,9
It's your chapter.


727
0:44:15,9 --> 0:44:17,42
Where did we stop?


728
0:44:17,42 --> 0:44:19,98
Sirius Black has escaped
from Azkaban,


729
0:44:19,98 --> 0:44:23,34
and Ron and Hermione
think he's coming after Harry.


730
0:44:23,34 --> 0:44:26,34
'They say that you get your reward
in heaven.


731
0:44:26,34 --> 0:44:28,98
'But they also say
that time waits for no man...


732
0:44:28,98 --> 0:44:37,5
'or woman.'


733
0:44:37,5 --> 0:44:39,981
'If you don't want to wait
until you get to heaven,


734
0:44:39,981 --> 0:44:54,34
'then you have to grab what you can,
when you can.'


735
0:44:54,34 --> 0:44:56,22
'We can't wait for others to fail


736
0:44:56,22 --> 0:44:58,98
'or for them to succeed
and give us what we need,


737
0:44:58,98 --> 0:45:2,6
'because our time here
can be so short


738
0:45:2,6 --> 0:45:6,5
'and we can't wait for the rest
of the world to catch up.


739
0:45:6,5 --> 0:45:9,14
'So if you're lucky
and if you work at it


740
0:45:9,14 --> 0:45:11,42
'and throw yourself into it


741
0:45:11,42 --> 0:45:13,5
'then you might, just might


742
0:45:13,5 --> 0:45:19,7
'get your reward,
right here on Earth.'


743
0:45:19,7 --> 0:45:20,781
I think I'm in love.


744
0:45:20,781 --> 0:45:22,22
Not the spaz?! Fuck off!


745
0:45:22,22 --> 0:45:24,221
Say you did shag a bird
in a wheeler, wouldn't it hurt?


746
0:45:24,221 --> 0:45:26,78
Maybe, if you let the brakes off!


747
0:45:26,78 --> 0:45:29,181
Don't want to be another lad.
I want to be your lad.


748
0:45:29,181 --> 0:45:31,14
Got anywhere to go? Want a Viagra?


749
0:45:31,14 --> 0:45:33,98
I never go anywhere
without my little bits.


750
0:45:33,98 --> 0:45:35,34
Outside.


751
0:45:35,34 --> 0:45:38,22
Can't we just do it in the... Oof!


752
0:45:38,22 --> 0:45:40,98
I'm your Auntie Angel.
Say hello to your auntie!


753
0:45:40,98 --> 0:45:42,78
Eww.


754
0:45:42,78 --> 0:45:46,34
I want to strap you onto me
and fuck you till your eyes water.

I'm so wet,
I might slip off me chair. Now!
