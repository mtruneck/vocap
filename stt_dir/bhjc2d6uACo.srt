1
0:0:1,33 --> 0:0:2,8
The President:
Hello, Johnson Controls!


2
0:0:2,8 --> 0:0:5,3
Audience:
Hello!


3
0:0:5,3 --> 0:0:8,233
The President:
It is good to be back
in Holland, Michigan.


4
0:0:8,233 --> 0:0:10,967
(applause)


5
0:0:10,967 --> 0:0:12,4
A couple people I want to thank.


6
0:0:12,4 --> 0:0:16,367
In particular, your CEO
Steve Roell is here.


7
0:0:16,367 --> 0:0:17,1
Steve.


8
0:0:17,1 --> 0:0:20,467
(applause)


9
0:0:20,467 --> 0:0:23,166
And sitting next to him, one of
my favorite people and one of


10
0:0:23,166 --> 0:0:24,834
the finest senators
in the country,


11
0:0:24,834 --> 0:0:26,0
Carl Levin is in the house.


12
0:0:26,0 --> 0:0:31,767
(applause)


13
0:0:31,767 --> 0:0:34,266
So I just had a chance to
see what you guys are doing


14
0:0:34,266 --> 0:0:35,8
in this plant.


15
0:0:35,8 --> 0:0:38,33
It is very impressive.


16
0:0:38,33 --> 0:0:39,567
Elizabeth was
giving me the tour,


17
0:0:39,567 --> 0:0:41,533
and she was very
patient with me,


18
0:0:41,533 --> 0:0:44,0
and I think I understood
about half of what she said.


19
0:0:44,0 --> 0:0:47,567
(laughter)


20
0:0:47,567 --> 0:0:54,367
At a time when Americans are
rightly focused on our economy,


21
0:0:54,367 --> 0:0:58,934
when Americans are asking
about what's our path forward,


22
0:0:58,934 --> 0:1:2,5
all of you here at Johnson
Controls are providing a


23
0:1:2,5 --> 0:1:4,667
powerful answer.


24
0:1:4,667 --> 0:1:10,0
This is one of the most advanced
factories in the world.


25
0:1:10,0 --> 0:1:15,6
You're helping America lead
in a growing new industry.


26
0:1:15,6 --> 0:1:19,33
You're showing us how we can
come back from the worst


27
0:1:19,33 --> 0:1:23,5
recession that we've had in
generations and start making


28
0:1:23,5 --> 0:1:29,6
things here in America that
are sold all around the world.


29
0:1:29,6 --> 0:1:32,233
And that's why I'm here today.


30
0:1:32,233 --> 0:1:35,9
I've said it before; I will say
it again: You cannot bet against


31
0:1:35,9 --> 0:1:37,433
the American worker.


32
0:1:37,433 --> 0:1:46,166
(applause)


33
0:1:46,166 --> 0:1:48,633
Don't bet against
American ingenuity.


34
0:1:48,633 --> 0:1:54,166
(applause)


35
0:1:54,166 --> 0:1:56,834
The reason a plant like this
exists is because we are a


36
0:1:56,834 --> 0:2:0,7
country of unmatched
freedom, where groundbreaking


37
0:2:0,7 --> 0:2:3,33
ideas flourish.


38
0:2:3,33 --> 0:2:5,367
We've got the finest
universities,


39
0:2:5,367 --> 0:2:8,667
the finest technical schools,
the most creative scientists,


40
0:2:8,667 --> 0:2:12,767
the best entrepreneurs -- all of
which is why we are home to the


41
0:2:12,767 --> 0:2:15,667
world's most dynamic and
successful businesses,


42
0:2:15,667 --> 0:2:17,66
large and small.


43
0:2:17,66 --> 0:2:25,66
(applause)


44
0:2:25,66 --> 0:2:29,33
And that's why even in
these difficult times,


45
0:2:29,33 --> 0:2:32,33
there is not a single country
on Earth that wouldn't trade


46
0:2:32,33 --> 0:2:33,6
places with us.


47
0:2:33,6 --> 0:2:35,266
Not one.


48
0:2:35,266 --> 0:2:38,7
We've got to remember that.


49
0:2:38,7 --> 0:2:42,7
But we also know that we face
some tough challenges right now.


50
0:2:42,7 --> 0:2:45,2
You know what they are.


51
0:2:45,2 --> 0:2:48,934
You live them every day
-- in your communities,


52
0:2:48,934 --> 0:2:50,3
in your families.


53
0:2:50,3 --> 0:2:53,233
You know too many people
who are out of work,


54
0:2:53,233 --> 0:2:59,1
or struggling to get by with
fewer shifts or fewer customers.


55
0:2:59,1 --> 0:3:1,7
Paychecks aren't big enough.


56
0:3:1,7 --> 0:3:4,5
Costs are too high.


57
0:3:4,5 --> 0:3:7,467
And even though the economy has
started growing again since the


58
0:3:7,467 --> 0:3:11,467
recession started in
2007, the fact is,


59
0:3:11,467 --> 0:3:15,667
it's not growing fast enough.


60
0:3:15,667 --> 0:3:20,233
Now, some of what we're facing
today has to do with events


61
0:3:20,233 --> 0:3:23,66
beyond our control.


62
0:3:23,66 --> 0:3:29,66
As the economy was improving and
improving through 2009, 2010,


63
0:3:29,66 --> 0:3:32,734
the beginning of this year,
suddenly it was hit with the


64
0:3:32,734 --> 0:3:35,767
unrest in the Middle East
that helped send gas prices


65
0:3:35,767 --> 0:3:38,633
through the roof.


66
0:3:38,633 --> 0:3:43,6
Europe is dealing with all sorts
of financial turmoil that is


67
0:3:43,6 --> 0:3:46,7
lapping up on our shores.


68
0:3:46,7 --> 0:3:50,6
Japan's tragic earthquake hurt
economies around the globe,


69
0:3:50,6 --> 0:3:53,533
including ours, cut off some
supply chains that were very


70
0:3:53,533 --> 0:3:56,33
important to us.


71
0:3:56,33 --> 0:4:1,333
And all of this has further
challenged our economy.


72
0:4:1,333 --> 0:4:5,367
And as we've seen, it's playing
out in the stock market,


73
0:4:5,367 --> 0:4:11,333
wild swings, up and down,
and it makes folks nervous,


74
0:4:11,333 --> 0:4:17,4
and it affects the savings of
families all across America.


75
0:4:17,4 --> 0:4:23,6
Now, challenges like these
-- earthquakes, revolutions --


76
0:4:23,6 --> 0:4:27,633
those are things
we can't control.


77
0:4:27,633 --> 0:4:32,834
But what we can control is our
response to these challenges.


78
0:4:32,834 --> 0:4:38,734
What we can control is
what happens in Washington.


79
0:4:38,734 --> 0:4:40,533
Unfortunately, what we've seen
in Washington the last few


80
0:4:40,533 --> 0:4:45,567
months has been the worst
kind of partisanship,


81
0:4:45,567 --> 0:4:49,8
the worst kind of gridlock --
and that gridlock has undermined


82
0:4:49,8 --> 0:4:53,533
public confidence and impeded
our efforts to take the steps we


83
0:4:53,533 --> 0:4:56,767
need for our economy.


84
0:4:56,767 --> 0:5:2,1
It's made things worse
instead of better.


85
0:5:2,1 --> 0:5:3,8
So what I want to say to
you, Johnson Controls,


86
0:5:3,8 --> 0:5:8,7
is: There is nothing
wrong with our country.


87
0:5:8,7 --> 0:5:10,767
There is something
wrong with our politics.


88
0:5:10,767 --> 0:5:19,6
(applause)


89
0:5:19,6 --> 0:5:25,467
There's something wrong with our
politics that we need to fix.


90
0:5:25,467 --> 0:5:29,133
We know there are things we can
do right now that will help


91
0:5:29,133 --> 0:5:33,133
accelerate growth
and job creation --


92
0:5:33,133 --> 0:5:37,767
that will support the work going
on here at Johnson Controls,


93
0:5:37,767 --> 0:5:40,1
here in Michigan, and
all across America.


94
0:5:40,1 --> 0:5:44,867
We can do some things right now
that will make a difference.


95
0:5:44,867 --> 0:5:50,2
We know there are things we have
to do to erase a legacy of debt


96
0:5:50,2 --> 0:5:54,266
that hangs over the economy.


97
0:5:54,266 --> 0:5:58,66
But time and again, we've seen
partisan brinksmanship get in


98
0:5:58,66 --> 0:6:1,9
the way -- as if winning the
next election is more important


99
0:6:1,9 --> 0:6:4,567
than fulfilling our
responsibilities to you and to


100
0:6:4,567 --> 0:6:9,266
our country.


101
0:6:9,266 --> 0:6:12,934
This downgrade you've been
reading about could have been


102
0:6:12,934 --> 0:6:17,667
entirely avoided if there had
been a willingness to compromise


103
0:6:17,667 --> 0:6:19,233
in Congress.


104
0:6:19,233 --> 0:6:27,7
(applause)


105
0:6:27,7 --> 0:6:31,166
See, it didn't happen because we
don't have the capacity to pay


106
0:6:31,166 --> 0:6:35,4
our bills -- it happened because
Washington doesn't have the


107
0:6:35,4 --> 0:6:38,934
capacity to come together
and get things done.


108
0:6:38,934 --> 0:6:40,567
It was a self-inflicted wound.


109
0:6:40,567 --> 0:6:45,467
(applause)


110
0:6:45,467 --> 0:6:48,834
That's why people
are frustrated.


111
0:6:48,834 --> 0:6:53,667
Maybe you hear it in my voice
-- that's why I'm frustrated.


112
0:6:53,667 --> 0:6:56,967
Because you deserve better.


113
0:6:56,967 --> 0:6:58,333
You guys deserve better.


114
0:6:58,333 --> 0:7:0,3
(applause)


115
0:7:0,3 --> 0:7:5,333
All of you, from the CEO
down, are working hard,


116
0:7:5,333 --> 0:7:9,433
taking care of your kids or
your parents -- maybe both.


117
0:7:9,433 --> 0:7:12,867
You're living within your means.


118
0:7:12,867 --> 0:7:16,33
You may be trying to save for
your child's college education


119
0:7:16,33 --> 0:7:17,734
or saving for retirement.


120
0:7:17,734 --> 0:7:20,767
You're donating to the
church or the food pantry.


121
0:7:20,767 --> 0:7:22,567
You're trying to
help the community.


122
0:7:22,567 --> 0:7:24,6
You're doing your part.


123
0:7:24,6 --> 0:7:28,934
You're living up to
your responsibilities.


124
0:7:28,934 --> 0:7:31,5
It's time for Washington
to do the same --


125
0:7:31,5 --> 0:7:33,834
to match your resolve,
and to match your decency,


126
0:7:33,834 --> 0:7:36,667
and to show the same sense
of honor and discipline.


127
0:7:36,667 --> 0:7:38,633
That is not too much to ask.


128
0:7:38,633 --> 0:7:40,767
That's what the American
people are looking for.


129
0:7:40,767 --> 0:7:51,66
(applause)


130
0:7:51,66 --> 0:7:55,767
And if that can happen,
we know what's possible.


131
0:7:55,767 --> 0:7:58,3
We know what we can achieve.


132
0:7:58,3 --> 0:8:1,2
Look at this factory.


133
0:8:1,2 --> 0:8:4,533
Look what's happening
in Holland, Michigan.


134
0:8:4,533 --> 0:8:7,834
Every day, hundreds of people
are going to work on the


135
0:8:7,834 --> 0:8:10,266
technologies that are helping
us to fight our way out of


136
0:8:10,266 --> 0:8:12,533
this recession.


137
0:8:12,533 --> 0:8:15,834
Every day, you're building
high-tech batteries so that we


138
0:8:15,834 --> 0:8:19,0
lead the world in
manufacturing the best cars and


139
0:8:19,0 --> 0:8:20,567
the best trucks.


140
0:8:20,567 --> 0:8:24,8
And that just doesn't
mean jobs in Michigan.


141
0:8:24,8 --> 0:8:28,6
You're buying equipment and
parts from suppliers in Florida


142
0:8:28,6 --> 0:8:31,934
and New Mexico and Ohio
and Wisconsin and all


143
0:8:31,934 --> 0:8:37,166
across America.


144
0:8:37,166 --> 0:8:41,367
So let's think about it --
what made this possible?


145
0:8:41,367 --> 0:8:46,967
The most important part is you:
your drive, your work ethic,


146
0:8:46,967 --> 0:8:50,633
your ingenuity, your management.


147
0:8:50,633 --> 0:8:54,467
The grit and optimism that says,
"We've got an idea for a new


148
0:8:54,467 --> 0:8:58,233
battery technology or a
new manufacturing process,


149
0:8:58,233 --> 0:8:59,8
and we're going to take that
leap and we're going to make


150
0:8:59,8 --> 0:9:0,867
an investment.


151
0:9:0,867 --> 0:9:1,9
And we're going to hire some
folks and we're going to


152
0:9:1,9 --> 0:9:5,0
see it through."


153
0:9:5,0 --> 0:9:8,7
That's what made it possible.


154
0:9:8,7 --> 0:9:13,934
But what also made this possible
are the actions that we took


155
0:9:13,934 --> 0:9:23,4
together, as a nation,
through our government --


156
0:9:23,4 --> 0:9:27,66
the fact that we were willing to
invest in the research and the


157
0:9:27,66 --> 0:9:32,467
technology that holds so much
promise for jobs and growth;


158
0:9:32,467 --> 0:9:36,633
the fact that we helped create
together the conditions where


159
0:9:36,633 --> 0:9:42,0
businesses like
this can prosper.


160
0:9:42,0 --> 0:9:46,633
That's why we're
investing in clean energy.


161
0:9:46,633 --> 0:9:48,834
That's why I brought together
the world's largest auto


162
0:9:48,834 --> 0:9:53,166
companies who agreed,
for the first time,


163
0:9:53,166 --> 0:9:56,567
to nearly double the distance
their cars can go on a


164
0:9:56,567 --> 0:9:57,967
gallon of gas.


165
0:9:57,967 --> 0:10:6,3
(applause)


166
0:10:6,3 --> 0:10:8,667
That's going to save
consumers thousands of dollars


167
0:10:8,667 --> 0:10:10,667
at the pump.


168
0:10:10,667 --> 0:10:13,867
It's going to cut our
dependence on foreign oil.


169
0:10:13,867 --> 0:10:15,633
It's going to promote
innovation and jobs,


170
0:10:15,633 --> 0:10:17,7
and it's going to mean more
groundbreakings and more jobs


171
0:10:17,7 --> 0:10:21,467
posting for companies
like Johnson Controls.


172
0:10:21,467 --> 0:10:24,66
And that's how America will
lead the world in automotive


173
0:10:24,66 --> 0:10:29,7
innovation and production
and exports in this country.


174
0:10:29,7 --> 0:10:30,266
Think about it.


175
0:10:30,266 --> 0:10:32,8
That's what we got
done -- and by the way,


176
0:10:32,8 --> 0:10:35,2
we didn't go through
Congress to do it.


177
0:10:35,2 --> 0:10:39,233
(laughter and applause)


178
0:10:39,233 --> 0:10:44,133
But we did use the
tools of government --


179
0:10:44,133 --> 0:10:49,66
us working together --
to help make it happen.


180
0:10:49,66 --> 0:10:52,834
Now, there are more steps that
we can take to help this economy


181
0:10:52,834 --> 0:10:55,333
growing faster.


182
0:10:55,333 --> 0:10:58,66
There are things we can do right
now that will put more money in


183
0:10:58,66 --> 0:11:2,66
your pockets; will help
businesses sell more products


184
0:11:2,66 --> 0:11:5,767
around the world; will put
people to work in Michigan and


185
0:11:5,767 --> 0:11:9,3
across the country.


186
0:11:9,3 --> 0:11:13,633
And to get these things
done, we do need Congress.


187
0:11:13,633 --> 0:11:17,0
They're common-sense ideas that
have been supported in the past


188
0:11:17,0 --> 0:11:21,734
by Democrats and Republicans,
things that are supported by


189
0:11:21,734 --> 0:11:24,2
Carl Levin.


190
0:11:24,2 --> 0:11:29,3
The only thing keeping
us back is our politics.


191
0:11:29,3 --> 0:11:32,266
The only thing preventing these
bills from being passed is the


192
0:11:32,266 --> 0:11:37,667
refusal of some folks in
Congress to put the country


193
0:11:37,667 --> 0:11:41,533
ahead of party.


194
0:11:41,533 --> 0:11:43,667
There are some in Congress right
now who would rather see their


195
0:11:43,667 --> 0:11:49,333
opponents lose than
see America win.


196
0:11:49,333 --> 0:11:52,834
And that has to stop.


197
0:11:52,834 --> 0:11:56,133
It's got to stop.


198
0:11:56,133 --> 0:11:59,734
We're supposed to all
be on the same team,


199
0:11:59,734 --> 0:12:3,4
especially when we're
going through tough times.


200
0:12:3,4 --> 0:12:9,734
We can't afford to play
games -- not right now,


201
0:12:9,734 --> 0:12:15,834
not when the stakes are
so high for our economy.


202
0:12:15,834 --> 0:12:19,567
And if you agree with me --
it doesn't matter if you're a


203
0:12:19,567 --> 0:12:23,0
Democrat or a Republican
or an independent --


204
0:12:23,0 --> 0:12:27,0
you've got to let Congress know.


205
0:12:27,0 --> 0:12:30,467
You've got to tell them you've
had enough of the theatrics.


206
0:12:30,467 --> 0:12:32,3
You've had enough
of the politics.


207
0:12:32,3 --> 0:12:33,934
Stop sending out press releases.


208
0:12:33,934 --> 0:12:36,834
Start passing some bills
that we all know will help our


209
0:12:36,834 --> 0:12:38,233
economy right now.


210
0:12:38,233 --> 0:12:40,66
That's what they need to do --
they've got to hear from you.


211
0:12:40,66 --> 0:12:49,133
(applause)


212
0:12:49,133 --> 0:12:52,3
Let me be specific -- I'll
give you some examples.


213
0:12:52,3 --> 0:12:56,233
You've got to tell them to
extend the payroll tax cut,


214
0:12:56,233 --> 0:12:58,767
so middle-class families
will continue to have more


215
0:12:58,767 --> 0:13:0,6
money to spend.


216
0:13:0,6 --> 0:13:2,3
We passed this in December.


217
0:13:2,3 --> 0:13:7,533
The average family received
$1,000 from that tax cut,


218
0:13:7,533 --> 0:13:9,433
and you need to get it
again, because the economy


219
0:13:9,433 --> 0:13:11,7
is still weak.


220
0:13:11,7 --> 0:13:15,233
It's going to help
you make ends meet,


221
0:13:15,233 --> 0:13:18,633
but it's also going to mean
more customers for businesses.


222
0:13:18,633 --> 0:13:21,4
It will increase demand.


223
0:13:21,4 --> 0:13:24,4
It's right for the economy, and
I would sign that bill today if


224
0:13:24,4 --> 0:13:25,934
it came to my desk.


225
0:13:25,934 --> 0:13:33,533
(applause)


226
0:13:33,533 --> 0:13:36,6
Tell Congress to get past their
differences and send me a road


227
0:13:36,6 --> 0:13:37,734
construction bill --


228
0:13:37,734 --> 0:13:38,567
(applause)


229
0:13:38,567 --> 0:13:40,767
-- so that companies can put
tens of thousands of people to


230
0:13:40,767 --> 0:13:43,9
work right now building our
roads and bridges and airports


231
0:13:43,9 --> 0:13:44,867
and seaports.


232
0:13:44,867 --> 0:13:48,1
(applause)


233
0:13:48,1 --> 0:13:49,233
I mean, think about it.


234
0:13:49,233 --> 0:13:52,567
America used to have the
best stuff -- best roads,


235
0:13:52,567 --> 0:13:56,7
best airports, best seaports.


236
0:13:56,7 --> 0:14:0,266
We're slipping behind because
we're not investing in it,


237
0:14:0,266 --> 0:14:3,567
because of politics
and gridlock.


238
0:14:3,567 --> 0:14:4,967
Do you want to put
people to work right now


239
0:14:4,967 --> 0:14:6,734
rebuilding America?


240
0:14:6,734 --> 0:14:8,633
You've got to send that
message to Congress.


241
0:14:8,633 --> 0:14:14,467
(applause)


242
0:14:14,467 --> 0:14:18,3
Send a message to Congress to
come to an agreement on trade


243
0:14:18,3 --> 0:14:22,1
deals that will level the
playing field and open markets


244
0:14:22,1 --> 0:14:26,66
to our businesses -- so we can
sell more goods to countries


245
0:14:26,66 --> 0:14:27,266
around the world.


246
0:14:27,266 --> 0:14:31,967
(applause)


247
0:14:31,967 --> 0:14:37,1
We've got a lot of Americans
driving Kias and Hyundais.


248
0:14:37,1 --> 0:14:40,433
I want folks in Korea driving
Fords and Chevys and Chryslers.


249
0:14:40,433 --> 0:14:42,4
(applause)


250
0:14:42,4 --> 0:14:43,533
I'd like to see that.


251
0:14:43,533 --> 0:14:50,0
(applause)


252
0:14:50,0 --> 0:14:52,567
I want to see billions of
dollars' more products sold


253
0:14:52,567 --> 0:14:56,6
around the world stamped with
three words: "Made in America."


254
0:14:56,6 --> 0:14:57,4
(applause)


255
0:14:57,4 --> 0:14:58,266
"Made in America."


256
0:14:58,266 --> 0:15:1,734
(applause)


257
0:15:1,734 --> 0:15:5,9
Those trade bills are teed
up; they're ready to go.


258
0:15:5,9 --> 0:15:9,433
Let's get it done.


259
0:15:9,433 --> 0:15:13,6
Tell Congress we need to
reform the patent system,


260
0:15:13,6 --> 0:15:17,433
so entrepreneurs like the ones
who developed some of the


261
0:15:17,433 --> 0:15:20,133
technology here can turn their
ideas into businesses more


262
0:15:20,133 --> 0:15:24,734
quickly; so companies like this
one can better compete against


263
0:15:24,734 --> 0:15:26,667
companies around the world.


264
0:15:26,667 --> 0:15:29,367
We shouldn't make it so
difficult for somebody with a


265
0:15:29,367 --> 0:15:34,8
good idea to translate
that into a business.


266
0:15:34,8 --> 0:15:39,2
Tell Congress we've got hundreds
of thousands of bright,


267
0:15:39,2 --> 0:15:43,0
talented, skilled Americans who
are returning home from Iraq


268
0:15:43,0 --> 0:15:44,333
and Afghanistan.


269
0:15:44,333 --> 0:15:47,133
And I've proposed connecting
those veterans looking for work


270
0:15:47,133 --> 0:15:49,66
with businesses that
need their skills.


271
0:15:49,66 --> 0:15:51,834
You've got 24-year-olds and
25-year-olds that are leading


272
0:15:51,834 --> 0:15:58,66
platoons and handling equipment
that's worth tens or hundreds of


273
0:15:58,66 --> 0:16:1,433
billions of dollars, and they
come back here and they can't


274
0:16:1,433 --> 0:16:3,834
find a job?


275
0:16:3,834 --> 0:16:6,734
Let's put them to work.


276
0:16:6,734 --> 0:16:8,633
These are things we
can do right now.


277
0:16:8,633 --> 0:16:12,934
(applause)


278
0:16:12,934 --> 0:16:16,166
These are things I've
already proposed,


279
0:16:16,166 --> 0:16:19,767
we've worked out the glitches,
the legislation is drafted --


280
0:16:19,767 --> 0:16:25,1
let's get it done.


281
0:16:25,1 --> 0:16:28,533
Now, given the weaknesses
of the economy,


282
0:16:28,533 --> 0:16:30,3
we need to do even
more than that.


283
0:16:30,3 --> 0:16:32,1
And over the coming weeks, I'm
going to be putting out more


284
0:16:32,1 --> 0:16:36,333
proposals, week by week, that
will help businesses hire and


285
0:16:36,333 --> 0:16:39,4
put people back to work.


286
0:16:39,4 --> 0:16:41,7
And I'm going to keep at it
until every single American who


287
0:16:41,7 --> 0:16:46,367
wants a job can find one.


288
0:16:46,367 --> 0:16:52,433
Now, we do have to
pay for these things.


289
0:16:52,433 --> 0:16:54,633
And in order to pay
for these things,


290
0:16:54,633 --> 0:16:58,533
Congress has to finish the job
of reducing the nation's budget


291
0:16:58,533 --> 0:17:4,834
deficit in a sensible,
responsible way.


292
0:17:4,834 --> 0:17:8,266
Not just with more cuts
this year or next year --


293
0:17:8,266 --> 0:17:11,834
those cuts would weaken the
economy more than it already is,


294
0:17:11,834 --> 0:17:15,467
and we've already cut a trillion
dollars in what's called


295
0:17:15,467 --> 0:17:18,266
discretionary spending.


296
0:17:18,266 --> 0:17:21,834
What we need is a long-term plan
to get our nation's finances


297
0:17:21,834 --> 0:17:23,8
in order.


298
0:17:23,8 --> 0:17:29,133
That's the only way we can
invest in places like this.


299
0:17:29,133 --> 0:17:31,266
That's how we can fund the
research at the Department


300
0:17:31,266 --> 0:17:32,8
of Energy.


301
0:17:32,8 --> 0:17:35,1
That's how we can fund the
community college that trained


302
0:17:35,1 --> 0:17:37,2
folks to be able to work here.


303
0:17:37,2 --> 0:17:38,934
That's how we can fund the
infrastructure and the


304
0:17:38,934 --> 0:17:43,5
technology that will
help us win the future --


305
0:17:43,5 --> 0:17:47,0
by doing what you
do, what families do.


306
0:17:47,0 --> 0:17:50,834
Think about it: When things are
tight you cut out those things


307
0:17:50,834 --> 0:17:54,834
you cannot afford,
even if it's tough,


308
0:17:54,834 --> 0:18:0,66
to pay for the things
that really matter.


309
0:18:0,66 --> 0:18:3,867
You don't cut out the
college fund for your kids.


310
0:18:3,867 --> 0:18:8,8
You stop maybe
going out as often.


311
0:18:8,8 --> 0:18:14,867
You don't stop taking care of
your parent who needs care.


312
0:18:14,867 --> 0:18:17,6
You cut back on some of
the things that you don't


313
0:18:17,6 --> 0:18:20,133
really need.


314
0:18:20,133 --> 0:18:25,467
The same principle
applies to government.


315
0:18:25,467 --> 0:18:28,433
And by the way, in
your own families,


316
0:18:28,433 --> 0:18:32,3
I'm assuming you don't just keep
all the stuff you like and tell


317
0:18:32,3 --> 0:18:35,4
your spouse, you got to get
rid of all the stuff she likes


318
0:18:35,4 --> 0:18:36,3
or he likes.


319
0:18:36,3 --> 0:18:37,1
(laughter)


320
0:18:37,1 --> 0:18:41,1
That wouldn't work
in my household.


321
0:18:41,1 --> 0:18:44,633
You don't just cut out the stuff
that's important to you and --


322
0:18:44,633 --> 0:18:47,6
or keep all the stuff that's
important to you and cut out the


323
0:18:47,6 --> 0:18:51,433
stuff that's important
for your kids.


324
0:18:51,433 --> 0:18:54,1
The same is true for us
as an American family.


325
0:18:54,1 --> 0:18:57,667
We can't ask the
people in this room --


326
0:18:57,667 --> 0:18:59,967
working families,
middle-class families --


327
0:18:59,967 --> 0:19:2,367
to bear the entire burden.


328
0:19:2,367 --> 0:19:4,633
We're not going to balance
our budgets on the back of


329
0:19:4,633 --> 0:19:7,0
middle-class and working
people in this country.


330
0:19:7,0 --> 0:19:8,633
Everybody has got
to do their part.


331
0:19:8,633 --> 0:19:16,767
(applause)


332
0:19:16,767 --> 0:19:18,66
Everybody has got
to do their part.


333
0:19:18,66 --> 0:19:22,367
Everybody has got to chip in.


334
0:19:22,367 --> 0:19:23,934
That's fair.


335
0:19:23,934 --> 0:19:27,233
You learn it in kindergarten.


336
0:19:27,233 --> 0:19:30,33
That's what all this fuss was
about in Washington: Are we


337
0:19:30,33 --> 0:19:36,533
going to deal with our
deficit in a way that's fair?


338
0:19:36,533 --> 0:19:39,333
And that means closing tax
loopholes for billionaires


339
0:19:39,333 --> 0:19:41,533
before we cut college
loans for young people.


340
0:19:41,533 --> 0:19:47,767
(applause)


341
0:19:47,767 --> 0:19:50,1
That means ending government
subsidies for oil and gas


342
0:19:50,1 --> 0:19:53,333
companies that are doing very
well before you cut health care


343
0:19:53,333 --> 0:19:54,367
for seniors.


344
0:19:54,367 --> 0:19:59,734
(applause)


345
0:19:59,734 --> 0:20:2,333
It means making sure that the
biggest corporations pay their


346
0:20:2,333 --> 0:20:6,633
fair share in taxes before
we gut the investments in


347
0:20:6,633 --> 0:20:11,967
technology and clean energy that
made this factory a reality.


348
0:20:11,967 --> 0:20:16,9
Now, that's just common sense.


349
0:20:16,9 --> 0:20:22,567
It should have
bipartisan support.


350
0:20:22,567 --> 0:20:26,66
These are things we
could be doing right now.


351
0:20:26,66 --> 0:20:29,567
That's how we can jumpstart
this economy and speed up the


352
0:20:29,567 --> 0:20:33,633
recovery and get
more folks working --


353
0:20:33,633 --> 0:20:35,934
while making sure that we
get our fiscal house in order.


354
0:20:35,934 --> 0:20:40,834
We can do both.


355
0:20:40,834 --> 0:20:43,333
And I'll be laying out more
proposals in the days ahead.


356
0:20:43,333 --> 0:20:46,367
And I'm going to keep after
every idea and every serious


357
0:20:46,367 --> 0:20:49,33
proposal to help us
grow this economy --


358
0:20:49,33 --> 0:20:52,867
until everybody who
wants a job can find one.


359
0:20:52,867 --> 0:20:55,467
But I want everybody
to understand here,


360
0:20:55,467 --> 0:20:59,5
the problem is not that
we don't have answers.


361
0:20:59,5 --> 0:21:6,367
The problem is, is that folks
are playing political games.


362
0:21:6,367 --> 0:21:7,934
And we've got a long way to go.


363
0:21:7,934 --> 0:21:11,166
We didn't get into
this mess overnight,


364
0:21:11,166 --> 0:21:13,467
and it's going to take
time to get us out.


365
0:21:13,467 --> 0:21:15,533
That's the truth.


366
0:21:15,533 --> 0:21:18,3
But that's no
excuse for inaction.


367
0:21:18,3 --> 0:21:20,467
It's time to put
aside ultimatums.


368
0:21:20,467 --> 0:21:26,4
It's time to stop drawing
lines in the sand.


369
0:21:26,4 --> 0:21:32,0
You know, in the aftermath of
this whole debt ceiling debacle,


370
0:21:32,0 --> 0:21:35,233
and when the market's going
up and down like they are,


371
0:21:35,233 --> 0:21:37,7
there's been a lot of talk in
Washington right now that I


372
0:21:37,7 --> 0:21:43,734
should call Congress back early.


373
0:21:43,734 --> 0:21:47,33
The last thing we need is
Congress spending more time


374
0:21:47,33 --> 0:21:48,6
arguing in D.C.


375
0:21:48,6 --> 0:21:53,934
(applause)


376
0:21:53,934 --> 0:21:58,33
What I figure is, they need
to spend more time out here


377
0:21:58,33 --> 0:22:1,5
listening to you and
hearing how fed up you are.


378
0:22:1,5 --> 0:22:3,2
(applause)


379
0:22:3,2 --> 0:22:5,367
That's why I'm here.


380
0:22:5,367 --> 0:22:7,734
That's why I'll be traveling to
a lot of communities like this


381
0:22:7,734 --> 0:22:10,2
one over the next week.


382
0:22:10,2 --> 0:22:11,934
That's what Congress
should be doing --


383
0:22:11,934 --> 0:22:14,8
go back home, listen to
people's frustrations with all


384
0:22:14,8 --> 0:22:16,767
the gridlock.


385
0:22:16,767 --> 0:22:24,533
Listen to how frustrated folks
are with the constant bickering


386
0:22:24,533 --> 0:22:28,633
and the unwillingness to
compromise and the desire to


387
0:22:28,633 --> 0:22:35,667
score points, even if it's at
the expense of our country.


388
0:22:35,667 --> 0:22:38,166
And if they're
listening hard enough,


389
0:22:38,166 --> 0:22:42,66
maybe they'll come back to
Washington ready to compromise


390
0:22:42,66 --> 0:22:44,767
and ready to create jobs and
ready to reduce our deficit --


391
0:22:44,767 --> 0:22:51,4
ready to do what you
sent them there to do.


392
0:22:51,4 --> 0:22:57,9
You know, America voted
for divided government.


393
0:22:57,9 --> 0:23:0,4
And that makes it tough.


394
0:23:0,4 --> 0:23:3,767
You got one party controlling
the House of Representatives,


395
0:23:3,767 --> 0:23:7,433
another party
controlling the Senate.


396
0:23:7,433 --> 0:23:10,934
So they voted for -- you
voted for divided government.


397
0:23:10,934 --> 0:23:16,166
But you didn't vote for
dysfunctional government.


398
0:23:16,166 --> 0:23:22,533
You didn't vote for a
do-nothing government.


399
0:23:22,533 --> 0:23:26,66
You didn't vote for a government
where folks are just looking out


400
0:23:26,66 --> 0:23:29,767
for special interests.


401
0:23:29,767 --> 0:23:36,667
You didn't vote for a government
that is beholden to lobbyists.


402
0:23:36,667 --> 0:23:40,6
We've got a lot of work to do,
and the only way we will get it


403
0:23:40,6 --> 0:23:46,433
done is if everybody,
Democrats and Republicans,


404
0:23:46,433 --> 0:23:50,967
find a way to put
country ahead of party.


405
0:23:50,967 --> 0:23:53,433
That's what I'm fighting for.


406
0:23:53,433 --> 0:23:55,934
I'm here to enlist
you in that fight.


407
0:23:55,934 --> 0:23:58,133
You've got to hold
everybody accountable,


408
0:23:58,133 --> 0:24:1,133
because if we can come together
and find common ground,


409
0:24:1,133 --> 0:24:3,734
there is no stopping the
United States of America.


410
0:24:3,734 --> 0:24:5,266
There is no holding us back.


411
0:24:5,266 --> 0:24:6,133
(applause)


412
0:24:6,133 --> 0:24:8,533
We can strengthen this economy,
and we can put our nation


413
0:24:8,533 --> 0:24:9,667
back to work.


414
0:24:9,667 --> 0:24:11,8
And we can lead the world
in growing industries.


415
0:24:11,8 --> 0:24:15,33
And we will make it through
these economic storms and reach


416
0:24:15,33 --> 0:24:17,367
calmer waters stronger
than we were before.


417
0:24:17,367 --> 0:24:18,233
Thank you very much, everybody.


418
0:24:18,233 --> 0:24:19,767
God bless you.


419
0:24:19,767 --> 0:24:20,533
Thank you.


420
0:24:20,533 --> 0:26:20,533
(applause)
