and it took over a hundred and fifty
years to fail

military strong

0:1:30,52 --> 0:1:32,96
it's not just a fortress


23
0:1:32,96 --> 0:1:33,63
it's suspect

exquisite suite of darkness

the alhambra it's not too triumphalism

became staying


48
0:2:51,319 --> 0:2:52,979
the empire


49
0:2:52,979 --> 0:2:57,11
and it was in ny period if collapse that
we see local lads


50
0:2:57,11 --> 0:3:1,83
like mohammed first an acid density
beginning to combat anisha for


51
0:3:1,83 --> 0:3:3,459
themselves


52
0:3:3,459 --> 0:3:8,379
not much is known about muhammad it
denies he had before he enters granada


53
0:3:8,379 --> 0:3:12,99
he was just one of the many minus
sultans warren over the scraps of the


54
0:3:12,99 --> 0:3:14,599
fading muslim empire


55
0:3:14,599 --> 0:3:17,59
when cast steel advanced on his northern
territories


56
0:3:17,59 --> 0:3:18,719
he headed south


57
0:3:18,719 --> 0:3:21,459
and took over granada under
circumstances


58
0:3:21,459 --> 0:3:23,889
curtis shrouded in mystery


59
0:3:23,889 --> 0:3:26,109
easy opportunistic leave act


60
0:3:26,109 --> 0:3:29,999
an enterprising individual who's making
best use of the political circumstances


61
0:3:29,999 --> 0:3:34,549
at the time two tries to cheer the any
chance of very existence


62
0:3:34,549 --> 0:3:37,359
including renata


63
0:3:37,359 --> 0:3:41,68
once they're muhammad climbed a wooded
slopes about granada


64
0:3:41,68 --> 0:3:44,47
in search of a location to build the
fortress


65
0:3:44,47 --> 0:3:51,919
in which he could safely on his family
and the nationals from kristina paris


66
0:3:51,919 --> 0:3:56,129
he heard of a force built up from thirty
years and a half hour previous testing


67
0:3:56,129 --> 0:4:2,339
and climb to the hill to investigate


68
0:4:2,339 --> 0:4:6,829
before him the ancient arab casa lsac
thomas a beacon hill


69
0:4:6,829 --> 0:4:10,599
framed by the mountains of the sierra
nevada


70
0:4:10,599 --> 0:4:14,859
it was the perfect site for a fortress


71
0:4:14,859 --> 0:4:19,47
in his mind's eye he conceived grow
before him


72
0:4:19,47 --> 0:4:27,62
muhammad had found his ideal location


73
0:4:27,62 --> 0:4:31,62
decide because he historical wasteful
forties


74
0:4:31,62 --> 0:4:33,21
because is sucky


75
0:4:33,21 --> 0:4:37,33
nearly lost on the media fight don
antonio audit went out


76
0:4:37,33 --> 0:4:40,75
isn't experts in the architecture of the
alhambra


77
0:4:40,75 --> 0:4:43,29
he believes the chill griffey if the
area


78
0:4:43,29 --> 0:4:45,89
is perfect for a stronghold


79
0:4:45,89 --> 0:4:46,38
unhindered back


80
0:4:46,38 --> 0:4:49,919
are desires he's of sierra nevada so


81
0:4:49,919 --> 0:4:55,509
no report in to dickey's will be fine


82
0:4:55,509 --> 0:4:59,809
muhammad instantly recognized the sites
defensive possibilities


83
0:4:59,809 --> 0:5:3,449
she started to outline the citadel if
his dreams


84
0:5:3,449 --> 0:5:7,69
the first step was to rebuild the
existing fortress known as the outcomes


85
0:5:7,69 --> 0:5:8,49
of god


86
0:5:8,49 --> 0:5:12,509
into a stronghold large enough to
support his troops


87
0:5:12,509 --> 0:5:17,159
this would goddess suite of palaces
surrounded by luxurious gardens


88
0:5:17,159 --> 0:5:18,89
that would form a royal quarter


89
0:5:18,89 --> 0:5:21,479
on the northern side of the hill


90
0:5:21,479 --> 0:5:23,4
undecided township


91
0:5:23,4 --> 0:5:24,62
colder medina


92
0:5:24,62 --> 0:5:30,999
housing the hundreds of people needed to
run this royal bastante


93
0:5:30,999 --> 0:5:34,289
encircling it would be a gigantic
perimeter walls


94
0:5:34,289 --> 0:5:39,29
dotted with dot talents to fight off
marauding attackers


95
0:5:39,29 --> 0:5:50,55
the first he needed to build the
watchtower


96
0:5:50,55 --> 0:5:54,58
defensive towers would form an integral
part of muhammad's concept for the


97
0:5:54,58 --> 0:5:56,709
alhambra


98
0:5:56,709 --> 0:6:0,929
the basic building block of each town it
was a square chamber repeated at every


99
0:6:0,929 --> 0:6:2,319
level


100
0:6:2,319 --> 0:6:5,36
these chambers would be filled with
faulted arches


101
0:6:5,36 --> 0:6:13,599
that led light flood through the
interior spaces


102
0:6:13,599 --> 0:6:17,939
the first hour muhammad would build was
the tolerated and i think that known as


103
0:6:17,939 --> 0:6:20,639
the watchtower by the locals


104
0:6:20,639 --> 0:6:25,969
this brooding giant was bigger than
anything granada had seen before


105
0:6:25,969 --> 0:6:32,85
it sent a message to both muslim and
christian alike


106
0:6:32,85 --> 0:6:35,919
it was a statement to the people off or
not


107
0:6:35,919 --> 0:6:39,199
lasted realistic trying to say we can
defend you


108
0:6:39,199 --> 0:6:41,46
but remember that we are you live


109
0:6:41,46 --> 0:6:47,27
and that we are powerful on that week
dominates you as all subject


110
0:6:47,27 --> 0:6:51,539
service watchtower needed to be strong
enough to hold off any attackers


111
0:6:51,539 --> 0:6:55,19
wild bill this constructed the rest of
the alhambra


112
0:6:55,19 --> 0:6:56,28
for this to work


113
0:6:56,28 --> 0:6:59,87
muhammad wanted it positioned on the
extreme weston tip of the should be


114
0:6:59,87 --> 0:7:0,879
cahill


115
0:7:0,879 --> 0:7:5,309
where it would act as the unka for his
plans new fortress


116
0:7:5,309 --> 0:7:9,699
here it would be surrounded by steep
slopes on three sides protecting it from


117
0:7:9,699 --> 0:7:10,539
attack


118
0:7:10,539 --> 0:7:15,479
as it dominated the granada plane


119
0:7:15,479 --> 0:7:18,129
constructing a huge tower on the
precipice


120
0:7:18,129 --> 0:7:20,5
using nothing but primitive tools


121
0:7:20,5 --> 0:7:23,309
would not be easy for the builders


122
0:7:23,309 --> 0:7:28,639
but the solution to that problem they've
right beneath their feet


123
0:7:28,639 --> 0:7:32,21
they were building that fortress on
almost sheer drop


124
0:7:32,21 --> 0:7:33,779
great for defense


125
0:7:33,779 --> 0:7:39,49
and a gigantic gash in that steep slope
reveals the amazing substance that made


126
0:7:39,49 --> 0:7:41,529
the alhambra possible


127
0:7:41,529 --> 0:7:46,359
beneath the tolerate eleven civil
engineer at mcad investigates a seam of


128
0:7:46,359 --> 0:7:49,12
this red rock


129
0:7:49,12 --> 0:7:52,11
paula secrets to the construction of
this place only


130
0:7:52,11 --> 0:7:53,639
is this material here


131
0:7:53,639 --> 0:7:55,77
it is the famous alhambra conglomerate


132
0:7:55,77 --> 0:7:59,69
an extra-special ai and sandanistas


133
0:7:59,69 --> 0:8:1,29
c_n_n_'s love it


134
0:8:1,29 --> 0:8:2,96
get it by some weight


135
0:8:2,96 --> 0:8:5,79
clapton's is the client


136
0:8:5,79 --> 0:8:7,69
starts getting sticky


137
0:8:7,69 --> 0:8:9,8
service material becomes moldable


138
0:8:9,8 --> 0:8:11,33
and they use this stuff


139
0:8:11,33 --> 0:8:13,24
to make that


140
0:8:13,24 --> 0:8:18,29
it gave the builders of ready-made
source of materials onsite


141
0:8:18,29 --> 0:8:20,619
this sped up the construction timetable


142
0:8:20,619 --> 0:8:23,96
and kept them close to the fortress they
were building


143
0:8:23,96 --> 0:8:27,2
it's kalo also gave the stronghold it's
name


144
0:8:27,2 --> 0:8:28,71
the madina alhambra


145
0:8:28,71 --> 0:8:29,78
which means


146
0:8:29,78 --> 0:8:34,79
red city


147
0:8:34,79 --> 0:8:39,7
this amazing early cement allowed the
builders to lay a strong concrete base


148
0:8:39,7 --> 0:8:44,4
for the great watchtower without having
to quarry and transport huge amounts of


149
0:8:44,4 --> 0:8:46,36
stone


150
0:8:46,36 --> 0:8:48,92
thought there was a serious flaw in the
bill


151
0:8:48,92 --> 0:8:50,72
his design


152
0:8:50,72 --> 0:8:54,33
the core of the tower was supported by
tears of options


153
0:8:54,33 --> 0:8:57,64
the full weight of the building resting
upon them


154
0:8:57,64 --> 0:8:59,41
halfway through construction


155
0:8:59,41 --> 0:9:4,31
the builders realized that the arches
were not strong enough to take the mood


156
0:9:4,31 --> 0:9:9,6
muhammad's first hour could collapse in
on itself at any minute as an extra


157
0:9:9,6 --> 0:9:10,8
means of support


158
0:9:10,8 --> 0:9:14,23
they filled in part of the basement to
provide a solid foundation for the


159
0:9:14,23 --> 0:9:16,3
talent to rest on


160
0:9:16,3 --> 0:9:18,1
that hasty repairs


161
0:9:18,1 --> 0:9:20,63
failed to fix the problem


162
0:9:20,63 --> 0:9:23,54
muhammad's fortress was in danger


163
0:9:23,54 --> 0:9:28,14
falling down


164
0:9:28,14 --> 0:9:31,99

165
0:9:31,99 --> 0:9:36,85
the alhambra sinning watchtower the
story that i think that was in trouble


166
0:9:36,85 --> 0:9:40,98
passage builders began to erected
supplementals it was clear that the


167
0:9:40,98 --> 0:9:44,39
lower levels were not strong enough to
support them


168
0:9:44,39 --> 0:9:47,64
edmica explores to find out why


169
0:9:47,64 --> 0:9:49,17
uh... this area


170
0:9:49,17 --> 0:9:52,36
was misleading or for a national news


171
0:9:52,36 --> 0:9:56,12
who were brought here a series of
options that he didn't believe he broke


172
0:9:56,12 --> 0:9:57,82
up


173
0:9:57,82 --> 0:10:2,56
is on his own shootings and vicinity


174
0:10:2,56 --> 0:10:6,75
you know this has nothing to do this
when the structures working for women


175
0:10:6,75 --> 0:10:10,27
who happens to losses in revenue


176
0:10:10,27 --> 0:10:17,59
the structures in distress


177
0:10:17,59 --> 0:10:19,41
there is a


178
0:10:19,41 --> 0:10:21,42
although it here


179
0:10:21,42 --> 0:10:24,8
is very substantial structural crack


180
0:10:24,8 --> 0:10:29,6
roman war our problems what or waiting
on the wall


181
0:10:29,6 --> 0:10:30,9
right away to the floor


182
0:10:30,9 --> 0:10:34,22
is incredible if you're in the hands on


183
0:10:34,22 --> 0:10:37,18
moral issues is that this for me


184
0:10:37,18 --> 0:10:38,73
this one here


185
0:10:38,73 --> 0:10:44,32
postpone the away from this one here
lungs crack for the question is what


186
0:10:44,32 --> 0:10:46,54
post is for one more


187
0:10:46,54 --> 0:10:50,79
the weight of the tower was crushing the
options that were holding it out pushing


188
0:10:50,79 --> 0:10:55,85
it out of shape and cracking its walls


189
0:10:55,85 --> 0:10:58,54
soledad when the spending cuts that they
were


190
0:10:58,54 --> 0:11:0,36
isn't going to go up


191
0:11:0,36 --> 0:11:2,4
here your honor the arch


192
0:11:2,4 --> 0:11:6,74
and turned into a wall something that
was also someone said


193
0:11:6,74 --> 0:11:10,21
muhammad's builders brick topped the
options to provide the crucial support


194
0:11:10,21 --> 0:11:14,82
needed but the interior of the talent no
longer or any resemblance to its


195
0:11:14,82 --> 0:11:16,89
original design


196
0:11:16,89 --> 0:11:20,98
the sultans vision of auction spaces
with a varied into play of light and


197
0:11:20,98 --> 0:11:21,899
shadow


198
0:11:21,899 --> 0:11:24,13
has vanished entirely


199
0:11:24,13 --> 0:11:30,66
in its place is a brutal monument to the
needs of the age


200
0:11:30,66 --> 0:11:31,88
those needs


201
0:11:31,88 --> 0:11:33,96
were defensive


202
0:11:33,96 --> 0:11:38,42
muhammad's great watchtower looks out
over the plains of the sierra nevada


203
0:11:38,42 --> 0:11:42,1
with the distant hills of the kingdom on
the horizon


204
0:11:42,1 --> 0:11:44,41
covered by martin city today


205
0:11:44,41 --> 0:11:48,79
the watchtower once looked out over the
wind farm land


206
0:11:48,79 --> 0:11:53,39
gear it's ideally cited to form the
heart of the great intelligence network


207
0:11:53,39 --> 0:11:55,73
that god's muhammad's kingdom


208
0:11:55,73 --> 0:11:59,76
and the sultan house in need of such a
network


209
0:11:59,76 --> 0:12:4,9
by twelve forty five just seven years
after he took over granada muhammad has


210
0:12:4,9 --> 0:12:9,34
already lost his northern territories to
the christian advance and his army is


211
0:12:9,34 --> 0:12:13,63
too small to win them back


212
0:12:13,63 --> 0:12:16,9
this is not a man who is surviving on
the basis of


213
0:12:16,9 --> 0:12:18,47
military might


214
0:12:18,47 --> 0:12:22,16
and those days are long gone he
surviving on information


215
0:12:22,16 --> 0:12:24,54
and on his relationships


216
0:12:24,54 --> 0:12:27,779
as professor didi fairchild rock als and
those


217
0:12:27,779 --> 0:12:33,28
the alhambra scanned tinued existence is
dependent on the good intelligence


218
0:12:33,28 --> 0:12:36,769
needs information he needs to know when
enemies are approaching


219
0:12:36,769 --> 0:12:40,64
and he needs to know what's going on to
gather this information


220
0:12:40,64 --> 0:12:43,38
the installs a network of signal towers


221
0:12:43,38 --> 0:12:46,98
designed to warn him of the christian
advance


222
0:12:46,98 --> 0:12:51,18
this network a fork lifts was known as
talia asks


223
0:12:51,18 --> 0:12:55,62
they were part of a vast information
gathering system etc dot it intelligence


224
0:12:55,62 --> 0:12:58,26
from people who passed through the area


225
0:12:58,26 --> 0:13:2,13
providing early warning of christian
troop movements


226
0:13:2,13 --> 0:13:6,22
signals warning of impending attack
would be transmitted from the top of the


227
0:13:6,22 --> 0:13:10,1
tower by means of special may replace


228
0:13:10,1 --> 0:13:16,88
all fun


229
0:13:16,88 --> 0:13:17,86
from there


230
0:13:17,86 --> 0:13:22,16
they race from talent to talent
traveling into the kingdom towards the


231
0:13:22,16 --> 0:13:24,87
alhambra


232
0:13:24,87 --> 0:13:29,59
until ultimately they arrive on the roof
of the alhambra swatched our whether a


233
0:13:29,59 --> 0:13:33,31
warm the sultan of impending attack


234
0:13:33,31 --> 0:13:35,49
in twelve forty six


235
0:13:35,49 --> 0:13:37,17
messages from his signal towers


236
0:13:37,17 --> 0:13:42,19
tell muhammad at the christian king
fernando of castio has taken high-end


237
0:13:42,19 --> 0:13:45,57
sixty six kilometers north of granada


238
0:13:45,57 --> 0:13:48,8
it's a major blow


239
0:13:48,8 --> 0:13:52,63
muhammad realizes that he cannot stop
the caste indian entrance


240
0:13:52,63 --> 0:13:57,9
he needs more time to complete his
fortress


241
0:13:57,9 --> 0:14:0,63
he strikes a deal with fernando in
return for guarantees of his own


242
0:14:0,63 --> 0:14:2,39
autonomy


243
0:14:2,39 --> 0:14:4,78
muhammad not only gives up and


244
0:14:4,78 --> 0:14:7,55
he helps fernando cc bill


245
0:14:7,55 --> 0:14:9,25
it's a clever move


246
0:14:9,25 --> 0:14:12,75
but it's also an admission of weakness


247
0:14:12,75 --> 0:14:17,14
lots of people were shocked eddie had in
effect abandoned high-end


248
0:14:17,14 --> 0:14:21,4
the reason he kicked back with to
protect the city of print not a he felt


249
0:14:21,4 --> 0:14:26,97
that this was that cost that had to be
paid to protect the enclave he created


250
0:14:26,97 --> 0:14:31,79
muhammad knows the uneasy troops might
break down at any moment he wants to


251
0:14:31,79 --> 0:14:33,44
ensure that he citadel


252
0:14:33,44 --> 0:14:36,66
is secure is quickly as possible


253
0:14:36,66 --> 0:14:40,9
to do that he must finish the outcomes
about fortress which will house the


254
0:14:40,9 --> 0:14:43,84
troops guarding the alhambra


255
0:14:43,84 --> 0:14:49,19
the plan is to build a triangular consul
conquered upon three towers


256
0:14:49,19 --> 0:14:50,59
from here


257
0:14:50,59 --> 0:14:54,8
a gate house in the back wall provides
access to the rest of the alhambra


258
0:14:54,8 --> 0:14:58,93
have working with the naturally
occurring alhambra conglomerate the


259
0:14:58,93 --> 0:15:3,76
builders use molds to arrest its three
me two thick walls k thing about me


260
0:15:3,76 --> 0:15:6,27
conglomerate diseases that you can build


261
0:15:6,27 --> 0:15:8,94
and this war he shows exactly how they
did it


262
0:15:8,94 --> 0:15:11,399
basically what you do is you build
yourself a mold


263
0:15:11,399 --> 0:15:15,689
yes his big panels joined together by a
series of timber polls and you can see


264
0:15:15,689 --> 0:15:20,129
where the polls would have gone here the
compulsory that put it in the panels in


265
0:15:20,129 --> 0:15:23,269
tied in together and then you're
throwing a conglomerate through the


266
0:15:23,269 --> 0:15:24,129
water


267
0:15:24,129 --> 0:15:27,32
and you're an all-white pounding it and
forcing


268
0:15:27,32 --> 0:15:32,7
particles of the conglomerate together
and really tight concrete light convicts


269
0:15:32,7 --> 0:15:33,769
they leave the letter dry


270
0:15:33,769 --> 0:15:37,68
then climb up onto it and repeat the
process


271
0:15:37,68 --> 0:15:41,6
but the engineers know that there's a
significant downsides to this method of


272
0:15:41,6 --> 0:15:44,96
construction with water and win the
stuff gets blown away i'm what you're


273
0:15:44,96 --> 0:15:48,48
looking at here is that your edited
surfaced out of the many years has lost


274
0:15:48,48 --> 0:15:49,79
its strength


275
0:15:49,79 --> 0:15:52,39
and to prevent that happening what they
did


276
0:15:52,39 --> 0:15:57,14
was their plight at alignments and stock
of which is what this finishes his


277
0:15:57,14 --> 0:15:59,7
sister's bicyclists and mix that would
lying


278
0:15:59,7 --> 0:16:2,199
and a bit of water and applied like a
plaster


279
0:16:2,199 --> 0:16:5,18
that's much much better than swart


280
0:16:5,18 --> 0:16:8,28
and in the job would be done


281
0:16:8,28 --> 0:16:12,36
in this way the walls and buildings that
made up the outcomes about


282
0:16:12,36 --> 0:16:14,95
could be erected swiftly and efficiently


283
0:16:14,95 --> 0:16:20,48
under the defensive chateau victoria del
evento


284
0:16:20,48 --> 0:16:24,38
looking down from this watchtower the
ground plan of the buildings that once


285
0:16:24,38 --> 0:16:28,35
filled the outcast of dollars still
visible


286
0:16:28,35 --> 0:16:30,46
this driving miniature township


287
0:16:30,46 --> 0:16:32,93
houses the troops that got the sultan


288
0:16:32,93 --> 0:16:36,71
and the people who look after them


289
0:16:36,71 --> 0:16:40,75
the central street in the heart of the
aisle kassebaum past five warehouses


290
0:16:40,75 --> 0:16:43,65
and thirteen private houses


291
0:16:43,65 --> 0:16:45,2
tarry


292
0:16:45,2 --> 0:16:46,3
kilns


293
0:16:46,3 --> 0:16:47,69
store houses


294
0:16:47,69 --> 0:16:51,33
and a bakery supply the populations
needs


295
0:16:51,33 --> 0:16:59,41
the out kassebaum he's tina with life


296
0:16:59,41 --> 0:17:4,14
and rising above them all of the great
defensive towers that overlooked the


297
0:17:4,14 --> 0:17:10,15
fortress


298
0:17:10,15 --> 0:17:14,84
sultan mohamed must've wandered through
his stronghold and felt that his dennis


299
0:17:14,84 --> 0:17:20,64
d could find in the pc kua


300
0:17:20,64 --> 0:17:25,3
thought there was more to the alhambra
than just a fortress because beyond the


301
0:17:25,3 --> 0:17:28,299
elk as a pa p plans a suite of palaces


302
0:17:28,299 --> 0:17:31,34
that will eventually how's the sultan
and his family


303
0:17:31,34 --> 0:17:32,73
along with gardens


304
0:17:32,73 --> 0:17:35,22
and a mini township to support them


305
0:17:35,22 --> 0:17:40,5
the alibi how population of not only
easel continents family but of course


306
0:17:40,5 --> 0:17:41,53
his followers


307
0:17:41,53 --> 0:17:47,73
answer rents and gardens of large
population that lived in that palace


308
0:17:47,73 --> 0:17:51,71
so one can think of that happening
intercity probably win as many as five


309
0:17:51,71 --> 0:17:54,23
thousand people living there


310
0:17:54,23 --> 0:17:56,6
in order to sustain this population


311
0:17:56,6 --> 0:17:59,53
the alhambra is threaded with darkness


312
0:17:59,53 --> 0:18:2,66
i'll call you know that all of us will
love money regardless of the other


313
0:18:2,66 --> 0:18:6,55
number are designed to recreate
annoyances


314
0:18:6,55 --> 0:18:10,54
don antonio mountain peak a has studied
the landscape of the hour hambrecht


315
0:18:10,54 --> 0:18:11,59
index


316
0:18:11,59 --> 0:18:12,399
for him


317
0:18:12,399 --> 0:18:15,66
the gardens have a dual purpose


318
0:18:15,66 --> 0:18:20,1
suddenly sensed the sensation of being
in that would be a similar space and at


319
0:18:20,1 --> 0:18:23,83
the same time a pro to the states
fundamental


320
0:18:23,83 --> 0:18:26,3
before


321
0:18:26,3 --> 0:18:30,25
so the gardens of the alhambra we
designed for practicality as well as


322
0:18:30,25 --> 0:18:31,52
pleasure


323
0:18:31,52 --> 0:18:36,82
to grow food as well as flowers


324
0:18:36,82 --> 0:18:39,9
there is just one problem


325
0:18:39,9 --> 0:18:44,13
there is no source of freshwater on the
sabhi ko


326
0:18:44,13 --> 0:18:48,37
it's issue drawback for a stronghold
expected to feed and water as many as


327
0:18:48,37 --> 0:18:50,69
five thousand people


328
0:18:50,69 --> 0:18:55,14
the nearest water source is the river
that flows just to the north of the site


329
0:18:55,14 --> 0:18:55,95
the case


330
0:18:55,95 --> 0:18:58,12
has a severe drawback


331
0:18:58,12 --> 0:19:0,49
cause if you've been here in the
thirties century


332
0:19:0,49 --> 0:19:4,19
revert dot i would've looked pretty much
like it does today the small babbling


333
0:19:4,19 --> 0:19:6,65
brook making its way through granada


334
0:19:6,65 --> 0:19:8,99
the basic problem amit has


335
0:19:8,99 --> 0:19:10,6
towards down here


336
0:19:10,6 --> 0:19:13,23
an immediate out there


337
0:19:13,23 --> 0:19:15,26
to make the alhambra viable


338
0:19:15,26 --> 0:19:18,1
its builders must divert an entire river


339
0:19:18,1 --> 0:19:23,97
up onto the mountain of mohammed


340
0:19:23,97 --> 0:19:28,51
and


341
0:19:28,51 --> 0:19:32,65
making a river float back onto the
alhambra is issued challenge


342
0:19:32,65 --> 0:19:37,35
but muhammad and his engineers must find
a way to make it happen


343
0:19:37,35 --> 0:19:41,7
because without it he cannot transform
these new citadel


344
0:19:41,7 --> 0:19:45,47
into a self-sufficient oases have gotten
some farmland


345
0:19:45,47 --> 0:19:50,32
he needs to carry gallons of water to
the gardens he's planning


346
0:19:50,32 --> 0:19:51,38
to do this


347
0:19:51,38 --> 0:19:55,0
he missed threat the alhambra with
irrigation channels


348
0:19:55,0 --> 0:20:1,1
and this is not an easy task


349
0:20:1,1 --> 0:20:5,54
it's easy to forget in the modern world
how significant war stories


350
0:20:5,54 --> 0:20:9,71
in the historic environment how
difficult was to get hold of


351
0:20:9,71 --> 0:20:12,549
cc imaginary community on tocqueville


352
0:20:12,549 --> 0:20:14,95
and computer tomorrow for water


353
0:20:14,95 --> 0:20:18,37
hundreds of feet above the water
supplies most obvious


354
0:20:18,37 --> 0:20:21,19
the local residents


355
0:20:21,19 --> 0:20:25,28
confronted with its plaguing the obvious
and clever thing we would use the there


356
0:20:25,28 --> 0:20:26,68
what


357
0:20:26,68 --> 0:20:29,14
to some point when it was actually above
them


358
0:20:29,14 --> 0:20:33,909
eleni energy of the river itself bring
water to them


359
0:20:33,909 --> 0:20:37,1
but there is no natural lake about the
alhambra


360
0:20:37,1 --> 0:20:39,47
so they create one


361
0:20:39,47 --> 0:20:42,94
muhammad's engineers constructed down
the path the alhambra


362
0:20:42,94 --> 0:20:45,22
which will build up enough water
pressure


363
0:20:45,22 --> 0:20:47,95
to feed into the citadel


364
0:20:47,95 --> 0:20:52,44
six kilometers from the alhambra dawn
antonio has found the downs at the


365
0:20:52,44 --> 0:20:55,539
engineers created


366
0:20:55,539 --> 0:20:59,929
before but i'm a fan of hillary we find
ourselves that israel battled exact


367
0:20:59,929 --> 0:21:3,75
point for the first man seeking mohammed
the first ordered the construction of


368
0:21:3,75 --> 0:21:8,26
attempt to divert water from the figured
that the other way


369
0:21:8,26 --> 0:21:12,45
based and created reservoir system
capable of providing enough water to


370
0:21:12,45 --> 0:21:15,3
fill in olympic sized swimming pool


371
0:21:15,3 --> 0:21:16,36
hand free five sec


372
0:21:16,36 --> 0:21:19,13
to the alhambra popular


373
0:21:19,13 --> 0:21:23,99
it's hard to believe that this was dot
fi handle most eight hundred years ago


374
0:21:23,99 --> 0:21:26,48
but the ny six martin concrete scheme


375
0:21:26,48 --> 0:21:29,59
liza truly ancient design


376
0:21:29,59 --> 0:21:33,28
d'amato what is he still has the same
sign this letter to the


377
0:21:33,28 --> 0:21:36,58
the only thing that has changed since
the in metairie


378
0:21:36,58 --> 0:21:41,43
every year who know me big time


379
0:21:41,43 --> 0:21:44,61
there are two frontgate of that


380
0:21:44,61 --> 0:21:48,16
one of the gates about what is the flow
into the debate that often the opposite


381
0:21:48,16 --> 0:21:50,5
side of the doubt


382
0:21:50,5 --> 0:21:54,99
tell us what it into that it that way


383
0:21:54,99 --> 0:21:58,79
water from this reservoir flows into a
brick line to come out


384
0:21:58,79 --> 0:22:2,45
known isn't perfect here


385
0:22:2,45 --> 0:22:6,29
this ultimately feeds the alhambra


386
0:22:6,29 --> 0:22:10,47
but diverting the river darrow is just
the start of this mammoth project


387
0:22:10,47 --> 0:22:18,11
the canal builders still have to
overcome a major obstacle


388
0:22:18,11 --> 0:22:20,26
polygamy


389
0:22:20,26 --> 0:22:24,86
the reservoir sits in a valley between
three hills


390
0:22:24,86 --> 0:22:27,2
so in order to reach the alhambra


391
0:22:27,2 --> 0:22:31,4
muhammad's engineers need to build a
water channel six kilometers long


392
0:22:31,4 --> 0:22:35,12
that winds through the hills above the
fortress


393
0:22:35,12 --> 0:22:39,8
this has to carry the equivalent of
seven thousand olympic sized swimming


394
0:22:39,8 --> 0:22:39,879
pools


395
0:22:39,879 --> 0:22:44,17
everyday to support the alhambra is
growing population


396
0:22:44,17 --> 0:22:46,839
and will only work if it flows down hill


397
0:22:46,839 --> 0:22:49,49
at a constant gradient


398
0:22:49,49 --> 0:22:50,99
so how can this happen


399
0:22:50,99 --> 0:22:54,11
when there's a hill in the way


400
0:22:54,11 --> 0:22:56,679
this solution is approved one


401
0:22:56,679 --> 0:22:58,96
instead of going over the high ground


402
0:22:58,96 --> 0:23:1,91
they decide to go through it


403
0:23:1,91 --> 0:23:6,48
the builders dega time about one meter
wide and two meters high through the


404
0:23:6,48 --> 0:23:9,71
hillside towards the alhambra


405
0:23:9,71 --> 0:23:12,97
and the natural stability of the
alhambra conglomerate


406
0:23:12,97 --> 0:23:17,0
in shows that there's no danger of
collapse


407
0:23:17,0 --> 0:23:20,79
it must have taken the months to borrow
a channel into the hill next to the


408
0:23:20,79 --> 0:23:21,97
alhambra


409
0:23:21,97 --> 0:23:24,28
known as the hen iran if it


410
0:23:24,28 --> 0:23:28,47
but there is still one great problem
that must be solved


411
0:23:28,47 --> 0:23:32,16
the alhambra sits on a completely
different hill


412
0:23:32,16 --> 0:23:36,49
muhammad's engineers must find a way to
get the water from one hill


413
0:23:36,49 --> 0:23:40,279
to another


414
0:23:40,279 --> 0:23:44,149
to get water from the hill of the henner
arafat next to the alhambra


415
0:23:44,149 --> 0:23:46,36
into the alhambra itself


416
0:23:46,36 --> 0:23:50,54
muhammad's engineers need to cross a
fifteen meet again that separates the


417
0:23:50,54 --> 0:23:52,149
two hills


418
0:23:52,149 --> 0:23:53,35
the solution


419
0:23:53,35 --> 0:23:56,269
and packwood out


420
0:23:56,269 --> 0:24:0,399
and this is where the water from the
tarifa arise if the alhambra


421
0:24:0,399 --> 0:24:1,65
comes across here


422
0:24:1,65 --> 0:24:4,69
and in the old days it used to go across
the us if you have a yahoo which was a


423
0:24:4,69 --> 0:24:9,73
channel which took it all the way into
the center of the alhambra


424
0:24:9,73 --> 0:24:14,71
the icici every alan formed a lifeline
for the alhambra sit it out


425
0:24:14,71 --> 0:24:18,87
from here water flowed to every part of
the alhambra


426
0:24:18,87 --> 0:24:21,95
it provided fresh water for the populace


427
0:24:21,95 --> 0:24:26,549
fed the multitude of water features in
the darkness of the sultans


428
0:24:26,549 --> 0:24:30,5
these cartons were designed to symbolize
the kingdom of granada


429
0:24:30,5 --> 0:24:35,19
over which the self mushrooms


430
0:24:35,19 --> 0:24:39,22
the gardens had a practical function as
well


431
0:24:39,22 --> 0:24:40,59
they were designed


432
0:24:40,59 --> 0:24:44,72
to create an oasis in the heat of the
granada sound


433
0:24:44,72 --> 0:24:49,26
islam originated in the bed sets in an
environment where water was its premium


434
0:24:49,26 --> 0:24:52,85
and the ability to provide warts and for
how quartet


435
0:24:52,85 --> 0:24:55,49
leading eight not to be something


436
0:24:55,49 --> 0:24:59,529
at sixteen eighteen title kal


437
0:24:59,529 --> 0:25:1,99
in fact it's more than desirable


438
0:25:1,99 --> 0:25:5,37
it's of crucial importance


439
0:25:5,37 --> 0:25:7,92
playing wants is very important but i
wasn't affected


440
0:25:7,92 --> 0:25:12,36
he needed to perform ritual conditions
in one eighty standout humber at what


441
0:25:12,36 --> 0:25:14,899
that is ready completely still


442
0:25:14,899 --> 0:25:18,77
even when you have still pulls water is
flowing into those schools


443
0:25:18,77 --> 0:25:20,62
and filling out again


444
0:25:20,62 --> 0:25:24,35
and it's very important in terms of
ritual purity that whole waters of the


445
0:25:24,35 --> 0:25:28,7
continues flowing


446
0:25:28,7 --> 0:25:30,34
to keep the water pure


447
0:25:30,34 --> 0:25:34,21
muhammad's engineers must create a
system that will prevent sediment from


448
0:25:34,21 --> 0:25:40,85
soaking up the channels


449
0:25:40,85 --> 0:25:45,65
their ingenious solution can be found
dotted all over the alhambra


450
0:25:45,65 --> 0:25:46,47
shallow pool


451
0:25:46,47 --> 0:25:49,62
that's designed to slow the watered down


452
0:25:49,62 --> 0:25:50,979
searching the waters coming


453
0:25:50,979 --> 0:25:53,919
zooming down the channel carrying all
this and pieces


454
0:25:53,919 --> 0:25:56,78
and comes to an area where its wide
indeed


455
0:25:56,78 --> 0:25:58,71
was slow slow it down


456
0:25:58,71 --> 0:26:4,95
and uh... stilts and sends them to slow
down for tomato


457
0:26:4,95 --> 0:26:6,19
in this way


458
0:26:6,19 --> 0:26:13,83
the water for the alhambra stockman's
will be kept constantly fresh


459
0:26:13,83 --> 0:26:16,78
too much water can be a fat thing


460
0:26:16,78 --> 0:26:18,26
if the system over loads


461
0:26:18,26 --> 0:26:19,44
it can back up


462
0:26:19,44 --> 0:26:23,98
blocking the channel and stopping the
water from flowing freely


463
0:26:23,98 --> 0:26:25,64
to prevent this from happening


464
0:26:25,64 --> 0:26:30,19
muhammad's engineers decide to install a
safety valve


465
0:26:30,19 --> 0:26:33,9
any excess water that might overload the
icici ac


466
0:26:33,9 --> 0:26:35,9
is funneled along the side channel


467
0:26:35,9 --> 0:26:42,2
that diverts it into an overflow system
built into the walls


468
0:26:42,2 --> 0:26:43,98
and this is where it comes up


469
0:26:43,98 --> 0:26:46,66
the war starts off opinion pam brown


470
0:26:46,66 --> 0:26:48,26
comes down in the park


471
0:26:48,26 --> 0:26:49,86
through they sell for


472
0:26:49,86 --> 0:26:54,74
dumbest travel and joins up with the
river borrowed it


473
0:26:54,74 --> 0:26:59,399
the engineers may have been genius lee
solved the problem of too much water


474
0:26:59,399 --> 0:27:1,67
but not the problem of too little


475
0:27:1,67 --> 0:27:4,879
and it soon became apparent that during
dry seasons


476
0:27:4,879 --> 0:27:8,179
the alhambra could exhaust its water
supply


477
0:27:8,179 --> 0:27:12,98
at the summit of the header aliphatic
stands their solution to the problem


478
0:27:12,98 --> 0:27:16,809
a massive set of russia flies


479
0:27:16,809 --> 0:27:20,96
visa positioned on the high ground so
that gravity can insure a constant flow


480
0:27:20,96 --> 0:27:26,669
of water defeat the gardens


481
0:27:26,669 --> 0:27:31,0
to get the water up to the stress of
lies muhammad's engineers harness it


482
0:27:31,0 --> 0:27:35,3
donkey to a mechanism of interlocking
wooden gears


483
0:27:35,3 --> 0:27:36,76
when it walks in a circle


484
0:27:36,76 --> 0:27:39,58
it turns up horizontal we'll


485
0:27:39,58 --> 0:27:43,46
this in turn rotate sick care attached
to a water wheel


486
0:27:43,46 --> 0:27:46,659
which dips a line of buckets into the
ethic here below


487
0:27:46,659 --> 0:27:51,1
and deposits the water into a reservoir
above


488
0:27:51,1 --> 0:27:55,59
in this way the alhambra zen ginny as
we're able to realize muhammad stream


489
0:27:55,59 --> 0:28:2,419
of an oasis of gotten surrounding the
palace complex protected by his fortress


490
0:28:2,419 --> 0:28:9,0
but muhammad himself will not seen his
dream come to fruition we he dies in


491
0:28:9,0 --> 0:28:25,39
twelve seventy three before his life's
work is complete


492
0:28:25,39 --> 0:28:26,65
behind him


493
0:28:26,65 --> 0:28:34,2
he leaves one great project unfinished


494
0:28:34,2 --> 0:28:38,59
the prime reason he has built a fortress
here in the first place


495
0:28:38,59 --> 0:28:50,96
the nazri palaces


496
0:28:50,96 --> 0:28:54,71
this is the heart of the alhambra


497
0:28:54,71 --> 0:28:58,71
in the one hundred years that followed
muhammad even as he is dead


498
0:28:58,71 --> 0:29:2,16
his successes completed the great
perimeter wall that surrounds the


499
0:29:2,16 --> 0:29:3,2
citadel


500
0:29:3,2 --> 0:29:8,299
began to construct the palace complex
the courthouse his dynasty


501
0:29:8,299 --> 0:29:10,32
each palace is unique


502
0:29:10,32 --> 0:29:15,539
build one after the other by a
succession of sultans


503
0:29:15,539 --> 0:29:19,66
each internet tended to want to feel the
need house or at least renovate existing


504
0:29:19,66 --> 0:29:22,5
passes to make that and mark


505
0:29:22,5 --> 0:29:25,95
so you end up with a sequence of
different buildings


506
0:29:25,95 --> 0:29:30,17
gradually fill out the space
intellectually create a whole network


507
0:29:30,17 --> 0:29:31,34
palisades


508
0:29:31,34 --> 0:29:32,9
we being


509
0:29:32,9 --> 0:29:34,86
the alhambra complex itself


510
0:29:34,86 --> 0:29:38,51
together they form one of the most
impressive palace complex is still


511
0:29:38,51 --> 0:29:41,14
standing in europe today


512
0:29:41,14 --> 0:29:46,59
this is what the alhambra was designed
to protect


513
0:29:46,59 --> 0:29:50,3
but there is one particular palace
designs not just to protect


514
0:29:50,3 --> 0:29:58,39
but to intimidate


515
0:29:58,39 --> 0:30:0,34
thirteen thirty three


516
0:30:0,34 --> 0:30:2,86
a century after its foundation


517
0:30:2,86 --> 0:30:7,58
yusuf the first comes to the throne of
the alhambra


518
0:30:7,58 --> 0:30:11,76
he inherits the mantle of sultan at a
high point in granada is long-running


519
0:30:11,76 --> 0:30:14,25
conflict with the caste indian
christians


520
0:30:14,25 --> 0:30:16,64
who occupy much of spain


521
0:30:16,64 --> 0:30:20,6
iranian he said the fast in the annie
fourteen centuries all the first


522
0:30:20,6 --> 0:30:21,82
highpoint


523
0:30:21,82 --> 0:30:23,96
off the kingdom


524
0:30:23,96 --> 0:30:27,69
uses the fast allies that marini dynasty
in north africa


525
0:30:27,69 --> 0:30:31,14
and appears to be in quite a strong
position vis-a-vis the christian


526
0:30:31,14 --> 0:30:32,8
kingdoms


527
0:30:32,8 --> 0:30:34,809
to the north


528
0:30:34,809 --> 0:30:37,409
alongside his new allies the marines


529
0:30:37,409 --> 0:30:40,82
yusuf launches an attack into custody in
territory


530
0:30:40,82 --> 0:30:45,64
trying to regain some of the land his
forefathers have lost


531
0:30:45,64 --> 0:30:49,66
however granada is ascendancy short
lived


532
0:30:49,66 --> 0:30:54,3
just seven years later king alfonso of
cast steel defeats the muslims of the


533
0:30:54,3 --> 0:30:56,3
battle of the river sound at all


534
0:30:56,3 --> 0:30:58,389
forcing u since allies the marinis


535
0:30:58,389 --> 0:31:1,75
to withdrawal from spain for good


536
0:31:1,75 --> 0:31:5,179
this may explain why the last active use
of strain


537
0:31:5,179 --> 0:31:10,399
is to build a shoots defensive tala the
biggest yet on the alhambra is north


538
0:31:10,399 --> 0:31:11,69
wall


539
0:31:11,69 --> 0:31:14,429
but already accommoda s


540
0:31:14,429 --> 0:31:19,789
this massive tala stands forty five
meters tall


541
0:31:19,789 --> 0:31:22,85
it forms the centerpiece of the brand
new palace


542
0:31:22,85 --> 0:31:32,889
that use of decides to build


543
0:31:32,889 --> 0:31:36,9
in order to shoe horn it into the new
palestinian


544
0:31:36,9 --> 0:31:41,74
usace architects have to extend an
existing tower on the north wall


545
0:31:41,74 --> 0:31:46,55
they shift the existing sentry walk for
the north onto a new wall and extend the


546
0:31:46,55 --> 0:31:50,6
tower another twelve meters out


547
0:31:50,6 --> 0:31:52,84
but use of isn't thinking of defense


548
0:31:52,84 --> 0:31:55,79
he's thinking of his image


549
0:31:55,79 --> 0:31:56,99
his talent


550
0:31:56,99 --> 0:32:5,0
is designed to make a statement


551
0:32:5,0 --> 0:32:9,0
use of the first has just suffered a
terrible defeat


552
0:32:9,0 --> 0:32:12,98
he decides to build a monuments that
will reinforce his power and involve


553
0:32:12,98 --> 0:32:13,82
ability


554
0:32:13,82 --> 0:32:17,0
in the eyes of his people


555
0:32:17,0 --> 0:32:21,87
by building this tyler yusef stamps his
authority in his kingdom


556
0:32:21,87 --> 0:32:25,29
but yusuf isn't just trying to impress
his own people


557
0:32:25,29 --> 0:32:29,48
he wants to establish he's been from
ability in the minds of his christian


558
0:32:29,48 --> 0:32:35,73
enemies the great hall in the palace of
the com artists is compensating for the


559
0:32:35,73 --> 0:32:38,98
way for lack of of military strength


560
0:32:38,98 --> 0:32:43,529
because he has to rely on political and
diplomatic negotiations he needs very


561
0:32:43,529 --> 0:32:47,44
impressive space in which to conduct
those


562
0:32:47,44 --> 0:32:51,81
thousands of tourists aruba wellness by
the same sense of all that christian


563
0:32:51,81 --> 0:32:53,58
ambassadors must have felt


564
0:32:53,58 --> 0:32:55,769
when they came to me to sell


565
0:32:55,769 --> 0:33:2,79
because the interior of the complex is
designed to make an impression


566
0:33:2,79 --> 0:33:7,73
this is uses grand palace


567
0:33:7,73 --> 0:33:18,14
at its heart the glory that is the whole
of the ambassadors


568
0:33:18,14 --> 0:33:20,559
everything in this overwhelming room


569
0:33:20,559 --> 0:33:24,19
is designed to impress


570
0:33:24,19 --> 0:33:28,49
any visiting ambassador would have been
struck by the sheer scale of the


571
0:33:28,49 --> 0:33:31,12
alhambra


572
0:33:31,12 --> 0:33:34,71
the entire edifice is calculated to
convey an impression of supreme


573
0:33:34,71 --> 0:33:37,85
invincibility


574
0:33:37,85 --> 0:33:41,909
the complex stock homework contains
repeated arabic inscriptions


575
0:33:41,909 --> 0:33:53,36
in praise of allah


576
0:33:53,36 --> 0:33:56,22
almost one my arm and that's right


577
0:33:56,22 --> 0:34:0,2
which is there is no comparable thought
can you see that repeated over and over


578
0:34:0,2 --> 0:34:2,37
and over again


579
0:34:2,37 --> 0:34:4,94
proceedings seventy five feet about


580
0:34:4,94 --> 0:34:9,209
contains more than eight thousand
individual pieces of cd word


581
0:34:9,209 --> 0:34:10,859
painted to resemble


582
0:34:10,859 --> 0:34:13,409
the seven happens of islam


583
0:34:13,409 --> 0:34:15,609
victimized ally is


584
0:34:15,609 --> 0:34:19,669
a microcosm of even if x and sultana can
control it


585
0:34:19,669 --> 0:34:26,269
he is in a sense in control of universe
which is quite a bold statement intimate


586
0:34:26,269 --> 0:34:35,139
he had made a central challenge the
usace architects have to face


587
0:34:35,139 --> 0:34:39,899
they had to impress any ambassador kim
entered this room with the power and


588
0:34:39,899 --> 0:34:42,429
presence of the south


589
0:34:42,429 --> 0:34:43,37
to do that


590
0:34:43,37 --> 0:34:44,799
they needed to focus all


591
0:34:44,799 --> 0:34:48,629
all the attention in the room onto the
sultans thrown in


592
0:34:48,629 --> 0:34:53,679
it's a very striking manipulation of
space to emphasize the fact that you set


593
0:34:53,679 --> 0:34:54,769
the fast


594
0:34:54,769 --> 0:34:58,979
is there enough importance and power and
then he said to be in control of this


595
0:34:58,979 --> 0:35:0,419
indent


596
0:35:0,419 --> 0:35:5,69
to do this the alhambra stock index had
one thing that could help them


597
0:35:5,69 --> 0:35:9,449
mathematics


598
0:35:9,449 --> 0:35:13,839
when the classical world collapsed the
mathematical knowledge used to build the


599
0:35:13,839 --> 0:35:18,26
great monuments of greece and rome was
collected by muslim scholars


600
0:35:18,26 --> 0:35:21,29
and passed down through the muslim
houses of wisdom


601
0:35:21,29 --> 0:35:23,329
at the time of the alhambra


602
0:35:23,329 --> 0:35:25,55
l all of the learning company


603
0:35:25,55 --> 0:35:27,79
and later the woman's


604
0:35:27,79 --> 0:35:30,549
is incorporated into islamic mathematics


605
0:35:30,549 --> 0:35:33,589
they don't reject it because it doesn't
threaten their religion


606
0:35:33,589 --> 0:35:37,849
so here we have this classical legacy of
mathematics


607
0:35:37,849 --> 0:35:42,279
that is not only and how did that then
improved upon


608
0:35:42,279 --> 0:35:46,65
span a muslim architect issues two units
of measurement inherited from classical


609
0:35:46,65 --> 0:35:47,9
architecture


610
0:35:47,9 --> 0:35:50,609
called the russia sheet coder


611
0:35:50,609 --> 0:35:55,159
it was about sixty two centimeters long
than virtually all of the alhambra is


612
0:35:55,159 --> 0:35:59,189
based on this unit of measurement


613
0:35:59,189 --> 0:36:3,569
this late at the heart of the alhambra
st sign


614
0:36:3,569 --> 0:36:7,539
so to create a space that will overwhelm
visitors with the importance of their


615
0:36:7,539 --> 0:36:8,549
sultan


616
0:36:8,549 --> 0:36:11,459
uses architect's design a ground plan


617
0:36:11,459 --> 0:36:15,609
eighteen russia she koto square


618
0:36:15,609 --> 0:36:20,189
they defied the room along its
horizontal in diagonal axes


619
0:36:20,189 --> 0:36:21,409
using strength


620
0:36:21,409 --> 0:36:26,319
fame all count four ninety degree oxfam
wall-to-wall


621
0:36:26,319 --> 0:36:31,199
a straight line between the end points
of the socks creates an off together


622
0:36:31,199 --> 0:36:35,89
this allows them to create a larger
square sitting diagonally across the


623
0:36:35,89 --> 0:36:36,149
original


624
0:36:36,149 --> 0:36:40,599
which marks the location of the central
windows at the entrance


625
0:36:40,599 --> 0:36:44,779
equal actual triangles drawn from the
center of the walls create the perfectly


626
0:36:44,779 --> 0:36:53,18
proportioned width of these windows


627
0:36:53,18 --> 0:36:57,329
very intimidating experience to walk
into the hall of the ambassador's and to


628
0:36:57,329 --> 0:36:58,729
see the full time


629
0:36:58,729 --> 0:36:59,99
position there


630
0:36:59,99 --> 0:37:2,179
century man in that space


631
0:37:2,179 --> 0:37:5,929
generate behind him hannah ran up on
city


632
0:37:5,929 --> 0:37:8,739
and nothing i thought all thought his
territory


633
0:37:8,739 --> 0:37:11,449
how it must have been very impressive
enough that then calculated to


634
0:37:11,449 --> 0:37:13,499
intimidate


635
0:37:13,499 --> 0:37:16,779
for beating both on the inside and the
outside


636
0:37:16,779 --> 0:37:19,919
the tower seems to have done its job


637
0:37:19,919 --> 0:37:24,629
no one dared to attack the alhambra
while yusef was on the throne


638
0:37:24,629 --> 0:37:26,49
in fact he sits down for


639
0:37:26,49 --> 0:37:29,829
would come from a completely unexpected
source


640
0:37:29,829 --> 0:37:32,989
for with great beauty comes great pain


641
0:37:32,989 --> 0:37:37,38
and before the alhambra ca truly fowler
including geo one of the most traumatic


642
0:37:37,38 --> 0:37:43,319
events in its history


643
0:37:43,319 --> 0:37:46,499
nineteenth of october thirteen fifty
four


644
0:37:46,499 --> 0:37:49,979
more than a century after the alhambra
sf ambition


645
0:37:49,979 --> 0:37:54,359
use of the first is preparing for his
daily press


646
0:37:54,359 --> 0:37:55,819
as he does uh...


647
0:37:55,819 --> 0:38:1,539
he is attacked by a deranged slave


648
0:38:1,539 --> 0:38:6,819
capt


649
0:38:6,819 --> 0:38:10,49
command and staff seemed to death


650
0:38:10,49 --> 0:38:13,419
yusef was just thirty six years old


651
0:38:13,419 --> 0:38:17,49
his death paves the way things and on
the defense


652
0:38:17,49 --> 0:38:19,0
to create what may become


653
0:38:19,0 --> 0:38:22,319
the alhambra is greatest monument


654
0:38:22,319 --> 0:38:24,449
just five years into his red


655
0:38:24,449 --> 0:38:30,869
accord chin tries to assassinate the new
south


656
0:38:30,869 --> 0:38:33,249
muhammad flees from his own people


657
0:38:33,249 --> 0:38:36,499
and seeks refuge with granada is oldest
enemy


658
0:38:36,499 --> 0:38:39,769
the christian king of castio


659
0:38:39,769 --> 0:38:42,619
despite his nickname pedro the crew


660
0:38:42,619 --> 0:38:45,219
helps muhammad win back his throne


661
0:38:45,219 --> 0:38:49,449
petr cruel and how much effect really
had a friendship with respect to some


662
0:38:49,449 --> 0:38:50,999
extent instead


663
0:38:50,999 --> 0:38:53,739
intellectual and artistic interests


664
0:38:53,739 --> 0:38:58,119
one could imagine that the team and kate
at had attending friendship beyond the


665
0:38:58,119 --> 0:38:59,269
politics


666
0:38:59,269 --> 0:39:3,49
of here and i think that just underlines
the point that we shouldn't think of


667
0:39:3,49 --> 0:39:5,959
christians and muslims is always at
loggerheads


668
0:39:5,959 --> 0:39:10,749
his friendship with mohammed will change
the alhambra forever


669
0:39:10,749 --> 0:39:12,759
like many spanish kings


670
0:39:12,759 --> 0:39:17,69
pedro is profoundly impressed by the
beauty of muslim architecture


671
0:39:17,69 --> 0:39:19,689
so when he builds a new palace in
seville


672
0:39:19,689 --> 0:39:24,9
he models it on the muslim packing


673
0:39:24,9 --> 0:39:25,82
and when my husband finally


674
0:39:25,82 --> 0:39:29,129
is returned to the throne and goes back
to granada


675
0:39:29,129 --> 0:39:32,959
he spent several years in the company of
another architectural


676
0:39:32,959 --> 0:39:34,9
fan


677
0:39:34,9 --> 0:39:38,9
discussing architecture any brings many
ideas that were developed incidental


678
0:39:38,9 --> 0:39:41,359
back-to-back on that with him this is
very interesting because it means that


679
0:39:41,359 --> 0:39:45,229
the building that we consider the high
point of islamic architecture in spain


680
0:39:45,229 --> 0:39:52,859
always adapt to a christian pallets
insecure


681
0:39:52,859 --> 0:39:54,959
when he returns to the alhambra


682
0:39:54,959 --> 0:39:59,369
muhammad is determined to outdo petraeus
masterpiece in seville


683
0:39:59,369 --> 0:40:4,919
and his triumphant response will be an
architectural tour defaults


684
0:40:4,919 --> 0:40:8,539
with its magnificent courtyard in
breathtaking ceilings


685
0:40:8,539 --> 0:40:12,359
muhammad deficits palace who proved to
be more beautiful


686
0:40:12,359 --> 0:40:13,969
more sophisticated


687
0:40:13,969 --> 0:40:18,229
and more accomplished than the muslim
style masterpiece of his powerful


688
0:40:18,229 --> 0:40:28,459
christian mister


689
0:40:28,459 --> 0:40:30,369
under the reign of muhammad the fish


690
0:40:30,369 --> 0:40:34,359
the age-old rivalry between vannatter
and cast steel takes a radically


691
0:40:34,359 --> 0:40:37,129
different costs


692
0:40:37,129 --> 0:40:40,99
frank status friendship with picture of
casting


693
0:40:40,99 --> 0:40:42,77
military confrontation transforms


694
0:40:42,77 --> 0:40:45,359
into an artistic competition


695
0:40:45,359 --> 0:40:47,92
muhammad commissions the exquisite
palace


696
0:40:47,92 --> 0:40:49,679
and of course of the lions


697
0:40:49,679 --> 0:40:55,69
which seeks to emulate in surpass the
beauty of cadres palace in seville


698
0:40:55,69 --> 0:40:56,4
surfaces


699
0:40:56,4 --> 0:40:58,779
uh... different part thereof


700
0:40:58,779 --> 0:41:1,359
more publicity otherwise


701
0:41:1,359 --> 0:41:6,559
because the test influences so both
islamic atleast ten architect at the


702
0:41:6,559 --> 0:41:8,619
same time


703
0:41:8,619 --> 0:41:9,999
the court of the lions


704
0:41:9,999 --> 0:41:14,279
for many people is the high point of
mastered architecture in the high point


705
0:41:14,279 --> 0:41:16,919
of islamic architecture in spain


706
0:41:16,919 --> 0:41:19,839
it is spatially complex


707
0:41:19,839 --> 0:41:27,89
marie s refine and it brings it all
together in one exquisite space


708
0:41:27,89 --> 0:41:30,519
pia is the crown jewel of the alhambra


709
0:41:30,519 --> 0:41:35,559
built according to a set of rectangles
each related to the other


710
0:41:35,559 --> 0:41:41,269
once again muhammad's architect issues
geometry different effect


711
0:41:41,269 --> 0:41:44,459
when we look at the facade what we see


712
0:41:44,459 --> 0:41:48,879
pain bytes with used to form a school
where


713
0:41:48,879 --> 0:41:54,459
which defines the next level up then we
take the diagonal on that score squeeze


714
0:41:54,459 --> 0:41:59,569
through to the tickle the point the end
of the diana hits the becomes the next


715
0:41:59,569 --> 0:42:3,329
flow within do exactly the same in the
dying from the school


716
0:42:3,329 --> 0:42:8,239
so what you're getting is is the very
precise relationship between one story


717
0:42:8,239 --> 0:42:9,63
high in the next


718
0:42:9,63 --> 0:42:10,979
in accordance with


719
0:42:10,979 --> 0:42:13,649
recruits


720
0:42:13,649 --> 0:42:18,369
elvis looks right to ask because why the
greek architect has come down to us


721
0:42:18,369 --> 0:42:19,53
defines our


722
0:42:19,53 --> 0:42:22,7
sense of beauty nuclear group buildings
and i feel right was because of


723
0:42:22,7 --> 0:42:24,1
presenters


724
0:42:24,1 --> 0:42:26,669
beautiful artefacts


725
0:42:26,669 --> 0:42:29,139
despite these western influences


726
0:42:29,139 --> 0:42:35,939
the palace of the lions remains a
resolutely eastern building


727
0:42:35,939 --> 0:42:39,109
let me say today we don't really see it
as it was


728
0:42:39,109 --> 0:42:40,749
before wondering


729
0:42:40,749 --> 0:42:43,139
program the central balloting


730
0:42:43,139 --> 0:42:46,499
were actually bumpin


731
0:42:46,499 --> 0:42:50,849
the flower beds were in circled by the
sounds of the sultans wives which


732
0:42:50,849 --> 0:42:52,829
overlooked the central garden


733
0:42:52,829 --> 0:42:57,1
you'd had people sitting around the
edges of the court on costanzo pockets


734
0:42:57,1 --> 0:42:58,229
picking


735
0:42:58,229 --> 0:43:2,129
i'd just saying the talks appliances and
shrubs and trees


736
0:43:2,129 --> 0:43:6,449
these rooms contain the palaces most
spectacular tranship


737
0:43:6,449 --> 0:43:8,72
an exquisite form of decoration


738
0:43:8,72 --> 0:43:10,849
known as more cut-outs


739
0:43:10,849 --> 0:43:13,319
with absolutely unique to islam


740
0:43:13,319 --> 0:43:16,829
it's hard to explain where comes from
it's hard to even understand it when you


741
0:43:16,829 --> 0:43:22,139
see it it is so gasoline it it confounds
the senses


742
0:43:22,139 --> 0:43:26,339
you have a sense of it is not wait there
in that it's hard to leave and almost


743
0:43:26,339 --> 0:43:29,14
seems to me is a senior cabinet because
of the interplay


744
0:43:29,14 --> 0:43:32,909
like to say all of these small price


745
0:43:32,909 --> 0:43:35,9
like helen


746
0:43:35,9 --> 0:43:35,86
and again


747
0:43:35,86 --> 0:43:40,669
it's mathematics that creates this
astounding intricacy


748
0:43:40,669 --> 0:43:43,79
hasn't exactly on a trip to the patent


749
0:43:43,79 --> 0:43:48,269
which uses triangles and rectangular
blocks to create its effects


750
0:43:48,269 --> 0:43:53,449
the variety of cuts in the past two work
creates different geometrical shapes


751
0:43:53,449 --> 0:43:55,579
cataracts


752
0:43:55,579 --> 0:43:58,569
the uses set into the wall of the
building with clay


753
0:43:58,569 --> 0:44:2,249
ready for painting plaster work is very
complex


754
0:44:2,249 --> 0:44:8,16
not only because the constant play
between solid and void but also it was


755
0:44:8,16 --> 0:44:12,99
originally paid it it was bright red
bright blue so would have been a very


756
0:44:12,99 --> 0:44:14,329
vibrant scary


757
0:44:14,329 --> 0:44:18,88
the painters use exotic pigments among
them bluegrass you right


758
0:44:18,88 --> 0:44:22,189
extracted from lancaster nasty line in
afghanistan


759
0:44:22,189 --> 0:44:27,709
which cost as much as cold


760
0:44:27,709 --> 0:44:31,6
it's as if the walls of existence had
been completely changed


761
0:44:31,6 --> 0:44:35,9
because overhead is this vault


762
0:44:35,9 --> 0:44:39,599
you cannot comprehend you actually
cannot understand


763
0:44:39,599 --> 0:44:41,969
spatial dimensions are


764
0:44:41,969 --> 0:44:46,389
there is no explain out there that you
can focus her eyes it is


765
0:44:46,389 --> 0:44:56,149
an extraordinary sensory experience


766
0:44:56,149 --> 0:45:0,919
this was to prove the high points for
the muslim kingdom of granada


767
0:45:0,919 --> 0:45:4,759
because a century after muhammad unpaved
roads artistic alliance


768
0:45:4,759 --> 0:45:6,45
but different kind of partnership


769
0:45:6,45 --> 0:45:9,879
would signal the alhambra stand for


770
0:45:9,879 --> 0:45:14,529
in fourteen sixty nine the christian
kingdoms of cast steel and arrogant


771
0:45:14,529 --> 0:45:17,699
unite under ferdinand and isabella


772
0:45:17,699 --> 0:45:22,119
sick historic alliance creates the
kingdom of spain


773
0:45:22,119 --> 0:45:24,14
unmarked suv brutal new phasing


774
0:45:24,14 --> 0:45:30,379
christian policy towards granada


775
0:45:30,379 --> 0:45:36,589
this crusade


776
0:45:36,589 --> 0:45:39,339
on new year's day fourteen ninety-two


777
0:45:39,339 --> 0:45:41,949
after ten long years of war


778
0:45:41,949 --> 0:45:43,9
granada


779
0:45:43,9 --> 0:45:49,579
last muslim bastion in spain finally
