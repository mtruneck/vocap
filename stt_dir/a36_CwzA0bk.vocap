###6 (Ch√∂gyam Trungpa Rinpoche) Spirituality
###10 is a particular term which actually means
###17 a dealing with intuition.
###24 In the theistic tradition
###27 there is a notion of clinging into a word.
###34 A certain act is regarded as
###38 displeasing to our divine principles.
###42 A certain act is regarded as pleasing for the divine whatever.
###50 In the tradition of non-theism, however
###53 it is very direct
###56 that the case history is not particularly important.
###60 What is actually important is here and now.
###66 Now is definitely now.
###69 We try to experience what is available there, on the spot.
###77 There's no point in thinking that a past did exist
###82 that we could have now.
###85 This is now.
###88 This very moment.
###90 Nothing mystical, just now, very simple, straight forward.
###96 And from that nowness, however
###99 arises a sense of intelligence, always
###104 that you are constantly interacting with reality
###109 one by one, spot by spot, constantly.
###113 We actually experience fantastic precision, always.
###120 But we are threatened by the now
###122 so we jump to the past or the future.
###129 Paying attention to the materials that exist in our life
###135 all these choices take place all the time
###139 but none of them are regarded as bad or good per se.
###144 Everything we experience are unconditional experience.
###147 They don't come along with a label by saying
###150 "This is regarded as bad" or "This is good".
###154 We experience them but we don't actually pay heed to them properly.
###160 We don't actually regard that as we are going somewhere.
###164 We regard that as a hassle
###167 waiting to be dead.
###170 [Echoed: waiting to be dead]
###183 That's a problem. And that is not trusting the nowness properly
###189 that what is actually experienced now
###192 possesses a lot of powerful things.
###197 It is so powerful
###200 that we can't face it.
###203 Therefore, we have to borrow from the past, invite the future, all the time
###209 and maybe that's why we seek religion.
###214 Maybe that's why we march in the street.
###219 Maybe that's why we complain to society.
###224 Maybe that's why we vote for the presidents.
###230 It is quite ironical and very funny, indeed.
###523 ZEITGEIST
###548 (J. Maxwell) The more you begin to investigate
###552 what we think we understand, where we came from
###555 what we think we're doing
###558 the more you begin to see we've been lied to.
###561 We've been lied to by every institution. What makes you think
###565 for one minute, that the religious institution
###568 is the only one that's never been touched?
###570 The religious institutions of this world are at the bottom of the dirt.
###578 The religious institutions in this world are put there
###582 by the same people who gave you your government, your corrupt education
###586 who set up your international banking cartels.
###590 We have been misled away from the true and divine presence
###595 in the universe that men have called God.
###598 I don't know what God is but I know what He isn't.
###601 And unless and until you are prepared to look at the whole truth
###606 wherever it may go, whoever it may lead to
###610 the more you educate yourself, the more you understand
###613 where things come from, the more obvious things become
###616 and you begin to see lies everywhere. You have to know the truth
###620 and seek the truth and the truth will set you free.
###623 They must find it difficult...
###627 Those who have taken authority as the truth
###632 rather than truth as the authority.
###635 G. Massey, Egyptologist
###676 (G. Carlin) Because I have to tell you the truth, folks.
###683 When it comes to bullshit
###686 big time, major league bullshit
###689 you have to stand in awe of the all-time champion of false promises
###694 and exaggerated claims: religion!
###700 Think about it. Religion has actually convinced people
###705 that there's an invisible man living in the sky
###709 who watches everything you do, every minute of every day.
###713 And the invisible man has a special list of ten things
###717 he does not want you to do.
###719 And if you do any of these ten things, he has a special place
###723 full of fire and smoke and burning and torture and anguish
###727 where He will send you to live and suffer and burn and choke
###730 and scream and cry forever and ever until the end of time!
###737 But He loves you.
###739 [Laughter and applause]
###745 He loves you.
###750 He loves you and He needs money!
###754 He always needs money!
###757 He's all-powerful, all-perfect, all-knowing, and all-wise;
###760 somehow, just can't handle money!
###765 Religion takes in billions of dollars
###768 they pay no taxes and they always need a little more.
###772 Now, you talk about a good bullshit story.
###775 Holy shit!
###785 PART I:
###789 The Greatest Story Ever Told
###818 (P. Joseph) This is the sun.
###821 As far back as 10,000 BC
###823 history is abundant with carvings and writings reflecting people's respect
###827 and adoration for this object.
###830 And it is simple to understand why, as every morning
###833 the sun would rise, bringing vision, warmth and security
###836 saving man from the cold, blind, predator-filled darkness of night.
###841 Without it, the cultures understood, the crops would not grow
###844 and life on the planet would not survive.
###847 These realities made the sun the most adored object of all time.
###853 Likewise, they were also very aware of the stars.
###857 The tracking of the stars allowed them to recognize and anticipate events
###860 which occurred over long periods of time
###863 such as eclipses and full moons.
###865 They in turn cataloged celestial groups
###867 into what we know today as constellations.
###873 This is the cross of the Zodiac
###875 one of the oldest conceptual images in human history.
###879 It reflects the sun as it figuratively passes
###881 through the 12 major constellations over the course of a year.
###886 It also reflects the 12 months of the year, the four seasons
###889 and the solstices and equinoxes.
###892 The term Zodiac relates to the fact that constellations
###895 were anthropomorphized or personified as figures or animals.
###901 In other words, the early civilizations did not just follow the sun and stars
###905 they personified them with elaborate myths
###907 involving their movements and relationships.
###911 The sun, with its life-giving and saving qualities
###914 was personified as a representative of the unseen creator or God.
###918 God's Sun: the Light of the world, the Savior of human kind.
###923 Likewise, the 12 constellations represented places of travel for God's Sun
###927 and were identified by names, usually representing elements of nature
###930 that happened during that period of time.
###932 For example, Aquarius the water bearer, who brings the spring rains.
###942 This is Horus. He is the Sun God of Egypt of around 3000 BC.
###947 He is the sun, anthropomorphized and his life
###950 is a series of allegorical myths involving the sun's movement in the sky.
###954 From the ancient hieroglyphics in Egypt
###956 we know much about this solar messiah.
###958 For instance, Horus, being the sun or the light
###961 had an enemy known as Set who was the personification
###965 of the darkness or night
###967 and metaphorically speaking, every morning
###970 Horus would win the battle against Set, while in the evening
###973 Set would conquer Horus and send him into the underworld.
###979 It is important to note that 'dark vs. light' or 'good vs. evil'
###982 is one of the most ubiquitous mythological dualities ever known
###987 and is still expressed on many levels to this day.
###990 Broadly speaking, the story of Horus is as follows:
###994 Horus was born on December 25th of the Virgin Isis - Mary
###999 His birth was accompanied by a star in the east
###1002 and upon his birth he was adored by three kings.
###1006 At the age of 12, he was a prodigal child teacher.
###1009 At the age of 30 he was baptized by a figure known as Anup
###1012 and thus began his ministry. Horus had 12 disciples he traveled about with
###1017 performing miracles such as healing the sick and walking on water.
###1020 Horus was known by many gestural names such as The Truth
###1023 The Light, God's Anointed Son, The Good Shepherd
###1026 The Lamb of God and many others.
###1029 After being betrayed by Typhon, Horus was crucified
###1032 buried for 3 days and thus, resurrected.
###1038 These attributes of Horus, whether original or not
###1041 seem to permeate in many cultures of the world for many other gods
###1044 are found to have the same general mythological structure.
###1048 Attis of Phrygia, born of the Virgin Nana on December 25th
###1052 crucified, placed in a tomb and after three days, was resurrected.
###1057 Krishna of India, born of the Virgin Devaki
###1060 with a star in the east signaling his coming.
###1063 He performed miracles with his disciples and upon his death
###1066 was resurrected.
###1070 Dionysus of Greece, born of a virgin on December 25th
###1074 was a traveling teacher who performed miracles such as turning water into wine.
###1078 He was referred to as The King of Kings, God's only begotten son
###1081 the Alpha and Omega and many others. Upon his death
###1085 he was resurrected.
###1087 Mithra of Persia, born of a virgin on December 25th
###1090 had 12 disciples and performed miracles
###1093 upon his death was buried for 3 days and thus resurrected.
###1097 He was also referred to as the truth, the light and many others.
###1100 Interestingly, the sacred day of worship of Mithra was Sunday.
###1107 The fact of the matter is there are numerous saviors
###1110 from different periods from all over the world
###1112 which subscribe to these general characteristics.
###1116 The question remains: why these attributes?
###1119 Why the virgin birth on December 25th?
###1121 Why dead for 3 days and the inevitable resurrection?
###1124 Why 12 disciples or followers?
###1127 To find out, let's examine the most recent of the solar messiahs.
###1134 Jesus Christ was born of the Virgin Mary on December 25th in Bethlehem.
###1137 His birth was announced by a star in the east which Three Kings or Magi
###1140 followed to locate and adore the new savior.
###1143 He was a child teacher at 12. At the age of 30 he was baptized
###1146 by John the Baptist and thus began his ministry.
###1150 Jesus had 12 disciples which he traveled about with performing miracles
###1152 such as healing the sick, walking on water, raising the dead.
###1155 He was also known as the King of Kings, the Son of God, the Light of the World
###1159 the Alpha and Omega, the Lamb of God and many others.
###1161 After being betrayed by his disciple Judas and sold
###1163 for 30 pieces of silver, he was crucified, placed in a tomb
###1166 and after 3 days was resurrected and ascended into heaven.
###1175 First of all, the birth sequence is completely astrological.
###1180 The star in the east is Sirius, the brightest star in the night sky
###1183 which on December 24th aligns with the 3 brightest stars in Orion's belt.
###1189 These 3 bright stars in the Orion's belt are called today
###1191 what they were called in ancient times 'The Three Kings'.
###1196 And the Three Kings and the brightest star, Sirius
###1199 all point to the place of the sunrise on December 25th.
###1203 This is why the Three Kings follow the star in the east
###1207 in order to locate the sunrise, the birth of the Sun.
###1217 The Virgin Mary is the constellation Virgo also known as Virgo the Virgin.
###1221 Virgo in Latin means Virgin.
###1225 Virgo was also referred to as the House of Bread
###1228 and the representation of Virgo is a virgin holding a sheaf of wheat.
###1232 This house of bread and its symbol of wheat
###1234 represents August and September, the time of harvest.
###1237 In turn, Bethlehem literally translates to "house of bread".
###1242 Bethlehem is thus a reference to the constellation Virgo
###1246 a place in the sky, not on earth.
###1249 There's another very interesting phenomenon
###1251 that occurs around December 25th or the winter solstice.
###1254 From the summer solstice to the winter solstice
###1257 the days become shorter and colder.
###1259 And from the perspective of the northern hemisphere
###1261 the Sun appears to move south and gets smaller and more scarce.
###1264 The shortening of the days and expiration of the crops
###1267 when approaching the winter solstice symbolized the process of death
###1271 to the ancients. It was the death of the Sun.
###1277 And by December 22nd the Sun's demise was fully realized.
###1281 For the Sun having moved south continually for six months
###1285 makes it to its lowest point in the sky.
###1288 Here a curious thing occurs:
###1290 The Sun stops moving south, at least perceivably, for three days.
###1296 And during this three day pause, the Sun resides in the vicinity
###1299 of the Southern Cross, or Crux constellation.
###1304 And after this time on December 25th
###1306 the Sun moves one degree, this time north
###1310 foreshadowing longer days, warmth and spring.
###1314 And thus it was said: The Son died on a cross
###1319 was dead for three days, only to be resurrected or born again.
###1324 This is why Jesus and numerous other Sun gods
###1327 share the crucifixion, three-day death and resurrection concept.
###1332 It is the Sun's transition period before it shifts its direction back
###1336 into the northern hemisphere, bringing spring and thus salvation.
###1341 However, they did not celebrate the resurrection of the Sun
###1344 until the spring equinox or Easter.
###1347 This is because at the spring equinox, the Sun officially overpowers
###1351 the evil darkness as daytime thereafter becomes longer in duration
###1356 than the night and the revitalizing conditions of spring emerge.
###1361 Probably the most obvious of all the astrological symbolism
###1364 around Jesus regards the 12 disciples.
###1367 They are simply the 12 constellations of the zodiac
###1370 which Jesus, being the Sun, travels about with.
###1378 In fact, the number 12 is replete throughout the Bible.
###1386 Coming back to the cross of the zodiac, the figurative life of the Sun
###1391 this was not just an artistic expression
###1394 or tool to track the Sun's movement.
###1396 It was also a pagan spiritual symbol
###1400 the shorthand of which looked like this.
###1405 This is not a symbol of Christianity.
###1408 It is a pagan adaptation of the cross of the zodiac.
###1423 This is why Jesus in earlier cult art is always shown
###1426 with his head on the cross for Jesus is the Sun.
###1431 The Son of God, the Light of the World, the risen Savior
###1435 who will come again as it does every morning
###1439 of the glory of God, who defends against the works of darkness
###1444 as he is born again every morning
###1447 and can be seen coming in the clouds
###1450 up in heaven
###1452 with his crown of thorns or sun rays.
###1463 Of the many astrological/astronomical metaphors in the Bible
###1468 one of the most important has to do with the ages.
###1472 Throughout the scriptures, there are numerous references to the age.
###1476 In order to understand this, we need to be familiar with the phenomenon
###1479 known as the precession of the equinoxes.
###1483 The ancient Egyptians, along with cultures long before them
###1486 recognized that approximately every 2150 years
###1489 the sunrise on the morning of the spring equinox
###1492 would occur at a different sign of the zodiac.
###1496 This has to do with a slow angular wobble
###1498 that the Earth maintains as it rotates on its axis.
###1502 It is called a precession because the constellations go backwards
###1505 rather than through the normal yearly cycle.
###1508 The amount of time it takes for the precession to go through all 12 signs
###1511 is roughly 25,765 years.
###1515 This is also called the great year
###1518 and ancient societies were very aware of this
###1520 and they referred to each 2150 year period as an age.
###1527 From 4300 BC - 2150 BC, it was the age of Taurus, the Bull.
###1532 From 2150 BC - 1 AD, it was the age of Aries, the Ram.
###1537 And from 1 AD - 2150 AD, it is the age of Pisces
###1541 the age we are still in to this day.
###1545 And in and around 2150 we will enter the new age
###1548 the age of Aquarius.
###1552 The Bible reflects broadly speaking a symbolic movement
###1556 through three ages while foreshadowing a fourth.
###1560 In the Old Testament when Moses comes down Mount Sinai
###1562 with the Ten Commandments, he is very upset
###1565 to see his people worshiping a golden bull calf.
###1569 In fact, he shattered the stone tablets and instructed his people
###1572 to kill each other in order to purify themselves.
###1576 Most Biblical scholars will attribute this anger to the fact that the Israelites
###1580 were worshiping a false idol or something to that effect.
###1583 The reality is, the golden bull is Taurus the Bull
###1587 and Moses represents the new age of Aries the Ram.
###1591 This is why Jews even today still blow the ram's horn.
###1594 Moses represents the new age of Aries
###1597 and upon the new age everyone must shed the old age.
###1602 Other deities mark these transitions as well such as Mithra
###1605 a pre-Christian god who kills the bull in the same symbology.
###1611 Jesus is the figure who ushers in the age following Aries
###1615 the Age of Pisces or the two fish.
###1619 Fish symbolism is very abundant in the New Testament.
###1622 Jesus feeds 5,000 people with bread and two fish.
###1628 When he begins his ministry walking along Galilee
###1631 he befriends two fishermen who follow him.
###1635 And I think we have all seen the "Jesus fish" on the back of people's cars.
###1638 Little do they know what it actually means.
###1642 It is a pagan astrological symbolism
###1645 for the Sun's kingdom during the age of Pisces.
###1650 Also, Jesus' assumed birth date is essentially the start of this age.
###1657 At Luke 22:10 when Jesus is asked by his disciples
###1660 where the last Passover would be
###1663 Jesus replies "Behold, when ye are entered into the city
###1668 there shall a man meet you bearing a pitcher of water
###1671 follow him into the house where he entereth in."
###1675 This scripture is by far one of the most revealing
###1678 of all the astrological references.
###1681 The man bearing a pitcher of water is Aquarius
###1683 the water-bearer, who is always pictured as a man
###1687 pouring out a pitcher of water.
###1689 He represents the age after Pisces
###1692 and when the Sun (God's Sun) leaves the Age of Pisces (Jesus)
###1696 it will go into the House of Aquarius, as Aquarius follows Pisces
###1700 in the precession of the equinoxes.
###1702 All Jesus is saying is that after the Age of Pisces
###1705 will come the Age of Aquarius.
###1712 We have all heard about the "End Times" and the end of the world.
###1717 The cartoonish depictions in the Book of Revelation aside
###1721 the main source of this idea comes from Matthew 28:20
###1725 where Jesus says "I will be with you even to the end of the world."
###1729 However, in the King James Version, 'world' is a mistranslation
###1734 among many mistranslations.
###1736 The actual word being used is 'aeon', which means 'age'.
###1742 "I will be with you even to the end of the age."
###1745 which is true, as Jesus' Solar Piscean personification will end
###1750 when the Sun enters the Age of Aquarius.
###1752 The entire concept of End Times and the end of the world
###1755 is a misinterpreted astrological allegory.
###1759 Let's tell that to the approximately 100 million people in America
###1764 who believe the end of the world is coming.
###1767 Furthermore, the character of Jesus being a literary
###1770 and astrological hybrid is most explicitly a plagiarization
###1775 of the Egyptian Sun-god Horus.
###1778 For example, inscribed about 3500 years ago
###1782 on the walls of the Temple of Luxor in Egypt
###1785 are images of the enunciation
###1787 the miracle conception, the birth
###1790 and the adoration of Horus.
###1793 The images begin with Thoth announcing to the Virgin Isis
###1796 that she will conceive Horus
###1798 then Kneph, the holy ghost, impregnating the virgin
###1802 and then the virgin birth and the adoration.
###1806 This is exactly the story of Jesus' miracle conception.
###1811 The literary similarities between the Egyptian religion
###1815 and the Christian religion are staggering.
###1828 And the plagiarism is continuous.
###1831 The story of Noah and Noah's Arc is taken directly from tradition.
###1835 The concept of The Great Flood is ubiquitous throughout the ancient world
###1839 with over 200 different cited claims in different periods and times.
###1842 However, one need look no further for a pre-Christian source
###1846 than the Epic of Gilgamesh, written in 2600 BC.
###1851 This story talks of a great flood commanded by God
###1855 an ark with saved animals upon it and even the release
###1858 and return of a dove, all held in common with the Biblical story
###1863 among many other similarities.
###1868 And then there is the plagiarized story of Moses.
###1871 Upon Moses' birth, it is said that he was placed in a reed basket
###1874 and set adrift in a river in order to avoid infanticide.
###1879 He was later rescued by a daughter of royalty and raised by her as a Prince.
###1884 This baby in a basket story was lifted directly
###1887 from the myth of Sargon of Akkad of around 2250 BC.
###1892 Sargon was born, placed in a reed basket in order to avoid infanticide
###1897 and set adrift in a river.
###1899 He was in turn rescued and raised by Akki, a royal mid-wife.
###1904 Furthermore, Moses is known as the Law Giver
###1907 the giver of the Ten Commandments, the Mosaic Law.
###1909 However, the idea of a Law being passed from God to a prophet
###1913 up on a mountain is also a very old motif.
###1917 Moses is just another law giver in a long line of law givers
###1920 in mythological history.
###1921 In India, Manou was the great law giver.
###1924 In Crete, Minos ascended Mount Dicta
###1927 where Zeus gave him the sacred laws.
###1929 While in Egypt there was Mises, who carried stone tablets
###1932 and upon them the laws of God were written.
###1936 Manou. Minos. Mises. Moses.
###1941 And as far as the Ten Commandments, they are taken outright
###1944 from Spell 125 in the Egyptian Book of the Dead.
###1947 What the Book of the Dead phrased "I have not stolen" became "Thou shall not steal".
###1951 "I have not killed" became "Thou shall not kill".
###1954 "I have not told lies" became "Thou shall not bear false witness"
###1958 and so forth.
###1960 In fact, the Egyptian religion is likely the primary foundational basis
###1964 for the Judeo-Christian theology.
###1967 Baptism, afterlife, final judgment, virgin birth
###1971 death and resurrection, crucifixion, the Ark of the Covenant
###1975 circumcision, saviors, Holy Communion
###1978 Great Flood, Easter, Christmas, Passover
###1982 and many more, are all attributes of Egyptian ideas
###1986 long pre-dating Christianity and Judaism.
###1989 Justin Martyr, one of the first Christian historians and defenders, wrote:
###1996 "When we say that he, Jesus Christ, our teacher
###1999 was produced without sexual union, was crucified and died
###2002 and rose again, and ascended into Heaven
###2005 we propound nothing different from what you believe
###2008 regarding those who you esteem Sons of Jupiter."
###2012 In a different writing, Justin Martyr said:
###2014 "He was born of a virgin, accept this in common
###2017 with what you believe of Perseus."
###2020 It's obvious that Justin and other early Christians
###2023 knew how similar Christianity was to the pagan religions.
###2027 However, Justin had a solution.
###2030 As far as he was concerned, the Devil did it.
###2034 The Devil had the foresight to come before Christ
###2037 and create his characteristics in the pagan world.
###2043 (B. Hicks) Fundamentalist Christianity, fascinating!
###2046 These people actually believe the world is 12,000 years old.
###2053 I actually asked one of these guys "OK, dinosaur fossils?"
###2057 He says "Dinosaur fossils?
###2060 God put those here to test our faith!"
###2064 [Laughter]
###2069 "I think God put you here to test my faith, dude!"
###2077 (P. Joseph) The Bible is nothing more than an astro-theological literary hybrid,
###2080 just like nearly all religious myths before it.
###2084 In fact, the aspect of transference of one character's attributes
###2088 to a new character can be found within the book itself.
###2091 In the Old Testament there's the story of Joseph.
###2094 Joseph was a prototype for Jesus.
###2098 Joseph was born of a miracle birth. Jesus was born of a miracle birth.
###2102 Joseph was of 12 brothers. Jesus had 12 disciples.
###2106 Joseph was sold for 20 pieces of silver.
###2108 Jesus was sold for 30 pieces of silver.
###2110 Brother Judah suggests the sale of Joseph.
###2114 Disciple Judas suggests the sale of Jesus.
###2118 Joseph began his work at the age of 30.
###2120 Jesus began his work at the age of 30.
###2123 The parallels go on and on.
###2125 Furthermore, is there any non-Biblical historical evidence of any person
###2130 living with the name Jesus, the Son of Mary
###2132 who traveled about with 12 followers, healing people?
###2136 There are numerous historians who lived in and around the Mediterranean
###2140 either during or soon after the assumed life of Jesus.
###2144 How many of these historians document this figure? Not one.
###2149 However, to be fair, that doesn't mean defenders
###2152 of the historical Jesus haven't claimed the contrary.
###2155 Four historians are typically referenced to justify Jesus' existence.
###2159 Pliny the younger, Suetonius and Tacitus are the first three.
###2163 Each one of their entries consists of only a few sentences at best
###2166 and only refer to 'Christus' or the Christ, which in fact is not a name
###2170 but a title. It means 'The Anointed One'.
###2173 The fourth source is Josephus and this source
###2176 has been proven to be a forgery for hundreds of years.
###2180 Sadly, it is still cited as truth.
###2186 You would think that a guy who rose from the dead
###2188 and ascended into Heaven for all eyes to see
###2191 and performed the wealth of miracles acclaimed to him
###2194 would have made it into the historical record.
###2196 It didn't because once the evidence is weighed
###2199 there are very high odds that the figure known as Jesus
###2202 did not even exist.
###2205 "The Christian religion is a parody on the worship of the sun
###2209 in which they put a man called Christ in the place of the sun
###2212 pay him the adoration originally paid to the sun."
###2215 Thomas Paine (1737-1809)
###2218 (J. Maxwell) We don't want to be unkind, but we want to be factual.
###2222 We don't want to cause hurt feelings
###2225 but we want to be academically correct
###2228 in what we understand and know to be true.
###2231 Christianity just is not based on truth.
###2236 We find that Christianity was in fact nothing more than a Roman story
###2241 developed politically.
###2245 (P. Joseph) The reality is, Jesus was the Solar Deity
###2248 of the Gnostic Christian sect
###2251 and like all other pagan gods, he was a mythical figure.
###2256 It was the political establishment that sought to historize
###2259 the Jesus figure for social control.
###2264 In 325 AD in Rome, Emperor Constantine convened the Council of Nicea.
###2270 It was during this meeting that the politically motivated
###2272 Christian Doctrines were established
###2275 and thus began a long history of religious bloodshed and spiritual fraud.
###2280 And for over the next 1000 years, the Vatican
###2283 maintained a political stranglehold on all of Europe
###2287 leading to such joyous periods as the Dark Ages
###2290 along with enlightening events such as the Crusades and the Inquisition.
###2299 Christianity, along with all other related theologies
###2302 is a historical fraud.
###2305 These religions now serve to detach the species from the natural world
###2309 and likewise, each other.
###2311 They support blind submission to authority.
###2314 They reduce human responsibility to the effect
###2316 that 'God' controls everything and in turn awful crimes
###2320 can be justified in the name of a divine pursuit.
###2324 And most critically, it empowers the political establishment
###2329 who have been using the myth to manipulate and control societies.
###2335 The religious myth is one of the most powerful devices ever created
###2339 and serves as the psychological soil upon which other myths can flourish.
###2349 (D. Griffin) A myth is an idea that, while widely believed, is false.
###2357 In a deeper sense, in the religious sense
###2362 a myth serves as an orienting and mobilizing story for a people.
###2368 The focus is not on the story's relation to reality but on its function.
###2374 A story cannot function, unless it is believed to be true
###2378 in the community or the nation.
###2382 It is not a matter of debate if some people have the bad taste
###2387 to raise the question of the truth of the sacred story.
###2390 The keepers of the faith do not enter into debate with them.
###2394 They ignore them or denounce them as blasphemers.
###2397 It is wrong, blasphemous and sinful for you to suggest, imply
###2401 or help other people come to the conclusion
###2403 that the US government killed 3,000 of its own citizens.
###2410 Part II:
###2413 All the World's a Stage
###2452 (Man on phone) As if a demolition team set off...
###2454 when you see demolitions of these old buildings.
###2456 (Series of 3 reporters) It looks like one of those scenes
###2458 of an old building being purposely blown up.
###2460 Anybody who's ever watched a building being demolished
###2463 on purpose knows that if you're going to do this you have to get
###2466 at the under-infrastructure of a building and bring it down.
###2469 The way the structure is collapsing, this was the result
###2473 of something that was planned. It's not accidental
###2476 that the 1st tower just happened to collapse and then the 2nd tower
###2479 just happened to collapse in exactly the same way.
###2482 How they accomplished this, we don't know.
###2484 (Fireman Casaliggi) The building collapsed to dust.
###2488 You don't find a desk, you don't find a chair
###2492 you don't find a telephone or a computer.
###2495 The biggest piece of a telephone I found
###2497 was half of the keypad and it was about this big.
###2501 - What happened to the concrete? - The concrete was pulverized.
###2504 From river to river there was dust powder, two or three inches thick.
###2508 The concrete was just pulverized!
###2511 (Man on phone) ...reminiscent of those pictures we've all seen too much
###2514 on TV before when a building was deliberately destroyed
###2517 by well-placed dynamite to knock it down.
###2520 - It's as if they had detonators... - Yes, detonators
###2523 -...planned to take down the building, boom, boom...
###2525 I heard a 2nd explosion.
###2527 There was a heavy-duty explosion.
###2529 There was a secondary explosion and then a subsequent collapse.
###2532 ...explosion blew and then it knocked everybody over.
###2534 To me it sounded like an explosion.
###2536 It sounded like gun-fire, bang-bang!
###2539 And then all of a sudden three big explosions.
###2541 ... and we heard big explosion coming down.
###2543 ... and then the entire top of the building just blew up.
###2546 - We saw some kind of explosion. - By the force of the explosions... - big explosion...
###2550 It blew us back into the 8th floor. - We got to the lobby, there was a big explosion.
###2554 The lobby looked as if a bomb had exploded there.
###2556 (Series of 7 witnesses) Huge explosion, now raining debris...
###2559 There's been a huge explosion!!!
###2561 Huge explosion that we all heard and felt.
###2564 We just witnessed some kind of follow up explosion...
###2567 We heard a very loud (It blasted! ) explosion...
###2570 Smoke and secondary explosion in Tower One...
###2573 That is another bomb going off. He thinks that there were actually devices
###2577 that were planted in the building... planted in the building...
###2582 The 9/11 Myth
###2585 19 hijackers, directed by Osama bin Laden, took over 4 commercial jets
###2588 and, while evading the Air Defense System (NORAD), hit 75% of their targets.
###2592 In turn, World Trade Towers 1, 2 & 7 collapsed
###2595 due to structural failure through fire in a 'pancake' fashion
###2598 while the plane that hit the Pentagon vaporized upon impact
###2602 as did the plane that crashed in Shanksville.
###2605 The 911 Commission found that there were no warnings for this act of terrorism
###2609 while multiple government failures prevented adequate defense.
###2613 'no warnings'
###2619 (C. Rice) I don't think anybody could have predicted
###2623 that they would try to use an airplane as a missile
###2625 a hijacked airplane as a missile.
###2627 Nobody in our government at least, and I don't think the prior government
###2629 could have envisioned flying airplanes into buildings.
###2632 No specific threat involving domestic operations
###2635 involving what happened obviously, the cities, airliners and so on.
###2639 There were no warning signs that I'm aware of.
###2643 USAToday reports that in the 2 years before the attacks on September 11th
###2649 NORAD conducted exercises using hijacked airliners as weapons.
###2653 And one target was the World Trade Center.
###2657 Cover of FEMA response manual, 1997.
###2662 Operation "Mascal", Oct. 2000, simulated a plane crash into the Pentagon.
###2667 (Journalist) In confidential documents from the Philippines obtained by CNN
###2671 the plan was clear: He will board any American commercial aircraft
###2675 control its cockpit, and dive it at the CIA headquarters.
###2680 Other buildings targeted included the Pentagon and World Trade Center.
###2683 The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) received 52 warnings
###2688 about Al-Qaeda in the six months before 9/11
###2691 and did not apparently heed them.
###2694 (Journalist) The Pentagon reportedly does not want the public to hear
###2696 next week's Senate Testimony about the former
###2699 secret intelligence unit, known as 'Able Danger'
###2703 And it identified Mohammed Atta and three other 9/11 terrorists
###2707 as members of an Al-Qaeda cell in Brooklyn, New York
###2709 more than a year before the attacks.
###2712 And we found two of the three cells which conducted the 9/11 attacks.
###2715 (Journalist) Lt Colonel Anthony Shaffer, the first member of 'Able Danger'
###2718 to go public, has now been told in writing by the Defense Intelligence Agency
###2722 that it can't speak to members of Congress or their staff without prior approval.
###2726 This is an attempt to prevent the American people
###2729 from knowing the facts about how we could have prevented 9/11
###2733 and people are covering it up today.
###2736 (Journalist) Security and counter-terrorism was blinking red
###2740 in the words of George Tenet, that the warnings of an imminent attack
###2744 were so severe that something dramatic should have been done.
###2747 It was unparalleled. Instead, our president went on a month-long vacation.
###2756 19 Hijackers
###2760 (M. Meacher) The head of Pakistani intelligence (ISI) Mahmood Ahmed
###2765 requested Omar Sheikh to wire
###2768 $100,000 to Mohammed Atta who was the lead hijacker.
###2773 (2 journalists) Hijacker Mohammed Atta received wire transfers via Pakistan.
###2777 The man sending the money to Atta
###2780 is believed to be Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh.
###2783 Omar Sheikh admitted he was supported
###2785 by the Pakistani Government's intelligence service, the ISI.
###2789 No inquiry was ever made as to why General Ahmad ordered $100,000
###2793 to be sent to Mohamed Atta.
###2795 On the morning of September 11, government officials were having breakfast
###2799 with General Ahmad in Washington.
###2802 The 911 Commission deemed the financing of the attacks
###2805 was 'of little practical significance' in their official report.
###2808 (Journalist) As hard as this is to believe, that two of the alleged terrorists
###2812 involved in what happened on Tuesday
###2814 may have attended schools run by U. S. military.
###2817 Evidence was also apparently planted.
###2820 The passport of one of the hijackers
###2822 on Flight 11 was allegedly found in the rubble.
###2825 The hijacker's passport was found blocks
###2827 from the World Trade Center crash site, if you can believe that.
###2830 The 9/11 hijackers are alive and well
###2832 that's according to the chief of Japan's Democratic Party
###2835 who says 9/11 is a hoax.
###2838 Several of these 19 men are still alive.
###2841 "I couldn't believe it when the FBI put me on their list.
###2844 They gave my name and my date of birth but I'm not a suicide bomber.
###2847 I am alive. I have no idea how to fly a plane."
###2850 At least 7 of the hijackers are still alive.
###2854 The FBI has to this day not revised their list.
###2858 At least 5 hijackers are reported as linked to US Military Institutions.
###2867 Osama B. Laden
###2873 Of course we're after Saddam Hussein, I mean bin Laden, he's...
###2877 (Journalist) In the early 80s bin Laden worked with operatives
###2880 from US Intelligence, the Pakistani military and Arab states.
###2885 January 2001. The Bush Administration orders the FBI
###2890 and intelligence agencies to back off investigations
###2894 involving the bin Laden family
###2896 including two of Osama bin Laden's relatives
###2899 who were living, guess where? In Falls Church, Virginia
###2902 right next to CIA headquarters.
###2905 When he was already America's 'most wanted criminal'
###2908 he reportedly spent two weeks in the American hospital in Dubai
###2912 was treated by an American doctor and visited by the local CIA agent.
###2916 We have not seen one piece of evidence that links Osama bin Laden
###2921 directly to the planning stages of September 11th.
###2924 (D. Griffin) This failure to provide proof was later said to be unnecessary
###2927 because bin Laden, in a video allegedly found in Afghanistan
###2931 admitted responsibility for the attacks.
###2934 "I have carefully examined the Pentagon's translation
###2936 which is very problematic. At the most important pieces where it is held
###2939 to prove the guilt of bin Laden, it is not identical with the Arabic."
###2941 Arabist Dr. Abdel EIM Husseini
###2943 "The American translators who listened to the tapes and transcribed them
###2945 apparently wrote a lot of things in that they wanted to hear
###2948 but cannot be heard, no matter how many times you listen to the tapes."
###2951 Gernot Rotter, Prof. of Islamic Studies at University of Hamburg
###2954 In 1976, Osama's older brother Saleem bin Laden
###2959 hired a man in Texas by the name of Jim Bath
###2962 to handle all the investments in the United States for the bin Laden family.
###2966 Jim Bath also happens to be a personal, almost life-long friend
###2969 and former international guard pilot, with George W. Bush.
###2973 The connections between the Bushes and the bin Ladens
###2976 become much more clear when George Herbert Walker Bush
###2979 made trips to Saudi Arabia in 1998 and 2000 to meet with
###2984 the bin Laden family on behalf of a company called the Carlyle Group.
###2990 On the morning of 9/11, the Carlyle Group was having a conference
###2993 in Washington, which included Osama's older brother, Shafig bin Laden.
###2997 The Carlyle Group is linked to the world's largest defense contractors
###3000 which continue to reap massive profits off of the post 9/11 'War on Terrorism'
###3003 and Afghan/Iraq Wars.
###3009 Pentagon
###3013 (Reporter) How could anyone fly a 60 ton, 125 foot wide
###3017 44 foot tall plane through this obstacle course?
###3021 (D. Griffin) The aircraft before striking the Pentagon reportedly executed
###3024 a 270 degree downward spiral
###3028 and yet Hani Hanjour was known as a terrible pilot
###3032 who could not safely fly even a small plane.
###3035 "He didn't care about the fact that he couldn't get through the course."
###3038 "I am still to this day amazed that he could have flown into the Pentagon... "
###3042 - AZ Flight school employee (New York Times Report 5/4/2002)
###3046 (Reporter) No seats, no luggage, no bodies.
###3049 Nothing but bricks and limestone.
###3051 (D. Avery) The official explanation is that the intense heat from the jet fuel
###3054 vaporized the entire plane. Flight 77 had two Rolls Royce engines
###3058 made of steel and titanium alloy and weighed 6 tons each.
###3062 It is scientifically impossible that 12 tons of steel
###3065 and titanium was vaporized by jet fuel.
###3068 We're also told that the bodies were able to be identified
###3072 either by the fingerprints or by their DNA.
###3076 So what kind of fire can vaporize aluminum and tempered steel
###3080 and yet leave human bodies intact?
###3083 (Reporter) From my close-up inspection there's no evidence of a plane
###3087 having crashed anywhere near the Pentagon
###3089 and the only pieces left that you can see
###3092 are small enough that you can pick up in your hand.
###3095 (D. Griffin) Shortly after the strike, government agents
###3097 picked up debris and carried it off.
###3099 The entire lawn was covered with dirt and gravel
###3103 so that any remaining forensic evidence was literally covered up.
###3107 The videos from security cameras which would show
###3110 what really hit the Pentagon were immediately confiscated
###3113 by agents of the FBI
###3115 and the Department of Justice has to this day refused to release them.
###3119 If these videos would prove that the Pentagon was really hit by a 757
###3124 most of us would assume the Government would release them.
###3128 [Request Denied]
###3135 Shanksville
###3140 - It looks like there's nothing there except for a hole in the ground.
###3143 - Basically that's right, the only thing you could see from where we were
###3147 was a big gouge in the earth and some broken trees.
###3150 You could see some people working, walking around in the area
###3154 but from where we could see there wasn't much left.
###3156 - Any large pieces of debris at all? - No, there was nothing.
###3159 Nothing that you could distinguish that a plane had crashed there.
###3163 Commercial plane crash in Nigeria
###3168 Flight 93 "Crash" in Shanksville
###3176 The FBI and state police here have confirmed that they have cordoned off
###3179 a second area about 6 to 8 miles away from the crater here.
###3183 This is apparently another debris site.
###3187 Why would debris be located 6 miles away?
###3189 Could that have blown that far away? Seems highly unlikely.
###3198 World Trade Towers 1, 2 & 7
###3203 (D. Griffin) Pancake theory, according to which the fires
###3206 while not melting the steel, heated it up sufficiently
###3209 to cause the floors weakened by the airplane strikes
###3212 to break loose from the steel columns and this started a chain reaction.
###3216 - So, you would expect then from that theory, which is the official theory
###3219 to see a whole stack of floors piled up on top of each other
###3223 and then a spindle of core columns standing too.
###3226 - The core of each of the Twin Towers consisted of 47 massive steel columns.
###3231 If the floors had broken loose from them, these columns
###3233 would have still been sticking up into the air, a thousand feet.
###3237 The plane did not cut all those core columns.
###3240 We designed the buildings to take the impact of the Boeing 707
###3245 hitting the building at any location.
###3247 The building probably could sustain multiple impacts of jetliners.
###3253 - ...that the plane flew straight into the building. - Straight through, right.
###3257 - So you're saying that the building was actually designed to cope
###3259 with a hole like that and then still survive? - Yes, it was.
###3263 - If you would drop, say a billiard ball
###3266 from the top of the World Trade Center, 110 floors up there
###3269 it would have taken 8 to 10 seconds to hit the ground
###3272 encountering no resistance whatsoever.
###3275 (D. Avery) The Twin Towers came down in nearly free fall speed.
###3278 200,000 tons of steel shatters and explodes outwards over 500 feet.
###3282 - This means that floors shattered at an average rate
###3286 of about ten floors per second.
###3288 - There is no scenario for a pancake effect of buildings falling
###3291 that allows them to fall at a rate of free fall.
###3294 Now what can do that? What can move mass out of the way?
###3296 Explosives.
###3305 47 huge steel columns going up the core that are interconnected.
###3310 How do you get them to fail simultaneously so the core disappeared?
###3314 It looks like those core columns were cut.
###3317 (Controlled demolition expert) We do this by cutting the beam
###3320 at an angle.
###3327 World Trade Center core column after the collapse.
###3332 Notice the 'cut' shape and the melted... or 'molten metal'.
###3338 (S. Jones) I started looking at the molten metal.
###3341 All three buildings, both towers in the rubble, in the basement areas
###3345 and Building 7, there were these pools of molten metal.
###3349 For well over 6 weeks after the collapse
###3351 hot spots of 2000¬∞F were documented in the debris.
###3353 That is 500¬∞F hotter than jet fuel can burn
###3357 in the most controlled conditions.
###3359 You'd get down below and you'd see molten steel
###3364 molten steel running down the channel rails
###3367 like you were in a foundry
###3370 like lava of a volcano.
###3372 (D. Avery) The molten steel was found 3, 4 and 5 weeks later
###3376 when the rubble was being removed.
###3378 He said that molten steel was also found underneath World Trade Center 7.
###3382 So I'm looking through the official reports. What do they say
###3385 about the molten metal? They say nothing.
###3389 Wait a minute. This is important evidence.
###3392 Where did that come from?
###3396 (S. Jones) Thermite is so hot that it will just cut through steel
###3400 through structural steel, for example, like a knife through butter.
###3404 The products are molten iron and aluminum oxide
###3408 which goes off primarily as a dust.
###3412 You know, those enormous dust clouds?
###3414 You can imagine, when you assemble these chemicals on a large scale.
###3422 - So, professor Niels Harrit, you examined the rubble
###3425 that came from the World Trade Center. What did you find in it?
###3429 - In there, we find remains
###3432 of what we characterize as a thermitic material.
###3435 This is very energetic material
###3438 which can be used either for melting iron
###3442 or it can be designed as an explosive.
###3446 The evidence for controlled demolition is overwhelming.
###3450 I told you that the thermite reaction produced molten iron.
###3453 Molten iron was in pools of molten iron in the rubble
###3459 and the point is that the thermite kept on reacting.
###3462 This was the witches' brew of thermite chemistry.
###3465 Molten metal pools under both towers after they collapsed
###3470 and Building 7, which wasn't even hit by a jet.
###3474 (Reporter) Part of the problem is that most people
###3476 simply don't know much about Building 7
###3478 due to the extraordinary secrecy surrounding this collapse.
###3482 (Reporter) This was a 47-story skyscraper.
###3485 This building fell at 5:25.
###3489 (D. Griffin) It was not hit by a plane.
###3491 This building had fires on only 2 or 3 floors.
###3494 - ... and it was brought down by what we know was a controlled demolition.
###3498 - Demolitions look just like that, kink in the middle
###3501 and then that building just comes straight down almost at free fall speed.
###3508 In 2005, The National Institute of Standards and Technology
###3512 released its report on WTC Towers 1 & 2.
###3514 The 10,000 page report does not address the actual collapse.
###3518 In 2008, The National Institute of Standards and Technology
###3522 released its report on WTC Tower 7.
###3524 They did not analyze one piece of steel
###3526 or test a controlled demolition hypothesis.
###3529 Rather, they built a computer model with a predisposition
###3532 that it was a 'fire-induced' collapse.
###3535 The parameters used have not been released.
###3539 While admitting there was a period of 'free fall' for 2.25 sec (8 floors)
###3543 they provide no explanation as to how this is possible
###3546 since their 'progressive collapse' theory is based
###3549 on systemic collisions and triggered failures.
###3554 The Law of Conservation of Momentum simply cannot allow
###3557 for a 'progressive' movement through resistance
###3560 at the rate of 'free fall'.
###3568 Did we review the sub-basement explosions
###3571 which occurred moments before the first plane hit?
###3574 Our office was on the B1 level. As I was talking to a supervisor at 8.46
###3579 and all of a sudden we hear - BOOM!
###3582 (William Rodriguez, 20 year employee of the WTC)
###3585 An explosion so hard that pushed us upwards.
###3588 And it came from the basement, between the B2 level and the B3 level.
###3593 And when I went to verbalize, we hear - BOOM!
###3597 The impact of the plane on the top.
###3600 (Reporter) It would appear as if there's more smoke coming from the ground...
###3604 I was down at the basement, came down, all of a sudden the elevator blew up.
###3608 And as we were coming out, we passed a lobby. There was no lobby
###3611 so I believe the bomb hit the lobby first
###3613 and couple of seconds, then the first plane hit.
###3615 As I'm walking by the main freight car of the building in the corridor
###3620 that's when I got blown.
###3622 I mean, the impact of the explosion threw me to the floor
###3626 and that's when everything started happening.
###3628 All of a sudden a big impact happened again
###3631 and all the ceiling tiles and light fixtures were falling down.
###3634 You have to go clear across the hall from 1 to 2 World Trade Center
###3638 and then all of a sudden it happened all over again.
###3641 Something else hit us to the floor. Right in the basement, you felt it.
###3644 Walls were caving in, everything that was going on...
###3648 I know people that got killed in the basement.
###3650 I know people that got broken legs in the basement.
###3653 People got reconstructive surgery because the walls hit them in the face.
###3660 NORAD (North American Aerospace Defense Command)
###3666 According to standard operating procedure, if an FAA flight control
###3669 notices anything that suggests a possible hijacking
###3672 controllers are to contact their superior. If the problem cannot be fixed
###3676 within about a minute, the superior should ask NORAD
###3678 the North American Aerospace Command to send up
###3681 or scramble jet fighters to find out what is going on.
###3684 NORAD then issues a scramble order
###3686 to the nearest air force base with fighters on alert.
###3688 Although interceptions usually occur within 10 or so minutes
###3692 in this case 80 or so minutes had elapsed
###3696 before fighters were even airborne.
###3698 (Reporter) It's a mind-bending anomaly.
###3700 Not a single US Air Force interceptor turns a wheel until it's too late.
###3705 There are no jets at all.
###3707 What if they were so confused, and had been so deliberately confused
###3711 that they couldn't respond?
###3713 The reason that they didn't know where to go was because a number of conflicting
###3718 and overlapping war game exercises were taking place
###3722 that involved the insertion of false radar blips
###3725 on the radar screens in the north-east air defense sector.
###3728 (FAA) "Hi, Boston Center TMU, we have a problem here.
###3731 We have a hijacked aircraft headed towards New York
###3734 we need someone to scramble some F-16s or something up there to help us out."
###3738 (NORAD) "Is this real world or exercise?"
###3741 There was another exercise, "Vigilant Warrior"
###3744 which was in fact according to a NORAD source
###3746 a live-fly hijack drill being conducted at the same time.
###3750 With only 8 available fighter aircraft
###3752 and they have to be dispatched in pairs
###3755 they were dealing with as many as 22 possible hijacks on the day of 9/11
###3759 and they couldn't separate the war game exercises from the actual hijacks.
###3764 In 2000, NORAD had 67 intercepts. 100% accuracy.
###3768 On 9/11 they failed 4 times in one day.
###3772 In at least one of the many war games going on the morning of 9/11
###3776 planes being flown into buildings was a scenario.
###3784 9/11 Commission
###3789 Page 172: "The US Government has not been able to determine
###3793 the origin of the money used for the 9/11 attacks.
###3796 Ultimately, the question is of little practical significance."
###3799 The American authorities have not managed to trace
###3802 the source of the funding and then the most amazingly
###3806 disingenuous statement: "Ultimately, is it of little consequence".
###3809 It is of massive consequence!
###3812 Doesn't it matter who paid for 9/11?
###3814 (D. Griffin) The collapse of Building 7 has been recognized
###3817 as especially difficult to explain.
###3820 The 9/11 Commission Report implicitly admitted that it could not explain
###3824 the collapse of this building by not even mentioning it.
###3828 - Mr. President, why are you and the Vice President insisting on
###3830 appearing together before the 9/11 Commission?
###3833 - Because the 9/11 Commission wants to ask us questions.
###3836 That's why we are meeting and I look forward to meeting with them
###3838 and answering their questions.
###3840 - The question was, why are you appearing together rather than separately
###3844 which was their request?
###3846 - Because it's a good chance for both of us to answer questions
###3849 that the 9/11 Commission is looking forward to asking us
###3853 and I am looking forward to answering them. Let's see.
###3857 - Do you think they should be able to stand up and speak their own words?
###3860 - They should go under oath. In public!
###3863 When Bush and Cheney met with the 9/11 Commission, they did so
###3866 only on their own terms: They appeared together.
###3869 They were not under oath.
###3871 No press or family members were allowed to attend.
###3873 No recording of any kind was allowed.
###3876 - Don't you think that the families deserve to have a transcript
###3880 or to be able to see... - Adam, you asked me that question yesterday
###3883 and got the same answer.
###3885 - The final report was a unanimous report.
###3888 That means that if there was a single commissioner who had any objection
###3891 about anything, that fact would be dropped from the report.
###3895 - We have found out that he not only served on the transition team
###3899 of the Bush Administration
###3901 that he was a person who wrote a draft memo
###3904 for the setup of the Bush Administration's National Security Council
###3908 that he was an individual who wrote the preemptive war strategy
###3911 that was eventually used for the war on Iraq
###3913 that he's a close friend of Condoleezza Rice's.
###3916 We want him to resign.
###3918 There is literally nothing in the 9/11 Report
###3921 that the Bush Administration did not approve of.
###3924 (D. Griffin) We can understand therefore why the Commission
###3926 under Zelikow's leadership would have ignored all the evidence
###3930 that would point to the truth
###3932 that 9/11 was a false flag operation
###3935 intended to authorize the doctrines and funds
###3938 needed for a new level of imperial mobilization.
###3948 Terrorism
###3951 Terrorism: 1) Systematic use of terror
###3954 manifesting itself in violence or intimidation, for generating fear.
###3959 Armed with knives. Armed with chemical, biological and nuclear weapons.
###3963 Fanatics. Terrorists. September 11th. September 11th. Killers.
###3966 September 11th. Terrorists. Al Qaeda, Terrorists.
###3968 Nuclear weapons. Terror. 9/11. Terror. Evil.
###3971 September 11th. September 11th. The terrorists. War and danger.
###3975 September 11th. Terrorism. Global terrorism. Terrorism. Terrorist
###3979 Terrorist. (Repeated 5 times)
###3982 Terrorists. Terrorism. September 11th. Global terrorism.
###3986 Terrorism. Terrorism. Terrorists. September 11th. World terrorism.
###3990 Terrorism. September 11th. Global Terrorism.
###3992 September the 11th. Terrorist. Terrorist. Terrorist. Terrorist.
###3995 Weapons of mass destruction. September 11th.
###3998 September the 11th. The evil terrorists. Terrorists. Terrorists Know!
###4002 (Journalist) Terrorism. The words are hypnotically repeated:
###4005 Terrorism. Terrorists. Terrorist threat.
###4008 And of course, "believed to be linked to al-Qaeda".
###4013 But, it's the so-called 'War on Terrorism'
###4016 that's in our faces practically 24/7
###4019 as the inescapable focus of our existence.
###4022 (D. Rumsfeld) One day our grandchildren will look back on this time and ask
###4025 "How was the War on Terror won?"
###4028 The entire US ruling class, ruling elite
###4032 comes to see terrorism as the preferred means
###4035 indeed the only means to provide social cohesion
###4039 to provide an enemy image for the society, to keep it together.
###4042 According to neocon theory from Carl Schmitt, you have to have
###4044 an enemy image in order to have a society.
###4047 A very dangerous thing because now it means that the entire social order
###4050 the political parties, intellectual life, politics in general
###4054 are all based on a monstrous myth.
###4056 [Echoed: monstrous myth]
###4064 Terrorism: 2) Technique used by governments
###4067 to manipulate public opinion in order to further an agenda.
###4071 Look, what the CIA has done in this country
###4074 what they have done to us is unbelievable.
###4076 Look at the terrorist acts that have occurred.
###4079 The CIA is behind most if not all of them.
###4081 We had the Marine barracks, their embassy in Kenya.
###4085 We had Pan Am 103. We had the USS Cole.
###4090 We had Oklahoma City. We had the World Trade Center in 1993.
###4095 ...that helped the terrorists to blow up the World Trade Center the first time.
###4100 They built the bomb. They got the driver's license.
###4103 The informer Emad A. Salem, a 43-year-old former Egyptian Army officer
###4109 was given the assignment to put the bomb together
###4112 and he went to his FBI supervisor
###4115 and he said "We're going to put a dummy bomb in here, right?"
###4117 and the FBI supervisor said "No, we're going to put a real bomb."
###4120 (Journalist) FBI agents might have been able to prevent
###4123 last February's deadly explosion at New York's World Trade Center.
###4127 They discussed secretly substituting harmless powder for the explosives
###4131 but they didn't, according to the FBI's own informant Emad Salem.
###4136 Unbeknownst to the FBI at the time
###4138 Salem recorded many of his conversations with his handlers.
###4142 Unfortunately for them, there were only six people killed
###4146 not enough to pass the legislation.
###4148 So, what happened is two years later
###4151 April 19, 1995 down comes Oklahoma City
###4155 the Murrah Building, 168 people killed.
###4158 One year later, the anti-terror legislation, which takes away
###4161 many of our constitutional rights and civil liberties, is passed.
###4165 Madrid, 2004
###4178 7/7/2005 London: 3 trains and a bus were bombed, killing 56 people.
###4185 That morning, an "anti-terror exercise" just happened
###4187 to be taking place as well, dealing with...
###4190 THE EXACT SAME BOMBING SCENARIO
###4192 AT THE EXACT SAME TRAIN STATIONS
###4194 AT THE EXACT SAME TIME.
###4196 - ... because at half past 9 this morning, we were actually running an exercise
###4200 for a company of over a thousand people in London based on simultaneous bombs
###4204 going off precisely at the railway stations where it happened this morning
###4207 so I still have the hairs on the back of my neck standing upright!
###4209 - To get this straight, you were running an exercise to see how you would cope
###4214 with this and it happened while you were running the exercise? - Precisely!
###4217 Yeah... That's right. The exact same bombing at the exact same train stations
###4221 at virtually the same time.
###4223 [We're] supposed to believe it was some kind of coincidence
###4226 that there was also an anti-terrorist drill going on on 7/7.
###4230 And again, just like on 9/11
###4232 they were talking about attacks on the same targets
###4235 the same kind of tube stations at exactly the same time
###4238 as the actual attack happened
###4241 providing some kind of cover for what must be
###4244 operations orchestrated in some way by the State.
###4261 (J. Maxwell) I am absolutely appalled
###4263 at how much people in this country do not think.
###4267 We are given to understand
###4270 that a guy out there up in the mountains
###4273 financed the most elaborate attack on this country.
###4277 (A. Jones) Do you think some people in a cave
###4281 were able to have NORAD stand down?
###4284 Do you think that people in a cave
###4286 were able to have all of this happen?
###4288 (J. Maxwell) And when I think about how many Americans
###4291 were killed in New York City
###4294 and believing as I do that this thing was a set-up job
###4298 this is a textbook operation that Nazis used
###4302 and they've used it over and over again.
###4305 America has been suckered in one more time.
###4312 ("Network" 1976) I don't have to tell you things are bad.
###4315 Everybody knows things are bad.
###4317 The dollar buys a nickel's worth. Banks are going bust.
###4320 Shopkeepers keep a gun under the counter.
###4322 Punks are running wild in the street. There's nobody anywhere
###4325 who seems to know what to do and there's no end to it.
###4328 We know the air is unfit to breathe and our food is unfit to eat.
###4333 We sit watching our TVs while some local newscaster tells us
###4336 that today we had 15 homicides and 63 violent crimes
###4340 as if that's the way it's supposed to be! We know things are bad.
###4343 Worse than bad, they're crazy!
###4345 It's like everything everywhere is going crazy, so we don't go out anymore.
###4349 We sit in the house and slowly the world we're living in is getting smaller
###4352 and all we say is "Please, at least leave us alone in our living rooms.
###4356 Let me have my toaster and my TV, my steel-belted radials
###4359 and I won't say anything. Just leave us alone!"
###4361 Well I'm not going to leave you alone. I want you to get mad!
###4366 I don't want you to protest, I don't want you to riot.
###4368 I don't want you to write to your Congressman because I wouldn't know
###4370 what to tell you to write. I don't know what to do about the depression
###4373 and the inflation and the Russians and the crime in the street.
###4376 All I know is that first you've got to get mad!
###4379 You've got to say "I'm a human being, goddamn it!
###4382 My life has value!"
###4418 (Man on phone) There's smoke, real bad! 105, two tower.
###4425 It's real bad, it's black, it's arid.
###4428 My wife thinks I'm all right. I called and said I was leaving the building.
###4432 I was fine, and then BANG!
###4435 Three of us - two broken windows.
###4438 Oh God!
###4468 (Charles Lindbergh, 1941) When hostilities commenced in Europe in 1939
###4472 it was realized that the American people had no intention of entering the war.
###4478 But they believed that this country could be enticed into the war
###4481 in very much the same way that it was enticed into the last one.
###4486 They planned, first, to prepare the United States for foreign war
###4491 under the guise of American defense.
###4495 Second, to involve us in the war
###4498 step by step, without our realization.
###4502 Third, to create a series of incidents
###4505 which would force us into the actual conflict.
###4508 These plans were, of course, to be covered and assisted
###4512 by the full power of their propaganda.
###4517 Our theaters soon became filled with plays
###4520 portraying the glory of war.
###4522 News reels lost all semblance of objectivity
###4526 and they have used the war
###4528 to justify the restriction of congressional power
###4532 and the assumption of dictatorial procedures
###4535 on the part of the President and his appointees.
###4540 A fear campaign was inaugurated.
###4545 We cannot allow the natural passions and prejudices
###4550 of other peoples, to lead our country to destruction.
###4556 Part III:
###4561 Don't Mind The Men Behind The Curtain
###4568 "Behind the ostensible government sits enthroned an invisible government
###4571 owing no allegiance and acknowledging no responsibility
###4574 to the people." - Theodore Roosevelt
###4576 "The real menace of our republic is the invisible government...
###4578 The little coterie of powerful international bankers virtually runs the US government
###4581 for their own selfish purposes. " John F. Hylan
###4583 "The real truth of the matter is that a financial element in the large centers
###4586 has owned the government since the days of Andrew Jackson." - Franklin D. Roosevelt
###4589 (P. Joseph) 1775, the American Revolutionary War began
###4593 as the American colonies sought to detach from England
###4596 and its oppressive monarchy.
###4598 Though many reasons are cited for the revolution
###4601 one in particular sticks out as a prime cause:
###4604 that King George llI of England outlawed
###4607 the interest-free independent currency
###4609 the colonies were producing themselves
###4612 in turn forcing them to borrow money from the Central Bank of England
###4616 immediately creating economic hardship and despair.
###4619 In the words of Peter Cooper, former vice-president
###4622 of the New York Board of Currency: "After Franklin had explained
###4625 to the British government as the real cause of prosperity
###4627 they immediately passed laws forbidding the payment of taxes in that money.
###4631 This produced such great inconvenience and misery to the people
###4634 that it was the principal cause of the revolution."
###4637 In 1783, America won its independence from England.
###4641 However, its battle against the central bank concept
###4644 and the corrupt, power-hungry mentality associated with it
###4647 had just begun.
###4649 So what is a central bank? A central bank is an institution
###4653 that issues and regulates the currency of an entire nation.
###4656 Based on historical precedent, the typical powers inherent
###4660 in central banking practice include the control of interest rates
###4664 and the expansion and contraction of the money supply itself.
###4667 The Central Bank does not simply issue money to the government.
###4671 It loans it to them with interest.
###4674 Then, through the mechanisms of increasing and decreasing the supply of money
###4678 the Central Bank essentially regulates the value of the currency issued.
###4682 It is critical to understand that the entire structure of this system
###4687 can only produce one thing in the long run: debt.
###4691 It doesn't take a lot of ingenuity to figure this scam out
###4694 for nearly every single dollar produced by both the Central Bank
###4698 and its regulated commercial banks is loaned at interest.
###4702 That means every dollar produced is actually the dollar
###4705 plus a certain percentage of debt based on that dollar.
###4710 And since the banking system has the monopoly of the production
###4713 of the currency and they loan each dollar out
###4716 with an immediate debt attached to it
###4718 where does the money to pay for the debt come from?
###4722 It can only come from the banks again
###4724 which means the banking system has to perpetually increase
###4727 its money supply to temporarily cover the outstanding debt created
###4732 which in turn, since that new money is loaned out at interest
###4736 creates even more debt!
###4738 The end result of this system is essentially slavery
###4742 for it is technically impossible for a government and thus the public
###4746 to ever come out of the self-generating debt.
###4750 "And I sincerely believe... that banking establishments are
###4753 more dangerous than standing armies;
###4756 and that the principle of spending money to be paid by posterity
###4759 under the name of funding, is but swindling futurity on a large scale"
###4763 Letter from Thomas Jefferson to John Taylor (May 28, 1816)
###4766 "Banking was conceived in iniquity and was born in sin.
###4769 The bankers own the Earth... If you wish to remain the slaves of bankers
###4773 and pay the cost of your own slavery, let them continue to create money."
###4777 Sir Josiah Stamp, University of Texas speech, 1927
###4780 By the early 20th century, the US had already implemented and removed
###4784 a few central banking systems, which were maneuvered into place
###4787 by ruthless banking interests.
###4789 At this time, the dominant families in the banking and business world
###4793 were the Rockefellers, the Morgans, the Warburgs, the Rothschilds.
###4798 In the early 1900's, they sought to push once again
###4801 legislation to create another central bank.
###4805 However, they knew the government and public
###4807 were very weary of such an institution.
###4810 They needed to create an incident to affect public opinion.
###4814 JP Morgan, publicly considered a financial luminary at the time
###4818 exploited his mass influence by reportedly creating rumors
###4822 that prominent banks in New York were insolvent, or bankrupt.
###4826 Morgan knew this would trigger mass hysteria and a systemic crisis.
###4830 And it did. The public, in fear of losing their deposits
###4834 immediately began mass withdrawals.
###4836 Consequently, the banks were forced to call in their loans
###4839 causing the recipients to sell their property
###4841 and thus a spiral of bankruptcies, repossessions, and turmoil emerged.
###4847 Putting the pieces together years later, Congressman Charles Lindbergh wrote:
###4851 "The King Bankers put in motion, in 1907, a great scheme.
###4855 They had gambled and speculated on Wall Street
###4857 until so many watered stocks and bonds had been manufactured...
###4861 The King Bankers knew the condition and informed
###4863 the favored of their friends what was to come.
###4865 There was to be a panic in the fall of 1907 that would be advertised
###4869 as the result of our bad banking and currency laws."
###4874 The Panic of 1907 led to a Congressional investigation
###4877 headed by Senator Nelson Aldrich
###4880 who had intimate ties to the financial powers
###4882 and later became part of Rockefeller family through marriage.
###4886 The Commission led by Aldrich recommended a Central Bank
###4889 should be implemented so a panic like 1907 could never happen again.
###4894 This was the spark that the bankers needed to initiate their plan
###4898 and in 1910 a secret meeting was held at JP Morgan estate
###4901 on Jekyll Island off the coast of Georgia.
###4904 It was there where the Central Banking Bill
###4907 called 'The Federal Reserve Act' was written.
###4909 This legislation was written by bankers, not lawmakers.
###4913 This meeting was so secretive, so concealed from government
###4916 and public knowledge that most of the figures who attended
###4919 disguised their names when in route to the island.
###4922 After this bill was constructed, it was then handed over
###4925 to their political frontman, Senator Nelson Aldrich, to push through Congress.
###4930 In 1913, with heavy political sponsorship by the bankers
###4934 Woodrow Wilson became President, having already agreed to sign
###4937 the Federal Reserve Act in exchange for campaign support.
###4941 A few days before Christmas, when much of Congress
###4944 was at home with their families, the Federal Reserve Act was voted in
###4948 and Wilson made it law.
###4950 The night before its passage, Congressman Charles Lindbergh pleaded:
###4954 "This act establishes the most gigantic trust on Earth...
###4957 When the President signs this act, the invisible government
###4960 by the money power will be legalized."
###4964 The public was told that the Federal Reserve System
###4967 was an economic stabilizer and inflation and economic crisis
###4971 were a thing of the past.
###4973 As history has shown, nothing was further from the truth.
###4977 The fact is the bankers now had a streamlined machine
###4980 for economic manipulation.
###4983 (From the movie 'Frankenstein' ,1931) It's alive!
###4987 For example, from 1914 to 1919, the FED substantially increased the money supply
###4993 resulting in extensive loans to small banks and the public.
###4997 Then in 1920, the FED deliberately contracted credit in an extreme way
###5001 thus resulting in banks having to call in large numbers of loans
###5005 and just like 1907, bank runs, bankruptcy and systemic collapse occurred.
###5011 Numerous competitive banks outside of the Federal Reserve System collapsed
###5015 further consolidating the monopoly of the money trust cartel.
###5021 Privy to this scheme, Congressman Charles Lindbergh pronounced:
###5025 "Under the Federal Reserve Act, panics are scientifically created.
###5028 The present panic is the first scientifically created one
###5031 worked out as we figure a mathematical equation."
###5036 However, the panic of 1920 was just a warm-up.
###5039 From 1921 to 1929 the FED again increased the money supply
###5044 resulting once again in extensive loans to the public and banks.
###5048 There was also a fairly new type of loan in the stock market:
###5051 the Broker Call Loan. Very simply
###5054 this loan allowed an investor to put down only a fraction
###5057 of the stock's value, with the rest being loaned from the broker.
###5061 This method was very popular in the roaring '20s
###5064 as everyone seemed to be making money in the market.
###5066 However, there was a catch to this loan.
###5069 It could be called in at any time, and had to be paid within 24 hours.
###5073 and the typical result was the selling of the stock purchased with that loan.
###5078 A few months before October in 1929
###5082 JD Rockefeller, Bernard Baruck, and other insiders
###5085 quietly exited the market, knowing the bubble created was about to burst.
###5089 On October 24th, 1929, the financiers who furnished the call loans
###5094 started calling them in, in mass.
###5097 This sparked an instantaneous massive sell-off in the already inflated market
###5101 as sell orders and margin calls were systemically triggered.
###5104 That then lead to mass bank runs, eventually collapsing thousands of banks
###5109 enabling the large banks to buy up the now failed ones at a discount.
###5116 But it didn't stop there.
###5118 Rather than expanding the money supply in order to recover
###5120 from this economic collapse, the FED actually contracted it
###5125 fueling one of the largest depressions in American history.
###5130 Outraged, Congressman Louis McFadden then Chairman
###5133 of the House Banking Committee filed petition for impeachment
###5136 against the Federal Reserve Board, stating:
###5140 "Mr. Chairman, we have in this country
###5142 one of the most corrupt institutions the world has ever known.
###5145 I refer to the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve banks.
###5149 This evil institution has impoverished and ruined the people
###5152 of the United States... and has practically bankrupted our government.
###5156 It has done this through the defects of the law under which it operates.
###5160 Through the maladministration of that law by the Federal Reserve Board
###5163 and through the corrupt practices of the moneyed vultures who control it."
###5169 Having reduced the society to squalor
###5172 it was then decided that the gold standard should be removed.
###5175 In order to do this, they needed to acquire the remaining gold in the system.
###5179 Under the pretense of helping to end the depression
###5183 came the 1933 gold seizure.
###5185 Under the threat of imprisonment for 10 years, everyone in America
###5188 was required to turn in all gold bullion to the Treasury
###5192 essentially robbing the public of what little real wealth they had left.
###5195 At the end of 1933, the gold standard was abolished.
###5199 If you look at a dollar bill before 1933, it says it is redeemable in gold.
###5204 You look at the dollar bill today, it says it is legal tender
###5207 which means it is backed by absolutely nothing.
###5210 The only thing that gives our money value is the public faith
###5213 and how much of it is in circulation.
###5215 Therefore, the power to regulate the money supply
###5218 is also the power to regulate its value
###5221 which is also the power to manipulate and control entire economies.
###5226 "Whoever controls the volume of money in any country
###5229 is absolute master of all industry and commerce."
###5232 James A. Garfield, 20th president of the United States
###5234 It is important to clearly understand:
###5236 The Federal Reserve is a private corporation.
###5239 It is about as 'federal' as Federal Express.
###5242 It makes its own policies and is under little regulation
###5245 by the US government. It is a private bank
###5247 that loans all the currency at interest to the government
###5251 completely consistent with the central banking model
###5254 that the country sought to escape from when it declared independence
###5257 in the American Revolutionary War.
###5260 Going back to 1913, the Federal Reserve Act was not the only bill
###5264 pushed through Congress for the vested financial interests.
###5267 They also pushed its partner: the federal income tax.
###5271 First of all, the federal income tax is completely unconstitutional
###5275 as it is a direct, unapportioned tax.
###5278 And the required number of states needed in order to ratify
###5281 the amendment to allow the income tax was never legally met
###5285 and this has even been cited in modern court cases.
###5288 "If you were to go back and try to find and review the ratification
###5291 of the 16th amendment... you would find that a sufficient number of states
###5295 never ratified that amendment." - US District Court Judge JC Fox, 2003
###5298 Second, at the present day, roughly 25% of the average worker's income
###5302 is taken from them via this tax.
###5304 That means you work 3 months out of the year to fulfill
###5307 this tax obligation and where does that money go?
###5310 According to the Grace Commission Report of the '80s:
###5314 "100% of what is collected is absorbed solely by interest
###5317 on the federal debt and by federal government contributions
###5321 to transfer payments. In other words, all individual income tax revenues
###5325 are gone before one nickel is spent on the services
###5328 which taxpayers expect from their government."
###5331 Today, the money Americans make working 3 months out of the year
###5334 goes almost entirely to the interest fees
###5337 charged for the debt-based fiat currency.
###5340 The fact is, the Federal Income Tax exists to feed the Federal Reserve
###5345 federal government money machine
###5348 making sure the interest payments are always there.
###5351 And 3) Even with the government claim as to the legality of the income tax
###5356 there is evidently no clear statute.
###5358 No law in existence that requires you to pay this tax.
###5362 (Former IRS agent) I really expected that of course there's a law
###5365 that you can point to in the law book
###5368 a code, that requires you to file tax return. Of course there is!
###5372 I was at that point where I couldn't find the statute
###5375 that clearly made a person liable
###5377 at least not me and most people I know
###5381 and I had no choice in my mind except to resign.
###5384 Based on the research that I did throughout the year 2000
###5388 and that I'm still doing, I have not found that law!
###5390 I've asked Congress, we've asked a lot of people in the IRS
###5393 the IRS Commissioners' helpers. They can't answer
###5397 because if they answer, the American people are going to know
###5400 that this whole thing is a fraud.
###5402 I haven't filed a federal income tax return since I left.
###5406 I have not filed a tax return since 1999.
###5409 (Joseph) Now, the control of the economy and the manipulation of society
###5413 for the vested financial powers is only a part of the game being played.
###5418 Another level is the business of war.
###5422 Since the inception of the Federal Reserve in 1913
###5425 a number of large and small wars have commenced.
###5428 The three most pronounced might be World War I
###5431 World War 2 and Vietnam.
###5433 World War 1: In 1914 European wars broke out
###5437 centered around England and Germany.
###5439 The American public wanted nothing to do with the war.
###5441 In turn, president Woodrow Wilson publicly declared neutrality.
###5445 However, under the surface, evidence now shows
###5448 that the financial powers behind the Administration
###5450 were looking for any excuse it could to enter it.
###5453 It is important to understand that one of the most lucrative things
###5456 that can happen for the bankers is war
###5459 for it forces the country to borrow even more money at interest
###5462 not to mention the profits generated through the financing of military productions.
###5467 In the words of two-time Congressional Medal of Honor winner
###5470 Smedley D. Butler "War is a racket. It always has been.
###5474 It is possibly the oldest, easily the most profitable
###5478 and surely the most vicious. It is the only one international in scope
###5482 and it is the only one in which the profits are reckoned in dollars
###5485 and the losses of lives."
###5487 Woodrow Wilson's top adviser and mentor was Colonel Edward House
###5492 a man found to have intimate connections
###5494 with the financial interests of the time.
###5496 In a conversation between Colonel House, Wilson's adviser
###5499 and Sir Edward Grey, the Foreign Secretary of England
###5502 regarding America and the war, Grey inquired:
###5506 "What will America do if Germans sink an ocean liner
###5508 with American passengers on board? " House responded:
###5511 "I believe that a flame of indignation would sweep the United States
###5514 and that by itself would be sufficient to carry us into war."
###5519 On May 7th 1915, a ship called the 'Lusitania'
###5522 was sent where German military vessels were known to be.
###5526 As likely expected, German U-boats torpedoed the ship
###5529 exploding stored munitions, killing 1200 people.
###5534 To further understand the obvious anticipation of this setup
###5538 the German Embassy actually put advertisements in the New York Times
###5542 telling people that if they boarded the Lusitania they did so at their own risk
###5546 as such a ship sailing from America to England through the war zone
###5549 would be liable to destruction.
###5551 In turn and as anticipated, the sinking of the Lusitania
###5554 created a wave of anger among the American population
###5558 and America entered the war a short time after.
###5562 Major General Smedley D. Butler summarizes
###5564 the monetary reality of World War I:
###5568 "Looking back, Woodrow Wilson was re-elected president in 1916 on a platform
###5571 that he had "kept us out of war". Yet, five months later he asked Congress
###5574 to declare war on Germany... The 4 million young men
###5577 who put on uniforms and marched or sailed away were not asked
###5580 whether they wanted to go forth to suffer and die.
###5582 Then what caused our government to change its mind so suddenly? Money.
###5585 An Allied Commission... came over shortly before the war declaration
###5588 and called on the President, who summoned a group of advisers.
###5591 The head of the Commission spoke. Stripped of its diplomatic language
###5594 this is what he told the President and his group: "There is no use
###5597 kidding ourselves any longer. The cause of the Allies is lost.
###5600 We now owe you American bankers, American munitions makers
###5603 American manufacturers, American speculators, American exporters
###5605 5 or so billion dollars. If we lose (and without the help
###5608 of the US we must lose), we, England, France and Italy
###5611 cannot pay back this money... and Germany won't."
###5613 It has been estimated by statisticians, economists and researchers
###5616 that the war yielded $16 billion in profits. That is how the 21,000 billionaires
###5619 and millionaires got that way. This $16 billion profits is not to be sneezed at.
###5623 It is quite a tidy sum. And it went to very few."
###5625 World War II
###5627 On December 7th 1941, Japan attacked the American fleet at Pearl Harbor
###5631 triggering US entry into that war.
###5634 President Franklin D. Roosevelt declared the attack was:
###5637 'a day that will live in infamy'. A day of infamy indeed
###5641 but not because of the alleged surprise attack on Pearl Harbor.
###5644 After 60 years of surfacing information it is clear
###5647 that not only was the attack known well in advance
###5650 it was outright wanted and provoked.
###5653 In a journal entry by Roosevelt's Secretary of War Henry Stimson
###5657 dated November 25th, 1941, he documented a conversation
###5662 he had with Roosevelt: "The question was how we should maneuver them
###5665 into firing the first shot... " and in Congressional testimony
###5669 he later added: "It was desirable to make sure
###5672 the Japanese be the ones to do this so that there should remain no doubt
###5676 as to who were the aggressors."
###5678 In the months leading up to the attack on Pearl Harbor
###5680 Roosevelt had done almost everything in his power
###5682 to anger the Japanese, showing a posture of aggression.
###5685 He halted all of Japan's imports of American petroleum.
###5689 He froze all the Japanese assets in the United States.
###5691 He made public loans to Nationalist China and supplied military aid
###5695 to the British, both enemies of Japan in the war
###5698 which, by the way, was in complete violation of international war rules.
###5702 With numerous Japanese codes broken in advance
###5705 revealing the plan to attack, on December 7th 1941
###5708 Japan was allowed to attack Pearl Harbor killing 2400 soldiers.
###5714 Before Pearl Harbor, 83% of the American public wanted nothing to do
###5718 with the war. After Pearl Harbor
###5720 one million men volunteered for that war.
###5727 It is important to note, Nazi Germany's war effort was largely supported
###5731 by two organizations, one of which was called IG Farben.
###5734 IG Farben produced 84% of Germany's explosives.
###5738 One of the unspoken partners of IG Farben
###5740 was JD Rockefeller's Standard Oil Company in America.
###5744 The German Air Force could not operate without a special additive
###5748 patented by Rockefeller's Standard Oil.
###5751 The drastic bombing of London by Nazi Germany for example
###5754 was made possible by a $20 million sale of fuel to IG Farben
###5758 by the Rockefeller's Standard Oil Company.
###5761 This is just one small point on the topic of how American businesses
###5764 funded both sides of World War II.
###5767 One other treasonous organization worth mentioning
###5770 is the Union Banking Corporation of New York City.
###5773 Not only did they finance numerous aspects of Hitler's rise to power
###5777 along with actual materials during the war
###5779 it was also a Nazi money laundering bank, which was eventually exposed
###5783 for having millions of dollars of Nazi money in its vaults.
###5787 The Union Banking Corporation of New York was eventually seized
###5790 for violations of the Trading with the Enemy Act.
###5793 Guess who the director and Vice President of the Union Bank was?
###5797 Prescott Bush, the father and grandfather of former US President
###5801 George W. Bush and George HW Bush.
###5806 Vietnam: United States official escalation and entry in the Vietnam War
###5811 came after an alleged incident involving two US destroyers
###5814 being attacked by North Vietnamese PT boats in the Gulf of Tonkin.
###5819 This was known as the Gulf of Tonkin Incident.
###5821 This situation was the catalystic pretext for massive troop deployment
###5825 and full fledged warfare. One problem, however
###5829 the attack on the US destroyers by Vietnamese PT boats
###5833 never happened.
###5835 Former Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara stated years later
###5838 that the Gulf of Tonkin incident was a 'mistake'
###5842 while declassified documents released years later show
###5845 that it was a farce, manipulated for the purposes of war
###5848 and once in the war, it was business as usual.
###5852 In October 1966, President Lyndon Johnson lifted trade restrictions
###5856 on the Soviet Block knowing full well that the Soviets
###5859 were providing upwards of 80% of North Vietnam's war supplies.
###5863 Consequently, the Rockefeller interests financed factories
###5867 in the Soviet Union, which the Soviets used to manufacture
###5869 military equipment and send it to North Vietnam.
###5873 However, the funding of both sides in this conflict
###5876 was only one side of the coin.
###5878 In 1985, Vietnam's Rules of Engagement were declassified.
###5881 This detailed what American troops were and were not allow to do in the war.
###5885 It included such absurdities as: North Vietnamese anti-aircraft missile systems
###5890 could not be bombed until they were known to be fully operational.
###5894 No enemy could be pursued once they crossed
###5896 the border of Laos or Cambodia.
###5898 Most revealing of all, the most critical strategic targets
###5901 were not allow to be attacked, unless initiated by high military officials.
###5906 Apart from these illogical limitations, North Vietnam was informed
###5910 of these restrictions and therefore could base entire strategies
###5913 around the limitations of the American Forces.
###5916 This is why the war went on for so long and the bottom line is this:
###5920 The Vietnam War was never meant to be won, just sustained.
###5925 This war for profit and resources resulted in 58,000 American deaths
###5929 and 3 million dead Vietnamese.
###5934 Where are we now?
###5936 September 11th was the jump-start for a hegemonic agenda
###5940 enabling the possibility of constant global warfare.
###5944 It was a staged war pretext no different than the sinking of the Lusitania
###5948 the provoking of Pearl Harbor and the Gulf of Tonkin lie.
###5952 If 9/11 wasn't a planned war pretext
###5955 it would be an exception to the rule.
###5957 It has been used to launch two unprovoked illegal wars:
###5960 one against Iraq and one against Afghanistan.
###5963 However, 9/11 was the pretext for another war as well.
###5967 The war against you. The Patriot Act
###5969 Homeland Security, the Military Tribunals Act
###5972 and other legislations are all completely designed
###5975 to destroy your civil liberties and protect those in power.
###5980 Currently in the United States, unannounced to most Americans
###5983 your home can be searched without a warrant, without you being home.
###5988 You can in turn be detained indefinitely with no charges revealed to you
###5992 no access to a lawyer and legally tortured.
###5995 All under the suspicion that you might be a 'terrorist'.
###6000 If you need a painted picture of what is happening
###6002 let's recognize how history repeats itself.
###6005 In February 1933, Hitler staged the false flag attack
###6009 burning down his own German parliament building the Reichstag
###6013 blaming it on communist terrorists.
###6018 Within the next few weeks he passed the Enabling Act
###6021 which completely eradicated the German constitution
###6023 destroying people's liberties.
###6025 He then led a series of preemptive wars, all justified as necessary
###6030 to maintaining 'homeland security'.
###6036 An evil exists that threatens every man, woman and child
###6040 of this great nation. We must take steps to ensure
###6043 our domestic security and protect our homeland.
###6046 George W. Bush?
###6050 Adolf Hitler
###6053 when announcing the Gestapo to the people.
###6058 On the matter of communism and its front organizations
###6063 should not obscure the issues!
###6067 Our enemy is a radical network of terrorists
###6070 and every government that supports them.
###6076 (P.Joseph) It's time to wake up.
###6078 The people in power go out of their way to make sure
###6081 you are perpetually mislead and manipulated.
###6084 The majorities' perception of reality
###6086 especially in the political arena is not their own.
###6090 It is shrewdly imposed upon them without them even knowing it.
###6094 For example, the public at large now believes the invasions of Iraq
###6098 and the Middle East, along with the resulting instability
###6101 are the consequences of political and military mistakes.
###6104 What the public fails to see is that the destabilization of the Middle East
###6108 is exactly what the Western interests want.
###6112 This war is to be sustained, so the region can be divided up
###6115 domination of the oil maintained, continual profits reaped
###6119 for defense contractors, and most obviously
###6122 permanent military bases established to be used as a launching pads
###6126 against other oil bearing, non-conforming countries, such as Iran.
###6131 For further implication that the Middle East destabilization
###6134 is purely intentional, in 2005, two elite British SAS officers
###6139 were arrested by Iraqi police after being caught driving around
###6143 in their car shooting at civilians while dressed up as Arabs.
###6148 After being arrested and taken to a jail in Basra
###6151 the British army immediately demanded the release of these men.
###6154 When the Basra government refused, British tanks came in
###6157 and physically broke out the men from the Basra prison.
###6161 (L. LaRouche) If you wish to destroy an area, how do you do it?
###6166 There are two ways: You can go in there and bomb it
###6168 but that is not very efficient.
###6170 What you do is you try to get the people in that area to kill each other
###6173 and to destroy there own territory, their own farms.
###6177 And that's what has been done in that area.
###6179 The way in which you destroy an opponent is by getting him
###6183 to destroy himself by dividing his ranks against one another.
###6187 Then you feed both sides, you have agents feeding both sides
###6191 inflaming both sides. And they kill each other off.
###6194 It's time that some of us woke up to this reality.
###6199 To understand that people who try to maintain empires and create empires
###6205 do it by manipulating the people they are trying to conquer.
###6210 (P. Joseph) You might want to ask yourself why the entire culture
###6212 is utterly saturated with mass media entertainment from all sides
###6217 while the educational system in America continues
###6220 its stupefying downward slide
###6222 since the US government decided to take over
###6224 and subsidize the public school system.
###6229 (J. Maxwell) What your government pays for, it gets.
###6232 When we understand that, then we look at government financed
###6237 institutions of education and see the kind of students
###6242 and the kind of education that is being turned out
###6244 by these government-financed schools
###6247 logic will tell you that if what is being turned out in those schools
###6252 was not in accord with what the state and the federal government wanted
###6257 then it would change it.
###6260 The bottom line is that the government is getting what they have ordered.
###6264 They do not want your children to be educated.
###6270 They do not want you to think too much.
###6274 That is why our country and our world
###6276 has become so proliferated with entertainments
###6280 mass media, television shows
###6283 amusement parks, drugs, alcohol
###6287 and every kind of entertainment, to keep the human mind entertained.
###6292 So that you don't get in the way of important people
###6296 by doing too much thinking.
###6299 You had better wake up and understand that there are people
###6303 who are guiding your life and you don't even know it.
###6306 We are in a lot of trouble!
###6309 Because you people
###6311 and 62 million other Americans are listening to me right now.
###6315 Because less than 3 percent of you people read books.
###6321 Because less than 15 percent of you read newspapers.
###6324 Because the only truth you know is what you get over this tube.
###6328 Right now there is a whole, an entire generation that never knew anything
###6333 that didn't come out of this tube.
###6336 This tube is the gospel, the ultimate revelation.
###6341 This tube can make or break presidents, popes, prime ministers.
###6346 This tube is the most awesome goddamn force in the whole godless world
###6351 and woe is us if it ever falls in the hands of the wrong people.
###6354 And when the largest company in the world
###6356 controls the most awesome goddamn propaganda force
###6361 in the whole godless world who knows what shit
###6364 will be peddled for truth on this network.
###6367 So you listen to me. Listen to me:
###6370 Television is not the truth.
###6373 Television is a goddamned amusement park.
###6375 Television is a circus, a carnival, a traveling troop of acrobats
###6380 story tellers, dancers, singers, jugglers, sideshow freaks
###6383 lion tamers and football players.
###6386 We are in the boredom killing business!
###6388 But you people sit there day after day, night after night
###6393 all ages, colors, creeds... We are all you know!
###6397 You're beginning to believe the illusions we are spinning here.
###6400 You are beginning to think the tube is reality
###6402 and that your own lives are unreal.
###6404 You do whatever the tube tells you. You dress like the tube
###6407 eat like the tube, raise your children like the tube
###6410 you even think like the tube. This is mass madness, you maniacs!
###6415 In God's name you people are the real thing.
###6418 We are the illusion!
###6423 (P. Joseph) The last thing the power establishment wants
###6426 is a conscious informed public capable of critical thinking.
###6430 This is why a continually fraudulent zeitgeist is output
###6434 via religion, the mass media, and the educational system.
###6437 It is in their interest to keep you in a distracted naive bubble.
###6441 And they are doing a damn good job of it.
###6445 This is Aaron Russo, a filmmaker and former politician.
###6449 To his left is Nicholas Rockefeller of the Council on Foreign Relations.
###6454 After maintaining a close friendship with Nicholas Rockefeller
###6457 Aaron eventually ended the relationship, appalled by what he had learned.
###6461 (A. Russo) I got a call one day from an attorney woman I knew
###6465 and she said "Would you like to meet one of the Rockefellers?"
###6468 And I said "Sure, I'd love to."
###6470 And we became friends
###6473 and he began to divulge a lot of things to me
###6476 so he said to me one night:
###6478 "There's going to be an event, Aaron, and out of that event
###6482 you're going to see, we're going to go into Afghanistan
###6484 so we can run pipelines from the Caspian Sea. We are going to go into Iraq
###6488 to take the oil and establish a base in the Middle East
###6491 and we are going to go into Venezuela and get rid of Chavez."
###6495 The first two they have accomplished, Chavez they didn't accomplish.
###6499 And he said "You are going to see guys going into caves
###6503 looking for people they are never going to find. "
###6507 He was laughing about the fact that you have this war on terror
###6511 and there is no real enemy, he was talking about
###6513 how by having this war on terror you can never win it
###6516 because it is an eternal war.
###6519 So you can always keep taking peoples liberties away.
###6522 And I said "How are you going to convince people that this war is real?"
###6526 And he said "By the media, which can convince everybody that it's real. "
###6529 You just keep talking about things, you keep saying them over and over again
###6533 and eventually people believe it.
###6535 You created the Federal Reserve in 1913 through lies.
###6539 You create 9/11, which is another lie.
###6543 Through 9/11, then you are fighting a war on terror
###6545 and all the sudden you go into Iraq, which was another lie
###6549 and now they are going to do Iran.
###6551 It's all one thing leading to another, leading to another...
###6554 I would say to him "What are you doing this for? What's the point of this thing?
###6557 You have all the money you would ever want.
###6559 You have all the power. You're hurting people. It's not a good thing."
###6563 And he would say "What do you care about the people for?
###6566 Take care of yourself and take care of your family."
###6569 And then I said "So what are the ultimate goals here?"
###6573 He said "The ultimate goal is to get everyone in this world
###6576 chipped with an RFID chip.
###6578 And have all money be on those chips and everything on those chips
###6582 and if anybody wants to protest what we do, or violate what we want
###6586 we just turn off their chip."
###6590 (P. Joseph) How far will the sickness of power go?
###6593 To what lengths will those in control go
###6595 in order to maintain and preserve their positions?
###6599 We have a Florida family who are really pioneers in a brave new world.
###6604 They have volunteered to be the first ever
###6607 to have microchip identification devices implanted into their bodies.
###6612 After 9/11, I was really concerned with the security of my family.
###6619 I wouldn't mind having something planted permanently in my arm
###6622 that would identify me.
###6624 (P. Joseph) George Orwell in his famed and possibly prophetic work '1984', stated:
###6630 "Power is not a means, it is an end.
###6633 The object of persecution is persecution.
###6636 The object of torture is torture. The object of power is power."
###6641 Today, symptoms of a surveillance society continue to grow
###6645 as irrational fears of invisible enemies
###6648 coupled with rising economic instability spread across the globe.
###6652 It is under this guise of security that we can foreshadow a world
###6656 where everyone is tracked, everyone is on camera
###6659 and everyone is subordinated.
###6663 The most incredible aspect of all:
###6666 Such totalitarianism would likely not be forced upon the people.
###6669 Rather, the people will demand it.
###6672 For the social manipulation of society through the generation of fear
###6676 and division has completely inhibited the culture.
###6679 Religion, patriotism, race, wealth
###6684 class and every other form of arbitrary separatist identification
###6688 and thus conceit has served to create a controlled population
###6692 utterly malleable in the hands of the few.
###6695 'Divide and Conquer' is the motto
###6697 and as long as people continue to see themselves as separate
###6700 from everything else, they lend themselves to being completely enslaved.
###6706 However, if the people ever realized the truth of their relationship to nature
###6710 and the truth of their personal power to affect change
###6714 the entire manufactured zeitgeist that's preyed upon
###6717 would collapse like a house of cards.
###6733 (R. Alpert) The whole system that we live in
###6736 drills into us that we're powerless, that we're weak
###6740 that our society is evil, that it's crime ridden, etc.
###6743 It's all a big, fat lie!
###6746 We are powerful, beautiful, extraordinary.
###6750 There is no reason why we cannot understand who we truly are
###6755 where we are going. There is no reason why the average individual
###6759 cannot be fully empowered, we are incredibly powerful beings.
###6765 - I think I spent 30 years of my life
###6768 the first 30, trying to become something. I wanted to become good at things
###6772 I wanted to become good at tennis, school and grades
###6775 and everything I viewed in that perspective:
###6777 I'm not OK the way I am, but if I got good at things...
###6782 I realized that I had the game wrong.
###6784 The game was to find out what I already was.
###6810 (R. Albert) Now, in our culture we have been trained
###6812 for individual differences to stand out.
###6814 You look at each person and the immediate hit is:
###6817 brighter, dumber, older, younger, richer, poorer
###6820 and we make all these dimensional distinctions
###6823 put them into categories and treat them that way.
###6825 And we get so that we only see others as separate from ourselves
###6829 in the ways in which they are separate.
###6831 And one of the dramatic characteristics of experience
###6836 is being with another person and suddenly seeing
###6838 the ways in which they are like you, not different from you.
###6842 And experiencing the fact, that which is essence in you
###6845 and which is essence in me, is indeed one.
###6847 The understanding that there is no other. It is all one.
###6856 I wasn't born Richard Albert, I was just born as a human being
###6859 and then I learned this whole business of who I am
###6862 and whether I'm good or bad, achieving or not
###6866 all that's learned along the way.
###6868 "When the power of love overcomes the love of power
###6873 the world will know peace." - Sri Chinmoy Ghose
###6884 (C. Sagan) The old appeals to racial, sexual and religious chauvinism
###6889 to rabid nationalist fervor, are beginning not to work.
###6894 A new consciousness is developing which sees the Earth
###6897 as a single organism and recognizes
###6902 that an organism at war with itself is doomed.
###6938 - Bill Hicks used to finish his shows with this:
###6945 "Life's like a ride in an amusement park
###6948 and when you go on it you think it's real
###6950 because that's how powerful our minds are.
###6952 The ride goes up and down and round and round
###6955 it has thrills and chills and it's very brightly colored.
###6958 And it's very loud and it's fun for a while.
###6961 Some have been on the ride for a long time and they begin to question:
###6965 Is this real? Or is this just a ride?
###6968 And other people have remembered and they come back to us
###6971 and they say: 'Hey, don't worry, don't be afraid ever
###6974 because this is just a ride."
###6978 And we kill those people.
###6980 Shut him up I have got a lot invested in this ride, shut him up!
###6984 Look at my furrows of worry...
###6986 Look at my big bank account and my family. This has to be real.
###6990 It's just a ride. But we will kill those good guys who try and tell us that.
