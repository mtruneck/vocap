Word up Food Tubers, we are going to make
a beautiful, beautiful cocktail that you guys


2
0:0:8,66 --> 0:0:11,549
are going to love to do at home.
The Old Cuban.


3
0:0:11,549 --> 0:0:16,78
It's a twist on a mojito, the most popular
cocktail in the world, it's really light and


4
0:0:16,78 --> 0:0:20,3
gorgeous.
This was invented by Audrey Sanders, the cocktail


5
0:0:20,3 --> 0:0:24,9
queen of the world.
First up we've got a really nice glass like


6
0:0:24,9 --> 0:0:29,42
this. Just a few little ice cubes in there
to chill my glass down. We're using a cocktail


7
0:0:29,42 --> 0:0:33,23
kit, they're really cheap to get and the cheap
ones I find as a beginner are really, really


8
0:0:33,23 --> 0:0:36,289
good.
Okay, the mojito. Cuba, lime!


9
0:0:36,289 --> 0:0:41,379
Half a lime per person.
Give it a good squeeze, turn it around and


10
0:0:41,379 --> 0:0:44,87
give ti another squeeze. Get a nice bit in
there,.


11
0:0:44,87 --> 0:0:48,489
Now we're not using sugar, like a mojito,
we're going to go stock syrup. It's equal


12
0:0:48,489 --> 0:0:54,249
quantities of sugar and water and is so simple.
Just put it in a pan, bring it up to a simmer,


13
0:0:54,249 --> 0:0:58,21
let it clear, turn it off and then just funnel
it into a bottle.


14
0:0:58,21 --> 0:1:2,389
Put a little spout In and then you can be
a cocktail ninja.


15
0:1:2,389 --> 0:1:8,19
25mls into here, beautiful.
Then we're going to go in with some dark rum.


16
0:1:8,19 --> 0:1:13,15
We need about 70mls.
So one 50ml shot and a kiss. That's kiss from


17
0:1:13,15 --> 0:1:16,57
me which is quite a passionate kiss. Do you
know what I mean?


18
0:1:16,57 --> 0:1:20,9
Let's talk about mint. Now this is nice mint.
It's better if you can pick it live. Just


19
0:1:20,9 --> 0:1:26,17
that much.
Give it a spank, full of beautiful fragrance.


20
0:1:26,17 --> 0:1:31,46
Then bitters, just a couple of little drips.
Now we want ice!


21
0:1:31,46 --> 0:1:35,56
That's looking good, now we're going to go
in with our larger part of our metal shaker.


22
0:1:35,56 --> 0:1:45,32
Give it a good spank again.
10 nice shakes is lovely. It's fizzing up


23
0:1:45,32 --> 0:1:51,74
beautifully. We've got a nice chilled glass.
I'm going to use my little strainer here.


24
0:1:51,74 --> 0:1:55,89
You can see we've got little bits of mint
in there and I quite like it. If you don't


25
0:1:55,89 --> 0:2:1,14
you can always sieve ti out!
Look at that! I'm just going to top it up.


26
0:2:1,14 --> 0:2:6,4
I'm going to use prosecco just because I love
prosecco and it is more affordable.


27
0:2:6,4 --> 0:2:9,0
What that Prosecco does is just lighten it
a little bit,


28
0:2:9,0 --> 0:2:13,56
Audrey used dry champagne as she |was trying
to balance the most popular cocktail in the


29
0:2:13,56 --> 0:2:24,2
world with the elegance of champagne and make
something very special.


30
0:2:24,2 --> 0:2:30,67
It's such a beautiful, beautiful, cocktail
if you start knocking those out at a party


31
0:2:30,67 --> 0:2:35,6
people are going to be very, very happy.
And remember this works beautifully with my


32
0:2:35,6 --> 0:2:40,1
recipe. The cured salmon for party season.
Click the box below and you can see how to


33
0:2:40,1 --> 0:2:42,7
make that.
It's an all rounder this one.


34
0:2:42,7 --> 0:2:47,54
So cheers my darling and guys have a go at
that because it will put a smile on your face.


35
0:2:47,54 --> 0:4:47,54
Until next time happy shaking!
