1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:18,734



2
0:0:18,734 --> 0:0:20,706
-Do you still have
your Grime ring?


3
0:0:20,706 --> 0:0:21,29
GRIME: Yeah, man.


4
0:0:21,29 --> 0:0:22,53
What do you think?


5
0:0:22,53 --> 0:0:24,42
That's 10 years old now.


6
0:0:24,42 --> 0:0:29,54
I made that ring 10 years ago.


7
0:0:29,54 --> 0:0:30,24
There it is.


8
0:0:30,24 --> 0:0:31,49
-Yes.


9
0:0:31,49 --> 0:0:33,145



10
0:0:33,145 --> 0:0:35,95
GRIME: You said this was going
to take three hours, you guys


11
0:0:35,95 --> 0:0:37,8
here eating up my Sunday.


12
0:0:37,8 --> 0:0:38,31
-Yes.


13
0:0:38,31 --> 0:0:40,716
GRIME: Hurry the fuck up.


14
0:0:40,716 --> 0:0:42,75
-You're more than welcome
to go and do some stuff.


15
0:0:42,75 --> 0:0:44,47
Bet it would be very interesting
to see you go to


16
0:0:44,47 --> 0:0:44,965
the post office.


17
0:0:44,965 --> 0:0:46,125
GRIME: Fuck you.


18
0:0:46,125 --> 0:0:47,275
-Do you have to go to
the post office?


19
0:0:47,275 --> 0:0:48,35
GRIME: No, fuck you.


20
0:0:48,35 --> 0:0:49,4
-Why?


21
0:0:49,4 --> 0:0:50,28
It's just like your every day.


22
0:0:50,28 --> 0:0:51,22
Anyone can go see you


23
0:0:51,22 --> 0:0:52,616
tattooing or sitting somewhere.


24
0:0:52,616 --> 0:0:53,7
GRIME: They can?


25
0:0:53,7 --> 0:0:54,3
-Yeah.


26
0:0:54,3 --> 0:0:58,47
GRIME: That sounds horrifically
banal.


27
0:0:58,47 --> 0:0:59,43
-All right.


28
0:0:59,43 --> 0:1:0,14
GRIME: All right.


29
0:1:0,14 --> 0:1:2,4
Oh fuck, I don't know.


30
0:1:2,4 --> 0:1:3,69
Now, you didn't tell me
you wanted to look


31
0:1:3,69 --> 0:1:4,95
at a bunch of shit.


32
0:1:4,95 --> 0:1:7,28
Fuck, I don't know.


33
0:1:7,28 --> 0:1:9,11
There's a box laying here.


34
0:1:9,11 --> 0:1:11,19
It's been sitting here for
months with blood all over it.


35
0:1:11,19 --> 0:1:15,46



36
0:1:15,46 --> 0:1:18,516
Some of it's tracing, some
of it's drawings.


37
0:1:18,516 --> 0:1:21,3
I guess some of these
are tracings.


38
0:1:21,3 --> 0:1:22,945
Maybe there's not a
lot of drawings in


39
0:1:22,945 --> 0:1:24,195
here, I don't know.


40
0:1:24,195 --> 0:1:26,9



41
0:1:26,9 --> 0:1:29,235
GRIME: Oh, should I
throw them away?


42
0:1:29,235 --> 0:1:31,806
I'll fucking sell them to
people like you later.


43
0:1:31,806 --> 0:1:35,451
-We could just do a basic sit
down now and then we'll go


44
0:1:35,451 --> 0:1:36,188
rifling through everything.


45
0:1:36,188 --> 0:1:37,76
GRIME: Is that what you think
is going to happen?


46
0:1:37,76 --> 0:1:38,13
-Uh huh.


47
0:1:38,13 --> 0:1:41,11
In my mind, that's how it's
going to play out.


48
0:1:41,11 --> 0:1:45,45
GRIME: What kind of rifling
do you intend to do?


49
0:1:45,45 --> 0:1:47,78
Who are these viewers?


50
0:1:47,78 --> 0:1:51,391
-This'll probably get at
least a million views.


51
0:1:51,391 --> 0:1:53,47
GRIME: All right.


52
0:1:53,47 --> 0:1:56,396
I've got a garage that
fits your desires.


53
0:1:56,396 --> 0:1:56,75
-Really?


54
0:1:56,75 --> 0:1:57,228
In here?


55
0:1:57,228 --> 0:2:0,65
GRIME: Yeah, in here.


56
0:2:0,65 --> 0:2:2,78
All right, are you going
to follow me then?


57
0:2:2,78 --> 0:2:4,19
-Lead on.


58
0:2:4,19 --> 0:2:6,62
GRIME: I don't know how much of
my personal life you need


59
0:2:6,62 --> 0:2:7,87
to have in this thing.


60
0:2:7,87 --> 0:2:10,442



61
0:2:10,442 --> 0:2:13,26
Come on, mister fucking I like
to dig through shit.


62
0:2:13,26 --> 0:2:19,6



63
0:2:19,6 --> 0:2:23,18
Oh, there's a lot
of shit in here.


64
0:2:23,18 --> 0:2:24,22
Oh, you'll want this one.


65
0:2:24,22 --> 0:2:25,15
You got to see this board.


66
0:2:25,15 --> 0:2:28,384
This board's awesome.


67
0:2:28,384 --> 0:2:32,95
Here we go, here we go-- this
is the gem right here.


68
0:2:32,95 --> 0:2:35,54
Yeah, this is Mark Gonzales's
personal board from back in


69
0:2:35,54 --> 0:2:35,79
the day.


70
0:2:35,79 --> 0:2:36,31
-From?


71
0:2:36,31 --> 0:2:40,36
GRIME: Yeah, this is his board
from when he was a kid.


72
0:2:40,36 --> 0:2:43,194
This thing's sick
though, right?


73
0:2:43,194 --> 0:2:46,242
I bought that shit through
the internets.


74
0:2:46,242 --> 0:2:50,26
I bought it fucking cheap.


75
0:2:50,26 --> 0:2:52,13
But, yeah, Mark Gonzales's
personal board.


76
0:2:52,13 --> 0:2:53,54
This thing's so sick.


77
0:2:53,54 --> 0:2:56,345
I got this for like
maybe $200.


78
0:2:56,345 --> 0:2:58,853
It's so stupid to think
it's so cool.


79
0:2:58,853 --> 0:3:0,9
I don't know why people
didn't want it.


80
0:3:0,9 --> 0:3:1,88
They wanted original boards
that were unskated.


81
0:3:1,88 --> 0:3:6,55
I don't see how they lost out on
how cool that is, you know?


82
0:3:6,55 --> 0:3:8,76
HENRY LEWIS: And you see
his board collection.


83
0:3:8,76 --> 0:3:11,59
I mean, if you look at that and
you mix that with modern


84
0:3:11,59 --> 0:3:14,49
tattooing and illustration work,
I think that's where it


85
0:3:14,49 --> 0:3:16,41
all stems from.


86
0:3:16,41 --> 0:3:20,11
Like, his style and his color
schemes in tattooing.


87
0:3:20,11 --> 0:3:23,84
Like, for example, that
biomechanical sleeve.


88
0:3:23,84 --> 0:3:28,28
It has neon pink coming
off of it.


89
0:3:28,28 --> 0:3:31,39
And then the majority of color
that was kind of like a weird


90
0:3:31,39 --> 0:3:36,18
looking baby blue, that crept
into this little organic dark


91
0:3:36,18 --> 0:3:39,34
umber green, going into
olive sappy green.


92
0:3:39,34 --> 0:3:41,33
I think it's based
from old school


93
0:3:41,33 --> 0:3:42,95
'80s skateboard graphics.


94
0:3:42,95 --> 0:3:47,0
And all that whole skater
culture back then when he was


95
0:3:47,0 --> 0:3:48,38
in love with that stuff.


96
0:3:48,38 --> 0:3:51,176
You can tell that's where
he came from.


97
0:3:51,176 --> 0:3:53,483
GRIME: How about that?


98
0:3:53,483 --> 0:3:54,17
-It's nice.


99
0:3:54,17 --> 0:3:57,39
GRIME: This thing's
fucking sick.


100
0:3:57,39 --> 0:3:58,3
How about this thing?


101
0:3:58,3 --> 0:3:59,27
This thing's a fucking gem.


102
0:3:59,27 --> 0:4:0,65
I love this board.


103
0:4:0,65 --> 0:4:2,93
This board's the shit.


104
0:4:2,93 --> 0:4:4,625
Now, this one has such
a good theme.


105
0:4:4,625 --> 0:4:5,79
-I've never even seen it.


106
0:4:5,79 --> 0:4:9,54
GRIME: How about this thing?


107
0:4:9,54 --> 0:4:10,5
Don't touch that.


108
0:4:10,5 --> 0:4:13,105
You can't touch this board.


109
0:4:13,105 --> 0:4:14,31
-I've never seen this color.


110
0:4:14,31 --> 0:4:17,61
GRIME: Yeah, that's because they
made like three of them.


111
0:4:17,61 --> 0:4:20,6
I know for sure there's two
of these that exist--


112
0:4:20,6 --> 0:4:21,0
two.


113
0:4:21,0 --> 0:4:22,89
But I don't know if
there's more.


114
0:4:22,89 --> 0:4:24,24
I got it from the guys
who screened it.


115
0:4:24,24 --> 0:4:27,25
They were trying out
some new primer and


116
0:4:27,25 --> 0:4:28,15
then the black coat.


117
0:4:28,15 --> 0:4:30,75
And the coat, like they sprayed
a bunch of boards and


118
0:4:30,75 --> 0:4:35,7
then they came back the next
morning I think and then they


119
0:4:35,7 --> 0:4:37,61
all reacted.


120
0:4:37,61 --> 0:4:39,53
And they were like fuck it,
we'll print them anyway and


121
0:4:39,53 --> 0:4:41,43
they printed them anyway.


122
0:4:41,43 --> 0:4:44,906
This board's awesome.


123
0:4:44,906 --> 0:4:47,13
GRIME: No, it's not a Chris
Cole graphic, dude.


124
0:4:47,13 --> 0:4:48,85
It's a Rodney Mullen graphic.


125
0:4:48,85 --> 0:4:51,616



126
0:4:51,616 --> 0:4:53,22
When'd you start skating?


127
0:4:53,22 --> 0:4:55,11
Fucking '89?


128
0:4:55,11 --> 0:4:57,236
-Did you have all these boards
when you were younger?


129
0:4:57,236 --> 0:4:59,784
GRIME: No, I had some of them
but I didn't have all of


130
0:4:59,784 --> 0:5:1,86
them-- no, of course.


131
0:5:1,86 --> 0:5:4,68
I grew up in Grand Junction,
Colorado.


132
0:5:4,68 --> 0:5:5,686
-What was your town like?


133
0:5:5,686 --> 0:5:6,965
GRIME: Shit.


134
0:5:6,965 --> 0:5:8,1
-High school was--


135
0:5:8,1 --> 0:5:8,98
GRIME: Shit.


136
0:5:8,98 --> 0:5:9,66
-It was shitty?


137
0:5:9,66 --> 0:5:10,33
GRIME: Stupid.


138
0:5:10,33 --> 0:5:11,755
-What were you into?


139
0:5:11,755 --> 0:5:15,82
GRIME: Skateboarding
and punk rock.


140
0:5:15,82 --> 0:5:16,95
Skateboarding and punk rock.


141
0:5:16,95 --> 0:5:19,4
-Were you always "The Grime?"


142
0:5:19,4 --> 0:5:21,23
GRIME: Yeah.


143
0:5:21,23 --> 0:5:22,24
-Is that a nickname?


144
0:5:22,24 --> 0:5:22,82
GRIME: Yeah.


145
0:5:22,82 --> 0:5:24,786
-Like, when you went to college
did you introduce


146
0:5:24,786 --> 0:5:25,61
yourself as "Grime?"


147
0:5:25,61 --> 0:5:27,84
GRIME: No, no, no.


148
0:5:27,84 --> 0:5:34,44
I used it for my creative
life, my artistic life.


149
0:5:34,44 --> 0:5:37,12
I started doing graffiti when
I was really young.


150
0:5:37,12 --> 0:5:38,34
I was painting my name.


151
0:5:38,34 --> 0:5:42,52
I know that I had a tag running
in Junction that had


152
0:5:42,52 --> 0:5:45,45
my name and next to
it I wrote 1984.


153
0:5:45,45 --> 0:5:48,91
So I had tags running on
a bridge from '84.


154
0:5:48,91 --> 0:5:52,14
And I don't even know why
I did that, really.


155
0:5:52,14 --> 0:5:53,69
I mean, I know it's
like a thing-- you


156
0:5:53,69 --> 0:5:54,6
people do that shit.


157
0:5:54,6 --> 0:5:57,4
But it wasn't like a one-time
thing, it was a thing that I


158
0:5:57,4 --> 0:6:2,63
kind of enjoyed in a weird
way or wanted to do.


159
0:6:2,63 --> 0:6:5,41
I think I enjoyed being
creative, if you will.


160
0:6:5,41 --> 0:6:9,68
But I didn't see a line where
to pull that creativity.


161
0:6:9,68 --> 0:6:14,13
Or how to use it, or that it was
a viable thing outside--


162
0:6:14,13 --> 0:6:16,86
that it could be
an occupation.


163
0:6:16,86 --> 0:6:19,56
It never occurred to me that
I could be an artist as an


164
0:6:19,56 --> 0:6:22,62
occupation, I don't think,
for a long time.


165
0:6:22,62 --> 0:6:25,32
When I was 19, I moved to
Arizona to go to school, get


166
0:6:25,32 --> 0:6:27,4
out of my town.


167
0:6:27,4 --> 0:6:28,91
I'd been there a few times,
and you could


168
0:6:28,91 --> 0:6:30,5
skateboard a lot there.


169
0:6:30,5 --> 0:6:33,89
There was good skateboarding
there, and there was a lot of


170
0:6:33,89 --> 0:6:35,64
year-round skateboarding
because of the weather.


171
0:6:35,64 --> 0:6:37,97
And I figured OK, fuck
it, I'll go there.


172
0:6:37,97 --> 0:6:39,88
But also because I
had been there.


173
0:6:39,88 --> 0:6:42,79
It was familiar, so it felt
easier than like oh, maybe I


174
0:6:42,79 --> 0:6:43,62
should go to San Francisco.


175
0:6:43,62 --> 0:6:45,81
I've never been there,
I should go.


176
0:6:45,81 --> 0:6:49,7
That would have felt
a little too crazy.


177
0:6:49,7 --> 0:6:50,6
So I went there.


178
0:6:50,6 --> 0:6:52,8
And then after a while
I thought oh, I got


179
0:6:52,8 --> 0:6:53,72
to get out of here.


180
0:6:53,72 --> 0:6:58,67
I had a desire to make tattoos
since I was, I don't know,


181
0:6:58,67 --> 0:7:0,11
like maybe 15?


182
0:7:0,11 --> 0:7:3,256
And I remember it surfacing
again maybe when I was 19 to


183
0:7:3,256 --> 0:7:5,31
20 years old.


184
0:7:5,31 --> 0:7:6,9
It surfaced again, and I thought
I'm going to do it,


185
0:7:6,9 --> 0:7:7,43
I'm going to do it.


186
0:7:7,43 --> 0:7:10,89
When I had no idea
how to do it.


187
0:7:10,89 --> 0:7:14,62
It was almost as hard
as figuring out how


188
0:7:14,62 --> 0:7:17,98
to get to the moon.


189
0:7:17,98 --> 0:7:22,73
Oh, God, there's going to
be some gems in here.


190
0:7:22,73 --> 0:7:24,765
This is some early
shit right here.


191
0:7:24,765 --> 0:7:27,39



192
0:7:27,39 --> 0:7:30,73
Oh shit, graffitis.


193
0:7:30,73 --> 0:7:32,12
This is like '90--


194
0:7:32,12 --> 0:7:34,95
oh God, I don't even
know what.


195
0:7:34,95 --> 0:7:37,59
God, this stuff is terrible.


196
0:7:37,59 --> 0:7:41,73
This stuff is just terrible.


197
0:7:41,73 --> 0:7:43,31
Oh shit, first portrait
I ever did.


198
0:7:43,31 --> 0:7:45,11
-What?


199
0:7:45,11 --> 0:7:46,73
You mean Arizona?


200
0:7:46,73 --> 0:7:48,78
GRIME: Yep.


201
0:7:48,78 --> 0:7:50,56
I didn't get very many tattoos
at first because I


202
0:7:50,56 --> 0:7:52,24
didn't have any money.


203
0:7:52,24 --> 0:7:54,69
And I knew the kind of work
I wanted to get and I


204
0:7:54,69 --> 0:7:55,43
couldn't afford it.


205
0:7:55,43 --> 0:7:58,77
So I waited until I got
some money and I got


206
0:7:58,77 --> 0:8:0,2
tattoos that I wanted.


207
0:8:0,2 --> 0:8:3,67



208
0:8:3,67 --> 0:8:8,55
I got tattooed by Marcus and
Guy Aitchison and Eddie


209
0:8:8,55 --> 0:8:10,82
Deutsche and Aaron Cain.


210
0:8:10,82 --> 0:8:13,1
Those are the people I was
getting tattooed by early.


211
0:8:13,1 --> 0:8:16,701



212
0:8:16,701 --> 0:8:19,471
Yeah, I got tattooed
by Marcus in '93.


213
0:8:19,471 --> 0:8:23,2
I came to SF-- it was maybe the
second time I'd been to


214
0:8:23,2 --> 0:8:24,806
San Francisco.


215
0:8:24,806 --> 0:8:30,13
Marcus Pacheco was a huge
influence on me.


216
0:8:30,13 --> 0:8:32,26
And he was one of the reasons
I wanted to start tattooing


217
0:8:32,26 --> 0:8:35,59
anyway, seeing all of his
work in tatt mags.


218
0:8:35,59 --> 0:8:37,67
-Marcus Pacheco owned
Primal Urge.


219
0:8:37,67 --> 0:8:39,169
GRIME: He owned Primal
Urge, yeah.


220
0:8:39,169 --> 0:8:40,39
Yeah, he did.


221
0:8:40,39 --> 0:8:41,377
-And that was what?


222
0:8:41,377 --> 0:8:43,559
GRIME: It was a tattoo
shop, actually.


223
0:8:43,559 --> 0:8:46,186
They made tattoos there
back in the day.


224
0:8:46,186 --> 0:8:47,995
It was in San Francisco,
California.


225
0:8:47,995 --> 0:8:49,335
-Known for traditional
sailor tattoos?


226
0:8:49,335 --> 0:8:50,572
GRIME: Yep.


227
0:8:50,572 --> 0:8:52,54
No, they weren't known
for fucking--


228
0:8:52,54 --> 0:8:54,46
oh, shit the bed.


229
0:8:54,46 --> 0:8:56,5
They were not known
for sailor tatts.


230
0:8:56,5 --> 0:8:58,75
They were known for
very progressive


231
0:8:58,75 --> 0:8:59,74
tattooing at the time.


232
0:8:59,74 --> 0:9:0,94
Very, very progressive
tattooing.


233
0:9:0,94 --> 0:9:2,49
They were doing stuff
that really hadn't


234
0:9:2,49 --> 0:9:3,96
been tried in tattooing.


235
0:9:3,96 --> 0:9:8,98
If it had been, only in really
small increments and in a kind


236
0:9:8,98 --> 0:9:10,5
of unheralded way,
if you will.


237
0:9:10,5 --> 0:9:13,62
CHRIS O'DONNELL: For sure, it
was like a very exciting time


238
0:9:13,62 --> 0:9:14,54
period for San Francisco.


239
0:9:14,54 --> 0:9:20,74
It seemed like a new phase
was about to explode.


240
0:9:20,74 --> 0:9:24,99
I had a stack of magazines back
in the early '90s just


241
0:9:24,99 --> 0:9:26,39
filled with so much garbage.


242
0:9:26,39 --> 0:9:28,84
So much awful work, but there
was some good stuff, too.


243
0:9:28,84 --> 0:9:31,0
And I figured, obviously, I'll
just take all the good stuff


244
0:9:31,0 --> 0:9:32,98
out, put it all in a book.


245
0:9:32,98 --> 0:9:35,83
So yeah, Marcus was doing all
these really interesting


246
0:9:35,83 --> 0:9:37,9
tattoos, very painterly.


247
0:9:37,9 --> 0:9:39,4
Just very unique for the time.


248
0:9:39,4 --> 0:9:41,46
He was really pioneering that
sort of idea that you could do


249
0:9:41,46 --> 0:9:47,3
more with it than just outline
and shade and just things that


250
0:9:47,3 --> 0:9:48,56
nobody else was doing.


251
0:9:48,56 --> 0:9:51,47
Just very complicated work--


252
0:9:51,47 --> 0:9:52,47
very painterly.


253
0:9:52,47 --> 0:9:54,44
I definitely responded
to that really early


254
0:9:54,44 --> 0:9:55,765
on, and so did Grime.


255
0:9:55,765 --> 0:9:57,97
GRIME: For me it was so
attractive and creative.


256
0:9:57,97 --> 0:10:0,505
And his stuff was also
technically always super solid


257
0:10:0,505 --> 0:10:5,37
and super perfect, basically.


258
0:10:5,37 --> 0:10:8,88
That it was a big draw when
you saw something that was


259
0:10:8,88 --> 0:10:13,15
executed so well, it's just
really attractive.


260
0:10:13,15 --> 0:10:14,4
My eyes really liked it.


261
0:10:14,4 --> 0:10:16,49
I was really drawn towards it.


262
0:10:16,49 --> 0:10:17,26
Marcus is the man.


263
0:10:17,26 --> 0:10:18,89
He taught me a ton of things.


264
0:10:18,89 --> 0:10:21,2
I definitely wouldn't be
the tattooer I am if


265
0:10:21,2 --> 0:10:22,495
it wasn't for Marcus--


266
0:10:22,495 --> 0:10:24,61
like, 100%.


267
0:10:24,61 --> 0:10:28,506
Well, we worked together
a few different times.


268
0:10:28,506 --> 0:10:32,57
CHRIS O'DONNELL: In my mind, his
life started when he moved


269
0:10:32,57 --> 0:10:34,346
to San Francisco to work
at Primal Urge.


270
0:10:34,346 --> 0:10:37,322



271
0:10:37,322 --> 0:10:39,681
I can remember him being kind of
quiet back then, actually.


272
0:10:39,681 --> 0:10:42,27



273
0:10:42,27 --> 0:10:43,745
I didn't get a real sense
of his personality


274
0:10:43,745 --> 0:10:45,13
when I first met him.


275
0:10:45,13 --> 0:10:48,39
I think he was just really
involved in getting set up in


276
0:10:48,39 --> 0:10:49,582
San Francisco.


277
0:10:49,582 --> 0:10:52,47
GRIME: I was just focused on
learning how to tattoo.


278
0:10:52,47 --> 0:10:56,52
There was no time to
express myself.


279
0:10:56,52 --> 0:10:59,122
I was too busy studying
tattooing.


280
0:10:59,122 --> 0:11:1,38
I was just drawing and
looking at stuff and


281
0:11:1,38 --> 0:11:4,3
thinking about tattooing.


282
0:11:4,3 --> 0:11:6,43
LANGO OLIVEIRA: I know he was
learning a lot from Marcus.


283
0:11:6,43 --> 0:11:10,82
And Marcus was like the biggest
influence on my work


284
0:11:10,82 --> 0:11:12,675
and at the time like
the biggest idol


285
0:11:12,675 --> 0:11:13,85
and all this stuff.


286
0:11:13,85 --> 0:11:16,73
So I really want to get a tattoo
actually from Marcus.


287
0:11:16,73 --> 0:11:19,0
I tried kind of hard, but
it would never happen.


288
0:11:19,0 --> 0:11:20,215
So I needed to get tattooed.


289
0:11:20,215 --> 0:11:22,94
So it was like fuck it, if this
guy doesn't tattoo me


290
0:11:22,94 --> 0:11:25,4
I'll just get it from this
guy Grime because he


291
0:11:25,4 --> 0:11:27,78
looks pretty good.


292
0:11:27,78 --> 0:11:31,12
This is supposed to be like a
zombie chick or whatever.


293
0:11:31,12 --> 0:11:33,94
I was like 20 years
old or something.


294
0:11:33,94 --> 0:11:35,5
On this one I didn't
say anything.


295
0:11:35,5 --> 0:11:37,14
I was like, dude, just draw
me something sick.


296
0:11:37,14 --> 0:11:38,475
I don't fucking know.


297
0:11:38,475 --> 0:11:41,25
CHRIS O'DONNELL: His style
of tattooing was way more


298
0:11:41,25 --> 0:11:43,4
exaggerated than it is now.


299
0:11:43,4 --> 0:11:45,48
I mean, every detail you could
put into a tattoo, he was


300
0:11:45,48 --> 0:11:47,86
doing more than that.


301
0:11:47,86 --> 0:11:49,92
GRIME: I don't think I suffered
for too long in the


302
0:11:49,92 --> 0:11:51,66
beginning of tattooing.


303
0:11:51,66 --> 0:11:54,415
I think I did pretty well with
the technical side, but it


304
0:11:54,415 --> 0:11:58,736
then takes forever
to get a vision.


305
0:11:58,736 --> 0:12:1,63
CHRIS O'DONNELL: He was just
trying everything.


306
0:12:1,63 --> 0:12:3,5
Grime had a huge buzz.


307
0:12:3,5 --> 0:12:6,55
His work was immediately so
unique that everybody


308
0:12:6,55 --> 0:12:7,29
immediately noticed.


309
0:12:7,29 --> 0:12:9,98
And that was back in the day
when if you had a magazine


310
0:12:9,98 --> 0:12:12,135
article in "International Tattoo
Art," or whatever, it


311
0:12:12,135 --> 0:12:14,85
would get you noticed
in the industry.


312
0:12:14,85 --> 0:12:17,61
Now there's so many magazines
and no one notices if you have


313
0:12:17,61 --> 0:12:18,89
an article anymore.


314
0:12:18,89 --> 0:12:21,5
But back then, that
was a big deal.


315
0:12:21,5 --> 0:12:26,285
And that kind of solidified
his status in the San


316
0:12:26,285 --> 0:12:29,42
Francisco scene.


317
0:12:29,42 --> 0:12:33,54
GRIME: Oh look, that
was in a magazine.


318
0:12:33,54 --> 0:12:34,79
Look, it's so flashy.


319
0:12:34,79 --> 0:12:36,94



320
0:12:36,94 --> 0:12:38,43
-So at the time what'd
you think when you


321
0:12:38,43 --> 0:12:39,275
finished that tattoo?


322
0:12:39,275 --> 0:12:41,94
GRIME: I was psyched.


323
0:12:41,94 --> 0:12:43,92
So were a lot of other people.


324
0:12:43,92 --> 0:12:46,98
So were a lot of other people.


325
0:12:46,98 --> 0:12:48,61
So were a lot of other people.


326
0:12:48,61 --> 0:12:52,19



327
0:12:52,19 --> 0:12:56,175
All right, I think we're done.


328
0:12:56,175 --> 0:12:59,67
I don't think there's anything
extra special in here.


329
0:12:59,67 --> 0:13:1,695
I don't know what else
is down here, dude.


330
0:13:1,695 --> 0:13:3,37
I don't have anything.


331
0:13:3,37 --> 0:13:5,51
Look at me, I can't
even go out.


332
0:13:5,51 --> 0:13:8,57
I got you guys fucking
keeping me in.


333
0:13:8,57 --> 0:13:10,7
-We're going to go
get ice cream.


334
0:13:10,7 --> 0:13:11,34
GRIME: We're good?


335
0:13:11,34 --> 0:13:12,54
-Yeah, we're good in here.


336
0:13:12,54 --> 0:13:12,84
GRIME: You done?


337
0:13:12,84 --> 0:13:13,44
-No, we're not done.


338
0:13:13,44 --> 0:13:14,4
GRIME: Make you happy?


339
0:13:14,4 --> 0:13:14,64
-We are not done.


340
0:13:14,64 --> 0:13:15,84
GRIME: That make you happy?


341
0:13:15,84 --> 0:13:17,34
-I'm almost happy.


342
0:13:17,34 --> 0:13:18,59
A little bit.


343
0:13:18,59 --> 0:15:18,59
