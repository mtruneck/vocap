###14 SUROOSH ALVI: Since it was the Muslim holy month of Muharram,
###17 which is especially significant for the Shia, we
###20 decided to head to Sadr City.
###22 It's Friday.
###23 We're going to check out the big prayer.
###25 Apparently, it's a sight to be seen.
###27 Everybody prays on the streets for a huge distance from the
###30 mosque all the way out.
###33 Now, just a few years back, the idea of Westerners paying
###36 a little visit to Sadr City would have been unthinkable as
###39 it was the heart of the insurgency against the
###41 American occupation--
###43 the home of firebrand cleric Muqtada Al-Sadr
###46 and his Mahdi Army.
###48 Even now, it took a lot of work and a Mahdi Army escort
###51 to get us in.
###52 It's supposedly forbidden to fight during
###54 the month of Muharram.
###56 But with heightened Sunni-Shia tensions, the Iraqi army
###59 thought it was a good idea to have the bomb squad present
###62 just in case.

###79 SUROOSH ALVI: More than 13,000 people turned out to pray and
###81 to listen to a cleric who influences the attitudes of an
###84 even greater number of Iraq's Shia majority.

###120 SUROOSH ALVI: How do you feel about the westernization of
###123 Iraqi youth since the American occupation and
###126 since they've left?
###127 METHAL AL-HASNAWI: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###128 
###148 SUROOSH ALVI: The cleric made it clear that getting the US
###150 out of Iraq wasn't enough.
###152 He wants to eliminate American influence of any kind.
###155 We headed back to the neighborhood of Karrada to
###158 meet up with Waleed and get a tour of his old haunts.
###161 Hey, welcome to Iraq, buddy.
###162 Welcome home.
###164 Waleed wanted to check out Acrassicauda's old practice
###167 space, that is, if we could find it.
###170 There's a strange feeling walking around, considering
###173 the last time I was here I wasn't even allowed to get out
###176 of our armored car.
###177 WALEED: It's been a very, very long time since I've last
###180 walked this street.
###182 This is filled with memories of starving nights with the
###186 band hitting the shit out of the instruments, rocking out,
###190 and trying to figure out-- how the fuck are we
###193 going to go back home?
###193 SUROOSH ALVI: This is basically 10 years ago.
###195 WALEED: Yeah.
###196 
###198 This is it.
###199 SUROOSH ALVI: It's been rebuilt.
###200 WALEED: Yep, completely changed now.
###205 SUROOSH ALVI: It's like art galleries.
###209 If we hadn't been sure this was the spot, we would have
###211 walked right by it.
###212 The practice space got completely bombed
###215 out during the war.
###216 And today it's unrecognizable, which I guess is a good thing.
###221 WALEED: The area changed so much that it
###224 looks completely different.
###226 SUROOSH ALVI: Waleed wanted to see if his childhood home was
###228 still standing.
###229 But on our way there, we were re-introduced to one of the
###233 most notorious features of Baghdad--
###235 checkpoints.
###237 Car bombs are such an issue in Baghdad that hundreds of the
###241 checkpoints that were originally established by the
###243 American military are still in place today.
###246 WALEED: Look at this fucking shit, man.
###248 Have you noticed, every street has a checkpoint, every area
###251 has a checkpoint of entrance and exit.
###253 It's so sad.
###255 Literally, you have to plan your day to the T.
###258 SUROOSH ALVI: Because it slows everything down.
###260 Not only does it make getting around a nightmare, but doing
###263 anything other than staring straight ahead and hoping you
###266 get through can throw your entire day into a tailspin.
###269 Put it down.
###271 What are they saying?
###272 You can't film?
###273 WALEED: They're like, don't film near a police patrol.
###277 SUROOSH ALVI: After inspecting our press credentials and
###279 undergoing a thorough search, we were allowed to slowly make
###281 our way to Waleed's old house.
###284 WALEED: Everything is blockaded.
###287 You can't really access the house or the neighborhood.
###289 So we had to turn around, go all the way back, and then
###292 come through here.
###293 SUROOSH ALVI: Did it get bombed, this neighborhood?
###295 WALEED: Yeah, and it looks pretty fucking different.
###297 
###310 That's pretty fucking insane.
###312 This used to be my old library.
###313 
###320 It's like a fucking junkyard, man.
###324 SUROOSH ALVI: Right before Waleed left the country, he
###326 received a series of death threats.
###328 His work as a fixer for foreign journalists and as a
###331 member of a heavy metal band made him a target.
###334 WALEED: I'll show you right here.
###335 So at 6:00 in the morning, I would leave.
###338 And there was a note right here, an envelope, right here.
###343 And when I opened it, it was a very, very frank letter of--
###348 we shall cleanse the soil of our country from the stench of
###353 people like you.
###354 So I went kind of crazy, and I went into the street, and I
###357 started screaming and yelling, like if you're a man just come
###359 up right now.
###360 I came back after two weeks, and I left at a different time
###364 this time in the morning.
###366 And there was another one of those.
###369 SUROOSH ALVI: Waiting for you when you walked in.
###369 WALEED: Waiting for me.
###370 So what I realized is that the person who had dropped it had
###374 to have been watching over from somewhere around here,
###379 where he can see me leaving the apartment and going down.
###382 And that's when I knew that the danger was very, very
###385 imminent on my family because of me.
###388 So yeah, three days after that, I was in Jordan.
###392 SUROOSH ALVI: But the death threats against anyone who's
###394 not on the straight and narrow continue to this day.
###397 And as we would learn, these threats are not empty.
