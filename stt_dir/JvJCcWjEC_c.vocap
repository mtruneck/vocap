###0 Sometimes a person asks a question
###4 in a field that they know very little about.
###8 If a person's not familiar with electronics at all
###14 says "What if the machine breaks down?"
###18 An electronics person doesn't know what he's talking about.
###21 Is it the transistors, the capacitors, the circuit, the welding?
###25 If you don't talk about specifics, you're not communicating.
###30 When a person says to me "You can't predict the behavior of people"
###35 they're telling me that they don't know
###37 how to predict the behavior of people.
###40 It's a subject that I can't do anything with unless they say
###44 "What do you do about people that insist that they're right?"
###48 That's a specific question.
###51 A specific question is "How do you arrive at your decision
###55 and why is your decision any better than any other decision?"
###60 The person that asks that question
###62 may or may not understand the answer.
###66 The assumption that people understand the answer that you give them
###70 is an assumption and projection.
###73 In order to check it out
###76 if you have the time and you have a few people
###79 you can say "What do you think I mean by that?"
###82 and if they come off with something 'off'
###84 you know that they didn't get your intention.
###90 People that work on automobiles, engineers
###94 not mechanics (mechanics are a little different than engineers).
###100 Engineers understand the efficiency ratio of the parts
###105 how many miles you get per gallon of fuel
###110 and the technician understands the function
###113 of all the parts of the car.
###115 If you say "Automobiles are unsafe! " with conviction
###120 that doesn't tell you how to make them safer.
###123 It doesn't tell you anything, unless you say
###127 "If you make the brake drums an inch larger
###129 the car will stop sooner ," something you can use.
###134 A non-answerable question is
###137 "How are you going to control the population? You can't control
###140 the population. They go right on multiplying!"
###143 The question is "How do you control the population?"
###147 and not "You can't control the population. They go right on multiplying!"
###151 That does not give you alternatives.
###153 When a person says "You can't make airplanes absolutely safe"
###159 what the hell does that tell you? Nothing
###162 except for that person's limited ability to participate.
###167 If a man would say "If you made airplanes safer..."
###172 that doesn't tell you anything you can use either
###175 so you have to discredit that. If a person says
###178 "Governments have been corrupt ever since history began!"
###182 That doesn't tell you how to make them 'uncorrupt.'
###185 They have nothing to offer, unless you show
###189 a method of making a government work
###192 unless you say "I would like to know
###195 what your view is on this."
###199 If a person comes up to me and says
###200 "What is your view on automobile safety?"
###205 I'd say "Do you know anything about automobiles:
###208 the mechanisms, the valves, what they're for?" "No?"
###212 Then you can't talk about the anatomy of the automobile.
###216 Do you understand that?
###218 If you know nothing about the human body, you can't talk about anatomy.
###223 "People get sick and we don't always know why."
###226 That's something you can't do anything with
###230 If you say "You can't predict human beings.
###232 They all come from different environments
###234 and they have many different reactions.
###236 You can't make them all react the same way."
###239 That doesn't tell you anything
###241 except the person's limitations that they're talking about.
###246 If you're not equipped to understand the answer, you can't ask questions.
###251 If a guy says "You know, electronics can fail too!"
###254 That's participation, but offering nothing.
###259 Do you understand that?
###263 Sometimes I will not engage a person
###266 if I feel they're not talking about the subject.
###269 If they say "You can't predict human behavior.
###273 Different people may have different views. " "Well, that's true.
###276 Give me the different views."
###279 "Let's make our building ten stories high
###281 instead of four. " "Why do you want to do that?"
###284 Just talk about the subject!
###288 Remember this. This is the thing you have to remember.
###292 People will talk about all kinds of things
###295 but not when their car breaks down.
###298 They take it to an auto mechanic.
###301 When the air-conditioning breaks down
###303 they take it to an air-conditioning mechanic.
###307 You can go to the baker
###309 and he can say "Well, I don't know.
###312 Check the input and output ," but he doesn't know.
###317 Everybody likes to feel competent.
###320 Everybody likes to feel they want to participate.
###324 The question is, can they?
###326 The only way you can participate in anything
###329 is to offer a tangible, referential description.
###333 If you believe that all things are affected by other things
###338 that means that human behavior is predictable
###341 if you believe that conditioning shapes behavior.
###346 If you think it's 'inborn,' you can't think about it.
###350 You can't predict.
###353 You say "Who the hell knows what the inborn emotions are going to be!"
###357 If you can't predict it, you can't deal with it.
###360 If you believe that people scratch their heads because it itches
###363 or they think it itches, that's all right
###367 as long as you know why.
###369 Every act, like if a person adjusts their glasses
###371 it means their ear pressure is bad or the vision is not good
###375 or the glasses are too low
###377 and they move it up, you have to ask why they move the glasses.
###381 You can take guesses
###383 but that's not why they move their eyeglasses.
###387 If you believe that human behavior is based upon
###391 what Skinner is known for, reinforcement
###394 he says people will do anything
###398 if you reinforce them in their terms.
###403 A person asks "Do you allow for individuality in that society?"
###407 Individuality to me means, differences in values
###413 by different aspects of the culture.
###416 We can't afford all kinds of individuals.
###419 When a guy wants to wear a suit with 3 creases in it
###424 well, that's individual. But it's 'unsane' individuality.
###430 'Unsane' individuality is when people say
###434 "I've got a new dance, it's this.
###437 You don't need to get up! " Well, that's an individual
###441 but that dance doesn't do anything for people.
###445 Convincing them of that, do they want to know?
###448 "What do you think of this type of dancing?"
###451 I would say, it's no different, no better, no worse
###455 than existing dancing, but I can't deal with that kind of problem.
###460 If I say dancing is a 'nothing' thing
###463 I mean, what does it contribute?
###466 It contributes to the well-being of people. They feel good, dancing.
###469 Is that important? What if they want to see a bullfight?
###473 They feel good watching a bullfight.
###476 "Feel good" is not the ultimate answer
###479 it's the collective utility of the answer
###482 that I would go by.
###484 What will benefit people most? To know about
###488 basic things, how they work, how a flashlight works
###491 how automobiles are interconnected, how we relate to the environment.
###496 If you say man is part of nature
###500 say without food, man cannot survive.
###503 That's what I mean by that when I say he's part of nature.
###507 If the oxygen is not in the air, he will die.
###510 He thinks he's part of nature because he doesn't know
###514 that we depend on nitrogen.
###516 Lightning fixes the nitrogen in the soil.
###519 It makes it available to plants.
###524 Is that the purpose of lightning? No.
###526 Lightning occurs and nitrogen becomes modified.
###531 But lightning is not there to modify the nitrogen.
###535 You can tell by ... electricity would flow only in the ground
###541 and modify the nitrogen only. It wouldn't go through the atmosphere
###545 and hit a tree and a little girl on a bicycle.
###550 Then it means it wasn't designed for a purpose.
###554 If you have ice weather, you say
###557 "The purpose of winter is to give us a change in season. We need change."
###562 People living in the tropics have never heard of winter time
###565 those who've been brought up there
###567 and they wouldn't know what you're talking about.
###570 If they say "What is the winter for?"
###573 you'd reply "Well... it's to give us a change in season."
###577 The average person not being
###579 a meteorologist (a student of weather)
###583 doesn't know what questions to ask
###586 but there are lots of kids who would love to participate.
###589 So they'll say "What if a person doesn't want to live in that city?"
###593 They're looking for participation.
###597 If you say "The water supply is not even in all the houses.
###602 Can you make it so that all people get water when they want it?"
###606 that's what they want to know, but you can't say
###608 "What if I don't want to live in that city?"
###610 That's just bringing up an argument
###614 do you see, for the recognition of participation.
###619 Real participation is "How would you
###624 acclimate people to this design
###627 if they were brought up to believe in individual housing?"
###631 You can't do that unless you tell them
###634 where people get their values from.
###636 If you live in an igloo or a thatched hut
###640 or a wigwam, those become normal to you.
###646 Your assumption that you've answered a person's question
###649 is an assumption unless you ask them "What do you think I mean?"
###654 and they come up with something entirely different, you say
###657 "Apparently I was unable to get that across"
###660 or they don't have the background
###663 to understand what went wrong with the electronics.
###667 If you tell them "The kidney
###670 and the spleen are not working properly"
###673 and they say "Oh" but they don't know anything.
###678 In order to know things, you have to get the handbook of the spleen
###682 and anatomy of different organs:
###685 how they work, what they do.
###687 Do the organs work or are they controlled by emotions?
###691 If you study emotions and the effect on organs
###695 which is another subject all together:
###697 the psychology of illness.
###700 It isn't always the failure of the kidney.
###704 It could be the failure of love of life in you.
###707 If your whole family is killed in an automobile accident
###710 you may not want to live anymore.
###712 They call that the will to die
###715 and there are some people that can will death.
###718 I know it seems strange but they go to bed at night
###722 and they don't feel alive, and they don't sleep well.
###725 They miss the other people and their life has been cut
###730 what they call their life.
###732 If people live in a world where everybody is friendly
###736 everybody is concerned about your well-being
###739 when your closest friend dies, you're not left alone.
###743 "How am I going to pay the rent? How am I going to eat?"
###747 People live alone today
###749 and I would say that if everybody tried to work
###753 to enhance the lives of everybody else, you wouldn't be desolate
###758 when somebody died in your family that was important to you.
###761 There is no communication with people
###764 that are not schooled in that discipline.
###767 What you have to do is teach them that discipline first
###771 that their behavior is not their own; it's shaped by culture.
###775 If you can convince them, do that first
###778 and then go off in a different direction, you're better off.
###781 If you show them... If they believe that every person's an individual
###786 and individuality is within the person
###789 if you can't disprove that, get out of the conversation
###793 because you can't take it anywhere.
###796 If you get mad at somebody
###797 it means you really don't understand this subject.
###802 If a guy says "You wanna fight?"
###806 he believes that if he can beat you in a fight, he's right.
###812 He may be better at fighting than you are, but it doesn't make him right.
###816 Normal, ordinary people believe
###819 that the guy who's better at fighting is right.
###823 "Right is might! " You've heard that shit.
###827 If you're right, you can get the shit kicked out of you.
###831 Do you understand questions and answers? There are no answers.
###836 An answer is... Can you answer this question:
###839 What makes war, like there's an answer? This is the answer:
###843 It's a whole study of kingdoms and habits of thought
###848 and this nation is different than the other nation
###850 and believes their way is the right way
###853 so they try to kill the other nation.
###856 Are they bad? No. Are they murderers? No.
###859 They're victims of a different culture.
###863 If you can't get to people
###866 instead of saying they're dumb, either you don't have the time
###869 to build a referential language
###872 or they don't have the background to understand you.
###875 That's possible.
###877 I wanted you to get this bit so you don't waste your time.
###881 I don't talk to people that raise questions like:
###886 "You can't predict human behavior. " I can't do anything with that.
