SHANE SMITH: So we're in St.
Petersburg with Yvgeni Yufit


4
0:0:11,73 --> 0:0:15,49
at the old Soviet documentary
filmmaking house in the


5
0:0:15,49 --> 0:0:18,84
basement surrounded by
40 years of filth.


6
0:0:18,84 --> 0:0:21,302
And we were there
to make a film.


7
0:0:21,302 --> 0:0:25,73



8
0:0:25,73 --> 0:0:26,195
YVGENI YUFIT: Shane.


9
0:0:26,195 --> 0:0:29,32
SHANE SMITH: Yeah?


10
0:0:29,32 --> 0:0:31,476
SHANE SMITH: It's really dark.


11

15
0:0:46,486 --> 0:1:5,34



16
0:1:5,34 --> 0:1:8,3
SHANE SMITH: I don't think
I want to be an actor,


17
0:1:8,3 --> 0:1:10,97
especially not in necro-realism
films that make


18
0:1:10,97 --> 0:1:12,87
me shove shit in my mouth.


19
0:1:12,87 --> 0:1:14,2
I feel like I'm going to puke.


20
0:1:14,2 --> 0:1:16,5
And now they're going to make
me take my pants off and run


21
0:1:16,5 --> 0:1:18,21
down the fucking thing.


22
0:1:18,21 --> 0:1:20,174
Maybe the most fucking
humiliating thing I've--


23
0:1:20,174 --> 0:1:21,596
[LAUGHS]

29
0:2:3,77 --> 0:2:5,2
SHANE SMITH: It's a wrap?


30
0:2:5,2 --> 0:2:9,251



31
0:2:9,251 --> 0:2:10,65
SHANE SMITH: I see ball sacks.


32
0:2:10,65 --> 0:2:16,4



33
0:2:16,4 --> 0:2:19,4
What's amazing about St.
Petersburg is you come here,


34
0:2:19,4 --> 0:2:22,95
and they're filming in 35 with
old Soviet cameras they have


35
0:2:22,95 --> 0:2:25,25
hand generators, they are saying
let's be surrealist


36
0:2:25,25 --> 0:2:26,75
like the 1920s.


37
0:2:26,75 --> 0:2:29,51
I was acting with a guy there
who's been 30 years in Soviet


38
0:2:29,51 --> 0:2:33,6
cinema who was eating dirt,
before he went out to pull his


39
0:2:33,6 --> 0:2:38,62
pants down, from a ground that
hasn't been swept since 1936.


40
0:2:38,62 --> 0:2:40,61
And then you walk into this
room, which is a forgotten


41
0:2:40,61 --> 0:2:43,32
room, and you look around and
go, this is maybe the most


42
0:2:43,32 --> 0:2:44,945
beautiful sound stage
of all time.


43
0:2:44,945 --> 0:2:46,62
And it's totally forgotten.


44
0:2:46,62 --> 0:2:49,945
It's fucking last bastion
of real filmmaking.


45
0:2:49,945 --> 0:2:51,358
And I'm drunk.


46
0:2:51,358 --> 0:3:7,18
[MUSIC PLAYING]


47
0:3:7,18 --> 0:3:8,28
SHANE SMITH: After shooting
that film, I


48
0:3:8,28 --> 0:3:10,3
passed out dead drunk.


49
0:3:10,3 --> 0:3:13,56
And the minute I woke up, I
got in a car, went to the


50
0:3:13,56 --> 0:3:16,305
airport, and said put me on any
plane, the first plane out


51
0:3:16,305 --> 0:3:20,3
of here, because I got sick of
drinking 24 hours a day.


52
0:3:20,3 --> 0:3:23,47
I was sick of people asking me
for papers every two blocks--


53
0:3:23,47 --> 0:3:25,25
the military, the police.


54
0:3:25,25 --> 0:3:27,55
I got sick of the cold, the
grey, the oppression.


55
0:3:27,55 --> 0:3:31,48
But when I got the film from
Yvgeni and watched it, I got a


56
0:3:31,48 --> 0:3:34,11
little glimpse into Russia and
what parallel cinema is.


57
0:3:34,11 --> 0:3:39,8



58
0:3:39,8 --> 0:3:41,3
Russia is oppressive.


59
0:3:41,3 --> 0:3:42,61
It's hard, and it's
hard drinking.


60
0:3:42,61 --> 0:3:45,43
But out of this oppression
can come great art.


61
0:3:45,43 --> 0:3:49,62
And I felt very blessed because
I don't think this


62
0:3:49,62 --> 0:3:51,7
will be able to happen
much longer.


63
0:3:51,7 --> 0:3:54,49
When I was there, the Cold
War rhetoric was


64
0:3:54,49 --> 0:3:55,55
really heating up.


65
0:3:55,55 --> 0:3:56,62
Putin is anti-America.


66
0:3:56,62 --> 0:3:58,22
Russia is anti-America.


67
0:3:58,22 --> 0:4:2,31
It's getting to be like the
Cold War never ended.


68
0:4:2,31 --> 0:4:5,8



69
0:4:5,8 --> 0:4:8,89
SHANE SMITH: Would you say
it's the same political


70
0:4:8,89 --> 0:4:11,24
climate as before with
the Soviet Union?


71
0:4:11,24 --> 0:4:12,68
PAVEL LIABAZOV: Is it for TV?


72
0:4:12,68 --> 0:4:14,144
SHANE SMITH: Yeah.


73
0:4:14,144 --> 0:4:17,72
PAVEL LIABAZOV: (DISBELIEVING)
I, I don't know [LAUGHS].
