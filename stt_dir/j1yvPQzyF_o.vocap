###1 <i>As a doctor</i> <i>you need to be prepared for anything:</i>
###4 <i>Heart attacks</i> <i>drug overdoses gunshot wounds,</i>
###7 <i>But one thing you can't prepare for</i>
###9 <i>is what happens</i> <i>after you break up with a co-worker,</i>
###13 - Watch where you're walking! - You watch where you're walking.
###16 <i>Get the last word in,</i>
###18 - You watch where you're walking! - You watch where you're walking!
###23 <i>Try as hard as you can to avoid them</i> <i>you're bound to run into 'em one day,</i>
###31 <i>And the next day,</i>
###36 <i>And the next day,</i>
###39 - You don't even play sports. - This helps me to relieve stress!
###47 Feel better?
###51 l do now.
###55 - Girl problems? - How'd you know?
###57 You look like you got problems. You're a girl.
###60 Hence, girl problems. Watch your nails.
###63 <i>The only positive is that</i> <i>a hospital's like one big family,</i>
###66 <i>So if one relationship ends</i> <i>there are others around you can rely on,</i>
###70 - Dr Cox, l was wondering... - l'd say you're about a B-cup.
###76 At least they're real.
###78 <i>Yep it's a good place to heal,</i>
###97 Look, Mom, l gotta go.
###102 He did?
###106 Yeah. All right. l love you too. Bye.
###111 My high school teacher, Mr Peters, died.
###116 - Was a great guy. - You OK?
###119 <i>Even though I see death</i> <i>all the time now</i>
###121 <i>I still react the same way</i> <i>as when I was a kid,</i>
###124 Doin' a lot better than Mr Peters.
###126 - Dude. - What's up, newbie?
###128 My favourite high school teacher just died.
###131 The correct answer is, ''Nothing, sir''.
###134 My God. Would you look at this hellhole?
###139 lf l see more broken-down equipment,
###141 one more gomer shuffled back and forth between some godforsaken home,
###146 one more patient denied treatment
###148 because they got the wrong insurance, l...
###152 There are times when l concentrate as hard as l can
###155 to see if l can catch on fire like the Human Torch.
###159 And mark my words, newbie, if l ever pull it off,
###161 l will be back here to destroy this place.
###164 l used to like the Silver Surfer.
###166 - Hang ten! Hang... - Get in here.
###169 <i>After a while</i> <i>you get used to Dr Cox's rants,</i>
###171 And the lab tech is nowhere to be found,
###174 so l can't get that tox screen l was looking for.
###177 What do you say we write him a friendly note?
###180 ''Dear
###182 incompetent
###183 dumb-ass.''
###187 <i>The truth is Dr Cox isn't really</i> <i>angry he's just amusing himself,</i>
###193 <i>Maybe he's a little angry,</i>
###198 We didn't need those.
###200 So, all done?
###210 He broke his pencil.
###216 Turk, you'll be happy you picked me to co-write this study.
###219 Hell, yeah. l thought we'd start off by having a couple of beers.
###223 l got all the info on peripheral vascular disease,
###226 highlighted passages and coded them
###229 to correspond with the outline in your packet.
###231 But l don't have a packet.
###233 Look at that. Turk's packet.
###236 - So you did this last night? - Yeah.
###238 - Why? What'd you do? - Carla had to work, so l scarfed down
###242 a bunch of fast food and got back home at around seven.
###245 Then l went to the bathroom at eight. l got outta there at 1 1 .1 5.
###250 lt was a good night!
###253 l'm a nervous poo-er.
###255 You are not gonna believe what Dr Cox...
###259 - lt's you. - Yeah. lt's me.
###262 <i>Could Turk have picked anyone</i> <i>worse to be doing this project with?</i>
###267 lf this is a peripheral vascular disease study,
###270 then l'd exclude all claudication patients not on pentoxifylline.
###275 What're you lookin' at?
###278 l'm gonna go to bed.
###282 Elliot, are you gonna go with him?
###286 Too early for jokes? That's good to know.
###289 lt's good to know.
###294 lnteresting. lt isn't often l'm paged by a nurse.
###297 The last time was when...
###300 What was her name? She hasn't worked here since.
###303 Never mind. What can l do for you and your coma patient?
###306 l came across Mr Rice's advance directive,
###308 and he has a few requests he would like us to honour.
###311 Let's see. Blinds open? That's done.
###314 lncense burning?
###318 Close enough. Glad you called.
###321 Dr Kelso, he also wants to hear Poison's <i>Talk Dirty to Me</i> once a day.
###326 He wants to hear whose what?
###329 Poison. lt's a heavy metal band.
###331 Like Mötley Crüe and Winger.
###334 My son was a bit of a headbanger.
###336 - l'll get a tape deck in here... - Nurse Espinosa, that's not necessary.
###340 - lt's just one song. - lt starts out as just one song.
###343 But then half of the hospital staff
###346 is piercing their genitalia and fornicating in the back of vans.
###351 Unless a family member enforces the directive,
###354 we don't have to do anything.
###356 Now, will you do me a favour
###358 and just forget about it, sweetheart?
###363 Of course.
###364 Can you help me locate one of his family members?
###367 l could try to locate one through some legal channels, but l'm really swamped.
###372 l love your worry lines. They're adorable.
###375 They're like sexy little forehead smiles.
###378 Careful, l've been hurt before.
###380 You won't believe what happened yesterday.
###383 Dr Cox went ballistic and destroyed an entire lab room.
###387 Broken computers, chairs through windows, shattered beakers.
###392 Beakers. How is this is not good gossip?
###395 JD, he does this every year. And whatever you do,
###398 don't get caught in his wake, because he'll take you down.
###401 Downtown.
###404 All the way?
###410 lt's OK, boy. Who is it?
###416 Little piggy, open up this door or l will start huffing and puffing.
###421 But, Dr Cox, l... OK!
###429 Dear Lord, please tell me that's not a onesie.
###432 l'd invite you in...
###434 - l've no interest in coming in. - <i>Thank God,</i>
###436 We're goin' out.
###439 We can finish the synopsis for chapter four,
###442 and process the Stegemann data if we pull an all-nighter.
###445 - This isn't due for another month. - But if we finish one week early,
###449 we can play with fonts and margins.
###452 Look...
###454 Tonight's date night with Carla, and l got on special underwear.
###458 Go.
###460 Would you mind if l keep working?
###463 Yeah, that works for me.
###467 l'm wearing special underwear too. They're invisible.
###472 Todd, l'm just kinda busy here.
###474 No time for the Todd.
###476 All the project geeks are busy working tonight.
###479 Excuse me?
###481 All the surgical interns picked a project geek from Medical
###484 - to write our reports for us. - l'm not a geek.
###487 What's that on your finger?
###490 lt's a rubber thingy to help me turn the pages...
###493 ...quicker.
###496 She said ''rubber thingy''.
###500 Excuse me, nurse. l'm ready for my sponge bath.
###503 l'm sorry, l can't.
###505 l gotta pick up a CD for this coma patient.
###508 - But l'm wearing silk boxers. - Turk...
###511 The ones with the dogs holding big money bags.
###513 Sweetie, l love your money pants.
###515 lt's just that l feel somebody needs to take care of this guy.
###519 How is it that you can blow me off and it makes you sexier?
###522 - Cos you're whipped. - l thought so.
###525 Thank you.
###531 Minty.
###533 So we're here. What do you wanna talk about?
###536 lf you don't toss that shot back, l'm gonna throw you
###539 up on the bar and make you sing the theme song from <i>Endless Love,</i>
###547 - Yucky. - Yucky?
###550 l'm drinking with a mouseketeer.
###553 Two more.
###555 lf you're not gonna talk to me, what's the point of sitting alone in a bar?
###559 You know, that's a good point. lt is.
###563 Excuse me, ladies. Do you know anybody who might like a couple of free drinks?
###572 Hello, ladies.
###577 Yes, it's a onesie.
###581 Great news. l'm back for the night.
###583 You know what?
###585 The hell with you, Chris Turk.
###589 What the hell got into her?
###591 Wassup!
###606 Could you turn that off, please?
###608 What?
###611 l thought l told you not to play that in the house... Hospital.
###615 l'm just trying to do right by my patient.
###618 As of this moment, he is no longer your patient.
###621 - Dr Kelso, you... - Young lady,
###623 when l asked you to leave it alone, l wasn't really asking you.
###627 lt's like when l ask the paperboy to avoid hitting my rosebushes.
###630 l'm saying you damn well better do it
###633 or l'm going to forget to put the chain on Baxter.
###636 Now get on out of here and take that boom blaster with you!
###642 My relationship with Jeremy was emotionally over before he ended it.
###646 Then l graduated from college and met Ethan.
###649 You don't say?
###652 We had two good years and two bad years, but not all at once.
###655 Of course.
###659 Dr Cox, don't get me wrong.
###662 Love getting drunk in my jammies just as much as the next guy,
###666 but it's late, so...
###668 Thanks for coming out, newbie.
###671 Hope this whole thing wasn't too yucky for you.
###674 You seem fine, so l'm...
###676 l am not fine.
###679 Why do you think we're out here at this bar at two in the morning?
###684 Just so we can go in the urinal and piss on the ice?
###686 l love to melt the middle.
###689 We're out here because if l go home and go to sleep,
###691 the only thing l'll be able to think about is l gotta go back to that place.
###696 And you wanna know something?
###699 l got nothing.
###701 Honest to God, l got nothing. l'm cooked.
###713 You owe me $53.
###718 l think l left my wallet in my other onesie.
###727 The bartender let you skip out on the tab?
###729 He said l could pay him back by giving him a physical,
###732 which is scary because l never said l was a doctor.
###735 l warned you about getting caught up in Dr Cox's wake.
###738 - Does he listen? - You'd think so with those ears.
###740 Uncalled for.
###743 lt's different. He showed up at my place.
###745 He showed up at my house.
###746 - Showed up at my mama's. - Ruined my wedding.
###750 l know you think he's gonna shake this off,
###753 but l connected with the guy, and there is no way
###756 he'll walk in with a big smile.
###758 What do you say, sports fans? lt's a great day!
###768 Elliot, Todd has something to say to you.
###771 Todd?
###773 Turk never told me you were his project geek.
###776 - And? - You look really hot eating that egg.
###781 l'm sorry.
###784 - OK? Are we? - No.
###789 Look at me and tell me l'm not a geek.
###792 - You still got that rubber thingy on. - Eggs can be extremely slippery.
###800 You scared the hell outta me.
###802 l'm sorry. That always happens.
###804 No one ever expects me to be anywhere.
###807 Aw, Ted.
###810 She knows your name.
###812 So, l found your coma patient's relative you were looking for.
###817 Thank you! Thank you so much.
###820 Don't let go.
###822 - What? - Nothing.
###824 l'll acknowledge there have been occasions during my tenure...
###828 What do you think you're doing?
###830 Apologising to Franklyn for breaking his favourite microscope.
###834 You can't cry on my shoulder then pretend nothing happened.
###838 All right. First of all, Franklyn, there was no crying.
###841 Say it.
###843 - No crying. - Good boy.
###845 And you should give some thought
###847 to purchasing some non-bunching panties.
###850 They give you the extra support
###852 while protecting against those lines underneath your scrubs.
###855 - l get it. l'm a girl. - Franklyn, you heard it. Say it.
###858 - He's a girl. - Good boy.
###860 You can't play with people's emotions cos you feel like it.
###863 OK, newbie, l'm now going to give you an opportunity
###866 to get out of here before l grab you by your ankles
###869 and redecorate Franklyn's lab.
###872 Please go.
###876 We're back. The clique is back together!
###878 That is what l'm talkin' about. Shall we?
###882 Let's do this.
###893 Let's get back to work.
###895 But it's gonna be different this time.
###898 lf we take a systematic approach, we'll maximise our efficiency.
###902 l rented <i>Red Dawn,</i>
###904 Wolverines!
###905 Dr Kelso, this is Matthew Rice.
###908 He's the proxy for his uncle's living will.
###911 What a happy coincidence,
###913 you showing up out of the clear blue sky.
###917 - Oh, God. - You're OK.
###919 So, exactly how much is my uncle leaving me? Can l ask that?
###922 This isn't about his assets.
###925 This is about executing his last living requests.
###928 So no money at all?
###930 Not a dime, kiddo.
###932 l can't tell you how glad we are
###935 to put all this tomfoolery to rest.
###937 Once and for all. Cup of coffee, sport?
###944 What happened? l blacked out.
###948 When you rolled out of bed this morning, did you say to yourself,
###951 ''Hey! l think today would be a terrific day to commit hari-kari''?
###956 That's what you're doing.
###958 You don't deal with problems the way emotionally healthy people do.
###961 Well, hold on a second there, Rainbow.
###964 This just off the news wire: You're not licensed to comment
###967 on how people deal with their emotions.
###970 - l beg to differ. - Well, at least l let mine go. You?
###973 lf you ever were able to actually
###976 release all the tensions that are bottled up inside of you,
###979 what would that look like? How would that go?
###986 How you like me now, bitch?
###989 Maybe l just don't have anything bottled up.
###994 What happened to that teacher you were prattling on about?
###997 - Passed away. - Croaksville. That's what l thought.
###1000 What did you do when you found out that he'd died?
###1003 - l made a joke. - l sure hope it was a good one.
###1007 Here's the inside scoop. Life's hard enough,
###1010 and there's no way you can survive in a dump like this
###1013 unless you find a way to get your emotions out.
###1016 Fact.
###1018 Well, l let my emotions out! l'll show you some of this!
###1025 Franklyn, l am so sorry.
###1029 Wanna wear my stethoscope?
###1032 The cool thing about this movie is that this could really happen.
###1036 The Russians invading, or C Thomas Howell being a tough guy?
###1039 Both.
###1043 Wolverines. Why is she always here?
###1047 We're working on my study.
###1050 Every time l come here l'm gonna see him.
###1053 Just get someone else to do this project with you.
###1055 Maybe the reason why l asked you to work with me
###1058 is because it would force you to see each other.
###1061 l don't want to get back together with him.
###1063 l'm not saying that. You made a terrible couple.
###1067 lt's just that... l like you. You know?
###1069 l think you're a cool person.
###1071 lt doesn't matter about me and JD.
###1074 - You and l can still hang out. - No.
###1077 lt can't be that way, and you know it.
###1080 Cos that's my best friend.
###1082 So, either you can try and fix it, or...
###1091 - This sucks. - Yeah.
###1094 <i>And baby we'll be</i>
###1097 <i>At the drive-in</i>
###1100 <i>In the old man's Ford</i>
###1104 <i>Behind the bushes</i>
###1109 <i>Till I'm screaming for more</i>
###1114 <i>Down the basement</i>
###1118 <i>Lock the cellar door</i>
###1122 <i>And baby</i>
###1126 <i>Talk dirty to</i>
###1130 <i>Me</i>
###1134 - l love you. - What?
###1137 <i>Know that we'll be</i>
###1140 <i>At the drive-in,,,</i>
###1146 What are you doing?
###1148 This is a recommendation letter from a high school teacher of mine.
###1152 He's actually
###1154 the reason l got into medicine.
###1157 And he died last week.
###1160 l'm so sorry, JD.
###1162 l really am.
###1169 Do you wanna be alone?
###1172 No.
###1173 You wanna cry a little?
###1177 No.
###1181 Wanna go throw stuff off the roof like Letterman used to do?
###1191 You see, it's the pudding that splatters the best,
###1194 because it's the pudding, and therefore l say let the pudding pop fall!
###1199 - Who is that? Arsenio? - No.
###1202 <i>Everyone has their own way of releasing</i>
###1205 <i>the stuff that gets</i> <i>bottled up inside them,</i>
###1207 <i>It just took a good friend</i> <i>to help me find mine,</i>
###1210 Dr Dorian, we're ready for the finale.
###1212 Thank you, Dr Reid.
###1214 OK, guys.
###1216 One, two, three.
###1227 <i>It felt really good,</i>
###1230 Player.
###1242 The horror. �
