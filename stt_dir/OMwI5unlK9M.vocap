###2 with cannibal warlords.
###3 
###7 MALE SPEAKER 1: I lift it up on the temple.
###8 I'm gonna eat it.
###10 [GUNFIRE]
###11 MALE SPEAKER 1: It's a Liberian general's heart.
###14 SHANE SMITH: I was afraid probably the whole time I was
###17 in Liberia.
###18 There's always this underlying hum of violence.
###20 And the poverty there is so crippling that you're kind of
###24 like, why wouldn't they steal our camera?
###25 Why wouldn't they steal our clothes?
###26 I mean, people are starving.
###28 And all they know is war.
###29 
###41 So is that why your nickname was General Butt Naked?
###43 
###46 SHANE SMITH: A lot of people would drink or do
###48 drugs before fighting?
###49 
###54 SHANE SMITH: So you killed a child?
###55 JOSHUA BLAHYI: Yes.
###56 SHANE SMITH: And then drank the blood.
###57 JOSHUA BLAHYI: Yeah.
###59 
###61 [GUNFIRE]
###66 [GUNFIRE]
###69 MALE SPEAKER 2: So what kind of war is this?
###70 Guerrilla?
###71 MALE SPEAKER 3: It's World War III.
###72 MALE SPEAKERS: It's World War III.
###72 [GUNFIRE]
###74 
###79 [HORN HONKING]
###83 SHANE SMITH: We here at Vice have been fascinated by
###85 Liberia for a long time.
###87 It's America's first and only foray into
###89 quasi-colonialism in Africa.
###92 It started as a back-to-Africa movement for freed slaves, and
###95 in fact, the Constitution was written in Washington, and
###98 Monrovia, the capital city of Liberia, is actually named
###102 after President Monroe.
###103 And it became a state in the 1840s.
###105 So the freed slaves go back to Africa and promptly enslave
###109 the native Africans based on the plantation method they had
###112 learned in the US, which lasts for about 140 years, until
###116 Samuel K. Doe, the first native, African-born Liberian,
###120 was elected.
###121 But this doesn't last very long.
###123 Why?
###124 
###126 Because an American-educated, and some would say
###128 American-backed, rebel leader named Charles Taylor and his
###132 buddy Prince Johnson came from America and overthrew him.
###135 
###159 NEWS REPORTER: Despite reports that the government wants
###161 talks with the rebels, the violence goes on.
###163 
###173 [GUNFIRE]
###174 NEWS REPORTER: Rebel forces stormed into the center of the
###176 capital today.
###177 They're now less than a mile from the executive mansion,
###180 where President Samuel Doe has barricaded himself with about
###183 500 soldiers.
###185 SHANE SMITH: In fact, Prince Johnson, who got to Doe before
###187 his buddy Charles, ended up torturing him, cutting him up,
###191 and is rumored to have eaten him while
###193 filming the whole thing.
###194 
###216 SHANE SMITH: So Charles Taylor finally gets elected with a
###219 campaign slogan that reads, He killed my ma, he killed my pa,
###223 but I'll still vote for him.
###224 And it works.
###225 He gets elected.
###228 But he's so corrupt that soon after, there's a bunch of
###231 warlords fighting for control over Liberia.
###234 The country falls into civil war, and things go from bad to
###237 severely fucked up.
###240 [GUNFIRE]
###241 
###247 [GUNFIRE]
###248 SHANE SMITH: But this is like a civil war on steroids.
###250 It's a post-apocalyptic Armageddon, with child
###253 soldiers smoking heroin, cross-dressing cannibals,
###256 systematic rape--
###258 it's total hell on Earth.
###260 [GUNFIRE]
###262 MALE SPEAKER 4: We love the music.
###263 This is our music.
###264 NEWS REPORTER: They call it the sound of death.
###265 MALE SPEAKER 4: Yeah, but it's the sound of music to us.
###268 SHANE SMITH: Liberia's been in the news a lot lately because
###270 Charles Taylor is on trial at The Hague for war crimes.
###272 But we wanted to know what happened to
###274 all the other warlords.
###275 So we contacted a Canadian journalist who lives in
###277 Liberia named Myles Estey, who's kind of a Kurtz-like
###280 character--
###281 tall, skinny, skeleton guy who's had malaria more times
###284 than he's had hot dinners--
###285 and he said he could get us access to all these
###288 ex-warlords.
###289 So we said, great.
###291 We got on a plane and we flew to Liberia.
###293 
###296 [MUSIC - THE ALMIGHTY DEFENDERS, "ALL MY LOVING"]
###297 
###316 [HORN HONKS]
###317 [HORN HONKS]
###322 SHANE SMITH: When you first get to Monrovia, the first
###324 thing you think is, it's really hot.
###327 It's really hot.
###327 It's really poor.
###329 And it's totally chaotic.
###332 In fact, when we went to pick up Myles, he had just gotten
###335 out of the hospital with malaria.
###337 He gets in the car and he says, are you ready to go?
###340 We're going to Baboon Town in the Red Light district to meet
###343 our first general, General Bin Laden.
###345 
###350 So as we drove to Baboon Town, we asked Myles, what's up with
###353 the name General Bin Laden?
###354 And he said, well, a lot of the generals took different
###356 names because they didn't want to be identified after the
###359 various wars.
###360 And these pseudonyms were meant to strike terror into
###363 the hearts of their enemies.
###364 So there's a General Rambo, because he's scary.
###366 There was a General Mosquito, because mosquitoes are
###368 terrifying because they bring malaria.
###370 The general that fought General Mosquito was named
###372 General Mosquito Spray.
###374 [HORN HONKS]
###375 SHANE SMITH: And of course, there's General Bin Laden.
###377 In fact, there's two General Bin Ladens.
###379 Our General Bin Laden, we found out en route, had just
###382 been put in jail.
###383 Now he didn't know why, but he suspected because the
###386 authorities found out that we were coming with
###388 cameras to shoot him.
###390 MYLES ESTEY: And they say they're not going to let him
###392 out, but we can interview him in the jail and we can
###394 interview the commanders.
###395 SHANE SMITH: Let's do that.
###396 Let's go there.
###397 MYLES ESTEY: Yeah.
###400 SHANE SMITH: So the minute we arrive in Baboon Town, our car
###402 was surrounded by a bunch of sketchy dudes.
###404 So when Myles came back and said we could interview Bin
###406 Laden in the police station, I was like, yeah.
###409 Let's get out of here and get in there really quick.
###411 [MONKEY SCREECHES]
###412 
###416 SHANE SMITH: So we get into the police
###417 station, and it's chaos.
###419 Some guards are saying, you can go see him.
###421 Other guards are saying, you can't go see him.
###423 And we just have to sit there and wait.
###425 I like being in the police station.
###429 It's nice.
###430 [MONKEY SCREECHES]
###432 SHANE SMITH: Monkey.
###433 
###436 Little monkey.
###438 He's got herpes, I think, or something.
###440 [MONKEY CHATTERING]
###442 SHANE SMITH: Hi.
###444 What's wrong with the monkey?
###446 Why is the monkey here?
###449 SHANE SMITH: Why is the monkey here?
###451 We're in a police station in the middle of the red light
###456 district to meet General Bin Laden, and I'm wondering why
###460 the monkey's here.
###460 [MONKEY CHATTERS]
###462 
###466 SHANE SMITH: And eventually after sitting there for a
###468 while, we realized, oh, we've got to grease some palms.
###471 So we gave them some money, and bang.
###473 We were back into the jail and we could talk to Bin Laden.
###478 Hey, Bin Laden.
###479 GENERAL BIN LADEN: Yeah.
###480 SHANE SMITH: How are you?
###480 MYLES ESTEY: This is my friend Shane.
###481 SHANE SMITH: Shane.
###481 GENERAL BIN LADEN: [INAUDIBLE].
###482 SHANE SMITH: Nice to meet you.
###483 We're going to try to get you out of here now, and then we
###486 can go back.
###488 
###491 SHANE SMITH: All right.
###491 We're going to do it right now.
###493 
###498 MYLES ESTEY: Yeah.
###498 I know what he did.
###498 Just--we're talking about to get him out.
###500 What do we have to do?
###502 MYLES ESTEY: To who?
###504 
###519 SHANE SMITH: OK, we'll stop.
###520 We'll stop.
###522 It's off.
###522 MYLES ESTEY: The video's off.
###523 He's carrying it, he's just holding it right now.
###524 
###530 SHANE SMITH: Look, we're good people.
###531 We're good--
###532 nobody.
###533 Nobody's recording.
###534 
###537 SHANE SMITH: Sure.
###537 I can give him cash.
###539 Can we-- can we pay him and pay you a fine
###541 and then take him?
###542 POLICEMAN: Fine.
###542 SHANE SMITH: OK, great.
###543 POLICEMAN: That's good.
###543 SHANE SMITH: OK.
###544 OK, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.
###548 OK, let's go, let's go.
###549 
###557 MALE SPEAKER 5: Hey, hey, you.
###558 SHANE SMITH: We went in there.
###559 And we're being followed by the police right now.
###562 SHANE SMITH: Yeah, we might have to change tapes or do
###564 something, because--
###566 what we do is we shoot cards, and if they come, we can give
###569 them the tape.
###569 There's nothing on the tape.
###572 SHANE SMITH: Yeah, we do right now.
###573 
###592 SHANE SMITH: Our trip is getting progressively heavier.
###596 SHANE SMITH: Yeah, that'd be good.
###599 OK.
###600 I'm kind of a little bit worried that the police are
###602 going to come get us right now.
###603 I gave them a fake name and fake number.
###605 
###611 SHANE SMITH: OK.
###611 Nice to meet you.
###613 SHANE SMITH: Nice to meet you.
###614 
###618 SHANE SMITH: Thank you.
###618 Thank you.
###619 SHANE SMITH: So after we got Bin Laden out of jail, he was
###621 very excited to get us up to his rooftop
###623 and tell us his story.
###624 And according to him, the ex-generals, who are now the
###627 community leaders, are the only ones doing anything to
###629 help the people.
###631 So maybe you could explain a little bit about-- so first of
###634 all, you became known as Bin Laden during the war.
###636 GENERAL BIN LADEN: During the war.
###637 SHANE SMITH: And then after the war, now you're sort of
###639 trying to help people by carpentry and by karate.
###642 GENERAL BIN LADEN: And karate.
###643 
###660 SHANE SMITH: Do get any money here?
###661 
###665 SHANE SMITH: Yeah, but the UN, or the government doesn't give
###668 you any money?
###669 
###680 SHANE SMITH: And is this-- is this area--
###681 this is Red Light, here?
###682 GENERAL BIN LADEN: It's Red Light [INAUDIBLE].
###683 This is Red Light.
###684 SHANE SMITH: And is it--
###686 is there a lot of crime in Red Light.
###687 GENERAL BIN LADEN: Yeah.
###688 It's [INAUDIBLE].
###689 This is Red Light.
###689 SHANE SMITH: Red Light.
###690 
###730 SHANE SMITH: So Myles comes over, stops the interview, and
###732 says, we have to get the fuck out of here now.
###735 And Bin Laden looks down, and he goes, yeah, yeah.
###737 Those aren't my guys.
###738 You guys should really go.
###739 
###742 So Bin Laden gave us an escort and a couple of his guys got
###744 us through the crowd to the car, and we got the fuck out.
###749 CAMERAMAN: Let's go.
###750 Let's go.
###750 Let's go.
###751 Let's go.
###751 Let's go.
###752 Let's go.
###754 Holy fucking shit.
###757 That was out of hand.
###758 We gotta get out of here.
###760 
###763 There was some heavy-duty vibes there.
###765 
###769 SHANE SMITH: So after meeting and being freaked out by
###772 General Bin Laden, we wanted to see what the UN and
###774 government were doing to rebuild Liberia.
###776 So we met a local journalist named Nagbe and we asked him,
###780 and he said, you want to see what the
###781 government and UN are doing?
###782 I'll take you to West Point.
###784 
###794 So West Point is the worst slum in Liberia, which makes
###797 it one of the worst slums in West Africa, which makes it
###799 one of the worst slums in the world.
###801 And when you first get there, the first thing you want to do
###803 is get the hell out.
###804 It's open sewers everywhere, shit, piss, garbage,
###808 everything mixed in.
###810 And the stench is overpowering.
###811 
###841 CAMERAMAN: Oh, dude.
###842 It really stinks here.
###844 
###855 SHANE SMITH: But I mean, one of the first basic rules is,
###858 don't shit where you eat.
###859 IMMANUEL NAGBE: That's it, but--
###860 SHANE SMITH: That's the number one rule.
###861 
###865 SHANE SMITH: But the government has to do something
###866 about that--
###867 
###875 SHANE SMITH: So even in one of the worst slums of Western
###877 Africa, you see the cultural impact that America has there.
###881 All the kids are wearing Biggie or Tupac t-shirts.
###883 And in fact, one kid came up to us and
###885 said, hey, I'm a rapper.
###886 Can I rap for you?
###887 And we said yes.
###888 And it wasn't about bling, and it wasn't about Cristal.
###892 
###924 [DOG BARKING]
###926 SHANE SMITH: And is there a lot of malaria in here?
###929 SHANE SMITH: Needless to say, in West Point, health
###931 conditions are foul.
###933 Diseases everywhere.
###934 Malaria, infections, and AIDS are rampant.
###937 
###949 SHANE SMITH: Yeah?
###951 SHANE SMITH: Cover-up for heroin.
###952 SHANE SMITH: Wow.
###953 IMMANUEL NAGBE: It's a big business.
###954 SHANE SMITH: We heard stories that during the war, the
###956 rebels would go out in boats with diamonds and trade the
###959 diamonds for weapons and cocaine, and it was a lot of
###963 Colombians and Mexicans.
###966 SHANE SMITH: We find it interesting, because cocaine
###968 and heroin are very expensive drugs.
###970 So we were surprised to find heroin here.
###972 Usually, in poorer countries, there's speed or meth or
###976 things you can make.
###978 SHANE SMITH: Why is that?
###979 
###981 [CHILD CRYING]
###985 
###1017 SHANE SMITH: Liberian dollars?
###1019 IMMANUEL NAGBE: Liberian dollars.
###1019 SHANE SMITH: So how much is that?
###1021 SHANE SMITH: So because of the poverty, a lot of women have
###1023 to become prostitutes.
###1024 IMMANUEL NAGBE: Yes.
###1025 
###1028 SHANE SMITH: Sex worker.
###1029 IMMANUEL NAGBE: We can go this way.
###1030 
###1063 IMMANUEL NAGBE: Condoms, here.
###1064 
###1079 SHANE SMITH: So on our first day in Liberia, we see child
###1081 junkies, shit and piss everywhere, malaria, AIDS,
###1085 rape, and now we started hearing about cannibalism.
###1090 The scaredest I was, was we actually shot in West Point,
###1093 which is the worst slum in West Africa.
###1095 And it's kind of these rabbit warren streets.
###1097 And we went to shoot in a brothel with these junkies,
###1100 and the junkies started asking for money.
###1101 Like, where's my money?
###1102 Where's my money?
###1103 And people started hearing "money" and just flooded into
###1105 the brothel.
###1106 Like money, money, money.
###1107 So we took off.
###1108 The problem is, you take off, you can't go anywhere, because
###1111 there's these little streets that, you know, there's no
###1113 rhyme or reason to them.
###1114 So we're all running around in the dark.
###1116 We finally get back to the car, against all odds.
###1119 We get in the car, and our driver's so freaked out about
###1121 the mob following us that he peels off and nearly kills
###1124 some people.
###1124 Which is terrifying, because if you kill people down in
###1127 West Point, they'll just take the car, rip
###1129 you limb from limb.
###1130 And so against all odds, we get out of there.
###1132 And I'm like shaking and nervous, whatever.
###1135 And as we go, we realize, oh, now it's time to meet General
###1138 Butt Naked.
###1139
