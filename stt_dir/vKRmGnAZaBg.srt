1
0:0:0,2 --> 0:0:5,32
totally give grandpa some credit senator
from kentucky he i gave a speech today


2
0:0:5,32 --> 0:0:9,32
howard university which is an
historically african-american university


3
0:0:9,32 --> 0:0:14,67
adhe apparently had some interesting
things to say regarding out republicans


4
0:0:14,67 --> 0:0:16,509
and civil


5
0:0:16,509 --> 0:0:20,509
the republican promises for policies
that create economic growth


6
0:0:20,509 --> 0:0:24,44
we believe lower taxes less regulation
balanced budgets


7
0:0:24,44 --> 0:0:27,759
assault on social security a solvent
medicare


8
0:0:27,759 --> 0:0:32,11
will all stimulate growth using taxes to
punish the rich


9
0:0:32,11 --> 0:0:36,34
in reality punishes everyone because
we're all interconnected


10
0:0:36,34 --> 0:0:42,9
high taxes and excessive regulation and
massive debt are not working


11
0:0:42,9 --> 0:0:45,19
no republican questions


12
0:0:45,19 --> 0:0:47,5
or speed civil rights


13
0:0:47,5 --> 0:0:51,63
i've never wavered in my support for
civil rights for the civil rights act


14
0:0:51,63 --> 0:0:52,79
dispute


15
0:0:52,79 --> 0:0:57,29
if there is one has always been about
how much of the remedy should come under


16
0:0:57,29 --> 0:0:58,53
federal


17
0:0:58,53 --> 0:0:59,69
or st


18
0:0:59,69 --> 0:1:1,57
or private party


19
0:1:1,57 --> 0:1:4,94
okay hope to get on a lot out of the
bond and


20
0:1:4,94 --> 0:1:8,49
no i mean when it was a frightening for
scholars is that in his first statement


21
0:1:8,49 --> 0:1:11,44
about social security minutes it's
strange because i think it would be to


22
0:1:11,44 --> 0:1:15,499
make this point in the earlier today
that you know he's ideologically opposed


23
0:1:15,499 --> 0:1:20,2
to programs like social security and
medicare suffering in the car


24
0:1:20,2 --> 0:1:23,64
yet it is not that is not interested in
hurting so so it is just it's an


25
0:1:23,64 --> 0:1:28,64
outright lies in military use there was
a solvent so secure on a silent night


26
0:1:28,64 --> 0:1:31,56
here so what he means is we have to cut
benefits


27
0:1:31,56 --> 0:1:34,8
completely until the program doesn't
work anymore it to kill the program


28
0:1:34,8 --> 0:1:38,67
getting that's what he's saying and the
democrats although the budget hostage


29
0:1:38,67 --> 0:1:42,72
yes indeed yes soldier account so that
was kinda he's amused and also said that


30
0:1:42,72 --> 0:1:43,389
uh...


31
0:1:43,389 --> 0:1:46,799
you know high taxes and high debt which
is not working right now


32
0:1:46,799 --> 0:1:50,619
we have the lowest tax rate effectively
then we have since the fifties and i saw


33
0:1:50,619 --> 0:1:54,81
her return yesterday of a proper tax a
personal tax rates are the lowest


34
0:1:54,81 --> 0:1:58,47
penicillin and that's where yes or not
trying that right now what we're


35
0:1:58,47 --> 0:2:1,259
traveling trying is a low taxes


36
0:2:1,259 --> 0:2:3,23
and uh... and a lot of wars


37
0:2:3,23 --> 0:2:4,759
that sort right now it doesn't work


38
0:2:4,759 --> 0:2:7,26
so far so good that we're having a
problem here


39
0:2:7,26 --> 0:2:10,39
and they keep pretending that wall
street is still regulated the problem


40
0:2:10,39 --> 0:2:13,319
with our economy is wall street is
actively


41
0:2:13,319 --> 0:2:15,19
is operating in them


42
0:2:15,19 --> 0:2:19,69
in interest of wall street only so
that's that without regularly was never


43
0:2:19,69 --> 0:2:21,6
mohammed regulations so


44
0:2:21,6 --> 0:2:25,13
it is this whole rewriting of history
that though the right wing seems to do


45
0:2:25,13 --> 0:2:28,22
and then of course in the mainstream
media goes to cover them they have to


46
0:2:28,22 --> 0:2:32,29
pretend that both sides of this is wrong
and just as stupid as david both sides


47
0:2:32,29 --> 0:2:33,499
both sides


48
0:2:33,499 --> 0:2:37,659
that no one really gets me about this is
his attempt at revisionist history


49
0:2:37,659 --> 0:2:40,8
hands-on rights yeah the civil rights
that that the idea


50
0:2:40,8 --> 0:2:45,739
that you know i've been ebay willfully
delicacy willfully ignores the fact that


51
0:2:45,739 --> 0:2:46,37
the law


52
0:2:46,37 --> 0:2:49,249
fundamentally related merrick and
political parties


53
0:2:49,249 --> 0:2:52,369
to the point that they no longer bear
any resemblance to their nineteen


54
0:2:52,369 --> 0:2:56,489
fifties catholic parties fees just
remains wrecked these kids into thinking


55
0:2:56,489 --> 0:3:0,139
that oh well you know martin luther king
he was a republican yell yell back when


56
0:3:0,139 --> 0:3:4,549
the republicans actually listed four you
know nice thanks my head rights and stop


57
0:3:4,549 --> 0:3:8,19
headset it wants the civil rights
legislation was passed


58
0:3:8,19 --> 0:3:12,839
the southern democrats became a republic
and they flew out of the railroad and


59
0:3:12,839 --> 0:3:16,159
monkey and they're now the party and
that's i don't see how he thinks it is


60
0:3:16,159 --> 0:3:19,999
doing without this is that new thing
that the right keeps pushing and i know


61
0:3:19,999 --> 0:3:21,569
of cuz im on face book


62
0:3:21,569 --> 0:3:23,24
and i see this all the time


63
0:3:23,24 --> 0:3:26,73
when they say all you know the democrats
are the racists it was the republicans


64
0:3:26,73 --> 0:3:30,66
that freed the slaves and most of those
rebel and republicans voted for the


65
0:3:30,66 --> 0:3:35,0
civil rights act okay so they again what
you just pointed out big no ring that


66
0:3:35,0 --> 0:3:39,54
the civil rights act which was passed in
nineteen sixty four out when johnson's


67
0:3:39,54 --> 0:3:43,1
sign that he said i'm lou signing away
the south and losing the south of the


68
0:3:43,1 --> 0:3:47,5
democratic party for a generation
because all the racists terry that when


69
0:3:47,5 --> 0:3:51,94
bigots that were in the democratic party
left them for that uh... and went to the


70
0:3:51,94 --> 0:3:53,19
republican party


71
0:3:53,19 --> 0:3:57,52
and that's how we got realigned so yes
back before the civil rights act


72
0:3:57,52 --> 0:4:2,11
the democratic party was just as racist
and just as horrible but since then


73
0:4:2,11 --> 0:4:5,33
the republicans have instituted their
southern strategy


74
0:4:5,33 --> 0:4:11,19
which is too deep too appealed to the
prejudices and fear of minorities in the


75
0:4:11,19 --> 0:4:15,89
southern white right so that in fact to
has worked very well thanks to it's a


76
0:4:15,89 --> 0:4:19,229
lot of the last three republican
chairman has as apologized


77
0:4:19,229 --> 0:4:20,93
for this including michael steele


78
0:4:20,93 --> 0:4:24,159
and uh... ten million had and they had
apologized


79
0:4:24,159 --> 0:4:25,699
for the southern strategy so


80
0:4:25,699 --> 0:4:29,949
ignore recent history they concentrate
on history before nineteen sixty four


81
0:4:29,949 --> 0:4:33,27
and uh... i didn't get to see the whole
speech but due to rain and put them into


82
0:4:33,27 --> 0:4:35,24
the civil rights act in the sixty four


83
0:4:35,24 --> 0:4:39,23
but the rainfall go into these this
african-american let's talk about the


84
0:4:39,23 --> 0:4:44,15
uh... the the voting rights act of
nineteen sixty five that republicans are


85
0:4:44,15 --> 0:4:45,669
now in court


86
0:4:45,669 --> 0:4:49,939
trying to go out did he bring this up
knows even didn't say anything and in


87
0:4:49,939 --> 0:4:53,529
saving bank curtain current legislation
that republican legislators are trying


88
0:4:53,529 --> 0:4:55,67
to put an antenna and more difficult


89
0:4:55,67 --> 0:4:59,67
for people to can't imagine why he would
want to highlight that his speech that


90
0:4:59,67 --> 0:5:3,52
he also said in the senate republicans
are for economic growth they just can't


91
0:5:3,52 --> 0:5:6,569
let that go without answering the fact
is if you go back


92
0:5:6,569 --> 0:5:9,669
on this story as you know as long as ram
paul is in the mood for a month to go


93
0:5:9,669 --> 0:5:11,0
back and look at history


94
0:5:11,0 --> 0:5:15,6
go back and look at the economy go back
and look at the stock market's pullback


95
0:5:15,6 --> 0:5:19,949
it look like any economic measure you
want over the last eighty years


96
0:5:19,949 --> 0:5:20,849
and see


97
0:5:20,849 --> 0:5:24,86
how the stock market it under democrats
how the economy did under republics the


98
0:5:24,86 --> 0:5:26,32
fair one to the other


99
0:5:26,32 --> 0:5:27,18
it's not


100
0:5:27,18 --> 0:5:28,289
even close


101
0:5:28,289 --> 0:5:30,85
democratic policies whether you like
them or not


102
0:5:30,85 --> 0:5:35,29
are more successful economically other
part i wanted to mention he said i never


103
0:5:35,29 --> 0:5:41,8
waivered in my support of civil rights
uh... because he couldn't we don't have


104
0:5:41,8 --> 0:5:44,88
msnbc at our house is saying i get that
there is getting


105
0:5:44,88 --> 0:5:50,51
but he went on in return the palestinian
and and this is a interview that he did


106
0:5:50,51 --> 0:5:53,719
at the louisville courier journal back
in may of two thousand


107
0:5:53,719 --> 0:5:59,2
five don't like the idea of telling
product business a or racism


108
0:5:59,2 --> 0:6:2,929
i think it's a bad business decision
ever exclude anybody from the restaurant


109
0:6:2,929 --> 0:6:6,5
but at the same time i do believe in
private ownership


110
0:6:6,5 --> 0:6:9,86
but i think this should be absolutely no
discrimination in convincing the public


111
0:6:9,86 --> 0:6:14,47
funding and that's what most of what
civil rights act was about to my mind


112
0:6:14,47 --> 0:6:15,46
most of them


113
0:6:15,46 --> 0:6:19,81
uh... you know he he didn't mention the
there that he went on the civil uh...


114
0:6:19,81 --> 0:6:22,69
ridge amana jo was asked what he had
voted for


115
0:6:22,69 --> 0:6:25,96
the civil rights act and that could not
answer that question right


116
0:6:25,96 --> 0:6:27,2
yes other than that


117
0:6:27,2 --> 0:8:27,2
he has and where r these are all right
so there is no landfall
