###32 DITULLIO: HELLO AND WELCOME TO
###33 RIT SPORTSZONE. I'M JOHN
###34 DITULLIO. HILL: AND I'M SHELBY
###35 HILL. DITULLIO: NOW BRICK CITY
###36 HOMECOMING AND FAMILY WEEKEND IS
###37 ANNUALLY ONE OF THE BIGGEST
###39 EVENTS AT RIT, BUT FOR HOCKEY
###41 FANS, THIS YEAR'S EDITION MAY BE
###43 TOUGH TO TOP. HILL: ONE OF THE
###44 MAIN HIGHLIGHTS AGAIN THIS FALL
###46 BROUGHT A SELLOUT CROWD OF OVER
###49 10,000 DOWNTOWN TO THE BLUE
###51 CROSS ARENA. DITULLIO: IT WAS A
###52 SEA OF ORANGE AS WAYNE WILSON
###54 AND THE RIT MEN'S HOCKEY
###55 WELCOMED ST. LAWRENCE TO TOWN.
###57 THIRD PERIOD, SAINTS UP ONE AND
###58 ON THE POWER PLAY PATRICK
###61 DOHERTY SCORES TOP SHELF, HIS
###62 SECOND GOAL IN LESS THAN TWO
###64 MINUTES AND PUT THE SAINTS IN
###65 CONTROL 5 TO 3. ST. LAWRENCE
###67 WENT THREE FOR FIVE ON THE MAN
###69 ADVANTAGE. BUT RIT WOULDN'T
###71 QUITE. BRYAN POTTS SCORES HIS
###73 SECOND GOAL OF THE NIGHT IN THE
###74 POWER PLAY TO BRING RIT TO
###76 WITHIN ONE. UNDER THIRTEEN TO
###79 PLAY IN REGULATION, CAMERON BURT
###81 FIRES ONE IN, ADAM HARTLEY PUTS
###83 IN THE REBOUND WITH JUST NINE
###84 SECONDS REMAINING TO TIE THE
###86 GAME AND FORCED OVERTIME. IN THE
###88 EXTRA SESSION ST. LAWRENCE TURNS
###90 IT OVER AND ADAM MITCHELL SNEAKS
###92 ONE BY MATT WENINGER, JUST 14
###94 SECONDS INTO OVERTIME AS RIT
###95 PULLS OFF A STUNNING 6, 5
###99 VICTORY FOR THE FIRST WIN OF THE
###109 SEASON. HILL: RIT RALLIED FROM A
###111 5, 3 DEFICIENT IN DRAMATIC
###113 FASHION. SCORING WITH JUST NINE
###115 SECONDS LEFT IN THE THIRD PERIOD
###117 AND ONLY 14 SECONDS INTO
###119 OVERTIME, THE TIGERS SEALED THE
###120 DEAL AT A SOLD OUT BRICK CITY
###123 GAME. BATTAGLIA: HERE'S THE
###124 TIGERS IN FRONT, MITCHELL! OH!
###126 AND MITCHELL'S WON IT IN
###127 OVERTIME! HILL: WHAT WAS IT LIKE
###132 WITH NINE SECONDS LEFT AND US
###133 GETTING THE GOAL; HOW DID THAT
###135 FEEL? MITCHELL: OH,
###136 UNBELIEVABLE! THE ADRENALIN RUSH
###137 WAS JUST GOING THROUGH ME,
###139 ESPECIALLY SINCE MY BUDDY HARTS
###140 GET IT, YOU KNOW, JUST OVER THE
###142 MOON! ONE OF THE BEST GAMES I'VE
###143 EVER BEEN A PART OF. HILL:
###144 COMING FROM THE EMOTIONS IN THE
###146 THIRD PERIOD AND BEING UP AND
###147 DOWN, WHAT WAS IT LIKE SCORING
###148 SO QUICKLY IN OVERTIME TO GET
###149 THE VICTORY? MITCHELL: I WAS
###151 STILL HIGH ON THE OTHER GOAL,
###152 YOU KNOW? IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE
###154 HOW QUICKLY WE GOT IT DONE AND
###156 THERE WAS NO DOUBT IN OUR MINDS
###157 WE WERE GOING TO WIN THE HOCKEY
###158 GAME. WILSON: ONCE WE SCORED THE
###160 GOAL AND THEN WE HAD THE LITTLE
###161 BREAK GOING INTO OVERTIME THE
###164 ONE THING WE TALKED ABOUT WAS
###164 THE PLACE IS GOING NUTS, LET'S
###165 USE THIS MOMENTUM AND TRY AND
###167 JUMP ON THEM RIGHT AWAY AND WITH
###168 ONLY FIVE MINUTES OF HOCKEY LEFT
###170 WE WANT TO GET AFTER IT RIGHT
###172 AWAY AND THEY MUST HAVE TAKEN
###173 THOSE WORDS TO HEART BECAUSE THE
###176 FIRST SHIFT WE GET THE WIN. WE
###177 WERE HOPING FOR THAT BECAUSE WE
###178 KNEW THEY WERE GOING TO BE A
###180 LITTLE BIT DOWN GIVING UP A LATE
###181 GOAL AND LIKE I SAID, WITH THE
###182 CROWD, WE WANTED TO JUMP ON THEM
###184 AND WE DID AND IT WAS GREAT.
###185 MITCHELL: I'VE ONLY BEEN HERE
###187 TWO YEARS, BUT TYING LAST YEAR
###188 WAS JUST A TERRIBLE FEELING AND
###190 BEING ABLE TO SCORE THAT GOAL IN
###191 OVERTIME WAS JUST UNBELIEVABLE.
###193 HILL: WHAT HAPPENED TO GET THAT
###194 WINNING GOAL? MITCHELL: I THINK
###196 WE LOST THE FACE OFF AND THE
###197 PUCK WENT UP IN THE AIR AND BURT
###199 ENDED UP WITH IT ON HIS STICK
###202 AND JUST KIND OF MADE A CHIP
###203 PASS TO MCGOWAN, WHO THEN
###204 CHIPPED IT OVER TO ME AND I KIND
###205 OF BOBBLED IT BUT I ENDED UP
###207 SCORING THE GOAL AND THE CROWD
###209 KIND OF WENT NUTS AND IT WAS
###212 JUST AN AMAZING FEELING.
###213 DITULLIO: THERE IT IS; CAREY
###215 COULDN'T CLEAR THE PUCK, BURT
###217 KEEPS IT IN, JUST THROWS IT ON
###218 NET, WHICH HE SHOULD DO, AND
###221 HARTLEY SPINNING AROUND, FINALLY
###223 LOCATES IT. HILL: THAT THIRD
###224 PERIOD GOAL THAT YOU SCORED,
###225 WHAT HAPPENED THERE? HARTLEY:
###226 COACH JUST SAID GO TO THE NET
###228 AND HOPE FOR THE BEST AND I'VE
###229 GOT TO GIVE BURT CREDIT, HE
###231 WORKED HARD, GOT TO THE PUCK,
###232 HELD IT IN AND THREW IT ON NET
###234 AND IT WAS JUST THERE WAITING
###235 FOR ME. HILL: WHAT WAS IT LIKE
###236 GETTING TWO GOALS TONIGHT, FIVE
###237 POINTS, HOW DO YOU THINK THAT
###238 AFFECTED THE TEAM? POTTS: I HOPE
###241 IT ENERGIZED THE TEAM, I WAS
###243 JUST DOING WHAT I HAD TO DO AND
###244 WHAT I COULD DO TO HELP THE TEAM
###245 WIN AND I WAS CONTRIBUTING ON
###247 THE SCORE SHEET TODAY AND IT
###248 FELT GOOD TO FINALLY GET SOME
###249 POINTS ON THE BOARD. WILSON:
###251 CAMERON HAD A VERY GOOD; HE'S
###252 OFF TO A GREAT START THIS YEAR.
###253 HE WANTS TO MAKE THE MOST OF
###254 THIS YEAR, HE WANTS IT TO BE HIS
###255 BEST SEASON AND HE'S OFF TO A
###257 GOOD START. WE'VE GOT A LOT OF
###258 HOCKEY STILL IN FRONT OF US, BUT
###259 IF CAM BURT'S PLAYING VERY WELL
###260 FOR US, THEN IT'S GOING TO BE A
###263 GOOD YEAR FOR US. HILL: WHAT'S
###264 IT FEEL LIKE TO FINALLY WIN HERE
###265 AT BLUE CROSS THE FIRST TIME
###266 EVER? NEW SPEAKER: I WISH I
###267 COULD DESCRIBE IT, BUT THERE
###268 REALLY ARE NO WORDS. YOU SEE ALL
###270 THE SUPPORT THE SCHOOL COMES OUT
###272 WITH AND YOU KNOW, IT'S REALLY
###273 AMAZING. I'M REALLY HAPPY I
###275 PICKED RIT, I CAN TELL YOU THAT
###276 MUCH, JUST BY THE TURNOUT
###276 TONIGHT. NEW SPEAKER: JUST A
###278 WAVE OF EMOTIONS. PERSONALLY, AN
###279 UP AND DOWN GAME, AS A TEAM I
###281 THINK THIS WAS A GOOD ONE TO WIN
###283 FOR US AND HOPEFULLY COME
###285 PLAYOFF TIME, KNOWING THAT WE
###286 WON IN BLUE CROSS WE CAN HAVE A
###288 LITTLE MORE CONFIDENCE WHEN WE
###289 COME IN HERE. NEW SPEAKER: THE
###290 CROWD REALLY HELPS US OUT, PUMPS
###292 US UP, WHEN WE SCORED THAT GOAL
###293 WITH NINE SECONDS LEFT TO TIE IT
###295 UP, IT JUST GETS US ALL JACKED
###297 UP WHEN THE CROWD GOES WILD. NEW
###298 SPEAKER: IT'S JUST GREAT, JUST
###299 GETTING THE SUPPORT FROM THE
###300 FANS AND THE COMMUNITY AND THE
###301 ALUMNI AND YOU KNOW, IT REALLY
###303 FEEDS US AS A TEAM. WHEN WE'RE
###304 DOWN FIVE THREE AND WE HEAR THEM
###305 CHANTING IN THE BACKGROUND IT
###306 REALLY MOTIVATES US TO GO OUT
###307 THERE AND GIVE IT ALL AND TRY TO
###309 COME BACK AND GET THE WIN. YOU
###310 KNOW, IT'S HOMECOMING HERE AT
###312 RIT, PUTTING THE SWEATER ON WAS
###314 GREAT TO HAVE ONE UNDER OUR
###315 BELT. IT'S GOING TO BE MY LAST
###317 ONE SO I DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE
###318 WITH A LOSS AND SEEING ALL THE
###319 ALUMNI AND EVERYBODY GOING CRAZY
###321 AND SEE ALL THE OLDER HOCKEY
###323 PLAYERS THAT PLAYED BEFORE JUST
###324 LOSING IT BEHIND THE GLASS, IT
###325 WAS A GREAT TIME AND I KNOW
###326 THOSE GUYS WERE PROUD OF US AND
###327 WE COULDN'T BE HERE WITHOUT THEM
###329 AND THE WORK THEY PUT INTO IT.
###331 WILSON: IT'S OBVIOUSLY A GREAT
###333 FEELING. LAST YEAR WE TIED THE
###335 GAME; THEY TIED US UP WITH I
###337 THINK A SECOND LEFT AND WE ENDED
###338 UP TYING THE GAME BUT IT DID
###339 FEEL LIKE A LOSS AND WE
###341 REMEMBERED THAT AND I THINK THE
###342 THING THAT STANDS OUT ABOUT THIS
###344 GAME WAS MENTALLY I THOUGHT WE
###346 SHOWED SOME REAL STRONG
###347 STRENGTH. WE GAVE UP A
###348 SHORTHANDED GOAL AND REBOUNDED
###350 FROM THAT AND SCORED OBVIOUSLY A
###352 BIG GOAL TO TIE IT UP AND THEN
###353 GETTING THE WIN GOAL. SO I
###355 THOUGHT EXECUTION WISE WE HAVE
###356 THINGS TO WORK ON, BUT I WAS
###357 VERY HAPPY WHERE WE WERE; I
###358 THOUGHT WE WERE VERY STRONG
###359 MENTALLY TO GET THROUGH SOME
###361 ADVERSITY AND HOPEFULLY THAT
###363 WILL HELP US OUT IN SOME OTHER
###372 SITUATIONS DOWN THE ROAD. HILL:
###373 IT WAS A GAME THAT WILL NO DOUBT
###374 GO DOWN AS ONE OF THE GREATEST
###376 IN RIT HISTORY. IF YOU'D LIKE TO
###377 RELIVE SOME OF THE UNFORGETTABLE
###379 MOMENTS, YOU CAN RIGHT NOW IN
###381 OUR HOCKEY CENTRAL SECTION OF
###384 OUR WEBSITE AT RITSZ.COM.
###385 DITULLIO: NOW STILL TO COME ON
###387 SPORTSZONE, WITH SELLOUTS
###388 BECOMING THE NORM FOR THE MEN'S
###389 HOCKEY TEAM, HOW CLOSE ARE WE TO
###390 SEEING A NEW ARENA ON CAMPUS?
###393 WE'LL HAVE THE LATEST ON RIT'S
###394 CAMPAIGN TO BUILD A NEW HOME FOR
###397 HOCKEY NEXT. YOU'RE WATCHING RIT
###400 SPORTSZONE IN HIGH DEFINITION.
###420 DITULLIO: WELCOME BACK TO
###421 SPORTSZONE. NOW EARLIER THIS
###422 MONTH A MAJOR FACELIFT WAS
###424 COMPLETED AT RITTER ARENA AND
###425 WHILE THE PROJECT DIDN'T ADD ANY
###427 ADDITIONAL SEATING, IT CERTAINLY
###429 PROVIDED SOME MUCH NEEDED
###430 AMENITIES FOR CURRENT AND FUTURE
###433 TIGERS. SZ'S COURTNEY TENANT HAS
###442 THE STORY. TENANT: RITTER ARENA
###443 HAS FINALLY EXPANDED. NOT FOR
###445 THE FANS, BUT FOR THE PLAYERS.
###447 THE THREE AND A HALF MILLION
###448 DOLLAR LOCKER ROOM FACILITIES
###450 WILL NOW BE HOME TO BOTH THE
###453 MEN'S AND WOMEN'S HOCKEY
###456 PROGRAMS. WHAT DOES THE TEAM
###457 THINK OF THE NEW FACILITIES?
###459 WILSON: WELL WE JUST MOVED IN
###460 YESTERDAY, SO THEY'RE PRETTY
###461 EXCITED. WE HAD A GOOD PRACTICE.
###462 I WAS WONDERING IF THEY WERE
###463 GOING TO BE GETTING CARRIED AWAY
###465 BUT I THINK THEY'RE VERY
###466 APPRECIATIVE OF THE FACILITY
###468 THAT WE HAVE. FROM MY
###470 STANDPOINT, IT'S A LOT OF HARD
###471 WORK ON EVERYONE THAT'S PLAYED
###474 BEFORE THEM. NEW SPEAKER: IT'S
###475 KIND OF A TESTAMENT TO THE LAST
###475 COUPLE OF YEARS AND HOW WELL RIT
###477 HOCKEY'S DONE AND I THINK THAT
###480 YOU KNOW, IT'S A BIG STEP
###481 FORWARD. I THINK THAT THE
###483 ORGANIZATION AND THE SCHOOL IS
###483 GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION IN
###485 REGARDS TO ATHLETICS AND I THINK
###487 THAT IT SHOWS THEIR COMMITMENT
###488 TO US AND OUR COMMITMENT TO
###489 THEM. TENANT: SO WHAT DOES THIS
###491 LOCKER ROOM MEAN FOR RECRUITING
###493 PURPOSES? NEW SPEAKER: IT'S
###496 GOING TO GO A LONG WAY. OUR
###497 PROGRAM HAS GROWN SO MUCH, EVEN
###498 IN THE THREE YEARS THAT I'VE
###500 BEEN HERE. GOING INTO MY FOURTH
###502 YEAR, WE WERE HOPING TO GET
###504 SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND THIS
###505 KIND OF EXCEEDS ALL OF OUR
###506 EXPECTATIONS. COMING INTO A
###507 LOCKER ROOM AS A RECRUIT AND
###509 SEEING SOMETHING LIKE THIS, IT'S
###510 A GREAT SELLING POINT. I MEAN I
###512 WOULD BE HARD PRESSED TO FIND
###514 ANOTHER COLLEGE TEAM WITH A
###516 LOCKER ROOM AS NICE AS THIS.
###517 WILSON: THE SPACE THAT'S BEEN
###520 GIVEN TO US FROM OUR
###521 ADMINISTRATION IS OUTSTANDING,
###523 AND IT REALLY IS VERY, VERY
###525 IMPRESSIVE AND I THINK THAT IT
###527 WILL SHOW VERY WELL TO RECRUITS
###528 AS WE BRING THEM IN FOR VISITS.
###530 NEW SPEAKER: THEY TOLD ME WHEN I
###532 WAS RECRUITED THAT IT WOULD BE
###534 READY FOR MY FRESHMAN YEAR,
###535 WHICH THEY DELIVERED SO IT'S
###537 PRETTY EXCITING. TENANT: IS IT
###538 EVERYTHING THAT THEY TOLD YOU IT
###539 WOULD BE? NEW SPEAKER:
###541 EVERYTHING AND MORE, DEFINITELY.
###542 IT'S REALLY NICE. TENANT: WHAT
###544 DOES THE LOCKER ROOM MEAN FOR
###546 BONDING FOR YOU AND YOUR TEAM?
###548 NEW SPEAKER: IT'S DEFINITELY
###550 BIGGER. THE LAST ONE WAS SMALLER
###553 SO WE WERE ABLE TO INTERACT WITH
###554 EACH OTHER EASILY, BUT I THINK
###556 OUR LOCKER ROOM EVERYONE HEARS
###558 US SAYING, 'I CAN'T WAIT TO GO
###559 BACK TO THE DRESSING ROOM! I
###560 JUST WANT TO HANG OUT THERE!'
###561 AND STUFF LIKE THAT, SO IT'S
###562 GOING TO BE GOOD FOR US. WILSON:
###563 WE'VE GOT TO BE A LITTLE BIT
###564 CAREFUL THAT OUR TEAM ISN'T
###565 SPLINTERED SO IF THERE'S FIVE
###566 GUYS IN OUR ROOM, THREE IN THE
###567 TRAINING ROOM, TWO IN THE VIDEO
###569 ROOM AND SO ON, THAT'S ONE THING
###571 I DID LIKE ABOUT OUR OLD ROOM
###572 WAS SMALL AND COZY, WE'LL SAY,
###575 AS IT WAS, IT WAS GREAT FOR I
###578 THINK CHEMISTRY OF THE TEAM,
###580 GETTING TO KNOW THE OTHER GUYS
###581 ON YOUR TEAM VERY WELL BECAUSE
###583 THERE WAS NOWHERE ELSE TO GO. I
###584 THINK WE'LL LOSE A LITTLE BIT OF
###585 THAT, BUT WE'VE TRIED TO MAKE
###587 THIS OUR FOCAL POINT, OUR MAIN
###588 LOCKER ROOM AND KEEP AS MANY
###591 GUYS IN HERE VERSUS SCATTERED IN
###593 ALL THE OTHER FACILITIES. NEW
###594 SPEAKER: I THINK IT DEFINITELY
###595 BOOSTS TEAM MORALE. I THINK EVEN
###597 TODAY, WE MOVED IN LAST NIGHT,
###598 AND TODAY WE HAD A GREAT
###599 PRACTICE, EVERYBODY WAS, YOU
###601 KNOW, THE NEW SOUND SYSTEM AND
###603 PUTTING ON NEW MUSIC AND JUST
###605 KIND OF THE CAMARADERIE THAT
###606 HAPPENS WITH THE GUYS AROUND THE
###609 DRESSING ROOM. I THINK IT'S
###610 DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT WE'RE
###611 PROUD OF AND SOMETHING THAT
###613 FEELS LIKE HOME. NEW SPEAKER:
###614 JUST THE WAY OUR PROGRAM'S GROWN
###616 OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS AND JUST
###618 ALL THE GUYS WHO HAVE PUT SO
###620 MUCH WORK IN, EVEN BEFORE US, TO
###621 HELP BUILD SOMETHING LIKE THIS,
###624 IT'S JUST GOING TO BRING OUR
###625 TEAM CLOSER TOGETHER AND IT JUST
###626 GIVES US ANOTHER THING TO MAKE
###628 RIT HOCKEY EVEN MORE OF A PROUD
###633 TRADITION. HILL: MEANWHILE, IT'S
###635 BEEN ALMOST A YEAR SINCE RIT
###636 ALUMNUS STEVE SCHULTZ DONATED
###637 ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO THE
###639 SCHOOL, OFFICIALLY KICKING OFF
###641 RIT'S CAMPAIGN TO BUILD A NEW
###643 ICE ARENA. SO HOW MUCH PROGRESS
###645 HAS BEEN MADE AND WHEN MIGHT WE
###648 SEE A NEW FACILITY ON CAMPUS? WE
###649 SENT SPORTSZONE'S JOHN DITULLIO
###657 TO FIND OUT. DESTLER: AND STEVE
###658 AND VICKY HAVE PLEDGED ONE
###659 MILLION DOLLARS, THE FIRST
###661 MILLION TOWARDS OUR FIFTEEN
###662 MILLION DOLLAR CAMPAIGN AND I
###665 FOR ONE COULD NOT BE MORE
###668 GRATEFUL (APPLAUSE). DITULLIO:
###669 OK, DOCTOR, IT'S ALMOST BEEN
###670 ABOUT A YEAR SINCE THE
###671 ANNOUNCEMENT FOR A NEW ARENA.
###673 NOW LET'S FAST FORWARD TO TODAY.
###674 WHERE DO WE STAND IN TERMS OF
###676 WHEN DO YOU THINK GROUND CAN BE
###679 BROKEN AND LET'S UPDATE
###680 EVERYBODY ON THE FUNDS AND HOW
###680 CLOSE ARE WE. WATTERS: OUR
###682 PRESIDENT HAS WORKED VERY HARD,
###683 HE HAS SOME VERY, VERY
###684 INTERESTED FOLKS WHO ARE DOING
###685 SOME VERY SERIOUS DELIBERATION
###687 ON A NAMING OPPORTUNITY. WE ARE
###689 VERY HOPEFUL THAT WITHIN A NEAR
###691 TERM WE MIGHT SEE A CULTIVATION
###694 OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS TO THE
###695 POINT WHERE THERE'S AN
###697 ANNOUNCEMENT. HE'S VERY HOPEFUL
###699 THAT SOME OF THESE INDIVIDUALS
###701 REALLY UNDERSTAND THE COMPELLING
###702 CASE THAT WE HAVE, THE TRUE NEED
###703 THAT WE HAVE, SO I CAN'T SAY
###706 ENOUGH ABOUT HOW HARD HE HAS
###707 WORKED TO REALLY MAKE THIS DREAM
###710 COME TRUE. DITULLIO: I KNOW
###711 YOU'VE BEEN AROUND THE COUNTRY
###712 LOOKING AT OTHER FACILITIES.
###714 TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE
###715 AMENITIES, MAYBE WHAT YOU TOOK
###716 AWAY FROM SOME OF THOSE VISITS.
###718 WATTERS: PITTSBURGH DID A
###719 TERRIFIC JOB WITH THE CONSOL
###721 ENERGY ARENA OF BRINGING IN THE
###723 HISTORY OF PITTSBURGH INTO THAT
###725 FACILITY. THEY DID A NUMBER OF
###727 GREAT THINGS THERE. A NUMBER OF
###728 THE CANADIAN CITIES, WHEN THEY
###729 BUILT THEIR ARENAS, THEY BROUGHT
###731 IN THE HISTORY AND LEGACY OF
###733 THEIR PROGRAMS AND SO WE'VE
###734 LEARNED FROM THOSE TRIPS. WE
###737 WILL BRING IN, ELEMENTS FROM
###738 RITTER AND FROM THE ROCHESTER
###740 COMMUNITY INTO IT SO THAT OUR
###742 DEVOTED FANS AND OUR LOYAL FANS
###744 FROM HERE IN ROCHESTER CAN
###745 REALLY FEEL AN AFFINITY WHEN
###747 THEY WALK IN AND IT WILL MAKE
###749 THEM FEEL AT HOME. ONE OF THE
###750 THINGS THAT WE'RE STILL LOOKING
###752 AT IS HOW MUCH OF AN ACTIVITY
###753 CENTER IS IT AS OPPOSED TO HOW
###755 MUCH OF A HOCKEY ARENA IS IT? IF
###759 YOU MOVE TOWARDS A LITTLE BIT
###760 MORE OF AN ACTIVITY CENTER, IT
###762 HAS DEFINITE IMPLICATIONS FOR
###763 THE GRID SYSTEMS OF THE
###764 BUILDING, WHERE YOU SET UP
###766 SUITES SO THAT THEY'RE NOT
###767 BLOCKED OFF. IF YOU PUT IN
###769 CURTAINS FOR PERFORMANCES AND
###771 CONCERTS, SO WE'RE STILL
###773 THINKING THROUGH HOW MUCH OF IT
###775 WILL BE ACTIVITIES BASED VERSUS
###776 PURE HOCKEY, AND IT WILL BE
###778 DESIGNED TO DELIVER EXACTLY WHAT
###779 WE'RE LOOKING FOR. DITULLIO:
###781 WHEN PEOPLE SAY, YOU KNOW, YOU
###782 JUST UPDATED RITTER; WHY BUILD?
###783 WHAT DO YOU TELL THEM? WATTERS:
###784 IT'S LIKELY THAT RITTER WILL
###786 STILL BE VERY ACTIVE AND IT WILL
###789 SERVE THAT FUNCTION THAT SHOULD
###791 THE NEW FACILITY BE USED FOR AN
###792 ACTIVITY, RITTER WILL BE OUR GO
###796 TO PLACE. DITULLIO: WHEN YOU
###797 LOOK AT CAPACITY, ARE WE LOOKING
###799 FOUR, FOUR TO SIX IN TERMS OF
###801 THE SIZE OF THE ARENA? WATTERS:
###803 YES, RIGHT NOW WE HAVE BEEN
###804 TALKING IN THAT FOUR TO FIVE
###805 RANGE AND OUR PRESIDENT YOU
###808 KNOW, IS STILL CONSIDERING
###809 OPTIONS, BUT I THINK THAT AT
###811 THIS POINT HE'S COMFORTABLE IN
###813 HAVING US PURSUE A PROGRAM THAT
###814 WOULD BE IN THAT FOUR TO FIVE
###816 RANGE. DITULLIO: WHERE DO YOU
###819 FORESEE THE NEW ARENA BEING
###819 BUILT? WATTERS: IT LOOKS RIGHT
###821 NOW THAT THE PORTION OF THE
###824 CAMPUS THAT IS IMMEDIATELY SOUTH
###827 OF GLOBAL VILLAGE, HAS RISEN TO
###829 THE TOP OF THE LIST. THERE'S A
###831 LOT OF GREAT THINGS ABOUT IT.
###833 ONE, IT DISBURSES PEOPLE AWAY
###834 FROM THE FIELD HOUSE AND THE
###835 EXISTING ARENA, SO IF WE HAVE
###836 DUAL EVENTS ON CAMPUS WE WOULD
###838 HAVE TRAFFIC AND A LOT OF PEOPLE
###840 MOVE TO A DIFFERENT ELEMENT OF
###842 THE CAMPUS. DITULLIO: SHOVEL IN
###845 THE GROUND IN 2012, DO YOU
###846 THINK? IS THAT A POSSIBILITY?
###848 WATERS: YOU KNOW, IT IS A
###851 POSSIBILITY. WE'RE PROBABLY SIX
###853 TO SEVEN MONTHS OF A DESIGN
###855 PERIOD ONCE WE GET THE GREEN
###857 LIGHT TO GO, SO IF WE WERE TO
###859 SEE THOSE ANNOUNCEMENTS IN THE
###861 NEXT TWO MONTHS, IT'S VERY
###862 LIKELY WE COULD ACTUALLY BE IN
###864 THE GROUND TOWARDS THE LAST PART
###885 HILL: THE RIT WOMEN'S HOCKEY
###886 TEAM NOT ONLY REACHED THE
###888 DIVISION THREE NATIONAL
###889 CHAMPIONSHIP GAME LAST MARCH,
###891 BUT THEY EARNED THE OPPORTUNITY
###893 TO HOST THE GAME ON HOME ICE.
###894 DITULLIO: BUT THE PERFECT
###895 SCENARIO TURNED OUT TO BE THE
###896 PERFECT STORM AS NORWICH STUNG
###898 THE TIGERS AND LEFT TOWN WITH
###900 THE TITLE. EMILY CLARK SAT DOWN
###901 WITH THIS YEAR'S TEAM AND
###903 DISCOVERED THEY HAVE A MAJOR
###907 CHIP ON THEIR SHOULDER. CLARK:
###918 CAN YOU TELL ME A LITTLE BIT
###919 ABOUT THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF LAST
###920 SEASON AND HOW YOU'RE USING IT
###921 AS MOTIVATION FOR THIS YEAR? NEW
###922 SPEAKER: WELL DEFINITELY LAST
###924 SEASON WAS A HUGE
###926 DISAPPOINTMENT, NO ONE WANTED
###927 OUR SEASON TO END LIKE THAT, BUT
###929 WHAT CAN YOU DO? WE DID HAVE A
###932 GOOD, LONG, STRONG YEAR AND SO
###934 AS OF RIGHT NOW I THINK JUST
###935 MOVING PAST THAT GAME, KIND OF
###937 FORGETTING ABOUT IT AS WE DO
###939 HAVE A NEW SEASON, A NEW TEAM,
###940 BUT AT THE SAME TIME,
###942 REMEMBERING HOW DISAPPOINTING
###943 THAT GAME WAS AND HOW
###945 HEARTBREAKING IT WAS. NEW
###946 SPEAKER: IT'S JUST KIND OF
###947 MOTIVATION TO COME OUT NOW WITH
###949 A BANG, PLAY WITH A CHIP ON OUR
###951 SHOULDER, AS WE KIND OF SAY. BUT
###954 EVEN JUST USING THE EXPERIENCE
###956 OF MAKING IT TO THE NATIONAL
###957 CHAMPIONSHIP BECAUSE NOW LIKE
###958 COACH SAYS, WE'VE SEEN IT ALL,
###959 WE'VE BEEN ALL THE WAY SO NOW
###961 IT'S JUST TAKING IT ONE STEP AT
###963 A TIME DURING THE SEASON.
###965 MCDONALD: WE SHOWED THE GIRLS
###966 THE CHAMPIONSHIP VIDEO FROM LAST
###968 YEAR. YOU SHOULDN'T FORGET THE
###970 FEELING OF GOING SO FAR AND THEN
###973 COMING UP THAT SHORT, BEING SO
###974 CLOSE TO SOMETHING. DURING
###976 WORKOUTS I'LL JUST MENTION THAT
###977 WE DON'T WANT A SECOND PLACE
###978 EFFORT ANYMORE; IT'S FIRST PLACE
###982 OR NOTHING NOW. CLARK: COMING
###983 INTO THE NEW SEASON, HOW DO YOU
###984 FEEL YOUR NEW PLAYERS HAVE GROWN
###986 AND DEVELOPED IN THE OFF SEASON?
###987 MCDONALD: IT LOOKS LIKE THEY ALL
###988 CAME BACK A LITTLE BIT MORE
###991 MOTIVATED. NOT THAT THEY'RE NOT
###993 MOTIVATED, BUT I THINK THE WAY
###995 LAST YEAR ENDED IT KIND OF, IT'S
###997 A LONG SUMMER TO BE THINKING
###999 ABOUT THAT LAST GAME AND HOW IT
###1001 FINISHED. THEY LOOK IN SHAPE,
###1002 THEY LOOK QUICKER, THEY LOOK
###1004 STRONGER AND THEY SEEM MORE
###1008 MATURE RIGHT NOW. CLARK: HAVE
###1009 YOU SEEN ANYBODY STEPPING UP
###1010 INTO THE ROLES THAT WERE ONCE
###1012 HELD BY DAGG OR STACK AND HOW
###1013 HAVE YOU GUYS BEEN PRACTICING
###1014 WITHOUT THEM? MCDONALD: YOU
###1016 KNOW, I THINK THE THREE CAPTAINS
###1018 FOR SURE, THERE'S A REASON WHY
###1020 THREE JUNIORS ARE OUR CAPTAINS
###1021 NOW. THEY WERE STARTING TO STEP
###1023 INTO THOSE LEADERSHIP ROLES AT
###1027 THE END OF LAST YEAR AND IN
###1029 SPRING WORKOUTS THEY WERE THE
###1031 THREE THAT REALLY KIND OF TOOK
###1032 CHARGE OF EVERYTHING AND THOSE
###1034 THREE HAVE COMPLETELY EMERGED AS
###1036 THE TRUE LEADERS ON OUR TEAM
###1037 RIGHT NOW. NEW SPEAKER: I THINK
###1038 EVERYONE RETURNING IS KIND OF A
###1040 KEY PLAYER FOR US. WE DON'T
###1041 REALLY HAVE THE ONE STANDOUT
###1042 PLAYER NOW, THE ONE WHO SCORES
###1043 ALL THE GOALS OR GETS ALL THE
###1044 POINTS, SO IT'S KIND OF A
###1046 COMBINED EFFORT FROM EVERYONE ON
###1047 THE TEAM. I DON'T SEE OUR TEAM
###1049 HAVING ONE POWER FORWARD WHO'S
###1050 GOING TO PUT UP 30 GOALS LIKE
###1051 STACK COULD, BUT I DEFINITELY
###1053 THINK WE HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT
###1054 FORWARDS WHO CAN PUT THE PUCK IN
###1056 THE NET AND CAN PUT UP AN EQUAL
###1059 AMOUNT OF POINTS, IT'S GOING TO
###1062 TAKE JUST NOT ONE PERSON, IT'S
###1064 GOING TO BE DIFFERENT PEOPLE.
###1065 IT'S NICE TO SEE DIFFERENT
###1066 PEOPLE STEPPING UP AND STARTING
###1068 TO ADJUST INTO THEIR ROLES SO
###1070 WE'LL SEE HOW IT GOES. CLARK:
###1071 CAN YOU TELL ME A LITTLE BIT
###1074 ABOUT YOUR NEW FRESHMEN CLASS
###1075 AND WHAT YOU'RE HOPING EACH
###1076 PLAYER WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE
###1077 TEAM? MCDONALD: IT'S AN EXCITING
###1078 BUNCH; THEY'RE ALL A LITTLE
###1080 DIFFERENT. THERE'S NO REAL ONE
###1081 PLAYER THAT'S THE SAME. TWO
###1084 FRESHMEN DEFENSEMEN HAVE COME
###1085 IN, THEY LOOK GREAT SO FAR, THEY
###1087 LOOK VERY POISED AND CALM AND
###1089 PLAYED AT A HIGH LEVEL LAST YEAR
###1091 AND THEN THE FOUR FORWARDS,
###1093 THERE'S SOME BIG KIDS, THERE'S
###1094 SOME SMALL ONES, TOUGH ONES AND
###1095 FAST ONES, SO I DON'T THINK, WE
###1099 GRADUATED A LOT OF SCORING, BUT
###1101 I THINK IF THOSE KIDS PLAY THE
###1103 WAY THEY CAN, I DON'T THINK
###1105 WE'LL MISS A BEAT. CLARK: WHAT
###1106 IS THE TEAM REALLY LOOKING HARD
###1107 TO REACH THIS SEASON? NEW
###1108 SPEAKER: AS OF RIGHT NOW, I
###1109 THINK JUST PREPARING FOR THIS
###1111 UPCOMING SEASON AND NOT DWELLING
###1113 ON LAST SEASON. I THINK WE
###1114 SHOULD TAKE THE SEASON ONE GAME
###1115 AT A TIME AND PLAY AS A TEAM,
###1116 PLAY TO OUR FULL POTENTIAL AND
###1119 JUST SEE WHERE THAT GETS US. WE
###1120 DO HAVE SEVEN NEW FRESHMEN, NEW
###1122 PEOPLE, NEW SKILLS, SO JUST KIND
###1124 OF WAIT IT OUT AND WORK HARD AND
###1125 LOOK FORWARD TO THE NEW SEASON.
###1137 AND AUTO. DITULLIO: RIT'S RUGBY
###1147 TEAM FIRST TOOK THE FIELD BACK
###1150 IN 1978. THE CLUB SPORT HAD A
###1153 LONG RUNNING TRADITION UNTIL AN
###1154 OFF CAMPUS INCIDENT LED TO THE
###1156 TEAM BEING BANNED FROM
###1157 COMPETITION FROM THE SCHOOL IN
###1159 2007. HILL: IT'S BEEN A LONG AND
###1160 DIFFICULT ROAD, BUT AS OLIVIA
###1162 ANGEROSA DISCOVERED, AFTER FIVE
###1164 YEARS THE RIT RUGBY PROGRAM IS
###1165 BACK WITH A BRAND NEW ATTITUDE
###1168 AND A CLEAN SLATE. ANGEROSA:
###1176 AFTER A HAZING INCIDENT THAT
###1177 BANNED THEM FROM THE GAME IN
###1178 2007, THE RIT RUGBY TEAM IS
###1179 GIVEN A CHANCE TO PLAY AGAIN.
###1181 HOWEVER, THESE TIGERS MAY HAVE
###1182 TO BOUNCE BACK FROM A BAD REP IN
###1184 ORDER TO GAIN THE SUPPORT THEY
###1185 ONCE HAD. HOW WERE YOU GUYS
###1187 FINALLY ABLE TO GET THE RUGBY
###1189 TEAM BACK AT RIT? NEW SPEAKER:
###1190 IN REALITY, IT'S ALL THANKS TO A
###1192 GUY NAMED JOEL WHITWORD. HE
###1193 ACTUALLY ALREADY GRADUATED, BUT
###1194 HE FOUNDED RIT RUGBY HERE. HE
###1197 WAS ABLE TO TALK TO THE PEOPLE
###1198 HE NEEDED TO, INCLUDING THE
###1199 COLLEGE ACTIVITY BOARD AND THE
###1200 CLUB SPORT AND GET US BACK ON,
###1203 ACTUALLY A YEAR BEFORE WE WERE
###1204 SUPPOSED TO. NEW SPEAKER: IT
###1205 ACTUALLY TOOK A LOT OF HARD
###1206 WORK, BUT AFTER HASSLING THE
###1208 SCHOOL FOR A WHILE AND GETTING
###1210 ENOUGH INTEREST BETWEEN ALL THE
###1213 DIFFERENT STUDENTS, WE WERE
###1214 FINALLY ABLE TO GET ALL THE
###1216 PAPERWORK THROUGH AND GET
###1217 APPROVED AND THEN WE GOT INTO
###1219 THE LEAGUE AFTER A YEAR AND THEN
###1220 NOW WE'RE FOUR AND 0. ANGEROSA:
###1221 AND HOW'S THE TEAM WORKING TO
###1223 GET GOOD STANDING BACK? NEW
###1224 SPEAKER: WELL, WE'VE CHANGED OUR
###1225 COLORS, WE'VE CHANGED OUR NAME,
###1226 THE ENTIRE TEAM IS DIFFERENT,
###1227 THE COACH IS DIFFERENT, THERE'S
###1229 ABSOLUTELY NOTHING BETWEEN US
###1231 AND THAT TEAM. WE'VE KEPT IN
###1233 TOUCH WITH THE OLD ALUMNI, BUT
###1235 AT THE SAME TIME WE'VE MADE SURE
###1236 TO DISTANCE OURSELVES FROM THAT
###1238 ACTUAL EVENT THAT HAPPENED THAT
###1240 GAVE US SUCH A BAD REPUTATION IN
###1241 THE FIRST PLACE. NEW SPEAKER: WE
###1242 MAKE SURE THAT THESE GUYS ARE
###1243 MAKING HIGH ACADEMIC STANDARDS
###1244 FOR THEMSELVES. ONE OF THE
###1245 THINGS TOO IS THE FACT THAT WHEN
###1246 WE GO AND PLAY OTHER TEAMS, WE
###1248 DON'T ALLOW DIRTY PLAY AND WE
###1249 MAKE A REAL STRONG POINT TO TALK
###1250 TO THE REF BEFOREHAND AND LET
###1251 HIM KNOW THAT IF ANY OF OUR
###1252 PLAYERS ARE PLAYING DIRTY,
###1253 THEY'RE GETTING KICKED OFF THE
###1254 CLUB. ANGEROSA: AND DO YOU FEEL
###1255 LIKE YOU GUYS ARE STILL UNDER
###1256 CLOSE WATCH? NEW SPEAKER: YEAH,
###1257 WE'RE DEFINITELY GETTING WATCHED
###1260 PRETTY SCRUTINOUSLY, BUT WE'RE
###1262 MANAGING AND WE'RE ALSO MAKING
###1264 SURE WE DON'T DO ANYTHING THAT
###1265 MAKES IT SO WE NEED TO BE
###1266 WATCHED, BECAUSE THE LAST THING
###1268 WE WANT IS TO NOT BE ABLE TO
###1269 PLAY RUGBY JUST BECAUSE OF SOME
###1271 STUPID INCIDENT HAPPENING.
###1272 ANGEROSA: HOW DID YOU HANDLE NOT
###1274 HAVING A RUGBY TEAM AT RIT? NEW
###1275 SPEAKER: FOR, I WOULD SAY, THREE
###1277 YEARS, I WAS GOING TO THE MEN'S
###1279 CLUB AND PLAYING WITH THE
###1280 AARDVARKS, WHICH IS ONE OF TWO
###1282 MEN'S CLUBS IN ROCHESTER, THE
###1283 AARDVARKS AND THE COLONIALS, SO
###1285 MOST OF THE GUYS JUST WENT BACK
###1286 AND FORTH BETWEEN THOSE TWO
###1287 TEAMS AND WE WERE STILL ABLE TO
###1289 PLAY, BUT IT'S NOT THE SAME NOT
###1290 BEING ABLE TO PLAY FOR AND
###1292 SUPPORT YOUR OWN SCHOOL. NEW
###1293 SPEAKER: I DIDN'T GET INTO RUGBY
###1294 UNTIL I SAW THE FLYER THAT THE
###1295 FIRST PRESIDENT, JOEL WHITWORD,
###1296 HAD POSTED UP AFTER RESTARTING
###1298 THE TEAM AT RIT, SO I HAD NEVER
###1299 ACTUALLY EXPERIENCED THE
###1301 ORIGINAL RIT RUGBY, BUT COMING
###1302 INTO IT, IT WAS KIND OF A COOL,
###1303 FRESH FEELING BECAUSE WE GOT A
###1304 CHANCE TO ACTUALLY START
###1306 SOMETHING NEW. IT WAS COOL TO BE
###1308 A PART OF THAT TRADITION TOO.
###1310 NEW SPEAKER: MY FRESHMAN YEAR I
###1312 MET JOEL AND I STARTED PLAYING
###1315 WITH THE AARDVARKS MEN'S CLUB
###1318 NEARBY, SO THAT'S HOW I STARTED
###1320 GETTING INTO RUGBY AND NOW IT'S
###1323 A LOT OF FUN. IT WAS GREAT TO
###1324 GET INTO THE SPORT BEFORE
###1326 STARTING TO PLAY WITH RIT.
###1327 ANGEROSA: AND HOW DID YOU CHANGE
###1328 THE RUGBY CULTURE AT RIT? NEW
###1330 SPEAKER: THE MAIN THING
###1332 OBVIOUSLY IS FOCUSING ON RUGBY
###1333 INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON THE
###1333 SOCIAL ASPECT OF RUGBY, BECAUSE
###1334 FOCUSING ON THAT ASPECT
###1335 OBVIOUSLY GOT US IN TROUBLE. SO
###1338 WE DEFINITELY CHANGED THAT AND
###1340 AS YOU CAN SEE, WE'RE FOCUSING
###1341 ON RUGBY AND WE'RE WINNING. NEW
###1343 SPEAKER: I'D SAY A DRASTIC
###1344 CHANGE. NOBODY EVEN KNEW ABOUT
###1345 RUGBY; HALF THE PEOPLE JUST
###1346 THOUGHT RUGBY WAS SOME SPORT
###1347 GUYS JUST BEAT ON EACH OTHER,
###1349 AND NOW WHEN THEY COME OUT AND
###1350 SEE IT, HOPEFULLY WE'LL HAVE
###1351 MORE AND MORE PEOPLE COME OUT,
###1352 BUT JUST KNOWLEDGE OF THE GAME,
###1353 I GUESS, SO THAT PEOPLE KNOW
###1355 THAT WE HAVE RUGBY AND BEFORE
###1357 THEY DIDN'T. ANGEROSA: DO YOU
###1358 STILL FEEL LIKE THE TEAM IS
###1359 GETTING ADEQUATE SUPPORT FROM
###1360 THE RIT COMMUNITY? NEW SPEAKER:
###1361 WITH OUR FIRST TWO HOME GAMES,
###1362 WE'VE DEFINITELY SEEN A LOT OF
###1364 PEOPLE COMING OUT, ESPECIALLY
###1366 THE LAST HOME GAME WHERE IT WAS
###1367 KIND OF CRAPPY WEATHER. GET THEM
###1369 OUT ON THE SIDELINES. NEW
###1372 SPEAKER: IT'S NICE JUST HAVING
###1373 PEOPLE KNOW, EVEN IF THEY DON'T
###1374 KNOW HOW TO PLAY THE SPORT O
###1376 RUGBY, THEY STILL COME OUT TO
###1377 WATCH THE GAME AND THEY SEEM TO
###1378 ENJOY IT. NEW SPEAKER: EVER
###1380 SINCE WE STARTED BACK UP, WE'RE
###1381 SLOWLY GETTING MORE AND MORE
###1382 SUPPORT. WE STARTED OFF WITH NO
###1384 FUNDS FROM THE SCHOOL LAST YEAR,
###1385 AND WE'VE ALREADY INCREASED THAT
###1388 FROM ZERO TO $1,400 AND WE HAVE
###1390 AN ACADEMIC ADVISOR, WE WERE
###1393 ACTUALLY GIVEN FOR FREE ONE OF
###1393 THE AUDITORIUMS TO USE FOR FREE
###1394 EVERY SINGLE FRIDAY. THE
###1395 COMMUNITY HAS BEEN VERY
###1397 SUPPORTIVE AND VERY HELPFUL AND
###1398 WITHOUT THEM I'M NOT SURE WE
###1399 WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET THIS
###1400 FAR AS QUICKLY AS WE DID.
###1407 DITULLIO: WELL THAT DOES IT FOR
###1408 THIS EDITION OF RIT SPORTSZONE.
