0:1:41,5 --> 0:1:43,46
I hear about him doing shit
sometimes and shit.


43
0:1:43,46 --> 0:1:46,26
But he used to be able to go to
a spot, any spot you take


44
0:1:46,26 --> 0:1:47,68
him to, and he'd fucking get
a trick no matter what.


45
0:1:47,68 --> 0:1:51,636
ANTWUAN DIXON: Ha, ha, shit.


46
0:1:51,636 --> 0:1:53,38

47
0:1:53,38 --> 0:1:54,78
ERIK ELLINGTON: I think a
combination of a lot of things


48
0:1:54,78 --> 0:1:55,92
distracted him from skating.

50
0:1:57,456 --> 0:1:57,89
ERIK ELLINGTON: I don't know.

I mean, there's a
lot of things.


52
0:1:59,17 --> 0:2:1,22
I don't really want to get
too personal with it.


53
0:2:1,22 --> 0:2:3,19
ANDREW REYNOLDS: I mean, I know
I had a conversation once


54
0:2:3,19 --> 0:2:5,11
with him about filming
a video part.


55
0:2:5,11 --> 0:2:6,36
And I'm like--


56
0:2:6,36 --> 0:2:8,59



57
0:2:8,59 --> 0:2:12,4
pretty much his type
of skating.


58
0:2:12,4 --> 0:2:16,22
It's not quantity that people
are really looking for.


59
0:2:16,22 --> 0:2:19,86
So I'm like, if you get one
trick a month for the time


60
0:2:19,86 --> 0:2:22,5
you're filming for the video,
then you could go on and be a


61
0:2:22,5 --> 0:2:26,4
pro skater and make money
for a long time.


62
0:2:26,4 --> 0:2:29,12
That's it.


63
0:2:29,12 --> 0:2:31,99
But then he says he's
gonna get on it.


64
0:2:31,99 --> 0:2:35,99
I talk to him occasionally when
I see him and always say,


65
0:2:35,99 --> 0:2:39,13
like, let's go skate.


66
0:2:39,13 --> 0:2:40,1
Or are you gonna skate?


67
0:2:40,1 --> 0:2:43,2
It's like he wants to skate,
but it's just--


68
0:2:43,2 --> 0:2:43,59
I don't know.


69
0:2:43,59 --> 0:2:46,17
Like I said, that other stuff
just gets in the way, I think.


70
0:2:46,17 --> 0:2:50,51

go skating with Andrew?


71

0:3:3,96 --> 0:3:5,7
ANDREW REYNOLDS: He's
just funny.


79
0:3:5,7 --> 0:3:8,41
Like, he doesn't really
understand that a bad hangover


80
0:3:8,41 --> 0:3:11,68
is going to mess
up his skating.


81
0:3:11,68 --> 0:3:14,11
I'm like, well, just get up.

0:3:14,85 --> 0:3:15,92

84
0:3:15,92 --> 0:3:18,1
He's like, I feel bad in the
morning, though, man.


85
0:3:18,1 --> 0:3:19,9
I'm just, like, tired
and shit, man.


86
0:3:19,9 --> 0:3:22,16
It's like, all right.


87
0:3:22,16 --> 0:3:24,29
LIZARD KING: He's rad
to go on tour with.


88
0:3:24,29 --> 0:3:27,34
Like, sometimes I'll see
him fucking trying to


89
0:3:27,34 --> 0:3:28,53
fight me and shit.


90
0:3:28,53 --> 0:3:32,98
He'll be my best friend, like
hanging out with me, buying me


91
0:3:32,98 --> 0:3:34,7
little toys and shit.


92
0:3:34,7 --> 0:3:36,67
And then next thing I
know, he's wasted.


93
0:3:36,67 --> 0:3:40,45
And I say something, and he's so
offended that he's swinging


94
0:3:40,45 --> 0:3:42,32
at me, punching me in
the face and shit.


95

punch a cop maybe?

been around him when he's

that was intense.


106
0:4:10,47 --> 0:4:14,9

208
0:7:35,7 --> 0:7:37,3
ANTWUAN DIXON: Motherfucker's
all, he works here, blah,


209
0:7:37,3 --> 0:7:38,1
blah, blah.


210
0:7:38,1 --> 0:7:38,755
Nigger, I don't give a fuck.


211
0:7:38,755 --> 0:7:41,5
He wanna act like he a gangster,
he in the parking


212
0:7:41,5 --> 0:7:42,84
lot, then let's see,
my nigger.


213
0:7:42,84 --> 0:7:43,56
I need that.


214
0:7:43,56 --> 0:7:44,406
Oh, you got that.


215
0:7:44,406 --> 0:7:45,774
It's nothing.


216
0:7:45,774 --> 0:7:46,686
You know what I'm saying?


217
0:7:46,686 --> 0:7:47,75
Niggers ain't turn down.


218
0:7:47,75 --> 0:7:48,732
Niggers get turned up, nigger.


219
0:7:48,732 --> 0:7:50,205
[LAUGHTER]


220
0:7:50,205 --> 0:7:53,0
ERIK ELLINGTON: I just think
that's stuff that he's working


221
0:7:53,0 --> 0:7:55,81
through, like personal issues
that he's working through.


222
0:7:55,81 --> 0:7:58,55
And he's got some of them.


223
0:7:58,55 --> 0:8:1,36
And I think that that should
probably just be kept between


224
0:8:1,36 --> 0:8:4,54
him and whoever he wants
to know about it.


225
0:8:4,54 --> 0:8:6,25
It's not really my place
to talk about it.


226
0:8:6,25 --> 0:8:10,124
But everybody kind
of knows what.


227
0:8:10,124 --> 0:8:11,405
He can get into some trouble.


228
0:8:11,405 --> 0:8:13,91

0:10:12,535 --> 0:10:13,36
Ha!

295
0:10:14,61 --> 0:10:17,3



296
0:10:17,3 --> 0:10:18,98
