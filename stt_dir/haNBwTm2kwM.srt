in the field somewhere.

thank you sir.

just cross real low.

should just make a

0:1:37,965 --> 0:1:40,472

15
0:1:40,472 --> 0:1:43,64
What we hope right now is that
the Americans still control


16
0:1:43,64 --> 0:1:46,28
the fire base, and that
we can hole up there


17
0:1:46,28 --> 0:1:49,0
for a little bit.

Should we yell, don't
shoot, reporters?

I'm kind of holding my hands
out in a surrender gesture,

0:1:54,18 --> 0:1:57,993
which I figure is definitely
in keeping with the kind of

craven in nature of the role
I've chosen for myself.

louder they can hear our

still under American control,

THOMAS MORTON: What occurred
to your unit tonight?

BILL BURGESS: Well, think
mainly what we've


59
0:4:2,66 --> 0:4:6,41
got is light VC probe.


60
0:4:6,41 --> 0:4:8,33
They're just trying to find
out how many we've got in


61

holding the position.

this happen often?

BILL BURGESS: Every night, yeah
Charlie owns the night.


64
0:4:16,5 --> 0:4:23,8
All we can do is hunker down and
try to keep the body count


65
0:4:23,8 --> 0:4:24,55
to a minimum.

0:4:24,55 --> 0:4:28,33
What's going on back
in the world?

THOMAS MORTON: Not much, there's
a new Doors album


68
0:4:30,105 --> 0:4:34,62
that's pretty decent if you
like that kind of stuff.

How was Korea compared
to here?

to distant lands and meet

to do what's called a RON,

a spot, a hiding hole,

that's tricky about Vietnam,

back to a much larger Nam

re-enact soldier misconduct.

the heroics of, say, Antietam

center stage over the

THOMAS MORTON: We've got
a lot of prisoners


208
0:9:42,67 --> 0:9:43,45
kind of lined up here.


209
0:9:43,45 --> 0:9:46,55
They've been sort of taunting
them for a little while.


210
0:9:46,55 --> 0:9:49,9
And now appear to be ready
to execute them,


211
0:9:49,9 --> 0:9:51,94
summarily, which does not--


212
0:9:51,94 --> 0:9:55,52
not really in fitting with,
like, the best of image of US


213
0:9:55,52 --> 0:9:58,535
soldiers in Vietnam.

the camera off.

0:10:1,3 --> 0:10:1,73
Cut the camera off.

to cut the camera off?

THOMAS MORTON: Why do we need
to cut the camera off?

0:10:5,31 --> 0:10:8,52
We're here of our
own volition.

0:10:8,52 --> 0:10:12,68
We're Americans trying
to cover this war.

-Anybody want to say anything?

just murder someone?

THOMAS MORTON: The soldiers
we've been with this whole

0:10:30,59 --> 0:10:33,71
time are summarily executing
their VC.


233
0:10:33,71 --> 0:10:36,44
Excuse me, excuse me,
we're filming.

0:10:36,44 --> 0:10:37,286
-Ah!


235
0:10:37,286 --> 0:10:40,28
We asked to turn
the camera off.

0:10:40,28 --> 0:10:41,15
THOMAS MORTON: What's
going on here?


237
0:10:41,15 --> 0:10:43,63
Shouldn't these people be
turned over to army


238
0:10:43,63 --> 0:10:44,46
intelligence?


239
0:10:44,46 --> 0:10:46,84
-They are being turned over
to army intelligence.

THOMAS MORTON: How
do you figure?


241
0:10:48,13 --> 0:10:49,222
-See, we've got this nice piece
of intelligence right


242
0:10:49,222 --> 0:10:51,352
here-- this SKS.


243
0:10:51,352 --> 0:10:55,13
That's all the Army
needs to see.


244
0:10:55,13 --> 0:10:57,68
THOMAS MORTON: Wouldn't these
prisoners be more valuable to


245
0:10:57,68 --> 0:10:58,47
the army alive?


246
0:10:58,47 --> 0:10:59,86
-I don't see any prisoners.


247
0:10:59,86 --> 0:11:4,63
I just see NVA shooting at us.


248
0:11:4,63 --> 0:11:6,3
THOMAS MORTON: Do you worry
about the effect that these


249
0:11:6,3 --> 0:11:10,21
images will have on the
broadcast back to America?


250
0:11:10,21 --> 0:11:12,4
-I think we're doing
everything we


251
0:11:12,4 --> 0:11:13,19
need to over here.


252
0:11:13,19 --> 0:11:14,37

fucking gooks trying


255
0:11:16,625 --> 0:11:17,92
to get up and leave?

Wow, just running out of here.

THOMAS MORTON: So we just
witnessed a war crime.


259
0:11:25,67 --> 0:11:37,85
You can see there are 1, 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, VC


260
0:11:37,85 --> 0:11:41,228
soldiers who had surrendered.


261
0:11:41,228 --> 0:11:50,3
Or just-- no, I'm sorry, 12,
summarily executed by American


262
0:11:50,3 --> 0:11:53,4
soldiers out here in
the field with an


263
0:11:53,4 --> 0:11:56,1
utter sense of impunity.


264
0:11:56,1 --> 0:12:0,76
Kind of not a great look for the
American Army, you know?

unpack everything we've just


267
0:12:11,8 --> 0:12:13,59
been through in the last day.


268
0:12:13,59 --> 0:12:16,34
I feel like the reenactment
may have been effective in


269
0:12:16,34 --> 0:12:20,9
really blurring the lines
between doing this for play


270
0:12:20,9 --> 0:12:26,99
and trying to fully recreate the
historical reality of Nam.


271
0:12:26,99 --> 0:12:29,83
On the one hand, it's a hobby, a
way to hang out your buddies


272
0:12:29,83 --> 0:12:31,19
and have a good weekend.


273
0:12:31,19 --> 0:12:33,52
On the other hand, the whole
point of that hobby is to


274
0:12:33,52 --> 0:12:35,76
immerse yourself in the most
awful experience most men will


275
0:12:35,76 --> 0:12:39,55
ever live through, which kind
of hits home at the


276
0:12:39,55 --> 0:12:41,84
fundamental paradox
of war itself.


277
0:12:41,84 --> 0:12:44,37
That is to say, in the words
of William Tecumseh


278
0:12:44,37 --> 0:12:46,95
Sherman, it's hell.

Although, in the words of
Spacemen Three, I think I'll

0:12:49,25 --> 0:12:52,67
be in good company down there
with all my friends.

All this reporter knows is that
the things I've seen here


282
0:12:55,9 --> 0:12:58,9
will stay with me until the end
of my days, and forever

haunt my dreams.
