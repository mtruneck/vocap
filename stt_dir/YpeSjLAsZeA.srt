Howdy Food Tube, it's Barry here from My Virgin
Kitchen. Now one of my favourite sweets/candy


2
0:0:8,41 --> 0:0:11,889
when I was growing up, and even still now
when I think about it, was something called


3
0:0:11,889 --> 0:0:14,459
Rolos. Now you might not have them in your
country, you might just call them caramel


4
0:0:14,459 --> 0:0:18,869
cups but here's a really cool way to make
them from home. They taste amazing, it's a


5
0:0:18,869 --> 0:0:28,5
great, fun activity for you to try out using
a shot glass. Good times!


6
0:0:28,5 --> 0:0:32,78
They look amazing right and trust me they
taste amazing but this is also just a little


7
0:0:32,78 --> 0:0:36,57
bit of a fun activity for you guys to try
out. I made a giant one of these over on the


8
0:0:36,57 --> 0:0:40,28
channel before and you guys loved that and
have asked me to scale it down so by using


9
0:0:40,28 --> 0:0:44,19
shot glasses we can do just that.
So if you wanna have a go at doing this, hit


10
0:0:44,19 --> 0:0:48,67
pause on the video now. Write these ingredients/tools
down and this is how you do it.


11
0:0:48,67 --> 0:0:52,68
First up, grab your saucepan with a little
bit of water in there and plonk a mixing bowl


12
0:0:52,68 --> 0:0:56,96
on top. So we're gonna bring that water up
to a simmer and then plonk in our bits of


13
0:0:56,96 --> 0:1:0,76
chocolate letting it melt together naturally.
Now while that chocolates melting I need to


14
0:1:0,76 --> 0:1:5,47
stress to you the importance of lubrication
during this video. Please don't take that


15
0:1:5,47 --> 0:1:7,89
the wrong way. I'm talking about your shot
glasses. You need to make sure you've got


16
0:1:7,89 --> 0:1:11,56
a little bit of butter just worked around there
or some spray oil otherwise if you just pour


17
0:1:11,56 --> 0:1:15,62
the melted chocolate in, once it's set you'll
find it really hard to get out so make sure


18
0:1:15,62 --> 0:1:19,4
you're nice and lubricated.
With the chocolate fully melted pour it into


19
0:1:19,4 --> 0:1:23,6
your shot glasses and then it's time to start
thinking about what sort of plug you're gonna


20
0:1:23,6 --> 0:1:27,37
use which is gonna form your chocolate bucket.
Now in an ideal world, and when I tested this concept


21
0:1:27,37 --> 0:1:31,14
the other day, the best thing to use is the
cork from like a wine bottle wrapped in


22
0:1:31,14 --> 0:1:35,57
foil, again lubricated.
Now unfortunately I didn't have any of those


23
0:1:35,57 --> 0:1:39,82
corks leftover from when I experimented because
my partner, Mrs Barry, chucked them all out


24
0:1:39,82 --> 0:1:44,61
so I had to use party poppers, woo!
So yeah I ended up using party poppers which


25
0:1:44,61 --> 0:1:49,84
I washed out fully, wrapped in foil and then
lubricated in my spray oil. Now ideally you


26
0:1:49,84 --> 0:1:52,82
wanna use the corks, or depending on the size
of your shot glasses you want something that's


27
0:1:52,82 --> 0:1:57,5
slightly less of that width so that when you
push it in its gonna go up the sides and form


28
0:1:57,5 --> 0:2:0,94
a chocolate bucket around it.
Once that chocolate is setting in the fridge


29
0:2:0,94 --> 0:2:5,31
grab another mixing bowl over simmering water
and plonk in your favourite toffees and a


30
0:2:5,31 --> 0:2:9,53
little bit of cream, stirring it together
over that heat until it all combines to make


31
0:2:9,53 --> 0:2:12,519
a lovely, gorgeous filling for our chocolate
bucket.


32
0:2:12,519 --> 0:2:20,93
Hello! Hello, what are your favourite sweets?
Let my daddy know down below. Hello!


33
0:2:20,93 --> 0:2:25,459
And once the chocolate has set you wanna carefully
remove whatever plug device you've used to


34
0:2:25,459 --> 0:2:29,2
reveal your chocolate bucket. Now add your
filling in there that we've made. Make sure


35
0:2:29,2 --> 0:2:33,9
it's cooled otherwise the chocolate bucket
will melt and just fill it just under the


36
0:2:33,9 --> 0:2:36,59
brim of the bucket. So once the filling has
set, it's normally about half an hour in the


37
0:2:36,59 --> 0:2:40,54
fridge just to get a little skim on the top,
melt up some more chocolate and pour it all


38
0:2:40,54 --> 0:2:44,169
over that and that effectively creates the
base of our bucket.


39
0:2:44,169 --> 0:2:48,4
So whack it in the fridge again for a good
hour to set it all together and then all you've


40
0:2:48,4 --> 0:2:52,439
gotta do is un-tap it like a little sandcastle.
That oil in there will help it slide out and


41
0:2:52,439 --> 0:3:1,459
you've made it. Good times.
I'm just gonna go like this. Oh my goodness.


42
0:3:1,459 --> 0:3:6,139
Mmmm! I'm a little bit addicted, I've just
had two of them and they taste amazing! They're


43
0:3:6,139 --> 0:3:10,29
like three of four times the size of the ones
you get in the stores, they taste just like


44
0:3:10,29 --> 0:3:13,45
it, obviously you can pimp up the filling
as you like. If you do make them, do use the


45
0:3:13,45 --> 0:3:16,7
cork method. They're a little bit easier and
a bit more give in there to get out. But if


46
0:3:16,7 --> 0:3:20,239
