16
0:1:8,327 --> 0:1:11,407
'Message deleted.'


17
0:1:11,407 --> 0:1:16,247
You! Where have you been? It's a busy
weekend. You'll be doing triple shifts.


18
0:1:16,247 --> 0:1:19,87
I was going to see some friends, actually.


19
0:1:19,87 --> 0:1:22,727
- Has anyone called?
- No, not a soul.


20
0:1:22,727 --> 0:1:25,127
Nobody rings me these days, Bernard.


21
0:1:25,127 --> 0:1:30,767
It's a mystery, what with you owning
sandals and having egg in your beard.


22
0:1:30,767 --> 0:1:32,807
Hey, Manny, guess what.


23
0:1:32,807 --> 0:1:35,967
I bumped into Paul
and he's invited me as well.


24
0:1:35,967 --> 0:1:37,887
- To what?
- The reggae barbecue.


25
0:1:37,887 --> 0:1:40,687
- He said he left you a message.
- No.


26
0:1:40,687 --> 0:1:42,927
No one's called here.


27
0:1:42,927 --> 0:1:45,47
Oh, look, you've got a message.


28
0:1:45,47 --> 0:1:49,207
No, that light means
the machine needs more salt.


29
0:1:49,207 --> 0:1:52,407
Don't touch it. Don't touch it!
Don't touch it!


30
0:1:52,407 --> 0:1:54,247
(Beep)


31
0:1:54,247 --> 0:1:56,7
(Woman) 'Manny,


32
0:1:56,7 --> 0:1:58,47
- 'it's your mum.'
- Oh, God.


33
0:1:58,47 --> 0:2:1,767
'We left a message to say
we were coming for the weekend


34
0:2:1,767 --> 0:2:3,807
'and you didn't ring us back


35
0:2:3,807 --> 0:2:6,287
- 'so we assumed it was OK.'
- What?


36
0:2:6,287 --> 0:2:9,887
'We should get there
some time between 5:45


37
0:2:9,887 --> 0:2:13,647
'and 5:47.'


38
0:2:13,647 --> 0:2:17,247
Bernard, will it be all right
if my mum and dad stay?


39
0:2:17,247 --> 0:2:19,847
Absolutely not, it's a busy weekend.


40
0:2:19,847 --> 0:2:23,727
B-b-but they're coming!
They're driving hundreds of miles!


41
0:2:23,727 --> 0:2:28,647
Arguing about why Auntie Dora snubbed
Auntie Nora in 1953!


42
0:2:28,647 --> 0:2:31,87
- What am I gonna say?
- I don't care.


43
0:2:31,87 --> 0:2:33,727
- But they-they...
- It's not my problem.


44
0:2:33,727 --> 0:2:37,367
I'm not having my house infected
with the kind of specimens


45
0:2:37,367 --> 0:2:41,287
capable of producing you.


46
0:2:41,287 --> 0:2:43,207
Bernard.


47
0:2:43,207 --> 0:2:45,927
Can I have a little chat? Just for a mo.


48
0:2:45,927 --> 0:2:49,167
No.


49
0:2:49,167 --> 0:2:51,247
Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah!


50
0:2:51,247 --> 0:2:54,327
Ah! Ahh!


51
0:2:54,327 --> 0:2:59,247
(Clattering crash)


52
0:2:59,247 --> 0:3:3,407
- You are being very mean to Manny.
- I can't help it.


53
0:3:3,407 --> 0:3:7,87
He looks like a horse in a man costume.


54
0:3:7,87 --> 0:3:11,647
It's just his mum and dad for a weekend.
Why can't he have them round?


55
0:3:11,647 --> 0:3:14,87
Yeah, well, that's easy for you to say.


56
0:3:14,87 --> 0:3:17,407
You'll be off on the barge
trying to find your booty


57
0:3:17,407 --> 0:3:19,447
in a haze of gange an' ting.


58
0:3:19,447 --> 0:3:22,607
How did you know it was on a barge?


59
0:3:22,607 --> 0:3:25,207
I didn't. I don't. I... I don't.


60
0:3:25,207 --> 0:3:28,487
- I...
- You nasty man.


61
0:3:28,487 --> 0:3:30,767
You've been screening his calls.


62
0:3:30,767 --> 0:3:35,327
Well, he doesn't need friends. They're
bad for him, they make him giddy.


63
0:3:35,327 --> 0:3:38,7
Let his mum and dad stay or I'll tell him.


64
0:3:38,7 --> 0:3:41,367
- What if I did? Would you help?
- Absolutely not.


65
0:3:41,367 --> 0:3:46,207
(West Indian accent) I be on the boat,
far away from the parent-clot.


66
0:3:46,207 --> 0:3:49,527
(Kisses teeth) Cha!


67
0:3:49,527 --> 0:3:52,327
Fine, they're not staying.


68
0:3:52,327 --> 0:3:54,647
All right, all right, I'll be here.


69
0:3:54,647 --> 0:3:56,407
It'll be fun.


70
0:3:56,407 --> 0:4:3,207
Really? Well, I want that in writing.


71
0:4:3,207 --> 0:4:6,207
It'II... be... fun.


72
0:4:6,207 --> 0:4:7,727
Sign it. Sign it.


73
0:4:7,727 --> 0:4:16,127
Signed Fran Katzenjammer.


74
0:4:16,127 --> 0:4:19,567
- All right, all right, they can stay.
- Thanks, Bernard!


75
0:4:19,567 --> 0:4:22,247
That's fantastic! They're staying!


76
0:4:22,247 --> 0:4:25,527
They're staying! Aghh!


77
0:4:25,527 --> 0:4:29,87
I can't breathe!
The walls... The walls are closing in!


78
0:4:29,87 --> 0:4:32,767
- Stop it! Stop dying!
- Oh! Oh, God.


79
0:4:32,767 --> 0:4:35,167
- God! Arrrgh!
- It's only your parents.


80
0:4:35,167 --> 0:4:39,607
- Oh, God! God! Arrrgh! Arrgh!
- He's hysterical. Leave him to me.


81
0:4:39,607 --> 0:4:41,647
- Ohhh... ohh.
- Clear out.


82
0:4:41,647 --> 0:4:45,7
CALM DOWN! CALM DOWN!
CALM DOWN!


83
0:4:45,7 --> 0:4:47,47
(Screaming)


84
0:4:47,47 --> 0:4:49,327
- (Grunting)
- OK, deep breaths.


85
0:4:49,327 --> 0:4:51,247
(Inhales noisily)


86
0:4:51,247 --> 0:5:6,207
- (Muffled screams)
- CALM! CALM!


87
0:5:6,207 --> 0:5:18,127
It can't be done,
I can't clean the shop in time.


88
0:5:18,127 --> 0:5:22,767
Manny, I'm about to pass on a secret
known only to women and gay men.


89
0:5:22,767 --> 0:5:24,807
You don't have to clean everything.


90
0:5:24,807 --> 0:5:29,727
You can cover stuff with an Indian throw.


91
0:5:29,727 --> 0:5:32,327
Haja-shazam!


92
0:5:32,327 --> 0:5:34,527
Brilliant. Right...


93
0:5:34,527 --> 0:5:36,447
Haja...


94
0:5:36,447 --> 0:5:39,927
haja-whooja!


95
0:5:39,927 --> 0:5:43,527
(Muttering) Haja... haja... haja...


96
0:5:43,527 --> 0:5:47,567
Down! Down!


97
0:5:47,567 --> 0:5:49,727
You will be nice, won't you, Bernard?


98
0:5:49,727 --> 0:5:51,927
(Hollow cracking)


99
0:5:51,927 --> 0:5:55,847
- Quit that!
- Sorry. My mum does that.


100
0:5:55,847 --> 0:6:0,207
# Pardon me, boy
Is that the Chattanooga choo-choo?


101
0:6:0,207 --> 0:6:3,87
# Track twenty-nine
Won't you give me... #


102
0:6:3,87 --> 0:6:5,127
Stop singing.


103
0:6:5,127 --> 0:6:8,167
Sorry. My... My dad does that.


104
0:6:8,167 --> 0:6:12,167
Everything's fine, Manny.
You're all ready.


105
0:6:12,167 --> 0:6:15,7
- Did you wash behind your ears?
- Yeah.


106
0:6:15,7 --> 0:6:17,527
- No!
- I'm joking.


107
0:6:17,527 --> 0:6:21,927
Oh. Oh, I'm not ready, I'll never be ready.
What time is it?


108
0:6:21,927 --> 0:6:25,7
5:46.


109
0:6:25,7 --> 0:6:27,47
(Both) Manny!


110
0:6:27,47 --> 0:6:31,647
Moo-Ma! Moo-Pa!


111
0:6:31,647 --> 0:6:33,567
Mwah! Mwah!


112
0:6:33,567 --> 0:6:35,7
Ah-ha-haa!


113
0:6:35,7 --> 0:6:37,47
Oh-ho-ho. Ah...


114
0:6:37,47 --> 0:6:40,887
Ha-ha-ha.


115
0:6:40,887 --> 0:6:42,927
(Gibbers)


116
0:6:42,927 --> 0:6:45,407
Th-th-the traffic? Was it all right?


117
0:6:45,407 --> 0:6:47,447
- Mmm!
- You had a good journey?


118
0:6:47,447 --> 0:6:50,127
- Yes.
- Good. And was it a pleasant trip?


119
0:6:50,127 --> 0:6:52,167
Good, good, good, good.


120
0:6:52,167 --> 0:6:54,407
- So are you... are you well?
- Yes.


121
0:6:54,407 --> 0:6:57,727
- Easy.
- Easy! Easy! Well...


122
0:6:57,727 --> 0:7:0,447
I expect you'll want to beat the traffic.


123
0:7:0,447 --> 0:7:22,447
It's been lovely. Thank you very much
for coming. See you soon! Bye!


124
0:7:22,447 --> 0:7:25,887
- Well, this is nice.
- Very nice.


125
0:7:25,887 --> 0:7:28,207
(Hollow cracking)


126
0:7:28,207 --> 0:7:30,887
# Pardon me, boy


127
0:7:30,887 --> 0:7:34,167
# Is that the Chattanooga choo-choo?


128
0:7:34,167 --> 0:7:37,247
# Track twenty-nine
Woo... #


129
0:7:37,247 --> 0:7:39,967
(Bernard grunts tunelessly)


130
0:7:39,967 --> 0:7:43,567
It's so nice to meet you at last, Fran.


131
0:7:43,567 --> 0:7:53,87
Yes. You too.


132
0:7:53,87 --> 0:7:57,487
The shop's, erm,
still called Black Books, I see.


133
0:7:57,487 --> 0:8:0,447
Yeah. I was gonna call it World Of Tights


134
0:8:0,447 --> 0:8:4,447
but you have to
spell everything out to people.


135
0:8:4,447 --> 0:8:9,207
Manny mentioned
you were making him a partner.


136
0:8:9,207 --> 0:8:13,447
So I thought it might be
Black & Bianco Books.


137
0:8:13,447 --> 0:8:20,127
- Or Bianco & Black Books.
- Yes. That has a nice ring.


138
0:8:20,127 --> 0:8:22,167
# Pardon me, boy


139
0:8:22,167 --> 0:8:25,527
# Is that the... Chattanooga choo-choo #


140
0:8:25,527 --> 0:8:32,87
(Grinding crunch)


141
0:8:32,87 --> 0:8:34,767
- Why don't I show you to your room?
- Ah.


142
0:8:34,767 --> 0:8:38,887
You'll probably want to relax,
refresh yourselves before we go out.


143
0:8:38,887 --> 0:8:43,927
You're in my room. It's just at the top
of the stairs. I'll be on the old sofa.


144
0:8:43,927 --> 0:8:47,327
So, er, if you need anything,
just shout out,


145
0:8:47,327 --> 0:8:49,647
"Manny-Moo!"


146
0:8:49,647 --> 0:8:52,767
- (Crunching)
- Ah. Well...


147
0:8:52,767 --> 0:8:54,807
seemed to go quite well.


148
0:8:54,807 --> 0:9:0,127
(Bernard laughing)


149
0:9:0,127 --> 0:9:10,527
(Squeaking)


150
0:9:10,527 --> 0:9:12,567
Would you like to explain


151
0:9:12,567 --> 0:9:15,7
before I turn you into a moo-CORPSE?


152
0:9:15,7 --> 0:9:19,727
Well, when I write them a letter,
I do tend to put a bit of a gloss on things.


153
0:9:19,727 --> 0:9:23,247
Anything else we should know?


154
0:9:23,247 --> 0:9:26,567
They kept asking me
whether I was seeing anyone.


155
0:9:26,567 --> 0:9:29,407
And I did say - and this is a bit of a fib -


156
0:9:29,407 --> 0:9:31,447
that I had a girlfriend.


157
0:9:31,447 --> 0:9:33,487
(Fran) Mmm.


158
0:9:33,487 --> 0:9:36,327
What's she like, then?


159
0:9:36,327 --> 0:9:40,47
Well, she's about... medium height,


160
0:9:40,47 --> 0:9:41,847
dark hair,


161
0:9:41,847 --> 0:9:43,967
named Fran.


162
0:9:43,967 --> 0:9:46,447
Look, I just want them to be happy.


163
0:9:46,447 --> 0:9:49,927
Just touch me on the knee
now and again till Sunday.


164
0:9:49,927 --> 0:9:52,327
OK. But there won't be any kissing.


165
0:9:52,327 --> 0:9:54,367
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no.


166
0:9:54,367 --> 0:9:58,447
Ho-ho-hooo, no, no, no, no, no.
No, no, no.


167
0:9:58,447 --> 0:10:8,967
Although, er...


168
0:10:8,967 --> 0:10:12,527
I rather fancy the tagliatelle
with whole baby squid.


169
0:10:12,527 --> 0:10:14,767
- That sounds delicious.
- Oh, yeah.


170
0:10:14,767 --> 0:10:18,327
- Only £17.50.
- (Manny) Jesus.


171
0:10:18,327 --> 0:10:20,447
I mean, erm, I heard once


172
0:10:20,447 --> 0:10:24,407
that squid can sometimes survive
the cooking process


173
0:10:24,407 --> 0:10:29,887
and wake up in your stomach
and strangle your heart.


174
0:10:29,887 --> 0:10:32,167
Maybe not the squid.


175
0:10:32,167 --> 0:10:36,207
No, the garden salad here is amazing.
That's what we should have.


176
0:10:36,207 --> 0:10:41,847
- Excellent.
- Oh, well, righto, then.


177
0:10:41,847 --> 0:10:45,47
Where's the wine list?


178
0:10:45,47 --> 0:10:46,847
Here.


179
0:10:46,847 --> 0:10:51,247
They've got some rather cheeky Lafites
for under a hundred quid.


180
0:10:51,247 --> 0:10:54,647
What about the pinot ninor ninor?


181
0:10:54,647 --> 0:10:57,927
£2.85.


182
0:10:57,927 --> 0:10:59,967
Well, this is lovely.


183
0:10:59,967 --> 0:11:5,167
Yes. Reminds me of the first time I went
to an Italian restaurant. 1965, I think.


184
0:11:5,167 --> 0:11:8,207
I went in, and you know,
the first thing I saw...


185
0:11:8,207 --> 0:11:10,7
Maybe it was 1964.


186
0:11:10,7 --> 0:11:13,927
Couldn't have been 1963
because I couldn't drive then.


187
0:11:13,927 --> 0:11:16,847
I don't think I had
the Hillman at that time.


188
0:11:16,847 --> 0:11:21,167
Yes, I bought the Hillman in 1966,
the year of the World Cup.


189
0:11:21,167 --> 0:11:23,207
I bought it at an auction.


190
0:11:23,207 --> 0:11:25,567
There was this fascinating chap there...


191
0:11:25,567 --> 0:11:29,767
Oh dear, I've dropped my fork!
Excuse me, I'd better get that.


192
0:11:29,767 --> 0:11:42,167
(# Quiet piano music)


193
0:11:42,167 --> 0:11:44,287
Give me a martini, will you?


194
0:11:44,287 --> 0:11:48,567
He worked for Sir Leonard Hutton,
the great Yorkshire cricketer...


195
0:11:48,567 --> 0:11:54,287
- (Fork clatters)
- Whoops, butter fingers!


196
0:11:54,287 --> 0:11:57,447
Bernard, don't be like this. Help him out.


197
0:11:57,447 --> 0:11:59,847
It's just till Sunday.


198
0:11:59,847 --> 0:12:7,7
Come on.


199
0:12:7,7 --> 0:12:9,327
Yes, it was definitely 1963.


200
0:12:9,327 --> 0:12:11,167
Or two.


201
0:12:11,167 --> 0:12:12,767
# Pardon me, boy


202
0:12:12,767 --> 0:12:15,607
# Is that the Chattanooga choo-choo?


203
0:12:15,607 --> 0:12:19,367
- # Track twenty-nine... #
- People leave it too late these days,


204
0:12:19,367 --> 0:12:22,527
- and I don't think that's wise.
- Leave what late?


205
0:12:22,527 --> 0:12:24,607
Babies.


206
0:12:24,607 --> 0:12:26,927
Why are you mentioning babies?


207
0:12:26,927 --> 0:12:33,7
Who else do you give a choo-choo too?


208
0:12:33,7 --> 0:12:38,767
- (Fork clatters)
- Oops!


209
0:12:38,767 --> 0:12:44,887
Give me a daiquiri.


210
0:12:44,887 --> 0:12:47,327
I am not going back up.


211
0:12:47,327 --> 0:12:51,7
I'm going to stay here forever
and live on broken bread sticks.


212
0:12:51,7 --> 0:12:53,527
Come on.


213
0:12:53,527 --> 0:13:11,487
It's fun, fun, fun!


214
0:13:11,487 --> 0:13:13,527
- Wine, please.
- Lots of wine.


215
0:13:13,527 --> 0:13:22,487
- Expensive wine. Wine.
- Wine from the bottom of the list. Wine!


216
0:13:22,487 --> 0:13:25,807
- Are you sure, Manny?
- The bill was rather a lot.


217
0:13:25,807 --> 0:13:31,367
Would you like us to pay for some of it?


218
0:13:31,367 --> 0:13:33,407
No, I couldn't let you do that.


219
0:13:33,407 --> 0:13:35,527
He's quite the Mr Moneybags now.


220
0:13:35,527 --> 0:13:38,887
- Yes, I... It's the least I could do.
- Well, thank you.


221
0:13:38,887 --> 0:13:42,47
Well, boys, shall we leave
the ladies to it?


222
0:13:42,47 --> 0:13:45,287
- To what?
- I'm sure you've got a lot to talk about.


223
0:13:45,287 --> 0:13:48,207
We'll just settle in next door
with a brandy.


224
0:13:48,207 --> 0:13:50,247
Oh. Ha-ha.


225
0:13:50,247 --> 0:13:53,927
I thought you were serious for a minute.


226
0:13:53,927 --> 0:14:3,127
This is the good stuff, Manny.
Come on! Ha!


227
0:14:3,127 --> 0:14:11,127
Have fun.


228
0:14:11,127 --> 0:14:14,727
I spent most of my time
working for the big companies.


229
0:14:14,727 --> 0:14:18,727
But I did dabble
at being an entrepreneur, like you two.


230
0:14:18,727 --> 0:14:20,847
Remember, Manny? 1972, it was.


231
0:14:20,847 --> 0:14:24,7
I got back from that conference and...


232
0:14:24,7 --> 0:14:26,87
No, 1973, it must have been.


233
0:14:26,87 --> 0:14:29,47
Er, we weren't in the bungalow any more.


234
0:14:29,47 --> 0:14:31,887
We moved into the semi.
Or was it the gatehouse?


235
0:14:31,887 --> 0:14:33,767
No, I think it was the semi.


236
0:14:33,767 --> 0:14:38,327
More details. What time of year?
What jumper did you wear?


237
0:14:38,327 --> 0:14:40,487
Of course, I went under in '76.


238
0:14:40,487 --> 0:14:43,487
AH! That's when we moved
into the semi. Yes.


239
0:14:43,487 --> 0:14:49,287
Oh. But I'm so proud of you, Manny. You
want your children to do better than you.


240
0:14:49,287 --> 0:14:54,287
Not to... Not to work for somebody else
but to be in control!


241
0:14:54,287 --> 0:14:59,927
To Manny and his immense success.


242
0:14:59,927 --> 0:15:1,527
So...


243
0:15:1,527 --> 0:15:4,847
Manny's good to you, is he?


244
0:15:4,847 --> 0:15:8,607
Yes, he's a wonderful friend.


245
0:15:8,607 --> 0:15:10,847
Oh. Yes, I see.


246
0:15:10,847 --> 0:15:15,687
And lover, obviously.


247
0:15:15,687 --> 0:15:18,847
It's a bit strange to talk to you about it.


248
0:15:18,847 --> 0:15:21,367
Well, I was young once.


249
0:15:21,367 --> 0:15:33,287
Oh, well, the sex is unbelievable,
he's a beast.


250
0:15:33,287 --> 0:15:35,687
Course, when you're running the show,


251
0:15:35,687 --> 0:15:38,767
sometimes you've got to be
a bit of a bastard!


252
0:15:38,767 --> 0:15:42,47
If you'll excuse my French.
Am I right or am I right?


253
0:15:42,47 --> 0:15:43,807
Yes, Moo-Pa. Yes.


254
0:15:43,807 --> 0:15:47,247
We had a customer one time
and he was shoplifting


255
0:15:47,247 --> 0:15:50,807
and he had the nerve to try
and sell us the books back!


256
0:15:50,807 --> 0:15:53,367
(Laughs) What did you do with him, eh?


257
0:15:53,367 --> 0:15:56,407
I told him, I said, "This... really isn't on."


258
0:15:56,407 --> 0:15:59,607
Oh! I bet those weren't
your exact words, though.


259
0:15:59,607 --> 0:16:2,767
I bet it was more like,
"Do I look like a donkey?


260
0:16:2,767 --> 0:16:5,447
"Think you can take me for a ride? Thief!


261
0:16:5,447 --> 0:16:10,887
"Get out or I'll tear you open
like a bag of crisps."


262
0:16:10,887 --> 0:16:13,447
Oh, now look, you've got him excited.


263
0:16:13,447 --> 0:16:16,487
- Oh, hello, Moo-Ma.
- Time for bed.


264
0:16:16,487 --> 0:16:17,967
Ohhh...


265
0:16:17,967 --> 0:16:22,287
Doesn't your mother look lovely? Eh?


266
0:16:22,287 --> 0:16:26,847
- Right, I'll be off, I'll see you tomorrow.
- Oh, don't leave on our account.


267
0:16:26,847 --> 0:16:30,287
I bet you two would like to snuggle up
on the couch.


268
0:16:30,287 --> 0:16:34,247
- Good night, then.
- Good night.


269
0:16:34,247 --> 0:16:37,487
- (Moo-Ma) How many did you have?
- Oh, two little ones.


270
0:16:37,487 --> 0:16:39,527
Well, six little ones.


271
0:16:39,527 --> 0:16:43,327
- (Door closes)
- My bedroom is next to theirs.


272
0:16:43,327 --> 0:17:1,967
If I hear any nonagenarian hanky-panky,
I'm calling the police.


273
0:17:1,967 --> 0:17:3,647
Hmm... No.


274
0:17:3,647 --> 0:17:6,687
No, I won't go back in the cupboard.


275
0:17:6,687 --> 0:17:10,807
Egh... ooph.


276
0:17:10,807 --> 0:17:17,607
(Man, whispering) Excuse me.


277
0:17:17,607 --> 0:17:20,327
Now you two can just have a lie-in.


278
0:17:20,327 --> 0:17:28,607
Moo-Pa and I get up early so we cleaned
round and opened the shop.


279
0:17:28,607 --> 0:17:31,567
- Where's my dress?
- Oh, it's in the wash.


280
0:17:31,567 --> 0:17:33,647
I put yours and Manny's in together.


281
0:17:33,647 --> 0:17:35,807
(Dry retching)


282
0:17:35,807 --> 0:17:40,287
I had to wash Bernard's separately
because they were a bit dirty.


283
0:17:40,287 --> 0:17:43,607
(Bernard) Who tidied my room?
Who shaved me?


284
0:17:43,607 --> 0:17:47,887
Who washed my clothes?


285
0:17:47,887 --> 0:17:50,87
Morning, Bernard.


286
0:17:50,87 --> 0:17:52,807
Oh, God, you're still alive.


287
0:17:52,807 --> 0:17:57,7
Listen, it's, erm...
Saturday here in London town.


288
0:17:57,7 --> 0:18:1,727
Why don't you nip out and see
a few of the sights, or something.


289
0:18:1,727 --> 0:18:4,607
- London can be very expensive.
- Oh, please.


290
0:18:4,607 --> 0:18:7,207
Here. Go and see
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.


291
0:18:7,207 --> 0:18:9,647
- See it twice.
- We couldn't dream of it.


292
0:18:9,647 --> 0:18:12,327
Do you know
what we'd like to do in London?


293
0:18:12,327 --> 0:18:14,847
Anything. Anything. Please name it.


294
0:18:14,847 --> 0:18:25,727
Just stay right here with all of you.


295
0:18:25,727 --> 0:18:29,87
Oh, here's Manny in the paddling pool.


296
0:18:29,87 --> 0:18:32,767
So much body hair for a seven-year-old.


297
0:18:32,767 --> 0:18:35,847
Remember,
the doctors were always ringing up.


298
0:18:35,847 --> 0:18:41,447
They offered us a lot of money
to show you at the university.


299
0:18:41,447 --> 0:18:44,687
Ooh, mmm. Well, what a day that was.


300
0:18:44,687 --> 0:18:48,7
Absolutely packed
with fun-stuffed memories.


301
0:18:48,7 --> 0:18:50,487
But I'm off to bed now. Thank you.


302
0:18:50,487 --> 0:18:56,847
(Yawns) Me too. I can barely keep my
eyes open. I'll go home and crash. Bye.


303
0:18:56,847 --> 0:18:59,967
- It's one in the afternoon.
- Is it? Oh, Christ.


304
0:18:59,967 --> 0:19:3,87
Oh, and here's Manny on his tricycle.


305
0:19:3,87 --> 0:19:5,447
Oh, that's stuck up in the loft now.


306
0:19:5,447 --> 0:19:8,767
Wouldn't it be lovely
if somebody else could use it.


307
0:19:8,767 --> 0:19:12,807
(Moo-Ma) Wouldn't it be lovely?


308
0:19:12,807 --> 0:19:17,407
# Pardon me, boy
Is that the Chattanooga choo-choo? #


309
0:19:17,407 --> 0:19:21,567
- (Humming melody)
- Manny, can you help us through here?


310
0:19:21,567 --> 0:19:28,927
- Won't take a moment.
- Righto. I'll just...


311
0:19:28,927 --> 0:19:30,967
Oh!


312
0:19:30,967 --> 0:19:34,767
(Choking)


313
0:19:34,767 --> 0:19:36,807
Unless they go in the next hour,


314
0:19:36,807 --> 0:19:40,287
I will tell your mother
I am a psycho-biker-junkie whore.


315
0:19:40,287 --> 0:19:44,327
- It's just for the weekend.
- Not another hour. Not another minute.


316
0:19:44,327 --> 0:19:47,767
I am about to stop playing
"who shall I kill first?"


317
0:19:47,767 --> 0:19:50,127
And just go for what feels natural.


318
0:19:50,127 --> 0:19:54,927
I think I'll start with me, then it's you.


319
0:19:54,927 --> 0:19:58,7
- Make them go.
- (Manny breathing heavily)


320
0:19:58,7 --> 0:20:9,7
(Chokes)


321
0:20:9,7 --> 0:20:10,687
Erm...


322
0:20:10,687 --> 0:20:14,407
it, er... it's a shame
that you won't be able to stay.


323
0:20:14,407 --> 0:20:18,367
- Isn't it?
- Yes, especially as we don't need to go.


324
0:20:18,367 --> 0:20:20,927
We don't need to go till Wednesday.


325
0:20:20,927 --> 0:20:24,607
Oh. I'm sorry,
that sounds like we're imposing.


326
0:20:24,607 --> 0:20:26,647
Oh. No. Erm, no.


327
0:20:26,647 --> 0:20:31,287
Would... Would you... Would you like
to... to stay till... till Wednesday?


328
0:20:31,287 --> 0:20:33,927
- If it's no trouble.
- Wonderful.


329
0:20:33,927 --> 0:20:36,847
(Giggling) Yes!


330
0:20:36,847 --> 0:20:43,7
(Squeaking) Yeah. I'll just...


331
0:20:43,7 --> 0:20:45,47
- And?
- Erm...


332
0:20:45,47 --> 0:20:48,367
- Well, the thing is...
- Yes?


333
0:20:48,367 --> 0:20:51,327
They've gone!


334
0:20:51,327 --> 0:20:54,407
Er, I told them to go... and they went.


335
0:20:54,407 --> 0:20:58,47
(Both sigh)


336
0:20:58,47 --> 0:21:1,927
Oh, I feel a bit bad now.
Still, it's too late to change it.


337
0:21:1,927 --> 0:21:4,967
Well! If I'm going to be here
till Wednesday,


338
0:21:4,967 --> 0:21:8,207
I can get cracking on this sink!


339
0:21:8,207 --> 0:21:10,247
I think I'll need my multi-tool.


340
0:21:10,247 --> 0:21:19,607
Have you got a multi-tool, Bernard?
Couldn't live without mine.


341
0:21:19,607 --> 0:21:23,647
How long did you think
that was going to last, Manny?


342
0:21:23,647 --> 0:21:28,487
I was hoping for about five minutes.


343
0:21:28,487 --> 0:21:39,567
- Ah!
- (Slap)


344
0:21:39,567 --> 0:21:42,527
Moo-Ma, Moo-Pa.


345
0:21:42,527 --> 0:21:46,767
The thing is, I haven't been
completely straight with you.


346
0:21:46,767 --> 0:21:50,887
See... I'm not a partner in the company.


347
0:21:50,887 --> 0:21:52,847
And... Fran...


348
0:21:52,847 --> 0:21:55,127
isn't my girlfriend.


349
0:21:55,127 --> 0:21:57,767
I'm just a bloke that works in a bookshop


350
0:21:57,767 --> 0:22:3,327
and spends his evenings eating cereal.


351
0:22:3,327 --> 0:22:6,967
And I know you'll be angry with me
and you'll want to go.


352
0:22:6,967 --> 0:22:12,167
Oh, Manny, you don't have
to invent things to make us happy.


353
0:22:12,167 --> 0:22:15,767
- We love you whatever you do.
- Well...


354
0:22:15,767 --> 0:22:18,807
Erm, bearing that in mind,


355
0:22:18,807 --> 0:22:20,847
could you go now, please?


356
0:22:20,847 --> 0:22:31,87
We are terribly busy.


357
0:22:31,87 --> 0:22:33,407
Sorry. That's just how it is.


358
0:22:33,407 --> 0:22:35,847
Well, I'm sorry to hear that, Manny.


359
0:22:35,847 --> 0:22:39,647
- We'd better head off, then.
- We wouldn't want to be a burden.


360
0:22:39,647 --> 0:22:41,687
Especially not to you.


361
0:22:41,687 --> 0:22:47,207
Your mother was busy raising you
when she gave up her job.


362
0:22:47,207 --> 0:22:50,7
They wouldn't take her back, you know.


363
0:22:50,7 --> 0:22:52,407
(Moo-Ma) Come along, darling.


364
0:22:52,407 --> 0:22:55,7
- Manny's busy.
- Mm.


365
0:22:55,7 --> 0:22:58,47
No, no. We all need a proper chance
to catch up.


366
0:22:58,47 --> 0:23:2,87
It's too difficult here in London.
Why don't I come up to you?


367
0:23:2,87 --> 0:23:5,527
- I could have a holiday, couldn't I?
- Sure. Take the week.


368
0:23:5,527 --> 0:23:7,167
Well, it's a deal, then.


369
0:23:7,167 --> 0:23:11,47
Auntie Nora will be there.
And Auntie Dora, of course.


370
0:23:11,47 --> 0:23:13,367
- See you then, darling.
- Bye, Moo-Ma.


371
0:23:13,367 --> 0:23:17,127
- Ha-ha-ha-haaa!
- Bye. Ha.


372
0:23:17,127 --> 0:23:21,687
(Manny) Bye.


373
0:23:21,687 --> 0:23:23,807
(Sighs)


374
0:23:23,807 --> 0:23:26,207
Well, they're gone.


375
0:23:26,207 --> 0:23:27,687
OK?


376
0:23:27,687 --> 0:23:31,887
Yeah.


377
0:23:31,887 --> 0:23:36,247
Just imagine, you'll get a whole week
with them, all to yourself.


378
0:23:36,247 --> 0:23:41,527
Heh-heh.


379
0:23:41,527 --> 0:23:44,567
- (Manny) Noooo!
- (Fingers cracking)


380
0:23:44,567 --> 0:23:50,647
- (# Both hum Chattanooga Choo-Choo)
- A week! A week! What have I done?


381
0:23:50,647 --> 0:23:53,7
- (Moaning)
- # Pardon me, boy


382
0:23:53,7 --> 0:23:59,0
# Is that the Chattanooga choo-choo #


383
0:23:59,0 --> 0:25:59,0
