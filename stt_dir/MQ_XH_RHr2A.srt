1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:15,904



2
0:0:15,904 --> 0:0:19,48
MALE SPEAKER: Once you do it,
you feel that adrenaline rush,


3
0:0:19,48 --> 0:0:22,47
and you're on it
until the end.


4
0:0:22,47 --> 0:0:26,5
And you see it put to bed, and
do some of the mop up, get it


5
0:0:26,5 --> 0:0:28,56
cleaned up and rehab.


6
0:0:28,56 --> 0:0:33,58
Once you get a season of that,
it's in your blood, and


7
0:0:33,58 --> 0:0:34,83
there's nothing else.


8
0:0:34,83 --> 0:0:48,88



9
0:0:48,88 --> 0:0:50,36
MALE SPEAKER: While the rest of
the country is flipping its


10
0:0:50,36 --> 0:0:53,86
lid over cyber crime, illegal
aliens, and mutagenic fuel


11
0:0:53,86 --> 0:0:56,79
gases, the Pacific Northwest
still spends its summers


12
0:0:56,79 --> 0:1:1,7
struggling with mankinds first
and oldest enemy, fire, In the


13
0:1:1,7 --> 0:1:4,2
last decade, hundreds of
thousands of forest fires have


14
0:1:4,2 --> 0:1:8,71
scorched 5.5 million acres
of American land.


15
0:1:8,71 --> 0:1:11,98
The average Oregon summer sees
561 wildfires damage 16,000


16
0:1:11,98 --> 0:1:15,81
acres of often pristine forest,
causing mind boggling


17
0:1:15,81 --> 0:1:18,72
damage and devastation.


18
0:1:18,72 --> 0:1:20,606
Last month we travel to Medford,
Oregon to team up


19
0:1:20,606 --> 0:1:24,43
with a firefighting crew
from Grayback Forestry.


20
0:1:24,43 --> 0:1:27,3
Their job is to amble right up
to a roaring blaze and dig a


21
0:1:27,3 --> 0:1:30,5
line around it, to choke
the fire to death.


22
0:1:30,5 --> 0:1:32,86
When there isn't a fire going,
they cut back and relax by


23
0:1:32,86 --> 0:1:35,63
walking up the side of a 45
degree cliff and clearing out


24
0:1:35,63 --> 0:1:38,872
old underbrush, which provides
fuel for these fires.


25
0:1:38,872 --> 0:1:40,35
They're easily the
hardest working


26
0:1:40,35 --> 0:1:41,6
people in tree business.


27
0:1:41,6 --> 0:1:53,23



28
0:1:53,23 --> 0:1:54,65
THOMAS: Hey, it's Thomas.


29
0:1:54,65 --> 0:1:57,27
It's five in the morning
or something.


30
0:1:57,27 --> 0:2:0,0
We're in Oregon, in
a parking lot.


31
0:2:0,0 --> 0:2:5,65
We're about to go into the
forest and tear down trees so


32
0:2:5,65 --> 0:2:8,57
that other trees don't
catch fire.


33
0:2:8,57 --> 0:2:9,3
The checkerboard.


34
0:2:9,3 --> 0:2:9,95
MALE SPEAKER: Motor service,
wilderness.


35
0:2:9,95 --> 0:2:13,18
White is private, and the
yellow is [INAUDIBLE].


36
0:2:13,18 --> 0:2:15,325
SHANE STANCLIFF: Today the unit
we're on now is in Rogue


37
0:2:15,325 --> 0:2:17,94
River, which is a
45 minute drive.


38
0:2:17,94 --> 0:2:21,97
It changes every different unit
usually every week, or


39
0:2:21,97 --> 0:2:22,66
every other week.


40
0:2:22,66 --> 0:2:24,74
Now you've got to grab oil and
stuff for the chainsaws.


41
0:2:24,74 --> 0:2:49,88
THOMAS: Yeah


42
0:2:49,88 --> 0:2:55,12
We've got to file into this
giant box on the back of a


43
0:2:55,12 --> 0:2:57,833
pickup that they call
a [INAUDIBLE].


44
0:2:57,833 --> 0:2:59,93
I'm guessing for good reason.


45
0:2:59,93 --> 0:3:1,905
It feels dumb, I mean these guys
get up every morning at


46
0:3:1,905 --> 0:3:5,315
this hour, but I feel like
physically shaken.


47
0:3:5,315 --> 0:3:8,51
Just not used to 5 o'clock.


48
0:3:8,51 --> 0:3:10,77
It's probably a healthier
way of doing things.


49
0:3:10,77 --> 0:3:14,73
All right, I guess we've got
to get in truck right now.


50
0:3:14,73 --> 0:3:18,69
Somewhere around 5:30, 5:45,
we'll load up the trucks that


51
0:3:18,69 --> 0:3:20,57
we're taking out to the unit.


52
0:3:20,57 --> 0:3:22,39
Get everything ready, make sure
the tools are in there,


53
0:3:22,39 --> 0:3:24,6
make sure we got enough
fuel, and bio oil.


54
0:3:24,6 --> 0:3:26,66



55
0:3:26,66 --> 0:3:27,32
Then we'll all head out.


56
0:3:27,32 --> 0:3:30,47
About 6 o'clock we leave the
shop, and depending on how


57
0:3:30,47 --> 0:3:34,41
far, usually a half hour
to an hour it takes us


58
0:3:34,41 --> 0:3:35,57
to get to the unit.


59
0:3:35,57 --> 0:3:36,51
CRAIG FRANSISCO: You really
get to know the


60
0:3:36,51 --> 0:3:37,97
guys you work with.


61
0:3:37,97 --> 0:3:40,5
Everyone's about the same age,
and has the same interests.


62
0:3:40,5 --> 0:3:43,705
I mean, we're working outside,
so everyone loves the hiking.


63
0:3:43,705 --> 0:3:46,57
If they're not into mountain
biking, they're into like ATV


64
0:3:46,57 --> 0:3:47,43
riding, or dirt biking.


65
0:3:47,43 --> 0:3:49,37
Everyone fishes,
likes camping.


66
0:3:49,37 --> 0:3:51,77
So it's easy to get along with
everyone, everyone's down to


67
0:3:51,77 --> 0:3:55,47
earth and has the
same interests.


68
0:3:55,47 --> 0:3:59,95
Our oxygen tank is usually
handkerchief over us.


69
0:3:59,95 --> 0:4:2,82
And if you're smart about it and
the smoke's going at you,


70
0:4:2,82 --> 0:4:4,867
you just kind of step aside for
a minute and let it pass


71
0:4:4,867 --> 0:4:7,37
as the wind shifts if you can.


72
0:4:7,37 --> 0:4:9,39
It's kind of rough.


73
0:4:9,39 --> 0:4:11,96
Like I said, last year
was my first season.


74
0:4:11,96 --> 0:4:14,1
I didn't really have
a long period away.


75
0:4:14,1 --> 0:4:17,839
But it's like you're gone, you
miss your family, and your


76
0:4:17,839 --> 0:4:20,67
wife misses you and
wants you home.


77
0:4:20,67 --> 0:4:25,53
We did a fire here in town,
in Roxy Ann's mountain.


78
0:4:25,53 --> 0:4:27,825
Probably a two day night shift
is what I did, and


79
0:4:27,825 --> 0:4:28,8
then that was out.


80
0:4:28,8 --> 0:4:31,1
Before we come into something
like this,


81
0:4:31,1 --> 0:4:32,36
we'll have a briefing.


82
0:4:32,36 --> 0:4:37,37
And whoever's like the incident
commander of the fire


83
0:4:37,37 --> 0:4:40,63
at the time will kind of tell
us what to expect, what to


84
0:4:40,63 --> 0:4:41,39
look out for.


85
0:4:41,39 --> 0:4:43,46
We don't just show up and
just like start running


86
0:4:43,46 --> 0:4:44,38
at it with our tools.


87
0:4:44,38 --> 0:4:45,73
Here's a fire, let's
put it out.


88
0:4:45,73 --> 0:4:47,34
They usually have a
pretty good plan.


89
0:4:47,34 --> 0:4:51,77



90
0:4:51,77 --> 0:4:54,12
Usually we'll do the bucket
drops with the helicopters.


91
0:4:54,12 --> 0:4:57,5
Dropping water on them, dropping
retardant on them to


92
0:4:57,5 --> 0:5:0,17
slow it down when it
gets [INAUDIBLE].


93
0:5:0,17 --> 0:5:6,2
It's a real kind of slimy, slick
kind of wet material


94
0:5:6,2 --> 0:5:7,61
that they'll drop and it
gets everything red.


95
0:5:7,61 --> 0:5:10,78
So once the flame does get to
it, it slows it down enough to


96
0:5:10,78 --> 0:5:13,2
let us work a little bit
more in this area.


97
0:5:13,2 --> 0:5:15,333
And finally once you get the
line dug around it, you'll get


98
0:5:15,333 --> 0:5:17,52
the hose down there and you
start the perimeter.


99
0:5:17,52 --> 0:5:21,78
Like we're here on the line, and
the fire was right here.


100
0:5:21,78 --> 0:5:23,13
If they had the water,
it slows it down.


101
0:5:23,13 --> 0:5:26,27
We'll just start in 10 feet,
and we'll scrape everything


102
0:5:26,27 --> 0:5:27,32
hot back in.


103
0:5:27,32 --> 0:5:28,62
We'll spread the pieces out,


104
0:5:28,62 --> 0:5:29,86
extinguish the flames ourselves.


105
0:5:29,86 --> 0:5:33,36
That's like basically our job is
to get what we can with the


106
0:5:33,36 --> 0:5:37,19
tools and make the
fire go out.


107
0:5:37,19 --> 0:5:40,58
Things will grow back, and if
you guys were here a few


108
0:5:40,58 --> 0:5:42,36
months earlier this would've
been green.


109
0:5:42,36 --> 0:5:46,0



110
0:5:46,0 --> 0:5:49,611
Over time there'll be
some new trees.


111
0:5:49,611 --> 0:5:52,52
Don't know if you're allergic
or not, okay, there's an Epi


112
0:5:52,52 --> 0:5:56,14
Kit on the dash my truck
with the hazmat.


113
0:5:56,14 --> 0:6:0,6
So if you get stung let me know
and I'll let you jack


114
0:6:0,6 --> 0:6:1,31
yourself up.


115
0:6:1,31 --> 0:6:3,67



116
0:6:3,67 --> 0:6:5,91
THOMAS: So we basically just
walked to the job site and


117
0:6:5,91 --> 0:6:8,59
we're all already beat.


118
0:6:8,59 --> 0:6:10,46
It's a lot more vertical
than I'm used to


119
0:6:10,46 --> 0:6:12,3
things being this early.


120
0:6:12,3 --> 0:6:14,145
Our camera guy puked.


121
0:6:14,145 --> 0:6:16,97
I'm actually kind of jealous of
him, because I've still got


122
0:6:16,97 --> 0:6:19,72
the full night's pizza sitting
on my stomach.


123
0:6:19,72 --> 0:6:22,3



124
0:6:22,3 --> 0:6:25,14
The tree dust is playing
hell with my sinuses.


125
0:6:25,14 --> 0:6:26,96
JESSE KIENE: See I just imagine
the fire moving


126
0:6:26,96 --> 0:6:31,33
uphill, gets into this brush and
then you have your lower,


127
0:6:31,33 --> 0:6:34,62
your smaller mid-canopy, and
then it just carries in the


128
0:6:34,62 --> 0:6:36,2
large trees.


129
0:6:36,2 --> 0:6:38,88
So what the cutters are doing is
they're coming up below us


130
0:6:38,88 --> 0:6:42,815
here, working up the hill, and
they're taking pretty much the


131
0:6:42,815 --> 0:6:44,39
smaller trees.


132
0:6:44,39 --> 0:6:46,65
Keeping it to a spacing
so they're not just


133
0:6:46,65 --> 0:6:48,19
clearing the forest.


134
0:6:48,19 --> 0:6:53,4
We're trying to manually
recreate what a fire would do.


135
0:6:53,4 --> 0:6:55,86
THOMAS: This is the first time
I've seen Shane kind of sit.


136
0:6:55,86 --> 0:6:59,42
And it's been like an hour and
a half of just straight


137
0:6:59,42 --> 0:7:2,85
walking uphill, with
saw, destroying


138
0:7:2,85 --> 0:7:5,15
trees right and left.


139
0:7:5,15 --> 0:7:6,29
SHANE STANCLIFF: This is easy.


140
0:7:6,29 --> 0:7:10,59
I mean, we get higher up, and
it's like, a lot of rocks and


141
0:7:10,59 --> 0:7:13,4
like the whole ground, you'll
just take one step up and


142
0:7:13,4 --> 0:7:14,49
three steps down.


143
0:7:14,49 --> 0:7:17,5
So it's tough.


144
0:7:17,5 --> 0:7:21,85
THOMAS: I am carrying my body
weight in forestry supplies,


145
0:7:21,85 --> 0:7:27,66
going down to 50 degree incline
to chop down some


146
0:7:27,66 --> 0:7:30,6
shrubs so forest fire doesn't
destroy this.


147
0:7:30,6 --> 0:7:33,26



148
0:7:33,26 --> 0:7:35,195
CRAIG FRANSISCO: That happens
a lot, even with us, dude.


149
0:7:35,195 --> 0:7:39,8



150
0:7:39,8 --> 0:7:45,15
THOMAS: Slowly getting less
enamored of this job.


151
0:7:45,15 --> 0:7:46,14
CRAIG FRANSISCO: Thank you.


152
0:7:46,14 --> 0:7:48,97
Thanks for carrying
it out here.


153
0:7:48,97 --> 0:7:50,69
THOMAS: I really feel kind of
worthless compared to these


154
0:7:50,69 --> 0:7:55,75
guys, but I know if I had like a
chainsaw in hand I'd just be


155
0:7:55,75 --> 0:7:58,4
like getting caught in
tress right and left.


156
0:7:58,4 --> 0:8:2,8
Having the blade just suck down
into everything I touch.


157
0:8:2,8 --> 0:8:4,78
I'm going to leave this
for the real guy.


158
0:8:4,78 --> 0:8:7,91



159
0:8:7,91 --> 0:8:12,0
JAKE ADAMS: I've been doing this
for roughly three years.


160
0:8:12,0 --> 0:8:16,36
I started back in '07,
just moved up here.


161
0:8:16,36 --> 0:8:20,14
I had been teaching for a little
while outside of Reno.


162
0:8:20,14 --> 0:8:23,63
One day I realized that I wasn't
there for the kids, I


163
0:8:23,63 --> 0:8:25,28
was there for a paycheck.


164
0:8:25,28 --> 0:8:27,77
And I always told myself but if
I found myself teaching in


165
0:8:27,77 --> 0:8:30,58
that kind of situation, that I
have no business being there.


166
0:8:30,58 --> 0:8:33,49
I'd always wanted to get
involved with firefighting, so


167
0:8:33,49 --> 0:8:34,94
came on out, thought
I'd give it a shot.


168
0:8:34,94 --> 0:8:36,83
I do enjoy fighting fire.


169
0:8:36,83 --> 0:8:40,57
I love doing that
part of the job.


170
0:8:40,57 --> 0:8:43,83
However, if we can mitigate them
before it comes down to


171
0:8:43,83 --> 0:8:46,56
getting to a big point,
then I think we're


172
0:8:46,56 --> 0:8:47,6
better off that way.


173
0:8:47,6 --> 0:8:51,56
But you're with the same guys,
the same 20 people, for 14


174
0:8:51,56 --> 0:8:54,45
days, possibly even
21 days at a time.


175
0:8:54,45 --> 0:9:0,29
And if you have thin skin, and
you can't take a joke, then


176
0:9:0,29 --> 0:9:3,1
you're going to have trouble.


177
0:9:3,1 --> 0:9:6,5
But yeah, so everyone really
tries, and I think especially


178
0:9:6,5 --> 0:9:8,98
nowadays we've been able to
really nice and lighthearted


179
0:9:8,98 --> 0:9:12,18
while staying safe out in the
woods and it's been great.


180
0:9:12,18 --> 0:9:14,49
And I'm loving it right now.


181
0:9:14,49 --> 0:9:16,755
It's cheaper than a
gym membership.


182
0:9:16,755 --> 0:9:21,55



183
0:9:21,55 --> 0:9:22,8
THOMAS: Feels brisk.


184
0:9:22,8 --> 0:9:28,67



185
0:9:28,67 --> 0:9:30,725
At least I chose today
to wear probably the


186
0:9:30,725 --> 0:9:31,975
gayest underwear I own.


187
0:9:31,975 --> 0:9:34,67



188
0:9:34,67 --> 0:9:36,4
MALE SPEAKER: Is your
belt strapped?


189
0:9:36,4 --> 0:9:38,61
THOMAS: OK.


190
0:9:38,61 --> 0:9:39,46
MALE SPEAKER: Now you
want it ride low.


191
0:9:39,46 --> 0:9:39,99
THOMAS: Yeah?


192
0:9:39,99 --> 0:9:42,305
Oh OK.


193
0:9:42,305 --> 0:9:45,73
I'm currently dressed like a
Frosted Mini Wheats version of


194
0:9:45,73 --> 0:9:48,81
a forest firefighter,
and we're going


195
0:9:48,81 --> 0:9:50,9
to go dig some line.


196
0:9:50,9 --> 0:9:53,67
There's not a fire right now,
but it is good practice.


197
0:9:53,67 --> 0:9:57,41
Line is basically a ditch you
surround a fire with and then


198
0:9:57,41 --> 0:10:0,105
it can't get over there.


199
0:10:0,105 --> 0:10:2,79
TIM HENAGIN: You're not trying
to do the whole line by


200
0:10:2,79 --> 0:10:7,82
yourself, you're going to come
along and do this, just a


201
0:10:7,82 --> 0:10:8,42
[INAUDIBLE].


202
0:10:8,42 --> 0:10:11,23
It's pretty much like this, move
a little bit, like that,


203
0:10:11,23 --> 0:10:14,83
move a little bit like that.


204
0:10:14,83 --> 0:10:16,79
MALE SPEAKER: Cutters are the
first one in cutting line.


205
0:10:16,79 --> 0:10:19,62
And then the swampers come,
they clear everything out.


206
0:10:19,62 --> 0:10:21,556
And then the diggers
come behind them


207
0:10:21,556 --> 0:10:23,492
and dig a fire line.


208
0:10:23,492 --> 0:10:29,3



209
0:10:29,3 --> 0:10:31,74
MALE SPEAKER: You're about
two minutes into it.


210
0:10:31,74 --> 0:10:32,37
THOMAS: Yeah?


211
0:10:32,37 --> 0:10:34,47
And you keep doing this
for how long?


212
0:10:34,47 --> 0:10:35,623
MALE SPEAKER: 16 hours
sometimes.


213
0:10:35,623 --> 0:10:36,873
THOMAS: Oh my God.


214
0:10:36,873 --> 0:10:40,215



215
0:10:40,215 --> 0:10:43,19
This is extraordinarily
hard work.


216
0:10:43,19 --> 0:10:46,25
It's impossible to keep my
eye on where I'm hitting


217
0:10:46,25 --> 0:10:47,56
and where I'm going.


218
0:10:47,56 --> 0:10:50,6



219
0:10:50,6 --> 0:10:53,53
And that's with no fire
in front of me.


220
0:10:53,53 --> 0:10:54,97
MALE SPEAKER: In the yoke.


221
0:10:54,97 --> 0:10:58,236



222
0:10:58,236 --> 0:11:1,0
MALE SPEAKER: What
do you think?


223
0:11:1,0 --> 0:11:3,89
THOMAS: That's a
bit laborious.


224
0:11:3,89 --> 0:11:11,15
That's about what like a 50th
of your average shift?


225
0:11:11,15 --> 0:11:11,79
MALE SPEAKER: Oh yeah,
at least, that was


226
0:11:11,79 --> 0:11:16,4
probably six minutes.


227
0:11:16,4 --> 0:11:18,923
THOMAS: How much distance
did we cover?


228
0:11:18,923 --> 0:11:20,47
MALE SPEAKER: A hundred
feet maybe.


229
0:11:20,47 --> 0:11:23,4
Seven hours we'll do
10,000 plus feet.


230
0:11:23,4 --> 0:11:25,3
THOMAS: 100 times that.


231
0:11:25,3 --> 0:11:26,49
MALE SPEAKER: We started getting
it pretty good right


232
0:11:26,49 --> 0:11:28,35
before we quit, we were
spaced out perfect.


233
0:11:28,35 --> 0:11:30,936



234
0:11:30,936 --> 0:11:31,82
MALE SPEAKER: Having fun?


235
0:11:31,82 --> 0:11:31,948
THOMAS: Yeah.


236
0:11:31,948 --> 0:11:33,25
MALE SPEAKER: Not bad
for a rookie, Tom.


237
0:11:33,25 --> 0:11:34,115
THOMAS: Thank you.


238
0:11:34,115 --> 0:11:34,61
Appreciate that.


239
0:11:34,61 --> 0:11:37,85
MALE SPEAKER: We'd take
you on the crew.


240
0:11:37,85 --> 0:11:39,666
THOMAS: That'd be short
lived I think.


241
0:11:39,666 --> 0:11:40,56
[LAUGHTER]


242
0:11:40,56 --> 0:11:42,43
MALE SPEAKER: Oh you'd
be surprised.


243
0:11:42,43 --> 0:11:45,7
I've been working in the
woods all my life.


244
0:11:45,7 --> 0:11:48,17
I started out logging,
it's like coming


245
0:11:48,17 --> 0:11:50,425
full circle for me.


246
0:11:50,425 --> 0:11:54,6
I've cut the trees down, the
big timber, and set the


247
0:11:54,6 --> 0:11:57,19
chokers, hauled them out of the
woods, and done a little


248
0:11:57,19 --> 0:11:59,2
bit of planting.


249
0:11:59,2 --> 0:12:5,21
Now I'm back thinning it out
and help prevent wild fire.


250
0:12:5,21 --> 0:12:10,28
You want to use back here from
here back on your saw.


251
0:12:10,28 --> 0:12:11,1
THOMAS: Never the top.


252
0:12:11,1 --> 0:12:12,85
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah the closer
you get to here when you're


253
0:12:12,85 --> 0:12:16,5
limbing, the more chance
you have a kick back.


254
0:12:16,5 --> 0:12:19,2
And remember you always want to
wrap this thumb around the


255
0:12:19,2 --> 0:12:20,48
handle bar.


256
0:12:20,48 --> 0:12:21,77
Don't cut with it up there like


257
0:12:21,77 --> 0:12:23,1
that, you have no control.


258
0:12:23,1 --> 0:12:25,7
With kickback, this will come
right out of your hand.


259
0:12:25,7 --> 0:12:27,956
When you grab that chainsaw,
you mold on it, it becomes


260
0:12:27,956 --> 0:12:31,29
part of your body.


261
0:12:31,29 --> 0:12:33,91
One of the things that
turn my stomach most


262
0:12:33,91 --> 0:12:36,736
is a chainsaw cut.


263
0:12:36,736 --> 0:12:39,61
It cuts quick and to the bone,
and when it stops those teeth


264
0:12:39,61 --> 0:12:40,86
pull everything out.


265
0:12:40,86 --> 0:12:43,78



266
0:12:43,78 --> 0:12:46,95
And just imagine doing
that all day.


267
0:12:46,95 --> 0:12:49,81
The key to happiness out
here is a sharp chain.


268
0:12:49,81 --> 0:12:56,87



269
0:12:56,87 --> 0:12:59,4
MALE SPEAKER: All right,
now the fun part.


270
0:12:59,4 --> 0:13:4,565
THOMAS: I am sore, and sweaty,
and ant bitten.


271
0:13:4,565 --> 0:13:7,67
I've got sawdust in my mouth.


272
0:13:7,67 --> 0:13:11,31
I've got chips under
my eyelids.


273
0:13:11,31 --> 0:13:15,74
I've got weird vibrationally
numbed


274
0:13:15,74 --> 0:13:18,95
fingers from the chainsaw.


275
0:13:18,95 --> 0:13:20,843
I feel very good about myself,
though, because I've done an


276
0:13:20,843 --> 0:13:22,47
honest day's work.


277
0:13:22,47 --> 0:13:25,13
Helping the forest and keeping
people from having their


278
0:13:25,13 --> 0:13:29,9
houses burn down is a pretty
good way to spend your time.


279
0:13:29,9 --> 0:13:31,15
Also get you in decent shape.


280
0:13:31,15 --> 0:13:40,46



281
0:13:40,46 --> 0:13:44,19
Firefighters around the world
are universally acclaimed, and


282
0:13:44,19 --> 0:13:45,42
considered heroes.


283
0:13:45,42 --> 0:13:47,72
Forest fire fighters, though,
are in the league to


284
0:13:47,72 --> 0:13:49,65
themselves.


285
0:13:49,65 --> 0:13:53,78
They basically go into one of
the deadliest situations in


286
0:13:53,78 --> 0:13:56,87
nature, something that we have
all been instinctively hard


287
0:13:56,87 --> 0:14:3,26
wired to avoid on site or
smell, no matter what.


288
0:14:3,26 --> 0:14:6,37
And get right up against the
flames, and then do one of the


289
0:14:6,37 --> 0:14:9,605
hardest jobs imaginable, which
is digging a ditch.


290
0:14:9,605 --> 0:14:12,63
It's some of the hardest
work I think exists.


291
0:14:12,63 --> 0:16:12,63
