1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:10,94



2
0:0:10,94 --> 0:0:12,19
NICK PERATA: My name's
Nick Perata.


3
0:0:12,19 --> 0:0:15,8



4
0:0:15,8 --> 0:0:18,12
The thing I like to do
most when I'm not


5
0:0:18,12 --> 0:0:21,68
riding steeps is jibbing.


6
0:0:21,68 --> 0:0:24,77
You're riding on everything that
you see in your path--


7
0:0:24,77 --> 0:0:28,58
logs, rocks, small children,
anything.


8
0:0:28,58 --> 0:0:38,5



9
0:0:38,5 --> 0:0:41,13
PIERRE WIKBERG: Jibbing, in a
freaking neon jacket he had,


10
0:0:41,13 --> 0:0:42,53
and was just like, oh,
we're just jibbing.


11
0:0:42,53 --> 0:0:45,16
Dreadlocks, just crazy Frogskins
or something.


12
0:0:45,16 --> 0:0:50,1
It just seemed really innocent
back in the Tahoe days.


13
0:0:50,1 --> 0:0:52,94
That word "jibbing" started,
Nick Perata said it.


14
0:0:52,94 --> 0:0:55,12
DAVE DOWNING: The whole jibbing
thing was going on in


15
0:0:55,12 --> 0:0:57,11
the late '80s.


16
0:0:57,11 --> 0:1:1,2
It was just hitting little trees
or rocks or whatever


17
0:1:1,2 --> 0:1:3,76
that was non-snow obstacles.


18
0:1:3,76 --> 0:1:8,39
It kind of translated into kids
riding hand rails in the


19
0:1:8,39 --> 0:1:10,32
street, or just doing stuff
in the street--


20
0:1:10,32 --> 0:1:11,1
small things.


21
0:1:11,1 --> 0:1:13,87
And then that escalated into
bigger and bigger things, like


22
0:1:13,87 --> 0:1:16,46
Snow Park Technologies and Bear
Mountain and other places


23
0:1:16,46 --> 0:1:19,56
started building specific
things for snowboarding.


24
0:1:19,56 --> 0:1:20,97
And now look at it.


25
0:1:20,97 --> 0:1:21,58
It's pretty crazy.


26
0:1:21,58 --> 0:1:24,755
They're putting stair steps and
kink rails and wall rides


27
0:1:24,755 --> 0:1:26,22
in the snow.


28
0:1:26,22 --> 0:1:28,36
It's pretty cool seeing how
it came to be here.


29
0:1:28,36 --> 0:1:35,88



30
0:1:35,88 --> 0:1:37,53
CHRIS GUNNARSON: I told you we
were bringing it back on a


31
0:1:37,53 --> 0:1:39,346
2011 scale.


32
0:1:39,346 --> 0:1:40,88
CHAD DINENNA: You can't
really compare it to


33
0:1:40,88 --> 0:1:41,726
the previous years.


34
0:1:41,726 --> 0:1:43,97
It's on such a different
scale.


35
0:1:43,97 --> 0:1:47,0
CHRIS GUNNARSON: The last
Jibfest was eight years ago.


36
0:1:47,0 --> 0:1:49,71
And we set the bar so high
with the original Nixon


37
0:1:49,71 --> 0:1:52,38
Jibfest that if we were going
to bring it back eight years


38
0:1:52,38 --> 0:1:55,12
later, it needed to be on
a whole new level of


39
0:1:55,12 --> 0:1:56,51
awesomeness.


40
0:1:56,51 --> 0:1:58,98
CHAD DINENNA: The best part
of it is when all the


41
0:1:58,98 --> 0:2:1,325
snowboarders come up for the
first time, and they see it,


42
0:2:1,325 --> 0:2:3,9
and they start to process it.


43
0:2:3,9 --> 0:2:5,18
That's what it's all about.


44
0:2:5,18 --> 0:2:8,27
It's like going from small
town to the big city.


45
0:2:8,27 --> 0:2:10,169
CHRIS GUNNARSON: Actually,
Jeremy called it Awesome Town.


46
0:2:10,169 --> 0:2:10,835
CHAD DINENNA: Awesome Town.


47
0:2:10,835 --> 0:2:11,78
CHRIS GUNNARSON: Welcome
to Awesome Town.


48
0:2:11,78 --> 0:2:13,3
CHAD DINENNA: Welcome
to Awesome Town.


49
0:2:13,3 --> 0:2:15,54



50
0:2:15,54 --> 0:2:19,59
JEREMY JONES: It's pretty
on point, really.


51
0:2:19,59 --> 0:2:20,7
Dudes are just stoked.


52
0:2:20,7 --> 0:2:23,43
They're stoked to be here, the
kids are stoked to be here.


53
0:2:23,43 --> 0:2:27,71
They just saw all this
when they grew up.


54
0:2:27,71 --> 0:2:29,43
They've all just gotten
bigger, and


55
0:2:29,43 --> 0:2:31,25
so this is the biggest.


56
0:2:31,25 --> 0:2:35,4



57
0:2:35,4 --> 0:2:39,0
It's going to be super fun.


58
0:2:39,0 --> 0:2:41,2
PAT BRIDGES: Throughout the
whole course of snowboarding,


59
0:2:41,2 --> 0:2:43,6
a common thread has always
been skateboarding.


60
0:2:43,6 --> 0:2:48,755



61
0:2:48,755 --> 0:2:51,8
Taking the influence of
skateboarding, because


62
0:2:51,8 --> 0:2:51,92
everybody skates.


63
0:2:51,92 --> 0:2:54,65
Taking that influence and
bringing it to snowboarding.


64
0:2:54,65 --> 0:2:57,365



65
0:2:57,365 --> 0:2:58,75
PIERRE WIKBERG: I think if you
are skateboarding and you're


66
0:2:58,75 --> 0:3:1,21
snowboarding, it's natural
to combine them.


67
0:3:1,21 --> 0:3:3,9
Everyone who skateboards
then rides a snowboard.


68
0:3:3,9 --> 0:3:5,15
It just translates.


69
0:3:5,15 --> 0:3:13,14



70
0:3:13,14 --> 0:3:16,61
PAT BRIDGES: They just started
trying to mimic skateboarding


71
0:3:16,61 --> 0:3:19,3
beyond just how you grabbed
your board or


72
0:3:19,3 --> 0:3:20,78
riding a half pipe.


73
0:3:20,78 --> 0:3:23,77
These guy's took mimicking
skateboarding to all aspects


74
0:3:23,77 --> 0:3:24,97
of snowboarding.


75
0:3:24,97 --> 0:3:26,95
NATE COLE: We were trying to
find hand rails more than


76
0:3:26,95 --> 0:3:29,86
anything at that time when
we first all started.


77
0:3:29,86 --> 0:3:31,82
There was really nothing
else to do, so we'd


78
0:3:31,82 --> 0:3:33,6
snowboard after the days.


79
0:3:33,6 --> 0:3:34,7
No one had a job
hardly at all.


80
0:3:34,7 --> 0:3:35,49
You couldn't skate.


81
0:3:35,49 --> 0:3:37,48
There was no indoor
skateboarding at all.


82
0:3:37,48 --> 0:3:39,76
So you'd find--


83
0:3:39,76 --> 0:3:42,32
if it was snowing enough, you'd
just go find a hand rail


84
0:3:42,32 --> 0:3:42,87
and slide on it.


85
0:3:42,87 --> 0:3:45,43
But then it was limited, of
course, with what you can do


86
0:3:45,43 --> 0:3:47,57
with that, so it'd
be picnic tables.


87
0:3:47,57 --> 0:3:49,12
JAKE BLATTNER: We'd always get
pissed during the holiday


88
0:3:49,12 --> 0:3:50,935
seasons when everyone would come
and they'd be eating on


89
0:3:50,935 --> 0:3:52,5
the picnic tables.


90
0:3:52,5 --> 0:3:55,61
I remember doing [INAUDIBLE]
where [INAUDIBLE] would do


91
0:3:55,61 --> 0:3:57,28
tail slides across the thing
while people were


92
0:3:57,28 --> 0:3:58,93
still eating and stuff.


93
0:3:58,93 --> 0:4:0,81
ROAN ROGERS: We just went nuts
on the hand rail stuff for a


94
0:4:0,81 --> 0:4:3,81
couple years, and then I don't
think we ever really thought


95
0:4:3,81 --> 0:4:7,7
of it as we are starting
something or anything.


96
0:4:7,7 --> 0:4:8,936
We were more or less copying
the skateboarders, you know


97
0:4:8,936 --> 0:4:11,34
what I mean, and trying to
do what they were doing.


98
0:4:11,34 --> 0:4:13,78
NATE COLE: And I was just so
much wanting to skateboard.


99
0:4:13,78 --> 0:4:16,269
Most people were almost more
skateboarders than they were


100
0:4:16,269 --> 0:4:17,1
snowboarders.


101
0:4:17,1 --> 0:4:20,49
They were just wanting to do
that as much as anything, so


102
0:4:20,49 --> 0:4:23,2
couldn't quite get that same
feeling, but you were going


103
0:4:23,2 --> 0:4:23,9
for that always.


104
0:4:23,9 --> 0:4:25,78
You felt like it should
be more like that.


105
0:4:25,78 --> 0:4:28,25
DAVE DOWNING: There was a crew
of dudes that were jibbing


106
0:4:28,25 --> 0:4:30,17
stuff, and then it kind
of faded away.


107
0:4:30,17 --> 0:4:34,81
I don't remember the year, but
it faded away for about five


108
0:4:34,81 --> 0:4:35,63
years, I'd say.


109
0:4:35,63 --> 0:4:40,82
And then, really, the truth is
JP Walker and Jeremy Jones and


110
0:4:40,82 --> 0:4:44,17
their little crew from Utah were
the first ones to really


111
0:4:44,17 --> 0:4:47,45
bring that whole jibbing think
back into the limelight of


112
0:4:47,45 --> 0:4:48,81
snowboarding.


113
0:4:48,81 --> 0:4:51,12
JP WALKER: I always watched
those old videos of those guys


114
0:4:51,12 --> 0:4:53,65
jibbing, and that just
seemed so cool.


115
0:4:53,65 --> 0:4:55,5
And when I started snowboarding,
that's what I


116
0:4:55,5 --> 0:4:55,95
started doing.


117
0:4:55,95 --> 0:5:0,5
So it wasn't like I was
trying to make some


118
0:5:0,5 --> 0:5:1,28
effort or bring it back.


119
0:5:1,28 --> 0:5:3,34
It was just like, I'm just going
to do what I like doing


120
0:5:3,34 --> 0:5:6,71
and have fun doing it.


121
0:5:6,71 --> 0:5:8,77
JEREMY JONES: I had "Hard, the
Hungry, and the Homeless"


122
0:5:8,77 --> 0:5:14,16
soundtrack in my Dotson B210 on
tape that I recorded from


123
0:5:14,16 --> 0:5:18,59
the VCR through the
TV on to a tape.


124
0:5:18,59 --> 0:5:22,37
That was my soundtrack so I'd
hear all the snowboard sounds


125
0:5:22,37 --> 0:5:25,13
and the slides down the rail
driving to the mountain, and


126
0:5:25,13 --> 0:5:26,69
that was it.


127
0:5:26,69 --> 0:5:29,68
Burned the tape out because
that was our scene.


128
0:5:29,68 --> 0:5:43,37



129
0:5:43,37 --> 0:5:45,7
JP WALKER: None of us were never
really into contests at


130
0:5:45,7 --> 0:5:48,3
all, but we'd been doing it.


131
0:5:48,3 --> 0:5:49,93
There'd been all these different
contests happening.


132
0:5:49,93 --> 0:5:51,93
We'd been going to X Games
and doing things.


133
0:5:51,93 --> 0:5:56,3
And someone said the word
"anti-contest." We need to


134
0:5:56,3 --> 0:5:57,76
come up with this
anti-contest.


135
0:5:57,76 --> 0:6:2,23
And that wasn't so much like the
direct motivation behind


136
0:6:2,23 --> 0:6:5,47
the thing, but it was just kind
of like, let's have an


137
0:6:5,47 --> 0:6:9,41
event where only people we
like are at this event.


138
0:6:9,41 --> 0:6:12,69



139
0:6:12,69 --> 0:6:16,13
We'll only invite people from
the media that we like.


140
0:6:16,13 --> 0:6:18,66
There won't be all these
spectators that are just


141
0:6:18,66 --> 0:6:21,34
creating unwanted pressure
and stuff.


142
0:6:21,34 --> 0:6:23,21
It kind of just started
from there.


143
0:6:23,21 --> 0:6:26,2
And then, I think just because
we were so into jibbing at the


144
0:6:26,2 --> 0:6:31,0
time, it was like, well, it's
going to be a jib contest.


145
0:6:31,0 --> 0:6:32,25
CHAD DINENNA: Just a couple
things, you guys.


146
0:6:32,25 --> 0:6:34,51
First of all, I want to thank
everyone for coming.


147
0:6:34,51 --> 0:6:36,45
It's been eight years since we
brought everyone together for


148
0:6:36,45 --> 0:6:37,7
an event like this.


149
0:6:37,7 --> 0:6:41,44
The premise for me is just to
say thanks to the people who


150
0:6:41,44 --> 0:6:44,52
have supported the brand since
the beginning, and to invite


151
0:6:44,52 --> 0:6:46,88
some new people into the mix.


152
0:6:46,88 --> 0:6:49,36
I think one of the fun things
for us is, because as a brand,


153
0:6:49,36 --> 0:6:50,55
as we've grown up--


154
0:6:50,55 --> 0:6:52,77
my background being
in a magazine--


155
0:6:52,77 --> 0:6:55,5
we've really worked hard with
the different media groups to


156
0:6:55,5 --> 0:6:57,5
make it something that you guys
can roll out of here and


157
0:6:57,5 --> 0:6:58,32
get some really good
exposure out of it.


158
0:6:58,32 --> 0:7:2,1
And not only have a good time,
but really reap the rewards of


159
0:7:2,1 --> 0:7:4,15
your hard work and
your fun times.


160
0:7:4,15 --> 0:7:6,68
We try not to have a lot
of rules to this.


161
0:7:6,68 --> 0:7:8,58
This is not a contest.


162
0:7:8,58 --> 0:7:9,88
It's a good time.


163
0:7:9,88 --> 0:7:10,16
-There is a winner, though.


164
0:7:10,16 --> 0:7:10,69
CHAD DINENNA: You're right,


165
0:7:10,69 --> 0:7:11,94
[INAUDIBLE], there is a winner.


166
0:7:11,94 --> 0:7:15,48



167
0:7:15,48 --> 0:7:17,55
But you're the judges.


168
0:7:17,55 --> 0:7:20,57
At the end of the day, on the
last day, we have a pad of


169
0:7:20,57 --> 0:7:21,83
paper, and I'm going to
sit down with you.


170
0:7:21,83 --> 0:7:25,11
And you're going to write down
who you think rode the best--


171
0:7:25,11 --> 0:7:27,98
your top three favorites
and the best trick.


172
0:7:27,98 --> 0:7:30,21
Someone that's going to leave a
lasting impression on you in


173
0:7:30,21 --> 0:7:32,78
the four days, three days that
we're here together.


174
0:7:32,78 --> 0:7:35,89
Part of it, just as much of it
as it is all of us riding


175
0:7:35,89 --> 0:7:38,19
together on the hill, it's
the time that we spend


176
0:7:38,19 --> 0:7:39,73
together like this.


177
0:7:39,73 --> 0:7:41,32
At the end of the day, I just
want you guys to be stoked on


178
0:7:41,32 --> 0:7:42,683
what's here for you,
and I want you all


179
0:7:42,683 --> 0:7:43,334
to have a good time.


180
0:7:43,334 --> 0:7:55,74
[APPLAUSE]


181
0:7:55,74 --> 0:7:58,25
-Just like leg a season out.


182
0:7:58,25 --> 0:8:1,717
We all deal with this and that,
and that's why this


183
0:8:1,717 --> 0:8:4,52
thing is so cool is just
because we can


184
0:8:4,52 --> 0:8:5,8
go up and just shred.


185
0:8:5,8 --> 0:10:5,8
