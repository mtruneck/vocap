1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:18,315



2
0:0:18,315 --> 0:0:22,99
HAYDEN GILLIM: We've had this
track for four or five years


3
0:0:22,99 --> 0:0:25,1
and we've been riding
on it every day.


4
0:0:25,1 --> 0:0:30,241



5
0:0:30,241 --> 0:0:33,97
FRANKIE GILLIM: The good thing
is, now they're all old enough


6
0:0:33,97 --> 0:0:36,71
that they can look over
the littler kids.


7
0:0:36,71 --> 0:0:37,96
So I don't have to sit
up here and babysit.


8
0:0:37,96 --> 0:0:46,85



9
0:0:46,85 --> 0:0:47,49
They crashed a lot.


10
0:0:47,49 --> 0:0:50,68
Now they crash and
it's all funny.


11
0:0:50,68 --> 0:0:51,71
Back then they crashed
and it'd be


12
0:0:51,71 --> 0:0:52,96
like oh, I hurt myself.


13
0:0:52,96 --> 0:0:56,28



14
0:0:56,28 --> 0:0:58,43
My granddad owned this
28 acres here.


15
0:0:58,43 --> 0:1:1,5
That used to be his house down
there, his barn, raised


16
0:1:1,5 --> 0:1:3,928
cattle, worked in tobacco.


17
0:1:3,928 --> 0:1:5,51
KERRI GILLIM: They started
racing when they were about


18
0:1:5,51 --> 0:1:7,67
six and eight and my family
all had raced.


19
0:1:7,67 --> 0:1:10,95
So I raced when I was young,
my uncle's family races, my


20
0:1:10,95 --> 0:1:13,67
dad raced, so we just always
have been around it.


21
0:1:13,67 --> 0:1:18,54



22
0:1:18,54 --> 0:1:19,7
I just want him to have fun.


23
0:1:19,7 --> 0:1:22,8
I try not to think about
the whole if he's going


24
0:1:22,8 --> 0:1:24,28
to make it or not.


25
0:1:24,28 --> 0:1:25,92
Because life's too short.


26
0:1:25,92 --> 0:1:28,51
I want him to experience it,
and I went him to enjoy his


27
0:1:28,51 --> 0:1:31,405
friends and the whole
entire thing.


28
0:1:31,405 --> 0:1:35,88
HAYDEN GILLIM: I crashed
at Indy--


29
0:1:35,88 --> 0:1:38,59
it's pretty beat up.


30
0:1:38,59 --> 0:1:46,12
And I got all the trophies from
last year that I got, and


31
0:1:46,12 --> 0:1:47,88
the Rookie's Cup.


32
0:1:47,88 --> 0:1:51,43
Canteen that my grandpa
gave me that he had


33
0:1:51,43 --> 0:1:53,38
in the Vietnam War.


34
0:1:53,38 --> 0:1:55,89



35
0:1:55,89 --> 0:2:0,85
And then this is a plate
that was in my


36
0:2:0,85 --> 0:2:2,32
collarbone last year.


37
0:2:2,32 --> 0:2:3,31
Right after I broke my


38
0:2:3,31 --> 0:2:6,5
collarbone, I won that weekend.


39
0:2:6,5 --> 0:2:7,96
So it was a good and
bad weekend.


40
0:2:7,96 --> 0:2:10,47



41
0:2:10,47 --> 0:2:16,15
And that t-shirt was
made right after my


42
0:2:16,15 --> 0:2:18,72
little brother died.


43
0:2:18,72 --> 0:2:22,92
It's a picture of three of us
on the podium at the Flat


44
0:2:22,92 --> 0:2:24,79
Track Nationals.


45
0:2:24,79 --> 0:2:27,1
Picture of him holding
his Youth Dirt


46
0:2:27,1 --> 0:2:28,95
Tracker of the Year trophy.


47
0:2:28,95 --> 0:2:31,97
There's a picture of him and
then I'm right there, he's


48
0:2:31,97 --> 0:2:34,43
beating me.


49
0:2:34,43 --> 0:2:36,15
I had to stop wearing
it, couldn't put


50
0:2:36,15 --> 0:2:37,4
it through the washer.


51
0:2:37,4 --> 0:2:44,47



52
0:2:44,47 --> 0:2:47,42
KERRI GILLIM: He was the clown,
the one that scared


53
0:2:47,42 --> 0:2:50,4
everybody, the one that
kept us all laughing.


54
0:2:50,4 --> 0:2:51,61
He was almost 11--


55
0:2:51,61 --> 0:2:55,19
May 5, 2007, he died.


56
0:2:55,19 --> 0:2:57,18
And it was just really
a freak accident.


57
0:2:57,18 --> 0:2:59,95
I wasn't there, his dad
and Frankie Lee


58
0:2:59,95 --> 0:3:1,1
and Hayden were there.


59
0:3:1,1 --> 0:3:4,75
And he just got into some kind
of wobble that just took him


60
0:3:4,75 --> 0:3:6,9
up into a wall and
hit the wall.


61
0:3:6,9 --> 0:3:9,62
Just too much force for his
body to take, and he died


62
0:3:9,62 --> 0:3:12,16
about 15-20 minutes
after he hit.


63
0:3:12,16 --> 0:3:15,0
DANNY WALKER: Hayden was one of
the first guys there, and


64
0:3:15,0 --> 0:3:20,42
he knew right away that it
was really, really bad.


65
0:3:20,42 --> 0:3:23,73
It's still something they
struggle with constantly.


66
0:3:23,73 --> 0:3:26,1
KERRI GILLIM: Two weekends
later, he actually went to a


67
0:3:26,1 --> 0:3:28,98
race and I wasn't
crazy about it.


68
0:3:28,98 --> 0:3:31,65
Then when I was watching all of
them, the only time at that


69
0:3:31,65 --> 0:3:34,8
point through that whole year
it seemed like that's where


70
0:3:34,8 --> 0:3:35,35
they were the happiest.


71
0:3:35,35 --> 0:3:37,115
So I was like I can't
make them stop.


72
0:3:37,115 --> 0:3:38,81
Five laps and you're
coming in.


73
0:3:38,81 --> 0:3:40,96
MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]
doing a five lap race.


74
0:3:40,96 --> 0:3:42,88
KERRI GILLIM: Five lap
race and done.


75
0:3:42,88 --> 0:3:47,68



76
0:3:47,68 --> 0:3:49,97
The more kids you have and the
more people you have at your


77
0:3:49,97 --> 0:3:52,835
house, the more likely they'll
stay at the house and then you


78
0:3:52,835 --> 0:3:54,85
know what's going on.


79
0:3:54,85 --> 0:4:18,763



80
0:4:18,763 --> 0:4:22,42
HAYDEN GILLIM: Owensboro has
a lot of kids that race.


81
0:4:22,42 --> 0:4:24,93
Everybody always comes over to
our house, just because we


82
0:4:24,93 --> 0:4:27,64
have a track and our parents
don't really care about how


83
0:4:27,64 --> 0:4:28,99
dirty the house gets.


84
0:4:28,99 --> 0:4:32,56



85
0:4:32,56 --> 0:4:35,358
Barbecue here's amazing.


86
0:4:35,358 --> 0:4:37,77
This is Kentucky.


87
0:4:37,77 --> 0:4:39,66
You don't find bad barbecue
in Kentucky.


88
0:4:39,66 --> 0:5:0,859



89
0:5:0,859 --> 0:5:3,97
KERRI GILLIM: Once Ethan died,
all of his friends at first,


90
0:5:3,97 --> 0:5:6,64
the first few months, stopped
coming over because I don't


91
0:5:6,64 --> 0:5:8,46
think they knew where
their place was.


92
0:5:8,46 --> 0:5:11,82
And then as we would say you
could come over, come over.


93
0:5:11,82 --> 0:5:15,21
And then they came over and
would realize it's not creepy,


94
0:5:15,21 --> 0:5:16,68
it's OK to talk about him.


95
0:5:16,68 --> 0:5:20,448



96
0:5:20,448 --> 0:5:21,861
MALE SPEAKER: Oh, Hayden.


97
0:5:21,861 --> 0:5:27,5
I'll see if you can spell a
three-letter word, like sweet.


98
0:5:27,5 --> 0:5:29,44
But it's harder if they
weren't here.


99
0:5:29,44 --> 0:5:31,92
Then it would be lonely
and Ethan


100
0:5:31,92 --> 0:5:33,17
wouldn't have liked that.


101
0:5:33,17 --> 0:5:47,377



102
0:5:47,377 --> 0:5:49,6
FRANKIE LEE GILLIM: Me and
Hayden, we're real


103
0:5:49,6 --> 0:5:49,985
competitive.


104
0:5:49,985 --> 0:5:52,81
We road race, we don't really
race each other.


105
0:5:52,81 --> 0:5:56,36
But flat track, we're in the
same classes and stuff.


106
0:5:56,36 --> 0:5:59,626
I get more mad if he beats
me than anybody else.


107
0:5:59,626 --> 0:6:1,56
Because it's my brother and we'd
be riding home together


108
0:6:1,56 --> 0:6:4,13
and if I say something wrong,
he'll be like well, sh, be


109
0:6:4,13 --> 0:6:7,955
quiet, I beat you today and it
makes us all mad and stuff.


110
0:6:7,955 --> 0:6:10,17
Because we ride here together,
we can push


111
0:6:10,17 --> 0:6:11,42
each other to go faster.


112
0:6:11,42 --> 0:6:20,664



113
0:6:20,664 --> 0:6:23,35
HAYDEN GILLIM: During the
summers, it's really hard to


114
0:6:23,35 --> 0:6:25,57
get yourself motivated to work
out because of the heat.


115
0:6:25,57 --> 0:6:28,6



116
0:6:28,6 --> 0:6:30,63
The average is 90 degrees,
and then the


117
0:6:30,63 --> 0:6:33,7
humidity here is horrible.


118
0:6:33,7 --> 0:6:36,68
It just makes you have to push
that much harder with how the


119
0:6:36,68 --> 0:6:38,64
landscape is here.


120
0:6:38,64 --> 0:6:57,33



121
0:6:57,33 --> 0:7:0,38
FRANKIE GILLIM: I don't think
any of this year he's actually


122
0:7:0,38 --> 0:7:2,2
been mentally prepared.


123
0:7:2,2 --> 0:7:4,6
It's kind of thrown a curve ball
to me to try to figure


124
0:7:4,6 --> 0:7:6,67
out what to say to him.


125
0:7:6,67 --> 0:7:10,8
Try to help improve or try to
help him realize that it's


126
0:7:10,8 --> 0:7:11,6
just a learning process
and this is


127
0:7:11,6 --> 0:7:12,43
something you have to overcome.


128
0:7:12,43 --> 0:7:16,62
KERRI GILLIM: The first year I
think that they worried about


129
0:7:16,62 --> 0:7:19,95
me and Frankie more on how we
were taking it, how we were


130
0:7:19,95 --> 0:7:21,85
living, how we were
going to survive.


131
0:7:21,85 --> 0:7:24,21
But the second year, I've always
heard it's worse on the


132
0:7:24,21 --> 0:7:25,43
kids and it is.


133
0:7:25,43 --> 0:7:27,38
I think this second year's
been really hard on them.


134
0:7:27,38 --> 0:7:29,34
DANNY WALKER: I'll never,
ever, ever,


135
0:7:29,34 --> 0:7:33,9
get over losing him.


136
0:7:33,9 --> 0:7:37,12
It's weird, it's just such
a strong spirit--


137
0:7:37,12 --> 0:7:38,92
you don't come across
those that often.


138
0:7:38,92 --> 0:7:41,7
And the 10-year-old that's made
such a difference in my


139
0:7:41,7 --> 0:7:45,63
life on how I talk to people
and treat people.


140
0:7:45,63 --> 0:7:49,19
It's really a tough thing for
the Gillim family, and


141
0:7:49,19 --> 0:7:50,38
everybody that was there.


142
0:7:50,38 --> 0:7:54,156
It's a tough thing to go OK,
we're sending him back out.


143
0:7:54,156 --> 0:7:56,4
HAYDEN GILLIM: I'm not
scared to die.


144
0:7:56,4 --> 0:8:2,1
As long as I'm going to heaven,
I'll just embrace it


145
0:8:2,1 --> 0:8:7,118
and I'll go up there and hang
out with my little brother and


146
0:8:7,118 --> 0:8:12,6
all the friends that
have died racing.


147
0:8:12,6 --> 0:8:14,72
I'll just go up there and hang
out with them, race some


148
0:8:14,72 --> 0:8:15,97
motorcycles.


149
0:8:15,97 --> 0:10:15,97
