SO QUICKLY IN OVERTIME TO GET


66
0:2:29,6 --> 0:2:31,1

67
0:2:31,1 --> 0:2:32,767
STILL HIGH ON THE OTHER GOAL,


68
0:2:32,767 --> 0:2:34,833
YOU KNOW? IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE


69
0:2:34,833 --> 0:2:36,633
HOW QUICKLY WE GOT IT DONE AND


70
0:2:36,633 --> 0:2:37,733
THERE WAS NO DOUBT IN OUR MINDS


71
0:2:37,733 --> 0:2:38,867
WE WERE GOING TO WIN THE HOCKEY


72
0:2:38,867 --> 0:2:40,5
GAME. WILSON: ONCE WE SCORED THE


73
0:2:40,5 --> 0:2:41,833
GOAL AND THEN WE HAD THE LITTLE


74
0:2:41,833 --> 0:2:44,67
BREAK GOING INTO OVERTIME THE


75
0:2:44,67 --> 0:2:44,967
ONE THING WE TALKED ABOUT WAS


76
0:2:44,967 --> 0:2:45,9
THE PLACE IS GOING NUTS, LET'S


77
0:2:45,9 --> 0:2:47,333
USE THIS MOMENTUM AND TRY AND


78
0:2:47,333 --> 0:2:48,867
JUMP ON THEM RIGHT AWAY AND WITH


79
0:2:48,867 --> 0:2:50,633
ONLY FIVE MINUTES OF HOCKEY LEFT


80
0:2:50,633 --> 0:2:52,333
WE WANT TO GET AFTER IT RIGHT


81
0:2:52,333 --> 0:2:53,6
AWAY AND THEY MUST HAVE TAKEN


82
0:2:53,6 --> 0:2:56,133
THOSE WORDS TO HEART BECAUSE THE


83
0:2:56,133 --> 0:2:57,5
FIRST SHIFT WE GET THE WIN. WE


84
0:2:57,5 --> 0:2:58,967
WERE HOPING FOR THAT BECAUSE WE


85
0:2:58,967 --> 0:3:0,2
KNEW THEY WERE GOING TO BE A


86
0:3:0,2 --> 0:3:1,567
LITTLE BIT DOWN GIVING UP A LATE


87
0:3:1,567 --> 0:3:2,733
GOAL AND LIKE I SAID, WITH THE


88
0:3:2,733 --> 0:3:4,567
CROWD, WE WANTED TO JUMP ON THEM


89
0:3:4,567 --> 0:3:5,9
AND WE DID AND IT WAS GREAT.


90
0:3:5,9 --> 0:3:7,67
MITCHELL: I'VE ONLY BEEN HERE


91
0:3:7,67 --> 0:3:8,367
TWO YEARS, BUT TYING LAST YEAR


92
0:3:8,367 --> 0:3:10,4
WAS JUST A TERRIBLE FEELING AND


93
0:3:10,4 --> 0:3:11,767
BEING ABLE TO SCORE THAT GOAL IN


94
0:3:11,767 --> 0:3:13,933
OVERTIME WAS JUST UNBELIEVABLE.


95
0:3:13,933 --> 0:3:14,967
HILL: WHAT HAPPENED TO GET THAT


96
0:3:14,967 --> 0:3:16,5
WINNING GOAL? MITCHELL: I THINK


97
0:3:16,5 --> 0:3:17,9
WE LOST THE FACE OFF AND THE


98
0:3:17,9 --> 0:3:19,5
PUCK WENT UP IN THE AIR AND BURT


99
0:3:19,5 --> 0:3:22,533
ENDED UP WITH IT ON HIS STICK


100
0:3:22,533 --> 0:3:23,9
AND JUST KIND OF MADE A CHIP


101
0:3:23,9 --> 0:3:24,833
PASS TO MCGOWAN, WHO THEN


102
0:3:24,833 --> 0:3:25,967
CHIPPED IT OVER TO ME AND I KIND


103
0:3:25,967 --> 0:3:27,0
OF BOBBLED IT BUT I ENDED UP


104
0:3:27,0 --> 0:3:29,133
SCORING THE GOAL AND THE CROWD


105
0:3:29,133 --> 0:3:32,367
KIND OF WENT NUTS AND IT WAS


106
0:3:32,367 --> 0:3:33,667
JUST AN AMAZING FEELING.


107
0:3:33,667 --> 0:3:35,533
DITULLIO: THERE IT IS; CAREY


108
0:3:35,533 --> 0:3:37,0
COULDN'T CLEAR THE PUCK, BURT


109
0:3:37,0 --> 0:3:38,567
KEEPS IT IN, JUST THROWS IT ON


110
0:3:38,567 --> 0:3:41,533
NET, WHICH HE SHOULD DO, AND


111
0:3:41,533 --> 0:3:43,4
HARTLEY SPINNING AROUND, FINALLY


112
0:3:43,4 --> 0:3:44,7
LOCATES IT. HILL: THAT THIRD


113
0:3:44,7 --> 0:3:45,8
PERIOD GOAL THAT YOU SCORED,


114
0:3:45,8 --> 0:3:46,833
WHAT HAPPENED THERE? HARTLEY:


115
0:3:46,833 --> 0:3:48,1
COACH JUST SAID GO TO THE NET


116
0:3:48,1 --> 0:3:49,9
AND HOPE FOR THE BEST AND I'VE


117
0:3:49,9 --> 0:3:51,0
GOT TO GIVE BURT CREDIT, HE


118
0:3:51,0 --> 0:3:52,6
WORKED HARD, GOT TO THE PUCK,


119
0:3:52,6 --> 0:3:54,167
HELD IT IN AND THREW IT ON NET


120
0:3:54,167 --> 0:3:55,167
AND IT WAS JUST THERE WAITING


121
0:3:55,167 --> 0:3:56,567
FOR ME. HILL: WHAT WAS IT LIKE


122
0:3:56,567 --> 0:3:57,833
GETTING TWO GOALS TONIGHT, FIVE


123
0:3:57,833 --> 0:3:58,9
POINTS, HOW DO YOU THINK THAT


124
0:3:58,9 --> 0:4:1,4
AFFECTED THE TEAM? POTTS: I HOPE


125
0:4:1,4 --> 0:4:3,333
IT ENERGIZED THE TEAM, I WAS


126
0:4:3,333 --> 0:4:4,9
JUST DOING WHAT I HAD TO DO AND


127
0:4:4,9 --> 0:4:5,867
WHAT I COULD DO TO HELP THE TEAM


128
0:4:5,867 --> 0:4:7,67

129
0:4:7,67 --> 0:4:8,5

131
0:4:9,867 --> 0:4:11,3
POINTS ON THE BOARD. WILSON:


132
0:4:11,3 --> 0:4:12,5

0:4:18,6 --> 0:4:19,967
HOCKEY STILL IN FRONT OF US, BUT


139
0:4:19,967 --> 0:4:20,933
IF CAM BURT'S PLAYING VERY WELL


140
0:4:20,933 --> 0:4:23,133

141
0:4:23,133 --> 0:4:24,667

TONIGHT. NEW SPEAKER: JUST A


153
0:4:38,267 --> 0:4:39,9
WAVE OF EMOTIONS. PERSONALLY, AN

0:4:39,9 --> 0:4:41,567
UP AND DOWN GAME, AS A TEAM I

159
0:4:48,233 --> 0:4:49,767
LITTLE MORE CONFIDENCE WHEN WE


160
0:4:49,767 --> 0:4:50,867
COME IN HERE. NEW SPEAKER: THE


161
0:4:50,867 --> 0:4:52,367
CROWD REALLY HELPS US OUT, PUMPS


162
0:4:52,367 --> 0:4:53,567
US UP, WHEN WE SCORED THAT GOAL


163
0:4:53,567 --> 0:4:55,0
WITH NINE SECONDS LEFT TO TIE IT


164
0:4:55,0 --> 0:4:57,367

169
0:5:1,733 --> 0:5:3,0
ALUMNI AND YOU KNOW, IT REALLY


170
0:5:3,0 --> 0:5:4,67
FEEDS US AS A TEAM. WHEN WE'RE


171
0:5:4,67 --> 0:5:5,333
DOWN FIVE THREE AND WE HEAR THEM


172
0:5:5,333 --> 0:5:6,4
CHANTING IN THE BACKGROUND IT


173
0:5:6,4 --> 0:5:7,8
REALLY MOTIVATES US TO GO OUT


174
0:5:7,8 --> 0:5:9,133
THERE AND GIVE IT ALL AND TRY TO


175
0:5:9,133 --> 0:5:10,867
COME BACK AND GET THE WIN. YOU


176
0:5:10,867 --> 0:5:12,367
KNOW, IT'S HOMECOMING HERE AT


177
0:5:12,367 --> 0:5:14,2
RIT, PUTTING THE SWEATER ON WAS


178
0:5:14,2 --> 0:5:15,467
GREAT TO HAVE ONE UNDER OUR


179
0:5:15,467 --> 0:5:17,33
BELT. IT'S GOING TO BE MY LAST


180
0:5:17,33 --> 0:5:18,3
ONE SO I DIDN'T WANT TO LEAVE


181
0:5:18,3 --> 0:5:19,6
WITH A LOSS AND SEEING ALL THE


182
0:5:19,6 --> 0:5:21,167
ALUMNI AND EVERYBODY GOING CRAZY


183
0:5:21,167 --> 0:5:23,167
AND SEE ALL THE OLDER HOCKEY


184
0:5:23,167 --> 0:5:24,3
PLAYERS THAT PLAYED BEFORE JUST


185
0:5:24,3 --> 0:5:25,6
LOSING IT BEHIND THE GLASS, IT


186
0:5:25,6 --> 0:5:26,833
WAS A GREAT TIME AND I KNOW


187
0:5:26,833 --> 0:5:27,867
THOSE GUYS WERE PROUD OF US AND


188
0:5:27,867 --> 0:5:29,6
WE COULDN'T BE HERE WITHOUT THEM


189
0:5:29,6 --> 0:5:31,533
AND THE WORK THEY PUT INTO IT.


190
0:5:31,533 --> 0:5:33,267
WILSON: IT'S OBVIOUSLY A GREAT


191
0:5:33,267 --> 0:5:35,133
FEELING. LAST YEAR WE TIED THE


192
0:5:35,133 --> 0:5:37,67
GAME; THEY TIED US UP WITH I


193
0:5:37,67 --> 0:5:38,833
THINK A SECOND LEFT AND WE ENDED


194
0:5:38,833 --> 0:5:39,967
UP TYING THE GAME BUT IT DID


195
0:5:39,967 --> 0:5:41,367
FEEL LIKE A LOSS AND WE


196
0:5:41,367 --> 0:5:42,967
REMEMBERED THAT AND I THINK THE


197
0:5:42,967 --> 0:5:44,833
THING THAT STANDS OUT ABOUT THIS


198
0:5:44,833 --> 0:5:46,4
GAME WAS MENTALLY I THOUGHT WE


199
0:5:46,4 --> 0:5:47,6
SHOWED SOME REAL STRONG


200
0:5:47,6 --> 0:5:48,5
STRENGTH. WE GAVE UP A


201
0:5:48,5 --> 0:5:50,333
SHORTHANDED GOAL AND REBOUNDED


202
0:5:50,333 --> 0:5:52,0
FROM THAT AND SCORED OBVIOUSLY A


203
0:5:52,0 --> 0:5:53,767
BIG GOAL TO TIE IT UP AND THEN


204
0:5:53,767 --> 0:5:55,5
GETTING THE WIN GOAL. SO I


205
0:5:55,5 --> 0:5:56,733
THOUGHT EXECUTION WISE WE HAVE


206
0:5:56,733 --> 0:5:57,9
THINGS TO WORK ON, BUT I WAS


207
0:5:57,9 --> 0:5:58,867
VERY HAPPY WHERE WE WERE; I


208
0:5:58,867 --> 0:5:59,967
THOUGHT WE WERE VERY STRONG


209
0:5:59,967 --> 0:6:1,533
MENTALLY TO GET THROUGH SOME


210
0:6:1,533 --> 0:6:3,67
ADVERSITY AND HOPEFULLY THAT


211
0:6:3,67 --> 0:6:12,5
WILL HELP US OUT IN SOME OTHER

0:7:1,667 --> 0:7:2,7
SPORTSZONE. NOW EARLIER THIS


231
0:7:2,7 --> 0:7:4,133
MONTH A MAJOR FACELIFT WAS


232
0:7:4,133 --> 0:7:5,567
COMPLETED AT RITTER ARENA AND


233
0:7:5,567 --> 0:7:7,233
WHILE THE PROJECT DIDN'T ADD ANY


234
0:7:7,233 --> 0:7:9,1
ADDITIONAL SEATING, IT CERTAINLY


235
0:7:9,1 --> 0:7:10,567
PROVIDED SOME MUCH NEEDED


236
0:7:10,567 --> 0:7:13,233
AMENITIES FOR CURRENT AND FUTURE


237
0:7:13,233 --> 0:7:22,567
TIGERS. SZ'S COURTNEY TENANT HAS


238
0:7:22,567 --> 0:7:23,933
THE STORY. TENANT: RITTER ARENA


239
0:7:23,933 --> 0:7:25,867
HAS FINALLY EXPANDED. NOT FOR


240
0:7:25,867 --> 0:7:27,167
THE FANS, BUT FOR THE PLAYERS.


241
0:7:27,167 --> 0:7:28,433
THE THREE AND A HALF MILLION


242
0:7:28,433 --> 0:7:30,67
DOLLAR LOCKER ROOM FACILITIES


243
0:7:30,67 --> 0:7:33,33
WILL NOW BE HOME TO BOTH THE


244
0:7:33,33 --> 0:7:36,233
MEN'S AND WOMEN'S HOCKEY


245
0:7:36,233 --> 0:7:37,667
PROGRAMS. WHAT DOES THE TEAM


246
0:7:37,667 --> 0:7:39,1
THINK OF THE NEW FACILITIES?


247
0:7:39,1 --> 0:7:40,33
WILSON: WELL WE JUST MOVED IN


248
0:7:40,33 --> 0:7:41,333
YESTERDAY, SO THEY'RE PRETTY


249
0:7:41,333 --> 0:7:42,5
EXCITED. WE HAD A GOOD PRACTICE.


250
0:7:42,5 --> 0:7:43,733
I WAS WONDERING IF THEY WERE


251
0:7:43,733 --> 0:7:45,67
GOING TO BE GETTING CARRIED AWAY


252
0:7:45,67 --> 0:7:46,433
BUT I THINK THEY'RE VERY


253
0:7:46,433 --> 0:7:48,1
APPRECIATIVE OF THE FACILITY


254
0:7:48,1 --> 0:7:50,433
THAT WE HAVE. FROM MY


255
0:7:50,433 --> 0:7:51,767
STANDPOINT, IT'S A LOT OF HARD


256
0:7:51,767 --> 0:7:54,0
WORK ON EVERYONE THAT'S PLAYED


257
0:7:54,0 --> 0:7:55,33
BEFORE THEM. NEW SPEAKER: IT'S


258
0:7:55,33 --> 0:7:55,967
KIND OF A TESTAMENT TO THE LAST


259
0:7:55,967 --> 0:7:57,733
COUPLE OF YEARS AND HOW WELL RIT


260
0:7:57,733 --> 0:8:0,1
HOCKEY'S DONE AND I THINK THAT


261
0:8:0,1 --> 0:8:1,533
YOU KNOW, IT'S A BIG STEP


262
0:8:1,533 --> 0:8:3,0
FORWARD. I THINK THAT THE


263
0:8:3,0 --> 0:8:3,9
ORGANIZATION AND THE SCHOOL IS


264
0:8:3,9 --> 0:8:5,567
GOING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION IN


265
0:8:5,567 --> 0:8:7,167
REGARDS TO ATHLETICS AND I THINK


266
0:8:7,167 --> 0:8:8,333
THAT IT SHOWS THEIR COMMITMENT


267
0:8:8,333 --> 0:8:9,733
TO US AND OUR COMMITMENT TO


268
0:8:9,733 --> 0:8:11,733
THEM. TENANT: SO WHAT DOES THIS


269
0:8:11,733 --> 0:8:13,5
LOCKER ROOM MEAN FOR RECRUITING


270
0:8:13,5 --> 0:8:16,233
PURPOSES? NEW SPEAKER: IT'S


271
0:8:16,233 --> 0:8:17,367
GOING TO GO A LONG WAY. OUR


272
0:8:17,367 --> 0:8:18,8
PROGRAM HAS GROWN SO MUCH, EVEN


273
0:8:18,8 --> 0:8:20,7
IN THE THREE YEARS THAT I'VE


274
0:8:20,7 --> 0:8:22,667
BEEN HERE. GOING INTO MY FOURTH


275
0:8:22,667 --> 0:8:24,133
YEAR, WE WERE HOPING TO GET


276
0:8:24,133 --> 0:8:25,133
SOMETHING LIKE THIS AND THIS


277
0:8:25,133 --> 0:8:26,133
KIND OF EXCEEDS ALL OF OUR


278
0:8:26,133 --> 0:8:27,4
EXPECTATIONS. COMING INTO A


279
0:8:27,4 --> 0:8:29,6
LOCKER ROOM AS A RECRUIT AND


280
0:8:29,6 --> 0:8:30,633
SEEING SOMETHING LIKE THIS, IT'S


281
0:8:30,633 --> 0:8:32,33
A GREAT SELLING POINT. I MEAN I


282
0:8:32,33 --> 0:8:34,1
WOULD BE HARD PRESSED TO FIND


283
0:8:34,1 --> 0:8:36,133
ANOTHER COLLEGE TEAM WITH A


284
0:8:36,133 --> 0:8:37,2
LOCKER ROOM AS NICE AS THIS.


285
0:8:37,2 --> 0:8:40,133
WILSON: THE SPACE THAT'S BEEN


286
0:8:40,133 --> 0:8:41,467
GIVEN TO US FROM OUR


287
0:8:41,467 --> 0:8:43,5
ADMINISTRATION IS OUTSTANDING,


288
0:8:43,5 --> 0:8:45,767
AND IT REALLY IS VERY, VERY


289
0:8:45,767 --> 0:8:47,133
IMPRESSIVE AND I THINK THAT IT


290
0:8:47,133 --> 0:8:48,533
WILL SHOW VERY WELL TO RECRUITS


291
0:8:48,533 --> 0:8:50,633
AS WE BRING THEM IN FOR VISITS.


292
0:8:50,633 --> 0:8:52,333
NEW SPEAKER: THEY TOLD ME WHEN I


293
0:8:52,333 --> 0:8:54,267
WAS RECRUITED THAT IT WOULD BE


294
0:8:54,267 --> 0:8:55,767
READY FOR MY FRESHMAN YEAR,


295
0:8:55,767 --> 0:8:57,5
WHICH THEY DELIVERED SO IT'S


296
0:8:57,5 --> 0:8:58,8
PRETTY EXCITING. TENANT: IS IT


297
0:8:58,8 --> 0:8:59,9
EVERYTHING THAT THEY TOLD YOU IT


298
0:8:59,9 --> 0:9:1,533
WOULD BE? NEW SPEAKER:


299
0:9:1,533 --> 0:9:2,9
EVERYTHING AND MORE, DEFINITELY.


300
0:9:2,9 --> 0:9:4,533
IT'S REALLY NICE. TENANT: WHAT


301
0:9:4,533 --> 0:9:6,733
DOES THE LOCKER ROOM MEAN FOR


302
0:9:6,733 --> 0:9:8,267
BONDING FOR YOU AND YOUR TEAM?


303
0:9:8,267 --> 0:9:10,5
NEW SPEAKER: IT'S DEFINITELY


304
0:9:10,5 --> 0:9:13,67
BIGGER. THE LAST ONE WAS SMALLER


305
0:9:13,67 --> 0:9:14,9
SO WE WERE ABLE TO INTERACT WITH


306
0:9:14,9 --> 0:9:16,867
EACH OTHER EASILY, BUT I THINK


307
0:9:16,867 --> 0:9:18,433
OUR LOCKER ROOM EVERYONE HEARS


308
0:9:18,433 --> 0:9:19,467
US SAYING, 'I CAN'T WAIT TO GO


309
0:9:19,467 --> 0:9:20,433
BACK TO THE DRESSING ROOM! I


310
0:9:20,433 --> 0:9:21,4
JUST WANT TO HANG OUT THERE!'


311
0:9:21,4 --> 0:9:22,267
AND STUFF LIKE THAT, SO IT'S


312
0:9:22,267 --> 0:9:23,167
GOING TO BE GOOD FOR US. WILSON:


313
0:9:23,167 --> 0:9:24,367
WE'VE GOT TO BE A LITTLE BIT


314
0:9:24,367 --> 0:9:25,567
CAREFUL THAT OUR TEAM ISN'T


315
0:9:25,567 --> 0:9:26,6
SPLINTERED SO IF THERE'S FIVE


316
0:9:26,6 --> 0:9:27,933
GUYS IN OUR ROOM, THREE IN THE


317
0:9:27,933 --> 0:9:29,533
TRAINING ROOM, TWO IN THE VIDEO


318
0:9:29,533 --> 0:9:31,33
ROOM AND SO ON, THAT'S ONE THING


319
0:9:31,33 --> 0:9:32,333
I DID LIKE ABOUT OUR OLD ROOM


320
0:9:32,333 --> 0:9:35,367
WAS SMALL AND COZY, WE'LL SAY,


321
0:9:35,367 --> 0:9:38,233
AS IT WAS, IT WAS GREAT FOR I


322
0:9:38,233 --> 0:9:40,2
THINK CHEMISTRY OF THE TEAM,


323
0:9:40,2 --> 0:9:41,833
GETTING TO KNOW THE OTHER GUYS


324
0:9:41,833 --> 0:9:43,67
ON YOUR TEAM VERY WELL BECAUSE


325
0:9:43,67 --> 0:9:44,5
THERE WAS NOWHERE ELSE TO GO. I


326
0:9:44,5 --> 0:9:45,6
THINK WE'LL LOSE A LITTLE BIT OF


327
0:9:45,6 --> 0:9:47,633
THAT, BUT WE'VE TRIED TO MAKE


328
0:9:47,633 --> 0:9:48,9
THIS OUR FOCAL POINT, OUR MAIN


329
0:9:48,9 --> 0:9:51,0
LOCKER ROOM AND KEEP AS MANY


330
0:9:51,0 --> 0:9:53,367
GUYS IN HERE VERSUS SCATTERED IN


331
0:9:53,367 --> 0:9:54,533
ALL THE OTHER FACILITIES. NEW


332
0:9:54,533 --> 0:9:55,667
SPEAKER: I THINK IT DEFINITELY


333
0:9:55,667 --> 0:9:57,3
BOOSTS TEAM MORALE. I THINK EVEN


334
0:9:57,3 --> 0:9:58,433
TODAY, WE MOVED IN LAST NIGHT,


335
0:9:58,433 --> 0:9:59,733
AND TODAY WE HAD A GREAT


336
0:9:59,733 --> 0:10:1,4
PRACTICE, EVERYBODY WAS, YOU


337
0:10:1,4 --> 0:10:3,267
KNOW, THE NEW SOUND SYSTEM AND


338
0:10:3,267 --> 0:10:5,0
PUTTING ON NEW MUSIC AND JUST


339
0:10:5,0 --> 0:10:6,6
KIND OF THE CAMARADERIE THAT


340
0:10:6,6 --> 0:10:9,5
HAPPENS WITH THE GUYS AROUND THE


341
0:10:9,5 --> 0:10:10,667
DRESSING ROOM. I THINK IT'S


342
0:10:10,667 --> 0:10:11,567
DEFINITELY SOMETHING THAT WE'RE


343
0:10:11,567 --> 0:10:13,233
PROUD OF AND SOMETHING THAT


344
0:10:13,233 --> 0:10:14,933
FEELS LIKE HOME. NEW SPEAKER:


345
0:10:14,933 --> 0:10:16,433
JUST THE WAY OUR PROGRAM'S GROWN


346
0:10:16,433 --> 0:10:18,567
OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS AND JUST


347
0:10:18,567 --> 0:10:20,1
ALL THE GUYS WHO HAVE PUT SO


348
0:10:20,1 --> 0:10:21,667
MUCH WORK IN, EVEN BEFORE US, TO


349
0:10:21,667 --> 0:10:24,67
HELP BUILD SOMETHING LIKE THIS,


350
0:10:24,67 --> 0:10:25,233
IT'S JUST GOING TO BRING OUR


351
0:10:25,233 --> 0:10:26,133
TEAM CLOSER TOGETHER AND IT JUST


352
0:10:26,133 --> 0:10:28,3
GIVES US ANOTHER THING TO MAKE


353
0:10:28,3 --> 0:10:33,9
RIT HOCKEY EVEN MORE OF A PROUD


354
0:10:33,9 --> 0:10:35,167
TRADITION. HILL: MEANWHILE, IT'S


355
0:10:35,167 --> 0:10:36,6
BEEN ALMOST A YEAR SINCE RIT


356
0:10:36,6 --> 0:10:37,933

HAS BEEN MADE AND WHEN MIGHT WE


362
0:10:48,333 --> 0:10:49,833
SEE A NEW FACILITY ON CAMPUS? WE


363
0:10:49,833 --> 0:10:57,667

0:11:13,67 --> 0:11:14,9
NOW LET'S FAST FORWARD TO TODAY.


375
0:11:14,9 --> 0:11:16,633
WHERE DO WE STAND IN TERMS OF


376
0:11:16,633 --> 0:11:19,467

377
0:11:19,467 --> 0:11:20,33
BROKEN AND LET'S UPDATE


378
0:11:20,33 --> 0:11:20,867
EVERYBODY ON THE FUNDS AND HOW

0:11:20,867 --> 0:11:22,467
CLOSE ARE WE. WATTERS: OUR


380
0:11:22,467 --> 0:11:23,867
PRESIDENT HAS WORKED VERY HARD,


381
0:11:23,867 --> 0:11:24,7
HE HAS SOME VERY, VERY


382
0:11:24,7 --> 0:11:25,767
INTERESTED FOLKS WHO ARE DOING


383
0:11:25,767 --> 0:11:27,33
SOME VERY SERIOUS DELIBERATION


384
0:11:27,33 --> 0:11:29,67
ON A NAMING OPPORTUNITY. WE ARE


385
0:11:29,67 --> 0:11:31,433
VERY HOPEFUL THAT WITHIN A NEAR


386
0:11:31,433 --> 0:11:34,467
TERM WE MIGHT SEE A CULTIVATION


387
0:11:34,467 --> 0:11:35,833
OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS TO THE


388
0:11:35,833 --> 0:11:37,933
POINT WHERE THERE'S AN


389
0:11:37,933 --> 0:11:39,667
ANNOUNCEMENT. HE'S VERY HOPEFUL


390
0:11:39,667 --> 0:11:41,233
THAT SOME OF THESE INDIVIDUALS


391
0:11:41,233 --> 0:11:42,533
REALLY UNDERSTAND THE COMPELLING


392
0:11:42,533 --> 0:11:43,867
CASE THAT WE HAVE, THE TRUE NEED


393
0:11:43,867 --> 0:11:46,4
THAT WE HAVE, SO I CAN'T SAY


394
0:11:46,4 --> 0:11:47,3
ENOUGH ABOUT HOW HARD HE HAS


395
0:11:47,3 --> 0:11:50,7
WORKED TO REALLY MAKE THIS DREAM


396
0:11:50,7 --> 0:11:51,633
COME TRUE. DITULLIO: I KNOW


397
0:11:51,633 --> 0:11:52,9
YOU'VE BEEN AROUND THE COUNTRY


398
0:11:52,9 --> 0:11:54,167
LOOKING AT OTHER FACILITIES.


399
0:11:54,167 --> 0:11:55,4
TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE


400
0:11:55,4 --> 0:11:56,667
AMENITIES, MAYBE WHAT YOU TOOK


401
0:11:56,667 --> 0:11:58,6
AWAY FROM SOME OF THOSE VISITS.


402
0:11:58,6 --> 0:11:59,833
WATTERS: PITTSBURGH DID A


403
0:11:59,833 --> 0:12:1,633
TERRIFIC JOB WITH THE CONSOL


404
0:12:1,633 --> 0:12:3,9
ENERGY ARENA OF BRINGING IN THE


405
0:12:3,9 --> 0:12:5,167
HISTORY OF PITTSBURGH INTO THAT


406
0:12:5,167 --> 0:12:7,33
FACILITY. THEY DID A NUMBER OF


407
0:12:7,33 --> 0:12:8,533
GREAT THINGS THERE. A NUMBER OF


408
0:12:8,533 --> 0:12:9,933
THE CANADIAN CITIES, WHEN THEY


409
0:12:9,933 --> 0:12:11,833
BUILT THEIR ARENAS, THEY BROUGHT


410
0:12:11,833 --> 0:12:13,267
IN THE HISTORY AND LEGACY OF


411
0:12:13,267 --> 0:12:14,967
THEIR PROGRAMS AND SO WE'VE


412
0:12:14,967 --> 0:12:17,567
LEARNED FROM THOSE TRIPS. WE


413
0:12:17,567 --> 0:12:18,9
WILL BRING IN, ELEMENTS FROM


414
0:12:18,9 --> 0:12:20,233
RITTER AND FROM THE ROCHESTER


415
0:12:20,233 --> 0:12:22,467
COMMUNITY INTO IT SO THAT OUR


416
0:12:22,467 --> 0:12:24,333
DEVOTED FANS AND OUR LOYAL FANS


417
0:12:24,333 --> 0:12:25,867
FROM HERE IN ROCHESTER CAN


418
0:12:25,867 --> 0:12:27,733
REALLY FEEL AN AFFINITY WHEN


419
0:12:27,733 --> 0:12:29,533
THEY WALK IN AND IT WILL MAKE


420
0:12:29,533 --> 0:12:30,967
THEM FEEL AT HOME. ONE OF THE


421
0:12:30,967 --> 0:12:32,233
THINGS THAT WE'RE STILL LOOKING


422
0:12:32,233 --> 0:12:33,5
AT IS HOW MUCH OF AN ACTIVITY


423
0:12:33,5 --> 0:12:35,4
CENTER IS IT AS OPPOSED TO HOW


424
0:12:35,4 --> 0:12:39,533
MUCH OF A HOCKEY ARENA IS IT? IF


425
0:12:39,533 --> 0:12:40,933
YOU MOVE TOWARDS A LITTLE BIT


426
0:12:40,933 --> 0:12:42,5
MORE OF AN ACTIVITY CENTER, IT


427
0:12:42,5 --> 0:12:43,8
HAS DEFINITE IMPLICATIONS FOR


428
0:12:43,8 --> 0:12:44,833
THE GRID SYSTEMS OF THE


429
0:12:44,833 --> 0:12:46,367
BUILDING, WHERE YOU SET UP


430
0:12:46,367 --> 0:12:47,733
SUITES SO THAT THEY'RE NOT


431
0:12:47,733 --> 0:12:49,233
BLOCKED OFF. IF YOU PUT IN


432
0:12:49,233 --> 0:12:51,433
CURTAINS FOR PERFORMANCES AND


433
0:12:51,433 --> 0:12:53,0
CONCERTS, SO WE'RE STILL


434
0:12:53,0 --> 0:12:55,5
THINKING THROUGH HOW MUCH OF IT


435
0:12:55,5 --> 0:12:56,733
WILL BE ACTIVITIES BASED VERSUS


436
0:12:56,733 --> 0:12:58,867
PURE HOCKEY, AND IT WILL BE


437
0:12:58,867 --> 0:12:59,9
DESIGNED TO DELIVER EXACTLY WHAT


438
0:12:59,9 --> 0:13:1,1
WE'RE LOOKING FOR. DITULLIO:


439
0:13:1,1 --> 0:13:2,3
WHEN PEOPLE SAY, YOU KNOW, YOU


440
0:13:2,3 --> 0:13:3,6
JUST UPDATED RITTER; WHY BUILD?


441
0:13:3,6 --> 0:13:4,833
WHAT DO YOU TELL THEM? WATTERS:


442
0:13:4,833 --> 0:13:6,9
IT'S LIKELY THAT RITTER WILL


443
0:13:6,9 --> 0:13:9,6
STILL BE VERY ACTIVE AND IT WILL


444
0:13:9,6 --> 0:13:11,5
SERVE THAT FUNCTION THAT SHOULD


445
0:13:11,5 --> 0:13:12,933
THE NEW FACILITY BE USED FOR AN


446
0:13:12,933 --> 0:13:16,0
ACTIVITY, RITTER WILL BE OUR GO


447
0:13:16,0 --> 0:13:17,333
TO PLACE. DITULLIO: WHEN YOU


448
0:13:17,333 --> 0:13:19,167
LOOK AT CAPACITY, ARE WE LOOKING


449
0:13:19,167 --> 0:13:21,733
FOUR, FOUR TO SIX IN TERMS OF


450
0:13:21,733 --> 0:13:23,433
THE SIZE OF THE ARENA? WATTERS:


451
0:13:23,433 --> 0:13:24,467
YES, RIGHT NOW WE HAVE BEEN


452
0:13:24,467 --> 0:13:25,467
TALKING IN THAT FOUR TO FIVE


453
0:13:25,467 --> 0:13:28,767
RANGE AND OUR PRESIDENT YOU


454
0:13:28,767 --> 0:13:29,933
KNOW, IS STILL CONSIDERING


455
0:13:29,933 --> 0:13:31,333
OPTIONS, BUT I THINK THAT AT


456
0:13:31,333 --> 0:13:33,3
THIS POINT HE'S COMFORTABLE IN


457
0:13:33,3 --> 0:13:34,933
HAVING US PURSUE A PROGRAM THAT


458
0:13:34,933 --> 0:13:36,933
WOULD BE IN THAT FOUR TO FIVE


459
0:13:36,933 --> 0:13:39,33
RANGE. DITULLIO: WHERE DO YOU


460
0:13:39,33 --> 0:13:39,967
FORESEE THE NEW ARENA BEING


461
0:13:39,967 --> 0:13:41,467
BUILT? WATTERS: IT LOOKS RIGHT


462
0:13:41,467 --> 0:13:44,8
NOW THAT THE PORTION OF THE


463
0:13:44,8 --> 0:13:47,333
CAMPUS THAT IS IMMEDIATELY SOUTH


464
0:13:47,333 --> 0:13:49,533
OF GLOBAL VILLAGE, HAS RISEN TO


465
0:13:49,533 --> 0:13:51,967
THE TOP OF THE LIST. THERE'S A


466
0:13:51,967 --> 0:13:53,667
LOT OF GREAT THINGS ABOUT IT.


467
0:13:53,667 --> 0:13:54,867
ONE, IT DISBURSES PEOPLE AWAY


468
0:13:54,867 --> 0:13:55,8
FROM THE FIELD HOUSE AND THE


469
0:13:55,8 --> 0:13:56,933
EXISTING ARENA, SO IF WE HAVE


470
0:13:56,933 --> 0:13:58,333
DUAL EVENTS ON CAMPUS WE WOULD


471
0:13:58,333 --> 0:14:0,667
HAVE TRAFFIC AND A LOT OF PEOPLE


472
0:14:0,667 --> 0:14:2,667
MOVE TO A DIFFERENT ELEMENT OF


473
0:14:2,667 --> 0:14:5,2
THE CAMPUS. DITULLIO: SHOVEL IN


474
0:14:5,2 --> 0:14:6,933
THE GROUND IN 2012, DO YOU


475
0:14:6,933 --> 0:14:8,567
THINK? IS THAT A POSSIBILITY?


476
0:14:8,567 --> 0:14:11,2
WATERS: YOU KNOW, IT IS A


477
0:14:11,2 --> 0:14:13,1
POSSIBILITY. WE'RE PROBABLY SIX


478
0:14:13,1 --> 0:14:15,767
TO SEVEN MONTHS OF A DESIGN


479
0:14:15,767 --> 0:14:17,5
PERIOD ONCE WE GET THE GREEN


480
0:14:17,5 --> 0:14:19,567
LIGHT TO GO, SO IF WE WERE TO


481
0:14:19,567 --> 0:14:21,67
SEE THOSE ANNOUNCEMENTS IN THE


482
0:14:21,67 --> 0:14:22,967
NEXT TWO MONTHS, IT'S VERY


483
0:14:22,967 --> 0:14:24,433
LIKELY WE COULD ACTUALLY BE IN


484
0:14:24,433 --> 0:14:45,333
THE GROUND TOWARDS THE LAST PART


485
0:14:45,333 --> 0:14:46,9
HILL: THE RIT WOMEN'S HOCKEY


486
0:14:46,9 --> 0:14:48,167
TEAM NOT ONLY REACHED THE


487
0:14:48,167 --> 0:14:49,633
DIVISION THREE NATIONAL


488
0:14:49,633 --> 0:14:51,67
CHAMPIONSHIP GAME LAST MARCH,


489
0:14:51,67 --> 0:14:53,6
BUT THEY EARNED THE OPPORTUNITY


490
0:14:53,6 --> 0:14:54,5
TO HOST THE GAME ON HOME ICE.


491
0:14:54,5 --> 0:14:55,333
DITULLIO: BUT THE PERFECT


492
0:14:55,333 --> 0:14:56,967
SCENARIO TURNED OUT TO BE THE


493
0:14:56,967 --> 0:14:58,7
PERFECT STORM AS NORWICH STUNG


494
0:14:58,7 --> 0:15:0,1
THE TIGERS AND LEFT TOWN WITH


495
0:15:0,1 --> 0:15:1,933
THE TITLE. EMILY CLARK SAT DOWN


496
0:15:1,933 --> 0:15:3,633
WITH THIS YEAR'S TEAM AND


497
0:15:3,633 --> 0:15:7,1
DISCOVERED THEY HAVE A MAJOR


498
0:15:7,1 --> 0:15:18,3
CHIP ON THEIR SHOULDER. CLARK:


499
0:15:18,3 --> 0:15:19,1
CAN YOU TELL ME A LITTLE BIT


500
0:15:19,1 --> 0:15:20,133
ABOUT THE DISAPPOINTMENT OF LAST


501
0:15:20,133 --> 0:15:21,2
SEASON AND HOW YOU'RE USING IT


502
0:15:21,2 --> 0:15:22,867
AS MOTIVATION FOR THIS YEAR? NEW


503
0:15:22,867 --> 0:15:24,1
SPEAKER: WELL DEFINITELY LAST


504
0:15:24,1 --> 0:15:26,67
SEASON WAS A HUGE


505
0:15:26,67 --> 0:15:27,2
DISAPPOINTMENT, NO ONE WANTED


506
0:15:27,2 --> 0:15:29,967
OUR SEASON TO END LIKE THAT, BUT


507
0:15:29,967 --> 0:15:32,267
WHAT CAN YOU DO? WE DID HAVE A


508
0:15:32,267 --> 0:15:34,1
GOOD, LONG, STRONG YEAR AND SO


509
0:15:34,1 --> 0:15:35,433
AS OF RIGHT NOW I THINK JUST


510
0:15:35,433 --> 0:15:37,267
MOVING PAST THAT GAME, KIND OF


511
0:15:37,267 --> 0:15:39,133
FORGETTING ABOUT IT AS WE DO


512
0:15:39,133 --> 0:15:40,367
HAVE A NEW SEASON, A NEW TEAM,


513
0:15:40,367 --> 0:15:42,167
BUT AT THE SAME TIME,


514
0:15:42,167 --> 0:15:43,8
REMEMBERING HOW DISAPPOINTING


515
0:15:43,8 --> 0:15:45,5
THAT GAME WAS AND HOW


516
0:15:45,5 --> 0:15:46,6
HEARTBREAKING IT WAS. NEW


517
0:15:46,6 --> 0:15:47,667
SPEAKER: IT'S JUST KIND OF


518
0:15:47,667 --> 0:15:49,233
MOTIVATION TO COME OUT NOW WITH


519
0:15:49,233 --> 0:15:51,267
A BANG, PLAY WITH A CHIP ON OUR


520
0:15:51,267 --> 0:15:54,333
SHOULDER, AS WE KIND OF SAY. BUT


521
0:15:54,333 --> 0:15:56,333
EVEN JUST USING THE EXPERIENCE


522
0:15:56,333 --> 0:15:57,733
OF MAKING IT TO THE NATIONAL


523
0:15:57,733 --> 0:15:58,967
CHAMPIONSHIP BECAUSE NOW LIKE


524
0:15:58,967 --> 0:15:59,933
COACH SAYS, WE'VE SEEN IT ALL,


525
0:15:59,933 --> 0:16:1,4
WE'VE BEEN ALL THE WAY SO NOW


526
0:16:1,4 --> 0:16:3,833
IT'S JUST TAKING IT ONE STEP AT


527
0:16:3,833 --> 0:16:5,0
A TIME DURING THE SEASON.


528
0:16:5,0 --> 0:16:6,1
MCDONALD: WE SHOWED THE GIRLS


529
0:16:6,1 --> 0:16:8,467
THE CHAMPIONSHIP VIDEO FROM LAST


530
0:16:8,467 --> 0:16:10,667
YEAR. YOU SHOULDN'T FORGET THE


531
0:16:10,667 --> 0:16:13,33
FEELING OF GOING SO FAR AND THEN


532
0:16:13,33 --> 0:16:14,9
COMING UP THAT SHORT, BEING SO


533
0:16:14,9 --> 0:16:16,1
CLOSE TO SOMETHING. DURING


534
0:16:16,1 --> 0:16:17,367
WORKOUTS I'LL JUST MENTION THAT


535
0:16:17,367 --> 0:16:18,767
WE DON'T WANT A SECOND PLACE


536
0:16:18,767 --> 0:16:22,33
EFFORT ANYMORE; IT'S FIRST PLACE


537
0:16:22,33 --> 0:16:23,233
OR NOTHING NOW. CLARK: COMING


538
0:16:23,233 --> 0:16:24,533
INTO THE NEW SEASON, HOW DO YOU


539
0:16:24,533 --> 0:16:26,0
FEEL YOUR NEW PLAYERS HAVE GROWN


540
0:16:26,0 --> 0:16:27,133
AND DEVELOPED IN THE OFF SEASON?


541
0:16:27,133 --> 0:16:28,633
MCDONALD: IT LOOKS LIKE THEY ALL


542
0:16:28,633 --> 0:16:31,467
CAME BACK A LITTLE BIT MORE


543
0:16:31,467 --> 0:16:33,733
MOTIVATED. NOT THAT THEY'RE NOT


544
0:16:33,733 --> 0:16:35,33
MOTIVATED, BUT I THINK THE WAY


545
0:16:35,33 --> 0:16:37,7
LAST YEAR ENDED IT KIND OF, IT'S


546
0:16:37,7 --> 0:16:39,133
A LONG SUMMER TO BE THINKING


547
0:16:39,133 --> 0:16:41,0
ABOUT THAT LAST GAME AND HOW IT


548
0:16:41,0 --> 0:16:42,267
FINISHED. THEY LOOK IN SHAPE,


549
0:16:42,267 --> 0:16:44,467
THEY LOOK QUICKER, THEY LOOK


550
0:16:44,467 --> 0:16:48,33
STRONGER AND THEY SEEM MORE


551
0:16:48,33 --> 0:16:49,133
MATURE RIGHT NOW. CLARK: HAVE


552
0:16:49,133 --> 0:16:50,333
YOU SEEN ANYBODY STEPPING UP


553
0:16:50,333 --> 0:16:52,33
INTO THE ROLES THAT WERE ONCE


554
0:16:52,33 --> 0:16:53,533
HELD BY DAGG OR STACK AND HOW


555
0:16:53,533 --> 0:16:54,733
HAVE YOU GUYS BEEN PRACTICING


556
0:16:54,733 --> 0:16:56,2
WITHOUT THEM? MCDONALD: YOU


557
0:16:56,2 --> 0:16:58,7
KNOW, I THINK THE THREE CAPTAINS


558
0:16:58,7 --> 0:17:0,333
FOR SURE, THERE'S A REASON WHY


559
0:17:0,333 --> 0:17:1,433
THREE JUNIORS ARE OUR CAPTAINS


560
0:17:1,433 --> 0:17:3,8
NOW. THEY WERE STARTING TO STEP


561
0:17:3,8 --> 0:17:7,7
INTO THOSE LEADERSHIP ROLES AT


562
0:17:7,7 --> 0:17:9,533
THE END OF LAST YEAR AND IN


563
0:17:9,533 --> 0:17:11,67
SPRING WORKOUTS THEY WERE THE


564
0:17:11,67 --> 0:17:12,4
THREE THAT REALLY KIND OF TOOK


565
0:17:12,4 --> 0:17:14,433
CHARGE OF EVERYTHING AND THOSE


566
0:17:14,433 --> 0:17:16,33
THREE HAVE COMPLETELY EMERGED AS


567
0:17:16,33 --> 0:17:17,1
THE TRUE LEADERS ON OUR TEAM


568
0:17:17,1 --> 0:17:18,767
RIGHT NOW. NEW SPEAKER: I THINK


569
0:17:18,767 --> 0:17:20,667
EVERYONE RETURNING IS KIND OF A


570
0:17:20,667 --> 0:17:21,7
KEY PLAYER FOR US. WE DON'T


571
0:17:21,7 --> 0:17:22,6
REALLY HAVE THE ONE STANDOUT


572
0:17:22,6 --> 0:17:23,933
PLAYER NOW, THE ONE WHO SCORES


573
0:17:23,933 --> 0:17:24,833
ALL THE GOALS OR GETS ALL THE


574
0:17:24,833 --> 0:17:26,2
POINTS, SO IT'S KIND OF A


575
0:17:26,2 --> 0:17:27,267
COMBINED EFFORT FROM EVERYONE ON


576
0:17:27,267 --> 0:17:29,1
THE TEAM. I DON'T SEE OUR TEAM


577
0:17:29,1 --> 0:17:30,5
HAVING ONE POWER FORWARD WHO'S


578
0:17:30,5 --> 0:17:31,5
GOING TO PUT UP 30 GOALS LIKE


579
0:17:31,5 --> 0:17:33,367
STACK COULD, BUT I DEFINITELY


580
0:17:33,367 --> 0:17:34,967
THINK WE HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT


581
0:17:34,967 --> 0:17:36,667
FORWARDS WHO CAN PUT THE PUCK IN


582
0:17:36,667 --> 0:17:39,933
THE NET AND CAN PUT UP AN EQUAL


583
0:17:39,933 --> 0:17:42,733
AMOUNT OF POINTS, IT'S GOING TO


584
0:17:42,733 --> 0:17:44,267
TAKE JUST NOT ONE PERSON, IT'S


585
0:17:44,267 --> 0:17:45,333
GOING TO BE DIFFERENT PEOPLE.


586
0:17:45,333 --> 0:17:46,5
IT'S NICE TO SEE DIFFERENT


587
0:17:46,5 --> 0:17:48,433
PEOPLE STEPPING UP AND STARTING


588
0:17:48,433 --> 0:17:50,467
TO ADJUST INTO THEIR ROLES SO


589
0:17:50,467 --> 0:17:51,767
WE'LL SEE HOW IT GOES. CLARK:


590
0:17:51,767 --> 0:17:54,4
CAN YOU TELL ME A LITTLE BIT


591
0:17:54,4 --> 0:17:55,867
ABOUT YOUR NEW FRESHMEN CLASS


592
0:17:55,867 --> 0:17:56,567
AND WHAT YOU'RE HOPING EACH


593
0:17:56,567 --> 0:17:57,367
PLAYER WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE


594
0:17:57,367 --> 0:17:58,4
TEAM? MCDONALD: IT'S AN EXCITING


595
0:17:58,4 --> 0:18:0,233
BUNCH; THEY'RE ALL A LITTLE


596
0:18:0,233 --> 0:18:1,367
DIFFERENT. THERE'S NO REAL ONE


597
0:18:1,367 --> 0:18:4,267
PLAYER THAT'S THE SAME. TWO


598
0:18:4,267 --> 0:18:5,5
FRESHMEN DEFENSEMEN HAVE COME


599
0:18:5,5 --> 0:18:7,533
IN, THEY LOOK GREAT SO FAR, THEY


600
0:18:7,533 --> 0:18:9,3
LOOK VERY POISED AND CALM AND


601
0:18:9,3 --> 0:18:11,133
PLAYED AT A HIGH LEVEL LAST YEAR


602
0:18:11,133 --> 0:18:13,0
AND THEN THE FOUR FORWARDS,


603
0:18:13,0 --> 0:18:14,367
THERE'S SOME BIG KIDS, THERE'S


604
0:18:14,367 --> 0:18:15,9
SOME SMALL ONES, TOUGH ONES AND


605
0:18:15,9 --> 0:18:19,9
FAST ONES, SO I DON'T THINK, WE


606
0:18:19,9 --> 0:18:21,9
GRADUATED A LOT OF SCORING, BUT


607
0:18:21,9 --> 0:18:23,833
I THINK IF THOSE KIDS PLAY THE


608
0:18:23,833 --> 0:18:25,233
WAY THEY CAN, I DON'T THINK


609
0:18:25,233 --> 0:18:26,367
WE'LL MISS A BEAT. CLARK: WHAT


610
0:18:26,367 --> 0:18:27,333
IS THE TEAM REALLY LOOKING HARD


611
0:18:27,333 --> 0:18:28,7
TO REACH THIS SEASON? NEW


612
0:18:28,7 --> 0:18:29,867
SPEAKER: AS OF RIGHT NOW, I


613
0:18:29,867 --> 0:18:31,2
THINK JUST PREPARING FOR THIS


614
0:18:31,2 --> 0:18:33,0
UPCOMING SEASON AND NOT DWELLING


615
0:18:33,0 --> 0:18:34,1
ON LAST SEASON. I THINK WE


616
0:18:34,1 --> 0:18:35,167

DIFFICULT ROAD, BUT AS OLIVIA

636
0:19:28,267 --> 0:19:36,6
AND A CLEAN SLATE. ANGEROSA:


637
0:19:36,6 --> 0:19:37,2
AFTER A HAZING INCIDENT THAT

GIVEN A CHANCE TO PLAY AGAIN.


641
0:19:41,333 --> 0:19:42,933
HOWEVER, THESE TIGERS MAY HAVE


642
0:19:42,933 --> 0:19:44,33
TO BOUNCE BACK FROM A BAD REP IN


643
0:19:44,33 --> 0:19:45,267
ORDER TO GAIN THE SUPPORT THEY


644
0:19:45,267 --> 0:19:47,467
ONCE HAD. HOW WERE YOU GUYS


645
0:19:47,467 --> 0:19:49,6
FINALLY ABLE TO GET THE RUGBY


646
0:19:49,6 --> 0:19:50,7
TEAM BACK AT RIT? NEW SPEAKER:


647
0:19:50,7 --> 0:19:52,433
IN REALITY, IT'S ALL THANKS TO A


648
0:19:52,433 --> 0:19:53,767
GUY NAMED JOEL WHITWORD. HE


649
0:19:53,767 --> 0:19:54,9
ACTUALLY ALREADY GRADUATED, BUT


650
0:19:54,9 --> 0:19:57,2
HE FOUNDED RIT RUGBY HERE. HE


651
0:19:57,2 --> 0:19:58,6
WAS ABLE TO TALK TO THE PEOPLE


652
0:19:58,6 --> 0:19:59,533
HE NEEDED TO, INCLUDING THE


653
0:19:59,533 --> 0:20:0,967
COLLEGE ACTIVITY BOARD AND THE


654
0:20:0,967 --> 0:20:3,133
CLUB SPORT AND GET US BACK ON,


655
0:20:3,133 --> 0:20:4,233
ACTUALLY A YEAR BEFORE WE WERE


656
0:20:4,233 --> 0:20:5,533
SUPPOSED TO. NEW SPEAKER: IT


657
0:20:5,533 --> 0:20:6,633
ACTUALLY TOOK A LOT OF HARD


658
0:20:6,633 --> 0:20:8,833
WORK, BUT AFTER HASSLING THE


659
0:20:8,833 --> 0:20:10,567
SCHOOL FOR A WHILE AND GETTING


660
0:20:10,567 --> 0:20:13,33
ENOUGH INTEREST BETWEEN ALL THE


661
0:20:13,33 --> 0:20:14,633
DIFFERENT STUDENTS, WE WERE


662
0:20:14,633 --> 0:20:16,67
FINALLY ABLE TO GET ALL THE


663
0:20:16,67 --> 0:20:17,7
PAPERWORK THROUGH AND GET


664
0:20:17,7 --> 0:20:19,33
APPROVED AND THEN WE GOT INTO


665
0:20:19,33 --> 0:20:20,367
THE LEAGUE AFTER A YEAR AND THEN


666
0:20:20,367 --> 0:20:21,667
NOW WE'RE FOUR AND 0. ANGEROSA:


667
0:20:21,667 --> 0:20:23,4
AND HOW'S THE TEAM WORKING TO


668
0:20:23,4 --> 0:20:24,367
GET GOOD STANDING BACK? NEW


669
0:20:24,367 --> 0:20:25,4
SPEAKER: WELL, WE'VE CHANGED OUR


670
0:20:25,4 --> 0:20:26,5
COLORS, WE'VE CHANGED OUR NAME,


671
0:20:26,5 --> 0:20:27,7
THE ENTIRE TEAM IS DIFFERENT,


672
0:20:27,7 --> 0:20:29,467
THE COACH IS DIFFERENT, THERE'S


673
0:20:29,467 --> 0:20:31,633
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING BETWEEN US


674
0:20:31,633 --> 0:20:33,433
AND THAT TEAM. WE'VE KEPT IN


675
0:20:33,433 --> 0:20:35,633
TOUCH WITH THE OLD ALUMNI, BUT


676
0:20:35,633 --> 0:20:36,9
AT THE SAME TIME WE'VE MADE SURE


677
0:20:36,9 --> 0:20:38,5
TO DISTANCE OURSELVES FROM THAT


678
0:20:38,5 --> 0:20:40,4
ACTUAL EVENT THAT HAPPENED THAT


679
0:20:40,4 --> 0:20:41,467
GAVE US SUCH A BAD REPUTATION IN


680
0:20:41,467 --> 0:20:42,367
THE FIRST PLACE. NEW SPEAKER: WE


681
0:20:42,367 --> 0:20:43,167
MAKE SURE THAT THESE GUYS ARE


682
0:20:43,167 --> 0:20:44,1
MAKING HIGH ACADEMIC STANDARDS


683
0:20:44,1 --> 0:20:45,467
FOR THEMSELVES. ONE OF THE


684
0:20:45,467 --> 0:20:46,733
THINGS TOO IS THE FACT THAT WHEN


685
0:20:46,733 --> 0:20:48,267
WE GO AND PLAY OTHER TEAMS, WE


686
0:20:48,267 --> 0:20:49,4
DON'T ALLOW DIRTY PLAY AND WE


687
0:20:49,4 --> 0:20:50,867
MAKE A REAL STRONG POINT TO TALK


688
0:20:50,867 --> 0:20:51,733
TO THE REF BEFOREHAND AND LET


689
0:20:51,733 --> 0:20:52,767
HIM KNOW THAT IF ANY OF OUR


690
0:20:52,767 --> 0:20:53,633
PLAYERS ARE PLAYING DIRTY,


691
0:20:53,633 --> 0:20:54,633
THEY'RE GETTING KICKED OFF THE


692
0:20:54,633 --> 0:20:55,6
CLUB. ANGEROSA: AND DO YOU FEEL


693
0:20:55,6 --> 0:20:56,4
LIKE YOU GUYS ARE STILL UNDER


694
0:20:56,4 --> 0:20:57,4
CLOSE WATCH? NEW SPEAKER: YEAH,


695
0:20:57,4 --> 0:21:0,433
WE'RE DEFINITELY GETTING WATCHED


696
0:21:0,433 --> 0:21:2,7
PRETTY SCRUTINOUSLY, BUT WE'RE


697
0:21:2,7 --> 0:21:4,467
MANAGING AND WE'RE ALSO MAKING


698
0:21:4,467 --> 0:21:5,7
SURE WE DON'T DO ANYTHING THAT


699
0:21:5,7 --> 0:21:6,8
MAKES IT SO WE NEED TO BE


700
0:21:6,8 --> 0:21:8,433
WATCHED, BECAUSE THE LAST THING


701
0:21:8,433 --> 0:21:9,733
WE WANT IS TO NOT BE ABLE TO


702
0:21:9,733 --> 0:21:11,133
PLAY RUGBY JUST BECAUSE OF SOME


703
0:21:11,133 --> 0:21:12,833
STUPID INCIDENT HAPPENING.


704
0:21:12,833 --> 0:21:14,4
ANGEROSA: HOW DID YOU HANDLE NOT


705
0:21:14,4 --> 0:21:15,967
HAVING A RUGBY TEAM AT RIT? NEW


706
0:21:15,967 --> 0:21:17,967
SPEAKER: FOR, I WOULD SAY, THREE


707
0:21:17,967 --> 0:21:19,33
YEARS, I WAS GOING TO THE MEN'S


708
0:21:19,33 --> 0:21:20,533
CLUB AND PLAYING WITH THE


709
0:21:20,533 --> 0:21:22,4
AARDVARKS, WHICH IS ONE OF TWO


710
0:21:22,4 --> 0:21:23,767
MEN'S CLUBS IN ROCHESTER, THE


711
0:21:23,767 --> 0:21:25,2
AARDVARKS AND THE COLONIALS, SO


712
0:21:25,2 --> 0:21:26,667
MOST OF THE GUYS JUST WENT BACK


713
0:21:26,667 --> 0:21:27,9
AND FORTH BETWEEN THOSE TWO


714
0:21:27,9 --> 0:21:29,167
TEAMS AND WE WERE STILL ABLE TO


715
0:21:29,167 --> 0:21:30,133
PLAY, BUT IT'S NOT THE SAME NOT


716
0:21:30,133 --> 0:21:32,0
BEING ABLE TO PLAY FOR AND


717
0:21:32,0 --> 0:21:33,233
SUPPORT YOUR OWN SCHOOL. NEW


718
0:21:33,233 --> 0:21:34,3
SPEAKER: I DIDN'T GET INTO RUGBY


719
0:21:34,3 --> 0:21:35,3
UNTIL I SAW THE FLYER THAT THE


720
0:21:35,3 --> 0:21:36,667
FIRST PRESIDENT, JOEL WHITWORD,


721
0:21:36,667 --> 0:21:38,367
HAD POSTED UP AFTER RESTARTING


722
0:21:38,367 --> 0:21:39,5
THE TEAM AT RIT, SO I HAD NEVER


723
0:21:39,5 --> 0:21:41,33
ACTUALLY EXPERIENCED THE


724
0:21:41,33 --> 0:21:42,7
ORIGINAL RIT RUGBY, BUT COMING


725
0:21:42,7 --> 0:21:43,8
INTO IT, IT WAS KIND OF A COOL,


726
0:21:43,8 --> 0:21:44,7
FRESH FEELING BECAUSE WE GOT A


727
0:21:44,7 --> 0:21:46,33
CHANCE TO ACTUALLY START


728
0:21:46,33 --> 0:21:48,1
SOMETHING NEW. IT WAS COOL TO BE


729
0:21:48,1 --> 0:21:50,4
A PART OF THAT TRADITION TOO.


730
0:21:50,4 --> 0:21:52,433
NEW SPEAKER: MY FRESHMAN YEAR I


731
0:21:52,433 --> 0:21:55,933
MET JOEL AND I STARTED PLAYING


732
0:21:55,933 --> 0:21:58,433
WITH THE AARDVARKS MEN'S CLUB


733
0:21:58,433 --> 0:22:0,2
NEARBY, SO THAT'S HOW I STARTED


734
0:22:0,2 --> 0:22:3,633
GETTING INTO RUGBY AND NOW IT'S


735
0:22:3,633 --> 0:22:4,633
A LOT OF FUN. IT WAS GREAT TO


736
0:22:4,633 --> 0:22:6,33
GET INTO THE SPORT BEFORE


737
0:22:6,33 --> 0:22:7,567
STARTING TO PLAY WITH RIT.


738
0:22:7,567 --> 0:22:8,767
ANGEROSA: AND HOW DID YOU CHANGE


739
0:22:8,767 --> 0:22:10,2
THE RUGBY CULTURE AT RIT? NEW


740
0:22:10,2 --> 0:22:12,67
SPEAKER: THE MAIN THING


741
0:22:12,67 --> 0:22:13,1
OBVIOUSLY IS FOCUSING ON RUGBY


742
0:22:13,1 --> 0:22:13,967
INSTEAD OF FOCUSING ON THE


743
0:22:13,967 --> 0:22:14,967
SOCIAL ASPECT OF RUGBY, BECAUSE


744
0:22:14,967 --> 0:22:15,8
FOCUSING ON THAT ASPECT


745
0:22:15,8 --> 0:22:18,6
OBVIOUSLY GOT US IN TROUBLE. SO


746
0:22:18,6 --> 0:22:20,6
WE DEFINITELY CHANGED THAT AND


747
0:22:20,6 --> 0:22:21,867
AS YOU CAN SEE, WE'RE FOCUSING


748
0:22:21,867 --> 0:22:23,67
ON RUGBY AND WE'RE WINNING. NEW


749
0:22:23,67 --> 0:22:24,233
SPEAKER: I'D SAY A DRASTIC


750
0:22:24,233 --> 0:22:25,533
CHANGE. NOBODY EVEN KNEW ABOUT


751
0:22:25,533 --> 0:22:26,633
RUGBY; HALF THE PEOPLE JUST


752
0:22:26,633 --> 0:22:27,767
THOUGHT RUGBY WAS SOME SPORT


753
0:22:27,767 --> 0:22:29,367
GUYS JUST BEAT ON EACH OTHER,


754
0:22:29,367 --> 0:22:30,433
AND NOW WHEN THEY COME OUT AND


755
0:22:30,433 --> 0:22:31,567
SEE IT, HOPEFULLY WE'LL HAVE


756
0:22:31,567 --> 0:22:32,867
MORE AND MORE PEOPLE COME OUT,


757
0:22:32,867 --> 0:22:33,9
BUT JUST KNOWLEDGE OF THE GAME,


758
0:22:33,9 --> 0:22:35,0
I GUESS, SO THAT PEOPLE KNOW


759
0:22:35,0 --> 0:22:37,533
THAT WE HAVE RUGBY AND BEFORE


760
0:22:37,533 --> 0:22:38,467
THEY DIDN'T. ANGEROSA: DO YOU


761
0:22:38,467 --> 0:22:39,3
STILL FEEL LIKE THE TEAM IS


762
0:22:39,3 --> 0:22:40,333
GETTING ADEQUATE SUPPORT FROM


763
0:22:40,333 --> 0:22:41,3
THE RIT COMMUNITY? NEW SPEAKER:


764
0:22:41,3 --> 0:22:42,5
WITH OUR FIRST TWO HOME GAMES,


765
0:22:42,5 --> 0:22:44,9
WE'VE DEFINITELY SEEN A LOT OF


766
0:22:44,9 --> 0:22:46,333
PEOPLE COMING OUT, ESPECIALLY


767
0:22:46,333 --> 0:22:47,767
THE LAST HOME GAME WHERE IT WAS


768
0:22:47,767 --> 0:22:49,933
KIND OF CRAPPY WEATHER. GET THEM


769
0:22:49,933 --> 0:22:52,67
OUT ON THE SIDELINES. NEW


770
0:22:52,67 --> 0:22:53,233
SPEAKER: IT'S NICE JUST HAVING


771
0:22:53,233 --> 0:22:54,6
PEOPLE KNOW, EVEN IF THEY DON'T


772
0:22:54,6 --> 0:22:56,1
KNOW HOW TO PLAY THE SPORT O


773
0:22:56,1 --> 0:22:57,433
RUGBY, THEY STILL COME OUT TO


774
0:22:57,433 --> 0:22:58,8
WATCH THE GAME AND THEY SEEM TO


775
0:22:58,8 --> 0:23:0,2
ENJOY IT. NEW SPEAKER: EVER


776
0:23:0,2 --> 0:23:1,533
SINCE WE STARTED BACK UP, WE'RE


777
0:23:1,533 --> 0:23:2,833
SLOWLY GETTING MORE AND MORE


778
0:23:2,833 --> 0:23:4,267
SUPPORT. WE STARTED OFF WITH NO


779
0:23:4,267 --> 0:23:5,767
FUNDS FROM THE SCHOOL LAST YEAR,


780
0:23:5,767 --> 0:23:8,967
AND WE'VE ALREADY INCREASED THAT


781
0:23:8,967 --> 0:23:10,733
FROM ZERO TO $1,400 AND WE HAVE


782
0:23:10,733 --> 0:23:13,67
AN ACADEMIC ADVISOR, WE WERE


783
0:23:13,67 --> 0:23:13,967
ACTUALLY GIVEN FOR FREE ONE OF


784
0:23:13,967 --> 0:23:14,867
THE AUDITORIUMS TO USE FOR FREE


785
0:23:14,867 --> 0:23:15,867
EVERY SINGLE FRIDAY. THE


786
0:23:15,867 --> 0:23:17,267
COMMUNITY HAS BEEN VERY


787
0:23:17,267 --> 0:23:18,467
SUPPORTIVE AND VERY HELPFUL AND


788
0:23:18,467 --> 0:23:19,867
WITHOUT THEM I'M NOT SURE WE


789
0:23:19,867 --> 0:23:20,867
WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET THIS


790
0:23:20,867 --> 0:23:27,267
FAR AS QUICKLY AS WE DID.


791
0:23:27,267 --> 0:23:28,667
