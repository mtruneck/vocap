2
0:0:33,82 --> 0:0:36,67
HAMILTON MORRIS: Since leaving
Crescent's peristyle, I've


3
0:0:36,67 --> 0:0:40,9
been plagued by questions
regarding the man I saw locked


4
0:0:40,9 --> 0:0:42,11
in the shed.


5
0:0:42,11 --> 0:0:45,48
Unlike classic descriptions of
the zombie, this man was not


6
0:0:45,48 --> 0:0:47,71
shy nor sullen.


7
0:0:47,71 --> 0:0:50,54
Indeed, he was screaming.


8
0:0:50,54 --> 0:0:53,86
It would be equally foolish to
blindly trust or completely


9
0:0:53,86 --> 0:0:55,56
dismiss what I have seen.


10
0:0:55,56 --> 0:0:59,48
But I can say with certainty
that it chilled me to the very


11
0:0:59,48 --> 0:1:1,98
threads of my cultural
tapestry.


12
0:1:1,98 --> 0:1:8,48



13
0:1:8,48 --> 0:1:12,29
Today, I'm going back to the
rice fields of Artibonite to


14
0:1:12,29 --> 0:1:15,95
collect the potions that
Crescent has promised.


15
0:1:15,95 --> 0:1:19,93
I meet with Alex, who fears
Crescent may attempt to rob us


16
0:1:19,93 --> 0:1:22,975
and so has brought his friend
from the special forces.


17
0:1:22,975 --> 0:1:23,736
Hamilton.


18
0:1:23,736 --> 0:1:25,48
SERGE: Serge.


19
0:1:25,48 --> 0:1:28,31
HAMILTON MORRIS: Serge serves
as the personal bodyguard to


20
0:1:28,31 --> 0:1:31,93
the president's sister's
husband.


21
0:1:31,93 --> 0:1:36,66
Alex has brought along a magical
potion to protect us.


22
0:1:36,66 --> 0:1:40,44
Serge has brought a duffel bag
full of guns and takes a


23
0:1:40,44 --> 0:1:43,28
moment before we leave
to hide one under


24
0:1:43,28 --> 0:1:44,54
each seat in the car.


25
0:1:44,54 --> 0:1:49,77



26
0:1:49,77 --> 0:1:54,95
Again, we drive for many hours
and find the roads completely


27
0:1:54,95 --> 0:1:57,85
blocked with a large
funeral procession


28
0:1:57,85 --> 0:1:59,88
supporting a wooden coffin.


29
0:1:59,88 --> 0:2:20,3



30
0:2:20,3 --> 0:2:24,46
As we walk through the fields,
I am facing the unknown.


31
0:2:24,46 --> 0:2:27,32
I have no idea what to
expect from Crescent.


32
0:2:27,32 --> 0:2:30,67
He could give me the poison, or
poison me with the poison,


33
0:2:30,67 --> 0:2:36,37
or shoot me in the
face 14 times.


34
0:2:36,37 --> 0:2:39,19
We are deep in the country, and
should we need help, it


35
0:2:39,19 --> 0:2:41,24
will be unavailable.


36
0:2:41,24 --> 0:2:44,37
At first, I find this
frightening, but I'm comforted


37
0:2:44,37 --> 0:2:47,86
knowing that Alex's lithe, agile
body will be quick to


38
0:2:47,86 --> 0:2:49,36
respond to any threats.

42
0:3:9,355 --> 0:3:12,6
HAMILTON MORRIS: We arrive at
Crescent's, bearing gifts of


43
0:3:12,6 --> 0:3:15,67
Barbancourt rum to show
our goodwill.


44
0:3:15,67 --> 0:3:19,46
He seems pleased, but I'm
anxious to see this new poison


45
0:3:19,46 --> 0:3:23,14
and how it might differ from the
last, seemingly inactive


46
0:3:23,14 --> 0:3:25,58
powder he gave me.


47
0:3:25,58 --> 0:3:26,95
Can we see the powder, then?

HAMILTON MORRIS: Does he
still have any of the


54
0:3:45,57 --> 0:3:46,715
ingredients left over?

can go with him.


60

HAMILTON MORRIS: OK.


61

to let me see if a


66
0:4:12,3 --> 0:4:15,47
laboratory, where he concocts
his leaf medicines.


67
0:4:15,47 --> 0:4:18,98
But he says that I must
accompany him alone, so Alex


68
0:4:18,98 --> 0:4:20,23
stays behind.

ask him what he was

just crushing up?

0:5:26,85 --> 0:5:29,63

Can you ask him if he has
the zombie cucumber?

retrieved from a child's


87
0:6:3,53 --> 0:6:6,5
coffin and presented to me.


88
0:6:6,5 --> 0:6:9,67
I'm delighted to find he's given
not only a poison but


89
0:6:9,67 --> 0:6:11,2
also a new powered antidote.

HAMILTON MORRIS: At last, my
mission is accomplished.


100
0:6:46,832 --> 0:6:51,2
Yet, the man holding the poison
has a face strikingly


101
0:6:51,2 --> 0:6:53,791
similar to the zombie
I saw yesterday.

103

0:6:59,7 --> 0:7:1,64
HAMILTON MORRIS: Would Crescent
make so shameless an


105
0:7:1,64 --> 0:7:3,225
attempt to fool me?

CRESCENT: [SPEAKING CREOLE]


108
0:7:7,93 --> 0:7:27,79



109
0:7:27,79 --> 0:7:30,0
HAMILTON MORRIS: I went to
Haiti to investigate a


110
0:7:30,0 --> 0:7:34,99
mystery, and a mystery is
exactly what I found.


111
0:7:34,99 --> 0:7:38,88
Upon my return to New York,
I bring the powders to the


112
0:7:38,88 --> 0:7:43,29
laboratory of my friend,
Jason Wallach.


113
0:7:43,29 --> 0:7:44,43
Hello.


114
0:7:44,43 --> 0:7:48,28
I've brought some samples of
zombie poison from Haiti.


115
0:7:48,28 --> 0:7:48,75
JASON WALLACH: All right.


116
0:7:48,75 --> 0:7:51,1
We can look and see
what's in these.


117
0:7:51,1 --> 0:7:52,77
HAMILTON MORRIS: He subjects
the powder to extensive


118
0:7:52,77 --> 0:7:54,3
chemical analysis.


119
0:7:54,3 --> 0:7:55,2
JASON WALLACH: Let's say
100 milligrams is


120
0:7:55,2 --> 0:7:56,92
probably good to start.


121
0:7:56,92 --> 0:7:58,76
HAMILTON MORRIS: First filtering
material to find it


122
0:7:58,76 --> 0:8:2,18
contains a large quantity of
sand and numerous unidentified


123
0:8:2,18 --> 0:8:5,3
hairs, likely of goat origin.


124
0:8:5,3 --> 0:8:8,65
The remaining material is then
extracted to detect alkaloids


125
0:8:8,65 --> 0:8:10,576
and run through TLC and GCMS.


126
0:8:10,576 --> 0:8:17,16



127
0:8:17,16 --> 0:8:19,63
When he's finally finished, we
can say that we know for


128
0:8:19,63 --> 0:8:24,41
certain the secret ingredients,
allele alcohol


129
0:8:24,41 --> 0:8:27,9
and methylparaben, two
non-psychoactive chemicals


130
0:8:27,9 --> 0:8:29,68
commonly found in cosmetic
products.


131
0:8:29,68 --> 0:8:32,62



132
0:8:32,62 --> 0:8:35,9
And so our powder is inactive.


133
0:8:35,9 --> 0:8:39,799
Fake is too certain of a word to
use, but pharmacologically


134
0:8:39,799 --> 0:8:43,159
speaking, it's certainly
inactive.


135
0:8:43,159 --> 0:8:47,16
And in terms of TTX content,
the potions Davis collected


136
0:8:47,16 --> 0:8:49,92
were practically inactive
as well.


137
0:8:49,92 --> 0:8:53,79
So what can one make of
an inactive powder?


138
0:8:53,79 --> 0:8:57,19
Within the magical belief system
of Haiti, zombification


139
0:8:57,19 --> 0:9:0,7
would be possible in the absence
of any active drug.


140
0:9:0,7 --> 0:9:4,36
That is to say, the pure power
of their belief in magic could


141
0:9:4,36 --> 0:9:7,25
produce self-induced,
psychological zombification.


142
0:9:7,25 --> 0:9:10,43



143
0:9:10,43 --> 0:9:14,83
I saw a man in a shed, making
some unusual sounds.


144
0:9:14,83 --> 0:9:17,87
Whether his condition was caused
by a Bizango bokor, I


145
0:9:17,87 --> 0:9:20,8
cannot say.


146
0:9:20,8 --> 0:9:23,41
In Haiti, I know the placebo
can take on new heights of


147
0:9:23,41 --> 0:9:25,1
untold potency.


148
0:9:25,1 --> 0:9:28,66
And whether my inactive poison
is truly inactive cannot be


149
0:9:28,66 --> 0:9:33,1
said outside of that strange
Caribbean island.


150
0:9:33,1 --> 0:9:36,32
I watched a man in the throes
of spiritual possession, and


151
0:9:36,32 --> 0:9:39,34
swam with the puffer, and
had a mysterious powder


152
0:9:39,34 --> 0:9:41,79
transdermally applied
to my forearm.


153
0:9:41,79 --> 0:9:45,13
But my search is not yet over.


154
0:9:45,13 --> 0:9:49,4
I promised the goddess Erzulie
that I would return to Haiti.


155
0:9:49,4 --> 0:9:52,64
And I have no intentions of
breaking her vengeful heart.


156
0:9:52,64 --> 0:9:56,14



157

WADE DAVIS: We never could prove
that Narcisse had gone


158
0:9:59,21 --> 0:10:0,37
through this experience.


159
0:10:0,37 --> 0:10:4,8
My research was totally
misinterpreted by the media.


160
0:10:4,8 --> 0:10:8,18
What I had or had not discovered
was always kind of


161
0:10:8,18 --> 0:10:9,59
exaggerated.


162
0:10:9,59 --> 0:10:15,56
I was sent down to Haiti by a
linear, rational, Descartian


163
0:10:15,56 --> 0:10:18,41
scientist, to quote unquote,
"Find the drug that's used to


164
0:10:18,41 --> 0:10:22,42
make zombies." Well, no drug can
make a social phenomena.


165
0:10:22,42 --> 0:10:25,28
And in the end, instead of
finding the drug used to make


166
0:10:25,28 --> 0:10:32,89
zombies, I found myself
investigating the social and


167
0:10:32,89 --> 0:10:36,91
psychological and spiritual and
political and historical


168
0:10:36,91 --> 0:10:39,68
dimensions of a chemical
possibility.


169
0:10:39,68 --> 0:10:43,31
And the whole purpose of the
research, in the end, was not


170
0:10:43,31 --> 0:10:49,48
prove zombies existed, which it
did, but really to take a


171
0:10:49,48 --> 0:10:52,11
phenomena, that as I say, had
been used in this explicitly


172
0:10:52,11 --> 0:10:55,11
racist way and turn it on its
head, make sense of the


173
0:10:55,11 --> 0:10:59,67
sensation, and in doing so, try
to draw attention to the


174
0:10:59,67 --> 0:11:3,41
preconceptions and
misconceptions that we had


175
0:11:3,41 --> 0:11:7,2
about this extraordinary
worldview, of Haitian vodou,


176
0:11:7,2 --> 0:11:10,18
and that this was not a black
magic cult, but this was an


177
0:11:10,18 --> 0:11:12,6
amazingly complex metaphysical
world.
