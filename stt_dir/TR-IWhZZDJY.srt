1
0:0:3,6 --> 0:0:10,34
From the fires of a sun’s birth, twin planets
emerged.


2
0:0:10,34 --> 0:0:13,42
Venus and Earth.


3
0:0:13,42 --> 0:0:27,29
Two roads diverged in our young solar system.
Nature draped one world in the greens and


4
0:0:27,29 --> 0:0:30,88
blues of life.


5
0:0:30,88 --> 0:0:39,99
While enveloping the other in acid clouds,
high heat, and volcanic flows.


6
0:0:39,99 --> 0:0:46,44
Why did Venus take such a disastrous turn?


7
0:0:46,44 --> 0:0:51,96
And what light can Earth’s sister planet
shed on the search for other worlds like our


8
0:0:51,96 --> 0:1:5,509
own?


9
0:1:5,509 --> 0:1:11,479
For as long as we have gazed upon the stars,
they have offered few signs that somewhere


10
0:1:11,479 --> 0:1:17,329
out there are worlds as rich and diverse as
our own.


11
0:1:17,329 --> 0:1:24,46
Recently, though, astronomers have found ways
to see into the bright lights of nearby stars.


12
0:1:24,46 --> 0:1:31,42
They’ve been discovering planets at a rapid
clip, using orbiting observatories like NASA’s


13
0:1:31,42 --> 0:1:41,96
Kepler space telescope, and an array of ground-based
instruments. The count is almost a thousand


14
0:1:41,96 --> 0:1:47,6
and rising.


15
0:1:47,6 --> 0:1:55,569
These alien worlds run the gamut, from great
gas giants many times the size of our Jupiter,


16
0:1:55,569 --> 0:2:3,39
to rocky, charred remnants that burned when
their parent star exploded.


17
0:2:3,39 --> 0:2:9,33
Some have wild elliptical orbits, swinging
far out into space, then diving into scorching


18
0:2:9,33 --> 0:2:17,15
stellar winds.


19
0:2:17,15 --> 0:2:22,28
Still others orbit so close to their parent
stars that their surfaces are likely bathed


20
0:2:22,28 --> 0:2:39,69
in molten rock.


21
0:2:39,69 --> 0:2:45,629
Amid these hostile realms, a few bear tantalizing
hints of water or ice, ingredients needed


22
0:2:45,629 --> 0:2:52,579
to nurture life as we know it.


23
0:2:52,579 --> 0:2:59,11
The race to find other Earths has raised anew
the ancient question, whether, out in the


24
0:2:59,11 --> 0:3:7,75
folds of our galaxy, planets like our own
are abundant, and life commonplace?


25
0:3:7,75 --> 0:3:14,84
Or whether Earth is a rare Garden of Eden
in a barren universe?


26
0:3:14,84 --> 0:3:19,519
With so little direct evidence of these other
worlds to go on, we have only the stories


27
0:3:19,519 --> 0:3:25,89
of planets within our own solar system to
gauge the chances of finding another Earth.


28
0:3:25,89 --> 0:3:33,959
Consider, for example, a world that has long
had the look and feel of a life-bearing planet.


29
0:3:33,959 --> 0:3:39,849
Except for the moon, there’s no brighter
light in our night skies than the planet Venus,


30
0:3:39,849 --> 0:3:44,7
known as both the morning and the evening
star.


31
0:3:44,7 --> 0:3:48,67
The ancient Romans named it for their goddess
of beauty and love.


32
0:3:48,67 --> 0:3:57,299
In time, the master painters transformed this
classical symbol into an erotic figure, then


33
0:3:57,299 --> 0:3:59,939
a courtesan.


34
0:3:59,939 --> 0:4:7,269
It was a scientist, Galileo Galilei, who demystified
planet Venus, charting its phases as it moved


35
0:4:7,269 --> 0:4:12,329
around the sun, drawing it into the ranks
of the other planets.


36
0:4:12,329 --> 0:4:18,73
With a similar size and weight, Venus became
known as Earth’s sister planet. But how


37
0:4:18,73 --> 0:4:22,84
Earth-like is it?


38
0:4:22,84 --> 0:4:30,15
The Russian scientist Mikkhail Lomonosov caught
a tantalizing hint in 1761. As Venus passed


39
0:4:30,15 --> 0:4:35,3
in front of the Sun, he witnessed a hair thin
luminescence on its edge.


40
0:4:35,3 --> 0:4:39,37
Venus, he found, has an atmosphere.


41
0:4:39,37 --> 0:4:44,28
Later observations revealed a thick layer
of clouds. Astronomers imagined they were


42
0:4:44,28 --> 0:4:52,19
made of water vapor, like those on Earth.
Did they obscure stormy, wet conditions below?


43
0:4:52,19 --> 0:5:2,11
And did anyone, or anything, live there? The
answer came aboard an unlikely messenger,


44
0:5:2,11 --> 0:5:6,509
an asteroid that crashed into Earth.


45
0:5:6,509 --> 0:5:26,139
That is, according to the classic sci-fi adventure,
“The First Spaceship on Venus.“ A 
mysterious computer disk is found among the


46
0:5:26,139 --> 0:5:31,3
rubble.


47
0:5:31,3 --> 0:5:42,229
With anticipation rising on Earth, an international
crew sets off to find out who sent it, and


48
0:5:42,229 --> 0:5:43,59
why.


49
0:5:43,59 --> 0:5:53,93
What they find is a treacherous, toxic world.


50
0:5:53,93 --> 0:6:3,86
No wonder the Venusians want to switch planets.


51
0:6:3,86 --> 0:6:11,789
It was now time to get serious about exploring
our sister planet.


52
0:6:11,789 --> 0:6:20,11
NASA sent Mariner 2 to Venus in 1962, in the
first-ever close planetary encounter.


53
0:6:20,11 --> 0:6:25,16
Its instruments showed that Venus is nothing
at all like Earth. Rather, it’s extremely


54
0:6:25,16 --> 0:6:31,97
hot, with an atmosphere made up mostly of
carbon dioxide.


55
0:6:31,97 --> 0:6:39,599
The data showed that Venus rotates very slowly,
only once every 243 Earth days, and it goes


56
0:6:39,599 --> 0:6:44,44
in the opposite direction.


57
0:6:44,44 --> 0:6:50,6
American and Soviet scientists found out just
how strange Venus is when they sent a series


58
0:6:50,6 --> 0:6:54,139
of landers down to take direct readings.


59
0:6:54,139 --> 0:7:0,12
Surface temperatures are almost 900 degrees
Fahrenheit, hot enough to melt lead, with


60
0:7:0,12 --> 0:7:5,99
the air pressure 90 times higher than at sea
level on Earth.


61
0:7:5,99 --> 0:7:13,979
The air is so thick that it’s not a gas,
but a “supercritical fluid.” Liquid CO2.


62
0:7:13,979 --> 0:7:19,5
On our planet, the only naturally occurring
source is in the high-temperature, high-pressure


63
0:7:19,5 --> 0:7:26,58
environments of undersea volcanoes.


64
0:7:26,58 --> 0:7:33,0
The Soviet Venera landers sent back pictures
showing that Venus is a vast garden of rock,


65
0:7:33,0 --> 0:7:37,69
with no water in sight.


66
0:7:37,69 --> 0:7:41,87
In fact, if you were to smooth out the surface
of Venus, all the water in the atmosphere


67
0:7:41,87 --> 0:7:46,72
would be just 3 centimeters deep.


68
0:7:46,72 --> 0:7:58,12
Compare that to Earth, where the oceans would
form a layer 3 kilometers deep.


69
0:7:58,12 --> 0:8:3,58
If you could land on Venus, you’d be treated
to tranquil vistas and sunset skies, painted


70
0:8:3,58 --> 0:8:4,37
in orange hues.


71
0:8:4,37 --> 0:8:11,34
The winds are light, only a few miles per
hour, but the air is so thick that a breeze


72
0:8:11,34 --> 0:8:14,659
would knock you over.


73
0:8:14,659 --> 0:8:20,69
Look up and you’d see fast-moving clouds,
streaking around the planet at 300 kilometers


74
0:8:20,69 --> 0:8:28,53
per hour. These clouds form a dense high-altitude
layer, from 45 to 66 kilometers above the


75
0:8:28,53 --> 0:8:30,22
surface.


76
0:8:30,22 --> 0:8:36,95
The clouds are so dense and reflective that
Venus absorbs much less solar energy than


77
0:8:36,95 --> 0:8:40,7
Earth, even though it’s 30% closer to the
Sun.


78
0:8:40,7 --> 0:8:47,37
These clouds curve around into a pair of immense
planetary hurricanes as the air spirals down


79
0:8:47,37 --> 0:8:53,5
into the cooler polar regions.


80
0:8:53,5 --> 0:8:59,95
Along the equator, they rise in powerful storms,
unleashing bolts of lightning.


81
0:8:59,95 --> 0:9:5,7
Just like earth, these storms produce rain,
only it’s acid rain that evaporates before


82
0:9:5,7 --> 0:9:10,41
it hits the ground.


83
0:9:10,41 --> 0:9:17,72
At higher elevations, a fine mist forms, not
of water but of the rare metal tellurium,


84
0:9:17,72 --> 0:9:23,69
and iron pyrites, known as fool’s gold.


85
0:9:23,69 --> 0:9:34,22
It can form a metallic frost, like snowflakes
in hell.


86
0:9:34,22 --> 0:9:39,55
Scientists have identified around 1700 major
volcanic centers on Venus ranging from lava


87
0:9:39,55 --> 0:9:47,88
domes, and strange features called arachnoids
or coronae, to giant volcanic summits.


88
0:9:47,88 --> 0:9:55,31
The planet is peppered with volcanoes, perhaps
in the millions, distributed randomly on its


89
0:9:55,31 --> 0:10:1,19
surface. Venus is run through with huge cuts
thousands of kilometers long that may well


90
0:10:1,19 --> 0:10:4,7
be lava channels.


91
0:10:4,7 --> 0:10:12,23
Our sister planet is a volcanic paradise,
in a solar system shaped by volcanism.


92
0:10:12,23 --> 0:10:18,709
The largest mountain on Earth, Hawaii’s
Mauna Kea volcano, measures 32,000 feet from


93
0:10:18,709 --> 0:10:22,44
sea floor to summit.


94
0:10:22,44 --> 0:10:29,89
Rising almost three times higher is the mother
of all volcanoes: Olympus Mons on Mars.


95
0:10:29,89 --> 0:10:36,13
Jupiter’s moon Io, is bleeding lava. It’s
produced deep underground by the friction


96
0:10:36,13 --> 0:10:41,6
of rock on rock, caused by the gravitational
pull of its mother planet.


97
0:10:41,6 --> 0:10:48,12
Then there’s Neptune’s moon Triton, with
crystals of nitrogen ice shooting some 10


98
0:10:48,12 --> 0:10:50,47
kilometers above the surface.


99
0:10:50,47 --> 0:10:58,97
Saturn’s moon Titan, with frozen liquid
methane and ammonia oozing into lakes and


100
0:10:58,97 --> 0:11:0,89
swamps.


101
0:11:0,89 --> 0:11:8,91
On our planet, volcanoes commonly form at
the margins of continents and oceans. Here,


102
0:11:8,91 --> 0:11:17,94
the vast slabs of rock that underlie the oceans
push beneath those that bear the continents.


103
0:11:17,94 --> 0:11:24,529
Deep underground, magma mixes with water,
and the rising pressure forces it up in explosive


104
0:11:24,529 --> 0:11:26,74
eruptions.


105
0:11:26,74 --> 0:11:36,12
On Venus, the scene is very different. In
the high-density atmosphere, volcanoes are


106
0:11:36,12 --> 0:11:45,99
more likely to ooze and splatter, sending
rivers of lava flowing down onto the lowlands.


107
0:11:45,99 --> 0:11:52,35
They resemble volcanoes that form at hot spots
like the Hawaiian islands. There, plumes of


108
0:11:52,35 --> 0:12:4,19
magma rise up from deep within the earth,
releasing the pressure in a stream of eruptions.


109
0:12:4,19 --> 0:12:11,42
To see a typical large volcano on Venus, go
to Sappas Mons, at 400 kilometers across and


110
0:12:11,42 --> 0:12:13,57
1.5 kilometers high.


111
0:12:13,57 --> 0:12:19,24
The mountain was likely built through eruptions
at its summit. But as magma reached up from


112
0:12:19,24 --> 0:12:25,32
below, it began to drain out through subsurface
tubes or cracks that formed a web of channels


113
0:12:25,32 --> 0:12:30,38
leading onto the surrounding terrain.


114
0:12:30,38 --> 0:12:35,31
Is Venus, like Earth, still volcanically active?


115
0:12:35,31 --> 0:12:40,86
Finding the answer is a major goal of the
Venus Express mission, launched in 2005 by


116
0:12:40,86 --> 0:12:48,74
the European Space Agency. Armed with a new
generation of high-tech sensors, it peered


117
0:12:48,74 --> 0:12:50,589
through the clouds.


118
0:12:50,589 --> 0:12:55,12
Recording the infrared light given off by
several large mountains, it found that the


119
0:12:55,12 --> 0:12:59,99
summits are brighter than the surrounding
basins. That’s probably because they had


120
0:12:59,99 --> 0:13:5,99
not been subject to as much weathering in
this corrosive environment.


121
0:13:5,99 --> 0:13:13,48
This means that they would have erupted sometime
within the last few hundred thousand years.


122
0:13:13,48 --> 0:13:18,139
If these volcanoes are active now, it’s
because they are part of a deeper process


123
0:13:18,139 --> 0:13:25,1
that shapes our planet as well.


124
0:13:25,1 --> 0:13:30,529
On Earth, the release of heat from radioactive
decay deep in its mantle is what drives the


125
0:13:30,529 --> 0:13:34,6
motion of oceanic and continental plates.


126
0:13:34,6 --> 0:13:43,61
It’s dependent on erosion and other processes
associated with water.


127
0:13:43,61 --> 0:13:49,54
With no water on Venus, the planet’s internal
heat builds to extreme levels, then escapes


128
0:13:49,54 --> 0:13:54,139
in outbreaks of volcanism that may be global
in scope.


129
0:13:54,139 --> 0:13:59,66
This may explain why fewer than a thousand
impact craters have been found on Venus. Anything


130
0:13:59,66 --> 0:14:7,62
older than about 500 million years has literally
been paved over.


131
0:14:7,62 --> 0:14:12,98
So why did Venus diverge so radically from
Earth when it was born in same solar system


132
0:14:12,98 --> 0:14:16,23
and under similar circumstances?


133
0:14:16,23 --> 0:14:21,649
There is growing evidence, still circumstantial,
that Venus may in fact have had a wetter,


134
0:14:21,649 --> 0:14:24,699
more Earth-like past.


135
0:14:24,699 --> 0:14:32,35
One of the most startling findings of the
early Venus missions was the presence of deuterium,


136
0:14:32,35 --> 0:14:40,67
a form of hydrogen, in Venus’ upper atmosphere.
It forms when ultraviolet sunlight breaks


137
0:14:40,67 --> 0:14:43,49
apart water molecules.


138
0:14:43,49 --> 0:14:48,85
Additional evidence recently came to light.
Venus Express trained its infrared sensors


139
0:14:48,85 --> 0:14:54,12
on the planet’s night side, to look at how
the terrain emits the energy captured in the


140
0:14:54,12 --> 0:14:58,88
heat of the day.


141
0:14:58,88 --> 0:15:5,48
This picture is a composite of over a thousand
individual images of Venus’ southern hemisphere.


142
0:15:5,48 --> 0:15:11,769
Higher elevation areas, shown in blue, emit
less heat than the surrounding basins.


143
0:15:11,769 --> 0:15:20,29
That supports a hypothesis that these areas
are made not of lava, but of granite.


144
0:15:20,29 --> 0:15:26,519
On Earth, granite forms in volcanoes when
magma mixes with water. If there’s granite


145
0:15:26,519 --> 0:15:35,38
on Venus, then there may well have been water.


146
0:15:35,38 --> 0:15:40,85
If Earth and Venus emerged together as twin
blue marbles, then at some point, the two


147
0:15:40,85 --> 0:15:46,4
worlds parted company.


148
0:15:46,4 --> 0:15:52,0
Earth developed ways to moderate its climate,
in part by removing carbon dioxide, a greenhouse


149
0:15:52,0 --> 0:15:56,949
gas, from its atmos phere.


150
0:15:56,949 --> 0:16:5,449
Plants, for one, absorb CO2 and release oxygen
in photosynthesis. One square kilometer of


151
0:16:5,449 --> 0:16:13,269
tropical jungle, for example, can take in
several hundred tons of co2 in just a year.


152
0:16:13,269 --> 0:16:19,63
That’s nothing compared to the oceans. In
a year’s time, according to one recent study,


153
0:16:19,63 --> 0:16:26,759
just one square kilometer of ocean can absorb
41 million tons of CO2.


154
0:16:26,759 --> 0:16:32,66
Earth takes in its own share of CO2. When
rainfall interacts with rocks, a chemical


155
0:16:32,66 --> 0:16:43,149
reaction known as “weathering” converts
atmospheric CO2 to carbonate compounds. Runoff


156
0:16:43,149 --> 0:16:55,949
from the land washes it into rivers and the
seas, where they settle into ocean sediments.


157
0:16:55,949 --> 0:17:2,889
With little water and no oceans, Venus has
no good way to remove CO2 from its atmosphere.


158
0:17:2,889 --> 0:17:8,92
Instead, with volcanic eruptions adding more
and more CO2 to the atmosphere, it has trapped


159
0:17:8,92 --> 0:17:17,42
more and more of the sun’s heat in a runaway
greenhouse effect.


160
0:17:17,42 --> 0:17:22,35
Venus is so hot that liquid water simply cannot
survive on the surface.


161
0:17:22,35 --> 0:17:32,28
Nor, it seems, can it last in the upper atmosphere.


162
0:17:32,28 --> 0:17:40,77
The culprit is the Sun. The outer reaches
of its atmosphere, the corona, is made up


163
0:17:40,77 --> 0:17:50,81
of plasma heated to over a million degrees
Celsius. From this region, the sun sends a


164
0:17:50,81 --> 0:17:58,58
steady stream of charged particles racing
out into the solar system.


165
0:17:58,58 --> 0:18:3,71
The solar wind reaches its peak in the wake
of great looping eruptions on the surface


166
0:18:3,71 --> 0:18:22,19
of the Sun, called coronal mass ejections.


167
0:18:22,19 --> 0:18:48,9
The blast wave sweeps by Venus, then heads
out toward Earth.


168
0:18:48,9 --> 0:19:2,5
Our planet is fortified against the solar
blast.


169
0:19:2,5 --> 0:19:9,41
Plumes of hot magma rise and fall in Earth’s
core as it spins, generating a magnetic field


170
0:19:9,41 --> 0:19:12,48
that extends far out into space.


171
0:19:12,48 --> 0:19:18,85
It acts as a shield, deflecting the solar
wind and causing it to flow past.


172
0:19:18,85 --> 0:19:25,52
It’s this protective bubble that Venus lacks.


173
0:19:25,52 --> 0:19:30,1
Venus Express found that these solar winds
are steadily stripping off lighter molecules


174
0:19:30,1 --> 0:19:37,82
of hydrogen and oxygen. They escape the planet
on the night side, then ride solar breezes


175
0:19:37,82 --> 0:19:40,64
on out into space.


176
0:19:40,64 --> 0:19:48,18
All this may be due to Venus’ size, 80%
that of Earth. This prevents the formation


177
0:19:48,18 --> 0:19:53,57
of a solid iron core, and with it the rising
and falling plumes that generate a strong


178
0:19:53,57 --> 0:19:58,97
magnetic field.


179
0:19:58,97 --> 0:20:4,66
There may be another reason too, according
to a theory about the planet’s early years.


180
0:20:4,66 --> 0:20:12,75
A young planet Venus encountered one or more
planet-sized objects, in violent collisions.


181
0:20:12,75 --> 0:20:21,6
The force of these impacts slowed its rotation
to a crawl, and reversed it, reducing the


182
0:20:21,6 --> 0:20:26,8
chances that a magnetic field could take hold.


183
0:20:26,8 --> 0:20:34,82
This theory may have a surprising bearing
on Earth’s own history.


184
0:20:34,82 --> 0:20:44,26
Scientists believe the sun was not always
as hot as it is. In fact, going back several


185
0:20:44,26 --> 0:20:54,82
billion years, it was cool enough that Earth
should have been frozen over.


186
0:20:54,82 --> 0:21:1,56
Because it was not, this is known as the faint
young sun paradox.


187
0:21:1,56 --> 0:21:10,17
Earth’s salvation may well be linked to
Venus’ fate.


188
0:21:10,17 --> 0:21:16,13
The idea is that the Earth occupied an orbit
closer to the Sun, allowing it to capture


189
0:21:16,13 --> 0:21:25,59
more heat. The gravity of two smaller planets
with unstable orbits would have gradually


190
0:21:25,59 --> 0:21:33,98
pushed it out to its present orbit. The pair
would eventually come together, merging to


191
0:21:33,98 --> 0:21:41,12
form the Venus we know.


192
0:21:41,12 --> 0:21:51,0
As dead as Venus is today, it has brought
surprising dividends in the search for life.


193
0:21:51,0 --> 0:21:57,43
On its recent crossing between Earth and the
Sun, astronomers were out in force.


194
0:21:57,43 --> 0:22:2,64
In remote locations where the viewing was
optimal, such as the Svalbard islands north


195
0:22:2,64 --> 0:22:11,83
of Norway. The data gathered here would be
added to that collected by solar telescopes


196
0:22:11,83 --> 0:22:20,31
on the ground and in space.


197
0:22:20,31 --> 0:22:46,37
To object for most was to experience a spectacle
that will not occur again till the year 2117.


198
0:22:46,37 --> 0:22:53,98
It was also to capture sunlight passing through
Venus’ atmosphere.


199
0:22:53,98 --> 0:23:2,5
Today, the Kepler Space Telescope is searching
for planets around distant stars by detecting


200
0:23:2,5 --> 0:23:10,5
dips in their light as a planet passes in
front.


201
0:23:10,5 --> 0:23:16,15
Telescopes in the future may be able to analyze
the light of the planet itself. If elements


202
0:23:16,15 --> 0:23:26,67
such as carbon or oxygen are detected, then
these worlds may well be “Earth-like.”


203
0:23:26,67 --> 0:23:34,99
Venus provides a benchmark, and some valuable
perspective.


204
0:23:34,99 --> 0:23:40,49
So what can we glean from the evolution of
planet Venus?


205
0:23:40,49 --> 0:23:49,7
As we continue to scan the cosmic horizons,
the story of Venus will stand as a stark reminder.


206
0:23:49,7 --> 0:23:57,96
It takes more than just the right size, composition,
and distance from the parent star, for a planet


207
0:23:57,96 --> 0:24:5,11
to become truly Earth-like.


208
0:24:5,11 --> 0:24:11,3
No matter how promising a planet may be, there
are myriad forces out there that can radically


209
0:24:11,3 --> 0:24:13,21
alter its course.


210
0:24:13,21 --> 0:24:23,41
For here was a world, Venus, poised perhaps
on the brink of a glorious future.


211
0:24:23,41 --> 0:24:33,1
But bad luck passed its way. Now, we can only
imagine what might have become of Earth’s


212
0:24:33,1 --> 0:24:33,35
sister planet?


213
0:24:33,35 --> 0:26:33,35
