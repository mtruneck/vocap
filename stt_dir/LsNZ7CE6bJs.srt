1
0:0:1,247 --> 0:0:3,247
- Just let it go?
- No.


2
0:0:3,247 --> 0:0:6,167
Why wouldn't
l wanna go to the symphony?


3
0:0:6,167 --> 0:0:9,287
- l didn't mean anything by it.
- You meant something.


4
0:0:9,287 --> 0:0:12,207
- We've got to do something.
- No, we really don't.


5
0:0:12,207 --> 0:0:15,167
Carla's your girlfriend,
Elliot's my friend...


6
0:0:15,167 --> 0:0:17,407
Trust me. Don't get involved.


7
0:0:17,407 --> 0:0:20,167
She's from <i>el barrio</i>
she must not like music.


8
0:0:20,167 --> 0:0:27,127
- Classical music isn't for everyone.
- So, l didn't have a nanny...


9
0:0:27,127 --> 0:0:29,967
You got something to say?


10
0:0:29,967 --> 0:0:40,527
l think you're being condescending
and you're being overly sensitive.


11
0:0:40,527 --> 0:0:54,767
Excuse me for a second,
just one second.


12
0:0:54,767 --> 0:0:57,407
She's from <i>el barrio</i>
she won't like music.


13
0:0:57,407 --> 0:1:4,367
- Classical music isn't for everyone.
- So, l didn't have a nanny...


14
0:1:4,367 --> 0:1:6,487
You got something to say?


15
0:1:6,487 --> 0:1:9,87
<i>Nope, Not this time,</i>


16
0:1:9,87 --> 0:1:18,447
l think you're being condescending
and you're being overly sensitive.


17
0:1:18,447 --> 0:1:43,287
Dammit!


18
0:1:43,287 --> 0:1:45,367
<i>Here's something surprising,</i>


19
0:1:45,367 --> 0:1:47,687
<i>On my first day</i>
<i>my resident told me</i>


20
0:1:47,687 --> 0:1:51,807
<i>if you don't count the maternity ward</i>
<i>which is mostly well you know</i>


21
0:1:51,807 --> 0:1:53,887
<i>or the emergency room</i>


22
0:1:53,887 --> 0:1:57,287
<i>which is mostly broken bones</i>
<i>stitches that sort of thing</i>


23
0:1:57,287 --> 0:2:0,887
<i>he said that</i>
<i>one out of every three patients</i>


24
0:2:0,887 --> 0:2:5,367
<i>that's admitted to this place</i>
<i>will die here,</i>


25
0:2:5,367 --> 0:2:7,607
Hi, l'm gonna be your doctor.


26
0:2:7,607 --> 0:2:11,527
l'm the doctor.


27
0:2:11,527 --> 0:2:13,207
l'm the doctor.


28
0:2:13,207 --> 0:2:15,407
- What are you, 1 6?
- Unacceptable.


29
0:2:15,407 --> 0:2:17,687
Did you have coupons for this hospital?


30
0:2:17,687 --> 0:2:19,407
That's enough!


31
0:2:19,407 --> 0:2:23,247
Sure, he's young but he's
probably a very good doctor.


32
0:2:23,247 --> 0:2:26,447
- Are you a good doctor?
- Kinda too soon to tell.


33
0:2:26,447 --> 0:2:28,887
Honesty, l like that.


34
0:2:28,887 --> 0:2:31,607
You probably want
these people to wait outside.


35
0:2:31,607 --> 0:2:32,807
That'd be nice.


36
0:2:32,807 --> 0:2:35,207
Make 'em know
you're a man, not a boy.


37
0:2:35,207 --> 0:2:37,287
Would you guys mind...


38
0:2:37,287 --> 0:2:40,807
- l'm fine where l am, thank you.
- Make me.


39
0:2:40,807 --> 0:2:42,287
Do it.


40
0:2:42,287 --> 0:2:44,367
Everybody outta here, now!


41
0:2:44,367 --> 0:2:47,687
- No need to wake up the dead.
- Jeez, snippy.


42
0:2:47,687 --> 0:2:50,7
- Now!
- That was manly.


43
0:2:50,7 --> 0:2:52,607
That's what l'm talking about.


44
0:2:52,607 --> 0:2:56,567
- Want a hard candy?
- Yes, please.


45
0:2:56,567 --> 0:2:59,847
l'd say this is a simple
laparoscopic hernia repair.


46
0:2:59,847 --> 0:3:3,527
This is embarrassing, you guys
are wearing the same outfit.


47
0:3:3,527 --> 0:3:6,127
Don't sweat it.
l'm not wearing pants.


48
0:3:6,127 --> 0:3:8,127
Come on, that was funny.


49
0:3:8,127 --> 0:3:9,567
Great. Moving on.


50
0:3:9,567 --> 0:3:13,647
Where you going? ESPN Classic's
showing the '82 NFC championship.


51
0:3:13,647 --> 0:3:18,487
We could have some nurses over.


52
0:3:18,487 --> 0:3:22,127
l called down and requested
a Spanish-speaking nurse.


53
0:3:22,127 --> 0:3:27,247
No English, huh?


54
0:3:27,247 --> 0:3:30,207
l'm a chunky monkey
from funky town.


55
0:3:30,207 --> 0:3:37,167
- l'll have trouble translating that.
- Oh, good. lt's you.


56
0:3:37,167 --> 0:3:41,367
l admitted this
really neat old lady today.


57
0:3:41,367 --> 0:3:42,647
Neat?


58
0:3:42,647 --> 0:3:45,807
Dude, the 1 930s called
and they want their lingo back.


59
0:3:45,807 --> 0:3:48,87
We had this connection, you know?


60
0:3:48,87 --> 0:3:51,767
No, l don't know. Now please,
let me get my sweat on.


61
0:3:51,767 --> 0:3:55,327
<i>Surgeons generally don't like</i>
<i>to get too close to patients,</i>


62
0:3:55,327 --> 0:4:0,167
<i>Maybe it makes it harder</i>
<i>to cut someone open or too risky,</i>


63
0:4:0,167 --> 0:4:2,927
l feel like you're missing out.
This Mrs Tanner,


64
0:4:2,927 --> 0:4:6,887
she's got this incredible
energy and warmth.


65
0:4:6,887 --> 0:4:9,7
The League of Women Voters called


66
0:4:9,7 --> 0:4:11,767
wanting to know
where to send your membership.


67
0:4:11,767 --> 0:4:14,87
You use that
''somebody called'' joke a lot.


68
0:4:14,87 --> 0:4:17,847
l can't help it.
l got a hernia patient to take care of.


69
0:4:17,847 --> 0:4:21,87
- What's his name?
- His name's Hernia Patient.


70
0:4:21,87 --> 0:4:23,447
But we've gotten close
so l call him Hernia.


71
0:4:23,447 --> 0:4:26,607
He must feel so safe
and taken care of.


72
0:4:26,607 --> 0:4:28,207
Shut up.


73
0:4:28,207 --> 0:4:36,647
l paged Dr Cox and
he should be here any second.


74
0:4:36,647 --> 0:4:38,447
What did she say?


75
0:4:38,447 --> 0:4:42,807
She says it's amazing your fancy
school didn't teach you Spanish,


76
0:4:42,807 --> 0:4:45,967
considering
a third of patients speak it.


77
0:4:45,967 --> 0:4:54,887
Like every doctor here speaks Spanish!


78
0:4:54,887 --> 0:4:56,247
What now, Dr Barbie?


79
0:4:56,247 --> 0:4:59,567
Mrs Guerrero is a lupus patient
with shortage of breath


80
0:4:59,567 --> 0:5:1,767
so l started her on a heparin drip.


81
0:5:1,767 --> 0:5:4,327
- l wanted to run that by you.
- One.


82
0:5:4,327 --> 0:5:5,887
Two.


83
0:5:5,887 --> 0:5:7,327
- Three.
- So, shall l...


84
0:5:7,327 --> 0:5:10,967
lt's really important
you let me get to ten.


85
0:5:10,967 --> 0:5:13,287
- l just thought...
- Listen, cookie.


86
0:5:13,287 --> 0:5:17,127
You've been here over a month.
This is Medicine 1 01 .


87
0:5:17,127 --> 0:5:19,527
l don't want everything run by me.


88
0:5:19,527 --> 0:5:23,167
l don't wanna give my two cents
but if you do want my opinion,


89
0:5:23,167 --> 0:5:27,207
rest assured it will always be
that you're an incredible pain


90
0:5:27,207 --> 0:5:29,887
and every time
l see your Kewpie-Doll face


91
0:5:29,887 --> 0:5:32,447
it just makes me want
to pick you up and shake you


92
0:5:32,447 --> 0:5:35,727
until all the hours
of my life that you've wasted


93
0:5:35,727 --> 0:5:38,7
fall out.


94
0:5:38,7 --> 0:5:39,727
- Now laugh.
- What?


95
0:5:39,727 --> 0:5:49,447
Laugh so that she doesn't
think l'm yelling at you.


96
0:5:49,447 --> 0:5:51,927
How fun was that?


97
0:5:51,927 --> 0:5:53,727
Just initial.


98
0:5:53,727 --> 0:5:58,407
Dr Kelso. l wonder if you could
give me your opinion on a patient?


99
0:5:58,407 --> 0:6:2,607
She's a 7 4-year-old renal failure,
Mrs Tanner.


100
0:6:2,607 --> 0:6:5,687
Of course.
One of our frequent flyers.


101
0:6:5,687 --> 0:6:8,47
- She's a neat lady.
- That's what l said.


102
0:6:8,47 --> 0:6:21,87
Nobody likes a brown nose, son.
Let me see that chart.


103
0:6:21,87 --> 0:6:26,447
Why?


104
0:6:26,447 --> 0:6:29,567
- You put her on diuretics?
- Yeah, l ordered them.


105
0:6:29,567 --> 0:6:37,7
These labs don't look good.
lt's time she got started on dialysis.


106
0:6:37,7 --> 0:6:39,727
You know what you should
do first, kiddo?


107
0:6:39,727 --> 0:6:47,727
- What's that?
- Find her.


108
0:6:47,727 --> 0:6:58,7
Freedom!


109
0:6:58,7 --> 0:7:1,807
''Went to the park.'' She...


110
0:7:1,807 --> 0:7:5,687
She went to the park.


111
0:7:5,687 --> 0:7:8,567
lt's the Catch.
l say ''Catch,'' no response.


112
0:7:8,567 --> 0:7:11,87
How can no one know what the Catch is?


113
0:7:11,87 --> 0:7:13,767
Niners-Cowboys.
Joe Montana to Dwight Clark,


114
0:7:13,767 --> 0:7:16,287
deep in the end zone,
zero time left.


115
0:7:16,287 --> 0:7:17,847
Don't insult me.


116
0:7:17,847 --> 0:7:25,527
lt's the fourth quarter.
Got a minute?


117
0:7:25,527 --> 0:7:28,47
- Sure.
- Cool.


118
0:7:28,47 --> 0:7:31,207
- David, right? l'm Turk.
- What's up?


119
0:7:31,207 --> 0:7:38,767
- Want some lV?
- No, l'm good.


120
0:7:38,767 --> 0:7:40,687
- Mrs Tanner.
- Here's the party.


121
0:7:40,687 --> 0:7:42,567
l don't know about others,


122
0:7:42,567 --> 0:7:46,127
but under my care, you stay in
hospital until l say it's OK to leave.


123
0:7:46,127 --> 0:7:48,247
We saved you a plate.


124
0:7:48,247 --> 0:7:50,447
l don't care about food right now.


125
0:7:50,447 --> 0:7:52,287
<i>Are those smores?</i>


126
0:7:52,287 --> 0:7:57,767
lt's Samantha's fifth birthday.
You're not gonna make me miss this?


127
0:7:57,767 --> 0:8:1,847
Couldn't you have got her a big cake?


128
0:8:1,847 --> 0:8:4,447
l'm gonna order an ABG
just to be safe.


129
0:8:4,447 --> 0:8:7,607
- Don't you think?
- That's probably a good idea.


130
0:8:7,607 --> 0:8:11,967
Teach me to tell her she's doing fine.


131
0:8:11,967 --> 0:8:17,7
Say...


132
0:8:17,7 --> 0:8:25,607
Mrs Guerrero?


133
0:8:25,607 --> 0:8:27,247
lt worked!


134
0:8:27,247 --> 0:8:32,7
Listen, the important thing to remember
is this won't hurt as much as you think.


135
0:8:32,7 --> 0:8:51,607
l'm ready.


136
0:8:51,607 --> 0:8:54,207
You know what, Mrs Tanner...


137
0:8:54,207 --> 0:8:57,167
Just until Samantha
blows out her candles.


138
0:8:57,167 --> 0:8:59,47
What are you gonna wish for?


139
0:8:59,47 --> 0:9:0,727
- A bike?
- Nope.


140
0:9:0,727 --> 0:9:2,167
- A doll house?
- Nope.


141
0:9:2,167 --> 0:9:5,487
How about the ability
to make quick decisions?


142
0:9:5,487 --> 0:9:12,527
- Nope.
- How about this?


143
0:9:12,527 --> 0:9:14,367
- A pony?
- No!


144
0:9:14,367 --> 0:9:18,7
Enough. l don't think
you realise how serious this is.


145
0:9:18,7 --> 0:9:20,647
We need
to be worried about your mother.


146
0:9:20,647 --> 0:9:23,807
Your grandmother, your...


147
0:9:23,807 --> 0:9:26,327
l'm sorry, we haven't met.
l'm Dr Dorian.


148
0:9:26,327 --> 0:9:29,7
- You're very cute.
- Thank you. Come on, let's go.


149
0:9:29,7 --> 0:9:31,847
- Candles are still lit.
- OK.


150
0:9:31,847 --> 0:9:36,87
Here we go. Blow!


151
0:9:36,87 --> 0:9:38,887
l increased the heparin
to 1 ,500 units per hour.


152
0:9:38,887 --> 0:9:40,567
Does that sound like enough?


153
0:9:40,567 --> 0:9:42,567
Should be.


154
0:9:42,567 --> 0:9:45,447
Speaking of heparin,
have you slept with Turk yet?


155
0:9:45,447 --> 0:9:47,767
- What?!
- l'm sorry.


156
0:9:47,767 --> 0:9:51,327
Too personal.


157
0:9:51,327 --> 0:9:54,367
l like to wait.
l like a guy to want it so bad


158
0:9:54,367 --> 0:9:56,847
he thinks he isn't gonna get it ever.


159
0:9:56,847 --> 0:9:59,447
When he's lost the will to live,
l jump him.


160
0:9:59,447 --> 0:10:2,887
- So how long does that take?
- A month, maybe two.


161
0:10:2,887 --> 0:10:4,247
What about you?


162
0:10:4,247 --> 0:10:6,887
l like to use sex as an ice-breaker.


163
0:10:6,887 --> 0:10:9,87
And how's that working out for you?


164
0:10:9,87 --> 0:10:15,687
l guess l don't have what you
would call high self-esteem.


165
0:10:15,687 --> 0:10:19,607
- Let me know when you find the hernia.
- You got it.


166
0:10:19,607 --> 0:10:21,727
- We're so lost.
- We are not lost.


167
0:10:21,727 --> 0:10:23,327
- Go left here.
- lt's right.


168
0:10:23,327 --> 0:10:25,727
You passed his Cooper's ligament.


169
0:10:25,727 --> 0:10:28,527
- Stop and ask for directions.
- You wanna drive?


170
0:10:28,527 --> 0:10:31,807
Cos l will pull over
and let you drive this thing.


171
0:10:31,807 --> 0:10:40,407
Wait a second.
Go back to where you just were.


172
0:10:40,407 --> 0:10:43,407
What is that?


173
0:10:43,407 --> 0:10:49,647
Her O-sat's in the 80s.
And take a look at her heart rate.


174
0:10:49,647 --> 0:10:51,207
Shoot!


175
0:10:51,207 --> 0:10:56,607
That's basically it. Your kidneys aren't
responding to medication any more.


176
0:10:56,607 --> 0:10:59,447
We're gonna
have to start you on dialysis.


177
0:10:59,447 --> 0:11:2,167
l'm not a big fan of dialysis.


178
0:11:2,167 --> 0:11:4,447
We don't really have a choice.


179
0:11:4,447 --> 0:11:7,167
Actually, l do have a choice.


180
0:11:7,167 --> 0:11:10,527
<i>Certain things you never expect</i>
<i>people to say,</i>


181
0:11:10,527 --> 0:11:13,687
l think l'm ready to die.


182
0:11:13,687 --> 0:11:26,607
l've got a ton of bricks for Dr Dorian.


183
0:11:26,607 --> 0:11:48,447
Can l get that pen back?


184
0:11:48,447 --> 0:11:52,87
You're gonna have to
shut your mouth at some point.


185
0:11:52,87 --> 0:11:56,247
Sweetie, l'm 7 4 years old.
l'm ready to go.


186
0:11:56,247 --> 0:11:59,527
With dialysis you could
live another 80 or 90 years.


187
0:11:59,527 --> 0:12:1,607
You're being a little irrational.


188
0:12:1,607 --> 0:12:4,167
- No, l'm not.
- Everybody dies some time.


189
0:12:4,167 --> 0:12:5,807
No, they don't.


190
0:12:5,807 --> 0:12:10,607
Sir, we're really lucky we found
the lymphoma when we did.


191
0:12:10,607 --> 0:12:14,567
Of course. l'll wait till you
get here before l tell David.


192
0:12:14,567 --> 0:12:16,207
See you soon.


193
0:12:16,207 --> 0:12:20,247
l hope you're not using that phone
to make a personal call.


194
0:12:20,247 --> 0:12:24,967
No, that was David Morrison's father.
He's a patient of mine. A good kid.


195
0:12:24,967 --> 0:12:28,167
He sounds terrific. You two
are becoming best pals, huh?


196
0:12:28,167 --> 0:12:31,647
What we should do is the three
of us play a game of stick ball.


197
0:12:31,647 --> 0:12:35,847
All we need is a stick, a ball
and a pocket full of dreams.


198
0:12:35,847 --> 0:12:38,967
Or we could take turns
bowling your patient


199
0:12:38,967 --> 0:12:41,47
down the hallways of my hospital.


200
0:12:41,47 --> 0:12:43,327
- l can explain.
- Spare me.


201
0:12:43,327 --> 0:12:47,927
Spare you. That's good, sir,
cos of the bowling thing.


202
0:12:47,927 --> 0:12:50,607
- You're not making a joke.
- Not at the moment.


203
0:12:50,607 --> 0:12:53,207
He's a good kid and he needed a friend.


204
0:12:53,207 --> 0:12:58,527
Your patients don't need friends,
they need a doctor.


205
0:12:58,527 --> 0:13:2,47
Her BP's dropping. Maybe
it's time to push thrombolytics.


206
0:13:2,47 --> 0:13:5,367
- What would you do?
- That's way out of my league.


207
0:13:5,367 --> 0:13:9,327
She seems to be decompensating
but thrombolytics scare me.


208
0:13:9,327 --> 0:13:13,407
A lot of times the patient bleeds out.


209
0:13:13,407 --> 0:13:18,287
She needs to know what's going on.


210
0:13:18,287 --> 0:13:21,567
l'll be right back.


211
0:13:21,567 --> 0:13:25,447
- She doesn't want dialysis?
- But what does that mean?


212
0:13:25,447 --> 0:13:28,647
lf she declines dialysis,
there is no ethical dilemma.


213
0:13:28,647 --> 0:13:31,447
But what about our duty
to do everything...


214
0:13:31,447 --> 0:13:34,767
''What about our duty...?''


215
0:13:34,767 --> 0:13:37,927
Look, this has nothing
to do with the patient.


216
0:13:37,927 --> 0:13:40,967
This is all about you.
You are afraid of death.


217
0:13:40,967 --> 0:13:43,607
And you can't be. You're in medicine.


218
0:13:43,607 --> 0:13:47,7
You gotta accept that everything
we do here, everything,


219
0:13:47,7 --> 0:13:48,807
is a stall.


220
0:13:48,807 --> 0:13:52,887
We're just trying to keep
the game going, that's it.


221
0:13:52,887 --> 0:13:59,447
But, ultimately,
it always ends up the same way.


222
0:13:59,447 --> 0:14:2,367
- l win.
- Where? l don't see.


223
0:14:2,367 --> 0:14:4,167
Here, diagonally.


224
0:14:4,167 --> 0:14:9,847
Pretty sneaky, Death.


225
0:14:9,847 --> 0:14:13,287
Hope l helped.


226
0:14:13,287 --> 0:14:16,207
Dr Kelso came down on you, huh?


227
0:14:16,207 --> 0:14:19,487
Yeah, but he's got a point.
This is a hospital.


228
0:14:19,487 --> 0:14:22,207
lt's not a playground.


229
0:14:22,207 --> 0:14:26,727
Well, if it isn't the medulla oblongata.
That's about 50 points there.


230
0:14:26,727 --> 0:14:30,447
l won. l'll just take
your fruit cup and be on my way.


231
0:14:30,447 --> 0:14:32,687
l talked to my dad today.


232
0:14:32,687 --> 0:14:34,327
- He's coming out.
- Cool.


233
0:14:34,327 --> 0:14:37,87
And that nurse came by
to shave me again.


234
0:14:37,87 --> 0:14:39,767
- l didn't tell her to do that.
- You didn't?


235
0:14:39,767 --> 0:14:43,687
No. l think she's got a crush on you.


236
0:14:43,687 --> 0:14:58,487
- Come on, dude, what's going on?
- OK, here's the deal.


237
0:14:58,487 --> 0:15:1,7
<i>She's telling her family,</i>


238
0:15:1,7 --> 0:15:24,527
<i>There's nothing that could</i>
<i>make me go in there right now,</i>


239
0:15:24,527 --> 0:15:28,247
- You didn't tell them, did you?
- lt didn't come up.


240
0:15:28,247 --> 0:15:30,967
Look, they don't need that burden.


241
0:15:30,967 --> 0:15:33,767
And they'd give me reasons
to change my mind.


242
0:15:33,767 --> 0:15:37,167
Speaking of which,
l took the liberty of jotting down


243
0:15:37,167 --> 0:15:41,407
a few things l think everybody should do
at least once in their life.


244
0:15:41,407 --> 0:15:45,967
OK, number one: eat a sausage
and pepper hoagie from Enrico's.


245
0:15:45,967 --> 0:15:48,7
l've done that.


246
0:15:48,7 --> 0:15:55,647
Number two: go to Asia.


247
0:15:55,647 --> 0:15:57,247
l'll take that as a yes.


248
0:15:57,247 --> 0:16:7,647
And l'll also check off
''learn a foreign language''.


249
0:16:7,647 --> 0:16:10,167
What happened to
''l'll be right back''?


250
0:16:10,167 --> 0:16:13,847
l can't believe l started to
think l'd been wrong about you.


251
0:16:13,847 --> 0:16:18,287
That woman needs her doctor to tell her
something, anything, and you run away?


252
0:16:18,287 --> 0:16:20,447
Are you even gonna look at me?


253
0:16:20,447 --> 0:16:22,807
l've been deciding what drink to get.


254
0:16:22,807 --> 0:16:27,567
Trying to choose between cherry soda
and ginger ale, and you know what?


255
0:16:27,567 --> 0:16:30,287
lt's a toss-up.
Either way l get a cold drink.


256
0:16:30,287 --> 0:16:34,367
lt would be impossible for me to
kill someone with this decision but...


257
0:16:34,367 --> 0:16:37,647
l still can't make it.


258
0:16:37,647 --> 0:16:40,647
l think l'm in trouble here.


259
0:16:40,647 --> 0:16:42,807
Look...


260
0:16:42,807 --> 0:16:46,767
These kinds of decisions
aren't easy for anyone.


261
0:16:46,767 --> 0:16:50,167
lf it's any consolation,
one of the reasons l never liked you


262
0:16:50,167 --> 0:16:54,247
is you're already better than most
of the doctors that come here.


263
0:16:54,247 --> 0:16:58,447
l kinda liked being the only smart,
strong chick in the joint.


264
0:16:58,447 --> 0:17:1,127
You sort of just complimented me.


265
0:17:1,127 --> 0:17:4,47
A little bit.


266
0:17:4,47 --> 0:17:6,407
OK, l'm gonna have a ginger ale.


267
0:17:6,407 --> 0:17:9,207
Good start.


268
0:17:9,207 --> 0:17:13,407
That clot isn't going anywhere on its
own, so let's push the thrombolytics.


269
0:17:13,407 --> 0:17:15,447
OK.


270
0:17:15,447 --> 0:17:18,87
Here we go.


271
0:17:18,87 --> 0:17:19,887
Go to the top of the Eiffel Tower.


272
0:17:19,887 --> 0:17:24,127
- Done.
- Go to the top of the Meiffel Tower.


273
0:17:24,127 --> 0:17:27,607
- Now you're making stuff up.
- No, l'm not. lt's right here.


274
0:17:27,607 --> 0:17:28,967
Listen, Dr Dorian,


275
0:17:28,967 --> 0:17:33,47
there is not one thing l regret
as l lay here right now.


276
0:17:33,47 --> 0:17:36,407
l'm ready. l really am.


277
0:17:36,407 --> 0:17:39,967
- You have had an amazing life.
- Good. Now we agree.


278
0:17:39,967 --> 0:17:42,847
Aren't there other patients
you need to be seeing?


279
0:17:42,847 --> 0:17:45,167
Me? No, l've been off for two hours.


280
0:17:45,167 --> 0:17:49,287
So with your precious free time,
you've been talking to an old lady.


281
0:17:49,287 --> 0:17:52,167
What about your list?
How many have you done?


282
0:17:52,167 --> 0:17:56,367
For that matter, how many times have you
sat on the grass and done nothing?


283
0:17:56,367 --> 0:17:59,487
You need to start
taking some time for yourself.


284
0:17:59,487 --> 0:18:1,927
Promise me you'll do that.


285
0:18:1,927 --> 0:18:3,967
- l will.
- Good.


286
0:18:3,967 --> 0:18:7,247
Now, get outta here. Go on.


287
0:18:7,247 --> 0:18:17,887
l just wanna check out
a few things before l get going.


288
0:18:17,887 --> 0:18:20,287
Are you OK?


289
0:18:20,287 --> 0:18:23,47
- l'm scared.
- Come here.


290
0:18:23,47 --> 0:18:31,287
Come here.


291
0:18:31,287 --> 0:18:35,767
You're OK.
You'll be just fine.


292
0:18:35,767 --> 0:19:30,607
Not to worry.


293
0:19:30,607 --> 0:19:36,687
l wanted you to know
she went very peacefully.


294
0:19:36,687 --> 0:19:39,687
l know you did everything
you could for my son.


295
0:19:39,687 --> 0:19:48,7
l can't tell you how glad l am
he had a friend here with him.


296
0:19:48,7 --> 0:19:51,447
Don't second-guess yourself.
You made the right call.


297
0:19:51,447 --> 0:19:54,7
You did.


298
0:19:54,7 --> 0:19:55,87
l know.


299
0:19:55,87 --> 0:19:57,167
Your mother's kidney...


300
0:19:57,167 --> 0:20:1,327
<i>They say one out of every three patients</i>
<i>admitted will die here,</i>


301
0:20:1,327 --> 0:20:4,847
<i>But some days</i>
<i>the odds are worse than that,</i>


302
0:20:4,847 --> 0:20:6,967
l'm really sorry.


303
0:20:6,967 --> 0:20:10,327
<i>And on days like that</i>
<i>the best you can hope for</i>


304
0:20:10,327 --> 0:20:16,127
<i>is that you took</i>
<i>something from it,</i>


305
0:20:16,127 --> 0:20:17,927
Hey, l'm Turk.


306
0:20:17,927 --> 0:20:19,87
<i>Anything,</i>


307
0:20:19,87 --> 0:20:22,47
BP's 1 20 over 80.
Let's keep it that way.


308
0:20:22,47 --> 0:20:25,127
<i>Anything at all,</i>


309
0:20:25,127 --> 0:20:27,887
<i>Even if it's just taking</i>
<i>the time to lie on the grass</i>


310
0:20:27,887 --> 0:22:27,887
<i>and think about all the things</i>
<i>you still have left to do,</i>
