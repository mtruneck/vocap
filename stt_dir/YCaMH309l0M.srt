RYAN DUFFY: Whereas in America,
hip-hop long ago


6
0:0:15,17 --> 0:0:18,14
migrated from the ghettos to
the gated communities, in


7
0:0:18,14 --> 0:0:21,8
Venezuela it's all of the guns,
none of the glamour, and


8
0:0:21,8 --> 0:0:22,63
more of the violence.


9
0:0:22,63 --> 0:0:25,58
So we headed back to Petare to
meet up with El Prieto, the


10
0:0:25,58 --> 0:0:27,8
king of Venezuelan hip-hop.

13

RYAN DUFFY: As a former member
of the massively popular


14
0:0:40,87 --> 0:0:43,98
hip-hop collective Guerrilla
Seca, Prieto commands the


15
0:0:43,98 --> 0:0:47,36
respect of Petare and was an
ideal insider tour guide


16
0:0:47,36 --> 0:0:49,305
through the city's most
dangerous slums.


17
0:0:49,305 --> 0:1:0,354



18
0:1:0,354 --> 0:1:2,776
Did you just catch that teenager
with a handgun?


19
0:1:2,776 --> 0:1:4,372
MALE SPEAKER 1: Did
you just see that?


20
0:1:4,372 --> 0:1:5,755
MALE SPEAKER 2: He's
our security.


21
0:1:5,755 --> 0:1:7,6
RYAN DUFFY: Oh, he's
with security.


22
0:1:7,6 --> 0:1:8,49
All right.


23
0:1:8,49 --> 0:1:9,47
Don't worry.


24
0:1:9,47 --> 0:1:12,16
The teenager with the handgun
is our security apparently.


25
0:1:12,16 --> 0:1:16,79



26
0:1:16,79 --> 0:1:19,38
We headed up to El Prieto's
house where his underage


27
0:1:19,38 --> 0:1:23,595
security detail was
standing guard.


28
0:1:23,595 --> 0:1:24,56
How are you doing?


29
0:1:24,56 --> 0:1:25,81
I'll shake that hand without
the gun in it.


30
0:1:25,81 --> 0:1:28,155



31
0:1:28,155 --> 0:1:30,46
Can you talk a little bit about
the way that growing up


32
0:1:30,46 --> 0:1:33,0
here has influenced
your music career?

RYAN DUFFY: Sorry, that little
child has a huge gun.


36
0:1:57,31 --> 0:2:0,56
Right behind that wall.


37
0:2:0,56 --> 0:2:1,675
Sorry, it's a little
bit distracting.

I'm used to


40
0:2:4,23 --> 0:2:5,33
seeing all the time.


41
0:2:5,33 --> 0:2:6,19
I understand it's different
for you.

50

RYAN DUFFY: Considering all
the 13-year-olds we saw


51
0:3:34,76 --> 0:3:37,65
carrying guns, this seemed like
a reasonable prediction.


52
0:3:37,65 --> 0:3:40,95
Before we left, Prieto quieted
the streets so he could show


53
0:3:40,95 --> 0:3:42,19
off his freestyle skills.

RYAN DUFFY: Prieto's optimism
was a nice closing note.


61
0:4:22,9 --> 0:4:24,93
But he was also flanked
by a bunch of guys


62
0:4:24,93 --> 0:4:26,69
with guns at the time.


63
0:4:26,69 --> 0:4:29,69
While all these guns look great
in his music videos, in


64
0:4:29,69 --> 0:4:32,71
the streets of Caracas they're
a terrifying reminder of


65
0:4:32,71 --> 0:4:36,5
Venezuela's epidemic of
violence, and could very well


66
0:4:36,5 --> 0:4:38,52
be the undoing of Chavez's
socialist revolution.
