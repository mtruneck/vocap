###22 HAMILTON MORRIS: Today is Queen's Day in Amsterdam, and
###24 I have three containers of
###26 psilocybin-containing truffles.
###28 I'm going to start by taking 8 grams of this 15-gram
###31 container, because that's what the man at the smart shop
###34 advised me to do.
###36 And then I suppose I'm going to go out and walk around on
###40 Queen's Day, which is incredibly chaotic and
###43 disgusting.
###44 And probably the worst possible place to take them.
###48 
###53 [SIGHING]
###54 This is the first time I've ever consumed
###57 a psychedelic truffle.
###58 You can't really get these in the United
###60 States as far as I know.
###62 It's actually much less of a mushroom.
###66 It doesn't seem like very much at all.
###68 
###71 OK.
###73 
###92 Yesterday, I arrived in Amsterdam, doubtlessly one of
###96 the sickest places on Earth to get blazed on dank nugs.
###100 
###106 But my interest is not solely confined to blazing dank nugs.
###111 Amsterdam is fertile ground for all manner of
###113 psychoactive substance.
###114 
###121 I came here to find the psilocybe tampanensis
###124 sclerotium, or philosopher's stone truffle.
###128 It was not until the infamous mushroom ban of 2008 that the
###132 psychedelic sclerotium gained widespread popularity, due to
###136 the fact that its effects and chemical composition are
###139 almost indistinguishable from the psilocybin mushroom.
###144 Mushrooms were once completely legal.
###146 And since the early '90s, the Netherlands led the world in
###149 the development of commercial psychedelic mushroom-growing
###151 techniques.
###153 But everything changed in 2008, when the Dutch
###156 government banned psilocybin-containing
###158 mushrooms, responding to a number of highly publicized
###162 deaths misguidedly blamed on the innocent fungus.
###167 Truffles escaped the ban unscathed and hold a place
###171 inside the hearts of all true Dutch.
###174 I am here to learn about how these strange protuberances
###177 are cultivated and why they have not been banned.
###181 There are no better people to consult than the Truffle
###183 Brothers, two of the world's leading experts in the mass
###187 production of psychedelic sclerotia.
###188 
###192 I visited the brothers' farm in Hazerwoude-Dorp, formerly
###196 the second-largest mushroom farm in the Netherlands.
###199 
###203 Having survived the mushroom ban, the Truffle Brothers now
###206 dominate the
###207 psilocybin-containing fungus industry.
###210 I sat down with Murat and Ali to discuss the secrets of the
###214 philosopher's stone.
###216 
###218 ALI: First of all, my name is Ali.
###222 Next to me is sitting my brother, Murat.
###224 We are, in fact, known as the Truffle Brothers.
###228 You are here at the farm of magictruffles.com.
###232 We produce sclerotia, also known as magic truffles.
###237 HAMILTON MORRIS: And how did this company get started?
###240 ALI: Interesting story.
###242 Long story that started somewhere around
###245 1993, '94, I guess.
###249 I learned mushroom growing in Belgium.
###251 Mushrooms for eating-- normal, white button mushrooms.
###254 That was my occupation before I
###255 started with these mushrooms.
###257 And so I had quite a great network in that
###260 area, in that field.
###262 And one day, a friend of mine comes up to me and says, look
###265 what I found.
###268 He shows me a Petri dish with spores.
###272 That's interesting, what kind of mushroom is it?
###275 He said, well, it's a magic mushroom.
###278 And I'd never heard of it.
###280 So I took a closer look.
###282 I went to a friend of mine who owned a laboratory, a
###286 mycological laboratory, and asked him, can we do something
###290 with these spores?
###291 He says, well, let's give it a try.
###292 And after two weeks, there was one mushroom in the aquarium.
###295 But it was a giant mushroom.
###296 It was about [INAUDIBLE]
###299 this tall.
###301 And we were looking at it.
###303 I said, OK, let's harvest it.
###306 HAMILTON MORRIS: And you were operating a pizza restaurant
###308 beforehand, you said?
###309 MURAT: At that time, yes.
###313 HAMILTON MORRIS: The life cycle of a mushroom begins
###314 when two spores of opposite mating types germinate in a
###318 growth substrate and send out threads called "hyphae." The
###322 hyphae form a clamp connection where genetic information is
###325 exchanged and then expand into a web of undifferentiated
###328 threads called "mycelium." If the conditions are right, the
###332 mycelium organizes itself into a mushroom with special
###336 reproductive cells called basidia, which catapult spores
###339 into the air and give rise to new mushrooms.
###343 And you bought this property?
###345 MURAT: Not in the first place.
###348 ALI: First of all, we were in the--
###349 MURAT: We started in my place, in the bedroom of my daughter.
###353 With several aquaria this time.
###355 After the one aquarium, I started to get our aquariums.
###358 ALI: Start searching on the street at night and people
###360 were throwing out their old aquariums.
###362 Yeah, there's one.
###363 Let's take it.
###364 MURAT: My daughter's room was filled with, I think, about 12
###368 aquaria
###369 ALI: Something like that.
###369 MURAT: Or something.
###370 And we started to grow mushrooms in there.
###372 Then we rented our first place, in a town called
###375 Leiderdorp, not far from here.
###377 We made some sheds out of plastic foil
###380 with shelves in it.
###381 And there we started our first professional growth.
###385 ALI: Yeah, yeah.
###386 Right after that, we moved to a bigger plays with ten
###389 growing houses.
###390 MURAT: But it wasn't enough.
###391 The demand was so high that we
###393 couldn't make enough mushrooms.
###396 ALI: And then we saw this, which was far more ideal.
###399 HAMILTON MORRIS: And what were you growing--
###401 What sorts of mushrooms were you growing before the
###403 mushroom ban?
###404 MURAT: We had several species of the psilocybe cubensis.
###409 And the panaeolus cyanescens.
###411 HAMILTON MORRIS: And that was what you
###412 sold more than anything?
###413 More than the truffles you sold?
###414 MURAT: Yes.
###415 Truffles were just for the connoisseur.
###418 It was a side project in that time.
###420 
###425 HAMILTON MORRIS: To better understand the prohibition of
###428 the sacred mushroom, I go to meet criminal lawyer Karem
###432 Canatan, who explained the nuances of Dutch drug law.
###437 KAREM CANATAN: OK.
###438 Well, first of all, like many countries, we have class A
###442 drugs and class B drugs.
###444 So that that's not different from any other countries.
###446 So we have lists of drugs that are illegal--
###450 to buy it, to use it, to bring it over the border to trade.
###455 It's completely illegal.
###457 Then we have a small portion of drugs--
###460 in Holland, we call it the "soft drugs"-- where you have
###463 weed and hashish and the joints.
###467 Or we call it joints, because we smoke joints.
###469 I don't know if that's the correct term, but we have
###474 which is called like a tolerance policy by the Dutch
###478 government.
###479 And they have on paper saying that if the amount isn't
###482 bigger than so-and-so much, then it's allowed to have it,
###487 it's allowed to smoke it, and you are allowed to sell it.
###491 So up until around 2007, it was OK to
###496 use the magic mushrooms.
###499 HAMILTON MORRIS: These were the salad days for mushrooms.
###501 But a series of unfortunate incidents where mentally ill
###504 tourists hurt themselves turned politicians against the
###507 sacred mushroom.
###508 And they began to legislate a ban.
###510 [SPEAKING DUTCH]
###511 
###517 HAMILTON MORRIS: And there had been scattered mushroom
###518 incidents in Amsterdam for decades, it was not until the
###522 death of a 17-year-old French student named Gaelle Caroff
###525 that lawmakers began taking serious steps towards banning
###529 the sale and consumption of psychedelic mushrooms.
###531 [SPEAKING DUTCH]
###532 
###546 [SPEAKING FRENCH]
###547 
###558 HAMILTON MORRIS: After the incident with
###560 Gaelle, others followed.
###563 A Frenchman, supposedly under the influence of mushrooms,
###566 ritualistically sacrificed his dog with a pair of kitchen
###570 shears in order to free the dog's mind from
###573 its corporeal shackles.
###575 [SPEAKING DUTCH]
###576 
###586 ALI: He said, well, I was on mushrooms.
###588 He had psychosis.
###590 And it had nothing to do with mushrooms.
###591 He wasn't even close to mushrooms.
###594 Since these products are legal in this country, it's very
###599 easy to hide yourself behind it.
###601 [SHOUTING IN DUTCH]
###603 
###606 HAMILTON MORRIS: With prohibition looming on the
###607 horizon, protesters swarmed the parliament building, armed
###611 with Super Soakers filled with psychedelic mushroom spores,
###614 which they used to spray the surrounding parks and lawns.
###618 They demanded their right to consume mushrooms.
###621 But parliament ruled in favor of the ban.
###624 So in 2008 they banned all of these
###626 different genus and species.
###628 KAREM CANATAN: Yeah.
###629 Well, part of them were already on it.
###632 But especially this list from here.
###635 The magic mushroom list.
###637 And it says here that magic mushrooms are mushrooms who
###641 have by nature these and these active ingredients.
###645 And then all these species are on the list.
###650 ALI: The law changed in 2008--
###652 1st of December, 2008.
###654 Sad day.
###655 Saddest day of my life.
###656 
###661 HAMILTON MORRIS: How much time did they give you after the
###663 ban to get rid of your stock of mushrooms?
###666 MURAT: 10 days.
###668 ALI: 10 days to clear 16 growing houses, all the
###672 equipment, and so on.
###674 HAMILTON MORRIS: And you were saying all these other
###675 different bans have been given enormous amounts of time,
###678 years before they have to--
###680 ALI: Mink farms, for instance.
###683 They got 10 years to change the plans.
###685 HAMILTON MORRIS: 10 years?
###686 ALI: 10 years.
###687 HAMILTON MORRIS: And you got ten days.
###688 ALI: 10 days.
###689 Look at that.
###691 HAMILTON MORRIS: How did you get rid of the mushrooms?
###693 ALI: That was the easiest part, because people were
###696 lined up here.
###697 the last mushrooms, the last mushrooms.
###701 HAMILTON MORRIS: Despite the chemical and biological
###703 similarity to the mushroom, parliament decided not to ban
###706 the magic truffle.
###708 ALI: When the law changed in 2008, we just continued with
###712 the truffles that we were already growing in that time.
###716 HAMILTON MORRIS: So what is a truffle?
###717 And how is it different from a mushroom?
###721 MURAT: [INAUDIBLE]
###722 for nutrients and moisture.
###725 HAMILTON MORRIS: Like all organisms, a
###727 fungus seeks to reproduce.
###729 But environmental conditions are not always ideal to do so.
###733 If the substrate is too dry, cold, hot, or poor in
###736 nutrients, the mycelium will grow inwards, forming a
###740 tangled clump of globular fungus called a sclerotium.
###744 These hard structures are able to survive in harsh
###747 environmental conditions until the time is right to send
###751 forth mushrooms.
###752 
###754 Murat offered to give me a guided tour of their
###757 innovative sclerotium cultivation facilities.
###762 MURAT: We'll start where it all begins.
###764 That's the dirty side where all raw materials come in.
###769 
###774 HAMILTON MORRIS: First, the rye grass seed substrate is
###777 sterilized in an industrial-sized autoclave to
###780 kill opportunistic bacteria and fungi, which are equally
###783 eager to consume the bags of warm, moist nutrients.
###786 
###793 Then the bags are inoculated with a
###795 liquid culture of mycelium.
###798 MURAT: This is a class 100 cleanroom.
###800 That means that only 100 particles of 0.00096 micron
###807 may be present in one cubic feet of air.
###810 Normally in an operating room it's class 10,000, so 10,000
###814 particles may appear in a cubic foot of air.
###819 HAMILTON MORRIS: Impressive.
###820 ALI: If you do everything, like your laboratory work and
###823 your growing, under one roof, you get a cross-contamination
###826 somewhere, somehow.
###827 And that risk was so big that we looked for a proper
###831 building with at least two separate departments.
###835 HAMILTON MORRIS: Then the bags are transported to an
###837 incubation chamber, where a temperature of 28 degrees
###840 Celsius is maintained to accelerate the colonization of
###844 the substrate.
###845 How do you prevent the growth of mushrooms?
###848 MURAT: By controlling the temperature and the
###850 microclimate in the bag.
###852 The microclimate in the bag is not suitable for
###855 formation of mushrooms.
###858 HAMILTON MORRIS: The final stage is the nursery, where
###860 the bags are kept in darkness for as many as five months
###863 before the sclerotia are mature.
###866 And what is the capacity of this plant at the moment?
###870 MURAT: Full capacity, if we worked 24 hours a day in three
###875 shifts, 18,000 tons per year.
###878 ALI: Something like that, yeah.
###880 HAMILTON MORRIS: 18,000 tons?
###880 ALI: Yes.
###881 MURAT: Yeah.
###882 MURAT: I think that sclerotia, to go for the mushroom market
###885 one-on-one, by now--
###887 ALI: By now it's one-on-one, yeah.
###890 HAMILTON MORRIS: Upon maturity, the bags are opened
###893 the sclerotia are plucked from their substrate, cleaned with
###896 a soft-bristled brush, and packaged for distribution.
###900 It seems your brand is the only brand, except for one
###903 another that I saw, that you can get at
###905 smart shops in Amsterdam.
###906 MURAT: Yeah.
###907 That might be correct.
###907 There are some home growers, but as far as commercially
###910 grown sclerotia, I think we're the largest.
###913 HAMILTON MORRIS: Do you have any competitors?
###916 MURAT: Everyone who grows a truffle is a competitor.
###919 HAMILTON MORRIS: Ah.
###920 Each package contains a single serving of fresh,
###924 psilocybin-containing sclerotia.
###926 MURAT: We deliver them to the shop in boxes of 24.
###931 We give the shops 24 booklets so that people get the proper
###935 information.
###936 HAMILTON MORRIS: Good.
###938 
###944 Murat invited me to join him on his delivery route and
###947 visit the magic truffle storefront in Amsterdam.
###949 
###957 The Dutch countryside touched us both deeply, but we could
###960 not linger on these natural delights.
###963 We had important sclerotium deliveries to make.
###966 
###969 One of the stops was a wholesale psychedelics
###972 distributor specializing in peyote cacti.
###975 
###979 We finally made it to the shop, and not a minute too
###982 soon as the hoards of truffle-hungry Dutch waited
###985 eagerly for their Queen's Day delights.
###988 [BACKGROUND CHATTER]
###998 HAMILTON MORRIS: Chills and Thrills was not the truffle
###1001 theme park I was expecting, but I knew the real ride would
###1005 come later.
###1007 SPEAKER 1: you?
###1008 HAMILTON MORRIS: I'm good.
###1009 I would like to buy some P. Tampanensis.
###1013 SPEAKER 1:
###1015 HAMILTON MORRIS: Thank you.
###1016 SPEAKER 1: you.
###1018 Enjoy.
###1021 HAMILTON MORRIS: The truffles require no preparation.
###1024 And thought the truffle brothers recommended a
###1026 truffle-based milkshake, I chose to take them raw so that
###1030 I could savor their essences.
###1031 
###1038 That's not bad at all.
###1039 It's actually kind of good.
###1042 Well.
###1044 
###1046 It has almost a sour aftertaste, but sour is the
###1051 last taste I would associate with a truffle.
###1056 
###1067 Do you want some truffle crumbs?
###1070 Scarf them down.
###1073 Mmm.
###1075 Tastes pretty darn--
###1077 uh, like a wet nut.
###1079 This is a drug?
###1082 This is a drug?
###1083 This is technically a drug?
###1086 All right.
###1087 
###1100 KAREM CANATAN: Well, I don't have any
###1101 experience with the truffles.
###1103 But if it's not a health risk and it doesn't have any other
###1107 negative side effects, I would say allow it.
###1111 And then make sure you can control it.
###1114 HAMILTON MORRIS: What sort of person
###1115 buys psychedelic truffles?
###1118 MURAT: I don't think there's a specific type of person.
###1121 Age has nothing to do with it.
###1123 We've had people in their 80s coming for mushrooms.
###1129 ALI: Yeah, or people who are curious for the experience who
###1132 think there's more in life than the
###1137 regular things we see.
###1138 And there's also the real cosmonauts, who use it for the
###1143 real spiritual thing, like the shamanic experiences.
###1147 HAMILTON MORRIS: What category would you put yourselves into?
###1151 ALI: None.
###1153 HAMILTON MORRIS: None?
###1155 You don't use your own product?
###1156 ALI: No.
###1158 MURAT: Bummer.
###1160 
###1180 HAMILTON MORRIS: While the Mazatec Indians prescribed
###1183 special conditions under which the sacred mushroom should be
###1186 consumed, there exist little-known rituals
###1189 surrounding the psychedelic sclerotium.
###1192 Their history remains unwritten.
###1196 Though I feel sweaty and overwhelmed by the chaos of
###1199 Queen's Day, I feel no compulsion to ritualistically
###1202 stab a dog and play with its internal organs in a van.
###1206 Nor do I wish to jump off a bridge to a watery death.
###1211 I'm glad that the resilient structure of the sclerotium
###1213 has survived the inhospitable environment of prohibition.
###1217 And I hope that it sends forth mycelial threads of liberty
###1221 for many years to come.
###1222
