1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:4,78



2
0:0:4,78 --> 0:0:5,14
LAL HARDY: Ay, he's a mad boy.


3
0:0:5,14 --> 0:0:6,39
Come in here, you!


4
0:0:6,39 --> 0:0:8,71



5
0:0:8,71 --> 0:0:10,336
What you doing here?


6
0:0:10,336 --> 0:0:11,95
SPEAKER 1: I've come to
show you something.


7
0:0:11,95 --> 0:0:15,83



8
0:0:15,83 --> 0:0:17,36
That's what I wanted
to show you.


9
0:0:17,36 --> 0:0:19,64
[LAUGHTER]


10
0:0:19,64 --> 0:0:19,84
LAL HARDY: Look at that!


11
0:0:19,84 --> 0:0:22,171
He's got a picture of me
tattooed, the idiot.


12
0:0:22,171 --> 0:0:24,937
[LAUGHTER]


13
0:0:24,937 --> 0:0:26,95
LAL HARDY: Fucking hell, man.


14
0:0:26,95 --> 0:0:29,56
Go and get it and bring
it out here.


15
0:0:29,56 --> 0:0:30,31
SPEAKER 2: That's the only
reason he got it done.


16
0:0:30,31 --> 0:0:32,34
LAL HARDY: I didn't even know
he'd had that done.


17
0:0:32,34 --> 0:0:33,767
That's pretty freaky,
you know?


18
0:0:33,767 --> 0:0:37,11



19
0:0:37,11 --> 0:0:39,17
VALERIE VARGAS: I think when
we first started, Dad


20
0:0:39,17 --> 0:0:41,58
introduced us to him because
Lal's a pretty really level


21
0:0:41,58 --> 0:0:42,2
headed kind of guy.


22
0:0:42,2 --> 0:0:43,31
He's own a shop for
a long time.


23
0:0:43,31 --> 0:0:45,21
He's been in the business
for a long time.


24
0:0:45,21 --> 0:0:48,55
He's pretty much the perfect
guy to ask anything to.


25
0:0:48,55 --> 0:0:53,1
It's something really strange
that kind of happens with Lal


26
0:0:53,1 --> 0:0:54,73
and people like even
[INAUDIBLE]


27
0:0:54,73 --> 0:0:56,93
and they've been in this
game for so long.


28
0:0:56,93 --> 0:0:58,64
And they're still so stoked
on tattooing.


29
0:0:58,64 --> 0:0:59,82
They're not burnt out at all.


30
0:0:59,82 --> 0:1:0,63
They don't hate people.


31
0:1:0,63 --> 0:1:1,82
They don't hate customers.


32
0:1:1,82 --> 0:1:3,34
They don't hate tattooing.


33
0:1:3,34 --> 0:1:6,7
He's super open, super nice
and I really like


34
0:1:6,7 --> 0:1:6,83
his sense of humor.


35
0:1:6,83 --> 0:1:11,825
He's got a really cheeky sense
of humor which I like.


36
0:1:11,825 --> 0:1:14,61
LAL HARDY: This flipper belonged
to a tattooist who


37
0:1:14,61 --> 0:1:16,92
was killed by a shark.


38
0:1:16,92 --> 0:1:19,5
And then we had another one
which was a customer that


39
0:1:19,5 --> 0:1:24,35
didn't pay so we cut their
nipple off as a punishment.


40
0:1:24,35 --> 0:1:26,255
Somebody asks me-- they didn't
have enough money for a


41
0:1:26,255 --> 0:1:29,43
tattoo-- so they said, could
they pay with this.


42
0:1:29,43 --> 0:1:32,7
That's what we want.


43
0:1:32,7 --> 0:1:33,97
Every shop needs a musket.


44
0:1:33,97 --> 0:1:35,22
There's another one.


45
0:1:35,22 --> 0:1:38,47



46
0:1:38,47 --> 0:1:40,8
My name's Lal Hardy.


47
0:1:40,8 --> 0:1:43,61
I'm a tattoo artist in Muzzle
Hill, which is a suburb of


48
0:1:43,61 --> 0:1:44,71
North London.


49
0:1:44,71 --> 0:1:47,35
And I've been tattooing now--


50
0:1:47,35 --> 0:1:52,26
well I probably got involved in
the industry around 1975.


51
0:1:52,26 --> 0:1:54,43
And the rest is history,
really.


52
0:1:54,43 --> 0:1:57,61
Been in this shop ever since.


53
0:1:57,61 --> 0:2:0,44
Tattooing in the 1980s in
London was quite an


54
0:2:0,44 --> 0:2:2,12
interesting time.


55
0:2:2,12 --> 0:2:3,8
A few things happened
in this country.


56
0:2:3,8 --> 0:2:5,12
Punk rock came along.


57
0:2:5,12 --> 0:2:7,8
And I started to tattoo a
lot of the punk rockers.


58
0:2:7,8 --> 0:2:10,22
And they'd bring in
record sleeves.


59
0:2:10,22 --> 0:2:12,65
And I was doing that and got
a bit of publicity for it.


60
0:2:12,65 --> 0:2:15,94
And I'd written a thing for
Ed Hardy's tattoo in Time


61
0:2:15,94 --> 0:2:20,446
Magazine and I was getting
some recognition.


62
0:2:20,446 --> 0:2:24,27
I used to have my hair all
different colors and I just


63
0:2:24,27 --> 0:2:27,14
used to love punk rock girls
and skinhead girls.


64
0:2:27,14 --> 0:2:28,56
You know?


65
0:2:28,56 --> 0:2:29,53
That was just--


66
0:2:29,53 --> 0:2:30,23
I loved it.


67
0:2:30,23 --> 0:2:34,15
I like the kind of nonconformist
way that they


68
0:2:34,15 --> 0:2:36,33
used to look.


69
0:2:36,33 --> 0:2:38,8
And that was kind of an
interesting time to grow up to


70
0:2:38,8 --> 0:2:40,79
in the punk rock era.


71
0:2:40,79 --> 0:2:42,4
There was a whole movement,
wasn't it?


72
0:2:42,4 --> 0:2:44,112
And now it's just rubbish,
really, when


73
0:2:44,112 --> 0:2:45,1
you think about it.


74
0:2:45,1 --> 0:2:45,62
It's like everything.


75
0:2:45,62 --> 0:2:45,9
You know?


76
0:2:45,9 --> 0:2:48,23
You think you're going to
change the world but


77
0:2:48,23 --> 0:2:50,285
ultimately you don't.


78
0:2:50,285 --> 0:2:52,15
SPEAKER 3: When I went to Good
Time Charlie's, one of the


79
0:2:52,15 --> 0:2:53,87
biggest kicks I got
was seeing Jeff


80
0:2:53,87 --> 0:2:56,3
Harp's Sid Vicious tattoo.


81
0:2:56,3 --> 0:2:59,7
LAL HARDY: I've got a Sid
Vicious done on me as well.


82
0:2:59,7 --> 0:3:0,96
But really--


83
0:3:0,96 --> 0:3:2,25
SPEAKER 3: Where's
your Sidney?


84
0:3:2,25 --> 0:3:3,5
LAL HARDY: Sid's under there.


85
0:3:3,5 --> 0:3:5,65



86
0:3:5,65 --> 0:3:9,84
I mean, when I think back to
people still coming in and


87
0:3:9,84 --> 0:3:13,7
just saying, mate, you were so
crazy when you were younger.


88
0:3:13,7 --> 0:3:15,7
In a way, the old time
tattooist had to


89
0:3:15,7 --> 0:3:16,95
be a bit of a showman.


90
0:3:16,95 --> 0:3:20,2
Like just get on the counter
and do a dance or something


91
0:3:20,2 --> 0:3:21,69
ridiculous.


92
0:3:21,69 --> 0:3:25,29
Come downstairs dressed
in a pantomime outfit.


93
0:3:25,29 --> 0:3:26,94
Just crazy silly things.


94
0:3:26,94 --> 0:3:30,47
But that's because back
then, you had to


95
0:3:30,47 --> 0:3:31,64
fight for your work.


96
0:3:31,64 --> 0:3:34,22
You had to A, be doing stuff
that was a bit different, but


97
0:3:34,22 --> 0:3:37,2
you wanted people to come for
the experience as well.


98
0:3:37,2 --> 0:3:39,94
I've got to say, I've got
a million and one


99
0:3:39,94 --> 0:3:42,49
stories and lived it.


100
0:3:42,49 --> 0:3:45,59
I feel that for some of the
young people, they've got


101
0:3:45,59 --> 0:3:48,57
their own way of entertainment
now, but they ain't had a guy


102
0:3:48,57 --> 0:3:52,0
turn up in an army tank stark
naked, fire a distress flare


103
0:3:52,0 --> 0:3:52,91
up the street.


104
0:3:52,91 --> 0:3:54,19
We had a big tree up here.


105
0:3:54,19 --> 0:3:56,79
Another guy'd take all his
clothes off, climb up the


106
0:3:56,79 --> 0:3:59,103
tree, sitting up there
just because he


107
0:3:59,103 --> 0:3:59,96
thought he was funny.


108
0:3:59,96 --> 0:4:1,905
Even in my shop, here, I
was mad on greyhounds.


109
0:4:1,905 --> 0:4:2,91
SPEAKER 4: Yeah.


110
0:4:2,91 --> 0:4:4,975
LAL HARDY: I had a running
machine, electric roadway,


111
0:4:4,975 --> 0:4:8,37
that I used to stand a dog on so
that the dog could get fit


112
0:4:8,37 --> 0:4:10,23
when I was tattooing.


113
0:4:10,23 --> 0:4:12,32
There used to be a massive
psychiatric hospital across


114
0:4:12,32 --> 0:4:13,14
the road as well.


115
0:4:13,14 --> 0:4:15,73
So sometimes, you'd get people
coming in that you had to sort


116
0:4:15,73 --> 0:4:18,17
of direct out the shop.


117
0:4:18,17 --> 0:4:21,269
It keeps you young at heart if
you let it, this business.


118
0:4:21,269 --> 0:4:23,36
That's one of the funny things
about tattooing.


119
0:4:23,36 --> 0:4:26,23
You can either become a
crotchety grumpy old tattooist


120
0:4:26,23 --> 0:4:29,32
or you can sort of go with the
flow a bit, and pick up on


121
0:4:29,32 --> 0:4:33,48
some of these things and draw
from what's being offered from


122
0:4:33,48 --> 0:4:35,62
talented young people
coming in there.


123
0:4:35,62 --> 0:4:39,14
When you get to a certain age
in tattooing, you've had a


124
0:4:39,14 --> 0:4:40,22
good run at it.


125
0:4:40,22 --> 0:4:41,6
You've had a good time.


126
0:4:41,6 --> 0:4:44,71
I think that you should promote
other people, people


127
0:4:44,71 --> 0:4:46,83
that are deserving of that.


128
0:4:46,83 --> 0:4:48,46
People that actually
inspire you.


129
0:4:48,46 --> 0:4:51,77
It doesn't have to be someone
who's been tattooing 50 years.


130
0:4:51,77 --> 0:4:53,9
They could tattooing 50 days.


131
0:4:53,9 --> 0:4:56,42
If they know what they're doing
and she's one of those


132
0:4:56,42 --> 0:4:58,59
people, you know, and
Stewart as well.


133
0:4:58,59 --> 0:4:59,48
So I just--


134
0:4:59,48 --> 0:4:59,81
I don't know.


135
0:4:59,81 --> 0:5:2,77
It's kind of like they're your
little adopted tattoo children


136
0:5:2,77 --> 0:5:5,8
that you want to see out there
doing it and you want them to


137
0:5:5,8 --> 0:5:8,16
succeed and do well.


138
0:5:8,16 --> 0:5:8,438
VALERIE VARGAS: Oh,
they're coming in.


139
0:5:8,438 --> 0:5:9,5
STEWART ROBSON: You done?


140
0:5:9,5 --> 0:5:9,8
LAL HARDY: Nope.


141
0:5:9,8 --> 0:5:10,9
We're talking about you.


142
0:5:10,9 --> 0:5:11,92
Do you mind if we come in?


143
0:5:11,92 --> 0:5:13,17
STEWART ROBSON: No.


144
0:5:13,17 --> 0:5:15,53



145
0:5:15,53 --> 0:5:15,94
Wielding your sword.


146
0:5:15,94 --> 0:5:17,676
VALERIE VARGAS: Get
your sword out.


147
0:5:17,676 --> 0:5:19,64
LAL HARDY: I don't very
much like her work.


148
0:5:19,64 --> 0:5:20,89
Rubbish.


149
0:5:20,89 --> 0:5:23,7



150
0:5:23,7 --> 0:5:25,59
SPEAKER 4: He said you guys
were his tattoo children.


151
0:5:25,59 --> 0:5:26,96
VALERIE VARGAS: Aw.


152
0:5:26,96 --> 0:5:28,21
STEWART ROBSON: Sweet.


153
0:5:28,21 --> 0:7:28,21
