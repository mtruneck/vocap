0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:5,94



2
0:0:5,94 --> 0:0:7,784
DAVE: Hello, I'm Dave
from Chromeo.


3
0:0:7,784 --> 0:0:8,444
PETE: And I'm Pete.


4
0:0:8,444 --> 0:0:13,23
DAVE: And this is one of our
craziest nights on the road.


5
0:0:13,23 --> 0:0:16,75
One of the first tours we've
ever done when we were a


6
0:0:16,75 --> 0:0:20,74
completely unknown band just
traveling in Pete's Rav 4


7
0:0:20,74 --> 0:0:25,26
across the continent, we had a
gig in Santa Rosa, which is


8
0:0:25,26 --> 0:0:27,5
like in the wine valley.


9
0:0:27,5 --> 0:0:28,88
And we heard that we were
going to open for


10
0:0:28,88 --> 0:0:30,5
Chippendales, male strippers.


11
0:0:30,5 --> 0:0:33,21
We pull up to this place, and
it's a saloon, and it's got


12
0:0:33,21 --> 0:0:34,68
the flapping saloon doors.


13
0:0:34,68 --> 0:0:37,52
And I just remember there being
wall-to-wall carpeting


14
0:0:37,52 --> 0:0:38,16
on the stage.


15
0:0:38,16 --> 0:0:40,63
PETE: "Beer" neon signs
and arcade machines.


16
0:0:40,63 --> 0:0:42,85
DAVE: Yeah, it was like straight
out of Twin Peaks.


17
0:0:42,85 --> 0:0:44,66
I remember they served
us spaghetti, and


18
0:0:44,66 --> 0:0:46,23
there was no one there.


19
0:0:46,23 --> 0:0:49,62
There was like a completely
empty room and the promoter


20
0:0:49,62 --> 0:0:52,72
and his friend in one
corner and one lone


21
0:0:52,72 --> 0:0:54,13
cougar by the bar.


22
0:0:54,13 --> 0:0:59,65
And she had mom jeans and a
frayed leather jacket with


23
0:0:59,65 --> 0:1:1,12
fringes and stuff.


24
0:1:1,12 --> 0:1:2,97
And then there was
the obligatory


25
0:1:2,97 --> 0:1:4,83
heavy metal sound guy.


26
0:1:4,83 --> 0:1:7,755
So Pete and I were playing for
these four people in a huge


27
0:1:7,755 --> 0:1:10,8
room, two drunken cougars
in front of us.


28
0:1:10,8 --> 0:1:13,5
And it was really, really
awkward, and we felt super


29
0:1:13,5 --> 0:1:13,59
uncomfortable.


30
0:1:13,59 --> 0:1:14,96
And then Pete and I didn't
know what to


31
0:1:14,96 --> 0:1:16,33
say between the songs.


32
0:1:16,33 --> 0:1:19,36
And I went for it, and I
go anyways guys like--


33
0:1:19,36 --> 0:1:20,135
PETE: We're sorry.


34
0:1:20,135 --> 0:1:22,28
DAVE: We're sorry we're
not the Chippendales.


35
0:1:22,28 --> 0:1:24,93
And then the sound guy yells
back "the Chippendales are


36
0:1:24,93 --> 0:1:29,5
dead," followed by feedback.


37
0:1:29,5 --> 0:1:30,97
There's so much tension
in the air.


38
0:1:30,97 --> 0:1:32,535
PETE: They had a car accident.


39
0:1:32,535 --> 0:1:35,46
DAVE: I think a van full of
Chippendales died or at least


40
0:1:35,46 --> 0:1:36,8
got really badly injured.


41
0:1:36,8 --> 0:1:39,58



42
0:1:39,58 --> 0:1:42,11
It was pretty dark, and
we felt awful, and we


43
0:1:42,11 --> 0:1:45,36
were like OK, um.


44
0:1:45,36 --> 0:1:48,25
PETE: We just finished playing,
and we drove off into


45
0:1:48,25 --> 0:1:49,5
the night, petrified.


46
0:1:49,5 --> 0:1:52,88



47
0:1:52,88 --> 0:1:54,18
DAVE: Well, that's one
of our crazy stories.


48
0:1:54,18 --> 0:3:54,18
