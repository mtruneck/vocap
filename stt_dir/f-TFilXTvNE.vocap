###2 JEFF OGIBA: I like the frog on the mushroom.
###4 DAN SANTORO: Yeah.
###4 I love that one too, man.
###6 I would really like to do that, to be honest with you.
###8 JEFF OGIBA: Who tagged all these?
###9 How big would you make that?
###11 DAN SANTORO: I'd do probably like--
###11 JEFF OGIBA: Just a little one?
###11 DAN SANTORO: Yeah.
###12 Like that more, you know?
###13 JEFF OGIBA: Like here?
###13 DAN SANTORO: Yeah.
###14 I think that's a good spot for it, actually.
###15 JEFF OGIBA: I don't know.
###16 So I don't know.
###17 DAN SANTORO: Oh, I love that frog.
###19 JEFF OGIBA: Well--
###19 DAN SANTORO: What do you want?
###20 Fucking like American flag rip-out?
###22 Jesus Christ.
###23 Everything I do is silly.
###25 JEFF OGIBA: What does it say, though?
###26 DAN SANTORO: It says that you like fucking Bluegrass.
###29 You don't mind amphibians.
###30 And you definitely get high.
###32 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###41 DAN SANTORO: I think this is an interesting design, simply
###45 because it's not like some kind of famous thing.
###50 It's not like some kind of iconic graphic.
###53 It's not like a Gibson girl or something like that.
###55 But you know it was pulled off of something, which I think is
###57 really interesting.
###59 It might have been pulled off of a candy
###60 wrapper or a cereal box.
###63 I think that's really cool.
###67 In the beginning, we didn't know how to make
###69 a good tattoo design.
###72 Neither of us did.
###73 Right, Jeff?
###74 Jeff is a long-time friend of mine.
###77 We went to high school together.
###79 I learned by doing a bunch of really shitty tattoos on him.
###82 Like in the very beginning, he wanted to just get line
###85 drawings and hardcore band things.
###87 But now, yeah, he just wants to get really funny, goofies.
###92 It's goofy, but at the same, sort of like mystical stuff.
###94 That's what he's into.
###95 I just wanted to do a tiger on his forearm.
###97 And he convinced me to do a tiger on a flying carpet
###100 jumping through atom symbols and like the galaxy and all
###104 this stuff like that.
###105 And normally, that would be a terrible idea.
###107 But it works on him.
###108 And I think I did a pretty good job on that one.
###111 He's just one of those people that, no matter what I do or
###116 do to him, it's all good.
###118 We're friends, you know?
###121 My wife and him were just having a conversation about,
###123 potentially, in the future, opening up a record store.
###126 And then, within six months, we had the grand opening.
###130 So it was just a really cool thing, because it's like a
###134 pipe dream that every kid has with their best friend when
###136 you're in high school.
###137 When we're older, we're going to have a
###139 record store one day.
###140 And half the people don't even talk to their friends from
###143 that time period any more.
###144 And here we are, grown ass men.
###146 And we have a record store.
###149 Sommer is usually the face of this place, up
###152 front making coffee.
###153 Jeff is the record guy.
###155 And I do the antique stuff, when I can.
###157 JEFF OGIBA: We all do a little bit of everything.
###159 I end up in piles of records mostly, dealing with weirdos,
###164 taking phone calls, going out to visit people who--
###168 DAN SANTORO: Try and rob you.
###169 SOMMER SANTORO: [LAUGHS]
###170 -What are some indicators that it's going to be a good buy?
###173 JEFF OGIBA: These are my uncle's.
###175 And he just overdosed on heroin.
###177 [LAUGHTER]
###178 DAN SANTORO: Yeah.
###178 That's usually a good sign, right?
###180 Johnny Thunders got you into heroin.
###182 You know?
###184 Sinatra did not, you know?
###186 JEFF OGIBA: Soon as you hear a little bit of the history, you
###188 know right away that there's a chance.
###190 DAN SANTORO: I had a guy come in here with a bunch of
###192 antique medical charts.
###193 He was a teacher.
###194 And they were in the facility closet of the science lab.
###199 And he had taken them 20 years ago or something.
###201 And they were probably sitting in there for
###202 60 years, you know?
###204 Again, someone that's going to do that is kind of weird.
###205 But I like that.
###206 Those are my people, really, you know?
###208 [LAUGHS]
###210 That's my nationality.
###211 [LAUGHS]
###212 I grew up in a relatively old house.
###215 And my father actually used to have a military store.
###217 My father was a World War II collector, specifically
###219 Italian Fascist stuff.
###221 And then he also dealt in a little German.
###224 And they had that for a few years.
###225 And then, when they closed it down, they brought everything
###227 into the house.
###228 So it was like the scariest thing ever.
###230 I used to go down to try to work on models.
###233 And there'd be two full dressed Black Brigade soldiers
###237 standing next to me.
###238 It was a weird situation to grow up in.
###240 But it was pretty normal to me.
###242 And I actually really loved the fact that that was kind of
###244 normal to my parents.
###245 So it's funny.
###246 Some people walk through the doors here and they're just
###248 hit in the face with, I don't know, the whole store.
###252 They can't wrap their head around why anybody would buy
###254 any of this.
###256 But for us, I mean, this is my life.
###257 This has been my life.
###258 All of us.
###260 
###262 It's like I travel on the weekend quite a bit, when I'm
###266 not tattooing.
###268 Flea markets, yard sales, Craigslist.
###271 I get it anywhere I can, you know?
###274 It's a pretty small window of opportunity
###277 for me to get stuff.
###278 So all week, I'm trying to line stuff up.
###281 STEVE BOLTZ: He's a bit of a picker.
###282 I mean, he likes to go to antique
###284 stores and antique fairs.
###286 
###290 And then, of course, Black Gold now has given him purpose
###293 in that hoarding.
###294 I think, before, it was just like having stuff.
###297 We all like to just have stuff we like
###298 to look at or whatever.
###299 But now he's got the store.
###301 Now he can actually justify having as
###303 much of it as he wants.
###304 BERT KRAK: A lot of stuff that Dan looks for is kind of tied
###309 into tattooing, as far as what the image is or it's got those
###313 rock of ages things.
###314 It's like classic tattoo motifs that he looks for.
###321 I guess it's stuff that tattooing has borrowed from
###324 the real world, you know?
###326 STEVE BOLTZ: Dan's object hoarding, it comes mainly from
###330 tattooing, I would imagine, even though there's other
###332 influences, because you just are exposed to so many
###334 different types of art.
###336 You think about tattooing now, well, that crawling panther
###339 has been drawn for us already.
###340 You know what I mean?
###340 But there was a time when it didn't exist.
###343 And somebody came in and wanted a panther
###345 crawling up their arm.
###346 Well, Coleman or one of these guys had to find some sort of
###350 reference for this.
###351 And a lot of early designs, they'll come from old
###353 children's books or comics or whatever.
###358 Or the Kewpie is a good example.
###360 A Kewpie was an actual doll.
###362 Then it became a tattoo icon over the years.
###364 But now, because we know that Kewpie so well, well, you go
###368 into an antique store or something and you see a little
###371 Kewpie doll sitting on the shelf, you're like, oh, there
###373 it is in 3D.
###374 DAN SANTORO: Oh yeah.
###374 Here's another thing.
###375 That thing is ready to be a tattoo too.
###377 There's a Kewpie little home butler thing.
###380 But it's a Kewpie.
###382 Who doesn't want that?
###384 My house has, more or less, looked like
###385 this for a long time.
###388 It went from "Star Wars" toys, as much as I can fill.
###393 I thought it was corny for a while.
###395 So then I did the thrasher cut out thing.
###397 As long as the walls just looked like culture
###401 vomit, I was happy.
###403 You know what I mean?
###404 And then it became like tattoo flash.
###405 And then tattoo flash kind of evolved into old circus prints
###411 and lithographs that were what a lot of the tattoo stuff was
###415 derived from, and so on, and so on, and so on.
###417 And then, the next thing you know, you've
###419 got a lot of stuff.
###420 [ORGAN MUSIC]
###427 ELI QUINTERS: It's not a big apartment.
###429 And he's filled the walls.
###431 But it's all amazing stuff, you know?
###434 It's top of the line taxidermy, old tattoo flash.
###440 It's just the way he wants it.
###442 You know what I mean?
###443 It's a good representation of the stuff that
###446 he's passionate about.
###447 [ORGAN MUSIC]
###449 DAN SANTORO: Oh!
###451 I just found this at a flea market.
###452 It's a studio portrait of a mother and two children.
###457 And the two kids are on a taxidermied ostrich.
###460 It's like anything, you know?
###461 You get into collecting one thing.
###463 And then you start to pick up the subtleties that make one
###465 thing more appealing than the other.
###467 I've been flea marketing for a long time.
###469 And if I had seen something like this, I'd probably be
###472 interested in buying it.
###473 But I wouldn't know why.
###474 Whereas now, I'm a little bit more immersed in collecting.
###480 It's pretty easy to pick up on what
###482 makes something desirable.
###483 So to me, that's very desirable.
###484 It's an ostrich.
###485 How often do you see an ostrich in a photo from the
###487 turn of the century?
###489 This is a photo I picked up that I thought was pretty
###491 interesting, just in a box of random photos.
###493 It's obviously some kind of carnival performer.
###497 But she's reading a magazine.
###498 And the back ad of the magazine is, "Tattoo your
###502 lips." Another stony tattooing the inside of a woman lips.
###505 ELI QUINTERS: Very well-studied in stuff of that
###509 era, of when American tattooing came to life.
###514 He knows a lot about that era in history anyway.
###519 And so I think he collects a lot of that stuff.
###523 So he's very well-studied in antique flash.
###526 And he knows a lot about that stuff.
###528 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###533 DAN SANTORO: I have a lithograph of that at the
###535 store right now.
###537 That's the one that I said you see a lot of the lithographs
###540 that old tattooers pulled from.
###543 That particular image, I had never seen recreated as a
###545 tattoo before.
###546 And I had actually obtained this about
###548 five, six years ago.
###549 And I was like, oh, that's the coolest thing.
###551 I didn't know who did it.
###552 It came from the same collection that a bunch of
###554 other stuff that I was told was Coleman came from.
###558 He was a tattooer from Virginia.
###562 He just was the pioneer of a lot of the
###564 style that we see today.
###566 He had a knack for drawing really pretty women.
###569 And everything he did was a step above everything else
###574 that was going on at the time.
###575 This is a famous photo of Coleman outside his shop.
###579 So I've seen this photo hundreds of times.
###581 I was like, oh, if I could only see around the corner of
###583 that, you know?
###584 And then, when this book came out, boom, the other wall.
###587 And that made my day.
###591 100%, that is that.
###596 I was told his shop burned down.
###598 Then a lot of the stuff got kicked to the curb.
###600 And the woman that I acquired a lot of this stuff from, her
###604 husband had gone and, I guess, picked up a lot of this stuff,
###608 literally, off the side of the road.
###610 And so that's why something like that exists.
###613 That was just two of the designs on the sheet that
###615 weren't scorched.
###617 There's a photo of him tattooing.
###619 It's that famous photo of him tattooing with the visor.
###623 There's all the flash on the wall.
###624 He's got one sheet off the wall.
###625 And it's propped up on his station.
###627 And these two designs are on that sheet.
###629 But it had been cut.
###630 A lot of this stuff got cut.
###633 One thing that I really don't ever want to be is
###635 self-absorbed.
###636 And when someone asks me to talk about all these things
###639 that I've surrounded myself with, it makes me feel like
###641 I'm self-absorbed.
###642
