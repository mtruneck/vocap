1
0:0:2,629 --> 0:0:7,849
We come to the Earth which well, grew, to
get here to where it is now. Here is our world,


2
0:0:7,849 --> 0:0:15,1
our Planet Earth floating in space. We will
be going backward in time. Imperfectly but


3
0:0:15,1 --> 0:0:22,589
done in a very disciplined manner. Please
notice there is no subduction, no rotation


4
0:0:22,589 --> 0:0:29,839
of tectonic plates, no twisting, no form fitting,
no altering shapes or sizes. It would be impossible,


5
0:0:29,839 --> 0:0:34,83
impossible, for these continental plates to
fit together perfectly without this being


6
0:0:34,83 --> 0:0:43,92
true, and yet the upper tectonic plates fit
together perfectly – on a much smaller planet.


7
0:0:43,92 --> 0:0:49,8
Yes, there’s been some erosion, landslides,
blah blah, but overall this activity is insignificant.


8
0:0:49,8 --> 0:0:54,72
There is a kind of conspiracy of silence among
certain scientists, they know but are not


9
0:0:54,72 --> 0:1:2,44
telling you that the upper tectonic plates
of Earth also join in the Pacific. Not partially,


10
0:1:2,44 --> 0:1:7,439
they join totally. You are asked to believe
that the continents swim or drift about willy


11
0:1:7,439 --> 0:1:14,439
nilly bumping and crashing as if they were
on a greased skillet. This is not true. The


12
0:1:14,439 --> 0:1:20,719
simple truth is apparently too upsetting to
too many apple carts. We are now going forward


13
0:1:20,719 --> 0:1:26,49
in time to show how the actual growth of the
Earth took place. Imperfect in details, but


14
0:1:26,49 --> 0:1:31,609
the overall is nailed.


15
0:1:31,609 --> 0:1:41,6
Antarctica as you see has become sub-tropical.
Africa on a smaller globe moved way down under


16
0:1:41,6 --> 0:1:48,63
the globe. In fact for hundreds of millions
of years the bottom of Africa was the South


17
0:1:48,63 --> 0:1:54,959
Pole. South America’s tail goes under and
wraps around the bottom of Africa, then incredibly


18
0:1:54,959 --> 0:2:1,819
joins coasts with Antarctica. 65 million years
ago and more these continents were joined


19
0:2:1,819 --> 0:2:7,259
and marsupials like the duck billed platypus
roamed from Australia, Antarctica and across


20
0:2:7,259 --> 0:2:11,56
southern South America and up into Africa;
the platypus.


21
0:2:11,56 --> 0:2:17,81
Dinosaurs roamed all over this world on the
upper tectonic plate because there were no


22
0:2:17,81 --> 0:2:24,86
oceans, just shallow seas. Here today Antarctica
is frozen over and Australia and its surrounding


23
0:2:24,86 --> 0:2:31,5
islands are the remaining home of marsupials.


24
0:2:31,5 --> 0:2:36,84
Do you see how broadly the Pacific is opening
compared to the Atlantic? This is exactly


25
0:2:36,84 --> 0:2:45,2
why the knee jerk Pangea theory exists. The
Pacific spread is to difficult to easily visualize


26
0:2:45,2 --> 0:2:49,46
because its so big.


27
0:2:49,46 --> 0:3:10,62
The Atlantic spread is so obvious that a child
would recognize it. But they are the same.


28
0:3:10,62 --> 0:3:17,37
Check this map out. The Navy and others took
core samples to find the ages of the sea bottom.


29
0:3:17,37 --> 0:3:21,47
Low and behold no part of the undersea was
found to be much more than 70 million years


30
0:3:21,47 --> 0:3:28,23
old. Does that shock you? It should. It shocked
the scientists. Where did they get ancient


31
0:3:28,23 --> 0:3:34,9
fish fossils from? From the land, like in
Mississippi, and Utah, and France, and China.


32
0:3:34,9 --> 0:3:42,75
Most of the undersea wasn’t there 70 or
80 million years ago. The measurements of


33
0:3:42,75 --> 0:3:47,18
the core samples give the age of the sea floor.


34
0:3:47,18 --> 0:3:54,64
Newest, 10 million or so, is red. As we go
back in time we go back in our rainbow, orange,


35
0:3:54,64 --> 0:4:2,4
yellow, green blue. Okay? So we bury the new
sea floor back to the fault lines dictated


36
0:4:2,4 --> 0:4:10,67
by color or age. Ten million years back, these
are the ages of the sea floor as measured


37
0:4:10,67 --> 0:4:15,46
science and they’re generally true. Earth
grew.


38
0:4:15,46 --> 0:4:17,1
Twenty million…


39
0:4:17,1 --> 0:4:22,75
I’m not making this information up. This
map comes from the scientific community.


40
0:4:22,75 --> 0:4:24,28
30 million…


41
0:4:24,28 --> 0:4:28,91
You can find this same map in many places
on the internet. It’s common knowledge.


42
0:4:28,91 --> 0:4:30,96
40…


43
0:4:30,96 --> 0:4:36,5
The ocean bottom is from 1 year to 180 million
years old.


44
0:4:36,5 --> 0:4:36,83
50…


45
0:4:36,83 --> 0:4:41,63
70% of it is no older than 60 million years
old.


46
0:4:41,63 --> 0:4:44,7
60…


47
0:4:44,7 --> 0:4:50,4
The upper plates, the continents, are as old
as 2 billion years old and more.


48
0:4:50,4 --> 0:4:52,23
70…


49
0:4:52,23 --> 0:4:59,52
10 to 20 times as old as the undersea plates.
The undersea plate is new and spreading at


50
0:4:59,52 --> 0:5:5,49
the rifts. Why does the scientific community
desperately cling to and promote the idea


51
0:5:5,49 --> 0:5:10,76
that the ocean bottom is sliding under the
continents and into a magma which is twice


52
0:5:10,76 --> 0:5:19,71
as dense as solid granite, a totally unsupportable
and scientifically unsound idea? They have


53
0:5:19,71 --> 0:5:26,21
to. Or else they would have to observe and
admit that the Earth is growing. And that,


54
0:5:26,21 --> 0:5:33,52
viewers is a very big deal. That would change
everything in science, from the smallest particle


55
0:5:33,52 --> 0:5:39,58
to the whole universe. 100 years of scientific
theory out the window. That’s a lot to give


56
0:5:39,58 --> 0:5:39,76
up.


57
0:5:39,76 --> 0:5:45,48
It’s important to remember that science
and the universe should and must be easier


58
0:5:45,48 --> 0:5:49,36
to understand as we go back in the universe’s
evolution.


59
0:5:49,36 --> 0:5:56,77
This is an undersea map. As a kind of test
for ourselves, we deemed it important to show


60
0:5:56,77 --> 0:6:4,5
that not only the upper plate had to fit properly
together, but the undersea had to spread in


61
0:6:4,5 --> 0:6:11,8
a logical and uniform pattern that we could
see and understand as rational humans. Do


62
0:6:11,8 --> 0:6:17,49
you see those lines in the undersea, which,
beyond information show direction. The direction


63
0:6:17,49 --> 0:6:23,15
of movement apart and away from the rifts.
In fact it’s like a movement diagram isn’t


64
0:6:23,15 --> 0:6:26,2
it? Ah, we’re moving now.


65
0:6:26,2 --> 0:6:32,15
Let me point out that the newer undersea near
the rifts is smoother and more regular than


66
0:6:32,15 --> 0:6:38,43
the older land further away from the rifts.


67
0:6:38,43 --> 0:6:42,83
Here in the Atlantic the rift goes right at
the middle. Half the Earth’s growth has


68
0:6:42,83 --> 0:6:47,43
happened since the extinction of dinosaurs.
This means that the Earth is accelerating


69
0:6:47,43 --> 0:6:47,77
in its growth.


70
0:6:47,77 --> 0:6:53,82
In the last 65 million years Earth nearly
doubled in size. The last redoubling took


71
0:6:53,82 --> 0:6:57,9
600 million years, at least.


72
0:6:57,9 --> 0:7:4,93
We’re continuing all the undersea directions
like following a blueprint. The Earth guides


73
0:7:4,93 --> 0:7:7,83
us.


74
0:7:7,83 --> 0:7:24,49
And now the land masses will come together.
Perfectly.


75
0:7:24,49 --> 0:7:32,51
As we now go forward in time from 185 million
years ago, please notice there is no subduction.


76
0:7:32,51 --> 0:7:38,9
No raising and lowering of land masses, there
can’t be. It’s hell in the form of magma


77
0:7:38,9 --> 0:7:46,54
down there. Local raising and lowering yes,
but not on a massive basis. It can’t happen.


78
0:7:46,54 --> 0:7:53,4
There’s no turning or rotating of land masses.
The land masses sit in their individual plates


79
0:7:53,4 --> 0:7:57,889
and don’t move. The rifts open and that’s
all.


80
0:7:57,889 --> 0:8:4,419
For examination I’m going to run a few vignettes
of areas of Earth that you have the right


81
0:8:4,419 --> 0:8:6,34
to be curious about.


82
0:8:6,34 --> 0:8:17,18
The North Pole. Man, I love this map so much.
There was a piece in the National Geo. It


83
0:8:17,18 --> 0:8:23,61
shows that the trees in Asia and North America
were exactly the same trees. Well, this is


84
0:8:23,61 --> 0:8:26,87
why; the land was together when the trees
evolved.


85
0:8:26,87 --> 0:8:38,539
The 


86
0:8:38,539 --> 0:8:52,57
South Pole…


87
0:8:52,57 --> 0:8:59,2
The oceans have absolutely nothing to do with
tectonic spreading, except that they cooled


88
0:8:59,2 --> 0:9:6,21
the thickening mantel. Tectonic spreading,
even according to the most conservative scientist


89
0:9:6,21 --> 0:9:14,76
has created two thirds of the Earth’s surface
in the last 200 million years. And therefore,


90
0:9:14,76 --> 0:9:25,88
the same, the same must be true on all planets,
including Mars. Must. And we can see the younger


91
0:9:25,88 --> 0:9:30,37
spreads on Mars just as on Earth.


92
0:9:30,37 --> 0:9:39,11
But there is, just as clearly, no subduction
on Mars. It can’t be both ways. You either


93
0:9:39,11 --> 0:9:47,93
have spreading and subduction or you have
only spreading, and you must have spreading.


94
0:9:47,93 --> 0:9:53,82
Or, you can continue to ignore the facts and
say as the ancients said, that the Earth is


95
0:9:53,82 --> 0:10:0,31
unique and singular in the universe and that
we are the center, and the universe rotates


96
0:10:0,31 --> 0:12:0,31
around the Earth.
