2
0:0:4,98 --> 0:0:8,2
FEMALE SPEAKER: Welcome to
Fashion Week International, a


3
0:0:8,2 --> 0:0:10,91
new show that reports on the
most fabulous fashion weeks in


4
0:0:10,91 --> 0:0:14,7
the world, and the culture
and politics behind them.


5
0:0:14,7 --> 0:0:18,18
We've saved the best until last,
a fashion week in the


6
0:0:18,18 --> 0:0:19,635
capital city of chaos.


7
0:0:19,635 --> 0:0:30,4



8
0:0:30,4 --> 0:0:32,34
This is Lagos, Nigeria.


9
0:0:32,34 --> 0:0:37,27
It's home to 8 or 15 or 18
million people, depending


10
0:0:37,27 --> 0:0:39,53
which census figure
you believe.


11
0:0:39,53 --> 0:0:43,8
And like anywhere with a large
population density, it's not


12
0:0:43,8 --> 0:0:45,86
without its troubles.


13
0:0:45,86 --> 0:0:50,22
Civil, state-sponsored
homophobia, religious tension,


14
0:0:50,22 --> 0:0:53,33
and widespread corruption are
among the many factors that


15
0:0:53,33 --> 0:0:56,0
have led to calls for the
resignation of longstanding


16
0:0:56,0 --> 0:0:57,386
president, Goodluck Jonathan.


17
0:0:57,386 --> 0:1:3,163



18
0:1:3,163 --> 0:1:4,729
MALE SPEAKER: Actually,
such elements of


19
0:1:4,729 --> 0:1:6,27
society should be killed.


20
0:1:6,27 --> 0:1:8,29
FEMALE SPEAKER: With that in
mind, we prepared ourselves


21
0:1:8,29 --> 0:1:12,24
for Nigeria Fashion Week with
not a little trepidation.


22
0:1:12,24 --> 0:1:15,5
But like all the fabulous placed
we've visited so far


23
0:1:15,5 --> 0:1:18,14
this series, we were sure we'd
find something beautiful


24
0:1:18,14 --> 0:1:19,465
behind the depressing
headlines.


25
0:1:19,465 --> 0:1:27,4



26
0:1:27,4 --> 0:1:30,7
There are many different fashion
weeks held throughout


27
0:1:30,7 --> 0:1:30,98
the year in Lagos.


28
0:1:30,98 --> 0:1:34,29
But we were here for what we
were assured was the official


29
0:1:34,29 --> 0:1:35,9
Nigeria Fashion Week.


30
0:1:35,9 --> 0:1:40,76



31
0:1:40,76 --> 0:1:42,32
First stop was the headquarters
of the


32
0:1:42,32 --> 0:1:43,7
organizers, Legendary Gold.


33
0:1:43,7 --> 0:1:48,952



34
0:1:48,952 --> 0:1:52,0
We've arrived at the Legendary
Gold offices.


35
0:1:52,0 --> 0:1:53,92
And this is the hub of
the fashion week.


36
0:1:53,92 --> 0:1:55,99
We're going to inside
and get legendary


37
0:1:55,99 --> 0:1:58,79
services valuable as gold.


38
0:1:58,79 --> 0:2:1,84
The fantastically named
Lexy Mojo-Eyes


39
0:2:1,84 --> 0:2:3,65
is the man in charge.


40
0:2:3,65 --> 0:2:6,52
He also looks like Don
King, if Don King


41
0:2:6,52 --> 0:2:7,77
had gone into fashion.


42
0:2:7,77 --> 0:2:17,14



43
0:2:17,14 --> 0:2:18,859
FEMALE SPEAKER: What does
fashion mean to you?


44
0:2:18,859 --> 0:2:32,9



45
0:2:32,9 --> 0:2:33,15
FEMALE SPEAKER: The models
are assembled


46
0:2:33,15 --> 0:2:34,42
for a fitting session.


47
0:2:34,42 --> 0:2:37,32
And things were getting
very naked.


48
0:2:37,32 --> 0:2:41,6
And so I went in search
of the boys.


49
0:2:41,6 --> 0:2:43,53
MALE SPEAKER: (SINGING) Before
you choose to use, before you


50
0:2:43,53 --> 0:2:49,39
choose to use, use your device
so you don't have rain drops


51
0:2:49,39 --> 0:2:52,35
falling from your eyes.


52
0:2:52,35 --> 0:2:53,6
[INAUDIBLE].


53
0:2:53,6 --> 0:2:55,46



54
0:2:55,46 --> 0:2:59,5
Gonna have to pay the price,
pay the price.


55
0:2:59,5 --> 0:3:6,58



56
0:3:6,58 --> 0:3:7,83
FEMALE SPEAKER: In what
way are you quirky?


57
0:3:7,83 --> 0:3:16,23



58
0:3:16,23 --> 0:3:17,619
[LAUGHTER]


59
0:3:17,619 --> 0:3:23,82



60
0:3:23,82 --> 0:3:25,7
[LAUGHTER]


61
0:3:25,7 --> 0:3:29,108



62
0:3:29,108 --> 0:3:31,91
FEMALE SPEAKER: That's girly?


63
0:3:31,91 --> 0:3:33,311
FEMALE SPEAKER: I thought
this was more serious.


64
0:3:33,311 --> 0:3:42,27



65
0:3:42,27 --> 0:3:44,51
MALE SPEAKER: Becuase
I love Africa.


66
0:3:44,51 --> 0:3:46,465
Africa is the best
place to be.


67
0:3:46,465 --> 0:3:49,62
And when you come closer, you
find out that we are friendly


68
0:3:49,62 --> 0:3:50,99
people, good people.


69
0:3:50,99 --> 0:3:54,364
For example, in Nigeria right
now, are we not friendly?


70
0:3:54,364 --> 0:3:56,292
FEMALE SPEAKERS (IN UNISON):
Welcome to Nigeria Fashion


71
0:3:56,292 --> 0:3:58,702
Week, [INAUDIBLE].


72
0:3:58,702 --> 0:4:0,16
[CHEERING]


73
0:4:0,16 --> 0:4:2,26
FEMALE SPEAKER: The fashion
itself was being held at a


74
0:4:2,26 --> 0:4:5,11
slightly rundown looking
government building where


75
0:4:5,11 --> 0:4:9,49
Prince Charles himself had
laid the first stone.


76
0:4:9,49 --> 0:4:12,82
It's quarter past 12:00.


77
0:4:12,82 --> 0:4:14,395
Which is a bit worrying, because
the show is supposed


78
0:4:14,395 --> 0:4:15,31
to start at 12:00.


79
0:4:15,31 --> 0:4:18,5
And so far, there's no show.


80
0:4:18,5 --> 0:4:20,559
There's about six models
backstage who still haven't


81
0:4:20,559 --> 0:4:22,303
had their hair and
makeup done.


82
0:4:22,303 --> 0:4:24,83
And there's no audience.


83
0:4:24,83 --> 0:4:28,11
We went to check out the
backstage progress.


84
0:4:28,11 --> 0:4:29,63
Tempers were already rising.


85
0:4:29,63 --> 0:4:35,86



86
0:4:35,86 --> 0:4:37,545
FRED EBOKA: I told you,
you sit here.


87
0:4:37,545 --> 0:4:38,24
Isn't it?


88
0:4:38,24 --> 0:4:39,38
You are going back this way.


89
0:4:39,38 --> 0:4:39,64
FEMALE SPEAKER: This way.


90
0:4:39,64 --> 0:4:40,702
FRED EBOKA: Yes, exactly.


91
0:4:40,702 --> 0:4:42,95
So you go now.


92
0:4:42,95 --> 0:4:43,55
And you follow.


93
0:4:43,55 --> 0:4:44,482
Come back.


94
0:4:44,482 --> 0:4:44,98
[INAUDIBLE]


95
0:4:44,98 --> 0:4:45,63
just stand here.


96
0:4:45,63 --> 0:4:46,576
That's what I tell you.


97
0:4:46,576 --> 0:4:48,44
I do not want drama.


98
0:4:48,44 --> 0:4:52,472
I don't want drama, because
I'm full of drama.


99
0:4:52,472 --> 0:4:54,344
[LAUGHTER]


100
0:4:54,344 --> 0:4:56,29
FRED EBOKA: My standards
mustn't go down


101
0:4:56,29 --> 0:4:57,9
because I'm in Nigeria.


102
0:4:57,9 --> 0:4:59,82
Standards should be the same
to you all over the world.


103
0:4:59,82 --> 0:5:1,21
But for some reason--


104
0:5:1,21 --> 0:5:2,38
FEMALE SPEAKER: It's
not very good.


105
0:5:2,38 --> 0:5:5,365
FRED EBOKA: --I have to adapt
myself to a certain degree.


106
0:5:5,365 --> 0:5:6,12
People can wait.


107
0:5:6,12 --> 0:5:7,73
And they have such patience.


108
0:5:7,73 --> 0:5:9,44
I don't have that kind
of patience.


109
0:5:9,44 --> 0:5:10,46
Don't deny me attention.


110
0:5:10,46 --> 0:5:13,21
Otherwise I go very crazy and
a drama, drama queen.


111
0:5:13,21 --> 0:5:18,69



112
0:5:18,69 --> 0:5:20,99
FEMALE SPEAKER: However, Lexy
didn't quite see the problem.


113
0:5:20,99 --> 0:5:33,216



114
0:5:33,216 --> 0:5:36,8
FEMALE SPEAKER: If you want
something to start at 12:00,


115
0:5:36,8 --> 0:5:39,242
you tell people to get
there at 8:00 AM.


116
0:5:39,242 --> 0:5:40,106
[LAUGHTER]


117
0:5:40,106 --> 0:5:42,62
FEMALE SPEAKER: And sure enough,
two hours after the


118
0:5:42,62 --> 0:5:45,74
first show was scheduled to
begin, the glamorous crowds


119
0:5:45,74 --> 0:5:49,533
started to roll in, each one
making sure to take a turn on


120
0:5:49,533 --> 0:5:50,262
the red carpet.


121
0:5:50,262 --> 0:5:52,692
MALE SPEAKER: Whoa!


122
0:5:52,692 --> 0:5:54,636
FEMALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].


123
0:5:54,636 --> 0:5:55,608
FEMALE SPEAKER: Whoa!


124
0:5:55,608 --> 0:5:57,66
The thing just collapsed on me.


125
0:5:57,66 --> 0:5:58,524
Oh my God.


126
0:5:58,524 --> 0:5:59,792
It's going to fall off.


127
0:5:59,792 --> 0:6:2,625
So if I move, it's all over.


128
0:6:2,625 --> 0:6:6,321
But then they kill this
beautiful lady.


129
0:6:6,321 --> 0:6:7,692
Go, let's go.


130
0:6:7,692 --> 0:6:17,594



131
0:6:17,594 --> 0:6:21,53
FEMALE SPEAKER: Anyone
got matches?


132
0:6:21,53 --> 0:6:23,93
FEMALE SPEAKER: This year's
theme was going green.


133
0:6:23,93 --> 0:6:26,0
This is understandable
given Lagos's


134
0:6:26,0 --> 0:6:27,82
critical pollution issues.


135
0:6:27,82 --> 0:6:30,58
Energy efficient light bulb hats
and dresses made out of


136
0:6:30,58 --> 0:6:33,33
leaves ere made to look
surprising elegant by the


137
0:6:33,33 --> 0:6:34,265
gorgeous girls.


138
0:6:34,265 --> 0:6:37,25
And the boy's helped out by
donning what looked to be


139
0:6:37,25 --> 0:6:39,98
lederhosen made of hay.


140
0:6:39,98 --> 0:6:43,53
One designer who stood out
was self-taught Dabo, who


141
0:6:43,53 --> 0:6:46,18
specialized in pairing
recycled plastic and


142
0:6:46,18 --> 0:6:48,52
traditional fabrics
with sexy results.


143
0:6:48,52 --> 0:6:57,136



144
0:6:57,136 --> 0:6:58,92
FEMALE SPEAKER: I love this.


145
0:6:58,92 --> 0:6:59,38
Quite sexual.


146
0:6:59,38 --> 0:7:1,67
Do people say to you,
oh my God, Dabo?


147
0:7:1,67 --> 0:7:2,782
DABO: Yeah, Dabo [INAUDIBLE].


148
0:7:2,782 --> 0:7:4,2
[LAUGHTER]


149
0:7:4,2 --> 0:7:5,45
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'm trying it.


150
0:7:5,45 --> 0:7:8,45



151
0:7:8,45 --> 0:7:9,98
FEMALE SPEAKER: Look, they're
all going to laugh at us.


152
0:7:9,98 --> 0:7:20,47



153
0:7:20,47 --> 0:7:21,72
FEMALE SPEAKER: Whilst the
girls maintained a


154
0:7:21,72 --> 0:7:24,64
professional front, the boys
just seemed to be having a


155
0:7:24,64 --> 0:7:27,695
great time admiring their own
beauty and other attributes.


156
0:7:27,695 --> 0:7:36,24



157
0:7:36,24 --> 0:7:39,18
FEMALE SPEAKER: So the more
hard you work, the bigger


158
0:7:39,18 --> 0:7:40,43
penis you have?


159
0:7:40,43 --> 0:7:47,51



160
0:7:47,51 --> 0:7:49,538
FEMALE SPEAKER: Guys are
more vain than girls.


161
0:7:49,538 --> 0:7:50,788
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.


162
0:7:50,788 --> 0:7:59,2



163
0:7:59,2 --> 0:8:0,45
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'll
give it to you.


164
0:8:0,45 --> 0:8:9,87



165
0:8:9,87 --> 0:8:12,39
FEMALE SPEAKER: If men wore
makeup in the street, what


166
0:8:12,39 --> 0:8:13,64
would happen to them?


167
0:8:13,64 --> 0:8:20,9



168
0:8:20,9 --> 0:8:23,21
FEMALE SPEAKER: It wasn't just
social discrimination the gay


169
0:8:23,21 --> 0:8:25,11
community had to worry about.


170
0:8:25,11 --> 0:8:27,22
Homophobic sentiment
had recently been


171
0:8:27,22 --> 0:8:28,47
enshrined in law.


172
0:8:28,47 --> 0:8:44,53



173
0:8:44,53 --> 0:8:47,5
FEMALE SPEAKER: We'd met Datari,
a fellow Englishman


174
0:8:47,5 --> 0:8:51,49
backstage, former stylist to UK
boy bands such as Boyzone.


175
0:8:51,49 --> 0:8:54,78
He'd come to Lagos to pursue
business opportunities.


176
0:8:54,78 --> 0:8:57,14
However, the recent developments
meant he was


177
0:8:57,14 --> 0:8:59,42
considering going
back to the UK.


178
0:8:59,42 --> 0:9:1,67
DATARI: If you're really camp,
then trust me, you can't


179
0:9:1,67 --> 0:9:2,484
survive in Nigeria.


180
0:9:2,484 --> 0:9:4,73
Why do you think I wear shirts
and hats all the time?


181
0:9:4,73 --> 0:9:7,13
I'm the butch, you
know what I me?


182
0:9:7,13 --> 0:9:8,38
I wish I could train my voice.


183
0:9:8,38 --> 0:9:9,66
Because that's, like,
a giveaway,


184
0:9:9,66 --> 0:9:11,552
you know what I mean?


185
0:9:11,552 --> 0:9:15,4
If you're gay, you either get
killed, or you go to prison,


186
0:9:15,4 --> 0:9:17,32
you get disowned
by your family.


187
0:9:17,32 --> 0:9:23,12
That's why most Nigerian celebs,
or Nigerian guys go


188
0:9:23,12 --> 0:9:26,35
abroad to end up staying there
and claiming asylum.


189
0:9:26,35 --> 0:9:27,995
Someone calls the police.


190
0:9:27,995 --> 0:9:32,88
And all of you get humiliated,
put you on TV.


191
0:9:32,88 --> 0:9:35,1
No only are you out
to the government.


192
0:9:35,1 --> 0:9:36,9
You're out to your family,
to your friends.


193
0:9:36,9 --> 0:9:39,1
I mean, you've lived a
lie all your life.


194
0:9:39,1 --> 0:9:41,214
And then all of a sudden,
you're on TV for what?


195
0:9:41,214 --> 0:9:42,63
For being gay.


196
0:9:42,63 --> 0:9:45,577
Eventually, if you come out of
prison, you can't even go back


197
0:9:45,577 --> 0:9:47,41
to your home town
anymore because


198
0:9:47,41 --> 0:9:48,81
everyone knows about it.


199
0:9:48,81 --> 0:9:49,675
[INAUDIBLE]


200
0:9:49,675 --> 0:9:52,5
stoning you, calling
you names.


201
0:9:52,5 --> 0:9:54,278
Trust me, you'll get caught.


202
0:9:54,278 --> 0:10:4,924



203
0:10:4,924 --> 0:10:7,47
FEMALE SPEAKER: After meeting
Datari and having him tell us


204
0:10:7,47 --> 0:10:10,75
how the majority of gay people
in Niger have to conceal their


205
0:10:10,75 --> 0:10:14,56
sexuality for fear of going to
prison, we started to wonder


206
0:10:14,56 --> 0:10:16,81
how many other people at this
fashion event were hiding


207
0:10:16,81 --> 0:10:20,154
their true identity.


208
0:10:20,154 --> 0:10:22,634
BLESSED: Your face,
you make it ugly.


209
0:10:22,634 --> 0:10:25,114
Yeah, you don't do it
with your fine face.


210
0:10:25,114 --> 0:10:28,9



211
0:10:28,9 --> 0:10:30,322
FEMALE SPEAKER: This is our
friend Blessed, the


212
0:10:30,322 --> 0:10:31,572
hairdresser.


213
0:10:31,572 --> 0:10:35,53



214
0:10:35,53 --> 0:10:37,89
FEMALE SPEAKER: From the moment
we arrived, wherever we


215
0:10:37,89 --> 0:10:39,98
went, Blessed went too.


216
0:10:39,98 --> 0:10:44,49
To the extent that we could
barely talk to anyone else.


217
0:10:44,49 --> 0:10:47,33
Off camera, he told us some
surprising things about the


218
0:10:47,33 --> 0:10:48,62
gay community.


219
0:10:48,62 --> 0:10:51,16
He invited us to come visit his
neighborhood so that he


220
0:10:51,16 --> 0:10:52,73
could talk a bit more freely.


221
0:10:52,73 --> 0:11:3,36



222
0:11:3,36 --> 0:11:6,8
First, we met his mother
and his nephew.


223
0:11:6,8 --> 0:11:10,85



224
0:11:10,85 --> 0:11:12,548
And then he took us to some
of his friends' houses.


225
0:11:12,548 --> 0:11:14,46
BLESSED: This is [INAUDIBLE]


226
0:11:14,46 --> 0:11:15,894

227
0:11:15,894 --> 0:11:17,144
Yes.


228
0:11:17,144 --> 0:11:19,25



229
0:11:19,25 --> 0:11:21,31
FEMALE SPEAKER: After that, he
took us to the biggest street


230
0:11:21,31 --> 0:11:22,28
market in Lagos.


231
0:11:22,28 --> 0:11:23,45
BLESSED: We are in [INAUDIBLE]


232
0:11:23,45 --> 0:11:25,17
Market.


233
0:11:25,17 --> 0:11:27,57
FEMALE SPEAKER: This is one of
the most hectic, overcrowded


234
0:11:27,57 --> 0:11:30,65
markets in the world, with
thousands of people passing


235
0:11:30,65 --> 0:11:32,124
through it at all times.


236
0:11:32,124 --> 0:11:36,6



237
0:11:36,6 --> 0:11:38,67
And then, Blessed too us
somewhere he could confess a


238
0:11:38,67 --> 0:11:40,19
few things about his
relationship


239
0:11:40,19 --> 0:11:42,422
with the fashion world.


240
0:11:42,422 --> 0:11:44,52
We're at a salon where
Blessed used to work.


241
0:11:44,52 --> 0:11:46,96
And they're going
to do my nails,


242
0:11:46,96 --> 0:11:48,44
because they need doing.


243
0:11:48,44 --> 0:11:49,69
Why did you become
a hairdresser?


244
0:11:49,69 --> 0:12:6,88



245
0:12:6,88 --> 0:12:8,455
FEMALE SPEAKER: But you are
not gay, obviously.


246
0:12:8,455 --> 0:12:30,27



247
0:12:30,27 --> 0:12:31,3
BLESSED: Don't say it.


248
0:12:31,3 --> 0:12:32,28
FEMALE SPEAKER: I
won't say it.


249
0:12:32,28 --> 0:12:43,26



250
0:12:43,26 --> 0:12:44,51
FEMALE SPEAKER: In the
fashion industry?


251
0:12:44,51 --> 0:12:55,55



252
0:12:55,55 --> 0:12:58,59
FEMALE SPEAKER: Lagos is a
deeply God-fearing city, with


253
0:12:58,59 --> 0:13:2,66
the church having a firm hold
over the population.


254
0:13:2,66 --> 0:13:5,15
Even some of the fashion
photographers haven't quite


255
0:13:5,15 --> 0:13:8,25
reconciled their faith with the
decadent display of flesh


256
0:13:8,25 --> 0:13:10,37
at the fashion week.


257
0:13:10,37 --> 0:13:12,26
All the models were, like,
running around naked.


258
0:13:12,26 --> 0:13:13,662
How did it feel?


259
0:13:13,662 --> 0:13:50,59



260
0:13:50,59 --> 0:13:53,89
Despite Justice's revelation
that we're all going to hell,


261
0:13:53,89 --> 0:13:56,77
we return for the finale and
caught up with some fellow


262
0:13:56,77 --> 0:13:58,81
sinners on the red carpet.


263
0:13:58,81 --> 0:14:1,13
Including my favorite,
the stylish


264
0:14:1,13 --> 0:14:4,286
queen mother of Nigeria.


265
0:14:4,286 --> 0:14:5,536
FEMALE SPEAKER: I can tell.


266
0:14:5,536 --> 0:14:8,76



267
0:14:8,76 --> 0:14:12,4
FEMALE SPEAKER: And then, Mr.
Nigeria, Deji Bakare, who


268
0:14:12,4 --> 0:14:15,326
describes himself as a
rapper and a singer.


269
0:14:15,326 --> 0:14:33,71



270
0:14:33,71 --> 0:14:34,96
FEMALE SPEAKER: [LAUGHS].


271
0:14:34,96 --> 0:14:39,0



272
0:14:39,0 --> 0:14:41,886
What I love the most about
Nigeria Fashion Week was how


273
0:14:41,886 --> 0:14:43,83
the designers and models
celebrated


274
0:14:43,83 --> 0:14:46,26
traditional African beauty.


275
0:14:46,26 --> 0:14:49,67
There were no blonde hair
weaves, no plastic surgery,


276
0:14:49,67 --> 0:14:52,5
limited influence by
Western design.


277
0:14:52,5 --> 0:14:57,2
This was truly a celebration
of pure Nigerian beauty.


278
0:14:57,2 --> 0:14:59,77
And backstage, it was
a celebration of


279
0:14:59,77 --> 0:15:1,2
pure Nigerian chaos.


280
0:15:1,2 --> 0:15:7,255



281
0:15:7,255 --> 0:15:11,35
This guy is the winner of
Nigerian Big Brother 2011.


282
0:15:11,35 --> 0:15:14,47
His arrival backstage caused
further chaos, with the


283
0:15:14,47 --> 0:15:17,15
models, their friends and
hangers on all clamoring to


284
0:15:17,15 --> 0:15:19,505
get a private audience
with their idol.


285
0:15:19,505 --> 0:15:27,33



286
0:15:27,33 --> 0:15:29,76
FEMALE SPEAKER: But because this
was the final show and so


287
0:15:29,76 --> 0:15:33,23
much was at state, the head of
security was called to come


288
0:15:33,23 --> 0:15:34,95
and eject him from backstage.


289
0:15:34,95 --> 0:15:37,55
But instead, the security
guy let him off in


290
0:15:37,55 --> 0:15:38,8
exchange for an autograph.


291
0:15:38,8 --> 0:15:41,467



292
0:15:41,467 --> 0:15:45,2
FEMALE SPEAKER: And here he
is thinking about it.


293
0:15:45,2 --> 0:15:47,63
Hm, maybe in a minute.


294
0:15:47,63 --> 0:15:50,28
Nah, I'll just get his autograph
and let him stay.


295
0:15:50,28 --> 0:15:55,22



296
0:15:55,22 --> 0:15:58,45
Despite the general madness,
Nigeria Fashion


297
0:15:58,45 --> 0:15:59,78
Week ended on a high.


298
0:15:59,78 --> 0:16:3,2
But just as we thought our
Nigerian fashion adventure was


299
0:16:3,2 --> 0:16:5,325
over, we were invited to this.


300
0:16:5,325 --> 0:16:9,36

Nigeria's Next Supermodel is
a tribute to Tyra Banks's


302
0:16:12,93 --> 0:16:15,1
America's Next Top Model.


303
0:16:15,1 --> 0:16:17,11
Although we're not really
sure if Tyra's ever


304
0:16:17,11 --> 0:16:19,945
actually seen it.


305
0:16:19,945 --> 0:16:25,101

Miss Nigeria.

JOAN: This is my house
here on the left.


307

bungalow is where we do a lot


308
0:16:33,62 --> 0:16:36,15
of our stuff for the girls.


309
0:16:36,15 --> 0:16:37,827
FEMALE SPEAKER: And they've been
living there, have they?


310
0:16:37,827 --> 0:16:38,581
JOAN: Yeah, yeah.


311
0:16:38,581 --> 0:16:40,541

FEMALE SPEAKER: The dozen or
so finalists in the contest

Lagos, undergoing a sort of


315
0:16:48,4 --> 0:16:50,29
modeling boot camp.


316

Along with her nephew, David.

0:18:18,25 --> 0:18:19,39
Here we are.


323
0:18:19,39 --> 0:18:21,4
We were here to witness
the dreams of one

0:18:21,4 --> 0:18:24,43
young girl come true.


325
0:18:24,43 --> 0:18:27,225

different from


326
0:18:27,225 --> 0:18:28,406
Nigeria Fashion Week.


327
0:18:28,406 --> 0:18:30,417
This is really kind of slick.


328
