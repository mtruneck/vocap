[LOUD BRASSY MUSIC]


10
0:0:41,982 --> 0:0:45,172
NARRATOR: Bill was the town
pariah, the most hated man in


11
0:0:45,172 --> 0:0:47,14
a 20-mile radius.


12
0:0:47,14 --> 0:0:49,37
The reasons for this
were unclear.


13
0:0:49,37 --> 0:0:52,846
Maybe it was because he spent
his youth in and out of jail.


14
0:0:52,846 --> 0:0:55,639
Maybe it was because he fought
and drank and used the Lord's


15
0:0:55,639 --> 0:0:58,762
name in vain without remorse.


16
0:0:58,762 --> 0:1:0,487
Maybe it was because he was the
greatest firefighter the


17
0:1:0,487 --> 0:1:2,706
town had ever seen--


18
0:1:2,706 --> 0:1:5,171
so brave, he made the others
look like cowards.


19
0:1:5,171 --> 0:1:11,87



20
0:1:11,87 --> 0:1:15,31
So they conspired to have him
dishonorably discharged.


21
0:1:15,31 --> 0:1:17,496
But Jane was madly in
love with Bill.


22
0:1:17,496 --> 0:1:21,13
She taught him things she'd
learned at university, like


23
0:1:21,13 --> 0:1:23,26
how wealth redistribution was
the only solution to the


24
0:1:23,26 --> 0:1:24,46
world's problems.


25
0:1:24,46 --> 0:1:26,38
He taught her how
to shoot a gun.


26
0:1:26,38 --> 0:1:30,22



27
0:1:30,22 --> 0:1:32,64
The town was notorious for
the amount of miraculous


28
0:1:32,64 --> 0:1:34,8
interventions that had
occurred there.

he was not fond of Bill.

when the Rapture comes!

sympathizers were

be a good person.

things inside of me.

was Paul Mermelstein, a

me 30 years ago!

0:2:25,417 --> 0:2:26,796
I was gorgeous!


50
0:2:26,796 --> 0:2:29,6
The police would have to escort
me down the street


51
0:2:29,6 --> 0:2:31,965
because the girls literally
would rip the

out the blaze.

And a miracle did occur.

on Bill's axe.


89

There was nothing the

92
0:4:12,4 --> 0:4:17,649
So Paul built him a mechanical
limb, one made of tin.

I could do.

Bill and stood by him.

to normal.

he could find was at the

PAUL: I managed to save your
eyes, your heart, some of your

0:5:51,16 --> 0:5:52,585
other organs.


113
0:5:52,585 --> 0:5:56,93

How they had returned the next
day, walking upright, a

or lungs or heart.


127
0:6:50,165 --> 0:6:52,98



128
0:6:52,98 --> 0:6:56,37
How the pastor had called
it a miracle.


129
0:6:56,37 --> 0:7:0,75
How happy Jane was to have her
man back in some form.


130
0:7:0,75 --> 0:7:2,43
The next day the Tinman
went to see his

want to see you.

FIREFIGHTER: Get
lost, or else.

you damn cowards.

FIREFIGHTER: We found
these in the woods.

TINMAN: She doesn't want
anything to do with me.


139
0:7:33,445 --> 0:7:34,82
I'm hideous.

TINMAN: I feel like
I'm gonna explode.

0:8:12,35 --> 0:8:14,34
How do you make someone
love you again?


144
0:8:14,34 --> 0:8:17,28
What's the noblest thing
you can possibly do?


145
0:8:17,28 --> 0:8:20,888
PAUL: You can steal from the
rich and give to the poor.


146
0:8:20,888 --> 0:8:23,77
TINMAN: All right, I'll do it.


147
0:8:23,77 --> 0:8:27,75
I guess I have nothing
else to lose anyway.

0:8:29,0 --> 0:8:32,49



150
0:8:32,49 --> 0:8:33,88
NARRATOR: So the Tinman
reinvented himself as a


151
0:8:33,88 --> 0:8:38,274
revolutionary in order to
win Jane's affection.


152
0:8:38,274 --> 0:8:42,276
He successfully redistributed
87% of the town's wealth.

PAUL: Stick it to the pigs!


154
0:8:44,76 --> 0:8:46,94

JANE: You don't know that.


157
0:8:50,49 --> 0:8:52,15

have a heart!

TINMAN: I just want
to make you happy.

180
0:9:55,435 --> 0:10:3,4



181
0:10:3,4 --> 0:10:5,81
NARRATOR: Drunk with power,
Paul Murmelstein declared


182
0:10:5,81 --> 0:10:8,766
himself the reincarnation of
John the Baptist and tried to


183
0:10:8,766 --> 0:10:10,2
burn down the church.


184
0:10:10,2 --> 0:10:13,54
The faithful of the town fell
into a persecuting frenzy.


185
0:10:13,54 --> 0:10:15,605
The pastor declared that the
Meat Puppet was sent from Hell


186
0:10:15,605 --> 0:10:19,15
to destroy them all.


187
0:10:19,15 --> 0:10:19,823

-Let him die!

-Yeah!

love this guy?

0:10:38,172 --> 0:10:42,826



198

Let him go!


199

201
0:11:0,21 --> 0:11:6,23



202
0:11:6,23 --> 0:11:8,63
NARRATOR: The Tinman knew the
only way to prove his love for


203
0:11:8,63 --> 0:11:12,13
Jane was to save the life of
the one she truly loved.


204
0:11:12,13 --> 0:11:18,38



205
0:11:18,38 --> 0:11:23,265
He ripped his heart out of his
chest and placed it inside the


206
0:11:23,265 --> 0:11:24,515
Meat Puppet.

0:11:24,515 --> 0:11:40,73

TINMAN: Why are you
still here?


209
0:11:43,7 --> 0:11:44,81
JANE: Because I'm a sinner.


210
0:11:44,81 --> 0:11:47,52
TINMAN: That's what I always
liked about you.


211
0:11:47,52 --> 0:11:49,946
JANE: I still don't love you.


212
