###23 My life is in stages, you know what I mean?
###27 We the jury of in the above-entitled action, find the defendent Calvin Broadus
###31 not guilty of the crime of murder in the first degree.
###34 Whether it's me performing live on stage...
###37 Let me hear you say "Snoop Dogg!" -Snoop Dogg!
###41 Or me going through stages in life.
###44 That's what my life has always been based on.
###47 And that's what forced me to find a new path.
###57 Snoop Dogg is still in Jamaica,
###60 observing and participating in authentic Jamaican culture.
###64 The prodigal son returns.
###72 I've been on the top ever since I've been in it.
###75 I've got rap songs that will never die.
###80 I think with no disrespect, but, I'm tired of rapping.
###84 I wanna do a record, a whole record, with no rapping.
###88 Fuck Snoop Dogg. Don't think about none of the shit he rapped about,
###92 hustling and making money and drug dealing and shooting.
###96 All that shit be out of here.
###108 I didn't just wanna come here, say I made a record in Jamaica
###112 and grew some dreadlocks.
###113 Rastafari called me.
###123 I finally made it to paradise.
###126 Bless up - Snoop Lion!
###129 Jah said to love thee one to another
###130 for him that loveth is of Jah!
