###3 KEVIN MORPURGO: According to Icke, the Isle of Wight is a
###5 world within a world, with Freemasonry and Satanism at
###8 its center.
###9 The ancient lay lines scoring the landscape make it a
###11 powerful spiritual hub.
###13 I think the plan is he's going to show us this stone, which
###17 is part of a old stone circle.
###21 This is the main one where, apparently, Satanic rituals
###23 happen on a regular basis.
###26 
###31 So this is a place here, then, where you think these
###34 rituals-- or you know these rituals--
###35 DAVID ICKE: These rituals definitely go on at
###36 this place up here.
###37 KEVIN MORPURGO: Is this--
###38 DAVID ICKE: It's called the Longstone.
###40 And in fact, it's two stones.
###41 One's on its side and one's standing up.
###43 And it's a beautiful walk, this direction.
###46 KEVIN MORPURGO: Let's go.
###48 After you.
###48 DAVID ICKE: Cheers, mate.
###51 It opens out, eventually, and you get a fantastic view.
###54 It's interesting.
###55 When you look at the traits-- this is mainstream science.
###58 When you look at the traits of what we call the "reptilian
###60 brain," reptilian genetics, which we all have, one of the
###66 traits is an obsession with ritual.
###69 So when you look at all the pomp and ceremony of the royal
###74 family, you know?
###75 With Buckingham Palace and all this stuff, and all the
###78 ceremonies and the guards and the horses and the colors,
###81 you're looking at ritual.
###85 KEVIN MORPURGO: But you say that the people that actually
###87 live on the island are part of this.
###88 There are people--
###90 there's a network on the island that are--
###91 DAVID ICKE: Oh, big time.
###93 I mean, the Isle of Wight's a beautiful place.
###95 And if you pick up the higher levels, the vibrational levels
###99 of it, it's a very pleasant place to be.
###101 But my goodness me, if there is a network of Freemasons,
###106 Satanists, and pedophiles that run this island.
###108 KEVIN MORPURGO: And this is police--
###109 DAVID ICKE: They run its government.
###109 KEVIN MORPURGO: --the government, everything.
###112 We're almost here at the top to see the Long--
###115 DAVID ICKE: Oh, dilly.
###115 KEVIN MORPURGO: There it is.
###117 The Longstone.
###118 DAVID ICKE: There we go.
###119 
###123 It's funny though, you come on a day like this, it's a nice
###126 day, there's families around, and you see these stones.
###129 If you could see these on May 1, Halloween, these ritual
###132 periods of the year--
###133 KEVIN MORPURGO: Then you'd be a totally different story.
###134 DAVID ICKE: You would see something
###135 very different, yeah.
###135 KEVIN MORPURGO: So this is the center point of this energy,
###138 then, that they're trying to tap into?
###141 DAVID ICKE: What they would do, among many other things,
###144 you'd have them in their robes and hoods all around here, and
###148 you'd probably have, or you would have the sacrifice on
###150 the slab here.
###151 KEVIN MORPURGO: This is the altar?
###152 DAVID ICKE: This is their altar, yeah.
###154 And what they're doing--
###156 it's horrible, but let's get the truth out.
###158 What they're doing is manipulating the sacrifice.
###160 The sacrifice knows the sacrifice is coming, and who's
###162 going to help them?
###163 Look.
###163 KEVIN MORPURGO: Right.
###164 DAVID ICKE: At midnight or something.
###165 No one.
###166 And what they then do is they sacrifice the victim and they
###170 drink the blood immediately, which has this chemical
###175 substance in it.
###176 And they go crazy.
###177 I mean, I've talked to people who've been at these rituals,
###180 and how once the sacrifice happens and the blood runs,
###183 these people go crazy with blood.
###184 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###192 DAVID ICKE: There was a man called Stanley Kubrick, the
###195 great filmmaker.
###195 KEVIN MORPURGO: I think I've heard of him.
###196 DAVID ICKE: Stanley Kubrick was an insider, and he wanted
###199 to expose it.
###200 And his last movie was called Eyes Wide Shut.
###203 KEVIN MORPURGO: I've seen it.
###203 Yes.
###203 DAVID ICKE: Now, Eyes Wide Shut, he died very, very soon
###208 after it was presented to
###210 executives at the film company.
###211 And was given no fanfare whatsoever when it came out--
###214 KEVIN MORPURGO: They maybe edited the hell
###214 out of it as well.
###215 DAVID ICKE: Yes, they did.
###216 They took 25 minutes out of it, which he refused to do.
###218 Now, he filmed a ritual with Tom Cruise in it, in which I
###224 only know more recently was a Rothschild mansion.
###227 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###230 DAVID ICKE: And what he filmed is a mild, mild version of
###235 what goes on.
###236 Because he knew.
###238 And you had the colors.
###239 You have most people in the ritual in Eyes Wide
###242 Shut were in black.
###243 The main guy was in red.
###244 Here we go again.
###246 You had the orgies going on, and you had the people being
###249 killed, the lady being killed.
###250 But that was such a mild version.
###252 I don't know what was in the 25 minutes
###253 they took out, mind.
###255 Because the real version is that there's blood
###257 every-bloody-where.
###260 We see a hierarchy in the public arena of presidents,
###264 secretaries of state, of prime ministers, secretaries of
###266 state, down, down, down, down.
###268 That's the public hierarchy.
###269 The real hierarchy, in the shadows,
###271 is the occult hierarchy.
###273 And if you're higher in the occult hierarchy, the satanic
###276 hierarchy-- which is incredibly hierarchical, it's
###278 all hierarchical--
###279 then you have more power over someone higher than you in the
###282 public hierarchy.
###284 KEVIN MORPURGO: You know, people familiar with your work
###285 would know that you've made some predictions over the
###288 years, and they've come to pass.
###291 I mean, I think this may be part of the reason why people
###293 are really starting to pick up on your work.
###295 Something like the internet.
###296 What do you see--
###297 because at the moment, this is how people are getting
###299 information spread to each other.
###302 It seems, at least at the moment, to be relatively free
###304 in most countries.
###305 What do you see happening there?
###306 DAVID ICKE: The big thing that they're going to say is
###309 because of the danger of terrorism and terrorists
###313 communicating on the internet, these
###315 things have to be stopped.
###318 I mean, what did Cameron say after the London riots?
###320 We may have to talk about
###322 censoring Twitter and Facebook.
###326 And Bill Clinton--
###327 and when Bill Clinton, like Tony Blair or George Bush or
###330 anybody, when they open their mouths, it's
###332 the Rothschilds speaking.
###334 And just a few months ago, Bill Clinton came out and
###337 said, we need, basically, a censor organization, a
###342 Ministry of Truth, to police the internet and to stop
###347 people-- he specifically talked about people who were
###350 spreading rumors on the internet that are not true.
###352 They are true, Bill, OK?
###354 They're in my books.
###355 There's documentaries about it.
###356 They're true.
###357 Go away.
###358 Drink your milk.
###360 [MUSIC PLAYING]
###365 KEVIN MORPURGO: Do people just turn up at your door, though?
###367 I'm sure you have fans that--
###368 DAVID ICKE: Well, they do.
###370 I hope they're not fans.
###371 I hope they're not followers, or they're not listening.
###373 But yeah, I have people come quite a lot from time to time.
###377 I'm a very private person, you see.
###380 It's one of the strange things about my life, really.
###382 I'd guess you'd call it a paradox, but I don't suppose
###385 it is, really.
###386 And that's that almost everything I've done in my
###390 life has been a public profession.
###391 I was a footballer.
###393 Then I became a journalist and television presenter.
###395 Then I was a national spokesman for the Green Party.
###397 Then I did this, of course.
###399 And yet I'm an incredibly private person.
###402 And I talk to thousands at an event, and I love it.
###405 I just love being there.
###407 It's like being in another reality.
###408 There's a massive interaction going on energetically between
###413 the audience and me.
###414 You feel what humanity is behind the programming and
###418 behind the false sense of limitation, and I
###424 Can't and Little Me.
###426 You feel the true magnitude of what we are
###430 coming off the audience.
###431 What we need is not compliance.
###434 We need a non-comply dance, where we beat to a different
###439 drum and we dance to a different drum.
###442 Where we refuse to acquiesce to this control system that
###446 seeks to enslave us even more than it already has.
###449 Non-comply dance.
###452 Do this.
###453 Comply.
###455 No.
###457 No.
###458 Enough.
###459 It's time to fly.
###461 It's time to fly.
###463 Thank you very much.
###465 [CHEERING AND APPLAUSE]
###467 DAVID ICKE: Thank you.
###469 It's funny, Kev, you know.
###471 You brought me here, and it's kind of a real strange,
###475 spooky, surreal feeling, because I used to stand here.
###479 I was a little boy.
###480 I could just about see over the top of this bloody fence.
###483 Same fence.
###484 Think it is, anyway, repainted.
###486 And I used to watch the steam trains come up.
###488 And I wanted to be a footballer and I wanted--
###492 I love steam trains and all the rest of it.
###494 And nearly 60 years later, I'm standing in the same spot and
###500 I've been talking to you about a moon bloody matrix,
###503 shape-shifting reptilians, a few families
###505 run the bloody world.
###506 I mean, whatever happened to you?
###510 Just keep watching the steam trains.
###512 Look at the trouble you've got me into.
###515 And it's just as strange, where life goes.
###517 You never know where it goes, so all you can do
###519 is enjoy the moment.
###520 And I love this moment, this moment when I was watching
###523 those steam trains, I was in my heaven.
###526 And standing here, I'm in another kind of heaven,
###529 because given what happened 20 years ago and
###533 many years after that--
###534 I was ridiculed in the street, called a nutter, and I
###539 couldn't fill a phone box.
###540 And now, suddenly, it's so different.
###542 It just shows that if you keep walking, and keep walking,
###546 believing what you're doing, then something comes
###548 out the other end.
###549 And it's just beginning to.
###552 KEVIN MORPURGO: Even within conspiracy circles, David Icke
###554 is a controversial figure.
###557 Many view him as a harmless eccentric, while others claim
###559 he must be an agent provocateur, discrediting
###561 conspiracies by mixing documented fact with wild
###564 allegations of rapist reptilians and their
###566 artificial moon base.
###568 Maybe they're just jealous.
###570 Icke has sold over 20 million books worldwide, while his
###572 website is an iconic forum for the global esoteric community,
###575 with over four million views a month.
###579 So this is David Icke--
###580 visionary, multimillion-selling author,
###583 global icon, one-time messiah, former goalkeeper, and the
###587 single greatest threat to the lizard apocalypse.
###590 Good luck, my friend.
