###1 A study shows that unshaved men can detect bed bugs better than women,
###7 proving evolution. Potholer needs to be FILLED IN on
###12 thermodynamics And we open a few letter bombs from our
###14 viewers - all this and more, coming up in this edition of Genesis Week.
###18 <music>
###34 And a welcome to this episode of Genesis Week, the weekly program of creationary
###39 commentary on news, views and events pertaining to the origins controversy,
###44 exclusive right here on youtube.  The Bible does not say "Be ye transformed by the
###49 removal of your mind" but rather we here at Genesis Week believe God gave you a
###54 brain for a reason, and so we use our brains in search of the truth.

###73 A December 14th "Biology Letters" paper by Isabelle Dean and Michael T.
###78 Siva-Jothy reported the results of an experiment where they shaved the
###83 armpits of men and women to see if they could detect bed bugs better.
###87 <laughing>Ya can't make this stuff up. Now of course, in order to get research
###94 funding, you must give a nod to evolution, and your results MUST support
###98 evolution....even if the results don't support evolution. For example, in the
###105 abstract we read:
###124 Talk about a stretch!  Our lack of hair is really unexplainable by evolutionary
###130 theory, so we must find some advantage of the lack of human hair to offer an
###135 evolutionary explanation!
###137 So what did they find? Well, I like the way Bob Yirka at physorg.com put it:
###166 Wwwwooowwww...  This report has the potential to affect online dating site
###171 profile photos for men, as clearly ladies are after the hairiest guy out there.
###176 After all, based on this scientific report, that's what you ladies are after - a hairy
###182 guy which means he's bed-bug free, right?
###184 This is just another example of how far people will reach to make alleged
###188 "benefits" to be alleged "evidence for evolution."  Even when evolution really
###194 cannot explain the evidence - like in this case, the lack of fur on humans.  But it
###199 sure makes a funny story!
###201 youtuber Potholer54 recently posted a video "setting fire to creationist straw
###206 men" - which really strikes me as ironic, as he delved into trying to debunk
###210 thermodynamics and subsequently burned himself so bad. Potholer definitely
###215 needs to be "filled in" on what thermodynamics is, and in fact, I'll have a
###219 rant coming out shortly, mostly devoted to his video because while his discussion
###224 of thermodynamics was SO bad and so full of flagrant, gross error, sadly, his
###231 response was typical of the anti-creationary community.  But I bring
###235 that up, along with the snowflakes that potholer mentioned, because Nature
###239 magazine also had an article come out on the incredible variety snowflakes can
###243 produce.... and just because it's winter here in Canada.  What a better time to deal
###246 with what we creationists refer to as "the stupid snowflake argument."
###251 That's right - the claim is that incredibly complex snowflakes can form, therefore
###257 the laws of entropy (or disorder) are "violated," therefore we can conclude that
###262 life can arise from non-life. Of course, potholer first pulled the "open
###267 systems" argument, claiming that energy coming in from the sun can cause life to
###272 arise - and then cites snowflakes and sunflowers as examples.  This makes it
###279 evident that potholer doesn't have a CLUE what he's talking about. First of all, as I
###283 already pointed out in a previous rant, "closed thermodynamic systems" do not
###287 exist!  The well established laws of thermodynamics were formed to describe
###292 what happens in open systems. So why then would potholer talk about
###297 closed systems? I can only think of two possible reasons: Ignorance, or
###302 obfuscation.
###304 Snowflakes form by cooling, yet potholer was calling upon energy from the sun to
###309 magically defy disorder.  Energy from the sun plays a role in evaporation of water,
###314 yes, but energy from the sun melts snowflakes.
###318 Then potholer takes a quantum leap of faith, comparing a snowflake to the
###323 sunflower!  What???  That's like saying that because a rock formed by natural
###330 processes, we can therefore conclude that the space shuttle can form by natural
###335 processes!  And even that crude comparison doesn't do it justice, because
###340 the space shuttle cannot reproduce, cannot repair itself, cannot find and
###344 process its own energy, etc...  Do you know what the odds are that the space
###349 shuttle could form by natural processes? It's quite easy to calculate actually - the
###354 odds are ZERO that the space shuttle could form by natural processes, and so
###358 goes even the very proteins that the sunflower needs in order to live.  But to be
###365 honest, perhaps we should temper those odds with the fact that Kim Jong ill got 11
###369 holes in one on his first game of golf.  Ya, I don't believe that either.
###376 Snowflakes most certainly do follow the laws of thermodynamics and entropy, and
###381 snowflakes have absolutely nothing to do with life forming from non-life.
###388 <scary music> Wahoo! Mail for me?
###395 <scary music>
###400 I wanted to give a special thank you to all of my subscribers and viewers - thanks
###403 for watching, and thanks for commenting. Please know, that while I try and read
###407 comments, I typically can't get to responding to them, as my videos get just
###411 waaay too many comments.  However, I will try to highlight some of your
###416 comments here and there, especially on Genesis Week.
###419 One youtube skeptic, apparently not wanting to make his statements
###423 publically, wrote to me privately.  He was critical of my second pilot Genesis week
###427 episode, criticizing me for allegedly not knowing that dinosaurs ARE considered
###432 to be birds.  I'm well aware of said claim, however, apparently you missed my point,
###437 so let me make it again:  Calling a dinosaur a bird does not make it a bird!  <swoosh>
###445 <T-rex clucking like a chicken> Bagaack!
###457 <swoosh> Citing cladistic diagrams is completely
###460 bogus, because it's easy to show just how flexible "cladistics" are to
###465 accomodate the current favourite evolutionary theory - in fact I wrote about
###469 this on my blog where some evolutionism thinkers were arguing over whether a
###474 hippo was most like a whale, a pig, or a dog!  And they get paid for this!
###483 Oh, and by the way, there are multiple, well-respected EVOLUTIONARY scientists
###489 who disagree with you and claim that dinosaurs are not birds, they believe birds
###493 evolved separate from the dinosaurs.  So much for cladistics.
###498 I just released another CrEvo Rant on the origin of life and evolution.  You can click
###502 on the video here and go watch it right now, or the video will be provided again at
###506 the end of this program.
###508 In response to that video, Truthseeker1973 wrote in:
###534 JMcH: A person of very skilled in saying a lot in a very few words, put it succintly:

###543 Thanks for writing in folks.
###545 The trolls were hard at work again, flaunting their flagrant ignorance on so
###548 many subjects that I felt like the last male rabbit in a world of female rabbits during
###552 mating season - wherever do I begin? Most of the skeptical comments are really
###557 not even worthy of a response.  However, some of you viewers stepped in with your
###561 comments: In response to
###563 Thepseudosciencefoundation's flagrantly ignorant comments on the alleged genetic
###568 similarities between humans and chimps, TubeNotMe wrote:
###595 You're right on the money. The differences between humans and chimps
###599 are far beyond the genetic, but even just the genetic differences are fatal to the
###603 evolutionary model. For example, thepseudosciencefoundation never
###608 mentions orfan genes, which are a 0% match between chimps and humans - and
###614 there's hundreds of orfan genes!  Thanks for writing in Tubenotme, and for the rest
###618 of you viewers, I happened to discuss this very subject in my last newsletter, which
###622 you can read here.  Sign up for my newsletters here.
###626 Well, I'm trying to keep these programs short, so I better sign off here for now.
###629 Don't forget, there's only a few days left to get your video entry in to the Epic
###633 Evolution Pwnage contest. I'm your host, Ian Juby, hey - there's a convenient
###638 subscribe link right there!  Don't miss a single rant or show - subscribe to my
