1
0:0:19,1 --> 0:0:20,367
>> ELECTRICITY POWERS JUST ABOUT
EVERYTHING IN OUR LIVES.


2
0:0:20,367 --> 0:0:21,0
BUT WHERE DOES IT COME FROM?


3
0:0:21,0 --> 0:0:22,533
AND HOW DOES ELECTRICITY WORK?


4
0:0:22,533 --> 0:0:24,8
WE'RE STANDING BY TO ANSWER YOUR
QUESTIONS.


5
0:0:24,8 --> 0:0:25,7
STAY TUNED.


6
0:0:25,7 --> 0:0:40,6
"D4K" IS NEXT.


7
0:0:40,6 --> 0:0:42,533
>> HI, I'M JOAN CARTAN-HANSEN,
WELCOME TO "D4K."


8
0:0:42,533 --> 0:0:44,0
THE PLACE FOR SCIENCE.


9
0:0:44,0 --> 0:0:46,333
>>> BEFORE WE GO TO YOUR
QUESTION, LET'S LEARN A LITTLE


10
0:0:46,333 --> 0:0:50,8
BIT MORE ABOUT ELECTRICITY.


11
0:0:50,8 --> 0:0:53,367
WHEN YOU TURN ON A LAMP,
ELECTRICITY FLOWS.


12
0:0:53,367 --> 0:0:57,166
AND TURNS IT INTO LIGHT AND HEAT
HEAT.


13
0:0:57,166 --> 0:0:59,567
THE ELECTRICITY WE USE IN OUR
HOMES AND SCHOOLS STARTS AT A


14
0:0:59,567 --> 0:1:0,433
POWER PLANT.


15
0:1:0,433 --> 0:1:3,266
HERE IN IDAHO, A LOT OF
ELECTRICITY COMES FROM


16
0:1:3,266 --> 0:1:5,8
HYDROELECTRIC POWER.


17
0:1:5,8 --> 0:1:10,0
THESE PLANTS USE WATER TO TURN A
TURBINE IN A GENERATOR, WHICH IS


18
0:1:10,0 --> 0:1:14,533
BASICALLY A BIG MAGNET
SURROUNDED BY A COIL OF COPPER


19
0:1:14,533 --> 0:1:14,867
WIRE.


20
0:1:14,867 --> 0:1:18,166
AS THE MAGNET SPINS IT PRODUCES
ELECTRICITY.


21
0:1:18,166 --> 0:1:22,66
NOW ELECTRICITY DOESN'T DO YOU
MUCH GOOD UNTIL IT MOVES.


22
0:1:22,66 --> 0:1:25,533
ELECTRICITY FLOWING THROUGH
WIRES IS CALLED AN ELECTRIC


23
0:1:25,533 --> 0:1:25,967
CURRENT.


24
0:1:25,967 --> 0:1:28,66
ELECTRICITY JUST WON'T FLOW
THROUGH ANYTHING.


25
0:1:28,66 --> 0:1:31,633
SOME MATERIALS CONDUCT
ELECTRICITY BETTER THAN OTHERS.


26
0:1:31,633 --> 0:1:34,433
ELECTRICITY CAN'T GO THROUGH
PLASTIC OR RUBBER, THOSE THINGS


27
0:1:34,433 --> 0:1:36,6
ARE KNOWN AS INSULATORS.


28
0:1:36,6 --> 0:1:40,166
THINGS LIKE METAL WIRES ARE
CALLED CONDUCTORS.


29
0:1:40,166 --> 0:1:43,8
ONCE ELECTRICITY IS GENERATED AT
THE POWER PLANT, IT FLOWS TO


30
0:1:43,8 --> 0:1:46,0
YOUR HOME OR SCHOOL OVER WIRES.


31
0:1:46,0 --> 0:1:49,734
ALL THE WIRES TOGETHER ARE KNOWN
AS A GRID.


32
0:1:49,734 --> 0:1:52,533
POWER COMPANIES ACROSS THE
COUNTRY WORK TOGETHER TO MAKE


33
0:1:52,533 --> 0:1:55,433
SURE THE POWER GRID IS FULL AND
FLOWING.


34
0:1:55,433 --> 0:2:1,333
THAT WAY WHEN YOU TURN ON YOUR
TV, ELECTRICITY POWERS IT UP.


35
0:2:1,333 --> 0:2:3,734
YOU CAN FIND ELECTRICITY IN
OTHER PLACES.


36
0:2:3,734 --> 0:2:8,166
IN 1752, BENJAMIN FRANKLIN
PROVED THUNDER CLOUDS CONTAIN


37
0:2:8,166 --> 0:2:8,6
ELECTRICITY.


38
0:2:8,6 --> 0:2:15,66
YOU KNOW IT AS LIGHTNING.


39
0:2:15,66 --> 0:2:17,166
STATIC ELECTRICITY IS AROUND ALL
OF US.


40
0:2:17,166 --> 0:2:20,266
IT'S CAUSED BY FRICTION, LIKE
WHEN YOU RUB TWO SURFACES


41
0:2:20,266 --> 0:2:20,6
TOGETHER.


42
0:2:20,6 --> 0:2:22,9
HAVE YOU EVER BEEN SHOCKED?


43
0:2:22,9 --> 0:2:24,8
THAT'S STATIC ELECTRICITY.


44
0:2:24,8 --> 0:2:26,9
THERE'S ELECTRICITY IN
BATTERIES, WE EVEN HAVE


45
0:2:26,9 --> 0:2:28,433
ELECTRICITY IN OUR BODIES.


46
0:2:28,433 --> 0:2:32,266
BUT DON'T FORGET, ELECTRICITY
CAN HURT YOU, TOO.


47
0:2:32,266 --> 0:2:34,9
DON'T GET NEAR DOWNED POWER
LINES, DON'T PLAY WITH ELECTRIC


48
0:2:34,9 --> 0:2:39,433
WIRES IN YOUR HOUSE, AND STAY
INSIDE WHEN THERE'S LIGHTNING.


49
0:2:39,433 --> 0:2:48,8
ELECTRICITY IS A FORCE TO
RESPECT.


50
0:2:48,8 --> 0:2:51,734
>> AND JOINING ME NOW TO ANSWER
YOUR QUESTIONS ABOUT ELECTRICITY


51
0:2:51,734 --> 0:2:55,9
ARE JOHN GARDNER, PROFESSOR OF
MECHANICAL AND BIOMEDICAL


52
0:2:55,9 --> 0:2:57,7

0:2:57,7 --> 0:3:1,8
HE ALSO LEADS THE ENERGY
RESEARCH INSTITUTE.


54
0:3:1,8 --> 0:3:4,266
AND KIP SIKES, OPERATION
ANALYSIS AND DEVELOPMENT MANAGER


55
0:3:4,266 --> 0:3:5,433
FOR IDAHO POWER.


56
0:3:5,433 --> 0:3:7,333
THANK YOU BOTH FOR BEING HERE.


57
0:3:7,333 --> 0:3:9,266
APPRECIATE YOU JOINING US.


58
0:3:9,266 --> 0:3:13,166
JOINING US HERE IN STUDIO A AT
IDAHO PUBLIC TELEVISION ARE THE


59
0:3:13,166 --> 0:3:18,166
STUDENTS OF THE THIRD, FOURTH
GRADE CLASS.


60
0:3:18,166 --> 0:3:19,5
THANKS FOR BEING HERE!


61
0:3:19,5 --> 0:3:25,633
LET'S GO TO YOUR QUESTIONS.


62
0:3:25,633 --> 0:3:30,333
>> HI, MY NAME IS JOEL AND MY
QUESTION IS, HOW MUCH --


63
0:3:30,333 --> 0:3:35,66
WHAT ABOUT ELECTRICITY DOES THE
AVERAGE U.S. PERSON USE IN A


64
0:3:35,66 --> 0:3:35,633
WEEK?


65
0:3:35,633 --> 0:3:38,867
>> JOEL, THE AMOUNT OF
ELECTRICITY, THE AVERAGE


66
0:3:38,867 --> 0:3:41,633
HOUSEHOLD USES IS JUST THINK OF
A HORSE.


67
0:3:41,633 --> 0:3:44,0
WE THINK IN TERMS OF HORSEPOWER.


68
0:3:44,0 --> 0:3:51,433
SO ON AVERAGE, A HOUSEHOLD USES
1.6 HORSES EVERY SECOND.


69
0:3:51,433 --> 0:3:55,333
SO JUST THINK OF THAT AS A
CONSTANT HORSE RIDING AROUND,


70
0:3:55,333 --> 0:3:57,7
THAT'S ABOUT HOW MUCH
ELECTRICITY YOU'RE USING ALL THE


71
0:3:57,7 --> 0:4:0,867
TIME.


72
0:4:0,867 --> 0:4:4,9
>> BRIAN ASKS, HOW DO CLOUDS GET
ELECTRICITY?


73
0:4:4,9 --> 0:4:7,533
>> SO RYAN, I ASSUME YOU'RE
TALKING ABOUT LIGHTNING THAT


74
0:4:7,533 --> 0:4:8,333
COMES FROM CLOUDS.


75
0:4:8,333 --> 0:4:11,633
THIS IS A NATURAL PHENOMENON
THAT HAPPENS AS THE CLOUDS MOVE


76
0:4:11,633 --> 0:4:12,967
THROUGH THE AIR.


77
0:4:12,967 --> 0:4:16,734
THE ATOMS AND MOLECULES IN THE
AIR AND THE WATER AND THE CLOUDS


78
0:4:16,734 --> 0:4:19,9
HAVE FREE ELECTRONS AND THEY GET
EXCHANGED AS THE CLOUDS MOVE


79
0:4:19,9 --> 0:4:21,367
THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERE.


80
0:4:21,367 --> 0:4:24,8
AND THE ELECTRONS BUILD UP ON
THE CLOUDS, AND THEY NEED


81
0:4:24,8 --> 0:4:27,266
EVENTUALLY AFTER A LITTLE WHILE
HAVE TO MEET --


82
0:4:27,266 --> 0:4:28,333
NEED A PLACE TO GO.


83
0:4:28,333 --> 0:4:31,266
AND THEY'LL GO TO THE CLOSEST
SPOT THAT'S OF A DIFFERENT


84
0:4:31,266 --> 0:4:35,0
CHARGE LEVEL, AND THAT'S USUALLY
WHY LIGHTNING WILL HIT A TREE OR


85
0:4:35,0 --> 0:4:36,0
A TALL HIM.


86
0:4:36,0 --> 0:4:40,0
IT HAPPENS IN THE ATMOSPHERE AS
A COURSE OF EVERYDAY EVENTS.


87
0:4:40,0 --> 0:4:43,533
>> MY NAME IS MEGAN AND MY
QUESTION IS, HOW DOES


88
0:4:43,533 --> 0:4:46,233
ELECTRICITY TRAVEL?


89
0:4:46,233 --> 0:4:50,266
>> MEGAN, THE WAY ELECTRICITY
TRAVELS IS REALLY THERE'S MORE


90
0:4:50,266 --> 0:4:52,0
THAN ONE WAY TO MAKE IT TRAVEL.


91
0:4:52,0 --> 0:4:55,333
BUT NORMALLY WHAT WE THINK OF
TRAVELING THROUGH A CONDUCTOR OR


92
0:4:55,333 --> 0:4:59,734
A WIRE IS THE ELECTRONS WILL
BOUNCE ALONG AND PUSH EACH OTHER


93
0:4:59,734 --> 0:5:0,66
ALONG.


94
0:5:0,66 --> 0:5:3,66
BUT ANOTHER WAY TO MAKE
ELECTRICITY TRAVEL IS WHAT WE


95
0:5:3,66 --> 0:5:6,433
HAVE IN A LOT OF THE TECHNOLOGY
THAT WE USE TODAY.


96
0:5:6,433 --> 0:5:8,0
IT'S CALLED A BATTERY.


97
0:5:8,0 --> 0:5:11,433
SO ELECTRICITY CAN BE STORED AND
MOVED AROUND AND TRAVEL THAT


98
0:5:11,433 --> 0:5:16,633
WAY, BUT REALLY FOR ELECTRICITY
TO FLOW YOU NEED A CIRCUIT,


99
0:5:16,633 --> 0:5:19,867
WHICH MEANS IT HAS TO BE A
COMPLETE CONNECTION CIRCLE ALL


100
0:5:19,867 --> 0:5:22,7
THE WAY AROUND TO THE SOURCE.


101
0:5:22,7 --> 0:5:25,867
>> MY NAME IS CHARLOTTE AND MY
QUESTION IS, WHEN WAS


102
0:5:25,867 --> 0:5:30,633
ELECTRICITY DISCOVERED?


103
0:5:30,633 --> 0:5:32,66
>> SO WE'RE NOT SURE.


104
0:5:32,66 --> 0:5:33,967
I THINK IS THE SHORT ANSWER TO
THAT QUESTION.


105
0:5:33,967 --> 0:5:36,6
BUT THERE'S A LOT OF
EXPERIMENTS, A LOT OF


106
0:5:36,6 --> 0:5:39,8
UNDERSTANDING ABOUT ELECTRICITY
THAT CAME ABOUT IN EUROPE IN THE


107
0:5:39,8 --> 0:5:40,1
1700s.


108
0:5:40,1 --> 0:5:44,367
SOME OF THE SCIENTISTS WHO DID
THIS WORK IN THEIR LABORATORIES


109
0:5:44,367 --> 0:5:47,9
HAD THE NAMES THAT WOULD NOW
COME ALONG WITH ELECTRICITY.


110
0:5:47,9 --> 0:5:52,333
SO THERE WAS AN ITALIAN
SCIENTIST NAMED VOLTA, AND WE


111
0:5:52,333 --> 0:5:54,333
NAMED VOLT AFTER HIM.


112
0:5:54,333 --> 0:5:59,633
ANOTHER FRENCH SCIENTIST NAMED
AMPIER WHO GIVES HIS NAME TO


113
0:5:59,633 --> 0:5:59,934
CURRENT.


114
0:5:59,934 --> 0:6:3,0
SO THERE WAS A LOT OF
EXPERIMENTS, STARTED MOSTLY WITH


115
0:6:3,0 --> 0:6:6,734
STATIC ELECTRICITY, WITH PIECES
OF GLASS AND VARIOUS KINDS OF


116
0:6:6,734 --> 0:6:9,633
PLASTICS AND WOOL AND COTTON AND
THINGS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW


117
0:6:9,633 --> 0:6:13,166
TO MAKE THOSE LITTLE SPARKS THAT
WE NOW SEE WHEN WE RUB OUR FEET


118
0:6:13,166 --> 0:6:15,66
ACROSS THE CARPET.


119
0:6:15,66 --> 0:6:16,633
AND THAT EVOLVED OVER TIME.


120
0:6:16,633 --> 0:6:20,7
SO IT WAS OVER HUNDREDS OF YEARS
FROM THERE TO CREATING A MACHINE


121
0:6:20,7 --> 0:6:23,266
THAT IF YOU TURNED, COULD MAKE
ELECTRICITY.


122
0:6:23,266 --> 0:6:25,967
AND THAT'S --
WE CALL THAT A GENERATOR, AND


123
0:6:25,967 --> 0:6:29,0
THAT HAPPENED THROUGH TO
PROBABLY THE BEGINNING OF OUR


124
0:6:29,0 --> 0:6:31,8
ELECTRIC GRID, THE MODERN
ELECTRIC GRID, WHICH WAS THE


125
0:6:31,8 --> 0:6:36,266
LATE 1800s WITH OF ALL PEOPLE
THOMAS EDISON WAS THE FIRST ONE


126
0:6:36,266 --> 0:6:39,0
TO CREATE ELECTRICITY, PUT IT ON
A GRID AND SELL IT TO PEOPLE IN


127
0:6:39,0 --> 0:6:41,0
NEW YORK CITY.


128
0:6:41,0 --> 0:6:43,8
>> IS THAT GRID IN USE TODAY?


129
0:6:43,8 --> 0:6:48,0
WAS IT THE ONE DAMAGED SO BADLY
BY SUPER STORM SANDY?


130
0:6:48,0 --> 0:6:49,7
>> NOT EXACTLY.


131
0:6:49,7 --> 0:6:52,8
SO THAT ACTUALLY OPEN AS VERY
INTERESTING PIECE OF OUR HISTORY


132
0:6:52,8 --> 0:6:53,7
OF TECHNOLOGY.


133
0:6:53,7 --> 0:6:57,333
BECAUSE EDISON CREATED THIS GRID
USING A GENERATOR THAT CREATED


134
0:6:57,333 --> 0:6:59,567
DIRECT CURRENT, OR D.C. CURRENT.


135
0:6:59,567 --> 0:7:2,8
THERE WERE OTHER SCIENTISTS,
OTHER ENGINEERS WHO THOUGHT THEY


136
0:7:2,8 --> 0:7:8,166
HAD A BETTER IDEA AND IT WAS
GEORGE WESTINGHOUSE AND 96


137
0:7:8,166 --> 0:7:10,9
LA TESS LA AND THEY THOUGHT IT
WOULD BE BETTER TO USE


138
0:7:10,9 --> 0:7:11,367
ALTERNATING CURRENT.


139
0:7:11,367 --> 0:7:13,533
AND THERE WAS A BIG FIGHT FOR
DECADES.


140
0:7:13,533 --> 0:7:18,166
THEY USED PUBLIC RELATIONS AND A
LOT OF PRETTY NASTY TACTICS.


141
0:7:18,166 --> 0:7:21,533
YOU THINK OUR POLITICS ARE BAD,
YOU SHOULD READ ABOUT WHAT THOSE


142
0:7:21,533 --> 0:7:22,333
GUYS WERE DOING.


143
0:7:22,333 --> 0:7:26,533
IN THE END WESTINGHOUSE WON AND
WE HAVE AN A.C. GRID BECAUSE OF


144
0:7:26,533 --> 0:7:26,967
THAT.


145
0:7:26,967 --> 0:7:28,734
BECAUSE THE TECHNOLOGY WORKS
BETTER FOR THAT.


146
0:7:28,734 --> 0:7:31,7
THOUGH THERE'S SOME PEOPLE
LOOKING AT D.C. AGAIN THINKING


147
0:7:31,7 --> 0:7:35,66
THERE MIGHT BE THINGS THAT WORK
BETTER FOR THAT TOO.


148
0:7:35,66 --> 0:7:37,9
>> TYLER ASKS, HOW DOES
ELECTRICITY END UP IN


149
0:7:37,9 --> 0:7:39,8
EVERYBODY'S HOMES?


150
0:7:39,8 --> 0:7:43,0
>> TYLER, THE WAY ELECTRICITY
GETS TO YOUR HOME IS THROUGH A


151
0:7:43,0 --> 0:7:44,433
SERIES OF WIRES.


152
0:7:44,433 --> 0:7:47,867
IT COMES FROM A GENERATOR
OBVIOUSLY AND THAT HAS WIRES IN


153
0:7:47,867 --> 0:7:51,533
IT, AND WHERE IT'S PRODUCED THEN
IT'S MOVED THROUGH THE SYSTEM,


154
0:7:51,533 --> 0:7:55,367
IN MANY CASES BETWEEN STATES, OR
THROUGHOUT THE REGION.


155
0:7:55,367 --> 0:7:59,3
AND THE GRID AS IT'S CALLED, THE
ELECTRICAL GRID, IS A CONNECTION


156
0:7:59,3 --> 0:8:4,166
OF ALL OF THESE WIRES THAT MOVES
ELECTRICITY AROUND THE WESTERN


157
0:8:4,166 --> 0:8:8,166
UNITED STATES, AND THOSE WIRES
CONNECT ALL THE WAY TO THE


158
0:8:8,166 --> 0:8:10,8
COMMUNITIES THAT YOU LIVE IN,
AND THEN WIRES ALL THE WAY TO


159
0:8:10,8 --> 0:8:11,533
YOUR HOUSE.


160
0:8:11,533 --> 0:8:16,66
SO THE REALLY NEAT THING IS,
IT'S ALL TOUCHING WIRES, IF YOU


161
0:8:16,66 --> 0:8:20,266
COULD GET REALLY SMALL AND CRAWL
INTO THAT OUTLET, YOU COULD GO


162
0:8:20,266 --> 0:8:24,533
TO ANYONE ELSE'S HOUSE THAT HAS
ELECTRICITY AS WELL.


163
0:8:24,533 --> 0:8:30,0
>> HI, MY NAME IS YOSHI, AND MY
QUESTION S. HOW FAST CAN


164
0:8:30,0 --> 0:8:32,433
ELECTRICITY TRAVEL THROUGH
WATER?


165
0:8:32,433 --> 0:8:34,233
>> THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION.


166
0:8:34,233 --> 0:8:37,8
AND THE ANSWER IS YOU KNOW, LIKE
A LOT OF THINGS, IT DEPENDS.


167
0:8:37,8 --> 0:8:40,9
IF IT'S PURE WATER WITHOUT ANY
IMPURITYING, THE ELECTRICITY


168
0:8:40,9 --> 0:8:43,0
WON'T TRAVEL THROUGH IT AT ALL.


169
0:8:43,0 --> 0:8:46,7
IT CAN'T, BECAUSE IT ACTS AS AN
INSULATOR.


170
0:8:46,7 --> 0:8:49,9
BUT SMALL IMPURITIES LIKE WE
FIND IN TAP WATER OR THE WATER


171
0:8:49,9 --> 0:8:53,734
IN OUR RIVERS, IT WILL CONDUCT
ELECTRICITY.


172
0:8:53,734 --> 0:8:57,433
AND THE MORE IMPURITY AND
PARTICULARLY THINGS LIKE SALT


173
0:8:57,433 --> 0:8:59,633
ARE REALLY GOOD AT CONDUCTING
ELECTRICITY.


174
0:8:59,633 --> 0:9:3,6
AND IT WILL ALLOW MORE AND MORE
ELECTRICITY TO MOVE THROUGH IT.


175
0:9:3,6 --> 0:9:6,7
BUT AS WE MENTIONED EARLIER,
WHEN ELECTRICITY FLOWS, IT


176
0:9:6,7 --> 0:9:9,233
PRETTY MUCH FLOWS AT THE SAME
SPEED, WHICH IS CLOSE TO THE


177
0:9:9,233 --> 0:9:13,7
SPEED OF LIGHT, WHICH IS VERY,
VERY FAST.


178
0:9:13,7 --> 0:9:17,233
>> OWEN ASKS, WHY IS IT WHEN YOU
RUB YOUR FEET ACROSS THE CARPET,


179
0:9:17,233 --> 0:9:19,433
YOU MAKE ELECTRICITY?


180
0:9:19,433 --> 0:9:22,7
>> WELL, OWEN, I THINK WE'VE ALL
DONE THAT AND SNUCK UP AND


181
0:9:22,7 --> 0:9:26,367
SHOCKED SOMEBODY, BUT THE WAY IT
WORKS AGAIN IS STATIC


182
0:9:26,367 --> 0:9:26,7
ELECTRICITY.


183
0:9:26,7 --> 0:9:31,633
BY RUBBING YOUR FEET ACROSS THE
CARPET, YOUR SHOES ACT AS


184
0:9:31,633 --> 0:9:36,633
INSULATORS, AND AS ELECTRONS
BUILD UP ON YOUR BODY, YOU GET


185
0:9:36,633 --> 0:9:39,967
ONE CHARGE OF ELECTRONS ON YOUR
BODY THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN


186
0:9:39,967 --> 0:9:40,6
SOMEBODY ELSE.


187
0:9:40,6 --> 0:9:45,66
SO THE MORE YOU RUB, THOSE
ELECTRONS TRANSFER TO YOU, AND


188
0:9:45,66 --> 0:9:46,867
CAN'T GET OFF OF YOU.


189
0:9:46,867 --> 0:9:48,8
UNTIL YOU REACH TO TOUCH
SOMETHING.


190
0:9:48,8 --> 0:9:53,8
AND THAT ZAP AGAIN, WHEN YOU
SHOCK SOMEBODY, BECAUSE YOU


191
0:9:53,8 --> 0:9:57,9
BUILT THAT UP, THAT'S A LITTLE
MINI-LIGHTNING BOLT IS WHY IT


192
0:9:57,9 --> 0:9:58,533
HURTS.


193
0:9:58,533 --> 0:10:4,166
>> HI, MY NAME IS KENDALL AND I
WOULD LIKE TO ASK, HOW DOES


194
0:10:4,166 --> 0:10:5,0
TIDAL POWER WORK?


195
0:10:5,0 --> 0:10:8,66
>> THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION.


196
0:10:8,66 --> 0:10:12,233
TIDAL POWER IS SIMILAR TO
HYDROELECTRIC POWER THAT WE'RE


197
0:10:12,233 --> 0:10:13,633
MORE FAMILIAR WITH IN IDAHO.


198
0:10:13,633 --> 0:10:19,0
THE WATER IS HELD UP BY DAMS,
AND IT GETS HIGHER AND HIGHER


199
0:10:19,0 --> 0:10:20,734
ABOVE THE LEVEL OF THE RIVER.


200
0:10:20,734 --> 0:10:24,5
AND WE USE GRAVITY TO MOVE THAT
WATER DOWN TO THE LEVEL OF THE


201
0:10:24,5 --> 0:10:30,7
RIVER AND WHILE IT'S ON ITS WAY
THROUGH IT SPIN AS TURBINE THAT


202
0:10:30,7 --> 0:10:31,9
GENERATES POWER.


203
0:10:31,9 --> 0:10:35,333
TIDAL POWER, SOMETIMES THE TIDES
WILL RISE AND FILL THE WATER


204
0:10:35,333 --> 0:10:39,0
BEHIND A DAM, THEY'LL CLOSE THE
DAM OFF, AND THEN IT LOOKS JUST


205
0:10:39,0 --> 0:10:41,333
LIKE A HYDRODAM.


206
0:10:41,333 --> 0:10:44,333
SOMETIMES IF THE TIDES ARE
COMING IN THROUGH A SMALLER AREA


207
0:10:44,333 --> 0:10:47,8
LIKE A RIVER, LIKE OUTSIDE OF
NEW YORK CITY, FOR EXAMPLE, THE


208
0:10:47,8 --> 0:10:52,433
EAST RIVER, THEY'LL PUT
PROPELLERS UNDER WATER, ANCHORED


209
0:10:52,433 --> 0:10:55,8
TO THE FLOOR OF THE RIVER, AND
THE TIDE WILL MOVE PAST THE


210
0:10:55,8 --> 0:10:56,166
PROPELLERS.


211
0:10:56,166 --> 0:10:59,166
THEY LOOK LIKE LITTLE WIND
TURBINES, JUST LIKE THE ONES WE


212
0:10:59,166 --> 0:11:1,0
SEE OUT THERE, JUST SMALLER.


213
0:11:1,0 --> 0:11:5,533
AND THE FLOWING WATER MOVES THE
PROPELLERS, THE TURBINES, AND


214
0:11:5,533 --> 0:11:7,66
THAT TURNS THE GENERATOR.


215
0:11:7,66 --> 0:11:11,6
BOTH OF THOSE METHODS ARE BEING
USED.


216
0:11:11,6 --> 0:11:16,5
>> RYAN ASKS, WHAT CREATES THE
ELECTRICITY IN SOLAR PANELS AND


217
0:11:16,5 --> 0:11:17,367
LIGHTNING?


218
0:11:17,367 --> 0:11:21,734
>> WELL, RYAN, THE WAY
ELECTRICITY IS CREATED IN SOLAR


219
0:11:21,734 --> 0:11:24,266
PANELS, THEY'RE BASICALLY SAND,
OR SILICON.


220
0:11:24,266 --> 0:11:28,7
F AS THE SUNLIGHT HITS THEM THE
ELECTRONS GET EXCITED, BUT IT'S


221
0:11:28,7 --> 0:11:32,7
A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED THAN
THAT IN THAT THEY HAVE GATES


222
0:11:32,7 --> 0:11:32,967
ALSO.


223
0:11:32,967 --> 0:11:36,433
THAT ONLY LET THE ELECTRONS OUT
IN ONE DIRECTION, AND THAT'S


224
0:11:36,433 --> 0:11:38,533
WHAT CREATES THE CURRENT.


225
0:11:38,533 --> 0:11:42,266
THE ELECTRONS BOUNCE OUT OF THE
SOLAR PANELS.


226
0:11:42,266 --> 0:11:45,633
NOW, LIGHTNING IS A LITTLE
DIFFERENT IN THAT IT'S ACTUALLY


227
0:11:45,633 --> 0:11:46,9
STATIC ELECTRICITY.


228
0:11:46,9 --> 0:11:50,7
SO JUST THINK OF WALKING ACROSS
THE CAR EXPET RUBBING YOUR


229
0:11:50,7 --> 0:11:51,433
SHOES.


230
0:11:51,433 --> 0:11:55,5
AS CLOUDS RUB AGAINST THE EARTH,
OR THE ATMOSPHERE, IF YOU WILL,


231
0:11:55,5 --> 0:11:59,567
CHARGES CAN BE BUILT UP THAT ARE
DIFFERENT BETWEEN THE CLOUD AND


232
0:11:59,567 --> 0:12:0,333
THE EARTH.


233
0:12:0,333 --> 0:12:3,7
AND ONCE THAT GETS STRONG
ENOUGH, THERE'S ENOUGH


234
0:12:3,7 --> 0:12:8,66
DIFFERENCE IN THE ELECTRONS, THE
POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE CHARGES


235
0:12:8,66 --> 0:12:11,967
THAT IT WILL --
WHAT WE CALL IONIZE THE AIR,


236
0:12:11,967 --> 0:12:15,9
THAT'S THAT BIG ZAP THAT ALLOWS
THE ELECTRONS TO GO THROUGH THE


237
0:12:15,9 --> 0:12:20,0
AIR DOWN TO THE GROUND TO
BALANCE OUT THE CHARGES AGAIN.


238
0:12:20,0 --> 0:12:20,266
>> HI.


239
0:12:20,266 --> 0:12:20,967
MY NAME IS CHRIS.


240
0:12:20,967 --> 0:12:25,734
MY QUESTION IS, HOW MUCH
ELECTRICITY CAN TIDAL POWER


241
0:12:25,734 --> 0:12:26,1
PRODUCE?


242
0:12:26,1 --> 0:12:27,367
>> THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION.


243
0:12:27,367 --> 0:12:30,533
THERE'S LOTS OF AREAS IN
RENEWABLE ENERGY WE DON'T KNOW


244
0:12:30,533 --> 0:12:31,333
MUCH ABOUT YET.


245
0:12:31,333 --> 0:12:33,8
AND TIDAL POWER IS ONE OF THEM.


246
0:12:33,8 --> 0:12:37,633
THE MOON'S ORBIT CHANGES THE
LEVEL OF THE OCEANS TWICE A DAY


247
0:12:37,633 --> 0:12:39,867
THROUGHOUT ALL THE COASTAL AREAS
OF THE WORLD.


248
0:12:39,867 --> 0:12:42,9
AND IF THE CONDITIONS ARE RIGHT,
WHERE WE HAVE HIGH TIDE AND THE


249
0:12:42,9 --> 0:12:48,9
RIGHT KINDS OF HARBORS OR
INLETS, WE CAN BUILD DEVICES


250
0:12:48,9 --> 0:12:51,533
THAT CAN HARNESS THAT ENERGY.


251
0:12:51,533 --> 0:12:53,5
WE DON'T --
THE ANSWER IS NOT VERY MUCH.


252
0:12:53,5 --> 0:12:55,533
WE DON'T DO VERY MUCH OF THAT
RIGHT NOW THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY


253
0:12:55,533 --> 0:12:56,633
OR THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.


254
0:12:56,633 --> 0:13:0,233
BUT IT'S AN AREA, AN EXCITING
AREA OF RESEARCH AND A LOT OF


255
0:13:0,233 --> 0:13:6,633
HOPE TO DO THAT IN THE FUTURE.


256
0:13:6,633 --> 0:13:9,867
>> IF YOU TRAVELED AS FAST AS
ELECTRICITY, YOU COULD GO AROUND


257
0:13:9,867 --> 0:13:13,6
THE WORLD EIGHT TIMES IN THE
TIME IT TAKES TO TURN ON A LIGHT


258
0:13:13,6 --> 0:13:19,66
SWITCH.


259
0:13:19,66 --> 0:13:22,533
>> HELLO, MY NAME IS MOSES AND
MY QUESTION IS, WHAT PROPERTIES


260
0:13:22,533 --> 0:13:28,0
OF METAL AND BONE MAKE THEM SUCH
GREAT CONDUCTORS OF ELECTRICITY?


261
0:13:28,0 --> 0:13:31,6
>> MOSES, WHAT MAKES A GOOD
CONDUCTOR IS SOMETHING CALLED


262
0:13:31,6 --> 0:13:32,5
FREE ELECTRONS.


263
0:13:32,5 --> 0:13:37,166
IN OTHER WORDS, IT'S MADE UP OF
ATOMS THAT HAVE A WATT OF --


264
0:13:37,166 --> 0:13:41,333
A LOT OF ELECTRONS THAT CAN MOVE
FROM ATOM TO ATOM WITHOUT A LOT


265
0:13:41,333 --> 0:13:45,333
OF RESISTANCE SO THAT THEY CAN
MOVE EASILY, BUT JUST LIKE A


266
0:13:45,333 --> 0:13:49,0
PIECE OF METAL OR YOUR BONE, IT
DOESN'T MEAN ELECTRONS ARE


267
0:13:49,0 --> 0:13:53,633
MOVING THROUGH THERE CONSTANTLY
RIGHT NOW, IT TAKES A DIFFERENCE


268
0:13:53,633 --> 0:13:55,0
IN VOLTAGE TO MAKE THEM MOVE.


269
0:13:55,0 --> 0:13:58,266
IF YOU CAN PUSH THE ELECTRONS
AND THEY'LL MOVE EASILY, THAT'S


270
0:13:58,266 --> 0:14:0,9
WHAT MAKES A GOOD CONDUCTOR.


271
0:14:0,9 --> 0:14:4,633
SOMETHING THAT'S AN INSULATOR IS
WHERE THE ELECTRONS ARE BOUND


272
0:14:4,633 --> 0:14:6,6
VERY TIGHT TOGETHER AND DON'T
MOVE.


273
0:14:6,6 --> 0:14:9,333
SO EVEN IF YOU PUSH ON THE
ELECTRONS, THEY'RE GOING TO STAY


274
0:14:9,333 --> 0:14:12,433
IN PLACE.


275
0:14:12,433 --> 0:14:17,9
>> WHY DO THEY NEED A?ID
BATTERIES?


276
0:14:17,9 --> 0:14:21,233
>> ELIZABETH, THE REASON THAT
YOU HAVE ACID IN BATTERIES, OR


277
0:14:21,233 --> 0:14:27,8
WHAT ARE CALLED LEAD ACID
BATTERIES, ARE THE ACID CREATES


278
0:14:27,8 --> 0:14:31,533
A FLUID THAT ALLOWS ELECTRONS TO
BE STORED IN IT.


279
0:14:31,533 --> 0:14:34,5
IT'S ACTUALLY AN ICE 0 TAUPE.


280
0:14:34,5 --> 0:14:37,66
--
ISOTOPE.


281
0:14:37,66 --> 0:14:41,734
SO THE ELECTRONS CAN MOVE FREELY
THROUGH THE FLUID, BUT JUST LIKE


282
0:14:41,734 --> 0:14:45,8
THE IMPURITIES IN THE WATER, IF
YOU DIDN'T HAVE THIS ACID IN


283
0:14:45,8 --> 0:14:49,533
THERE, THERE WOULDN'T BE ENOUGH
ELECTRONS OR IONS TO EXCHANGE


284
0:14:49,533 --> 0:14:52,0
WITH THE METAL PLATES IN THE
BATTERY.


285
0:14:52,0 --> 0:14:57,233
SO THE ACID REALLY IS A WAY TO
STORE ELECTRONS UNTIL YOU


286
0:14:57,233 --> 0:15:1,734
COMPLETE THE CIRCUIT AND ALLOW
THE ELECTRONS TO FLOW.


287
0:15:1,734 --> 0:15:5,233
>> MOLLY ASKS, HOW DOES
ELECTRICITY TRAVEL THROUGH


288
0:15:5,233 --> 0:15:6,0
WIRES?


289
0:15:6,0 --> 0:15:7,8
>> WELL, MOLLY, THE WAY
ELECTRICITY TRAVELS THROUGH


290
0:15:7,8 --> 0:15:11,66
WIRES IS MUCH LIKE WATER GOES
THROUGH A GARDEN HOSE.


291
0:15:11,66 --> 0:15:13,266
IF YOU'VE EVER EXPERIENCED THAT.


292
0:15:13,266 --> 0:15:16,0
THE ELECTRONS ARE REALLY THE
ELECTRICITY THAT'S MOVING


293
0:15:16,0 --> 0:15:20,9
THROUGH THE WIRES, AND THEY BUMP
ALONG FROM ATOM TO ATOM IN A


294
0:15:20,9 --> 0:15:21,166
CONDUCTOR.


295
0:15:21,166 --> 0:15:22,8
THE ELECTRONS ARE FREE TO MOVE.


296
0:15:22,8 --> 0:15:25,967
SO THEY PUSH EACH OTHER ALONG
JUST LIKE WATER GOES THROUGH A


297
0:15:25,967 --> 0:15:27,333
GARDEN HOSE.


298
0:15:27,333 --> 0:15:34,367
>> MY NAME IS CANNON, AND MY
QUESTION IS, WHY ARE THERE SO


299
0:15:34,367 --> 0:15:40,1
MANY DIFFERENT ELECTRONS THAN
JUST THE ONE BY ONE INCH PIECE


300
0:15:40,1 --> 0:15:42,166
OF MAGNET?


301
0:15:42,166 --> 0:15:44,0
>> THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION.


302
0:15:44,0 --> 0:15:47,867
IT ACTUALLY IS A HARD ONE TO
UNDERSTAND, BECAUSE ELECTRONS


303
0:15:47,867 --> 0:15:51,967
ARE VERY, VERY SMALL, AND
THEY'RE IN EVERYTHING THAT IS


304
0:15:51,967 --> 0:15:53,5
AROUND US.


305
0:15:53,5 --> 0:15:55,333
EVERYTHING --
EVERY MATTER, EVERYTHING THAT'S


306
0:15:55,333 --> 0:15:59,266
MADE UP OF STUFF IS MADE UP OF
ATOMS, AND ATOMS HAVE THREE


307
0:15:59,266 --> 0:16:2,5
KINDS OF THINGS --
PROTONS, NEUTRONS, AND ELECTRONS


308
0:16:2,5 --> 0:16:4,266
AND A LOT OF ELECTRONS.


309
0:16:4,266 --> 0:16:7,266
SO IF I UNDERSTAND YOUR
QUESTION, WHY ARE THERE SO MANY,


310
0:16:7,266 --> 0:16:8,533
IT'S BECAUSE THEY'RE SO SMALL.


311
0:16:8,533 --> 0:16:11,66
THEY'RE SMALLER THAN ANYBODY CAN
SEE.


312
0:16:11,66 --> 0:16:14,9
EVEN SMALLER THAN OUR BEST
MICROSCOPES CAN SEE.


313
0:16:14,9 --> 0:16:18,633
SO IT'S A LITTLE HARD TO GET
YOUR HEAD AROUND THAT, BUT IT'S


314
0:16:18,633 --> 0:16:23,266
A HUGE NUMBER OF ELECTRONS.


315
0:16:23,266 --> 0:16:25,633
>> ZANDER WOULD LIKE TO KNOW
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN


316
0:16:25,633 --> 0:16:29,734
STATIC AND REGULAR ELECTRICITY?


317
0:16:29,734 --> 0:16:32,266
>> WELL, STATIC ELECTRICITY IS
KIND OF WHAT STATIC MEANS.


318
0:16:32,266 --> 0:16:33,433
IT'S NOT MOVING.


319
0:16:33,433 --> 0:16:37,533
SO IT'S JUST A DIFFERENCE IN
WHAT WE CALL POTENTIAL, OR WHICH


320
0:16:37,533 --> 0:16:42,66
IS VOLTAGE, SO STATIC
ELECTRICITY DOESN'T HAVE ANY


321
0:16:42,66 --> 0:16:44,7
CURRENT OR NO ELECTRONS ARE
MOVING.


322
0:16:44,7 --> 0:16:47,967
SO NORMAL ELECTRICITY IS WHEN
THE ELECTRONS ARE MOVING, AND


323
0:16:47,967 --> 0:16:52,66
IT'S THE MOVING OF THOSE
ELECTRONS THAT DO --


324
0:16:52,66 --> 0:16:54,433
DOES WORK, OR IS USABLE.


325
0:16:54,433 --> 0:16:57,266
SO STATIC ELECTRICITY IS KIND OF
LIKE A BATTERY.


326
0:16:57,266 --> 0:17:0,533
IT'S THERE, IT'S READY, BUT IT'S
NOT DOING ANYTHING AT THE


327
0:17:0,533 --> 0:17:1,7
MOMENT.


328
0:17:1,7 --> 0:17:3,66
>> HI, MY NAME IS CLAY.


329
0:17:3,66 --> 0:17:7,6
MY QUESTION IS, HOW LONG UNTIL
THE WORLD RUNS OUT OF FOSSIL


330
0:17:7,6 --> 0:17:11,9
FUEL TO BURN TO MAKE
ELECTRICITY?


331
0:17:11,9 --> 0:17:13,9
>> CLAY, THAT'S A GREAT
QUESTION.


332
0:17:13,9 --> 0:17:15,66
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE ASKING
THAT QUESTION.


333
0:17:15,66 --> 0:17:19,367
THAT'S A QUESTION THAT WE'RE
ASKING OURSELVES AND WORLD


334
0:17:19,367 --> 0:17:22,266
LEADERS ALL AROUND THE WORLD ARE
ASKING ALL THE TIME.


335
0:17:22,266 --> 0:17:25,367
UNFORTUNATELY THE ANSWER IS WE
DON'T REALLY KNOW, BECAUSE


336
0:17:25,367 --> 0:17:27,8
FOSSIL FUELS ARE BURIED DEEP
UNDER THE CRUST.


337
0:17:27,8 --> 0:17:31,66
WE KNOW WHERE WE HAVE FOUND THEM
IN THE PAST, WE KNOW WHERE


338
0:17:31,66 --> 0:17:33,266
THEY'RE EASY TO GET BUT WE'RE
FINDING MORE.


339
0:17:33,266 --> 0:17:37,333
BUT I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT
ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION IS THAT


340
0:17:37,333 --> 0:17:39,0
THEY WILL EVENTUALLY RUN OUT.


341
0:17:39,0 --> 0:17:44,0
AND FINDING OUT WHAT TO DO TO
MAKE ELECTRICITY TO POWER OUR


342
0:17:44,0 --> 0:17:46,967
SOCIETY ONCE THAT RUNS OUT IS
PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT


343
0:17:46,967 --> 0:17:49,967
QUESTION OF WHAT IS LIKELY TO BE
YOUR GENERATION.


344
0:17:49,967 --> 0:17:53,0
AND I THINK KEEPING ASKING THAT
QUESTION IS THE BEST THING WE


345
0:17:53,0 --> 0:17:56,0
CAN DO.


346
0:17:56,0 --> 0:17:59,2
>> AUDREY'S QUESTION IS, WHY
SHOULDN'T YOU PUT RUGS OVER


347
0:17:59,2 --> 0:18:0,433
POWER CORDS?


348
0:18:0,433 --> 0:18:2,533
>> THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT
QUESTION.


349
0:18:2,533 --> 0:18:4,0
IT'S REALLY ABOUT SAFETY.


350
0:18:4,0 --> 0:18:8,433
IF YOU PUT RUGS OVER POWER CORDS
AND WALK ON THEM, JUST WALKING


351
0:18:8,433 --> 0:18:14,9
ON THEM CAN BEBD THEM AND BREAK
THE WIRES OR POSSIBLY DAMAGE THE


352
0:18:14,9 --> 0:18:18,0
INSULATION THAT IS AROUND THE
WIRE THAT KEEPS THE ELECTRICITY


353
0:18:18,0 --> 0:18:19,433
IN THE WIRE.


354
0:18:19,433 --> 0:18:24,867
SO THAT COULD START A FIRE IF
THE ELECTRICITY COULD GET OUT,


355
0:18:24,867 --> 0:18:27,967
OR SP IN THE BEST CASE, IF YOU
BREAK THE WIRE BY WALKING ON IT,


356
0:18:27,967 --> 0:18:31,9
THEN THE CORD WON'T WORK
ANYMORE.


357
0:18:31,9 --> 0:18:34,9
>> FROM CAMERON, IS IT POSSIBLE
TO HAVE TOO MUCH ELECTRICITY


358
0:18:34,9 --> 0:18:38,867
WHEN YOU CHARGE AN ELECTRONICS
DEVICE?


359
0:18:38,867 --> 0:18:41,9
>> CAMERON, HAVING TOO MUCH
ELECTRICITY CAN BE AS BAD OR


360
0:18:41,9 --> 0:18:44,367
EVEN WORSE THAN NOT HAVING
ENOUGH.


361
0:18:44,367 --> 0:18:47,7
SO WHEN YOU'RE CHARGING AN
ELECTRONIC DEVICE, THE REASON


362
0:18:47,7 --> 0:18:52,333
YOU'RE CHARGING IT IS THE
DEVICE'S VOLTAGE IS LOWER THAN


363
0:18:52,333 --> 0:18:55,166
IT NEEDS TO BE AND IT DOES
HAVEN'T ENOUGH ELECTRONS STORED


364
0:18:55,166 --> 0:18:55,8
IN IT.


365
0:18:55,8 --> 0:18:58,367
AS YOU'RE CHARGING IT YOU'RE
MOVING ELECTRONS INTO IT.


366
0:18:58,367 --> 0:19:1,6
BUT AS YOU DO THAT, THE VOLTAGE
IN THE DEVICE COMES UP.


367
0:19:1,6 --> 0:19:6,734
SO IT WILL START TO COUNTER
BALANCE AND THEN THE ELECTRONS


368
0:19:6,734 --> 0:19:8,367
WILL QUIT MOVING BACK AND FORTH.


369
0:19:8,367 --> 0:19:10,5
AND SO THAT'S WHEN IT'S CHARGED.


370
0:19:10,5 --> 0:19:14,533
THE IMPORTANT THING HERE IS TO
PLUG IT INTO THE RIGHT VOLTAGE.


371
0:19:14,533 --> 0:19:20,7
IF I PLUG IN SOMETHING THAT
REQUIRES 12 VOLTS LIKE A CAR TO


372
0:19:20,7 --> 0:19:24,633
SOMETHING THAT'S SUPPLYING 100
VOLTS, THAT'S GOING TO BE TOO


373
0:19:24,633 --> 0:19:30,66
MUCH ELECTRICITY TO CHARGE THE
DEVICE.


374
0:19:30,66 --> 0:19:33,9
>> CADEN ASKS, HOW DOES A
BATTERY STORE ELECTRICITY?


375
0:19:33,9 --> 0:19:36,9
>> A BATTERY STORES ELECTRICITY
THROUGH A CERTAIN KIND OF


376
0:19:36,9 --> 0:19:37,633
CHEMICAL REACTION.


377
0:19:37,633 --> 0:19:40,333
DIFFERENT BATTERIES HAVE
DIFFERENT KIND OF CHEMISTRY, BUT


378
0:19:40,333 --> 0:19:44,533
THERE'S TWO DIFFERENT CHEMICALS
THAT WHEN THEY REACT TOGETHER,


379
0:19:44,533 --> 0:19:49,433
WHEN THEY'RE PUT IN CLOSE
CONTACT, WILL PUSH ELECTRONS


380
0:19:49,433 --> 0:19:55,166
AWAY AND MAKE THEM AVAILABLE TO
TURN ON YOUR FLASHLIGHT OR RUN


381
0:19:55,166 --> 0:19:57,66
YOUR CELL PHONE.


382
0:19:57,66 --> 0:19:59,0
THE SAME THING HAPPENS IN
REVERSE.


383
0:19:59,0 --> 0:20:1,7
IF YOU PUT ELECTRICITY INTO A
BATTERY IT REVERSES THAT


384
0:20:1,7 --> 0:20:5,533
REACTION AND TURNS IT BACK INTO
THOSE OTHER TWO CHEMICALS.


385
0:20:5,533 --> 0:20:8,533
SO IT'S A GREAT WAY TO STORE
ENERGY, AND THEY'RE STORING IT


386
0:20:8,533 --> 0:20:12,5
IN A WAY OF CHEMISTRY AS OPPOSED
TO ELECTRICITY.


387
0:20:12,5 --> 0:20:15,266
>> ABBY WOULD LIKE TO KNOW, WHEN
YOU PUT JUMPER CABLES ON A CAR,


388
0:20:15,266 --> 0:20:16,633
CAN THE CAR RUN AGAIN?


389
0:20:16,633 --> 0:20:19,8
HOW DOES THAT WORK?


390
0:20:19,8 --> 0:20:20,266
>> THAT HAPPENS.


391
0:20:20,266 --> 0:20:23,367
THE REASON YOU USE JUMPER CABLES
IS BECAUSE THE BATTERY IN YOUR


392
0:20:23,367 --> 0:20:27,1
CAR THAT YOU USE TO START THE
CAR, HAS DIED ORS HAS RUN DOWN,


393
0:20:27,1 --> 0:20:30,433
MAYBE YOU LEFT THE LIGHTS ON, OR
IT GOT COLD AND THE CHEMISTRY


394
0:20:30,433 --> 0:20:32,867
GOT AFFECTED OR THE BALTIMOREERY
IS JUST OLD.


395
0:20:32,867 --> 0:20:35,6
SO WHEN YOU --
TO GET THE CAR STARTED YOU NEED


396
0:20:35,6 --> 0:20:38,1
THAT ELECTRICITY STORED IN THE
BATTERY TO TURN THE STARTER


397
0:20:38,1 --> 0:20:40,266
MOTOR THAT TURNS THE ENGINE AND
GETS IT GOING.


398
0:20:40,266 --> 0:20:43,7
SO WHEN THE BATTERY IS DEAD, YOU
CAN'T TURN THE STARTER MOTOR.


399
0:20:43,7 --> 0:20:47,8
SO JUMPER CABLES LET YOU HOOK UP
YOUR BATTERY TO SOMEBODY ELSE'S


400
0:20:47,8 --> 0:20:50,433
BATTERY, YOU'RE USING THE OTHER
BATTERY TO START YOUR CAR.


401
0:20:50,433 --> 0:20:52,633
AND THE RECHARGE YOUR BATTERY A
LITTLE BIT.


402
0:20:52,633 --> 0:20:56,0
BUT ONCE YOUR CAR HAS STARTED
IT'S GOT A GENERATOR THAT WILL


403
0:20:56,0 --> 0:20:56,9
RECHARGE THE BATTERY.


404
0:20:56,9 --> 0:20:59,8
IF ALL YOU DID WAS LEAVE THE
LIGHTS ON THE BATTERY WILL


405
0:20:59,8 --> 0:21:0,967
RECHARGE AND YOU'LL BE FINE.


406
0:21:0,967 --> 0:21:3,1
AND IT SHOULD WORK AGAIN FOR A
WHILE.


407
0:21:3,1 --> 0:21:6,166
IF THE REASON YOU M TO USED
JURNER CABLES IS BECAUSE YOUR


408
0:21:6,166 --> 0:21:8,9
BATTERY WAS OLD, YOU PROBABLY
WILL HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM AGAIN


409
0:21:8,9 --> 0:21:12,433
NEXT WEEK OR TOMORROW AND SO YOU
NEED A NEW BATTERY.


410
0:21:12,433 --> 0:21:12,8
>> HELLO.


411
0:21:12,8 --> 0:21:16,367
MY NAME IS 0 EXPWREN MY QUESTION
IS, WHAT IS THE MOST EFFICIENT


412
0:21:16,367 --> 0:21:18,867
ELECTRICITY GENERATOR?


413
0:21:18,867 --> 0:21:20,867
>> OWEN, THERE ARE LOTS OF
DIFFERENT WAYS TO THINK OF


414
0:21:20,867 --> 0:21:24,266
WHAT'S THE MOST EFFICIENT
ELECTRICITY GENERATOR, BECAUSE


415
0:21:24,266 --> 0:21:29,333
THE GENERATOR ITSELF IS JUST A
WAY TO CONVERT ONE FORM OF


416
0:21:29,333 --> 0:21:31,433
ENERGY INTO ELECTRICITY.


417
0:21:31,433 --> 0:21:35,433
SO YOU CAN CONVERT IT --
CONVERTING WIND INTO ELECTRICITY


418
0:21:35,433 --> 0:21:40,333
IS TAKING PHYSICAL FORCE FROM
THE WIND AND TURNING SOMETHING


419
0:21:40,333 --> 0:21:45,967
THAT THEN GENERATES ELECTRICITY,
WHEREAS THE FALLING WATER,


420
0:21:45,967 --> 0:21:48,0
BURNING FOSSIL FUELS IS ANOTHER
CONVERSION.


421
0:21:48,0 --> 0:21:53,0
SO WHEN I USE HEAT TO CREATE
STEAM TO TURN SOMETHING, THAT'S


422
0:21:53,0 --> 0:21:57,7
MUCH LESS EFFICIENT THAN JUST
TURNING IT WITH OTHER MECHANICAL


423
0:21:57,7 --> 0:21:58,266
FORCES.


424
0:21:58,266 --> 0:22:3,166
SO THE EFFICIENCY AS WE TRY TO
MEASURE IT, IS THE TOTAL ENERGY


425
0:22:3,166 --> 0:22:6,166
IN VERSUS THE AMOUNT OF
ELECTRICITY OUT.


426
0:22:6,166 --> 0:22:12,0
AND THE MOST EFFICIENT ONE THEN
IS THAT LOSES THE LEAST AMOUNT


427
0:22:12,0 --> 0:22:16,266
OF ENERGY CONVERTING IT TO
ELECTRICITY.


428
0:22:16,266 --> 0:22:20,66
>> IF YOU GET SHOCKED, WHAT
HAPPENS TO YOUR BRAIN?


429
0:22:20,66 --> 0:22:21,1
>> THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION.


430
0:22:21,1 --> 0:22:23,8
OF COURSE THE IMPORTANT THING IS
TO NOT GET SHOCKED, BECAUSE


431
0:22:23,8 --> 0:22:26,7
ELECTRICITY CAN BE VERY
DANGEROUS.


432
0:22:26,7 --> 0:22:28,9
AND IT DEPENDS WHETHER THE
ELECTRICITY TRAVELS THROUGH YOUR


433
0:22:28,9 --> 0:22:29,8
BRAIN OR NOT.


434
0:22:29,8 --> 0:22:32,9
USUALLY MOST PEOPLE GET SHOCKED,
IT TRAVELS THROUGH YOUR ARMS OR


435
0:22:32,9 --> 0:22:36,0
LEGS AND IT CAN DISRUPT THE WAY
YOUR HEARTBEATS OR IT COULD


436
0:22:36,0 --> 0:22:39,533
CAUSE BURNS ON YOUR FINGERS OR
OTHER PLACES WHERE THE


437
0:22:39,533 --> 0:22:42,633
ELECTRICITY ENTERS AND LEAVES
YOUR BOY BODY.


438
0:22:42,633 --> 0:22:46,233
YOUR BRAIN HAS A LOT OF
ELECTRICITY IN IT, THAT'S WHAT


439
0:22:46,233 --> 0:22:49,333
HELPS YOU THINK, SO IT CAN
SCRAMBLE THAT A LOT.


440
0:22:49,333 --> 0:22:54,533
EVEN SMALL AMOUNT CAN MAKE YOU
UNCONSCIOUS OR CAUSE A LOT OF


441
0:22:54,533 --> 0:22:55,233
PAIN.


442
0:22:55,233 --> 0:23:1,7
>> HIGH NAME IS IRIS, AND MY
QUESTION IS, DOES HAIL AFFECT


443
0:23:1,7 --> 0:23:4,734
POWER LINES WHEN IT'S HAILING?


444
0:23:4,734 --> 0:23:8,533
>> IRIS, THE WAY HAIL CAN AFFECT
OR ANYTHING FALLING OUT OF THE


445
0:23:8,533 --> 0:23:12,433
SKY, WHETHER IT'S FROZEN WATER
IN TERMS OF ICE OR HAIL, OR EVEN


446
0:23:12,433 --> 0:23:17,266
THE WIND THAT MIGHT COME WITH
THE STORM, IS THE POWER LINES


447
0:23:17,266 --> 0:23:20,1
ARE SUSPENDED ON TOWERS.


448
0:23:20,1 --> 0:23:22,9
AND IF ENOUGH THINGS HIT THEM
WITH ENOUGH FORCE, THEY COULD BE


449
0:23:22,9 --> 0:23:25,734
DAMAGED OR BROKEN, OR THE
INSULATORS COULD BE.


450
0:23:25,734 --> 0:23:29,333
SO IF A POWER LINE FALLS ON THE
GROUND, YOU WANT TO STAY AWAY


451
0:23:29,333 --> 0:23:33,166
FROM IT BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW
IF IT STILL HAS ELECTRICITY OR


452
0:23:33,166 --> 0:23:33,433
NOT.


453
0:23:33,433 --> 0:23:37,0
BUT THAT'S ONE WAY THAT STORMS
OR THE WEATHER CAN KNOCK DOWN A


454
0:23:37,0 --> 0:23:39,9
POWER LINE.


455
0:23:39,9 --> 0:23:43,7
>> McKENZIE ASKS, CAN WE EVER
RUN OUT OF ELECTRICITY?


456
0:23:43,7 --> 0:23:45,633
>> ANOTHER GREAT QUESTION.


457
0:23:45,633 --> 0:23:48,367
I THINK THE BETTER WAY TO ANSWER
THAT IS TO THINK ABOUT WHERE


458
0:23:48,367 --> 0:23:49,7
ELECTRICITY COMES FROM.


459
0:23:49,7 --> 0:23:52,633
SO THERE WILL BE THINGS WE MAKE
ELECTRICITY FROM, LIKE SOLAR


460
0:23:52,633 --> 0:23:57,633
ENERGY, OR WIND OR HYDRO, THAT
IS BY DEFINITION RENEWABLE.


461
0:23:57,633 --> 0:23:59,2
IT KEEPS COMING BACK.


462
0:23:59,2 --> 0:24:3,433
SO WE GET SNOWPACK IN OUR
MOUNTAINS TO FILL OUR


463
0:24:3,433 --> 0:24:4,967
RESERVOIRS, AND THAT WILL BE
AVAILABLE TO MAKE ELECTRICITY


464
0:24:4,967 --> 0:24:7,166
NEXT YEAR AND THE YEAR AFTER
THAT AND YEAR AFTER THAT.


465
0:24:7,166 --> 0:24:10,166
AS LONG AS WE'VE GOT WATER ON
THE PLANET AND IT RAINS, WE'LL


466
0:24:10,166 --> 0:24:12,734
BE ABLE TO MAKE
HYDROELECTRICITY.


467
0:24:12,734 --> 0:24:15,233
AS LONG AS THE SUNSHINES WE'LL
BE ABLE TO MAKE ELECTRICITY FROM


468
0:24:15,233 --> 0:24:15,633
THE SUN.


469
0:24:15,633 --> 0:24:18,9
WHAT WE WILL RUN OUT OF ARE THE
FOSSIL FUELS THAT WE DEPEND ON


470
0:24:18,9 --> 0:24:21,967
FOR ABOUT HALF OF THE
ELECTRICITY, TWO-THIRDS OF THE


471
0:24:21,967 --> 0:24:23,367
ELECTRICITY WE USE IN THIS
COUNTRY.


472
0:24:23,367 --> 0:24:26,7
AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING
THAT WE NEED TO BE ADDRESSING,


473
0:24:26,7 --> 0:24:27,333
AND WE ARE.


474
0:24:27,333 --> 0:24:31,867
WE'RE DOING A LOT OF RESEARCH IN
HOW TO MAKE THE RENEWABLE


475
0:24:31,867 --> 0:24:35,266
ENERGIES MORE RELIABLE AND LESS
EXPENSIVE.


476
0:24:35,266 --> 0:24:38,1
>> WHY DID YOU BOTH DECIDE THAT
YOU WANTED TO GET A JOB DEALING


477
0:24:38,1 --> 0:24:38,7
WITH ELECTRICITY?


478
0:24:38,7 --> 0:24:42,7
WHAT WAS IT MA THA MADE YOU WANT TO
DO THIS FOR A LIVING?


479
0:24:42,7 --> 0:24:43,233
JOHN?


480
0:24:43,233 --> 0:24:45,266
>> WELL, I'M A PROFESSOR OF
MECHANICAL ENGINEERING.


481
0:24:45,266 --> 0:24:48,266
AND SO THAT'S NOT SOMETHING YOU
OFTEN ASSOCIATE WITH


482
0:24:48,266 --> 0:24:50,333
ELECTRICITY, BUT I'M VERY
INTERESTED IN ENERGY AND HOW


483
0:24:50,333 --> 0:24:53,7
SOCIETY USES IT AND HOW WE USE
IT AS A SOCIETY.


484
0:24:53,7 --> 0:24:57,166
SO WHEN YOU START GOING DOWN
THAT ROAD YOU IMMEDIATELY GET TO


485
0:24:57,166 --> 0:24:57,867
ELECTRICITY.


486
0:24:57,867 --> 0:25:1,533
BECAUSE THAT'S PREDOMINANT, THE
MOST VALUABLE, THE MOST FLEXIBLE


487
0:25:1,533 --> 0:25:3,66
USE OF ENERGY WE HAVE.


488
0:25:3,66 --> 0:25:7,867
SO OVER THE LAST 10 YEARS OR SO
MY CAREER HAS SPENT TIME WORKING


489
0:25:7,867 --> 0:25:10,233
IN THE AREA OF ELECTRICITY.


490
0:25:10,233 --> 0:25:13,233
>> FOR ME GETTING INTO
ELECTRICITY WAS KIND OF A


491
0:25:13,233 --> 0:25:16,66
NO-BRAINER IN THAT MY FATHER
WORKED FOR THE ELECTRIC UTILITY


492
0:25:16,66 --> 0:25:17,0
AS WELL.


493
0:25:17,0 --> 0:25:20,867
BUT WHAT REALLY INTERESTED ME IN
ELECTRICITY IS MATH.


494
0:25:20,867 --> 0:25:24,266
BECAUSE I LOVE MATH SO MUCH,
ELECTRICITY, YOU CAN'T SEE.


495
0:25:24,266 --> 0:25:27,8
SO THE WAY WE UNDERSTAND
ELECTRICITY IS THROUGH USING


496
0:25:27,8 --> 0:25:32,8
MATH, AND EQUATIONS, AND THAT
ALLOWS US TO THEN SIMULATE OR


497
0:25:32,8 --> 0:25:36,9
RUN COMPUTER MODELS OR THINK
ABOUT HOW IT WORKS AND JUST


498
0:25:36,9 --> 0:25:40,166
DISCOVER HOW TO USE MATH FOR
SOMETHING THAT NO ONE CAN SEE.


499
0:25:40,166 --> 0:25:43,333
AND BESIDES, IF YOU CAN'T SEE
IT, NO ONE CAN PROVE YOU WERE


500
0:25:43,333 --> 0:25:45,166
WRONG, CAN THEY?


501
0:25:45,166 --> 0:25:48,1
>> THE FOLLOW-UP TO THAT IS
ALWAYS, IF SOMEONE WANTS TO DO


502
0:25:48,1 --> 0:25:51,533
THAT FOR A LIVING, WHAT SHOULD
THEY STUDY IN SCHOOL?


503
0:25:51,533 --> 0:25:55,533
>> DEFINITELY TO GET INVOLVED IN
ANY ENGINEERING FIELD, BUT IN


504
0:25:55,533 --> 0:25:59,1
ELECTRICITY OR ENERGY,
UNDERSTANDING MATH IS VERY, VERY


505
0:25:59,1 --> 0:25:59,433
IMPORTANT.


506
0:25:59,433 --> 0:26:1,266
BUT ALSO THE SCIENCES.


507
0:26:1,266 --> 0:26:4,367
NOW, IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO
RECOGNIZE IT'S NOT JUST PHYSICAL


508
0:26:4,367 --> 0:26:7,734
SCIENCES THAT WOULD BE PHYSICS
AND CHEMISTRY, THOSE ARE VERY,


509
0:26:7,734 --> 0:26:8,967
VERY IMPORTANT.


510
0:26:8,967 --> 0:26:14,7
BUT ELECTRICITY IS ALSO A VERY
USEFUL IN BIOMEDICAL AS WELL AS


511
0:26:14,7 --> 0:26:17,867
BIOLOGY, BECAUSE OUR BODIES RUN
ON ELECTRICITY AS WELL.


512
0:26:17,867 --> 0:26:24,967
SO UNDERSTANDING ELECTRICITY IS
PART OF UNDERSTANDING YOURSELF.


513
0:26:24,967 --> 0:26:26,0
>> THAT'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.


514
0:26:26,0 --> 0:26:29,533
I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT NOT
JUST TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE


515
0:26:29,533 --> 0:26:33,66
IN YOUR MATH COURSE AND DO WELL
IN MATH, BUT ALSO TO BE CURIOUS.


516
0:26:33,66 --> 0:26:35,367
AND THE KIND OF QUESTIONS WE
TALKED ABOUT TODAY ARE EXACTLY


517
0:26:35,367 --> 0:26:36,734
THE RIGHT KIND OF QUESTIONS.


518
0:26:36,734 --> 0:26:39,333
IF YOU'RE WONDERING ABOUT HOW
ELECTRICITY WORKS, KEEP ASKING


519
0:26:39,333 --> 0:26:42,867
THOSE QUESTIONS AND LOOK FOR
THOSE ANSWERS.


520
0:26:42,867 --> 0:26:45,333
>> I'M SORRY, WE'VE RUN OUT OF
TIME.


521
