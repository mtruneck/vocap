2
0:0:0,22 --> 0:0:1,97
STEVE SPANGLER: Well, this might
look like just a giant


3
0:0:1,97 --> 0:0:3,38
pile of silly putty.


4
0:0:3,38 --> 0:0:3,96
It's not.


5
0:0:3,96 --> 0:0:8,22
It's actually homemade gak using
glue and water and a


6
0:0:8,22 --> 0:0:9,4
little bit of Borax.


7
0:0:9,4 --> 0:0:11,9
Believe it or not, this gak--


8
0:0:11,9 --> 0:0:12,32
gooey material--


9
0:0:12,32 --> 0:0:16,93
can be used to learn something
about the science of glaciers.


10
0:0:16,93 --> 0:0:20,115
I'm Steve Spangler, and I'm all
about making science fun.


11
0:0:20,115 --> 0:0:23,13
For the last 20 years, I've
been teaching ways to turn


12
0:0:23,13 --> 0:0:26,1
ordinary science experiments
into unforgettable


13
0:0:26,1 --> 0:0:27,16
experiences.


14
0:0:27,16 --> 0:0:29,8
I have an amazing team who will
do whatever it takes to


15
0:0:29,8 --> 0:0:32,29
affect the way people
think about science.


16
0:0:32,29 --> 0:0:34,84
And to do that, I live
by one motto--


17
0:0:34,84 --> 0:0:37,85
make it big, do it right,
give it class.


18
0:0:37,85 --> 0:0:42,88



19
0:0:42,88 --> 0:0:44,36
So how do you make the stuff?


20
0:0:44,36 --> 0:0:47,19
It's very, very simple, but
there's a change the normal


21
0:0:47,19 --> 0:0:49,21
recipe that you may
have found online.


22
0:0:49,21 --> 0:0:51,13
And so these are the materials
you're going to need-- a


23
0:0:51,13 --> 0:0:52,6
little bit of glue--


24
0:0:52,6 --> 0:0:53,6
OK, a lot of glue--


25
0:0:53,6 --> 0:0:57,3
some water, and some
Mule Team Borax.


26
0:0:57,3 --> 0:0:59,85
A box of this will last you a
life, but this is the secret


27
0:0:59,85 --> 0:1:3,1
to making all the slimes and
gaks and ooze and all those


28
0:1:3,1 --> 0:1:3,53
other things.


29
0:1:3,53 --> 0:1:4,89
It's the cross linker.


30
0:1:4,89 --> 0:1:6,79
We'll talk about the chemistry
here in just a second.


31
0:1:6,79 --> 0:1:8,22
First, the glue.


32
0:1:8,22 --> 0:1:10,34
I would suggest using
Elmer's Glue.


33
0:1:10,34 --> 0:1:12,66
Don't use school glue
or anything else.


34
0:1:12,66 --> 0:1:16,5
Elmer's Glue is actually
polyvinyl acetate, and


35
0:1:16,5 --> 0:1:20,82
polyvinyl acetate has the same
behavior as polyvinyl alcohol,


36
0:1:20,82 --> 0:1:22,405
which is the main ingredient
for slime.


37
0:1:22,405 --> 0:1:24,22
So that's why it
works so well.


38
0:1:24,22 --> 0:1:26,55
You think of this-- it's
just like spaghetti.


39
0:1:26,55 --> 0:1:29,32
You cook spaghetti, and
in the pot, those


40
0:1:29,32 --> 0:1:30,62
noodles move around.


41
0:1:30,62 --> 0:1:32,3
The pasta moves back
and forth.


42
0:1:32,3 --> 0:1:35,35
Even when you drain the water,
it still slips and slides all


43
0:1:35,35 --> 0:1:35,93
over each other.


44
0:1:35,93 --> 0:1:37,53
That's exactly what
glue is like.


45
0:1:37,53 --> 0:1:40,94
Once glue dehydrates, though,
and all the water's gone,


46
0:1:40,94 --> 0:1:44,38
those molecules now stick into
place wherever they were.


47
0:1:44,38 --> 0:1:45,68
And so that's how glue works.


48
0:1:45,68 --> 0:1:47,97
What we want to do is to
keep all the moisture.


49
0:1:47,97 --> 0:1:51,19
In fact, we want to add some
moisture and hook the


50
0:1:51,19 --> 0:1:52,48
molecules together
at the same time.


51
0:1:52,48 --> 0:1:55,826



52
0:1:55,826 --> 0:1:58,12
All right, I'm adding water.


53
0:1:58,12 --> 0:2:0,8
It's hard to tell you
exactly how much.


54
0:2:0,8 --> 0:2:4,17
You just want this really,
really soupy mess in here.


55
0:2:4,17 --> 0:2:6,76
And there's no substitute to
getting your fingers in there


56
0:2:6,76 --> 0:2:8,19
and feeling it.


57
0:2:8,19 --> 0:2:10,729
It is going to feel
very, very runny.


58
0:2:10,729 --> 0:2:13,95
And you know that that's the
perfect consistency.


59
0:2:13,95 --> 0:2:17,35
It's still thick and viscous,
but not nearly


60
0:2:17,35 --> 0:2:18,82
as thick as it was.


61
0:2:18,82 --> 0:2:19,79
This is pretty good.


62
0:2:19,79 --> 0:2:22,3
There's no going back and adding
more water later on, so


63
0:2:22,3 --> 0:2:24,64
you're going to want to
experiment with a small batch


64
0:2:24,64 --> 0:2:26,48
before you make a large
one to know exactly


65
0:2:26,48 --> 0:2:28,46
how it should feel.


66
0:2:28,46 --> 0:2:31,66
Technically speaking, Borax
is sodium tetraborate.


67
0:2:31,66 --> 0:2:34,24
It's the perfect cross linker
that we need to hook those


68
0:2:34,24 --> 0:2:35,53
molecules together.


69
0:2:35,53 --> 0:2:37,63
It's very simple to make
a solution with water.


70
0:2:37,63 --> 0:2:41,54
You just need to make a
saturated solution.


71
0:2:41,54 --> 0:2:45,61
So a saturated solution is a
solution when you stir it up


72
0:2:45,61 --> 0:2:49,32
and let it sit for a second
that there's still a small


73
0:2:49,32 --> 0:2:50,93
amount remaining on
the very bottom.


74
0:2:50,93 --> 0:2:53,43
It's when that last teaspoon
doesn't dissolve.


75
0:2:53,43 --> 0:2:55,13
That's a saturated solution.


76
0:2:55,13 --> 0:2:57,76
That's a perfect Borax
solution to hook


77
0:2:57,76 --> 0:2:59,405
our molecules together.


78
0:2:59,405 --> 0:3:3,28
It's when I pour in the Borax
solution like this that you


79
0:3:3,28 --> 0:3:5,78
start to see the stringiness.


80
0:3:5,78 --> 0:3:8,11
Again, there's no substitute
for getting in there and


81
0:3:8,11 --> 0:3:9,55
really mixing it around.


82
0:3:9,55 --> 0:3:12,4
You may have to make up some
more Borax solution.


83
0:3:12,4 --> 0:3:13,87
Again, it's totally by feel.


84
0:3:13,87 --> 0:3:15,74
Every batch is a little
bit different.


85
0:3:15,74 --> 0:3:20,1
While you can use a standard
recipe, it's best to just use


86
0:3:20,1 --> 0:3:22,78
your hand and make
it by touch.


87
0:3:22,78 --> 0:3:26,62
I can tell that it's starting
to work out, but we need


88
0:3:26,62 --> 0:3:29,86
definitely a little bit more
water, a little bit more Borax


89
0:3:29,86 --> 0:3:32,14
to hook this last little
piece together.


90
0:3:32,14 --> 0:3:35,82
We want this gooey, slimy
consistency, but we don't want


91
0:3:35,82 --> 0:3:37,89
to sticking to the sides.


92
0:3:37,89 --> 0:3:37,99
All


93
0:3:37,99 --> 0:3:38,18
Right.


94
0:3:38,18 --> 0:3:41,54
This is just about the
perfect consistency.


95
0:3:41,54 --> 0:3:44,83
This is what you want, for
one piece of it, anyway.


96
0:3:44,83 --> 0:3:47,13
So you can see the movement
of this, because it


97
0:3:47,13 --> 0:3:48,6
is this great material.


98
0:3:48,6 --> 0:3:51,52
Make the same batch again, but
this time add some food


99
0:3:51,52 --> 0:3:52,52
coloring to it.


100
0:3:52,52 --> 0:3:55,33
I like to make it blue.


101
0:3:55,33 --> 0:4:0,3
This is a non-Newtonian fluid,
meaning that it doesn't obey


102
0:4:0,3 --> 0:4:1,58
the laws that Newton--


103
0:4:1,58 --> 0:4:3,51
Isaac Newton-- set
out to describe--


104
0:4:3,51 --> 0:4:6,13
something that goes from a
liquid to a solid or from a


105
0:4:6,13 --> 0:4:7,23
solid to a liquid.


106
0:4:7,23 --> 0:4:10,89
You can see that this flowing
liquid here actually has


107
0:4:10,89 --> 0:4:14,11
solid-like properties when
you add pressure to it.


108
0:4:14,11 --> 0:4:15,29
Watch.


109
0:4:15,29 --> 0:4:16,399
See how it breaks off?


110
0:4:16,399 --> 0:4:20,23
It literally shears off an edge,
very similar to what a


111
0:4:20,23 --> 0:4:22,34
glacier does when that
pressure is there.


112
0:4:22,34 --> 0:4:24,19
You have literally a liquid--


113
0:4:24,19 --> 0:4:27,3
the constant movement shearing
off into a solid.


114
0:4:27,3 --> 0:4:30,72
Yet if you allow it to work its
way back together again,


115
0:4:30,72 --> 0:4:34,62
it becomes and flows
just like a liquid.


116
0:4:34,62 --> 0:4:38,77
It's perfect to explain the
properties of a glacier.


117
0:4:38,77 --> 0:4:40,46
Now you can see why we want
a different color.


118
0:4:40,46 --> 0:4:43,23
Blue and the white is
perfect, because now


119
0:4:43,23 --> 0:4:45,58
we can see the movement.


120
0:4:45,58 --> 0:4:47,96
If you were actually in Alaska
and you could see the ice, you


121
0:4:47,96 --> 0:4:49,42
would see blue ice.


122
0:4:49,42 --> 0:4:51,79
It's just this water that has
this tremendous amount of


123
0:4:51,79 --> 0:4:52,79
pressure on it.


124
0:4:52,79 --> 0:4:55,42
And as those molecules get
packed together, it's


125
0:4:55,42 --> 0:4:58,53
literally more dense than
regular water, and the light


126
0:4:58,53 --> 0:5:0,54
refracts through there
differently than it normally


127
0:5:0,54 --> 0:5:3,98
would through just regular water
that we would normally


128
0:5:3,98 --> 0:5:5,5
see in a glass.


129
0:5:5,5 --> 0:5:8,65
So let me fold this in.


130
0:5:8,65 --> 0:5:9,9
Ah, this is great.


131
0:5:9,9 --> 0:5:12,682



132
0:5:12,682 --> 0:5:14,1
Good.


133
0:5:14,1 --> 0:5:16,73
And now, as we break this-- the
shear factor-- you start


134
0:5:16,73 --> 0:5:20,3
to see these layers that are
inside that look fantastic.


135
0:5:20,3 --> 0:5:24,84
Let's allow it to flow
like a real glacier.


136
0:5:24,84 --> 0:5:25,26
Perfect.


137
0:5:25,26 --> 0:5:28,1
Notice how it's already
starting to flow.


138
0:5:28,1 --> 0:5:30,62
The weight of this is now
causing it to move down.


139
0:5:30,62 --> 0:5:32,85
And it moves ever so slowly.


140
0:5:32,85 --> 0:5:34,92
That's why this is so good
when we're teaching


141
0:5:34,92 --> 0:5:36,58
kids about a glacier.


142
0:5:36,58 --> 0:5:40,63
You can actually talk about the
glacier receding or the


143
0:5:40,63 --> 0:5:41,75
glacier advancing.


144
0:5:41,75 --> 0:5:44,775
And in this particular case, you
can see how the weight of


145
0:5:44,775 --> 0:5:47,67
the gak here is pushing
this part of it down.


146
0:5:47,67 --> 0:5:50,13
Take a look here
along the edge.


147
0:5:50,13 --> 0:5:52,37
If you were in Alaska, the
naturalists would tell you


148
0:5:52,37 --> 0:5:55,14
that that shoreline, over the
years, actually was picked up


149
0:5:55,14 --> 0:5:55,83
by the glacier.


150
0:5:55,83 --> 0:5:59,56
And you get this glacial silt
that's moving its way in.


151
0:5:59,56 --> 0:6:2,82
And you can see it actually
come into the glacier.


152
0:6:2,82 --> 0:6:5,19
Well, as cool as this is,
nothing compares to standing


153
0:6:5,19 --> 0:6:7,41
in front of a glacier and
actually seeing a piece of the


154
0:6:7,41 --> 0:6:11,9
ice calve off and to hear that
crunching sound of the ice.


155
0:6:11,9 --> 0:6:14,11
Well, we created an experience
called Science at Sea.


156
0:6:14,11 --> 0:6:16,7
We partnered with our friends
at Holland America, and the


157
0:6:16,7 --> 0:6:18,75
whole goal was to take a hundred
science enthusiasts--


158
0:6:18,75 --> 0:6:21,25
people like you-- on a week
long expedition and to go


159
0:6:21,25 --> 0:6:24,29
places that other normal people
couldn't go with some


160
0:6:24,29 --> 0:6:25,95
of the best naturalists
in the world.


161
0:6:25,95 --> 0:6:29,7
Well, that's what we did with
Science at Sea in Glacier Bay.


162
0:6:29,7 --> 0:6:31,466
Take a look at this.


163
0:6:31,466 --> 0:6:59,567

164
0:6:59,567 --> 0:7:1,785
FEMALE SPEAKER: We saw a
breaching humpback whale right


165
0:7:1,785 --> 0:7:3,57
out there, that shore.


166

JOHN SCHEERENS: We're looking
at one of the most exciting


167
0:7:5,52 --> 0:7:8,11
things here in Glacier Bay
National Park, which is a


168
0:7:8,11 --> 0:7:10,46
humpback whale breaching
completely out of the water--


169
0:7:10,46 --> 0:7:14,26
a 40 ton animal throwing most of
its body is completely out


170
0:7:14,26 --> 0:7:15,19
of the water.


171
0:7:15,19 --> 0:7:18,3
We've had a group of probably
35 to 50 people up here all


172
0:7:18,3 --> 0:7:20,85
morning since 8:30-- it's
now about 11:30--


173
0:7:20,85 --> 0:7:22,815
in the rain watching whales.


174
0:7:22,815 --> 0:7:24,93
It's been a pretty exciting
morning out here on our way


175
0:7:24,93 --> 0:7:25,86
into Glacier Bay.


176
0:7:25,86 --> 0:7:27,8
We're just getting started.
