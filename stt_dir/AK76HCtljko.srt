1
0:0:0,8 --> 0:0:5,9
barbour county junior mister iron man
mister are meant to with their arm and


2
0:0:5,9 --> 0:0:5,94
three


3
0:0:5,94 --> 0:0:9,199
do you know how much he made for the
avengers


4
0:0:9,199 --> 0:0:13,289
tout over-the-top bombastic piece of
summer popcorn flick


5
0:0:13,289 --> 0:0:14,459
fifty


6
0:0:14,459 --> 0:0:16,199
million


7
0:0:16,199 --> 0:0:20,159
i thought for sure the million for sure
it is a fifty bucks and i was like you


8
0:0:20,159 --> 0:0:24,98
know what you got ron beloved no like
probably do it for free but yap


9
0:0:24,98 --> 0:0:27,759
can fate


10
0:0:27,759 --> 0:0:32,34
all not let's put that into a little bit
of perspective just that


11
0:0:32,34 --> 0:0:34,1
compared to what the other people made


12
0:0:34,1 --> 0:0:37,749
uh... chris hamesha represented jeremy
ryder margaret cho bill would be between


13
0:0:37,749 --> 0:0:39,329
two and three million


14
0:0:39,329 --> 0:0:41,499
and then that the other big two stars


15
0:0:41,499 --> 0:0:44,34
uh... seminar jackson's character hanson
maybe between


16
0:0:44,34 --> 0:0:46,0
four and six million


17
0:0:46,0 --> 0:0:50,8
so he's still made more than all of them
were combined to just be in that little


18
0:0:50,8 --> 0:0:53,41
suit and had to do all the tricks you
know why


19
0:0:53,41 --> 0:0:54,62
the cease-fire


20
0:0:54,62 --> 0:0:58,11
he's it's just because i mean schooler
than the rest of the things you know


21
0:0:58,11 --> 0:0:59,16
course right now


22
0:0:59,16 --> 0:1:1,43
crafted actually free market here next


23
0:1:1,43 --> 0:1:3,739
it does make some sense and i'll tell
you one


24
0:1:3,739 --> 0:1:6,84
it looked as you look at his people go
through the member because he probably


25
0:1:6,84 --> 0:1:12,1
had a blast through it will live in


26
0:1:12,1 --> 0:1:14,62
got anything like institute in little
rock


27
0:1:14,62 --> 0:1:17,59
and what's what why it's so interesting
about this up


28
0:1:17,59 --> 0:1:20,32
because almost other characters


29
0:1:20,32 --> 0:1:22,929
didn't necessarily since the four
candidate


30
0:1:22,929 --> 0:1:26,159
comic book character rested but they
could have been plagued by different


31
0:1:26,159 --> 0:1:30,15
actors at that point week-and-a-half
enable really 'cause


32
0:1:30,15 --> 0:1:32,36
there was an established


33
0:1:32,36 --> 0:1:33,26
ready


34
0:1:33,26 --> 0:1:35,919
it we have hoped movie with a couple
nuns


35
0:1:35,919 --> 0:1:38,1
but it's a little blockbusters wrist


36
0:1:38,1 --> 0:1:42,3
iron man isn't absolute golden
blockbuster


37
0:1:42,3 --> 0:1:45,0
and it's robert downey so it is always


38
0:1:45,0 --> 0:1:48,24
in order give him in the movie any time
in a movie


39
0:1:48,24 --> 0:1:52,49
they had to pay a king's ransom yeah so
and that's why he had


40
0:1:52,49 --> 0:1:55,25
more leverage than other star right now
this also has to do with that he got


41
0:1:55,25 --> 0:1:57,2
bonuses and other compensation


42
0:1:57,2 --> 0:2:0,369
and there's all kind of risks when you
have a good guys got quite a history of


43
0:2:0,369 --> 0:2:2,83
drug use and showing up late and all
that has a


44
0:2:2,83 --> 0:2:6,35
but he's kinda clean himself up for
fifty million bucks i would clean myself


45
0:2:6,35 --> 0:2:10,399
up to out yeah yeah i mean for fifty
million bucks if i get on crackdown


46
0:2:10,399 --> 0:2:12,849
perhaps


47
0:2:12,849 --> 0:2:16,309
exactly is there much is there anything
you would do for a very very job


48
0:2:16,309 --> 0:2:19,22
for fifty million box that you would not
be distracted by


49
0:2:19,22 --> 0:2:23,59
this is just plain act that you know yet
apparently being a lawyer


50
0:2:23,59 --> 0:2:27,379
that would be mademoiselle who did it
and yeah i was coming out when you take


51
0:2:27,379 --> 0:2:30,579
fifty million orbit that was so painful


52
0:2:30,579 --> 0:2:34,14
if they said you were to give you fifty
million dollars we want your soul 'cause


53
0:2:34,14 --> 0:2:35,829
that's what they take great right


54
0:2:35,829 --> 0:2:41,219
could you go back crude you do it work
for corporate law firm honestly itp one


55
0:2:41,219 --> 0:2:43,269
hundred-percent depends on the timeframe


56
0:2:43,269 --> 0:2:48,16
you're saying one year unlike all
corporate you dot darn larry


57
0:2:48,16 --> 0:2:49,91
to is usually a good way to use it


58
0:2:49,91 --> 0:2:52,709
is so precious terrible as this is that


59
0:2:52,709 --> 0:2:54,879
uh... lit


60
0:2:54,879 --> 0:2:56,0
if you say


61
0:2:56,0 --> 0:2:58,79
twenty years


62
0:2:58,79 --> 0:3:1,359
and i look people might think i might
ask for say no but i gotta held onto


63
0:3:1,359 --> 0:3:1,989
them


64
0:3:1,989 --> 0:3:5,369
i mean that's because you only live once
you all but i was there


65
0:3:5,369 --> 0:3:7,79

68
0:3:13,5 --> 0:3:17,51
but what was the fifty billion worth
danny was supported four react animated


69
0:3:17,51 --> 0:3:20,839
you lost the twenty prime years of your
life in the course make mike


70
0:3:20,839 --> 0:3:24,959
but i guess what the main part of this
articles about them


71
0:3:24,959 --> 0:3:27,999
is the amount of money that is being
played on you know we're paying now what


72
0:3:27,999 --> 0:3:30,529
would you pay to go to movies like
twelve thirteen bucks if not more


73
0:3:30,529 --> 0:3:31,64
three-d_ it's like


74
0:3:31,64 --> 0:3:35,53
seventeen box around in l_a_ insanity
and i hadn't even been to the movies in


75
0:3:35,53 --> 0:3:38,729
l_a_ in l_a_ like over there's a super
special


76
0:3:38,729 --> 0:3:42,6
freedom of religion in israel or

something and so singer it around in

general area and so heritage address
that in oregon


79
0:3:51,299 --> 0:3:55,979
so by british citizen and you know some
lady comes and anyway


80
0:3:55,979 --> 0:3:59,339
it's not anticipated exaggeration aside


81
0:3:59,339 --> 0:4:2,679
seventeen dollars ninety dollars you
like


82
0:4:2,679 --> 0:4:5,879
for pricing what about what you had a
lot less threatening a resort or well


83
0:4:5,879 --> 0:4:9,679
we've it's digital production and then a
three-d_ sound about our blah but


84
0:4:9,679 --> 0:4:10,719
clearly


85
0:4:10,719 --> 0:4:12,849
fifty million


86
0:4:12,849 --> 0:4:17,239
for robert downey junior i hope you guys

87
0:4:17,239 --> 0:4:23,51
yep so and look at the fighting is the
vendors like


88
0:4:23,51 --> 0:4:28,87
let responding are right enough you know
uh... thomas roberts from msnbc


89
0:4:28,87 --> 0:4:30,169
middletown


90
0:4:30,169 --> 0:4:31,65
back at him you


91
0:4:31,65 --> 0:4:32,599
uh... i know i know


92
0:4:32,599 --> 0:4:36,479
nobody's looked at as well the person be
in mainstream media


93
0:4:36,479 --> 0:4:38,91
so and i've been a mess of aidid


94
0:4:38,91 --> 0:4:42,56
bizarre reason for me it but it is
obvious why have


95
0:4:42,56 --> 0:4:46,55
whenever i see the other anchors
especially msnbc anchor that italy's


96
0:4:46,55 --> 0:4:47,11
unlike


97
0:4:47,11 --> 0:4:48,919
with are excellent


98
0:4:48,919 --> 0:4:50,379
uh... that's a little bit


99
0:4:50,379 --> 0:4:53,909
but there's something kinda grow every
time i see it you know the movie contact


100
0:4:53,909 --> 0:4:57,699
had time to the c_n_n_ people deep
impact that the media it's kinda msnbc


101
0:4:57,699 --> 0:4:58,389
has


102
0:4:58,389 --> 0:5:1,61
and it's like and find it very
frightening because then it shows how


103
0:5:1,61 --> 0:5:2,72
much here


104
0:5:2,72 --> 0:5:4,37
is involved in


105
0:5:4,37 --> 0:5:8,2
actually work what we do anything to
take that mask away and it's kinda


106
0:5:8,2 --> 0:5:11,72
disturbing you know you're absolutely
right and that's exactly why i would


107
0:5:11,72 --> 0:5:16,69
definitely noite at you're right but i
think i might add that the other side of


108
0:5:16,69 --> 0:5:18,729
the reader of bsnl


109
0:5:18,729 --> 0:7:18,729

adventures ok soviet please
