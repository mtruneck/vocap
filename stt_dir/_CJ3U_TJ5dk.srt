the empress of china began constructing
a great defensive walls to protect the


3
0:0:9,8 --> 0:0:15,99
northern frontiers


4
0:0:15,99 --> 0:0:23,22

air


7
0:0:31,73 --> 0:0:33,99
finally into sixteenth-century

0:0:33,99 --> 0:0:38,41
they built the greatest fortifications
ever created by humans


9
0:0:38,41 --> 0:0:39,409
colossus

0:0:58,72 --> 0:1:7,45
what made the middle kingdom build this
giant walls frontier

walls that sneak across thousands of


14
0:1:11,14 --> 0:1:18,98
condolences of north china


15
0:1:18,98 --> 0:1:24,48
most of these walls to say about the
world they were built to protect


16
0:1:24,48 --> 0:1:25,33
armies of two

the great wall

21
0:1:50,28 --> 0:1:52,62
the final years of the eighteenth

we'll see about that content


55
0:3:47,259 --> 0:4:7,569

66
0:5:27,2 --> 0:5:29,639
nothing to keep the englishman in their
countries


67
0:5:29,639 --> 0:5:33,589
they scrambled over the wall overwhelmed
by the admiration for the architects and


68
0:5:33,589 --> 0:5:46,4
builders of the structure

though few of them had ever visited to

76
0:6:10,59 --> 0:6:13,68
note mccartney was otherwise less than
impressed by chinese cultural


77
0:6:13,68 --> 0:6:15,439
achievements


78
0:6:15,439 --> 0:6:20,5
but overwhelmed by this most stupendous
with good human hands


79
0:6:20,5 --> 0:6:22,12
he continued


80
0:6:22,12 --> 0:6:26,119
this war was built above two hundred
years before the christian era


81
0:6:26,119 --> 0:6:30,99
china must to be not only a very
powerful empire but a very wise and


82
0:6:30,99 --> 0:6:31,789
virtuous nation


83
0:6:31,789 --> 0:6:32,94
to establish a once


84
0:6:32,94 --> 0:6:38,439
what was then sort of perpetual security
for against future invasion


85
0:6:38,439 --> 0:6:41,749
the occurrence of these first european
tourists


86
0:6:41,749 --> 0:6:45,659
has influenced our image of the great
wall ever since


87
0:6:45,659 --> 0:6:48,869
with these british visitors have no idea
that the stone colossus they were


88
0:6:48,869 --> 0:6:52,549
admiring was only about two hundred
years old


89
0:6:52,549 --> 0:6:55,46
this huge structure has been built in
the sixteenth century


90
0:6:55,46 --> 0:6:58,239
to stand guard over the heart of the
middle kingdom


91
0:6:58,239 --> 0:7:1,969
after that would be cool costs pending
the gateway for an invasion that shook


92
0:7:1,969 --> 0:7:9,629
the empire to its core


93
0:7:9,629 --> 0:7:14,599
the story begins in beijing


94
0:7:14,599 --> 0:7:17,27
this is where the emperor of the named
in the students


95
0:7:17,27 --> 0:7:19,27
in the forbidden city


96
0:7:19,27 --> 0:7:21,289
this is the center of the world


97
0:7:21,289 --> 0:7:31,59
from here the emperor rules over


98
0:7:31,59 --> 0:7:35,819
in stranded audiences the son of heaven
demonstrates his power


99
0:7:35,819 --> 0:7:39,16
hundreds gather in front of the whole of
perfect harmony


100
0:7:39,16 --> 0:7:42,39
to pay homage to the amruta


101
0:7:42,39 --> 0:7:44,16
like everything else that happens at
court


102
0:7:44,16 --> 0:7:58,8
the ceremony follows a strict ritual


103
0:7:58,8 --> 0:8:2,39
estate without which you will is a plow
without the blade


104
0:8:2,39 --> 0:8:3,319
they say


105
0:8:3,319 --> 0:8:5,4
i'd like the pole star in the heavens


106
0:8:5,4 --> 0:8:8,21
the emperor stands at the center of the
earth


107
0:8:8,21 --> 0:8:9,15
he's the head


108
0:8:9,15 --> 0:8:21,139
at the center point of the middle
kingdom


109
0:8:21,139 --> 0:8:23,98
none hardly any other ruler of the named
in this state


110
0:8:23,98 --> 0:8:27,61
embodies this principle more than
encourage edging


111
0:8:27,61 --> 0:8:44,23
who sat on the dragon throne since
fifteen twenty two


112
0:8:44,23 --> 0:8:46,3
china regarding authority


113
0:8:46,3 --> 0:8:55,21
as ball bearings


114
0:8:55,21 --> 0:8:58,84
diplomatic contacts in trade relations
with other people's


115
0:8:58,84 --> 0:9:2,12
are considered entirely unnecessary


116
0:9:2,12 --> 0:9:5,79
middle kingdom is sufficient unto itself


117
0:9:5,79 --> 0:9:9,89
even the rights to pay tribute to the
emperor isn't another only the emperor


118
0:9:9,89 --> 0:9:19,95
himself common ground


119
0:9:19,95 --> 0:9:25,81
delegation of mongolian nomads appeared
before the officials of the new computer


120
0:9:25,81 --> 0:9:28,25
they have a message for emperor judging


121
0:9:28,25 --> 0:9:42,66
half of the last time the mongols osti

122
0:9:42,66 --> 0:9:44,19
they bring valuable gift


123
0:9:44,19 --> 0:9:47,86
in the hope that the emperor will
present to defeat returned


124
0:9:47,86 --> 0:10:1,83
only when this which was completed
country can begin


125
0:10:1,83 --> 0:10:4,29
the delegation has come from whole heart


126
0:10:4,29 --> 0:10:9,51
headquarters of the mumbled prince out
and cut


127
0:10:9,51 --> 0:10:21,58
is just four hundred kilometers from the
pentagon city


128
0:10:21,58 --> 0:10:25,6
i found confidence in the policies had
built on chinese lines


129
0:10:25,6 --> 0:10:29,25
he's a great admirer of chinese culture
and he's broken with the tradition of


130
0:10:29,25 --> 0:10:32,2
his fourth scandal


131
0:10:32,2 --> 0:10:34,92
he's the first movie this inserting
descon


132
0:10:34,92 --> 0:10:47,71
to build a permanent fortified city


133
0:10:47,71 --> 0:10:52,57
refuse peoples to live in units the
traditional round tense of the movements


134
0:10:52,57 --> 0:11:1,74
of the state


135
0:11:1,74 --> 0:11:3,93
they live in tiny from the knife stock


136
0:11:3,93 --> 0:11:5,79
wondering over this step


137
0:11:5,79 --> 0:11:20,66
they pitch their units wherever they
find grazing land for their herds


138
0:11:20,66 --> 0:11:25,33
for the weakest of the new man's the
children the elderly the long winter's


139
0:11:25,33 --> 0:11:27,39
armed struggle for survival


140
0:11:27,39 --> 0:11:29,42
many don't make it through


141
0:11:29,42 --> 0:11:35,98
the chinese to the south who will about
their suffering


142
0:11:35,98 --> 0:11:38,25
chinese sources report


143
0:11:38,25 --> 0:11:43,68
in spring they often bago patrols to buy
the cattle one dogs for because also of


144
0:11:43,68 --> 0:11:45,73
rice or beans


145
0:11:45,73 --> 0:11:49,92
some would bring hides all horse hair
hoping to stave off starvation for one


146
0:11:49,92 --> 0:11:58,68
more day


147
0:11:58,68 --> 0:12:0,93
for the no-man's there's no way out


148
0:12:0,93 --> 0:12:4,47
only trade with the chinese neighbors
could possess an indigenous rice and


149
0:12:4,47 --> 0:12:5,249
grain


150
0:12:5,249 --> 0:12:20,95
could bring an end to the hardship


151
0:12:20,95 --> 0:12:24,96
between the imperial palace behind the
walls of the forbidden city


152
0:12:24,96 --> 0:12:28,11
no one is interested in the barbarians
troubles


153
0:12:28,11 --> 0:12:29,8
here in the center of the world


154
0:12:29,8 --> 0:12:33,3
the rooms priorities to carry out the
prescribed rituals that will guarantee


155
0:12:33,3 --> 0:12:46,5
you order indeed business


156
0:12:46,5 --> 0:12:50,12
even having to consider all the time
comes request of trade relations is an


157
0:12:50,12 --> 0:12:52,34
affront to the emperor


158
0:12:52,34 --> 0:13:3,64
the idea of trading on equal terms with
the mongols is completely unimaginable


159
0:13:3,64 --> 0:13:7,84
the emperor had already demanded that
the character representing barbarians


160
0:13:7,84 --> 0:13:15,36
had to be written as small as possible
for official documents


161
0:13:15,36 --> 0:13:18,12
prices put on our time cons head


162
0:13:18,12 --> 0:13:40,18
and future mongolian ambassadors will be
executed


163
0:13:40,18 --> 0:13:44,1
with the chinese peasants who reportedly
gmail exactly what the emperor's policy


164
0:13:44,1 --> 0:13:45,92
with


165
0:13:45,92 --> 0:14:12,72
no no no that's will take with force for
the emperor has denied


166
0:14:12,72 --> 0:14:21,51
the peasants don't have long to wait


167
0:14:21,51 --> 0:14:25,67
mongol horseman streamed across the
empires northern borders


168
0:14:25,67 --> 0:14:28,81
the wheel of history which is revolved
around violence and planned uh... for


169
0:14:28,81 --> 0:14:31,4
more than one thousand five hundred
years


170
0:14:31,4 --> 0:14:56,83
is turning again


171
0:14:56,83 --> 0:14:58,499
that was the mongols spat


172
0:14:58,499 --> 0:15:8,59
we'll start with the ravaged fields


173
0:15:8,59 --> 0:15:9,699
go to work on


174
0:15:9,699 --> 0:15:13,639
included in the city that was two
schools of thought she had two different


175
0:15:13,639 --> 0:15:16,94
views as to how to put an end to the
raids


176
0:15:16,94 --> 0:15:22,54
once i dont get free trade relations the
other wanted military response basic


177
0:15:22,54 --> 0:15:26,889
adventures responds carried the risk of
defeat since they couldn't agree on


178
0:15:26,889 --> 0:15:39,44
trade all of all they made a compromise
she's treaty


179
0:15:39,44 --> 0:15:44,51
das was the decision explained to the
deep and profound denounced


180
0:15:44,51 --> 0:15:46,92
barbarians prefers aggression


181
0:15:46,92 --> 0:15:55,72
we are more subdued traditions


182
0:15:55,72 --> 0:15:59,1
cannot do the emperor demeanor


183
0:15:59,1 --> 0:16:12,56
leader of the border troops reports to
the forbidden city to receive his orders

commander of the capital's defense


186
0:16:20,41 --> 0:16:22,72

his mission is to use force together
sins of document receipt


188
0:16:27,34 --> 0:16:37,62
to secure the capital


189
0:16:37,62 --> 0:16:41,72
when one does fortifications to the
northwest of beijing form part of a much


190
0:16:41,72 --> 0:16:46,16
larger distances to the nine border
garrisons


191
0:16:46,16 --> 0:16:48,319
instrument like deeds on a chain


192
0:16:48,319 --> 0:16:53,39
derived from the easternmost to the
western most point of the chinese empire


193
0:16:53,39 --> 0:16:55,27
last outpost in the west


194

only the five thousand five hundred
meter peaks of mt she did


199
0:17:7,71 --> 0:17:8,53
stands higher


200
0:17:8,53 --> 0:17:15,7
than the powerful fortress


201
0:17:15,7 --> 0:17:18,55
according to legend the master builder
of the forts calculated the construction


202
0:17:18,55 --> 0:17:20,63
materials so precisely


203
0:17:20,63 --> 0:17:28,63
that when they finished just one break
