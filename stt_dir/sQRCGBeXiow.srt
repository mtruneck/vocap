1
0:0:14,0 --> 0:0:19,88
Buddhism is one of the most ancient
belief systems in the world.


2
0:0:19,88 --> 0:0:22,52
Buddhism is both a religion
and a philosophy.


3
0:0:22,52 --> 0:0:26,6
Only your own understanding
saves you from suffering.


4
0:0:26,6 --> 0:0:31,56
It is practised by over
350 million people today.


5
0:0:31,56 --> 0:0:36,56
There are many people who feel
attracted to a religion


6
0:0:36,56 --> 0:0:40,2
which empowers the human individual.


7
0:0:40,2 --> 0:0:44,8
I am going to travel to seven
wonders of the Buddhist world.


8
0:0:44,8 --> 0:0:47,2
Seven wonders
that give an insight


9
0:0:47,2 --> 0:0:50,12
to the long and rich history
of Buddhism.


10
0:0:50,12 --> 0:0:53,6
At each location I'll meet Buddhists
who will help me to understand


11
0:0:53,6 --> 0:0:58,12
the different concepts that form
the core of Buddhist belief.


12
0:0:58,12 --> 0:1:3,56
I'm going to explore how it started,
where it travelled


13
0:1:3,56 --> 0:1:9,4
and some of the most spectacular
monuments built by Buddhists


14
0:1:9,4 --> 0:1:14,0
right across the globe.


15
0:1:14,0 --> 0:1:19,8
And to try to get to the bottom of
the attraction of this philosophy
for mankind


16
0:1:19,8 --> 0:1:26,32
for close on 2,500 years.


17
0:1:26,32 --> 0:1:29,36
Buddhism's numbers grow
year on year


18
0:1:29,36 --> 0:1:31,64
and I'll be uncovering why


19
0:1:31,64 --> 0:1:54,28
as I experience seven
modern and ancient wonders
of the Buddhist world.


20
0:1:54,28 --> 0:1:56,2
This is north-eastern India,


21
0:1:56,2 --> 0:2:0,48
where Buddhism began
around 500 years before Christ.


22
0:2:0,48 --> 0:2:5,52
Millions of pilgrims come to this
country, and to the sacred
city of Bodh Gaya,


23
0:2:5,52 --> 0:2:8,6
to visit the place where a young
Indian Prince underwent


24
0:2:8,6 --> 0:2:10,92
a life-changing
personal transformation


25
0:2:10,92 --> 0:2:14,4
and came to be known as the Buddha.


26
0:2:14,4 --> 0:2:19,52
I've studied the period in history
when the Buddha lived
for over 20 years


27
0:2:19,52 --> 0:2:21,56
and I just love it


28
0:2:21,56 --> 0:2:25,96
because this was such a radical age.


29
0:2:25,96 --> 0:2:28,28
This was a time when men
like the Buddha,


30
0:2:28,28 --> 0:2:30,64
and Socrates in Ancient Greece,


31
0:2:30,64 --> 0:2:33,56
turned the world of belief
upside down.


32
0:2:33,56 --> 0:2:39,84
Instead of focusing on tradition
and convention and ritual,


33
0:2:39,84 --> 0:2:48,6
they dealt with ethics and the
possibilities of the human mind.


34
0:2:48,6 --> 0:2:53,44
And I'm particularly fascinated to
follow in the trail of Buddhism,


35
0:2:53,44 --> 0:2:57,52
because as the philosophy has
travelled through 25 centuries,


36
0:2:57,52 --> 0:3:1,24
it's marked out a path
that leads directly


37
0:3:1,24 --> 0:3:7,88
from ancient society
to the modern world.


38
0:3:7,88 --> 0:3:9,84
This is Mahabodhi,


39
0:3:9,84 --> 0:3:14,8
the "great awakening" temple
in Bodh Gaya in north-eastern India,


40
0:3:14,8 --> 0:3:26,56
our first
wonder of the Buddhist world.


41
0:3:26,56 --> 0:3:28,96
The reason Bodh Gaya is here at all


42
0:3:28,96 --> 0:3:32,68
is because two and a half millennia
ago, one man


43
0:3:32,68 --> 0:3:35,52
had an internal, personal revelation


44
0:3:35,52 --> 0:3:38,2
while he sat underneath
a peepul tree.


45
0:3:38,2 --> 0:3:47,92
It's a very quiet, simple beginning
to end up with all of this.


46
0:3:47,92 --> 0:3:51,48
That man was called
Siddhartha Gautama,


47
0:3:51,48 --> 0:3:55,0
and we're told he renounced
his privileges and family


48
0:3:55,0 --> 0:3:58,48
to embark on a rigorous quest.


49
0:3:58,48 --> 0:4:2,56
A journey to understand the inherent
challenges of the human condition,


50
0:4:2,56 --> 0:4:6,64
sparked by the suffering, sorrow
and deprivation


51
0:4:6,64 --> 0:4:10,64
that he saw all around him.


52
0:4:10,64 --> 0:4:13,52
It was a long
and difficult journey.


53
0:4:13,52 --> 0:4:17,16
Siddhartha renounced
the comforts of the material world.


54
0:4:17,16 --> 0:4:19,84
He meditated for weeks on end.


55
0:4:19,84 --> 0:4:22,0
He broke with the status quo


56
0:4:22,0 --> 0:4:25,4
in a region that had been
dominated by the old gods


57
0:4:25,4 --> 0:4:27,16
for the previous thousand years.


58
0:4:27,16 --> 0:4:30,96
Finally he achieved Nirvana,


59
0:4:30,96 --> 0:4:34,24
what we loosely translate
as Enlightenment,


60
0:4:34,24 --> 0:4:41,32
and became known as the Buddha
or "the enlightened one".


61
0:4:41,32 --> 0:4:44,16
The Buddha,
according to Buddhist scriptures,


62
0:4:44,16 --> 0:4:47,8
made his way to this spot,
and determined not to move


63
0:4:47,8 --> 0:4:51,88
until he found an answer
to the world's suffering.


64
0:4:51,88 --> 0:4:57,96
So, it was here, on one warm
spring evening, 2,500 years ago,


65
0:4:57,96 --> 0:5:0,52
that the Buddha came to sit.


66
0:5:0,52 --> 0:5:5,52
We are told that all night
he was tormented by demons


67
0:5:5,52 --> 0:5:18,8
but then, as the sun began to rise
in the East, he found enlightenment.


68
0:5:18,8 --> 0:5:20,76
The Bodh Gaya temple is the Mecca
of Buddhism.


69
0:5:20,76 --> 0:5:23,16
It is where the Buddha
attained enlightenment


70
0:5:23,16 --> 0:5:24,6
according to their belief


71
0:5:24,6 --> 0:5:28,44
and the Bodhi tree, or a great-
grandson of the Bodhi tree,


72
0:5:28,44 --> 0:5:29,8
still grows there.


73
0:5:29,8 --> 0:5:32,72
So, Buddhists go there to remember
the great breakthrough


74
0:5:32,72 --> 0:5:36,2
that was the Buddha's discovery
of the true nature of the universe.


75
0:5:36,2 --> 0:5:38,84
And inspired by
the Buddha's example,


76
0:5:38,84 --> 0:5:42,8
you'll find visitors here
from every corner of the globe,


77
0:5:42,8 --> 0:5:47,36
from the 90 or so countries where
Buddhism still flourishes today.


78
0:5:47,36 --> 0:5:50,4
Bodh Gaya is one of those key sites


79
0:5:50,4 --> 0:5:52,56
for all Buddhists worldwide.


80
0:5:52,56 --> 0:5:57,8
It serves as a magnet,
as a centre point,
for Buddhists from around the world.


81
0:5:57,8 --> 0:6:0,32
You could say it's the place


82
0:6:0,32 --> 0:6:3,88
exactly where Buddhism started.


83
0:6:3,88 --> 0:6:7,84
I'm not a Buddhist, but if you ask
anyone who's involved in Buddhism,


84
0:6:7,84 --> 0:6:11,36
they'll tell you that
it's a very difficult philosophy


85
0:6:11,36 --> 0:6:13,44
to teach or to explain,


86
0:6:13,44 --> 0:6:18,8
and that the very best way to
understand it is to experience it.


87
0:6:18,8 --> 0:6:21,56
And so, by experiencing Buddhism,


88
0:6:21,56 --> 0:6:24,72
I'm going to try to get to the heart
of a philosophy


89
0:6:24,72 --> 0:6:28,8
that can sometimes seem complicated,
out of reach.


90
0:6:28,8 --> 0:6:31,16
I'll start with the three
key principles of Buddhism -


91
0:6:31,16 --> 0:6:36,48
what are known as
its "Three Jewels".


92
0:6:36,48 --> 0:6:43,6
The first is the life
and example of Buddha himself.


93
0:6:43,6 --> 0:6:50,92
All Buddhists are encouraged to
model their approach to life on his.


94
0:6:50,92 --> 0:6:56,76
The most important single point
in the Buddha's teaching,


95
0:6:56,76 --> 0:7:1,28
and one that distinguishes it
very sharply from other religions,


96
0:7:1,28 --> 0:7:5,32
is that the Buddha taught
that each of us


97
0:7:5,32 --> 0:7:9,88
is entirely and solely responsible


98
0:7:9,88 --> 0:7:13,84
for our own lives
and our own salvation.


99
0:7:13,84 --> 0:7:19,32
No-one else can be responsible.


100
0:7:19,32 --> 0:7:22,2
The Buddha didn't claim
any divine status,


101
0:7:22,2 --> 0:7:25,0
nor did he profess
to be a personal saviour.


102
0:7:25,0 --> 0:7:27,88
He called himself
a guide and teacher.


103
0:7:27,88 --> 0:7:32,32
His message appealed to people of
all social classes in ancient India,


104
0:7:32,32 --> 0:7:35,92
to merchants, to farmers,
and to the Untouchable caste.


105
0:7:35,92 --> 0:7:39,92
The Buddha, in the course
of his spiritual awakening,


106
0:7:39,92 --> 0:7:43,24
rejected a good number of aspects
of Hinduism.


107
0:7:43,24 --> 0:7:47,4
He rejected some philosophical
components of Hindu beliefs,


108
0:7:47,4 --> 0:7:51,64
he was very critical of the
position of the Brahmins or priests


109
0:7:51,64 --> 0:7:55,52
in society at that time,
which was a very elitist position.


110
0:7:55,52 --> 0:7:58,32
He was similarly critical
of the caste system.


111
0:7:58,32 --> 0:8:2,84
He positioned himself, as a result,
outside of the caste system.


112
0:8:2,84 --> 0:8:8,12
The Buddha spent his remaining years
travelling through deep forests,


113
0:8:8,12 --> 0:8:11,12
across mango groves,
from village to village.


114
0:8:11,12 --> 0:8:13,4
The curious would bring
food and clothing


115
0:8:13,4 --> 0:8:15,88
for the philosopher
and his band of followers.


116
0:8:15,88 --> 0:8:18,24
And, in turn, he encouraged them


117
0:8:18,24 --> 0:8:21,6
to reconsider the purpose
and point of life,


118
0:8:21,6 --> 0:8:27,2
to recalibrate their moral compass.


119
0:8:27,2 --> 0:8:32,8
Although the Buddha didn't establish
a church or temple system as such,


120
0:8:32,8 --> 0:8:35,32
over time, the significant
locations in his life


121
0:8:35,32 --> 0:8:39,84
were gradually turned into shrines.


122
0:8:39,84 --> 0:8:43,48
Originally Bodh Gaya was just
a pastoral sanctuary,


123
0:8:43,48 --> 0:8:46,8
marked out with
a stone balustrade,


124
0:8:46,8 --> 0:8:50,32
200 years or so after his death,
but by the 6th century AD,


125
0:8:50,32 --> 0:8:54,8
a full-blown temple,
the Mahabodhi Temple,


126
0:8:54,8 --> 0:8:58,2
marked the spot.


127
0:8:58,2 --> 0:9:0,72
About 400 years after,
the first temple,


128
0:9:0,72 --> 0:9:3,56
that was built here for the
worshiping of the Bodhi tree,


129
0:9:3,56 --> 0:9:7,4
was replaced by this kind
of a temple, built to enshrine


130
0:9:7,4 --> 0:9:12,36
the iconic image of Buddha, which
had gained currency by that time.


131
0:9:12,36 --> 0:9:16,28
The temple,
particularly the Mahabodhi Temple,


132
0:9:16,28 --> 0:9:19,84
is representative of how important
Buddhist temples were,


133
0:9:19,84 --> 0:9:24,48
and how, you know, this idea of
building a temple to enshrine statues


134
0:9:24,48 --> 0:9:32,6
started from here.


135
0:9:32,6 --> 0:9:35,6
As Buddhism's travelled through
the centuries,


136
0:9:35,6 --> 0:9:39,76
perhaps inevitably, it's taken on
more the aspects of a religion,


137
0:9:39,76 --> 0:9:46,32
with temples and pilgrims
and a religious hierarchy.


138
0:9:46,32 --> 0:9:48,92
You could be forgiven
for mistaking Buddhism


139
0:9:48,92 --> 0:9:53,16
as one of the great,
god-driven faiths of the world,


140
0:9:53,16 --> 0:9:55,72
but there is a key difference.


141
0:9:55,72 --> 0:9:59,64
By putting such an emphasis
on a system of personal morality


142
0:9:59,64 --> 0:10:3,48
and breaking with the conventions
and traditions


143
0:10:3,48 --> 0:10:5,4
and rituals of the past,


144
0:10:5,4 --> 0:10:8,4
in many ways, the Buddha was
one of those men


145
0:10:8,4 --> 0:10:9,96
who gave us the modern world.


146
0:10:9,96 --> 0:10:13,8
And although he never denied
that there were gods,


147
0:10:13,8 --> 0:10:15,44
he simply said


148
0:10:15,44 --> 0:10:21,56
you don't have to rely on the
gods to make everything OK.


149
0:10:21,56 --> 0:10:23,8
According to Buddhist sources,


150
0:10:23,8 --> 0:10:26,64
having seeded a radical
new world view,


151
0:10:26,64 --> 0:10:30,36
the Buddha died at the age of 84.


152
0:10:30,36 --> 0:10:35,16
His body was cremated
but his bones remained unburned.


153
0:10:35,16 --> 0:10:39,8
They were distributed amongst the
various tribes, rulers and kingdoms,


154
0:10:39,8 --> 0:10:42,6
who are now starting
to follow the Buddhist way,


155
0:10:42,6 --> 0:10:47,12
and who honoured its founder
by building monuments, or stupas,


156
0:10:47,12 --> 0:10:49,8
over his remains.


157
0:10:49,8 --> 0:10:55,68
In Kathmandu, the capital city of
Nepal, stands The Bodanath Stupa,


158
0:10:55,68 --> 0:11:0,56
our second wonder
of the Buddhist world.


159
0:11:0,56 --> 0:11:4,12
It was first built in the 5th
or early 6th centuries AD,


160
0:11:4,12 --> 0:11:7,8
then rebuilt and restored
a number of times,


161
0:11:7,8 --> 0:11:12,8
finally as this giant,
enclosed tomb in the 14th century.


162
0:11:12,8 --> 0:11:16,24
It is the largest
in the Indian subcontinent,


163
0:11:16,24 --> 0:11:22,64
a sacred place for thousands
of Buddhists throughout the world.


164
0:11:22,64 --> 0:11:25,52
Here at Bodanath,
I am going to find out more


165
0:11:25,52 --> 0:11:28,2
about the three jewels of Buddhism.


166
0:11:28,2 --> 0:11:32,4
Buddhism consists,
as far as Buddhists are concerned,


167
0:11:32,4 --> 0:11:34,88
in three things
which they call the three jewels.


168
0:11:34,88 --> 0:11:37,52
Those three things
are closely connected.


169
0:11:37,52 --> 0:11:41,16
The first is the Buddha,
the founder of their religion.


170
0:11:41,16 --> 0:11:43,6
The second is called the Sangha,


171
0:11:43,6 --> 0:11:47,4
and that is the community
of monks and nuns.


172
0:11:47,4 --> 0:11:49,96
The third is called the Dharma.


173
0:11:49,96 --> 0:11:55,0
The Dharma refers to the preaching,
the teaching of the Buddha.


174
0:11:55,0 --> 0:11:59,48
In other words, it's what the Buddha
discovered and it's also the truth.


175
0:11:59,48 --> 0:12:3,12
As you walk around the Bodanath,
here, you always have this sense


176
0:12:3,12 --> 0:12:4,76
that you are being watched


177
0:12:4,76 --> 0:12:7,6
and that's because
the Buddha's all-seeing eyes


178
0:12:7,6 --> 0:12:9,84
are always staring down at you.


179
0:12:9,84 --> 0:12:13,48
That squiggle in the middle of his
face, incidentally, is not his nose,


180
0:12:13,48 --> 0:12:16,88
it's actually the Sanskrit character
for the number one,


181
0:12:16,88 --> 0:12:20,52
to represent a kind of
unity in the Buddhist faith.


182
0:12:20,52 --> 0:12:24,84
Something you won't find represented
up there are the Buddha's ears,


183
0:12:24,84 --> 0:12:27,28
and there is a particular
reason for that.


184
0:12:27,28 --> 0:12:29,36
We are told that the Buddha said


185
0:12:29,36 --> 0:12:35,48
he never wanted to hear
that he was being worshipped.


186
0:12:35,48 --> 0:12:39,28
And of course, that is what is so
unique about Buddhism -


187
0:12:39,28 --> 0:12:43,16
this is a religion without
a central authority figure.


188
0:12:43,16 --> 0:12:48,12
Instead there's just this credo
that man is his own lord and master,


189
0:12:48,12 --> 0:12:56,68
that mankind itself
can control humanity's destiny.


190
0:12:56,68 --> 0:13:0,4
It's not atheistic, because
they do believe in the existence


191
0:13:0,4 --> 0:13:4,12
of, sort of, Gods and angels and so
on, but they simply don't believe


192
0:13:4,12 --> 0:13:6,68
that those beings
have the universe under control


193
0:13:6,68 --> 0:13:9,4
and therefore they cannot
save us from suffering.


194
0:13:9,4 --> 0:13:11,76
They themselves need
saving from suffering


195
0:13:11,76 --> 0:13:14,6
from a future time
when they cease being gods


196
0:13:14,6 --> 0:13:22,12
and they become beings that are
vulnerable to pain and suffering.


197
0:13:22,12 --> 0:13:25,0
At the Bodonath Stupa,
one of the many people who come


198
0:13:25,0 --> 0:13:28,0
to circumambulate and
to pay their respects to the Buddha


199
0:13:28,0 --> 0:13:30,88
is Ani Choying, a Buddhist nun


200
0:13:30,88 --> 0:13:35,92
famous throughout Nepal
for her sweet singing voice.


201
0:13:35,92 --> 0:13:39,52
She is, in fact,
known as the singing nun.


202
0:13:39,52 --> 0:13:43,12
This is a very highly spiritual
place, we consider.


203
0:13:43,12 --> 0:13:45,48
It's a holy place, and we believe


204
0:13:45,48 --> 0:13:49,36
that all the great relics of the
Buddha's are in the stupa


205
0:13:49,36 --> 0:13:53,56
and it holds a very special
religious spot.


206
0:13:53,56 --> 0:13:56,64
And every people
who come around here


207
0:13:56,64 --> 0:13:58,52
are always reciting mantras


208
0:13:58,52 --> 0:14:0,92
and really focusing
on meditation,


209
0:14:0,92 --> 0:14:4,36
they do the circumambulation,
prostration,


210
0:14:4,36 --> 0:14:6,56
to keep the physical healthy


211
0:14:6,56 --> 0:14:10,44
and the mind, to be energy clean,


212
0:14:10,44 --> 0:14:13,92
chanting mantras
as well as doing prayers


213
0:14:13,92 --> 0:14:19,8
so trying to put yourself
in a very good, positive discipline.


214
0:14:19,8 --> 0:14:23,88
This is a very,
very highly blessed place.


215
0:14:23,88 --> 0:14:25,96
Ani is originally from Tibet.


216
0:14:25,96 --> 0:14:30,84
Thousands of Tibetan Buddhists
now live in Nepal as refugees.


217
0:14:30,84 --> 0:14:34,88
The brand of Buddhism is as much
Tibetan as it is Nepalese.


218
0:14:34,88 --> 0:14:39,24
Flexibility and diversity has always
been one of Buddhism's strengths.


219
0:14:39,24 --> 0:14:44,8
The Buddha himself
said there should be no one
official Buddhist language.


220
0:14:44,8 --> 0:14:49,24
Instead, Buddhists are encouraged
to focus on the universal relevance


221
0:14:49,24 --> 0:14:51,68
of the Buddha's wisdom.


222
0:14:51,68 --> 0:14:55,8
There are some people here
who will tell you that


223
0:14:55,8 --> 0:15:0,24
buried deep in that stupa
is a fragment of the Buddha's bone.


224
0:15:0,24 --> 0:15:3,8
Now, I'm not certain that we're
going to be able to prove that


225
0:15:3,8 --> 0:15:7,32
but what is sure
is that this is the biggest stupa


226
0:15:7,32 --> 0:15:11,4
in the whole of Nepal
and one of the largest in the world,


227
0:15:11,4 --> 0:15:14,44
and it is immensely impressive,


228
0:15:14,44 --> 0:15:17,88
but do you know what's
significant about it, actually


229
0:15:17,88 --> 0:15:20,12
is not how it looks
but what it means


230
0:15:20,12 --> 0:15:24,8
because this was built to represent
something very special.


231
0:15:24,8 --> 0:15:26,64
For the men who created this,


232
0:15:26,64 --> 0:15:37,2
this was nothing less than
incarnation of the Buddha's mind.


233
0:15:37,2 --> 0:15:40,48
The symbolism of the stupa
is very interesting because


234
0:15:40,48 --> 0:15:45,4
it takes the elements of
earth, water, fire, wind and space,


235
0:15:45,4 --> 0:15:47,56
different shapes
that represent those,


236
0:15:47,56 --> 0:15:50,16
and they put them in an ideal
aesthetic form,


237
0:15:50,16 --> 0:15:54,12
and so the idea is that
the Buddha's mind is the awareness


238
0:15:54,12 --> 0:15:58,72
that the universe is the ideal
environment for the human being


239
0:15:58,72 --> 0:16:3,0
to achieve freedom from suffering.


240
0:16:3,0 --> 0:16:7,24
Around the Buddha
gathered men who shared with him
a common vision and goal.


241
0:16:7,24 --> 0:16:10,84
Gradually, this group
came to be a formalized community,


242
0:16:10,84 --> 0:16:12,48
a body that took its name


243
0:16:12,48 --> 0:16:17,0
from the old aristocratic councils
of the day. The Sangha.


244
0:16:17,0 --> 0:16:19,96
The Buddhist Sangha became
a monastic tradition,


245
0:16:19,96 --> 0:16:22,6
comprising ordained monks and nuns


246
0:16:22,6 --> 0:16:33,24
and it's one of the three
jewels of Buddhism.


247
0:16:33,24 --> 0:16:35,68
My first experience of the Sangha


248
0:16:35,68 --> 0:16:39,72
came at what felt
like an ungodly hour.


249
0:16:39,72 --> 0:16:43,76
At Bodanath every morning,
just after dawn, monks of all ages


250
0:16:43,76 --> 0:16:47,64
gather to perform the first of many
rituals of the day.


251
0:16:47,64 --> 0:16:51,76
The Sangha is one of the oldest
continuously active


252
0:16:51,76 --> 0:16:55,96
spiritual organizations
in the world.


253
0:16:55,96 --> 0:17:3,12
LOW CHANTING


254
0:17:3,12 --> 0:17:6,4
What's being recited here
is a Tara Puja,


255
0:17:6,4 --> 0:17:10,52
it's a chant that aims to ensure
a kind of liberation from suffering.


256
0:17:10,52 --> 0:17:13,88
And it's really interesting
because "Tara" is thought to be


257
0:17:13,88 --> 0:17:16,76
a female manifestation
of Buddha's wisdom,


258
0:17:16,76 --> 0:17:19,16
something which is
incredibly potent.


259
0:17:19,16 --> 0:17:21,96
I mean, this isn't just
an abstract idea of wisdom


260
0:17:21,96 --> 0:17:24,4
this is thought to be healing,


261
0:17:24,4 --> 0:17:28,92
to actually be stronger
than medicine itself.


262
0:17:28,92 --> 0:17:33,6
DRUM BOOMS AND BELLS RING


263
0:17:33,6 --> 0:17:36,44
The Sangha includes
women and was set up


264
0:17:36,44 --> 0:17:39,8
to allow those who wish to
practise Buddha's teachings


265
0:17:39,8 --> 0:17:41,96
a disciplined environment
and maximum time


266
0:17:41,96 --> 0:17:44,88
to focus on the philosopher's ideas,


267
0:17:44,88 --> 0:17:47,88
free from the responsibilities
and distractions


268
0:17:47,88 --> 0:17:53,28
of a domestic or
conventional lifestyle.


269
0:17:53,28 --> 0:17:56,52
A few miles outside Kathmandu,


270
0:17:56,52 --> 0:18:1,48
Ani, the singing nun,
runs her own nunnery.


271
0:18:1,48 --> 0:18:5,6
It's a refuge for girls,
many as young as ten,


272
0:18:5,6 --> 0:18:9,36
the age both sexes can embark
on the life of a Buddhist novice.


273
0:18:9,36 --> 0:18:17,64
SINGING


274
0:18:17,64 --> 0:18:20,4
I have here mostly


275
0:18:20,4 --> 0:18:24,56
girls from families who are
facing some difficulties,


276
0:18:24,56 --> 0:18:28,0
obviously poverty,
and the other thing is


277
0:18:28,0 --> 0:18:30,72
the fathers are often very ignorant.


278
0:18:30,72 --> 0:18:34,68
They get carried away with the
alcoholic behaviour, as well.


279
0:18:34,68 --> 0:18:38,12
Very abusive behaviours, and they
do not think that it is good


280
0:18:38,12 --> 0:18:40,0
to send their girls to school,


281
0:18:40,0 --> 0:18:42,56
so I try to collect them here,


282
0:18:42,56 --> 0:18:45,6
and give them a much
as I can give them.


283
0:18:45,6 --> 0:18:48,76
Controversial for its time
was the inclusion of women


284
0:18:48,76 --> 0:18:50,56
among the ranks of the Sangha.


285
0:18:50,56 --> 0:18:52,96
The Buddha allowed women
to become nuns,


286
0:18:52,96 --> 0:18:56,2
to lead a life devoted
to spiritual development.


287
0:18:56,2 --> 0:19:0,32
Like Buddhist monks, nuns
are expected to remain celibate,


288
0:19:0,32 --> 0:19:5,0
pure, since they are one
of the three jewels of Buddhism,


289
0:19:5,0 --> 0:19:7,2
not just Buddha's foot-soldiers


290
0:19:7,2 --> 0:19:12,72
but an incarnation
of the belief system itself.


291
0:19:12,72 --> 0:19:16,16
So, I've learnt about two
of the three jewels of Buddhism.


292
0:19:16,16 --> 0:19:20,4
The Sangha
and the life of the Buddha.


293
0:19:20,4 --> 0:19:25,32
But what about the third jewel,
the Dharma, or teachings?


294
0:19:25,32 --> 0:19:30,36
You can, perhaps, help me out a bit.
How do you describe Dharma?


295
0:19:30,36 --> 0:19:33,4
What does Dharma mean to you?


296
0:19:33,4 --> 0:19:35,44
According to my understanding,


297
0:19:35,44 --> 0:19:41,16
what Dharma is
to do whatever you do,


298
0:19:41,16 --> 0:19:48,4
very practically, skilfully,
for the benefit of all beings,


299
0:19:48,4 --> 0:19:52,8
without causing any harm,
and for their wellbeing,


300
0:19:52,8 --> 0:20:0,36
including oneself and all, is Dharma.


301
0:20:0,36 --> 0:20:17,72
SHE SINGS:


302
0:20:17,72 --> 0:20:23,2
Dharma means the purity of heart.
Dharma means peace,


303
0:20:23,2 --> 0:20:26,48
and Dharma means wellbeing
of all human society.


304
0:20:26,48 --> 0:20:31,32
Are there special ways
that you can achieve Dharma?


305
0:20:31,32 --> 0:20:34,68
Are there rules and regulations
that show you what to do?


306
0:20:34,68 --> 0:20:40,32
We are taught what causes suffering
and what can cause suffering,


307
0:20:40,32 --> 0:20:46,88
and how to avoid causing suffering
in life, one's own life.


308
0:20:46,88 --> 0:20:51,4
And when you implement
those teachings


309
0:20:51,4 --> 0:20:54,28
I think that is what really
contributes towards


310
0:20:54,28 --> 0:20:57,32
one's own wellbeing
and others' wellbeing,


311
0:20:57,32 --> 0:21:1,56
and I think that
is considered Dharma.


312
0:21:1,56 --> 0:21:6,64
In the Buddhist context,
the word Dharma refers, above all,


313
0:21:6,64 --> 0:21:10,56
to the teachings of the Buddha
as he rediscovered them


314
0:21:10,56 --> 0:21:16,64
in the process of his progress
towards enlightenment.


315
0:21:16,64 --> 0:21:21,28
The reality of the Dharma
which holds you free from suffering,


316
0:21:21,28 --> 0:21:25,24
is what they take, the root of the
word Dharma, which means to hold,


317
0:21:25,24 --> 0:21:36,48
and the Buddha said Dharma
holds a being free from suffering.


318
0:21:36,48 --> 0:21:39,8
Coming here to Nepal, it has been
relatively straightforward


319
0:21:39,8 --> 0:21:44,28
to identify two of the jewels
of the triple jewels of Buddhism.


320
0:21:44,28 --> 0:21:47,28
The Buddha himself,
both ideas about him and his image,


321
0:21:47,28 --> 0:21:50,44
are absolutely everywhere,
as is the Sangha,


322
0:21:50,44 --> 0:21:55,8
and here in Kathmandu,
there are monks and nuns
at every street corner,


323
0:21:55,8 --> 0:22:0,68
but what has been harder to pin down
is the Dharma itself,


324
0:22:0,68 --> 0:22:3,8
the belief system,
the philosophy, the religion,


325
0:22:3,8 --> 0:22:6,64
whatever you want to call it,
of Buddhism.


326
0:22:6,64 --> 0:22:9,16
Maybe it's unrealistic of me
to expect there to be


327
0:22:9,16 --> 0:22:12,96
one single definition
for such a broad concept.


328
0:22:12,96 --> 0:22:15,96
The Buddha himself said
the Dharma was like


329
0:22:15,96 --> 0:22:20,6
the salt of the oceans of the world,
a universal taste.


330
0:22:20,6 --> 0:22:26,44
So, the Buddha implied the Dharma
could be tasted anywhere, by anyone,


331
0:22:26,44 --> 0:22:29,56
but the question for me,
as a historian,


332
0:22:29,56 --> 0:22:34,12
is how that "taste" of the Buddhist
Dharma could become "universal",


333
0:22:34,12 --> 0:22:40,52
practically,
how Buddhism established itself
as a global belief-system.


334
0:22:40,52 --> 0:22:44,0
Buddha's teachings were charismatic
and radical for their time,


335
0:22:44,0 --> 0:22:46,8
but, as with all big new ideas,


336
0:22:46,8 --> 0:22:51,0
they needed a groundswell of popular
support or a patron, or both,


337
0:22:51,0 --> 0:22:54,88
to gain a firm foothold
and to really fly.


338
0:22:54,88 --> 0:22:58,6
While there was grassroots interest
in what he had to say,


339
0:22:58,6 --> 0:23:3,8
it was about 200 years after the
Buddha's death that Buddhism
got a major boost.


340
0:23:3,8 --> 0:23:8,96
In 250BC, the ruthless, all-powerful
emperor Ashoka,


341
0:23:8,96 --> 0:23:10,88
who controlled most of ancient
India,


342
0:23:10,88 --> 0:23:16,8
proved Buddhism's greatest ally.


343
0:23:16,8 --> 0:23:21,36
Ashoka was haunted by the memory
of the blood that he'd acquired


344
0:23:21,36 --> 0:23:25,6
on his hands as a result of the cut
and thrust of his rise to power


345
0:23:25,6 --> 0:23:28,84
and he decided to turn to "the good"


346
0:23:28,84 --> 0:23:31,52
and in order to realize
that ambition


347
0:23:31,52 --> 0:23:34,96
he vigorously promoted
Buddhist ideals


348
0:23:34,96 --> 0:23:38,64
right across the
Indian subcontinent.


349
0:23:38,64 --> 0:23:40,4
According to Buddhist tradition,


350
0:23:40,4 --> 0:23:42,4
in the centuries following Ashoka's


351
0:23:42,4 --> 0:23:44,28
sponsorship of Buddha's ideas,


352
0:23:44,28 --> 0:23:46,32
the philosophy evolved into


353
0:23:46,32 --> 0:23:48,44
at least 18 different schools.


354
0:23:48,44 --> 0:23:50,12
One of these, the Theravada,


355
0:23:50,12 --> 0:23:51,4
still survives today


356
0:23:51,4 --> 0:23:53,44
and is mainly associated


357
0:23:53,44 --> 0:23:55,6
with south and southeast Asia.


358
0:23:55,6 --> 0:23:57,12
Another came to be called


359
0:23:57,12 --> 0:23:58,28
the Mahayana,


360
0:23:58,28 --> 0:24:0,36
the "Great Vehicle" or "Way",


361
0:24:0,36 --> 0:24:5,0
now most often found
in north and east Asia.


362
0:24:5,0 --> 0:24:7,72
Ashoka, by embracing Buddhism,


363
0:24:7,72 --> 0:24:11,4
put a particular emphasis
on the consequences of his actions,


364
0:24:11,4 --> 0:24:14,76
on what he thought
and how he lived in the world.


365
0:24:14,76 --> 0:24:17,4
On his Karma.


366
0:24:17,4 --> 0:24:20,64
Karma is a word
well known in the west today.


367
0:24:20,64 --> 0:24:23,88
It has its roots in
early Indian belief systems,


368
0:24:23,88 --> 0:24:26,32
but the value of Karma became


369
0:24:26,32 --> 0:24:28,16
a fundamentally important


370
0:24:28,16 --> 0:24:30,4
Buddhist concept,


371
0:24:30,4 --> 0:24:32,24
and one that I am going to explore


372
0:24:32,24 --> 0:24:36,76
at...


373
0:24:36,76 --> 0:24:54,92
..our next wonder
of the Buddhist world.


374
0:24:54,92 --> 0:24:57,8
Sri Lankan Buddhists believe
that the tooth relic


375
0:24:57,8 --> 0:25:1,64
was brought to their country
around 300 BC.


376
0:25:1,64 --> 0:25:4,96
Safeguarding the relic
became the responsibility of kings


377
0:25:4,96 --> 0:25:8,44
and over the years,
the custodianship of the relic


378
0:25:8,44 --> 0:25:15,72
came to symbolize the right to rule.


379
0:25:15,72 --> 0:25:20,16
The Buddha is said to have given two
legacies to future generations -


380
0:25:20,16 --> 0:25:23,4
the body of his teachings,
the Dharma,


381
0:25:23,4 --> 0:25:27,28
and also relics of his physical
body itself,


382
0:25:27,28 --> 0:25:31,12
which are now scattered
in shrines right across the globe,


383
0:25:31,12 --> 0:25:40,8
and one of the most precious is kept
in here, in the Temple of the Tooth.


384
0:25:40,8 --> 0:25:44,28
That relic makes the presence of
the Buddha more graphic to people,


385
0:25:44,28 --> 0:25:45,76
so it gives them a power.


386
0:25:45,76 --> 0:25:49,6
Actually, many Buddhist temples
around the world have relics,


387
0:25:49,6 --> 0:25:52,8
a piece of bone or something,


388
0:25:52,8 --> 0:25:54,28
just as in Europe,
you have relics of saints,


389
0:25:54,28 --> 0:25:58,4
so it's a way of making the person's
presence feel more immediate.


390
0:25:58,4 --> 0:26:4,68
That gives the temple more power,
as a magnet to draw the worshipper.


391
0:26:4,68 --> 0:26:8,72
The shrine stands right at the
centre of a paved courtyard.


392
0:26:8,72 --> 0:26:16,52
The ceiling is decorated with
moonstones and floral designs.


393
0:26:16,52 --> 0:26:21,48
There are ivory reliefs
on the doorways.


394
0:26:21,48 --> 0:26:27,36
The inner chamber contains the
tooth relic and other sacred objects


395
0:26:27,36 --> 0:26:42,64
and all around there is
a brightly painted corridor.


396
0:26:42,64 --> 0:26:50,76
DRUMMING AND WIND INSTRUMENT


397
0:26:50,76 --> 0:26:55,52
Monks conduct daily worship
in the inner chamber of the temple.


398
0:26:55,52 --> 0:27:2,52
Rituals are performed at dawn,
at noon and in the evening.


399
0:27:2,52 --> 0:27:6,0
The tooth is in this upper chamber
in a casket of gold


400
0:27:6,0 --> 0:27:11,4
and is only revealed
to a chosen few.


401
0:27:11,4 --> 0:27:13,72
The sacred relic
is symbolically bathed


402
0:27:13,72 --> 0:27:20,8
with an herbal preparation made from
scented water and fragrant flowers.


403
0:27:20,8 --> 0:27:23,92
This holy water is believed
to contain healing properties


404
0:27:23,92 --> 0:27:30,36
and is distributed
among those present.


405
0:27:30,36 --> 0:27:36,32
Once a week, mothers gather
at the temple with their babies.


406
0:27:36,32 --> 0:27:40,76
All these little babies
are waiting to be taken in to
be blessed by the priests


407
0:27:40,76 --> 0:27:44,6
so that they have
Buddha's power with them
for the rest of their lives.


408
0:27:44,6 --> 0:27:48,8
They're given a white piece of
string to wrap around their wrist


409
0:27:48,8 --> 0:27:51,52
which shows that the Buddha is
with them from now until they die.


410
0:27:51,52 --> 0:27:55,84
It's thought incredibly important
that they get the blessing
at this early stage


411
0:27:55,84 --> 0:27:59,4
because everything
that they do from now on,


412
0:27:59,4 --> 0:28:1,4
all their intentional actions,


413
0:28:1,4 --> 0:28:4,72
what they think, what they say
and what they do, their karma,


414
0:28:4,72 --> 0:28:9,16
will affect how they are then
reborn in the next life.


415
0:28:9,16 --> 0:28:13,68
Karma is one of the main concepts
of Buddhism.


416
0:28:13,68 --> 0:28:17,68
It is the belief that
any of our intentional actions,
both thought and deed,


417
0:28:17,68 --> 0:28:21,52
will be mirrored by something
similar happening to us in future.


418
0:28:21,52 --> 0:28:26,0
So, if you harm someone,
someone will harm you.


419
0:28:26,0 --> 0:28:29,72
This principle of cause
and effect can bring consequences


420
0:28:29,72 --> 0:28:33,16
that are either good or bad
depending on what it is you've done.


421
0:28:33,16 --> 0:28:38,2
Because Buddhists believe we have
many lives, this good and bad karma


422
0:28:38,2 --> 0:28:45,48
can generate consequences
both throughout this life
and long into the next.


423
0:28:45,48 --> 0:28:52,2
Karma is what you do. The word
literally means deed or action.


424
0:28:52,2 --> 0:28:53,64
But the Buddha said


425
0:28:53,64 --> 0:28:55,92
that all Karma that matters


426
0:28:55,92 --> 0:28:59,92
is what is morally good
or morally bad,


427
0:28:59,92 --> 0:29:3,88
and you decide what to do.


428
0:29:3,88 --> 0:29:7,64
Now, we must remember
that for Buddhists,


429
0:29:7,64 --> 0:29:12,0
your life goes on beyond what
we normally think of as this life.


430
0:29:12,0 --> 0:29:17,6
In fact, you are reborn
an infinite number of times


431
0:29:17,6 --> 0:29:24,52
until you manage
to bring that to an end.


432
0:29:24,52 --> 0:29:28,2
Buddhists use a metaphor
to help explain what karma is.


433
0:29:28,2 --> 0:29:30,64
They say that
if you sow thistle seed,


434
0:29:30,64 --> 0:29:33,84
then you can't expect
apple trees to grow,


435
0:29:33,84 --> 0:29:38,96
and that is very clear. It's a basic
principle of cause and effect


436
0:29:38,96 --> 0:29:43,8
and as a historian, I know that
that principle has real validity.


437
0:29:43,8 --> 0:29:46,44
We are all affected by our past


438
0:29:46,44 --> 0:29:50,72
and our past and our present
together informs our future


439
0:29:50,72 --> 0:29:52,4
so when the Buddha said


440
0:29:52,4 --> 0:29:57,4
that we should be mindful of our
intentional actions, of our karma


441
0:29:57,4 --> 0:30:0,48
and that our highest authority
is our conscience,


442
0:30:0,48 --> 0:30:2,76
than he was making real sense


443
0:30:2,76 --> 0:30:13,48
and he was also clarifying something
about what it is to be human.


444
0:30:13,48 --> 0:30:18,36
Of course, the issue is that
karma can be both good and bad.


445
0:30:18,36 --> 0:30:21,8
And in Sri Lanka, the fallout
of action and reaction,


446
0:30:21,8 --> 0:30:26,72
of cause and effect, has been
brutally tested in recent years.


447
0:30:26,72 --> 0:30:28,56
For nearly three decades,


448
0:30:28,56 --> 0:30:32,24
the country has been locked
in a violent civil war,


449
0:30:32,24 --> 0:30:36,88
in which close on 100,000 people
have been killed.


450
0:30:36,88 --> 0:30:40,72
Sri Lanka is only now emerging
from this debilitating conflict


451
0:30:40,72 --> 0:30:46,4
between the Hindu Tamil minority
and a Buddhist Singhalese majority.


452
0:30:46,4 --> 0:30:48,68
The Temple of the Tooth
was badly hit


453
0:30:48,68 --> 0:30:51,2
and partially destroyed
during the war.


454
0:30:51,2 --> 0:30:54,52
It has now been fully restored.


455
0:30:54,52 --> 0:31:0,0
Buddhists believe this cycle of
death and destruction can be broken.


456
0:31:0,0 --> 0:31:3,92
They assert that by following
a certain path, it is possible


457
0:31:3,92 --> 0:31:8,56
to break out of a continuous
round of life and death and rebirth,


458
0:31:8,56 --> 0:31:11,0
which in Buddhism has a name.


459
0:31:11,0 --> 0:31:12,6
Samsara.


460
0:31:12,6 --> 0:31:16,4
And Samsara is the concept
I am going to investigate now


461
0:31:16,4 --> 0:31:27,8
as I move to the next wonder
of the Buddhist world.


462
0:31:27,8 --> 0:31:30,48
Once Buddhist ideas
had flourished in Sri Lanka,


463
0:31:30,48 --> 0:31:33,88
Sri Lankan monarchs sent emissaries
to adjoining kingdoms


464
0:31:33,88 --> 0:31:36,36
in southeast Asia to carry


465
0:31:36,36 --> 0:31:38,16
the Buddhist message.


466
0:31:38,16 --> 0:31:39,52
By the 11th century,


467
0:31:39,52 --> 0:31:43,2
Theravadin Buddhism was
well established in Thailand


468
0:31:43,2 --> 0:31:48,16
and here in Bangkok, close on
90% of Thais are now Buddhist.


469
0:31:48,16 --> 0:31:51,68
The reason that Buddhism
has thrived so vigorously


470
0:31:51,68 --> 0:31:56,12
and tenaciously here is because
right from its very outset,


471
0:31:56,12 --> 0:31:59,4
it's had the support
of the Thai kings.


472
0:31:59,4 --> 0:32:2,68
A king here can aspire
to be a Buddha himself


473
0:32:2,68 --> 0:32:5,84
and there is one king who was
actually a monk for 25 years


474
0:32:5,84 --> 0:32:8,28
before he came to the throne.


475
0:32:8,28 --> 0:32:11,68
Every time the royal family
builds a new palace for itself,


476
0:32:11,68 --> 0:32:15,56
it will also constructs next door
a monastery and a temple complex


477
0:32:15,56 --> 0:32:18,4
as a kind of outward sign of its
righteousness


478
0:32:18,4 --> 0:32:21,4
and commitment to the Buddhist cause


479
0:32:21,4 --> 0:32:29,6
and here in Bangkok, the temple
complex is certainly fit for a king.


480
0:32:29,6 --> 0:32:34,24
This is Wat Pho, our next wonder
of the Buddhist world.


481
0:32:34,24 --> 0:32:39,4
It's the largest and oldest
temple complex in Bangkok.


482
0:32:39,4 --> 0:32:43,4
It's home to more than
1,000 Buddha images.


483
0:32:43,4 --> 0:32:46,44
The complex includes a temple,
a working monastery


484
0:32:46,44 --> 0:32:49,6
and a large courtyard
with a forest of stupas,


485
0:32:49,6 --> 0:32:55,76
thick with exquisite
hand-made lotus motifs.


486
0:32:55,76 --> 0:32:59,24
And hidden within its own
palatial hall...


487
0:32:59,24 --> 0:33:10,6
the golden reclining Buddha.


488
0:33:10,6 --> 0:33:13,8
The gold Buddha is 141ft long


489
0:33:13,8 --> 0:33:17,28
and 49ft high.


490
0:33:17,28 --> 0:33:35,88
Started in 1788,
it took over five years to build.


491
0:33:35,88 --> 0:33:39,44
This one of the most
stunning, gobsmacking


492
0:33:39,44 --> 0:33:41,88
works of monumental art
I have ever seen.


493
0:33:41,88 --> 0:33:45,16
I have to say I love its audacity,


494
0:33:45,16 --> 0:33:46,96
I love the fact that it says,


495
0:33:46,96 --> 0:33:49,2
"Look at me, look at what
mankind can do


496
0:33:49,2 --> 0:33:53,24
"when he manipulates raw materials
to create a thing of beauty,"


497
0:33:53,24 --> 0:33:56,88
because here there are thousands
of fragments of mother-of-pearl used


498
0:33:56,88 --> 0:34:0,96
and a 153 plates of gold,


499
0:34:0,96 --> 0:34:4,16
but what it doesn't seem
to me to say


500
0:34:4,16 --> 0:34:8,32
is that this is an incarnation
of the Middle Path,


501
0:34:8,32 --> 0:34:12,32
that essential Buddhist notion that
extremes and excesses


502
0:34:12,32 --> 0:34:14,96
should be avoided at all costs


503
0:34:14,96 --> 0:34:18,2
because there is no doubt that
this is a thing of opulence.


504
0:34:18,2 --> 0:34:21,28
It's enormous, it's gorgeous


505
0:34:21,28 --> 0:34:26,16
and it's very sensuous.


506
0:34:26,16 --> 0:34:31,24
In history of Thailand
there are a lot of large-scale


507
0:34:31,24 --> 0:34:37,2
reclining Buddhas built all
over central part of Thailand,


508
0:34:37,2 --> 0:34:44,4
because to build a reclining Buddha,
it's not a very easy process


509
0:34:44,4 --> 0:34:50,24
because most of the reclining Buddha
is not made from casting


510
0:34:50,24 --> 0:34:55,4
it's made from bricks,
plaster, or cement.


511
0:34:55,4 --> 0:34:59,76
It's considered
very respectful image,


512
0:34:59,76 --> 0:35:5,56
so it must be decorated with
very valuable materials


513
0:35:5,56 --> 0:35:9,8
and, of course, the most
valuable materials


514
0:35:9,8 --> 0:35:15,32
for decorating the image
of Lord Buddha should be gold.


515
0:35:15,32 --> 0:35:19,0
Gold in Buddhism symbolizes
the sun, or fire.


516
0:35:19,0 --> 0:35:22,96
The most valuable of metals,
it is accorded a sacred status


517
0:35:22,96 --> 0:35:27,72
through its association with Surya,
the sun god of the Hindu pantheon.


518
0:35:27,72 --> 0:35:31,64
For Buddhists in Thailand,
and other South Asian countries,


519
0:35:31,64 --> 0:35:34,64
gold is an element that
signifies homage.


520
0:35:34,64 --> 0:35:41,32
A gift of gold is the ultimate
demonstration of one's piety.


521
0:35:41,32 --> 0:35:43,56
The meritorious act
of putting gold leaf


522
0:35:43,56 --> 0:35:46,52
on the surface of a Buddha's skin


523
0:35:46,52 --> 0:35:49,64
is to commemorate the living Buddha,


524
0:35:49,64 --> 0:35:53,92
who had a golden-like aura,
a radiance, they believe.


525
0:35:53,92 --> 0:35:57,92
But gold and its association
with wealth and might


526
0:35:57,92 --> 0:36:1,96
is also the way Thai monarchs have
used a showy form of piety


527
0:36:1,96 --> 0:36:5,96
to forge a strong relationship
between Buddha's ideas


528
0:36:5,96 --> 0:36:9,0
and the power of the state.


529
0:36:9,0 --> 0:36:10,48
It was King Rama III


530
0:36:10,48 --> 0:36:13,76
who had the statue of the reclining
Buddha opulently restored


531
0:36:13,76 --> 0:36:18,2
at the height of his reign
in the mid-19th century.


532
0:36:18,2 --> 0:36:19,92
It's called the Lion Pose,


533
0:36:19,92 --> 0:36:25,2
so, as he lay there in the lion
pose as he was preparing to die.


534
0:36:25,2 --> 0:36:28,56
It's described that he lay
down on his right side


535
0:36:28,56 --> 0:36:34,28
and he rested his head
on his right hand.


536
0:36:34,28 --> 0:36:37,72
There is a reason that this Buddha
has got such a serene smile -


537
0:36:37,72 --> 0:36:41,76
it's because he has achieved
enlightenment, Nirvana.


538
0:36:41,76 --> 0:36:46,2
It means that he has escaped what
Buddhists call Samsara,


539
0:36:46,2 --> 0:36:49,88
an endless cycle of life,
of birth and death,


540
0:36:49,88 --> 0:36:53,8
of passion and desire and delusion,


541
0:36:53,8 --> 0:37:1,8
that can only lead
to pain and suffering.


542
0:37:1,8 --> 0:37:6,4
Samsara effectively constitutes
a cycle of birth and re-birth,


543
0:37:6,4 --> 0:37:10,56
and as long as we are in Samsara
we are born innumerable times


544
0:37:10,56 --> 0:37:13,8
and moving from one existence
to the next.


545
0:37:13,8 --> 0:37:16,12
We can be re-born as a human being,
as a divinity,


546
0:37:16,12 --> 0:37:23,36
or you can be re-born
as an animal, etc.


547
0:37:23,36 --> 0:37:25,96
'Tell me what you think Samsara is?'


548
0:37:25,96 --> 0:37:30,28
For me it's not just
a physical picture


549
0:37:30,28 --> 0:37:34,76
of, you know, the circle of being
born and ageing and dying,


550
0:37:34,76 --> 0:37:39,6
for me it has something to do with
the state of mind as well.


551
0:37:39,6 --> 0:37:45,48
That you have to deal with your bad
emotions if you have problems,


552
0:37:45,48 --> 0:37:48,6
if you're suffering, you have...
feel frustrated,


553
0:37:48,6 --> 0:37:50,4
you don't know how to deal with it,


554
0:37:50,4 --> 0:37:53,64
but this is just a small sample
of bad things that happen to you,


555
0:37:53,64 --> 0:38:0,6
just keep go on and on and on,
can find a real peace or happiness.


556
0:38:0,6 --> 0:38:4,2
The wheel of life is a common
visual depiction in Buddhism.


557
0:38:4,2 --> 0:38:6,64
At the time Buddha started to teach,


558
0:38:6,64 --> 0:38:9,4
many understood life
as a relentless cycle,


559
0:38:9,4 --> 0:38:14,16
where all were born, grew old, died
and were re-born in another life.


560
0:38:14,16 --> 0:38:19,4
It was an eternal morass,
from which there was no release,


561
0:38:19,4 --> 0:38:22,52
but Buddha felt that
an escape was possible.


562
0:38:22,52 --> 0:38:26,52
He taught that
through one's actions,
karma, and through a way of life


563
0:38:26,52 --> 0:38:30,44
that was characterized by wisdom,
morality and compassion,


564
0:38:30,44 --> 0:38:34,72
via meditation and the triumph
of the mind over craving,
desire and excess,


565
0:38:34,72 --> 0:38:41,96
it was possible to achieve
enlightenment, Nirvana.


566
0:38:41,96 --> 0:38:45,56
He believed that this enlightenment
would empower ordinary people


567
0:38:45,56 --> 0:38:48,0
to break free from Samsara.


568
0:38:48,0 --> 0:38:50,32
THEY CHANT


569
0:38:50,32 --> 0:38:53,76
This idea gives Buddhist funerals
a distinctive character.


570
0:38:53,76 --> 0:38:57,4
Those present mourn their loss,


571
0:38:57,4 --> 0:39:0,68
but also hope that, thanks to their
beloved's good karma,


572
0:39:0,68 --> 0:39:4,92
the dead are at least one step
closer to enlightenment,


573
0:39:4,92 --> 0:39:8,6
that they have the chance of
a re-birth as a better being


574
0:39:8,6 --> 0:39:15,8
who one day can escape Samsara.


575
0:39:15,8 --> 0:39:18,28
What goes around comes around,
and that's what I believe,


576
0:39:18,28 --> 0:39:22,16
this body is just like a house that
we rent for a while.


577
0:39:22,16 --> 0:39:26,8
After we die we have to find a new
place to live,


578
0:39:26,8 --> 0:39:28,72
it's impermanent,
it's just temporary.


579
0:39:28,72 --> 0:39:32,76
So, good Buddhists believe that we
should do our best in this life


580
0:39:32,76 --> 0:39:54,28
to guarantee a better place
after we die.


581
0:39:54,28 --> 0:39:57,92
Buddhists say that there
is only one certain way


582
0:39:57,92 --> 0:40:0,24
to break free from Samsara,


583
0:40:0,24 --> 0:40:3,44
to eliminate the desires,
and the passions,


584
0:40:3,44 --> 0:40:7,28
and the distractions
of everyday life.


585
0:40:7,28 --> 0:40:11,36
Now, of course, that is very easy
to say and it's very hard to do,


586
0:40:11,36 --> 0:40:16,16
so over the centuries Buddhists have
employed specific rigorous methods


587
0:40:16,16 --> 0:40:18,68
to break free from all of this,


588
0:40:18,68 --> 0:40:21,72
from the troubles and the
temptations of the real world,


589
0:40:21,72 --> 0:40:26,24
and to set themselves on the path
to enlightenment, to Nirvana,


590
0:40:26,24 --> 0:40:31,4
and that is the truly radical thing
about the Buddha's example,


591
0:40:31,4 --> 0:40:34,4
his belief that each
and every one of us


592
0:40:34,4 --> 0:40:37,68
has the capacity
to achieve liberation,


593
0:40:37,68 --> 0:40:43,88
to achieve our own enlightenment.


594
0:40:43,88 --> 0:40:47,96
It took the Buddha years to arrive
at this radical belief.


595
0:40:47,96 --> 0:40:51,36
Ideas he developed through his own
personal experience -


596
0:40:51,36 --> 0:40:55,8
in particular, an intense
form of meditation.


597
0:40:55,8 --> 0:40:59,48
And it is Buddhist meditation
that I'm now going to experience


598
0:40:59,48 --> 0:41:4,56
in our next wonder
of the Buddhist world.


599
0:41:4,56 --> 0:41:7,8
Buddhism continued to spread
throughout the Mediaeval period.


600
0:41:7,8 --> 0:41:8,96
Come the 13th century


601
0:41:8,96 --> 0:41:12,48
and Buddhism was flourishing
in the Khmer Kingdom...


602
0:41:12,48 --> 0:41:15,76
modern-day Cambodia.


603
0:41:15,76 --> 0:41:22,24
The temple complexes here at Angkor
are our fifth wonder.


604
0:41:22,24 --> 0:41:25,52
Angkor Wat began life
as the sacred palace complex


605
0:41:25,52 --> 0:41:28,96
of a Khmer Emperor who,
in fact, favoured Hinduism


606
0:41:28,96 --> 0:41:32,2
over Buddhist ideas.


607
0:41:32,2 --> 0:41:37,28
These aren't just buildings,
but have a grand ambition.


608
0:41:37,28 --> 0:41:40,96
The whole complex is said to be
a symbolic representation


609
0:41:40,96 --> 0:41:48,64
of Hindu cosmology.


610
0:41:48,64 --> 0:41:52,12
The original temple honoured
the Hindu god Vishnu


611
0:41:52,12 --> 0:41:56,56
and incarnates the centre of the
physical and spiritual universe,


612
0:41:56,56 --> 0:42:1,28
a mythical mountain.


613
0:42:1,28 --> 0:42:5,8
A series of five rectangular walls
represent other mountains


614
0:42:5,8 --> 0:42:20,56
and the moats here evoke
the cosmic ocean.


615
0:42:20,56 --> 0:42:27,44
This place reeks of a combination
of earthly and divine power,


616
0:42:27,44 --> 0:42:32,16
and of the close-knit relationship
between gods and kings.


617
0:42:32,16 --> 0:42:34,76
And, of course, it was a belief
in that relationship


618
0:42:34,76 --> 0:42:38,84
that inspired the creation of this
complex in the first place,


619
0:42:38,84 --> 0:42:42,48
but for some people it was
just TOO exclusive,


620
0:42:42,48 --> 0:42:45,32
too strictly hierarchical...


621
0:42:45,32 --> 0:42:48,6
and Buddhism offered a solution.


622
0:42:48,6 --> 0:42:54,4
It was the Khmer Emperor Jayavarman
VII who converted to Buddhism


623
0:42:54,4 --> 0:42:56,68
and his regime marked a clear
dividing line


624
0:42:56,68 --> 0:42:59,8
with the old Hindu past.


625
0:42:59,8 --> 0:43:4,52
Before 1200, art in the temples
mostly portrayed scenes from
the Hindu pantheon.


626
0:43:4,52 --> 0:43:10,8
After his conversion, Buddhist
scenes began to appear
as standard motifs.


627
0:43:10,8 --> 0:43:13,76
During his reign, there was a focus
on building libraries,


628
0:43:13,76 --> 0:43:17,8
monastic dwellings, public works,
and more "earthly" projects,


629
0:43:17,8 --> 0:43:20,8
accessible to the common people.


630
0:43:20,8 --> 0:43:24,36
So history in Cambodia
takes a humanist turn


631
0:43:24,36 --> 0:43:27,4
and as Buddhism rises in popularity,


632
0:43:27,4 --> 0:43:32,44
you find images of the Buddha and
his followers emerging everywhere
in the architecture...


633
0:43:32,44 --> 0:43:36,48
in gates, in walls and in temples.


634
0:43:36,48 --> 0:43:43,36
So now Angkor is showing
the world a more human face.


635
0:43:43,36 --> 0:43:49,48
The Angkor complex is a prime
example of the classical style
of Khmer architecture.


636
0:43:49,48 --> 0:43:50,84
By the 12th century,


637
0:43:50,84 --> 0:43:54,56
Khmer architects had become skilled
and confident in masonry,


638
0:43:54,56 --> 0:43:59,84
facing the monuments with intricate
sandstone blocks.


639
0:43:59,84 --> 0:44:4,32
Angkor Wat is famous for the harmony
of its world-class design.


640
0:44:4,32 --> 0:44:10,8
Architecturally, towers shaped
like lotus buds are characteristic.


641
0:44:10,8 --> 0:44:12,68
Half-galleries broaden
the passageways,


642
0:44:12,68 --> 0:44:15,68
other galleries connect enclosures


643
0:44:15,68 --> 0:44:19,96
and terraces appear along the main
pathways of the temple.


644
0:44:19,96 --> 0:44:22,8
The walls are decorated
with bas-reliefs


645
0:44:22,8 --> 0:44:29,4
showing Hindu mythological figures
and detailed narrative scenes.


646
0:44:29,4 --> 0:44:35,48
This one depicts the churning
of the oceans.


647
0:44:35,48 --> 0:44:38,56
Other elements of the design have
been destroyed by looting


648
0:44:38,56 --> 0:44:40,76
and the passage of time.


649
0:44:40,76 --> 0:44:45,8
They included gilded stucco,
gold on some figures,


650
0:44:45,8 --> 0:44:49,28
and elaborate carved ceiling
panels and doors.


651
0:44:49,28 --> 0:44:53,24
This was the largest sacred
building in the world.


652
0:44:53,24 --> 0:44:58,44
Although there is an eerie,
crumbling beauty to this place now,


653
0:44:58,44 --> 0:45:2,32
you have to imagine
it in its heyday.


654
0:45:2,32 --> 0:45:5,52
All this stonework would have
been brightly painted


655
0:45:5,52 --> 0:45:9,72
and in this corridor there would
have been many hundreds of
statues of the Buddha,


656
0:45:9,72 --> 0:45:12,24
wrought out of precious gold.


657
0:45:12,24 --> 0:45:16,16
The light from the statues would
have been reflected back
from the walls,


658
0:45:16,16 --> 0:45:21,28
which would have been studded with
emeralds and sapphires and rubies,


659
0:45:21,28 --> 0:45:24,92
and outside there would have
been crowds of monks,


660
0:45:24,92 --> 0:45:27,6
their eyes closed in meditation,


661
0:45:27,6 --> 0:45:34,92
their faces lit by the glow of
torches made out of jungle resin.


662
0:45:34,92 --> 0:45:38,76
Since Buddhism is primarily
an educational system,


663
0:45:38,76 --> 0:45:43,84
meditation is a key component
of that educational system.


664
0:45:43,84 --> 0:45:47,12
Meditation is the way you become
viscerally and directly aware


665
0:45:47,12 --> 0:45:50,64
of all these deep connections and
connectivenesses to the universe,


666
0:45:50,64 --> 0:45:52,8
and you have to become
directly aware of it


667
0:45:52,8 --> 0:45:57,12
to become free of being controlled
by unconscious processes.


668
0:45:57,12 --> 0:46:2,56
And that freedom is liberation,
that freedom is Nirvana.


669
0:46:2,56 --> 0:46:5,24
I'd been invited by a group
of trainee Buddhist monks


670
0:46:5,24 --> 0:46:9,88
to experience meditation for myself.


671
0:46:9,88 --> 0:46:15,4
Members of the Sangha can spend
hours each day meditating.


672
0:46:15,4 --> 0:46:18,76
The way they sit, the position
of their hands,


673
0:46:18,76 --> 0:46:22,84
is copied from the practice
of the Buddha himself.


674
0:46:22,84 --> 0:46:26,76
They are still and concentrate
on their breathing...


675
0:46:26,76 --> 0:46:29,6
not doing anything to alter
the way they breathe,


676
0:46:29,6 --> 0:46:33,6
not worrying about whether
they're doing it right or wrong,


677
0:46:33,6 --> 0:46:38,48
clearing their minds of thoughts,
of feelings, of fear and anger...


678
0:46:38,48 --> 0:46:41,48
of the distractions
of the outside world.


679
0:46:41,48 --> 0:46:52,44
Just following the breathing
and becoming one with each breath.


680
0:46:52,44 --> 0:46:57,16
I can't say I've managed to
completely block out the
sound of the world going on


681
0:46:57,16 --> 0:47:1,28
and it feels hard to stay
this still for so long,


682
0:47:1,28 --> 0:47:8,36
but if someone were to ask me if
I had any anger in my head
or my heart right now,


683
0:47:8,36 --> 0:47:20,52
I would have to say there is none.


684
0:47:20,52 --> 0:47:25,84
The Pali Canon advises that
there are particularly good
places to meditate -


685
0:47:25,84 --> 0:47:30,68
a mountain, a hillside,
a rock cave, a cemetery,


686
0:47:30,68 --> 0:47:33,8
an open field, an open forest,


687
0:47:33,8 --> 0:47:35,72
the root of a tree,


688
0:47:35,72 --> 0:47:37,8
deep in the jungle.


689
0:47:37,8 --> 0:47:40,84
And this place certainly fits
some of those criteria,


690
0:47:40,84 --> 0:47:42,12
but I have to say,


691
0:47:42,12 --> 0:47:46,56
I'm probably going to carry on
meditating in my own sweet
way for a while.


692
0:47:46,56 --> 0:47:49,2
I am not quite ready yet
to do the deep breathing


693
0:47:49,2 --> 0:47:51,4
and the lotus position.


694
0:47:51,4 --> 0:47:55,48
But still I have huge respect
for the practice of meditation,


695
0:47:55,48 --> 0:47:58,72
not least because it is
a firm vote of confidence


696
0:47:58,72 --> 0:48:1,76
in the power of the human mind.


697
0:48:1,76 --> 0:48:5,84
It suggests that in order to
transcend the difficulties
of this world,


698
0:48:5,84 --> 0:48:10,72
we don't just need to appeal
to a higher, divine authority...


699
0:48:10,72 --> 0:48:15,84
but to look to our own
consciousness.


700
0:48:15,84 --> 0:48:20,32
Well, certainly the people of
Cambodia have had more
cause than most


701
0:48:20,32 --> 0:48:25,84
to find internal resources to deal
with the troubles that the world
has thrown at them.


702
0:48:25,84 --> 0:48:32,28
Cambodia has suffered some of the
worst violence and genocide
of the last century.


703
0:48:32,28 --> 0:48:36,72
Between 1968 and 1976, over 3
million Cambodians were killed


704
0:48:36,72 --> 0:48:42,56
in the war that engulfed Vietnam and
other countries of southeast Asia.


705
0:48:42,56 --> 0:48:45,68
This was then followed
by the terror and genocide


706
0:48:45,68 --> 0:48:47,6
unleashed by the Khmer Rouge,


707
0:48:47,6 --> 0:48:55,2
a communist movement that ruled
Cambodia for four years.


708
0:48:55,2 --> 0:48:59,16
The Khmer Rouge dealt particularly
viciously with Buddhism.


709
0:48:59,16 --> 0:49:3,76
Thousands of monks were slaughtered
and monasteries were destroyed


710
0:49:3,76 --> 0:49:5,96
and if people tried to hold
on to their beliefs,


711
0:49:5,96 --> 0:49:9,56
they were often tortured and killed.


712
0:49:9,56 --> 0:49:13,68
But gradually, as the nightmare
is beginning to fade,


713
0:49:13,68 --> 0:49:17,4
Buddhism is finding its feet here
again and when you come to Angkor,


714
0:49:17,4 --> 0:49:24,8
you'll find little active shrines
like this tucked away into corners.


715
0:49:24,8 --> 0:49:28,92
In Cambodia, Buddhism is slowly
reasserting itself.


716
0:49:28,92 --> 0:49:33,84
This country, which had experienced
such horrors, is now peaceful


717
0:49:33,84 --> 0:49:36,24
and Angkor, which had
been brutalized


718
0:49:36,24 --> 0:49:38,0
by the Khmer Rouge regime,


719
0:49:38,0 --> 0:49:41,72
is now a world tourist
site once again.


720
0:49:41,72 --> 0:49:44,56
It's been very moving
coming here to Cambodia


721
0:49:44,56 --> 0:49:47,36
because this place has been the home


722
0:49:47,36 --> 0:49:52,44
to the most dramatic twists and
turns in the fortunes of Buddhism.


723
0:49:52,44 --> 0:49:55,64
For centuries, Buddhism was
the philosophy of choice,


724
0:49:55,64 --> 0:49:58,32
for both the kings and the people,


725
0:49:58,32 --> 0:50:1,48
and then thanks to the horrors
of the Khmer Rouge,


726
0:50:1,48 --> 0:50:4,44
there was a chance that it was
going to be eradicated


727
0:50:4,44 --> 0:50:6,96
virtually overnight.


728
0:50:6,96 --> 0:50:11,36
But gradually, gently,
it is now making a comeback


729
0:50:11,36 --> 0:50:14,6
and there's even a possibility
that this place,


730
0:50:14,6 --> 0:50:20,2
which was once the biggest and most
active Buddhist complex
in the world,


731
0:50:20,2 --> 0:50:27,84
could be that again,
some time in the future.


732
0:50:27,84 --> 0:50:33,52
While in Cambodia Buddhism
is emerging out of the darkness
of the Khmer Rouge regime,


733
0:50:33,52 --> 0:50:36,76
Buddhism in mainland China,
and here in Hong Kong,


734
0:50:36,76 --> 0:50:39,88
is also reasserting itself,


735
0:50:39,88 --> 0:50:45,4
an ancient tradition
reappearing in modern society.


736
0:50:45,4 --> 0:50:47,36
Buddhism is on the rise once again,


737
0:50:47,36 --> 0:50:54,64
partly perhaps because its positive
attitude feels well-suited
to an emerging superpower.


738
0:50:54,64 --> 0:50:57,52
Particularly popular
is the Zen form of Buddhism.


739
0:50:57,52 --> 0:51:0,52
Little surprise given that Zen,


740
0:51:0,52 --> 0:51:4,4
although now typically
associated with Japan,


741
0:51:4,4 --> 0:51:6,64
started off life in China.


742
0:51:6,64 --> 0:51:8,44
And I'm going to explore Zen


743
0:51:8,44 --> 0:51:13,48
in one of the places in the world
where it is most vigorous...


744
0:51:13,48 --> 0:51:15,76
Hong Kong.


745
0:51:15,76 --> 0:51:19,76
Our sixth wonder
is the giant Buddha that overlooks


746
0:51:19,76 --> 0:51:23,64
this great Asian city.


747
0:51:23,64 --> 0:51:27,8
This mammoth bronze statue
was completed in 1993.


748
0:51:27,8 --> 0:51:31,4
It symbolises the relationship
between man and nature,


749
0:51:31,4 --> 0:51:33,64
people and religion.


750
0:51:33,64 --> 0:51:36,4
The building
of the giant Buddha in Hong Kong


751
0:51:36,4 --> 0:51:39,28
was a reassertion
of an old Buddhist tradition


752
0:51:39,28 --> 0:51:42,92
of constructing
massive Buddhist images.


753
0:51:42,92 --> 0:51:47,28
And the monks who initiated
the project in Hong Kong


754
0:51:47,28 --> 0:51:50,92
had visited Japan, and they'd visited
various sites in mainland China


755
0:51:50,92 --> 0:51:54,4
and seen medieval massive images
of Buddhas,


756
0:51:54,4 --> 0:51:58,24
and this was something they
were trying to re-create in Lantan.


757
0:51:58,24 --> 0:52:3,28
It's the only statue of Buddha
to face north towards Beijing,


758
0:52:3,28 --> 0:52:11,0
and is named Tian Tan after
the Temple of Heaven in that city.


759
0:52:11,0 --> 0:52:15,92
When Buddhism first starts out,
it seems that people actively


760
0:52:15,92 --> 0:52:19,48
choose not to represent
the Buddha figuratively.


761
0:52:19,48 --> 0:52:23,84
But then as the philosophy passes
through regions like Afghanistan,


762
0:52:23,84 --> 0:52:26,2
which had a really
strong Greek influence


763
0:52:26,2 --> 0:52:29,8
thanks to the invasion
of Alexander the Great,


764
0:52:29,8 --> 0:52:34,44
it becomes the done thing to
represent the Buddha in human form.


765
0:52:34,44 --> 0:52:37,92
Now, once the belief system
enters China,


766
0:52:37,92 --> 0:52:40,68
a new tradition gains popularity.


767
0:52:40,68 --> 0:52:44,8
Not just to represent
the Buddha in human form,


768
0:52:44,8 --> 0:52:48,28
but to do so on a monumental scale.


769
0:52:48,28 --> 0:53:0,16
And that's an art form that's now
being revived here in Hong Kong.


770
0:53:0,16 --> 0:53:3,28
Everything about this statue
means something.


771
0:53:3,28 --> 0:53:5,72
The Buddha is sitting
in a lotus position,


772
0:53:5,72 --> 0:53:9,96
which shows that he was like
the beauty of a lotus flower


773
0:53:9,96 --> 0:53:13,68
emerging from the muddy waters
of a pond.


774
0:53:13,68 --> 0:53:18,4
His face is that beautiful
round shape, which is supposed
to be a reflection


775
0:53:18,4 --> 0:53:20,6
of the perfection of the moon.


776
0:53:20,6 --> 0:53:24,76
And his head is domed,
which tells us just how wise he is.


777
0:53:24,76 --> 0:53:26,4
His hands are interesting


778
0:53:26,4 --> 0:53:29,92
because the right hand
is raised in a gesture of blessing.


779
0:53:29,92 --> 0:53:35,0
This is the Buddha's vow
that he will release the entire
world from its suffering.


780
0:53:35,0 --> 0:53:39,4
And on his chest he's got
that so-called Swastika symbol.


781
0:53:39,4 --> 0:53:43,24
Of course the Swastika
was unfortunately appropriated
by the Nazis,


782
0:53:43,24 --> 0:53:45,56
even though they got it
the wrong way round.


783
0:53:45,56 --> 0:53:50,16
But what it actually means
is the power of the universe,


784
0:53:50,16 --> 0:53:53,72
so this tells us that the Buddha's
compassion and wisdom


785
0:53:53,72 --> 0:54:0,12
is available to all.


786
0:54:0,12 --> 0:54:4,56
The Buddha statue sits
on a lotus throne


787
0:54:4,56 --> 0:54:7,8
on top of an altar.


788
0:54:7,8 --> 0:54:10,24
It's surrounded
by six smaller bronze statues.


789
0:54:10,24 --> 0:54:13,68
They're shown offering gifts
like fruit and incense,


790
0:54:13,68 --> 0:54:17,0
gifts that symbolise different
aspects of Buddhist philosophy,


791
0:54:17,0 --> 0:54:31,12
all virtues which are necessary
to achieve enlightenment.


792
0:54:31,12 --> 0:54:35,24
The giant Buddha is part of the
Po Lin monastery and temple complex


793
0:54:35,24 --> 0:54:40,32
set up nearly 100 years ago
by three Zen masters.


794
0:54:40,32 --> 0:54:45,0
Zen has developed as a part
of Mahayana Buddhism,


795
0:54:45,0 --> 0:54:47,4
the school of Buddhism
practised in China


796
0:54:47,4 --> 0:54:49,56
and other northern Asian countries.


797
0:54:49,56 --> 0:54:54,56
Zen Buddhists believe that
all people have the qualities
that the Buddha had,


798
0:54:54,56 --> 0:55:11,4
and emphasise that these can be
developed and were not unique
to the Buddha only.


799
0:55:11,4 --> 0:55:15,6
The aim of Zen is to discover
this quality within each person,


800
0:55:15,6 --> 0:55:21,8
through meditation and practice
of the Buddha's teachings.


801
0:55:21,8 --> 0:55:29,88
The ultimate goal is to become
a completely enlightened Buddha.


802
0:55:29,88 --> 0:55:33,68
Meditation has always
been central to Buddhism,


803
0:55:33,68 --> 0:55:37,24
but here in China a new
brand of meditation was born,


804
0:55:37,24 --> 0:55:43,48
and it took its name from
a Sanskrit word Dhyana which
is actually very hard to translate,


805
0:55:43,48 --> 0:55:48,56
but it means a kind of
alert, productive state of mind.


806
0:55:48,56 --> 0:55:49,92
In China it was called Chan


807
0:55:49,92 --> 0:55:56,2
and when it travels to Japan
it becomes Zen.


808
0:55:56,2 --> 0:56:4,16
It's a school of Buddhism which
lays enormous emphasis on certain
kinds of meditative practice.


809
0:56:4,16 --> 0:56:9,88
What you try to do
is purely to empty your mind.


810
0:56:9,88 --> 0:56:19,28
It has an ideology that rational
thought is not going to get
you to enlightenment or Nirvana.


811
0:56:19,28 --> 0:56:26,84
It's practised here
in a small secluded monastery,
minutes away from the giant Buddha.


812
0:56:26,84 --> 0:56:31,24
Formal silent meditation
is central to Zen


813
0:56:31,24 --> 0:56:38,56
and is practised by both the laity
and the ordained together.


814
0:56:38,56 --> 0:56:44,0
Some people find the concept
of Zen quite difficult to grasp.


815
0:56:44,0 --> 0:56:45,28
How would you define it?


816
0:56:45,28 --> 0:56:49,72
So Zen means we never
separate our life and our practice.


817
0:56:49,72 --> 0:56:54,6
Zen is like 24 hours
when you are standing,


818
0:56:54,6 --> 0:57:0,4
sitting, walking, lying down,
so never separate.


819
0:57:0,4 --> 0:57:5,44
You know, our everyday life
and our practice cannot separate,
it's not two things.


820
0:57:5,44 --> 0:57:9,48
Zen also means inside,
inside, you know, our mind,


821
0:57:9,48 --> 0:57:20,68
and outside objects, inside and
outside both become one, that's Zen.


822
0:57:20,68 --> 0:57:25,84
So if you're not making
that separation between
Zen practice and everyday life,


823
0:57:25,84 --> 0:57:29,52
does that mean that when you do
everything, when you sweep the floor


824
0:57:29,52 --> 0:57:36,8
or prepare food or clean something,
that is an act of Zen itself?


825
0:57:36,8 --> 0:57:39,92
Zen means what are you doing now,
you know.


826
0:57:39,92 --> 0:57:43,8
So somebody might get enlightenment
while they are eating meal,


827
0:57:43,8 --> 0:57:50,28
washing bowl, all these were designed
to help people be in the moment


828
0:57:50,28 --> 0:57:55,64
and maybe at that moment
your mind becomes clear
and your life becomes clear.


829
0:57:55,64 --> 0:58:35,92
THUNDER RUMBLES


830
0:58:35,92 --> 0:58:39,36
This is called water bowl meditation


831
0:58:39,36 --> 0:58:42,48
and the purpose is to carry the
water without spilling a drop.


832
0:58:42,48 --> 0:58:45,92
The idea is that you can do this
through the application of Zen,


833
0:58:45,92 --> 0:58:51,72
because if you think
you're carrying a bowl of water,
you're bound to shake and lose some


834
0:58:51,72 --> 0:59:2,56
but if you clear your mind
completely, you will complete
the task successfully.


835
0:59:2,56 --> 0:59:7,24
In the West a lot of people
have heard of Zen. It's something
that is quite popular.


836
0:59:7,24 --> 0:59:11,36
Do you think that's partly because
people's lives are so demanding


837
0:59:11,36 --> 0:59:14,76
and Zen offers a way out from that?


838
0:59:14,76 --> 0:59:19,84
Not only the West are very busy,
now Asia is more busy! It's true!


839
0:59:19,84 --> 0:59:25,92
It's very money-oriented,
everybody worry about the living,


840
0:59:25,92 --> 0:59:30,16
so it's very important
our mind know how to relax


841
0:59:30,16 --> 0:59:33,88
and to be living at this moment
and to keep clear.


842
0:59:33,88 --> 0:59:39,28
If you can live in this present,
even if some problem appear, it's OK.


843
0:59:39,28 --> 0:59:43,36
You have this clear mind
and you are not agitated.


844
0:59:43,36 --> 0:59:56,4
I think these are very important
practice for everybody.


845
0:59:56,4 --> 1:0:2,32
Zen practitioners today
don't like to use specific words
to limit what Zen is,


846
1:0:2,32 --> 1:0:6,96
but if you want to find
a definition for the practice,
probably as close as you'll get


847
1:0:6,96 --> 1:0:11,64
is that this is something
that really believes
in the power of intuition


848
1:0:11,64 --> 1:0:15,0
and in a productive simplicity.


849
1:0:15,0 --> 1:0:20,84
I can see that cherishing
intuition, living for the moment,
living day by day,


850
1:0:20,84 --> 1:0:25,64
with a clear mind, is a very
productive way to spend your time.


851
1:0:25,64 --> 1:0:31,64
Perhaps it explains why
of all brands of Buddhism, Zen
has become particularly attractive


852
1:0:31,64 --> 1:0:46,2
to those who live
in our demanding 21st century.


853
1:0:46,2 --> 1:0:49,24
Zen, and its ancestor Chan,


854
1:0:49,24 --> 1:0:51,64
is a very practical
form of Buddhist wisdom.


855
1:0:51,64 --> 1:0:58,36
It encourages a process
of rediscovery by living simply.


856
1:0:58,36 --> 1:1:5,4
The Zen tradition emphasises
that enlightenment is possible
here and now.


857
1:1:5,4 --> 1:1:9,92
Is it then very different
from other forms of Buddhism?


858
1:1:9,92 --> 1:1:16,92
Zen means pointing directly to our
mind, it means right now wake up,


859
1:1:16,92 --> 1:1:18,92
and be clear,
what are you doing now.


860
1:1:18,92 --> 1:1:21,72
Actually, our mind is not
complicated.


861
1:1:21,72 --> 1:1:25,88
It is our thinking with our life
that is very complicated.


862
1:1:25,88 --> 1:1:34,92
So Zen is a tool to help us
to bring back our mind
to our everyday life and be simple.


863
1:1:34,92 --> 1:1:42,28
Zen, like all Buddhist practice,
turns philosophy into a tool
to help in day-to-day life.


864
1:1:42,28 --> 1:1:45,28
Meditation is also used
to bring about a tangible outcome,


865
1:1:45,28 --> 1:1:49,32
either in the understanding
of the world or in our ability
to deal with it,


866
1:1:49,32 --> 1:1:53,6
and with the suffering we
see all around and feel within us.


867
1:1:53,6 --> 1:1:57,84
One thing that struck me
was that whatever the regional
variations of Buddhism,


868
1:1:57,84 --> 1:2:3,2
issues of suffering are right
at the core of the philosophy.


869
1:2:3,2 --> 1:2:7,76
Now that is really interesting
because in general
over the last 2,500 years


870
1:2:7,76 --> 1:2:11,84
the cultures of the East have been
very unabashed about suffering,


871
1:2:11,84 --> 1:2:14,72
they don't mind putting
it centre stage.


872
1:2:14,72 --> 1:2:19,8
Whereas in the West, these are
issues that we can sometimes
try to brush under the carpet.


873
1:2:19,8 --> 1:2:25,68
In the modern age, for instance,
we've been accused of trying
to cheat death itself.


874
1:2:25,68 --> 1:2:28,52
But just look at that statue,


875
1:2:28,52 --> 1:2:32,36
there's the Buddha promising to deal
with all the suffering in the world.


876
1:2:32,36 --> 1:2:37,96
So it does make you wonder
what future Buddhism
has as a global belief system.


877
1:2:37,96 --> 1:2:40,56
What's going to happen
when ideas of the East,


878
1:2:40,56 --> 1:2:54,12
which put suffering to the fore,
start to take root in the West?


879
1:2:54,12 --> 1:2:57,96
Buddhist ideas and philosophy
have become increasingly popular


880
1:2:57,96 --> 1:3:4,8
in the fast-paced and highly
competitive world of California.


881
1:3:4,8 --> 1:3:8,4
New Age concepts mixed
with the counterculture
of the hippies in the 1970s


882
1:3:8,4 --> 1:3:14,24
have made words like Karma
and Nirvana commonplace.


883
1:3:14,24 --> 1:3:20,2
Buddhism offered a spiritual life
and an emphasis on morality
without being too authoritarian.


884
1:3:20,2 --> 1:3:25,12
Buddhism initially spread
into the West and especially
the West Coast of the United States


885
1:3:25,12 --> 1:3:31,12
in the 19th century, thanks
to Japanese and Chinese labourers
brought in to work on the railways.


886
1:3:31,12 --> 1:3:37,0
In Los Angeles, the first
Buddhist temples were set up
at the turn of the century.


887
1:3:37,0 --> 1:3:38,4
Today, the city is home


888
1:3:38,4 --> 1:3:41,4
to one of the largest
Buddhist temples in the West.


889
1:3:41,4 --> 1:3:45,16
Hsi Lai Temple at Hacienda Heights,


890
1:3:45,16 --> 1:3:52,68
our seventh wonder
of the Buddhist world.


891
1:3:52,68 --> 1:3:58,28
Here I am going to try
to understand what has to be
the most important Buddhist concept,


892
1:3:58,28 --> 1:4:8,4
the ultimate goal
for Buddhists, Nirvana.


893
1:4:8,4 --> 1:4:10,96
The planning and construction
of the temple in the 1980s


894
1:4:10,96 --> 1:4:15,92
was met with suspicion and
resistance from local communities.


895
1:4:15,92 --> 1:4:20,56
The building of the temple
at its current location survived
six public hearings


896
1:4:20,56 --> 1:4:23,28
and 165 explanatory sessions.


897
1:4:23,28 --> 1:4:28,56
Finally, in 1985, the temple
was granted a building permit.


898
1:4:28,56 --> 1:4:34,84
It was completed in 1988.


899
1:4:34,84 --> 1:4:39,0
I tell you what there
is definitely a wealth of here,
and that is Buddhas.


900
1:4:39,0 --> 1:4:43,6
I have never seen so many.
There must be 10,000 or something.


901
1:4:43,6 --> 1:4:46,84
Yeah, there are over 10,000
Buddhas here, big and small.


902
1:4:46,84 --> 1:4:51,8
And if you look at all the Buddhas,
you may find some names there.


903
1:4:51,8 --> 1:4:55,52
It's a Chinese practice
that people make an offering


904
1:4:55,52 --> 1:4:59,24
and then to have the name
of the family. It's their Buddha.


905
1:4:59,24 --> 1:5:2,32
And it's also a form of supporting
the temple,


906
1:5:2,32 --> 1:5:5,56
they come in and say
"I have a Buddha in there".


907
1:5:5,56 --> 1:5:11,12
It's like the connection
between the Buddha outside
and the Buddha inside.


908
1:5:11,12 --> 1:5:15,4
One of the many American Buddhists
who come to the temple is Mario Cee.


909
1:5:15,4 --> 1:5:21,68
He became a Buddhist six years ago.


910
1:5:21,68 --> 1:5:25,4
There are some who'd say
that the attraction of Buddhism
for many Americans


911
1:5:25,4 --> 1:5:28,6
is that it's pleasingly mystical,
it comes from the East


912
1:5:28,6 --> 1:5:33,72
but at the same time it ties
in with an "anything goes"
materialist lifestyle.


913
1:5:33,72 --> 1:5:35,36
How do you speak to that?


914
1:5:35,36 --> 1:5:39,4
I don't mean any disrespect by this,
but I have some friends


915
1:5:39,4 --> 1:5:41,64
who use Buddhism
and Eastern religion,


916
1:5:41,64 --> 1:5:44,36
Eastern philosophy,
and they mix it up with New Age,


917
1:5:44,36 --> 1:5:51,8
and that's OK, if it works for them,
but my concern is that
it is that sort of anything goes,


918
1:5:51,8 --> 1:5:56,64
you know, it's a free market
in spirituality. Whatever I'm saying
and thinking today is fine.


919
1:5:56,64 --> 1:6:0,28
Because we have these core teachings
in Buddhism, it keeps us in check,


920
1:6:0,28 --> 1:6:4,44
so we don't go into anything,
"If it feels good, it's OK."


921
1:6:4,44 --> 1:6:6,32
We're really trying to avoid that.


922
1:6:6,32 --> 1:6:11,2
Buddhism gave me a discipline
without a necessity of a God


923
1:6:11,2 --> 1:6:13,56
to reward me or punish me.


924
1:6:13,56 --> 1:6:17,84
There has been a tenfold
increase in the number of Buddhists


925
1:6:17,84 --> 1:6:21,8
in Europe and America
over the last 40 years.


926
1:6:21,8 --> 1:6:26,6
Most observers put the figure
at between two to three million
practising Buddhists in America,


927
1:6:26,6 --> 1:6:33,8
with the number of Buddhist
"sympathisers" estimated
at over 10 million.


928
1:6:33,8 --> 1:6:37,92
The His Lai temple is one example of
the modern expansionism of Buddhism.


929
1:6:37,92 --> 1:6:44,84
BUDDHIST CHANTING


930
1:6:44,84 --> 1:6:49,32
Many Buddhists come to the
His Lai temple for worship...


931
1:6:49,32 --> 1:6:56,64
..others come
to practise meditation.


932
1:6:56,64 --> 1:6:59,88
In the West, there's recently
been great interest in yoga,


933
1:6:59,88 --> 1:7:2,96
simply as a way to keep fit
and as a form of meditation.


934
1:7:2,96 --> 1:7:8,68
Yoga has its roots in Indian
traditions that predate
both Hinduism and Buddhism


935
1:7:8,68 --> 1:7:14,92
and it's sometimes used by Hindus
to assert mind over matter.


936
1:7:14,92 --> 1:7:22,44
For Buddhists, yoga's key purpose is
to achieve personal enlightenment.


937
1:7:22,44 --> 1:7:25,0
It is a very
ancient philosophy, Buddhism,


938
1:7:25,0 --> 1:7:29,48
but in some ways do you think
it is very suited to American life,


939
1:7:29,48 --> 1:7:32,64
because it does have
this kind of can-do attitude.


940
1:7:32,64 --> 1:7:36,0
It's very suited to America.


941
1:7:36,0 --> 1:7:42,96
One reason is that we've been
materialistic, we're known for it,


942
1:7:42,96 --> 1:7:46,6
and I've found in my experience, it
doesn't get you where you want to be.


943
1:7:46,6 --> 1:7:52,28
I can't believe that I'm alone
in that, I can't believe that.


944
1:7:52,28 --> 1:7:57,52
It offers reasons why that is.


945
1:7:57,52 --> 1:8:0,8
I'm sure other people, like me,


946
1:8:0,8 --> 1:8:5,16
who can't understand why all
this stuff didn't make them happy


947
1:8:5,16 --> 1:8:7,72
would be looking for something else.


948
1:8:7,72 --> 1:8:13,64
I'm not surprised that it is popular.


949
1:8:13,64 --> 1:8:19,32
It's not against any other religion
and it's not against science.


950
1:8:19,32 --> 1:8:22,76
It's very in line with everything.


951
1:8:22,76 --> 1:8:27,28
The temple then offers American
Buddhists lots of reasons to visit.


952
1:8:27,28 --> 1:8:32,48
But if you're a devotee of Buddhism,
then one of your main motivations
for coming here


953
1:8:32,48 --> 1:8:35,72
is to seek enlightenment...


954
1:8:35,72 --> 1:8:37,52
..Nirvana.


955
1:8:37,52 --> 1:8:42,72
I'd love to be able to tell you
that I've got a textbook definition
for what Nirvana is,


956
1:8:42,72 --> 1:8:47,92
but considering the Buddha himself
said it was beyond words,
beyond logic,


957
1:8:47,92 --> 1:8:53,64
I suspect it is going to be
quite a tricky concept to pin down.


958
1:8:53,64 --> 1:8:56,12
Nirvana certainly
is a state of mind,


959
1:8:56,12 --> 1:8:58,28
and it's a state of mind


960
1:8:58,28 --> 1:9:1,96
in which you have
abolished strong emotions


961
1:9:1,96 --> 1:9:4,48
of very much wanting things


962
1:9:4,48 --> 1:9:8,28
or very much hating things
or being confused.


963
1:9:8,28 --> 1:9:15,76
It's a state of mind
which you attain, and, at that
moment, and thereafter,


964
1:9:15,76 --> 1:9:20,68
you will enjoy
a kind of blissful calm.


965
1:9:20,68 --> 1:9:25,72
And that path, is the end of that
path, Nirvana, is that your goal?


966
1:9:25,72 --> 1:9:31,48
Yes, Nirvana, enlightenment,
full understanding, awakening.


967
1:9:31,48 --> 1:9:36,68
Those are all terms that are very
similar and, to me,
it's understanding the truth,


968
1:9:36,68 --> 1:9:41,16
understanding what this is,
what it really is.


969
1:9:41,16 --> 1:9:44,52
How confident are you that Nirvana
is a goal you are going to attain?


970
1:9:44,52 --> 1:9:49,8
I am cautiously optimistic -
how about that?


971
1:9:49,8 --> 1:9:53,4
There are people that say
that it's very possible,


972
1:9:53,4 --> 1:9:57,8
and these are people
that are very smart people
and I'm following their advice


973
1:9:57,8 --> 1:10:7,0
and I think it can be done.
I think it can be done.


974
1:10:7,0 --> 1:10:13,68
Like so much in Buddhism,
Nirvana clearly has
to be experienced, not explained.


975
1:10:13,68 --> 1:10:17,6
But for Buddhists, the journey
to get there, the path you take,


976
1:10:17,6 --> 1:10:23,2
seems to be as important
as the arriving.


977
1:10:23,2 --> 1:10:29,76
Buddhists will tell you that Nirvana
has no fixed point in time or space.


978
1:10:29,76 --> 1:10:34,56
That's actually a little ironic
because one of the few accepted
fixtures of the Buddhist story


979
1:10:34,56 --> 1:10:38,4
is where the Buddha himself
found enlightenment.


980
1:10:38,4 --> 1:10:40,88
We're told that that took place
in Northern India


981
1:10:40,88 --> 1:10:48,44
under the spreading branches
of a peepul tree.


982
1:10:48,44 --> 1:10:53,68
Which is where my quest had started,
at Bodhgaya, at this spot


983
1:10:53,68 --> 1:10:59,36
where it's said Buddhist philosophy
really began 2,500 years ago.


984
1:10:59,36 --> 1:11:2,64
In this journey I have explored
key facets of Buddhist belief


985
1:11:2,64 --> 1:11:6,16
and got a little closer
to understanding something vital


986
1:11:6,16 --> 1:11:10,6
about the core of Buddhist
philosophy, the Dharma.


987
1:11:10,6 --> 1:11:13,96
The Dharma is simply
the way the world is.


988
1:11:13,96 --> 1:11:16,76
We can all best live our lives
if we follow a path


989
1:11:16,76 --> 1:11:22,12
that allows us to deal
with the world as passionately,
as compassionately,


990
1:11:22,12 --> 1:11:26,6
as positively
and as wisely as possible.


991
1:11:26,6 --> 1:11:31,4
Now, whatever the permutations
and interpretations of Buddhism,


992
1:11:31,4 --> 1:11:36,76
that seems to me to be pretty simple
and pretty enlightened.


993
1:11:36,76 --> 1:11:42,44
I've learnt about Karma, how mindful
actions impact on our lives,


994
1:11:42,44 --> 1:11:45,68
about Samsara, the cycle
of life, birth and death,


995
1:11:45,68 --> 1:11:50,8
about meditation, about Zen,


996
1:11:50,8 --> 1:11:54,4
and the final goal
for all Buddhists, Nirvana.


997
1:11:54,4 --> 1:11:59,12
I have seen some of the most
beautiful architecture
inspired by Buddhist ideas


998
1:11:59,12 --> 1:12:4,4
and how, after 25 centuries,
Buddhism still attracts
millions across the globe.


999
1:12:4,4 --> 1:12:11,12
A philosophy that is rooted
in its ancient past and yet
gives character to the modern world.


1000
1:12:11,12 --> 1:12:18,0
How Buddhism places
the responsibility to realise
the truth on all of us.


1001
1:12:18,0 --> 1:12:23,12
As Buddhism travelled,
it transformed the cultures
it came into contact with,


1002
1:12:23,12 --> 1:12:26,2
just as it too was transformed.


1003
1:12:26,2 --> 1:12:30,6
You wonder if Buddha could ever
possibly have imagined the impact


1004
1:12:30,6 --> 1:12:33,2
that his ideas
would have on human history,


1005
1:12:33,2 --> 1:12:36,92
particularly given the one thing
he was certain about,


1006
1:12:36,92 --> 1:12:43,16
was that impermanence and change
were the only things
that were definite in this world.


1007
1:12:43,16 --> 1:12:47,84
Just listen to this - it's one
of his most poetic epithets.


1008
1:12:47,84 --> 1:12:51,0
"So shall you think
of all this fleeting world.


1009
1:12:51,0 --> 1:12:54,64
"A star at dawn,
a bubble in a stream,


1010
1:12:54,64 --> 1:12:57,56
"a flash of lightning
in a summer cloud,


1011
1:12:57,56 --> 1:13:2,84
"a flickering lamp,
a phantom, and a dream."


1012
1:13:2,84 --> 1:13:9,4
Well, the Buddha's dreams of 2,500
years ago are still with us


1013
1:13:9,4 --> 1:13:14,6
and they've been made incarnate
in one of the most tenacious
belief systems of all time


1014
1:13:14,6 --> 1:13:38,76
and in some of the most iconic and
beautiful monuments in the world.
