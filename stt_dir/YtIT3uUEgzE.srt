0:0:14,7 --> 0:0:17,44
SUROOSH ALVI: In Karachi,
politics is a contact sport,


3
0:0:17,44 --> 0:0:20,32
and members of Pakistan's dozens
of political parties


4
0:0:20,32 --> 0:0:21,57
have been known to
put more trust in


5
0:0:21,57 --> 0:0:24,31
bullets than in ballots.


6
0:0:24,31 --> 0:0:28,42
Mob violence, bombings, and
assassinations are sadly par


7
0:0:28,42 --> 0:0:30,36
for the course here.


8
0:0:30,36 --> 0:0:33,31
And while political leaders are
often targeted, the rank


9
0:0:33,31 --> 0:0:35,69
and file suffer the
consequences, too.


10
0:0:35,69 --> 0:0:38,79
We are driving into the
ANP stronghold.


11
0:0:38,79 --> 0:0:40,74
It's the Awami National Party.


12
0:0:40,74 --> 0:0:41,98
On this side is the ANP.


13
0:0:41,98 --> 0:0:44,41
On this side is the
MQM stronghold.


14
0:0:44,41 --> 0:0:46,846
And apparently, they have a
lot of beef, because they


15
0:0:46,846 --> 0:0:49,91
shoot each other.


16
0:0:49,91 --> 0:0:51,8
We met up with Hamza Khan,
one of the local


17
0:0:51,8 --> 0:0:53,75
leaders of the ANP.


18
0:0:53,75 --> 0:0:56,77
The ANP are the largest party
representing Pashtuns, the


19
0:0:56,77 --> 0:0:59,57
Pashto-speaking ethnic group
concentrated in Pakistan and


20
0:0:59,57 --> 0:1:1,1
Afghanistan.


21
0:1:1,1 --> 0:1:3,28
He took us out onto
the main road.


22
0:1:3,28 --> 0:1:5,79
This corridor often turns into
a kind of shooting gallery


23
0:1:5,79 --> 0:1:8,52
between these two rival groups,
as evidenced by the


24
0:1:8,52 --> 0:1:11,22
bullet holes throughout
the neighborhood.


25
0:1:11,22 --> 0:1:14,8
And why aren't you worried
that people won't


26
0:1:14,8 --> 0:1:16,6
shoot at us right now?


27
0:1:16,6 --> 0:1:24,34



28
0:1:24,34 --> 0:1:25,31
MALE SPEAKER: Maybe we
should go up, then,


29
0:1:25,31 --> 0:1:26,47
as soon as we can.


30
0:1:26,47 --> 0:1:27,72
Maybe we should make
our way to the top.


31
0:1:27,72 --> 0:1:30,13



32
0:1:30,13 --> 0:1:30,57
SUROOSH ALVI: Allah
is with us.


33
0:1:30,57 --> 0:1:31,82
We'll be OK, Insha'Allah.


34
0:1:31,82 --> 0:1:39,97



35
0:1:39,97 --> 0:1:42,71
From the high vantage point, not
only could we see the line


36
0:1:42,71 --> 0:1:45,26
that separates these two
neighborhoods, but we could


37
0:1:45,26 --> 0:1:48,8
finally see what they were
so often fighting for--


38
0:1:48,8 --> 0:1:49,23
land.


39
0:1:49,23 --> 0:1:51,73
That is, the lack of it.


40
0:1:51,73 --> 0:1:54,88
Land is the most precious
commodity in Karachi, a city


41
0:1:54,88 --> 0:1:57,95
that has grown exponentially
in recent decades.


42
0:1:57,95 --> 0:2:0,66
So while Pakistani politics
are often organized around


43
0:2:0,66 --> 0:2:4,19
ethnic or interest groups, in
Karachi, what most of those


44
0:2:4,19 --> 0:2:6,9
groups want is more land.


45
0:2:6,9 --> 0:2:25,11



46
0:2:25,11 --> 0:2:27,0
SUROOSH ALVI: The MQM is a
party that was founded to


47
0:2:27,0 --> 0:2:29,51
represent the Urdu-speaking
Muslims whose families


48
0:2:29,51 --> 0:2:32,38
migrated to Pakistan
from India.


49
0:2:32,38 --> 0:2:34,74
We headed to the heavily
barricaded neighborhood that's


50
0:2:34,74 --> 0:2:37,45
home to MQM headquarters.


51
0:2:37,45 --> 0:2:39,92
The neighborhood was plastered
with images of the MQM's


52
0:2:39,92 --> 0:2:42,77
charismatic leader,
Altaf Hussain.


53
0:2:42,77 --> 0:2:44,1
This one is awesome,
by the way.


54
0:2:44,1 --> 0:2:46,42
It looks like all
album covers.


55
0:2:46,42 --> 0:2:49,1
That's his psychedelic era.


56
0:2:49,1 --> 0:2:51,2
MALE SPEAKER: Look at him over
here, he's into iris.


57
0:2:51,2 --> 0:2:52,933
SUROOSH ALVI: This one, he's
trying to go for the Che


58
0:2:52,933 --> 0:2:53,366
Guevara vibe.


59
0:2:53,366 --> 0:2:56,24
MALE SPEAKER: Mary J.


60
0:2:56,24 --> 0:2:58,32
SUROOSH ALVI: Because he fears
assassination, Hussain


61
0:2:58,32 --> 0:3:1,7
communicates with his followers
via Skype from his


62
0:3:1,7 --> 0:3:3,56
home in London.


63
0:3:3,56 --> 0:3:5,96
So instead, we met with the
Minister for Youth Affairs,


64
0:3:5,96 --> 0:3:7,21
Faisal Sabzwari.


65
0:3:7,21 --> 0:3:9,98



66
0:3:9,98 --> 0:3:14,35
We were in the kind ANP
neighborhood yesterday--


67
0:3:14,35 --> 0:3:16,66
Kati Pahari-- and they
don't like the MQM


68
0:3:16,66 --> 0:3:18,34
too much over there.


69
0:3:18,34 --> 0:3:22,77
They accuse MQM of terrorism.


70
0:3:22,77 --> 0:3:26,25
FAISAL SABZWARI: The issue with
ANP in Karachi has been


71
0:3:26,25 --> 0:3:29,21
that some thugs and
goons have been


72
0:3:29,21 --> 0:3:31,2
running the show in Karachi.


73
0:3:31,2 --> 0:3:35,27
Extortion, kidnapping for
ransom, drug money--


74
0:3:35,27 --> 0:3:37,6
that's what some people
under the flag of


75
0:3:37,6 --> 0:3:38,86
ANP have been doing.


76
0:3:38,86 --> 0:3:40,99
SUROOSH ALVI: You can call them
thugs and goons, but I


77
0:3:40,99 --> 0:3:44,72
think MQM, also, people are
intimidated by, because there


78
0:3:44,72 --> 0:3:47,2
are thugs and goons on
your side as well.


79
0:3:47,2 --> 0:3:49,485
FAISAL SABZWARI: No, I reject
that idea as well.


80
0:3:49,485 --> 0:3:55,53
We have no such kind of
a group of people yet.


81
0:3:55,53 --> 0:3:56,68
SUROOSH ALVI: There's
no military or--


82
0:3:56,68 --> 0:3:57,46
FAISAL SABZWARI: No way--


83
0:3:57,46 --> 0:3:58,37
yet.


84
0:3:58,37 --> 0:3:59,13
Yet.


85
0:3:59,13 --> 0:3:59,87
There are areas.


86
0:3:59,87 --> 0:4:2,67
If you have visited Kati
Pahari, people in those


87
0:4:2,67 --> 0:4:5,54
particular areas are forced
to carry out.


88
0:4:5,54 --> 0:4:6,24
Why?


89
0:4:6,24 --> 0:4:12,36
Because we are living amongst
those fanatics, amongst those


90
0:4:12,36 --> 0:4:17,519
people who have no respect to
human life, whose politics is


91
0:4:17,519 --> 0:4:21,19
only commercialized interest.


92
0:4:21,19 --> 0:4:22,71
SUROOSH ALVI: So the short
version of all this is that


93
0:4:22,71 --> 0:4:25,31
people are getting killed
in Karachi every day.


94
0:4:25,31 --> 0:4:28,64
There's gang violence, tons of
mafia, sectarian killings, and


95
0:4:28,64 --> 0:4:31,2
in more recent years,
suicide bombings.


96
0:4:31,2 --> 0:4:34,296
For the political parties,
it's a massive turf war.


97
0:4:34,296 --> 0:4:36,71
And while politicians and
businessmen would never admit


98
0:4:36,71 --> 0:4:39,3
that they engage in
assassinating their rivals,


99
0:4:39,3 --> 0:4:43,51
someone is hiring the so-called
target killers.


100
0:4:43,51 --> 0:4:45,69
We wanted to interview one of
the men responsible for this


101
0:4:45,69 --> 0:4:49,26
dirty work, so we arranged a
meeting with a target killer.


102
0:4:49,26 --> 0:4:52,23
It was uncomfortable for
everyone involved.


103
0:4:52,23 --> 0:4:54,43
We negotiated the terms
of the interview--


104
0:4:54,43 --> 0:4:58,33
in a moving car and with his
motorcycle helmet on.


105
0:4:58,33 --> 0:5:1,55
And not surprisingly, the guy
who kills people for money, he


106
0:5:1,55 --> 0:5:3,84
wanted to get paid.

117
0:8:4,66 --> 0:8:9,11



118
0:8:9,11 --> 0:8:10,36
That was--


119
0:8:10,36 --> 0:8:13,78



120
0:8:13,78 --> 0:8:14,19
yeah.


121
0:8:14,19 --> 0:8:23,33
That was really strange, sitting
next to someone who's


122
0:8:23,33 --> 0:8:24,84
killed 35 people.


123
0:8:24,84 --> 0:8:28,36
And you could just tell from his
demeanor and from his eyes


124
0:8:28,36 --> 0:8:29,595
he was a hard dude.


125
0:8:29,595 --> 0:8:35,809
And there's 600 guys like that
roaming around this city.


126
0:8:35,809 --> 0:8:40,2
Anytime anyone has beef to
settle with someone else, they


127
0:8:40,2 --> 0:8:42,725
want to kill them, just hire one
of these guys, don't pay


128
0:8:42,725 --> 0:8:46,35
them much money, and they'll
do the work.


129
0:8:46,35 --> 0:8:51,9
It's lawless, wild,
and chaotic here.


130
0:8:51,9 --> 0:8:55,906
And that is some scary shit.


131
0:8:55,906 --> 0:9:2,55



132
0:9:2,55 --> 0:9:5,52
And on a lighter note, two
thieves got shot and killed.


133
0:9:5,52 --> 0:9:8,25
They're going to go pick the
bodies up, and they've


134
0:9:8,25 --> 0:9:10,72
inviting us to go along.


135
0:9:10,72 --> 0:9:12,84
One thing had become clear
on this trip--


136
0:9:12,84 --> 0:9:17,22
there's no shortage of murder
and mayhem in Karachi.


137
0:9:17,22 --> 0:9:20,92
Between the gangs and the cops
and the politicians and the


138
0:9:20,92 --> 0:9:23,98
target killers, this was
definitely one of the craziest


139
0:9:23,98 --> 0:9:25,3
cities in the world.


140
0:9:25,3 --> 0:9:27,85
But that's coming from me.


141
0:9:27,85 --> 0:9:31,12
I asked the ambulance driver, a
native Karachiite, how he'd


142
0:9:31,12 --> 0:9:32,56
describe the city.
