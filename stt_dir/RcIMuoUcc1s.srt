ROCCO CASTORO: I recently
wrote an article for the


4
0:0:28,7 --> 0:0:30,79
technology issue
of "Vice" about


5
0:0:30,79 --> 0:0:31,97
"The Anarchist Cookbook".


6
0:0:31,97 --> 0:0:33,76
And if you don't know what "The
Anarchist Cookbook" is,


7
0:0:33,76 --> 0:0:36,35
it was written in 1971
by a 19-year-old


8
0:0:36,35 --> 0:0:37,51
named William Powell.


9
0:0:37,51 --> 0:0:40,56
It was a response to the Vietnam
War and a type of


10
0:0:40,56 --> 0:0:43,67
field manual for civil
unrest at the time.


11
0:0:43,67 --> 0:0:46,92
And it contains stuff like how
to make TNT, how to kill


12
0:0:46,92 --> 0:0:49,97
people with your bare hands,
firearms knowledge, and all


13
0:0:49,97 --> 0:0:50,89
sorts of fun stuff.


14
0:0:50,89 --> 0:0:53,63
A few years later he actually
became a born again Christian


15
0:0:53,63 --> 0:0:56,6
and requested that the book be
taken off the shelves and


16
0:0:56,6 --> 0:0:57,4
taken out of print.


17
0:0:57,4 --> 0:0:59,18
Unfortunately for him he
didn't have that luxury


18
0:0:59,18 --> 0:1:2,42
because he sold the original
copyright to the publisher and


19
0:1:2,42 --> 0:1:4,78
today you can still buy
the thing on Amazon.


20
0:1:4,78 --> 0:1:7,55
Somewhere around the mid-1980s
things took kind of an


21
0:1:7,55 --> 0:1:10,84
interesting turn with
the heyday of


22
0:1:10,84 --> 0:1:12,53
bulletin board systems.


23
0:1:12,53 --> 0:1:16,49
Someone compiled this list of
instructions on how to make


24
0:1:16,49 --> 0:1:20,57
low-grade explosives and stuff
like flaming tennis balls, and


25
0:1:20,57 --> 0:1:23,7
just general malcontent shit.


26
0:1:23,7 --> 0:1:25,19
And somewhere along the line
they appropriated William


27
0:1:25,19 --> 0:1:28,7
Powell's original title "The
Anarchist Cookbook" and people


28
0:1:28,7 --> 0:1:31,7
started calling it that even
though it had very little


29
0:1:31,7 --> 0:1:32,92
resemblance to the original.


30
0:1:32,92 --> 0:1:35,42
A lot of people know about "The
Anarchist Cookbook" but I


31
0:1:35,42 --> 0:1:37,14
don't know too many people that
have actually tried the


32
0:1:37,14 --> 0:1:39,42
entries out for themselves, and
they're rumored to be very


33
0:1:39,42 --> 0:1:41,91
dangerous and incomplete
and incorrect.


34
0:1:41,91 --> 0:1:43,59
So I thought it would be a good
idea to head out to a


35
0:1:43,59 --> 0:1:46,71
warehouse in Brooklyn and just
blow some shit up and see if


36
0:1:46,71 --> 0:1:49,162
there was any merit
to these recipes.

38
0:2:5,13 --> 0:2:7,81
ROCCO CASTORO: It's pretty
simple here.


39
0:2:7,81 --> 0:2:10,56
You just take Strike
Anywhere matches--


40
0:2:10,56 --> 0:2:13,45
just going to be cutting
the match heads off.


41
0:2:13,45 --> 0:2:18,21
I think we figured out that for
each tennis ball you need


42
0:2:18,21 --> 0:2:20,328
about 3,000 match heads.


43
0:2:20,328 --> 0:2:25,648
And you want to cut in maybe a
quarter of an inch, and get a


44
0:2:25,648 --> 0:2:27,58
split tennis ball.


45
0:2:27,58 --> 0:2:29,4
Let's do some sandpaper now.


46
0:2:29,4 --> 0:2:34,968



47
0:2:34,968 --> 0:2:36,944
Literally drop your
matches in there.


48
0:2:36,944 --> 0:2:40,91



49
0:2:40,91 --> 0:2:44,59
Just in case Strike Anywhere
match-filled tennis balls


50
0:2:44,59 --> 0:2:47,93
don't explode like we hope,
we're going to have a plan B.


51
0:2:47,93 --> 0:2:53,97
And we're breaking apart some
bottle rockets, getting the


52
0:2:53,97 --> 0:2:57,17
black powder out, and we're
going to make a combination of


53
0:2:57,17 --> 0:3:0,26
matches and black powder
in one of the balls.


54
0:3:0,26 --> 0:3:5,3
We don't know how many parts
powder compared to how many


55
0:3:5,3 --> 0:3:8,196
parts matches we should be
using, so we're just going to


56
0:3:8,196 --> 0:3:9,474
fill up the entire
fucking thing.

Maybe a little bit
of cardboard.

essentially.

kind of silly to begin with--


74
0:4:10,56 --> 0:4:14,27
make blow darts out of
these pipes, and


75
0:4:14,27 --> 0:4:17,24
yarn, and pencil erasers.


76
0:4:17,24 --> 0:4:20,269

suspected it wasn't really


77
0:4:20,269 --> 0:4:21,55
going to do anything.


78
0:4:21,55 --> 0:4:26,33
So basically you just take a
pencil eraser, push it down to


79
0:4:26,33 --> 0:4:29,35
the end of the dart, which
serves as a kind


80
0:4:29,35 --> 0:4:31,292
of a stopper here.

as kind of like a feather.

going to work that well, and

really make one of these.
