0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:2,583
RYAN DUFFY: Today we hunt the LA
paparazzi, learn about sex


2
0:0:2,583 --> 0:0:4,59
from a woman in shoulder
pads, and get yet


3
0:0:4,59 --> 0:0:5,95
another etiquette update.


4
0:0:5,95 --> 0:0:10,1
ANNOUNCER: "Vice Today--"
biweekly bite-sized doses of


5
0:0:10,1 --> 0:0:13,365
sex, drugs, and rock and roll.


6
0:0:13,365 --> 0:0:16,35



7
0:0:16,35 --> 0:0:18,3
RYAN DUFFY: Hey, I'm Ryan Duffy,
and welcome to "Vice


8
0:0:18,3 --> 0:0:21,23
Today." On this episode, we meet
another one of our weird


9
0:0:21,23 --> 0:0:23,56
and wonderful neighbors from
the internet, sex blogger


10
0:0:23,56 --> 0:0:27,53
Rachel Rabbit White on another
episode of My Life Online.


11
0:0:27,53 --> 0:0:29,46
Then we get another round of
etiquette updates from the


12
0:0:29,46 --> 0:0:31,72
classiest bearded blowhard
we know.


13
0:0:31,72 --> 0:0:34,69
But right now, in the very first
"Vice Today" special, we


14
0:0:34,69 --> 0:0:37,55
head out to LA and give the
paparazzi a taste of their own


15
0:0:37,55 --> 0:0:38,73
toxic medicine.


16
0:0:38,73 --> 0:0:39,81
This is Pap Smear.


17
0:0:39,81 --> 0:0:42,8
PAPARAZZO: This way, please.


18
0:0:42,8 --> 0:0:44,16
William, guys, please.


19
0:0:44,16 --> 0:0:45,126
This way.


20
0:0:45,126 --> 0:0:47,58
PAPARAZZO: Hey, let's wait
'til he come out.


21
0:0:47,58 --> 0:0:47,541
PAPARAZZO: Emma!


22
0:0:47,541 --> 0:0:48,99
Emma!


23
0:0:48,99 --> 0:0:49,956
Down here, please!


24
0:0:49,956 --> 0:0:58,18
[MUSIC PLAYING]


25
0:0:58,18 --> 0:1:0,2
STEVE: I think we can all agree
that paparazzi are some


26
0:1:0,2 --> 0:1:1,94
of the lowest forms of
life on planet Earth.


27
0:1:1,94 --> 0:1:4,37
The ever-growing business of
invading public person's


28
0:1:4,37 --> 0:1:7,5
privacy and the seemingly
insatiable appetite for such


29
0:1:7,5 --> 0:1:9,86
garbage prove that more than
ever people are looking for


30
0:1:9,86 --> 0:1:11,3
glimpses into lives
that seem more


31
0:1:11,3 --> 0:1:12,6
interesting than their own.


32
0:1:12,6 --> 0:1:14,22
PAPARAZZO: I love you!


33
0:1:14,22 --> 0:1:18,67
[MUSIC PLAYING]


34
0:1:18,67 --> 0:1:20,61
STEVE: When "Vice" asked me if
I wanted to write a story


35
0:1:20,61 --> 0:1:23,27
about this profession, I jumped
at the opportunity.


36
0:1:23,27 --> 0:1:25,78
I had to know, were they
just trying to get by?


37
0:1:25,78 --> 0:1:27,56
I decided to go directly
to the source.


38
0:1:27,56 --> 0:1:30,7
Going down Melrose here where
we're going to meet the


39
0:1:30,7 --> 0:1:31,64
photographers, [BLEEP].


40
0:1:31,64 --> 0:1:32,88
I don't know his last name.


41
0:1:32,88 --> 0:1:34,13
And it's probably
better that way.


42
0:1:34,13 --> 0:1:37,35



43
0:1:37,35 --> 0:1:40,53
After asking various contacts I
was put in touch with Peter,


44
0:1:40,53 --> 0:1:42,91
a professional and somewhat
jaded paparazzo who agreed to


45
0:1:42,91 --> 0:1:44,78
give me all the pertinent
details I would need to


46
0:1:44,78 --> 0:1:46,7
capture my prey in exchange
for his anonymity.


47
0:1:46,7 --> 0:1:48,22
What is it?


48
0:1:48,22 --> 0:1:49,48
What is a paparazzi to you?


49
0:1:49,48 --> 0:1:58,82



50
0:1:58,82 --> 0:2:1,29
STEVE: He also said that there
are a select few freelance


51
0:2:1,29 --> 0:2:3,66
photographers, such as himself,
who adhere to a moral


52
0:2:3,66 --> 0:2:4,91
code of sorts.


53
0:2:4,91 --> 0:2:37,762



54
0:2:37,762 --> 0:2:43,1
STEVE: What did you do before
this career as a pap?


55
0:2:43,1 --> 0:2:48,677



56
0:2:48,677 --> 0:2:50,94
STEVE: It sounds kind of like
a stripper being asked to be


57
0:2:50,94 --> 0:2:51,575
called a dancer.


58
0:2:51,575 --> 0:2:53,274
You're not really dancing.


59
0:2:53,274 --> 0:3:17,16



60
0:3:17,16 --> 0:3:19,54
STEVE: He also schooled me on
the paparazzi circuit and its


61
0:3:19,54 --> 0:3:20,79
respective territories.


62
0:3:20,79 --> 0:3:35,38



63
0:3:35,38 --> 0:3:37,39
STEVE: With this information at
my disposal, I was ready to


64
0:3:37,39 --> 0:3:39,1
start my rampage of
invasiveness.


65
0:3:39,1 --> 0:3:43,3
Going to post up and try
to hunt the hunters.


66
0:3:43,3 --> 0:3:45,77
My photographer and I headed
straight for the guitar statue


67
0:3:45,77 --> 0:3:48,69
outside BOA, a popular nightclub
on Sunset Boulevard


68
0:3:48,69 --> 0:3:49,96
frequented by celebrities.


69
0:3:49,96 --> 0:4:0,15



70
0:4:0,15 --> 0:4:2,54
STEVE: We see a huge guitar, and
there's two shady looking


71
0:4:2,54 --> 0:4:3,43
dudes in beanies.


72
0:4:3,43 --> 0:4:4,87
And they look like the
kind of guys that


73
0:4:4,87 --> 0:4:5,8
are willing to fight.


74
0:4:5,8 --> 0:4:7,17
We pulled up two blocks away.


75
0:4:7,17 --> 0:4:8,79
I'm starting to get nervous.


76
0:4:8,79 --> 0:4:11,3
We parked and went over our
plan, which basically amounted


77
0:4:11,3 --> 0:4:14,55
to getting in their faces and
asking increasingly personal


78
0:4:14,55 --> 0:4:16,524
and judgmental questions.


79
0:4:16,524 --> 0:4:20,88



80
0:4:20,88 --> 0:4:23,49
STEVE: A paparazzi is telling
me to not get too


81
0:4:23,49 --> 0:4:24,83
close to the story.


82
0:4:24,83 --> 0:4:26,3
That's funny.


83
0:4:26,3 --> 0:4:27,452
Hey, homie.


84
0:4:27,452 --> 0:4:27,878
How are you?


85
0:4:27,878 --> 0:4:28,73
How are you?


86
0:4:28,73 --> 0:4:31,2
Please tell us, what are
you wearing right now?


87
0:4:31,2 --> 0:4:32,58
Who are you wearing?


88
0:4:32,58 --> 0:4:34,93
Who are you wearing?


89
0:4:34,93 --> 0:4:37,11
What does your underwear
look like?


90
0:4:37,11 --> 0:4:37,87
Please tell us.


91
0:4:37,87 --> 0:4:39,91
Who are you with?


92
0:4:39,91 --> 0:4:41,85
Do you feel bad when you
go home at night


93
0:4:41,85 --> 0:4:43,54
doing this to people?


94
0:4:43,54 --> 0:4:46,64
Do you like a pinkie in
the butt during sex?


95
0:4:46,64 --> 0:4:47,9
Sir?


96
0:4:47,9 --> 0:4:47,315
Sir?


97
0:4:47,315 --> 0:4:48,44
Sir?


98
0:4:48,44 --> 0:4:50,59
When you're getting a blow job,
do you like one single


99
0:4:50,59 --> 0:4:52,202
pinkie in your butt?


100
0:4:52,202 --> 0:4:53,55
I'm not getting the scoop
from you, dude.


101
0:4:53,55 --> 0:4:55,11
We want to know just
one question,


102
0:4:55,11 --> 0:4:56,38
sir, just one question.


103
0:4:56,38 --> 0:5:0,346
Do you smell the toilet paper
after you wipe, sir?


104
0:5:0,346 --> 0:5:2,52
Do you go number two
in the workplace?


105
0:5:2,52 --> 0:5:4,67
Somehow I think in this
interview that you think


106
0:5:4,67 --> 0:5:6,998
you're holding on to some
last shred of what


107
0:5:6,998 --> 0:5:7,706
you're doing is art.


108
0:5:7,706 --> 0:5:8,178
It's not.


109
0:5:8,178 --> 0:5:11,482
You're taking pictures of
celebrities at vulnerable


110
0:5:11,482 --> 0:5:12,898
moments without their
permission.


111
0:5:12,898 --> 0:5:14,32
They don't know who you are.


112
0:5:14,32 --> 0:5:15,5
You guys interview
other people?


113
0:5:15,5 --> 0:5:16,3
How come I'm not allowed
to interview you?


114
0:5:16,3 --> 0:5:19,28



115
0:5:19,28 --> 0:5:22,87
Does this make you feel weird?


116
0:5:22,87 --> 0:5:24,655
If you guys do this for a
living, why are you so pissed


117
0:5:24,655 --> 0:5:27,8
off that we're doing
it to you?


118
0:5:27,8 --> 0:5:30,475
I'm not in your face.


119
0:5:30,475 --> 0:5:32,4
I just have a quick question.


120
0:5:32,4 --> 0:5:32,94
Why are you hiding?


121
0:5:32,94 --> 0:5:36,2
Why is there so much shame
behind what you're doing?


122
0:5:36,2 --> 0:5:38,37
You don't like your
own medicine, bro.


123
0:5:38,37 --> 0:5:40,66
You don't like the way it feels
to you, then why would


124
0:5:40,66 --> 0:5:43,89
you do that to your fellow
man and woman?


125
0:5:43,89 --> 0:5:45,81
You're getting mad at me
following you around trying to


126
0:5:45,81 --> 0:5:49,33
get a hot scoop, and that's
what you're doing.


127
0:5:49,33 --> 0:5:52,33
That'd be like a butcher who's
afraid of eating meat.


128
0:5:52,33 --> 0:5:56,55
Why hide in the bushes at a
restaurant for Paris Hilton's


129
0:5:56,55 --> 0:5:57,592
tit to fall out?


130
0:5:57,592 --> 0:6:0,43
If you're such a photographer,
why don't you go and shoot


131
0:6:0,43 --> 0:6:1,95
waves at Maui, or
why don't you--


132
0:6:1,95 --> 0:6:6,912



133
0:6:6,912 --> 0:6:8,162
STEVE: No.


134
0:6:8,162 --> 0:6:37,812



135
0:6:37,812 --> 0:6:39,53
STEVE: All right, this is Steve
for "Vice" magazine.


136
0:6:39,53 --> 0:6:40,47
I thought we were
going to have a


137
0:6:40,47 --> 0:6:41,76
really crazy story here.


138
0:6:41,76 --> 0:6:44,25
I heard stories of Brazilian
guys that loved to fight.


139
0:6:44,25 --> 0:6:45,63
Thought we were going
to encounter that.


140
0:6:45,63 --> 0:6:47,84
But what we encountered
is a bunch of cowards.


141
0:6:47,84 --> 0:6:49,55
Most of these guys are just
pussies, and they're not down


142
0:6:49,55 --> 0:6:50,91
to scrap or do anything
like that.


143
0:6:50,91 --> 0:6:53,56
So it's kind of fun story.


144
0:6:53,56 --> 0:6:55,38
But it was anti-climatic.


145
0:6:55,38 --> 0:6:57,57
Like, who these guys really are
that you see the pictures


146
0:6:57,57 --> 0:7:0,2
on TMZ, they're a bunch
of scared guys who--


147
0:7:0,2 --> 0:7:3,3
I'm sitting here solo, kind of
like a pussy myself, and they


148
0:7:3,3 --> 0:7:4,325
don't even want to
make eye contact.


149
0:7:4,325 --> 0:7:6,34
So they feel bad about
what they're doing.


150
0:7:6,34 --> 0:7:8,4
It's kind of like grinding
someone to the


151
0:7:8,4 --> 0:7:8,95
ground at this point.


152
0:7:8,95 --> 0:7:9,64
I'm going to just take off.


153
0:7:9,64 --> 0:7:10,72
I feel bad.


154
0:7:10,72 --> 0:7:11,1
Later, guys.


155
0:7:11,1 --> 0:7:13,42
Thanks for playing, man.


156
0:7:13,42 --> 0:7:14,515
Thank you.


157
0:7:14,515 --> 0:7:15,765
Good night.


158
0:7:15,765 --> 0:7:21,39



159
0:7:21,39 --> 0:7:23,64
RYAN DUFFY: Really?


160
0:7:23,64 --> 0:7:25,37
We wanted to call
that Pap Smear?


161
0:7:25,37 --> 0:7:27,3
I had to say "Pap Smear"
on camera?


162
0:7:27,3 --> 0:7:27,92
Pap Smear?


163
0:7:27,92 --> 0:7:29,17
Really?


164
0:7:29,17 --> 0:7:32,43
Next up, we meet sex blogger
Rachel Rabbit White who talks


165
0:7:32,43 --> 0:7:35,9
to us about transsexual stripper
parties, clown


166
0:7:35,9 --> 0:7:37,91
fetishists, and how she
certainly does not talk to her


167
0:7:37,91 --> 0:7:39,44
mom about her job.


168
0:7:39,44 --> 0:7:40,71
RACHEL RABBIT WHITE: Well,
people think that they can


169
0:7:40,71 --> 0:7:42,4
have sex with me a lot.


170
0:7:42,4 --> 0:7:43,28
INTERVIEWER: I'm sure.


171
0:7:43,28 --> 0:7:44,26
RACHEL RABBIT WHITE: Yeah.


172
0:7:44,26 --> 0:7:45,7
People think they can
have sex with me.


173
0:7:45,7 --> 0:7:48,24
And then people also think
I'm a porn star always.


174
0:7:48,24 --> 0:7:49,63
So a lot of times
people search--


175
0:7:49,63 --> 0:7:51,25
I see their Google searches.


176
0:7:51,25 --> 0:7:52,6
Rachel Rabbit White porn.


177
0:7:52,6 --> 0:7:54,18
Rachel Rabbit White porn star.


178
0:7:54,18 --> 0:7:55,9
Where is Rachel Rabbit
White's porn?


179
0:7:55,9 --> 0:7:58,21
People really think I'm a porn
star, and it's very confusing


180
0:7:58,21 --> 0:7:58,98
for them that I'm not.


181
0:7:58,98 --> 0:8:0,9
And I totally understand why
they would think that.


182
0:8:0,9 --> 0:8:2,77
Because a lot of the people that
are blogging about sex


183
0:8:2,77 --> 0:8:4,2
are in the sex industry.


184
0:8:4,2 --> 0:8:9,27
[MUSIC PLAYING]


185
0:8:9,27 --> 0:8:11,28
RACHEL RABBIT WHITE: The name
of my blog is my name, which


186
0:8:11,28 --> 0:8:12,46
is Rachel Rabbit White.


187
0:8:12,46 --> 0:8:14,49
So it's RachelRabbitWhite.com.


188
0:8:14,49 --> 0:8:19,88
I write about sex and gender
and relationships.


189
0:8:19,88 --> 0:8:22,75
And basically you'll see more
journalism style posts where


190
0:8:22,75 --> 0:8:25,1
I'm writing about other people's
sex lives, kinky,


191
0:8:25,1 --> 0:8:26,38
crazy things.


192
0:8:26,38 --> 0:8:29,26
The second is more memoir-type
stuff, and about my own life


193
0:8:29,26 --> 0:8:30,84
and my own relationships.


194
0:8:30,84 --> 0:8:32,78
And the third is advice.


195
0:8:32,78 --> 0:8:34,7
A lot of people ask
me questions about


196
0:8:34,7 --> 0:8:35,429
their own sex lives.


197
0:8:35,429 --> 0:8:37,71
So I record videos where
I try to help them


198
0:8:37,71 --> 0:8:38,635
and give them advice.


199
0:8:38,635 --> 0:8:41,78
OK, so despite what you may
have learned in sex ed in


200
0:8:41,78 --> 0:8:46,42
fifth grade from your school
nurse, I say that you should


201
0:8:46,42 --> 0:8:50,14
take sex advice from a
woman wearing pastels


202
0:8:50,14 --> 0:8:51,93
and shoulder pads.


203
0:8:51,93 --> 0:8:54,73
I think a lot of guys feel
the way that Grant and


204
0:8:54,73 --> 0:8:56,22
possibly you feel.


205
0:8:56,22 --> 0:8:58,52
They just want to
suck [BLEEP].


206
0:8:58,52 --> 0:8:58,79
And why wouldn't they?


207
0:8:58,79 --> 0:8:59,232
Sucking [BLEEP]


208
0:8:59,232 --> 0:8:59,95
is amazing.


209
0:8:59,95 --> 0:9:1,77
OK, can you see me?


210
0:9:1,77 --> 0:9:5,205
So I recently had a reader write
in and ask me for tips


211
0:9:5,205 --> 0:9:7,7
on taking sexy pictures.


212
0:9:7,7 --> 0:9:9,42
Great thing about this shot
is that if you're doing it


213
0:9:9,42 --> 0:9:12,33
actually naked and really
Craigslist style, it makes


214
0:9:12,33 --> 0:9:14,3
your tits look great
no matter what.


215
0:9:14,3 --> 0:9:16,49
So if you don't have any boobs,
kind of like me, it


216
0:9:16,49 --> 0:9:18,65
makes you look like all the
sudden that you do.


217
0:9:18,65 --> 0:9:21,69
I started the blog working
as an intake person


218
0:9:21,69 --> 0:9:23,71
at a donation clinic.


219
0:9:23,71 --> 0:9:25,48
And I knew I wanted
to be a writer.


220
0:9:25,48 --> 0:9:27,99
And I knew I wanted to be
writing, and I wasn't.


221
0:9:27,99 --> 0:9:29,92
So I started the blog to
force myself to write.


222
0:9:29,92 --> 0:9:31,14
This might be interesting.


223
0:9:31,14 --> 0:9:37,62
These are the slutty journals
from when I was 21, before I


224
0:9:37,62 --> 0:9:39,5
was seriously writing.


225
0:9:39,5 --> 0:9:41,63
I lived a pretty textured
existence.


226
0:9:41,63 --> 0:9:43,125
And then I think part of the
reason for starting the blog


227
0:9:43,125 --> 0:9:44,21
was working through my past.


228
0:9:44,21 --> 0:9:45,91
And part of the reason I was
writing about sex is because I


229
0:9:45,91 --> 0:9:47,21
used to have a lot of
sex and was having


230
0:9:47,21 --> 0:9:48,275
all these crazy stories.


231
0:9:48,275 --> 0:9:51,85
And I'm wondering about what
happens when you don't love


232
0:9:51,85 --> 0:9:54,57
somebody anymore and where
does the love go.


233
0:9:54,57 --> 0:9:56,79
Very overly dramatic stuff
that you would


234
0:9:56,79 --> 0:9:58,45
write when you're 20.


235
0:9:58,45 --> 0:9:59,74
But it's fun to have
this stuff.


236
0:9:59,74 --> 0:10:2,16
And it's fun to go back and use
it as writing fodder and


237
0:10:2,16 --> 0:10:4,14
to remember where my mind
actually was when I'm writing


238
0:10:4,14 --> 0:10:6,77
about me, sort of a
character at 20.


239
0:10:6,77 --> 0:10:10,38
And I think why I write about
sex and relationships is


240
0:10:10,38 --> 0:10:13,14
because, for a lot of young
people, that's sort of the


241
0:10:13,14 --> 0:10:15,79
biggest thing that's happened
in your life.


242
0:10:15,79 --> 0:10:17,83
For a lot of young people, their
biggest story is really


243
0:10:17,83 --> 0:10:19,68
that they lost their virginity
or that they


244
0:10:19,68 --> 0:10:21,19
were broken up with.


245
0:10:21,19 --> 0:10:22,79
When you're in your 20s, I think
these are the things


246
0:10:22,79 --> 0:10:24,57
that you're really
grappling with.


247
0:10:24,57 --> 0:10:27,82
And also, just to sort
of educate myself.


248
0:10:27,82 --> 0:10:30,96
I am genuinely interested in
what other people are doing


249
0:10:30,96 --> 0:10:33,69
and understanding what makes
other people tick sexually.


250
0:10:33,69 --> 0:10:36,78
So when I'm writing about
someone else's sex life, like


251
0:10:36,78 --> 0:10:40,13
maybe they like to have
clown sex, I really


252
0:10:40,13 --> 0:10:41,1
don't understand it.


253
0:10:41,1 --> 0:10:42,73
And I want to go out and
understand it and bring it


254
0:10:42,73 --> 0:10:45,12
back to the readers like,
here's what I found.


255
0:10:45,12 --> 0:10:47,92
If I weren't doing stories on
these things I would never be


256
0:10:47,92 --> 0:10:50,16
exposed to this world.


257
0:10:50,16 --> 0:10:52,31
And that's when I feel the most
alive, is when I'm out


258
0:10:52,31 --> 0:10:55,27
getting stories and exposing
myself to this sort of thing


259
0:10:55,27 --> 0:10:56,61
and running around the city.


260
0:10:56,61 --> 0:11:0,39
So I covered an all-transsexual
strip party in


261
0:11:0,39 --> 0:11:2,12
New York City.


262
0:11:2,12 --> 0:11:4,14
So I'm just going to read
you a few of my notes.


263
0:11:4,14 --> 0:11:6,9
The women are in Moulin
Rouge-inspired lingerie,


264
0:11:6,9 --> 0:11:10,14
glitter and garter belts,
dancing and stripping for a


265
0:11:10,14 --> 0:11:11,24
crowd of men.


266
0:11:11,24 --> 0:11:14,4
The men are of all ages, and
slink and hide in the corners


267
0:11:14,4 --> 0:11:16,91
in between approaching the
women as they dance.


268
0:11:16,91 --> 0:11:18,81
I'm introduced to-- and I don't
have her name here.


269
0:11:18,81 --> 0:11:20,31
I'm going to have
to look it up.


270
0:11:20,31 --> 0:11:22,52
She's been throwing trans
parties for a long time.


271
0:11:22,52 --> 0:11:24,26
She says those parties are
completely different.


272
0:11:24,26 --> 0:11:26,54
First of all, this is a
posh club, she says.


273
0:11:26,54 --> 0:11:28,49
There's also more focus
on costumes.


274
0:11:28,49 --> 0:11:30,1
And they actually dance.


275
0:11:30,1 --> 0:11:32,17
So while there's a drag queen
working the door, the place is


276
0:11:32,17 --> 0:11:33,55
not so much for a
queer audience.


277
0:11:33,55 --> 0:11:34,7
The gays don't come.


278
0:11:34,7 --> 0:11:36,964
But even if they did, it might
not work with what the


279
0:11:36,964 --> 0:11:38,1
promoter is looking for.


280
0:11:38,1 --> 0:11:40,42
He tells me that the guys that
come here don't want to see


281
0:11:40,42 --> 0:11:43,1
two men kissing at this party,
that this isn't what they're


282
0:11:43,1 --> 0:11:43,68
looking for.


283
0:11:43,68 --> 0:11:45,62
And this would scare them
and cause them to leave.


284
0:11:45,62 --> 0:11:47,82
And then that's as
far as I got.


285
0:11:47,82 --> 0:11:49,55
I'm not sure what
the fetish is.


286
0:11:49,55 --> 0:11:51,62
I mean, definitely they
want a penis.


287
0:11:51,62 --> 0:11:54,0
And these guys definitely, like
the guy said, they didn't


288
0:11:54,0 --> 0:11:55,16
want gay men there.


289
0:11:55,16 --> 0:11:57,61
They didn't want to be reminded
of the gay community.


290
0:11:57,61 --> 0:11:59,34
They were almost anti that.


291
0:11:59,34 --> 0:12:2,17
It's tough, because I don't
think there's a very good


292
0:12:2,17 --> 0:12:5,64
history of people reporting
within these sort of


293
0:12:5,64 --> 0:12:7,56
marginalized sex communities.


294
0:12:7,56 --> 0:12:9,58
So it's this line I'm constantly
walking where I


295
0:12:9,58 --> 0:12:11,25
admit if someone asks
me if I'm a writer.


296
0:12:11,25 --> 0:12:12,28
And if they ask if I'm
going to write


297
0:12:12,28 --> 0:12:14,25
about this, I say yes.


298
0:12:14,25 --> 0:12:16,84
But I try not to be so snarky.


299
0:12:16,84 --> 0:12:18,43
I really want to learn
why they're doing


300
0:12:18,43 --> 0:12:19,2
what they're doing.


301
0:12:19,2 --> 0:12:21,43
But I'm also honest in my
descriptions of them.


302
0:12:21,43 --> 0:12:23,469
I don't shy away
from the ugly.

you feel worse about humanity

socks, men's

0:12:51,87 --> 0:12:54,66
basketball, being bald--


312
0:12:54,66 --> 0:12:55,62
not classy.


313
0:12:55,62 --> 0:12:57,56
When you're in the bathroom,
don't leave

0:12:57,56 --> 0:12:59,7
magazines on the toilet.


315
0:12:59,7 --> 0:13:2,45
Don't leave matches on
top of the toilet.

Breakfast burritos, adults
watching cartoons,

snowboarding, 14-year-olds on
birth control, white socks,

Number one, don't
go to brunch.

Number two, don't go to brunch
with your girlfriend.


323

Brunch is for drinking.
