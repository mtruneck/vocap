0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:6,88



2
0:0:6,88 --> 0:0:8,189
"Spider" was so popular.


3
0:0:8,189 --> 0:0:11,76
And I had to say [INAUDIBLE],
could I make a sequel to it?


4
0:0:11,76 --> 0:0:14,15
It would be a film works on its
own as a standalone, and


5
0:0:14,15 --> 0:0:18,18
also lives up to what "Spider"
was, and also works as a


6
0:0:18,18 --> 0:0:22,9
sequel by taking the same
character and has this guy


7
0:0:22,9 --> 0:0:24,87
learned any lessons and what's
he like in his new


8
0:0:24,87 --> 0:0:26,9
relationship.


9
0:0:26,9 --> 0:0:30,88
I like that he's the bad
guy or evil character.


10
0:0:30,88 --> 0:0:32,28
But he's well-intentioned--


11
0:0:32,28 --> 0:0:34,7
this well-intentioned
guy that maims his


12
0:0:34,7 --> 0:0:40,22
girlfriends for love.


13
0:0:40,22 --> 0:0:43,11
A lot of people ask, is the
character in "Bear " and


14
0:0:43,11 --> 0:0:45,26
"Spider," is it based on me?


15
0:0:45,26 --> 0:0:47,24
And I guess, essentially,
I am the guy who


16
0:0:47,24 --> 0:0:49,79
does like to do pranks.


17
0:0:49,79 --> 0:0:51,62
I've never had one go
as bad as he does.


18
0:0:51,62 --> 0:0:55,36
So essentially, it's
an extension of me.


19
0:0:55,36 --> 0:0:59,51
But I'm not really that guy.


20
0:0:59,51 --> 0:1:2,73
He plans this elaborate picnic,
but then can't just


21
0:1:2,73 --> 0:1:3,57
have it be a normal picnic.


22
0:1:3,57 --> 0:1:5,53
He has to surprise her
with a bear suit.


23
0:1:5,53 --> 0:1:8,26
And then beyond that, once she
gets hurt, instead of taking


24
0:1:8,26 --> 0:1:11,1
her and trying to get her help,
he's talking about how


25
0:1:11,1 --> 0:1:15,32
great the bear suit is, which
is ultimately his undoing.


26
0:1:15,32 --> 0:1:17,82
Because "Spider" was in the
city, I wanted to take it into


27
0:1:17,82 --> 0:1:18,75
a different environment.


28
0:1:18,75 --> 0:1:20,37
Initially, my idea was
just to be in the


29
0:1:20,37 --> 0:1:22,18
wilderness of some sort.


30
0:1:22,18 --> 0:1:24,3
I also wanted to do an animal
that was so much bigger than


31
0:1:24,3 --> 0:1:25,2
the last one.


32
0:1:25,2 --> 0:1:27,95
One of the main things with
"Bear" for me was knowing that


33
0:1:27,95 --> 0:1:30,625
the bear suit had to be right.


34
0:1:30,625 --> 0:1:35,86
And I contacted Nick and Paul at
MEG who had done the needle


35
0:1:35,86 --> 0:1:39,8
in the eye effect in "Spider,"
just asking them if they had a


36
0:1:39,8 --> 0:1:40,815
bear suit or if they knew
someone who had one.


37
0:1:40,815 --> 0:1:43,3
When I called them, they were
like, yeah, we have three.


38
0:1:43,3 --> 0:1:46,14
We have a momma bear, a papa
bear, and a baby bear.


39
0:1:46,14 --> 0:1:48,35
And so I went round and I tried
on the papa bear suit.


40
0:1:48,35 --> 0:1:54,91
And it was so far beyond what
I imagined they would have,


41
0:1:54,91 --> 0:1:56,21
and so good.


42
0:1:56,21 --> 0:1:57,85
When I tried it on,
I was like--


43
0:1:57,85 --> 0:2:0,79
just how good the suit was, I
was just like, this film is


44
0:2:0,79 --> 0:2:2,85
going to work because
of the suit.


45
0:2:2,85 --> 0:2:6,6
But again, with the tying them
together, I like the idea that


46
0:2:6,6 --> 0:2:9,63
the quote comes from something
that Jill says in "Spider." As


47
0:2:9,63 --> 0:2:13,46
much as I wanted it to be a
standalone film, I wanted to


48
0:2:13,46 --> 0:2:15,6
tie into "Spider" as well.


49
0:2:15,6 --> 0:2:20,29
So the fact that Jack is taking
a needle to the eye, I


50
0:2:20,29 --> 0:2:23,13
wanted to show some sort
of remnants of that.


51
0:2:23,13 --> 0:2:27,51
And so for people who notice
that he had one discolored


52
0:2:27,51 --> 0:2:29,85
eye-- so Jack now has
one brown eye and


53
0:2:29,85 --> 0:2:31,5
one gray-blue eye.


54
0:2:31,5 --> 0:2:33,21
There's another nod to "Spider"
in here which is a


55
0:2:33,21 --> 0:2:35,88
complete accident that people
think is set up.


56
0:2:35,88 --> 0:2:38,28
But on the end of the bed,
there's a t-shirt with a


57
0:2:38,28 --> 0:2:40,53
spider on it at the
start of film.


58
0:2:40,53 --> 0:2:44,28
And that just happened to be
there on that bed in that


59
0:2:44,28 --> 0:2:45,94
location when we started
filming.


60
0:2:45,94 --> 0:2:46,84
I actually thought
the production


61
0:2:46,84 --> 0:2:47,766
designer had put it there.


62
0:2:47,766 --> 0:2:49,15
And I was like, oh,
that's great.


63
0:2:49,15 --> 0:2:49,59
Where did you get that?


64
0:2:49,59 --> 0:2:52,422
And she's like, oh, that
was just there.

[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]


69
0:3:1,76 --> 0:3:5,84
"Bear" has a shot in it that a
lot of people it's the first


70
0:3:5,84 --> 0:3:8,56
they ask about is how
did you do the fall?


71
0:3:8,56 --> 0:3:9,33
The fall--


72
0:3:9,33 --> 0:3:10,83
I approached it a similar way.


73
0:3:10,83 --> 0:3:12,29
I did storyboards.


74
0:3:12,29 --> 0:3:15,27
And then I went out and shot
an animatic and had an


75
0:3:15,27 --> 0:3:17,79
approach on how I was going to
do it and then spoke to Mike


76
0:3:17,79 --> 0:3:21,94
Seymour who did the visual
effects on "Spider," and


77
0:3:21,94 --> 0:3:24,37
worked out a plan on how
we were going to do it.


78
0:3:24,37 --> 0:3:27,35
And this time, the fall--
again, it's made up of a


79
0:3:27,35 --> 0:3:28,34
number of shots.


80
0:3:28,34 --> 0:3:30,42
But there was no dummy
in this one.


81
0:3:30,42 --> 0:3:31,77
It's all real.


82
0:3:31,77 --> 0:3:35,75
We essentially set up a rig
like a flying fox from one


83
0:3:35,75 --> 0:3:39,0
tree to another over the cliff
and had her ride the push bike


84
0:3:39,0 --> 0:3:42,75
off the cliff and catch her
10 feet from the ground.


85
0:3:42,75 --> 0:3:45,61
In the shot, you get the camera
going over, the girl


86
0:3:45,61 --> 0:3:47,425
going over on the bike, and the
bike going all the way to


87
0:3:47,425 --> 0:3:48,16
the ground.


88
0:3:48,16 --> 0:3:52,47
Then we set the camera up
looking straight down and had


89
0:3:52,47 --> 0:3:56,83
the same girl without the wires
and rig jump from a


90
0:3:56,83 --> 0:3:59,375
lower ledge at about 10
feet to the ground.


91
0:3:59,375 --> 0:4:2,63
And we dug up the dirt and
put a mat underneath.


92
0:4:2,63 --> 0:4:4,78
So then she could
do the landing.


93
0:4:4,78 --> 0:4:7,6
We showed her the take we liked
best and got her to get


94
0:4:7,6 --> 0:4:9,94
the same body position
as she jumped off to


95
0:4:9,94 --> 0:4:12,64
get the impact point.


96
0:4:12,64 --> 0:4:15,44
And then Mike just joined the
two shots together and removed


97
0:4:15,44 --> 0:4:20,12
the wires and ropes to give,
again, in one shot, the


98
0:4:20,12 --> 0:4:22,74
feeling of someone riding off
the cliff and going all the


99
0:4:22,74 --> 0:4:23,38
way to the ground.

0:4:25,4 --> 0:4:26,18
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]


103
0:4:26,18 --> 0:4:28,9
The reaction it gets from the
audience comes from--


104
0:4:28,9 --> 0:4:31,12
most people are used to seeing
shots like that.


105
0:4:31,12 --> 0:4:33,24
But it usually cuts out
to another angle.


106
0:4:33,24 --> 0:4:35,788



107
0:4:35,788 --> 0:4:38,225
They don't expect it to go all
the way to the ground, which


108
0:4:38,225 --> 0:4:39,475
was the effect I wanted.


109
0:4:39,475 --> 0:6:39,475
