###0 Hello, my name is Andrew WK.
###2 And I'm joining you from the Vice offices this holiday
###5 season with my wonderful friend Lil Bub to appeal to
###10 your sense of kindness and generosity.
###14 Now Lil Bub, of course, is a star cat.
###18 For many of her fans, Lil Bub's face and demeanor
###22 represent kindness and positivity
###24 in the face of adversity.
###27 She also snorted a few times in reverse.
###30 Why would you do that?
###32 
###35 Now we all understand that the winter holiday season is one
###39 of the most fun times to party.
###41 And in that spirit of inclusion and warmth, we ask
###45 you to donate to your local animal shelter
###48 this holiday season.
###50 [SINGING]
###50 I'm dreaming of a white Christian.
###57 As precious as Lil Bub is, she takes a lot of care, a lot of
###61 resources, and a lot of energy.
###63 So find it in your heart to donate, have a happy holiday,
###67 and enjoy the preciousness of this beast.
###72 How do you even exist?
###74 How tender is your paw?
###76 
###81 Lil Bub.
