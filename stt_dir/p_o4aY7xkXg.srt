0:0:2,95 --> 0:0:7,16
We're all familiar with gravity as "the reason
objects fall", but there's much, much more


2
0:0:7,16 --> 0:0:9,349
to gravity than that.


3
0:0:9,349 --> 0:0:12,889
Gravity is a long range attractive force between
all objects with mass:


4
0:0:12,889 --> 0:0:16,12
it's what keeps us from falling off the earth,
it's what keeps the earth in orbit around


5
0:0:16,12 --> 0:0:20,8
the sun, and it's what caused the sun itself
to form four and a half billion years ago!


6
0:0:20,8 --> 0:0:24,39
It's amazing to think that every massive object
attracts every other in the universe –


7
0:0:24,39 --> 0:0:28,94
that means that your dog, the earth,
and a black hole in the Andromeda galaxy 2.5


8
0:0:28,94 --> 0:0:32,93
million light years away
are all gravitationally attracted to you,


9
0:0:32,93 --> 0:0:34,2
and you to them.


10
0:0:34,2 --> 0:0:38,5
In the 17th century, Isaac Newton discovered
that the strength of the gravitational force


11
0:0:38,5 --> 0:0:42,72
decreases by the square of the distance between
two objects – so if you're twice as far


12
0:0:42,72 --> 0:0:47,51
away, gravity is only one fourth as strong!
He also discovered that the strength of gravity


13
0:0:47,51 --> 0:0:52,35
is proportional to the mass of the objects
in question: the more massive an object, the


14
0:0:52,35 --> 0:0:56,87
stronger the gravitational force. That's why
we can all feel the Earth pulling on us, but


15
0:0:56,87 --> 0:1:1,579
don't really notice the pull of the moon – it's
smaller, and farther away! (the moon's gravity


16
0:1:1,579 --> 0:1:4,39
is strong enough to cause the tides, though!)


17
0:1:4,39 --> 0:1:8,409
And when I said earlier that gravity is an
attraction between objects with mass, I lied.


18
0:1:8,409 --> 0:1:13,329
I meant objects with Energy. Because in addition
to massive objects, gravity also attracts


19
0:1:13,329 --> 0:1:17,77
light and other massless (but energetic) particles,
so that a photon of light can be bent slightly


20
0:1:17,77 --> 0:1:21,81
passing the sun, or trapped completely by
a black hole.


21
0:1:21,81 --> 0:3:21,81
Now do you understand the Gravity of the situation?
