>> DRUMMOND: Another great day at Google.
So I want to welcome everybody to the latest


2
0:0:11,67 --> 0:0:16,15
installment of Candidates at Google. For those
of you who don't know me, I'm David Drummond,


3
0:0:16,15 --> 0:0:22,589
Senior Vice President of Corporate Development,
the company's Chief Legal Officer. I'm very


4
0:0:22,589 --> 0:0:33,57
pleased and distinctly honored here to welcome
back to Google Senator Barack Obama. I say


5
0:0:33,57 --> 0:0:38,3
welcome back because for those of you who
were around in the summer of 2004, you may


6
0:0:38,3 --> 0:0:44,53
remember at TGIF in which I joined Larry and
Sergey on this stage and introduced to the


7
0:0:44,53 --> 0:0:51,86
assembled Googlers then senate candidate Obama.
And Barack had been in the Bay Area and he


8
0:0:51,86 --> 0:0:56,4
wanted to come down and see what we were up
to here at Google, see what this Google thing


9
0:0:56,4 --> 0:1:1,489
was all about. And he had a great visit. He
came and did the tour. He saw the GeoDisplay,


10
0:1:1,489 --> 0:1:7,56
the Search Traffic, and he saw the servers,
and everything we had at Google. We sat down


11
0:1:7,56 --> 0:1:12,869
with Larry and Sergey. We had a great talk
about innovation, about policy, and he later


12
0:1:12,869 --> 0:1:19,259
wrote about that in his book, The Audacity
of Hope. And I know all of you have a copy


13
0:1:19,259 --> 0:1:25,46
of that. And all in all a great visit. And,
you know, while it was a fantastic visit,


14
0:1:25,46 --> 0:1:32,859
I now realized that we made a grave error
that day at TGI, we didn't let him speak.


15
0:1:32,859 --> 0:1:40,859
So, ladies and gentlemen, today, we are going
to rectify that error. We are thrilled that


16
0:1:40,859 --> 0:1:46,939
Senator Obama has chosen Google to unveil
his innovation agenda. And you're going to


17
0:1:46,939 --> 0:1:53,67
hear that today and we're very, very excited
about what that means for the country and


18
0:1:53,67 --> 0:2:1,329
I think you will be too. Following that, Eric's
going to come up on the stage and do a Q&A


19
0:2:1,329 --> 0:2:5,609
with Senator Obama. And following that, you'll
have your chance to ask your question. So,


20
0:2:5,609 --> 0:2:12,11
without anything further, please join me in
giving an enormous Google welcome back to


21
0:2:12,11 --> 0:2:47,72
Senator Barack Obama. Thanks.
>> OBAMA: Thank you. Thank you. Thank you,


22
0:2:47,72 --> 0:2:52,0
every body. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you
so much. What a--what a wonderful reception.


23
0:2:52,0 --> 0:2:58,7
I am so grateful to all of you for showing
such interest in taking the time to be here


24
0:2:58,7 --> 0:3:7,3
today. I want to thank Larry and Sergey and
Eric and, obviously, David for helping to


25
0:3:7,3 --> 0:3:13,69
set this up. I am extremely grateful to all
of them for their leadership and their friendship.


26
0:3:13,69 --> 0:3:19,1
And I also want to acknowledge state Senator
Elaine Alquist who is here. This is her district,


27
0:3:19,1 --> 0:3:24,11
and since I used to be a state senator I always
want to give her, her props, so it's wonderful


28
0:3:24,11 --> 0:3:35,62
to see her as well. So, thank you. Well, it
is wonderful to be back. As David said I was


29
0:3:35,62 --> 0:3:42,68
here about 3 years ago and had just a wonderful
visit. It was such a striking visit for me.


30
0:3:42,68 --> 0:3:47,73
It made such an impression that I ended up
writing about it in my book. And so it's always


31
0:3:47,73 --> 0:3:52,32
good to be back in Mountain View and it's
good to see that Google is maintaining its


32
0:3:52,32 --> 0:3:58,97
strict dress code.


33
0:3:58,97 --> 0:4:5,19
When you stop to think about it, there is
something improbable about this gathering.


34
0:4:5,19 --> 0:4:13,51
After all it wasn't much more than a decade
ago that Larry and Sergey got together in


35
0:4:13,51 --> 0:4:19,91
a dorm room as graduate students, with a big
idea to organize all of the world's information


36
0:4:19,91 --> 0:4:25,6
into an accessible form. And at that time,
I was an Illinois state senator doing my best


37
0:4:25,6 --> 0:4:32,76
to help people get a better shot at their
dreams. What we shared is a belief in changing


38
0:4:32,76 --> 0:4:40,25
the world from the bottom-up, not the top-down.
That a bunch of--that ordinary people can


39
0:4:40,25 --> 0:4:46,3
do extraordinary things. We shared that. We
also shared a bunch of student loans that


40
0:4:46,3 --> 0:4:53,13
still needed to be paid off. And you would
have found it hard to predict that Larry and


41
0:4:53,13 --> 0:4:57,27
Sergey would now be the co-founders of one
of the most successful companies in recent


42
0:4:57,27 --> 0:5:3,94
history and that I would be standing on this
stage today as a candidate for president of


43
0:5:3,94 --> 0:5:12,12
the United States. But this is where improbable
journeys have led. This is where the moment


44
0:5:12,12 --> 0:5:18,4
finds us. And I'd like to say a few words
about what I believe we have to do together,


45
0:5:18,4 --> 0:5:25,23
to seize this moment with a sense of purpose
and a sense of urgency. We know how the first


46
0:5:25,23 --> 0:5:31,59
chapters of the Google story have turned out.
After all, all of you have good jobs. But


47
0:5:31,59 --> 0:5:38,51
we also know that the Google story is more
than just being about the bottom line. It's


48
0:5:38,51 --> 0:5:43,419
about seeing what we can accomplish when we
believe in things that are unseen, when we


49
0:5:43,419 --> 0:5:48,82
take the measure of our changing times and
we take action to shape them. And that's why


50
0:5:48,82 --> 0:5:56,4
we're here today, that's why many of you decided
to work here instead of someplace else. Technology


51
0:5:56,4 --> 0:6:2,98
and innovation have reshaped our economy and
our lives at breathtaking speed. America's


52
0:6:2,98 --> 0:6:9,919
been fighting to figure out how to tap this
awesome new resource that we have, and Google


53
0:6:9,919 --> 0:6:15,169
has helped to show us the way. But the story
is far from over. Google’s story is far


54
0:6:15,169 --> 0:6:21,44
from over. The story of how we shaped our
changing times is far from over. What comes


55
0:6:21,44 --> 0:6:28,699
next depends on the choices that we make right
now, at this moment, in this election. We


56
0:6:28,699 --> 0:6:36,9
could see the spirit of innovation that started
this company be stifled. We could see the


57
0:6:36,9 --> 0:6:41,69
internet divided up to the highest bidders.
We could see a government that uses technology


58
0:6:41,69 --> 0:6:48,36
to shut people out, instead of letting them
in. Tax break shuffled to special interests


59
0:6:48,36 --> 0:6:54,729
while the next start-up, the next Google can't
get a fair shot. Challenges like healthcare


60
0:6:54,729 --> 0:7:1,71
and energy that hold our country back while
competition from other nations picks up. That's


61
0:7:1,71 --> 0:7:8,36
one alternative. Another alternative is for
us to unlock a new future of opportunity.


62
0:7:8,36 --> 0:7:14,36
Together we could open up the government and
invite all citizens in while connecting all


63
0:7:14,36 --> 0:7:21,54
of America to 21st century Broadband. We could
use technology to help achieve universal healthcare,


64
0:7:21,54 --> 0:7:27,21
to reach for a clean energy future, and to
ensure that young Americans can compete and


65
0:7:27,21 --> 0:7:35,63
win in the global economy. If America recommits
itself to science and innovation, then we


66
0:7:35,63 --> 0:7:41,69
can lead the world to a new future of productivity
and prosperity. That's what we can do if we


67
0:7:41,69 --> 0:7:48,74
seize this moment. That's the choice we face.
And as president, I intend to work with you


68
0:7:48,74 --> 0:7:54,52
to write the next chapter in the story of
American innovation. That's part of the reason


69
0:7:54,52 --> 0:8:0,35
why I'm running for president of the United
States. To seize this moment, we have to ensure


70
0:8:0,35 --> 0:8:7,78
free and full exchange of information, and
that starts with an open internet. I will


71
0:8:7,78 --> 0:8:16,53
take--I


72
0:8:16,53 --> 0:8:23,56
will take a backseat to no one in my commitment
to network neutrality, because once providers


73
0:8:23,56 --> 0:8:29,56
start to privilege some applications or websites
over others, then the smaller voices get squeezed


74
0:8:29,56 --> 0:8:35,399
out and we all lose. The internet is perhaps
the most open network in history and we have


75
0:8:35,399 --> 0:8:41,26
to keep it that way. To seize this moment,
we have to connect all of America to 21st


76
0:8:41,26 --> 0:8:47,31
century infrastructure. As president, I will
set a goal of ensuring that every American


77
0:8:47,31 --> 0:8:52,48
has Broadband access, no matter where you
live, no matter how much money you have or


78
0:8:52,48 --> 0:8:58,7
don't have. We will raise the standards for
Broadband speed. We will connect schools and


79
0:8:58,7 --> 0:9:2,96
libraries and hospitals. And we’ll take
on the special interest so that we can finally


80
0:9:2,96 --> 0:9:10,3
unleash the power of wireless spectrum for
our safety, our security, and our connectivity.


81
0:9:10,3 --> 0:9:17,1
To seize this moment, we have to use technology
to open up our democracy. It's no coincidence


82
0:9:17,1 --> 0:9:22,32
that one of the most secretive administrations
in our history, has favored special interests


83
0:9:22,32 --> 0:9:27,6
and pursued policies that could not stand
up to the sunlight. As president, I'm going


84
0:9:27,6 --> 0:9:34,27
to change that. We will put government data
online in universally accessible formats.


85
0:9:34,27 --> 0:9:46,93
I'll let citizens--I'll let citizens check
federal grants, contracts, earmarks, and lobbying


86
0:9:46,93 --> 0:9:53,31
contracts. I'll let you participate in government
forums, ask questions in real time, offer


87
0:9:53,31 --> 0:10:0,95
suggestions that will be reviewed before decisions
are made, and let you comment on legislation


88
0:10:0,95 --> 0:10:6,19
before it is signed. And to ensure that every
government agency is meeting 21st century


89
0:10:6,19 --> 0:10:11,81
standards, I will appoint the nation's first
chief technology officer to coordinate and


90
0:10:11,81 --> 0:10:15,88
make certain that we are always at the forefront
of technology and that we are incorporating


91
0:10:15,88 --> 0:10:29,27
it into every decision that we make. And if
you want to know how I'll govern, just look


92
0:10:29,27 --> 0:10:38,87
at our campaign. We’ve received over 370,000
donations online, half of which have been


93
0:10:38,87 --> 0:10:48,33
under $25. Nearly 300,000 Americans have their
own accounts on BarackObama.com. They’ve


94
0:10:48,33 --> 0:10:56,16
created—they’ve created thousands of grassroots
groups. They've offered up over 15,000 policy


95
0:10:56,16 --> 0:11:2,62
ideas, because we believe the real change
can only come from the bottom-up, and technology


96
0:11:2,62 --> 0:11:8,58
empowers people to come together to make that
change. Because at this moment, I think we


97
0:11:8,58 --> 0:11:13,5
have to do more than to get our house in order,
the opportunity in front of us is bigger than


98
0:11:13,5 --> 0:11:18,25
that. Seizing this opportunity is going to
depend on more than what the government does


99
0:11:18,25 --> 0:11:23,86
or even what the technology sector does. It's
going to depend on how together we harness


100
0:11:23,86 --> 0:11:29,61
technology to confront the biggest challenges
that America faces. Just imagine what we could


101
0:11:29,61 --> 0:11:34,99
do. If we commit ourselves to electronic medical
records, then we can lift up the quality of


102
0:11:34,99 --> 0:11:45,39
healthcare and reduce error and dramatically
lower costs. If we take on--if we take on


103
0:11:45,39 --> 0:11:50,649
special interests and make aggressive investments
and clean a renewable energy like Google has


104
0:11:50,649 --> 0:11:56,44
done with solar here in Mountainview, that
we can end our addiction to ore, create millions


105
0:11:56,44 --> 0:12:2,74
of jobs and save the planet in the bargain.
If we make technological literacy a fundamental


106
0:12:2,74 --> 0:12:7,839
part of education then we can give our children
the skills they need to compete and ensure


107
0:12:7,839 --> 0:12:15,0
the next generation of scientists and engineers
as being educated right here in America. We


108
0:12:15,0 --> 0:12:21,73
can do this, but we can't wait because Silicon
Valley is not the only corner of innovation


109
0:12:21,73 --> 0:12:27,57
in the world. If America doesn't seize this
moment, then we will face only more competition


110
0:12:27,57 --> 0:12:35,279
from Dubai and Dublin, from Shanghai and Mumbai.
So, instead of George Bush's policy of undermining


111
0:12:35,279 --> 0:12:41,91
science, I intend to double federal funding
for basic research and make the R&D tax credit


112
0:12:41,91 --> 0:12:53,39
permanent. To keep--to keep the door open
for the next generation of start-ups, I'll


113
0:12:53,39 --> 0:12:59,62
enforce tough anti-trust laws, and to ensure
that America continues to track the world's


114
0:12:59,62 --> 0:13:5,12
best and brightest, we need comprehensive
immigration reform that strengthens permanent


115
0:13:5,12 --> 0:13:18,959
resident visas like the H-1B program. We need
to make sure that the next success story,


116
0:13:18,959 --> 0:13:25,87
the next Google, happens here in America.
The Google stories about what can be achieved


117
0:13:25,87 --> 0:13:32,0
when we cultivate new ideas and keep the playing
field level for new businesses. But it's also


118
0:13:32,0 --> 0:13:37,11
about not settling for what we've already
achieved, it's about constantly raising the


119
0:13:37,11 --> 0:13:42,95
bar so that we're more competitive. And so
we use technology to reach ever expanding


120
0:13:42,95 --> 0:13:50,93
horizons. You know, the first time I was back
here in 2004, Larry showed me the image that


121
0:13:50,93 --> 0:13:56,51
tracks all the internet searches taking place
in the world. I wrote about this in my book.


122
0:13:56,51 --> 0:14:2,93
And I saw the earth rotating on a flat panel
monitor with the different lights for different


123
0:14:2,93 --> 0:14:7,829
languages marking all the traffic on this
wondrous network, the network that didn't


124
0:14:7,829 --> 0:14:19,269
even exist when almost all of us here were
born, almost. But what struck me wasn't the


125
0:14:19,269 --> 0:14:28,329
light on that globe; it was the darkness.
Most of Africa, chunks of Asia, even parts


126
0:14:28,329 --> 0:14:35,89
of the United States, the disconnected corners
of our interconnected world where the promise


127
0:14:35,89 --> 0:14:42,98
of the 21st century is being eclipsed by peril.
You and I must not settle for anything less


128
0:14:42,98 --> 0:14:48,57
than an America that replaces that darkness
with a new light, because the promise and


129
0:14:48,57 --> 0:14:54,209
prosperity of the new economy must not be
the property of the few. It must be a force


130
0:14:54,209 --> 0:15:10,579
that lifts up our entire country and ultimately
lifts up the entire world.
We have the privilege to live in a transformational


131
0:15:10,579 --> 0:15:17,68
moment, a moment when an idea can change the
world, a moment when technology empowers us


132
0:15:17,68 --> 0:15:24,519
to come together as never before while letting
each of us reach for our own individual dreams,


133
0:15:24,519 --> 0:15:29,89
a moment when we can finally progress and
move beyond the huge challenges that have


134
0:15:29,89 --> 0:15:38,42
stood in the way of progress for far too long.
We cannot and we must not look back and regret


135
0:15:38,42 --> 0:15:43,86
that we settled for anything less. And that's
why I'm asking you to join me in seizing this


136
0:15:43,86 --> 0:15:48,86
moment, I'm asking you to join me in changing
the world. Thank you very much everybody.


137
0:15:48,86 --> 0:16:13,459
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.
Eric, come on up. Thank you.


138
0:16:13,459 --> 0:16:13,459
>> SCHMIDT: Brilliant. Brilliant.
>> OBAMA: Thank you so much.


139
0:16:13,459 --> 0:16:15,779
>> SCHMIDT: Thank--thank you, Senator, for
such a strong message about innovation.


140
0:16:15,779 --> 0:16:20,4
>> OBAMA: Thank you.
>> SCHMIDT: Senator Obama, the product of


141
0:16:20,4 --> 0:16:28,6
a Kansas mother and a father from Kenya, born
in Hawaii; your history, of course, Columbia,


142
0:16:28,6 --> 0:16:33,85
Harvard, state senator, now, senator running
for president, welcome to Google.


143
0:16:33,85 --> 0:16:44,32
>> OBAMA: Thank you so much. Thank you.
>> SCHMIDT: When you see yourself in the presidency


144
0:16:44,32 --> 0:16:53,139
in 2008, 2009, and for many years, what is
it that you're going to do that's exceptional?


145
0:16:53,139 --> 0:16:57,279
What is your fundamental reason why you think
this company--this country, excuse me, is


146
0:16:57,279 --> 0:17:6,4
going to be--is going to be a great country?
And by the way...


147
0:17:6,4 --> 0:17:10,38
>> OBAMA: Is this the kind of interview that
you guys want too?


148
0:17:10,38 --> 0:17:15,93
>> SCHMIDT: And your book is really extraordinary,
its title is The Audacity of Hope.


149
0:17:15,93 --> 0:17:21,63
>> OBAMA: Yeah. Well, Eric, first of all,
thanks, thanks for letting me be here, and


150
0:17:21,63 --> 0:17:27,62
the reason that book is called The Audacity
of Hope is it captures an idea that got me


151
0:17:27,62 --> 0:17:33,78
into politics in the first place, which is
that part of what has been great about America


152
0:17:33,78 --> 0:17:41,9
is there’s a certain audacious quality,
this belief that this ragtag bunch of revolutionaries


153
0:17:41,9 --> 0:17:47,12
can overthrow the greatest empire on earth,
start a government that we've never seen operate


154
0:17:47,12 --> 0:17:54,2
before, spread across the continent, create
the greatest economy and the greatest democracy


155
0:17:54,2 --> 0:18:2,549
in our history, and then overcome barriers,
both internal and external that would prevent


156
0:18:2,549 --> 0:18:7,419
us from making progress. There's a certain
confidence and boldness to the idea of America.


157
0:18:7,419 --> 0:18:14,29
And the reason I'm running for president right
now, because oftentimes people ask me, "Why


158
0:18:14,29 --> 0:18:21,37
now?" You know, if I waited 10 years, I'd
be still younger than most of the other candidates,


159
0:18:21,37 --> 0:18:33,15
that's true. It is because I think we are
at a defining moment in our history, our nation


160
0:18:33,15 --> 0:18:40,28
is at war, the planet is in peril, ordinary
Americans are working harder for less. They


161
0:18:40,28 --> 0:18:46,6
feel as if the dream that generations fought
for is slowly slipping away. There are costs


162
0:18:46,6 --> 0:18:54,13
for everything, from healthcare to college
have gone up. They're finding it more difficult


163
0:18:54,13 --> 0:18:58,91
to save, difficult to retire, and they don't
feel as if anybody in Washington is listening


164
0:18:58,91 --> 0:19:3,57
to them. And when I made the decision, I sat
down with my wife, and I asked myself three


165
0:19:3,57 --> 0:19:9,74
questions: One, could my family survive the
rigors of presidential campaign? And because


166
0:19:9,74 --> 0:19:13,57
my wife is exceptional and my children are
above average, we figured we could do it,


167
0:19:13,57 --> 0:19:22,75
and they’ve been great. That's also true.
The second question we asked was, "Could we


168
0:19:22,75 --> 0:19:26,15
win?" And we determined that we could. But
the third question was, I asked myself the


169
0:19:26,15 --> 0:19:31,5
question you asked, because I think so much
is at stake right now that running for president


170
0:19:31,5 --> 0:19:36,23
can't be about just ambition this time, there's
got to be a rationale. And what I concluded


171
0:19:36,23 --> 0:19:42,53
is this; I believe I can more effectively
bring this country together to solve problems


172
0:19:42,53 --> 0:19:50,46
than on the other candidate. And, yeah, we
have seen a gridlock where 45% of the country


173
0:19:50,46 --> 0:19:54,65
is on one side, 45% of the country is on the
other, we've got 10% in the middle, they all


174
0:19:54,65 --> 0:20:2,85
live in Ohio and Florida apparently, and so,
political contest just become beating down


175
0:20:2,85 --> 0:20:8,789
the other side and eking out of victory one
way or the other, but you can't govern. And


176
0:20:8,789 --> 0:20:14,23
the problems we face, whether it's climate
change or healthcare or our standing in the


177
0:20:14,23 --> 0:20:19,9
world are so enormous that we have to govern,
we have to make good decisions, so that's


178
0:20:19,9 --> 0:20:30,19
number one. Number two, is I--I have taken
on the special interest in the past and of


179
0:20:30,19 --> 0:20:35,78
one and I've got an instinct of bias to push
against the status quo, which I think is really


180
0:20:35,78 --> 0:20:40,97
needed right now because Washington has become
captive of special interest that are making


181
0:20:40,97 --> 0:20:46,929
decisions not based on reason, not based on
competition, not based on innovation, but


182
0:20:46,929 --> 0:20:51,77
all too often based on who's got the most
juice, who's got the most clout, and that


183
0:20:51,77 --> 0:21:2,16
has to change. And the third--the third thing
and this is the last thing is--you mentioned


184
0:21:2,16 --> 0:21:13,45
in my background--I was shaped by a new global
perspective. I grew up in Hawaii. I lived


185
0:21:13,45 --> 0:21:21,7
in Indonesia. I have family all around the
globe. And the damage that's been done over


186
0:21:21,7 --> 0:21:29,8
the last seven years and outstanding in the
world is so significant that we have to have


187
0:21:29,8 --> 0:21:35,72
the next president engage in a level of personal
presidential diplomacy that I think is unmatched


188
0:21:35,72 --> 0:21:41,61
at least since World War II. And I believe
that the day I'm inaugurated, the--not only


189
0:21:41,61 --> 0:21:45,41
does the country look at itself differently
but the world looks at America differently.


190
0:21:45,41 --> 0:21:52,82
And I'm able to go to Africa and speak to
them about development and problems of corruption


191
0:21:52,82 --> 0:21:58,94
and our obligations towards that continent,
and I could say--I've got a grandmother in


192
0:21:58,94 --> 0:22:5,38
a small African village without electricity
or running water. So I have a little credibility


193
0:22:5,38 --> 0:22:10,76
that no other president could match. If I
go to a Muslim leader, I can speak to them


194
0:22:10,76 --> 0:22:15,69
and I can say, "I am a Christian but I live
in the country with the largest Muslim population


195
0:22:15,69 --> 0:22:22,97
in the world. And so, I don't assume a clash
of civilizations. I think that there's something


196
0:22:22,97 --> 0:22:27,52
we have in common that we can potentially
build on. And I have a level of credibility


197
0:22:27,52 --> 0:22:32,11
that no other president has. That I think
is what's going to be necessary to lead us


198
0:22:32,11 --> 0:22:52,4
out of the problems that we're in right now.
>> SCHMIDT: You know--well. Now, Senator,


199
0:22:52,4 --> 0:22:59,98
you're here at Google and I like to think
of the presidency as a job interview. Now,


200
0:22:59,98 --> 0:23:2,23
it's hard to get a job...
>> OBAMA: Right.


201
0:23:2,23 --> 0:23:3,37
>> SCHMIDT: As president...
>> OBAMA: Right.


202
0:23:3,37 --> 0:23:6,14
>> SCHMIDT: And--I mean, you're going to do
a great job. It's also hard to get a job at


203
0:23:6,14 --> 0:23:7,88
Google.
>> OBAMA: Right.


204
0:23:7,88 --> 0:23:13,62
>> SCHMIDT: We have questions and we ask our
candidates questions. And this one is from


205
0:23:13,62 --> 0:23:13,83
Larry Schwimmer.
>> OBAMA: Okay.


206
0:23:13,83 --> 0:23:22,679
>> SCHMIDT: What--you guys think I'm kidding,
it's right here. What is the most efficient


207
0:23:22,679 --> 0:23:29,169
way to sort a million 32-bit integers?
>> OBAMA: Well...


208
0:23:29,169 --> 0:23:33,73
>> SCHMIDT: Maybe--I'm sorry...
>> OBAMA: No, no, no, no. I think--I think


209
0:23:33,73 --> 0:23:39,32
the bubble sort would be the wrong way to
go.


210
0:23:39,32 --> 0:23:47,59
>> SCHMIDT: Come on. Who told him this? Okay.
I didn't see computer science in your background.


211
0:23:47,59 --> 0:23:53,419
>> OBAMA: We've got our spies in there.
>> SCHMIDT: Well, why not--okay, let's ask


212
0:23:53,419 --> 0:24:6,58
a different interview question. Well, obviously,
more serious. You're notable in this campaign


213
0:24:6,58 --> 0:24:11,25
for your steadfast opposition to the Iraq
War.


214
0:24:11,25 --> 0:24:14,12
>> OBAMA: Right.
>> SCHMIDT: On the assumption that you're


215
0:24:14,12 --> 0:24:15,179
elected president on day one, you'll walk
in...


216
0:24:15,179 --> 0:24:16,62
>> OBAMA: Yeah.
>> SCHMIDT: And the war will probably still


217
0:24:16,62 --> 0:24:18,249
be on.
>> OBAMA: Yeah.


218
0:24:18,249 --> 0:24:21,42
>> SCHMIDT: And we know your view that the
war was a mistake.


219
0:24:21,42 --> 0:24:23,179
>> OBAMA: Right.
>> SCHMIDT: But here it is, you're at the


220
0:24:23,179 --> 0:24:28,809
desk, what are you going to do?
>> OBAMA: We will call in--I will call in


221
0:24:28,809 --> 0:24:35,82
the Joint Chief of Staff, my Secretary Of
State Nominee, my National Security Advisor


222
0:24:35,82 --> 0:24:45,74
Nominee, and they will have a new mission,
which is to end this war. And it appears based


223
0:24:45,74 --> 0:24:50,84
on the advice that I've gotten from military
commanders that we can safely bring out one


224
0:24:50,84 --> 0:24:57,58
to two brigades per month. At that phase,
we will have our combat troops out in sixteen


225
0:24:57,58 --> 0:25:6,11
months. The only mission--we will not have
permanent basis in Iraq and we will not have


226
0:25:6,11 --> 0:25:14,44
combat operations in Iraq. The only mission
that I will allow will be to protect our embassy


227
0:25:14,44 --> 0:25:23,49
and our civilian personnel, diplomats, humanitarian
workers and we will have a narrowly targeted


228
0:25:23,49 --> 0:25:30,289
mission of if there are terrorist camps that
are amassing in Iraq that we have a strike


229
0:25:30,289 --> 0:25:37,71
capability. Now, it is important during those
16 months that we are redoubling our diplomatic


230
0:25:37,71 --> 0:25:43,289
efforts. The reason that it is so important,
I believe, to start getting our troops out


231
0:25:43,289 --> 0:25:50,89
is because the Iraqi government has declined
to negotiate with the various factions. The


232
0:25:50,89 --> 0:25:55,25
Sunnis, the Shiites, the Kurds have not come
together and arrive at the political accommodations


233
0:25:55,25 --> 0:26:1,13
that are necessary to solve this problem.
And we have not reached out to the regional


234
0:26:1,13 --> 0:26:8,71
powers including Iran, Syria--so not just
our friends, but also our enemies to arrive


235
0:26:8,71 --> 0:26:14,22
at a workable and stable Iraq. And this is
an argument that I've had with some of the


236
0:26:14,22 --> 0:26:18,809
other candidates, including Senator Clinton
in this race. And I think it's part of what


237
0:26:18,809 --> 0:26:26,919
signals a break from Bush-Cheney diplomacy;
the willingness to speak to our adversaries.


238
0:26:26,919 --> 0:26:30,159
President Kennedy once said, "We should never
negotiate out of fear, but we should never


239
0:26:30,159 --> 0:26:35,86
fear to negotiate." And the notion that not
talking to leaders we don't like makes us


240
0:26:35,86 --> 0:26:41,15
look tough is fundamentally flawed. It makes
us look arrogant and it sends a message to


241
0:26:41,15 --> 0:26:48,88
the world that we're not listening. And if
we change our diplomatic approach led by me,


242
0:26:48,88 --> 0:26:55,669
the president of the United States, that I
think will allow us to shift not just the


243
0:26:55,669 --> 0:27:1,409
situation in Iraq but change the climate in
the Middle East around the world. It will


244
0:27:1,409 --> 0:27:7,25
give us more leverage then to deal with terrorist
activity that's taking place in Afghanistan,


245
0:27:7,25 --> 0:27:12,85
in the border areas around Pakistan and elsewhere
in the region.


246
0:27:12,85 --> 0:27:18,78
>> SCHMIDT: Let's ask about--let's ask about
Iran, Guantanamo...


247
0:27:18,78 --> 0:27:26,59
>> OBAMA: Right.
>> SCHMIDT: Pakistan, give us your sense as


248
0:27:26,59 --> 0:27:30,11
leader what you would do with all of these
issues.


249
0:27:30,11 --> 0:27:38,52
>> OBAMA: I will talk to Iran directly. That
does not mean that we will be conceding any


250
0:27:38,52 --> 0:27:44,909
positions with Iran. It means that we will
listen and see where we can find common ground.


251
0:27:44,909 --> 0:27:51,48
I think Iran is a grave threat to security.
If they develop nuclear weapons, they could


252
0:27:51,48 --> 0:27:57,15
trigger another arms race in the Middle East.
It is indisputable that they have assisted


253
0:27:57,15 --> 0:28:2,98
Hezbollah and Hamas in terrorist activity
and--you know, their language, when it comes


254
0:28:2,98 --> 0:28:11,73
to Israel is unacceptable. But what is also
true is that we have repeatedly rebuffed gestures


255
0:28:11,73 --> 0:28:17,299
that might allow for some resolution of these
conflicts in a non-military way. And so, for


256
0:28:17,299 --> 0:28:22,409
us to say to them, "You stand out on the nuclear
issue and you may be able to join the World


257
0:28:22,409 --> 0:28:31,289
Trade organization. You stop supporting terrorist
activity; we are in a position to start normalizing


258
0:28:31,289 --> 0:28:39,9
relations." Having those conversations face-to-face
are important. Not--it may be that Ahmadinejad


259
0:28:39,9 --> 0:28:46,94
rejects it, but it will send a message to
Iranian people that they are not our enemy


260
0:28:46,94 --> 0:28:51,57
and it sends a message around the world that
we are doing business differently. Sarkozy,


261
0:28:51,57 --> 0:28:56,409
President Sarkozy, I know you just met with
him, Eric. He was quoted in the New Yorker


262
0:28:56,409 --> 0:29:2,83
a while back, and he said--he was asked what's
the most important thing America could do


263
0:29:2,83 --> 0:29:11,539
to help you, and he said, "Be more liked."
Be more liked. You know, and he wasn't joking


264
0:29:11,539 --> 0:29:17,58
because when our standing is low, it gives
us less leverage. We can't negotiate and maneuver.


265
0:29:17,58 --> 0:29:22,69
Many people are concerned probably here about
the genocide in Darfur. We would be in such


266
0:29:22,69 --> 0:29:27,34
a stronger position to ensure there was a
protective force on the ground and to save


267
0:29:27,34 --> 0:29:36,2
people's lives if we had more credibility
and more trust so that people--so that the


268
0:29:36,2 --> 0:29:39,7
Khartoum government couldn't say that, "Oh,
we're just trying to invade another Muslim


269
0:29:39,7 --> 0:29:52,39
country." So that's on Iran. Pakistan--Pakistan
is in a difficult situation right now. And


270
0:29:52,39 --> 0:29:58,679
in some ways, we've got the worst of both
worlds; we’ve got a military ruler who has


271
0:29:58,679 --> 0:30:5,13
locked up political opposition and institute
an emergency rule. So he's violating human


272
0:30:5,13 --> 0:30:12,659
rights in Pakistan and he also has not dealt
with terrorist activity inside his borders.


273
0:30:12,659 --> 0:30:18,14
We need to reverse course. I've already said
that we should suspend military that's not


274
0:30:18,14 --> 0:30:24,929
related to--directly to hunting down terrorists.
We should suspend that until military--emergency


275
0:30:24,929 --> 0:30:31,8
rule is lifted and prisoners were released
and they can proceed with what the Constitution


276
0:30:31,8 --> 0:30:39,26
of Pakistan has called for. This is a mistake
we repeatedly make. We think somehow and we


277
0:30:39,26 --> 0:30:45,32
made this all throughout the Cold War. We
think that by latching on to non-democratic


278
0:30:45,32 --> 0:30:51,46
authoritarian rule, we somehow contain--in
this case, Islamist extremism, it doesn’t


279
0:30:51,46 --> 0:30:59,429
contain as Islamist extremism. It makes people
believe that somehow the United States is


280
0:30:59,429 --> 0:31:4,69
opposed to their liberty, opposed to their
democracy. And that's not the side of history


281
0:31:4,69 --> 0:31:10,8
that we want to be on. Now, we have to make
sure that the nuclear weapons in Pakistan


282
0:31:10,8 --> 0:31:14,74
are secure. And that has to be our number
one priority and will be my number one priority


283
0:31:14,74 --> 0:31:21,39
as president. But understand Pakistan--the
democratic element in Pakistan, a big chunk


284
0:31:21,39 --> 0:31:28,789
of this movement is secular, it is middle-class.
And what they're seeking is for the kind of


285
0:31:28,789 --> 0:31:34,36
political liberty that we hope for. Last point,
Guantanamo, that's easy. We close down Guantanamo,


286
0:31:34,36 --> 0:31:49,19
restore Habeas Corpus, say no to renditions,
no to wireless wiretaps, you know, Part of


287
0:31:49,19 --> 0:31:55,58
my job as the next president is to break the
fever of fear that has been exploited by this


288
0:31:55,58 --> 0:32:5,99
administration, that--you know, we're told--you
know, we're told that we should be afraid


289
0:32:5,99 --> 0:32:17,0
of terrorists and immigrants and each other,
and it becomes the means by which our civil


290
0:32:17,0 --> 0:32:24,27
liberties are subverted, our values are distorted,
we start hearing our attorney general nominee


291
0:32:24,27 --> 0:32:31,539
not being certain as to whether simulated
drownings are torture. That's not who we are


292
0:32:31,539 --> 0:32:37,399
as Americans. And sometimes I’m accused
of being, you know, this progressive far--I'm


293
0:32:37,399 --> 0:32:44,32
conservative in a sense that I want us to
get back to those values that were essential


294
0:32:44,32 --> 0:32:56,779
to building America. Well....
>> SCHMIDT: The--let's talk a little about


295
0:32:56,779 --> 0:33:4,279
America, and the America that you see today
is one of extremes. And in your campaign,


296
0:33:4,279 --> 0:33:9,83
you've talked a lot about the people who are
not the--the economic winners, the educational


297
0:33:9,83 --> 0:33:15,309
winners, or whatever, and many people are
responding very strongly and positively to


298
0:33:15,309 --> 0:33:16,299
that message.
>> OBAMA: Right.


299
0:33:16,299 --> 0:33:21,649
>> SCHMIDT: Take us through what would be
different. What are you going to do, how are


300
0:33:21,649 --> 0:33:27,73
you going to deal with the very serious economic
problems, educational problems, a set of problems


301
0:33:27,73 --> 0:33:33,149
that we face here in the United States.
>> OBAMA: Well, let's start with acknowledging


302
0:33:33,149 --> 0:33:41,19
that our economy is out of balance. We have
seen extraordinary economic growth and, obviously,


303
0:33:41,19 --> 0:33:51,84
Google is a symbol of one sector of our economy
that's just been extraordinary; innovative,


304
0:33:51,84 --> 0:34:2,11
creative and lucrative, but there's a whole
another part of America that has been left


305
0:34:2,11 --> 0:34:8,75
behind. You know, if you look economically,
all the growth over the last two decades is


306
0:34:8,75 --> 0:34:14,659
essentially been captured by not just the
top five percent, but really the top one percent.


307
0:34:14,659 --> 0:34:24,329
And the average American worker's wages and
incomes have flatlined; they're not making


308
0:34:24,329 --> 0:34:30,429
progress. And they feel anxious about it,
and because they feel anxious about it, they


309
0:34:30,429 --> 0:34:37,899
are afraid of globalization. And that fear
has been fed by our politics. Now, my strong


310
0:34:37,899 --> 0:34:44,399
belief is that globalization is here to stay
and it is a powerful potential tool for good.


311
0:34:44,399 --> 0:34:51,69
But we've got to--but we've--but we have to
make sure that everybody has the ability to


312
0:34:51,69 --> 0:34:57,63
access what's good about globalization. And
right now, people are locked up. So very specifically,


313
0:34:57,63 --> 0:35:2,339
what would I do, I would transform our education
system and that means that we invest in early


314
0:35:2,339 --> 0:35:11,229
childhood education to close the achievement
gap that exists right now. And that's not


315
0:35:11,229 --> 0:35:14,829
just pre-kindergarten, I mean, it's zero over
to three. From the moment the child is born,


316
0:35:14,829 --> 0:35:18,619
if they're born to an at-risk parent, we're
going to that parent and we are helping them.


317
0:35:18,619 --> 0:35:22,609
If that parent can't read, we'll teach the
parent to read so they can read to their child.


318
0:35:22,609 --> 0:35:28,569
But make sure they're prepared for school.
That's step number one. The--in terms of K


319
0:35:28,569 --> 0:35:35,479
through 12, we know that the most important
element other than the parent in the child's


320
0:35:35,479 --> 0:35:40,91
learning is the teacher. So we--I will be
a president who stops talking about how great


321
0:35:40,91 --> 0:35:55,68
teachers are and actually starts rewarding
them for being great by paying them more money.


322
0:35:55,68 --> 0:36:1,65
We need to pay them higher salaries. We have
to give them more professional development,


323
0:36:1,65 --> 0:36:8,2
especially in their early years where they
start and we have to change how we asses progress


324
0:36:8,2 --> 0:36:13,29
for teachers because No Child Left Behind
has created a situation where people are being


325
0:36:13,29 --> 0:36:17,459
taught just the standardized test. They're
not being thought art, they're not being thought


326
0:36:17,459 --> 0:36:22,99
music, and it is stifling for the teacher
and for the student. Now, we have to have


327
0:36:22,99 --> 0:36:27,289
high standards, but those standards have to
build on what is best about the American education


328
0:36:27,289 --> 0:36:33,89
system, which is innovation, and creativity.
So that we have to take or we have to make


329
0:36:33,89 --> 0:36:41,989
college way more affordable. And one way to--one
way I will immediately do that is get to banks


330
0:36:41,989 --> 0:36:46,739
and financial institutions out of the business
of providing student loans. You can take billions


331
0:36:46,739 --> 0:36:50,999
of dollars of profits with the direct loan
program. So that's on the education front.


332
0:36:50,999 --> 0:36:56,349
We have to make investments in Broadband line
and infrastructure so that we are competitive.


333
0:36:56,349 --> 0:37:1,65
There has to be lifelong learning available
so that people can continually retrain. I


334
0:37:1,65 --> 0:37:12,19
mean, you know, I will steal a phrase from--I
think it was Tony Blair who said that, "We


335
0:37:12,19 --> 0:37:19,849
can't guarantee employment for everybody,
but we can guarantee that everybody is employable."


336
0:37:19,849 --> 0:37:24,209
And that means that people have to be able
to constantly transition in terms of their


337
0:37:24,209 --> 0:37:30,29
ability to adapt to new circumstances. And
technology can play a critical role in that,


338
0:37:30,29 --> 0:37:34,589
but we've got to make sure that it's accessible
and available to every person. And the last


339
0:37:34,589 --> 0:37:44,819
point I would make is that we've got to rebuild
our social safety net that has not been adapted


340
0:37:44,819 --> 0:37:54,769
since FDR. So, we've got to make sure that
healthcare is available even when you lose


341
0:37:54,769 --> 0:38:0,41
your job, that you have a retirement account
that follows you with the job. Part of the


342
0:38:0,41 --> 0:38:5,259
reason where an innovative society is--that
we've always felt that, you know what, if


343
0:38:5,259 --> 0:38:12,65
we take a risk and we make a misstep, that
there's some cushion there for--not just us


344
0:38:12,65 --> 0:38:18,9
but for our families as well. And that's why
universal healthcare is so important, that's


345
0:38:18,9 --> 0:38:22,45
why creating new systems for--to help people
say this is so important, so that we'll actually


346
0:38:22,45 --> 0:38:27,859
spur on people's willingness to take risks
in the marketplace. Right now, they don't


347
0:38:27,859 --> 0:38:38,829
feel as if they're able to do so.
>> A couple of final questions from me and


348
0:38:38,829 --> 0:38:44,739
then we'll ask some audience questions. I
had a privilege. I was watching 60 Minutes


349
0:38:44,739 --> 0:38:48,66
and I saw an interview with yourself and your
wife, Michelle, and there were a number of


350
0:38:48,66 --> 0:38:53,49
questions to you and then they asked--asked
your wife about it, and excuse, it’s rather


351
0:38:53,49 --> 0:38:54,309
a personal question. It's a question about
race.


352
0:38:54,309 --> 0:38:57,609
>> OBAMA: Uh-hmmm.
>> SCHMIDT: How did she feel about race, the


353
0:38:57,609 --> 0:39:2,499
dangers of presidency and so forth, and she
looked straight in the camera and she said,


354
0:39:2,499 --> 0:39:9,479
"I worry more about my husband walking down
the street from the Senate than anything else."


355
0:39:9,479 --> 0:39:18,269
At that moment, I understood the gap and perception
between people of races in America. And it


356
0:39:18,269 --> 0:39:23,64
was made vivid to me how different her view
and my view would be. The same question.


357
0:39:23,64 --> 0:39:25,989
>> OBAMA: All right.
>> SCHMIDT: Can you talk a little bit about


358
0:39:25,989 --> 0:39:32,349
that issue in America?
>> OBAMA: Absolutely. Look, the W. B. Du Bois


359
0:39:32,349 --> 0:39:37,95
said that the problem of the 21st--the problem
of the 20th century is the problem of the


360
0:39:37,95 --> 0:39:46,63
colored one. And if you expand that, the problem
of the 21st century is the problem of the


361
0:39:46,63 --> 0:39:52,829
other, people who are not like us, whether
it's in religious terms. If you go to Sri


362
0:39:52,829 --> 0:39:59,259
Lanka, it's, you know, what's been fueling
as a vicious civil war there even though everybody


363
0:39:59,259 --> 0:40:6,239
looks exactly the same, same with--in Northern
Ireland, or it manifests itself in this country


364
0:40:6,239 --> 0:40:13,39
in racial terms. And that--it has always been
a nagging problem. There have been reports


365
0:40:13,39 --> 0:40:17,709
just this week that African-Americans feel
more pessimistic than they have in a very


366
0:40:17,709 --> 0:40:27,229
long time and there's statistics that bear
out. Why--how they in fact have not kept pace


367
0:40:27,229 --> 0:40:34,269
when it comes to economic growth in this country.
The virulent and anti-immigrant sentiment


368
0:40:34,269 --> 0:40:40,609
that we're seeing all across the country is
something that has been striking. I mean,


369
0:40:40,609 --> 0:40:45,209
just in the last two years, you're seeing
a shift where, you know, I fought for comprehensive


370
0:40:45,209 --> 0:40:53,44
immigration reform two years ago and we didn't
succeed, but there wasn't this raw anger about


371
0:40:53,44 --> 0:41:1,459
it that you see now even when I'm campaigning
among Democrats sometimes. So part of what


372
0:41:1,459 --> 0:41:8,65
I believe I bring to this office is somebody
who sees the world through a variety of different


373
0:41:8,65 --> 0:41:14,749
races. My mother was white, my father was
African. I grew up in Hawaii. I've got a sister


374
0:41:14,749 --> 0:41:19,38
who's half Indonesian. She's married to a
Chinese Canadian. You know, I've said...


375
0:41:19,38 --> 0:41:24,359
>> SCHMIDT: It sounds like Google.
>> OBAMA: Yeah. It's--my family would fit


376
0:41:24,359 --> 0:41:35,719
right in here, no doubt about it. But people
talk about our federal budget deficit, right?


377
0:41:35,719 --> 0:41:40,859
We have an empathy deficit. We aren’t able
to see the world through other people's eyes.


378
0:41:40,859 --> 0:41:46,229
And that's what I think I can provide. Now,
very concretely, what we need to do when it


379
0:41:46,229 --> 0:41:53,499
comes to issues of race, I think a lot of
the tensions are tied to economics. African-Americans


380
0:41:53,499 --> 0:42:0,64
and Latinos are much more likely to be unemployed,
employed in lower-wage jobs, will not have


381
0:42:0,64 --> 0:42:8,829
healthcare, and be in substandard schools,
drops out of school. So on in every indicator,


382
0:42:8,829 --> 0:42:14,539
they're doing worse. And that contributes
to that gap in perceptions that you're talking


383
0:42:14,539 --> 0:42:19,729
about because, you know, the glass often looks
half empty to a lot of African-American and


384
0:42:19,729 --> 0:42:26,779
Latino children. And so, part of our job in
investing an early childhood education or


385
0:42:26,779 --> 0:42:33,729
making sure that they're going to outstanding
schools, or insuring equality of opportunity


386
0:42:33,729 --> 0:42:42,309
when it comes to employment, enforcing our
Civil Rights laws, investigating crimes like


387
0:42:42,309 --> 0:42:48,969
news is being hanged in classrooms. All that
contributes to a sense that these kids matter


388
0:42:48,969 --> 0:42:57,15
to us, that they're not those kids, they’re
our kids, and when we can have a culture and


389
0:42:57,15 --> 0:43:4,49
a government that perceives every child as
mattering, and then they will respond differently.


390
0:43:4,49 --> 0:43:10,79
And I think we will start stitching together
the kind of America that all of us hope and


391
0:43:10,79 --> 0:43:15,949
dream for.
>> SCHMIDT: That's promising, absolutely riveting.


392
0:43:15,949 --> 0:43:19,29
Let's get a couple of questions from the audience.
I've also got--why don't you go ahead--and


393
0:43:19,29 --> 0:43:24,379
I've also got some that were submitted that
we also ranked, so, go ahead.


394
0:43:24,379 --> 0:43:27,619
>> First of all, thank so much for coming.
Your words are really inspiring.


395
0:43:27,619 --> 0:43:30,66
>> OBAMA: Thank you.
>> And we really appreciate it. You know,


396
0:43:30,66 --> 0:43:31,7
I've been voting for quite few a years, a
little older than the average Googler. And…


397
0:43:31,7 --> 0:43:38,289
>> OBAMA: Yeah, you know, you, like, look
like you might almost be my age.


398
0:43:38,289 --> 0:43:41,659
>> Maybe a little older.
>> OBAMA: Yeah.


399
0:43:41,659 --> 0:43:47,42
>> And, you know, Bill Clinton is the only
Democrat elected in the last 30 years. And


400
0:43:47,42 --> 0:43:51,39
he's the only Democrat elected twice since
World War II.


401
0:43:51,39 --> 0:43:53,819
>> OBAMA: Right.
>> I'm tired of losing.


402
0:43:53,819 --> 0:43:58,4
>> OBAMA: Right.
>> So, what have you learned from Clinton


403
0:43:58,4 --> 0:44:3,329
that is going to make you win? What are you
going to do differently? And what have you


404
0:44:3,329 --> 0:44:9,349
learned from Gore and from Kerry and all those
guys that you're going to avoid so that history


405
0:44:9,349 --> 0:44:12,789
doesn’t reoccur?
>> OBAMA: Well, first of all, I think--there's


406
0:44:12,789 --> 0:44:17,359
a lot to learn from Bill Clinton. I mean,
one of the things that Clinton did I think


407
0:44:17,359 --> 0:44:29,719
was recognize the moment. We were in a particular
moment in 1991-'92 when the Democrats had


408
0:44:29,719 --> 0:44:38,42
not wrung out the excesses of the '60s and
the early '70s, we were still deeply invested


409
0:44:38,42 --> 0:44:46,469
in identity politics and interest group politics.
And the Democratic Congress wasn’t showing


410
0:44:46,469 --> 0:44:51,539
itself adaptable and shaking off some of the
orthodoxies of the past. And he came in and


411
0:44:51,539 --> 0:44:55,849
he said, "You know what? I'm a different kind
of Democrat, and I'm willing to do things


412
0:44:55,849 --> 0:45:4,9
in some new ways." And that was a powerful
message for that moment. The reason I'm running


413
0:45:4,9 --> 0:45:8,559
and the reason I believe I'm going to win
is because we are in a different moment. So


414
0:45:8,559 --> 0:45:12,949
you can't just copy what Bill Clinton did,
but you have to take the same approach. What


415
0:45:12,949 --> 0:45:18,969
is it that's needed right now? And I believe
that what's needed right now is the capacity


416
0:45:18,969 --> 0:45:26,339
to bring people together to think in practical
reasoned ways about big problems that we face


417
0:45:26,339 --> 0:45:31,989
to be straight with the American people about--and
honest with them about the challenges that


418
0:45:31,989 --> 0:45:37,999
we face. So part of what our message is built
around is that we are in this defining moment


419
0:45:37,999 --> 0:45:43,199
and we can't keep doing the same things that
we've been doing that haven’t been working.


420
0:45:43,199 --> 0:45:50,65
So that's point number one. What I've learned
in terms of how Democrats lose? Democrats


421
0:45:50,65 --> 0:45:58,999
lose when they are not clear about what they
stand for. Democrats lose when they are attacked,


422
0:45:58,999 --> 0:46:4,91
and because they don't know where they stand,
they end up getting defensive instead of going


423
0:46:4,91 --> 0:46:9,869
on the offensive. So, let me give you a very
specific example, I am looking forward to


424
0:46:9,869 --> 0:46:17,539
having a debate with whether it's Rudy Giuliani
or Mitt Romney about the fear mongering that


425
0:46:17,539 --> 0:46:22,789
has dominated the Republican debate of, like,
where they're going to say I'm going to double


426
0:46:22,789 --> 0:46:30,39
Guantanamo. Or, I'm going to, I think torture
is okay. Or, you know, at least we'll redefine


427
0:46:30,39 --> 0:46:35,719
torture. So torture is not okay, but these
things that look on off are like--like it,


428
0:46:35,719 --> 0:46:44,44
are okay. Or we need to do whatever it takes
to read people's e-mails. And I am looking


429
0:46:44,44 --> 0:46:49,259
forward to having that debate. But the problem
we have is when we get defensive, and we're


430
0:46:49,259 --> 0:46:56,269
not sure about our beliefs and our convictions,
and so we start trying to sound a little bit


431
0:46:56,269 --> 0:47:2,779
like them, and that is a profound mistake.
One of the things that my wife and I, we said


432
0:47:2,779 --> 0:47:7,609
to ourselves when we got into this race is
if we start sounding like anybody--everybody


433
0:47:7,609 --> 0:47:12,749
else, then what's the point, you know? I should
go work for Google, you know, it'll be more


434
0:47:12,749 --> 0:47:15,799
fun.
>> SCHMIDT: You answered the question correctly.


435
0:47:15,799 --> 0:47:23,969
>> OBAMA: I did answer the question correctly.
So making sure that we're clear about where


436
0:47:23,969 --> 0:47:31,939
we stand, honest with the American people,
seizing the moment and recognizing that we


437
0:47:31,939 --> 0:47:40,64
have to deal with climate change now, we have
to deal with healthcare now. We have to revamp


438
0:47:40,64 --> 0:47:48,18
our education system now. We have to double
our investment and research and science now


439
0:47:48,18 --> 0:47:54,739
and understanding that we don't have a lot
of time to waste. That I think is going to


440
0:47:54,739 --> 0:48:4,63
be a compelling message for the American people.
Thank you. Thanks.


441
0:48:4,63 --> 0:48:7,329
>> SCHMIDT: We--okay, thank you very much,
Senator. We have an electronically submitted


442
0:48:7,329 --> 0:48:7,41
question dealing with federal deficit.
>> OBAMA: Okay.


443
0:48:7,41 --> 0:48:10,9
>> SCHMIDT: What concrete steps will the Obama
Administration take to address the federal


444
0:48:10,9 --> 0:48:15,289
government's deficit and debt? What specific
tax measures and program changes will you


445
0:48:15,289 --> 0:48:20,67
recommend to Congress?
>> OBAMA: This has been the fiscally the most


446
0:48:20,67 --> 0:48:25,849
irresponsible administration that we have
seen. I mean, we have increased the national


447
0:48:25,849 --> 0:48:35,9
debt, almost doubled it since George Bush
took office. It is now over $9 trillion. And


448
0:48:35,9 --> 0:48:43,119
that is money that we're all going to have
to pay back. So, the first thing that we have


449
0:48:43,119 --> 0:48:49,43
to do is to bring an end to this war in Iraq.
We're spending $10 to $12 billion per month.


450
0:48:49,43 --> 0:49:0,93
The latest request for both Iraq and Afghanistan
are $196 billion for next year. One year,


451
0:49:0,93 --> 0:49:10,68
a $196 billion. That is money that could be
providing health insurance to all Americans.


452
0:49:10,68 --> 0:49:15,819
It could be rebuilding our schools. It could
be providing higher teachers’ salaries.


453
0:49:15,819 --> 0:49:21,59
It could be providing scholarships for every
American, young persons going to college.


454
0:49:21,59 --> 0:49:30,92
So we are using our resources in a way that's
not sound. We can recapture some of that money.


455
0:49:30,92 --> 0:49:37,709
Some of it will go to taking care of our veterans,
some of it should go to social programs, and


456
0:49:37,709 --> 0:49:43,41
some of it should go towards deficit reduction.
Second principle is a very similar principle


457
0:49:43,41 --> 0:49:47,569
called Pay Go. If you want to cut taxes, you’ve
got to cut spending, if you want to raise


458
0:49:47,569 --> 0:49:53,709
spending, you got to raise revenue, so that
you have honest accounting. Right now, the


459
0:49:53,709 --> 0:50:2,199
federal budget is not honest. And unless we
have good numbers, we can't end up dealing


460
0:50:2,199 --> 0:50:6,569
with this budget issue. Now, the biggest problem
we have in terms of our budget though long


461
0:50:6,569 --> 0:50:15,959
term. And look, I want to eliminate no-bid
contracts. I want to scrub the federal budget


462
0:50:15,959 --> 0:50:22,339
free of earmarks and pet projects that are
not based on our national priorities and that


463
0:50:22,339 --> 0:50:26,999
require transparency in government. I talked
earlier about the power of technology. One


464
0:50:26,999 --> 0:50:30,869
of the things that we've done, you'll be pleased
to know that we call this the Google for Government


465
0:50:30,869 --> 0:50:36,69
bill and…
>> SCHMIDT: Google is in favor of it.


466
0:50:36,69 --> 0:50:40,839
>> OBAMA: Yes. And what it does is we're going
to set up a searchable database for every


467
0:50:40,839 --> 0:50:45,4
dollar of federal spending so that we can
track it, which means that we'll be able to--journalist


468
0:50:45,4 --> 0:50:50,999
and ordinary citizens and think tanks and,
you know, advocacy groups will be able to


469
0:50:50,999 --> 0:50:56,39
see it. There are moneys going to a bridge
to nowhere instead of going to a bridge to


470
0:50:56,39 --> 0:51:1,4
somewhere. We'll be able to challenge it in
real time and that's going to be important.


471
0:51:1,4 --> 0:51:4,609
But the last thing I was going to mention--and
this is probably the biggest problem we have


472
0:51:4,609 --> 0:51:10,91
with the federal budget is healthcare spending;
Medicare and Medicaid. That's the big budget


473
0:51:10,91 --> 0:51:17,88
buster. That's the scary thing out there that
it will be, like, the blop. It will just consume


474
0:51:17,88 --> 0:51:22,779
everything unless we do something about it
now. And again, technology is part of the


475
0:51:22,779 --> 0:51:27,509
answer. And innovation is going to be part
of the answer in reducing these costs. The


476
0:51:27,509 --> 0:51:32,299
reason that healthcare cost is skyrocketing
is not so much that the population is getting


477
0:51:32,299 --> 0:51:36,799
older, that contributes a little bit to it,
but the main problem is healthcare inflation


478
0:51:36,799 --> 0:51:45,13
goes up six, eight, ten percent per year.
It's unsustainable. And so for example, if


479
0:51:45,13 --> 0:51:53,739
we use Health I. T., just simple stuff, making
sure that everybody's medical records are


480
0:51:53,739 --> 0:52:1,93
on digital--in a digital form, so that when
a nurse pulls up somebody's chart, they can


481
0:52:1,93 --> 0:52:7,14
actually read the writing, and they’re not
administering the wrong drug. Making sure


482
0:52:7,14 --> 0:52:12,68
that billing is all electronic. That can make
a huge difference, investing and prevention,


483
0:52:12,68 --> 0:52:19,249
so that children are getting regular check-ups
instead of having to go to the emergency room


484
0:52:19,249 --> 0:52:23,69
for treatable illnesses like asthma. That
makes an enormous difference. That will probably


485
0:52:23,69 --> 0:52:29,859
be the biggest savings item for our federal
budget if we do it right. And people like


486
0:52:29,859 --> 0:52:33,579
yourselves can be a part of that process.
>> SCHMIDT: Thank you. Ethan.


487
0:52:33,579 --> 0:52:37,19
>> ETHAN: Thank you, Senator Obama, for coming
to visit us. And we’re really pulling for


488
0:52:37,19 --> 0:52:38,72
you out here in the Bay area.
>> OBAMA: Thank you.


489
0:52:38,72 --> 0:52:44,589
>> ETHAN: I'm a big supporter and a vocal
supporter, and the biggest issue that I constantly


490
0:52:44,589 --> 0:52:48,66
hear brought up about you is the lack of experience,
the inexperience issue.


491
0:52:48,66 --> 0:52:52,199
>> OBAMA: Right.
>> ETHAN: And I heard about it amongst my


492
0:52:52,199 --> 0:52:53,749
friends, you read about that in the press,
I'm sure you’ve had the answers to lots


493
0:52:53,749 --> 0:52:57,43
of questions about it, without getting into--frankly,
I guess you can--but without getting whether


494
0:52:57,43 --> 0:53:1,739
experience makes a difference or not, but
what you’re actually going to do to address


495
0:53:1,739 --> 0:53:7,42
this perceived weakness and allow a lot of
voters that want to get behind you and want


496
0:53:7,42 --> 0:53:12,14
to support you to get past this issue of inexperience.
>> OBAMA: Right. Well, look. The--first of


497
0:53:12,14 --> 0:53:23,92
all, Sergey and Larry didn’t have a lot
of experience starting a fortune 100 companies.


498
0:53:23,92 --> 0:53:33,529
And it's a--and I suppose when they came in,
we're talking to Dave Drummond about incorporating


499
0:53:33,529 --> 0:53:41,949
Google. You could have said, "Duh, these guys
don't know what they’re doing." But, you


500
0:53:41,949 --> 0:53:51,849
know, what we're looking for, I believe, when
it comes to leadership is judgment, vision,


501
0:53:51,849 --> 0:54:2,199
character. And that's what I bring to bear
in this race. I have the experience of bringing


502
0:54:2,199 --> 0:54:8,349
people together to get things done that I
would put up against any candidate in this


503
0:54:8,349 --> 0:54:15,809
race. When I was in Illinois, I expanded healthcare
to Illinoisians by getting Democrats and Republicans


504
0:54:15,809 --> 0:54:20,809
to agree and work together. We were able to
reform a death penalty system that was broken


505
0:54:20,809 --> 0:54:28,199
by getting law enforcement and Civil Rights
advocates to agree on things that people said


506
0:54:28,199 --> 0:54:32,569
was--were impossible, but I was able to get
it done, probably, because I'm pretty good


507
0:54:32,569 --> 0:54:40,299
at listening to people and finding common
ground. I've also got the ability to stand


508
0:54:40,299 --> 0:54:46,66
up for what I believe in even when it's unpopular,
which I think is the quality that the next


509
0:54:46,66 --> 0:54:52,969
president has to provide. I mean part of the
reason I was opposed to the war--I was opposed


510
0:54:52,969 --> 0:54:58,709
to the war in Iraq back in 2002 when George
Bush was at 65%, I didn’t just stumble into


511
0:54:58,709 --> 0:55:4,229
that. It was based on having thought through
what the consequences would be, understanding


512
0:55:4,229 --> 0:55:9,729
that I was running in the U.S. Senate race,
and I might lose my race, but I thought that


513
0:55:9,729 --> 0:55:15,39
it was important to speak out forcefully on
what I believed in. I think that's what the


514
0:55:15,39 --> 0:55:23,439
next president has to offer. And I know how
to choose talent, get smart people around


515
0:55:23,439 --> 0:55:30,979
me who are capable and independent and bring
together a variety of different points of


516
0:55:30,979 --> 0:55:37,39
views and then set a vision and move in the
same direction, that, more than anything is


517
0:55:37,39 --> 0:55:44,469
what we need. We're not looking for a Chief
Operating Officer when we select a president.


518
0:55:44,469 --> 0:55:49,29
What were looking for is somebody who will
say--will chart a course and say, "Here's


519
0:55:49,29 --> 0:55:54,249
where America needs to go. Here's how we need
to solve our energy crises. Here's how we


520
0:55:54,249 --> 0:56:0,99
need to revamp our education system," and
then gather the talent together and mobilize


521
0:56:0,99 --> 0:56:6,709
that talent to achieve that goal and to inspire
a sense of hope and possibility. So one way


522
0:56:6,709 --> 0:56:9,969
to answer this question is to say, "Look,
the guy has been in the public service for


523
0:56:9,969 --> 0:56:16,219
20 years. He's a constitutional law professor.
He was a Civil Rights lawyer. He did X, Y,


524
0:56:16,219 --> 0:56:20,449
and Z in the state legislature. He's done
all these wonderful things in the United States


525
0:56:20,449 --> 0:56:26,16
Senate." But I think the main way to respond
is to say, "This is all about judgment and


526
0:56:26,16 --> 0:56:33,88
character." And also, I think, a little sense
of impatience because part of the reason I'm


527
0:56:33,88 --> 0:56:42,38
running is I'm impatient with the status quo.
And what we've seen out of Democrats and Republicans--what


528
0:56:42,38 --> 0:56:53,779
we’ve seen from Democrats and Republicans
is a certain willingness to tolerate, what


529
0:56:53,779 --> 0:56:57,349
I consider to be an intolerable status quo.
And I think the American people feel that


530
0:56:57,349 --> 0:57:4,569
same frustration. So, thank you.
>> SCHMIDT: Thank you. Then we have our--we're


531
0:57:4,569 --> 0:57:6,469
going to have our, unfortunately, our last
question, so why don't you go ahead.


532
0:57:6,469 --> 0:57:12,719
>> Senator, you said you had a bias to act
against special interest.


533
0:57:12,719 --> 0:57:15,749
>> OBAMA: Yeah.
>> But if special interests were having a


534
0:57:15,749 --> 0:57:20,959
perverting influence on the entire legislative
process, what can you propose as president


535
0:57:20,959 --> 0:57:26,279
that can make it through that process intact?
>> OBAMA: Yeah, it is the classic question


536
0:57:26,279 --> 0:57:33,699
of how do you get insiders to fix the system
that they’re benefiting from, and it's hard.


537
0:57:33,699 --> 0:57:42,319
You have to use shame. No, and I mean it.
I'll give you an example. Last year, I passed


538
0:57:42,319 --> 0:57:49,739
the toughest ethics reform legislation since
Watergate. And I worked with Russ Feingold


539
0:57:49,739 --> 0:57:55,469
and we eliminated corporate gifts or gifts
from lobbyists, meals from lobbyists, and


540
0:57:55,469 --> 0:58:0,509
corporate jets from lobbyists. We required
the disclosure of campaign contributions that


541
0:58:0,509 --> 0:58:6,38
were bundled from lobbyists. And I'll be honest
with you, when we first started, it wasn’t


542
0:58:6,38 --> 0:58:12,41
just resistance from Republicans, there were
Democrats who didn’t want to see this happen


543
0:58:12,41 --> 0:58:21,709
either. But what I knew was that if you stuck
with it and you got it to the floor where


544
0:58:21,709 --> 0:58:26,989
the people had to vote, then it was going
to be hard for them to vote against it. So


545
0:58:26,989 --> 0:58:38,42
part of the key for any reform is going to
be getting the American people to pay enough


546
0:58:38,42 --> 0:58:43,539
attention, that members of Congress start
worrying, "You know what, the American are


547
0:58:43,539 --> 0:58:51,459
looking at us. And so we better change how
we behave," that's why this Google for Government


548
0:58:51,459 --> 0:58:58,999
is so important because it--that's why transparency
generally is so important in this entire process


549
0:58:58,999 --> 0:59:4,9
because the more American people know, the
more government is going to be held accountable.


550
0:59:4,9 --> 0:59:9,509
And I'll give you just one very specific example
around healthcare. I've mention that I want


551
0:59:9,509 --> 0:59:13,749
to set up a system where every American has
healthcare that's at least as good as the


552
0:59:13,749 --> 0:59:21,569
healthcare I've got as a member of Congress.
And if people want to--and if you’re interested


553
0:59:21,569 --> 0:59:29,9
in the details of the healthcare plan, you
can go to my website, barackobama.com. But


554
0:59:29,9 --> 0:59:33,839
people asked me, "Well, why do you think you
can get it done and overcome the insurance


555
0:59:33,839 --> 0:59:37,939
and the drug companies to spent a billion
dollars over the last decade preventing the


556
0:59:37,939 --> 0:59:44,719
reform from happening in lobbying and campaign
contributions?" And what I tell them is, "Yeah,


557
0:59:44,719 --> 0:59:50,969
I respect what the Clintons tried to do in
1993, in moving health reform forward." But


558
0:59:50,969 --> 0:59:55,679
they made one really big mistake and that
is they took all their people and all their


559
0:59:55,679 --> 1:0:3,739
experts into a room and then they close the
door and they try to design the plan in isolation


560
1:0:3,739 --> 1:0:8,16
from the American people. And during that
period of time, the insurance companies and


561
1:0:8,16 --> 1:0:13,88
the drug companies, and the HMOs they mobilized,
and by the time the Clintons announced their


562
1:0:13,88 --> 1:0:17,809
plan, you already have this Harry and Louise
heads up, you guys don't remember this, you


563
1:0:17,809 --> 1:0:27,969
weren’t born, maybe, I'm teasing. You were
six. But these ads were out there that convinced


564
1:0:27,969 --> 1:0:32,92
the American people they should be afraid
of healthcare reform. Now, I will do it entirely


565
1:0:32,92 --> 1:0:38,799
differently. Within the first 100 days of
my administration, we are going to have a


566
1:0:38,799 --> 1:0:45,549
big table, and everybody is going to be invited;
laborer, employers, doctors, nurses, hospital


567
1:0:45,549 --> 1:0:49,619
administrators, patient advocate groups, the
drug and insurance company, they’re all


568
1:0:49,619 --> 1:0:58,509
going to sit at the table, they just won't
get to buy every chair. And we will work on


569
1:0:58,509 --> 1:1:6,66
this process publicly. It will be on C-SPAN.
It will be streaming over the net. And every


570
1:1:6,66 --> 1:1:10,819
time we hit a glitch where somebody says,
"Well, no, no, no, we can't lower drug prices


571
1:1:10,819 --> 1:1:21,819
because of, yeah, RND cost that drug companies
need." Well, we'll present data and facts


572
1:1:21,819 --> 1:1:26,699
that make it more difficult for people to
carry the water of their special interest


573
1:1:26,699 --> 1:1:30,42
because it's public. And if they start running
Harry and Louise ads, I'll make my own ads


574
1:1:30,42 --> 1:1:38,699
or I'll send out something on YouTube, I’m
president, and I'll be able to--I'll let them


575
1:1:38,699 --> 1:1:46,219
know what the facts are. But, you know, one
of the things that you learn when you’re


576
1:1:46,219 --> 1:1:51,509
traveling and running for president is the
American people at their core are a decent


577
1:1:51,509 --> 1:1:57,209
people. There's a generosity of spirit there
and there's common sense their, but it's not


578
1:1:57,209 --> 1:2:3,769
tapped. And many people are--they are just
misinformed or they’re too busy, they're


579
1:2:3,769 --> 1:2:7,829
trying to get their kids to school, they're
working, but they just don't have enough information


580
1:2:7,829 --> 1:2:11,929
or just they're not professionals at sorting
out all information that's out there. And


581
1:2:11,929 --> 1:2:17,699
so our political process gets skewed, but
if you give them good information, their instincts


582
1:2:17,699 --> 1:2:21,839
are good and they will make good decisions.
And the president has the bully pulpit to


583
1:2:21,839 --> 1:2:27,609
give them good information, and that's what
we have to return to as a government where


584
1:2:27,609 --> 1:2:32,199
the American people trust the information
they’re getting. And I'm really looking


585
1:2:32,199 --> 1:2:38,499
forward to doing that because I am a big believer
in reason, in facts, in evidence, in science,


586
1:2:38,499 --> 1:2:44,439
in feedback, everything that allows you to
do what you do, that's what we should be doing


587
1:2:44,439 --> 1:2:52,459
in our government. I want people in technology.
I want innovators and engineers and scientists


588
1:2:52,459 --> 1:3:0,16
like yourselves, I want you helping us make
policy based on facts, based on reason. You


589
1:3:0,16 --> 1:3:4,309
know, one of my favorite stories I have from
Washington is Daniel Patrick Moynihan, he


590
1:3:4,309 --> 1:3:12,259
was a giant of the Senate and a very, you
know, towering intellect. And he got an argument


591
1:3:12,259 --> 1:3:18,16
one time with another senator, and the other
senator apparently was losing the argument,


592
1:3:18,16 --> 1:3:22,989
and so he got kind of huffy, and he said,
"Well, Pat, you know, you're entitled to your


593
1:3:22,989 --> 1:3:27,749
opinion and I'm entitled to mine." And Moynihan
says, "You are entitled to your own opinion,


594
1:3:27,749 --> 1:3:34,249
but you’re not entitled to your own facts."
And part of the problem that we're having


595
1:3:34,249 --> 1:3:44,729
and special interests exploit this is we constantly
have a contest where facts don't matter. And


596
1:3:44,729 --> 1:3:54,289
I want to restore that sense of decisions
being based on facts to the White House. And


597
1:3:54,289 --> 1:3:58,289
I think that many of you can help me, so I
want you to be involved. Thank you so much


598
1:3:58,289 --> 1:3:58,4
everybody.
>> SCHMIDT: Thank you.


599
1:3:58,4 --> 1:3:58,65
>> OBAMA: Thank you.
>> SCHMIDT: Senator, thank you very much.


600
1:3:58,65 --> 1:5:58,65
>> OBAMA: Thank you.
