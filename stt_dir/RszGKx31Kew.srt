1
0:0:3,227 --> 0:0:5,653
I'm telling you,
you gonna like this.


2
0:0:5,653 --> 0:0:8,6
Let me change back to basketball games,


3
0:0:8,6 --> 0:0:9,877
I didn't come here to watch soccer.


4
0:0:9,877 --> 0:0:11,456
It's not about the soccer.


5
0:0:11,456 --> 0:0:13,62
Man, she better be hot.


6
0:0:13,62 --> 0:0:16,226
Listen, Mexican sideline reporters,


7
0:0:16,226 --> 0:0:19,63
and American sideline reporters
are two different things.


8
0:0:19,63 --> 0:0:20,898
- Yeah, you know
how you never see Hannah Storm


9
0:0:20,898 --> 0:0:21,865
from the waist down?


10
0:0:21,865 --> 0:0:23,567
- Yeah.
- She's the opposite.


11
0:0:23,567 --> 0:0:26,97
No one knows
what her face looks like.


12
0:0:26,97 --> 0:0:29,373
All: Oh!


13
0:0:29,373 --> 0:0:31,41
- <i>Gol!</i>


14
0:0:31,41 --> 0:0:32,376
- Man, look at that.


15
0:0:32,376 --> 0:0:35,145
She's so hot, I would hit
Alyssa Milano in the head


16
0:0:35,145 --> 0:0:37,448
with Fran Drescher
just to get to her.


17
0:0:37,448 --> 0:0:38,615
- Yo, you know what?


18
0:0:38,615 --> 0:0:41,518
Shorty make me want to brush up
on my <i>habla español.</i>


19
0:0:41,518 --> 0:0:44,321
- She is so hot,
elderly couples from long island


20
0:0:44,321 --> 0:0:46,56
spend the winter at her.


21
0:0:46,56 --> 0:0:47,691
- [Laughs]


22
0:0:47,691 --> 0:0:49,927
- I could not play football
with her on the sidelines.


23
0:0:49,927 --> 0:0:52,129
I'd be dropping passes
or running the wrong plays,


24
0:0:52,129 --> 0:0:53,797
showing up to the wrong game.


25
0:0:53,797 --> 0:0:56,934
- You did that stuff anyway.


26
0:0:56,934 --> 0:0:59,903
- Look, if anything
ever happened to me and...


27
0:0:59,903 --> 0:1:1,271
Suzanne, hey.


28
0:1:1,271 --> 0:1:2,906
How you doing, baby?


29
0:1:2,906 --> 0:1:3,874
You're home early.


30
0:1:3,874 --> 0:1:5,75
- Hi.
- All right.


31
0:1:5,75 --> 0:1:6,41
- Hey, guys.


32
0:1:6,41 --> 0:1:7,444
- Okay.


33
0:1:7,444 --> 0:1:8,912
- And that's our cue.


34
0:1:8,912 --> 0:1:10,447
- All right, it's been real.


35
0:1:10,447 --> 0:1:11,415
- Good to see you.


36
0:1:11,415 --> 0:1:17,354
- Next week?
- Hopefully.


37
0:1:17,354 --> 0:1:19,99
Hey, babe, are you
gonna be here next Sunday?


38
0:1:19,99 --> 0:1:21,992
- Uh, I don't know.


39
0:1:21,992 --> 0:1:24,395
Why? You want to go out?


40
0:1:24,395 --> 0:1:27,231
Oh, we could take the ferry
over to bainbridwe


41
0:1:27,231 --> 0:1:29,166
and have some brunch.


42
0:1:29,166 --> 0:1:32,336
- Oh, no, I was thinking about
having the guys over again.


43
0:1:32,336 --> 0:1:33,937
I mean, but if you're
gonna be here,


44
0:1:33,937 --> 0:1:36,54
we'll just go to a bar.


45
0:1:36,54 --> 0:1:39,743
- How come I can't be here
if the guys are over?


46
0:1:39,743 --> 0:1:41,912
- Well, I don't want
to disturb you.


47
0:1:41,912 --> 0:1:44,481
- I never said
you disturbed me.


48
0:1:44,481 --> 0:1:46,984
- That's 'cause you're not here
while we're watching the game.


49
0:1:46,984 --> 0:1:48,51
I mean, if you were,


50
0:1:48,51 --> 0:1:50,721
then you'd probably
be disturbed.


51
0:1:50,721 --> 0:1:52,723
- Oh, I get it.


52
0:1:52,723 --> 0:1:54,792
You don't want me here
when you're watching the game


53
0:1:54,792 --> 0:1:56,727
with your little friends.


54
0:1:56,727 --> 0:1:58,695
- Why does this
have to be about you?


55
0:1:58,695 --> 0:2:0,364
I'm just trying
to watch the game.


56
0:2:0,364 --> 0:2:1,832
- I like basketball.


57
0:2:1,832 --> 0:2:3,467
How come I can't watch?


58
0:2:3,467 --> 0:2:4,768
- You can.


59
0:2:4,768 --> 0:2:8,38
Just not with us.


60
0:2:8,38 --> 0:2:9,406
Baby.


61
0:2:9,406 --> 0:2:11,8
Look, I love you.


62
0:2:11,8 --> 0:2:12,75
But every now and then,


63
0:2:12,75 --> 0:2:14,812
I just need some time
with the boys, you know?


64
0:2:14,812 --> 0:2:16,78
Man time.


65
0:2:16,78 --> 0:2:18,148
- Well, I'm gonna be here,


66
0:2:18,148 --> 0:2:20,25
so you can just go
to your funky little bar


67
0:2:20,25 --> 0:2:22,252
and have your man time.


68
0:2:22,252 --> 0:2:24,721
- Sweetheart,
don't be like that.


69
0:2:24,721 --> 0:2:27,624
Look, what's for dinner, baby?


70
0:2:27,624 --> 0:2:29,726
- I don't know, baby.


71
0:2:29,726 --> 0:2:37,167
Why don't you ask your boys?

77
0:2:51,548 --> 0:2:54,718
- please pass the milk.


78
0:2:54,718 --> 0:2:56,987
- Are you sure
you want me to do it?


79
0:2:56,987 --> 0:3:1,325
Maybe you want one of your boys
to pass the milk.


80
0:3:1,325 --> 0:3:3,393
- I hope you're not like this
when my mother gets here.


81
0:3:3,393 --> 0:3:5,829
- Oh, see, I was thinking
maybe you didn't want me around


82
0:3:5,829 --> 0:3:6,997
when she's here.


83
0:3:6,997 --> 0:3:8,932
I've already interfered
with your man time.


84
0:3:8,932 --> 0:3:11,468
I don't want to interfere
with your mama time.


85
0:3:11,468 --> 0:3:12,936
- Is grandma coming?


86
0:3:12,936 --> 0:3:13,971
- Couple of weeks.


87
0:3:13,971 --> 0:3:15,439
And please,
don't call her grandma.


88
0:3:15,439 --> 0:3:16,44
You know she hates that.


89
0:3:16,44 --> 0:3:17,508
- Why is she staying here?


90
0:3:17,508 --> 0:3:18,976
- I asked the same thing.


91
0:3:18,976 --> 0:3:20,477
- She's moving
into a new apartment,


92
0:3:20,477 --> 0:3:21,678
and it's not ready yet.


93
0:3:21,678 --> 0:3:23,514
- Kevin, she's gonna be sleeping
in your room,


94
0:3:23,514 --> 0:3:24,715
so make sure it's clean.


95
0:3:24,715 --> 0:3:26,383
- I made my bed.


96
0:3:26,383 --> 0:3:28,118
- We mean,
if there's anything in there


97
0:3:28,118 --> 0:3:29,286
you don't want her to see,


98
0:3:29,286 --> 0:3:35,359
get it out of there now.


99
0:3:35,359 --> 0:3:36,927
- Whose bathroom
is she gonna use?


100
0:3:36,927 --> 0:3:46,103
- Ours.


101
0:3:46,103 --> 0:3:47,905
- So he told you to your face


102
0:3:47,905 --> 0:3:49,873
he didn't want you
to see the game with him?


103
0:3:49,873 --> 0:3:50,908
- Yes.


104
0:3:50,908 --> 0:3:52,309
Can you believe that?


105
0:3:52,309 --> 0:3:53,277
- That's great.


106
0:3:53,277 --> 0:3:54,978
Suzanne, that name loves you.


107
0:3:54,978 --> 0:3:56,213
Shoot, I'm jealous.


108
0:3:56,213 --> 0:3:57,848
- Uh, hello!


109
0:3:57,848 --> 0:3:59,349
Are you paying attention?


110
0:3:59,349 --> 0:4:1,451
He told me
he doesn't want me around.


111
0:4:1,451 --> 0:4:3,42
- He's telling you how heels.


112
0:4:3,42 --> 0:4:6,423
I mean, I wish
I had a man that honest.


113
0:4:6,423 --> 0:4:7,758
No games.


114
0:4:7,758 --> 0:4:9,493
No trying to figure out
if he really has money,


115
0:4:9,493 --> 0:4:11,962
or is he just saying that
so you won't get mad?


116
0:4:11,962 --> 0:4:14,464
- So you think Nick's right?


117
0:4:14,464 --> 0:4:15,599
- What do you think?


118
0:4:15,599 --> 0:4:16,7
Do you think he's right?


119
0:4:16,7 --> 0:4:18,535
- No, which is why
I was thinking


120
0:4:18,535 --> 0:4:21,171
that next Sunday,
you and I could go to no hitter,


121
0:4:21,171 --> 0:4:23,24
get the table
right next to his,


122
0:4:23,24 --> 0:4:26,209
and prove to him
that we fit in.


123
0:4:26,209 --> 0:4:29,246
- A little stalker-y,
don't you think?


124
0:4:29,246 --> 0:4:31,248
- You cannot stalk
your own husband.


125
0:4:31,248 --> 0:4:32,883
- Mm.


126
0:4:32,883 --> 0:4:38,622
You could be the first.


127
0:4:38,622 --> 0:4:39,99
- Ooh.


128
0:4:39,99 --> 0:4:41,992
Lord, I haven't slept
in a little boy's bed


129
0:4:41,992 --> 0:4:43,66
since you peed in mine
when you were five.


130
0:4:43,66 --> 0:4:45,762
Remember?


131
0:4:45,762 --> 0:4:47,464
- So what happened
at your old building?


132
0:4:47,464 --> 0:4:49,32
- Oh, they're tearing it down.


133
0:4:49,32 --> 0:4:51,468
Apparently some guy cut corners
when they were putting it up,


134
0:4:51,468 --> 0:4:53,403
so now the whole thing
is falling apart.


135
0:4:53,403 --> 0:4:55,138
- Sounds like Lindsay Lohan.


136
0:4:55,138 --> 0:4:57,341
- Uh...
- Hang on.


137
0:4:57,341 --> 0:4:59,376
- Well, you know,
it works for me.


138
0:4:59,376 --> 0:5:1,812
I got temporary housing fees,
and with that money,


139
0:5:1,812 --> 0:5:4,481
I was able
to buy myself a new watch.


140
0:5:4,481 --> 0:5:5,515
Bam!


141
0:5:5,515 --> 0:5:6,683
- Ooh.


142
0:5:6,683 --> 0:5:7,851
Don't tell Suzanne about that.


143
0:5:7,851 --> 0:5:9,186
She might try to put you out.


144
0:5:9,186 --> 0:5:11,488
- Hmm, I wish she'd try.


145
0:5:11,488 --> 0:5:12,656
- Hey, Marilyn, can you...


146
0:5:12,656 --> 0:5:14,558
- I know. You want me
to take you shopping.


147
0:5:14,558 --> 0:5:16,493
- I've been saving up
to buy something.


148
0:5:16,493 --> 0:5:18,395
- Saving up?
I'm impressed.


149
0:5:18,395 --> 0:5:19,796
What is it?


150
0:5:19,796 --> 0:5:22,232
- A pair of baby puff pants.


151
0:5:22,232 --> 0:5:23,533
- What is a baby puff?


152
0:5:23,533 --> 0:5:24,868
- It's P. Diddy's daughter.


153
0:5:24,868 --> 0:5:26,3
She has her own clothing line.


154
0:5:26,3 --> 0:5:27,137
- What's in the collection,


155
0:5:27,137 --> 0:5:29,84
leather onesies
and platinum sippy cups?


156
0:5:29,84 --> 0:5:32,9
- How much
do these things cost anyway?


157
0:5:32,9 --> 0:5:33,21
- $150.


158
0:5:33,21 --> 0:5:35,78
- $150?


159
0:5:35,78 --> 0:5:36,58
I'm not letting you
spend that money


160
0:5:36,58 --> 0:5:37,881
on some baby pants.


161
0:5:37,881 --> 0:5:39,783
- Girl, I can make
that outfit for $20.


162
0:5:39,783 --> 0:5:42,152
All I need is some fabric and my.


163
0:5:42,152 --> 0:5:43,22
- Really?


164
0:5:43,22 --> 0:5:44,388
You can make clothes?


165
0:5:44,388 --> 0:5:45,956
- Where do you think
they come from?


166
0:5:45,956 --> 0:5:47,891
- Stores.


167
0:5:47,891 --> 0:5:56,299
- I told you not to put
these kids in public school.


168
0:5:56,299 --> 0:6:0,804
- Hey, mom.


169
0:6:0,804 --> 0:6:3,206
- Kevin, what are you doing?


170
0:6:3,206 --> 0:6:4,474
- I'm building a tent,


171
0:6:4,474 --> 0:6:6,71
because one day,
the world's gonna end,


172
0:6:6,71 --> 0:6:8,912
and we're gonna be roaming
the streets like nomads.


173
0:6:8,912 --> 0:6:10,414
Only the strong will survive,


174
0:6:10,414 --> 0:6:12,449
and I'll be ready.


175
0:6:12,449 --> 0:6:13,75
Can you open this?


176
0:6:13,75 --> 0:6:19,89
- No.


177
0:6:19,89 --> 0:6:20,957
- Hey, baby.


178
0:6:20,957 --> 0:6:23,6
- Did you tell him
he could do that?


179
0:6:23,6 --> 0:6:24,94
- Yeah.


180
0:6:24,94 --> 0:6:25,996
He wanted to sleep
under a bush outside.


181
0:6:25,996 --> 0:6:27,864
- Well, I would have
appreciated it


182
0:6:27,864 --> 0:6:30,133
if you had talked to me
about it.


183
0:6:30,133 --> 0:6:32,736
Or maybe this is another one
of those conversations


184
0:6:32,736 --> 0:6:36,6
you can only have
with your boys.


185
0:6:36,6 --> 0:6:38,108
- All right.


186
0:6:38,108 --> 0:6:39,81
Game, set.


187
0:6:39,81 --> 0:6:40,844
Uh.


188
0:6:40,844 --> 0:6:42,646
Match.


189
0:6:42,646 --> 0:6:45,148
But you are being unreasonable.


190
0:6:45,148 --> 0:6:47,284
- I'm not being unreasonable.


191
0:6:47,284 --> 0:6:49,352
- Okay, you're not.


192
0:6:49,352 --> 0:6:50,787
- Don't patronize me.


193
0:6:50,787 --> 0:6:52,589
- I'm not patronizing you.


194
0:6:52,589 --> 0:6:54,257
I'm agreeing with you.


195
0:6:54,257 --> 0:6:56,626
- But if you don't believe
in what you're agreeing to,


196
0:6:56,626 --> 0:6:58,261
then you're patronizing me,


197
0:6:58,261 --> 0:7:0,197
and I don't want you
to give up your principles


198
0:7:0,197 --> 0:7:1,498
just to please me


199
0:7:1,498 --> 0:7:4,234
or start lying to me
and doing things behind my back


200
0:7:4,234 --> 0:7:6,236
because you think
I can't handle the truth.


201
0:7:6,236 --> 0:7:7,771
Nick, I married you
for who you are.


202
0:7:7,771 --> 0:7:9,406
- What are you talking about?


203
0:7:9,406 --> 0:7:10,674
I mean, are we arguing?


204
0:7:10,674 --> 0:7:12,409
Are we agreeing? What?


205
0:7:12,409 --> 0:7:14,411
- You want me to take you
back through it?


206
0:7:14,411 --> 0:7:15,679
- No, no, look.


207
0:7:15,679 --> 0:7:18,815
Do you want to come watch
the game with us on Sunday?


208
0:7:18,815 --> 0:7:20,55
- Are you asking me?


209
0:7:20,55 --> 0:7:22,85
- I thought
that's what I just did.


210
0:7:22,85 --> 0:7:24,488
- No, you asked me
if I wanted to come.


211
0:7:24,488 --> 0:7:26,69
You didn't say
you wanted me to come.


212
0:7:26,69 --> 0:7:28,425
- Okay.


213
0:7:28,425 --> 0:7:32,195
Suzanne, I would like for you
to come watch the game


214
0:7:32,195 --> 0:7:35,499
with me and the boys on Sunday.


215
0:7:35,499 --> 0:7:37,467
Would you like to go with me?


216
0:7:37,467 --> 0:7:39,603
- Why you got to say it
like I'm two?


217
0:7:39,603 --> 0:7:41,104
Okay, okay.


218
0:7:41,104 --> 0:7:42,205
I'm just playing.


219
0:7:42,205 --> 0:7:44,74
Yes, thank you.


220
0:7:44,74 --> 0:7:47,11
I would love to come.


221
0:7:47,11 --> 0:7:51,281
[Chuckles]


222
0:7:51,281 --> 0:8:0,992
- Man, she got all up
in your head.


223
0:8:0,992 --> 0:8:3,38
-Day six.


224
0:8:3,38 --> 0:8:5,474
- It's getting rough out here.


225
0:8:5,474 --> 0:8:9,544
I miss my family and...


226
0:8:9,544 --> 0:8:12,247
I'm almost out of honey o's.


227
0:8:12,247 --> 0:8:16,985
[Mechanical whirring]


228
0:8:16,985 --> 0:8:18,153
- Wow.


229
0:8:18,153 --> 0:8:19,588
You're good at that.


230
0:8:19,588 --> 0:8:20,856
Where'd you learn how to sew?


231
0:8:20,856 --> 0:8:22,57
- School.


232
0:8:22,57 --> 0:8:23,992
They used
to actually teach you stuff.


233
0:8:23,992 --> 0:8:25,394
See, you used
to get out of school,


234
0:8:25,394 --> 0:8:27,296
you had a diploma,
could get a job,


235
0:8:27,296 --> 0:8:28,664
and lead a life.


236
0:8:28,664 --> 0:8:29,798
Now you get out of school,


237
0:8:29,798 --> 0:8:31,933
you're in debt, dumb,
and back at home.


238
0:8:31,933 --> 0:8:33,368
- What's a diploma?


239
0:8:33,368 --> 0:8:35,537
- Oh, lord.


240
0:8:35,537 --> 0:8:38,106
Anyway, we didn't wear
designers back then.


241
0:8:38,106 --> 0:8:40,42
And there was none
of this shopping all year long.


242
0:8:40,42 --> 0:8:42,411
Oh, no, you got your new clothes
at the end of August,


243
0:8:42,411 --> 0:8:44,613
and they had to last you
the whole year.


244
0:8:44,613 --> 0:8:46,315
- But what if they went
out of style?


245
0:8:46,315 --> 0:8:47,883
- Then you went
right with them.


246
0:8:47,883 --> 0:8:49,551
[Both chuckle]


247
0:8:49,551 --> 0:8:51,72
- Excuse me, ma'am.


248
0:8:51,72 --> 0:8:54,122
Mind if you use your plug?


249
0:8:54,122 --> 0:8:55,657
- What you supposed to be?


250
0:8:55,657 --> 0:8:57,59
- The future.


251
0:8:57,59 --> 0:9:0,95
- Go ahead.


252
0:9:0,95 --> 0:9:2,97
See, that's the problem
with imagination.


253
0:9:2,97 --> 0:9:5,967
- [Chuckles]


254
0:9:5,967 --> 0:9:8,67
[All cheering]


255
0:9:8,67 --> 0:9:9,838
- Oh.
- Oh.


256
0:9:9,838 --> 0:9:11,873
- [Scoffs] Can I get
you guys something else?


257
0:9:11,873 --> 0:9:15,277
- <i>Si, si,</i> a plate of nachos,
<i>por favor.</i>


258
0:9:15,277 --> 0:9:16,945
- I'm not Spanish.


259
0:9:16,945 --> 0:9:18,947
- I know, but you got me
speaking in tongues.


260
0:9:18,947 --> 0:9:21,85
- Man, I would love
to get lost at sea with you.


261
0:9:21,85 --> 0:9:24,186
- In that scenario,
we'd both end up dead.


262
0:9:24,186 --> 0:9:26,722
- Listen, I want to apologize
for the behavior of my friends.


263
0:9:26,722 --> 0:9:28,657
It's their make-a-wish day.


264
0:9:28,657 --> 0:9:29,925
But if you'd like
to get together


265
0:9:29,925 --> 0:9:32,27
and I could apologize
more, you know, vigorously...


266
0:9:32,27 --> 0:9:33,628
- Whatever, Robin Thicke.


267
0:9:33,628 --> 0:9:34,796
Walking away.


268
0:9:34,796 --> 0:9:36,198
- Watching you walk.


269
0:9:36,198 --> 0:9:37,799
- Hey, hey, hey.


270
0:9:37,799 --> 0:9:39,434
All: Hey.
- Look who I got with me.


271
0:9:39,434 --> 0:9:40,869
Hoo-hoo.
- Hi.


272
0:9:40,869 --> 0:9:41,87
- Hey, guys.


273
0:9:41,87 --> 0:9:42,904
- What's up, guys?


274
0:9:42,904 --> 0:9:43,972
[Clears throat]


275
0:9:43,972 --> 0:9:45,307
- There you go, 'zanne.


276
0:9:45,307 --> 0:9:47,509
- Nick, you didn't mention
you were bringing Suzanne.


277
0:9:47,509 --> 0:9:49,144
- Ah, you know, it's funny.


278
0:9:49,144 --> 0:9:50,712
Nick didn't want me to come,


279
0:9:50,712 --> 0:9:53,582
but I said,
"I like your friends.


280
0:9:53,582 --> 0:9:55,5
I like basketball."


281
0:9:55,5 --> 0:9:56,184
I thought this would be fun.


282
0:9:56,184 --> 0:9:57,753
- Well, good for you.


283
0:9:57,753 --> 0:9:59,121
- Great story.


284
0:9:59,121 --> 0:10:2,224
Um, Nick,
I have got to show you


285
0:10:2,224 --> 0:10:4,59
this autographed Jersey
they have out front.


286
0:10:4,59 --> 0:10:5,127
- I saw it on the way in.


287
0:10:5,127 --> 0:10:11,299
- No, you didn't.
This way, please.


288
0:10:11,299 --> 0:10:12,801
What the hell
is wrong with you, man?


289
0:10:12,801 --> 0:10:14,936
- You heard her.
I told her not to come.


290
0:10:14,936 --> 0:10:16,738
- Well, then what is she
doing here?


291
0:10:16,738 --> 0:10:19,241
- I asked her to come.


292
0:10:19,241 --> 0:10:20,809
- Why would you do that?


293
0:10:20,809 --> 0:10:22,944
- Dude, I'm married.


294
0:10:22,944 --> 0:10:29,684
Now, where's
this autographed Jersey?


295
0:10:29,684 --> 0:10:31,453
[All cheering]


296
0:10:31,453 --> 0:10:32,621
- Oh, yes, baby.


297
0:10:32,621 --> 0:10:33,622
- Whoo.


298
0:10:33,622 --> 0:10:34,856
- That's what I'm talking about.


299
0:10:34,856 --> 0:10:35,891
- Here you go, sweetie.


300
0:10:35,891 --> 0:10:37,926
- Uh, <i>gracias.</i>


301
0:10:37,926 --> 0:10:40,262
- Does your wife know
you speak Spanish?


302
0:10:40,262 --> 0:10:42,731
- Uh, <i>no comprende?</i>


303
0:10:42,731 --> 0:10:44,666
- [Chuckles] "Sweetie," huh?


304
0:10:44,666 --> 0:10:46,67
[Laughs]


305
0:10:46,67 --> 0:10:47,969
Somebody's looking
for a big tip.


306
0:10:47,969 --> 0:10:48,97
Ooh!


307
0:10:48,97 --> 0:10:49,971
- Oh!


308
0:10:49,971 --> 0:10:51,139
- Did you guys see that?


309
0:10:51,139 --> 0:10:52,14
All: No.


310
0:10:52,14 --> 0:10:55,243
- Oh.


311
0:10:55,243 --> 0:10:56,478
- Oh, damn.


312
0:10:56,478 --> 0:10:58,48
- Rondo is playing
like a little girl.


313
0:10:58,48 --> 0:11:0,348
Why doesn't he just take it
to the hole?


314
0:11:0,348 --> 0:11:2,751
- Because every time he does,
they put him on his back.


315
0:11:2,751 --> 0:11:3,752
- Thank you.


316
0:11:3,752 --> 0:11:4,753
- I like the kid.


317
0:11:4,753 --> 0:11:5,987
- Me too.


318
0:11:5,987 --> 0:11:9,224
- Ten bucks says he scores
next time up the floor.


319
0:11:9,224 --> 0:11:10,325
- Definitely.


320
0:11:10,325 --> 0:11:11,76
- I'm in.
I want some of that action.


321
0:11:11,76 --> 0:11:13,728
- Okay, y'all must like
losing your money.


322
0:11:13,728 --> 0:11:16,131
Honey, can I have $10?


323
0:11:16,131 --> 0:11:20,469
- [Chortles]


324
0:11:20,469 --> 0:11:23,772
- Yes!
- Oh, man.


325
0:11:23,772 --> 0:11:26,7
- You're gonna give me a chance
to win my money back, right?


326
0:11:26,7 --> 0:11:28,543
- All right, Danny DeVito,
trying to man up.


327
0:11:28,543 --> 0:11:32,314
- [Chuckles]


328
0:11:32,314 --> 0:11:34,416
- Ten bucks says that's a ten.


329
0:11:34,416 --> 0:11:37,819
- No way.
I'm taking that bet.


330
0:11:37,819 --> 0:11:39,421
- [Chuckles] Booyah.


331
0:11:39,421 --> 0:11:41,22
[Laughs]


332
0:11:41,22 --> 0:11:43,291
[Humming rhythmically]


333
0:11:43,291 --> 0:11:45,994
What? What?


334
0:11:45,994 --> 0:11:47,796
20 bucks that's a charge.


335
0:11:47,796 --> 0:11:48,864
- No, no way.


336
0:11:48,864 --> 0:11:51,266
- All right,
that's my last $20.


337
0:11:51,266 --> 0:11:52,267
- Ha!


338
0:11:52,267 --> 0:11:53,301
- Oh, my God.


339
0:11:53,301 --> 0:11:54,336
- Come to mama.


340
0:11:54,336 --> 0:11:55,604
- That's it.
I'm done. No more.


341
0:11:55,604 --> 0:11:56,605
- Me too.


342
0:11:56,605 --> 0:11:57,672
- What about you, Martin?


343
0:11:57,672 --> 0:11:59,241
You want to go again,
double or nothing?


344
0:11:59,241 --> 0:12:1,109
- Uh, I think I'm gonna have
to go with nothing.


345
0:12:1,109 --> 0:12:2,544
I am Toni Braxton broke.


346
0:12:2,544 --> 0:12:3,578
- [Groans]


347
0:12:3,578 --> 0:12:4,946
- Well, I guess we're done here.


348
0:12:4,946 --> 0:12:6,47
I'll see you guys next week.


349
0:12:6,47 --> 0:12:8,16
- Yeah, definitely.


350
0:12:8,16 --> 0:12:12,2
- All right, guys.
- Yeah, see you later, Nick.


351
0:12:12,2 --> 0:12:13,989
- [Chuckling] That was fun.


352
0:12:13,989 --> 0:12:21,162
- Yeah.


353
0:12:21,162 --> 0:12:23,698
- Hey, guys.
We're home.


354
0:12:23,698 --> 0:12:24,699
- Hey, everybody.


355
0:12:24,699 --> 0:12:27,836
Hey, Kevin.


356
0:12:27,836 --> 0:12:30,438
- So how was the game?


357
0:12:30,438 --> 0:12:32,14
- Oh, it was good.


358
0:12:32,14 --> 0:12:33,708
- Ooh.


359
0:12:33,708 --> 0:12:35,51
[Chuckles]


360
0:12:35,51 --> 0:12:39,247
- Mom, dad,
look what me and Marilyn made.


361
0:12:39,247 --> 0:12:42,217
- Oh, my God,
those are amazing.


362
0:12:42,217 --> 0:12:43,351
You made those, Marilyn?


363
0:12:43,351 --> 0:12:44,419
- That's right.


364
0:12:44,419 --> 0:12:46,121
Stick with me.
You might learn something.


365
0:12:46,121 --> 0:12:47,188
- I can't believe it.


366
0:12:47,188 --> 0:12:49,124
They look just like
the real baby puffs.


367
0:12:49,124 --> 0:12:51,359
But here's the best part.


368
0:12:51,359 --> 0:12:52,36
Bam!


369
0:12:52,36 --> 0:12:54,262
I got my own designer logo.


370
0:12:54,262 --> 0:12:55,196
- Go take those off.


371
0:12:55,196 --> 0:12:57,198
I need to finish
the inside seams.


372
0:12:57,198 --> 0:12:58,199
- Okay.


373
0:12:58,199 --> 0:12:59,701
- Nice work, Marilyn.


374
0:12:59,701 --> 0:13:1,436
- You're lucky
I'm staying here,


375
0:13:1,436 --> 0:13:5,273
or I'd be charging you a grip.


376
0:13:5,273 --> 0:13:6,975
- Today was a good day.


377
0:13:6,975 --> 0:13:8,743
Plus, I got some spa money.


378
0:13:8,743 --> 0:13:12,747
- I am tickled pink
that you had a good time.


379
0:13:12,747 --> 0:13:14,482
- Oh, come on.


380
0:13:14,482 --> 0:13:16,217
Don't pout.


381
0:13:16,217 --> 0:13:17,185
Admit it.


382
0:13:17,185 --> 0:13:19,154
The guys had a blast,
and you know it.


383
0:13:19,154 --> 0:13:20,655
- It may have looked
that way to you,


384
0:13:20,655 --> 0:13:21,756
but what you just witnessed


385
0:13:21,756 --> 0:13:23,992
was a master performance
of a show called


386
0:13:23,992 --> 0:13:26,394
"men holding back
'cause a woman was there."


387
0:13:26,394 --> 0:13:28,63
- [Chuckles] Okay.


388
0:13:28,63 --> 0:13:31,766
You are just mad
because you wanted it to suck


389
0:13:31,766 --> 0:13:33,501
and it didn't.


390
0:13:33,501 --> 0:13:35,437
- You wouldn't say that
if it was you.


391
0:13:35,437 --> 0:13:37,5
- Oh, no, see,
that's where you're wrong,


392
0:13:37,5 --> 0:13:39,74
because women don't need
to change their behavior


393
0:13:39,74 --> 0:13:41,109
just because
there's a man in the room.


394
0:13:41,109 --> 0:13:43,111
Now, if you'll excuse me,


395
0:13:43,111 --> 0:13:45,814
I have some spa appointments
to book.


396
0:13:45,814 --> 0:13:47,282
Oh.


397
0:13:47,282 --> 0:13:52,721
And I want my $65.


398
0:13:52,721 --> 0:13:54,155
- <i>Buenos dias,</i> ladies.


399
0:13:54,155 --> 0:13:57,158
- Hi.


400
0:13:57,158 --> 0:14:0,128
<i>- Gracias.</i>
<i>- De nada.</i>


401
0:14:0,128 --> 0:14:2,33
For you?


402
0:14:2,33 --> 0:14:3,665
- Thank you.


403
0:14:3,665 --> 0:14:7,902
- You're very welcome.
<i>Chbo.</i>


404
0:14:7,902 --> 0:14:9,871
- I love this spa.


405
0:14:9,871 --> 0:14:11,6
- Mm.
- Ooh.


406
0:14:11,6 --> 0:14:12,874
That boy would make me
get my weave wet.


407
0:14:12,874 --> 0:14:14,175
[Laughter]


408
0:14:14,175 --> 0:14:15,143
- And I know he broke,


409
0:14:15,143 --> 0:14:18,813
but he almost makes me
want to slum it.


410
0:14:18,813 --> 0:14:20,148
[Chuckles]


411
0:14:20,148 --> 0:14:21,95
- Well, I'm glad I don't know
what his name is,


412
0:14:21,95 --> 0:14:24,185
'cause I might accidentally
say it in my sleep.


413
0:14:24,185 --> 0:14:25,286
[Laughter]


414
0:14:25,286 --> 0:14:27,55
- For the purpose
of this conversation,


415
0:14:27,55 --> 0:14:28,69
let's just call him...


416
0:14:28,69 --> 0:14:29,791
Nick!


417
0:14:29,791 --> 0:14:32,193
- Nick, hi.


418
0:14:32,193 --> 0:14:33,161
- Hey.


419
0:14:33,161 --> 0:14:40,378
Who's ready to get pampered?


420
0:14:40,378 --> 0:14:43,248
- Avocado hot stone
shiatsu massage.


421
0:14:43,248 --> 0:14:45,15
Whoo, that sounds messy.


422
0:14:45,15 --> 0:14:46,785
What are you guys gonna do?


423
0:14:46,785 --> 0:14:51,556
- Uh, I'm getting
the Nicky massage.


424
0:14:51,556 --> 0:14:52,824
- I'm getting the first lady,


425
0:14:52,824 --> 0:14:54,793
and my cousin here
is going for Oprah's big "o."


426
0:14:54,793 --> 0:14:56,6
- It's organic.


427
0:14:56,6 --> 0:14:58,96
- Mm, that sounds good.


428
0:14:58,96 --> 0:15:1,433
- Oh, Suzanne, look,
cucumber water.


429
0:15:1,433 --> 0:15:2,4
- I have water.


430
0:15:2,4 --> 0:15:4,102
- No, no, not this water.


431
0:15:4,102 --> 0:15:6,204
What's wrong with your man?
- What?


432
0:15:6,204 --> 0:15:8,306
- You know Jevonne's boyfriend
just cheated on her.


433
0:15:8,306 --> 0:15:9,774
I mean, we're trying
to cheer her up.


434
0:15:9,774 --> 0:15:11,242
We can't do that
with your man here.


435
0:15:11,242 --> 0:15:12,71
- Well, I didn't know
he was coming.


436
0:15:12,71 --> 0:15:14,212
- How can you not know
he was coming?


437
0:15:14,212 --> 0:15:15,313
- He's my husband.


438
0:15:15,313 --> 0:15:18,82
How am I supposed to know
what he's doing?


439
0:15:18,82 --> 0:15:19,284
Is that the cucumber water?


440
0:15:19,284 --> 0:15:23,855
- Girl, sit down.


441
0:15:23,855 --> 0:15:25,123
- So what do you say, spalding?


442
0:15:25,123 --> 0:15:26,958
You want to surf the web?


443
0:15:26,958 --> 0:15:29,828
No?


444
0:15:29,828 --> 0:15:31,696
Yeah, you're right.


445
0:15:31,696 --> 0:15:35,4
I guess I do need
to conserve the battery.


446
0:15:35,4 --> 0:15:37,635
How about just one video?


447
0:15:37,635 --> 0:15:40,772
Let's go for a classic.


448
0:15:40,772 --> 0:15:41,973
Let's see.


449
0:15:41,973 --> 0:15:43,675
I used to listen to this song
when I was a kid.


450
0:15:43,675 --> 0:15:46,344
It's called <i>the good life.</i>


451
0:15:46,344 --> 0:15:48,79
It's good, right?


452
0:15:48,79 --> 0:15:49,28
Shh.


453
0:15:49,28 --> 0:15:54,752
Try not to sing so loud.


454
0:15:54,752 --> 0:15:57,21
- Kevin.


455
0:15:57,21 --> 0:15:58,523
- Shh.


456
0:15:58,523 --> 0:16:0,658
- I know you're in there.


457
0:16:0,658 --> 0:16:2,227
- We don't want no trouble.


458
0:16:2,227 --> 0:16:3,595
Ain't got nothing here for you.


459
0:16:3,595 --> 0:16:5,93
And I'm telling you,
you don't want to come check.


460
0:16:5,93 --> 0:16:6,998
- Whatever.


461
0:16:6,998 --> 0:16:8,566
When Marilyn wakes up
from her nap,


462
0:16:8,566 --> 0:16:10,668
tell her I went to the mall.


463
0:16:10,668 --> 0:16:11,703
[Door clicks shut]


464
0:16:11,703 --> 0:16:12,971
- [Exhales sharply]


465
0:16:12,971 --> 0:16:16,741
It's about to get violent.


466
0:16:16,741 --> 0:16:17,775
- Ooh.


467
0:16:17,775 --> 0:16:21,145
Now, this would look good
on your toes.


468
0:16:21,145 --> 0:16:22,647
- Mojo melon, huh?


469
0:16:22,647 --> 0:16:24,816
Uh, okay.


470
0:16:24,816 --> 0:16:28,52
Suzanne, you didn't tell me
Nick knows so much about toes.


471
0:16:28,52 --> 0:16:29,487
- I didn't know.


472
0:16:29,487 --> 0:16:31,623
- I didn't think most black men
cared about feet at all


473
0:16:31,623 --> 0:16:33,91
till we saw <i>boomerang.</i>


474
0:16:33,91 --> 0:16:35,193
That changed everything.


475
0:16:35,193 --> 0:16:36,16
- Oh, my God.


476
0:16:36,16 --> 0:16:37,228
<i>Boomerang.</i>


477
0:16:37,228 --> 0:16:38,496
[Laughs] Eddie Murphy.


478
0:16:38,496 --> 0:16:40,164
Oh, for years,
I wouldn't date anybody


479
0:16:40,164 --> 0:16:41,599
that didn't have a mustache.


480
0:16:41,599 --> 0:16:43,201
All that chocolate.


481
0:16:43,201 --> 0:16:44,536
- Can you believe Halle Berry


482
0:16:44,536 --> 0:16:46,371
played the plain girl
in that movie?


483
0:16:46,371 --> 0:16:47,472
- I know, right?


484
0:16:47,472 --> 0:16:48,806
And earth a kitt.


485
0:16:48,806 --> 0:16:52,844
"I am not wearing
any panties, Marcus."


486
0:16:52,844 --> 0:17:0,818
[Laughing]


487
0:17:0,818 --> 0:17:2,12
You put this on,


488
0:17:2,12 --> 0:17:4,355
me and your toes are gonna need
a moment to ourselves.


489
0:17:4,355 --> 0:17:6,357
- [Laughs]


490
0:17:6,357 --> 0:17:10,61
- Oh, here.


491
0:17:10,61 --> 0:17:11,796
[Scoffs] Look at this.


492
0:17:11,796 --> 0:17:13,64
Another reality show...


493
0:17:13,64 --> 0:17:15,133
<i>Real housewives of hip-hop.</i>


494
0:17:15,133 --> 0:17:16,367
- What?


495
0:17:16,367 --> 0:17:18,57
Now, you know there only
but three wives in all of rap.


496
0:17:18,57 --> 0:17:21,372
Everybody else
is just a baby mama.


497
0:17:21,372 --> 0:17:22,907
That's what they should
name the show,


498
0:17:22,907 --> 0:17:24,375
<i>the real House of baby mamas.</i>


499
0:17:24,375 --> 0:17:25,777
- [Laughs]


500
0:17:25,777 --> 0:17:28,112
- See, I couldn't have
all those cameras in my house.


501
0:17:28,112 --> 0:17:30,682
- Oh, they might catch
some of that toe activity.


502
0:17:30,682 --> 0:17:32,283
- How are you doing,
<i>señoritas?</i>


503
0:17:32,283 --> 0:17:34,285
- Good.
- Ooh, I'm great.


504
0:17:34,285 --> 0:17:35,587
- Fine.


505
0:17:35,587 --> 0:17:38,59
- Fantastic. I'll be back
to check on you in a few.


506
0:17:38,59 --> 0:17:39,891
- Those pants are tight.


507
0:17:39,891 --> 0:17:41,326
- I know.


508
0:17:41,326 --> 0:17:43,628
- Those pants make skinny jeans
look like sweats.


509
0:17:43,628 --> 0:17:45,196
- I know.


510
0:17:45,196 --> 0:17:46,497
- And that shirt was so tight,


511
0:17:46,497 --> 0:17:48,633
I bet he could only breathe
through one lung at a time.


512
0:17:48,633 --> 0:17:50,34
[Hyperventilating]


513
0:17:50,34 --> 0:17:51,135
[Laughter]


514
0:17:51,135 --> 0:17:52,303
Look, you do push-ups, dude.


515
0:17:52,303 --> 0:17:53,671
We get it, all right?


516
0:17:53,671 --> 0:17:55,406
The auditions for <i>twilight</i>
are over.


517
0:17:55,406 --> 0:17:56,441
- Right.


518
0:17:56,441 --> 0:17:57,609
- Shamar Moore called.


519
0:17:57,609 --> 0:17:59,51
He wants to challenge you
to a eyebrow wax-off.


520
0:17:59,51 --> 0:18:0,545
- Oh, that's funny.


521
0:18:0,545 --> 0:18:2,246
- You can't get tighter
than that.


522
0:18:2,246 --> 0:18:3,414
It's impossible.


523
0:18:3,414 --> 0:18:4,682
- It's ridiculous.


524
0:18:4,682 --> 0:18:6,15
- Nick?


525
0:18:6,15 --> 0:18:8,486
We're ready for your pedicure.


526
0:18:8,486 --> 0:18:9,487
- [Grunts]


527
0:18:9,487 --> 0:18:11,856
- Uh, you're getting
a pedicure?


528
0:18:11,856 --> 0:18:13,658
- Well, I was gonna get
some of these lumps


529
0:18:13,658 --> 0:18:15,93
on my head worked on,


530
0:18:15,93 --> 0:18:18,229
but getting my feet cleaned up
just seemed like the way to go.


531
0:18:18,229 --> 0:18:19,497
[Laughs]


532
0:18:19,497 --> 0:18:20,798
All right, ladies,


533
0:18:20,798 --> 0:18:22,3
I will see you
on the other side.


534
0:18:22,3 --> 0:18:23,401
- All right.


535
0:18:23,401 --> 0:18:25,3
- Next time, bring you.


536
0:18:25,3 --> 0:18:26,304
Uh, uh, uh.


537
0:18:26,304 --> 0:18:28,139
- Oh, let's make a plan.


538
0:18:28,139 --> 0:18:29,173
You better work.


539
0:18:29,173 --> 0:18:30,375
[Laughs] Look at him.


540
0:18:30,375 --> 0:18:31,476
He looks so funny.


541
0:18:31,476 --> 0:18:32,543
[Laughs]


542
0:18:32,543 --> 0:18:34,846
Bye, Nick.


543
0:18:34,846 --> 0:18:43,645
- Hey.


544
0:18:43,645 --> 0:18:44,712
- Hey.


545
0:18:44,712 --> 0:18:46,514
- Hey, sweetie.
Look at you.


546
0:18:46,514 --> 0:18:47,582
[Both chuckle]


547
0:18:47,582 --> 0:18:48,65
- Marilyn, are you leaving?


548
0:18:48,65 --> 0:18:50,752
- Yeah, they got my place.


549
0:18:50,752 --> 0:18:53,488
And as sad as it makes me
to have to leave here,


550
0:18:53,488 --> 0:18:54,489
got to go.


551
0:18:54,489 --> 0:18:56,624
Fresh white carpet awaits.


552
0:18:56,624 --> 0:18:58,927
Hey, turn around here
and let me take a good look


553
0:18:58,927 --> 0:19:0,428
at your little fine self.


554
0:19:0,428 --> 0:19:2,397
That is a nice jacket.
Where'd you get it?


555
0:19:2,397 --> 0:19:4,566
- It's a baby puff.


556
0:19:4,566 --> 0:19:5,967
- For $100?


557
0:19:5,967 --> 0:19:7,802
- Since I saved the money
by making the pants,


558
0:19:7,802 --> 0:19:9,404
I got the jacket instead.


559
0:19:9,404 --> 0:19:12,206
- Lindsey, the only reason
I made you those pants


560
0:19:12,206 --> 0:19:13,741
was because I was trying
to teach you


561
0:19:13,741 --> 0:19:15,43
the value of a dollar.


562
0:19:15,43 --> 0:19:18,246
And then you turn around
and pay $100 for that?


563
0:19:18,246 --> 0:19:20,548
Girl, you missed
my point entirely.


564
0:19:20,548 --> 0:19:24,819
- I'm sorry, Marilyn, but you
kind of missed my point too.


565
0:19:24,819 --> 0:19:26,287
- And what would that be?


566
0:19:26,287 --> 0:19:29,824
- I wanted some baby puff.


567
0:19:29,824 --> 0:19:33,94
- You know, you ain't too old
to get choked.


568
0:19:33,94 --> 0:19:43,404
I'm surprised more kids
don't go missing.


569
0:19:43,404 --> 0:19:44,772
- Hey, babe.


570
0:19:44,772 --> 0:19:46,14
Where's Kevin?


571
0:19:46,14 --> 0:19:47,842
- Uh, he smelled.


572
0:19:47,842 --> 0:19:51,179
I made him take down his tent
and get in the shower.


573
0:19:51,179 --> 0:19:52,513
You look relaxed.


574
0:19:52,513 --> 0:19:54,482
- My feet feel so good
from that pedicure,


575
0:19:54,482 --> 0:19:55,75
I can't stand up.


576
0:19:55,75 --> 0:19:56,918
- [Laughs]


577
0:19:56,918 --> 0:19:59,821
- All that soaking,
massaging, moisturizing,


578
0:19:59,821 --> 0:20:1,889
clipping, buffing, polishing...


579
0:20:1,889 --> 0:20:4,392
I have never been treated
that nice in my life.


580
0:20:4,392 --> 0:20:6,661
- Well, I'm glad
that you had a good time.


581
0:20:6,661 --> 0:20:8,396
- I had a great time.


582
0:20:8,396 --> 0:20:11,532
But honestly, I was doing it
to get back at you.


583
0:20:11,532 --> 0:20:13,635
I thought I'd feel uncomfortable
around your girls,


584
0:20:13,635 --> 0:20:15,36
but they were cool.


585
0:20:15,36 --> 0:20:17,305
- No, they weren't,
and neither was I.


586
0:20:17,305 --> 0:20:19,14
Nick, you proved your point.


587
0:20:19,14 --> 0:20:22,377
I need to let you and your boys
hang and have fun.


588
0:20:22,377 --> 0:20:24,45
I'm sorry.


589
0:20:24,45 --> 0:20:25,713
- Hold on.


590
0:20:25,713 --> 0:20:27,749
Can you say that again?


591
0:20:27,749 --> 0:20:31,886
- Nick Kingston-persons,
I'm sorry.


592
0:20:31,886 --> 0:20:34,222
- An apology and a pedicure.


593
0:20:34,222 --> 0:20:36,658
Ooh, throw in a clock radio
and some socks,


594
0:20:36,658 --> 0:20:38,66
and I don't need another gift
till I retire.


595
0:20:38,66 --> 0:20:39,961
- [Chortles]


596
0:20:39,961 --> 0:20:44,699
Well, listen, I'm glad
that you had a great time.


597
0:20:44,699 --> 0:20:46,801
But I never want to see you
in that place again.


598
0:20:46,801 --> 0:20:49,17
- Can I go
when you're not there?


599
0:20:49,17 --> 0:20:50,672
- No.


600
0:20:50,672 --> 0:20:53,593
- What am I gonna tell
that white girl, then?


601
0:20:53,593 --> 0:20:55,592
[Applause]
