1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:11,68



2
0:0:11,68 --> 0:0:15,15
SHANE SMITH: This is a shrine
to Jesus Malverde, who's the


3
0:0:15,15 --> 0:0:18,88
patron saint of drug
smugglers, narcos.


4
0:0:18,88 --> 0:0:21,24
So we're going to
light a candle.


5
0:0:21,24 --> 0:0:23,91
This is freaking me out
because I'm very


6
0:0:23,91 --> 0:0:26,2
superstitious.


7
0:0:26,2 --> 0:0:26,87
That's him there.


8
0:0:26,87 --> 0:0:28,75
Patron saint of the
drug dealers.


9
0:0:28,75 --> 0:0:30,67
They all come in here.


10
0:0:30,67 --> 0:0:31,62
They say a prayer.


11
0:0:31,62 --> 0:0:34,95
They write a prayer on here and
they say, please let me


12
0:0:34,95 --> 0:0:38,2
get across the border
with my drugs.


13
0:0:38,2 --> 0:0:41,1
Literally, religion about
drug dealers.


14
0:0:41,1 --> 0:0:46,16



15
0:0:46,16 --> 0:0:48,39
Now the whole time I was hanging
out with the LeBarons,


16
0:0:48,39 --> 0:0:50,91
I found myself wondering, how
do you actually protect


17
0:0:50,91 --> 0:0:54,3
yourself against narco lords
who employ whole armies of


18
0:0:54,3 --> 0:0:58,81
assassins whose sole job is
to kill their rivals.


19
0:0:58,81 --> 0:1:1,74
Well, the LeBarons started by
adopting military-style


20
0:1:1,74 --> 0:1:4,65
tactics and setting up
checkpoints, roadblocks, and


21
0:1:4,65 --> 0:1:5,59
watch towers.


22
0:1:5,59 --> 0:1:7,71
BRENT LEBARON: We hit a real big
low, you know, when they


23
0:1:7,71 --> 0:1:8,45
killed Benjamin.


24
0:1:8,45 --> 0:1:11,51
It was a real big blow to
our entire community.


25
0:1:11,51 --> 0:1:11,967
SHANE SMITH: Right.


26
0:1:11,967 --> 0:1:16,17
BRENT LEBARON: I was really
close to Benjamin.


27
0:1:16,17 --> 0:1:17,33
Knew him really well.


28
0:1:17,33 --> 0:1:20,315
SHANE SMITH: After Benjamin was
killed, you set up your


29
0:1:20,315 --> 0:1:22,92
own community watch, your
own night watch.


30
0:1:22,92 --> 0:1:24,98
And then you built this
up and you have people


31
0:1:24,98 --> 0:1:26,17
watching every night.


32
0:1:26,17 --> 0:1:27,38
BRENT LEBARON: Every night.


33
0:1:27,38 --> 0:1:28,83
SHANE SMITH: What are
you watching for?


34
0:1:28,83 --> 0:1:32,18
BRENT LEBARON: Pretty much
suspicious vehicles.


35
0:1:32,18 --> 0:1:35,25
We pretty much know everybody,
and so if it looks like a


36
0:1:35,25 --> 0:1:37,3
vehicle I've never
seen before, then


37
0:1:37,3 --> 0:1:38,5
it was getting checked.


38
0:1:38,5 --> 0:1:41,8
SHANE SMITH: This watch hut
looks down on one of the main


39
0:1:41,8 --> 0:1:42,29
drug trafficking roads.


40
0:1:42,29 --> 0:1:43,45
BRENT LEBARON: One
of them, yeah.


41
0:1:43,45 --> 0:1:45,11
SHANE SMITH: The only
people here with


42
0:1:45,11 --> 0:1:47,66
weapons are the criminals.


43
0:1:47,66 --> 0:1:48,3
BRENT LEBARON: Pretty much.


44
0:1:48,3 --> 0:1:49,36
SHANE SMITH: The drug cartels.


45
0:1:49,36 --> 0:1:51,13
BRENT LEBARON: Rumor got out
that we had high-powered


46
0:1:51,13 --> 0:1:53,55
rifles and snipers
and whatnot.


47
0:1:53,55 --> 0:1:55,89
SHANE SMITH: And 50 cals
up here and stuff.


48
0:1:55,89 --> 0:1:58,71
BRENT LEBARON: Well you know
how rumors can spread.


49
0:1:58,71 --> 0:2:0,2
Which was a benefit for us.


50
0:2:0,2 --> 0:2:0,64
SHANE SMITH: Yeah, it's good.


51
0:2:0,64 --> 0:2:0,99
It's a good rumor.


52
0:2:0,99 --> 0:2:3,28
BRENT LEBARON: It was a really
good rumor for us.


53
0:2:3,28 --> 0:2:7,48
I believe that the watch tower
is one of the key points to


54
0:2:7,48 --> 0:2:9,979
keeping the bad guys
away from our town.


55
0:2:9,979 --> 0:2:13,89
Also the Feds and the military
are in our town.


56
0:2:13,89 --> 0:2:14,65
This is their base.


57
0:2:14,65 --> 0:2:17,94
We actually had a roadblock, to
where there was one way in


58
0:2:17,94 --> 0:2:19,35
and one way out.


59
0:2:19,35 --> 0:2:21,97
SHANE SMITH: So you have
barricades, checkpoints, and


60
0:2:21,97 --> 0:2:22,64
watch towers.


61
0:2:22,64 --> 0:2:23,75
BRENT LEBARON: Yeah.


62
0:2:23,75 --> 0:2:26,93
I would say our valley right
here is quite a bit safer than


63
0:2:26,93 --> 0:2:28,6
a lot of areas.


64
0:2:28,6 --> 0:2:30,21
SHANE SMITH: Casas Grandes,
which is about 30 minutes


65
0:2:30,21 --> 0:2:33,22
away, they're still having
kidnappings and stuff there.


66
0:2:33,22 --> 0:2:34,24
BRENT LEBARON: Here and there.


67
0:2:34,24 --> 0:2:38,42
Before it was literally
two, three a week.


68
0:2:38,42 --> 0:2:39,37
SHANE SMITH: Wow.


69
0:2:39,37 --> 0:2:40,3
It's a lot.


70
0:2:40,3 --> 0:2:41,36
BRENT LEBARON: That's
a lot, yeah.


71
0:2:41,36 --> 0:2:44,53
We were never pinpointing drug
cartels or anything else.


72
0:2:44,53 --> 0:2:48,42
But when it came to them now
kidnapping our family members,


73
0:2:48,42 --> 0:2:50,57
that's what we took
a stand against.


74
0:2:50,57 --> 0:2:53,22
When it comes to protecting our
family, if we have to die


75
0:2:53,22 --> 0:2:56,62
doing it, we're going to.


76
0:2:56,62 --> 0:2:58,47
SHANE SMITH: So the LeBarons
made their colony into a


77
0:2:58,47 --> 0:3:0,96
little fortress, using the
same counterterrorist


78
0:3:0,96 --> 0:3:4,62
techniques that the US Army uses
in Iraq and Afghanistan.


79
0:3:4,62 --> 0:3:6,97
And because of it, the killings
and the kidnappings


80
0:3:6,97 --> 0:3:9,65
in the Mormon areas actually
died down.


81
0:3:9,65 --> 0:3:12,6
But road blocks and security
checkpoints are only going to


82
0:3:12,6 --> 0:3:13,19
get you so far.


83
0:3:13,19 --> 0:3:15,67
At some point, if you're
fighting the narcos, you're


84
0:3:15,67 --> 0:3:17,41
going to need guns.


85
0:3:17,41 --> 0:3:20,89
If Benjamin was taken by a bunch
of guys with weapons--


86
0:3:20,89 --> 0:3:22,43
they were unarmed--


87
0:3:22,43 --> 0:3:24,38
how are you supposed
to defend yourself?


88
0:3:24,38 --> 0:3:26,81
CAR DRIVER: Well, there's really
no law in Mexico that


89
0:3:26,81 --> 0:3:29,63
gives you the right
to bear arms.


90
0:3:29,63 --> 0:3:32,57
Legally, the quickest
and the best way is


91
0:3:32,57 --> 0:3:34,4
through a gun club.


92
0:3:34,4 --> 0:3:35,69
SHANE SMITH: Now in
Mexico it's nearly


93
0:3:35,69 --> 0:3:37,33
impossible to own a gun.


94
0:3:37,33 --> 0:3:40,53
In fact, one of the only legal
ways to do so is to go through


95
0:3:40,53 --> 0:3:43,91
the extremely difficult process
of starting a gun club


96
0:3:43,91 --> 0:3:45,16
or a shooting range.


97
0:3:45,16 --> 0:3:51,55



98
0:3:51,55 --> 0:3:52,85
Why don't you have
your own shooting


99
0:3:52,85 --> 0:3:54,33
club in Colonia LeBaron?


100
0:3:54,33 --> 0:3:56,6
CAR DRIVER: Our ex-mayor
wouldn't sign


101
0:3:56,6 --> 0:3:57,46
the papers we needed.


102
0:3:57,46 --> 0:4:1,38
We had all the first
members on a list.


103
0:4:1,38 --> 0:4:3,3
Well, he turns around
and it shows it


104
0:4:3,3 --> 0:4:5,12
to our bad-boy buddies.


105
0:4:5,12 --> 0:4:7,5
SHANE SMITH: You're trying to
arm yourselves, and he's


106
0:4:7,5 --> 0:4:8,56
working for the cartel.


107
0:4:8,56 --> 0:4:10,9
So you can't arm yourselves.


108
0:4:10,9 --> 0:4:10,485
CAR DRIVER: Exactly.


109
0:4:10,485 --> 0:4:10,88
Pretty much.


110
0:4:10,88 --> 0:4:11,79
SHANE SMITH: Where is he now?


111
0:4:11,79 --> 0:4:13,4
CAR DRIVER: He's in prison.


112
0:4:13,4 --> 0:4:17,459



113
0:4:17,459 --> 0:4:20,13
SHANE SMITH: There's 15 million
illegal assault rifles


114
0:4:20,13 --> 0:4:21,81
estimated in Mexico.


115
0:4:21,81 --> 0:4:23,597
I mean, the thing is,
if you have 20 guys


116
0:4:23,597 --> 0:4:24,847
with assault rifles--


117
0:4:24,847 --> 0:4:26,95



118
0:4:26,95 --> 0:4:30,67
I think I'm going to go for
one of those turkeys.


119
0:4:30,67 --> 0:4:34,78
Oh yeah, I'm going to
get one of them.


120
0:4:34,78 --> 0:4:37,35
So the LeBarons finally decided
that if it continued


121
0:4:37,35 --> 0:4:40,28
to be illegal to own weapons,
which meant criminals were the


122
0:4:40,28 --> 0:4:43,5
only ones that had guns, that it
was time to change the law.


123
0:4:43,5 --> 0:4:50,39



124
0:4:50,39 --> 0:4:53,63
Alex LeBaron, who is now a
Congressman, is determined to


125
0:4:53,63 --> 0:4:55,71
protect his colony from
the cartels, no


126
0:4:55,71 --> 0:4:57,1
matter what it takes.


127
0:4:57,1 --> 0:5:0,54
Even if it means a shoot out
with the Mexican military.


128
0:5:0,54 --> 0:5:2,2
ALEX LEBARON: They went
into our farm.


129
0:5:2,2 --> 0:5:3,3
We thought they were
criminals.


130
0:5:3,3 --> 0:5:4,35
We shot one of them.


131
0:5:4,35 --> 0:5:6,64
It was a very sad incident,
but it gained a lot


132
0:5:6,64 --> 0:5:7,46
of respect for us.


133
0:5:7,46 --> 0:5:8,74
SHANE SMITH: You outshot
the military.


134
0:5:8,74 --> 0:5:9,86
ALEX LEBARON: We outshot
the military.


135
0:5:9,86 --> 0:5:13,15
We got phone calls from heads of
the criminal organizations


136
0:5:13,15 --> 0:5:14,48
after that incident.


137
0:5:14,48 --> 0:5:17,49
And they told us they were proud
of us to some degree.


138
0:5:17,49 --> 0:5:19,46
People in drug organizations--


139
0:5:19,46 --> 0:5:21,42
and including in the same
military-- know that we have


140
0:5:21,42 --> 0:5:23,4
weapons, because we've
been saying it.


141
0:5:23,4 --> 0:5:23,63
SHANE SMITH: Sure.


142
0:5:23,63 --> 0:5:25,84
ALEX LEBARON: We have illegal
weapons in our community.


143
0:5:25,84 --> 0:5:26,86
Come in and find them
if you want.


144
0:5:26,86 --> 0:5:27,83
We buy them in the States.


145
0:5:27,83 --> 0:5:29,37
We know we traffic
them illegally.


146
0:5:29,37 --> 0:5:30,8
But that's the only
way to defend


147
0:5:30,8 --> 0:5:32,79
yourself in this country.


148
0:5:32,79 --> 0:5:35,27
In order to get access to a
weapon in our country it would


149
0:5:35,27 --> 0:5:37,545
cost you up to $10,000, and that
wouldn't even be through


150
0:5:37,545 --> 0:5:38,5
a legal way.


151
0:5:38,5 --> 0:5:40,62
SHANE SMITH: So the majority of
the weapons being used by


152
0:5:40,62 --> 0:5:41,26
the narcos--


153
0:5:41,26 --> 0:5:41,51
ALEX LEBARON: Yes.


154
0:5:41,51 --> 0:5:42,92
SHANE SMITH: --are coming
from America.


155
0:5:42,92 --> 0:5:43,65
ALEX LEBARON: Absolutely.


156
0:5:43,65 --> 0:5:45,11
SHANE SMITH: And the money
is coming from America.


157
0:5:45,11 --> 0:5:45,91
BRENT LEBARON: Absolutely.


158
0:5:45,91 --> 0:5:48,99
I think the Americans need to
really understand that any


159
0:5:48,99 --> 0:5:51,69
policies that are implemented
in the United States impact


160
0:5:51,69 --> 0:5:52,94
our country.


161
0:5:52,94 --> 0:5:54,92



162
0:5:54,92 --> 0:5:56,67
SHANE SMITH: So the money
for all these guns


163
0:5:56,67 --> 0:5:57,93
is coming from America.


164
0:5:57,93 --> 0:6:0,4
The guns themselves
come from America.


165
0:6:0,4 --> 0:6:4,18
The coke is being sold in
America, but the war is being


166
0:6:4,18 --> 0:6:5,55
fought in Mexico.


167
0:6:5,55 --> 0:6:9,0
And considering 1,300 people
were killed in the region just


168
0:6:9,0 --> 0:6:12,66
this past August alone, in
northern Mexico self defense


169
0:6:12,66 --> 0:6:15,459
has truly become a matter
of life and death.


170
0:6:15,459 --> 0:6:20,35



171
0:6:20,35 --> 0:6:22,76
One of the things that we were
worried about was people


172
0:6:22,76 --> 0:6:26,504
knowing that we were here.


173
0:6:26,504 --> 0:6:29,79
They've just announced to the
whole town that we're here


174
0:6:29,79 --> 0:6:32,1
shooting, in a town where they
used to have three or four


175
0:6:32,1 --> 0:6:33,39
kidnappings a week.


176
0:6:33,39 --> 0:6:34,64
I'm going to get drunk.


177
0:6:34,64 --> 0:8:34,64
