###24 JASON: Right now there are more people on Facebook
###28 than there were on the planet 200 years ago.
###35 Humanity's greatest desire is to belong and connect.
###40 And now we see each other.
###43 We hear each other.
###44 -WOMAN: Grandpa, I love you. -I love you.
###47 Why -- Why won't it take a picture?
###49 We share what we love,
###51 and it reminds us what we all have in common.
###53 WOMAN: Dug out alive and well after 7 1/2 days.
###58 If you believe in yourself, you will know how to ride a bike!
###62 Rock and roll!
###64 So, now, technically, your device is on.
###66 [ Laughs ]
###67 Can you tell?
###70 Oh, that's exciting.
###73 JASON: And this connection is changing the way the world works.
###78 Governments are trying to keep up.
###80 Now we can taste the freedom.
###81 [ Indistinct chanting ]
###83 And older generations are concerned.
###85 GIGOT: Many people are very concerned about tomorrow
###88 they could get worse next year.
###90 JASON: The game has new rules.
###94 The next 27 minutes are an experiment.
###99 But in order for it to work, you have to pay attention.
###114 [ Monitor beeping ]
###127 NURSE: Oh, he's cute. He's really cute.
###132 -Wow! -DOCTOR: Congratulations!
###134 I can hear him.
###136 [ Crying ]
###138 JASON: Every single person in the world started this way.
###143 He didn't choose where or when he was born.
###147 But because he's here, he matters.
###150 JASON: Yeah.
###151 We've been waiting for you.
###154 You made it.
###156 My name is Jason Russell, and this is my son, Gavin.
###161 [ Slides clicking ]
###167 He loves jumping on the trampoline,
###169 being a ninja,
###171 and dancing.
###174 What are you doing?
###176 Making a snow angel.
###177 -How do you do that? -You do this.
###179 ♪ Dee-dee-dee, dee-dee-dee, dee-dee-dee-dee-dee ♪
###181 And just like his dad, he likes being in movies...
###185 Action.
###186 Look out! Look out, people!
###188 Run! It's a bomb!
###195 JASON: ...and making movies.
###196 Daddy, watch this.
###200 I think we got the video.
###204 But he was born into a pretty complicated world.
###208 And as a dad, I want him to grow up in a better world than I did.
###213 And because of the course of events in my life,
###216 I see a way to get there.
###218 It has become my job.
###220 Who are you to end a war?
###222 I'm here to tell you: who are you not to?
###226 JASON: Hey, Gavin. What's up?
###227 Years before Gavin was born,
###229 the course of my life was changed entirely by another boy.
###233 And who's this right here?
###235 GAVIN: Jacob.
###237 Who's Jacob?
###238 Jacob is our friend in Africa.
###242 It's been almost 10 years since Jacob and I became friends.
###250 [ Laughter ]
###251 It's okay. They're nice 'cause they're different than sharks.
###257 But when my friends and I first met him
###259 in Uganda in Central Africa,
###262 it was in very different circumstances.
###266 He was running for his life.
###273 -MAN: You go to school here? -Yes.
###275 Yes. That's how you know English so well.
###277 -I know. -Yeah.
###278 Hello.
###279 How many nights have you stayed here?
###282 You are making our work very difficult.
###284 You stop that thing now.
###286 The night I first met Jacob,
###288 he told me what he and other children
###290 in northern Uganda were living through.
###293 We worry the rebels when they arrest us again,
###297 then they will kill us.
###300 My brother tried to escape.
###304 Then they killed him using a panga.
###306 They cut his neck.
###308 Did you see it?
###309 I saw.
###312 We fear that if we sleep at our home,
###314 we can be abducted by the rebels
###318 because our home is far away from town.
###321 They will catch us, then they will take us there in the bush.
###325 We come here to save our life.
###346 I cannot believe that.
###347 This is absurd.
###348 You cannot believe it?
###350 This has been going on for years?
###353 If that happened one night in America,
###355 it would be on the cover of Newsweek.
###360 What is it that you want to be when you grow up?
###364 For me, I wanted to be a lawyer,
###366 but... no money.
###368 I don't have money to pay my school fees
###370 so that I learn and then become a lawyer.
###374 Hmm.
###376 After spending a few weeks with Jacob,
###378 he told me something I would never forget.
###381 It is better when you kill us.
###383 And, if possible, you can kill us, you kill us.
###387 For us, we don't want now to stay.
###389 You don't want to stay on earth?
###391 We are only two. No one is taking care of us.
###394 We are not going to school, so --
###395 You would rather die than stay on earth?
###398 Yes.
###399 Now, even now?
###400 Even now.
###402 How are we going to stay in our future?
###407 He told me more about his brother
###409 and what he would say to him if he were still alive.
###412 I love you, but now I miss you.
###415 So it is better when we meet ---
###419 We are not going to meet, but we may meet in heaven. You see?
###424 So it is better -- I will not talk much.
###425 It will start something
###427 because if I saw my brother once again, I don't...
###431 JASON: Hmm?
###433 [ Sobbing ]
###441 It's okay.
###442 Jacob, it's okay.
###449 Everything in my heart told me to do something.
###453 And so I made him a promise.
###456 We are also going to do everything that we can to stop them.
###462 Yes.
###462 -Do you hear my words? -Yes.
###465 -You know what I mean? -Yes.
###466 Hmm?
###467 Yes.
###468 We are. We're going to stop them.
###474 We're going to stop them.
###478 I made that promise to Jacob not knowing what it would mean.
###483 But now I do.
###485 Over the past nine years, I have fought to fulfill it,
###490 and the fight has led me here, to this movie you're watching,
###494 because that promise is not just about Jacob or me.
###499 It's also about you.
###501 And this year, 2012, is the year that we can finally fulfill it.
###507 And if we succeed, we change the course of human history.
###513 But time is running out.
###514 To level with you, this movie expires on December 31, 2012,
###520 and its only purpose is to stop the rebel group the LRA
###524 and their leader, Joseph Kony.
###526 And I'm about to tell you exactly how we're going to do it.
###529 [ Up-tempo music plays ]
###544 So, the thing is, my son, Gavin, has never --
###547 I've never really explained to him what I do.
###550 He knows I work in Africa,
###552 but he doesn't know what the war's about or who Joseph Kony is,
###557 so I'm gonna explain it to him for the first time today.
###560 That's what we're doing.
###561 -JASON: So, Gav. -Yeah.
###563 -Are you ready? -Yeah.
###564 -I'm gonna ask you some questions. -Okay.
###565 And you can just look at me and answer the questions to me.
###569 I'm kind of nervous.
###572 What do I do for a job?
###574 You stop the bad guys from being mean.
###577 Who are the bad guys?
###579 Um...
###582 -Do you know where they --? -"Star Wars" people.
###584 -"Star Wars" people? -Yeah.
###585 -Those are the bad guys? -Yeah.
###587 -Can I tell you the bad guy's name? -Yeah.
###591 JASON: This is the -- This is the guy, Joseph Kony.
###595 He's the bad guy?
###596 Yeah.
###598 -Who's this? -Jacob.
###601 Joseph Kony -- He has an army, okay?
###606 And what he does is he takes children from their parents
###610 and he gives them a gun to shoot
###613 and he makes them shoot and kill other people.
###618 But they're not gonna do what he says
###621 because they're nice guys, right?
###624 Yeah, they don't want to do what he says,
###626 but he forces them to do bad things.
###631 What do you think about that?
###632 -It's sad. -Mm.
###637 JASON: I couldn't explain to Gavin
###638 the details of what Joseph Kony really does.
###643 Because the truth is, Kony abducts kids just like Gavin.
###655 For 26 years, Kony has been kidnapping children
###659 into his rebel group, the LRA...
###666 ...turning the girls into sex slaves...
###672 ...and the boys into child soldiers.
###676 He makes them mutilate people's faces.
###682 And he forces them to kill their own parents.
###688 And this is not just a few children.
###695 It's been over 30,000 of them.
###701 And Jacob was one of those children.
###710 As if Kony's crimes aren't bad enough,
###713 he is not fighting for any cause, but only to maintain his power.
###718 He is not supported by anyone,
###721 and he has repeatedly used peace talks
###723 to rearm and murder again and again.
###727 Kony different times proposed peace,
###730 and then just regained strength and attacked.
###733 This is the Head Prosecutor
###735 for the International Criminal Court.
###738 In 2002, when the court was started,
###740 their job was to find and demand the arrest
###743 of the world's worst criminals.
###746 Although there are a lot of warlords, murderers,
###749 and dictators in the world,
###751 the perversity of Kony's crimes made him first on the Court's list.
###756 Kony is the first guy indicted by the ICC.
###759 The crimes basically are crimes against humanity
###761 and war crimes committed against the civilian population
###764 including murder, sexual slavery, rapes, abductions.
###769 We need to plan how to arrest Kony.
###772 Start to plan,
###773 and it has to be serious.
###775 In fact, the only way to stop Kony is to show him,
###777 "Hey, we're going to arrest you."
###781 What do you think we should do about him?
###784 We should stop him.
###787 The criminal here is Kony.
###788 Stop him and then solve other problems.
###791 We should stop who?
###792 Him.
###796 JASON: It's obvious that Kony should be stopped.
###799 The problem is, 99% of the planet doesn't know who he is.
###803 If they knew, Kony would have been stopped long ago.
###808 Let the world, let the international community
###811 take justice to him there, follow him wherever he is.
###814 First, to rescue our children, and secondly, to deliver the justice.
###818 We are determined to cooperate with any friend of Uganda
###823 to ensure that this mindless killing and slaughter is ended.
###828 When my friends and I came home from Uganda,
###830 we thought that if the government knew,
###832 they would do something to stop him.
###835 But everyone in Washington we talked to
###837 said there is no way the United States
###840 will ever get involved in a conflict where our national security
###844 or financial interests aren't at stake.
###847 No administration -- Republican, Democrat,
###849 Obama, Bush, Clinton, doesn't matter --
###851 would do enough
###853 because it's simply not an important-enough issue
###855 on the radar screen of American foreign policy.
###859 JASON: Since the government said it was impossible,
###862 we didn't know what else to do
###864 but tell everyone we could
###865 about Jacob and the invisible children.
###869 Let's show this movie to as many people as possible
###871 in such a way that we can't be ignored.
###873 And when we did, people were shocked,
###876 and their awareness turned into action.
###880 We started something -- a community.
###884 I have friends that have been living in this conflict their entire life.
###888 Fight for that, because that is what is gonna change this world,
###891 and that is what defines us.
###893 JASON: We got creative, and we got loud.
###896 ALL: It's not over! It's not over! It's not over!
###901 JASON: And as the LRA began to move into other countries,
###904 Jacob and other Ugandans came to the U.S.
###907 to speak on behalf of all people suffering because of Kony.
###912 Even though Uganda was relatively safe,
###915 they felt compelled to tell the world that Kony was still out there
###918 and had to be stopped.
###921 I'm here so proud advocating for the people who are back at home,
###924 and this change we are going to make is going to last forever.
###927 We built a community around the idea
###930 that where you live shouldn't determine whether you live.
###934 We were committed to stop Kony and rebuild what he had destroyed.
###938 And because we couldn't wait for institutions
###940 or governments to step in,
###942 we did it ourselves
###944 with our time, talent, and money.
###948 So we rebuilt schools.
###951 The best you can offer a child is by letting them be independent,
###956 and that was providing education.
###957 We created jobs.
###960 I have seen the lives of those who have been hopeless,
###964 now they have hope.
###966 And we built an early warning radio network
###969 on the front line of the war
###971 to protect villages from rebel attacks.
###974 To update real time what's happening on a war zone
###977 8,000 miles away.
###981 JASON: All of this was funded by an army of young people
###985 who put their money toward their belief
###986 in the value of all human life.
###989 They gave a few dollars a month of what little they had
###993 to a program called TRI
###995 and proved that a bunch of littles could make a big difference.
###1000 And as a result, the unseen became visible.
###1005 We've seen these kids.
###1009 We've heard their cries.
###1012 This war must end.
###1016 We will not stop.
###1020 We will not fear.
###1023 We will fight war.
###1046 DELIVER YOUR VOICE
###1048 I've talked to people from Mexico, from Canada,
###1050 from every other state that I can think of.
###1051 We're all doing this for the exact same reason,
###1053 and we're all coming from completely different places.
###1056 This is what the world should be like.
###1064 JASON: So, with hundreds of thousands of people with us,
###1067 we went back to Washington, D.C.,
###1069 and we met with congressmen and senators one by one
###1073 on both sides -- Republicans, Democrats --
###1076 and they all agreed with us.
###1078 Joseph Kony's crimes had to be stopped.
###1081 With all the problems that are out there,
###1083 none is more severe than one that -- that mutilates
###1086 and takes the lives of little kids.
###1089 These young members of the Invisible Children Organization
###1092 know that no child should live in fear of being abducted or killed.
###1097 MCGOVERN: So they were determined to become their voice.
###1099 They realized that these African children and families
###1103 were invisible to Washington policymakers.
###1105 So they decided to make them visible.
###1108 JASON: And what I was told would never happen
###1111 suddenly became possible.
###1113 "In furtherance of the Congress's stated policy,
###1116 I have authorized a small number of U.S. forces
###1119 to deploy to Central Africa
###1121 to provide assistance to regional forces
###1123 that are working toward the removal of Joseph Kony from the battlefield.
###1127 Sincerely, Barack Obama."
###1131 [ Cheers and applause ]
###1134 The surprise announcement came in a letter from the White House.
###1136 The U.S. President's decision commits U.S. troops to help.
###1139 Through advice and assistance --
###1141 not putting Americans into combat --
###1143 to help the countries of the region end this threat once and for all.
###1146 And that was a worthwhile investment.
###1148 [ Cheers and applause ]
###1152 We used to think we could not do it, and now when I see we can do it,
###1156 I am overwhelmed.
###1158 [ Ululating ]
###1160 JASON: After eight years of work, the government finally heard us.
###1164 And in October of 2011,
###1167 a hundred American advisers were sent into Central Africa
###1170 to assist the Ugandan army in arresting Kony
###1174 and stopping the LRA.
###1176 It was the first time in history
###1178 that the United States took that kind of action
###1180 because the people demanded it.
###1184 Not for self-defense, but because it was right.
###1195 HIGH FREQUENCY REPORT FROM CENTRAL AFRICA
###1198 DATE: 2 DECEMBER, 2011
###1200 A 14-year-old boy who just escaped
###1204 reports that "Joseph Kony now knows
###1207 of the United States' plan to stop the LRA,
###1210 and he is going to change his tactics to avoid capture
###1214 now that the great power is after him."
###1218 We've come so far. But Kony is still out there.
###1224 He's recently changed his tactics,
###1227 making it even more difficult to capture him.
###1230 And international support could be removed at any time.
###1236 If we take the pressure off, if we're not successful,
###1239 he is going to be growing his numbers.
###1243 People forget, and you've got to remind them,
###1245 and it takes numbers to remind them.
###1247 And if interest wanes, then it'll just -- it'll go away,
###1251 and I'd end up standing out there alone
###1253 trying to do something to support completing the mission.
###1257 It's got to be 2012.
###1259 It's not bad for the youth, it's bad for the world if we fail.
###1263 It's not important just for Ugandan people,
###1265 it's important for everyone.
###1269 It's hard to look back on some parts of human history.
###1274 Because when we heard about injustice,
###1277 we cared, but we didn't know what to do.
###1281 Too often we did nothing.
###1285 But if we're going to change that, we have to start somewhere,
###1290 so we're starting here, with Joseph Kony
###1294 because now we know what to do.
###1297 Here it is. Ready?
###1300 In order for Kony to be arrested this year,
###1303 the Ugandan military has to find him.
###1307 In order to find him,
###1309 they need the technology and training to track him in the vast jungle.
###1314 That's where the American advisers come in.
###1317 But in order for the American advisers to be there,
###1320 the U.S. government has to deploy them.
###1322 They've done that, but if the government doesn't believe
###1325 that people care about arresting Kony,
###1328 the mission will be canceled.
###1330 In order for the people to care, they have to know.
###1334 And they will only know if Kony's name is everywhere.
###1342 KONY CAPTURED
###1343 This is the dream.
###1344 Kony arrested for all the world to see,
###1348 and the abducted children returned home.
###1353 -JASON: Here's the biggest problem. -Yeah.
###1355 -Do you want to know what it is? -Yeah.
###1357 Nobody knows who he is.
###1360 Nobody knows, but -- but I know who he is
###1364 because I see him on this picture right now.
###1369 He's not famous.
###1370 He's invisible. Joseph Kony's invisible.
###1374 JASON: Here is how we're going to make him visible.
###1377 MAKE HIM FAMOUS
###1379 We are going to make Joseph Kony a household name
###1382 not to celebrate him, but to bring his crimes to the light.
###1386 And we are starting this year, 2012.
###1390 We are targeting 20 culture makers
###1392 and 12 policymakers
###1394 to use their power for good.
###1396 Let's start with the 20 culture makers.
###1399 Celebrities, athletes, and billionaires have a loud voice,
###1403 and what they talk about spreads instantly.
###1406 I want...
###1407 I'd like indicted war criminals
###1410 to enjoy the same level of celebrity as me.
###1413 That seems fair.
###1414 That's our objective, is to just shine a light on it.
###1417 If our goal is to get Kony's name known,
###1420 the known should join us.
###1422 We are targeting 20 of the most diverse
###1425 and influential culture makers
###1426 to speak out about Kony and make him famous.
###1430 -Oprah. -Mark Zuckerberg.
###1432 -Ryan Seacrest. -WOMAN: Bono.
###1433 JASON: Then we're going after policymakers --
###1435 the ones that have the authority to see Kony captured.
###1439 They decide if the advisers stay or leave.
###1442 So we need to remind them that in this election year
###1445 of fighting and name-calling,
###1447 no matter what side you're on,
###1449 this is something we can all agree on.
###1452 If a senator or congressman notices 25 phone calls
###1455 on any issue on any given day, it is noted.
###1458 When citizens by the hundreds of thousands
###1462 start demanding that our government do something,
###1464 suddenly it becomes in the national interest
###1467 of the United States government to respond to this problem.
###1470 JASON: We've identified the 12 policymakers
###1473 that could change the game regarding Kony,
###1475 so we're targeting them.
###1477 On our website, we've made it easy to write them directly,
###1480 call them, meet with them, and get their attention.
###1484 If my son were kidnapped and forced to kill,
###1486 it would be all over the news.
###1488 So we are making Kony world news
###1491 by redefining the propaganda we see all day, every day
###1496 that dictates who and what we pay attention to.
###1499 A lot of people feel powerless to communicate their ideas.
###1501 They think that, "Okay, you know, I'm not a corporation.
###1504 I don't own my own magazine or news station.
###1507 I just don't have any say."
###1509 But seeing what I've done,
###1510 I think it's empowered a lot of people to realize
###1512 that one individual can make an impact.
###1514 And I actually want to demystify and say,
###1516 "Here are these really simple tools. Go out and rock it."
###1520 JASON: And that's just what we intend to do.
###1522 ♪ I can't stop ♪
###1527 JASON: Our goal is to change the conversation of our culture
###1530 and get people to ask, "Who is Joseph Kony?"
###1533 We have printed hundreds of thousands of posters,
###1536 stickers, yard signs, and fliers
###1538 that are right now, today,
###1540 being put up in major cities all over the world.
###1544 We have thousands of "Kony 2012" bracelets
###1547 that we want everyone to wear this year only.
###1551 Each bracelet has a unique I.D. number.
###1553 Input that number and you enter the mission to make Kony famous.
###1558 You can geotag your posters and track your impact in real time.
###1562 Everything you need is in a box called the Action Kit.
###1566 It has two bracelets -- one for you and one to give away.
###1570 And if you want to help fund our lifesaving programs,
###1572 donate a few dollars a month through TRI
###1576 and you can have the Action Kit for free.
###1578 Start making Kony famous today,
###1580 but all of these efforts will culminate on one day --
###1584 April 20th -- when we cover the night.
###1587 This is the day when we will meet at sundown
###1590 and blanket every street in every city till the sun comes up.
###1594 We will be smart, and we will be thorough.
###1597 The rest of the world will go to bed Friday night
###1600 and wake up to hundreds of thousands of posters
###1602 demanding justice on every corner.

###1624 JASON: It's always been that the decisions made by the few
###1628 with the money and the power
###1630 dictated the priorities of their government
###1633 and the stories in the media.
###1635 They determine the lives and the opportunities of their citizens.
###1640 But now there is something bigger than that.
###1643 The people of the world see each other
###1646 and can protect each other.
###1649 It's turning the system upside down, and it changes everything.
###1655 We are living in a new world, Facebook World,
###1658 in which 750 million people share ideas,
###1662 not thinking in borders.
###1664 It's a global community, bigger than the U.S.
###1666 Joseph Kony was committing crimes for twenty years, and no one cared.
###1671 We care.
###1674 We have reached a crucial time in history
###1677 where what we do or don't do right now
###1681 will affect every generation to come.
###1684 Arresting Joseph Kony will prove
###1687 that the world we live in has new rules,
###1689 that the technology that has brought our planet together
###1693 is allowing us to respond to the problems of our friends.
###1697 When it ends, finally, by bringing Kony to justice,
###1700 it should be celebrated worldwide.
###1703 We are not just studying human history.
###1706 We are shaping it.
###1709 At the end of my life,
###1711 I want to say that the world we've left behind
###1714 is one that Gavin can be proud of,
###1717 a place that doesn't allow Joseph Konys and child soldiers,
###1721 a place where children, no matter where they live,
###1725 have a childhood free from fear.
###1728 -I'm gonna be like you, Dad. -JASON: When you grow up?
###1731 -Yeah. -Are you sure?
###1733 I'm gonna come with you to Africa.
###1737 JASON: The better world we want is coming.
###1741 It's just waiting for us to stop at nothing.
