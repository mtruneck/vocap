###14 For a while now, Audi has owned the fast estate
###17 marketplace.
###18 Yes, Merc sold the odd E55 wagon, and BMW occasionally
###22 lobbed us an M5 Touring, but they never sold the way RS4's
###27 and RS6's sold.
###29 In many ways, the success of the RS6 perfectly describes
###32 the dichotomy between a road test assessment of a car and
###35 what people actually want to live with.
###38 In the magazine test, four-wheel drive means stars
###41 deducted for understeer.
###42 In the real world, it means safety and
###44 traction in the wet.
###46 Turbocharging means a hammering for poor throttle
###48 response from your average journalist--
###50 that's me--
###51 but massive power gains for the owner, if
###53 they bend the rules.
###55 Objectively, the last RS6 was blunt, effective, very fast,
###59 and not really enjoyable.
###61 But the people who owned them loved them.
###65 Audi reckons the new one is quite different, that it
###67 actually handles.
###69 It will need to be to beat this lump of Stuttgart heavy
###72 artillery, the Mercedes CLS63 AMG Shooting Brake.
###76 Why not an E class, you cry?
###78 Because this is just as big as the RS6 inside, and it looks
###82 bloody wonderful.
###83 
###86 Oh, Audi, Audi, Audi, you do confuse me so.
###92 I've always thought the RS6 was the car that I shouldn't
###95 buy from you.
###97 It was just a bit too big, a bit too heavy.
###99 Yes, it could pulverize stuff in a straight line.
###101 And if you gave it to the right man, he could extract a
###103 million horsepower from it.
###105 But to drive, it was always a bit nothing.
###108 In fact, it was the worst car you made.
###110 Why, then, is the new RS6 one of the best cars you make?
###115 For starters, it handles.
###118 This car is not on air suspension.
###120 I was led to believe that the RS6 had to be on air
###122 suspension to work.
###123 But this is on the normal springs with the fancy,
###125 adjustable dampers.
###126 And in comfort, it's lovely.
###129 It's a really, really supple car.
###131 It's got wheel travel.
###132 It rolls a bit.
###133 It's just pleasant to be in.
###135 Not once have I cursed any kind of harshness in this car.
###139 For its intended role, going flat out and fast on motorways
###143 and demolishing A roads, it's brilliant.
###145 Ignore the dynamic mode.
###147 If I put it in dynamic mode now, the camera would fall off
###150 the windscreen.
###150 It's that bad.
###152 Ignore the heavy, sporty steering setting as well.
###156 What you want to do is put the whole thing in comfort, long
###158 throttle, nice and slow, and make sure that you've got the
###161 dampers in soft.
###163 Then you're just happy, really.
###164 You could make the engine a bit noisy if you want to, but
###167 that's kind of showing off, isn't it.
###170 What else do I like about this car?
###172 The powertrain--
###174 twin turbo V8s with this ZF 8-speed gearbox are always
###178 going to be a bit handy.
###179 But this is just borderline genius.
###182 It is lacking some personality, though.
###184 It's quite quiet.
###185 It seems that things have been ramped back a bit with this
###188 generation of Audis.
###189 At times, you're not even aware that it's a V8.
###191 It starts up with a nice "woofle" as
###193 you probably heard.
###194 But otherwise, it can be mute.
###196 Under full load, it's got a sort of hot, planey, V8, hard
###201 blare noise, which is good fun, but nothing that special.
###205 Now I just like the package.
###207 I love the way it looks.
###208 I think it's brutal from the front end.
###211 It's got so much presence.
###213 I like the cabin.
###214 I don't find it as intuitive as the Mercedes.
###216 But it's still a great place to sit,
###218 and it feels so special.
###219 The seats are superb, supportive, comfortable.
###222 It's roomy.
###223 Not quite as big as the Mercedes, strangely, but
###226 still, it's practical.
###228 It's just so many things to so many potential buyers, if they
###233 have the money.
###234 70-liter fuel tank-- that's a bit mean in my book.
###237 It could be a little bit bigger.
###239 And fuel economy is not brilliant.
###242 On a fast run, I'm doing 17 to the gallon.
###245 On a quickish run-- and let's face it, you're never going to
###248 travel anything less than quickish in this car--
###251 it's about 19 to 20, whereas the Merc can
###254 stretch it up to 25.
###255 But do you buy one of these things for fuel economy?
###259 No, you probably don't.
###262 The RS6 is a great, fast Audi.
###267 It is--
###268 leaving the R8 to one side for a minute--
###270 the best car that Audi RS makes.
###273 It's miles better than the new RS4 And don't believe anyone
###277 who says otherwise.
###280 The new RS6 ditches the old V10 motor and uses a 4-liter
###283 twin turbo V8 to give 560 horsepower and 516
###288 foot-pounds.
###288 At a cruise, it can deactivate four of those cylinders, too.
###292 Claimed curb weight is just over 2 tons, which is lighter
###294 than before.
###296 It also uses ZF's amazing 8-speed auto.
###298 And this car is fitted with the dynamic pack, which gives
###300 steel springs and adjustable dampers, and raises the top
###303 speed to 174 miles an hour.
###307 Now let's face it, no one does hard-as-nails wagon styling
###311 like Audi--
###312 flared arches, massive, optional 21-inch rims,
###315 satin-finished aluminum, and "quattro" stamped on the front
###318 grill to scare the 911 in front of you.
###321 Yes, you pay extra for that, too.
###324 The base price of the RS6 is 75,500 pounds.
###327 But even with a light smattering of extras, this
###329 test car cost 90,565 quid--
###333 for an estate car.
###335 You do get the fancy sport
###336 rear-differential for free, though.
###338 So that's all right.
###339 
###344 I make no secret of the fact that I'm living with this CLS
###347 for a year.
###348 It's not my car, but I use it every single day.
###351 So I'm more connected to it.
###353 I obviously find its controls a bit more user friendly.
###356 I find everything a bit easier.
###358 But even if I didn't live with it every day, I'd think the
###360 cabin was more logical than the one in the Audi.
###364 The dynamics of these cars are very interesting.
###368 They really are very similar on paper.
###369 Quite how Audi managed to squeeze so much torque from a
###372 4-liter twin-turbo motor, whereas Mercedes needs 5.5
###375 liters to go a little bit further, I don't know.
###378 I suspect that this engine could go quite a bit further
###381 if they wanted it to.
###382 On the road?
###383 Well, in terms of torque, this has more of it, and feels
###386 gruntier low down.
###387 But I'll cut to the chase.
###389 The difference between the two cars is in the transmission.
###393 Whereas the Mercedes feels it has to wait a little bit
###395 longer to find the next gear, or drop one, or go up one, and
###398 find where the torque is, the Audi just goes.
###402 The Audi just flies.
###403 It's insane.
###404 It feels faster on the road.
###406 And this car already, to me, feels loopy fast.
###411 But the Merc has the upper hand in several
###412 areas on the road.
###413 It feels much more agile.
###415 The steering's got a lot more life to it.
###417 In fact, the whole powertrain has.
###418 If you like music, this makes it.
###420 Whereas the Audi in the debate, this thing just sounds
###423 like a muscle car.
###424 It's a monster.
###425 When you start it up, you just giggle.
###427 When you leave it in stop-start mode, well, that's
###429 fantastic, because it keeps restarting.
###431 And you get that incredible ra-ra-ra-ra noise
###434 when it gets going.
###436 I love driving it.
###437 It has its limitations, though, because
###439 it's two-wheel drive.
###442 This is probably the core problem for people who buy
###445 cars like this.
###446 Do you go for the crazy [INAUDIBLE] two-wheel drive
###448 Mercedes, and do sideways everywhere?
###450 Not really applicable in normal driving.
###453 Or do you get the Audi, which is going to be just as quick,
###455 come rain or shine?
###457 It rained for one day when we had these two cars.
###459 And frankly, the Mercedes couldn't see where
###462 the Audi had gone.
###463 But the person driving the Mercedes was smiling more.
###466 Now, I could use that argument to, perhaps, create a
###470 situation where a sports car might be better because it was
###473 two-wheel drive rather than four-wheel drive.
###475 But in the world of super estate cars, I
###478 struggle with that.
###479 I struggle.
###480 I know Mercedes are bringing four-wheel
###481 drive cars on stream.
###482 But at the moment, I can only judge what we've got.
###487 I do love driving this thing, though.
###489 And it is more direct.
###490 It has better steering.
###491 It has better brake feel.
###493 Everything about it feels that little bit tighter.
###497 But it doesn't have the transmission or that kind of
###500 eye-opening performance that you get from the Audi.
###502 A little bit further ride, when I've got it in comfort,
###505 than the Audi.
###505 But there's two extra damper settings here.
###508 And frankly, they're better judged than the Audi extra
###511 damping settings.
###511 But for me, I never drive this car in
###513 anything other than comfort.
###515 
###520 The base price of the Shooting Brake is even higher--
###522 over 83 grand.
###524 And this one lists at over 97,000.
###527 There's no power kit option on this AMG.
###529 You get your 557 horsepower and 590 foot-pounds for free.
###534 But the locking rear differential, it's 2 and 1/2
###537 grand-- for a diff.
###539 But you know what?
###539 The CLS feels way more expensive inside.
###542 Everything is covered in soft, waxy, expensive smelling
###545 leather, where the Audi has dark plastics.
###547 You can't ignore the RS6's gorgeous
###549 quilted seats, though.
###551 And I love the way the dials greet you on a dark morning.
###554 The AMG counters with lighting you can change
###557 according to your mood.
###560 These are both cabins you'd happily spend whole days
###562 roaming about a continent in.
###564 Big, comfortable, spacious, they are all the car you
###567 should ever need.
###568 They're not about raw speed, are they?
###572 Well, they kind of are now, these are super estates,
###574 aren't they?
###575 So we need to drag race them.
###577 Here, we have over 1,100 horsepower, space for 10
###580 adults and four Labradors.
###583 What happens next is a little eye-opening.
###586 The Audi, quite understandably, beats the Merc
###588 off the line, because it has four driven wheels.
###590 But the margin, on paper, isn't as bad as you'd think.
###593 Just remember that the car being left behind here hits 60
###596 miles an hour in 4.2 seconds.
###599 The Audi does it in a scarcely believable 3.9 seconds.
###603 Just imagine what the transmission is going through
###606 to make a two-ton, four-wheel drive estate do 60 in 3.9
###611 But this is the bit that blows my mind.
###613 The Audi keeps pulling away.
###615 From 60 to 100 miles an hour, it pulls another
###618 4/10 from the Merc.
###619 There's no traction advantage now.
###621 It's nearly 70 foot-pounds down on torque,
###623 and it weighs more.
###625 And you can thank the
###626 transmission for the dominance.
###628 The shifts are miles faster.
###630 The extra ratio means even better use
###632 of the power available.
###633 And the RS6 beats the AMG hands down.
###637 Only when they get above 100 does the CLS hold station.
###640 But by that time, the Audi is gone.

###656 
###664 I really don't understand Audi RS as a company.
###668 Their work is so variable.
###670 Last year, I had the disappointment of the RS4.
###674 Now I kind of have the ecstasy of this RS6 unit which I think
###678 is a fantastic motor car.
###681 Objectively, it's better than my beloved CLS.
###685 It puts its power on the road better.
###687 It's nearly as much fun to drive.
###690 And its gearbox is the telling component.
###692 That ZF 8-speed is a genius transmission.
###695 And it really shows up the old seven speeder in the Merc now.
###699 It also looks fantastic.
###700 It's great to be in.
###701 And on these steel springs and with these special dampers, in
###707 comfort mode, it's nice to drive on the road in the UK as
###709 well, unexpectedly so.
###711 The RS4 used to be the choice of the fast Audi estates for
###715 the person that enjoys driving.
###716 I think this car completely reverses that.
###719 So where does that leave the lovely CLS Shooting Brake?
###723 It's a car of immense character, I think more
###725 character than this vehicle.
###727 It's like a muscle car, but with art deco overtones.
###731 I love the style.
###732 I love the way it dries.
###733 It has a nicer steering.
###735 Many things about it are preferable.
###737 But objectively, this Audi's the better car.
