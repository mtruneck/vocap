###2 The *second* bravest person who ever lived was the first person to try a raw oyster.
###8 The bravest person was the first one to consent to being circumcised. Today, some people routinely
###14 eat oysters, and up to 30% of the world's male population have a part of their penis
###20 removed shortly after birth. The statistics for Americans are around 70%, or as high as
###27 80% among European-Americans, and the rates vary with religion and region. By contrast,
###34 the European rates are much lower, less than 20%, less than 1% in places like Finland,
###41 and in Muslim controlled central Asia and the Mid-East, the rates are nearly 100%.
###47 The faiths of Islam, Christianity and Judaism practice circumcision as a religious rite,
###53 an obligation of faith, and some African tribes practice adult circumcision as part of the
###59 rites of manhood. The earliest record of circumcision comes from ancient Egyptian art, and the Semitic
###65 peoples appear to have adopted the practice long before the writing of scriptures, suggesting
###71 that wide-spread circumcision pre-dated the Bible by thousands of years. Alexander the
###77 Great, a Greek Macedonian who was raised in a non-circumcision culture, was said to have
###82 radically altered the traditional circumcision practice of the peoples he conquered.
###87 What an odd thing for diverse cultures to have adopted. I suppose certain early cultures
###94 might have associated foreskin with poor hygenic practices. In some cultures, circumcision
###100 of young boys was probably a sort of coming-out party for the genitals, a test of manhood
###106 as well. Some tribal cultures consider the phallus to be a symbol of fertility or power.
###112 The act of modifying it has an effect on the perception of the person. That cultural interest
###118 probably became codified in cults and religious ceremonies, like ceremonial tatooing or ear
###124 piercing or many other body modifications practiced by world cultures. The genitals
###130 have always been a religious obsession: up to and including full self-castration by male
###137 priests of Cybele. (sib-ellee). So, although we associate circumcision with certain religious
###143 groups, the practice seems to predate the religion, and the cultural practice was co-opted
###149 by priests, rather than invented by them.
###153 I had no idea that male circumcision was such a touchy subject. Growing up as I did in the
###159 American MidWest, circumcision was a normal part of labor and delivery. When my wife and
###165 I were discussing our plans with our obstetrician, we really hadn't discussed the topic together.
###172 In the end, we made a hasty decision to carry on the tradition in my family: circumcision.
###177 Now that I look back, I regret basing such an important medical decision on such casual
###183 thinking or lack thereof. However, I don't think the issue is as clear-cut, pun intended,
###190 as it might appear at first glance. I want to throw out a few issues that I've been thinking
###195 about. I hope you'll watch the full video, tell me your thoughts on the topic, and hopefully
###201 start some useful discussion.
###203 My mind is far from made up on this topic, and I confess the more I learn, the more complex
###209 are the issues and the harder it's been to take a strong stand on either side. Sometimes
###214 knowledge is the enemy of confidence and vice versa.
###219 1. Modern infant circumcision methods are relatively safe and minimize suffering, but
###225 are not RISK-FREE nor painless.
###230 Most circumcisions are done in one of three methods, the Plastibell, Gomco or Mogen clamps.
###235 All of them are relatively very safe, with few recorded complications, but there ARE
###241 complications and risks. Not the least of which is the risk of cosmetic or functional
###247 damage to the penis, minor or serious infection, and bleeding or hemmorage. These risks are
###253 usually lowest in newborns. Older children and adults who undergo the surgery are much
###259 more likely to have serious complications. There've been numerous studies that attempted
###264 to quantify adverse events. If we simply include any symptom, including redness or bleeding,
###271 the rates range from 2 to 40 percent, depending on definitions. If the study only includes
###278 serious complications, which would be issues requiring further medical care, the rates
###283 are usually around 0.2%. That's 2 out of a 1000 circumcisions where the procedure required
###290 additional medical care. Usually these were a matter of bringing the baby back in to the
###296 doctor, or it could include an ER visit. I couldn't find any recorded cases of deaths
###301 in my survey of the medical literature, but I did find an estimate of 1 death for every
###307 500,000 circumcisions suggested by an opponent of circumcision , Lowell King, in a 1975 report.
###315 I suspect that's a bit high, and includes cases where the proximal cause may not have
###320 actually been the circumcision. Nevertheless, there are risks, up to and including death,
###327 though they are very rare.
###328 2. There are some medical benefits to routine infant circumcision.
###336 In some cases, removal of the foreskin is medically necessary to prevent more serious
###342 pathology. We could call that medical circumcision, but I'm talking here specifically about circumcision
###348 of boys as a routine practice.
###351 We can break the topics of benefits into three categories: STD transmission risk, UTI risk
###358 and severity, and avoidance of rare conditions.
###363 Particularly the HIV risk argument must be addressed. Foreskin is a favorite target of
###371 HIV infection. It is loaded with the kinds of cells most easily infected, the Langerhan's
###376 cell, but not protected by a resistant layer of protein called keratin. We would predict,
###382 therefore, that circumcised men without a foreskin would be less likely to be infected.
###389 The process should also affect the ability to transmit the virus, as microscopic openings
###394 in the foreskin allow the virus an easy exit to the next host.
###399 That's the mechanism or theory behind protective circumcision, how does that translate into
###405 actual protection? Well, the evidence seems pretty strongly in favor, although there are
###411 some who disagree. In high risk populations, like those in East and Southern Africa, it's
###418 very protective. We're talking about 60% or more reductions in transmission. That could
###425 save millions of lives, and the public health agencies that operate in the area, like the
###430 World Health Organization, are actively investigating if the benefits outweigh the risks, and if
###436 circumcision clinics for adults are practical. If we had an effective alternative for preventing
###442 the spread of HIV, if condom use and testing were more prevalent, I would say this argument
###448 would be neutralized. However, at the present moment, circumcision is very effective in
###454 these high risk populations. In lower risk populations the HIV risk reduction is more
###461 modest.
###463 The protection doesn't just benefit men, it also benefits women, since the protective
###468 effects are only detectable in heterosexual transmission. By benefitting women, it can
###474 also prevent newborn children from being born infected and that saves the lives of little
###479 baby boys.
###481 Similar effects and similar mechanisms have been identified for several other STDs: genital
###486 ulcers, Herpes, Trichomoniasis and human papillomavirus infection transmission are all reduced in
###493 circumsized individuals. Chlamydia and gonnorhea transmission, on the other hand, don't appear
###499 to be affected.
###501 The papillomavirus infection is especially important, as HPVs are associated with various
###507 cancers, most especially of the cervix, where it's implicated in nearly 100% of cases. Worldwide,
###515 cervical cancer is estimated to affect 490,000 women, and cause 270,000 deaths annually.
###522 Circumcised men are both less likely to be infected, and also less likely to transmit
###528 the infection. This may help to save the lives of women. Vaccines against HPV may change
###535 the cost to benefit equation, but for the moment, I think this is a point in favor of
###539 circumcision.
###543 Circumcision also reduces the risk of penile cancer, although the prevalence of this condition
###548 is so rare that it's hard to put much emphasis on this benefit.
###553 Circumcision reduces the likelihood of a urinary tract infection by eliminating an area where
###558 infections can form and remain hidden. Since newborns have a non-retractable foreskin,
###564 it provides a little pocket where bacteria can lodge and grow. As a result, keeping a
###570 circumcised penis clean and dry appears to be easier, but this could probably be overcome
###576 by a little extra effort on the part of the parents.
###581 What kind of magnitude of benefit is seen in circumcised infant boys? 1% of newborn
###587 boys develop a UTI, and the risk reduction is about 10 fold. That sounds pretty impressive,
###595 but it means that we have to circumcise about 110 boys to prevent one UTI from occurring,
###602 which probably doesn't quite overcome the risk of complications from the procedure.
###608 On the other hand, some little boys have a high risk of UTI due to medical conditions
###613 where urine flows back into the ureter and kidney, and circumcision lowers their risk
###619 enormously. In these cases, benefits clearly outweigh risks, and only four circumcisions
###625 are needed to prevent one UTI. If you've ever had a urinary tract infection, you know that
###632 they are not fun, and can potentially become quite severe.
###636 Lastly, male infant circumcision can be protective against certain rare conditions. Phimosis
###641 is a good example, where the foreskin doesn't become retractible. This is a serious medical
###647 condition, and can require therapeutic circumcision, or it can sometimes be treated with a simple
###653 steroid cream.
###656 There are other such conditions of the foreskin that can be prevented by its removal at a
###660 very young age, although the cost to benefit ratio for these may be questionable.
###666 3. Routine circumcisions are not recommended by most medical authorities
###671 I'm just going to read the position statement of the American Academy of Pediatrics. It
###677 typifies the fairly generic statements that neither condone nor condemn the cultural practice
###683 of circumcision, but don't endorse a purely medical indication for infant circumcision.
###691 "The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) believes that circumcision has potential medical
###695 benefits and advantages, as well as risks. The existing scientific evidence is not sufficient
###701 to recommend routine circumcision. Therefore, because the procedure is not essential to
###707 a child’s current well-being, we recommend that the decision to circumcise is one best
###713 made by parents in consultation with their pediatrician, taking into account what is
###718 in the best interests of the child, including medical, religious, cultural, and ethnic traditions.
###723 "
###725 This is the current position statement, and it reflects the modern consensus. In the past,
###730 the AAP has taken stronger stands against or in favor of circumcision, depending on
###736 current evidence and the political environment. Circumcision has seen a decline in recent
###741 years in the US, and I think the medical community themselves are responsible for the change,
###746 advising parents about both medical and ethical concerns of circumcision.
###752 4. The evidence about the negative health consequences of circumcision is a mixed bag.
###761 One odd thing about being a biologist is that so much is known about the human body that
###766 we have to specialize in one particular topic. In this case, as I read through the list of
###771 adverse events associated with male circumcision, I was painfully reminded of how little I know
###778 about that area of the body, despite EXTENSIVE personal study and examination in my youth.
###786 Male infant circumcision may have some serious associated risks, but it has to be remembered
###792 that 1 in 3 men are circumcised and that the practice goes back into the misty recesses
###797 of pre-history, so the effects must be fairly rare or non-critical. However, the kinds of
###804 complications listed in the literature required that I go back to a medical dictionary. Here
###810 are some of the terms I encountered: lymphedema, urinary fistula, hypospadias, epispadias,
###817 meatus ulceration and glans skin bridges. Catastrophic events like partial or total
###824 loss of the function of the penis occur once in every million or so circumcisions done
###831 under modern surgical conditions.
###832 One primary concern is a loss of sexual pleasure. The tip of the penis is exposed, and over
###840 time the skin might be more likely to become keratinized, or tougher and thicker, and therefore
###846 a little less sensitive, although most studies didn't find this to be the case. There is
###852 also some concern about mutual enjoyment of intercourse, although I didn't find much evidence
###858 for this in the literature, either. In fact, in some studies the opposite is true, with
###863 surveys of female partners in Africa stating that they preferred sex with their partner
###869 after he was circumcised.
###872 There are also some who speculate that the pain and suffering of the procedure, together
###876 with inadequate anaesthesia, has an effect on the child that translates into psychological
###882 damage. There is a definite effect on older children between 2 and 6 who are old enough
###888 to be aware, but too young to understand, called castration anxiety.
###895 All of this represents the purely scientific, purely medical, pros and cons. This ignores
###901 the most deeply controversial topic, the ethics and morality of surgical removal of a natural
###908 part of the human body. Here, science is silent. Is it right for a parent to make such a decision
###916 for a child, one that is permanent and profound, painful and risky? Does the physician honor
###923 their oath to do no harm, if they perform this procedure without a medical indication?
###928 I've thought a very long time on this topic, and I think that my own decision for my son
###934 might not have been justified. I deeply regret that all this consideration comes now, when
###941 the decision is long past. I don't think he was permanently harmed, and I don't think
###946 he'll have any problems in the future, but I wish I had given the topic more thought
###951 at the time.
###953 I am most swayed by the argument about the rights of the infant to make choices about
###957 their own body. I would prefer if the child could make this decision. Unfortunately, the
###963 risk of complications of adult circumcision make it much higher risk compared to infant
###970 circumcision. If the child can't make the decision at the point where the procedure
###974 is safest, I think the parent usually has the best interests of the child at heart,
###979 and any decision they make is part of their legal guardianship. It's not an optimal solution,
###986 but it's one we've practiced in other cases where important medical or legal decisions
###991 need to be made.
###994 I strongly support the use of anaesthetic during the procedure, something that is not
###999 routinely done in the US. Some figures suggest only about 25% of circumcisions are done under
###1005 anaesthesia. Maybe I don't understand the case against, but it seems like preventing
###1010 pain and suffering is the least we can do for the baby boy.
###1016 Lastly, I know the topic of female genital cutting is bound to come up in discussion.
###1021 I don't consider the two procedures to be equal. The closest analog in women to the
###1026 male foreskin is the clitoral hood. This is rarely the only tissue removed, usually the
###1032 clitoris is either partially or entirely removed. This is the equivalent of castration in males,
###1039 something not practiced in modern cultures. I'd like to keep the two issues separated,
###1045 but I think it's only fair to allow for comparisons so long as a proper equivalence is made. I
###1052 am strongly opposed to female genital cutting.
###1057 I'd like to summarize my own impressions from research on this topic. I think the medical
###1062 evidence is slightly in favor of routine circumcision. There are no benefits that cannot be obtained
###1069 in other ways. The most effective way to prevent HIV and other STD transmission is still condom
###1076 use or abstinence. Condom use is the best solution. Proper foreskin hygeine, likewise,
###1083 can greatly reduce UTI rates in young boys without the need for surgical prevention.
###1089 In the very real world, circumcision is an imperfect solution, but one that seems to
###1096 work. It could potentially save millions of lives in high risk areas. The medical benefits
###1103 are offset by medical risks and possible psychological or sexual effects later in life, but I still
###1111 think the evidence is slightly in favor.
###1114 On the other hand, the ethical issues around circumcision are, on the balance, anti-circumcision.
###1122 It seems a violation of the rights of the child to an intact body, and it seems to violate
###1127 core medical ethics to do no harm.
###1131 There is also the religious, cultural, or family tradition to consider. Parents could
###1136 be argued to have certain rights to decide what traditions their children follow until
###1141 their age of maturity. This is not an argument that I find very compelling, so I won't go
###1146 any deeper into it.
###1148 I look forward to a "robust" discussion on this topic. Before you start writing your
###1153 500 character argument, though, I would make three requests. One, try to avoid overly emotional
###1161 wording and tactics. Two, if you make an assertion of fact, a proper citation to a source is
###1168 much appreciated. Note that links are not only not allowed in YouTube comments, but
###1173 they aren't even proper citations. Three, and this is the challenge: I would ask that
###1179 you avoid using any terms that you'd be uncomfortable reading aloud to a nice old lady you met on
###1184 the bus. Good luck, and be creative. Extravagantly fictional prizes will be awarded to the best
###1190 use of creatively non-offensive language.
###1193 I have so many papers to cite that I've had trouble posting them below. Instead, I've
###1198 posted a link to the citations in the under-bar.
###1201 As always, thanks for watching.
