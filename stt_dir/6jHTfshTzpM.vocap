###9 ANGIE SULLIVAN: Hi.
###10 I'm Angie Sullivan.
###11 And this is my friend Rufus.
###13 We're here today in Southport, Connecticut, to meet with
###15 Kendall Crolius and learn all about knitting with dog hair.
###18 Come on, Rufus.
###20 We recently did a piece in "Vice" with photographer Erwin
###23 [INAUDIBLE]
###24 on dog hair garments.
###26 And we're here today to find out how the
###28 whole process is done.
###29 KENDALL CROLUIS: I have been knitting with dog hair for
###33 about 25 years now.
###34 Hey, Rufus.
###36 So this has been a very important part of my life.
###38 I'm Kendall Crolius.
###39 I'm a co-author of "Knitting with Dog Hair." And I'm
###43 delighted to have you here with us today.
###45 I have always loved needlework of all kinds.
###49 Knitting, all of that.
###50 And I'd always wanted to learn how to spin.
###52 I thought that would be a fun thing to know.
###54 And many years ago I was able to take a spinning course at a
###58 local fiber arts store.
###60 And one of the things that the teacher said to us was, by the
###63 way, you don't have to limit yourself to
###65 wool, to sheep wool.
###67 You can spin anything.
###68 You could even spin dog hair.
###70 And I thought, well, that's interesting.
###72 Because we had a golden retriever who shed like crazy.
###76 And I thought, well, let me see whether I can do
###77 something with that.
###80 This is one of the sweaters that we made for the book.
###84 This is actually a dog sweater with a dog on it.
###89 The white part is Great Pyrenees.
###92 Very soft and nice.
###94 The brown dog is actually made from Newfoundland yarn.
###99 But I love that.
###100 My son wore that and was on the cover
###103 of the first edition.
###105 ANGIE SULLIVAN: OK, Kendall.
###106 Can you start with showing us what the first step is to
###109 knitting with dog hair?
###111 KENDALL CROLUIS: Well, the first step is getting a dog.
###113 And we have Rufus here with us today.
###116 He's a fabulous candidate for dog hair knitting.
###119 Right?
###120 Because you've got a fabulous coat.
###121 And we're going to brush you to get some of the stuff off
###125 you that we need.
###125 We're not going to shave you.
###127 We're not going to shear you.
###128 And we're not going to cut your hair.
###131 See whether you can get some good fuzz off of Rufus.
###133 ANGIE SULLIVAN: Yeah.
###134 KENDALL CROLUIS: Oh, yeah.
###135 Oh, he likes this.
###137 So we do this over a period of weeks or months till we've got
###141 a nice big bag of dog hair.
###144 And you can see, I can pull those off.
###146 And it's almost like cotton.
###149 Part of the appeal is that this garment that you've made
###152 is a memento of a pet that you've loved who maybe has
###155 gone on to dog heaven.
###157 Or the fashion statement of I'm walking down the street,
###161 and look, my scarf matches my golden
###163 retriever who I'm walking.
###166 Now we've collected all of this from the dog.
###169 And it's a little stinky.
###172 And we'd like to start the process of getting it clean.
###175 It's a little doggy.
###175 A little gamy.
###177 So we're gonna wash it.
###179 I tend to use dog shampoo.
###181 Just kind of mix it up.
###183 And then we're going to dump that.
###186 ANGIE SULLIVAN: Just throw it all in?
###186 KENDALL CROLUIS: Ew.
###187 Dog hair in the sink.
###187 So I'm gonna let that sit for five minutes.
###190 
###192 Well, there's really a wide range of reactions.
###196 ANGIE SULLIVAN: It's like cleaning out
###197 my drain in my shower.
###197 KENDALL CROLUIS: Exactly.
###198 Ew.
###199 I mean, there's some people, primarily dog lovers, who just
###202 think, this is the greatest thing since sliced bread.
###205 What a fantastic idea.
###207 And immediately see all of the wonderful possibilities
###209 inherent in dog knitting.
###212 There are other people who are completely grossed out.
###215 It's like, oh, that's disgusting.
###218 Why would you want to do that?
###220 And doesn't it smell like a wet dog?
###222 But the point is that you wash the fiber.
###224 So it actually doesn't smell like anything at all.
###227 Just as your wool sweaters don't smell, neither does a
###230 dog hair sweater.
###232 Give a sniff.
###232 ANGIE SULLIVAN: Yep.
###233 KENDALL CROLUIS: You know?
###235 No worries, right?
###235 ANGIE SULLIVAN: Yeah, yeah.
###236 KENDALL CROLUIS: So just like a sweater, I'm going to want
###238 to take some of that moisture out of it.
###240 Kind of roll it up in a towel, and that's a good way to get
###242 the moisture out without sort of wringing the sweater or
###245 wringing the dog hair.
###246 And so we just kind of spread those out so that there are no
###250 big, wet clumps sticking together.
###252 The next thing we're going to do is card it, which is kind
###255 of like brushing it so that we get all the fibers pointed in
###258 the same direction.
###259 
###265 ANGIE SULLIVAN: All right.
###266 So we brush the dog.
###268 KENDALL CROLUIS: We brush the dog.
###269 And we have the fuzz.
###270 And the next step is called carding.
###273 So what you do is you take some of your clean fuzz.
###276 And you're just gonna kind of stick it on there.
###279 And you're just gonna draw the combs across each other.
###285 And all this is doing is straightening out the fibers.
###288 Yep.
###290 See?
###291 Way to go?
###293 ANGIE SULLIVAN: And then what's the
###293 next step after that?
###294 KENDALL CROLUIS: The next step is actually to spin it.
###296 So I'm just going to kind of get that kicked
###298 in the right direction.
###300 I'm spinning that along.
###301 And I'm pulling out fibers.
###302 And I let go and let it twist.
###304 The spinning motion, the other wonderful thing, is it also
###307 then draws the finished yarn up on to this bobbin.
###311 There are two steps that you're going to
###312 do with your hand.
###314 You're going to pinch with your left hand.
###316 ANGIE SULLIVAN: OK.
###316 KENDALL CROLUIS: So nothing's twisting down here because
###319 you're pinching.
###320 And with your right hand, you're going to pull back a
###324 little bit on this yarn.
###325 See, let go a little bit.
###326 See?
###326 It twists.
###327 ANGIE SULLIVAN: Oh.
###328 KENDALL CROLUIS: And then you move your hand down here and
###330 do it again.
###331 ANGIE SULLIVAN: Oh.
###331 And this will be spinning it tighter.
###332 KENDALL CROLUIS: Yeah.
###333 So I'm going to start treadling real slow.
###334 OK.
###335 ANGIE SULLIVAN: All right.
###335 I'm just holding this?
###336 KENDALL CROLUIS: Now let go a little bit.
###337 Yep, yep.
###338 ANGIE SULLIVAN: Oh, I'm doing it.
###339 KENDALL CROLUIS: See?
###340 Look at you.
###340 You're a natural.
###341 You're a natural spinner.
###343 ANGIE SULLIVAN: So then I grab some more?
###344 KENDALL CROLUIS: Rapunzel.
###344 Way to go.
###345 Yep.
###345 Don't let go.
###347 OK.
###347 Now I'm going to slow down for a second.
###349 Now just glom some on there.
###351 ANGIE SULLIVAN: All right.
###352 KENDALL CROLUIS: Yep.
###352 Now you're getting a lot of twist there.
###354 Let it go.
###354 Let it go.
###355 ANGIE SULLIVAN: Uh oh.
###357 KENDALL CROLUIS: Yeah.
###357 So you're a little lumpy.
###358 But not bad.
###360 This is stuff that was just gonna clog up your vacuum
###363 cleaner, and here you can put it to good use.
###365 So it's economical and it's ecologically correct and
###370 environmentally sound.
###371 Very much an on-trend craft, I think.
###374 People often ask, I'm not really into dogs but I love my
###376 cats and can you spin cat hair?
###378 And the answer is absolutely.
###379 Anything you can do with dog hair you can do with cat hair.
###382 It's a little bit harder to work with because it has a
###384 tendency to mat.
###386 But I have done some gloves that's actually a Peaceable
###388 Kingdom Collection in that it's got both dog
###391 and cat yarn in it.
###393 I don't actually remember whose pets are
###396 which in all of this.
###398 But I do remember that the thumbs are cat hair.
###402 Let's start you with this.
###403 This is a golden retriever scarf.
###405 ANGIE SULLIVAN: All right.
###406 What was it's name.
###406 KENDALL CROLUIS: From Abigail.
###407 Abigail.
###407 ANGIE SULLIVAN: Abigail.
###408 KENDALL CROLUIS: And this looks great with a
###410 camel's hair coat.
###411 Just really a perfect match there.
###414 We'll give you two scarves.
###416 This is a woven scarf which is wool.
###418 ANGIE SULLIVAN: Is this also Abigail?
###419 KENDALL CROLUIS: That's also Abigail.
###420 Yep.
###421 She was very prolific in this department.
###423 This is a nice hat for you.
###425 It was a Newfoundland.
###426 I can't even remember who it came from.
###427 Now I think, it is a cold day.
###429 So let's give you the sweater as well.
###432 Now this is Great Pyrenees, this is from Ollie.
###434 Oh, you look great.
###436 I'll tell you.
###437 ANGIE SULLIVAN: All right.
###438 KENDALL CROLUIS: And then your hands must feel cold.
###439 ANGIE SULLIVAN: I feel like a polar bear.
###440 KENDALL CROLUIS: So you're gonna have dog and cat.
###443 
###446 Now you don't have the urge to go find a fire hydrant.
###448 
###451 Nothing like that?
###452 ANGIE SULLIVAN: No.
###452 Maybe bark at the neighbors or something.
###453 KENDALL CROLUIS: Yeah, that's good.
###454 Howl at the moon.
###455 Something like that.
###456 If you were allergic to dogs, no worries.
###459 Because--
###460 ANGIE SULLIVAN: Yeah.
###460 KENDALL CROLUIS: No, it's interesting.
###461 Because when you're allergic to dogs, you're actually not
###463 allergic to the fiber.
###465 You're allergic to the dander.
###467 ANGIE SULLIVAN: Oh, so once it's all clean [INAUDIBLE].
###469 KENDALL CROLUIS: So once it's washed and clean, there isn't
###470 any of that in there.
###471 And so even if you're allergic to dogs you can quite happily
###475 wear dog hair.
###475 ANGIE SULLIVAN: Anyone can wear this?
###477 KENDALL CROLUIS: Yeah.
###477 After we wrote the book and people kind of got into it,
###481 more people found out about it, I can't tell you how many
###483 letters I've received for people who said,
###485 oh, I got your book.
###487 And I made a scarf.
###488 And now Fluffy is gone and I can't tell you how grateful I
###493 am to have the scarf made from Fluffy.
###495 And I really have dozens of letters that say exactly that.
###499 So that's an important emotional
###501 connection to all of this.
###502 ANGIE SULLIVAN: Thanks, Kendall, for teaching us how
###504 to make dog hair yarn.
###506 KENDALL CROLUIS: Well, you're very welcome.
###507 ANGIE SULLIVAN: And to make sweaters out of it.
###508 KENDALL CROLUIS: And I'm delighted that you're wearing
###509 a dog hair sweater home whether you like it or not.
###513 Look at you.
###514 You're covered.
###515
