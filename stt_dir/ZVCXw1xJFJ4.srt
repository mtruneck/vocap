1
0:0:17,204 --> 0:0:41,545
The following program is brought
to you in living colour on NBC.


2
0:0:41,545 --> 0:0:43,187
Lieutenant Spock. Status report!


3
0:0:43,187 --> 0:0:46,26
I estimate it will fire in 23.4 seconds.


4
0:0:46,26 --> 0:0:48,521
Engineering, all power
to the aft shields.


5
0:0:48,521 --> 0:0:50,2
There is none to give, is there?


6
0:0:50,2 --> 0:0:51,794
Evasive manoeuvres, Mr Tyler!


7
0:0:51,794 --> 0:0:53,175
The helm is not responding, sir!


8
0:0:53,175 --> 0:0:56,749
Captain Pike, we are on emergency power.
Warp drive going critical.


9
0:0:56,749 --> 0:0:57,605
Thank you, Number One!


10
0:0:57,605 --> 0:0:58,908
10 seconds.


11
0:0:58,908 --> 0:1:2,84
All hands, this is the captain!
Prepare for saucer separation.


12
0:1:2,84 --> 0:1:37,567
I repeat, stand by to...


13
0:1:37,567 --> 0:1:40,827
Space, the final frontier.


14
0:1:40,827 --> 0:1:44,22
These are the new voyages of the Starship Enterprise


15
0:1:44,22 --> 0:1:48,381
Its five-year mission,
to explore strange new worlds.


16
0:1:48,381 --> 0:1:51,436
To seek out new life and new civilizations.


17
0:1:51,436 --> 0:4:2,107
To boldly go where no man has gone before.


18
0:4:2,107 --> 0:4:3,465
[Kirk] The Enterprise


19
0:4:3,465 --> 0:4:6,34
[Spock] Captain Kirk, I do not make this request lightly,


20
0:4:6,34 --> 0:4:9,376
but it is urgent that you alter course for gateway immediately.


21
0:4:9,376 --> 0:4:14,34
Mr Spock, I'm afraid, I don't know
what good a starship can do.


22
0:4:14,34 --> 0:4:17,487
I'm sure the scientists, there at project
"Timepiece," can handle this situation.


23
0:4:17,487 --> 0:4:18,612
I knew this wouldn't work.


24
0:4:18,612 --> 0:4:21,73
Captain, as I'm sure Lt Uhura has told you,


25
0:4:21,73 --> 0:4:23,627
my request has priority one authorization.


26
0:4:23,627 --> 0:4:27,305
You can confirm this with Starfleet
Command, but you must comply.


27
0:4:27,305 --> 0:4:29,969
Spock out.


28
0:4:29,969 --> 0:4:32,563
Well. Priority one it is!


29
0:4:32,563 --> 0:4:34,484
Lt Uhura, sound Red Alert.


30
0:4:34,484 --> 0:4:36,2
Helm, set course for "Gateway".


31
0:4:36,2 --> 0:4:39,318
Aye, sir. Coming to course
zero one one mark three zero.


32
0:4:39,318 --> 0:4:41,558
Commander, do you
foresee any difficulty in


33
0:4:41,558 --> 0:4:45,308
navigating the time waves,
within the Gateway system?


34
0:4:45,308 --> 0:4:48,18
Mr DeSalle should have
no difficulty, Captain.


35
0:4:48,18 --> 0:4:49,578
Very good, Commander Kargh.


36
0:4:49,578 --> 0:4:52,177
Helm, you heard our first Officer.
Maximum warp!


37
0:4:52,177 --> 0:5:22,243
Aye, sir.


38
0:5:22,243 --> 0:5:23,178
Welcome, Captain!


39
0:5:23,178 --> 0:5:24,555
Dr MacGregor, Thank you.


40
0:5:24,555 --> 0:5:26,998
This is my chief medical officer,
Dr Leonard McCoy


41
0:5:26,998 --> 0:5:28,587
My 1st Officer, Commander Kargh.


42
0:5:28,587 --> 0:5:32,168
How do you do?


43
0:5:32,168 --> 0:5:33,847
This is Commander Spock.


44
0:5:33,847 --> 0:5:39,553
Commander? There are no
Vulcans in Starfleet.


45
0:5:39,553 --> 0:5:45,466
Captain, as you know, project "Timepiece" was
established as a permanent research facility


46
0:5:45,466 --> 0:5:48,56
shortly after your discovery
of the artefact on this planet.


47
0:5:48,56 --> 0:5:50,872
Of course, Doctor. Your
reputation does precede you.


48
0:5:50,872 --> 0:5:55,588
Then I hope you will take us
seriously when we tell you,


49
0:5:55,588 --> 0:6:5,355
that the natural course
of time has been altered.


50
0:6:5,355 --> 0:6:7,537
These figures, represent the flow of time.


51
0:6:7,537 --> 0:6:9,225
The natural flow of time, yes.


52
0:6:9,225 --> 0:6:12,203
Here are the readings I
took only a few hours ago.


53
0:6:12,203 --> 0:6:14,915
This is at least a magnitude ten variation.


54
0:6:14,915 --> 0:6:18,509
10.2! From that point on,
history is no longer correct.


55
0:6:18,509 --> 0:6:21,423
And if that's not enough,
the same anti-protons signature


56
0:6:21,423 --> 0:6:23,71
shows up again, only a few months ago.


57
0:6:23,71 --> 0:6:26,337
Corresponding to our battle with the
planet devouring weapon.


58
0:6:26,337 --> 0:6:29,101
commonly known as the doomsday machine.


59
0:6:29,101 --> 0:6:30,743
Our battle?


60
0:6:30,743 --> 0:6:33,476
Captain, until this shift in time,


61
0:6:33,476 --> 0:6:39,833
Mr Spock was your first Officer,
aboard the Enterprise.


62
0:6:39,833 --> 0:6:41,568
Enterprise?


63
0:6:41,568 --> 0:6:42,608
There's no ship named...


64
0:6:42,608 --> 0:6:45,123
According to my research,
you and the crew of the Farragut,


65
0:6:45,123 --> 0:6:46,973
were assigned many of
the same missions,


66
0:6:46,973 --> 0:6:49,355
had many of the same experiences,


67
0:6:49,355 --> 0:6:52,203
shared many of the same crises
as the crew of the Enterprise.


68
0:6:52,203 --> 0:6:55,215
Parallel time-line development
is not without president.


69
0:6:55,215 --> 0:6:58,941
Does that includes letting Matt Decker
die senselessly in a shuttlecraft?


70
0:6:58,941 --> 0:7:1,576
Yes, including even that.


71
0:7:1,576 --> 0:7:5,87
That and your discovery of
this planet and the vortex.


72
0:7:5,87 --> 0:7:8,692
Captain, you loaned Cmdr Spock to us
as a research consultant.


73
0:7:8,692 --> 0:7:11,346
He was protected from the
changes in the time-line.


74
0:7:11,346 --> 0:7:13,804
As are we all, here on "Gateway".


75
0:7:13,804 --> 0:7:17,279
Cmdr Spock, the Farragut has done
battle with several of these killers


76
0:7:17,279 --> 0:7:18,914
since this "doomsday war" began.


77
0:7:18,914 --> 0:7:22,734
And Matt Decker was killed flying a
shuttlecraft into the doomsday weapon.


78
0:7:22,734 --> 0:7:25,77
When you detonated the Constellation
inside that same device


79
0:7:25,77 --> 0:7:28,407
Dr MacGregor instruments registered a smaller,


80
0:7:28,407 --> 0:7:31,346
yet otherwise identical anti-proton surge.


81
0:7:31,346 --> 0:7:35,484
So what you're really saying is,
you expect us to go back in time,


82
0:7:35,484 --> 0:7:38,637
and change history so things go your way?


83
0:7:38,637 --> 0:7:41,458
Well, this is our life! Our history.


84
0:7:41,458 --> 0:7:44,455
How do we know your "correct"
history is the right one?


85
0:7:44,455 --> 0:7:45,944
The best one?


86
0:7:45,944 --> 0:7:52,974
Because Jim here, in your time-line,
billions of people are dead!


87
0:7:52,974 --> 0:7:54,264
As you pointed out, Doctor,


88
0:7:54,264 --> 0:7:56,706
Vulcan and dozens of other worlds,
have been destroyed,


89
0:7:56,706 --> 0:8:0,69
in the 14 years since the first
of these machines appeared.


90
0:8:0,69 --> 0:8:2,67
In my time-line, those worlds are still there.


91
0:8:2,67 --> 0:8:6,91
Vibrant, thriving, filled with life.


92
0:8:6,91 --> 0:8:7,999
So, that's what we're supposed to do?


93
0:8:7,999 --> 0:8:10,598
Use the vortex to travel back in time,


94
0:8:10,598 --> 0:8:14,981
to 2254 and stop these things,
before they can start a war?


95
0:8:14,981 --> 0:8:17,647
Without the proper preparation,
you would be annihilated


96
0:8:17,647 --> 0:8:19,842
along with everything else in your path.


97
0:8:19,842 --> 0:8:22,584
First, we must gather more information.


98
0:8:22,584 --> 0:8:27,989
And exactly how do we do that?


99
0:8:27,989 --> 0:8:31,393
Sorry, I asked.


100
0:8:31,393 --> 0:8:34,624
It is our hope that by following
this smaller, more recent pulse,


101
0:8:34,624 --> 0:8:36,835
from your encounter with
the doomsday weapon,


102
0:8:36,835 --> 0:8:41,965
we might get some sense as to how these time-
deviations occur and how we might counter them.


103
0:8:41,965 --> 0:8:44,574
The pulse leads to Earth in the 1960s.


104
0:8:44,574 --> 0:8:46,958
A most tumultuous time in your history.


105
0:8:46,958 --> 0:8:50,483
So much so, in fact, that I am having
difficulty getting an accurate reading.


106
0:8:50,483 --> 0:8:53,977
Commander Spock,
I have located the pulse.


107
0:8:53,977 --> 0:8:58,102
The energy signature proceeds
through time until, ...there.


108
0:8:58,102 --> 0:8:59,744
This must be the focal point.


109
0:8:59,744 --> 0:9:2,871
The temporal foci should bring us
within immediate proximity of whatever


110
0:9:2,871 --> 0:9:4,103
is causing the disturbance.


111
0:9:4,103 --> 0:9:5,776
Our research indicates that


112
0:9:5,776 --> 0:9:9,712
you will automatically return
when your mission is a success.


113
0:9:9,712 --> 0:9:12,808
Donâ€™t ask me how the Guardian knows.


114
0:9:12,808 --> 0:9:15,646
Five years to go!


115
0:9:15,646 --> 0:9:17,31
Four!


116
0:9:17,31 --> 0:9:19,839
This was easier with my
veins full of cordrazine.


117
0:9:19,839 --> 0:9:21,463
Three.


118
0:9:21,463 --> 0:9:22,98
Two.


119
0:9:22,98 --> 0:9:38,9
Now, Captain.


120
0:9:38,9 --> 0:9:43,675
Commander, I thought you said
we were heading for the 1960s?


121
0:9:43,675 --> 0:9:47,252
This looks more like,
the end of the century.


122
0:9:47,252 --> 0:9:48,555
The beginning, actually!


123
0:9:48,555 --> 0:9:52,6
The readings indicate we have
successfully travelled to 2006,


124
0:9:52,6 --> 0:9:54,385
where the anti-proton
readings are the strongest.


125
0:9:54,385 --> 0:9:57,776
well done, Spock. Now what?


126
0:9:57,776 --> 0:10:0,676
The signal emanates from that direction.


127
0:10:0,676 --> 0:10:8,268
And what do you suggest we do?
Knock?


128
0:10:8,268 --> 0:10:9,468
Yes?


129
0:10:9,468 --> 0:10:11,168
Good afternoon, Miss...


130
0:10:11,168 --> 0:10:15,613
Oh, my...


131
0:10:15,613 --> 0:10:26,583
It's you!


132
0:10:26,583 --> 0:10:28,493
My name is Jim Kirk. We were hoping...


133
0:10:28,493 --> 0:10:31,96
Of course!


134
0:10:31,96 --> 0:10:33,74
Captain Kirk.


135
0:10:33,74 --> 0:10:44,134
Won't you come in, please?


136
0:10:44,134 --> 0:10:47,702
My name is Veronica.


137
0:10:47,702 --> 0:10:50,828
I'm so delighted that
you've finally made it.


138
0:10:50,828 --> 0:10:54,894
Ma'am.... Veronica,
you were expecting us?


139
0:10:54,894 --> 0:10:58,373
Well, I must admit, I had my doubts.


140
0:10:58,373 --> 0:11:14,339
I've been waiting a long time.
Please, sit down.


141
0:11:14,339 --> 0:11:18,911
He always said you'd show up.
Sooner or later.


142
0:11:18,911 --> 0:11:30,729
He made this tape for you.


143
0:11:30,729 --> 0:11:38,294
Yes, it works, it works! Just sit down!


144
0:11:38,294 --> 0:11:40,954
Hello there.


145
0:11:40,954 --> 0:11:43,408
Commodore Decker.


146
0:11:43,408 --> 0:11:45,83
Yes.


147
0:11:45,83 --> 0:11:47,519
He made this two years ago.


148
0:11:47,519 --> 0:11:50,315
He died 8 months later.


149
0:11:50,315 --> 0:11:52,652
Commodore Matthew Decker.


150
0:11:52,652 --> 0:11:56,304
This is my report.


151
0:11:56,304 --> 0:12:3,975
If you watching this tape, it means someone
from Starfleet, has come looking for me.


152
0:12:3,975 --> 0:12:6,851
I betting it's Jim Kirk.


153
0:12:6,851 --> 0:12:9,606
But, whoever it is,


154
0:12:9,606 --> 0:12:13,2
I'm sorry I missed seeing you.


155
0:12:13,2 --> 0:12:16,277
Now first of all: Please, don't worry.


156
0:12:16,277 --> 0:12:18,712
I did fine.


157
0:12:18,712 --> 0:12:20,769
Thanks to Veronica.


158
0:12:20,769 --> 0:12:24,8
You know that I commandeered a
shuttlecraft from the Farragut.


159
0:12:24,8 --> 0:12:31,14
And after setting a course
down the maul of that...


160
0:12:31,14 --> 0:12:33,971
Planet-killer.


161
0:12:33,971 --> 0:12:37,805
I locked the autopilot, in case I


162
0:12:37,805 --> 0:12:39,877
lost my nerve.


163
0:12:39,877 --> 0:12:47,51
One minute, I was staring into
the face of the devil incarnate.


164
0:12:47,51 --> 0:12:50,386
And the next I'm...


165
0:12:50,386 --> 0:12:52,743
flat on the floor,


166
0:12:52,743 --> 0:12:57,415
of the shuttlecraft.


167
0:12:57,415 --> 0:13:1,29
Drifting in space.
I must have blacked out.


168
0:13:1,29 --> 0:13:3,926
The thing was gone.


169
0:13:3,926 --> 0:13:6,411
The spaceships were gone.


170
0:13:6,411 --> 0:13:10,277
The radio was silent.


171
0:13:10,277 --> 0:13:13,72
All I could do was set
a course for Earth.


172
0:13:13,72 --> 0:13:16,187
But when I got here...


173
0:13:16,187 --> 0:13:20,221
I discovered, I was stuck in the past.


174
0:13:20,221 --> 0:13:24,854
I was in pretty bad shape.


175
0:13:24,854 --> 0:13:27,837
That was when Veronica found me.


176
0:13:27,837 --> 0:13:30,806
And nursed me back to health, as it were.


177
0:13:30,806 --> 0:13:33,482
helped me to find my place,


178
0:13:33,482 --> 0:13:37,573
make a home, here in the 20th century.


179
0:13:37,573 --> 0:13:40,965
Well, 21st now I guess.


180
0:13:40,965 --> 0:13:46,889
How many men can say that they
have seen three centuries?


181
0:13:46,889 --> 0:13:50,699
I suppose I should apologize to Admiral Leslie,


182
0:13:50,699 --> 0:13:54,147
for not trying harder to
get back where I started,


183
0:13:54,147 --> 0:14:1,121
But,... you have met Veronica.


184
0:14:1,121 --> 0:14:6,439
And now, it seems the years
have finally caught up with me.


185
0:14:6,439 --> 0:14:11,306
So, this is my final report.


186
0:14:11,306 --> 0:14:20,215
Decker, out.


187
0:14:20,215 --> 0:14:23,574
But this does not explain
the tricorder readings.


188
0:14:23,574 --> 0:14:27,242
Veronica, did Matt leave anything else?


189
0:14:27,242 --> 0:14:44,636
You might say that. Yes.


190
0:14:44,636 --> 0:14:46,567
Does this explain your tricorder readings?


191
0:14:46,567 --> 0:14:50,642
Yes, Captain. The shuttlecraft, which
disappeared along with Commodore Decker.


192
0:14:50,642 --> 0:14:52,69
If the micro-tapes are still intact,


193
0:14:52,69 --> 0:14:57,265
Check it out, Spock.


194
0:14:57,265 --> 0:15:18,26
Matt wanted me to give this to you.


195
0:15:18,26 --> 0:15:19,372
Welcome back!


196
0:15:19,372 --> 0:15:22,999
Since you're here, I assume...


197
0:15:22,999 --> 0:15:26,437
Fascinating. Commodore Decker's
sensor data would indicate


198
0:15:26,437 --> 0:15:28,995
that the weapon's conversion
drive emits chronitons.


199
0:15:28,995 --> 0:15:29,942
Chronitons?


200
0:15:29,942 --> 0:15:32,257
A quantum particle of time.


201
0:15:32,257 --> 0:15:36,312
Concentrations of chronitons can cause
anomalous behaviour in the local time flow.


202
0:15:36,312 --> 0:15:39,791
The Klingon Empire studied the use of chronitons.


203
0:15:39,791 --> 0:15:42,133
They were highly unstable.


204
0:15:42,133 --> 0:15:44,96
Dr MacGregor, I noticed the Enterprise


205
0:15:44,96 --> 0:15:45,931
was mentioned several times throughout your logs.


206
0:15:45,931 --> 0:15:48,851
Oh Yes, Captain. The Enterprise
seems to have a knack for


207
0:15:48,851 --> 0:15:51,769
being at the centre of things.


208
0:15:51,769 --> 0:15:53,341
Enterprise.


209
0:15:53,341 --> 0:15:56,207
Fascinating.


210
0:15:56,207 --> 0:15:57,54
[Computer] Working...


211
0:15:57,54 --> 0:15:59,925
The Enterprise was the first ship,
to encounter the planet killer.


212
0:15:59,925 --> 0:16:0,909
Yes, Captain.


213
0:16:0,909 --> 0:16:2,798
And it was destroyed almost immediately.


214
0:16:2,798 --> 0:16:4,129
Also true, Doctor.


215
0:16:4,129 --> 0:16:6,916
In your time-line, not in mine.


216
0:16:6,916 --> 0:16:9,31
Then the Enterprise is the key


217
0:16:9,31 --> 0:16:11,914
Was it not supposed to be there,
so that its crew would survive?


218
0:16:11,914 --> 0:16:15,589
Or perhaps it is the planet killer,
which was in the wrong place.


219
0:16:15,589 --> 0:16:17,732
The wrong time, Mr Kargh.


220
0:16:17,732 --> 0:16:19,971
Do you mean that thing
came from the future?


221
0:16:19,971 --> 0:16:20,952
Yes, Doctor.


222
0:16:20,952 --> 0:16:24,296
It arrived in your time where there
was no power great enough to stop it.


223
0:16:24,296 --> 0:16:30,614
And it began burning worlds
to fuel its anti-proton engine.


224
0:16:30,614 --> 0:16:36,332
The "Doomsday War". Which was
never supposed to happened.


225
0:16:36,332 --> 0:16:38,848
Mr Kargh, you said chronitons were unstable.


226
0:16:38,848 --> 0:16:40,131
Yes, sir.


227
0:16:40,131 --> 0:16:43,617
Could that be what happened, then?
When we detonated the Constellation,


228
0:16:43,617 --> 0:16:46,463
could we have somehow of caused
a dangerous chroniton-burst?


229
0:16:46,463 --> 0:16:49,143
And a smaller reaction from the
shuttlecraft could have triggered


230
0:16:49,143 --> 0:16:51,899
the chronitons to send
Commodore Decker back in time.


231
0:16:51,899 --> 0:16:53,522
Commander Spock


232
0:16:53,522 --> 0:16:55,747
Could we somehow use
that to our advantage?


233
0:16:55,747 --> 0:16:58,757
Cause a reaction that would send
this thing back to its own time?


234
0:16:58,757 --> 0:16:59,678
No, Captain.


235
0:16:59,678 --> 0:17:1,635
One starship would not
be able to generate


236
0:17:1,635 --> 0:17:4,763
a reaction of sufficient magnitude.


237
0:17:4,763 --> 0:17:6,262
Understood.


238
0:17:6,262 --> 0:17:7,921
And two?


239
0:17:7,921 --> 0:17:10,64
Two ships, would have a better chance.


240
0:17:10,64 --> 0:17:15,239
Jim, what are you thinking?
We don't have two ships.


241
0:17:15,239 --> 0:17:20,277
Yes, we do, Bones!


242
0:17:20,277 --> 0:17:21,877
We have the Enterprise.


243
0:17:21,877 --> 0:17:24,715
The Enterprise is in the past.


244
0:17:24,715 --> 0:17:26,32
Time-travel, Captain?


245
0:17:26,32 --> 0:17:28,358
We know exactly where and when the Enterprise will


246
0:17:28,358 --> 0:17:32,584
encounter the first doomsday machine.
If we could be there at the same time...


247
0:17:32,584 --> 0:17:35,752
Captain, the slingshot effect is not precise.


248
0:17:35,752 --> 0:17:41,111
We could emerge hours or weeks from our target.


249
0:17:41,111 --> 0:17:53,415
That may not be necessary.


250
0:17:53,415 --> 0:17:56,82
Shuttlecraft McAuliffe. You have
been cleared for restricted airspace.


251
0:17:56,82 --> 0:17:59,137
Continue on this heading until instructed to land.


252
0:17:59,137 --> 0:18:2,117
Affirmative.
McAuliffe out.


253
0:18:2,117 --> 0:18:4,313
If this area wasn't so
heavily shielded we would...


254
0:18:4,313 --> 0:18:6,2
We would have used
the transporter.


255
0:18:6,2 --> 0:18:49,652
Where would be the fun of it?


256
0:18:49,652 --> 0:18:52,525
Professor Daniels discovered
this about eight months ago.


257
0:18:52,525 --> 0:18:56,491
A natural dam burst downstream
and all of this was exposed.


258
0:18:56,491 --> 0:18:58,118
The Federation pronounced it off-limits


259
0:18:58,118 --> 0:19:0,38
and certainly we all had clearance level Alpha.


260
0:19:0,38 --> 0:19:1,335
No kidding.


261
0:19:1,335 --> 0:19:3,239
I'm trying to figure out what it's for.


262
0:19:3,239 --> 0:19:4,509
Colonization, perhaps.


263
0:19:4,509 --> 0:19:7,996
- Or invasion.
- Or research or espionage


264
0:19:7,996 --> 0:19:12,963
or purely voyeurism.
The "why" has been our biggest question.


265
0:19:12,963 --> 0:19:14,227
You have studied it, of course.


266
0:19:14,227 --> 0:19:16,117
Not as much as we'd like.


267
0:19:16,117 --> 0:19:19,18
To tell you the truth,
we are a little afraid of it.


268
0:19:19,18 --> 0:19:21,131
That is wise.


269
0:19:21,131 --> 0:19:25,107
If you intend to use this, to take
the Farragut back in time,


270
0:19:25,107 --> 0:19:30,34
my primary concern is whether or not it will operate,
once it's cut loose and towed into space.


271
0:19:30,34 --> 0:19:33,796
It's my thought too, but you might have
to use your tractor beam, to control...


272
0:19:33,796 --> 0:19:36,451
No, we won't.


273
0:19:36,451 --> 0:19:37,596
Mr DeSalle?


274
0:19:37,596 --> 0:19:38,623
Well, sir,


275
0:19:38,623 --> 0:19:40,791
I think I can fly Farragut


276
0:19:40,791 --> 0:19:43,209
straight into this thing.


277
0:19:43,209 --> 0:19:45,423
What?
You mean down here?


278
0:19:45,423 --> 0:19:47,186
You have the precise dimensions, right?


279
0:19:47,186 --> 0:19:48,275
Well, of course.


280
0:19:48,275 --> 0:19:51,144
There's got to be less than a
100 feet clearance behind there.


281
0:19:51,144 --> 0:19:53,122
If we're wrong about the
way this thing works...


282
0:19:53,122 --> 0:19:56,767
Yes, we'll wind up as
cave paintings. I know.


283
0:19:56,767 --> 0:19:59,356
Maybe, a test using a shuttlecraft?


284
0:19:59,356 --> 0:20:1,258
[Communicator rings] Kirk, here.


285
0:20:1,258 --> 0:20:4,786
Captain, long range sensors have
picked up a doomsday-machine.


286
0:20:4,786 --> 0:20:6,864
Heading and distance?


287
0:20:6,864 --> 0:20:9,927
Sir, it's on a direct course to planet "Gateway"


288
0:20:9,927 --> 0:20:10,632
Here?


289
0:20:10,632 --> 0:20:15,303
They have been known to track the Warp signatures
of starships, for several hundred light years.


290
0:20:15,303 --> 0:20:17,166
They followed us.


291
0:20:17,166 --> 0:20:19,926
Estimates put it in firing range in two hours!


292
0:20:19,926 --> 0:20:22,38
Keep me posted, Lieutenant. Kirk out.


293
0:20:22,38 --> 0:20:25,911
Well that's, that. We don't have time for a test!


294
0:20:25,911 --> 0:20:28,678
Mr DeSalle, a starship is a creature of space.


295
0:20:28,678 --> 0:20:33,329
It's not meant to be flown in the atmosphere and
certainly not at the velocities we're discussing here.


296
0:20:33,329 --> 0:20:35,77
Yes, sir.


297
0:20:35,77 --> 0:20:38,821
But I think I can do this.


298
0:20:38,821 --> 0:20:39,929
Kirk to Farragut.


299
0:20:39,929 --> 0:20:41,797
Rand here, Captain.


300
0:20:41,797 --> 0:20:44,2
Lt, notify the hangar deck


301
0:20:44,2 --> 0:20:45,76
and prepare the crew for collision.


302
0:20:45,76 --> 0:20:47,597
- Sir?
- You heard me, Rand.


303
0:20:47,597 --> 0:20:49,625
Captain, I know Chris Pike.


304
0:20:49,625 --> 0:20:51,695
He will not be easy to convince.


305
0:20:51,695 --> 0:20:53,324
Commander?


306
0:20:53,324 --> 0:20:56,17
Open your mind, Jim.


307
0:20:56,17 --> 0:20:58,421
Our minds are merging.


308
0:20:58,421 --> 0:21:0,83
My thoughts, to your thoughts.


309
0:21:0,83 --> 0:21:6,592
This one memory - I share with you.


310
0:21:6,592 --> 0:21:8,322
Talos.


311
0:21:8,322 --> 0:21:19,284
Spock, what are you doing to him?


312
0:21:19,284 --> 0:21:20,835
Thank you.


313
0:21:20,835 --> 0:21:24,278
Spock.


314
0:21:24,278 --> 0:21:26,276
Jim, are you okay?


315
0:21:26,276 --> 0:21:29,33
I'm fine, Bones, fine.


316
0:21:29,33 --> 0:21:32,174
Right now we've got to get Mr DeSalle
back in the driver's seat.


317
0:21:32,174 --> 0:21:34,631
- Spock, you will remain here.
- Agreed, Captain.


318
0:21:34,631 --> 0:21:36,636
Youâ€™re not really going to do this?


319
0:21:36,636 --> 0:21:39,189
Well, considering our options,
doctor, we don't have a choice.


320
0:21:39,189 --> 0:21:44,393
It's insane, we know nothing about this device.


321
0:21:44,393 --> 0:21:47,305
I can transmit the specifications from my office.


322
0:21:47,305 --> 0:21:49,87
But someone will have to stay to activate it.


323
0:21:49,87 --> 0:22:0,261
I do have some experience in that regard.


324
0:22:0,261 --> 0:22:3,341
[Intercom] All decks, this is the captain speaking.


325
0:22:3,341 --> 0:22:5,669
You all know what we're about to do.


326
0:22:5,669 --> 0:22:7,887
Youâ€™re aware of what's at stake.


327
0:22:7,887 --> 0:22:10,804
No matter what happens, I want you all to know,


328
0:22:10,804 --> 0:22:14,297
that there's no other crew,
I'd rather serve with.


329
0:22:14,297 --> 0:22:16,217
On any vessel.


330
0:22:16,217 --> 0:22:17,856
Kirk out.


331
0:22:17,856 --> 0:22:19,412
Status report, Mr Scott?


332
0:22:19,412 --> 0:22:21,293
Engineering ready as always, Captain.


333
0:22:21,293 --> 0:22:21,936
DeSalle?


334
0:22:21,936 --> 0:22:22,839
Helm standing by.


335
0:22:22,839 --> 0:22:23,596
Rand?


336
0:22:23,596 --> 0:22:24,868
Navigation ready, sir.


337
0:22:24,868 --> 0:22:25,354
Mr Kargh?


338
0:22:25,354 --> 0:22:26,94
Ship's systems show green, Captain.


339
0:22:26,94 --> 0:22:29,567
Structural and aerodynamic
force fields at maximum.


340
0:22:29,567 --> 0:22:30,644
Lt Uhura?


341
0:22:30,644 --> 0:22:34,746
All decks report ready, sir. Telemetry output
established with the Vulcan's tricorder.


342
0:22:34,746 --> 0:22:36,76
Opinion, Doctor?


343
0:22:36,76 --> 0:22:37,697
I think you're a damn fool.


344
0:22:37,697 --> 0:22:40,23
And that guy with the ears is even worse.


345
0:22:40,23 --> 0:22:42,648
I'll take that as a "yes," then Bones.


346
0:22:42,648 --> 0:22:46,446
Mr DeSalle, Red Alert.
Take us in.


347
0:22:46,446 --> 0:22:56,682
Aye, sir.


348
0:22:56,682 --> 0:22:58,553
Lt Uhura, open a channel to the surface.


349
0:22:58,553 --> 0:22:59,645
Aye, sir.


350
0:22:59,645 --> 0:23:2,598
Cmdr Spock, our nose is pointed towards the barn!


351
0:23:2,598 --> 0:23:4,712
I suggest you open the door.


352
0:23:4,712 --> 0:23:10,247
Very well, Captain.


353
0:23:10,247 --> 0:23:11,552
What are you?


354
0:23:11,552 --> 0:23:13,853
A question!


355
0:23:13,853 --> 0:23:15,488
Gateway, I wish to...


356
0:23:15,488 --> 0:23:18,246
Since before your sun burned hot in space,


357
0:23:18,246 --> 0:23:20,832
and before your race was born


358
0:23:20,832 --> 0:23:28,133
I have awaited, a question.


359
0:23:28,133 --> 0:23:29,967
Range to go: 50 kilometres.


360
0:23:29,967 --> 0:23:35,9
Come on, Spock.


361
0:23:35,9 --> 0:23:39,655
Gateway, I wish to view the history of the planet Earth!


362
0:23:39,655 --> 0:24:4,58
Now, DeSalle.


363
0:24:4,58 --> 0:24:8,54
Hold your positions, everyone.


364
0:24:8,54 --> 0:24:9,78
Lt Uhura, status report.


365
0:24:9,78 --> 0:24:11,411
All decks report ready, Captain.


366
0:24:11,411 --> 0:24:13,35
No injuries or casualties, sir.


367
0:24:13,35 --> 0:24:14,293
Mr Rand?


368
0:24:14,293 --> 0:24:17,224
All astro-navigation landmarks, confirmed.


369
0:24:17,224 --> 0:24:20,767
We are 14 years in the past, Captain. The year 2254.


370
0:24:20,767 --> 0:24:22,839
Well-done, Mr DeSalle. Well-done.


371
0:24:22,839 --> 0:24:27,478
Sir.


372
0:24:27,478 --> 0:24:39,441
The Enterprise.


373
0:24:39,441 --> 0:24:42,774
Scanning.


374
0:24:42,774 --> 0:24:47,206
Confirmed. Registry NCC-1701.
Constitution class.


375
0:24:47,206 --> 0:24:49,929
And in a hurry to get
wherever it's going.


376
0:24:49,929 --> 0:24:50,884
Hail them, Lieutenant.


377
0:24:50,884 --> 0:24:52,45
Hailing frequencies open.


378
0:24:52,45 --> 0:24:57,652
This is Captain James T. Kirk of the
USS Farragut, calling the Enterprise.


379
0:24:57,652 --> 0:25:1,508
This is the U.S.S. Enterprise,
Capt Christopher Pike, commanding.


380
0:25:1,508 --> 0:25:4,425
And Steve Garrovick is
Captain of the Farragut.


381
0:25:4,425 --> 0:25:6,23
So who the devil are you?


382
0:25:6,23 --> 0:25:9,209
That's going to be, somewhat difficult to explain.


383
0:25:9,209 --> 0:25:12,567
But it's absolutely vital that
you listen to what I have to say.


384
0:25:12,567 --> 0:25:14,75
I invite you to beam aboard the Farragut.


385
0:25:14,75 --> 0:25:16,753
Bring your senior staff
with you if you prefer.


386
0:25:16,753 --> 0:25:20,468
Captain, I have verified their ship's
registry and command codes.


387
0:25:20,468 --> 0:25:23,25
But much of the vessels internal configuration


388
0:25:23,25 --> 0:25:25,923
does not match fleet specifications.


389
0:25:25,923 --> 0:25:30,93
- I can explain that, too.
- I just bet you can.


390
0:25:30,93 --> 0:25:32,3
How about this, "Captain"?


391
0:25:32,3 --> 0:25:34,524
You and your senior officers beam over here.


392
0:25:34,524 --> 0:25:37,941
And I promise, I'll have a security team standing by.


393
0:25:37,941 --> 0:25:39,834
Pike out.


394
0:25:39,834 --> 0:25:42,54
Number one, care to hear this explanation?


395
0:25:42,54 --> 0:25:43,75
Certainly, sir.


396
0:25:43,75 --> 0:26:17,571
Dr Boyce, meet us
in the transporter room.


397
0:26:17,571 --> 0:26:20,871
You bring a Klingon to my ship,
and I'm supposed to trust you?


398
0:26:20,871 --> 0:26:23,552
All explanations are off,
take them to the brig.


399
0:26:23,552 --> 0:26:24,459
No, wait!


400
0:26:24,459 --> 0:26:28,473
Captain Pike, you're right.


401
0:26:28,473 --> 0:26:36,85
At least sort of...
It's well...


402
0:26:36,85 --> 0:26:37,824
We're from your future.


403
0:26:37,824 --> 0:26:38,91
Well, Doctor?


404
0:26:38,91 --> 0:26:42,35
They are as they appear to be.
Two humans and one Klingon.


405
0:26:42,35 --> 0:26:44,939
Completely normal.
As for if they are from the future...


406
0:26:44,939 --> 0:26:48,202
Fleet personal roster, shows a James T. Kirk


407
0:26:48,202 --> 0:26:51,745
assigned to USS  Farragut, Lieutenant Junior Grade.


408
0:26:51,745 --> 0:26:52,569
Captain Pike, you were about...


409
0:26:52,569 --> 0:26:54,686
You still havenâ€™t said why you
are commanding the Farragut.


410
0:26:54,686 --> 0:26:58,27
I have been in command of the Farragut for
the last ten years. Since Garrovick died.


411
0:26:58,27 --> 0:27:0,86
It's not in the computer.


412
0:27:0,86 --> 0:27:1,742
We could have destroyed
you with our torpedoes,


413
0:27:1,742 --> 0:27:6,125
long before we were in range of your phasers.
Have you asked yourselves why we didn't?


414
0:27:6,125 --> 0:27:7,4
I can think of a hundred reasons.


415
0:27:7,4 --> 0:27:10,528
Perhaps to commandeer the
Enterprise, as you did Farragut.


416
0:27:10,528 --> 0:27:13,734
I didn't commandeer the Farragut.
You are approaching a source of


417
0:27:13,734 --> 0:27:15,654
high temporal disturbance, am I right?


418
0:27:15,654 --> 0:27:18,73
[Intercom] Spock here. Captain, we are approaching


419
0:27:18,73 --> 0:27:20,794
the coordinates of the temporal disturbance.


420
0:27:20,794 --> 0:27:22,65
Thank you, Lieutenant.


421
0:27:22,65 --> 0:27:24,416
have Mr Tyler reduce speed to half impulse.


422
0:27:24,416 --> 0:27:27,148
And when you get there, you'll find
a device that's so destructive,


423
0:27:27,148 --> 0:27:30,106
it will be laying waste to planets
for many years to come.


424
0:27:30,106 --> 0:27:34,626
Chris, someone told me that you
were going to be difficult to convince.


425
0:27:34,626 --> 0:27:37,692
He told me to remind you that you
once lost your heart on a world


426
0:27:37,692 --> 0:27:40,889
where leaves sing and dreams find life.


427
0:27:40,889 --> 0:27:42,415
Who told you that?


428
0:27:42,415 --> 0:27:47,954
Another Starfleet officer who holds
his former Captain in high regard.


429
0:27:47,954 --> 0:27:51,824
They tell me he is going to be
my first Officer in the future.


430
0:27:51,824 --> 0:27:57,323
At least, if we survive,
to face the future.


431
0:27:57,323 --> 0:28:0,712
Commander Spock.


432
0:28:0,712 --> 0:28:1,383
Report.


433
0:28:1,383 --> 0:28:5,778
Captain, we're approaching the
coordinates of the time ripple.


434
0:28:5,778 --> 0:28:16,703
And we are not the only one.


435
0:28:16,703 --> 0:28:17,896
Raise the Klingon.


436
0:28:17,896 --> 0:28:19,418
No response, Captain.


437
0:28:19,418 --> 0:28:20,926
It's not the same.


438
0:28:20,926 --> 0:28:24,808
No. But maybe this is what they looked
like before giving years of battle.


439
0:28:24,808 --> 0:28:28,186
Or perhaps this is a design from the opposing side.


440
0:28:28,186 --> 0:28:30,506
The winning side.


441
0:28:30,506 --> 0:28:33,934
Do you have something to share?


442
0:28:33,934 --> 0:28:38,221
Captain, that is an unmanned
weapon from the future.


443
0:28:38,221 --> 0:28:43,269
That's ridiculous. It would have been impossible
for a technology to have advanced so quickly.


444
0:28:43,269 --> 0:28:44,486
It is not our weapon.


445
0:28:44,486 --> 0:28:46,789
But we do have an idea on
how to destroy this thing.


446
0:28:46,789 --> 0:28:50,586
My science officer will provide you
with the necessary specifications.


447
0:28:50,586 --> 0:28:53,327
Chris, our two ships are going
to have to work together,


448
0:28:53,327 --> 0:28:59,899
if we are going to destroy this thing.


449
0:28:59,899 --> 0:29:4,523
You have one minute to beam back
to your ship and transmit the data.


450
0:29:4,523 --> 0:29:5,677
Kirk to Farragut.


451
0:29:5,677 --> 0:29:8,94
Get us back quick, Rand.
And stand-by to raise


452
0:29:8,94 --> 0:29:9,759
the deflector shields,
as soon as we're aboard.


453
0:29:9,759 --> 0:29:13,46
Yes, sir.


454
0:29:13,46 --> 0:29:14,397
Red Alert.


455
0:29:14,397 --> 0:29:18,302
Shields at full intensity.


456
0:29:18,302 --> 0:29:21,307
Red Alert. All hands man your battle stations.


457
0:29:21,307 --> 0:29:24,83
This is not a drill.


458
0:29:24,83 --> 0:29:27,212
- You know what to do, Mr Kargh?
- Aye, sir.


459
0:29:27,212 --> 0:29:29,44
Rand, plot an intercept course.


460
0:29:29,44 --> 0:29:36,38
Let's see if we can take some
of the heat off the Klingons


461
0:29:36,38 --> 0:29:38,999
Ships weapons at full charge, Captain.


462
0:29:38,999 --> 0:29:40,975
I suggest you target these coordinates.


463
0:29:40,975 --> 0:29:44,151
Very good. Mr Tyler, one
quick pass, to get its attention.


464
0:29:44,151 --> 0:29:55,607
Aye, sir.


465
0:29:55,607 --> 0:29:57,636
I think you've got its attention, Captain.


466
0:29:57,636 --> 0:30:0,912
Recharge weapons. Number one,
what's your summary of Kirk's data?


467
0:30:0,912 --> 0:30:5,821
I'd say they are being optimistic, Captain.


468
0:30:5,821 --> 0:30:8,469
That was a disruptor hit.


469
0:30:8,469 --> 0:30:11,36
Captain, the Klingon is firing at the Enterprise.


470
0:30:11,36 --> 0:30:13,519
- Hail them.
- The Klingon is hailing us, sir.


471
0:30:13,519 --> 0:30:15,153
I'm Captain James T....


472
0:30:15,153 --> 0:30:18,314
Stay out of this fight, Earther.


473
0:30:18,314 --> 0:30:22,757
We don't need help from your garbage scow.
And your weapons of peace.


474
0:30:22,757 --> 0:30:27,201
And your weakling starship.
This prize is ours!


475
0:30:27,201 --> 0:30:32,729
Commander, without our help,
there will be no prize. You will die.


476
0:30:32,729 --> 0:30:35,491
With honour.
(Evasive action)


477
0:30:35,491 --> 0:30:36,329
Father.


478
0:30:36,329 --> 0:30:39,549
Who dares?


479
0:30:39,549 --> 0:30:41,6
I am Kargh.


480
0:30:41,6 --> 0:30:43,88
Son of Korogh and Bregia.


481
0:30:43,88 --> 0:30:44,281
(I speak the truth)


482
0:30:44,281 --> 0:30:45,751
Sir.


483
0:30:45,751 --> 0:30:48,654
The Enterprise is signalling, ready!


484
0:30:48,654 --> 0:30:52,67
I see my son in you


485
0:30:52,67 --> 0:30:55,176
But greatly changed.


486
0:30:55,176 --> 0:30:57,47
What sort of trick is this?


487
0:30:57,47 --> 0:30:59,72
It is no trick, father.


488
0:30:59,72 --> 0:31:3,964
We are joined with the Earthers
to stop this killing machine.


489
0:31:3,964 --> 0:31:5,67
Then together we shall!


490
0:31:5,67 --> 0:31:8,357
Then afterwards, you'll join me


491
0:31:8,357 --> 0:31:11,121
in skinning the Earthers!


492
0:31:11,121 --> 0:31:12,53
(Torpedoes fired)


493
0:31:12,53 --> 0:31:25,992
Father!


494
0:31:25,992 --> 0:31:28,399
Captain, it's turning back towards us.


495
0:31:28,399 --> 0:31:30,211
What the hell have they gotten us into?


496
0:31:30,211 --> 0:31:32,321
Deflector modifications completed.


497
0:31:32,321 --> 0:31:34,235
Waiting on the signal from Farragut.


498
0:31:34,235 --> 0:31:37,125
I'm getting pretty damn tired of waiting for this Captain Kirk!


499
0:31:37,125 --> 0:31:47,992
We'll send that monster back where it came from.


500
0:31:47,992 --> 0:31:48,786
Captain.


501
0:31:48,786 --> 0:31:50,792
I see it, Mr Kargh.


502
0:31:50,792 --> 0:31:55,313
As soon as we're into position,
fire into that thing.


503
0:31:55,313 --> 0:31:58,928
Captain, engineering reports,
deflector is over 120 percent.


504
0:31:58,928 --> 0:32:1,204
It was never made for this kind of work.


505
0:32:1,204 --> 0:32:3,323
The Enterprise wants to live
as much as we do, number one.


506
0:32:3,323 --> 0:32:10,678
You won't fail us!


507
0:32:10,678 --> 0:32:12,284
It is preparing to fire, Captain.


508
0:32:12,284 --> 0:32:13,665
Keep us out of reach, DeSalle.


509
0:32:13,665 --> 0:32:19,47
That was my plan, sir.


510
0:32:19,47 --> 0:32:20,825
Kyle, take over navigation.


511
0:32:20,825 --> 0:32:27,475
Dr McCoy to the bridge.
Medical emergency.


512
0:32:27,475 --> 0:32:29,816
You call that, staying out of reach, Mister?


513
0:32:29,816 --> 0:32:31,24
No, sir.


514
0:32:31,24 --> 0:32:32,959
Uhura, can you raise the Enterprise?


515
0:32:32,959 --> 0:32:34,874
I'll try, sir.


516
0:32:34,874 --> 0:32:36,953
Enterprise, this is Farragut.


517
0:32:36,953 --> 0:32:39,745
Come in, Enterprise... do you read?


518
0:32:39,745 --> 0:32:41,84
Farragut calling Enterprise.
Please respond.


519
0:32:41,84 --> 0:32:43,178
- Acknowledge.
- Aye, sir.


520
0:32:43,178 --> 0:32:45,162
- This is crazy.
- Steady, Mr Tyler.


521
0:32:45,162 --> 0:32:48,529
In order to make this work, we have to
stay right in the line of fire. This is suicide.


522
0:32:48,529 --> 0:33:1,579
It's turning towards us again.


523
0:33:1,579 --> 0:33:8,2
- Mr DeSalle.
- I'm trying, Captain.


524
0:33:8,2 --> 0:33:9,507
Status, Mr Scott?


525
0:33:9,507 --> 0:33:18,321
The circuits overloaded, Captain!


526
0:33:18,321 --> 0:33:21,297
- How long do you intend this to go on?
- As long as it takes.


527
0:33:21,297 --> 0:33:23,679
Captain, the Enterprise cannot survive another attack.


528
0:33:23,679 --> 0:33:25,27
Sir, Enterprise is charging weapons.


529
0:33:25,27 --> 0:33:28,604
Anti-proton readings are spiking.
The planet killer is also preparing to fire.


530
0:33:28,604 --> 0:33:29,63
They'll be destroyed...


531
0:33:29,63 --> 0:33:31,64
Kyle! DeSalle!


532
0:33:31,64 --> 0:33:32,961
Primary systems failing.


533
0:33:32,961 --> 0:33:34,87
Can't control the circuits, sir.


534
0:33:34,87 --> 0:33:35,738
I am getting high anti-proton readings.


535
0:33:35,738 --> 0:33:37,25
All hands brace for impact.


536
0:33:37,25 --> 0:33:47,338
Enterprise hold your fire.


537
0:33:47,338 --> 0:33:48,388
Well I'll be damned!


538
0:33:48,388 --> 0:33:51,744
The Farragut distracted it.
Made it stop firing at us.


539
0:33:51,744 --> 0:33:53,405
Kirk took the heat of us.


540
0:33:53,405 --> 0:33:55,271
Let's see if we can do the same for him.


541
0:33:55,271 --> 0:33:57,686
- Under and over, Mr Tyler.
- Aye, sir.


542
0:33:57,686 --> 0:34:0,607
Captain. I have been studying
the data from their planet-killer.


543
0:34:0,607 --> 0:34:3,75
There may be a way to slow it down,
but it involves a...


544
0:34:3,75 --> 0:34:9,122
... considerable amount of waste.


545
0:34:9,122 --> 0:34:11,818
All this, for a history we don't know?


546
0:34:11,818 --> 0:34:14,723
For people we may or may not become?


547
0:34:14,723 --> 0:34:17,141
Captain. Call it off while you still can.


548
0:34:17,141 --> 0:34:25,663
Shield energy is fluctuating, Captain.


549
0:34:25,663 --> 0:34:28,62
Sir, the Enterprise, it is gone!


550
0:34:28,62 --> 0:34:34,421
Gone?


551
0:34:34,421 --> 0:34:37,399
They intercepted the beam meant for us - and then


552
0:34:37,399 --> 0:34:49,173
Vaporized!


553
0:34:49,173 --> 0:34:54,909
Casualty reports coming in from all decks, sir.


554
0:34:54,909 --> 0:34:56,618
- Kyle.
- Sir?


555
0:34:56,618 --> 0:34:58,963
Class-K planetoid, bearing two three zero.


556
0:34:58,963 --> 0:35:0,399
Are we going to hide, Captain?


557
0:35:0,399 --> 0:35:10,454
Hide? Your damn right, Mr Kargh.
Because I'm not ready to die with honour.


558
0:35:10,454 --> 0:35:13,437
Kirk, this is Pike. Veer off!. Veer off!


559
0:35:13,437 --> 0:35:14,284
Captain, it's...


560
0:35:14,284 --> 0:35:23,463
Do it, helm, full thrusters.


561
0:35:23,463 --> 0:35:24,298
(Success)


562
0:35:24,298 --> 0:35:25,869
That will take the wind out of her. Right or not.


563
0:35:25,869 --> 0:35:29,182
Kirk, if that fancy ship of yours,
can get off the mat,


564
0:35:29,182 --> 0:35:30,948
it's time we finished this thing off.


565
0:35:30,948 --> 0:35:32,386
Aye, Aye, Captain.


566
0:35:32,386 --> 0:35:38,199
Helm, firing position.


567
0:35:38,199 --> 0:35:41,2
- Keep it steady, Mr Tyler.
- I'm trying, sir.


568
0:35:41,2 --> 0:35:44,121
- Number one?
- Readings are off the scale, Captain.


569
0:35:44,121 --> 0:35:49,58
It is working.


570
0:35:49,58 --> 0:35:52,829
Lt Uhura, stand down from
red alert and hail the Enterprise.


571
0:35:52,829 --> 0:35:54,323
Coming on screen, sir.


572
0:35:54,323 --> 0:35:56,1
- Captain.
- Captain.


573
0:35:56,1 --> 0:35:57,159
Well, Kirk.


574
0:35:57,159 --> 0:36:0,674
I'm surprised to see that fancy ship,
of yours, still in one piece.


575
0:36:0,674 --> 0:36:4,73
Looks like the Enterprise will be around,
for a few more years, as well.


576
0:36:4,73 --> 0:36:7,92
Although may heaven help the engineer
that's got to oversee that refit.


577
0:36:7,92 --> 0:36:11,918
Refit?


578
0:36:11,918 --> 0:36:14,188
What makes you think she needs a refit?


579
0:36:14,188 --> 0:36:17,813
Thanks for your help. The Guardian
should retrieve us soon.


580
0:36:17,813 --> 0:36:34,518
- Good luck, Captain Kirk.
- The same, Captain Pike.


581
0:36:34,518 --> 0:36:35,713
Mr Kargh?


582
0:36:35,713 --> 0:36:38,63
I have no explanation, Captain.


583
0:36:38,63 --> 0:36:41,253
All indications are that by
correcting the time-line,


584
0:36:41,253 --> 0:36:43,508
we should be returned to our own history.


585
0:36:43,508 --> 0:36:45,461
It seems Mr Kargh miscalculated.


586
0:36:45,461 --> 0:36:48,466
The planet-killer moved ahead
in time by only a few years.


587
0:36:48,466 --> 0:36:49,104
How few?


588
0:36:49,104 --> 0:36:50,909
- Uncertain.
- We will have to go after it.


589
0:36:50,909 --> 0:36:52,903
Request permission to return to duty.


590
0:36:52,903 --> 0:36:55,81
Granted, Lieutenant.
Assume your station.


591
0:36:55,81 --> 0:36:58,711
Mr Kargh, feed your time calculations
to the navigation console.


592
0:36:58,711 --> 0:37:0,882
- Rand - you have to follow it.
- Sir?


593
0:37:0,882 --> 0:37:2,495
It gives off time ripples.


594
0:37:2,495 --> 0:37:5,352
You and DeSalle will have to
track it by the flow of time.


595
0:37:5,352 --> 0:37:9,747
Flows, eddies, bent blades of grass.
Whatever it takes.


596
0:37:9,747 --> 0:37:12,312
- Yes, sir.
- Understood, Captain.


597
0:37:12,312 --> 0:37:13,307
Mr Kargh,


598
0:37:13,307 --> 0:37:16,594
Prepare their calculations
for a sling-shot effect.


599
0:37:16,594 --> 0:37:20,525
Hold on, Kirk. Our two ships together,
barely survived last time.


600
0:37:20,525 --> 0:37:22,336
The Enterprise will see this through.


601
0:37:22,336 --> 0:37:23,574
Out of the question, Chris.


602
0:37:23,574 --> 0:37:26,175
The Enterprise could never survive
the pounding of breakaway.


603
0:37:26,175 --> 0:37:29,191
Shall I alert Starfleet, Captain?


604
0:37:29,191 --> 0:37:30,408
No.


605
0:37:30,408 --> 0:37:33,207
Even telling that many people,
may contaminate the future.


606
0:37:33,207 --> 0:37:35,154
Just keep your eyes open for us.


607
0:37:35,154 --> 0:37:36,935
Kirk out!


608
0:37:36,935 --> 0:37:46,465
Helm, let's go.


609
0:37:46,465 --> 0:37:47,823
600 days to go...


610
0:37:47,823 --> 0:37:50,399
400,.. 300,.. Mr Rand.


611
0:37:50,399 --> 0:37:51,58
I see it.


612
0:37:51,58 --> 0:37:58,479
Adjusting course.


613
0:37:58,479 --> 0:38:0,848
Farragut, do you read?


614
0:38:0,848 --> 0:38:2,669
Farragut, do you read?


615
0:38:2,669 --> 0:38:4,323
We're still in the past.


616
0:38:4,323 --> 0:38:5,5
Farragut, do you read?


617
0:38:5,5 --> 0:38:6,443
Mr Kargh?


618
0:38:6,443 --> 0:38:8,69
Our time coordinates are correct, Captain.


619
0:38:8,69 --> 0:38:10,624
I think I can clear up the signal, sir.


620
0:38:10,624 --> 0:38:12,172
On screen, Lieutenant.


621
0:38:12,172 --> 0:38:14,241
Farragut, do you read?


622
0:38:14,241 --> 0:38:16,254
- Pike calling Farragut.
- Pike?


623
0:38:16,254 --> 0:38:19,385
Where's Enterprise?
How did you know where to find us?


624
0:38:19,385 --> 0:38:21,393
Find you? I wasn't even looking.


625
0:38:21,393 --> 0:38:24,757
It is possible the currents in time
we were followingâ€¦


626
0:38:24,757 --> 0:38:27,301
Also washed Pike up on the same shore.


627
0:38:27,301 --> 0:38:30,161
And the planet-killer is
less than 15 minutes behind us.


628
0:38:30,161 --> 0:38:32,268
I was afraid you were going
to say that, Mr Kargh.


629
0:38:32,268 --> 0:38:36,137
Kirk, I've got a J-class full of
green cadets on a training mission.


630
0:38:36,137 --> 0:38:37,908
A J-class vessel may not
have enough power...


631
0:38:37,908 --> 0:38:39,925
That's why you are headed
for the hangar deck, Mr Kargh.


632
0:38:39,925 --> 0:38:44,144
I want you to find out how many shuttlecraft
and how much anti-matter, we can spare.


633
0:38:44,144 --> 0:38:45,594
- Mr Scott.
- Aye, sir.


634
0:38:45,594 --> 0:38:49,204
Take the mains offline and ramp them
up 25 points past the red line.


635
0:38:49,204 --> 0:38:52,171
I don't want that thing to have any
trouble finding us at the supper table.


636
0:38:52,171 --> 0:38:55,74
Now on your way.


637
0:38:55,74 --> 0:39:1,285
Fleet Captain, shall we make sure our
guest receives the appropriate welcome?


638
0:39:1,285 --> 0:39:11,541
Your place or mine?


639
0:39:11,541 --> 0:39:13,36
Scott to Bridge.


640
0:39:13,36 --> 0:39:15,946
It's time to ring the dinner bell.


641
0:39:15,946 --> 0:39:18,49
Alright, beasty.


642
0:39:18,49 --> 0:40:9,794
Come and get it!


643
0:40:9,794 --> 0:40:16,82
Stand-by, DeSalle.


644
0:40:16,82 --> 0:40:18,893
The Doomsday machine is coming in range.


645
0:40:18,893 --> 0:40:31,107
- That's your cue, Mr DeSalle.
- Aye, sir.


646
0:40:31,107 --> 0:40:32,528
Five,


647
0:40:32,528 --> 0:40:33,832
Four,


648
0:40:33,832 --> 0:40:35,283
Three,


649
0:40:35,283 --> 0:40:36,573
Two,


650
0:40:36,573 --> 0:40:38,272
One,


651
0:40:38,272 --> 0:40:43,41
Zero.


652
0:40:43,41 --> 0:40:43,961
Sir,


653
0:40:43,961 --> 0:40:45,728
I am getting massive anti-proton readings.


654
0:40:45,728 --> 0:40:49,582
On screen.


655
0:40:49,582 --> 0:40:58,425
Shields. Full reverse.
Get us out of here.


656
0:40:58,425 --> 0:40:59,704
Life support's gone!


657
0:40:59,704 --> 0:41:1,916
Main power failure.
Switching to auxiliary.


658
0:41:1,916 --> 0:41:4,519
Auxiliary will not be enough for
the deflector charge, Captain.


659
0:41:4,519 --> 0:41:5,635
We need more power.


660
0:41:5,635 --> 0:41:8,331
More direct power!


661
0:41:8,331 --> 0:41:9,997
Captain, that heading will take us right...


662
0:41:9,997 --> 0:41:18,0
Right into the belly of that beast.


663
0:41:18,0 --> 0:41:20,818
Kirk, what the blazes are you doing?


664
0:41:20,818 --> 0:41:23,604
Saving the future.


665
0:41:23,604 --> 0:41:27,774
Not alone.


666
0:41:27,774 --> 0:41:29,22
Computer, this is captain.


667
0:41:29,22 --> 0:41:31,674
- Destruct sequence! Code One...
- Captain, I'm getting new readings.


668
0:41:31,674 --> 0:41:42,785
From where?


669
0:41:42,785 --> 0:41:45,12
This is Admiral Kirk.
Get out of there, NOW!


670
0:41:45,12 --> 0:41:59,1
Do it, helm, full thrusters.


671
0:41:59,1 --> 0:42:1,89
It's not dead, just knocked out for a while.


672
0:42:1,89 --> 0:42:2,2
Then let's finish it!


673
0:42:2,2 --> 0:42:5,197
The anti-proton charge will only overload
when the machine is operating.


674
0:42:5,197 --> 0:42:9,123
He's right. The chance will come soon enough.
I suggest you begin your repairs.


675
0:42:9,123 --> 0:42:11,834
I'm getting pretty damn tired of this!


676
0:42:11,834 --> 0:42:15,26
Is time travel just something
you guys do in the future?


677
0:42:15,26 --> 0:42:17,506
Chris, it's good to see you on your feet.


678
0:42:17,506 --> 0:42:21,611
I'm guessing that you're
from the future, Admiral?


679
0:42:21,611 --> 0:42:23,599
That is a logical assumption.


680
0:42:23,599 --> 0:42:26,1
2373 to be precise.


681
0:42:26,1 --> 0:42:30,692
You both look, remarkably well.


682
0:42:30,692 --> 0:42:34,665
Ambassador Spock and I have been
through death and life together.


683
0:42:34,665 --> 0:42:38,531
That is an understatement.


684
0:42:38,531 --> 0:42:42,39
Admiral, I assume your
appearance here is no accident.


685
0:42:42,39 --> 0:42:43,58
No.


686
0:42:43,58 --> 0:42:46,519
In our time-line, the destruction of the
Farragut was insufficient,


687
0:42:46,519 --> 0:42:47,88
to stop the planet killer.


688
0:42:47,88 --> 0:42:50,895
We pulled every ship out of mothballs
to fight those things.


689
0:42:50,895 --> 0:42:55,767
Science, of the 24th Century, is sufficiently
advanced to destroy a doomsday-machine.


690
0:42:55,767 --> 0:42:58,262
Without sacrificing a starship or her crew.


691
0:42:58,262 --> 0:43:2,357
And if we can stop this one,
this war will never occur.


692
0:43:2,357 --> 0:43:5,408
But we have to get it from our time to yours.


693
0:43:5,408 --> 0:43:7,927
- It's as simple as that.
- Captain Pike


694
0:43:7,927 --> 0:43:11,95
I am reading high levels of delta-
radiation aboard your vessel.


695
0:43:11,95 --> 0:43:14,721
The baffle plating around our
reactor took the worst beating.


696
0:43:14,721 --> 0:43:20,878
We're making repairs. Pike out.


697
0:43:20,878 --> 0:43:23,278
Admiral?


698
0:43:23,278 --> 0:43:25,805
They don't say goodbye in the future?


699
0:43:25,805 --> 0:43:29,901
No, more than that, he knows something.


700
0:43:29,901 --> 0:43:31,85
Let's see your readings from the Guardian.


701
0:43:31,85 --> 0:43:34,513
Captain?


702
0:43:34,513 --> 0:43:36,867
There it is.


703
0:43:36,867 --> 0:43:41,298
Farragut to Kirk. Admiral, I know
what you and Spock are trying to do.


704
0:43:41,298 --> 0:43:42,877
You can't do this.


705
0:43:42,877 --> 0:43:45,108
Things have to follow their natural course.


706
0:43:45,108 --> 0:43:48,536
It's not the natural course,
if it's because that thing attacked.


707
0:43:48,536 --> 0:43:50,225
Isn't that what we are trying to do, here?


708
0:43:50,225 --> 0:43:52,722
making right what the doomsday
machine put wrong?


709
0:43:52,722 --> 0:43:54,913
But this isn't wrong.


710
0:43:54,913 --> 0:43:57,339
Chris Pike's accident is part of your history.


711
0:43:57,339 --> 0:43:58,774
It should be part of mine.


712
0:43:58,774 --> 0:44:0,295
Not this time


713
0:44:0,295 --> 0:44:2,498
Admiral, there's got to be another way.


714
0:44:2,498 --> 0:44:6,666
Captain, believe me when I say,
this is the better way.


715
0:44:6,666 --> 0:44:9,281
The Enterprise transporters
have been activated.


716
0:44:9,281 --> 0:44:11,38
Someone just beamed aboard the Daedalus.


717
0:44:11,38 --> 0:44:12,253
Admiral.


718
0:44:12,253 --> 0:44:15,73
- Kirk!
- He's stopped transmitting, sir.


719
0:44:15,73 --> 0:44:17,684
Open that door and you will flood
this ship with delta radiation.


720
0:44:17,684 --> 0:44:19,853
Not if we seal this room and recirculate the air.


721
0:44:19,853 --> 0:44:22,333
Captain. Chris, you cannot.


722
0:44:22,333 --> 0:44:30,682
Maybe you're right.


723
0:44:30,682 --> 0:44:40,739
They'll die if we don't get them out.


724
0:44:40,739 --> 0:44:45,699
Chris!


725
0:44:45,699 --> 0:44:51,22
Chris!


726
0:44:51,22 --> 0:44:55,796
Ambassador, you are needed
back aboard the Enterprise.


727
0:44:55,796 --> 0:45:2,322
Captain, Enterprise has
reactivated her transporter.


728
0:45:2,322 --> 0:45:3,584
Status report, Mr Scott.


729
0:45:3,584 --> 0:45:5,624
- Everything's ready, Captain.
- Well done, Scotty.


730
0:45:5,624 --> 0:45:7,734
- Kargh, contact both ships.
- Yes, sir.


731
0:45:7,734 --> 0:45:10,307
We have played tag with
doomsday long enough.


732
0:45:10,307 --> 0:45:21,151
It's time we finished this.


733
0:45:21,151 --> 0:45:26,719
Readings off the scale.


734
0:45:26,719 --> 0:45:30,3
Anti-proton energy was at
sufficient levels, Captain.


735
0:45:30,3 --> 0:45:32,29
It has gone back where it came from.


736
0:45:32,29 --> 0:45:34,772
Well done, Admiral, well done!


737
0:45:34,772 --> 0:45:35,973
Captain,


738
0:45:35,973 --> 0:45:40,968
I am getting dangerously high readings
of delta radiation, from the cadet vessel.


739
0:45:40,968 --> 0:45:44,15
Located near the aft reactor room.


740
0:45:44,15 --> 0:45:49,67
No fatalities as best as I can tell.


741
0:45:49,67 --> 0:45:52,134
Fleet Captain Pike has suffered
severe radiation poisoning.


742
0:45:52,134 --> 0:45:57,197
The Daedalus will make it to Starbase 11,
where he will receive the best medical attention.


743
0:45:57,197 --> 0:45:58,99
I wish we could have done more.


744
0:45:58,99 --> 0:46:0,804
We will, Captain.


745
0:46:0,804 --> 0:46:1,857
We will.


746
0:46:1,857 --> 0:46:4,344
It's only a matter of time.


747
0:46:4,344 --> 0:46:5,663
Oh, Jim


748
0:46:5,663 --> 0:46:7,539
Contact Carol.


749
0:46:7,539 --> 0:46:40,697
It's a boy.


750
0:46:40,697 --> 0:46:48,34
[Tanoy] Dr Donovan, please report to
astrophysics lab...


751
0:46:48,34 --> 0:46:54,504
[Two beeps = No]


752
0:46:54,504 --> 0:46:56,82
Do not despair.


753
0:46:56,82 --> 0:46:58,522
There are alternatives.


754
0:46:58,522 --> 0:47:1,26
The Spock, you know will soon arrive.


755
0:47:1,26 --> 0:47:4,229
His plan will work, Captain.


756
0:47:4,229 --> 0:47:7,217
It is a foregone certainty.


757
0:47:7,217 --> 0:47:9,286
But I must know it is what you want.


758
0:47:9,286 --> 0:47:11,77
[Two beeps = No]


759
0:47:11,77 --> 0:47:18,52
Captain, do you remember what Dr Boyce
often said about living one's life to the fullest?


760
0:47:18,52 --> 0:47:21,48
One lives life as it happens.


761
0:47:21,48 --> 0:47:23,52
Meeting it head on,


762
0:47:23,52 --> 0:47:26,754
or turning his back on it and withering away.


763
0:47:26,754 --> 0:47:30,288
Do not choose to wither away.


764
0:47:30,288 --> 0:47:37,402
Live long and prosper.


765
0:47:37,402 --> 0:47:42,297
Energize.


766
0:47:42,297 --> 0:47:45,509
[One beep = Yes]


767
0:47:45,509 --> 0:47:47,42
Captain Pike?


768
0:47:47,42 --> 0:47:50,206
Captain Pike?


769
0:47:50,206 --> 0:48:22,611
You remember these Gentlemen?
They wanted to visit you.


770
0:48:22,611 --> 0:48:35,35
Spock to Enterprise.
One to beam-up.


771
0:48:35,35 --> 0:48:43,394
[Gateway] Time has resumed its shape.
All is as it was before.


772
0:48:43,394 --> 0:48:45,973
Many such journeys are possible.


773
0:48:45,973 --> 0:49:6,945
Let me be your Gateway.


774
0:49:6,945 --> 0:50:4,435
