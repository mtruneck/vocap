CHRIS GARVER: I know a lot of
people are like, oh, I'd love


30
0:2:21,23 --> 0:2:23,17
to go work at Three Tides.


31
0:2:23,17 --> 0:2:25,3
They're are a world
famous shop.


32
0:2:25,3 --> 0:2:26,88
It's got great artists.


33
0:2:26,88 --> 0:2:28,97
It's going to go down in
history as one of those


34
0:2:28,97 --> 0:2:32,1
legendary shops.


35
0:2:32,1 --> 0:2:35,86
I tattooed at Three Tides
several times.


36
0:2:35,86 --> 0:2:39,62
I went out there for the first
time with Juan Puente after


37
0:2:39,62 --> 0:2:44,37
they had that 1999 first tattoo
convention in Tokyo.


38
0:2:44,37 --> 0:2:47,67
The first Tokyo convention in
1999, that was a pretty


39
0:2:47,67 --> 0:2:50,3
groundbreaking thing, especially
for Japan.


40
0:2:50,3 --> 0:2:53,15
Because in Japan tattooing
is not as open.


41
0:2:53,15 --> 0:2:54,93
There wasn't, at that
time, too much


42
0:2:54,93 --> 0:2:57,1
communication between artists.


43
0:2:57,1 --> 0:2:58,78
[INAUDIBLE] it was known that
there was going to be a really


44
0:2:58,78 --> 0:3:0,43
big International convention
there.


45
0:3:0,43 --> 0:3:3,36
That was a really big move.


46
0:3:3,36 --> 0:3:7,8
When so many foreigners came
over to Japan, and a lot of


47
0:3:7,8 --> 0:3:8,1
people wanted to stay.


48
0:3:8,1 --> 0:3:11,56
So a lot of the tattooers
were invited to work


49
0:3:11,56 --> 0:3:13,7
at different shops.


50
0:3:13,7 --> 0:3:16,2
And I got invited to work
at Three Tides.


51
0:3:16,2 --> 0:3:19,9



52
0:3:19,9 --> 0:3:22,37
When I went there the first
time, it was Horitomo.


53
0:3:22,37 --> 0:3:23,53
He was Washo then.


54
0:3:23,53 --> 0:3:25,73
Mutsuo was an apprentice.


55
0:3:25,73 --> 0:3:28,14
He hadn't started
tattooing yet.


56
0:3:28,14 --> 0:3:33,17
I had tattooed Washo in
1991 in Philadelphia.


57
0:3:33,17 --> 0:3:34,82
He didn't speak any
English yet.


58
0:3:34,82 --> 0:3:36,99
He came up to me and he asked
me if I would tattoo


59
0:3:36,99 --> 0:3:38,55
a monster on him.


60
0:3:38,55 --> 0:3:42,52
And that was basically the
only thing he could say.


61
0:3:42,52 --> 0:3:43,82
He's a mind blowing artist.


62
0:3:43,82 --> 0:3:44,82
He's one of my favorites.


63
0:3:44,82 --> 0:3:48,58
I think he's probably one of
the best in the world.


64
0:3:48,58 --> 0:3:50,67
Mossa, he doesn't tattoo.


65
0:3:50,67 --> 0:3:56,62
But he is really good
at running a shop.


66
0:3:56,62 --> 0:3:59,18
It's a little bit strange for
a tattoo artist to work at a


67
0:3:59,18 --> 0:4:1,73
shop where the owner isn't
a tattoo artist.


68
0:4:1,73 --> 0:4:4,23
But I think in Three Tides
it really works.


69
0:4:4,23 --> 0:4:5,85
He loves tattooing.


70
0:4:5,85 --> 0:4:8,47
And I think he wanted
to elevate the art.


71
0:4:8,47 --> 0:4:12,51



72
0:4:12,51 --> 0:4:15,2
Three Tides was one of
the first Western


73
0:4:15,2 --> 0:4:17,529
style shop in Osaka.


74
0:4:17,529 --> 0:4:18,99
It wasn't a street level shop.


75
0:4:18,99 --> 0:4:21,709
It had like a little sign,
and it was in an alley.


76
0:4:21,709 --> 0:4:26,3
So was about as out in
the open a shop has


77

there was quite a few foreign


91
0:8:12,52 --> 0:8:13,2
artists that went there.


92
0:8:13,2 --> 0:8:16,9
I know Running Bear went
there, Charlie Roberts.


93
0:8:16,9 --> 0:8:18,84
Well they learned firsthand how
American tattooers act.


94
0:8:18,84 --> 0:8:21,64
They had so many coming out.


95
0:8:21,64 --> 0:8:22,29
I had a great time.


96
0:8:22,29 --> 0:8:25,28
All those guys at Three Tides
are super cool dudes.


97
0:8:25,28 --> 0:8:27,14
And used to make
them get drunk.


98
0:8:27,14 --> 0:8:28,39

99
0:8:28,39 --> 0:8:31,7



100

When I was at Three Tides, I was
drinking more alcohol than


101
0:8:35,64 --> 0:8:37,3
I ever have in my life.


102
0:8:37,3 --> 0:8:40,929
And I was probably getting
really crazy and belligerent.


103
0:8:40,929 --> 0:8:42,2
Mutsuo always took it so good.


104
0:8:42,2 --> 0:8:45,265
No matter how much I was like,
get him in a headlock and give


105
0:8:45,265 --> 0:8:47,55
him nuggies and stuff,
he would always be


106
0:8:47,55 --> 0:8:48,32
cool the next day.


107
0:8:48,32 --> 0:8:51,13
He would never be like, Garver,
you're an asshole.


108
0:8:51,13 --> 0:8:54,87
I think Mutsuo, he's just like
a super nice dude, you know.


109
0:8:54,87 --> 0:8:55,6
He's quiet.


110
0:8:55,6 --> 0:8:57,2
He's driven.


111
0:8:57,2 --> 0:8:59,7
I think that's one of the things
I admire about him.


112
0:8:59,7 --> 0:9:0,88
He's just persistent.


113
0:9:0,88 --> 0:9:3,97
When he started off, he wasn't
great at drawing.


114
0:9:3,97 --> 0:9:6,83
But whenever somebody wasn't
telling him to clean this,


115
0:9:6,83 --> 0:9:11,38
break that down, he would
be drawing all day long.


116
0:9:11,38 --> 0:9:14,57
He didn't really ask
for anything.


117
0:9:14,57 --> 0:9:17,89
But I think everybody willingly
would critique his--


118
0:9:17,89 --> 0:9:20,56
people, everybody critiqued
his stuff.


119
0:9:20,56 --> 0:9:23,58
The way he came across, the way
he was, it made you want


120
0:9:23,58 --> 0:9:24,62
to help him.


121
0:9:24,62 --> 0:9:26,37
You could tell that
he was going to be


122
0:9:26,37 --> 0:9:27,8
a good tattoo artist.

0:9:27,8 --> 0:9:30,57
He wasn't going to give up.


124
0:9:30,57 --> 0:9:32,34
By the time I left he
started tattooing.


125
0:9:32,34 --> 0:9:34,29
And he picked it up so fast.

130
0:10:2,305 --> 0:10:5,3

131

He would put so much of his
energy into every piece.


132
0:10:9,6 --> 0:10:12,51
There would be a million
outlines.


133
0:10:12,51 --> 0:10:15,82
The shop didn't open until noon,
but he would go in and


134
0:10:15,82 --> 0:10:17,67
open up at--


135
0:10:17,67 --> 0:10:19,15
he would go in there
at 9 o'clock.


136
0:10:19,15 --> 0:10:21,32
I think Mutsuo had to
go and let him in.


137
0:10:21,32 --> 0:10:25,7
He was a huge influence
on Mutsuo.


138
0:10:25,7 --> 0:10:28,426
He definitely put a lot

I think Mutsuo--

0:10:35,87 --> 0:10:40,16
I don't even know if at the time
he realized that he was

stuck it out.
