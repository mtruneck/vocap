0:0:7,6 --> 0:0:8,24
Hey, I'm Hanson O'Haver.


4
0:0:8,24 --> 0:0:10,76
Welcome to this week on Drake,
Vice's look at what Drake's


5
0:0:10,76 --> 0:0:12,24
been up to lately.


6
0:0:12,24 --> 0:0:13,83
So there are really
two big pieces of


7
0:0:13,83 --> 0:0:14,89
Drake news this week.


8
0:0:14,89 --> 0:0:18,1
The first is that he announced
a tour that's sort of like


9
0:0:18,1 --> 0:0:20,46
monsters of blog rap tour.


10
0:0:20,46 --> 0:0:26,56
It's with 2 Chainz, formerly
Tity Boi, J Cole, Waka Flocka,


11
0:0:26,56 --> 0:0:28,84
and the geographically
confoundingly


12
0:0:28,84 --> 0:0:32,3
named French Montana.


13
0:0:32,3 --> 0:0:34,7
Personally, I'm not really a big
fan of concerts, because I


14
0:0:34,7 --> 0:0:38,17
think all the best Drake songs
are kind of sad, like about


15
0:0:38,17 --> 0:0:39,42
being lonely.


16
0:0:39,42 --> 0:0:43,4
I think it's sort of weird to be
with 2,000 people in a room


17
0:0:43,4 --> 0:0:45,3
feeling alienated.


18
0:0:45,3 --> 0:0:48,4
The other piece of news, he
was in Miami alongside of


19
0:0:48,4 --> 0:0:52,29
Birdman, Lil' Wayne, and DJ
Khaled filming a video for


20
0:0:52,29 --> 0:0:57,16
"HYFR." Personally, I think that
"HYFR" is probably one of


21
0:0:57,16 --> 0:1:0,43
the worst songs on Take Care,
just because the chorus of


22
0:1:0,43 --> 0:1:2,21
"Hell yeah, fucking right"
is really dumb.


23
0:1:2,21 --> 0:1:5,379
Like, to just repeat that over
and over doesn't really do


24
0:1:5,379 --> 0:1:6,28
much for me.


25
0:1:6,28 --> 0:1:9,13
And also because in the song,
Drake and Lil' Wayne talk


26
0:1:9,13 --> 0:1:12,17
about fucking the same girls,
and it's kind of weird.


27
0:1:12,17 --> 0:1:15,99
Like, I just think Lil'
Wayne's sort of gross.


28
0:1:15,99 --> 0:1:19,23
But to be fair to Wayne, I knew
this girl in high school


29
0:1:19,23 --> 0:1:23,49
that moved to LA, and I heard
that she sucked his dick, and


30
0:1:23,49 --> 0:1:24,74
nothing bad happened to her.


31
0:1:24,74 --> 0:1:25,98
Like, she's fine
and everything.


32
0:1:25,98 --> 0:1:30,95
So if Drake's cool with that,
more power to Drake.


33
0:1:30,95 --> 0:1:32,58
But anyways, the video's
supposed to


34
0:1:32,58 --> 0:1:33,89
be Bar Mitzvah themed.


35
0:1:33,89 --> 0:1:37,6
I never got a chance to go to a
Bar Mitzvah, so I hope that


36
0:1:37,6 --> 0:1:39,97
the video will kind of show
me what that's all about.


37
0:1:39,97 --> 0:1:41,22
Take care.


38
0:1:41,22 --> 0:3:41,22
