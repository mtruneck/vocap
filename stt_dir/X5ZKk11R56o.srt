1
0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:30,12



2
0:0:30,12 --> 0:0:31,42
THOMAS MORTON: So we're just
on the outskirts of


3
0:0:31,42 --> 0:0:32,716
the gyre right now.


4
0:0:32,716 --> 0:0:34,575
We haven't really even gotten
into the thick of things, and


5
0:0:34,575 --> 0:0:37,1
already in the last hour, we've
seen more fucking trash


6
0:0:37,1 --> 0:0:41,582
float by than we have in the
entire voyage up until now.


7
0:0:41,582 --> 0:0:44,57
The past day I started getting
this weird fear that, like,


8
0:0:44,57 --> 0:0:45,76
what if the garbage
patch isn't here?


9
0:0:45,76 --> 0:0:47,34
What if we'd all been duped?


10
0:0:47,34 --> 0:0:47,97
But I don't--


11
0:0:47,97 --> 0:0:50,77
I don't see that as being
the case anymore.


12
0:0:50,77 --> 0:0:54,928
We're staring to see a
lot of gnarly shit.


13
0:0:54,928 --> 0:0:55,9
Dude!


14
0:0:55,9 --> 0:0:57,596
Are these-- are you
seeing this shit?


15
0:0:57,596 --> 0:1:0,24
Like, some of it-- some of it's,
uh, what's it, bubbles


16
0:1:0,24 --> 0:1:1,155
and what have you?


17
0:1:1,155 --> 0:1:2,97
But if you look in the middle
of them, there's, like,


18
0:1:2,97 --> 0:1:4,94
fucking chunks of crap.


19
0:1:4,94 --> 0:1:6,68
I'll get under your net,
and we'll get it.


20
0:1:6,68 --> 0:1:7,7
Ready?


21
0:1:7,7 --> 0:1:8,67
Here it comes.


22
0:1:8,67 --> 0:1:10,125
MALE SPEAKER: You got it?


23
0:1:10,125 --> 0:1:11,13
THOMAS MORTON: I got it.


24
0:1:11,13 --> 0:1:12,42
There we go.


25
0:1:12,42 --> 0:1:14,27
Ah, yeah.


26
0:1:14,27 --> 0:1:15,56
MALE SPEAKER: Teamwork.


27
0:1:15,56 --> 0:1:17,51
THOMAS MORTON: Look
at that thing.


28
0:1:17,51 --> 0:1:19,506
MEREDITH DANLUCK:
Where's it from?


29
0:1:19,506 --> 0:1:21,47
MALE SPEAKER: Looks
like Japan.


30
0:1:21,47 --> 0:1:23,276
THOMAS MORTON: It's Japan.


31
0:1:23,276 --> 0:1:26,3
This is either the second or
third buoy we've pulled with


32
0:1:26,3 --> 0:1:27,61
Japanese shit on it.


33
0:1:27,61 --> 0:1:30,33
We are across the Pacific
from Japan.


34
0:1:30,33 --> 0:1:33,43
By the time it gets here, it
has to make a three- to


35
0:1:33,43 --> 0:1:37,92
five-year circle around the gyre
all the way over towards


36
0:1:37,92 --> 0:1:41,38
Asia, up by Alaska,
and then back in.


37
0:1:41,38 --> 0:1:44,8
The whole thing-- the whole
thing's kind of just one big


38
0:1:44,8 --> 0:1:46,78
unfathomable bummer.


39
0:1:46,78 --> 0:1:50,13
I came out here expecting to
see, like, a trash dump,


40
0:1:50,13 --> 0:1:52,27
pieces in the water that
you could pull out.


41
0:1:52,27 --> 0:1:56,12
But instead, what I got was
an even ruder awakening.


42
0:1:56,12 --> 0:1:57,82
Looking out right now, you
don't see the garbage.


43
0:1:57,82 --> 0:1:59,82
Sometimes you see
shit float by.


44
0:1:59,82 --> 0:2:1,21
Most the time you don't.


45
0:2:1,21 --> 0:2:2,6
You just see water.


46
0:2:2,6 --> 0:2:5,87
But what's in that water is a
fucking thousand times worse


47
0:2:5,87 --> 0:2:7,1
than a Coke bottle.


48
0:2:7,1 --> 0:2:10,979
Because what it is, it's every
part of a Coke bottle busted


49
0:2:10,979 --> 0:2:13,872
down into a little digestible
morsel.


50
0:2:13,872 --> 0:2:15,903
CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE: No, we
don't have it over the eye


51
0:2:15,903 --> 0:2:16,725
hook right.


52
0:2:16,725 --> 0:2:20,18
I'm [INAUDIBLE] right
now with my line.


53
0:2:20,18 --> 0:2:21,58
THOMAS MORTON: This is where
we're going to dump this


54
0:2:21,58 --> 0:2:24,61
little winged thing
out the back.


55
0:2:24,61 --> 0:2:27,34
So we just sit now and let that
thing, uh, fucking Hoover


56
0:2:27,34 --> 0:2:30,515
up all the crap that's on the
surface of the water.


57
0:2:30,515 --> 0:2:31,8
And then we'll draw it in.


58
0:2:31,8 --> 0:2:34,4
And I kind of don't know where
we're going from there.


59
0:2:34,4 --> 0:2:36,56
Look at it, be grossed out.


60
0:2:36,56 --> 0:2:39,472



61
0:2:39,472 --> 0:2:41,424
CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE:
Ready, you ready?


62
0:2:41,424 --> 0:2:47,768
Seven, four, eight, six.


63
0:2:47,768 --> 0:2:54,6



64
0:2:54,6 --> 0:2:57,7
This is actually a very sad
sample, because this is what


65
0:2:57,7 --> 0:3:0,6
we're talking about with
the 60 to 1 bit


66
0:3:0,6 --> 0:3:1,64
instead of the 6 to 1.


67
0:3:1,64 --> 0:3:3,99
THOMAS MORTON: A bad ratio of
plastic to sea life is--


68
0:3:3,99 --> 0:3:7,1
what's it, 6 to 1 in a sample?


69
0:3:7,1 --> 0:3:10,64
CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE:
This is 60 to 1.


70
0:3:10,64 --> 0:3:13,27
This sample has very
little life in it.


71
0:3:13,27 --> 0:3:16,37
There's all the components
of the plastic soup


72
0:3:16,37 --> 0:3:18,62
that the ocean is.


73
0:3:18,62 --> 0:3:20,81
THOMAS MORTON: This is, like,
levels beyond pollution.


74
0:3:20,81 --> 0:3:26,79
We've changed, like, the
composition of ocean water


75
0:3:26,79 --> 0:3:30,358
almost 1,000 miles from
fucking shore.


76
0:3:30,358 --> 0:3:50,32



77
0:3:50,32 --> 0:3:53,72
CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE: Here's
one part of an organism, it


78
0:3:53,72 --> 0:3:54,69
looks like.


79
0:3:54,69 --> 0:3:57,64
So we have a lot of
microplastics here.


80
0:3:57,64 --> 0:4:1,2
And you notice there's no reds
in here, no oranges.


81
0:4:1,2 --> 0:4:2,195
THOMAS MORTON: Why's that?


82
0:4:2,195 --> 0:4:5,155
CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE: That's
because these fish like to eat


83
0:4:5,155 --> 0:4:8,61
things that are red and orange,
that look like shrimp.


84
0:4:8,61 --> 0:4:9,99
And birds eat them too.


85
0:4:9,99 --> 0:4:11,4
THOMAS MORTON: After an hour,
the only thing we


86
0:4:11,4 --> 0:4:11,91
got were two bugs.


87
0:4:11,91 --> 0:4:13,69
CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE: I don't
think we would have seen any


88
0:4:13,69 --> 0:4:15,62
of these floating by.


89
0:4:15,62 --> 0:4:16,529
THOMAS MORTON: Yeah, no.


90
0:4:16,529 --> 0:4:18,769
MEREDITH DANLUCK: When you
describe this place as, like,


91
0:4:18,769 --> 0:4:21,92
a collection of garbage the size
of Texas, it's really,


92
0:4:21,92 --> 0:4:26,1
really about, like, that you can
trawl this entire area and


93
0:4:26,1 --> 0:4:27,77
still find little
bits of plastic.


94
0:4:27,77 --> 0:4:29,4
CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE: Yeah,
and then there's these


95
0:4:29,4 --> 0:4:32,18
accumulation zones, which
are poorly defined.


96
0:4:32,18 --> 0:4:35,24
Like Ebbesmeyer says size of
Texas or twice the size of


97
0:4:35,24 --> 0:4:36,96
Texas or something like this.


98
0:4:36,96 --> 0:4:41,16
Well, that state of
Texas is moving.


99
0:4:41,16 --> 0:4:41,86
It's all--


100
0:4:41,86 --> 0:4:44,57
there's no answer
book, you know?


101
0:4:44,57 --> 0:4:46,47
We're writing the answer book.


102
0:4:46,47 --> 0:4:51,656
So we don't-- we don't really
know any answers.


103
0:4:51,656 --> 0:4:54,334
OK, 10, 12--


104
0:4:54,334 --> 0:5:2,3
12 more minutes.


105
0:5:2,3 --> 0:5:4,42
THOMAS MORTON: God,
this is awful.


106
0:5:4,42 --> 0:5:8,46
This looks like you'd find this
in a stagnant place at,


107
0:5:8,46 --> 0:5:11,41
like, a really busy
harbor, not in the


108
0:5:11,41 --> 0:5:12,875
middle of the ocean.


109
0:5:12,875 --> 0:5:16,1
CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE: We have
everything in here in terms of


110
0:5:16,1 --> 0:5:21,58
plastic-- net, nurdles,
Styrofoam, bottle caps.


111
0:5:21,58 --> 0:5:23,11
THOMAS MORTON: This is our
first introduction to the


112
0:5:23,11 --> 0:5:28,26
garbage patch, a product of
a little hour's trawling.


113
0:5:28,26 --> 0:5:30,58
This is really a synthetic
environment.


114
0:5:30,58 --> 0:5:32,76
And where we're going,
we're going to see


115
0:5:32,76 --> 0:5:33,98
it get a lot worse.


116
0:5:33,98 --> 0:5:35,85
It's kind of disheartening.


117
0:5:35,85 --> 0:5:39,37
I mean, how do you fucking pull
the plastic out of that?


118
0:5:39,37 --> 0:5:41,525
CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE: That's
why I'm so glad that you guys


119
0:5:41,525 --> 0:5:45,184
came, because I think seeing
this changes people's


120
0:5:45,184 --> 0:5:50,304
perception of how serious
the problem is.


121
0:5:50,304 --> 0:5:52,506
MEREDITH DANLUCK: I mean
we are so far away.


122
0:5:52,506 --> 0:5:54,51
CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE: Yeah, I
mean, you had to get here--


123
0:5:54,51 --> 0:5:57,199
you had to spend the time
getting here to realize how


124
0:5:57,199 --> 0:5:58,449
far you were.


125
0:5:58,449 --> 0:6:1,356



126
0:6:1,356 --> 0:6:2,823
MEREDITH DANLUCK: I'm
totally bummed.


127
0:6:2,823 --> 0:6:9,18



128
0:6:9,18 --> 0:6:12,61
I don't know if I'm
just tired.


129
0:6:12,61 --> 0:6:15,94
And it's also different to have
seen, like, pictures--


130
0:6:15,94 --> 0:6:20,44
like a picture of a jar
somewhere in some magazine,


131
0:6:20,44 --> 0:6:23,16
and then to, like, realize
how long it's taken


132
0:6:23,16 --> 0:6:24,205
for us to get here.


133
0:6:24,205 --> 0:6:29,27
I mean, we are in the
middle of nowhere.


134
0:6:29,27 --> 0:6:32,39
Like, I think there are
so few people who have


135
0:6:32,39 --> 0:6:33,81
actually been here.


136
0:6:33,81 --> 0:6:36,88
Maybe no one has ever
been in this spot.


137
0:6:36,88 --> 0:6:37,32
You know?


138
0:6:37,32 --> 0:6:40,32
It's that kind of, like,
real middle of nowhere.


139
0:6:40,32 --> 0:6:45,3
And it's filled with
our trash.


140
0:6:45,3 --> 0:6:47,3
You know?


141
0:6:47,3 --> 0:6:48,53
We've really screwed up.


142
0:6:48,53 --> 0:6:50,3
We're all going to hell.


143
0:6:50,3 --> 0:7:33,34



144
0:7:33,34 --> 0:7:35,59
DR. LORENA MENDOZA: I think the
plastic is everywhere, in


145
0:7:35,59 --> 0:7:36,51
all the world.


146
0:7:36,51 --> 0:7:36,931
THOMAS MORTON: It's
just uniform?


147
0:7:36,931 --> 0:7:39,4
DR. LORENA MENDOZA: Yes.


148
0:7:39,4 --> 0:7:41,49
I don't see anyplace
in the world that


149
0:7:41,49 --> 0:7:44,32
don't contain plastic.


150
0:7:44,32 --> 0:7:45,57
[SPEAKING SPANISH]


151
0:7:45,57 --> 0:8:9,64



152
0:8:9,64 --> 0:8:12,64
CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE: You and
I have seen shocking amounts


153
0:8:12,64 --> 0:8:13,71
of plastic in these samples.


154
0:8:13,71 --> 0:8:16,52
But what is there that
we can't see?


155
0:8:16,52 --> 0:8:20,63
Individual plastic polymer
molecules.


156
0:8:20,63 --> 0:8:24,65
And they're in the process
of breaking from a 2,000


157
0:8:24,65 --> 0:8:27,96
molecular weight chain down
to 1,000 in a totally


158
0:8:27,96 --> 0:8:29,825
uncontrolled experiment.


159
0:8:29,825 --> 0:8:30,755
MEREDITH DANLUCK: What's that?


160
0:8:30,755 --> 0:8:32,15
CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE:
[INAUDIBLE]


161
0:8:32,15 --> 0:8:35,659
MEREDITH DANLUCK: That's
fishing line?


162
0:8:35,659 --> 0:8:38,549
THOMAS MORTON: Once plastic's
broken down, because of their


163
0:8:38,549 --> 0:8:42,53
structure, they can act as
sponges for chemical compounds


164
0:8:42,53 --> 0:8:46,49
called Persistent Organic
Pollutants, which is an eerily


165
0:8:46,49 --> 0:8:52,18
cute term for horrible
chemicals, like DDT and


166
0:8:52,18 --> 0:8:56,61
pesticides, that are actually
pretty common in ocean water.


167
0:8:56,61 --> 0:8:59,73
But once plastic's introduced
into the mix, the plastic


168
0:8:59,73 --> 0:9:1,33
just, like, sops them up.


169
0:9:1,33 --> 0:9:7,36
It's, like, basted in
poisonous chemicals.


170
0:9:7,36 --> 0:9:9,264
MEREDITH DANLUCK: The worst
ever [INAUDIBLE] trawl.


171
0:9:9,264 --> 0:9:9,761
CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE: Yep.


172
0:9:9,761 --> 0:9:11,75
It's my worst ever.


173
0:9:11,75 --> 0:9:12,846
And the number of nurdles
is outstanding.


174
0:9:12,846 --> 0:9:13,946
THOMAS MORTON: That doesn't
even have the big


175
0:9:13,946 --> 0:9:14,83
piece in it, does it?


176
0:9:14,83 --> 0:9:15,16
CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE: No.


177
0:9:15,16 --> 0:9:17,8
This isn't even the
full sample.


178
0:9:17,8 --> 0:9:20,47
This is probably 1,000 to
1, plastic to plankton.


179
0:9:20,47 --> 0:9:24,65
Probably our first ever breaking
the 1,000 to 1 mark.


180
0:9:24,65 --> 0:9:27,486
Previous studies had only just
counted the plastic.


181
0:9:27,486 --> 0:9:31,69
But our breakthrough study
became a new kind of way to


182
0:9:31,69 --> 0:9:34,475
assess the problem as compared
to the available food.


183
0:9:34,475 --> 0:9:37,9
Ebbesmeyer says a one-liter
bottle will break into enough


184
0:9:37,9 --> 0:9:40,37
pieces to put one particle
on every mile of


185
0:9:40,37 --> 0:9:41,645
beach in the world.


186
0:9:41,645 --> 0:9:43,91
MEREDITH DANLUCK: You stil that
up, and it's virtually


187
0:9:43,91 --> 0:9:46,615
invisible, you know, this
confetti that's all in the


188
0:9:46,615 --> 0:9:47,553
ocean right now.


189
0:9:47,553 --> 0:9:50,64
CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE: I think
that's your challenge, is to


190
0:9:50,64 --> 0:9:54,136
create that immediacy for the
people that would only think


191
0:9:54,136 --> 0:9:55,329
of an object.


192
0:9:55,329 --> 0:9:57,24
How do you talk about that?


193
0:9:57,24 --> 0:9:59,6
Everybody said, why don't you
just go out and clean it up?


194
0:9:59,6 --> 0:10:2,13
You know, they think it's
like a parking lot.


195
0:10:2,13 --> 0:10:3,4
There's no way.


196
0:10:3,4 --> 0:10:4,74
There's no way you
can clean it up.


197
0:10:4,74 --> 0:10:5,78
No chance.


198
0:10:5,78 --> 0:10:9,37
I did a calculation that we'd
require every man, woman, and


199
0:10:9,37 --> 0:10:9,98
child on earth--


200
0:10:9,98 --> 0:10:12,2
6.6 billion--


201
0:10:12,2 --> 0:10:14,95
during their lifetime to clean
up the ocean, they would have


202
0:10:14,95 --> 0:10:18,181
to be in charge of 100,000
pick-up truckloads of ocean.


203
0:10:18,181 --> 0:10:21,43



204
0:10:21,43 --> 0:10:25,43
THOMAS MORTON: This is
beyond bad news.


205
0:10:25,43 --> 0:10:29,47
What do you fucking do against
this, Have countries sign


206
0:10:29,47 --> 0:10:30,21
agreements?


207
0:10:30,21 --> 0:10:34,16
There's no-- there's no policing
the waters out here.


208
0:10:34,16 --> 0:10:37,295
That only accounts for a fifth
of everything that's-- of all


209
0:10:37,295 --> 0:10:38,44
the trash that's here.


210
0:10:38,44 --> 0:10:41,11
Most of it's coming from land.


211
0:10:41,11 --> 0:10:43,93
And you can tidy things up in
places like the United States


212
0:10:43,93 --> 0:10:47,53
or Japan, but how do you keep
the third-world countries from


213
0:10:47,53 --> 0:10:48,26
doing this?


214
0:10:48,26 --> 0:10:51,3
Especially when we're shipping
out all our fucking


215
0:10:51,3 --> 0:10:52,28
manufacturing there.


216
0:10:52,28 --> 0:10:55,14



217
0:10:55,14 --> 0:10:56,6
CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE: If we
solve the plastic problem, we


218
0:10:56,6 --> 0:11:0,32
would, at the same time, solve
a lot of our social problems,


219
0:11:0,32 --> 0:11:4,99
which is keeping us tied down
to, basically, a rat race.


220
0:11:4,99 --> 0:11:7,3
I mean, I'm not the first
one to describe our


221
0:11:7,3 --> 0:11:8,53
system as a rat race.


222
0:11:8,53 --> 0:11:10,903
The plastic plays a
big part of it.


223
0:11:10,903 --> 0:11:16,26
It just fits the mold of this
repressive totality, which


224
0:11:16,26 --> 0:11:21,5
doesn't allow people to
think outside the box.


225
0:11:21,5 --> 0:11:22,4
MEREDITH DANLUCK: Well,
that's the thing.


226
0:11:22,4 --> 0:11:26,43
It's like, does this need to
be, like, the money, glamor


227
0:11:26,43 --> 0:11:29,89
shot that we had all thought
it was going be of, like, a


228
0:11:29,89 --> 0:11:30,8
ton of garbage?


229
0:11:30,8 --> 0:11:32,515
This is actually worse.


230
0:11:32,515 --> 0:11:33,305
THOMAS MORTON: It's way worse.


231
0:11:33,305 --> 0:11:34,36
It's not as glamorous, but--


232
0:11:34,36 --> 0:11:37,38
MEREDITH DANLUCK: It's totally
not, like, the money shot, but


233
0:11:37,38 --> 0:11:39,36
it's totally worse.


234
0:11:39,36 --> 0:11:41,835
There is a shift of
understanding happening for


235
0:11:41,835 --> 0:11:45,51
all of us, I think, in
terms of, you know,


236
0:11:45,51 --> 0:11:47,48
what this area is.


237
0:11:47,48 --> 0:11:48,6
It's not--


238
0:11:48,6 --> 0:11:51,19
it's not a big garbage dump the
size of Texas floating in


239
0:11:51,19 --> 0:11:53,854
the middle of the Pacific.


240
0:11:53,854 --> 0:11:58,2
It's almost like tobacco,
tobacco in the '50s.


241
0:11:58,2 --> 0:12:1,74
Everyone was like, there's
no problem with tobacco.


242
0:12:1,74 --> 0:12:1,93
THOMAS MORTON: Yeah.


243
0:12:1,93 --> 0:12:2,63
Well, it's because tobacco--


244
0:12:2,63 --> 0:12:4,21
it's like plastics telling
us there's no


245
0:12:4,21 --> 0:12:5,9
problem with plastics.


246
0:12:5,9 --> 0:12:6,85
MEREDITH DANLUCK: Yeah, it's
like a huge industry that's so


247
0:12:6,85 --> 0:12:12,47
systemic that nobody's really
taken the time to understand.


248
0:12:12,47 --> 0:12:13,76
THOMAS MORTON: It's entered
the food chain.


249
0:12:13,76 --> 0:12:14,862
It's in--


250
0:12:14,862 --> 0:12:17,59
it's in all the water
we've been around.


251
0:12:17,59 --> 0:12:20,51
And we haven't even started
to try to combat this.


252
0:12:20,51 --> 0:12:25,35
I mean, Charlie is out
here, uh, like,


253
0:12:25,35 --> 0:12:26,74
studying the effects.


254
0:12:26,74 --> 0:12:29,58
Greenpeace sends, like, a
trawler every so often to try


255
0:12:29,58 --> 0:12:31,2
to pull pieces out.


256
0:12:31,2 --> 0:12:34,13
But it's the composition
of the ocean now.


257
0:12:34,13 --> 0:12:36,96
It's not just a matter
of pulling shit out.


258
0:12:36,96 --> 0:12:42,64
It's a matter of, like,
preparing our systems for the


259
0:12:42,64 --> 0:12:45,4
change that's on its way.


260
0:12:45,4 --> 0:12:47,93
Basically, we've--


261
0:12:47,93 --> 0:12:51,48
without realizing it-- consigned
ourselves to eating


262
0:12:51,48 --> 0:12:52,725
our own shit.


263
0:12:52,725 --> 0:12:57,49
We've been tossing out plastic
for years, and it has come


264
0:12:57,49 --> 0:13:1,594
back and bit us really fucking
hard in the ass already.


265
0:13:1,594 --> 0:13:3,954
[YELLING]


266
0:13:3,954 --> 0:13:4,898
MEREDITH DANLUCK:
There's a net.


267
0:13:4,898 --> 0:13:5,842
THOMAS MORTON: Net.


268
0:13:5,842 --> 0:13:7,258
MEREDITH DANLUCK: There's a
net off the starboard--


269
0:13:7,258 --> 0:13:8,519
THOMAS MORTON: Net off
the starboard.


270
0:13:8,519 --> 0:13:13,678



271
0:13:13,678 --> 0:13:14,84
MEREDITH DANLUCK: Keep your
eyes on it, Jake.


272
0:13:14,84 --> 0:13:39,72
JAKE BURGHART:


273
0:13:39,72 --> 0:13:42,29
THOMAS MORTON: We sort of hit
one of the worst little


274
0:13:42,29 --> 0:13:45,47
payloads of, uh, of
garbage that we've


275
0:13:45,47 --> 0:13:46,62
had this whole voyage.


276
0:13:46,62 --> 0:13:50,9
It was a fucking enormous ghost
net, just floating out


277
0:13:50,9 --> 0:13:51,34
in the middle of nowhere.


278
0:13:51,34 --> 0:13:59,916



279
0:13:59,916 --> 0:14:3,38
CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE: Critical
thinking, it's a


280
0:14:3,38 --> 0:14:6,56
faculty that's in danger in
our present-day society.


281
0:14:6,56 --> 0:14:8,46
Critical thinking.


282
0:14:8,46 --> 0:14:12,27
We live in the happy
consciousness era where it's


283
0:14:12,27 --> 0:14:15,47
like, we're the strongest nation
on Earth, globalization


284
0:14:15,47 --> 0:14:19,24
is inevitable, we've got more
stuff, he who dies with the


285
0:14:19,24 --> 0:14:20,49
most toys wins.


286
0:14:20,49 --> 0:14:28,85



287
0:14:28,85 --> 0:14:33,685
I think that's why I'm so
gung-ho on this plastic thing


288
0:14:33,685 --> 0:14:38,1
is because it's a symbol of the
wrong direction that we're


289
0:14:38,1 --> 0:14:42,17
taking as a society
as a whole.


290
0:14:42,17 --> 0:14:43,895
What is the promise
of civilization?


291
0:14:43,895 --> 0:14:47,4
You know, Descartes said there
was such a thing as a social


292
0:14:47,4 --> 0:14:50,5
contract, that we give up our
individual liberties to the


293
0:14:50,5 --> 0:14:52,8
society as a whole because it
can liberate us greater than


294
0:14:52,8 --> 0:14:54,5
we can do by ourselves.


295
0:14:54,5 --> 0:14:55,85
Is that still the case?


296
0:14:55,85 --> 0:14:57,29
Is it really--


297
0:14:57,29 --> 0:15:0,48
are we getting the bang for the
buck out of our society


298
0:15:0,48 --> 0:15:5,9
and our social institutions
that we give up our


299
0:15:5,9 --> 0:15:7,84
anarchistic tendencies for?


300
0:15:7,84 --> 0:15:9,54
We're caught in the trade
winds of our time.


301
0:15:9,54 --> 0:15:11,478
We can't secede from society.


302
0:15:11,478 --> 0:15:16,372
But we have to plant the seed of
the future in the present.


303
0:15:16,372 --> 0:15:30,27



304
0:15:30,27 --> 0:15:31,52
FEMALE SPEAKER: Pull it
in with the winch.


305
0:15:31,52 --> 0:15:45,9



306
0:15:45,9 --> 0:15:46,674
CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE: Pretty
impressive, isn't it?


307
0:15:46,674 --> 0:15:49,9
What a joke.


308
0:15:49,9 --> 0:15:53,84
[COUGHING]


309
0:15:53,84 --> 0:15:55,67
THOMAS MORTON: Isn't too clear
when you see it underwater,


310
0:15:55,67 --> 0:15:58,116
but it's a lot more obvious
when you get all


311
0:15:58,116 --> 0:15:58,41
the colors out here.


312
0:15:58,41 --> 0:16:0,8
This is made of so many
fucking pieces of net.


313
0:16:0,8 --> 0:16:1,71
CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE: Well
that's what happens.


314
0:16:1,71 --> 0:16:2,65
THOMAS MORTON: Different ones.


315
0:16:2,65 --> 0:16:3,49
It just collects--


316
0:16:3,49 --> 0:16:6,37
like, one net just starts
collecting others.


317
0:16:6,37 --> 0:16:8,21
Just like a tumbleweed.


318
0:16:8,21 --> 0:16:11,15
MEREDITH DANLUCK: Yeah, look how
many-- there's countless


319
0:16:11,15 --> 0:16:14,26
different kinds of
rope in there.


320
0:16:14,26 --> 0:16:15,21
CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE:
I know there's a


321
0:16:15,21 --> 0:16:17,11
toothbrush hiding in here.


322
0:16:17,11 --> 0:16:18,27
MEREDITH DANLUCK: Yeah,
we saw that


323
0:16:18,27 --> 0:16:19,61
toothbrush out in the water.


324
0:16:19,61 --> 0:16:20,3
CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE:
Did you see it?


325
0:16:20,3 --> 0:16:22,44
MEREDITH DANLUCK: Mm-hmm.


326
0:16:22,44 --> 0:16:27,23
And so right now, if we stopped
using plastics, or if


327
0:16:27,23 --> 0:16:30,347
we controlled the runoff of
plastics into the ocean, the


328
0:16:30,347 --> 0:16:33,13
amount of plastic that's
in the ocean now--


329
0:16:33,13 --> 0:16:34,87
there's no way we
can clean it up?


330
0:16:34,87 --> 0:16:35,31
CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE: No.


331
0:16:35,31 --> 0:16:39,9
MEREDITH DANLUCK: But is there
a way that the ocean can--


332
0:16:39,9 --> 0:16:40,62
can process it?


333
0:16:40,62 --> 0:16:42,26
CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE: You
saw it in the ghost net.


334
0:16:42,26 --> 0:16:47,31
You saw the toothbrush, plastic
tarp, strapping, all


335
0:16:47,31 --> 0:16:49,17
these things woven together.


336
0:16:49,17 --> 0:16:51,39
She pulls those over
to these centers.


337
0:16:51,39 --> 0:16:54,25
And then when storms hit, our
islands and beaches are like


338
0:16:54,25 --> 0:16:57,275
sieves in a comb, combing
it out of the ocean.


339
0:16:57,275 --> 0:16:59,45
So she'll eventually
spit it out.


340
0:16:59,45 --> 0:17:2,809
But like I say, she can't spit
it all out if we don't stop


341
0:17:2,809 --> 0:17:3,775
putting it in.


342
0:17:3,775 --> 0:17:5,224
The ocean cannot handle
all this stuff.


343
0:17:5,224 --> 0:17:7,156
What can she do?


344
0:17:7,156 --> 0:17:8,406

345
0:17:8,406 --> 0:17:11,3



346
0:17:11,3 --> 0:17:12,6
I just want everybody
to know this isn't


347
0:17:12,6 --> 0:17:12,9
just a pleasure cruise.


348
0:17:12,9 --> 0:17:13,945
We get out feet wet.


349
0:17:13,945 --> 0:17:18,42
We have to find ghost
nets sometimes.

0:17:18,42 --> 0:17:21,75

mouth.

385
0:18:37,0 --> 0:18:41,964



386
0:18:41,964 --> 0:18:44,923
THOMAS MORTON: We'd seen him
yell at us and stuff when we'd


387
0:18:44,923 --> 0:18:46,22
fuck up the sails and
things like that.


388
0:18:46,22 --> 0:18:48,31
But he's typically really,
really mellow.


389
0:18:48,31 --> 0:18:50,64
That whole problem would have
been avoided if he had just


390
0:18:50,64 --> 0:18:53,71
stored his samples in
plastic beakers.


391
0:18:53,71 --> 0:18:56,492
It was really fucking
heartbreaking, because that


392
0:18:56,492 --> 0:18:59,396
was, like, a good sample, and
he's never going to get that


393
0:18:59,396 --> 0:19:2,55
again on this trip, not for
another bunch of trips.


394
0:19:2,55 --> 0:19:5,92
And it invalidates, you know,
all that we did that


395
0:19:5,92 --> 0:19:8,783
afternoon, which is part of
what he was screaming.


396
0:19:8,783 --> 0:19:11,214
MEREDITH DANLUCK: Was it 16?


397
0:19:11,214 --> 0:19:12,464
THOMAS MORTON: Almost.


398
0:19:12,464 --> 0:19:14,693



399
0:19:14,693 --> 0:19:16,184
MEREDITH DANLUCK: You know,
what can you do?


400
0:19:16,184 --> 0:19:28,63



401
0:19:28,63 --> 0:19:32,2
Today was a spiral into a
totally different place.


402
0:19:32,2 --> 0:19:40,435



403
0:19:40,435 --> 0:19:42,415
What are our comments tonight?


404
0:19:42,415 --> 0:19:43,405
JAKE BURGHART: What?


405
0:19:43,405 --> 0:19:44,395
MEREDITH DANLUCK: What
are our comments?


406
0:19:44,395 --> 0:19:47,86
JAKE BURGHART: Need
more soy milk.


407
0:19:47,86 --> 0:19:49,345
MEREDITH DANLUCK: Where
is the soy milk?


408
0:19:49,345 --> 0:19:56,275



409
0:19:56,275 --> 0:20:0,235
JAKE BURGHART: What
should we do now?


410
0:20:0,235 --> 0:20:2,215
Should we check the
engine rooms?


411
0:20:2,215 --> 0:20:4,195
MEREDITH DANLUCK: Yeah,
check the engine room.


412
0:20:4,195 --> 0:20:5,73
I have to go to the bathroom.


413
0:20:5,73 --> 0:20:6,103
JAKE BURGHART: OK.


414
0:20:6,103 --> 0:20:7,75
MEREDITH DANLUCK: I feel like
I'm destroying this map.


415
0:20:7,75 --> 0:20:10,744
Does he get a new one
for every trip?


416
0:20:10,744 --> 0:20:12,241
[LAUGHING]


417
0:20:12,241 --> 0:20:37,69



418
0:20:37,69 --> 0:20:39,187
MEREDITH DANLUCK: Your
nose is running.


419
0:20:39,187 --> 0:20:40,684
JAKE BURGHART: I I know.


420
0:20:40,684 --> 0:20:42,68
Did I get some snot on you?


421
0:20:42,68 --> 0:20:43,93
MEREDITH DANLUCK: Yeah.


422
0:20:43,93 --> 0:21:20,61



423
0:21:20,61 --> 0:21:22,47
CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE: Right
beneath the large-- you see


424
0:21:22,47 --> 0:21:26,581
that dark cloud above
the white clouds?


425
0:21:26,581 --> 0:21:29,28
Yeah, that's the volcano.


426
0:21:29,28 --> 0:21:29,56
THOMAS MORTON: Land-ho!


427
0:21:29,56 --> 0:21:30,933
CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE:
Look at that, huh?


428
0:21:30,933 --> 0:21:34,28



429
0:21:34,28 --> 0:21:41,12
MALE SPEAKER: 50 miles away.


430
0:21:41,12 --> 0:21:44,97
We just dropped the main
sail for the last time.


431
0:21:44,97 --> 0:21:48,372
And now we're going to pull
in to the harbor.


432
0:21:48,372 --> 0:21:50,34
THOMAS MORTON: That's it.


433
0:21:50,34 --> 0:21:51,59
It's over.


434
0:21:51,59 --> 0:22:15,34



435
0:22:15,34 --> 0:22:18,635
MEREDITH DANLUCK: Oh my god,
it feels really fucked up.


436
0:22:18,635 --> 0:22:22,17
CAPTAIN CHARLES MOORE: Thomas,
how's your stomach?


437
0:22:22,17 --> 0:22:23,51
THOMAS MORTON: So far so good.


438
0:22:23,51 --> 0:22:27,664
This wharf's kind of pretty
wobbly, though.


439
0:22:27,664 --> 0:22:30,7
Whoa, this feels amazing.


440
0:22:30,7 --> 0:22:34,86
This feels like I'm on
fucking shrooms.


441
0:22:34,86 --> 0:22:36,49
MEREDITH DANLUCK: Oh my god,
I feel totally high.


442
0:22:36,49 --> 0:22:39,46



443
0:22:39,46 --> 0:22:41,1
I really feel like
I'm on acid.


444
0:22:41,1 --> 0:22:43,993
THOMAS MORTON: Running
makes no sense when


445
0:22:43,993 --> 0:22:46,216
you try to do it.


446
0:22:46,216 --> 0:22:47,204
[INAUDIBLE].


447
0:22:47,204 --> 0:22:49,18
MEREDITH DANLUCK: Salud.


448
0:22:49,18 --> 0:22:52,638
MALE SPEAKER 1: Salud,
Meredith.


449
0:22:52,638 --> 0:22:54,838
MEREDITH DANLUCK: Welcome
back to civilization.


450
0:22:54,838 --> 0:22:57,208
Isn't it so comfortable
and convenient?


451
0:22:57,208 --> 0:22:59,11
THOMAS MORTON: This is
going to be weird.


452
0:22:59,11 --> 0:22:59,83
We made it.


453
0:22:59,83 --> 0:23:0,735
We're in Hawaii.


454
0:23:0,735 --> 0:23:2,74
We got off the boat, finally.


455
0:23:2,74 --> 0:23:5,163
We kissed our sea
legs goodbye.


456
0:23:5,163 --> 0:23:10,3
And now we can just relax down
here on the world-famous green


457
0:23:10,3 --> 0:23:12,83
sands beaches.


458
0:23:12,83 --> 0:23:14,6
Paradise.


459
0:23:14,6 --> 0:23:15,11
Look at this.


460
0:23:15,11 --> 0:23:20,84
It's everything we've been
seeing the whole time.


461
0:23:20,84 --> 0:23:22,93
Why don't we walk
down a little?


462
0:23:22,93 --> 0:23:26,58
Like, how far can you go from
people and not have to be


463
0:23:26,58 --> 0:23:28,5
wading through their shit?


464
0:23:28,5 --> 0:23:29,99
I guess the moon?


465
0:23:29,99 --> 0:23:32,19
I'm really about to have
like a whole crying


466
0:23:32,19 --> 0:23:34,48
Indian moment here.


467
0:23:34,48 --> 0:23:36,96
Can you even imagine
cleaning this up?


468
0:23:36,96 --> 0:23:41,562
Every little piece that you see
here is fucking plastic.


469
0:23:41,562 --> 0:23:45,89
What we're looking at right now
may look worse than what


470
0:23:45,89 --> 0:23:49,66
we've seen in the gyre.


471
0:23:49,66 --> 0:23:51,66
But really, right
now, this is--


472
0:23:51,66 --> 0:23:52,66
this is good as it gets.


473
0:23:52,66 --> 0:23:54,1
This is the best point.


474
0:23:54,1 --> 0:23:58,41
Right now, we could grab this
shit and take it, while it's


475
0:23:58,41 --> 0:24:1,88
still in one piece, and haul
it fucking somewhere.


476
0:24:1,88 --> 0:24:2,9
Who knows?


477
0:24:2,9 --> 0:24:6,1
But uh, in about another
hour or so--


478
0:24:6,1 --> 0:24:9,29
water's coming in right now--
this is all going back out.


479
0:24:9,29 --> 0:24:14,85
I mean, if we've basically
ruined the ocean, what chance


480
0:24:14,85 --> 0:24:17,57
do we have with fucking
land, or with


481
0:24:17,57 --> 0:24:18,87
ourselves, for that matter?


482
0:24:18,87 --> 0:26:18,87
