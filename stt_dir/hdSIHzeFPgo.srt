1
0:0:0,7 --> 0:0:4,15
after the tiny into bob dole out
personality in the shana pre way who is


2
0:0:4,15 --> 0:0:8,8
a lawyer i wrote this plot for c_n_n_
dot com in in the blog she talks about


3
0:0:8,8 --> 0:0:11,79
our own personal experience with right
uh... after she was raped she did become


4
0:0:11,79 --> 0:0:16,94
pregnant and she had decided to have the
baby and she had a little girl that she


5
0:0:16,94 --> 0:0:19,199
logs is happy with her decision


6
0:0:19,199 --> 0:0:22,57
but even though she made that decision
she has to deal with


7
0:0:22,57 --> 0:0:24,25
consequences if people don't


8
0:0:24,25 --> 0:0:25,47
really think about


9
0:0:25,47 --> 0:0:27,4
and not consequences that


10
0:0:27,4 --> 0:0:31,49
the father of the child wants to have
custody


11
0:0:31,49 --> 0:0:36,579
you know we honestly i did forget panel
was blown away by so article


12
0:0:36,579 --> 0:0:39,61
and by the concept so and you know


13
0:0:39,61 --> 0:0:41,62
as she points out an article


14
0:0:41,62 --> 0:0:44,18
thirty-one u_s_ states


15
0:0:44,18 --> 0:0:47,37
allow a man who fathered through rape


16
0:0:47,37 --> 0:0:52,31
to get custody of his case right so that
show


17
0:0:52,31 --> 0:0:54,56
kanu uh...


18
0:0:54,56 --> 0:1:0,17
an issue an unexplained this puts and
extra conundrum among women because


19
0:1:0,17 --> 0:1:1,31
then


20
0:1:1,31 --> 0:1:3,95
their those guys have leverage


21
0:1:3,95 --> 0:1:7,22
and they get into a situation where they
say well you could testify against him


22
0:1:7,22 --> 0:1:9,58
but then i will would want visitation
rights


23
0:1:9,58 --> 0:1:14,25
or maybe i dropped a visitation rights
request if you don't have so far


24
0:1:14,25 --> 0:1:15,2
power


25
0:1:15,2 --> 0:1:18,259
how does that stresses that


26
0:1:18,259 --> 0:1:20,2
under what


27
0:1:20,2 --> 0:1:21,4
muncy


28
0:1:21,4 --> 0:1:24,64
could be states possibly give visitation
rights


29
0:1:24,64 --> 0:1:27,9
for the fathers who got the kids through
rain


30
0:1:27,9 --> 0:1:29,19
i mean you are not a bad parent


31
0:1:29,19 --> 0:1:33,24
my god i can't recall what would you do
anything slightly wrong and i think it


32
0:1:33,24 --> 0:1:34,9
is a way


33
0:1:34,9 --> 0:1:36,979
you're telling me and i know that's an
exaggeration


34
0:1:36,979 --> 0:1:40,82
but you know what's really trying to
find some way press them make their mom


35
0:1:40,82 --> 0:1:41,84
okay


36
0:1:41,84 --> 0:1:44,259
so this is missus knots


37
0:1:44,259 --> 0:1:48,19
and nonetheless the reform say no no
it's ok so cadre person


38
0:1:48,19 --> 0:1:52,46
but apparently thirty percent women
choose to have the kid anyway which on


39
0:1:52,46 --> 0:1:56,48
blown away by can't believe that that is
an incredible statistic tunes different


40
0:1:56,48 --> 0:1:59,85
studies indicate that thirty percent of
women decide to have the baby even if


41
0:1:59,85 --> 0:2:0,74
they were great


42
0:2:0,74 --> 0:2:4,93
but now it is very short standing up my
insurance they wanna make that i


43
0:2:4,93 --> 0:2:6,45
understand that right


44
0:2:6,45 --> 0:2:7,539
but for that


45
0:2:7,539 --> 0:2:11,6
republicans they think no we don't want
you to have that choice a person an


46
0:2:11,6 --> 0:2:14,89
amendment for example and another two
thousand nine uh... acted by the way


47
0:2:14,89 --> 0:2:16,58
paul ryan and eighteen


48
0:2:16,58 --> 0:2:17,699
co-sponsored


49
0:2:17,699 --> 0:2:18,939
would say that


50
0:2:18,939 --> 0:2:22,499
even in a case of rape and incest in
fact the g_o_p_ platform the dangerous


51
0:2:22,499 --> 0:2:24,11
path two days ago


52
0:2:24,11 --> 0:2:28,76
says the u_n_ a case of rape and incest
it doesn't matter you loss happy kid


53
0:2:28,76 --> 0:2:30,899
that two thousand nine act


54
0:2:30,899 --> 0:2:32,649
makes it criminal


55
0:2:32,649 --> 0:2:35,429
if you have an abortion even if you are
right


56
0:2:35,429 --> 0:2:37,959
the so that they know what a mess


57
0:2:37,959 --> 0:2:41,49
the you get raped you have to have the
rapist said


58
0:2:41,49 --> 0:2:44,789
and then if you don't they put new
wordpress


59
0:2:44,789 --> 0:2:46,439
but if you do have the kid


60
0:2:46,439 --> 0:2:48,759
then you're tethered the rapist for


61
0:2:48,759 --> 0:2:52,94
eighteen years you've got a cm over and
over again as it is visitation rights


62
0:2:52,94 --> 0:2:54,48
if anyone different states


63
0:2:54,48 --> 0:2:56,199
for your kid


64
0:2:56,199 --> 0:2:57,839
it's mindboggling


65
0:2:57,839 --> 0:2:59,79
how can anybody both of these people


66
0:2:59,79 --> 0:3:4,3
i know at look as i read this story of
her as an actually you know wait out the


67
0:3:4,3 --> 0:3:4,939
facts


68
0:3:4,939 --> 0:3:6,26
iced x_-rated


69
0:3:6,26 --> 0:3:10,47
asked why this happens like why is it
that we have these laws that protect the


70
0:3:10,47 --> 0:3:14,239
rapist as opposed to those who have been
right threat why would you give these


71
0:3:14,239 --> 0:3:15,789
men visitation rights


72
0:3:15,789 --> 0:3:19,389
and i think it comes to argument that


73
0:3:19,389 --> 0:3:24,869
a lot of you know hateful people liked i
can say about legitimate rate maybe


74
0:3:24,869 --> 0:3:28,349
these guys out there think wealth you
know we don't know if she was


75
0:3:28,349 --> 0:3:32,649
legitimately rapes so why are we going
to take this man child away from him


76
0:3:32,649 --> 0:3:33,39
bingo


77
0:3:33,39 --> 0:3:37,189
anything sebab perspective to date
always look at it from a male


78
0:3:37,189 --> 0:3:40,829
perspective and a very calm and i
wouldn't want my child taken away and


79
0:3:40,829 --> 0:3:41,719
look


80
0:3:41,719 --> 0:3:46,29
and other state rate is what madeleine
panel will be the guide with a quote all


81
0:3:46,29 --> 0:3:48,189
the time we have these crazy rape ideas


82
0:3:48,189 --> 0:3:49,84
abortion ideas for the first place


83
0:3:49,84 --> 0:3:53,869
places obviously marital rape is in town
he says that in his book


84
0:3:53,869 --> 0:3:54,91
so


85
0:3:54,91 --> 0:3:56,7
but you know


86
0:3:56,7 --> 0:4:0,15
and what they always say when they say
america roe versus wade to and how could


87
0:4:0,15 --> 0:4:1,14
be talked about it


88
0:4:1,14 --> 0:4:5,8
when he had agent on this program just
another day saying that you know these


89
0:4:5,8 --> 0:4:8,299
women they offer a lot


90
0:4:8,299 --> 0:4:14,9
and so they could be lying and then you
take away the poor fathers his patients


91
0:4:14,9 --> 0:4:18,22
but look this is not a thing you'd idbi
proving the court of law you know just


92
0:4:18,22 --> 0:4:20,89
said oh yeah i think that guy who did
something wrong


93
0:4:20,89 --> 0:4:23,899
on on twenty investigation rights though
is


94
0:4:23,899 --> 0:4:26,219
proven accord a while imperial


95
0:4:26,219 --> 0:4:29,68
if the jury of your peers and charges
that are at center


96
0:4:29,68 --> 0:4:33,88
but it's because they don't care and out
they don't they are care and also you


97
0:4:33,88 --> 0:4:38,36
have to keep in mind first of all allot
of great is unreported in the u_s_ and i


98
0:4:38,36 --> 0:4:42,8
know weitzman reported it's because it's
tremendously difficult to prove that


99
0:4:42,8 --> 0:4:43,279
you've been raped


100
0:4:43,279 --> 0:4:46,909
okay because of course to you and that
man has to be guilty beyond a reasonable


101
0:4:46,909 --> 0:4:47,65
doubt


102
0:4:47,65 --> 0:4:52,18
and it's difficult when it's a game of
he said she said so even if she said no


103
0:4:52,18 --> 0:4:56,5
even if there was afb you know for
physical altercation with she tried to


104
0:4:56,5 --> 0:4:57,0
push him off


105
0:4:57,0 --> 0:4:59,86
improve that that's a very difficult
thing to prove


106
0:4:59,86 --> 0:5:3,129
so these guys get to continue making
these ridiculous arguments about


107
0:5:3,129 --> 0:5:4,27
legitimate rape


108
0:5:4,27 --> 0:5:8,19
where and then at the same time women
will get raped in guys get away with it


109
0:5:8,19 --> 0:5:11,58
because they know they can get away with
it looks every seven percent country


110
0:5:11,58 --> 0:5:12,68
thinks that


111
0:5:12,68 --> 0:5:14,43
abortion should be believed


112
0:5:14,43 --> 0:5:17,489
some believe additionally your honor all
circumstances


113
0:5:17,489 --> 0:5:21,69
but great majority finishing the legal
under most circumstances you noted


114
0:5:21,69 --> 0:5:24,94
anybody hannah says beyond twenty weeks
you think that it should not be legal


115
0:5:24,94 --> 0:5:28,849
now most people things beyond twenty
four weeks it's our lead others arias


116
0:5:28,849 --> 0:5:32,599
was seventy seven percent of us degraded
it should not be illegal right in all


117
0:5:32,599 --> 0:5:36,559
sorts of only seventeen percent say
illegal under all circumstances


118
0:5:36,559 --> 0:5:39,159
yet but those guys are somehow incharge


119
0:5:39,159 --> 0:5:43,97
now look i was sure you charter graphic
file these are the long's that work


120
0:5:43,97 --> 0:5:44,88
past


121
0:5:44,88 --> 0:5:46,879
to restrict abortion rights


122
0:5:46,879 --> 0:5:49,59
uh... since nineteen ninety five


123
0:5:49,59 --> 0:5:52,669
the have added up to seven hundred and


124
0:5:52,669 --> 0:5:54,86
keen different laws


125
0:5:54,86 --> 0:5:57,21
passable most all by republicans


126
0:5:57,21 --> 0:5:58,65
to take away your rights


127
0:5:58,65 --> 0:6:0,619
in all the different states


128
0:6:0,619 --> 0:6:5,39
since nineteen ninety-five and you see a
big jump to in twenty ten that's when


129
0:6:5,39 --> 0:6:6,96
even the more radical right wing


130
0:6:6,96 --> 0:6:11,99
republicans take over


131
0:6:11,99 --> 0:6:15,219
it's happening all across the country
they're taking away our rights and what


132
0:6:15,219 --> 0:6:18,58
times you don't realize it until you get
run into a situation like this woman did


133
0:6:18,58 --> 0:6:20,89
or for c_n_n_


134
0:6:20,89 --> 0:6:20,819
and then you're


135
0:6:20,819 --> 0:6:22,559
cac bo leaving one


136
0:6:22,559 --> 0:6:23,639
that to you


137
0:6:23,639 --> 0:6:25,93
yet but they warned and they are


138
0:6:25,93 --> 0:8:25,93
and they do it all over the country
