###4 GARY A. HAUGEN: Well, I didn't plan
###6 to come to Google to get razzed about my hair,
###8 but I guess you just don't know what to expect.
###10 So thanks for keeping me on my toes, Justin.
###13 Thank you all for joining me today.
###15 It's a great privilege to get to be here.
###17 I would like to share a little bit about the problems
###20 of violence in the developing world,
###21 but I like to start with a story from Oregon,
###24 the State of Oregon.
###25 And maybe some of you are joining us
###27 from Northern California might relate.
###31 So there's this young woman just a few months ago
###33 who's home alone in her house.
###35 She lives in a rural area, and just a few months before,
###39 actually, she had been horrifically assaulted
###42 by this guy.
###44 And this guy is now at her house, actually.
###48 It's a weekend night.
###49 She's alone, it's dark, and this guy's
###51 actually tearing his way into her house.
###54 And she does what anyone else would
###55 do, she picks up to the phone to call 911, right?
###59 And then what proceeds to happen is
###61 the 911 operator engages this very, very tense conversation
###67 where she explains to this young woman that I'm sorry,
###70 but because of budget cuts in your area,
###73 you don't have law enforcement in your area.
###77 That there's no one that we can send for you.
###81 Law enforcement was available on the weekdays,
###84 but this was the weekend.
###86 And there's this incredibly painful
###88 10 minutes of conversation where this 911 operator realized
###92 there's just nothing that she can do for this woman.
###96 And horrifically, of course, the man
###99 did make his way into the house, horrifically assaults her,
###102 and rapes her.
###103 And this story did sort of make the news around the world,
###107 and the reason I share it, though,
###108 is because this is an example of what billions
###113 of poor people in the world live in as their daily reality.
###118 Why is that?
###119 Because they don't have law enforcement in their area.
###122 A recent UN study found that about four billion people
###126 in the world live outside the protection of law.
###131 And one of things we're trying to do in this book,
###133 "The Locust Effect" is first of all, get the news of this out.
###136 And then have us pause together to think
###138 about that for a moment.
###139 What if billions, especially of the poorest people
###142 in the world, don't have access to basic law enforcement?
###146 What does that look like?
###147 Well, we know a bit what it feels
###149 like because of this story of this woman.
###150 But it looks like something different in Bolivia,
###153 for instance, where according to statistics, if you sexually
###157 assault a child in Bolivia, you actually
###160 are at greater risk of slipping in the shower
###163 and dying than you are of actually being convicted
###165 for that crime.
###166 And as a result, there just an epidemic of sexual violence
###169 against women and girls in Bolivia.
###172 In India, amazingly, if you enslave someone
###176 you have a greater chance of being struck by lightning
###179 than ever being actually convicted for that crime.
###182 So this is what it looks like in the developing world when
###185 you have this complete collapse of law enforcement.
###189 And then what "The Locust Effect" tries to do
###191 is then tell the story of the violence
###193 that this collapse has unleashed for the poorest in the world.
###197 And we go to four categories of violence against the poor.
###201 The first one is what we call gender violence.
###203 It's just sexual violence and domestic abuse
###205 against women and girls.
###207 Which according to the World Health Organization,
###209 it accounts for more death and disability in the world
###212 than malaria, cancer, car accidents, and war
###217 all combined.
###219 The greatest threat for the average poor person
###222 in the developing world, especially a woman or a girl
###224 is violence close at home, sexual violence,
###227 or domestic abuse.
###230 I got to know a good deal about this working
###232 with International Justice Mission which,
###235 by the way, so grateful for Google's partnership
###238 in this work trying to protect the poorest from violence.
###242 And what we do is we have teams in the developing world who
###246 are local indigenous nationals, and they
###249 are lawyers, and criminal investigators,
###251 and social workers and they take on these cases of violent abuse
###254 and oppression on behalf of the victims
###257 and seek justice for them.
###258 Make sure the perpetrators are brought to justice,
###261 and make sure that we provide long-term care
###263 for the survivors of this abuse.
###265 And so now we've been doing this for almost 20 years,
###268 we've had 10s of thousands of cases of this violent abuse.
###271 And it's getting to know those cases that
###273 allows us to see the reality.
###275 And it came on for me meeting this woman, Lucilla in Peru.
###280 Lucilla's a common Andean mom who's
###284 trying to provide for her little family.
###285 And as I got to know her, I came to know
###287 the story of living in her little town,
###289 she experienced the horrific rape and murder
###292 of her eight-year-old girl who was just
###293 dumped out on the street.
###295 They didn't even have the-- I don't know.
###297 They didn't even bother with the shame
###299 of like throwing her in the river or anything.
###301 They just left her out on the street.
###303 And to follow Lucilla on the journey
###307 to see what it means to try to get justice
###309 for such a crime when you have no functioning law enforcement.
###313 One of things I found out about Lucilla's little town
###316 in the Andean mountains is that it actually
###318 had a higher rate of sexual assault against women and girls
###322 than what was coming out of the worst war zones of the Congo.
###325 And this was also the idea that there
###327 can be levels of violence taking place
###329 that maybe in the headlines we hear about it when it's
###333 in a war, or a conflict, or a genocide,
###335 but we're talking in this book about everyday violence.
###339 The second category of everyday violence that afflicts the poor
###342 is straight up slavery.
###345 The global slavery index just came out in October,
###348 and it affirmed that there's about 30 million people
###352 in the world who are literally held in slavery.
###354 That's more people in slavery than at any other time
###357 in human history.
###358 About 11 million people were extracted from Africa
###361 during 400 years of the transatlantic slave trade.
###364 But today, there's about 30 million held in slavery.
###368 In the book, you get the sort of up close view of this
###372 from getting to know Mariama and the story of her family
###376 and a number of other villagers who
###378 were held as slaves in a brick factory.
###380 And this is not in some completely remote lawless
###384 part of India either.
###385 This is really just on the beltway outside Bangalore,
###390 which is as you know the high-tech capital
###392 in many ways of India.
###393 But it would just take us a matter of minutes
###396 before we could be able to drive with investigators to be
###398 able to find places of literal slavery.
###401 So that's the second category of violence is slavery.
###406 Third is the reality of police abuse in the lives of the poor.
###411 The World Bank did this global study
###414 which revealed that, it said, police and courts
###417 in the developing world actually make
###419 poor people less secure and poorer.
###423 What you find is that poor people in the developing world
###426 don't run to the police for protection and to be safe.
###428 They run from the police to be protected and safe.
###432 Statistics will also show that the police are
###435 likely to actually steal more from a common poor person
###438 than anybody else in their community just
###440 from the daily grind of extortion and bribery.
###443 So that's the fourth category of violence.
###446 I mean, the third.
###446 The fourth is violent land seizure,
###449 the way that millions of poor people every year
###452 are threatened with having their land stolen from them.
###454 In fact, about 5 million a year find themselves forcibly
###458 thrown off their land.
###460 One of the largest categories of victims of land theft
###463 are widows.
###464 Widows like, Susan, who is one our clients in Uganda.
###468 And one of the things we don't realize
###470 is that widows in the developing world
###472 support about a half a billion orphans.
###476 And so if you throw that family off their little plot of land
###479 where they have their little shelter,
###480 and their little garden, and they're
###482 trying to sort of make their way out of poverty,
###484 you have just decimated their capacity to go forward.
###488 All of this I emphasize is what we're
###490 calling everyday violence.
###493 Because many times when we see or hear about violence,
###495 it's the stuff that makes the headlines,
###498 the big wars, the genocide.
###500 I know something about the phenomena of genocide.
###503 I was the Director of the UN's genocide in Rwanda in 1994.
###509 And my job was to sort through about 100 different mass graves
###513 and massacre sites to see what it looks like when
###515 human beings just unleash violence against one another.
###519 And the things that you notice when
###520 you're digging through all of that,
###522 and you trying to picture what's it
###524 like in the moment of genocide to be in that place,
###526 you realize that that person in the moment of terror
###529 is really not crying out for someone to bring them
###531 food, or a doctor, or a teacher, or a microloan, right?
###535 They're crying out for someone to restrain
###537 the hand of the machete that's coming
###538 towards them and their family.
###540 And this is what we are identifying
###543 in terms of our engagement with the poor.
###545 We know a great deal about providing food, and medicine,
###548 and education, and other basic needs,
###550 but what about the violence?
###553 And so this is an effort through "The Locust Effect"
###555 to begin to open our eyes to this epidemic.
###558 We're calling it "The Locust Effect."
###560 It comes from these stories from history
###562 that are very powerful when you've
###563 got these poor farmers who were sort of starting to scrape
###566 their way out of poverty, and all of their work and ambition
###570 is in their crops, right?
###572 And they see them growing and they offer great promise.
###575 And then one day, the locust just descend.
###577 And honestly, in a matter of hours,
###579 they will just wipe out years of work.
###582 And this is the way violence operates in the developing
###585 world for the poor who are trying to get out of poverty.
###589 The violent predators just come through and take it away.
###593 And so this means there are tremendous implications for all
###597 of us who care about global poverty.
###598 Probably all of us in our lifetime in some way
###601 have been engaged with that struggle, right?
###602 We've given some money.
###604 We've sought fresh water.
###606 We've sponsored a child.
###607 We've helped with a school somewhere.
###609 We sponsored a microloan.
###611 And so all of these are extremely important efforts,
###615 and we've seen a lot of significant progress
###618 over the last 30 years in addressing poverty.
###621 But what we're starting to see now
###622 is we may be reaching the limit of what
###624 can be done if we don't begin to address
###627 the locust of violence who can come in and just sweep
###630 the benefits of all that effort away.
###632 The thing you'll notice about the locust as well,
###634 is that not only do the locust descend and destroy
###637 the fruit of the farmer, but the farmer
###640 is not going to stop the locust.
###643 Right?
###643 We have to actually start to do something differently.
###647 And so that's what "The Locust Effect" is trying to do
###650 is to begin to change the conversation about poverty
###652 to make sure that we're mainstreaming
###654 the problem of violence.
###656 Because if that's off the radar screen,
###659 we're going to miss out on something that's
###661 undermining all of our good work.
###663 One of the things that the book tries to do
###664 is to try to say, well, why is law enforcement so broken
###668 in the developing world?
###669 Why is there such a lawless chaos
###671 for the average poor person?
###674 The book brings forth really three surprises,
###676 and then one thing that's not so surprising.
###678 The first surprise is to realize, oh,
###680 all of these law enforcement systems in the developing
###682 world, they were never designed to stop crime.
###686 They were never designed to protect the common poor person
###688 from violence.
###689 They were set up by colonial powers over the first stage
###693 of the 20th century in order to protect the government
###696 from the common people.
###698 And they've never been re-engineered to actually
###701 enforce the law.
###702 And as a result, poor people in the developing world
###704 now have great laws.
###706 This tremendous human rights revolution over the last 50
###708 years has embedded great laws in these countries.
###712 But what they don't have is law enforcement.
###713 And it turns out that that really matters.
###716 And mostly because they've been saddled
###717 with these colonial systems of law enforcement
###719 that have never been re-engineered.
###721 The second reason you find out is
###723 that there's been a massive privatization of security
###726 in the developing world.
###727 So if you've been traveling in the developing world at all,
###730 you'll sort of maybe notice, especially in your first visit
###733 there, like almost everywhere I go
###734 somebody's got a gun guarding us.
###735 I mean, he's at the restaurant, at the hotel,
###739 they're at the whatever sort of commercial enterprise.
###742 There are just people providing physical protection
###746 all the time.
###746 I was at the World Economic Forum at Davos
###749 a few years ago with a number of corporate leaders
###752 who have massive investments in the developing
###755 world, huge facilities, thousands
###759 and thousands of employees.
###760 And I just asked with all this violence in the developing
###762 world that we're aware of, like how do you guys protect
###765 your people and your property?
###767 And they all kind of look at each other,
###768 and they actually almost answer in unison to say,
###771 we pay for it.
###773 But if you think about this, it's
###775 one thing if those with wealth and influence
###778 leave the public school and the public school kind of gets bad.
###782 Or you leave the public transportation system,
###785 and the buses become not so great.
###786 But what happens when the people of wealth and power
###788 abandon the public justice system?
###791 When the basic law enforcement system
###793 is allowed to get worse, and worse, and worse?
###796 That is the reality in the developing world.
###798 And part of the reason it stayed off
###799 the radar screen of everybody is that the sector
###803 of wealthy folks in the developing world from whom
###807 the economic growth is coming from,
###810 have been able to secure themselves
###812 with private security.
###813 And so now, in the aggregate, if you look at that country,
###816 it produces a decent rate of economic growth.
###818 But for people who are living off, let's say, $2 a day,
###822 that's about more than 2 billion people,
###825 those folks can afford to be safe and so they're not.
###828 
###832 The third other surprising reason
###833 behind sort of the brokenness of law enforcement
###835 is it's just not been the subject of our investment.
###838 We've poured trillions of dollars over the last 50 years
###841 into food systems, water systems, public health systems,
###844 all totally vital, and actually we haven't necessarily
###847 spent enough on trying to engage those systems,
###849 because the poor need all of those things.
###852 But we can't find even 1% of all that expenditure and effort
###857 over the last 50 years that has gone to building public justice
###861 systems that will actually protect the poor from violence.
###863 So the third surprise is to say, oh, we haven't actually
###866 really tried all that hard to address this problem yet.
###869 The fourth explanation is less surprising, perhaps,
###872 and that's just the idea that there
###874 are people in power in the developing world who
###877 have figured out how to succeed in the absence
###880 of public justice, right?
###881 And so they now actually would feel quite threatened
###884 if justice systems actually started working in the way
###888 that they should.
###889 So that's the diagnosis that we're
###891 trying to make here in "The Locust Effect,"
###893 but then we try to make a turn towards hope.
###895 And that is to ask, OK great, this
###897 is totally depressing, massive violence, grotesque.
###901 There's no way I'm going to read this book.
###904 I'm depressed already.
###905 My wife is like, yeah, give me a gin
###907 and tonic the next time I'm going
###908 to try to read one of your books, Gary.
###911 So yeah, the bad news is true.
###913 But this is part of where the good news comes from, right?
###915 Because if you think about the era
###917 when the AIDS epidemic was really
###919 beginning to catch momentum in the world,
###921 it required everybody to open their eyes to something
###924 that was still a little beneath the surface,
###926 but if unaddressed was going to roll over just
###929 about everything else.
###930 And that's where we are when it comes
###932 to the phenomenon of violence in the developing world.
###934 So yes, we've got to wake up to what is the tough reality.
###939 But the hope can be found in a number of areas.
###941 The first is just in history.
###944 The truth is all of us enjoy reasonably functioning justice
###948 systems here in New York, or you can be in the San Francisco Bay
###952 Area, or Chicago, or you're around the world in Paris
###955 or Tokyo, or various places around the world that
###957 have the more developed and affluent economies.
###960 And in each one of those cities, you
###963 will find a history where 100 years ago, 150 years ago, you
###967 would have had the exact same levels of just
###969 horrific violence and horrific police corruption
###972 and brutality.
###974 In the book, we give actually a series
###976 of descriptions to ask you, like, guess which city this is?
###979 And you think your reading from some just nightmare
###982 of a city in the developing world,
###983 but actually it's one of the cities that we live in.
###986 And you can see, oh, every country
###989 begins with a difficult situation of lawless violence,
###992 and you need to build systems to protect the common citizenry.
###996 So what is the process by which you
###999 move to law enforcement that actually
###1002 protects the common person?
###1004 And you learn that this is actually quite a doable thing.
###1007 So you learn these lessons from history
###1009 and some clues about what might happen in the developing world,
###1012 but also some very specific projects
###1014 that we have highlighted in the book where the success is
###1018 really very encouraging that if you focus on helping
###1021 law enforcement do its job, it has a dramatic result.
###1024 One of those projects we did in the second largest city
###1029 of the Philippines called Cebu which
###1032 had a horrible problem of child sex trafficking.
###1036 The abduction and taking of these young minor girls
###1040 into the commercial sex industry,
###1042 and it's just a business of rape for profit.
###1045 And this was just taking place at a horrific level
###1049 in the city of Cebu.
###1051 And we got some funding from the Gates Foundation
###1053 to try and experiment.
###1055 Let's see whether or not it's possible to do two things.
###1057 Number one, let's see if we can actually stand up
###1059 local law enforcement, which when we first
###1062 began the project in the city, it was actually
###1065 on almost on the side of sex trafficking, right?
###1067 They're actually protecting this and receiving funding
###1070 for doing so.
###1072 And by the way, the people who carried out this project
###1074 were our local Filipino staff, right?
###1077 Local Filipino lawyers, Filipino criminal investigators,
###1080 and social workers, and they were trying to do two things.
###1082 One, can we stand up that local law enforcement
###1084 through training and programs of empowerment
###1087 that allow them to actually begin
###1088 to send sex traffickers to jail?
###1091 And if we do that, will it actually
###1093 then lower the amount of sex trafficking
###1095 of kids in the city?
###1096 So we had some outside auditors come in at the beginning
###1099 and measure, well, how much victimization of kids
###1101 is there in the sex trade before the project even begins.
###1104 And then let's measure it four years later
###1106 to see what the impact is.
###1108 So four years training law enforcement,
###1111 setting up specialized units, fast tracking courts,
###1115 providing good social services to the victim,
###1117 so they could actually make their way through the justice
###1120 system and receive healing.
###1122 So after rescuing hundreds of those victims
###1125 and then sending about hundred of the traffickers to jail,
###1128 what was the outcome after four years?
###1132 The goal of the project was to try
###1133 to achieve a 20% reduction in the victimization of kids
###1137 in the commercial sex trade.
###1139 But after four years, the auditors came back and measured
###1142 and they found a 79% reduction in the victimization of kids
###1146 in the commercial sex trade.
###1148 And what you find is that those who brutalize the poor,
###1152 and children especially, are not brave people.
###1156 They're doing it because they can.
###1158 And once they start getting in trouble for it,
###1160 they start to leave the children and the kids alone.
###1163 So this is sort of the reality that we're helping people
###1165 to recover through the book.
###1167 That, yes, there's a real serious problem in the world,
###1170 but there's really hopeful possibilities
###1174 for making a difference.
###1176 I would, of course, say that the real purpose of this book
###1181 is to begin to change the conversation about poverty,
###1183 right?
###1184 Because if you enter a discussion
###1186 about global poverty, if you think
###1187 of the phenomenon of yourself, you
###1189 think of, OK, food and hunger.
###1191 You think of medical care.
###1192 You think of shacks.
###1193 You think of bad sanitation, bad education,
###1195 the need for microloans, all that sort of thing.
###1197 But what does not generally come to our mind
###1199 is the violence that the poor are chronically vulnerable to.
###1202 And we just want to change that conversation
###1204 to make sure we're asking the question, what
###1206 about the violence?
###1208 So we would like you to be a part of that for sure.
###1211 We'd love for you to buy the book, first of all.
###1214 Educate yourself, share it with other people.
###1217 If you buy the book this week, we actually
###1219 have some donors that are going to match
###1222 that with a $20 contribution towards the actual work
###1225 in the field of trying to defend those who are victims of abuse.
###1230 We'll have a copy here.
###1231 And Victor Boutros who's my co-author,
###1233 I always want to recognize him.
###1235 Victor Boutros.
###1236 We're happy to sign those, and that
###1238 will add $0.4 to the value of the book or something.
###1241 
###1244 So we would love for you to buy the book and to share that.
###1248 The second thing we'd like to do is
###1250 actually, have you look at a piece of video
###1252 that we've put together to likewise share on social media.
###1257 Because obviously, we've written this book,
###1259 it's got 40 pages of footnotes.
###1260 It really takes you into sort of the deep intellectual case
###1263 about what's going on.
###1264 But for most of us, in many ways,
###1266 it's important just for us to get a heart level almost
###1270 sense of what this challenge is looking
###1272 like for the common person, and also what the promise is.
###1275 So if you've got two minutes, let's have
###1277 a look at this video, and then talk
###1280 about one more thing we can do together.
###1282 [VIDEO PLAYING]
###1285 
###1466 So that's the second thing we'd love you to do,
###1468 just help get the conversation going
###1470 by sharing that piece of video.
###1472 The third thing, is that right now at the United Nations,
###1477 there's a tremendously important conversation
###1479 taking place related to the Millennium Development Goals.
###1482 In the year 2000, the international community
###1485 came together to build sort of the definitive roadmap
###1488 for addressing poverty, and they set out these eight Millennium
###1491 Development Goals.
###1492 And they've been pursuing them over the last 15 years,
###1494 and have seen some really significant progress
###1497 on those targeted things.
###1498 The big problem that people are starting to realize,
###1501 though, is that they spoke of the massive solution
###1504 to try to deal with poverty, and they did not
###1506 say a word about violence.
###1509 And now, imagine you're trying to move the world forward out
###1513 of poverty, but you're not doing anything
###1515 about this violence that is just ripping
###1517 the rug out from underneath everyone's ability
###1520 to move forward.
###1521 So we have a petition that we're putting together
###1523 and there's a way to sign on there that will just
###1526 be going to the UN team that is starting to put together
###1529 the Millennium Development Goals to say, hey, let's just make
###1532 sure that this conversation includes addressing
###1535 the violence that is descending like locusts upon the poor
###1538 in developing world.
###1540 This is, again, from the AIDS epidemic perspective,
###1543 it wasn't just the public health experts.
###1545 It wasn't just the sort of global affairs experts
###1550 that rang the alarm about the problem,
###1552 and said, no, this is something we need to address.
###1554 It was very, very common people who
###1556 began to think differently about the problems in the world
###1560 and to make sure that we were addressing this epidemic as
###1562 well.
###1563 And I think it's an opportunity for all of us
###1565 to raise our voice on behalf of those
###1567 who are victims of violence as well.
###1569 So thank you very much for the opportunity
###1570 to let me drone on here a bit, but I would love to-- I've
###1573 been trying to guess about what, if any of this,
###1575 might be interesting to you.
###1577 But it, actually, might be better to ask you.
###1578 So what questions do you have?
###1581 How might we engage the conversation together?
###1584 And I understand from Justin, unlike his prior advertisements
###1587 to me, I don't actually get to be
###1589 able to hear from the folks remotely.
###1591 So you guys carry all the burden of asking
###1594 the engaging and good questions.
###1595 So here you go.
###1597 What are thoughts, questions?
###1599 Yes.
###1599 
###1602 AUDIENCE: The question is two for one.
###1605 When you collected help like [INAUDIBLE] and everything
###1607 you mentioned, do we expect-- does that decrease violence
###1612 in those countries that [INAUDIBLE]
###1615 and by which factor?
###1616 And two.
###1618 This experiment that you did in the city
###1620 with the sex trafficking, how much did it cost and can
###1624 you put a price [INAUDIBLE] on this program
###1629 compared to if you had given meals, and food, and whatever,
###1632 what the benefits are.
###1635 GARY A. HAUGEN: Yeah, great question.
###1637 Sort of going at the first one, I mean, the second one first.
###1641 The data on the actual cost of law enforcement
###1646 is available to us.
###1648 It'll give you an idea of what it would cost.
###1650 The data is not very good about how much the economic benefit
###1656 is from all of that.
###1657 And so it's just being very much developed.
###1660 But what you can see, for instance,
###1662 is that where the studies have been done,
###1664 the GDP is reduced somewhere between 2% and 7%
###1670 an entire nation by criminal violence and violence
###1674 in the community.
###1675 You will see, in they did some studies in Latin America where
###1677 they showed half of the accumulated net social capital
###1682 was eliminated, half of it over a 15-year period of time
###1687 because of violence.
###1688 They're starting to begin to develop
###1690 the numerical costs of violence.
###1692 It costs for instance in what they call Disability Adjusted
###1696 Life Years, about 9 million Disability Adjusted life years
###1701 are wasted because of violence against women and girls.
###1705 And so that's massive amounts of productivity.
###1708 What you also know is that the economies that are actually
###1714 producing social mobility are the ones that
###1717 provide protection for those who are poorest.
###1720 Because in the absence of that, they're
###1722 unable to keep even the benefits of their effort.
###1725 Some of this is hard to see, though, because in, as I
###1727 explained a little bit, in low income and middle income
###1730 countries right now, you actually
###1731 see some significant rates of economic growth, reasonable GDP
###1737 advancements.
###1738 But what you see when you look at it, and disaggregate
###1741 it is that that economic growth is
###1743 coming from the sector of the country that
###1746 has protected itself with private security.
###1749 And that's a massive expense, by the way, that
###1753 could be poured into a public security, but at the moment
###1755 is just privatizing part of it.
###1758 One of things that the book does is call for much greater study
###1762 of how much would this cost?
###1764 What would the benefit be?
###1765 But there certainly is now enough data from the World Bank
###1768 and from other multilateral institutions that
###1771 suggest that what is lost to violence is massive.
###1775 And that if we don't get out in front of it, that kind of cost
###1779 is just going to grow.
###1780 Yeah.
###1782 Other questions?
###1783 Thank you.
###1786 AUDIENCE: So the first question was
###1788 people are looking at is from an economic modeling standpoint.
###1791 Are people looking at it also from a public health
###1794 standpoint?
###1795 Because the models might be different.
###1797 And the other question was, I'm curious about the-- I mean,
###1802 solving this at the macro level seems very hard, right?
###1806 Because you have civil societies that may not have traditions,
###1810 and they differ radically.
###1814 So I'd like you to talk a little bit about that.
###1817 Perfect.
###1817 GARY A. HAUGEN: Thank you.
###1818 Yeah, certainly this has, over just maybe the last 15 years,
###1824 been looked at now as an epidemiological matter
###1828 from the public health sector.
###1829 In fact, the World Health Organization, it was about 10,
###1832 15 years ago now, did this massive global study
###1835 about violence as a health problem.
###1837 And that's where much of the data for the book
###1841 is now coming from is the World Health Organization
###1843 and public health experts are dialed
###1845 into sort of the implications, the ripple effects, of violence
###1851 in the lives of poor people.
###1852 What public health has no experience in,
###1855 however, is how you stop the violence.
###1858 And what is then unfortunate is that world
###1860 of law enforcement that actually reduces violent behavior is
###1866 sort of then off in its own silo and public health
###1869 has been off in its silo.
###1870 And what we're encouraging now is
###1871 that those things come together.
###1873 There's been some work done on the economics of violence
###1880 and the way that undermines economic growth.
###1884 But most of that's been done in developed countries.
###1887 So obviously, the data's easier and more available,
###1890 and it's a little too bad the way
###1892 our study tends to run to the places
###1895 where the examination of the problem is easiest.
###1897 That makes sense in a certain kind of way,
###1899 but we do need to bring a lot of those lenses
###1901 now into the developing world to fully appreciate
###1903 what's happening.
###1904 The other question is absolutely the one
###1909 to be answered, which is, wow, this just
###1911 sounds like this massive generic problem that actually is very
###1915 localized in its manifestations, and probably in its solutions,
###1920 how do we begin to address it?
###1923 One of our suggestions in the book
###1925 is precisely that what is needed are some small scale
###1928 experiments in some focused places in the world.
###1932 It's true, for instance, that penicillin works everywhere
###1935 in the world.
###1935 And there are certain ways in which
###1936 law enforcement works everywhere.
###1938 As to say, in almost every context,
###1940 if human beings face a cost for doing a behavior,
###1944 they are reduced in their likelihood of doing it.
###1948 That's just true the same way that penicillin just works.
###1952 But what it takes in a given society and culture
###1956 for law enforcement to be effective
###1958 and to be supported by the community,
###1961 that's a different equation everywhere.
###1963 So we're interested in supporting,
###1964 and actually are pursuing now, we
###1967 have seven different projects around the world,
###1970 like the Cebu one, which says, OK,
###1972 not everywhere and in regard to everything,
###1973 but let's start in a few laboratories
###1975 and begin to experiment.
###1977 What does it take in order to do one thing first,
###1980 stand up local law enforcement?
###1983 Have the police, and the courts, and the public justice system
###1986 actually switch sides.
###1988 So that instead of preying upon the poor,
###1990 they're actually protecting the poor.
###1992 And we've actually learned quite a bit about that.
###1994 And there's some things you see that are
###1996 common in most communities.
###1997 And there's other things that are very particular.
###1999 And so what there needs to be is just
###2001 a much more robust experimentation
###2003 of this in the world.
###2005 Because again, it's not going to come from a silver bullet
###2008 one size fits all.
###2009 We did here in America, so it's going to work over here.
###2012 It's going to be a customized, tailor-made, and community
###2016 owned struggle in order to bring justice for the poor.
###2021 But that's when we need to start to bring resources and effort
###2025 to that's commensurate to the size of the problem.
###2028 Thank you.
###2030 Other questions?
###2032 Please, Justin.
###2033 
###2036 AUDIENCE: So being that we are at Google,
###2038 I'm curious as to what your thoughts are on the role
###2041 that technology can play in being
###2043 a constructive element of these changes.
###2045 GARY A. HAUGEN: Yeah, well, one of things
###2046 I'm hoping technology will do is just sort
###2048 of shrink the world in terms of awareness, right?
###2052 Because one of the things that's difficult in this era is we
###2055 can live on different planetary systems, right?
###2057 I mean, the idea that there are millions of people in slavery.
###2061 The idea that sexual assault can take place at such a level
###2065 that you're more likely to fall in the shower
###2068 than to ever go to jail for it.
###2070 Those can feel so far from us.
###2073 And one of the things that this era has done
###2076 is shrink that world so that everyone
###2078 can be much more aware of this.
###2079 One of things that we're also starting to bring
###2083 is visualization of this.
###2084 I mean, our teams now do undercover investigations
###2087 that expose these kinds of abuses that are taking place.
###2090 And that stuff can now almost be shared real time
###2093 around the world.
###2093 It's going to be harder and harder
###2095 to get away with this stuff.
###2098 But once we have exposure, then we
###2100 need to move actually towards solutions.
###2104 The other thing that technology has a capacity to do,
###2107 amazingly, is bring accountability
###2109 and transparency.
###2110 You're starting to see this in the corruption realm
###2113 now where instead of paying a police
###2118 officer for your ticket on the spot, you go to some kiosk
###2121 somewhere electronically and pay for that.
###2123 So it isn't even the opportunity for the police officer
###2125 to take the money.
###2126 Or to like be able to go to register and say,
###2131 yeah, there were supposed to be police in our community,
###2133 and if this is day 20 where we've never seen anybody,
###2136 and all that sort of data and that picture starts to appear.
###2141 So we're even exploring the ways in which satellite imagery is
###2147 able to actually see where the brick kilns are
###2151 in South Asia where there's more likely to be slavery.
###2155 And the tracking of criminality, the new VP
###2159 of investigations at IJM is the former director of NCIS.
###2164 And he's very interested in trying to leverage technology
###2167 in this crime fighting effort around the world.
###2169 So I'm not the one, certainly, to be
###2172 able to suggest what all the possibilities are,
###2174 but what I would love to do is to see those who have
###2177 this expertise and these capacities just sort of join
###2179 the struggle and the fight.
###2180 
###2183 Yes sir.
###2185 AUDIENCE: Just as an idea, with the proliferation
###2188 of cell phones throughout the world.
###2190 What about the self-reporting?
###2192 GARY A. HAUGEN: Absolutely.
###2193 Yeah, you do notice that right now.
###2195 There are very few bad things that
###2197 happen these days sort of in any kind of public way, especially
###2202 law enforcement and so forth that there aren't
###2204 five people around with a cell phone.
###2207 Challenge, of course, in the poorest communities
###2209 is the people living off $2 a day have less access to that.
###2213 And to be clear, you can see why this
###2215 is why crime runs to those places, right?
###2217 It runs to be amongst the poor, because they're
###2219 going to be the least empowered.
###2222 One of things we do, of course, is
###2224 take that kind of technology into those communities
###2228 and into some of the darkest places where crime is taking
###2230 place, infiltrate it with video technology,
###2234 and now the world can see and know what's going on.
###2237 And that is, you have to know, that when
###2241 you think about violent perpetrators of horrific crime,
###2245 they just seem so intimidating, and how could you ever
###2248 go against them?
###2250 One of the things you have to understand about criminality
###2253 and violence is that there's a reason why they hide it,
###2257 because they're afraid.
###2260 You fundamentally hide what you're
###2261 doing, because you're afraid that if somebody saw it,
###2264 you would be in trouble, and you couldn't get away with it.
###2268 And as our world has the technology increasingly
###2271 for where the bullies cannot do this without being seen,
###2276 they're going to do it less.
###2278 So there's significant promise.
###2280 The question now I think, substantially,
###2281 is how to get those tools increasingly
###2283 in the hands of those who are poorest.
###2284 
###2287 Daniel, did you have a question?
###2289 AUDIENCE: Yeah, you we're talking about experiments.
###2292 I know that there have been a number of things on experiments
###2295 in trying to [INAUDIBLE] poverty like the team of MIT.
###2300 Can we work with them?
###2301 And can you describe some of your other projects?
###2303 GARY A. HAUGEN: Yeah, no, we haven't
###2304 had the opportunity of the poverty lab at MIT
###2306 that actually did a really fantastic project
###2309 with Indian police to actually see
###2313 what it would take for the community to actually begin
###2315 to have greater confidence in working with the police.
###2319 And it's like all great resources,
###2321 a set of things that are confirmed by the data
###2324 that, oh yeah, we really did think that that would help.
###2327 And then also turns out, nope, everybody
###2329 thought this would help.
###2330 Doesn't help at all.
###2332 So we would love to have an opportunity
###2334 to engage some of our work with that kind of very
###2337 careful sort of measurement capacity.
###2340 Because that's what's it's going to take.
###2342 It's going to be sort of taking what
###2344 we think we know about improving these law enforcement systems,
###2347 and then testing it, and measuring, and seeing what
###2350 actually does work and let's put more resources on the things
###2353 actually work.
###2354 Yeah.
###2355 AUDIENCE: So you talked about violence
###2357 as contributing cause to poverty.
###2358 GARY A. HAUGEN: Yeah.
###2359 AUDIENCE: What about the causes of the violence itself?
###2363 How much of that is, perhaps, need driven?
###2367 GARY A. HAUGEN: Yes.
###2367 AUDIENCE: Is it cultural?
###2368 Is it innate?
###2370 Does mankind just suck?
###2372 A very small percentage of people
###2375 having a very large impact on the community,
###2379 or can you discuss violence as an effect?
###2382 GARY A. HAUGEN: I'd love to.
###2385 I will tell you, any of you who'd
###2386 taken a genocide course in college or something
###2389 and look at genocide, I mean, it's disturbing.
###2392 The capacity for the very common person
###2395 to become very, very violent in regard to their neighbors
###2397 is amazing.
###2398 And as the investigator of the Rwanda genocide,
###2402 the story is there that once the restraints were taken off,
###2406 and you could do anything to your neighbor
###2409 to take their land, to sexually assault the neighbor's
###2416 daughter, and to kill your neighbor,
###2419 this is unleashed with quite frightening ferocity.
###2424 So there is something in human beings
###2428 that just needs to be accounted for.
###2431 And we've seen in history, too, that the way that most violence
###2436 is restrained is by law enforcement.
###2438 That's why we all have law enforcement.
###2440 None of you are choosing to live in a neighborhood that
###2443 has no law enforcement.
###2445 But it would be interesting, and if I had a whiteboard here,
###2447 you could draw a graph of crime.
###2450 And on the left axis, you would put different kinds
###2454 of crime and their frequency.
###2458 And then what you do is draw a line
###2461 on the horizontal axis of risk.
###2464 And what you would measure is sort
###2466 of the elasticity of different kinds of crime to risk.
###2470 And at the top is what we call crime of opportunity.
###2475 You do it because you can get away with it,
###2477 and there's no risk at all.
###2479 And so you do it because you can.
###2481 Then there's crime of desperation.
###2484 Maybe I'm poor, and I feel like I got a break that window
###2487 and steal that bread, because I'm really quite desperate.
###2491 Then there's crime of necessity.
###2492 You feel like in order to hold power, or in order to survive,
###2497 you must commit this crime.
###2498 And sometimes when the state commits crime, like torture,
###2502 they feel like they have to do this, right?
###2504 It's necessity.
###2505 And then if you go way down towards the bottom,
###2507 you have social pathology and deviancy.
###2509 A person actually can't even stop themselves
###2511 from committing that crime, because there's
###2513 a sickness involved.
###2514 All of those have different elasticity to risk.
###2519 So the pathology, man, somebody who's really a social deviant,
###2525 and you see this with pedophilia and other-- there you
###2528 can actually ratchet up to risk level.
###2531 And it drops maybe a little bit, but that line actually
###2533 stays pretty steady, because in that they end up
###2535 going to jail in many respects if there's decent law
###2538 enforcement.
###2539 Then you have crime of necessity,
###2541 and likewise, it takes a little dip,
###2543 but then it stays pretty steady, too.
###2548 Desperation, yeah, it takes a fall a little bit,
###2550 but when desperation feels like necessity,
###2554 it also flattens out.
###2555 But crime of opportunity, amazing.
###2558 That stuff goes out a little bit by risk,
###2559 and then it drops off to zero, because it was crime
###2563 because I could get away with it.
###2565 Now I can't get away with it, I'm just not doing any more.
###2567 The vast, vast, vast majority of violence against the poor
###2571 is crime of opportunity.
###2573 And so we can with law enforcement reduce that amount,
###2578 and then we'll be wrestling with the kind of crime
###2580 that we're dealing with in our more developed countries, which
###2584 is the hard problems of social deviancy and people
###2587 who are desperate and have no hope, all kinds of things
###2589 involved here, substance abuse and a whole set of factors
###2594 But all this crime of opportunity, this
###2596 is where all the crime is happening against the poor
###2598 because they can.
###2599 And that is a very, very doable proposition.
###2604 Long lecture on the elasticity of crime
###2606 than you weren't expecting today.
###2609 I apologize in advance.
###2610 
###2613 Any other questions?
###2614 Yes.
###2615 AUDIENCE: What about the real structural situation
###2617 of just the police and underpay?
###2620 And the fact that in many countries being a cop
###2623 is a license to steal.
###2624 GARY A. HAUGEN: Absolutely.
###2625 Yeah.
###2626 So that has to be addressed.
###2628 That's the bad news.
###2629 The good news is it's totally addressable.
###2631 In other words, it's not rocket science in a way.
###2634 I worked the first half of my career,
###2636 and Victor currently is that the US Department of Justice
###2639 dealing with police corruption.
###2640 So in every society, you are going
###2641 to have police corruption, but it actually
###2642 turns out there's things that you can do about this.
###2645 And one of the case studies that we look at in the book
###2648 is the study of the country of Georgia,
###2651 which is a former Soviet Republic.
###2654 And it was one of the most corrupt countries in the world.
###2656 In fact, in 2003, Transparency International
###2659 ranked it as like 143 out of a 190 countries
###2662 in being the most corrupt.
###2663 I mean, more corrupt than any country
###2665 that we currently work in.
###2666 And we work in some very corrupt countries.
###2669 And yet there was a political election,
###2672 a party was committed to a platform, really
###2676 of anti-corruption came into power.
###2678 And they seriously went after police corruption first.
###2682 Just to give you an idea, police corruption in Georgia,
###2684 you would pay $10,000 to the police commissioner
###2688 in order to get hired as a police officer for which you
###2690 are paid $10.
###2693 Why would you pay $10,000 for a job that
###2695 was only going to pay to $10 a month?
###2696 It's because you were given a license really
###2699 to use that authority then to steal from people.
###2702 And what happened as a result, is the state just
###2704 started producing more and more police officers, right?
###2706 Because I get this now.
###2708 The more police officers there are, the more money
###2709 I make as the commissioner of police.
###2711 
###2715 As far as payment, let me just address that.
###2719 So what they did is they came in very committed
###2722 to addressing this.
###2723 The thing they did is they fired 16,000 police officers
###2726 in a single day in the capital.
###2727 Sent them all home, and the place
###2729 was safer and better for it.
###2731 Right?
###2733 Just sent them all home and rebuilt
###2735 the police from the ground up.
###2737 One of the things that they had to do
###2739 was then pay the police very well,
###2742 because they want to recruit good people,
###2744 and equip them well, and supply them well.
###2748 And as a result a lot of this committed effort, by 2010
###2753 seven years later, the Georgian police force
###2756 was rated as less corrupt than the US police,
###2759 the German police, or the French police.
###2761 The World Bank wrote up the study of this,
###2763 and it's featured in the book.
###2766 Because I actually fortuitously sat next
###2768 to the prime minister of Georgia,
###2770 because I was amazed at this story.
###2771 And I got a chance to talk to him over dinner about it.
###2773 And he said people say that corruption is culture.
###2775 He says, corruption is a choice.
###2778 And when a society makes the choice
###2780 to begin to root this out, it's possible.
###2782 And the place to start amazingly is the police,
###2785 because it sounds counterintuitive in a way,
###2787 because that's like the worst, scariest place.
###2789 But if you think about it, corruption is a crime.
###2792 It's stealing from other people.
###2794 And if you have crime of corruption in the crime
###2798 fighting force, your capacity to root it out from other places
###2802 is just about zero.
###2803 So we've kind of laughed about it and joked about it.
###2806 Oh, the police are corrupt in the developing world.
###2808 No, no, that's a serious problem,
###2810 because that has undermined your capacity
###2812 to deal with any corruption in your country.
###2814 And so that's the bad news.
###2815 The good news is, because this is a command structure,
###2818 leadership can actually change that
###2820 quite quickly if there's commitment from the top.
###2823 
###2825 Any other questions?
###2826 Yes.
###2829 AUDIENCE: You make a sensible point, right?
###2830 We buy the story and everything.
###2832 Why [INAUDIBLE], they have the money and everything,
###2836 why nothing has happened?
###2837 GARY A. HAUGEN: Yeah, Great question,
###2839 which is why isn't everybody already
###2840 addressing this already?
###2841 That's a hard question, too.
###2843 And actually, I've spent the last 10 years going around
###2847 to almost every smart person I can.
###2849 Because as they started to come to our eyes
###2851 from just the daily work in the developing world, it's like,
###2854 hey, isn't this is a big problem,
###2855 and isn't this just going to get worse,
###2857 and don't we need to get out in front of it?
###2859 There are some reasons why it's been very difficult.
###2861 One of the reasons is that the people
###2864 who are immersed in the academic and sort
###2867 of technical disciplines of fighting poverty
###2870 are just very foreign to the world of law enforcement,
###2873 right?
###2873 So it's the economist, the agronomist, the clean water
###2876 engineers, the public health folks.
###2880 What it takes to actually do a highly effective law
###2887 enforcement is a completely different discipline.
###2889 So these worlds have been very far apart,
###2891 and we're trying to bring them together.
###2893 The second thing is that it's been dangerous and scary
###2897 for aid organizations to engage supporting law enforcement
###2902 in the developing world, because law enforcement is not
###2904 a benign system.
###2906 Right?
###2908 Because it's a coercive system.
###2910 It's the coercive arm of the state, and if it turns bad,
###2912 it commits abuses.
###2914 Now you helped empower it, and you're like, oh,
###2916 now we're in trouble for that.
###2917 So we actually made illegal after human rights
###2919 abuses in the 70s and 80s for aid organizations
###2923 to assist police.
###2925 Now it seemed like a good idea to like stop the abuses,
###2928 but the answer to bad law enforcement
###2930 is not going to be no law enforcement.
###2932 So we need to say, yeah, there's a bad way
###2934 to assist law enforcement.
###2937 But they're also clearly now some good ways to do it,
###2939 and that's what we need to pursue.
###2941 Thanks again for your patience and interest.
###2943 And please buy the book, and share the video,
###2947 and help us change the discussion on the Millennium
###2949 Development Goals.
###2950 Thanks very much.
