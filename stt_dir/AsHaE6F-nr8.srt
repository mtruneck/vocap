0:0:0,0 --> 0:0:2,1



2
0:0:2,1 --> 0:0:3,1
SHOENICE: Hi.


3
0:0:3,1 --> 0:0:8,35
My name is Shoenice Shoenice,
a.k.a., Shoenice22.


4
0:0:8,35 --> 0:0:10,87
A lot of people think I'm
a complete idiot.


5
0:0:10,87 --> 0:0:13,35
But actually I'm a professional
idiot with


6
0:0:13,35 --> 0:0:15,7
decades of experience.


7
0:0:15,7 --> 0:0:19,46
On your marks, get
set, Shoenice.


8
0:0:19,46 --> 0:0:23,67
And I just open up my throat
and just something happens,


9
0:0:23,67 --> 0:0:24,58
and I just know.


10
0:0:24,58 --> 0:0:27,79
It's like Evel Knievel jumping
over them 20 buses.


11
0:0:27,79 --> 0:0:28,91
He knows he can die.


12
0:0:28,91 --> 0:0:32,695
But once he gets over it,
it's epic for life.


13
0:0:32,695 --> 0:0:33,945
Here's to you.


14
0:0:33,945 --> 0:0:46,645



15
0:0:46,645 --> 0:0:49,35
People must think I'm nuts.


16
0:0:49,35 --> 0:0:51,17
I'm in the right place
at the right time to


17
0:0:51,17 --> 0:0:52,4
do whatever I want.


18
0:0:52,4 --> 0:0:54,64
I don't want to be president
of the United States.


19
0:0:54,64 --> 0:0:57,12
I'll save the world from the
number one YouTube channel.


20
0:0:57,12 --> 0:1:8,57



21
0:1:8,57 --> 0:1:9,29
It's a nice day today.


22
0:1:9,29 --> 0:1:11,1
A nice day to go swimming.


23
0:1:11,1 --> 0:1:14,18
Maybe we'll go swimming
later on.


24
0:1:14,18 --> 0:1:16,99
All I do is travel around
the world, you know?


25
0:1:16,99 --> 0:1:19,9
My family threw me out
two years ago.


26
0:1:19,9 --> 0:1:23,66
Because they just didn't
understand my YouTube career


27
0:1:23,66 --> 0:1:26,126
and what it's all about.


28
0:1:26,126 --> 0:1:29,59
It always seems like I stay in
a hotel near a cemetery.


29
0:1:29,59 --> 0:1:30,57
I don't know why.


30
0:1:30,57 --> 0:1:34,45
But like the last four hotels
I've been in, I come out in


31
0:1:34,45 --> 0:1:37,55
the morning, and it's daylight,
there's a cemetery.


32
0:1:37,55 --> 0:1:39,68
I don't know if God's trying
to tell me something.


33
0:1:39,68 --> 0:1:43,67
But either way, Lake George,
New York, just


34
0:1:43,67 --> 0:1:44,92
spreading the word.


35
0:1:44,92 --> 0:2:3,55



36
0:2:3,55 --> 0:2:5,83
We had a great house,
great family.


37
0:2:5,83 --> 0:2:8,77
My father and mom had me
and my two brothers.


38
0:2:8,77 --> 0:2:9,74
Really good times.


39
0:2:9,74 --> 0:2:12,92
And then just things started
changing in the house.


40
0:2:12,92 --> 0:2:15,15
My father wasn't home
every night.


41
0:2:15,15 --> 0:2:17,3
And eventually there was
a for sale sign out.


42
0:2:17,3 --> 0:2:19,65
And we went from a nice,
everybody had their own


43
0:2:19,65 --> 0:2:24,61
bedroom, to like a one-bedroom
with my mom who literally just


44
0:2:24,61 --> 0:2:27,45
started drinking from
all the problems.


45
0:2:27,45 --> 0:2:30,19
It's been about 35 years.


46
0:2:30,19 --> 0:2:32,54
Nothing's changed.


47
0:2:32,54 --> 0:2:34,5
We just bounced from apartment
to apartment.


48
0:2:34,5 --> 0:2:38,83
Because me and my brothers were
so crazy that literally


49
0:2:38,83 --> 0:2:41,98
landlords would just say, you're
a great lady, but your


50
0:2:41,98 --> 0:2:43,23
kids are psycho.


51
0:2:43,23 --> 0:2:47,705



52
0:2:47,705 --> 0:2:48,82
What's going on, buddy?


53
0:2:48,82 --> 0:2:50,59
MIKE: How you doing?


54
0:2:50,59 --> 0:2:53,33
SHOENICE: I used to live
here as a kid.


55
0:2:53,33 --> 0:2:56,41
Now I'm famous on YouTube, so
we're doing a documentary


56
0:2:56,41 --> 0:2:57,58
about my life.


57
0:2:57,58 --> 0:2:58,885
My name's Chris, by the way.


58
0:2:58,885 --> 0:2:59,72
Nice to meet you.


59
0:2:59,72 --> 0:3:0,97
You own this property?


60
0:3:0,97 --> 0:3:5,3



61
0:3:5,3 --> 0:3:7,7
SHOENICE: Yeah, we played
around the garage.


62
0:3:7,7 --> 0:3:8,5
I just always remember
we weren't


63
0:3:8,5 --> 0:3:9,1
supposed to go somewhere.


64
0:3:9,1 --> 0:3:11,83
And finally the landlord, maybe
it's the one who owned


65
0:3:11,83 --> 0:3:14,48
it, and just said listen, you
got three great sons, but


66
0:3:14,48 --> 0:3:14,88
they're animals.


67
0:3:14,88 --> 0:3:16,5
You got to move out.


68
0:3:16,5 --> 0:3:19,38
We weren't bad kids, but we just
spray painted the sides


69
0:3:19,38 --> 0:3:20,37
of people's houses.


70
0:3:20,37 --> 0:3:21,14
We don't know why.


71
0:3:21,14 --> 0:3:21,83
We were only seven.


72
0:3:21,83 --> 0:3:23,68
But never did anything bad.


73
0:3:23,68 --> 0:3:25,16
It was nice meeting you.


74
0:3:25,16 --> 0:3:25,42
All right.


75
0:3:25,42 --> 0:3:26,67
Take it easy, man.


76
0:3:26,67 --> 0:3:29,47



77
0:3:29,47 --> 0:3:32,88
Oh, the old neighborhood--


78
0:3:32,88 --> 0:3:34,51
never changes.


79
0:3:34,51 --> 0:3:38,61
As far back as I can remember,
I just was always the kid on


80
0:3:38,61 --> 0:3:41,76
the playground or outside
in the yard.


81
0:3:41,76 --> 0:3:43,91
And just everybody in the
neighborhood knew I would eat


82
0:3:43,91 --> 0:3:44,645
crazy things.


83
0:3:44,645 --> 0:3:47,82
So I was eating grass at first,


84
0:3:47,82 --> 0:3:50,1
and I'd swallow pebbles.


85
0:3:50,1 --> 0:3:52,77
Then my home economics class,
I just started eating the


86
0:3:52,77 --> 0:3:54,75
salt, the baking soda.


87
0:3:54,75 --> 0:3:57,65
And actually, it became such
a trending thing in home


88
0:3:57,65 --> 0:4:0,51
economics that they always
knew that our group would


89
0:4:0,51 --> 0:4:2,38
never be able to finish
the cake or


90
0:4:2,38 --> 0:4:3,92
the muffins or whatever.


91
0:4:3,92 --> 0:4:6,35
Because I already ate half
the ingredients.


92
0:4:6,35 --> 0:4:9,14
And then it became just like
something that I knew I could


93
0:4:9,14 --> 0:4:10,63
make money off of.


94
0:4:10,63 --> 0:4:13,4
I got three guys from England
that don't believe I can drink


95
0:4:13,4 --> 0:4:16,72
three bottles of Budweiser with
the tops on them in under


96
0:4:16,72 --> 0:4:18,956
a minute with no hands.


97
0:4:18,956 --> 0:4:24,78
On your mark, get
set, Shoenice!


98
0:4:24,78 --> 0:4:28,95
So I was in a high school with
gangs and the principal got


99
0:4:28,95 --> 0:4:30,2
his ear half cut-off.


100
0:4:30,2 --> 0:4:32,43
So I knew it was time to go.


101
0:4:32,43 --> 0:4:34,49
My mom said, if you want to quit
high school, you have to


102
0:4:34,49 --> 0:4:35,335
join the Army.


103
0:4:35,335 --> 0:4:37,8
And I said, no problem.


104
0:4:37,8 --> 0:4:38,14
So I joined the Army.


105
0:4:38,14 --> 0:4:39,44
I did my basic training.


106
0:4:39,44 --> 0:4:41,42
I did all this other stuff.


107
0:4:41,42 --> 0:4:45,18
Eventually, Baghdad was
being bombed in 1991.


108
0:4:45,18 --> 0:4:46,7
I'm watching it with
my roommates.


109
0:4:46,7 --> 0:4:48,99
Wow, man, they're
tearing shit up.


110
0:4:48,99 --> 0:4:50,24
The phone rings.


111
0:4:50,24 --> 0:4:55,51
Is this Christopher Thomas
Schewe, 097 B, B, B, B, B?


112
0:4:55,51 --> 0:4:57,94
So I knew once they said my
social security number they


113
0:4:57,94 --> 0:4:59,57
were coming off the IOR list.


114
0:4:59,57 --> 0:5:1,82
So I went out there.


115
0:5:1,82 --> 0:5:3,26
I was food supply.


116
0:5:3,26 --> 0:5:6,23
I basically just fed all the
troops food and water as they


117
0:5:6,23 --> 0:5:7,61
came through.


118
0:5:7,61 --> 0:5:10,58
One day there was a sandstorm.


119
0:5:10,58 --> 0:5:12,92
And I found these two little
kids buried in


120
0:5:12,92 --> 0:5:14,19
this little sand dune.


121
0:5:14,19 --> 0:5:17,71
I gave them some ravioli and
Dinty Moore beef stew.


122
0:5:17,71 --> 0:5:20,73
You could see just the energy
come back in them, too.


123
0:5:20,73 --> 0:5:24,82
And just things like that are
why I want to make sure no kid


124
0:5:24,82 --> 0:5:27,37
goes to bed hungry anymore
in the world.


125
0:5:27,37 --> 0:5:31,19
Now the YouTube community has
allowed me to take that next


126
0:5:31,19 --> 0:5:33,87
level into what I've always
believed in-- stopping global


127
0:5:33,87 --> 0:5:35,93
hunger for good.


128
0:5:35,93 --> 0:5:39,43
I'm going to explain to you
something, to everybody, and


129
0:5:39,43 --> 0:5:41,55
this is the way it is.


130
0:5:41,55 --> 0:5:43,9
My mom told me that someday,
Chris, you're


131
0:5:43,9 --> 0:5:45,1
going to save the world.


132
0:5:45,1 --> 0:5:48,152
And she knew it, too, because
that's what I'm going to do.


133
0:5:48,152 --> 0:5:53,7



134
0:5:53,7 --> 0:5:56,76
Actually, my son signed me
up for YouTube when he


135
0:5:56,76 --> 0:5:57,67
was eight years old.


136
0:5:57,67 --> 0:6:0,89
I didn't even know that you
could have a YouTube channel.


137
0:6:0,89 --> 0:6:3,62
So he was actually the one
that signed me up.


138
0:6:3,62 --> 0:6:5,35
And then he said, Dad, the only
way you're really going


139
0:6:5,35 --> 0:6:7,0
to let people know
that you're on


140
0:6:7,0 --> 0:6:8,57
YouTube is to join Facebook.


141
0:6:8,57 --> 0:6:12,92
So once I posted a YouTube in,
and there was 40 views the


142
0:6:12,92 --> 0:6:14,89
next day, I was sold.


143
0:6:14,89 --> 0:6:17,9
I just knew that was the best
advertising for whatever you


144
0:6:17,9 --> 0:6:19,71
wanted to sell or believe in.


145
0:6:19,71 --> 0:6:22,8
When I first did YouTube,
I just did a joke.


146
0:6:22,8 --> 0:6:25,5
It builds up, and people were
suggesting, why don't you do


147
0:6:25,5 --> 0:6:28,36
what you did in high school
at the cafeteria table?


148
0:6:28,36 --> 0:6:31,15
You used to take the toilet
paper, the napkins, and you'd


149
0:6:31,15 --> 0:6:31,8
eat it all.


150
0:6:31,8 --> 0:6:33,67
I go, OK, I'll do that.


151
0:6:33,67 --> 0:6:36,26
So I did a three-part series
where I ate a whole roll of


152
0:6:36,26 --> 0:6:39,27
1,000 sheets of toilet paper
in like 10 minutes.


153
0:6:39,27 --> 0:6:41,56
That literally is
what blew me up.


154
0:6:41,56 --> 0:6:47,7
And all my eating stunts after
Elmer's glue were all requests


155
0:6:47,7 --> 0:6:48,95
from my fans.


156
0:6:48,95 --> 0:6:52,16



157
0:6:52,16 --> 0:6:54,935
Go to my buddy Nathan's
diner, Wakin' Bacon.


158
0:6:54,935 --> 0:6:57,9
I was just here the other day.


159
0:6:57,9 --> 0:6:59,995
I set a new challenge
for his menu.


160
0:6:59,995 --> 0:7:2,52



161
0:7:2,52 --> 0:7:3,97
Hey, there's my buddy Ian!


162
0:7:3,97 --> 0:7:5,31
We know everybody in the town.


163
0:7:5,31 --> 0:7:8,38
How you doing, Ian?


164
0:7:8,38 --> 0:7:10,21
I'm going to come have
some breakfast.


165
0:7:10,21 --> 0:7:10,95
How you doing?


166
0:7:10,95 --> 0:7:11,385
IAN: Awesome.


167
0:7:11,385 --> 0:7:12,52
SHOENICE: All right.


168
0:7:12,52 --> 0:7:14,75
What are you looking at?


169
0:7:14,75 --> 0:7:15,41
[INAUDIBLE]


170
0:7:15,41 --> 0:7:16,73
a [INAUDIBLE] drive by.


171
0:7:16,73 --> 0:7:17,26
We just kid around.


172
0:7:17,26 --> 0:7:21,44
The town knows us around here
that we don't play games.


173
0:7:21,44 --> 0:7:23,3
Hey everyone, Shoenice again.


174
0:7:23,3 --> 0:7:25,31
Well, basically this
is my first


175
0:7:25,31 --> 0:7:28,17
interview as a famous YouTuber--


176
0:7:28,17 --> 0:7:32,8
glazed420, otherwise
known as Ian.


177
0:7:32,8 --> 0:7:33,79
Dude's no joke.


178
0:7:33,79 --> 0:7:35,375
Helped me out a lot,
he's my friend.


179
0:7:35,375 --> 0:7:43,6



180
0:7:43,6 --> 0:7:49,545
IAN: And then I found out that
he was in [INAUDIBLE]


181
0:7:49,545 --> 0:7:51,16
or something.


182
0:7:51,16 --> 0:7:54,41
He's walking down Lake
George, the road.


183
0:7:54,41 --> 0:7:56,326
And I'm like Shoenice!


184
0:7:56,326 --> 0:7:59,2
And then we basically
immediately hit it off.


185
0:7:59,2 --> 0:8:0,47
I have a separate YouTube.


186
0:8:0,47 --> 0:8:2,9
It's called glazed420.


187
0:8:2,9 --> 0:8:6,17
I do things like working out,
because I do calisthenics.


188
0:8:6,17 --> 0:8:9,83
So I'll do like a minute
and a half handstand.


189
0:8:9,83 --> 0:8:11,325
I'll do a bunch of pull-ups.


190
0:8:11,325 --> 0:8:13,71
I do a bunch of goofy videos.


191
0:8:13,71 --> 0:8:18,28
I have one that's pretty viral
where I'm getting tased by a


192
0:8:18,28 --> 0:8:20,59
cop at a fish show.


193
0:8:20,59 --> 0:8:45,66
The video went viral-- has
about 40,000 views.


194
0:8:45,66 --> 0:8:46,62
SHOENICE: I can't
do it anymore!


195
0:8:46,62 --> 0:8:47,556
I can't do it!


196
0:8:47,556 --> 0:8:48,552
I can't do it, Ian!


197
0:8:48,552 --> 0:8:49,548
I can't do it!


198
0:8:49,548 --> 0:8:50,46
Thank you.


199
0:8:50,46 --> 0:8:51,296
Thank you.


200
0:8:51,296 --> 0:8:56,52



201
0:8:56,52 --> 0:8:59,3
Took the breath right
out of me.


202
0:8:59,3 --> 0:9:2,384
I might have looked like a
little bitch, but you do it.


203
0:9:2,384 --> 0:9:11,78



204
0:9:11,78 --> 0:9:15,85
Oh my God, my room keys
are in my pants, bro.


205
0:9:15,85 --> 0:9:16,77
JIM: I've known Chris
for years.


206
0:9:16,77 --> 0:9:18,1
On and off for 11 years.


207
0:9:18,1 --> 0:9:20,54
And he just recently started
staying at the motel and


208
0:9:20,54 --> 0:9:24,28
telling me of his success
on YouTube.


209
0:9:24,28 --> 0:9:26,105
People just living
at the hotel, it


210
0:9:26,105 --> 0:9:27,22
don't happen too often.


211
0:9:27,22 --> 0:9:29,255
We're against it.


212
0:9:29,255 --> 0:9:32,6
But Chris can stay here
any time right now.


213
0:9:32,6 --> 0:9:34,55
Because he'll bring a smile
to my face when I'm


214
0:9:34,55 --> 0:9:34,84
having a bad day.


215
0:9:34,84 --> 0:9:36,936
You can't go wrong with that.


216
0:9:36,936 --> 0:9:41,73
IAN: With Shoenice, his style on
YouTube, he likes it to be


217
0:9:41,73 --> 0:9:43,25
very simple.


218
0:9:43,25 --> 0:9:47,72
He doesn't want any intro with
the letterheads and all that.


219
0:9:47,72 --> 0:9:49,705
He wants it simple and
down to the point.


220
0:9:49,705 --> 0:9:50,74
SHOENICE: All right, all right.


221
0:9:50,74 --> 0:9:51,97
I'm ready.


222
0:9:51,97 --> 0:9:54,782
Let's eat some glue today.


223
0:9:54,782 --> 0:9:55,95
Hey, everyone.


224
0:9:55,95 --> 0:9:57,18
Shoenice again.


225
0:9:57,18 --> 0:9:59,73
Well, basically, you're probably
wondering why I'm


226
0:9:59,73 --> 0:10:1,92
wearing a microphone
right now.


227
0:10:1,92 --> 0:10:5,43
Well, the Vice documentary crew,
they actually showed up


228
0:10:5,43 --> 0:10:6,5
here today.


229
0:10:6,5 --> 0:10:8,0
And they're videotaping
me right now.


230
0:10:8,0 --> 0:10:10,16
And we got my man Dan.


231
0:10:10,16 --> 0:10:13,2
He's got a bottle of wood glue,
and he's going to open


232
0:10:13,2 --> 0:10:16,2
up the top and he's going
to pour it in my mouth.


233
0:10:16,2 --> 0:10:20,13
Somebody's actually
testing it out.


234
0:10:20,13 --> 0:10:21,8
DAN: Yeah.


235
0:10:21,8 --> 0:10:22,75
SHOENICE: It's glue.


236
0:10:22,75 --> 0:10:23,69
I love you, bro.


237
0:10:23,69 --> 0:10:27,625
On your mark, get set, don't
kill me, Shoenice.


238
0:10:27,625 --> 0:10:34,29



239
0:10:34,29 --> 0:10:38,1
All right, keep going, bro.


240
0:10:38,1 --> 0:10:39,97
Uh huh, all right, go.


241
0:10:39,97 --> 0:10:41,26
Oh man, is it almost done?


242
0:10:41,26 --> 0:10:42,51
DAN: Uh uh.


243
0:10:42,51 --> 0:10:45,32
SHOENICE: Oh, God.


244
0:10:45,32 --> 0:10:46,83
Oh man, not in the face, bro!


245
0:10:46,83 --> 0:10:48,145
Now [INAUDIBLE] is going
to want my job!


246
0:10:48,145 --> 0:10:50,42
I got to go out later!


247
0:10:50,42 --> 0:10:51,67
Hold on.


248
0:10:51,67 --> 0:10:54,386



249
0:10:54,386 --> 0:10:58,17
It's coming out of
my nose, hold on.


250
0:10:58,17 --> 0:11:0,19
Water's for pussies,
but glue isn't.


251
0:11:0,19 --> 0:11:0,87
All right, man.


252
0:11:0,87 --> 0:11:2,12
Let's finish this up, bro.


253
0:11:2,12 --> 0:11:5,78



254
0:11:5,78 --> 0:11:7,1
OK, I'd say it's good enough.


255
0:11:7,1 --> 0:11:8,48
I'd say that's good
enough, don't you?


256
0:11:8,48 --> 0:11:9,559
DAN: Yeah.


257
0:11:9,559 --> 0:11:11,555
SHOENICE: Time.


258
0:11:11,555 --> 0:11:13,551
Time.


259
0:11:13,551 --> 0:11:15,152
Thank you.


260
0:11:15,152 --> 0:11:15,995
Bomb.


261
0:11:15,995 --> 0:11:17,81
That's how we do
a Shoenice vid.


262
0:11:17,81 --> 0:11:19,44
I'm going to go clean
myself up.


263
0:11:19,44 --> 0:11:27,3



264
0:11:27,3 --> 0:11:28,39
How you doing?


265
0:11:28,39 --> 0:11:31,475
Either way, basically what I
do is medicinal marijuana.


266
0:11:31,475 --> 0:11:33,71
I've got Crohn's disease.


267
0:11:33,71 --> 0:11:38,8
So either way, this is what I do
for my medications instead


268
0:11:38,8 --> 0:11:40,59
of spending thousands of dollars
on medicines that give


269
0:11:40,59 --> 0:11:43,33
you more side effects than the
actual Crohn's disease.


270
0:11:43,33 --> 0:11:46,5
And I've been in remission
for 25 years just smoking


271
0:11:46,5 --> 0:11:48,9
something that comes
out of the ground.


272
0:11:48,9 --> 0:11:50,795
So either way, how you doing?


273
0:11:50,795 --> 0:11:54,52



274
0:11:54,52 --> 0:11:57,66
A lot of people probably don't
like me smoking weed and doing


275
0:11:57,66 --> 0:11:59,14
videos for teenage kids.


276
0:11:59,14 --> 0:12:1,81
But I'd rather see a kid
smoke a tree than get


277
0:12:1,81 --> 0:12:2,96
wrapped around one.


278
0:12:2,96 --> 0:12:5,2
Let's get rid of the alcohol,
you know what I mean?


279
0:12:5,2 --> 0:12:11,605
But then the prisons would
be only about 30% full.


280
0:12:11,605 --> 0:12:14,11
This is one of my secrets.


281
0:12:14,11 --> 0:12:19,34
Cranberry juice solves
all problems.


282
0:12:19,34 --> 0:12:25,23
All right, all right, let's get
this loaded up to YouTube.


283
0:12:25,23 --> 0:12:32,3
Vice documentary on location.


284
0:12:32,3 --> 0:12:35,1
When I started YouTube, I never
had an enemy in my life.


285
0:12:35,1 --> 0:12:36,66
So I don't know what
it was like to


286
0:12:36,66 --> 0:12:37,97
be like a Rush Limbaugh.


287
0:12:37,97 --> 0:12:40,9
Like all these people
just hate you.


288
0:12:40,9 --> 0:12:42,98
A lot of people argue
between each other


289
0:12:42,98 --> 0:12:43,98
on my comment boards.


290
0:12:43,98 --> 0:12:46,0
I mean, I'll go back the next
day, and they've literally


291
0:12:46,0 --> 0:12:49,86
argued for hours on end over
the most stupidest things.


292
0:12:49,86 --> 0:12:52,19
Let me just get a feel for what
the people are saying in


293
0:12:52,19 --> 0:12:52,94
the comment board.


294
0:12:52,94 --> 0:12:55,51
I don't think it's going to be
anything other than oh my God,


295
0:12:55,51 --> 0:12:57,8
this is incredible.


296
0:12:57,8 --> 0:12:57,94
Bad ass, you.


297
0:12:57,94 --> 0:13:0,56
This is the only time I'm going
to say first is best,


298
0:13:0,56 --> 0:13:2,235
love the behind the
scenes, Shoenice.


299
0:13:2,235 --> 0:13:4,73
Vice has sunk to a new low.


300
0:13:4,73 --> 0:13:7,25
Blah, whatever.


301
0:13:7,25 --> 0:13:9,93
These are just people that fight
over first, actually.


302
0:13:9,93 --> 0:13:11,9
You look so fucking
baked, haha.


303
0:13:11,9 --> 0:13:14,96
Awesome, haha, it sounds like
you're really enjoying it.


304
0:13:14,96 --> 0:13:17,69
I just think that there's a lot
of people out there that


305
0:13:17,69 --> 0:13:19,1
are just jealous of me.


306
0:13:19,1 --> 0:13:22,73



307
0:13:22,73 --> 0:13:25,69
They want to sit at home
and to do what they do.


308
0:13:25,69 --> 0:13:27,54
I get bottles of liquor
sent to me.


309
0:13:27,54 --> 0:13:29,71
And I get drunk, and
I get paid for it.


310
0:13:29,71 --> 0:13:32,28
It's fun to troll.


311
0:13:32,28 --> 0:13:33,88
IAN: Don't feed the troll.


312
0:13:33,88 --> 0:13:34,83
Don't feed the troll.


313
0:13:34,83 --> 0:13:35,75
But that's what I'm saying.


314
0:13:35,75 --> 0:13:41,63
SHOENICE: Trolling means you
say or do things to get a


315
0:13:41,63 --> 0:13:44,25
negative reaction
out of someone.


316
0:13:44,25 --> 0:13:46,29
You're just trying to say
something just to get them


317
0:13:46,29 --> 0:13:48,3
irked, you know what I mean?


318
0:13:48,3 --> 0:13:49,3
You want one of these?


319
0:13:49,3 --> 0:13:50,22
-Sure.


320
0:13:50,22 --> 0:13:51,56
SHOENICE: You want to eat one?


321
0:13:51,56 --> 0:13:51,94
-Yeah.


322
0:13:51,94 --> 0:13:52,33
SHOENICE: Really?


323
0:13:52,33 --> 0:13:52,595
-Yeah.


324
0:13:52,595 --> 0:13:53,16
SHOENICE: You're going
to eat one.


325
0:13:53,16 --> 0:13:53,46
-Yeah.


326
0:13:53,46 --> 0:13:55,34
SHOENICE: You're going
to eat one with me?


327
0:13:55,34 --> 0:13:56,74
I'm not opening it.


328
0:13:56,74 --> 0:13:58,43
Oh, you got sugar porn
on your lap.


329
0:13:58,43 --> 0:14:0,13
I'm going like this.


330
0:14:0,13 --> 0:14:1,93
-Oh, no!


331
0:14:1,93 --> 0:14:2,38
OK.


332
0:14:2,38 --> 0:14:4,27
SHOENICE: Well you can't
eat them-- it keeps


333
0:14:4,27 --> 0:14:6,51
all the sugar together.


334
0:14:6,51 --> 0:14:9,37
Some people have made these
fake rest in peace videos.


335
0:14:9,37 --> 0:14:13,18
Like, my brother died trying
to-- and it hurts me.


336
0:14:13,18 --> 0:14:16,355
I'm saving a billion children
before my heart stops beating.


337
0:14:16,355 --> 0:14:21,24
So if we lose one to a tampon
stunt, I just call collateral


338
0:14:21,24 --> 0:14:23,7
damage to be honest with you.


339
0:14:23,7 --> 0:14:26,59
Everybody tries to impersonate
their heroes sometime.


340
0:14:26,59 --> 0:14:31,16
And I just have over 5,000
parody vids of people either


341
0:14:31,16 --> 0:14:35,42
hating me, imitating me--


342
0:14:35,42 --> 0:14:37,4
-Shoenice here again.


343
0:14:37,4 --> 0:14:38,655
SHOENICE: Attempting
my stunts.


344
0:14:38,655 --> 0:14:41,48



345
0:14:41,48 --> 0:14:42,59
Just shouting me out.


346
0:14:42,59 --> 0:14:44,98
Or literally they just want
to find me and kill me.


347
0:14:44,98 --> 0:14:46,97
I don't understand.


348
0:14:46,97 --> 0:14:48,486
-Shoenice is a fake,
everybody.


349
0:14:48,486 --> 0:14:51,12
I just want you guys
to know that.


350
0:14:51,12 --> 0:14:54,13
SHOENICE: I took all the beer
out of my fridge on the 4th of


351
0:14:54,13 --> 0:14:58,65
July, and I went straight
for six years.


352
0:14:58,65 --> 0:14:59,82
And then I started
doing YouTube.


353
0:14:59,82 --> 0:15:2,34
I was still straight.


354
0:15:2,34 --> 0:15:5,11
My ex-wife couldn't
handle the fame.


355
0:15:5,11 --> 0:15:6,73
So she's like, you've
got to go, and I


356
0:15:6,73 --> 0:15:8,34
moved out to the garage.


357
0:15:8,34 --> 0:15:11,41
You can see how I have
some garage vids.


358
0:15:11,41 --> 0:15:14,69
And then I just eventually
just left the property.


359
0:15:14,69 --> 0:15:17,1
And I knew I wasn't putting
my son to bed that


360
0:15:17,1 --> 0:15:21,19
night, so time to drink.


361
0:15:21,19 --> 0:15:24,641
On your mark, get set.


362
0:15:24,641 --> 0:15:28,92



363
0:15:28,92 --> 0:15:29,342
Everclear.


364
0:15:29,342 --> 0:15:35,5



365
0:15:35,5 --> 0:15:38,78
Because that's the only reason
why I put the bottle down, is


366
0:15:38,78 --> 0:15:40,73
for family.


367
0:15:40,73 --> 0:15:44,443
So without them, I was
chaotic again.


368
0:15:44,443 --> 0:15:52,23



369
0:15:52,23 --> 0:15:53,95
I was homeless for a while.


370
0:15:53,95 --> 0:15:55,5
I did Matchbook stunts.


371
0:15:55,5 --> 0:15:58,79
On your mark, get
set, Shoenice!


372
0:15:58,79 --> 0:15:59,274
Hard!


373
0:15:59,274 --> 0:16:0,726
-Look at his tongue.


374
0:16:0,726 --> 0:16:1,976
-I'm all ready.


375
0:16:1,976 --> 0:16:5,566



376
0:16:5,566 --> 0:16:7,99
SHOENICE: Ha ha, hee
haw, bitches!


377
0:16:7,99 --> 0:16:9,39
Every bar banned me.


378
0:16:9,39 --> 0:16:11,616
I mean, I literally couldn't
go anywhere.


379
0:16:11,616 --> 0:16:12,98
Hello, everybody.


380
0:16:12,98 --> 0:16:13,81
Shut up.


381
0:16:13,81 --> 0:16:15,3
This is Shoenice22.


382
0:16:15,3 --> 0:16:17,76
I'm going to eat a tampon
in under a minute, bro.


383
0:16:17,76 --> 0:16:20,31
I've always been used to
living under a roof.


384
0:16:20,31 --> 0:16:23,82
So when I was like thrown out,
there was nothing I could do.


385
0:16:23,82 --> 0:16:26,29
I couldn't get to my bank
account or whatever.


386
0:16:26,29 --> 0:16:29,58
But I had that specialty of just
freaking out people on


387
0:16:29,58 --> 0:16:30,525
the street.


388
0:16:30,525 --> 0:16:33,56
And I could go into a bar flat
broke, and I'd walk out with


389
0:16:33,56 --> 0:16:36,34
$400 drunk as a skunk
an hour later.


390
0:16:36,34 --> 0:16:39,11
So it worked for me, but there's
people out there that


391
0:16:39,11 --> 0:16:42,5
don't have my talent,
you know?


392
0:16:42,5 --> 0:16:43,65
I met this hotel owner that was


393
0:16:43,65 --> 0:16:45,27
rehabbing all these hotels.


394
0:16:45,27 --> 0:16:49,335
He actually fed me, gave me
a place to do my laundry.


395
0:16:49,335 --> 0:17:14,4



396
0:17:14,4 --> 0:17:16,94
JIM: Yeah, he borrowed my
car, went to the store.


397
0:17:16,94 --> 0:17:20,51
And comes back and it's full of
gas, and gave me money, and


398
0:17:20,51 --> 0:17:21,3
this and that.


399
0:17:21,3 --> 0:17:23,359
I mean, he's got a big heart.


400
0:17:23,359 --> 0:17:24,849
He likes to make people
happy, I guess.


401
0:17:24,849 --> 0:17:26,653
SHOENICE: Basically, I'm
going to save the


402
0:17:26,653 --> 0:17:28,6
whole country of Africa.


403
0:17:28,6 --> 0:17:29,7
So we're going to
start practicing


404
0:17:29,7 --> 0:17:31,808
doing donation drive-bys.


405
0:17:31,808 --> 0:17:34,2
These people never seen us
before behind us, and we're


406
0:17:34,2 --> 0:17:36,695
going to go surprise this one
lady with a $20 bill.


407
0:17:36,695 --> 0:17:37,685
-You're not a--


408
0:17:37,685 --> 0:17:38,18
SHOENICE: I'm serious.


409
0:17:38,18 --> 0:17:39,41
I make money off of Google.


410
0:17:39,41 --> 0:17:41,91
I know what it's like
to be homeless.


411
0:17:41,91 --> 0:17:43,66
I'm not saying you are,
but what we do


412
0:17:43,66 --> 0:17:45,41
is we help out people.


413
0:17:45,41 --> 0:17:50,5
All I had was a $20 on me, but
this guy Ian, my cameraman, is


414
0:17:50,5 --> 0:17:50,773
very friendly.


415
0:17:50,773 --> 0:17:51,5
-Is this going to be on TV?


416
0:17:51,5 --> 0:17:54,67
SHOENICE: I've been on "Tosh.0,"
"World's Dumbest." I


417
0:17:54,67 --> 0:17:57,1
mean, I'm just a crazy fella.


418
0:17:57,1 --> 0:18:0,14
Hey, we were so poor growing
up, my mom used to say, you


419
0:18:0,14 --> 0:18:2,35
better finish everything
on your plate.


420
0:18:2,35 --> 0:18:4,976
There's people right now
starving in the living room.


421
0:18:4,976 --> 0:18:8,7



422
0:18:8,7 --> 0:18:10,68
Get it?


423
0:18:10,68 --> 0:18:14,67
I think my mom was just a woman
that just was too young


424
0:18:14,67 --> 0:18:18,3
to have three sons on her own.


425
0:18:18,3 --> 0:18:20,61
Eventually alcohol took over.


426
0:18:20,61 --> 0:18:23,89
And literally it would
be like she would go


427
0:18:23,89 --> 0:18:25,92
out on a Friday night.


428
0:18:25,92 --> 0:18:28,89
She wouldn't want to, you know,
forget about her kids.


429
0:18:28,89 --> 0:18:30,94
But she would go into
a blackout.


430
0:18:30,94 --> 0:18:34,6
Obviously, go somewhere
other than her home.


431
0:18:34,6 --> 0:18:36,3
And then the neighbors were
wondering when she'd pull in


432
0:18:36,3 --> 0:18:38,79
like the next afternoon.


433
0:18:38,79 --> 0:18:42,65
I always was able to suffice
when we didn't


434
0:18:42,65 --> 0:18:44,44
have food in the house.


435
0:18:44,44 --> 0:18:48,5
If you didn't have a Miracle
Whip sandwich, I'd just take


436
0:18:48,5 --> 0:18:51,83
some sheets off the
toilet paper roll.


437
0:18:51,83 --> 0:18:53,74
I think I still do
it to this day.


438
0:18:53,74 --> 0:18:54,72
It fills your belly.


439
0:18:54,72 --> 0:19:0,962
But my father eventually came
and got us, and times went on.


440
0:19:0,962 --> 0:19:4,4
See, I don't like to hang
out with drunk people.


441
0:19:4,4 --> 0:19:6,21
My mother was a chronic
alcoholic.


442
0:19:6,21 --> 0:19:7,28
She was a great lady.


443
0:19:7,28 --> 0:19:11,63
But when I found her dead at 56
on the living room floor, I


444
0:19:11,63 --> 0:19:13,14
knew she was out
of her misery.


445
0:19:13,14 --> 0:19:16,94
Because she lived
off of vodka.


446
0:19:16,94 --> 0:19:19,5
I guess that's where I get
my liquor slamming


447
0:19:19,5 --> 0:19:21,4
stunts from, you know?


448
0:19:21,4 --> 0:19:26,66
My mom always had that big
bottle of vodka, right


449
0:19:26,66 --> 0:19:29,23
underneath the kitchen sink
next to the dish soap.


450
0:19:29,23 --> 0:19:32,88



451
0:19:32,88 --> 0:19:35,29
I thought it was normal to
go to eighth grade in


452
0:19:35,29 --> 0:19:36,46
a blackout by lunch.


453
0:19:36,46 --> 0:19:41,18
I mean, we just used to take
the whole glass of vodka to


454
0:19:41,18 --> 0:19:42,4
the bus stop.


455
0:19:42,4 --> 0:19:45,702
We'd all pass it around
and go to school.


456
0:19:45,702 --> 0:19:49,7
But it'll catch up
to you someday.


457
0:19:49,7 --> 0:19:52,1
It'll catch up to me.


458
0:19:52,1 --> 0:19:57,9
They sent me a bottle of Devil's
Springs, 160 proof--


459
0:19:57,9 --> 0:19:59,8
30 proof less.


460
0:19:59,8 --> 0:20:1,31
Now, what I'm going to
do is talk to you


461
0:20:1,31 --> 0:20:2,94
before I slam this bottle.


462
0:20:2,94 --> 0:20:4,46
Nothing's fake about this.


463
0:20:4,46 --> 0:20:7,48
I just have a really crazy
tolerance for liquor.


464
0:20:7,48 --> 0:20:9,86
The Devil's Springs was
kind of freaky--


465
0:20:9,86 --> 0:20:11,14
160 proof.


466
0:20:11,14 --> 0:20:12,55
My friends were there.


467
0:20:12,55 --> 0:20:16,45
I kind of like was lethargic
and passing out, and they


468
0:20:16,45 --> 0:20:17,2
couldn't wake me up.


469
0:20:17,2 --> 0:20:19,6
So I woke up actually with
a tube down my throat.


470
0:20:19,6 --> 0:20:22,26
It's the only time I've ever
had my stomach pumped.


471
0:20:22,26 --> 0:20:24,18
And to be honest with
you, I was mad.


472
0:20:24,18 --> 0:20:26,22
Because I didn't have insurance,
and I knew that


473
0:20:26,22 --> 0:20:32,366
tube down my throat was about
a $400 procedure.


474
0:20:32,366 --> 0:20:34,97
Alcohol leads to bad stuff.


475
0:20:34,97 --> 0:20:38,77
The only two times I ever smoked
crack in my life was


476
0:20:38,77 --> 0:20:39,615
when I was drunk.


477
0:20:39,615 --> 0:20:43,52
I would never even think about
walking down the street


478
0:20:43,52 --> 0:20:48,336
looking for a bump at 4:00 in
the morning going like this.


479
0:20:48,336 --> 0:20:52,4
IAN: When Shoenice chugs bottles
of liquor, I feel


480
0:20:52,4 --> 0:20:53,96
concerned for his health.


481
0:20:53,96 --> 0:20:57,38
I don't want to see the guy end
up dying from one of his


482
0:20:57,38 --> 0:20:59,4
drinking stunts.


483
0:20:59,4 --> 0:21:2,4
And I showed my concern, and a
bunch of people on Facebook


484
0:21:2,4 --> 0:21:5,2
and YouTube have showed
the concern.


485
0:21:5,2 --> 0:21:9,96
So he did one stunt with a
bottle of Everclear to end all


486
0:21:9,96 --> 0:21:11,21
the drinking stunts.


487
0:21:11,21 --> 0:21:13,61



488
0:21:13,61 --> 0:21:15,65
He defeats death in a way.


489
0:21:15,65 --> 0:21:16,39
You know what I mean?


490
0:21:16,39 --> 0:21:18,76
Because some of this stuff,
normal people


491
0:21:18,76 --> 0:21:20,2
would die from it.


492
0:21:20,2 --> 0:21:24,88
And it's just like people
like that about


493
0:21:24,88 --> 0:21:26,205
death-defying things.


494
0:21:26,205 --> 0:21:30,14
And like wow, he must be
some kind of mutant.


495
0:21:30,14 --> 0:21:33,22
There's something special about
Shoenice where he can


496
0:21:33,22 --> 0:21:34,795
handle that kind of stuff.


497
0:21:34,795 --> 0:21:37,96
JIM: It's hard for anybody to
hear, but then there's smokers


498
0:21:37,96 --> 0:21:39,55
and stuff like that.


499
0:21:39,55 --> 0:21:41,65
Life is full of choices, and
he's making a choice.


500
0:21:41,65 --> 0:21:43,74
And do I agree with it?


501
0:21:43,74 --> 0:21:44,1
No.


502
0:21:44,1 --> 0:21:46,88
But it's getting him somewhere,
isn't it?


503
0:21:46,88 --> 0:21:47,54
Would I do it?


504
0:21:47,54 --> 0:21:48,2
No.


505
0:21:48,2 --> 0:21:51,5
But people do anything
for money, they say.


506
0:21:51,5 --> 0:21:55,255
So if he's getting a little
money out of it, that's why


507
0:21:55,255 --> 0:21:58,472
he's eating glue, and tampons,
and everything else.


508
0:21:58,472 --> 0:22:2,22
SHOENICE: And what I do is I'm
basically trying to figure out


509
0:22:2,22 --> 0:22:6,42
who can really handle being
a part of my revolution.


510
0:22:6,42 --> 0:22:11,87
I got Muslims hanging out with
whites from southern Alabama.


511
0:22:11,87 --> 0:22:13,78
I mean, I've literally had
people coming and going


512
0:22:13,78 --> 0:22:15,8
Shoenice, you saved
me from a suicide.


513
0:22:15,8 --> 0:22:19,35
You brought us back together
as a couple.


514
0:22:19,35 --> 0:22:23,24
And it's just, you're in our
lives now, don't never leave.


515
0:22:23,24 --> 0:22:25,41
Stop all the craziness,
because you


516
0:22:25,41 --> 0:22:26,42
will save the world.


517
0:22:26,42 --> 0:22:29,4
So I mean, I'm a lot of
people's higher power.


518
0:22:29,4 --> 0:22:30,64
I'm their antidepressant.


519
0:22:30,64 --> 0:22:33,79
It's just like, where's
it going to lead to?


520
0:22:33,79 --> 0:22:35,4
It scares me sometimes.


521
0:22:35,4 --> 0:22:49,832



522
0:22:49,832 --> 0:22:53,11
SHOENICE: I'm hoping I can stop
global hunger in three


523
0:22:53,11 --> 0:22:57,1
years because I'm
getting tired.


524
0:22:57,1 --> 0:22:59,78
But if I die, I know
that there'll be


525
0:22:59,78 --> 0:23:0,9
people that carry on.


526
0:23:0,9 --> 0:23:4,886
I'll be a better martyr and a
better human on this planet,


527
0:23:4,886 --> 0:23:6,374
that's a guarantee.


528
0:23:6,374 --> 0:23:9,35



529
0:23:9,35 --> 0:23:11,334
Shoenice!


530
0:23:11,334 --> 0:23:15,302
Na, ha, ha, hee haw, bitches!


531
0:23:15,302 --> 0:23:17,782
I own this town!


532
0:23:17,782 --> 0:23:18,98
You heard me.


533
0:23:18,98 --> 0:23:22,66
Trying to play dead
in the cemetery.


534
0:23:22,66 --> 0:23:23,34
All right.


535
0:23:23,34 --> 0:23:24,97
It's a nice day.


536
0:23:24,97 --> 0:23:30,435



537
0:23:30,435 --> 0:23:30,93
[BEEP]


538
0:23:30,93 --> 0:23:33,39
SHOENICE: Hi, Aaron,
it's Shoenice.


539
0:23:33,39 --> 0:23:35,29
Great job on the documentary.


540
0:23:35,29 --> 0:23:36,78
I loved everything.


541
0:23:36,78 --> 0:23:39,85
One thing I would like to take
back that I said though, is


542
0:23:39,85 --> 0:23:43,99
that if a child died imitating
one of my stunts on YouTube it


543
0:23:43,99 --> 0:23:47,42
would be collateral damage
towards my revolution.


544
0:23:47,42 --> 0:23:49,71
Actually, I would like
to take that back.


545
0:23:49,71 --> 0:23:53,236
It would be devastating to me
just for me to even think that


546
0:23:53,236 --> 0:23:58,63
I had any possibility in the
way of somebody dying.


547
0:23:58,63 --> 0:24:2,18
So, yeah, I appreciate you
doing my life story.


548
0:24:2,18 --> 0:24:4,98
It should help me out a lot
with my hunger campaign.


549
0:24:4,98 --> 0:24:8,4
But that was just the one thing
I really wish I could


550
0:24:8,4 --> 0:24:11,15
stick my foot in my mouth
on is that comment about


551
0:24:11,15 --> 0:24:15,82
collateral damage for a teenage
kid to die imitating


552
0:24:15,82 --> 0:24:17,7
one of my stunts.


553
0:24:17,7 --> 0:24:19,3
Because that would literally
break my heart.


554
0:24:19,3 --> 0:24:19,71
OK.


555
0:24:19,71 --> 0:24:20,8
Thanks, Aaron.


556
0:24:20,8 --> 0:24:23,66
But if you keep it in, that's
no problem either.


557
0:24:23,66 --> 0:24:25,46
Documentary's a documentary.


558
0:24:25,46 --> 0:24:27,78
Ba, ha, ha, ha, hee haw.


559
0:24:27,78 --> 0:24:29,3
Thank you.


560
0:24:29,3 --> 0:26:29,3
