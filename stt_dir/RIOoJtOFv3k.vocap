###18 GREG HUNT: Well, I mean, Dylan's like so good.
###22 He can pretty much do what he wants, when he wants.
###25 
###28 I don't know, how in depth you want going to get.
###30 I guess I could say that the first year of Dylan was like
###34 really incredible.
###35 It's like when he got the Year's Best Am
###38 in skateboard MAG.
###39 And every time we'd go out he would get something amazing.
###43 And then the second year, he kind of wasn't
###47 really as on it.
###49 He was just kind of like, whatever man.
###51 He was just being a kid.
###53 He was partying, or whatever, but he wasn't as focused, I
###58 think, as he should have been.
###59 HEATH KIRCHART: We had like an Alien house.
###61 It was me and Greg.
###61 And it was just basically like, to kind of like, get
###66 people motivated to go film together and everything.
###68 And that's when Dylan got on, and he was in [INAUDIBLE]
###72 Beach, kind of not doing much.
###73 So Greg was like, let's get him up here,
###75 get him in the house.
###76 We can go skate all time.
###77 It'll be like good for the video.
###79 We'll get him out, maybe motivate you to go skate and
###82 stuff like that, kind of push each other.
###85 I guess it didn't really work out that way.
###87 DYLAN RIEDER: Yeah, it was a weird, weird scene.
###90 Like I lived in the living room.
###92 All my shit's spread out, fucking like, stay up till
###96 4:00 in the morning, sleep all day.
###98 HEATH KIRCHART: Just clothes everywhere, play guitar at
###101 fucking 3:00 in the morning.
###102 Learning how to play guitar, not even playing, just
###104 learning how to play it.
###106 He would sleep til like 2, 3 o'clock in afternoon, in the
###109 living room, with just like people walking over him and
###112 stuff like that.
###113 And then, just like, hey, we're going filming in an
###116 hour, like get up.
###117 And then just like, no, he just slept.
###121 Having to walk over an 18-year-old kid, in your
###124 living room, to go skate, and wondering why he's not up,
###127 like out there as much as I am.
###130 It just was discouraging.
###131 And, I've just never seen someone so unmotivated.
###134 DYLAN RIEDER: I definitely kind of faded away, for a
###138 little bit.
###139 Kind of got lost in my own head, maybe some other things.
###143 MARK OBLOW: The Alien thing was a starting off of a whole
###147 other side of Dylan.
###148 It was when he really started to get addicted to drugs.
###153 Like, his skating, in my opinion, was like falling.
###157 JASON DILL: Dylan conked out for a while.
###159 He was his own Bad News Bear.
###161 He was fucked up all the time.
###166 He was just doped up.
###169 He was so stupid.
###171 He was stupid.
###173 You couldn't talk to him.
###175 And I thought I was fucked up.
###177 Man, he passed me right by, but he never
###181 had a drinking problem.
###182 MARK OBLOW: I mean, I really was having a hard time with
###185 the whole thing.
###186 I've been with the kid since he's 11.
###188 Like, he's like a son, like a brother, like a friend, all
###191 these things to me.
###193 And I'd go on trips with him and he'd be the kid before
###196 that was like getting all the tricks, boom, boom you'd be
###199 like, all right, you don't need anything of Dylan.
###201 And he'd come on trips, and he wouldn't get anything.
###204 It was literally the last year when everyone was expecting
###208 like all his fucking gnarliest shit, and that's when the year
###215 that it really all took a hold of him and he just fucking
###218 started to just melt.
###221 He started having a hard time when he was in public, like
###225 skating and stuff.
###226 Because he constantly was feeling like
###228 he was being judged.
###229 And there was a point when he came to me and was like, I
###232 want to quit.
###232 I don't want to, I can't handle it anymore.
###235 It's too much.
###238 It was just fuck it.
###239 It all had kind of hit into him at once.
###242 And then, that was his outlet was, pop some pills.
###250 INTERVIEWER: What kind of drugs, like
###251 they were saying pills?
###254 It's up to you, whatever you want to do.
###256 DYLAN RIEDER: No, no it's all good.
###257 I mean fucking pharmaceuticals, man they kind
###259 of fucking solve your problems for the time being.
###261 
###267 Drugs will win in the long run.
###269 I didn't even know what was going on by the time of the
###271 end of video.
###272 I was pretty far gone.
###275 I didn't really care.
###278 I mean I did, but at the same time I was trying to fucking
###286 not think pretty much about anything.
###288 MARK OBLOW: He was that talented that he could pull
###291 off something like that without being at 100%.
###296 But the people that knew his 100% knew that that video was
###302 not even close.
###304 GREG HUNT: And especially towards like the last few
###306 months of filming, like the real critical time, he was
###308 just kind of like not really there.
###310 There's always kind of like an idea of like, hey you know
###313 it'd be good to get like a couple more lines, or like
###315 some tranny stuff would be really cool.
###317 Especially if you're someone young like him and you already
###319 have a good foundation of a [INAUDIBLE]
###321 you can kind of like mold it a little bit.
###326 And he just wasn't really super focused at all.
###329 So, I don't know, it was kind of rough on me, because I had
###331 really, like, high expectations.
###333 And I'm not saying his part isn't good, but he'll admit
###340 this first, he had high expectations too.
###343 And he knew, and in a lot of ways, I think he feels like,
###346 not that he blew it, but he could come through a lot
###349 better than he did.
###349 HEATH KIRCHART: I feel like his part in the Alien video
###351 was good, but like, this is like a kid that's like a real
###354 talent at skating.
###355 And I don't think he lived up to this talent
###357 in that video part.
###359 There were certain people pouring as much as they could
###361 into this video, and then here there was this young kid that
###364 we got to be in the video, to help the
###367 video, just piling out.
###369 I didn't know this, but at the premier, after his part he got
###373 up and just left, just walked out on the video.
###377 Hearing that, I mean there was just numerous things, like, I
###380 don't care if your fucked up on pills, or what, like you
###382 don't go to your fucking video premiere where everyone in
###384 this team worked hard, and walk out after your own part.
###387 Just don't even show up if you're going to do that.
###389 DYLAN RIEDER: Well I went to it.
###391 It was fucked, like I was so out of it.
###394 And I remember there was like no seats.
###395 And I just remember it was like a really weird situation
###398 in my head.
###399 And I guess there was like seats saved for me, but I was
###402 so far gone that I didn't even realize it.
###405 I remember watching my part and then I just left.
###408 And I remember walking down the aisle and seeing Carter,
###410 like that's going to be the only thing I really remember,
###411 like when walking out.
###413 I guess he like super bummed.
###415 INTERVIEWER: He was bummed you left?
###417 DYLAN RIEDER: Like he was pretty pissed off.
###420 INTERVIEWER: Did you ever come out and say shit?
###422 HEATH KIRCHART: I'm not really that type of guy, because like
###424 I just like keep it bottled up, and bottled up, and just
###427 slowly, over time, will just like hate someone.
###430 And just like, be like, all right well fuck that.
###432 I just hate him now.
###434 And that's kind of like the way I went with Dylan.
###438 I just like, this fucking kid, and just like, he would annoy
###440 the fuck out of me.
###443 I just kind of like bottled it all in, and just turned it
###445 into like hatred towards him.
###446 INTERVIEWER: But, supposedly that all ended.
###449 And now he's like--
###449 HEATH KIRCHART: Well, yeah, like that was like, Dylan, I
###451 kind of like, I mean, I was kind of just over the whole
###455 Dylan thing.
###455 Just like, whatever, like he's not that motivated to skate,
###458 and he did a lot of bullshit.
###462 He did a lot bullshit, like walk out on a premier.
###464 You just don't act that way.
###467 But then time went on, and later on I found out that he
###471 had this gnarly pill problem, and
###472 everything, kind of got help.
###475 I think, he got ultimatums from these companies,
###477 basically like listen, like these checks are here, but
###480 their not yours until you clean your act up, you're
###482 done, you're cut off.
###483 MARK OBLOW: We were going to definitely drop him from
###485 Gravis, and drop him from Analog.
###486 Because it was like, we just can't keep this going.
###490 There's always excuses, and it was basically like we tried to
###493 get him to go to rehab that day, and basically he didn't
###498 want to go.
###499 He wanted to try and do it on his own.
###502 And I didn't think he could do it, Moe didn't
###504 think he could do it.
###506 But, the thing with Dylan was he was always like honest and
###509 straight with us, and so he just said, hey, give me six
###512 days and if I can't do it in six days, then
###516 I'll go to a clinic.
###517 So we said fuck, OK.
###520 And no one thought he could do it, but he actually did it.
###524 DYLAN RIEDER: Fuck man, I just got my priorities have changed
###529 since that video.
###532 I'm just more focused on my skating, pretty much.
###535 Like all that shit's in the past that I did.
###539 I really don't even think about it anymore, now it's
###541 like a new chapter for me.
###543 GREG HUNT: And I think that's why now, over the past year,
###547 he's like seriously, like, on a mission.
###551 So I think now he's like super on point.
###554 HEATH KIRCHART: I mean, I went on a trip with him last year,
###556 and completely different guy, 180--
###559 with skating, really motivated, just like, wow,
###562 like, everyone's going to the bar, Dylan's going out with
###566 Greg with the generator and the lights to
###567 try to go film tricks.
###569 I've seen the tricks that he's done.
###571 On that trip, I saw stuff that he did that was like really
###576 impressive, really impressive stuff.
###578 ANTHONY VAN ENGELEN: I don't think in the past six months
###581 there hasn't been a time when we go out, even if it's just a
###582 mellow day, it turns into a gnarly day.
###585 The kick from Smith was just something that
###587 happened one day.
###589 I mean, that's just the testament to what's going on
###591 with him right now, it's just like that's like something
###594 he'll just wake up and run into.
###596 I mean, could you imagine then the shit that he's thinking
###598 about doing?
###599 JASON DILL: What you saw in Minefield great, super sick.
###606 You have no idea.
###607 I mean the kid is just, he's in the window.
###611 Me and Abe talk about the window, 1924
###613 you have this window.
###615 When you're in the window, you can do anything.
###620 BILL STROBECK: Dylan, he's a young, agile, skateboarder.
###625 I mean, he's in his window, for sure.
###627 Like, he's fucking killing it right now.
###629 ATRO SAARI: The last year now that I've seen him skate and
###632 going to [INAUDIBLE] and he's just fucking destroyed it.
###635 Just, fucking manpower, he's not like this
###638 flimsy little guy.
###640 He's just like stylish, fucking buffed out, and is
###643 just ready to kill.
###644 Yeah, he's working on this clip for Gravis.
###648 And I'd say, that's going to be pretty god damn good.
###654 Not a single filler in it.
###657 This stuff was supposed to be kind of the bangers of the
###661 Alien video.
###662 He's catching up on the missing year.
###664 DYLAN RIEDER: Yeah, I'm super stoked in what I have so far,
###667 I mean, fuck it.
###670 It's such a short period of time to do video a parts.
###675 I've been filming with Greg I think a year now.
###678 GREG HUNT: I'd like to think that people's perception of
###680 Dylan is going to change.
###681 Because I think right now, I think people don't really--
###684 I think he's kind of like a little mis-perceived maybe,
###688 you know what I mean?
###689 When this footage comes out, I think it's going to change a
###693 lot of people's minds because it's so good.
###695 And it's not just like he's like technically good, he's
###699 fucking gnarly.
###701 ANTHONY VAN ENGELEN: We all knew what he was capable of,
###703 but now he finally knows.
###706 He always ripped, but now he's fucking gnarly.
###709 And I don't know when this thing comes out, if his thing
###711 will be out, but anybody whose been talking shit, or
###715 whatever, this kid's like fucking tough as nails, Dude.
###719 He's like one of the gnarliest skaters alive right now.
###722 And people will see, just that.
###727 
###734 I don't know, I told them to film for another two years and
###737 make, Dylan the Movie.
###739 They made one of Bruce Irons.
###741 I thought it was sick.
###743 Bruce Irons the Movie.
###744 INTERVIEWER: Who's that?
###745 ANTHONY VAN ENGELEN: Pro surfer, Bruce
###747 Irons, Vulcan made it.
###749 They should make fucking Dylan the Movie.
###751
