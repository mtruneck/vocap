An out-of-this-world theory on how
nothing turned into something, a giant

0:0:5,67 --> 0:0:10,84
fossil human footprint, and we dive into
the mailbox - this is Genesis week.

4
0:0:26,94 --> 0:0:31,4
And a welcome to this episode of Genesis
Week, the weekly program of creationary


5
0:0:31,4 --> 0:0:35,75
commentary on news, views and events
pertaining to the origins controversy,


6
0:0:35,75 --> 0:0:40,42
exclusive right here on youtube.  Still one
of the most discussed videos on youtube


7
0:0:40,42 --> 0:0:44,2
in science & technology, we bring you the
information the anti-creationists don't


8
0:0:44,2 --> 0:0:49,24
want you to see or hear, and we  show the
glory of God in the Creation.

12
0:1:1,24 --> 0:1:7,69
Alan Boyle, of Cosmic log on MSNBC had
an interview with theoretical physicist


13
0:1:7,69 --> 0:1:12,52
Lawrence Krauss.  Krauss, head of the
Origins Project at Arizona State


14
0:1:12,52 --> 0:1:16,98
University, tackled the question of "How
did everything come from nothing?" in his


15
0:1:16,98 --> 0:1:20,15
latest book entitled "A Universe from
Nothing."


16
0:1:20,15 --> 0:1:24,8
So how exactly do you get a universe
from nothing? As Boyle explained it, by


17
0:1:24,8 --> 0:1:30,13
calling upon energy to be converted into
matter - following the suit of Einstein's


18
0:1:30,13 --> 0:1:41,8
relativitistic theory, combined with


19
0:1:41,8 --> 0:1:49,4
That's right, it can work.....if we violate
the laws of physics.  translation: it would


20
0:1:49,4 --> 0:1:50,8
be a miracle.


21
0:1:50,8 --> 0:1:55,38
I admire Krauss's brutal honesty - we
creationists have been pointing out for


22
0:1:55,38 --> 0:2:1,35
decades that the origin of the universe
and life requires a miracle - a defiance of


23
0:2:1,35 --> 0:2:6,17
the laws and nature and physics.
But notice that while they are willing to


24
0:2:6,17 --> 0:2:11,2
accept a miracle, they will not accept the
possibility of a miracle worker - Our


25
0:2:11,2 --> 0:2:12,9
Creator, Jesus Christ?


26
0:2:12,9 --> 0:2:56,19
Krause said:


27
0:2:56,19 --> 0:3:3,3
Wow. One comment on the blog, left by
UnitedStates1776, summed up this utter


28
0:3:3,3 --> 0:3:11,98
nonsense nicely:  "I am possible, therefore
I will be."  Krauss has envisioned a very


29
0:3:11,98 --> 0:3:18,86
introspective universe that needs to plan
ahead in order to even be.  Forget about "I


30
0:3:18,86 --> 0:3:26,15
think, therefore I am" - this is "I will be,
therefore I must think of how I can be, so I


31
0:3:26,15 --> 0:3:29,32
can think."


32
0:3:29,32 --> 0:3:43,44
Krauss defended his position by saying:


33
0:3:43,44 --> 0:3:49,21
Wait a minute! You were talking about a
magical, mystical fantasy land where the


34
0:3:49,21 --> 0:3:53,66
laws of physics are different or perhaps
don't even exist, and now somehow you


35
0:3:53,66 --> 0:3:58,51
think this helps people learn about
reality?


36
0:3:58,51 --> 0:4:2,63
Read the blog post yourself, then tell me
what you think in the comments down


37
0:4:2,63 --> 0:4:6,4
below: Do you think Krauss is on to
something? Or is he perhaps on


38
0:4:6,4 --> 0:4:11,88
something?  Or do you think Krauss
should be on something?


39
0:4:11,88 --> 0:4:16,5
In Jesus' Name Productions is working on
a movie that re-enacts Noah's flood.


40
0:4:16,5 --> 0:4:20,89
Producer Joe Bardwell invited both
Christian old-earth advocates and Young


41
0:4:20,89 --> 0:4:25,24
Earth Christians to present their models
of how Noah's flood happened, or didn't


42
0:4:25,24 --> 0:4:31,23
happen, in a peer-reviewed panel format.
Joe then held a competition for ten people


43
0:4:31,23 --> 0:4:36,32
in a technical review panel, of which I
earned a spot. Our job as the technical


44
0:4:36,32 --> 0:4:41,5
review panel was to rip all of these
models apart, scientifically, if we could.


45
0:4:41,5 --> 0:4:45,51
Several old-earth advocates declined to
participate, but their models and


46
0:4:45,51 --> 0:4:50,2
arguments were scrutinized as
non-responding authors.  Six Young Earth


47
0:4:50,2 --> 0:4:53,65
Creation models; both flood and pre-flood
world models, were defended by their


48
0:4:53,65 --> 0:4:57,84
authors in the technical review.  The
competition and technical review itself


49
0:4:57,84 --> 0:5:2,59
went on for some two years, and the
findings of the review were published in a


50
0:5:2,59 --> 0:5:8,51
massive e-book.  This is a must-read for
anyone interested in geology, flood


51
0:5:8,51 --> 0:5:13,77
geology, Biblical catastrophism,
uniformitarianism, actualism, etc...  The


52
0:5:13,77 --> 0:5:19,31
book is available for instant download for
a donation of your choosing.  If you could


53
0:5:19,31 --> 0:5:23,99
though, please make it a generous
donation, as Joe put tens of thousands of


54
0:5:23,99 --> 0:5:28,42
dollars into this important project.
This book, in my opinion, is going to


55
0:5:28,42 --> 0:5:33,6
impact both the creation and evolution
community as much as the landmark book


56
0:5:33,6 --> 0:5:40,95
"The Genesis Flood."  You can get your
copy here at In Jesus Name Productions.


57
0:5:40,95 --> 0:5:45,65
This past week, Teno Groppi handed me a
video of an alleged fossil human footprint


58
0:5:45,65 --> 0:5:49,28
found in South Africa. I shortly thereafter
got bombarded with questions from


59
0:5:49,28 --> 0:5:53,3
viewers, asking my opinion on this track.
I was actually very grateful to see the


60
0:5:53,3 --> 0:5:57,86
video, as Teno and I both belong to a
discussion group about fossil footprints,


61
0:5:57,86 --> 0:6:2,27
and someone had posted some rather
poor photos of this alleged track.


62
0:6:2,27 --> 0:6:7,7
Michael Tellinger posted a video report of
this odd feature in the rock, and they did


63
0:6:7,7 --> 0:6:12,27
a splendid job of showing the anomaly.
I'm afraid to report however, for multiple


64
0:6:12,27 --> 0:6:15,88
reasons, I do not believe this is a fossil
human footprint.


65
0:6:15,88 --> 0:6:21,11
The "footprint" is in granite. Now the
conventional belief is that granite forms


66
0:6:21,11 --> 0:6:25,53
from a melt.  If that is the case, then you
have humans walking around, leaving


67
0:6:25,53 --> 0:6:30,86
footprints in molten rock.  Obviously, this
is impossible.  But even if the granite


68
0:6:30,86 --> 0:6:35,52
formed in a cold process, I still do not
think it's a human footprint.  For example,


69
0:6:35,52 --> 0:6:41,24
do watch the video yourself - here's the
link right here, where is the mud that was


70
0:6:41,24 --> 0:6:46,41
displaced by the foot making the
footprint? There isn't any.  On a track that


71
0:6:46,41 --> 0:6:50,92
deep, there should be some - in fact, quite
a bit.  Secondly, I have personally


72
0:6:50,92 --> 0:6:54,82
investigated erosional features such as
those that make up the toes in this


73
0:6:54,82 --> 0:7:1,77
"track," in multiple locations.  It is caused
by fracture and erosion, and in fact


74
0:7:1,77 --> 0:7:5,27
several geologist friends and I were
discussing how this could happen.  In fact,


75
0:7:5,27 --> 0:7:10,22
in the video you can see some other
overhangs off to the left of the track, in


76
0:7:10,22 --> 0:7:14,79
the rock face.  They just do not bear any
resemblance to toes or anything, but they


77
0:7:14,79 --> 0:7:18,68
are fracture and erosional features just
like you see in the footprint.


78
0:7:18,68 --> 0:7:22,99
A Professor Pieter Wagener is quoted
regarding the allegation of erosional


79
0:7:22,99 --> 0:7:32,6
features, saying 


80
0:7:32,6 --> 0:7:37,51
With respect Professor Wagener, as one
of the leading fossil human footprint


81
0:7:37,51 --> 0:7:42,63
experts within the Creation community, I
get typically 1 to 3 requests per year to


82
0:7:42,63 --> 0:7:47,93
come investigate alleged fossil human
footprints.  Of all the investigations I have


83
0:7:47,93 --> 0:7:52,17
carried out, only one of them appeared to
be genuine. All the others turned out to


84
0:7:52,17 --> 0:7:57,9
be foot print-shaped depressions, wave
ripples, fractures or erosion in rock -


85
0:7:57,9 --> 0:8:2,81
including granite and gneiss.  Some of
them, were in fact, even more convincing


86
0:8:2,81 --> 0:8:7,27
that the South African feature.  And you
know what I have learned over the years?


87
0:8:7,27 --> 0:8:11,51
People get really really angry when you
tell them their fossil human footprint isn't


88
0:8:11,51 --> 0:8:15,28
a fossil human footprint.
The fact is that you can so can get so


89
0:8:15,28 --> 0:8:18,87
many shapes and depressions in rocks,
that you will get footprint impressions -


90
0:8:18,87 --> 0:8:23,76
human or otherwise. These are pseudo
fossils.  It is just for this reason that


91
0:8:23,76 --> 0:8:27,86
typically a dinosaur track is not
considered genuine unless you have


92
0:8:27,86 --> 0:8:34,31
three tracks in a row, or other tracks in
that immediate locality.  The absense of a


93
0:8:34,31 --> 0:8:39,22
trail of human footprints at the South
Africa site is also a major blow to the


94
0:8:39,22 --> 0:8:42,79
authenticity of this feature being a human
footprint.


95
0:8:42,79 --> 0:8:48,15
So while I must regretably say that "No, it
is not a fossil human footprint," I must


96
0:8:48,15 --> 0:8:52,42
say well done to MIchael Tellinger on his
report. Thank you - you did an excellent


97
0:8:52,42 --> 0:8:57,7
job of reporting this feature, showing
video from a far off, as well as close-in


98
0:8:57,7 --> 0:9:3,6
detail.  This was much better
documentation then I'd seen thus far, so I


99
0:9:3,6 --> 0:9:5,89
am grateful, thanks for your hard work.


100
0:9:5,89 --> 0:9:11,21
[scary,dramatic music]


101
0:9:11,21 --> 0:9:13,58
Wahoo! Mail for me?


102
0:9:13,58 --> 0:9:17,93
[scary, dramatic music]


103
0:9:17,93 --> 0:9:21,91
Genesis week has again found itself in the
top ten of most discussed videos for the


104
0:9:21,91 --> 0:9:25,16
week in science and technology on
youtube.  I got a barrage of emails from


105
0:9:25,16 --> 0:9:28,36
skeptics wanting me to cover
thermodynamics on Genesis Week, and


106
0:9:28,36 --> 0:9:31,66
claiming that because I hadn't covered it,
my silence must be acknowledgement


107
0:9:31,66 --> 0:9:36,2
that I was wrong about what I said a few
weeks back.  Actually, if you recall, I said I


108
0:9:36,2 --> 0:9:40,47
was going to make a video dedicated to
the subject.  I am still working on it - I am


109
0:9:40,47 --> 0:9:44,41
producing this show weekly, which is a lot
of work, I'm working on a book, and I'm


110
0:9:44,41 --> 0:9:49,14
appearing on the Creation Today
program, so I've been swamped.  So just


111
0:9:49,14 --> 0:9:54,68
....be patient!  My - I've never had such a
large group of people begging me to give


112
0:9:54,68 --> 0:9:57,43
them a public caning!


113
0:9:57,43 --> 0:10:15,7
Some viewers wrote in last week:


114
0:10:15,7 --> 0:10:20,52
Thanks for writing in, but apparently you
missed the point.  You admit in your


115
0:10:20,52 --> 0:10:25,24
comments that the evolutionism myth
claims bird hips evolved from lizard hips.


116
0:10:25,24 --> 0:10:29,65
To change a lizard hip into a bird hip
takes major re-engineering of the


117
0:10:29,65 --> 0:10:34,47
structure of the entire organism - muscles
need to be moved, removed, attached


118
0:10:34,47 --> 0:10:38,79
elsewhere along with the major bone
changes.  Yet, you somehow seem to think


119
0:10:38,79 --> 0:10:43,41
this outlandish story is more believable if
some of the dinosaurs kept their lizard


120
0:10:43,41 --> 0:10:48,7
hips? Look, you are welcome to believe
that lizard hips kept right on trucking in


121
0:10:48,7 --> 0:10:52,3
different organisms, but that frankly is
quite irrelevent to the discussion of


122
0:10:52,3 --> 0:11:31,61
whether or not lizard hips could even
evolve into bird hips.


123
0:11:31,61 --> 0:11:37,24
Actually, ten times in the first chapter of
Genesis alone, it says God created life to


124
0:11:37,24 --> 0:11:43,58
reproduce after its kind.  Of course what
we actually see in the fossil record lines


125
0:11:43,58 --> 0:11:50,15
up with Genesis - we see extinction, and
stasis - organisms reproducing faithfully


126
0:11:50,15 --> 0:11:55,33
after their kind.  That is what is
observable.  Evolution is not observable,


127
0:11:55,33 --> 0:11:57,81
testable, nor repeatable.


128
0:11:57,81 --> 0:12:24,93
Vegavis also wrote in about Protoavis:


129
0:12:24,93 --> 0:12:28,82
Thanks for writing in, however multiple
paleontologists, including my good friend


130
0:12:28,82 --> 0:12:33,42
Joe Taylor who actually saw the original
protoavis fossil with his own two eyes,


131
0:12:33,42 --> 0:12:38,34
see the fossil as a completely modern
bird. Taylor actually lives just outside of


132
0:12:38,34 --> 0:12:42,23
Post, Texas where the fossil was found,
and I've actually excavated in those


133
0:12:42,23 --> 0:12:46,32
triassic redbeds, with Taylor.  When
Taylor saw the fossil, he said to


134
0:12:46,32 --> 0:12:50,88
Chatterjee "You know, the unbiased
person would say that looks just like a


135
0:12:50,88 --> 0:12:56,59
blackbird." To which Chaterjee agreed!
The only reason protoavis is


136
0:12:56,59 --> 0:13:3,52
"controversial" is because the rock layers
in which it was found are "too old" for


137
0:13:3,52 --> 0:13:6,5
birds.
As for the Horton bluff fossil trackways,


138
0:13:6,5 --> 0:13:10,6
you are grossly in error.  The original
claims described the track maker as a


139
0:13:10,6 --> 0:13:14,69
crocodile-like creature, the Nova Scotia
Museum website claims they were made


140
0:13:14,69 --> 0:13:19,57
by an amphibian, and in a 2004 GSA
paper, Lucas Spencer described the


141
0:13:19,57 --> 0:13:24,82
interpretation of the tracks as
"embarassingly bad blunder."  He then


142
0:13:24,82 --> 0:13:27,39
went on to make his own embarrassing
remarks and claimed the tracks were


143
0:13:27,39 --> 0:13:34,51
probably made by fish fins!  I've personally
studied and mapped out the trail.  The


144
0:13:34,51 --> 0:13:40,2
tracks were clearly made by a bipedal
animal with two large toes, a big claw off


145
0:13:40,2 --> 0:13:45,1
the tip of the larger toe, and no tail drag
evidence anywhere. I compared those


146
0:13:45,1 --> 0:13:49,47
footprints to actual ostrich tracks at an
ostrich ranch in Alberta, and they are a


147
0:13:49,47 --> 0:13:54,12
dead ringer, complete with a claw
impression off the tip of the larger toe.


148
0:13:54,12 --> 0:13:58,55
Interestingly, the famous Canadian
geologist, William Logan, found fossil bird


149
0:13:58,55 --> 0:14:3,83
tracks in that immediate area, in 1841.
Sternberg mentioned these tracks in more


150
0:14:3,83 --> 0:14:11,73
detail in a GSA bulletin in 1933, and said
the tracks "superficially ... resemble the


151
0:14:11,73 --> 0:14:16,45
tracks of some of the wading birds, but of
course there is little probability of their


152
0:14:16,45 --> 0:14:23,85
having been made by birds."  Because as
we all know, they can't be bird tracks,


153
0:14:23,85 --> 0:15:12,92
because birds had not yet evolved in the
carboniferous, right?


154
0:15:12,92 --> 0:15:17,7
CircusOfPrecision got into a lengthy
debate with several youtubers, making


155
0:15:17,7 --> 0:15:21,1
numerous, significant points. I hope you
don't mind my calling you "precision" for


156
0:15:21,1 --> 0:15:25,56
short. It was clear that precision had a
pretty wide range of knowledge, and I was


157
0:15:25,56 --> 0:15:29,29
pretty impressed with their patience as
they tried to explain their points to people


158
0:15:29,29 --> 0:15:34,77
who did not want to understand. In
response to claims that somehow letters


159
0:15:34,77 --> 0:16:4,79
in the DNA were information, precision
wrote:


160
0:16:4,79 --> 0:16:9,92
You are right on the money Precision.
Letters do not equal information, letters


161
0:16:9,92 --> 0:16:15,4
convey information.  You need more than
letters - you need someone to assemble


162
0:16:15,4 --> 0:16:20,36
the letters into information, a system for
conveying the information, a system for


163
0:16:20,36 --> 0:16:24,25
reading the information and a system for
using the information, as precision


164
0:16:24,25 --> 0:16:29,86
pointed out, based upon predetermined,
arbitrary rules.  A simile would be


165
0:16:29,86 --> 0:16:33,49
someone speaking Arabic to someone
who speaks and understands only english


166
0:16:33,49 --> 0:16:37,6
- loads of information there, but they are
operating on different rules to convey


167
0:16:37,6 --> 0:16:43,48
information, and the information is lost,
and unusable because of the system


168
0:16:43,48 --> 0:16:46,56
breakdown.
The incredible systems involved in life


169
0:16:46,56 --> 0:16:50,57
that use the information in the DNA are
staggering in their complexity, and


170
0:16:50,57 --> 0:16:55,18
necessary to read the information in the
DNA.  But the information on how to build


171
0:16:55,18 --> 0:16:58,87
those systems, necessary to read
information in the DNA, comes from the


172

information conveyed by the DNA!  It's a
codependent system.  As we can see in


173
0:17:3,8 --> 0:17:8,37
the comments left against Precision by
those who refused to understand, one


174
0:17:8,37 --> 0:17:14,25
can truly say that there is none so blind
as those who will not see.  The comments


175
0:17:14,25 --> 0:17:18,52
were just as shocking to follow as the
story of Jesus healing the blind man from


176
0:17:18,52 --> 0:17:23,88
birth, and the reaction of those who did
not want to believe in Christ. You can see


177
0:17:23,88 --> 0:17:28,51
why Jesus said "For judgment I am come
into this world, that they which see not


178
0:17:28,51 --> 0:17:34,1
might see; and that they which see might
be made blind."


179
0:17:34,1 --> 0:17:38,85
Precision, I don't know who you are, but
for your valiant efforts in the intellectual


180
0:17:38,85 --> 0:17:42,24
battle, I salute you.


181
0:17:42,24 --> 0:17:45,7

Remember the words of Jesus who said "I


184
0:17:53,12 --> 0:17:57,24
am the way, the TRUTH, and THE LIFE -
no man comes to the Father but through


185
0:17:57,24 --> 0:17:59,24
me." See you next Thursday.
