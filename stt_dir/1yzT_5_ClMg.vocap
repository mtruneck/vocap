###181 - 1925, and the Prince of Wales embarks on his tour
###185 of the Indian subcontinent,
###188 the welcoming cheers that greet the heir to the imperial throne
###192 proof positive that India remains
###194 just as steadfastly loyal to the Crown
###197 as it was in the days of his great-grandmother
###200 Queen Victoria.
###229 - Wait there a minute.
###231 - Sir.
###235 - Which is the lady that I must seize upon?
###239 - This same is she, and I do give you her.
###242 - Why, then she's mine.
###245 Sweet, let me see your face.
###246 I am your husband, if you like of me.
###249 Give me your hand before this holy friar.
###253 - Soft and fair, friar.
###255 Which is Beatrice?
###257 - I answer to that name.
###259 What is your will?
###261 - Do not you love me?
###263 - Why, no, no more than reason.
###266 Do not you love me?
###268 - Troth, no, no more than reason.
###271 - Why, then my cousin, Margaret, and Ursula are much deceived,
###274 for they did swear you did.
###295 Oh, what a totally ghastly audience.
###300 I didn't think they were too bad.
###303 - And now for another transformation scene.
###312 How to make myself look respectable
###315 for Government House.
###316 - Oh, I'm so excited!
###317 - Me too.
###320 - Is Mr. Blunt waiting?
###321 - He better be.
###323 - You're quite serious about him, aren't you?
###326 - I know you don't approve.
###328 - Oh, it's not my place to approve.
###330 - Oh, don't be so mamby-pamby, Mabelle.
###332 You think he's not good enough for me.
###335 - I just don't understand you.
###337 I mean, you're so ambitious,
###339 and with your background, you could--
###343 Who is it?
###344 - Come in.
###347 - Well, come on, girls.
###349 The prince is waiting.
###355 - The young prince immerses himself wholeheartedly
###359 in the exhausting schedule of duties entailed
###361 in such a great enterprise.
###365 In the stifling heat of an Indian midsummer,
###367 the grandest reception of all
###369 is held at Government House, Calcutta.
###382 - There she is.
###384 Why aren't you dancing, Mabelle?
###387 - Oh, it's so hot in there.
###389 Did you meet the Prince of Wales, Mr. Blunt?
###392 - No, never got closer than five yards.
###396 - We've got something to tell you.
###397 - Oh, no, Gerda, please. You promised--
###399 - Alistair wants it kept secret from his stuffy family,
###402 but we're going to be married!
###404 - Oh.
###406 Oh, that's wonderful.
###411 Congratulations, Mr. Blunt.
###413 When will this be?
###414 - Quite soon, actually.
###416 Alistair's bank want him back in London next month.
###420 Oh, come on, Alistair.
###421 I want to dance!
###424 - Excuse us, please, Miss Sainsbury Seale.
###431 - And so at last, time to say good-bye.
###435 As he leaves India, the jewel of Britain's vast empire,
###439 the prince can look back with pride
###441 at a job well done.
###444 We'd like to join with the people of India
###446 in saying thank you and God bless the Prince of Wales.
###547 - Sit yourself down, Mr. Poirot.
###568 Quite comfortable?
###573 We'll start the preparatory work today, Mr. Poirot.
###575 - I'm so sorry to have kept you.
###577 - Oh, that's all right.
###580 Mr. Morley asked me to make another appointment.
###583 - Ah.
###586 What about...
###588 the 6th of August at 11:45, Miss Sainsbury Seale?
###592 - Uh, yes, that looks perfect.
###622 - Should I get out here and take a cab, Uncle Alistair?
###624 - No, no, it's all right.
###626 I'll walk back to the office.
###627 Keep the car. Finish your shopping.
###629 As long as I have it back by half past 5:00.
###631 - Excuse me.
###632 It's Alistair Blunt, isn't it?
###635 - Yes?
###636 - You don't remember me.
###637 Mabelle. Mabelle Sainsbury Seale.
###640 I was your wife's friend.
###643 - Yes.
###645 Yes, of course I remember you.
###648 Um, I'll see you at home later, then, Jane.
###651 - It was in India, if you remember.
###653 Gerda and I were on tour together.
###655 I've only just come back after all these years.
###658 Oh, I've been doing work for the zenana missions, you know.
###663 - Well, it's wonderful to see you again,
###664 Miss Sainsbury Seale, it really is, but I--
###666 - I'd love to see Gerda again.
###672 - Miss Seale.
###674 - Sainsbury Seale. Yes?
###678 Why, Mr. Amberiotis.
###681 Oh, I'm sorry.
###682 I didn't recognize you for a moment.
###684 How nice.
###687 - I came to return...this.
###691 - My hot water bottle.
###695 Oh!
###696 What must you think.
###699 This gentleman and I were on the boat
###701 coming back from India together.
###703 I lent him my hot water bottle when he had a toothache.
###716 Have you been to a dentist yet
###718 about that tooth, Mr. Amberiotis?
###719 - Not yet, no.
###721 It doesn't hurt so much.
###723 - That's very naughty of you.
###725 You must go and see my man, Mr. Morley in Harley Street.
###729 As a matter of fact, it's rather a coincidence.
###732 I saw him only this morning, and as I was coming out,
###735 I ran into another old friend from India--
###738 but from much longer ago, of course.
###740 His wife and I were together
###742 in the touring company I told you about.
###744 - Oh, yes, yes.
###746 When you were an actress.
###748 - Quite.
###750 And he's done awfully well, I believe, since then.
###752 Mr. Alistair Blunt.
###754 - Mr. Alistair Blunt the banker?
###757 - I believe so.
###759 He certainly used to work in a bank when he met Gerda.
###762 - Gerda?
###764 - His wife.
###766 Oh, we were such pals.
###769 Of course, she was a better actress than I.
###772 I always said she'd get on in the profession,
###774 but she left it to marry Alistair,
###777 and I left it to stay in India.
###789 - Thank you, sir.
###846 - Hold tight, please.
###875 - Oh.
###876 - Yes, ma'am.
###877 - My name's Sainsbury Seale.
###879 I want to see Mrs. Blunt.
###880 She's staying with Mrs. Chapman.
###882 - Mrs. Chapman, right.
###884 This way, ma'am.
###891 Number 45, ma'am, just there.
###893 - Thank you so much.
###900 Gerda!
###902 After all these years.
###916 - Where are you going with those?
###919 - Miss Sainsbury Seale telephoned, miss.
###921 She's moving to the Carlisle Hotel
###923 in South Kensington, wants her bags sent on.
###926 - Oh, yes. Go on, then.
###940 - That damn boy's late again.
###944 And smoking on the front doorstep.
###947 Young people nowadays--
###950 unreliable, self-centered.
###954 The girls are as bad.
###957 Gladys isn't coming in today.
###959 Her aunt's had a stroke, and she's had to go up to Yorkshire.
###961 - That's hardly the girl's fault.
###965 - She's been different lately.
###967 It's that Frank Carter fellow.
###969 - Girls do fall in love, Henry.
###973 - Love?
###974 She's a cut above him, I should hope.
###976 You know he's in with that Blackshirt mob.
###978 Anyway, she shouldn't let it affect her efficiency
###980 as my secretary.
###982 Let her fall in love in her own time.
###998 - Good morning, Mr. Amberiotis.
###1001 Is everything all right, sir?
###1003 - What?
###1005 No.
###1007 Yes, it's just a...toothache.
###1015 Take it away.
###1046 - Thank you.
###1104 - Mr. Por-oat?
###1131 - Till the end of the financial year.
###1134 - Thank you, Charles.
###1138 Any other business?
###1139 - There's the question of the debenture issue.
###1142 - That was covered on the agenda.
###1144 - Yes, but we left the date open.
###1147 - Quite.
###1149 That's all, I think.
###1150 Meeting closed.
###1151 Thank you, gentlemen.
###1160 - All right, Alistair?
###1161 - All right? Yes, I'm fine.
###1163 - Can I give you a lift?
###1164 - No, my car's waiting. I'm going to the dentist.
###1167 - I see. That's why you were in such a bad mood.
###1170 - We'll get your treatment finished today, Mr. Poirot.
###1175 Now, as I was saying,
###1177 the important people, they're always on time.
###1181 Now, I've got a most important man coming this morning.
###1184 - Mr. Alistair Blunt.
###1186 Alistair Blunt?
###1187 - Oh, yes.
###1188 Always on time.
###1191 Nice, unassuming fellow.
###1193 Often sends his Rolls away and walks back to the office
###1197 just like you and me.
###1198 You would never dream he could buy up half Europe.
###1222 Well, good-bye, Mr. Poirot.
###1225 Wasn't too bad this time, was it?
###1226 - No.
###1227 - Shall I ring for the lift for you?
###1228 - No, no, no, thank you. I shall walk down.
###1230 - I'll see you in six months.
###1263 - Mr. Blunt.
###1271 - Excuse me.
###1288 - Ooh!
###1289 - Oh!
###1295 - So kind.
###1296 - Not at all, madame.
###1298 - Ooh!
###1299 - Oh, dear.
###1301 - Thank you.
###1302 - You're welcome, madame.
###1303 - Thank you so much.
###1312 - I have an appointment with Mr. Morley.
###1314 - Name?
###1315 - Miss Sainsbury Seale.
###1385 - Well?
###1387 I have now been waiting for 45 minutes.
###1390 My appointment was for half past 12:00.
###1392 - Well, I know--
###1394 - I shall now go back to Worthing!
###1396 You may tell Mr. Morley that I am most displeased.
###1405 - "I am most displeased."
###1444 Oh, my god.
###1468 - Revolver grasped in lifeless fingers.
###1472 Doesn't seem to be much doubt about it, does there?
###1474 It has to be suicide.
###1481 - C'est incroyable.
###1483 - All right, you can move him now.
###1487 - So tell me, Chief Inspector Japp.
###1490 - Lived upstairs with his sister.
###1493 Hasn't been moody or depressed.
###1495 I wondered if you'd noticed anything
###1497 when you saw him this morning.
###1498 - Nothing at all.
###1500 He was, what shall I say, normality itself.
###1505 When did it occur, this tragedy?
###1507 - Can't say exactly.
###1509 Nobody seems to have heard the shot.
###1511 It was discovered about 1:30 by the pageboy, Alfred Biggs.
###1516 - At what time did Monsieur Morley
###1518 last press the buzzer for a new patient?
###1520 - 5 past 12:00, and the boy showed up
###1523 the patient who was waiting, a Mr. Amberiotis,
###1528 staying at the Astoria Hotel,
###1530 according to the appointment book.
###1531 - And at what time did he leave, this Monsieur Amberiotis?
###1535 - Well, the boy didn't show him out,
###1537 so he doesn't know.
###1538 But I rang up the Astoria, and Mr. Amberiotis says
###1542 he looked at his watch as he closed the front door
###1544 and it was exactly 25 past 12:00.
###1550 - So at 25 minutes past 12:00,
###1553 our dentist, he is the normal dentist, eh--
###1554 cheerful, competent, urbane.
###1556 And the very next moment, despair, misery, what you will,
###1560 and he shoots himself?
###1561 No.
###1564 - It's quite incredible to me
###1566 that my brother should have committed suicide.
###1568 - He'd been quite his usual self, had he, madam?
###1572 Not upset in any way?
###1574 - He was annoyed.
###1576 He had a busy day in front of him,
###1578 and his assistant had received a telegram
###1580 to say her aunt had had a stroke.
###1582 She left for Yorkshire by an early train.
###1585 - And your brother, he was annoyed at this?
###1588 - Well, the fact is...
###1590 His assistant's got engaged
###1592 to a rather unsuitable young man,
###1595 and it occurred to Henry that this young man
###1597 had persuaded her to take the day off.
###1599 - What does he do, this young man?
###1602 - Frank Carter is--or was-- an insurance clerk.
###1606 He lost his job a few weeks ago and seems unable to get another.
###1610 - Did your brother try and persuade her
###1611 to break off her engagement?
###1613 - Oh, yes, he did, as a matter of fact.
###1616 - So this Frank Carter would quite possibly have a grudge
###1619 against your brother.
###1622 - It's that Miss Neville.
###1623 She's back in a rare taking, she is.
###1625 - The whole thing was a wicked practical joke.
###1627 There wasn't anything wrong with Auntie at all.
###1629 She couldn't understand it when I suddenly turned up.
###1632 - Are you quite sure
###1633 it wasn't your friend Mr. Carter who sent this telegram?
###1636 - Frank? Whatever for?
###1639 Oh, I see what you mean.
###1642 A put-up job between us.
###1643 We wouldn't do a thing like that.
###1645 - Tell me, mademoiselle,
###1647 what patients had Mr. Morley this morning?
###1649 - They're all in here.
###1658 Um, at 10:00, Mrs. Soames about her new plate.
###1662 10:30, Lady Gregson. She's an elderly lady.
###1665 11:00, Mr. Hercule Poirot.
###1668 Oh, that's you, isn't it?
###1670 11:30, Mr. Alistair Blunt-- you know, the banker.
###1674 Then Miss Sainsbury Seale.
###1676 She's just back from India.
###1678 12:00, Mr. Amberiotis.
###1680 He was a new patient,
###1682 made his appointment from the Astoria Hotel.
###1685 And 12:30, Mrs. Pinner. She comes up from Worthing.
###1692 - If you please, Alfred, tell me,
###1694 is it possible for anyone to enter the house
###1696 without you having to let them in?
###1698 - Nah.
###1699 No, not a chance.
###1701 Well, not unless they got a key, anyway.
###1703 - But it is quite easy for them to leave the house.
###1706 - Oh, yeah.
###1708 Yeah, most of them come down the stairs
###1710 while I'm taking the new party up in the lift, see.
###1712 - Did you see Mr. Amberiotis leave?
###1715 - Nah.
###1716 No, he must have let himself out.
###1718 - But you are quite sure that nobody else came
###1720 to the house this morning, only the patients.
###1723 - That Mrs. Neville's young man came round.
###1725 In a bit of a paddy, he was, not to find her here.
###1728 - We haven't heard about this before.
###1730 - Well, when I told him
###1732 Miss Neville was out for the day,
###1733 he got quite shirty,
###1734 said he'd wait and see Mr. Morley.
###1737 Well, then he went into the waiting room.
###1739 You must have seen him there, sir.
###1741 - Ah, yes.
###1743 The troubled young man who would not sit down.
###1746 - Yeah, must have got tired of waiting, I suppose.
###1749 He wasn't there later.
###1753 - Why, Chief Inspector Japp, an officer of your eminence,
###1757 is he usually called in to a case of apparent suicide?
###1760 - Alistair Blunt was here.
###1761 Mr. Blunt is the kind of person we take care of in this country.
###1764 - You mean that there are certain people
###1766 who would like him out of the way?
###1767 - You bet there are.
###1769 The Reds, to begin with.
###1770 And our Blackshirted friends.
###1772 This Blunt and his group have a standing
###1773 behind the present government.
###1775 - That is more or less as I guessed.
###1783 Tell me something about Monsieur Blunt, Chief Inspector.
###1786 - Alistair Blunt?
###1788 He controls all the Arnholt interests in Europe
###1791 as well as the merchant banks.
###1793 He married into the family.
###1796 We oughtn't spend too long with him.
###1798 I want to get on to the Astoria.
###1800 As it stands at the moment, this Mr. Amberiotis
###1803 was the last person to see Mr. Morley alive.
###1806 - This is the second occasion this year
###1809 that my allowance has not been paid on time, Alistair.
###1812 - You must talk to the bank, Julia, or to the trustees.
###1816 - If only my poor dear sister were still alive.
###1820 - If she were alive, Mother,
###1821 you couldn't benefit from her will.
###1823 - That is a wicked thing to say, Jane.
###1825 - It's not wicked; it's true.
###1827 - The truth is often wicked.
###1831 - I'm sorry, Julie; this is not my business.
###1834 When I die, the capital will come to you,
###1836 to do with exactly as you wish.
###1838 Until then--
###1839 - Until then, I am expected to exist--I won't say "live"--
###1844 on the pittance from the trust.
###1847 - $25,000 a year can scarcely be called a pittance.
###1865 - Do you think Rebecca intended me
###1867 to live on your charity?
###1868 - It is not charity.
###1873 Yes, Miss Montressor.
###1875 - A Chief Inspector Japp and a Mr. Poirot to see you, sir.
###1878 - Really? Would you show them in, please?
###1884 Chief Inspector Japp.
###1886 - How do you do, sir?
###1887 This is Mr. Hercule Poirot.
###1889 - I know your name, of course, Monsieur Poirot,
###1892 but surely somewhere quite recently--
###1895 - This morning, Monsieur Blunt.
###1896 In the waiting room of the dentist,
###1898 the pauvre Monsieur Morley.
###1900 - Yes, of course. I knew I'd seen you somewhere.
###1902 "Pauvre"?
###1904 - Mr. Morley was found dead, sir, shortly after you left,
###1907 an apparent suicide.
###1910 - Morley?
###1912 Suicide?
###1913 - What an extraordinary thing.
###1915 - Uh...
###1917 Forgive me. I'm sorry.
###1918 This is my niece, Miss Olivera,
###1920 and her mother, Mrs. Olivera.
###1922 - Mademoiselle, madame.
###1925 - I've never heard of a dentist committing suicide before.
###1928 Wouldn't happen in the States; you can be sure of that.
###1931 They're too damn rich to kill themselves.
###1934 - He seemed in good health and spirits this morning, Mr. Blunt?
###1938 - Well, I think so, yes.
###1939 - Have you seen him often?
###1941 - This is my third or fourth visit.
###1943 - Monsieur Blunt, who was it
###1944 that recommended to you Monsieur Morley originally?
###1947 - Arnholt, one of my directors. Lionel Arnholt.
###1950 - We're just wondering, you see, sir,
###1951 whether it wasn't suicide but murder
###1954 and the real target was yourself.
###1958 - But that doesn't make any sense at all.
###1961 - Well, none of it does at the moment, sir.
###1963 That's the problem.
###1994 - Good evening.
###1997 - We'd like to see Mr. Amberiotis.
###1999 - I'm sorry, sir. I'm afraid you can't.
###2003 - Oh, yes, I can, my lad.
###2005 Police.
###2006 - You don't understand, sir.
###2009 Mr. Amberiotis died half an hour ago.
###2059 - Interesting.
###2060 - Interesting, Dr. Bennett?
###2062 - Mr. Amberiotis died of heart failure.
###2066 - Heart failure?
###2069 - Brought about by an overdose of adrenaline and novocaine.
###2073 - How large an overdose?
###2074 - Oh, I can't say yet.
###2076 These quantitative analyses take time.
###2078 I'll be able to tell you tomorrow.
###2080 - Novocaine's the stuff dentists give you, isn't it?
###2082 - That's right, Chief Inspector.
###2083 The subject had been to the dentist, I believe.
###2092 - What a washout.
###2094 - What do you mean, Chief Inspector?
###2095 - Morley makes a mistake and injects an overdose.
###2098 Then when Amberiotis is gone, he realizes what he's done,
###2101 can't face the music, and shoots himself.
###2103 - With a pistol he is not known to possess?
###2106 - Relations don't know everything.
###2107 - No, that is true, of course.
###2109 - Well, there we are, then.
###2112 - All the same, Chief Inspector, it does not quite satisfy me.
###2116 - Ah, cheer up, Poirot.
###2118 We can't have a nice juicy murder every time.
###2123 - Committed suicide? Mr. Morley?
###2127 Poor man.
###2129 I suppose he had something on his mind.
###2133 Such worrying times we live in.
###2135 - Did he seem worried to you, Miss Sainsbury Seale?
###2138 - Well, I--I can't really say, you know, that he did.
###2144 - Can you tell us who else was in the waiting room
###2147 while you were there?
###2148 - Let me see.
###2150 There was just one young man there when I went in.
###2153 I think he was in pain,
###2154 because he was muttering to himself
###2156 and looking quite wild.
###2158 And then suddenly he jumped up and went out.
###2161 - And he was the only other patient that you noticed?
###2164 - A gentleman came down the stairs and went out
###2168 just as I went up to Mr. Morley.
###2171 Oh, and I remember a very peculiar foreigner
###2174 came out of the house just as I arrived.
###2178 - That was I, madame.
###2183 - Oh.
###2185 Oh, dear.
###2187 Oh, do forgive me.
###2188 Oh. Oh.
###2190 The light in here is so dim.
###2192 - Please calm yourself, madame.
###2194 - Well, I think that's about all,
###2197 Miss Sainsbury Seale.
###2198 We may require you to give evidence
###2200 at the inquest, of course.
###2201 - Oh, no!
###2203 I would be so nervous.
###2204 - Well, no need to be nervous, madam.
###2207 Just stand up and speak clearly.
###2209 - Oh!
###2211 That's very amusing, Chief Inspector.
###2213 - Is it?
###2214 - I used to be an actress.
###2216 Just small parts, you know.
###2218 Then I went on a world tour--
###2221 - Yes, well...
###2225 - Well, if my name should be in the papers--
###2229 as a witness at the inquest, I mean--
###2231 you will be sure that it's spelled right, won't you?
###2234 Miss Mabelle Sainsbury Seale.
###2237 Mabelle spelled M-a-b-e-I-I-e.
###2248 - Blimey.
###2256 - I can only give you a few moments,
###2257 I'm afraid, Mr. Poirot.
###2260 I'm going to see Traviata at Covent Garden.
###2263 - Ah. Thank you, Monsieur Arnholt.
###2271 - What's this all about?
###2273 - It is about the death of the dentist Monsieur Henry Morley.
###2277 It was you, was it not,
###2279 who recommended him to Monsieur Blunt?
###2280 - Yes, I've been going to him for years.
###2284 You don't think I killed him, do you?
###2285 - Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
###2287 Quelle idée. No.
###2289 It is just that I'm given to wonder
###2291 whether Monsieur Blunt was not perhaps the intended victim.
###2295 - I don't quite see how that works.
###2297 - No.
###2298 At this moment, Monsieur Arnholt, neither do I.
###2301 One grips at the straws.
###2303 But tell me, Madame Olivera,
###2307 the sister-in-law to Monsieur Blunt,
###2308 she is une dame formidable, n'est-ce pas?
###2312 - Oh, indeed.
###2313 - How did Madame Olivera take
###2315 to Monsieur Blunt marrying her sister?
###2318 I mean, after all,
###2319 he was a mere employee of the family business.
###2321 - I don't know about "mere."
###2323 Alistair was head of our overseas investments department.
###2327 - Ah.
###2328 - But I don't think Aunt Julia looked at it like that anyway.
###2330 They were so obviously crazy about each other.
###2334 Nobody, of course, knew, but she was already suffering
###2337 from the disease that killed her four years later.
###2340 - A tragedy.
###2342 - Yes.
###2346 - Pardon.
###2348 I must detain you no longer from your Monsieur Verdi.
###2353 Monsieur Arnholt, I thank you very much for your patience,
###2357 and I hope that you enjoy the opera.
###2360 - Thank you.
###2398 - I formed the opinion
###2400 that Mr. Amberiotis died of heart failure
###2403 caused by a large overdose
###2405 of a novocaine and adrenaline mixture.
###2409 - The dentist who treated Mr. Amberiotis earlier
###2412 on the day of his death
###2414 is now himself dead, I understand.
###2417 - So I understand, sir.
###2419 - Thank you, Dr. Bennett.
###2422 - Thank you.
###2425 - Well, there doesn't seem much doubt, gentlemen,
###2428 that this is a case of accidental death,
###2431 a very unfortunate case.
###2433 Did Mr. Morley accidentally give his patient
###2438 too large a dose of the anesthetic?
###2442 Or did Mr. Amberiotis have an unusual reaction to it?
###2448 Since Mr. Morley is now himself dead,
###2452 we shall never have the answer to this.
###2457 Nevertheless, it is your duty, of course,
###2461 gentlemen of the jury, to consider all possibilities
###2465 before you arrive at your verdict.
###2468 But I must remind you that before...
###2483 - Nobody's seen hide nor hair of Miss Sainsbury Seale
###2486 since Tuesday.
###2488 Such a nice type of woman, and she seemed so happy here.
###2492 - I wouldn't have bothered you with this, sir,
###2494 but I remember she'd been a witness in that other case.
###2497 - No, quite right, Beddoes.
###2502 Why should she disappear?
###2508 - It is curious, you admit?
###2512 - There was nothing funny about her, you know?
###2515 A cable to Calcutta.
###2516 Got the reply back last night.
###2519 She went out there as an actress and then took to good works.
###2523 Got hand in glove with the missionaries, apparently.
###2526 What I call a terrible woman
###2529 but definitely not the type to get mixed up in a murder.
###2533 You got anything?
###2536 - Stockings.
###2537 Ten-inch, cheap silk.
###2541 Price: probably 2 shillings and 11 pence.
###2545 - You're not valuing for probate, Poirot.
###2560 - Mr. Poirot.
###2563 - Mademoiselle Neville.
###2565 What a pleasant surprise.
###2567 - I'm so sorry to worry you like this,
###2569 but I had to see you.
###2570 I was very upset by the inquest this morning.
###2574 It couldn't happen the way they said it did--
###2576 giving a patient an overdose, I mean.
###2579 The dentists get into the habit
###2581 of giving the regulation amount automatically.
###2584 - But you did not say this in the coroner's court.
###2586 - I was afraid of making things worse.
###2589 People might think he did it deliberately.
###2592 - I see.
###2594 Shall we discuss this further?
###2596 Come.
###2609 I should like to know a little bit more
###2611 about the telegram you received calling you away on that day.
###2615 Do you yourself have any ideas on the subject?
###2618 - Not really.
###2622 Frank, my friend,
###2625 accused me of wanting to go off for the day with somebody else.
###2628 - Oh!
###2629 - He's been very moody and suspicious lately.
###2632 Just losing his job
###2634 and not being able to get another one, I suppose.
###2636 - And he was upset, was he not, to discover
###2637 that you had gone away on that day?
###2639 - Yes.
###2640 You see, he'd come round to tell me
###2641 how he'd got this marvelous new job,
###2643 £10 a week.
###2644 - Ooh.
###2646 - He wanted me to know right away.
###2649 - And what is it, this new job?
###2651 - Oh, well, I don't know all the details.
###2654 Some government department.
###2657 I have to write to his London address,
###2659 and the letters get forwarded.
###2660 - Oh, la.
###2662 Does that not seem to you to be a little strange?
###2665 - Well, I thought so,
###2666 but Frank says it's often done nowadays.
###2672 - I should like to meet this friend of yours, mademoiselle.
###2676 - His only free day is Sunday.
###2678 He's away in the country all week.
###2680 - Eh bien, tomorrow is Sunday.
###2694 - I'm fed up with 'earing about Morley's death,
###2696 to be quite honest.
###2698 There wasn't anything so wonderful about him
###2700 that I could see.
###2702 - Tell me, Monsieur Carter,
###2703 why were you in Harley Street that day?
###2708 I saw you there in the waiting room.
###2713 - All right.
###2715 I was gonna tell Morley
###2717 that this business of putting Gladys against me
###2719 had gone on long enough, that I'd landed a good job,
###2722 and that it was about time she handed in her notice
###2724 a thought about a trousseau.
###2725 - But you did not actually tell him these things?
###2728 - I got fed up with waiting in that dingy mausoleum,
###2731 so I left.
###2732 - At what time did you leave?
###2734 - I can't remember.
###2738 I've got to get going; the march will be starting soon.
###2742 - It has been a great pleasure to meet you, Monsieur Carter.
###2747 And, yes, I am delighted to hear about your new job.
###2752 The work, it is interesting, n'est-ce pas?
###2756 - Oh, yeah.
###2758 You know.
###2760 I'll see you next week, Gladys.
###2763 - Bye, Frank.
###2764 - Au revoir, Monsieur Carter.
###2790 Are you receiving visitors, mon ami?
###2793 - Good heavens. Poirot.
###2794 - Chief Inspector.
###2796 - What on Earth brings you to Isleworth
###2797 on a Sunday afternoon?
###2798 - Business. What else?
###2800 - Well, you better come inside and have a cup of tea.
###2802 - Thank you.
###2811 - Madame Japp, she is not at home?
###2814 - No, no.
###2815 Some blessed meeting.
###2817 Women's institute, parish counsel, or something.
###2820 I don't know.
###2823 Do you take sugar, Poirot?
###2826 - Do you have perhaps a tisane?
###2828 - Come off it, Poirot.
###2829 This is Isleworth, you know, not Juan-les-Pins.
###2836 What's the business, anyway?
###2838 - I wondered if you'd been able to trace the telegram
###2841 that was sent to Mademoiselle Gladys Neville.
###2844 - Yes, we did, as a matter of fact.
###2846 Rather clever.
###2849 The aunt lives in Richmond in Yorkshire.
###2852 The telegram was handed in in Richmond, Surrey,
###2854 just down the road here.
###2856 - Do you know what I think, Chief Inspector?
###2858 - What's that?
###2865 - I think that there are signs of brains in this business.
###2869 - Well, the assistant commissioner is satisfied
###2871 that Morley killed himself.
###2873 - Is he satisfied with the disappearing lady?
###2875 - Ah, the case of the disappearing Seale.
###2879 No.
###2881 I'm still working on that.
###2883 She's got to be somewhere.
###2887 Mm. Garibaldi?
###2895 - And I really think my feelings ought to be considered
###2898 in the matter, Alistair.
###2899 - But your feelings have been considered, Mother.
###2901 - Yes, Julia, that is true.
###2905 - Mr. Poirot to see you, Mr. Blunt.
###2907 - Thank you, Helen.
###2908 Monsieur Poirot, it's very good of you to come.
###2910 - Monsieur Blunt.
###2911 - Well!
###2914 If you are going to talk horrors,
###2917 I shall leave.
###2920 - Allow me.
###2922 - I'll see you at home, Jane.
###2925 - Madame.
###2928 - You've met Miss Olivera, I think.
###2931 - Oh, yes, indeed. Mademoiselle.
###2933 - Please. - Thank you.
###2934 - I hope I haven't asked you here
###2936 on a wild goose chase, Mr. Poirot.
###2938 It's about this missing woman that the papers are full of,
###2941 Miss Sainsbury Seale.
###2943 - Yes. - Jane?
###2945 I'm sure this is utterly unimportant.
###2947 And why we are wasting Mr. Poirot's time,
###2950 I really don't know.
###2951 - If you please, Mr. Blunt, allow Poirot to decide.
###2954 - Well, Sainsbury Seale is such a pompous name.
###2957 That's why I remembered.
###2958 It was the last time
###2959 Uncle Alistair went to the dentist.
###2961 Well, I don't mean the other day;
###2963 I mean about a week ago.
###2964 I was with him, and we stopped in Harley Street,
###2967 and just as he got out, a woman came out of the dentist,
###2970 a middle-aged woman with fussy hair
###2973 and rather dowdy clothes.
###2975 "Oh, Mr. Blunt, you don't remember me, I'm sure."
###2979 - People are always saying that,
###2981 and I never do.
###2982 - "I was a great friend of your wife's, you know."
###2984 - They usually say that too.
###2986 It always ends the same way:
###2988 a subscription to some charity or other.
###2990 £5 to a zenana mission this time.
###2993 - And had she really known your wife, Monsieur Blunt?
###2996 - Well...
###2998 the mention of the zenana mission
###2999 made me think she may have done.
###3001 We were in India about four years ago,
###3003 just before my wife's death.
###3005 Perhaps we met once at a reception.
###3007 - I think it's queer
###3008 the way she tried to scrape an acquaintance with you.
###3011 - And she did not try to, um, how do you say,
###3016 follow it up in any way?
###3018 - Why, no.
###3019 I'd forgotten her name, even,
###3020 until Jane spotted it in the paper.
###3024 - Well, I just thought you ought to be told,
###3027 Monsieur Poirot.
###3035 - Here.
###3037 Here, Alison?
###3038 - What?
###3040 - There's a thing here about a woman who came here,
###3043 Miss Sainsbury Seale.
###3045 It says here she's missing.
###3051 - You don't have a passkey?
###3053 - No, I've never had one.
###3055 - We can't just break in.
###3057 - Well, suppose something's happened to her.
###3059 - Yes, and suppose she's gone off on holidays.
###3061 - Oh, no. Oh, no.
###3063 - Go on, Sergeant.
###3068 Right.
###3088 - Mrs. Chapman!
###3089 - Leave it to us.
###3092 Mrs. Chapman!
###3097 - Sergeant.
###3107 Hello?
###3112 Anybody there?
###3118 Mrs. Chapman?
###3124 Hello?
###3134 Anybody here?
###3147 - This is the boxroom.
###3152 - What's that?
###3153 - Well, I don't know.
###3160 - Shall I open it, Sarge?
###3163 - Go on, then.
###3205 It's not particularly pleasant.
###3218 - That's the porter being sick, sir.
###3221 I had to get him to have another look at the body
###3223 to identify it.
###3244 - There's some brandy in the other room.
###3263 - It was not pretty, that.
###3274 Tell me all about it, Chief Inspector.
###3276 - The flat belongs to a Mrs. Albert Chapman.
###3281 Can't tell you much about her, really.
###3283 Pays her bills.
###3284 Fond of a game of bridge.
###3286 Keeps herself to herself more or less.
###3290 The neighbors say they've hardly ever seen her, in fact.
###3294 Mr. Chapman's a commercial traveler, apparently,
###3297 so he spends most of his time away from home.
###3300 - And Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale?
###3303 - She came here on the evening of our interview with her,
###3306 about 7:15.
###3309 The porter's wife was cleaning up here
###3311 and saw her arrive.
###3312 She'd been here once before, the porter says.
###3316 Now, one thing's for certain:
###3318 Sylvia Chapman or Sylvia's friends
###3321 murdered the lady, put her in the box, and made off.
###3324 - But why was the face so battered?
###3326 - Sheer vindictiveness, maybe.
###3328 Or it may have been with the idea
###3330 of concealing the woman's identity.
###3332 I don't know.
###3336 No fingerprints anywhere, as far as we can see.
###3340 - You mean every fingerprint in the apartment
###3342 was removed after the murder?
###3344 - That's about the size of it.
###3387 Something worrying you, Poirot?
###3392 Yes.
###3396 Yes, I'm very seriously worried.
###3418 There is here, you see, an insoluble problem.
###3425 - One patent leather shoe, complete with buckle.
###3428 What's wrong with that?
###3429 - Nothing.
###3431 Absolutely nothing.
###3437 All the same, I do not understand.
###3448 Some bearers belonging to Madame Chapman.
###3453 Ah.
###3456 Some old theater programs.
###3465 A leaflet about the zenana missions.
###3467 - We can guess who brought that here.
###3473 - Nothing much of interest in the address book either, sir.
###3476 - No, so I see.
###3479 Hairdressers.
###3480 Dressmakers.
###3483 A dentist.
###3485 Morley, 168 Harley Street.
###3488 - Not so strange
###3490 if she was a friend of the Sainsbury Seale woman.
###3516 Pardon.
###3518 - Mr. Poirot?
###3521 What brings you here?
###3523 - Tell me, if you please,
###3525 did your brother ever mention to you in particular
###3529 a Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale or a Madame Chapman?
###3532 - No.
###3534 No, I don't think so.
###3536 - I managed to make this
###3537 before they took everything, Miss Morley.
###3539 - Oh, thank you, Agnes.
###3540 Would you like a cup, sir?
###3542 - Not for me, Agnes. Thank you very much.
###3546 - Agnes is coming with me to the country.
###3549 She's becoming quite a good little cook,
###3551 so she'll be able to do everything for me.
###3568 - Excuse me, sir... - Yes.
###3570 - For asking. - Yes.
###3572 - But does anyone know anything more
###3574 about the master's death, sir?
###3576 - Nothing fresh has come to light, Agnes.
###3578 - They're still quite sure he shot himself
###3580 because he'd made a mistake with that drug.
###3582 - Yes.
###3584 Why do you ask?
###3585 - I only-- - Agnes?
###3587 - I just want to be sure, sir.
###3590 - Agnes!
###3616 - Ah, Chief Inspector. - No time, Poirot.
###3618 We found Mr. and Mrs. Albert Chapman.
###3620 - Where?
###3621 - They booked into the Montague Hotel this morning.
###3623 - The Montague Hotel, Bloomsbury?
###3625 - That's right.
###3626 - It is odd, is it not,
###3627 being on the run after murdering Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale,
###3630 that they have not run further?
###3632 - You never can tell with the criminal mind, Poirot.
###3643 - Open up!
###3645 - Who is it?
###3646 - Police.
###3648 - Police?
###3649 - Just open the door, Mr. Chapman.
###3655 - Here!
###3657 - All right, there's no need for anyone to get hurt.
###3659 You are Mr. Albert Chapman?
###3662 - Yes.
###3663 - And this is Mrs. Chapman?
###3666 - Yes.
###3668 What's the meaning of this?
###3669 - I'll ask the questions, sir.
###3671 Do you live at number 45 Lichfield Court
###3673 in Battersea in the--
###3674 - No.
###3675 - What do you mean, "no"?
###3677 - Well, we don't.
###3679 Do we, Beryl?
###3681 - Beryl?
###3682 - What's wrong with "Beryl"?
###3685 We happen to know that your name is Sylvia, Mrs. Chapman.
###3688 - What are you talking about?
###3690 - We live in Budleigh Salterton,
###3692 not this...Lichfield place.
###3695 - You have proof of that, I suppose.
###3697 - Well, no, I haven't--
###3699 Yes, I have.
###3701 - Watch him, Beddoes.
###3710 What's this?
###3712 - Our wedding lines, if you must know.
###3714 - We were married this morning.
###3792 - I swear by almighty God
###3794 that the evidence I shall give
###3796 shall be the truth, the whole truth,
###3798 and nothing but the truth.
###3803 - You are Mr. John Leatheran?
###3806 - Yes, sir.
###3807 - And you are a dentist.
###3809 - Yes, sir.
###3810 I've taken over the dental practice
###3812 of the late Mr. Henry Morley at 168 Harley Street.
###3815 - I see.
###3817 You were recently called
###3819 to examine the body of the deceased
###3821 for purposes of identification.
###3826 Were you not?
###3827 - I was, sir.
###3829 The police believed the body
###3830 to be that of Miss Mabelle Sainsbury Seale,
###3832 who was a patient of Mr. Morley's.
###3834 - I see.
###3836 You've inherited, as it were, the late Mr. Morley's patients.
###3840 - That's right, sir.
###3841 - And, of course, their dental records.
###3843 - Quite.
###3844 - And could you identify the body from these records?
###3848 - I could, sir.
###3849 It was not Miss Sainsbury Seale.
###3852 It was Mrs. Sylvia Chapman, another patient of Mr. Morley's.
###3870 - The fair Mabelle put one over on us
###3872 good and proper.
###3873 I wouldn't have thought she was capable of murder,
###3876 but that's what it looks like now.
###3877 Sylvia didn't murder Mabelle; Mabelle murdered Sylvia.
###3881 - Perhaps.
###3883 - It crossed my mind that Morley might have been killed
###3886 so he couldn't identify the body.
###3888 - But, as you have just heard, Chief Inspector,
###3890 the records would still have existed.
###3892 - That's right.
###3894 Anyway, I'm going back to work.
###3896 - Oh, Chief Inspector.
###3897 This morning, I received a letter from Monsieur Blunt.
###3900 He has invited me to his house in the country.
###3903 He may have a commission for me.
###3905 - Well, you always did move in exalted circles, Poirot.
###3922 - Helen isn't dining with us tonight?
###3924 - I suggested that it would be far better for her to rest
###3929 than to go to all the bother of dressing herself up
###3932 and coming down.
###3933 She saw my point.
###3936 - Oh?
###3938 I thought it might make a pleasant change for her.
###3940 - I really don't see why you need a secretary
###3944 during the weekend anyway.
###3948 - She's new to the job.
###3950 There's a lot she needs to learn.
###3962 Monsieur Poirot?
###3967 There is a great deal about which
###3968 I am not entirely satisfied.
###3972 - What do you want of me, Monsieur Blunt?
###3976 - I want you to find this woman Sainsbury Seale.
###3979 - Alive or dead?
###3983 - You think she may be dead.
###3992 - I think...
###3994 She might be dead, yes.
###3996 - Why do you think so?
###4001 - Because of a pair of new silk stockings I discovered.
###4009 You're an odd man, Monsieur Poirot.
###4011 - Oh, yes, I am.
###4013 Very odd.
###4015 That is to say, I am methodical, orderly, and logical,
###4021 and I do not like to distort facts
###4023 to support a theory.
###4062 Good morning.
###4099 - Good morning, Monsieur Poirot.
###4100 Did you sleep well?
###4102 - Excellently. Thank you, Monsieur Blunt.
###4104 Good morning, mademoiselle.
###4105 - Good morning, Mr. Poirot.
###4110 I would prefer not to accept any invitations, Mr. Blunt,
###4113 while your American relations are with you.
###4122 - Good morning.
###4124 Julia.
###4126 I'm afraid you rather hurt Helen's feelings.
###4128 - Oh, for heaven's sake, Alistair.
###4130 She's only a secretary.
###4139 - I notice that you have a gardener
###4142 who you must have employed recently.
###4145 - Yes, we took one on a couple of weeks ago.
###4148 - Do you know from where he came?
###4151 - I'm afraid not.
###4153 MacAlister, the head gardener, engaged him.
###4155 - Oh. What is his name?
###4157 - Well, I don't know.
###4159 Dunning, Sunbury, something of the sort.
###4168 - Seems like lots of people
###4169 are out for your blood, Uncle Alistair.
###4171 - Oh, really? What are you reading?
###4175 Oh, the debate in the House.
###4177 That's only Archerton.
###4178 If we'd let him have his way,
###4180 England would be bankrupt within a week.
###4182 - Did you know there are over 2 million unemployed
###4184 in this country?
###4186 - One can't make an omelet without breaking eggs, Jane.
###4189 - I think we do pretty well, all things considered.
###4192 Industrial production was up 3% last year.
###4195 - Take no notice of what Jane says.
###4199 You know what girls are.
###4201 They go to these parties in studios,
###4204 and then they come home and talk a lot of nonsense.
###4206 - Mother.
###4208 - I'm afraid I'm one of the last of the old guard,
###4211 Monsieur Poirot.
###4212 - And if the old guard should be removed,
###4217 what would happen?
###4218 - Removed?
###4220 I'll tell you.
###4222 A lot of damn fools
###4223 would try a lot of very costly experiments.
###4225 It would be the end of stability,
###4227 of common sense, and of solvency.
###4230 - Ah.
###4242 Of course, we've always taken great pride
###4244 in our herbaceous borders here.
###4246 They're a lot of work, mind,
###4247 but well worth the effort, I've always thought.
###4249 - Ah, now, these flowers here, they are beautiful.
###4252 - Yes, they're particularly good this year.
###4254 And look at these here.
###4256 Good god!
###4260 - Drop that gun!
###4261 - It wasn't me, I tell you.
###4262 - Oh, no? Just shooting at the birds, I suppose.
###4264 Oh, Mr. Blunt!
###4266 I caught him right at it.
###4268 - I was just weeding the beds.
###4271 I heard a shot, the gun fell right at my feet,
###4273 I picked it up, and this stupid cow jumped on me.
###4275 - Now, then, Dunning, Dunbury--
###4277 what is your name?
###4278 - His name is Frank Carter.
###4280 - You.
###4282 You've had it in for me all along.
###4283 I never fired that shot!
###4285 - In that case, who did?
###4287 As you can see, there is no one else here
###4291 but ourselves.
###4320 You really must not agitate yourself, Mademoiselle Neville.
###4325 - First they tried to pretend
###4326 that Frank attempted to murder Mr. Blunt,
###4329 and now they've accused him of murdering poor Mr. Morley.
###4334 - Sugar?
###4335 - No, thank you.
###4338 - I was down there, you know, at Exsham,
###4341 when the shot was fired at Monsieur Blunt.
###4343 - It's these Blackshirts.
###4346 They march around waving their banners.
###4348 They have this ridiculous salute.
###4350 And they work up these poor men like Frank until they think
###4354 they're doing something wonderful and patriotic.
###4356 - And that is the defense of Monsieur Carter?
###4359 - No! I haven't seen him, of course.
###4361 They wouldn't let me.
###4362 - Buh-buh-buh-buh-buh-buh.
###4374 - He has a solicitor working for him,
###4377 and he told me what Frank had said.
###4380 He met a man in a public house
###4384 who said he was in the secret service,
###4387 and he offered Frank this wonderful job.
###4392 He was to take up the post of gardener
###4396 and listen to all the other gardeners' conversations
###4399 and sound them out as to their Red tendencies.
###4404 He had to pretend to be a bit of a Red himself.
###4406 - And this solicitor, he is of the opinion
###4410 that his client would do better
###4412 to think of a story that is more plausible?
###4414 - Lawyers.
###4417 You wouldn't believe how difficult they are.
###4423 - Mademoiselle Neville.
###4426 What did you think of the housemaid, Agnes?
###4429 - I didn't think at all about her.
###4433 Mr. Morley's sister kept a strict eye on the maids.
###4436 - Ah.
###4437 - Why are you asking?
###4440 - She wrote to me a letter, and...
###4443 As yet, I do not know why.
###4463 Thank you.
###4488 - Your tea, madam.
###4489 - Thank you.
###4491 I hope you didn't mind me writing you that letter, sir,
###4494 only I didn't want for you to come to the house.
###4497 I mean, if I was to say anything in front of Miss Morley,
###4501 she might say as how I ought to have said something before.
###4504 Me and the cook, we'd read in the papers
###4507 how the master had made a mistake with that drug
###4510 and had shot himself.
###4511 So it did seem quite clear, didn't it, sir?
###4515 - When did you begin to feel differently, Agnes?
###4517 - Seeing in the paper, sir, about that Frank Carter
###4521 shooting at that gentleman.
###4524 I mean, up till then,
###4526 neither of us thought he'd done anything to Mr. Morley.
###4530 We just thought it was a bit queer.
###4533 - What was queer, Agnes?
###4537 - It was that morning, sir.
###4539 The morning Mr. Morley shot himself.
###4541 I was wondering if I dared run down and get the post,
###4545 so I went out on the landing,
###4546 and I looked down over the stairs.
###4551 And it was then that I saw him,
###4553 Frank Carter, down on the stairs below.
###4556 He was just standing there, like, waiting.
###4560 Then he seemed to make up his mind,
###4562 and he sort of went very quickly down the stairs
###4564 towards the master's surgery.
###4567 And I thought to myself, "The master won't like that."
###4572 - Agnes!
###4574 - But just then, Cook called me,
###4576 and I went back into the kitchen.
###4578 And afterwards, I heard the master had shot himself,
###4580 and it was so awful, it just drove everything out of my head.
###4584 - Tell me, Agnes.
###4587 Did you actually see Frank Carter
###4589 enter the room of Monsieur Morley?
###4592 - He must have done, sir.
###4594 - At what time was this?
###4596 - It must have been about half past 12:00, sir.
###4617 - I want to see Frank Carter.
###4619 - What's the big idea?
###4621 - You are unwilling?
###4625 - What do you want to see Carter for?
###4628 Ask him if he really murdered Morley?
###4630 - Yes.
###4631 - I suppose you think he'll tell you if he did.
###4633 - He might tell me, yes.
###4636 - That can only mean that you've got hold of something
###4638 that proves more or less conclusively
###4639 that he didn't.
###4641 You ought to play fair with us, Poirot.
###4643 - I am playing fair with you, Chief Inspector.
###4647 Believe me.
###4669 - It's a damned lie!
###4670 You paid her to say that.
###4672 - Anger and abuse will not help you, Monsieur Carter.
###4675 Agnes is going to tell her story,
###4677 and it is going to be believed.
###4679 You were on the stairs, Agnes did see you,
###4683 and you did go into the room of Monsieur Morley.
###4685 What happened then?
###4688 - It's a lie!
###4695 - No.
###4698 It is not a lie.
###4704 If you did not kill Monsieur Morley,
###4706 your only hope is to tell me the exact truth
###4710 of what happened that morning.
###4717 - God curse you if you let me down now.
###4740 I did go in.
###4744 I went up the stairs and waited above Morley's landing
###4746 till I could be sure of getting him alone.
###4750 Then a bearded gent came out and went down the stairs.
###4753 I was just making up my mind to go
###4758 when another gent came out and went down the stairs too.
###4763 I knew I had to be quick.
###4767 I went along and nicked into his room without knocking.
###4769 I was all set to have it out with him.
###4772 But he was lying there dead,
###4774 and I could see the bullet hole in his head
###4776 where a black crust of blood ran.
###4785 He was cold.
###4790 I knew I was in a jam then.
###4793 They were going to say I'd done it.
###4802 I hadn't touched anything
###4803 except his hand and the doorknob.
###4806 I wiped that with my handkerchief,
###4807 both sides, as I went out.
###4810 There was nobody in the hall, and I let myself out
###4812 and licked it as fast as I could.
###4817 That's the truth. He was dead already.
###4819 You've got to believe me.
###4828 - By telling me the truth,
###4832 you have just saved yourself from being hanged.
###4838 - I don't see it.
###4839 They're going to say--
###4840 - Monsieur Carter.
###4842 Your story has confirmed what I knew to be the truth.
###4845 You can leave it now to me.
###4877 - Japp.
###4878 Ah, Poirot.
###4881 Yes?
###4888 What?
###4891 No, Poirot, I--
###4894 Well, I have to get clearance on this, you know.
###4899 Go on.
###4902 Yeah.
###4905 All right, I'll do what I can.
###4907 - Thank you, Chief Inspector.
###4935 - Mr. Hercule Poirot, sir.
###4938 - Thank you.
###4940 - This is about Miss Sainsbury Seale, is it?
###4942 Have you found her?
###4943 - I hope you do not object, Monsieur Blunt,
###4945 but I have invited a few other people to join us.
###4956 - I'm not walking through the streets in handcuffs.
###4959 - You'll walk through the streets
###4961 in anything I tell you, my lad.
###4968 - I hope this is a matter of importance, Alistair.
###4972 That Belgian detective sent a most insolent message to us.
###4976 - Mother.
###4994 - Miss Neville to see you, sir.
###4997 - Mademoiselle Neville.
###4999 - Are there many more, Monsieur Poirot?
###5002 If so, we may be more comfortable in the boardroom.
###5005 Is the boardroom free, Miss Montressor?
###5008 - Yes, Mr. Blunt.
###5015 - Frank!
###5021 - All right, all right.
###5022 You're still in His Majesty's custody, you know.
###5024 Show a bit of respect. Come on.
###5030 - Mesdames et messieurs,
###5034 good afternoon.
###5036 Since the beginning of this case,
###5039 three people have died:
###5040 pauvre Monsieur Morley, pauvre Monsieur Amberiotis,
###5044 and pauvre Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale.
###5047 - I thought she was still missing.
###5049 - No, no, no, no, mademoiselle.
###5051 In fact, Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale was dead
###5054 even before the investigations of this case began.
###5058 The porter at Lichfield Court told us
###5063 that Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale
###5065 had been to visit Madame Chapman.
###5068 He saw her go to the apartment and be let in.
###5071 She never came out again, no?
###5074 Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale was never, ever seen again
###5077 until the police, they broke in to the boxroom
###5080 of Madame Chapman.
###5081 - You mean it was Mabelle Sainsbury Seale's body
###5084 in that flat after all?
###5085 - Indeed it was, my dear Mademoiselle Neville.
###5088 You see, it was a very clever double bluff.
###5092 The disfigured face was meant to raise the question
###5095 of the identity of the woman.
###5098 But for me, the case, it began with a shoe.
###5105 As I left the dentist's after my séance,
###5109 a taxi stopped, a door opened,
###5112 and a foot of a woman prepared to descend.
###5116 It was a foot that was well shaped,
###5118 with a good ankle and an expensive stocking.
###5123 The shoe was new, shining patent leather
###5126 with a large, ornate buckle.
###5129 And when the rest of the lady came into sight,
###5131 to be frank, it was quite a disappointment.
###5136 As Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale descended from the taxi,
###5140 she caught her shoe buckle, and it was wrenched off.
###5146 I picked it up and returned it to her.
###5148 Not at all, madame.
###5150 - Ooh. - Oh, dear.
###5153 You are welcome, madame.
###5154 - Thank you so much.
###5158 - That was all.
###5160 The incident, it was closed.
###5166 - Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Blunt, to interrupt.
###5169 I've finished the post.
###5170 Is it all right if I leave now?
###5171 - Oh, no, no, no, no.
###5173 Please, Mademoiselle Montressor.
###5175 Please come and join the party.
###5176 - Monsieur Poirot is expounding
###5178 some extremely entertaining theories.
###5180 - Please.
###5196 - Go on, Poirot.
###5197 - Thank you.
###5200 When Chief Inspector Japp summoned me to Lichfield Court
###5204 because a body had been discovered,
###5207 the first thing that I noticed was a shabby buckled shoe.
###5213 - Well?
###5215 - Ah, you have failed to appreciate the point,
###5217 Monsieur Blunt.
###5219 It was a shabby shoe.
###5222 It was a well-worn shoe.
###5225 But, you see, Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale
###5228 visited the apartment on the evening of the same day
###5232 of the murder of Monsieur Morley.
###5233 So in the morning, they were the new shoes.
###5235 In the evening, they were the old shoes?
###5237 - I can't see why that's important.
###5240 - Eh bien, mademoiselle.
###5242 Poirot does not like things he cannot explain.
###5247 Madame Chapman took a size five in shoes.
###5252 I knew that Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale
###5254 wore a ten-inch stocking.
###5256 That is to say, she took at least a size six in shoes.
###5261 So I went back to reexamine the body.
###5265 My idea was that the face had been disfigured
###5268 to hide the fact
###5270 that it really was the body of Madame Chapman
###5273 dressed in the clothes of Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale.
###5276 No, the shoe on the body was size six,
###5281 so it looked as if it was the body
###5283 of Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale after all.
###5286 But then why was the face so disfigured?
###5291 By coincidence, the dentist of Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale
###5294 was also the dentist of Madame Chapman:
###5297 Monsieur Morley.
###5298 But he was dead.
###5301 However, the records, they would have still existed, huh?
###5304 So the successor to Monsieur Morley
###5306 would have been able to positively identify the body
###5308 as that of Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale.
###5310 - And could you identify the body from these records?
###5314 - I could, sir.
###5315 It was not Miss Sainsbury Seale.
###5317 It was Mrs. Sylvia Chapman, another patient of Mr. Morley's.
###5321 - But if it was the body of Madame Chapman,
###5324 why was she dressed in the clothes
###5326 of Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale?
###5330 An interesting problem, n'est-ce pas?
###5334 So I cast my mind back
###5337 to the Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale whom I had met,
###5340 whom the Chief Inspector Japp had met.
###5342 - I used to be an actress.
###5344 Just small parts, you know.
###5346 Then I went on a world tour, and--
###5349 - And although everything about her
###5351 and everything she said
###5352 was in perfect accord with her given character,
###5354 I am now convinced that the Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale
###5358 whom we have met
###5359 and the Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale
###5361 who accosted you, Monsieur Blunt...
###5363 - You don't remember me. Mabelle.
###5365 Gerda and I were on tour together.
###5367 - They were not the same woman.
###5369 - You mean Miss Sainsbury Seale was murdered
###5372 and someone else took over her identity?
###5374 - Précisément.
###5377 Again, that is very dangerous, n'est-ce pas?
###5382 But the rewards, they were very high.
###5387 - Rewards?
###5389 What rewards?
###5391 - In just one moment, if you please, Madame Olivera.
###5395 - Perhaps Mr. Morley was murdered
###5398 because he would have been able to identify
###5400 Miss Sainsbury Seale's body by her teeth.
###5402 - Perhaps.
###5405 However...
###5408 Now we must face the facts.
###5415 In the beginning, we believed that the body of Monsieur Morley
###5419 was first discovered by the pageboy, Alfred,
###5421 at about 1:30.
###5424 But the fact is, I now know that the body was first discovered
###5430 by Monsieur Frank Carter about one hour earlier,
###5434 at about 12:30.
###5444 Two things occurred
###5445 between the death of Monsieur Morley
###5448 and the discovery of his body by Monsieur Carter.
###5451 The lady whose shoe buckle I retrieved
###5454 was shown into the surgery of Monsieur Morley.
###5465 While her accomplice dragged the body
###5468 into the office of the secretary,
###5470 the second Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale
###5473 changes the labels on the files of Monsieur Morley
###5476 to ensure that the body would be identified
###5480 as that of Madame Chapman.
###5484 She then leaves.
###5488 Alfred shows in the next patient
###5490 to the surgery of Monsieur Morley.
###5501 Now, Monsieur Amberiotis had never before met the dentist,
###5504 Monsieur Morley.
###5506 - It's been troubling me since the journey from India.
###5509 - So our murderer, he was able to assume his identity.
###5518 This dentist tells to Monsieur Amberiotis
###5521 that it would be best to freeze the gum.
###5527 He then administers an injection
###5529 which contains a dose of novocaine and adrenaline
###5533 which is sufficient to kill him six hours later.
###5540 - But why?
###5542 Why would anyone want to kill this man?
###5544 - Because Monsieur Amberiotis had learned something
###5547 from Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale.
###5549 He had learned a secret...
###5552 And a secret that could make him a very rich man.
###5567 - I wish to speak to Mr. Alistair Blunt.
###5570 - And Monsieur Amberiotis, he was a blackmailer.
###5577 - Are you seriously suggesting Amberiotis was blackmailing me?
###5581 - How could he blackmail Alistair?
###5584 Alistair has no secrets.
###5586 - With the greatest respect, Madame Olivera,
###5589 there I must disagree with you.
###5593 Monsieur Blunt has a very big secret,
###5595 a secret that must be kept at all costs.
###5600 And there is only one method that is totally effective
###5603 in dealing with a blackmailer, and that is to silence him...
###5608 Forever.
###5610 No, Monsieur Amberiotis, he had to go.
###5616 And Monsieur Blunt had seen the name of Monsieur Amberiotis
###5619 in the appointment book belonging to Monsieur Morley.
###5622 His blackmailer used the same dentist.
###5625 - That'll do for today, I think.
###5628 One more rinse, please.
###5633 - And so, Monsieur Blunt, you devise a clever plan,
###5636 a very clever plan indeed.
###5641 You wait until your treatment has been completed
###5644 by Monsieur Morley.
###5657 Then you shoot him.
###5668 While the dental records are being falsified,
###5671 you drag the body into the office of the secretary.
###5694 As I have said, Monsieur Amberiotis
###5697 had never before met Monsieur Morley,
###5700 so there was no reason for him to suspect anything.
###5709 You administer to him the fatal injection.
###5717 And when he has left, you drag the body of Monsieur Morley
###5721 back into the surgery...
###5724 And arrange it to look like suicide.
###5744 - I know, Monsieur Poirot, you have a great reputation.
###5748 But I'm afraid in this case,
###5750 you are wrong to a lunatic degree.
###5753 - Send him about his business, Alistair.
###5756 Mr. Blunt's family stands foursquare behind him.
###5761 - I am very pleased to hear it, Madame Olivera.
###5765 But, you see,
###5767 when Monsieur Blunt married your sister,
###5770 Mademoiselle Rebecca Arnholt,
###5774 he was not entirely honest with her, no,
###5776 nor with her family,
###5778 because, as Monsieur Amberiotis learned
###5781 from the real Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale,
###5784 Monsieur Blunt was already married.
###5789 - Look, there's no need for the rest of you
###5792 to listen to any more of this.
###5794 If you-- - No, no, no, Monsieur Blunt.
###5795 You were dazzled by the Arnholt family,
###5797 by the vista not so much of wealth but of power.
###5800 And so dazzled were you that you deliberately committed a bigamy
###5804 and your real wife acquiesced in the situation.
###5806 - Oh, what rot!
###5808 - What a fine portrait is this, Monsieur Blunt!
###5811 Such a portrait would be to any boardroom an ornament!
###5814 Monsieur Blunt standing beside his beloved wife,
###5817 the former Mademoiselle Rebecca Arnholt!
###5822 However, mesdames et messieurs,
###5826 I have here in my pocket
###5832 a certificate of marriage
###5835 between Martin Alistair Blunt
###5838 and an actress by the name of
###5839 Mademoiselle Gerda Alexandra Grant
###5843 dated April the 25th, 1925.
###5849 And Mademoiselle Gerda Grant is still very much alive.
###5855 Yes.
###5858 Indeed, she is in this very room.
###5879 - And when I lived, I was your other wife.
###5882 And when you loved, you were my other husband.
###5886 Husband.
###5888 - Which is Beatrice?
###5889 - I answer to that name.
###5892 What is your will?
###5894 - Do not you love me?
###5895 - Why, no, no more than reason.
###5899 Don't be so mamby-pamby, Mabelle.
###5901 You think he's not good enough for me.
###5904 Come on, Alistair. I want to dance!
###5907 Dance, dance, dance.
###5915 - Gerda got such a kick out of it all.
###5917 Didn't you, old girl?
###5934 - It was your skills as an actress,
###5936 Mademoiselle Montressor,
###5939 that were the key to the deception.
###5942 You connived at the bigamy of your husband.
###5945 While he set about marrying into the Arnholt family,
###5949 you assumed the identity of Madame Sylvia Chapman.
###5952 - After all these years!
###5955 - Hello, Mabelle.
###5957 Come in.
###5958 - I've brought you some flowers.
###5961 - When the real Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale
###5962 met again your husband,
###5964 you murder your old friend in cold blood.
###5969 - Go into the sitting room straight through there.
###5975 - But your skills as an actress are put to the test once again
###5978 as the second Mademoiselle Sainsbury Seale.
###5981 - Ooh!
###5986 So kind.
###5988 - Not at all, madame.
###5990 - Ooh!
###5991 - Unfortunately for you, it was Hercule Poirot
###5994 who retrieved your shoe buckle that day.
###6000 But having safely deceived
###6002 the Chief Inspector Japp and myself,
###6004 or so you thought,
###6007 you took the opportunity to be as close as possible
###6009 to your husband.
###6010 You assumed the name of Helen Montressor
###6015 and joined him as his new, efficient secretary.
###6021 - We'll never make these people understand, will we, my darling?
###6025 Such ordinary, unimaginative people.
###6030 I wish I could make you understand, Monsieur Poirot,
###6033 about my meeting with Rebecca and my marriage.
###6035 Gerda understood, didn't you, old girl?
###6039 We could have married again after Rebecca's death,
###6041 but, do you know, we'd come to rather enjoy all the secrecy.
###6046 She's an actress through and through.
###6048 She would have found it very dull
###6050 being just one character.
###6052 Well...
###6054 I've killed three people,
###6056 so presumably I ought to hang.
###6058 But haven't I done something for England?
###6061 I have held it firm.
###6063 I have kept it solvent.
###6064 I have kept it free from dictators.
###6068 I am necessary
###6070 to the continuing peace and well-being of this nation.
###6073 - Is he saying what I think he's saying?
###6075 - What about me?
###6077 He was gonna let me hang.
###6079 - Précisément.
###6082 Monsieur Blunt, with his usual efficiency,
###6086 had provided for himself a second line of defense.
###6089 If things went wrong, you, Monsieur Carter,
###6092 you were to be the scapegoat.
###6097 You see, by now, Monsieur Blunt knows
###6100 of Monsieur Morley's opinion regarding you,
###6103 and so he arranges for you to be engaged
###6106 in a most mysterious fashion as a gardener.
###6110 Ah, now, these flowers here, they are beautiful.
###6113 And how easy for Helen Montressor
###6115 to fire a shot vaguely in your direction,
###6118 drop the pistol at your feet,
###6121 where you are bound to pick it up?
###6122 - Drop that gun! Help!
###6125 Oh, Mr. Blunt!
###6126 - You are caught red-handed,
###6128 and of course nobody is going to believe your story,
###6131 your ridiculous story
###6133 about being employed by the secret service.
###6136 No.
###6138 As far as Monsieur Blunt is concerned,
###6141 you can end your short life on the gallows.
###6144 - I don't waste pity on people like him.
###6149 - Eh bien, Monsieur Blunt.
###6151 That is where you and I, we do not see alike,
###6153 for to me, the lives of those three people
###6157 are just as important as your own life.
###6166 Monsieur Blunt,
###6167 you talk of the continued peace of this nation, huh?
###6171 Oh, yes, that is very good.
###6174 But Poirot is not concerned with nations.
###6177 Poirot is concerned with private individuals,
###6182 who have the right not to have taken from them their lives.
###6189 - Martin Alistair Blunt and Gerda Alexandra Blunt,
###6194 I arrest you on charges of murder.
###6203 - Please.
###6221 Oh, my--my poor dear sister.
###6230 I don't know why I'm crying.
###6234 - Come on, Mother.
###6236 - I never liked him anyway.
###6240 - Why don't we go back home?
###6243 To New York.
###6254 - That could have been me, you know.
###6257 - I think I'm going to keep a close eye on you in future,
###6260 Frank Carter.
###6261 You're not safe out on your own.
###6264 Secret service.
###6277 - Look at it, Poirot,
###6279 the trappings of wealth and power.
###6282 And yet underneath it all...
###6284 - Yes, Chief Inspector?
###6285 - Well, I mean, it just shows you, doesn't it?
###6287 They're no better than we are when it comes down to it.
###6290 It's the little chaps
###6291 that keep things on an even keel,
###6293 chaps like you and me.
###6295 - Ah.
###6296 But there are no little chaps, Chief Inspector,
###6300 particularly not Poirot.
