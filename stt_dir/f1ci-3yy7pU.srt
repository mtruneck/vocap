1
0:0:35,88 --> 0:0:48,16
You want a piece of me ? Come get some.


2
0:0:48,16 --> 0:0:56,76
Heads up.


3
0:0:56,76 --> 0:0:58,92
Oh, shit !


4
0:0:58,92 --> 0:1:2,2
- Oh, hiya.
- Don't sneak up on me like that !


5
0:1:2,2 --> 0:1:4,84
Ooohh ! Do you want a cup of tea ?


6
0:1:4,84 --> 0:1:35,12
Yes.


7
0:1:35,12 --> 0:1:37,36
- There's your tea.
- Thank you.


8
0:1:37,36 --> 0:1:39,84
- You're up early.
- I haven't been to bed.


9
0:1:39,84 --> 0:1:43,36
Me and Mike met up with two Scottish guys
in the pub and they gave us cheap speed.


10
0:1:43,36 --> 0:1:45,68
<i>Oh, Tim, that's so tacky.</i>


11
0:1:45,68 --> 0:1:47,76
I know. They were so nice.


12
0:1:47,76 --> 0:1:51,8
If we'd have said no, they'd have got offended
and beaten us to death with a pool cue.


13
0:1:51,8 --> 0:1:59,28
Where's Mike now ?


14
0:1:59,28 --> 0:2:1,32
Is there any post ?


15
0:2:1,32 --> 0:2:7,2
- I did hear droppage.
- I'm gonna go and get my rejection letters.


16
0:2:7,2 --> 0:2:10,24
I met this really, really nice girl last night.


17
0:2:10,24 --> 0:2:13,72
Shh ! I'm supposed to be your girlfriend.


18
0:2:13,72 --> 0:2:17,76
- Marsha might hear.
- Don't be daft !


19
0:2:17,76 --> 0:2:22,24
- You never know who's listening.
- Nobody's listening.


20
0:2:22,24 --> 0:2:29,4
<i>- You never know who's listening,
- Nobody's listening,</i>


21
0:2:29,4 --> 0:2:31,92
So who was this girl, then ?


22
0:2:31,92 --> 0:2:37,68
Her name was Cassandra, she was
a psychic, she gave me her phone number.


23
0:2:37,68 --> 0:2:40,44
That's our phone number.


24
0:2:40,44 --> 0:2:44,52
Man, she's good.


25
0:2:44,52 --> 0:2:47,88
Rejection, rejection, rejection.


26
0:2:47,88 --> 0:2:52,28
<i>This is shit ! This is so shit !</i>


27
0:2:52,28 --> 0:2:56,4
I'm a good writer, you know ?
All I want is a chance to prove it.


28
0:2:56,4 --> 0:2:58,8
Yeah ? Too much to ask ?


29
0:2:58,8 --> 0:3:2,56
Oh, I really miss my boyfriend.


30
0:3:2,56 --> 0:3:5,64
I'm gonna go to Hull to see Richard.


31
0:3:5,64 --> 0:3:9,88
Don't try and stop me, Tim. OK ?
I really need this.


32
0:3:9,88 --> 0:3:13,0
<i>Oh ! It's from Flaps  !</i>


33
0:3:13,0 --> 0:3:15,2
- Who ?
- The woman's magazine.


34
0:3:15,2 --> 0:3:18,2
I've got an interview today !
I'd better get ready.


35
0:3:18,2 --> 0:3:22,44
- What about Richard ?
- Who ? Right, I'm gonna go to the shops.


36
0:3:22,44 --> 0:3:24,96
- Do you want anything ?
- Porn !


37
0:3:24,96 --> 0:3:26,52
Tim, I'm not gonna buy you porn.


38
0:3:26,52 --> 0:3:29,4
You can get it from railway sidings
like everybody else.


39
0:3:29,4 --> 0:3:34,84
I can't, I'm an adult.
I'm supposed to leave it there.


40
0:3:34,84 --> 0:3:40,88
Oh, hi, Bri !


41
0:3:40,88 --> 0:3:47,12
Brought your mop back.


42
0:3:47,12 --> 0:3:50,56
What are you playing ?


43
0:3:50,56 --> 0:3:55,52
It's a subtle blend of lateral thinking
and extreme violence.


44
0:3:55,52 --> 0:3:59,88
What, like It's A Knockout ?


45
0:3:59,88 --> 0:4:2,68
Did you want something ?


46
0:4:2,68 --> 0:4:6,32
No. Not really.


47
0:4:6,32 --> 0:4:10,2
Oh, there's a letter here for you.
Came yesterday.


48
0:4:10,2 --> 0:4:12,4
It's open.


49
0:4:12,4 --> 0:4:35,8
Yeah. I opened it by accident
because we've both got I's in our names.


50
0:4:35,8 --> 0:4:38,52
- It's from Vulva.
- Is that another woman's magazine ?


51
0:4:38,52 --> 0:4:41,92
Vulva, it's an old friend.
She's having a show tonight.


52
0:4:41,92 --> 0:4:44,32
You've got a friend called Vulva ?
Who's called Vulva ?


53
0:4:44,32 --> 0:4:47,76
<i>- Her real name's lan.
- What do you mean her real name's lan ?</i>


54
0:4:47,76 --> 0:4:50,72
- She's non-gender specific.
- What, you mean he's a tranny ?


55
0:4:50,72 --> 0:4:53,52
- More than that.
- What, a big, fat tranny ?


56
0:4:53,52 --> 0:5:0,24
Vulva. We had a multimedia performance-art
partnership before she moved on.


57
0:5:0,24 --> 0:5:5,52
Such aesthetic wonders. Such vibrant times.


58
0:5:5,52 --> 0:5:16,64
Yeah, I can imagine.


59
0:5:16,64 --> 0:5:26,12
No. No, no. We did valuable work.


60
0:5:26,12 --> 0:5:31,48
<i>She was the beautiful one, really,
I just danced to her tune,</i>


61
0:5:31,48 --> 0:5:33,52
It was purity.


62
0:5:33,52 --> 0:5:38,8
It was physical. Not in a sexual sense,
no, we were collaborative.


63
0:5:38,8 --> 0:5:44,4
I don't expect you to understand. Most people
don't want to hear, they just switch off.


64
0:5:44,4 --> 0:5:48,16
It's hard to hear the story of a love affair
between two straight men,


65
0:5:48,16 --> 0:5:53,88
one of whom is the most divine woman alive.


66
0:5:53,88 --> 0:5:56,56
So, are you gonna go ?


67
0:5:56,56 --> 0:6:2,28
- I don't know, I haven't seen her for ages.
- No, I meant are you gonna go now ?


68
0:6:2,28 --> 0:6:10,28
Oh, yeah.


69
0:6:10,28 --> 0:6:19,56
<i>Research, research, research, research,
research, research, research,</i>


70
0:6:19,56 --> 0:6:25,96
<i>Clothes, clothes, ideas, clothes,,,</i>


71
0:6:25,96 --> 0:6:42,92
<i>Clothes, ideas, photographers,,, and,,, ooh !</i>


72
0:6:42,92 --> 0:6:44,96
Right.


73
0:6:44,96 --> 0:6:48,28
Current affairs, right. Ooh, current affairs.


74
0:6:48,28 --> 0:6:50,2
OK. What do you think about...


75
0:6:50,2 --> 0:6:54,12
What do you think about current affairs,
Daisy ?


76
0:6:54,12 --> 0:6:58,4
What do I think about them ?
Erm, well, I like them. I think they're good.


77
0:6:58,4 --> 0:7:0,44
Right. What shall I wear ?


78
0:7:0,44 --> 0:7:4,4
- I think you should dress like a lesbian.
- How do lesbians dress ?


79
0:7:4,4 --> 0:7:6,12
Kind of like Suzi Quatro ?


80
0:7:6,12 --> 0:7:8,8
It's not really a lesbian magazine.


81
0:7:8,8 --> 0:7:12,8
It's more for modern, go-getting women
with something to say, women like...


82
0:7:12,8 --> 0:7:15,6
- Suzi Quatro ?
- No ! Like me.


83
0:7:15,6 --> 0:7:20,44
I'm not sure if I should go casual or strappy.
Reliable and frumpy or stupid and glamorous.


84
0:7:20,44 --> 0:7:22,8
Why don't you go something in-between ?


85
0:7:22,8 --> 0:7:24,2
- Frumpy and stupid.
- Save you getting ready.


86
0:7:24,2 --> 0:7:28,4
- Tim, I'm serious ! This is important, I've...
- Look ! Daisy...


87
0:7:28,4 --> 0:7:33,88
Daisy, Daisy, Daisy.


88
0:7:33,88 --> 0:7:36,16
It's gonna be OK.


89
0:7:36,16 --> 0:7:40,56
Now have a big toke on this South African
drugs-reefer-style spliff doobie.


90
0:7:40,56 --> 0:7:45,0
I dunno. Might make me paranoid.


91
0:7:45,0 --> 0:7:53,6
Oh, all right.


92
0:7:53,6 --> 0:8:1,72
(Music from Psycho)


93
0:8:1,72 --> 0:8:4,72
You all right ?


94
0:8:4,72 --> 0:8:21,96
Yeah.


95
0:8:21,96 --> 0:8:25,4
I nearly didn't make it. I was followed
most of the way here by a squirrel.


96
0:8:25,4 --> 0:8:27,76
Must have seen it six or seven times.


97
0:8:27,76 --> 0:8:34,92
Maybe it was six or seven different squirrels.


98
0:8:34,92 --> 0:8:37,92
- I like your shoes.
- They're Patrick Cox's.


99
0:8:37,92 --> 0:8:40,6
Oh, right. Borrowed them. Yeah.


100
0:8:40,6 --> 0:8:42,96
Small feet for a bloke.


101
0:8:42,96 --> 0:8:49,96
Oh, give Josh a big kiss for me.
See you Saturday. Daisy Steiner ?


102
0:8:49,96 --> 0:8:57,96
Hiya, Linda ! Be with you in a minute.
Love the shoes. Patrick Cox's ?


103
0:8:57,96 --> 0:9:13,6
Maybe you should try buying your own shoes
in future.


104
0:9:13,6 --> 0:9:16,56
Hello, Vulva.


105
0:9:16,56 --> 0:9:19,64
So... come.


106
0:9:19,64 --> 0:9:21,92
Hi.


107
0:9:21,92 --> 0:9:23,64
Erm...


108
0:9:23,64 --> 0:9:30,44
Hello ! Shit.


109
0:9:30,44 --> 0:9:35,48
Hello, Vulva.


110
0:9:35,48 --> 0:9:38,36
Yeah, hi, Vulva. Nice invitation.


111
0:9:38,36 --> 0:9:41,48
Mm ? ! Oh, yeah, yeah. Hi, Vulva.


112
0:9:41,48 --> 0:9:44,4
Vulva ! Hi ! How are you ? How... ?


113
0:9:44,4 --> 0:9:48,44
<i>How are you ? How are you ?
How,,, are,,, you ?</i>


114
0:9:48,44 --> 0:9:51,56
Brian, painter. Damien... Damien... ?


115
0:9:51,56 --> 0:9:53,56
Damien Hirst, hi, it's Brian.


116
0:9:53,56 --> 0:9:56,12
Vulva, I'm talking to Damien.


117
0:9:56,12 --> 0:9:59,2
Is it water with the sheep in the box ?


118
0:9:59,2 --> 0:10:2,92
No, I paint. Lots of work with... paint.


119
0:10:2,92 --> 0:10:6,48
I do big... big... big...


120
0:10:6,48 --> 0:10:9,8
Fucking loser. Yeah, yeah, big loser.


121
0:10:9,8 --> 0:10:12,0
Brian, painter, loser.


122
0:10:12,0 --> 0:10:16,68
<i>Big, fucking,,, loser !</i>


123
0:10:16,68 --> 0:10:19,12
Just...


124
0:10:19,12 --> 0:10:25,56
Take a seat.


125
0:10:25,56 --> 0:10:28,4
Daisy, is it ?


126
0:10:28,4 --> 0:10:30,72
Ah. Like a little flower.


127
0:10:30,72 --> 0:10:33,44
Right, I'm Yolanda.


128
0:10:33,44 --> 0:10:36,88
This is Tracy, who is our stylist,
and Catherine who is Head of Marketing,


129
0:10:36,88 --> 0:10:39,92
and you've already met Sarah,
she's Administration.


130
0:10:39,92 --> 0:10:44,0
The position requires you to work closely
with Michelle and Tara


131
0:10:44,0 --> 0:10:47,44
who are busy working on features
for our first edition


132
0:10:47,44 --> 0:10:49,56
which we're aiming to get out
by the end of the month.


133
0:10:49,56 --> 0:10:54,4
We've started our launch campaign,
have you seen it ?


134
0:10:54,4 --> 0:10:58,16
- I'm sorry.
- Have you seen the launch campaign ?


135
0:10:58,16 --> 0:11:0,0
Yes.


136
0:11:0,0 --> 0:11:3,44
Our magazine reflects the needs
of today's women.


137
0:11:3,44 --> 0:11:6,28
We want it big, hard and we want it now.


138
0:11:6,28 --> 0:11:9,2
<i>I knew I should have bought
Huge Fat Cocks,</i>


139
0:11:9,2 --> 0:11:12,44
We need to know whether you feel,
as someone working for our magazine,


140
0:11:12,44 --> 0:11:16,72
you could honestly and intelligently
reflect the needs of our demographic,...


141
0:11:16,72 --> 0:11:18,8
..the 20-40-year-old-woman
who doesn't say no,


142
0:11:18,8 --> 0:11:28,52
who sees her home interiors
the same way she sees her life...


143
0:11:28,52 --> 0:11:30,4
..spunk !


144
0:11:30,4 --> 0:11:34,2
We don't want you to pigeonhole yourself
but would you call yourself a postfeminist ?


145
0:11:34,2 --> 0:11:35,92
Um...  ?


146
0:11:35,92 --> 0:11:39,6
Let me put it this way,
do you drink pints or shots ?


147
0:11:39,6 --> 0:11:43,36
Well, I do drink a pint, I will drink a pint,


148
0:11:43,36 --> 0:11:47,2
but I've been known to drink
a vodka and tonic, you know,


149
0:11:47,2 --> 0:11:50,24
at a wedding, or...


150
0:11:50,24 --> 0:11:54,2
Well,... thanks for coming.


151
0:11:54,2 --> 0:12:0,76
It's been really useful.


152
0:12:0,76 --> 0:12:3,92
Right, well...


153
0:12:3,92 --> 0:12:9,4
Girl power !


154
0:12:9,4 --> 0:12:11,8
Don't write me off, Vulva.


155
0:12:11,8 --> 0:12:13,88
I can be...


156
0:12:13,88 --> 0:12:15,76
conceptual.


157
0:12:15,76 --> 0:12:19,2
I'm sorry, Brian.


158
0:12:19,2 --> 0:12:21,84
- Please.
- It's your work.


159
0:12:21,84 --> 0:12:46,12
Abstract expressionism
is so mid-to-late '80s.


160
0:12:46,12 --> 0:12:49,48
'There's no reason for us to stay
any longer than necessary.'


161
0:12:49,48 --> 0:12:59,28
'Let's split up, look for any survivors
and get out of here.'


162
0:12:59,28 --> 0:13:4,16
Hey !


163
0:13:4,16 --> 0:13:7,8
- How did it go ?
- Yeah, great. It went well, actually.


164
0:13:7,8 --> 0:13:10,52
- Anyone phone ?
- Your boyfriend.


165
0:13:10,52 --> 0:13:19,68
- Anyone important ?
- No.


166
0:13:19,68 --> 0:13:22,76
You know when you said it went well ?


167
0:13:22,76 --> 0:13:25,8
Well, when you said "well",


168
0:13:25,8 --> 0:13:29,88
- did you mean shite ?
- Yes.


169
0:13:29,88 --> 0:13:33,72
I froze up. I just... made a tit of myself.


170
0:13:33,72 --> 0:13:37,2
How much of a tit ?


171
0:13:37,2 --> 0:13:41,96
I said... "girl power".


172
0:13:41,96 --> 0:13:45,8
Did you do this ?


173
0:13:45,8 --> 0:13:49,28
Yes.


174
0:13:49,28 --> 0:13:52,88
Well, I mean, you know,
you might have impressed them.


175
0:13:52,88 --> 0:13:55,72
How ?


176
0:13:55,72 --> 0:13:57,76
- Tim !
- Yeah, I'm thinking.


177
0:13:57,76 --> 0:14:0,8
Oh, shit ! Shitting shit it !


178
0:14:0,8 --> 0:14:8,6
Oh, don't be so dramatic, you don't know for
definite you haven't got it. They might phone.


179
0:14:8,6 --> 0:14:11,72
Well, pick it up, then !


180
0:14:11,72 --> 0:14:16,92
Hello ? Oh, hi, Mike. Yeah, he's here,
I'll just get him. It's your boyfriend.


181
0:14:16,92 --> 0:14:19,12
He's not my boyfriend.


182
0:14:19,12 --> 0:14:21,4
- Hi, babe.


183
0:14:21,4 --> 0:14:23,8
- Hello, Timmy.
- 'Where are you ?'


184
0:14:23,8 --> 0:14:25,4
- Er, Sheffield.
- What are you doing in Sheffield ?


185
0:14:25,4 --> 0:14:28,76
- Fell asleep on the tube.
- The tube doesn't go to Sheffield.


186
0:14:28,76 --> 0:14:34,48
- Yeah, I must have changed at King's Cross.
- Well, don't fall asleep on the way back, OK ?


187
0:14:34,48 --> 0:14:36,48
'Mike ?'


188
0:14:36,48 --> 0:14:41,16
Mike !


189
0:14:41,16 --> 0:14:45,28
What is it with you two ?
You sound like his dad sometimes.


190
0:14:45,28 --> 0:15:0,44
Well, it's a long story.


191
0:15:0,44 --> 0:15:2,64
Hello ? Brian ?


192
0:15:2,64 --> 0:15:4,96
No, he's the weirdo downstairs.


193
0:15:4,96 --> 0:15:8,96
Oh ! Sorry, Brian ! Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Come up. OK, bye.


194
0:15:8,96 --> 0:15:10,44
Brian's coming up.


195
0:15:10,44 --> 0:15:11,68
Why did he phone ?


196
0:15:11,68 --> 0:15:15,36
I don't know,
why did he paint his arse blue last week ?


197
0:15:15,36 --> 0:15:19,24
- You don't like him, do you ?
- I do, I just think he's a bit pretentious.


198
0:15:19,24 --> 0:15:21,28
How do I look ?


199
0:15:21,28 --> 0:15:23,84
- A bit pretentious ?
- I think you look lovely, Brian.


200
0:15:23,84 --> 0:15:26,52
Do you think I should lose the waistcoat ?


201
0:15:26,52 --> 0:15:31,4
I think you should burn it, cos, you know,
if you lose it, you might find it again.


202
0:15:31,4 --> 0:15:33,44
Are you going out, Bri ?


203
0:15:33,44 --> 0:15:36,36
<i>Yeah, he's gonna see
his transsexual ex-boylgirlfriend's new play.</i>


204
0:15:36,36 --> 0:15:41,4
Oh, that sounds great ! Oh, we'll come !
You'll come, won't you, Tim ?


205
0:15:41,4 --> 0:15:43,68
- No way, it's not my cup of tea.
- No, it isn't.


206
0:15:43,68 --> 0:15:46,12
Oh, come on, Bri, it'll be great, it'll be fun.


207
0:15:46,12 --> 0:15:50,32
You'll hate it. It's just a bit of art,
load of wankers, influential people.


208
0:15:50,32 --> 0:15:52,52
- Free booze, though !
- Mm, yeah.


209
0:15:52,52 --> 0:15:55,16
OK, let's go to the theatre.


210
0:15:55,16 --> 0:15:57,88
You can come if you want
but you probably won't get in.


211
0:15:57,88 --> 0:16:0,4
There's three of us,
we've only got one invitation.


212
0:16:0,4 --> 0:16:3,68
That's OK. Go on, in you go.
There's not that many here.


213
0:16:3,68 --> 0:16:8,72
- They haven't got tickets.
- Look, mate, I've told you, you can go in.


214
0:16:8,72 --> 0:16:10,76
It's ridiculous, they haven't even been invited.


215
0:16:10,76 --> 0:16:14,4
Just leave it, Brian.
Let's just go in, it'll be fine.


216
0:16:14,4 --> 0:16:17,6
We're not gonna embarrass you,
we're here if you need us.


217
0:16:17,6 --> 0:16:30,84
OK. Sorry. Sorry.


218
0:16:30,84 --> 0:16:31,76
Hello !


219
0:16:31,76 --> 0:16:33,76
- Shit !
- Hi !


220
0:16:33,76 --> 0:16:36,48
- What you doin' here ?
- Oh, we just came with Brian.


221
0:16:36,48 --> 0:16:38,12
Oh, how wonderful !


222
0:16:38,12 --> 0:16:42,28
- So how's it all goin' with the flat ?
- It's fine.


223
0:16:42,28 --> 0:16:49,92
Sorry, you come here for a big night out
and there's your landlady spying on you.


224
0:16:49,92 --> 0:16:52,76
Hello, Brian.
Haven't seen you for a long while.


225
0:16:52,76 --> 0:16:55,4
Been painting.


226
0:16:55,4 --> 0:16:59,36
You've just been trying to avoid me,
haven't ya ?


227
0:16:59,36 --> 0:17:22,24
The show's starting.


228
0:17:22,24 --> 0:17:27,8
- Hey !
- Sh !


229
0:17:27,8 --> 0:17:29,2
Macro...


230
0:17:29,2 --> 0:17:32,72
biotic !


231
0:17:32,72 --> 0:17:34,6
Dust me clean !


232
0:17:34,6 --> 0:17:38,48
A breath... alizer !


233
0:17:38,48 --> 0:17:42,28
Using... a cleaning spray.


234
0:17:42,28 --> 0:17:44,4
Knee...


235
0:17:44,4 --> 0:17:46,48
- jerk !
- Suck it in !


236
0:17:46,48 --> 0:17:48,76
Filter it out !


237
0:17:48,76 --> 0:17:56,76
Go on !


238
0:17:56,76 --> 0:18:0,96
Arrrhhhh...


239
0:18:0,96 --> 0:18:5,44
<i>Beautiful, Beautiful,</i>


240
0:18:5,44 --> 0:18:9,12
<i>I cannot believe I said "girl power",</i>


241
0:18:9,12 --> 0:18:23,0
<i>Hey, deadhead ! Take a bite of peach,</i>


242
0:18:23,0 --> 0:18:25,72
Hearing...


243
0:18:25,72 --> 0:18:31,56
aidzz.


244
0:18:31,56 --> 0:18:34,2
Fade...


245
0:18:34,2 --> 0:18:39,44
out !


246
0:18:39,44 --> 0:18:43,28
It's not finished !


247
0:18:43,28 --> 0:18:58,28
It's finished.


248
0:18:58,28 --> 0:19:3,4
- Do you mind if I put my glass there ?
- It's a free country.


249
0:19:3,4 --> 0:19:5,64
I thought... you were brilliant.


250
0:19:5,64 --> 0:19:10,68
- And who are you, then ?
- I'm Daisy Steiner, writer, sort of journalist.


251
0:19:10,68 --> 0:19:13,8
Do you know any famous
or important people ?


252
0:19:13,8 --> 0:19:16,4
My mum's cousin
went to school with Enya.


253
0:19:16,4 --> 0:19:20,52
She was in the year above
but they had the same percussion teacher.


254
0:19:20,52 --> 0:19:23,52
I hate your mum and I hate you.


255
0:19:23,52 --> 0:19:29,8
That's brilliant. Brilliant !


256
0:19:29,8 --> 0:19:33,8
- Vulva, hi.
- Brian ! You came !


257
0:19:33,8 --> 0:19:37,8
- Wouldn't have missed it for the world.
- Are you still painting ?


258
0:19:37,8 --> 0:19:40,68
Not exclusively.
I'm moving into multimedia pastures -


259
0:19:40,68 --> 0:19:45,88
installations, a platter of organic processes
mixed with a pinch of irony


260
0:19:45,88 --> 0:19:48,76
and a side helping of self-deprecation.


261
0:19:48,76 --> 0:19:51,4
Sounds delicious !


262
0:19:51,4 --> 0:20:5,64
You should see what's for pudding.


263
0:20:5,64 --> 0:20:8,0
Oh, Brian, you came.


264
0:20:8,0 --> 0:20:9,84
No, I just spilt my drink.


265
0:20:9,84 --> 0:20:13,36
So nice to see you. Are you still painting ?


266
0:20:13,36 --> 0:20:16,56
N-not... er,... multimedia,...


267
0:20:16,56 --> 0:20:21,24
platters,... irony and self-deprecation.


268
0:20:21,24 --> 0:20:23,92
Sounds a little hard to swallow.


269
0:20:23,92 --> 0:20:25,72
There's... there's pudding.


270
0:20:25,72 --> 0:20:29,48
Pud-ding ! I always loved your quirkiness.


271
0:20:29,48 --> 0:20:32,56
You must be able to see I've moved on.


272
0:20:32,56 --> 0:20:35,8
The projects I've been working on
with Hoover


273
0:20:35,8 --> 0:20:38,0
are the most incisive and effective
I've ever done.


274
0:20:38,0 --> 0:20:42,0
I can't believe some of the shit
I used to do with you.


275
0:20:42,0 --> 0:20:46,88
That's the difference between you and me,
Brian, I could always see into the distance,


276
0:20:46,88 --> 0:20:52,36
you, it has to be said,
were always a little short-sighted.


277
0:20:52,36 --> 0:20:56,68
Anyway, we're having a postmortem
at the Squid and Mashed Potato.


278
0:20:56,68 --> 0:21:0,96
I suppose you could tag along.


279
0:21:0,96 --> 0:21:7,8
You make your mind up
and maybe I'll see you later.


280
0:21:7,8 --> 0:21:14,64
(Music from Psycho)


281
0:21:14,64 --> 0:21:17,64
Now, come on ! There's no need for us
to be here any longer than necessary.


282
0:21:17,64 --> 0:21:20,48
Let's split up, look for survivors
and get out of here !


283
0:21:20,48 --> 0:21:25,68
I'm writing a novel, poetry, articles,
short stories, children's book.


284
0:21:25,68 --> 0:21:28,72
- Ooh, and I'm doing a skydiving course.
- Look, piss off, will ya ?


285
0:21:28,72 --> 0:21:30,28
- Come on !
- What are you doing ?


286
0:21:30,28 --> 0:21:34,44
- I'm saving us !
- This is Hoover.


287
0:21:34,44 --> 0:21:36,76
Bye.


288
0:21:36,76 --> 0:21:39,2
Bye, then.


289
0:21:39,2 --> 0:21:49,48
I'll see you later.


290
0:21:49,48 --> 0:21:53,16
- So beautiful.
- Yeah.


291
0:21:53,16 --> 0:21:57,6
Like a... kind of visual poetry.


292
0:21:57,6 --> 0:22:1,12
- Wish I could do that.
- Well, I'm sure you could if you had funding.


293
0:22:1,12 --> 0:22:4,44
Right hook... bang.


294
0:22:4,44 --> 0:22:7,48
- What ?
- I should have done it long ago, Daisy ?


295
0:22:7,48 --> 0:22:12,36
In his drunken, childish way, Tim saved me.


296
0:22:12,36 --> 0:22:17,32
Talk about expression, talk about the truth,


297
0:22:17,32 --> 0:22:23,92
but what truer expression is there
than the purity of the clenched fist ?


298
0:22:23,92 --> 0:22:27,24
I am a man, Daisy.


299
0:22:27,24 --> 0:22:29,32
A man !


300
0:22:29,32 --> 0:22:32,16
<i>Vulva treated me like a monkey !</i>


301
0:22:32,16 --> 0:22:35,36
I'm more than that, I am a man !


302
0:22:35,36 --> 0:22:37,64
A monkey-man !


303
0:22:37,64 --> 0:22:41,84
A beast with a mind, and a mind, and fists !


304
0:22:41,84 --> 0:22:48,92
And I will not be subdued again,
not by Vulva, not by anyone !


305
0:22:48,92 --> 0:23:3,72
Hey, fella !


306
0:23:3,72 --> 0:23:6,56
Morning, slugger. Any letters ?


307
0:23:6,56 --> 0:23:8,92
I don't know.


308
0:23:8,92 --> 0:23:13,88
Agh !


309
0:23:13,88 --> 0:23:16,32
- How do you feel ?
- Oh, like I'm gonna die.


310
0:23:16,32 --> 0:23:19,64
- Oh, me too.
- So what happened last night ?


311
0:23:19,64 --> 0:23:23,16
We went to see
an interesting piece of contemporary theatre,


312
0:23:23,16 --> 0:23:27,32
<i>we drank an enormous amount of free wine,
we ate our body weight in Twiglets</i>


313
0:23:27,32 --> 0:23:29,88
and you punched an artist in the face.


314
0:23:29,88 --> 0:23:31,72
Shit.


315
0:23:31,72 --> 0:23:33,96
- I'm not supposed to eat Twiglets.
- Why not ?


316
0:23:33,96 --> 0:23:38,36
They make me violent.


317
0:23:38,36 --> 0:23:40,4
It's from the magazine.


318
0:23:40,4 --> 0:23:44,28
Maybe they did like me.
Maybe they liked my kookiness.


319
0:23:44,28 --> 0:23:46,52
I could be like the cute one in the office,
you know ?


320
0:23:46,52 --> 0:23:49,6
The ditzy one who always gets it wrong,
the office clown.


321
0:23:49,6 --> 0:23:52,8
I'd be like "Ooh, Yolanda, I've lost the file."


322
0:23:52,8 --> 0:23:55,28
She'd say "That's all right, Daisy,
we just like having you around,


323
0:23:55,28 --> 0:24:0,4
cos you're crazy and wild,
an asset to the office dynamic."


324
0:24:0,4 --> 0:24:2,68
- It's a no.
- Oh, well, never mind.


325
0:24:2,68 --> 0:24:6,96
Who needs them anyway, Daisy ?
What do they know ? They're just jealous.


326
0:24:6,96 --> 0:24:10,32
- Of what ?
- Your tits ?


327
0:24:10,32 --> 0:24:14,0
It's not about my tits any more, Tim.
I wish it were.


328
0:24:14,0 --> 0:24:15,48
It's not like the old days


329
0:24:15,48 --> 0:24:18,72
when you could get a job wearing a short skirt
and showing a bit of cleavage.


330
0:24:18,72 --> 0:24:21,12
I've got to prove my intellectual worth.


331
0:24:21,12 --> 0:24:24,96
I know there's something I've got to be,
I just don't know what it is.


332
0:24:24,96 --> 0:24:28,8
I feel like a rabbit...


333
0:24:28,8 --> 0:24:30,12
trapped on a road to nowhere,


334
0:24:30,12 --> 0:24:33,52
frozen in the headlights of the 21 st century.


335
0:24:33,52 --> 0:24:38,0
Daisy, for the last time,
will you stop being so dramatic ?


336
0:24:38,0 --> 0:24:40,64
Why do you have to make
such a performance out of everything ?


337
0:24:40,64 --> 0:24:43,72
Yeah !


338
0:24:43,72 --> 0:24:48,28
Rabbit, rabbit, rabbit, rabbit...


339
0:24:48,28 --> 0:24:54,24
Rabbit, rabbit, rabbit, rabbit, rabbit,
rabbit, rabbit, rabbit, rabbit, rabbit !


340
0:24:54,24 --> 0:24:59,56
Ooh, like a little flower !


341
0:24:59,56 --> 0:25:10,4
Thank you for coming, it's been very useful !


342
0:25:10,4 --> 0:25:17,72
It's been very useful !


343
0:25:17,72 --> 0:25:20,56
Rabbit, rabbit, rabbit, rabbit, rabbit !


344
0:25:20,56 --> 0:25:22,68
Rabbit, rabbit, rabbit, rabbit !


345
0:25:22,68 --> 0:25:25,24
It's not as easy as it looks, is it ?


346
0:25:25,24 --> 0:27:25,24
Rabbit, rabbit, rabbit, rabbit, rabbit...
