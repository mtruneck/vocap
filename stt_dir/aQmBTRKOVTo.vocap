###1 PAUL LEE: My name is Paul Lee.
###2 And I'm a product manager here at Google.
###4 For the past several years, my wife and I
###6 have had the pleasure of volunteering
###8 with the International Justice Mission.
###10 And today, I am privileged to introduce
###12 its founder and CEO Gary Haugen.
###15 So who is Gary Haugen?
###18 I didn't fact check this.
###19 So we'll go with this.
###21 This is what the internet says Gary is.
###24 Gary is the youngest of six kids and hails
###26 from nearby Sacramento.
###28 During elementary school, he decided
###29 he want to be a lawyer, inspired by the examples of Lincoln
###32 and MLK.
###33 He played football in high school,
###36 with the scene crew cut he generously
###37 shares with us today.
###39 And in 1981, he departed for the lesser school
###42 in the East Coast, Harvard.
###44 After graduating in 1985, Gary traveled to South Africa
###48 during the apartheid era, and worked
###49 with Michael Cassidy and Desmond Tutu
###51 at the National Initiative for Reconciliation.
###55 For those of you who were born in the '80s,
###57 this was during the apartheid era.
###59 And as an example of what it was like in that period,
###61 in one instance Gary was detained by security forces
###65 for attending a multiracial church
###66 service without permission.
###68 This was a world at that time.
###71 In 1988, Gary started law school at the University of Chicago.
###74 And during that time, he worked for the Lawyers Committee
###76 on Human Rights.
###77 He investigated crimes like Lupeau Massacre of 1987,
###80 which involved the execution of 17 civilians
###83 by soldiers in the Filipino army.
###85 After law school, Gary joined the Department of Justice
###87 as a trial attorney in the Civil Rights Division.
###90 Gary met his wife, Jan, during this time.
###92 They now have four kids.
###93 And in 1994, Gary was detailed to the UN Center
###96 for Human Rights, where he directed the UN's investigation
###100 of the genocide in Rwanda.
###102 I actually have on my computer, but didn't
###104 send it to Ruthie in time, a photo, my favorite photo
###107 that I've seen in the IJM office.
###109 It's a picture of a giant military camouflage
###113 helicopter in the background, Gary
###117 dressed pretty much like he is right now,
###119 and scores of kids running towards him.
###122 And I asked the staff there, what
###124 is that photo, because it's just kick
###125 butt to see this giant military transport and all
###129 these kids and Gary.
###130 It turns out that it was from 2006, his first trip
###133 back to Rwanda where he visited a remote area that
###137 was part of his investigation.
###139 That time was pivotal, and if we go back to 1994,
###144 Gary, when he worked for the investigation,
###146 collected with his team, testimony of physical evidence
###150 from 100 mass graves and massacre
###152 sites across the country.
###154 Allow me to share because I can't do this justice, the "New
###156 Yorker" subscription as experienced from an article
###158 they wrote about this in 2009.
###161 "Gary was sickened to come across charred piles of bodies
###164 in a church where Tutsi had expected to find sanctuary.
###167 He took down the testimony of a father
###169 who saw his three small children hacked to death with machetes.
###172 At one massacre site, Haugen rolled back
###174 the decaying body of a woman, and found
###177 the corpse of her child beneath her."
###179 End quote.
###180 Over the next 17 years-- sorry, let me back up.
###185 Moved by this experience, Gary returned to the US
###188 and went into start-up planning mode.
###191 He would build a new organization
###192 that would not simply plead for victims,
###194 but would actually rescue them.
###196 This organization would focus on four key areas.
###199 Victim relief, perpetrator accountability, aftercare
###203 and structural reform.
###205 In 1997, one year prior to Google's own start,
###208 Gary found IJM with one employee, desks
###211 for two interns in an office park.
###214 Over the next 17 years, IJM would establish operations
###217 in 10 countries and earn the right
###219 to investigate and prosecute crimes,
###221 working with local law enforcement
###223 and public prosecutors.
###224 You won't see these videos, but I've seen them.
###227 And what you'll see if you were actually at IJM headquarters
###231 is pictures of staff putting their lives
###232 on the line in the back of SWAT vans, raiding brothels,
###237 chasing out the aggressors and rescuing the victims.
###240 It's a pretty powerful experience.
###242 The organization now includes 600 staff,
###245 including an investigations team led
###246 by Mark Clookie, the former director of NCIS-- yes, he
###250 did do two cameos on a TV show-- a policy team led by Holly
###254 Burkhalter, former advocacy director for Human Rights
###257 Watch, as well as 200 lawyers.
###261 Today IJM is a $50 million human rights agency
###264 that, in the words of the "Atlantic"'s Stephen Bradley,
###267 investigates and prosecutes the worst crimes, the worst evils,
###272 around the globe.
###274 Human trafficking, sexual exploitation, slavery,
###277 police brutality, violence in all manifestation
###281 but principally violence against the world's poor.
###285 Over the last years, I've served on the board.
###287 I've worked in my career with over 40 non-profits.
###290 And some of these non-profits are amazing.
###291 I think they do incredible work.
###293 This is the first time I worked with a nonprofit that
###295 has as its dashboard monitoring loss of life and limb
###299 to staff, tracking assassination attempts on their staff workers
###303 in the field.
###304 The work they do is really incredible.
###306 In 2013 alone, IJM rescued over 2,000 victims
###310 and secured over 100 convictions.
###313 That's in one year.
###314 Over the past 18 years, IJM has rescued over 18,000 victims,
###319 trained 13,000 officers and officials
###322 and secured over 700 convictions, much of them
###324 in the past five years alone.
###326 However, more significant than these
###328 numbers is growing evidence that IJM's model is beginning
###331 to result in structural transformation and hopefully
###334 permanent change.
###335 A Gates Foundation-funded study, for instance,
###338 found that the number of minors available for exploitation
###340 in metro Ceba in the Philippines plummeted 79% over four years.
###346 As a result of the investigation's work in 2012,
###349 Gary received the Trafficking In Persons Report Hero Reward.
###352 IJM was also one of 11 organizations that
###355 received a combined $11 million grant from Google.org in 2011.
###359 A significant portion of that grant
###362 was allocated to syndicate IJM's model
###365 to other nonprofits in India.
###366 And in the first nine months of 2013 alone,
###369 that initiative and your money, Google's money,
###372 resulted in 830 victim rescues.
###376 Earlier this month, Oxford University Press
###378 released Gary's latest book "The Locust Effect:
###381 Why the End of Poverty Requires the End of Violence,"
###383 written with Victor Boutros, who's here in the front
###385 as well, federal prosecutor.
###387 Let me just say, amongst the many endorsements
###389 that came from Bill Clinton, Anne Marie Slaughter,
###391 Madeleine Albright, I think my favorite
###393 is from Madeleine Albright that says "the book is
###395 a much-needed argument for reducing violence
###398 against the poor, and a demonstration
###399 through firsthand stories that are
###401 both shocking and true of why that goal is so vital.
###404 The book is both a vehicle for sharing voices rarely heard
###407 and a declaration of faith that with sufficient will,
###411 there are ways to halt the physical and financial
###414 exploitation of the disadvantaged.
###417 By reminding us that basic legal protections are not
###419 a privilege but a universal right,
###421 Gary Haugen has issued a moral call
###423 to arms that informs the brain and touches the heart."
###426 That's my hope for us today, that we'll keep our brains
###429 and our hearts open as we welcome Gary to Google.
###432 Please join me.
###434 [APPLAUSE]
###440 
###443 GARY HAUGEN: Thanks, Paul, very much
###444 for the extravagant introduction.
###446 I appreciate that you got all the material from my mom,
###449 and you did a great, great job with it.
###451 Thanks very much.
###453 And Kevin, thanks for dragging all your friends here.
###457 He told me this is the smartest people at Google.
###460 So congratulations for that.
###461 Or the people who couldn't afford to buy a book,
###463 so the first 10 who showed up got a book.
###465 So way to go.
###469 I'm glad you mentioned the hair.
###471 I did a Google Hangout in New York,
###474 with your colleagues in New York.
###476 And Justin introduced me.
###477 That pretty much was the entire introduction
###479 was just making fun of my hair.
###481 So this was really cool in the '50s.
###484 It really, really was.
###486 Anyways, it's marvelous to get to be with you.
###489 Thank you for the Google grant, that
###493 allowed us to replicate the work in India.
###496 Thousands of people now have been
###497 rescued as a result of that.
###499 I've been in places of literal slavery
###501 and are now free because of the willingness
###503 to engage in this work and to train others in how to do it.
###506 But I'd like to start this afternoon with a story much,
###509 much closer to home-- actually just a few hours from here
###512 across the California border in Oregon, in a rural county where
###517 there was a woman, not too long ago,
###519 who was home alone at night.
###521 It's dark out.
###523 And she starts to hear an intruder begin
###526 to break open her side door.
###529 And she looks over, and sees this man
###533 breaking his way into her house.
###535 It's terrifying, especially for her,
###537 because two weeks before, this same man in her community
###540 had put her in the hospital through an assault.
###543 And now he is clawing his way into her house.
###547 So she does what any sort of terrified person
###549 would do in their house in America.
###551 She picks up the phone, and she calls 911.
###555 And what proceeds is a pretty horrific 10 minute conversation
###560 with this 911 operator who proceeds to explain
###563 that due to budget cuts in her rural county,
###567 law enforcement is only operating on the weekdays.
###571 And this is a weekend.
###573 And so she's simply explaining to her
###575 that you don't have law enforcement in your area.
###579 Listen to this for just a moment.
###580 [AUDIO PLAYBACK]
###581 -I don't have anybody to send out there.
###585 Uh, you know, obviously if he comes inside the residence
###589 and assaults you, can you ask him to go away?
###591 Or do you know if he's intoxicated or anything?
###594 -I've already asked him.
###595 I've already told him I was calling you.
###596 He's broken in before, busted down my door, assaulted me.
###599 -Uh huh.
###600 Is there any way you can safely leave the residence?
###604 -No, I can't.
###606 Because he's blocking pretty much my only way out.
###608 -Well, the only thing I can do is give you some advice.
###610 And call the sheriff's office tomorrow,
###613 Obviously, if he comes in and unfortunately, has a weapon
###619 or is trying to cause you physical harm,
###621 that's a different story.
###622 The sheriff's office doesn't work up there.
###624 I don't have anybody to send.
###626 [END AUDIO PLAYBACK]
###628 GARY HAUGEN: The Sheriff's office doesn't work up there.
###631 I don't have anybody to send.
###634 Of course, what happens is that man tears into that place,
###639 assaults her, chokes her, brutally rapes her.
###643 This is what happens if there's no law
###646 enforcement in your area, if there's no one to send for you.
###652 And yet, this book that we've written,
###654 "The Locust Effect," what this is about
###656 is the story that there are about four billion people
###658 in our world who have no access to law enforcement.
###662 Especially for those who are poorest,
###664 a study was done by the UN that says quote-- listen to this--
###668 "most poor people live outside the protection of law."
###674 Now that's a phrase that we can sort of
###676 read and just let wash over us.
###678 But I think there's perhaps nothing quite like this phone
###680 call that allows us for just a moment
###682 to step into the shoes of the common poor person
###685 in the developing world who has no access to law
###688 enforcement and the terror that that represents in their lives.
###692 So that's the big number.
###693 Four billion people do not have access
###696 to law enforcement that will actually
###698 protect them from violence.
###699 But what does that actually look like in the developing world?
###702 Well, it looks like this in Bolivia,
###704 where if you were to sexually assault
###707 a child in Bolivia, statistically,
###709 you would actually be at greater risk of slipping in the shower
###712 and dying than you would have ever
###714 being sent to jail for that crime.
###717 Imagine a state of such impunity-- yes,
###720 it's completely against the law.
###722 But the problem for the poor is not that they don't get laws,
###725 it's they don't get law enforcement.
###727 This means, in India and other places in South Asia,
###732 if you enslave someone, literally enslave someone,
###737 you're at greater risk of being struck by lightning than you
###740 are of ever being sent to jail for the crime of slavery.
###745 This is a profound and massive phenomenon
###750 across the developing world that receives very, very
###753 little mention at all, which is the utter breakdown
###756 of basic criminal justice systems in the developing
###758 world.
###759 And what it has done, then, is unleash this epidemic
###763 of violence against the poor.
###765 And in "The Locust Effect," this is really
###767 what we're trying to bring to the surface.
###769 Because if I say the word global poverty
###771 and if you try to bring sort of images to mind,
###774 what comes to mind?
###775 I mean immediately you start to think,
###776 don't you, about dirty shacks.
###778 You think about the dirty water.
###780 You think of sickness.
###781 You think of kids who can't go to school.
###784 You think of lack of capital, the need for microfinance,
###788 all those sorts of needs.
###789 One of the things that does not commonly come to the surface
###792 for us is the way that to be poor
###795 is to be chronically vulnerable to violence.
###798 But the problem is all that violence
###800 stays below the surface.
###802 Many of us have traveled to the developing world.
###804 And we've seen the dirty shacks, the dirty water, the hunger,
###807 the people who are sick.
###809 But very few of us will ever just visually see the violence.
###812 And so it takes something for us to be traveling
###815 into that subterranean world to see
###818 what that violence looks like.
###819 And this is what we try to do in the opening
###821 chapters of "The Locust Effect" is take you
###824 with a common poor person in the developing world
###826 to see what this violence is like.
###827 And we begin with the first category
###830 of most pervasive violence among the poor in the developing
###833 world.
###834 And that's basically gender violence.
###836 That's sexual violence and domestic abuse
###839 of women and girls.
###841 It is, in the collapse of law enforcement,
###843 open season on women and girls.
###845 In fact, gender violence accounts
###848 for more death and disability for women and girls
###852 between the age of 15 and 44 than malaria, cancer, car
###855 accidents and war combined.
###859 This is why we're calling this epidemic "every day violence,"
###863 because, again, if we are familiar with the violence
###865 against the poor, most of the time
###867 we're thinking about the sort of catastrophic spasms of violence
###870 that are in the headlines.
###872 Like the wars, the conflicts, and for sure,
###874 those do decimate people's lives.
###877 And I know something about that myself, of course,
###879 having been the director of the genocide investigation
###882 in Rwanda where, as Paul mentioned,
###885 I just was given this list by UN military intelligence of 100
###888 different mass graves and massacre sites.
###891 And we just tediously sorted through these thousands
###894 and thousands of people who'd been
###896 butchered by their neighbors.
###899 And when you're doing that work, especially
###901 as an investigator, what you're really trying to do
###903 is recreate visually how did this happen
###906 from the forensic evidence that's there.
###908 And what is it like for that family pressed up
###910 against the wall of that stadium or that school
###914 or that cathedral, as they see those machetes coming
###917 towards them?
###918 And the thing that was so manifest to me
###921 is that, yes, all these Rwandans were overwhelmingly
###923 very, very poor.
###925 The average Rwandan is living off about $0.65 a day.
###929 But in that moment of terror, when the machetes
###932 are coming towards you and your family,
###934 you're actually not crying out for some food.
###937 You're not crying out for a doctor.
###938 You're not crying out for a microloan.
###940 You're not crying out for a teacher in education.
###944 You're crying out for someone to restrain
###945 the hand of that machete.
###948 And this is the thing that makes violence different.
###952 It is a profound affliction of the poor,
###955 but it's different than the other problems that we engage.
###958 And this first category of massive abuse
###961 is gender violence.
###962 But like so many things, it stays below the surface.
###965 At the beginning of the book, I just
###967 invite readers to come with me to meet Lucilla who's
###969 this woman that I met in a small town in the Andean mountains
###973 in Peru.
###974 Very common woman, lives in a town that you would not
###976 necessarily notice or pay any attention to,
###980 except for the fact it has a rate of sexual assault
###984 that is worse than the sexual assault rates that were coming
###987 out of the worst war zones of the Congo.
###990 And if you follow through the story of Lucilla
###992 as she has to endure the rape and murder
###995 of her eight-year-old daughter, who's just dumped out
###998 on the street one night.
###1000 And to follow Lucilla in what it is like for her
###1002 to try to get justice in a totally broken criminal justice
###1006 system.
###1009 Gender violence is this massive epidemic
###1012 against women and girls who are poorest and most vulnerable
###1015 in the world.
###1016 The second massive category of violence against the poor
###1019 is a kind of violence that actually
###1021 keeps people in poverty by force, and that's slavery.
###1025 You may already know that there are about 30 million people
###1028 held in slavery in the world today.
###1032 These are not people held in slave-like conditions
###1034 or metaphorical slavery-- in actual slavery.
###1038 At IJM, we've met thousands of them.
###1040 And thanks to Google's work with us
###1042 have also been able to bring rescue to thousands.
###1045 But there remain actually more people
###1047 in slavery today than in any other time in human history.
###1052 Mind boggling, right?
###1054 It's true that a smaller proportion of human beings
###1057 are in slavery.
###1057 That's true.
###1058 A smaller proportion of the economy
###1060 is produced by slave labor.
###1062 That's true.
###1062 But there's just so many more human beings
###1064 that the absolute number of people in slavery
###1067 is greater now than any other time in history.
###1070 One of the ways we try to bring readers into this again
###1072 subterranean reality is to take people
###1075 to Bangalore, which is sort of the shining high-tech capital
###1079 in India, really sort of the icon of the booming economies
###1083 of India.
###1085 But an Indian lawyer takes me on a drive just a few minutes
###1088 outside the beltway of Bangalore and shows
###1090 me a brick factory where scores of people
###1092 are held literally as slaves working seven days a week,
###1095 12 to 14 hours a day, making and carrying bricks.
###1098 And anybody's who's ever tried to run away
###1100 from the facility is chased down,
###1102 dragged back and beaten in front of the others.
###1104 In fact, when this one couple was able to escape,
###1108 the owner of the brick factory was able to go to their village
###1110 and actually kidnap and hold some family members
###1113 and neighbors as hostages, and just
###1116 publicly proclaim until you bring me back my slaves,
###1119 I'm going to continue to detain and torture their neighbors.
###1124 In other words, he was very happy to let everyone
###1127 know that he was exercising this kind of violence,
###1129 because he had zero fear that he would ever
###1132 be brought to account under the law.
###1135 So I got a chance to sit with Mariamam for instance,
###1138 as she explained what it was like to live
###1141 as a slave with her family and about two dozen
###1144 other over of her neighbors as literal slaves
###1147 in the 21st century.
###1150 So the book takes us again to that subterranean world
###1153 that we would otherwise have no idea about.
###1156 The third sort of catastrophic form
###1158 of violence against the poor, surprisingly perhaps,
###1161 is police abuse.
###1164 It turns out that the World Bank did
###1166 this study called "Voices of the Poor"
###1168 which gave to the tens of thousands of poor people
###1171 just the chance to say what is it about your poverty that's
###1174 most painful to you.
###1176 And the study was very rigorous, and one
###1178 of things it was saying that police
###1184 and courts in the developing world
###1186 actually make poor people poorer and less secure.
###1190 What?
###1191 I mean that's like a finding that
###1193 says the hospitals in the developing world
###1195 are making everybody sicker.
###1196 Or the schools are actually the places
###1198 where everyone's prohibited from reading.
###1201 This is what public justice systems
###1203 have become in the developing world--
###1205 places actually of harm.
###1206 If you're poor, you run away from the police to be safe.
###1208 You don't run to the police to be safe.
###1212 One of the manifestations of this
###1213 is the reality of pretrial detention, where the police are
###1217 able to throw people into jails and hold them
###1220 without any charge or trial.
###1222 In any given year, there's about 10 million people,
###1225 overwhelmingly the poorest, who are held in pretrial detention.
###1228 What you don't see in that statistic though,
###1230 that of the tens of millions of people
###1231 who are attached to those families, when
###1234 the breadwinner is taken into prison,
###1236 the way that devastates the capacity of that family
###1239 to move forward.
###1241 So police abuse is the third and just horrific form
###1245 of violence confronting the poor.
###1247 The fourth, interestingly, is violent land theft.
###1252 Just a way that the poor will have their land stolen
###1255 from them by people of power and violence.
###1257 In any given year, about 5 million people
###1261 will get themselves violently ejected off of their land.
###1265 And if you were to look at, well,
###1266 who's most vulnerable to this, it
###1268 turns out that widows are, especially widows in Africa.
###1271 As the AIDS epidemic has devastated
###1273 much of the male population, it leaves these families, right?
###1277 And what happens is that stronger families will come
###1280 and they'll just throw a widow like Susan and her kids
###1283 off their land.
###1285 One of the things that's amazing that I had no understanding of
###1288 was the idea that widows like Susan in the developing world
###1293 support a half a billion orphans.
###1296 So you imagine a poor person who their sort
###1298 of one asset for moving out of poverty
###1300 is their little plot of land, which gives them
###1302 a little shelter and then also the little garden where they're
###1305 able to raise some food.
###1306 But if you steal that land away, you've
###1309 taken a very most basic means for progress away from them.
###1315 And you've left them in destitution.
###1317 So that's the fourth largest pervasive form
###1320 of violence against the poor is violent land theft.
###1324 
###1328 The things that we want to bring forth from the book
###1331 is not only this sort of subterranean world of violence
###1334 that we might not be aware of-- and why aren't we aware of it?
###1338 It's hard to visualize-- but secondly, there's
###1340 human beings actively hiding it.
###1343 Dirty water does not actively hide itself.
###1346 Nor do shacks nor generally do diseases, but human beings
###1349 when they commit violence, they work hard to hide it.
###1352 And likewise, the survivors and victims
###1354 of abuse also because of fear and shame many times
###1357 are also hiding it as well.
###1359 So the book is trying to bring this back up to the surface.
###1361 But not only that, but help people
###1364 begin to think about what are the implications of this
###1367 for our dreams for the poor, that is,
###1369 that they would be able to get out of poverty.
###1372 And this is why we're calling it "The Locust Effect,"
###1374 because one of the pictures we want people to have
###1377 is just the way that over the millennia,
###1381 these poor farm communities, who are trying
###1383 to scrape their way out of poverty by all this farm work,
###1386 in a single day would see the locusts descend
###1390 and just destroy all of those years
###1393 of hard work in a single day.
###1394 And this is the way predatory violence
###1396 works in the life of the poor.
###1397 In a moment, they descend and destroy that work.
###1402 But not only did it destroy the fruit of the farm work,
###1405 but what's interesting about the locust is
###1407 that farm work doesn't stop the locust.
###1411 So not only does violence destroy
###1413 the fruit of the efforts of the poor
###1415 and the efforts of those who attempt to help them,
###1418 but also the traditional things that we do to assist the poor,
###1422 they don't stop the violence.
###1424 So that suggests that we need to start
###1425 talking about poverty differently
###1428 and start doing things differently about poverty
###1431 as well.
###1432 So then that raises the question that we
###1434 try to address a bit in the book is my goodness,
###1437 why are criminal justice systems so completely useless,
###1441 backwards, brutal and broken in the developing world?
###1444 And there is four pretty interesting surprises
###1447 that explain this.
###1448 One of them, which if you traveled in the developing
###1451 world you probably noticed, but it didn't really
###1455 come to your mind what it was that you are seeing.
###1457 And that is, you probably went to a restaurant and a hotel,
###1460 and you exchanged some money, and you
###1462 went to some other places, novels and almost everywhere
###1464 that you and I would go in the developing world,
###1466 someone will be there with a gun guarding you.
###1471 Because with the collapse of public justice systems
###1474 in the developing world, what's come into its place?
###1477 Well, people with wealth and money and businesses
###1480 have set up a completely parallel system
###1482 of private security.
###1485 So now, in fact, in a country like Guatemala,
###1488 private security forces are seven times larger
###1490 than the public police force.
###1494 In Africa, the largest employer on the continent
###1498 is private security.
###1500 In a way that almost we have not remarked upon at all,
###1503 a massive social transformation has taken place
###1506 in the developing world, where security, instead of it being
###1509 a public good that's provided to everybody
###1512 through public institutions of policing and criminal justice
###1516 system has been privatized.
###1518 So now there's two kinds of people in the developing world.
###1521 Those who can pay for their own security and those who cannot
###1524 afford to pay for security, cannot pay to be safe,
###1527 and so they're not.
###1529 So we now have to picture 2 and 1/2 billion people who live off
###1535 less than $2 a day, who cannot purchase into their own
###1539 security and are living in this lawless chaos.
###1542 What is the impact for them on trying to get out of poverty?
###1547 There's several other explanations
###1548 in the book that are pretty surprising about how
###1551 it is that criminal justice systems and law enforcement has
###1554 become so broken in the developing world.
###1557 But then what we try to do is finally
###1558 sort of pivot towards some hope, because I
###1561 realize I've pretty much decimated your Wednesday
###1564 right here that was going along very well just fine.
###1567 And then we hear about all this massive violence
###1570 and human suffering.
###1571 It's like, thank you very much, Gary.
###1573 I'll take a nap now.
###1576 But we've been at this work now for almost 20 years.
###1580 And you think we'd be pretty much in a fetal position
###1582 somewhere, because of all the sort of overwhelming corruption
###1585 and abuse and violence.
###1587 But actually I have never been and we've never
###1590 been more hopeful about coming to a tipping
###1593 point of transformation in the developing world.
###1596 And why is that?
###1597 Where is the hope come from?
###1598 The first place that hope comes from is history.
###1602 Most of us just have never thought
###1603 for a few minutes of like, where did our own reasonably
###1607 functioning public justice systems come from?
###1610 Our public justice system, our police and courts
###1612 aren't perfect, for sure.
###1613 I spent a career at the Department of Justice
###1616 going after corrupt and brutal cops in the United States.
###1620 And my co-author Victor d does this currently
###1622 and works in the Civil Rights Division
###1624 of the Department of Justice.
###1626 All the sort of abuses that happen anywhere in the world
###1629 can also happen here.
###1631 But we breathe, like the invisible oxygen in the air,
###1637 functioning criminal justice systems that keep us safe.
###1639 So we are outraged, are we not, when it turns out
###1642 that law enforcement can't come to my house right now.
###1645 That seems like a completely intolerable situation.
###1648 Because we have reasonably functioning justice systems.
###1651 But if you lived in the San Francisco Bay
###1653 Area 120 years ago, what kind of law enforcement
###1659 would you be experiencing?
###1660 What I could tell you for sure is
###1662 that it would be either non-existent brutal or corrupt
###1665 or completely captured by whatever
###1667 local political party was in charge.
###1669 In fact, what we do in the book is we
###1671 set forth these various examples, these scenarios,
###1673 and have you try to guess.
###1674 Is this one of the familiar cities that you enjoy and walk
###1679 in currently and a story of what their public justice
###1681 system looked like 140 years ago?
###1684 Or is this a current city in the developing world?
###1687 And the descriptions are indistinguishable, one
###1691 from another.
###1692 In other words, criminal justice systems that work and protect
###1695 people, they don't descend from heaven
###1697 as wonderfully operating.
###1699 They always start out brutal and corrupt.
###1702 And a fight is engaged to make them actually serve everybody,
###1708 so that everybody's protected from violence.
###1710 And this is the history that most of us have just forgotten.
###1713 But what it reminds us is that this is possible actually
###1716 for those who are living in the developing world as well.
###1719 So that's the other way we begin to turn to look for hope too,
###1722 because there actually are some stories
###1724 and examples around the world now
###1726 where some best practices are beginning
###1728 to emerge of how the international community can
###1731 join with local champions in the fight
###1735 for trying to secure justice for the poorest.
###1737 One of the best examples that we share
###1739 in the book is the one that Paul alluded to,
###1741 which was this experiment we did with the Gates Foundation
###1744 in the second largest city of the Philippines
###1747 called Ceba which had a terrible problem with child sex
###1749 trafficking.
###1751 And we were given this grant to look at,
###1753 well, let's see if we can do two things.
###1755 Number one can we stand up local law enforcement, the police
###1759 and the courts so they actually effectively enforce
###1762 the law against child sex trafficking.
###1764 Is that even possible?
###1765 Because maybe it's so hopelessly corrupt and brutal
###1767 that's not even possible.
###1769 And if that does happen, will that actually
###1771 reduce the amount of violence against kids
###1774 in the commercial sex trade?
###1775 Or is this just hopelessly some part
###1777 of a massive problem of poverty that will never
###1779 be affected by good law enforcement.
###1781 Well, outside auditors went in before the project
###1784 began and sort of drew a baseline
###1786 of how much victimization of children
###1788 there was in the commercial sex trade.
###1790 And the goal of the project over a four-year period of time
###1793 was to try to demonstrate a 20% reduction
###1796 in the victimization of these kids.
###1798 That would have hit the ball out of the park, home run.
###1801 Gates Foundation would have been super, super proud
###1803 of this amazing winning project.
###1806 But after four years of standing up local law enforcement
###1809 by deploying, as IJM does everywhere
###1812 in the world, local, indigenous Filipino lawyers,
###1818 criminal investigators and social workers
###1820 to actually turn law enforcement around,
###1823 what we saw after four short years was their auditors
###1826 found a 79% reduction in the victimization of kids
###1831 in the commercial sex trade.
###1833 Why is that?
###1834 Fundamentally, you learn two things.
###1836 Number one crimes against the poor is crime of opportunity.
###1841 You do it, because you can get away with it.
###1843 And it turns out that when you can't get away with it,
###1845 you don't do it anymore.
###1847 It also turns out that people who oppress the poor
###1849 are not brave people.
###1851 And when they start to feel a sense of reasonable risk
###1854 that they could pay a price for that,
###1855 they just leave them alone.
###1857 There are a number of stories in the book that
###1859 begin to show, not only from IJM but from other NGOs
###1864 around the world, other government organizations that
###1866 are beginning to turn this plague of violence around.
###1871 Our invitation to you is just really two-fold.
###1874 One is to help us to change the conversation about poverty.
###1878 / of you have probably been engaged because you even
###1880 came here this afternoon.
###1881 You probably have some heart for the struggle
###1884 against poverty in our world.
###1885 And we are at an inflection point
###1887 in history of making really some tremendous improvements.
###1891 But we're also stalling out in terms
###1893 of trying to help the the 2 and 1/2 billion
###1897 who are living off $2 a day, in them actually breaking through.
###1901 And so what we would want to do is
###1902 begin to make sure that we don't fail
###1906 to include the problem of violence
###1908 when we talk about poverty.
###1911 So I would love it if you got a hold of the book,
###1913 read it, got yourself educated, so you yourself are capable
###1917 advocate of just almost always asking the question.
###1919 Yeah, but what about the violence?
###1921 And how are we dealing with the violence?
###1923 And how are we strengthening local law enforcement
###1925 to be able to address it?
###1927 The second thing we would love for you to do
###1930 is not only get the book, educate yourself, participate
###1933 in the discussion, but right now, there
###1937 is a very, very important conversation going on
###1939 with the United Nations about the Millennium Development
###1942 Goals.
###1942 You might have heard about this.
###1944 In the year 2000, the UN put together
###1947 from the international community a blueprint-- the blueprint--
###1951 for trying to address poverty and to try
###1953 to make massive progress over 15 years.
###1956 So they came up with these eight Millennium Goals.
###1959 Well, in many respects, those have
###1961 been really helpful and very powerful.
###1963 But one of the grand mistakes that was made
###1966 was that they drew up a blueprint to address poverty
###1970 and didn't say a word about violence, this horrific force
###1974 that undercuts so much of what's being
###1976 done to try to assist the poor.
###1978 An example of that, for instance,
###1980 is girls' education in the developing world, which
###1982 is this amazingly powerful way to actually bring prosperity
###1988 to a whole community, not only for the individual girls
###1990 but for that whole community.
###1992 The problem is now studies show that one
###1994 of the primary reasons girls don't
###1995 go to school in the developing world is because of violence.
###1999 Violence on the way to school, violence
###2001 in school, violence in the home that
###2002 keeps them from going to school.
###2004 And so we want to make sure that as the UN now
###2007 is rewriting the Millennium Development Goals, so
###2011 that in the year 2015, they'll launch
###2014 this new blueprint for addressing poverty,
###2016 we just simply want to make sure,
###2018 let's not leave out violence.
###2020 It's a bit like the AIDS epidemic
###2022 when it began to really roll through the developing
###2025 world in the '90s.
###2026 And millions of people were being decimated.
###2030 Really you could not be serious about addressing poverty
###2036 in the developing world if you are not
###2037 willing to confront the problem of AIDS,
###2039 because whatever it is that you are doing,
###2041 AIDS is going to show up and impact it.
###2043 In the same way, we are hoping to engage the conversation
###2046 about poverty in the developing world to say,
###2049 unless you're dealing with the problem of violence
###2051 and the lawlessness unleashed by the collapse
###2053 of criminal justice system, it's going
###2055 to roll over almost everything else you're trying to do.
###2058 And so we would love it if you would go
###2062 to the locusteffect.com/petition,
###2066 and just joined a petition there.
###2068 That goes to the Secretary General of the UN.
###2071 It ought to just be millions of common people
###2074 who say, as they did with regard to the AIDS epidemic, hey,
###2076 I'm not an expert about everything,
###2078 but I care about this stuff.
###2079 And it seems to make sense to me that if we don't address
###2081 violence, we're not going to make the progress that we
###2084 want in addressing poverty.
###2085 Simple as that.
###2086 But what I can tell you is that this stuff matters.
###2090 And it's a tremendous way for you
###2092 not only to engage yourself, but begin
###2094 to mobilize all of your networks into the fight.
###2097 So that's all I have to share this afternoon.
###2100 I'd be happy to take questions or interaction.
###2103 AUDIENCE: In your first example, the local police station
###2107 had lost funding.
###2109 So my question to you would be in these developing world,
###2112 where the governments themselves often
###2114 lack funding, if you have any ideas for
###2118 had to attack that angle.
###2119 GARY HAUGEN: Yeah.
###2120 In many respects, we'll look in the developing world
###2123 and we'll see, especially in low income countries,
###2126 you think, wow, they really don't have enough resources
###2128 in the country to actually provide
###2130 for decent law enforcement.
###2131 Except when you look at all the dollars
###2133 that are being spent on private security.
###2135 And then you realize, oh, in the aggregate,
###2137 this economy actually has plenty of money
###2139 to be able to provide for public security, public law and order.
###2144 And so what it takes is a groundswell
###2148 of social demand within these communities--
###2155 a groundswell of demand to actually reallocate
###2158 resources to the priority of providing for law enforcement.
###2163 That's why I want to emphasize this is not
###2165 a problem is going to be solved from outsiders paratrooping
###2169 in and setting up American justice systems
###2172 or something like that.
###2173 This is a fight that the community itself, the nation,
###2177 must own.
###2179 And part of that is to rally the community,
###2183 to begin to demand that the public justice system is well
###2187 provided for.
###2188 So that's one of the things the International Justice
###2190 Mission does.
###2191 And a number of the other examples
###2194 that we given in the book is how do we
###2196 come alongside local champions in those communities
###2199 and help resource them to be able to draw attention
###2202 to the problem, but also realign resources
###2208 so they're providing for a public justice
###2210 system that cares for all.
###2213 One of the amazing, of course, examples of this
###2217 is the country of Georgia, which is a former Soviet republic,
###2221 which in 2003 was ranked something like 145 out of 190
###2227 countries as most corrupt.
###2229 It was ranked as more corrupt than any country that we
###2231 work in, especially the police.
###2234 But there was a demand amongst the citizenry
###2237 and a new election that brought to bear leaders
###2240 into power who began to attack corruption.
###2243 And they started with police corruption.
###2245 And the thing that they found was
###2247 that police officers in Georgia would pay a $10,000 bribe
###2252 in order to get a job, for which they were
###2254 paid by the government $10 a month.
###2257 Why would you do that?
###2259 Because basically you've been given a license
###2261 to then extort money from people.
###2263 And then those high authorities in the Georgian government
###2266 also figured that out.
###2267 Let me see, I get $10,000 bribe.
###2268 We need a lot of police.
###2270 Because the more police we have, the more bribe money I get.
###2273 And so they have this bloated police force
###2276 that was ill trained and ill equipped and completely
###2279 abusive.
###2280 So when this new leadership came in, the first thing they did
###2283 is they fired 16,000 police officers in a single day, sent
###2287 them home and the city was safer.
###2292 Then they rebuilt the police from the ground up.
###2294 And they were able to pay them good wages,
###2298 provide them with good equipment,
###2300 and provide them with good management that
###2302 was able to secure integrity to the police force.
###2305 And the transformation for the common person is tremendous.
###2311 So the resources are there.
###2312 It's just how you allocate them.
###2314 Yeah.
###2315 AUDIENCE: There's a sort of a stereotype about violence
###2318 against the poor, which is maybe part
###2320 of the self-defense mechanism, like you're saying, well,
###2322 after this, we'll feel like going and taking a nap
###2324 and forgetting about the whole thing, which is, oh,
###2326 those poor people over in the poor part of town.
###2328 They have all this violence in their community.
###2330 They're all beating each other up.
###2332 But as long as they don't come into my neighborhood
###2334 and break into my house, I just don't have to think about it.
###2337 I'm wondering especially, it seems
###2339 like this might differ across the different categories
###2341 of violence you were talking about,
###2343 but to what extent are we looking at lawlessness
###2347 within the poor community, and to what extent are we really
###2349 looking at the people who are much better off going
###2352 in systematically taking the land, as you were saying,
###2355 from the poor and enslaving the poor and so
###2357 forth, as opposed to domestic violence, which might be more
###2360 of a poor-on-poor or kind of thing.
###2362 GARY HAUGEN: Yeah.
###2363 It's both.
###2365 Poor-on-poor violence is sort of  relatively-poor-against-the-poorest
###2373 violence.
###2373 Right?
###2374 So the opening story, for instance,
###2376 of the rape and murder of the child in Bolivia in this town,
###2384 that was committed by the wealthy family
###2387 inside the town, who are not wealthy from our perspective.
###2394 But in that town, they are the wealthy or powerful ones.
###2396 So it is sort of the strong preying upon the weak.
###2400 But it is also true that, for instance, the people who
###2403 run slave operations in rice factories, brick factories,
###2408 these are people of substantial economic power
###2411 and substantial political power.
###2414 So those kinds of crimes and especially
###2416 the land theft, those are also crimes
###2418 that have substantial economic power behind them,
###2421 so you are dealing with people who are actually making money
###2424 off the violence.
###2425 There's not a lot of people making money off malaria.
###2428 There's not a lot of people making money off
###2430 of contaminating water or making hospitals run badly.
###2435 You could make up an instance, I guess,
###2437 in which that's the case.
###2438 But for the most part, that's not the case.
###2439 But there is a massive business of economic advantage
###2443 from violence against other human beings.
###2445 And if you don't have a good system that's
###2446 prepared to fight that, that's going
###2448 to roll all over the most vulnerable.
###2452 AUDIENCE: Two kind of related questions.
###2453 Or it might just be that I'm trying to jam two in.
###2456 One, you made a good case for how violence affects the poor.
###2461 I'm curious about flipping that around and thinking
###2464 about how does poverty actually create violence.
###2467 How much of this is from people being poor and having
###2471 no other opportunities?
###2472 How much does that impact the police situation
###2475 where you talk about police who are very underpaid?
###2479 And getting this into the equation,
###2481 the second part of the question is
###2482 where is the most leverage to this.
###2485 There were some big numbers thrown out
###2488 around 4 billion people without law enforcement protection,
###2491 30 million in slavery, where do we
###2493 get the most leverage to actually
###2494 have the most impact on a problem like this?
###2498 GARY HAUGEN: From our perspective,
###2499 there's no question that the biggest leverage comes
###2502 from a credible criminal deterrent in the community.
###2505 Because crime proceeds along elasticity to risk.
###2512 And different kinds of crime is sensitive to risk
###2515 in different ways.
###2516 So if you have social pathology, sort of deviancy,
###2519 that the pedophilia's sort of a crime, where somebody,
###2523 just out of deviancy, is going to commit that crime.
###2525 And actually, it's not very responsive to risk.
###2527 You can ratchet up the law enforcement on that,
###2530 and those people commit those crimes anyways.
###2532 And they end up going to jail.
###2534 So it's not very responsive to risk.
###2537 Also true with crime of necessity,
###2540 where some one feels like, I gotta commit this crime.
###2543 And., that's what a lot of state crime
###2545 is that's committed by governments.
###2546 They think I have to torture this guy in order
###2548 to stay in power.
###2549 So this is a crime of necessarity.
###2551 So that responsiveness to risk is also not that great.
###2555 I also crime of desperation where
###2558 you feel like I got a steal the bread,
###2561 I have to hijack the car because my family's starving,
###2564 and so this is necessity.
###2565 That's also not very responsive to risk.
###2569 But the vast, vast, vast majority
###2571 of crime against the poor is crime of opportunity.
###2574 You do it because you can get away with it.
###2577 And what you find there on the curve
###2579 is that as soon as there is a little increase
###2581 in the risk, that falls very, very sharply,
###2584 especially things like any kind of crime of opportunity
###2589 that produces an economic reward.
###2590 That's certainly like slavery.
###2592 That step drops off like 79% in a four-year period of time
###2596 when people who were doing it just
###2597 for the purposes of making money find that the risk calculation
###2601 has changed so we have seen the greatest returns from just
###2606 making sure that those who would be drawn
###2608 to that crime against the poor feel like they have
###2610 a reasonable chance of going to jail.
###2612 That means you get rid of all the soft crime.
###2616 That will leave you with a hard crime, which
###2619 is the crime of desperation, the crime of necessity,
###2621 the crime of social deviancy.
###2623 And in the West, that's what we're
###2625 trying to mostly battle in our communities.
###2628 But we have a really different struggle
###2632 in the developing world, where there's
###2634 a tremendous amount of soft crime, crime of opportunity
###2636 that hasn't been addressed at all.
###2638 And we will have to eventually get to the other stuff.
###2640 But right now, the massive numbers
###2643 are coming from just pure opportunity.
###2646 Yeah.
###2646 The second question was about-- the prior question--
###2652 AUDIENCE: The first was, I think, what you mentioned,
###2654 which is the crimes of necessity or desperation,
###2657 that how much does poverty itself create
###2659 the violence versus violence exacerbating the poverty?
###2662 GARY HAUGEN: A cycle.
###2663 They're interrelated.
###2664 
###2667 But it's a mistake to imagine that you
###2669 have to wait to solve poverty before you can drastically
###2673 reduce the amount of violence against the poor.
###2676 You can addressed violence because it's
###2680 driven by the incentives of the perpetrator, substantially.
###2683 And so those risk calculations are very, very powerful.
###2687 You will need to address the other sort of caught
###2690 complicated social causes for crime.
###2693 But a massive amount of it can be
###2696 addressed by addressing the incentives of the perpetrators
###2699 unlike dirty water or disease they
###2701 don't have human will behind it.
###2703 All crime does.
###2705 And so you affect the incentives of the perpetrators
###2709 quite powerful and faster than you might otherwise think.
###2711 AUDIENCE: I realize you're focusing on the developing
###2714 world.
###2715 And you just mentioned that, say,
###2718 in a society like ours in the United States,
###2720 we deal with maybe, you say less of this soft crime.
###2725 More the hard crime.
###2726 I feel like we have the same thing happening in the United
###2729 States where money pays for protection.
###2731 For instance, our property taxes pay
###2733 for a safe neighborhood and the poor neighborhoods
###2738 may not get lights.
###2740 Whoever's causing the crime, whether it's
###2743 for economic opportunity by the more, more powerful or out
###2745 of desperation, the same people are
###2747 suffering with the people in those communities.
###2749 Or why do people feel they don't trust law enforcement states?
###2753 Or you could pay for a good representation in court.
###2756 Or you can get a state appointed one
###2758 that only gives your case five seconds.
###2760 So I don't see that those problems don't
###2763 exist in the quote "nondeveloping world."
###2768 Have you given or are there others
###2769 doing similar lines of research?
###2773 GARY HAUGEN: Yeah, and that is the case
###2776 and as I said the first half of my career
###2779 was addressing those failures actually
###2781 here in the United States.
###2782 So there's no abuse taking place overseas that I haven't
###2784 seen somewhere here in the United States.
###2787 What we do have is just massively greater resources
###2790 to address them.
###2791 But it's also true that those with wealth and money
###2793 supplement the provision of public service
###2796 with private security and with private legal representation
###2799 and so forth.
###2800 And so it is certainly true that you
###2802 get better security the wealthier
###2804 you are in the United States and in any country.
###2807 That's true, but the question is whether or not
###2809 you're going to have any sort of even reasonable baseline
###2811 of protection for those reports.
###2813 You might look at Katherine Boo's recent book on, I think,
###2820 "Behind the Beautiful Forevers," where she lived for three years
###2823 in a slum in India.
###2825 And she's this amazing journalist
###2826 who's actually written a lot about the failures of law
###2828 enforcement in the United States too.
###2830 But she wrote about just the realities of poverty
###2833 in the slum, and one of the things, when she came home
###2836 and she was on NPR, talking-- She says well, one thing I can
###2839 say is different about coming home to the United States
###2842 is that the basic level of opportunity for law enforcement
###2846 to provide basic order in the community
###2849 is order of magnitude different.
###2856 It's also true for instance that the poor-- and we have
###2860 mass incarceration of the poor in the United States,
###2862 because of poor legal services in many respects--
###2866 but what's true in the developing
###2868 world is that if you're too poor to have an attorney,
###2872 you get no attorney.
###2874 So you don't get a sleepy attorney or a drunk attorney,
###2877 or you get none at all, and it's ap overwhelmingly likely
###2881 that if you're a poor person in the developing world,
###2884 you will appear in court in a proceeding that is conducted
###2887 in a language you do not understand.
###2889 So you will appear, because actually conducted
###2892 in the colonial language, whether that's
###2894 English or Spanish or French.
###2897 Because the legal institutions were set up
###2898 by the colonial powers, and they have never been re-engineered.
###2901 This is the other amazing thing.
###2903 The laws have changed?
###2905 Post-colonial wonderful embedding
###2907 of human rights standards in domestic law.
###2912 But the pipeline that actually delivers those rights
###2914 is law enforcement, which has been set up by a colonial model
###2918 and never changed.
###2920 And so one of the things that manifests
###2924 is that you don't have any representation at all.
###2928 And you do it in a proceeding that's
###2930 conducted in a language you don't understand.
###2933 So imagine, you're accused of a crime.
###2936 You are thrown into a proceeding in which you
###2938 have no legal protection.
###2940 And you can't understand a word.
###2942 And then you just get shuffled off to jail.
###2944 And you're sort of asking, as I see
###2946 this many times, the defendant who's poor,
###2949 asking the guard, of course, who has no education,
###2952 is illiterate generally, but to ask the guard,
###2954 can you just please explain what just happened?
###2957 So ever society needs to carry vigilance
###2961 on behalf of those who are poorest and most vulnerable,
###2963 who are going to get run over by a criminal justice system,
###2967 But the utter collapse of these systems in the developing world
###2970 is something, as we wrote in another article,
###2974 you almost have to see to believe.
###2975 And we're hoping to just bring that to the surface.
###2978 AUDIENCE: Hi.
###2978 I was just curious if you had any thoughts on any ways
###2982 that information technology has impacted this problem at all.
###2986 Have you seen this through your work?
###2988 Are there things that we could be doing?
###2989 You know, a big place like Google-- that could help.
###2993 GARY HAUGEN: Massively so.
###2994 And in fact, we have had some opportunities
###2998 to bring out our director of investigations,
###3001 for example, who was formerly the director of NCIS
###3004 to talk about the amazing ways that actually technology can be
###3007 leveraged in on behalf of the poor
###3009 to fight much of this crime.
###3011 In many ways in the developing world,
###3013 these technological advances are leapfrogging
###3016 in ways that are able to empower the poor tremendously.
###3019 When I started doing this work, there-- I know,
###3023 it's dating me a bit, but there were no cell phones
###3025 in the developing world.
###3026 And now we give cell phones to slaves inside brick factories.
###3030 And they are able to communicate with us.
###3033 And then there's using imagery to find
###3037 places that are more likely to be using slave labor,
###3042 the way of creating sort of hot spots
###3044 where abuse is taking through data.
###3048 The truth is though every word I just
###3050 used I was acting like I knew what I was talking about.
###3052 [LAUGHTER]
###3053 GARY HAUGEN: You guys are more likely to be the ones
###3056 to actually get to know the needs,
###3058 and then to begin to dream and imagine what technology can do.
###3061 So that would be another wonderful thing for you guys
###3064 to read the book, acquaint yourself with the problems,
###3066 and then begin to imagine with us the way in which technology
###3069 can be leveraged.
###3070 Because one of just absolute things that technology
###3073 is able to do is to bring transparency to what's
###3077 happening by empowering people to signal what is happening
###3080 or communicate what's happening and to shrink the world
###3083 and to do it to do it real time.
###3085 I think technology is fundamentally just going
###3087 to make it harder and harder and harder
###3089 to get away with these things.
###3090 And that is what the victims of abuse and violence
###3093 need most is for other people to know about it.
###3096 Because if you think about it, what does a violent criminal
###3099 always do?
###3099 And its part of the thing that makes them so scary
###3102 is they hide what they do in the dark.
###3105 And they try to intimidate other people from seeing it.
###3108 Why do they do that?
###3110 They do it because they're afraid.
###3112 Criminals are fundamentally afraid,
###3114 that if other people know what's going on,
###3116 they won't be able to withstand the power that we
###3118 brought to bear upon the theme.
###3120 So that way the technology can bring us much more to actually
###3124 be transparent about what's going on in the world
###3126 and empower even the weakest to be able to do that.
###3129 I think we're going to be living in a very different and safer
###3131 world for the poor.
###3132 PAUL LEE: Just join me in giving Gary a hand.
###3134 Thanks for coming over, appreciate it.
