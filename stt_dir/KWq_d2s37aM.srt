0:0:9,829 --> 0:0:12,469
technically turned an apocalypse


4
0:0:12,469 --> 0:0:16,119
there's disaster assistance plasmids
apocalypse is already


5
0:0:16,119 --> 0:0:18,189
all away at the time


6
0:0:18,189 --> 0:0:22,3
all governmental structures are
shattered all societal structures of

0:0:28,29 --> 0:0:30,569
but his superstition for sc


9
0:0:30,569 --> 0:0:33,5
there is still a plan in place


10
0:0:33,5 --> 0:0:36,3
there are some who keep their heads


11
0:0:36,3 --> 0:0:39,41
their fight for


12
0:0:39,41 --> 0:0:42,7
and they have one of the and they
haven't


13
0:0:42,7 --> 0:0:44,91
survival


14
0:0:44,91 --> 0:0:48,13
this will be humanity's last hope


15
0:0:48,13 --> 0:0:49,97
it's only hope


16
0:0:49,97 --> 0:0:51,1
on our planet


17
0:0:51,1 --> 0:0:52,73
now controlled

0:1:7,2 --> 0:1:11,58
detailee an invasion is complete


21
0:1:11,58 --> 0:1:15,89
the invaders controlled the skies


22
0:1:15,89 --> 0:1:19,16
and the ground


23
0:1:19,16 --> 0:1:25,1
with infrastructure destroyed human
survivors are going to be desperate


24
0:1:25,1 --> 0:1:27,19
and without a plan in place


25
0:1:27,19 --> 0:1:29,15
they will be on prepared


26
0:1:29,15 --> 0:1:32,26
panicked


27
0:1:32,26 --> 0:1:34,17
i can't guarantee it most people


28
0:1:34,17 --> 0:1:37,69
are not wear face emergency because we
were like too much on


29
0:1:37,69 --> 0:1:40,28
arty t_m_ cards to get


30
0:1:40,28 --> 0:1:46,13
we rely on getting figures his store to
get food


31
0:1:46,13 --> 0:1:48,67
nothing would be left on the shelves at
your stores


32
0:1:48,67 --> 0:1:54,88
within three hours up any bench


33
0:1:54,88 --> 0:1:59,39
as much as the water and food because
it's everything


34
0:1:59,39 --> 0:2:4,88
demand desperation to stock up on
supplies mobs looted rioted and


35
0:2:4,88 --> 0:2:6,25
destroyed


36
0:2:6,25 --> 0:2:8,899
distribution fighters don't kill you


37
0:2:8,899 --> 0:2:13,149
other humans might uh...


38
0:2:13,149 --> 0:2:18,509
doesn't matter if you're in new york
city in l_a_ or appearing when i was


39
0:2:18,509 --> 0:2:23,419
human nature shimla nature people are
going to fight over resources


40
0:2:23,419 --> 0:2:27,619
now staying alive mainstream only from
stores


41
0:2:27,619 --> 0:2:30,119
and the problem


42
0:2:30,119 --> 0:2:36,549
terrified massive swarm out of the
c_d_c_ search of safety


43
0:2:36,549 --> 0:2:41,49
in at the nighttime what where did you
see really determines that


44
0:2:41,49 --> 0:2:44,669
all the big cities where there are
bright lights


45
0:2:44,669 --> 0:2:47,719
to where to hide is the dark spots


46
0:2:47,719 --> 0:2:48,979
the amazon


47
0:2:48,979 --> 0:2:53,479
and the outback those are the places too
hot


48
0:2:53,479 --> 0:2:56,939
broadway scoring twelve halt


49
0:2:56,939 --> 0:3:1,689
getting out safely by car may be
impossible


50
0:3:1,689 --> 0:3:3,719
listening bumper-to-bumper traffic


51
0:3:3,719 --> 0:3:6,9
combustor freaking out they're gonna and
then in the car to a care in a broken


52
0:3:6,9 --> 0:3:10,299
certainly not a character wasn't


53
0:3:10,299 --> 0:3:13,119
it's happened before


54
0:3:13,119 --> 0:3:19,79
in two thousand five as hurricane rita
approach texas millions fled


55
0:3:19,79 --> 0:3:22,469
the highways around houston instantly
jammed


56
0:3:22,469 --> 0:3:24,599
vehicles ran out of fuel


57
0:3:24,599 --> 0:3:25,81
the entire city


58
0:3:25,81 --> 0:3:27,58
highway system turned into a


59
0:3:27,58 --> 0:3:28,709
parking lot


60
0:3:28,709 --> 0:3:30,499
and it lasted


61
0:3:30,499 --> 0:3:32,549
falls days


62
0:3:32,549 --> 0:3:34,809
reciprocate coming here buddy gap


63
0:3:34,809 --> 0:3:38,309
anyone happens her body runs out house
gives their cards on your statement is


64
0:3:38,309 --> 0:3:39,69
done


65
0:3:39,69 --> 0:3:47,1
because the interstate if structure is a
design for that big of an evacuation


66
0:3:47,1 --> 0:3:52,19
even as the deleon invaders bear down on
humanity


67
0:3:52,19 --> 0:3:56,459
society hasn't learned from past
mistakes


68
0:3:56,459 --> 0:3:58,479
but there are other options


69
0:3:58,479 --> 0:4:2,68
for men and women intent on survival


70
0:4:2,68 --> 0:4:6,299
in general you got a lot of work the
main routes of travel


71
0:4:6,299 --> 0:4:10,849
you know one of where the highways and
the roads in the bridges


72
0:4:10,849 --> 0:4:14,189
cars maybe death traps


73
0:4:14,189 --> 0:4:19,269
a successful getaway demand some other
form of transportation


74
0:4:19,269 --> 0:4:20,479
a plague of course


75
0:4:20,479 --> 0:4:22,69
a motorcycle


76
0:4:22,69 --> 0:4:24,74
if you have a motorcycle you can we get
out of the traffic


77
0:4:24,74 --> 0:4:27,46
maybe that's a lie to yourself having
their


78
0:4:27,46 --> 0:4:28,509
danny


79
0:4:28,509 --> 0:4:31,519
and you go to the water you can get up
skater get out of the city walk raha


80
0:4:31,519 --> 0:4:32,41
everybody's


81
0:4:32,41 --> 0:4:35,98
completely lost


82
0:4:35,98 --> 0:4:36,94
for psalm


83
0:4:36,94 --> 0:4:41,69
safety from alien forces and rampaging
humans


84
0:4:41,69 --> 0:4:43,46
means going underground


85
0:4:43,46 --> 0:4:45,589
literally


86
0:4:45,589 --> 0:4:50,46
subway tunnels cable conduit and even
sewers


87
0:4:50,46 --> 0:4:53,38
won't provide safe thanks


88
0:4:53,38 --> 0:4:56,449
burning cds


89
0:4:56,449 --> 0:5:0,529
bestseller systems great because so few
people ought to go through it


90
0:5:0,529 --> 0:5:4,629
history lesson hits for the ugly but
it's going to be safe


91
0:5:4,629 --> 0:5:6,2
relatively


92
0:5:6,2 --> 0:5:8,259
this is going to be the road less
traveled and that's what you're looking


93
0:5:8,259 --> 0:5:11,629
for


94
0:5:11,629 --> 0:5:12,4
underground


95
0:5:12,4 --> 0:5:16,319
before overweight


96
0:5:16,319 --> 0:5:17,68
by car


97
0:5:17,68 --> 0:5:19,38
by sport


98
0:5:19,38 --> 0:5:20,949
urban dwellers around


99
0:5:20,949 --> 0:5:25,21
planet join amassed exodus out of the
city's


100
0:5:25,21 --> 0:5:26,9
itself


101
0:5:26,9 --> 0:5:32,39
may never risky


102
0:5:32,39 --> 0:5:37,629
the invaders have now destroyed
civilization as we know it


103
0:5:37,629 --> 0:5:39,889
but according to the experts


104
0:5:39,889 --> 0:5:43,709
the destruction of civilization is
predictable


105
0:5:43,709 --> 0:5:51,229
and it's a concert four in the plans to
fight and alien invasion


106
0:5:51,229 --> 0:5:55,49
in the face of invitation with highly
advanced technology


107
0:5:55,49 --> 0:5:58,489
military testy maybe predictable


108
0:5:58,489 --> 0:6:1,559
but it's not the end of the war


109
0:6:1,559 --> 0:6:5,55
on likely victories have happened before


110
0:6:5,55 --> 0:6:9,77
dekh ke gary for humanity get last as
long as they possibly can


111
0:6:9,77 --> 0:6:16,31
and do things like the mujahadeen did in
the uh... soviet f_b_i_ more relaxed


112
0:6:16,31 --> 0:6:18,78
where they used terrorist type


113
0:6:18,78 --> 0:6:20,819
livers and rebellion too


114
0:6:20,819 --> 0:6:22,62
vindicates a larger


115
0:6:22,62 --> 0:6:27,599
more technologically superior force


116
0:6:27,599 --> 0:6:30,36
among the survivors left on earth


117
0:6:30,36 --> 0:6:32,12
incase


118
0:6:32,12 --> 0:6:33,279
forests


119
0:6:33,279 --> 0:6:37,979
and desert all over the planet


120
0:6:37,979 --> 0:6:46,65
they always this season's of rebellion


121
0:6:46,65 --> 0:6:50,599
alien invasion has calmed


122
0:6:50,599 --> 0:6:53,22
now it's time for earth


123
0:6:53,22 --> 0:6:59,8
to fight


124
0:6:59,8 --> 0:7:14,77
god


125
0:7:14,77 --> 0:7:19,129
unquestioned rises in the mind


126
0:7:19,129 --> 0:7:23,289
why


127
0:7:23,289 --> 0:7:26,319
employed


128
0:7:26,319 --> 0:7:28,229
humanity survive


129
0:7:28,229 --> 0:7:33,139
and uh... answering this question


130
0:7:33,139 --> 0:7:36,43
i don't think they would come on some
random slumbering nation i think that


131
0:7:36,43 --> 0:7:38,509
would attack us the farm


132
0:7:38,509 --> 0:7:40,289
fl


133
0:7:40,289 --> 0:7:42,99
bynoe means clearly


134
0:7:42,99 --> 0:7:45,949
aliens haven't destroyed our planet


135
0:7:45,949 --> 0:7:49,799
just our civilization


136
0:7:49,799 --> 0:7:52,9
in the plan for ending


137
0:7:52,9 --> 0:7:58,659
dr trappist taylor is cleaned out the
most likely markets for hostel


138
0:7:58,659 --> 0:7:59,879
conquest


139
0:7:59,879 --> 0:8:1,289
harvesting


140
0:8:1,289 --> 0:8:3,58
or hunting


141
0:8:3,58 --> 0:8:4,83
at best


142
0:8:4,83 --> 0:8:8,36
there simply looking for supplies


143
0:8:8,36 --> 0:8:9,589
maybe


144
0:8:9,589 --> 0:8:13,949
there's something here on our planet
they will


145
0:8:13,949 --> 0:8:24,429
one possibility is the most important
resource on the planet


146
0:8:24,429 --> 0:8:28,369
but he is water that we're


147
0:8:28,369 --> 0:8:31,119
discoveries about planets and moves


148
0:8:31,119 --> 0:8:38,16
both in our solar system antigua in the
galaxy review a different story


149
0:8:38,16 --> 0:8:42,56
water headquarters one of the most
common compounds any others


150
0:8:42,56 --> 0:8:44,98
so they don't have anymore and


151
0:8:44,98 --> 0:8:49,41
the invaders meeting the difference in
order to determine the treatment


152
0:8:49,41 --> 0:8:52,89
but that's the real to has problems


153
0:8:52,89 --> 0:8:55,429
fayed minerals minerals exist elsewhere


154
0:8:55,429 --> 0:8:57,52
the largest you're on there


155
0:8:57,52 --> 0:9:1,15
other planets like actually be more
attractive


156
0:9:1,15 --> 0:9:5,25
the solar system is full of resources


157
0:9:5,25 --> 0:9:11,5
in fact a single asteroid can continue
gold and silver aluminum nsync and has


158
0:9:11,5 --> 0:9:17,2
been excavated in bowl of human history


159
0:9:17,2 --> 0:9:20,35
but the canyons malignant become clearer


160
0:9:20,35 --> 0:9:21,24
as history


161
0:9:21,24 --> 0:9:23,389
chinnu vehicle begins to patrol


162
0:9:23,389 --> 0:9:40,11

163
0:9:40,11 --> 0:9:47,21
vessel stripped


164
0:9:47,21 --> 0:9:52,84
units are harvested troop compounds on
purpose


165
0:9:52,84 --> 0:9:59,94
that our astronomers involve nowhere
else in the know universe


166
0:9:59,94 --> 0:10:1,99
chlorophyll


167
0:10:1,99 --> 0:10:3,87
and protein


168
0:10:3,87 --> 0:10:5,35
plants


169
0:10:5,35 --> 0:10:10,47
and and


170
0:10:10,47 --> 0:10:19,4
deletions are harvesting life


171
0:10:19,4 --> 0:10:21,89
even prescriptions


172
0:10:21,89 --> 0:10:28,23
long-distance migrations of often driven
by the need to find a new sources of


173
0:10:28,23 --> 0:10:31,52
different these institutions have
completed the resource is something


174
0:10:31,52 --> 0:10:34,73
reform with that


175
0:10:34,73 --> 0:10:37,4
does talent


176
0:10:37,4 --> 0:10:39,63
deflected common attack


177
0:10:39,63 --> 0:10:42,98
status quo unlike anything that would
come folks up to the got the comes


178
0:10:42,98 --> 0:10:51,68
someone was like in a somewhat like a
plays a blossoming ecosystem


179
0:10:51,68 --> 0:10:52,7
politician


180
0:10:52,7 --> 0:10:54,17
didn't survive


181
0:10:54,17 --> 0:10:58,19
base of the new features with superior
technology


182
0:10:58,19 --> 0:11:7,3
who may be hunted


183
0:11:7,3 --> 0:11:9,66
with cbs destroyed


184
0:11:9,66 --> 0:11:13,46
remnants of humanity here on the run


185
0:11:13,46 --> 0:11:16,65
survivors must learn how to live


186
0:11:16,65 --> 0:11:22,35
with nothing


187
0:11:22,35 --> 0:11:23,93
life after


188
0:11:23,93 --> 0:11:26,3
an alien attack


189
0:11:26,3 --> 0:11:29,57
or any sort of global disaster


190
0:11:29,57 --> 0:11:32,17
literally unimaginable


191
0:11:32,17 --> 0:11:33,879
simply access to


192
0:11:33,879 --> 0:11:36,41
clean water and food


193
0:11:36,41 --> 0:11:39,33
will be


194
0:11:39,33 --> 0:11:42,43
the happy prepare for that mentally as
much as anything


195
0:11:42,43 --> 0:11:45,22
it's about having the will to survive


196
0:11:45,22 --> 0:11:47,3
if you fail


197
0:11:47,3 --> 0:11:52,86
there will be no wonder right rat


198
0:11:52,86 --> 0:11:58,88
rubin chaos in the field evacuations to
thousands in the first day


199
0:11:58,88 --> 0:12:4,83
more dot as food and water run out over
the next days and weeks


200
0:12:4,83 --> 0:12:9,1
lack of preparation becomes a death
sentence


201
0:12:9,1 --> 0:12:12,69
i would say seventy percent of people
probably won't survive


202
0:12:12,69 --> 0:12:17,73
simply because they have taken no side
uh... supports any kind of preparation


203
0:12:17,73 --> 0:12:22,72
or any kind of knowledge of what it
takes


204
0:12:22,72 --> 0:12:25,36
with basic survival


205
0:12:25,36 --> 0:12:27,31
instruments now have the


206
0:12:27,31 --> 0:12:30,8
and he's trying to huh


207
0:12:30,8 --> 0:12:35,2
destroyed them


208
0:12:35,2 --> 0:12:37,52
but some will make it


209
0:12:37,52 --> 0:12:41,42
a person survival depends on preparation


210
0:12:41,42 --> 0:12:48,47
learning new skills and developing might
mental attitude for a new


211
0:12:48,47 --> 0:12:51,61
resourcefulness is paramount


212
0:12:51,61 --> 0:12:56,2
ordinary tools become lifesavers


213
0:12:56,2 --> 0:13:1,28
scavenge supplies canned food and clean
water will be vital for the first two


214
0:13:1,28 --> 0:13:2,3
