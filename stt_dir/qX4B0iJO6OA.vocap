###29 aka the sister is the end of it is their words did uses that
###34 clearly anti american of said the guy in an incredible brigid fred
###40 qatar hands the
###42 the larges
###43 the u_s_ military base in the middle east
###45 card yes on sponsors your
###48 uh... we have been
###50 in maisie relations with qatar the u_s_ government has now you can criticize
###53 that relationship and there's legitimate grounds to do so but the claim that
###56 print card is somehow anti american when they have the lord's military base
###61 and this
###62 decades long regulation for the u_s_ is
###65 plays ito clearly and uh...
###67 but now a little earlier clearly particularly doubt it's if i had
###72 interest in the eighty american you know when i do by said of the largest
###75 american military bases in the region to love our last three
###78 orders have watched from there
