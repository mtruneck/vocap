2
0:0:9,4 --> 0:0:11,15
MITT ROMNEY: Drug trafficking,
that's one more of those areas


3
0:0:11,15 --> 0:0:11,88
of concern.


4
0:0:11,88 --> 0:0:14,6
It's time for the United States
of America to take


5
0:0:14,6 --> 0:0:18,31
responsibility for the pain,
and suffering, and torture,


6
0:0:18,31 --> 0:0:22,0
and murder that's going on
throughout Latin America.


7
0:0:22,0 --> 0:0:23,89
SHANE SMITH: Maybe one of the
reasons that Mitt Romney is so


8
0:0:23,89 --> 0:0:26,38
concerned with the drug wars
taking place just south of the


9
0:0:26,38 --> 0:0:30,41
American border is that it
affects him and his family


10
0:0:30,41 --> 0:0:31,52
personally.


11
0:0:31,52 --> 0:0:33,93
Hi, I'm Shane Smith and we're
here at the VICE headquarters


12
0:0:33,93 --> 0:0:35,1
in Williamsburg, Brooklyn.


13
0:0:35,1 --> 0:0:38,84
Now Williamsburg is ground zero
for hipsters, which means


14
0:0:38,84 --> 0:0:41,95
it's also ground zero for
partying, which means it's


15
0:0:41,95 --> 0:0:44,0
ground zero for cocaine.


16
0:0:44,0 --> 0:0:46,79
Now VICE has talked a lot about
cocaine over the years.


17
0:0:46,79 --> 0:0:50,67
In fact, one of our magazine
covers featured a mirror with


18
0:0:50,67 --> 0:0:52,28
a big line of coke
chopped up on it.


19
0:0:52,28 --> 0:0:55,7
But recently we followed a story
that made us think twice


20
0:0:55,7 --> 0:0:57,98
about our historical fascination
with coke.


21
0:0:57,98 --> 0:0:59,73
And it has to do
with Mormons--


22
0:0:59,73 --> 0:1:2,52
as in Mitt Romney's family
type Mormons--


23
0:1:2,52 --> 0:1:7,4
Mexican drug cartels, polygamy,
kidnapping, cocaine,


24
0:1:7,4 --> 0:1:9,45
and finally, murder.


25
0:1:9,45 --> 0:1:11,41
Now it's a freaky,
freaky story.


26
0:1:11,41 --> 0:1:14,9
And it's taking place just
south of the US border.


27
0:1:14,9 --> 0:1:16,22
So we went to check it
out first hand to see


28
0:1:16,22 --> 0:1:17,47
what was going on.


29
0:1:17,47 --> 0:1:22,56



30
0:1:22,56 --> 0:1:25,8
We just passed through from El
Paso, Texas, which is actually


31
0:1:25,8 --> 0:1:28,53
one of the safest cities in
America, into Juarez, Mexico,


32
0:1:28,53 --> 0:1:29,81
which is actually one of
the most dangerous


33
0:1:29,81 --> 0:1:30,92
cities in the world.


34
0:1:30,92 --> 0:1:32,99
In fact, it's the most dangerous
city in the world


35
0:1:32,99 --> 0:1:34,22
for journalists.


36
0:1:34,22 --> 0:1:36,9
And we're driving with a camera
rolling, which is, in


37
0:1:36,9 --> 0:1:40,75
retrospect, very
fucking stupid.


38
0:1:40,75 --> 0:1:43,523
People always ask me what the
most dangerous place I've ever


39
0:1:43,523 --> 0:1:43,886
been to is.


40
0:1:43,886 --> 0:1:46,175
And when I say Mexico, they're
a bit flummoxed


41
0:1:46,175 --> 0:1:47,38
and they say, Mexico?


42
0:1:47,38 --> 0:1:48,2
I've been to Mexico.


43
0:1:48,2 --> 0:1:51,22
I've been to Cancun, Joe's
tequila foam party,


44
0:1:51,22 --> 0:1:52,55
and Boom Boom Room.


45
0:1:52,55 --> 0:1:55,23
But this Mexico here in Juarez,
is the Mexico run by


46
0:1:55,23 --> 0:1:56,11
the narco lords.


47
0:1:56,11 --> 0:1:58,7
They don't care about what
you're shooting.


48
0:1:58,7 --> 0:1:59,88
They don't walk up and say, hey,
what's that camera for?


49
0:1:59,88 --> 0:2:3,63
They just see a camera and go,
that can't good, and bam.


50
0:2:3,63 --> 0:2:6,23
Now the drug lords that rule
northern Mexico are like most


51
0:2:6,23 --> 0:2:7,2
mafia around the world.


52
0:2:7,2 --> 0:2:10,11
They're very wealthy, and
they're insanely ruthless.


53
0:2:10,11 --> 0:2:12,43
But the thing that sets the
Mexican cartels apart from the


54
0:2:12,43 --> 0:2:16,19
other mobs is their seemingly
profound love of murder.


55
0:2:16,19 --> 0:2:18,78



56
0:2:18,78 --> 0:2:20,93
They put other crime syndicates
to shame with the


57
0:2:20,93 --> 0:2:23,86
sheer scale of their killing,
not to mention the gruesome


58
0:2:23,86 --> 0:2:26,73
eye-catching way they present
their murders with a kind of


59
0:2:26,73 --> 0:2:27,98
evil inventiveness.


60
0:2:27,98 --> 0:2:31,42



61
0:2:31,42 --> 0:2:34,58
And it's not just traditional
gang on gang violence either.


62
0:2:34,58 --> 0:2:37,78
The cartels kill anyone and
everyone in their way.


63
0:2:37,78 --> 0:2:40,15
Rivals, witnesses, journalists,
politicians, and


64
0:2:40,15 --> 0:2:42,5
police are all targets.


65
0:2:42,5 --> 0:2:44,59
And rather than hiding the
bodies like most criminals,


66
0:2:44,59 --> 0:2:46,65
they actually want
you to see them.


67
0:2:46,65 --> 0:2:50,93
And they want you to know
exactly who did it.


68
0:2:50,93 --> 0:2:54,51
In fact, the war on drugs in
Mexico is so violent that its


69
0:2:54,51 --> 0:2:58,31
body count is almost 10 times
that of American soldiers


70
0:2:58,31 --> 0:3:2,67
killed in the real wars in
Iraq and Afghanistan.


71
0:3:2,67 --> 0:3:5,0
And in a country where it's
supposedly illegal to own


72
0:3:5,0 --> 0:3:8,6
guns, the narcos are armed
to the teeth with


73
0:3:8,6 --> 0:3:12,27
state-of-the-art weaponry, 90%
of which are smuggled in from


74
0:3:12,27 --> 0:3:14,99
the United States, which is
something we got to see first


75
0:3:14,99 --> 0:3:17,75
hand as soon as we arrived
in Juarez.


76
0:3:17,75 --> 0:3:19,64



77
0:3:19,64 --> 0:3:20,89
MEXICAN OFFICIAL:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]


78
0:3:20,89 --> 0:3:29,39



79
0:3:29,39 --> 0:3:32,8
SHANE SMITH: We came in here and
we saw this huge bunker.


80
0:3:32,8 --> 0:3:32,73
And we're like, oh.


81
0:3:32,73 --> 0:3:36,51
This is where they hold all the
guns, and all the drugs,


82
0:3:36,51 --> 0:3:39,11
and everything in this big,
massive concrete bunker.


83
0:3:39,11 --> 0:3:39,86
And they're like, no, no.


84
0:3:39,86 --> 0:3:42,2
The drugs and the guns are
here in the trucks.


85
0:3:42,2 --> 0:3:43,845
That's a nightclub called
the Sphinx.


86
0:3:43,845 --> 0:3:46,71



87
0:3:46,71 --> 0:3:50,75
So last night the police caught
these guys trying to


88
0:3:50,75 --> 0:3:55,43
smuggle in 268,000 rounds of
ammunition in a truck with


89
0:3:55,43 --> 0:3:56,57
Oklahoma plates.


90
0:3:56,57 --> 0:3:59,52
It was driven by a
guy from Dallas.


91
0:3:59,52 --> 0:4:3,58
Over a quarter million rounds
of ammunition, this is the


92
0:4:3,58 --> 0:4:5,18
kind of firepower
that they have.


93
0:4:5,18 --> 0:4:13,78



94
0:4:13,78 --> 0:4:16,709
This is a .30 caliber Browning,
which shoots super


95
0:4:16,709 --> 0:4:19,55
fast and can shoot through
armored cars.


96
0:4:19,55 --> 0:4:22,1
And then they have this
anti-aircraft, .50 cal.


97
0:4:22,1 --> 0:4:23,1
Can I pick it up?


98
0:4:23,1 --> 0:4:23,25
MALE SPEAKER 1: No.


99
0:4:23,25 --> 0:4:23,4
No.


100
0:4:23,4 --> 0:4:23,94
You can't touch that.


101
0:4:23,94 --> 0:4:24,69
SHANE SMITH: Shit, I did.


102
0:4:24,69 --> 0:4:26,12
I put my finger on it.


103
0:4:26,12 --> 0:4:27,69
I'm going to get in trouble.


104
0:4:27,69 --> 0:4:29,88
They just confiscated
these weapons.


105
0:4:29,88 --> 0:4:31,62
And I touched the .50 cal.


106
0:4:31,62 --> 0:4:33,52
And they haven't dusted
them for prints yet.


107
0:4:33,52 --> 0:4:35,54
So now my prints are
on a murder weapon.


108
0:4:35,54 --> 0:4:38,38
Not good.

MEXICAN OFFICIAL:

110
0:4:39,63 --> 0:4:44,12



111
0:4:44,12 --> 0:4:46,7
MITT ROMNEY: These look like
they're from America.


112
0:4:46,7 --> 0:4:49,0
America, America, America, all
the guns are from America.


113
0:4:49,0 --> 0:4:49,9
They're all homicides?


114
0:4:49,9 --> 0:4:50,73
They've tested them out?


115
0:4:50,73 --> 0:4:51,98
MEXICAN OFFICIAL:
[SPEAKING SPANISH]


116
0:4:51,98 --> 0:4:54,73



117
0:4:54,73 --> 0:4:55,98
SHANE SMITH: Oh, sorry.


118
0:4:55,98 --> 0:4:59,65



119
0:4:59,65 --> 0:5:1,51
That was loud.


120
0:5:1,51 --> 0:5:3,9
It smells very strong.


121
0:5:3,9 --> 0:5:5,69
Holy Jesus, I know this doesn't
look like crazy.


122
0:5:5,69 --> 0:5:6,69
But you can smell.


123
0:5:6,69 --> 0:5:12,5
Wow, it's a lot of drugs,
drugs and flak jackets.


124
0:5:12,5 --> 0:5:14,7
So this is sort of a rustic
type of smuggling.


125
0:5:14,7 --> 0:5:16,5
They call it a burrero, which
is like a donkey.


126
0:5:16,5 --> 0:5:18,83
And they just walk through
the desert with the


127
0:5:18,83 --> 0:5:21,3
pot on their back.


128
0:5:21,3 --> 0:5:24,9
So the market for the
drugs is America.


129
0:5:24,9 --> 0:5:26,93
The market for the weapons
is here in Mexico.


130
0:5:26,93 --> 0:5:29,48
And they go like this.


131
0:5:29,48 --> 0:5:33,7
When you look at this, like
.50 cals, assault rifles,


132
0:5:33,7 --> 0:5:37,9
military grade machine guns,
you realize, OK, how do the


133
0:5:37,9 --> 0:5:39,47
police fight them, let along
regular people, let alone


134
0:5:39,47 --> 0:5:41,44
Mormons who aren't allowed
to own guns.


135
0:5:41,44 --> 0:5:42,69
It's crazy.


136
0:5:42,69 --> 0:5:45,37



137
0:5:45,37 --> 0:5:48,36
So we're about 200 miles
south of Juarez now.


138
0:5:48,36 --> 0:5:50,36
And we're out in the
middle of nowhere.


139
0:5:50,36 --> 0:5:52,44
This is like the narco
superhighway.


140
0:5:52,44 --> 0:5:55,5
There's actually 300 different
smuggling trails


141
0:5:55,5 --> 0:5:55,83
right through here.


142
0:5:55,83 --> 0:5:57,4
There's no big wall
or anything.


143
0:5:57,4 --> 0:5:59,34
You can just walk off into
the desert with your


144
0:5:59,34 --> 0:6:0,61
pack full of cocaine.


145
0:6:0,61 --> 0:6:2,905
And then, all of a sudden,
folks in Williamsburg and


146
0:6:2,905 --> 0:6:6,1
hipsters are doing coke.


147
0:6:6,1 --> 0:6:8,64
As you're out here, it kind of
dawns on you that there's


148
0:6:8,64 --> 0:6:9,73
nowhere to go.


149
0:6:9,73 --> 0:6:12,74
Like if something happens or
if somebody even chases us,


150
0:6:12,74 --> 0:6:14,26
where are we going to run to?


151
0:6:14,26 --> 0:6:16,24
Because you can't trust
the police.


152
0:6:16,24 --> 0:6:18,11
You especially can't trust the
local police because they're


153
0:6:18,11 --> 0:6:19,21
all corrupt.


154
0:6:19,21 --> 0:6:22,45
So basically, right now, it's
a straight shot to the


155
0:6:22,45 --> 0:6:24,975
Mormons, their guns,
and their god.


156
0:6:24,975 --> 0:6:31,11



157
0:6:31,11 --> 0:6:35,69
Ah, we've come to
God's country.


158
0:6:35,69 --> 0:6:37,87
MALE SPEAKER 2: Joel LeBaron
was killed by his


159
0:6:37,87 --> 0:6:39,23
own brother, Ervil.


160
0:6:39,23 --> 0:6:42,11
He started to kill in
the name of God.


161
0:6:42,11 --> 0:6:43,36
SHANE SMITH: That's
some crazy shit.


162
0:6:43,36 --> 0:8:43,36
