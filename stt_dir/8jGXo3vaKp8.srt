1
0:0:0,8 --> 0:0:3,59
As the Mid Ocean Ridge pulls apart


2
0:0:3,59 --> 0:0:7,15
there's decompression of the material underneath it, and that creates melting


3
0:0:7,15 --> 0:0:11,28
Decompression is simply removing the pressure from a pile of rock


4
0:0:11,28 --> 0:0:13,25
it's much like opening a can of soda


5
0:0:13,25 --> 0:0:15,96
or popping the cork off of a champagne bottle


6
0:0:15,96 --> 0:0:18,8
The removal of so much pressure


7
0:0:18,8 --> 0:0:21,1
makes the rock melt into liquid magma


8
0:0:21,1 --> 0:0:24,98
And the Hot Spot is transporting heat directly from the interior of the earth to the surface


9
0:0:24,98 --> 0:0:27,8
which also creates melting


10
0:0:27,8 --> 0:0:30,69
So this combination of decompression of existing rock beneath the surface


11
0:0:30,69 --> 0:0:37,9
and the direct transport of heat from the center of the earth created huge amounts of magma


12
0:0:37,9 --> 0:0:40,98
This incredible meeting of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and Hot Spot


13
0:0:40,98 --> 0:0:43,85
began to build the island beneath the waves


14
0:0:43,85 --> 0:0:49,37
pushing it upwards and giving birth to Iceland


15
0:0:49,37 --> 0:0:52,75
Scientists have dated the island's emergence to 20 million years ago


16
0:0:52,75 --> 0:0:56,19
but could only imagine what this might have looked like


17
0:0:56,19 --> 0:1:1,53
But on November 14th, 1963, off the south coast of Iceland


18
0:1:1,53 --> 0:1:10,39
The world watched an action-replay of Iceland's spectacular birth


19
0:1:10,39 --> 0:1:13,73
A column of rock and ash blasted out of the ocean


20
0:1:13,73 --> 0:1:16,8
18.000 feet (5.400 m) into the sky


21
0:1:16,8 --> 0:1:23,31
So high it could be seen 70 miles (110 Km) away in Iceland's capital city, Reykjavík


22
0:1:23,31 --> 0:1:30,55
A new island was forming, right in front of the world's eyes


23
0:1:30,55 --> 0:1:38,91
Scientists called it Surtsey after the Norse god of fire: Surtr


24
0:1:38,91 --> 0:1:40,96
Located 20 miles (32 Km) off the mainland,


25
0:1:40,96 --> 0:1:46,22
the small island of Surtsey is now a magnet for geologists


26
0:1:46,22 --> 0:1:49,66
It offers a wealth of forensic evidence for Dr. La Femina,


27
0:1:49,66 --> 0:1:56,6
who is investigating how Iceland first formed


28
0:1:56,6 --> 0:1:58,7
It'a amazing to see Surtsey for the first time


29
0:1:58,7 --> 0:2:0,83
I've seen pictures, I've seen aerial photographs


30
0:2:0,83 --> 0:2:3,87
but actually be here and get a chance to 


31
0:2:3,87 --> 0:2:6,4
to go out and see it up close and actually look at the geology


32
0:2:6,4 --> 0:2:15,68
it's just inspiring


33
0:2:15,68 --> 0:2:19,64
This type of eruption that formed Surtsey has now been named after Surtsey


34
0:2:19,64 --> 0:2:21,22
We call them "Surtseyan Eruptions",


35
0:2:21,22 --> 0:2:23,82
and they're very, very explosive


36
0:2:23,82 --> 0:2:27,7
The interaction of hot magma or lava with the ocean


37
0:2:27,7 --> 0:2:31,8
causes these very steam-rich and highly explosive eruptions


38
0:2:31,8 --> 0:2:34,29
of ash and water


39
0:2:34,29 --> 0:2:38,61
When scientists first stepped foot into the island in the summer of '64


40
0:2:38,61 --> 0:2:42,16
they found it hard to believe that this was an island whose age


41
0:2:42,16 --> 0:2:45,17
was measured in MONTHS, not millenia


42
0:2:45,17 --> 0:2:50,75
In about 9,5 months this whole volcanic cone built up


43
0:2:50,75 --> 0:2:54,66
In addition, lava flows came out of the volcanic center here


44
0:2:54,66 --> 0:2:59,25
and we seen those as nice black cliffs in front of us


45
0:2:59,25 --> 0:3:4,45
Now geologists had an insight into how early Iceland might have formed


46
0:3:4,45 --> 0:3:12,67
In only 20 million years, Iceland grew from a tiny island into a 40.000 square mile (104.000 Km2) landmass,


47
0:3:12,67 --> 0:3:17,64
as big as the state of Kentucky


48
0:3:17,64 --> 0:3:20,15
The forces that powered Iceland's volcanoes


49
0:3:20,15 --> 0:3:22,64
have been revealed


50
0:3:22,64 --> 0:3:28,88
Cracks along Hekla volcano unleashed gigantic fissure eruptions


51
0:3:28,88 --> 0:3:31,98
and rare chemicals in the rock proved


52
0:3:31,98 --> 0:3:36,13
that these eruptions were fuelled by two separated forces:


53
0:3:36,13 --> 0:3:40,51
Mid-Atlantic Ridge and the Hot Spot


54
0:3:40,51 --> 0:3:45,71
Iceland grew to become the world's largest volcanic island


55
0:3:45,71 --> 0:3:51,41
But volcanism alone doesn't explain how the land of Iceland was formed


56
0:3:51,41 --> 0:3:55,21
The investigation will honour another equally dramatic force


57
0:3:55,21 --> 0:3:59,44
that sculpted the distinctive shape of the Iceland we know today


58
0:3:59,44 --> 0:4:11,83
A force which would challenge the might of Iceland's volcanoes


59
0:4:11,83 --> 0:4:13,93
If Iceland was formed by fire alone,


60
0:4:13,93 --> 0:4:18,46
it should look like other volcanic islands such as Hawaii or Tahiti


61
0:4:18,46 --> 0:4:23,24
But something else was at work here to transform this island


62
0:4:23,24 --> 0:4:27,69
into the distinctive shape it is today


63
0:4:27,69 --> 0:4:31,99
Its shape is another clue to Iceland's formation


64
0:4:31,99 --> 0:4:35,85
An extraordinary force indented Iceland's Northern coastline


65
0:4:35,85 --> 0:4:41,35
burrowing deep fjords which extended far inland


66
0:4:41,35 --> 0:4:47,63
But, what colossal force could cause such a dramatic change to Iceland's volcanic landscape?


67
0:4:47,63 --> 0:4:52,8
There's an obvious suspect that is found scattered across the island:


68
0:4:52,8 --> 0:4:54,18
Ice


69
0:4:54,18 --> 0:5:2,18
As its name suggests, Iceland has a long history of being covered in ice, like this


70
0:5:2,18 --> 0:5:4,87
Today it covers 10% of the island


71
0:5:4,87 --> 0:5:7,7
all year round


72
0:5:7,7 --> 0:5:12,42
And in the middle of the country lies Europe's biggest ice cap:


73
0:5:12,42 --> 0:5:17,3
The mighty Vatnajökull


74
0:5:17,3 --> 0:5:19,13
Over 3000 square miles (7.800 Km2) in size


75
0:5:19,13 --> 0:5:27,34
Vatnajökull is so large it even has its own climatic conditions


76
0:5:27,34 --> 0:5:28,98
Up to two thirds of a mile (1 Km) thick,


77
0:5:28,98 --> 0:5:32,51
it squashes the land like a giant slab of rock


78
0:5:32,51 --> 0:5:35,18
and at its edges great tongues of ice


79
0:5:35,18 --> 0:5:44,9
flow out through deep valleys


80
0:5:44,9 --> 0:5:46,92
Glacier expert Dr. Mattew Roberts


81
0:5:46,92 --> 0:5:50,62
is investigating how ice can gauge out solid rock


82
0:5:50,62 --> 0:6:0,1
and discover the role it is playing in Iceland's past


83
0:6:0,1 --> 0:6:3,68
This is a GPS receiver, just like in car satellite navigation


84
0:6:3,68 --> 0:6:6,34
it's used here to measure glacier movement


85
0:6:6,34 --> 0:6:8,1
this will be left on the ice surface for a few days


86
0:6:8,1 --> 0:6:10,26
and I'll come back and analyse the data


87
0:6:10,26 --> 0:6:14,95
to discover just how far the glacier has moved


88
0:6:14,95 --> 0:6:19,64
Dr. Roberts data reveals that this whole glacier is sliding forward


89
0:6:19,64 --> 0:6:24,38
at an astounding rate of 2 feet (0,6 m) ... per day!


90
0:6:24,38 --> 0:6:27,58
This is an amazing ever changing environement: The ice around me is like


91
0:6:27,58 --> 0:6:30,88
an icy sea that has been frozen in place


92
0:6:30,88 --> 0:6:34,27
As the ice flows out to the confines of the valley


93
0:6:34,27 --> 0:6:36,97
it expands, it spreads to occupy a greater area


94
0:6:36,97 --> 0:6:39,56
Now as it expands, crevasses form


95
0:6:39,56 --> 0:6:42,1
In large depressions, just like the one here,


96
0:6:42,1 --> 0:6:44,81
(here's a smaller crevasse that is formed)


97
0:6:44,81 --> 0:6:47,38
ocasionally when these crevasses open, as it begin to open,


98
0:6:47,38 --> 0:6:49,46
sounds can be heard


99
0:6:49,46 --> 0:6:53,26
Also, the glacier ocasionally makes a groaning sound


100
0:6:53,26 --> 0:6:56,39
it's all signs that the glacier is alive and moving forward


101
0:6:56,39 --> 0:7:0,25
very slowly


102
0:7:0,25 --> 0:7:6,14
Vatnajökull is one of the largest ice caps in the northern hemisphere


103
0:7:6,14 --> 0:7:8,96
flowing down the valleys, the great mass of ice


104
0:7:8,96 --> 0:7:14,46
bears down with the weight of 100 tons per square foot (975 tons/m2) 


105
0:7:14,46 --> 0:7:17,51
Dr. Roberts believes this moving giant is a force


106
0:7:17,51 --> 0:7:19,61
capable of eroding solid rock,


107
0:7:19,61 --> 0:7:22,96
and he has found crucial evidence to prove it


108
0:7:22,96 --> 0:7:26,19
This is an excellent example of the power of glacial erosion


109
0:7:26,19 --> 0:7:28,92
This boulder would have been trapped beneath the base of the ice


110
0:7:28,92 --> 0:7:31,2
and, as the ice flowed over the surface of it,


111
0:7:31,2 --> 0:7:34,4
it would have progressively eroded the surface of the boulder


112
0:7:34,4 --> 0:7:38,3
to produce these very distinctive marks, called striations, in its surface


113
0:7:38,3 --> 0:7:41,53
We can even tell the direction in wich the ice was flowing


114
0:7:41,53 --> 0:7:44,4
If I take a rock, I can illustrate this


115
0:7:44,4 --> 0:7:47,17
Imagine this is the base of the ice,


116
0:7:47,17 --> 0:7:49,27
the material trapped inside the ice


117
0:7:49,27 --> 0:7:52,52
being dragged across as the glacier moved


118
0:7:52,52 --> 0:7:56,8
to produce this very distinctive marks in the surface


119
0:7:56,8 --> 0:7:58,85
This is just like sandpaper over wood,


120
0:7:58,85 --> 0:8:1,55
the same erosive effect


121
0:8:1,55 --> 0:8:4,76
The erosive process that's happening on this boulder


122
0:8:4,76 --> 0:8:7,96
is the same process that's happening on a much larger scale


123
0:8:7,96 --> 0:8:10,24
along the surface of these valleys


124
0:8:10,24 --> 0:8:13,87
The glacier is responsible for literally carving the landscape,


125
0:8:13,87 --> 0:8:17,31
producing very distinctive throughs and basins


126
0:8:17,31 --> 0:8:19,54
which were formerly infilled with solid rock


127
0:8:19,54 --> 0:8:25,46
This really testifies the erosive power of a glacier


128
0:8:25,46 --> 0:8:27,28
The ancient fjords on the north coast


129
0:8:27,28 --> 0:8:30,99
are the same deep-basin shape


130
0:8:30,99 --> 0:8:36,49
Which means they must once have been filled with ice


131
0:8:36,49 --> 0:8:40,9
Scientists now know that around 1,5 million years ago


132
0:8:40,9 --> 0:8:43,49
changes in the earth's orbit and the tilt of its axis


133
0:8:43,49 --> 0:8:47,73
began to cool the planet


134
0:8:47,73 --> 0:8:50,54
An enormous ice sheet descended from the north


135
0:8:50,54 --> 0:8:55,78
and shrouded Iceland in a cloak of ice


136
0:8:55,78 --> 0:8:57,79
As the ice advanced and retreated,


137
0:8:57,79 --> 0:8:59,79
it carved out deep fjords


138
0:8:59,79 --> 0:9:4,37
and indented Iceland's northern coastline


139
0:9:4,37 --> 0:9:7,19
Ice was a formidable force in Iceland


140
0:9:7,19 --> 0:9:12,27
and many volcanoes laid at tomb beneath it


141
0:9:12,27 --> 0:9:17,25
Fire and ice were now locked in a titanic battle of supremacy


142
0:9:17,25 --> 0:9:20,41
When the giant ice sheets that carved the fjords


143
0:9:20,41 --> 0:9:29,99
put out the fires that created Iceland


144
0:9:29,99 --> 0:9:36,3
The first clue lies in this ancient valley, 5 miles (8 Km) west of the glacier


145
0:9:36,3 --> 0:9:39,7
The valley floor is strewed with hundreds of giant boulders


146
0:9:39,7 --> 0:9:44,48
but it's how they got here that interests Dr. Roberts


147
0:9:44,48 --> 0:9:48,81
These boulders provide a lot of insight into how this landscape was formed


148
0:9:48,81 --> 0:9:51,52
The boulders clusted together and, interestingly,


149
0:9:51,52 --> 0:9:54,98
this boulders are rounded, which shows they've been rolling


150
0:9:54,98 --> 0:9:58,54
And the boulders have been brought together by some dynamical force


151
0:9:58,54 --> 0:10:1,62
We can also see smaller boulders trapped in the center


152
0:10:1,62 --> 0:10:4,76
And it's quite clear that flowing water is the cause of this


153
0:10:4,76 --> 0:10:8,96
But this would haven't been water in the stream that we see in the background


154
0:10:8,96 --> 0:10:13,28
this would have been water produced by a much larger, faster flow


155
0:10:13,28 --> 0:10:17,1
that would have inundated this entire valley


156
0:10:17,1 --> 0:10:21,77
Dr. Roberts has an extraordinay theory about what happened here:


157
0:10:21,77 --> 0:10:28,6
In ancient times, a cataclysmic flood 100 feet (30 m) high cut through this valley


158
0:10:28,6 --> 0:10:32,92
It was so powerful that it rolled this giant boulders like pebbles in a stream


159
0:10:32,92 --> 0:10:38,31
before dumping them on the landscape


160
0:10:38,31 --> 0:10:43,48
But what could create such a colossal flow of water?


161
0:10:43,48 --> 0:10:47,92
Dr. Roberts suspects the flood came from the mighty Vatnajökull glacier


162
0:10:47,92 --> 0:10:52,13
and he's hunting for clues


163
0:10:52,13 --> 0:11:3,17
With such a huge area to cover, Dr. Roberts takes to the air


164
0:11:3,17 --> 0:11:8,58
His investigation leads him to a crucial peace of evidence:


165
0:11:8,58 --> 0:11:13,58
This strange bowl-like depression on the surface of the ice


166
0:11:13,58 --> 0:11:17,99
This is an amazing location. This giant depression in the ice has been formed


167
0:11:17,99 --> 0:11:22,47
as a pocket of water drained from beneath the base of the ice cap


168
0:11:22,47 --> 0:11:26,56
The beautiful concentric crevasses that you see on the ice surface were formed


169
0:11:26,56 --> 0:11:35,95
as the ice slowly crept into the hole of this pit created as the waters drained the way


170
0:11:35,95 --> 0:11:39,45
Beneath the ice, a dynamic process is happening


171
0:11:39,45 --> 0:11:44,97
Hot magma and steam are melting the glacier from underneath


172
0:11:44,97 --> 0:11:50,47
The meltwater collects in a huge ice basin at the top of the volcano


173
0:11:50,47 --> 0:11:58,67
The basin slowly fills. But as it does, the surrounding ice becomes unstable,


174
0:11:58,67 --> 0:12:2,33
cracks up here, in the ice basin. And as the hot water drains away, 


175
0:12:2,33 --> 0:12:9,12
it forms a tunnel which channels the water to the edge of the glacier


176
0:12:9,12 --> 0:12:16,92
This would suggest that volcanic eruptions still happen even under the enormous weight of ice


177
0:12:16,92 --> 0:12:22,49
Is this process the key to explaining the ancient cataclysmic flood?


178
0:12:22,49 --> 0:12:28,82
To answer this, we must go to one of Iceland's largest volcanoes:


179
0:12:28,82 --> 0:12:31,3
Grímsvötn


180
0:12:31,3 --> 0:12:35,14
Lying entombed beneath the ice in the heart of Vatnajökull


181
0:12:35,14 --> 0:12:41,42
This massive volcano violently erupts every 10 years


182
0:12:41,42 --> 0:12:49,72
Here fire and ice spectacularly collide, with Iceland's volcanoes emerging victorious


183
0:12:49,72 --> 0:12:53,71
Ice cannot supress the invincible power of Iceland's volcanoes


184
0:12:53,71 --> 0:12:59,39
which have now found a new way to vent their anger


185
0:12:59,39 --> 0:13:3,85
During a huge eruption like this, Grímsvötn can melt enough ice


186
0:13:3,85 --> 0:13:8,79
to fill America's largest man-made reservoir: Lake Mead


187
0:13:8,79 --> 0:13:13,0
But this vast volume of water cannot be held back by the ice for long


188
0:13:13,0 --> 0:13:18,36
and leads inevitabily to a massive glacial flood


189
0:13:18,36 --> 0:13:25,6
Such a force of nature struck Iceland in 1996 with devastating consequences,


190
0:13:25,6 --> 0:13:30,5
the floodwater taking out everyting in its path


191
0:13:30,5 --> 0:13:33,46
Bridges were torn down and swept away


192
0:13:33,46 --> 0:13:38,63
and the highway was submerged under water


193
0:13:38,63 --> 0:13:44,58
The flood itself reached a peak discharge of over 1,8 million cubic feet per second (50.000 m3/s),


194
0:13:44,58 --> 0:13:49,32
that's a remarkable discharge, prevalent to the summertime discharge of the river Amazon


195
0:13:49,32 --> 0:13:55,47
Imagine that sort of condition over a relatively small area


196
0:13:55,47 --> 0:14:1,43
The sheer force of the water carried icebergs the size of 4 storey buildings


197
0:14:1,43 --> 0:14:7,59
It's floods like these that can change the landscape in a matter of days


198
0:14:7,59 --> 0:14:12,19
The erosive power of the flowing water can result in tremendous amounts of rock


199
0:14:12,19 --> 0:14:18,7
being eroded, literally being fractured away by the high water pressure that is being created


200
0:14:18,7 --> 0:14:25,25
so, literally a landscape can form before your eyes during a very severe glacial flood


201
0:14:25,25 --> 0:14:31,5
The story of Iceland's bizarre landscape is taking shape


202
0:14:31,5 --> 0:14:34,88
Striations on rock prove that ice is a formidable force


203
0:14:34,88 --> 0:14:39,5
that carved out Iceland's unique coastline


204
0:14:39,5 --> 0:14:41,29
Boulders strewn in an empty valley


205
0:14:41,29 --> 0:14:44,82
reveal cataclysmic floods of the past


206
0:14:44,82 --> 0:14:51,52
And depressions in the ice confirm that Iceland's volcanoes could not be supressed


207
0:14:51,52 --> 0:14:54,87
But 12.000 years ago the great ice sheets retreated


208
0:14:54,87 --> 0:14:58,65
and Iceland was liberated from their wintery grip,


209
0:14:58,65 --> 0:15:9,41
Now, the effects of Iceland's volcanoes would be felt on a global scale


210
0:15:9,41 --> 0:15:16,19
For thusands of years Iceland's volcanoes were locked in a titanic battle with ice


211
0:15:16,19 --> 0:15:22,96
But then, 12.000 years ago, the giant ice sheets finally retreated


212
0:15:22,96 --> 0:15:26,94
This would open a new chapter in Iceland's volcanic history,


213
0:15:26,94 --> 0:15:30,74
as they were now free to wreak havoc


214
0:15:30,74 --> 0:15:37,58
But, what effect would this have on Iceland and its surroundings?


215
0:15:37,58 --> 0:15:45,42
One of the most dramatic effects can be found in the south-central region of the island


216
0:15:45,42 --> 0:15:51,29
This alien landscape is known as Laki


217
0:15:51,29 --> 0:15:54,36
A road of strange craters and solidified lava flows


218
0:15:54,36 --> 0:15:59,3
that have bubbled up from a huge tear in the earth


219
0:15:59,3 --> 0:16:10,8
A massive fissure eruption, it stretches for an astounding 16 miles (25 Km) across the landscape


220
0:16:10,8 --> 0:16:13,61
Volcanologist Dr. Thor Thordarson is investigating Laki,


221
0:16:13,61 --> 0:16:17,37
the site of one of the greatest eruptions in recent history,


222
0:16:17,37 --> 0:16:21,98
one which would have devastating effects worldwide


223
0:16:21,98 --> 0:16:26,35
The Laki fissures, which extend from here in the southwest,


224
0:16:26,35 --> 0:16:32,49
continue here through the landscape as roll cones, up in through Mount Laki


225
0:16:32,49 --> 0:16:34,59
which was split into 2 during the eruption


226
0:16:34,59 --> 0:16:42,98
and continue futher to the northeast all the way to the margins of the glaciers here


227
0:16:42,98 --> 0:16:48,28
Eyewitness accounts accurately date the eruption to 1783


228
0:16:48,28 --> 0:16:53,73
This was one of the most disastrous years in Icelandic history


229
0:16:53,73 --> 0:16:58,55
Fallout from the eruption caused harvests all over the island to fail


230
0:16:58,55 --> 0:17:9,13
75% of the livestock died, plunging Iceland into a great famine which killed 10.000 people


231
0:17:9,13 --> 0:17:13,18
But mysteriously, at the same time the rest of the northern hemisphere


232
0:17:13,18 --> 0:17:17,63
reported freakishly cold weather


233
0:17:17,63 --> 0:17:26,19
Averaging 2,3 ºF (1,28ºC) below normal, the northern hemisphere froze over


234
0:17:26,19 --> 0:17:28,69
The North Sea along the coast of Holland froze,


235
0:17:28,69 --> 0:17:31,36
so people skated between villages along the coast


236
0:17:31,36 --> 0:17:39,66
There was on Mississippi down by New Orleans in that winter


237
0:17:39,66 --> 0:17:45,94
For many years it was thought the Laki eruption and this climatic events were unrelated,


238
0:17:45,94 --> 0:17:51,91
but advances in geology found it wasn't just a bizarre coincidence


239
0:17:51,91 --> 0:17:55,42
Comparing eyewitness accounts with the geological remains


240
0:17:55,42 --> 0:18:1,69
Dr. Thordarson has reconstructed what happened


241
0:18:1,69 --> 0:18:8,3
He discovered that the eruption started with a bang on the morning of June 8, 1783


242
0:18:8,3 --> 0:18:10,8
It sent rocks flying high into the air


243
0:18:10,8 --> 0:18:15,42
and ripped the earth open along a 1 mile (1,6 Km) tear


244
0:18:15,42 --> 0:18:19,27
But this was just the beginning


245
0:18:19,27 --> 0:18:26,61
3 days later, a second eruption ripped open, then a 3rd, 4th, 5th...


246
0:18:26,61 --> 0:18:31,63
In total, the earth unzipped along 10 vast tears in the crust


247
0:18:31,63 --> 0:18:36,95
erupting lava continuously for over 8 months


248
0:18:36,95 --> 0:18:40,5
The mammoth amounts of lava that poured out of the ground here


249
0:18:40,5 --> 0:18:46,51
would have buried Manhattah to a depth of 830 feet (250 m)


250
0:18:46,51 --> 0:18:50,85
But how an eruption on this small, remote island could cause climatic chaos


251
0:18:50,85 --> 0:18:57,75
thousands of miles away, remained a mystery


252
0:18:57,75 --> 0:19:1,18
The evidence that would link Laki with this worldwide catastrophe


253
0:19:1,18 --> 0:19:7,83
was locked inside these boulders


254
0:19:7,83 --> 0:19:11,33
The story is in the rocks. This rock here is part of


255
0:19:11,33 --> 0:19:15,3
the material, the magma that came out during the eruption


256
0:19:15,3 --> 0:19:18,53
These holes are cold bubbles,


257
0:19:18,53 --> 0:19:24,61
and they form as the magma raises from deep within the ground and approaches the surface


258
0:19:24,61 --> 0:19:26,37
and it really starts to boil!


259
0:19:26,37 --> 0:19:30,75
The gas, which is dissolved in the magma at depth, goes into the bubbles


260
0:19:30,75 --> 0:19:34,58
then it escapes into the atmosphere


261
0:19:34,58 --> 0:19:37,22
When this bubble rock erupted onto the surface


262
0:19:37,22 --> 0:19:44,49
it would have poured gas out into the Icelandic atmosphere


263
0:19:44,49 --> 0:19:52,41
Could this gas have caused climatic chaos across the globe?


264
0:19:52,41 --> 0:19:57,54
The identity of this gas can be found in the microscopic structure of the rock


265
0:19:57,54 --> 0:20:1,84
If you look closely at this rock, you can see a lot of white specks


266
0:20:1,84 --> 0:20:6,55
these little white specks are the crystals who grow in the magma at depth


267
0:20:6,55 --> 0:20:10,8
Sometimes this crystals, as they're growing, they would encapsulate


268
0:20:10,8 --> 0:20:14,49
pristine magma and bring it up to the surface


269
0:20:14,49 --> 0:20:20,23
Like time capsules, the white crystals contained untouched magma from deep in the earth


270
0:20:20,23 --> 0:20:25,4
locked away since 1783


271
0:20:25,4 --> 0:20:32,6
Dr. Thordarson has analysed this magma and found it to contain poisonous Sulphur Dioxide


272
0:20:32,6 --> 0:20:38,92
And because there was so much lava here, it would have released enormous amounts


273
0:20:38,92 --> 0:20:48,58
A staggering 100 million tons of Sulphur Dioxide gas was pumped into the atmosphere


274
0:20:48,58 --> 0:20:54,76
But how could gases released from Laki cause bitterly cold weather across the globe?


275
0:20:54,76 --> 0:21:2,67
The answer laid in accounts of a thick, red fog reported over Iceland in June 1783


276
0:21:2,67 --> 0:21:6,88
Within a few weeks it had been blown over London and Paris


277
0:21:6,88 --> 0:21:13,9
By July, it had dispersed across the entire northern hemisphere


278
0:21:13,9 --> 0:21:21,11
Scientists now know that the red fog was caused by the Sulphur Dioxide which rose high into the air


279
0:21:21,11 --> 0:21:26,82
Mixing with water, it created a Sulphuric Acid haze


280
0:21:26,82 --> 0:21:32,54
The haze blocked out the sun, and it sent temperatures plummeting


281
0:21:32,54 --> 0:21:37,53
As a result, the northern hemisphere endured 3 bitterly cold winters


282
0:21:37,53 --> 0:21:44,84
which brought spring floods, famine and widespread poverty to Europe


283
0:21:44,84 --> 0:21:48,79
Some historians have long believed that these climatic conditions


284
0:21:48,79 --> 0:21:56,55
triggered social and political unrest, which led to the French Revolution in 1789


285
0:21:56,55 --> 0:22:2,79
But scientists now suspect Laki had ramifications even further afield


286
0:22:2,79 --> 0:22:6,77
The cold temperatures in the north changed air currents in the south


287
0:22:6,77 --> 0:22:10,29
causing dramatic climate changes


288
0:22:10,29 --> 0:22:13,94
India was hit by a terrible drought


289
0:22:13,94 --> 0:22:20,97
People say that more than half a million people died from the drought in India


290
0:22:20,97 --> 0:22:26,64
Also, this change in atmospheric circulation caused a very cold summer in Japan


291
0:22:26,64 --> 0:22:28,33
It was cold and wet


292
0:22:28,33 --> 0:22:31,93
The rice harvest failed,


293
0:22:31,93 --> 0:22:36,51
and the result was the greatest famine in japanese history


294
0:22:36,51 --> 0:22:42,23
It is estimated that Laki killed over 2 million people worldwide,


295
0:22:42,23 --> 0:22:50,11
and was one of the most devastating volcanic eruptions in the history of mankind


296
0:22:50,11 --> 0:22:53,25
The evidence has proven that Iceland's recent volcanic history


297
0:22:53,25 --> 0:22:58,75
has had a devastating effect on the island and the rest of the world


298
0:22:58,75 --> 0:23:4,93
Enormous lava fields reveal that Laki was a gigantic eruption


299
0:23:4,93 --> 0:23:10,89
Bubbles in the rock indicate that huge volumes of gas were released from Laki


300
0:23:10,89 --> 0:23:16,3
The white crystals reveal that this gas was poisonous Sulphur Dioxide,


301
0:23:16,3 --> 0:23:24,22
evidence that Iceland's volcanoes caused climatic mayhem across the globe


302
0:23:24,22 --> 0:23:28,61
But eruptions like Laki may not be confined to the past


303
0:23:28,61 --> 0:23:32,39
Some believe that the balance between fire and ice is shifting,


304
0:23:32,39 --> 0:23:42,41
and has the potential to propel Iceland into another hell on earth


305
0:23:42,41 --> 0:23:49,7
The evidence is mounting, that Iceland has the potential to be the most lethal island on the planet


306
0:23:49,7 --> 0:23:54,55
A fearsome volcanic force lies beneath it, creating powerful volcanoes


307
0:23:54,55 --> 0:24:2,48
capable of generating gigantic lava flows and altering global climates


308
0:24:2,48 --> 0:24:6,23
Yet many of Iceland's volcanoes are covered in glaciers,


309
0:24:6,23 --> 0:24:11,49
fire and ice are held in a delicate balance


310
0:24:11,49 --> 0:24:15,23
Scientists fear if this balance were tipped the volcanoes favour,


311
0:24:15,23 --> 0:24:19,7
Iceland could become even deadlier


312
0:24:19,7 --> 0:24:22,28
If the remaining ice were to melt,


313
0:24:22,28 --> 0:24:28,64
what effect would it have on the activity of Iceland's volcanoes?


314
0:24:28,64 --> 0:24:36,41
The first clue in the investigation lies in these innocuous-looking piles of rock and rubble


315
0:24:36,41 --> 0:24:38,8
They're found all over Iceland,


316
0:24:38,8 --> 0:24:43,9
and yet this rocks don't come from a volcano


317
0:24:43,9 --> 0:24:44,4
They're Morraines:


318
0:24:44,4 --> 0:24:50,53
The geological term for rock piles deposited at the mouth of a glacier


319
0:24:50,53 --> 0:24:56,73
These deposits are evidence that the glaciers are shrinking


320
0:24:56,73 --> 0:25:0,98
Year by year, the glacier has melted and retreated back up the valley,


321
0:25:0,98 --> 0:25:9,25
leaving a Morraine like this behind


322
0:25:9,25 --> 0:25:13,22
Dr. Roberts has studied the Vatnajökull glacier for the last ten years


323
0:25:13,22 --> 0:25:16,42
and has noticed this dramatic trend


324
0:25:16,42 --> 0:25:20,59
The glacier is retreating at a remarkable rate since I've been visiting the area


325
0:25:20,59 --> 0:25:24,5
I've seen tremendous changes. The ice has retreated annually at a rate of about


326
0:25:24,5 --> 0:25:30,31
200 feet (61 m) per year. This lake over here used to be filled with ice


327
0:25:30,31 --> 0:25:32,88
I've seen the ice progressively melt, this morraine has formed,


328
0:25:32,88 --> 0:25:36,38
this whole valley has become almost bare


329
0:25:36,38 --> 0:25:42,38
Maybe in the next 20 years this whole glacier will disappear and a lake will form in that valley


330
0:25:42,38 --> 0:25:47,9
Iceland's glaciers are melting at an unprecedented rate


331
0:25:47,9 --> 0:25:51,59
With 5% of Iceland's ice caps melting in the last 40 years,


332
0:25:51,59 --> 0:25:54,97
the question that scientists are keen to understand


333
0:25:54,97 --> 0:26:2,31
is: What effect this rapid melting will have on the volcanoes that lie beneath?


334
0:26:2,31 --> 0:26:5,21
The only other time that glaciers have melted this quickly


335
0:26:5,21 --> 0:26:10,58
is when Iceland came out of the last Ice Age


336
0:26:10,58 --> 0:26:16,63
But what can past events tell us about the future?


337
0:26:16,63 --> 0:26:21,96
Geologist professor Bill McGuire is investigating how volcanic activity changed


338
0:26:21,96 --> 0:26:24,59
at the end of the last Ice Age


339
0:26:24,59 --> 0:26:29,3
And he's unearthed some surprising results


340
0:26:29,3 --> 0:26:34,3
Around about 11 or 12 thousand years ago you started to see quite rapid melting of glaciers


341
0:26:34,3 --> 0:26:35,66
in Iceland and elsewhere


342
0:26:35,66 --> 0:26:39,59
And that triggered a recognisable increase of volcanic activity,


343
0:26:39,59 --> 0:26:43,61
because you were removing this large mass of ice very, very quickly


344
0:26:43,61 --> 0:26:48,2
The rapid melting of ice kick-starts volcanic eruptions beneath


345
0:26:48,2 --> 0:26:51,76
Volcanic eruptions are triggered by the gas in the magma,


346
0:26:51,76 --> 0:26:54,83
which expands to form bubbles and the bubbles drive the eruption


347
0:26:54,83 --> 0:26:58,57
It's rather like taking the cork out of a bottle of champagne


348
0:26:58,57 --> 0:27:2,9
Now, if you have a very heavy weight on top of a volcano,


349
0:27:2,9 --> 0:27:4,19
if it's a heavy mass of water or ice,


350
0:27:4,19 --> 0:27:8,64
that can help supress eruptive activity


351
0:27:8,64 --> 0:27:13,21
But when ice melts quickly, this downward pressure is suddenly released


352
0:27:13,21 --> 0:27:17,5
and that's when the trouble starts


353
0:27:17,5 --> 0:27:20,74
As the ice melts, so the pressure on the magma underneath is reduced,


354
0:27:20,74 --> 0:27:25,9
the gas in the magma can form bubbles, they can coalesce and they can eventually


355
0:27:25,9 --> 0:27:27,96
drive the magma upwards towards the surface and trigger


356
0:27:27,96 --> 0:27:35,91
other explosive eruptions or effusions of lava that are spared out at a huge distances


357
0:27:35,91 --> 0:27:39,36
Iceland's glaciers are melting rapidly


358
0:27:39,36 --> 0:27:44,45
This has led scientists to believe that a devastating eruption on the scale of Laki


359
0:27:44,45 --> 0:27:46,5
could happen again


360
0:27:46,5 --> 0:27:49,94
The question is WHEN? These are things that we have to think about


361
0:27:49,94 --> 0:27:55,55
and try to prepare ourselves to deal with if they happen in our lifetime


362
0:27:55,55 --> 0:28:1,24
Is it possible that we can get another eruption like this in Iceland?


363
0:28:1,24 --> 0:28:3,89
Definetely


364
0:28:3,89 --> 0:28:12,57
The investigation has revealed how the vast and voilent island of Iceland was formed


365
0:28:12,57 --> 0:28:16,84
Cracks in the Thingvellir plane and traces of chemicals in the rocks


366
0:28:16,84 --> 0:28:26,66
revealed how the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and Hot Spot joined forces to create a collossal volcanic force


367
0:28:26,66 --> 0:28:30,6
Massive fissure eruptions ripped the land open


368
0:28:30,6 --> 0:28:36,51
Hemorrhaging millions of tons of lava, Iceland rapidly formed


369
0:28:36,51 --> 0:28:41,6
Deep northern fjords were evidence that a giant ice sheet eroded the land 


370
0:28:41,6 --> 0:28:49,19
and entombed the volcanoes, locking fire and ice in a titanic battle


371
0:28:49,19 --> 0:28:55,13
Boulders strewn in an ancient valley reveal how fire emerged victorious


372
0:28:55,13 --> 0:28:58,88
unleashing cataclysmic floods


373
0:28:58,88 --> 0:29:3,8
And specks of Sulphur in the rocks showed how Iceland's volcanoes


374
0:29:3,8 --> 0:29:7,97
have the potential to cause global destruction


375
0:29:7,97 --> 0:29:12,46
Now, glaciers melting above some of the world's most deadly volcanoes


376
0:29:12,46 --> 0:29:19,91
are increasing the threat of future eruptions


377
0:29:19,91 --> 0:29:24,19
Over the last 20 million years, Iceland's almighty volcanic force


378
0:29:24,19 --> 0:29:29,8
has created a vast, alien landscape
