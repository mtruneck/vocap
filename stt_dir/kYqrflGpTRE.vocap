###11 SUROOSH ALVI: It's late.
###12 We're deep in the heart of it now.
###16 I don't know how much water we have.
###18 We haven't eaten in a really long time.
###20 And my glasses are fogging up because it's so hot.
###24 And I can't see.
###25 And I'm walking in the mud.
###28 I don't know, man.
###30 I think this might be the stupidest
###30 thing I've ever done.
###32 
###45 The Democratic Republic of Congo.
###47 It's one of the poorest countries in the world, and
###49 thanks to insanely complicated mix of politics, armed
###53 conflict, and corruption, it's also one of the most
###55 under-reported.
###57 It also happens to be home to a nondescript black rock known
###61 as coltan, a vital ingredient in the production of nearly
###64 every cell phone and computer on the planet.
###67 Without coltan, our technology-driven lives would
###70 come to a screeching halt.
###72 And Congo has 80% of the world's supply.
###76 
###82 Congo also has cassiterite, gold, and a slew of other
###85 minerals that make the world go round.
###87 
###90 Now, you'd think that having so much of the stuff would be
###92 good for Congo, but the reality is far from the case.
###95 There's a reason they're called conflict minerals.
###98 [SHOUTING]
###101 SUROOSH ALVI: Since the mid 1990s, armed groups have used
###104 these minerals to fund a series of fantastically
###106 complicated and horrifically violent wars.
###109 MALE SPEAKER: We have to kill them.
###110 We have to kill them.
###112 SUROOSH ALVI: And as the tech boom drove up the price of
###114 these minerals, violence skyrocketed.
###116 
###123 Slaves to technology that we are, we had see for ourselves
###126 where these minerals were coming from and what these
###129 rebels were fighting for.
###130 MALE SPEAKERS: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###133 SUROOSH ALVI: So together with my cameraman Jake and producer
###136 Jason, we hopped on a plane and flew to Congo.
###139 
###146 Our first stop was Kinshasa.
###147 
###156 To say that Congo's natural resources have been more of a
###158 curse than a blessing would be an understatement.
###161 Conrad described this place as "the vilest scramble for loot
###164 that has ever disfigured the human conscience." That was
###167 written in the 1800s, right around the time that Belgian
###170 colonists were stripping the country of its rich supply of
###173 ivory and rubber, killing nearly half the population in
###176 the process.
###178 In the 1960s, it was the United States that was after
###181 Congo's cobalt for its Cold War fighter jets, leading to
###184 its support for a dictator who renamed the country Zaire and
###188 embezzled billions of dollars.
###190 MOBUTO SESE SEKO: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###191 
###195 SUROOSH ALVI: Today, it's the global demand for technology
###198 that is inadvertently fueling the conflict in Congo.
###202 The statistics we read are staggering.
###204 Five million people have died in the Congo because of this
###208 conflict since the mid '90s until about 2007.
###212 It's a huge number.
###213 The most since any war since World War II.
###217 The government in Kinshasa says that the war is over, but
###220 Kinshasa is a long way from the jungles of eastern Congo,
###223 where most of the rebel groups and the minerals that finance
###225 them are located.
###227 So we needed to go east to find out what was
###229 really going on.
###230 
###233 One thing that had been drilled into our heads before
###234 we came to Congo was that you do not fly
###236 on Congolese airlines.
###238 This is a country whose aircraft are banned from
###240 European airspace.
###242 Last year, a crash that killed 20 people was the result of a
###245 crocodile escaping from a passenger's carry on luggage.
###250 But with Goma being over 1,000 miles away, we didn't have
###252 much of a choice.
###254 
###255 And as it turned out, that flight would be the most
###257 comfortable experience of the days to come.
###259 
###271 One thing we've noticed since we came here is that there are
###273 fires burning everywhere in Congo.
###275 I guess they're just burning their garbage.
###277 But it kind of feels apocalyptic at times.
###280 Watch out.
###281 
###296 We're in Goma.
###297 It's in eastern Congo, right on the Rwandan border.
###301 This has been the epicenter of the conflict since 1994.
###304 It's also the center for humanitarian aid.
###306 There are 51 different international organizations
###308 based here.
###309 As you can see, there's UN guys everywhere around us.
###313 It's kind of chaotic.
###316 We're also pretty close to the mines where coltan is
###319 extracted from, and we're going to go check that out.
###323 When we got to Goma, we met up with Tim Freccia, a veteran
###326 crisis and conflict photographer who has worked in
###328 Congo for years.
###330 He told us that we were under-dressed for our trip to
###332 the cold mountain mining town of Numbi, so we went shopping.
###336 I've got a nice polo here.
###339 I got a Minnesota Golden Gophers hoodie.
###342 Jake got a great Carhartt.
###344 But I think this might be a strong look when I'm going to
###348 interview the militia.
###349 Some Wu wear.
###349 The only problem is it's fucking disgusting.
###352 Is it pretty good?
###353 MALE SPEAKER: Yeah.
###354 SUROOSH ALVI: Yeah, you like it?
###355 MALE SPEAKER: I like it.
###356 SUROOSH ALVI: He likes it.
###356 We got our outfits.
###358 
###381 So we're going to visit the mines today, the Numbi mines.
###385 It's where they extract coltan from.
###387 HOREB BUJAMBO: And cassiterite and tourmaline, and some other
###390 precious stones.
###392 SUROOSH ALVI: This is Horeb.
###392 He's our new buddy.
###393 He's our new best friend.
###395 He knows everyone.
###396 He's a bit of a celebrity in these parts.
###399 HOREB BUJAMBO: [SPEAKING FRENCH]
###404 SUROOSH ALVI: He's got a TV show.
###405 What's your show called?
###406 HOREB BUJAMBO: Monusco Realites.
###408 It's a kind of Congo reality.
###410 SUROOSH ALVI: Is it safe to say that you're a Congolese
###412 reality TV star?
###414 HOREB BUJAMBO: I'm a celebrity for many Congolese, just
###415 because I tell them the stories which they--
###417 SUROOSH ALVI: They don't know.
###418 HOREB BUJAMBO: They don't know.
###419 I tell stories about Congo.
###420 
###434 SUROOSH ALVI: I've driven a lot of treacherous roads
###436 before, but this one seems to be the worst.
###439 HOREB BUJAMBO: We are still going up.
###441 Up and up.
###441 SUROOSH ALVI: Oh my god, I can't even look right now.
###444 This is completely fucked.
###446 HOREB BUJAMBO: Yeah, Yeah.
###447 I saw vehicles, they went down.
###450 SUROOSH ALVI: Fall down the hill?
###452 HOREB BUJAMBO: It's not a safe road, yeah.
###453 SUROOSH ALVI: We figured that out.
###454 HOREB BUJAMBO: Despite the beauty of this place.
###455 SUROOSH ALVI: Yeah, it's beautiful.
###456 HOREB BUJAMBO: Yeah.
###458 
###468 SUROOSH ALVI: What if we all just push him out?
###471 Straight out?
###472 Nothing's working this way.
###473 He's not getting anywhere.
###476 MALE SPEAKERS: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###478 
###486 SUROOSH ALVI: Where did all these people appear from?
###487 Like, we're in the middle of nowhere.
###488 
###491 I thought you were kidding when you said
###493 hiring local labor.
###495 They just conveniently had a shovel, as well.
###497 
###500 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###504 SUROOSH ALVI: Like, as soon as we sank into the mud hole, the
###507 kids were all like, thumbs up, we got him.
###510 Now they're all here, and they're going to work until
###513 they get us out, and they're gonna get paid.
###516 MALE SPEAKERS: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###518 
###524 SUROOSH ALVI: Yes, yes.
###526 We finally got out.
###527 But before long, we got stuck again.
###530 And again.
###533 And again.
###535 Until one thing became very clear.
###537 We were not making it back to Goma anytime soon.
###540 It looks like we're probably going to end up sleeping at
###542 the mines tonight, which is a bit odd.
###547 I can't believe connecting two land cruisers
###550 with seatbelts worked.
###553 They're saying we have to hurry because it's going to
###555 rain again soon, and if we don't get past this patch of
###560 red earth, we're going to be stuck sleeping here.
###564 
###580 When we finally got to Numbi, we had to smooth talk the
###583 local officials into showing us the mines.
###585 So these are all the powerful dudes of the town.
###589 Yet another negotiation.
###590 Bonjour, Suroosh.
###592 MALE SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].
###593 SUROOSH ALVI: Nice to meet you.
###595 [FRENCH].
###597 This way.
###598 In what would become a running theme for the rest of our
###601 trip, the locals said the mines were just over there
###603 around the bend.
###605 And then we would get over there and around the bend,
###607 they were just over there, and over the hill.
###611 Like a quick two kilometers.
###613 Holy fuck.
###615 
###621 I'm about to pass out, Jake.
###625 Hey Jake, how many people are working?
###627 JAKE BURGHART: None.
###628 SUROOSH ALVI: Really?
###629 JAKE BURGHART: They've all gone home.
###630 We have to come back tomorrow.
###632 SUROOSH ALVI: The mine had no miners.
###634 It was completely empty.
###636 The locals told us that this mine in particular is owned by
###639 a member of Congo Senate who lives in Kinshasa, and that
###642 his miners pull 15 kilos of coltan out of it every day.
###646 At $30 a kilo, that's about $13,000 a month, a lot of
###650 money in a country where most of the people survive on less
###653 than $1 a day.
###655 And while the senator gets the big rocks, the bottom feeders
###659 get by on what washes down the stream.
###661 
###663 So we got totally set up.
###665 Basically when we pulled into town.
###667 MALE SPEAKER: Lower, lower, lower your voice.
###669 SUROOSH ALVI: Basically we got totally set up.
###670 When we pulled into town, alarm bells went off.
###673 And they said yeah, we'll show you a mine, and they took us
###675 on a trek far, far away from town to a mine where they sent
###680 in advance someone ahead of us to clear everyone out because
###684 there were kids working in the mine.
###685 Then we got there, and they're like, oh, yeah, everybody's
###687 just gone home for the day.
###688 They actually fessed up to that to Horeb, to our guy, so,
###692 I'm still pissed off.
###693 
###696 It's gonna be an interesting night.
###698 
###709 Probably about 5:30 in the morning here in the Numbi
###713 mining town.
###716 This is a town with no electricity,
###718 with no running water.
###720 We basically got stranded out here, which wasn't really part
###723 of the plan.
###724 They didn't take too kindly to us initially, but they were
###727 even worried about our safety, because we're in South Kivu,
###730 and they're not used to this kind of thing.
###732 A bunch of foreigners spending a night here.
###735 They gave us this little house to stay in.
###737 Then they offered us a couple soldiers to guard
###740 us all night long.
###741 You know, yesterday we experienced them trying to
###745 keep some secrets hidden.
###747 So today we have a plan.
###748 We're going to break free.
###749 We're going to go a couple kilometers, and we're going to
###751 set up and wait for the miners to show up so we can really
###754 see how these mines operate.
###755 
###759 This is the main street of the Numbi mining town.
###763 It's very muddy today, after raining all night.
###766 It reeks of urine.
###768 Here's my breakfast, along with two Advils and some kind
###772 of mega antibiotic cure all.
###775 When anything goes wrong in Africa, you take that pill.
###778 Plugs up your ass, reduces fever.
###782 Well, so much for getting a head start on everyone.
###784 
###793 Oh, shit.
###794 Jason, Jason, come here.
###796 
###798 I think it's like, quicksand.
###799 
###802 I just kept going down.
###804 This is not going to be fun.
###806 
###822 This is the main Numbi mine.
###823 Just got there.
###825 These houses are all miners who work right here.
###829 
###848 It took two days of trekking and looking.
###851 We're finally here in the heart of the mine.
###852 
###860 This is where all kinds of minerals are coming out of,
###863 everything from tantalum to coltan.
###867 MALE SPEAKER: This is what you call tourmaline.
###869 I can show you one that is the biggest one.
###871 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE].
###873 They say that this is the most expensive.
###877 This is where they get it.
###879 You can see that this man is fortunate, because he got this
###883 block of stone, which has everything.
###884 SUROOSH ALVI: A lot inside.
###885 MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, it has a lot inside.
###887 SUROOSH ALVI: It seems so primitive, with their bare
###890 hands, and with shovels.
###891 They're pulling it out, and a lot of it ends up in super
###895 high tech devices.
###896 And you never think when you're using those devices
###900 back home, that this is how it actually starts.
###903 And that without this process, it wouldn't exist, or it
###906 wouldn't work.
###907 The mine that we finally saw was so different from the
###909 horror stories that we had heard.
###911 We were expecting to see forced child labor, inhumane
###914 conditions, and rebels everywhere.
###915 
###919 Maybe things were changing in eastern Congo, or at least
###921 that's how this mine made it seem.
###923 In recent years, activist organizations in the US and
###926 Europe have been pressuring electronics companies into
###929 taking greater responsibility for keeping rebels out of
###931 their supply chain.
###932 And in 2010, the US Congress passed legislation forcing
###936 companies to declare their use of conflict minerals.
###940 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###942 
###955 SUROOSH ALVI: And who gets the credit for this change?
###958 Is it the government in Kinshasha?
###960 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###961 
###972 SUROOSH ALVI: Why did the government want
###974 to make these changes?
###975 Was it because of the pressure of western corporations and
###979 governments?
###980 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###982 
###997 SUROOSH ALVI: Things seemed so peaceful that it was hard to
###999 imagine that there was ever a war here.
###1002 Everything that we've been walking on, during the like,
###1005 second Congolese war, this was like a battlefield.
###1009 The mine was an almost picture perfect symbol of progress,
###1012 but I couldn't help but wonder how long it would be before a
###1015 bunch of guys showed up with guns and screwed it all up.
###1018 TIM FRECCIA: That's the whole point with conflict minerals
###1020 is it's in every businessman's interest to
###1025 keep conflict going.
###1026 Then there's no control, there's no government.
###1029 There's nobody watching whether or not
###1030 children are working.
###1032 
###1036 SUROOSH ALVI: Our last stop in Numbi was the
###1038 coltan storage facility.
###1039 And not surprisingly, it was the nicest building in town.
###1042 
###1048 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1052 SUROOSH ALVI: Let me see?
###1053 
###1059 Wow.
###1060 This is coltan.
###1062 This is what it's all about.
###1063 80% of the world's supply comes from here in Congo.
###1067 Thank you, Congo, for providing this for us.
###1070 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1072 SUROOSH ALVI: And that's cassarite.
###1073 Is it pure, solid cassarite?
###1076 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1077 SUROOSH ALVI: And this is basically what tin, tin ore
###1080 comes from.
###1081 MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, it's heavy.
###1082 SUROOSH ALVI: It's heavy.
###1084 We struggled for two days to find the mines, and eventually
###1087 we got there.
###1090 We are going back to Goma on motorcycles because roads are
###1093 so bad now, and so dangerous that they're saying that a
###1095 Land Cruiser almost fell off a cliff last night.
###1097 
###1100 We'd seen one of the mines where coltan comes from.
###1103 We're happy that the conditions there seem to be
###1105 improving, but with so many armed groups operating in
###1108 eastern Congo, that could change in an instant.
###1111 But where did all these rebels come from in the first place?
###1114 
###1123 Most people know about the Rwandan genocide.
###1126 Hutus killing Tutsis.
###1127 But few understand how it led to a war in neighboring Congo.
###1131 Here's the short version.
###1133 Millions of Rwandan refugees streaming across the border.
###1136 Among them, many of the Hutu soldiers
###1139 involved in the genocide.
###1141 Soldiers that the new Tutsi leadership in
###1143 Rwanda wanted dead.
###1145 Before long, eastern Congo became home to a litany of
###1148 armed militias supported by foreign countries.
###1150 
###1158 We're on our way to meet the Mai Mai.
###1160 They are a witch doctor militia and self-proclaimed
###1163 protectors of Congolese soil.
###1166 They are the most feared militia in the country.
###1170 It is believed they have special powers.
###1172 They can fly, they can disappear.
###1175 And bullets pass through them like water.
###1178 And we're going to go camping with them.
###1181 Most of the groups who have been using minerals to fuel
###1183 their military operations have been from the countries
###1186 surrounding Congo.
###1187 The Mai Mai are a sort of patriotic response to this
###1190 influx of foreigners, and they are the all too often
###1193 overlooked link in the vicious circle that is conflict in
###1196 eastern Congo.
###1197 As long as they're convinced that Congo is being corrupted
###1199 by outsiders, they will keep fighting.
###1201 
###1220 [CAR HONKING]
###1223 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1225 
###1230 SUROOSH ALVI: So we left Goma three hours ago, and on our
###1233 drive here, again, beautiful.
###1236 Eastern Congo is stunning.
###1237 But as we approached Masisi territory in this town that
###1241 we're in now, things were getting worse.
###1243 
###1248 More humanitarian aid vehicles everywhere.
###1250 
###1253 Everybody here needs help.
###1254 The locals, they're dirt poor, and they're hungry.
###1257 
###1260 Horeb is going to talk to people to sort shit out.
###1264 Make sure we don't get into any trouble as we proceed.
###1266 The Mai Mai agreed to let us into their world, which we're
###1271 really excited to see.
###1273 MULTIPLE SPEAKERS: Chuck Norris.
###1274 Chuck Norris.
###1278 JAKE BURGHART: This is the second time people have
###1279 thought I was Chuck Norris.
###1280 MALE SPEAKER: Yeah?
###1280 JAKE BURGHART: I didn't even have a headband on.
###1282 
###1288 SUROOSH ALVI: So what's happening?
###1288 We're waiting for the motorcycles?
###1290 HOREB BUJAMBO: We are still bargaining about the price for
###1291 the motorcycles.
###1292 Going to that area is not easy.
###1294 It's something like going to a war zone.
###1298 People here are saying that the last time when they went
###1300 there, they were beaten by Mai Mai when they
###1302 took some people there.
###1304 Then they're asking us to guarantee that when they spend
###1306 the night there, if we shall assure that nobody will beat
###1312 them, and nobody will traumatize them.
###1314 SUROOSH ALVI: The further we got from Masisi, the reality
###1317 of the situation we were heading into began to sink in.
###1321 The various rebel groups that still occupy much of the bush
###1325 are packs of battle-hardened, murderous thugs, whose names
###1328 have become synonymous with the word rape.
###1331 FEMALE SPEAKER 1: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1332 
###1356 SUROOSH ALVI: And the most notorious rebel group
###1358 operating in Congo today is the FDLR, a Hutu power group
###1363 tied to the perpetrators of the Rwandan genocide.
###1366 FEMALE SPEAKER 2: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1367 
###1389 SUROOSH ALVI: So this is where the road ends.
###1392 Now we wait for some motorcycles.
###1395 We sat around waiting at a nearby UN post for the
###1397 motorcycle guys we hired to arrive.
###1400 Yeah, the same guys that were harassing us when
###1402 we arrived in Masisi.
###1403 
###1412 We got six kilometers from the point where the road ends for
###1417 the car, and we're waiting for the motorcycles.
###1418 Our motorcycles aren't coming, or they're not here yet.
###1422 And this is the UN base in the area.
###1424 We had to register with them, which kind of
###1428 makes me a bit nervous.
###1429 They say it's just a formality in case something happens.
###1433 The Congolese government doesn't really have any
###1436 jurisdiction where we're going.
###1438 So you turn the phone on for 15 minutes.
###1440 UN OFFICER: Only 15.
###1441 SUROOSH ALVI: OK.
###1441 UN OFFICER: That is only for you.
###1443 SUROOSH ALVI: In the evening, and in the morning.
###1444 6:00 and 6:00.
###1445 UN OFFICER: No.
###1445 Only--
###1446 SUROOSH ALVI: Only once.
###1446 UN OFFICER: Only 15 minutes.
###1448 SUROOSH ALVI: In 24 hours.
###1449 OK.
###1449 I understand.
###1450 Thank you.
###1450 JAKE BURGHART: Thank you.
###1451 UN OFFICER: We are not using this line.
###1453 We have radio sets.
###1453 We are specially open for you.
###1455 SUROOSH ALVI: OK.
###1455 UN OFFICER: For 15 minutes.
###1456 If you have some mess, you can talk.
###1459 SUROOSH ALVI: OK.
###1459 Thank you.
###1460 And then we were standing there, and I just thought, we
###1463 should just ask them if we can sleep here, because I don't
###1465 like the idea of if our motorcycle guys show up, we go
###1469 six kilometers with them, and then it's going to get dark,
###1472 it's going to rain, and we're gong to be wandering through
###1474 the Congolese jungle in the dark, trying to
###1478 find the Mai Mai.
###1479 Sounds a bit sketchy to me.
###1481 Just as I was getting comfortable, the motorcycles
###1483 guys arrived, and we were off, racing to get to the Mai Mai
###1486 camp before dark.
###1488 
###1495 As we were riding deeper into the jungle, we got stopped by
###1498 a bunch of young guys with guns.
###1501 We'd been told that the Congolese military, the FARDC,
###1504 were a little rough around the edges.
###1506 But there was something about these guys
###1507 that made us nervous.
###1509 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1510 
###1520 SUROOSH ALVI: And that's when Horeb whispered to us that
###1522 these guys were the dreaded Rwandan Hutu rebels, the FDLR.
###1526 Basically, the last people in the world we
###1528 wanted to run into.
###1529 HOREB BUJAMBO: I knew that these people we met on the way
###1532 were Rwandans and not Mai Mai just because they were
###1536 speaking in Kinyarwandan, and this is what the
###1538 Mai Mai don't do.
###1539 [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1541 
###1555 MALE SPEAKER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1556 
###1560 HOREB BUJAMBO: This is what people know about the FDLR.
###1562 If you don't cooperate or so, you can pay your life.
###1567 SUROOSH ALVI: We'd heard rumors that for some reason,
###1569 the Mai Mai and the FDLR were working together, but it
###1572 wasn't until the creepy commander of their outpost
###1574 gave us four of his armed guards to take us to the Mai
###1576 Mai camp that we actually believed it.
###1579 So we continued our journey through the jungle at night.
###1582 
###1589 You see anything?
###1592 I don't know how far we are from the final destination,
###1596 the Mai Mai camp, but it's late.
###1599 We're deep in the heart of it now.
###1602 I don't know, man.
###1604 I think this might be the stupidest
###1605 thing I've ever done.
###1606 
###1611 How far are we?
###1612 
###1623 We arrived here 14 hours after we left Vilma this morning.
###1628 The last three hours of which was walking through the jungle
###1631 in the dark, which is a first for me.
###1636 I'm not afraid to say it, I am soft, living in New York City,
###1641 sitting at my desk 12 hours a day.
###1642 I'm a professional emailer, just [TYPING SOUNDS].
###1646 I wanted to stay with the Indian UN guys, because their
###1650 place was great.
###1652 Because I knew there was no way we were going to get there
###1654 in 90 minutes, and I knew we were going to end up walking
###1657 through a Congolese jungle at night.
###1660 And it sucked, but we're here.
###1661 
###1673 MALE SPEAKERS: [SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1684 SUROOSH ALVI: We're in the Mai Mai camp right now.
###1686 We are way off the grid, deep in the bush.
###1690 We're so far out here that the UN jurisdiction ended, and
###1694 then the Congolese government troops, the FARDC, their
###1699 jurisdiction ended.
###1700 We encountered some Rwandan rebels going
###1702 through that area.
###1703 And after that, it's just bush.
###1705 But hopefully we're gonna meet the general now.
###1707 We want to interview him and get an understanding of why
###1709 they're the most political and feared
###1711 militia in this country.
###1714 It would be great if we could see the special
###1715 powers that they have.
###1718 I want to see them turn themselves into animals.
###1719 I think that would be pretty cool.
###1721 All right.
###1724 I need Imodium.
###1726 MALE SPEAKERS: [SINGING IN FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1733 SUROOSH ALVI: The term Mai Mai is shorthand for the wide
###1736 assortment of local militias in Eastern Congo.
###1739 General Janvier is the leader of a group known as the
###1741 Patriotic Alliance for a Free and Sovereign Congo, also
###1744 known as the APCLS.
###1746 The thing about rebel leaders is that much of their power
###1748 lies in their mystique.
###1749 They don't want to seem overeager to meet the press.
###1753 So we had a wait around until the general could carve some
###1755 time out of his busy schedule to meet with us.
###1758 MALE SPEAKER: He looks like Chuck Norris.
###1759 
###1763 SUROOSH ALVI: In the meantime, we hung out
###1765 with some of his soldiers.
###1766 
###1773 Horeb, how many times has he been shot?
###1775 HOREB BUJAMBO: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1778 APCLS SOLDIER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1779 
###1783 SUROOSH ALVI: Who was he fighting when he was shot?
###1785 APCLS SOLDIER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1788 HOREB BUJAMBO: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1789 APCLS SOLDIER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1789 HOREB BUJAMBO: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1791 APCLS SOLDIER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1792 SUROOSH ALVI: When they say Tutsis, it's shorthand for the
###1794 Rwandan government, who they blame for
###1796 most of Congo's problems.
###1798 HOREB BUJAMBO: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1800 
###1805 APCLS SOLDIER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1807 
###1810 SUROOSH ALVI: Does he have a name, the dog?
###1812 HOREB BUJAMBO: Bobby.
###1812 SUROOSH ALVI: Bobby.
###1814 HOREB BUJAMBO: They say that Bobby has also battled and
###1817 contributed to many fighting.
###1819 SUROOSH ALVI: Really?
###1820 But he looks so nice.
###1822 He just winked at me.
###1826 MALE SPEAKERS: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1828 
###1833 SUROOSH ALVI: Just as our friend was ordered to stop
###1834 speaking, we received word that the general was finally
###1837 ready to see us.
###1838 But in order to do so, we had to cross one of the sketchiest
###1841 Lord of the Flies- esque bridges imaginable.
###1844 Then we were led to an even more remote encampment.
###1847 Then, after being surrounded by heavily armed guards, we
###1850 met with the general's secretary, who meticulously
###1853 transcribed our every word.
###1854 The general finally granted us an audience.
###1857 We can start?
###1857 HOREB BUJAMBO: Yeah.
###1858 SUROOSH ALVI: OK, monsieur le general, thank
###1859 you for your time.
###1861 My first question is, since the time of Belgian
###1865 colonization, the natural resources of this country have
###1868 been taken from the Congolese people.
###1871 As the protectors of Congolese soil, what is your view on the
###1877 mining that's taken place in the country and the way
###1880 foreign corporations and governments are
###1882 involved with that?
###1883 
###1885 GENERAL JANVIER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1886 
###1924 SUROOSH ALVI: It seemed like Janvier's beef was not with
###1926 foreigners in general, but with the current
###1928 government of Rwanda.
###1929 So I was starting to understand why they'd team up
###1931 with the FDLR.
###1932 It seems to me that you have a common enemy with the FDLR,
###1937 and I'm wondering, are you friends with them?
###1939 And also, do you think that they should leave this
###1943 country, along with the rest of the Rwandans?
###1945 GENERAL JANVIER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1946 
###1953 SUROOSH ALVI: Now I was totally confused.
###1955 Were they or weren't they allied with the FDLR?
###1957 The UN group of experts report that you and your group have
###1961 been working with FDLR, and it's very important for us to
###1966 get clarity on this from you, so we
###1967 communicate this report correctly.
###1969 GENERAL JANVIER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###1971 
###1994 SUROOSH ALVI: Even though I knew this was total bullshit,
###1996 because it was the FDLR who escorted us to the Mai Mai
###1998 camp, I didn't want to piss off our new friends, so I
###2001 decided to change topics.
###2002 Could you explain to me what some of these special powers
###2005 are that the Mai Mai have?
###2007 GENERAL JANVIER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###2009 
###2028 SUROOSH ALVI: I am a Muzungu, but I am not white.
###2033 And I believe in God.
###2036 GENERAL JANVIER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###2037 
###2063 SUROOSH ALVI: So the general wouldn't show off his magical
###2065 powers, but what he did insist on showing us were his
###2067 prisoners, two FARDC soldiers they kidnapped two months ago
###2071 while patrolling the area.
###2072 This was a remarkably weird, unsettling, and Heart of
###2075 Darkness moment.
###2077 It seems that they're pretty healthy, and haven't been
###2080 abused or beaten.
###2083 So why are you being nice to them?
###2085 GENERAL JANVIER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###2086 
###2097 SUROOSH ALVI: After the general served up his
###2098 propaganda, he fed us a nice, hot meal of
###2100 Congolese rice and beans.
###2103 It's the first meal we've had in a few days.
###2106 We're about to trek through the jungle.
###2109 This time in the middle of the afternoon, so I
###2111 expect it will be hot.
###2113 Took us 14 hours to get here.
###2115 Hopefully it won't take that long to get back.
###2117 
###2120 He was a nice guy, the general.
###2121 
###2126 On our trek back, we managed to piss off
###2128 the creepy FDLR commander.
###2130 FDLR COMMANDER: [SPEAKING FOREIGN LANGUAGE]
###2132 
###2136 SUROOSH ALVI: Got extorted by our motorcycle guys.
###2138 What happened?
###2139 JASON MOJICA: Well, they're holding out for like, a whole
###2141 lot more money.
###2142 SUROOSH ALVI: The UN guys are gonna get involved.
###2146 And had our lives threatened by a bunch of locals
###2148 drunk on 12% beer.
###2151 But the strangest part of it all was that by this point,
###2154 after just one week in the Congo, all this lunacy seemed
###2157 completely normal.
###2159 
###2166 Leaving tomorrow.
###2167 The trip has come to an end.
###2168 It was good vibes, it was scary at times.
###2172 We learned a lot.
###2173 We had to work hard to get to the story.
###2177 Whether we were going to the mines in Numbi, or whether we
###2180 were trying to meet with General Janvier.
###2182 It's an incredibly complicated situation in place.
###2186 There are no easy answers.
###2189 But we--
###2191 well, how do I end that?
###2191 There are no easy answers.
###2193 It's easy to pin the country's problems on the past.
###2196 On the legacy of brutality by Belgian colonialists and
###2199 kleptocratic rulers, the practices of Western
###2202 corporations, or wars with neighboring nations.
###2205 But that doesn't make any of them go away.
###2208 If we demanded conflict-free electronics, maybe the rebel
###2211 groups would simply melt away into the jungle.
###2214 Or maybe it would lead to businesses avoiding coltan
###2216 from Congo altogether, making one of the poorest countries
###2219 in the world even poorer, which is kind of what seems to
###2222 be happening.
###2224 Congo is one of the most under-reported stories in the
###2226 world, and now we understand why.
###2228 It's so insanely complicated that's it's hard to
###2230 know where to start.
###2232 We did, however, see some signs of hope and progress.
###2235 But it's a fragile progress in a place where anyone with a
###2238 gun and an agenda can basically have
###2241 his own little kingdom.
###2243 So until the government in Kinshasa takes control of its
###2246 territory and ensures that its army is the only one operating
###2249 in the jungle, Congo will continue to be a war zone.
###2253 And instead of being a blessing, the minerals that
###2256 fuel this conflict will continue to be a curse.
###2258
