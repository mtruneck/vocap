0:0:25,74 --> 0:0:29,68
Out near the orbit of Jupiter, a faint speck
of light is moving through the black of space. 


2
0:0:29,68 --> 0:0:35,36
At first glance it doesn't look like much,
no brighter than a thousand distant stars


3
0:0:35,36 --> 0:0:41,1
speckling the velvet sky behind it; indeed,
it takes a big telescope make out that it


4
0:0:41,1 --> 0:0:41,97
is a comet.


5
0:0:41,97 --> 0:0:44,3
But what a comet it could turn out to be…


6
0:0:44,3 --> 0:0:50,1
Later this year, “Comet ISON” could blossom
into a striking naked eye object visible even


7
0:0:50,1 --> 0:0:50,85
in broad daylight.  


8
0:0:50,85 --> 0:0:57,44
“Comet ISON is a sun grazer,” explains
Karl Battams of the Naval Research Lab. “The


9
0:0:57,44 --> 0:1:1,69
orbit of the comet will bring it very close
to the sun, which we know can be a spectacular


10
0:1:1,69 --> 0:1:3,309
thing.”


11
0:1:3,309 --> 0:1:9,67
Russian astronomers Vitali Nevski and Artyom
Novichonok found the comet in Sept. 2012.


12
0:1:9,67 --> 0:1:14,24
It bears the name of their night-sky survey
program, the International Scientific Optical


13
0:1:14,24 --> 0:1:16,35
Network, or ISON.


14
0:1:16,35 --> 0:1:22,35
As 2013 unfolds, the comet is still very far
away, near the orbit of Jupiter.   That’s


15
0:1:22,35 --> 0:1:26,799
why it looks like a speck.   “But for
an object at such extreme distance, it is


16
0:1:26,799 --> 0:1:29,53
actually very bright," says Battams. 


17
0:1:29,53 --> 0:1:33,63
The comet’s glow suggests that is spewing
gas and dust from a fairly large nucleus,


18
0:1:33,63 --> 0:1:37,75
“in the 1 to 10 km range,” estimates Matthew
Knight of the Lowell Observatory.  


19
0:1:37,75 --> 0:1:43,939
On Nov. 28, 2013, this “dirty snowball”
will fly through the sun's atmosphere little


20
0:1:43,939 --> 0:1:50,84
more than a million km from the stellar surface.
If the comet survives, a big IF, it could


21
0:1:50,84 --> 0:1:56,429
emerge glowing as brightly as the Moon, briefly
visible near the sun in broad daylight. The


22
0:1:56,429 --> 0:2:2,609
comet's dusty tail stretching into the night
sky could create a worldwide sensation.


23
0:2:2,609 --> 0:2:7,219
Some reporters have started calling ISON the
"Comet of the Century," but Don Yeomans of


24
0:2:7,219 --> 0:2:10,47
NASA Near-Earth Object Program thinks that's
premature.


25
0:2:10,47 --> 0:2:17,1
"I'm old enough to remember the last 'Comet
of the Century'," he says.  In 1973, a distant


26
0:2:17,1 --> 0:2:22,68
comet named Kohoutek looked like it would
put on a great show, much like ISON.  The


27
0:2:22,68 --> 0:2:26,47
actual apparition was such a letdown that
Johnny Carson made jokes about it on the Tonight


28
0:2:26,47 --> 0:2:31,2
Show. “It fizzled,” says Yeomans. “Comets
are notoriously unpredictable.”


29
0:2:31,2 --> 0:2:37,8
"Comet ISON has the potential to live up to
the hype, but it also has the potential to


30
0:2:37,8 --> 0:2:39,67
do nothing," agrees Battams.


31
0:2:39,67 --> 0:2:45,36
One hazard is the sun. Solar radiation can
affect the comet’s trajectory and gravitational


32
0:2:45,36 --> 0:2:51,11
effects have been known to destroy comets.
A recent example is Comet Elenin, which broke


33
0:2:51,11 --> 0:2:57,36
apart and dissipated in 2011 as it approached
the sun.  Elenin, however, was a much smaller


34
0:2:57,36 --> 0:2:57,94
comet.


35
0:2:57,94 --> 0:3:5,67
A better comparison, perhaps, is Comet Lovejoy,
which flew through the sun's atmosphere in


36
0:3:5,67 --> 0:3:13,5
2011.  Lovejoy emerged intact and wowed observers
with a garish tail for weeks.


37
0:3:13,5 --> 0:3:17,98
"Comet ISON is probably at least twice as
big as Comet Lovejoy,” notes Knight. “This


38
0:3:17,98 --> 0:3:23,45
would seem to favor Comet ISON surviving and
ultimately putting on a good show.


39
0:3:23,45 --> 0:3:28,85
One of the most exciting possibilities would
be a partial break-up.  "If Comet ISON splits,


40
0:3:28,85 --> 0:3:33,22
it might appear as a 'string of pearls' when
viewed through a telescope," speculates Battams.


41
0:3:33,22 --> 0:3:39,84
 “It might even resemble the famous Comet
Shoemaker-Levy 9 that hit Jupiter in 1994.”


42
0:3:39,84 --> 0:3:44,48
A break-up would pose no threat to Earth,
assures Yeomans.  "Comet ISON is not on a


43
0:3:44,48 --> 0:3:49,82
collision course. If it breaks up, the fragments
would continue along the same safe trajectory


44
0:3:49,82 --> 0:3:52,15
as the original comet."


45
0:3:52,15 --> 0:3:56,98
Whatever happens, northern sky watchers will
get a good view. For months after it swings


46
0:3:56,98 --> 0:4:2,34
by the sun, Comet ISON will be well placed
for observers in the northern hemisphere. 


47
0:4:2,34 --> 0:4:6,98
It will pass almost directly over the North
Pole, making it a circumpolar object visible


48
0:4:6,98 --> 0:4:9,1
all night long.


49
0:4:9,1 --> 0:6:9,1
Will comet ISON fizzle or sizzle? The answer
will be plain to see.
