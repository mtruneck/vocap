###55 Lyman Lemnitzer, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
###58 presents a proposal to Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara, named Operation Northwoods.
###63 The document proposed staging terrorist attacks in and around Guantanamo Bay,
###68 to provide a pretext for military intervention in Cuba.
###72 The plans included:
###74 Starting rumors about Cuba using clandestine radio.
###76 Landing friendly Cubans inside the base to stage attacks.
###79 Starting riots at the main gate.
###82 Blowing up ammunition inside the base, starting fires.
###85 Sabotaging aircrafts and ships on the base.
###89 Bombing the base with mortar shells.
###91 Sinking a ship outside the entrance, staging funerals for mock victims.
###96 Staging a terror campaign in Miami, Florida and Washington, DC.
###101 And finally, destroying a drone aircraft, over Cuban waters.
###104 The passengers, federal agents in reality, would allegedly be college students on vacation.
###110 A plane at Eglin Air Force Base would be painted and numbered as a duplicate of a registered civil aircraft
###114 belonging to a CIA front in Miami.
###117 The duplicate would be substituted for the real plane and loaded with the passengers.
###121 The real plane would be converted into a drone.
###124 The two planes would randezvous south of Florida.
###126 The passenger laden plane would land at Eglin Air Force Base to evacuate its passengers and return to its original status.
###132 The drone would pick up the scheduled flight plan and over Cuban waters transmit a "mayday signal" before being blown up by remote control.
###139 The plan was rejected by McNamara, and President John F. Kennedy personally removes Lemnitzer as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
###147 December 1st, 1984.
###150 A remote-controlled Boeing 720 takes off from Edwards Air Force Base, and is crash-landed by NASA for fuel research.

###409 The National Recognisance Office in Chantilly, Virginia is preparing for an exercise in which a small corporate jet crashes into their building.
###417 NORAD is in the middle of a number of military exercises.
###421 The first, "Vigilant Guardian", is described as
###424 "an exercise that would pose an imaginary crisis to North American Air Defense outposts nationwide".
###430 The second, "Northern Vigilance", moved fighter jets to Canada and Alaska to fight off an imaginary Russian fleet.
###438 Three F-16s from Washington DC's National Guard at Andrews Air Force Base,
###443 15 miles from the Pentagon, are flown 180 nautical miles away for a training mission in North Carolina.
###451 This left 14 fighter jets to protect the entire United States.
###455 " Hi, Boston Center TMU, we have a  problem here "
###458 " we have a hijacked aircraft headed towards New York "
###461 " and we need you guys to, we need someone to scramble some F-16s or something up there, help us out. "
###467 " Is this real or exercise? " " No, this is not exercise, not a test. "
###474 " Do we wanna think about scrambling an aircraft? "
###480 " Oooh, God I don't know. "
###483 " That's a decision somebody's gonna have to make probably in the next 10 minutes. "
###489 " Uh, yeah, you know, everybody just left the room. "
###493 " The first question I have is basically to get from you a sense of "
###496 " how you would rate the american media in their coverage of the events of the attack last September? "
###501 [Hunter S Thomson] " Well let's see eehmmm, shamefully is a word that comes to mind "
###506 " This just in you are looking at obviously very disturbing liveshot there "
###511 " that is the World Trade Center and we have unconfirmed reports this morning "
###515 " that a plane had crashed into one of the towers of the World Trade Center. "
###519 "But overall, the American journalism was cowed, "
###522 " and intimidated by the this massive flag-sucking, this patriotic, orgy...  "
###528 " you know if you're criticizing the president it's unpatriotic and there's something wrong with you and you may be a terrorist..."
###533 " So, so in that sense,Hunter S Thomson, there's not enough room for dissenting voices? "
###538 " Well, there's plenty of room, just not enough people willing to take the risk. "
###542 " I don't know whether we've confirmed that this was an aircraft or to be more specific "
###547 " some people said they thought they saw a missile. "
###550 " There was definitely a blue logo, [it was l-] circular logo on the front of the plane "
###554 " it definitely did not look like a commercial plane, I didn't see any windows on the sides. "
###558 " Mark, if that what you say is true those could be cargo planes. "
###561 " You said, you didn't see any windows in the sides? "
###563 " I didn't see any windows on sides. It was not a normal flight that I had ever seen, "
###568 " at an airport, it was a plane that had a blue logo on the front "
###572 " and, and it just ... it did not look like it belonged in this area. "
###575 " It's sort of a herd mentality a lemming-like mentality. "
###580 " if you don't go with the flow you're anti-american and therefore a suspect. "
###586 " This is as close as we can get to the base of the World Trade Center "
###589 " you can see the firemen assembled here, the police officers, FBI agents "
###592 " and you can see the Two Towers, a huge explosion, raining debris on all of us. We better get out of the way! "
###642 " You sort of wonder, when something like that happens, "
###644 " who stands to benefit? Who had the opportunity and motive? "
###649 " You just gotta look at this basic things. "
###651 " I don't assume that I know the truth about what went on that day. "
###655 " And yeah, I just look around looking for "
###658 " who had the motive, who had the opportunity, who had the equipment, "
###662 " who had the will... "
###687 " I've spent enough time on the inside, well the White House, and, you know campaigns, "
###691 " and I've known enough of the people who do these things, "
###694 " to know that, the public version of the news, of an event, is never really what happened. "
###699 " And these people I think are willing to take that even further. "
###711 " It seems a very long bow to me, but are you sort of suggesting that this worked in a favor of the Bush administration? "
###717 " Oh absolutely, ... absolutely. "
###767 9:38. Arlington, Virginia.
###774 Hani Hanjour allegedly executes a 330 degree turn at 530 MPH
###782 descending 7,000 feet in two and a half minutes to crash American Airlines Flight 77 into the ground floor of the Pentagon.
###805 Its final approach took it directly across Interstate-395,
###814 knocking light poles out of the ground and bouncing off of the lawn before impact.
###822 First, let's meet Hani Hanjour.
###826 Hanjour came to Freeway Airport in Bowie, Maryland, one month earlier seeking to rent a small plane.
###832 However, when Hanjour went on three test runs in the second week of August
###836 he had trouble controlling and landing a single engine Cessna 172.
###842 " Hello, my name is Marcel Bernard and I'm the chief flight instructor here at Freeway. "
###847 " Hani Hanjour, well basically what happened with him "
###851 " is... he showed at the airport and wanted to get "
###855 " checked out in the aircraft you see, he was already certified "
###858 " he didn't come to us for flight training. "
###860 " Yeah, he already had a pilot's license. "
###861 " He already earned a "
###862 " it was private,instrument,commercial at a school in Arizona I don't remember the name of the school. "
###868 " He already had certificates in hand and "
###870 " we sometimes occasionally have pilots who come to us that don't want flight training, but just want to "
###876 " rent our aircraft. "
###877 " Which is the case of Hani Hanjour? "
###879 " This was the case of Hani, he wanted to get "checked-out" as we call it to rent our aircraft. "
###883 " And our insurance requires that he flies with one of our instructors "
###886 " to be found competent to rent. "
###888 " And that was the process that he was going through. "
###891 " And consensus was , he was very quiet, "
###895 " average, or below average piloting skills, "
###899 " English was very poor "
###902 " so, that's about the best description i can get, give you "
###907 " for his demeanor. "
###910 " At that time very uneventful from my perspective. "
###916 Regardless, air traffic controllers at Dulles International Airport that were tracking Flight 77
###921 all thought that it was a military plane.
###925 Second. The light poles.
###929 On November 22nd, 2004, a private jet en route to Houston to pick up George Bush Senior
###934 clipped a single light pole and crashed a minute away from landing at Houston's Hobby Airport.
###940 The wing ripped off upon impact, scattering debris over 100 yards.
###946 And yet, Flight 77 managed to tear 5 light poles completely out of the ground,
###950 without damaging either the wings or the light poles themselves.
###953 Instead, they seem to have just popped out of the ground.
###959 Third. You only have to look at the photos from that day to realize that whatever hit the Pentagon did not bounce off the lawn.
###966 If Flight 77 had crash landed and skidded into the Pentagon, it would have looked like this.
###976 Instead, it looked like this, without a single scratch on the lawn.
###983 Fourth. Why is there absolutely no trace of Flight 77?
###988 " You know, it, it might've appeared that way "
###990 " but from my closeup inspection there's no evidence "
###994 " of a plane having crashed anywhere near the Pentagon. "
###997 " The only sight is the actual side of the building that's crashed in, "
###1001 " and as I said the only pieces left that you can see "
###1004 " are small enough that you can pick up in your hand. "
###1007 " There are no large tail sections, wing sections, "
###1010 " a fuselage, nothing like that anywhere around, which would indicate, "
###1014 " that the entire plane crashed into the side of the Pentagon  ... "
###1019 The official explanation is that the intense heat from the jet fuel vaporized the entire plane.
###1026 Indeed. From these pictures, it seems that there is absolutely no trace of a Boeing 757.
###1034 But if the fire was hot enough to incinerate a jumbo jet,
###1037 then how could investigators identify 184 out of 189 people found at the Pentagon?
###1043 The Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory, which was responsible for the task,
###1047 was also responsible for identifying the dead in Shanksville.
###1052 Keep that in mind for later.
###1054 So what is a Boeing 757 made of? I called Boeing to ask, but ...
###1060 The operator informed me that Boeing refuses to give out any information regarding the construction of their aircraft.
###1066 Due to the attacks of September 11th.
###1070 But what we do know, is that the 757 has two Pratt & Whitney engines made of steel and titanium alloy
###1076 which are 9 feet in diameter, 12 feet long and weigh 6 tons each.
###1083 Titanium, has a melting point of 1688 degrees Celsius.
###1088 Jet fuel, also known as kerosene, is a hydrocarbon, which can retain a constant temperature
###1093 of 1120 degrees Celsius after 40 minutes , but only if the fuel is maintained.
###1100 The fuel would have burned off immediately upon impact.
###1103 Therefore, it is scientifically impossible that 12 tons of steel and titanium was vaporized by kerosene.
###1110 Likewise, the two engines should have been found relatively intact at the Pentagon.
###1115 Instead, there was a single turbo-jet engine approximately 3 feet in diameter found inside the building.
###1123 After this photo was published by American Free Press,
###1126 readers wrote in to suggest that the turbine was a piece from the Auxilliary Power Unit - APU mounted in the tail section of the 757.
###1135 Chris Bollyn contacted Honeywell in Phoenix, Arizona, the manufacturer of a 757's APU.
###1141 An expert, speaking on the condition of anonymity told him that: " There's no way that's an APU wheel ".
###1147 Bollyn then contacted Pratt & Whitney and Rolls-Royce,
###1150 the two companies that manufacture 757 engines.
###1153 Pratt & Whitney pointed Bollyn towards Rolls-Royce and John W Brown a spokesman for Rolls-Royce told Bollyn that:
###1160 " It is not a part from any Rolls-Royce engine that I'm familiar with. "
###1165 In an article written by Karl Schwartz
###1167 President and Chief Executive Officer of Patmos Nanotechnologies LLC and I-nets Security Systems
###1173 he believes that the piece is a JT8D Turbojet Engine from the US Air Force A3 ScottWarrior.
###1180 The piece in the FEMA photo is the front shaft bearing housing.
###1183 Jet engines have a center shaft which must be balanced as well as bare seals on the front and back.
###1190 The photo shows the front seal and a rotar hub missing its fan blades.
###1193 These blades are easily removed in a collision such as the one found at the Pentagon.
###1199 The United States Air Force has only a few A3's left in operation,
###1203 and they're stored in Van Nuys California at Hughes Aircraft,
###1206 which is now better known as Raytheon.
###1210 So if this piece didn't come from a 757, then where? And where are the engines from Flight 77?
###1218 The second identifiable piece of debris was allegedly a piece of the fuselage.
###1222 Skeptics have claimed that this is proof that Flight 77 hit the Pentagon.
###1226 But this piece could have come from any American Airlines plane.
###1230 And why is it not singed or scratched after a 530 MPH impact and a subsequent fireball.
###1238 The third piece of debris was a diffusor case.
###1240 Let's look a little closer at the diffusor case of a 757.
###1244 Do you see the triangular bezels around the openings?
###1248 Those are nowhere to be found on the case found at the Pentagon.
###1253 The remainder of the debris was light enough to have been carried by hand.
###1256 And employees at the Pentagon were seen carrying away a large box shrouded in a blue tarp.
###1261 Why the mystery?
###1264 If Flight 77 was vaporized on impact, it would be the first time in aviation history.
###1271 For example. August 15th, 2005.
###1274 Helios Airways Flight 522, a Boeing 737, en route to Athens, Greece crashed into a hillside at full speed.
###1281 121 passengers, all dead.
###1285 Fire. Tail sections. Wing sections.
###1291 Engines. Cockpit. Bodies.
###1297 Catch my drift?
###1298 Fifth. Why is the damage to the Pentagon completely inconsistent with a Boeing 757?
###1316 These photos were taken before the roof of the outer ring had collapsed.
###1320 The only damage to the outer wall is a single hole, no more than 16 feet in diameter.
###1329 A Boeing 757 is 155 feet long, 44 feet high,
###1336 has a 124 foot wingspan, and weighs almost 100 tons.
###1341 Are we supposed to believe that it disappeared into this hole, without leaving any wreckage on the outside?
###1347 Why is there no damage from where the wings, or the vertical stabilizer,
###1350 or the engines would have slammed into the building?
###1356 Remember how big the engines were?
###1358 If 6 tons of steel and titanium slammed into the Pentagon at 530 MPH,
###1363 they would bury themselves inside the building, leaving two very distinct imprints.
###1367 And yet, the only damage on the outside of the Pentagon is this single hole,
###1371 with no damage from where the engines would have hit.
###1375 Why are the windows next to the hole completely intact?
###1380 Why are the cable spools directly in front of the hole completely untouched?
###1386 And as for the inside of the Pentagon, there's another hole approximately 16 feet in diameter
###1391 found on the other side of the C ring, three rings from the impact.
###1394 For that hole to have been caused by Flight 77,
###1397 the Boeing would have had to smash through 9 feet of steel reinforced concrete.
###1403 The nose of a commercial airliner is composed of light-weight carbon.
###1407 This is what usually happens to the nose of a commercial airliner in a plane crash.
###1414 If the nose caused this hole, where's the rest of the debris from the plane?
###1420 So what could blow a 16 foot hole in the outer ring of the Pentagon,
###1424 smash through 9 feet of steel reinforced concrete and leave another 16 foot hole?
###1430 A cruise missile.
###1434 This is what Slobodan Milosevic's residence in Belgrade looked like after a TomaHawk cruise missile had hit it.
###1440 See any similarities?
###1445 Sixth, the eyewitnesses.
###1446 Some saw a huge 100 ton commercial airliner.
###1450 " And I looked off, I was, you know looked out my window I saw this plane, jet, American Airlines jet coming. "
###1458 Some saw a small, 8 to 20 passenger commuter plane.
###1464 " ...maybe a 20 passenger corporate jet, no markings on the sides... "
###1469 And some saw a United States Military helicopter.
###1473 " ...when it occured, he said that he saw a helicopter circle the building. "
###1477 " He said that it appeared to be a US Military helicopter, and that it disappeared behind the building where the helicopter landing zone is."
###1485 " And that he then saw a fireball goin to the sky. "
###1489 So who's telling the truth? Take this into consideration.
###1493 April Gallop was working in the Pentagon's west side when it was hit.
###1497 In Jim Marrs' book Inside Job, April claims...
###1500 " While in the hospital, men in suits visited her more than once. "
###1504 " They never identified themselves or what agency they worked for. "
###1508 " They didn't tell her what to say, just made suggestions. "
###1510 " For example, to take the compensation money and shut up. "
###1513 " They also kept insisting that a plane hit the building. They repeated this over and over. "
###1518 " But I was there, and I never saw a plane, or even debris from a plane. "
###1521 " I figure this story is to brainwash people. "
###1525 So if a Boeing 757 didn't hit the Pentagon, then what did?
###1529 Eyewitnesses inside and outside the building were thrown to the ground by what they described as a shockwave.
###1559 Even the Sheraton Hotel, 1.6 Miles away, was rocked by the blast.
###1565 A number of military personnel at the Pentagon specifically mentioned smelling cordite.
###1578 Cordite and jet fuel have two very distinct smells.
###1583 Cordite is a compound used in ammunition, which is comprised of nitroguanidine, nitrocellulose, and nitroglycerin.
###1590 It is cool-burning, produces little smoke and no flash, but produces a strong detonation wave.
###1598 And, eyewitnesses described a bright, silvery flash.
###1601 Jet fuel combustion, i.e. the planes that struck the Twin Towers, is bright yellow at best.
###1607 Watch this.
###1610 A massive smouldering fireball, no silvery flash, no shockwave.
###1615 And at the Pentagon, a tiny bright silvery flash, which shakes nearby buildings.
###1622 Whatever it was, it might have been related to the two planes that were in the air after the crash.
###1628 The first one was uniformly identified as a C-130.
###1648 The second plane was an unmarked white plane flying over Washington DC.
###1656 " Aaron, I'm standing in Lafayette Park directly across from the White House "
###1659 " perhaps about 200 yards from the White House residence itself "
###1662 " about 10 minutes ago there was a white jet circling overhead. "
###1666 " Now you generally don't see planes in the area over the White House, that is restricted airspace. "
###1671 " No reason to believe that this jet was there for any nefarious purposes, "
###1675 " but the Secret Service was very concerned, pointing up at the jet in the sky. "
###1678 " It is out of sight now, best we can tell. "
###1682 At 9:25, Jane Garvey, the head of the FAA, initiated a national ground stop,
###1687 which prevents further takeoffs and requires all planes in the air to land.
###1691 The order, which hasn't been implemented since 1903, applied to almost every single kind of a plane:
###1697 civilian, military, or law enforcement.
###1699 Certain military flights were allowed to fly during this time, but the FAA isn't talking.
###1704 Why were these two planes allowed in the air when everyone else had to land?
###1709 And finally, why did people keep reporting a second explosion at the Pentagon?
###1714 " Well, I can't tell you about that, but I was just here in front of the capital, which by the way has been evacuated, "
###1720 " and back toward the Supreme Court area we just heard a low muffled thud. "
###1724 " It sounded like a small explosion. "
###1727 " There have been unconfirmed reports of second explosions here at the Pentagon, we have not confirmed that, but again ... "
###1735 Where did this fireball come from?
###1740 Seventh, surveillance cameras from a gas station, Sheraton Hotel,
###1746 and the Virginia Department of Transportation captured the entire thing.
###1752 However, the FBI was there within minutes to confiscate the tapes,
###1755 including a warning for the employees not to discuss what they had seen.
###1759 If the government wishes to prove once and for all that Flight 77 hit the Pentagon,
###1763 all they would have to do is release one of those tapes.
###1767 Instead, they released 5 frames from a camera across the heliport, even though none of them show a 757.
###1784 And finally, why do satellite photos taken 4 days before 9/11 show a white marking on the front lawn,
###1789 marking almost the exact trajectory of whatever hit the Pentagon 4 days later?
###1795 And is it merely a coincidence that the Pentagon was hit in the only section
###1799 that was renovated to withstand that very same kind of attack,
###1804 and that Donald Rumsfeld was safe in his office on the opposite end of the building?
###1810 If the government has nothing to hide, why are they so afraid to answer a few questions, or release a few videos?
###1842 9:59. New York City, New York.
###1847 The South Tower of the World Trade Center collapses to the ground in approximately 10 seconds.
###1855 29 minutes later the North Tower follows suit, collapsing in approximately 10 seconds.
###1862 Later that evening at 5:20, WTC 7, a 47 storey office building 300 feet away from the North Tower, suddenly collapses.
###1870 The building's tenants included the CIA, Department of Defense, IRS, Secret Service and Rudy Giuliani's emergency bunker.
###1878 And the SeC was using it to store 3 to 4 thousand files related to numerous Wall Street investigations.
###1886 Although every single building surrounding Building 7 stood intact, it fell straight down,
###1891 into a convenient little pile, in 6 seconds.
###1897 Official explanation? Falling debris from the Twin Towers created an internal fire,
###1901 which ignited several fuel tanks inside the building.
###1906 If this is true, then it would be the third building in history to collapse because of a fire.
###1912 The first two would be the Twin Towers.
###1916 On July 28th, 1945, a B-25 bomber lost in the fog crashed into the 79th floor of the Empire State Building.
###1924 14 people dead, 1 million dollars in damage. But, the building stands intact to this day.
###1933 On February 14th, 1975, a three alarm fire broke out between in the 9th and 14th floors in the North Tower.
###1940 According to the New York Times, "The fire leads to intense scrutiny of the towers "
###1944 " and eventually to a decision to install sprinklers. "
###1949 On May 4th, 1988, a 62 storey skyscraper in Los Angeles burned for 3 hours and spread over 4 floors.
###1956 It did not collapse.
###1959 On February 23rd, 1991, a 38 storey skyscraper in Philadelphia, built in 1973,
###1965 burned for more than 19 hours and spread over 8 floors. It did not collapse.
###1972 On October 17th, 2004, a 56 storey skyscraper in Venezuela, built in 1976,
###1978 burned for over 17 hours and spread over 26 floors, eventually reaching the roof.
###1984 Guess what? It did not collapse.
###1987 On February 12th, 2005, the Windsor Building in Madrid, a 32 storey tower framed in steel reinforced concrete,
###1995 burned for almost 24 hours, completely eradicating the upper 10 stories of the building.
###2000 Although the top 10 floors of the building fell, the building itself did not collapse.
###2008 And yet on September 11th, 2001, two 110 storey skyscrapers, completed in 1973,
###2015 burned for 56 minutes and 103 minutes respectively, over 4 floors,
###2021 before collapsing completely to the ground.
###2024 One might argue, that this was due to the construction of the World Trade Center.
###2028 Let's look at, what was inside those buildings.
###2032 The Twin Towers were composed of 200,000 tons of steel, 425,000 cubic yards of concrete,
###2040 103 elevators, 43 600 windows,
###2046 60 000 tons of cooling equipment,
###2049 and a 360 foot  television antenna.
###2053 The core of each tower was 87 by 133 feet,
###2057 comprised of 47 box columns 36 by 16 inches thick.
###2064 The North Tower was completed in 1970 standing at 1368 feet tall
###2069 and the South Tower was completed in 1973 clocking in at 1362 feet tall,
###2075 making them the tallest buildings in the world until the Sears Tower was completed in 1974.
###2083 And to think... the government want have us believe that these massive structures
###2087 were destroyed by 10 000 gallons of jet fuel.
###2089 However, eyewitnesses, video footage and a little common sense quickly refutes that claim.
###2097 The second plane hits the South Tower between the 78th and 82nd floors at 9:03 AM,
###2114 barely hitting the southeast corner, the majority of the jet fuel exploding outside in a massive fireball.
###2122 Yet, this Tower collapses first, even though the North Tower was hit straight on,
###2126 and had already been burning for 18 minutes longer.
###2130 Galileio's Law of Falling Bodies calculates the time in which an object will travel a certain distance in complete freefall.
###2137 Distance (D) = 16.08 times Time in seconds squared.
###2141 The South Tower was 1362 feet tall.
###2145 1362 = 16.08 times 84.70. Or, 9.2 seconds.
###2165 The Twin Towers came down in nearly freefall speed.
###2168 200,000 tons of steel shatters into sections no longer than a couple feet long.
###2173 425,000 cubic yards of concrete is pulverized into dust.
###2178 Thousands of lives are extinguished instantly.
###2182 So what brought down the World Trade Center?
###2184 Let's ask the experts.
###2186 Van Romero. Vice President for Research at New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology.
###2191 " My opinion is, based on the videotapes, after the airplanes hit the World Trade Center "
###2196 " there were some explosive devices inside that caused the towers to collapse. "
###2200 " The collapses were  too methodical to be a chance result of airplanes colliding with the structures. "
###2205 Ten days later. " Certainly the fire is what caused the building to fail. "
###2209 Why would Romero change his mind so suddenly?
###2212 Hyman Brown. Civil Engineering Professor and the World Trade Center's construction manager.
###2216 " It was over-designed to withstand almost anything including hurricanes, high winds, bombings and an airplane hitting it... "
###2223 " Although the buildings were designed to withstand "a 150-year storm" and the impact of a Boeing 707, "
###2229 " jet fuel burning at 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit weakened the steel. "
###2233 Kevin Ryan. Underwriters Laboratories, the company that certified the steel that was used in the World Trade Center,
###2239 in a letter to Frank Gayle of the National Institute of Standards and Technology.
###2243 " We know that the steel components were certified to ASTM E119. "
###2247 " The time temperature curves for this standard require the samples to be exposed to temperatures around 2000F for several hours. "
###2254 " And as we all agree, the steel applied met those specifications. "
###2258 " Additionally, I think we can all agree that even un-fireproofed steel "
###2262 " will not melt until reaching red-hot temperatures of nearly 3000F. "
###2266 Why Dr. Brown would imply that 2000F would melt the high-grade steel used in those buildings makes no sense at all.
###2273 " This story just does not add up. "
###2275 " If steel from those buildings did soften or melt, I'm sure we can all agree that this was certainly not due "
###2280 " to jet fuel fires of any kind, let alone the briefly burning fires in those towers. "
###2286 Ryan's statements directly contradict statements from so-called "experts",
###2290 which claim that 2000 degree heat inside the WTC caused the towers to collapse.
###2296 Days after writing this letter, Kevin Ryan was fired from his position.
###2301 Not even the experts agree with each other.
###2302 So what else could have caused the Twin Towers and Building 7 to collapse?
###2307 " 10 o'clock eastern time this morning just collapsing on itself. "
###2312 " The second building that was hit by the plane has just completely collapsed. "
###2316 " We have no idea what caused this. "
###2318 " Almost looks like one of those planned implosions. "
###2322 " As if a demolition team set off, when you see the whole demolitions of whole buildings. "
###2326 " It folded down on itself and it was not there anymore. "
###2329 " If you wish to bring anybody who's ever watched a building being demolished on purpose "
###2335 " knows , that if you're going to do this, you have to get at the "
###2338 " at the under infrastructure of a building and bring it down. "
###2342 " We heard another explosion and I'm assuming that's the one that came from the lower level. "
###2347 " Since there were two..." " Right, cause it was like 18 minutes apart. "
###2351 " Well... this is, no the first, the first explosion and there was the second explosion in the same building. "
###2356 " There were 2 explosions. "
###2358 " Federal Agencies that were down there do believe that there was some sort of explosive device, "
###2362 " somewhere else besides the planes hitting. "
###2365 " NBC's Pat Dawson is close to the scene of that attack, Pat? "
###2369 " Just moments ago I spoke to the Chief of Safety for the New York City Fire Department, "
###2376 " the Chief Albert Turi, he received word of the possibility of the secondary device "
###2381 " that is another bomb going off, he tried to get his men out as quickly as he could, "
###2386 " but he said that there was another explosion which took place "
###2389 " and then, an hour after the first hit here, the first crash that took place, he said "
###2395 " there was another explosion that took place "
###2399 " in one of the Towers here. He thinks that there were actually devices that were planted in the building, "
###2405 " The second device, he thinks, he speculates, was probably planted in the building. "
###2412 " There were two or three similar huge explosions and the building "
###2417 " literally shook, it literally shook at the base of this building. "
###2420 " First one and then the other, some say after secondary explosions. "
###2425 " ...big explosion happened, all of a sudden the elevator blew up, smoke, I dragged the guy out, his skin was hanging off, "
###2431 " and I dragged him out and I helped him to the ambulance. "
###2435 " We started coming down the stairs from the eighth floor. Big Explosion. Blew us back into the eighth floor. "
###2440 " Just came out of the tunnel, and it blew. " " The subway tunnel?" " Yeah. "
###2445 " So, tell us what's happening out there."
###2447 " We just witnessed some kind of secondary, follow up explosion on the World Trade Center number 2. " "Secondary."
###2454 " We understand now there has been a secondary explosion on Tower 2. "
###2459 " There was another major explosion. The building itself, literally the top of it came down sending smoke and debris everywhere. "
###2466 " We are five blocks from the World Trade Center. "
###2468 " And, and we were standing here, when, when there was some sort of collapse, or explosion. "
###2474 " Do you know if it was an explosion, or if it was a building collapse? "
###2478 " To me it sounded like, to me it sounded like an explosion ... "
###2483 " We heard a big explosion coming down. "
###2486 " Everything it went black. Everything came down, glass started popping, people got hurt, stuff went on top of them, "
###2493 " and there was a big explosion, and everything got dark. Real dark like smoke. "
###2498 " The FBI is here as you can see, they had roped this area off, they were taking photographs and securing this area. "
###2504 " Just prior to that huge explosion that we all heard and felt. "
###2509 " Get out of the area. The second Tower is coming down. "
###2513 " Did they tell you the second Tower is coming down? " " Yes, it's about to collapse. "
###2515 " At 10:30 I tried to leave the building. As soon as I got outside I heard a second explosion. "
###2520 " And another rumble, and more smoke, and more dust. I ran inside the building, the chandelier shook "
###2526 " and again black smoke filled the air. Within another 5 minutes we were covered again with more silt and more dust. "
###2533 " And then a Fire Marshall came in and said we had to leave, because if there was a third explosion this building might not last. "
###2541 " We just saw that as well, the second Tower "
###2545 " the only one that was standing, Tower number one just ah we saw some kind of explosion a lot of smoke come out of the top "
###2551 " of the Tower, and then it collapsed down onto the streets below. "
###2555 " David Lee, what can you tell us? "
###2557 " John, just seconds ago there was a huge explosion and it appears right now the second World Trade Tower has just collapsed. "
###2564 One eyewitness was standing among a crowd of people on Church Street, two and a half blocks from the South Tower,
###2570 when he saw a number of brief light sources being emitted from inside the building between floors 10 and 15.
###2575 He saw about six of these flashes, accompanied by a crackling sound before the Tower collapsed.
###2582 Ginny Carr was attending a business  meeting on the 36th floor of One Liberty Plaza, across the street from the WTC, and caught the entire first attack on tape.
###2589 A second explosion can be heard nine seconds after the crash.
###2608 " ...sounded like some crash... "
###2612 So, what happened in the North Tower? Ask Willy Rodriguez.
###2615 Willy, a janitor who worked in the World Trade Center for 20 years was in sub level 1 when the North Tower was hit.
###2622 " And all of a sudden we heard boom! "
###2625 " And I thought it was a generator that blew up in the basement. "
###2629 " And I said to myself: Oh my God, I think that's the generator. "
###2633 " And I was going to verbalize it, and when I finished saying that in my mind, I hear boom! "
###2638 " Right on the top. Pretty far away. "
###2642 " So, it was a difference between coming from the basement and coming from the top. "
###2647 " And thats..., everybody started screaming. And a person comes running into the office saying: Explosion, explosion, explosion! "
###2654 " He had his hands extended. And all the skin was falling from under his arm. "
###2658 " All the way to the top of the fingertips. And it was hanging from both arms. "
###2662 "Hanging and hanging. And then I looked at his face and he was missing parts of his face. "
###2668 " And I said: What happened? What happened? " " And he said: The elevators, the elevators. " "And then..."
###2674 " When I..., there were many explosions, and when I actually talked about those explosions, they said that: "
###2680 " Well, there were so many kitchens in the building. "
###2683 " They have probably those gas canisters. "
###2687 " And I say: I don't believe that, because the building was a class A building. "
###2692 " They have very strict guidelines of what you can put in a kitchen. "
###2695 " And I really doubt it was gas. "
###2698 " So, there was a lot of misconceptions of what happened on that day in terms of the explosions. "
###2704 " Up to today, I haven't received an actual explanation about the different explosions that I heard on the upper floors. "
###2711 " And on the way to the top. "
###2714 The windows in the lobby of the North Tower were blown out,
###2721 and marble panels were blown off of the walls.
###2725 This was brushed off as damage from a raging fireball that went barreling down the elevator schafts.
###2731 However, the World Trade Center's core and elevator shafts were hermetically sealed, AKA, air-tight.
###2736 The fire could not possibly have had enough oxygen to travel 1,300 feet down,
###2742 retaining enough energy to destroy the bottom 8 floors of the building.
###2748 On 9-11, New York City lost 343 firefighters at the World Trade Center.
###2753 Since they were the ones inside the Towers before and as they collapsed,
###2757 I'd say they've got a pretty good grasp on what happened.
###2760 So, what does the FDNY think? First, we have this interview from the Naudet brothers' documentary.
###2768 " ...what do we do? We made it outside, we made it about a block? " " We made it at least 2 blocks "
###2774 " and we started running.. boom-boom-boom-boom. Floor by floor it started popping out. "
###2778 " It was like, as if they had detonated? " " Yeah, detonated." " Take out the building. Boom-boom-boom-boom. "
###2784 "...all the way down, I was watching it and running."
###2787 " And then you just saw this cloud of shit chasing you down. "
###2791 " Could not ... "
###2792 In these interviews, numerous members of Engine 7 describe explosions preceeding the collapses.
###2797 not to mention the damage to the lobby of the North Tower.
###2801 " I heard a loud boom. And my first ..."
###2804 " I was, I was right at the desk there on the lefthand side when you come into Tower 1. "
###2809 " And I walked out, you know I didn't go out I walked to where all the doorway, where the glass was broken, "
###2815 " and I looked out and I've seen in the building across the street. "
###2819 " I seen the shadow coming like the, I seen the shadow on a building across the street "
###2824 " coming down. "
###2825 " I wasn't expecting to see the damage that I saw in the lobby. "
###2829 " And, and the people, the bodies, the burned people, the injured people, "
###2835 " I really wasn't prepared for that. "
###2837 " The lobby was about 6 storeys high and the lobby looked as though a bomb had exploded there."
###2842 " It's a... all the glass was taken out, there were 10 foot by 10 foot, "
###2847 " a marble panels that were once walls "
###2851 " that were loose from the wall of the Trade Center. "
###2857 " I went around by the freight elevator and I could see it was just blown. "
###2862 " 30th floor. We hear another ...explosion. "
###2867 " And at that time we heard a huge explosion. "
###2873 Firefighter Louie Cacchioli told People Weekly:
###2876 " I was taking firefighters up in the elevator to the 24th floor to get in position to evacuate workers. "
###2881 On the last trip up a bomb went off. We think there were bombs set in the building.
###2887 For more than a year, the Port Authority blocked the release of a tape of firefighters' transmissions from the World Trade Center on 9-11.
###2894 In November 2002, the tape was released to the New York Times and other "news outlets."
###2901 Why did it take so long to get the tape released?
###2906 " I got, uh, an eyewitness who said there was an explosion on floors 7 and 8, 7,8. "
###2913 " Battalion 3 to Dispatch, we've just had another explosion. "
###2918 " ...Warren Street, because of the secondary explosion. "
###2920 " We've got numerous people covered with dust from the secondary explosion. "
###2924 " We got another explosion on the Tower, 10-13, 10-13. "
###2928 " Tower 2 has had a major explosion and what appears to be a complete collapse surrounding the entire area. "
###2933 " I was involved in the secondary, uh, explosion at Tower 1, Kay..."
###2939 Chief Palmer had reached the fire on the 78th floor of the South Tower and devised a plan to put it out.
###2946 " ... Ladder 15, we've got two isolated pockets of fire. "
###2952 " We should be able to knock it down with two lines. Radio that, 78th floor numerous 10-45 Code Ones. "
###2959 If the 78th floor was a raging inferno like the government would have us believe, then Palmer wouldn've got as far as he did
###2965 and certainly wouldn't be able to put it out.
###2969 On August 12th, 2005 an additional 15 hours of radio transmissions and transcripts of interviews with firefighters
###2976 was finally released to the public.
###2980 Firefighters describe 2 events consistent with the controlled demolition:
###2984 Bright flashes from inside the building
###3000 and a number of crackling sounds before the buildings collapsed.
###3024 What does science have to say about the collapses?
###3027 The collapse of the World Trade Center was picked up by Columbia University's observatory in Palisades, New York.
###3033 The South Tower registers at 2.1 earthquake.
###3036 The North Tower registers at 2.3 earthquake.
###3040 Won-Young Kim told Chris Bollyn that their seismographs pick up underground explosions from a quarry 20 miles away.
###3046 These blasts are caused by 80,000 lbs of ammonium nitrate and cause local earthquakes between Mag. 1 and 2.
###3053 The 1993 bombing of the WTC did not even register, because it was not coupled to the ground.
###3059 During the collapse, most of the energy of the falling debris was absorbed by the Towers and the neighboring structures
###3064 converting them into rubble and dust or causing other damage but not causing significant ground shaking.
###3071 Mark Loizeaux, the president of Controlled Demolition, Inc. told the American Free Press that in the basements of the WTC,
###3077 where 47 central support columns connected to the bedrock,
###3081 hot spots of "literally molten steel" were discovered more than a month after September 11th.
###3086 These incredibly hot areas were found at the bottoms of the elevator shafts down 7 basement levels.
###3092 The molten steel was found "three, four, and five weeks later, when the rubble was being removed. "
###3097 He said that molten steel was also found at World Trade Center 7.
###3102 The highest temperature was in the east corner of the South Tower, where a temperature of 1377F was recorded.
###3110 The molten steel in the basement was more than double that temperature.
###3115 Do you still think that jet fuel brought down the World Trade Center?
###3119 In all the videos of the collapses explosions can be seen bursting from the buildings 20 to 30 storeys below the demolition wave.
###3126 Here.
###3137 Here.
###3147 Here.
###3156 Here.
###3162 Here.
###3173 And here.
###3180 Etienne Sauret was filming her documentary, World Trade Center: The First 24 Hours,
###3184 and caught both collapses on tape. Watch carefully.
###3192 The tripod shakes 12 seconds before the North Tower begins collapsing.
###3200 And something is knocked off the right hand side of the building.
###3214 You're probably asking, if there were bombs in the building, how would they get in there without anyone noticing?
###3219 Ben Fountain, a financial analyst who worked in the World Trade Center, told People Magazine that in the weeks before 9-11,
###3225 there were a number of unannounced and unusual drills where sections of both the Twin Towers and building 7 were evacuated for 'security reasons'.
###3235 Daria Coard, a guard in the North Tower, told Newsday that security detail was working 12 hour shifts for two weeks before 9-11,
###3242 but on Thursday the 6th, bomb sniffing dogs were abruptly removed from the bulding.
###3247 So who authorized all this?
###3250 President Bush's brother, Marvin, was Board of Directors at Securacom from 1993 until fiscal year 2000.
###3258 Securacom, now known as Stratesec, is an electronic security company backed by Kuwait-American corporation,
###3265 which provided security for United Airlines, Dulles International Airport, and from the early 1990s up to the day of 9-11, the World Trade Center..
###3273 Marvin is also the former director at HCC Insurance Holdings, which insured parts of the World Trade Center on 9-11.
###3279 More information on this was supposed to be disclosed and never was.
###3283 To date the SEC has not revealed what they have learned.
###3287 If only we could examine the debris from the World Trade Center and figure out what happened.
###3291 Unfortunately, Mayor Giuliani began shipping the remains off to recycling yards overseas before investigators could even examine it.
###3299 Not even FEMA was allowed into Ground Zero.
###3301 Essentially, they blocked off a crime scene and destroyed all the evidence.
###3305 Guess who was allowed into the site?
###3308 Controlled Demolition, who was also responsible for cleaning up after the Oklahoma City Bombing in 1995.
###3313 It gets better than that. On July 15th, 2001
###3317 Controlled Demolition destroyed two 400 ft tall fuel reserve tanks from the World War II era.
###3323 The demolition was conducted for no apparent reason, and drew numerous complains from the nighborhood.
###3328 The site remains vacant to this day and a reason for the demolition has never been disclosed.
###3334 Regardless, I think what happened to the World Trade Center is simple enough.
###3338 It was brought down in a carefully planned controlled demolition.
###3341 It was a psychological attack on the American People, and it was pulled off with military precision.
###3367 10:06 AM.  Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
###3371 Flight 93 was en route from New Jersey to California with 45 passengers,
###3376 when it went off course at 8:56 over Cleveland, Ohio.
###3381 According to the official story, Flight 93 was headed for the White House
###3384 when it was overpowered by a group of passengers and crashed in Shanksville, Pennsylvania.
###3390 Out of all the events of 9-11, the one that has caused the most confusion is Flight 93.
###3395 It was shot down, it wasn't shot down.
###3398 However, evidence suggests that perhaps Flight 93 was nowhere near Shanksville.
###3404 " I wanna get quickly to Chris Chaniki he's a photographer with the Pittsburgh affiliate a Fox affiliate. "
###3411 " He was back there just a couple minutes ago and Chris, I've seen the pictures "
###3414 " it looks like there's nothing there, except for a hole in the ground. "
###3417 " Basically that's right, the only thing you can see from where we were was a big gouge in the earth "
###3423 " and some broken trees. "
###3424 You could see some people working, walking around in the area, but from where we can see there wasn't much left. "
###3430 " Any large pieces of debris at all? "
###3432 " No, there was nothing. Nothing, that you can distinguish that a plane had crashed there. "
###3436 " Smoke, fire? " " Nothing, it was absolutely quiet, it was actually very quiet. "
###3442 " Nothing going on down there, no smoke, no fire, just a couple of people walking around "
###3447 " They look like part of the NTSB crew. Walking around, looking at the pieces. "
###3451 " How big would you say that hole was? "
###3453 " From my estimates, I would guess it was probably around 20 to 15 feet "
###3457 " long, and probably about 10 feet wide. "
###3461 " What could you see on the ground  if anything other than dirt and ash and...? "
###3465 " You couldn't see anything. You just see dirt, ash and people walking around, broken trees. "
###3472 Wally Miller, a Somerset County coroner, told the Houston Chronicle "It looked like somebody just dropped a bunch of metal out of the sky. "
###3478 In the Washington Post...
###3479 "It looked like someone took a scrap truck, dug a 10-foot ditch and dumped trash into it."
###3484 And as for the passengers...
###3486 " I stopped being coroner after about 20 minutes, because there were no bodies there. "
###3490 In the Pittsburg Review...
###3491 "I have not, to this day, seen a single drop of blood. Not a drop."
###3497 It would seem that, on one day, for the second time in history,
###3502 an entire plane, along with its passengers, disappeared upon impact.
###3506 " ... No signs of any survivors at the site of the Nigerian plane crash "
###3509 " that is the word from the Red Cross, which has a representative on site. "
###3513 " The first pictures of the crash scene show a large crater where the Boeing 737 broke into the small pieces. "
###3519 " The plane crashed shortly after taking off from Lagos in a heavy storm. "
###3522 " The flight was going to the Nigerian capital of Abuja and was believed to be carrying some senior Nigerian officials."
###3530 So if Flight 93 didn't go down in Shanksville, then where?
###3533 You ready for this?  Cleveland.
###3536 At 11:43 on September 11th, WCPO, a local TV station in Cincinatti, Ohio,
###3541 reported that two planes landed at Cleveland Hopkins Airport due to a bomb threat.
###3546 United Airlines identified one of the planes as Flight 93.
###3550 Are you confused?  Well, it gets better. Check it out.
###3554 At approximately 10 AM, Cleveland Hopkins Airport was evacuated, amidst rumors that a hijacked plane was going to land.
###3563 Passengers had to leave, but couldn't drive. They had to walk or hitchhike.
###3570 Buses weren't allowed to leave. People were sent home.
###3577 According to Associated Press and local Ohio papers, one plane landed at approximately 10:45.
###3587 But Delta Airlines confirmed that their plane, Delta 1989, landed in Cleveland at 10:10.
###3593 Therefore, Flight 93 landed at Cleveland at approximately 10:45.
###3597 Authorities searched Delta 1989 for over two hours, and passengers were questioned individually.
###3603 The Plain Dealer reported that the plane was evacuated at 12:30.
###3607 But the Akron Beacon reports that a plane was evacuated at 11:15. Which would make that Flight 93.
###3613 Mayor White reported that the plane had 200 passengers.
###3618 But a passenger from Delta 1989 describes "60 or so" passengers.
###3622 So at 11:15, 200 or so passengers were released from Flight 93.
###3627 The passenger from Delta 1989 states that she was taken into FAA headquarters.
###3631 But other reports say that passengers were brought into the NASA Glenn Research Center
###3636 located near the west end of the airport, which had already been evacuated.
###3641 So, to sum up.
###3642 Delta 1989 landed at 10:10, was evacuated at 12:30,
###3646 almost two and a half hours later, and 69 passengers were taken to FAA Headquarters.
###3654 Flight 93 landed at 10:45 and evacuated within a half hour,
###3660 200 or so passengers quickly taken to an empty NASA Research Center.
###3665 Why did it take 140 minutes to evacuate 69 passengers, when 200 were evacuated in a half hour?
###3673 We can assume that the passengers from Delta 1989 are safe somewhere.
###3676 The question remains, what happened to the 200 or so passengers from Flight 93?
###3682 It's interesting to note that the combined total of all the passengers from all four flights is 198.
###3687 Or 243. Depending on who you ask.
###3692 We may never know what really happened to Flight 93.
###3695 But we do know what didn't happen.
###3729 Whenever this evidence is presented to people, you'll usually get one of many different questions.
###3736 The first one being, if different planes were used, what happened to the original ones?
###3741 Unfortunately, we may never know what really happened.
###3745 But if we could examine the black boxes from the planes that were used,
###3748 we could prove that they weren't the original flights.
###3753 A commercial plane carries two different black boxes.
###3756 Each black box carries one of two different recorders, a cockpit voice recorder and a flight data recorder.
###3762 The cockpit voice recorder records sounds from inside the cockpit, including engine noise, stall warnings, and other sounds of interest.
###3770 Communications between Air Traffic Control, weather briefings and conversations between pilots and crew are also recorded.
###3777 The flight data recorder records at least 28 different parameters such as time, altitude, speed and heading.
###3783 Some also record more than 300 other in flight characteristics, anything from auto-pilot to smoke alarms.
###3791 The recorders themselves are made from the most impervious metals known to man,
###3795 and the information is recorded along with date and time, and spooled into a continuous roll.
###3799 Any damage that is done to the roll is done to the outside, as opposed to the inside where the data is.
###3806 The 9-11 Commission says "The CVRs and FDRs from American 11 and United 175 were not found..."
###3814 Yet, the FBI claims to have found the passport of Satam al-Suqami, which managed to fly out of his pocket,
###3820 through the explosion and onto the streets of Manhattan below.
###3825 So, four different black boxes, made from the most resiliant materials known to man, were destroyed.
###3831 Yet, a passport, made from a fragile material known as paper, managed to survive?
###3837 Who writes this stuff?
###3840 Ted Lopatkiewicz, spokesman for the National Transportation Safety Board, told CBS News that
###3844 "It's extremely rare that we don't get the recorders back. I can't recall another domestic case in which we did not recover the recorders."
###3853 Turns out Ted's right.  Nicholas DeMasi, a firefighter who helped the recovery efforts claims in the book
###3858 Behind the Scenes: Ground Zero, "At one point I was assigned to take Federal Agents around the site
###3863 to search for the black boxes from the planes. There were a total of four black boxes. We found three."
###3869 I guess it all comes down to who you'd rather believe.
###3873 FBI Director Robert Mueller said Flight 77's data recorder provided altitude,
###3878 speed, headings and other information, but the voice recorder contained nothing useful.
###3882 And Donald Rumsfeld said the data on the cockpit voice recorder was unrecoverable.
###3889 As for Flight 93, it was the only flight where the cockpit voice recorded was recovered.
###3893 It was played for the families in April, 2002, but not before they signed an agreement saying that they wouldn't talk about it.
###3899 They couldn't even take notes.
###3901 And for some reason, the last three minutes of the tape was unaccounted for.
###3905 The FBI had no explanation for the discrepancy.
###3909 Why would the 9-11 Commission tell us Flight 11 and 175's recorders weren't found?
###3914 Why would Robert Mueller tell us that there's nothing interesting on Flight 77s?
###3918 What's on the last three minutes of Flight 93's CVR?
###3922 These are vital questions that need to be answered.
###3926 It's an interesting postscript that Flight 93 was spotted on April 10th, 2003 at Chicago's O'Hare Airport,
###3932 by David Friedman, a United Airlines employee who records all of his flights.
###3936 The tail number, N591UA was spotted on Flight 1111, a United Airlines 757.
###3945 And according the FAA, both N591UA and N612UA, Flights 93 and 175, are still valid.
###3954 But Flights 11 and 77 are listed as destroyed.
###3960 Not to mention that they were not even scheduled to fly on September 11th.
###3968 Next.  What about the cell phone calls?
###3972 For starters, the calls themselves are extremely peculiar.
###3975 Most of them are only a couple sentences long, before the callers end the conversation, only to call back later.
###3982 Flight Attendant Betty Ong allegedly placed a call from Flight 11.
###3986 According to the 9-11 Commission, although the conversation lasted 23 minutes, only 4 and a half minutes was recorded.
###3992 " What is your name? " " Ok, my name is Betty Ong. "
###3995 " I'm number 3 on Flight 11. " " Okay. "
###3999 " And the cockpit is not answering their phone. And there's somebody stabbed in business class. "
###4005 " And there's... we can't breathe in business class. Somebody's got mace or something. "
###4009 " Okay. Our number 1 got stabbed. Our purser is stabbed. "
###4015 " Nobody knows who is stabbed who, and we can't even get up to business class right now cause nobody can breathe. "
###4020 " Our number 1 is stabbed right now. And who else is... "
###4024 "Okay, and do we... " " and our number 5 - our first class passengers are - "
###4027 " galley flight attendant and our purser has been stabbed. And we can't get into the cockpit, the door won't open. "
###4036 Does Ms. Ong sound like a woman on a hijacked plane who just saw three people murdered?
###4041 Why is nobody in the background screaming?
###4044 Flight attendant Madeline Sweeney allegedly talked with her ground manager Michael Woodward for 25 minutes.
###4050 She describes 4 hijackers. The FBI says there were 5.
###4053 She says the hijackers were in rows 9 and 10. The FAA says there were all in row 8.
###4059 Near the end, she screams, "I see buildings.  Water. Oh my God!"
###4065 Madeline was a flight attendant out of Boston for 12 years. I think she would have recognized Manhattan.
###4071 A man claiming to be Mark Bingham called his mother, Alice, who was visiting his sister-in-law.
###4076 The caller says, "Mom? This is Mark Bingham."
###4079 When was the last time you called your mother and used your full name?
###4083 " I just want to tell you that I love you. I'm on a flight from Newark to San Francisco "
###4087 " and there are three guys on board and they have taken over the plane and they say they have a bomb. "
###4091 " I'm calling you from the Airfone,"  and then " You believe me, don't you, Mom? "
###4096 " Yes Mark, I believe you, who are these guys? "
###4099 Then he was interrupted by someone who was speaking in a low-toned male voice, speaking what sounded like English.
###4105 After 30 seconds of muffled sounds, the caller repeats " I'm calling you with an Airfone. "
###4110 His mother asks him again, " Who are these guys? "
###4113 After another pause he returns and asks again, " You believe me, don't you, Mom? "
###4117 There was another pause, and the phone just trailed off.
###4121 To date, none of the calls, except for Betty Ong's call to American Airlines, has been released to the public.
###4127 But to be honest, none of that matters.
###4130 Why? Because none of these calls could have taken place.
###4133 Kee Dewdney of Physics911.net conducted some research of his own.
###4139 In an experiment called Project Achilles, he took a series of cell phones onto a Cessna 172
###4144 and flew up to 8,000 feet to determine the success rate as the plane got higher.
###4148 At 4,000 feet he had a .4 success rate. At 8,000 feet he had a .1 success rate.
###4155 For 32,000 feet, cruising altitude for a commercial airliner, he calculated a .006 success rate.
###4163 less than one in a hundredth of a chance.
###4166 Don't believe me?  Even American Airlines has put their foot in the government's mouth.
###4170 On July 15th, 2004, passengers aboard a commercial American Airlines flight were able to send
###4175 and receive calls from their cell phones as if they were on the ground, thanks to a cell station that was installed into the plane.
###4182 " It worked great. I called the office. I called my wife. I called a friend in Paris. "
###4187 " They all heard me great, and I could hear them loud and clear."
###4190 Why would American Airlines spend thousands of dollars on this technology in 2004
###4195 when cell phones worked so well on September 11th, 2001?
###4199 The cell phone calls were fake. No question about it.
###4202 So how is it possible to fake a person's voice?
###4205 In 1999, the Los Alamos Laboratory in New Mexico revealed their voice morphing technology.
###4211 General Carl W. Steiner, the former Commander-in-chief of U.S. Special Operations declared on tape:
###4217 " Gentlemen! We have called you together to inform you that we are going to overthrow the United States government. "
###4222 Another example was Colin Powell saying, " I am being treated well by my captors. "
###4227 With just a 10-minute recording of somebody's voice, they are able, in almost real time, to clone someone's speech.
###4234 Steiner was so impressed, he asked for a copy.
###4238 So what about the hijackers?
###4241 On September 14th, 2001, the Department of Justice released the names of the alleged 19 hijackers.
###4246 But on September 23rd, the BBC reported that Waleed Al Shehri was alive and well in Casablanca, Morrocco.
###4255 They also tracked down Abdulaziz Alomari, who is an engineer with Saudi Telecoms, and lost his passport while studying in Denver.
###4262 In the same article, FBI Director Robert Mueller admitted that " the identity of several of the hijackers is in doubt."
###4269 So how many hijackers turned up alive? At least 9 of them.
###4273 Wail M. Alshehri is alive and well.
###4278 Mohand Alshehri is alive in Saudi Arabia.
###4282 Khalid Almihdhar is a computer programmer in Mecca.
###4286 Salem Alhazmi works at a chemical plant in Yanbu, Saudi Arabia.
###4291 Saeed Alghamdi is training to be a pilot in Tunis.
###4295 Ahmed Alnami is an administrative supervisor for Saudi Airlines.
###4299 We already covered Waleed and Abdulaziz.
###4302 And last but not least, Mohammed Atta's father claimed to receive a phone call from his son on September 12th.
###4308 On September 20th and 27th, Mueller admitted on CNN that there is "no legal proof to prove the identities of the hijackers" .
###4316 Indeed.  After all, not even the official autopsy for Flight 77 lists the hijackers,
###4323 and the opening paragraph makes no mention of their absence.
###4327 So if there's no proof that the hijackers were members of Al Qaeda or if they were even on the plane in the first place,
###4334 what justification do we have for bombing Afghanistan?
###4337 Oh, that's right. The Bin Laden confession tape.
###4343 On December 14th, 2001, the government released a tape, allegedly of bin Laden confessing to the attacks of 9/11,
###4350 which they claimed to find in a house in Jalalabad, Afghanistan.
###4354 Except there's a number of things wrong with this tape.
###4358 One, the tape itself is of very poor quality.
###4361 And two, the man in the video looks and acts nothing like bin Laden.
###4368 According to the FBI's website, Osama is left-handed.
###4375 Yet, in this video, he is writing a note with his right hand.
###4381 Not to mention he's wearing a gold ring, which is forbidden by Islamic law,
###4387 and is never mentioned in the FBI's description of him.
###4390 Compare this video to four other pictures of bin Laden.
###4395 Does anybody else see a problem here?
###4398 Until the government can prove without a shadow of a doubt that Al-Qaeda was behind September 11th,
###4403 the American people have every reason to believe otherwise.
###4439 And now for the last question of all.
###4442 Why would our government do such a thing?
###4446 I hope you're sitting down.
###4449 First, we have Larry Silverstein, the man who purchased the World Trade Center in July, 2001.
###4456 After September 11th, Silverstein demanded $7.2 billion dollars form his insurers,
###4461 claiming that each plane counted as a separate act of terrorism.
###4464 However, on December 6th, 2004, the courts only rewarded him with $2.2 billion dollars.
###4472 Next we have the put options that were placed on United Airlines, American Airlines, and Boeing.
###4477 According to the San Fransisco Chronicle, more than $2.5 Million dollars has remained unclaimed.
###4484 As for 9-11 itself...
###4487 Reuters reported that Convar, a German computer company,
###4490 is responsible for helping companies and accountants of New York to restore their data from over 400 hard drives,
###4496 that were recovered from the World Trade Center's rubble.
###4498 Convar recovered information from 32 different computers hat suggested insider trading took place on 9-11.
###4503 Richard Wagner, an expert at Convar,
###4506 " There is a suspicion that some people had advance knowledge of the approximate time of the plane crashes "
###4511 " in order to move out amounts exceeding 100 million dollars. "
###4515 " They thought that the records of their transactions could not be traced after the main frames were destroyed."
###4519 After their analysis, Convar handed the results over to the FBI.
###4523 Although the FBI was legally bound to investigate who was responsible, to date they have done no such thing.
###4530 Moving on. According to Wikipedia,
###4533 " One of the world's largest gold depositories was stored underneath the World Trade Center. "
###4537 In 1993 the value of the gold was estimated at one billion dollars, rumored to be owned by Kuwaiti interests.
###4545 When the World Trade Center was destroyed, the amount of gold "far exceeded the 1993 levels."
###4550 " The gold was finally recovered in its entirety in late 2001. "
###4555 Or was it?
###4557 On November 1st, 2001, the TimesOnline reported that a large amount of gold was discovered in the wreckage of the World Trade Center.
###4563 Mayor Rudolph Guiliani announced that more than $230 million dollars was recovered from Ground Zero.
###4569 However, the Comex metals trading division was storing gold bars for the Bank of Nova Scotia, Chase Manhattan Bank,
###4575 the Bank of New York, Hong Kong, and Shanghai Banking, totaling $950 million dollars.
###4580 And that's just one company.
###4584 Rumor has it that over $160 billion dollars in gold were stored in the World Trade Center.
###4589 So where did all the gold go?
###4593 Remember the gold that was found in November, 2001?
###4596 Reuters reported, that it was discovered in the back of a 10 wheel truck,
###4599 along with several cars in a delivery tunnel underneath World Trade Center 5.
###4604 No bodies were recovered.
###4606 As workers got closer to the gold, authorities began restricting access to Ground Zero,
###4611 joined by FBI and Secret Service agents.
###4614 One worker who was directed away from the tunnel told a reporter, " If I tried to go down there, they would have shot me. "
###4621 Heavy-machinery operators and others worked under the watchful eye of more than 100 armed officers.
###4628 So, let me get this straight.
###4630 Gold from WTC4 was found underneath WTC5, in an empty delivery truck, with an empty escort of cars.
###4638 I think it's safe to say that they were running away from the South Tower.
###4642 The question is, how did they know to flee from their stash, when not even the firefighters inside the South Tower expected it to collapse?
###4649 167 billion dollars in gold.  200 million is found.
###4653 And that's just the money.
###4656 After September 11th, President Bush had and continues to have permission to do and say whatever he wants,
###4661 all under the pretext of 9-11.
###4664 The Patriot Act.
###4667 The Department of Homeland Security.
###4670 Afghanistan.
###4672 Iraq.
###4680 It's time for America to accept 9-11 for what it was:
###4683 A lie which killed thousands of people, only in turn killing hundreds of thousands more, to make billions upon trillions of dollars.
###4690 Are you angry yet?  You should be.
###4694 Every single attempt to investigate and uncover the truth behind 9-11 has been blackballed, ridiculed,
###4699 and harassed by both the government and media alike, for even daring to question the official story.
###4703 " Jimmy Walter, you spent nearly 2 million dollars on an advertising blitz  "
###4707 " to convince people here in New York and elsewhere that 9-11 was a self-inflicted wound. "
###4712 " Jimmy, welcome. Why are you doing this? "
###4714 " I'm a patriot trying to defend this country from the real terrorists, "
###4718 " who have damaged and changed our country. I am asking the same questions "
###4723 " that the widows and orphans, parents and friends of the victims of 911 are asking, "
###4729 " and have not had answered by either the 911 comission, nor by any real investigation "
###4734 " to the mass murders, that 66% of New Yorkers want investigated. "
###4741 I'll say it again.  Why are they hiding from us? What are they hiding from us?
###4746 And what's it going to take until people in this country give a damn and do something about it?
###4750 America has been hijacked. Not by Al Qaeda. Not by Osama bin Laden.
###4755 But by a group of tyrans, ready and willing to do whatever it takes to keep their stranglehold on this country.
###4760 So what are we going to do about it?
###4762 Anything.  Share this information with friends, family, total strangers.
###4767 Hold screenings, conferences, whatever you have to do to get the word out.
###4771 It's up to you.
###4773 Ask questions.  Demand answers.
