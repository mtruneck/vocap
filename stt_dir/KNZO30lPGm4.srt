No real paperwork was exchanged,

It was about half price.

have certain permits for.


238
0:10:13,61 --> 0:10:15,41
I've got a suppressor
on a gun on a wall.


239
0:10:15,41 --> 0:10:16,31
You have to fill out a form.


240
0:10:16,31 --> 0:10:17,28
It goes to ATF.


241
0:10:17,28 --> 0:10:18,47
It's a $200 tax stamp.


242
0:10:18,47 --> 0:10:19,57
They do a background check.


243
0:10:19,57 --> 0:10:20,99
They send you the stamp.


244
0:10:20,99 --> 0:10:22,103
You're allowed to own it.

And what are some of the
other classifications?


247
0:10:24,42 --> 0:10:25,7
Like a Class 3 license,
what would that mean?


248
0:10:25,7 --> 0:10:27,84
JOHN BUCHAN: Well, fully
automatic machine guns, fully


249
0:10:27,84 --> 0:10:29,97
automatic weapons is a whole
different license.


250
0:10:29,97 --> 0:10:32,6
Transferring those weapons,
there's regulations for all of

difficult to get a group of
people in Washington to sit

down, maybe hook up with some
people from the NRA, and set


263
0:10:52,88 --> 0:10:56,94
up districts and set gun laws
that are made by gun owners


264
0:10:56,94 --> 0:10:58,14

industry.

ROCCO CASTORO: In 2004, the
Department of Justice released


271
0:11:14,12 --> 0:11:16,75
an assessment of the decade-long
ban that said, if


272
0:11:16,75 --> 0:11:19,35
the ban were to be reinstated at
a future date, its effects


273
0:11:19,35 --> 0:11:22,15
on gun violence are likely to be
small at best, and perhaps


274
0:11:22,15 --> 0:11:24,33
too small for reliable
measurement.


275
0:11:24,33 --> 0:11:27,33
The report also stated that
assault weapons were rarely


276
0:11:27,33 --> 0:11:29,275
used in gun crimes even
before the ban.


277
0:11:29,275 --> 0:11:31,93
A dissenting study carried out
by the Brady Center for Gun


278
0:11:31,93 --> 0:11:34,665
Control alleged that data
provided by the ATF showed


279
0:11:34,665 --> 0:11:36,85
that the number of violent
crimes in which assault


280
0:11:36,85 --> 0:11:42,32
weapons were used dropped from
4.82% to 1.61% during the ban.


281
0:11:42,32 --> 0:11:45,53
An ATF spokesperson later said
that his organization could,


282
0:11:45,53 --> 0:11:48,35
in no way, vouch for the
validity of that claim.

0:11:57,94 --> 0:12:0,6
Federal Firearms License
holders.


286
0:12:0,6 --> 0:12:2,84
The process for obtaining an FFL
and what types of weapons


287
0:12:2,84 --> 0:12:5,28
can be bought and sold by those
who are issued them is


288
0:12:5,28 --> 0:12:8,82
largely defined by 1938's
Federal Firearms Act and the


289
0:12:8,82 --> 0:12:13,22
gun Control Act of 1968.


290
0:12:13,22 --> 0:12:15,84
The ATF issues and oversees
licensing criteria for


291
0:12:15,84 --> 0:12:18,22

other people who have


292
0:12:18,22 --> 0:12:20,1
legitimate business with guns.


293
0:12:20,1 --> 0:12:22,4

largely stops at the

JOHN BUCHAN: Well, first
things first.


296
0:12:24,91 --> 0:12:27,3
When you open a store up, ATF
gives you the first right to


297
0:12:27,3 --> 0:12:29,9
decline a sale to any individual
for any reason.


298
0:12:29,9 --> 0:12:31,2
And we practice that here.

ROCCO CASTORO: High Noon, like
many other gun shops in the


408
0:17:20,94 --> 0:17:24,15
state, offers Concealed Weapon
Permit Certification classes.


409
0:17:24,15 --> 0:17:26,4
They are overseen by Tom
Dusseau, a local police


410
0:17:26,4 --> 0:17:29,15
officer, former Marine, and
private military contractor.


411
0:17:29,15 --> 0:17:30,47
TOM DUSSEAU: Well, essentially,
the state of


412
0:17:30,47 --> 0:17:33,39
Florida requires that you take
an NRA approved course.


413
0:17:33,39 --> 0:17:36,14
But what a lot of the
instructors are lacking is


414
0:17:36,14 --> 0:17:40,12
the, say, for lack of a better
term, the real life experience


415
0:17:40,12 --> 0:17:41,76
when it comes to being
involved in a


416
0:17:41,76 --> 0:17:43,44
confrontational situation.


417
0:17:43,44 --> 0:17:47,65
You look at the weapons and
how other people perceive


418
0:17:47,65 --> 0:17:50,54
them, and that's what it is,
it's perception, when you have


419
0:17:50,54 --> 0:17:55,88
a list of people, politicians,
whatever the case may be,


420
0:17:55,88 --> 0:17:59,12
picking weapons to put on an
assault weapons banned list,


421
0:17:59,12 --> 0:18:1,325
just because they look evil.


422
0:18:1,325 --> 0:18:3,75
EDDIE CACCIOLA: You can make
anything look badass.


423
0:18:3,75 --> 0:18:4,9
Some have a wooden stock.


424
0:18:4,9 --> 0:18:6,96
Some have a composite stock.


425
0:18:6,96 --> 0:18:10,5
Obviously, the composite stock
looks like somebody's coming


426
0:18:10,5 --> 0:18:10,925
to hurt you.


427
0:18:10,925 --> 0:18:14,325
And the other one reminds me
of my grandfather's rifle.


428
0:18:14,325 --> 0:18:17,62
TOM DUSSEAU: Does that make it
a war-type or assault weapon?


429
0:18:17,62 --> 0:18:18,5
Not really.


430
0:18:18,5 --> 0:18:19,52
It's a design.


431
0:18:19,52 --> 0:18:21,95
After the first election when
Obama was elected, I was


432
0:18:21,95 --> 0:18:23,4
teaching Concealed Weapons
classes in


433
0:18:23,4 --> 0:18:24,53
the state of Florida.


434
0:18:24,53 --> 0:18:26,42
A big class prior
to the election


435
0:18:26,42 --> 0:18:28,82
was eight to 10 people.


436
0:18:28,82 --> 0:18:32,31
After the election, every time
I'd walk in there, there was


437
0:18:32,31 --> 0:18:34,49
25 to 30 people.


438
0:18:34,49 --> 0:18:35,52
The people are running
in panic.


439
0:18:35,52 --> 0:18:37,11
They know the restrictions
are coming.


440
0:18:37,11 --> 0:18:39,59
They come out and they buy a
large number of firearms.


441
0:18:39,59 --> 0:18:40,75
And then they just put
them in a safe.


442
0:18:40,75 --> 0:18:41,63
They don't carry them.


443
0:18:41,63 --> 0:18:42,82
They don't use them.


444

ROCCO CASTORO: On a Saturday
following the shooting of 28


454
0:19:25,24 --> 0:19:27,74
people at an elementary school
in Newtown, Connecticut,


455
0:19:27,74 --> 0:19:31,57
Virginia State Police processed
4,166 background


456
0:19:31,57 --> 0:19:34,9
checks for concealed and
assault-type weapons, a 42%


457
0:19:34,9 --> 0:19:37,58
increase from the same
Saturday in 2011.


458
0:19:37,58 --> 0:19:40,33
On the same day, Colorado, a
state still reeling from a


459
0:19:40,33 --> 0:19:44,18
string of recent shootings,
also processed 4,200


460
0:19:44,18 --> 0:19:46,37
background checks, the highest
number since the


461
0:19:46,37 --> 0:19:48,96
program began in 1999.


462
0:19:48,96 --> 0:19:50,99
The fallout resulting from the
shooting at Sandy Hook


463
0:19:50,99 --> 0:19:54,79
Elementary has led to a 19%
rise in background checks


464
0:19:54,79 --> 0:19:55,78
nationwide.


465
0:19:55,78 --> 0:19:58,95
According to the FBI,
approximately 2.78 million


466
0:19:58,95 --> 0:20:0,77
background checks were recorded
in the month of


467
0:20:0,77 --> 0:20:2,48
December 2012 alone.


468
0:20:2,48 --> 0:20:7,2
That's a 39% rise from
the previous month.


469
0:20:7,2 --> 0:20:9,1
In recent years, there has been
much renewed attention


470
0:20:9,1 --> 0:20:11,53
paid to some of the more
nebulous aspects of many


471
0:20:11,53 --> 0:20:12,69
states' gun laws.


472
0:20:12,69 --> 0:20:14,7
Particular attention has been
paid to what is called the


473
0:20:14,7 --> 0:20:17,2
"stand your ground" law, the
guiding principle behind


474
0:20:17,2 --> 0:20:19,99
"stand your ground" being that
any person in public, if they


475
0:20:19,99 --> 0:20:22,56
feel as if their life has been
threatened, has the right to


476
0:20:22,56 --> 0:20:24,61
shoot that threat
dead on the spot


477
0:20:24,61 --> 0:20:26,54
without any duty to retreat.


478
0:20:26,54 --> 0:20:28,9
"Stand your ground" became a
household phrase following an


479
0:20:28,9 --> 0:20:31,32
incident in Florida in which the
threat in question was an


480
0:20:31,32 --> 0:20:34,32
unarmed, black 17-year-old with
nothing in his pockets


481
0:20:34,32 --> 0:20:35,63
but a bag of Skittles.


482
0:20:35,63 --> 0:20:38,55
That boy's name was
Trayvon Martin.


483
0:20:38,55 --> 0:20:40,67
There are currently 24 states
with "stand your


484
0:20:40,67 --> 0:20:42,6
ground" laws in effect.


485
0:20:42,6 --> 0:20:44,69
New research indicates that
states with "stand your


486
0:20:44,69 --> 0:20:47,87
ground" laws have a 7% to 9%
higher homicide rate, compared


487
0:20:47,87 --> 0:20:49,87
to states without such laws.


488
0:20:49,87 --> 0:20:52,43
Another aspect of firearms laws
currently under scrutiny


489
0:20:52,43 --> 0:20:55,8
in Washington is the ability to
purchase certain types of


490
0:20:55,8 --> 0:20:58,29
weapons at gun shows, pop-up
shops, or through private


491
0:20:58,29 --> 0:20:59,21

and tactfully looked it
over and made sure


514
0:21:38,61 --> 0:21:39,645
it was what it was.

585
0:23:53,215 --> 0:23:53,79
ROCCO CASTORO: Did it
feel like you were


586
0:23:53,79 --> 0:23:54,87
making a drug deal?


587
0:23:54,87 --> 0:23:55,723
EDDIE CACCIOLA: Kind
of, actually.


588
0:23:55,723 --> 0:23:56,156
ROCCO CASTORO: Yeah?


589
0:23:56,156 --> 0:23:56,589
Yeah?


590
0:23:56,589 --> 0:23:58,51
[LAUGHS]


591
0:23:58,51 --> 0:23:59,53
Why don't you show
us what you got?


592
0:23:59,53 --> 0:24:6,2
EDDIE CACCIOLA: A little Sig
P238, a little compact carry


593
0:24:6,2 --> 0:24:11,585
piece, perfect for,
maybe, the pocket.


594
0:24:11,585 --> 0:24:15,61
ROCCO CASTORO: Put it in your
belt or something like that.


595
0:24:15,61 --> 0:24:16,86
It's a nice weight.


596
0:24:16,86 --> 0:24:21,181



597
0:24:21,181 --> 0:24:23,105
EDDIE CACCIOLA: He didn't
ask me for anything.


598
0:24:23,105 --> 0:24:24,325
ROCCO CASTORO: Not even an ID?


599
0:24:24,325 --> 0:24:24,945
EDDIE CACCIOLA: No.


600
0:24:24,945 --> 0:24:26,455
ROCCO CASTORO: Didn't
even ask for an ID?


601
0:24:26,455 --> 0:24:26,671
EDDIE CACCIOLA: No.


602
0:24:26,671 --> 0:24:28,316
ROCCO CASTORO: What kind of
guy did he seem like?


603
0:24:28,316 --> 0:24:30,21
EDDIE CACCIOLA: Ah, a
little questionable.


604
0:24:30,21 --> 0:24:31,91
ROCCO CASTORO: A
little quacky?


605
0:24:31,91 --> 0:24:33,34
Did he think that was weird?


606
0:24:33,34 --> 0:24:34,15
Did he hesitate at all?


607
0:24:34,15 --> 0:24:35,94
EDDIE CACCIOLA: He was
a little hesitant.


608
0:24:35,94 --> 0:24:37,973
ROCCO CASTORO: But then he was
like, fuck it, I got the cash?


609
0:24:37,973 --> 0:24:38,92
EDDIE CACCIOLA: Yeah.


610
0:24:38,92 --> 0:24:40,23
He was like, ah, OK.


611
0:24:40,23 --> 0:24:44,69
Once he signed his name and I
signed my name, he said this


612
0:24:44,69 --> 0:24:47,844
is a legal binding contract.


613
0:24:47,844 --> 0:24:49,95
ROCCO CASTORO: Is it notarized?


614
0:24:49,95 --> 0:24:54,113
[LAUGHS]


615
0:24:54,113 --> 0:24:58,406
[MUSIC PLAYING]


616
0:24:58,406 --> 0:25:0,58
ROCCO CASTORO: Just like
abortion, gay marriage, and


617
0:25:0,58 --> 0:25:3,4
other hot-button legal issues,
it is nearly impossible to


618
0:25:3,4 --> 0:25:4,98
convince someone that
his or her opinion


619
0:25:4,98 --> 0:25:6,84
about guns is wrong.


620
0:25:6,84 --> 0:25:9,1
Even if somehow, in some
bizarro dimension where


621
0:25:9,1 --> 0:25:12,34
martial law has been declared,
the same people will keep


622
0:25:12,34 --> 0:25:14,43
stockpiling more and
more, until they


623
0:25:14,43 --> 0:25:16,34
are no longer available.


624
0:25:16,34 --> 0:25:18,23
Outside of stricter regulations
on background


625
0:25:18,23 --> 0:25:20,22
checks and keeping guns out of
the hands of the mentally


626
0:25:20,22 --> 0:25:23,35
disturbed, there is no easy
answer to the firearms debate


627
0:25:23,35 --> 0:25:25,28
that will make everyone happy.
