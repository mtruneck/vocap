###1 De-evolving a chickenasaurus, more teaching of creation in the schools, and
###6 we get some email with a mysterious white powder in it.  All this and more
###9 coming right up - this is Genesis Week.

###63 Live science carried an interview with Dr. Jack Horner, famous paleontologist who
###68 was a consultant and inspiration for the characters in "Jurassic park".  Jack has
###73 decided he wants to pull a Jurassic park and make a modern day dinosaur.  But not
###79 in the way the movie showed - nope.  He wants to de-evolve a chicken back into a
###84 dinosaur - cause after all, as we all know, chickens are living dinosaurs.

###102 I have great respect for Dr. Horner, but his comments and the live science article
###105 were filled with incredible amounts of unfounded evolutionary propaganda and
###110 assumptions.  The first and foremost assumption being that birds evolved from
###114 dinosaurs! As I mentioned in passing last week, this
###118 is a typical evolutionary claim - complete with your average evolutionary thinker
###123 citing feathered dinosaurs as proof that dinosaurs evolved into birds. Until you
###130 point out that based on the evolutionarily assigned ages of the fossils, the
###134 evolutionary timeline is reversed. According to the evolutionary timeline,
###139 the feathered dinosaurs were evolving into un-feathered dinosaurs.  And let us
###144 not forget the Nature article from a few months back which ruffled a whole pile of
###148 feathers after reporting a cretaceous fossil duck!
###155 Ya, ya, I know - Jurassic and Cretaceous aren't the same time periods, but the
###159 word "Cretaceous" doesn't lend itself to humour.
###163  and we find completely modern bird fossils like protoavis in rocks that are
###168 allegedly older than the dinosaurs birds were supposed to have been evolved
###172 from! For these and many more reasons,
###174 prominent evolutionists like Alan Feduccia and Stors Olson do not believe birds
###180 evolved from dinosaurs. And this is ignoring other problems for
###184 the dino to bird hypothesis such as the fossil footprints from Nova Scotia -
###189 allegedly 350 million years old  - which sure look like fossil Ostrich tracks.
###197 In spite of the fact that you cannot be your Grandfather's father, among other
###201 problems, Horner embraces the dino-to-bird ancestry, and bases his
###206 proposition on this assumption. As Stephanie Pappas wrote in the
###210 LiveScience article,
###238 In other words, if chickens evolved from the dinosaurs, then the "plans" for the
###243 dinosaurs would still be left over in the chicken's DNA, and he's just gotta figure
###248 out how to throw the right switches to get the chicken to make dinosaur parts
###251 instead of chicken parts.
###253 Just what would that take?  Well, first you'd have turn off the switches that
###258 control the genes that make the chicken's bird-like hip, then you need to turn on the
###263 gene that makes a lizard's hip.  And doesn't it seem odd to you that the
###268 evolutionists would claim that birds evolved from the dinosaurs which have
###271 lizard hips, rather than the dinosaurs which have hips like a bird?  Like the
###277 hadrosaurs - they lay eggs like a bird, have bird-like hips, have a bill like a
###281 duck's bill, yet the evolutionists claim the birds evolved from the group of dinosaurs
###286 which involves T-rex (which has lizard hips), and the long necked, sauropod
###290 dinosaurs which are lot more like an elephant than anything!
###294 Then Jack's gotta locate and turn off the genes that produce feathers and turn on
###299 the genes that make scales. He's also gotta find the genes that turn off the wing
###304 formation and turn on the arm formation, find the genes that make the fourth digit
###310 on the wing turn off and turn on the first digit gene, etc...
###315 All I can say is "Good luck with that, let me know how it goes."
###319 But Horner calls upon the erroneous, long-discredited "science" of vestigial
###325 organs or parts, and embryonic recapitulation.  Haeckel's drawings were
###331 shown to be fraudulent 150 years ago, yet his drawings and false claims are simply
###337 dressed up in a different, nicer looking business suit and put in our textbooks.
###342 Horner quotes a classic example of this idea, specifically talking about the human
###346 "tail", saying:
###355 Hogwash!  It is nothing but a tall tale to call that a tail! It is not a tail, but a somite
###363 - developing organs, tissues, etc... Describing it as a "tail" is nothing less
###370 than evolutionary propaganda - in fact, it is misleading.
###373 David Coppedge over at Creation Evolution Headlines had this to say about
###378 the Horner and the live science article:
###406 I might also add that Horner is not just referring to Creationists as being
###410 "misinformed", but other evolutionists such as Alan Feduccia and Larry Martin.
###416 Horner is also ignoring oodles of evidence I have only mentioned in passing here, in
###421 order to embrace the dino-to-bird hypothesis.
###424 Of course,  as Coppedge pointed out: If you're going to de-evolve a chicken, why
###430 stop at the dinosaur?  If Horner's ludicrous assumptions were correct, then
###435 you could de-evolve a chicken into an amphibian, a fish, a worm, a protoplasm,
###443 etc...
###444 Stephanie Pappas also authored snother live science article, "New Year brings New
###450 attacks on evolution in schools."
###453 That's right, more whining over the introduction of legislative bills that either
###457 allow teaching of creation or critique of evolution in the public schools.  Eugenie
###463 Scott, Executive director of the National Center for Science Eradication was
###468 quoted by live science regarding Indiana's proposed bill to include creation science,
###509 Let's get one thing straight here: Evolutionism IS controversial.  The only
###514 reason evolutionism has survived in the schools is because it must hide behind
###519 lawyers, judges, and school policies. When was the last time you heard of a
###524 physicist seeking court protection for his theory to be taught in schools without
###529 scrutiny?  You haven't heard of it because it's moronic.  Either the theory stands or
###537 falls under scrutiny. But yet, this is precisely what evolution has required:
###543 Court protection from scrutiny. Why? Because evolution disintegrates under
###549 even minor scrutiny.
###552 Oh - and by the way, yes the supreme court said it was unconstituntional to
###555 force schools to teach creationary theories, however they also ruled it was
###559 not unconstitutional to permit such teaching.

###568 Wahoo! Mail for me?

###579 The last episode of Genesis week was launched into the #3 position of most
###583 discussed videos in science and technology within two days of posting it.
###587 Over 600 hate-filled, rabid comments were left which were quite revealing.  Feel the
###593 LOVE!  First of all, why were the skeptics so emotional? This is science - if I'm
###601 wrong about something, then correct me. Instead, what I got was a barrage of very
###606 personal and venomous attack. It seemed the only thing the skeptics
###610 agreed upon was that I was a flagrant liar for Jesus.  Besides being an incredibly
###617 presumptuous accusation, they couldn't seem to agree on what it was exactly that
###621 I was lying about!  Well, that just speaks volumes of the anti-creationist claims and
###627 false accusations. It was quite entertaining to watch the
###630 skeptics contradict themselves, and each other!  Go read the comments for
###634 yourself!  Then to add to that, mutliple people got downright angry at me for
###639 saying that birds evolved from dinosaurs. Uhhhh, hellloooo, it was an evolutionist
###644 who said that, not me - I was merely responding to the evolutionist.
###648 This is a lesson I learned many years ago when we held the skeptic's night at
###653 Carleton University in Ottawa, the first event of the week-long National Capital
###657 Creation Conference.  It was standing room only in the lecture hall, and for the
###662 next week, I heard from lots of people who had been to the skeptic's night -
###665 including people who were not creationists nor Bible believers - but they
###670 all said the same thing.  The one thing from the skeptic's night that convinced
###674 them the most that maybe - just maybe, the creationary thinkers were actually
###679 right, was the extreme emotional, irrational, and illogical behaviour and
###685 comments of the atheists and anti-creationists.  NObody does a better
###690 job of making the anti-creationists look bad than the anti-creationists do. And this
###696 is precisely why I leave the comments open on my videos, so the whooole world
###699 can see exactly what they are saying.
###703 This is typical of the quality of argumentation from the anti-creationist
###707 camp.  It's not difficult to point out the glaring errors in their claims, and if you
###711 pay attention, they themselves usually point out their own glaring errors for you
###715 - even contradicting themselves and each other.
###718 I'm not out to poke fun of people or just "prove them wrong" - but rather I want to
###724 search out and find the TRUTH - which I have personally found to be Jesus Christ,
###729 our Creator.  So why then such emotional and personal reaction? I'm only talking
###734 about scientific matters.  It's because these scientific matters point to a Creator,
###741 which these anti-creationists wish to reject and hate.  So the hatred and
###749 irrationality of rejecting their creator spills over on to me - and I'm okay with that.
###754 There's so much more I wanted to talk about this week, but I'm out of time. Join
###758 me next Thursday for the next episode of Genesis week, and remember to rant
