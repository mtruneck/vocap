1
0:0:10,92 --> 0:0:40,44
Un-shitting-believable.


2
0:0:40,44 --> 0:0:45,56
I'm Dr Khan's replacement. Dr Gill.


3
0:0:45,56 --> 0:0:49,2
You can call me Kester.


4
0:0:49,2 --> 0:0:54,4
- Is it Rachel?
- Rae.


5
0:0:54,4 --> 0:0:57,76
I told Dr Khan to ask you
to start keeping a diary.


6
0:0:57,76 --> 0:1:0,56
But you can't read it
because Dr Khan...


7
0:1:0,56 --> 0:1:2,4
I don't want to read it.


8
0:1:2,4 --> 0:1:10,84
It's private. It's for you.


9
0:1:10,84 --> 0:1:16,76
Are you always this quiet?


10
0:1:16,76 --> 0:1:19,32
You know, there's a theory


11
0:1:19,32 --> 0:1:22,28
that you can discern the majority
of a person's characteristics


12
0:1:22,28 --> 0:1:25,84
in the first five seconds
of meeting them.


13
0:1:25,84 --> 0:1:27,44
What do your instincts say about me?


14
0:1:27,44 --> 0:1:33,76
My instincts say that a bird
took a dump on your head.


15
0:1:33,76 --> 0:1:35,84
So...


16
0:1:35,84 --> 0:1:40,4
You survived the first week
still in one piece, I see.


17
0:1:40,4 --> 0:1:41,84
What have we been up to?


18
0:1:41,84 --> 0:1:44,44
Look, with Dr Khan,
we would just talk...


19
0:1:44,44 --> 0:1:49,28
I'm not Dr Khan.


20
0:1:49,28 --> 0:1:51,16
So...


21
0:1:51,16 --> 0:1:58,76
what have we been up to this week?


22
0:1:58,76 --> 0:2:2,88
Not much.


23
0:2:2,88 --> 0:2:8,36
Big lie. This week has, in fact,
been pretty momentous.


24
0:2:8,36 --> 0:2:14,0
Wednesday, 10th July, 1996.


25
0:2:14,0 --> 0:2:17,0
Freedom.


26
0:2:17,0 --> 0:2:21,48
Dear Diary, I'm 16,
I weigh 16.5 stone


27
0:2:21,48 --> 0:2:23,88
and I live in Lincolnshire.


28
0:2:23,88 --> 0:2:29,12
My interests include music, vegging
out and finding a fit boy...


29
0:2:29,12 --> 0:2:34,72
Oh, scratch that, any boy,
to quench my ever-growing horn.


30
0:2:34,72 --> 0:2:39,2
Unfortunately, I already have a
lover that makes me look pregnant.


31
0:2:39,2 --> 0:2:40,4
Food.


32
0:2:40,4 --> 0:2:44,44
But, well, there is a difference
between snacking and bingeing.


33
0:2:44,44 --> 0:2:48,4
And I don't binge any more.


34
0:2:48,4 --> 0:2:50,96
And if anyone ever finds this diary


35
0:2:50,96 --> 0:2:59,8
and reads it and comes to
the conclusion that I'm crazy...


36
0:2:59,8 --> 0:3:0,493
they'd be spot on.


37
0:3:0,493 --> 0:3:39,8

<font color="#3399CC">http://UKsubtitles.ru.</font>


38
0:3:39,8 --> 0:3:41,56
Go away. I'm not speaking
to you.


39
0:3:41,56 --> 0:3:42,8
Why not?


40
0:3:42,8 --> 0:3:47,64
You're abandoning me. You're leaving
me here with all the mentals.


41
0:3:47,64 --> 0:3:49,92
I'll be back for my sessions
all the time.


42
0:3:49,92 --> 0:3:51,84
You won't be back.


43
0:3:51,84 --> 0:3:53,64
You'll be off going to loads
of parties,


44
0:3:53,64 --> 0:3:55,32
boy parties.


45
0:3:55,32 --> 0:4:2,56
Tix, we both know that there are
zero cool people in Lincolnshire.


46
0:4:2,56 --> 0:4:17,88
Tissue, please, Skinny.


47
0:4:17,88 --> 0:4:21,92
Did you get a new toothbrush?


48
0:4:21,92 --> 0:4:24,2
I'm gonna miss you.


49
0:4:24,2 --> 0:4:28,48
'Poor, lovely, messed-up Tixy.'


50
0:4:28,48 --> 0:4:36,92
Here.


51
0:4:36,92 --> 0:4:49,12
Go.


52
0:4:49,12 --> 0:4:51,8
Hi, Rae.


53
0:4:51,8 --> 0:4:53,2
Hi.


54
0:4:53,2 --> 0:4:55,48
'Dr Nick Kassar,


55
0:4:55,48 --> 0:4:58,48
'expert moistener of lady gardens.


56
0:4:58,48 --> 0:5:3,36
'I wanna eat his face!'


57
0:5:3,36 --> 0:5:5,16
It's, erm... It's good for the skin.


58
0:5:5,16 --> 0:5:7,12
Yeah, I know, yeah.
I drink two litres a day.


59
0:5:7,12 --> 0:5:15,8
Problem is, it makes you go to the
loo every half hour.


60
0:5:15,8 --> 0:5:16,84
I'm getting picked up in 20 minutes.


61
0:5:16,84 --> 0:5:18,28
What a shame.


62
0:5:18,28 --> 0:5:19,48
Why is that?


63
0:5:19,48 --> 0:5:24,0
Because I never got a chance
to do a sex on you.


64
0:5:24,0 --> 0:5:25,2
Rae.


65
0:5:25,2 --> 0:5:26,76
Yeah.


66
0:5:26,76 --> 0:5:31,68
Don't get up to any mischief.


67
0:5:31,68 --> 0:5:34,4
Well, don't go changing!


68
0:5:34,4 --> 0:5:36,32
You keep drinking that water!


69
0:5:36,32 --> 0:5:42,28
'Oh, God. Why do I always say
such twattish things?'


70
0:5:42,28 --> 0:5:45,16
Four months locked away.


71
0:5:45,16 --> 0:5:46,88
Four months convincing people


72
0:5:46,88 --> 0:5:51,64
my finger is no longer on the
self-destruct button.


73
0:5:51,64 --> 0:5:56,36
Finally, I was leaving.


74
0:5:56,36 --> 0:6:20,8
Finally, I was free.


75
0:6:20,8 --> 0:6:21,4
I'm not ready.


76
0:6:21,4 --> 0:6:24,6
Where are you?
Outside.


77
0:6:24,6 --> 0:6:26,44
I'm freaking out.


78
0:6:26,44 --> 0:6:28,12
I'm having a freak-out.


79
0:6:28,12 --> 0:6:29,8
Just count to ten.


80
0:6:29,8 --> 0:6:31,64
I'm not strong enough
to make it on my own.


81
0:6:31,64 --> 0:6:34,8
You're not on your own. You've got
your mum and all your friends.


82
0:6:34,8 --> 0:6:37,96
My mum's a nightmare,
and I haven't got any friends.


83
0:6:37,96 --> 0:6:40,48
You're my friend.


84
0:6:40,48 --> 0:6:42,44
The pips are going.


85
0:6:42,44 --> 0:6:44,44
What if something really bad
happens?


86
0:6:44,44 --> 0:6:46,72
What if I have a proper freak-out,
what then?


87
0:6:46,72 --> 0:6:47,8
Just count to ten.


88
0:6:47,8 --> 0:7:1,68
Yeah, but...


89
0:7:1,68 --> 0:7:26,4
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.


90
0:7:26,4 --> 0:7:29,6
I'm sorry I was late.
It's only been ten minutes.


91
0:7:29,6 --> 0:7:30,24
40 minutes.


92
0:7:30,24 --> 0:7:31,96
Give over with your 40 minutes.


93
0:7:31,96 --> 0:7:39,28
You talk more random
than duck shite sometimes.


94
0:7:39,28 --> 0:7:40,4
D'you want one?


95
0:7:40,4 --> 0:7:41,92
When have I ever smoked?


96
0:7:41,92 --> 0:7:50,84
You might have started.


97
0:7:50,84 --> 0:8:2,36
Might have some Blue Ribands
in the glove box.


98
0:8:2,36 --> 0:8:5,84
No, no. I can't, love.
No, I'm on the alphabet diet.


99
0:8:5,84 --> 0:8:7,16
The what?


100
0:8:7,16 --> 0:8:9,84
Each week, you only eat food
beginning with a certain letter.


101
0:8:9,84 --> 0:8:14,4
Makes you rotate all your food types.
This week it's W.


102
0:8:14,4 --> 0:8:16,2
So, you've nearly done
the entire alphabet?


103
0:8:16,2 --> 0:8:19,6
No. I started on S, cos I bought
a load of Scotch eggs on the cheap.


104
0:8:19,6 --> 0:8:22,4
I've lost six pounds, though.


105
0:8:22,4 --> 0:8:24,4
That's, what, just over a month,


106
0:8:24,4 --> 0:8:26,48
month and a bit.


107
0:8:26,48 --> 0:8:28,68
Have Blue Ribands got wafer in it?


108
0:8:28,68 --> 0:9:16,88
Wafer begins with a W.


109
0:9:16,88 --> 0:9:20,36
Oh, no.


110
0:9:20,36 --> 0:9:21,96
Rae?


111
0:9:21,96 --> 0:9:23,4
Who's that?


112
0:9:23,4 --> 0:9:24,16
Chloe.


113
0:9:24,16 --> 0:9:25,32
Rae! Oh, my God!


114
0:9:25,32 --> 0:9:28,64
Chloe? Blood and stomach pills,
she's blossomed.


115
0:9:28,64 --> 0:9:37,96
Look at the chest.


116
0:9:37,96 --> 0:9:39,72
Please don't embarrass me.


117
0:9:39,72 --> 0:9:41,2
Oh, get over yourself.


118
0:9:41,2 --> 0:9:44,68
And don't be long. We're in a rush.


119
0:9:44,68 --> 0:9:46,92
Oh, my God! Come here!


120
0:9:46,92 --> 0:9:49,92
Why didn't you tell me you were
back? How was France?


121
0:9:49,92 --> 0:9:52,36
France?


122
0:9:52,36 --> 0:9:56,3
Yeah, it was great.
It was really nice.


123
0:9:56,3 --> 0:9:57,76
I can't believe you've been gone
three months.


124
0:9:57,76 --> 0:10:0,64
Four months.


125
0:10:0,64 --> 0:10:2,84
- Yeah, well...
- Rae!


126
0:10:2,84 --> 0:10:4,32
I'm glad you're back, anyway...


127
0:10:4,32 --> 0:10:9,4
Thanks.


128
0:10:9,4 --> 0:10:11,4
I should go.


129
0:10:11,4 --> 0:10:13,8
Oh, no, no, no. Listen, listen...


130
0:10:13,8 --> 0:10:16,8
Come to the pub tonight
with the gang.


131
0:10:16,8 --> 0:10:19,52
I've started hanging round with the
sixth formers from Wellesley Park.


132
0:10:19,52 --> 0:10:23,6
The guys are fit as, right?


133
0:10:23,6 --> 0:10:25,56
- And they're all single.
- Chop!


134
0:10:25,56 --> 0:10:27,28
So, please come, sweets.


135
0:10:27,28 --> 0:10:34,4
Please!


136
0:10:34,4 --> 0:10:39,36
'Yes, please...'


137
0:10:39,36 --> 0:10:40,12
Yeah?


138
0:10:40,12 --> 0:10:42,72
I mean, um, yeah...


139
0:10:42,72 --> 0:10:48,0
I'm a bit busy, but it would be cool
to hang out with you.


140
0:10:48,0 --> 0:10:50,44
In France, all I did was hang.
Definitely.


141
0:10:50,44 --> 0:10:53,88
I'd probably get withdrawal symptoms
if I stopped hanging.


142
0:10:53,88 --> 0:10:55,4
Yeah.


143
0:10:55,4 --> 0:11:6,56
Rae!


144
0:11:6,56 --> 0:11:9,0
Well, I'll see you later, then.


145
0:11:9,0 --> 0:11:12,6
Bye.


146
0:11:12,6 --> 0:11:14,4
France?!


147
0:11:14,4 --> 0:11:17,8
Well, I had to say something.
You told me not to tell anyone.


148
0:11:17,8 --> 0:11:18,48
France?!


149
0:11:18,48 --> 0:11:28,12
Why didn't you just say
I had glandular fever or summat?


150
0:11:28,12 --> 0:11:31,4
'Welcome to the house of pain.


151
0:11:31,4 --> 0:11:33,4
'Barely enough room for one person,


152
0:11:33,4 --> 0:11:35,36
'let alone me and her.


153
0:11:35,36 --> 0:11:40,28
'I'm not even in
and I wanna get out.'


154
0:11:40,28 --> 0:11:46,4
Come on, Rachel.
I've got something to show you.


155
0:11:46,4 --> 0:12:0,185
What?


156
0:12:0,185 --> 0:12:3,25
Rae, this is Karim.


157
0:12:3,25 --> 0:12:4,865
My lover.


158
0:12:4,865 --> 0:12:10,225
Isn't he something?


159
0:12:10,225 --> 0:12:14,975
Ohhh! Say hello! Say hello,
say hello.


160
0:12:14,975 --> 0:12:16,215
Pleased to meet you.


161
0:12:16,215 --> 0:12:18,895
Why were you in the boot?


162
0:12:18,895 --> 0:12:21,215
Oh... Well, he can't speak
much English.


163
0:12:21,215 --> 0:12:23,855
He speaks Arabic and French.


164
0:12:23,855 --> 0:12:26,55
That's what they speak in Tunisia.


165
0:12:26,55 --> 0:12:28,255
Er... Help...


166
0:12:28,255 --> 0:12:32,415
Right, who'd like a sticky waffle?


167
0:12:32,415 --> 0:12:35,295
Why was he in the chuffing boot?


168
0:12:35,295 --> 0:12:39,615
Look... Right, look.
He hasn't done anything wrong,


169
0:12:39,615 --> 0:12:41,255
but there are people looking for him.


170
0:12:41,255 --> 0:12:42,735
What people?
Immigration.


171
0:12:42,735 --> 0:12:46,463
He's not allowed to be here.
Not just yet. Not just for now.


172
0:12:46,463 --> 0:12:47,543
He, er...


173
0:12:47,543 --> 0:12:50,663
He ran away
from this holding place, and...


174
0:12:50,663 --> 0:12:53,23
we fell in love.


175
0:12:53,23 --> 0:12:55,23
Now, no-one can know about this.


176
0:12:55,23 --> 0:12:59,703
Not just for now. Is that OK, Rachel?


177
0:12:59,703 --> 0:13:0,823
Oh, Karim!


178
0:13:0,823 --> 0:13:2,703
Put me down, you bloody beast!


179
0:13:2,703 --> 0:13:6,783
Oh!


180
0:13:6,783 --> 0:13:9,903
There is a difference
between snacking and bingeing.


181
0:13:9,903 --> 0:13:28,623
And I don't binge any more.


182
0:13:28,623 --> 0:14:6,543
Ever feel like you're returning
to the scene of a crime?


183
0:14:6,543 --> 0:14:10,503
Oh, Damon. I love you,
but I've gotta get out of this house


184
0:14:10,503 --> 0:14:18,543
and meet some real boys.


185
0:14:18,543 --> 0:14:20,343
Right, look.


186
0:14:20,343 --> 0:14:23,143
Before you meet everyone,
just try and be cool, yeah?


187
0:14:23,143 --> 0:14:27,343
I could try and get you in with them,
but they're a pretty exclusive bunch,


188
0:14:27,343 --> 0:14:30,863
so... just don't be upset
if it doesn't happen.


189
0:14:30,863 --> 0:14:32,303
OK?
Yeah.


190
0:14:32,303 --> 0:14:33,423
You ready?
Yeah.


191
0:14:33,423 --> 0:14:34,543
Come on.


192
0:14:34,543 --> 0:14:36,63
Izzy.


193
0:14:36,63 --> 0:14:38,663
'Being in a pub is weird


194
0:14:38,663 --> 0:14:41,543
'when eight hours earlier
you were in a mental ward.


195
0:14:41,543 --> 0:14:45,263
'I felt like a criminal,
like a renegade,


196
0:14:45,263 --> 0:14:49,21
'like it was so obvious
I wasn't meant to be there.'


197
0:14:49,21 --> 0:14:50,115
Sorry, lover!


198
0:14:50,115 --> 0:14:52,515
'I felt alive.'


199
0:14:52,515 --> 0:14:54,315
Everyone, this is Rae.


200
0:14:54,315 --> 0:14:55,515
You all right?


201
0:14:55,515 --> 0:14:56,635
Hiya!
All right?


202
0:14:56,635 --> 0:14:58,475
Do you want a drink?
Cos Chop can get served.


203
0:14:58,475 --> 0:14:59,955
Er, no, it's all right.
I don't drink.


204
0:14:59,955 --> 0:15:1,555
Really?


205
0:15:1,555 --> 0:15:2,715
Yeah.


206
0:15:2,715 --> 0:15:4,475
Where's Archie?


207
0:15:4,475 --> 0:15:13,75
Somewhere.
He said he was coming, so...


208
0:15:13,75 --> 0:15:17,395
What are you doing, you benny?
You trying to get us kicked out?


209
0:15:17,395 --> 0:15:20,795
Here y'are. Make yourself useful
and take a picture


210
0:15:20,795 --> 0:15:23,555
of the biggest pythons
in sports entertainment.


211
0:15:23,555 --> 0:15:27,75
What, these ones?
Them ones or them ones?


212
0:15:27,75 --> 0:15:29,475
Here y'are.
Let me have a go.


213
0:15:29,475 --> 0:15:30,875
Archie, get up here!


214
0:15:30,875 --> 0:15:37,475
Archie, get up here!


215
0:15:37,475 --> 0:15:38,515
Cheers.

It's Rae.


278
0:19:28,115 --> 0:19:38,555
May, take a picture of us, will you?


279
0:19:38,555 --> 0:20:5,555
Chop, your guns
nearly don't fit in that picture!


280
0:20:5,555 --> 0:20:7,555
I've decided.


281
0:20:7,555 --> 0:20:11,595
There are three ways Archie
is gonna go out with me.


282
0:20:11,595 --> 0:20:14,835
One - if he's secretly
got a thing for big women,


283
0:20:14,835 --> 0:20:17,475
like Lenny Henry has
for Dawn French.


284
0:20:17,475 --> 0:20:19,555
Two - apocalyptic catastrophe


285
0:20:19,555 --> 0:20:22,35
takes out all of the women
on the Earth,


286
0:20:22,35 --> 0:20:25,195
and therefore my humps become
a precious commodity.


287
0:20:25,195 --> 0:20:35,995
Three - I feed him biscuits
until he's fat too.


288
0:20:35,995 --> 0:21:10,595
If this goes in the bin, Archie will
definitely sleep with me.


289
0:21:10,595 --> 0:21:12,195
I had to see you.


290
0:21:12,195 --> 0:21:16,915
What are you doing here?


291
0:21:16,915 --> 0:21:32,675
Let's not talk.


292
0:21:32,675 --> 0:21:35,195
Mmm. Kiss my neck, Archie.


293
0:21:35,195 --> 0:21:36,355
Please, for me.


294
0:21:36,355 --> 0:21:37,475
What?


295
0:21:37,475 --> 0:21:38,595
Please, I beg you.


296
0:21:38,595 --> 0:21:41,475
Why are you talking like that?


297
0:21:41,475 --> 0:21:43,35
Please.


298
0:21:43,35 --> 0:21:47,435
Oh, Karim!
Oh! Oh! Karim! Karim! Oh!


299
0:21:47,435 --> 0:21:50,475
Oh! Oh! Karim! Karim!


300
0:21:50,475 --> 0:21:52,155
Oh, my God!


301
0:21:52,155 --> 0:22:7,595
I...can't... believe it!


302
0:22:7,595 --> 0:22:8,475
What?


303
0:22:8,475 --> 0:22:12,355
Do you have any idea what time
it is?


304
0:22:12,355 --> 0:22:13,675
It's quarter to five.


305
0:22:13,675 --> 0:22:15,275
It's quarter to five.


306
0:22:15,275 --> 0:22:18,915
And I'm awake!


307
0:22:18,915 --> 0:22:21,995
What do you want? A chufty badge
and a round of applause?


308
0:22:21,995 --> 0:22:25,755
I want to go to sleep knowing that
I'm not gonna be woken up


309
0:22:25,755 --> 0:22:29,195
by the sound of you
getting your bones jumped.


310
0:22:29,195 --> 0:22:30,955
I beg your pardon?!


311
0:22:30,955 --> 0:22:33,595
Just stop having sex at top volume,
yeah?


312
0:22:33,595 --> 0:22:35,235
I didn't know we were being loud.


313
0:22:35,235 --> 0:22:38,635
There's people in Peterborough that
think the world's coming to an end.


314
0:22:38,635 --> 0:22:42,235
Oh, come on, Rachel. You talk more
random than duck shite sometimes.


315
0:22:42,235 --> 0:22:43,875
Will you just stop saying that?


316
0:22:43,875 --> 0:22:46,795
It's just stupid.


317
0:22:46,795 --> 0:22:50,195
You watch your tone with me,
young lady.


318
0:22:50,195 --> 0:22:52,595
You remember who you're talking to.


319
0:22:52,595 --> 0:22:54,875
D'you know what?


320
0:22:54,875 --> 0:22:56,795
'And then I said it.


321
0:22:56,795 --> 0:22:59,475
'The worst thing I've ever said
to my mum.


322
0:22:59,475 --> 0:23:1,955
'And, as I'm feeling mega guilty
anyway,


323
0:23:1,955 --> 0:23:5,155
'we might as well do the top three.'


324
0:23:5,155 --> 0:23:10,595
Mum, why's your bum bigger
than all the other mums' bums?


325
0:23:10,595 --> 0:23:13,675
Rachel... Earl!


326
0:23:13,675 --> 0:23:17,155
Come on.


327
0:23:17,155 --> 0:23:18,755
I wanted a Kylie one.


328
0:23:18,755 --> 0:23:21,235
Well, maybe I couldn't afford
a Kylie one.


329
0:23:21,235 --> 0:23:25,355
Maybe if you hadn't made Dad leave,
we'd be able to get nice things.


330
0:23:25,355 --> 0:23:29,915
Rachel... Earl!


331
0:23:29,915 --> 0:23:34,635
All right!


332
0:23:34,635 --> 0:23:36,675
It's no wonder I went mental, is it?


333
0:23:36,675 --> 0:23:39,555
When I've got the biggest screw-up


334
0:23:39,555 --> 0:23:44,355
in the history of screw-ups
for a parent.


335
0:23:44,355 --> 0:23:48,155
Go on. Say it.


336
0:23:48,155 --> 0:24:6,235
"Rachel Earl!"


337
0:24:6,235 --> 0:24:16,377
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, ten.


338
0:24:16,377 --> 0:24:21,137
Thursday, the 11th of July, 1996.


339
0:24:21,137 --> 0:24:25,897
No-one's called.


340
0:24:25,897 --> 0:24:27,982
I loved Thursdays in the hospital.


341
0:24:27,982 --> 0:24:29,542
In the mornings,


342
0:24:29,542 --> 0:24:31,206
me and Tix would catch up
on the charts


343
0:24:31,206 --> 0:24:32,806
and have toast.


344
0:24:32,806 --> 0:24:35,766
And in the afternoon, we'd have
group and then go out to the lake


345
0:24:35,766 --> 0:24:39,846
with Danny Two Hats
and play Ten Questions.


346
0:24:39,846 --> 0:24:43,606
But now, there's a new gang,
I suppose.


347
0:24:43,606 --> 0:24:47,206
But why haven't they called?


348
0:24:47,206 --> 0:25:9,206
Have I fucked it up already?


349
0:25:9,206 --> 0:25:13,166
Rae?


350
0:25:13,166 --> 0:25:14,606
What are you doing here?


351
0:25:14,606 --> 0:25:15,806
I was just passing.


352
0:25:15,806 --> 0:25:17,606
I thought I'd nip in.


353
0:25:17,606 --> 0:25:21,366
I would have rang to say we were all
coming down, but...


354
0:25:21,366 --> 0:25:23,326
it was kind of a spontaneous thing.


355
0:25:23,326 --> 0:25:26,886
You know how it is.


356
0:25:26,886 --> 0:25:30,646
Archie, put summat decent on
the jukebox, will you?


357
0:25:30,646 --> 0:25:33,606
'Music. My turf.


358
0:25:33,606 --> 0:25:36,86
'Go big or go home.'


359
0:25:36,86 --> 0:25:36,726
I'll do it.


360
0:25:36,726 --> 0:25:38,206
No, I want Archie to do it.


361
0:25:38,206 --> 0:25:39,966
He knows his music.


362
0:25:39,966 --> 0:25:41,86
I know my music.


363
0:25:41,86 --> 0:25:42,846
Look, May...
Rae.


364
0:25:42,846 --> 0:25:44,526
As in Raymond?
As in Rachel.


365
0:25:44,526 --> 0:25:48,886
Whatever. Rae, it's my 20p, and I
want Archie to do it, all right?


366
0:25:48,886 --> 0:26:1,726
If you don't like what I put on,
I'll give you your 20p back.


367
0:26:1,726 --> 0:26:5,726
It was time to drop the big guns.


368
0:26:5,726 --> 0:26:8,766
And I hereby present my case
for gang membership.


369
0:26:8,766 --> 0:26:16,646
Spin on that, Finn.


370
0:26:16,646 --> 0:26:19,686
Tune!


371
0:26:19,686 --> 0:26:20,646
Nice one!


372
0:26:20,646 --> 0:26:23,606
Yeah, it's not
bad... for mainstream.


373
0:26:23,606 --> 0:26:28,6
I don't think we've been introduced
properly. I'm Archie.


374
0:26:28,6 --> 0:26:29,366
Hi, Archie.


375
0:26:29,366 --> 0:26:32,766
'I'd shag him until there was
nothing left.


376
0:26:32,766 --> 0:26:37,326
'Just a pair of glasses
and a damp patch.'


377
0:26:37,326 --> 0:26:40,686
Rae, you're still coming to my party
on Saturday, right?


378
0:26:40,686 --> 0:26:41,726
Am I invited?


379
0:26:41,726 --> 0:26:45,886
Of course you are! Silly moo!


380
0:26:45,886 --> 0:26:47,246
Tell everyone!


381
0:26:47,246 --> 0:26:49,6
All right.


382
0:26:49,6 --> 0:26:51,766
Right, listen. As you all know,


383
0:26:51,766 --> 0:26:55,206
I am proper excited
about moving into my new house,


384
0:26:55,206 --> 0:26:59,566
so I am delighted to say that my
party on Saturday night


385
0:26:59,566 --> 0:27:1,686
will be my first ever...


386
0:27:1,686 --> 0:27:2,806
pool party.


387
0:27:2,806 --> 0:27:4,286
Whoo!


388
0:27:4,286 --> 0:27:10,966
Pool party? Get in there!


389
0:27:10,966 --> 0:27:12,926
Are you kidding me?!


390
0:27:12,926 --> 0:27:16,686
Who wants a snakebite?
Yeah, I do.


391
0:27:16,686 --> 0:27:18,766
Go on, you can do it!


392
0:27:18,766 --> 0:27:21,966
You can do it!


393
0:27:21,966 --> 0:27:26,406
Yes!


394
0:27:26,406 --> 0:27:32,126
'I am...'


395
0:27:32,126 --> 0:27:35,86
Friday, the 12th of July.


396
0:27:35,86 --> 0:27:38,366
My first hangover.


397
0:27:38,366 --> 0:27:43,566
I felt like an orang-utan
had been sick on my brain.


398
0:27:43,566 --> 0:27:48,886
The big question is,
one piece, bikini or monokini?


399
0:27:48,886 --> 0:27:55,86
Well, where's the makes-you-not-look
like-a-massive-bloater-kini?


400
0:27:55,86 --> 0:27:56,726
What?


401
0:27:56,726 --> 0:27:57,846
Nothing.


402
0:27:57,846 --> 0:28:3,766
Well, come on, try them on.


403
0:28:3,766 --> 0:28:6,566
'There was a time when I refused


404
0:28:6,566 --> 0:28:10,246
'to wear anything
other than a swimsuit.'


405
0:28:10,246 --> 0:28:15,446
Will you help me get a pasty,
please?


406
0:28:15,446 --> 0:28:18,446
You shouldn't eat too many of these,
you'll get fat.


407
0:28:18,446 --> 0:28:20,686
I don't care if I get fat.
They taste nice.


408
0:28:20,686 --> 0:28:24,86
But if you get fat,
you won't be able to wear a swimsuit


409
0:28:24,86 --> 0:28:25,766
and boys won't like you.


410
0:28:25,766 --> 0:28:27,46
I don't like boys.


411
0:28:27,46 --> 0:28:28,806
And even if I did like boys


412
0:28:28,806 --> 0:28:31,806
and I was fat and I wore a swimsuit,
they'd like me anyway.


413
0:28:31,806 --> 0:28:33,526
Why would they like you?


414
0:28:33,526 --> 0:28:35,286
Because I'm brilliant.


415
0:28:35,286 --> 0:28:40,406
Rae!


416
0:28:40,406 --> 0:28:43,846
'There's no fucking way
anyone's gonna see me in this.'


417
0:28:43,846 --> 0:28:54,726
Phhhhh...


418
0:28:54,726 --> 0:28:56,366
What are you doing?


419
0:28:56,366 --> 0:28:57,566
Burning one?


420
0:28:57,566 --> 0:28:58,646
But you don't smoke.


421
0:28:58,646 --> 0:29:0,126
Well, I started yesterday.


422
0:29:0,126 --> 0:29:6,406
You know, it keeps you thin.


423
0:29:6,406 --> 0:29:8,86
We're evacuating the store.
Yep.


424
0:29:8,86 --> 0:29:10,206
We really need to get out
of the store.


425
0:29:10,206 --> 0:29:11,886
If you need to cover yourself up
with this.


426
0:29:11,886 --> 0:29:14,206
What?
Excuse me, please. Thank you.


427
0:29:14,206 --> 0:29:21,27
Let's just go, thank you.


428
0:29:21,27 --> 0:29:24,59
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry, Rae.


429
0:29:24,59 --> 0:29:33,83
Just ignore them, Rae.


430
0:29:33,83 --> 0:29:36,83
Oi, Jabba! D'you want this burger?
I've lost my appetite.


431
0:29:36,83 --> 0:29:38,63
Rae?
Jabba, Jabba, Jabba!


432
0:29:38,63 --> 0:29:40,27
Oh, my God, no!
What's going on?


433
0:29:40,27 --> 0:29:42,11
Jabba, Jabba, Jabba!
What's going on?


434
0:29:42,11 --> 0:30:9,75
Just ignore them, Rae.


435
0:30:9,75 --> 0:30:12,79
One.


436
0:30:12,79 --> 0:30:14,47
Two.


437
0:30:14,47 --> 0:30:16,99
Three.


438
0:30:16,99 --> 0:30:20,87
Four. Five.


439
0:30:20,87 --> 0:30:22,99
Six.


440
0:30:22,99 --> 0:30:26,71
Seven.


441
0:30:26,71 --> 0:30:29,35
Eight.


442
0:30:29,35 --> 0:31:45,31
Nine.


443
0:31:45,31 --> 0:31:47,15
I'm back.


444
0:31:47,15 --> 0:31:49,39
I lasted, what?


445
0:31:49,39 --> 0:31:52,63
Two days?


446
0:31:52,63 --> 0:31:55,27
Something happened.


447
0:31:55,27 --> 0:32:0,43
It was so embarrassing.


448
0:32:0,43 --> 0:32:5,27
My skin feels itchy with it.


449
0:32:5,27 --> 0:32:8,67
I hate to think that people
would have gone home and...


450
0:32:8,67 --> 0:32:11,55
talked about it...


451
0:32:11,55 --> 0:32:14,19
like it was a joke...


452
0:32:14,19 --> 0:32:22,15
over their Yorkshire puddings
or summat.


453
0:32:22,15 --> 0:32:27,43
It's too much out there.


454
0:32:27,43 --> 0:32:32,71
I don't even know how to explain it.


455
0:32:32,71 --> 0:32:39,35
It smashes up all of your senses.


456
0:32:39,35 --> 0:32:55,51
I'm not strong enough
to deal with it all on my own.


457
0:32:55,51 --> 0:33:16,43
Tissue, please, Fatty.


458
0:33:16,43 --> 0:33:20,55
What are you doing here?


459
0:33:20,55 --> 0:33:22,789
I've, um...


460
0:33:22,789 --> 0:33:23,909
I've got some good news.


461
0:33:23,909 --> 0:33:25,469
What?


462
0:33:25,469 --> 0:33:28,14
Decided to come back.


463
0:33:28,14 --> 0:33:42,856
I just don't think I'm ready.


464
0:33:42,856 --> 0:33:44,216
What are you doing?


465
0:33:44,216 --> 0:33:49,845
Stop it! Stop it!


466
0:33:49,845 --> 0:33:53,245
Just stop it!


467
0:33:53,245 --> 0:33:56,845
Everyone in here is holding on to
their lives by their fingertips, Rae.


468
0:33:56,845 --> 0:34:0,46
And you get given a chance
to start again


469
0:34:0,46 --> 0:34:4,246
and you don't want it!


470
0:34:4,246 --> 0:34:6,566
I don't like it out there.


471
0:34:6,566 --> 0:34:12,846
No! You don't like it anywhere,
because you don't like yourself.


472
0:34:12,846 --> 0:34:15,286
You'd better start doing.


473
0:34:15,286 --> 0:34:19,86
Because I've been trying
to be more like you for months.


474
0:34:19,86 --> 0:34:24,446
And if there's no hope for you
then what hope is there for me?


475
0:34:24,446 --> 0:34:28,606
What if something bad happened,
something really bad?


476
0:34:28,606 --> 0:34:31,806
I tried counting to ten,
and it didn't work.


477
0:34:31,806 --> 0:34:39,206
Then you put on your Rae armour
and you charge at it.


478
0:34:39,206 --> 0:34:44,886
Promise me you won't come back.


479
0:34:44,886 --> 0:35:4,206
But I really miss you.


480
0:35:4,206 --> 0:35:10,6
So, the pool party.


481
0:35:10,6 --> 0:35:12,606
Turn up to a pool party with a bag
of booze nicked from your mum,


482
0:35:12,606 --> 0:35:16,926
and no-one'll care if you swim
or not.


483
0:35:16,926 --> 0:35:25,406
But how to escape?


484
0:35:25,406 --> 0:35:34,246
Ah!


485
0:35:34,246 --> 0:35:36,686
Jesus, Rae!


486
0:35:36,686 --> 0:35:40,456
You've bloody ruined my flowerbeds.


487
0:35:40,456 --> 0:35:46,675
All right, all right.


488
0:35:46,675 --> 0:35:48,155
You smell like a brewery.


489
0:35:48,155 --> 0:35:51,35
Next time you wanna borrow
some booze, just ask.


490
0:35:51,35 --> 0:35:56,915
We haven't got the right guttering
for sneaking in and out of windows.


491
0:35:56,915 --> 0:35:59,155
Take off your top off.
Let's have a look at your back.


492
0:35:59,155 --> 0:36:0,595
No! No way!


493
0:36:0,595 --> 0:36:2,755
Come on. It's not like
I haven't seen it all before.


494
0:36:2,755 --> 0:36:5,675
When you were little, you used to run
around naked all the time.


495
0:36:5,675 --> 0:36:9,555
Yeah, well, I'm not a kid any more.


496
0:36:9,555 --> 0:36:14,955
Karim.


497
0:36:14,955 --> 0:36:19,655
Right, let's have a look
at your back.


498
0:36:19,655 --> 0:36:20,773
Ow!


499
0:36:20,773 --> 0:36:22,733
Right, right. It's just a bruise.


500
0:36:22,733 --> 0:36:31,853
OK.


501
0:36:31,853 --> 0:36:35,693
You sure you're all right
about going to the pub and things?


502
0:36:35,693 --> 0:36:37,333
I do worry about you, you know.


503
0:36:37,333 --> 0:36:39,853
I'm fine.


504
0:36:39,853 --> 0:36:45,773
Are you still going
to this pool thing today, then?


505
0:36:45,773 --> 0:36:48,413
It doesn't matter
what people think about you.


506
0:36:48,413 --> 0:36:51,653
Yeah, you're not the one who has to
stand in a swimming costume


507
0:36:51,653 --> 0:36:54,973
next to Chloe
with her gravity-defying boobs.


508
0:36:54,973 --> 0:37:1,533
I'm gonna look like a condom
filled with Bolognese sauce.


509
0:37:1,533 --> 0:37:4,853
You remember when you were little,
and we went to Butlin's,


510
0:37:4,853 --> 0:37:9,413
and you said I had a big arse
in front of Sally Crowther's parents?


511
0:37:9,413 --> 0:37:12,213
No.


512
0:37:12,213 --> 0:37:14,133
Why, did it upset you?


513
0:37:14,133 --> 0:37:17,613
You get used to it.


514
0:37:17,613 --> 0:37:19,13
Besides, I was sleeping


515
0:37:19,13 --> 0:37:26,333
with Sally Crowther's dad
at the time, so made no odds, really.


516
0:37:26,333 --> 0:37:32,53
Got it. Yep.


517
0:37:32,53 --> 0:37:34,853
I'm sorry about
what I said the other day.


518
0:37:34,853 --> 0:37:40,853
In the kitchen.


519
0:37:40,853 --> 0:37:42,13
Wait.


520
0:37:42,13 --> 0:37:43,53
Got it.
Mum...


521
0:37:43,53 --> 0:37:44,733
It's all right. Look, look, look.


522
0:37:44,733 --> 0:37:52,613
Oh!


523
0:37:52,613 --> 0:37:57,493
Rae?


524
0:37:57,493 --> 0:37:59,373
Hey, Rae.
Hey.


525
0:37:59,373 --> 0:38:2,733
There's something different
about you today.


526
0:38:2,733 --> 0:38:5,973
Where's your inflatable crocodile?


527
0:38:5,973 --> 0:38:8,333
Actually, I thought you were
fantastic.


528
0:38:8,333 --> 0:38:11,373
There's not many people that could
have styled that out like you did.


529
0:38:11,373 --> 0:38:18,53
Come on. Let's stay here and chat.
I don't fancy a swim.


530
0:38:18,53 --> 0:38:19,133
Why not?


531
0:38:19,133 --> 0:38:21,53
I don't really wanna talk about it.


532
0:38:21,53 --> 0:38:22,453
Tell me.
No.


533
0:38:22,453 --> 0:38:24,13
You'll laugh.


534
0:38:24,13 --> 0:38:25,253
Maybe.


535
0:38:25,253 --> 0:38:28,13
Um...


536
0:38:28,13 --> 0:38:31,133
Well, er...


537
0:38:31,133 --> 0:38:32,453
I've got spots on my back.


538
0:38:32,453 --> 0:38:36,733
Like, back acne.


539
0:38:36,733 --> 0:38:38,213
Bacne?
Yeah.


540
0:38:38,213 --> 0:38:39,493
Show me.


541
0:38:39,493 --> 0:38:40,653
No way.


542
0:38:40,653 --> 0:38:42,773
Show me.


543
0:38:42,773 --> 0:38:45,773
Show me.


544
0:38:45,773 --> 0:38:50,773
No laughing.
All right.


545
0:38:50,773 --> 0:38:52,213
'Oh, my God.


546
0:38:52,213 --> 0:38:55,453
'Even his spots were really sexy!'


547
0:38:55,453 --> 0:38:56,533
Well?


548
0:38:56,533 --> 0:39:1,93
Well, there's hardly anything there.
No-one's gonna see anything.


549
0:39:1,93 --> 0:39:6,853
Look, let's make a deal.
I'll go in if you go in.


550
0:39:6,853 --> 0:39:12,693
All right.


551
0:39:12,693 --> 0:39:55,93
Aarghhh...!


552
0:39:55,93 --> 0:40:6,893
Stop it!


553
0:40:6,893 --> 0:40:8,333
Is there something wrong?


554
0:40:8,333 --> 0:40:9,173
No. Why?


555
0:40:9,173 --> 0:40:11,933
So, why aren't you getting involved?


556
0:40:11,933 --> 0:40:13,453
I'm DJ-ing. Dur.


557
0:40:13,453 --> 0:40:17,93
Well, we don't need a DJ.
Just stick on NOW 33.


558
0:40:17,93 --> 0:40:20,173
Are you kidding me? It's got
Father And Son by Boyzone on it.


559
0:40:20,173 --> 0:40:22,933
Yeah, well,
we'll just get out and skip it.


560
0:40:22,933 --> 0:40:28,453
You're not gonna make friends if you
sit on the sidelines all the time.


561
0:40:28,453 --> 0:40:31,573
Are people talking about that?


562
0:40:31,573 --> 0:40:33,173
They might be.


563
0:40:33,173 --> 0:40:37,493
Look, you don't want people thinking
you're weird, do you?


564
0:40:37,493 --> 0:40:40,293
You don't want people thinking
you're not normal.


565
0:40:40,293 --> 0:40:45,493
Just come in.


566
0:40:45,493 --> 0:41:4,213
You are boring.


567
0:41:4,213 --> 0:41:5,333
Get on my back!


568
0:41:5,333 --> 0:41:6,853
No!
Get on my back.


569
0:41:6,853 --> 0:41:24,653
I wanna see how long
you can hold your breath.


570
0:41:24,653 --> 0:41:40,813
Oh, God.


571
0:41:40,813 --> 0:41:43,573
So, that's it. You went to a party...


572
0:41:43,573 --> 0:41:49,293
and the party was OK.


573
0:41:49,293 --> 0:41:54,413
Rae, these sessions are meant to be
a time when you can open up,


574
0:41:54,413 --> 0:41:58,813
discuss with someone, confidentially,
how you're really feeling.


575
0:41:58,813 --> 0:42:4,253
I told you. It was all right.


576
0:42:4,253 --> 0:42:6,173
Tell me how you're feeling right now,


577
0:42:6,173 --> 0:42:10,693
but be honest.


578
0:42:10,693 --> 0:42:14,733
OK. I'll tell you how l feel, yeah?


579
0:42:14,733 --> 0:42:16,693
Two weeks ago, my wife kicked me out.


580
0:42:16,693 --> 0:42:19,213
I've been stopping on my brother's
couch ever since.


581
0:42:19,213 --> 0:42:22,93
This morning,
I wake up, and there's no milk.


582
0:42:22,93 --> 0:42:25,573
I bought that fucking milk, and he
used it to drown his Sugar Puffs in.


583
0:42:25,573 --> 0:42:29,13
So, with no cup of coffee, I come to
work, I get shat on by a pigeon,


584
0:42:29,13 --> 0:42:37,533
I meet my new patient, and she's
about as open as a nun's foo.


585
0:42:37,533 --> 0:42:43,133
So...how do you feel?


586
0:42:43,133 --> 0:42:46,13
Pffff...


587
0:42:46,13 --> 0:42:51,53
I feel like I hate being here.


588
0:42:51,53 --> 0:42:53,413
I feel like I hate this room.


589
0:42:53,413 --> 0:42:57,333
What do you hate most about it?


590
0:42:57,333 --> 0:42:58,933
Well, the pictures.


591
0:42:58,933 --> 0:43:16,813
They're shit.


592
0:43:16,813 --> 0:43:20,433
Won't you get into trouble for that?


593
0:43:20,433 --> 0:43:21,933
No. If anyone asks,
I'll tell them that you did it.


594
0:43:21,933 --> 0:43:23,253
I'll say you're lying.


595
0:43:23,253 --> 0:43:26,53
Who will they believe? I'm not the
one with a history of mental illness.


596
0:43:26,53 --> 0:43:27,573
Oh, wow!


597
0:43:27,573 --> 0:43:29,613
What about the ink blot?


598
0:43:29,613 --> 0:43:33,213
Oh, that reminds me
of a sanitary towel.


599
0:43:33,213 --> 0:43:38,853
Then out it goes.


600
0:43:38,853 --> 0:43:41,933
Oh!


601
0:43:41,933 --> 0:43:44,933
What about Buster Keaton here?


602
0:43:44,933 --> 0:43:49,853
No. I quite like that one.


603
0:43:49,853 --> 0:43:59,933
Yeah. Me too.


604
0:43:59,933 --> 0:44:3,493
What did your instincts say
about me...


605
0:44:3,493 --> 0:44:8,773
after five seconds?


606
0:44:8,773 --> 0:44:10,453
I can't remember.


607
0:44:10,453 --> 0:44:15,933
I don't believe you.


608
0:44:15,933 --> 0:44:19,813
My instincts said...


609
0:44:19,813 --> 0:44:24,293
that you see yourself
as a fragile thing.


610
0:44:24,293 --> 0:44:26,173
Like a little broken bird


611
0:44:26,173 --> 0:44:29,493
sloshing around in a bottle.


612
0:44:29,493 --> 0:44:33,853
But if you trust me,
if we trust each other...


613
0:44:33,853 --> 0:44:37,813
that you'll be all right.


614
0:44:37,813 --> 0:45:1,453
Because, basically,
I think you're a pretty tough cookie.


615
0:45:1,453 --> 0:45:4,533
- Chop?
- Yes, my dear.


616
0:45:4,533 --> 0:45:7,613
Come and use those big swans
you've been building


617
0:45:7,613 --> 0:45:9,973
to prise my fat butt
out of this slide.


618
0:45:9,973 --> 0:45:22,653
Not a problem, Rae.


619
0:45:22,653 --> 0:45:25,853
Barman!
A lemon Hooch if you'd be so kind.


620
0:45:25,853 --> 0:45:35,653
And turn that shit off.


621
0:45:35,653 --> 0:45:38,93
Who's going to the chippy,
cos I'm yamming?


622
0:45:38,93 --> 0:45:40,213
Oh, maybe we should play a game
for it.


623
0:45:40,213 --> 0:45:42,373
All right. Yeah. I've got
a good one.


624
0:45:42,373 --> 0:45:43,693
What?


625
0:45:43,693 --> 0:45:45,133
Maybe...


626
0:45:45,133 --> 0:45:52,93
last one into the pool should go.


627
0:45:52,93 --> 0:45:53,213
Whoo!


628
0:45:53,213 --> 0:45:55,13
Weh-hey!


629
0:45:55,13 --> 0:45:58,453
Whoo!


630
0:45:58,453 --> 0:46:2,293
'The doctors looked at my legs
and said didn't it hurt?


631
0:46:2,293 --> 0:46:5,333
'"Didn't it hurt so much when you
were doing it


632
0:46:5,333 --> 0:46:7,213
'"that it burnt to breathe?"


633
0:46:7,213 --> 0:46:11,893
'At least they remind me that I
survived.


634
0:46:11,893 --> 0:46:17,573
'But only just.


635
0:46:17,573 --> 0:46:21,333
'I can't believe I've actually
got a group of friends.


636
0:46:21,333 --> 0:46:25,853
'I can't believe I'm finally out.'


637
0:46:25,853 --> 0:48:25,853
'I can't believe they actually think
I'm getting better.'
